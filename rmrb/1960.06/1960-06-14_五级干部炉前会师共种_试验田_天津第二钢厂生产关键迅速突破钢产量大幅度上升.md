(Our newspaper Tianjin, June 13th dispatch) In Tianjin's largest steel plant, Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, cadres from the province, city, district, factory, and workshop levels have met at the furnace to work alongside the workers to develop a streamlined "experimental plot." They are striving to overcome the key factors hindering increased steel production, and the plant's production is booming. The daily steel output on the 6th increased by 16% compared to the 5th, and on the 8th it increased by another 41% compared to the 6th. From June 1st to 12th, the average daily steel output increased by 12% compared to late May. The smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by an average of four minutes, and the lifespan of the converters increased from 16.2 heats to 26.83 heats, an increase of 65.6%. They also created a new lifespan record of fifty-two heats.

Production at the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant was not normal in May. The short lifespan of the converters and the frequent accidents with the pig iron furnaces were the key factors hindering the increase in steel output. In order to break through this weak link, leading cadres from the relevant provincial, municipal, and district departments came to the plant at the end of May and, together with the factory Party committee, launched a major "experimental plot." Led by Yuan Lantian, the secretary of the factory Party committee, Guo Zhengbang, the deputy director of the Hebei Provincial Metallurgical Bureau, Zhang Yiping, the deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Production Committee, Liu Jiju, the first secretary of the Hedong District Committee, and the party and government leading cadres of this factory met at the furnace. Together with workshop cadres, they formed a command post for a streamlined "experimental plot" focused on increasing the lifespan of the converters. From the oil brick workshop responsible for producing furnace-lining materials to the five processes of furnace-lining, transportation, pig iron making, and steelmaking, "experimental plot" groups were organized with the participation of five-level cadres. Through the development of "experimental plots," the important reasons affecting the lifespan of pig iron furnaces and converters were discovered: some pig iron had high sulfur content. Improving the desulfurization efficiency of pig iron furnaces to overcome high sulfur was the central link to extending the furnace lifespan and increasing steel production. At the same time, it was also found that the quality of oil bricks was poor and that technical operating procedures were not being earnestly implemented. Therefore, focusing on overcoming high sulfur, major technical organizational measures were taken. Through experimentation, the proportion of raw materials in the pig iron furnaces was changed, the particle size of the coke entering the furnace was strictly controlled, the raw materials entering the furnace were accurately weighed and cleaned, and advanced desulfurization experience was adopted, bringing the desulfurization efficiency to 83%, an increase of 40% compared to May. This correspondingly doubled the lifespan of the pig iron furnaces compared to late May.

Each link also closely collaborated to increase the lifespan of the converters, vigorously promoting new technologies and new experiences, and breaking through a series of weak links, such as the poor quality of oil bricks and the poor quality of furnace-lining, which affected the lifespan of the converters. This tightly connected the converters, pig iron furnaces, material transportation, steel casting, and overhead cranes, and resulted in a surge in the lifespan of the experimental furnace—converter No. 7—from nineteen or twenty-seven heats to forty-six heats. Steel production doubled.

After each experience was gained in the "experimental plot," the command post immediately organized its promotion, allowing advanced experiences to blossom everywhere. When the lifespan of the experimental furnace reached twenty-seven heats and forty-six heats, on-site meetings and plant-wide worker conferences were successively held, organizing all furnaces and all processes to launch a competition to learn from and catch up with the experimental furnace. Production triumphs were reported frequently, and new records continued to emerge.

Because the five-level leading cadres went deep into the furnace front, it was easy to discover and solve practical problems in a timely manner, which vigorously promoted production. In the past, the oil brick workshop would simply place the finished oil bricks on the ground. Because the ground was uneven and the oil bricks were not dry, they were prone to deformation, which often resulted in defective products. When the leading cadres went deep into the workshop and discovered this problem, they immediately added iron plates and placed the finished oil bricks on the iron plates, which solved the problem of oil brick deformation and improved product quality. When leading comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee went deep into the workshop and discovered that the factory lacked some steel protection equipment that it could not solve on its own, they organized support from other factories, which promoted the daily increase in steel output of this factory.

Five-level cadres went deep into the front line of production and combined with technicians and workers to jointly discuss, decide, and implement production issues, enabling many problems to be solved in a timely manner. In the furnace-lining production, Erfenchang [Second Branch Factory] General Branch Secretary Shu Zhong, technician Liu Jiakun, and the workers jointly studied, making the furnace-lining quality much better than before.

### 五级干部炉前会师共种“试验田”  天津第二钢厂生产关键迅速突破钢产量大幅度上升

    五级干部炉前会师共种“试验田”
    天津第二钢厂生产关键迅速突破钢产量大幅度上升
    本报天津13日电　在天津市最大的炼钢厂——天津第二钢厂，省、市、区、厂、车间的五级干部会师炉前，同职工一起大搞一条龙“试验田”，千方百计突破影响钢产量提高的关键，全厂生产蒸蒸日上。钢的日产量，6日比5日提高16％，8日又比6日提高了41％。6月1日到12日，钢的平均日产量，比5月下旬提高12％，每炉钢的熔炼时间平均缩短四分钟，转炉炉龄由16．2炉提高到26．83炉，提高了65．6％，并且创造了五十二炉的最新炉龄纪录。
    天津第二钢厂5月份生产不够正常。转炉炉龄短，化铁炉事故多，是影响钢产量提高的关键。为了突破这个薄弱环节，省、市、区有关部门的领导干部在5月底到厂，和厂党委一起，大搞“试验田”。由厂党委书记苑兰田挂帅，河北省冶金厅副厅长郭正邦，天津市工业生产委员会副主任张一平，河东区委第一书记刘寄久和这个厂的党政领导干部一起在炉前会师，和车间干部组成了大搞以提高转炉炉龄为中心的一条龙“试验田”指挥部。从生产砌炉用料的油砖车间开始，到砌炉、运输、化铁、炼钢等五个工序，都分别组织了有五级干部参加的“试验田”小组。通过搞“试验田”，发现影响化铁炉、转炉寿命的重要原因，是部分生铁含硫高；而提高化铁炉脱硫效率战胜高硫，是延长炉龄、提高钢产量的中心环节。同时，也发现油砖质量差，没有认真贯彻执行技术操作规程。于是，围绕战胜高硫，大抓技术组织措施。通过试验，改变了化铁炉的配料比例，严格控制焦炭入炉粒度，入炉料做到分量准确、干净，并采用了脱硫先进经验，使脱硫效率达到83％，比5月提高了40％。这便相应地使化铁炉炉龄比5月下旬提高一倍。
    各个环节也围绕提高转炉炉龄紧密协作，大力推广新技术、新经验，突破了影响炉龄的油砖质量差和砌炉质量差的一系列的薄弱环节，使转炉、化铁炉、运料、铸钢和天车等各工序紧密衔接。这样便使试验炉——七号转炉的炉龄由十九炉、二十七炉猛增到四十六炉。钢产量比以前提高了两倍。
    “试验田”每取得一项经验之后，指挥部就立即组织推广，使先进经验普遍开花。试验炉炉龄达到二十七炉、四十六炉时，先后召开了现场会议和全厂职工大会，组织各炉的各工序掀起了学试验炉、赶试验炉的竞赛热潮。生产捷报纷传，新纪录不断出现。
    由于五级领导干部深入炉前，便于及时发现和解决实际问题，有力地推动了生产。油砖车间过去作好油砖就往地上一放，由于地不平，油砖不干，容易变型，常常出残品。这次领导干部深入车间发现这一问题，立即增添了铁板，把作好的油砖放在铁板上，解决了油砖变型的问题，提高了产品质量。天津市委负责同志深入车间发现厂里缺少一些自己不能解决的保钢设备，就组织外厂支援，促进了这个厂钢产量日日上升。
    五级干部深入生产第一线，和技术人员、工人结合，对生产问题共同讨论、共同决定、共同执行，使许多问题及时解决。在砌炉生产中，二分厂总支书记戍中、技术员刘家坤和工人们一起研究，使砌炉质量比以往大大提高。（附图片）
