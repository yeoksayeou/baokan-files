    In the summer production campaign, the Xiaguan District Committee in Nanjing, seeing the shortage of transportation capacity in the Liucheng Commune of Liuhe County, decided to transfer a batch of transportation tools from the district's transportation departments and mobilize relevant factories to rush to produce a batch of transportation tools to help the commune solve its difficulties. The Sisuo Village Street Transportation Team had only about fifty carts, but still extracted six of the best quality carts to support the commune. The director of the Xiaguan Vehicle Repair Factory, after hearing at a district meeting that the Liucheng Commune lacked transportation capacity, immediately convened a meeting of workshop directors, production team leaders, and supply and marketing cadres, and decided to rush to produce a batch of carts for the countryside; after two crash efforts, fifteen carts were produced.

    This district also supported the commune with a batch of ships, based on the characteristics of the smooth waterway of the Liucheng Commune. The District Wheel and Wooden Boat Transportation Company and Jiangsu Shipyard extracted three wooden boats and sent them to the Liucheng Commune. The District Committee also decided to rush to build a 60-horsepower tugboat with a carrying capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 tons for the commune. The Jinling Shipyard and Nanjing Shipyard, responsible for manufacturing the tugboat, both placed this task at the top of the factory's production work. Currently, this tugboat is undergoing mechanical installation and accessory matching work by the Jinling Shipyard and will be completed soon.

    In order to guarantee construction and navigation, they also trained a group of sailors, drivers, and mechanics for the commune.

    赶制车船保夏收
    在夏季大生产运动中，南京下关区委会看到六合县六城公社运输力量不足，决定从全区交通运输部门抽调一批运输工具，并发动有关工厂赶造一批运输工具，来帮助公社解决困难。四所村街道运输队只有五十来部板车，但仍从中抽出了六部质量最好的板车支援公社。下关车辆修造厂厂长在区里开会听说六城公社运输力量不够，回去后，立即召开车间主任、生产组长和供销干部开会，决定为农村赶造一批板车；经过两次突击，赶制出十五部板车。
    这个区还根据六城公社水路畅通的特点，支援公社一批船只。区轮木船运输公司和江苏船厂抽出了三只木船送到六城公社。区委还决定为公社赶制一艘六十马力拖运载重三千到四千吨的拖轮。负责制造拖轮的金陵造船厂和南京造船厂都把这个任务放在全厂生产工作第一位。目前，这艘拖轮正在由金陵造船厂进行机械安装和附件配套工作，不久就可以完工。
    他们为了包造包航，还为公社培训了一批水手、驾驶员和机修工。
