Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 14th: A two-week provocative "exercise" conducted by the United States to coordinate Eisenhower's deployment of a new war of aggression in the Far East concluded on the 13th. This highly publicized American demonstration of "strike power" is one of a series of actions taken by the US to intensify the tense situation in the Far East after it sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Participating in this "exercise" were 120 aircraft, including supersonic jet fighters, reconnaissance planes, and large transport planes, forming a so-called "composite air strike force," all dispatched from bases in the US mainland, with more than 1,000 air force personnel involved. The US authorities clamored that the purpose of this "exercise" was to "demonstrate" the US "capability to move large numbers of aircraft over long distances" and "how much strike power it has to quickly strike an area if trouble arises."

According to announcements by the US authorities at Clark Air Base in the Philippines, this "exercise," conducted in the Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan, involved more than 120 "combat mission" "drills."

    为艾森豪威尔“访问”制造冷战气氛
    美国空军在远东大规模演习
    新华社14日讯　马尼拉消息：美国为配合艾森豪威尔到远东进行新侵略战争部署而举行的两星期挑衅性“演习”，在13日宣告结束。这个美国大吹大擂的显示“打击力量”的“演习”是它破坏四国首脑会议之后加紧在远东制造紧张局势的一系列行动之一。
    参加这次“演习”的有一百二十架飞机，包括超音速喷气式战斗机、侦察机和大型运输机，组成所谓“混合空中攻击部队”，全部由美国本土基地派来，参加的空军人员达一千多人。美国当局叫嚣说，这次“演习”的目的是为了“显示”美国“有长距离调动大量飞机的能力”，并“在一旦发生麻烦的时候迅速打击一个地区有多大打击力量”。
    据美国在菲律宾克拉克空军基地当局宣布，这次在菲律宾、泰国和台湾举行的“演习”，共进行了一百二十次以上的“战斗任务”的“演习”。
