Achievements of the "Shanghai Spring"
Zhang Mei

Recently, I had the opportunity to hear the performances of the "Shanghai Spring" music festival. I felt that the programs were rich, colorful, vivid, and moving. Whether it was in reflecting realistic themes with musical art and serving proletarian politics; in inheriting and innovating national musical traditions, and learning from and nationalizing Western musical traditions; or in the diversification and popularization of musical forms, many efforts have been made and significant achievements have been obtained. This cannot but be said to be a victory for the Party's literary and artistic policies on the music front.

Most of the programs in this music festival were works by young students and young performers. At the same time, we also heard new works by many veteran writers such as He Luting, Sha Mei, Huang Yijun, Wang Yunjie, and Lu Chunling.

The strongest impression this music festival gave people was the emergence of many works reflecting current realistic themes. In addition to the "Happiness River Chorus" created last year, there were also large-scale works such as the piano and orchestra ensemble "Ode to the Great Leap Forward," the orchestral pieces "Beating the War Drums" and "Night Battle," the wind ensemble "Cheering the Great Leap Forward," the two national instrumental ensembles "Pioneering General's Order" and "East China Sea Fishermen's Song," the choral drama "The First Spring of the Sixties," the grand chorus "Happiness Blooms for Ten Thousand Years," "Red Scarf Chorus," storytelling and singing chorus "Xiang Xiuli," and other inspiring works. The keynote of the Great Leap Forward era is the revolutionary spirit and creativity shown by the people in building socialism, and this main aspect can be said to have been grasped correctly. This achievement was not easily obtained. Just imagine, the symphony orchestra, which for decades had taken Western European classical music as its only tradition, now dares to use a large number of Chinese gongs and drums, which were previously considered "too harsh," to express the Great Leap Forward. Isn't this a manifestation of the spirit of breaking the rules, daring to think and act, and being brave in innovation? Of course, some people suggest that in the future, in addition to expressing the enthusiastic side, attention should also be paid to expressing the magnificent and profound side. This suggestion should be considered.

Advocating writing works with realistic themes is of paramount importance in current musical creation. Because the primary task of literary and artistic workers is to educate the people with communist ideology; and the current realistic struggle life runs through the spirit of the general line, is closely related to the people, and embodies the thoughts and wishes of the people; writing realistic themes with a communist worldview gives us the most intimate common language with the vast audience. If you want to ask how to make symphony music accepted by the masses, the first question is whether what is written is the thing that the masses are most concerned about. If you don't grasp this point and write about the joys or sorrows of individuals or a few people, then no matter how popular the language is, the audience will be indifferent and uninterested. The reason why these works are so popular with the broad masses of listeners is precisely this. The emergence of so many works reflecting realistic themes in this "Shanghai Spring" shows that many composers, under the brilliant light of the general line, are full of the emotions of the times and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. This cannot but make people feel the brilliance and great prospects of China's music industry.

I feel that composing is indeed difficult, and it is even more difficult to teach students to compose in the classrooms of the academy. Professors can only guide students to learn from the creative experience of their predecessors and use communist ideas to inspire students to carry out creative practice. If the students do not have a communist worldview, how can you "teach" them to write passionate works? Since liberation, especially in the past two years, the music academies and music groups have carried out mass movements of ideological transformation, implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, and it is not only the professors who educate the students, but the Party that educates the students, the masses that educate the students, and the entire Great Leap Forward society that educates the students. In this way, we have found an advanced method of training composers. This is what the Party taught us.

In addition to writing realistic themes, revolutionary historical themes have also been given attention, and large-scale works such as the symphonies "Dawn of the Orient" and "The War of Resistance Against Japan," the piano concerto "Liu Zhidan," the cello concerto "Gada Meilin," and the trombone and orchestra ensemble "Gada Meilin Theme Fantasy" have appeared. Using a communist worldview to write revolutionary historical themes to a certain extent expresses the revolutionary spirit of our Party and the spirit of the people's heroes in history resisting feudal forces and national oppression, and inspires the revolutionary enthusiasm of the audience. In terms of writing skills, the fact that our young composers can master these large-scale forms and more complex symphonic techniques in order to better reflect the complex revolutionary struggle is a gratifying achievement in music education. In order to understand the heroic deeds of Gada Meilin, the authors also went to Inner Mongolia to conduct investigations. This serious spirit is worthy of our learning. In our history, the people have written countless epic poems with their blood, especially since the founding of our Party, we have carried out earth-shaking revolutionary struggles, which are permeated with the communist revolutionary spirit. It is an important theme for conducting communist ideological education to the people, and these themes are waiting for our composers to depict them with their own efforts. In this regard, we still have to make tremendous efforts.

Another prominent impression given by this music festival is the efforts made in inheriting national musical traditions and innovating them, and in learning from Western musical traditions and nationalizing them. The violin concerto "The Butterfly Lovers" uses some melodies from Yue opera as material, but it is not limited to the style of Yue opera melodies. It has developed into a large-scale work and promotes the spirit of Zhu Yingtai's resistance to feudal forces, which is relatively successful. The storytelling and singing performance "Xiang Xiuli" and the choral drama "The First Spring of the Sixties" inherit the tradition of storytelling and singing and develop them to varying degrees into choruses; using this musical language to express realistic themes has been warmly welcomed by the audience. In terms of performance, many small programs, such as the small choruses "Orange Tree," "Carrying a Basket Up the Mountain," "Dragon Boat Tune," and "Together," the violin ensemble "Mountain Song," "Pushing a Cart," the small orchestra "Finding the Trick," etc., are full of national characteristics, and the expressions are rich, vivid, and natural, which is particularly likable. The piano and orchestra ensemble "Ode to the Great Leap Forward" adopts the national instrument Suona in the Western orchestra to express the joyful atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward, which cannot be replaced by Western brass instruments; at the same time, the magnificent and passionate sound expressed by Western brass instruments cannot be replaced by Suona. This practice of adopting various musical instruments to serve the revolution according to the needs of the content can be affirmed.

With excitement, I congratulate the great leap forward of Shanghai music workers and wish them more brilliant achievements.

    “上海之春”的成就
    章枚
    最近有机会听到“上海之春”音乐会演，感到节目丰富多彩，生动感人，无论在用音乐艺术反映现实题材、为无产阶级政治服务上；在民族音乐传统的继承与推陈出新，和西洋音乐传统的学习和民族化上；在音乐体裁的多样化和群众化上，都作了许多努力，并获得显著的成绩。这不能不说是党的文艺政策在音乐战线上的胜利。
    这次音乐会演的节目大部分是青年学生和青年演奏员的作品。同时，我们也听到了贺绿汀、沙梅、黄贻钧、王云阶、陆春龄等许多老作家的新作品。
    这次音乐会演给人最强烈的印象是产生了许多反映当前现实题材的作品。除了去年创作的《幸福河大合唱》以外，又创作了像钢琴与管弦乐队合奏的大型作品《跃进颂歌》，管弦乐《擂战鼓》和《夜战》，管乐合奏《欢呼大跃进》，民族器乐合奏《闯将令》两首和《东海渔歌》，合唱剧《六十年代第一春》，大合唱《幸福花开万年长》，《红领巾合唱》、评弹合唱《向秀丽》等等振奋人心的作品。大跃进时代的基调就是人民群众在建设社会主义中所表现出的那股革命干劲和创造性，这一主要方面可以说是抓对了。这成绩并不是轻易得来的。试想，几十年来以西欧古典音乐为唯一传统的交响乐团，现在居然敢于采用大量过去人们认为“太刺耳”的中国大锣大鼓来表现大跃进，岂非打破常规敢想敢干，勇于革新精神的表现？当然，有人建议今后除了表现热烈的一面以外，还要注意表现雄浑和深厚的一面，这意见是应该考虑的。
    提倡写现实题材的作品，在目前的音乐创作上，具有头等重要的意义。因为文艺工作者的首要任务就是以共产主义思想教育人民；而当前的现实斗争生活贯彻着总路线的精神，与人民群众血肉相关，体现着人民群众的思想和愿望；以共产主义世界观来写现实题材，就与广大听众有了最亲切的共同语言。如果要问怎样才能使交响乐为群众所接受，首先就是写的是不是群众所最关切的事情的问题。假如不抓住这一点，而去写个人的或少数人的喜或愁，则不管语言多么群众化，听众也会漠然不发生兴趣。上述这些作品所以受到广大听众的欢迎，原因就在这里。这次“上海之春”出现了这么多反映现实题材的作品，说明许多作曲家在总路线光辉照耀下，充满了时代情感和大跃进的精神，这不能不使人感到我国音乐事业前途的光辉和远大。
    我觉得作曲这事情确实是难，关在学院教室里教会学生作曲就更难。教授只能指导学生去学习前人的创作经验，用共产主义的思想去启发学生进行创作实践。假如学生没有共产主义的世界观，你怎能
  “教”他写出充满热情的作品？解放以来，特别是两年来，音乐学院和音乐团体进行了思想改造的群众运动，贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，不光是靠教授去教育学生，而是党教育着学生，群众教育着学生，整个大跃进的社会教育着学生。这样，我们就找到了培养作曲家的先进方法。这又是党教我们的。
    除了写现实题材外，革命的历史题材也受到重视，出现了交响乐《东方的曙光》和《抗日战争》、钢琴协奏曲《刘志丹》、大提琴协奏曲《嘎达梅林》和长号与乐队合奏曲《嘎达梅林主题幻想曲》等大型作品。用共产主义世界观来写革命历史题材在一定程度上表现了我们党的革命精神和历史上人民英雄的反抗封建势力和民族压迫的精神，鼓舞了听众的革命热情。在写作技术上，我国青年作曲家们能掌握这些大型体裁和较复杂的交响性手法，以便更好地反映复杂的革命斗争，是音乐教学上的可喜的收获。为了了解嘎达梅林的英雄事迹，作者们还到内蒙古去进行调查，这种认真的精神是值得我们学习的。我国历史上人民群众用鲜血写成了无数可歌可泣的史诗，特别是我们党成立以来进行了翻天复地的革命斗争，其中贯串着共产主义的革命精神，是向人民群众进行共产主义思想教育的重要主题，这些题材等待着我国作曲家用自己的心血去描绘它。在这方面，我们还要进行巨大的努力。
    这次音乐会演中，给人另一个突出的印象，是在继承民族音乐传统并加以推陈出新和向西洋音乐传统学习并加以民族化方面的努力。小提琴协奏曲《梁山伯与祝英台》以越剧部分曲调作为素材，但并不局限于越剧曲调的风格，发展成为一部大型作品，发扬了祝英台对封建势力的反抗精神，是比较成功的。评弹表演唱《向秀丽》和合唱剧《六十年代第一春》，继承了评弹传统，并加以不同程度的发展成为合唱；用这种音乐语言来表现现实题材，受到听众的热烈欢迎。在表演上，许多小节目，如小合唱《柑子树》、《背起背篓上山来》、《龙船调》和《在一起》，小提琴齐奏《山歌》、《推小车》，小乐队《找窍门》等等，都充满了民族特色，表情丰富、生动而自然，特别令人喜爱。钢琴与乐队合奏《跃进颂歌》，在西洋管弦乐队中采取了民族乐器唢呐来表现大跃进中的欢乐气氛，这是西洋的铜管乐器所不能代替的；同时，西洋的铜管乐器所表现的雄伟激昂的音响也是唢呐所不能代替的。这种根据内容的需要，采取各种不同的乐器来为革命服务的做法是可以肯定的。
    我怀着兴奋的心情，祝贺上海音乐工作者的大跃进，并且预祝他们获得更辉煌的成就。
