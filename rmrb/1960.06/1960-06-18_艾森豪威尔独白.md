Chapter One

I might as well go all the way, might as well carry this disgrace to the very end.
The mask of peace is torn, so I’ll just add fuel to the fire.
Helicopter, bulletproof vest, to guard against becoming a mummy. (Note)
Creating a new world record, I’m number one in getting cursed and slapped.
I'll be a teacher by negative example, helping, after all, in a way that backfires.
Nowhere in the East am I welcome, and in Paris, I got a slap in the face.
Soviet protests are like rockets, China saw through me long ago.
How can a paper tiger be frightening? A clay giant is ruined by water.
It seems we are fools,妄想global hegemony.
A noose around the neck, we put it on ourselves and let others pull it.
Fortunately, life is insured, and even in disaster, money will come in.
A last-ditch gamble with my old life, swinging on a volcano's crater.
(Note) European proverb: "He who takes a mummy becomes a mummy."

Chapter Two

Tokyo news is shocking, hundreds killed and injured.
Though Kishi is loyal to me, I am, after all, a plague god.
Postponing the visit is a good opportunity, I had already intended to do so.
The Japanese people are too scary, I really don't have the courage to go.
Miss Kazuha Niwa’s spirit not at rest, makes my soul scatter and fly.
My prestige is completely swept away, coming in high spirits and leaving in disappointment.
Not being quick enough to see the signs was my mistake, even more annoyed than in Paris.
Hitting walls on all sides is nerve-wracking, how to get through this difficult situation?
It seems things are not to be trifled with, no mood to play golf anymore.
After all, I became a mummy, America is on the decline.
Sidewinder missiles hit themselves, atomic submarines explode.
I shout a slogan to myself: Damn Eisenhower!

    艾森豪威尔独白
    郭沫若
    第一章一不做来二不休，出丑总要出尽头。和平面具撕破了，索性火上去加油。直升飞机避弹衣，提防先成木乃伊。（注）创造世界新纪录，挨骂挨抽我第一。反面教员我当上，帮忙毕竟帮倒忙。东方处处不欢迎，巴黎吃了大耳光。苏联抗议如火箭，中国把我早看穿。纸糊老虎怎骇人？泥塑巨人遭水难。看来我们是傻瓜，妄想全球称独霸。绞绳套在脖子上，自己套上让人拉。好在生命已保险，纵使遭难要进钱。孤注一掷拼老命，火山口上打秋千。（注）欧洲谚语：“取木乃
      伊者成为木乃伊”。

    第二章东京消息令人惊，打死打伤几百人。岸姓虽然忠于我，而我毕竟是瘟神。延期访问是良机，我也早已有此意。日本人民太可怕，实在没有胆量去。丹羽光子灵不昧，使我魄散魂已飞。我的威信全扫地，乘兴而来败兴归。见机不早是我错，比在巴黎更恼火。八面碰壁伤脑筋，这个难关怎样过？看来事情难马虎，无心再打高尔夫。毕竟成了木乃伊，美国已走下坡路。响尾蛇弹打自己，原子潜艇爆炸矣。我向自己喊口号：该死艾森豪威尔！
