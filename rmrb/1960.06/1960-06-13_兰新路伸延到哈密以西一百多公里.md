Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th June: The track-laying project west of Hami on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is being intensified. At present, the railway track has extended to the Liaodun Station, 116 kilometers west of Hami, and is advancing towards Shanshan.

On the more than 500-kilometer line from Hami to Urumqi, all twelve tunnels across the Tianshan Mountains have been completed; most of the construction projects for more than 1,000 large and small bridges and culverts and the houses and station yards of more than 40 stations along the line have also been completed; and another 220 kilometers of roadbed has also been basically repaired. The section from Hami to Urumqi is a section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in Xinjiang with relatively complex geological conditions. There are saline-alkali land, swamp areas, and hundreds of kilometers of uninhabited and water-scarce Gobi Desert. The bridge and culvert and roadbed raising project are the key to this section. Within 50 li east of Shanshan, five large bridges with a total length of 600 meters need to be built. Other medium and small bridges are even more scattered. With the arrival of the rainy season, the construction of bridges, culverts, and roadbeds here is very urgent, and the railway construction workers are currently overcoming various difficulties to ensure the rapid progress of the construction.

    兰新路伸延到哈密以西一百多公里
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　兰新铁路哈密以西的铺轨工程正在加紧进行。目前，这条铁路的路轨已经伸延到哈密以西一百一十六公里的瞭墩车站，正在向鄯善方面前进。
    从哈密到乌鲁木齐五百多公里的线路上，横穿天山的十二座隧道已经全部建成；沿线一千多座大小桥涵和四十多个车站的房屋、站场建设工程，绝大部分也已完工；另有二百二十公里的路基也基本上修好了。从哈密到乌鲁木齐是兰新铁路在新疆境内地质情况比较复杂的一段。这里有盐碱地、沼泽区和几百公里无人少水的戈壁。桥涵和路基加高工程是这一地段内的关键。鄯善以东五十里以内，就需修建全长六百米长的五座大桥。其它中、小型桥更是星罗棋布。随着雨季的到来，这里修建桥涵和路基的工程非常紧迫，筑路职工们目前正在克服各种困难，保证施工高速进展。
