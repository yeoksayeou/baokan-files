Continuous Utilization Leaving Nothing to Waste
Cangxian County Uses Scrap Materials from Large Factories to Make Small Commodities

(Our report) More than forty street and commune/brigade-run factories in Cangxian County, Hebei Province, are using scrap materials from large factories to produce a wide variety of small daily-use commodities. In May alone, commercial departments purchased more than 2.2 million pieces, with a total value of more than 110,000 yuan. Currently, more than 290 kinds of products are on the market, including fly swatters, insoles, hair clips, and hair forks.

In order to help production departments solve the problem of raw materials for small commodities, the commercial departments of Cangxian County first organized large factories to pair up with small factories, so that the scrap materials from large factories could be utilized as soon as they were produced, linking each stage tightly and leaving nothing to waste. In the past, the Xingji Bristle Factory treated the scraps from bristle production as crude fertilizer. Now, under the leadership of the local Party committee, commercial workers have helped the production teams establish a blanket processing factory and a brush processing factory. The longer, smoother scraps are used for making brushes, and the shorter, tangled scraps are used for making blankets. All the bristle scraps are fully utilized without any waste, with an average monthly production of more than 600 blankets and more than 8,000 shoe brushes. Secondly, several small factories are organized to use the scrap materials from large factories, or one factory is organized to use the scrap materials from several factories. For example, the bamboo ware factory's scrap materials are bamboo sliver ends; the iron sieve factory's scrap materials are broken iron gauze; and the garment factory's scrap materials are fabric scraps. The commercial department used these scrap materials, which the three factories had previously treated as waste, to help Xinghua Street build a fly swatter processing factory. Bamboo sliver ends are used for the handle, broken gauze for the swatting surface, and fabric scraps for the edges, making exquisite fly swatters. In just over twenty days in May, more than 10,000 were produced, saving more than 600 feet of iron gauze, 500 feet of cotton cloth, and more than 1,200 catties of bamboo slivers. The third is to organize continuous utilization. For example, the knitting factory produces more than 1,800 catties of waste yarn cones every month due to too much thread picking or dirty and broken cones. These waste yarn cones are first processed by the clothing factory into substandard vests; the cuffs and collars cut from the vests are then transported to the sewing factory to be pieced together into large pieces for making beautiful pillow cores; the remaining pointed pieces from making pillow cores are then made into sock bottoms or insoles. The remaining fabric scraps are sent to the Xinghua Street toy factory to make jackets, pants, shoes, and hats for cloth dolls.

    连续利用  一点不剩
    沧县利用大工厂下脚料制小商品
    本报讯　河北沧县四十多个街道和社、队办的工厂，利用大工厂的下脚料制成各种各样日用小商品。仅5月份一个月，商业部门就收购二百二十多万件，总值十一万多元。目前上市的已经有蝇拍、鞋垫、发卡子、头杈子等二百九十多种。
    沧县商业部门为了帮助生产部门解决小商品生产的原料，首先是组织大工厂配小工厂，让大工厂的下脚料随下落随利用，环环扣紧，点点不漏。兴济毛鬃厂，过去把生产鬃毛打下来的碎渣子，都作粗肥料处理。现在商业职工就在当地党委的领导下协助生产队分别建立了一个毛毯加工厂，一个毛刷加工厂。长点顺点的作毛刷，短点乱点的作毛毯，所有毛渣子都一点不丢的全部利用起来，每月平均生产毛毯六百多条，鞋刷八千多个。其次是组织几个小工厂利用大工厂的下脚料，或组织一个厂利用几个厂的下脚料。如竹器厂的下脚料是竹片头；铁筛子制造厂的下脚料是碎铁纱布，缝纫厂的下脚料是碎布边。商业部门就用这三个工厂过去都当废品处理的下脚料，帮助兴华街建成了一座蝇拍加工厂。竹片头作拍把，碎纱布作拍面，碎布作边，制成了很精美的蝇拍。仅5月份的二十多天就生产了一万多个，节约了铁纱布六百多尺，棉布五百尺，竹片一千二百多斤。再次是组织连续利用。如针织厂每月都出一千八百多斤挑线太多或脏了破了的坏筒子纱，这些坏筒子纱，首先由衣帽厂加工成残次品的背心；作背心剪下来的袖口和领口，又运到缝纫厂接成大片制成漂亮的枕心；作枕心剩余的尖尖块块，又作成袜底或鞋垫。再剩下的纱布头头块块，送到兴华街玩具厂，做成布娃娃的袄裤，鞋帽。
