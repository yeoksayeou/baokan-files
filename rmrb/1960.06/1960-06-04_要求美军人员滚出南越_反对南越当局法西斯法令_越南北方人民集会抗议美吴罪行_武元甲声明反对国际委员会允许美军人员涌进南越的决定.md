Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 2nd: People in various parts of North Vietnam have recently held rallies to protest the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group's" continued presence in South Vietnam and to demand that the Vietnam International Commission re-examine and revoke its erroneous conclusion that South Vietnam's Fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959 is unrelated to the Geneva Accords.

In recent days, over 13,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi have held separate rallies and selected eight delegations to meet with representatives of the International Commission's Hanoi office, demanding that the International Commission reconsider its conclusion on this decree, which violates the Geneva Accords.

Legal workers in Haiphong, at a recent rally, expressed their full support for the views expressed in the letter from the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Commission on this issue, supported the position of the Vietnam Lawyers Association, and firmly refused to recognize the International Commission's conclusion on the aforementioned decree.

More than 20,000 representatives from all strata of society, political parties, and organizations in Nam Dinh passed a resolution at a conference on May 29th opposing the continued presence of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission re-examine its conclusion on South Vietnam's Decree No. 10 of 1959, and forcing the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to abolish this fascist decree. The resolution also demanded that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique immediately restore the freedom of students and intellectuals who have recently been illegally arrested.

The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Joint Committee for the Demilitarized Zone stationed in the Vinh Linh area handed over twelve petitions signed by 1,641 people to the International Commission on May 31st, demanding that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique immediately abolish Decree No. 10 of 1959.

In addition, people in Ho Xa City (the seat of Vinh Linh District) have recently submitted 110 protest letters to the 76th International Team, and more than 80,000 people of all ethnic groups in Thai Binh Province have held 136 rallies. The Vietnam Women's Union and the Central Committee of the Democratic Party also issued statements on this issue at the end of May.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 3rd: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission, on May 27th, expressing opposition to the International Commission's adoption, despite the strong opposition of the Polish representative, of a resolution considering the replacement of French military personnel by military advisors of US imperialism in South Vietnam to be "legal."

Vice Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ta Quang Buu, announced this telegram at a press conference held today.

The telegram stated, "In order to continue implementing the Geneva Accords and to consolidate the cause of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army requests the International Commission: 1. To negotiate with the South Vietnamese authorities to urge them to stop all activities that increase the number of US military personnel stationed in South Vietnam, and to disband and withdraw the 'US Military Assistance Advisory Group', which is a tool of US imperialism for interference and war preparation in South Vietnam. 2. To cancel the aforementioned resolution of the International Commission to avoid serious consequences for the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and the consolidation of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The telegram stated that it is known that in order to ensure the fundamental principles of Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and to consolidate lasting peace in Indochina, the Geneva Accords clearly stipulated that the French Expeditionary Force must withdraw from Vietnam and that "all reinforcements and new military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam."

The telegram pointed out that, in principle, the US Military Advisory Group should also have been permanently withdrawn from Vietnam at the same time as the French Expeditionary Force withdrew. However, on the contrary, US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities illegally maintained this "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" and continuously increased the military personnel of this organization.

The telegram stated that the International Commission also acknowledged in its Ninth Report to the two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference that the United States had dispatched 759 US military personnel to South Vietnam in 1956 and 1957 alone. At present, the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" has become the US General Command in South Vietnam, stepping up the realization of expanding armaments and preparing for war, stepping up the organization, training, and equipment of South Vietnamese military forces, and guiding South Vietnam in the construction of military bases, military warehouses, and strategic highways, and supervising and directing South Vietnam's military "sweeps" and plans to suppress and massacre former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam. Since the restoration of peace, the existence of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" and its activities over the years have clearly seriously violated the Geneva Accords.

The telegram pointed out that the International Commission's majority vote to allow US military personnel to replace French military personnel is a complete violation of the spirit and text of the Geneva Accords and will inevitably lead to serious consequences.

The telegram also pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities had used the International Commission's 1958 resolution allowing the import of new weapons into South Vietnam to replace the weapons of the French Expeditionary Force to vigorously import new US weapons into South Vietnam, thereby making the situation in Vietnam even more tense.

The telegram stated: "The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, which, together with the entire Vietnamese people, is unremittingly struggling for the national independence, democracy, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, and for peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, resolutely opposes any conspiracy and action by US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine and distort the Geneva Accords. Therefore, it cannot accept the International Commission's decision to allow US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities to transport US military personnel and weapons into South Vietnam to replace French military personnel and weapons."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: Senior Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission, today, again requesting the International Commission to immediately reconsider and cancel its conclusion on Decree No. 10 of 1959 of the South Vietnamese authorities.

The telegram stated, "After I once again proved in a letter to the International Commission on May 12th that Decree No. 10 of 1959 seriously violated the Geneva Accords, I emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities would use the International Commission's conclusion that Decree No. 10 of 1959 was unrelated to the Geneva Accords to cover up and strengthen their acts of retaliation against former resistance personnel and their families."

The telegram said, "In fact, the Saigon Special Military Tribunal used Decree No. 10 of 1959 to retaliate against seven former resistance personnel in Long Xuyen on May 27th." The telegram also exposed the absurd propaganda made by Saigon Radio on Decree No. 10 of 1959 after this.

The telegram emphasized, "The South Vietnamese authorities are stepping up their use of this conclusion and the name of the International Commission to cover up their crimes of arresting and killing patriotic people in South Vietnam, especially former resistance personnel," "This situation is threatening the lives, freedom, and democratic rights of former resistance personnel in South Vietnam."

The telegram stated, "For the sake of fulfilling the Geneva Accords, I earnestly request the International Commission to immediately reconsider and cancel the International Commission's conclusion on Decree No. 10 of 1959, and at the same time take some other measures as I suggested in my letter of May 12th."

The measures that Senior Colonel Ha Van Lau suggested the International Commission take in that letter included: conducting necessary investigations into cases of retaliation by the South Vietnamese authorities against former resistance personnel based on Decree No. 10 of 1959; and at the same time, immediately negotiating with the South Vietnamese authorities to demand that the South Vietnamese authorities stop implementing the various cases sentenced by the "Saigon Special Military Tribunal."

    要求美军人员滚出南越　反对南越当局法西斯法令
    越南北方人民集会抗议美吴罪行
    武元甲声明反对国际委员会允许美军人员涌进南越的决定
    新华社河内2日电　越南北方各地人民最近纷纷集会，抗议“美国军事援助顾问团”赖在南越，并且要求越南国际委员会重新审查并撤销它认为南越1959年第十号法西斯法令同日内瓦协议无关的错误结论。
    几天来，河内市各界人民一万三千多人曾分别举行集会，并推选八个代表团会见国际委员会驻河内办事处代表，要求国际委员会重新考虑它对这个违反日内瓦协议的法令所作出的结论。
    海防市法律工作者在最近举行的集会上，表示完全支持越南人民军总司令部联络代表团就这个问题给国际委员会的信中的观点，支持越南法律工作者协会的立场，坚决不承认国际委员会对上述法令所作的结论。
    南定各阶层人民、各政党、团体代表两万多人在5月29日举行的大会上通过决议，反对“美国军事援助顾问团”继续赖在南越，要求国际委员会重新审查它对南越1959年第十号法令所作出的结论，并迫使吴庭艳当局废除这个法西斯法令。决议还要求美国——吴庭艳集团立即恢复最近被他们非法逮捕的学生和知识分子的自由。
    驻在永灵区的非军事区联合委员会小组越南民主共和国方面的代表5月31日把十二份有一千六百四十一人签名的要求美国——吴庭艳集团立即废除1959年第十号法令的建议书，转交给国际委员会。
    此外，胡舍市（永灵区府所在地）人民最近已向第七十六国际小组递交了一百一十份抗议书，太平省各族人民八万多人举行了一百三十六次集会，越南全国妇女联合会和民主党中央委员会在5月底也曾就这个问题分别发表了声明。
    新华社河内3日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲大将5月27日打电报给越南国际监督和监察委员会主席安萨里，表示反对国际委员会不顾波兰代表的坚决反对，通过了认为美帝国主义的军事顾问在南越取代法国军事人员的行为是“合法的”的决议。
    越南民主共和国国防部副部长谢光宝在今天举行的记者招待会上公布了这封电报。
    电报说，“为了继续执行日内瓦协议，为了巩固印度支那和东南亚的和平事业，越南人民军总司令部要求国际委员会：一、向南越当局交涉，促使它停止增加驻南越美国军事人员的一切活动，解散和撤走在南越的美帝国主义进行干涉和备战的工具——“美国军事援助顾问团”。二、取消国际委员会的上述决议，以避免对继续执行日内瓦协议和巩固印度支那和东南亚和平发生严重后果。”
    电报说，大家知道，为了保证实现越南的独立、主权、领土完整的根本原则，以及巩固印度支那的持久和平，日内瓦协议明确规定，法国远征军必须撤出越南和“禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南”。
    电报指出，按理在法国远征军撤出越南的同时，美国军事顾问团也应当永远撤出越南。但相反，美帝国主义和南越当局非法维持了这个“美国军事援助顾问团”，而且还不断增加这个组织的军事人员。
    电报说，国际委员会在给日内瓦会议两位主席的第九号报告中也曾经承认：仅在1956、1957两年中，美国向南越增派了七百五十九名美国军事人员。目前“美国军事援助顾问团”已经成为美国在南越的总司令部，正在加紧实现扩军备战加紧组织、训练、装备南越军事力量，并指导南越建设军事基地、军用仓库和战略公路，监视和指导南越的军事“扫荡”和镇压，残杀前抗战人员以及南越爱国人民的计划。和平恢复以来，“美国军事援助顾问团”的存在和它几年来的活动，很明显地严重违反了日内瓦协议。
    电报指出，国际委员会以多数票通过的允许美国军事人员来代替法国军事人员的决议，是完全违反日内瓦协议的精神和条文的，而且将不免导致严重后果。
    电报还指出，南越当局曾经利用国际委员会1958年允许向南越运进新武器以代替法国远征军的武器的决议，大力向南越运进美国新式武器，从而使越南的形势更加紧张。
    电报说：“同全体越南人民一起为越南的民族独立、民主和领土完整，为印度支那和东南亚的和平而不懈斗争的越南人民军总司令部，坚决反对美帝国主义和南越当局破坏和歪曲日内瓦协议的任何阴谋和行动，因此决不能接受国际委员会允许美帝国主义和南越当局向南越运进美国军事人员和武器来代替法国军事人员和武器的决定。”
    新华社河内1日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校今天打电报给越南国际监督和监察委员会主席安萨里，再次要求国际委员会立即重新考虑和取消它就南越当局1959年第十号法令所作出的结论。
    电报说，“5月12日，我在写给国际委员会的信中再一次证明1959年第十号法令严重违反日内瓦协议以后，曾着重指出，南越当局将利用国际委员会认为1959年第十号法令同日内瓦协议无关的结论来掩盖和加强它们对前抗战人员和他们的家属的报复行为。”
    电报说，“实际上，西贡特别军事法庭5月27日在龙川已经施用1959年第十号法令对七名前抗战人员进行报复”。电报又揭露西贡广播电台在这以后对1959年第十号法令所作的荒谬宣传。
    电报强调说，“南越当局正在加紧利用这个结论和国际委员会的名义来掩盖它们逮捕、杀害南越爱国人民，首先是前抗战人员的罪行”，“这种情况正威胁着在南越的前抗战人员的生命和自由民主权利”。
    电报说，“为了履行日内瓦协议的利益，我恳切地要求国际委员会立即重新考虑和取消国际委员会关于1959年第十号法令的结论，同时采取如同我在5月12日信中所建议的一些其他措施。”
    何文校大校在那封信中建议国际委员会采取的措施包括：对南越当局根据1959年第十号法令报复前抗战人员的案件进行必要的调查工作；同时立即向南越当局交涉，要求南越当局停止执行“西贡特别军事法庭”所判决的各项案件。
