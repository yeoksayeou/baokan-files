Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th. After thirteen days of effort, the Beijing Institute of Geology Mountaineering Team collectively and safely ascended a 7100-meter peak in the Jishi Mountains in Qinghai Province on June 2nd. This marks the first time a mountaineering team composed of Chinese teachers and students has conquered a mountain above 7000 meters above sea level.

The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of China sent a telegram to the mountaineering team today, congratulating them on their glorious achievement.

The Jishi Mountains are located southwest of Xining, with steep slopes, some reaching 60 to 70 degrees, and are covered with many ice and snow fissures and rock crevices. In the past, no one had ever conquered it, thus it was called a "geographical blank spot."

The Beijing Institute of Geology Mountaineering Team was led by Bai Jinxiao, an assistant teacher from the Physical Education Research Office of the institute. The team included three other assistant teachers and four students from the institute, as well as a student majoring in meteorology from Peking University and a telegraph operator. They departed from Beijing for Xining on April 29th this year. On May 8th, they left Xining with Ding Yuanzong, a representative from the Qinghai Provincial Sports Commission, and headed towards the mountains.

On May 20th, all eleven members of the team arrived at the foot of the mountain, climbed to a height of 4,805 meters above sea level, and established a base camp.

On May 21st, the mountaineering team began their first march, reaching a height of 5,800 meters above sea level, and established their second camp. Here, they practiced mountaineering techniques such as ice and snow operations and rock operations, while also scouting routes for attacking the summit.

On May 26th, the mountaineering team departed from the second camp and climbed up the east side of the mountain, but when they reached an area of about 6,000 meters above sea level, they were blocked by a crevasse five or six meters wide and could not advance. The mountaineering team then returned to the base camp.

On May 29th, the mountaineering team moved the base camp to a place on the north side of the mountain at 5,119 meters above sea level, preparing to attack the summit from another route.

On June 1st, the battle to attack the summit began. Bai Jinxiao, Ding Yuanzong, Liu Zhaochang, He Huizhi, Ai Shunfeng, Wang Wenzhang, Zhou Pinwei, and Wang Hongbao finally reached the summit at 13:20 Beijing time on June 2nd, achieving victory.

Currently, the mountaineering team members remain in the mountainous area, conducting scientific investigations and research on geology, glaciers, and other aspects of the Jishi Mountains.

Mountaineering activities are very popular at the Beijing Institute of Geology. Currently, 97% of the students in the school have obtained the "Mountaineering Athlete" grade title issued by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. In December 1958, a total of fifty-four male and female athletes from the institute's mountaineering team climbed the main peak of the "July 1st" Glacier in the Qilian Mountains in Gansu Province, which is 5,215 meters above sea level. In May of last year, another forty-six members of the institute's mountaineering team climbed the main peak of Mount Taibai in Shaanxi Province, which is 4,113 meters above sea level. In July of last year, three of the nine athletes who broke the world record for women's climbing height while climbing Mount Muztagh Ata in Xinjiang, which is 7,546 meters above sea level, were students from this institute.

### 登山运动又一光辉成就  北京地质学院登山队登上7100米的山峰

    登山运动又一光辉成就
    北京地质学院登山队登上7100米的山峰
    新华社西宁4日电　北京地质学院登山队经过十三天的努力，在6月2日集体安全地登上了青海省境内积石山的拔海七千一百米的山峰。这是由我国教师和学生等组成的登山队，第一次征服了拔海七千米以上的高山。
    我国国家体委今天打电报给登山队，祝贺他们获得了这一光辉的成就。
    积石山位于西宁西南，山坡陡峭，有的地方达六、七十度，并布有许多冰雪裂缝和岩石裂缝。过去，从来没有人征服它，因而它被称为“地理上的空白点”。
    北京地质学院登山队由这个学院体育教研室助教白进孝率领，队中包括这个学院的另外三名助教和四名学生，以及一名北京大学气象专业的学生和一名电报员。他们在今年4月29日由北京出发前往西宁。5月8日，又同青海省体委的代表丁原宗一起离开西宁，向山区进发。
    5月20日，全队十一人到达山下后，攀登到拔海四千八百零五米的地方，并建立了大本营。
    5月21日，登山队开始第一次行军，到达拔海五千八百米的高度后，又建立了第二个营地。在这里，他们一面进行冰雪作业和岩山作业等登山技术的练习，一面侦察突击峰顶的路线。
    5月26日，登山队从第二号营地出发，沿这个山的东面向上攀登，但到达拔海六千米左右的地带时，被一道宽五、六米的裂缝所阻，无法前进。登山队随即返回大本营。
    5月29日，登山队把大本营搬到这个山北面拔海五千一百一十九米的地方，准备由另一条路线突击峰顶。
    6月1日，突击峰顶的战斗开始了。白进孝、丁原宗和刘肇昌、何诲之、艾顺奉、王文章、周聘渭、王洪宝等八人，终于在6月2日北京时间十三点二十分登上了峰顶，获得胜利。
    目前，登山队人员仍留在山区，对积石山进行地质、冰川等方面的科学调查研究工作。
    北京地质学院登山运动开展得很普遍。目前，全校已有97％的学生获得了国家体委颁发的“登山运动员”的等级称号。1958年12月，这个学院的登山队共有五十四名男女运动员登上了甘肃境内拔海五千二百一十五米的祁连山“七一”冰川主峰。去年5月，这个学院的登山队又有四十六人登上了陕西省境内拔海四千一百一十三米的太白山主峰。去年7月，在攀登新疆拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山时，打破女子登山高度世界纪录的九名运动员中，有三名就是这个学院的学生。
