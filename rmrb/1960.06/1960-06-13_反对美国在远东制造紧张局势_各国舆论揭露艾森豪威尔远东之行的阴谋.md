Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Reports from various locations indicate that in commentaries on Eisenhower's Far East trip, North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun," Vietnam's "Nhan Dan," the Soviet Union's "Red Star," and Italy's "L'Unità" pointed out that the American president's "diplomatic trip," aimed at intensifying war preparations, will arouse the righteous anger and anti-American struggle of the Asian people.

    North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" says:
    Eisenhower's visit to the Far East to plot new aggression can only inspire Asian people to strengthen their anti-American struggle.
    Pyongyang "Rodong Sinmun" in its commentary on the 12th, exposed the new aggression schemes of U.S. imperialism, and called on the Korean people and the Asian people to continue to wage a tenacious struggle together to crush any provocative conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism, after sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, is intensifying its arms expansion and war preparations around the world. Currently, the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in the Asian region is surging, and U.S. imperialism is panicking to maintain its position in this region and to carry out new aggression. Eisenhower's "Far East trip" is a link in this frenzied activity of U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary said, "This adventurous 'diplomatic trip' by the notorious war-monger Eisenhower will in no way save the collapsing aggressive system of U.S. imperialism and its dying running dogs, but will only inspire the people to struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs."
    The commentary said, "Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, the vicious culprit of aggression and plunder who has brought countless disasters and suffering to the Asian people, is about to set his blood-stained feet on Asian soil. The Korean people and all Asian people cannot allow this robber chieftain's 'Far East trip'."
    The commentary concluded: "The American aggressors headed by Eisenhower must get out of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and all the regions in Asia where they have stretched their claws. The Korean people and other Asian people will continue to wage a tenacious struggle to crush any provocative conspiracies of U.S. imperialism."

    Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" says:
    U.S. Imperialism's prestige is sweeping away, and anti-American calls will echo throughout Asia.
    Vietnam’s "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on the 11th saying that Eisenhower's trip is to intensify war preparations in order to oppose the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries.
    The commentary also said that the purpose of Eisenhower's trip is also to save the lost prestige of the United States, and to cheer on the Kishi Nobusuke, Heo Jeong, and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, so that they can more actively act as running dogs of the United States and strengthen the suppression of the people.
    The commentary pointed out that the people of the world are fiercely opposing the acts of U.S. imperialism in undermining peace, sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, stubbornly maintaining the "Cold War," and stepping up preparations for war. The commentary pointed out that due to U.S. imperialism's insistence on implementing extremely reactionary policies, it is now more isolated than ever; the United States' prestige in various regions has been swept away.
    The commentary concluded that waiting for Eisenhower will be tomatoes, rotten eggs, and the calls of "Eisenhower get out! U.S. imperialism get out!"

    Soviet Union's "Red Star" says:
    Washington persists in a Cold War policy in Asia, and the Far East public opposes the American President's visit.
    The Soviet Union's "Red Star" published an article on the 12th regarding U.S. President Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Far East, pointing out that it is a "Cold War" wind that is driving Eisenhower to the Far East, the same wind that blew the "U-2" spy plane into the Soviet Union, and sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, and it is this wind that has stirred up tension in Asia and around the world.
    The article pointed out that on the visiting route chosen by Eisenhower, there are the largest U.S. military bases in Asia, a region where U.S. troops are concentrated. It is no accident that the visit plan includes a visit to Okinawa, the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the United States. Even the "New York Times" believes that Eisenhower's Far East trip "has unwelcome militaristic undertones," and "is more of an inspection of U.S. overseas bases than a goodwill visit...".
    "Red Star" emphasized that Washington's actions only prove that they have not learned any lessons from the failures they have suffered, and are still trying to build their policies in Asia on the basis of supporting terrorist regimes and advocating the Cold War. Undoubtedly, for the United States, continuing to pursue this path is fraught with new and unpleasant surprises. The activities of the Far Eastern countries' public opposing Eisenhower's visit convincingly prove this point.

    Italy's "L'Unità" says:
    Eisenhower's trip is a provocation against China, and the United States is trying its best to step up war preparations in the Far East.
    "L'Unità" published an editorial saying that Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Far East is a provocation against China. The newspaper said that the U.S. President's visit to Taipei is a provocation, because Taiwan is Chinese territory, a part of China that is being invaded by the U.S. military. Spies, saboteurs, spy planes, and warships that infiltrate China all depart from this island.
    The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower's visit to Chiang Kai-shek shows that the collapse of Syngman Rhee and Menderes has neither taught the imperialist ruling groups any lessons, nor could it possibly teach them any lessons, because, in the final analysis, these people are the only ones the United States can rely on. "L'Unità" pointed out that the United States is not satisfied with this provocation, and it has also decided to "mobilize" the Seventh Fleet, which possesses nuclear weapons and is a force that is often directed against China, convene a SEATO meeting, and send one hundred and twenty aircraft to the Far East.

    反对美国在远东制造紧张局势
    各国舆论揭露艾森豪威尔远东之行的阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：朝鲜“劳动新闻”、越南“人民报”、苏联“红星报”和意大利“团结报”在就艾森豪威尔远东之行发表评论时指出，美国总统的这次为了加紧备战活动的“外交旅行”，将会激起亚洲人民的正义愤怒和反美斗争。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    艾森豪威尔到远东策划新的侵略  只能激发亚洲人民加强反美斗争
    平壤“劳动新闻”在12日的评论中揭露了美帝国主义新的侵略阴谋，号召朝鲜人民和亚洲人民一起为粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅性阴谋活动继续展开顽强的斗争。
　　评论指出，美帝国主义在破坏了四国首脑会议以后，正在世界各地加剧扩军备战。目前，亚洲地区的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争日益高涨，美帝国主义慌忙地要保持它在这个地区的地位，来进行新的侵略。艾森豪威尔的“远东之行”，就是美帝国主义的这一疯狂活动的一环。
    评论说，“恶名昭彰的战争贩子艾森豪威尔的这次冒险的‘外交旅行’，丝毫不能挽救崩溃中的美帝国主义的侵略体系和它的垂死的走狗，反而只能激发起人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。”
    评论说，“历来给亚洲人民带来了无数灾难和痛苦的恶毒的、侵略和掠夺的元凶美帝国主义的头目艾森豪威尔，要把沾满鲜血的脚踏上亚洲土地了。朝鲜人民和全体亚洲人民不能容许这个强盗头目的‘远东之行’。”
    评论最后说：“以艾森豪威尔为头目的美国侵略者必须从南朝鲜、日本、台湾、南越和它伸出魔掌的亚洲的一切地区滚出去。朝鲜人民和其他亚洲人民将为粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅性阴谋活动继续展开顽强的斗争。”
    越南“人民报”说
    美帝国主义威信扫地  反美呼声将响遍亚洲
    越南“人民报”11日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔这次出行是为了加紧备战活动，以反对苏联、中国和亚洲其他国家。
    评论又说，艾森豪威尔这次出行的目的还在于挽救美国丧失的威信，并给岸信介、许政、蒋介石集团打气，使他们更卖力地充当美国的走狗，加强对人民的镇压。
    评论指出，世界人民正在激烈地反对美帝国主义破坏和平、破坏四国首脑会议、顽固地维持“冷战”和加紧准备战争的行为。评论指出，由于美帝国主义坚持执行极其反动的政策，目前它已比任何时候更加孤立；美国在各个地区的威信已经扫地。
    评论最后说，等待艾森豪威尔的将是蕃茄、臭鸡蛋和“艾森豪威尔滚出去！美帝国主义滚出去！”的呼声。
    苏联“红星报”说
    华盛顿在亚洲坚持冷战政策  远东公众反对美国总统访问
    苏联“红星报”12日就美国总统艾森豪威尔即将到远东访问一事发表文章指出，驱使艾森豪威尔到远东去的正是一股“冷战”之风，这种风把“U—2”型间谍飞机刮进苏联，并且破坏了四国首脑会议，也正是这种风煽起了亚洲和全世界的紧张局势。
    文章指出，在艾森豪威尔选择的这条访问路线上，设有美国在亚洲最大的军事基地，这是美国军队集中的地区。在访问计划中包括对美国的“永不沉没的航空母舰”——冲绳岛的访问，这不是偶然的。甚至“纽约时报”也认为，艾森豪威尔的远东之行“具有不受欢迎的军国主义色彩”，“与其说是亲善访问，倒不如说是对美国国外基地的视察……”。
    “红星报”强调指出，华盛顿的这种行动只是证明了他们没有从已经遭到的失败中吸取任何教训，仍然企图把自己在亚洲的政策建立在支持恐怖制度和鼓吹冷战的基础上。无疑地，对于美国来说，继续奉行这种路线孕育着新的、令人不愉快的意外事件。远东国家公众反对艾森豪威尔访问的活动令人信服地证明了这一点。
    意大利“团结报”说
    艾森豪威尔之行是对中国挑衅  美国竭力在远东加紧备战活动
    “团结报”发表社论说，艾森豪威尔即将到远东进行的访问是对中国的挑衅。这家报纸说，美国总统将访问台北，是一个挑衅，因为台湾是中国的国土、是受美国军队侵略的中国的一部分。渗入中国的间谍、破坏者、特务飞机和军舰都是从这个岛上出发的。
    报纸指出，艾森豪威尔访问蒋介石说明，李承晚和曼德列斯的垮台既没有使帝国主义统治集团获得任何教训，也不可能使他们获得任何教训，因为归根结蒂说这些人是美国唯一能够倚靠的人。“团结报”指出，美国还不以这种挑衅为满足，它还决定“动员”拥有原子武器的第七舰队这个经常针对中国的武力，召开了东南亚条约组织会议，并且还派一百二十架飞机去远东。
