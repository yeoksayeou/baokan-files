Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 14th: The Central Committee of the Indonesian Railway Workers' Union recently sent a telegram to the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, stating that Indonesian railway workers are closely watching and supporting the heroic struggle of Japanese workers and the Japanese people to overthrow the Kishi government, oppose the ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and reject Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The Indonesian Railway Workers' Union expressed its firm belief that this struggle will be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 10th: Indonesia's largest farmers' organization, the Indonesian Peasants' Front, issued a statement on the 9th, representing its four million members, expressing full support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's military collusion with the United States.

The statement said that the new military treaty signed between the undemocratic Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government is to further strengthen the U.S. military occupation of Japan. This treaty means that U.S. imperialism is further interfering in Japan's internal affairs and turning Japan into a U.S. military base and nuclear base.

The statement pointed out that Indonesian farmers have suffered from U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. At the same time, the United States still stands on the side of the Netherlands on the West Irian issue. The statement called on Indonesian farmers and people from all walks of life to resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for democracy and against U.S. interference.

    支持日本人民反美反岸正义斗争
    新华社雅加达14日电 印度尼西亚铁路工人工会中央委员会最近打电报给日本国营铁道工会说，印度尼西亚铁路工人正在密切注视和支持日本工人和日本人民为推翻岸政府、反对批准日美“安全条约”和拒绝艾森豪威尔访问日本而进行的英勇斗争。印度尼西亚铁路工人工会表示深信，这个斗争一定会获得胜利。
    新华社雅加达10日电 印度尼西亚最大的农民组织印度尼西亚农民阵线9日发表声明，代表它的四百万成员表示充分支持日本人民反对岸信介政府同美国进行军事勾结的斗争。
    声明说，不民主的岸信介政府和美国政府之间签订的新军事条约，是为了进一步加强美国对日本的军事占领。这个条约意味着美帝国主义进一步干涉日本的内政和把日本变成一个美国的军事基地和核基地。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚农民曾经遭受美国干涉印度尼西亚内政之苦，同时，在西伊里安问题上，美国仍旧站在荷兰方面。声明要求印度尼西亚农民和其他各界人民，坚决支持日本人民争取民主和反对美国干涉的英勇斗争。
