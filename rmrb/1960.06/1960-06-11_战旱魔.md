    Combatting the Drought Demon
    Ma Bingshu, Head of the Nanshuiquan Production Brigade, Huai'lai County, Garden Commune, Hebei Province.
    Drought demon, drought demon, the people hate you more than anything, individual farming can't handle you, letting you torment the blossoming flowers and green crops. Drought demon, drought demon, today we have the People's Commune, lake water is brought up the mountainside, the grain piles will be more numerous than the stars.
    Spring thunder warriors bring spring thunder, driving iron dragons and singing battle songs, the warriors bring spring water, the army and people cooperate to extinguish the drought demon. Soldiers shed beads of sweat, every drop of sweat turns into joyful rain, legend tells of Erlang carrying mountains, now the anti-drought army is linked together to form a canal.
    Ensuring a bumper year, the Municipal Party Secretary sows seeds, delighting commune members who all praise him, praising the military officers for carrying water, praising Secretary Hu for planting the fields. Not afraid that the sky is high and brings no rain, the Garden Commune is sure to have a bumper year!

    春雷战士带来春雷，驾起铁龙唱着战歌，战士提来泉水，军民合作扑灭旱魔。军人流下汗珠，滴滴汗水变成喜雨，传说二郎担山，而今抗旱大军连成运河。
    确保丰收年市委书记撒籽种，喜得社员都赞美，称赞军官来担水，称赞胡书记来种田。不怕天高不下雨，花园确保丰收年！
