Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said at a rally of democratic parties and non-party democrats against American imperialism’s aggression on the 18th, that Eisenhower, the head of American imperialism's aggression, came to the Far East this time to plot military aggression deployments, and even dared to sneak into Taiwan, our country's territory, to carry out conspiratorial activities and interfere in our internal affairs. This is a direct provocation to the 650 million Chinese people and must be given a relentless blow!

He said that American imperialism's provocation against the Soviet Union with spy planes was defeated, and Eisenhower's crime of sabotaging the four-power summit was condemned by the people of the world. After the "peaceful" cloak of this imperialist aggressor was completely torn off, he still insisted on coming to the Far East to plot new war conspiracies, despite the strong opposition of the people of Asia. This matter itself powerfully illustrates that the aggressive nature of American imperialism will not and cannot be changed. We must not have any illusions about American imperialism. American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world. Only by uniting the people of all countries in the world, forming the broadest anti-imperialist united front, and waging the most resolute struggle against American imperialism, isolating American imperialism to the greatest extent, can it be possible to prevent it from acting rashly and maintain world peace.

He said that Eisenhower, the head of American imperialism's aggression, created a murderous atmosphere in the Far East region, deploying troops and generals everywhere, conducting military exercises, strengthening the armaments of aggressive bases, and intensifying the activities of military blocs, attempting to intimidate the people of Asian countries and make them obey the dictates of the imperialist aggressors. But imperialists and reactionaries often underestimate the power of the people. As the saying goes in our country, "One will not give up until one reaches the Yellow River." Before Eisenhower departed from the United States, he always tried to portray the Japanese people's angry protests and courageous struggles as being carried out by a "minority" and not worth paying attention to. Only when he approached the territory of Japan did he finally feel the weight of this anger and struggle, and finally had to announce a "postponement" of his visit to Japan. In the face of the tremendous power of the people, the paper tiger once again revealed its true colors.

Wang Shao'ao said that the "June 15th" massacre perpetrated by the Nobusuke Kishi clique, the running dogs of American imperialism, has further aroused the righteous indignation of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries and their determination to oppose American imperialism. Eisenhower's agenda for engaging in aggressive conspiracies in the Far East has been disrupted, which is a preliminary victory for the Japanese people. But the matter is by no means over. The continued resolute struggle of the Asian people will undoubtedly completely disrupt the timetable of American imperialism's entire aggression plan and war plan. This fact also shows that the power of the people is greater than the aggressive power of imperialism. As long as the people unite and strengthen their struggle, the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism can be defeated. Eisenhower came to the Far East this time and served as a good teacher by negative example. The Asian people greatly ridiculed him, and at the same time, they recorded this "merit" of his in their ridicule.

Wang Shao'ao finally said, I, on behalf of all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, fully agree with and support the People's Liberation Army's anti-American armed demonstration on the Jinmen front. Eisenhower is a "plague god." To deal with the "plague god," we should use artillery fire. American imperialism is an enemy of the Chinese people everywhere, but the powerful Chinese people cannot be deceived. We have given American imperialism many lessons in the past, and we will give it even greater lessons in the future. American imperialism's armed occupation of Taiwan, our country's territory, its interference in our internal affairs, and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" are a serious provocation to the 650 million united and powerful Chinese people, which the Chinese people who have stood up will never allow. Taiwan is an inalienable part of our country's territory. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair and will not tolerate any form of interference from American imperialism.

We must liberate Taiwan, we must drive American imperialism out of Taiwan, out of South Korea, out of Japan, out of Asia, and out of the Western Pacific!

### 中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊讲话  对付“瘟神”应当用万炮齐轰

    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊讲话
    对付“瘟神”应当用万炮齐轰
    新华社19日讯　中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊18日在各民主党派和无党派民主人士反对美帝国主义侵略的抗议集会上说，美帝国主义的侵略头子艾森豪威尔这次到远东来策划军事侵略部署，还胆敢窜入我国的领土台湾进行阴谋活动，干涉我国内政，这是对六亿五千万中国人民的直接挑衅，必须给以无情打击！
    他说，美帝国主义用间谍飞机向苏联挑衅被击败，艾森豪威尔破坏四国首脑会议的罪行受到全世界人民的谴责，这个帝国主义侵略头子的“和平”外衣被完全撕破之后，还是不顾亚洲人民的强烈反对，坚持要到远东来策划新战争阴谋。这件事情本身就有力地说明，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的，也是不能改变的。我们对美帝国主义决不可有任何幻想。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，只有团结世界各国人民，结成最广大的反帝统一战线，对美帝国主义进行最坚决的斗争，把美帝国主义最大限度地孤立起来，才有可能使它不敢轻举妄动，才能维护世界和平。
    他说，艾森豪威尔这个美帝国主义的侵略头子这次出来活动，首先在远东地区制造了杀气腾腾的气氛，到处调兵遣将，搞军事演习，加强侵略基地的武装，加紧军事集团的活动，企图恐吓亚洲各国的人民，使他们听候帝国主义侵略者的摆布。但是帝国主义和反动派常常是错误地低估了人民的力量。我国的谚语说得好，“不到黄河心不死”。艾森豪威尔从美国出发前，总想把日本人民的愤怒抗议和勇敢斗争说成是“少数人”搞的，不值得重视。只有到他临近日本的国土，才终于感觉到这种愤怒和斗争的分量，终于不得不宣布“延期”到日本去。在人民的巨大力量面前，纸老虎又一次露了原形。
    王绍鏊说，美帝国主义走狗岸信介集团制造的“六·一五”大屠杀，更加激起了日本人民和亚洲各国人民的义愤和反对美帝国主义的斗争决心。艾森豪威尔来远东搞侵略阴谋的日程已经被打乱了，这是日本人民的初步胜利。但事情决不是到此为止。亚洲人民继续进行的坚决斗争，毫无疑问地将要彻底打乱美帝国主义整个侵略计划和战争计划的日程表。这一事实也说明，人民的力量大于帝国主义侵略力量，只要人民团结起来，加强斗争，帝国主义的侵略阴谋是可以被打垮的。艾森豪威尔这次到远东来当了一个很好的反面教员，亚洲人民大大地嘲笑了他，同时也在嘲笑中记下了他这一笔“功劳”。
    王绍鏊最后说，我代表中国民主促进会全体成员完全赞成并且支持人民解放军在金门前线举行的反美武装示威。艾森豪威尔是一个“瘟神”。对付“瘟神”应当用炮轰。美帝国主义处处以中国人民为敌，但是强大的中国人民是不可欺侮的。我们过去已给了美帝国主义不少教训，今后还将给它更大的教训。美帝国主义武装占据我国领土台湾，干涉我国内政，阴谋制造“两个中国”，是对六亿五千万团结一致的强大的中国人民的严重挑衅，这是站起来了的中国人民决不能容许的。台湾是我国不可分割的领土的一部分，解放台湾是我国的内政，决不容美帝国主义任何方式的干涉。
    我们一定要解放台湾，一定要把美帝国主义从台湾驱逐出去，从南朝鲜驱逐出去，从日本驱逐出去，从亚洲驱逐出去，从西太平洋驱逐出去！
