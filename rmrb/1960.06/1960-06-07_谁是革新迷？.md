Who is the Innovation Fanatic?
	Yan Boming
Yesterday, I heard that the Third Branch had produced an innovation fanatic who had created forty-eight new things in a few days, and some of them had reached a very high level. In order to quickly report this matter, the factory newspaper sent me to interview him. I used to work in this factory, so I went straight into the workshop. As soon as I entered, I ran into Master Li, who I used to apprentice under. He was wearing his reading glasses and drawing lines on the technical innovation chart. I walked behind Master Li and saw that the innovation projects under Master Li's name on the chart were exactly at forty-eight. I couldn't help but be happy, thinking: I never expected that the person I was going to interview today was actually my master! Truly, "you can't judge a book by its cover." Last year when I was apprenticing with him, Master Li was incredibly superstitious and conservative! As soon as someone mentioned technical innovation, he would always wave his hand and shake his head, shouting: "No way, no way! We're just roughnecks, technical reform is for engineers. We, ah, should just work hard!" Later, we developed a multi-edge cutting method behind his back, which immediately increased work efficiency fourfold. We thought he would definitely be convinced, but unexpectedly, he said we were just lucky. Now, he has innovated forty-eight things in a few days, which is really surprising and delightful. Just as I was thinking this, he suddenly turned his head, saw me standing behind him, and said with a smile: "What's up, Little Wang, here to write another article?" I went over and shook his hand, saying: "Congratulations, Master Li, you've come up with so many things in just a few days..." Before I knew it, my junior apprentice also ran over, interrupting me, saying: "Master Li has become obsessed with innovation. He innovates at work, innovates after work, doesn't bother to eat, doesn't bother to sleep, modifying machines and making new products." I said: "I heard about it a long time ago, that's why I came here to interview Master Li." The junior apprentice jumped up happily and shouted: "It'll be in the newspaper tomorrow." Master Li didn't smile, but patted me on the shoulder and said: "Little Wang, your master isn't qualified enough, he's still far from being able to compare with Master Wang." I thought Master Li was being modest, so I changed the subject, wanting to learn about the situation from the side. Guess what Master Li did? He glared and said: "You're not interviewing good material, what are you doing hanging around here!" I know Master Li's temper, his eyes already indicate everything. If I tried to ask any further, he would shut up and ignore me. There was no way, I had to turn around and leave. After walking a long way, I looked back and saw Master Li smiling at me, while the junior apprentice was pouting, probably complaining that I left without digging out Master Li's story.

I walked through rows of lathes and walked to Master Wang. Master Wang was surrounded by people, he was standing in the middle explaining something to others! I stepped forward, grabbed Master Wang's hand, and explained my purpose. Master Wang said with a smile: "I don't have any achievements, I just modified the machine a bit, the others are just small things, not worth mentioning." Saying this, he pointed with his hand and said: "If you want to write an article, go find Little Liu, that kid has converted five machine tools to automation." I followed his hand and saw that no one was on duty in front of the five machine tools, only Little Liu was sitting there drinking water. In the past, not to mention one person, even five people would be sweating profusely. This attracted me, so I ran over like a shot, just about to talk to him, when suddenly I heard a young man shouting in the east: "Come and see, Master Zhou has successfully tested the modified rotary tool, increasing work efficiency by twenty-five times!" Everyone ran over when they heard this, even Little Liu ran over, so I had no choice but to follow. Suddenly, one of my senior brothers saw me and shouted at me: "Little Wang! You've come at the right time, quickly write an article about Little Zhou!" Everyone said "good" and dragged me to Little Zhou. Little Zhou blushed and waved his hands at everyone, saying: "Hey, hey, everyone is praising me too much, I can't take it. This matter isn't worth putting in the newspaper! Master Feng's use of drilling and milling simultaneously to increase work efficiency by 102 times isn't better than mine?" Master Feng chimed in from the crowd, saying: "Me, hehe, although I increased work efficiency by 102 times, the reform projects are still too few. Little Du not only reformed fifty items himself, but also helped others reform twenty items. I think this innovation fanatic is worth writing about..." A dark-faced, large young man emerged from the crowd and said to everyone: "If you're talking about innovation fanatics, I think you have to count Master Zheng, although he has fewer projects than me, the number of projects that have reached world-class levels is much more than mine!"

I listened to them talking and arguing with each other, and my head was a little dizzy. Among them, who exactly is the innovation fanatic I'm looking for? I turned around, wanting to find their director to understand the situation, and ran into Party Committee Secretary Wang. I explained my intention to him, and he laughed: "Things are changing all the time right now, there are too many innovation fanatics you're looking for." I knew that my original plan couldn't be realized, and quickly said: "Find the one with the most outstanding achievements right now." "If you ask me to say who is the most outstanding right now, I can't say for sure for the moment. Let's go to the workshop first."

Accompanied by the symphony of motors and gears, the two of us walked through the workshop, looking at all kinds of lathes, looking at the smiling faces of people working selflessly, looking at the red arrows on the large and small production charts constantly rising, my heart could not calm down. Yes, there are too many people to write about. Who exactly is the innovation fanatic?

    谁是革新迷？
    阎伯明
    昨天，听说三分场出了一位革新迷，几天工夫创造出四十八件新东西，而且有些东西达到了很高的水平。厂报为了迅速把这件事报道出去，派我去访问他。我原先在这个厂工作过，就一直走进了车间。一进门，正好碰上我曾经跟着学过徒的李师傅，他戴着一副老花眼镜正在技术革新图表上划道道。我走到李师傅身后一看，图表上李师傅名下的革新项目正好划到四十八。我不由得高兴起来，心想：真没想到，今天我所要访问的原来是我师傅呀！真是“人不可貌相”。去年我跟他学徒的时候，李师傅那迷信、保守劲儿就甭提啦！只要有人一提技术革新，他总是摆着手，摇着头喊：“不行，不行！咱是大老粗，技术改革那是工程师的事，咱呐，好好干活吧！”后来，我们背着他搞了个多刃切削法，一下提高工效四倍，心想他一定得服气了，出乎意料的是，他说我们是侥幸。如今，他几天工夫革新出四十八件东西，真是叫人又惊又喜。正想着，他猛回头，看我站在他身后，笑着说：“怎么着小王，又来写文章了？”我过去握着他的手说：“祝贺你，李师傅，几天工夫就搞出这么多东西来呀……”不知什么时候小师弟也跑过来，打断我的话说：“李师傅革新都成了迷啦。他是上班也革，下班也革，饭也顾不上吃，觉也顾不上睡，又改机器，又制作新产品。”我说：“我早听说了，今天就是特地来访问李师傅的。”小师弟高兴得跳起来喊着：“明儿个就得登报了。”李师傅没有笑，拍了我一下肩膀说：“小王，你师傅还不够资格，要和老王师傅比还差的远哩。”我以为李师傅谦虚，忙岔开话题，想侧面了解一下情况。你猜李师傅怎么着，把两眼一瞪：“放着好材料你不去访，你在我这儿泡什么蘑菇！”李师傅的脾气我是晓得的，他那两只眼睛已经表明了一切，如果再想追问下去，他就会一言不发，不再理你。没法子，只好转身走了。走了好远，回头一看，李师傅笑着望着我，而小师弟却噘着嘴生气，大概是怨我没把李师傅的事挖出来就走了。
    我穿过一排排车床，走到王师傅跟前，王师傅被人围得风雨不透，他站在中间正给别人讲些什么呢！我上前拉着王师傅的手说明了来意。王师傅笑着说：“我没什么成绩，只是把机器改装了一下，其他的都是小玩意，不值得一提。”说到这，他用手一指说：“你要写文章去找小刘，那小子把五台机床都改成自动化了。”我顺着他的手一看，五台机床前真没人值班，只有小刘一个坐在那里喝水。要是过去，别说他一个人，就是五个人也忙得汗流满面呢。这事可吸引了我，便飞也似地跑了过去，刚要跟他讲话，突然听到一个小伙子在东头喊：“快来看呀，周师傅改装旋活，试验成功了，提高工效二十五倍！”大家一听都跑了过去，连小刘也跑了过去，我也只好跟上去。突然我的一位师兄看见了我，向我喊：“小王！你来的正好，快给小周写篇文章吧！”大家说声“好”便把我拖到小周面前。小周红着脸向大家摆着手说：“嗳嗳，大家这样抬我，我可受不了。这个事儿还不值得登报！人家冯师傅采用钻铣双管齐下提高工效一百零二倍不比我这强？”冯师傅在人群里搭腔说：“我，嘿嘿，虽然提高工效一百零二倍，可是改革的项目还太少了点，小杜人家不但自己改革了五十件，还帮助别人改革了二十件，我看这个革新迷倒值得登一登……。”一个黑脸膛大个子的小伙子，从人群钻出来对大家说：“要说革新迷，我看得数着老郑师傅，他项目虽然比我少，可达到世界水平的比我多的多呀”！
    我听着他们相互之间讲着、吵着，头脑都有点晕了，他们这里边，究竟谁是我所要访问的革新迷呢？我转身想找他们的主任了解了解，正好碰上党委会王书记，我向他说明了来意，他笑起来：“这个时候是一时一变，你要找的革新迷太多了。”我知道我原来的计划不能实现了，忙说：“找个现在成绩最突出的吧。”“现在让我马上说谁最突出，我一时也说不上来，咱们先到车间走走吧。”
    伴着马达和齿轮合奏出来的交响曲，我俩在车间走着，看着各式各样的车床，看着正忘我劳动的欢笑的人们，看着大大小小的生产图表上的红箭头不断上升，我的心始终不能平静下来。是的，要写的人太多了，究竟谁是革新迷呢？
