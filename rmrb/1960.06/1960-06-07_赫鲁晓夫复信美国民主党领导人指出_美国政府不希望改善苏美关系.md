Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 4th: TASS reported that on May 30th, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, wrote to the leaders of the US Democratic Party, Rayburn, Johnson, Stevenson, and Fulbright, in response to a letter they handed to him on May 19th, while the head of the Soviet government was staying in Paris. In that letter, they asked the US President to convey to Khrushchev the Democratic Party's view, namely, that they hoped the Soviet Union would reconsider its suggestion to postpone the summit conference until after the US elections.

In his reply, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union had made every effort for the convocation and success of the summit conference and had prepared constructive proposals. However, the US government's series of measures aimed at escalating international tensions and intensifying the "Cold War" undermined the conference.

Khrushchev said that not everything depends on the Soviet Union; much will depend on the United States and its government. The current US government does not desire an improvement in US-Soviet relations.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that all steps taken by the US side aimed at improving relations between the US and the Soviet Union, maintaining peace and international security, would be met with sympathy and support from the Soviet Union.

    赫鲁晓夫复信美国民主党领导人指出
    美国政府不希望改善苏美关系
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5月30日写信给美国民主党领导人雷朋、约翰逊、史蒂文森和富布赖特，答复他们在5月19日苏联政府首脑逗留巴黎期间转交给他的、他们给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信，他们在那封信里要美国总统向赫鲁晓夫转达民主党人的观点，即希望苏联重新考虑关于把最高级会议推迟到美国大选结束时召开的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中说，苏联为最高级会议的召开和它的成功，曾经尽了一切努力，并且准备了建设性的建议。但是，美国政府采取的一连串目的在于加剧国际紧张局势和加紧“冷战”的措施破坏了会议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，并不是一切都取决于苏联，许多方面将取决于美国和它的政府。现在的美国政府希望的不是改善美苏两国的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，美国方面旨在改善美苏两国间的关系、保持和平和国际安全的所有步骤都会受到苏联的同情和支持。
