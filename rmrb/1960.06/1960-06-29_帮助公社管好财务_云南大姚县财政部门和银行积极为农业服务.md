Helping Communes Manage Finances Well
Yunnan Dayao County Finance Departments and Banks Actively Serve Agriculture

(Our dispatch) The finance and banking departments of Dayao County, Yunnan Province, have assisted people's communes in establishing and improving a relatively complete set of financial management systems and implementing democratic management, promoting production development and the consolidation of people's communes.

The Dayao County Party Committee, based on the instructions of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, decided to unify the financial affairs of the communes under the management of the finance department, and determined that the finance and banking departments should mainly focus on three aspects: first, establish accounts and financial accounting systems in conjunction with the rectification of communes; second, take stock of the communes' assets; and third, train commune financial cadres. According to the county party committee's decision, in order to gain experience, the finance and banking departments organized a work team to first go to Longjie Commune and conduct a pilot project in conjunction with rural rectification, production, and distribution work, and then promoted the experience of the pilot project, so that helping communes and teams to vigorously develop finance became a mass movement.

The finance and banking departments of Dayao County helped communes, management districts, and production teams establish necessary account books as needed, as well as necessary systems for planning management, property management, and cash management, stipulating that the use of funds must be carried out in accordance with the financial revenue and expenditure plan, and approved according to the approved authority. On this basis, accounting is classified according to agriculture, industry, sideline occupations, animal husbandry, capital construction, and administrative management. The characteristics of these accounts and systems are: simple and easy to implement, easy to understand, clear and concise, and can timely and comprehensively reflect the production and living conditions of the commune, thus conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, promoting the development of production and collective welfare undertakings, and further implementing the policy of running communes diligently and thriftily. For example, the Hebian Production Team of Yongfu Commune earned 153 yuan from selling pigs in the first quarter of this year. It was planned to use this money to buy a gramophone, but it was not approved, so they bought farm tools and invested them in production.

Because the accounts and systems are relatively sound, the information obtained through financial activity analysis can be used to discover problems in a timely manner and take measures to resolve contradictions. For example, the conditions of the Baichong Team and Yangjiawan First Team of the Jiangjun Management District of Cangjie Commune are about the same. When the financial cadres analyzed the financial revenue and expenditure of each production team in January, they found that the sideline income of these two teams differed greatly, with Baichong Team having 650 yuan and Yangjiawan First Team only 31 yuan. The reason for this was that Baichong Team was good at utilizing after-work hours, properly arranging labor, and especially good at tapping labor potential and vigorously developing sideline production; while Yangjiawan First Team did poorly in these aspects. The financial cadres reported this situation to the general branch of the management district, and Zhang Zhongying, the secretary of the general branch, attached great importance to it, convened a production team leader meeting for discussion, and promoted the experience of Baichong Team. Currently, Yangjiawan First Team has caught up with Baichong Team. Through the establishment of accounts and systems and the strengthening of economic accounting, all production units have universally established the idea of careful calculation and management of finances. Among the 361 industrial and sideline production units of the county's communes, 91 were losing money before the establishment of accounts and systems, and now 88 of them have become profitable. At the same time, it has also played a positive role in doing a good job in commune distribution.

The finance and banking departments of Dayao County, relying on the masses, have created many democratic management forms that serve production and life and are popular with the masses, and have achieved good results. For example, they helped the commune establish ten publicity platforms for publicizing financial revenues and expenditures, labor attendance, labor work points, cafeteria food accounts, the results of the "Five Good Members" competition, as well as grain usage and inventory, "Fifteen Raising" (raising pigs, sheep, cattle, horses, rabbits, chickens, ducks, etc.) production plans, industrial and sideline production plans, production progress, and property inventory, so that commune members can know the production arrangements and their labor results as early as possible, which is convenient for commune members to supervise financial management and urge accountants to clarify accounts in a timely manner, so that financial work can promote production development and promote labor emulation. These publicity platforms are deeply welcomed by the broad masses, truly achieving "leaders disclosing the bottom line to the masses, accountants handing over accounts to the masses, and the masses entrusting their hearts to the Party," greatly mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the masses. Commune members have widely launched the "three comparisons" competition of comparing early attendance, full attendance, and high work efficiency, and the attendance rate has increased from 85% in the past to 95%, and labor productivity has been greatly improved.

Under the leadership of the Party committee, the finance and banking departments also adopted various forms to train financial personnel. In addition to sending them to schools for study, holding meetings for training, observation and inspection, on-site visits for skill demonstrations, and carrying out financial comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and competition activities, they also opened "Financial Accounting Night Schools" to continuously improve the political and professional level of financial cadres so that financial accounting work can better serve the central work.

    帮助公社管好财务
    云南大姚县财政部门和银行积极为农业服务
    本报讯　云南省大姚县财政、银行部门，帮助人民公社建立和健全了一套比较完整的财务管理制度，实行民主管理，促进了生产发展和人民公社的巩固。
    中共大姚县委根据中共云南省委的指示，决定把公社的财务统一交给财政部门管理，并决定财政、银行部门主要抓住三条：一、结合整社建立账目和财务会计制度；二、摸清公社家底；三、培养公社财务干部。根据县委的决定，为了取得经验，财政、银行部门组织工作组先到龙街公社，结合农村整社、生产、分配工作进行了试点，然后推广试点的经验，使帮助社、队大搞财务形成群众性的运动。
    大姚县的财政、银行部门帮助公社、管理区、生产队，根据需要建立了必要的账簿，以及计划管理、财产管理、现金管理等必要的制度，规定了运用资金必须按财务收支计划进行，按批准权限审批。在这个基础上，按农业、工业、副业、畜牧业、基本建设、行政管理等分类核算。这些账目和制度的特点是：简便易行，通俗易懂，眉目清楚，能及时、全面地反映公社生产、生活情况，因而有利于调动群众的积极性，促进生产和集体福利事业的发展，进一步贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。例如，永富公社河边生产队今年第一季度卖猪收入一百五十三元，准备用这笔钱买留声机，没被批准，便买了农具投入生产。
    由于账目和制度比较健全，通过财务活动分析和掌握的资料，可以及时发现问题，采取措施解决矛盾。例如，仓街公社将军管理区白冲队和杨家湾一队各方面的条件差不多，财务干部分析1月份各生产队财务收支时，发现这两个队副业收入相距很大，白冲队为六百五十元，杨家湾一队仅三十一元。追究原因是白冲队善于利用工余时间，妥善安排劳动力，特别是善于挖掘劳动潜力，大搞副业生产；而杨家湾一队恰恰在这些方面做得比较差。财务干部向管理区总支汇报了这一情况，总支书记张仲英非常重视，召开生产队长会议进行讨论，推广白冲队的经验，目前杨家湾一队已经赶上了白冲队。通过建立账目和制度以及加强经济核算，各生产单位普遍树立了精打细算，当家理财的思想。全县公社的三百六十一个工业、副业生产单位，在建账建制以前，亏损的有九十一个，现在其中已有八十八个变为盈余。同时，对搞好公社分配也起了积极作用。
    大姚县财政、银行部门依靠群众，创造了许多为生产和生活服务的、群众喜闻乐见的民主管理形式，收到了良好的效果。例如，他们帮助公社建立了公布财务收支、劳动出勤、劳动工分、食堂伙食账目、五好社员评比结果，以及粮食使用库存、“十五养”（养猪、羊、牛、马、兔、鸡、鸭等）生产规划、工业副业生产规划、生产进度、财产清理的十个公布台，使社员能及早知道生产安排和自己的劳动成果，便于社员监督财务管理和督促会计及时搞清账目等，使财务工作能够促进生产发展和推动劳动竞赛。这些公布台深受广大群众欢迎，真正做到了“领导向群众交底，会计向群众交账，群众向党交心”，大大调动了群众的生产积极性。社员们广泛开展了比出勤早、出勤齐、工效高的“三比”竞赛，出勤率由过去的85％提高到95％，劳动生产率大大提高。
    财政、银行部门在党委领导下，还采取多种多样的形式培养和训练财务人员，除了送学校学习，开会训练，观摩检查，现场参观比武，开展财务比、学、赶、帮竞赛等以外，还开办了“财务会计夜校”。以不断提高财务干部的政治业务水平，使财务会计工作更好地为中心工作服务。
