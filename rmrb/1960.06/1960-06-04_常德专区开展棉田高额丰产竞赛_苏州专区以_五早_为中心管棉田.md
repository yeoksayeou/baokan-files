Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, has launched a high-yield cotton production competition movement centered on vigorous cotton field management, greatly promoting cotton field management work. At present, the prefecture's 1.1 million mu of cotton fields have generally undergone one round of cultivation, weeding, thinning, topdressing, and spraying. The cotton seedlings are generally growing well, with a height of generally four inches or more; a few cotton seedlings are as high as two feet or more and have begun to bud and bloom.

The experience of the past few years has proven that vigorously promoting command fields and carrying out mass-based high-yield competitions are effective measures to promote cotton field production and achieve high yields. This year, all cotton-producing areas in Changde Prefecture have generally applied this experience, adopting the method of leaders taking the lead, vigorously promoting command fields, everyone taking the lead, and vigorously promoting high-yield fields, to drive the increase in production of general large fields. County and commune cadres and members in various cotton-producing areas have jointly established 25,000 mu of command fields and more than 575,000 mu of high-yield fields. High-yield cotton fields account for more than 50% of the total cotton field area, including high-yield plots of ten mu, hundreds of mu, thousands of mu, and even tens of thousands of mu, as well as more than 1.3 million "high-yield plants," forming a high-yield competition network throughout the prefecture.

Due to the vigorous promotion of command fields, cotton production in the prefecture has seen a leap-forward situation of "one flag flying high, ten thousand flags fluttering, one advanced place surpassing ten thousand places." Some counties have also used command fields as benchmarks to carry out a competition of "five catching up" (late sowing catching up with early sowing, intercropping catching up with general fields, general fields catching up with high-yield fields, high-yield fields catching up with command fields, low-yield fields catching up with high-yield fields) and "five comparisons" (comparing seedling uniformity, seedling strength, seedling evenness, seedling greenness, and pest and disease control).

Vigorously strengthening technical guidance for cotton planting is an important measure to ensure the capture of high yields of cotton. Cotton scientific research institutes have been generally established in all cotton-producing areas of the prefecture, with communes as units, and cotton technology research organizations have been established at the levels of brigades, production teams, and work groups, forming a technology research and promotion network. Throughout the prefecture, more than 83,000 technicians have been trained through short-term training, on-site visits, and experienced workers guiding new workers, averaging one technician for every eight mu of cotton land.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram: Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, is actively carrying out cotton seedling management work centered on the "Five Earlies," striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year. The "Five Earlies" are: early thinning and replanting, early repair of drainage ditches, early prevention and control of pests and diseases, early application of seedling fertilizer, and early cultivation and weeding. At present, more than half of the direct-seeded cotton fields in the prefecture have completed the first processing, achieving no missing plants, no pests and diseases, no drought or waterlogging, no weeds, and no soil crusting.

In order to achieve high cotton yields, all areas appropriately sowed earlier this year, and the prefecture completed cotton field sowing in mid-April, five to seven days earlier than in previous years. The sowing quality was very good. Nutritional pots for seedling cultivation have been widely promoted in various areas to solve the contradiction of cotton-wheat double cropping, and 35% of the cotton fields in the prefecture are transplanted with seedlings. After the cotton seedlings were transplanted, all areas resolutely implemented the spirit of managing from the beginning and managing as soon as they were planted. Based on the characteristics of early sowing this year, recent changeable climate, and more rainfall, they organized forces to conduct a major inspection in the fields after the end of sowing.

In order to strengthen leadership, all areas implemented specialized management and promoted a management responsibility system. Communes and teams in concentrated cotton-producing areas took doing a good job in cotton production as the central task of the entire party and the entire people, with the first secretary of the party committee taking command and going all out. Grain-cotton intercropping areas have a secretary in charge, establishing professional teams to take full responsibility. In view of the past during the summer harvest and planting period, agricultural work was intense, food crops had to be harvested and planted, and cotton cultivation was a critical juncture, all areas paid special attention to the arrangement of labor, ensuring that superior forces were invested in the summer harvest and planting, while also arranging a certain amount of labor to do a good job in cotton field seedling management, promoting early cotton seedling development, bringing peaches into the hot season, early maturity, and increased production.

### 常德专区开展棉田高额丰产竞赛  苏州专区以“五早”为中心管棉田

    常德专区开展棉田高额丰产竞赛
    苏州专区以“五早”为中心管棉田
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省常德专区开展以大搞棉花田间管理为中心内容的高额丰产竞赛运动，大大推动了棉田管理工作。目前，全区一百一十万亩棉花普遍进行了一次中耕、除草、间苗、追肥、打药，棉苗普遍生长良好，苗高一般达四寸以上；少数棉苗高达二尺以上，并开始现蕾、开花。
    几年来的经验证明，大搞指挥田，开展群众性的高额丰产竞赛运动是推动棉田生产，夺取高额丰产的有效措施。今年常德专区各个棉区普遍运用了这条经验，采取领导上阵，大搞指挥田，人人上阵，大搞丰产田的办法，带动一般大田增产。各地棉区县、社干部与社员一道共建立了二万五千亩指挥田和五十七万五千多亩高额丰产田。丰产棉田占整个棉田面积的50％以上，其中有十亩、百亩、千亩以至万亩以上的丰产片，还有一百三十多万株“丰产株”，在全区组成了丰产竞赛网。
    由于大搞指挥田，全区棉花生产出现了“一旗高举万旗飘，一处先进万处超”的跃进局面。有的县还以指挥田为标兵，开展了“五赶”（迟播赶早播，套种赶一般田，一般田赶丰产田，丰产田赶指挥田，低产田赶高产田）、五比（比苗齐、苗壮、苗匀、苗青、防治病虫）的竞赛。
    大力加强植棉的技术指导，是保证夺取棉花高额丰产的重要措施。全区各产棉区普遍以公社为单位建立了棉花科学研究所，大队、生产队、作业组层层建立了棉花技术研究组织，形成技术研究推广网。全区通过短期训练、现场参观、老手带新手等方法共训练了八万三千多名技术员，平均每八亩棉地就有一个技术员。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省苏州专区积极开展以“五早”为中心的棉花苗期管理工作，力争今年棉花大丰收。“五早”是：早间苗补苗，早整修水沟，早防治病虫，早施苗肥，早中耕除草。目前，全区半数以上的直播棉田已结束第一次加工，实现了无缺棵、无病虫、无旱涝、无杂草、无板结。
    为了棉花高产，今年各地都适当早播，全区在4月中旬就结束棉田播种，比往年提早五至七天。播种质量很好。各地普遍推广了营养钵育苗，解决棉麦两熟茬口的矛盾，全区有35％的棉田是育苗移栽。棉苗移栽后，各地都坚决贯彻了从头管起，一种就管的精神，根据今年播种早，最近气候多变，雨水较多的特点，在播种结束后就组织力量深入田头进行大检查。
    为了加强领导，各地实行专业专管，推行了管理责任制。集中产棉区的社、队把搞好棉花生产作为全党全民的中心任务，由党委第一书记挂帅，全力以赴。粮棉夹种地区都有一个书记专管，建立专业队伍，包干负责。鉴于过去夏收夏种期间，农活紧张，粮食作物既要收割，又要栽种，而棉花培育又是紧要关头，各地特别注意了劳力安排问题，保证以优势力量投入夏收夏种，同时又安排一定的劳力，做好棉田苗期管理，促使棉苗早发，带桃入伏，早熟增产。
