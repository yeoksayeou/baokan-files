(Our newspaper, Changsha, 5th report) The Hunan Provincial Party Committee, led by Provincial Party Secretary Li Ruishan, organized a mobile on-site command post to go deep into the front lines of production, conduct巡回 inspections, promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences, and resolve key problems in a timely manner, promoting the vigorous development of the province's increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution.

Because the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee frequently went deep into the現場, met with基层 cadres and workers, they not only had a more thorough understanding of the actual situation in various aspects such as industrial production, basic construction, and the technical revolution, but also greatly encouraged the revolutionary drive and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and powerfully promoted current production. For example, under the encouragement of the on-site command post's inspection work at the Niumasi Coal Mine, the mine's daily output of bituminous coal broke through the 1,000-ton mark on May 11, creating the highest record this year; from May 1 to May 11, the average daily output increased by 69.5% compared with April. Because each relevant department and bureau had a responsible cadre participating in the on-site command post office, this enabled the Provincial Party Committee's intentions to be implemented more directly and quickly, and major issues related to the overall situation to be resolved in a timely manner. On April 19, when the on-site command post arrived at the Songbai Iron Plant in Changning County, Zhang Pinghua, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave instructions at the on-site meeting on learning from the advanced experience of the Songbai Iron Plant throughout the province, and put forward the leaping progress task of Hunan's iron and steel production this year. The on-site command post immediately convened a meeting to study carefully, and in accordance with the principle of "taking steel as the key link and coal as the guarantee for steel," made corresponding arrangements for the province's coal and coke production tasks this year. In order to universally promote the technological transformation experience of the Songbai Iron Plant, the mechanical industry department was immediately assigned the task of manufacturing a batch of blowers. The blowers produced by Shaoyang Machinery Factory and other units have already been delivered ahead of schedule.

The mobile on-site command post first focused on the key problems of production, and pursued them to the end. For example, in late March, the command post discovered that coal transportation in some areas was temporarily unable to keep up with the needs of the increased production and practice economy movement, because the完好率 of locomotives was low, the coal storage of larger coal mines and coal users was small, and the loading and unloading efficiency was low. After the mobile on-site command post arrived in Zhuzhou City, it immediately mobilized the workers of the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory to promptly repair fourteen locomotives, which powerfully supported coal transportation. Immediately afterwards, the command post convened a meeting, requiring key factories to universally establish coal bunkers that could store coal for ten to fifteen days of use, while striving to improve the degree of mechanization of loading and unloading. When the members of the command post inspected work at Zidian, Xiangyong, Matian and other key coal mines in southern Hunan, they also solved some major problems in production and transportation on the spot. Because the Provincial Party Committee grasped the production and transfer of coal tightly, the daily output of coal and coke in the first half of April increased by 11% and 3% respectively compared with the second half of March, and the daily运量 of coal and coke increased by 30%; Zidian and other key coal mines all completed the plan for transferring coal in April ahead of schedule.

While going deep into key points, the on-site command post tightly grasped the overall leadership of the province's industrial front. For example, the command post discovered in Zhuzhou City that some major technical innovation experiences had not been promoted in a timely manner, so it repeatedly emphasized at the Provincial Party Committee's meeting of industrial department and bureau chiefs and the city party committee's telephone conference of industrial secretaries that advanced experiences should be grasped and promoted in a timely manner, and that they should be effectively applied to production practice, so as to rapidly improve the province's industrial production level. In order to promote the experience of Qibaoshan Coal Mine in Qidong County in achieving sustained leaping progress and accelerate the technical transformation of mines, the on-site command post suggested that the Provincial Party Committee make a decision on carrying out the movement of learning from Qibaoshan and catching up with Qibaoshan in coal mines throughout the province, and set off a surge of "learning from Qibaoshan and catching up with Qibaoshan" in coal mines throughout the province, which played a great role in increasing the province's coal output.

### 湖南省委组织流动现场指挥所  先进经验迅速推广　关键问题及时解决　煤焦产量及时上升

    湖南省委组织流动现场指挥所
    先进经验迅速推广　关键问题及时解决　煤焦产量及时上升
    本报长沙5日电　中共湖南省委以省委书记李瑞山为首组织流动现场指挥所，深入生产第一线，巡回检查，及时总结和推广先进经验，及时解决关键问题，推动了全省以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的蓬勃开展。
    由于省委负责同志经常深入现场，随时同基层干部和职工群众见面，不仅更加透彻地了解了工业生产、基本建设和技术革命等各方面的实际情况，而且大大鼓舞了广大职工的革命干劲和劳动热情，有力地推动了当前生产。例如，牛马司煤矿的职工，在现场指挥所到矿检查工作的鼓舞下，5月11日全矿烟煤日产量突破千吨大关，创造了今年以来的最高纪录；5月1日到11日，平均日产量比4月份提高了69．5％。由于各有关厅、局都有一个负责干部参加现场指挥所办公，这便能更直接迅速地贯彻执行省委的意图，及时解决一些关系全局的重大问题。4月19日，现场指挥所到达常宁县松柏铁厂时，省委第一书记张平化同志，在全省学习松柏铁厂先进经验现场会议上作了指示，提出了今年湖南钢铁生产的跃进任务。现场指挥所立即召开会议，认真研究，并且根据“以钢为纲，以煤保钢”的方针，对今年全省的煤、焦生产任务作了相应的安排。为了普遍推广松柏铁厂的技术改造经验，随即给机械工业部门布置了制造一批鼓风机的任务。邵阳机械厂等单位生产的鼓风机已经提前交货。
    流动现场指挥所首先狠抓生产关键问题，并且一抓到底。如3月下旬，指挥所发现某些地区煤炭运输一时赶不上增产节约运动的需要，原因是机车完好率低，较大的煤矿和用煤户储煤量小和装卸效率低。流动现场指挥所到达株洲市以后，立即发动株洲机车车辆厂职工及时抢修了十四台机车，有力地支援了煤炭的运输。紧接着，指挥所又召开会议，要求重点工厂普遍建立能储十天至十五天用煤的煤仓，同时努力提高装卸机械化的程度。指挥所的成员在湘南地区的资典、湘永、马田等全省重点煤矿检查工作时，也就地解决了生产和运输中的一些重大问题。由于省委对煤炭的生产和调运抓得紧，4月上半月和3月下半月的比较，全省煤、焦日产量就分别增长了11％和3％，煤、焦日运量增长了30％；资典等重点煤矿都提前完成了4月份调运煤的计划。
    现场指挥所在深入重点的同时，紧紧地抓住了对全省工业战线的全面领导。如指挥所在株洲市发现一些重大的技术革新经验没有及时推广，便在省委召开的工业厅、局长会议和市委工业书记电话会议上，反复强调了应该及时抓紧推广先进经验，并把它切实运用到生产实践中去，以便迅速提高全省的工业生产水平。为了推广祁东县七宝山煤矿实现持续跃进的经验，加速矿山的技术改造，现场指挥所建议省委作了关于在全省煤矿开展学七宝山、赶七宝山运动的决定，在全省煤矿掀起了一个“学七宝山、赶七宝山”的热潮，对提高全省煤炭产量起了很大作用。
