    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Tokyo dispatch: This afternoon, 70,000 and 100,000 workers, students, and ordinary citizens successively held demonstrations and mass rallies around the Diet building in two groups to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demand the dissolution of the Diet, and the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

    At 2:00 PM, 70,000 people held a demonstration. Kozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," stood on top of a truck parked among the sea of demonstrators and spoke to the crowd through a loudspeaker. He said that the Japanese people would never recognize the Kishi Nobusuke government's so-called ratification of the "Security Treaty."

    Minakuchi emphasized, "We will never allow politicians who have been following Kishi Nobusuke to come to power. We must establish a democratic government to take over from the Kishi government."

    Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, appealed to the assembly, "Let us overthrow the Kishi government immediately."

    Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, said that the support of the broad masses of Japanese people for today's general strike proves that the Japanese people, who resolutely safeguard their sovereignty, refuse to recognize this treaty.

    Tsuyu Tamura, a stage actor representing the "Security Treaty" Criticism Group, guaranteed that until the "Security Treaty" is crushed, Japanese cultural workers will never lay down their weapons—pens and stage performances.

    The demonstrators marched towards downtown Tokyo. When the procession passed in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the masses shouted slogans and sang labor songs.

    Shop owners and ordinary citizens also responded to the call of the "National Council" and voluntarily demonstrated to the Diet. They marched together with workers and students.

    In the evening, another 100,000 people held a demonstration in the rain.

    A declaration was adopted at the evening rally, expressing refusal to recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Toshio Kamba, the father of Michiko Kamba, who was killed by the police, spoke at the meeting, calling on the newspaper and radio workers participating in the meeting to make further efforts to inform a wider range of Japanese people about the truth of the Diet incident related to the murder of his daughter.

    Professor Senroku Uehara of Hitotsubashi University also spoke at the meeting. He said: The Japanese people have now become the main force in Japanese politics and are influencing world politics.

    Representatives elected by the assembly then visited major newspapers published in Tokyo, demanding that they not cooperate with warmongers.

    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Tokyo dispatch: People from all walks of life in Tokyo today enthusiastically supported the workers' strike and fought heroically together to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    Starting last night, 40,000 workers and students supporting the strike braved torrential rain, occupied various stations, and maintained vigilance all night. Wearing helmets and holding bamboo poles, they formed picket lines to confront the provocations of right-wing elements. Kyodo News said: "The mood of the picket line is very bright and cheerful. They sing folk songs together, showing a bright strike scene."

    Some passengers were also with the picket line. The scope of the strike and picket line has expanded compared to before. Groups of women carried rice balls donated through fundraising.

    Ionosuke Ogawa, Chairman of the Tokyo Station Branch Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, announced while addressing the striking workers at a rally held on the platform that the railway workers' orderly strike dealt a heavy blow to the Kishi government and achieved a great victory. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution stating that they would fight to the end to overthrow the Kishi Cabinet, force the dissolution of the Diet, and smash the new security treaty.

    A professor from Rikkyo University pointed out to the workers and students that only by uniting all the people with the workers as the center to launch a strong struggle can the illegal suppression of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet be prevented. This is a reliable guarantee for achieving final victory. Many stores belonging to the Democratic Commerce and Industry Association in Tokyo's Nakano Ward sent rice balls to the striking workers and picketers at various stations to support the general strike.

    Workers, students, and railway workers supporting the strike held rallies in front of the stations. Socialist and Communist Party members and cultural representatives spoke at the meeting to encourage the workers.

    More than 5,000 civil servants from various government agencies in Tokyo held two-hour workplace rallies during working hours in the morning. Picket lines were set up in front of the buildings of various government agencies. Students who came to support on the road held demonstrations. Leaflets were pasted on the windows of the buildings, reading: "Kishi Nobusuke step down immediately!" "Smash the Security Treaty!"

    A female employee who was distributing leaflets in front of the Ministry of Health and Welfare building in the rain said that with one more effort we will be able to force Kishi Nobusuke to step down. She said that if the Kishi Nobusuke government forcibly approves the new "Security Treaty," we will continue to launch struggles, step by step force it to collapse, force the realization of the dissolution of the Diet, and at the same time must prevent the emergence of a second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    东京十七万人大示威

    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：今天下午先后有七万和十万工人、学生和普通市民分两批在国会周围举行示威游行和群众大会，反对新日美“安全条约”，要求解散国会和推翻岸信介内阁。
    下午二时，有七万人举行游行示威。阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三站在一辆停在人山人海的示威群众当中的卡车顶上，通过扩音器向群众讲话。他说，日本人民决不承认岸信介政府对“安全条约”所谓的批准。
    水口着重指出，“我们决不容许一直追随岸信介的政客上台。我们必须建立民主政府来接管岸政府。”
    社会党书记长江田三郎向大会呼吁，“让我们立即推翻岸政府。”
    共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄说，广大日本人民对今天总罢工的支持证明，坚决维护主权的日本人民拒绝承认这项条约。
    代表“安全条约”批判会的舞台演员田淬保证说，直到“安全条约”被粉碎，日本文化工作者决不放下他们的武器——笔和舞台上的演出。
    示威群众走向东京闹市，当游行队伍经过外务省和东京警视厅面前时，群众高呼口号和唱劳工歌曲。
    商店主和普通市民也响应“国民会议”的号召自动向国会示威。他们同工人和学生一起游行。
    傍晚，又有十万人冒雨举行示威游行。
    在傍晚的大会上通过宣言，表示拒绝承认新日美“安全条约”。
    被警察杀害的桦美智子的父亲桦俊雄在会上讲话中呼吁参加大会的报纸和电台的职工们进一步努力，使更广大的日本人民了解同他的女儿被杀害的事件有关的国会事件的真相。
    一桥大学的上原专禄教授也在会上讲话。他说：日本人民现在成了日本政治中的主力，而且正在影响世界政治。
    大会选出的代表随后访问了在东京出版的主要报纸，要求它们不要和战争贩子合作。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：东京的各界人民今天热情地支援工人的罢工，共同为打倒岸信介内阁、粉碎日美军事同盟条约而英勇斗争。
    从昨天夜里开始，四万名支援罢工的工人和学生冒着倾盆大雨，占领各个车站，通宵警戒，他们头戴盔形帽、手持竹竿，组成纠察线，同右翼分子的挑衅相对抗。共同社说：“纠察队的情绪是非常明朗而快活的。他们合唱着民谣，表现出明朗的罢工情景。”
    有些乘客也同纠察队在一起。罢工和纠察的范围比以前扩大了。有一组一组的妇女搬运来募捐所得的饭团。
    国营铁道工会东京车站分会斗争委员长小川伊之助在月台上举行的大会上向罢工工人讲话时宣布，铁路工人秩序井然地举行罢工对岸政府给与了沉重的打击，取得了巨大胜利。大会一致通过决议表示，他们将为打倒岸内阁、迫使解散国会和粉碎新安全条约而斗争到底。
    立教大学一位教授向工人和学生们讲话时指出，以工人为中心，全体人民团结起来展开坚强斗争，只有这样才能阻止岸信介内阁的非法镇压，这是取得最后胜利的可靠保证。东京中野区的许多属于民主商工会的商店为了支援总罢工，向各个车站的罢工工人和纠察队员送去了饭团子。
    支援罢工的工人、学生和铁路工人在车站前面举行了奋起大会。社会党和共产党议员和文化界代表在会上讲话鼓舞工人。
    东京各个政府机关的五千多名公务人员在上午分别在工作时间内举行了两小时工作场所大会。各个政府机关大厦前面都布置了纠察线。在路上前来支援的学生举行着示威游行。在大厦的窗户上面贴满了传单，上面写着：“岸信介立即下台！”，“粉碎安全条约！”
    一名在厚生省大厦前面冒雨散发传单的女职员说，再加一把油我们就能够迫使岸信介下台。她说，如果岸信介政府强行批准新“安全条约”，我们也要继续展开斗争，一步一步迫使它崩溃，迫使实现解散国会，同时必须阻止出现第二个岸信介内阁。（附图片）
