Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

Revolutionize the Word "Waste": Make the Most of Everything

The key question for vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization is what? It's nothing other than whether people's minds are liberated, whether they have a high sense of responsibility for creating more wealth for society, and a spirit of continuous revolution.

Some people don't believe that politics can create material wealth, but please look at these facts: The same "waste" gas, "waste" liquid, "waste" materials, and "waste" residue, why do some places let them go to waste, flow away, and be discarded, while many cities and villages are vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, extracting treasures from them, and striving to create "four-no's" cities and "four-no's" people's communes? The same sawdust and wood shavings, why do some people throw them away as waste and burn them, while others make full use of them to create various building materials and dozens of chemical products such as acetic acid, methanol, and alcohol? Isn't this just a difference in people's ideology and style?

Some people are confused by the word "waste." In their view, waste is useless, and waste materials are things that should be discarded. Because they believe these materials are already waste, they cannot explore what treasures might still be in them. In fact, there has never been any waste since ancient times; what exists is only things that have not been fully utilized by people. Human feces are waste excreted by humans, but they are very good fertilizer for crops and are now also a raw material for producing large amounts of biogas. Many products of high value are made from so-called waste materials. Especially in the Great Leap Forward, when there is a need for a large number of raw materials, we must never allow a large number of useful things to be thrown away with a "waste" label on them. We must resolutely revolutionize the word "waste," break the superstition of "waste," establish the belief that there is infinite potential, and resolutely make the most of everything.

### 革“废”字的命　物尽其用

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    革“废”字的命　物尽其用
    大搞综合利用的关键问题是什么？不是别的，是人们的思想有没有解放，有没有为社会创造更多财富的高度责任心和不断革命精神。
    有人不相信政治能创造物质财富，可是请看这些事实吧：同样是“废”气、“废”液、“废”料、“废”渣，为什么有的地方让他们白白地放掉、流掉、抛掉，而许多城市和乡村，却正在大搞综合利用，从中取宝，努力创造“四无”城，“四无”人民公社呢？同样是锯末、木屑，为什么有的人当成废物甩掉、烧掉，有的人却充分利用起来创造出各种建筑材料和醋酸、甲醇、酒精等几十种化工产品呢？这不是人们的思想风格不同，又是什么呢？
    有的人被一个“废”字迷糊住了，在他们看来，废者无用也，废物者，应该遗弃之物也。因为他们认定这些物资已经作废了，也就不能探索其中还有什么宝物。其实，自古以来就没有什么废物，有的倒是没有被人们充分利用之物。人粪，是人排泄出来的废物，对农作物则是很好的肥料，现在，还成为产生大量沼气的原料哩。许多价值很高的产品，正是用所谓废料制成的。特别是在大跃进中需要大量原材料的情况下，我们绝不能让大量有用之物，被带上一顶“废”的帽子白白抛弃了。我们要坚决革掉“废”字的命，破除“废”字迷信，树立起潜力无穷的信念，坚决做到物尽其用。（摘自湖北日报）
