Comrades!

    For ten years, the American imperialist bandits have occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, plotting to create "two Chinas," constantly carrying out war provocations against our country, and brutally interfering in and suppressing the revolutionary movements of people of all countries. They have frantically carried out arms expansion and war preparations, committing heinous crimes against the people of our country and the people of the world. The militia of our capital are determined to unite with the people of the whole country, and with all peace-loving people of the world, to wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism.

    Our Iron and Steel Militia Division maintains good combat training. From our own personal experience, we deeply understand that the only way to deal with American imperialism is to wage a tit-for-tat struggle. To deal with wolves, you must have tools to fight wolves. To deal with American imperialist war provocations, you must have the people's own revolutionary armed forces. Faced with the aggression and oppression of American imperialism, we must resolutely resist, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

    American imperialism, like all reactionaries, is a paper tiger. As long as the people of all countries unite, imperialism and all reactionaries can be overthrown. The people of South Korea, the people of Japan, and the people of Turkey have heroically risen up to oppose the rule of American imperialism and its running dogs. The result of the struggle proves that the losers are the reactionaries of the Rhee Syngman, Menderes, and Nobusuke Kishi ilk, while victory belongs to the heroic people. Eisenhower, that wolf, wanted to go to Japan a few days ago to do evil, but when he saw the Japanese people raising their sticks, he was so scared that he tucked his tail between his legs and ran away. The facts fully prove a truth: as long as the oppressed people awaken, act, and form a broad united front against imperialism, this will be an incomparably powerful force, and imperialism and its running dogs will show their true colors as paper tigers.

    The struggles of the people of all countries against imperialism and in defense of world peace support each other. We resolutely support the struggles of the people of Japan, the people of South Korea, the people of Turkey, and the people of other regions of the world against imperialist aggression and oppression. At the same time, the struggles of the people of all countries also support us.

    Our Capital Iron and Steel Militia Division is determined to fight together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the liberation of Taiwan, for supporting the national democratic movements of the people of all countries, for crushing the war provocations of American imperialism, and for defending world peace. We must work hard in production, increase steel production, hold guns in our hands, be ready at all times, and intensify military technical training. We guarantee to achieve: if you need iron, we have iron; if you need steel, we have steel; if you need people, we have people. If the front lines use one more ton of shells, we will produce ten more tons of steel! During the period of peaceful construction, our militia must become shock brigades and main forces on the production front, and strive to accelerate the construction of our country's national defense industry base.

    If American imperialism dares to impose war on the people of our country, as soon as we hear the call of the motherland, we can immediately form combat corps and immediately throw ourselves into battle. Every one of our communes, factories, mines, and schools will become a strong fighting fortress. We must let the American imperialists know that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Let us shout: People of the world, unite and defeat American imperialism!

    用革命武装对付美国野心狼
    石景山钢铁公司民兵师师长周冠五同志们：
    美帝国主义强盗，十年来霸占着我国的领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”，不断对我国进行战争挑衅，蛮横地干涉和镇压各国人民的革命运动，疯狂地进行扩军备战，在我国和全世界人民面前犯下了滔天罪行。我们首都的民兵决心和全国人民在一起，和全世界一切爱好和平的人民在一起，团结起来，和美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    我们钢铁民兵师保持着良好的战斗训练。我们从自己的切身经验，深深地体会到，对付美帝国主义，只有进行针锋相对的斗争。对付狼，就得有打狼的工具。对付美帝国主义的战争挑衅，就得有人民自己的革命武装。对美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，我们只有坚决地反抗，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。
    美帝国主义和一切反动派一样都是纸老虎。只要各国人民团结起来，帝国主义和一切反动派都是可以被打倒的。南朝鲜人民、日本人民和土耳其的人民，英勇地起来反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统治，斗争的结果证明失败的是李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介之流的反动派，而胜利则是属于英雄的人民。艾森豪威尔这只狼，前些日子想去日本为非作歹，但是看到日本人民举起了棍子，就吓得夹起尾巴回头就逃。事实充分证明了一个真理：只要被压迫的人民觉醒起来，行动起来，结成广泛的反帝统一战线，这就是无比强大的力量，而帝国主义和它的走狗就会显出纸老虎的原形。
    各国人民反对帝国主义保卫世界和平的斗争都是相互支援的。我们坚决支持日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民以及世界其他地区人民反对帝国主义侵略压迫的斗争。同时，各国人民的斗争也支持了我们。
    我们首都钢铁民兵师，决心和中国人民解放军一起，为解放台湾而奋斗，为支援各国人民的民族民主运动而奋斗，为粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅、保卫世界和平而奋斗。我们要一手努力生产，增产钢铁，一手拿枪，随时戒备，加紧军事技术锻炼。我们保证作到：要铁有铁，要钢有钢，要人有人。前方多打一吨炮弹，我们就多产十吨钢铁！在和平建设时期，我们民兵要成为生产战线上的突击队和主力军，为加紧建设我国国防工业的基础而努力奋斗。
    如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我国人民头上，我们只要听到祖国的一声召唤，就可以立即编成作战兵团，马上投入战斗。我们的每一个公社、每一个厂矿、学校，都将成为坚强的战斗堡垒。我们要让美帝国主义者懂得中国人民是不好惹的！让我们高呼：全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
