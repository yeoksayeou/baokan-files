Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: According to an announcement by the U.S. military authorities stationed in Okinawa, the U.S. Third Marine Division stationed in Okinawa will conduct a joint amphibious "exercise" with the South Korean puppet army in Pohang, South Korea, in mid-June, involving the participation of the army, navy, and air force. This is part of a series of activities by the United States in the Far East to create tension and actively prepare for war.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Okinawa, one of the purposes of this U.S. "exercise" is to coordinate with U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to South Korea as "an act to demonstrate strength." This shows that Eisenhower's conspiratorial activities in South Korea this time are aimed at strengthening the U.S. military's aggressive deployment there and attempting to further use force to intimidate and suppress the South Korean people who are launching a high tide of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. According to earlier reports, the U.S. Forces Korea Command announced on June 4th that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea had begun a series of provocative so-called "training exercises" in South Korea from the 4th, and ordered all troops in South Korea to be on "alert status."

    配合艾森豪威尔访问加强侵略部署
    冲绳美军将与南朝鲜傀儡军联合演习
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：据美国驻冲绳军事当局宣布，美国驻冲绳的第三海军陆战师将于本月中旬同南朝鲜的傀儡军队在南朝鲜的浦项联合举行有海陆空三军参加的两栖“演习”。这是美国在远东制造紧张局势、积极进行备战的一系列活动的一部分。
    据合众国际社发自冲绳的一则消息说，美国这次“演习”目的之一是为了配合美国总统艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜访问，作为“显示力量的一次行动”。这表明，艾森豪威尔这次到南朝鲜阴谋活动，是要加强美国在那里的军事侵略部署，并且企图进一步动用武力来恫吓和镇压掀起反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争高潮的南朝鲜人民。据前些时候报道，侵朝美军司令部在6月4日宣布，侵朝美军从4日开始已经在南朝鲜举行一系列的挑衅性的所谓“训练演习”，并且命令在南朝鲜的所有部队处于“警戒状态”。
