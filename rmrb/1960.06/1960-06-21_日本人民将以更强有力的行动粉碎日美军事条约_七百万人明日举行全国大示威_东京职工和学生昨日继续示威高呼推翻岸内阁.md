Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 20th: The Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" today adopted an action plan to launch a nationwide movement against the "Security Treaty," including a general strike by workers on June 22nd.

According to the plan, the movement on June 22nd will be larger in scale than the movements on June 4th and June 15th, with participation reaching seven million people. Workers in various regions will hold strikes, and students, farmers, and cultural figures will participate in the movement in various ways.

The main force of the June 22nd movement will be a workers' strike even larger than the one on June 4th. National railway workers and national locomotive workers will be the core of the striking workers on June 22nd. From the first train until 7:00 AM, they will hold two to three-hour workplace rallies at major stations throughout Japan. This is effectively equivalent to a two to three-hour strike. The railway workers' strike will bring all train traffic across Japan to a halt during the rallies.

Urban transportation workers in Tokyo and Osaka will also halt streetcars and buses from early morning until 7:00 AM. In Yokohama and other major cities, streetcars and buses will also be suspended.

Government employees and postal workers will hold two-hour workplace rallies across the country during working hours. Teachers belonging to the Japan Teachers Union will strike from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, holding two-hour rallies. Government employees belonging to other unions will hold one to two-hour workplace rallies.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All-Japan Day Laborers' Union, and the All-Japan Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation will hold twenty-four-hour strikes. The All-Japan Dockworkers' Union, the All Printing Bureau Workers' Union, and the Taxi Drivers' Union will hold one to twenty-three-hour strikes. Workers belonging to other unions in private enterprises will hold workplace rallies.

While workers are striking, the National Council will host two mass rallies on June 22nd, to be held at 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM, respectively. After the rallies, massive demonstrations will be held near the National Diet Building and near the official residence of Nobusuke Kishi. The first rally will be attended by 100,000 people, mainly members of the Kyoto Workers' Union and private enterprise union members. The second rally will be attended by 70,000 government employees, state-owned enterprise employees, and private enterprise workers. Students will take their own actions in cooperation with the workers. At the same time, mass rallies will be held in front of the three major train stations in Tokyo, with participants joining voluntarily. After the rallies, attendees will march to the vicinity of the Diet to demonstrate.

On the eve of the June 22nd strike, mass rallies will be held in Tokyo and other major cities to show mass support for the striking workers. It is expected that approximately 100,000 students, farmers, merchants, and cultural leaders will participate in the mass rally in Tokyo. Among those attending, 30,000 will go to major stations to support railway workers. They will participate in picket duties overnight or engage in other activities to help striking workers.

The "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" also decided today to launch a nationwide movement to purge reactionary politicians. According to the decision, organizations belonging to the National Council will compile a list of reactionary politicians such as Nobusuke Kishi, publicize it to the masses, and recommend that voters remove these politicians from the political arena.

The National Council also decided to hold a "national funeral" on June 24th for Michiko Kamba, the female student killed by the police.

Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, Buddhist monk Keibun Nishikawa, Christian leader Momoyo Kubushiro, renowned actor Koreya Senda, and many other prominent figures issued a joint appeal this afternoon, urging people to attend Michiko Kamba's "national funeral."

The funeral will be held at Hibiya Hall and Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall at 1:00 PM. After the funeral, participants will march to the Diet to demonstrate. Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 20th: Two thousand workers belonging to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union held a mass rally at 2:00 PM this afternoon in the plaza next to the Diet Building, expressing their determination to oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and protesting the government's suppression of the people's movement against the "Security Treaty."

Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, emphasized in his speech at the rally that workers should now show their greatest strength and hold a powerful strike on June 22nd, demanding the dissolution of the Diet before the exchange of ratification documents for the new "Security Treaty."

The participants then began demonstrating around the Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, and in front of the Metropolitan Police Department. They shouted: "We will victoriously hold the strike on June 22nd!" "Overthrow the Kishi Cabinet!"

At the same time, approximately 4,000 students from Tokyo, Meiji, Hosei, Waseda, Chuo, and other universities demonstrated in front of the Diet's front gate at 2:00 PM.

After the rally, the students held a massive demonstration in front of the Prime Minister's official residence and went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, holding a rally in front of police headquarters, demanding the immediate release of the arrested students. The students then marched to nearby stations, where they split into groups and went to major train stations to conduct street propaganda, calling on ordinary citizens to support the railway workers' strike on June 22nd and raising donations for the injured and arrested students.

The demonstrating students also thronged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was the first time since the start of the unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." (Attached picture)

    日本人民将以更强有力的行动粉碎日美军事条约
    七百万人明日举行全国大示威
    东京职工和学生昨日继续示威高呼推翻岸内阁
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天通过了6月22日展开包括工人总罢工在内的反对“安全条约”全国运动的行动计划。
    根据计划，6月22日的运动将比6月4日和6月15日的运动规模更大，参加的人数将达七百万。各地工人将举行罢工，学生、农民和文化界人士将以各种方式参加运动。
    6月22日运动的主要力量将是比6月4日声势更大的工人罢工。国营铁道工人和国营机车工人将是6月22日罢工工人的核心，他们将从第一班火车起直到上午七时止，在日本各地的大站举行二、三小时的工作场所大会。这实际上等于举行二、三小时的罢工。铁路工人的罢工将使日本各地的火车在举行大会期间全部停驶。
    东京和大阪的都市交通运输工人，也将从一早起到七点钟停驶电车和公共汽车。在横滨和其它主要城市，电车和公共汽车也将停驶。
    政府公务人员、邮政工人将在全国各地在工作时间内举行两小时的工作场所大会，日本教职员工会所属的教师将在上午八时到十时罢教，举行两小时的大会。属于其它工会的政府职员，将举行一至两小时的工作场所大会。
    日本煤矿工会、合成化学产业工会联合会、全日本散工工会、全日本金属矿山工会联合会，将举行二十四小时的罢工。全日本码头工人工会、全印刷局工会、出租汽车司机工会，将举行一至二十三小时的罢工。属于私营企业的其它工会的工人将举行工作场所大会。
    在工人罢工的同时，国民会议将于6月22日主持两个群众大会，分别从下午二时和六时举行。会后，将在国会附近和岸信介官邸附近举行声势浩大的示威。第一个大会将有十万人参加，主要是京都职员工会会员和私人企业工会会员。第二个大会将有七万名政府职员、国营企业职工和私营企业工人参加。学生们将在同工人合作的情况下采取自己的行动。同时，将在东京三个大车站前面举行由群众自愿参加的群众大会。到会者将在大会以后到国会附近去示威。
    在6月22日罢工前夕，将在东京和其他大城市举行群众大会，表示群众支持罢工工人。预料，东京将有大约十万名学生、农民、商人和文化界领袖参加群众大会。在到会的人中，有三万人将到大车站去支援铁路工人。他们将通宵参加纠察工作或进行其他帮助罢工工人的活动。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天还决定发动全国性的肃清反动政客的运动。根据决定，国民会议所属团体将编制岸信介等反动政客的名单，向群众公布，建议选民把这些政客从政界中清除出去。
    国民会议还决定在6月24日举行被警察杀害的女学生桦美智子的“国民葬”。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎、佛教法师西川景文、基督教领袖久布百落实、著名演员千田是也和其他许多知名人士在今天下午发表联合呼吁书，要求人们参加桦美智子的“国民葬”。
    葬礼将在下午一时在日比谷会堂和日比谷圆形剧场举行，在葬礼结束以后，参加葬礼的人将列队前往国会举行示威。新华社20日讯　东京消息：东京都政府职员工会所属的二千名职工20日下午二时在国会大厦旁边的广场上举行群众大会，表示他们决心反对新日美“安全条约”和抗议政府对人民反对“安全条约”运动的镇压。
    社会党书记长江田三郎在大会上讲话时强调说，工人现在应该显示出他们最大的力量，在6月22日举行强有力的罢工，要求在互换新“安全条约”批准书前解散国会。
    与会者然后开始在国会、首相官邸周围和警视厅前面举行示威。他们高呼：“我们将胜利地举行6月22日的罢工！”“推翻岸内阁！”
    同时，东京、明治、法政、早稻田、中央等大学的约四千名学生下午二时在国会前门面前举行示威。”
    在大会后，学生们在首相官邸前面举行声势浩大的示威，并前往东京都警视厅，在警察总部前举行大会，要求立即释放被捕的学生。学生们接着游行到附近的车站，他们从那里分批前往各大火车站去进行街头宣传，呼吁普通市民支持6月22日的铁路工人罢工，并为受伤和被捕的学生募捐。
    示威学生曾经拥到外务省去。自从阻止修改“安全条约”的统一行动开始以来，这还是第一次。（附图片）
