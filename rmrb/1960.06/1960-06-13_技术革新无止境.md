    Technological Innovation is Endless
    Huang Bingzhong, Luoyang, Henan
    From January to May this year, the workers of the No. 1 Garment Factory of Luobei People's Commune in Luoyang City implemented 343 innovations on sewing machines. This number would not be surprising if it happened on a very complex machine with thousands upon thousands of parts. However, it happened on a sewing machine with a simple structure. Even counting all the parts, large and small, a sewing machine has only sixty-odd parts. This means that, allocated by parts, each part has been innovated more than five times in five months.
    Faced with this moving event, we naturally feel admiration for the workers of the No. 1 Garment Factory. Among the workers in this factory, needless to say, there are no mechanical engineers, technicians, or technical staff; it is difficult to find even someone who has a slight understanding of mechanical principles. The vast majority of them are female workers who have just shaken off illiteracy or semi-illiteracy, and they are also housewives who have not been working for long. However, it is precisely these women who have neither education nor a general knowledge of mechanics, design, and electricity who have modified and innovated the machines made by experts, mechanical engineers, and technicians again and again.
    This makes people understand some truths. Women who have been bound by housework for centuries, once freed from these shackles, will spread their wings and soar into the sky like birds released from a cage. The power and wisdom of liberated women are endless.
    At the same time, this also raises a new issue for people: since some housewives who have not been working for long can carry out 343 innovations on a simple sewing machine in just five months, and are still constantly innovating, then people naturally have a broader world to innovate in other sciences, technologies, and machinery and equipment. Of course, new machines replacing old machines are the law of the development of things, and also the main content and driving force of technological progress. However, the potential of technological revolution in one thing or one object is also endless. As long as we dare to think and dare to do, and continue to revolutionize, technological innovation will never end, and the achievements will become greater and greater.

    技术革新无止境
    河南洛阳　黄秉忠
    洛阳市洛北人民公社第一被服厂职工，在今年1至5月的五个月中，在缝纫机上实现了三百四十三项革新。这个数字，如果是发生在成千上万个零件的复杂得很的机器上，自然无足为奇。但是，它却发生在结构简单的缝纫机上。一部缝纫机大大小小都算上也不过六十多个零件。这就是说，按零件分摊，在五个月中，每个零件革新过五次还多。
    面对着这种动人事迹，我们自然对第一被服厂的职工产生敬佩之情。在这个厂的职工中间，不用说没有机械师、技师、技术员，就是稍通机械原理的人，也很难找到。他们绝大多数，都是刚摆脱文盲或半文盲状态的女工，而且是参加工作不久的家庭妇女。但是，正是这些既没有文化，又不懂机械、设计和电气的一般常识的妇女，却对出自专家、机械师、技术员之手的机器，改了又改，革新了又革新。
    这使人们悟出了一些道理。自古被层层束缚在家务劳动中的妇女们，一旦被解除了束缚，就会像出笼鸟一样，展翅高飞，腾空万里。被解放出来的妇女的力量和智慧是无穷无尽的。
    同时，这里也向人们提出了一个新的课题：既然一些刚参加工作不久的家庭妇女，短短五个月的时间内，能够在结构简单的缝纫机上进行了三百四十三项革新，而且还在不断革新，那么人们在其他的科学技术和机器设备上进行革新，自然有着更加广阔的天地。当然，新机器代替旧机器，是事物发展的规律，也是技术进步的主要内容和动力。但是，一事一物的技术革命所发挥的潜力，也是无穷无尽的。只要我们敢想敢干，不断革命，技术革新永无止境，成绩也会越来越大。
