Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Representatives of professors and lecturers from various universities in Beijing held a symposium with the Japanese literary delegation this morning.

The symposium was presided over by Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University. In his speech, he stated that Chinese higher education workers, together with all the Chinese people, resolutely support the just struggle waged by friends in Japanese higher education circles and the entire Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi. Noma Hiroshi, head of the Japanese literary delegation, reported on the detailed circumstances of the Japanese people's and Japanese cultural circles' anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. He once again thanked the Chinese people for their sincere support of the Japanese people's just struggle. He said that the Japanese people are now concentrating their struggle on opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, opposing Eisenhower, and opposing Japanese militarism. The 18th National Unified Action will bring the Japanese people's struggle into a new stage. He said that although the path of the Japanese people's struggle may be tortuous and complex, the Japanese people, determined to continue the struggle, will surely achieve final victory with the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Japanese literary delegation members Kamei Katsuichiro and Takeuchi Minoru also spoke at the meeting. Kamei Katsuichiro introduced the participation of Japanese education circles in the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. Takeuchi Minoru spoke in fluent Chinese, emphasizing that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism must be recognized and resolutely struggled against. In this struggle, intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants for the struggle to have strength. He expressed that the Japanese intellectual community must combine with workers and peasants and persevere in the struggle to the end.

Professor Yang Hui, Director of the Chinese Department of Peking University, Professor Yan Renying, Deputy Director of the Medical Department of Beijing Medical College, Professor Zhang Wei, Vice President of Tsinghua University, and Zong Ruitang, Director of the Chinese Revolutionary History Teaching and Research Office of Beijing Normal University, spoke successively at the symposium, warmly welcoming the friends of the Japanese literary delegation and expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese cultural and educational workers.

Yang Hui said that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and there should be no illusions about it, only resolute struggle. He addressed Japanese cultural and educational circles: U.S. imperialists have always used culture and education as a guise for aggression. Culture and education cannot be separated from political struggle, and those engaged in cultural and educational work cannot be divorced from the political struggle of the broad masses of the people. He said that Japanese cultural and educational circles have now taken action and joined the ranks of the broad masses of the Japanese people in their anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. Yang Hui compared this action to China's "May Fourth" Movement. He said: A just struggle is never isolated, and a just struggle is bound to be victorious.

Yan Renying spoke about the struggle against U.S. imperialism from the facts she witnessed on the battlefield of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. She said that as a medical worker, she feels that her energy is insufficient to dedicate her entire body and mind to the health of the people, but the brutal U.S. imperialism even used germ warfare on the Korean battlefield to create disasters for mankind. This made her deeply realize that cultural education and medical workers cannot be separated from political struggle. She said that the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea shows that the victory or defeat of a war depends on justice and on the unity of the people's strength. She pointed out that we love peace, but peace cannot rely on begging. To defend peace, we must wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. As long as the Japanese people resolutely struggle, they will surely achieve final victory.

Zhang Wei exposed the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism in carrying out cultural aggression against the people of various countries from the history of Tsinghua University. He said that a wolf is always a wolf, and imperialism is always imperialism. Although it sometimes wears a sheepskin, its essence will never change. He sincerely hopes that the broad masses of Japanese intellectuals and the broad masses of Japanese workers and peasants will unite together, recognize the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, and stride forward towards the common goal of opposing U.S. imperialism until final victory.

Zong Ruitang said that U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are the best teachers by negative example, and the political struggle of the broad masses is the best classroom. To achieve national independence, it is necessary to overthrow the enslavement and rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. In this struggle, intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants, so that the struggle has strength, can be sustained, and can finally bury U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. He wished the Japanese intellectual community to combine with Japanese workers and peasants, persevere in the struggle, and achieve final victory.

Professor Liao Fushu of the Central Conservatory of Music recited a poem he filled in impromptu. The poem wrote: "The deep blue sea shares urgent feelings, the cocks crow everywhere to announce the dawn. Hearing a good line makes my heart overflow. Meeting in the capital, people have changed, but before the enemy, we see our will solidified into a city. The two disaster stars, Eisenhower and Kishi, are at their wit's end."

At the end of the symposium, a telegram from representatives of professors and lecturers from Beijing universities to professors and lecturers from Japanese universities was read. There was warm applause throughout the venue during the reading.

Participating in today's symposium were representatives of professors and lecturers from universities and colleges such as Peking University, Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Medical College, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Institute of Geology, Central University for Nationalities, the Institute of Physical Education, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

    中日两国文化工作者紧密团结起来  坚决斗争反对共同敌人美帝国主义
    北京各大学教授讲师代表和日本文学家代表团座谈
    据新华社14日讯　北京各大学的教授、讲师代表今天上午同日本文学家代表团举行座谈会。
    座谈会由北京大学副校长周培源主持。他在讲话中表示，中国高等教育工作者和全体中国人民一起，坚决支持日本高等教育界朋友和全体日本人民一道进行的反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的正义斗争。日本文学家代表团团长野间宏在会上报告了日本人民和日本文化界反美爱国斗争的详细情形。他再一次感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的诚心诚意的支持。他说，现在日本人民正在把斗争的力量集中到反对艾森豪威尔访问日本、反对艾森豪威尔、反对日本军国主义。第十八次全国统一行动，将使日本人民的斗争进入一个新的阶段。他说，尽管日本人民斗争的道路可能是曲折和复杂的，但是决心继续坚持斗争下去的日本人民，在中国人民和世界人民的支持下，必定取得最后的胜利。
    日本文学家代表团团员龟井胜一郎和竹内实也在会上讲了话。龟井胜一郎介绍了日本教育界参加反美爱国正义斗争的情况。竹内实用流利的中国话讲话，他强调说，必须认清美帝国主义的侵略本质，并且坚决同它进行斗争。在这个斗争中，知识分子必须同工农结合，斗争才有力量。他表示日本知识界一定同工农相结合，坚持斗争到底。
    北京大学中文系主任杨晦教授、北京医学院医疗系副主任严仁英教授、清华大学副校长张维教授和北京师范大学中国革命史教研室主任纵瑞堂先后在座谈会上讲话，热烈欢迎日本文学家代表团的朋友们，并且表示坚决支持日本人民和日本文化教育工作者的正义斗争。
    杨晦说，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，对它不能抱有任何幻想，只有进行坚决的斗争。他寄语日本文化教育界：美帝国主义者一贯利用文化教育作幌子进行侵略。文化教育不能离开政治斗争，从事文化教育工作的人更不能脱离广大人民的政治斗争。他说，现在日本文化教育界已经行动起来，投入广大日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争的行列中。杨晦把这种行动比作中国的“五四”运动。他说：正义斗争决不孤立，正义斗争一定胜利。
    严仁英从她在抗美援朝战场上亲眼看到的事实谈到了对美帝国主义的斗争。她说，作为一个医务工作者，把整个身心全部贡献给人民的健康事业，还感到精力不足，但残暴的美帝国主义竟在朝鲜战场上用细菌战来给人类制造灾难。这使她深刻的认识到，文化教育和医务工作者离开政治斗争是不行的。她说，抗美援朝战争的胜利说明，战争的胜负决定于正义，决定于人民力量的团结。她指出，我们热爱和平，但和平不能依靠乞求，为了保卫和平，我们必须同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。日本人民只要坚决地斗争下去，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    张维从清华大学的历史揭露了美帝国主义对各国人民进行文化侵略的凶恶面貌。他说，狼终归是狼，帝国主义终归是帝国主义，尽管它有时披上一件羊皮，但是它的本质决不会改变。他衷心希望日本广大知识分子和日本广大工农团结在一起，认清美帝国主义的侵略本质，向着反对美帝国主义的共同目标大步前进，直到最后胜利。
    纵瑞堂说，美帝国主义和一切反动派都是最好的反面教员，广大群众的政治斗争就是最好的课堂。要取得民族独立就必须打倒美帝国主义及其走狗的奴役和统治。在这个斗争中，知识分子要同工农结合，这样斗争就有力量，就能持久，就能最后埋葬美帝国主义及其走狗。他祝日本知识界同日本工农结合，坚持不懈地进行斗争，并且取得最后的胜利。
    中央音乐学院教授廖辅叔朗诵了他即席填的一首词。词写道：“碧海深同急难情，雄鸡四处报天明。一闻佳句使心倾。都下相逢人换旧，敌前已见志成城。穷途艾岸两灾星。”
    座谈会最后宣读了北京各大学教授、讲师代表给日本各大学教授和讲师的通电。宣读时，全场热烈鼓掌。
    参加今天座谈会的，有北京大学、中国人民大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、北京医学院、北京农业大学、北京钢铁学院、北京地质学院、中央民族学院、体育学院、中央音乐学院和中央美术学院等院校的教授和讲师的代表。
