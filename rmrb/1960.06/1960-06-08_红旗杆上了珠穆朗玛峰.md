    Conquering the "Death Zone"

In the past, in the field of world aviation physiology, the area above 8,000 meters above sea level was called the "death zone." This is because as the altitude increases, the oxygen in the air becomes increasingly scarce. According to scientists' calculations, the partial pressure of oxygen in the air at sea level is 150 millimeters of mercury, while at an altitude of 8,000 meters, the partial pressure of oxygen drops to 46 millimeters of mercury. This severe lack of oxygen causes various adverse reactions in the human body, and in severe cases, can lead to death.

Therefore, in the history of international mountaineering, altitudes above 8,000 meters have almost been regarded as the "limit" of human mountaineering activities. Without the use of man-made oxygen equipment, even if athletes are very strong and highly skilled, it is unimaginable to climb to such heights and stay for a long time.

However, the heroic Chinese mountaineers, in the battle to conquer the area above 8,000 meters on Mount Everest, used their strong will and fearless spirit to try repeatedly to continue marching without artificial oxygen, and safely and successfully completed their tasks.

The Chinese mountaineering team's battle to conquer the "death zone" of Mount Everest began on May 2nd. During the third march, the main force reached the mountain wall at 7,600 meters above sea level amidst wind, snow, and bitter cold, and some team members continued to advance towards the summit.

At 19:00 Beijing time on May 2nd, the reconnaissance group, composed of the mountaineering team leader Shi Zhanchun, deputy leader Xu Jing, Tibetan team member Laba Cai Ren, and Tibetan team member Mima, began to advance to a height of 8,100 meters above sea level. At this time, the sky was already dim, and they tried to get there that night, first setting up a camp to welcome the arrival of the team members behind.

On the severely weathered limestone slopes, there were accumulations of extremely mobile rubble and rock fragments. Stepping on them, one would immediately sink into the crevices of the rubble and be unable to pull out; stepping on them forcefully, the stones would roll down the rock like hail, easily causing the body to lose balance and fall. In order to gain better adaptability to the high mountain environment, the mountaineers carried lightweight oxygen cylinders but did not use them. They gasped laboriously and moved their feet slowly.

It was completely dark, and the surroundings were blurred, with only the snow on the distant mountains emitting a faint white light. Gusts of piercingly cold wind constantly struck the rocks, making a mournful whistling sound. The mountaineers probed the road with ice axes, watching the stars in the sky to discern the direction. The heavy footsteps vibrated in the night sky of the valley, and the steel-nailed alpine boots struck sparks on the rocks. Late at night, they finally arrived at the predetermined place and set up their tents.

    Excellent Sons of the Tibetan People

The small amount of food they carried had been exhausted after several days of marching. Due to the heavy wind, snow, and bitter cold, the supply team had not kept up. Everyone could only rely on a few mouthfuls of fried noodles and a few candies to maintain a half-hungry, half-full life every day. Now, even this half-hungry, half-full state could not be maintained. After more than ten hours of exhausting marching, everyone's stomachs were growling. The support team transporting supplies would not arrive until noon the next day at the earliest. If they went hungry for another night, they would not have the strength to move forward tomorrow, and the entire marching plan would be disrupted. People sat in the tents, unable to find any good solution. At this time, Tibetan team member Laba Cai Ren and Tibetan team member Mima stood up, picked up their ice axes, and carried their backpacks, firmly requesting permission to return to the camp at 7,600 meters above sea level that night to find a solution. Shi Zhanchun and Xu Jing were so moved that they could not speak, shaking their hands tightly and watching them walk into the vast night with indescribable emotion. These two Tibetan youths had not rested for a whole day, and now, for the sake of their comrades and the collective, they were braving the minus 40 degrees Celsius cold wind to embark on their journey. When they returned to the camp at 7,600 meters above sea level, Mima was exhausted and unable to move even one step in the tent. However, the transportation team had still not arrived. Han team members Wang Fengtong, Shi Jing, and Tibetan team member Gongbu quickly packed the fried noodles, less than half a kilogram in total, that they had each carried, and, together with Laba Cai Ren, arrived at the camp at 8,100 meters above sea level at 3:00 a.m. before dawn on the 3rd.

    Advancing to the "Second Step"

In order to further determine the route for the assault on the summit, the next morning, team leader Shi Zhanchun led team members Wang Fengtong, Shi Jing, Laba Cai Ren, and Gongbu, among others, to advance to a higher altitude.

Along the way, the mountaineers still rarely used artificial oxygen. Although they felt particularly tired all over and their hearts were beating particularly hard, they persisted, believing that the so-called "death zone" was not insurmountable.

The mountaineers stepped over the snowy slopes and walked onto the side ridge of a narrow mountain ridge, successfully bypassing the famous "First Step" below the summit of Mount Everest. Not long after, the mountaineers walked onto a steep slope covered with layers of yellow weathered rock. This steep slope, like a belt, encircled the bottom of the summit of Mount Everest. People called it the "Yellow Band," and it was once a headache for the British "expedition." Now, the Chinese mountaineers had also passed through it smoothly.

Team members Shi Jing, Laba Cai Ren, and Gongbu stopped at a height of 8,500 meters to establish the Chinese mountaineering team's last camp on Mount Everest—the "Assault Camp." People would depart from here during the fourth march to seize the summit of Mount Everest.

Team leader Shi Zhanchun and team member Wang Fengtong were not satisfied with reconnaissance at this altitude alone, and they decided to continue advancing. Not far from the departure point at 8,500 meters above sea level, the "Second Step," which the British "explorers" considered "insurmountable," blocked their way.

This was a steep and smooth rock wall, approximately 30 meters in relative height, with an average slope of about 60 to 70 degrees. People could hardly find any support points for climbing. Twenty or thirty years ago, the British "expedition" had tried every possible method here but still failed to climb it. Later, they concluded about the "Second Step" saying, "This is a major obstacle, and there is no need to waste time climbing it anymore."

    A Miracle in the History of World Mountaineering

Shi Zhanchun and Wang Fengtong crawled on the rocks and climbed upwards. They crossed huge rock slopes and finally reached near the top of the "Second Step" at 8,600 meters above sea level at 21:00 Beijing time that day, 300 meters higher than the original target altitude of 8,300 meters for the third acclimatization march. At this time, it was already dark, and everything in front of them was pitch black, and they could not see anything clearly. In order to accurately find the route to assault the summit, they decided to spend the night here and scout again after dawn the next day. They found a snow-filled crack in the rock wall of the "Second Step" and dug a low snow cave with ice axes, and the two sat closely together.

The night wind howled, and the temperature inside the snow cave was around minus 40 degrees Celsius. Because the supply of materials was not available, Shi Zhanchun and Wang Fengtong, in order to pave the way for the victory of the main force, insisted on marching on an empty stomach, and now they were enduring the cold, waiting for dawn to arrive.

Because there was not much artificial oxygen left, and to prepare for any eventuality, Shi Zhanchun and Wang Fengtong boldly decided not to use artificial oxygen. They breathed heavily and spent the whole night. In the history of world mountaineering, not using oxygen at an altitude of 8,600 meters was unprecedented.

The next morning, the sky above Mount Everest was cloudless, and the continuous peaks were bathed in brilliant sunshine.

Shi Zhanchun and Wang Fengtong walked out of the snow cave. Now, the "inaccessible" summit of Mount Everest was no more than 200 meters away from them, and the pointed conical summit appeared clearly before their eyes. Weathered turtle patterns were exposed on the gray rock walls, and narrow cracks were dotted with white snow. With their rich mountaineering experience, they quickly observed a suitable route to the summit.

On May 4th, Shi Zhanchun led the team members back down the mountain to the base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level. After thirteen days of battle, they successfully "overfulfilled" the task of the third acclimatization march.

    红旗杆上了珠穆朗玛峰
    新华社记者　郭超人
    征服“死亡地带”
    在过去世界航空生理学上，曾把拔海八千米以上高度地区称作“死亡地带”。因为随着拔海高度的逐步上升，空气中的氧气也愈加缺乏。据科学家们的测算，拔海高度为零的海平面上，空气中氧气分压是一百五十个毫米水银柱，而到拔海八千米的高度时，氧气分压就下降到四十六个毫米水银柱。这种严重缺氧的状况，给人类身体机能带来各种不良的反应，严重的可致死亡。
    因此，在国际登山运动史上，拔海八千米以上的高度，几乎被看作是人类登山活动的“极限”，如果不使用人类自制的氧气设备，即使运动员体格非常强健、技术非常熟练，要攀登到这样的高度，并停留较长的时间，也是难以想像的。
    但是，英雄的中国登山队员们却在征服珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千米以上地带的战斗中，用坚强的意志和大无畏精神，多次尝试了不用人造氧气继续行军，并且安全、胜利地完成了任务。
    中国登山队征服珠穆朗玛峰“死亡地带”的战斗，是从5月2日开始的。大队在第三次行军中，冒着风雪和严寒到达拔海七千六百米的山壁以后，一部分队员又继续朝着顶峰前进。
    5月2日北京时间十九点，由登山队队长史占春、副队长许竞、藏族队员拉八才仁和藏族队员米马组成的侦察组，开始向拔海八千一百米的高度进发。这时，天色已经昏暗，他们争取当夜赶到，先把营地建起，迎接后面队员的到来。
    严重风化的石灰岩的坡岭上，堆积着极易滚动的乱石和岩片。脚踩下去，立刻陷进乱石缝里拔不出来；用力蹬踏，石块就像冰雹一样向岩下滚泻，极易使身体失去平衡而摔倒。为了取得对高山环境更好的适应能力，登山队员们虽然背着轻便的氧气筒，但并没有使用，他们艰难地喘着气，缓慢地挪动着脚步。
    天完全黑了，四周朦胧一片，只有远处山峦上的积雪发出微弱的白光。阵阵刺骨的寒风不时撞击着山岩，发出凄厉的啸声。登山队员们用冰镐试探着道路，看着天空的星斗辨别方向。沉重的脚步声在山谷的夜空中震荡，带有钢钉的高山靴踩击在石块上迸出点点火花。深夜，他们终于来到了预定的地方，支好了帐篷。
    藏族人民的优秀儿子
    携带的少量食品，经过几天来的行军，已经一无所剩了。由于特大的风雪和严寒，运送物资的队伍一直没有跟上。大家每天只能依靠几口炒面、几块糖果，维持半饥半饱的生活。现在，连这种半饥半饱的状态也维持不住了。十多个小时的疲惫行军，大家的肚子都在吱吱叫唤。运送物资的支援小组最快也要到第二天中午才能赶到，如果再饿一夜，明天就不会再有力量前进了，整个行军计划也就会被打乱。人们坐在帐篷里，找不到任何好的办法。这时，藏族队员拉八才仁和藏族队员米马站起来，拿起冰镐，背上背包，坚决地请求允许他们连夜返回拔海七千六百米的营地去想办法。史占春和许竞激动得说不出话，紧紧地和他们握手，怀着难以形容的感动的心情，目送他们往苍茫的夜色中走去。这两个藏族青年整整一天没有休息，此刻为了同志为了集体，又顶着摄氏零下四十度的寒风走上征途。回到拔海七千六百米的营地时，米马已经筋疲力尽，躺在帐篷里一步也动弹不了。但是，运输队仍未赶上来。汉族队员王凤桐、石竞和藏族队员贡布连忙把他们几个人自己携带的共重不到一斤的炒面装好，同拉八才仁一道，在3日的黎明前三点钟赶到了拔海八千一百米的营地。
    向“第二台阶”挺进
    为了进一步确定突击顶峰的路线，第二天上午，队长史占春带领王凤桐、石竞、拉八才仁和贡布等队员，开始向更高的高度前进。
    一路上，登山队员们仍然很少使用人造氧气，虽然他们全身感到特别的疲倦，心脏跳动得特别猛烈，但他们坚持着，他们相信所谓的“死亡地带”并不是不可战胜的。
    登山队员们踏过点点白雪的山坡，走上一条狭窄的山岭的侧脊，成功地绕过了珠穆朗玛顶峰下著名的“第一台阶”。又过了不久，登山队员们走上了一层铺盖着重重叠叠的黄色风化石的陡坡。这个陡坡像一根腰带一样围绕在珠穆朗玛顶峰的下面，人们叫它“黄色的带子”，这里也曾经是英国“探险队”大伤脑筋的地方。现在，中国登山运动员们又很顺利地通过了。
    队员石竞、拉八才仁和贡布三个人在拔海八千五百米的地方停下来，建立中国登山队在珠穆朗玛峰上的最后一座营地——“突击营地”，人们将在第四次行军时从这里出发，夺取珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。
    队长史占春和队员王凤桐不满意仅仅在这个高度上的侦察，他们又决定继续前进。从拔海八千五百米出发不远，拦在眼前的就是被英国“探险家”们认为“不可超越”的“第二台阶”。
    这是一座陡峭而光滑的岩壁，相对高度约三十米，平均坡度在六、七十度左右，人们几乎找不到任何攀登的支撑点。二、三十年前的英国“探险队”，曾经在这里想尽了一切办法，仍然没有能攀登上去。后来，他们对“第二台阶”下了一个结论说：“这是一个很大的障碍，再也不必浪费时间去爬它了。”
    世界登山史上的奇迹
    史占春和王凤桐匍匐在岩石上向上攀登，他们翻过巨大的岩坡，终于在当天北京时间二十一点登到了拔海八千六百米的“第二台阶”顶部附近的地方，这比第三次适应性行军原定到达的拔海八千三百米的高度，已高出三百米。这时，天已经黑了，眼前黑糊糊一片，什么也看不清楚。为了准确地找到突击顶峰的路线，他们决定在这里过一夜，等第二天天亮以后再进行侦察。他们在“第二台阶”的岩壁上找到了一条积雪的裂缝，用冰镐挖成一个低矮的雪洞，两个人紧紧地挤着坐在一起。
    夜风高啸，雪洞里气温在摄氏零下四十度左右。由于物资运输供应不上，史占春和王凤桐为了给大队开辟出胜利的道路，饿着肚子坚持行军，现在又忍受着寒冷，守候黎明的到来。
    因为携带的人造氧气所剩不多，以防备万一，史占春和王凤桐大胆地决定不用人造氧气。他们沉重地喘着气，整整过了一夜。在世界登山史上，在八千六百米的高度不使用氧气，这还是破天荒的第一次。
    第二天清晨，珠穆朗玛峰上空万里无云，连绵的峰峦沐浴着灿烂的阳光。
    史占春和王凤桐走出雪洞，现在，珠穆朗玛峰“高不可攀”的顶峰，离他们不过二百多米，尖锥形的顶峰清晰地出现在他们眼前。灰色的岩壁上露出一道道风化的龟文，白雪点缀着狭窄的裂缝。凭着他们丰富的登山经验，他们很快就观察到了一条适宜的登上顶峰的路线。
    5月4日，史占春又带领着队员们开始返回山下拔海五千一百二十米的大本营。经过十三天的战斗，他们胜利地“超额”完成了第三次适应性行军的任务。
                                                （三续）
