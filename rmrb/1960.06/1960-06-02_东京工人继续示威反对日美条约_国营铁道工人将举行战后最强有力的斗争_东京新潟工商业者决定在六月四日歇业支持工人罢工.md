Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: Following the seventeenth national unified action against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty which began yesterday, approximately 2,500 workers held protest demonstrations in front of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's official residence and the U.S. Embassy tonight. Industrial workers, teachers, and government employees participating in the demonstrations shouted, "Kishi Nobusuke, now is the time for you to leave this house!" "We do not accept the decisions made by the violently rampaging Diet!" "The House of Representatives should be dissolved immediately!"

The demonstration then marched to the U.S. Embassy. They shouted: "Yankees, go home!" "Withdraw the black jets (i.e., U.S. spy planes)."

The workers who participated in the demonstration then held a meeting in the plaza in front of the Diet. Communist Party member Yoshio Shiga emphasized the importance of the general strike on June 4th at the meeting.

Daishiba Shigeru, representative of the "National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty," emphasized in his speech at the meeting that in the past month, the Japanese people have accomplished unprecedented feats, such as the large-scale demonstration at the U.S. Embassy and the two hundred thousand-person demonstration around the Diet. He pointed out that the police authorities cannot suppress the demonstrations and marches of the Japanese people.

The movement to collect twenty-seven million signatures is proceeding on a large scale today.

Communist Party Chairman Nozaka Sanzo and General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji, along with more than fifty other leaders, spent the entire day in front of major train stations in Tokyo calling on the people to sign petitions demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

At the same time, prominent figures from all walks of life have issued statements supporting the general strike by workers on June 4th. Okamoto Take, director of Keihin Central Hospital, said, "This is a moment of great importance. We thank the workers for their determination to take such strong action, because the strike embodies the will of us all."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: The Japan National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union issued a joint statement yesterday, announcing that Japanese railway workers will hold the largest strength struggle since the war on June 4th to prevent the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The struggle of the railway workers is one of the focal points of the general strike on June 4th. Because Japanese law deprives civil servants of the right to strike, the two unions will carry out the struggle by holding two-hour workplace meetings.

The statement said, "The railway workers' strength struggle on June 4th will certainly be the most powerful one since the end of the war. We are taking strength struggle to resolve the problems faced by all Japanese people."

The statement called on people from all walks of life in Japan to give the railway workers' struggle on June 4th their greatest support. It is reported that the Nobusuke Kishi government's national railway authorities issued a "serious warning" to the national railway workers last night in an attempt to suppress their struggle. The railway authorities threatened that if workers "violate the law and participate in the general strike on June 4th," "severe disciplinary measures" will be taken against them.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: Jiro Shindo, secretary-general of the National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Organizations of Japan, wrote in today's "Akahata" that 10,000 merchants in Tokyo will close their businesses on June 4th to show their opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Jiro Shindo wrote: "Let us follow the example of the merchants of Gunma, which has now become a slogan for merchants throughout Japan. The merchants believe that the workers' strike cannot be isolated from the masses of the people. We are taking our own actions to support the strike." According to a report in today's "Nai-Gai Times," the Niigata Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently decided that its 600 member manufacturers and stores will close their factories and shops for one to nine hours on June 4th to participate in the seventeenth national unified action against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The participation of Japanese business circles in the unified action shows that Nobusuke Kishi is becoming increasingly isolated and that the patriotic struggle against the United States and Nobusuke Kishi has developed more and more widely.

    东京工人继续示威反对日美条约
    国营铁道工人将举行战后最强有力的斗争
    东京新潟工商业者决定在六月四日歇业支持工人罢工
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本人民昨天开始反对日美军事同盟条约的第十七次全国统一行动后，今天晚上又有约二千五百名工人在岸信介首相官邸和美国大使馆前面举行抗议示威。参加示威的产业工人、教职员和政府职员们高呼：“岸信介，现在是你离开这所房子的时候了！”“我们不接受暴力横行的国会所作出的决定！”“众议院应当立即解散！”
    示威队伍接着游行到美国大使馆。他们高呼：“美国佬，滚回去。”“撤走黑色喷气机（即美国间谍飞机）”。
    参加示威的工人随后在国会广场上举行大会。共产党议员志贺义雄在大会上强调指出6月4日总罢工的重要意义。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”代表大柴滋夫在大会上讲话时强调指出，在过去一个月中，日本人民作出了空前的事迹，例如向美国大使馆进行的大规模示威和国会周围的二十万人示威。他指出，警察当局镇压不了日本人民的示威游行。
    征集二千七百万签名的运动今天正在大规模地进行。
    共产党主席野坂参三和总书记宫本显治等五十多位领导人，今天整天在东京各主要火车站前面，号召人民在要求废除新日美“安全条约”的抗议书上签名。
    同时，各界著名人士纷纷发表声明，支持工人在6月4日举行总罢工。京滨中央医院院长冈本丈说，“这是关系重大的时刻。我们感谢工人决意采取这样强有力的行动，因为罢工体现我们大家的意愿。”
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会昨天发表联合声明，宣布日本铁路工人在6月4日将举行战后最大的实力斗争，来阻止批准日美军事同盟条约。
    铁道工人的斗争是6月4日总罢工中的重点之一。由于日本法律剥夺了公务人员的罢工权，这两个工会将以举行两小时的工作场所大会的方式展开斗争。
    声明说，“6月4日铁道工人实力斗争，肯定将是自从大战结束以来从未有过的最强有力的一次。我们采取实力斗争是为了解决所有日本人民所面临的问题。”
    声明呼吁日本各界人民给予铁道工人6月4日的斗争以最大的支持。据报道，岸信介政府的国营铁道当局曾经在昨天晚上对国营铁道工人们提出“严重警告”妄图镇压铁道工人的斗争。铁道当局威胁说，如果工人“破坏法律参加6月4日的总罢工”，将对他们采取“严厉的纪律措施”。
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本全国工商团体联合会总书记进藤甚四郎，在今天的“赤旗报”上写道：在6月4日，东京的一万名商人将歇业以表示反对新日美“安全条约”。
    进藤甚四郎写道：“让我们效法群马的商人的榜样，现在这已成为日本各地商人的口号。商人们认为，工人的罢工不能孤于人民群众。我们正在采取自己的行动来支持罢工”。据“内外时报”今天报道，新潟商工会最近决定，它所属的六百家会员厂商在6月4日关厂关店一小时至九小时，以参加反对日美军事同盟条约的第十七次全国统一行动。日本工商界参加统一行动，表明岸信介的越来越孤立和反对美国和岸信介的爱国斗争已发展得日益广泛。
