Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Tunis: The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a statement in Tunis on the 20th, announcing that it would send a delegation headed by Ferhat Abbas to meet with French President De Gaulle.

The statement, read by Ferhat Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, stated that De Gaulle's broadcast speech on the evening of the 14th "reaffirmed the Algerian people's right to self-determination in a clear manner. According to the wording of this statement, the final decision rests with the Algerian people."

The statement said, "While reiterating its statement of June 11, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria believes that the current position of the President of the French Republic is a progress compared to his previous positions, but it is still far from its (the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria) position."

The statement said, "However, in the hope of ending the fighting and resolving this issue definitively, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has decided to send a delegation headed by Mr. Ferhat Abbas to meet with General De Gaulle."

Later the same day, Abbas also issued a letter to the Algerian people regarding the decision of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to negotiate with France. The letter explained this action, saying, "This decision was made within the scope of our policy"; "According to this policy, while strengthening armed struggle, we should seize or seek all opportunities that are conducive to a peaceful resolution of the problem."

The letter to the people said, "The start of negotiations does not yet mean peace." It urged the Algerian people to "remain vigilant more than ever."

The letter to the people said, "The Algerian people should continue to be in a state of war mobilization"; "The Algerian National Liberation Army will continue to fight resolutely until we reach our goals."

The letter to the people said, "All of us must persist in the struggle more than ever until we obtain the right to self-determination, not just in words but in deeds."

    阿尔及利亚临时政府决定同法国谈判
    同时宣布民族解放军将继续斗争直到取得自决权为止
    新华社21日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府20日在突尼斯发表声明宣布，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府将派遣一个以费尔哈特·阿巴斯为首的代表团和法国总统戴高乐会晤。
    由阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理费尔哈特·阿巴斯宣读的这项声明认为，戴高乐在14日晚上发表的广播讲话，“用明确的方式，重新肯定了阿尔及利亚人民的自决权。根据这个声明的措词，最后的决定权属于阿尔及利亚人民”。
    声明说，“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在重申它在6月11日的声明的同时，认为法兰西共和国总统目前的立场和他前几次的立场比较是一个进展，但是，同它（阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府）的立场仍然相差很远。”
    声明说，“然而，为了希望结束战斗和肯定地解决这个问题，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府决定派遣一个以费尔哈特·阿巴斯先生为首的代表团和戴高乐将军会晤。”
    阿巴斯在同天稍后一些时候还就阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府决定同法国谈判发表了告阿尔及利亚人民书。告人民书解释这一行动说，“这一决定是在我们的政策范围内作出的”；“依据这一政策，在加强武装战斗的同时，我们应该抓住或寻找一切有利于和平解决问题的机会”。
    告人民书说，“开始进行谈判还不意味着和平”。它要阿尔及利亚人民“比任何时候都应该保持警惕”。
    告人民书说，“阿尔及利亚人民应该继续处于战争动员状态”；“阿尔及利亚民族解放军将继续坚决地进行斗争，直到我们达到目标为止”。
    告人民书说，“我们所有的人比任何时候都要坚持斗争，直到我们不是在口头上而是在行动上获得自决权为止”。
