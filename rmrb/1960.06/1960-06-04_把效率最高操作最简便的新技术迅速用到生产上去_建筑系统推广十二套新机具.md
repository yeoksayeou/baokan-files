Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: National construction and installation enterprises are vigorously promoting the "Twelve Dragons," and are universally carrying out the movement to eliminate "scaffolding" and achieve "ten thousand bricks per day" with one technician and one strong laborer. This is a new development in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the construction sector.

The "Twelve Dragons" are a summary of the experiences of the twelve major types of work in national construction and installation enterprises in achieving "four modernizations." These twelve types of work include: bricklaying, concrete production, plastering, rebar processing, earthwork, hoisting, carpentry, whitewashing, painting, transportation, plumbing and electrical equipment installation, and industrial equipment installation. These twelve dragons and the machinery used to eliminate scaffolding allow each type of work to replace the past manual operations with the most efficient and simplest machines and tools from start to finish.

These experiences have been selected, finalized, summarized, and improved by the Ministry of Construction Engineering before being promoted. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering selected a batch of relatively mature construction machines from various provinces and cities in various "dragons" and conducted on-site performances in Beijing. They also organized the creators of advanced machinery, workers, and engineering and technical personnel from construction science departments, as well as machinery and equipment, construction, and design units, to comprehensively improve them. The construction machinery for the twelve major types of work were standardized and matched into a dragon to facilitate promotion in various regions. Now, national construction and installation enterprises are organizing battles in batches, concentrating efforts to manufacture equipment on a large scale, and universally promoting the "Twelve Dragons."

The automatic and semi-automatic concrete production lines composed of units in Harbin and Dalian, from gravel feeding, screening, water supply, metering, mixing, and transportation to tamping, all implement automatic control or remote control. They can be used on-site or fixed in prefabrication plants, averaging an increase in efficiency of ten to twenty times.

Many construction sites in Hebei, Hunan, Fushun, Shenyang, and other provinces and cities have eliminated scaffolding around May Day. In Shenyang, construction companies all dismantled the scaffolding in one day and night. The elimination of scaffolding in construction projects is due to the promotion of the automatic lifting platform created by the Third Construction and Installation Company of Hebei Province. This automatic lifting platform is available in both steel and wood structures. It can be moved up and down or left and right according to construction needs. The use of this platform saves a lot of wood for scaffolding and greatly improves the working conditions of bricklayers and installers. Workers praise the use of this platform as a great turnaround and liberation in their labor.

The "four-four" bricklaying method is also being rapidly promoted throughout the country. This bricklaying method uses a bricklaying device to replace hand-held bricks, and can lay four bricks at a time, which can increase efficiency by more than nine times, and the quality of the walls is good, the wall surface is flat, and the mortar is full.

    把效率最高操作最简便的新技术迅速用到生产上去
    建筑系统推广十二套新机具
    据新华社2日讯　全国建筑安装企业正在大力推广“十二种龙”，普遍开展取消“脚手架”和一个技工一个壮工“日砌万块砖”运动，这是建筑部门技术革新、技术革命运动的新发展。
    “十二种龙”是全国建筑安装企业中十二个主要工种实现“四化”的经验总结。这十二种工种包括：砌砖、混凝土制作、抹灰、钢筋加工、土方工程、吊装、木工、粉刷、油漆、运输、水暖电工设备安装、工业设备安装。这十二种龙和用于取消脚手架的机具，使每个工种从头到尾的操作，都以效率最高、操作最简便的机械和机具代替了过去的手工操作。
    这些经验在推广之前都经过建筑工程部选型、定型、总结和提高。最近建筑工程部从各省市抽调了一批比较成熟的各种“龙”的施工机具，在北京进行现场表演，并且组织了先进机具的创造者、工人和建筑科学部门以及机械设备、施工、设计等单位的工程技术人员，加以综合改进，把十二个主要工种的施工机具，定型配套成龙，以利各地推广。现在，全国各建筑安装企业，正在分批组织战役，集中力量大搞设备制造，普遍推广“十二种龙”。
    哈尔滨和旅大市一些单位组成的混凝土生产自动线、半自动线，从砂石喂料、筛分、给水、计量、搅拌、运送直到捣固，全部工序都实行了自动控制或远距离控制，既可以在施工现场流动使用，也可以固定在预制厂使用，平均提高效率十倍到二十倍。
    河北、湖南、抚顺、沈阳等省市的许多工地，在五一劳动节前后已经取消了脚手架。沈阳市各建筑企业一昼夜间全部放倒了脚手架。在建筑工程中取消脚手架，是由于推广了河北省第三建筑安装公司创造的自动升降工作台。这种自动升降工作台，分钢结构和木结构两种。它可以根据施工的需要上下移动或左右移动。采用这种工作台，既节省了大量的搭架脚手架的木材，又大大改善了瓦工和装工的工作条件，工人们都称颂使用这种工作台是他们在劳动中的大翻身和大解放。
    “四四”砌砖法也正在全国各地迅速推广。这种砌砖法是以砌砖器代替手拿砖，一次能砌四块，可以提高效率九倍多，而且砌出的墙壁质量好，墙面平整，砂浆饱满。
