To ensure the regular and systematic promotion of advanced experience, Baoji has established advanced experience promotion stations.
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 17th) In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Baoji City has universally established "Advanced Technology Experience Supporting Promotion Stations" by industry and type of work, making the work of promoting advanced experience regular and systematic.

In order to make the promotion of advanced experience a regular practice, the Baoji Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided at the end of March this year to establish "Advanced Technology Experience Supporting Promotion Stations" throughout the city according to industry and type of work. These supporting promotion stations are located in units with relatively good technical innovation work, and widely absorb workers, leading cadres, and technical personnel of the same type of work from various factories to participate. At present, there are more than twenty advanced technology experience supporting promotion stations in the city, with more than 3,800 innovation experts, technical personnel, and leading cadres participating in activities. They are developing into bases for the vast number of employees to conduct scientific and technological research.

Entrusted by the Municipal Party Committee, the Advanced Technology Experience Supporting Promotion Stations are responsible for understanding the progress of the technical revolution movement in the same type of work and industry, conducting research, holding regular meetings, and exchanging technical innovation information. They continuously gather thousands of innovations and creations from the broad masses of employees, and repeatedly study, compare, and appraise them through "three-way combination" representative meetings, then learn from each other's strengths and discard weaknesses, remove the crude and retain the refined, and organize them into supporting sets. In this way, scattered, piecemeal, and individual advanced technologies and advanced experiences gradually move towards perfection, from small to large, from single to complete sets. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-May, the city's more than twenty supporting promotion stations had assembled 54 relatively complete sets of advanced experiences from 305 major innovation projects that had appeared in the city, which were then universally promoted, rapidly improving the technical level of factories and enterprises. For example, the in-plant transportation advanced technology experience supporting promotion station systematically summarized the experiences of various factories and mines in creating rail, wooden rail, and ceramic rail in-plant transportation, and organized promotion based on the specific conditions of each unit. In less than two months, factories and construction sites throughout the city have achieved rail transport.

The advanced experience supporting promotion stations pay close attention to learning, researching, and promoting major advanced experiences from other places, and also pay attention to studying the new experiences and new problems that arise in the process of promoting these experiences, making these advanced experiences more suitable for the specific conditions of the locality. The advanced technology experience supporting promotion stations have also promoted a great alliance in production between enterprises. The textile printing and dyeing supporting promotion station found that Xinqin Textile Factory and Zhenxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory had a lot of repetitive labor in the production process, such as Xinqin Textile Factory's yarn having to be reeled and packaged when it left the factory, while Zhenxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory had to unpack and reel the yarn when dyeing it. Therefore, the promotion station suggested that the two factories implement a great alliance in production. As a result, the bobbin yarn of Xinqin Textile Factory was directly transferred to Zhenxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory for dyeing, reducing several processes for both parties and saving equipment and labor.

### 确保先进经验配套推广经常化制度化  宝鸡建立先进经验推广站

    确保先进经验配套推广经常化制度化
    宝鸡建立先进经验推广站
    本报西安17日电　宝鸡市在技术革新和技术革命运动中，按行业和工种普遍建立“先进技术经验配套推广站”，使推广先进经验的工作经常化、制度化。
    宝鸡市为了使推广先进经验的工作经常化，中共宝鸡市委在今年3月底决定在全市范围内按行业和工种成立“先进技术经验配套推广站”。这些配套推广站都设在技术革新搞得比较好的单位，广泛吸收各厂同工种的工人、领导干部和技术人员参加。目前，全市已有二十多个先进技术经验配套推广站，三千八百多名革新能手、技术人员和领导干部参加活动。它们正在发展成为广大职工进行科学技术研究的基地。
    先进技术经验配套推广站受市委的委托，负责了解同工种、同行业的技术革命运动进展情况，进行研究，定期召开会议，交流技术革新情报。他们不断地把广大职工群众中成千上万的革新创造集中起来，通过“三结合”代表会议的反复研究、比较、鉴定，然后取长补短，去粗取精，加以整理配套。这样就使分散的、零星的、单项的先进技术和先进经验，由点滴到系统、由单项到成套，逐步走向完善。据不完全的统计，截至5月中旬，全市二十多个配套推广站就分别将全市出现的三百零五项重大革新项目，配成了五十四套比较完整的先进经验，在普遍推广以后，使工厂企业的技术水平得到了迅速提高。例如，厂内运输先进技术经验配套推广站，系统地总结了各厂矿企业创造的铁轨、木轨、陶瓷轨等厂内运输轨道化的经验，并且根据各单位的具体条件组织推广，在不到两个月的时间内，全市工厂和工地就实现了轨道化。
    先进经验配套推广站很注意学习、研究和推广外地的重大先进经验，并且注意研究推广这些经验过程中出现的新经验和新问题，使这些先进经验更加适合本地的具体情况。先进技术经验配套推广站还促进了企业之间生产上的大联合。纺织印染配套推广站发现新秦纺织厂和振兴染织厂生产过程中重复劳动很多，如新秦纺织厂的纱出厂时必须倒筒、打包，而振兴染织厂染纱时又要拆包、倒筒，于是推广站就建议两厂实行生产上的大联合。结果新秦纺织厂的洛筒纱直接调给振兴染织厂去染纱，双方都减少了几道工序，节约了设备和劳动力。
