Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: U.S. President Press Secretary Hagerty was in Tokyo today making intense arrangements for Eisenhower's "visit."

This morning, he held a secret meeting with Nobusuke Kishi at the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence. At that time, many people were holding protest demonstrations outside Kishi's official residence, shouting slogans against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi.

Hagerty issued a statement in Tokyo on the evening of the 10th, announcing that the plans for Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan would not be changed.

However, this U.S. presidential advance man, who was surrounded by angry masses at the airport yesterday and finally had to escape to the embassy by helicopter, said with lingering fear that he hoped not to let "the president also encounter the situation we are in today."

Very ridiculously, this Mr. Hagerty actually expressed "gratitude" at a press conference for the "welcome" and "friendly feelings" of the Japanese people towards him yesterday.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: Amid the roaring shouts of 240,000 people in Tokyo, the flustered and exasperated U.S. President Press Secretary Hagerty secretly left Tokyo tonight and fled to Alaska.

    为艾森豪威尔访日部署后
    哈格蒂匆匆溜回美国
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂今天在东京为艾森豪威尔的“访问”进行紧张的部署。
    今天上午，他到日本首相官邸同岸信介举行了秘密会谈。当时，许多群众正在岸信介的官邸外面举行抗议示威，高呼反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的口号。
    哈格蒂10日晚在东京发表声明，宣布艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的计划不会改变。
    但是这个昨天在机场被愤怒的群众包围最后不得不乘直升飞机逃到大使馆的美国总统先行官，心有余悸地表示，希望不要让“总统也遇到我们今天所陷入的处境”。
    十分滑稽的是，这位哈格蒂先生在记者招待会上，竟然表示“感谢”日本人民昨天对他的“欢迎”和“友好感情”。
    据新华社11日讯　在东京二十四万人的怒吼声中，狼狈不堪的美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂今天晚上偷偷地离开东京，逃往阿拉斯加。
