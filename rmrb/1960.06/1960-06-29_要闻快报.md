	News in Brief
	Hebei and Shaanxi Actively Fight Drought and Rush Planting
	The masses in Hebei, Shaanxi and other places are actively fighting drought, rushing planting, and protecting seedlings. Hebei has not had a thorough rain for a long time. All localities, in the spirit of long-term drought resistance, are grasping water conservancy construction on the one hand, so that areas with water sources can expand the area of high-yield fields as much as possible during summer planting, and are also vigorously grasping high-yield crops. On the other hand, they are using superior forces to attack the "dead ends" lacking water sources, striving to plant crops in a timely manner.
	In the drought resistance struggle in Shaanxi, various places launched large-scale cooperation. The Hanzhong Special District and the communes in Zhouzhi, Xingping and other counties have implemented unified leadership, mutual support, and cooperation, which has greatly promoted summer sowing and autumn field management.
	Jiangxi and other provinces are preventing and controlling rice pests in some areas.
	Jiangxi's early rice is growing well, but some places have already discovered pests such as bagworms, leaf rollers, rice leaf rollers, and stem borers, and are organizing to encircle and annihilate them. Lin’hai, Yiwu, Yongkang, Zhoushan, Ningbo and other counties and cities in Zhejiang Province have already ended the first prevention and control campaign, eliminating early rice pests in their initial stages. In Yizhang County, Hunan Province, 290,000 mu of early rice pests were controlled in five days from May 31 to June 4.
	Qinghai's spring planting area doubled compared to last year
	Farmers of all ethnic groups in Qinghai are reclaiming wasteland and sowing seeds at the same time. The sowing work has now basically ended. According to statistics in mid-June, crops such as spring wheat, highland barley, and rapeseed have been planted twice as much as last year. Hundreds of large and small reclamation areas, covering more than 7 million mu of land, distributed in grasslands, mountains, and plains, spread the slogan "New land catches up with mature land." At present, farmers of all ethnic groups are busy weeding, topdressing, and irrigating crops on the newly reclaimed land, striving for a bumper harvest on the newly reclaimed land.
	Hunan Rushes to Manufacture New Farm Tools for Harvesting Early Rice and Transplanting Late Rice
	All parts of Hunan are actively repairing and manufacturing rice harvesters, rice threshers, rice transplanters, etc., so that the innovation tools can be used for both harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice. Up to now, the province has manufactured more than 36,000 rice harvesters and more than 360,000 rice threshers. Rice transplanters are also being added and repaired.
	A Large Number of Women in Zhejiang Become Experts in New Farm Tools
	In the "Early Rice Exceeding 1,000 Jin" competition movement, women in the vast rural areas of Zhejiang Province vigorously carried out technological innovations. A large number of women commune members have become experts in using new tools for transplanting rice, weeding fields, accumulating fertilizer, and making fertilizer. According to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jinhua, more than 80,000 women have learned the technology of using rice transplanters, and the daily transplanting volume generally reaches three to five mu. In the management of early rice, 280,000 women commune members throughout the province broke the high work efficiency record of weeding three mu per day.

    要闻快报
    河北陕西积极抗旱抢种
    河北陕西等地群众正在积极抗旱抢种保苗。河北长期没有下透雨，各地都本着长期抗旱的精神，一方面抓水利建设，使有水源的地区，在夏种中尽量扩大丰产方的面积，并大抓高产作物。另一方面用优势兵力围攻缺乏水源的“死角”，力争庄稼适时种上。
    陕西在抗旱斗争中，各地展开了大协作。汉中专区和盩厔、兴平等县的公社，都实行统一领导，互相支援，开展协作，大大促进了夏播和秋田管理。江西等省部分地区防治早稻病虫
    江西早稻生长良好，但有些地方已经发现负泥虫、卷叶虫、稻苞虫、钻心虫等虫害，正组织围歼。浙江省临海、义鸟、永康、舟山和宁波等县市已经结束第一个防治战役，把早稻病虫害消灭在初发阶段。湖南省宜章县从5月31日到6月4日五天时间内，就防治了二十九万亩早稻的病虫害。青海春播面积比去年扩大一倍
    青海各族农民一边开荒，一边播种，现在播种工作已基本结束。据6月中旬统计，春小麦、青稞、油菜等作物，比去年多种了一倍。分布在草原、山区、平川上的包括七百多万亩土地的几百个大小垦区，传遍了“新地赶熟地”的口号，目前各族农民正忙着给新垦地上的庄稼除草、追肥、灌水，力争新垦地获得丰收。
      湖南赶制收早稻插晚稻新农具
    湖南各地正积极修造割禾器、打稻机、插秧机等，使抢收早稻、抢插晚稻都能用上革新的工具。到目前止，全省已制造割禾器三万六千多部，打稻机三十六万多部。插秧机也都在添置和修理。
      浙江大批妇女成为新农具手
    浙江广大农村妇女在“早稻超千斤”竞赛运动中，大搞技术革新。大批妇女社员成为插秧、耘田、积肥造肥等方面使用新式工具的能手。据嘉兴、温州、宁波、金华四个专区初步统计，有八万多名妇女学会了使用插秧机的技术，日插数量一般达到三至五亩。在早稻管理中，全省二十八万女社员突破了日耘三亩的高工效纪录。
