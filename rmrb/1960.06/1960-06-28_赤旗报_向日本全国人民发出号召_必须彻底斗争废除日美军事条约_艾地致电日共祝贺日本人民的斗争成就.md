Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 27th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag" newspaper, published an editorial today calling on the people across Japan to strengthen their struggle to abolish the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that merely adopting an attitude of refusing to accept the new "Security Treaty" is not enough to smash the system of American rule over Japan, nor is it enough to mobilize the people for a thorough struggle against the reality of forcibly putting the treaty into "effect."

The editorial said that it is clear to everyone that, due to the development of the situation, the people's struggle to prevent the revision of the new "Security Treaty" should be guided towards abolishing the treaty.

When discussing the characteristics of the current situation in Japan, the editorial pointed out that the situation is very unreliable for the American imperialists and Japanese reactionaries, because the old "Security Treaty" has become invalid, and the new "Security Treaty" has not been recognized by the majority of the Japanese people.

The editorial pointed out that the broad development of the united front against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet shows that it is possible to establish a national democratic united front against traitorous forces and the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The editorial emphasized the need to value the possibility of abolishing the new "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that under the slogan of abolishing the new "Security Treaty," the struggle of the Japanese people will be full of hope and will develop forward more favorably.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 24th: Indonesian Communist Party Chairman D. N. Aidit sent a telegram to Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka today regarding Nobusuke Kishi's forced resignation, congratulating the Japanese people on the victory achieved in their struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The telegram said that the anti-militarist Indonesian people heartily welcome the Japanese people's achievement in overthrowing Kishi Nobusuke. This once again proves that it is the people who determine the course of history, not imperialism and their running dogs. The Indonesian Communist Party hopes that the Japanese Communists, Socialists, and all Japanese people will achieve further victories.

    “赤旗报”向日本全国人民发出号召
    必须彻底斗争废除日美军事条约
    艾地致电日共祝贺日本人民的斗争成就
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本全国人民加强斗争，以便废除新日美“安全条约”。
    社论指出，单是采取拒绝接受新“安全条约”的态度还不足以粉碎美国统治日本的制度，不足以动员人民对用暴力强使条约“生效”的现实进行彻底的斗争。
    社论说，任何人都很清楚，由于情况的发展，应该把人民阻止修改新“安全条约”的斗争引导到废除这项条约。
    社论在谈到目前日本形势的特点时指出，形势对美帝国主义者和日本反动派来说是非常靠不住的，因为旧“安全条约”已经失效，而新“安全条约”已经为日本大多数人民所不承认。
    社论指出，反对岸信介内阁的统一战线的广泛发展表明，建立反对卖国势力和日美军事同盟的全国民主统一战线是有可能的。社论强调必须重视废除新“安全条约”的可能性。
    社论指出，在废除新“安全条约”的口号下，将使日本人民的斗争充满希望、更有利地向前发展。
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地就岸信介被迫下台今天致电日本共产党主席野坂参三，祝贺日本人民在反对岸信介政府的斗争中所取得的胜利。
    电报说，反对军国主义的印度尼西亚人民衷心欢迎日本人民打倒岸信介的成就。这再一次证明，决定历史进程的是人民而不是帝国主义和他们的走狗。印度尼西亚共产党希望日本共产党人、社会党人和全体日本人民获得进一步的胜利。
