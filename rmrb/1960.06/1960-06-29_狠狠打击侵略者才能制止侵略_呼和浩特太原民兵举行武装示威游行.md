Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 28th: More than 12,000 militiamen of all nationalities in Hohhot City gathered and paraded on the 27th, resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism's occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan.
    Wang Zaitian (Mongolian nationality), Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region; Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region; Major General Liu Chang, Director of the Political Department of the Inner Mongolia Military Region; Zhao Zhanshan, First Secretary of the Hohhot Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Chen Bingyu, Secretary and Deputy Mayor; and responsible persons of various people's organizations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Hohhot City attended the meeting.
  The conference began with fifteen cannon salutes and the majestic "Volunteer Army March." Zhao Zhanshan, First Secretary of the Hohhot Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his speech that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace and the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. It is playing a two-faced trick of "fake peace, real war preparations, fake easing, real aggression" in an attempt to deceive the people of the world, but its jackal face has long been exposed by the Chinese people. It has occupied our territory of Taiwan, launched the war of aggression against Korea, sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, and attempted to create new war conspiracies. Zhao Zhanshan expounded the current world situation where the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day, and then said: Only by severely打击 the aggressors can aggression be stopped, and peace can only be achieved through resolute struggle. He called on all militiamen to strengthen militia construction while strengthening socialist construction, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. He said that if U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against us, let it be drowned in our vast ocean of all the people being soldiers. Representatives of militia divisions and regiments from factories, suburban people's communes, government agencies, and schools also spoke at the meeting. They strongly condemned the towering crimes of the American robbers in occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan and attempting to conspire to create "two Chinas," and unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against U.S. imperialist aggression, and expressed their determination to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.
    After the speeches, the fully armed militiamen were reviewed by party and government leaders and marched through the streets in a mighty demonstration parade.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th: More than 12,000 militiamen in Taiyuan City held an anti-U.S. demonstration rally on the afternoon of the 27th. Representatives of various militia groups stated at the meeting that they would always stand at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle and resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of world peace.
    Ever since the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower,污辱ed our territory of Taiwan and expressed his intention to continue to occupy Taiwan, the broad masses of militiamen in Taiyuan City have been filled with indignation. On the one hand, they are striking hard at the American aggressors with high-yield "炮弹" on the production and construction front; on the other hand, they are using every spare moment to step up military training and carry out extensive propaganda activities against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the resolute liberation of Taiwan. Today, the anti-American activities of the city's militia reached a climax. In the afternoon, more than 12,000 representatives of militia divisions from factories, mines, communes, government agencies, schools, and other units, marched in a mighty and vigorous manner to Xinghualing Stadium to hold a powerful armed demonstration rally.
    Zheng Lin, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; Major General Zhang Riqing, Second Political Commissar of the Shanxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Political Commissar of the Taiyuan Militia; and responsible persons of various democratic parties in Shanxi Province attended today's meeting. Li Qi said at the meeting: The root of modern war is imperialism. As long as imperialism exists, the danger of war will not be eliminated. He called on all militiamen to use every spare moment to study diligently and practice hard while being a shock force in socialist construction, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, increase our ability to defend the motherland, and play a greater role in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, for the resolute liberation of Taiwan, and for the defense of world peace.
    Militia representatives of workers, peasants, government agencies, and students also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, all the militiamen held a mighty armed parade.

Millions of militiamen in the Taihang Mountains, which have a glorious history of revolutionary struggle, have held demonstration rallies in battalions and companies in the past few days, angrily denouncing the aggressive crimes of the American bandits.贺文会, an old militia captain who participated in the famous Qinyuan siege during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said at the meeting that imperialism is a paper tiger, a cheap bone. In the past, we used thousands of landmines to frighten the Japanese devils. Now, if U.S. imperialism dares to provoke a war, we will drown it in the sea of all the people being soldiers.徐顺孩 and 张小宝, heroes who killed the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, who once led the militia to resist more than a thousand enemies with thirteen rifles and persisted in the famous kiln cave defense battle, are determined to lead the commune militia to strengthen military training. The militia of Handian Commune in Changzhi City, where militia battalion commander Li Bingbi is located, adopted the form of camping and carried out large-scale anti-American shooting training closely integrated with labor production. The militiamen in the Taihang Mountains also took advantage of every opportunity to carry out extensive anti-American propaganda to the broad masses, inspiring the masses' fighting spirit.

  大会在十五响炮声和雄壮的“志愿军战歌”声中开始。中共呼和浩特市委员会第一书记赵展山在讲话中说，美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人，是中国人民的死敌，它玩弄“假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略”的两面手法，企图欺骗世界人民，但是它的豺狼面目早已被中国人民所揭穿，它侵占了我国领土台湾，发动了侵朝战争，破坏了四国首脑会议，企图制造新的战争阴谋。赵展山阐述了当前东风已经压倒西风，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们正在一天天好起来的世界局势以后说：只有狠狠打击侵略者才能制止侵略，和平只有依靠坚决的斗争才能取得。他号召全体民兵，按照毛主席指示，在加强社会主义建设的同时，加强民兵建设。他说，如果美帝国主义敢于对我们发动侵略战争，就让它淹没在我们全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。在大会讲话的还有工厂、郊区人民公社、机关、学校等单位的民兵师、团的代表。他们强烈谴责美国强盗霸占我国神圣领土台湾，企图阴谋制造“两个中国”的滔天罪行，一致表示坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，表示一定要解放我国神圣领土台湾的决心。

    自从美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔沾污我国领土台湾、并表示要继续霸占台湾以来，太原市的广大民兵怒不可当。他们一面在生产建设岗位上以高产“炮弹”痛击美国侵略者；一面利用一切空隙加紧军事训练，开展广泛的反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾的宣传活动。今天，全市民兵的反美活动达到了最高潮。下午，来自各厂矿、公社、机关、学校等各民兵师代表一万二千余人，雄赳赳、气昂昂地涌向杏花岭体育场，举行了威武的武装示威大会。

    在会上讲话的还有工人、农民、机关、学生的民兵代表。会后，全体民兵举行了声势浩大的武装游行。
    有着光荣的革命斗争历史的太行山百万民兵这几天纷纷以营、连为单位举行示威集会，愤怒声讨美国强盗的侵略罪行。在抗日战争中参加过著名的沁源围困战的老民兵队长贺文会在会上说，帝国主义是纸老虎，贱骨头，过去我们用几千颗地雷就把日本鬼子打得胆战心惊，如今，美帝国主义胆敢挑起战争，我们就把它淹死在全民皆兵的大海里。抗日战争时期曾经率领民兵用十三条步枪抗击了一千多敌人，坚持了著名的窑洞保卫战的杀敌英雄徐顺孩和张小宝，决心带领公社民兵加强军事训练。民兵营长李秉壁所在的长治市韩店公社民兵，采用野营形式，实行和劳动生产密切结合的反美射击大训练。太行山区的民兵还利用一切机会向广大群众进行广泛的反美宣传，鼓舞群众的斗志。
