Opening New Mines

    This newspaper reports that Jianyang County, Fujian Province, is carrying out a mass movement by the whole Party and the entire people to find, report, and develop mines. By the end of May, the county had newly discovered 63 iron ore deposits, of which 21 had already been put into production, with a daily output of more than 100 tons of ore, ensuring that the iron smelting furnaces were well-fed. In May, the county's iron production increased by more than 50% compared with April.

    Jianyang County used to be relatively short of raw materials for iron smelting. The Jianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China made a concrete analysis of the local natural conditions and believed that Jianyang could not be without iron ore. In early May, the County Committee decided to immediately launch a mine-finding and reporting movement, and put forward the slogan: "Everyone should find and report mines, traverse thousands of mountains and ridges, and be sure to have the 'Mountain God' offer treasures." Zhao Cunwang, the County Committee's Secretary for Industry, led geological personnel to trek three hundred li through mountains and rivers, and finally found five mining points. This fact stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for finding mines. In the second half of May, more than 9,000 people in the county were involved in the movement. Commune mountain cultivation teams, forestry logging workers, pine resin workers, and cowherds combined their own production with finding large mining areas. Lunwei and Yingtou brigades of Shuiji Commune, through a mass mine-finding movement, found three iron ore deposits in just three days; Huangken Commune also held specimen exhibitions to help the masses identify iron ore, and the Party Committee Secretary and commune members went up the mountains together to find mines, finding four mining points in five days. At present, 25 small blast furnaces have been newly built near the new mining points throughout the county.

    开辟新矿点
    本报讯　福建省建阳县开展全党全民找矿报矿开矿运动。到5月底止，全县新找到铁矿六十三处，其中已有二十一处投入生产，日产矿石达一百多吨，保证了炼铁炉吃饱、吃好。5月份全县产铁数量比4月份增长50％以上。
    建阳炼铁原料过去比较缺乏。中共建阳县委对本地的自然条件作了具体分析，认为建阳不可能没有铁矿。5月上旬，县委决定立即开展一个找矿报矿运动，并提出：“人人找矿报矿，踏遍千山万岗，定要‘山神’献宝”的口号。县委工业书记赵存旺率领地质人员跋山涉水三百里，终于找到矿点五处。这一事实激发了群众找矿的积极性。5月下半月，全县即有九千多人投入运动，公社耕山队、林场伐木工人、采松脂工人、牧童等结合自己的生产大找矿点。水吉公社仑尾、营头等大队，通过群众性的找矿运动，仅三天的时间，就找到铁矿三处；黄坑公社还举办标本展览，帮助群众鉴别铁矿，并由党委书记与社员一起上山找矿，五天找到矿点四处。目前全县已在新矿点附近新建起二十五座小高炉。
