Two War Hotbeds Threatening World Peace
Zhong Xinqing

After World War II, American imperialism replaced German and Japanese fascism and became the most ferocious enemy of the world's people. In order to realize its ambition of dominating the world, American imperialism has adopted a series of measures such as organizing military blocs and establishing military bases to vigorously expand its aggressive military forces, especially stepping up its support for West German and Japanese militarism as two tools, one in the East and one in the West, for launching new wars.

The conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty marks that the revival of Japanese militarism has developed to the point of openly participating in America’s aggressive military bloc, and under the support of American imperialism, it is actively plotting new war conspiracies. Not long ago, West Germany instigated large-scale anti-Jewish activities in the capitalist world and negotiated with Franco to establish military bases in Spain, which marked that the revival of West German militarism had begun to enter a new stage of openly expanding abroad. In particular, recently, Adenauer visited Japan after visiting the United States. Under the direct planning of American imperialism, Adenauer and Nobusuke Kishi, the representatives of these two militarists, openly colluded and are carrying out new activities in the so-called "Bonn-Tokyo Axis with Washington as the starting point". West Germany and Japan have become two hotbeds of new wars, seriously threatening world peace. As everyone knows, in 1936, Japanese imperialism and Hitler's Germany signed the "Anti-Comintern Pact", forming the German-Japanese axis. The following year, Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against our country. In 1940, the three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan formed the "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo" triangular axis. The following year, fascist Germany perfidiously launched a war against the Soviet Union, and Japan launched the Pacific War. Today, the fact that West German and Japanese militarism have been revived with the support of the most aggressive American imperialism is obviously a dangerous signal to the people of Europe, Asia, and the whole world. The people of the world must maintain high vigilance, unite closely, oppose the United States from turning West Germany and Japan into hotbeds of new wars, and resolutely smash the war plans of American imperialism.

In half a century, German imperialism launched two world wars in Europe, and Japanese imperialism launched a series of wars of aggression in Asia. Historical facts show that when imperialism possesses economic and military strength that it considers powerful, it will expand outwards and provoke wars.

Now the economic strength of West Germany and Japan has exceeded the level before World War II. West Germany's industrial production in 1959 exceeded the total industrial production of pre-war (1936) Germany by 48.3%. Steel production was 30.9 million tons, exceeding pre-war German steel production by 65.5%. Japan's industrial production in 1959 was three times the average annual production from 1934 to 1936 before the war. Steel production was 16.6 million tons, 3.6 times that of the pre-war period. Under the capitalist system, the development of production means an increase in the exploitation of the broad masses of working people, and it only benefits the capitalists, especially the monopoly capitalist groups. The more production develops, the more capital is concentrated. Now the monopoly capital of these two countries, West Germany and Japan, is more concentrated in many industries than before World War II. The seventeen major consortia in West Germany now own 80% of the registered share capital of the country. In the past four years, the share capital of the fifty largest companies in West Germany has increased by 180%. In Japan, twenty-two important industrial sectors have more than half of their production monopolized by less than ten large companies in each sector.

At present, the industrial production of West Germany and Japan is shifting to large-scale arms production. The West German government publicly announced last year that the proportion of domestic military orders would be increased from 40% to 60% in the future. West German monopoly organizations are producing a large number of weapons such as military aircraft and warships by purchasing the production "patents" of foreign military companies and expanding and building new arms factories. Currently, emphasis is being placed on the development of modern weapons. A series of research centers such as the "Rocket Technology and Aerospace Association" and the "German Rocket Research Association" are stepping up research and development of missiles and new types of aircraft. West Germany is actively preparing to produce American "Sidewinder", "Hawk", "Sergeant" and "Mars" missiles, and is preparing to produce nuclear submarines. Japan's industry is also shifting to mass production of arms. According to estimates by the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, the production equipment capacity for conventional weapons such as guns and ammunition has 80% surplus production capacity, which is sufficient to supply the normal needs of more than seventy divisions. Japan is currently developing from conventional weapons to new types of weapons, mainly missiles. Starting in 1961, it will gradually produce "Sidewinder", "Hawk", "Nike-Hercules", "Little John" and "Bomarc" missiles. West Germany and Japan both have great military-economic potential. From the post-war period to 1955, West Germany invested two-thirds of all investments in twelve military-related heavy industries. The ratio of heavy industry to light industry in Japan in 1958 was 57 to 43, which will increase to 66 to 34 in 1962. These heavy industries can be converted to military service at any time. In particular, their vigorously developed atomic industry is closely coordinated with the military. In West Germany, in addition to the six known atomic reactors in operation, twelve more are planned to be built. Japan has one atomic reactor in operation and two under construction. The electronics industry, which is closely related to missiles, is also being vigorously developed in these two countries. At the same time, West Germany and Japan's pre-war arms trusts have been restored. A large number of fascist officers with arms production technology and experience have been placed in the national economic departments and large enterprises so that the economy can serve the military and can quickly enter the war track when necessary.

On the basis of restoring war potential and economic militarization, West Germany and Japan are stepping up their arms expansion and war preparations. West Germany currently has more than 250,000 troops. According to the military expansion plan, the total strength will reach 350,000 by 1963. Japan currently has more than 230,000 troops. According to Japan's current second military expansion plan, the total strength will increase to more than 320,000 by 1965. (The above figures do not include administrative personnel.) The focus of military expansion in both countries is to develop the original conventional forces into an offensive force with tactical nuclear weapons as the core and equipped with conventional weapons in the short term. West Germany has now established "Honest John", "Matador" and other missile units. Plans are underway to expand various missile units in large quantities in the future. Japan has established a missile training team and is actively preparing to establish various missile units such as "Hawk" and "Bomarc". Recently, it also plans to set up ten to fifteen missile bases across the country.

Other war preparations are also increasing in West Germany and Japan. In January and February of this year, West Germany successively passed two "emergency laws" on war mobilization. A large-scale blitzkrieg exercise was also conducted on February 1. In addition, in addition to negotiating with Franco to establish military bases in Spain, it also made the same request to Portugal, Turkey, Greece, France, Italy and other countries, and even wanted to establish military bases on British territory. The Japanese armed forces conducted a partial atomic war exercise in October 1958. The Japanese Navy held joint exercises with the US Seventh Fleet in August 1959, and conducted large-scale anti-submarine exercises in October. The Japanese Air Force also often holds offensive and defensive war exercises with the US Air Force. At the beginning of this year, the Kishi Nobusuke government signed a military alliance treaty with the United States, openly participating in the US military bloc and nuclear strategy system.

Of particular note is that West Germany and Japan's intensified economic militarization and arms expansion and war preparations are being carried out under the leadership of the militarist leaders of these two countries. In order to actively prepare for a war of aggression in terms of manpower, organization, and ideology, they have openly employed a large number of fascists and openly developed fascist organizations. More than 180,000 people in various West German government departments have served in the former Hitler Nazi agencies. In the army, more than 100 senior generals of the army, navy, and air force are all senior officers of Hitler. The veteran fascist, West German Defense Minister Strauss, admitted that not even a captain has not served in Hitler's Wehrmacht. The various departments of the Japanese government are also filled with a large number of militarists. 76% of the generals, 50% of the colonels, and 29.8% of the lieutenants in the army are old fascist soldiers. With the connivance of the government, the old fascist groups in Japan and West Germany have been revived, and many new fascist organizations have emerged. These fascist groups are moving from decentralization to centralization in terms of organization. Their activities have changed from being covert to being open. They adopt various methods to spread militarist ideas and advocate revanchist sentiments.

The monopoly capitalist groups in West Germany and Japan, which are warlike and have deeply ingrained militarist traditions, have launched wars of aggression continuously for half a century in order to compete for markets and spheres of influence, get rid of economic crises, and carry out imperialist expansion. In World War II, thanks to the joint efforts of the people of all countries in the world, led by the Soviet Union, including the efforts of the people of Germany and Japan, the anti-fascist war achieved victory and defeated the fascist forces of Germany and Japan. However, they are not reconciled to their failure and are constantly plotting to make a comeback and stage a return. The Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Proclamation clearly stipulated that the fascist forces in these two countries should be eradicated. As long as these international agreements were strictly implemented, it would have been entirely possible to eradicate the fascist forces and prevent the resurgence of militarism. However, American imperialism went back on its word and brazenly tore up the solemn international agreements, doing everything possible to support the revival of militarism in these two countries. At present, they have restored their war economic foundation, are frantically expanding their arms and preparing for war, and have begun to plot new war conspiracies, and have once again embarked on the old road of militarism. The characteristics of imperialism are monopoly, and the nature of imperialism is aggression and war. All the facts now prove that these natures of these two imperialist countries, West Germany and Japan, have not only not changed in the slightest, but have also developed in new ways compared to before World War II.

West Germany and Japan becoming two dangerous hotbeds of new wars is the result of the vigorous support of American imperialism.

The United States supports and arms West Germany and Japan in order to use them as tools for attacking the socialist camp and invading the world. American imperialism has great ambitions for external expansion. It wants to dominate the world and carry out aggression everywhere, but it has many weaknesses. American imperialism is an enemy of socialist countries and the people of the world and is in a very isolated position. It has many internal contradictions, insufficient troops, and weak combat effectiveness, and it is separated from the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa by vast oceans, and its transportation and supply lines are very long. Therefore, in order to realize its ambitions, while frantically expanding its arms and preparing for war, it must establish military bases everywhere and try its best to force vassal states to act as tools of aggression and cannon fodder for it. In both world wars, the United States spent money to let others do the work, encouraging other imperialist countries to fight first, and then joined in to reap the benefits. It is not accidental that American imperialism wants to support West German and Japanese militarism to become its accomplices in launching new wars.

The American ruling group has never concealed the "special role" that these two militarist countries can play when it launches a war of aggression in the future, regarding West Germany and Japan as the "forward strategic bases" and "fortresses" for the United States to attack the socialist camp from Europe and Asia. Eisenhower once said during his tenure as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group: "As the geographical center of Europe, West Germany has great strategic significance for this continent." Former US Secretary of Defense McElroy openly declared in October last year that Japan is "our (US) fortress in the Far East." The American ruling group has never concealed the intention to use the soldiers of West Germany and Japan as cannon fodder. Former US Army Chief of Staff Collins said in 1950, "It is enough for us (the United States) to supply arms, and our (US) children do not need to shed blood in Europe." He said, "There are enough Germans there" to fight for the United States. Former commander of the US Eighth Army, Eichberg, also said: "American soldiers are the most expensive army in history, but it is very cheap to support the Japanese army." "We should study how to make the American and Japanese armies more closely integrated into a whole."

At the same time, American monopoly capital can also seize huge profits by supporting and arming Japan and West Germany. The United States has used Japan's need for a large number of mechanical equipment to restore and expand its industry, especially using Japan's extreme lack of industrial raw materials and grain, and has turned Japan into an important market for the United States' surplus products. According to Eisenhower himself, one of the reasons why the United States must support Japan is that Japan has now become the United States' "second largest customer" "second only to Canada". American monopoly capital is accelerating the arming of West Germany to make a large number of arms investments. The United States has invested about 350 million US dollars in West German industry in the ten years after the war, but due to the acceleration of arming West Germany, it is expected that 1 billion US dollars will be invested in the West German arms industry in the next six or seven years. Capitalists in the US aircraft, missile and other related new weapons industries are investing large amounts of capital in the West German military industry, or jointly building new arms factories with West German capitalists to conduct joint ventures, or purchasing shares in West German arms companies. The American "Lockheed Aircraft Company" has purchased a large number of shares in the West German "Southern" aircraft industry monopoly group. The American "United Aircraft Company" has obtained 43% of the shares from the "Weser Flugzeugbau" aircraft factory owned by West German Krupp.

American imperialism's revival of West German and Japanese militarism first restored their militarist economic foundations. Regarding this point, the American ruling group also does not conceal it. For example, US Deputy Secretary of State Dillon said at the International Affairs Conference hosted by the Cincinnati World Affairs Committee on February 19 this year: "What has been particularly effective in our policies in Germany (referring to West Germany) and Japan is that we have helped restore the economic foundations that can support democratic systems (should be read as militarist systems) and have achieved success quickly."

After the end of World War II, the United States brazenly tore up international agreements and released a large number of heinous war criminals, including the West German "arms king" Krupp and the Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and other monopoly capitalists, militarists, and fascist soldiers. Under the pretext of "decentralized management," the United States reorganized the monopoly capital of West Germany and Japan according to the intentions of the United States, but in fact, it preserved the monopoly organizations of West Germany and Japan. The United States has also revised the Allied powers' reparations plans for West Germany and Japan several times, and the total amount of reparations has been reduced each time. According to regulations, the factories related to military production that should be dismantled as reparations numbered 1,800 in West Germany and 850 in Japan; but due to the protection of the United States, almost all of them were not dismantled. The huge production capacity in heavy industry, which can serve as the basis for reviving the military industry, has been completely preserved. Only 8% of West Germany's industrial production capacity was damaged by dismantling. In April 1952, the "Allied Headquarters" in Japan officially returned 850 factories to Japan, including aircraft factories, arms factories, weapons research institutes, and shipyards.

The United States has also supported the restoration and development of heavy industry and military industry in West Germany and Japan in terms of funds, technology, and other aspects. From 1945 to June 1958, the total economic assistance and loans provided by the US government to West Germany amounted to US$5.207 billion, a large part of which was directly used in industry. The United States also supported the West German arms industry by transferring production "patents" and helped them produce various new types of weapons. The United States actively helped West Germany develop its atomic industry by providing funds, technology, and atomic fuel in preparation for West Germany to produce nuclear weapons in the future. In order to achieve the goal of reviving the West German arms industry, the United States has been constantly and actively planning to relax restrictions on West German arms production. The restrictions on the production of large ships are about to be lifted, and the restrictions on the production of missile weapons have begun to be lifted. The United States government provided economic assistance and loans to Japan from 1945 to June 1958, totaling US$3.314 billion, a large part of which was invested in the power, steel, petroleum, and machinery industries. The United States also provided Japan with technical assistance through the transfer of production "patents" and other means, with a value of approximately US$300 million, more than half of which was concentrated in the machinery and electrical machinery industries, followed by the chemical industry and the metal industry. Recently, it also transferred the "patent" for producing F-104 supersonic jet aircraft to Japan and will help it produce various missiles. The United States has made a large number of military purchases in Japan, totaling US$6.619 billion from July 1950 to December 1959, which has played an important role in stimulating the production of Japan's military industry.

While restoring the economic foundations of West German and Japanese militarism, American imperialism openly re-armed West Germany and Japan step by step in accordance with a pre-determined conspiracy.

Shortly after the end of World War II, the US occupation authorities instructed the West German fascist organization "Brotherhood" to draft a mobilization and strategic plan for arming West Germany. At the same time, under the guise of various "police" names, the armed forces of West Germany were established. In order to facilitate the arming of West Germany and give it a legal status, the United States has been obstructing the unification of Germany. In September 1949, the Bonn regime was established in the Western occupation zone. In May 1955, West Germany was directly incorporated into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and signed a military agreement with West Germany. Since then, West Germany has openly embarked on the militarist path of arms expansion and war preparation.

After occupying Japan, the United States conducted activities to re-arm Japan. The United States retained the bureaucratic structure and political foundation of the Japanese militarist forces. In 1948, the United States ordered the Japanese government to establish the "Maritime Safety Agency" in order to rebuild the Japanese Navy. In 1950, it ordered Japan to establish a "Police Reserve Force" of 75,000 people. In October of the same year, it began to lift the purge (deprivation of civil rights) of fascist soldiers and militarists, making them the "backbone" of the "Police Reserve Force". In September 1951, the United States and Japan signed the "Security Treaty," giving Japan the obligation to rearm. Japan then established the "Security Agency" in 1952--a disguised Ministry of Defense. In March 1954, the United States and Japan signed the "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," openly assisting Japan in expanding its military power. In the same year, the Japanese government established the "Defense Agency" and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Eisenhower openly admitted in his report to Congress in January this year: "The United States has enabled Japan to develop from having no military capabilities at all to having a considerable number of land, sea, and air self-defense forces."

The armies of West Germany and Japan were equipped by American imperialism. According to materials published by the US Department of Defense, US military assistance to West Germany from fiscal year 1950 to fiscal year 1959 totaled US$919 million, and to Japan totaled US$711 million. West German and Japanese officials also admit that their armies are completely equipped by the United States. Hosinger, Inspector General of the West German Armed Forces and Chief of Staff, said to American military commentator Phillips in May 1959 that West Germany had been provided with $1 billion worth of military equipment by the United States in the past four years, and 80% of the equipment of the West German army was supplied by the United States. According to a recent survey by the "Japan Ordnance Industry Association," an organization of Japanese monopoly capital, "98% of the Defense Agency's main weapons are provided by the United States."

The United States not only supplies West Germany and Japan with conventional weapons, but also provides them with modern weapons. The United States has supplied missile weapons to the three existing missile units in West Germany and will continue to supply them in large quantities. The United States has supplied Japan with "Sidewinder" missiles and recently signed a contract with Japan to sell "Tartar" ship-to-air missiles. The United States has trained 2,000 key members of missile units for West Germany, and another 1,000 are being trained in the United States. Japan has sent officers to the United States to receive training in operating missiles and other nuclear weapons, and plans to send another 250 to the United States for training in the next two years.

The above series of facts fully proves that it is American imperialism that has helped West Germany and Japan restore and develop the economic foundation of militarism, and it is also American imperialism that has re-armed West Germany and Japan. American imperialism is the culprit for making these two countries, West Germany and Japan, war hotbeds again, and is the number one enemy of world peace.

In order to attack the socialist camp, American imperialism is doing its best to support the revival of West German and Japanese militarism. West Germany and Japan themselves, from the reactionary militarist and revanchist standpoints, also demand to collude with the United States in preparation for aggression against the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. In West Germany, a group of fascists led by Adenauer has been clamoring for "recovering lost territories" and "liberating" socialist countries. Not long ago, the West German Defense Forces and the US occupation forces in West Germany jointly conducted a large-scale atomic war exercise, openly taking the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic as hypothetical enemies. In January of this year, Japan signed a US-Japan military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union and China as the main targets of aggression. Recently, Nobusuke Kishi publicly and arrogantly stated that "the Taiwan issue is not a simple issue of China's internal affairs," and he "cannot remain indifferent" if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan. Japanese militarists vainly attempt to use the support of the United States to annex our territory Taiwan again. Facts prove that attacking the socialist camp is the common conspiracy of West Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must maintain high vigilance against this.

However, it must be pointed out that the balance of power between the two major camps has fundamentally changed today. The East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind. The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is incomparably strong, and the unity of the entire socialist camp is as solid as a rock. Anyone who launches a war against socialist countries will have no other result than seeking their own death. Faced with this situation, the militarist forces in West Germany and Japan also have to consider what the consequences will be if they rashly launch an attack on the socialist camp. Water always flows downwards, and bullying the weak and fearing the strong is the nature of imperialism. Who can guarantee that West Germany and Japan, which have been supported by the United States, will obediently follow the command of the United States and not first direct the spearhead of aggression at the capitalist world in order to realize their expansionist ambitions? Even the late US Secretary of State Dulles could not help but raise questions about this. In his book "War or Peace," he said: "Can we be sure that the Germans will shoot in the direction that we Americans think is correct?"

People have become increasingly clear that the collusion between the United States, West Germany, and Japan in the reactionary cause of anti-socialism cannot eliminate or alleviate the contradictions and life-and-death struggles between imperialists. The production of West Germany and Japan is currently the fastest in the capitalist world. However, due to the reduction of territories and colonies and the decrease in population after the war, their market scope and raw material producing areas have been greatly reduced. In addition, due to the emergence of a strong socialist camp and two parallel world markets after the war, and the independence of a series of nationalist countries, the capitalist world market is shrinking and has been divided up by old-line imperialists. Therefore, the more their production develops, the more acute the market problem becomes, and the more they want to expand outwards, squeeze into British and French colonies, and demand a change in the situation where the capitalist world market is monopolized by American and British imperialism. The ruling groups of West Germany and Japan have openly demanded a re-division of the spheres of influence in the capitalist world. West German Economics Minister Erhard called on West Germany in a secret meeting in October 1958 to "concentrate its efforts on the regions of British colonialism that people hate," "squeeze into various regions and kick the British out," thereby "replacing the pound with the mark." Japan's Nobusuke Kishi clamored: "In order to establish the Japanese economy on a solid foundation, it is necessary to establish an economic sphere. To this end, special economic cooperation with Southeast Asia should be a long-term goal of Japan." This is clearly reminiscing about the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" before the war, attempting to reoccupy the Southeast Asian market.

Of course, at present, the spearhead of West Germany and Japan's expansion into the Western interior is mainly not directed at the United States. The ruling groups of West Germany and Japan, which suffered a disastrous defeat in World War II, have become more cunning. They understand that when the United States is still available for them to use, they should avoid rushing headlong and making too many enemies, especially not to overly stimulate the United States; but to use internal Western contradictions, especially American-British contradictions, to collude with the United States and first attack old-line imperialist countries such as Britain and France. For example, in Europe, West Germany is using the so-called "European integration movement" planned by the United States to "unify" the economies, militaries, and politics of European countries and ultimately form a "European Federation," and has assembled the six countries of "Little Europe" to form the "Coal and Steel Community," the "Atomic Energy Community," and the "Common Market," and has launched a fierce struggle with Britain for markets and hegemony. For example, in the intermediate zone, West Germany and Japan are making every effort to infiltrate traditional British and French regions through the export of commodities and capital, economic and technical "assistance," and political wooing, seriously undermining British and French interests and weakening British and French power in these regions.

However, the expansion of West Germany and Japan into the capitalist world cannot but infringe upon the interests of the United States, and will ultimately inevitably have a head-on conflict with American imperialism. In fact, their contradictions with the United States over control and counter-control have gradually become apparent. As early as 1957, when the Soviet Union's man-made satellite went into space and the United States' leading position in the West was further weakened, West Germany took the opportunity to demand that it share the leadership of the North Atlantic Group with the United States and other Western European countries. For example, the joint communiqué issued by West Germany and Italy in October 1957 proposed to establish "joint political leadership" with the United States on an "equal basis." Since then, West Germany has assembled the "Continental European Front" and the "Armaments Triangular Alliance" composed of France and Italy, which are actually means to resist "joint US-British leadership" and the US-British monopoly of nuclear weapons. Ishizaka Taizo, chairman of the "Federation of Economic Organizations," the core organization of Japanese monopoly capital, revealed as early as 1956 the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital to demand independent development, saying that it is necessary to "change the policy of relying solely on the United States and establish Japan's own policy." Recently, Japan is trying to change the situation in which more than 70% of its important industrial raw materials are supplied by the United States and is demanding to switch markets in order to get rid of economic dependence on the United States. In the intermediate zone, West Germany and Japan are also squeezing out the United States while attacking Britain and France. For example, West Germany is stepping up its infiltration into the "backyard" of the United States--Latin America. The proportion of imports in Latin America is constantly rising, rising from almost zero in 1948 to 8.82% in 1958, ranking second. Japan has also begun to expand into Latin America, "establishing economic footholds" through immigration, and expanding exports by investing and providing loans to establish factories and mines.

At present, the outward expansion of the two imperialist countries of West Germany and Japan is mainly economic expansion. The struggle between these two imperialists and other imperialists is mainly a struggle for raw material producing areas, sales markets, and investment sites. But when economic expansion cannot continue by normal means, it will resort to force and embark on the road of military conflict. Lenin once pointed out: "Since the balance of power has changed, what other way is there to resolve contradictions under the capitalist system other than by force?" ① The history of the two world wars and the current reality fully prove that Lenin's thesis is completely correct. The possibility of a new war between imperialist countries caused by the reactionary policy of American imperialism supporting West German and Japanese militarism is entirely possible.

American support for the revival of West German and Japanese militarism has deepened the contradictions between imperialist countries, deepened the contradictions between the people of the world and imperialism, first of all, the contradictions between the West German people and the Japanese people and the reactionaries represented by American imperialism and its running dogs--Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke. The result will inevitably be the upsurge of the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism and its running dogs. Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke stubbornly obstruct the easing of the international situation and frantically prepare for war, which has aroused strong opposition from the people of the world. The anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, centered on opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, has persisted for more than a year, and now this struggle is developing forward on an unprecedented scale. On the late night of May 19, Kishi Nobusuke ignored the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, the serious warnings from China and the Soviet Union, and the solemn condemnation of just public opinion in the world. He violently drove out opposition party members in the Diet and forcibly "passed" the US-Japan military alliance treaty, which aroused even more indignation among the masses of all classes. The turbulent storm of struggle swept the country, pushing the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people to a new stage. Recently, the people of South Korea and Turkey have also launched struggles against American imperialism and its running dogs. Under the colonial rule of American imperialism, there are powder kegs that are about to explode everywhere. Even the mouthpiece of American imperialism, the "New York Post," had to admit: "The flags raised and the slogans shouted from one corner of the world to the other are not in favor of us but against us." History has never developed according to the subjective wishes of the reactionaries. Comrade Mao Zedong said well: "The result of all diehards is always the opposite of their wishes. They always start by harming others and end up harming themselves." ② American support for the revival of West German and Japanese militarism can only be "lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet." Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke being led by the nose by the United States will only accelerate their own demise. Those who harm others will eventually harm themselves, and those who play with fire will surely burn themselves. This is precisely the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries, and it is the law of historical development that does not depend on the will of the reactionaries.

    威胁世界和平的两个战争策源地

    第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义代替了德国和日本法西斯，成为世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义为了实现它独霸世界的野心，采取组织军事集团、建立军事基地等一系列的措施，竭力扩大侵略性的军事力量，特别是加紧扶植西德和日本的军国主义，作为它发动新战争的一东一西的两个工具。
    日美军事同盟条约的缔结，标志着日本军国主义的复活已经发展到公然参加美国的侵略性的军事集团，并且在美帝国主义的支持下，正在积极策划新的战争阴谋。不久以前西德在资本主义世界策动了大规模的反犹太人活动，并同佛朗哥谈判在西班牙建立军事基地，这标志着西德军国主义的复活，已经开始进到公然向外扩张的新阶段。特别是最近，阿登纳在访问美国之后，又访问了日本。在美帝国主义的直接策划下，阿登纳和岸信介这两个军国主义的代表公开进行勾结，并正在进行所谓“以华盛顿为起点的波恩—东京轴心”的新活动。西德和日本已经成为新战争的两个策源地，严重地威胁着世界和平。大家知道，1936年，日本帝国主义和希特勒德国签订“反共产国际协定”，结成德日轴心，第二年，日本就发动了全面进攻我国的侵略战争。1940年，德、意、日三个法西斯国家结成“柏林—罗马—东京”三角轴心，第二年，法西斯德国就背信弃义发动了对苏联的战争，日本发动了太平洋战争。今天西德和日本军国主义，在最富侵略性的美帝国主义扶植下复活起来的事实，对欧洲、亚洲和全世界人民很显然是一个危险的信号。全世界人民必须保持高度的警惕，紧密地团结起来，反对美国把西德和日本变成新战争的策源地，坚决地粉碎美帝国主义的战争计划。
    在半个世纪中，德帝国主义在欧洲发动了两次世界大战，日帝国主义在亚洲发动了一系列的侵略战争。历史事实表明，当帝国主义拥有自以为强大的经济和军事实力的时候，它就要向外扩张，挑起战争。
    现在西德和日本的经济力量已经超过第二次世界大战以前的水平。西德1959年工业生产已超过战前（1936年）全德工业生产的48．3％，钢的产量是三千零九十万吨，超过战前全德钢产量的65．5％。日本1959年工业生产为战前1934—1936年平均年产量的三倍，钢的产量是一千六百六十万吨，为战前的三点六倍。在资本主义制度下，生产的发展意味着对广大劳动人民剥削的加重，而只是有利于资本家，特别是垄断资本集团。生产愈是发展，资本就愈集中。现在西德和日本这两个国家的垄断资本，在很多行业中都比第二次世界大战以前更为集中。西德十七个大财团现拥有全国已登记股份资本的80％。在最近四年内，西德五十家大公司的股份资本就增加了180％。日本有二十二个重要的产业部门，每一部门的半数以上的生产都为不到十家的大公司所垄断。
    目前，西德和日本的工业生产正在大规模地转向军火生产。西德政府已于去年公开宣布今后在国内军事定货的比重将由40％提高到60％。西德垄断组织正在通过购买外国军火公司的生产“专利权”与扩建和新建军火工厂，大量生产各种军用飞机、军舰等武器。目前尤其侧重于现代化武器的发展。“火箭技术和宇宙航空协会”、“德国火箭研究会”等一系列的研究中心正在加紧从事导弹和新式飞机的研究和发展。西德正在积极准备生产美国的“响尾蛇”、“隼式”、“中士”和“马斯”等导弹，并准备生产原子潜艇。日本的工业也在大量转向军火生产。现在枪炮、弹药等常规武器的生产设备能力，据日本“经济团体联合会”估计，有80％的剩余生产能力，足可供应七十多个师的正常需要。日本目前正在由常规武器向以导弹为主的新式武器制造方面发展。从1961年开始，将逐步生产“响尾蛇”、“隼式”、“奈克—赫尔克里士”、“小约翰”和“鲍马克”等导弹。西德和日本的军事经济潜力都是很大的。西德从战后到1955年，与军事有关的十二种重工业投资就占全部投资的三分之二。日本1958年重工业和轻工业的比重为五十七比四十三，1962年将提高到六十六比三十四。这些重工业随时可以转为军事服务。特别是它们正在大力发展的原子工业，更是与军事密切配合的。西德的原子反应堆除已知有六个在运转外，还计划建造十二个。日本有一个原子反应堆在运转，两个在修建。和导弹有密切关系的电子工业，在这两个国家里也在大力发展。同时，西德和日本的战前军备托辣斯已经恢复起来。大批具有军火生产技术和经验的法西斯军官，又被安插在国民经济部门和大企业组织内，以便使经济为军事服务，在必要时可以迅速转入战争轨道。
    在恢复战争潜力和经济军事化的基础上，西德和日本正在加紧扩军备战。西德现有的兵力已达二十五万余人。按照扩军计划，到1963年总兵力将达三十五万人。日本现有兵力已达二十三万余人。按照日本目前第二个扩军计划，到1965年总兵力将增加到三十二万余人。（以上数字均不包括文职人员）现在两国扩军的重点，都是争取在短期内把原来的常规部队发展成为一支以战术原子武器为核心而配以常规武器的攻击性部队。目前西德已建立起“诚实的约翰”、“斗牛士”等导弹部队。计划今后还要大量扩建各种导弹部队。日本已建立起导弹训练队，并正在积极准备建立“隼式”、“鲍马克”等各种导弹部队，最近还计划在全国设置十至十五个导弹基地。
    西德和日本的其他备战活动也在日益加强。今年1月和2月西德接连通过两个关于战争动员的“紧急法案”。2月1日还进行了大规模的闪电战的演习。此外，除同佛朗哥谈判在西班牙建立军事基地外，还向葡萄牙、土耳其、希腊、法国、意大利等国提出了同样的要求，甚至要在英国本土建立军事基地。日本武装部队在1958年10月进行了局部性的原子战争演习，日本海军于1959年8月同美国第七舰队举行联合演习，10月又进行大规模的反潜艇演习。日本空军也常同美国空军一起举行攻防战演习。今年初，岸信介政府同美国签订了军事同盟条约，公然参加美国军事集团和原子战略体系。
    特别值得注意的，是西德和日本加紧经济军事化和扩军备战的活动，都是在这两个国家的军国主义头子的领导下进行的。他们为了从人力上、组织上和思想上积极进行侵略战争的准备，已经公开起用大量法西斯分子，公开发展法西斯组织。西德政府各部门中现有十八万余人是在原希特勒纳粹机关中服务过的。在军队中，现在的一百多名陆海空军高级将领都是希特勒的高级军官。老牌法西斯分子、西德国防部长施特劳斯承认，哪怕是上尉，没有一个不是曾经在希特勒的国防军服务过的。日本政府各部门中也充斥着大量的军国主义分子，军队中将官有76％、校官有50％、尉官有29．8％都是旧法西斯军人。在政府的纵容下，日本和西德旧有的法西斯团体纷纷复活，并出现了不少新的法西斯组织。这些法西斯团体，在组织上正由分散走向集中。他们的活动已由隐蔽走向公开。他们采取各种方法，散布军国主义思想，鼓吹复仇主义情绪。
    好战成性和军国主义传统根深蒂固的西德和日本垄断资本集团，为了争夺市场和势力范围，摆脱经济危机，进行帝国主义扩张，半个世纪以来，曾经连续发动侵略战争。在第二次世界大战中，由于以苏联为主力的世界各国人民的共同努力，包括德国和日本两国人民的努力，反法西斯战争取得了胜利，打垮了德国和日本的法西斯势力。但是它们并不甘心于自己的失败，无时无刻不在图谋东山再起，卷土重来。在波茨坦协定和波茨坦公告中曾经明确规定要根除这两个国家的法西斯势力。只要严格执行这些国际协议，本来完全可能根除法西斯势力，防止军国主义再起。但是，美帝国主义背信弃义，悍然撕毁庄严的国际协议，千方百计地扶植这两个国家的军国主义复活。目前它们已恢复了战争经济基础，正在疯狂地扩军备战，开始策划新战争的阴谋，重新走上了军国主义的老路。帝国主义的特点就是垄断，帝国主义的本性就是侵略和战争。现在的一切事实证明，西德和日本这两个帝国主义的这些本性不但丝毫没有改变，而且比第二次世界大战以前有了新的发展。
    西德和日本成为新战争危险的两个策源地，是美帝国主义大力扶植的结果。
    美国扶植和武装西德、日本，是要把它们作为进攻社会主义阵营、侵略全世界的工具。美帝国主义对外扩张的野心很大，它要独霸全世界，要到处进行侵略，但是它的弱点很多。美帝国主义与社会主义国家和全世界人民为敌，处于十分孤立的地位。它内部矛盾重重，兵力不足，战斗力很弱，而且它与欧、亚、非大陆远隔重洋，运输补给线很长。因此，它为了实现自己的野心，在疯狂地进行扩军备战的同时，就要到处设立军事基地，竭力迫使仆从国家为它充当侵略工具和炮灰。在两次大战中，美国都是自己拿钱让别人出力，怂恿其他帝国主义国家先打起来，自己再参加进去，以收渔人之利。美帝国主义要把西德、日本军国主义扶植起来，作为它发动新战争的帮凶，并不是偶然的。
    美国统治集团从来不隐讳这两个军国主义国家对它将来发动侵略战争时所能起的“特殊作用”，把西德和日本当做美国从欧洲和亚洲进攻社会主义阵营的“前进战略基地”和“堡垒”。艾森豪威尔在担任北大西洋集团总司令期间曾经说过：“作为欧洲地理上的中心，西德对这个大陆有着重大的战略意义”。美国前国防部长麦克耳罗伊于去年10月公开宣称，日本是“我们（美国）在远东的堡垒”。美国统治集团也从不隐讳要把西德和日本的兵士当作炮灰来使用。美国前陆军参谋长柯林斯在1950年就曾说过，“我们（美国）只要供给军火就够了，我们（美国）的孩子不必到欧洲去流血”，他说，“那里有足够的德国人”去为美国打仗。美国前第八军军长艾契伯格也说：“美国兵是历史上费钱最多的军队，但是供养日本军队却很便宜”，“应该研究如何使美国和日本的军队更密切结合成一个整体”。
    同时，美国垄断资本通过扶植和武装日本、西德，还可以攫取巨额利润。美国利用日本恢复和扩张工业需要大量机械设备，特别是利用日本极端缺乏工业原料和粮食的弱点，已经把日本变成美国过剩生产品的一个重要市场。据艾森豪威尔自己承认，美国所以必须扶植日本的原因之一，是日本现在已经成为“仅次于加拿大”的美国的“第二个大主顾”。美国垄断资本通过加速武装西德进行大量的军火投资，美国战后十余年向西德工业投入了约三亿五千万美元，但由于加速武装西德，预计在今后六、七年内就可向西德军火工业投入十亿美元。美国飞机、导弹及其他有关新武器工业的资本家正向西德军事工业投入大量资本，或与西德资本家共同在西德建设新的军火工厂进行合资经营，或购买西德军火公司的股票。美国“洛克希德飞机公司”大量购买西德“南方”飞机工业垄断集团的股票，美国“联合飞机公司”单是从西德克虏伯的一家飞机制造厂“威悉尔飞机制造厂”就已经取得了43％的股份。
    美帝国主义复活西德和日本军国主义，首先是恢复它们的军国主义经济基础。关于这点，美国统治集团也毫不隐讳，比如美国副国务卿狄龙今年2月19日在辛辛那提世界事务委员会主持的国际事务会议上说过：“我们在德国（指西德）和日本的政策特别有效的是，帮助恢复了可以支持民主制度（应读作军国主义制度）的经济基础，很快取得了成功。”
    第二次世界大战结束以后，美国悍然撕毁国际协议，先后数次释放大批罪大恶极的战争罪犯，包括西德的“军火大王”克虏伯和日本现任首相岸信介等垄断资本家、军国主义分子及法西斯军人。在“分散管理”的托词下，美国把西德和日本的垄断资本按照美国的意图，加以改组，实际上是保存了西德和日本的垄断组织。美国还曾数次修改盟国关于西德和日本的赔款计划，赔款的总额一次比一次减少。按规定，应该拆除作赔偿的有关军事生产的工厂，西德有一千八百个，日本有八百五十个；但由于美国的庇护，几乎全部都没有拆除。重工业中可以作为复活军事工业基础的巨大生产能力，全被保存下来了。西德工业生产能力因拆卸而受到损伤的只占8％。1952年4月驻日“盟军总部”正式归还给了日本八百五十个工厂，包括飞机工厂、军火工厂、武器研究所、造船厂等。
    美国还从资金、技术等各方面扶植西德和日本的重工业和军事工业的恢复和发展。由1945年至1958年6月，美国政府对西德的经济援助和贷款，共为五十二亿零七百万美元，其中很大一部分直接用在工业方面。美国还用出让生产“专利权”的方式，扶植西德的军火工业，帮助它们生产各种新式武器。美国通过提供资金、技术、原子燃料等，积极帮助西德发展原子工业，为西德日后生产核武器作准备。为了达到复活西德军火工业的目的，美国不断积极地策划放宽对西德军火生产的限制，大型舰艇生产的限制即将宣布解除，导弹武器生产的限制已开始解除。美国政府对日本的经济援助和贷款，由1945年到1958年6月，共为三十三亿一千四百万美元，其中很大一部分投入电力、钢铁、石油和机械工业中。美国还以出让生产“专利权”等方式向日本提供技术援助，价值约为三亿美元，半数以上集中在机械和电机工业，其次是化学工业和金属工业。最近并将生产F—104超音速喷气飞机的“专利权”让给日本，还要帮助它生产各式导弹。美国在日本进行了大量的军事采购，由1950年7月至1959年12月，共达六十六亿一千九百万美元之巨，对刺激日本军需工业的生产起了重要作用。
    美帝国主义在恢复西德和日本军国主义经济基础的同时，按照预定的阴谋公开地把西德和日本一步一步地重新武装起来。
    第二次世界大战结束后不久，美国占领当局就责成西德法西斯组织“兄弟会”起草武装西德的动员和战略计划。同时在各种“警察”名义的掩饰下，建立西德的武装部队。美国为了便于武装西德，使它取得合法地位，一直在阻挠德国的统一，1949年9月在西方占领区成立波恩政权，到1955年5月更将西德直接纳入北大西洋公约组织，并同西德签订军事协定。从此西德就公开地走上扩军备战的军国主义道路。
    美国占领日本后就进行重新武装日本的活动。美国保留了日本军国主义势力的官僚机构和政治基础。在1948年美国命令日本政府设立“海上保安厅”，以便重建日本的海军。1950年责令日本建立七万五千人的“警察后备队”。同年10月开始解除对法西斯军人和军国主义分子的整肃（剥夺公权），使他们成为“警察后备队”的“骨干”。1951年9月美国与日本签订“安全条约”，赋予日本重整军备的义务。日本于是在1952年设立了“保安厅”——即变相的国防部。1954年3月美国同日本签订“共同防御援助协定”，公开援助日本扩充军事力量。同年日本政府就设立了“防卫厅”和联合参谋部。艾森豪威尔在今年1月向国会的报告中公开承认：“美国已经使日本能够从没有一点军事能力发展到有相当多的陆海空自卫队”。
    西德和日本的军队，是美帝国主义一手装备起来的。据美国国防部发表的材料，美国对西德的军事援助，自1950年度到1959年度，共为九亿一千九百万美元，对日本共为七亿一千一百万美元。西德和日本的官方也承认，它们的军队是完全由美国装备起来的。西德武装部队总监兼参谋总长豪辛格于1959年5月，对美国军事评论家菲利普斯说，四年来西德由美国提供了十亿美元的军事装备，西德军队装备的80％是由美国供应的。根据最近日本垄断资本的组织“日本兵器工业会”的调查：“现在防卫厅的主要武器的98％，是由美国提供的。”
    美国不仅以常规武器供给西德和日本，而且向它们提供现代化武器。美国已对西德现有的三种导弹部队供应了导弹武器，并将继续大量供应。美国已供给日本“响尾蛇”导弹，最近又与日本签订了出售“鞑靼”式舰对空导弹的合同。美国已经为西德训练了二千名导弹部队的骨干，还有一千名正在美国受训。日本已经派遣军官到美国去受操纵导弹和其他核武器的训练，还计划在两年内再派二百五十名赴美国受训。
    上述一系列事实充分证明，帮助西德和日本恢复和发展军国主义的经济基础的，是美帝国主义，把西德和日本重新武装起来的，也是美帝国主义。美帝国主义是使西德和日本这两个国家再度成为战争策源地的罪魁祸首，是世界和平的头号敌人。
    为了进攻社会主义阵营，美帝国主义竭力扶植西德和日本军国主义复活。西德、日本本身从反动的军国主义和复仇主义立场出发，也要求与美国勾结起来，准备侵略苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家。在西德，以阿登纳为首的一群法西斯分子，就一直在叫嚣“收复失地”和“解放”社会主义国家。不久以前，西德国防军和美国驻西德占领军联合举行大规模的原子战争演习，公然以苏联和德意志民主共和国为假想敌人。今年1月，日本与美国签订了以苏联、中国为主要侵略对象的日美军事同盟条约。最近岸信介又公然狂妄表示，“台湾问题不是单纯的中国内政问题”，中国人民如果解放台湾，他“不能无动于衷”。日本军国主义者妄想借助于美国的支持，再次吞并我国领土台湾。事实证明，进攻社会主义阵营是西德、日本与美国的共同阴谋，对此我们必须保持高度的警惕。
    但是必须指出，今天两大阵营力量的对比已发生了根本变化，东风已进一步压倒西风，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营强大无比，整个社会主义阵营的团结坚如磐石。谁要是发动对社会主义国家的战争，除了自寻死亡之外，别无其他结果。面对着这种情况，西德和日本军国主义势力也不得不考虑，贸然向社会主义阵营发动进攻将会遭到怎样的结果。水总是要往低处流的，欺软怕硬是帝国主义的本性。谁能担保被美国扶植起来的西德和日本，一定会恭顺地听从美国的指挥，而不首先把侵略矛头指向资本主义世界，以实现它们的扩张野心呢？这一点，连已故美国国务卿杜勒斯也不能不提出疑问。他在“战争或和平”一书中曾说：“能不能肯定德国人一定朝着我们美国人认为正确的方向进行射击？”
    人们已经愈来愈清楚地看到，美国、西德、日本在反社会主义的反动事业上进行勾结，并不能消除或减轻帝国主义间的矛盾和你死我活的斗争。西德和日本的生产发展，目前在资本主义世界是最快的。但由于战后领土和殖民地的缩小以及人口的减少，它们的市场范围和原料产地都大大缩小，加以战后强大的社会主义阵营和两个平行的世界市场的出现，以及一系列民族主义国家的独立，资本主义世界市场日益缩小，而且已被老牌帝国主义瓜分完毕。因此，它们的生产愈发展，市场问题愈是尖锐，愈要向外扩张，挤入英、法殖民地和要求改变资本主义世界市场被美、英帝国主义垄断的局面。西德和日本的统治集团已经公然提出重新分割资本主义世界势力范围的要求。西德经济部长艾哈德于1958年10月在一次秘密会议中号召西德“必须集中力量于人们讨厌的英国殖民主义的地区”，“挤入各个地区而把英国人踢出去”，从而以马克“代替英镑的地位”。日本岸信介叫嚣：“为了使日本经济建立在稳固的基础上，有必要建立经济圈。为此，特别要把和东南亚的经济合作作为日本的一项长期目标。”这明明是在重温战前“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦，企图重新占领东南亚市场。
    当然，目前西德和日本向西方内部扩张的矛头主要还没有指向美国。在第二次世界大战中遭到惨败的西德和日本统治集团变得更加狡猾了，它们懂得，在美国还可供它们利用的时候，要避免横冲直撞，树敌过多，尤其不要过分刺激美国；而要利用西方内部矛盾特别是美英矛盾，与美国勾结在一起，首先向英、法等老牌帝国主义国家进攻。如在欧洲，西德正在利用美国策划的“统一”欧洲各国经济、军事、政治并最终组成“欧洲联邦”的所谓“欧洲整体化运动”，纠合“小欧洲”六国组成“煤钢联营”、“原子联营”和“共同市场”，与英国展开了争夺市场和霸权的激烈斗争。又如在中间地带，西德和日本通过商品和资本输出、经济和技术“援助”以及政治拉拢等手段，竭力渗入英、法传统地区，严重地打击了英、法利益和削弱了英、法在这些地区的势力。
    但是，西德和日本向资本主义世界的扩张，不能不侵犯到美国的利益，最终必然要和美帝国主义发生正面的冲突。事实上它们与美国的控制和反控制的矛盾已经逐渐显露出来。早在1957年苏联的人造卫星上天，美国在西方的领导地位进一步削弱的时候，西德即乘机和其他西欧国家一起要求与美国分享北大西洋集团的领导权。例如，在1957年10月发表的西德和意大利的会谈公报中就曾经提出，要与美国在“平等基础”上建立“联合政治领导”。此后，西德纠合法、意组成的“欧洲大陆阵线”和“军备三角联盟”，实际上是抵制“美英联合领导”和美、英垄断核武器的手段。日本垄断资本核心组织“经济团体联合会”会长石坂泰三早在1956年就透露日本垄断资本要求独立发展的野心，说要“改变唯美是赖的方针，确立日本独自的方针”。最近日本正在设法改变在重要工业原料70％以上由美国供应的状况，要求转换市场，以摆脱经济上对美国的依赖。在中间地带，西德和日本在打击英、法的同时，也排挤着美国。例如，西德正在加紧向美国的“后院”——拉丁美洲渗入，在拉丁美洲的进口总额中的比重在不断上升，已由1948年的几乎等于零上升到1958年的8．82％，而居第二位。日本也开始向拉丁美洲扩张，正通过移民“建立经济据点”，并通过投资和贷款开办厂矿，扩大出口。
    当前西德和日本两个帝国主义的向外扩张，主要还是经济扩张，这两个帝国主义同其他帝国主义之间的斗争，主要还是争夺原料产地、销售市场和投资场所的斗争。但是当经济扩张不能用通常的手段继续下去的时候，就要诉诸武力，走上军事冲突的道路。列宁曾经指出：“既然势力对比变更了，那末在资本主义制度下，除了用武力来解决矛盾，还有什么别的办法呢？”①两次世界大战的历史和当前的现实，都充分证明了列宁的论断是完全正确的。美帝国主义扶植西德、日本军国主义的反动政策导致帝国主义国家之间发生新战争的可能性是完全存在的。
    美国扶植西德和日本军国主义复活，加深了帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，加深了全世界人民同帝国主义之间的矛盾，首先是西德人民和日本人民同美帝国主义及其走狗——阿登纳和岸信介为代表的反动派之间的矛盾，结果必然是全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的高涨。阿登纳和岸信介顽固地阻碍国际局势的缓和，疯狂地进行战争准备，遭到了全世界人民的强烈反对。日本人民以反对日美军事同盟条约为中心的反美爱国斗争已经坚持了一年多，现在这个斗争正以空前的规模向前发展着。5月19日深夜岸信介竟不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，不顾中国、苏联的严重警告以及世界公正舆论的严正谴责，在国会内用暴力赶走在野党议员，强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，更加激起各阶层群众的愤慨，汹涌澎湃的斗争风暴席卷全国，把日本人民反美爱国的斗争推向了一个新的阶段。最近，南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民也都掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。在美帝国主义殖民统治的脚下，到处都是一触即发的火药桶。连美帝国主义的喉舌“纽约邮报”也不得不承认：“从世界的这一角到另外一角所高举的旗帜和高呼的口号，都不是拥护我们而是反对我们的。”历史从来不是按照反动派的主观愿望发展的。毛泽东同志说得好：“从来的顽固派，所得的结果，总是和他们的愿望相反。他们总是以损人开始，以害己告终。”②美国扶植西德和日本军国主义复活，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。阿登纳和岸信介被美国牵着鼻子走只会加速自己的灭亡。害人者终害己，玩火者必自焚，这正是帝国主义和一切反动派的逻辑，是不以反动派的意志为转移的历史发展规律。
