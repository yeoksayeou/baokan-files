    Jiangsu News: The trade and finance departments of Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, have launched a new upsurge in supporting autumn ripening production in all aspects. As early as late May, based on the characteristics of this year's early autumn ripening crops and high requirements, the county's trade and finance departments held a special meeting to support autumn ripening production, made arrangements in advance, and formulated plans at all levels.

    Recently, the county's 660,000 mu of mid-season rice has been completely planted. In order to ensure the diesel needs of water-lifting machines in the county's farmland irrigation, the head of the trade and finance department personally took command and organized more than 600 cadres to strengthen diesel supply work. This effectively supported the needs of farmland irrigation, and the area of mechanized irrigation expanded by 120,000 mu compared to the original, breaking through the important key to ensuring a bumper autumn harvest.

    In order to ensure fertilizer supply, the commercial department transferred more than 40 purchasing and transportation personnel, concentrated eight large ocean-going ships and more than 20,000 containers, and in the past ten days, it has transported 2.97 million jin of chemical fertilizer to various parts of the county. They also helped various communes to comprehensively arrange labor, so that more than 7,000 local fertilizer factories quickly put into production, which will provide 50 dan of refined local fertilizer per mu of autumn ripening crops. The county's grain departments also seized the opportunity to process rapeseed and rush to produce 5.5 million jin of rapeseed cakes to meet the needs of topdressing.

    In order to prepare for flood prevention, the commercial department also successively transported a large number of flood prevention materials to the dangerous sections along the river and in low-lying areas for immediate needs.

    Currently, more than 10,000 employees in the county's trade and finance system are carrying out the "Eight Goods and Eight More" red flag competition to support a greater bumper autumn harvest. The "Eight Goods and Eight More" are: Organize and supply means of production well, ensure more grain production; provide good material and technical support, ensure more development of sideline occupations; help with financial management and implement diligence and thrift in running the society well, ensure more accumulation for societies and teams; help explore local resources and comprehensive utilization well, ensure more development of community-run industries; help plan and develop production well, ensure that poor teams surpass rich teams more; support the realization of the three agricultural modernizations well, ensure more technological innovation, creation, and invention; manage grain well and arrange the lives of members well, ensure more collective welfare undertakings are done; publicize economic policies well, ensure more procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

    Jiangsu News: The Bufeng Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, arranged and implemented all the means of production for autumn harvest and planting two months in advance. More than 46,000 pieces of various agricultural tools have been arranged and implemented, reaching 135% of the required amount.

    As early as early May, when supporting the high tide of summer harvest and planting, the supply and marketing cooperative mobilized employees to prepare sufficient means of production for autumn harvest and planting two months in advance. At that time, some comrades believed that the summer harvest and planting had not yet ended and that there was still plenty of time, and there was a slack mood. The Party branch mobilized everyone to discuss the question of "whether it is necessary to be early," so that everyone further clarified that in order to support a greater bumper autumn harvest, the means of production must be prepared early.

    After unifying thinking, Comrade Si Jiuqing, the manager of means of production, etc., combined with the central work, went deep into the Yuanwan Production Team to conduct a typical investigation. They adopted methods such as looking at the production site, interviewing cadres, old farmers, holding symposiums, and making calculations to understand the surplus and deficiency of means of production for autumn harvest and planting in the entire commune from point to surface. Based on this situation, they then studied solutions with each brigade separately, formulated specific plans. In addition to the brigade independently solving a part of it, the remaining missing parts were resolved by the supply and marketing cooperative taking measures to help solve them. At present, they have arranged and implemented all the means of production for autumn harvest and planting in the entire commune through industrial and commercial cooperation and multi-party linkages.

    摸情况订规划找货源抓生产
    江阴财贸部门全面支援秋熟生产
    盐城县步凤供销部提前准备秋收秋种农具
    本报讯　江苏省江阴县财贸部门，全面掀起了支援秋熟生产的新高潮。早在5月下旬，这个县的财贸部门就根据今年秋熟作物季节早、要求高的特点，召开了支持秋熟生产的专门会议，提前作了部署，层层制订了规划。
    最近，这个县六十六万亩中稻全部栽种结束。为了保证全县农田灌溉中戽水机的柴油需要，财贸部长亲自挂帅，组织了六百多干部加强柴油供应工作。有效地支持了农田灌溉需要，机灌面积比原来扩大了十二万亩，突破了确保秋熟丰收的重要关键。
    为了保证肥料供应，商业部门抽调了四十多名采购、调运人员，集中了八只出海大船和两万多只容器，十天来就把二百九十七万斤化肥调运到了全县各地；他们还帮助各个公社全面安排劳力，使全县七千多个土化肥厂迅速投入生产，这批工厂将为每亩秋熟作物提供五十担精制的土化肥。全县粮食部门也抓紧时机，加工油菜子，突击生产菜饼五百五十万斤，满足追肥需要。
    为了作好防汛准备，商业部门还将大批防汛物资陆续运到了沿江一带和低洼地区的险要工段，以供随时需要。
    目前，这个县财贸系统的一万多名职工，正在开展支持秋熟更大丰收的“八好八多”红旗竞赛。“八好八多”是：生产资料组织供应好，保证粮食增产多；物资技术支持好，保证副业发展多；帮助财务管理、贯彻勤俭办社好，保证社队增加积累多；帮助挖掘地方资源、综合利用好，社办工业发展多；帮助规划发展生产好，穷队超过富队多；支援实现农业三化好，技术革新创造发明多；粮食管理、社员生活安排好，集体福利事业办得多；经济政策宣传好，农副产品采购多。
    本报讯　江苏省盐城县步凤供销部，提前两个月把秋收秋种生产资料全部安排落实。已经安排落实的各种农具有四万六千多件，达到了需要量的135％。
    还在5月上旬支持夏收夏种高潮的时候，这个供销部就发动职工提前两个月备足秋收秋种生产资料。当时有的同志认为夏收夏种还没结束，时间还早，存在着松劲情绪，党支部就发动大家对“要不要早”的问题进行了讨论，使大家进一步明确了要支持秋熟生产更大丰收，生产资料一定要早作准备。
    在统一思想以后，生产资料经理司九清同志等，结合中心工作，深入袁湾生产队进行典型调查。他们采取了看生产现场、访问干部、老农、开座谈会、排队算账等办法，从点到面地摸清了全公社秋收秋种生产资料余缺情况。根据这个情况，他们再分别和各个大队研究解决办法，订出具体计划，除了大队自力更生地解决一部分外，其余缺少部分，由供销部采取措施，帮助解决。目前，他们已通过工商协作和多方挂钩的办法，把全公社秋收秋种的生产资料全部安排落实。
