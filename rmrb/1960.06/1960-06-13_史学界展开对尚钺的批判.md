    Historical Circles Launch Criticism of Shang Yue

    In recent years, Shang Yue has published a series of fundamentally erroneous views on issues such as academic lines and the nature of Chinese society. Since the beginning of this year, historical circles have launched a criticism of Shang Yue's erroneous thinking.

    Shang Yue's Erroneous Thinking

    As early as 1957, Shang Yue declared in the preface to his book "Research on the Socio-Economic Formations of the Ming and Qing Dynasties" that it was inappropriate to take the Opium War of 1840 as the starting point of modern China. At the same time, he also expressed doubts about the basic views of Marxist classic writers since Marx and Engels on Chinese society, believing that these "traditional views" of Chinese history in historical circles should be changed based on his research on the socio-economic history of the Ming and Qing dynasties. In response to Shang Yue's erroneous views, Liu Danian and Li Shu successively published articles in "Historical Research" to criticize him. They also pointed out that this debate was not just a simple academic issue, but also involved a series of basic issues in the nature of Chinese society and the democratic revolution in the past three hundred years. Shang Yue did not accept these criticisms. In July of last year, Shang Yue published a long article in "Historical Research" entitled "Some Things About the Question of the Sprouts of Capitalism in China," still adhering to his set of private scientific views. Not only that, but later he also published "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" in the Guangming Daily on August 10, 1959, and "Promoting Academic Democracy" and "How Should Chinese Historical Work Leap Forward?" in the Wenhui Daily on October 1 and November 1, 1959, greatly distorting the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, opposing academic criticism, and promoting the revisionist fallacy that ideological struggle in historical circles had been extinguished.

    In response to the above fallacies of Shang Yue, the People's Daily successively published Li Shu's "Hundred Flowers Bloom and Ideological Struggle" and "Is it Marxism-Leninism or Private Science?" on January 26 and February 4 of this year. In these two articles, the author exposed Shang Yue's revisionist viewpoint of obliterating the struggle between the two lines in historical circles under the pretext of "Hundred Flowers Bloom," and focused on criticizing Shang Yue's "private science" system, which was hostile to Marxism-Leninism. "Historical Research," Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, "Teaching and Research," "Theory and Practice," "Jianghai Academic Journal," "History Teaching," "Anhui History Studies," Shandong University Journal, and Xiamen University Journal also successively published articles criticizing Shang Yue's revisionist views and private science. Some academic groups and institutions of higher learning held meetings to criticize Shang Yue's revisionist views. This criticism is currently continuing.

    Criticizing Shang Yue's Revisionist Fallacies

    Many critical articles have exposed Shang Yue's revisionist views. In "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" and "How Should Chinese Historical Work Leap Forward?" Shang Yue argued that both the proletarian and bourgeois ideological systems "are for the pursuit of truth," so the two can only "lead to mutual discussion," seek "common improvement," and "gradually approach each other," until they "gradually approach the truth." Many critical articles pointed out that Shang Yue's view is revisionist and directly opposed to the Party's current academic line. Li Wenhai said in "Adhere to the Party Spirit Principle of Historical Science" (Guangming Daily, February 2) that historical science is a science with a clear Party character. Bourgeois historical science serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, and proletarian historical science serves the interests of the proletariat and all working people. Therefore, Shang Yue's so-called "both ideological systems are for the pursuit of truth" is essentially an attempt to castrate the Party character of historical science. The author believes that the main content of Shang Yue's "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" is nothing more than: advocating that class struggle in ideology should be "harmonized"; propagating that class struggle in the academic field has been "extinguished"; and attempting to reverse the verdict on the criticized bourgeois academic thought. Yu Danchu's "Striving to Implement the Party's 'Hundred Flowers Bloom' Policy in Historical Science" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 4) focused on exposing and criticizing Shang Yue's ugly face as a bourgeois scholar from two aspects. The article first criticized Shang Yue's mistake of distorting "Hundred Flowers Bloom" into the bourgeois so-called "liberalization" policy, pointing out that "Hundred Flowers Bloom" is for the development of Marxist truth. In the process of this pursuit and development, it is impossible not to have the struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism, proletarian and bourgeois ideology. For the proletarian and bourgeois ideological systems, there is no question of who approaches whom, but only the question of who defeats whom. Shang Yue's general talk of "both being for the pursuit of truth" apart from this struggle is essentially an attempt to blur the scientific truth of Marxism, allowing bourgeois ideology to run rampant and freely proliferate. The article also revealed that Shang Yue, on the other hand, firmly opposed the Party's Hundred Flowers Bloom policy and adopted an academic warlord-style, extremely barbaric and unreasonable attitude towards academic criticism. The author sharply refuted Shang Yue's saying that critics should have "equal study," believing that Shang Yue's wanton abuse and intimidation of critics was enough to expose that his private science could not stand criticism. LÃ¼ Zhenyu pointed out in "Historical Science Must Advance on the Basis of Mao Zedong Thought" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 5) that Shang Yue's assertion that there is no longer a struggle between two lines in the current field of historical science in our country is in fact to believe that the transformation of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals not only have no content of class struggle, but are also unnecessary, and even the Party's rectification movement is also unnecessary. Shang Yue's view of confusing class boundaries and denying class struggle is one of the most important contents of modern revisionism and must be fought against irreconcilably. Tian Changwu revealed and criticized Shang Yue's revisionist views in a speech given at Jiangsu Normal College in May 1957 in "Striving to Defend the Party Character of Historical Science" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 5). In this speech, Shang Yue openly attacked the Party's principle that historical science must serve proletarian politics, declaring that using history as a weapon of political struggle would inevitably distort history. The author pointed out that the revolutionary and scientific nature of Marxist historical science are consistent. Opposing the revolutionary nature of historical science to its scientific nature is a common trick used by many reactionary historians to attack Marxism-Leninism. Shang Yue's fallacy fully demonstrates that he is speaking from the bourgeois standpoint and has helped the bourgeois reactionary history.

    Criticizing Shang Yue's Private Science System

    Comrade Mao Zedong made many incisive arguments on Chinese history in his writings on the Chinese revolution, and these arguments are objective truths that have been tested by the practice of the Chinese revolution. However, Shang Yue slandered it as an "old traditional historical system," tried his best to oppose it, and established another set of anti-Marxist private science that was not based on facts. Therefore, many articles pointed out that Shang Yue's private science system is directly opposed to Mao Zedong Thought and must be thoroughly criticized. Jian Bozan pointed out in "'Newly Emerged' Historical System or a Copy of the 'Old Traditional Historical System'?" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 3) that Comrade Mao Zedong, in his book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," correctly explained the laws of the entire development of Chinese history based on the principles of historical materialism and dialectical materialism, and laid an unshakable solid foundation for the development of Marxist-Leninist historical science in China. The historical system established under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is by no means the "old traditional historical system" that Shang Yue said, but a brand-new Marxist-Leninist historical system. As for Shang Yue's so-called "newly emerged" historical system, it is nothing more than the rotten and unbearable remnants of the bourgeoisie found in the garbage heap. Sun Wenliang believed in "Two or Three Fallacies in Shang Yue's Article 'Some Things About the Question of the Sprouts of Capitalism in China'" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 4) that Shang Yue's article was an unprincipled article and a programmatic document that distorted modern Chinese history according to Shang Yue's views. "The reason why it is unprincipled is that it cuts off Comrade Mao Zedong's works to accommodate Comrade Shang Yue's private scientific views, and nakedly attacks the most basic views of Marxism-Leninism on Chinese history; the reason why it is a programmatic document is that it makes the most far-fetched interpretation of modern Chinese history from both theoretical and factual aspects." Sun Wenliang's article focused on criticizing Shang Yue's distortion of the fundamental views of the classic writers on the nature of modern Chinese society. The article pointed out with powerful arguments that Shang Yue's first fallacy was to distort Comrade Mao Zedong's view that the Opium War began the preparatory stage of the Chinese democratic revolution into the beginning of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution, and must find an economic basis for it. However, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution began with the Xinhai Revolution, and the Opium War was nothing more than the preparatory stage for the beginning of this revolution. It is tantamount to saying that foreigners attacking China must also begin to gradually grow new economic factors within Chinese society before they start, otherwise they would be too lazy to attack. The article also criticized Shang Yue for arbitrarily distorting the bourgeois democratic movement into the workers' movement, and for trying by all means to avoid Marx's name to attack his views. The author believes that Shang Yue's attack shows that he has decided to break with Marxism.

    In addition, some articles have revealed and criticized Shang Yue for often cutting off classic works, distorting historical materials, and subjective speculation in order to implement his erroneous views and other bad academic styles. (Bing Ran)
