    Historical Circles Launch Criticism of Shang Yue

    In recent years, Shang Yue has published a series of fundamentally erroneous views on issues such as academic lines and the nature of Chinese society. Since the beginning of this year, historical circles have launched a criticism of Shang Yue's erroneous thinking.

    Shang Yue's Erroneous Thinking

    As early as 1957, Shang Yue declared in the preface to his book "Research on the Socio-Economic Formations of the Ming and Qing Dynasties" that it was inappropriate to take the Opium War of 1840 as the starting point of modern China. At the same time, he also expressed doubts about the basic views of Marxist classic writers since Marx and Engels on Chinese society, believing that these "traditional views" of Chinese history in historical circles should be changed based on his research on the socio-economic history of the Ming and Qing dynasties. In response to Shang Yue's erroneous views, Liu Danian and Li Shu successively published articles in "Historical Research" to criticize him. They also pointed out that this debate was not just a simple academic issue, but also involved a series of basic issues in the nature of Chinese society and the democratic revolution in the past three hundred years. Shang Yue did not accept these criticisms. In July of last year, Shang Yue published a long article in "Historical Research" entitled "Some Things About the Question of the Sprouts of Capitalism in China," still adhering to his set of private scientific views. Not only that, but later he also published "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" in the Guangming Daily on August 10, 1959, and "Promoting Academic Democracy" and "How Should Chinese Historical Work Leap Forward?" in the Wenhui Daily on October 1 and November 1, 1959, greatly distorting the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, opposing academic criticism, and promoting the revisionist fallacy that ideological struggle in historical circles had been extinguished.

    In response to the above fallacies of Shang Yue, the People's Daily successively published Li Shu's "Hundred Flowers Bloom and Ideological Struggle" and "Is it Marxism-Leninism or Private Science?" on January 26 and February 4 of this year. In these two articles, the author exposed Shang Yue's revisionist viewpoint of obliterating the struggle between the two lines in historical circles under the pretext of "Hundred Flowers Bloom," and focused on criticizing Shang Yue's "private science" system, which was hostile to Marxism-Leninism. "Historical Research," Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, "Teaching and Research," "Theory and Practice," "Jianghai Academic Journal," "History Teaching," "Anhui History Studies," Shandong University Journal, and Xiamen University Journal also successively published articles criticizing Shang Yue's revisionist views and private science. Some academic groups and institutions of higher learning held meetings to criticize Shang Yue's revisionist views. This criticism is currently continuing.

    Criticizing Shang Yue's Revisionist Fallacies

    Many critical articles have exposed Shang Yue's revisionist views. In "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" and "How Should Chinese Historical Work Leap Forward?" Shang Yue argued that both the proletarian and bourgeois ideological systems "are for the pursuit of truth," so the two can only "lead to mutual discussion," seek "common improvement," and "gradually approach each other," until they "gradually approach the truth." Many critical articles pointed out that Shang Yue's view is revisionist and directly opposed to the Party's current academic line. Li Wenhai said in "Adhere to the Party Spirit Principle of Historical Science" (Guangming Daily, February 2) that historical science is a science with a clear Party character. Bourgeois historical science serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, and proletarian historical science serves the interests of the proletariat and all working people. Therefore, Shang Yue's so-called "both ideological systems are for the pursuit of truth" is essentially an attempt to castrate the Party character of historical science. The author believes that the main content of Shang Yue's "Studying Solidly and Upholding the Truth" is nothing more than: advocating that class struggle in ideology should be "harmonized"; propagating that class struggle in the academic field has been "extinguished"; and attempting to reverse the verdict on the criticized bourgeois academic thought. Yu Danchu's "Striving to Implement the Party's 'Hundred Flowers Bloom' Policy in Historical Science" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 4) focused on exposing and criticizing Shang Yue's ugly face as a bourgeois scholar from two aspects. The article first criticized Shang Yue's mistake of distorting "Hundred Flowers Bloom" into the bourgeois so-called "liberalization" policy, pointing out that "Hundred Flowers Bloom" is for the development of Marxist truth. In the process of this pursuit and development, it is impossible not to have the struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism, proletarian and bourgeois ideology. For the proletarian and bourgeois ideological systems, there is no question of who approaches whom, but only the question of who defeats whom. Shang Yue's general talk of "both being for the pursuit of truth" apart from this struggle is essentially an attempt to blur the scientific truth of Marxism, allowing bourgeois ideology to run rampant and freely proliferate. The article also revealed that Shang Yue, on the other hand, firmly opposed the Party's Hundred Flowers Bloom policy and adopted an academic warlord-style, extremely barbaric and unreasonable attitude towards academic criticism. The author sharply refuted Shang Yue's saying that critics should have "equal study," believing that Shang Yue's wanton abuse and intimidation of critics was enough to expose that his private science could not stand criticism. Lü Zhenyu pointed out in "Historical Science Must Advance on the Basis of Mao Zedong Thought" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 5) that Shang Yue's assertion that there is no longer a struggle between two lines in the current field of historical science in our country is in fact to believe that the transformation of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals not only have no content of class struggle, but are also unnecessary, and even the Party's rectification movement is also unnecessary. Shang Yue's view of confusing class boundaries and denying class struggle is one of the most important contents of modern revisionism and must be fought against irreconcilably. Tian Changwu revealed and criticized Shang Yue's revisionist views in a speech given at Jiangsu Normal College in May 1957 in "Striving to Defend the Party Character of Historical Science" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 5). In this speech, Shang Yue openly attacked the Party's principle that historical science must serve proletarian politics, declaring that using history as a weapon of political struggle would inevitably distort history. The author pointed out that the revolutionary and scientific nature of Marxist historical science are consistent. Opposing the revolutionary nature of historical science to its scientific nature is a common trick used by many reactionary historians to attack Marxism-Leninism. Shang Yue's fallacy fully demonstrates that he is speaking from the bourgeois standpoint and has helped the bourgeois reactionary history.

    Criticizing Shang Yue's Private Science System

    Comrade Mao Zedong made many incisive arguments on Chinese history in his writings on the Chinese revolution, and these arguments are objective truths that have been tested by the practice of the Chinese revolution. However, Shang Yue slandered it as an "old traditional historical system," tried his best to oppose it, and established another set of anti-Marxist private science that was not based on facts. Therefore, many articles pointed out that Shang Yue's private science system is directly opposed to Mao Zedong Thought and must be thoroughly criticized. Jian Bozan pointed out in "'Newly Emerged' Historical System or a Copy of the 'Old Traditional Historical System'?" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 3) that Comrade Mao Zedong, in his book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," correctly explained the laws of the entire development of Chinese history based on the principles of historical materialism and dialectical materialism, and laid an unshakable solid foundation for the development of Marxist-Leninist historical science in China. The historical system established under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is by no means the "old traditional historical system" that Shang Yue said, but a brand-new Marxist-Leninist historical system. As for Shang Yue's so-called "newly emerged" historical system, it is nothing more than the rotten and unbearable remnants of the bourgeoisie found in the garbage heap. Sun Wenliang believed in "Two or Three Fallacies in Shang Yue's Article 'Some Things About the Question of the Sprouts of Capitalism in China'" ("Historical Research" 1960, No. 4) that Shang Yue's article was an unprincipled article and a programmatic document that distorted modern Chinese history according to Shang Yue's views. "The reason why it is unprincipled is that it cuts off Comrade Mao Zedong's works to accommodate Comrade Shang Yue's private scientific views, and nakedly attacks the most basic views of Marxism-Leninism on Chinese history; the reason why it is a programmatic document is that it makes the most far-fetched interpretation of modern Chinese history from both theoretical and factual aspects." Sun Wenliang's article focused on criticizing Shang Yue's distortion of the fundamental views of the classic writers on the nature of modern Chinese society. The article pointed out with powerful arguments that Shang Yue's first fallacy was to distort Comrade Mao Zedong's view that the Opium War began the preparatory stage of the Chinese democratic revolution into the beginning of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution, and must find an economic basis for it. However, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution began with the Xinhai Revolution, and the Opium War was nothing more than the preparatory stage for the beginning of this revolution. It is tantamount to saying that foreigners attacking China must also begin to gradually grow new economic factors within Chinese society before they start, otherwise they would be too lazy to attack. The article also criticized Shang Yue for arbitrarily distorting the bourgeois democratic movement into the workers' movement, and for trying by all means to avoid Marx's name to attack his views. The author believes that Shang Yue's attack shows that he has decided to break with Marxism.

    In addition, some articles have revealed and criticized Shang Yue for often cutting off classic works, distorting historical materials, and subjective speculation in order to implement his erroneous views and other bad academic styles. (Bing Ran)

    史学界展开对尚钺的批判
    近几年来，尚钺对于学术路线和中国社会性质等问题，发表了一系列带有根本性错误的看法。今年以来史学界对尚钺的错误思想展开了批判。
    尚钺的错误思想
    早在1957年，尚钺就在“明清社会经济形态的研究”一书的序言中宣称，中国近代以1840年鸦片战争作为起点是不妥当的。同时他还对马克思和恩格斯以来的马克思主义经典作家关于中国社会的一些基本观点表示怀疑，认为史学界对中国历史的这些“传统看法”都要根据他的关于明清社会经济史的研究而改变。针对尚钺这种错误观点，当时，刘大年和黎澍曾先后在“历史研究”发表文章进行批判。他们并且指出，这场论争不仅是一个简单的学术问题，它还涉及近三百年中国社会性质和民主主义革命中一系列的基本问题。尚钺没有接受这些批评。去年7月，尚钺又在“历史研究”上发表了一篇题为“有关中国资本主义萌芽问题的二三事”的长文，仍然坚持他那一套私人科学观点。不仅如此，后来他又在1959年8月10日光明日报上发表了“踏实钻研与坚持真理”，在1959年10月1日和11月1日文汇报上发表了“发扬学术民主”和“中国史学工作应如何跃进？”等文章，大肆歪曲“百家争鸣”的方针，反对学术批评，宣扬史学界思想斗争已经熄灭的修正主义谬论。
    针对尚钺以上种种谬论，今年1月26日和2月4日，人民日报先后发表了黎澍的“百家争鸣和思想斗争”和“是马克思列宁主义还是私人科学？”两篇文章。在这两篇文章中，作者揭露了尚钺借口“百家争鸣”抹煞史学界两条道路斗争的修正主义观点，并且着重批判了尚钺的与马克思列宁主义相敌对的“私人科学”体系。“历史研究”、光明日报、文汇报、“教学与研究”、“理论与实践”、“江海学刊”、“历史教学”“安徽史学”、山东大学学报和厦门大学学报等报刊，也先后发表了批判尚钺的修正主义观点和私人科学的文章。有的学术团体和高等院校举行了批判尚钺修正主义观点的会议。目前这个批判在继续开展中。
    批判尚钺的修正主义谬论
    许多批判文章揭露了尚钺的修正主义观点。尚钺在“踏实钻研与坚持真理”和“中国史学工作应如何跃进？”两文中认为，无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想体系“都是为着追求真理”，因此，两者只有“引向互相商讨”，求取“共同提高”，才能“逐渐接近起来”，以至“逐渐接近于真理”。许多批判文章指出，尚钺的这种观点是修正主义的，并且是与当前党的学术路线针锋相对的。李文海在“坚持历史科学的党性原则”一文（2月2日光明日报）中说，历史科学是一门具有鲜明党性的科学。资产阶级历史学为资产阶级的利益服务，无产阶级历史学为无产阶级和全体劳动人民的利益服务。因此，尚钺所谓两种思想体系“都是为着追求真理”云云，其实质就是企图阉割历史科学的党性。作者认为，尚钺的“踏实钻研与坚持真理”一文的主要内容不外乎：主张意识形态学上的阶级斗争应该“调和”；宣扬学术领域内的阶级斗争已经“熄灭”；企图为被批判的资产阶级学术思想翻案。俞旦初在“为在历史科学中贯彻党的‘百家争鸣’政策而斗争”一文（“历史研究”1960年第四期）中着重从两方面揭发和批判了尚钺的资产阶级学者的丑恶面目。文章首先批判了尚钺把“百家争鸣”曲解为资产阶级的所谓“自由化”的政策的错误，指出“百家争鸣”是为了发展马克思主义的真理。在这种追求和发展的过程中，不可能没有马克思主义和反马克思主义、无产阶级和资产阶级思想的斗争。对于无产阶级和资产阶级思想体系来说，没有谁接近谁，只有谁战胜谁的问题。尚钺离开这种斗争，笼统地谈什么“都是为着追求真理”，实质上是企图模糊马克思主义的科学真理，让资产阶级思想畅行无阻，自由泛滥。文章还揭露了尚钺在另一方面又坚决地反对党的百家争鸣政策，对学术批评采取了学阀式的极端横蛮无理的态度。作者尖锐地驳斥了尚钺所谓批评者应有“同等钻研”的说法，认为尚钺对批评者肆意谩骂，实行恐吓，适足以暴露他的私人科学是经不住批评的。吕振羽在“历史科学必须在毛泽东思想的基础上前进”一文（“历史研究”1960年第五期）中指出，尚钺断定在我国目前的历史科学领域已经没有两条道路斗争的存在，这在实际上就是认为资产阶级的改造、资产阶级知识分子的改造不只都没有阶级斗争的内容，而且都是不必要了，甚至党的整风运动也是不必要了。尚钺的混淆阶级界限和否认阶级斗争的观点，正是现代修正主义的一个最重要的内容，必须和它进行不调和的斗争。田昌五在“为保卫历史科学的党性而斗争”一文（“历史研究”1960年第五期）中，揭露和批判了1957年5月尚钺在江苏师范学院所作一次讲话中的修正主义观点。在这篇讲话中，尚钺公开地攻击历史科学必须为无产阶级政治服务的党性原则，宣称把历史学当作政治斗争的武器就必然歪曲历史。作者指出，马克思主义历史科学的革命性和科学性是一致的。把历史科学的革命性和它的科学性对立起来，这正是许多反动史学家攻击马克思列宁主义的惯技。尚钺的这种谬论充分地表现了他是站在资产阶级立场上讲话，替资产阶级的反动历史学作了帮手。
    批判尚钺的私人科学体系
    毛泽东同志在他的关于中国革命的著作中，对中国历史作过许多精辟的论断，这些论断是经过中国革命实践检验过的客观真理。但是，尚钺污蔑它是“旧的传统史学体系”，极力加以反对，并另外建立一套不以事实为依据的、反马克思主义的私人科学。因此，许多文章指出，尚钺的私人科学体系是直接与毛泽东思想相对抗的，必须彻底加以批判。翦伯赞在“‘新冒出来’的史学体系还是‘旧的传统史学体系’的翻版？”一文（“历史研究”1960年第三期）中指出，毛泽东同志在“中国革命与中国共产党”一书中，依据历史唯物主义与辩证唯物主义的原理正确地阐明了全部中国历史发展的规律，替马克思列宁主义历史学在中国的发展奠定了不可动摇的坚实的基础。在毛泽东思想指导之下建立的历史体系决不是尚钺所说的是“旧的传统史学体系”，而是崭新的马克思列宁主义史学体系。至于尚钺所谓“新冒出来”的史学体系，不过是从垃圾堆里找出来的腐烂不堪的资产阶级的残滓而已。孙文良在“尚钺‘有关中国资本主义萌芽问题的二三事’一文中的二三谬误”一文（“历史研究”1960年第四期）中，认为尚钺的文章是一篇毫无原则的文章，又是一个按照尚钺观点曲解近代中国历史的纲领性的文件。“其所以毫无原则，就是因为它割裂毛泽东同志的著作来迁就尚钺同志的私人科学观点，并且赤裸裸地对马克思列宁主义关于中国历史的最基本的观点进行攻击；其所以是一个纲领性的文件，就是因为它从理论和事实两方面对近代中国历史作了最牵强的解释。”孙文良的文章着重批判了尚钺对经典作家关于中国近代社会性质的根本观点的歪曲。文章用有力的论据指出尚钺的首先一个谬误是，把毛泽东同志关于鸦片战争开始中国民主革命准备阶段的观点曲解为鸦片战争是中国资产阶级民主革命的开始，一定要替它找个资产阶级的经济基础来。可是中国的资产阶级民主革命是从辛亥革命开始的，鸦片战争无非是开始这个革命的准备阶段。一定要替鸦片战争在中国找资产阶级的经济基础，这就无异说，外国人打中国还必须中国社会内部开始逐渐生长新的经济因素才动手，否则他们连打也懒得打了。文章还批判了尚钺任意曲解资产阶级民主运动为工人运动，以及不择手段地企图避开马克思的名字来对他的观点进行攻击。作者认为，尚钺的这种攻击表明他已下决心同马克思主义决裂。
    此外，还有些文章揭发和批判尚钺为了贯彻他的错误观点，经常割裂经典著作曲解史料和主观臆断等恶劣学风。　（炳然）
