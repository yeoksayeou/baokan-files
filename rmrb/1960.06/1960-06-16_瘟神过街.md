    The Plague God Crosses the Street
    I. Preparing for the Aftermath
    Hearing that they'll be beaten first, and then everyone will worry. Business is booming again in the White House, and life insurance is thriving. This trip is hard to predict, so it's important to prepare for the aftermath. A volcano erupts, and waves surge. How many layers of insurance can protect us!?

    瘟神过街
    一、预办后事
    听说先行挨揍，后行个个担心，白宫生意又翻新，人寿保险旺盛。此行吉凶难料，先办后事要紧。火山爆发浪奔腾，能保几重险境！？
