Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: Members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TAIWAN Democratic League) local organizations and Taiwanese compatriots residing in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Lüda, and other places have held gatherings in the past two days, angrily condemning the American imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas" and their attempt to permanently occupy our country's territory of Taiwan. They expressed their determination to strengthen the struggle and drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

More than 70 people, including members of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the TAIWAN Democratic League and other democratic parties' local organizations, former Kuomintang military and government personnel, Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai, and family members of Taiwan Chiang gang military and government personnel in Shanghai, held a meeting on the afternoon of the 27th. Xie Xuetang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said at the meeting that American imperialism has occupied Taiwan for ten years, turning Taiwan into a living hell. Currently, it is stepping up its promotion of the "isolating Taiwan" conspiracy, attempting to achieve "trusteeship of Taiwan." However, Taiwanese compatriots, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, know how to deal with American imperialism, and they will unite with the people of the motherland to drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan. Zhao Zukang, Vice Mayor of Shanghai and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said at the meeting that the American imperialists' rule over Taiwan is the root of the disaster and suffering of the Taiwanese people. Recently, Eisenhower, the head of American imperialism, visited Taiwan again to continue his conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and attempt to further turn Taiwan into a colony of American imperialism, which the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate. Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai, Wu Dingfu, Ye Luyun, Liu Lizhang, and others, said that the Taiwanese people have learned from their long-term anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle that only by uniting with the people of the motherland to resolutely and thoroughly drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan is their only bright path. Former Kuomintang military and government personnel and family members of Taiwan Chiang gang military and government personnel in Shanghai expressed in their speeches their hope that Taiwan Chiang gang military and government personnel would unite with the people of the motherland to drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

Members of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League and Taiwanese compatriots in Guangzhou held a meeting on the eve of the tenth anniversary of American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan. Lin Donghai, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said at the meeting that Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, and we resolutely oppose American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan, and resolutely oppose all evil conspiracies of American imperialism to create "two Chinas," "trusteeship of Taiwan," and "Taiwan independence." Liberating Taiwan is the unwavering will of the people of our country, and American imperialism must get out of Taiwan. Qiu Lin, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said that the American imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and engage in "Taiwan autonomy" will definitely be met with a shameful defeat under the resolute opposition of the 650 million Chinese people.

Chen Weizan, a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said that the American aggressors are running rampant in our hometown, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and one day we will make them pay their blood debts. Huang Ming, a member of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said that today's China is no longer the old China that was poor, weak, and arbitrarily subjected to slaughter, but a strong new China that stands tall. The American imperialists' conspiracy to permanently occupy Taiwan will inevitably be met with a shameful defeat. Lin Jinxiu, a Taiwanese woman, said with confidence that our victorious red flag will surely fly on the top of Yushan, Taiwan's high mountain. Lü Wencong, a Taiwanese student at Jinan University who left Taiwan in 1956, exposed the crimes committed by American imperialism in Taiwan and talked about the anti-American and patriotic struggles of the heroic Taiwanese youth and people. He said that anti-American leaflets have appeared in many places in Taiwan. There have also been more than one incident of Taiwanese youth beating up American aggressor soldiers. He said that the Taiwanese people will never allow American imperialism to do whatever it wants, and the Chinese people must drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.

At a meeting held by the Lüda Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League on the 26th, Chen Wen, Chairman of the Lüda Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said that American imperialism's armed occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan at the same time as launching the war of aggression against Korea was an attempt to use Korea and Taiwan as springboards to invade our mainland and further achieve its despicable goal of occupying all of Asia. However, the facts of the past ten years have fully demonstrated that this conspiracy of American imperialism can never be realized. Chen Wen called on patriotic military personnel, civilians, and compatriots in Taiwan to unite with the people of the motherland, be consistent externally, and drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan. Lu Shuxian, a female member of the TAIWAN Democratic League, said that Taiwan, under the occupation of American imperialism, has become a living hell, with workers unemployed, farmers losing their land, and women forced into prostitution. We must settle this blood debt with American imperialism. Qiu Baoyun, a member of the Lüda Municipal Branch of the TAIWAN Democratic League and a lecturer at Dalian Medical College, said that the Taiwanese compatriots, backed by the strong people of the motherland, will surely drive American imperialism out, and Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the motherland.

    上海广州旅大台盟成员和台籍同胞纷表决心
    和全国人民一起把美帝赶出台湾
    据新华社28日讯　上海、广州、旅大等地的台湾民主自治同盟地方组织成员和居住在当地的台湾籍同胞，这两天纷纷举行集会，愤怒谴责美帝国主义阴谋制造“两个中国”、妄图长期霸占我国领土台湾的罪行，表示决心加强斗争，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。
    上海市台盟和其它民主党派地方组织人士、前国民党军政人员、在上海的台湾籍同胞以及台湾蒋帮军政人员在上海的家属等七十多人，27日下午举行了集会。台盟上海市支部主任委员谢雪堂在会上说，美帝国主义侵占台湾十年来，把台湾变成了人间地狱，目前它又在加紧推行“孤立台湾”的阴谋活动，企图达到“托管台湾”。但是，富有反帝爱国斗争传统的台湾同胞是懂得怎样对付美帝国主义的，他们一定会和祖国人民一起，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。上海市副市长、民革上海市委主任委员赵祖康在会上说，美帝国主义对台湾的统治是台湾人民灾难和痛苦的根源。最近美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔又到台湾活动，继续进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，企图进一步变台湾为美帝国主义的殖民地，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。台湾是我国的神圣领土，我们一定要解放台湾。在上海的台湾籍同胞吴丁福、叶绿云、刘立章等人说，台湾人民从长期的反帝爱国斗争中体会到，只有和祖国人民一起坚决彻底地把美国侵略者赶出台湾，才是他们唯一光明的道路。在上海的前国民党军政人员和台湾蒋帮军政人员的家属们在发言中，希望台湾蒋帮军政人员同祖国人民一起，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。
    台盟广州市支部成员和在广州的台湾籍同胞，在美帝国主义侵占台湾十周年前夕举行了集会。台盟广州市支部主任委员林东海在会上说，台湾是我国神圣的领土，我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵占台湾，坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”，“托管台湾”和“台湾独立”等一切罪恶阴谋。解放台湾是我国人民坚定不移的意志，美帝国主义必须滚出台湾去。台盟广州市支部副主任委员丘琳说，美帝国主义制造“两个中国”，搞什么“台湾自治”的阴谋，在六亿五千万中国人民的坚决反对下，肯定要遭到可耻的失败。
    台盟广州市支部委员陈维赞说，美国侵略者在我们的故乡横行霸道，干尽了坏事，总有一天我们要它清还血债。台盟盟员黄明说，今天的中国已不是过去贫穷弱小、任意受人宰割的旧中国，而是巍然屹立的强大的新中国。美帝国主义企图长期霸占台湾的阴谋，必定会遭到可耻的失败。台湾籍妇女林锦秀充满信心地说，我们胜利的红旗，一定能够在台湾的高山——玉山顶上飘扬。1956年才离开台湾的暨南大学台湾籍学生吕文聪，揭露了美帝国主义在台湾犯下的罪行，谈到了英勇的台湾青年和人民进行反美爱国斗争的情况。他说，在台湾许多地方，都出现了反美的传单。还不止一次地发生过台湾青年痛打行凶的美国侵略兵的事情。他说，台湾人民绝对不容许美帝国主义为非作歹，中国人民一定要把美帝国主义赶出台湾。
    在台盟旅大市支部26日举行的集会上，台盟旅大市支部主任委员陈文说，美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时武装侵占了我国领土台湾，是企图以朝鲜和台湾作为跳板侵略我国大陆，并进而达到它霸占全亚洲的卑鄙目的。但是十年来的事实已充分说明，美帝国主义这个阴谋是永远实现不了的。陈文号召台湾爱国军民同胞同祖国人民团结起来，一致对外，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。台盟女盟员卢淑贤说，台湾在美帝国主义的霸占下，变成了人间地狱，工人失业，农民失去了土地，妇女被迫沦为娼妓。我们一定要同美帝国主义算清这笔血债。台盟旅大市支部委员、大连医学院讲师丘宝云说，有强大祖国人民作后盾的台湾同胞，一定会把美帝国主义赶出去，台湾一定会回到祖国的怀抱。
