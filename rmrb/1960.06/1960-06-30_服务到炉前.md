    Service to the Furnace Front
    More than 6,000 employees on the financial and trade front in the Tiexi District of Anshan have launched a campaign to support the battle to seize steel. Employees of the Tiexi Department Store Daily Necessities Store, led by the manager and chairman of the union, used 64 handcarts to deliver 37 kinds of goods to the steelmaking plant, ironmaking plant, and Anshan Iron and Steel Supply Department. The non-staple food store organized salespersons and cadres to go to the countryside to help vegetable cooperatives sort out vegetables, increasing the variety of vegetables supplied threefold. Catering employees, in order to ensure that steelworkers were well-fed, proposed: "We will make whatever the customers want to eat, and guarantee that they can eat whenever they arrive." They also increased the number of side dishes from five to eighteen.

    服务到炉前
    鞍山铁西区财贸战线六千多名职工，掀起了支援夺钢大战的热潮。铁西百货日用杂品商店职工在经理、工会主席的率领下，用六十四台手推车，将三十七种物品送到炼钢厂、炼铁厂和鞍钢供应处，副食品商店组织营业员与干部下乡帮助蔬菜社整理蔬菜，使蔬菜供应品种增加了三倍。饮食业职工为了让钢铁工人吃饱吃好，提出：“顾客吃什么、我们就做什么，保证随到随吃。”并将小菜由五种增加到十八种。
