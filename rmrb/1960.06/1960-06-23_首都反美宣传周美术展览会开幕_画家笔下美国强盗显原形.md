Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The capital's art exhibition "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace" opened this morning at the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

    The nearly two hundred works on display, including cartoons, traditional Chinese paintings, prints, sketches, propaganda posters, and sculptures, focus on exposing the warmongering nature of American imperialism and the various ugly forms of its running dogs, including modern revisionism. They also demonstrate that the people of our country and peace-loving people all over the world are united to defend world peace and severely strike at the American imperialist robbers and their leader, Eisenhower.

    Wu Zuoren, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association and President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said in his opening speech: Our art circles must, like the artillerymen on the Fujian front, bravely take up the weapon of the paintbrush and encircle and suppress American imperialism from all sides, exposing the imperialist war conspiracies and the faces of revisionism before the whole world. He said, "Every painting on display is a shell that strikes American imperialism."

    Wu Zuoren said: For a century, American imperialism has endlessly robbed and stolen from China, riding roughshod over the Chinese people. This debt of hatred is endless. All 650 million people in China resolutely oppose the American imperialist plot to create "Two Chinas," are determined to liberate Taiwan, and firmly support the people of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against American imperialism. He pointed out that while American imperialism is bent on putting shackles on the necks of others, the noose that the people of the world are putting around the neck of American imperialism is actually tightening, and it will eventually be strangled to death.

    Guo Moruo, Qian Junrui, Shao Lizi, Chen Banding, Hua Junwu, and other figures from all walks of life in the capital attended the opening ceremony. Diplomatic officials from various countries' embassies in China and peace activists in Beijing also attended the opening ceremony.

    The paintings on display were magnificent and filled the entire hall. The vast majority are new works by art workers in the capital. The authors used their brushes as sharp weapons to vividly depict the faces of the imperialist robbers; with ingenious ideas, they painted the various evil deeds and farces of the aggressors and their running dogs. When Guo Moruo and a group of visitors stopped in front of a cartoon by Cao Zhenfeng, they couldn't help but laugh. It turned out that Eisenhower's cheeks in the picture were swollen into two large blisters by the people of Asia, and the title humorously read "A Great Harvest!" Guo Moruo said with a smile, "This title should be written bigger!" The cartoon "Dialogue After the Asian Storm" recently painted by the famous cartoonist Hua Junwu also received praise from the visitors. In the picture, Eisenhower, returning from his "visit" to Asia, said to the modern revisionist, who had already lost his head, in a state of embarrassment, "My peaceful cloak has been blown away, where is your face?" The other party replied, "It was blown away long ago," leaving only a tattered bag in his arm, still labeled with the words "Peaceful Cooperation." A portrait of Eisenhower by Hong Huang made the audience laugh. The American president was riding a skinny horse with his head hanging down, with a line of ancient Chinese poetry commenting: "An old road, a west wind, a skinny horse, the sun sets in the west, a heartbroken man at the end of the world."

    In stark contrast to these scenes of "the enemy rotting day by day" are many paintings showing the people of socialist countries and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America standing together, demonstrating the great power to defend world peace and fight against imperialism. In the huge propaganda poster "Oppressed People of the World Unite to Overthrow American Imperialism," the audience saw people of all ethnic groups on the earth forming a powerful and overwhelming force, while the American imperialist robbers fled in panic. "Storm of the Japanese People" is a sketch that vividly depicts the heroic scene of the Japanese people's demonstration in the streets of Tokyo. In addition, works such as "Anti-Imperialist Struggle Suite" and "Eisenhower! Go Home! Fire!" all show that the surging tide of the Chinese people and the people of the world against imperialist aggression is surging and rising.

### 首都反美宣传周美术展览会开幕  画家笔下美国强盗显原形

    首都反美宣传周美术展览会开幕
    画家笔下美国强盗显原形
    新华社22日讯　首都“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平”美术展览会今天上午在中央美术学院举行开幕式。
    展出的近两百幅漫画、彩墨、版画、素描、宣传画以及雕塑等作品，集中揭露了美帝国主义的好战本性，以及它的走狗包括现代修正主义的各种丑态，同时也显示了我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一起，为了保卫世界和平，狠狠痛击美帝国主义强盗和它的头子艾森豪威尔。
    中国美术家协会副主席、中央美术学院院长吴作人在开幕词中说：我们美术界要和福建前线炮兵一样，英勇拿起画笔这个武器，向美帝国主义四面围剿，在全世界面前揭露帝国主义的战争阴谋和修正主义的嘴脸。他说：“展出的每一幅画都是痛击美帝国主义的炮弹”。
    吴作人说：一个世纪以来，美帝国主义对中国无休止的明抢暗偷，骑在中国人民头上作威作福，这笔仇恨的账罄竹难书。全中国六亿五千万人民坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，一定要解放台湾，并坚决支持日本、朝鲜、越南人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反对美帝国主义斗争。他指出，美帝国主义一心想把枷锁套在别人脖子上，实际上是全世界人民套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索正愈套愈紧，终于要把它绞死。
    参加开幕式的，有郭沫若、钱俊瑞、邵力子、陈半丁、华君武等首都各界人士。各国驻华大使馆的外交官员以及在京的各国和平人士参加了开幕式。
    展出的画幅洋洋大观，布满全厅。这里绝大多数是首都美术工作者的新作。作者们以画笔作锋利的武器，淋漓尽致地刻划出帝国主义强盗面貌；以巧妙的构思绘下了侵略者和它的走狗的种种凶行和丑剧。当郭沫若和一批参观者停步在曹振峰作的一幅漫画前时，不禁哈哈大笑。原来画面上的艾森豪威尔两颊被亚洲人民揍成两个大疱，画题幽默地标出“收获大大的！”郭老笑着说：“这个标题应该写得大些！”著名漫画家华君武昨天刚画出的“亚洲风暴后的对话”，也得到参观者赞赏。画面上的艾森豪威尔从亚洲“访问”回来，狼狈地对已经没有脑袋的现代修正主义者说：“我的和平外衣全给刮跑了，你的脸呢？”对方回答：“早就刮没了”，只剩下臂弯里挟的一只破皮包，还标着什么“和平合作”字样。洪荒画的一幅艾森豪威尔像，使观众忍不住笑起来。这个美国总统骑着瘦马垂头而行，旁有中国古词点题：“古道西风瘦马，夕阳西下，断肠人在天涯”。
    和这种“敌人一天天烂下去”的镜头作鲜明对比的是：许多画幅显示出社会主义国家的人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民站在一起，为捍卫世界和平，同帝国主义进行斗争的巨大威力。在巨幅宣传画“全世界被压迫人民团结起来打倒美帝国主义”上，观众看到在地球上各族人民结成排山倒海的强大队伍浩荡走来，美帝国主义强盗抱头鼠窜。“日本人民的风暴”是一幅素描，把东京街头日本人民示威斗争的英勇场面绘得有声有色。此外，像“反帝斗争组画”、“艾森豪威尔！滚回去！开炮！”等作品都显示出中国人民和世界人民反帝国主义侵略的怒潮，正汹涌澎湃，日益高涨。
