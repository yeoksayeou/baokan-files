Xinhua News Agency, London, June 27th - The Political Committee of the British Communist Party today issued a statement on the death of Harry Pollitt, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party.

The statement said: "Harry Pollitt was one of the greatest leaders produced by the British working class."

The statement said: "From the time he began participating in the socialist movement in his hometown of Lancashire in his youth, he dedicated his entire life to the cause of the working class."

The statement pointed out: "Harry Pollitt has always been an incorruptible man, steadfastly loyal to the working class, loyal to the principles of communism, and loyal to the cause of socialism, enduring imprisonment and sacrificing everything for his beliefs."

The statement said: "Fighters all over the world will never forget his struggle against British imperialism's attack on the first socialist country, the Soviet Union.

"From the moment he heard the news of the great October Socialist Revolution in 1917, he understood its great historical significance. His role in the 'Hands Off Russia' movement and in the events leading to the 'Jolly George' strike against the shipment of munitions to be used against the Soviet Union is an immortal part of the history of the British working class."

The statement said: "This spirit of international solidarity also ran through his entire life: in the role he played in the 1927 Hands Off China movement, in his tireless work on behalf of all those victimized by imperialism and reactionaries, and in his great contribution to the cause of colonial liberation."

The statement said: "Hundreds of millions of people oppressed by British imperialism saw in Harry Pollitt another Britain—the true representative of the working class of Britain fighting alongside them against a common enemy.

"It was precisely in the struggle against fascism that Harry Pollitt unreservedly contributed most of his energy and talent. He was the main organizer and inspirer of the British section of the International Brigade, and he played a major role in helping to eliminate the shame brought to Britain by the appeasement and 'non-intervention' policies pursued by the Conservative Party.

"During the Second World War, his self-sacrificing and unwavering efforts inspired workers in the struggle against fascism, for the opening of a second front, and for a just and lasting peace.

"When, after 1945, the Conservative Party and right-wing Labour leaders launched the Cold War against the Soviet Union, Harry Pollitt took the lead in exposing the threat that this policy posed to the true interests of the British people.

"He served as General Secretary of the Communist Party for twenty-seven years, from 1929 to 1956. His accessibility to workers, his concern for people, and his ability to carry out collective work enabled him to provide outstanding leadership in the most difficult and complex situations. In particular, he established the Communist Party as an indispensable part of British political life."

The statement pointed out: "In Britain, the Communist Party's policies are gaining increasing support. The ideas and policies that it first put forward are gaining ground throughout the labor movement. Its membership is growing, and the circulation of the 'Daily Worker' is increasing."

The statement concluded: "The best respect we can show to Harry Pollitt, the best way we can commemorate him, is to advance the struggle to realize the communist ideal (which was his inspiration), to strengthen the party dedicated to realizing these ideals, and to fight for the victory in which he had the greatest and unwavering confidence."

    英共政治委员会发表声明
    推进实现共产主义理想的斗争是纪念哈里·波立特的最好办法
    新华社伦敦27日电　英国共产党政治委员会今天为英国共产党执行委员会主席哈里·波立特的逝世，发表了一项声明。
    声明说：“哈里·波立特是英国工人阶级所产生的最伟大领袖之一。”
    声明说：“他从青年时期在故乡兰开夏开始参加社会主义运动时起，把整个的一生都献给了工人阶级的事业。”
    声明指出：“哈里·波立特一直是不可腐蚀的人，坚如磐石地忠于工人阶级、忠于共产主义原则、忠于社会主义事业，为他的信仰忍受监禁和牺牲一切。”
    声明说：“全世界的战士都永远不会忘记他反对英帝国主义进攻第一个社会主义国家苏联的斗争。
    “从他听到1917年伟大的十月社会主义革命的消息的那一刻起，他就了解到它的重大历史意义。他在‘不准干涉俄国’的运动和导致反对运送军火用来对付苏联的‘乔利·乔治号’罢工的事件中的作用，是英国工人阶级史上不朽的一个部分。”
    声明说：“这种国际团结的精神还贯彻在他整个的一生中：在他在1927年不准干涉中国的运动中所起的作用中，在他代表一切受帝国主义和反动派之害所做的不倦的工作中，和在他对殖民地解放事业的巨大贡献中。”
    声明说：“受英帝国主义压迫的亿万人民在哈里·波立特身上看到了另一个英国——同他们一起对共同敌人作斗争的工人阶级的英国的真正代表。
      “正是在反对法西斯主义的斗争中，哈里·波立特毫不吝啬地贡献了他大部分的精力和才能。他是国际纵队英国部分的主要组织者和鼓舞者，他在帮助消除保守党所执行的姑息和‘不干涉’政策给英国带来的耻辱方面起了重大作用。
    “在第二次世界大战时期，他的自我牺牲的坚持不渝的努力鼓舞了工人们反对法西斯主义、争取开辟第二战线和争取正义及持久和平的斗争。
      “当1945年以后保守党和右翼工党领袖对苏联发动冷战的时候，哈里·波立特率先揭露这种政策对英国人民的真正利益所构成的威胁。
    “他从1929到1956年担任了二十七年的共产党总书记。他对工人的接近，他对人们的关心，他的进行集体工作的能力，使他能够在最困难最复杂的情况下进行最出色的领导。他特别是确立了共产党为英国政治生活中不可缺少的一部分。”
    声明指出：“在英国，共产党的政策正在得到越来越多的支持。它所首先提出的思想和政策正在整个劳工运动中得势。它的党员人数在增长，‘工人日报’的发行数量在增加。”
    声明最后说：“我们能对哈里·波立特表示的最好的敬意、我们能够纪念他的最好的办法，是向前推进争取实现共产主义理想（这是他的鼓舞力量）、争取加强致力实现这些理想的党、争取他有着最大的不渝的信心的胜利的斗争。”
