    Ten Thousand Mu of Orchards Transformed into Grain Fields

    Our Liutianzhuang Commune has ten thousand mu of orchards, where no crops were planted in previous years. This spring, when the commune Party committee organized commune members to discuss how to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, someone suggested: Why not plant crops in the orchards, harvest fruits above and grain below? Everyone said this was a good idea. The commune Party committee attached great importance to this matter. Starting in late May, it organized 1,200 commune members into six specialized teams for digging soil, leveling land, opening ditches, diverting water, transporting water, and sealing ridges. After ten days of intensive work, by June 6th, the entire commune had planted 800,000 ridges of beans and 710,000 clusters of millet in the ten thousand mu of orchards.

    万亩果林变粮川
    我们刘田庄公社有一万亩水果林，往年水果林里是不种庄稼的。今年春天，公社党委在组织社员们讨论怎样实现农业生产更好更全面的跃进的时候，有人提议说：把果树林里种上庄稼，林上收果子，地上收粮食，不是很好吗？大家都说这办法好，公社党委对这件事情很重视，从5月下旬开始，组织了一千二百名社员分成刨土、平地、开沟、下水、运水、封垅等六专业队，经过十天突击，全社到6月6日已在万亩果林里种豆八十万垵，种谷七十一万撮。
