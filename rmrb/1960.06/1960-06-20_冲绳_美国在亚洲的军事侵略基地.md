Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: This reporter reports: Eisenhower's trip to Okinawa is to further plot new war conspiracies.

As U.S. imperialism uses Okinawa Island as its base for creating tension in the Far East and expanding its arms race, American generals are constantly talking about the value of Okinawa, an area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers occupied by the U.S. military for fifteen years, in their eyes. When U.S. Pacific Command Commander Felt spoke of the U.S.'s continued control over Okinawa, he said: Okinawa, now under U.S. administrative rule, is an "important link in the chain" for the U.S. to deal with China in the Pacific region, and if "there is no Okinawa, the entire chain will collapse." U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Kijitz openly admitted that the U.S. regards Okinawa as its military aggression base in the Pacific region. He said: "This island is invaluable as an outpost for the U.S. Marine Corps' Third Division of 15,000 men and land-based aircraft, which can quickly go to any area in the Far East where a small war breaks out."

Okinawa is also the connecting point for the U.S.'s bilateral military treaties with the Philippines, the U.S. with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and the U.S. with Syngman Rhee, and is also within the "scope of application" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Its scope of application includes the territories of China and the Soviet Union.

Not only that, but Okinawa is also the largest U.S. missile base in Asia. The U.S. already has two "Nike-Hercules" missile battalions in Okinawa, and is currently preparing to build eight new "Hawk" missile bases there. Not long ago, the U.S. House of Representatives also passed a plan to establish "Mace" missile bases in Okinawa. Japan's "Mainichi Radio" had long exposed that the U.S. officially decided at the end of last year to turn Okinawa into a medium-range missile base. This radio station said: Okinawa in the Far East "has gradually become the largest base for atomic warfare."

For this reason, the U.S. regards increasing troops to Okinawa as an important means of creating tension in the Far East. Since Eisenhower decided to visit the base network in the Far East, the U.S. military has repeatedly announced an increase in troops to Okinawa to cooperate with Eisenhower's activities to strengthen the "Cold War" in the Far East. In April, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, under Eisenhower's instructions, ordered 2,500 paratroopers to Okinawa. Then, on June 4, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that 1,900 men belonging to the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division would leave Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and go to Okinawa to join the advance team that arrived there a month ago, attempting to intensify military provocations in the Western Pacific. Three days before Eisenhower set off to visit the Far East, the U.S. Army authorities announced that a special combat team composed of 2,000 paratroopers with modern combat equipment would take the transport ship "General Breckinridge" to Okinawa on June 9. It was revealed that this force had received special training and was prepared to conduct "small wars" in the Western Pacific region.

The U.S. does not hide the relationship between increasing troops to Okinawa and forcing the Japanese Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The U.S. Department of Defense also admitted that the U.S. military strengthened its forces on Okinawa Island in June because it estimated that by that time, the parliaments of Japan and the United States had approved the new "Security Treaty." Facts show that Eisenhower's arrival in Okinawa for activities after the U.S. increased troops to Okinawa and Nobusuke Kishi forcibly made the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" "naturally established" in the early hours of the 19th is not a coincidence, but is linked to the U.S.'s conspiracy to intensify the deployment of aggression plans using the Okinawa base.

For more than ten years, 800,000 people in Okinawa, under the leadership of the Okinawa People's Party, have carried out an unyielding anti-U.S. struggle. At the same time, mass movements supporting the Okinawa brothers have also rapidly unfolded on the Japanese mainland. Today, this just struggle against U.S. military bases and against colonialism is still developing. People firmly believe that the U.S. aggressors will one day be driven out of Okinawa by the people of Okinawa and Japan.

### 冲绳——美国在亚洲的军事侵略基地

    冲绳——美国在亚洲的军事侵略基地
    据新华社19日讯　本社记者报道：艾森豪威尔到冲绳去是为了进一步策划新战争的阴谋活动。
    随着美帝国主义利用冲绳岛作为它制造远东紧张局势和扩军备战的基地，美国将军们不断谈论着被美军占领了十五年、面积约二千平方公里的冲绳在他们眼中的价值。美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在谈到美国要继续控制冲绳时说：现在在美国行政统治下的冲绳，是美国在太平洋一带对付中国的“锁链的重要环节”，如果“没有冲绳，整个锁链就会垮台”。美国第七舰队司令基兹特公开承认美国是把冲绳作为它在太平洋地区进行军事侵略的基地的。他说：“这个岛屿作为供美国海军陆战队第三师一万五千人和以陆地为基地的飞机使用的前哨基地来说，是无价之宝，这些飞机可以很快地到远东任何发生小型战争的地区去”。
    冲绳还是美国同菲律宾、美国同蒋介石集团以及美国同李承晚双边军事条约适用范围的联结点，同时也位于新日美“安全条约”的“适用范围”之内。它的适用范围包括中苏两国的领土在内。
    不仅如此，冲绳也是美国在亚洲最大的导弹基地。美国在冲绳已经有两个“奈克—赫尔克里士”导弹营，目前又准备在那里新建八个“隼式”导弹基地。不久前，美国众议院还通过了在冲绳建立“马斯”式导弹基地的计划。日本“每日电台”早就揭露过，美国从去年底就正式决定把冲绳变成中程导弹基地。这家电台说：冲绳在远东“已经逐渐成为原子战争的最大基地了”。
    正因如此，美国把增兵冲绳作为它在远东制造紧张局势的一个重要手段。自从艾森豪威尔决定访问在远东的基地网之后，美国军方一再宣布增兵冲绳，以配合艾森豪威尔来远东加强“冷战”活动。美国参谋长联席会议主席在4月根据艾森豪威尔批示，下令两千五百名伞兵开往冲绳。接着，美国国防部在6月4日宣布，属于美军第八十二空运师的一千九百人将离开北卡罗莱纳州的布拉格堡，前往冲绳同一个月前到那里的先头部队会合，妄图在西太平洋加紧进行军事挑衅。在艾森豪威尔启程访问远东的前三天，美国陆军当局又宣布，由两千名有现代战斗装备的伞兵组成的一个特种战斗队在6月9日乘运输舰“布列金里治——将军”号去冲绳。据透露，这支部队曾经受过专门训练，是准备在西太平洋地区进行“小型战争”的。
    美国方面并不隐讳增兵冲绳和强使日本国会批准新日美“安全条约”日期的关系。美国国防部也承认，美国军方在6月间增强冲绳岛的兵力，是因为估计到那个时候，日美两国国会已经批准新“安全条约”。事实表明，艾森豪威尔在美国增兵冲绳和岸信介强使新日美“安全条约”在19日凌晨“自然成立”之后到达冲绳进行活动，并不是一次偶合，它是同美国企图利用冲绳基地加紧部署侵略计划的阴谋串连在一起的。
    十多年来，八十万冲绳人民在冲绳人民党领导下进行了不屈不挠的反美斗争。同时，支持冲绳兄弟的群众运动也在日本本土迅速展开。今天，这一反对美军基地、反对殖民主义的正义斗争还在不断发展。人们坚信，美国侵略者终有一天要被冲绳和日本人民赶出冲绳去。
