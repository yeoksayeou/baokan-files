Experimentation and Promotion
Song Yaxin, First Secretary of the CPC Danyang County Committee, Jiangsu

Based on learning from the experience of advanced regions, Danyang County successfully manufactured a "Danyang Nong 6031" rice transplanter. In the process of this new thing's growth, we have gained many experiences and inspirations. An important one is that we must give enthusiastic support to new things.

How to support new things? On the one hand, through continuous experimentation, make it gradually move from imperfect to perfect; on the other hand, once the experiment is finalized, vigorously promote it, accumulate more experience in the process of experimentation and promotion, and continuously improve it. Experimentation is the preparation for promotion, and experimentation is for promotion. Experimentation is absolutely necessary. Without sufficient experimentation, it is impossible to obtain successful experience. The emergence of any new thing will not be perfect at the beginning and must go through a process of experimentation to gradually improve. But the so-called experiment does not exclude promotion, let alone passive waiting and stagnation. Of course, the experimental process is not smooth sailing.

Precisely because the growth of new things must go through a difficult and tortuous process, we must take an active and supportive attitude towards it to support its faster growth. In the process of trial production, the "Danyang Nong 6031" rice transplanter also encountered key problems such as inaccurate row spacing control, density control, and seedling hooking and leakage. However, after leading comrades personally participated, went deep into the fields, and conducted on-site consultations with the masses, we finally relied on the masses to overcome this series of difficulties and ensure the quality of the rice transplanter.

Some comrades believe that new tools can only be tested by a few people, not by the majority, for fear that the majority will find problems in the experiment. This idea is essentially a manifestation of a lack of mass perspective. These comrades do not understand the truth that more people mean more discussion, more people mean more enthusiasm, more people mean more power, and more people mean more ideas. If a new tool reform does not go through mass movement, but is done only by a few people, then new things cannot be promoted, and new tools cannot be further improved, and the speed of construction will inevitably be affected. We should believe that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Relying on the masses, we will definitely be able to do things well.

From the perspective of our Danyang situation, there is a lot of land and little labor, and each laborer has to bear the burden of cultivating more than eight mu of land on average. Since the Great Leap Forward, operational procedures have become more demanding, and the season has been brought forward, especially in the seasons of wheat harvesting, rice transplanting, early rice harvesting, and late rice transplanting, which are very tense. It is imperative to vigorously develop rice transplanters. Therefore, we should vigorously promote it once the experiment is finalized. At present, our county has manufactured more than 1,300 rice transplanters, and the whole county's paddy fields have begun to promote the use of rice transplanters. In order to strive for the promotion and use of rice transplanters in a larger area, we are also mass-producing a new type of simple rice transplanter based on the principle of Hunan Liling No. 2, to prepare for large-scale promotion in the future. We are also improving a highly mechanized rice transplanter based on the Jiangxi Yiyang 601 model. All these achievements are preliminary and must be continuously studied and improved to continuously improve and develop. In a word, we must have the spirit of continuous revolution. We must not be discouraged by failure, be humble and learn from others, and learn from everywhere, so that the rice transplanter can be manufactured more perfectly and play a greater role in this year's rice planting. Only in this way is the true attitude of supporting new things. Only in this way can we promote the rapid development of the agricultural technology revolution movement.

    试验和推广
    中共江苏丹阳县委第一书记　宋亚欣
    丹阳县在学习先进地区经验的基础上，制造成功一种“丹农6031号”插秧机。在这个新生事物成长的过程中，我们得到了不少的体会和启发，其中重要一条，就是对待新生事物必须给以热情支持。
    怎样支持新生事物？一方面要通过不断试验，使它从不完善逐步走向完善；另一方面，一经试验定型以后，就要大力推广，在试验推广过程中积累更多的经验，使它不断提高。试验是推广的准备工作，试验就是为了推广。试验是完全必要的，不经过充分的试验，就不可能取得成功的经验，任何新生事物的出现，一开始都不会十全十美的，都要经过试验的过程，才能逐步完善。但所谓试验，并不排斥推广，更不等于消极等待，停步不前。当然试验过程不是一帆风顺的。
    正因为新生事物的成长必须经历艰难曲折的过程，我们就更要对它采取积极支持的态度，扶持它更快的成长。“丹农6031号”插秧机在试制过程中，也曾碰到株距控制不准、密度掌握不住以及勾秧、漏秧等关键问题。但经过领导同志亲自动手，深入田头，与群众一道现场会诊，终于依靠群众战胜了这一系列的困难，保证了插秧机的质量。
    有些同志认为新工具只能由少数人去试验，不能由多数人去试验，怕多数人试验出毛病。这种思想实质上是缺乏群众观念的表现。这些同志不懂得：人多议论多、人多热气高、人多力量大、人多办法多的道理。如果一项新的工具改革，不经过群众运动，只是少数人干，那新生事物就不可能得到发扬光大，新工具就不可能得到进一步的改进，建设的速度就一定要受到影响。我们应该相信群众的智慧是无穷的。依靠群众，就一定能把事情办好。
    从我们丹阳的情况来看，土地多、劳力少，平均每个劳力要负担耕种八亩多土地。大跃进以来，操作规程要求高，季节提早，特别是收麦、栽秧、收早稻、栽晚稻季节十分紧张，大搞插秧机已势在必行。所以，我们应该一经试验定型，就要大力推广。目前我县已经制成插秧机一千三百多部，全县稻田已开始推广使用插秧机。为了争取在更大面积中推广使用插秧机，我们又根据湖南醴陵2号的原理，正在大量制造一种新的简易插秧机，为今后大量推广作好准备。我们还仿照江西弋阳601型，正在改进一种机械化程度较高的插秧机。所有这些成绩，都是初步的，必须要不断研究，不断改进，以求不断提高和发展，一句话，要有不断革命的精神。我们一定要做到失败不灰心，不泄气，虚心求教，到处取经，把插秧机制造得更加完善，在今年水稻栽插中发挥更大作用。只有这样，才是真正的支持新生事物的态度。也才能促进农业技术革命运动的迅速发展。
