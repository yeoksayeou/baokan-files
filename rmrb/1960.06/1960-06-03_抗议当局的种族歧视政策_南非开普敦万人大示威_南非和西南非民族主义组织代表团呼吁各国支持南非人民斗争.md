Xinhua News Agency, June 1st dispatch from Cape Town: Approximately 10,000 people of all races in South Africa held a demonstration in Cape Town on May 31st to protest the racial discrimination policies pursued by the South African Federal authorities.

May 31st marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of the South African Federation. The South African government had wanted people to celebrate this "anniversary" of the establishment of dark rule in South Africa by a minority of white colonialists, but this was resisted by Africans and other South African democrats.

According to reports, the marching crowd held a swearing-in ceremony at the Drill Hall in Cape Town. They swore to make the "nation eradicate the disaster of poverty and achieve the foundation of a government established with everyone's consent." Then, the marching crowd turned to the large square opposite the City Hall for a rally. Thousands of people gathered along the streets through which the marching crowd passed, and many people joined the ranks of the march.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo dispatch: A delegation composed of representatives from South African and Southwest African nationalist organizations held a press conference in Cairo on May 24th, calling on all independent African countries and freedom-loving countries to immediately take unified action to oppose the current Verwoerd government in South Africa and support the struggle of the people there.

The delegation, composed of Oliver Tambo, Deputy President of the African National Congress of South Africa, Nana Mahomo, Secretary-General of the Pan-Africanist Congress, Yusuf Dadoo, Vice President of the South African Indian Congress, and Kozonguizi, Secretary-General of the South West Africa National Union, stated that we are determined to get rid of foreign shackles and will never give up the work of uniting all Africans. The delegation said that despite the South African government's police searches and various barbaric atrocities, the people there are still fighting for the cause of freedom.

The delegation said that the massacre of unarmed women and children by the South African authorities has become commonplace there, and more than 20,000 people are still being held in prisons. The delegation emphasized that the massacre cannot intimidate the South African people.

The delegation pointed out that in our struggle for freedom, we are encouraged and confident by the victories achieved by our African brotherly countries.

    新华社1日讯　开普敦消息：南非各种族约一万人5月31日在开普敦举行示威游行，抗议南非联邦当局所奉行的种族歧视政策。
    5月31日是南非联邦成立五十周年的日子，南非政府曾要人们庆祝这个由少数白种殖民者在南非建立黑暗统治的“纪念日”，但是遭到非洲人和其他南非民主人士的抵制。
    据报道，游行队伍在开普敦的演武厅举行了宣誓仪式。他们宣誓将使“国家根除贫穷的灾难，并达成一个经过大家同意而成立的政府的基础”。接着，游行队伍转向市府大厅对面的大广场上举行集会。在游行队伍通过的大街两旁聚集着数千人，有许多人参加了游行的行列。
    据新华社开罗电　由南非和西南非洲的民族主义组织代表组成的一个代表团5月24日在开罗举行的记者招待会上，呼吁所有非洲独立国家和爱好自由的国家立即采取统一行动来反对南非目前的维沃尔德政府和支持那里人民的斗争。
    这个由南非非洲人国民大会副主席奥利弗·坦博、泛非主义者大会总书记纳纳·莫霍莫、南非印度人大会副主席优素福·达杜和西南非洲民族联盟总书记科章吉济组成的代表团表示，我们决心摆脱外国的枷锁，并且决不放弃团结全体非洲人的工作。代表团说，尽管南非政府进行警察搜捕和采取种种野蛮的暴行，但是，那里的人民仍在为自由事业而斗争。
    代表团说，南非当局屠杀手无寸铁的妇女和儿童在那里已经成为司空见惯的事，现在仍有二万多人被关在监狱中。代表团强调指出，大屠杀不能吓倒南非人民。
    代表团指出，在我们争取自由的斗争中，我们从非洲兄弟国家所取得的胜利中得到鼓舞和信心。
