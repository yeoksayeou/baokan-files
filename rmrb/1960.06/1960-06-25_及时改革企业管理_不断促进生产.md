    Promptly Reform Enterprise Management and Continuously Promote Production
    Shi Yuyong, Director of Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory

    Continuously improving enterprise management and promoting the sustained leap forward in production are among the basic tasks of socialist enterprise leaders.
    Since the second half of 1959, with the great development of production, the factory's enterprise management and production development have become increasingly incompatible. To change this situation, we have carried out several reforms successively. Facts have proven that the continuous revolution in enterprise management not only promotes the sustained leap forward in production but also greatly changes the mental outlook of employees.
    Enterprise Management Must
      Continuously Revolutionize
    In 1958, based on the rectification movement, our factory vigorously improved enterprise management, further established the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee; established the employee representative congress and the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations"; and reformed some rules and regulations. This played a significant role in promoting the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958. However, because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the nature of improving enterprise management at that time and did not deeply appreciate it, the backward state of enterprise management was not thoroughly improved in the context of the sustained leap forward in production in 1959. As a result, production in May and June of that year once declined. To learn from this lesson, in the third quarter of last year, we launched a mass movement to comprehensively strengthen enterprise management, mobilizing all employees to voice their opinions on the problems existing in enterprise management. In ten days, employees put forward 5,025 opinions and suggestions on the existing problems in technical management, planning management, and business management, and posted 1,024 big-character posters. Based on these opinions, we conducted repeated and meticulous research using the "three combination" method, and proposed comprehensive reform plans in several aspects, such as technical management and planning management; at the same time, we continued to eliminate some old rules and regulations that were incompatible with the production situation, and established and improved more than 100 new rules and regulations, greatly improving the level of management, thereby ensuring that the production level in the third quarter increased by about 21% compared to May and June. The continuous revolution in enterprise management has become an important aspect of the continuous leap forward in production.
      Everything for the Development of Production
    Constantly reforming enterprise management is the objective requirement of production development. We have deeply realized from the enterprise management reform work in the past year that reforming enterprise management must firmly establish the production viewpoint, political viewpoint, and mass viewpoint. The purpose of reforming enterprise management is to promote the development of production. Therefore, it is wrong to talk about the reform of enterprise management in isolation from production. In the past, some people in our factory did not establish this viewpoint of continuous leap forward, so when weak links appeared in production, they did not start with management to make active improvements, but only saw things and not people; when formulating plans, they only considered or excessively emphasized objective difficulties such as materials and equipment, and carried out passive balancing. As a result, the planning management work could not fully reflect the subjective initiative of people and limited the enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, although enterprise management work was improved in form, the idea of passive balancing still restricted the development of production. Since strengthening management work, we have criticized this idea, and through vigorously launching mass movements and implementing political command, the ideological understanding of management personnel has been continuously improved. On this basis, we also reformed the organization and leadership of planning work, implemented long-term planning with short-term arrangements, and the method of focusing on short-term lines to support long-term lines, and grasping daily plans to ensure ten-day plans, and grasping ten-day plans to ensure monthly plans. This effectively guaranteed the completion of the plan. In order to make management personnel establish the production viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and political viewpoint, in the fourth quarter of last year, we carried out an ideological education movement for serving production, serving the masses, and serving the central work of the Party among all cadres in the factory. Through great airing of views, great contention, great debates, and great inspections, ideological understanding was improved, and staff members of the departments expressed their determination and formulated service plans. The technology department also deepened into the workshops and connected with the workers by ordering service projects, helping the workers to realize technical transformation projects or helping the workshops solve production technology problems. Service stations were established in some key working sections, and staff members of the departments moved to the working sections to work. These practices were deeply welcomed by the employees. After this department launched the movement to serve production, it realized 20 service projects in three days. Financial personnel went deep into the groups to help workers carry out economic accounting. The administrative welfare department delivered meals to the workshops, and the canteen opened day and night continuously, which greatly facilitated the employees. Through vigorously launching the service movement, the ideological awareness of the staff members of the departments was greatly improved, and the work style was changed, laying an ideological foundation for the continuous reform of enterprise management.
  Close Combination of Professional Management and Worker Management
    In enterprise management, the management of professional personnel must be closely combined with the management of the worker masses. In fact, because workers are direct participants in production and are most familiar with the various problems in the production process, it is very necessary to absorb worker masses to participate in management and give full play to their enthusiasm. If professional management personnel in enterprise management are not combined with worker managers, management work will not be done well. While emphasizing workers' participation in enterprise management, we also criticized the "burden-shedding" idea and practice of professional personnel handing over all daily trivial matters to worker managers. Because this practice will affect the production efficiency of workers. In order to correctly combine professional management personnel and worker managers, we linked the business management personnel of departments and workshops with the worker managers of groups through the methods of "three combinations" and hooked-up competitions, and combined them up and down according to the business system, thereby greatly improving the level of management. At present, worker managers, who account for more than half of the total number of workers in the factory, have become an important force in enterprise management. After the worker managers actively played their role under the guidance of professional personnel, many problems in enterprise management that had not been solved in the past were solved. Reforming Enterprise Management Requires Vigorously Launching Mass Movements
    The revolution in enterprise management is essentially a major adjustment of production relations within the enterprise. It must not only change the rules and regulations and organizational structure that are not suitable for the development of productive forces, but also change people's thinking style and working methods. Therefore, our factory has always strengthened the leadership of the Party, adhered to political command, and constantly eliminated various ideological obstacles in the reform of enterprise management. In each reform of enterprise management in our factory, we encountered this or that conservative thought. Some people believe that enterprise management is different from production technology and cannot be revolutionized. Even if it can be revolutionized, it cannot be continuously revolutionized. They say, "Enterprise management has been reformed many times, and there is nothing to change now"; "If you want to change, you can only rely on professional personnel to change it, and you cannot vigorously launch mass movements," and so on. If all these ideas are not resolved in time, they will hinder the reform of enterprise management.
    In order to overcome these ideological obstacles, the factory Party committee often strengthened ideological education for cadres, and carried out airing of views, contention and debates against the exposed wrong ideas, and carried out criticism in a timely manner by presenting facts and reasoning. Facts tell us that the reform of enterprise management, like technological innovation, is endless. As long as production continues to develop, enterprise management must be continuously reformed, otherwise it will become a stumbling block to the development of production. This reform can only be carried out in a timely and thorough manner by vigorously launching mass movements. In vigorously launching mass movements, conscientiously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is an important aspect of promoting enterprise reform. In the third quarter of last year, in order to summarize the experience of improving enterprise management since the Great Leap Forward, we used two months to organize cadres and workers throughout the factory to carry out mass airing of views, great contention, and great summary. A total of more than 8,000 suggestions were put forward this time, and then the leaders of each department, office, workshop, and group formulated plans for further reforming enterprise management according to the opinions of the masses, so that enterprise management entered a new stage.

    及时改革企业管理  不断促进生产
    沈阳机车车辆工厂厂长　石玉永
    不断地改进企业管理，促进生产持续跃进，这是社会主义企业领导人员的基本任务之一。
    1959年下半年以来，随着生产的大发展，我厂企业管理和生产发展日益不相适应。为了改变这种状况，我们曾先后进行了几次改革。事实证明，企业管理的不断革命，不仅促进了生产的持续跃进，而且也大大改变了职工的精神面貌。
    企业管理必须
      不断革命
    1958年，我厂在整风运动的基础上，曾大力改进了企业管理，进一步确立了党委领导下的厂长负责制；建立了职工代表大会和“两参一改三结合”的制度；同时改革了一些规章制度。这对于促进1958年生产大跃进起了重大作用。但是，由于我们当时对改进企业管理的性质认识不足，体会不深，因此，在1959年生产持续跃进的情况下，企业管理的落后状况并没有得到彻底改善。结果当年5、6月份的生产曾一度下降。为了接受这一教训，我们在去年第三季度内，展开了一个全面加强企业管理的群众性运动，发动全厂职工针对企业管理上存在的问题，开展了大鸣大放。广大职工在十天里，就对技术管理、计划管理、经营管理中存在的问题，提出五千零二十五条意见和建议，贴出大字报一千零二十四张。我们根据这些意见，用三结合的办法，进行了反复细致的研究，从技术管理、计划管理等几个方面，提出了全面的改革方案；同时继续破除了一些与生产形势不相适应的旧规章制度，建立和健全了一百多种新的规章制度，大大提高了管理水平，从而保证了第三季度生产水平比5、6两月提高了21％左右。企业管理的不断革命，就成为生产不断跃进的重要方面了。
      一切为了发展生产
    不断改革企业管理，是生产发展的客观要求。我们从最近一年来的企业管理改革工作中深深体会到，改革企业管理，必须坚定地树立生产观点、政治观点、群众观点。改革企业管理的目的，是为了促进生产的发展。因此，离开生产孤立地去谈企业管理的改革，这是不对的。过去，我厂有些人没有树立这种持续跃进的观点，因而当生产出现薄弱环节时，不是从管理工作着手进行积极的改进，而是见物不见人；在制订计划时，只考虑到或过多的强调材料、设备等客观困难，进行消极的平衡。结果使计划管理工作，不能充分反映人的主观能动性，限制了群众积极性的发挥。这样，企业管理工作尽管在形式上有了改进，但消极平衡的思想，仍然是限制了生产的发展。自从加强管理工作以来，我们便对这种思想进行了批判，并且通过大搞群众运动和实行政治挂帅，使管理人员的思想认识得到了不断的提高。在这个基础上，我们又改革了计划工作的组织领导，实行了长计划短安排，抓短线配长线的方法，以狠抓日计划来保旬计划，狠抓旬计划来保月计划。这样就有效地保证了计划的完成。为了使管理人员树立生产观点、群众观点和政治观点，去年第四季度，我们在全厂干部中开展一个为生产服务，为群众服务，为党的中心工作服务的思想教育运动。通过大鸣、大放、大辩论，大检查，提高了思想认识，科室人员纷纷表示决心，并制订了服务计划。工艺科还通过订服务项目的办法，深入车间和工人挂钩，帮助工人实现技术改造项目或帮助车间解决生产技术问题。在一些重点工段，建立服务站，科室人员搬到工段去办公。这些做法，深受职工的欢迎。这个科开展为生产服务运动以后，三天时间就实现了二十个服务项目。财务人员纷纷深入小组，帮助工人搞经济核算。行政福利部门送饭到车间，食堂昼夜连续开饭，大大方便了职工群众。通过大搞服务运动，是大大地提高了科室人员的思想觉悟，改变了工作作风，为不断改革企业管理打下了思想基础。
  专业管理工人管理紧密结合
    在企业管理工作中，必须使专业人员的管理和工人群众的管理密切结合起来。事实上，由于工人是生产的直接参加者，对生产过程中的各种问题最熟悉，因而吸收工人群众参加管理，并充分发挥他们的积极性是十分必要的。如果在企业管理上专业管理人员不同工人管理员结合起来，就不会作好管理工作。我们在强调工人参与企业管理工作的同时，也批判了专业人员把日常繁琐的事务统统交给工人管理员的“卸包袱”思想和做法。因为这种做法，会影响工人的生产效率。为了正确地使专业管理人员和工人管理员结合起来，我们通过三结合、挂钩竞赛的办法，把科室、车间的业务管理人员和小组的工人管理员串在一起，按业务系统上下结合起来，从而大大提高了管理水平。目前，在全厂占工人总数一半以上的工人管理员已经成为企业管理中的重要力量。工人管理员在专业人员指导下，积极发挥作用以后，企业管理中很多过去没有解决的问题解决了。改革企业管理要大搞群众运动
    企业管理的革命实质上是企业内部生产关系的大调整，它不仅要改变不适合生产力发展的规章制度和组织机构，而且也要改变人们的思想作风和工作方法。因此，我厂在进行企业管理的改革中，始终加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，不断扫除各种思想障碍。我厂在每次改革企业管理中，都遇到这种或那种保守思想。有些人认为：企业管理不同于生产技术，不能进行革命。即使能革命，也不能不断革命。说什么：“企业管理已经过多次改革，现在没什么可改的了”；“要改，也只能靠专业人员来改，不能大搞群众运动”等等。所有这些思想如不能及时解决，都会阻碍企业管理的改革。
    为了克服这些思想障碍，工厂党委经常加强了对干部的思想教育，针对暴露出的错误思想，进行鸣放辩论，通过摆事实，讲道理，及时地进行了批判。事实告诉我们，企业管理的改革也同技术革新一样，是无止境的，只要生产不断发展，企业管理就必须不断改革，否则就会成为生产发展的绊脚石。这种改革，只有大搞群众运动，才能改得及时，改得彻底。在大搞群众运动中，认真地总结，推广先进经验，又是推动企业改革的重要方面。去年第三季度，我们为了把大跃进以来改进企业管理的经验进行总结，曾利用二个月时间，组织全厂干部和工人开展了群众性的大鸣、大放、大总结。这次共提出建议八千多条，然后各科、室、车间、小组领导都根据群众的意见，订出了进一步改革企业管理的方案，从而使企业管理进入了一个新的阶段。
