Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd dispatch: To bolster the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique, which is under furious condemnation, the United States is preparing to quickly pass the U.S.-Japan military treaty in Congress before Eisenhower departs for his "visit" to Japan.
    U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright announced yesterday that the committee will meet on the 7th to discuss the U.S.-Japan military treaty. He stated that after the treaty is "discussed" in the Foreign Relations Committee, it will be quickly submitted to the Senate for approval. According to the U.S. Constitution, the Senate has the power to ratify international treaties.
    Fulbright had previously announced that his committee's discussion and passage of the U.S.-Japan military treaty would take place after the Japanese Senate completed its ratification of the treaty. However, as the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty has grown stronger, the United States has become increasingly concerned about the treaty and the fate of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Therefore, it has decided to advance the rapid ratification of the U.S.-Japan military treaty in order to support Kishi Nobusuke and strengthen the ruling position of the traitorous clique. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington admitted: "It is believed here that the U.S. Senate's action to approve the security treaty will strengthen Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's position in the current crisis."

    为危机重重的岸信介集团撑腰
    美国企图匆匆批准美日军事条约
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：为了给受到愤怒谴责的岸信介卖国集团撑腰，美国正准备赶在艾森豪威尔动身去“访问”日本之前，在国会迅速通过美日军事条约。
    美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特昨天宣布，这个委员会将在7日开会讨论美日军事条约。他表示，这个条约在外交委员会进行“讨论”以后，将迅速送交参议院批准。按照美国宪法，参议院具有批准国际条约的权力。
    富布赖特早些时候曾经宣布，他的委员会讨论和通过美日军事条约的日期将在日本参议院完成对这个条约批准手续之后；但是，随着日本人民反对日美军事条约的斗争声势越来越浩大，美国对这个条约和岸信介政府的命运也越来越不放心，因此决定提前迅速批准美日军事条约，以便为岸信介撑腰，加强卖国集团的统治地位。美联社从华盛顿发出的一条消息承认：“这里认为，美国参议院采取批准安全条约的行动，将加强岸信介首相在当前危机中的地位。”
