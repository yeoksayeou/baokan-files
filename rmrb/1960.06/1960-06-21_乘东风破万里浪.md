Riding the East Wind, Breaking Ten Thousand Li of Waves
Xiao San

There are approximately six million residents in Beijing. Today, about four or five thousand people are attending this meeting. What proportion of the total population of Beijing does that represent? My arithmetic isn't very good; please calculate it for me. But I dare say that at least 650 million people support us! I also dare say that out of the world's 2.7 billion people, at least 2.43 billion support us! Several thousand of us are gathered here, in this huge and beautiful music hall in Zhongshan Park, to hold a poetry recitation and concert in support of the heroic struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, seeking national independence, freedom, democracy, and liberation. That is, to sing for our era, for our world! Comrades! Friends! Today, we live in the greatest era. Look, everywhere there are people's raging waves and angry seas. The blood of the oppressed people all over the world is boiling. They can no longer tolerate the bullying of foreign invaders. From the Black Sea and the Red Sea, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, everywhere is the angry volcano of the people. The roar of "Down with American imperialism" shakes heaven, earth, and humanity. Your lifespan is not long, very short! That number one enemy of mankind, the number one leader, a blatant and utter warmonger, the master of a few traitorous lackeys, has said all kinds of nonsense and done all kinds of bad things. Now he has run to the Far East to create big trouble. He is here to inspect his Far East front, to intensify the tense situation in the world. Military deployment in Japan is naturally a key point. How much he wanted to show his face there, but like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts "Kill it!" It scares him so much that he is always on edge and terrified. The vanguard arrived in Japan and was immediately surrounded by the people. If it hadn't been for a helicopter rescue, it would have been impossible to escape. He himself, with a thick face and a stiff head, finally had to retreat in the face of anger. The head of a dignified country, embarrassing himself so much, woe is him, alas, how stinky, how stinky! Well done, the heroic Japanese people resolutely resist. The anti-American, anti-Kishi movement is truly higher than the last. They continue to move forward, treading on the blood of the martyrs—we will never agree to turn the Japanese people into slaves of the United States! He naturally remembers that when he first arrived in the Philippines, he was hit by a stone of popular anger. The stone hit the face of his military assistant. Fortunately, this scapegoat had taken out life insurance long ago... Now he has scurried into our sacred territory, Taiwan. Which patriotic Chinese isn't filled with anger? Before the plague god even arrives, the people there have already suffered: how many families have been broken up, how many houses have been destroyed! Our great Chinese people have always despised and scorned paper tigers. The Fujian front fired cannons to bombard the plague god, and anti-American armed demonstrations were held—as an expression of "welcome and farewell." The sound of the guns of the great motherland resounded across the Pacific Ocean, flying to Taipei, Keelung, and to the head of the plague god. Plague god, oh plague god, you have nowhere to hide on the whole earth! Robber, oh robber, the flames of anger are burning all over the world, see where you run with your tail between your legs! True, you have all learned to enter and exit through the back door, but the people will grab your fox tail, and tighten the noose around your neck. You can only slip away and run back home! Now you have to go "visit" South Korea ahead of schedule, and can only hide behind bulletproof glass. Look, the workers, peasants, students, and professors there, drove out Heo Jeong, just like they drove out Syngman Rhee. Look, who isn't shaking their fist at you? Who isn't glaring at you? You are pointed at by millions of hands, can you avoid dying of fright?! Our gathering today is to support the just and patriotic struggles of the people of all countries, to express our greatest and most heartfelt respect to them, to express our infinite hatred for American imperialism, and to support the written statement of the Fujian Front Command. Let our poems emit the sound of the vast people! Let our poems be transformed into a huge material force! Let our poems become a battle horn! Let our poems strike the enemy's chest! Let us ride the East Wind and break ten thousand li of waves! Let us sing loudly in chorus with our brothers and sisters in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

[Editor's Note] On the evening of the 18th of this month, poets, musicians, and more than 3,000 people in the capital held an anti-imperialist poetry recitation and concert in the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to support the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is the opening speech by poet Xiao San.

    乘东风破万里浪
    萧三北京的居民大约有六百万，今天到这个会的有个四五千，究竟占全北京人口多少比例？我的算术很不好，请大家算一算。但是我敢说，赞成我们的人，至少有六万万五千万！我还敢说，全世界二十七亿人，赞成我们的至少有二十四亿三千万！我们几千人在这里相处一堂，在中山公园这个巨大漂亮的音乐堂，举行诗歌朗诵和演唱，为的是支持亚、非、拉丁美洲的人民，反对帝国主义、殖民主义的英勇斗争，谋求民族独立、自由、民主和解放。也就是为我们的时代、我们的世界而歌唱！同志们！朋友们！今天我们处在一个最伟大的时代，你看，到处是人民的狂涛和怒海，全世界被压迫人民的热血已经沸腾，他们对外国强盗的欺侮再也不能容忍。从黑海、红海，从大西洋到太平洋两岸，到处是人民愤怒的火山。打倒美国帝国主义的吼声，震动了天上、地下、人间，你的寿命已经不长了，很短！那个人类头号敌人的头号头子，明目张胆的十足的战争贩子，几个卖国奴才的强盗主子，他说尽了鬼话，做尽了坏事，现在却跑到远东来搞大乱子。他这是来视察他的远东前线，要在这里加剧世界紧张局面，军事部署日本自然是个重点，他多么想，在那里露一露脸，可是“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，直吓得他处处提心吊胆，魂飞魄散。先行官一到日本就被人民包围，不是直升飞机救驾，真是插翅难飞，他自己厚着个脸皮，硬着个头皮，终于不得不在怒火面前知难而退。堂堂一国元首，而竟如此丢丑，忧·哀死·哀，唉，真臭呵，真臭！好样的，英勇的日本人民坚决反抗，反美、反岸运动真是一浪高过一浪。他们踏着牺牲者的血迹继续前进，把日本人民变为美国的奴隶——决不答
  应！他自然记得，自己刚到菲律宾的时候，就挨了一下人民愤怒的石头，石头打中他的军事助手的脸，好在这替死鬼早就作了人寿保险……现在他窜到了我国神圣的领土，台湾爱国的中国人谁不满腔愤怒，瘟神未到，那里的人民就遭了殃：拆散了多少人家，毁坏了多少房屋！我们伟大的中国人民，对纸老虎一贯蔑视，鄙视。福建前线开炮轰打瘟神，反美武装示威——作为“欢迎欢送”的表
    示。伟大祖国的炮声一响，飞到太平洋上，飞到台北、基隆，飞到瘟神的头上。瘟神呀，瘟神，全地面上你已无处藏身！强盗呀，强盗，全地面上愤怒的火焰在燃烧，看你夹着尾巴往哪儿跑！不错，你们都学会了从后门出进，可是人民要抓住你的狐狸尾巴，要把绞索在你的脖子上勒得紧紧，你只有灰溜溜地逃回老家！现在你只得提早去“访问”南朝鲜，也只能躲在避弹玻璃的后面，看，那里的工人、农民、学生、教授，赶走许政，也像赶走过李承晚。你看，谁不对你挥动着拳头？谁不对你怒目切齿？你是千千万万只手所指，你能不无病而死？！我们今天这个集会，就是支持各国人民的正义爱国斗争，就是向他们表示最大的衷心的尊敬，就是表示对美帝国主义无比的憎恨，就是支持福建前线司令部的书面声明。让我们的诗歌发出广大的人民的音响！让我们的诗歌化为巨大的物质的力量！让我们的诗歌成为战斗的号角！让我们的诗歌打中敌人的胸膛！让我们乘东风破万里浪！让我们和亚、非、拉丁美洲的兄弟姊妹高
  声合唱！
      〔编者附注〕本月18日晚，首都的诗人、音乐家和三千多群众在中山公园音乐堂举行了支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民民族民主运动的反帝诗歌朗诵演唱会。这是诗人萧三的开幕词。
