Xinhua News Agency, Hargeisa, June 27th: Former British Somaliland, located in East Africa, officially declared its independence on the 26th.

On the morning of the 26th, an independence declaration ceremony was held in Hargeisa, the capital of the new nation. Somaliland Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal took the oath of independence and raised the flag. From midnight on the 25th, groups of Somaliland residents sang and danced in the streets, celebrating their victory in the long struggle against colonial rule.

After Italian-administered Somaliland declares its independence on July 1, the two countries will merge. Somaliland, which declared its independence on the 26th, Italian-administered Somaliland, and French Somaliland were originally a unified country, later occupied and divided by the three imperialist powers of Britain, France, and Italy. Since British imperialism began invading this part of Somaliland in 1884, the people there have been fighting against British colonial rule and for national independence and unification. Under the resolute struggle of the Somaliland people, the British authorities were forced in May of this year to agree to the independence of this part of Somaliland occupied by it on June 26. However, the British government also announced that for six months after Somaliland's independence, a British "aid" delegation would continue to stay there to "work" for Somaliland, and British-appointed military personnel would continue to hold key positions in the Somaliland local security forces for at least six months.

    索马里兰宣告独立
    新华社27日讯　哈尔格萨消息：位于东非的前英属索马里兰26日正式宣布独立。
    26日清早，在这个新国家首都哈尔格萨举行了宣布独立的仪式。索马里兰总理穆罕默德·哈吉·易卜拉欣·埃加勒进行了独立宣誓并升旗。从25日午夜起，成群的索马里兰居民就在街道上载歌载舞，庆祝他们长时期进行反对殖民统治斗争的胜利。
    在意大利托管的索马里兰在7月1日宣布独立后，两个国家将要合并。26日宣布独立的索马里兰同意大利托管的索马里兰和法属索马里兰原是统一的国家，后来被英、法、意三个帝国主义所占领和分割。自从英帝国主义于1884年开始侵入索马里兰这一部分以后，那里的人民一直为反对英国殖民统治和争取民族独立和统一而斗争。在索马里兰人民坚决斗争下，英国当局在今年5月被迫同意被它占领的这部分索马里兰在6月26日独立。但是英国政府同时宣布，索马里兰在独立后6个月内，一个英国的“援助”代表团将继续留在那里为索马里兰“工作”，英国指定的军事人员至少要在索马里兰地方保安队中继续担任要职六个月。
