Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 29th - Communist Party members of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are active on the front line of production, becoming the backbone force in uniting the broad masses to strive for sustained leaps forward in production. Among the more than 16,000 new Party members admitted in the first half of this year alone, over 70% have been评为 rated as Red Banner Holders, Labor Models, Advanced Workers, or Youth Shock Troops.

At present, the total number of Communist Party members in the region has increased by 1.6 times compared to 1956. Among them, there are Party members from thirteen nationalities, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Tajik. The Uyghur nationality, with the largest population, has over 60,000 outstanding members participating in the Communist Party. The Tajik nationality, with a population of only over 8,000, has also established twenty-seven Party branches in the mountainous areas separated by snow mountains. Over one hundred and eighty Tajik Party members, in order to implement the Party's policies, traverse mountains and ridges year-round, regardless of cold and heat, to lead the masses in remote mountainous areas to vigorously engage in production. On the Altai Mountain grasslands, where the Kazakh people live, nearly two hundred Party branches have been established, and over nine thousand Kazakh Communist Party members have become the backbone force in uniting local herdsmen to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production and change the backward outlook of the mountainous areas.

Eighty percent of the Communist Party members of all nationalities distributed in agricultural and pastoral areas have been elected by the masses as commune directors, management district directors, or production team leaders and other leading cadres. They share weal and woe with the masses and work selflessly to achieve sustained leaps forward in production. In Hotan Prefecture, surrounded by the Taklamakan Desert and the Kunlun Mountains, over fifteen thousand Party members of all nationalities have gone to the wilderness to lead the masses in reclaiming wasteland and building water conservancy projects this year to secure more grain. After half a year of effort, they have transformed over 800,000 mu of sandy wasteland into fertile fields. Yusu Ying’aishan, the production team leader of the Xinsheng Production Team of the Wuqia Commune in Yingjisha County, who is known as a "Good Son of the Uyghur People," has consistently insisted on eating, living, and working with the masses for the past eight years, never leaving his manure basket or sickle behind. Last year, under his leadership, the Xinsheng Production Team changed from a formerly poor team to a wealthy one, and he himself worked over two hundred workdays. Zi Nula, the director of the Dongfeng Commune in Tuoli County and a Communist Party member, organized over two hundred commune members in March this year to rescue livestock trapped by heavy snow. He personally drove a sleigh, braving strong winds and snow to cross several mountain ridges and transport fodder to the disaster area. At that time, some of the sheep were still blocked by heavy snow on the mountains, desperately needing rescue due to the exhaustion of grass and feed. However, the snow was heavy and the slopes were steep, making it impossible for vehicles and horses to pass. Zi Nula led more than ten cadres, treading through the heavy snow to carry grass up the mountains, carrying five hundred bundles in one night. After five days and nights of hard work, all 25,000 livestock were finally rescued without a single death. Jiang Zhaozhi, an agricultural technology innovation pacesetter and a Communist Party member in the autonomous region, is a member of the Hongqi Commune in Hutubi County. Because of his diligent study, he has created and modified 25 kinds of agricultural machines using indigenous methods in recent years, including deep plows, seeders, seedling transplanters, and combined cultivators for inter-row cultivation and topdressing, which has promoted agricultural technology innovation in the autonomous region.

    与广大社员同甘共苦　为生产跃进忘我工作
    新疆各族党员活跃在农业生产第一线
    新华社乌鲁木齐29日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各民族的共产党员，活跃在生产第一线，成为团结广大群众争取生产持续跃进的骨干力量。仅在今年上半年接收的一万六千多名新党员中，就有70％以上被评为红旗手、劳动模范、先进工作者或青年突击手。
    目前，全区共产党员人数已比1956年增加了一点六倍，其中维吾尔、哈萨克、汉、回、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等十三个民族都有了党员。人口最多的维吾尔族，有六万多名优秀分子参加了共产党。只有八千多人口的塔吉克族，也在雪山隔阻的山区建立起二十七个党的支部，一百八十多名塔吉克族党员为了贯彻执行党的政策，终年不避寒暑，翻山越岭到边远山区领导群众大搞生产。在哈萨克族聚居的阿尔泰山草原上，建立了近二百个党的支部，九千多名哈萨克族共产党员成为团结当地牧民发展农牧业生产、改变山区落后面貌的骨干力量。
    分布在农牧区的各民族共产党员，80％被群众选为公社主任、管理区主任或生产队长等领导干部，他们同群众同甘共苦，为实现生产持续跃进而忘我地工作。被塔克拉马干大沙漠和昆仑山所包围的和田专区一万五千多名各民族党员，为了向荒地要粮，今年纷纷到荒野带领群众开荒和兴修水利，经过半年努力，已把八十多万亩沙荒变成良田。被誉为“维吾尔族好儿子”的英吉沙县乌恰公社新生生产队队长玉素英艾山，八年来始终坚持和群众同吃同住同劳动，粪筐、镰刀不离身。去年他领导新生生产队由过去有名的穷队变成了富队，自己还劳动了二百多个劳动日。托里县东风公社主任、共产党员孜努拉，在今年3月间为了抢救被大雪围困的牲畜，组织了二百多名社员，并且亲自赶着爬犁，冒着大风雪翻过几道山岭，把草料赶运到灾区。当时有一部分羊群仍被大雪阻在山上，草尽料绝急待救援，但雪大坡陡，车马不能通行，孜努拉就带领十多名干部踏着大雪往山上背草，一夜背了五百捆。经过五昼夜苦战，终于使二万五千头牲畜全部脱险，无一死亡。自治区农业技术革新标兵、共产党员蒋兆枝，是呼图壁县红旗公社的社员，由于他刻苦钻研，几年来用土办法创造和改装了深耕犁、播种机、移苗器和中耕追肥联合机等二十五种农业机器，对开展自治区农业技术革新起了推动作用。
