Is imperialism more powerful? Or are the people more powerful? People can draw a clear answer from the Far East trip of Eisenhower, the number one imperialist – the head of U.S. imperialism.

Eisenhower's Far East trip has ended in a shameful failure. The past week has been a sensational week for the world. Even Western newspapers believe that Eisenhower's Far East trip was "the most serious blow (to the United States) since World War II," and it marks "the failure of the U.S. Far East foreign policy." Indeed, what other conclusion can be drawn? Today's Far East is no longer a paradise for American bandits. The people of the Far East, deeply oppressed by U.S. imperialism, can no longer endure it.

The American ruling clique knew before Eisenhower set off that his trip was full of "risks." In the waves of opposition to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, Syngman Rhee and Menderes fell one after another, and the Kishi Nobusuke government was also in a precarious situation. The U.S. aggression front in the Far East was facing the danger of total collapse. Eisenhower knew things were bad, but he still had to bite the bullet and come, trying to stabilize his aggressive position in the Far East. The always arrogant and self-righteous U.S. imperialism originally thought that Eisenhower's personal appearance, coupled with the show of force by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, could turn the tide. However, U.S. imperialism, like other imperialists and all reactionaries, can never make a correct assessment of the objective situation. It always overestimates its own strength and underestimates the strength of the people. In this way, Eisenhower brought trouble upon himself.

Eisenhower originally placed his main bet for this Far East trip on his visit to Japan. This is because U.S. imperialism has always regarded Japanese militarism as a reliable accomplice for its aggression in the Far East, and the recent heroic struggle of the Japanese people has threatened its entire plan for aggressive war in Asia. The Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government, regardless of the opposition of the Japanese people, insisted on Eisenhower's visit to Japan until the last moment, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of resistance of the Japanese people, exert influence to support the tottering Kishi government, and force the passage of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. To this end, the United States sent Hagerty to Japan in advance to make arrangements; Kishi Nobusuke, in order to ensure Eisenhower's "safety," did not hesitate to create the "June 15th" bloody massacre. However, the development of events was completely contrary to the wishes of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Kishi Nobusuke. The Japanese people, with their heroic and tenacious struggle, overturned Eisenhower's visit to Japan plan, causing this plague god to suffer a head-on blow as soon as he left the country, and he was unable to reverse the defeat of his entire Far East trip.

Eisenhower spent the past week in fearful tension. The trip to the Philippines was carried out under the strict "protection" of special agents, police, and troops. The frontline troops in Fujian, China, held an armed anti-American demonstration, expressing the Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower, and supporting the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, as well as the Japanese and Korean people, against Eisenhower's bandit trip. The surging anti-American demonstrations of 100,000 people in Okinawa frightened Eisenhower so much that he did not dare to stay long and slipped away early. The Korean people excitedly shouted the slogan "Eisenhower, get back home!" and held anti-American demonstrations everywhere. U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things, continuing to enslave the Philippines, occupying Okinawa, riding on the heads of the Japanese people, staying in South Korea, and occupying China's territory of Taiwan. All of this cannot but arouse the deep hatred of the people of the Far East. Eisenhower's sweet talk cannot eliminate the bloody hatred of the people of the Far East against U.S. imperialism.

The great anti-American patriotic struggle rising in the Far East is severely打击打打击打击striking at U.S. imperialism's war policy, striking at U.S. imperialism's enslavement plan, and throwing the U.S. ruling clique into a panic. The "Wall Street Journal" lamented: "From the American point of view, the trouble with this situation is that a considerable part of our retaliatory power (should be read as the power to carry out aggressive wars) is at the mercy of emotions and political forces beyond our control." The "New York Post" also pointed out: "Our (American) bases are also becoming more and more insecure along with the governments that provide the bases." These words are completely correct. After World War II, especially after the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, U.S. imperialism invested a huge bet in the Far East. From 1950 to 1959, in the ten years, military aid to Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan alone amounted to more than four billion U.S. dollars; the United States has 390,000 invading troops stationed in these places, in addition to two huge fleets and air forces. However, all of this has neither been able to protect its running dogs, nor has it been able to protect its war system. This is not because its running dogs have not worked hard for their masters, nor is it because the U.S. armed forces are not strong enough, but because U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are both "paper tigers." They appear to be powerful, but in reality, they are decadent, declining, and destined to perish. The law of historical development does not depend on their will. The masses of the people, when they have not yet awakened and united, seem to be weak and are often looked down upon by imperialism and all reactionaries. But the masses of the people, who represent the new forces, are invincible. Only the masses of the people are the creators of history and the decisive force in historical development. When the people of the Far East have suffered enough from the oppression and enslavement of U.S. imperialism, awaken, and unite to struggle, when the people of the Far East rise up to oppose the U.S. policy of aggression and war, refuse to be cannon fodder for new wars for U.S. imperialism, and refuse to provide war bases, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will be trapped in the vast ocean of the masses of the people and will have to move from failure to failure, until death.

Whenever U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries encounter setbacks and failures in their policy of aggression and war, they always resort to spreading the lie of the so-called "communist threat" to extricate themselves from their predicament. This time, naturally, is no exception. Eisenhower openly attributed the great failure of U.S. imperialism in the Far East to the Chinese people, saying that "the Chinese Communists are responsible." U.S. officials and propaganda machines also clamored at the same time, describing the anti-American patriotic struggles of the Japanese and South Korean people as the result of "foreign influence," shouting about the so-called "Chinese threat."

Yes, we Chinese people, deeply harmed by U.S. imperialism, have seen through the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism from long-term struggles, insisted on a tit-for-tat struggle, exposed and打击打打击打击struck at U.S. imperialism's war policy and policy of aggression, and despised and disdained U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialism's trick of playing a "peace" game cannot deceive us; the U.S. imperialism's waving of atomic and hydrogen bombs, implementing the so-called "deterrence policy" and "brinkmanship policy," cannot scare us. The Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism, as well as the great struggle of the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp against U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, cannot but be a major source of encouragement for all the oppressed people in the Far East and other regions of the world who have suffered from U.S. imperialism's aggression. However, it would be absurd to attribute the anti-American patriotic struggles of the Japanese and South Korean people, as well as the people of other countries in the Far East and the world, entirely to the influence of the Chinese people and the socialist countries' struggle against imperialism. The fundamental reason why the Japanese and South Korean people and the people of other countries in the Far East are carrying out anti-American patriotic struggles is that U.S. imperialism is deceiving them, invading them, and enslaving them. If they have been influenced by external forces, then this influence does not come from elsewhere, but primarily from U.S. imperialism, from its long-standing policy of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism is the best negative teacher for the people of the Far East. Today, the places where opposition to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is most acute and intense are precisely the places where U.S. imperialism has controlled the longest and oppressed the most. It is U.S. imperialism that has forced the people there to rise up in resistance. Sooner or later, U.S. imperialism will be buried in the increasingly raging anti-American flames of the people of the Far East and all over the world.

The historical wheels of the Far East are speeding forward! Today's Far East is no longer the Far East where U.S. imperialism runs rampant, but the Far East where the people of the Far East have risen up to oppose the American aggressors. The people of the Far East unite, form a united front against U.S. imperialism, and drive the American bandits out of the Far East!

### 请看今日之远东，竟是谁家之天下

    请看今日之远东，竟是谁家之天下
    是帝国主义厉害？还是人民群众厉害？人们从天字第一号的帝国主义——美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔远东之行中，可以得出明确的答案。
    艾森豪威尔的远东之行，已经以可耻的失败而结束了。过去的一周是轰动世界的一周。甚至西方的报刊也认为，艾森豪威尔的远东之行，是“自从第二次世界大战以来（对美国）的最严重打击”，它标志着“美国远东外交政策的失败”。的确，除此以外，还能够得出什么与此相反的结论呢？今天的远东已经不是美国强盗的乐园了。受美帝国主义深重压迫的远东人民再也不能忍受下去了。
    美国统治集团在艾森豪威尔出发之前，并非不知道他此行充满着“风险”。在南朝鲜、土耳其、日本人民掀起的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的浪潮里，李承晚和曼德列斯先后倒台，岸信介政府也处在风雨飘摇之中，美国在远东的侵略阵线面临着整个崩溃的危险。艾森豪威尔明知大事不好，还要硬着头皮前来，企图稳住它在远东的侵略阵地。一贯狂妄自大的美帝国主义，原以为艾森豪威尔亲自出马，再加上美国海空军的耀武扬威，总可以挽狂澜于既倒。可是，美帝国主义同其他帝国主义和一切反动派一样，永远不可能对客观形势作出正确的估计，总是过高地估计自己的力量，过低地估计人民的力量。这样，艾森豪威尔就自找苦吃来了。
    艾森豪威尔原来这次远东之行的主要的赌注押在日本之行上面。这是因为美帝国主义一直把日本军国主义当成它在远东进行侵略的可靠帮凶，而日本人民最近一个时间的英勇斗争又威胁着它在亚洲的整个侵略战争计划。岸信介政府和美国政府不顾日本人民的反对，直到最后一刻还坚持艾森豪威尔访日，就是妄想扑灭日本人民反抗的烈火，为支持摇摇欲坠的岸政府和强迫通过美日军事同盟条约施加影响。为此，美国派了哈格蒂先到日本早做安排；岸信介为确保艾森豪威尔的“安全”，竟不惜制造“六·一五”的血腥屠杀。但是，事情的发展完全同美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的愿望相反。日本人民以英勇顽强的斗争，推翻了艾森豪威尔的访日计划，使得这位瘟神甫出国门，就遭到迎头一棒，再也无法挽回整个远东之行的败局。
    艾森豪威尔在惶恐的紧张中度过了过去的一周。菲律宾之行是在特务、警察和军队的严密“保护”下进行的。中国福建前线部队举行了反美武装大示威，表示了中国人民对于艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视，支持了台、澎、金、马爱国同胞和日本人民、朝鲜人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。冲绳十万人民的汹涌澎湃的反美大示威，吓得艾森豪威尔不敢久留，提前溜走。朝鲜人民激昂地高呼“艾森豪威尔滚回老家去”的口号，到处举行了反美示威。美帝国主义做尽了一切坏事，继续奴役菲律宾，霸占冲绳，骑在日本人民头上作威作福，赖在南朝鲜不走，侵占了中国的领土台湾。所有这一些，不能不引起远东各国人民的切齿痛恨。艾森豪威尔任何花言巧语，都消除不了远东各国人民对美帝国主义的血海深仇。
    远东各国人民兴起的反美爱国的伟大斗争，沉重地打击着美帝国主义的战争政策，打击着美帝国主义的奴役计划，使美国统治集团陷于一片慌乱之中。“华尔街日报”悲叹说：“从美国的观点看来，这种局势的麻烦处，在于我们相当一部分报复力量（应读作进行侵略战争的力量）是受到我们所不能控制的情绪和政治力量摆布的”。“纽约邮报”也指出：“我们（美国）的基地也随着提供基地的那些政府而变得越来越不保险了”。这些话说得完全正确。第二次世界大战以后，特别是在中国人民大革命胜利以后，美帝国主义在远东投下了巨大的赌注，从1950年到1959年的十年间，仅仅对日本、南朝鲜和台湾蒋介石集团的军事援助就达四十亿美元以上；美国在这些地方驻有三十九万侵略部队，另外还有两个庞大的舰队和空军。可是，所有这一切既没有能保住它的走狗，也不能保住它的战争体系。这并不是因为它的走狗没有为主子卖力，也并非因为美国这些武装力量还嫌不够，而是因为美帝国主义和它的走狗都是“纸老虎”，他们貌似强大，但实际上都是腐朽的、没落的、注定要走向灭亡的。历史的发展规律是不以他们的意志为转移的。人民群众，当他们还没有觉醒起来和团结起来的时候，似乎是弱小的，经常被帝国主义和一切反动派看不起的。但是代表新生力量的人民群众是不可战胜的。只有人民群众才是历史的创造者，才是历史发展的决定性力量。当远东各国人民受尽美帝国主义的压迫和奴役之苦，觉醒起来，团结斗争的时候，当远东各国人民起来反对美国侵略政策和战争政策，拒绝给美帝国主义充当新战争的炮灰，拒绝提供战争基地的时候，美帝国主义和它的走狗就会陷在人民群众的汪洋大海之中，不能不从失败走向失败，直到死亡。
    美帝国主义和一切反动派，每当它们的侵略政策和战争政策遭到挫折和失败，总是借助于散布所谓“共产主义威胁”的谎言，来解脱自己的困境。这一次自然也不例外。艾森豪威尔公然把美帝国主义在远东的大失败，归咎于中国人民，说什么要由“中国共产党人负责”。美国的官员和宣传机器也同时鼓噪，把日本人民、南朝鲜人民的反美爱国斗争，说成是由于“外国影响”的结果，大叫大嚷所谓“中国的威胁”。
    不错，我们中国人民，由于深受美帝国主义祸害，从长期斗争中看透了美帝国主义的侵略本质，坚持以针锋相对的斗争，揭露和打击美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，鄙视和蔑视美帝国主义。美帝国主义玩弄一套“和平”把戏，骗不过我们；美帝国主义挥舞原子弹和氢弹，实行所谓“威慑政策”和“战争边缘政策”，也吓不倒我们。中国人民坚持反对美帝国主义的正义斗争，以及整个社会主义阵营各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的伟大斗争，对于远东以及世界其他地区的深受美帝国主义侵略之害的一切被压迫的人民，不能不是一个重大的鼓舞力量。可是，如果把日本人民、南朝鲜人民以及远东和世界其他地区人民的反美爱国斗争，完全归因于中国人民和社会主义各国人民反对帝国主义斗争的影响，那是十分荒谬的。日本人民、南朝鲜人民以及远东其他国家人民之所以进行反美爱国斗争，根本的原因是美帝国主义欺骗他们，侵略他们，奴役他们。如果说他们受了外来影响的话，那么，这种影响不是来自别处，首先是来自美帝国主义，来自它长期以来推行的侵略政策和战争政策。美帝国主义是远东各国人民最好的反面教员。今天反对美帝国主义及其走狗最尖锐、最激烈的地方，正就是美帝国主义控制最久，压迫最重的地方。是美帝国主义迫使那里的人民不得不起来反抗。美帝国主义迟早终将葬身在远东以及全世界各国人民越烧越旺的反美烈火之中。
    远东的历史车轮正在向前飞驰！今日之远东已经不是美帝国主义横行霸道的远东，而是远东各国人民起来反对美国侵略者的远东了。远东各国人民团结起来，结成反对美帝国主义的统一战线，把美国强盗赶出远东去！
