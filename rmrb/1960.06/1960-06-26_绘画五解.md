    Five Explanations of Painting
    Chen Yi
    I visited the Japanese modern painting exhibition at the Palace Museum, and I was delighted by its unique style. I offer these explanations of painting to express my respect.
    Paint mountains, paint Mount Fuji. Paint the sea, paint the Sea of Japan. Then paint the Pacific Ocean, paint its changed appearance today.
    Paint the inevitable failure of the aggressors, paint the ultimate triumph of anti-aggression. Paint rats running across the street with everyone shouting "Kill them!", paint the sending away of the plague god, who pretends not to care. Paint the paper tiger that has been exposed, paint the internal disintegration of imperialism. Paint a storm of anti-colonialism, a picture that hundreds of millions of people will buy.
    Paint oppressors as poisonous weeds, being cut down; paint the friendship of the people as fragrant flowers, welcome to be picked collectively. Paint running dogs being driven off the stage, paint reactionary elements, not one of them not swaying.
    The painters themselves come from the people, painting the labor and creation of the people, is to make the painters themselves the masters of painting.
    Paint the great unity of the people of the world, paint the people seeking peace through struggle, this glorious cause will last for ten thousand years.

    绘画五解
    陈毅
    在故宫参观日本现代画展览，喜其具独特风格，作画解以致敬意。
    画山画富士山，画海画日本海。再画太平洋，画他而今面貌改。
    画侵略者必然失败，画反侵略终要奏凯。画老鼠过街人人喊打，画送瘟神，瘟神装着不睬。画纸老虎已被戳穿，画帝国主义内部正在分解。画一幅反殖民主义的风暴图，这张图亿万人要买。
    画压迫者似毒草，正被剪除；画人民友谊似香花，欢迎集采。画走狗都被撵下台，画反动分子没有一个不摇摆。
    画家自己都来自人民，画人民的劳动创造，就是使画家自己作绘画的主宰。
    画全世界人民大团结，画人民以斗争求和平，这事业辉煌万载。
