Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd - The Central Committee Cadre Meeting of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today, declaring that the so-called ratification instruments of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" exchanged by the Nobusuke Kishi government with the United States are invalid, and called on all democratic forces to struggle for the establishment of a caretaker government composed of all parliamentary forces other than the Nobusuke Kishi group.

The statement pointed out that the treaty's ratification instruments were secretly exchanged by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet with the United States amid the high tide of opposition from the Japanese people.

The statement said that the government's actions are invalid because the Japanese people have not agreed to the treaty; this illegal treaty should be abolished in the name of the Japanese people.

The statement, in mentioning the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and the traitorous Japanese reactionaries to undermine the achievements of the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty," pointed out that the reactionaries are preparing to send another Nobusuke Kishi to power so that the new prime minister can inherit Nobusuke Kishi's policy of strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance and intensifying the suppression of the people's democratic movement.

The statement said that the Communist Party will never allow this conspiracy to succeed.

"We have always advocated the formation of a caretaker government composed of all parliamentary forces other than the Kishi group. This is also the demand put forward by the overwhelming majority of the Japanese people."

The statement said, "Through the struggle against the Security Treaty, the Japanese people have established a solid foundation on which to promote and must promote the next stage of the struggle to smash the Security Treaty itself and the San Francisco Treaty system."

The statement pointed out, "The guarantee of victory in this struggle is the solid united front of all democratic forces."

The Japanese Communist Party called out, "Let us develop the unified movement that the democratic forces have been continuously carrying out into a great struggle to smash the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd - The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on all democratic forces to continue to launch unified action to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and establish a caretaker cabinet with the participation of all anti-Nobusuke Kishi forces.

The editorial pointed out that the democratic forces should currently prevent the conspiracy to establish a "second Kishi cabinet" from succeeding, and fight for the establishment of a caretaker cabinet with the participation of all anti-Kishi forces; resolutely declare the new "Security Treaty" invalid and unrecognized, and fight for the abolition of the "Security Treaty"; prepare so that all forces demanding the abolition of the "Security Treaty" will achieve victory in the upcoming general election.

    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天发表声明，宣布岸信介政府同美国交换的新日美“安全条约”的所谓批准书是无效的，并且号召所有民主力量为建立岸信介集团以外的一切议会力量组成的看守政府而斗争。
    声明指出，条约的批准书是岸信介内阁在日本人民反对的高潮中偷偷地同美国交换的。
    声明说，政府的这种行动是无效的，因为日本人民并没有同意这个条约；应当以日本人民的名义废除这项非法的条约。
    声明在提到美帝国主义者和卖国的日本反动派企图破坏日本人民反对新“安全条约”斗争的成就的阴谋时指出，反动派正在准备派另一个岸信介上台，以便使新首相继承岸信介关于加强日美军事同盟的政策和加强对人民民主运动的镇压。
    声明说，共产党永远不容许这种阴谋实现。
    “我们一直主张成立由岸集团以外的一切议会力量所组成的看守政府。这也是压倒多数的日本人民所提出的要求。”
    声明说，“通过反对安全条约的斗争，日本人民已经建立了巩固的基础，在这个基础上将促进和必须促进粉碎安全条约本身和旧金山和约体系的下一个阶段的斗争”。
    声明指出，“这种斗争胜利的保证是一切民主力量巩固的统一战线”。
    日本共产党号召说，“让我们把民主力量至今不断进行的统一运动发展成粉碎新美日安全条约的伟大斗争”。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召全体民主力量继续展开统一行动，为废除日美军事同盟条约，建立有所有反岸信介力量参加的看守内阁而斗争。
    社论指出，目前民主力量应当阻止成立“第二个岸内阁”的阴谋得逞，为建立有全体反岸力量参加的看守内阁而斗争；坚决宣布新“安全条约”无效和不予承认，为争取废除“安全条约”而斗争；作好准备，使要求废除“安全条约”的全体力量在即将到来的大选中取得胜利。
