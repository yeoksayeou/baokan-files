(Xinhua News Agency, June 14th) Textile industrial departments across the country are widely experimenting with spinning and weaving using wild and miscellaneous fibers, and have achieved significant results. According to preliminary statistics from nine provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Henan, over the past two months, more than 60 million *chi* (尺, a Chinese unit of length) of cloth has been produced by blending various wild and miscellaneous fibers with raw cotton, and more than 400 new varieties have been successfully trial-produced.

The types of wild and miscellaneous fibers used by cotton mills in various regions are very extensive, including more than 60 types such as cotton stalk peel, willow bark, birch bark, mangrove bark, mulberry bark, old tree bark, broad bean stalks, red wild hemp, flax, ramie, stinging nettle, reed sweetgrass, cattails, and *chedouhua* (车肚花). These wild and miscellaneous fibers are blended with raw cotton, waste cotton, rags, as well as cotton waste, broken seed cotton, and recovered silk from textile factories to weave industrial production fabrics, public use fabrics, and some clothing fabrics. In terms of industrial production fabrics, the main ones are packaging cloth, coarse cloth, and coarse canvas, which can be used to replace cotton cloth for packaging goods such as cotton, gauze, knitwear, and starch. Public use fabrics include plain cloth, denim, fine canvas, twill, hat lining, jacquard cloth, etc., which can be used to make work clothes, aprons, shoulder pads, foot protectors, hoppers, gloves, as well as car seats, schoolbags, mosquito nets, curtains, tablecloths, sofa covers, etc. for workers in various factories. These fabrics are sturdy, wear-resistant, and low in cost and price. Clothing fabrics include beautiful linen, corduroy, printed cloth, *maolan* cloth (毛兰布), gabardine, fiber cloth, herringbone overcoating, etc.

The mass production of these substitute fabrics can save the country a large amount of cotton and open up a new way for the textile industry to increase production. Baotou Fiber Factory has used wild hemp and cattails to produce 42,000 meters of machine packaging cloth and labor protection cloth, meeting the needs of Baogang (Baotou Steel). Shandong Province has established nine wild and miscellaneous fiber factories and twenty-four degumming workshops, which have already blended and spun more than 2,800 pieces of yarn, woven 2.19 million meters of substitute fabrics, and more than 170,000 sacks. These substitute fabrics are welcomed by the user units.

In order to meet the needs of spinning wild fibers, many textile factory workers in various regions are actively carrying out technical innovations, concentrating their efforts to overcome the "technical barriers" of wild and miscellaneous fibers. There are two difficulties in spinning wild fibers: one is peeling and loosening the fibers, and the other is degumming. At present, various regions have created some experiences in overcoming these two difficulties. For example, workers at the Baojing County Comprehensive Processing Factory in Hunan Province have made a semi-native, semi-foreign loosening machine powered by electricity. Two people operating it for one hour can loosen more than 300 *jin* (斤, a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg) of fiber, which is more than 100 times more efficient than manual operation. Due to the promotion of this advanced tool, the production of 398 wild plant processing factories in the county has risen sharply. Many cotton mills in Qingdao have used waste materials to manufacture peeling machines, dewatering machines, fiber beating machines, and other equipment, which has greatly improved production. At present, the city's twelve wild fiber degumming workshops and one degumming factory have more than 90 steamers and peeling machines, fiber beating machines, and other machines, which can process 750 *dan* (担, a Chinese unit of weight) of wild fiber every day. As technical barriers are gradually resolved, the blending ratio of wild fibers and the fineness of the spun yarn are also gradually increasing. The amount of wild and miscellaneous fibers added to every 100 *jin* of raw cotton has gradually increased from 20% at the beginning to about 30%-75%, and the fineness of the yarn has also increased from about 10 counts in the early stage to 21 counts, or even 36 counts.

Party committees in various regions attach great importance to the work of experimenting with spinning and weaving with wild and miscellaneous fibers. The vast majority of regions have held special meetings to study and deploy the utilization of wild and miscellaneous fibers, and have established wild fiber utilization offices. Currently, it is the peak season for wild fiber production, and while focusing on trial production, party committees in various regions are seizing the opportunity to focus on the collection and purchase of raw materials, preparing to launch a "small summer harvest" movement like last year's "small autumn harvest" movement. Some regions are already taking active actions. Under the personal command of the provincial party secretary, the masses in fifteen counties in Liaoning Province have gone to the mountains and the countryside to look for resources. In Gaiping County alone, 32,000 people were mobilized in two days to collect 2,300 *dan* of wild fibers. Hubei Province has organized more than 1,000 cadres and workers to go to Enshi, Xiangyang, Jingzhou, and other places to collect and transport raw materials. Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Hebei, and other regions have also transferred a large number of personnel from textile factories to go deep into the suburbs and nearby counties and communes to provide technical guidance on preliminary processing, and organized textile factories to be linked with communes to directly transport raw materials into factories.

    纺织工业广泛试用野杂纤维纺纱织布
    北京、上海、河北、山东等九省市织成六千多万尺布，试制成功四百多个新品种
    各地积极准备开展采集和收购野杂纤维的“小夏收”运动
    新华社14日讯　全国各地纺织工业部门广泛试用野杂纤维纺纱织布，已取得显著成绩。据北京、上海、河北、山东、湖北、湖南、四川、江苏及河南九个省市的初步统计，近两个月来利用各种野杂纤维与原棉混纺制成的布匹就有六千多万市尺，试制成功四百多个新品种。
    各地棉纺厂利用野杂纤维的种类十分广泛。有棉秆皮、柳树皮、桦香树皮、红树皮、桑树皮、老树皮、蚕豆秆、红野麻、胡麻、羌麻、螫麻、龙须草、蒲草、车肚花等六十多种。这些野杂纤维与原棉、废棉、破布以及纺织厂的下脚棉、破籽棉、回丝等混纺后织成的有工业生产用布、公共用布与一部分衣着用布。在工业生产用布方面，主要有包装布、粗布与粗帆布，可以用来代替棉布包装棉花、纱布、针织品、淀粉等货物。公共用布有平纹布、劳动布、细帆布、斜纹布、帽子衬布、提花布等等，用它可以做各种工厂里工人穿的工作服、围裙、垫肩、护脚、提斗、手套以及车座、书包、蚊帐、窗帘、台布、沙发套等，质地坚实，耐磨，成本、价格又低廉。衣着用布有漂亮的麻细布、条子绒布、花色布、毛兰布、华达呢、纤维呢、人字大衣呢等。
    这些代用布的大批生产，可为国家节省大量棉花，给纺织工业增产开辟了一条新的途径。包头纤维厂已利用野麻、蒲草生产了四万二千米机器包装布及劳动用品布，供应了包钢的需要。山东省建立了九个野杂纤维厂、二十四个脱胶车间，已经混合纺纱二千八百多件，织成代用布二百一十九万米，麻袋十七万余条。这些代用布受到使用单位的欢迎。
    为了适应纺织野生纤维的需要，各地许多纺织厂职工积极进行技术革新，集中力量猛攻野杂纤维的“技术关”。纺织野生纤维的难关有两个，一个是剥皮弹松纤维，另一个是脱胶。目前各地已创造了一些攻克这两道难关的经验。如湖南省保靖县综合加工厂工人制成了一种半土半洋、用电力带动的疏松机，两个人操作一小时，就能疏松纤维三百多斤，比手工操作提高效率一百多倍，全县三百九十八个野生植物加工厂由于推广了这种先进工具，生产直线上升。青岛市许多棉纺厂利用废旧材料制造了剥皮机、脱水机、打纤维机等设备，使生产很快提高。目前，全市十二个野生纤维脱胶车间与一个脱胶厂拥有九十多个蒸锅及剥皮机、打纤维机等机器，每天可以处理七百五十担野生纤维。由于技术关逐步解决，各地利用野生纤维的混纺比例与纺出的细度也逐步提高。每百斤原棉掺用野杂纤维已由开始时的20％。逐渐增加到30％—75％左右，纱的细度也由初期的十支左右，提高到二十一支，甚至三十六支了。
    各地党委对试用野杂纤维纺纱织布的工作都十分重视。绝大多数地区召开了专门会议对野杂纤维的利用进行研究与布置，并建立了野生纤维利用办公室。目前正是野生纤维盛产季节，各地党委一边大抓试制工作，一边抓紧时机大抓原料采集与收购，准备开展一个像去年“小秋收”运动一样的“小夏收”运动。现在有些地区已积极行动起来。辽宁省在省委书记亲自指挥下，有十五个县的群众已上山下乡，寻找资源。仅盖平县两天内即发动群众三万二千人，采集野生纤维二千三百担。湖北省已组织干部、工人一千余人，分赴恩施、襄阳、荆州等地采集、调运原料。北京、上海、辽宁、河北等地区，还从纺织工厂抽调了大批力量深入郊区与附近县、社进行初步加工的技术指导，组织纺织厂与公社挂钩，直接把原料运进工厂。（附图片）
