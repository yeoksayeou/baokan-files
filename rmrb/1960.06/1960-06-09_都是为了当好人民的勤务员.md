In My Position

	"All for Being a Good Servant of the People"
	Hou San, Representative of the National Cultural and Educational Heroes Congress, General Services Staff Member of Chengguan Town Primary School, Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia

	I come from a poor peasant background and started working at the age of seven. At twenty, I overworked myself and lost sight in one eye. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao brought me light and happiness.

	In 1952, I started working as a general service staff member at Chengguan Town Primary School in Qingshuihe County, and I have now been honorably approved as a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party. In the old society, I was an illiterate blind man, but now I have not only shed the label of illiteracy, but I can also read newspapers, write notes, keep accounts, and use an abacus. All these skills were bestowed upon me by the Party and Chairman Mao.

	I love the school and my work. Every day after school, I always check the doors and windows of all the classrooms, so there have been no incidents of broken glass due to improperly closed doors or windows in recent years. At the same time, after school every day, I always take a walk around the schoolyard and playground, and put all the sports equipment and teaching aids back in the storeroom, so there are no scattered items to be seen in the schoolyard. I pick up every piece of firewood, every nail, every piece of chalk, and every piece of hemp rope in the schoolyard. Over the years, the chalk stubs I have collected can supply all the teachers in the school for more than two months; the old nails I have collected can meet the school's needs for repairing desks and benches. I have used old wood to make two drinking water room doors, two toilet doors, six pickaxe handles, and one rake. I have also built a partition wall in the office and a back wall for the drinking water room. Over the years, I have whitewashed the offices and teachers' dormitories dozens of times; all the school's more than two hundred and thirty stove pipes are repaired by me every year, saving the school expenses. I often pay attention to repairing walls that are about to collapse, patching roof tiles, and repairing and dredging waterways. All the trees in the school are pruned by me, and the pruned branches solve the problem of firewood for the whole school every year. In order to save coal for the country, I distribute coal to each class according to the principle of "burn more when it's very cold, burn less when it's slightly cold, and don't burn when it's not cold," and I use sifted coal to boil water, saving the school 8,000 to 10,000 catties of coal every year. At the same time, I have explored a set of methods for saving firewood and starting fires quickly, solving the problem of students making black smoke when starting fires, not being able to start fires, and wasting firewood.

	I believe that it is not enough to just work hard and practically; one must also work cleverly. If one cannot rationally arrange various tasks and cannot scientifically utilize time in a planned way, even if one has eight hands and works day and night, the amount of work one can do will always be limited. Take my work for example. After getting up in the morning, I first sweep the yard, tidy up the classrooms and offices, boil water for the teachers and students to wash their faces, and deliver boiled water. I have to ring the bell more than twenty times every day; I am on guard duty all year round at night; I also have to distribute more than one hundred newspapers and magazines subscribed to by the teachers and students of the whole school every day; the school's newspapers and magazines also have to be bound by month; and I also have to go to the street on time to buy food and vegetables for the school. If some students get bumped or fall, applying medicine and bandaging is also my job. If there are any new clerks, I also have to help them familiarize themselves with the business and the school situation; I also have to squeeze out some time to cultivate the experimental field and grow vegetables, and so on. In winter, I distribute coal and firewood to teachers and students every day, and light stoves for classrooms, offices, and first and second grade students... With so much work, if I don't plan very well to complete them one by one, even the most skilled person will not be able to finish it. Therefore, in order to save time and improve work efficiency, when I sweep the yard in the morning, I sweep while blowing the wake-up whistle. When delivering boiled water from the kitchen to the office, I carry water while tidying up the things that are randomly placed in the yard. When ringing the bell, I ring the bell while peeling 芁 (wild grass used to make brooms). When buying food and vegetables for the school, I take the opportunity to do some private errands for the teachers' families (buying food, vegetables, or other daily necessities). On Sundays, I paint all eighteen blackboards in the school once. During the winter and summer vacations, I have to prepare everything for the start of school, such as: repairing desks and benches, organizing items, repairing and painting the walls of dormitories and classrooms, tying brooms, painting blackboards, and so on. In terms of safekeeping, I usually have to pay attention to putting every item I keep, even a small piece of wood or a nail, in a fixed place, so that when teachers and students come to collect things, they can get them easily. For some foreseeable sudden tasks, such as: cleaning up after heavy snow in winter; repairing the waterways in the schoolyard during the rainy season, and checking for potentially leaking or collapsing houses and walls; necessary preparations and preventive work must be carried out in advance.

	Some people in the school call me a handyman, some say I am a keeper, a purchaser, a health worker, a security guard, and so on. I think, whether it is this worker or that worker, it is all for being a good servant of the people. I think that doing any work is the same, and from the perspective of working methods, one should work hard, practically, and cleverly, and from the perspective of thinking, one should work wholeheartedly.

    “都是为了当好人民的勤务员”
    内蒙古清水河县城关镇小学工勤员全国文教群英会代表  侯三
    我是贫农出身，七岁就开始劳动，二十岁上因劳累过度把一只眼睛累瞎了。解放后党和毛主席给我带来了光明和幸福。
    我在1952年到清水河县城关镇小学担任工勤工作，现在已光荣的被批准为中共预备党员。在旧社会我是一个大字不识的睁眼瞎子，现在不但摘掉了文盲帽子，而且能读书看报，能写便条，会记账、打算盘。这一切本领，都是党和毛主席赐给的。
    我热爱学校，热爱工作，每天放学后，我总要查看一下全校教室的门窗，所以几来年没出现过门窗没关好而引起打坏玻璃的现象。同时我在每天放学后总要到校院、操场上去走一趟，把运动工具、教学用具全收拾到库房里，所以在校院里根本看不见有流散的东西。校院的一片木柴、一个铁钉、一个粉笔头、一条麻绳我都把它拣回来。几年来我收集起来的粉笔头可供给全校教师使用两个多月；收拾的旧铁钉能满足学校平时修理桌凳使用。我曾利用旧木料作饮水房门两扇、厕所门两扇、洋镐柄六个、耧耙一个，砌起办公室隔墙一道，饮水房后墙一道。几年来我一个人用白泥粉刷办公室、教师宿舍数十次；全校二百三十多节火炉筒年年由我修理，给学校节省了开支。我经常注意修整即将倒塌的墙头，修补房皮瓦顶，整修疏通水道。学校的树全由我来剪枝，剪下来的枝条解决了每年全校生火用柴的问题。为了给国家节省用煤，本着“大冷多烧，小冷少烧，不冷不烧”的原则给各班分配煤炭，用筛料炭烧开水，每年为学校节约煤炭八千到一万斤，同时摸索出生火炉省木柴、起火快的一套方法，解决了同学们生火炉冒黑烟，不起火、又费柴的困难。
    我认为工作仅仅苦干、实干是不够的，还必须加一个巧干。如果不能合理地安排各种工作，不能有计划地科学地利用时间，一个人就是长着八只手，白天黑夜干，干的活也总是有限的。就说我的工作吧，早晨起床后先打扫院落，收拾教室、办公室，给全校师生烧洗脸水，送开水；每天要准时打钟二十多次；夜里常年担任保卫工作；每天还要分发全校师生所订的一百多份报纸杂志；学校的报纸杂志还要按月份装订起来；还要按时上街给学校买粮食买菜。如果有的学生碰伤、摔伤，上药、包扎也是我的事儿；若有新来的事务员还要帮助他熟悉业务和学校情况；还要挤出点时间整修试验田，种菜等等。到了冬天，每天给师生发煤炭、发劈柴，给教室、办公室和一、二年级小同学生炉子，……这么多的工作，如果不很好的计划着一样一样去完成，本事再高明的人也作不完。所以为了节约时间，提高工作效率，我在早晨打扫院子的时候，就一边扫，一边吹起床哨。从伙房给办公室送开水时就一边提水，一边收拾院内乱放着的东西。打钟时，就一边打钟，一边剥?芁（做笤帚用的野草）。给学校买粮食买菜时，就捎着把教师家属的私事办一下（买粮、买菜或其他日用品）。星期天就把全校十八块黑板都涂刷一次。寒暑假期间就要把开学用的一切东西都准备好，如：修理桌凳，整理物品，修补粉刷寝室、教室的墙壁，扎笤帚、刷黑板等等。保管工作平时就得注意把所保管的每一件东西，那怕是一块小木板，一只钉子，都要放在固定的地方，当师生来领东西时，顺手就能拿到。有些可以预料到的突击性的工作，如：冬天下大雪后的清扫工作；雨季时校舍操场通水道的整修工作，清查可能漏水、倒塌的房、屋墙壁等等；都要事先进行必要的准备和预防工作。
    学校里有的称我是勤杂员，有的说我是保管员、采购员、卫生员、保卫员等等。我想，不管是这个员还是那个员，都是为了当好人民的勤务员。我认为作什么工作都是一样，从工作方法上应该苦干、实干、巧干，从思想上要全心全意的干。
