Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 11th: The Italian people's struggle to improve their living and working conditions is unfolding widely throughout the country.

    The three-day mass demonstration of 400,000 tenant farmers across Italy, which began on June 6th, ended on June 9th. The tenant farmers demanded that the rent paid to landowners should not exceed 47% of the harvest and that landowners should bear more of the cost of improving the land.

    One hundred thousand agricultural workers in Ferrara province went on strike on June 8th, demanding general wage increases and improved working conditions. The day before, all agricultural workers in Modena province also went on strike, making the same demands.

    While agricultural workers are intensifying their struggle, industrial workers are also holding strikes. Workers in three factories of the giant chemical trust "Montecatini Chemical United Factory" and in several joint state-private enterprises, particularly the famous automobile factory "Alfa Romeo Factory," have gone on strike. In industrial enterprises in Naples, the time spent on strike in the past three months has been equivalent to 200,000 hours. In Bologna, 10,000 female workers who work at home for the garment industry went on strike on June 10th, demanding wage increases and recognition of their right to social insurance.

    Eighteen thousand workers in the Italian cement monopoly also held a nationwide 24-hour strike, demanding the conclusion of new collective contracts. Ten thousand workers in six factories of the giant textile industry "Lanerossi" also went on strike for 24 hours.
