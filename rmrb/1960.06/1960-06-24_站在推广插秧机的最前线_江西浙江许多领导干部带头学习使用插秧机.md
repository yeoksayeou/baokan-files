Standing at the Forefront of Rice Transplanter Promotion
Jiangxi and Zhejiang Many Leading Cadres Take the Lead in Learning to Use Rice Transplanters

    (Our report) Responsible comrades from relevant departments in Jiangxi Province personally went to the fields and took the lead in learning to use rice transplanters in the rain.

    Zhou Zhenyuan, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, Shao Ming, Deputy Director of the Provincial Women's Federation, Sheng Pu, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Li Deyou, Director of the Provincial Department of Agricultural Machinery, Dong Yutian, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Huang Mulan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other leading comrades from relevant departments, enthusiastically went barefoot into the fields to transplant rice in the rain on June 9th. Comrade Zhou Zhenyuan humbly learned machine transplanting techniques from his instructor, Gan Jilian, the production team leader and machine transplanting expert from the Hubian Commune in Gan County, and carefully studied the structure and manufacturing methods of the rice transplanter. The rice transplanted by him using the transplanter was fast and straight, and Gan Jilian praised him repeatedly. Shao Ming, Deputy Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Women's Federation, and Comrade Huang Mulan, along with other comrades, took off their shoes and socks, rolled up their trousers, and went into the fields to transplant rice in the rain. Sheng Pu, Director of the Department of Agriculture, closely followed his "master" – Luo Jumei, a rice transplanting expert from the Gaolong Commune in Taihe County – learning and transplanting simultaneously.

    In the afternoon, the provincial responsible comrades who participated in learning to transplant rice with rice transplanters became increasingly interested and continued to transplant rice in the rain. Several responsible comrades even held a competition.

    During the period of learning to use rice transplanters, the leading comrades exchanged opinions cordially with their instructors. They hoped that the broad masses of cadres would stand at the forefront of using rice transplanters, so that rice transplanters could be promoted and used on a larger scale throughout the province.

    (Our report) Zhejiang Province is vigorously promoting rice transplanters in early rice transplanting. After the completion of early rice transplanting, mass summary and appraisal activities were generally carried out in various places to summarize and exchange experiences in using rice transplanters. On the basis of summarizing and appraising, various places have further focused on technical training, rice transplanter manufacturing, and repair work. The Ningbo area has trained more than 10,000 key rice transplanter operators. Many counties in the Wenzhou and Jinhua areas have increased their efforts in manufacturing rice transplanters.

    The large-scale promotion and use of rice transplanters is a major innovation in agricultural production in Zhejiang Province. During the promotion process, various places have been led by the secretaries, and the whole Party has been mobilized to vigorously grasp ideological mobilization, criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas and habitual forces, and improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses for using rice transplanters. Many secretaries of the prefectural and county Party committees and secretaries of the commune Party committees first learned the operating techniques, took the lead in using them, and set an example. In Jiande County, everyone from the county Party secretary and commune Party secretaries to the production team branch secretaries learned to use rice transplanters. Many cadres not only learned operating techniques but also learned repair techniques and served as teachers of technology. Leaders at all levels also focused on advanced models, established pacesetters, learned from experience, visited experts, summarized and promoted advanced operating experience, and constantly solved various problems in use, giving full play to the role of rice transplanters.

    During the spring plowing and transplanting, various places in Zhejiang opened short-term training classes and trained more than 290,000 rice transplanter operators, most of whom met the requirements of "knowing how to explain, knowing how to use, and knowing how to repair." Through the actual operation of spring transplanting, most of the novices have become skilled veterans, and a large number of high-efficiency machine transplanting experts have emerged in various places. In the Ningbo area alone, 2,999 high-efficiency experts who can transplant five to seven mu per day have been cultivated, and seventy people have reached more than ten mu per day. (Attached picture)

    站在推广插秧机的最前线
    江西浙江许多领导干部带头学习使用插秧机
    本报讯　江西省有关部门负责同志，亲临田间冒雨带头学习使用插秧机。
    共青团江西省委书记周振远，省妇联副主任邵鸣，省农业厅厅长盛朴，省农业机械厅厅长李德友，省农业厅副厅长董雨田，中国科学院江西分院副秘书长黄木兰等各有关部门领导同志，在6月9日个个兴致勃勃地赤脚冒雨下田插秧。周振远同志虚心地向他的辅导员——赣县湖边公社生产队长、机插能手甘继莲学习机插技术，并认真研究插秧机的结构和制造方法。他使用插秧机插的秧又快又直，甘继莲连连称好。江西省妇联副主任邵鸣和黄木兰同志，和其他同志一道，脱掉鞋袜，卷起裤腿，冒雨下田插秧。农业厅长盛朴一步不离地跟着他的
  “师傅”——泰和县高陇公社插秧能手罗菊妹，边学边插。
    下午，参加学习用插秧机插秧的省负责同志，兴趣越来越浓，继续冒雨插秧。几位负责同志还展开比赛。
    在学习使用插秧机期间，领导同志跟他们的辅导员亲切的交换意见。他们希望广大干部都站在使用插秧机的最前线，使插秧机更大规模地在全省范围内推广使用。
    本报讯　浙江各地在早稻插秧中大力推广插秧机。早稻插秧结束以后，各地普遍进行了群众性的总结评比，总结交流了使用插秧机的经验。在总结评比的基础上，各地进一步大抓技术训练、插秧机的制造和检修工作。宁波地区已训练了插秧机手骨干一万多名。温州地区和金华地区许多县纷纷增加制造插秧机的力量。
    大量推广、使用插秧机，是浙江省农业生产中的重大革新。在推广中，各地都由书记挂帅，全党动手，大抓思想发动，批判了各种右倾保守思想和习惯势力，提高了广大群众使用插秧机的积极性。不少地委、县委书记和公社党委书记首先学会操作技术，带头使用，做出样子。建德县从县委书记、公社党委书记直到生产队支部书记都学会了使用插秧机。许多干部不但学会操作技术，而且学会了修理技术，担任了传授技术的教师。各级领导还狠抓先进，树立标兵，取经访贤，总结推广先进的操作经验，不断解决使用中的各种问题，充分发挥插秧机的作用。
    在春耕插秧中，浙江各地都开办了短期训练班，训练了二十九万多名插秧机操作手，其中大部分达到“会讲、会用、会修理”的要求。通过春插的实际操作，大部分新手都成为熟练的老手，各地都涌现了大批高工效机插能手。仅宁波地区就培养出了日插五亩至七亩以上的高工效能手二千九百九十九人，有七十人达到日插十亩以上。（附图片）
