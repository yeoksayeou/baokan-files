The American running dog in Japan, Nobusuke Kishi, under the firm opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, was forced to announce his resignation yesterday. This is a new victory for the Japanese people in their anti-American, anti-Kishi struggle! It is a new inspiration for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are struggling against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys!

The downfall of the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous government is the result of the continuous struggle of the heroic Japanese people. Kishi's downfall proves once again that the Japanese people, as long as they strengthen their unity and persist in the struggle, are capable of defeating the reactionaries. The Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will surely be victorious.

It is worth noting that Kishi was forced to offer his resignation after he had secretly "completed" the "legislative procedures" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" by using all despicable means, and after the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries had secretly "exchanged" the "instruments of ratification" of this treaty. In his statement of forced resignation, Kishi made no secret of the fact that he did so "in order to take the opportunity of the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. Security Treaty to refresh the people's minds," in order to "change the political situation" and "forcefully promote new policies." U.S. government officials also clearly stated that they "hoped" Kishi would only "continue in power until the treaty (Japan-U.S. military alliance) came into effect." The U.S. propaganda machine even more bluntly complained that "Kishi's unpopularity among many Japanese has affected the U.S. government," believing that Kishi had "become a burden to the United States, just as the ousted Syngman Rhee had become a burden in South Korea." It can be seen that Kishi's downfall also conceals a conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. After completing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, they do not hesitate to abandon Kishi as a running dog in order to ease the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, shift the target of the struggle, and thereby maintain the Liberal Democratic Party's regime and preserve the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. However, this kind of conspiracy is not beyond the expectations of the Japanese and Chinese people. This newspaper once pointed out that U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital might sacrifice Kishi in exchange for the establishment of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and attempt to ease the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people. Japanese progressive public opinion has also issued warnings about this. In the face of the Japanese people who have been tempered in a long struggle, the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is difficult to succeed. Sanzo Nosaka, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, called on the Japanese people of all walks of life on the 22nd to be vigilant and prevent the emergence of a second Kishi cabinet. The Japanese Socialist Party has also issued a warning that if the government forcibly approves the "Security Treaty" and does not dissolve the Diet, but attempts to privately transfer power and muddle through the current political situation, Japanese workers and the masses will further rise up and launch a powerful struggle. The fact that the broad masses of the Japanese people, after winning the victory of forcing Kishi to step down, have expressed their determination to fight to the end to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is a good proof.

Now, although the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have imposed the "exchange" of the "instruments of ratification" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on the Japanese people, everyone knows that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which is strongly opposed by the entire Japanese people, has not been approved by the Japanese people. The Japanese people will not allow the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to use this treaty to impose endless war disasters and enslavement shackles on themselves. The "June 22" general strike was a new and heavy blow to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. This political general strike was participated in by 6.2 million workers from 111 industrial sectors, reaching about 85% of the organized workers in Japan, and was firmly supported by shop closures, teacher strikes, student strikes, government employees holding workplace meetings, and practical actions of people from all walks of life. This general strike was larger in scale, longer in duration, and more tightly organized than any previous general strike, demonstrating the powerful force and extremely firm fighting will of the Japanese people. This can never be shaken or changed by any suppression or deception by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

Today, even the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, has to admit that "the future prospects of the Security Treaty and U.S. military bases in Japan will depend on the will of the Japanese people." Due to the unprecedented surge of anti-American sentiment in Japan and the unparalleled strength of the Japanese people's fighting will, U.S. public opinion circles are generally worried that it may be "substantially difficult" to maintain the new "Security Treaty" and U.S. military bases in the future. Hans Thomsen, a reporter for United Press International, openly asked how much value the new "Security Treaty" has in the current situation. Indeed, as long as the Japanese people firmly disapprove of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, persist in the struggle, and refuse to implement this treaty, then it is entirely possible to finally abolish this treaty with the power of the people.

The struggle of the Japanese people has overthrown Eisenhower's plan to "visit" Japan and forced the traitor Nobusuke Kishi to shamefully announce his resignation. One victory after another will further inspire the Japanese people to fight to the end for the complete abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

### 日本人民的新胜利

    日本人民的新胜利
    美国在日本的走卒岸信介，在广大日本人民的坚决反对下，已不得不在昨天被迫宣布下台。这是日本人民反美反岸斗争的一个新胜利！对于正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，是一个新的鼓舞！
    岸信介卖国政府的垮台，是英雄的日本人民持续不断地进行斗争的结果。岸信介的垮台，又一次证明了：日本人民只要加强团结，坚持斗争，是能够击败反动派的。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争，是一定能够获得胜利的。
    值得注意的是，岸信介是在他使用一切卑鄙手段偷偷“完成”了新日美“安全条约”的“立法手续”之后，是在美日反动派偷偷“互换”了这个条约的“批准书”之后，才在人民的压力下被迫提出辞职的。岸信介在他被迫下台的声明中，毫不讳言他这样做是“为了借新日美安全条约批准的机会，使人心一新”，为了“改变政治局势”、“强有力地推进新的政策”。美国政府官员也明白表示“希望”岸信介只“继续掌权到（日美军事同盟）条约生效时为止”。而美国的宣传机器更为露骨地埋怨，“岸信介在许多日本人当中的不得人心已经影响到美国政府”，认为岸信介已经“变成了美国的一个负担，就像已经被赶下台的李承晚在南朝鲜成为一个负担一样”。可见，岸信介的下台，也隐藏着美日反动派的一个阴谋。他们在完成了日美军事同盟条约之后，就不惜抛弃岸信介这一条走狗，来缓和日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争、转移斗争目标，借以维护自由民主党的政权，保全日美军事同盟条约。然而，这种阴谋，并不是在日本人民和中国人民的预料之外的事。本报就曾经指出，美帝国主义和日本垄断资本可能牺牲岸信介以换取日美军事同盟条约的成立，并企图以此缓和日本人民的不满。日本进步的舆论界也对此提出了警告。在经过了长期斗争锻炼的日本人民面前，美日反动派的阴谋是难以得逞的。日本共产党主席野坂参三22日已呼吁日本各界人民提高警惕，阻止第二个岸信介内阁的出现。日本社会党也为此发出警告，假如政府强行批准“安全条约”、又不解散国会，而企图私相授受政权，在当前政治形势下蒙混过去的话，日本工人、国民群众将进一步奋起展开强有力的斗争。而广大日本人民在获得迫使岸信介下台的胜利以后，纷纷表示坚决要为废除日美军事同盟条约斗争到底，就是一个很好的证明。
    现在，尽管美日反动派把“互换”日美军事同盟条约的“批准书”强加在日本人民的头上；但是，谁都知道，遭到日本全体人民强烈反对的新日美“安全条约”，是没有得到日本人民批准的。日本人民不会听任美日反动派利用这个条约，把无穷的战争灾难和奴役枷锁强加到自己的头上。“六·二二”总罢工，就是对于美日反动派的一个新的沉重的打击。这一次政治性的总罢工，参加的有一百一十一个产业部门的六百二十万工人，达到日本全国有组织工人的85％左右，并且得到各地商店罢市、学校教员罢教、学生罢课、政府职工召开工作场所大会，以及各界人民实际行动的坚决支持。这次总罢工比过去历次举行的总罢工规模更大、时间更长、组织得更严密，显示了日本人民的强大威力和无比坚强的斗争意志。这绝不是美日反动派任何镇压和欺骗所能动摇和改变的。
    今天，即便是美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”也不得不承认，“安全条约和美国驻日军事基地的今后的前景将取决于日本国民的意志。”由于日本国内反美情绪的空前高涨和日本人民斗争意志的无比坚强，美国舆论界已普遍担心，将来保持新“安全条约”和美国军事基地“实质上可能是困难的”。合众国际社的记者汉斯莱公开提出，在目前的情况下，新“安全条约”究竟有多大价值。的确，只要日本人民坚决不批准日美军事同盟条约，坚持斗争，拒绝执行这个条约，那么，用人民的力量来最后废除这个条约是完全可能的。
    日本人民的斗争，已经推翻了艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的计划，并迫使岸信介卖国贼可耻地宣布下台。一个胜利接着一个胜利，必将进一步鼓舞日本人民，为彻底废除日美军事同盟条约而斗争到底。
