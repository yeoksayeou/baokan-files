Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 12th: Cadres at all levels in Guizhou Province are going deep into the forefront of production to participate in and lead production, pushing the current rush planting and harvesting campaign to a new high.

In the past two months, the vast majority of responsible cadres of the Provincial Party Committee have been inspecting and leading production in the People's Communes, and six secretaries, alternate secretaries, or standing committee members have been stationed in various regions (prefectures) and municipal Party committees to assist in the work. Local (prefecture), city, and county Party committees have all adopted measures of layered contracting and large-scale delegation of cadres, shrinking leading organs, enriching the grassroots. Many county-level organs have drawn cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership by establishing joint offices for agriculture and forestry, industry and transportation, finance and trade, political and legal affairs, mass organizations, and cultural, educational, and health affairs. In twenty counties in the three regions of Bijie, Tongren, and Qiannan, the number of cadres sent to the grassroots in May reached 15,400, an increase of 45% compared with April, with an even higher proportion of leading cadres. Sixteen of the nineteen members of the Changshun County Party Committee went to the grassroots to take on leadership roles. Some counties stipulate that each cadre must spend at least seven months of the year participating in and leading production. Due to the large number of cadres being delegated, the Party's leadership over grassroots work has been greatly strengthened, and a new atmosphere has generally emerged in various places, with cadres going deeper into reality, participating in more labor, conducting more investigations and research, solving problems faster, and closer relations between cadres and the masses.

With the formation of a prevailing atmosphere of going deep into the grassroots, many areas have implemented office relocation, with county Party committee offices moving to communes, communes moving to management districts, and management districts moving to production teams. In order to strive for high yields and bumper harvests, the Tongren Prefectural Party Committee office moved directly to the high-yield dam to work, and all 27,800 high-yield dams, bumper harvest slopes, and high-yield ditches in the area are contracted and responsible by Party committees at all levels, from start to finish, until the autumn harvest. The Zheng'an County Party Committee even moved the Standing Committee meeting to the production team and invited some production team and small team cadres to attend. The grassroots cadres provided a wealth of materials at the meeting, which enriched the content of the meeting and solved many problems.

The "Two-Five System" leadership method has been widely promoted in various regions of Guizhou Province, which has played a significant role in improving leadership style and working methods. The "Two-Five System" means that in a week, cadres spend the first two days holding meetings, studying work, and learning, and the last five days going deep into the production team to work and participate in production. According to incomplete statistics from five special (prefecture) areas such as Qiandongnan and Zunyi, this working method has now been fully promoted in county-level organs, and 95% of commune-level cadres have implemented this method. In the past, a considerable number of cadres below the county level did not do a good job in production, and cadres who went to the countryside squeezed out study time. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System," the time for cadres to work, study, and labor has been guaranteed, and it has become a system for cadres to bring tools and books when they go to the countryside. Among the grassroots cadres in various places, a considerable number are newly promoted poor and lower-middle peasants, and the implementation of the "Two-Five System" has played a good role in helping them improve their working ability and cultural level. In addition, since cadres at all levels spend most of their time participating in production and work at the grassroots level, everyone has mastered a large amount of information, which has also greatly reduced the number of meetings, documents, and reports, and the quality has continued to improve. According to a survey of some areas in five special (prefecture) areas such as Qiandongnan, Bijie, and Zunyi, the number of various meetings, documents, and reports in May was reduced by about half compared with April. While promoting the "Two-Five System," many areas have also formulated and implemented "Three-Two-Five System" (three days for studying and researching work, two days for patrol inspection, and five days for production) and other new leadership methods according to local characteristics.

Leading cadres at all levels go deep into the grassroots, first as students, learning from the masses with an open mind; then as teachers, guiding the masses in production. The county committee members of Sinan County all worshiped commune members as teachers and learned production experience. In order to better guide the production of small teams, the first secretary of the Chishui County Party Committee went to the Banzhu small team of Chengguan Commune to learn the experience of being a small team leader. He first humbly learned the leadership methods of the small team leader, and then learned about the problems existing in the work, and helped the small team to reasonably arrange labor force, overcoming the phenomenon of improper use of labor.

All cadres working in the countryside eat, live, work, and study with the masses, thereby further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. They carry farm tools with them, and wherever they go, they work there. The nine Party committee members of Chengguan Commune in Yanhe County carried rice transplanters on their backs when they went to the countryside, teaching techniques while transplanting rice seedlings, and have now taught more than 500 people to use rice transplanters. Xie Zhaorui, secretary of the production team branch of Liudu Commune in Zheng'an County, took the lead in plowing muddy fields. Under his influence, the thirty mu of muddy fields that no one wanted to plow in the past were all plowed in one day. Cadres in various places regard helping to run the canteens well as an important task. Some personally go to the canteens as cooks, and some try their best to help the canteens do a good job in household production. Tang Jibin, secretary of the Party branch of Lianhua Management District of Longshan Commune in Guiding County, moved to the old Zhai canteen with a poor foundation and helped the canteen to vigorously develop household production. In less than a month, he transformed the canteen and made it a model canteen for the whole commune.

    切切实实地大抓措施　促进生产高潮一浪高过一浪
    贵州各级干部坚决深入基层
    广泛推行“二五制”，领导干部每周要有五天到生产队深入工作
    据新华社贵阳12日电　贵州省各级干部深入生产第一线去参加生产领导生产，把当前农村的抢种抢收运动推向了新的高潮。
    最近两个月来，省委绝大多数负责干部一直在人民公社检查、领导生产，并有六位书记、候补书记或常委常住各地（州）、市委协助工作。各地（州）、市、县委都采取层层包干、大量下放干部的措施，紧缩领导机关，充实基层，许多县级机关通过建立农林、工交、财贸、政法党群和文教卫生联合办公室的办法，抽出干部加强基层领导。毕节、铜仁、黔南三个地区二十个县，5月份下放到基层的干部达一万五千四百多人，较4月份增加45％，其中领导干部增加的比例更高。中共长顺县委的十九个委员，有十六个到基层担任领导工作。有的县规定每个干部每年至少以七个月的时间参加生产领导生产。由于大批干部下放，党对基层工作的领导大大加强，各地普遍出现了干部深入实际多、参加劳动多、调查研究多和解决问题快、干群关系更加密切的新气象。
    在深入基层形成风气的情况下，不少地区实行办公室搬家，县委办公室搬到公社，公社搬到管理区，管理区搬到生产队。为了争取高产丰收，中共铜仁地委办公室直接搬到丰产坝办公，全区二万七千八百个丰产坝、丰收坡、丰产沟，分别由各级党委包干负责，一管到底，直到秋收。正安县委还将常委会移到生产队去开，并吸收部分生产队和小队干部列席。基层干部在会上提供了丰富的材料，使会议的内容更加充实，讨论解决了许多问题。
    贵州省各地区普遍推行“二五制”的领导方法，对于改进领导作风与工作方法起了显著作用。“二五制”就是在一个星期当中，前两天干部开会、研究工作和学习，后五天到生产小队深入工作、参加生产。据黔东南、遵义等五个专（州）的不完全统计，目前县一级机关已经全部推广这一工作方法，公社一级干部中有95％实行了这一方法。过去，县以下机关相当多的机关干部搞不好生产，下乡工作的干部挤掉了学习。推行了“二五制”后，干部工作、学习、劳动的时间都有了保证，干部下乡带工具、带书籍已经形成制度。各地基层干部中，有相当一部分是新提拔的贫农和下中农，实行“二五制”后，对于帮助他们提高工作能力和文化水平起了良好的作用。此外，由于各级干部大部分时间在基层参加生产和工作，每个人都掌握了大量的材料，还使会议、文件、表报的数量大为减少，质量不断提高。据黔东南、毕节、遵义等五个专（州）部分地区的调查，5月份各种会议、文件和表报，比4月份减少一半左右。在推行“二五制”的同时，不少地区还根据本地的特点订出了实行“三二五制”（每十天中，三天学习和研究工作，两天巡回检查，五天生产）和其他新的领导方法。
    各级领导干部深入基层，都是先当学生，向群众虚心学习；后当先生，指导群众生产。思南县的县委委员人人拜社员为师，学习生产经验。为了更好地指导小队生产，中共赤水县委第一书记到城关公社班竹小队学习当小队长的经验。他首先虚心学习小队长的领导方法，然后了解工作中存在的问题，帮助小队合理安排劳动力，克服了劳力使用不当的现象。
    所有下乡工作的干部，都与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，从而进一步密切了干部和群众的关系。他们随身携带农具，走到哪里，就在哪里劳动。沿河县城关公社九个党委委员，下乡都背上插秧机，边插秧边传授技术，现在已教会五百多人使用插秧机插秧。正安县流渡公社生产队支部书记谢昭瑞带头犁滥田，在他的影响下，过去谁都不愿犁的三十亩滥田，一天就全部犁完。各地干部都把帮助办好食堂作为一项重要任务，有的亲自到食堂当炊事员，有的千方百计帮助食堂搞好家底生产。贵定县龙山公社莲花管理区党支部书记唐继斌，搬到基础差的老寨食堂住下，帮助食堂大搞家底生产，不到一个月的时间就使这个食堂改变了面貌，成为全社的标兵食堂。
