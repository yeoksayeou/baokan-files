    Ten years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong said at the eighth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee: "The Chinese people have long declared that the affairs of all countries in the world should be managed by the people of each country themselves, and the affairs of Asia should be managed by the people of Asia themselves, and should not be managed by the United States. American aggression against Asia can only arouse widespread and resolute resistance from the Asian people." As you sow, so shall you reap. The seeds of hatred that American imperialism has sown in Asia for the past ten years have reached the point where it is reaping the bitter fruit. The storm of Asian people firmly opposing American imperialism is rising day by day.
    Ten years ago, American imperialism launched the Korean War and, at the same time, occupied China's territory of Taiwan. This was the largest-scale act of aggression launched by American imperialism since the end of World War II. On the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors mobilized one-third of their army, one-fifth of their air force, and most of their navy, consuming more than 73 million tons of war materials and spending more than 20 billion U.S. dollars in war expenses. American imperialism also coerced fifteen countries to send troops to participate in its criminal war. In the Korean War, the American aggressors used all modern weapons except atomic weapons, and even carried out inhuman germ warfare. The war plan of American imperialism was not only to eliminate the eastern barrier of the socialist camp—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—but also to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China, attempting to strangle the newly established People's Republic of China in one fell swoop. This was the first step in American imperialism's strategic plan to dominate Asia. As early as ten years ago, American imperialism exposed itself as the most ferocious aggressor and the common enemy of Asian peace and world peace.
    At that time, the Korean and Chinese people faced a very serious choice. American imperialism, relying on its military superiority, imposed the war on the heads of the Korean and Chinese people. Should the Korean and Chinese people succumb to the pressure of imperialism and beg it for peace, or should they stand up, take up arms, and resolutely smash the American imperialism's plan of aggressive war? The heroic Korean and Chinese people resolutely chose the latter, defending their independence with a just war, and defending Asian and world peace.
    Lenin once said: "If you hit the enemy hard, he will come to negotiate." This truth has been proved once again in the Korean War. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Korean and Chinese people repeatedly proposed to end the Korean War through peaceful negotiations, but American imperialism dreamed of conquering North Korea and then invading New China, and refused to withdraw its claws. Only after thirty-seven months of fighting did the heroic Korean and Chinese people puncture the appearance of the American paper tiger, and drive the American aggressors from the banks of the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, forcing it to sign the armistice agreement. Only then was the Korean armistice realized, and a great fire started by the United States in Asia was extinguished. Therefore, the just war of the Korean and Chinese people against the American aggressors is not only a struggle to defend their motherland, but also a struggle to defend Asian and world peace. The victory of this great struggle powerfully demonstrates that for American imperialism's acts of aggression and war, one must respond in kind, tit for tat, and wage a struggle against it, until a just war is used to oppose the unjust war it launches, in order to effectively safeguard national independence and defend world peace. Only by bloodying American imperialism can its plans of aggression and war be thwarted.
    After the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism did not lay down its butcher knife. After the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides faithfully fulfilled the armistice agreement. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and peacefully unify North and South Korea. In order to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to completely withdraw from Korea. All of these demonstrated the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese sides in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, American imperialism, which is addicted to aggression, not only rejected all proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and refused to completely withdraw its troops from Korea, but also constantly violated the armistice agreement and even transported atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea. At the same time, the American aggressors continued to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, and frequently carried out military provocations and war threats against China in the Taiwan Strait area. American imperialism also made every effort to revive Japanese militarist forces as an accomplice in its pursuit of aggressive and war policies in Asia. It cobbled together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, established military bases everywhere, trampled on the sovereignty of many countries, and plotted new wars of aggression. It supported the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime in South Vietnam to expand its army and prepare for war, incited civil war in Laos, and carried out subversive activities in Cambodia, undermining the Indochina armistice agreement. These acts of aggression and war by American imperialism are the root cause of the tense situation in Asia and a serious threat to peace in Asia.
    In the past ten years, American imperialism has committed all kinds of evils in Asia, and its ferocity has surpassed that of all imperialists who carried out colonial expansion in Asia in the past. No Asian country has sent a single soldier to the United States, nor has it occupied an inch of American territory; but American imperialism has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in Asian countries, turning the territories of many countries into its military bases, and supporting a group of the most corrupt, most reactionary, and most barbaric puppet regimes, carrying out the most brutal aggression and oppression against the people of Asian countries. American imperialism has become a "plague god" that has brought disaster, poverty, and suffering to the people of Asian countries. However, the extreme ferocity of American imperialism cannot but lead to its opposite. It has made the people of Asian countries increasingly understand that in order to win and maintain national independence, in order to maintain peace and tranquility in Asia, and in order to survive, they can only rise up and fight against American imperialism and its running dogs. Precisely because of this, this year, the people of Asia have launched a surging storm against American imperialism, and American imperialism has placed itself in a predicament where it is besieged on all sides.
    American imperialism is a very violent enemy. It has a large amount of steel, huge military equipment, and also atomic weapons. It is indeed not easy to dare to stand up and fight it. But what has happened in Asia in the past ten years has repeatedly proved that American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and it can be completely defeated. The Korean and Chinese people defeated the American aggressors, forcing them to accept the armistice, which proved this point. The Indochinese people, with their resolute struggle, prevented American imperialism from directly participating in the Indochina War, and shattered its conspiracy to continue and expand this war, which also proved this point. Recently, the American faithful lackey Syngman Rhee was overthrown by the wave of patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, and another American faithful lackey Menderes was overthrown by the wave of patriotic struggle of the Turkish people. Eisenhower wanted to go to Japan but was rejected by the Japanese people, and Nobusuke Kishi finally had to step down. All of this shows that American imperialism and its running dogs are far from being as powerful as they appear to be. The powerful and invincible force is the people who have awakened and united to fight. This cannot but greatly enhance the confidence and determination of the people of Asian countries to oppose American imperialism and its running dogs. The history of Asia is developing in a new direction: it is not the oppressed people of Asia who are afraid of American imperialism and its running dogs, but American imperialism and its running dogs who are afraid of the Asian people who have awakened and risen up to fight.
    The storm of struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs that is currently rising in Asia is shaking the American system of aggressive war in Asia. The United States has been engaging in aggression in Asia for ten years and is now reaping its own bitter fruit. No matter how much money the United States spends, how many troops it sends, or what kind of puppets it supports, it cannot stop the awakening and resistance of the Asian people. Eisenhower's recent trip to the Far East is the most vivid illustration that American imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia has suffered a shameful defeat. Although the American and Japanese reactionaries barely brought the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty into effect, the Japanese people are determined to continue the struggle to smash this military alliance to the end. Although the wave of struggle of the South Korean and Turkish people seems to have slowed down slightly at present, it is only a trough before a higher wave arrives. Although the surface seems to be relatively calm in some parts of Asia, the anger of the people there is actually burning, and the volcano there is brewing to erupt. Although the struggle is long-term and arduous, and the road is rugged and tortuous, the day in Asian history will eventually come when the entire system of aggressive war of American imperialism in Asia will completely collapse in the flames of the increasingly vigorous struggle of the Asian people.
    Of course, American imperialism has not retreated in the face of difficulties. Syngman Rhee was overthrown by the South Korean people, and the United States still wants to replace the old puppet with a new puppet, Huh Chung. Nobusuke Kishi was forced to step down, and the United States still wants to support a Nobusuke Kishi the Second. Eisenhower suffered a head-on blow from the Asian people, and Nixon and Dillon successively clamored to "recover lost ground," and American military leaders hurriedly held meetings to study the U.S. war preparations plan in the Far East. But in any case, Washington is filled with an undisguised sense of pessimism and disappointment, which is completely different from the arrogance and recklessness of American imperialism ten years ago.
    Asia is in the midst of great change. Ten years ago, the Korean and Chinese people bravely waged a tit-for-tat struggle against American imperialism. Today, more people in Asian countries have awakened to oppose American imperialism. Ten years ago, American imperialism was still dreaming of the "good dream" of Asians fighting Asians. Today, American imperialism is in the midst of a siege by the Asian people. The people of Asian countries, supporting each other in the struggle, are forming a united front against American imperialism. If American imperialism could barely implement its plans of aggression and war in some places in the past ten years, then the next ten years will be ten years in which American imperialism will suffer setbacks everywhere in Asia. The Chinese people will eventually recover their territory of Taiwan; the Japanese people will sooner or later get rid of American control and appear in Asia as a truly independent, democratic, and peaceful nation; the Korean and Vietnamese people will eventually realize the reunification of their motherland; and the people of Turkey, the Philippines, and other countries will also smash the shackles of American imperialism and achieve true independence. Asia is the Asia of the Asian people. The Asian people unite and drive American imperialism out of Asia!

### 把美帝国主义赶出亚洲去！

    把美帝国主义赶出亚洲去！
    十年以前，毛泽东主席曾在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上说：“中国人民早已声明，全世界各国的事务应由各国人民自己来管，亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管，而不应由美国来管。美国对亚洲的侵略，只能引起亚洲人民广泛的和坚决的反抗。”种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。十年来美帝国主义在亚洲散播的仇恨种子，已经到了它自食其果的日子。亚洲人民坚决反对美帝国主义的风暴正在日益兴起。
    十年前，美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，同时侵占了中国的领土台湾。这是第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义发动的一次规模最大的侵略行动。在朝鲜战场上，美国侵略者动员了它的三分之一陆军、五分之一空军和大部分海军，消耗了七千三百万吨以上的作战物资，花费了两百亿美元以上的战费。美帝国主义还胁迫十五个国家派出军队参加它的罪恶战争。在侵朝战争中，美国侵略者使用了除了原子武器以外的一切现代武器，甚至进行了绝灭人性的细菌战。美帝国主义的战争计划，不仅要消灭社会主义阵营东方的屏障——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且遵循着日本帝国主义侵略中国的老路，妄想一举扼杀成立不久的中华人民共和国。这是美帝国主义称霸亚洲的战略计划的第一步。早在十年以前，美帝国主义就暴露了它是最凶恶的侵略者，是亚洲和平和世界和平的公敌。
    当时，朝鲜人民和中国人民面临着十分严重的抉择。美帝国主义恃其军事上的优势，把战争强加到朝中人民的头上来。朝中人民是屈服于帝国主义的压力之下，向它乞求和平呢，还是挺起胸膛，拿起武器，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的侵略战争计划呢？英勇的朝鲜人民和中国人民毅然选择了后者，以正义的战争保卫自己的独立，保卫亚洲和世界和平。
    列宁曾经说过：“你打痛了敌人，他就会来讲和的。”这个真理在朝鲜战争中又一次得到了证明。在美国发动侵朝战争以后，朝中人民曾经一而再、再而三地提出经过和平谈判结束朝鲜战争的主张，但是美帝国主义却做着征服朝鲜北部并进而侵犯新中国的迷梦，不肯缩回它的魔爪。只是经过了三十七个月的较量之后，英勇的朝中人民戳破了美国纸老虎的原形，把美国侵略者从鸭绿江畔打退到三八线附近，才迫使它不得不在停战协定上签了字。这才实现了朝鲜停战，扑灭了美国在亚洲放起的一场大火。因此，朝中人民反对美国侵略者的正义战争，不仅是一场保卫祖国的斗争，也是一场保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。这场伟大的斗争的胜利，有力地表明：对于美帝国主义的侵略活动和战争活动，必须以眼还眼，以牙还牙，进行针锋相对的斗争，直到以正义的战争来反对它所发动的非正义战争，才能有效地维护民族的独立，才能保卫世界和平。只有把美帝国主义打得头破血流，才能挫败它的侵略计划和战争计划。
    在侵朝战争失败之后，美帝国主义并没有放下屠刀。朝鲜停战以后，朝中方面忠实地履行了停战协定。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一再提出所有外国军队撤出朝鲜、和平统一南北朝鲜的建议。中国人民志愿军为了促使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，首先主动地完全撤离了朝鲜。这些都表明了朝中方面真诚谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。可是，侵略成性的美帝国主义，不仅拒绝一切和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，不肯从朝鲜完全撤出它的军队，并且不断破坏停战协定，甚至把原子武器和导弹武器运进南朝鲜。同时，美国侵略者继续霸占中国领土台湾，并且经常在台湾海峡地区对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。美帝国主义还全力复活日本军国主义势力，作为它在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策的帮凶。它拼凑了东南亚条约组织，到处建立军事基地，蹂躏许多国家的主权，策划新的侵略战争。它在南越支持吴庭艳傀儡政权扩军备战，在老挝挑起内战，在柬埔寨进行颠复活动，破坏印度支那停战协定。美帝国主义的这些侵略活动和战争活动，是亚洲紧张局势的根源，是亚洲和平的严重威胁。
    在过去十年中，美帝国主义在亚洲为非作歹，其凶恶的程度超过了过去在亚洲进行殖民扩张的一切帝国主义者。任何一个亚洲国家都没有派一兵一卒到美国去，也没有霸占美国一寸土地；而美帝国主义却在亚洲各国驻有几十万之多的军队，把许多国家的领土变成为它的军事基地，并且扶植了一批最腐败、最反动、最野蛮的傀儡政权，对亚洲各国人民进行了最残暴的侵略和压迫。美帝国主义成了亚洲各国人民遭受灾难、贫困和痛苦的“瘟神”。但是美帝国主义的穷凶极恶不能不走向它的反面。它使得亚洲国家的人民越来越多地懂得：要争取和维护民族独立，要维护亚洲的和平和安宁，要活命，就只有起来进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。正是因为这样的原故，今年以来，亚洲人民兴起了汹涌澎湃的反对美帝国主义的风暴，美帝国主义已使它自己处于四面受敌的困境。
    美帝国主义是一个十分强暴的敌人。它有大量的钢铁，有庞大的军事装备，还有原子武器。敢于起来同它作斗争，的确不是容易的。但是过去十年在亚洲发生的事情一再证明：美帝国主义不过是一个外强中干的纸老虎，是完全可以战胜的。朝中人民击败了美国侵略者，迫使它接受停战，证明了这一点。印度支那人民以坚决的斗争使得美帝国主义不敢直接参加印度支那战争，粉碎了它继续进行和扩大这个战争的阴谋，也证明了这一点。最近美国的忠实奴才李承晚被南朝鲜人民爱国斗争的浪潮所冲倒，美国的另一个忠实奴才曼德列斯被土耳其人民的爱国斗争的浪潮所冲倒，艾森豪威尔想去日本而被日本人民拒于门外，岸信介也终于不得不下台，都表明了美帝国主义及其走狗远不是像它们的外表那末强大。拥有强大力量的、不可战胜的，是觉醒和团结起来进行斗争的人民。这就不能不大大增强亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的信心和决心。亚洲的历史正朝着一个新的方向发展：不是亚洲被压迫的人民害怕美帝国主义及其走狗，而是美帝国主义及其走狗害怕已经觉悟并起来斗争的亚洲人民。
    目前正在亚洲兴起的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴，震撼着美国在亚洲的侵略战争体系。美国在亚洲搞了十年侵略，正在自食其恶果。不管美国花了多少钱，派有多少军队，扶植什么样的傀儡，都无法阻止亚洲人民的觉醒和反抗。艾森豪威尔最近的远东之行，就最生动不过地表明：美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略和战争政策已经遭到了可耻的失败。尽管美日反动派勉强使美日军事同盟条约生效，但是日本人民却坚决要把粉碎这个军事同盟的斗争继续进行到底。尽管南朝鲜和土耳其人民的斗争浪潮目前似乎略为和缓，但是它不过是一个更高的浪头到来之前的波谷。尽管在亚洲某些地方表面上似乎还较平静，但是实际上那里的人民的怒火在燃烧着，那里的火山正在酝酿着爆发。尽管斗争是长期的、艰苦的，道路是崎岖的、曲折的，但是亚洲历史上的那一天终将到来，那时，美帝国主义在亚洲的整个侵略战争体系将在亚洲人民日益旺盛的斗争的烈火中全面崩溃。
    当然，美帝国主义并没有知难而退。李承晚被南朝鲜人民推倒了，美国还想用新的傀儡许政来代替旧的傀儡。岸信介被迫下台了，美国还想扶植一个岸信介第二。艾森豪威尔遭到了亚洲人民的迎头痛击，尼克松和狄龙相继叫嚷要“收复失去的阵地”，美国的军事头目慌忙开会研究美国在远东的备战计划。但是不管怎么样，华盛顿弥漫着无法掩饰的悲观失望的情绪，这同十年前美帝国主义那种嚣张狂妄的情况相比，真是不可同日而语了。
    亚洲正处于伟大的变化中。十年以前，朝中人民英勇地同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，今天，在亚洲已经有更多国家的人民觉醒起来，反对美帝国主义。十年前，美帝国主义还在做着亚洲人打亚洲人的“好梦”，如今，美帝国主义却正处于亚洲人民四面围攻之中。在斗争中互相支持的亚洲各国人民，正在形成反对美帝国主义的统一战线。如果说过去的十年中美帝国主义还能在一些地方勉强推行它的侵略计划和战争计划的话，那末，未来的十年将是美帝国主义在亚洲到处碰得头破血流的十年。中国人民终将收复自己的领土台湾；日本人民迟早会摆脱美国的控制，以一个真正独立、民主、和平的民族出现于亚洲；朝鲜和越南人民终将实现祖国的统一；土耳其、菲律宾等国的人民，也必将粉碎美帝国主义的奴役枷锁，取得真正的独立。亚洲是亚洲人民的亚洲。亚洲人民团结起来，把美帝国主义赶出亚洲去！
