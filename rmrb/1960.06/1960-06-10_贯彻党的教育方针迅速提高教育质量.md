Implement the Party's Education Policy and Rapidly Improve the Quality of Education
Representative of Kunming No. 23 Middle School, Yunnan Province　Ma Wen
    Our Kunming No. 23 Middle School is a mountain school established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It has 189 students from Han, Bai, Yi, Miao, and other ethnic groups, with minority students accounting for more than 80%. Over the past year or so, under the radiant guidance of the General Line and the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, all teachers and students in the school have conscientiously and comprehensively implemented the Party's education policy, and rapidly improved the quality of education. In the two unified examinations in the city last July and February, the results ranked among the best in the city, and we won the glorious title of Red Flag Unit.
    Poverty Spurs Change, Labor Builds the School
    When the school was first established, the masses said that Kunming No. 23 Middle School had four deficiencies: the school was newly established with a poor foundation, the teaching equipment was poor, the teachers' level was poor, and the students' foundation was poor. The school had no school buildings, let alone teaching books and instruments. Teachers and students attended classes in dilapidated temples during the day and stayed overnight in farmers' homes at night. At that time, the school had only one vice principal (a Party member) and five teachers. Except for one teacher who graduated from university, the rest were of secondary education level and had relatively short teaching experience. The students came from mountainous areas and generally had a poor foundation. Some could not even write a short article of fifty or sixty characters, and there were many typos; some could not even calculate four mixed operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Moreover, there were many ethnic minority students, and their language habits were different from those of the Han, which further increased the difficulty of teaching. Only one-third of the students had arrived a few days after the start of the school. Under these circumstances, some teachers and students wavered and wanted to leave the school. In response to the above situation, our school's Party organization first conducted education on the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle for teachers and students, explained the great significance of the Party running middle schools in mountainous ethnic minority areas, and mobilized all teachers to go deep into the masses to publicize the Party's education policy and the Party's care for the people in mountainous areas from house to house. After the masses understood the Party's policies, they actively supported the school and happily sent their children to school. The number of students quickly increased from more than forty to one hundred and thirty. Subsequently, the school organized all teachers and students to study the Party's General Line, which greatly improved the socialist consciousness of teachers and students. Teachers and students jointly realized that the key to whether the school can be run well does not lie in the quality of the conditions, but in whether there is lofty ambition and revolutionary vigor, and whether there is the idea of relying on the Party organization and the masses to run the school; moreover, the school still has many favorable conditions, such as most students being the children of poor peasants who have suffered from the pain of being uneducated for generations and are eager to improve their culture. After study and discussion, teachers and students established confidence and unanimously expressed that they would build their own school with their own hands under the leadership of the Party.
    Our school, adhering to the principle of running the school diligently and frugally and not asking the state for money, mobilized all teachers and students to devote themselves to the tense labor of building the school, leveling hillsides, cutting thorns, and making adobe for foundations when there were no bricks, and collecting tiles from various village kilns when there were no tiles. With the strong support of Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of the people, after half a year of efforts, the new school buildings were finally completed. The commune allocated good land in front of the village to the school as a base for productive labor and supported the school with wood and bricks for building pig and sheep pens. Teachers and students raised pigs and grew vegetables, and the food improved accordingly, and life became stable. In order to enrich the students' lives, we vigorously carried out cultural and sports activities. Teachers and students opened up a basketball court and a volleyball court each, and also made ball racks with old wood, installed single and parallel bars, and opened a sixty-meter track. In this way, the school's appearance was quickly changed, creating favorable conditions for the development of teaching work.
    Greatly Break "Theory of Conditions Only," Vigorously Grasp Basic Courses
    In early 1959, the Municipal Party Committee issued instructions to the city's education front to "meticulously carve and improve the quality of teaching," which gave great inspiration and encouragement to all teachers and students in our school. We were determined to respond to the Party's call, rapidly improve the quality of teaching, and catch up with advanced schools. But at this time, some teachers lacked confidence, emphasized difficulties, and blamed the students for having a poor foundation. They said: "How can mountain schools catch up with urban areas? How can new schools catch up with old schools?" They regarded improving the quality of teaching as unattainable, and believed that even if it could be improved, it would have to be done slowly, but most teachers believed that things depended on human effort, and people could change conditions. The school's Party organization resolutely relied on the majority. After a fierce debate, the "theory of conditions" could not stand, and all teachers and students were closely united around the Party organization, with one heart and one mind, and launched a vigorous mass movement to teach well and learn well, combining soaring revolutionary vigor with down-to-earth work, and adopted a series of measures to vigorously grasp basic courses. For example, the language teachers, based on the situation that the ethnic minority students in the mountainous areas had a poor foundation of knowledge and different languages, started with punctuation marks, a single word, a single phrase, and a single sentence, and gradually reached the curriculum progress standard from the shallow to the deep. The teachers analyzed the situation of each class and each student, constantly conducted queuing, and went deep into the students to prepare lessons. We found that: because the grammatical arrangement of ethnic minorities is different from that of Chinese, some ethnic minority students always reversed the order of words. The teachers carefully collected and sorted out the comparison table of Chinese word order and ethnic word order in the text to help students master it. There were many typos by the students, and the teachers of each subject assisted the language teachers to collect the students' typos, sort out the comparison table of correct and wrong characters, and distributed them to the students, which greatly reduced the number of typos. The teachers also stipulated that the students write small regular script every day, write weekly diaries every week, and adopt methods such as memorization and dictation to make the students read more, write more, and use more, and consolidate what they have learned. For example, when writing small regular script, they not only practiced characters, but also copied texts, phrases, and sentences, and learned to apply punctuation marks. These measures have achieved good results. Now the students write more justly, can write more fluent short articles, and can write the new words they have learned and the good people and deeds around them into their compositions. The math teachers strengthened the teaching and review and consolidation of basic concepts, and compiled many example problems based on the calculation problems encountered daily to help students actually calculate and apply them. Students originally did not know how to read maps, and the geography teachers cut the map and let the students put it back together so that the students remembered the directions, locations, and terrain more firmly.
    Teaching and Learning Grow Together, Conduct Mass Movements
    Before and after class, teachers always listen to students' opinions and improve teaching. During breaks, you can often see a group of students talking with teachers, and we call this talk "teaching visiting meetings." In addition to raising opinions on teachers' lectures at the meeting, students can also write big-character posters. When the biology teacher heard that the students could not understand his class, he thought of ways to prepare the lesson well, learn from the students, and learn from the old farmers, and strive to combine teaching with production practice. Teachers also appropriately supplemented the teaching materials according to the Party's central work and the international and domestic situation in various periods to enhance the political and ideological nature of the teaching materials. In order to enable the students to learn better, the teachers conscientiously prepared lessons collectively, carried out demonstration teaching, followed the class to give tutoring during self-study, and stipulated special tutoring time for students with poor grades, and organized students with good grades to help each other. The school also organized teachers to learn from others everywhere, visited Kunming No. 8 Middle School, No. 9 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 17 Middle School, etc., to learn advanced experience. And it was linked with No. 8 Middle School to send teachers to learn from each other, and we quickly promoted the good experience learned from brother schools in the school. In terms of improving students' learning consciousness and enthusiasm, in addition to organizing students to visit factories and farms in the city, we also invited the commune Party committee to the school to make reports, talking about the development prospects of the mountainous areas and the needs for talents, inspiring students to clarify the purpose of learning and establish the ambition to climb the peak of cultural science. Since 1958, we have always insisted on conducting mass movements. According to the problems to be solved in each period, we have set up pace-setters and mobilized all students to learn from the pace-setters. Recently, in carrying out the "Be a Good Communist Student" movement, more than sixty pace-setters were selected through evaluation. And organized the students to discuss: "What should we learn from the pace-setters? Why can't I do what others can do?" Many students wrote letters of determination and set out plans to catch up with the pace-setters. Driven by the movement, the students' learning enthusiasm has generally increased, and their academic performance has continued to rise, and the number of excellent students has greatly increased.
Education combined with productive labor
    Comprehensively improve the quality of education
    Under the ideological guidance of centering on teaching and comprehensively implementing the education policy, our No. 23 Middle School has also solved the problem of combining education with productive labor relatively well. In addition to actively investing in the labor of building the school in the early stage of the school, all teachers and students have also vigorously supported the central work and actively participated in social activities during the busy farming season. In 1959 alone, we helped the commune plant 58 mu of seedlings, harvest 245 mu of wheat, corn, beans, etc., accumulate 300,000 catties of fertilizer, and repair 3 kilometers of roads. We also took the initiative to help the district committee, commune, and management area run cadre spare-time cultural classes and primary school teacher spare-time refresher schools. Recently, we have also assisted the management area in training nursery and kindergarten nurses, educators, and health workers. The school's labor base has also taken shape. At present, all teachers and students in the school have planted 98 mu of vegetable land (about 5 points per person), raised more than 30 pigs, more than 60 sheep, 150 chickens, and also ran a factory. The whole school has accumulated production funds of 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Without teaching equipment, teachers and students made more than 100 kinds of their own. Through labor, the quality of teaching has rapidly improved. In the past, students' compositions were dry, but after participating in productive labor, they had feelings, and the content of their compositions became much richer. Mathematics, physics, and other courses also compiled exercises combined with productive labor, and students felt very interested. Students did not have a clear concept of squares and cubes, but they had a deeper understanding through calculating earthworks when digging soil. In the arrangement of teaching and labor time, the "small one, one five" system is implemented, that is, five days of class, one day of labor, and one day of rest. The time every night is basically reserved for teachers to prepare lessons, grade homework, and give after-school tutoring. Students have one and a half hours of extracurricular activities every afternoon and eight hours of sleep at night. The school's cultural and sports activities are also very active. In this way, labor is guaranteed, lessons are learned well, and the physical and mental health of teachers and students is guaranteed.
    Respect teachers and love students, establish a new type of teacher-student relationship
    The school cares for the students in every possible way. In addition to grasping education in political and other aspects, it also takes care of them in life. Some students do not have money to buy books and utensils, and the school uses labor income to buy them for them; if they do not have soap to wash clothes, they will distribute the soap made by the school's soap factory for them to use; when it is cold, some students with financial difficulties do not have winter clothes, and the school will give them subsidies. Student Zhu Zengliang from Class 3 comes from a poor peasant family. He is an orphan and a family member of a revolutionary martyr. The commune and the school have given him a lot of help, but he still has difficulties in life. He has no cotton clothes to wear in winter. When the teacher learned of this situation, he gave his cotton clothes, sneakers, and hat to him. Student Zhu Zengliang was so moved that he shed tears. For another example, when student Li Yongchang was sick, the principal went to see him and found that his heels were cracked and bleeding, so he brought a basin of hot water, took a pair of shoes, and personally washed his feet and applied medicine to him. The students were deeply moved and studied harder, determined to study well to repay the Party's care. The students also love the school and respect the teachers very much. When they return to school on Sundays, they always bring a load of firewood to the school's mess hall, and when it rains, they always bring some fresh mushrooms for the teachers to eat. A brand-new relationship has been formed between teachers and students. In the past year or so, except for one student who was transferred away by the commune, no students have moved or left the school.
    At present, our school is further implementing the Party's education policy on the basis of the achievements it has made, and deeply carrying out the education revolution, thoroughly carrying out teaching reform, and striving to improve the quality of education.

    贯彻党的教育方针迅速提高教育质量
    云南省昆明市第二十三中学代表　马文
    我们昆明第二十三中学是1958年大跃进中成立的一所山区学校，有汉、白、彝、苗等族学生一百八十九人，其中少数民族学生占80％以上。一年多来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在市委的直接领导下，全校师生认真而全面地贯彻了党的教育方针，迅速地提高了教育质量，去年7月和今年2月全市两次统考中，成绩都名列全市前茅，获得了红旗单位的光荣称号。
    穷则思变  劳动建校
    学校刚成立时，群众说昆明二十三中有四差：学校新办基础差，教学设备差，教师水平差，学生底子差。学校既无校舍，更无教学图书和仪器，师生白天在破庙上课，晚上在农民家借宿。当时学校只有一个副校长（党员），五个教师，除一个教师是大学毕业的以外，其余的都是中等教育程度，教龄也比较短。学生来自山区，基础一般比较差，有的连五、六十字的短文也写不通，错别字很多，加减乘除连起来的四则题也不会算；民族学生又多，语言习惯和汉族不同，更增加了教学上的困难。开学几天了，学生才来了三分之一。在这样的情况下，个别教师和学生动摇了，想离开学校。针对以上情况，我校党组织首先对师生进行了艰苦奋斗的革命传统教育，说明党在山区兄弟民族地区办中学的重大意义，并发动全体教师深入群众，家家户户地宣传党的教育方针和党对山区人民的关怀。群众懂得了党的政策以后，积极支持学校，愉快地把自己的子女送来入学，学生人数很快从四十多人增加到一百三十人。接着学校组织了全体师生学习党的总路线，大大提高了师生的社会主义觉悟，师生共同认识到学校能否办好的关键不在于条件的好坏，而在于有无雄心大志和革命干劲，有无依靠党的组织和群众办学的思想；而且，学校有利条件仍然很多，如学生大都是贫苦农民的子女，过去祖祖辈辈深受没有文化的痛苦，迫切要求提高文化。经过学习讨论，师生们树立了信心，一致表示要在党的领导下，用双手建设好自己的学校。
    我校本着勤俭办校、不伸手向国家要钱的原则，发动全体师生投入紧张的建校劳动，平山坡、砍荆棘，没有砖自己动手做土基，没有瓦分头到各村寨瓦窑收集。在各级党委和广大群众的大力支持下，经过半年的努力，新校舍终于建成了，公社将村前好地划给学校，作为生产劳动基地，并支援学校盖猪、羊厩的木料和砖瓦。师生养猪种菜，伙食随着改善，生活得到了安定。为了丰富同学的生活，我们大力开展了文体活动，师生们开辟了篮、排球场各一块，又用旧木料做了球架，单双杠也安起来了，还开辟了六十米的跑道。就这样，迅速地改变了学校面貌，为教学工作的开展创造了有利条件。
    大破“唯条件论”狠抓基础课程
    1959年初市委向全市教育战线发出了“精雕细刻，提高教学质量”的指示，给我校全体师生很大的启发和鼓舞，决心响应党的号召，迅速提高教学质量，向先进学校看齐。但这时个别教师信心不足，强调困难，怪学生底子差，他们说：“山区学校怎能赶得上城区？新校怎能赶得上老校？”把提高教学质量看得高不可攀，认为即使能提高也得慢慢来，但大多数教师认为事在人为，人能改变条件，学校党组织坚决依靠了大多数。经过一场激烈的辩论：“条件论”站不住脚了，全体师生紧紧地团结在党组织的周围，一条心，一股劲，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的教好学好的群众运动，把冲天的革命干劲和踏踏实实的工作结合起来，采取了一系列的措施，大抓基础课程。如语文教师根据山区民族学生的基础知识差、语言不同等情况，从标点符号、一个字、一个词、一个句子讲起，由浅入深逐步达到课程进度标准。教师们分析了每个班、每个学生的情况，不断进行排队，深入学生中进行备课。我们发现：由于少数民族的语法排列与汉语不同，有的少数民族学生总是把词的次序颠倒过来，教师们就细心收集、整理出课文中汉语词序与民族词序的对照表，帮助学生掌握。学生错别字多，各科教师就协助语文教师收集学生的错别字，整理出正误字对照表发给学生，大大减少了错别字。教师还规定学生每天写小楷，每周写周记，并采取背诵、默写等方法，使学生多读、多写、多用，巩固学得的成绩。如写小楷时，不仅练习字，还抄写课文、词句、学习应用标点符号。这些措施已收到了良好的效果。现在学生写字较公正，能够写比较流利的短文，能把学会的新词和周围的好人好事写进作文里。数学教师加强了基础概念的讲授和复习巩固工作，根据日常碰到的计算问题，编写了许多例题，帮助学生实际演算运用。学生原来不会认地图，地理教师就把地图剪开，让学生再合起来，使学生更牢固地记住了方向、位置和地形等。
    教学相长大搞群众运动
    教师在课前课后，总要听听学生的意见，改进教学。在休息时间，经常可以看到一群学生围着老师谈心，我们把这种谈心叫做“教学访问会”。学生对教师讲课的意见，除了在会上提出外，还可以写大字报。生物教师听说学生听不懂自己的课，就想方法备好课，向学生学习，向老农学习，努力结合生产实际进行教学。教师们还根据各个时期党的中心工作和国际国内形势，适当补充教材，增强教材的政治性和思想性。为了使同学们学得更好，教师们认真的集体备课，开展观摩教学，自习时跟班辅导，对成绩较差的同学还规定了专门的辅导时间，并组织成绩较好的同学进行互助。学校还组织教师四处取经，到昆明八中、九中、三中、七中、十七中等校参观访问，学习先进经验。并与八中挂钩，互派教师学习，我们把从兄弟学校学到的好经验，迅速在学校推广。在提高学生的学习自觉性积极性方面，我们除组织学生进城参观工厂、农场外，还请公社党委到学校作报告，讲山区的发展远景和对人材的需要，启发学生明确学习的目的，树立攀登文化科学高峰的雄心壮志。从1958年起，一直坚持大搞群众运动，根据每段时期要解决的问题，树立标兵，发动全体学生向标兵学习。最近在开展“做共产主义的好学生”运动中，经过评选，树立了六十多个标兵。并组织学生们讨论：“向标兵学习些什么？人家能做到的，我为什么做不到？”许多学生写下决心书，订出赶标兵规划。在运动的推动下，学生的学习热情普遍提高，学习成绩不断上升，优秀生大大增加。教育结合生产劳动
    全面提高教育质量
    在以教学为中心，全面贯彻教育方针的思想指导下，我们二十三中也比较好地解决了教育与生产劳动相结合的问题。全校师生除在建校初期积极地投入了建校劳动外，在农忙季节，还大力支援中心工作，积极参加社会活动。1959年内共帮助公社栽秧五十八亩，收割麦子、包谷、豆子等二百四十五亩，积肥三十万斤，修路三公里。还主动帮助区委、公社和管理区举办干部业余文化班和小学教师业余进修学校。最近，我们又协助管理区训练幼儿园和托儿所的保育员、教养员和卫生员。学校的劳动基地也已初具规模，目前全校师生共种菜地九十八亩（每人约合五分），养猪三十多头，羊六十多只，鸡一百五十只，还办了工厂，全校已经积累生产资金六、七千元。没有教具设备，师生就自己动手作了一百多种。通过劳动，教学质量迅速提高。以前学生作文干巴巴的，参加生产劳动后，有了感情，作文内容就丰富多了。数学、物理等课程也结合生产劳动自编习题，学生感到很有兴趣。学生对平方立方的概念不清楚，在挖土的时候，通过计算土方就比较深刻地理解了。在教学和劳动时间的安排上，实行“小一、一五”制，即五天上课，一天劳动，一天休息。每天晚上的时间基本上都留给教师备课、批改作业和下班辅导。学生每天下午有一个半小时的课外活动，晚上有八小时的睡眠时间。学校的文娱体育活动也很活跃。这样，既保证了劳动，学好了功课，又保证了师生的身心健康。
    尊师爱生，建立新型的师生关系
    学校对学生关怀备至，除政治等方面抓紧教育外，生活上也体贴入微，有的学生没有钱买书和用具，学校就用劳动收入给他们买；没有肥皂洗衣服，就把学校肥皂厂自制的发给他们用；天冷了，部分经济困难的学生没有冬衣，学校就给予补助。三班的祝增亮同学，出身贫农家庭，是个孤儿，又是烈属，社里和学校都给了不少帮助，但生活上仍有困难，冬天没有棉衣穿，老师知道这情况后就把自己的棉衣、球鞋和帽子送给他。祝增亮同学被感动得流下泪来。又如李永常同学病了，校长去看他，发现他脚后跟开裂流血了，就端了一盆热水，拿了一双鞋，亲自给他洗脚敷药。学生深受感动，更加发奋勤学，立志把学习搞好来报答党的关怀。学生也非常热爱学校，敬爱老师，星期天回家返校总要带一挑柴来给学校伙食团，遇上雨季总要带点新鲜的菌子给老师吃。在师生之间形成了崭新的关系。一年多来，除公社调走了一个学生外，没有一个学生流动离校。
    目前我校正在已取得成绩的基础上，进一步贯彻党的教育方针，深入开展教育革命，彻底进行教学改革，为提高教育质量而努力。
