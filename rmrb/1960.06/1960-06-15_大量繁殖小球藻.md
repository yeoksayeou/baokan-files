Mass Cultivation of Chlorella
By a commentator of this newspaper

The mass cultivation of chlorella is a tremendous achievement in our country’s agricultural scientific research, and also a great victory on our agricultural production front.

The purpose of developing production is to extract more useful material resources from the land and from nature in order to satisfy people's living needs. To achieve this goal, in our production practice, we are working hard to cultivate and utilize various crops that have already been recognized by people, and strive to increase their yields; on the other hand, we must constantly explore the secrets of nature and discover new material resources that can be used by people to make our lives richer and more colorful. The discovery and mass production of chlorella is an example of our further utilization of natural resources. People's understanding of nature and utilization of natural resources are gradually improved through production practice. In ancient times, humans drank blood and ate raw meat, and would not have used the crops that were later widely cultivated and eaten. Until recently, people mainly used the grains of crops, while stalks were generally only used as feed or fuel. Now, after comprehensive processing, many foods and industrial raw materials are extracted from crop stalks, roots, and shoots, which is a major advancement in mankind's understanding and utilization of natural resources. However, the resources in nature that can be utilized are definitely not limited to those that have already been utilized. There are many undiscovered and unutilized things around us, which will be discovered and utilized with the gradual improvement of people's scientific and technological level, and with the further improvement of people's understanding of nature and mastery of objective laws.

Chlorella is a single-celled aquatic plant, very small in size, but very rich in nutrients. According to the analysis of scientific research departments, chlorella dry powder contains about 45% protein, which is equivalent to 110% of the soybean content, and two to three times higher than the content of bran and barley. In addition, it also contains about 15% fat, a large amount of carbohydrates, and various vitamins. Oils, chlorophyll and other light industrial raw materials and medicines can be extracted from chlorella, which has considerable economic value.

Chlorella is not only rich in nutrients, but also reproduces quickly and yields high, and is quite convenient to cultivate. Under suitable conditions, a single chlorella can reproduce more than 40 in a day and night, and mature in five or six days; under normal circumstances, it can be harvested more than 30 times a year; one mu of water surface can produce 600,000 to 800,000 jin of chlorella concentrate annually, which can be made into about 10,000 jin of dry powder. Many places use chlorella as pig feed. According to feeding comparison tests, one jin of chlorella concentrate is equivalent in nutrition to two jin of fine bran, one and a half jin of wheat bran, or two jin of soybean cake powder. The Wenzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Research Institute in Zhejiang Province conducted an experiment with two piglets born at the same time, one fed chlorella in its feed and the other not. After ten months, the weight difference between the two pigs was 105 jin. According to statistics from Jiangdian Commune in Wuyang County, Henan Province, pigs fed with chlorella gained an average of about nine liang of fat per day, while those fed with the same amount of other feed only gained five liang, a difference of about one-fold. Not only that, chlorella also has the effect of promoting the recovery of sick pigs, promoting pregnancy and multiple births in sows, promoting milk production in dairy cows, and restoring egg-laying function in hens. Mass cultivation of chlorella has a great effect on the high-speed development of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising.

The cultivation of chlorella has been carried out in many communes and production teams, and rich experience has been gained. From a regional point of view, it can be cultivated from Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan in the south to Shanxi, Hebei and Liaoning in the north, and has already been cultivated. Developing chlorella production is possible in all parts of our country. All localities should immediately take action to vigorously promote existing experience, so that the cultivation of chlorella can be developed more quickly.

    大量繁殖小球藻
    本报评论员
    小球藻的大量繁殖，是我国农业科学研究工作的一项巨大收获，也是我国农业生产战线上的一个伟大胜利。
    发展生产的目的，就是要向土地、向大自然索取更多有用的物质资料，以满足人们的生活需要。为了达到这个目的，我们在生产实践中，一方面努力培植和利用已经被人们认识了的各种作物，努力提高它们的产量；一方面要不断探索大自然的秘密，发现新的能供人们使用的物质资料，使我们的生活更加丰富多彩。小球藻的发现和大量生产，就是我们进一步利用自然资源的一个实例。人对自然的认识，对自然资源的利用，都是通过生产实践逐步提高的。远古时代，人类茹毛饮血，对于后来大量栽培和食用的农作物，是根本不会利用的。就在不久以前，人们对农作物还主要是利用它们的籽粒，至于秸秆，一般只用作饲草或燃料。现在经过综合加工，从农作物秸秆根梢中提制了很多食品和工业原料，这是人类对自然资源的认识和利用的一大进步。但是自然界可以利用的资源，决不止现在已经利用了的这些。在我们周围还有很多没有被发现、没有被利用的东西，它们将随着人们科学技术水平的逐步提高，随着人们对自然的认识、对客观规律的掌握的进一步提高，而被发现被利用起来。
    小球藻是一种单细胞水生植物，体积很小，但养分非常丰富。根据科学研究部门的分析，小球藻干粉中含有蛋白质45％左右，相当于大豆含量的110％，比麸皮、大麦的含量要高两三倍。此外，还含有15％左右的脂肪、大量的碳水化合物和各种维生素。从小球藻中可以提取油脂、叶绿素等轻工业原料和医药用品，经济价值相当高。
    小球藻不仅养分丰富，而且繁殖快、产量高，培养也相当方便。在适宜条件下，一个小球藻一昼夜就能繁殖四十多个，五六天就可成熟；在一般情况下，一年可以收获三十多次；一亩水面每年能生产小球藻浓缩液六十万到八十万斤，可制干粉一万斤左右。很多地方都把小球藻用作养猪饲料。根据饲养对比试验，一斤小球藻浓缩液的营养，相当于二斤细糠、一斤半麸皮或者二斤豆饼粉。浙江温州专区农业科学研究所用两只同时生的小猪进行试验，一只在饲料中加喂小球藻，一只没有加喂，十个月后，两只猪的体重相差一百零五斤。河南舞阳县姜店公社统计，喂小球藻的猪，平均每天增膘九两左右，喂同量其他饲料的只增膘五两，相差一倍左右。不仅如此，小球藻还有促使病猪恢复健康，促使母猪怀胎和多产仔猪，促使乳牛增奶和恢复母鸡生蛋功能的效能。大量繁殖小球藻，对高速度发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产有很大的作用。
    小球藻的培养，已在不少公社和生产队开展起来，并取得了丰富的经验。从地区上看，南至广东、广西和云南，北至山西、河北、辽宁，都能培养，都已培养。发展小球藻生产在我国各个地方都是可能的。各地应当立即行动起来，大力推广已有的经验，使小球藻的培养工作更快地发展起来。
