Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st -- The Japan Socialist Party announced this afternoon that it is preparing to take the emergency measure of resigning en masse to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet, in order to prevent the Diet from ratifying the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

This statement was issued after a joint meeting of Socialist Party members of both houses of the Diet approved the suggestion of the Diet members' resignation.

The statement said, "The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided on June 1st to submit a proposal to the extraordinary party convention to be held on June 6th for the collective resignation of all 125 members of the House of Representatives of the Japan Socialist Party." "Our reason for making this important decision is that we want to quickly end the current turbulent political situation in Japan, realize the dissolution of the House of Representatives to prevent the ratification of the new security treaty that contains the danger of dragging the Japanese people into war, and revive the Diet, which has been destroyed by the Kishi Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, with the power of the people."

The statement said, "Today, the vast majority of sovereign citizens are demanding the resignation of the Kishi Cabinet and the dissolution of the House of Representatives. This is an unshakable fact in anyone's eyes. However, Prime Minister Kishi, who holds the power to force the entire Cabinet to resign and dissolve the House of Representatives, is defying the will of the people by openly stating that 'there is no need to implement collective resignation and dissolve the Diet,' and is trying to ratify the new security treaty and maintain power. These are all hateful provocations against the people. Under these circumstances, we have no choice but to take the extraordinary measure of resigning all members of the Diet in order to dissolve the House of Representatives and realize the wishes of the people."

The statement said that, of course, there may be some people among the people who doubt the significance and effect of this decision. However, if we want to respond to the expectations of millions and tens of millions of people for us, then this path is the only one left and also the inescapable obligation given to us.

The statement concluded, "We hope that all the people will support our determination and work together in full cooperation until the final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st -- Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma delivered a speech at a meeting of all members of the Socialist Party today, expressing his determination to fight the Kishi Nobusuke clique. He said that the Diet has been dead since the day the Kishi Nobusuke clique brought the police into the Diet on May 19th. Our party has now reached an important turning point and should fully respect the will of party members, unite as one, and move towards the goals of dissolving the Diet, preventing the ratification of the "security treaty," and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st -- Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) Akira Iwai met with Chairman of the Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma and Secretary-General Saburo Eda today to study the issue of intensifying the struggle to force the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to step down, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "security treaty."

Akira Iwai demanded that the Socialist Party fight in step with the "Sohyo's" general strike.

Asanuma talked about the Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives resigning en masse to force the dissolution of the Diet.

    不能容许岸信介集团借国会名义倒行逆施
    日本社会党宣布准备采取紧急措施
    社会党众议员将全体辞职迫使解散国会
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午发表声明，宣布要采取全体众议员辞职的紧急办法迫使岸信介政府解散国会，以便阻止国会批准日美军事同盟条约。
    这项声明是在社会党参众两院议员联席会议同意议员辞职的建议以后发表的。
    声明说，“社会党中央执行委员会会议1日决定要在本月6日举行的临时党代表大会上提出日本社会党众议院议员一百二十五人全体辞职的议案”。“我们决心作出这个重要决定的理由是，因为我们要迅速结束目前日本的动荡的政治情况，实现解散众议院，以阻止批准含有把日本国民卷入战争的危险的新安全条约，并且用国民的力量使被岸内阁和自由民主党所毁灭的国会复活。”
    声明说，“今天，拥有主权的国民的绝大多数正在要求岸内阁下台和解散众议院。无论在哪一个人的眼中，这都是不可动摇的事实。但是，掌握内阁全体辞职和解散众议院的权力的岸首相违背国民的这个意志，公然表示‘没有必要实行全体辞职和解散国会’，力图批准新安全条约并保持政权，这些都是对国民表现了可憎的挑衅态度。在这种情况下，我们不得不采取全体议员辞职这样一种非常手段，以便解散众议院，实现国民的愿望”。
    声明说，当然，在国民中间也许会有一些人对这个决定的意义和效果感到怀疑。但是，如果我们想要回答几百万、几千万国民对我们的期望，那么，这条道路是剩下来的唯一的道路，也是给予我们的义不容辞的义务。
    声明最后说，“我们希望全体国民支持我们这个决心，共同实行全面合作，直到获得最后的胜利。”
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天在社会党全体议员会议上发表谈话，表示了同岸信介集团斗争的决心。他说，自从岸信介集团在5月19日把警察引进国会这一天起，国会已经死亡。我们党目前已经到了重要的转变时期，应当充分尊重党员的意志，团结一致，向着解散国会、阻止批准“安全条约”、打倒岸信介内阁的目标前进。
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章今天会见社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和书记长江田三郎，研究了加紧展开斗争迫使岸信介内阁下台、解散国会和阻止批准新日美“安全条约”问题。
    岩井章要求社会党同“总评”的大罢工统一步调进行斗争。
    浅沼谈到了社会党众议员将以总辞职迫使国会解散的问题。
