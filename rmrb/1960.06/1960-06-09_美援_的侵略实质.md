“U.S. aid” is the main tool for the United States to plunder and enslave other countries, and it is the product of the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism. This has already been proven by the entire history of "U.S. aid" after the war. However, recently, on the one hand, the figures of the US ruling group have tried their best to make a "peaceful" gesture and vigorously promoted that the United States will fully "aid" underdeveloped countries to get rid of poverty; on the other hand, international revisionists are spreading the fallacy that the nature of US imperialism has changed and a "new era" of "economic cooperation" has emerged. Therefore, it is inevitable that some people will be blinded and produce illusions about "U.S. aid."

However, the essence of "U.S. aid" and the nature of U.S. imperialism can never be concealed by Eisenhower and his ilk with such sweet-sounding words as "helping underdeveloped countries is a responsibility that the United States cannot evade."

As long as you browse through this page of "aid" history, it is not difficult to see what kind of content the "economic cooperation" between the United States and the oppressed nations advocated by today's imperialist politicians and Yugoslav revisionists really is.

The Disasters Created by "U.S. Aid"

The United States has been providing "aid" to underdeveloped countries for nearly fifteen years. According to a report by the US government itself last March, there were more than fifty underdeveloped countries that received "aid" from the United States from 1948 to 1958. The amount of "aid" was more than 25 billion US dollars. But what is intriguing is that none of the underdeveloped countries that have received US "aid" have achieved real economic progress, but instead are burdened with debts and the people's lives are becoming more and more impoverished. According to the World Bank's report at the beginning of this year, from 1955 to 1958, the long-term and medium-term debts of nineteen Central and South American countries increased from 3.7 billion US dollars to 5.2 billion US dollars. The foreign debts of eleven Asian and Middle Eastern countries (excluding Japan) increased from 1.9 billion US dollars to 3.9 billion US dollars. The foreign debts of four African countries increased from 1.1 billion US dollars to 1.4 billion US dollars. The biggest creditor of these debts is none other than the United States. Because everything in these countries depends on it, they are increasingly manipulated by it. However, it should be particularly pointed out that despite constantly receiving "aid" from the United States, none of these underdeveloped countries has been able to change the backward situation of relying on exporting a small number of raw materials and agricultural products to maintain their national livelihoods. Pakistan, which has received "U.S. aid" for ten years, still exports two-thirds of its jute and cotton, and still does not have its own steel industry. Iran, which the British "Mirror" calls "a satellite country of the United States," has received "U.S. aid" for ten years. Ten years ago, it relied on oil exports to maintain its national economy, and it is still the same today, with 20% of its annual national budget relying on "U.S. aid" to make up for it. Others such as the Philippines, Thailand, Venezuela, Brazil... are still raw material supply bases for U.S. imperialism. "U.S. aid" has not given them any help in this regard.

Not only that, but underdeveloped countries that receive "U.S. aid" generally experience the situation of becoming more impoverished the more "aid" they receive. Turkey, which has received nearly 2.5 billion US dollars in "aid" from the United States since 1948, is the most typical example. First it accepted the "Truman Doctrine," then the "Marshall Plan," then in 1949 it accepted the US "Cultural and Technical Cooperation Aid," then it received Truman's "Point Four Program" technical assistance, then in 1952 it obtained "Mutual Security Program Aid," and then in 1957 it accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Indeed, Turkey can be regarded as the first in terms of the variety of US "aid" it has received. But Turkey's economy is also the worst. Budget deficits, trade deficits, and international balance of payments deficits have not been interrupted for a single year since 1948. Turkey not only needs to borrow money from the United States every year, but also has to beg from countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" such as West Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium. According to a report in the British "Financial Times" on May 13 this year, Turkey's foreign exchange reserves today are not only "empty" but also owe 1.4 billion US dollars in foreign debt. Since 1950, its currency has fallen by 70%. The result of the exhaustion of the people's wealth and the people's inability to make a living finally led to the collapse of the US puppet Menderes regime.

The more "aid" received, the more impoverished, is not surprising. Because the two components of "U.S. aid": military "aid" and economic "aid" are both harming the economies of the "aid"-receiving countries. Military "aid" is premised on the "aid"-receiving countries having to greatly increase military spending. According to the US President, for every dollar the United States spends on military "aid," the "aid"-receiving country has to spend five dollars on military spending. This leads to a substantial increase in the military budgets of the "aid"-receiving countries, resulting in severe inflation and economic imbalances. Thailand, Pakistan, Turkey, etc., are all examples of economies on the verge of bankruptcy due to military spending accounting for nearly half of the budget and the burden being too heavy.

Economic "aid" is also harming the economies of "aid"-receiving countries in the same way. Because, first, the vast majority of US economic "aid" is disguised military "aid." The two major projects in the "Mutual Security Program" (i.e., the US government's "foreign aid program") that account for more than half of economic "aid": "Defense Support" and "Special Assistance" belong to this category. The way to provide these two types of "aid" is to export a large number of surplus agricultural products and consumer goods to the "aid"-receiving countries for sale, and then use the money to "subsidize" the military budgets of the "aid"-receiving countries. Although this kind of "aid" can enable the governments of some countries to get through financial difficulties for a certain period of time, it is just like "drinking poison to quench thirst." The large number of agricultural products and American goods flooding the market inevitably cause the prices of grains and related commodities in the "aid"-receiving countries to plummet, eventually leading to the closure of a large number of enterprises and agricultural bankruptcy. Pakistan, Iran, Brazil, etc. are examples of many factories closing down and agricultural production declining after receiving "U.S. aid," and they are becoming increasingly dependent on imports of US grain and consumer goods every year.

Secondly, even non-military economic "aid," such as the "Development Loan Fund" and "Technical Assistance" in the US "Mutual Security Program," loans from the US "Export-Import Bank," and loans from the "World Bank" and "International Monetary Fund" manipulated by the United States, are also destroying the economies of the "aid"-receiving countries. The reason is that these "aids" are generally attached with harsh conditions that damage the sovereignty of the "aid"-receiving countries. Leaving aside the political conditions that interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, in terms of economic conditions alone, the most common is to require the "aid"-receiving countries to relax import restrictions on American goods, relax foreign exchange controls, and create a "good climate" for the import of American private capital. In domestic economic policies, under the pretext of preventing inflation, they are required to slow down the pace of industrialization and try their best to develop private enterprises instead of developing state-owned enterprises. This situation has become a prerequisite that underdeveloped countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America must accept in order to receive "U.S. aid," especially to obtain a large amount of "U.S. aid." Since 1953, the US "Export-Import Bank" and the "World Bank" have interrupted loans to Brazil because Brazil refused to amend its "Petroleum Law" stipulating the nationalization of petroleum. Obviously, any country that accepts these conditions will inevitably make its own weak national industry unable to develop in the face of the competition of the powerful American industry, and make the country's economic lifeline manipulated by American monopoly groups, allowing the United States to plunder it.

In fact, even if some "aid"-receiving countries agree to these enslavement conditions and receive "U.S. aid," they cannot use it to develop their own national industries. US "aid" has always stipulated that it can only be used to develop agriculture, build roads, ports, and develop hydropower projects. For example, the "World Bank's" loans to Latin American countries in 1957 were allocated according to purpose: electricity 39.5%, transportation 33%, agriculture 20.6%, and industry only 6.9%, and in industry, it was mainly used for light industry and semi-processing of local raw materials. The situation of US loans to underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa is the same. The Hoover Commission, which studied the issue of reorganizing foreign "aid" agencies in 1955, clearly stated: "In the Asia-Africa region, except for industries that produce war materials, no large industries should be established." It is no wonder that countries such as the Philippines, Pakistan, and Brazil have repeatedly asked Washington for loans to develop their basic industries, but they have all been rejected. This is not surprising, because the US "aid" to underdeveloped countries is only to deepen the latter's dependence on it, increase their colonial and semi-colonial economic forms, and make it more difficult for them to achieve economic independence.

What is the Purpose of "U.S. Aid"?

Since "U.S. aid" has nothing in common with the goal of truly helping underdeveloped countries develop their economies, whether from the effect or the approach, then what is the purpose of "U.S. aid"?

The answer is: "U.S. aid" itself is not the purpose, it is just a tool for the United States to pursue an aggressive foreign policy. On January 14 this year, when Eisenhower submitted his execution report on the "Mutual Security Program" to the US Congress, he said: "The military, economic, and technical assistance provided by the Mutual Security Program is necessary to achieve the goals of our foreign policy." Last March, US Secretary of State Herter testified in the Senate for the "foreign aid" plan, saying: "If we do not vigorously use the foreign aid plan, the US foreign policy will become powerless." And Lippmann said unambiguously as early as April 1958: "There is no way to separate (US foreign) policy from foreign aid. Foreign aid is simply, almost entirely, the money needed to make the policy work... because the foreign aid program is essentially a tool of US foreign policy, and its purpose is to serve the national interests of the United States."

The goal of US foreign policy is to dominate the world, which is well known. At the beginning of 1956, oil tycoon Rockefeller wrote in a secret letter to Eisenhower: "To put it simply and concisely, our (foreign) policy must be both 'global' and 'overall'; the so-called 'global' means to include every part of the world, and the so-called 'overall' means to (use) political, psychological, economic, military, and special methods, and combine these methods into a whole." This shows that in order to achieve the goal of dominating the world, the US ruling group must implement its aggressive policy from politics, economy, military to psychology. "U.S. aid" is an important weapon used to implement this comprehensive aggressive policy. Military "aid" directly serves the purpose of military control. Economic "aid" not only paves the way for economic, political, and military control, but is also a means of psychological control. For example, sending a large number of engineering, technical personnel, health education experts to underdeveloped countries through "technical assistance," spreading "American civilization," and "cultivating" "talents" of American standards in the local area belong to this category.

It is precisely because "U.S. aid" is an important weapon for implementing aggressive policies in the eyes of the US ruling group, so wherever the spearhead of U.S. imperialism points, there it becomes the focus of "U.S. aid." This has become a law.

After the war, in order to control Western European countries, "U.S. aid" once focused on this region, and controlled the military, political, and economic life of Western Europe through the "Marshall Plan." Recently, in order to seize the vast intermediate zone, the United States has shifted the focus of "U.S. aid" to underdeveloped countries. Their intention in doing so is very obvious. At the beginning of 1957, the "New York Times" pointed out that the reason why the United States needs to "aid" underdeveloped countries is because: "First, the United States needs to rely on foreign supplies for many raw materials. Three-quarters of the strategic materials come from underdeveloped countries, and Asia supplies six-fifths of the world's natural rubber and one-half of the tin. Second, underdeveloped countries will be a market with great potential. The amount of American goods they currently use is twice the amount at the end of World War II and five times the amount in 1938... Third, the political and strategic interests of the United States in these backward regions are particularly important."

It can be seen that the US policy towards underdeveloped countries mainly focuses on plundering raw materials, exporting capital, finding markets, and establishing strategic bases. And the reason why the United States wants to speed up its pace and provide them with "aid" is because it is afraid that these countries will achieve true independence. The US President said uneasily in his "foreign aid" message last March, targeting the national liberation movement: "In almost ten years, a political revolution on a world scale has swept countries that account for a quarter of the world's population... making them get rid of colonial status and move towards independence, and other countries are following closely behind... In the early days of independence, the people of these new countries are full of nationalistic enthusiasm. Unless this enthusiasm is directed towards beneficial purposes, it may lead to harmful developments."

Of course, the reason why the US ruling group is afraid that underdeveloped countries will achieve true independence is because the United States is the largest plunderer of underdeveloped countries. This is true whether from the amount of investment, commodity dumping, high-interest exploitation, resource plunder, market manipulation, and unequal exchange in underdeveloped countries. In terms of the scale of foreign investment, as early as 1949, US foreign investment exceeded the total foreign investment of all other capitalist countries. The overseas investment of Britain, the old rentier country, is only one-third of its investment. And nearly half of the US private foreign direct investment is directed to underdeveloped countries. In this way, it has become the largest extractor of natural resources and cheap labor in underdeveloped countries. In addition, it also obtains great benefits from manipulating the trade of underdeveloped countries. More than half of the imports and exports of Latin America, more than a quarter of the imports and exports of Southeast Asia, and one-fifth of the imports and exports of the Middle East are monopolized by the United States. In some countries, this monopoly is particularly serious. In Venezuela, Latin America, 65% of imports come from the United States. In Liberia, Africa, US imports once accounted for 93% of the country's total imports. Therefore, within the scope of the capitalist world, as long as the United States slightly lowers the prices of raw materials in underdeveloped countries, or slightly raises the export prices of its industrial products, it can make underdeveloped countries suffer losses. And it is precisely using its own trade monopoly to manipulate market prices. The British "New Statesman" magazine pointed out in 1959 that because world raw material prices were lowered by 10% by Western countries in 1957, "the losses suffered by raw material countries exceeded the total amount of Western and Soviet economic assistance they received in the previous five years." It can be seen that the so-called "aid" of the United States is nothing more than taking out a small portion of the huge profits it plundered from underdeveloped countries as bait in order to obtain greater benefits.

The Background and Evolution of "U.S. Aid"

So what is the background of the emergence of "U.S. aid"?

The United States' vigorous use of "U.S. aid" as an aggressive tool after World War II is inseparable from the development of the international situation after the war, the changes in the balance of power in international relations, and the intensification of the struggle between imperialist countries for colonies.

The result of World War II led to the emergence of a powerful socialist camp with one billion people, which greatly reduced the territory controlled by imperialist countries. In this way, the struggle between imperialist countries for colonies and spheres of influence became more intense, and the balance of power between the major countries in the capitalist world also changed greatly. The old colonial countries in Western Europe were greatly weakened, while the economic and military strength of the United States was further enhanced, giving the United States favorable conditions to squeeze out the forces of countries such as Britain and France. However, at the same time, the movement of oppressed nations to fight for independence and liberation after the war was unprecedentedly high, and a large number of countries in Asia and Africa gained independence. Under such a situation, in order to seize raw material production areas and sales markets from the old colonial countries and infiltrate the newly politically independent underdeveloped countries, the United States must take more cunning and roundabout methods. Therefore, the US ruling group hoisted the false banner of "anti-colonialism" and styled itself as a sympathizer of the oppressed nations. "U.S. aid" is precisely the product of adapting to this policy. The United States believes that the use of this technique can both conceal its aggressor's face and overwhelm Western European imperialist countries with its strong economic strength, making it impossible for them to compete with it in this regard. Because underdeveloped countries have been universally impoverished by the long-term plunder of imperialism, they are eager to obtain foreign investment to establish and develop their own national industries, which gives the United States favorable conditions to peddle "U.S. aid."

However, because "U.S. aid" is both a tool for plundering foreign people and a tool for plundering domestic people, it is destined to be opposed by all parties. In fact, "U.S. aid" itself is full of various contradictions. It is not only a case of selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head in form and content, trying to plunder and control other countries while winning people's hearts; but also there is a great contradiction between the so-called military "aid" and economic "aid." As mentioned earlier, the United States wants to use these two types of "aid" to achieve the goal of controlling underdeveloped countries, so that they can play a role of mutual complementation and mutual promotion; economic "aid" paves the way for military "aid" (that is, military control), and military "aid" in turn provides a guarantee for economic plunder. But these two types of "aid" destroy each other. For example, the more military "aid" an underdeveloped country receives, the larger its military budget, the more unstable its finances, and the more turbulent its politics. This not only makes it difficult for American private capital to invest, plunder raw materials, or dump goods locally, thereby failing to obtain economic benefits, but also puts a heavy burden on the United States. It has to take out a large amount of taxpayers' money year after year to subsidize these countries that bear excessive armaments. Because if it does not support them, these countries will experience serious political and economic crises, and may even shake the US control position. The recent fierce political changes in Turkey and South Korea, which have received the most "aid," and have greatly shaken the US ruling position, are excellent illustrations.

For example, the United States makes "aid"-receiving countries more and more unable to get rid of "U.S. aid." This was originally a technique consistently used by the United States to control underdeveloped countries. However, the consequences brought about by this approach have become the opposite of the original purpose. Because the United States' ambitions for expansion are too great, and "U.S. aid" is "given" too widely, the US fiscal budget has become increasingly unsustainable in recent years, and it cannot meet the requirements of various "aid"-receiving countries. As a result, there are too few porridge and too many monks, and complaints are rising, which has strengthened the dissatisfaction of these countries that rely on "U.S. aid" with the United States.

Tactics Have Changed but the Essence Remains the Same

Recently, as the United States has tried to use a "friendly, peaceful, and friendly" posture to win over and control the Asian, African, and Latin American national independent countries in order to seize the "intermediate zone," "U.S. aid," as a tool of US foreign policy, has also shown corresponding tactical cooperation in its approach. The first is to relax the conditions for providing "aid" to countries that do not assume military obligations: to increase economic "aid" to them, reduce loan interest rates, and no longer rigidly require the conclusion of military or economic alliances as a prerequisite. The second is to unite and use the power of industrial countries in the capitalist world to jointly provide "aid" to underdeveloped countries. The steps that have been taken in this regard are: increasing the lending capacity of international financial institutions manipulated by the United States, doubling the investment of the "World Bank," increasing the investment of the "International Monetary Fund" by 50%, and actively preparing to establish a "International Development Association" (also known as the Second World Bank) under the "World Bank" to provide loans to underdeveloped countries on relatively lenient terms. In addition, the Pan American Bank, which provides loans to Latin American countries, has also been formally established in the Western Hemisphere.

This series of new postures of "U.S. aid" certainly does not indicate that its essence has really changed. This is nothing more than the "casting a long line to catch a big fish" technique mentioned in Rockefeller's secret letter to Eisenhower in 1956. In Rockefeller's words, the United States should "act carefully and patiently... when providing 'aid' to countries that are unwilling to ally... In the initial stage... limit ourselves to obtaining very moderate political concessions as the price of economic assistance (in certain special circumstances - we can even do without any concessions). But at a later stage, we will be able to put forward our political prices and our military demands." Fulbright, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said not long ago that the United States should be "more sophisticated, humble, skilled, and smart" in dealing with nationalist countries.

Secondly, this "generous" posture of the United States in its foreign "aid" policy is certainly also a last resort under the influence of the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. As early as June 1958, the US State Department published a booklet saying that the Soviet Union's new strategy of economic assistance "is the most dangerous to the survival of the West, even more dangerous than the threat of war." At that time, the "New York Times" suggested in an editorial entitled "The Communist Economic Offensive": "Our economic assistance plan must be large enough in scale and executed cleverly enough to meet the Soviet challenge in this regard." Until recently, US Secretary of State Herter reluctantly admitted when testifying in the US Congress for the US government's "foreign aid" plan: "A very attractive feature of the aid from the Soviet Union and China to aid-receiving countries is that it is apparently willing to provide the kind of plan that an underdeveloped country needs without stipulating the economic conditions for obtaining this plan, nor does it try to make the government of this country change various economic policies. This group does not seem to require the various audit work stipulated in the US plan."

Of course, these remarks are trying their best to confuse the foreign aid of socialist countries and the foreign "aid" of imperialist countries, which are two things with completely different class positions and natures. But it can also be seen from here that it is precisely the selfless assistance of socialist countries that has forced the United States to slightly lower its extortion conditions, but it is impossible for US imperialism to "follow suit." Because the plundering and controlling nature of US imperialism over aid-receiving countries inevitably leads to an irreconcilable contradiction with the development of national economies in underdeveloped countries. Take the development loan fund specially established by the United States for underdeveloped countries as an example. Not only is the loan interest rate (3.5% to 5.5%) higher than that of the Soviet Union (2% to 2.5%), and it is attached with various conditions (the loan country must be "free from communist control," must implement embargo policies against the Soviet Union, the planned project must be suitable, sound, and must be unable to obtain assistance from other sources such as private capital, and must have the ability to repay debts, etc.), but also in October last year, it was stipulated that the "aid"-receiving country must use this loan to buy expensive American goods. The implementation of this measure will increase the cost paid by India, which accepts more of this loan, by at least 40%. No wonder this restriction was announced. It has caused accusations from many "aid"-receiving countries. But US decision-makers have no choice but to take this step for the profits of US monopoly capital.

The people of underdeveloped countries, who have suffered enough from the scourge of "U.S. aid," are seeing the aggressive nature of "U.S. aid" more and more clearly. For example, World Federation of Trade Unions Vice President and Latin American Labor Federation Chairman Toledano pointed out at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting this time that the US "aid" to Latin American countries is nothing more than to destroy the development of the national economies of these countries, take huge profits from the land of Latin America, so that the people of Latin America cannot use their natural resources to promote their independent progress, hinder the independent industrialization of these countries, and stop the expansion of our nascent democratic system.

The "Pakistan Times" also published an article on May 31, asking Pakistan not to accept "U.S. aid." The article said: The United States and Britain are doing everything possible to prevent countries that provide them with agricultural products from industrializing. They focus "aid" on agriculture and similar non-basic industries, which makes these "aid"-receiving countries more and more dependent on industrialized countries.

In fact, Lenin had already pointed out in 1916 the economic aggression technique of the United States using "aid" to tightly bind other formally "independent" countries financially without showing any signs of it. At that time, when he talked about the relationship between Britain and Argentina, he said that the latter had in fact become a commercial colony of Britain. Lenin also pointed out that Britain's large amount of investment in Argentina had established a very solid connection between British financial capital and the Argentine bourgeoisie and its leading figures in the entire economic and political life. He also used the sentence "the relationship between creditors and debtors is more solid than the relationship between sellers and buyers" to describe the more severe control of financial capital over colonies in the era of imperialism. It can be seen that "U.S. aid" is not only a powerful means of control, but also a means of buying people over. The spokespersons of imperialism and the Yugoslav revisionists are vigorously advocating "economic cooperation" with US imperialism. It is not difficult to see their malicious intentions.

### “美援”的侵略实质

    “美援”的侵略实质
    张振亚
    “美援”是美国掠夺和奴役其他国家的主要工具，是美帝国主义侵略政策的产物。这本来已由战后“美援”的全部历史所证实。但是最近一个时期，一方面由于美国统治集团人物竭力做出“和平”的姿态，大事宣传美国将全力“援助”不发达国家摆脱贫困；另一方面国际修正主义者又在散布美帝国主义本性已经改变，已经出现了“经济合作”的“新时代”的谬论。因此不免使一些人受到蒙蔽，产生了对“美援”的幻想。
    可是“美援”的实质和美帝国主义的本性绝不是艾森豪威尔之流能用“帮助不发达国家是美国不能规避的责任”这样一类娓娓动听的话所能掩盖得了的。
    只要翻阅一下这页“援助”的历史，就不难看出今天帝国主义的政客们和南斯拉夫修正主义者所宣扬的美国同被压迫民族之间的“经济合作”究竟是一种什么内容。
    “美援”制造的灾难
    美国向不发达国家提供“援助”已有近十五年的历史。根据去年3月美国政府自己的一项报告说，从1948年到1958年，受美国
  “援助”的不发达国家有五十多个。“援助”额在二百五十亿美元以上。但是耐人寻味的是，所有接受美国“援助”的不发达国家从没有一个获得真正的经济进展，反而都是债台高筑，人民生活愈来愈贫困。据世界银行今年年初的报告，从1955年到1958年十九个中南美国家的长期和中期债务从三十七亿美元增加到五十二亿美元。十一个亚洲和中东国家（不包括日本）的外债从十九亿美元增加到三十九亿美元。四个非洲国家的外债从十一亿美元增加到十四亿美元。这些债务的最大债主不是别人，正是美国。由于这些国家的一切都要依赖于它，于是就越来越受到它的操纵。不过特别应当指出的是尽管不断地接受着美国的“援助”，这些不发达国家中并没有哪一个能够改变过去依靠出口少数原料和农产品来维持国民生计的落后面貌。接受“美援”已有十年历史的巴基斯坦，目前出口的三分之二仍然是黄麻和棉花，而且至今没有自己的钢铁工业。被英国“镜报”称为是“已变成美国的卫星国”的伊朗，已接受了十年的“美援”。十年前它依靠石油出口维持国家经济，今天也依然如故，每年的国家预算的20％要靠“美援”弥补。其他如菲律宾、泰国、委内瑞拉、巴西……仍然是美帝国主义的原料供应基地。在这方面“美援”一点也没有给它们以帮助。
    不仅如此，接受“美援”的不发达国家普遍发生受“援”愈多、贫困愈甚的情况。从1948年至今接受了美国近二十五亿美元“援助”的土耳其就是一个最典型的例子。先是接受“杜鲁门主义”，然后是“马歇尔计划”，1949年它又接受美国的“文化技术合作援助”，以后再得到杜鲁门的“第四点计划”技术援助，1952年又取得“共同安全计划援助”，1957年再接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”。的确，土耳其接受美国“援助”种类之多，可算首屈一指了。但是土耳其的经济也最糟糕。预算赤字、贸易和国际收支的逆差从1948年以来就没有一年间断过。土耳其不仅每年需要向美国借钱，而且还得向“欧洲经济合作局”的国家如西德、法国、意大利、比利时等国乞讨。据今年5月13日英国“金融时报”的报道，土耳其今天的外汇储备不仅是“空无所有”而且欠了十四亿美元的外债。自1950年以来它的币值下跌了70％。民穷财尽，民不聊生的结果终于导致了美国傀儡曼德列斯政权的垮台。
    受“援”愈多，贫困愈甚，这是毫不奇怪的。因为“美援”的两个组成部分：军事“援助”和经济“援助”都在危害受“援”国的经济。军事“援助”是以受“援”国家必须大大增加军费为先决条件。照美国总统的说法就是美国在军事“援助”上每花一块钱，受“援”国就得在军费上花五块钱。这就使受“援”国大量增加军事预算，从而导致严重的通货膨胀和经济失调。泰国、巴基斯坦、土耳其等全都由于军费占近预算的一半，负担太重，经济濒临破产，就是例子。
    经济“援助”，也同样在危害受“援”国家的经济。因为第一、美国的经济“援助”的绝大部分是变相的军事“援助”。“共同安全计划”（即美国政府的“援外计划”）中占经济“援助”一半以上的两个大项目：“防御支持”和“特别援助”就属于这一类。提供这两种“援助”的方式都是以输出大量剩余农产品和消费物资到受“援”国家出卖，然后将卖得的款项用来“补助”受“援”国的军事预算。这种“援助”尽管也能使某些国家的政府在某一时期度过财政的难关，但只不过是“饮鸩止渴”，它们造成的大量农产品和美货充斥市场，不可避免地要引起受“援”国家的谷物和有关商品价格的暴跌，最后导致大批企业倒闭和农业破产。巴基斯坦、伊朗、巴西等在接受“美援”后，许多厂家倒闭，农业减产，每年越来越需要依赖美国粮食和消费物资进口就是例证。
    其次，即使非军事性的经济“援助”，如美国“共同安全计划”中的“开发贷款基金”和“技术援助”、美国“进出口银行”的贷款以及美国操纵下的“世界银行”和“国际货币基金组织”的贷款，也在破坏受“援”国的经济。原因是这些“援助”一般都附有损害受“援”国主权的苛刻条件。撇开干涉这些国家内政的政治条件不谈，单以经济条件来说，最常见的就是要受“援”国家放宽对美国货的入口限制，放松外汇管制，为美国私人资本的输入创造“良好的气候”。在国内经济政策上则以防止通货膨胀为借口，要它们放慢工业化的速度，尽力发展私人企业而不发展国营企业。这种情况已成为亚、非和拉丁美洲不发达国家接受“美援”，特别是取得大量“美援”所必须接受的前提。1953年以来，由于巴西拒绝修改它的规定石油国有化的“石油法”，美国“进出口银行”和“世界银行”就都曾中断对巴西的贷款。很显然哪个国家接受了这些条件，就必然会使本国幼弱的民族工业在强大的美国工业的竞争下无法发展，并使国家的经济命脉为美国垄断集团所操纵，任凭美国去掠夺。
    其实，一些受“援”国即使答应了这些奴役条件，拿到了“美援”，也不能把它用来发展自己的民族工业。美国的“援款”，一向规定主要只能用来发展农业，修建道路、港口、发展水电工程。譬如“世界银行”1957年对拉丁美洲国家的贷款按用途分配是：电气39．5％、交通运输33％、农业20．6％、工业只有6．9％，而在工业中又以用于轻工业和对当地原料的半加工工业为主。美国对亚洲和非洲不发达国家的贷款，情况也是一样。1955年研究改组对外“援助”机构问题的胡佛委员会就曾明白表示：“在亚非地区，除了生产战争物资的工业外，不应举办任何大工业。”难怪菲律宾、巴基斯坦、巴西等国家一再要求华盛顿给予贷款来发展它们的基本工业，都莫不遭到拒绝。这是毫不奇怪的，因为美国“援助”不发达国家只是为了加深后者对它的依赖，加重它们的殖民地、半殖民地型式的经济，使它们更难于取得经济独立。
    “美援”的目的何在
    “美援”既然无论从效果和作法上都同真正帮助不发达国家发展经济的目标毫无共同之处，那么“美援”的目的究竟是什么呢？
    答案是：“美援”本身根本不是目的，它不过是美国推行侵略外交政策的一个工具。今年1月14日艾森豪威尔在向美国国会提出他的“共同安全计划”的执行报告时就说：“共同安全计划提供的军事、经济和技术援助是实现我国外交政策目的所必须的。”去年3月美国国务卿赫脱在参议院为“援外”计划作证时则说：“如果不大力利用援外计划，美国的外交政策就会变得无能为力”。而李普曼早在1958年4月就毫不含糊地说：“没有办法把（美国的外交）政策同外援分开来，外援简直就是、差不多完全是使政策起作用所需的款子……因为外援计划本质上是美国外交政策的工具，目的是要为美国的国家利益服务。”
    美国外交政策的目标是要统治全世界，这是人所共知的。1956年初石油大王洛克菲勒在给艾森豪威尔的秘信中曾写道：“说得简单扼要一点，我们的（外交）政策必须既是‘全球的’又是‘总体的’；所谓‘全球的’是指要包括全世界每一个部分，所谓‘总体的’是指要（利用）包括政治、心理、经济、军事和特别的方法，而把这些方法结合为一个整体。”这就说穿了美国统治集团为了达到统治世界的目的，就要从政治、经济、军事一直到心理来推行它的侵略政策。“美援”正是推行这种全面的侵略政策而使用的一种重要武器。军事“援助”是直接为军事控制的目的服务。经济“援助”不仅为经济、政治和军事控制铺平道路，而且也是心理控制的一种手段。例如通过“技术援助”向不发达国家派出大批工程、技术人员、卫生教育专家，散播“美国文明”，并在当地“培育”美国标准的“人才”就属于这一类。
    正是因为“美援”在美国统治集团眼中是推行侵略政策的重要武器，因此美帝国主义的扩张矛头指向那里，那里就成了“美援”的重点，这已成为一种规律。
    战后美国为了控制西欧国家，“美援”就一度以这个地区为重点，通过“马歇尔计划”控制了西欧的军事、政治和经济生活。最近，为了夺取广大中间地带，美国又把“美援”重点移向不发达国家。他们这样做的意图很明显。1957年初“纽约时报”已指出，美国所以需要“援助”不发达国家是因为：“第一，美国的许多原料需要倚仗国外供应，四分之三的战略物资来自不发达国家，而亚洲供应着世界六分之五的天然橡胶和二分之一的锡，第二，不发达国家将是一个拥有极大潜力的市场。目前它们使用的美国货物已一倍于二次世界大战结束时的数量，五倍于1938年……。第三，在这些落后地区美国的政治和战略的利益，尤其重要。”
    由此可见美国对不发达国家的政策主要是着眼于掠夺原料、输出资本、寻找市场，并建立战略基地。而目前美国所以要加快步伐，向它们提供“援助”，是因为害怕这些国家取得真正的独立。美国总统去年3月在他的“援外”咨文中就针对民族解放运动不安地说：“差不多在十年时间内，一次世界规模的政治革命席卷了占世界人口四分之一的国家……使它们摆脱了殖民地地位而走向独立，其他国家正在后面紧跟上来……在独立初期，这些新国家的人民充满了民族主义的热情。除非把这种热情导向有益的目的，否则可能导致有害的发展。”
    当然，美国统治集团所以害怕不发达国家取得真正的独立，乃是因为美国是不发达国家的最大掠夺者。这无论从它对不发达国家的投资数量、商品倾销、高利盘剥、资源掠夺、市场操纵和不等价交换等任何一方面来看，都是如此。从国外投资规模来说，早在1949年美国对外投资就超过其他所有资本主义国家对外投资的总和。老牌的食利国英国在海外的投资也只有它的投资的三分之一。而美国的近一半私人国外直接投资正是输向不发达国家。这样，它就成为不发达国家天然富源和廉价劳动力的最大榨取者。另外，它还从操纵不发达国家的贸易中，取得莫大好处。拉丁美洲一半以上的进出口，东南亚四分之一以上的进出口，中东的五分之一的进出口，都为美国所垄断。在某些国家中，这种垄断情况尤其严重。拉丁美洲的委内瑞拉，65％的进口是来自美国。非洲的利比里亚，美国入口竟一度占这个国家总入口的93％。因此，在资本主义世界范围内，美国只要稍稍压低不发达国家的原料价格，或稍稍提高它的工业品出口价格，就能使不发达国家损失不资。而它也正是利用自己的贸易垄断地位来操纵市场价格。1959年英国“新政治家”周刊指出，由于1957年世界原料价格被西方国家压低了10％，“原料国家所受的损失超过了它们在前五年所接受的西方和苏联经济援助的总和。”可见美国的所谓“援助”也不过是把它掠夺自不发达国家的巨额利润的一小部分再拿出来作为钩饵以便取得更大的好处罢了。
    “美援”的背景和演变
    那么“美援”产生的背景又是怎样的呢？
    美国在第二次世界大战后大力利用“美援”这样一个侵略工具，是同战后国际形势的发展，国际关系中力量对比的变化，帝国主义国家争夺殖民地斗争的尖锐化分不开的。
    第二次世界大战的结果，导致了拥有十亿人口的强大社会主义阵营的出现，使帝国主义国家控制的地盘大大缩小。这样帝国主义国家争夺殖民地和势力范围的斗争更加激烈了，而在资本主义世界中各个主要国家间力量的对比也发生很大变化，西欧老牌殖民国家大为削弱，而美国的经济和军事实力却有了更大的增强，使美国有着有利的条件排挤英法等国家的势力。但是，同时战后被压迫民族争取独立解放的运动空前地高涨，在亚洲和非洲大批国家取得了独立。在这样一种形势之下，美国为了要从老牌殖民国家手中夺取原料产地和销售市场，向新获得政治独立的不发达国家渗透，就必须采取更狡猾、更迂回曲折的手段。于是美国统治集团就打起“反殖民主义”的假招牌，以被压迫民族的同情者自命。“美援”正是适应这一政策的产物。美国认为使用这一手法既能掩盖它的侵略者的面目，又能以它的雄厚经济实力压倒西欧帝国主义国家，使它们无法在这方面与它竞争。由于不发达国家长期受到帝国主义的掠夺而普遍贫困，因而渴望得到外资来建立和发展自己的民族工业，这就使美国兜销“美援”有着有利的条件。
    但是，由于“美援”既是掠夺国外人民的工具，也是掠夺国内人民的工具，所以它就注定要遭到各方面的反对。其实“美援”本身便充满了各种矛盾。它不仅在形式和内容上是挂羊头，卖狗肉，既要对其他国家进行掠夺和控制，又要赢取人心；而且在所谓军事“援助”和经济“援助”之间也存在着极大的矛盾。如前所述，美国要利用这两种“援助”来达到控制不发达国家的目的，使它们起相互补充、相互促进的作用；经济“援助”为军事“援助”（也就是军事控制）开路，而军事“援助”反过来又为经济掠夺提供保证。但是这两种“援助”却又互相破坏。譬如，一个不发达国家接受军事“援助”越多，它的军事预算就越庞大，财政也越不稳，政治也越动荡。这不但使美国的私人资本在当地投资、掠夺原料或倾销商品都发生困难，从而得不到经济利益，而且还使美国背上了一个沉重的包袱。不得不年复一年地拿出大量纳税人的钱来贴补这类承担军备过重的国家。因为如果不去扶持，这类国家就会发生严重的政治和经济危机，最后甚至动摇美国的控制地位。最近接受“援”最多的土耳其和南朝鲜发生激烈政变使美国统治地位大大动摇，就是极好的说明。
    又譬如，美国使受“援”国家越来越摆脱不开“美援”，这原是美国控制不发达国家所一贯使用的手法。但是，这种作法所带来的后果却成了原来目的的反对物。由于美国扩张的野心太大，“美援”“施舍”得过广，美国的财政预算近年来已日益不支，无法满足各个受“援”国的要求。结果形成粥少僧多，怨声四起，反而加强了这些依赖“美援”的国家对美国的不满。
    策略变了实质未变
    最近由于美国力图用“友好、和平和亲善”的姿态拉拢和控制亚、非和拉丁美洲各民族独立国家，以便夺取“中间地带”，“美援”，作为美国外交政策的工具，在作法上也出现了相应的策略上的配合。首先是放宽了对不承担军事义务的国家提供“援助”的条件：增加了对它们的经济“援助”，降低了贷款利息，不再僵硬地以缔结军事或经济联盟为前提。其次就是纠合和利用资本主义世界工业国家的力量向不发达国家联合提供“援助”。在这方面已采取的步骤是：增加了由美国所操纵的国际金融机构的贷款能力，把“世界银行”的投资增加了一倍，把“国际货币基金组织”的投资增加了50％，在“世界银行”下面积极筹设了用较宽的条件向不发达国家提供贷款的
  “国际开发协会”（又称第二世界银行）。另外在西半球还正式设立了向拉丁美洲国家提供贷款的泛美银行。
    “美援”的这一系列的新姿态当然不是表明它的实质真的有所改变。这不过是1956年洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的秘信中所说的“放长线、吊大鱼”的手法。用洛克菲勒的话来说，就是美国在对不愿结盟的国家提供“援助”时要“细心地和耐心地行动……在最初阶段中……限于获得非常适度的政治让步作为经济援助的代价（在某些特殊情况下——甚至可以不要任何让步）。可是在稍后一个时期，我们将可以提出我们的政治代价和我们的军事要求。”美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特不久前也说美国对待民族主义国家“要更世故、谦虚、技巧和聪明一点”。
    其次，美国在对外“援助”政策上的这种“宽大”姿态，当然也是在苏联无私援助的影响下不得已而为之。早在1958年6月，美国国务院就发表过一本小册子，说苏联经济援助的新策略，“对西方的生存来说，是最最危险的，甚至比战争的威胁更危险。”当时“纽约时报”在一篇题为“共产主义的经济攻势”的社论中建议：“我们的经济援助计划必须规模相当大，执行得相当巧妙，可以应付苏联在这方面的挑战。”直到不久前美国国务卿赫脱在美国国会为美国政府的“援外”计划作证时也无可奈何地承认：苏联和中国援助的“一个非常吸引受援国家的特点是，它表面上愿意提供一个不发达国家所需要的那种计划，而不规定取得这种计划的经济条件，也不设法使这个国家的政府改变各项经济政策。这个集团看来也不要求进行美国计划中所规定的各种查账工作”。
    当然这些言论都是竭力想把社会主义国家的对外援助同帝国主义国家的对外“援助”这两种阶级立场和性质完全不同的东西混为一谈。但是从这里也可以看出，正是社会主义国家的无私援助才迫使美国不得不稍微降低它的勒索条件，可是美帝国主义想“东施效颦”却是办不到的。因为美帝国主义掠夺和控制受援国的掠夺本性，使它必然与不发达国家发展民族经济这件事发生不可调和的矛盾。就以美国专门为不发达国家设立的开发贷款基金来说，不仅贷款利率（3．5％到5．5％）比苏联的（2％到2．5％）高，并附有各种条件（贷款国必须“不受共产主义控制”，必须执行针对苏联的禁运政策，计划中的工程必须是适宜的、健全的，必须是无法获得像私人资本这类其他来源的资助，必须有偿还债务能力等），而且在去年10月还规定受“援”国必须用这项贷款来买昂贵的美国货。实行这一措施对于接受这项贷款较多的印度来说，将使它付出的代价至少增加40％，无怪这项限制一公布。就引起许多受“援”国的责难。但是美国决策人为了美国垄断资本的利润，却不能不出此下策。
    受够了“美援”祸害的不发达国家人民，对“美援”的侵略实质是看得愈来愈清楚了。例如世界工联副主席、拉丁美洲劳联主席托列达诺这次在世界工联理事会会议上发言时就指出：美国对拉丁美洲国家的“援助”，只不过是为了破坏这些国家民族经济的发展，从拉丁美洲的土地上夺走巨额的利润，为了使拉丁美洲人民不能利用自己的天然资源来推进他们独立的进步，妨碍这些国家独立的工业化，制止我们刚开始的民主制度的扩大。
    “巴基斯坦时报”5月31日也发表文章，要求巴基斯坦不要接受“美援”。文章说：美国和英国千方百计不让那些为它们提供农产品的国家实行工业化。它们把“援助”重点放在农业和类似的非基本工业上，这样就使这些受“援”国不得不越来越依赖工业化的国家。
    其实美国通过“援助”从财政上不动神色地紧紧束缚其他形式上“独立”的国家的这种经济侵略手法，列宁早在1916年就已指出过。当时他在谈到英国与阿根廷的关系时，曾说到后者事实上已沦为英国的商业殖民地。列宁还指出英国在阿根廷的大量投资，使英国财政资本同阿根廷的资产阶级及其整个经济政治生活上的领导人物有了十分巩固的联系。他并且用了“债权人和债务人的关系，要比卖主和买主之间的关系更巩固些”这样一句话来形容帝国主义时代财政资本对殖民地的更厉害的控制。可见，“美援”既是一种厉害的控制手段，也是一种收买。帝国主义的代言人以及南斯拉夫修正主义者竟大力鼓吹同美帝国主义进行“经济合作”，其居心之恶毒就不难窥知了。
