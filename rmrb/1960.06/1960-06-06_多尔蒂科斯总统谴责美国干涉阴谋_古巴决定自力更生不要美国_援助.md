Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Rio de Janeiro Dispatch: Cuban President Dorticos, during a meeting with reporters at the Brazilian Press Association on June 2nd, stated that "the Cuban people will vow to fight to the death against all attempts at foreign interference." He said that the United States is spreading rumors that Cuba is implementing communism, with the aim of concealing its conspiracy to unite all aggressive forces against the Fidel Castro regime in order to destroy the Cuban revolutionary cause.

Dorticos said, "Cuba must be respected by foreign governments, and the kind of situation that occurred in the past, when Cuba intended to negotiate with the United States on the sugar issue, must not happen again." He pointed out that maintaining all existing provisions in the negotiations is a fundamental condition for international understanding, but the US government is attempting to interrupt the "Sugar Act" and grant Eisenhower unlimited power to reduce Cuba's sugar import quota.

When talking about the United States' cessation of "technical assistance" to Cuba, Dorticos said that the Cuban government does not mind this because this assistance was originally extremely limited, and even if the scale of this assistance were larger, Cuba would not need it. He said, "We advocate self-reliance and striving for development."

In his speech, Dorticos also condemned the United States for sheltering counter-revolutionary movements launched from Miami in the United States.

President Dorticos and his entourage, after arriving in Brazil's new capital, Brasilia, on May 31, were welcomed by the Brazilian Congress the next day. Congressman Passos of the Nationalist Parliamentary Front said in a welcoming speech to the Congress: "We must resist imperialist policies in order to strive to improve the living conditions of the people of all countries." He said that the Brazilian people value and admire the courage and determination of the glorious Cuban people.

    多尔蒂科斯总统谴责美国干涉阴谋
    古巴决定自力更生不要美国“援助”
    新华社4日讯　里约热内卢消息：古巴总统多尔蒂科斯2日在巴西新闻协会接见记者时说，“古巴人民将誓死与一切外国干涉的企图斗争到底。”他说，美国造谣说古巴在实行共产主义，其目的是企图掩盖它联合一切侵略势力反对菲德尔·卡斯特罗政权以摧毁古巴革命事业的阴谋。
    多尔蒂科斯说，“古巴必须受到外国政府的尊重，必须不再发生过去古巴打算同美国就食糖问题进行谈判时所发生的那种情况。”他指出，在谈判中保持现有的一切规定，是国际谅解的基本条件，可是美国政府竟企图中断“食糖法”，并授予艾森豪威尔以减少古巴糖进口份额的无限权力。
    多尔蒂科斯在谈到美国停止对古巴的“技术援助”这件事时说，古巴政府对此并不介意，因为这种援助本来是极其有限的，即使这种援助规模较大，古巴也不需要。他说、“我们主张自力更生争取发展。”
    多尔蒂科斯在发言中还谴责美国庇护从美国的迈阿密发动的反革命运动。
    多尔蒂科斯总统和他的随行人员在5月31日到达巴西新首都巴西利亚后，第二天受到巴西议会的欢迎。民族主义者议会阵线的议员帕索斯在议会致欢迎词时说：“我们必须抗击帝国主义政策，以便争取改善各国人民的生活条件”。他说，巴西人重视和钦佩光荣的古巴人民的勇敢和坚定精神。
