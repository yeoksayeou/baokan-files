    Comprehensive planning for the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw in conjunction with the wheat harvest is a matter of great economic value. In the past, in many places, wheat straw was mostly used as fuel or feed after the wheat harvest, and its role was not fully utilized, which is very regrettable.
    According to the successful experience of Lingbi County, Anhui Province, in the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw: every 100 jin of wheat straw can be made into 30 jin of 30-degree syrup, 8 jin of 55-degree wine, and 80 jin of vinegar. The remaining residue can also be used as pulp for papermaking. In this way, every 100 jin of wheat straw can generate approximately 30 yuan in revenue. The result of comprehensive utilization is that the value of wheat straw per mu greatly exceeds the value of wheat produced per mu. Lingbi County planted more than 1.73 million mu of wheat this year. Calculated at 120 jin of wheat straw left per mu, a total of 207.6 million jin of straw were harvested. If 30% of the county is used for comprehensive utilization, the county can generate an income of 18.68 million yuan. This is a very considerable income!
    Lingbi County is preparing to vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw this year. In addition to actively training technical personnel for the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw, it has also decided to use sugar factories, wineries, tannin extract factories, paper mills, and other units as key bases for the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw, so as to comprehensively promote the experience of comprehensive utilization of wheat straw through these units.
    This year, many regions have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of wheat. I suggest that Party committees and administrative departments in various places start early, fully mobilize the masses, and vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of wheat straw, which will not only increase the income of commune members but also increase the wealth of the country.

    把麦秆充分利用起来
    结合麦收全面安排小麦秸秆综合利用，是具有重大经济价值的事情。以往，许多地方麦收后，麦秸秆多用作燃料或饲料，没有能充分发挥秸秆的作用，这是非常可惜的。
    据安徽灵璧县综合利用麦秆的成功经验：每百斤麦秸可制成三十度的糖稀三十斤，五十五度酒八斤，醋八十斤，剩余的渣子还可以作为纸浆造纸。这样，每一百斤麦秸大约可收益三十元。综合利用的结果，使每亩地麦秸的价值大大超过每亩地所产小麦的价值。灵璧县今年共种小麦一百七十三万多亩，每亩以留麦秸一百二十斤计算，共收秸秆二亿零七百六十万斤，如果全县有30％用以进行综合利用的话，全县就可以收入一千八百六十八万元。这是一笔十分可观的收入！
    灵璧县今年准备大搞麦秸的综合利用，目前除积极训练综合利用麦秸的技术人员外，并决定以制糖厂、酿酒厂、栲胶厂、造纸厂等单位作为麦秸综合利用的重点基地，以便通过这些单位全面推广综合利用麦秸的经验。
    今年，不少地区小麦获得空前丰收。我建议各地党委和行政部门及早动手，充分发动群众，大搞麦秸的综合利用，这样既为社员增加收入，又为国家增加财富。中共灵璧县委财贸部长　周道秀
