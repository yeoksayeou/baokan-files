    "Four Members" Cadres Go to the Countryside
    Zhang Mingyi, Secretary of the CPC Chen County Committee, Hunan Province
    Seizing time is very important for all work. However, time has a special significance for agricultural production. As the saying goes, "Strive for the day in spring, strive for the hour in summer; it is better to be early than late in everything." This is a truth that has been repeatedly proven in the practice of agricultural production. Therefore, seizing the season, racing against time, and not missing the farming season are decisive keys to ensuring the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.
    However, to do things early and well, it is necessary to go deep into reality, deep into the masses, understand the situation in a timely manner, discover problems, and solve problems. Therefore, cadres going to the countryside is the key to getting things done early and well. On the basis of the great achievements already made in agricultural production last winter in our Chen County area, in order to further promote the agricultural production movement to a new climax, ensure that grain is the key link, and achieve an all-round Great Leap Forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and realize a thousand catties of grain and one pig per person, we have adhered to the method of combining general calls with individual guidance in our leadership methods. We emphasized going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and deep into the most basic level of production. Party secretaries at all levels in the entire region took the lead and organized more than 70,000 cadres to go deep into the front line of production—the production team's work groups. Therefore, this year's agricultural production has been grasped earlier and done better than in any previous year.
    Leading by example and organizing the vast number of cadres to go deep into the front line of production—the work group—is indeed an important measure for doing a good job in production. Many cadres are called "four members" by the masses—that is, they are both commanders, fighters, technicians, and propagandists. They say: "With 'four members' cadres going to the countryside, the leap forward in production is guaranteed."
    The main method for the vast number of cadres to command production, participate in production, and lead production with production is to vigorously develop high-yield fields. Grain, oil (camellia oil), and pigs are the main items of agricultural production in our region. Therefore, they universally adopted the method of combining cadres, veteran peasants, and technicians to carry out the movement of vigorously developing "high-yield rice fields, high-yield camellia oil mountains, and high-yield pig pens (or farms)." In the movement, each cadre took his own high-yield rice field, high-yield camellia oil mountain, and high-yield pig pen as a base for participating in and commanding production, first doing it well, taking the lead in everything, setting an example, and using it to sum up experience and discover problems. The cadres' high-yield rice fields, high-yield camellia oil mountains, and high-yield pig pens have become the banner of the masses' production and have been well received by the masses. The vast number of masses call them "command fields," "leading fields," and "model fields." The masses follow the cadres' example in their high-yield fields, vigorously promoting the production movement to rise step by step.
    The vast number of cadres exerted soaring energy in their work, not only working hard and practically, but also paying full attention to working cleverly, and mobilized the masses to vigorously develop a technical revolution movement to improve agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools. At present, the entire region has invented, created, and promoted various new-style tools for field production, transportation tools, agricultural and sideline product processing tools, animal husbandry feeding tools, and cafeteria cooking tools, greatly reducing labor intensity, improving labor efficiency, and promoting production. In the movement, many cadres served as leaders in experimenting with, researching, inventing, creating, and promoting the use of new-style tools. Liu Daben, the first secretary of the Lan Jia County Party Committee, and Comrade Cheng Liangqing, the Party Secretary of the Xinwei Commune in the county, experimented with the use of rice transplanters together with members of the third work group of the Xiaqinghan Production Team of the Xinwei Brigade of the commune, and found that the Type 59 rice transplanter still had shortcomings—it could not transplant short seedlings, the seedling distribution was uneven, and there were many floating seedlings. They immediately conducted on-site research and improvements with technicians and veteran peasants. A seedling dividing trough was installed under the seedling box, and 27 units were immediately modified together with workers from the machinery factory. After the modification, not only could short seedlings be transplanted, but the seedling division was more plentiful and neater, and there were no floating seedlings. In the movement to vigorously promote vehicle mechanization, the six secretaries of the commune each added a new-style tool and a vehicle, taking the lead in using them in production. Under their impetus, a mass movement to vigorously promote vehicle mechanization was quickly launched. This not only promoted production, but also further set off a new upsurge in the commune's agricultural technology revolution.

    “四员”干部下基层
    中共湖南郴县地委书记　张明义
    争取时间，对于一切工作都是十分重要的。然而，时间对于农业生产有着特别的意义。俗语说：“春争日，夏争时，百事宜早不宜迟”。这是在农业生产的实践中所反复证明了的道理。因此，抓季节、抢时间，不误农时，是保证农业生产持续大跃进带有决定性的关键。
    但是，要把事情办得早，做得好，就需要深入实际、深入群众，及时了解情况，发现问题，解决问题。因此，干部下基层，就是把事情办早办好的关键。我们郴县地区在去冬农业生产已经取得伟大成绩的基础上，为了进一步把农业生产运动推向新的高潮，确保以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进，实现每人千斤粮、一头猪，在领导方法上我们坚持了一般号召和个别指导相结合的方法。强调深入实际、深入群众、深入到生产的最基层，全区由各级党委书记亲自带头，共组织了七万多名干部深入到了生产的第一线——生产队的作业组。因此，今年的农业生产比已往任何一年都抓得早，搞得好。
    领导带头，组织广大干部深入到生产的第一线——作业组，的确是搞好生产的重要措施。有很多干部被群众称为“四员”——既是指挥员，又是战斗员，也是技术员，还是宣传员，说：“四员干部下基层，生产跃进有保证。”
    广大干部指挥生产，参加生产，以生产领导生产的主要方法，是大搞丰产田。粮、油（茶油）、猪是我区农业生产的主要项目。因此，他们普遍的采取了干部、老农、技术员三结合的办法，开展了大搞“水稻丰产田、油茶丰产山、生猪丰产栏（或场）”运动。在运动中每个干部都把自己的水稻丰产田、油茶丰产山、生猪丰产栏作为参加生产、指挥生产的基地，首先把它搞好，事事先行一步，作出榜样，借以总结经验，发现问题。干部的水稻丰产田、油茶丰产山、生猪丰产栏，已成为广大群众生产中的旗帜，深得群众好评。广大群众都称它为“指挥田”、“龙头田”、“榜样田”。干部的丰产田怎样作，群众就跟着怎样作，有力地促进了生产运动步步高涨。
    广大干部在工作中发挥了冲天的干劲，不但苦干、实干，而且充分的注意了巧干，发动群众大搞改良农具和半机械化农具的技术革命运动。现在全区共发明、创造、推广了田间生产工具，运输工具，农副产品加工工具，畜牧饲养工具和食堂炊事工具等各种新式工具多种，大大地减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动效率，推动了生产。在运动中，有不少的干部充当了试验研究、发明创造和推广使用新式工具的带头人。蓝嘉县委第一书记刘大本和该县新圩公社党委书记成良清同志在该社新圩大队下清涵生产队第三作业组和社员一起试验使用插秧机，发现59式插秧机还有缺点——不能插短秧，分秧不均匀，浮蔸多。便马上跟技术员和老农进行现场研究改进。在秧厢下面装上了一个分秧槽，随即与机械厂的工人共同改装了二十七个。经过改装后，不但能插短秧，而且分秧既多又整齐，没有浮蔸。在大搞车子化运动中，公社的六个书记，每人都添置了一件新式工具和一辆车子，在生产中带头使用，在他们的带动下，迅速掀起了群众性的大搞运输车子化运动。不仅推动了生产，而且进一步掀起了全社农业技术革命的新高潮。
