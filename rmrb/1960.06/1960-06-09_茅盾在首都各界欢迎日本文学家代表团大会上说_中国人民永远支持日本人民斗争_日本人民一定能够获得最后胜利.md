Dear Mr. Hiroshi Noma, all representatives of the Japanese literary delegation, comrades, and friends:

Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a grand gathering here to warmly welcome the Japanese literary delegation headed by Mr. Hiroshi Noma to visit our country. We are pleased to see that the Japanese literary and art circles, in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi, stand together with the vigorous, united, and vast ranks of the Japanese people, setting off a surging anti-American patriotic movement. This movement has great world significance, proving that the power of the people is unstoppable. The Chinese people and Chinese writers and artists greatly admire the heroic Japanese people and Japanese writers and artists for their unwavering patriotic and just struggle. In this struggle, you have always stood at the forefront. Now, as cultural envoys of the heroic struggling Japanese people, in order to consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the literary and art circles of China and Japan against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, and at a time when the anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people is flourishing, you have come to visit our country. We express our deep gratitude here.

U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. The Kishi Nobusuke government is precisely a running dog fostered by U.S. imperialism. Recently, this traitorous prime minister, disregarding the firm opposition of the Japanese people and the repeated warnings from China and the Soviet Union, adopted fascist violence and forcibly "passed" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. This alliance treaty, as Chairman Mao Zedong said when he met with Japanese friends last month: "is a military alliance treaty aimed at suppressing the broad masses of the Japanese people, antagonizing China and the Soviet Union, and antagonizing the people of Asia. It is a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world, and will inevitably bring serious disasters to the Japanese people..." This is exactly the case. Kishi Nobusuke's forced "passage" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty further and thoroughly exposed his reactionary nature and accelerated his ambition for militarist expansion. The late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once openly said: "The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is not a charitable undertaking, and certainly not to ensure the security of Japan. It is part of ensuring the security of the United States." Former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Japan, Eichelberger, also said: "As long as we hold on to Japan, we will have industrial potential and manpower in the Far East." These two aggressive American warmongers have bluntly stated the essence of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. What is the essence of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"? It is a Japan-U.S. military alliance that forces the Japanese people to be cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism's war of aggression. This is a great insult to the Japanese people! It will also bring great disasters to the Japanese people! At present, Kishi Nobusuke, this running dog of U.S. imperialism, is acting against the wishes of the Japanese people, trying his best to please his American masters, openly and actively expanding armaments, reviving Japanese militarism, frantically opposing China, participating in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and formulating a second long-term military expansion plan, accelerating nuclear armament. The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet has also formulated a "Southeast Asia Development Plan," which is a plan for Japanese monopoly capitalists to carry out cruel exploitation of the Japanese people on the one hand, and economic expansion into Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa on the other, in accordance with the wishes of U.S. imperialism!

The Japanese people have continuously carried out seventeen united actions to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, lasting for more than a year. From hundreds of thousands of people in the first united action to 20 million people in the sixteenth united action, the momentum has grown stronger and stronger. People from all walks of life in Japan have participated in the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" through strikes, rallies, demonstrations, marches, and other means, making more people aware of the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. military alliance. The Japanese people have gone from shouting slogans against Kishi Nobusuke to slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Yankees go home!" which powerfully demonstrates the increased awareness of the broad masses of the Japanese people! On May 26, the day of the sixteenth united action, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in Japan demonstrated at the U.S. Embassy in Japan. On the same day, 200,000 people surrounded the Japanese Diet, and Kishi Nobusuke was trapped in the Diet building for several hours, and did not sneak home through a side door under the protection of a large number of police until the evening. The Associated Press exclaimed that the large-scale demonstrations of the Japanese people had reached a terrifying level. The Japanese bourgeois newspapers said that the large-scale demonstrations of the Japanese people were shaking the earth like a tsunami. This is indeed a true portrayal. However, the potential of the Japanese people has not yet been fully realized, and even greater battles are yet to come!

After the sixteen united actions, the seventeenth struggle began on May 31. On June 4, 5.6 million Japanese workers, with the full support of people from all walks of life in Japan, held the largest general strike since the war. The main force of this strike was the workers of the state-owned railways. Trains on all lines in Tokyo and trams in the city were completely suspended from the first train. Trains at stations in Osaka, Nagoya, Okayama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Sapporo also stopped on time, just like in Tokyo. Transportation in various places was paralyzed. Local branches of 57 industrial unions belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and 19 industrial unions of the Neutral Trade Union Federation, including telecommunications, postal, steel, coal, hardware, shipbuilding, shipping, chemical, printing, banking, and other workers, also participated in the general strike. Cultural figures, actors, painters, and 20,000 students in Tokyo guarded the routes leading to the major stations, preventing the police from sabotaging and encouraging the workers' struggle; thus, a major victory was achieved in the general strike! These facts fully demonstrate that the united front of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Kishi Nobusuke is becoming increasingly consolidated and expanded.

At present, the Japanese people's struggle is at a great time. As Mr. Hiroshi Noma called in his poem "The Rooster is Crowing": "In this time, we must take back our homeland, take back our grass and bread, take back the forests emitting steam, take back the clouds hanging quietly on the treetops... When the rooster crows at dawn, the people must take back from the reactionaries the rights that belong to the people!" We can further say that the crowing of roosters all over the world is heralding the dawn; from Asia to Africa, to Latin America, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, volcanoes are erupting everywhere; wherever there is imperialist aggression, there is the people's struggle against it. Truly, when the rooster crows, the world turns white, and the days of monsters and demons brandishing their claws will not be too long. With the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, as long as the Japanese people strengthen their unity, make persistent efforts, and fight resolutely, they will surely achieve final victory.

Mr. Hiroshi Noma and the representatives of the delegation, in the struggle for independence, peace, democracy, neutrality, and against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Kishi Nobusuke, hold up the pen like a torch, stand with the masses of the Japanese people, sing the voice of the Japanese people, and sound the battle drum for the Japanese people to advance. The Chinese literary and art circles and the Chinese people resolutely support your struggle with the greatest enthusiasm, and 650 million Chinese people will always resolutely support your struggle for an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan! The important key is to unite all forces that can be united, form a broad united front, and fully recognize the arduousness and long-term nature of the struggle; we believe that the heroic Japanese people will surely strengthen their unity, expand the united front, persist in the struggle, and completely change their fate of being bound to the chariot of U.S. imperialism! On behalf of the Chinese cultural and art circles, I would like to express my heartfelt greetings and high respect to the Japanese literary and art circles and the Japanese people. I wish you more brilliant and greater victories in your struggle! Finally, let me shout:

Smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that enslaves the Japanese people and creates world war by U.S. imperialism!

The people of China and Japan and the people of the world unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism!

Long live world peace!

    茅盾在首都各界欢迎日本文学家代表团大会上说
    中国人民永远支持日本人民斗争  日本人民一定能够获得最后胜利
    亲爱的野间宏先生，日本文学家代表团的全体代表，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人士在这里举行盛大的集会，热烈欢迎以野间宏先生为首的日本文学家代表团前来我国访问。我们高兴地看到，日本文艺界在反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的斗争中，同气势昂扬、步伐一致、队伍壮阔的日本人民站在一起，掀起一个汹涌澎湃的反美爱国运动。这个运动具有伟大的世界意义，它证明人民的力量是不可阻挡的。中国人民和中国文学家艺术家，对英勇的日本人民和日本文学家艺术家坚持不屈的爱国正义斗争非常钦佩。在这一斗争中，你们始终站在最前线。现在，你们作为英勇斗争的日本人民的文化使节，为了巩固和发展中日两国文学艺术界在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的战斗友谊，在日本人民反美爱国正义斗争浪潮蓬勃高涨的时候，特地前来我国访问，我们在这里表示深深的感谢。
    美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人，是全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人。岸信介政府正是美帝国主义豢养的一条走狗。最近这个卖国首相不顾日本人民的坚决反对，不顾中国和苏联的一再警告，采取法西斯暴力，强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约。这个同盟条约正如毛泽东主席在上月接见日本友人时所说的：“是为了压迫日本广大人民，是以中苏为敌、以亚洲人民为敌的侵略性的军事同盟条约，它对亚洲和世界和平是严重的威胁，同时也必将把严重的灾难带来给日本人民。……”事实正是这样。岸信介强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约进一步彻底暴露出它的反动本质和加速军国主义扩张的野心。美国已故国务卿杜勒斯，曾经公开说过：“日美安全条约不是慈善事业，当然不是为了保障日本的安全。这是保障美国安全的一部分。”美国前驻日第八军军长艾奇伯格也说过：“只要我们抓住日本不放，在远东便有工业潜力和人力。”这两个侵略成性的美国好战分子，已经露骨的把日美安全条约的本质，一口说穿了。新日美“安全条约”的本质是什么？就是为了美帝国主义的侵略战争强迫日本人民当炮灰的日美军事同盟，这真是对于日本人民的莫大侮辱！也将给日本人民带来莫大的灾害！目前，岸信介这条美帝国主义走狗就是违背日本人民的愿望，一心想讨好美国主子，公然积极扩充军备，复活日本军国主义，疯狂地敌视中国，参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且制订了第二个长期扩军计划，加紧实行核武装。岸信介内阁还制订了“东南亚开发计划”，这是日本垄断资本家秉承美帝国主义意旨，一方面对日本人民进行残酷剥削，另一方面向东南亚、拉丁美洲和非洲进行经济扩张的计划！
    日本人民为了反对日美军事同盟条约，连续进行了十七次统一行动斗争，时间持续一年多。从第一次统一行动的几十万人发展到第十六次统一行动的二千万人，声势越来越大。日本各阶层人民以罢工、集会、示威、游行等各种方式参加了反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争，使更多的人认识了日美军事同盟的侵略本质。日本人民从高呼反对岸信介的口号，进而为“打倒美帝国主义”、“美国佬滚出去！”的口号，这就有力地显示日本广大民众认识的提高！在第十六次统一行动的5月26日，到美国驻日大使馆示威的日本各阶层的群众就有几万之多。同一天，有二十万人包围了日本国会，岸信介被困在国会大厦里好几小时，直到夜晚才在大批警察保护下从便门溜回家去。美国合众社惊呼日本人民的大示威达到了可怕的程度。日本资产阶级报纸说，日本人民的大示威像海啸一样震撼着大地。这倒是真实的写照。然而日本人民的潜力还没有全部发挥出来，更大的战斗行动还在后边呢！
    十六次统一行动结束后，又从5月31日开始了第十七次的斗争。在6月4日那天，日本五百六十万工人在日本各阶层人民全力支持下，举行了战后规模最大的总罢工。这次罢工主力是国营铁路工人。东京各线路的火车，市内电车从第一班车起，全部停驶。大阪、名古屋、冈山、广岛、长崎、扎幌各车站的火车也和东京一样，准时停驶。各地交通陷于瘫痪状态。属于日本工会总评议会系统的五十七个产业工会和中立工会联合会的十九个产业工会的各地分会，包括电信、邮政、钢铁、煤炭、五金、造船、海运、化学、印刷、银行等职工也纷纷参加总罢工。东京的文化界人士、演员、画家和两万名学生守备通往各个主要车站的路径，阻止警察的破坏，鼓励工人的斗争；就这样取得了总罢工的重大胜利！这些事实充分说明日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的统一战线日益巩固和扩大。
    目前，日本人民的斗争正处于大好时光。正如野间宏先生在“雄鸡正在齐鸣”一诗中所号召的：“要在这时光夺回咱们的国土，夺回咱们的青草和面包，夺回散发着蒸汽的森林，夺回静卦在林梢的云彩……鸡鸣破晓，人民要从反动派的手中夺回属于人民自己的权利！”我们可以进一步说，全世界的鸡声都在报晓；从亚洲到非洲、到拉丁美洲，从太平洋到大西洋，到处都在爆发火山；哪里有帝国主义的侵略，哪里就有人民反抗的斗争。真是雄鸡一唱天下白，魔怪们张牙舞爪的日子不会太长了。在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，日本人民只要加强团结，再接再厉，坚决斗争下去，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    野间宏先生和代表团各位先生们在争取独立和平、民主、中立、反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的斗争中，高举着火把一样的笔锋，和日本人民群众站在一起进行斗争，唱出了日本人民的心声，敲响了日本人民前进的战鼓。中国文艺界和中国人民坚决以最大的热情支持你们的斗争，六亿五千万中国人民永远坚决支持你们为争取独立、民主、和平、中立的日本而进行的斗争！重要关键是团结一切可以团结的力量，结成广泛的统一战线，充分认识到斗争的艰巨性和长期性；我们相信英勇的日本人民一定能够加强团结，扩大统一战线，坚持斗争，彻底地改变自己被缚在美帝国主义战车上的命运！我谨代表中国文化艺术界向日本文艺界和日本人民表示衷心的慰问，并致以崇高的敬意。祝你们在斗争中获得更光辉，更伟大的胜利！最后，让我高呼：
    粉碎美帝国主义奴役日本人民制造世界战争的日美军事同盟条约！
    中日两国人民和全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
