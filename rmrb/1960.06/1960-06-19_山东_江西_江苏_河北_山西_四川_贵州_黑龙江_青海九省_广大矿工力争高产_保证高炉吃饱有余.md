This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 18th: Since entering June, Shandong Province has taken its ore production to a new level. From the 1st to the 12th, the average daily ore output of the province reached more than 41,700 tons, an increase of 13.2% compared with the same period in May. Among them, the 8th, 9th, and 10th of June saw consecutive breakthroughs of more than 50,000 tons per day. This is another unprecedented record after the province's coal, coke, and pig iron successively broke through 100,000 tons, 20,000 tons, and 10,000 tons in daily output.

In order to ensure the completion of the "cultivate for three, surplus for one" requirement put forward by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, and to ensure that the ore production in the three months before the rainy season not only meets the needs of blast furnace smelting but also provides a one-month reserve for the blast furnaces, the iron mines in various places have set off a double high tide of production and technological transformation, rapidly improving the level of mechanization and significantly increasing the level of production. In this double high tide, leading cadres of various mines have gone deep into the front line to solve key problems on the spot.

This newspaper's Nanchang dispatch on the 18th: Jiangxi Province has mobilized the masses to vigorously increase the production of coal and ore to prepare raw materials and fuel for blast furnaces. As of the 10th of this month, the province has stored 150,000 tons of fuel and 340,000 tons of ore, enough for more than a month of iron smelting in the province. The Provincial Party Committee requires that before early July, the province should store two to three months' worth of fuel and ore to ensure the sustained leap forward in steel production in the third quarter.

In order to increase the production of fuel and ore, all localities have seized the favorable opportunity of a relatively slack farming season after early rice transplanting and promptly transferred a batch of labor from the agricultural front to participate in the production and transportation of ore and fuel.

This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 18th: Jiangsu iron ore workers have launched a new high tide of production, and ore output is rising steadily. As of the beginning of June, the province's iron ore production has completed 50% of the state's annual plan.

The Party committees of iron mines in various places have warmly responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call to turn June into a month of substantial high output, striving to complete about half of the state's annual plan in the first half of the year. On the one hand, they have extensively discussed the situation among the broad masses of employees, boosted morale, and carried out technological innovation; on the other hand, they have organized cadres to operate on separate lines, command battles on the front line, and lead and mobilize the masses to vigorously tackle major key points, so that the level of production continues to rise.

This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch on the 18th: Nearly 100,000 iron ore workers in Hebei Province are carrying out a large-scale ore overproduction competition, determined to increase ore production at the fastest speed and seize a substantial and sustained leap forward in steel production.

In order to ensure that ore production keeps up with the needs of steel production, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee has called on iron ore workers throughout the province to seize every second, ensuring that ore production is ahead of steel production. At present, a large-scale overproduction competition throughout the province's iron mines, racing against time, demanding ore from time, and using ore to guarantee iron and steel, is in full swing. Ore production is steadily increasing. In the competition, the Pangjiazhuang and Yantongshan iron mines of the Longyan Iron and Steel Company increased the average daily output of iron ore by 4.83% from June 1st to 12th compared with the first ten days of May.

This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 18th: Shanxi Province's mines are focusing on technological transformation and actively carrying out a "guarantee steel, guarantee iron" ore production increase campaign, so that the province's ore output in the first ten days of June increased by 21% compared with the same period in May. This has allowed steel production enterprises to reserve nearly 50,000 tons of ore, powerfully ensuring that the province's pig iron output in the first ten days of June increased by 1.73% compared with the first ten days of May.

In order to transport the mined ore to the blast furnace in a timely manner, Jinzhong, Jinbei, Jin Southeast and other regions have also mobilized a large number of people to strengthen the construction of soil railways between the mines and iron plants.

This newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 18th: Leading cadres at all levels of the steel front in Sichuan Province have gone deep into the mines to set up camp, focusing on production and transportation, so that the province's daily output and daily transport volume of ore during the current rainy season have maintained the pre-rainy season level, ensuring that the blast furnaces are well-fed.

Since entering May, among the province's twenty-nine key iron-producing counties and eighty-five key iron plants, the county party secretaries of twenty-six counties and the party secretaries or factory directors of seventy-seven factories have all gone up the mountains to set up camp. In the industrial departments and iron mines of these counties, 60% to 70% of the cadres have also gone up the mountains. After the cadres at all levels went up the mountains, they focused on the three major key points of mining, digging, and transporting in the current mines, vigorously carrying out technological transformation, so that production and transportation efficiency have rapidly improved.

This newspaper's Guiyang dispatch on the 18th: Employees of black metallurgical mines in Guizhou Province are innovating mining methods while improving internal transportation capacity, so that the output of metallurgical mines is rising steadily. In May, the province's iron ore overfulfilled the state plan by 2%, an increase of 16.7% compared with the actual output in April; in the first ten days of June, the output was greatly increased compared with the same period in May.

In the mine transformation, cadres from relevant leading organs at all levels went deep into the front line of production and solved problems in production together with the employees. In early June, the Steel Production Command of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee sent a working group to Qingzhen Iron Mine, and in a short period of time, relying on the masses, they formed a line of operation with various mining and eleven transfer tools, reversing the past phenomenon that a large amount of ore could not be transported out. In the first ten days of June, the amount of ore transported out increased by more than 50% compared with the same period in May.

In terms of mining methods, many mines have established regular mining sites, rectified tunnels, promoted medium and small-scale blasting mining, and adopted mechanical stripping, so that production has rapidly improved.

This newspaper's Harbin dispatch on the 18th: Heilongjiang Province adheres to indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on mine technological transformation and mine transportation reform, and continuously increasing the daily output level of ore. May increased by 25% compared with April, and the first ten days of June increased by 54.7% compared with the same period in May.

Nine small and medium-sized mines in Heilongjiang Province have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, increasing the daily output level of ore. At present, iron mines throughout the province are actively realizing one network (transportation forming a network) and six "izations" (railway, cableway, automatic reeling, chute, and loading and unloading vehicle funnelization), accelerating the transportation of ore.

This newspaper's Xining dispatch on the 18th: Major iron ore areas in Qinghai Province are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and ore production has risen significantly. The average daily output of ore in the first ten days of June increased by 58% compared with the average daily output in May, and the grade of ore has also increased.

Leading cadres in various mining areas go deep into the construction sites, take the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and study and solve difficulties with the masses. This is the main reason for the rapid increase in ore production. The persons in charge of these mining areas are good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses. According to the nature of the ore body and the amount of stripping, they have adopted various methods such as large-scale blasting, adit, and open-pit mining, improving the output of ore.
