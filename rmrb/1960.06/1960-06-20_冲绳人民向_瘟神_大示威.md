Okinawa People Stage Massive Demonstration Against "God of Plague"
By People's Daily Commentator

Eisenhower was refused entry by the Japanese people and could only reach Okinawa, the Japanese territory occupied by the United States. But even during his two hours in Okinawa, he couldn't relax. Under the strict guard of more than 15,000 U.S. occupation troops, the people of Okinawa erupted in a massive demonstration of 100,000 people to oppose Eisenhower's "visit," protest U.S. imperialism's occupation of Okinawa, and demand that the U.S. U-2 planes get out. The anger of the Okinawan people frightened Eisenhower, who avoided the demonstrators and slipped out of Okinawa thirty minutes early.

The people of Okinawa have been under American colonial rule, threatened by the 35,000-strong American occupation army. Recently, in coordination with Eisenhower's "visit," the United States held military exercises in Okinawa and prohibited the Okinawan people from holding demonstrations. However, all this could not suppress the Okinawan people's patriotic and just struggle, nor could it stop the Okinawan people's demonstration against Eisenhower. The Okinawan people can no longer tolerate American oppression, and they will never allow their territory to be ravaged. They want to drive American imperialism out of Okinawa.

Eisenhower has repeatedly boasted that the United States "sympathizes" with the "independence" and "freedom" of all countries, and has repeatedly shamelessly said that the United States has not added an acre of land since the end of World War II. However, Okinawa, occupied by U.S. imperialism, is not an acre, but more than 2,000 square kilometers. The U.S. occupying forces seized the land of 50,000 of Okinawa's 70,000 farmers, deprived Okinawan workers of the right to assemble and organize trade unions, and promulgated a "new criminal law" to implement fascist rule over the Okinawan people. This is also the ferocious behavior of colonialists. Even a reporter from the British Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Express" reported from Okinawa: "By occupying Okinawa, the United States has become a colonial country, which is difficult to justify for a country (the United States) that often claims that no country should politically control other countries." Now, the people of Okinawa have exposed Eisenhower's despicable face as a liar in front of the people of the world.

U.S. imperialism has turned Okinawa into a nuclear war base, as one of its largest bases in its strategic system in the Far East. In addition to establishing "Nike-Hercules" missile bases in Okinawa, the United States is also setting up "Mace" and "Hawk" missile bases. Recently, the U.S. Department of the Army announced that in order to implement the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, it has decided to send five atomic division units—2,000 air-transported combat troops—to Okinawa to strengthen "the ability to conduct more flexible counterattacks in the Western Pacific." At the same time, the United States is stationing U-2 planes in Okinawa and is stepping up the training of airborne armed agents to be dropped behind the lines of Asian socialist countries. Eisenhower's visit to Okinawa this time was to strengthen the U.S. military base in Okinawa and carry out deployments for aggressive war.

The Okinawan people's struggle against U.S. occupation of Okinawa and the establishment of nuclear war bases in Okinawa has never stopped. In the summer of 1946, the people of Okinawa launched a 100,000-person anti-American demonstration, and at one time elected People's Party leader Senaga as the mayor of Naha to oppose the U.S. occupation policy. Since last year, the Okinawan people's increasingly high-spirited struggle has forced the U.S. occupation authorities to announce the postponement of the implementation of the "new criminal law," and forced the Ryukyu Legislature to successively pass resolutions demanding that the United States return Okinawa to Japan, condemning the United States for turning Okinawa into a nuclear war base, and opposing the United States' establishment of "Mace" missile bases in Okinawa. The Okinawan people will continue to give increasingly heavy blows to U.S. imperialism's nuclear war plan to invade the Far East.

The Okinawan people's patriotic and just struggle has always been supported by the Japanese people. The Japanese people's anti-Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty struggle is inspiring the Okinawan people to move forward. Now, the Okinawan people's massive demonstration against Eisenhower's "visit" will also inspire the anti-American patriotic struggle of the entire Japanese people.

    冲绳人民向“瘟神”大示威
    本报评论员
    艾森豪威尔被日本人民拒于门外，只能到达美国霸占的日本领土冲绳。但他在冲绳的两小时，也松不了一口气。冲绳人民在美国占领军一万五千多人的严密戒备下爆发了十万人的大示威，反对艾森豪威尔的“访问”，抗议美帝国主义霸占冲绳，要求美国U—2型飞机滚回去。冲绳人民的怒火，吓得艾森豪威尔躲开示威群众，提前三十分钟，溜出了冲绳。
    冲绳人民一直处于美国的殖民统治下，处于美国三万五千名占领军的威胁下。最近美国为配合艾森豪威尔“访问”，在冲绳举行军事演习，并禁止冲绳人民举行示威。然而，这一切都压制不了冲绳人民的爱国正义斗争，阻挡不了冲绳人民对艾森豪威尔的示威。冲绳人民再也不能忍受美国的压迫，决不能容许他们的领土横遭蹂躏，他们要把美帝国主义赶出冲绳。
    艾森豪威尔口口声声吹嘘美国“同情”各国人民的“独立”“自由”，并曾一再厚颜无耻地说什么第二次世界大战结束以后，美国没有增加一亩土地。然而，美帝国主义占领的冲绳，不是一亩，而是两千多平方公里。美国占领军夺走冲绳七万农户中的五万农户的土地，剥夺冲绳工人集会和组织工会的权利，还颁布“新刑法”，对冲绳人民实行法西斯统治，这也是道道地地的殖民主义者的凶恶行径。连英国保守党报纸“每日快报”记者从冲绳发的消息也说：“由于占住了冲绳，美国已经成了一个殖民国家，而对一个经常声称任何国家都不应该在政治上控制其他国家的国家（美国）说来，这实在是难于自圆其说的”。现在冲绳人民在全世界人民面前，揭穿了艾森豪威尔谎言家的卑鄙嘴脸。
    美帝国主义已把冲绳变为核战争基地，作为它在远东的战略体系的一个最大的基地之一。美国除了在冲绳建立了“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹基地以外，还正设立“马斯”式和“隼”式导弹基地。最近美国陆军部宣布，为了执行日美军事同盟条约，决定增派五单位原子师部队——空运战斗部队二千名到冲绳去，加强“在西太平洋进行更加灵活的反击的能力”。同时，美国在冲绳驻扎U—2型飞机，正在加紧训练空投武装特务部队，准备投到亚洲社会主义国家的后方。艾森豪威尔这次到冲绳，就是为了加强美国在冲绳的军事基地，进行侵略战争的部署。
    冲绳人民反对美国霸占冲绳、在冲绳设立核战争基地的斗争，从未停止过。冲绳人民曾在1946年夏天，爆发了十万人的反美示威，一度选举了人民党领袖濑长为那霸市长，反对美国的占领政策。去年以来，冲绳人民日益高涨的斗争，迫使美国占领当局不得不宣布延期实行“新刑法”，迫使琉球立法院先后通过决议，要求美国把冲绳归还日本，谴责美国把冲绳变为核战争基地，反对美国在冲绳设立“马斯”式导弹基地。冲绳人民将再接再厉地给予美帝国主义侵略远东的核战争计划，以日益沉重的打击。
    冲绳人民的爱国正义斗争，一直得到日本人民的支持。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争浪潮，鼓舞着冲绳人民前进。现在，冲绳人民反对艾森豪威尔“访问”的大示威，也将激励整个日本人民的反美爱国斗争。
