Summer oil crops must be planted extensively and well
By our commentator

Seizing the current summer planting season and planting as many oil crops as possible is the key to ensuring the completion of this year's oil production plan.

Due to severe spring droughts in some areas, insufficient oilseed in some areas, and low seed germination rates, this year's spring-sown oil crop planting plan has not been fully completed; the phenomenon of missing seedlings in the already-sown peanut fields is also quite serious. We should pay attention to these situations.

To complete the annual oil production plan, we should step up our efforts in two aspects. On the one hand, we should do everything possible to strengthen the field management of the already-sown oil crops. For peanut fields with missing seedlings, we should immediately replant as long as it is possible; if it is not possible to replant peanuts, we should replant sesame or other oil crops. On the other hand, we should plant as many summer-sown oil crops as possible. The so-called planting as much as possible means expanding the planting area of summer soybeans, summer peanuts, summer sesame, and other oil crops as much as possible beyond the original summer planting plan, using the expansion of summer-sown oil crops to ensure the completion of the annual oil crop planting plan.

It is now the peak of summer planting, and all localities should seize this favorable opportunity to plant summer oil crops extensively and intensively. There are many ways to expand the planting area of summer-sown oil crops: "using oil to compensate for oil" is one way, and "intercropping" is also a way. In areas where spring peanuts and spring sesame have been planted less, summer peanuts and summer sesame can be planted more. As for intercropping, it is an even better method. According to the experience of Henan, Hebei, and other places, intercropping sesame and sweet potatoes does not affect sweet potato production and yields extra sesame. Last year, Yan Gezhuang in Leting County, Hebei Province, intercropped sesame in 300 mu of sweet potato fields, and the sweet potato harvest was not reduced, with an additional 30 jin of sesame harvested per mu. This year, Yibin Prefecture in Sichuan Province is also promoting the experience of intercropping sesame in peanut, sweet potato, and bean fields, and intercropping peanuts in cornfields. Planting sunflowers, sesame, and other small oil crops extensively by utilizing the edges of fields, corners, and newly reclaimed land is also a universally achievable good method for increasing oil production. The suburban communes of Zigong City in Sichuan Province have adopted a combination of large-scale block planting and scattered planting along field edges and corners, which has more than doubled the peanut planting area in the entire suburbs compared to last year. There are many ways to develop oil production. As long as the leadership strongly advocates and actively arranges, every county and people's commune can expand the planting area of oil crops.

While arranging grain and cotton production, Party committees at all levels should also seriously arrange oil production and effectively strengthen leadership. Leading cadres of counties and communes should not only plant experimental fields of grain and cotton but also plant experimental fields of oil crops. By planting experimental fields, advanced experiences should be summarized and promoted in a timely manner, high-yield oil crop models should be cultivated, and large-scale high-yield oil production should be promoted.

The summer planting season is very short, and the summer planting of oil crops should be grasped and carried out as soon as possible. Leading cadres at all levels should go deep into production teams and fields to help solve specific difficulties in summer planting. For communes and production teams where the summer planting area has not been fully implemented, they should be helped to arrange the area and expand the area as much as possible. For units lacking oil crop seeds, they should be helped to tap the potential of seeds, organize seed exchange, and adopt methods such as germination and sowing to save seeds to solve the problem. As long as we effectively do such specific organizational work, it is fully guaranteed that we can overfulfill the summer planting plan for oil crops.

    夏油料一定要多种种好
    本报评论员
    抓紧当前的夏种季节，尽量多种油料作物，是保证完成今年油料生产计划的关键。
    由于有些地方春旱严重，有的地方油料种籽不足、种籽发芽率低等原因，今年的春播油料作物播种计划没有全部完成；已播的花生缺苗现象也比较严重。这些情况应当引起我们的注意。
    完成全年油料生产计划应当从两个方面加紧努力，一方面，千方百计地加强已经播种的油料作物的田间管理，对于缺苗的花生田，只要还能补种的，要立即补种；不能补种花生的，就补种芝麻或其他油料作物。另一方面，就是要尽量多种一些夏播油料作物。所谓多种，就是在原定夏播计划之外，尽一切可能扩大夏大豆、夏花生、夏芝麻和其他油料作物的种植面积，用扩大夏播油料作物的办法，来保证全年油料播种计划的完成。
    目前正是夏播盛期，各地应该紧紧地抓住这个有利时机，狠种大种夏油料。扩大夏播油料作物播种面积，可以采取多种多样的办法：“以油补油”是一个办法，“间作套种”也是一个办法。春花生春芝麻种少了的地方，可以多种夏花生夏芝麻，至于套种间作更是一个好办法，根据河南、河北等地的经验，芝麻和甘薯间作，既不影响甘薯产量，又额外多得了芝麻。河北省乐亭县阎各庄去年在三百亩甘薯地间种芝麻，甘薯没少收，每亩还多收了三十斤芝麻。四川宜宾专区今年也在推广花生、红薯、豆子地里间种芝麻、玉米地里间种花生的经验。见缝插针，利用地边、地角和新开荒地大种向日葵、芝麻和其他小油料，也是普遍可以做到的增产油料的好办法。四川省自贡市郊区各公社采取大面积成片种植和田边地角零星种植相结合的办法，使全郊区的花生种植面积比去年扩大了一倍多。发展油料生产的办法是很多的，只要领导上大力倡导，积极安排，每个县和人民公社都可以扩大油料作物的种植面积。
    各级党委在布置粮、棉生产的同时，对于油料生产也要认真加以安排，切实加强领导。县和公社的领导干部不但要种粮食和棉花的试验田，也要种油料作物的试验田。通过种试验田，及时总结和推广先进经验，培养油料高产典型，推动大面积油料高产。
    夏播季节很短促，油料作物的夏播工作应当赶快抓紧进行。各级领导干部应当深入生产队，深入田间，帮助解决夏播中的具体困难；对于夏播面积没有完全落实的公社、生产队，应当帮助他们安排好面积，尽一切可能扩大面积；对于缺少油料作物种籽的单位，则应当帮助他们挖掘种籽潜力，组织种籽调换，采取催芽播种、节省种籽的办法加以解决。只要我们切实做好这样的具体的组织工作，超额完成油料作物夏播计划是完全有保证的。
