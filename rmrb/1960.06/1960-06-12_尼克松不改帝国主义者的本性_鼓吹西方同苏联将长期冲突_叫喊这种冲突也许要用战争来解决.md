Xinhua News Agency, 11th, New York Dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon, at a rally in New York yesterday, advocated a long-term "conflict" between the West and the Soviet Union.

Speaking at a luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel attended by two thousand people, Nixon, referring to the situation after the collapse of the Paris Four-Power Summit, said that the "conflict" between the West and the Soviet Union may not be resolved for fifty years. He said, "The conflict we are involved in will not be resolved in two or five years, or in a generation, or even fifty years."

On the one hand, Nixon said that the West would use "non-military" means in this conflict, while pointing out that this conflict may have to be "resolved by war."

Nixon advocated that the West must have "endurance" in carrying out this conflict, and must "pay the price and, if necessary, give their lives for it."

    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：美国副总统尼克松昨天在纽约的一次集会上，鼓吹西方同苏联间的“冲突”将长期进行。
    尼克松在阿道夫—亚斯多里亚饭店一次有两千人参加的午宴上，谈到巴黎四国政府首脑会议垮台后的局势时说，西方同苏联间的“冲突”可能在五十年内都不能解决。他说，“我们所参与的冲突不会在两年或五年内、或者在一个世代以至五十年内得到解决”。
    尼克松一方面说西方在这场冲突中将使用“非军事方面”的手段，同时指出，这场冲突也许要“用战争来解决”。
    尼克松鼓吹西方在进行这种冲突时必须有“持久力”，必须“付出代价和在必要时为之付出生命”。
