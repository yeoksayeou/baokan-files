    A Good Film Depicting the Combat History of Our People
    Jin Xinshu
    The film "Jin Yu Ji" realistically and vividly brings to the screen a page from the arduous struggle of the Anti-Japanese United Army in the Yanbian area of Northeast China. This is of great educational significance to the younger generation who have grown up in a peaceful environment, and it is something to be happy about. This film also evoked my memories of past struggles, especially of comrades who fought together in the past and sacrificed heroically. The film took me back to that harsh combat life for a long time, making it impossible for me to calm down. Some scenes from the film appeared in my mind for a while, and then scenes from our struggle at that time appeared one after another. Even when I fell asleep, I dreamed of these things...
    When Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, the Korean people in Yanbian lived a life worse than that of beasts of burden, but this also promoted the vigorous development of the anti-Japanese struggle. The anti-Japanese struggle of the Korean people in the Yanbian area was carried out entirely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in unity with the Han comrades. At that time, the Han comrades told us: You have many difficulties in carrying out revolutionary activities in Korean clothing. It is best for each of you to prepare a set of Han clothing. If there is a situation, change into it immediately, which will be convenient for concealment. When I saw some scenes in "Jin Yu Ji" where Jin Yu Ji was secretly working in Han clothing, I felt that the film was very realistic in these places and paid attention to the characteristics of the struggle at that time. At that time, Comrade Yang Jingyu once told us: We are doing revolution not for ourselves, but for the liberation of the nation and class; we must grasp the destiny of our nation and class in our own hands, and we must not let imperialism and reactionaries control the destiny of the nation and class. The film "Jin Yu Ji" vividly portrays the history of the Han and Korean people in the Northeast region uniting around the Party and fighting for the destiny of their own nation and class. The film realistically shows the arduousness of the struggle at that time and the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses. Cui Xianglong's heroic sacrifice to cover the retreat of his comrades, Little Li Zi's mother's life-saving rescue of Jin Yu Ji, and Jin Yu Ji's overall consideration and strong revolutionary fighting will to contribute everything to the revolution left a deep impression on me.
    This film also well demonstrates national unity. The Korean and Han people in Northeast China are as united and friendly as brothers. In the past, under the leadership of the Party, we established a flesh-and-blood combat friendship in the long-term and arduous struggle against Japanese aggressors and won the victory of the anti-Japanese struggle. It should be seen that the Han and Korean working people will always be class brothers. We should unite more closely under the leadership of the Party to achieve greater victories in the struggle to build socialism. The film "Jin Yu Ji" is a vivid teaching material in demonstrating national unity. It very simply and profoundly depicts the close combat friendship between Korean and Han soldiers within the Anti-Japanese United Army, and also expresses the family-like and life-and-death class feelings between the Korean and Han masses.
    In general, "Jin Yu Ji" is a film with great educational significance. Watching such a film can inspire our fighting spirit and strengthen our confidence. We must learn from Jin Yu Ji's revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice or difficulties for the sake of revolutionary interests, setting high goals, establishing lofty ambitions, more consciously relying on the leadership of the Party, always maintaining the most vigorous and strong revolutionary will, continuing the revolution, constantly revolutionizing, and continuously building our country into a more beautiful and stronger socialist country, so that the ideals of communism can be realized, which is the complete liberation of the nation and class. This is the common aspiration of all ethnic groups living in the era of Mao Zedong and living in the big family of our great motherland. I hope that film workers will make more good films in the future that reflect the combat history and national unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

    一部表现我国人民战斗历史的好影片
    金信淑
    电影《金玉姬》把东北延边地区抗日联军的艰苦斗争的一页，很真实很生动地搬上了银幕，这对在和平环境下长大的年轻一代有着极大的教育意义，这是一件值得高兴的事。这部影片也引起了我对过去的斗争、特别是过去在一起斗争而英勇牺牲的同志们的回忆。影片把我带回那严酷的战斗生活中去，很久，使我不能平静，在我脑海中一会儿出现了影片中的某些镜头，一会儿又出现了我们当时斗争的一幕一幕情景，即使睡着了，梦见的也是这些……
    在日本帝国主义侵占东北的时候，延边的朝鲜族的人民过着牛马不如的生活，但是这也促进了抗日斗争的蓬勃发展。延边地区朝鲜族的抗日斗争，完全是在中国共产党的领导下和汉族同志团结在一起进行的。当时汉族同志对我们说：你们穿朝鲜族服装进行革命活动，有很多困难的地方，你们最好每人准备一套汉族的服装，要有情况，马上便换上，这样便于隐蔽。当我看到《金玉姬》中的一些镜头：金玉姬穿着汉族的服装秘密进行工作时，觉得影片在这些地方表现得很真实，很注意当时斗争的特点。当时，杨靖宇同志曾对我们讲过：我们干革命，不是为了个人，而是为了民族和阶级的解放；我们一定要把自己的民族和阶级的命运掌握在自己的手里，不能把民族和阶级的命运让帝国主义和反动派掌握。电影《金玉姬》很形象地表现了东北地区汉族和朝鲜族人民团结在党的周围、为自己民族和阶级的命运而战斗的历史。影片真实地表现了当时斗争的艰苦和共产党员、革命群众的不屈不挠的革命精神。像崔相龙为了掩护同志们撤退而英勇牺牲、小李子妈舍命救金玉姬，以及金玉姬那种顾全大局、为革命贡献出一切的旺盛的革命斗争意志，给我留下了很深的印象。
    这部影片也很好地表现了民族团结。东北的朝鲜族和汉族是如兄如弟一般的团结和友爱。过去我们一道在党的领导下在长期的反抗日本侵略者的残酷斗争中，建立了血肉相连的战斗友谊，取得了抗日斗争的胜利。应该看到汉族劳动人民和朝鲜族劳动人民永远都是阶级弟兄，应该更紧密地在党的领导下团结起来，才能在建设社会主义的斗争中取得更大的胜利。电影《金玉姬》在表现民族团结方面是一个生动的教材。它非常朴实和深刻地描写了在抗日联军内部朝鲜族战士同汉族战士之间的亲密的战斗友谊，也表现了朝鲜族群众和汉族群众之间的亲如一家人、同生共死的阶级感情。
    总起来说，《金玉姬》是一部有着极大教育意义的影片。看了这样的影片，可以鼓舞我们的斗志，增强我们的信心。我们要学习金玉姬那种为了革命利益不怕牺牲、不怕困难的革命精神，立大志，树雄心，更自觉地依靠党的领导，永远保持着最旺盛最强烈的革命意志，继续革命，不断革命，一直把我们国家建设成一个更美好更强大的社会主义国家，使共产主义的理想得到实现，才是民族和阶级的彻底解放。这是生活在毛泽东时代、生活在我们伟大祖国大家庭中的各个民族的共同愿望。我希望今后电影工作者多拍一些这样表现中国各族人民的战斗历史和民族团结的好影片。
