Xinhua News Agency, 18th June, Taipei: Eisenhower touched upon the Quemoy and Matsu issues in his first meeting with Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon. It was revealed that Eisenhower assured in the talks that the US attitude towards Quemoy and Matsu "has not changed in the slightest."

The previously announced US attitude is: if an attack on Quemoy and Matsu endangers the security of Taiwan itself, the US will intervene to "defend" these islands.

This further shows the aggressive nature of Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan and the conspiracy to deliberately create tensions in the Far East.

According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty, the two discussed the anti-American armed demonstrations by the Chinese People's Liberation Army's shelling of Quemoy, as well as the world situation, especially studying the so-called "Communist threat."

Hagerty also announced that Eisenhower had ordered US Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II to meet him in Okinawa tomorrow and travel to South Korea together. Sources say the two will discuss the situation in Japan and plan new conspiracies to interfere in the massive anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle of the Japanese people.

Hagerty said that Eisenhower is still awaiting reports on the worldwide reaction to the cancellation of his visit to Japan. Hagerty said that Eisenhower had seen reports of several newspaper editorials, but he still cannot estimate the impact of this event on world opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th June, Taipei: Eisenhower, the common enemy of the Asian people, gave a speech at a "mass" rally in Taipei this afternoon, clamoring that the United States would never weaken its military "defenses," indicating that the United States insists on pursuing its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people while peddling the stench of false peace.

In his speech, Eisenhower viciously attacked the new China as so-called "belligerent and despotic." He clamored, "The United States does not recognize the right of the belligerent and despotic Communist regime in Peiping to speak for all the Chinese people."

He also rehashed his old tune, saying that the United States only supports the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the United Nations, "considering it the only legitimate representative of China in that organization." Eisenhower wantonly slandered China's people's communes. He said that the Chinese people enslaved by the United States in Taiwan "stand in stark contrast to the brutal forced organization of their compatriots on the mainland," and he also smeared our country's commune system as "soul-destroying labor teams."

Eisenhower traveled across the ocean to the Far East to promote US aggression and create tensions in the region. However, in his speech, he once again peddled his false peace conspiracy, saying that the United States will "seek effective ways to ban war and promote the rule of law internationally," "regardless of any setbacks." The United States "seeks to resolve outstanding issues through peaceful means."

However, Eisenhower immediately said that this does not indicate "any weakening of the determination" of the United States to pursue its aggressive policies. He stated that the United States will not "yield to threats or weaken its defenses against potential aggressors" because doing so would "not be conducive" to achieving US goals.

This common enemy of the Asian people—the head of the US aggressors—tried his best to portray the United States as a "friend and neighbor" with "shared interests" with "Pacific countries," saying "the security and happiness of the United States are closely linked to their security and happiness." Ignoring the countless facts of US aggression, expansion, enslavement, and oppression of countries in the Pacific region, he shamelessly said, "We respect their sovereignty as we respect our own," and the United States "has not sought to impose our own way of life or system of government on them."

Eisenhower also boasted about the "achievements" of Taiwan's economic "development" under the so-called "aid" of the United States, ignoring the fact that the people of Taiwan are living in misery under US plunder. He said with ulterior motives that Taiwan "provides a shining example" for "new nations in Asia and Africa."

### 艾森豪威尔和蒋介石会谈表明  美国侵略者蓄意制造紧张局势

    艾森豪威尔和蒋介石会谈表明
    美国侵略者蓄意制造紧张局势
    新华社18日讯　台北消息：艾森豪威尔在今天下午同蒋介石举行的第一次会谈中接触了金门和马祖的问题。据透露，艾森豪威尔在会谈中保证，美国对金门和马祖的态度“丝毫没有改变”。
    早先宣布过的美国的态度是：如果对金门和马祖的进攻危及台湾本身的安全的话，美国要插手“保卫”这些岛屿。
    这就进一步表明了，艾森豪威尔这次访问台湾所具有的侵略性质以及蓄意制造远东紧张局势的阴谋。
    据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂宣布，他们二人讨论了中国人民解放军炮击金门的反美武装示威，还讨论了世界局势，尤其是研究了所谓“共产党威胁”的问题。
    哈格蒂同时还宣布，艾森豪威尔已经命令美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二在明天到冲绳和他会见并且一道前往南朝鲜。有消息说，他们二人将要讨论日本局势，策划干预日本人民声势浩大的反美反岸斗争的新阴谋。
    哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔仍然在等待关于全世界对取消访问日本的反应的报告。哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔看到了关于几家报纸社论的报告，可是他还无法估计这件事对世界舆论的影响。
    新华社18日讯　台北消息：亚洲人民的公敌艾森豪威尔今天下午在台北的一次“群众”集会上讲话，叫嚣美国决不削弱军事“防务”，表明美国坚持推行它敌视中国人民的政策，同时又贩卖假和平的臭货色。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里恶毒地攻击新中国为所谓“好战的和专制的”。他叫嚷，“美国不承认好战的和专制的北平共产党政权代表全体中国人民讲话的权利。”
    他还重弹他的那套滥调说，美国在联合国组织里只支持蒋介石分子，“认为它是中国在该组织中唯一合法的代表”。艾森豪威尔肆意诋毁中国的人民公社。他说什么在台湾受着美国奴役的中国人民同他们“在大陆上的同胞所受到的野蛮的强行组织化形成鲜明对照”，他还污蔑我国的公社制度是“毁灭灵魂的劳动队”。
    艾森豪威尔远涉重洋，前来远东地区推行美国的侵略政策，在这个地区制造紧张局势。可是，他在演说里却再一次贩卖他的假和平的阴谋，说什么美国将“不顾一切挫折”，“寻求有效的方法禁止战争和促进国际间的法治”。美国“寻求用和平的方法解决悬而未决的问题”。
    然而，艾森豪威尔紧接着说，这并不表明美国推行其侵略政策的“决心有任何削弱”。他表明，美国不会“向威胁屈服或者削弱对付潜在的侵略者的防务”，因为如果这样作，对实现美国的目标“没有好处”。
    这个亚洲人民的公敌——美国侵略者头子竭力把美国说成是与“太平洋国家”“有着共同利害关系的朋友和邻居”，“美国的安全和幸福同它们的安全和幸福紧密地联系在一起”。他不顾美国对太平洋地区国家进行侵略扩张的和奴役压迫的无数事实，却厚颜无耻地说“我们像尊重自己的主权一样尊重它们的主权”，美国“并未设法把我们自己的生活方式或政府制度强加在它们身上”。
    艾森豪威尔还不顾在美国掠夺下台湾人民民不聊生的事实，吹嘘在美国的所谓“援助”下台湾经济“发展”的“成就”。他用心不善地说台湾为“亚洲和非洲的新国家”“提供了一个光辉的榜样”。
