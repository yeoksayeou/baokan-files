Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Washington: Eisenhower's forced postponement of his "visit" to Japan under the strong opposition of the Japanese people has caused confusion and frustration in the American ruling group.

All evening newspapers in Washington and New York yesterday and all morning newspapers today reported the news with banner headlines. Radio and television stations lamented the great failure of the United States from morning till night.

On the one hand, the American propaganda machine sadly admitted that this made the United States lose face and run into snags in front of the whole world once again. On the other hand, it ferociously clamored for intensifying the suppression of the Japanese people.

The "New York Times" editorial today admitted that Eisenhower's postponement of his "visit" to Japan caused the United States a "sharp political, spiritual and propaganda failure." This newspaper clamored for adhering to the aggressive American policy in the Far East, yelling "No matter how the domestic situation in Japan develops, it is necessary to take necessary measures to ensure the security of ourselves and our friends."

Associated Press reporter Hightower pointed out that the failure of Eisenhower's visit to Japan was the "second failure" suffered by the United States in a month after the Four-Power Summit, a "shameful and costly failure." Hightower worried that this "very unfortunate incident" would not only "threaten the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance," but might also "endanger" the U.S. military system in the Far East. He trumpeted that due to Japan's "strategic position and industrial wealth," the United States is determined to "protect" Japan through military treaties in the future in order to "continue to maintain its own air and naval bases there."

The Washington "Star Evening News" wrote in an editorial to excuse the great failure of the United States: "The decision to postpone and probably cancel President Eisenhower's visit to Tokyo is rational and necessary. Because the President's visit to the Japanese capital would inevitably risk serious physical injury, and under the current circumstances, Eisenhower's visit would strengthen the political position of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, which is very doubtful."

This newspaper sadly admitted that the victory achieved by the Japanese people was "a serious blow to the position of the United States in the Far East." It gnashed its teeth and wrote: Now people can only hope that "Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi can continue to hold office, and hope that his determination to finalize the U.S.-Japan defense treaty will not be forced to give in." The "Star Evening News" also put pressure on the Kishi Nobusuke government to carry out more brutal suppression of the Japanese people. It was still very dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government, which caused the June 15th massacre, and even complained that it "was neither capable nor willing to suppress the mobs."

The New York "World Telegram" admitted in an editorial that the Japanese people's struggle against the United States and Nobusuke Kishi has "won a major battle." This newspaper worriedly pointed out that this incident "is only a sign of a deeper crisis facing Japan."

The U.S. Senators who originally planned to pass the U.S.-Japan military treaty yesterday issued a cry of frustration after receiving the news. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright believed that this "caused the United States' prestige and dignity to be lost in the eyes of the world," once again proving the United States' "lack of foresight and stupidity" in decision-making. Senate Republican Leader Dirksen said that Eisenhower's reluctance to "visit" Japan was "extremely unfortunate." However, indications show that despite these failures, the U.S. government is determined to continue to support Nobusuke Kishi in forcibly passing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. U.S. State Department officials held a meeting with Senate leaders yesterday, advising them to "take action on the security treaty as planned" regardless of how the situation develops. Senate Leader Johnson and others told reporters after the meeting that the Senate would take action as soon as possible.

    艾森豪威尔延期访日的消息震动了华盛顿
    美报哀号美国远东政策遭到严重失败
    政界人士感到沮丧但仍表示要支持岸信介强行通过日美条约
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔在日本人民强烈反对之下被迫推迟他对日本的“访问”的消息，在美国统治集团中引起混乱和沮丧。
    华盛顿和纽约昨天所有的晚报和今天所有的晨报都以通栏大标题报道了这个消息，广播电台和电视台从早到晚都在为美国的这次大失败而哀号。
    美国的宣传机器一方面悲哀地承认这使美国又一次在全世界面前丢脸和碰壁，另一方面凶恶地鼓吹加紧对日本人民进行镇压。
      “纽约时报”今天的社论承认，艾森豪威尔推迟对日本的“访问”使美国遭到了一次“尖锐的政治上、精神上和宣传上的失败”。这家报纸叫喊要坚持美国在远东的侵略政策，叫嚷“不管日本国内局势如何发展，要采取必要的措施来保证我们自己和我们的朋友的安全”。
    美联社记者海托华指出，艾森豪威尔访日之行的告吹是继四国首脑会议之后在一个月的时间里美国遭到的“第二次失败”，是一次“丢脸的和代价重大的失败”。海托华担心这个“非常不幸的事件”不仅将“使美日联盟前途受到威胁”，而且可能会因而使美国在远东的军事体系“受到危害”。他鼓吹由于日本的“战略地位和工业财富”，美国决心要在今后通过军事条约来“保护”日本，以“继续保持它自己在那里的空海军基地”。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”在一篇社论中为美国的这次大失败解嘲说：“让艾森豪威尔总统延期而且大概是撤销对东京的访问的这一决定，是理智的和必需的。因为总统到日本首都去必然要冒身体受伤的严重危险，而且在目前情况下艾森豪威尔的访问会加强日本岸信介首相的政治地位，这一点是非常值得怀疑的。
    这家报纸悲哀地承认，日本人民所取得的这一胜利是对美国“在远东的地位是一个严重的打击”。它咬牙切齿地写道：现在人们只能希望，“岸信介首相能够继续执政，而且希望他的要使日美防御条约得到最后批准的决心不会被迫屈服。”“明星晚报”还向岸信介政府施加压力，要它对日本人民进行更残暴的镇压。它对造成六·一五血案的岸信介政府还很不满意，竟然抱怨它“既没有能力也不愿镇压暴民”。
    纽约“世界电讯报”在社论中承认，日本人民反对美国和岸信介的斗争已经“赢得了一场主要的战斗”。这家报纸忧虑地指出，这次 事件“只不过是日本所面临的一个更深的危机的征兆”。
    本来打算在昨天通过美日军事条约的美国参议员们，在得到这个消息后发出一片沮丧的叫喊。参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特认为这“使美国的威望和尊严在世界心目中遭到损失”，再次证明美国在决策方面“缺乏远见和愚蠢”。参议院共和党领袖德克森说，艾森豪威尔不敢到日本去“访问”是“极端不幸的”。但是迹象表明，美国政府不顾它所遭到这些失败，决心继续支持岸信介强行通过日美军事同盟条约。美国国务院的官员们昨天同参议院领袖举行了会议，建议他们不管局势发展如何应“按原定计划对安全条约采取行动”。参议院领袖约翰逊等人会后告诉记者们说，参议院将尽早采取行动。
