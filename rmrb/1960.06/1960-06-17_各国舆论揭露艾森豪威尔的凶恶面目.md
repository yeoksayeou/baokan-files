Xinhua News Agency report: International opinion continues to expose Eisenhower's conspiracy to create tension in the Far East and step up arms expansion and war preparations.

    Soviet "Gudok" says
    Eisenhower Intensifies "Aid" to Southeast Asian Puppets
    The Soviet newspaper "Gudok" published an article on the 15th stating that Eisenhower's Far East trip with malicious intent proves that the American "Cold War" group is still strengthening its activities. However, the forces of people in all countries to defend peace are strong, and they can give any aggressor a taste of bitterness.
    "Gudok" said in its article entitled "A Malicious Visit" that Washington touts Eisenhower's visit as "a manifestation of friendship," but in reality, as the Chinese "People's Daily" pointed out: "Eisenhower's primary task in his Far East trip is to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the people of various countries, and protect his lackeys in order to continue to use them as tools for the United States to enslave the people of various countries and maintain its entire aggressive front in Asia, so as not to collapse across the board."
    The article continued that it seems that Washington has not learned its lesson in Cuba, South Korea, and Turkey. The article stated that the United States will continue to strengthen military assistance to the puppet regimes in Southeast Asia and make militaristic preparations in this region, and the purpose of Eisenhower's visit is to strengthen these preparations. The article emphasized that the American propaganda machine calls the American policy of aggression against Southeast Asia a manifestation of "friendship," but it is difficult to deceive the people of Asia, and they can see the malicious intentions of Eisenhower's visit.

    Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" says
    Eisenhower Arrives in the Far East to Plot Anti-China and Anti-Soviet Conspiracies
    The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary on the 14th stating that the purpose of U.S. President Eisenhower's Far East trip is to organize conspiracies against the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. He went to Japan to prevent the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke government and attempted to exert pressure so that Japan would finally ratify the new U.S.-Japan military treaty.
    The newspaper said that the U.S. "peace-loving" mask was torn off after the U.S. spy plane intrusion into the Soviet Union was exposed, revealing the heinous face of the imperialists.
    "Rabotnichesko Delo" said that the entire adventurous policy of the war-mongers will inevitably meet with a shameful failure. History has already prepared straitjackets for these madmen.
    The Bulgarian "Narodna Armiya" said that it is already clear that the most hated "guest" of the Japanese people at present is Eisenhower. His Far East trip is precisely to consolidate the unpopular regimes and treaties in the places he is visiting.

    Czechoslovak "Pravda" says
    Eisenhower Arrives in the Far East to Inspect the Combat Readiness of U.S. Troops
    The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rude Pravo" pointed out in an article entitled "Dangerous Trip" on the 14th that Washington is trying to strengthen the shaky Kishi Nobusuke government to prevent losing its main "ally" in the Pacific. The article asked, what reasons forced the stage managers in Washington to decide to send the President on stage at such a time? The answer is: the true desperate situation of the aggressors forces Eisenhower to do everything possible to keep the aggressive treaty alive.
    "Slovak Pravda" said on the 14th that the purpose of Eisenhower's Far East trip is to "inspect" the combat readiness of troops stationed in the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan and other places.
    The newspaper said that after the heroic struggles launched by the people of South Korea and Japan, no one doubts that the situation of the United States in this region is like standing on a volcano.

    Australian "Tribune" says
    Eisenhower Ignites Flames of Anger Everywhere
    The Australian Communist Party newspaper "Tribune" said on the 15th that Eisenhower is sinking into a sea of anger. It said that Eisenhower is igniting flames of anger everywhere, "He cannot use rhetoric to disguise himself as a friendly envoy."
    The "Tribune" weekly pointed out that Eisenhower's "visit" is nothing more than an attempt by the imperialists to show their strength.

    Norwegian "Friheten" says
    The Ground Under the Feet of U.S. Imperialism is Burning
    The Norwegian Communist Party's organ "Friheten" published an editorial on the 14th on Eisenhower's visit to Japan, saying that Eisenhower will see the Japanese people angrily opposing the U.S.-Japan military treaty from behind bulletproof glass.
    The editorial pointed out that the conspiracy of the U.S. government and the Japanese reactionaries to impose the U.S.-Japan military treaty on the Japanese people has ignited the anger of the Japanese people. The Japanese people are constantly opposing this military treaty with resolute struggles, and more and more people are involved in this struggle.
    The editorial said that the Japanese people's struggle has made the Kishi Nobusuke government totter. The ground under the feet of U.S. imperialism is burning.

    各国舆论揭露艾森豪威尔的凶恶面目
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续揭露艾森豪威尔到远东制造紧张局势和加紧扩军备战的阴谋活动。
    苏联“汽笛报”说
    艾森豪威尔加紧“援助”东南亚傀儡
    苏联“汽笛报”15日发表文章说，艾森豪威尔的怀抱着凶恶目的的远东之行证明了美国“冷战”集团还在加强活动。但是，各国人民保卫和平的力量是强大的，他们能给任何侵略者尝到苦头。
    “汽笛报”在这篇题为“恶意的访问”的文章中说，华盛顿把艾森豪威尔的访问标榜为“友谊的表现”，实际上正如中国“人民日报”所指出的：“艾森豪威尔远东之行的首要任务，就是横蛮干涉各国的内政，压制各国人民的爱国正义斗争，庇护他的走狗，以继续利用它们作为美国奴役各国人民的工具，维护它在亚洲整个的侵略阵线，而不致全线崩溃。”
    文章接着说，看来，华盛顿并没有吸取在古巴、南朝鲜和土耳其的教训。文章说，美国还要继续加强对东南亚傀儡政权的军事援助，并在这一地区作军国主义的准备，艾森豪威尔访问的目的就是为了加强这一准备。文章强调说，美国宣传机关把美国对东南亚的侵略政策称作“友谊”的表现，然而亚洲的人民是很难受骗的，他们能看清艾森豪威尔访问的凶恶意图。
    保加利亚“劳动报”说
    艾森豪威尔到远东策划反华反苏阴谋
    保加利亚“劳动报”14日发表评论说，美国总统艾森豪威尔远东之行的目的，是组织反对中华人民共和国和苏联的阴谋活动。他到日本去是为了防止岸信介政府的崩溃，并企图施加压力，以便使日本最后批准美日新军事条约。
    这家报纸说，美国“爱好和平”的假面具在美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联事件被揭穿以后，就露出了帝国主义者凶恶的面目。
    “劳动报”说，战争煽动者的整个冒险政策必将遭到可耻的失败。历史已经为他们准备好了疯子穿的紧身衣。
    保加利亚“人民军报”说，已经很明显，目前，日本人民最憎恨的“客人”就是艾森豪威尔。他的远东之行正是为了巩固他所要访问的地方的不得人心的政权和条约。
    捷“斯洛伐克真理报”说
    艾森豪威尔到远东视察美军战斗准备
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”14日在一篇题为“危险的旅行”的文章中指出，华盛顿企图加强摇摇欲坠的岸信介政府，防止失去它在太平洋的主要“盟国”。文章问道，是什么原因迫使华盛顿的舞台监督决定在这样的时机派总统出台呢？回答是：侵略者的真正的绝望处境迫使艾森豪威尔不惜一切代价来使侵略条约苟延残喘。
    “斯洛伐克真理报”14日说，就艾森豪威尔的远东之行的目的是“视察”驻在菲律宾、台湾、日本等地的军队的战斗准备。
    这家报纸说，在南朝鲜和日本人民开展了英勇的斗争以后，再也没有人对美国在这个地区的处境犹如站在火山上这一点发生怀疑了。
    澳大利亚“论坛报”说
    艾森豪威尔到处激起愤怒火焰
    澳大利亚共产党报纸“论坛报”15日说，艾森豪威尔正陷入怒海中。它说，艾森豪威尔到处激起愤怒的火焰，“他无法用花言巧语来把自己装扮成一个友好的使者。”
    “论坛”周报指出，艾森豪威尔这次“访问”只不过是帝国主义者显示实力的企图罢了。
    挪威“自由报”说
    美帝国主义脚下的土地正在燃烧
    挪威共产党机关报“自由报”14日就艾森豪威尔访问日本发表社论说，艾森豪威尔将从避弹玻璃后面看到愤怒地反对日美军事条约的日本人民。
    社论指出，美国政府和日本反动派要把美日军事条约强加于日本人民头上的阴谋，已经使日本人民的愤怒情绪沸腾起来。日本人民不断以坚决的斗争来反对这个军事条约，而且越来越多的人卷入了这个斗争。
    社论说，日本人民的斗争已经使岸信介政府摇摇欲坠。美帝国主义脚下的土地正在燃烧。
