Small commodities, in terms of variety, number at least two or three thousand. In terms of use, some are daily necessities, some are production and construction materials, and some are health care products; some can be used, some can be worn, some can eliminate diseases and pests, and some are important export commodities. In terms of need, from cities to the countryside, regardless of men, women, old or young, they will feel inconvenienced if they lack them. In terms of their position in the social commodity supply, they cannot be ignored. According to preliminary estimates, small commodities account for about 35% to 40% of the total social commodity circulation. Therefore, grasping small commodity production is an important issue related to people's lives.

From the current situation, it is entirely possible to rapidly develop the production of small commodities. In particular, many factories have undergone technological revolutions and achieved mechanized and automated production. After completing their main production plans, they can free up more time and technical force to engage in diversified operations and increase the production of daily necessities. By extracting only a small portion of the by-products, offcuts and waste materials from many large factories, and with simple processing, tens of millions of daily necessities can be produced. Since cities have widely established and developed street industries after vigorously setting up people's communes, fully utilizing this new force can enable small commodities to continuously increase output, increase variety, and supply the ever-growing needs of the people's lives.

Does this mean that the production of small commodities can be viewed as very simple? No. Small commodities are scattered and sporadic. After arranging the production of these kinds of products, it will be discovered that other commodities need to be supplied in large quantities. Therefore, local leading organs must constantly grasp the production and allocation of small commodities and must place it in an appropriate position. Now, many provinces and cities have set an example in this regard. In addition to attaching importance to the unified arrangement of labor and raw materials ideologically, they also organize industrial and commercial collaboration, mobilize the masses to tap production potential, add varieties, and gradually incorporate small commodity production into the national plan, thereby further ensuring the production of small commodities.

In order to meet the diverse needs of the people in their daily lives, to support industrial and agricultural production, and to invigorate the market, let the production of small commodities leap forward and reach new heights!

    小商品不“小”
    小商品，论品种至少也有两、三千种。论用途，有的是日用杂品，有的是生产建筑材料，有的是卫生保健用品；有的可以用，有的可以穿，有的可以除病灭害，有的还是出口的重要商品。论需要，从城市到农村，无论男女老幼，一旦缺了它，就会感到不方便。论它在社会商品供应中的地位，更是不能忽视的。据初步估计，小商品约占社会商品流通总额的35％至40％。因此，抓紧小商品生产是关系人民生活的重要问题。
    从当前的形势来看，迅速发展小商品生产是完全可能的。特别是很多工厂经过技术革命，实现了机械化和自动化生产，在完成主要生产计划后，能够腾出更多的时间和技术力量大搞多种经营，增加日用小商品生产。很多大工厂的副产品和边料、废料，只需抽出很少一部分，经过简单的加工，就可生产出数以千万计的日用小商品。城市大办人民公社以后，普遍建立和发展了街道工业，充分运用这支新的力量，就能够使小商品不断增加产量，增加花色品种，供应人民生活日益增长的需要。
    这样，是不是就能够把小商品生产看得很简单呢？不能。小商品零星分散，安排了生产这些种产品，又会发现另一些商品需要大量供应。因此，各地领导机关要不断抓紧小商品的生产和调运工作，必须把它放在适当的地位。现在，很多省市已经在这方面树立了榜样。他们除了在思想上重视统一安排劳动力和原材料外，还组织工商协作，动员群众挖掘生产潜力，增添花色品种，并使小商品生产逐步纳入国家计划，从而使小商品生产更加有了保证。
    为了满足人民在日常生活中多种多样的需要，为了支援工农业生产和活跃市场，让小商品生产跃进登高，更上一层楼！
