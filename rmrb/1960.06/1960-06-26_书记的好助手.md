    A Good Helper to the Secretary
    During the most intense period of the drought resistance and seedling protection struggle, the staff of the postal and telecommunications system in our county, district, and commune installed telephones on the hillsides, allowing the Party committee secretaries to make calls at any time. When the secretaries went down to the production teams, we equipped them with portable switchboards so they could connect to the phone lines at any time. In addition, we proactively contacted the offices of Party committees at all levels to establish a system for forecasting the secretaries' whereabouts. The staff boldly innovated and created a "Secretary's Whereabouts Indicator Board" to keep track of the secretaries' locations, ensuring that letters, reports, and telephone calls could reach the secretaries wherever they went. Our postal and telecommunications staff also proactively disseminated weather forecasts. When the commune Party committee secretary was not at home, the telephone operator would receive reports on their behalf and forward materials to the district committee. When the Provincial Party Committee instructed that more than 80% of the labor force should be concentrated on the agricultural front line, the postal worker would report the number of workers on the job to the management area every day, enabling the Party committee to keep abreast of the production situation in a timely manner. When commune postmen went out on their rounds, they always paid attention to understanding the agricultural production situation in various places and reported back to the Party committee upon their return. We also often circled the learning and reading content in the newspapers with a pen according to the instructions of the Party committee and assigned the reading of the newspapers to the production teams. Therefore, the Party committee praised the staff of our postal and telecommunications system as the commune's "six members" (postal worker, communications worker, production inspector, receiver and dispatcher, reporter, and receptionist) and a powerful helper to the commune Party committee secretary.

    书记的好助手
    我们县、区、社邮电系统的职工，最近在抗旱保苗斗争最紧张的时刻，把电话机架到山坡上，让党委书记们随时可以通电话。书记下生产队，我们就配备了皮包机随时可搭线通电话；另外，大家还主动和各级党委办公室联系，建立书记行踪预报制度。职工们大胆革新，制成了“书记行踪指示盘”，掌握书记的去向，做到书记走到哪里，信报就送到哪里，电话也通到哪里。我们邮电职工还主动传告天气预报。公社党委书记不在家时，话务员就代收汇报，代向区委汇报资料。当省委指示80％以上的劳力集中农业第一线时，邮电员同志就每天代向管理区报告出工人数，使党委及时掌握生产情况；社邮递员出班时，总是留心了解各地农业生产情况，回来向党委汇报。我们还经常根据党委的指示，在报纸上用笔圈定学习读报内容，向生产队布置读报。因此党委表扬我们邮电系统的职工是公社的“六员”（邮电员、通信员、生产检查员、收发员、汇报员、招待员），是公社党委书记的有力助手。
