Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd. After expanding the early rice acreage by three million mu, Jiangxi province is taking advantage of the situation to expand the mid-season rice and single-season late rice acreage, and is actively preparing to expand the double-season late rice acreage, striving to plant four million mu more of mid- and late-season rice than last year.

Currently, millions of laborers across the province are working hard in the fields, intensifying the management of early rice while rushing to plant mid-season rice and single-season late rice, and preparing for double-season late rice by accumulating fertilizer and manufacturing tools. Various production tasks are progressing rapidly and victoriously. So far, the province has planted 1.5 million mu of mid-season and single-season late rice, completing 22% of the area to be planted.

With a large expansion task and a requirement for high-quality planting, coupled with the heavy tasks of early rice field management and summer harvesting, the use of labor is relatively tight. Therefore, solving the labor shortage and meeting labor needs have become important keys to realizing the expansion plan for mid-season and single-season late rice. Various localities, while not affecting early rice field management and summer harvesting, have concentrated a group of laborers to form specialized teams for plowing, seedling pulling, and transplanting, establishing a production responsibility system of fixed fields and contracted work. On this basis, they have launched labor competitions, greatly improving labor attendance rate and production efficiency, thereby ensuring the labor needs for completing the expansion task.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has entered the busy season for transplanting mid-season rice. At present, various localities have planted more than 3 million mu of mid-season rice and are trying every possible means to continue expanding the planting area.

This year, Guangxi has opened up and expanded the planting of more than 10 million mu of high-yield food crops such as early rice, corn, beans, and sweet potatoes. After cultivation and management, all crops are generally growing well. Now, various localities are continuing to expand the planting area of mid-season rice by adopting measures such as utilizing vacant and wasteland, converting dry land into paddy fields, using dry land for seedling cultivation to free up paddy fields for expanding mid-season rice planting, and plowing and replanting early rice fields that have died due to drought. According to statistics from Liujiang County, in the 100,000-mu high-yield area of ​​only seven communes including Labao and Jinde, more than 17,000 mu of abandoned and missed fields have been found that can be expanded for mid-season rice planting.

Xinhua News Agency reports: "Ensure quality, quantity, and timeliness; mid-season rice planting must be completed before Mangzhong (Grain in Ear)," Jiangsu province has generally started transplanting mid-season rice, and the areas along both sides of the Yangtze River, where the season is earlier, have entered a climax of rushing to transplant. As of May 26, the province had planted more than 4 million mu of mid-season rice. After inspections and acceptance at all levels, the vast majority met the specifications and quality requirements such as deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and reasonable close planting. On May 19, as soon as mid-season rice transplanting began, cadres at all levels, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, went deep into the front lines to lead the masses in a concentrated effort to transplant mid-season rice. Cadres at all levels in the Liulang Commune of Jiangning County adopted the method of assigning areas and layers of responsibility to ensure that every area had a leader, every team had a general, and every group had a backbone, so that the commune's 20,000 mu of mid-season rice was quickly transplanted.

During the transplanting process, all localities launched a red flag competition centered on ensuring quality, ensuring acreage, and ensuring timeliness.

Xinhua News Agency reports: A new upsurge of early planting, more planting, and faster planting of mid-season rice has been launched in Sichuan. As of May 25, the province had planted more than 17 million mu of mid-season rice. Many counties in Nanchong and Neijiang prefectures, which are progressing faster, have completed the mid-season rice transplanting task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota with quality and quantity guaranteed. Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership as soon as mid-season rice transplanting began, and leading cadres at all levels personally took charge and directed the battle. More than 23,000 leaders of Party organizations at all levels and more than 200,000 rural work cadres in Neijiang Prefecture went to the fields, divided areas and contracted tasks, and rushed to transplant mid-season rice with the masses, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses. In just over 20 days, the entire prefecture basically completed the transplanting of mid-season rice.

Various localities have also universally launched competitions for high work efficiency and high quality, and vigorously promoted the use of various improved tools such as rice transplanters. Jiajiang County, under the slogan of "seizing time and striving for every second, grasping quality with meticulous care," launched a competition in which everyone exceeded their quota and everyone achieved high work efficiency. The county's daily transplanting progress quickly increased from more than 5,000 mu to more than 8,000 mu, and the county's 110,000 mu of mid-season rice was completely transplanted more than half a month earlier than last year, and the quality was also good.

Hefei, June 3rd. After completing the early rice transplanting task, Anhui province immediately rationally arranged labor and farm work, and transplanted mid-season rice while rushing to harvest summer crops. Up to now, more than 4.8 million mu have been planted, and Liu'an Prefecture, which is progressing faster, has completed the mid-season rice transplanting task, exceeding the quota by 130,000 mu.

Anhui Province's planned area for mid-season rice this year is larger than last year, and most of it will not be able to free up stubble for transplanting until after rapeseed, wheat and barley are harvested. According to the experience that early transplanting of mid-season rice can avoid and reduce pests and diseases and droughts in previous years, Party committees at all levels have grasped the arrangement of farm work and labor as soon as summer harvesting began to ensure that mid-season rice is transplanted into the fields in a timely manner. Anqing Prefecture made a unified arrangement for the labor force for the current summer harvest, early rice field management, and mid-season rice transplanting, greatly accelerating the transplanting progress. As of May 27, the prefecture had transplanted more than 470,000 mu of mid-season rice, accounting for more than 76% of the planned area.

According to the maturity of summer crops, Wuhu Prefecture formulated a harvesting and planting plan, deciding to plant mid-season rice in early-maturing wheat fields and single-season late rice in late-maturing wheat fields; transplant mid-season rice in early-maturing native rapeseed fields and single-season late rice in late-maturing "Victory Rapeseed" fields. In terms of labor arrangement, the prefecture invested more than one million main laborers in rushing to harvest and rush to plant, and formed professional teams based on physical strength and technology. As of May 29, the prefecture had planted 780,000 mu of mid-season rice, and seven counties and cities had completed and exceeded the mid-season rice transplanting task.

Liu'an Prefecture had completed the mid-season rice transplanting task, exceeding the quota by 130,000 mu as of May 28.

Wuhan, June 3rd. Hubei province is in the tense period of rushing to transplant mid-season rice to win a decisive victory. After the hard work of about three million transplanting hands in the province, various localities have now transplanted more than 10 million mu of mid-season rice. Huanggang Prefecture and Honghu County on the Jianghan Plain, which are progressing faster in transplanting, have completed their transplanting plans, exceeding the quota by 18% and 150% respectively. The transplanting teams in various localities are still advancing victoriously and continuing to carry out the "three guarantees" (guaranteeing acreage, guaranteeing season, and guaranteeing quality) movement, trying every possible means to expand the transplanting area.

Hubei Province is one of China's main rice-producing areas. The entire rice area accounts for about half of the province's cultivated land area, and the mid-season rice area accounts for about half of the rice area. Therefore, striving for a complete victory in mid-season rice transplanting has always been a major key to increasing agricultural production in this province. In order to ensure that the transplanting season is not missed, various localities, while rationally arranging labor, have vigorously launched transplanting skill contests and carried out high work efficiency movements in transplanting. Jiang Meiying, a transplanting expert in Jingshan County, created a high work efficiency record of transplanting an average of two to three mu per day (4×5 inch specifications). The Jingshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly summarized her experience and launched a movement to learn from Jiang Meiying throughout the county. Due to the vast number of transplanting hands learning from Jiang Meiying, the average daily transplanting efficiency of mid-season rice in the county increased by more than 70%. After learning from the high work efficiency experience of Lei Kaiguo, a transplanting expert in Dangyang County, the 180,000-strong transplanting army in Yidu area generally increased their transplanting work efficiency by about 60%.

The most important link in ensuring the quality of mid-season rice transplanting is applying sufficient base fertilizer. Many areas launched a concentrated fertilizer accumulation and delivery movement before the start of mid-season rice transplanting. Xiangyang Prefecture organized more than 500,000 people to deliver and accumulate fertilizer for mid-season rice fields before transplanting.

In order to ensure that the battle of mid-season rice transplanting is fought well, various localities have concentrated superior forces to the front line of production. In Wuhan area, 50,000 laborers were drawn from various agencies, organizations, schools, and troops in Wuhan City to go to the countryside to help with transplanting.

Kunming, June 3rd. Plant one mu well, manage one mu well. In the late stage of planting mid-season rice and corn in southern Yunnan, people did not remove their armor and immediately turned to summer field management work.

The Simao, Lincang, Honghe, Wenshan, and western Dehong prefectures and autonomous prefectures in southern Yunnan have basically completed the basic farmland planting. By the end of May, these areas had planted 11 million mu of major spring grain crops. While achieving the basic victory in the first battle of drought-resistant planting, Party committees at all levels seriously analyzed the current situation. They believe that this year, under the severe drought conditions, the planting of large-area high-yield crops was done earlier and better than in previous years, gaining a head start for this year's autumn harvest. Seizing the opportunity and immediately turning to field management work to take the initiative and eliminate the three types of seedlings before they occur is an important matter in current agricultural production.

    扩大中稻面积多种多收
    江西广西江苏四川安徽湖北抢栽中稻
    云南积极培育中稻把三类苗消灭在发生以前
    本报南昌3日电　江西扩种了三百万亩早稻后，乘胜扩种中稻、一季晚稻，并积极为扩种二季晚稻作好准备，全力争取中、晚稻比去年多种四百万亩。
    目前，全省数百万劳动大军奋战田间，一面加紧培育早稻，一面抢插中稻、一季晚稻，以及为二季晚稻积造肥料、赶制工具，各项生产进度神速，节节胜利。至今，全省已栽插中稻、一季晚稻一百五十万亩，完成应插面积的22％。季节较早的赣南行政区各县，已经基本结束中稻和一季晚稻插秧。
    扩种任务大，又要求种得好，加上早稻田间管理和夏收任务繁重，劳力使用比较紧张；因此，解决劳力不足、满足劳力需要，便成为实现中稻、一季晚稻扩种计划的重要关键。各地便在不影响早稻田间管理、夏收的原则下，集中一批劳力，组成耕作、拔秧、插秧等各种专业队，建立定田包工的生产责任制，在此基础上开展劳动竞赛，使劳动出勤率、生产效率大大提高，从而保证了完成扩种任务的劳力需要。
    据新华社讯　广西僮族自治区已进入中稻插秧大忙季节。目前，各地已栽插中稻三百多万亩，并在千方百计地继续扩大种植面积。
    今年广西各地开荒扩种早稻、玉米、豆类、薯类等高产粮食作物一千多万亩。各项作物经过中耕管理，一般都生长良好。现在，各地又在根据具体情况，采取利用空田荒地，把旱田改水田；利用旱地育秧，腾出水田扩种中稻；翻犁改种早稻旱死田等办法，继续扩大中稻种植面积。据柳江县统计，仅拉堡、进德等七个公社十万亩丰产区就查出丢荒田、漏插田一万七千多亩可以扩种中稻。
    据新华社讯　“保质保量保农时，中稻不过芒种关”，江苏全省普遍开始栽插中稻，季节较早的长江两岸地区已经进入抢插高潮。到5月26日止，全省已栽插中稻四百多万亩。经过层层检查验收，绝大部分符合深耕、足肥、合理密植等规格质量要求。19日，中稻栽秧一开始，各级干部就在党委统一领导下，深入到第一线去，领导广大群众突击栽插中稻。江宁县六郎公社各级干部，采取分片包干、层层包干的办法，做到片片有帅，队队有将，组组有骨干，使全社二万亩中稻很快栽插结束。
    在栽插中，各地都开展了以保质量、保面积、保农时为中心的红旗竞赛。
    据新华社讯　四川各地掀起早栽多栽快栽中稻的生产新高潮。到5月25日，全省已栽中稻一千七百多万亩。进度较快的南充、内江专区许多县已按质按量提前超额完成中稻栽插任务。各级党委在中稻栽插一开始就加强了领导，各级领导干部都亲自上阵，指挥战斗。内江专区二万三千多名各级党组织负责人和二十多万农村工作干部都到田间，划片包干，和群众一道抢栽中稻，大大鼓舞了群众的积极性，仅用二十多天时间，全区就基本插完了中稻。
    各地还普遍开展高工效、高质量的竞赛运动，大力推广使用插秧机等各种改良工具。夹江县在“抢时间分秒必争，抓质量一丝不苟”的口号下，开展了人人破定额、个个高工效的竞赛运动，全县栽秧日进度迅速由五千多亩增加到八千多亩，全县十一万亩中稻比去年提早半个多月全部栽完，而且质量也好。
    本报合肥3日电　安徽各地继完成早稻插秧任务之后，立即合理安排了劳力和农活，在抢收夏收作物的同时，大插中稻。到目前止，已栽四百八十多万亩，进度较快的六安专区，已超额十三万亩完成了中稻栽插任务。
    安徽省今年中稻的计划面积比去年扩大，而且大部分要等油菜和大、小麦收割以后才能腾出茬口栽插。各级党委根据历年来中稻早插可以避免和减轻病虫害和旱灾的经验，夏收一开始，便抓紧了农活和劳力的安排，以保证中稻及时插下田。安庆专区把当前夏收、早稻田间管理、中稻栽插的劳力作了统一安排，大大地加快了栽插进度。到5月27日，全区已插中稻四十七万多亩，占计划面积76％以上。
    芜湖专区根据夏季作物成熟的迟早，订出了收、种规划，决定在早熟小麦田里栽中稻，迟熟小麦田里栽单季晚稻；成熟期早的土种油菜田里插中稻，晚熟的“胜利油菜”田里插单季晚稻。在劳力安排上，又把全区主力一百余万人投入抢收、抢种，并根据体力、技术组成专业队。全区到5月29日已栽了中稻七十八万亩，已有七个县市完成和超额完成了中稻栽插任务。
    六安专区到5月28日已超额十三万亩完成了中稻栽插任务。
    本报武汉3日电　湖北省抢插中稻已进入夺取决定性胜利的紧张时期。经过全省三百万左右插秧手奋力抢插，目前，各地已插中稻一千多万亩，插秧进度较快的黄冈专区和江汉平原上的洪湖县，并已分别超额18％和150％完成了插秧计划。各地插秧队伍目前仍在乘胜前进，继续大搞“三保”（保面积、保季节、保质量）运动，千方百计地扩大插秧面积。
    湖北省是我国主要产稻区之一，整个水稻面积约占全省耕地面积一半左右，而中稻面积又占水稻面积的一半左右。因此，争取中稻插秧全胜，历来就是这个省农业增产的一大关键。为了保证不误插秧季节，各地在合理安排劳力的同时，大搞插秧能手比武竞赛，开展插秧高工效运动。京山县插秧能手姜美英创造平均日插二亩到三亩（规格4×5寸）的插秧高工效纪录，中共京山县委就及时总结她的经验，在全县范围内开展学习姜美英的运动。由于广大插秧手学习姜美英，全县中稻日插效率平均提高了70％多。宜都地区十八万插秧大军学习了当阳县插秧能手雷开国的高工效经验后，插秧工效一般也都提高了60％左右。
    保证中稻插秧质量，最重要的一环是施足底肥。许多地区在中稻开始插秧前都开展了一次突击积肥、送肥运动。襄阳专区在插秧前组织了五十多万人为中稻田送肥、积肥。
    为了保证把中稻插秧这一仗打好，各地都集中优势兵力到生产第一线，武汉地区仅从武汉市各机关、团体、学校、部队抽出下乡帮助插秧的劳力就有五万人。
    本报昆明3日电　种好一亩、管好一亩。云南南部地区在中稻和包谷的栽种后期人不卸甲，立即转入夏季田间管理工作。
    云南南部的思茅、临沧、红河、文山和西部的德宏等专区、自治州，目前基本农田已经基本栽插播种完毕，到5月底这些地区栽种的大春粮食作物已达一千一百多万亩，在抗旱栽种工作取得第一个战役的基本胜利的同时，各级党委认真分析了当前的形势。认为今年在严重干旱的情况下，大面积高产作物的栽种工作比往年种得早、种得好，为今年的秋季大丰收夺得了先机之利。抓住时机，立即转入田间管理工作，以争取主动把三类苗消灭在发生之前，是当前农业生产上的一件重要事情。（附图片）
