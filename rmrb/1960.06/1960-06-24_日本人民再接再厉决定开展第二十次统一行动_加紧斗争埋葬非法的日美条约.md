The Japanese People Continue Their Efforts and Decide to Launch the 20th Unified Action
Intensifying the Struggle to Bury the Illegal Japan-U.S. Treaty
Not Allowing a Second Nobusuke Kishi to Come to Power; Establishing a Caretaker Government Composed of Parliamentary Forces Outside the Kishi Group
Japanese Communist Party, Socialist Party, and others Issue Statements Respectively; National Council and General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) Decide on a Policy of Intensifying the Struggle

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Socialist Party, the National Council, and Sohyo issued statements on the 23rd respectively.

The Japanese Communist Party stated in its declaration that the instruments of ratification for the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" were secretly exchanged by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet with the United States amidst the high tide of opposition from the Japanese people. This action by the government is invalid because the Japanese people did not agree to this treaty; this illegal treaty should be abolished in the name of the Japanese people. The statement pointed out that the reactionaries are preparing to send another Kishi Nobusuke to power so that the new prime minister can inherit Kishi Nobusuke's policy of strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance and intensifying the suppression of the people's democratic movement. The statement said that the Communist Party will never allow this conspiracy to be realized.
"We have always advocated the establishment of a caretaker government composed of all parliamentary forces outside the Kishi group. This is also the demand put forward by the overwhelming majority of the Japanese people."

The Japanese Socialist Party said in its statement that the new "Security Treaty" has neither binding force nor authority over the Japanese people. The Socialist Party guarantees that it will wage a struggle to bury the new "Security Treaty" and smash the political and social system maintained by the "Security Treaty."

The National Council's statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke group "adopted a series of unacceptable absurd conclusions and extremely bizarre procedures" to complete the "ratification" procedures. The statement said, "We once again declare that the Japanese people reject this treaty which 'takes effect' completely disregarding the will of the people's independence and autonomy." The statement said, "Although Kishi Nobusuke announced his intention to resign, it would be tantamount to mocking the people if he thinks that simply issuing such a resignation statement can appease the people." The statement said, "We will never relax the struggle until the security treaty is declared illegal, the Diet is dissolved, and the reactionary initiators of this treaty are driven out of politics."

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) said in its statement that we will never be deceived by the compromise measures that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are attempting to take, and we will resolutely oppose any of those politicians who have stained their hands in the dirty dealings of forcibly passing the security treaty to replace Kishi Nobusuke.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" held a meeting today, reiterating its position of refusing to recognize the new "Security Treaty," and decided to launch the 20th national unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The meeting decided to retroactively recognize the June 22nd protest rally and general strike as the 19th national unified action. The action program adopted at the meeting stipulates that in the 20th unified action, a mass protest rally will be held near the Diet on June 25th, as well as protest rallies in various regions and workplaces; representatives of local organizations of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" will hold a meeting on June 28th, and a mass protest rally with 300,000 participants will be held in Tokyo on July 2nd.

The program stipulates that while the mass rally is held in Tokyo on July 2nd, mass rallies will also be held throughout Japan, declaring the new "Security Treaty" completely invalid and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a council meeting and a meeting of representatives of various industry trade unions today, determining the basic attitude of absolutely not recognizing the new "Security Treaty" and adopting a policy of intensifying the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" in the future.

The current action plan adopted at the meeting stipulates that Sohyo will mobilize as many Tokyo workers as possible to participate in the national funeral for Michiko Kamba scheduled for June 24th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's atrocities.

The plan stipulates that Sohyo will hold rallies throughout the country and at various posts on June 25th to strongly protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty."

The plan points out that the dying Kishi Nobusuke government may suppress the trade unions, and Sohyo is prepared to launch a thorough counterattack, and will hold a unified action of various industry trade unions on July 2nd to protest illegal suppression.

The plan stipulates that after July, Sohyo will hold lectures throughout the country together with progressive political parties, cultural figures, and students to launch vigorous propaganda activities.

The meeting passed election slogans. These slogans include establishing a peaceful and democratic government; establishing and implementing a neutral policy that can guarantee Japan's security; transforming the military industry that symbolizes Japan-U.S. cooperation into a peaceful industry that improves living standards; opposing military expenditures and demanding increased social insurance expenditures; opposing industrial "rationalization" and personnel reductions; achieving full employment; striving for victory in the Miike coal mine workers' struggle, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: Approximately seven hundred university students in Tokyo held a four-hour demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States government's exchange of instruments of ratification for the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" this morning.

The demonstrators demanded to meet with Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama. After about three hours of negotiations, ten students were allowed to meet with an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and hand him a letter of protest addressed to the Foreign Minister.

Shortly after 5:00 p.m., they marched past Kishi Nobusuke's official residence, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and the U.S. Embassy, before dispersing near Shinbashi Station. They shouted slogans against the new "Security Treaty" in front of the U.S. Embassy.

    日本人民再接再厉决定开展第二十次统一行动
    加紧斗争埋葬非法的日美条约
    不让第二个岸信介上台，成立岸集团以外的议会力量组成的看守政府
    日共和社会党等分别发表声明，国民会议和总评决定加紧斗争的方针
    本报讯　据新华社消息：日本共产党、日本社会党、国民会议和总评于23日分别发表声明。
    日本共产党在声明中指出，新日美“安全条约”的批准书是岸信介内阁在日本人民反对的高潮中偷偷地同美国交换的。政府的这种行动是无效的，因为日本人民并没有同意这个条约；应当以日本人民的名义废除这项非法的条约。声明指出，反动派正在准备派另一个岸信介上台，以便使新首相继承岸信介关于加强日美军事同盟的政策和加强对人民民主运动的镇压。声明说，共产党永远不容许这种阴谋实现。
  “我们一直主张成立由岸集团以外的一切议会力量所组成的看守政府。这也是压倒多数的日本人民所提出的要求。”
    日本社会党在声明中说，新“安全条约”对日本人民既没有约束力，也没有权力。社会党保证将进行斗争来葬送新“安全条约”和粉碎“安全条约”所维持的政治和社会制度。
    国民会议的声明说，岸信介集团“采取了一系列不能容许的荒谬绝论和非常离奇的程序”来完成
  “批准”手续。声明说，“我们再一次宣布，日本人民拒绝完全漠视人民独立自主的意志情况下‘生效’的这项条约。”声明说，“虽然岸信介宣布了他辞职的意图，但是如果他认为只要发表这样的辞职声明就能安慰人民，那等于是嘲弄人民。声明说，“我们将永远不会放松斗争，直到安全条约被宣布为非法，国会被解散和这个条约的反动的发起人被逐出政界为止。”
    日本工会总评议会在声明中说，我们决不会受岸信介内阁和自由民主党企图采取的妥协措施的欺骗，我们将坚决地反对任何那些强行通过安全条约的肮脏勾当中染污了双手的政客之一来代替岸信介。
