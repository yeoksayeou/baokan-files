    The seaside here has the most enchanting scenery at dusk. The sun turns into a large expanse of fiery red clouds, seeming to sink and float at the juncture of the sea and sky, letting the sea dissolve its remaining radiance. The sea, pulsating with thousands of fragments of gold, glitters and sparkles. The rows of brand-new, snow-white houses standing on the shore, illuminated by the waves, shine brightly, like clusters of orchids blooming in the sunlight. The children, wearing clothes the same color as the sea and red scarves, return home from school. On the way, they sing joyfully, their rugged and melodious songs soaring into the azure sky, falling into the sea, and drifting far away with the pulsating waves.

    As if summoned by the children's songs, or as if descending from the sky, the brown-yellow sails, one, two… gradually appear on the horizon. The fishing boats come closer and closer. The first to run out to greet them are the children, who have just put down their rice bowls and bared their red chests. They wave their arms vigorously, puffing out their round little cheeks and shouting "doo, doo, doo". The older women, also carrying children and dragging their wooden clogs, walk out of their houses with the unique leisure and tranquility of after-dinner. Almost all the young and middle-aged women in the fishing village have gone out to sea. The few girls who stayed behind to work in the canteen and nursery also tiptoe behind the crowd, their hearts pounding, looking towards the shimmering sea, searching for their loved ones.

    Gradually, people see the silver light leaping in the cabins and see the people they are waiting for standing on the bow, waving. The people on the shore cheer, and the people on the boats blow conch shells. The sea is dancing with joy, and people's hearts are as bright and passionate as the sea.

    Just as the fleet docks, several cars screech to a halt in the cheering crowd. Then, the high-pitched calls of the weighers reporting "eight hundred," "one thousand," the shouts and calls of the men, and the hearty laughter of the girls, combined with the sound of the waves lapping against the shore, form a harvest symphony, floating on the vast sea...

    People are immersed in joy, not even noticing the milk-like moonlight spilling over them. Only after the boatloads of fish are loaded onto trucks and transported to the nearby processing plants and canneries, and the fishing village slowly returns to tranquility, do people realize that the moon, like a polished, smooth mirror, leaps from the bottom of the sea and hangs in the azure sky, pouring down its clear and bright radiance. Then, the sea shimmers with vast expanses of silver light, a thin layer of blue mist floats in the sky, and the rows of houses become even whiter, as if the fishing village has become a world of silver.

    Just then, a burst of passionate and joyful flute music rises from the silver-shimmering sea. From the flute music, people see the leaping fish, think of the joy of the harvest, and taste the sweetness of life. Young men and women cannot help but sing along with the flute music; the women sitting and resting in the doorway also suddenly stop laughing, listening excitedly to the fervent flute music...

    I know this flute music comes from the heart of a blind man. Sixteen years ago, his eyes were blinded by the cruel fishing tyrant with needles. At that time, whenever dark clouds filled the sky and storms raged, people stood on steep cliffs with sorrow, praying for their loved ones; whenever dark nights fell, and a few broken boats carried some fishermen who had survived from the turbulent sea, while the relatives of the dead wailed, he would play that desolate flute sound, as sad as the night!

    How many nights! As I snuggled in my mother's arms, listening to the howling of the sea wind, and thinking of my father who had gone out to sea and not returned, the flute sound would ring out, and my mother would weep softly...

    One day, I stood in front of my father's grave, silently mourning my father who had died in the suffering of the old society. The flute sound rang out again. However, the tone was full of hope—this was the first time I had heard it.

    From then on, whenever the returning fleet had a bountiful harvest; whenever there was a happy event in the fishing village; whenever there was a moonlit night, a burst of joyful flute music would rise from the tranquil sea...

    海上的笛声
    蔡金才
    我们这里的海边，黄昏的景色是最迷人不过的。太阳变成一大片火似的红云，在海天相接处欲沉又浮，任凭海水溶尽它的余辉。海，跳动着万千块碎金，粼粼闪闪。那矗立岸上一排排崭新雪白的屋舍，在波光辉映下，亮亮闪闪，宛如盛开在阳光下的簇簇兰花。孩子们穿着跟海一般颜色的衣服，系着红领巾，从学校放学回家。一路上他们欢乐地唱着，那粗犷动听的歌声，冲向碧天，跌落海中，随着跳动的光波，向远方飘散。
    仿佛是孩子们的歌声唤来的，又仿佛是从天上飘降而下，那棕黄色的渔帆，一叶、二叶……从天边水平线上冉冉出现。渔船，越来越近。最先跑出来迎接的，是刚放下饭碗，裸着赤红胸膛的孩子。他们极力地挥着双臂，鼓着圆圆的小腮“嘟、嘟、嘟”地高喊着，上了年纪的妇人们，也抱着孩子，拖着木屐，带着晚饭后特有的幽闲与静谧，从屋里步来。渔村里的青壮年女人几乎所有都出海去了，几个留下在食堂、托儿所工作的姑娘们，这时也跟在人们身后，偷偷地踮起脚尖，心在急跳，向着金光闪烁的海上望去，寻找着自己的亲人。
    慢慢地，人们看见船舱里跳跃着银光，看清他们盼望的人站在船头招手了。岸上的人们欢呼起来，船上的人们也吹响了海螺。海在欢跳，人们的心境就像海水一样明亮、热烈。
    当船队刚刚靠岸时，几辆汽车霍地在欢腾的人群中煞住了。于是，司磅员高吭的“八百”“一千”的报数声，男人们的呼唤、?喝声，姑娘们爽朗的笑声，合着海涛拍岸的声响，汇成一曲丰收的乐章，在辽阔的海面上飘荡。……
    人们浸沉在欢乐中，连身上泻满了牛乳般的月光也不曾感到。待那一舱舱的鱼群被汽车载向不远处的加工场、罐头厂，渔村慢慢复归于宁静，人们才发觉，月亮像是一轮磨平的、光滑的明镜，从海底一跳，悬挂到碧天里，把那清冽的、皎洁的光辉泻下来。于是，海晃荡着万顷银光，天空浮起一层薄薄的青雾，幢幢排排的屋舍更加雪白了，渔村仿佛成了银的世界。
    就在这时，一阵热烈的欢腾的笛声，从银光闪烁的海面升起。从笛声中，人们看到欢跳的鱼群，想到丰收的喜悦，尝到生活的甜蜜。青年男女们不禁随着笛声纵情高唱；那在门口憩坐乘凉的妇人们也突地止住了欢笑，激动地听着这热烈的笛声……
    我知道这笛声吹自一个盲者的心中。十六年前，他的眼睛被凶残的渔霸用针刺瞎了。那时，每当乌云卷空、风狂雨骤，人们满怀悲哀，站在陡峭的巉岩上，为自己的亲人求卜；每当黯黑的深夜，几艘破船载着一些侥幸活着的渔民，从翻滚的大海回来，而死者的家属嚎啕大哭的时候，他，便吹起那凄凉的，悲哀得像黑夜的笛音！
    多少深夜啊！当我偎在妈妈的怀里，听着海风的呼啸，遥念着出海未回的爸爸，那笛音也就响起来了，我的妈妈就低低地哭泣……
    一天，我伫立在爸爸的墓前，默悼着在旧社会的苦难中去世的爸爸。那笛音又响起来了。不过，那声调是充满了希望的——这在我才第一次听到。
    这以后，每逢出海的船队丰收而归；每逢渔村有了喜事；每逢月明星稀的夜晚，一阵阵欢乐的笛音，便从平静的海面升起……
