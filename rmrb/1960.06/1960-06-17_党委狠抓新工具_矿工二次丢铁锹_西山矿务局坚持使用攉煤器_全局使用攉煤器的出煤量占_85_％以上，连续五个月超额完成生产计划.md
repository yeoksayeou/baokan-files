    The Xishan Mining Bureau Party committee in Shanxi Province, with the attitude of a firm promoter, enthusiastically supported new things, so that a major technological innovation in coal production - the promotion of coal hods - has gradually been consolidated and improved, promoting the continuous improvement of production levels.
    In January of this year, the leaders of the Xishan Mining Bureau Party committee led the workers in a three-day battle to promote the coal hods created by the Fuxin Coal Mine at high speed, realizing the semi-mechanization of the coal hodding process and increasing production efficiency by one and a half times. However, not long after the promotion, many coal hodders put the coal hods aside and picked up small shovels to hod coal again. After discovering this situation, the Bureau Party committee immediately organized forces to conduct investigations in Duerping, where the use was poor, and Qiligou, where the use was good, and found the reasons why the coal hods were not fully and normally used. There were three main points: First, leading cadres neglected ideological education work; second, there was a lack of specific organizational measures and the establishment of corresponding management systems, and the material supply and repair departments did not include the manufacture, supply, and repair of coal hods in the plan; the supply of coal hods was not timely, and parts were often lost or damaged, and the workers had to pick up small shovels again; third, there was a lack of determination to insist on promotion and use. Some cadres saw that the coal hod itself had some small shortcomings, and instead of actively improving them, they wavered in the face of new things.
    In order to reverse this situation, the Bureau Party committee closely combined solving ideological problems with solving practical organizational and technical problems. On the one hand, it criticized the wrong thinking about new things, vigorously publicized the advantages and great significance of promoting the use of coal hods, and repeatedly explained to the workers that the promotion of any advanced experience must have a familiarization process. After the technical operation is proficient, the coal hod will be used freely, and the efficiency will be greatly improved. On the other hand, it mobilized the masses to further improve the coal hod. After seventeen improvements, the coal hod became more flexible and perfect.
    In order to further normalize the use of coal hods, the bureau selected 44 model workers who operated coal hods and organized them to perform and teach techniques in various pits. Immediately afterwards, it widely organized a martial arts training and competition movement for promoting the use of coal hods between groups, teams, and pits. Through the martial arts competition, all coal hodders learned how to operate the coal hod. As the proficiency of the operation technology increased, the coal hodders went from being unwilling to use the coal hod to being willing to use it, and finally became an indispensable tool for production.
    In order to make the use of coal hods "legitimate," the Bureau Party committee then seized the improvement of production technology management and the adjustment of labor organization, creating favorable conditions for the normal use of coal hods.
    At present, the coal output from the normal use of coal hods in the entire bureau has reached more than 85% of the total mining volume. From January to May of this year, the national production plan has been overfulfilled month by month, and the average daily output in May was 12.7% higher than the highest daily output level last year.

    党委狠抓新工具　矿工二次丢铁锹
    西山矿务局坚持使用攉煤器
    全局使用攉煤器的出煤量占85％以上，连续五个月超额完成生产计划
    本报讯　山西省西山矿务局党委以坚定不移的促进派的态度，热情扶植新生事物，使煤炭生产上一项重大技术革新——攉煤器的推广，逐步获得巩固、提高，促使生产水平不断提高。
    今年1月间，西山矿务局党委领导职工激战三天，高速度推广了阜新煤矿创造的攉煤器，使攉煤工序实现了半机械化，生产效率提高一倍半。可是，推广以后不久，不少攉煤工把攉煤器放在一边，又拿起了小铁锹攉煤。局党委发现这种情况后，即组织力量到使用较差的杜儿坪和使用较好的七里沟坑进行调查摸底，发现了攉煤器没有全面正常使用的原因，主要有三点：一、领导干部忽视了思想教育工作；二、缺乏具体的组织措施和建立相应的管理制度，材料供应和修理部门没有把攉煤器的制造、供应、修理纳入计划之内；攉煤器供应不及时，零件又经常丢失损坏，工人们不得不重新拿起小铁锹；三、缺乏坚持推广使用的决心，有些干部看到攉煤器本身有些小缺点，不是积极地加以改进，而是在新事物面前动摇不定。
    为了扭转这种局面，局党委把解决思想问题和解决组织上与技术上的实际问题密切结合起来。一方面批判对待新生事物的错误思想，大力宣传推广使用攉煤器的优越性和重大意义，反复向工人说明，任何先进经验的推广，必须有个熟练的过程，技术操作熟练以后，攉煤器就会运用自如，效率就会大大提高。另一方面，发动群众进一步改进攉煤器，前后经过十七次改进，使攉煤器更灵巧、更完善。
    为了进一步使攉煤器使用正常化，全局选拔出操作攉煤器的标兵四十四人，组织他们到各坑表演、传授技术。紧接着，又广泛地组织组与组、队与队、坑与坑之间，展开推广使用攉煤器的练武、比武竞赛运动。通过比武竞赛，使所有的攉煤工学会了攉煤器的操作。随着操作技术熟练程度的提高，攉煤工由不愿意使用攉煤器到愿意使用，最后成为生产上离不开的工具。
    为了使攉煤器的使用“合法化”，局党委接着就抓紧改进生产技术管理和调整劳动组织的工作，为正常使用攉煤器创造了有利条件。
    目前，全局正常使用攉煤器的出煤量已达到整个回采量的85％以上，今年1至5月都逐月地超额完成了国家生产计划，5月份平均日产量比去年最高日产水平还高12．7％。
