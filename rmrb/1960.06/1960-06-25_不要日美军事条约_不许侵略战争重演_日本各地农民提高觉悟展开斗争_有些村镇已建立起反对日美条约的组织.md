Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 24th: The "Mainichi Shimbun" of Japan published an article on the 23rd, introducing the struggle of Japanese farmers against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," saying that Japanese farmers share a common feeling: no repetition of aggressive war.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" quoted survey materials from the "National Scholars and Researchers Association for the Defense of Democracy" conducted in rural areas of Gunma, Chiba, and Saitama prefectures on June 9th and 10th.

The article said that in Gunma Prefecture, during the tenth national unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" last December, farmers in Gunan Village braved the heavy rain and held a demonstration parade driving farming machines. They used loudspeakers to call on farmers to rise up against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The article said that more than 700 farmers in Gunan Village signed the petition against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The article pointed out that in areas where the farmer movement is relatively developed, the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" is very active. In Chiba Prefecture, wherever struggles have been launched to demand higher sweet potato purchase prices, mass struggles against the new "Security Treaty" have also been launched.

The article pointed out that the working class played a decisive role in the development of the anti-"Security Treaty" political struggle in rural areas. In places where joint worker-peasant struggle organizations were established during the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and the establishment of the "Performance Evaluation" system, the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" was actively launched.

The article said that in order to carry out joint struggles more effectively, Gunma Prefecture has established the "Gunma Prefecture People's Federation for the Defense of Democracy." Some rural areas have already established organizations against the "Security Treaty" in towns and villages.

    不要日美军事条约　不许侵略战争重演
    日本各地农民提高觉悟展开斗争
    有些村镇已建立起反对日美条约的组织
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本“每日新闻”23日发表文章，介绍日本农村反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争情况说，日本农民都抱着共同的心情——不许侵略战争重演。
      “每日新闻”在文章中引用了日本“全国学者、研究家维护民主会”在6月9、10日两天对群马、千叶、埼玉等三县农村进行的调查材料。
    文章说，在群马县，去年12月里展开阻止修改“安全条约”第十次全国统一行动时，群南村的农民冒着倾盆大雨驾驶着耕种机举行了示威游行，他们通过扩音器呼吁农民们起来反对修改“安全条约”。
    文章说，群南村有七百多名农民在反对修改“安全条约”的签名簿上签了名。
    文章指出，在农民运动比较发展的地方，阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争很活跃。在千叶县，凡是展开了要求提高甘薯收购价格斗争的地方，也都展开了反对新“安全条约”的群众斗争。
    文章指出，农村中反对“安全条约”的政治斗争得到这样的发展，工人阶级对农民进行工作起了决定性作用。在反对修改“警察官职务执行法”和制订“勤务评定”制度斗争中建立起工农共同斗争组织的地方，都积极地展开了反对新“安全条约”的斗争。
    文章说，为了更有效地展开共同斗争，群马县已经成立“维护民主群马县县民联合会”。有些农村地区已经在镇和村建立起反对“安全条约”的组织。
