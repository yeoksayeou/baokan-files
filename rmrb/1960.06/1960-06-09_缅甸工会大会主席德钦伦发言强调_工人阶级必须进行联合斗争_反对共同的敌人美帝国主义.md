Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Thakin Lwin, Chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, spoke at the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions on the afternoon of the 7th.

Thakin Lwin said that U.S. imperialism and its servants, the national traitors, fear the unity of the working class on a national scale and international solidarity. Because after the First World War, the Soviet working people buried imperialism and the system of human exploitation on one-sixth of the world's land. After the Second World War, the working people of the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries not only buried imperialism in their countries, but also achieved development in all aspects. These things shocked them and caused them fear. They know that because the working people who account for one-third of the earth have established unbreakable close unity, it is the death knell for their exploitation rights in the remaining areas to be lost sooner or later. Therefore, they are doing their best to undermine the international unity of the working people.

He said that today, many workers in capitalist countries, whether they participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions or not, and workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries, are confident that they will bury imperialism with the united strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and believe that only the working class can lead the construction of socialist countries like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, where the system of human exploitation has been abolished and complete independence has been achieved. The more workers believe this, the less stable imperialism will be.

He said that imperialism slanders socialist countries as engaging in aggression, using this as an excuse to carry out smear propaganda against socialist countries, organize military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and sign military treaties to establish military bases and missile bases in the neighboring countries of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. U.S. imperialism sends troops to these countries to station and control them, threatening world peace.

Thakin Lwin emphasized that if the workers do not thoroughly eliminate imperialism, then it is clear that imperialism will inevitably use any means to deceive and exploit the workers, and will massacre the people who are fighting for liberation from their rule. Therefore, the working people of the world need to take further steps to thoroughly eliminate imperialism. We firmly believe that the World Federation of Trade Unions is holding this Council meeting in order to further strive for such steps.

Thakin Lwin said that we declare that the working people of Burma fully support the just and arduous struggle of the working people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and for national liberation. He said that U.S. imperialism continues to carry out aggression and provocations, and the U.S. invading troops have not yet withdrawn from Taiwan, South Korea, South Vietnam, and Japan. What is even more blatant is that on the eve of the summit conference of great powers convened according to the wishes of the people of the world, U.S. imperialists sent U-2 spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, thus disrupting the summit conference. The shameless U.S. imperialism also used such planes to invade the airspace of the People's Republic of China and Cuba. From this, it can be seen that although imperialism says it wants to negotiate for peace, it has never relaxed its aggressive activities and provocations. This shows that they have no sincerity for peace, and they will never give up aggressive provocations and espionage activities. Consultation and negotiation are necessary conditions for peace, but only with a sincere desire for peace can consultation and negotiation be effective. For U.S. imperialism and its servants, who are already engaged in massacre and want to launch wars, consultation and negotiation are merely to decorate themselves. What is very important here is the brilliant struggle against imperialism that we are waging, which is based on our efforts and loyalty to proletarian internationalism. This cannot be ignored. Whenever imperialism engages in aggressive activities, the masses of workers must severely condemn and oppose them. The Burmese working people believe that although we workers have different political views, languages, and skin colors, we must consistently carry out a united struggle against the common enemy of the working class, U.S. imperialism and its servants.

He said that the people of Burma are vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism, and one of the outstanding issues in our history is left over by imperialism. This issue is none other than the Sino-Burmese border issue. When the Chinese working people became the masters of the country, the Burmese people were also vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism. The government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Union of Burma signed an agreement on the border issue in January 1960, based on the Five Principles of U Nu and Zhou Enlai. In addition, a treaty of friendship and non-aggression was signed, which is a great milestone in the history of friendly relations between the Chinese and Burmese working people. This is not only a victory for the working people of China and Burma, but also a victory for the working people of Asia, Africa, and the world, and it shattered a conspiracy that imperialism attempted to create.

In his speech, he also expressed his full support for the report made by the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions at this meeting.

### 缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦发言强调  工人阶级必须进行联合斗争  反对共同的敌人美帝国主义

    缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦发言强调
    工人阶级必须进行联合斗争  反对共同的敌人美帝国主义
    新华社8日讯　缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦7日下午在世界工会联合会第十一次理事会会议上发言。
    德钦伦说，美帝国主义及其仆从者、民族叛徒害怕工人阶级在全国范围内的团结和国际团结。因为第一次世界大战后，苏联劳动人民在占世界六分之一的土地上，埋葬了帝国主义和人剥削人的制度。第二次世界大战后，中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的劳动人民，不仅在他们的国家埋葬了帝国主义，而且在各方面获得发展。这些，震动了他们，引起了他们的恐惧。他们知道，由于占地球三分之一的劳动人民建立了牢不可破的亲密团结，是他们在其余地区剥削权迟早要丧失的丧钟。因此他们极力破坏劳动人民的国际团结。
    他说，今天，许多参加世界工联或未参加世界工联的资本主义国家的工人，殖民地、半殖民地国家的工人有信心，将以世界工联的工人团结力量埋葬帝国主义，并且相信，只有工人阶级才能领导建成像苏联和中华人民共和国那样的社会主义国家，在这些国家里废除了人剥削人的制度并获得完全的独立。工人越相信这点，帝国主义就站不住脚。
    他说，帝国主义诽谤社会主义国家将进行侵略，以此为借口，对社会主义国家进行污蔑宣传，组织北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织等军事集团，签订军事条约，在苏联和中华人民共和国的邻国建立军事基地和导弹基地。美帝国主义派军队驻扎在这些国家并进行控制，威胁着世界和平。
    德钦伦强调指出，如果工人不彻底肃清帝国主义，那么很明显，帝国主义必将不择手段欺骗和剥削工人，将屠杀从他们统治下争取解放的人们。因此，全世界劳动人民需要进一步采取步骤，彻底肃清帝国主义。我们坚信世界工联是为了进一步争取步骤才召开这次理事会会议的。
    德钦伦说，我们宣布，缅甸的劳动人民完全支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家劳动人民进一步反对帝国主义，争取民族解放而进行的正义和艰巨的斗争。他说，美帝国主义继续进行着侵略和挑衅，美国侵略军队还未从台湾、南朝鲜、南越、日本撤出去。尤其更加明目张胆的是：在根据全世界人民的愿望而召开的大国首脑会议前夕，美帝国主义者派遣U—2间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，因而使首脑会议遭到破坏。无耻的美帝国主义也使用这种飞机侵犯中华人民共和国和古巴的领空。由此可见，帝国主义虽然口头上说为了和平要进行协商谈判，实际上从未放松其侵略活动和挑衅。这说明他们没有任何和平的诚意，他们永远不会放弃侵略性的挑衅和间谍活动。协商谈判是和平的必要条件，但有了真诚的和平愿望，协商谈判才能有效果。协商谈判在本来就进行屠杀、要发动战争的美帝国主义及其仆从来说，不过是为了装饰自己而已。这里十分重要的是我们所进行的辉煌的反对帝国主义的斗争，这个斗争基于我们的努力和对无产阶级国际主义的忠诚。这是不能忽视的。每当帝国主义进行侵略活动时，工人群众必须要严厉地谴责和反对。缅甸劳动人民认为，我们工人虽然有不同的政治见解、语言和肤色，但是在反对工人阶级的共同敌人美帝国主义及其仆从的斗争，必须一贯地进行联合斗争。
    他说，缅甸人民对帝国主义的阴谋保持着警惕，我们存在的历史上悬而未决的一个问题是帝国主义遗留下来的。这个问题不是别的，就是中缅边界问题。在中国劳动人民成为国家的主人的时候，缅甸人民也在对帝国主义阴谋保持警惕。中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦政府根据吴努—周恩来五项原则，于1960年1月签订了边界问题协定。此外，还签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，这是中缅劳动人民友好历史上伟大的里程碑。这不仅是中缅两国劳动人民的胜利，也是亚非和全世界劳动人民的胜利，它粉碎了帝国主义企图制造的一个阴谋。
    他在发言中还表示完全支持世界工联总书记在这次会议上所作的报告。
