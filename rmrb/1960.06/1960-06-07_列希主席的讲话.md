Chairman Lezdi's Speech

Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi, dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear Comrades, esteemed Friends:

Please allow me, on behalf of the comrades accompanying me and in my own name, to express our heartfelt gratitude to you for attending this reception, and once again extend our deep gratitude to the great Chinese people and their leaders for the sincere feelings and friendship shown to us during our visit to your beautiful country.

Respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi, we have come to the People's Republic of China for a friendly visit at your invitation. Your people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are advancing with truly heroic strides. We are witnesses to this event. Thanks to the revolutionary Great Leap Forward, selfless spirit and heroism, and amazing drive, the Chinese people can now accomplish in months or days what used to take years. They are making rivers give way, turning the land into a prosperous garden, and rapidly developing industry and culture. These victories prove the correctness of the Chinese idiom: "With one heart and one mind, we can move mountains and fill the seas."

Comrade Hoxha once said: "We regard the brilliant achievements of the People's Republic of China as our own achievements. These achievements are a great contribution to further consolidating the unity of our socialist camp and to our socialist and peaceful cause. Our people, our People's Republic, are proud to have such a great and loyal friend as the People's Republic of China and the talented and capable Chinese people." The People's Republic of China has become a powerful socialist country, and its position in the international arena has greatly increased. It is completely incomprehensible and intolerable that the great People's Republic of China does not yet occupy its legitimate and deserved seat in the United Nations. Without the active participation of the People's Republic of China and the enjoyment of complete and equal rights, how can we solve the major international issues of great concern to all mankind today, safeguard the peace and security of all peoples, address the issue of disarmament, and conduct beneficial international cooperation between countries?

Our common and dear friends, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Albania, other fraternal socialist countries, and all peace-loving countries, have consistently and resolutely supported the restoration of the legitimate rights that have been barbarously deprived by imperialism, especially by US imperialism. They severely condemn this absurd and hostile stance of US imperialism and angrily reject their unfounded sophistry and propaganda.

The People's Republic of Albania has supported and will always support the unification of the friendly Chinese people with their great and glorious motherland—Taiwan, which is a sacred and indivisible part of the People's Republic of China.

Dear Comrades, Friends:

Our two countries are members of the great socialist camp. The leading force of this camp is the glorious Soviet Union, which today has become a huge and indestructible force. The historically significant victories achieved by the Soviet people in all fields, and the amazing achievements in science and technology—artificial earth satellites, lunar satellites, and Soviet rockets—not only make the people of socialist countries, but also the peace-loving people of the world, infinitely happy, because the Soviet Union today is a steel-like barrier of freedom and world peace and the main factor in preventing the imperialists from realizing their aggressive plans. From the birth of the first socialist country, from Lenin's Decree on Peace, the Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely fought for peace and friendship among all peoples. Since its establishment, the Soviet state has resolutely supported the struggle of people all over the world for freedom. The Soviet people have waged a historic struggle not only for their own motherland, but also to save all mankind from fascist aggression and for the liberation and prosperity of all people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union resolutely participated in the struggle to defend Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq from aggression, forcing the imperialists to flee with their tails between their legs, and consistently defended the rights of the people of dependent and semi-dependent countries. Do not all these and countless other well-known historical facts prove this point? The Soviet Union is the bastion of socialism and communism, and it has played and continues to play a very significant role in the international revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's words are unforgettable: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China."

Like all other socialist countries, our two countries firmly support the Soviet Union's peaceful policy of defending peace, preventing a new world war (which, under the conditions of thermonuclear weapons, would bring devastating disasters to all peoples), peaceful coexistence, disarmament, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, normalizing the situation in West Berlin, and establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe and Asia. Recently, the important proposal for disarmament put forward by Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Soviet Government—to destroy the means of delivering nuclear weapons and to abolish military bases in foreign countries—is a new proof of the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace. There is no doubt that it will be supported by all peace-loving countries. However, the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, are undermining the Soviet Union's correct proposals for defending peace and disarmament. They are engaged in an arms race, arming German and Japanese militarists, and carrying out provocative and aggressive activities against socialist countries.

We, like other socialist countries and the progressive mankind of the world, firmly condemn the aggressive act of American spy planes violating Soviet sovereignty and the imperialist, blatant policy of aggression formally announced by Eisenhower and his government, and unanimously support Comrade Khrushchev's statement. The Soviet Union and our countries will continue to strive to defend peace and resolve international disputes through negotiations. However, on the other hand, we have been and will always be vigilant, ready at any time to give a due rebuff to all aggressors who dare to undermine the freedom and rights of the people of our countries.

Dear Comrades,

Albania is the smallest country in the socialist camp, and in the past it was one of the most backward countries in Europe. In the short span of years since liberation, it has made unprecedented achievements. Hundreds of factories, joint factories, and hydroelectric power stations have been built in our country, agricultural collectivization has almost been completed, the swamps of the past have now become prosperous gardens, and a large network of schools and cultural institutions has been established, and the living standards of the working people have been greatly improved. Our people have been able to achieve these victories because of their selfless efforts, the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership headed by Comrade Hoxha, and the selfless assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. Today, the international prestige of the People's Republic of Albania has increased unprecedentedly, and Albania has become a factor of peace and stability in the Balkans. The sovereignty and independence of the People's Republic of Albania are inviolable, because today the masters of our country are free people, because our country has powerful friends: the great Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries. Comrade Khrushchev stated during his visit to Albania last year: Whoever dares to invade Albania is invading the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.

As pointed out by Comrade Hoxha, the leader of the Albanian Party and people, without the glorious Soviet Union, the Albanian people would never have been able to liberate their country, defend their independence, and achieve these brilliant achievements in building a happy socialist life. Therefore, the Albanian people consolidate their friendship with the Soviet Union and will protect it like their own lives.

Little Albania is a great example of what a nation can achieve when it frees itself from slavery and embarks on the road of building socialism, when it has the leadership of a party loyal to Marxism-Leninism, and when it receives the great fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union.

Dear Comrades, Friends, the Albanian people highly value the fraternal assistance given to them by the great Chinese people. The fraternal assistance and consistent support given to Albania by the Soviet Union and People's China demonstrate to the world the new type of truly fraternal internationalist relations between socialist countries.

Deep friendship connects the people of our two countries. We are both members of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The common path and aspiration of building socialism and communism, and the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism and for the defense of peace, unite us together.

Under the leadership and teachings of its own Labor Party, the Albanian people will always hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, safeguard the unity of the socialist camp like protecting their own eyes, and continue to carry out a principled struggle to thoroughly expose the enemies of our country, the running dogs fostered by aggressive US imperialism, and the dangerous enemies of Marxism-Leninism and the international revolutionary movement—the Yugoslavian revisionists.

The people of our two countries, united in the great socialist camp, are advancing towards victory in socialism and peace. The friendship between socialist countries is as strong as steel, and the unity of our camp is unbreakable. No force in the world can undermine our unity.

Comrades and friends, please raise your glasses:

To the eternal friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people,

To the heroic Chinese people,

To the Communist Party of China and its Chairman, Comrade Mao Zedong,

To the People's Republic of China and its Chairman, Comrade Liu Shaoqi,

To the unity of the socialist camp headed by our common great friend, the Soviet Union,

To the victory of world peace,

Cheers!

### 列希主席的讲话

专栏：

    列希主席的讲话亲爱的刘少奇同志，亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们，尊敬的朋友们：
    请允许我代表陪同我的同志并以我个人的名义衷心的感谢你们出席这个招待会，并再一次向伟大的中国人民及其领袖在我们访问你们美丽的国家期间，对我们所表示的真挚的感情和友谊致以深切的谢意。
    尊敬的刘少奇同志，我们应你的邀请来到中华人民共和国进行友好访问。你们的人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下正以真正的豪迈步伐向前迈进。我们是这一事件的见证人。由于革命的大跃进、忘我的精神和英雄主义、惊人的干劲，中国人民现在几个月或几天内就能实现过去需要几年才能办到的事。他们正在使河水让路，把大地变成繁荣的花园，正在迅速地发展着工业和文化。这些胜利证明了中国的这句成语的正确性：“众志成城，移山填海。”
    霍查同志曾经说过：“我们把中华人民共和国的光辉成就看成是我们自己的成就，这些成就对进一步巩固我们社会主义阵营的团结，对我们的社会主义事业和和平事业是一个伟大的贡献。我国人民，我们的人民共和国，为有像中华人民共和国和天才而又能干的中国人民这样的伟大的忠实朋友而自豪。”中华人民共和国已经成了一个强大的社会主义国家，它在国际范围内的地位大大提高。伟大的中华人民共和国在联合国组织中还没有占有自己合法的应得席位，这是完全不可理解和不能容忍的。如果没有中华人民共和国的积极的参加和享有完全平等的权利，又怎么能解决今天全人类所密切关心的重大国际问题、保卫各国人民的和平和安全问题、裁军问题和各国之间进行有益的国际合作问题呢？
    我们共同的亲爱的朋友苏联、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、其他社会主义兄弟国家和一切爱好和平的国家，过去和现在一直坚决支持恢复被帝国主义，特别是被美帝国主义野蛮剥夺了的合法权利。严厉谴责美帝国主义的这种荒谬和敌对的立场，并且愤怒地拒绝他们的毫无根据的狡辩和宣传。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国过去支持，将来也永远支持友好的中国人民统一自己伟大的光荣祖国——中华人民共和国的神圣不可分割的一部分——台湾。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们两国都是伟大的社会主义阵营的成员。这一阵营的领导力量是光荣的苏联，它今天成了一支巨大的不可摧毁的力量。苏联人民在各个方面所取得的具有世界历史意义的胜利，在科学技术方面所取得的惊人成就，人造地球卫星、月球卫星和苏联火箭不仅使社会主义阵营各国人民，而且使全世界爱好和平的人民群众无限欢欣鼓舞，因为苏联今天是自由和世界和平的钢铁般的屏障，是制止帝国主义者实现他们的侵略计划的主要因素。从第一个社会主义国家诞生之日起，从列宁的和平法令开始，苏联始终不渝地坚决为各国人民之间的和平和友谊进行斗争。苏维埃国家从它成立之日起，就坚决支持世界各国人民争取自由的斗争。苏联人民不仅为了自己的祖国，而且为了挽救全人类免受法西斯的侵略，为了各人民民主国家的解放和繁荣，进行了具有历史意义的斗争。苏联坚决参加了保卫埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克免受侵略的斗争，迫使帝国主义者夹着尾巴逃窜，始终不渝地保卫着附属国和半附属国家的人民的权利。所有这些以及其他人所共知的数以千百计的历史事实不正证明了这一点吗？苏联是社会主义和共产主义的堡垒，它过去和现在一直对国际革命起着非常巨大的作用。毛泽东同志的话是令人难忘的：“十月革命一声炮响给中国送来了马克思列宁主义”。
    像其他所有社会主义国家一样，我们两国坚决支持苏联保卫和平、制止新的世界大战（在有热核武器的条件下新的世界大战将给各国人民带来毁灭性的灾难）、和平共处、裁减军备、缔结对德和约、使西柏林的局势正常化、在欧洲和亚洲建立无原子武器地区的和平政策。最近，苏联政府主席赫鲁晓夫同志所提出的裁减军备的重要建议——销毁运载核武器的运送工具，取消在外国的军事基地，是苏联一贯的和平政策的新证明。毫无疑问，它将得到所有爱好和平国家的支持。但是，帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者正在破坏苏联的保卫和平和裁减军备的正确建议。它们正在进行军备竞赛，武装德国和日本军国主义者，并对社会主义国家进行挑衅和侵略活动。
    我们，像其他社会主义国家和世界全体进步人类一样，坚决谴责美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联主权的侵略行为和艾森豪威尔及其政府正式宣布的帝国主义的、明目张胆的侵略政策，一致支持拥护赫鲁晓夫同志的声明。苏联和我们这些国家将继续为保卫和平，为通过谈判解决国际争端而努力。但是，另一方面，我们过去和今后将永远保持警惕，随时准备给敢于破坏我们这些国家人民的自由和权利的一切侵略者以应有的回击。
    亲爱的同志们，
    阿尔巴尼亚是社会主义阵营最小的一个国家，过去它是欧洲最落后的国家之一。在解放以后的短短的这几年内，它取得了史无前例的成就。在我们的国家里已建立了成百的工厂、联合工厂、水电站，农业集体化也差不多已经完成，过去的沼泽现在变成了繁荣的花园，建立了大批的学校和文化机关网，劳动人民的生活水平得到了大大提高。我国人民之所以能够取得这些胜利是因为他们进行了忘我的努力，有以霍查同志为首的马克思列宁主义式的正确领导，有社会主义国家首先是苏联的无私的援助。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际威望空前提高，阿尔巴尼亚成了巴尔干和平和稳定的因素。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的主权和独立是不可侵犯的，因为今天我国的主人是自由的人民，因为我国有强大的朋友伟大的苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家。赫鲁晓夫同志去年在阿尔巴尼亚访问的时候就曾声明：谁敢侵犯阿尔巴尼亚，就是侵犯苏联和整个社会主义阵营。
    正如阿尔巴尼亚党和人民的领袖霍查同志所指出的那样，没有光荣的苏联，阿尔巴尼亚人民就永远不能解放自己的国家，保卫自己的独立和在建设社会主义的幸福生活中取得这些辉煌的成就。因此阿尔巴尼亚人民巩固和苏联的友谊，并且将像保护生命一样保护它。
    小小的阿尔巴尼亚是一个伟大的范例，它说明，一个民族当它摆脱了奴役走上建设社会主义的道路，当它有了忠实于马克思列宁主义的党的领导，当它得到苏联的巨大的兄弟般的援助的时候能够取得什么样的成就。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大的中国人民给予他们的兄弟般的援助给以崇高的评价。苏联、人民中国给予阿尔巴尼亚的兄弟般的援助和一贯的支持向全世界说明了社会主义国家之间的新型的真正兄弟般的国际主义关系。
    深厚的友谊将我们两国人民连在一起，我们都是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的成员，建设社会主义和共产主义的共同道路和愿望，反对帝国主义和修正主义，保卫和平的共同斗争把我们团结在一起。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的劳动党的领导和教导下将永远高高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，像保卫眼珠一样保卫社会主义阵营的团结，继续为彻底揭露我们国家的敌人、侵略成性的美帝国主义所豢养的走狗、马克思列宁主义和国际革命运动的危险敌人——南斯拉夫修正主义者进行原则性的斗争。
    团结在伟大的社会主义阵营中的我们两国人民正向着社会主义和和平的胜利前进。社会主义国家之间的友谊坚强如钢，我们阵营的团结牢不可破，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏我们的团结。
    同志们和朋友们请大家举杯：
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民的永恒的友谊，
    为英雄的中国人民，
    为中国共产党和其主席毛泽东同志，
    为中华人民共和国和其主席刘少奇同志，
    为以我们共同的伟大朋友苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，
    为世界和平的胜利，
    干杯！
