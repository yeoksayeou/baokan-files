National Cities Hold Mass Demonstrations Against U.S. Imperialism
Vow Not to Rest Until U.S. Bandits are Driven Away and Taiwan is Liberated
Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an Militiamen Express:
Remain Vigilant at All Times, Resolutely Repulse American Imperialism
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 27th: More than 30,000 militiamen in Shenyang held a demonstration and rally against U.S. imperialism this afternoon.

Carrying various weapons and equipment, the militia teams marched in neat and imposing formations, singing "We Must Liberate Taiwan," and converged on Zhongshan Square from all districts of the city. Instantly, it became an ocean of militiamen.

Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Political Commissar of the Shenyang Militia, addressed the militia ranks. He said: The people of Shenyang, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's policies of war and aggression, and are determined to defend world peace. Jiao Ruoyu pointed out that for ten years, U.S. imperialism has been stepping up its war preparations in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, directly using force to obstruct our people's liberation of Taiwan, and constantly carrying out military provocations against our mainland, threatening our security, and undermining Asian and world peace. He said: We must liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.

Jiao Ruoyu then pointed out that we love peace, and our social system dictates that we will not occupy an inch of anyone else's territory, but we are not afraid of war. But U.S. imperialism, while occupying our territory of Taiwan, is also trying its best to support the resurgence of Japanese militarism. The people of Shenyang have fresh memories of the cruel oppression of Japanese imperialism fourteen years ago and the atrocities of the U.S. imperialism's puppet Chiang Kai-shek clique. We will never lose the slightest vigilance and are always ready to fight to the end for the liberation of our motherland's territory of Taiwan and against U.S. imperialism's aggression.

Subsequently, representatives of workers, peasants, students, and cadres of the militia spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously expressed that they would transform their boundless hatred for U.S. imperialism into a huge force, actively participate in militia construction and militia training, increase their vigilance a hundredfold, and be ready at any time to severely strike at the aggressors who dare to launch a war against our country.

After the meeting, the militia队伍 held a demonstration parade in three routes.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 27th: More than 40,000 militiamen in Wuhan held a massive anti-American armed demonstration today, opposing U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of our territory Taiwan and expressing the determination of the people of the city to liberate Taiwan.

The fully armed militia队伍, composed of workers, peasants, students, street residents, and others, poured into the square on Jiefang Avenue from early morning. The slogans "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "U.S. Imperialism, Get Out of Taiwan!" rose and fell, turning the square into a sea of ​​anger.

Chen Yixin, member of the Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Governor of Hubei Province, Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Minghao, Chen Jingshe, and Wang Haishan, Vice Governors of Hubei Province, Yang Qing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Tang Xing, Tang Wuyuan, Xiong Fei, and Hua Yuqing, Vice Mayors of Wuhan, and Zhang Guangcai, Major General of the Wuhan Garrison, all attended the meeting. Soviet experts in Wuhan and the Japanese Socialist Party agricultural delegation led by Takeshi Takeuchi, who are visiting Wuhan, also attended the meeting.

Liu Huinong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Political Commissar of the Hubei Hankou Military Sub-district, first spoke amidst warm applause. He strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan and its heinous plot to create "two Chinas." He called on all militiamen to maintain high vigilance and make full preparations. If U.S. imperialism, this war maniac, dares to launch a war of aggression, we will give U.S. imperialism a fatal blow.

Subsequently, Xiao Shujia, representative of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company militia, Tong Jinlan, representative of the Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory militia instructor who attended the National Militia Representative Conference, and Huang Wenguo, battalion commander of the "August 1st" farm militia of Guanshan Commune in the suburbs of Wuhan, spoke at the meeting.

After the meeting, the militiamen held a grand demonstration parade. The militiamen of the Wuhan Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, participated in the demonstration parade carrying heavy machine guns. In recent days, they have been stepping up military training after successfully completing their production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 27th: More than 20,000 militiamen in Guangzhou held a demonstration against U.S. imperialism at the East Parade Ground this morning. Armed workers, peasants, students, and cadres of institutions raised their fists and shouted in unison for U.S. imperialism to get out of Taiwan.

This morning, the militia队伍 from factories, schools, communes, and institutions, carrying various weapons, marched in imposing and orderly steps toward the East Parade Ground.

Consuls of various brotherly countries stationed in Guangzhou and foreign friends were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting began at 8:50 a.m. Huang Ronghai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Guangzhou Militia, delivered the opening remarks. He said that the Chinese people will never forget that on this day ten years ago, on the third day of launching the Korean War, U.S. imperialism openly sent a fleet to occupy our territory of Taiwan. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan.

Xue Yan, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Political Commissar of the Guangzhou Militia Headquarters, said at the meeting that U.S. imperialism has committed heinous crimes in Taiwan for ten years. U.S. imperialism has also used Taiwan to constantly invade our territory and airspace. A few days ago, the number one war monger Eisenhower went to Taiwan again to create tension. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war, and are determined to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace.

Militia representatives of workers, peasants, and students unanimously expressed at the meeting that they would step up the socialist construction of the motherland, strive to improve their combat skills, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland to liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan.

The meeting ended in the majestic military music of the "Militia March," and the fully armed militiamen marched out of the venue in high spirits and held a demonstration parade.

At various rallies held by more than 100,000 militiamen in various districts and counties, many former volunteer army combat heroes told stories of their heroic deeds in defeating the U.S. invading army on the Korean battlefield. Liu Bingcheng, a former volunteer army combat hero and battalion commander of the militia camp of the Southwest Agricultural College, said at the rally: "U.S. imperialism is still赖在 South Korea and is occupying our territory of Taiwan, constantly carrying out military provocations against our country. We must increase our vigilance a hundredfold and be ready at any time to fight to the end to smash U.S. imperialism's aggression and defend world peace." Zou Hongcai, the person in charge of Huangjueya Management District of Pushan People's Commune in Nan'an District, who attended the first National Militia Representative Conference, said at the rally held by the militiamen that we must step up training, usually participate actively in the socialist construction of the production army, and pick up guns to cooperate with the national defense army to attack and eliminate the enemy during wartime.

In recent days, various militia divisions and regiments in Chongqing have held rallies and demonstrations against U.S. imperialism. Today, militiamen from Shapingba, Jiulongpo, Beibei, Nantong, Changshou and other districts and counties carried various weapons and huge banners to hold demonstrations.
