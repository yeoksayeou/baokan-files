Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st -- The "Da Bao Kang" ship sent by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese left Jakarta this afternoon to return to China. On board were a group of displaced overseas Chinese from Central Java, as well as some impoverished overseas Chinese from Jakarta.

The more than 400 displaced overseas Chinese from various parts of Central Java lost their livelihoods due to the Indonesian authorities' ban on foreign retail vendors. When they left their original places of residence, Indonesian friends reluctantly bid them farewell. When they gathered in Semarang, the capital of Central Java, a farewell party was held for these overseas Chinese preparing to return home on June 11, under the auspices of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association of Semarang. The chairman of the association, former Mayor of Semarang, Abdul Majid, said in his speech that overseas Chinese have worked together with the Indonesian people to build and make Indonesia prosperous, and they have made great contributions to Indonesia. He pointed out that, however, those with ulterior motives slander the overseas Chinese economy as a "remnant of colonialism," and they attempt to deceive the Indonesian people in this way and sow discord between the people of the two countries.

A letter of farewell to these overseas Chinese from a trade union organization was also read at the meeting. This organization, representing its 300,000 Indonesian workers, wished the overseas Chinese a safe journey and extended greetings to the fraternal Chinese workers.

Young men and women and children of Indonesia, as well as representatives of various people's organizations headed by Mrs. Rustamadji, the widow of the late chairman of the Semarang Indonesia-China Friendship Association, presented flowers and gifts to the overseas Chinese preparing to return home and to overseas Chinese organizations.

Zhao Zhengyi, counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, embassy staff, and representatives of overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta were present at the port today to see off the returning overseas Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency -- More than 680 overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia arrived in Kunming from Zhanjiang on the 14th and 15th, and were warmly welcomed and kindly received by Wang Zhaoming, deputy director of the Yunnan Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and more than 1,000 people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Kunming.

This group of overseas Chinese returned on the "Da Bao Kang" ship, and they came from East Java, West Java, and Central Java. After powerful groups in Indonesia stirred up anti-China and discriminatory activities, these overseas Chinese compatriots were first forced to become unemployed and then subjected to forced relocation by force, and their lives fell into very miserable circumstances. Many people had almost nothing but a few changes of clothes when they returned home. According to a survey of 157 overseas Chinese from the Bandung area, they had only 93 pieces of luggage.

Xinhua News Agency -- The "National Committee for Promoting Red Flag Emulation Among Returned Overseas Chinese, Relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Returned Overseas Chinese Students" was formally established on the 15th. Fang Fang, deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, was appointed as the director. Zhuang Mingli, deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and Lin Deshi, an advanced returned overseas Chinese producer attending the National Congress of Heroes, were appointed as deputy directors. There are nineteen members in total.

The initiative to launch a red flag emulation campaign among returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, and to establish an organization to lead this campaign, was proposed at the Fourth Session of the First All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in December 1959. At present, the emulation movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and leading the backward has been enthusiastically launched among returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in various places.

    印度尼西亚人民欢送华侨回国
    指责别有用心的人诬蔑华侨企图在两国人民间散布不和
    我全国归侨侨眷归国侨生红旗竞赛促进委员会成立
    据新华社雅加达21日电　中国政府派来接运华侨的“大宝康”号轮船今天下午离开雅加达回国。搭乘这艘轮船回国的有中爪哇一批流离失所的华侨，以及一些雅加达贫困的华侨。
    来自中爪哇各地的四百多名流离失所的华侨是由于印度尼西亚当局禁止外侨小商贩营业而丧失生计的。当他们离开原居留地的时候，印度尼西亚朋友们都依依不舍地和他们告别。当他们在中爪哇首府三宝垄集合的时候，在三宝垄印度尼西亚—中国友好协会的主持下，6月11日为这些准备归国的华侨举行了欢送会。协会主席、前三宝垄市长阿卜杜勒马吉德在会上致词时说，华侨和印度尼西亚人民共同努力建设并使印度尼西亚繁荣，他们对印度尼西亚作出了很大的贡献。他指出，但是，那些别有用心的人诬蔑华侨的经济是“殖民主义的残余”，他们企图以这种办法来欺骗印度尼西亚人民，并在两国人民之间散布不和。
    在会上还宣读了一个工会组织为这些华侨送别的信件。这个组织代表它所属的三十万印度尼西亚工人，祝华侨一路平安，并向兄弟般的中国工人致意。
    印度尼西亚的男女青年和儿童以及三宝垄印度尼西亚—中国友好协会已故主席的夫人鲁斯塔马吉德夫人为首的各人民团体的代表向准备归国的华侨和华侨团体献花和赠送礼物。
    今天到港口为归国华侨送行的有中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆参赞赵政一，大使馆的工作人员，以及雅加达华侨团体的代表等。
    据新华社讯　六百八十多名从印度尼西亚回国的华侨，14日和15日由湛江到达昆明，受到了云南省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任、云南省归国华侨联合会主席王昭明和昆明市各族各界一千多人的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。
    这批华侨是乘坐“大宝康”号轮船归国的，他们来自东爪哇、西爪哇和中爪哇地区。这些侨胞在印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起反华排华活动后，先是被迫失业，后又遭到武力逼迁，生活陷于非常悲惨的境地，许多人回国时除了几件换洗的衣服外，几乎一无所有。据来自万隆地区的一百五十七名侨胞的调查，他们带的行李只有九十三件。
    据新华社讯　“全国归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生红旗竞赛促进委员会”15日正式成立。由华侨事务委员会副主任、全国侨联副主席方方任主任，华侨事务委员会副主任，全国侨联副主席庄明理和出席全国群英会的归侨先进生产者林德时为副主任，委员共有十九人。
    在归侨、侨眷、归国华侨学生中开展红旗竞赛，并成立领导这个竞赛的机构的创议，是在1959年12月全国侨联一届四次会议上提出的。目前，学先进、赶先进、超先进、带后进的竞赛运动，已在各地归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生中热烈展开。
