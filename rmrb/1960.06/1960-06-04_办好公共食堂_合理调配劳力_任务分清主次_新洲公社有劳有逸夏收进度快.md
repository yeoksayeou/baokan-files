Run Public Canteens Well, Rationally Allocate Labor, Clearly Distinguish Between Primary and Secondary Tasks
Xinzhou Commune Achieves Fast Summer Harvest Progress With Labor and Rest
(Reported by our newspaper) During the busy farming season of summer harvesting, planting, and management intertwined, the Xinzhou United Management District of Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, insisted on running public canteens well to improve the lives of its members, adhered to the principle of "combining work and rest," and rationally arranged labor, so that the vast number of members ate well, worked well, and rested well.

During the summer harvest and planting period, the thirty-six canteens in this management district generally achieved diverse meals and clean dining rooms; each canteen established a vegetable base, and the vast majority of canteens were able to achieve a continuous supply of fresh vegetables with a surplus; thirty-one canteens established pig farms, raising more than two hundred pigs in total. On the eve of the summer harvest, the management district and production teams held meetings to specifically discuss and arrange the members' lives and welfare. Leading cadres of the management district and production teams went to the canteens to study with the cooks on how to run the canteens well and improve living standards. Before the wheat harvest, each canteen made full preparations in advance. During the tense rush harvest, each canteen provided rice, noodles, steamed buns, and pancakes, as well as fresh vegetables, every day.

The Party General Branch of the management district emphasized caring for the health of the masses when comprehensively arranging busy farming activities. In order to resolve the contradiction between busy farming and labor shortages, the Party General Branch and each branch educated production team and small team cadres to learn to scientifically arrange production and rationally allocate labor, requiring them to be busy but not chaotic, and to avoid working overtime as much as possible. The entire management district also unified the summer harvest and planting work into four major items: harvesting, planting, management, and logistics (i.e., life and welfare). Then, based on the harvesting and planting conditions and task size of each production team, they distinguished between urgency and primary and secondary tasks, properly arranged labor, and comprehensively established a responsibility system. After these methods were implemented, the enthusiasm of the vast number of members for labor was even higher. When the entire district decided to launch a major wheat harvesting campaign, all of the district's more than two thousand male and female semi-able-bodied laborers attended, and 4.8 million mu of wheat were basically harvested in just two days, achieving simultaneous cutting, bundling, transportation, and timely threshing into warehouses. As soon as the harvest ended, they followed up by weeding the first round of 2,900 mu of cotton planted on wheat stubble, and more than 4,000 mu of early rice was also cultivated very well.

    办好公共食堂　合理调配劳力　任务分清主次
    新洲公社有劳有逸夏收进度快
    本报讯　湖北省新洲县新洲公社联合管理区在夏季收、种、管相交错的农忙中，坚持办好公共食堂改善社员生活，坚持执行“劳逸结合”，合理安排劳动力，使广大社员吃得好，劳动好，休息好。
    在夏收夏种期间，这个管理区的三十六个食堂，普遍作到了饭菜多样，餐厅整洁；个个食堂都建立了蔬菜基地，绝大多数食堂都能作到蔬菜新陈相接，自给有余；有三十一个办起了食堂养猪场，共养猪二百多头。夏收前夕，管理区和各生产队先后召开会议，专门讨论和具体安排了社员的生活福利。管理区和生产队的领导干部分头深入到各个食堂，同炊事员一起研究如何办好食堂改善生活的具体办法。割麦以前，各个食堂都事先做了充分的准备，抢收紧张时，各个食堂做到每天有米饭，有面条，有馍有粑，有新鲜蔬菜。
    管理区党总支在全面安排农忙活路时，特别强调关怀群众的健康。为了解决农忙与劳动力紧张的矛盾，党总支和各支部教育生产队和小队干部要学会科学地安排生产，合理调配劳动力，要求作到忙而不乱，尽量避免加班加点。全管理区还把夏收夏种的活路统一分成收、种、管和后勤（即生活福利）四大项，再根据各生产队的收种情况和任务大小，分清缓急和主次，妥善地安排劳力，并全面建立责任制度。这些办法实行以后，广大社员的劳动积极性更加高涨，当全区决定割麦大突击时，全区二千多男女整半劳动力全部出勤，四千八百万亩小麦，仅两天就基本抢收完毕，并做到了边割、边捆、边运，及时脱粒入仓。收割刚结束，紧跟着又将二千九百多亩麦茬棉花，锄完了头道草，四千多亩早稻也培育得很好。
