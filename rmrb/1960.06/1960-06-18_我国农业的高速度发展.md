The issue of construction speed is the most important one facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution. The purpose of our revolution is to develop social productive forces as quickly as possible. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the development of China's national economy should be based on agriculture and guided by industry, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. High-speed agricultural development is the central link in the high-speed, proportionate development of China's national economy.

Our country's agricultural development has always been very rapid, which fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country's agricultural development speed has been very high. During the period of national economic recovery, thanks to the Party's correct policies on agriculture and the completion of the reform of the feudal land system, rural productive forces were liberated, and agricultural production was rapidly restored and developed. By 1952, the total agricultural output value reached 48.39 billion yuan (calculated at constant 1952 prices), an increase of 48.5% compared with 1949. The output of major agricultural products had been restored and exceeded the pre-war production level. Total grain output reached 308.8 billion jin, and total cotton output reached 26.07 million dan.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, with the launch of China's large-scale planned economic construction and the victorious completion of agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production further developed. In 1957, the total agricultural output value reached 60.35 billion yuan (calculated at constant 1952 prices), an increase of 24.7% compared with 1952, the total grain output reached 370 billion jin, and the total cotton output reached 32.8 million dan.

In the first two years of the Second Five-Year Plan, thanks to the great victories achieved in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and the realization of people's communes in the rural areas, agricultural production achieved continuous leaps forward unprecedented in Chinese history. By 1959, the total agricultural output value and the total output of grain and cotton had all triumphantly overfulfilled the targets set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The total agricultural output value reached 78.3 billion yuan (calculated at constant 1957 prices), an increase of 45.8% compared with 1957, with an average annual increase of 20.7%. Grain increased by an average of 20.8% per year, and cotton by an average of 21.2% per year. The agricultural development speed in 1958 and 1959 showed that China's agriculture is fully capable of leaping forward at a higher speed than during the period of national economic recovery and the First Five-Year Plan. It also showed that China's agricultural development has entered a new historical period.

In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the total agricultural output value has increased by 1.7 times, with an average annual increase of 10.4%. The total grain output has increased by 1.5 times, with an average annual increase of 9.6%; the total cotton output has increased by 4.4 times, with an average annual increase of 18.4%. Such a high rate of development fully proves the tremendous vitality and irrefutable superiority of China's socialist system.

Such a high rate of development was simply unimaginable in old China. The agricultural production in the years before the War of Resistance Against Japan was the best in old China, but the development speed was very low. For example, grain increased by an average of only 2.5% per year from 1931 to 1936; cotton increased by an average of only 2.8% per year from 1919 to 1936.

Such a high rate of agricultural development in China is also beyond the reach of capitalist countries. From 1950 to 1958, China's agriculture grew at an average rate of 9.8% per year, while the general growth rate of capitalist countries was only about 2%, less than a quarter of China's agricultural development speed. Take the United States, the most developed country in the capitalist world in terms of agriculture, for example. From 1950 to 1958, agriculture grew at an average rate of only 2.2% per year, and from 1953 to 1957, it grew at an average rate of only 1.1%. Even during the fastest period of agricultural development in the United States from 1860 to 1910, the average annual growth rate was only about 2.5%. This speed is far lower than the development speed during China's First Five-Year Plan, and of course, cannot be compared with China's great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. Comparing the recent grain and cotton development speeds of China and major capitalist countries: from 1950 to 1958, the average annual growth rate of China's total grain output was 9.8%, which is nearly five times that of West Germany, more than four times that of Japan, nearly Four times that of the US and more than three times that of France; the UK's 1958 grain output not only did not increase compared to 1949, but decreased by 6.5%. During the same period, the average annual growth rate of China's cotton output was 18.8%, which is generally one or two times to several times faster than the growth rate of capitalist countries; the US cotton output in 1958 not only did not increase compared to 1949, but decreased by 28.1%.

The continuous leap forward on the agricultural front is the result of implementing the Party's General Line and realizing the people's communes.

China's high-speed agricultural development is the result of the comprehensive and high-speed development of all departments within agriculture. Since liberation, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have led farmers throughout the country to pay attention to the development of diversified operations while vigorously developing grain production. The realization of the people's communes has created favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In order to develop agricultural production at a high speed and in an all-round way, the Party Central Committee proposed the policy of promoting agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries simultaneously under the premise of "taking grain as the key link," and promoting both grain crops and industrial raw material crops simultaneously. Over the past two years, China's agriculture has achieved a comprehensive and unprecedented leap forward, and all departments of agriculture have achieved substantial increases in production.

In the past ten years, in addition to the rapid growth of grain and cotton production, the output of various agricultural products such as oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicines, and miscellaneous grains has also increased significantly. At the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed rapidly. The national afforestation area reached 778 million mu, equivalent to more than half of China's original forest area before liberation. At the end of 1959, the number of pigs in stock nationwide reached 180 million, an increase of 2.1 times compared with 1949, with an average annual increase of 12%. In 1959, the number of large livestock reached 85.38 million, an increase of 42.3% compared with 1949; the number of sheep reached 112.53 million, an increase of 1.7 times compared with 1949. Other industries such as poultry farming, beekeeping, and rabbit breeding have also developed significantly. In terms of rural sideline occupations, the people's communes in various places in 1959 vigorously carried out the "small autumn harvest" movement of collecting wild plants, which achieved great results. The output value of agricultural and forestry sideline occupations increased more than twofold compared with 1949. With the rapid development of industries run by people's communes, some of the original rural sideline occupations have developed into industries run by communes and are gradually developing from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups." Marine and freshwater fisheries production has also made rapid progress in the past ten years. In 1959, the total output of aquatic products nationwide reached 5.02 million tons, an increase of 10.2 times compared with 1949.

Due to the comprehensive development of all departments of agriculture, the proportional relationship between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has begun to change. Before liberation, China's agricultural production was very backward, and the relationship between various departments within agriculture was also very uncoordinated. China has a vast area of land suitable for forestry, and its aquatic resources rank first in the world, but in 1949, forestry production and fishery production accounted for less than 1% of the total agricultural output value. Traditional sideline production in rural China has also not received due development. Over the past ten years, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all developed rapidly. Forestry production, sideline production, and fishery production have not only increased significantly in absolute terms, but also continue to increase in proportion to the overall agriculture. In 1959, the proportion of the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the total agricultural output value increased from 17% in 1949 to 23%. Although the proportion of the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is still not large, their development trends and speeds mark a new stage in China's agriculture moving towards integrated management and comprehensive development.

China's high-speed agricultural development is built on the foundation of the universal high-speed development of various regions. Before liberation, the level of agricultural development in various regions was very uneven, and the output of high-yield areas and low-yield areas varied greatly. Over the past ten years, this situation has gradually changed. Some regions that were called "low-yield" before liberation, such as Henan, which is often affected by disasters, Shandong, which has a large population and little land, and Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which have a small population and vast land, have seen an average development speed of around 10% in total agricultural output value and total grain output. The average annual growth rate in areas with a relatively good agricultural base is also nearly 10%. A new situation has emerged across the country in which low-yield areas are transformed into high-yield areas, and high-yield areas are becoming even more productive. In minority areas and remote mountainous areas, not only has animal husbandry production developed greatly, but also agricultural production has made rapid progress. The cotton field area in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 1959 expanded 3.5 times compared with 1949, and the output increased 14 times. In pastoral areas, people's living conditions have been greatly improved by changing the single animal husbandry production to diversified management. For example, in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, most areas did not engage in agriculture at all before liberation, and all grain was dependent on supplies from agricultural areas. The broad masses of herdsmen could only eat dozens of kilograms of grain per year. People in remote areas such as Yushu and Guoluo often could not eat grain all year round. In the ten years since liberation, while animal husbandry has developed rapidly, these areas have also achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in agricultural production. In 1959, the sown area in the pastoral areas of the province increased from 300,000 mu in 1949 to 1.55 million mu, an increase of four times. The total grain output increased from 29.15 million jin to 436.5 million jin, an increase of nearly 14 times. In 1959, ten of the 35 counties in the pastoral areas of the province had achieved self-sufficiency in grain, feed, and vegetables, and some counties and communes had achieved semi-self-sufficiency.

China's agricultural production has been able to achieve such high-speed development in the continuous struggle against natural disasters. During the First Five-Year Plan period, many areas suffered from natural disasters of varying degrees almost every year. According to incomplete statistics, the cultivated land area affected by droughts and floods within five years reached more than 800 million mu. Among them, the disasters in 1954 and 1956 were the most serious. In these two years alone, the flood area was more than 200 million mu. But even under these circumstances, agricultural production still increased in these two years. In 1959, China's agricultural production encountered even more severe natural disasters. The affected area nationwide reached 650 million mu, accounting for 30% of the country's sown area. The disasters were particularly severe in provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Guangdong. Some areas did not experience rain for three or four consecutive months, and some areas experienced major floods that had not been seen in a century. However, under the leadership of the Party, people in various regions fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes to conduct arduous struggles against droughts and floods, so that not only was there no reduction in production in 1959, but the total agricultural output value and total grain output actually increased compared with the great leap forward in 1958.

Since liberation, China's high-speed agricultural development, especially the new situation of continuous leaps forward that has emerged since 1958, is the result of giving full play to the great superiority of the socialist system and fully promoting the creativity and enthusiasm of more than 500 million peasants under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. It is the result of implementing the Party's general line of socialist revolution, and is the result of implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction and realizing the people's communes. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific practice, and creatively solved a series of problems in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, so that China's agricultural front, like other fronts, has continuously moved forward from one victory to another.

The rapid development of agricultural productive forces in our country is inseparable from the timely and continuous transformation of production relations. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have grasped the dialectical relationship between productive relations and productive forces, and adapted to the needs of agricultural production development, leading peasants throughout the country to continuously and timely change production relations, opening up broad roads for the development of productive forces. After liberation, the Party led the broad masses of peasants to implement land reform, liberating peasants from the shackles of the feudal land ownership system. The peasants' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and agricultural production achieved rapid development. In the first year after the basic completion of land reform, namely 1952, the total agricultural output value increased by 15.3% compared with 1951; the total grain output reached 308.8 billion jin, an increase of 14.3%; and the total cotton output reached 26.07 million dan, an increase of 26.5%.

After land reform, in order to further develop agricultural productive forces, the Party immediately led the peasants to gradually embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. By the end of 1953, 45,637,000 households across the country had participated in temporary mutual aid teams and permanent mutual aid teams. Although mutual aid teams still maintained the private ownership of the means of production, they had initially organized individual peasants to implement collective labor. This was conducive to the improvement of agricultural production. Generally speaking, mutual aid teams had about 10% higher grain yield per mu than individual farmers. Later, the Party led the peasants to further organize primary agricultural production cooperatives characterized by land shares and unified management, initially resolving the contradiction between collective labor and private ownership encountered by mutual aid teams, and further improving agricultural production. In 1954, according to statistics from more than 114,000 primary agricultural cooperatives, 80% of them increased production, generally increasing by 15% to 20% compared with 1953, which was higher than general mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Although the Yangtze River and Huai River regions suffered a major flood in 1954 that had not been seen in a century, the total grain output nationwide still reached 320.9 billion jin, an increase of more than 7 billion jin compared with 1953. In July 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation in China over the years and made a report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization." After that, a high tide of agricultural cooperativization formed across the country, and by the end of 1955, primary cooperativization had basically been realized in rural areas across the country. In 1956, advanced cooperativization was basically realized in rural areas across the country. After the realization of advanced cooperativization, agricultural production was further improved. As everyone knows, although China encountered natural disasters in 1956 that had not been seen in many years, thanks to the victorious completion of agricultural cooperativization, the broad masses of peasants who had been organized gave full play to the superiority of advanced agricultural production cooperatives under the leadership of the Party, and finally ensured a relatively large increase in agricultural production. The total agricultural output value nationwide increased by 4.9% compared with the bumper harvest of 1955, and the total grain output increased by 4.4%.

In 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line of socialist construction, a great leap forward in production and the establishment of people's communes were realized in rural areas across the country. The people's communes have greater superiority than advanced agricultural production cooperatives and are more conducive to the high-speed development of agricultural production. The growth rate of total agricultural output value, total grain output, and total cotton output in 1958 and 1959 was four to six times faster than the growth rate in the two years of 1956 and 1957 after agricultural cooperativization.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached importance to the leadership of agricultural production. He once pointed out that "China is a large agricultural country, and the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the country's population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture, so that industry has raw materials and markets, and it is possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People.") In order to rapidly develop agriculture, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a series of guidelines, policies, and production increase measures. For example, in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was proposed that the main way for China to develop agriculture was to increase the yield per unit area, while expanding the area of cultivated land. Later, many effective measures were proposed in terms of water conservancy construction, the development of draft animals, the improvement of cultivation systems, the promotion of improved varieties, and the reform of agricultural tools. In particular, in January 1956, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, proposed the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967. This program is a great program for the high-speed development of China's agriculture and the construction of a new socialist countryside. It stipulates the requirements for greatly increasing the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in a short period of time. It stipulates that within twelve years, the average annual grain yield per mu should reach 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin in three different regions, respectively. At the same time, it also stipulated the targets for increasing the production of other major agricultural products, and various effective measures to achieve the targets, and formulated plans for developing rural culture, education, health, and other aspects on the basis of developing production. The publication of this draft program generated a huge appeal and mobilizing force, and a movement to strive to realize the various targets stipulated in the agricultural development program ahead of schedule was immediately launched in rural areas, greatly promoting the development of agricultural production.

On the basis of achieving major victories in socialist education in rural areas, the Party Central Committee promulgated the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program in October 1957. A new upsurge of agricultural production and construction was launched in rural areas. In the winter of that year, a mass movement to build water conservancy on a large scale, unprecedented in Chinese history, appeared throughout the country. From October 1957 to September 1958, the country expanded the irrigated area by 480 million mu, the area of low-lying areas treated for flood control by 210 million mu, and the area where soil and water conservation measures were initially implemented by 320,000 square kilometers. Hydropower stations with a power generation capacity of 130,000 kilowatts were newly built in rural areas.

By 1959, there were 504 counties that had achieved an average annual grain yield per mu of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively, accounting for 28% of the country's 1,786 counties; there were 286,777,000 mu of grain cultivated land, accounting for 24% of the country's existing 1.2 billion mu of grain cultivated land. There were a total of 204 counties with a per mu yield of ginned cotton of 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin or more, accounting for 20% of the country's 1,027 cotton-growing counties; there were a total of 36,484,400 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 42% of the cotton field area of more than 85 million mu. The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, which was held in April of this year, officially passed the Agricultural Development Program and called for its realization two or three years ahead of schedule. Currently, the people of the whole country are working hard to achieve this great goal as soon as possible.

The increasingly widespread application of modern science and technology by the broad masses of peasants in agricultural production, and the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production, is also one of the important reasons for the high-speed development of agricultural production in our country. As early as during the war years, when the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong led the production in the liberated areas, they repeatedly emphasized the importance of building water conservancy, pointing out that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture" ("Our Economic Policy." "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, People's Publishing House, 1952 edition, page 127.), and also emphasized the promotion of improved varieties, intensive cultivation, pest and disease prevention, and so on. After the nationwide liberation, with the support of the people's government, science and technology were increasingly applied in agricultural production. Especially in the great leap forward in 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong applied advanced agricultural scientific principles, summarized the production experience of Chinese farmers over thousands of years, especially the experience of agricultural technology transformation since liberation, and proposed the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture: soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and tools. For more than two years, the people's communes in various places have generally implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and have achieved great results. In terms of soil improvement, out of more than 700 million mu of low-lying, flood-prone land and various low-yield fields across the country, 450 million mu have been initially improved, accounting for 60%. Of the 1.5 million square kilometers of land area with relatively serious soil erosion, 600,000 square kilometers have been initially subjected to soil and water conservation measures, accounting for 40%. In terms of water conservancy construction, the irrigated area increased by 550 million mu in 1958 and 1959, more than twice the accumulated area in the thousands of years before liberation. The existing irrigated area has reached 1.007 billion mu. Among them, 610 million mu have reached the 30-day, 50-day, and 70-day drought resistance standards stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. In terms of fertilizers, due to the great development of the pig-raising industry in recent years, the area of green manure has expanded, and the communes have established many indigenous fertilizer plants. The state has also invested in the construction of some modern fertilizer plants. Therefore, both organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers have increased greatly. In terms of improved variety promotion, the area sown with improved varieties in 1959 reached 1.8 billion mu, accounting for 80% of the total sown area. Improved varieties of major crops such as cotton, wheat, rice, and potatoes have been basically popularized. Rational close planting has been widely promoted. Significant results have also been achieved in the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. For example, the loss rate of rice stem borers has decreased from 30% before liberation to about 2%. The incidence of wheat smut has decreased from 10% to 15% to below 1%. The agricultural tool reform movement has also achieved great results. By the end of 1959, more than 520 million pieces of various improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools had been promoted, which played a great role in improving labor productivity. Among them, the invention of rice transplanters has been particularly significant in changing the appearance of production in vast rice-growing areas of China. In terms of field management and intensive cultivation, there have also been new developments, and people's communes in various places are vigorously carrying out high-yield plots and garden-style management.

Implementing political command and implementing the mass line leadership method is the decisive factor in achieving high-speed agricultural development.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have proposed a complete set of leadership methods for implementing the mass line in agricultural production, mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to invest in production to the greatest extent, which is the decisive factor in China's high-speed agricultural development.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached importance to putting politics in command in leading agricultural production, emphasizing that the production enthusiasm of the broad masses should be built on a high degree of political consciousness. In particular, in 1957, the method of the all-people rectification campaign and the free airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters was used to conduct general line and socialist and communist education among the peasants, which greatly improved the consciousness of the masses and unprecedentedly promoted the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. The broad masses of peasants were full of vitality and energy. Adapting to the seasonality of agricultural production, they vigorously carried out mass movements and strengthened the scientific management of crops. They also vigorously carried out farmland capital construction in appropriate seasons, implemented large-scale cooperation, and concentrated on key projects. For example, in the water conservancy construction movement in the winter of 1959, more than 70 million people participated across the country. In the tool reform, they also launched a vigorous mass movement, adhering to the spirit of reforming whatever needs to be reformed and reforming whatever can be reformed, pooling the wisdom and efforts of the masses, so that the tool reform achieved significant results.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the method of universally promoting the cultivation of experimental fields among the vast number of rural cadres, implementing the "three-way combination" of cadres, masses, and technicians. In the process of cultivating experimental fields, the work of political and ideological work was strengthened due to the participation of leading cadres; due to the participation of technicians and experienced peasants, modern science and technology were combined with the practical experience of the peasants. Rich experience in increasing production was obtained through the cultivation of experimental fields. The promotion of this experience is an extremely important factor in promoting the universal high-speed development of agriculture in various regions of China. In addition, in leading agricultural production, various places also adopted the working methods of the mass line such as "grasping both ends and bringing the middle along," holding on-site meetings, and conducting visits and comparisons, promptly summarizing and promoting advanced experience, so that the production of advanced areas can be continuously improved, and other areas can also achieve rapid development in production through on-the-spot observation and learning.

Strong state support and multi-faceted assistance from various sectors of the national economy have created favorable conditions for high-speed agricultural development.

China's high-speed agricultural development is, of course, inseparable from the strong support of the state and the strong assistance from other sectors of the national economy, especially the industrial sector.

First of all, the state has vigorously promoted agricultural development through a series of policies and measures. The state's investment in agricultural capital construction is increasing year by year. From 1950 to 1958, the state issued nearly 12.6 billion yuan in agricultural loans. After the realization of the people's communes in 1958, the state invested 1 billion yuan in the people's communes to support the development of the commune economy. In 1959, the state issued another 3.5 billion yuan in agricultural loans. In terms of state taxation, a light tax policy was adopted for agriculture. Despite the large increase in agricultural production, agricultural taxes have basically not increased in recent years. The proportion of agricultural taxes in the state's financial revenue is decreasing year by year: 29.3% in 1950, 9.6% in 1957, and 7.8% in 1958. Looking at the proportion of agricultural taxes (including regular taxes and surcharges) in the actual agricultural output of the year, it was 13.2% in 1952, 11.5% in 1957, only 9.6% in 1958, and continued to decline in 1959.

Various sectors of the national economy have also provided multi-faceted assistance to agriculture. Recently, under the instructions of the Party Central Committee, various departments have taken accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture as the center, and in accordance with the characteristics of their own departments, and around the needs of the comprehensive and great development of agriculture, have vigorously supported agriculture from their respective positions in terms of materials, technology, and experience in a planned manner. The agricultural machinery industry has developed rapidly, and its production capacity has also greatly increased. In 1959, the state's supply of agricultural means of production increased even more: the number of tractors increased by 29.2% compared with 1958, the number of machine-drawn plows increased by 57%, the number of machine-drawn harrows increased by 114%, and the horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery increased by 112.2%; the output of chemical fertilizers and pesticides also increased by more than 60% compared with 1958. According to the 1960 plan for industry to support agriculture, the production of major agricultural means of production will increase several times on the basis of 1959. At the same time, many industrial enterprises have also sent a large number of workers and technicians to support county and commune industries. At present, many factories across the country have adopted the method of linking up with people's communes to support agriculture.

The transportation and commerce departments have also provided strong support to agriculture. Scientific and educational work has also been oriented to agricultural production, doing scientific research work according to the needs of agricultural production, and helping rural areas to solve urgently needed scientific and technological problems in production in a timely manner, and helping rural areas to develop mass agricultural scientific and technological research work. At present, science and technology promotion stations, livestock breeding stations, animal husbandry and veterinary stations, and meteorological stations have been universally established in rural areas across the country. The culture, health, and sports departments have also helped rural areas to carry out mass cultural and recreational activities, run nurseries and commune hospitals, etc., and carry out mass sports activities.

Ten years is only a brief moment in human history. In this short period of time, China's agricultural production has achieved tremendous development, making the entire agricultural landscape焕然一新 (completely transformed). Because China has been ruled by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for a long time, the original agricultural base was very weak. Although China's agriculture has developed rapidly, the per capita output of agricultural products is still very low, agricultural modernization equipment is still very scarce, labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products are not high, and it is still necessary to make great efforts to completely change the backwardness of China's agriculture. However, we have the correct leadership of the wise Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party's general line of socialist construction, the increasingly developing people's commune system, more than 500 million highly conscious and energetic peasants, the technical innovation and technical revolution movements widely carried out in rural areas, the strong support of all walks of life for agriculture, the rich experience in developing agricultural production, and so on. We will surely be able to make China's agriculture leap forward at a high speed, proportionately, and sustainably, and make China's agriculture a highly modernized agriculture in a not-too-long period of time.

    我国农业的高速度发展
    司马农
    建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。我们的革命的目的，就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。毛泽东同志指出，我国国民经济的发展，要以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合。高速度地发展农业，是高速度、按比例地发展我国国民经济的中心环节。
    我国农业的发展速度一直很高，这充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性
    建国十年来，我国农业的发展速度，一直是很高的。在国民经济恢复时期，由于党对农业的正确政策，由于完成了对封建土地制度的改革，解放了农村生产力，农业生产得到了迅速的恢复和发展。到1952年，全国农业总产值达到四百八十三亿九千万元（按1952年不变价格计算），比1949年增长了48．5％。主要农产品的产量，都已经恢复并且超过了抗日战争前的生产水平。粮食总产量达到三千零八十八亿斤，棉花总产量达到二千六百零七万担。
    在第一个五年计划期间，随着我国大规模的有计划的经济建设的开展和农业合作化的胜利完成，农业生产有了进一步的发展。1957年农业总产值达到六百零三亿五千万元（按1952年不变价格计算），比1952年增长24．7％，粮食总产量达到三千七百亿斤，棉花总产量达到三千二百八十万担。
    在第二个五年计划的头两年，由于政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命取得了伟大的胜利，由于全国农村实现了人民公社化，农业生产获得了我国历史上从来没有过的连续大跃进。到1959年，农业总产值和粮食、棉花的总产量，都已胜利地提前三年超额完成了第二个五年计划所规定的1962年的指标。农业总产值达到七百八十三亿元（按1957年不变价格计算），比1957年增长45．8％，每年平均递增20．7％。粮食每年平均递增20．8％；棉花每年平均递增21．2％。1958年和1959年农业的发展速度，表明了我国农业完全能够以比国民经济恢复时期和第一个五年计划时期更高的速度跃进，同时表明，我国农业的发展进入了一个新的历史时期。
    建国十年来，我国农业总产值共增长了一点七倍，每年平均递增10．4％。粮食总产量增长一点五倍，每年平均递增9．6％；棉花总产量增长了四点四倍，每年平均递增18．4％。这样高的发展速度，充分证明了我国社会主义制度的巨大生命力和无可辩驳的优越性。
    这样高的发展速度，在旧中国，是根本不可想像的。抗日战争前几年的农业生产，在旧中国说来是最好的，但发展速度也很低。例如，粮食从1931年到1936年，每年平均只增长2．5％；棉花从1919年到1936年，每年平均只增长2．8％。
    我国农业这样高的发展速度，也是资本主义国家望尘莫及的。从1950年到1958年，我国农业每年平均增长9．8％，而资本主义国家一般的增长速度只有2％左右，不到我国农业发展速度的四分之一。就拿美国这个在资本主义世界中农业最发达的国家来说，从1950年到1958年，农业每年平均增长不过2．2％，1953年到1957年，每年平均增长则只有1．1％。就是在1860年到1910年美国农业发展最快的时期，每年平均增长也只有2．5％左右。这个速度远远低于我国第一个五年计划期间的发展速度，当然更不能和我国大跃进的1958年和1959年相比较。以我国和各主要资本主义国家近几年粮食和棉花发展速度来比较：从1950年到1958年，我国粮食总产量每年平均递增速度为9．8％，为西德的将近五倍，为日本的四倍多，为美国的将近四倍，为法国的三倍多；英国1958年粮食产量比1949年不但没有增加，反而减少6．5％。同一期间，我国棉花产量每年平均递增速度为18．8％，比资本主义国家的增长速度一般要快一、两倍到好几倍；美国1958年棉花产量比1949年不但没有增长，反而下降了28．1％。
    农业战线上的持续大跃进，是贯彻执行党的总路线和实现人民公社化的结果
    我国农业的高速度发展，是农业内部各部门全面高速度发展的结果。解放以来，党中央和毛泽东同志领导全国农民，在大力发展粮食生产的同时，也注意了发展多种经营。人民公社化的实现，为全面地发展农、林、牧、副、渔创造了良好的条件。为了高速度地、全面地发展农业生产，党中央提出了在“以粮为纲”的前提下，农、林、牧、副、渔各业同时并举，粮食作物和工业原料作物同时并举的方针。两年来，我国农业获得了全面的空前的大跃进，农业的各个部门都获得了大幅度的增产。
    十年来，除粮、棉生产有了迅速增长以外，油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等各种农产品的产量，也都有很大的增长。与此同时，林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业也得到了迅速发展。全国造林面积共达七亿七千八百万亩，相当于解放前我国原有森林面积的一半以上。1959年底，全国猪的存栏头数达到一亿八千万头，比1949年增长二点一倍，每年平均递增12％。1959年大家畜达到八千五百三十八万头，比1949年增长42．3％；羊达到一亿一千二百五十三万只，比1949年增长一点七倍。其他如养禽业、养蜂业、养兔业等，都有很大的发展。在农村副业方面，1959年各地人民公社大搞采集野生植物的“小秋收”运动，取得了巨大成绩，农林副业产值比1949年增长二倍多。随着人民公社社办工业的迅速发展，部分原来的农村副业已经发展成为社办工业，并且正在由“小土群”逐步向“小洋群”发展。海洋和淡水的渔业生产，在这十年中也有了突飞猛进的发展。1959年全国水产品总量达到五百零二万吨，比1949年增长十点二倍。
    由于农业各部门全面的发展，农、林、牧、副、渔五业间的比例关系开始发生了变化。解放前，我国农业生产十分落后，农业内部各部门之间的关系也很不协调。我国宜林地面积很广，水产资源占世界第一位，但在1949年，在整个农业总产值中，林业生产、渔业生产都不到1％。我国农村素有传统的副业生产，也没有得到应有的发展。十年来，农、林、牧、副、渔各业都有了迅速的发展，林业生产、副业生产和渔业生产，不仅在绝对量上有很大的增长，而且在整个农业中的比重也不断上升。1959年的农业总产值中，林、牧、副、渔各业产值的比重已由1949年的17％上升为23％。目前，林、牧、副、渔各业的产值所占的比重虽然都还不大，但它们的发展趋势和发展速度，却标志着我国农业已经走向综合经营和全面大发展的新阶段。
    我国农业的高速度发展，是建筑在各地区普遍高速度发展的基础之上的。解放前，各地区农业发展的水平是很不平衡的，高产区和低产区的产量，高低很悬殊。十年来，这种状况逐渐有所改变。一些解放前被称为“低产”的地区，如常年多灾的河南，人多地少的山东，人稀地广的新疆、内蒙古等省、区，农业总产值和粮食总产量平均发展速度都在10％左右。原来农业基础较好的地区，每年平均递增速度也将近10％。全国出现了低产区变高产、高产区更高产的新局面。在少数民族地区和边远山区，不仅畜牧业生产有了很大的发展，而且农业生产也有了突飞猛进的发展。新疆维吾尔自治区1959年棉田面积比1949年扩大了三点五倍，产量增加了十四倍。在牧业区，由于已经把单一的畜牧业生产改变为多种经营，从而大大地改善了人民的生活状况。例如青海省牧业区，解放前绝大部分地区根本不经营农业，粮食全部依赖农业区供应，广大牧民群众每人一年只能吃到几十斤粮食；玉树、果洛等边远地区的群众，甚至常年吃不到粮食。解放十年来，在畜牧业迅速发展的同时，这些地区的农业生产也获得了史无前例的光辉成就：1959年全省牧业区的播种面积，由1949年的三十万亩发展到一百五十五万亩，增加了四倍；粮食总产量由二千九百一十五万斤增加到四亿三千六百五十万斤，增加将近十四倍；1959年全省牧业区三十五个县中，已有十个县实现了粮食、饲料、蔬菜自给，还有一部分县和公社实现了半自给。
    我国农业生产能够获得如此高速度的发展，是在同自然灾害不断作斗争中取得的。在第一个五年计划期间，几乎每年都有不少地区遭受不同程度的自然灾害，据不完全的统计，五年内遭受水旱灾害的耕地面积约达到八亿余亩。其中1954年和1956年灾害最为严重，这两年仅水灾面积就在二亿亩以上。但即使在这种情况下，这两年的农业生产还是增长的。1959年，我国农业生产遇到更严重的自然灾害，全国受灾面积达六亿五千万亩，占全国播种面积的30％，河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、湖北、江苏、浙江、安徽、四川、广东等省受灾尤为严重，有的地区一连三、四个月没有下雨，有的地区发生了百年未遇的大水灾。但在党的领导下，各地人民充分利用了人民公社的优越性，向水旱灾害进行了艰巨的斗争，因而使1959年不但没有减产，农业总产值和粮食总产量反而比大跃进的1958年增产了。
    解放后，我国农业的高速度发展，特别是1958年以来出现的连续大跃进的新局面，是在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，充分发挥了社会主义制度的巨大优越性，充分发扬了五亿多农民的创造性、积极性的结果，是贯彻执行党的社会主义革命总路线的结果，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和实现人民公社化的结果。党中央和毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国的具体实践相结合，创造性地解决了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一系列的问题，使我国农业战线和其他战线一样，不断地由一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    我国农业生产力的迅速发展，是和生产关系的适时的不断变革分不开的。党中央和毛泽东同志掌握了生产关系和生产力的辩证关系，适应农业生产发展的需要，领导全国农民不断地适时地改变生产关系，为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。解放以后，党领导广大农民，实行了土地改革，使农民从封建土地所有制束缚下解放出来。农民的生产积极性空前提高，农业生产获得了迅速的发展。土地改革基本完成的第一年，即1952年，农业总产值就比1951年增长了15．3％；粮食总产量达到三千零八十八亿斤，增长了14．3％；棉花总产量达到二千六百零七万担，增长了26．5％。
    土地改革以后，为了进一步发展农业生产力，党紧接着又领导农民逐步走上互助合作的道路。到1953年底，全国已有四千五百六十三万七千户参加了临时互助组和常年互助组。互助组虽然还是生产资料私有制，但已把个体农民初步组织起来，实行集体劳动。这就有利于农业生产的提高。一般地说，互助组比单干农民，粮食亩产量要高10％左右。以后，党又领导农民进一步组织以土地入股、统一经营为特征的初级农业生产合作社，初步解决了互助组所遇到的集体劳动和私有制的矛盾，使农业生产得到再进一步的提高。1954年，据十一万四千多个初级农业社的统计，有80％是增产的，一般都比1953年增产15％至20％，高于一般互助组和单干农民。1954年长江、淮河地区虽然遭受了百年未有的大水灾，但全国粮食总产量仍然达到三千二百零九亿斤，比1953年增加七十多亿斤。1955年7月，毛泽东同志总结了我国多年来农业互助合作的经验，作了“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，之后，全国形成了农业合作化的高潮，到1955年底全国农村就基本上实现了初级合作化。1956年全国农村又基本上实现了高级合作化。实现高级合作化以后，农业生产又进一步得到提高。大家知道，1956年我国虽然遇到了多年没有的自然灾害，但是，由于农业合作化的胜利完成，组织起来了的广大农民在党的领导下，发挥了高级农业生产合作社的优越性，终于保证了农业生产的比较大的增长，这一年全国农业总产值比大丰收的1955年增长4．9％，粮食总产量增长了4．4％。
    1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国农村实现了生产大跃进和人民公社化。人民公社比高级农业生产合作社有更大的优越性，更有利于农业生产的高速度发展。1958年和1959年全国农业总产值、粮食和棉花总产量的增长速度，比农业合作化后的1956年和1957年两年的增长速度，都分别加快了四倍到六倍。
    党中央和毛泽东同志一贯重视对农业生产的领导。他曾指出，“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的80％以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。”）为了迅速发展农业，党中央和毛泽东同志制订了一系列的方针、政策和增产措施。例如，在建国初期，提出了我国发展农业的主要途径是提高单位面积产量，同时要扩大耕地面积。以后，在兴修水利、发展耕畜、改良栽培制度、推广优良品种、改革农具等方面，又提出了许多有效的措施。特别是1956年1月中共中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的倡议，提出了关于1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）。这个纲要是高速度发展我国农业建设我国社会主义新农村的伟大纲领，它规定了在不长的时间内，大大提高我国农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产的要求；规定十二年内粮食每亩平均年产量，在三种不同的地区，分别达到四百斤、五百斤和八百斤。同时，还规定了其他主要农产品增产的指标，和达到指标的各种有效措施，并制订了在发展生产的基础上，发展农村文化、教育、卫生等各方面的规划。这个纲要草案一公布，就产生了巨大的号召作用和动员力量，广大农村立即掀起了一个争取提前实现农业发展纲要所规定的各项指标的运动，大大推动了农业生产的发展。
    在农村社会主义教育取得重大胜利的基础上，党中央于1957年10月，又公布了农业发展纲要修正草案。农村又掀起了农业生产和建设的新高潮。这年冬天在全国范围内出现了我国历史上从未有过的大兴水利的群众运动。从1957年10月到1958年9月，全国共扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，洼改治涝面积二亿一千万亩，初步实施水土保持措施的面积三十二万平方公里，在农村新建了发电能力达十三万瓩的水电站。
    到1959年，粮食每亩平均年产量分别达到四百斤、五百斤和八百斤的，已经有五百零四个县，占全国一千七百八十六个县的28％；已经有二亿八千六百七十七万亩粮食耕地，占全国现有十二亿亩粮食耕地的24％。亩产皮棉分别达到六十斤、八十斤和一百斤以上的，共有二百零四个县，占全国一千零二十七个植棉县的20％；共有三千六百四十八万四千亩棉田，占棉田面积八千五百多万亩的42％。今年4月召开的第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议正式通过了农业发展纲要，并号召提前两年或者三年实现。目前，全国人民正在为尽快实现这个伟大目标而努力。
    广大农民在农业生产中日益广泛地应用现代科学技术，贯彻执行农业增产的“八字宪法”，也是我国农业生产高速度发展的重要原因之一。早在战争时期，党和毛泽东同志在领导解放区的生产的时候，就反复强调兴修水利的重要，指出“水利是农业的命脉”，（“我们的经济政策”。“毛泽东选集”，第一卷，人民出版社1952年版，第一百二十七页。）并且强调推广优良品种、精耕细作、防治病虫害，等等。全国解放以后，在人民政府的支持下，农业生产中越来越多地应用了科学技术。特别是在1958年大跃进中，毛泽东同志应用先进的农业科学原理，总结了我国农民群众几千年来的生产经验，尤其是解放以来的农业技术改造的经验，提出了土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工的农业“八字宪法”。两年多来，各地人民公社普遍执行了农业“八字宪法”，取得了很大成绩。在改良土壤方面，在全国七亿多亩低洼易涝地和各种低产田中，已初步改良了四亿五千万亩，占60％。在一百五十万平方公里水土流失比较严重的土地面积上，初步进行了水土保持措施的有六十万平方公里，占40％。在水利建设方面，1958年和1959年两年增加了灌溉面积五亿五千万亩，为解放前几千年累计面积的二倍多，现有灌溉面积已达十亿零七千万亩。其中有六亿一千万亩，抗旱能力已经分别达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的三十天、五十天和七十天的标准。在肥料方面，由于几年来养猪业大大发展，绿肥面积扩大，公社大办土化肥厂，国家也投资兴建了一些现代化的化肥厂，因此，有机肥料和无机肥料都有很大增加。在良种推广方面，1959年用良种播种的面积达到十八亿亩，占总播种面积的80％。棉、麦、稻、薯等主要农作物的良种已经基本普及。合理密植已经广泛推行。防治病虫害的工作也有了显著的成效。例如，水稻发生稻螟的损失率已由解放前的30％下降到2％左右；麦类黑穗病的发病率已由10％至15％下降到1％以下。农业工具改革运动，也取得了很大成绩，到1959年底共推广了各种改良农具和半机械化农具五亿二千多万件，对提高劳动生产率起了很大的作用；其中水稻插秧机的发明，对我国广大水稻地区生产面貌的改变，尤其有着重大的意义。在田间管理和精耕细作方面，也有新的发展，各地人民公社都在大搞丰产方，大搞园田化。
    实行政治挂帅和贯彻群众路线的领导方法，是实现农业高速度发展的决定因素
    党中央和毛泽东同志提出了一整套在农业生产中贯彻群众路线的领导方法，在最大范围内动员了广大农民投入生产，是我国农业高速度发展的决定性因素。
    党中央和毛泽东同志在领导农业生产中一贯重视政治挂帅，强调把广大群众的生产积极性建筑在高度政治觉悟的基础上。特别是1957年采用全民整风和大鸣大放大辩论的方法，对农民进行总路线和社会主义、共产主义教育，大大提高了群众的觉悟，空前发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，广大农民生气勃勃，干劲十足。他们适应着农业生产的季节性，大搞群众运动，加强了农作物的科学管理。他们还在适当的季节，大搞农田基本建设，实行大协作，突击重点工程。如1959年冬季的兴修水利运动，全国就有七千多万人参加。他们在工具改革中，也掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，本着需要改什么就改什么、能改什么就改什么的精神，群策群力，集思广益，使工具改革获得了重大成绩。
    党中央和毛泽东同志提出了在广大农村干部中普遍推广种试验田的方法，实行干部、群众和技术人员的三结合。在种试验田的过程中，由于领导干部的参加，政治思想工作加强了；由于技术人员和有经验的农民参加，现代科学技术和农民的实践经验结合起来了。通过种试验田，取得了丰富的增产经验。这些经验的推广，是促使我国各地区农业普遍高速度发展的极其重要的因素。此外，各地在领导农业生产中，还采用了“抓两头、带中间”、召开现场会议、进行参观评比等群众路线的工作方法，及时地总结和推广先进经验，使先进地区的生产不断得到提高，其他地区经过实地的观摩、学习，也能够使生产获得迅速发展。
    国家大力扶持，国民经济各部门多方支援，为农业的高速度发展创造了有利的条件
    我国农业的高速度发展，当然也是与国家的大力扶助，以及国民经济其他部门特别是工业部门的大力支援分不开的。
    首先，国家通过一系列的政策措施，有力地促进农业的发展。国家对农业的基本建设投资是逐年增长的。从1950年到1958年，国家共发放农业贷款将近一百二十六亿元。1958年实现人民公社化后，国家向人民公社投资十亿元，扶助公社经济的发展。1959年国家又发放了农业贷款三十五亿元。在国家税收方面，对于农业采取了轻税政策。尽管农业生产的增长幅度很大，但是，几年来农业税基本没有增加。农业税在国家财政收入中所占的比重是逐年下降的：1950年为29．3％，1957年下降为9．6％，1958年又下降为7．8％。再从农业税（包括正税和附加）占当年农业实际产量的比例来看，1952年为13．2％，1957年为11．5％，1958年只有9．6％，1959年又继续有所下降。
    国民经济各部门对农业也作了多方面的援助。最近，在党中央的指示下，各部门都以加速农业技术改造为中心，根据本部门的特点，围绕农业全面大发展的需要，从各自不同的岗位有计划地从物质上、技术上和经验方面对农业进行了大力支援。农业机械工业迅速地发展起来了，生产能力也大大地提高了。1959年国家供应农业的生产资料有了更大的增长：拖拉机台数比1958年增长了29．2％，机引犁增长了57％，机引耙增长了114％，排灌机械的马力增长了112．2％；化学肥料和农药的产量，也都比1958年增长60％以上。根据1960年工业支援农业的计划，主要农业生产资料的生产将在1959年的基础上成倍地增长。同时，很多工业企业还派遣了大批工人和技术人员支援县、社工业。目前，全国各地很多工厂，又采用了同人民公社挂钩的方法支援农业。
    交通运输部门和商业部门也都对农业进行了大力的支援。科学教育工作也做到了面向农业生产，根据农业生产的需要做科学研究工作，及时帮助农村解决生产上急需解决的科学技术问题，帮助农村发展群众性的农业科学技术研究工作。现在全国农村普遍建立了科学技术推广站、牲畜配种站、畜牧兽医工作站、气象站。文化、卫生、体育部门也都帮助农村开展群众性的文化娱乐活动，办好托儿所、公社医院等等事业，开展群众性的体育活动。
    十年的时间，在人类历史上，只是短暂的一瞬间，就在这短短的时间里，我国农业生产获得了巨大的发展，使整个农业的面貌焕然一新。由于我国长期受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，原有的农业基础十分薄弱，虽然我国农业得到了迅速的发展，现在按人口平均的农产品的产量还很低，农业上的现代化设备还很少，劳动生产率和农产品的商品率还不高，还需要作很大的努力，才能彻底改变我国农业的落后面貌。但是我们有英明的党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导，有党的社会主义建设总路线，有日益发展着的人民公社制度，有五亿多觉悟高、干劲大的农民，有广大农村普遍开展着的技术革新和技术革命运动，有各行各业对农业的大力支援，有发展农业生产的丰富经验，等等，我们一定能够使我国农业高速度地、按比例地持续跃进，在不要很久的时间内，使我国农业成为具有高度现代化的农业。
