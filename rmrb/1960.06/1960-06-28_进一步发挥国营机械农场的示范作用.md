    Further Enhance the Demonstrative Role of State-Owned Mechanized Farms
    Zhang Linchi, First Secretary of the CPC Hejiang District Committee, Heilongjiang Province, and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation

    In 1959, each agricultural worker at the Ninth Branch Farm of the State-Owned Luobei Farm produced more than 94,000 jin of grain, with each agricultural worker in the First Production Team producing 140,000 jin of grain. The grain commodity rate reached over 80% to 90%. This is not only a major event in agriculture in our Hejiang area but also a major event in agriculture in our Heilongjiang Province. They have not only set a good example for large-scale mechanized state-owned farms but also pointed out the prospects for achieving agricultural mechanization for the people's communes.

    State-owned farms are large-scale agricultural enterprises that can fully utilize and effectively leverage the role of mechanization to achieve agricultural technological transformation. Consequently, the yields of major crops are higher than those of local farmers. In the early stages of agricultural cooperation, state-owned farms had a pilot nature, but they already demonstrated their superiority and played a certain demonstrative role in guiding farmers from individual operations to large-scale collective operations. At that time, state-owned farms also used machines to cultivate and reclaim land for nearby agricultural production cooperatives, helped train technical cadres, and directly supplied improved seeds and superior breeding livestock. They also played a certain demonstrative role in reforming farming systems, deep plowing, close planting, and implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

    The rural areas have already realized the people's commune system, and the people's communes have embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development. Do state-owned farms still have a demonstrative role? Some people once had the following idea: in the past, farms should play a demonstrative, guiding, and promoting role in the transition from the individual small-peasant economy to the collective economy; now that the people's communes have been established, the people's communes themselves are large-scale agricultural enterprises, and they are comprehensive operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and they are organizations that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, and integrate government and commune management, so farms no longer need to play any demonstrative role. This is because they do not understand that the current rural people's communes are still collectively owned, that the rural people's communes still have a large amount of manual labor, and that they will carry out a comprehensive technical transformation in the future to achieve mechanization and modernization.

    State-owned farms are enterprises owned by the whole people under the socialist system. In the national people's commune movement, state-owned farms, like the people's communes, implemented the integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military within the farms, organized life while organizing production, and implemented the integration of the state's grassroots political power organs in rural areas and farm management organizations. Therefore, state-owned farms have actually become people's communes owned by the whole people. Since the people's communes are currently still collectively owned, state-owned farms should demonstrate the greater superiority of socialist mechanized production owned by the whole people and should continue to play a demonstrative role in mechanized production, labor productivity, yield per unit area, product cost, and collective welfare, so as to help the development of the people's communes, guide the people's communes to gradually transition to ownership by the whole people, and transition to communism in the future.

    How can state-owned farms play a demonstrative role for the people's communes? The most fundamental issue is to give full play to the superiority of state-owned farms owned by the whole people, greatly improve labor productivity, and produce a large number of agricultural and livestock products for the country, that is, greatly increase the rate of agricultural and livestock products sold to the state. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Only when people engaged in agricultural production produce more grain and industrial raw materials can more people engage in other various production and construction activities and change the situation in which 500 million people in our country are engaged in providing food. Marx once said:
  "Agricultural labor productivity that exceeds the needs of individual laborers is the foundation of all societies" and also the foundation of socialism. State-owned farms are agricultural enterprises owned by the whole people and have great superiority. Last year, Luobei Farm and Youyi Farm gave full play to the superiority of mechanized production owned by the whole people, greatly improved labor productivity, produced a large number of agricultural and livestock products for the country, and played a demonstrative role for the people's communes.

    In order to greatly increase labor productivity and produce a large number of agricultural and livestock products for the country, it is necessary to realize the agricultural technological transformation centered on agricultural mechanization on the basis of the people's commune system. Chairman Mao once said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Only when China has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in the social and economic system, and technically, in all departments and places where machines can be used, all operations are performed by machines, can the social and economic outlook be completely changed." For thousands of years, the farmers of our country have accumulated rich farming experience in improving agricultural production, and the essence of this experience is the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture summarized by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Achieving agricultural mechanization can implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture at a higher level. Youyi Farm and Luobei Farm, due to the realization of mechanization and combined with the conditions of local farming methods, have reformed agricultural machinery, so they can better carry out deep plowing and land preparation, improve soil, implement reasonable close planting, field management, and water conservancy construction, and many agricultural measures were difficult to achieve under the conditions of past human and animal power, but they were quickly achieved after mechanization was realized. This means that we must neither disregard the local natural conditions and the valuable experience in the original farming methods, nor should we lie on the inherent experience of the small-peasant economy and dare not move forward. We must use the revolutionary spirit of agricultural technological transformation to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in order to greatly improve labor productivity and greatly increase the commodity volume of agricultural and livestock products.

    Perhaps some people will say: "Youyi Farm and Luobei Farm have many machines and good machines, other farms cannot compare, cannot do it, and the rural people's communes dare not even think about it." What is the actual situation? In fact, the proportion of machines in many state-owned farms is not much different from that of these two farms. Taking the Hejiang area as an example, the proportion of machines in all large state-owned farms, in terms of the area of cultivated land borne by each standard tractor, is similar, and the proportion of machines in several farms is even greater than that of these two farms. From this, it can be seen that Youyi Farm and Luobei Farm can produce 80,000 to 100,000 jin of grain per person, and many farms can also do it, and should do it. Some rural people's communes have tractors, although the proportion of machines is still small, they can also follow the example of these two farms to make good use of machines, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, and carry out tool reform and complete sets of experiences. In fact, the grain productivity of some people's communes has rapidly increased due to the realization of mechanization and combined with tool reform. Youyi Farm and Luobei Farm are mainly engaged in mechanized farming, but they are by no means using machines without animal and human power. During the wheat harvest, when the No. 2 Team of the No. 5 Branch Farm of Youyi Farm harvested half of the wheat with combine harvesters, it was continuously raining, so it immediately organized the entire team's manpower, animal power, and machines to rush to harvest. Combine harvesters were used to harvest wheat on dry land, animal-powered harvesters were used to harvest wheat in places with water, and all people were used to rush to harvest wheat in places with deep water. The combination of human, machine, and animal power resulted in the complete recovery of the bumper wheat harvest.

    The conditions of state-owned farms are extremely superior, and it is fully possible to increase production greatly. The central issue is to give full play to subjective initiative, put politics in command, and carry out mass movements on a large scale.

    The various large state-owned farms in the Hejiang area have personally witnessed the facts of these two farms and are launching a "study, compare, catch up, and help" competition movement, striving for each agricultural laborer to produce about 80,000 jin of grain. The people's communes in the Hejiang area produce less than 10,000 jin of grain per agricultural laborer. Units that have realized mechanization will strive to produce 30,000 to 50,000 jin of grain this year, and some units have even proposed to reach 80,000 jin to catch up with Youyi Farm. The two farms also stated that they would never be complacent and would strive for each person to produce more than 100,000 jin of grain for the country, continue to seize the banner of mechanized production in state-owned farms, and play a greater demonstrative role for the rural people's communes to gradually realize mechanization.

    进一步发挥国营机械农场的示范作用
    中共黑龙江省合江地委第一书记农垦部副部长  张林池
    国营萝北农场第九分场每个农业工人，1959年生产粮食九万四千多斤，其中第一生产队每个农业工人，生产粮食十四万斤。粮食商品率达到80％到90％以上。这不仅是我们合江地区农业上的一件大事，也是我们黑龙江省农业上的一件大事。它们不仅给大规模的机械化的国营农场作出了良好的榜样，也给人民公社指出了实现农业机械化的前景。
    国营农场是大规模的农业企业，能够充分使用和有效地发挥机械化的作用，实现农业技术改造。因而，主要农作物的产量都高于当地农民。早在农业合作化初期，国营农场还带有试办性质，但已显示了它的优越性，对引导农民由个体经营走向大规模的集体经营，起了一定的示范作用。当时国营农场还用机器给附近农业生产合作社代耕、开荒，帮助训练技术干部；并直接供应了良种和优良种畜；在改革耕作制度、深耕、密植等贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”方面，起了一定的示范作用。
    农村已经实现了人民公社化，人民公社已经走上了巩固健全发展的道路。国营农场还有没有示范作用呢？有些人曾经有过这样的想法：以为过去由个体的小农经济走向集体经济，农场应该起示范、引导与促进的作用；现在人民公社化了，人民公社本身就是大规模的农业企业，而且是农林牧副渔的综合经营，工农商学兵互相结合，政社合一的组织了，农场不再需要起什么示范作用了。这是由于不了解目前农村人民公社仍然是集体所有制，农村人民公社现在还存在大量的手工劳动，今后即将进行全面的技术改造，实现机械化、现代化。
    国营农场是社会主义全民所有制的企业，在全国人民公社化运动中，国营农场也和人民公社一样，在农场内部实行了工、农、商、学、兵互相结合，在组织生产的同时又组织生活，实行国家在农村的基层政权机构和农场管理机构的合一。因此，国营农场实际上已经成为全民所有制的人民公社了。而人民公社目前还是集体所有制，因此，国营农场应该显示出社会主义全民所有制机械化生产的更大优越性，在机械化生产、劳动生产率、单位面积产量、产品成本、集体福利等方面，仍然应当起示范作用，帮助人民公社的发展，引导人民公社逐步向全民所有制过渡，将来还要向共产主义过渡。
    国营农场怎样对人民公社起示范作用呢？最根本的问题是充分发挥国营农场全民所有制的优越性，大大提高劳动生产率，为国家生产大量的农、畜产品，也就是大大增加交售给国家的农、畜产品率。农业是国民经济的基础，只有从事农业生产的人，生产出更多的粮食和工业原料，才能使更多的人从事其他各种生产建设，改变我国五亿人搞饭吃的局面。马克思曾经说：
  “超越劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础”，也同样是社会主义的基础。国营农场是全民所有制的农业企业，有巨大的优越性。去年萝北农场和友谊农场就是发挥了全民所有制机械化生产的优越性，大大提高了劳动生产率，为国家生产出大量的农、畜产品，对人民公社起了示范作用。
    为了大大地提高劳动生产率，为国家生产大量农畜产品，就必须在人民公社化的基础上实现以农业机械化为中心的农业技术改造。毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”中曾经说：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”我国农民几千年来，在提高农业生产上积累了丰富的耕作经验，这个经验的精华就是党中央和毛主席总结出来的农业“八字宪法”。实现农业机械化就能够在更高的水平上贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。友谊农场和萝北农场由于实现了机械化，又同当地耕作方法的条件相结合，对机具进行了改革，就可以更好地进行深耕整地、改良土壤、合理密植、田间管理和水利建设等，很多农业措施是过去人畜力条件下难以办到的，而实现机械化后就迅速地办到了。这就是既不能不顾当地自然条件与原有耕作方法中的宝贵经验，又不应躺在小农经济时代固有的经验上不敢前进，要用农业技术改造的革命精神来贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，才能大大地提高劳动生产率，大大地增加农畜产品商品量。
    也许有人会说：“友谊农场和萝北农场机器多，机器好，别的农场不能比，办不到，农村人民公社更不敢想。”实际情况如何呢？事实上很多国营农场的机器比重并不比这两个农场相差多少。就以合江地区来说，全部大型国营农场的机器比重以每标准台拖拉机负担耕地面积来说都不相上下，而且有几个农场的机器比重还大于这两个农场。由此可见，友谊农场和萝北农场能做到每人生产粮食八万到十万多斤，很多农场也能做到，而且应当做到。有些农村人民公社有了拖拉机，虽然机器比重还少，但是也可以仿效这两个农场使好机器，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大搞工具改革和配套成龙的经验。实际上有的人民公社由于实现了机械化并与改革工具相结合，粮食生产率就迅速地提高了。友谊农场、萝北农场是以机械化耕作为主，但决不是用机器不用畜力人力。友谊农场五分场二队在麦收期间用联合收割机收割一半的时候，阴雨连绵，就立即组织全队人力、畜力和机器突击抢收，在没有水的麦地上用联合收割机收割，有水的地方就用畜力收割机收割，水深的地方就全部用人来抢割，人、机、畜相结合，这才全部收回了丰收的小麦。
    国营农场的条件极其优越，有充分可能大增产，中心问题是充分发挥主观能动性，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。
    合江地区的各个大型国营农场亲眼看到了这两个农场的事实，正在展开一个“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛运动，争取每个从事农业生产的劳动力生产粮食八万斤左右。合江地区的人民公社每个农业劳动力生产不到一万斤粮食，实现了机械化的单位，今年就要争取生产粮食三至五万斤，有的单位还提出要达到八万斤，赶上友谊农场。这两个农场也表示决不自满，争取每个人为国家生产粮食十万斤以上，继续夺取国营农场机械化生产的标兵，为农村人民公社逐步实现机械化起更大的示范作用。
