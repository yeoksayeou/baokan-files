Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 12th: The news that U.S. President Eisenhower's advance man, White House Press Secretary Hagerty, was angrily besieged by the masses in Tokyo on the 10th triggered a farce in the White House: Almost all the American journalists and White House officials scheduled to accompany Eisenhower on his "visit" to Japan rushed to buy so-called "riot prevention" personal insurance policies from insurance company salesmen in the White House.

The news said that as soon as Hagerty's news arrived, an insurance company salesman immediately came to the White House press room. As a result, almost everyone rushed to buy this kind of insurance policy from him. The insurance policy stipulates that compensation will be paid for death, disability or injury.

    美国保险公司在白宫生意兴隆
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：10日，当美国总统的先行官、白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在东京遭到群众愤怒包围的消息传到华盛顿后，在白宫里演出了一幕滑稽戏：几乎所有预定要跟随艾森豪威尔去日本“访问”的美国记者和白宫官员纷纷向在白宫的保险公司推销员抢购所谓“防止暴乱”的人身保险单。
    消息说，当哈格蒂的消息传来后，立刻有一个保险公司的推销员来到了白宫的记者接待室。于是，几乎所有的人都向他抢购这种保险单。保险单上规定，如果遭到死亡、残废或受伤都可以得到赔偿。
