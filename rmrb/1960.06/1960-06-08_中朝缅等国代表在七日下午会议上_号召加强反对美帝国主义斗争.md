Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—At today's afternoon session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting, representatives from various countries' trade unions continued to speak.

    Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized in his speech that the working class must wage a resolute struggle against the tools of imperialism and the traitors of the working class—the modern revisionists represented by the Tito clique.
    He exposed and denounced the Tito clique, fostered by US imperialism, for particularly vigorously spreading the fallacy that the nature of imperialism has changed, and helping US imperialism deceive the people of the world. He said that the world workers' movement and trade union organizations in various countries cannot ignore this phenomenon. We must expose the US imperialist plot of "sham peace, real war preparation," so that workers and people understand that there should be no unrealistic illusions about US imperialism, and the sweet words of imperialism should never be believed.
    Liu Ningyi pointed out that US imperialism is the most important enemy of world peace, and its nature of aggression and plunder will never change. Only by uniting all peace-loving forces in the world to form the broadest united front and waging a resolute struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs can we stop war and safeguard world peace.
    Liu Ningyi emphasized that the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, have said that the world workers' movement, especially the socialist countries' sympathy and support for these people's struggles, means they don't want peace and "peaceful coexistence." On this issue, the Tito clique also came forward to help US imperialism, opposing the struggle for world peace to the national democratic movements and other people's struggles against imperialist oppression, and distorting the peaceful coexistence of the two social systems of socialism and capitalism into some kind of "sincere cooperation" that the oppressed and the oppressors should practice.
    He said that this is a lie to deceive the people. Everyone knows that the struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors is a life-and-death struggle; either you defeat me or I defeat you. Only by waging a resolute struggle against imperialist oppression can we benefit world peace and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.
    He said that in this struggle, the international workers' movement should pay attention to ensuring that its activities are beneficial to this struggle, not detrimental to it. It should educate workers and people to raise their vigilance against imperialism, rather than spreading illusions about imperialism among workers and people. For example, on the issue of "aid to underdeveloped countries," we must have a clear class stand and strictly distinguish between two completely different types of foreign aid in the world, namely, the foreign aid of socialist countries and the foreign "aid" of imperialist countries. Glorifying the so-called "aid" of imperialism and advocating that economically backward countries should welcome this kind of "aid" is actually helping imperialism, headed by the United States, to promote colonialism.
    Liu Ningyi's speech won prolonged and warm applause.
    Luciano Romagnoli, Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, said in his speech that he fully agreed with the lines and goals proposed in the two reports of the meeting, and would fight for easing international tensions, complete disarmament, and peaceful coexistence.
    Romagnoli said that the Italian General Confederation of Labor and workers must maximize their actions to eliminate all provocative and aggressive bases established in our country.
    Romagnoli expressed support for the heroic struggles of the Algerian and Black African peoples.
    Romagnoli believes that it should be emphasized that "the international situation is serious, and the whole world is facing the threat of the greatest danger." He said that it is this serious situation that requires the solidarity and fighting spirit of workers in all countries to develop.
    When talking about the issue of peace, he raised some views that he opposed. He said, "Some people believe that international tensions can be eased without struggle, and some people believe that the policy of easing tensions is a compromise to consolidate the status quo. Even some workers think this way. Some people think that the Soviet Union's abandonment of military superiority and missiles is too naive, and that the Soviet Union's policy of easing international tensions is a compromise with imperialism." Romagnoli said, "We have fought against similar positions."
    Romagnoli also believed that "in all countries, the struggle for coexistence is organically linked to the national goals of the proletariat, laborers, and the people." He explained that these goals are independence, economic and social liberation and development, democracy, and freedom.
    Romagnoli advocated that when it is said that imperialism is weak and the forces of peace are dominant, "do not draw simplistic conclusions." He said that imperialism is weak because the policies of all progressive forces have restrained it, and it will continue to weaken. Today we can be sure that its prospect is extinction. "However, imperialism is not equally weak everywhere; it can still do bad things in many places in the world. The working class and the working people should not underestimate the strength of the enemy, because underestimating the strength of the enemy will both weaken the struggle of the working class and its allies, and lead them to make risky decisions and take wrong measures."
    Peace Must Be Won Through Struggle
    People warmly applauded the speech by Park Sang-hong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, who pointed out the true path to safeguarding peace. He emphasized that peace must be achieved through struggle. The struggle to force US troops to withdraw from South Korea is also a struggle to safeguard peace.
    Park Sang-hong said that the anti-American patriotic uprisings held by the workers and people of South Korea have proved and are proving that as long as the people launch struggles to fight for freedom and the right to survival, then no matter who you are, you cannot stop their struggles. Through their heroic resistance struggle, the South Korean people have opened a huge gap in the US imperialist policy of aggression. This is a victory for the Korean people and also a victory for all anti-imperialist people.
    Park Sang-hong condemned US imperialism's continued crimes of creating new puppets in South Korea and further suppressing patriotic people. In the name of the Korean working class, he called on all workers in the world to stop US imperialism's interference in the just struggle of the workers and people of South Korea.
    Park Sang-hong said that US imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean nation. Due to the US imperialist policy of aggression, the reunification of Korea has still not been realized. He emphasized that the masters of Korea are the Korean people, and the destiny of Korea must be decided by the Korean people themselves. US imperialism must put away its atomic and rocket weapons and immediately withdraw from South Korea.
    Park Sang-hong suggested to this World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting that the upcoming June 25th—the day US imperialism launched the war of aggression in Korea ten years ago—be designated as the International Solidarity Week to support the just struggle of the Korean working class and people demanding the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.
    Park Sang-hong emphatically pointed out that US imperialism is the most aggressive and most ferocious imperialism, and Eisenhower is the number one war-monger. What it says about "peace" and "negotiations" is actually just a facade for pursuing a policy of war and aggression. A wolf cannot become a gentle sheep. US imperialism must be forced to withdraw from South Korea, forced to get out of Japan, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, and driven out of all regions of Asia and Africa. He said that this is a common task facing the working class and trade unions of all countries in this region.
    Gogo Nushi, Chairman of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, spoke, condemning the despicable provocative act of US imperialism sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, thereby undermining the highest-level meeting. He said that Albanian workers have never ignored the provocations and belligerent acts of imperialism and its running dogs. They are fighting with vigilance and will continue to fight more resolutely against monopoly capital groups, against colonialism, imperialism, and their running dogs.
    He said that the Albanian people and government warmly welcome the various proposals put forward by the Soviet government to defend peace and ease international tensions.
    Nushi said that the forces of peace are now stronger than ever, and they will surely defeat the forces of war. Of course, the path to peace may be long and difficult, so the struggle of the working people to win peace must be strengthened.
    US Imperialism's So-Called Peace and Negotiations Are Just Deceiving the People
    In his speech, Thakin Lwin, Chairman of the Burma Trade Union Congress, pointed out that although the imperialists verbally say that they want to negotiate for peace, they have never stopped their aggression and provocations. The facts show that they have no sincerity for peace. For US imperialism and its servants, who are carrying out policies of massacre and war, so-called peace and consultative negotiations are just deceiving the people and beautifying themselves.
    He emphasized that what is very important here is the brilliant struggle we are waging against imperialism. He said that today, workers in many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries have the confidence to bury imperialism by relying on the strength of international solidarity.
    Thakin Lwin said that the problem is very obvious: imperialism always threatens world peace, always exploits and deceives workers, and kills people who strive for liberation from their rule by any means. Therefore, the working people of the world must take further steps to resolutely overthrow imperialism.
    He condemned US imperialism for sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union and undermining the summit conference, and exposed US imperialism's crimes of organizing aggressive military blocs everywhere, signing military treaties, establishing military bases, supporting reactionary regimes everywhere, and suppressing the people.
    Thakin Lwin said that the achievements and unity of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have tolled the death knell for the exploitation system in other parts of the world. The working people of Asia have launched a glorious struggle to drive out US imperialism and its running dogs, and the struggles in Africa and Latin America have also made great progress. US imperialism and its running dogs are in a state of collapse and death in the world. The working people of Burma fully support the just struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and for national liberation.
    When talking about the important issues facing the working people of Burma, Thakin Lwin severely criticized the erroneous argument that trade unions can only become purely economic organizations. He said that the Burma Trade Union Congress believes that in order to improve living conditions, raise political awareness, defend workers' interests, and eliminate imperialism, workers need a leading political party. The Burma Trade Union Congress is conducting meaningful discussions among workers and organizing them to participate in political activities. The Burma Trade Union Congress is resolutely eliminating the view that trade unions should not be influenced by politics and can only become economic organizations.
    Representatives of trade unions from many economically underdeveloped countries sternly condemned US imperialism's policy of economic aggression.
    Mario Saenz Zumbado, Cultural Secretary of the Costa Rican Workers' General Confederation and Alternate Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, condemned US imperialism for making Costa Rica an underdeveloped semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Coffee is Costa Rica's main product, but US imperialism has lowered the price of coffee on the international market and at the same time hindered Costa Rica's trade with socialist countries, thereby bringing about an economic crisis in the country.
    Zumbado said that despite all kinds of oppression by US imperialism and domestic reactionaries, the Costa Rican trade union movement is developing in the direction of unified action. The general strike of banana plantation workers of the United Fruit Company in December last year is an example. In order to support the banana workers, municipal, insurance, and other industries held sympathy strikes. The Costa Rican trade union organization has also done a lot of work to support the Cuban revolution and oppose the atrocities of various dictatorial regimes in Latin America that persecute political prisoners.
    Luis Randolfo Banegas, the representative from Honduras, said at the meeting that imperialism prevents the industrial development of Honduras because it wants to plunder Honduras' raw materials and use local cheap labor. At the same time, the US State Department also controls the political affairs of Honduras.
    He said, the Honduran people's "anti-imperialist sentiment is growing day by day."
    The trade union representatives from Martinique and Guadeloupe, whose populations under French colonial rule are only 260,000 and 230,000 respectively, proudly announced at the meeting today that the working classes of Martinique and Guadeloupe have been bravely struggling despite the reactionary government's cruel suppression. The workers have realized that in order to truly improve their living conditions, they must first liberate themselves from the shackles of colonialism.
    They are Valbo Reina Renault, General Secretary of the Martinique Agricultural Workers' Union, and Nicolas Luger, General Secretary of the Guadeloupe Trade Union Federation, both from Central America. They introduced at the meeting that the economies of Martinique and Guadeloupe are typical colonial economies plundered by French colonizers. They single-mindedly grow sugarcane, bananas, and pineapples, and the lives of the working people are extremely impoverished.
    Joseph Grandgenet, General Secretary of the Luxembourg Free Trade Union Federation and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, spoke, expressing full agreement with the report on the first agenda item. He introduced the situation of the struggle of Luxembourg steel workers to increase wages at the meeting.
    Benito Sicra, Chairman of the Rio de Janeiro Metalworkers' Union in Brazil and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, said that the aerial aggression of the U-2 aircraft, especially the aggressive and provocative attitude of the North American leaders, in all aspects reminded us of the momentum that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor. But these have not scared us.
    Leon Mauvis, Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, said in his speech that war and peace are increasingly becoming a matter for the masses. Peace is won through struggle, and the vigilance of the people of all countries should not be relaxed in the slightest, so that the people's peaceful intentions can finally defeat the cold warriors in the United States, West Germany, France, and other countries.
    Mauvis said that the first wish of the French General Confederation of Labor is to increasingly powerfully raise the issue of the unity and action of the masses in the struggle for peace. The task of the members of the French trade union is to expose the provocations of the American leaders and the Pentagon, and to emphasize the dangerous consequences of these provocations for the people of all countries, to carry out a movement against the establishment of military bases by the United States and West Germany in France and elsewhere, to show people that France must pursue a policy of true independence, peace and national self-esteem, and at the same time to expose the various conspiracies of the de Gaulle government.
    He also said, "At the same time, we should continue our efforts to strive for peace in Algeria and for negotiations with the National Liberation Front in order to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination."
    He also emphasized, "Naturally, we have various difficulties, and you know these difficulties. They are of all kinds. These difficulties include the reflections of colonialism and nationalist ideologies, the exploitation of the military and political setbacks suffered by French imperialists since World War II until the Vietnam War, and the reactions caused by it, are not small."
    When talking about the summit conference, Mauvis said, "It would be futile and ridiculous to deny the great disappointment caused by the postponement of the summit conference in France."
    Regarding the sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, he made the following analysis: "What has just happened in Paris can only help to show more clearly the true situation regarding various conspiracies, activities, and provocations, show the strength possessed by the forces of war, and the forces that are hostile to the easing of international tensions, disarmament, and peaceful coexistence."

### 中朝缅等国代表在七日下午会议上  号召加强反对美帝国主义斗争

    中朝缅等国代表在七日下午会议上
    号召加强反对美帝国主义斗争
    据新华社7日讯　在世界工联理事会会议今日下午的讨论中，各国工会的代表继续在会上发言。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在发言中强调，工人阶级必须同帝国主义的工具、工人阶级的叛徒——以铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，进行坚决的斗争。
    他揭露和斥责受美帝国主义豢养的铁托集团特别起劲地散布帝国主义本性已经改变的谬论，帮助美帝国主义欺骗世界人民。他说，世界工人运动和各国工会组织不能忽视这种现象。我们必须揭穿美帝国主义实行“假和平、真备战”的阴谋，使工人和人民懂得：对美帝国主义不能有任何不切实际的幻想，帝国主义的甜言蜜语是永远也相信不得的。
    刘宁一指出，美帝国主义是世界和平的最主要的敌人，它的侵略和掠夺的本性是决不会改变的。只有全世界一切爱好和平的力量联合起来，结成最广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争，才能制止战争，维护世界和平。
    刘宁一强调指出，帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者曾说，世界工人运动特别是社会主义国家同情和支持这些人民斗争，就是不要和平，不要“和平共处”。铁托集团在这个问题上，也站出来帮美帝国主义的忙，把争取世界和平的斗争同反对帝国主义压迫的民族民主运动和其他各种人民斗争对立起来，把社会主义和资本主义两种社会制度的和平共处歪曲成为被压迫者和压迫者应当实行什么“真诚的合作”。
    他说，这是一种欺骗人民的谎言。谁都知道，被压迫者和压迫者之间的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争，不是你战胜我，就是我战胜你。只有同帝国主义的压迫进行坚决的斗争，才有利于世界和平，才有利于不同社会制度国家的和平共处。
    他说，在这个斗争中，国际工人运动应该注意自己的活动要对这个斗争有利，而不是对这个斗争不利，应该教育工人和人民提高对帝国主义的警惕，而不是在工人和人民中散播对帝国主义的幻想。例如，对于“援助不发达国家”的问题，我们就必须要有鲜明的阶级立场，把世界上两种性质完全不同的对外援助，即社会主义国家的对外援助和帝国主义国家的对外“援助”，严格地区别开来。美化帝国主义的所谓“援助”，主张经济落后国家应当欢迎这种“援助”，这实际上是帮助以美国为首的帝国主义来推销殖民主义。
    刘宁一的讲话博得了长时间的热烈掌声。
    世界工联理事、意大利总工会书记卢契安诺·罗马尼奥利在发言中表示，完全同意会议的两项报告所提出的路线和目标，为缓和国际紧张局势、全面裁军、以及和平共处而斗争。
    罗马尼奥利说，意大利总工会和工人要最大限度地加强行动，清除在我国设立的一切挑衅和侵略的基地。
    罗马尼奥利表示支持阿尔及利亚和黑非洲人民的英勇斗争。
    罗马尼奥利认为，应该强调“国际局势的严重化，全世界都遭到最大危险的威胁”。他说，正是这种严重局势要求世界各国工人的团结和战斗精神的发展。
    在谈到和平问题的时候，他提出了一些他所反对的看法。他说，“有些人认为可以不经过斗争就能缓和国际局势，还有些人认为缓和局势政策是为了巩固现状的一种妥协。甚至有些工人也这样想。有些人认为苏联放弃军事优势和导弹是过于天真的表现，苏联的缓和国际局势政策是同帝国主义的一种妥协”。罗马尼奥利说，“我们对类似的立场进行了斗争。”
    罗马尼奥利还这样认为：“在所有的国家里，争取共处的斗争，都有机地同无产阶级、劳动者和人民的民族目标联系在一起的”。他解释这种目标，就是独立、经济和社会解放与发展、民主和自由。
    罗马尼奥利主张，当说到帝国主义是软弱的，和平力量是占着上风的时候，“不要作出简单化的结论”。他说，帝国主义是弱的，因为所有进步力量的政策把它约束住了，它还将削弱下去，我们今天可以确信它的前景就是灭亡。“然而，帝国主义并非到处都是一样的弱小，它还可以在世界上许多地方作坏事。不应该使工人阶级和劳动人民低估敌人的力量，因为过低估计敌人的力量，既会使工人阶级及其同盟者减弱他们的斗争，又会使他们作出冒险的决定和采取错误的措施。”
    和平必须用斗争来争取
    人们热烈鼓掌欢迎朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长朴尚弘讲话，他在发言中指出了保卫和平的真正途径。他强调，和平必须用斗争来取得。迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的斗争，也就是维护和平的斗争。
    朴尚弘说，南朝鲜工人和人民举行的反美爱国起义，证明了并且正在证明：只要是人民掀起斗争，争取自由和生存权利，那么任你是谁，也阻挠不住他们的斗争。南朝鲜人民通过英勇的反抗斗争，给美帝国主义的侵略政策打开了一个巨大的缺口，这是朝鲜人民的胜利，同时也是所有反帝人民的胜利。
    朴尚弘谴责了美帝国主义继续在南朝鲜制造新的傀儡和进一步镇压爱国人民的罪行。他以朝鲜工人阶级的名义，呼吁全世界劳动者制止美帝国主义对于南朝鲜工人和人民正义斗争的干涉。
    朴尚弘说，美帝国主义是朝鲜民族不共戴天的死敌。由于美帝国主义的侵略政策，朝鲜的统一仍然未能实现。他强调说，朝鲜的主人是朝鲜人，朝鲜的命运必须由朝鲜人民自己来决定。美帝国主义必须收起它的原子和火箭武器，立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朴尚弘向这次世界工联理事会会议建议，把即将到来的6月25日——十年前美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争的日子，定为支援朝鲜工人阶级和人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜正义斗争国际团结周。
    朴尚弘强调地指出，美帝国主义是最富有侵略性、最凶恶的帝国主义，艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子。它嘴里讲什么“和平”和“谈判”，实际上不过是戴着假面具奉行战争和侵略政策。狼不可能变成温和的羊。必须迫使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜，迫使它滚出日本、台湾和南越，把它赶出亚非一切地区。他说，这是摆在这一地区所有国家工人阶级和工会面前的共同任务。
    世界工联理事、阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会主席果戈·努什发言，谴责美帝国主义派间谍飞机侵入苏联从而破坏最高级会议的卑鄙挑衅行为。他说，阿尔巴尼亚工人从来不忽视帝国主义及其走狗的挑衅和好战行为。他们以警惕的心情进行斗争，并将更坚决地继续斗争，来反对垄断资本集团，反对殖民主义、帝国主义和它们的走狗。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府热烈欢迎苏联政府为保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势所提出的各项建议。
    努什说，现在和平力量比以往任何时候都更为强大，它一定会战胜战争势力。当然，和平的途径可能是漫长的、困难的，因此，必须加强劳动人民争取和平的斗争。
    美帝国主义所谓和平和谈判，只不过是欺骗人民
    缅甸工会大会主席德钦伦的发言指出，帝国主义虽然口头上说为了和平要进行谈判，但是从未停止其侵略活动和挑衅。事实说明他们没有任何和平的诚意。对于本来就进行屠杀和战争政策的美帝国主义及其仆从来说，所谓和平和协商谈判，只不过是欺骗人民、装饰自己而已。
    他强调地说，这里十分重要的，是我们所进行的辉煌的反对帝国主义的斗争。他说，今天许多资本主义国家和殖民地半殖民地国家的工人，有信心依靠国际团结的力量来埋葬帝国主义。
    德钦伦说，问题很明显，帝国主义总要威胁世界和平，总要剥削和欺骗工人，并且不择手段地屠杀从他们的统治下争取解放的人民。因此，全世界劳动人民必须进一步采取步骤，坚决打倒帝国主义。
    他谴责美帝国主义派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联、破坏首脑会议的行为，并揭露了美帝国主义到处组织侵略性军事集团、签订军事条约、建立军事基地、到处扶植反动政权、镇压人民等等的罪行。
    德钦伦说，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家建设的成就和团结，给世界其他地区的剥削制度敲响了丧钟。亚洲劳动人民已经展开了赶走美帝国主义及其走狗的光辉斗争，非洲、拉丁美洲的斗争也有了巨大的发展。美帝国主义及其走狗在世界上已处于崩溃死亡的状态。缅甸劳动人民完全支持各国人民反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的正义斗争。
    德钦伦在谈到缅甸劳动人民面临的重要问题时，严厉批判了那种宣传工会只能成为纯粹的经济组织的错误论调。他说，缅甸工会大会认为，为了改善生活条件、提高政治觉悟、保卫工人利益和消灭帝国主义，工人需要有一个领导的政党。缅甸工会大会正在工人中进行有教育意义的讨论，并组织他们参加政治活动。缅甸工会大会正在坚决肃清所谓工会不受政治影响而只能成为经济组织的观点。
    许多经济不发达国家的工会代表，严正谴责了美帝国主义的经济侵略政策。
    世界工联候补理事、哥斯达黎加工人总工会文化书记马里奥·萨恩兹·宗巴多谴责说，美帝国主义使哥斯达黎加沦为半封建半殖民地的不发达国家。咖啡是哥斯达黎加的主要产品，但是美帝国主义压低了国际市场咖啡的价格，同时又阻挠哥斯达黎加同社会主义国家进行贸易，从而给这个国家带来了经济危机。
    宗巴多说，尽管有美帝国主义和国内反动派的种种压迫，哥斯达黎加的工会运动还是朝着统一行动的方向发展。去年12月爆发的美国联合果品公司香蕉园工人的总罢工就是一个例证。为了声援香蕉工人，市政、保险业和其他行业的职工都举行了同情罢工。哥斯达黎加工会组织还做了许多工作，来声援古巴革命和反对拉丁美洲各独裁政权迫害政治犯的暴行。
    洪都拉斯代表路易斯·兰道尔夫·巴涅加斯在会上说，帝国主义由于要掠夺洪都拉斯的原料和利用当地廉价的劳动力，使洪都拉斯的工业不能发展。同时，美国国务院也控制着洪都拉斯的政治事务。
    他说，洪都拉斯人民的“反帝情绪正在一天天地高涨”。
    在法国殖民统治下的人口分别只有二十六万和二十三万的马提尼克和瓜德罗普的工会代表，今天在会上自豪地宣布说：马提尼克、瓜德罗普的工人阶级不顾反动政府的残酷镇压，一直在英勇地进行着斗争。工人们已经意识到为了真正地改善他们的生存条件，必须首先从殖民主义的束缚下解放出来。
    他们是来自中美洲的马提尼克农业工人联合会总书记瓦尔博·雷纳·雷诺和瓜德罗普工会联盟总书记尼科拉·吕热。他们在会上介绍说，马提尼克和瓜德罗普的经济，是法国殖民者掠夺下的典型的殖民地经济，它们单一地种植甘蔗、香蕉和菠萝，劳动人民的生活异常贫困。
    世界工联理事、卢森堡自由工会联合会总书记约瑟夫·格朗德热涅发言，表示完全同意第一项议程的报告。他在会上介绍了卢森堡钢铁工人为提高工资而斗争的情况。
    世界工联理事、巴西里约热内卢五金工会主席比尼迪图·西克拉说，U—2型飞机的空中侵略，尤其是北美领导人的侵略和挑衅态度，在各方面都使得我们忆起导致珍珠港侵略的那种气势。但是这些并没有吓倒我们。
    世界工联理事、法国总工会书记莱昂·摩维在发言中说，战争和和平日益变成群众的问题。和平是争取得来的，各国人民的警惕性不应该有丝毫的放松，以便人民和平的意图能够最后战胜美国、西德、法国和其他国家的冷战分子。
    摩维说，法国总工会的第一个愿望就是日益有力地提出争取和平的群众的团结和行动问题。法国工会会员的任务，是揭露美国领导人和五角大楼的挑衅，并且强调指出这些挑衅对各国人民的危险后果，开展反对美国和西德在法国和其他地方建立军事基地的运动，向人们表明法国必须奉行真正独立、和平和民族自尊的政策，同时揭露戴高乐政府的各种阴谋。
    他又说，“与此同时，我们应该继续努力争取阿尔及利亚实现和平、争取和民族解放阵线谈判，以便承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权力。”
    他还这样强调，“自然，我们有各种困难，你们知道这些困难。它们是各种各样的。这些困难中包括殖民主义和民族主义意识形态的反映，法国帝国主义者自从第二次世界大战直到越南战争时所遭受的军事和政治的挫折，这种挫折的被利用和所引起的反应，是不算小的。”
    摩维在谈到首脑会议问题时说，“如果否认首脑会议的延期在法国所引起的巨大失望，那是徒劳和可笑的。”
    对于四大国首脑会议的被破坏，他作了这样的分析：“在巴黎刚刚发生的事情，只能更有助于显示出关于各种阴谋、活动和挑衅的真实情况，显示出战争势力所拥有的力量，以及敌视国际局势缓和、裁减军备和和平共处的势力的力量。”
