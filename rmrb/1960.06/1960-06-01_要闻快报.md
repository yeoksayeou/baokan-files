		News in Brief
		Freight Trucks Implement Timed Shuttle Circular Transportation
		The workers of the Tianjin No. 2 Automobile Transportation Depot have further strengthened internal and external cooperation and actively organized a Red Flag timed shuttle transportation line to complete larger transportation tasks in the shortest time, with the least transportation capacity and the lowest fuel consumption. The method is based on "six fixed and five on-site" (fixed personnel, fixed vehicles, fixed trailers, fixed points, fixed routes, fixed tasks; on-site parking, on-site refueling, on-site repair, on-site office, on-site shift change) and the "one-stop" cooperation of production, transportation and sales. According to the law of cargo flow and direction, several material distribution centers are linked together to form a circular transportation line, like trains and buses, with fixed vehicles and scheduled driving. According to preliminary statistics, after the implementation of this method, the average daily output per vehicle-ton of each timed shuttle reached 380 ton-kilometers, which is more than one-third higher than that of ordinary vehicles, effectively supporting production, and drivers can also achieve a balance of work and rest.
		
		Shanxi Counties and Communes Vigorously Build Fiberboard Factories
		Shanxi Province is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of wood with fiberboard as the center. At present, a total of 224 fiberboard manufacturing factories have been built in the province, and 758 tons of various fiberboards and particleboards have been produced. Various localities have also built more than 100 forest chemical factories producing baked glue, rosin, wood flour, vinegar stone, aromatic oil, etc., and have produced a large number of baked glue and rosin, and have successfully trial-produced more than 20 kinds of forest chemical products. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction and other relevant units jointly convened a provincial on-site conference on forestry industry, requiring all counties and people's communes to build 1,200 artificial fiberboard factories by the end of September through self-reliance, producing 50,000 tons of fiberboard, 150 tons of rosin, 250 tons of baked glue, and 600 tons of pulp.
		
		Three-Story Building Built with "Waste"
		The Tianjin Municipal Construction Department recently built a building with industrial "waste." This is the product of Tianjin's vigorous efforts in comprehensive resource utilization.
		
		This three-story building has a total area of more than 1,600 square meters. It is built with porous core silicate blocks and high-strength foam silicate blocks made of slag, fly ash, and mineral slag. These types of blocks are lighter than concrete and bricks of the same volume, but have the same strength as ordinary concrete and higher strength than bricks. The amount of construction work is greatly reduced. It is warm in winter and cool in summer, making it very comfortable to live in.
		
		Inner Mongolia Promotes Five Major Measures to Save Pit Props
		The vast number of workers on the Inner Mongolia coal industry front have firmly grasped the five basic measures of reform (improving coal mining methods), recovery (improving the recovery rate of pit props), substitution (promoting pit prop substitutes), management (strengthening pit prop management), and comprehensive utilization of pit props, and vigorously carried out a great revolution in coal mining with less or no pit props. From January to April of this year, the region's pit prop consumption was reduced by 27% compared with the actual consumption quota for the entire year of last year, saving 10,000 cubic meters of wood. This wood can be used to build more than 13,000 square meters of houses.
		
		Cured Tobacco Factory Produces More Than Ten Kinds of Products
		The Shandong Weifang Cured Tobacco Factory vigorously promotes comprehensive utilization of equipment and resources and develops diversified operations. It has now developed from a single production to being able to produce more than ten kinds of products. The factory's six major wastes, including flue dust, sorghum stalk curtains, slag, coal stone, broken mats, and oil sludge, have become treasures. Due to the vigorous development of diversified operations, more than 2,000 employees in the factory have mastered more than three production technologies, of which more than 400 have mastered more than five production technologies. From January to the first ten days of May, the factory's total sideline output value increased by 13 times compared with the entire year of last year, and the profit more than doubled the total profit of last year.

    运货汽车实行定时班车循环运输
    天津市汽车运输二场职工进一步加强内外协作，积极组织一条龙红旗定时班车运输线，用最短的时间、最少的运力和最低的油耗，完成更大的运输任务。办法是在“六定五现”（定人、定车、定拖斗、定点、定线、定任务；现场驻车、现场加油、现场修车、现场办公、现场接班）和产、运、销“一条龙”大协作的基础上，按照货源流量和流向的规律，把几个物资集散点衔接起来，编成循环运输线，像火车和公共汽车一样，固定车辆，定时行驶。据初步统计，实行这一办法后，每个定时班车的车吨日产平均达到三百八十吨公里，比一般汽车提高三分之一以上，有力地支援了生产，司机也能做到有劳有逸。
    山西各县社大办纤维板厂
    山西省以纤维板为中心大搞木材综合利用。目前，全省共建成二百二十四座纤维板制造工厂，已生产出各种纤维板、刨花板七百五十八吨。各地还建成烤胶、松香、木粉、醋石、芳香油等林产化学工厂一百多座，已生产出大批烤胶、松香，并试制成功了二十多种林产化学产品。最近山西省农业建设厅等有关单位联合召开了全省森林工业现场会议，要求各县和人民公社在9月底以前自力更生建成一千二百个人造纤维板工厂，生产纤维板五万吨，松香一百五十吨，烤胶二百五十吨，纸浆六百吨。
    用“废料”盖起三层大楼
    天津市建筑部门最近用工业“废料”建成一幢楼房。这是天津市大搞资源综合利用的产物。
    这幢三层楼房共一千六百多平方米。它是用炉渣、粉煤灰、矿渣等制成的多孔心硅酸盐砌块和高强泡沫硅酸盐砌块建成的。这类砌块比同样体积的混凝土和砖块重量轻，而强度和一般混凝土相同，比砖块的强度高。建筑施工工作量大大减少。住起来冬暖夏凉，很舒适。
