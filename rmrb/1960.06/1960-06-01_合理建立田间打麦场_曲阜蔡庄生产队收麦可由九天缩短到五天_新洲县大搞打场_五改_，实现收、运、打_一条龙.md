Editor's Note: Rationally setting up field threshing grounds and comprehensively renovating old ones are important measures to speed up the summer harvest and avoid grain scattering and waste. The practices of Qufu and Xinzhou counties have yielded immediate results and are worth learning from in various places.

This newspaper reports Shandong Qufu County Chenzhuang Commune Cai Village Production Team, with the help of the mathematics department of Qufu Normal College, has mastered and applied the "optimal positioning method" to rationally set up the location of wheat threshing grounds, which can greatly shorten the transportation distance and save labor, animal power, and tools. According to the plan, the team's wheat harvesting task can be shortened from the original nine days to five days.

The production team originally had only one threshing ground, located at the head of the village, with the farthest wheat field more than five li away. Now, using the scientific principles of the "optimal positioning method," they conducted a survey of the team's wheat field area, road distribution, and the growth of each wheat field, and calculated the amount of wheat transported from each field. Then, based on the size of the wheat transportation volume, adhering to the three principles of small fields moving closer to large fields, branch roads moving closer to trunk roads, and both ends moving closer to the middle, while also taking into account natural conditions such as water wells, terrain, and distance from the village, they added a new threshing ground more than one li away from the village. The new threshing ground serves as the main threshing ground, undertaking the task of drying and threshing eight hundred mu of wheat. The original threshing ground remains as an auxiliary threshing ground to harvest wheat around the village. In this way, the average transportation distance of wheat is shortened from the original 1.5 li to 0.85 li; the total transportation distance is reduced from the original 458.3 ton-kilometers to 259 ton-kilometers. Moreover, 267 mu of wheat no longer require specially organized labor and vehicles for transportation, and can simply be carried by the labor force participating in the wheat harvest when returning to the cafeteria for meals. This alone can save 53 laborers, and the team's wheat harvesting workdays can be reduced by 376 compared to the original. In this way, the wheat harvesting time can be shortened from the originally planned nine days to five days. Due to the shortening of the transportation distance, the loss rate of wheat transportation will also be greatly reduced.

Although it is still necessary to transport the threshed wheat grains and wheat straw back to the village in the end, the weight of the wheat grains and wheat straw is greatly reduced after drying and threshing. More importantly, it can shorten the wheat harvesting time, overcome the contradiction of the large workload of the summer harvest and the shortage of labor, animal power, and tools, and gain the initiative in the work.

This newspaper reports that Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, has adopted a unified planning, rational deployment, and unified action approach, and vigorously carried out "five improvements" to threshing grounds (small to large, dispersed to concentrated, village-side to field-side, low to high, loose to solid). At present, the county has built 1,580 new-style field threshing grounds, 359 three-earth (clay, lime, fine sand mixture) threshing grounds, and has expanded and newly built more than 500 field roads in conjunction with paddy field reforms, achieving a "one-stop" system of harvesting, transportation, and threshing.

The 597 production teams in Xinzhou County originally had mostly small, scattered threshing grounds left over from the small-scale peasant economy of individual households, and most were distributed in various villages and production teams. The foundation soil quality of these rice fields was very poor, uneven, and with many cracks. When it rained, it was "a mass of slurry," and it could not be used for one or two days after the rain stopped. A lot of grain was wasted when it fell into the cracks during threshing, and it was easy for stacked grain to become damp and moldy. After analyzing this situation, the Xinzhou County Party Committee increasingly felt the urgent need to implement a rice field revolution, and resolutely promoted the five reforms of rice fields. These new threshing grounds are generally flat, solid, and built in dry, draining, and sunny places; large ditches have been dug around the threshing grounds, and two to five one-foot-high earth platforms have been made on the threshing grounds to facilitate wheat stacking and prevent damage from chickens and pigs. Some fields have also built sheds to facilitate rest, entertainment, and shade for the cattle; some threshing grounds have established temporary warehouses nearby to facilitate threshing and drying at the same time, which is conducive to rushing to prevent rain and unified storage. Large manure piles are generally established at the edge of the field, and wheat ears and wheat husks can be used on the spot to build fertilizer piles. (Photo attached)

### 合理建立田间打麦场  曲阜蔡庄生产队收麦可由九天缩短到五天  新洲县大搞打场“五改”，实现收、运、打“一条龙”

    合理建立田间打麦场
    曲阜蔡庄生产队收麦可由九天缩短到五天
    新洲县大搞打场“五改”，实现收、运、打“一条龙”
    编者按：合理地设置田间打场、全面改造旧有打场是加快夏收进度和避免粮食抛撒浪费的重要措施之一。曲阜、新洲县的做法已收到立竿见影的效果，值得各地学习。
    本报讯　山东曲阜县陈庄公社蔡庄生产队，在曲阜师范学院数学系师生的帮助下，掌握和运用了“最优置定位法”，合理地设置了麦场位置，可以大大缩短运输里程，节省劳力、畜力和工具，根据计划可使全队麦收任务由原来需要九天左右完成，缩短到五天完成。
    这个生产队原来只有一个麦场，设置在村头上，最远的麦田距麦场五华里多。现在运用“最优置定位法”的科学原理，对全队的麦田面积、道路分布和每片麦子的生长情况，进行摸底排队，计算出每片麦田小麦的运输量；然后根据各片小麦运输量的大小，本着小往大处靠、支路往干道靠、两端往中间靠的三个原则，同时又要考虑到水井、地势、离村远近等自然条件，增设了一个离村约有一里多路的新麦场。新麦场作为主要麦场，负担八百亩小麦的晒打任务。原来的麦场仍然保留，作为辅助麦场。以便收打村周围的小麦。这样，小麦的平均运输里程由原来的一点五华里，缩短到零点八五华里；总的运输里程由原来需要四百五十八点三吨公里，降低到二百五十九吨公里。并且其中还有二百六十七亩小麦不需要再专门组织劳力、车辆运输，只要参加麦收的劳力回食堂吃饭时捎带下即可。仅这一项就可节省出五十三名劳动力，全队的麦收工日比原来可节省三百七十六个。这样，就可使麦收时间由原计划的九天缩短到五天。由于运输里程的缩短，运麦的损耗率也将会大大降低。
    就地建场，虽然最后还需要把打好的麦粒和麦秸运回村来，但麦粒和麦秸经过晒打后，重量大大减轻，更重要的是可以缩短麦收时间，克服夏收工作量大和劳力畜力工具不足的矛盾，争得工作的主动。
    本报讯　湖北新洲县采取统一规划，合理部署，统一行动的办法，大搞打场“五改”（小改大，分散改集中，塆边改田间，低改高，松泡改坚固）。目前全县修建新式的田间大打场一千五百八十个，三合土（粘土、石灰、细沙混合）打场三百五十九个，并结合稻场改革扩建、新建五百多条田间大路，实现了收割、运输、打场“一条龙”。
    新洲全县五百九十七个生产队，原来绝大部分打场都是小农经济单家独户遗留下来的小型、分散的打场，而且多分布在各个塆村和生产队里。这些稻场的基础土质很坏，高低不平，裂缝很多，下雨就是“一团浆”，雨住后一两天还不能使用，打场时粮食掉进裂缝里浪费多，堆码粮食容易受潮霉烂。新洲县委分析了这种情况以后，愈来愈感到实行稻场大革命的迫切需要，坚决推行了稻场的五项改革。这些新打场一般都平坦、坚固，兴建在干燥、滤水、向阳的地方；打场周围都开了大沟，打场上做了二至五个一尺高的土台，便于麦子堆码，防鸡猪为害。有些场还搭了凉棚，便于社员休息、娱乐、耕牛歇荫；有些打场附近建立了临时仓库，便于边打、边晒，有利于抢雨防雨、统一入库。场边一般都建立了大粪垱，麦穗麦壳可以就地窖垱造肥积肥。（附图片）
