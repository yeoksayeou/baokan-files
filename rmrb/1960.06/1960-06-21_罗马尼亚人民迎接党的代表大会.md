    Romanian People Greet the Party Congress
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    Recently, a batch of brand-new electric locomotives will begin the first step of their thousands of miles journey on Romanian soil; and a ship with a displacement of 4,500 tons will sail from the Danube into the boundless Black Sea.
    These are the first products made by the Romanian working people with their own diligence and wisdom; these are two of the thousands of gifts they have dedicated to the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party. These two gifts symbolize the bright and far-reaching development prospects pointed out by the Romanian Workers' Party to the people of the whole country, and symbolize the will and confidence of the working people to accelerate socialist construction.
          Grand Construction Plan
    For nearly a month, the Romanian people have been enthusiastically discussing the draft directives of the Third National Congress of the Workers' Party on the National Economic Development Plan for 1960-1965 and the Long-Term National Economic Development Plan to 1975. This draft directive summarizes the tremendous achievements in socialist construction since the Second Party Congress held at the end of 1955 and formulates a program of action for future economic and cultural development.
    The draft directive stipulates that the basic task of the six-year economic plan for 1960-1965 is to develop the material and technical foundation of socialism and rapidly increase productivity in order to complete socialist construction in Romania. By 1965, the total industrial output value will increase by 1.1 times compared with 1959, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 13%. During the period from 1956 to 1959, the entire industrial production increased by approximately 45%, with an average annual growth rate of 10%.
    Electricity production will continue to lead the way in the future industrial development; the output in 1965 will increase from more than 6.8 billion kilowatt-hours in 1959 to 18.5 billion kilowatt-hours, which is an increase of 1.7 times. During the six-year plan period, the steel industry will continue to be a project that receives special attention. By 1965, the output of steel, steel products, and pig iron will more than double that of 1959. An important project during this period is the construction of an iron and steel complex with an annual output of 4 million tons of steel in Galati on the Danube River. The steel production capacity of this enterprise is several times larger than that of Romania's current largest iron and steel complex.
    The six-year plan stipulates that the production of the machine-building industry will increase by 1.2 times compared with 1959.
    By 1965, the total output value of the chemical, rubber, fiber, and paper industries will increase by 2.3 times compared with 1959, of which plastics and synthetic resins will increase by more than 15 times.
    According to the six-year plan, agriculture will develop rapidly. During this period, collectivization will be completed. The total agricultural output value in 1965 will increase by 70% to 80% compared with 1959.
    During the six-year plan period, the task of universalizing seven-year education will be completed, and the transition to eight-year general education will begin, while a large number of technical cadres at all levels will be trained. By 1965, the real wages of workers and staff will increase by 40% to 50% compared with the level in the second half of 1959, and the real income of peasants will increase by about 40%.
    From the simple figures above, one can see the speed and scale of Romania's socialist construction during the six-year plan period. The six-year plan is the first stage of the long-term economic development plan to 1975. The long-term economic development plan presents an even grander construction picture. By 1975, industrial production will increase fivefold compared with 1959, and agricultural production will increase nearly twofold. By then, Romania will complete socialist construction and gradually transition to communist construction.
    In the process of discussing the draft directives of the "Third Congress" of the Workers' Party, the Romanian people, whether reviewing the past or looking forward to the future, expressed their infinite gratitude and trust in their beloved party. Tens of thousands of people spoke during the discussion of the draft directives. They stated that they would firmly move forward along the path pointed out by the party and were determined to make the greatest contribution to the realization of the glorious tasks put forward in the draft directives.
              Gifts Dedicated to the Party Congress
    Since the beginning of this year, the Romanian working people have launched a warm production competition movement to ensure that they greet the historic Party Congress with new production achievements. The publication of the draft directives has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the working people. This year's socialist production competition movement has already achieved great success. So far, many industrial and mining enterprises have completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, fulfilling the guarantees made for the Party Congress.
    The Martin furnace workshop and electric furnace workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine completed their production plans for the first half of the year twenty days ahead of schedule. The steelworkers of this enterprise shortened the time for smelting each furnace of steel by one and a half hours compared with last year, and also saved 5 million lei (Romanian currency). The workers in the second steelmaking workshop showed particularly high labor enthusiasm. For example, Anak, who works at Martin furnace No. 3, goes to work half an hour early every day to check the condition of the steelmaking furnace. This workshop overproduced more than 1,200 tons of steel in one day on June 5, setting the highest daily overproduction record.
    Many industrial and mining enterprises have realized their guarantees for welcoming the "Third Congress" ahead of schedule in terms of saving raw materials. The Bucharest Cotton Mill saved 5,200 kilograms of cotton yarn. The "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" Garment Factory saved clothing materials that could make 48,000 garments, and the "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory saved metal that could manufacture 150 tractors.
    The agricultural workers of the national state farms and machine tractor stations also launched a production competition movement to welcome the Party Congress. At present, they are working hard on weeding, fertilizing summer crops, and preparing for the summer harvest. They guarantee to carry out the summer harvest in a timely manner without losing any grain.
    The Third Congress of the Workers' Party is about to open, and the production competition movement to welcome the Party Congress has reached its climax. In order to realize the six-year plan, especially to complete this year's production plan, the Romanian working people will continue to promote the production competition movement to a new stage with full production enthusiasm.

    罗马尼亚人民迎接党的代表大会
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    最近，将有一批崭新的电气机车在罗马尼亚的土地上开始它们的千万里行程的第一步；还将有一艘排水量四千五百吨的轮船从多瑙河驶进无边的黑海。
    这是罗马尼亚劳动人民凭着自己的勤劳和智慧，首次制造的产品；这是他们为迎接罗马尼亚工人党的第三次代表大会而献出的千千万万件礼品中的两件。这两件礼品象征着罗马尼亚工人党向全国人民指出的光辉、远大的发展前景，象征着劳动人民对加速社会主义建设的意志和信心。
          宏　伟　的　建　设　计　划
    近一个月来，罗马尼亚全国人民热烈地讨论了工人党第三次全国代表大会关于1960—1965年的国民经济发展计划和到1975年的国民经济发展远景规划的指示草案。这个指示草案总结了自1955年底举行第二次党代会以来所取得的巨大的社会主义建设成就，为今后经济文化的发展拟定了行动纲领。
    指示草案规定，1960—1965年的六年经济计划的基本任务是，为在罗马尼亚完成社会主义建设而发展社会主义的物质技术基础，迅速提高生产力。到1965年，工业生产总值将比1959年增加一点一倍，每年平均的增长速度大约是13％。而在1956年到1959年期间，整个工业生产约增长了45％，每年的平均增长速度是10％。
    电力生产在今后的整个工业发展中，仍将健步先行；1965年的产量将由1959年的六十八亿多度增加到一百八十五亿度，也就是增长一点七倍。在六年计划期间，钢铁工业继续是特别注意发展的项目。到1965年，钢、钢材和生铁的产量都将比1959年增加一倍以上。在这期间的一项重要工程是在多瑙河畔的卡拉茨兴建一座年产四百万吨钢的钢铁联合企业。这个企业的产钢能力比罗马尼亚目前全国最大的钢铁联合企业还大好几倍。
    六年计划规定，机器制造工业的生产将比1959年增长一点二倍。
    到1965年，化学、橡胶、纤维和造纸工业的总产值将比1959年增长二点三倍，其中的塑料和合成树脂将增长十五倍多。
    按照六年计划的规定，农业将有飞速发展。在这期间将完成集体化工作。1965年的农业总产值将比1959年增长70％到80％。
    在六年计划期间，将完成普及七年制教育的工作，并开始过渡到八年制普通教育，同时大量培养各级技术干部。到1965年，职工实际工资将比1959年下半年的水平提高40％到50％，农民的实际收入将增长40％左右。
    单是从上面的一些简单数字就可看出罗马尼亚社会主义建设在六年计划期间的速度和规模。六年计划是到1975年的经济发展远景规划的第一阶段。经济发展远景规划向人们展示的是一幅更加宏伟的建设图景。到1975年，工业生产将比1959年增长五倍，农业生产增长近两倍。届时，罗马尼亚将完成社会主义建设，逐步向共产主义建设过渡。
    罗马尼亚人民在讨论工人党“三大”指示草案的过程中，不论回顾过去还是展望将来，都对自己所热爱的党表示了无限的感激和信赖。成千成万的人在讨论指示草案时发了言。他们表示，要坚定地沿着党所指出的道路向前迈进，决心为实现指示草案提出的光荣任务作出最大贡献。
              献　给　党　代　会　的　礼　物
    罗马尼亚劳动人民从今年开始以来就展开了热烈的生产竞赛运动，保证用新的生产成就迎接具有历史意义的党代会。指示草案公布后，更加鼓舞了劳动人民的生产热情。今年的社会主义生产竞赛运动已经获得了巨大的成就。到目前为止，已经有许多工矿企业提前完成了上半年的生产计划，实现了为迎接党代会提出的保证。
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的马丁炉车间、电炉车间都提前二十天完成了上半年的生产计划。这个企业的炼钢工人们把炼每炉钢的时间比去年缩短了一个半小时，还节约了五百万列伊（罗币）。第二炼钢车间的工人们表现了特别高涨的劳动热情。例如，在三号马丁炉工作的阿纳克每天都提前半小时上班，检查炼钢炉的情况。这个车间在6月5日一天中就超计划生产了一千二百多吨钢，创造了最高的日超产纪录。
    许多工矿企业在节约原材料方面提前实现了为迎接“三大”提出的保证。布加勒斯特棉纺厂节约了五千二百公斤棉纱。“乔治乌—德治”服装工厂节约了可以做四万八千件衣服的衣料，“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂节约了可以制造一百五十台拖拉机的金属。
    全国国营农场和机器拖拉机站的农业工人们也为迎接党代表大会开展了生产竞赛运动。目前，他们正在紧张地进行夏季作物的除草、施肥工作和夏收的准备工作。他们保证及时进行夏收工作，不丢失粮食。
    工人党第三次代表大会就要开幕了，迎接党代会的生产竞赛运动达到了高潮。为了实现六年计划，特别是为了完成今年的生产计划，罗马尼亚劳动人民将继续以饱满的生产热情把生产竞赛运动推向一个新的阶段。
