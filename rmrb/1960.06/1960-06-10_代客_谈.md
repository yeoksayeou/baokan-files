    "Serving Customers" Talk
    Lü Chaohai
    During the Great Leap Forward, people talked a lot about the word "compete," competing in determination, competing in drive, competing in measures, and competing in results, holding grand competitions. The mass movement of learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping currently underway is a new form of socialist grand competition. Competition has promoted the leap forward development of production and construction. After the grand competitions, the masses' enthusiasm is growing, the society's products and output are increasing, and the people's lives are getting better and better.
    Recently, in the Huaiyin City Department Store, I saw a large string of "serve" characters again. On the sales counters were posted signs saying "serve customers" by sewing quilt linings, sewing on buttons, knitting woolen sweaters, selecting goods, calculating fabric sizes, processing fabrics, and so on. In the stationery counter, it was written: "serve customers" by engraving fountain pens, attaching fountain pen sacs, threading basketball laces… In the hardware counter, it was written: "serve customers" by installing bicycle tassels, installing bicycle locks, installing safety forks… Perhaps these few "serve" characters are nothing, just a little extra effort to provide customers with some convenience. But please read on, there is much more to the story behind these "serve" characters! Serving customers by delivering goods to their door, hiring vehicles for them, mailing packages for them, handling consignment for them, purchasing gifts for them, calculating accounts for them, storing items for them, and so on. This is no longer just a matter of putting in a little extra effort.
    The "serving customers…" work done by all the comrades of the Huaiyin City Department Store is an inevitable product of the rising communist spirit of the people after the Great Leap Forward. Please read on. They also serve customers by remitting money, mailing letters, subscribing to newspapers and magazines, and serving customers in countless other ways. The Great Leap Forward and the nationwide rectification movement have given our nation a completely new spiritual outlook, and the relationship between people has entered a new era. People deeply understand the true meaning of the communist spirit of "everyone for me, I for everyone": serving the people is serving oneself. Individual true happiness is rooted in the collective happiness. Making others live better has become the ideal and purpose pursued by people today.
    The vigorous development of socialist social productive forces has strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation among the people, bringing about tremendous changes in the relationships between people. In the struggle against nature, the people have seen the power of the collective. They care for the collective and love the collective. In the happy big family of the motherland, they try every means to better serve the collective. "Serving customers…" is a reflection of this glorious and brilliant people's spiritual outlook.

### “代客”谈

    “代客”谈
    吕超海
    大跃进中，人们大谈“比”字，比决心、比干劲、比措施、比成果，大赛大比。当前开展的学、赶、超、帮的群众运动，就是社会主义大赛大比的一种新形式。比，促进了生产建设的飞跃发展。大赛大比之后，群众的干劲越来越大，社会的产品和产量越来越多，人民的生活越来越好。
    最近，在淮阴市百货公司里，又看到一大串的“代”字。在售货柜上，贴着代客缝被里，代客钉钮扣，代客织毛线衣，代客挑选商品，代客算衣料尺码，代客加工衣料等等的字条。在文具柜上，写着代客钢笔刻字，代客上钢笔皮管，代客穿篮球带……。在五金柜上写着代客装自行车毛球，代客装自行车锁，代客装保险叉……。也许这里几个“代”字算不得什么，只是稍稍费些手脚，给顾客一些方便而已。请看下去吧，这些“代”字下边的文章多着哩！代客送货上门，代客雇车，代客邮寄包裹，代客办托运，代客采办礼品，代客算账，代客保存物件，等等。这样，就不是稍稍费些手脚的问题了。
    淮阴市百货公司全体职工同志所做的“代客……”的工作，是生产大跃进后人民群众的共产主义风格高涨的必然产物。请再看下去吧。他们还代客汇款，代客寄信，代客订报刊杂志，代客……，简直是数不胜数。大跃进和全民的整风运动，使我们民族的精神面貌焕然一新，人与人之间的关系进入了一个新的时代。人们深深懂得“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义风格的真谛：为人民服务就是为自己服务。个人的真正幸福是寄寓于集体的幸福之中的。使别人生活得更好，已成为今日人们所追求的理想和旨趣。
    社会主义社会生产力的蓬勃发展，加强了人民之间的互助和协作，使人与人之间的关系发生巨大的变革。人民在向大自然斗争的场合中，看到了集体的力量。他们关怀集体，热爱集体。在祖国幸福的大家庭里，他们想方设法更好地为集体服务。“代客……”就是这种光辉灿烂的人民精神面貌的反映。
