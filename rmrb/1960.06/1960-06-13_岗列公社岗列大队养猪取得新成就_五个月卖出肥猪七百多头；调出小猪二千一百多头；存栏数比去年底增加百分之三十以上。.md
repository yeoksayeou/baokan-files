Ganglie Brigade of Ganglie Commune Achieves New Successes in Pig Raising

700+ Fat Pigs Sold in Five Months; 2,100+ Piglets Transferred; Stock Increased by Over 30% Compared to the End of Last Year

(Our Dispatch) The famous advanced pig-raising unit of Guangdong Province, the Ganglie Brigade of Ganglie Commune in Liangyang County, has achieved great success in pig production this year. By the end of May, a total of 486 sows in the brigade had given birth to piglets, with a survival rate of 96%. At the same time, in the past five months this year, the brigade, which has a total of 611 households, has sold 709 large fat pigs to the state, an average of more than one per household. In addition, 2,112 piglets have been transferred to support other communes and brigades. The current number of pigs in stock in the entire brigade is 6,046, an increase of more than 30% compared to the end of last year.

In order to develop pig raising at high speed, the Ganglie Brigade first focused on retaining sows, selecting breeds, and matching breeds, implementing the principle of "must retain sows, select after retaining." The brigade now has 1,194 sows, an increase of more than 50% compared to the end of last year. The sows in all six sow farms are divided into groups, pens, and troughs according to old gestation, young gestation, with cubs, etc., and are cared for by dedicated personnel. In the first two months of pregnancy, when the fetus grows slowly, the sows are mainly fed with green fodder; after two months of pregnancy, when the fetus develops faster, green fodder is reduced, and concentrated feed is increased; after 100 days of pregnancy, they are sent to the sow maternity hospital for careful management and feeding, appropriately reducing the amount of feed to prevent overeating and premature birth, and supplementing with some mineral feed and chlortetracycline to stimulate fetal development. As a result, no sows have had miscarriages this year.

In order to improve the conception rate and reproduction rate of sows, the brigade has comprehensively promoted artificial insemination, double mating, and repeated mating, and breeding is carried out as early as 20 to 30 days after delivery. At the same time, an annual breeding plan is set to ensure that 200 sows are bred each month. In terms of raising piglets to full vitality and strength, the following points are mainly focused on: ① Scientific delivery. ② Artificial fixation of teats. ③ Vigorously develop "piglet beds" and "supplementary feeding pens," always keep them clean, and change bedding frequently. ④ Piglets are trained to eat porridge, sweet potatoes, and cooked cow dung, etc., four or five days after birth, gradually increasing the number of meals and nutrition to enhance the vitality of the piglets.

After the brigade took the above measures, it effectively guaranteed the realization of the high-yield and full-survival plan, and promoted the high-speed development of the pig industry. In the entire brigade, from January to May alone, 486 sows gave birth to 4,434 piglets, an average of nearly ten per litter, with a survival rate of 96%.

The entire brigade has established a "Meat Pig Village," which implements group feeding according to the three different growth and development stages of meat pigs. Due to group feeding according to different stages, the meat pig fattening work has achieved remarkable results. From January to May this year, 709 large fat pigs were sold, with an average weight of 140 catties per pig, exceeding the plan to sell 611 large fat pigs. The meat consumption of the commune members has also greatly increased.

With the further development of the pig industry, the basic construction of the brigade's pig farms has also rapidly expanded. Now, in addition to owning a "Sow City" and a "Meat Pig Village" with a total construction area of 3,600 square meters, the remaining more than ten original pig farms have also been renovated. The total area of pig houses in the entire brigade reaches 16,000 square meters, more than doubling the area of pig houses in the first quarter of last year.

At the same time, the brigade has also vigorously carried out the reform of pig-raising tools.

Listening to the Party's words, establishing the idea of giving equal importance to grain and pigs, and establishing and improving a pig-raising team that is both red and expert is the primary key to ensuring the high-speed growth of live pigs. In recent years, the Party General Branch of this brigade has successively transferred a large number of Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and outstanding commune members to take charge of the leadership and feeding work on the pig-raising front, and established a pig-raising management committee headed by He Shikun, the Party General Branch Secretary. Since the beginning of this year, three Party members and four Youth League members have been transferred to take charge of the leadership of pig farms, convalescent homes for sick pigs, and pig farm team leaders.

    岗列公社岗列大队养猪取得新成就
    五个月卖出肥猪七百多头；调出小猪二千一百多头；存栏数比去年底增加百分之三十以上。
    本报讯　广东省著名的养猪先进单位——两阳县岗列公社岗列大队，今年的养猪生产又获得了巨大的成绩。到5月底止，全大队共有四百八十六头母猪产下小猪，成活率达96％。同时今年五个月来，这个共有六百一十一户的大队，卖给国家的大肥猪已达七百零九头，平均每户在一头以上，另外还调出小猪二千一百一十二头支援其他公社和大队。现在全队存栏的猪还有六千零四十六头，比去年底存栏数增加30％以上。
    为了高速度发展养猪，岗列大队首先抓住留母、选种、配种，执行了“见母必留，先留后选”的方针，现在全队母猪已发展到一千一百九十四头，比去年底增加了50％以上。全队六个母猪场的母猪，都按老胎、嫩胎、带仔等几种，分群分栏分槽和专人饲养。母猪在怀胎的头两个月，胎儿生长较慢，饲养以青饲料为主；怀胎两个月后，胎儿发育较快，减少青饲料，增加精饲料；怀胎一百天后，便送入母猪产院精管细养，适当减少喂量，防止过食早产，另补一些矿物质饲料和金霉素等，刺激胎儿发育。因而今年以来没有一头母猪流产。
    为了提高母猪受胎率和繁殖率，该队全面推行了人工授精、双重配种、重复配种，提早在产后二十至三十天内配上种。同时，还定出全年配种计划，保证每月有二百头母猪配上种。在仔猪的全活育壮方面，主要抓住如下几点：①科学接产。②人工固定奶头。③大搞“仔猪床”“补料栏”，经常保持清洁干净，经常换垫草。④仔猪产后四、五天便训练吃粥、吃番薯、吃煮熟的牛粪等，逐步增加餐数和营养，增强仔猪生活力。
    该队采取上述措施后，有效地保证了高产全活计划的实现，促进养猪业的高速度发展。仅1至5月全大队便有四百八十六头母猪产下四千四百三十四头仔猪，平均每胎近十头，成活率达96％。
    全队成立了一条“肉猪村”，按肉猪三个不同的生长发育阶段实行分群饲养。由于按不同阶段分群喂养，肉猪育肥工作成绩显著，今年1至5月即出售了大肥猪七百零九头，平均每头重量一百四十斤，超额完成了出售大肥猪六百一十一头的计划。社员的肉食也有很大增加。
    随着养猪业的进一步发展，该队猪场的基本建设也迅速地扩大起来。现在，除已拥有建筑面积共达三千六百平方米的一座“母猪城”和一座“肉猪村”外，其余原有的十多个猪场也均经过修建。全大队猪舍总面积达一万六千平方米，比去年第一季度猪舍面积扩大了一倍以上。
    与此同时，该队又大搞养猪工具改革。
    听党的话，树立粮猪并重思想，建立和健全一支又红又专的养猪业队伍，是保证生猪高速度增长的首要关键。这个队党总支最近几年来，连续抽调了大批的党团员、干部和优秀社员，担任养猪战线的领导工作和饲养工作，并以党总支书记何世坤为首成立了养猪管理委员会。今年以来，又抽调了三个党员和四个团员，分别担任猪场、病猪疗养院以及猪场小组长的领导工作。
