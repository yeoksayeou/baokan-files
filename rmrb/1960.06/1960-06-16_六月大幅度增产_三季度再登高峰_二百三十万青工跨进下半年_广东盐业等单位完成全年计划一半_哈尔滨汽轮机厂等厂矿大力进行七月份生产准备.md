Xinhua News Agency report from China Youth Daily: As of June 5th, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces (autonomous regions) and the two cities of Shanghai and Kunming, 2,355,096 young workers and 29,953 youth collectives have already completed half of their annual plans ahead of schedule, and 111,854 young workers and 1,400 youth collectives have stepped into 1961.

    In order to seize a substantial production increase in June and complete half of the annual plan, young workers in various regions are widely launching a competition where everyone strives to be "equal to several people." Due to the widespread development of the "equal to several people" competition, the development of technological revolution and the leap in production have been greatly promoted.

    The vast number of young workers and staff members regard the new experiences and technologies innovated and created in the technical revolution movement as the magic weapon for seizing a substantial production increase in June. They have formed organizations such as new technology promotion teams, insisting on using new experiences and technologies in production, improving them in application, and enhancing them in promotion. The Communist Youth League committees of many factories and mines in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Zhejiang, Xi'an, and Inner Mongolia have organized young people to conduct a large-scale debate on "how to treat new technologies," educating young people to unswervingly stand on the side of new things and become promoters of promoting new technologies and new experiences, greatly promoting production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province, which has the largest output of sea salt in southern China, has achieved a great harvest of sea salt in the first half of the year. By the end of May, the province had completed 51.42% of its annual salt production plan, an increase of 1.1 times compared to the same period last year. At present, a large amount of sea salt is being shipped out, and the supply to provinces such as Guangxi and Guizhou has increased compared to last year.

    Due to the influence of weather conditions, Guangdong's sea salt production has historically been lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half, with the first half of the year's output generally accounting for 44% of the annual output. This year, salt fields in various regions broke this "conventional pattern" and vigorously carried out work on brine production and crystallization management from the beginning, adding 18,000 brine tanks, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution to increase seawater concentration and preserve brine. More than 40,000 salt industry workers seized favorable weather conditions, rushed to harvest and dry, and vigorously increased production.

    Now, on the basis of completing the first half of the year's plan ahead of schedule, salt field workers in various regions are advancing victoriously. Under the current situation of more rainy and cloudy days, the vast number of workers are seizing short sunny days, racing against time, and striving to produce more salt for the country in the first half of the year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Nanjing Phoenix Mountain Iron Mine has completed half of the annual state plan twenty-six days ahead of schedule. As of June 4th, a total of 600,400 tons of ore have been produced, accounting for more than 50% of the annual plan, an increase of 51% compared to the same period last year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 15th: The Harbin Steam Turbine Plant insists on using the method of grasping both ends, grasping the realization of a substantial production increase in June on one hand, and grasping the production preparation work for the third quarter on the other hand, so that production and preparation work have achieved a comprehensive harvest. On June 10th, the factory had completed 42.7% of its June plan.

    In order to promote the continuous development of the production upsurge, the factory's Party committee, while firmly grasping the high-yield month of substantial production increase in June, closely grasped the production preparation work for the third quarter. The Party committee secretary went deep into the steel casting workshop and studied new processes with the workers, greatly improving the casting quality and preparing the castings needed for the third quarter ahead of schedule. Now, the technical, material, and process preparations for ensuring the continuous leap in production in the third quarter have been basically completed throughout the factory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, June 15th: The Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong is actively strengthening production preparation work while firmly grasping current production, to ensure the realization of a continuous leap in the third quarter.

    In order to further strengthen production preparation, the bureau recently convened a meeting of chief engineers and other personnel from various mines to analyze new problems in production, formulate plans, and decide to increase the recoverable period to more than four months by the end of June, laying a good foundation for the continued rise in raw coal production in the third quarter.

    In order to ensure a large-scale high yield, the bureau has also determined to vigorously reform weak links such as transportation, hoisting, and ventilation. In addition, they will further promote advanced experiences such as deep-hole blasting, electric drilling, and "four-six intersection" operations, and launch a competition for large-scale tunneling in the entire mining area.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 15th: The workers of the Tianjin Coal Mine Special Equipment Factory are in high spirits and full of vigor, and have completed half of this year's annual plan in five months. They have now begun trial production of new products planned for the third quarter.

    In order to meet the needs of various coal mines, the factory plans to actively expand production in the third quarter, while also producing a batch of new products, and carrying out product revolutions for old products such as mine lamps that were previously produced with excessive materials and were bulky.

    六月大幅度增产  三季度再登高峰
    二百三十万青工跨进下半年　广东盐业等单位完成全年计划一半
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂等厂矿大力进行七月份生产准备
    据中国青年报报道　到6月5日止，据二十一个省（自治区）和上海、昆明两个市的不完全统计，已有二百三十五万五千零九十六名青年工人和二万九千九百五十三个青年集体提前完成了全年计划的一半，并且有十一万一千八百五十四名青年工人和一千四百个青年集体跨进了1961年。
    为了夺取6月份大幅度增产和完成全年计划的一半，各地青年工人中正在广泛开展一个人人力争“一顶几”的竞赛。由于“一顶几”竞赛的广泛开展，大大促进了技术革命的发展和生产跃进。
    广大青年职工都把技术革命运动中革新创造的新经验、新技术当作夺取6月份大幅度增产的法宝。他们纷纷组成新技术推广队等组织，坚持把新经验、新技术使用到生产中去，在运用中完善，在推广中提高。北京、上海、太原、沈阳、浙江、西安和内蒙古等地许多厂矿的共青团委员会，组织青年们开展了“怎样对待新技术”的大辩论，教育青年们要坚定不移地站到新生事物一边，当推广新技术、新经验的促进派，大大推动了生产。
    据新华社广州电　我国南方海盐产量最多的广东省，上半年获得海盐大丰收。到5月底止，全省已经完成了全年产盐计划的51．42％，比去年同期增长一点一一倍。现在，大批海盐正源源外运，对广西、贵州等省区的供应量都比去年增加。
    广东海盐生产由于气象条件影响，历年都是上半年少下半年多，上半年的产量一般占全年产量的44％。今年，各地盐场打破这一“常规”，一开始就大力进行制卤和结晶管理的工作，并增加卤缸一万八千个，大力开展技术革新和技术革命，以提高海水浓度和保卤。四万多名盐业职工抓紧有利天气，抢收抢晒，大力增产。
    现在，各地盐场职工正在提前完成上半年计划的基础上，乘胜前进。广大职工在当前雨天、阴天较多的情况下，抢短晴天，分秒必争，力争上半年为国家增产更多的盐。
    新华社南京电　南京凤凰山铁矿已经提前二十六天完成全年国家计划的一半。到6月4日止，共生产矿石六十万零四百吨，为年度计划的50％以上，比去年同期产量增长51％。
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨汽轮机厂坚持运用两手抓的方法，一手抓6月份实现大幅度增产，一手抓第三季度生产准备工作，使生产、准备工作全面获得丰收。6月10日，这个厂已经完成了6月份计划的42．7％。
    工厂党委为了推动生产高潮不断向前发展，在狠抓6月份大幅度高产月的同时，紧紧抓住第三季度生产准备工作。党委书记深入铸钢车间，同工人一起研究采取了新工艺，大大提高了铸造质量，提前准备了第三季度需要的铸件。现在，全厂保证三季度生产持续跃进的技术、材料和工艺等准备工作，都已基本就绪了。
    据新华社淄博15日电　山东淄博矿务局在狠抓当前生产的同时积极加强生产准备工作，以确保实现第三季度持续跃进。
    为了进一步加强生产准备，这个局最近又召开了各矿总工程师等人员的会议，分析生产中的新问题，制定规划，决定到6月底使可采期达到四个多月，为第三季度的原煤产量持续上升打下良好的基础。
    为保证夺得大面积高产，这个局还确定对运输、提升、通风等薄弱环节进行大力改革。此外他们还将进一步推广深孔爆破、电钻打眼、“四六交叉”作业等先进经验，在全矿区掀起一个大搞掘进的竞赛。
    据新华社天津15日电　天津市煤矿专用设备厂的职工意气风发、干劲昂扬，已用五个月的时间完成了今年全年计划的一半，目前已开始试制计划在第三季度生产的新产品。
    为适应各煤矿的需要，这个厂计划在第三季度积极扩大生产，同时生产一批新产品，并且对过去生产的用料多而笨重的矿灯等老产品进行产品革命。
