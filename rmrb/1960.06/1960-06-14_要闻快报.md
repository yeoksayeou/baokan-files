News in Brief

The Hanjiang Main Levee in the Chao-Shan Plain Overcomes a Major Flood Peak
The Hanjiang main levee in the Chao-Shan Plain, Guangdong Province, has safely withstood the attack of an extremely large flood peak brought about by typhoon rainstorms, thanks to the tenacious defense of the flood-fighting army. Currently, the Hanjiang River's water level is still above the danger level. The vast number of cadres and masses are still tirelessly persevering in their battle on the levee.

In the past few days, the tense flood prevention and rescue struggle in the Shantou area has received great concern and support from the Provincial Party Committee. Chen Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, Yin Linping, Alternate Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and responsible comrades of the Air Force stationed in Guangzhou under the People's Liberation Army, arrived over the flood-fighting front line of Shantou Prefecture by plane on the afternoon of the 11th to inspect the condition of the Hanjiang levee. The Air Force and civil aviation departments are continuing to airlift large quantities of emergency rescue materials to further strengthen support for the flood-fighting struggle in Shantou Prefecture.

Fujian Areas Affected by Typhoons Vigorously Restore Production
Areas in Fujian Province that were affected by typhoons, rainstorms, and floods are vigorously restoring production. In the fields where the wind and rain have just stopped, vehicles and boats shuttle back and forth everywhere, and people's voices are loud. People are busy draining water, supporting seedlings, washing seedlings, replanting and applying additional fertilizer, and rushing to repair water conservancy projects such as embankments and dams that were destroyed by typhoons, rainstorms, and high tides, and resettling disaster-stricken residents of flooded villages.

Parts of the seawall in the suburbs of Xiamen City that were damaged by typhoons, rainstorms, and high tides have been basically repaired in just over a day, thanks to the concentrated efforts of various communes to rush repairs. In Lianjiang, Anxi, and other counties, the vast number of commune members are opening ditches, draining water, supporting seedlings, washing seedlings, and processing and applying additional fertilizer in the more than 100,000 mu of farmland that has been flooded.

Guizhou Combines Summer Harvest with Careful Seed Selection
Guizhou Province, which has achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops, has carefully carried out seed selection work, and the various improved varieties selected have sufficient quantity and high quality. In order to meet the needs of expanding the autumn planting area this year, various places have selected a considerable number of backup seeds. As early as the vigorous growth period of summer crops, production teams in Bijie Prefecture organized old farmers, technical cadres, and commune member appraisal teams to go deep into the fields to compare and appraise each plot and select seed bases. As soon as the summer harvest began, various places adopted the method of combining professional teams with commune members' shock efforts to select improved varieties.

Because the selected improved varieties are threshed and dried separately, and managed in separate warehouses by special personnel according to variety, the various improved varieties selected in Zhenning, Anlong, Puding, and other counties have been tested and their purity and cleanliness have reached over 95%.

Shanghai Suburbs Select Summer-Ripened Crop Seeds
The people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai are vigorously engaged in the selection and retention of seeds for summer-ripened crops, and are establishing seed bases for autumn-ripened crops such as early rice and late rice.

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the county party committees of the suburban counties, and the party committees of various communes attach particular importance to the selection and retention of seeds for summer-ripened crops this year, believing that this is a powerful guarantee for earnestly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" and promoting the high-speed and sustained leap forward in agricultural production. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee specifically convened a city-wide seed work conference and a seed selection on-site meeting, organized representatives from various counties and communes to visit and learn, exchange seed selection experience, and promote the comprehensive development of seed selection work.

This year, the summer seed selection work in the suburbs of Shanghai is a grand affair, and each county and commune has organized professional seed selection teams.

Hou Zhengyuan Successfully Reforms Suspended Cultivator
Hou Zhengyuan, a pace-setter and Communist Party member of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, has recently successfully reformed a suspended cultivator. This cultivator is easy to manufacture, is operated by one person, can be raised and lowered at any time, speeds up turning at the end of the field, and increases work efficiency by more than twice compared to a towed cultivator. It can also avoid the phenomenon of the cultivator injuring seedlings and burying seedlings when turning. Relevant departments of the Corps have begun to promote this cultivator to various farms.

Hou Zhengyuan is a first-class labor model of the Production and Construction Corps and attended the National Heroes Conference last year. Since the beginning of 1956, he has been driving a Motz tractor and has continuously reformed machinery and innovated cultivation techniques, creating a new record of safe cultivation for more than 17,000 hours without major repairs in the past four years.

    几天来，汕头地区紧张的防洪抢险斗争，得到了省委的极大关怀和支持。中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省省长陈郁、省委书记处候补书记尹林平和人民解放军空军驻广州部队负责同志，11日下午又乘飞机到达汕头专区抗洪前线上空，视察韩江堤防情况。空军和民航部门仍在继续大量空运抢险器材，进一步加强对汕头专区抗洪斗争的支援。
    福建受台风地区大力恢复生产
    福建省遭受台风、暴雨和洪水侵袭的地区，正大力恢复生产。在风雨初停的田野上，到处车船穿梭往来，人声喧腾，人们忙着排渍、扶苗、洗苗和补种加肥，并突击修复被台风暴雨和大潮冲毁的堤防、水坝等水利工程，安置被淹村庄的受灾居民。
    厦门市郊遭受台风暴雨和大潮冲坏的部分海堤，经过各公社集中力量突击抢修，只一天多，就基本修复。连江、安溪等县广大社员在受淹的十多万亩农田中，开沟排水、扶苗、洗苗和加工加肥。

    侯正元改革成功悬挂式中耕器
    新疆生产建设兵团标兵、共产党员侯正元，最近改革成功一种悬挂式中耕器。这种中耕器制作简便，由一个人掌握，能随时升降，加快了地头转弯速度，工效比牵引式中耕器提高一倍以上，而且可以避免中耕器在转弯时伤苗埋苗现象。兵团有关部门已开始向各农场推广这种中耕器。
    侯正元是生产建设兵团一级劳动模范，去年出席了全国群英会。从1956年初，他就开始驾驶一台莫特兹拖拉机，而且不断地改革机具和革新耕作技术，创造了四年来安全耕作一万七千多小时无大修的新纪录。
