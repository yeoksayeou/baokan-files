    The Glorious Duty of Children's Workers
    Song Qingling

    Communism is humanity's greatest and most beautiful ideal. To make this ideal a reality in our country as quickly as possible, the entire working people of our country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, are using their diligent hands and boundless wisdom to unleash a high tide of technical revolution, cultural revolution, and production construction on the fronts of production, science, and culture, building socialism at high speed, and laying the foundation for the edifice of communism. Today's children are the future builders of communism; they will inherit us and complete the great cause of communist construction. This is an extremely great and unprecedented undertaking, one that can only be shouldered not by ordinary people, but by people who far surpass our generation in all aspects. They must be new people with a high degree of communist ideological consciousness and noble communist moral character, and with all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education. To cultivate such communist successors for the motherland is the glorious duty of contemporary children's workers.

    Engels long ago said: "With the transformation of the means of production into social property, the individual family will no longer be the economic unit of society. Private housework will be transformed into a social industry. The care and education of children will become a public matter; society will equally care for all children." In our country, with the great victories of socialist transformation and socialist construction, especially with the Great Leap Forward and the large-scale establishment of people's communes in urban and rural areas, collective welfare undertakings have also been greatly developed, housework has gradually become socialized, and the education of children is gradually being undertaken by society. Nurseries and kindergartens, institutions that Lenin called the young buds of communism, have sprung up like mushrooms all over the country and are growing vigorously. Today, our country's child care and education has developed into an undertaking of the whole people and the whole society. Tens of millions of children are receiving good care and education in nurseries and kindergartens. They are healthy, their knowledge is constantly increasing, and their excellent qualities of unity and mutual assistance, love for the collective, love for labor, and perseverance and courage are being cultivated. Ninety million children are receiving an all-round education in moral, intellectual, and physical education in elementary schools. They study hard and strive to improve every day, and socialist and communist ideas are taking root among them. Various after-school educational institutions run by the state also fully develop children's intelligence and make them healthier. Under the collective education of society, our children are growing into excellent communist successors. Such tremendous achievements could never be accomplished by scattered family education. This shows that social collective education has incomparable advantages over family education, and the policy of making social education the main focus of children's education is becoming increasingly popular.

    With the rapid development of child care and education, and the implementation of the policy of making social education the main focus of children's education, the ranks of children's workers have also grown accordingly. The ranks of childcare and education personnel alone have reached six million. They work diligently for children day and night, love children, greatly develop communist maternal love, nurture children with communist ideas, educate children with scientific methods, and comprehensively care for children's growth. The number of elementary school teachers and various children's workers has also greatly increased. Countless teachers are cultivating children like gardeners cultivating flowers, educating children with their exemplary behavior, teaching both books and people, and are now actively experimenting with teaching reforms. Literary and art workers have written many educational children's books for children, and produced many children's films and dramas with strong ideological and artistic qualities. Medical workers are working hard to protect children's health and eliminate diseases that harm children, diligently studying and bravely creating. All of this shows that a contingent of children's workers with communist ideological consciousness and a high level of professional competence, both red and expert, is taking shape. On the eve of this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the National Committee for the Defence of Children of China jointly rewarded ten thousand "Advanced Children's Work Collectives" and "Advanced Children's Workers." These are outstanding representatives of countless advanced children's work collectives and advanced children's workers, reflecting the new face of our country's children's work and children's workers, which is something we should greatly celebrate.

    With the continuous Great Leap Forward in our country's industrial and agricultural production and the participation of the broad masses of women in social labor, preschool children's care and education must be actively developed and consolidated and improved in the process of development. Teaching reforms in primary and secondary schools must be actively carried out, and the responsibility of children's workers will become even greater. The Party and the state have entrusted you with the important task of shaping people. You are the engineers who cultivate communist successors. This work is even more important than driving a tractor or pressing a button. Educators must first be educated. In order to cultivate the new generation into laborers with communist ideas and mastery of cultural and scientific knowledge, children's workers must establish the viewpoint of serving children wholeheartedly and be determined to regard child care and education as their lifelong career. First, they must earnestly and persistently study Marxism-Leninism and study Chairman Mao's works, use the spirit of continuous revolution to transform their own thinking, and constantly improve their communist consciousness. Criticize and eliminate bourgeois ideas in children's education and educate children with communist ideas. Subtly influence children with their own exemplary behavior. Children's workers must also persistently study their profession and constantly improve their cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge and professional level. Only in this way can they impart the scientific and cultural knowledge accumulated by mankind to children, who will then further develop and improve it when they grow up, becoming true masters of culture, science, and technology, and constantly pushing society forward.

    Our country's children's workers are responsible for shaping hundreds of millions of children, which is a work that the whole Party and the whole people care about. Today, the lives of our country's children are happy, and the motherland has created good conditions for their all-round development. Children's workers should make full use of these conditions to cultivate hundreds of millions of children in our country into excellent communist successors. Your duties are undoubtedly very important, glorious, and noble.

    儿童工作者的光荣职责
    宋庆龄
    共产主义是人类最伟大、最美好的理想。为了使这个理想尽快地在我国成为现实，我国全体劳动人民在党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，正在用自己勤劳的双手、无穷的智慧，在生产、科学和文化战线上，掀起技术革命、文化革命和生产建设的高潮，高速度地建设社会主义，为共产主义大厦打基础。今天的儿童是未来的共产主义建设者，他们将继承我们，完成共产主义建设伟业。这是极其伟大的史无前例的事业，不是一般的人，而是在各方面都远远超过我们这一代的人，才能够担负起来。他们必须是具有高度的共产主义思想觉悟和高尚的共产主义道德品质的人，是德育、智育、体育全面发展的新人。为祖国培养这样的共产主义接班人，是当代儿童工作者的光荣职责。
    恩格斯早已说过：“随着生产资料转化为社会公有，个体家庭也不会再是社会的经济单位。私人的家务将变为社会的工业。孩子的照管和教养将成为公众的事情；社会将同等地关怀一切儿童。”在我国随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，特别是在大跃进和城乡大办人民公社的同时，也大办集体福利事业，家务劳动逐渐实现社会化，儿童教养逐步地由社会担负起来。托儿所、幼儿园，这些曾被列宁称为共产主义的幼芽的机构，如雨后春笋般地在全国各地普遍大量地出现，并正在茁壮地成长起来。现在，我国的儿童保育和教育事业已经发展成为全民、全社会的事业。几千万儿童在托儿所和幼儿园里受到良好的教养。他们的身体健康，知识不断增长，团结互助、热爱集体、热爱劳动、坚毅勇敢等优良品德正在养成。九千万儿童在小学校里受到德育、智育、体育全面发展的教育。他们努力学习，天天向上，社会主义、共产主义思想正在他们中间生根。国家所举办的各种校外教育机构，也使儿童的智慧得到充分的发展，身体更为健康。在社会的集体教养之下，我国儿童正在成长为优秀的共产主义接班人，这样巨大的成绩，绝非一家一户分散教养所能办到的，这就显示了社会的集体教养比家庭教养具有无比的优越性，而使儿童教育以社会教育为主的方针日益深入人心。
    随着儿童保育和教育事业的飞跃发展，和儿童教育以社会教育为主的方针的贯彻执行，儿童工作者的队伍也相应地壮大起来。单保教人员的队伍已有六百万人。他们日日夜夜地为儿童辛勤劳动着，热爱孩子，大大发扬了共产主义的母爱，他们用共产主义的思想培育儿童，用科学的方法教养儿童，他们全面关怀儿童的成长。小学教师和各种儿童工作者也大大增加。无数教师像园丁培养花朵一样培养着儿童，以自己的模范行为教育儿童，做到了教书又教人，现在又正在积极地试行教学改革。文艺工作者为儿童编写了许多有教育意义的儿童读物，演出了许多思想性艺术性较强的儿童电影、戏剧。医务工作者为保护儿童健康，消灭危害儿童的疾病而刻苦钻研、勇敢创造。所有这一切都表明，一支具有共产主义思想觉悟和高度业务水平、又红又专的儿童工作者的队伍正在形成。今年“六一”国际儿童节前夕，全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇联和中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会四个团体联名奖励的万名“先进儿童工作集体”和“先进儿童工作者”，就是无数先进儿童工作集体和先进儿童工作者的优秀代表，从他们身上，反映出了我国儿童工作和儿童工作者的新面貌，这是值得我们大大庆贺的事。
    随着我国工农业生产持续大跃进和广大妇女参加社会劳动，学龄前儿童保育和教育工作还要积极发展并在发展中巩固、提高，中小学教学改革要积极进行试验，儿童工作者的责任也就更加重大了。党和国家把塑造人的重任交给你们，你们是培育共产主义接班人的工程师，这项工作比开拖拉机，比按电钮还重要。教育者必先受教育。为了培养新的一代成为具有共产主义思想、掌握文化和科学知识的劳动者，儿童工作者必须树立全心全意为儿童的观点，下定决心把儿童保教工作当做自己的终身事业。首先要认真地顽强地学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作，用不断革命的精神改造自己的思想，不断提高共产主义觉悟。批判和清除儿童教育工作中的资产阶级思想，用共产主义思想教育儿童。用自己的模范行为潜移默化地影响儿童。儿童工作者还必须顽强地钻研业务，不断地提高自己的文化、科学、技术知识和业务水平。这样才能把人类积累下来的科学文化知识传授给儿童，他们长大后再加以更大的发展和提高，成为真正的文化、科学、技术的主宰，把社会不断向前推进。
    我国儿童工作者担负着塑造数以亿计的儿童的工作，这是全党全民都关心的工作。今天我国儿童的生活是幸福的，祖国给他们创造了全面发展的良好条件，儿童工作者应充分运用这些条件，把我国亿万儿童培育成为共产主义优秀的接班人。你们的职责无疑是十分重要、光荣和高尚的。
