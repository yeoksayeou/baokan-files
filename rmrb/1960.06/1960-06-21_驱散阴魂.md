    Expelling the Vile Spirits
    Dong Feng
    Though Dulles has met his demise, his vile spirit lingers.
    The American bandit Eisenhower, carrying conspiracy and plague, also brought the vile spirit of Dulles to Taiwan. He is determined to be the enemy of the Chinese people, vainly attempting to continue occupying our territory of Taiwan. This dream has driven him to utter insane nonsense. In recent days, Eisenhower has been engaging in many secretive conspiracies in Taiwan. In a speech, he said: "To reiterate Secretary of State Dulles' words of 1957, our firm belief is that the strict, monolithic rule of international communism is a temporary rather than a permanent phenomenon, in China and elsewhere."
    These words sound like the mumbling of Dulles from the underworld. The great victories of the international communist movement, the great victories of the anti-American struggle of the people of the world, have frightened Eisenhower to the point of losing his mind. Closing his eyes and uttering a few nonsensical words is merely taking a sedative for himself and bolstering the courage of his running dogs. However, facts are facts, and resolutely being the enemy of the people of the world will never end well.
    History has repeatedly proven this point: the existence of imperialism is truly a "temporary rather than a permanent phenomenon." The more evil deeds American imperialism commits, the shorter its lifespan will be. Aggressors who stubbornly cling to the bandits' "firm belief" are bound to be sentenced to the gallows by the people of the world one day. Eventually, the people of the world will not only cast imperialism into hell, but also dispel the vile spirit of imperialism from the world.

    驱散阴魂
    东锋
    杜勒斯虽然呜呼哀哉了，可是他的阴魂不散。
    美国强盗艾森豪威尔带着阴谋和疾疫，也带着杜勒斯的阴魂到台湾去了。他坚决同中国人民为敌，妄想继续霸占我国领土台湾。这梦想，简直使他发疯一样的说起糊话来了。最近几天，艾森豪威尔在台湾鬼鬼祟祟地进行了许多阴谋活动，他在一次讲话中说：“重申一下杜勒斯国务卿1957年所说的我们的坚定信念，即：国际共产主义的严格清一色的统治在中国和在其他地方一样，是一种一时的而不是永久的现象。”
    这些话，真像是杜勒斯在阴曹地府的喃喃呓语。国际共产主义运动的巨大胜利，全世界人民反美斗争的巨大胜利，简直使得艾森豪威尔胆战心惊，神智不清了。闭起眼睛来说几句糊话，不过是给自己吃颗定神丸，为走狗们壮壮胆量而已。然而，事实总归是事实，坚决同全世界人民为敌，总是没有好下场的。
    历史一再证明了这一点：帝国主义的存在，才真正是“一时的而不是永久的现象”；美帝国主义越是做坏事，它的寿命就更加不会长久了，对于死抱住强盗的“坚定信念”不放的侵略者，势必有一天要被世界人民处以绞刑。终归有一天，世界人民不仅要把帝国主义打入地狱，而且要在人间驱散帝国主义的阴魂。
