Comrades, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, I extend warm congratulations to this conference and to all the representatives for the great achievements you have made in your work.

I fully endorse Comrade Lu Dingyi's instructions to the conference on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, Comrade Lin Feng's report, and the reports of other leading comrades. These instructions have pointed out a clearer direction for our efforts and goals, and have given us unlimited strength. This conference is a gathering where everyone reports achievements to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, exchanges advanced experiences, learns from each other, and vows to push our cultural revolution to a new high. I firmly believe that through this conference, everyone will move further in the direction pointed out by the Party, further play the role of backbone, leading role, and bridge, closely unite the broad masses, and strive forward, and will inevitably create more outstanding achievements and better serve socialist construction.

Since the founding of the country, under the care and leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, China's health work has achieved leaping development and made tremendous achievements. The development process of health work over the past eleven years, as Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out, is a process of the proletariat's struggle with the bourgeoisie for leadership, a sharp struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. We held high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smashed the absurd arguments made by bourgeois rightists such as "health work is a special scientific and technological work," "politics cannot lead professional work," and "laymen cannot lead experts," completely defeated the bourgeois rightists' attempts to usurp the Party's leadership over health work, and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. In 1959, we won a victory against right-leaning opportunist elements within the Party, consolidating the Party's leadership over health work. In the struggle between the two roads, we continuously criticized all kinds of bourgeois ideas in the health ranks, and raised the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of health personnel. The idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and the communist style have grown rapidly. With the increasing consolidation and strengthening of the Party's leadership over health work, and the in-depth development of ideological transformation, a magnificent situation of vigorous development has emerged in the health field. Now we have basically built a health and medical care network covering urban and rural areas, and a medical and health science and technology team that is both red and expert is growing rapidly. The Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine has been comprehensively and deeply implemented, the ideas of belittling, discriminating against, and excluding traditional Chinese medicine have been fundamentally reversed, and the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have been increasingly strengthened. New achievements have been made in preventing and treating diseases, sorting out and studying the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, and developing medical science, providing extremely favorable conditions for creating China's new school of medicine. The production of medicines and equipment has also been greatly developed, providing a material guarantee for the high-speed implementation of eliminating pests and diseases.

The mass health movement centered on eliminating the "four pests," emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases is the fundamental task of China's health work and a significant symbol of people's health work. In recent years, starting from the development of production, closely cooperating with production, and serving production, the mass health movement has been developing wave after wave. Especially in the past few months, various regions have implemented the Party Central Committee's instructions on health work, and Party committees at all levels have further strengthened the leadership of health work. The first secretaries have personally taken charge, closely combined with production, combined with organizing the people's collective life and the technical revolution and cultural revolution, making great fanfare, creating momentum, and carrying out publicity, and have launched a new upsurge of a wide-ranging, in-depth, unprecedented, and large-scale mass health movement. The broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in urban and rural areas, regardless of gender or age, have all taken action, eliminating the "four pests" on a large scale, emphasizing hygiene, and combining with production and basic construction to carry out environmental sanitation, actively improving sanitary facilities, and strengthening the fundamental work of eliminating pests and diseases. A large number of breeding grounds for the "four pests" have been cleared, the "four pests" have been greatly reduced, and the urban and rural sanitary conditions have been further improved. More and more cities and rural areas are showing a new atmosphere of tidiness, cleanliness, and a pleasant environment.

The widespread and in-depth mass health movement has powerfully changed the mental outlook of the Chinese people, further enhanced people's collectivist thinking, broken the unhygienic and superstitious ideas left over from the old society, and a new social trend of taking hygiene as an honor and unhygienic behavior as a shame is gradually forming. Not spitting everywhere, not littering fruit peels, debris, and cigarette butts, washing hands before meals and after using the toilet, eliminating pests when they are seen, and dissuading unhygienic behavior have gradually become people's conscious actions and daily habits.

In the mass health movement, large-scale mass prevention and treatment work has been actively carried out for various diseases, implementing the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, and comprehensive measures, so that the cure rate of diseases has been significantly improved and the incidence rate has been greatly reduced. Cholera, the most serious threat to people's health, has never occurred since liberation; smallpox, plague, and kala-azar have also been basically eliminated. Schistosomiasis, which endangers people's health and is prevalent in twelve provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the south, has been treated in more than 5,290,000 patients; at the same time, a large number of patients with malaria, hookworm disease, and filariasis have also been treated, and these diseases have been basically eliminated in many areas. Many epidemic areas, which were once sparsely populated and the fields were barren, now show a prosperous scene of "increased production in fields, increased life expectancy for people, and flourishing livestock." The incidence and mortality rates of other various acute and chronic infectious diseases and endemic diseases have also been greatly reduced. Previously considered incurable severe Keshan disease and Kaschin-Beck disease have also found better treatment methods. Since this spring, more disease-free areas and units have emerged, more powerfully supporting and promoting the development of production.

The mass health movement is closely combined with the magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which significantly improves the efficiency of eliminating the "four pests," emphasizing hygiene, eliminating diseases, and the quality of health work. Various regions have innovated and created a large number of tools and equipment for eliminating the "four pests" and emphasizing hygiene, such as the mechanization and semi-mechanization of sweeping and manure removal. Many food processing and cooking utensils have achieved automation or semi-automation, which not only reduces physical labor and improves work efficiency, but also reduces the chance of food being contaminated during operation. The achievements made in industrial hygiene are even greater. As a result of technical innovation, it has not only enhanced safe production, but also improved occupational hygiene. Many industries have fundamentally solved the problems of dust, toxic substance poisoning, and heatstroke; it has provided extremely favorable conditions for completely eliminating various occupational diseases and common diseases. In the medical departments, the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine has realized tens of thousands of innovation projects, innovating and creating many technical equipment and diagnostic and treatment methods, which has greatly improved work efficiency and medical quality, shortened treatment time, reduced patient suffering, and many difficult and critical illnesses have been effectively treated and rescued. In the production departments of medicines, equipment, and biological products, many have realized automation and semi-automation, which not only reduces physical labor, but also improves production and quality.

In the booming mass movement, China's health cause has made tremendous achievements.

In the booming and vigorous mass health movement, many advanced health areas, advanced units, and a large number of advanced workers have emerged. Under the leadership of the Party, they have resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of "changing customs and transforming the world." For example, the well-known Jishan County in Shanxi Province, Foshan City in Guangdong Province, Chongqing City in Sichuan Province, and Wulaocun Village in Nanjing City are all nationally renowned advanced health areas. Now, these model counties, cities, and villages are striding towards higher standards. After eliminating schistosomiasis, Yujiang County in Jiangxi successively eliminated hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria, and trachoma. Many advanced health counties, cities, and advanced areas have also emerged in other provinces and cities. There are even more advanced units and advanced individuals that have emerged in the health movement and various health works. Today, those present are representatives of these advanced units and advanced individuals, such as the First People's Hospital of Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, which adheres to putting politics in command, vigorously carries out mass movements, vigorously promotes technical revolution, excellently completes arduous medical tasks, vigorously carries out prevention work, and has created and innovated more than 10,000 items in more than a year, and has manufactured high-precision medical instruments such as multi-purpose electronic diagnostic and treatment machines; after rescuing steel worker Qiu Caikang, Guangci Hospital in Shanghai has made new achievements in the treatment of burns; the surgical teaching and research group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College rescued stevedore Cheng Debao, setting a shining example for trying every possible means to rescue patients; Yuncheng County Hospital in Shanxi Province conscientiously implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and actively carried out prevention work, which has achieved great results; the Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute and the Fuwai Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have achieved remarkable results in the prevention and treatment of hypertension by combining traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine; the Keshan Disease Research Group of Xi'an Medical College has carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and has made significant progress in conquering the fortress of Keshan disease; the 169 Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region has not had any medical accidents or medical errors in the past two years, and has actively carried out local medical and prevention work; Wuhu City Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute has vigorously launched mass movements and carried out rapid treatment in the prevention and treatment of trachoma, which has achieved great results; Shanghai First Medical College, Beijing Medical College, Xi'an Medical College, etc., teachers and students combined, vigorously launched mass movements, and carried out various reforms in teaching content, teaching methods, etc., and a new atmosphere has emerged; Jiangyin Health School in Jiangsu Province conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy, carried forward the revolutionary and pioneering spirit, started from scratch, and has established a comprehensive health school with eight classes in the past two years; Linqing County Health School in Shandong Province, teachers and students went deep into the countryside, combined with the health movement, carried out medical and health work, helped the grassroots to train cadres, establish organizations, and adopted the method of learning, applying, speaking, and doing, which greatly improved the quality of teaching; Daye People's Commune in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, formed a whole with the maternity hospital, nursery, and kindergarten, creating good experience for carrying out comprehensive maternal and child health work.

Among the advanced figures, there are Liu Jintao, a female medical worker from Hunan Province who is a skilled innovator in creating high-efficiency treatment for schistosomiasis and hookworm disease; there are Wu Yingjin, Lan Futai, and Li Rong, who have mastered the living habits of mice and are familiar with the habits of mice; there is Shen Jinbao, an expert in eliminating snails; there is Yuan Jinduo, a mosquito eradication hero; there is He Feng'e, a midwife who selflessly rescued a dystocia woman; there are Aibaidoula and Wu Dianhua, who used their own skin and fresh blood to save critically ill patients; there is Du Guiqin, a nurse from Yichun City who works hard and overcomes difficulties to serve the health of forest workers; there is Ren Jiran, an old traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Yangzhou who wholeheartedly serves patients and enthusiastically and patiently imparts technology; there is Jin Wenqi, a professor at Wuhan Medical College who has seriously studied and researched traditional Chinese medicine and has achieved great results; there is Guo Tongzhen, a surgeon from Jinzhong District Hospital who diligently studies and creates a variety of medical devices; there is Wang Guixiang, a nursery worker at Diaoyu'er Hutong Nursery in Beijing, who tries every possible means to serve children; there is Dou Geji, a Tibetan assistant nurse who works diligently and conscientiously and selflessly for eight years; there is Jin Zhong, a Mongolian maternal and child health worker who works hard and overcomes various difficulties, enduring all kinds of pain, and often wading through the desert for the prosperity of the Mongolian population and the health of mothers and infants; there is Li Hongquan, an air force health worker who is not afraid of hardship, enthusiastically serves the people, and is praised as a "miracle doctor" by the local people; there is Wang Jingzheng from Chongqing First Workers' Hospital who insists on putting politics in command, studying Chairman Mao's writings, vigorously engaging in technical innovation, and improving the quality of medical care; there is Zhao Risheng, a sanitation worker from Zhanjiang City who has worked actively for ten years as if it were a single day; and there is Wang Zirong, the "living Xiang Xiuli," who was specially invited to the meeting, and so on. In short, there are countless advanced areas, advanced units, and advanced figures in health work. These advanced model units and figures are all role models for health and medical personnel to learn from, and they are all red flags, backbones, and vanguards in the health movement.

Comrades, the tremendous achievements of China's health cause and the outstanding achievements made by everyone in their respective positions are the victory of the Party's leadership, the victory of the Party's general line for building socialism and various health work guidelines and policies, the victory of vigorously carrying out mass movements, and the victory of our continuous ideological revolution, and ultimately, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Glory should belong to our glorious, great, and correct Party, to our great leader Chairman Mao of all ethnic groups, to the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups in the country, and to all the comrades working on the health front.

Our health cause is a tool to protect people's health and improve people's health level, and it shoulders the glorious task of changing customs and transforming the world. The tremendous achievements we have made are still far from this requirement and are only a beginning. We must strive forward, closely keep up with the great situation of the continuous leap forward in China's socialist construction, closely cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, cooperate with the people's commune movement in rural and urban areas, cooperate with the cultural and technical revolution, continue to deepen the nationwide patriotic health movement of eliminating the "four pests," emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, strive to achieve the task of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, completely change China's sanitary conditions, and greatly improve the health knowledge and health level of the Chinese people. To this end, we must further do the following tasks well.

Continue to vigorously carry out mass health movements, change customs, and transform the world

The patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the "four pests," emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases is a great undertaking to overcome diseases, conquer nature, and change customs, and it is an important part of our entire cause of transforming the world, and also an important task of carrying out the cultural revolution. We must resolutely and conscientiously implement the Party's health work policy, so that the great patriotic health movement is more closely combined with production and the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and develops more widely and deeply to a higher stage, further popularizing the experience of "Jishan" and "Foshan" health work, creating more advanced health units and areas, and we must make remarkable achievements in these three years of 1960, 1961, and 1962.

The key to doing a good job in the health movement lies in fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and fully mobilizing the masses' eagerness to protect and improve their health, so as to better carry out production, work, study, and accelerate socialist construction, so that health work truly becomes the work of the broad masses of people, and let the masses rise up to fight against their own unhygienic habits. Only in this way can health work show the great role of "changing customs and transforming the world." Therefore, we must make persistent efforts, continue to make great fanfare, create momentum, carry out publicity, vigorously popularize health knowledge, and make this great political significance of health work truly known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

In the current situation of the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the further collectivization of people's lives, health work must closely keep up. Vigorously do a good job in labor protection and health work in industrial and mining enterprises (including industries run by urban and rural communes), fields, and water conservancy and transportation construction sites, do a good job in health work in collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens, including nurseries and kindergartens, and the catering and service industries, so as to more effectively protect people's health and promote production development.

For the diseases that endanger people's health most seriously, we must accelerate their elimination. The southern provinces should still focus on eliminating schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, hookworm disease, etc., resolutely implement the planning and requirements of the Central Committee's Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Leading Group for eliminating schistosomiasis and other parasitic diseases, and make significant achievements in 1960. The north should focus on eliminating endemic diseases such as Keshan disease and Kaschin-Beck disease.

According to the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, health and medical departments in all regions should take supporting agriculture, supporting rural health construction, and improving the level of rural health care as an important political task, and vigorously support it in terms of cadre training, technical guidance, and medicines and equipment. We must actively run county hospitals well, making them the technical guidance center for health care and scientific research in the county and the base for training cadres, and making them the forward position for the health and medical front to support agriculture, and we must actively develop the health cause of the people's communes. Hospitals in various regions should universally carry out the "Patient's Home" movement, continue to implement the policy of "expanding prevention, taking the hospital as the center, and guiding the health prevention work of local areas and factories and mines," further improve service attitude, improve medical quality, and better serve production and serve people's health.

Health work must also be well combined with sports activities to carry out mass-based, diverse sports activities. This way, there will be both active health care to prevent the occurrence of diseases, and active sports exercises to enhance people's physical fitness, which can make the physical fitness of the Chinese people turn from weak to strong, and greatly improve the level of health.

Eliminating pests and diseases, thoroughly transforming the sanitary conditions of China's urban and rural areas, reforming the various bad habits left over from the old society, and developing people's good hygienic habits is certainly an arduous task, but there are no great difficulties. It depends on human effort. As long as we listen to the Party's words, rely on the masses, have perseverance, have determination, have drive, and have courage, we can realize the great goal of changing customs and transforming the world as soon as possible. The broad masses of health workers should be more invigorated, unite with the broad masses under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, be good advisors and assistants to Party committees, and on the other hand, go deep into the masses, go deep into production, go deep into life, and vigorously engage in prevention and treatment work. We must not only teach technology to the masses and be good teachers to the masses, but also be good at learning from the masses and be good students to the masses. Show our ability and play our due role in the mass health movement.

Vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, and climb the peak of medical science

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" is developing rapidly. The health and medical front must also widely and deeply carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, so that China's health and medical work is fully armed with the most advanced technology and theory, and strive to climb the peak of medical science, so as to better serve socialist construction. According to the characteristics of health and medical work, the basic direction and content of the technical revolution in health and medical care should be: First, focusing on the center of eliminating pests and diseases, study the laws of the four pests, innovate and create drugs and tools for eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. Vigorously research and innovate diagnostic tools and methods. Research new therapies and medical equipment, biological products, as well as the principles of preventing and treating diseases and protecting health, and develop medical theories. Second, in line with the "four modernizations" movement, conduct in-depth research on labor hygiene issues, protect the safety and health of the labor army. Health personnel should go deep into the front line of production, become familiar with the production process, understand a series of new problems generated after the "four modernizations," closely cooperate with relevant departments, improve working conditions, and completely solve problems such as poisoning, heatstroke, occupational diseases, and common diseases in industrial and agricultural production. Third, focusing on improving medical quality, medical level, and work efficiency, actively innovate medical technology and continue to improve the medical system. Fourth, creating China's unique new school of medicine is an extremely important task for the health and medical front, and it is also our great goal. We must adhere to the path of combining traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, strengthen the work of sorting out, researching, and improving traditional Chinese medicine, actively develop cutting-edge science and technology, and besiege major cutting-edge medical problems, so that China's medical science can rapidly catch up with or exceed the world's advanced level.

The technical revolution on the medical and health front has an extremely wide scope and rich content. We must start from serving industrial and agricultural production, serving collective life, and serving people's health, closely cooperate with the current development of industrial and agricultural production and the central tasks of health work, implement the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, use both indigenous and foreign methods, carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, grasp the three links of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, and make the movement develop in-depth and persistently along a healthy and correct path.

To carry out the technical revolution, we must take ideological revolution as the pioneer, constantly break superstitions, criticize and overcome various bourgeois ideas and right-leaning conservative ideas, fully mobilize the masses, carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, advocate a pragmatic work style of everything through experimentation, treat the creations and innovations in the movement with enthusiasm, vigorously support new things, and promote the pioneering spirit of the masses, so as to pave the way for the technical revolution. The more thoroughly our ideological revolution is carried out, the more it will inevitably drive the great development and great harvest of the technical revolution. The more the technical revolution is a great harvest, the more it will inevitably promote further ideological liberation, so that the flowers of the technical revolution will be colorful everywhere and full of fruits everywhere. We must establish lofty ambitions, muster sufficient energy, and march towards the goal of creating a new school of medicine and climbing the peak of medical science.

Train health and medical cadres in a more, faster, better, and more economical way

The rapid development of China's socialist construction requires not only expanding the cadre team at a high speed, but also improving the quality of cadres at a high speed. Therefore, we must continue to develop medical education in a more, faster, better, and more economical way under the guidance of the Party's education policy. Not only medical and health colleges and universities train cadres, but all health care and medical scientific research institutions must run medical education on a large scale, and all departments must run senior, intermediate, or primary medical and health schools according to their own conditions. At the same time, we must vigorously support rural areas and develop county-run intermediate health schools and nursery nurse schools. Not only should we run various regular, full-time schools, but we should also take various methods to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to run and run well spare-time medical education, absorb qualified on-the-job intermediate and primary health personnel, and use their spare time to conduct planned and long-term training to enable them to reach the level of senior or intermediate health personnel respectively; we can also vigorously develop correspondence education and various on-the-job training education; vigorously promote the review of traditional Chinese medicine; actively organize health and medical personnel to study on their own, constantly improve their professional level, and vigorously carry out the work of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine health personnel taking apprentices. In rural areas, cities, and factories and mines, we must also closely combine with the patriotic health movement, vigorously popularize health knowledge, and take various measures to train a large number of non-separated or semi-separated health workers, health workers, Red Cross members, and other mass health backbones, and form a strong medical and health team with professional health personnel to meet the needs of the current situation. This is a more, faster, better, and more economical way to strengthen the health work team. To run medical education well, we must adhere to the Party's leadership, put politics in command, further implement the Party's education policy, conduct in-depth education revolution, and vigorously improve the quality of teaching.

Hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and move from victory to victory

Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction, is the truth, is science, and is the criterion for guiding all work. The practice of our country's revolution, the practice of construction, and the practice of our health work have all proved that: doing things according to Mao Zedong Thought will lead to victory; not doing things according to Mao Zedong Thought will lead to mistakes. The entire revolution and construction are like this, and so is a region, a unit, a department, and a specific work. All the victories we have achieved in health work are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of medical personnel are increasingly aware that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of wisdom and strength, "Mao Zedong Thought is the sun, Mao Zedong's works are nutrition, and it is impossible to grow without it." Learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and establishing the correct stand, viewpoint, and method of the working class, is the most fundamental guarantee for continuous revolution, continuous progress, and continuous victory. Our broad masses of medical and health workers must earnestly, deeply, and tenaciously study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds. This is the most important and top political task for each of us. Comrade Lin Feng pointed out in his report: "The political struggle and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are unavoidable throughout the socialist period. Our task is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front to the end, and to continue to carry out the struggle of 'promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie' in all fields of ideology." The situation on the health front in the past eleven years fully proves that without the armament of Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot effectively carry out the struggle of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie," and we cannot obtain high-speed development in our work, and of course, it is impossible to further strengthen the Party's leadership. The struggle of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie" is a long-term revolutionary task, and studying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for winning this struggle.

I hope that the representatives of advanced workers on the health and medical front who are attending the meeting will not only further play a leading and backbone role in eliminating the "four pests," emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating diseases, but also become red flag bearers in studying Chairman Mao's works, and lead the surrounding masses to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, persistently, and in close connection with the reality of ideological work, systematically, repeatedly, and deeply, arm their minds, further criticize and overcome the bourgeois world outlook, and establish and consolidate the proletarian world outlook, so as to ensure that health work moves from victory to victory.

Health workers going deep into the production front in combination with their work, directly participating in physical labor, directly serving the working people, and actually experiencing the life and class feelings of the working people, is a good way for health workers to become both red and expert. In recent years, health workers in various regions have gone out of their doors, went to workshops, went to the countryside, went deep into the masses, combined with production, and served the masses. From "doctors not knocking on doors" to medical care coming to the door, from patients looking for doctors to doctors looking for patients, and from only managing medical care to being fully responsible for the health of the working people, this is indeed a profound ideological revolution for the broad masses of medical personnel. At the same time, because medical personnel have directly contacted production, understood the production process, and discovered pathogenic factors that could not be discovered in the past, the quality of medical and preventive work has been greatly improved, and the professional and technical level of medical personnel has been improved. In the future, all workers on the medical and health front should further carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, go to production labor, serve production, serve the health of 600 million people, strive to transform their thinking, and strive to realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals.

Comrades, the era we are in is the great Mao Zedong era. What appears before us is a thriving and prosperous situation, and what is displayed in front of us is the most glorious, most beautiful, and happiest communist society in human history. Comrade Lin Feng said in his report: "All the work we are doing now is, in the final analysis, to prepare conditions for the transition to communism." Health work, as part of the great cultural revolution, has the great significance of changing customs and transforming the world. Every task we are doing under the leadership of the Party is to prepare conditions for the transition to communism. Our cause is so noble, and the tasks we shoulder are so important. The representatives of advanced units and advanced workers present are the vanguards in completing this great task. I sincerely hope that in future work, comrades will resolutely listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, insist on putting politics in command, be both red and expert, establish the idea of continuous revolution, establish the great ambition of communism, and raise the red flag higher and higher. We must continue to carry forward the communist style, enthusiastically help others catch up with the advanced level, and use our own advanced ideas and actions to lead everyone to improve together. One flower is not spring, but a riot of color is spring. We must achieve no backwardness around the advanced, and one flag rising, ten thousand flags fluttering. We must always maintain a humble attitude of learning, learn from the experience of others with an open mind, and learn from each other's strengths to make up for our weaknesses. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine must strengthen unity, the old and the new must strengthen unity, cooperate with each other, and promote each other. We must achieve flowering in one place and bearing fruit everywhere, and creation in one family and development in a hundred families. Comrades, let us raise the banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, muster greater revolutionary energy, always maintain the honor of being advanced, give full play to our subjective initiative, ride the wind and waves, and march towards the great goal of changing customs and transforming the world.

    高举毛泽东思想旗帜，向移风易俗  改造世界的伟大目标迈进
    ——在全国文教先进工作者代表大会医药卫生
    工作系统会议上的讲话中华人民共和国卫生部部长　李德全
    我代表卫生部向这次大会、向各位代表同志致以热烈的祝贺，祝贺同志们在工作上所取得的巨大成就。
    我完全拥护陆定一同志代表党中央、国务院对大会的指示和林枫同志的报告，以及其他领导同志的报告。这些指示给我们指出了更加明确的努力方向和奋斗目标，使我们获得了无限的力量。这次大会，是大家向党中央和毛主席来汇报成绩、交流先进经验、互相学习、为把我国文化革命推向新的高潮的誓师大会。我深信，通过这一次大会，大家朝着党所指出的方向，进一步发挥骨干作用、带头作用和桥梁作用，紧密团结广大群众，奋勇前进，必然会创造出更优异的成绩，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    建国以来，我国卫生工作在党中央毛主席的关怀领导下，随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，获得了飞跃的发展，取得了巨大的成绩。十一年来，卫生工作的发展过程，也正如陆定一同志所指出的，是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争过程，是社会主义道路与资本主义道路，无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想尖锐斗争的过程。我们高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚决地粉碎了资产阶级右派分子制造的所谓“卫生工作是一种特殊的科学技术工作”、“政治不能领导业务”、“外行不能领导内行”等荒谬论调，彻底打垮了资产阶级右派妄图篡夺党对卫生工作的领导权的进攻，取得了政治思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，并在1959年取得了反对党内右倾机会主义分子的胜利，巩固地树立了党对卫生工作的领导。在两条道路斗争中，我们对卫生队伍中形形色色的资产阶级思想，不断地进行了批判，提高了广大卫生人员的政治、思想觉悟。全心全意为人民服务的思想，和共产主义风格迅速成长起来。随着党对卫生工作领导的日益巩固加强，思想改造的深入发展，卫生事业出现了蓬勃发展的宏伟局面。现在我们已经基本上建成了一个遍布城乡的卫生医疗保健网，一支又红又专的医疗卫生科学技术队伍正在迅速成长起来。党的中医政策已得到全面深入的贯彻，轻视歧视排斥中医的思想有了基本扭转，中西医的团结合作日益增强，在防治疾病、整理研究祖国医学遗产发展医学科学等方面，均取得了新的成就，为创造我国的新医药学派提供了极为有利的条件。药品器材的生产也有了很大的发展，为除害灭病的高速度的进行提供了物质保证。
    以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的群众卫生运动是我国卫生工作的根本任务，也是人民卫生工作的显著标志。几年来从发展生产出发，紧密配合生产，为生产服务，群众卫生运动一浪一浪地不断向前发展。特别是近几个月来，各地贯彻执行了党中央关于卫生工作的指示，各级党委进一步加强了卫生工作的领导，第一书记亲自挂帅，密切结合生产，结合组织人民集体生活和技术革命、文化革命，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大作宣传，掀起了一个广泛深入、规模空前、声势浩大的群众卫生运动的新高潮。广大城乡，各族人民，不分男女老幼，人人动作起来，大除四害，大讲卫生，并结合生产和基本建设，大搞环境卫生，积极改善卫生设施，加强除害灭病的治本工作，清除了大量的四害孳生场所，四害大大减少，城乡卫生面貌有了进一步的改善，越来越多的城市和农村，呈现出整齐清洁、环境宜人的新气象。
    广泛深入的群众卫生运动，有力地改变着我国人民的精神面貌，进一步提高了人们的集体主义思想，破除了旧社会遗留下来的不卫生的迷信观念，以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱的社会新风尚正逐渐形成。不随地吐痰，不乱丢果皮、杂物、烟头，饭前便后洗手，见害就除，见不讲卫生的就劝阻，已逐渐成为人们自觉的行动和日常生活习惯。
    在大搞群众卫生运动中，对各种疾病积极地进行了大规模的群众性的防治工作，实行中西医结合、土洋并举、综合措施，使疾病的治愈率有了显著提高，发病率大大降低。危害人民最严重的霍乱，解放以来从未发生；天花、鼠疫、黑热病也基本消灭。流行在南方十二个省、市、自治区的危害人民健康的血吸虫病，已治疗了五百二十九万余病人；同时还治疗了大量的疟疾、钩虫病、丝虫病患者，并且在不少地区基本消灭了这些疾病。许多过去曾是人烟稀少，田园荒芜的疫区，现在已呈现出“田增产、人增寿、六畜兴旺”的繁荣景象。其他各种急慢性传染病、地方病的发病率和病死率也都大为降低。过去被认为无法治疗的危重克山病、大骨节病也找到了较好的治疗办法。今春以来，出现了更多的无传染病的地区和单位，更有力地支援与促进了生产的发展。
    群众卫生运动与波澜壮阔的技术革新、技术革命运动密切的结合，显著提高了除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的效率和卫生工作的质量。各地革新和创造了大量的除四害、讲卫生的工具和设备，如清扫、出粪出现了机械化半机械化。许多食品加工和炊事用具实现了自动化或半自动化，不但减轻了体力劳动，提高了工作效率，而且减少了食品在操作过程中被污染的机会。在工业卫生方面所取得的成就更为巨大，技术革新的结果，既增强了安全生产，又改善了劳动卫生。很多行业根本上解决了粉尘、毒物的中毒和高温中暑问题；对彻底消灭各种职业病、多发病提供了极为良好的条件。在医疗部门，中西医结合，实现了成千上万的革新项目，革新和创造了很多技术设备和诊断、治疗方法，大大提高了工作效率和医疗质量，缩短了治疗时间，减轻了病人痛苦，许多疑难病症和危急病人得到了有效的治疗和挽救。在药品器材、生物制品等生产部门，有许多实现了自动化和半自动化，不但减轻了体力劳动，而且提高了产量和质量。
    在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，我国卫生事业取得了巨大的成就
    在轰轰烈烈蓬勃发展的群众卫生运动中，涌现出许多卫生先进地区、先进单位和大量的先进工作者。他们在党的领导下，坚决贯彻执行中央的指示，充分显示了“移风易俗、改造世界”的英雄气概。比如众所周知的山西省稷山县和广东省佛山市、四川省重庆市以及南京市的五老村等就是闻名全国的卫生先进地区，现在这些卫生模范县、市、村，正向着更高的标准大踏步的迈进。江西余江县在消灭了血吸虫病之后，相继消灭了钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾和沙眼等疾病。其他各省、市也都涌现出许多卫生先进县、市和先进地区。在卫生运动和各项卫生工作中涌现的先进单位和先进人物就更多了。今天在座的就是这些先进单位、先进人物中的代表，如浙江省嘉兴市第一人民医院坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，出色地完成了繁重的医疗任务，大力开展了预防工作，一年多来创造革新一万多件，并制成多用电子诊疗机等高精医疗仪器；上海市广慈医院抢救钢铁工人丘财康之后，在治疗烫伤方面又有了新的成就；武汉医学院第二附属医院外科教研组抢救装卸工人成德保，为千方百计抢救病人树立了光辉的榜样；山西运城县医院认真贯彻了党的中医政策，积极开展预防工作，获得了很大的成绩；上海高血压研究所和中国医学科学院阜外医院，中西医结合在防治高血压病方面取得了显著成绩；西安医学院克山病研究组发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在攻克克山病的堡垒方面取得了重大的进展；广州部队169医院，两年来未发生医疗事故和医疗差错，并积极开展地方医疗预防工作；芜湖市眼病防治所在防治沙眼工作中，大搞群众运动，开展快速治疗，取得了很大成就；上海第一医学院、北京医学院、西安医学院等，师生结合，大搞群众运动，在教学内容、教学方法等方面进行各种改革，出现了新的气象；江苏省江阴卫生学校认真贯彻了党的教育方针，发扬革命创业精神，白手起家，两年来已办成了一个有八个班级的综合性的卫生学校；山东临清县卫生学校，师生深入农村，结合卫生运动，开展医疗保健工作，帮助基层培养干部，建立组织，采取了边学、边用、边讲、边作的办法，大大提高了教学质量；河南省登封县大冶人民公社把妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园组成一个整体，为全面开展妇幼保健工作创造了良好的经验。
    在先进人物中，有创造高工效治疗血吸虫病、钩虫病的革新能手湖南省女青年医士刘锦桃；有掌握了老鼠生活规律，熟悉了老鼠习性的灭鼠能手吴应今、兰伏太、黎?等；有消灭钉螺的专家沈金保；有灭蚊英雄苑金铎；有舍己为人抢救难产产妇的接生员何凤娥；有以自己的皮肤和鲜血救治了垂危病人的艾拜都拉、吴殿华等；有艰苦奋斗、排除万难为森林工人健康服务的伊春市护士杜桂琴；有全心全意为病人服务，热情耐心传授技术的扬州老中医任继然；有认真学习和钻研祖国医学，取得很大成就的武汉医学院教授金问淇；有勤学苦钻创造多种医疗器械的晋中专区医院外科医生郭统珍；有千方百计为孩子服务的北京市钓饵胡同托儿所保育员王桂祥；有八年如一日，勤勤恳恳，一贯忘我工作的藏族助理护士豆格吉；有为繁荣蒙族人口，为产妇、婴儿健康，任劳任怨，克服种种困难，忍受种种痛苦，经常在沙漠跋陟的蒙族妇幼保健员金钟；有不辞劳苦，热心为人民服务，被驻地群众称颂的“神医”的空军卫生员李洪泉；有坚持政治挂帅，学习毛主席著作，大闹技术革新，提高医疗质量的重庆第一工人医院王景政；有十年如一日积极工作的湛江市清洁工友赵日胜；还有特邀到会的“活着的向秀丽”——王自荣同志等等。总之，卫生工作先进地区、先进单位、先进人物是数不胜数的。这些先进模范单位和人物都是卫生医药人员学习的榜样，都是卫生运动中的红旗、骨干和尖兵。
    同志们，我国卫生事业所取得的巨大成就，和大家在各个工作岗位上所取得的出色的成绩，是党的领导的胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线和各项卫生工作方针政策的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，也是我们不断地进行思想革命的胜利，归根到底，是毛泽东思想的胜利。光荣应该属于我们光荣伟大正确的党，属于我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，属于勤劳勇敢的全国各族人民，属于卫生战线上全体工作同志。
    我们的卫生事业，是保护人民健康，提高人民健康水平的工具，肩负着移风易俗，改造世界的光荣任务。我们所取得的巨大成就，距离这个要求还相当遥远，还只是一个开始。我们必须奋力前进，紧紧跟上我国社会主义建设持续跃进的大好形势，紧密配合工农业生产的大跃进，配合乡村和城市的人民公社化运动，配合文化技术大革命，继续深入开展全民性的除四害、讲卫生，消灭主要疾病的爱国卫生运动，力争提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务，彻底改变我国卫生面貌，大大提高我国人民的卫生知识水平和健康水平。为此，我们必须进一步做好以下几项工作。
    继续大搞群众卫生运动，移风易俗，改造世界
    以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，是战胜疾病、征服自然、移风易俗的伟大壮举，是我们改造世界整个事业的一个重要组成部分，也是进行文化革命的一个重要任务。我们必须坚决地认真地贯彻执行党的卫生工作方针，使伟大的爱国卫生运动更紧密地结合生产和技术革命、文化革命，更加广泛深入地向着更高的阶段发展，进一步推广“稷山”“佛山”卫生工作的经验，创造更多的卫生先进单位和地区，一定要在1960年，1961年，1962年这三年内做出显著的成绩。
    搞好卫生运动的关键在于充分发动群众，依靠群众，把群众迫切要求保护和增进身体健康，以便更好地进行生产、工作、学习，加速社会主义建设的积极性充分调动起来，使卫生工作真正成为广大人民自己的工作，让群众自己起来同自己的不卫生习惯作斗争。只有这样，卫生工作才能够显示“移风易俗、改造世界”的巨大作用，因此，我们必须再接再厉，继续大张旗鼓，大造声势，大作宣传，大力普及卫生知识，使卫生工作的这种巨大的政治意义，真正能够家喻户晓，深入人心。
    在当前工农业生产持续跃进，人民生活进一步集体化的形势下，卫生工作必须紧紧跟上去。大力搞好工矿（包括城乡公社兴办的工业）、田间、水利交通工地的劳动保护和卫生工作，搞好以公共食堂为中心包括托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业和饮食、服务行业中的卫生工作，更有效地保护人民健康，促进生产发展。
    对于危害人民健康最严重的疾病，要加速消灭。南方各省仍以消灭血吸虫病、疟疾、丝虫病、钩虫病等为重点，坚决贯彻执行中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组对消灭血吸虫病和其他寄生虫病的规划和要求，在1960年作出显著的成绩来。北方以消灭克山病、大骨节病等地方病为重点。
    根据发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，各地卫生医药部门，都要把支援农业，支援农村卫生建设，提高农村卫生医疗水平作为一项重要的政治任务，从培养干部、技术指导到药品器材等方面都要大力支援。要积极办好县医院，使之成为全县卫生医疗、科学研究的技术指导中心和培养干部的基地，使之成为卫生医药战线支援农业的前哨阵地，并要积极发展人民公社的卫生事业。各地医院要普遍开展“病人之家”运动，继续贯彻“扩大预防，以医院为中心，指导地方和厂矿的卫生预防工作”的方针，进一步改善服务态度，提高医疗质量，更好地为生产服务，为人民健康服务。
    卫生工作还必须与体育运动很好地结合起来，开展群众性的多种多样的体育活动。这样既有积极的卫生保健以预防疾病发生，又有积极的体育锻炼以增强人民体质，就可使我国人民的体质转弱为强，大大提高健康水平。
    除害灭病，彻底改造我国城乡的卫生面貌，革除旧社会遗留下来的种种陋俗，养成人们良好的卫生习惯，当然是一件艰巨的工作，但也并没有什么了不起的困难，事在人为，只要我们好好听党的话，依靠群众，有毅力，有决心，有干劲，有勇气，就能尽快地实现移风易俗改造世界的伟大目的。广大卫生工作人员应更加振作起来，在各级党委领导下与广大群众结合起来，一方面做好党委的参谋和助手，另一方面又要深入群众、深入生产、深入生活，大搞防治工作。既要把技术教给群众，作好群众的先生，又要善于向群众学习，作好群众的学生。在群众卫生运动中显示自己的能力，发挥应有的作用。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，攀登医学科学高峰
    以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正在迅速的向前发展。卫生医药战线也必须广泛、深入地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，使我国卫生医药工作用最先进的技术、理论全面武装起来，努力攀登医学科学的高峰，更好地为社会主义建设服务。根据卫生医药工作的特点，卫生医药的技术革命的基本方向和内容，应当是：第一、围绕除害灭病这个中心，来研究四害规律，革新和创造消灭四害讲究卫生的药物、工具。大力研究、革新诊断用具和方法。研究新的疗法和医药器械、生物制品，以及预防治疗疾病和保护健康的原理，发展医学理论。第二、配合“四化”运动，深入研究劳动卫生方面的问题，保护劳动大军的安全、健康。卫生人员要深入生产前线，熟悉生产过程，了解“四化”之后产生的一系列新的问题，密切配合有关部门，改善劳动条件，彻底解决工农业生产中的中毒、中暑、职业病、多发病等问题。第三、以提高医疗质量、医学水平、工作效率为中心，积极革新医疗技术，继续改进医疗制度。第四、创造我国独特的新医药学派，是卫生医药战线一个极为重要的任务，也是我们伟大的奋斗目标。必须坚持中西医结合的道路和百家争鸣的方针，加强对祖国医学的整理研究提高工作，积极发展尖端科学技术，围攻医学重大尖端问题，使我国医学科学迅速赶上或超过世界先进水平。
    医药卫生战线上的技术革命，范围极其广泛，内容十分丰富。我们必须从为工农业生产服务，为集体生活服务，为人民健康服务出发，密切配合当前工农业生产的发展和卫生工作的中心任务，实行中西医结合，土洋并举，发扬共产主义大协作的精神，抓好巩固、推广、提高三个环节，使运动沿着健康正确的道路深入持久地向前发展。
    开展技术革命，必须以思想革命为先驱，要不断破除迷信，批判和克服各种资产阶级思想和右倾保守思想，充分发动群众，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，提倡踏踏实实一切经过试验的工作作风，对运动中的创造革新，应热情相待，大力支持新生事物，发扬群众的首创精神，为技术革命开路。我们的思想革命进行的越彻底，必然带动技术革命大发展大丰收，技术革命越是大丰收，必然促进思想更加解放，使技术革命之花，到处万紫千红，遍地硕果累累。我们要树立雄心，鼓足干劲，朝着创造新医药学派、攀登医学科学高峰的目标挺进。
    多快好省地培养卫生医药干部
    我国社会主义建设事业的飞速发展，不仅要高速度扩大干部队伍，而且要高速度提高干部质量。因此，必须继续在党的教育方针指导下，多快好省地发展医学教育，不仅医药卫生院校培养干部，一切卫生医疗、医学科学研究机构都要大办医学教育，各个部门都要根据自己的条件，举办高级、中级或初级医药卫生学校。同时要大力支援农村，发展县办中级卫生学校和保育护士学校。不仅要办各种正规的、全日制的学校，而且要采取各种方式，调动一切可以调动的力量，大办和办好业余医学教育，吸收有条件的在职中级和初级卫生人员，利用业余时间进行有计划的、较长期的培养，使他们分别达到高级或中级卫生人员的水平；还可大力发展函授教育和各种在职进修教育；大搞中医温课；积极组织卫生医药人员自修，不断提高业务水平，并大力开展中西医药卫生人员带徒弟工作。在农村、城市、厂矿还必须密切结合爱国卫生运动，大力普及卫生知识，采取多种多样的措施培养大量的不脱产或半脱产的保健员、卫生员、红十字会员等群众卫生骨干，与专业卫生人员组成强大的医药卫生队伍，以适应当前形势的需要。这是壮大卫生工作队伍的一条多快好省的道路。办好医学教育，必须坚持党的领导、政治挂帅，进一步贯彻党的教育方针，深入进行教育革命，大力提高教学质量。
    高举毛泽东思想红旗，从胜利走向胜利
    马克思列宁主义与中国革命和建设实践相结合的毛泽东思想是真理，是科学，是指导一切工作的准则。我国革命的实践，建设的实践和我们卫生工作的实践，都证明了：按照毛泽东思想办事，就胜利；不按照毛泽东思想办事，就要犯错误。整个革命和建设是如此，一个地区、一个单位、一个部门、一项具体的工作无不如此。我们卫生工作中所取得的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。广大医务人员越来越认识到毛泽东思想是智慧和力量的源泉，“毛泽东思想就是太阳，毛泽东著作就是营养，离开它就不可能成长”，学习和掌握毛泽东思想，树立工人阶级的正确立场、观点和方法，是不断革命，不断前进，不断取得胜利的最根本的保证。我们广大医药卫生工作者必须认真地、深入地、顽强地学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，这是我们每一个人的极为重要的头等的政治任务。林枫同志在报告中指出：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的政治斗争和思想斗争，在整个社会主义时期都是不可避免的。我们的任务，就是要以毛泽东思想为武器，把政治思想战线上的社会主义革命进行到底，在意识形态的各个领域里继续深入地开展‘兴无灭资’的斗争”。十一年来，卫生战线的情况完全证明，没有毛泽东思想的武装，就不能有力的进行“兴无灭资”的斗争，就不能在工作上获得高速度的发展，当然也不可能进一步加强党的领导。“兴无灭资”的斗争是一个长期的革命任务，而学习毛泽东思想则是取得这一斗争胜利的根本保证。
    希望到会的卫生医药战线上的先进工作者代表同志，不仅在除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病方面进一步发挥带头、骨干作用，而且在学习毛主席著作方面也要成为红旗手，带动周围群众刻苦钻研、坚持不懈、联系思想工作实际，系统地、反复地、深入地学习毛主席著作，武装思想，进一步批判和克服资产阶级世界观，树立和巩固无产阶级世界观，保证卫生工作从胜利走向胜利。
    卫生工作人员结合业务深入到生产战线上去，直接参加体力劳动，直接为劳动人民服务，实际去体验劳动人民的生活和阶级感情，这是卫生工作人员走向又红又专的一个好办法。几年来，各地卫生工作人员纷纷走出大门，下车间，下农村，深入群众，结合生产，为群众服务。这样从“医不叩门”到医药上门，从病人找大夫到大夫找病人，从只管医疗到对劳动人民健康全面负责，对广大医务人员来说确是一个深刻的思想革命。同时，由于医务人员直接接触了生产，了解了生产过程，发现了过去不能发现的致病因素，因此就大大提高了医疗、预防工作质量，提高了医务人员的业务技术水平。今后医药卫生战线上的所有工作人员要进一步发扬全心全意为人民服务的精神，到生产劳动中去，为生产服务，为六亿人民的健康服务，努力改造自己的思想，为实现工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化而奋斗。
    同志们，我们所处的时代是伟大的毛泽东时代，出现在我们面前的，是一派生气勃勃、欣欣向荣的大好形势，展示在我们前方的，是人类历史上最光明、最美满、最幸福的共产主义社会。林枫同志在报告中说：“我们现在所做的一切工作，归根到底，都是为了在将来实现共产主义这一崇高的目的”。作为伟大的文化革命一部分的卫生工作，具有着移风易俗改造世界的巨大意义。我们在党领导下进行的每一项工作，都是为了向共产主义过渡准备条件。我们的事业是如此崇高，我们肩负的任务是如此重大。在座的先进单位和先进工作者的代表同志，就是在完成这一伟大任务中的尖兵。我衷心地期望同志们在今后的工作中，坚决听党的话，听毛主席的话，坚持政治挂帅，做到又红又专，树立不断革命的思想，树立共产主义的雄心大志，把红旗越举越高。要继续发扬共产主义风格，满腔热情地帮助别人赶上先进水平，以自己的先进思想行动，带动大家，共同提高。一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春。我们要做到先进身边无落后，一旗升起万旗飘。要永远保持谦虚学习的态度，对别人的经验，要虚心学习，取长补短；中西医要加强团结，新老要加强团结，互相协作，互相促进。做到一处开花，到处结果，一家创造，百家发展。同志们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想旗帜，鼓足更大的革命干劲，永远保持先进的荣誉，充分发挥主观能动作用，乘风破浪，向移风易俗改造世界的伟大目标迈进。
