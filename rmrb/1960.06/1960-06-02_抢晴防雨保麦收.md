    Seize Sunny Days, Prevent Rain, and Protect the Wheat Harvest
    According to weather forecasts, the weather during the summer harvest period will be changeable, with many areas experiencing more overcast and rainy days in June. Seizing sunny days and preventing rain is a tense battle to ensure a bumper summer harvest.
    Amidst the scenes of abundant harvest, we must be most vigilant against complacency and slackness. From autumn sowing to summer harvest, the broad masses of commune members of the people's communes have carried out a series of tense and outstanding tasks, and in many areas have also fought multiple battles against natural disasters, finally winning another great summer harvest. This is, of course, a major event worthy of rejoicing. However, turning the crops in the fields into grain in the granaries still requires a tense battle. "Building a mountain falls short with one basket of earth remaining"; we must not be careless in the slightest degree for the final decisive battle. Farmers call the wheat harvest "snatching food from the dragon's mouth," which means using the most intense actions to fight against rapidly changing bad weather.
    Now, we have such a strong organization as the people's commune, coupled with an increasing mastery of the laws of weather change, and an increasing number of various production tools to improve the efficiency of summer harvesting and planting. Our power to overcome the surprise attacks of wind and rain during summer harvesting and planting is growing stronger. However, to give full play to this power, we must still do a lot of specific work in a realistic and down-to-earth manner, and take some forceful measures.
    Each commune and production team must prepare two or even three sets of plans for summer harvesting and planting, including the preparation of manpower, power, tools, and equipment, the allocation of time, and the arrangement of work procedures. If the summer harvesting and planting period is entirely sunny, there is one set of plans; if it is predicted that there may be wind and rain, there should be a set of plans to try to avoid wind and rain; and there should also be a set of plans to deal with the wind and rain that could not be avoided, or the prolonged drizzling rain. If there is rain, we must prevent rain, resist rain, and rush to harvest; if there is no rain, we must prevent drought, resist drought, and rush to plant. All possible situations should be foreseen as much as possible, and as thorough deployments should be made as possible. It is necessary to ensure that once the weather changes suddenly, practical countermeasures can be taken and effective actions can be taken immediately. The most important thing is that each commune and production team must be fully aware of the maturity of each plot of crops, pay close attention to changes in the weather at all times, and be able to concentrate superior forces without delay according to actual needs, rush to the place where the crops are yellow and ripe, seize sunny days to rush to harvest, transport, thresh, and dry, and at the same time arrange places for threshing on rainy days. Of course, it is best to avoid strong winds and heavy rains during the summer harvest. If wind and rain are encountered during the harvest season, efforts should also be made to harvest in the rain, and various methods should be adopted to dry the wheat. As some local commune members said: "If the sun does not come out in the sky, we will create our own sun!" As long as the Party organizations of the people's communes firmly grasp the leadership, and have both a heroic will and thorough preparations, and everything is arranged properly and implemented at all levels, it can be ensured that a bumper harvest will be brought to the granary in all situations.

    抢晴防雨保麦收
    据气象预报，夏收期间天气阴晴多变，不少地区在6月间多阴雨。抢晴防雨是保证夏季丰产丰收的一场紧张的战斗。
    在一片丰收景象中，我们最要防止的是松懈和麻痹的情绪。从秋种到夏收，人民公社广大社员进行了一系列紧张的出色的工作，在许多地区还同自然灾害进行了多次的搏斗，终于赢得了又一次夏季大丰收。这当然是值得欢欣鼓舞的一件大事。但是，把地里的庄稼变成仓里的粮食，还有一段紧张的战斗的路程。“为山九仞，功亏一篑”；对于最后一场决战，决不可以稍有大意。农民把麦收叫做“龙口夺食”，就是说要用最紧张的行动来同变化很快的坏天气作斗争。
    现在，我们有了人民公社这样强大的组织，再加上越来越多地掌握了天气变化的规律，提高夏收夏种劳动效率的各种生产工具也越来越多，我们在夏收夏种中战胜风雨的突袭的力量是越来越大了。可是，要使这样的力量充分发挥作用，还必须实事求是、踏踏实实地去作许多具体的工作，采取一些有力的措施。
    每个公社和生产队都要做好夏收夏种的两套以至三套计划，包括人力、动力、工具、设备的准备，时间的支配，工序的安排。夏收夏种期间完全是晴天，是一套计划；预测到可能有风雨，要有力求避开风雨的一套计划；还要作一套计划，应付终于未能避开的风雨或者较长时间的霪雨。有雨要防雨抗雨抢收；无雨要防旱抗旱抢种。一切可能发生的情况都要尽量预计到，尽量作周密的部署。要做到，天气一旦发生突然的变化，就能拿出切实的对策，立即采取有效的行动。最要紧的是，每个公社和生产队要对每块庄稼成熟的情况了如指掌，对天气的变化情况时刻留心，要能够按照实际需要，一分钟也不耽搁地集中起优势兵力，哪里黄熟就向哪里突击，抓紧晴天抢收、抢运、抢打、抢晒，同时安排好雨天脱粒的场所。当然，最好是能使夏收避开大风大雨；如果恰在收获时节遭到风雨，也要力求做到一面冒雨抢收，一面采取各种办法把麦子烘干、晾干。正像一些地方的公社社员说的：“天上不出太阳，我们就自己造太阳！”只要人民公社党的组织抓紧领导，又有豪迈的意志，又有周密的准备，事事都安排妥当，层层落实，就能确保在各种情况下都能丰收到仓。
