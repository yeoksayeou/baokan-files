    Xiao Meng's Personality
    Ji Xuepei
    After breakfast, Wu Guozhi invited me to go with him to herd pigs, saying that he wanted me to see the scenery at Huilong Slope.

    His child, Xiao Meng, also went with us. Xiao Meng is an "amateur breeder." He is a fifth-grade student and a young pioneer squad leader. Only on Sundays can he find time to help his father.

    He is only eleven years old this year, but he is tall and thin. Whenever he performs his "duty" on this day, he always likes to wear a belt around his waist and carry a schoolbag; this habit is just like his father always carrying a dry tobacco pouch and a hoe when he goes up the mountain to herd pigs.

    While Lao Wu and I were talking, Xiao Meng was herding the pigs out of the pen. The pigs squeezed and bumped, grunting and squealing, like a river breaking its banks, rolling outwards.

    Suddenly, a group of children ran from the west, all carrying bamboo baskets and sickles. They swirled over like a swarm, laughing and shouting. Two of the naughty ones even used the handles of their sickles to poke the pigs' behinds, scaring them so much that they jumped and bounced around in confusion.

    Xiao Meng got angry and came over to ask, "Who's leading the team today?"

    A chubby child blinked and replied, "Me."

    Xiao Meng took a quick glance and said, "Lengzi, why aren't you taking responsibility? Can't you see what time it is? Why are you still making trouble here?"

    Lengzi smiled, waved his hand, and shouted, "Those cutting grass, follow me!" In the blink of an eye, all the children ran away.

    Lao Wu glanced at Xiao Meng and muttered, "Look at you, showing off!"

    Xiao Meng didn't respond. He cracked his whip sharply and led the pigs forward by himself.

    We crossed a ridge, and below was a flat plain; in the plain, green waves rolled, like a sea of wheat. A straight little road diagonally cut through the wheat sea, heading straight towards the Shahe River.

    A group of girls were pulling wild oats in the wheat field. Laughter and songs merged together, gently lifted by the spring breeze, flying and scattering all the way.

    Hearing the sound of the whip, a girl emerged from the wheat sea and called out, "Xiao Meng, your pigs are eating the wheat!"

    Xiao Meng looked back and saw that she was just teasing him, so he ignored her and walked straight ahead. After a few steps, he stopped and said, "You, come here, come here!"

    The girl asked, "What for?"

    Xiao Meng said, "You'll know when you come and see."

    It turned out that several wheat stalks had been trampled down by people walking by. The girl smiled and said, "These people don't have heels; they always wobble from side to side when they walk!"

    Xiao Meng said, "It's better to blame yourselves than to blame others."

    The girl said, "Blame us?"

    Xiao Meng said, "Of course, blame you. Who told you not to come and check more often?"

    Lao Wu scolded Mengzi, "Go on with your herding, you're too nosy!" As he spoke, he helped the fallen wheat up, and used wheat leaves to tie it together, saying, "Lingzhi, go back and tell your team leader to send someone to watch the roadside more often; it's almost time for 'blowing away the chaff to see the grain,' it would be a pity to waste it."

    As he walked, Lao Wu laughed for some reason, and quietly said to me, "Lao Ji, don't you think it's strange? As the saying goes, 'What kind of tree grows what kind of sprouts, what kind of person raises what kind of child.' But look, our Mengzi is nothing like me at all. He talks a lot and is very chatty, and he likes to meddle in other people's business."

    After Lao Wu mentioned it, I laughed. That's right, in terms of personality, Xiao Meng is indeed different from his father. Lao Wu is a famous "silent gourd," he doesn't talk much, but he always buries his head in his work. For example, last year, the team leader was worried about the problem of pig feed this spring; at that time, Lao Wu didn't say much, but whenever he had time, he carried his hoe to Huilong Slope. At the time, no one knew what he was doing; they only knew that he was digging and digging on the slope, rolling stones all over the mountain. Who knew that at the beginning of this spring, the original barren grassy slope was gone, and a slope of seedlings had grown green. When people went there to take a look, they realized that Lao Wu had planted alfalfa; now, I heard that the alfalfa is already knee-deep, lush and tender, perfect for grazing. Only then did I guess that the reason why Lao Wu asked me to see the scenery today was probably to let me see the alfalfa he planted.

    We crossed the shallow Shahe River and entered the boundary of Huilong Slope. There is a large mountain ridge on Huilong Slope, which looks like a coiled dragon from a distance; here, the dragon just folded, forming a large mountain valley, where twenty or so families live. It is the third team of the Yunguang Production Team, and the village is called Huilongwan.

    Huilong Slope is steep, all terraced fields, but the wheat grows very well. Lao Wu told me that there was originally no water on this slope. Last autumn, during the "Hundred Days of Great Drought," the commune members put in a lot of effort to fight the drought. At the end of the year, the commune party committee transferred 20,000 people at once, and in twenty days, they built twelve reservoirs of all sizes, as well as a large reservoir. In this way, all the rainwater could be intercepted, so as to achieve the goal of "not a drop of water going down the mountain, not relying on the sky in a great drought."

    Sure enough, as soon as we climbed the slope, we smelled a cool, fishy smell of water; and as we went further, there was one reservoir after another; the ponds were full of water, the water glistening, and the channels crisscrossed, just like watermelons growing on long vines.

    We followed a rural road straight up Huilong Slope.

    Climbing up a large flat area, the view suddenly opened up - what a large reservoir! All we could see was: the water rippling, making babbling sounds. Lao Wu told me that he had come to work for ten days when this reservoir was built last year. Because the team was short of mud plasterers at that time, he was responsible for building the sluice gate of the reservoir.

    As he was speaking, Xiao Meng suddenly shouted, "Dad, the reservoir is leaking!"

    Lao Wu asked, "Where?"

    Xiao Meng pointed and said, "Look at the ditch below, it's like a river!"

    Sure enough, just below us, a stream of water as thick as a bucket was bubbling and flowing outwards. Lao Wu frowned and said, "Oh! What's flowing out now isn't water, it's grain."

    Xiao Meng stretched his throat and shouted to the people herding cattle down the slope: "Hurry back and call people, the reservoir is leaking!"

    Lao Wu said, "No need to shout at them, I know where the sluice gate is." As he spoke, he threw the hoe to Xiao Meng and ordered: "Herd the pigs up, hurry up and dig mud." He took off his clothes, ready to go into the water.

    Xiao Meng herded the pigs, raised his hoe and started digging on the shore. I helped him mix the mud. The mud clumps were as big as bamboo baskets; Lao Wu carried them on his shoulders and dived into the water. After a long time, he came up, wiping the water off his face and saying, "It's those damned eels that did it!"

    Lao Wu is truly a skilled swimmer. One clump after another, until the sixth time he came up, he finally plugged the sluice gate.

    While Lao Wu was washing his feet and putting on his clothes, Xiao Meng was sitting on the side, writing something; I walked quietly behind him and saw that he had a composition book on his lap, and he was writing on it with a pencil:

    Big-Character Poster: The Third Team Leader is not careful in his work, he didn't even know that the reservoir was leaking, he should..."

    Lao Wu put on his clothes and shouted over here: "Mengzi, why aren't you hurrying up and driving the pigs, what other tricks are you up to?"

    Xiao Meng didn't look up, and loudly replied, "Writing a big-character poster!"

    Lao Wu snorted and said, "Too nosy!"

    Xiao Meng wet the pencil in his mouth and said to himself, "How is it too nosy? Without criticism, there is no progress..."

    I was shocked and began to understand the child's personality. ...

    小猛的性格
    吉学霈
    吃过早饭，吴国志邀我跟他一块去放猪，说是，让我去回龙坡上看个景致。
    和我们同去的，还有他的孩子小猛。小猛是个“业余饲养员”。他是小学五年级的学生，少先队的小队长，只有星期天，他才能抽出空来做他爹的帮手。
    他今年才十一岁，但是个子却长的又细又高。每逢他执行“职务”的这一天，腰里总爱扎上根皮带，挎着书包；这习惯，就正如他爹每次上山放猪时，一定要带着旱烟袋和锄头一样。
    老吴和我谈话的当儿，小猛正从栏里往外面哄猪，猪们挤撞着，哼叫着，像决了堤的河水，滚滚向外流。
    突然，从西面跑来一群孩子，他们都挎着竹篮，提着镰刀，一窝蜂旋过来，又是笑，又是叫，其中有两个淘气的，还用镰把去戳猪屁股，吓的它们一蹦三跳的乱了群。
    这一来，小猛生气了，赶过来问道：“你们今天谁带队？”
    一个胖滚滚的孩子眨着眼回答：“我。”
    小猛打眼一扫，说：“楞子，你怎么不负起责任来？没看天到啥时候了，还在这里闹？”
    楞子笑了笑，用手一招，喊了声“割草的都跟我走！”转眼工夫，孩子们全跑光了。
    老吴瞥了小猛一眼，嘟哝着说：“看你抖的！”
    小猛却不搭腔，噼哩啪啦地炸着响鞭，领着猪群径自前面走了。
    我们翻过一条岗脊，下面是一马平川；平川里，绿波滚滚，恰似一片麦海。一条笔直的小公路，横斜里将麦海从中劈开，直端端的向沙河伸去。
    一群姑娘在麦田里拔燕麦，笑声、歌声混成了一片，被春风轻轻捧起，一路飞一路飘撒。
    听见炸鞭声，一个姑娘从麦海里钻出来了，叫着说：“小猛，你的猪唠麦了！”
    小猛回头一看，见她是闹着玩的，也不理会，径直往前走。走了几步，站住说：“你来，你来！”
    姑娘问道：“干什么？”
    小猛说：“你来看看就知道了。”
    原来有几蔸麦棵被走路人踏倒了。姑娘笑着说：“这种人没长脚后跟，走路怎么净往两边踅！”
    小猛说：“怨人家还不如怨你们自己。”
    姑娘说：“能怨我们？”
    小猛说：“当然怨你们，谁叫你们不勤来检查？”
    老吴?喝猛子：“走你的路吧，你就事多！”说着，将倒了的麦子扶起来，一边用麦叶缠着说：“灵芝，回去对你们队长说，得派个人勤来路边看着；眼看就到‘吹糠见粮’的时候了，糟踏了多可惜。”
    走着路，老吴不知为什么笑起来了，悄悄对我说：“老吉，你看怪不怪。常言说嘛‘啥树发的啥芽子，啥人养的啥娃子’。可是你看，俺猛子却一点也不像我，话多语稠，还爱管个闲事。”
    经老吴这样一提，我笑起来了。可不是，要从性格上讲，小猛的确跟他爹不一样。老吴是个有名的“闷嘴葫芦”，话不多，可总是埋着头干。比方说吧，去年年里，队长就发愁今年春天猪的饲料问题；那时候，老吴可没多说话，一有空就扛上锄头上了回龙坡。当时，谁也不知道他在干什么，只知道他在坡上挖呀，掘呀，把石头撂的满山滚。谁知今年一开春，原来的荒草狐坡不见了，青荡荡地发了一坡的苗子，人们到那里一看，才知道是老吴种的苜蓿草；现在，听说苜蓿已经膝盖深了，又壮又嫩，正好放牧。这时我才猜想到，老吴今天所以约我来看景致，多半是想让我看看他种的苜蓿的。
    我们淌过浅浅的沙河，就进入回龙坡的境界了。回龙坡上有条大山墚，远远看去，很像一条盘卧的大龙；在这里，那条大龙恰好折了一下，形成一个大山冲，冲里住着二十来户人家，是云光生产队的第三小队，村名就叫回龙湾。
    回龙坡地势陡斜，全是一级一级的梯地，但是麦子却长得十分好。老吴告诉我，这坡上原来没有水，去年秋季“百日大旱”时，社员们抗旱很费了些力。年底，公社党委一下调来了两万人马，二十天工夫，就修了大大小小十二口堰塘，还有一座大水库。这样，就可以把雨水全都截住，作到“滴水不下山，大旱不靠天”的地步。
    果然不错，我们刚一登上坡，就闻到有股浸凉的水腥味；再往前走，就是一口连一口的堰塘；塘满水足，水光闪闪，渠道纵横，恰似一根根长蔓上结满了西瓜一般。
    我们沿着一条乡村大路，直向回龙坡上登去。
    爬上一座大平畈，眼前为之豁然开朗——好大一座水库！只见那：水波荡漾，啵啵有声。老吴对我说，去年修这座水库时，他还来干了十几天呢。因为那时候队里缺泥水匠，水库的剅管，就是他负责砌成的。
    正说着，小猛突然喊道：“爹，水库漏水了！”
    老吴问道：“哪里？”
    小猛指着说：“看下面沟里，简直像条河！”
    可不是，就在我们的下面，桶粗一股水，正翻花冒泡地向外流。老吴皱着眉头说：“呵呀！这会流的不是水，是粮食。”
    小猛扯起喉咙向坡下放牛的人喊：“赶紧回去叫人来，水库漏水了！”
    老吴说：“不用喊他们了，我知道剅管在哪里。”说着，把锄头丢给小猛，命令道：“把猪踅起来，赶紧挖泥巴。”脱了衣服，就要准备下水。
    小猛把猪群踅好，扬起锄头就在岸边挖起来。我帮他和泥团。泥团都有竹篮那么大；老吴扛起来，一个蒙子扎进水里了。半天，才冒了出来，一边抹着脸上的水说：“是鳝鱼个龟孙作的祸！”
    老吴真是个浮水能手。一个蒙子接着一个蒙子，直到第六次上，才把剅管堵死了。
    等老吴洗完脚穿衣裳的时候，小猛却坐在一边不知写什么；我轻轻地走到他的后面，见他膝盖上摊着一本作文本，用铅笔在上面写着：
    大字报：三队队长工作不细心，水库跑了水也不知道，应该……
    老吴穿好衣裳，向这边喊：“猛子，还不赶紧赶起猪走，你又在打什么鬼主意？”
    小猛没抬头，大声回答：“写大字报！”
    老吴哼了一声说：“多事！”
    小猛把铅笔放到嘴里湿了湿，自言自语地说：“怎么多事，没有批评，就没有进步……”
    我心里猛一惊，才开始了解到这个孩子的性格来。……
