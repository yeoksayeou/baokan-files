    Delivering Pesticides Late at Night

    One evening, the staff of the Central Store of the Dahuashan People's Commune in Pinggu County were absorbed in their studies. Suddenly, the telephone rang. It was the Kong Chengyu Production Team calling, reporting that their fruit trees were suffering from insect pests and requesting an immediate supply of pesticides. Upon hearing this, the staff all volunteered to deliver the pesticides to the countryside that very night. They also thought about delivering pesticides to the production teams near Kong Chengyu, so that they could prevent insect pests as early as possible. They rushed to the warehouse, busy weighing and bundling. Before long, all twenty-five employees of the store formed five groups and set off in different directions. At that time, it was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. Li Shuyuan and four other young women, all under twenty years old, took care of each other, running forward with all their might. Hand in hand, they climbed over three mountain ridges before finally reaching the production team.

    That day, Manager Zhang of the store also carried a heavy package of pesticides on his back, leading seven employees to transport more than 700 jin of pesticides overnight. In this way, the store's employees spent three consecutive nights delivering more than 5,000 jin of pesticides and 60 sprayers from their inventory to the production teams in a timely manner. The insect pests were eliminated, and the commune members all said they had done a great job.

    深夜送农药
    晚上，平谷县大华山人民公社中心商店的职工正在聚精会神地学习。忽然电话铃响，原来是孔成裕生产队打来的电话，他们队里果树发生了虫害，要求马上供应农药。职工们听说以后都要求连夜送药下乡，同时大家也想到要给孔成裕附近的生产队送农药，以便及早防治虫害。他们跑到库房忙着过秤、打捆。不一会，全商店二十五名职工编成了五个小组，分头出发了。当时，天黑得伸手看不见五个指头，李淑媛等五个不满二十岁的年青姑娘，互相照顾着，一个劲往前跑。她们手拉着手攀登越过了三道山岭，才找到了生产队。
    那天商店的张经理，也背着沉重的药包，率领着七名职工，连夜运送了七百多斤农药。就这样，这个商店的职工一连利用三个晚上把库存的五千多斤农药、六十架喷雾器，及时送到了各生产队。虫害除掉了，社员们都说他们的功劳大。
