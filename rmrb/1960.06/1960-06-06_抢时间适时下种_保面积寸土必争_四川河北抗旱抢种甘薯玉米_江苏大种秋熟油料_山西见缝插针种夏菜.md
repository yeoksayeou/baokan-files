Sichuan and Hebei Fight Drought to Rush Plant Sweet Potatoes and Corn
Jiangsu Vigorously Plants Autumn-Ripening Oil Crops
Shanxi Plants Summer Vegetables Wherever Possible

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 5th. Sichuan is seizing the current urgent period of spring planting, making decisive decisions to quickly replant some fields that have no guaranteed water source with drought-resistant, high-yielding crops such as sweet potatoes and corn to ensure full planting of spring crops.

Since May, Sichuan has resolutely implemented the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on rushing harvesting and planting, and great achievements have been made in summer planting. As of May 30, the province had planted more than 22 million mu of mid-season rice, more than 4.4 million mu of sweet potatoes, and overfulfilled the planting plan for 8 million mu of corn. However, in some areas, due to the severe drought last year, the water storage in paddy fields was low, and this year's rainfall has been scarce, which has brought certain difficulties to the transplanting of mid-season rice. Currently, the "Grain in Ear" solar term has arrived, and the planting of summer crops has reached an extremely urgent stage. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, Party organizations at all levels immediately took resolute measures. By talking about the situation, calculating the seasonal accounts and increased production accounts, and using the fact that dryland crops planted in place of paddy fields last year yielded high yields, the masses were educated to establish the idea of ​​ensuring planting even without rain and greatly increasing production even in drought. All localities also loudly put forward the battle slogan of "full planting, not a single inch of land wasted," and quickly launched a replanting upsurge. In Nanbu County, Qi Shixun, the First Secretary, personally led the way, and more than 300,000 people in the county were mobilized. Cadres at all levels were assigned to specific areas, and in just one day, they rushed to plant more than 90,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and the quality was good. Leading cadres in Neijiang Prefecture personally took the lead, acting in accordance with local conditions, planning and acting simultaneously. By the end of May, 400,000 mu of dry fields without water for transplanting had been quickly replanted with high-yielding dryland crops such as corn and sweet potatoes.

In the replanting process, leaders at all levels focused on progress while also paying great attention to improving the quality of planting. Intercropping and mixed cropping were vigorously promoted in accordance with local conditions to fully tap the potential of the land.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Under the slogan of "The more drought, the more planting, early planting ensures more harvest," communes in Hebei are launching a crash planting of sweet potatoes to combat drought. By the end of May, more than 5 million mu of sweet potatoes had been planted throughout the province.

In order to ensure planting and survival, all localities have focused on improving the survival rate, given the current severe drought, and have tried every means to find water sources. Qinglong County recently dug 381 new canals, 340 brick and stone wells, 49,000 pits and ponds, and 1,800 underground springs. The sweet potato fields throughout the county have now been watered two or three times, and the survival rate of sweet potato seedlings has reached more than 95%.

Due to the drought, the seedlings are growing slowly. The current shortage of seedlings is the main problem affecting the progress of transplanting. In order to meet the needs of transplanting in time, all localities are vigorously promoting seedling cultivation in the spirit of "grasping transplanting with one hand and seedling cultivation with the other." Xingtai County promoted advanced seedling cultivation experience, adopting seedling cultivation methods such as adding insulation, adding water, adding fertilizer, and high seedling cutting, which accelerated seedling growth and effectively overcame the shortage of seedlings. While vigorously grasping the planting of spring sweet potatoes, all localities are also vigorously developing summer sweet potato seedling bases, strengthening seedling management, and taking measures such as early cultivation, early watering, and early topdressing to promote rapid vine growth and ensure early planting of summer sweet potatoes.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Taking advantage of the bumper harvest of summer-ripening rapeseed, Jiangsu Province is launching a high tide of sowing autumn-ripening oil crops. At present, 1.26 million mu of summer soybeans, 1 million mu of peanuts, and 69,000 mu of sesame have been planted throughout the province.

"Seize the time to sow seasonably, safeguard acreage and strive for every inch of land." At present, the sowing of autumn-ripening crops is in a critical stage. All localities have implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements." While ensuring the completion of the sowing task of grain crops, they have also made every effort for oil crops, striving to complete and overfulfill the planned sowing area as soon as possible. The Taizhou County Party Committee mobilized cadres and the masses to summarize the benefits of planting peanuts and other oil crops, and adopted three major measures: intercropping in wheat fields, interplanting in corn fields, and planting extensively on scattered land, which solved the problem of peanut stubble. By the end of May, 60,000 mu of peanuts had been planted, an increase of 10% over last year.

At present, while rushing to plant peanuts, sesame and soybeans, all localities in the province have also paid attention to the cultivation of small oil crops such as castor beans and sunflowers. The 2.5 billion castor beans and 1.3 billion sunflowers cultivated throughout the province using "ten sides" of idle land are now strong. Initial management of planted peanuts, sesame, and soybeans has begun.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. Shanxi is seizing the current great opportunity, planting summer vegetables wherever possible, and launching a crash planting. As of May 25, more than 1.2 million mu of summer vegetables had been sown throughout the province.

Before the beginning of summer, the Party and government leading organs of Shanxi Province, in accordance with the policy of taking grain as the key link and diversifying operations, arranged summer vegetable production while comprehensively arranging summer planting work. People's communes in various places prepared land, seeds, and fertilizers in a timely manner. When the sowing season arrived, all localities immediately launched a high tide of rushing to plant summer vegetables, "everyone planting vegetables, everywhere planting vegetables." By mid-May, the communes in the suburbs of Taiyuan had rushed to sow and transplant more than 63,000 mu of various summer vegetables throughout the city.

All organs, factories, mines, and schools in the province have also formulated vegetable planting plans based on the annual vegetable needs of their units, and organized cadres, employees, teachers, and students to rush to plant vegetables in their spare time. Many units have also established special vegetable planting guidance groups to strengthen the management and cultivation of vegetables.

    抢时间适时下种　保面积寸土必争
    四川河北抗旱抢种甘薯玉米
    江苏大种秋熟油料　山西见缝插针种夏菜
    本报成都5日电　四川各地抓紧当前大春栽种的紧迫时期，当机立断，将部分确无水源保证的田土迅速改种甘薯、玉米等旱地高产作物，确保大春满栽满种。
    5月份以来，四川各地坚决贯彻中共四川省委关于抢收抢种的指示，夏种工作取得了很大成绩。到5月30日，全省已栽中稻二千二百多万亩，栽甘薯四百四十多万亩，八百万亩中玉米播种计划已超额完成。但是，也有部分地区，由于去年遭受大旱，稻田蓄水不多，加以今年雨水稀少，给中稻栽插带来一定困难。目前，“芒种”已到，夏季作物栽种已经到了极为紧迫的时期。为了保证农业大丰收，各级党组织立即采取了坚决措施，通过大讲形势，算季节账、增产账，运用去年水田改种旱地作物获得高产的事实，教育群众树立了无雨也要保种，干旱也要大增产的思想；各地还响亮地提出“满栽满种，寸土不荒”的战斗口号，迅速掀起了改种热潮。南部县由第一书记齐世勋亲自率领，全县出动三十多万人，各级干部分片包干，仅一天时间就抢栽甘薯九万多亩，而且质量良好。内江专区各级领导亲自上阵，本着因地制宜、边规划、边行动的办法，全县四十万亩无水栽插的干田，到5月底止，即迅速改种了玉米和甘薯等高产旱地作物。
    在改种中，各级领导一面狠抓进度，同时也十分注意提高栽种质量。因地制宜，大量推行套种、间种，充分挖掘土地潜力。
  据新华社天津电　河北各地公社在“越旱越多种，早栽保多收”的口号下，抗旱突击抢插甘薯。5月底，全省已种甘薯五百多万亩。
    为了保栽保成活，各地都根据当前旱情严重的特点，围绕提高成活率这一中心环节，千方百计地挖掘水源。青龙县最近新挖渠道三百八十一条、砖石井三百四十眼、坑塘四万九千个，下泉一千八百多处，全县的甘薯田目前已普遍浇了二、三遍水，薯秧成活率达到95％以上。
    天旱秧苗生长较慢，当前薯秧不足是影响插秧进度的主要问题。为了及时满足插秧需要，各地都本着“一手抓插秧，一手抓育秧”的精神大搞催秧。邢台县推行先进育苗经验，采取加盖保温、加水、加肥、高剪秧等育苗方法，加快了秧苗生长，有效地克服了缺秧困难。在大抓春薯插秧的同时，各地还大搞夏薯薯秧基地，加强幼苗管理，采取早中耕、早浇水、早追肥的措施，促进薯蔓快速生长，保证早插夏薯。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省各地乘夏熟油菜丰收的形势，掀起了播种秋熟油料作物的高潮。目前，全省已种好夏大豆一百二十六万亩，花生一百万亩，芝麻六万九千亩。
    “抢时间适时下种，保面积寸土必争”。目前，各地播种秋熟作物正处于紧要阶段。各地贯彻了“以粮为纲，全面安排”的方针，在保证完成粮食作物播种任务的同时，对于油料作物也尽了一切努力，争取尽快地完成和超额完成计划播种面积。泰州县委发动干部和群众总结种花生等油料作物的好处，采取麦田行里套种、玉米田里夹种、零星土地大种等三大措施，解决了花生茬口问题，到5月下旬就种下花生六万亩，面积比去年扩大10％。
    目前，全省各地在抢种花生、芝麻和大豆的同时，还注意了对蓖麻、向日葵等小油料作物的培育。全省利用“十边”隙地培育的二十五亿棵蓖麻和十三亿棵向日葵，现在株株健旺。已种的花生、芝麻、大豆已开始了初期管理工作。
    据新华社太原电　山西各地抓紧当前大好时机，见缝插针，突击播种夏菜。到5月25日止，全省已播种夏菜一百二十多万亩。
    入夏以前，山西省党政领导机关根据以粮为纲、多种经营的方针，在全面安排夏种工作的同时，就安排了夏菜生产。各地人民公社及时准备了地块、种籽和肥料。当播种季节一到来，各地立即掀起了“人人种菜，处处种菜”的抢种夏菜高潮。太原市郊区各公社到5月中旬，全市已突击播种和移植各种夏菜六万三千余亩。
    全省各机关、厂矿、学校也都根据本单位全年的蔬菜需要量，制订了种菜计划，组织干部、职工和师生，利用业余时间突击种菜。许多单位还专门成立了种菜指导小组，加强了蔬菜的管理和培植。
