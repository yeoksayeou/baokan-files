    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 4th: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Czechoslovak government held a meeting on June 3rd, during which it heard a report from Foreign Minister David regarding the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and a letter from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, to Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak government, Široký, both received by the Czechoslovak government.
    Reflecting the will of the Czechoslovak people, the Czechoslovak government welcomes and agrees with the Soviet government's proposal, and fully supports it. The Czechoslovak government has instructed the Czechoslovak delegation to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee to make every effort to seek a positive solution to the issue of complete and thorough disarmament on the basis of this proposal.
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 4th: According to the Polish Press Agency, the Government of the People's Republic of Poland issued a statement regarding the new Soviet disarmament proposal.
    The statement said that the Government of the People's Republic of Poland received with great satisfaction the new proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on complete and thorough disarmament (a supplement to the plan proposed by Khrushchev at the UN General Assembly on September 18 last year), and believes that this proposal is fully in line with the interests of peace and peaceful coexistence.
    The Polish delegation, together with delegations from other socialist countries, participated in the work of the Disarmament Committee in March this year. Regrettably, the first stage of the committee's work did not yield the expected results. Although the Western countries voted in favor of a resolution mandating the committee to draft a comprehensive and complete disarmament agreement, they continued to insist on supervision of existing armaments and supervision without disarmament during the work of the committee. Therefore, world public opinion had expected that the summit conference would make suggestions to promote the disarmament issue. However, as everyone knows, the meeting was sabotaged by the U.S. government. There is no doubt that the forces of the Cold War are trying to make it impossible to move forward on the road to reaching a comprehensive and complete disarmament agreement by this method.
    The disarmament plan demonstrated by the Soviet Union once again proves the Soviet Union's good wishes and proves that it is prepared to meet the Western countries and actively solve the disarmament issue. This new proof of the unwavering will of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp is very helpful in easing international tensions.
    The Government of the People's Republic of Poland fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal on complete and thorough disarmament put forward on June 2 this year. This proposal is in line with the vital interests of the Polish people, who have been repeatedly devastated by the arms race and aggressive attacks.

    捷波政府支持苏联政府裁军新建议
    新华社布拉格4日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克政府6月3日举行会议，听取了外交部长戴维所作的关于捷克斯洛伐克政府收到的苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军建议和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫致捷克斯洛伐克政府总理西罗基的信的报告。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府反映捷克斯洛伐克人民的意志，欢迎苏联政府的建议，同意这个建议，并且完全支持这个建议。捷克斯洛伐克政府责成出席十国裁军委员会的捷克斯洛伐克代表团尽一切努力，在这个建议的基础上争取积极解决全面彻底裁军问题。
    新华社华沙4日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰人民共和国政府就苏联新的裁军建议发表了一项声明。
    声明中说，波兰人民共和国政府极其满意地接受了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关于全面彻底裁军的新建议，（这个建议是对赫鲁晓夫去年9月18日在联合国大会上提出的计划的补充），并认为，这个建议完全符合和平与和平共处的利益。
    波兰代表团于今年3月同其他社会主义国家代表团一起参加了裁军委员会的工作。很遗憾，委员会工作的第一阶段没有得到预期的结果。尽管西方国家投票赞成委托委员会制定全面彻底裁军协定的决议，但是，在委员会进行工作的过程中，它们仍然坚持只是对现有军备进行监督和没有裁军的监督的主张。因此，世界舆论曾期望着政府首脑会议能作出推动裁军问题的建议。但是，大家知道，会议被美国政府破坏了。毫无疑问，冷战势力企图用这种办法使在达成全面彻底裁军协议的道路上向前进展成为不可能。
    苏联展示出的裁军计划再次证明了苏联的良好愿望，证明它准备迎合西方国家，积极解决裁军问题。苏联和整个社会主义阵营坚定不移的意志的这一新的证明，非常有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    波兰人民共和国政府完全支持苏联于今年6月2日提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议。这一建议符合屡遭军备竞赛和侵略进攻摧残的波兰人民的切身利益。
