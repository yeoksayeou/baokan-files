Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 3rd. In order to complete the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, leading cadres at all levels of the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province have rushed to the forefront of production, solidly grasping the key and weak links in production, thereby rapidly increasing the level of production. The entire mining bureau overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for May, with an average daily output level 2% higher than in April.

Since the second quarter, although production at the Huainan Coal Mine has been relatively stable, the gap in production levels between mines is still large. In order to solve the key problems in production and promote production across the board by focusing on specific points, Kang Zhijie, Secretary of the Mining Bureau Party Committee and Director of the Mining Bureau, led a work group to the Xinzhuangzi Mine, which accounts for more than 20% of the bureau's output; Sun Jin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the Mining Bureau, led a work group to the Xieyi Mine; other Party Committee members and Deputy Directors each went to a mine; and the Party Secretaries and Directors of each mine also went to districts, teams, and shifts to direct production. Yao Ke, member of the Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, Vice Governor, and Director of the Coal Industry Department, and two Deputy Directors also went to Huainan, going deep into the Xinzhuangzi Mine, Xiesan Mine, and other mines to help lead production.

After the leading cadres went deep into the forefront of production, they grasped problems specifically and studied them meticulously, enabling many key production problems to be quickly resolved. Some coal mining teams at the Xinzhuangzi Mine were originally unable to achieve regular cycles. After the leading cadres arrived at the mine, they worked with the workers to identify ten key problems affecting the cycles, organized workers to discuss and offer suggestions, and helped to solve them one by one, which rapidly increased the number of teams achieving regular multi-cycle operation. The daily output in late May increased by 10% compared to the first ten days of the month.

The leading cadres paid attention to summarizing experience and promoting it universally, driving production across the board by focusing on specific points. For example, after the responsible comrades of the Mining Bureau Party Committee and the Provincial Coal Department went to the Xinzhuangzi Mine and helped Coal Mining Team Four to increase its daily coal output by more than double, the Mining Bureau Party Committee, in addition to promoting the experience of Coal Mining Team Four at the Xinzhuangzi Mine, also launched a campaign across the bureau's mines to "Learn from Team Four, Catch up with Team Four," enabling thirteen of the forty-six coal mining teams in the bureau with the same coal mining methods as Team Four to quickly achieve more than two cycles, achieving new successes in exceeding coal production by a large margin.

(By our newspaper) During the Red May steel-winning campaign, leading cadres and all technical personnel of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steel Plant went out of their offices and into the forefront of production, vigorously attacking key production areas, thus promoting the steady rise of various production indicators. The average daily output in the first ten days of May increased by 3% compared with April, and the output in the middle ten days increased sharply by another 26.9% compared with the first ten days. While grasping production preparations for the next month in the last ten days of May, the total monthly output was guaranteed to be 16.6% higher than in April, and the smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by 1.35 minutes, realizing "May surpassing April" and laying a good foundation for "the second quarter surpassing the first quarter."

In order to strengthen production leadership, they established a production headquarters in the factory, and all cadres in the factory, from secretaries, factory directors, engineers, to general technical cadres, concentrated their efforts to go down to work in shifts and groups, going deep into the front lines of the furnace and material yard and working with the workers. The results of this approach were very good. For example, Comrade Teng Hanmin, director of the production competition office, went deep into the weak link of the ingot-making section and discovered the rationalization proposal put forward by worker Guo Zhongxiu to use large cans to receive steel slag, which did not cost money and solved the problem very well, and immediately organized its promotion. In less than a day, all three furnaces and nine shifts in the factory had fully promoted it. Comrade Zhang Zhenxing, the vice-director of the factory who came from an old worker's background, led a "cadre slag-clearing commando team" to vigorously and decisively clear the slag, aiming at the key problem of slag piling up like a mountain in the factory, affecting production and safety. Because of his selfless, hard-working, and pragmatic work, he greatly encouraged the workers. The workers wrote big-character posters to praise him, saying: "Director Zhang is really capable. Leading cadres break through the slag barrier. His drive breaks through the sky. He puts down his iron rod and picks up his drill. Under his encouragement, we have greatly increased our energy, desperately declaring war on the slag, and clearing out a large part of it in an instant."

At present, they are further consolidating, developing, and improving the results of the production battle, determined to twist together into one force and push June's production to a higher level.

According to a report from the Lüda Daily, the Dalian Railway Area Party Committee organized more than 190 cadres to go deep into the forefront of transportation production, participate in production, and lead production, ensuring the rapid rise of railway transportation production. From May 18th to 26th, in nine days, the average daily loading and unloading of vehicles reached 3,039, transporting more than 7,300 tons of goods.

After the Dalian Municipal Party Committee issued a call to strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, the Dalian Railway Area Party Committee convened a Standing Committee and cadre expansion meeting overnight, deciding to draw out some cadres and form three work groups according to the three areas of Dashiqiao, Wafangdian, and Dalian to go deep into the forefront of transportation production and participate in production leadership with grassroots cadres. They adopted various forms such as following shifts, staying at specific points, and making rounds to participate in labor, direct production, and improve work.

Leading cadres at all levels going deep into the forefront of production, participating in production, and leading production has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of employees, setting off a surge in production and promoting a substantial increase in transportation production. The employees of Dalian Ganjingzi Station, due to the launch of a variety of relay delivery operations between the station and related stations and factories and mines within the railway system, including locomotive, train inspection, and station collaboration, were able to load seven rows of cars per day shift in the past at the limestone mine, but now they have increased it to eight rows or more. As a result, this station has transported more than 10,000 tons of goods since May. (Attached photo)

    大连铁路地区近两百名干部亲临前线参加生产改进工作
    据新华社合肥3日电　为了使上半年生产计划提前完成，安徽淮南煤矿各级领导干部奔赴生产第一线，踏踏实实地抓生产关键和薄弱环节，使生产水平迅速提高。全矿务局5月份的原煤生产计划超额完成，平均日产水平比4月份提高2％。
    淮南煤矿进入第二季度以来，生产虽然比较稳定，但是矿与矿之间的生产水平差距还较大。为了解决生产中的关键问题，做到以点带面地推动生产，矿务局党委书记兼矿务局长康志杰，率领工作组到占全局产量20％以上的新庄孜矿；党委副书记兼副局长孙瑾，率领工作组到谢一矿；其他党委委员和副局长都各到一个矿井；各矿的党委书记和矿长也分别到区、队、班，指挥生产。中共安徽省委常委、副省长兼煤炭工业厅厅长姚克和两位副厅长也到淮南，分别深入新庄孜矿、谢三矿等矿井，帮助领导生产。
    领导干部深入生产第一线后，对问题抓得具体，研究得细致，使很多生产关键问题迅速解决。新庄孜矿原来有些采煤队走不上循环，领导干部到矿后，同工人一起找到了影响循环的十个关键问题，组织工人讨论，献计献策，一一具体帮助解决，使实现正规多循环的队迅速增加，5月下旬日产量比上旬提高了10％。
    领导干部们注意总结经验，普遍推广，以点带面地推动生产。如矿务局党委和省煤炭厅的负责同志到新庄孜矿，帮助采煤四队使煤的日产量提高一倍多以后，矿务局党委除了在新庄孜矿推广采煤四队的经验以外，又发动全局各矿开展了“学四队、赶四队”的运动，使全局具有四队同样采煤方法的四十六个采煤队，有十三个队很快达到两个循环以上，获得了煤炭大量超产的新成绩。
    本报讯　在红5月夺钢大会战中，太原钢铁公司第一炼钢厂领导干部和全体技职人员纷纷走出办公室，深入生产第一线，猛攻生产关键，从而促使各项生产指标节节上升。5月上旬平均日产量比4月份提高3％，中旬比上旬又猛增26．9％，下旬在抓下月生产准备的同时，保证了全月总产量比4月提高了16．6％，每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短一点三十五分，实现了“5月超4月”，为“二季超首季”，打下良好的基础。
    为了加强生产领导，他们在厂部成立了生产总指挥部，全厂所有干部，从书记、厂长、工程师到一般技职干部都集中力量下去分班分组，深入炉前、料场等前线和工人同劳动。这样作的结果，效果很好。如生产竞赛办公室主任滕汉民同志，深入薄弱环节制锭工段后，发现工人郭钟秀提出的用大罐接出钢渣的合理化建议，不花钱又很解决问题，便立即组织推广。不到一天全厂三个炉、九个班就全部推广了。老工人出身的副厂长张振兴同志，针对厂内渣子堆积如山，影响生产、安全的关键问题，带领“干部清渣突击队”，雷厉风行，突击清除渣子。由于他奋不顾身，苦干、实干，对工人鼓舞很大。工人们写大字报表扬道：“张厂长真能干，领导干部破渣关，他的干劲冲破天，放下铁棍就拿钎。我们在他鼓舞下，浑身干劲猛增加，拼命向渣子来宣战，霎时清除了一大半”。
    目前，他们正在进一步巩固、发展、提高生产大会战这一战果，决心上下扭成一股劲，把6月份生产推向更高的水平。
    据旅大日报消息　大连铁路地区党工委组织了一百九十多名干部深入运输生产最前线，参加生产，领导生产，保证了铁路运输生产迅速上升。5月18日至26日九天，日装卸车量平均达到了三千零三十九车，多运送了七千三百多吨货物。
    中共旅大市委发出力争上半年完成全年计划一半的号召后，大连铁路地区党工委连夜召开常委会和干部扩大会议，决定抽出部分干部，按大石桥、瓦房店、大连三个地区组成三个工作组，深入运输生产最前线，和基层干部一起参加生产领导生产。他们采取跟班劳动、蹲点、巡回等多种多样形式参加劳动，指挥生产，改进工作。
    各级领导干部深入生产最前线，参加生产领导生产，大大鼓舞了职工的生产积极性，掀起了生产大高潮，促进了运输生产大幅度上升。大连甘井子站职工由于和铁路内部有关站和厂矿之间展开了机务、列检、车站间大联合多种接力取送作业表演赛，过去进石灰石矿装车日班能装七排，现在提高到八排以上，因而这个站5月以来，多运送了一万多吨货物。（附图片）
