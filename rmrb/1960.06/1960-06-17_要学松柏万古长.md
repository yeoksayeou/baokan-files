Aspire to the Everlastingness of Pine and Cypress

In the "Children's Poems" section on May 18th, I saw my poem "Eliminating the Four Pests" and Grandpa Guo Moruo's words. I felt very excited and wrote the following lines: Do not learn from the ephemerality of the昙花, but learn from the everlastingness of pine and cypress. I am not arrogant or complacent, and I will always remember Chairman Mao's words to study hard and make progress every day. Grandpa, please set your mind at ease!

    要学松柏万古长
    在5月18日“孩子的诗”栏里，看到我写的那首“除四害”和郭沫若伯伯的话，心里很兴奋，写了下边这几句：不学昙花一时放，要学松柏万古长。我不骄傲、不自满，永远记住毛主席的话，好好学习，天天向上。伯伯请你把心放！
