(Our Shanghai Dispatch, June 22nd) The General Party Branch of the Shanghai Wanguo Rubber Factory, in promoting the experience of the major technological innovation of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing," further improved its leadership style, resolutely relied on the masses, fully listened to various different opinions, and actively took measures to conscientiously solve problems. At the critical juncture of "whether or not to go back," it firmly supported the correct opinion, enabling the newly tested and successful technology to be rapidly applied to production, achieving a triple harvest of thought, production, and innovation.

Using Compressed Air Instead of Iron Cores Saves Labor, Trouble, and is Safe

"Non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" is a major innovation in the rubber industry. In the past, the production procedure of the Wanguo Rubber Factory was to insert an iron core into the rubber tube, then wrap it with rubber cloth and rubber, and then heat it for "vulcanization" to produce the finished product. Using this method for production, workers had to carry iron cores weighing hundreds of pounds back and forth, which was not only labor-intensive but also frequently resulted in work-related injuries; the production process involved thirty-five steps. At the end of March this year, the factory workers, after three days of hard work, successfully tested a new technology, namely, using compressed air instead of iron cores. This reduced the original thirty-five steps to ten, greatly reduced labor intensity, and eliminated work-related injuries, fundamentally changing the technical face of rubber tube production.

Insufficient Preparation Leads to Obstacles in Production

In early April, when preparations were not fully made, "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" was officially put into production, resulting in an uproar. Originally, using the old method to produce rubber tubes, each shift could produce one hundred and thirty tubes; now, using the new method, only twenty or so tubes could be produced, and in some cases, only ten or so. Production decreased by 90%; and the quality could not be guaranteed, with scrap rates often as high as 96%.

Regarding this situation, initially, many cadres in the factory only had a general idea: "New things, you know, are bound to have some shortcomings at the beginning, and they will gradually get better." They thought that some defects in new things would disappear on their own. Therefore, although they also tried some methods, such as several leading cadres working in the workshop with the workers every day, they did not fully mobilize the masses and conduct specific analysis based on specific situations. As a result, after ten days, the shift output of rubber tubes was still only about fifty, and after half a month, the monthly plan was only 32.2% completed; the quality never improved. At this time, regarding the matter of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing," discussions were rife throughout the factory. Some workers said, "Non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing is a good thing, but how can we complete the plan? Let's use iron cores." Some workers simply started using the old methods to produce.

Why are Workers Unwilling to Use New Technologies?

What is the Correct Attitude Towards New Things?

The situation was urgent. The new thing "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" was facing a severe test. Guo Guihua, the secretary of the General Party Branch and director of the factory, walked back and forth in the rubber tube workshop all day, touching here, asking there, with all sorts of questions swirling in his mind: Where exactly are the problems with "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing"? Why have workers been hoping to get rid of iron cores for so many years, but now that they have been discarded, they are secretly using the old methods to work at night? It is inevitable that new things will have shortcomings at the beginning, and it is necessary to resolutely protect them, but waiting for them to grow and develop is not a solution! One night, he and Deputy Director Zhang Dezong discussed it together.

"Is the direction of non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing correct or not?" After calm analysis, the two of them affirmed that the direction was correct. If it was fundamentally wrong, why could they produce such good rubber tubes at the beginning of the experiment? The problem lay in the cadres' lack of thorough work style. They neither understood where the problems were nor had a "waiting mentality" towards new things, and therefore did not fully mobilize the masses to clarify the main attack direction and tackle key issues with the masses. The two reached an agreement and decided to hold an enlarged meeting of the General Party Branch to conduct a major theoretical discussion. After unifying the understanding within the Party, they would hold a mass meeting to launch a major debate.

Party Secretary Explains the Bottom Line to the Masses and Launches a Great Debate

At the enlarged meeting of the General Party Branch the next morning, the Party Secretary listened to various different opinions and decided to let go and mobilize the masses, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to solve key technical problems.

Then a factory-wide staff meeting was held. The Party Secretary explained the situation after the "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" was put into production to the masses, and also told the masses about the leadership's intentions, asking everyone to express their views freely and fully discuss the matter. Thus, a fierce debate unfolded.

If Two Out of Fifty are Good, Can't the Forty-Eight Be Good Too?

At the beginning of the debate, the opinion of temporarily using the old method again prevailed. Some people said, "Let's change it back!" However, many people at the meeting also raised different opinions. Old workers Shen Daosheng and Zhang Wancai, in order to solve the problem of rubber tube output and quality, thought about it while walking and while eating. They excitedly stated at the meeting: "We have to carry iron cores weighing hundreds of pounds up and down every day. Now that we don't use iron cores, we are liberated from heavy physical labor. This is a huge good thing! Now the output and quality are not good, but why don't we think of a solution? Why are we in a hurry to go back?" Everyone talked at once, and no one could convince anyone else. At this time, a young worker named Zhang Manzhang stood up and said loudly: "I have a question. The rubber tubes we produce without iron cores, aren't they all bad? If we produce fifty tubes in a shift, and forty-eight tubes are bad, but there are still two tubes that are good! Since there are two tubes that are good, why can't those forty-eight tubes be good too?" As soon as these words were said, the whole audience immediately caused a sensation. That's right! Why only see the forty-eight bad ones and not see that there are still two good ones! Zhang Manzhang's words opened people's minds, and everyone's thinking suddenly became clear. People who originally did not understand now understood, people who advocated going back changed their minds, and people who were waiting and watching also felt that there was a way out.

The Debate Turns into a Research Conference to Analyze and Dissect to Find Key Issues

The debate immediately turned into a research conference. Everyone spoke their mind, based on their experience in production practice, analyzed and dissected the current problems of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing," looking for key issues while thinking of solutions and proposing measures. Finally, the General Party Branch Committee summarized everyone's opinions. It turned out that the reason why the new technology of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" currently caused low output and poor quality was that, in addition to the fact that the preparation work for putting the new technology into production was not detailed enough, also: first, the technical hurdle had not yet been passed, and many key technical issues had not yet been resolved; second, the workers were not skilled or accustomed to the operation, "having a thoroughbred but not knowing how to ride it"; third, the enterprise management work had not kept up, especially the labor organization had not been adjusted in time, causing chaos. The Party Secretary enthusiastically announced: "Now that the main problems have been found, relying on everyone's efforts, we will definitely be able to solve these problems and let the new technology of non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing blossom and bear fruit in our factory!"

After three days of expression of views and debate, everyone's opinions were expressed. The more people discussed, the more solutions they found, and the more solutions they had, the more confident they became. Immediately afterwards, the General Party Branch took practical and effective measures based on the key issues that had been found and re-deployed the combat. It was decided that the Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Deputy Director, Chairman of the Labor Union, and Party Branch Secretary would "divide their troops into five routes" to go deep into the main work sections to work alongside the workers and "learn from experience" in brother factories, first attacking the technical hurdle. When the workers saw the leading cadres coming to the front line to solve practical problems, their enthusiasm was even greater and their confidence was full. At this time, although the output and quality of rubber tubes had not yet improved significantly, the atmosphere was very different; everyone was no longer frowning but was full of vigor and high morale, and they all guaranteed that they would definitely make a name for themselves.

As Long as the Work is Done Carefully, You Don't Have to Fear That the Root Cannot Be Dug Out

The Party Secretary went down to the "vulcanization" work section. While working alongside the workers, he studied with the workers and technicians and found that two shifts of workers had inconsistent operation methods during water injection vulcanization. Which method is better? The masses must come to a conclusion themselves. He immediately convened a special discussion for the workers and inspected the finished products one by one. He found the key technology and immediately discussed and solved it, and the quality improved. One problem was solved, and another problem was discovered. In this way, problems were discovered and solved, one technical key after another was found and broken through, the output of rubber tubes rose day by day, the quality gradually improved, and the advantages of new things became more and more obvious. In order to further consolidate, promote, and improve new technologies, the General Party Branch decided to mobilize the masses to summarize their technical experience. Then each class held a mass meeting, where they exchanged experience, discussed, analyzed, and summarized, affirming what could be affirmed, and continuing to improve what needed to be improved, and promoting it in a timely manner. At this point, the technical hurdle was broken through.

Once the technical hurdle was overcome, the next step was to solve a series of problems in the operation method. According to the requirements of the masses, the General Party Branch first held a small exhibition, displaying rubber tubes produced by various different operation methods, analyzing and dissecting them, and conducting mass appraisal. Many workers watched and discussed, and proposed many good suggestions on the spot. At the exhibition, the operation method of the Xue A'jin group was more perfect and received everyone's attention. The General Party Branch organized workers to visit this group and organized a casual talk on the spot. After everyone watched, talked, and appraised, the operation experience of this group was summarized into the "four-good" operation method. Next, the General Party Branch used the technical experience and "four-good" operation method summarized by the workers themselves as content to hold technical classes and organize workers to learn, so that advanced experience could be promoted in a timely manner, and the output and quality of rubber tubes were further improved. Finally, the General Party Branch mobilized the workers to talk about their experience and used the method of "three combinations" of cadres, workers, and technicians to concentrate everyone's experience, and after repeated discussions, formulated the "Non-Ferrous Core Rubber Tube Forming Operation Method." At present, this operation method has been mastered by all workers and has become everyone's common wealth.

Output Increased Rapidly and Labor Organization Followed Up

While summarizing technical experience and formulating operating procedures, the labor organization was also adjusted accordingly. After the new technology of non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing was put into production, because the production process was reduced from thirty-five steps to ten steps, the original workers who engaged in core insertion, tube removal, and cloth removal now had no fixed positions, and everyone was looking for work everywhere, causing a certain degree of confusion, affecting the normal production and quality improvement. Finding this key issue, the labor organization was adjusted in a timely manner through mass analysis and discussion, changing the original seventeen people in a shift to nine people; at the same time, the labor force saved was used to increase the third shift, and seven laborers were transferred to support other work. The process route was also adjusted, connecting the four processes of forming, extrusion, vulcanization, and packaging to form a production line, greatly reducing the phenomenon of confusion and improving labor productivity.

Thorough and Detailed, Down-to-Earth, Quality Improvement, and Output Surge

The new thing of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing" was finally successful through thorough and down-to-earth leadership. From the end of May, the production of rubber tubes in this factory not only fully returned to normal but also greatly exceeded the level before the new technology was adopted. In the past, with two shifts, each shift produced 130 rubber tubes. Now, with three shifts, each shift produces 188 rubber tubes; the pass rate of products is as high as 97%, the quality has been greatly improved, and the performance is more tough and the appearance is smoother than before. Savings in raw materials: It is estimated that 30 tons of steel, 20 tons of gasoline, and more than 1,400 bolts of fine cloth can be saved every year. The factory area can also save two-thirds. The entire production of rubber tubes is more, faster, better, and more economical than in the past.

Now, the employees of this factory are beaming with joy. While celebrating the blossoming and fruitfulness of the new technology of "non-ferrous core rubber tube manufacturing," they have also taken new steps on the road of technological revolution. The workers in the third workshop worked hard for two days and have realized a new vulcanization technology, and comprehensively promoted it in three days, rapidly applying it to production. The second workshop has also made a new technology for rubber roller forming. The workers in the rubber tube workshop are advancing victoriously, marching towards workshop automation. The whole factory is in full swing, determined to make greater achievements in the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the results of the technological revolution, and to ensure a substantial increase in production.

    怎样巩固、推广，提高革新成果？
    万国橡胶厂回答：深入细致　踏踏实实
    本报上海22日电　上海万国橡胶厂党总支在推广“无铁芯制胶管”这一重大技术革新经验中，进一步改进领导作风，坚决依靠群众，充分听取各方面的不同意见，并积极采取措施，认真解决问题，在“要不要走回头路”的紧要关头，坚定地支持了正确的意见，使已经试验成功的新技术迅速用于生产，取得了思想、生产、革新三丰收。
    压缩空气代铁芯省力省事又安全
      “无铁芯制胶管”是橡胶工业中的一项重大革新。过去万国橡胶厂的生产程序是用一根铁芯穿进胶管里面，外面再缠胶布和胶皮，然后加热“硫化”后出成品。用这样的方法生产，工人要把上百斤重的铁芯扛来扛去，不仅劳动强度高，而且经常会发生工伤事故；生产过程要经过三十五道工序。今年3月底，这个厂的工人经过三天苦战，试验成功了一项新技术，即用压缩空气代替铁芯。这样就使原来的三十五道工序减少为十道，大大减轻了劳动强度，消灭了工伤事故；从根本上改变了胶管生产的技术面貌。
    准备工作不充分投入生产受阻碍
    4月初，当准备工作做得不够充分的时候，“无铁芯制胶管”就正式投入生产，结果引起了一场风波。原来用老办法生产胶管，每班可生产一百三十根；现在采用新办法，只能生产二十多根，最少的只能生产十多根。产量下降了90％；而且质量还得不到保证，废品率往往高达96％。
    这一情况的出现，起初这个厂的许多干部只有一个笼统的概念：“新生事物嘛，开头总难免有些缺点，慢慢就会好起来的。”以为新生事物的某些缺陷，是会自行消灭的。因此，虽然也想了一些办法，如几个领导干部天天在车间里同工人一道劳动等，但没有充分发动群众，针对具体情况进行具体分析。结果，十天过去了，胶管的班产量还只有五十根左右，半个月过去了，月计划还只完成32．2％；质量始终不见提高。这时，围绕着“无铁芯制胶管”这件事，全厂上下议论纷纭。有些工人说：“无铁芯制胶管是件好事情，可就是完不成计划，怎么办？还是用铁芯吧。”有些工人就干脆用老办法生产起来了。
    为什么工人不愿意使用新技术？
    什么是对待新生事物的正确态度？
    情况是紧急的。“无铁芯制胶管”这个新生事物受到了严重的考验。党总支书记兼厂长郭桂华整天在胶管车间里走来走去，摸摸这里，问问那里，脑子里翻腾着各种各样的问题：“无铁芯制胶管”的毛病究竟在哪里？为什么工人多少年来盼望掼掉铁芯，如今掼掉了，又要在夜里偷偷摸摸地用老办法干活？新生事物开头是难免有缺点的，必须坚决保护它，可是坐等它的成长壮大也不是办法呀！一个晚上，他和副厂长张德忠一道谈论起来。
  “到底无铁芯制胶管方向对头不对头？”经过冷静分析，两个人肯定方向是对头的。如果根本错了，为什么在开始试验的时候，能生产出那么好的胶管来呢？问题在于干部作风不深入，既不了解问题究竟在哪里，对待新生事物又存在着“等待思想”，因而没有充分发动群众，明确主攻方向，同群众一道找关键、攻关键。两个人的意见取得了一致，便决定召开党总支扩大会议，进行大务虚。在统一党内认识以后，再举行群众大会展开大辩论。
    党委书记向群众交底展开大鸣大放大辩论
    在第二天早晨党总支扩大会议上，党总支书记倾听了各种不同意见之后，决定放手发动群众，集中群众的智慧，来解决技术关键问题。
    接着举行了全厂职工大会，党总支书记把“无铁芯制胶管”投入生产以后的情况向群众交底，把领导意图也告诉了群众，要求大家大鸣大放，充分讨论。于是一场激烈的辩论展开了。
    五十根中间有两根是好的  四十八根就一定好不了吗
    辩论一开始主张暂时还是用老办法的意见又占了上风。有人说，还是改回来吧！会上也有不少人提出了不同的意见。老工人申道生、张万才，为了解决胶管的产量质量问题，他们走路想，吃饭想。他们在会上激动地表示：“我们天天要把上百斤重的铁芯扛上扛下，现在不用铁芯了，我们从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来了，这是件天大的好事情啊！现在产量质量是不好，但为什么不想想办法呢？为什么要急于走回头路呢？”大家七嘴八舌，谁也说服不了谁。这时，一个青年工人张满章站了起来，大声地说：“我来提个问题。我们不用铁芯生产的胶管，不是每一根都是坏的。一班生产五十根，四十八根是坏的，可还有两根是好的呀！既然有两根是好的，为什么那四十八根就一定好不了呢？”这几句话一说，全场马上就轰动起来。说得对呀！为什么只看到四十八根坏的，却看不到还有两根好的呢！张满章的话打开了人们的思路，大家的思想豁然开朗了。原来思想不通的人思想通了，主张走回头的人改变了主意，坐等观望的人也感到有门路了。
    辩论会变成研究会分析解剖寻找关键
    辩论会顿时变成了研究会。大家你一言我一语，根据自己在生产实践中的体会，把“无铁芯制胶管”眼前的毛病进行了分析解剖；边找关键，边想办法，边提措施。最后，党总支委员会把大家的意见作了归纳。原来“无铁芯制胶管”这项新技术，眼前所以会造成产量低质量差，除了新技术投入生产的准备工作做得不够细致外，还由于：第一，技术关还没有过，许多技术上的关键问题还没有解决；第二，工人操作上还不熟练、不习惯，“有了千里马还不会骑”；第三，企业管理工作没有跟上，特别是劳动组织没有及时调整，造成忙乱。党总支书记热情地宣布：“现在主要问题已经找到了，依靠大家的努力，我们一定能够解决这些问题，叫无铁芯制胶管这项新技术在我们厂里开花结果！”
    经过三天的鸣放辩论，大家的意见都谈出来了。越议论越有办法，越有办法就越有信心。紧接着党总支便针对已经找出来的关键，采取切实有效的措施，重新作了战斗部署。决定由党总支书记、副书记、副厂长、工会主席、党分支书记“五路分兵”，深入到主要工段跟班劳动和到兄弟厂“取经”，首先进攻技术关。工人群众看见领导干部亲临前线解决实际问题，劲头更大，信心十足。这时胶管的产量和质量虽然还没有什么显著提高，但气氛大不相同；大家不再是愁眉苦脸了，而是意气风发，斗志昂扬，纷纷保证一定要搞出个名堂来。
    只要工作做得细不怕根子挖不出
    党总支书记下到“硫化”工段。在跟班劳动中，他和工人与技术人员一起研究，发现有两班工人在灌水硫化时操作方法不一致。到底哪个办法好？要由群众自己来作结论。他便立即召集工人进行专题讨论，并逐个检验成品。找到了技术关键，马上就边讨论，边解决，质量果然有了改进。一个问题解决了，一个问题又发现了。就这样发现问题解决问题，一个一个的技术关键被找到了，攻破了，胶管的产量逐日上升，质量逐步提高，新生事物的优越性越来越明显。为了进一步巩固、推广、提高新技术，党总支就决定发动群众自己总结技术经验。接着各班召开群众大会，会上边交流经验，边议论，边分析，边总结，可以肯定的就肯定下来，需要改进、提高的就继续改进、提高，并及时加以推广。至此，技术关是突破了。
    技术关一攻克，接下来就要解决操作方法上的一系列问题。党总支根据群众的要求，首先举办了小型展览会，把用各种不同操作方法生产的胶管都陈列出来，加以分析解剖，进行群众性的鉴定。许多工人边看边议论，当场提出不少很好的建议。在展览会上，薛阿金小组的操作方法比较完善，受到大家的注意。党总支就组织工人到这个小组去参观，并就地组织漫谈。经过大家边看，边谈，边鉴定，就把这个小组的操作经验总结成“四好”操作法。接着，党总支就以工人群众自己总结出来的技术经验和“四好”操作法为内容，举办技术课，组织工人学习，使先进经验及时地得到推广，橡胶管的产量和质量又有了进一步的提高。最后，党总支又发动工人大讲经验，运用干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”的方法，集中大家的点滴经验，经过反复讨论，制订了“无铁芯胶管成型操作法”。目前，这个操作法已为所有的工人所掌握，成为大家共同的财富。
    产量迅速提高了劳动组织跟上去
    在总结技术经验、制订操作规程的同时，劳动组织也作了相应的调整。当无铁芯制胶管的新技术投入生产以后，由于生产工序由三十五道减为十道，原来搞插芯、拔管、解布的工人，现在都没有固定的岗位，大家到处找活干，造成了一定程度的混乱，影响到生产的正常进行和质量的提高。找到了这个关键性的问题，便通过群众性的分析讨论，及时调整了劳动组织，把原来一班十七个人改为九个人；同时还把节余下来的劳动力增开了第三班，并调出了七个劳动力支援其他工作。工艺路线也作了调整，把成型、压出、硫化、打包四道工序衔接起来，组成一条生产流水线，大大减少了忙乱现象，提高了劳动生产率。
    深入细致踏踏实实质量提高产量猛升
      “无铁芯制胶管”这件新生事物，经过深入细致、踏踏实实的领导，终于成功了。从5月下旬开始，这个厂橡胶管的生产不仅完全恢复正常，而且大大超过了采用新技术以前的水平。过去两班制，每班生产胶管一百三十根，现在三班制，每班生产一百八十八根；产品的合格率高达97％，质量大大提高，性能比以前更坚韧、外观更光滑了。原材料的节省：预计每年可以节省钢材三十吨、汽油二十吨、细布一千四百多匹。厂房面积也可以节省三分之二。整个胶管的生产，比过去更多更快更好更省。
    现在，这个厂的职工喜气洋洋，在欢庆“无铁芯制胶管”这项新技术开花结果的同时，又在技术革命的大道上迈开了新的步伐。第三车间工人苦战二天，已经实现一项硫化新技术，并在三天中全面推广，迅速用于生产。第二车间也搞成了胶辊成型新技术。胶管车间的工人正在乘胜前进，向车间自动化进军。全厂一片热气腾腾，决心在技术革命成果的巩固、推广、提高工作中作出更大成绩，保证生产的大幅度增长。（附图片）
