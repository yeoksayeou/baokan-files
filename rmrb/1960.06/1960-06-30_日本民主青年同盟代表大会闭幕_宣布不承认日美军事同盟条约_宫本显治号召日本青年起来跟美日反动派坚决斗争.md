Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 27th: The Sixth National Congress of the Japan Democratic Youth League concluded its three-day meeting today. The congress passed a resolution declaring non-recognition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and called on youth around the world to engage in a common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The policy direction adopted by the congress for the current Democratic Youth League stipulates that the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is an important task for the Democratic Youth League. It pointed out, "Members of the Youth League should expose the reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly organizations in all available occasions, especially in the more than two thousand joint struggle organizations opposing the 'Security Treaty'."

The congress also passed an appeal to all Japanese youth. The appeal pointed out that the responsibility of the Japanese people and youth is to build a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan. The appeal said, "Only through the struggle for building such a Japan can we open up the bright future of socialism."

The congress discussed the issue of expanding the organization of the Democratic Youth League, and decided to increase the league's membership to 300,000 in the near future.

The congress revised the constitution of the Democratic Youth League and elected a new leadership.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: At a gathering held by the Japan Democratic Youth League on the 26th, Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, called on Japanese youth to fight for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" and to smash the conspiracy to establish a "Second Kishi Cabinet."

Miyamoto said that the youth of socialist countries, under the care of their states, are full of confidence and are moving towards a communist society. Only when the whole world becomes a socialist and communist society can peace be fully guaranteed.

Miyamoto said that in Japan, the rule of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Japanese monopoly capital group hinders Japan from moving towards this bright road. In order to create a bright future for youth and strive for independence, peace, and democracy, all Japanese youth must stand up and defeat these two enemies. He said that this is the historically significant task at present.

Miyamoto said that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are currently plotting to organize a "Second Kishi Cabinet" relying on the Japanese army and U.S. imperialist military power. To smash this conspiracy and win the final victory, a prerequisite is to force the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and the abolition of U.S. military bases.

Miyamoto emphasized that organizing a caretaker cabinet by all anti-Kishi forces and relentlessly launching unified action, developing it into a nationwide struggle, is the most important task at present, and it is also the most powerful force for smashing the enemy's suppression.

    日本民主青年同盟代表大会闭幕
    宣布不承认日美军事同盟条约
    宫本显治号召日本青年起来跟美日反动派坚决斗争
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本民主青年同盟第六次全国代表大会今天结束了三天的会议。大会通过决议宣布不承认新日美“安全条约”，并且呼吁世界各地青年为反对美帝国主义而进行共同斗争。
    大会通过的民主青年同盟当前的政策方针规定，反对新“安全条约”的斗争是民主青年同盟的重要任务。它指出，“青年同盟的成员应当在一切可以利用的场合，特别是在两千多个反对‘安全条约’的共同斗争组织中，揭露美帝国主义和日本垄断组织的反动政策”。
    大会还通过致日本全体青年呼吁书。呼吁书指出，日本人民和青年的责任是建立和平、独立、民主和中立的日本。呼吁书说，“只有通过为建立这样的日本而进行的斗争，我们才能开辟社会主义的光明前途”。
    大会讨论了扩大民主青年同盟组织的问题，大会决定在最近将来把同盟成员发展到三十万人。
    大会修改了民主青年同盟盟章，并且选出了新的领导机构。
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治26日在日本民主青年同盟举行的联欢会上呼吁日本青年为废除新“安全条约”和粉碎成立“第二个岸内阁”的阴谋而斗争。
    宫本说，社会主义国家的青年在国家的照顾下充满信心，正在向着共产主义社会迈进。只有在全世界变成社会主义和共产主义社会的时候，和平才能得到完全的保障。
    宫本说，在日本，美帝国主义和日本卖国垄断资本集团的统治阻碍日本走向这条光明大道。为了创造青年光明的未来和争取独立、和平与民主，日本所有的青年必须站起来挫败这两个敌人。他说，这是当前具有历史意义的任务。
    宫本说，目前美日反动派正在阴谋组织依靠日本军队和美帝国主义军事力量的“第二个岸内阁”。要粉碎这种阴谋和争取最后胜利，促使美军撤出日本、撤销美军基地是先决条件。
    宫本强调指出，由一切反岸力量来组织看守内阁，并且不懈地展开统一行动，使它发展成为全民性斗争，这是目前最重要的课题，同时这也是粉碎敌人镇压的最有力的力量。
