Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 4th. The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published a commentary on June 4th, titled "Growing Fraternal Friendship," regarding Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, Lezhi's, visit to China and his upcoming visits to North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia.

    The commentary stated that Chairman Lezhi's visit to China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia will further consolidate the ties between the Albanian people and the peoples of the fraternal Asian countries, and will further consolidate the unity of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic coast. The Albanian people welcome this friendly and peaceful visit with great joy.

    The commentary pointed out that the Albanian people express great admiration for the heroic liberation struggles waged by the Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian peoples against imperialist and colonial oppression, and sincerely congratulate the peoples of these countries on their victories.

    The commentary said that the Albanian people highly value the great role played by the great Chinese people in the struggle to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. No slanderous or despicable actions by U.S. imperialism and its supporters can negate this great reality. The Albanian people have always and will always firmly support the legitimate seat of the great Chinese people in the United Nations and the legitimate right to liberate Taiwan.

    The commentary said that the Albanian people value the rapid progress and brilliant achievements made by the great Chinese people on the road to building socialism. The Albanian people also value the victories achieved by the fraternal peoples of Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 5th. The Albanian "Unity" newspaper published an editorial on June 5th, titled "Warmly Expressing Albanian-Chinese Friendship." The editorial stated: The visit of Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, to China in recent days has warmly demonstrated the ever-flourishing and ever-strengthening eternal friendship between our people and the great Chinese people.

    The Chinese people's sincere feelings and heartfelt love in receiving and welcoming the envoys of our people once again demonstrate how close the friendship that links our two countries is.

    The editorial stated: Our people are proud of this precious friendship with the fraternal Chinese people. They understand that this friendship originates from the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

    We live on two different continents, separated by thousands of miles, but our common goals of struggle forever link us together. We are both members of the powerful socialist camp led by the great Soviet Union, and we follow a common goal: to build socialism, communism, and defend the great cause of peace.

    The editorial pointed out: Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the welcoming banquet for Lezhi: "Our unity is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is forever inseparable. For more than a decade, our two countries have always cooperated closely and supported each other in the common struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and in building socialism." The ties and fraternal cooperation between the peoples of China and Albania are growing and consolidating. Today, our people see the fruits of this friendship and cooperation in politics, economy, and culture. We have always followed with great interest the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in the socialist transformation of industrialization, and we are concerned to see the great progress of Chinese agriculture, and we have been and are drawing on her experience.

    Our friendship is clearly expressed in the struggle against our common enemies, the enemies of peace and socialism, the mad enemies of peace and the freedom of the people, U.S. imperialism, which has in the past and still attempts to sabotage the cause of peace with aggressive plans and attempts to obstruct the settlement of international issues through negotiations. The editorial continued: Our two parties, following the teachings of the great Lenin, have always adhered to the principled stand of Marxism-Leninism and the high principles of internationalism, and oppose the enemies of socialism and the modern revisionists of Yugoslavia, the agents of imperialism. The friendship and ties between the People's Republic of China, a great country with 650 million people, and Albania, a small country, is a characteristic of the relations between countries living in the socialist family. The strengthening of friendship and ties between the peoples of our two countries, and the iron-like unity between all countries of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, are the guarantee of the freedom and independence of our countries and the guarantee of ensuring peace.

    As active members of the socialist camp, the peoples of our two countries have always fully supported the Soviet Union's peace policy and strive to resolve international issues through negotiations. We will always stand united against the aggressive plans of U.S. imperialism and increase our vigilance, giving those provocateurs the response they deserve.

    Our people believe that the visit of Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, to China will be more conducive to further developing the friendship and cooperation between our two countries and will make a valuable contribution to consolidating peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸评列希主席访华的重大意义
    阿中两国并肩反对帝国主义和修正主义
    新华社地拉那4日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”4日就阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希访问中国和即将访问朝鲜、越南、蒙古三国，发表了题为“日益发展的兄弟友谊”的评论。
    评论说，列希主席对中国、朝鲜、越南和蒙古的访问，将进一步巩固阿尔巴尼亚人民和亚洲兄弟国家人民之间的联系，将进一步巩固以苏联为首的从太平洋到亚得里亚海岸边的强大的社会主义阵营的团结。阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着非常高兴的心情欢迎这个友好和平的访问。
    评论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民和蒙古人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义压迫所进行的英勇的解放斗争表示巨大的敬佩，并衷心祝贺这些国家的人民所取得的胜利。
    评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民非常重视伟大的中国人民在维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中所起的巨大作用。美帝国主义和它的支持者的任何诬蔑和卑鄙的行动都否定不了这一巨大的现实。阿尔巴尼亚人民过去和将来都永远和坚决地支持伟大的中国人民在联合国的合法席位和解放台湾的合法权利。
    评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民重视伟大的中国人民在建设社会主义道路上的突飞猛进和所取得的辉煌成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民也重视朝鲜、越南和蒙古等兄弟人民所取得的胜利。
    新华社地拉那5日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”5日发表了题为“热烈地表达了阿中友谊”的社论。社论说：阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希最近几天在中国的访问，热烈地表现了我国人民和伟大的中国人民之间的日益繁荣和日益加强的永恒友谊。
    中国人民以真挚的感情和衷心的热爱接待和欢迎我国人民的使者，再一次地说明了联结我们两国的友谊是多么地紧密。
    社论说：我国人民对兄弟的中国人民的这种珍贵的友谊感到自豪。他们了解，这种友谊是发源于不朽的马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义的。
    我们居住在两个不同的大陆上，彼此相隔千万里，但是，我们共同的斗争目标把我们永远地联结在一起。我们都是以伟大的苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的成员，我们遵循着共同的目标：建设社会主义、共产主义和保卫伟大的和平事业。
    社论指出：刘少奇主席在欢迎列希的宴会上说：“我们的团结是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础之上的，是永远不可分离的。十多年来，我们两国在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和建设社会主义的共同斗争中，始终紧密合作，相互支持。”阿中两国人民之间的联系和兄弟合作在日益增长和巩固，今天我国人民在政治和经济、文化等方面都看到了这种友谊和合作的成果。我们过去和现在都一直以巨大的兴趣关心着伟大的中国人民在工业化的社会主义改造中所获得的巨大成就，我们关心地看到中国农业的巨大进步，我们过去和现在都在汲取她的经验。
    我们的友谊清楚地表现在反对我们共同的敌人、和平和社会主义的敌人、反对和平和人民自由的疯狂敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，美帝国主义过去和现在都竭力企图以侵略计划来破坏和平事业和企图阻挠以谈判方式来解决国际问题。社论接着写道：遵循伟大列宁的学说的我们两国的党，过去和现在都永远坚持马克思列宁主义的原则性的立场和高度的国际主义原则，反对社会主义的敌人和帝国主义的代理人南斯拉夫现代修正主义者。拥有六亿五千万人口的大国——中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚这样一个小国的友谊和联系，是生活在社会主义大家庭当中的各国关系的一个特点，我们两国人民之间的友谊和联系的加强，和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营所有国家之间的钢铁般的团结，是我们各国人民自由独立的保证，是确保和平的保证。
    作为社会主义阵营的积极成员的我们两国人民，过去和现在都全力支持苏联的和平政策，争取通过谈判来解决国际问题。我们将永远团结在一起反对美帝国主义的侵略计划并日益加强警惕，给予那些挑衅者以应有的回答。
    我们人民相信，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希的访问中国，将更加有利于进一步发展我们两国之间的友谊和合作，并为巩固和平作出宝贵的贡献。
