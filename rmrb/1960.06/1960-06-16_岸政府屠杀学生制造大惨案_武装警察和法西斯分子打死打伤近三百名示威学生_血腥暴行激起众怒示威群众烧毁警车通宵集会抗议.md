Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 15th: News from Tokyo: During today's large-scale demonstration by the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in front of the Diet, the Nobusuke Kishi government ordered armed police and condoned fascist groups to attack the demonstrating masses, resulting in clashes and bloodshed. Two students were beaten to death, and nearly three hundred demonstrators were injured.

　　At 4:00 PM, ten thousand students from various locations braved the heavy rain to demonstrate towards the Diet. Near the south gate of the House of Representatives, they were blocked by thousands of police officers. Two students, male and female, died from police batons. The students then took self-defense actions, burning four police cars. The struggle continued into the late night.

　　Simultaneously, at 5:30 PM, fifty right-wing fascists in heavy trucks and small cars suddenly attacked the marching crowd demonstrating behind the Diet Building. The fascist thugs in the vehicles wielded large wooden clubs with nails to beat female students, women, artists, and ordinary residents in the procession. The demonstrators bravely defended themselves and counterattacked, dragging the thugs from the vehicles. They also surrounded a small truck used by the right-wing thugs and overturned it. The Japanese police "guarding" near the Diet turned a blind eye to the right-wing groups' violent attacks on the demonstrators, adopting a condoning attitude.

　　The fascist atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi government have ignited the flames of anger among the Japanese people even more fiercely.

　　Six thousand students immediately held a protest rally inside the south gate of the House of Representatives. At 9:20 PM, all attendees observed a moment of silence for their heroic comrades who sacrificed themselves and sang the Internationale together. The students shouted: Let us not allow our comrades to sacrifice their precious lives in vain, let us launch a thorough struggle. According to reports, Japanese university student organizations have announced that they will hold an all-night protest rally in front of the Diet.

　　Three thousand students who were holding a parade in Osaka City immediately held a protest rally after learning that their comrades had been beaten to death and injured by the police, and passed a resolution to launch a more powerful protest movement.

　　The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement today regarding the bloody incident in which police and fascists beat and injured demonstrators, severely condemning the fascist crimes of the Japanese police. The statement pointed out that the responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the police. The Socialist Party demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet take responsibility, and once again demanded that Kishi Nobusuke step down, dissolve the Diet, and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

    新华社15日讯　东京消息：今天在日本人民向国会展开反对日美军事同盟条约的大示威过程中，岸信介政府指令武装警察并纵容法西斯团体向示威群众进攻，结果发生了冲突和流血事件，有两名学生被打死和近三百名示威群众被打伤。
    下午四点钟，来自各地的一万名学生冒着倾盆大雨向国会进行示威。他们在众议院南便门附近遇到了数千名警察的阻击，有男女学生二人死在警棍下。学生们于是采取自卫行动，他们烧毁了四辆警车，这场斗争一直继续到深夜。
    同时，今天下午五时半，右翼法西斯分子五十人分乘重型卡车和小型汽车，向在国会大厦后面示威的游行队伍进行突然袭击。坐在车上的法西斯匪徒抡着带钉子的大木棍殴打游行队伍中的女学生、妇女、美术家和一般居民。示威群众勇敢地自卫和反击，把匪徒从车上揪下来。他们还把右翼匪徒搭乘的一辆小卡车包围起来，并且把卡车翻倒。在国会附近“戒备”的日本警察，对右翼团体向示威群众进攻的暴行，采取袖手旁观的纵容态度。
    岸信介政府的法西斯暴行使日本人民愤怒的火焰燃烧得更为炽烈。
    六千名学生立即在众议院南便门内举行了抗议集会。晚上九时二十分，全体人员为英勇牺牲的战友默祷，并且合唱国际歌。学生们高呼：不要让伙伴白白地牺牲珍贵的生命，让我们展开彻底的斗争。据报道，日本大学生组织已经宣布，他们要通宵在国会前进行抗议集会。
    正在大阪市内举行游行示威的三千名学生，在得悉他们的战友被警察打死和打伤的消息后，立即举行了抗议集会，并且通过决议要发动更强有力的抗议运动。
    日本社会党今天就警察和法西斯分子打死打伤示威群众的流血事件发表声明，严厉地谴责了日本警察的法西斯罪行。声明指出，这次事件的责任全部在警察方面。社会党要求岸信介内阁承担责任，并且再次要求岸信介下台、解散国会和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
