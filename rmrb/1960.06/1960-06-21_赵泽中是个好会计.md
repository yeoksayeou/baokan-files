    Zhao Zezhong is a Good Accountant
    Zhao Zezhong is the son of a poor peasant who only graduated from elementary school last year.

    Since becoming the canteen accountant for the Dazhulin team of the Happiness Production Brigade in our commune this spring, in addition to handling the canteen's accounts and the commune members' work points clearly, he also regularly participates in labor with the commune members. Recently, in order to free up more people for rice planting, he also voluntarily worked as a cook, personally delivering breakfast and lunch to the fields every day.

    In the recent canteen accountant competition in our entire commune, Zhao Zezhong was named a canteen accountant model for the entire commune.

    赵泽中是个好会计
    赵泽中是个去年才小学毕业的贫农家的儿子。
    自今年春天担任我们公社幸福生产队大竹林小队食堂会计以来，他除了把食堂的账目和社员的工分，处理得清清楚楚以外，还经常同社员一起参加劳动。最近为了抽出更多的人去插秧，他还主动地兼作炊事员工作，每天亲自把早饭、中饭送到田里去。
    最近在我们全公社食堂会计评比中，赵泽中被评为全社食堂会计标兵。
