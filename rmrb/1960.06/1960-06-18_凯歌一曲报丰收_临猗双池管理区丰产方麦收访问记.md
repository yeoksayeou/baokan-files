A Song of Triumph Reports the Bumper Harvest
    ——A Visit to the Abundant Wheat Harvest in Shuangchi Management Area, Linyi
    By Our Correspondents Sha Yin and Yang Yi

    Here is the wheat high-yield plot in Shuangchi Management Area, Beixin Commune, Linyi County, Shanxi. The ripe wheat is like a golden ocean. On the day the harvest began, the square field was bustling. More than thirty combine harvesters, rocking-back harvesters, and Tai Gu-brand horse-drawn harvesters shuttled back and forth. A harvesting army of more than two thousand people was immersed in the vast sea of wheat. Dust billowed on the roads as convoys of rubber-wheeled carts and ox carts passed by in groups. It was truly a magnificent scene of a bumper harvest!
    "Everyone's Contribution"
    "This is everyone's contribution!" Li Baocang, director of the square field management committee, stood in the wheat stalks, which were as tall as his chest, beaming from ear to ear. He pointed to the figures moving in the wheat sea and said, "Workers, students, cadres... they were involved in building the high-yield plot, they were involved in sowing, they were involved in fighting drought, they were involved in pest control, and now they are harvesting with us...."

    In the northeast corner of the command post, more than eighty workers from the commune's "August 1st" United Processing Plant were competing head-to-head with the members of the Shuangchi Management Area. Last fall, the workers competed with the commune members to build this high-yield plot. When the wheat was jointing, red spiders appeared. The workers rushed into battle again and treated five hundred mu of wheat fields infested with pests in one go. How could the workers who personally cultivated the high-yield plot not be excited in the face of such a great harvest?

    While the workers and commune members were competing, the students had already cut down several hundred mu of wheat to the east of the command platform. These students had worked with the commune members to cultivate this wheat in the struggles to build the high-yield plot, control pests, prevent frost, and combat drought. Now, they are harvesting with the commune members again.

    Bicycles with small red flags were parked by the roadside, with cabinets loaded on the back. This was the team of commercial workers. Their contribution should also be recorded in this high-yield wheat field: the commune members work, they work; the commune members rest, they become salespeople. One salesperson, Wang Shuyun, is just twenty years old. Last year, when the large-scale construction of the high-yield plot was underway, she also worked in the fields with the commune members. When the commune members' tilling tools broke down and could not be repaired due to a lack of parts, she rushed back to the village overnight and made a batch of small parts, which she delivered to the commune members early the next morning. If someone's clothes got dirty, she would wash them for the commune members. On the day the high-yield wheat harvest began, she rushed to the high-yield plot from Taotang Village, eight li away, before dawn. She entered the square field, put down her mobile vending box, and joined the ranks of wheat harvesters.
    Thanks to the Great Agricultural Revolution
    Wang Yunhu, the party branch secretary of the square field, participated in the competition with the commune members of Shuangchi Village. He is truly a master, the neat rows of wheat falling before his sickle. He took the lead, leaving the girls of the youth shock brigade far behind.

    Wang Yunhu personally opened up the high-yield plot and personally sowed the seeds. For a year, he has nurtured the wheat in the high-yield plot like a loving mother. He worried about every disaster that befell the wheat, and he was happy every time the wheat overcame difficulties. As the harvest approached, he was afraid that the wheat would be damaged during the harvest, so he checked all the preparations and couldn't sleep well for days. He had so much to say about the bumper wheat harvest in this high-yield plot. However, when people asked him about it, he dryly said, "Thanks to the Great Agricultural Revolution!" On the second night of the harvest, Yunhu, Li Shengzi, and their group held a forum while the commune members were holding a celebration of the bumper harvest, specifically discussing the experiences of this year's great wheat harvest in the high-yield plot.

    Various speeches explained the role of the Great Agricultural Revolution from different angles. Old man Li Shengzi is almost seventy years old this year. When he is mentioned in Shuangchi, everyone says he is a good hand at planting wheat. Even he could not help but shout, "Ah! Look at these ears! What dynasty has ever seen this? It really is a high-yield plot!" Li Shengzi's past views were not like this. When the management area was building the high-yield plot, he snorted and said:

   “That’s just a blind man lighting a lamp, burning oil for nothing!” Once the high-yield plot was built, the old man's views began to change. Before the wheat harvest, the square field command asked him to join the yield measurement team. He looked at each square and became happier and happier. At that time, some people in the yield measurement team said it could yield 400 jin, and some said it would yield at least 450 jin. Only old man Li Shengzi couldn't make up his mind. He and some old friends said, "This wheat yield is hard to estimate, we have never seen such good wheat!" At the forum, he said like he was telling a story, "This high-yield plot is really strong. In the past, when the water came down from the slope, it either washed away the manure or flooded the crops. It's different with the high-yield plot. Thousands of mu of land have been leveled and more than seventy field ridges have been built. When the flood comes down, nothing is lost. Furthermore, planting "lou soil" is not easy. The old people all say that you don’t dare plant ten mu of lou without a strong ox. Planting lou soil is too labor-intensive, people and livestock can’t handle it. This year is different. There are no more interspersed plots, far land has been changed to near land, small plots have been changed to large plots, people and livestock suffer less, run less, and work more. A laborer can always do a third more work this year than in the past. The wheat in the high-yield plot this year has been harrowed, milled, and hoed twenty-nine times, and the topsoil is always so good. In the past, the weeds in the field would even give the wheat seedlings shade. This year, no matter where you run in the entire square, you can rarely find a single weed..." Xie Jiwa, a member of the third production team, interrupted Li Shengzi before he could finish: "And the fertilizer, that's a big deal! In the past, our land was called 'hygienic land' because it was far away and we couldn't apply fertilizer. This year's wheat, just the base fertilizer, was more than 9,000 jin per mu, and we also applied top dressing six times. This wheat is like livestock, well-fed and watered, how can it not gain weight!" Xie Chuangye, the party branch secretary of the Shuangchi Management Area, praised the complete elimination of third-class land in the high-yield plot. In the past, because of this third-class land, he always carried the red flag and sent it to others every time there was a competition. This year, that didn't happen. He said: "Growing crops requires neatness. In the past, the third-class land ruined people. This year, the square field command came up with 'five unifications', and the wheat grows as evenly as water, it's the same everywhere you go!"
    Li Shengxiang, the first secretary of the commune party committee who participated in the forum, said that this year's harvest can be considered a great harvest. The wheat has had a bumper harvest, the experiences have had a bumper harvest, and everyone's thinking has also had a bumper harvest.

    凯歌一曲报丰收
    ——临猗双池管理区丰产方麦收访问记
    本报记者　莎荫　杨义
    这里是山西临猗县北辛公社双池管理区的小麦丰产方；熟透了的小麦，像金黄色的海洋。开镰收割的那天，方田里沸腾起来。三十多台联合收割机、摇背收割机和太谷号马拉收割机来往穿梭、两千多人组成的抢收大军，淹没在浩瀚的麦海里。道路上烟尘滚滚，拉麦的胶轮大车、牛车，成群结队地过往着。真是一片大好的丰收景象！
    “大家的功劳”
    “这是大家的功劳啊！”方田管理委员会的主任李保仓站在齐胸脯的麦丛里，乐得合不上嘴。他指着闪动在麦海里的人影说：“工人、学生、干部……，建丰产方有他们，播种有他们，抗旱有他们，治虫也有他们，现在，他们又和我们一道收割啦……。”
    在指挥部的东北角，有公社八一联合加工厂的八十多名工人，正和双池管理区的社员们兵对兵、将对将地竞赛着。去年秋天，工人们为建设这片丰产方，曾和社员们竞赛过。小麦拔节的时候，发生了红蜘蛛。工人们又跑马上阵，一口气治了五百亩麦地虫害。亲手培育了丰产方的工人们，在大丰收面前怎么能不使他们激动呢？
    在工人和社员们比赛的时候，指挥台正东面的几百亩麦子已经被学生们割倒了。这些学生曾经和社员们一道，在建丰产方、治虫、防冻和抗旱斗争中，培育了这块小麦。现在，他们又和社员一起来收割。
    路旁停放着插着小红旗的自行车，车子后边载着一个橱柜，这是商业工作者的队伍。在这块小麦丰产方里，也应该记载着他们的功劳：社员劳动，他们劳动；社员休息，他们就当售货员。有个售货员王淑云，刚满二十岁。去年，在大建丰产方的时候，她也跟着社员在地里一起劳动，社员的整地工具坏了，因为没配件不能修，她连夜赶回村，做了一批小配件，第二天一早送到社员手里；有人的衣服脏了，她就替社员洗。丰产方小麦开镰收割那天，天不明，她就从八里外的陶唐村赶到了丰产方。进了方田，放下流动售货箱，就参加到割麦的行列里去了。
        多亏农田大革命
    方田党支部书记王运虎，参加了双池村社员们的竞赛。他真算得一把好手，整整齐齐的麦子，顺着他的镰刀躺下去。他一马当先，把青年突击队的姑娘们丢得老远。
    王运虎亲手开辟了丰产方，又亲手撒下了种子。一年来，他就像一个慈祥的母亲那样，抚育着丰产方的小麦成长。他为小麦的每一次灾难而耽心，也为小麦每一次度过难关而高兴。临近收割的时候，他害怕小麦在收割中受到损失，把各项准备工作都检查到，一连好几天睡不上个好觉。他对这丰产方的小麦丰收有多少话要说，然而，当人们问起他的时候，他却干巴巴地说：“多亏农田大革命呵！”开镰收割的第二天晚上，运虎、李胜子他们一伙人，趁社员们开庆丰收晚会的时候，开了一个座谈会，专门扯今年丰产方小麦大丰收的经验。
    各式各样的发言，从不同角度上说明农田大革命的作用。李胜子老汉今年快七十岁了，在双池这地方提起来，谁不说他是把种麦的好手。就连他，也情不自禁地喊起来：“啊呀！看看这穗头儿，什么朝代见过？到底是丰产方?！”李胜子过去的看法可不是这样。当管理区建设丰产方的时候，他哼着鼻子说：
  “那才是瞎子点灯，白熬油！”丰产方一建成，老汉的看法就开始改变了。麦收前，方田指挥部请他参加测产小组，他一方一方看，越看越高兴。当时测产组的人有的说可以打四百斤，有的说最少也收四百五十斤。只有李胜子老汉决定不下，他和几个老朋友说，“这麦的产量不好估呵，咱没见过这么好的麦子哩！”在座谈会上，他像讲故事一样地说：“这丰产方呵，可真够劲。往年坡上水一下来，不是洗刷了粪土，就是漫了庄稼，有了丰产方就不同了，几千亩地，修得平平整整，打了七十多条地埂，洪水下来，一点都没跑。再说，种“塿土”地可不简单。老人们都说，没有一条大犍牛，不敢种十亩塿。种塿地太费工，人、牲口都顾不过来。今年可就不一样，插花地没有了，远地调成近地了，小块变成大块了，人、牲口少受罪，少跑路，多干活。一个劳力今年总能比往年多三分之一的活儿。今年丰产方的麦子，前后耙、磨、锄了二十九遍，墒土总是那么好。往年，地里的草还给麦苗打伞哩，今年任你跑遍全方，很少能找到一株草……”第三生产队的社员谢吉娃，没等李胜子说完就把话头接过去了：“还有肥料，这也是一件大事哩！往年，咱这地叫“卫生地”，地远又施不上肥。今年的麦子，光底肥，一亩就上了九千多斤，追肥还上了六次，这麦子就像牲口一样，吃饱喝到，那怕他不上膘！”双池管理区的党支部书记谢创业对丰产方彻底消灭三类田赞口不绝。往年，因为这三类田，每次评比，他都扛上红旗给别人送。今年可没这事，他说：“种庄稼，讲究整齐，过去三类田就把人坑坏了，今年方田指挥部来了个“五统一”，麦子长得像水一样平，走到那里都一样！”
    参加座谈会的公社党委第一书记李升祥说，今年这丰收，可算是大丰收，小麦丰收了，经验丰收了，大家的思想也丰收了。
