Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 27th. Brigadier General Aung Gyi, the Burmese Chief Representative attending the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee Meeting and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 26th to entertain the Chinese delegation, headed by Yao Zhongming, attending the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee Meeting.

    In his speech at the banquet, General Aung Gyi said that due to the adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by China and Burma, the friendship between the two countries has greatly developed.

    General Aung Gyi said that the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, which has not been resolved for a century, has now entered the final stage of resolution.

    General Aung Gyi wished Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai good health.

    Yao Zhongming, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation attending the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, expressed his gratitude to General Aung Gyi for the warm reception given to the Chinese delegation in his reply. He said that since the Prime Ministers of China and Burma initiated and announced the world-famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954, the friendship between the two countries has developed significantly. Especially since Premier Zhou Enlai of China and then-Burmese General Ne Win signed the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression this January, relations between the two countries have entered a new stage.

    Yao Zhongming expressed his firm belief that through friendly cooperation between the two sides, the Sino-Burmese boundary issue will be satisfactorily resolved.

    Yao Zhongming wished Burmese President U Win Maung, Prime Minister U Nu, and General Ne Win good health.

    The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The guests frequently toasted to the further development of Sino-Burmese friendship and the complete resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue.
