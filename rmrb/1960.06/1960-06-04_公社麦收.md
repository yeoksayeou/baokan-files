    Commune Wheat Harvest
    Wu Dayu, Xiangxue People's Commune, Kai County, Sichuan

    Opening Song of the Harvest
    The south wind blows, the wheat turns yellow,
    A golden hue dyes the hills.
    The commune mobilizes assault teams,
    Red banners wave for ten miles.
    Cartloads of wheat sheaves reach the threshing ground,
    Sickles dance, flashing silver light.
    Songs rise where golden waves roll,
    A bountiful harvest warms hearts.

    On the Threshing Ground
    The commune threshing ground,
    Wheat stacks topping the sun,
    Grandma sits by the edge watching the ground,
    Grandchildren play hide-and-seek down the mountain.
    Wheat mountains one after another,
    Delighting young and old in the whole family;
    Grandma pulls her grandchild close to chat,
    The grandchild cleverly speaks of fragrant steamed buns.

    Directing in the Field
    Wheat ears rustle like ringing bells,
    The Party Secretary harvests wheat without bending,
    Only manages a corner after a long time,
    Anxious sweat pours all over him.
    Commune members come to help in droves,
    Eagerly discussing the rich harvest with high laughter,
    Girls complain their sickles are not durable,
    Young men shout to change for new blades!

    Transporting Wheat
    Hooves fly, stirring up dust,
    Carts form lines on the village road,
    Head connected to the wheat field, tail aligned with the dam,
    Golden mountains loaded on the carts!
    Before a "Harvest Song" is finished,
    Ten thousand golden mountains are unloaded onto the threshing ground!
    The elated Captain shouts loudly:
    "Quickly build new granaries!"

    Rainy Night
    Thunder rolls, spring rain falls rapidly,
    A sea of lights boils, a dense crowd of people.
    The storm is about to snatch away the grain;
    Commune members won't allow a single grain to be lost!
    Silver sickles fall, songs rise,
    Harvesters rejoice in the rain,
    Buffaloes wield whips to plow the fields,
    Thousands of acres of green seedlings are planted in the fields.

    Weaving Mats
    The rich fragrance of wheat wafts through the courtyard gate,
    Joy arises in the Home of Respect for the Elderly,
    Grandpas and grandmas' faces are filled with smiles,
    In the courtyard, weaving mats without stopping.
    The woven mats stretch forward section by section,
    The commune's wheat stacks touch the clouds,
    Happy songs come to mind, smiles spread across faces,
    The harvest keeps the mat weavers busy!

    公社麦收
    四川开县向穴人民公社　吴大宇
    开镰曲
    南风吹，麦子黄，
    一片金色染山岗，
    公社出动突击队，
    火红战旗十里扬。
    车车麦把上晒场，
    镰刀飞舞闪银光，
    歌声起处金波滚，
    丰收暖进人心房。
    晒麦场上
    公社晒麦场，
    麦堆顶太阳，
    奶奶看场场边坐，
    孙孙山下捉迷藏。
    麦山一座连一座，
    喜煞老小一满堂；
    奶拉孙孙来谈心，
    孙孙巧说馍馍香。
    指挥田中
    麦穗沙沙似铃摇，
    书记割麦不弯腰，
    半天才收一个角，
    急得热汗遍身浇。
    社员纷纷来助战，
    争谈丰收笑语高，
    姑娘吵镰不耐用，
    小伙嚷着换新刀！
    运麦
    牲蹄飞翻尘土扬，
    村道上面车成行，
    头接麦田尾齐坝，
    金山车上装！
    一曲“丰收谣”没唱完，
    万座金山卸晒场！
    乐得队长大声嚷：
    “快快修新仓！”
    雨夜
    雷声紧，春雨急，
    灯海沸腾人马密。
    暴风雨要抢走粮；
    社员不许争穗粒！
    银镰落，歌声起，
    抢收人儿喜喜雨，
    ?牛挥鞭把田犁，
    千顷绿秧插田里。
    编围席
    浓郁麦香扑院门，
    敬老院中喜气生，
    爷爷婆婆脸堆笑，
    院坝编席手不停。
    围席节节朝前伸，
    公社麦囤顶云层，
    喜歌上口嘴角流，
    丰收忙坏编席人！
