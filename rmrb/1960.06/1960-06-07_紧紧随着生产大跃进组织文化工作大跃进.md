    Closely Following the Production Great Leap Forward, Organize a Cultural Work Great Leap Forward
    Representative of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province: Zhang Huaiying
    Xiyang County is located in the Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi Province. The entire area is mountainous, with a population of 160,000. In the past two years, under the brilliant light of the General Line for Socialist Construction, all aspects of work in Xiyang County have greatly developed. In 1959, the county's grain output increased by two times compared to before liberation. Mass cultural work, based on the popularization of ten activities such as singing, creation, and exhibitions in 1957, has now entered a new stage of widespread popularization and general improvement. Therefore, people call Xiyang "the land of abundant harvest and the home of art."

    I

    In 1958, after the people's communes were established throughout the county, we, based on the characteristics of the people's communes as "large in size and collective in nature" and "both organizers of production and organizers of the people's lives," first changed the past two-level mass cultural organizations of the county and advanced cooperatives to a four-level system of county, commune, management district, and production team. Fifteen communes have established cultural centers, exhibition halls, libraries, mass amateur art schools, amateur cultural work troupes, literary federations, cultural relics protection committees, and book sales agencies. Three hundred and eighty-eight management districts, county-run factories and mines, reservoir construction sites, etc., have established six offices, one troupe, and one school (namely, exhibition room, library, creation and research room, art research room, science research room, reference room, amateur theater troupe or cultural work troupe, and amateur art school) centered on the club. One thousand one hundred and thirty-nine production teams, workshops, and militia battalion headquarters have established one department and four groups (namely, cafeteria club, propaganda group, art group, creation group, and art group). Organizations at all levels have their own division of labor and are interconnected, closely coordinated, and complementary to each other.

    The cultural institutions at the commune level adhere to the principle of amateurism, and under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, they cooperate with political and production movements to hold larger-scale literary and artistic activities, reflect major changes in the entire commune, and at the same time guide the literary and artistic work of the management districts. The cultural institutions of the management districts, factories, mines, and reservoirs carry out centralized and comprehensive activities during festivals and holidays to meet the cultural and artistic requirements of the workers and peasants in their units. The cultural institutions of production teams and workshops mainly carry out literary and artistic activities that reflect the production and life of their units to meet the frequent cultural and entertainment needs of the masses.

    II

    Facts have proved that widely开展 (develop) and further improving mass creative activities is an important method to meet the growing cultural needs of the masses and reflect real life. The masses in Anyangou said, "It's better to sing yourself than to listen to others sing, it's better to sing about the collective than to sing about individuals, it's better to create while singing, and it's better for everyone to create than just a few people." However, some people believe that "peasants are always peasants, and there is a limit to how much they can improve. Anyway, you can't draw a Qi Baishi or sing a Niu Guiying in the countryside." (Niu Guiying is a Shanxi Zhonglu Bangzi opera actress) In response to this idea, we timely summarized and promoted the experience of Gao Maohai and others, who went from being illiterate to becoming amateur peasant artists. We adopted a method that combines promoting the backbone with the masses, using the backbone to lead the masses, organizing mass creation activities, and focusing on cultivating the backbone to carry out mass cultural work. At the same time, we educated the broad masses of cadres to make them realize that the workers and peasants are the creators of culture, which greatly encouraged the masses. At present, more than 80,000 workers and peasants in the county have participated in literary and artistic creation activities. The masses create while carrying out commentary work, so their improvement is very rapid.

    The masses also combined the transformation of old art with the creation of new art with local characteristics, according to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new from the old." For example, the Cheng Guan Commune cultural work troupe adapted the folk dance "Lahua" into "Busy in Four Seasons"; the masses in Beiguan changed the folk solo singing "Lotus Music" into a new type of dance program. The development of this mass creation activity has greatly enriched the cultural life of the masses. In the past two years, a total of 500,000 literary and artistic works of various kinds have been created, including 25 novellas, 320 operas, and more than 15,000 songs, poems, etc.; 1,250 new types of artistic programs have also been discovered, sorted out, and created; and new examples of grandfathers writing songs and grandsons composing music, and wives cutting paper-cuts and husbands writing lyrics have emerged. Therefore, the masses happily said: "In the past, we used to talk about catchy rhymes, rehearse foreign dances, sing about things in our own village, and use foreign music; now, we compose and perform small operas, compose our own new music, comment on new works, and write many books."

    III

    In order to carry out socialist and communist ideological education among the broad masses and meet their cultural needs, the slogan "Political One-Line, Ten Thousand Lights" was put forward. Encouraged by this slogan, the county has widely praised and defended the "Three Great萬歲 (Long Live)" through more than 40 activities such as exhibitions, slides, and "Red, Diligent, and Skillful Days" in the past two years. Before carrying out the nationwide socialist education movement in the winter of 1959, various literary and artistic activities were aimed at educating the anti-socialist ideas of a small number of wealthy middle peasants. Exhibition halls and exhibition rooms held exhibitions of "Three Generations Comparing One Prospect" (i.e., education on the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, the cruel plundering of the Japanese puppets, today's happy life, and future prospects); slide projection teams organized the projection of slides comparing the political and economic conditions of the village, household, and individual over three generations, and the infinitely bright future; during "Red, Diligent, and Skillful Days," the broad masses were organized to think about the past, compare the present, and look forward to the future through lectures and performances; libraries organized the broad masses to read the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Eighth Plenary Session, and books such as Liu Jiemei's repentance; and singing teams organized the broad masses to learn songs praising the "Three Great Long Live." In short, exhibitions are held in every village, slides are shown in every kang (platform bed), books follow production, people sit down and talk during "Red, Diligent, and Skillful Days," and songs and dances shake the mountains. In this way, young people working in the fields, old ladies watching babies on the kang, patients lying in bed, and shepherds running on the mountains can all receive socialist education. Zhao Jingui, a wealthy middle peasant in West Main Street, said to people in June last year, "If it weren't for this society (referring to the present), I would have bought a manor and land long ago, and hired long-term workers to lend money at interest." After seeing the exhibition in the street's exhibition hall showing the tragic scene of 19 wealthy middle peasant households before 1936, and 12 households declining into poor peasants and lower-middle peasants by 1945, 5 households remaining the same, and only 2 households rising to become rich peasants, he said to people, "Many people in the old society were very capable, but they still collapsed, let alone us? If it weren't for the new society, we wouldn't even be able to keep our capital." Wang Lazhou, a poor peasant in Xiasile Management District who forgot his roots, said, "In the past, money could buy ghosts to climb trees, but now money is useless." After reading the booklet "Liu Jiemei Forgets His Roots and Repents," and seeing his own family background in the exhibitions and slides: three generations of grandparents begging for food, four people starving to death in three years, two funerals in ten days, and comparing it with the current situation of having complete sets of bedding, surplus grain at home, and money in the bank, his conscience was condemned, his class consciousness was raised, and he was determined to follow the Party to build a new society. Lai Chengnu said in 1959, "The present is not as good as the past." After his mother saw the exhibition comparing the situation of three generations in the exhibition hall, she was greatly moved and went home to take out nine certificates (certificates of pawning clothes, selling houses, and selling people during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, and certificates of good people and paying taxes during the Japanese puppet regime; and the current certificates of commune members, voters, marriage certificates, and graduation certificates). After Lai Chengnu saw them, he cried bitterly and said, "I am truly unaware of my blessings." Therefore, he asked his mother to keep the "Nine Certificates" so that he could constantly spur himself and educate future generations.

    In order to vigorously cooperate with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we timely set up scientific and technological research rooms in various clubs, so that the technical revolution and the cultural revolution were organically combined, which powerfully cooperated with the movements of vigorously developing high-yield methods, tool reform, pig raising, spare-time education for workers and peasants, and the nationwide study of Mao Zedong's works. For example, after the county Party committee announced the decision to raise two pigs per household, cultural organizations at all levels immediately launched a widespread propaganda movement. Various places universally selected pig-raising pacesetters over the years through "Red, Diligent, and Skillful Days," used exhibitions to explain the ten major benefits of raising pigs, showed slides of advanced pig-raising techniques and pig-raising common sense, the library organized the broad masses to read books on pig-raising knowledge, the singing team compiled and sang songs such as "Black Treasure," and the theater troupe performed dramas such as "Pig-Raising Girl," so that pig-raising knowledge and technology quickly spread throughout the county, the county Party committee's decision was quickly grasped by the masses, and greatly promoted the development of pig-raising. After the commune members of Xiasile Management District learned about the benefits of raising pigs from slides, exhibitions, dramas, etc., they suddenly developed more than 500 pigs. Slide projection expert Li Fangmei also increased a lot of knowledge and mastered pig-raising techniques during the projection process, so that each of his three sows had more than sixteen litters in three litters. There was also a gratifying phenomenon in the district that no swine fever or deaths had occurred for nine months. Another example is that the Hongshui Management District Club compiled and drew slides of the deeds of farmer Liu Xiliang's power mill, which can improve work efficiency by fifty times, and also compiled and performed a small opera "Flywheel Rolling People's Hearts" to promote advanced experience, praise the advanced, and promote the development of the tool reform movement. Due to the widespread dissemination of advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge, in the first four months of this year, the county created and invented nearly 160,000 various tools, of which 68,000 have been universally promoted throughout the county.

    In the past two years, we have also cooperated with spare-time education work to carry out various cultural activities. We have merged the original club committee and the spare-time education committee into the cultural and educational committee, implementing one set of organizations and fighting on two fronts, so that cultural work and educational work are closely combined, which not only consolidates learning results, but also enlivens the mass cultural life. In the literacy campaign, the Xiasile Management District Club drew colorful alphabet cards and added hieroglyphic pictures for teaching; the library prepared more than 600 copies of books such as "Picture Phonetic Spelling" for the students; and the cafeterias and public places also arranged an environment for learning phonetic alphabets. Due to the active cooperation of various activities, they were able to complete the literacy task of 310 young and middle-aged illiterate people in a short period of twenty days.

    While publicizing the Party's various policies, disseminating scientific and technological knowledge, cooperating with the popularization of education, and promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, it has also greatly enlivened the cultural life of the broad masses. In the past four months of this year, the masses in the county have watched slides an average of thirteen times per person, learned twelve new songs, and 83,000 people have participated in reading books. The participation of the broad masses of workers and peasants in literary and artistic activities throughout the county has seen tremendous development and improvement in both quantity and quality, and the forms of cultural activities are diverse, which are more popular among the broad masses.

    IV

    Facts have proved that strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels over mass cultural work is the key to ensuring the continuous development and improvement of cultural work. Therefore, since the Great Leap Forward, we have used the methods of "five grasps" and "one net" to strengthen the leadership of cultural work.

    1. Grasp politics as the commander. Practice has proved that in order to implement the policy of literature and art serving politics, serving production, and serving education, it is necessary to repeatedly publicize to the masses and improve their ideological understanding with the development of the situation. During the Great Leap Forward, two erroneous tendencies emerged among some cadres and masses: one was that after the start of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some people advocated doing big things and focusing on professionalism, and looked down on small-scale and amateur cultural activities; the other was that in the spring of 1959, some cadres believed that "painting cannot paint steel" and "singing cannot sing grain," and the erroneous idea of not wanting mass cultural work was revived. After discovering these ideas, we immediately launched a movement to study Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts among the masses, greatly improving the political consciousness of the masses, overcoming the erroneous tendency of literature and art for the sake of literature and art, and correcting the position of cultural work. On this basis, in order to regularly carry out political and ideological education for the literary and artistic teams, we also continuously summarized the experience of local mass cultural work, organized visits, carried out realistic education, and adhered to the system of studying the Party's policies and guidelines in various periods, and holding life meetings. This has greatly improved the ideological level of the amateur literary and artistic teams. Now, more than 80% of the 34,000 backbones are ideologically advanced and actively involved in production, and 1,200 literary and artistic backbones have been rated as pacesetters on various fronts. This has powerfully guaranteed the continuous development and improvement of mass cultural work throughout the county.

    2. Grasp specific leadership. In the past few years, we have realized that in order to do a good job in mass cultural work, we must first strengthen the Party's specific leadership and put mass cultural work on the Party's agenda. Therefore, in addition to the first secretary taking the lead, the county Party committee also has a secretary in charge of this work. In addition to the first secretary taking the lead, the Party committees of the communes and the Party branches of the management districts also have a deputy secretary in charge of this work. Each production team must be equipped with a deputy captain specifically in charge of cultural work. The county Party committee and the Party committees of the communes also study and deploy mass cultural work when deploying and inspecting work each time; the county Party committee studies mass cultural work once a quarter, and the commune Party committees and the Party branches of the management districts study it once a month, and timely propose new topics and solve them. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels must not only become the organizers of mass cultural work, but also make every Party member and cadre an active participant in mass cultural activities, that is, every Party member and cadre must share weal and woe with the masses and enjoy labor and pleasure together. In addition, it is necessary to continuously rectify the cultural organizational structure so that it can timely adapt to the development and changes of production organizations. These have played a great role in the development and improvement of mass cultural work.

    3. Grasp the guidance of the cultural center. The cultural center is the main force in guiding mass literary and artistic activities. Therefore, doing a good job in guidance is of great significance to the development and improvement of mass cultural work. Therefore, we have adhered to regularly assigning tasks to the cultural center, regularly inspecting and summarizing work, and strengthening specific leadership. At the beginning of each political movement, we first organize the cultural center cadres to study and discuss to improve their thinking, and then cooperate with the movement and the center to go deep into key clubs, creating experience to guide the overall situation on the one hand, and learning from the masses and reality in the movement to exercise and improve their political and ideological level on the other hand. The cadres of the cultural center spend more than 70% of their time going deep into the countryside, factories and mines, guiding and improving at the same time. In addition, in order to ensure the continuous improvement of cultural center cadres, so as to better strengthen the work of the cultural center, we do not arbitrarily transfer cultural center cadres. Now, there are a total of sixteen people in the county cultural center, seven of whom have worked in the cultural center for more than ten years, and only three for less than five years.

    4. Grasp large-scale collaboration. In the past two years, we have implemented the methods of "one unity," "three continuous links," and "five linkages." The so-called "one unity" is that under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, various departments cooperate with each other around the center. The so-called "three continuous links" are: (1) The professional and amateur are linked continuously, the professional guides the amateur; the amateur provides creative materials for the professional; (2) The cultural department and other relevant departments are linked continuously, the cultural department also does other work when going to the countryside, and other departments also do cultural work when going to the countryside; (3) The upper and lower levels are linked continuously. The upper level disseminates knowledge and experience to the lower level, and the lower level provides information and materials to the upper level. The "five linkages" are: (1) Movies and slides are linked, showing slides while showing movies; (2) Bookstores and libraries are linked, actively supplying books to libraries; (3) The Literary Federation and the creation room are linked, actively recommending successful works to the creation room; (4) The cultural work troupe (or theater troupe) and the art school are linked, regularly training talents for the art school in rotation; (5) The exhibition hall and the museum are linked, actively providing valuable historical materials for the museum. The "three continuous links" and "five linkages" have powerfully promoted the work in various aspects.

    5. Grasp cultural activities thriftily. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have always paid attention to preventing the big少爷 (young master) style of talking about ostentation and extravagance, adhering to the principle of making the most of simple means, and carrying forward the fine tradition of diligence and frugality. For example, in the "Three Dynasties Comparing One Prospect" exhibition held throughout the county in the winter of 1959, many exhibits were painted by the masses themselves and made of old newspapers and white gypsum powder. More than 90% of the more than 600 slide projectors currently in the county are made by the masses themselves in their spare time. Some masses also use waste materials to make musical instruments such as huqin, pipe, and sheng themselves.

    6. Establish an art education network and cultivate a large number of literary and artistic talents among workers and peasants. According to the needs, we have universally established spare-time art schools in counties, management districts, factories and mines, and reservoir construction sites, and established art research groups in production teams, forming an art education network from top to bottom. The county spare-time art school specializes in training commune cultural cadres and art backbones in management districts, and cultivates teachers for communes and management districts. The commune spare-time art school regularly trains art backbones in management districts, focusing on improving their political and ideological awareness. The spare-time art schools in various management districts, factories and mines, and reservoir construction sites absorb the broad masses of workers and peasants to participate and learn basic cultural knowledge. The literary and artistic groups in production teams and workshops also conduct regular study. In addition, three major literary and artistic guidance forces were organized: a literary and artistic professional guidance team composed of full-time cultural cadres from the county and communes; a literary and artistic group guidance team composed of the county cultural work troupe and the Jin Opera Troupe; and an amateur guidance team composed of rural literary and artistic backbones and primary school teachers. Because we have given full play to the role of spare-time art schools and guidance networks at all levels, we have now cultivated more than 30,000 literary and artistic backbones, 5,000 of whom have certain performance abilities, and 4 amateur peasant artists such as Shi Zhangyuan and 800 literary and artistic activity experts have emerged.

    V

    Although our county's mass cultural work has achieved some achievements and experience after more than two years of continuous great leap forward, it is still far from meeting the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production and the growing cultural needs of the broad masses. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and give full play to the superiority of the people's commune to achieve a higher level of cultural popularization in the next three years. To this end, we must further strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and widely and deeply carry out the movement to study Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought to improve the ideological level of the literary and artistic team. Secondly, in leadership, we should pay attention to grasping weak links, grasping cutting edges, and grasping important links such as backbones. Again, we must strengthen guidance, organize reviews, carry out mass guidance work and literary and artistic reviews, and improve the literary and artistic literacy and performance ability of the broad masses and literary and artistic backbones. Under the principle of cooperating with production, we strive to create a new situation of greater prosperity in culture and art in all people's communes, management districts, and production teams in the county.

    紧紧随着生产大跃进组织文化工作大跃进
    山西省昔阳县代表　张怀英
    昔阳县位于山西省东部太行山上，全境是一片大山区，人口共有十六万。近两年来，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，昔阳县各方面的工作都有了很大的发展。1959年全县粮食产量比解放前提高两倍，群众文化工作在1957年普及歌唱、创作、展览等十项活动的基础上，现在也进入了大普及和普遍提高的新阶段。因此人们把昔阳称为“丰产之乡、艺术之家”。
    一
    1958年全县人民公社化后，我们根据人民公社“一大二公”、“既是生产组织者又是人民群众生活组织者”的特点。首先把过去的县和高级社的两级群众文化组织，改为县、公社、管理区、生产队四级。十五个公社都建立了文化馆、展览馆、图书馆、群众业余艺术学校、业余文工团、文联、文物保护委员会和图书代销店。三百八十八个管理区、县营厂矿、水库工地等，都以俱乐部为中心，建立了六室、一团、一校（即展览室、图书室、创作研究室、艺术研究室、科学研究室、资料室、业余剧团或文工团、业余艺术学校）。一千一百三十九个生产队、车间、民兵营部都建立了一部四组（即食堂俱乐部、宣传组、文艺组、创作组、美术组）。各级组织各有分工而又互相联系，紧密配合，相辅相成。
    公社一级的文化机构，坚持业余的原则，在公社党委的统一领导下，配合政治、生产运动，举办较大的文艺活动，反映全社的重大变化，同时指导管理区的文艺工作。各管理区、厂矿、水库的文化机构，在节日、假日进行集中的综合性的活动，满足本单位工、农群众的文化艺术要求。生产队、车间的文化机构，主要是进行反映本单位的生产和生活的文艺活动，满足群众经常的文化娱乐要求。
    二
    事实证明，广泛地开展并进一步提高群众性的创作活动，是满足广大群众日益增长的文化生活要求，反映现实生活的一个重要方法。安阳沟群众说：“听唱不如自唱，唱个人不如唱集体，只是唱不如带创作，少数人创作不如大家都创作。”但是也有一些人认为：“农民总是农民，再提高也有限。反正在农村画不出齐白石来，唱不出牛桂英来。”（牛桂英是山西中路梆子演员）针对这种思想，我们及时地总结和推广了高毛孩等由原来一字不识现在成为业余农民文艺家的经验，采取了以群众促骨干、以骨干带群众，组织群众性的创作活动和深入重点培养骨干相结合的办法，开展群众文化工作。同时教育广大干部，使他们认识到工农群众是文化的创造者，于是大大地鼓舞了群众。目前，全县已有八万多个工人农民参加了文艺创作活动。群众一边创作，一边开展评论工作，因而提高很快。
    群众还根据“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，把改造旧艺术和创造具有地方风格的新艺术结合起来。如城关公社文工团把民间舞蹈“拉话”，改编为“四季忙”；北关群众把民间的单人清唱“莲花乐”，改为新型的舞蹈节目。这种群众性创作活动的开展，大大丰富了群众的文化生活。两年来共创作了各种文艺作品五十万件，其中有中篇小说二十五篇，歌剧三百二十个，曲艺、歌曲、诗歌等一万五千多首；还发掘、整理、创造新型艺术节目一千二百五十个；出现了爷编歌孙配曲，妻剪纸夫配词的新事例。所以群众高兴地说：“过去是，说说顺口溜，排演外地舞，唱着本村事，配着外地谱；现在是，编演小歌剧，自配新曲谱，评论新作品，编写许多书。”
    三
    为了向广大群众进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，并满足他们的文化要求，提出了“政治一条龙，形式万盏灯”的口号。在这一口号的鼓舞下，全县两年来通过展览、幻灯、“红、勤、巧日”等四十多种活动，广泛地歌颂和捍卫了“三大万岁”。在1959年冬季开展全民社会主义教育运动前，各种文艺活动都针对少数富裕中农的反社会主义的思想进行教育。展览馆和展览室举办了“三代对比一展望”的展览（即蒋、阎黑暗统治，日伪残酷掠夺，如今的幸福生活和未来前景教育）；幻灯放映队组织放映了村、户、人三代政治经济对比和未来无限光明的幻灯片；在“红、勤、巧日”组织了广大群众想过去，比现在，望将来的讲座和表演；图书馆组织了广大群众阅读中共八届六中全会、八中全会的文件和刘介梅回头等图书；歌咏队组织广大群众学会了歌颂“三大万岁”的歌曲。总之，展览村村办，幻灯炕头演，图书跟生产，“红、勤、巧日”坐下谈，歌舞震山川。这样就使地头劳动的青年、炕头看娃娃的老太太、床上躺着的病人、山头跑着的羊工，人人都能够受到社会主义教育。西大街富裕中农赵金贵，在去年6月对人说：“要不是这社会（指现在），我早就置下庄窝买下地，用下长工放着利。”在看了本街展览馆展出1936年前有富裕中农十九户，到1945年有十二户下降为贫农、下中农，五户保持原状，只有两户上升为富农的悲惨景象后，他就对人说：“旧社会很多人很有本事，结果还垮了台，何况咱呢？要不是新社会，准保咱连老本也保不住。”下思乐管理区翻身忘本的贫农王拉周说：“过去有钱能买鬼上树，现在有钱不顶用。”他看了“刘介梅忘本回头”的小册子，又在展览、幻灯中看到自己的家底：祖孙三代讨过饭，三年饿死过四口人，十天遭到两次丧事，和现在被褥成套，家有余粮，银行里存钱的情形对照起来，良心受到责备，提高了阶级觉悟，下决心跟着党建设新社会。来成牛在1959年说：“现在不如过去好。”他母亲在展览馆里看到三代情况对比的展览后，大受感动，回家去拿出九张证（蒋、阎统治时期的当衣证、卖房证、卖人证，日伪时期的良民证、交税证；如今的社员证、选民证、结婚证、毕业证），来成牛看后，抱头大哭说：“真是身在福中不知福。”因此，他让母亲把“九证”保存下来，以便经常鞭策自己，并教育后代子孙。
    我们为了大力配合技术革新与技术革命运动，及时地在各个俱乐部设立了科学技术研究室，使技术革命与文化革命有机地结合起来，有力地配合了大搞丰产方、工具改革、养猪、工农业余教育、全民学习毛泽东著作等运动。例如县委宣布户养两头猪的决定后，各级文化组织都立即展开了广泛的宣传运动。各地通过“红、勤、巧日”普遍评选出历年的养猪标兵，用展览说明养猪的十大好处，放映了先进的养猪技术和养猪常识的幻灯片，图书馆组织广大群众阅读有关养猪知识的图书，歌咏队编唱了“黑财宝”等歌子，剧团排演了“养猪姑娘”等戏剧，使养猪的知识和技术很快传播到全县各地，县委的决定很快为群众所掌握，大大促进了养猪事业的发展。下思乐管理区的社员，从幻灯、展览、戏剧等当中知道了养猪的好处后，一下子就发展了五百多头猪。幻灯能手李方梅在放映过程中，自己也增加了许多知识，掌握了养猪技术，使三只母猪三次繁殖都在十六只以上。全区还出现了九个月没发生过猪瘟和死亡的可喜现象。又如洪水管理区俱乐部把农民刘喜良创造的能提高工作效率五十倍的动力磨的事迹，编绘出幻灯片，还编演了小歌剧“飞轮滚动人心”，向群众宣传，表扬了先进，促进了工具改革运动的发展。由于先进经验和科学技术知识的广泛传播，使得在今年的前四个月内，全县共创造、发明了各种工具近十六万件，其中有六万八千件已在全县普遍推广。
    近两年来，我们还配合业余教育工作，开展各项文化活动。我们已把原来的俱乐部委员会和业余教育委员会合并为文教委员会，实行一套组织，两线作战，使文化工作和教育工作紧密地结合起来，既巩固了学习成果，又活跃了群众文化生活。在扫盲运动中，下思乐管理区的俱乐部绘制了彩色的字母片，并配上象形图画进行教学；图书馆则给学员准备了六百多册“看图拼音”等图书；各个食堂和公共场所也布置了学习拼音字母的环境。由于各方面活动的积极配合，因而使他们能在短短的二十天的时间内，完成三百一十名青壮年文盲的扫盲任务。
    在宣传党的各项政策、传播科学技术知识，配合普及教育，推动工农业生产大跃进的同时，也大大活跃了广大群众的文化生活。今年四个月来，全县群众每人平均看幻灯十三次，学会新歌十二个，参加阅读图书的达八万三千人。全县广大工农群众参加文艺活动，不论数量质量都有巨大的发展和提高，文化活动的形式多种多样，因而更加受到广大群众的欢迎。
    四
    事实证明，加强各级党委对群众文化工作的领导，是保证文化工作不断发展和提高的关键。因此，大跃进以来，我们用“五抓”、“一网”的方法，加强了对文化工作的领导。
    一、抓政治挂帅。实践证明，贯彻文艺为政治、为生产、为教育服务的方针，必须随着形势的发展，反复地向群众进行宣传，提高他们的思想认识。大跃进中，在部分干部和群众中，曾产生了这样两种错误倾向：一种是在1958年大跃进开始后，一部分人主张搞大、搞专，看不起小型、业余的文化活动；一种是在1959年春天，一部分干部又认为“绘画画不出钢铁来”、“唱歌唱不出粮食来”，不要群众文化工作的错误思想又有复活。发现这些思想后，我们立即在群众中开展了学习毛主席文艺思想的运动，大大提高了群众的政治觉悟，克服了为文艺而文艺的错误倾向和摆正了文化工作的位置。在此基础上，为了经常对文艺队伍进行政治思想教育，还不断总结当地群众文化工作的经验，组织参观，进行现实教育，并坚持了学习党在各个时期的方针政策，召开生活会等制度。这样就大大提高了业余文艺队伍的思想水平。现在三万四千个骨干中，有80％以上是思想先进、生产积极的，并有一千二百个文艺骨干被评为各个战线上的标兵。从而有力地保证了全县群众文化工作的不断发展和提高。
    二、抓具体领导。几年来我们体会到，要搞好群众文化工作，必须首先加强党的具体领导，把群众文化工作放到党的议事日程上来。因此，县委除第一书记挂帅外，还有一个书记分工专管这项工作。各公社党委、管理区党支部除第一书记挂帅外，也都有一个副书记专管这项工作。每个生产队都要配备一个专管文化工作的副队长。县委、各公社党委，在每次布置和检查工作的时候，还研究和布置群众文化工作；县委每季、公社党委和管理区党支部每月研究一次群众文化工作，及时提出新课题，加以解决。同时，各级党组织不仅要成为群众文化工作的组织者，而且要使每个党员干部成为群众文化活动的积极参加者，即每个党员干部必须和群众同甘共苦，同劳共乐。此外，要不断整顿文化组织机构，使其及时地适应生产组织的发展变化。这些，对于群众文化工作的发展和提高，都起到了很大的作用。
    三、抓文化馆辅导。文化馆是辅导群众文艺活动的主要力量。因而作好辅导工作，对群众文化工作的发展和提高，具有十分重要的意义。因此，我们坚持了定期给文化馆布置任务，定期检查总结工作和加强具体领导。在每个政治运动开始，都首先组织文化馆干部学习讨论，提高他们的思想，然后配合运动和中心，深入重点俱乐部，一面创造经验，指导全面，一面在运动中，向群众向实际学习，锻炼和提高他们的政治思想水平。文化馆干部都用70％以上的时间深入农村、厂矿，边辅导边提高。此外为了保证文化馆干部的不断提高，从而更好地加强文化馆的工作，我们不随便调动文化馆干部。现在县文化馆共十六人，在文化馆工作十年以上的就有七人，五年以下的只有三人。
    四、抓大协作。两年来，我们贯彻了“一统一”、“三连环”、“五挂钩”的办法。所谓“一统一”，就是在各级党委的统一领导下，各部门围绕中心，互相协作。所谓“三连环”是：（一）专业与业余连环，专业辅导业余；业余为专业提供创作素材；（二）文化部门同其他有关部门连环，文化部门下乡也搞其它工作，其它部门下乡，也搞文化工作；（三）上级和下级连环。上级为下级传播知识和经验，下级为上级提供情况和材料。“五挂钩”是：（一）电影和幻灯挂钩，放映电影的同时放映幻灯；（二）书店和图书馆挂钩，主动供给图书馆书籍；（三）文联和创作室挂钩，主动向创作室推荐成功的作品；（四）文工团（或剧团）和艺校挂钩，定期为艺校轮训人材；（五）展览馆和博物馆挂钩，主动为博物馆提供有价值的历史资料。通过“三连环”、“五挂钩”有力地促进了各方面的工作。
    五、抓勤俭办文化。大跃进以来，我们经常注意防止讲排场、闹阔气的大少爷作风，坚持因陋就简的原则，发扬勤俭朴素的优良传统。如在1959年冬，全县举办的“三朝对比一展望”展览会，很多展品都是由群众自己配颜色，并利用旧报纸、白坩粉刷绘制成的。全县现有的六百多架幻灯机，90％以上都是群众利用业余时间自己制造的。有的群众还利用废料，自己制造出胡琴、管、笙等乐器。
    六、建立艺术教育网，大量培养工农群众的文艺人材。根据需要，我们在县、管理区、厂矿、水库工地，普遍建立起业余艺术学校，在生产队，建立艺术研究小组，自上而下形成了一个艺术教育网。县业余艺术学校专门训练公社文化干部和管理区的艺术骨干，为公社、管理区培养师资。公社业余艺术学校定期训练管理区文艺骨干，着重提高他们的政治思想觉悟水平。各管理区、厂矿、水库工地的业余艺术学校，吸收广大工农群众参加，学习文化基本知识。生产队、车间的文艺小组，也经常进行学习。此外，还组织了三支文艺辅导大军：县和公社的文化专职干部组成一支文艺专业辅导队；县文工团、晋剧团等组成一支文艺团体辅导队；农村文艺骨干和小学教师组成一支业余的辅导队。由于我们充分发挥了各级业余艺术学校和辅导网的作用，现在已培养出三万多名文艺骨干，其中有五千人具有一定的表演能力，并涌现出史掌元等四名业余农民文艺家和八百名文艺活动能手。
    五
    我县的群众文化工作，经过两年多连续大跃进，虽然取得了一些成绩与经验，但是与工农业生产的高速度发展，与广大群众日益增长的文化生活要求相比，还是远远不相适应的。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们要高举毛主席文艺思想的红旗，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，在今后三年内，实现更高水平的文化大普及。为此，我们要进一步加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，广泛深入地开展学习毛主席文艺思想运动，提高文艺队伍的思想水平。其次，在领导上要注意抓薄弱环节、抓尖端、抓骨干等重要环节。再次要加强辅导，组织评论，开展群众性的辅导工作和文艺评论，提高广大群众和文艺骨干的文艺素养和表演能力。在配合生产的原则下，我们争取在全县所有的人民公社、管理区、生产队都出现一个文化艺术更大繁荣的新局面。（附图片）
