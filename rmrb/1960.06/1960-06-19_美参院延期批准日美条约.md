Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 18th. The Japanese people's raging struggle against the US-Japan military treaty has caused great difficulties for the US ruling clique's conspiracy to impose this aggressive treaty on the Japanese people. The US Senate's meeting, originally scheduled to review this treaty, has been repeatedly postponed.

According to a report by a United Press International reporter yesterday, citing well-informed sources, after a series of fierce arguments between the State Department and Senate leaders, an agreement was reached late on the 16th to postpone the approval of the treaty until after the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan approves the US-Japan military treaty.

The US Senate originally planned to meet on the 16th to review and approve the US-Japan military treaty, in order to create a fait accompli and impose it on the Japanese people before Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. However, after the Japanese people's massive demonstrations forced the Kishi Nobusuke government to cancel Eisenhower's "visit," fierce disputes arose within the US ruling clique over the timing of approving the US-Japan military treaty. It is reported that Democratic Senator Humphrey and Republican Senator Case and others argued that before Japan ratifies the treaty, the Senate should seriously consider whether it is "appropriate" to approve it. Humphrey worried that the US approving the treaty first would become a new factor in prompting the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and that "if approval accelerates the collapse of the Japanese government, the treaty will be useless."

On the morning of the 16th, the US Senate convened two and a half hours earlier than usual to ensure sufficient time for debate. It is reported that this meeting, which began in a tense atmosphere, did not achieve any results.

Senate Majority Leader Johnson and others tried to conceal the embarrassing situation of the US ruling clique and tried their best to advocate early approval of the US-Japan military treaty. It is revealed that Johnson has requested the Senate to meet exceptionally on the 18th (Saturday) (according to convention, the US Senate generally does not meet on Saturdays).

However, fearing another failure and setback, the US Senate is said to be postponing the consideration of the approval of the US-Japan military treaty until next week. Senate Democratic (Majority) Deputy Leader Mansfield told a reporter who visited him yesterday that he guessed the Senate would deal with this issue on the 20th.

### 美参院延期批准日美条约

    美参院延期批准日美条约
    据新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：日本人民反对美日军事条约如火如荼的斗争，使美国统治集团企图把这一侵略条约强加到日本人民身上的阴谋遭到极大困难。美国参议院原定举行的审查这个条约的会议被迫一再延期。
    合众国际社记者昨天援引消息灵通人士报道，国务院同参议院领袖经过一番激烈的争论之后，在16日深夜达成协议，同意在日本岸信介政府批准美日军事条约之前，延期批准这个条约。
    美国参议院原来打算在16日开会审查和批准美日军事条约，以便在艾森豪威尔“访问”日本之前制造既成事实而强加到日本人民身上。但是，在日本人民声势浩大的示威斗争迫使岸信介政府不得不取消艾森豪威尔的“访问”之后，美国统治集团在批准美日军事条约的时机问题上发生了激烈的争论。据报道，民主党参议员汉弗莱和共和党参议员凯斯等人却主张，在日本批准这一条约之前，参议院应当认真考虑批准这个条约是否“适宜”。汉弗莱担心，美国首先批准这个条约会成为促使岸信介政府垮台的新因素，而“如果批准会加速日本政府的垮台，条约也就会毫无用处”。
    16日上午，美国参议院比往常规定的时间提早两个半小时举行会议，以便保证有充分的时间进行辩论。据悉，在紧张的气氛中开始的这次会议并没有取得什么结果。
    参议院多数派领袖约翰逊等人力图掩盖美国统治集团的狼狈处境，并且竭力鼓吹早日批准美日军事条约。据透露，约翰逊已经要求参议院破例在18日（星期六）开会（按照常规美国参议院一般不在星期六开会）。
    但是，由于担心再次遭到失败和碰壁，美国参议院据说要延期到下星期才能开会审议批准美日军事条约的问题。参议院民主党（多数派）副领袖曼斯菲尔德昨天告诉访问他的一个记者说，他猜想参议院会在20日处理这个问题。
