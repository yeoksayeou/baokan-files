Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch: A two-day signature campaign against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was held across Japan today and yesterday.

　　This signature campaign was initiated by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty," with the goal of collecting 27 million signatures against the "Security Treaty."

　　In Tokyo, signature activities were conducted in more than 100 locations. Young people from many groups spontaneously visited citizens door-to-door, asking families to write their names in the signature books against the "Security Treaty."

　　Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Yoshio Shiga, member of the Central Committee Executive Committee, and Yashiro Ii, member of the Central Committee, stood in front of Tokyo's three major stations to lead the signature collection, calling on pedestrians to sign against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that violates the interests of the Japanese nation and threatens Asian peace.

　　Since the Kishida Nobusuke group used fascist violence to unilaterally "pass" this treaty in the House of Representatives, the signature campaign against the "Security Treaty" has developed rapidly, and the number of signatures has increased significantly. It is particularly noteworthy that the signature campaign in rural areas is constantly developing. In a village in Nagano Prefecture, more than 80% of the villagers had signed petitions against the "Security Treaty" by the end of May.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese working class to hold a second general strike to force the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet to resign, dissolve the House of Representatives, and prevent Eisenhower from visiting Japan.

　　The editorial said that the Japanese Communist Party believes that the situation for holding a larger-scale second general strike is ripe. The editorial suggested that the date for the second general strike should be no later than June 15.

　　The editorial listed the various forms of support from the broad sections of the Japanese people for the June 4th general strike, illustrating that the conditions for holding a second general strike are ripe. The editorial pointed out that after the June 4th general strike, Kishida Nobusuke concealed his wavering and continued to adopt a high-pressure policy, and this situation requires the Japanese working class to take resolute action.

　　The editorial emphasized that if a second general strike, combined with the signature campaign against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, protest rallies, and protests against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, is held before June 15, it will definitely bring about a fundamental change in the current situation.

　　The editorial called on all Japanese workers to immediately begin preparations for a second general strike, and demanded that trade union leaders make persistent efforts to launch a second national strike.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a two-day national congress in Omuta City today. The congress will formulate a struggle policy in order to achieve a complete victory in the struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and in support of the Miike coal miners' strike.

　　A total of 2,000 trade union activists and invited guests attended the congress, including representatives from 57 member unions from all over the country and representatives from the Mitsui Coal Mine Workers' Union, which is currently on strike.

　　Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, and Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, both attended the congress.

　　After Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of "Sohyo," presented the policy of intensifying the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty to the congress, the congress then unanimously passed an emergency motion opposing the visit of the U.S. President to Japan. To this end, "Sohyo" will hold a large-scale mass rally near the Diet on June 11 to protest Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

　　Kaoru Ota, Chairman of "Sohyo," pointed out in his speech that the victory of the June 4th general strike against the new "Security Treaty" gave the trade unions and the people confidence. Sanzo Nosaka spoke at the meeting. He suggested that the workers of "Sohyo" bring forward the second general strike against the new "Security Treaty" a few days earlier than originally planned, no later than June 15. Sanzo Nosaka emphasized that this is because the Kishida Nobusuke group is frantically trying to force the new "Security Treaty" through the House of Councillors as soon as possible by all means.

　　It is reported that representatives of "Sohyo" member unions immediately held an emergency meeting after today's conference and decided to hold a second general strike on June 15. This decision will be submitted to the conference as a suggestion for discussion at tomorrow's plenary session. According to reports, in this general strike, private enterprise unions will strike for 24 hours, and the time for government employees to conduct a struggle will also exceed the June 4th general strike.

　　Inejiro Asanuma said in his speech that Prime Minister Kishida Nobusuke is now regarding Eisenhower's visit to Japan as a kind of reliance, which is a comprador behavior relying on foreign powers. He pointed out that Eisenhower's visit to Japan aims to establish a strategic system in the Far East, which is an interference in Japan's internal affairs.

　　The "Sohyo" congress will discuss and adopt the struggle policy tomorrow.

    千百万人同心反对日美军事同盟条约
    日本全国展开大规模签名运动
    “赤旗报”号召举行第二次总罢工迫使岸信介下台和解散国会
    总评举行全国代表大会制订反对日美军事条约的斗争方针
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地今天和昨天举行了两天的签名运动，反对批准新日美“安全条约”。
    这个签名运动是由社会党、共产党和二千多个反对“安全条约”共同斗争组织发起的，目标是征集二千七百万个反对“安全条约”的签名。
    在东京，签名活动在一百多个地方进行。许多团体的青年自发地挨家逐户地访问市民，请全家在反对“安全条约”的签名簿上写下名字。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治、中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄、中央委员会委员伊井弥四郎站在东京三大车站前面带头进行征集签名，号召行人签名反对违背日本民族利益和威胁亚洲和平的日美军事同盟条约。
    自从岸信介集团施用法西斯暴力在众议院片面“通过”这个条约以来，反对“安全条约”的签名运动迅速发展，签名人数显著增加。特别值得注意的是农村的签名运动在不断发展。在长野县的一个村庄里，有80％以上的村民在5月底就在反对“安全条约”的请愿书上签了名。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本工人阶级举行第二次总罢工，迫使岸信介内阁总辞职、解散众议院和阻止艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    社论说，日本共产党认为，举行更大规模的第二次总罢工的形势已经成熟。社论建议举行第二次总罢工的日期不迟于6月15日。
    社论列举日本广大阶层人民对六·四总罢工的各种形式的支持，说明举行第二次总罢工的条件已经成熟。社论指出，六·四总罢工以后岸信介掩饰他的动摇，仍然采取高压政策，这种形势要求日本工人阶级采取坚决的行动。
    社论强调说，如果在6月15日以前举行同征集反对日美军事同盟条约的签名运动、抗议大会和抗议艾森豪威尔访问日本的运动结合起来的第二次总罢工，一定能够使目前的局面发生根本变化。
    社论号召全体日本工人立即开始为举行第二次总罢工进行准备，并且要求工会领袖再接再厉发动第二次全国性罢工。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在大牟田市举行为期两天的全国代表大会，大会将制定斗争方针，以便使反对新日美“安全条约”和支持三池煤矿工人罢工的斗争获得彻底胜利。
    参加这次代表大会的共有两千名工会活动家和应邀参加大会的来宾，其中包括来自全国各地的五十七个会员工会的代表和正在进行罢工斗争的三井煤矿工会的代表们。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三和社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎都参加了大
　 会。
    在“总评”事务局长岩井章向大会提出了加紧进行反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争方针后，大会接着一致通过了紧急动议，反对美国总统访问日本。为此，“总评”将在6月11日在国会附近举行声势浩大的群众大会，抗议艾森豪威尔访日。
      “总评”议长太田薰在会上讲话时指出，反对新“安全条约”的六·四总罢工的胜利，使工会和人民有了信心。野坂参三在会上讲话。他建议“总评”所属工人把反对新“安全条约”的第二次总罢工比原订计划提前几天、不迟于6月15日举行。野坂参三强调说，这是因为岸信介集团正在疯狂地用一切办法想及早强行在参议院通过新“安全条约”。
    据报道，“总评”会员工会代表在今天的大会后立即召开紧急会议，决定在6月15日举行第二次总罢工。这项决定将作为向大会提出的建议，在明天的全体大会上讨论。消息说，在这次总罢工中，私营企业工会将罢工二十四小时，政府雇员举行实力斗争的时间也将超过六·四总罢工。
    浅沼稻次郎在会上讲话说，现在岸信介首相把艾森豪威尔访问日本一事当做一种依靠，这是仰仗外国权力的买办行为。他指出，艾森豪威尔访问日本，目的在于建立远东的战略体系，这是干涉日本内政。
    “总评”大会将在明天讨论和通过斗争方针。
