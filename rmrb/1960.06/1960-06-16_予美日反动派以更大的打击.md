Give the U.S.-Japan Reactionaries a Greater Blow
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Emboldened by the victory of the June 4th general strike, Japan's heroic 5.8 million workers launched a larger and longer general political strike yesterday. This is a major struggle within the 18th National Unified Action, which began on June 11th. Just as the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are attempting to suppress the Japanese people's anti-Kishi and anti-U.S. struggle, arresting workers and students on a large scale, and forcibly completing the procedures for passing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Japanese working class, together with the people of the whole country, demonstrated their tenacious will to persist in the struggle in this unified action with the general strike as its core, and gave the U.S.-Japan reactionaries a new and powerful blow.

The 111 trade unions of the "General Council of Trade Unions of Japan" (Sohyo) and the neutral trade union system, disregarding the intimidation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, started a nationwide strike according to the original plan. The unions of the entire transportation system, especially the National Railway Workers' Union, held workplace rallies at 21 stations and engine depots across the country, carrying out joint operations centered on freight cars. The 145 unions belonging to private railway workers held timed strikes, causing passenger and freight transportation and other transportation to be suspended at different times. Unions in private enterprises such as coal mines, metal mines, and synthetic chemicals held 24-hour strikes. Teachers, postal workers, and government employees also joined the struggle. At the same time, farmers, students, cultural circles, professors, housewives, and citizens in Tokyo and throughout the country widely participated in the unified action on this day. More than 30,000 people poured into the Diet, Kishi Nobusuke's official residence, and the U.S. Embassy to hold petitions and demonstrations. More than 600 professors from Kyoto University held rallies and marches. Students from Kyoto University and other universities held strikes, and 2,000 stores in Osaka held market strikes. Farmers in Niigata, Gunma, and other places held meetings to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The Japanese people's anti-Kishi and anti-U.S. patriotic united front is exerting an increasingly powerful united force, breaking through numerous obstacles, and pushing the patriotic and righteous struggle to a new climax.

After its various conspiracies were frustrated, the Kishi Nobusuke government resorted to bloody suppression by any means. A large number of fascist bandits bought by the Kishi Nobusuke clique, under the cover of the Japanese police, attacked demonstrating students, killing two students and injuring nearly 300 students, causing serious bloodshed. The people of Japan are extremely indignant at the June 15th bloodshed caused by the Kishi Nobusuke clique. The statement issued by the Socialist Party expresses how indignant the Japanese public is. Before the general strike, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department carried out large-scale searches of factories and schools and arrested workers and students. The Kishi Nobusuke government also carried out "the largest-scale security deployment since the founding of the country," mobilizing one-fifth of the entire Japanese police force—25,000 fully armed police officers—and also bought and mobilized fascist rogue bandits in Tokyo to deal with workers' strikes and mass demonstrations. Now, the blood shed by the patriotic people of Japan has thoroughly exposed the ugly face of the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government, which, in order to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and "protect" Eisenhower's visit to Japan, does not hesitate to suppress the Japanese people with bloody massacres. The Chinese people express their unparalleled indignation at the Kishi Nobusuke government's perverse acts and crimes of massacring the people, and extend their cordial condolences to the dead and injured patriotic Japanese students and their families.

While massively suppressing the people's struggle with armed force in order to welcome its American master's visit to Japan, the Kishi Nobusuke government is doing everything possible to promote that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is "unrelated to politics" and "unrelated to the new security treaty," attempting to confuse the public and paralyze the Japanese people's will to fight. It even shamelessly sings "the whole nation welcomes Eisenhower's visit to Japan," advocates that all political parties temporarily "cease political fire," and plays the deceptive trick of adjourning the Diet to welcome their master. Obviously, the purpose of all these conspiratorial means is to ease the increasingly high fighting will of the broad masses of the Japanese people. But the Kishi Nobusuke clique's conspiracy will never succeed. Even the Japan Broadcasting Corporation has openly expressed "deep doubts" about the Kishi Nobusuke clique's deceptive propaganda. Kyodo News Agency pointed out long ago that Eisenhower's visit to Japan was to "make the new security treaty come into effect" and "give the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which is facing a dying state, a final boost." Sada Tadataka, Director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, also refuted the deceptive arguments of the Kishi Nobusuke clique, saying that when the Kishi Nobusuke government attempts to use the U.S. President's visit to Japan for domestic politics, and the overwhelming majority of the Japanese people demand the Kishi government to step down to safeguard democracy, the U.S. President's visit to Japan is in fact an interference in Japan's internal affairs. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hastily passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on the 14th, in which the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other to promote the conspiracy of aggressive war and enslavement of the Japanese people in Asia, and is preparing to submit it to the Senate plenary session for final approval on the 16th. This further exposes the lie that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is "unrelated to politics." The so-called "political ceasefire" of the Kishi Nobusuke clique is only a temporary delaying tactic. It has already clearly announced that the Japanese Senate will forcibly "approve" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty before the 26th of this month.

The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has always developed in the continuous struggle against the various conspiracies and tricks of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Now, they will certainly be able to defeat the new conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and give the U.S.-Japan reactionaries new and greater blows.

    予美日反动派以更大的打击
    本报评论员
    在“六·四”总罢工的胜利鼓舞下，日本英勇的五百八十万工人，昨天举行了规模更大、时间更长的总政治罢工。这是从11日开始的第十八次全国统一行动的一个重大斗争。正当美日反动派企图压制日本人民反岸反美斗争，大肆逮捕工人学生，强行完成通过日美军事同盟条约手续的时候，日本工人阶级和全国人民一起，在这次以总罢工为核心的统一行动中，显示了他们坚持斗争的顽强意志，给了美日反动派以一个新的有力的打击。
    日本“总评”和中立工会系统的一百一十一个工会，不顾岸信介政府的恫吓，按照原定计划，开始了全国性的大罢工。全部交通运输系统的工会，特别是国营铁道工会在全国二十一个车站和机务段举行了工作场所大会，进行以货车为中心的联合作战，私营铁道工会所属一百四十五个工会则举行了定时罢工，使客货运和其他交通运输在不同时间内宣告停顿。煤矿、金属矿山、合成化学等私营企业的工会举行二十四小时罢工。教职员、邮政职工和政府职员也投入了斗争。与此同时，东京和全国各地的农民、学生、文化界、教授、家庭主妇和市民，广泛地参加了这一天的统一行动。三万多人涌向国会、岸信介官邸和美国大使馆举行请愿和示威。京都大学六百多位教授举行集会和游行。京都大学等学生举行罢课，大阪两千家商店举行罢市。新潟、群马等地农民纷纷集会反对艾森豪威尔访日。日本人民反岸反美的爱国统一战线，正在发挥出日益强大的团结力量，冲破重重障碍，把爱国正义斗争推向新的高潮。
    岸信介政府在种种阴谋遭到挫折后，竟不择手段地采取了血腥镇压手段。岸信介集团收买的大批法西斯匪徒，在日本警察的掩护下，对示威学生进行袭击，打死学生两名，打伤学生近三百名，造成了严重的流血事件。日本全国人民对岸信介集团造成的6月15日血案，万分激昂，社会党对此发表的声明，正表示了日本公众是如何地愤激。在总罢工之前，东京警视厅就大举搜查工厂学校，逮捕工人学生；岸信介政府并进行“建国以来规模最大的戒备部署”，动员日本全体警察的五分之一——二万五千名全副武装的警察，还收买和动员了东京的法西斯流氓匪徒，来对付工人罢工和群众示威。现在，日本爱国人民流的鲜血，彻底揭穿了岸信介卖国政府为了通过日美军事同盟条约，“保护”艾森豪威尔访日，不惜以血腥屠杀来镇压日本人民的狰狞面目。中国人民对于岸信介政府这种倒行逆施，屠杀人民的罪行表示无比的愤慨，对死伤的日本爱国学生及其家属致以亲切的慰问。
    岸信介政府为了迎接它的美国主子访日，在大规模武装镇压人民斗争的同时，正竭尽一切力量鼓吹艾森豪威尔访日“同政治无关”，“同新安全条约无关”，企图以此混淆视听、麻痹日本人民的斗争意志。它甚至卑鄙地高唱“全民欢迎艾森豪威尔访问日本”，鼓吹各政党暂时“政治休战”，玩弄国会休会的欺骗手法，来迎接他们的主子。显然，这一切阴谋手段的目的，都在于缓和广大日本人民日益昂扬的斗争意志。但岸信介集团的阴谋是决不会得逞的。连日本广播协会电台也对岸信介集团的欺骗宣传公开表示“深刻的怀疑”。共同社早就指出艾森豪威尔访日是为了使得“新安全条约获得成立”，“给面临死亡状态的岸信介内阁最后打气”。日本社会党国际局长佐多忠隆也驳斥岸信介集团的欺骗论调说：在岸信介政府企图把美国总统访日利用于国内政治，压倒多数的日本人民维护民主要求岸政府下台的时候，美国总统要前来访问日本事实上是对日本内政的干涉。美国参议院外交委员会14日已经匆匆通过了美日反动派互相勾结在亚洲推行侵略战争阴谋和奴役日本人民的日美军事同盟条约，并且准备在16日提交参议院全体会议最后批准。这就进一步揭穿了艾森豪威尔访日“同政治无关”的谎言。岸信介集团所谓的“政治休战”只不过是暂时的缓兵之计。它自己已经明白宣布日本参议院将在本月26日以前强行“批准”日美军事同盟条约。
    日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，一直就是在同美日反动派种种阴谋诡计不断的斗争中发展起来的，现在，他们也一定能够击败美日反动派的新阴谋，给予美日反动派以新的更大的打击。
