Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: Students from almost all universities in Tokyo went on strike yesterday to protest the atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous government's police and the so-called "natural establishment" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Students at Hosei University decided to strike indefinitely at a general meeting held on the 20th. Although the authorities of Tokyo University called on students to attend classes, all classes were actually suspended yesterday because the students simply did not go to school. The Central Committee of the Student Self-Government Association of the University of Education also decided to strike on the 21st and 22nd. Tokyo Gakugei University also suspended all classes yesterday and convened a joint meeting of all students, professors, associate professors, and lecturers to discuss methods of fighting against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Many middle school students have also joined the struggle against the "Security Treaty." On June 18, approximately three thousand middle school students participated in demonstrations in Tokyo, and five thousand middle school and university students held an all-night sit-in protest demonstration outside Nobusuke Kishi's official residence.

A leader of the middle school student anti-revision "Security Treaty" conference said, "We have risen to fight because we cannot tolerate the current misgovernment."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: The evening edition of the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" on the 20th published a letter in the reader's column from Watanabe Toku, an elementary school teacher in Tokyo, discussing the reaction of Japanese elementary school students to the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

Watanabe wrote: "When I stepped into the classroom on the morning of June 16, I found the classroom to be particularly restless. Obviously, the students were excited by the scenes of student demonstrations they had seen on television the day before." On June 15, 280,000 people held a powerful patriotic demonstration in Tokyo, and the Nobusuke Kishi government's police brutally beat to death a female student and injured hundreds of demonstrators.

The teacher wrote: "Immediately, a boy shouted: 'I am against the Security Treaty.' This caused a commotion among the whole class. They began to condemn Nobusuke Kishi with all the words they could muster. Some shouted: 'Down with the police!'"

He said: "Finally, they surrounded me and demanded that I publicly oppose the Security Treaty. I was at a loss. How I wished I could say that I also opposed the Security Treaty. However, I suppressed my feelings and said that I could not express my attitude."

The teacher wrote: "However, the children were not satisfied with my vague answer. Finally, they began to demand that I organize an elementary school student federation and take them to participate in anti-Security Treaty demonstrations."

This unrest continued for two or three hours until I abandoned the normal lessons for that morning. Even during the noon break, their cries against the Security Treaty echoed in the teachers' room.

    卖国条约绑在身　学生读书难安心
    东京大中学生罢课示威　小学生也要参加斗争
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：东京的几乎所有大学的学生昨天都举行罢课，抗议岸信介卖国政府警察的暴行和新日美“安全条约”的所谓“自然成立”。
    法政大学的学生在20日举行的全体大会上决定无限期罢课。东京大学当局虽然号召学生上课，但由于学生们根本不到学校里去，实际上，昨天所有的课都停止了。教育大学的学生自治会中央委员会会议也决定在21日和22日罢课。昨天东京学艺大学也全部停课，并召开了全体学生、教授、副教授和讲师联席会议来讨论反对新日美“安全条约”斗争的方法问题。
    许多中学生也投入了反对“安全条约”的斗争。6月18日，大约有三千名中学生参加了东京的示威游行，五千名中学生和大学生一起在岸信介官邸外面举行了通宵的静坐抗议示威。
    中学生反对修改“安全条约”会议的领导人说，“我们起来斗争是因为我们不能容忍目前的劣政。”
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：20日的日本“朝日新闻”晚刊在读者栏里登载了东京一位小学教师渡边悳的来信，谈到了日本小学生对反对“安全条约”运动的反应。
    渡边写道：“当我在6月16日早上踏进教室时，我发现教室分外的不安静。显然，孩子们从电视中看到的前一天的学生示威的情景引起了他们的激动。”在6月15日那天，东京二十八万人举行了强大的爱国示威，岸信介政府的警察残暴地打死一名女学生，打伤数百名示威者。
    这位教师写道：“立刻有一个男孩子高呼：‘我反对安全条约’。这使全班学生处于骚动之中。他们开始用他们所能讲的话来谴责岸信介。有些人高呼：‘打倒警察’。”
    他说：“最后，他们围住我，要求我公开反对安全条约。我手足无措。我多么希望我能讲，我也反对安全条约。但是，我抑止了我的感情，并且说，我不能表示我的态度。”
    这位教师写道：“但是孩子们不满意我的模糊的答复。最后，他们开始要求我组织一个小学生联合会，带他们去参加反对安全条约示威。”
    这种不平静继续了两三个小时，直到我放弃了那天上午的正常课程。甚至在中午休息时，他们的反对安全条约的叫声也传进教师室里。
