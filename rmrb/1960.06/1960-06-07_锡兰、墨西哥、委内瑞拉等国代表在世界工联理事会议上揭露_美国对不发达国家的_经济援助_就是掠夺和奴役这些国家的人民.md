Xinhua News Agency, June 6th -- At the meeting held this morning at the Eleventh Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, representatives from Cuba, Japan, the Americas, and Africa spoke passionately about their heroic struggles against the common enemy of the people of the world - US imperialism, showing that the storm of people in these countries and regions against imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States is rising even more greatly.

    Cuban people are not afraid of American threats

    De la Aguilera, Propaganda Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Federation, spoke as a specially invited representative. He expressed the strong will of the heroic Cuban people to oppose US imperialist aggression and defend the achievements of the revolution. He said that US monopoly capital has always been our oppressor, and now it is taking various evil means to try to undermine our independence. A new crime of the United States is Eisenhower's recent announcement to reduce the quota for importing Cuban sugar. It wants to use this despicable method to scare us. However, we are not afraid of its interference or its intimidation.

    De la Aguilera emphasized that the US imperialists have forgotten the unanimous voice of one and a half million people in Havana, "Either defend the motherland or die." He said, "The motherland is ours, and death is for US imperialism."

    After describing the achievements of the Cuban revolution, De la Aguilera said that US imperialists are trying to undermine our revolution because the Cuban revolution is already an example for 200 million people in Latin America. Our current task is to defend the revolution and the motherland. We must not relax our vigilance against imperialism for a minute. We are determined not to return to those terrible days of the past, and nothing can stop our revolution. We must use one minute to complete an hour's work day and night, month after month, year after year.

    At the end of De la Aguilera's speech, there was a long and enthusiastic applause, and many representatives went up to shake hands with him warmly.

    Specially invited representative, Suzuki Seiichi, Dispute Countermeasures Department Chief of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, reported to the conference on the fierce struggle of the Japanese people to abolish the Japan-US "Security Treaty." He said that Japanese workers will continue to struggle against the Japan-US "Security Treaty" until the day of victory. He called on trade unions of various countries affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions to support the struggle of Japanese workers, hoping that this Council meeting will make a decision requiring affiliated member groups to make resolutions or take joint actions separately. (For a detailed summary of Suzuki Seiichi's speech, see page 6 of today's newspaper)

    Imperialism has become a paper tiger in the eyes of the people

    Rubens Iscaro, Executive Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and General Secretary of the Argentine Construction Workers' Union, emphasized in his speech that US imperialism is the main enemy of the people all over the world, and peace can only be achieved through the struggle of the people. He said that US imperialism sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, thus exposing the two-faced policy of US imperialism and its true face of playing false peace. This aggressive action of US imperialism once again exposed the aggressive nature of imperialism.

    He pointed out that in the current situation, workers all over the world should make their struggle more clearly anti-imperialist than ever before. The struggle against imperialism is the struggle for peace.

    When Iscaro talked about the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Latin America, he said that the people of Latin America are no longer afraid of imperialism, and it has truly become a paper tiger in the eyes of the people.

    When talking about the purpose of the World Federation of Trade Unions, he emphasized that in the current international situation, the purpose of the World Federation of Trade Unions must be explained in order to inspire the working class of the world to fight against the main enemy - US imperialism.

    Specially invited representative, Felix Dixon, Education Secretary of the Panamanian Trade Union Federation, said that the most important movement of the Panamanian people and workers at present is to recover the sovereignty over the Panama Canal area occupied by US imperialism. He strongly condemned the US imperialist brutal exploitation of Panamanian workers and the brutal suppression of the Panamanian people and workers.

    Badry, Chairman of the Mauritius Agricultural and Handicraft Workers' Union, spoke. He brought the fraternal greetings of the island of Mauritius to the people of the Soviet Union and China, and the Mauritian workers regarded the people of the Soviet Union and China as outstanding fighters for maintaining freedom and equality. He said that on the island of Mauritius, we are fighting to get rid of the rule of the capitalist regime. For this purpose, we must first seek political liberation so that the trade union movement can develop freely and without hindrance.

    Where there are colonial shackles, there is workers' struggle

    Lajoesoa, General Secretary of the Madagascar Labor Union Federation, spoke. He pointed out that colonialism is the root cause of the enslavement and oppression of workers and peasants in colonies, and where there are colonial shackles, there will be workers' struggle. He said that the interests of the workers of Madagascar are consistent with the interests of the whole people, and they are playing an increasingly important role in the struggle for national independence and sovereignty. Under the pressure of the national liberation struggle, French imperialism has recognized the independence of Madagascar. However, Lajoesoa continued, while imperialism was forced to recognize political independence, it did not give up control of the means of production, and the people of Madagascar are still in poverty. In order to maintain its control, imperialism has supported a dictatorial government that implements the policies of US imperialism.

    Diallo Seydou (Guinea), General Secretary of the General Federation of Black African Workers, said in his speech that all conscious people in Africa are well aware that only by opposing colonialism can African countries end their underdeveloped state. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions is the most reliable ally of the workers of Black Africa, and the World Federation of Trade Unions should strengthen its activities in Africa.

    However, Seydou also expressed in his speech that he still insisted on the so-called "making the people of all countries advance in a gradual, pleasant and harmonious way."

    Specially invited representative, Mohammed Dahan (Somaliland), representative of the African Independent Trade Union Federation, said at the meeting that Somaliland workers are struggling to improve their living and working conditions. He pointed out that the progress of the Somaliland workers' struggle is also reflected in the improvement of workers' political awareness, and they will no longer be deceived by capitalists and imperialists flaunting freedom, equality, and fraternity.

    Supka, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia, condemned the crime of the United States in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit in his speech today. He said that the provocative attitude of the United States and the stubborn attitude of its allies should be held responsible for the failure of the Four-Power Summit. Their shameless defense of this provocative attitude has aroused the anger of peace-loving and progressive people all over the world.

    He pointed out that the Soviet Union's just attitude in Paris was welcomed by people all over the world.

    Supka said that the Soviet government recently put forward proposals for comprehensive and complete disarmament. These proposals are in line with the interests of the workers, and they have been supported by peace-loving and progressive people all over the world, and we will fight to realize these proposals.

    Supka said that the Czechoslovak people attach great importance to the issue of signing a peace treaty with Germany, and believe that this is an important measure to permanently eliminate imperialist military provocations and West German militarist adventures. He pointed out that turning West Berlin into a free city will gradually eliminate a center of the Cold War, a center of espionage, and a center for harassing the German Democratic Republic, which is completely in line with the interests of Germany's neighboring countries and the German people.

    Heilich Finke, a specially invited representative from West Germany and a member of the West German Metalworkers' Union, condemned in his speech the crimes of the West German Adenauer government in actively reviving militarism and implementing a war policy, regardless of the life and death of the West German people. He pointed out that Adenauer is the most loyal lackey of the United States. Today's Adenauer is no different from the Hitler of the past.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th -- The World Federation of Trade Unions Council continued to hold a meeting in the afternoon of the 6th, and many representatives continued to severely condemn the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism in their speeches, and exposed the deceptive conspiracy of US imperialism's so-called "aid to backward countries." They emphasized that safeguarding world peace must rely on the struggle of the working class and the masses of the people of the world, and the most reliable guarantee of lasting peace is to isolate and weaken US imperialism.

    Isolating and weakening US imperialism is a reliable guarantee of peace

    Mendis, Executive Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, said in his speech that one of the most important tasks of trade unions today is to analyze the influence of US imperialism in every capitalist country and launch a movement among workers and people of other strata to expose it. He said that for several years, US imperialism has shamelessly put forward the following demands as conditions for giving Ceylon "aid": ① Restrict trade union rights and suppress progressive movements; ② Facilitate American investment; ③ Give the "Asia Foundation" the convenience to carry out activities; ④ Allow the United States to use bases for military purposes. Due to the opposition of the people, Ceylon did not accept this "aid." Experience has proved that any country that accepts this aid will become a colony of the United States.

    Mendis pointed out that today the only goal of US imperialism is to rule the world. US imperialism is playing the role of Nazism, but on a larger scale and with more vicious methods. He believes that in order to strengthen peace, it is necessary to struggle to get some countries out of the control and influence of US imperialism. The most reliable guarantee of lasting peace is to isolate and weaken US imperialism, and the struggle of colonies and oppressed people in various countries is another great contribution to lasting peace.

    Mendis said that the great Asian city of Beijing, where we are holding the meeting, is the place where the World Federation of Trade Unions Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference was held eleven years ago immediately after the great victory of the Chinese revolution. At that historic meeting attended by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, the World Federation of Trade Unions formulated the general line for trade unions and progressive movements in Asian and Australian countries. This Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions will undoubtedly make a far-reaching contribution to the great cause we are engaged in.

    In his speech, he expressed his attitude towards the "Free Trade Union." He believes that we must continue to fight for unity. However, we feel that the American imperialist agents within the "Free Trade Union" have not been exposed enough. He said, let the members of the "Free Trade Union" understand what kind of people their leaders are. These renegade "Free Trade Union" leaders are imperialist lackeys who actively support imperialist war plans and collude with monopoly capitalists. Mendis believes that it is necessary to correctly expose these people in order to win over upright people and the masses in the leading institutions. At the same time, it is necessary to develop friendly contacts and connections with upright trade union workers in the "Free Trade Union" and its member organizations.

    The current task of trade unions is to expose and isolate imperialism

    Toledano (Mexico), Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, said in his speech that the current task of our trade unions is to mobilize workers and peasants to expose imperialism and isolate them.

    He said that US imperialism is the main enemy of the people of Latin America. US imperialism has exhausted all means and created various nice-sounding words in an attempt to deceive the people of Latin America. However, the facts are here: US imperialism has 9 billion US dollars of investment in Latin America, and the people of Latin American countries are becoming increasingly impoverished under American exploitation.

    He said that US imperialism's "aid" and "help" to Latin American countries is only to take huge profits from the vast land of Latin America, plunder the rich natural resources of this continent, and prevent these countries from independence and progress.

    Toledano emphasized that there must be no illusion that US imperialism will automatically change its consciousness. Because monopoly capital will never give up the goal of pursuing maximum profits. US imperialism will always be the enemy of the independent and autonomous development of Latin America.

    At the beginning of his speech, Toledano said that the main issue in the current international situation is the issue of defending peace. The forces of peace are much greater than the forces of war, and this should be the starting point for studying all issues in the international situation. Finally, he proposed a suggestion to hand over the study of the relationship between imperialist countries and underdeveloped countries to the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions for discussion.

    Anton Moisasku, Vice Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Romania, pointed out in his speech that today the forces of peace and socialism are invincible.

    Moisasku said that the imperialist group headed by the United States is the main factor in launching a new war. He condemned the American militarist group for sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit.

    Moisasku said that the Romanian people fully support the Soviet Union's just position and Khrushchev's statement in Paris. He suggested that the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of its more than 100 million members, submit a memorandum to the United Nations, requesting it to condemn American aggression and take measures to prevent such actions that endanger the peace and security of the people.

    Moisasku emphasized the importance of the united action of the working class of the world. He said that the main obstacle on the road to unity is the actions of the right-wing leaders of the "Free Trade Union," who are lackeys of monopoly capital. It is necessary to continuously expose these right-wing trade union leaders in order to raise the awareness of the working class, which will be conducive to opening the road to unity. Moisasku also said that they agree with the content of the two reports of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting.

    Pastolino, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay, spoke.

    In his speech, Pastolino listed the struggles of the people of various Latin American countries such as Cuba, Argentina, and Panama, illustrating that the people's struggle against imperialism has never been as high as it is today. Pastolino said that the "backyard" of US imperialism is not peaceful. The US imperialist propaganda that imperialism is invincible has been bankrupted. Workers in various Latin American countries are gradually getting rid of the influence of reformism.

    The working people have no illusions about US imperialism

    Based on the experience of the workers of Zanzibar in their struggle against British colonists, Ali Sultan, representative of Zanzibar, emphasized in his speech the importance of thoroughly exposing the true face of revisionists. He said that those traitors of the working class, lackeys of imperialism, revisionists, are trying to lower our awareness, limit the scope of our activities to purely striving for shorter working hours, higher wages, and improved working conditions, and deviate from the most important field - liberating the working class from colonialism, imperialism, and capitalist exploitation, thereby keeping the system that directly opposes the interests of the working class intact and making it permanent. In order to achieve its goal of liberating the working class all over the world, the international working-class movement must thoroughly expose these revisionists and completely isolate them.

    Ali Sultan emphasized that we are fully convinced that the greatest enemy of the working people is US imperialism, and we have no illusions in this regard.

    As long as the imperialist system exists, there is a possibility of war

    Ali Sultan also emphasized the need to expose the conspiracy of warmongers and link the struggle for peace with the struggle for national liberation of the oppressed people in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the world. He said that, in our view, there can only be true peace when the working class is completely liberated from the system that produces war - the imperialist system. As long as the imperialist system exists, there is a possibility of war, there is a struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors, and between the "protected" and the "protectors." He expressed the hope that this Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions would actively support the struggle of the people of Zanzibar for national independence.

    Shaban Dahaksan, Secretary of the United Committee of Iranian Trade Unions, revealed in his speech that US imperialism has turned Iran into its colony. The struggle of Iranian workers and peasants against imperialism and its lackeys is developing. This situation has greatly panicked the reactionary rulers, so much so that after the Turkish incident, the king wantonly arrested and slaughtered innocent people.

    Adreas Ziartides, Council Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and General Secretary of the Pan-Cypriot Labor Federation, said in his speech that our trade union often mobilizes workers and peasants to oppose imperialism turning Cyprus into a military base. The existence of imperialist military bases is a great irony to Cyprus' "independence."

    He said that our trade union attaches great importance to the summit meeting, but we also pointed out that imperialism has been sabotaging the summit meeting. He also said this: After the breakdown of the meeting, "the workers were neither disappointed, nor did they know who was responsible for the failure of this meeting at the time. The Cypriot workers believe in the peace policy of socialist countries, and they distrust imperialism."

    Eloy Torres, Organization Secretary of the Venezuelan Workers' Federation, said in his speech that imperialism is trying its best to maintain and intensify the Cold War. He said that in order to oppose such an enemy as US imperialism, the progressive and democratic strata of Latin America must be united like one person, and the Latin American trade union movement must hold high the banner of unity.

    Having illusions about American investment is falling into the mud pit

    Torres revealed that US imperialism is intensifying its economic aggression against Latin American countries. He pointed out that having illusions that foreign investment will be beneficial to the development of the national economy is falling into the mud pit, because the essence of imperialism is to extract high profits. He cited many figures to illustrate the economic plunder of Venezuela by foreign capital, and the profits it extracted greatly exceeded the investment itself. The purpose of US imperialist investment is also to force the governments of their countries to depend on American trusts.

    Eduardo-Valentin Mudombe, First General Secretary of the National Confederation of Workers of the Congo, spoke about the tragic situation of the Congo under imperialist rule. He said that the awakening of the people is fierce. The myth created by Belgian colonialists that the Congolese are satisfied with their fate has gone bankrupt. The Congo will become independent on June 30 this year.

    However, Mudombe went on to point out that this does not mean the true independence that the Congolese people demand. He said that imperialists are implementing a "divide and rule" policy, re-igniting disputes between various Congolese tribes, and using various means such as bribery and corruption in an attempt to continue to maintain their rule.

    Nikola Alekseyev, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Bulgaria, said in his speech that the American imperialist provocation that disrupted the Paris Summit showed that the people should be vigilant against warmongering forces and resolutely fight for complete and thorough disarmament.

    He believed that the Executive Committee's report showed how huge a responsibility workers and trade unions have for defending peace and how huge the possibilities are for developing their activities, because today the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war. He also believed that workers belonging to different trade union organizations should cooperate domestically and internationally, which is an important responsibility of the World Federation of Trade Unions and national trade union organizations at present.

    Nikola Alekseyev expressed unconditional support for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, believing that the Council meeting should adopt a statement or document to support the Soviet plan for disarmament and call on world workers' organizations to force those governments that are skeptical and passive about disarmament to take a strong position and support the Soviet proposal.

    He went on to say that the Bulgarian workers fully support the policies of their People's Government, striving to ease the situation in the Balkans and establish friendly relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries. The Bulgarian trade union believes that striving for united action and striving for cooperation among workers in Balkan countries is their highest task. He expressed that the Bulgarian workers welcome every action towards peace and peaceful coexistence. He also said that their delegation fully supports the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee's assessment of the current international situation in its report.

    Ibrahim Mohammed Burete, General Secretary of the Somaliland Trade Union Federation, a specially invited representative, conveyed at the meeting the respect and feelings of the Somaliland people and workers to the working class all over the world. He said that these feelings arise from the common cause of the working class and also reflect their common struggle against all imperialism and exploitation, especially against the paper tiger - US imperialism.

    Keita Nama, Secretary of the Federation of Trade Unions of Mali, a specially invited representative, continued to speak. He accused French colonialism, international imperialism, and their accomplices in Mali of using various means in an attempt to divert the people of Mali from the path of true liberation. He stated that the people of Mali will never stop fighting as long as the national economy is almost entirely dependent on foreign imperialism and the territory is occupied by foreign troops.

    Nikolaos Alexeiou said that the American imperialist provocation that disrupted the Paris Summit showed that the people should be vigilant against warmongering forces and resolutely fight for complete and thorough disarmament.
    He believes that the Executive Committee's report shows how huge a responsibility workers and trade unions have for defending peace and how huge the possibilities are for developing their activities, because today the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war. He also believes that workers belonging to different trade union organizations should cooperate domestically and internationally, which is an important responsibility of the World Federation of Trade Unions and national trade union organizations at present.
    Nikolaos Alexeiou expressed unconditional support for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, believing that the Council meeting should adopt a statement or document to support the Soviet plan for disarmament and call on world workers' organizations to force those governments that are skeptical and passive about disarmament to take a strong position and support the Soviet proposal.
    He went on to say that the Bulgarian workers fully support the policies of their People's Government, striving to ease the situation in the Balkans and establish friendly relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries. The Bulgarian trade union believes that striving for united action and striving for cooperation among workers in Balkan countries is their highest task. He expressed that the Bulgarian workers welcome every action towards peace and peaceful coexistence. He also said that their delegation fully supports the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee's assessment of the current international situation in its report.
    Ibrahim Muhammad Boleit, General Secretary of the Somaliland Labor Union Federation, a specially invited representative, conveyed at the meeting the respect and feelings of the Somaliland people and workers to the working class all over the world. He said that these feelings arise from the common cause of the working class and also reflect their common struggle against all imperialism and exploitation, especially against the paper tiger - US imperialism.
    Special guest representative, Keita Nama, Secretary of the Federation of Trade Unions of Mali, then spoke. He accused French colonialism, international imperialism and their accomplices in Mali of using various methods to try to separate the people of Mali from the path of true liberation. He said that the people of Mali would never stop fighting when the national economy was almost entirely dependent on foreign imperialism and the territory was occupied by foreign troops.

    锡兰、墨西哥、委内瑞拉等国代表在世界工联理事会议上揭露
    美国对不发达国家的“经济援助”  就是掠夺和奴役这些国家的人民
    据新华社6日讯　世界工会联合会理事会第十一次会议今天上午举行的会议上，来自古巴、日本和美洲、非洲的代表，激昂地畅谈他们对全世界人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的情况，显示了这些国家和地区人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的风暴，正在更大地兴起。
    古巴人民不怕美国威胁
    古巴工人联合会宣传书记德拉阿吉莱拉以特邀代表的身份讲话。他表达了英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫革命成果的坚强意志。他说，美国垄断资本一直是我们的压迫者，现在又采取各种罪恶手段企图破坏我们的独立。美国的一项新罪行，是艾森豪威尔最近宣布降低进口古巴食糖的定额。它想用这种卑鄙手段来吓唬我们。但是，我们既不怕它的干涉，也不怕它的威吓。
    德拉阿吉莱拉强调说，美帝国主义者忘记了一百五十万人在哈瓦那发出的一致呼声，“要么保卫祖国，要么死亡”。他说，“祖国是我们的，死亡是美帝国主义的”。
    德拉阿吉莱拉在叙述了古巴革命的成就后说，美帝国主义企图破坏我们的革命，这是因为古巴革命已经是拉丁美洲两亿人民的榜样。我们目前的任务就是保卫革命和祖国。我们一分钟也不能放松对于帝国主义的警惕。我们决不愿意回到过去那种可怕的日子里，天塌下来也不能阻碍我们的革命。我们要夜以继日地、月以继年地用一分钟的时间来完成一小时的工作。
    德拉阿吉莱拉讲话结束时，全场长时间的热烈鼓掌，许多代表上去和他热烈握手。
    特邀代表、日本工会总评议会争议对策部长铃木诚市向大会报告了日本人民为争取废除日美“安全条约”所进行的激烈斗争。他说，日本工人将继续进行反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，直到胜利的那一天。他呼吁世界工联所属的各国工会支持日本工人的斗争，希望这次理事会会议作出要求所属会员团体分别作出决议或采取联合行动的方针的决定。（铃木诚市的发言详细摘要见今日本报第六版）
    帝国主义已成为人民眼中的纸老虎
    世界工联执委、阿根廷建筑工会总书记鲁本斯·伊斯卡罗发言时强调指出，美帝国主义是全世界人民最主要的敌人，只有通过人民的斗争，才能取得和平。他说，美帝国主义破坏了四大国首脑会议，因而揭穿了美帝国主义的两面政策和耍假和平的真面目。美帝国主义的这种侵略行动，再一次地暴露了帝国主义的侵略本质。
    他指出，在目前情况下，全世界劳动者比任何时候更应该使他们的斗争带有更明显的反帝性质。反对帝国主义的斗争，就是争取和平的斗争。
    伊斯卡罗谈到拉丁美洲人民反帝斗争时说，拉丁美洲人民已经不害怕帝国主义了，它已经真正成了人民眼中的纸老虎。
    谈到世界工联的目的时，他强调指出，在目前国际形势下，必须把世界工联的目的加以说明，以便鼓舞世界工人阶级反对最主要的敌人——美帝国主义的斗争。
    特邀代表、巴拿马工会联合会教育书记菲利克斯·迪克逊说，巴拿马人民和工人目前最重要的运动是收回被美帝国主义霸占的巴拿马运河地区的主权。他强烈谴责美帝国主义对巴拿马工人的残酷剥削以及对巴拿马人民和工人的粗暴镇压。
    毛里求斯农业与手工业工人联合会主席巴德里发言。他带来了毛里求斯岛对苏联和中国人民兄弟般的敬礼，毛里求斯工人们视苏中人民为维护自由和平等的杰出战士。他说，在毛里求斯岛我们正在为摆脱资本主义政权的统治而斗争。为此目的，我们必须首先求得政治解放，使工会运动能自由地、不受阻碍地发展。
    那里有殖民枷锁，那里就有工人斗争
   马达加斯加工人工会联合会总
   书记拉约索亚发言。他指出殖民主义是殖民地工人、农民受奴役压迫的根源，那里有殖民枷锁，那里就有工人斗争出现。他说，马达加斯加工人的利益与全民利益是一致的，他们在争取民族独立主权的斗争中起着日益巨大的作用。在民族解放斗争的压力下，法国帝国主义已经承认马达加斯加独立。但是拉约索亚接着说，帝国主义在被迫承认政治独立时，并未放弃对生产资料的控制，马达加斯加人民仍处于贫困中。帝国主义为了维持它的控制，扶植了一个独裁政府，这个政府执行美帝国主义的政策。
    特邀代表、黑非工人总联合会总书记迪亚洛·赛杜（几内亚）在会上发言中说，非洲所有觉悟的人都很清楚，只有反对殖民主义，才能使非洲国家结束不发达状态。他说，世界工联是黑非洲工人的最可靠的同盟者，世界工联应该加强在非洲的活动。
    但是，赛杜在发言中还表示，他仍然坚持所谓“使各国人民以一种渐进的、愉快的和和谐的方式前进”的主张。
    特邀代表、非洲人独立工会联合会代表穆罕默德·达汉（索马里兰）在会上说，索马里兰工人正在为争取改善生活和劳动条件进行着斗争。他指出，索马里兰工人斗争的进展还表现在工人政治觉悟的提高，他们再也不会为标榜着自由、平等、博爱的资本家和帝国主义所欺骗了。
    世界工联副主席、捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席苏普卡今天在发言中谴责美国破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。他说，美国的挑衅态度及其盟国的顽固态度应对四国首脑会议的失败负责。它们为这种挑衅态度的无耻辩护，激起了全世界和平和进步人民的愤怒。
    他指出，苏联在巴黎的正义态度得到了全世界人民的欢迎。
    苏普卡说，最近苏联政府提出了关于全面、彻底裁军的建议。这项建议是符合工人的利益的，它得到了全世界和平和进步人民的支持，我们将为实现这些建议而斗争。
    苏普卡说，捷克斯洛伐克人民很重视签订对德和约的问题，认为这是永远消除帝国主义军事挑衅和西德军国主义冒险的一项重要措施。他指出，把西柏林变为自由城市将逐步消除一个冷战的中心、间谍的中心和对德意志民主共和国进行骚扰活动的中心，是完全符合德国的邻国以及德国人民利益的。
    来自西德的特邀代表、西德五金工会会员海利希·芬克在发言中，谴责了西德阿登纳政府不顾西德人民的死活，积极复活军国主义和执行战争政策的罪行。他指出，阿登纳是美国最忠实的走狗。今天的阿登纳同过去的希特勒没有什么区别。
    据新华社6日讯　世界工联理事会6日下午继续举行会议，许多代表在发言中继续严厉谴责美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，揭露美帝国主义所谓“援助落后国家”的欺骗阴谋。他们强调指出：保卫世界和平必须依靠世界工人阶级和人民群众的斗争，持久和平的最可靠的保证，就是孤立和削弱美帝国主义。
    孤立和削弱美帝国主义是和平的可靠保证
    世界工联执行委员、锡兰工联主席曼迪斯发言说，今天工会最重要的任务之一是分析美帝国主义在每个资本主义国家的影响，并在工人及其他阶层人民中展开运动，进行揭发。他说，几年以来，美帝国主义曾无耻地提出下列要求，作为给予锡兰“援助”的条件：①限制工会权，镇压进步运动；②便利美国投资；③给与“亚洲基金会”进行活动的便利；④允许美国为军事目的使用基地。由于人民的反对，锡兰没有接受这个“援助”。经验已经证明，任何接受这种援助的国家，将变成美国的殖民地。
    曼迪斯指出，今天美帝国主义唯一目标就是要统治世界。美帝国主义正在扮演着纳粹主义的角色，但规模更大，作法更为凶恶。他认为，为了加强和平，必须进行斗争，使一些国家摆脱美帝国主义的控制和影响。持久和平最可靠的保证就是孤立和削弱美帝国主义，殖民地以及各国被压迫人民的斗争，也是对持久和平的另一个巨大贡献。
    曼迪斯说，我们正在举行会议的伟大亚洲城市北京，是十一年前在中国革命取得伟大胜利之后立即举行世界工联亚澳工会会议的地方。在刘少奇主席出席的那次具有历史意义的会议上，世界工联制定了亚澳国家工会和进步运动的总路线。世界工联这次的理事会会议，无疑将为我们所从事的伟大事业作出具有深远意义的贡献。
    他在发言中表明对“自由工联”的态度。他认为，我们必须为团结而继续奋斗。但是，我们感到对“自由工联”内部的美帝国主义代理人揭露得不够。他说，让“自由工联”的会员了解他们的某些领袖是怎样的人物吧，这些变节的“自由工联”领袖是帝国主义的走狗，他们积极支持帝国主义战争计划，勾结垄断资本家。曼迪斯认为必须正确地揭露这些人，为了争取领导机构中的正直分子和群众。同时，必须同“自由工联”及其会员团体里的正直的工会工作者发展友好接触和联系。
    当前工会的任务是揭露和孤立帝国主义
    世界工联副主席、拉丁美洲劳联主席托列达诺（墨西哥）发言时说，当前我们工会的任务是动员工人农民揭露帝国主义，使他们孤立起来。
    他说，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲人民主要的敌人。美帝国主义用尽了各种方式，创造了各种好听的词句企图欺骗拉丁美洲人民。但是，事实摆在这里：美帝国主义在拉丁美洲有九十亿美元的投资，拉丁美洲国家人民在美国剥削下日益贫困。
    他说，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲国家的“援助”、“帮助”，只不过为了从拉丁美洲广大的土地上带走巨额的利润，掠夺这个大陆的丰富的天然资源，不让这些国家独立与进步。
    托列达诺强调说，决不能幻想美帝国主义自动改变它的意识。因为垄断资本决不会放弃追求最大限度利润的目的。美帝国主义永远是拉丁美洲独立自主发展的敌人。
    托列达诺在发言开始时说，当前国际形势中的主要问题是保卫和平的问题。拥护和平的力量比战争的力量大得多，而这应该是研究国际形势一切问题的出发点。最后他提出一个建议，把研究帝国主义国家和不发达国家的关系问题交给世界工联书记处讨论。
    罗马尼亚工会中央理事会副主席安东·莫依萨斯库在发言中指出，今天和平和社会主义的力量是不可战胜的。
    莫依萨斯库说，以美国为首的帝国主义集团是发动新战争的主要因素。他谴责美国的军国主义集团破坏巴黎四国政府首脑会议。
    莫依萨斯库说，罗马尼亚人民完全支持苏联的正义立场和赫鲁晓夫在巴黎的声明。他建议世界工联代表它的一亿多会员向联合国提出备忘录，要求谴责美国的侵略和采取措施防止这种危害人民的和平和安全的行动。
    莫依萨斯库强调世界工人阶级统一行动的重要意义。他说，团结道路上的主要障碍是“自由工联”右翼领导人的行动，他们是垄断资本的走狗。必须不断地揭露这些工会右翼领导人，以提高工人阶级的觉悟，才有利于打开统一的道路。莫依萨斯库还说：他们同意世界工联理事会会议两个报告的内容。
    世界工联副主席、乌拉圭工人总联盟总书记巴斯多利诺发言。
    巴斯多利诺在发言中列举古巴、阿根廷、巴拿马等拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争情况，说明各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争从来没有像今天这样高涨。巴斯多利诺说，美帝国主义的“后院”不安宁了。美帝国主义宣传帝国主义战无不胜，这种宣传已经遭到破产。拉丁美洲各国工人正逐渐摆脱改良主义影响。
    劳动人民对美帝国主义没有丝毫幻想
    桑给巴尔代表阿里·苏丹根据桑给巴尔工人同英国殖民者斗争的经验，在发言中强调指出彻底揭露修正主义者的真面目的重要意义。他说，那些工人阶级的叛徒、帝国主义的走狗修正主义者，企图降低我们的觉悟，把我们的活动范围限于纯粹争取缩短工时、提高工资和改善劳动条件的斗争，并脱离最重要的领域——使工人阶级从殖民主义、帝国主义和资本主义剥削中解放出来，从而原封不动地保持直接同工人阶级利益相对立的制度并使之永久存在下去。国际工人阶级运动要达到它解放全世界工人阶级的目的，必须对这些修正主义者加以彻底地揭露使它完全孤立。
    阿里·苏丹强调说，我们完全相信，劳动人民的最大敌人是美帝国主义，在这方面我们没有丝毫幻想。
    只要帝国主义制度存在，就有发生战争的可能
    阿里·苏丹还强调必须揭露战争贩子的阴谋，把争取和平的斗争同非洲、拉丁美洲、亚洲以及全世界被压迫人民争取民族解放的斗争联系起来。他说，根据我们的看法，只有当工人阶级从产生战争的制度——帝国主义制度下获得完全解放的时候，才能有真正的和平。只要帝国主义制度存在，就有发生战争的可能，就有被压迫者和压迫者之间、被“保护”者和“保护”者之间的斗争。他表示期望这次世界工联理事会会议积极支持桑给巴尔人民争取民族独立的斗争。
    伊朗工会统一委员会书记沙班·达哈克桑在发言中揭露说，美帝国主义已把伊朗变成它的殖民地。伊朗工人农民为反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，正在开展。这种情况使反动统治者大为惊慌，以至于在土耳其事件爆发以后，国王大肆逮捕和屠杀无辜的人民。
    世界工联理事、泛塞浦路斯劳工联合会总书记阿德列阿斯·齐阿蒂德斯在发言中说，我们工会经常动员工人农民反对帝国主义把塞浦路斯变成军事基地。帝国主义军事基地的存在，对塞浦路斯的“独立”是一个很大的讽刺。
    他说，我们工会很重视最高级会议，但是我们也指出，帝国主义一直在破坏最高级会议。他还这样说，会议破裂之后，“工人既不失望，当时也不知道谁对这次会议的失败负有责任，塞浦路斯工人相信社会主义国家的和平政策，他们对帝国主义是不信任的。”
    特邀代表、委内瑞拉工人联合会组织书记埃洛伊·托莱斯在讲话中指出，帝国主义正在千方百计地维持和加紧冷战。他说，为了反对美帝国主义这样一个敌人，拉丁美洲的进步和民主阶层必须团结得像一个人一样，拉丁美洲工会运动必须高举团结的旗帜。
    对美国投资有幻想就是掉进了泥坑
    托莱斯揭露说，美帝国主义正在加紧对拉丁美洲国家进行经济侵略。他指出，幻想外国投资会对发展本国经济有利，这是掉进了泥坑，因为帝国主义的本质就是榨取高额利润。他列举许多的数字来说明外国资本对委内瑞拉的经济掠夺，它所榨取的利润大大超过了投资本身。美帝国主义投资的目的还在于迫使他们国家的政府依附于美国的托辣斯。
    特邀代表、刚果全国工人联合会第一总书记爱德华—瓦朗丁·穆东伯谈到刚果在帝国主义的统治下悲惨的处境。他说，人民的觉醒是猛烈的。比利时殖民主义者编造的什么刚果人满足于自己的命运的神话已经破产。刚果将于今年6月30日独立。
    但是，穆东伯接着指出，这并不等于刚果人民所要求的真正的独立。他说，帝国主义者正在执行“分而治之”的政策，重新挑起刚果各部落间的纠纷，并且用收买、腐蚀等种种手段力图继续维持他们的统治。
    保加利亚工会中央理事会书记尼古拉·阿列克塞耶夫发言说，美帝国主义的挑衅使巴黎最高级会议遭到破坏，说明人民应该对好战势力提高警惕，坚决为争取全面彻底裁军而斗争。
    他认为，执委会的报告说明，工人和工会对于保卫和平负有多么巨大的责任，发展他们的活动有多么巨大的可能性，因为今天和平力量已经超过战争力量。他还认为，属于不同工会组织的工人应当在国内和国际进行合作，这是世界工联和各国工会组织当前的重要责任。
    尼古拉·阿列克塞耶夫表示无条件支持苏联全面彻底裁军的建议，认为理事会会议应通过声明或文件来支持苏联的争取裁军计划，并号召世界工人组织迫使那些对裁军怀疑和消极的政府采取有力的立场，支持苏联的建议。
    他接着说，保加利亚工人完全支持他们人民政府的政策，争取在巴尔干缓和局势，并同一切国家特别是邻国建立友好关系。保加利亚工会认为，争取统一行动，争取巴尔干各国工人的合作，是他们最高的任务。他表示，保加利亚工人欢迎每一个走向和平和和平共处的行动。他还说，他们代表团完全支持世界工联执委会报告中对当前国际局势的估计。
    特邀代表、索马里兰工会联合会总书记易卜拉欣·穆罕默德·伯莱特，在会上向全世界工人阶级转达索马里兰人民和工人的敬意和情感。他说这些情感产生于工人阶级的共同事业，也反映他们反对一切帝国主义和剥削，尤其是反对纸老虎——美帝国主义的共同斗争。
    特邀代表、马里联邦工会联合会书记凯达·纳玛接着讲话。他指责法国殖民主义、国际帝国主义及其在马里的同谋者，使用各种办法企图使马里人民脱离真正解放的道路。他表示，当国家经济几乎完全依靠外国帝国主义、国土被外国军队所占据的时候，马里人民决不停止斗争。
