In revolution, I recall the Tongmenghui, the early Republic of China, a dream that faded.
Reorganized the Chinese Revolutionary Party, Bo Qu's assistance achieved great feats.
The light of the October Revolution shone everywhere, alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, a good proposition.
Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang, still relying on Bo Qu as a bridge.
(Note) Comrade Li Dazhao wrote to Comrade Bo Qu to introduce Comintern representative Malin to meet with Sun Yat-sen in Guilin.
Back then, the Northern Expedition was magnificent, wielding spears eastward to conquer Nanjing.
The people's hero became a "wanted criminal,"
(Note) The Chiang family bandit gang established a court.
(Note) The Nanjing Incident was essentially a massacre of the Chinese people by imperialism, but the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, complying with the will of imperialism, falsely accused the Communist Lin Zuhan as a "Nanjing Case wanted criminal" and issued an arrest warrant.
The Nanchang "August 1st" red flag fluttered, the summer expedition defeated Shantou and Chaozhou.
Waving goodbye in Liusha, separated by vast distances,
(Note) Firm in revolutionary aspirations.
(Note) After the Nanchang Uprising troops failed in Shantou and Chaozhou, a meeting was held in Liusha, deciding to disperse. From then on, we parted with Comrade Bo Qu. Later, Comrade Bo Qu went to Moscow via Japan, where we met again.
Three years as classmates in Moscow, white-haired scholars delving with great interest.
Land problems were jointly written,
(Note) Marxism-Leninism was discussed together.
(Note) When Comrade Bo Qu and I studied at the Moscow Chinese Labor Communist University, we jointly wrote a paper on the Chinese land question.
Reforming writing for workers and peasants, eliminating illiteracy, a shared ambition.
The Latin alphabet scheme was created with one heart, and the first achievement in practical implementation. (Note)
(Note) Comrade Bo Qu and I jointly engaged in the creation of the Latinization scheme in Vladivostok. Later, in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, under the chairmanship of Comrade Bo Qu, the Latinized New Writing was popular for a time and achieved remarkable results.
Returning to China to participate in the Soviet, financial work displayed great talent.
The Long March of twenty-five thousand li, what a revolutionary old man!
The anti-Japanese center, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, the brilliant construction was admired by the world.
Leadership relied entirely on Chairman Mao, Bo Qu's assistance was particularly meritorious.
China's revolution celebrated success, from then on, the East wind prevailed over the West wind.
The world cheered for the Communist Party, and all people sang praises of Mao Zedong.
The whole people leaped forward and rejoiced, I went to southern Shanxi for the text reform.
Expecting to report on the grand occasion of Wanrong, (Note) the bad news came, and old tears streamed down.
(Note) I went to Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, in early May for inspection, planning to return to Beijing to report the achievements of Wanrong County to Comrade Bo Qu. Unexpectedly, I heard the bad news while passing through Zhengzhou, how could I bear the grief!
Bo Qu struggled to the end of his life, with a heart devoted to the Party and the people.
Although I am old, I should become stronger, vowing to inherit his legacy to comfort his loyal soul.
