    Red Cook Fang Xizhen
    She Dedicated Her Red Heart to the Public Canteen and the Great Socialist Cause.
    The People's Commune Communications Editorial Office of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Whenever you mention cook Fang Xizhen, the members of the Yanglin Second Canteen of the Tieshan Commune in Yueyang, Hunan, all praise her. Everyone says: With our Miss Xi in the canteen, we don't have to worry about food and drink. This is absolutely true. Fang Xizhen is red-hearted, skillful, hardworking, and loves the canteen, which has won her the hearts of the members. For two consecutive years, she has been selected as a model cook and attended the hero conferences held by the county and the special zone, as well as the provincial conference of women activists in socialist construction. In May of this year, she gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

              A Selfless Person
    The Yanglin Second Canteen was established in July 1958. From the very first day, Fang Xizhen came to the canteen. She is in the canteen, her heart is in the canteen, she treats the canteen as her home, and she has been like this for years. This canteen serves thirty-five households, more than one hundred and thirty people, and also provides tea for more than one hundred primary school students and passers-by. There are three cooks, one of whom is an old man and one is a weak woman. They can only help with stoking the fire, boiling water, and cleaning. All the heavy and meticulous work depends on Fang Xizhen. Whenever there are any difficulties, she always steps forward. She gets up early and works late every day, and does not complain of hardship. She does everything from steaming rice, stir-frying vegetables, transporting firewood, carrying rice, to making tofu, making pickled vegetables, serving meals, collecting leftovers and taking stock. Last December, it snowed heavily and the weather was freezing. There were still a large number of vegetables in the vegetable garden that had not been cut back. Fang Xizhen was afraid that the vegetables would be frozen, so she put on straw sandals barefoot and went out to cut vegetables in the wind and snow. Her actions moved the members and motivated Yuan Jinzi, Lin Guixiang, Lei Caiping and other members to come and help. They cut back more than thirty loads of vegetables in total. This spring, in order to store enough firewood and rice to prepare for rice transplanting, sometimes after serving lunch, she arranged for the other cooks to steam dinner, and she went to the processing plant five miles away to transport rice. There are no firewood mountains near this canteen, and firewood must be transported from a place ten miles away. After arranging things after dinner, she also actively participated in transporting firewood. In March and April this year, she participated in transporting firewood and carrying rice thirteen times.
  She is the earliest riser and the latest sleeper in the entire production team. Every day, as soon as it dawns, she comes to the canteen to boil water for the members to wash their faces, clean the bowls and utensils, and starts the day's work. After preparing three meals and tea, it gets dark, and the members finish work and rest. She and the other cooks have to steam the next day's breakfast, arrange the next day's vegetables, and sometimes make pickles, make tofu, and grind rice flour. When the other cooks go back, she is always the only one in the canteen cleaning up before going back to rest. When there are meetings and busy farming seasons, she wakes up several times a night, fearing that she has overslept. For two years, this production team has never been delayed in production because of late meals.
    She is busy with the lives of the members on weekdays, and she is even busier during festivals. This year, during the Spring Festival, the members visited relatives and friends, watched operas, and engaged in cultural activities, but she was busy in the kitchen for three days and three nights without leaving. During the busy farming season, the members are busy with production, and the logistics department that takes care of the members' lives is also busy. During rice transplanting and double抢 (qiang, meaning rushing to harvest and plant), they take care of the members to eat well and have enough to rest, and meals, vegetables, tea, and water are delivered to the fields.
    Skillfully Preparing Food for Thousands of Families
    Comrade Fang Xizhen is not only hardworking, works hard and practically, but also works skillfully and well. She uses her brains to think of ways to be both economical and allow members to eat well and have enough to eat. Last winter, according to the principle of eating more when busy and eating less when idle, she ground rice into flour and made vegetable paste with vegetables. Every day for dinner, each person had a bowl of rice and a bowl of vegetable paste, saving each person one or two and five cents of grain per day. The members all said that this method was very good, the taste was good, they ate their fill, and it saved grain. After eating for more than a month, the entire canteen saved more than two hundred kilograms of grain. At the same time, she also adopted methods such as double steaming rice and eating more vegetables to ensure that the members ate well and had enough. In cooking, she puts in a lot of effort to make the dishes taste good and have a variety of styles. Several very ordinary vegetables such as radishes, cabbage, green vegetables, and lettuce, after her skillful production, use different raw materials such as leaves, stalks, stems, and vegetable hearts, or fried, stir-fried, boiled, or braised in brown sauce. After different knife skills such as shredding, slicing, and dicing, supplemented by different seasonings such as gravy, soy sauce, and bean sauce, each dish can be made into seven, eight, or more than a dozen good dishes with different tastes, different shapes, and rich nutrition. The pickled vegetables she makes have even more varieties. Last winter, she made more than two hundred jars, thirty-four kinds of pickled vegetables, and now she still stores more than two thousand three hundred kilograms of dried vegetables and pickles. Often, the old ones have not been eaten, and the new ones are stored, so that the members can eat fragrant and refreshing pickled vegetables all year round.
    Cooking work has a lot of heavy labor. In order to improve work efficiency, reduce physical labor, and better serve the lives of the members, she actively participated in the reform of cooking utensils. The canteen has realized the automation of water and soil, the automation of gauze covers for vegetables, the use of vegetable cutting machines for cutting vegetables, the use of trolleys for delivering meals and vegetables, and the use of three-purpose machines for washing rice, measuring rice, and measuring water. At the beginning, the gears of the vegetable cutting machine were uneven, and the rotation speed was inconsistent, and the vegetable delivery and cutting were uneven. Fang Xizhen and the life team leader Lei Yaowu and the operation team leader Fang Guiyao improved the gears together to make the machine more suitable. The rice washing machine was not very easy to use at the beginning. After three improvements, the machine became flexible and light, easy to operate, and accurate in measuring water and rice, which improved work efficiency by three times compared with manual operation.
          One Person Can Satisfy a Hundred People
    An old saying goes: "It is difficult for one person to satisfy a hundred people." More than one hundred people eat in a canteen, and everyone has their own appetite and their own temper. It is not easy to make everyone satisfied. Fang Xizhen cares about people everywhere, has a kind attitude, and is meticulous and considerate, breaking this routine and achieving everyone's satisfaction. For two years, she has not lost her temper with the members once, humbly listened to various opinions, and tried her best to meet the various needs of the members. The members who work, no matter when they come back from work, can always eat hot meals and hot dishes, and the vegetables they eat are also more abundant than ordinary people. She understands everyone's temper. Some people like to eat salty food, some people like to eat light food, young and middle-aged people want to stir-fry vegetables that are raw, and old people like to eat them soft and rotten. She follows these requirements, puts different amounts of water when steaming rice, stir-fries vegetables in several pots, puts more salt for those who eat salty food, and adds more fire for those who eat rotten food, so that everyone eats to their taste. Children who lack milk need to measure rice to go back and make paste. When the weather is fine, the members want to get one or two people's rice back to cook a meal, so that they have rice soup to starch the quilts and clothes, she always patiently measures the rice and lets them take it back. More than one hundred people eat in the canteen. Every meal, she has to ask clearly who has not come to eat, whether they are sick or have something to do. If a woman is pregnant or a member has a bad appetite, they will be allowed to eat some pickled vegetables that have a sour and spicy taste. When the members are sick, and the elderly are inconvenient to come to the canteen when it rains, she sends the meals to their homes. The member Zhang Lianxi gave birth last year. For more than two months, Fang Xizhen sent her meals, vegetables, tea, and hot water every day. Pickled vegetables reduce milk for breastfeeding women, so she puts them together in a seat and adds some nutritious and milk-producing garland chrysanthemum, tofu, and spinach for them. The member Li Bijun's child was short of milk, so she cooked daylily and steamed wheat for her two or three times. She enthusiastically helps the members with happy events; she warmly entertains the guests who come to the members' homes. The single elderly people say: They have never enjoyed the blessings of their children in their lives, but now they enjoy the blessings of the canteen and the blessings of Miss Xi.
                A Red Heart
    Fang Xizhen is a person who is loyal to the collective cause, infinitely cares for others, and never considers personal gains or losses. The members said that she moved "both people and her family" to the canteen, and she is selfless in everything. She is only afraid that the members will not eat well, and even leaves her husband and children aside. She is in the canteen day and night. Her three children, one is sent to kindergarten, and two are sent to nursery. She rarely sets foot at home during the day. The youngest is only half a year old, and she is also sent to the canteen to breastfeed. Last summer, she was pregnant with her third child. The weather was hot and she could not eat. Regardless of the advice of the party branch and the leader of the operations team, she insisted on working as usual. She returned to the canteen just one month after giving birth. During the Spring Festival, a member was short of meat, and she unhesitatingly gave up her share. Fang Xizhen takes care of the members in every way, but she never relaxes in fighting against bad people and bad deeds. She found that someone was stealing chickens from the canteen and taking vegetables from the canteen, so she and the members strictly criticized and educated the people who stole public property. She remembers clearly which members eat which rationed meals and which people take the rice back. The members reflected: "Miss Xi is here, don't mess with anything, anyone who wants to mess with her can't." This is how she maintains the collective interests with a high sense of responsibility.
    Fang Xizhen is a red cook. She dedicated her red heart to the public canteen and the great socialist cause.

    红色炊事员方喜珍
    她把一颗红心献给了公共食堂，献给了伟大的社会主义事业。
    中共湘潭地委人民公社通讯编辑室
    一提起炊事员方喜珍，湖南岳阳铁山公社杨林大队杨林第二食堂的社员，没有一个不称赞的。大家的说法是：有我们喜姑娘在食堂里，吃喝二字没得操心的。这话一点也不假，方喜珍心红手巧，吃苦耐劳，热爱食堂，得到了社员们的欢心。两年来她接二连三地被评选为模范炊事员，出席过县、专区召开的群英大会和全省妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表大会。今年5月，光荣地加入了中国共产党。
              忘我的人
    杨林第二食堂是在1958年7月办起来的。第一天起，方喜珍就来到了食堂。她身在食堂，心在食堂，以食堂为家，几年如一日。这个食堂共三十五户人家，一百三十多人吃饭，还要管一百多个小学生和过往行人吃的茶水。三个炊事员，其中一个是老头，一个是体弱的妇女，他们只能帮助烧火、烧茶、打扫清洁卫生。重工夫细活全离不了方喜珍。遇到什么困难事，她总是挺身而出。她每天起早贪黑，不辞劳苦，从蒸饭、炒菜、运柴、挑米到打豆腐、做坛子菜、开餐送饭、收残检点，什么事情都干。去年腊月，大雪纷飞，天寒地冻，菜园里还有大批的菜蔬没有砍回来，方喜珍怕冻坏了菜，便赤脚穿了草鞋，顶着风雪，出门砍菜。她的行动感动了社员，带动了袁金子、林圭香、雷采平等社员都来帮忙，一共砍回了三十多担菜。今年春天，为了储足柴米准备插秧，有时在开了午饭以后，她安顿好其他炊事员蒸晚饭，自己便到五里路远的加工厂去运米。这个食堂附近没有柴山，要到十里路以外的地方去运烧柴。晚饭后她把事情安排好，也积极参加运柴。今年3、4月份，她就参加了运柴挑米十三次。
  她是整个生产队起得最早、睡得最晚的人。每日天刚蒙蒙亮就来到了食堂，为社员烧洗脸水，清洁碗筷炊具，开始了一天的工作。做完三餐茶饭，天黑了，社员收工休息，她和其他炊事员还要蒸熟第二天的早饭，安置好第二天的菜，有时还要作酱菜、作豆腐、磨米粉，别的炊事员回去了，她总是一个人在食堂里清好场才回去休息。遇到开会和农忙季节，她一夜惊醒几次，深怕睡过了时间。两年来，这个生产队从来没有因为吃饭晚而耽误生产。
    平日她为社员生活忙，逢年过节她更忙。今年过春节放假三天，社员都探亲访友，看戏，搞文娱活动，她却忙了三天三晚没有出厨房门。农忙时社员生产忙，料理好社员生活的后勤部也跟着一起忙。插秧双抢时，照顾社员吃好吃饱休息好，饭菜茶水都送到田间。巧做千家饭
    方喜珍同志不但不辞劳苦，苦干、实干，而且也干得巧、干得好。她开动脑筋想办法，既精打细算，又使社员吃得好、吃得饱。去年冬天，按照忙时多吃、闲时少吃的原则，用米磨成粉和菜做成菜糊，每天晚餐，每人一钵饭，一钵菜糊，每人每天能节约粮食一两五钱。社员都说这个办法很好，味道好，吃得饱，节约粮食。吃了一个多月，全食堂节约粮食二百多斤。同时还采用双蒸饭，多吃蔬菜等办法，使社员吃饱吃好。在烹调上，她更是费尽心思，尽量使菜做得味道好、花样多。萝卜、白菜、青菜、莴笋几种很平常的普通菜，经过她的巧手制作，用叶、柄、茎、菜心等不同的原料，或煎或炒或煮或红烧，经过切丝、切片、切丁等不同的刀法，辅之以卤汁、酱油、豆酱等不同的调味品，每种菜都可以做成七、八种、十几种味道不同、形状各异、营养丰富的好菜。她经手制作的坛子菜，品种更多。去年冬季就做了二百多坛，三十四种坛子菜，到现在还储有干菜、腌菜等二千三百多斤。经常是陈的没有吃完，新的又储存起来了，使社员们一年四季能吃到喷香爽口的坛子菜。
    炊事工作有很多繁重的劳动，为了提高工效，减轻体力劳动，更好地为社员生活服务，她积极地参加了炊具改革。食堂里实现了用水土自来化，纱罩盖菜自动化，切菜用切菜机，送饭送菜用滑车，淘米、量米、量水用三用机。开始切菜机齿轮不匀，转动快慢不一，送菜切菜不均匀，方喜珍和生活组长雷耀武、作业组长方圭尧一起改进了齿轮，使机器更加适用。淘米机开始做成也不大好用，经过三次改进，使机器灵活轻巧，操作方便，量水、量米准确，比手工操作提高工效三倍。
          一人能满百人意
    古话说：“一人难满百人意”，一个食堂一百多人吃饭，各人有各人的胃口，各人有各人的脾气，要做到人人满意，是一件不容易的事情。方喜珍处处关心人，态度和蔼，细心周到，打破了这个常规，做到了人人满意。两年来她没有向社员发过一次脾气，虚心听取各种意见，尽可能地满足社员的各种需要。做活的社员，不论什么时候收工回来，总能吃到热饭热菜，而且吃的菜蔬也比一般人更加丰盛。她摸透了每个人的脾气，那些人喜欢吃得咸，那些人喜欢吃得淡，青年、壮年人吃菜要炒得生，老年人就喜欢吃得软一点，烂一点的。她就按照这些要求，蒸饭时放不同的水量，炒菜时分几锅炒，吃咸的多放一些盐，吃得烂的多加一把火，使大家吃了都合口味。缺奶的小孩要量米回去搞糊糊。天晴了，社员想打一、两个人的米回去煮一餐，好有米汤浆被子衣服，她总是不厌其烦地把米量好让他们拿回去。食堂里一百多人吃饭，每一餐饭，那个没来吃，是病了，还是有事没来，她都要查问清楚。那个妇女怀了孕、那个社员胃口不好，就让他们吃一些有酸味、有辣味的坛子菜。社员有病了，老年人落雨不方便到食堂里来，他就把饭菜送到家里去。社员张连喜去年生孩子。有两个多月，方喜珍每天给她送饭送菜送茶送热水。哺乳的妇女吃酸菜缩奶，就把她们编成一席，为她们加些营养好、发奶汁的茼蒿、豆腐、菠菜。女社员李碧君的小孩缺奶，办了两三次黄花?蒸麦子给她吃。社员办喜事她热心帮忙；社员来了客人，她热情地招待。单身老人说：一辈子享不到儿女的福，如今享上了食堂的福，享了喜姑娘的福。
                一颗红心
    方喜珍是一个忠于集体事业、无限关心别人、从不考虑个人得失的人。社员说她是“连人带家”搬到了食堂，事事大公无私，只怕社员吃不好，连自己的爱人小孩都丢在一边。她日日夜夜在食堂，家里三个小孩，一个送到幼儿园，两个送进托儿所，白天很少在家里落脚，最小的才半岁，吃奶也是送到食堂里来。去年夏天怀了第三个小孩，天气炎热，吃不下饭，她不顾党支部和作业组长的劝阻，照常坚持工作，生小孩刚刚满月又回到了食堂。过春节时有个社员少分了肉，她毫不犹豫地把自己的一份让了出来。方喜珍对社员样样照顾周到，但是她从不放松对坏人坏事作斗争。她发现有人偷食堂的鸡，拿食堂的蔬菜，就和社员一道严格地批评教育了偷盗公共财产的人。那些社员吃那一类定量的饭，那些人打了米回去，她都记得一清二楚。社员反映说：“喜姑娘在这里莫乱过一桩事，那个想在她手里乱一点都乱不成。”她是这样以高度的责任心维护集体利益的。
    方喜珍是一个红色炊事员，她把一颗红心献给了公共食堂，献给了伟大的社会主义事业。
