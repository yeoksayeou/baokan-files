Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 20th: Eisenhower left South Korea tonight to return to his country, ending his nine-day thieving trip in the Far East.

He delivered a speech at the airport before boarding a plane back to the United States at around 8 p.m. local time. He vigorously touted the "strength" of the American troops invading Korea and clamored that South Korea is "a vitally important boundary for maintaining freedom."

Before leaving Seoul, Eisenhower also inspected the troops invading Korea, at a location just over ten miles from the Korean Armistice Line, and held a provocative military parade there. On the parade ground were missile weapons, atomic cannons, and many tanks that the United States had brought into South Korea in violation of the Armistice Agreement.

Eisenhower left Washington for the Far East on the 12th. Wherever he went, he was treated like a rat crossing the street, hated by everyone. His main destination was Japan, but the Japanese people slammed the door in his face. He made a fool of himself and lost face all along the way, making it the most disgraceful trip for an American president.

    硬着头皮而来　丢尽脸皮而去
    艾森豪威尔结束强盗旅行
    新华社20日讯　汉城消息：艾森豪威尔今天晚上离开南朝鲜回国，结束了他为期九天的在远东的强盗旅行。
    他在晚上当地时间八时许乘飞机返回美国前在机场上发表了一个讲话。他大肆吹嘘美国侵朝军队的“力量”，并且叫嚷说，南朝鲜是“维持自由的一条极重要的边界”。
    艾森豪威尔在离开汉城前还曾到距离朝鲜停战线不过十多英里的地方视察侵朝军队，并且在那里举行了一次挑衅性的军事检阅。在检阅场上摆着美国破坏停战协定而运入南朝鲜的导弹武器，原子大炮和许多坦克。
    艾森豪威尔是在12日离开华盛顿前来远东的。他所到之处像过街老鼠一样人人喊打。他的主要目的地是日本，但是日本人民享以闭门羹。一路上出尽丑、丢尽人，成为美国总统最不光采的一次旅行。
