Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th – News: The anti-Kishi movement within Japan's ruling party is further developing with the "natural establishment" of the new "Security Treaty."

It is reported that the Miki-Matsumura, Kono, Ishibashi, and other anti-mainstream factions held a joint meeting today, deciding to gather anti-Kishi forces within the ruling party to force the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to resign en masse before the new "Security Treaty" takes effect.

Representatives of the anti-mainstream factions reached an agreement, unanimously believing that the "authority" of the new "Security Treaty," passed under the abnormal circumstances of the opposition party members' absence, is doubtful. The agreement stated that the anti-mainstream factions demand in the agreement that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign en masse and a new cabinet dissolve the Diet so that the people can review the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The meeting decided to issue appeals to various factions within the party and broadly organize an anti-Kishi front.

The meeting also decided to hold an expanded meeting of liaison personnel tomorrow and convene a meeting of anti-mainstream leaders to further study the issue of forcing Kishi Nobusuke to step down.

These views of the anti-mainstream factions are completely different from those of Kishi Nobusuke. Kishi Nobusuke had publicly stated that his cabinet would neither resign nor dissolve the Diet before exchanging the ratification documents regarding the new "Security Treaty" with the United States.

Due to the surging development and unstoppable momentum of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle, Kishi Nobusuke's reputation has been tarnished. The Associated Press reported on the 18th that Kishi Nobusuke has "apparently become a burden" to the big capitalists who "need a stable Japan." The Associated Press also said: "Some people believe that Kishi Nobusuke has also become a burden to the United States, just like President Syngman Rhee, who had already been ousted, became a burden in South Korea." Because "Kishi Nobusuke's unpopularity among many Japanese has affected the U.S. government."

At the same time, the major Japanese bourgeois newspapers "Asahi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" both published editorials yesterday, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign immediately as a whole to ease the political crisis facing the conservative parties.

The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial said that the responsibility for the current political situation in Japan lies with the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The "Asahi Shimbun" demanded that the Kishi cabinet take the blame and resign immediately as a whole, followed by dissolving the Diet. It said that doing so now could prevent the situation from further deteriorating, and the regime would not fall into the hands of the opposition parties.

The "Asahi Shimbun" invoked the example of the collapse of the Yoshida cabinet, demanding that the members of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet immediately rise up and work for "reforming Japanese politics."

The spirit of the editorial published by the "Yomiuri Shimbun" today is exactly the same as that of the "Asahi Shimbun." It demanded that the power be kept in the hands of the Liberal Democratic Party by means of the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

### 日执政党内倒岸运动有新发展  反主流派达成协议要求岸内阁总辞职

    日执政党内倒岸运动有新发展
    反主流派达成协议要求岸内阁总辞职
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本执政党内的倒岸运动随着新“安全条约”的“自然成立”而进一步发展着。
    据报道，三木—松村、河野、石桥等反主流派今天举行联席会议，决定将汇集执政党内反岸力量，迫使岸信介内阁在新“安全条约”生效以前总辞职。
    反主流派的代表们达成协议，一致认为在反对党议员缺席的不正常情况下通过的新“安全条约”的
  “权威”是令人怀疑的。协议说，反主流派在协议中要求岸信介内阁总辞职并由新内阁来解散国会，以便由人民来审查新日美“安全条约”。会议决定要向党内各派发出呼吁，广泛地组织反岸战线。
    会议还决定将在明天举行联络人扩大会议，并召开反主流派首脑会议。进一步研究迫使岸信介下台的问题。
    反主流派的这些主张完全同岸信介的主张不同。岸信介曾经公开声称，在同美国交换关于新“安全条约”的批准书以前，他的内阁既不辞职，也不解散国会。
    由于日本人民反美反岸斗争澎湃发展，气势难当，岸信介已经声名狼借，美联社在18日说：岸信介对于“需要一个稳定的日本”的大资本家来说“显然已经变成了一个负担”。美联社还说：“某些人士认为岸信介也变成了美国的一个负担，就像已经被赶下台的总统李承晚在南朝鲜成为一个负担一样”。因为，“岸信介在许多日本人中的不得人心已经影响到了美国政府”。
    与此同时，日本资产阶级大报
  “朝日新闻”和“读卖新闻”昨天一致发表社论，要求岸信介内阁立即全体辞职，来缓和保守政党面临的政治危机。
      “朝日新闻”的社论说，目前日本政治局势演变到这种地步的责任在于岸信介内阁。
      “朝日新闻”要求岸内阁引咎立即全体辞职，接着解散国会。它说，在目前这样做能够阻止形势进一步恶化，政权也不会转到在野党手里。
      “朝日新闻”援用吉田内阁垮台时的事例，要求岸信介内阁的阁员立即起来为“革新日本政治”而努力。
      “读卖新闻”今天发表的社论的精神同“朝日新闻”的社论完全一样。它要求用岸信介内阁辞职的方法使政权继续掌握在自由民主党手里。
