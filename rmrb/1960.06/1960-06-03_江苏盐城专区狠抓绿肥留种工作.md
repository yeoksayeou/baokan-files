Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st. Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, is vigorously grasping green manure seed retention in an effort to expand the planting area of green manure crops in the autumn sowing season.

Party committees at all levels in Yancheng Prefecture have strengthened their leadership over the work of retaining seeds of green manure crops. All localities are meticulously processing and managing green manure crops like grain crops, striving for more pods and full grains. The Prefectural Committee recently held an on-site meeting on green manure seed retention in Dafeng County, allowing representatives from various places to visit and learn from the experience of the Wuxing Brigade of Yuhua Commune in the county in planting vetch on a large area to improve saline-alkali soil, as well as the operational methods of how to draw rows and set up racks in seed retention fields. Subsequently, each county also held on-site meetings in communes and brigades with better green manure planting, summarizing experience and exchanging technologies. Yancheng County summarized the successful experience of planting vetch in single-season paddy fields, and Funing County summarized the successful experience of planting vetch in wasteland, greatly breaking the superstitious ideas in expanding green manure planting, and making everyone realize that green manure crops can be planted everywhere.

    江苏盐城专区狠抓绿肥留种工作
    新华社南京31日电　江苏省盐城专区狠抓绿肥留种，力争秋播时扩大绿肥种植面积。
    盐城专区各级党委都加强了对绿肥作物留种工作的领导。各地都像对粮食作物一样精心加工管理绿肥作物，力争多结荚，子粒饱满。地委最近在大丰县召开了绿肥留种现场会议，让各地代表参观学习了这个县裕华公社五星大队大面积种植苕子改良盐碱土的经验，以及留种田怎样抽行搭架等操作方法。接着，各县也分别在绿肥种得较好的公社、大队举行现场会议，总结经验，交流技术。盐城县总结了一熟水田种苕子成功的经验，阜宁县总结了在荒田种苕子成功的经验，大大破除了扩种绿肥中的迷信思想，使大家认识到绿肥作物到处可种。
