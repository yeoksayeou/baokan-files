Massed Artillery Fires Bombard the "God of Plague"
Fujian Front Roars with Earth-Shaking Cannon Fire, Unleashing a Powerful Anti-American Storm

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 17th—The powerful artillery forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, at 8:00 PM tonight, conducted an anti-American demonstration bombardment against the islands of Greater Kinmen, Lesser Kinmen, Greater Tan, and Lesser Tan, entrenched by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The earth-shaking roar of cannons unleashed a powerful anti-American storm in the Taiwan Strait.

Before the firing, the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front Broadcasting Station broadcast the Front Headquarters' "Message to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," pointing out: This bombardment is entirely for demonstrating against U.S. imperialism, to support the just struggle of the Asian people against Eisenhower's bandit-like tour, to support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit-like tour, and to express the great Chinese people's contempt and scorn for Eisenhower.

At the artillery positions on the Fujian Front, the heroic artillery soldiers of the motherland and the heroic militia who participated in the war all went into action. At the order, in an instant, ten thousand cannons roared, and countless streaks of light tore through the night sky over the Taiwan Strait. The heroes shouted with fervor: "Eisenhower, get out, fire!" "American aggressors, get out of Taiwan, fire!" "Get out of Japan, fire!" "Get out of Korea, fire!" "Get out of Asia, fire!" "We must liberate our national territory of Taiwan, fire!" The angry artillery fire fell on Kinmen Island like a torrential rain.

The heroic Fujian Front army and civilians, enraged by the U.S. warmonger Eisenhower's criminal activities in Asia to plot new wars and antagonize the Chinese people, held rallies and forums today to strongly condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and express a solemn protest to the "God of Plague" Eisenhower, who is on his way to Taiwan, and to the American aggressors. They said that the Chinese people oppose the war-monger Eisenhower coming to Taiwan! The Chinese people will never give up until the American aggressors get out of Taiwan!

As of dispatch time, the anti-American demonstration bombardment is still continuing.
