Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Beijing Municipal organizations of various democratic parties jointly held a rally tonight, warmly supporting the armed anti-American demonstration of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops shelling Jinmen.

Su Congzhou, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: Serve the “guests” with the right dishes. We use artillery to "welcome and send off" Eisenhower and let this chieftain of the American imperialist robbers tremble in the thunderous roar!

Wu Han, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Every word of the letter from the Fujian Front Command of the People's Liberation Army to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu represents our will. Now that the American imperialists' running dogs, Syngman Rhee and Menderes, have been driven off the stage by the people, and the Japanese people have given Eisenhower the cold shoulder, this further proves that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and its days of rampant bullying will not last long.

Pu Jiexiu, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: Eisenhower's robber trip fully proves that the nature of imperialism will not change. American imperialism will surely be driven back to its old home by the people of Asia.

Chen Xuan'shan, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: Eisenhower, this negative teacher, will not get any results from his "visit" to Asia this time, except to arouse greater indignation among the Asian people against American imperialism and further expose its robber face in front of the people of the world.

Wang Renxuan, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Yan Jici, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Jiusan Society, Liu Jinhan, Member of the Beijing Municipal Preparatory Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, and Wang Wande, representative of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, also spoke at the meeting. Wang Wande said that the Taiwan compatriots have always loved the motherland and firmly opposed imperialism, and they have never regarded American imperialism as human beings. He said: The letter from the Fujian Front Command to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu pointed out the direction of the struggle for the people of Taiwan, and the artillery fire from the Fujian Front made the Taiwan compatriots see how powerful the motherland is, which greatly encouraged the Taiwan compatriots. He then severely condemned the American imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He said that the people of Taiwan will fight against American imperialist aggression and shatter any conspiracy to separate Taiwan from the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Women's Federation held rallies today, firmly supporting the "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" issued by the Fujian Front Command of the People's Liberation Army.

At the rally held by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Peng Siming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, said that more than one million workers in Beijing firmly support our army's shelling of Kinmen to hold armed anti-American demonstrations. He said that American imperialism is conspiring to create "two Chinas" and attempting to turn Taiwan into its colony. The workers of Beijing express serious protest against this! We want to warn Eisenhower: your conspiracy will never succeed, and you must pay back this debt you owe to the Chinese people. Cao Yucheng, leader of the iron smelting furnace section of the Beijing Steel Plant and an advanced producer in the city, Zheng Enhong, technician of the Xingping Machinery Factory and a national advanced producer, and others unanimously stated in their speeches: Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan is a provocation to the 650 million people of our country. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and must drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.

At the rally held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Zhang Jinlin, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: "Eisenhower's robber trip to Taiwan is an open provocation to the people of our country. Aggressors must be resolutely打击 (dǎ jī - strike). The artillery fire from the Fujian Front is good, and the youth of our capital firmly support it." He said: "Mountains can be moved, seas can be filled, our determination to liberate Taiwan will not change, and the youth of Beijing will resolutely unite with the people of the whole country to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and the expulsion of American imperialism."

Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, spoke first at the rally held by the Beijing Women's Federation tonight, expressing her firm support for the just struggle of the people of Asian countries and patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip. She said: "The great Chinese people must resolutely crush the American imperialist dream of turning our territory of Taiwan into an American colony! We must liberate Taiwan!" Tang Shuzhen, director of the Jianguomen Gold Lacquer Inlay Factory, and Xian Yuting, director of the Donghuamen Section Ku Houxiang Nursery, also spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their firm support for the letter from the Fujian Front Command to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and expressed their determination to fight to the end against American imperialist aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and local organizations of various democratic parties held a rally today, strongly condemning the "plague god" Eisenhower's robber trip and warmly supporting the armed anti-American demonstration of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops. They unanimously stated: They will not give up until the American aggressors are driven out of Taiwan.

Zhao Zukang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The artillery fire from the Jinmen Front is the artillery fire supporting the just anti-American struggle of the people of Asian countries, the artillery fire supporting the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip, and the artillery fire expressing the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower." He severely condemned the American imperialist crime of occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and pointed out that Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan was to further create tension in the Taiwan Strait region; at the same time, he was playing the conspiracy of so-called "two Chinas" to strengthen control over the Chiang Kai-shek group and prepare for American imperialism to further occupy Taiwan for a long time. However, this attempt is nothing more than a daydream of American imperialism. The powerful Chinese people are fully capable of crushing this conspiracy. We must drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

Xie Xuetang, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan was full of gunpowder and once again exposed the fierce face of American imperialism in continuing to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, creating "two Chinas," and resolutely antagonizing the people of our country. He said: American imperialism has never been well-intentioned. The Chinese people will not forget that on June 27, ten years ago, American imperialism openly dispatched the Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy our country's territory of Taiwan while launching the war of aggression against Korea, turning our beautiful treasure island into a hell on earth. Ten years of painful history have educated the people of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan understand that the American imperialist occupation of Taiwan is the root of all suffering and disasters. To get rid of all this suffering, they can only wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors, drive American imperialism out of Taiwan, and return to the embrace of the great motherland. In recent years, the Taiwanese people's anti-American and patriotic struggle has never stopped, and anti-American sentiment has been rising. No matter what tricks Eisenhower plays in Taiwan, he can never change the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The people of Taiwan must unite closely with the people of the motherland and resolutely fight to the end to drive out American imperialism and liberate Taiwan.

Liao Shicheng, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country's territory, and we will never allow American imperialism to play the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas." Eisenhower's criminal activities in Taiwan can only arouse greater anger towards American imperialism among all the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. He said: All members of the Shanghai organization of the China Democratic League firmly support the letter issued by the Fujian Front Command of the People's Liberation Army to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip.

Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The just action of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops shelling Jinmen and holding an armed anti-American demonstration expressed the fighting will of the 650 million people of the whole country to resolutely oppose American imperialism, and greatly encouraged and supported the just struggle of the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu and the people of Asia against American imperialism. Eisenhower's robber trip this time has further played the role of a negative teacher for the people of the world, fully demonstrating that the aggressive nature of American imperialism will never change. The current situation in the world is that the strength of socialism exceeds the strength of imperialism, and the awakening strength of the people of all countries exceeds the strength of reaction. The days of imperialism are numbered.

Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: We must wage a resolute struggle against imperialist robbers. The People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops shelling Jinmen is a head-on blow to the robber chieftain Eisenhower. This artillery fire warns American imperialism that if it dares to impose war on the heads of the Chinese people, the Chinese people will mercilessly retaliate against it.

Zhou Gucheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Lu Yudao, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Jiusan Society, and Cao Hongzhu, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, unanimously pointed out in their speeches: American imperialism must get out of Taiwan. All conspiracies to create "two Chinas" will surely be completely defeated. The Chinese people are determined to recover our country's territory of Taiwan, will never forgive the crimes of American imperialism, and every debt that American imperialism owes us will eventually be paid in full.

The rally was presided over by Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC. Famous people from all walks of life in Shanghai attended the rally.

    新华社18日讯　各民主党派北京市组织今天晚上联合举行集会，热烈拥护和支持中国人民解放军福建前线部队炮击金门的反美大示威。
    中国国民党革命委员会北京市委员会副主任委员苏从周说：待什么“客”用什么菜，我们用大炮来“迎送”艾森豪威尔，让美帝国主义这个强盗头子在这震天雷声中发抖罢！
    中国民主同盟北京市委员会主任委员吴晗说：人民解放军福建前线司令部告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书的每个字都代表了我们的意志。现在美帝国主义在亚洲的走狗李承晚、曼德列斯都被人民赶下了台，日本人民又使艾森豪威尔吃了闭门羹，这更进一步证明美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，它横行霸道的日子不会很长了。
    中国民主建国会北京市委员会主任委员浦洁修说：艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行充分证明帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。美帝国主义一定会被亚洲人民赶回它的老家去。
    中国民主促进会北京市委员会副主任委员陈选善说：艾森豪威尔这个反面教员这次“访问”亚洲，除了激起亚洲人民对美帝国主义的更大愤慨并且在全世界人民面前进一步暴露了它的强盗面目之外，是得不到任何结果的。
    中国农工民主党北京市委员会主任委员王人旋、九三学社北京市委员会主任委员严济慈、中国致公党北京市筹备委员会委员刘锦汉、台湾民主同盟北京市支部代表王万德等都在会上讲了话。王万德说，台湾同胞一贯热爱祖国，坚决反对帝国主义，他们从来不把美帝国主义当人看。他说：福建前线司令部告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书给台湾人民指出了斗争的方向，福建前线的炮声使台湾同胞看到了祖国的力量是多么强大，使台湾同胞受到极大的鼓舞。他接着严厉谴责了美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，台湾人民将为反对美帝国主义的侵略、粉碎把台湾从祖国割裂出去的任何阴谋而斗争。
    新华社18日讯　北京市总工会、共青团北京市委员会、北京市妇女联合会今天分别举行集会，坚决拥护人民解放军福建前线司令部发表的“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”。
    在北京市总工会举行的集会上，北京市总工会副主席彭思明说，北京市的一百多万职工坚决支持我军炮轰金门举行反美武装示威。他说，美帝国主义阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图使台湾沦为它的殖民地，北京市职工对此表示严重抗议！我们要警告艾森豪威尔：你的阴谋鬼计永远不会得逞，你欠中国人民的这笔账是一定要还的。北京钢厂化铁炉工段段长、市先进生产者曹玉成，兴平机械厂技师、全国先进生产者郑恩洪等在发言中一致认为：艾森豪威尔到台湾的“访问”是对我国六亿五千万人民的挑衅。中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要把美帝国主义从台湾赶出去。
    在共青团北京市委举行的集会上，共青团北京市委第二书记张进霖说：“艾森豪威尔这次来台湾进行强盗旅行，是对我国人民的公开挑衅，对侵略者必须予以坚决打击，福建前线的炮打得好，我们首都青年坚决支持。”他说：“山可移，海可填，我们解放台湾的决心不变，北京市青年坚决和全国人民一道，为解放台湾、赶走美帝国主义而斗争到底。”
    北京市妇联主任张晓梅在北京市妇联今晚举行的集会上首先发言，她表示坚决支持亚洲各国人民和台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。她说：“伟大的中国人民一定要坚决粉碎美帝国主义企图把我国领土台湾沦为美国殖民地的梦想！我们一定要解放台湾！”建国门金漆镶嵌厂厂长唐淑珍、东华门段库后巷托儿所所长线玉亭等也在会上讲了话，她们都表示坚决拥护福建前线司令部的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，并且表示要为反对美帝国主义的侵略而斗争到底。
    新华社上海18日电　政协上海市委员会和各民主党派上海市地方组织的负责人今天举行集会，强烈谴责“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，热烈拥护中国人民解放军福建前线部队的反美武装大示威。他们一致表示：不把美国侵略者赶出台湾，誓不罢休。
    民革上海市委员会主任委员赵祖康说：“金门前线的炮声，是支持亚洲各国人民反美正义斗争的炮声，是支持台、澎、金、马同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的炮声，是表示伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视的炮声。”他严厉谴责了美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的罪行，并且指出：艾森豪威尔台湾之行是为了进一步制造台湾海峡地区的紧张局势；同时，玩弄所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，来加强对蒋介石集团的控制，并为美帝国主义进一步长期霸占台湾作准备。但是，这种企图不过是美帝国主义白日作梦罢了，强大的中国人民完全有力量粉碎这种阴谋。我们一定要把美国侵略者赶出台湾。
    台盟上海市支部主任委员谢雪堂说：艾森豪威尔这次台湾之行充满了火药味，再一次暴露了美帝国主义继续霸占我国领土台湾、制造“两个中国”和坚决与我国人民为敌的凶恶面貌。他说：美帝国主义向来是不怀好意的。中国人民不会忘记十年前的6月27日美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，公然派遣第七舰队侵占了我国的领土台湾，使我国这个美丽的宝岛变成了人间地狱。十年来的惨痛历史教育了台湾人民。台湾人民懂得：美帝国主义霸占台湾，是一切痛苦和灾难的根源。要摆脱这一切痛苦，只有和美国侵略者进行坚决的斗争，把美帝国主义赶出台湾，回到伟大祖国的怀抱。几年来，台湾人民反美爱国斗争从未间断，反美情绪日益高涨。不论艾森豪威尔到台湾耍什么花招，都决不能改变中国人民解放台湾的坚决意志。台湾人民一定同祖国人民紧密团结在一起，为赶走美帝国主义、为解放台湾坚决斗争到底。
    民盟上海市委副主任委员廖世承说：台湾是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我们决不容许美帝国主义玩弄制造“两个中国”的阴谋。艾森豪威尔到台湾的罪恶活动，只能激起包括台湾人民在内的全中国人民对美帝国主义更大的愤怒。他说：民盟上海组织的全体成员，坚决拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部发表的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。
    上海市工商联主任委员盛丕华说：中国人民解放军福建前线部队炮轰金门、举行反美武装大示威的正义行动，表达了全国六亿五千万人民坚决反对美帝国主义的斗争意志，极大地鼓舞和支持了台、澎、金、马同胞和亚洲人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行，对全世界人民进一步起了反面教员的作用，充分说明了美帝国主义的侵略本性是决不会改变的。现在世界的形势是社会主义力量超过了帝国主义的力量，各国人民觉醒的力量超过了反动的力量。帝国主义的寿命不长了。
    政协上海市委员会副主席、民建上海市委副主任委员胡厥文说：对帝国主义强盗，我们必须和它进行坚决的斗争。人民解放军福建前线部队炮轰金门，就是给强盗头子艾森豪威尔的一个当头棒喝。这炮声警告美帝国主义，如果胆敢把战争强加于中国人民的头上，中国人民将毫不留情地给它狠狠地还击。
    农工民主党上海市委主任委员周谷城、九三学社上海分社主任委员卢于道、民进上海市委副主任委员曹鸿翥在发言中一致指出：美帝国主义必须滚出台湾去。一切制造“两个中国”的阴谋一定遭到彻底的失败。中国人民坚决要收复我国的领土台湾，决不饶恕美帝国主义的罪行，美帝国主义欠我们的每一笔债，最后都要还清。
