Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: “Heighten vigilance” and “Be ready at any moment to give the imperialist aggressors a devastating blow”—this is the oath that the Soviet working people and Soviet soldiers continue to express.

In the past two days, Soviet working people and officers and soldiers of the armed forces have continued to hold rallies or write letters to newspapers condemning the US imperialists' aggression against the Soviet Union and their crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

At a meeting of workers at the Moscow Machine Tool Foundry, worker Yazhinov said that the US imperialists are trying to launch a new war. They do not want disarmament and peace, so they sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference and hindered the relaxation of the international climate. Voynov, the production captain of the mechanical assembly workshop, said that we have strived and will continue to strive for lasting peace among the people of all countries, but our country is always ready to give the shameless imperialists a devastating counterattack. At the end of the workers' meeting at this factory, a resolution was passed stating that the Soviet Union is now stronger than ever, and no conspiracy by the enemies of peace can stop us from advancing towards communism.

    The United States' Provocations Cannot Scare Us, We Have the Strength to Punish the Aggressors
At a meeting of workers at the No. 8 oilfield of the Baku "Lenin Oil Enterprise", workers said in their speeches that the US ruling groups who sabotaged the summit conference were shameless. They also expressed their indignation at the United Nations Security Council's rejection of the Soviet proposal to condemn US acts of aggression. The workers expressed that they will work harder in the future to increase the power of the motherland so that they can deal a devastating blow to any attack by the aggressors at any time.

Officers and soldiers of a unit of the Soviet Pacific Fleet held a rally on May 30. Captain Mikhailik said at the meeting that the provocative acts of the US imperialists cannot scare us. We have the strength to punish the aggressors completely. Sergeant Tambaobutsev said that imperialism is provoking the Soviet Union, which requires us to maintain combat readiness and master military technology better. He said that the motherland has given us powerful weapons, and we must always give the instigators of a new war the response they deserve.

    U.S. Imperialism Vainly Attempts to Dominate the World; Their Fate Will Be More Miserable Than Hitler's
Sakabayev, a technician at the Ashgabat Glass Manufacturing United Factory, wrote a letter to "Labor News" saying that the US rulers' treacherous policy towards the Soviet Union has aroused great indignation among the Soviet people. The US imperialists only hypocritically talk about disarmament and friendship, but in reality, they are engaged in activities that exacerbate international tensions. They have forgotten Hitler's fate and vainly attempt to dominate the world. If they dare to violate the powerful socialist camp, then their fate will be more tragic than Hitler's.

Lieutenant Colonel Baodarenko of a certain unit of the Soviet Air Force published a statement in "Soviet Air Force News" yesterday, saying that the head of the Soviet government has once again provided conclusive evidence exposing the conspiracy of the US imperialists and called on all Soviet people to remain vigilant. This call is especially important for us Soviet soldiers. He said that the Soviet Union has enough power to fight back against anyone who puts pressure on us. We will continue to shoot down American spy planes. Raising vigilance is the sacred duty of each and every one of us.

    Soviet Rockets Can Shatter Enemy Aircraft in the High Skies and Not Let a Single Robber Enter Soviet Skies
During training breaks, a certain Air Force fighter unit discussed Khrushchev's speech in groups. Air Force Major Babiyi said in the discussion that Comrade Khrushchev was right, our skies will never allow hostile aircraft to intrude. Air Force Captain Kostyuk said that the US imperialists can no longer rely on its strategic bombers. Soviet rockets can shatter enemy aircraft at altitudes above 20,000 meters, so that not even a single American bomber can enter Soviet airspace.

Soviet hero and Navy Major General Balyangin published an article in "Soviet Navy News" saying that the US ruling groups hate the Soviet Union and are carrying out various provocations against us. We will more vigorously strengthen the national defense of the socialist motherland so that no provocation by US imperialism can prevent our people from advancing towards communism.

Representatives of the Moscow Military District Air Defense Forces held a meeting on the 1st. The representatives of various units unanimously stated in their speeches that as a response to the aggressive provocations of US imperialism, the fighters of the Air Defense Forces will stand more vigilantly at their posts, not letting a single robber enter Soviet skies. Private Gainachuk said that the Party, the government, and the people have given us advanced military equipment, and we will strive to master this equipment. Colonel Luchiangchuk published a statement in "Red Star News" saying that as an old officer, I will soon retire, but I do not want to sit idle, I want to devote myself to communist construction and strengthen the national defense of the motherland.

    苏联官兵和劳动人民继续集会谴责美帝国主义
    增强祖国威力随时准备痛击美国侵略者
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　“提高警惕”、“随时准备好给帝国主义侵略者以毁灭性的打击”——这是苏联劳动人民和苏联军人继续表示的誓言。
    这两天来，苏联劳动人民和武装部队的官兵继续举行集会，或给报纸写信，谴责美帝国主义对苏联的侵略活动和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。
    在莫斯科机床铸造厂的职工集会上，工人雅齐诺夫说，美帝国主义企图发动新战争，他们不愿意裁军和和平，因此破坏了四国政府首脑会议，阻挠国际气候的缓和。机械装配车间生产队长沃依诺夫说，我们过去和现在都争取各国人民之间的持久和平，但是，我国随时准备给厚颜无耻的帝国主义者以毁灭性的回击。这个工厂的工人集会最后通过决议说，苏联现在比任何时候都更加强大，和平的敌人的任何阴谋都阻挡不住我们向共产主义前进。
    美国的挑衅吓不倒我们  我们有力量惩罚侵略者
    在巴库“列宁石油企业”第八采油场工人的集会上，工人们在发言中认为，破坏政府首脑会议的美国统治集团无耻。他们对联合国安全理事会否决苏联提出的关于谴责美国侵略行为的提案，也感到十分愤慨。工人们表示，他们今后要更好地劳动，增加祖国的威力，以便随时给侵略者的任何进攻以毁灭性的打击。
    苏联太平洋舰队某部官兵5月30日举行了集会。上尉米哈伊里克在会上说，美帝国主义的挑衅行为吓不倒我们。我们完全有力量惩罚侵略者。上士塔姆包布采夫说，帝国主义对苏联进行挑衅，这要求我们保持战斗准备，更好地掌握军事技术。他说，祖国把强有力的武器交给了我们，我们要随时给新战争挑拨者以应有的回击。
    美帝国主义妄图统治全世界  他们的命运将比希特勒更惨
    阿什哈巴德玻璃制造联合工厂技师萨卡巴耶夫写信给“劳动报”说，美国统治者对苏联背信弃义的政策，激起了苏联人民极大的愤慨。美帝国主义只是伪善地空谈裁军和友谊，而实际上却干着加剧国际紧张局势的勾当。他们忘记了希特勒的下场，妄图统治世界。如果他们胆敢侵犯强大的社会主义阵营，那么，他们的命运将比希特勒更加悲惨。
    苏联空军某部中校鲍达连科昨天在“苏联空军报”上发表谈话说，苏联政府首脑再一次证据确凿地揭露了美帝国主义者的阴谋，并且号召全体苏联人民保持警惕。这一号召对我们苏联军人来说尤其重要。他说，苏联有足够的力量来回击任何对我们施加压力的人。我们将继续打击美国间谍飞机。提高警惕性，这是我们每一个人的神圣义务。
   苏联火箭能在高空粉碎敌机  不让一个强盗闯进苏联天空
    某空军歼击机部队利用训练的间歇时间分组讨论了赫鲁晓夫的讲话。空军少校巴比伊在讨论中说，赫鲁晓夫同志说得很对，我们的天空永远不允许敌对的飞机闯进来。空军上尉科斯杜克说，美帝国主义者现在再依靠不成它的战略轰炸机了。苏联火箭能够在两万米以上高空粉碎敌机，这样一来，就连一架美国轰炸机也不能够闯进苏联领空。
    苏联英雄、海军少将巴梁金在“苏联海军报”发表文章说，美国统治集团憎恨苏联，他们对我们进行各种挑衅。我们将更加有力地加强社会主义祖国的国防力量，使美帝国主义的任何挑衅都不能妨碍我国人民向共产主义前进。
    莫斯科军区防空部队的代表们1日举行了集会。各单位的代表们在发言中一致表示，作为对美帝国主义侵略挑衅的回答，防空部队的战士们将更加警觉地站在自己的岗位上，不让一个强盗闯进苏联天空。上等兵盖纳丘克说，党、政府和人民把完善的军事装备交给我们，我们将努力掌握这些装备。上校卢强丘克在“红星报”上发表谈话说，我作为一个老军官，很快就要退役，但是，我不想闲坐着，我要致力于共产主义建设，加强祖国的国防力量。
