	Good "Gardener"
	Xie Yi
	Our teachers are gardeners in the field of culture and education. Under the leadership and education of the Party, they stick to their posts, regardless of sun and rain, or wind and snow. They work hard to cultivate the soil, water the plants, prune the branches, and graft new ones. With their diligent support, millions of buds are constantly growing stronger, and hundreds of old trees are joyfully sprouting new shoots.
	Facing the magnificent scenery of this garden full of spring, we cherish and admire those selfless gardeners.
	In the continuous mountains of Guizhou, there is a sixteen-year-old female teacher named Gao Yongxian at Yezhutang Minban Primary School in Bijie County. Every day after school, she runs to a primary school more than ten miles away to "learn from experience." At night, when there is no kerosene, she holds a burning sunflower stalk in her left hand and a pen in her right hand to prepare lessons in the dim light.
	In Yazhukeng, Ningguo County, Anhui, Minban teacher Zhou Benwang is always the first to arrive at the school after dinner, sweeping the floor, wiping the dust, moving desks and chairs, and turning the school clean. After class, when people are gone, he takes his textbooks to ask primary school teachers to help him prepare for the next day's lessons.
	On the vast grasslands of Balin Right Banner and Keshiketeng Banner in Inner Mongolia, correspondence teacher Meng Baoshan had to rush to Baiyinaobao, 150 li away, for face-to-face instruction. Only one day before the class was to begin, it suddenly started to rain heavily. He advanced through the rain, his clothes soaked through, and he lost his way. A large river lay in front of him, the water rising and flowing rapidly, but he disregarded everything and groped his way across the river, finally finding his destination without delaying his lessons.
	Throughout the motherland, whether in remote mountainous areas and secluded villages, or in the streets and alleys of towns, there are countless gardeners engaged in education, working with enthusiasm. They want to plant the most brilliant flowers in remote and barren areas, and draw the most beautiful pictures on blank paper.
	Countless gardeners engaged in education have grown up under the Party's cultivation and education. They have studied Mao Zedong Thought and mastered Mao Zedong Thought, so they have the ability to turn wilderness into flower gardens. When you are walking on the green grass path, resting under the elegant flowering trees, do you ever think that this place used to be a bald hill and wasteland, overgrown with weeds, but now? It is full of flowers and lush trees. This is what the gardeners have created with their own big hands and hoes, according to a magnificent and beautiful plan. Many of our teachers are like this too. In the beginning, there were no school buildings and no desks and chairs. Relying on a red heart and a few pieces of chalk, they worked hard under the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, starting from scratch, from small to large, and soon created a situation with a considerable scale and a promising future. Diligent sowing, ten thousand trees into shade, the seeds of culture were sown soon, and many places ended the history of using beans to keep accounts, and many people also mastered scientific weapons and were able to further uncover the mysteries of nature. These are the achievements created by thousands of educators under the leadership and education of the Party, displaying a communist spirit.
	Gardeners also have the ability to gild the lily. A good gardener knows flowers, plants, and trees as well as he knows his own fingers. He can use methods such as pruning and hybridization to allow different flowers and trees to develop and grow under the same soil and climate, so that our garden is full of flowers and adds infinite beauty. Teachers are like those gardeners, educating our new generation to grow up healthier, making students better and better, just like gilding the lily. They can not only lead students to stride forward on the broad and flat road, but also lead them to cut through thorns, climb steep walls, cross deep valleys, and climb the peak of culture and science more quickly. He is a gardener, he keeps opening up broad roads, so that the next generation can move forward smoothly, he not only uses his strength and wisdom, but also uses the collective wisdom, in every possible way, to make the seedlings grow rapidly, and continuously cultivate outstanding builders for communism.

    好“园丁”
    谢逸
    我们的教师是文化教育领域里的园丁，他们在党的领导和教育下坚守着自己的岗位，不管日晒雨淋，还是风吹雪打，都一样艰苦地培土浇水，剪枝嫁接；在他们辛勤扶持之下，万万千千颗蓓蕾不断地茁长壮大，成千成百株老树也欣欣然抽出了新芽。
    面对这满园春色的绚丽景况，我们怀念和敬仰着那些忘我的园丁。
    在群山连绵的贵州，毕节县野猪塘民办小学有一个十六岁的女教师，名叫高永先，每天放学后跑到十多里外的小学去“取经”；晚上没有煤油，便左手拿起燃着的葵花秆，右手拿着钢笔在暗淡的火光下备课。
    在安徽宁国县压竹坑，民校教师周本旺每天吃过晚饭，都第一个赶到学校，扫地、擦灰、搬桌椅、点灯，把学校弄得干干净净。下课以后，人走散了，他又拿着课本去请小学教师帮助他备第二天的功课。
    在内蒙古巴林右旗和克什克腾辽阔的草原上，函授教师孟宝山要赶到一百五十里外的白音敖包去面授，只差一天就是上课时间了，突然下起大雨来，他冒雨前进，衣服湿透，还迷失了方向，一条大河横在他的面前，水涨流急，但他不顾一切地摸索过河，终于找到了目的地，没有耽误功课。
    在祖国各地，无论是边远的山区僻乡，还是城镇里的街头巷尾，都有着数不尽的从事教育工作的园丁，在热忱地工作着，他们要在穷乡僻壤种出最灿烂的鲜花，在白纸上画出最美丽的图画。
    无数的从事教育工作的园丁，在党的培养和教育下成长起来，他们学习了毛泽东思想，掌握了毛泽东思想，于是他们就有着使荒野变成花圃的本领。当你在绿草如茵的路上散步，在幽雅的花树脚下休息的时候，你是否想得到，从前这地方原是秃岭荒原，野草丛生，而今呢？却是花团锦簇、翠树成林了。这就是园丁们按照一个雄伟美丽的计划，用自己的一双大手、一把锄头创造出来的。我们的许多教师也正是这样，当初没有校舍，没有桌椅，就凭着一颗红心，几枝粉笔，在党的领导和群众支持下大干特干，从无到有、从小到大，不久就创出了一个规模不小、前程远大的局面。辛勤播种，万树成荫，文化的种子撒播不久，许多地方就结束了用豆子记账的历史，不少人还掌握了科学利器，能进一步地去启揭大自然的奥秘。这些，就是千千万万教育工作者在党的领导和教育下，发挥共产主义风格创造出来的成绩。
    园丁，还有着锦上添花的本领。一个好园丁，他像熟悉自己的掌指一样地熟悉花草林木，他可以用剪枝杂交等方法，让不同的花木在相同的土壤气候下发育生长，从而使我们的园地百花盛开，增添无限的美丽。教师们也像那些园丁一样，教育我们新的一代更加健康地成长起来，使学生们好了更好，犹如锦上添花。他们不仅能够领着学生们在康庄平坦的大路上阔步前进，还能够带领他们斩荆辟棘，爬陡壁，越深谷，更快地攀登文化科学高峰。他是园丁，他不停地开辟着广阔的道路，好让后一代顺利地大步前进，他不但应用自己的气力和智慧，还运用集体的智慧，千方百计，使幼苗迅速成长，源源不断地为共产主义培养出优秀的建设者。
