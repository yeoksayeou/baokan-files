Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Sun Jingqiao, a student from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, recently set a world record for the straight-line distance of piston-powered helicopter model aircraft flight with a score of 91.5 kilometers in an aviation model record-breaking flight test held in Beijing.

On the morning of May 18, with a ground wind speed of one to two and clear weather, after the judging panel announced that the helicopter model aircraft had passed the inspection, at 5:17, the model aircraft smoothly ascended into the sky from the northwestern suburbs of Beijing and flew in a southeasterly direction. Later, the model aircraft was found by commune members of the Wujiayao Village of the Houyi People's Commune in Ba County, Tianjin, on a sandy area, and they notified Beijing. After measurement, the straight-line distance between the model aircraft and the take-off point reached 91.5 kilometers, setting a new world record. Piston-powered helicopter model aircraft activities are still a relatively young national defense sports activity in our country. In April last year, Liu Litian, an aviation model athlete in our country, set a world record of 18.038 kilometers for the straight-line distance of piston-powered model aircraft flight. Later, the Soviet athlete Borisov surpassed Liu Litian's record with a score of 21.5 kilometers, but this time Sun Jingqiao broke the world record in this event with an even newer score.

Sun Jingqiao, 23, is a third-year student at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. He began participating in aviation model activities in middle school. In April of this year, he joined the piston-powered helicopter model aircraft group of the Institute's aviation model sports team. Under the education of the Party and the help of the group, he overcame many difficulties and finally achieved excellent results.

    创活塞式模型飞机飞行世界纪录
    新华社10日讯　北京航空学院学生孙景桥，最近在北京举行的一次航空模型创纪录飞行测验中，以九十一点五公里的成绩创造了活塞式直升模型飞机飞行直线距离的世界纪录。
    5月18日清晨，地面风速为一至二级，天气晴朗，当裁判组宣布直升模型飞机审查合格后，五点十七分，这架模型飞机从北京西北郊平稳地升入天空，并向东南方向飞去。后来，模型飞机被天津市坝县后奕人民公社武家窑村的社员在一块沙地上发现，才转通知北京。经过测定，模型飞机离起飞点直线距离达到九十一点五公里，创造了世界新纪录。活塞式直升模型飞机活动，在我国还是比较年轻的国防体育活动项目之一。去年4月间，我国航空模型选手刘立天就曾经创造了活塞式模型飞机飞行直线距离十八点零三八公里的世界纪录。后来，苏联选手鲍利索夫曾经以二十一点五公里的成绩超过刘立天的纪录，但这次孙景桥又以更新的成绩刷新了这一项目的世界纪录。
    二十三岁的孙景桥是北京航空学院三年级学生。他在中学时就开始参加航空模型活动。今年4月间，他参加了学院航空模型运动队活塞式直升模型飞机小组。在党的教育和小组的帮助下，他克服重重困难，终于创造了优异成绩。
