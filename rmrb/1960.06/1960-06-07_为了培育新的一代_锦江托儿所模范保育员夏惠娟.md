    To Nurture a New Generation
    ——Xia Huijuan, Model Childcare Worker at Jinjiang Nursery
    Our Correspondent Chen Wanwen
    “If Xia Xiaolin can be raised, even a hammer would sprout!” Some people in Jinjiang Village, Fumei People's Commune, Shuangshui County, used to say this. But this saying did not come true. The nursery raised Xia Xiaolin. Now he is strong and nimble, and already over three years old.
    Xia Xiaolin lost his mother seven months after birth. His father specially hired an old aunt to take care of him. This old aunt was afraid that the child would be hungry, and always fed him things. In less than a month, Xia Xiaolin's stomach was ruined, and he was so thin that he was just skin and bones. Many people who saw him couldn't help but shake their heads, saying the child definitely wouldn't survive.
    Seeing this situation, Xia Huijuan, the director of the Jinjiang Nursery, and the childcare workers were extremely saddened. They repeatedly pleaded with Xiaolin's father: "Leave the child to us, we will raise him well." Xiaolin's father saw that these childcare workers were all young girls, and thought: Even the experienced old aunt couldn't raise him well, can they do it? But seeing Xiaolin so thin, he had no choice but to send Xiaolin to the nursery with a try-it-and-see attitude.
    On the day Xia Xiaolin entered the nursery, some people were discussing it, saying that this time the nursery was inviting trouble upon itself. Xia Huijuan's mother originally disagreed with her daughter being a childcare worker. Hearing this news, she rushed to the nursery and pulled at her daughter, saying: "What will you do if you ruin someone else's child?" The Party Branch Secretary heard the people's discussions and ran to the nursery to see what was going on. He praised the childcare workers' spirit and courage in nurturing a new generation. He asked them what difficulties they had. The childcare workers said: "We are not afraid of any difficulties, we are just afraid of too much public discussion." The Branch Secretary said: "Then you should use the facts to convince the people and strive for greater trust from the people!"
    Because Xia Xiaolin had chronic diarrhea and excessive water loss, he suffered a convulsive shock not many days after entering the nursery. Although Xia Huijuan had received training in healthcare work and had some first-aid knowledge, she had not been through practice after all, and her mood was a little disturbed. But she thought of overcoming difficulties and calmly applied first aid according to the emergency procedures. Before the doctor arrived, she revived Xia Xiaolin. The doctor pointed out that to keep Xia Xiaolin alive, he needed careful care, especially attention to his diet and daily life. After careful study, the nursery formulated a care plan for Xiaolin. At that time, the children in the nursery were all day-care, but Xia Xiaolin was exceptionally accepted as full-time care, and all education and care work was taken over by the nursery. The childcare workers fed him thin porridge regularly, treated his sores, and cared for his sleep, adding or removing clothes, and paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. Xia Xiaolin's life became regular, and he stopped having diarrhea. He slowly recovered his health and grew stronger and stronger.
    Xia Xiaolin's example gave all the childcare workers great inspiration and good training. They realized that they must further improve the work of the nursery in order to comprehensively educate and care for the children. They could no longer remain at the level of just wiping the children's noses, pulling their stools, and holding them to urinate. Childcare work must comprehensively care for children in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. But how should they carry out this work well? Then let's learn. They decided to learn one thing and do one thing. The nursery sent childcare workers to commune and county childcare worker training classes in batches to study. When they were learning from the advanced experience of others, they learned that isolation rooms, children's toilets, etc., were indispensable basic constructions for nurseries. They then used their evening rest time to dismantle dilapidated houses and take old materials to build them. One night, they took advantage of the moonlight and went out to build a wall, creating a sunbathing place for the children. The wall was built, but the next day it was seen that the slope was very large, as if it was about to collapse. They were not discouraged. After the second and third reconstructions, it was either high on one side and low on the other, or it was curved like a dragon. It was not until the fourth time that it was built properly. Last spring, Xia Huijuan brought back a plan for building a warm room from Beijing. She thought: The children's bedrooms should also have such equipment so they wouldn't get cold in the winter. Without iron pipes or tile pipes, they used brick pipes instead. The stove was built, and the brick pipes on both sides were also introduced into the bedroom, but when the fire was lit, it was filled with thick smoke. Finally, the brigade sent masons. These two workers initially did not understand the reason. They said: "Why are you always thinking of such bizarre ideas?" Xia Huijuan said: "There is nothing strange. The chimney of our stove is straight, now can't we change it to a horizontal one!" The masons were enlightened and found that the brick pipes had no outlet and the hot air could not flow, so it ran out of the stove opening. Finally, they rebuilt it. In winter, the children had hot water to use and could sleep warmly.
    One day, the brigade sent a dairy cow, saying it was for the nursery to milk. How wonderful it would be to increase nutrition for the children! However, it made the childcare workers very embarrassed. When milking, some pulled the cow's rope to prevent the cow from turning its head; some teased the cow with grass to distract it; some held the hooves to prevent it from kicking. After a long time, they only squeezed a few taels of milk. This won't do, they still need to learn. Xia Meigui, the childcare worker in charge of animal husbandry, learned the milking technique after studying at the commune livestock farm. She got up at four o'clock every morning to milk the cows so that the children could drink fresh milk.
    After several years of hard work, diligent study, and hard drilling, Jinjiang Nursery overcame many difficulties. Starting from two dilapidated houses and three yuan of start-up funds, it has now become more and more perfect. It has established a complete healthcare system, and has a children's dining hall that cooks food according to the needs of children. The nursery also has its own small farm, livestock farm, and fish pond. In this way, children can often eat fresh vegetables, beans, eggs, and meat. The nursery has very strict requirements for cleanliness and hygiene. It has a major cleaning every three days, the straw mats of the small hammocks are changed and washed every day, the bowls and chopsticks are disinfected every morning, and the children take a bath and change clothes every day. Older children have also developed the habit of washing their hands by the homemade tap before meals and after using the toilet, and not eating dirty things. All the children follow the schedule, eating, sleeping, and playing at regular times. Since the establishment of the nursery five years ago, the children who entered the nursery, even the weak ones, have become strong.
    The nursery has taken over the education and care of the children, reducing a lot of burden on the parents. The words of the Party Branch Secretary have been realized: the nursery has convinced the masses with facts and has won the high trust of the masses. Xia Xiaolin's father praised the nursery even more, saying: "Xiaolin's survival is all thanks to the nursery!" In the early days, there were only twelve children in the whole nursery, but now it has increased to more than eighty, and 90% of the children in the village have entered the nursery, and a kindergarten has also been opened.
    The masses have affirmed the achievements of the nursery, and given high honors to the nursery and Xia Huijuan, who led the six childcare workers and gave play to the spirit of hard struggle. The nursery has been rated as a model unit many times. Xia Huijuan, who became the director of the nursery at the age of seventeen, has been rated as a model more than ten times, has won the title of "Red and Expert Girl", and has honorably attended this National Conference of Heroes in Culture, Education, and Mass Organizations.

    为了培育新的一代
    ——锦江托儿所模范保育员夏惠娟
    本报记者　　陈婉雯
    “夏小林养得活，擂锤都会种出芽啦！”新会县双水人民公社富美大队锦江村一些人都曾这样说的。可是这话没有给说中，托儿所把夏小林养活了。现在长得又结实又灵巧，已经有三岁多了。
    夏小林出生后七个月便没有了母亲。他的父亲专门请了老婶娘料理他，这位老婶娘生怕饿着了小孩，老是向小孩的嘴里喂东西。不到一个月，夏小林的肠胃弄坏了，瘦得只剩下皮包骨，许多人看见了都不禁摇摇头，肯定说孩子养不活了。
    看到这个情况，锦江托儿所所长夏惠娟和保育员们难过极了，她们一再请求小林的父亲：“把孩子交给我们吧，我们会把他养好的。”小林父亲看到这些保育员都是些年轻姑娘，就想：连有经验的老婶娘还养不好，她们能行吗？但见小林瘦得这个样子，只好抱着试试看的心情送小林入所去。
    夏小林入托那天，一些群众便在那里议论纷纷，说这回托儿所是招祸上身了。夏惠娟的妈妈本来就不同意女儿当保育员，听到了这消息也赶到托儿所来，扯着女儿说：“弄坏了别人的孩子看你怎么办。”党支部书记听到群众的议论，也跑到所里看个究竟。他赞许保育员们为了培育新的一代的精神和勇气。并且问她们有什么困难，保育员说：“什么困难都不怕，就是怕群众议论多。”支部书记说：“那你们就用事实去说服群众，争取群众的更大信任吧！”
    夏小林因为长期拉肚子，失水过多，入所不几天，就发生抽疯性的休克。夏惠娟虽然受过保健工作的训练，有点急救知识。但毕竟没有经过实践，心情还是有点紊乱。但她想到要克服困难，镇定地按照急救程序施救。在医生赶到之前，使夏小林复苏过来。医生指出要养活夏小林就要小心护理，特别要注意他的饮食起居。托儿所经过仔细地研究后，便给小林定出了护理方案，那时所里的孩子都是日托，但夏小林却破例地被接收为全托，一切教养工作全由托儿所包下来。保育员们每天定时定量喂稀饭给他吃，给他治疗疮疥，无微不至地关心他的睡眠、增减衣服和注意清洁卫生。夏小林的生活有了规律，也就不再拉肚子了，慢慢地恢复了健康，并且越长越结实。
    夏小林的事例，给全体保育员很大的启发和很好的锻炼。她们认识到必须进一步改进托儿所的工作，才能够全面地教养好孩子，再不能停留在只会给孩子抹鼻涕、拉屎、把尿的工作上。保育工作必须从衣食住行等方面全面地关心孩子。但是该怎样开展这些工作好呢？那就学习吧。她们决定做一件学一件。托儿所分批地送保育员到公社、县保育员训练班去学习。当她们在学习别人的先进经验时，知道隔离室、幼儿厕所等是托儿所不可缺少的基本建设后，便利用晚上的休息时间去拆破屋，取旧料来修建。在一天夜里，她们趁着月色，全体出动去筑围墙，给孩子开辟一个日光浴的场所。围墙筑起来了，第二天一看，原来倾斜度很大，像要塌下来的样子。她们没有灰心，经过第二、三次的重建，不是一边高、一边低，就是弯弯曲曲的像一条龙，直到第四次才建得像个样子。去年春天，夏惠娟从北京带回来一个建暖室的规划。她想：孩子们的卧室也应该有这样的设备，冬天才不致受凉，没有铁管，没有瓦管，她们就用砖管来代替。火炉造好了，两旁的砖管也引进了卧室，可是烧起火来，浓烟密布。最后，大队派来了泥水工人，这两个工人最初也不明原由，他们说：“为什么你们尽是想些离奇古怪的主意？”夏惠娟说：“没有什么奇怪的，我们炉灶的烟囱是直竖的，现在改建成横的不就可以吗！”泥水工人得到了启发，发觉砖管没有出口，热空气不能流动，才从炉口跑出来。最后，他们终于改建好了。冬天，孩子们有热水用，而且能够暖暖和和地睡觉。
    有一天，大队送来了一条奶牛，说是给托儿所挤奶用的。能够给孩子们增加营养，该多么好！可是，又把保育员们弄得为难极了。挤奶时，有的拉牛绳，不准牛转头；有的逗牛吃草，分散它的注意力，有的按住蹄子，不让它踢。弄了半天，才挤了几两牛奶。这怎么行，还需要学习。负责畜牧的保育员夏玫瑰去公社畜牧场学习后，才掌握了挤奶的技术。她每天清早四时就起床挤牛奶了，让孩子们都喝到鲜牛奶。
    经过几年来的艰苦努力，勤学苦钻，锦江托儿所克服了重重的困难，从两间破屋、三块钱开办费做起，到现在已经办得一天比一天完善，已建立了一套完整的保健制度，并且有按照儿童需要烹调食物的儿童食堂。托儿所还有自己的小农场、畜牧场和鱼塘。这样，孩子们便能够经常吃到新鲜蔬菜、豆类、鸡蛋和肉类。托儿所对清洁卫生的要求很严格，三天大扫除一次，小吊床的草席天天换洗，碗筷朝朝消毒一遍，孩子每天都洗澡换衣服。大的孩子还养成饭前便后到土制自来水管边洗手，不吃脏东西的习惯。所有的小孩都按照生活日程表的安排，定时饮食、睡眠和游戏。建所五年以来，入所的孩子，瘦弱的也变成强壮了。
    托儿所把孩子的教养工作都包了下来，减轻了父母们不少负担。党支部书记的话给实现了：托儿所用事实说服了群众，获得了群众很高的信任。夏小林的父亲对托儿所更是赞不绝口的说：“小林养得活全是托儿所的功劳！”在初开办时，全所只有十二个小孩，现在已增加到八十多个，全村90％的孩子都入了所，还开设了幼儿园。
    群众肯定了托儿所的成绩，并给托儿所和带动六位保育员、发挥艰苦奋斗精神的夏惠娟以很高的荣誉。托儿所曾多次被评为模范单位。十七岁就当托儿所所长的夏惠娟曾十多次被评为模范，获得了“红专姑娘”的称号，并光荣地出席了这次全国文教群英会。
