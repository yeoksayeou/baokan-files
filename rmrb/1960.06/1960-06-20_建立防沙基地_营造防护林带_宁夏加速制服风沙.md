    Establishing Sand Control Bases and Creating Protective Forest Belts
    Ningxia Accelerates the Conquest of Wind and Sand
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Hui and Han people of Ningxia have achieved brilliant victories in their large-scale struggle against wind and sand disasters. At present, dozens of sand control forest bases, ranging from 500 mu to 10,000 mu, have been established along the wind and sand lines throughout the region. The bank protection forest belt along the Yellow River, especially the western bank of the Yellow River, from Rencun Ferry in Ningsuo County to Shizuishan City, a distance of over 300 li, has been basically connected. These forest belts have played a significant protective role, and some of the trees have grown into timber and are beginning to be harvested. In the Tengger Desert Zhongwei sand area, a magnificent green Great Wall has appeared on the shifting sand dunes from Huangcaohu to Shengjinguan, a length of about 97 li, bringing the "Yellow Dragon" (yellow sand) under control. At the same time, coupled with other agricultural measures, the grain output of farmland that was frequently subjected to wind and sand erosion in the past has gradually increased from just over 100 jin at the time of liberation to more than 300 jin. Land that had been buried by sand for many years has also been restored to cultivation.
    The realization of people's communes has brought about an unprecedented new situation in sand control work here. In the past two years, the region has afforested 260,000 mu along the wind and sand line, accounting for 70% of the total area afforested for sand control in the past ten years; 1.24 million mu have been closed off for sand stabilization and grass cultivation, accounting for 82% of the area closed off for cultivation in the past few years. In order to accelerate the process of greening the desert, 100,000 mu of grass were planted in open sand for the first time in 1959, and another 100,000 mu are planned to be planted during the rainy season this year.
    Ningxia's sand control work is guided by the principle of combining national centralized management with mass universal management, and combining professional team management with mass crash management, as well as the "three transformations" principle of forestry production. It actively uses the superior conditions of people's communes to establish forest farms on a large scale. At present, there are 14 commune-run and team-run forest farms and 6 state-run forest farms in the sand area. Due to the widespread establishment of forest farms, the progress of sand control has been accelerated.
    Now, the Hui and Han people in the sand area are full of confidence and propose to complete the 1,270-li-long main forest belt from Zhongwei to Yanchi, as well as the Yellow River bank protection forest and forest belts along canals, ditches, and roads, within the next three to five years, and strive to eliminate all the deserts that can be greened within eight years.

    建立防沙基地　营造防护林带
    宁夏加速制服风沙
    本报讯　宁夏回汉人民在向风沙灾害展开大规模斗争中，取得了辉煌胜利。目前，全区在风沙线上已经建立起五百亩至一万亩的防沙林基地几十处；沿黄河特别是黄河西岸由宁朔县仁存渡至石嘴山市约三百多华里长的护岸林带已经基本连接起来。这些林带已经起到显著的防护作用，有的已树木生长成材，开始采伐。腾格里沙漠中卫沙区由荒草湖至胜金关长约九十七华里的明沙丘上，已经出现了一条雄伟壮丽的绿色长城，把“黄龙”（黄沙）控制得服服贴贴。同时，再加上其它农业措施，使过去经常遭受风沙侵袭的农田的粮食产量，已由解放时的一百多斤逐渐增加到三百多斤。过去被沙压多年的土地也恢复了耕种。
    人民公社化的实现，使这里的治沙工作出现了空前未有的新局面。两年多来，全区沿风沙线造林二十六万亩，为十年来治沙造林总数的70％；封沙育草一百二十四万亩，为几年封育面积的82％。为了加快绿化沙漠的进程，1959年第一次在明沙拉种草十万亩，今年计划在雨季再种草十万亩。
    宁夏治沙工作是在国家集中治理和群众普遍治理相结合，专业队伍治理和群众突击治理相结合方针和林业生产“三化”方针指导下，积极运用人民公社优越条件大办林场。目前沙区已有社办、队办林场十四处，国营林场六处。由于普遍建立林场，加快了治沙进度。
    现在沙区回汉人民满怀信心地提出，要在今后三至五年内全部完成中卫至盐池这一条长达一千二百七十华里的基干林带和黄河护岸林以及渠、沟、道路等林带，争取八年内把可能绿化的沙漠全部消灭。
