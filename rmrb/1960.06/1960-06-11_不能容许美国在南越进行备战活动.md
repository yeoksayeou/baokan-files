The United States Must Not Be Allowed to Carry Out War Preparations in South Vietnam
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Today, this newspaper published news about the tenth interim report submitted by the Vietnam International Commission for Supervision and Control to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. This report generally mentions some instances of the South Vietnamese authorities violating the Geneva Accords. However, on some major issues related to maintaining peace in Vietnam and ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, the Indian and Canadian representatives, members of the Vietnam International Commission, have adopted an extremely unfair stance.

As everyone knows, due to the unbridled destruction of the Geneva Accords by American imperialism and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique, peace in Vietnam has always been in an unstable state. Under these circumstances, people had every reason to expect that the Vietnam International Commission, which is responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, would take effective measures to promptly stop the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in destroying the Geneva Accords, in order to benefit peace in Vietnam and Indochina. But unfortunately, this is not the case. On issues such as the illegal presence of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, the Indian and Canadian representatives of the Vietnam International Commission not only failed to uphold justice, but also, disregarding the repeated accusations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the resolute opposition of the Polish representative, passed resolutions by a majority vote supporting the serious crimes of the Geneva Accords violators.

The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" has become the "Taishang Huang" (Emperor Emeritus) sitting above the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam. It not only engages in training South Vietnamese troops and building military bases, but also directly commands South Vietnamese troops to carry out bloody "sweeps" and massacres against the South Vietnamese people, and directs them to carry out armed provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia. Today, the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam has actually become the most effective tool for the United States to pursue its war policy in the Indochina region. And American imperialism has recently attempted to greatly expand its "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam under the pretext of "rotating" former French military personnel. Obviously, this is another important step in the sinister conspiracy of American imperialism to deliberately create international tension and try its best to provoke war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Regarding the above situation, the Indian and Canadian representatives, as members of the International Commission, openly believe that the American military personnel are so-called "rotations" of the French military personnel who had already been withdrawn, and therefore "do not violate" Article 16 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam. Some people in India even openly stated: "Strengthening a military training delegation that was already established before the ceasefire by rotating one batch of military training personnel with another batch, in whole or in part, cannot be regarded as increasing military personnel, and therefore does not violate Article 16 of the agreement." This statement is, of course, completely untenable. Paragraph 4 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Article 16 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam both stipulate that foreign troops and military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam, and that all reinforcements and new military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam. The French troops stationed in South Vietnam were to be finally withdrawn according to the explicit provisions of the Geneva Accords, and have already been finally withdrawn. Therefore, there is no question of "rotating" French military personnel with American military personnel. To take a step back, even if the Geneva Accords stipulated that the French troops stationed in South Vietnam could carry out a one-to-one "rotation" before their withdrawal, that would only be within that specific period before the French troops withdrew, and it would also be limited to French military personnel to be "rotated". The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was originally signed by representatives of the French army and representatives of the Vietnam People's Army. The "rotation" stipulated in the agreement under specific circumstances, of course, only applies to the French military personnel in South Vietnam at that time and the Vietnam People's Army. Obviously, if the logic of the Indian side can be established, then the French colonial army in South Vietnam has withdrawn, and the American military personnel have the right to "rotate". Then, what is the difference between this and the neocolonialist argument of "filling the vacuum" advocated by the American ruling group? Did the Vietnamese people wage a long-term struggle against French colonialism, advancing wave upon wave, regardless of bloodshed and sacrifice, just to bring in American neo-colonialists after expelling the French colonial army? Was the Geneva Accords signed to replace the position of the old French colonialists with the colonial forces of the United States in South Vietnam?

The attitude of the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Commission on the issue of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's cruel persecution of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam is also very unfair. As everyone knows, Ngo Dinh Diem's Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 was formulated by the Ngo Dinh Diem group last year in order to cooperate with its military "sweeps" against the patriotic people of South Vietnam. According to this ordinance, the Ngo Dinh Diem group can persecute former resistance personnel and innocent civilians without any need for facts. Immediately following the promulgation of this ordinance, the South Vietnamese authorities also issued a document called "The Republic of Vietnam's Policy on Former Resistance Personnel," which fabricated history, reversed black and white, and portrayed all former resistance personnel as criminals of the Vietnamese nation, and clamored that they must be suppressed under "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959." For more than a year, the Ngo Dinh Diem group has used this fascist ordinance to carry out unprecedentedly barbarous persecution and massacres of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam. However, the Indian and Canadian representatives in the Vietnam International Commission have stubbornly insisted that this ordinance is "unrelated" to any provision of the Geneva Accords. Isn't this clearly standing on the side of the Ngo Dinh Diem group, defending and whitewashing its crimes of barbarously massacring former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam, destroying the Geneva Accords, and putting a "legal" cloak on the executioners of South Vietnam?

The Chinese people have always been concerned about maintaining peace in Indochina, and we resolutely oppose the American imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords and conduct new war preparations in South Vietnam. We cannot but regret that the Indian and Canadian representatives, especially India as the chairman of the Vietnam International Commission, have adopted such an unjust attitude, which is clearly extremely detrimental to peace in Vietnam and Indochina.

    不能容许美国在南越进行备战活动
    本报评论员
    今天本报发表了关于越南国际监察和监督委员会向日内瓦会议两位主席提出第十次临时报告的消息。这个报告一般地提到了南越当局违反日内瓦协议的某些事例。但是，在关系到维护越南和平和保证日内瓦协议在越南贯彻的一些重大问题上，越南国际委员会成员印度和加拿大代表却采取了极不公正的立场。
    大家知道，由于美帝国主义和南越吴庭艳集团对日内瓦协议的肆无忌惮的破坏，越南的和平始终处于不稳定的状态。在这种情况下，人们本来有一切理由期望作为监督和监察日内瓦协议在越南实施的越南国际委员会会采取有效措施，及时制止美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，以利越南和印度支那的和平。但是不幸，事实并非如此。在“美国军事援助顾问团”非法留驻南越等问题上，越南国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表不仅不主持公道，反而不顾越南民主共和国的一再指控和波兰代表的坚决反对，以多数票通过决议支持了日内瓦协议破坏者的严重罪行。
    “美国军事援助顾问团”已经成为高踞南越吴庭艳政权之上的“太上皇”，它不仅从事南越军队的训练和修建军事基地，而且还直接指挥南越军队对南越人民进行血腥的“扫荡”和屠杀，指使他们向越南民主共和国和柬埔寨王国进行武装挑衅。今天，在南越的“美国军事援助顾问团”实际上已成为美国在印度支那地区推行战争政策的最得力的工具。而美帝国主义在最近又企图以“轮换”前法国军事人员为借口，大量扩充它在南越的“军事援助顾问团”。显而易见，这是美帝国主义蓄意制造国际紧张局势，竭力想在印度支那和东南亚地区挑起战争的罪恶阴谋的又一个重要步骤。
    对于上述情况，作为国际委员会委员的印度和加拿大代表竟公然认为美国军事人员是所谓“轮换”早已撤走的法国军事人员，因而是“不违反”关于越南停止敌对行动协定第十六条的。印度方面还有人公开表示：“通过用一批军事训练人员全部或一部地轮换另一批人员的方法来加强停战前便已成立的一个军事训练代表团，这不能算作增加军事人员，因此并不违反协议第十六条”。这种说法当然是完全站不住脚的。日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四段和日内瓦协议关于越南停止敌对行动的协定第十六条都规定禁止外国军队和军事人员进入越南，禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南。法国驻南越的军队按日内瓦协议明文规定是要最后撤走的，而且已经最后撤走了，因此根本不存在用美国军事人员“轮换”法国军事人员的问题。退一步讲，即使日内瓦协议规定法国驻南越的军队在它撤走以前可以进行一对一的“轮换”，那也只是在法军撤走前那一段特定的时间以内，而且也只限于法国军事人员才能“轮换”。关于越南停止敌对行动的协定本来是法国军队的代表同越南人民军的代表所签订的，协定所规定的、在特定情况下的“轮换”，当然只适用于法国当时在南越的军事人员和越南人民军。很明显，如果印度方面的逻辑能够成立的话，南越的法国殖民军撤走了，美国的军事人员就有权“轮换”，那末，这同美国统治集团所鼓吹的“填补真空”的新殖民主义的论调又有什么两样呢？难道越南人民长期来进行反对法国殖民主义的斗争，前仆后继，不惜流血牺牲，就是为了在驱逐了法国殖民军之后，引来美国新殖民主义者吗？难道日内瓦协议是为了在南越由美国的殖民势力替代法国旧殖民者的地位而签订的吗？
    国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表在吴庭艳集团残酷地迫害南越前抗战人员和爱国人士问题上所持的态度也是十分不公正的。大家都知道，吴庭艳的1959年第十号法令是在去年吴庭艳集团为了配合它对南越爱国人民的军事“扫荡”而制订的。根据这项法令，吴庭艳集团可以完全不需要事实，对前抗战人员和无辜平民进行迫害。紧接着这个法令的颁布，南越当局又发表了所谓“越南共和国对前抗战人员的政策”的文件，竟伪造历史，颠倒黑白，把所有前抗战人员说成是越南民族的罪人，而叫嚷必须在“59年第十号法令”镇压之列。一年多以来，吴庭艳集团利用了这个法西斯法令，对南越前抗战人员和爱国人民进行了空前野蛮的迫害和屠杀。而越南国际委员会中的印度和加拿大的代表，居然硬说这项法令同日内瓦协议的任何条款“无关”。这不是明明白白地站在吴庭艳集团这一边，为它野蛮屠杀南越前抗战人员和爱国人民，破坏日内瓦协议的罪行进行辩护和洗刷，并替南越的刽子手披上一件“合法”的外衣吗？
    中国人民一向关怀印度支那和平的维护，我们坚决反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议并在南越进行新的战争准备的阴谋。我们不能不遗憾地认为，印度和加拿大代表，特别是作为越南国际委员会主席的印度采取这种不公正的态度，显然是极不利于越南和印度支那和平的。
