Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 2nd: Sichuan Province has achieved a bumper harvest of minor spring grain crops such as peas and broad beans this year. Judging from the threshing situation in various regions, the yield per unit area of peas and broad beans has greatly increased compared to last year, whether in mountainous or plain areas, old or new producing areas. In Xinhua Commune, Ningnan County, on the banks of the Jinsha River, the first trial planting of 64 mu of broad beans in winter paddy fields yielded an average of more than 500 jin per mu, completely breaking the superstition that winter paddy fields cannot be planted for two seasons. The harvest of spring potatoes is also very good in various places.

The bumper harvest of minor spring grain crops in Sichuan Province is a victory in implementing the policy of "planting more and harvesting more, and achieving high yields and more harvests" under the leadership of the Party. As early as last year when sowing spring crops, Party committees at all levels proposed that both staple grains and miscellaneous grains must be grasped. In addition to expanding the planting area in large fields, various places also fully mobilized the masses to widely use gaps in fields, around houses, and other vacant land to increase the planting of miscellaneous grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 2nd: The more than 44,000 mu of winter tobacco planted in the subtropical Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region last winter have generally turned yellow and matured, heralding a bumper harvest. At present, various places have entered the harvesting and curing period, and more than 2,200 curing barns in the region have been put into production. According to statistics, the three major tobacco producing areas of Beiliu, Pingnan, and Wuming alone have cured more than 920,000 jin of cured tobacco.

Under the guidance of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way," the tobacco planting area in the entire autonomous region has expanded a lot compared to last year. Judging from the harvested and cured winter tobacco, the yield per unit area has increased compared to last year. In order to harvest more tobacco leaves, all tobacco producing areas have retained two suckers on all tobacco plants. At the same time, breaking the tradition of not planting summer tobacco in Guangxi, large-scale planting of summer tobacco is underway.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 1st: The million-strong summer harvesting force in the Suzhou Special Zone, Jiangsu Province, joyfully started harvesting spring-ripening crops. From the shores of Taihu Lake to the south bank of the Yangtze River, a joyful atmosphere of spring harvest pervades the vast fields. Early-ripening barley, naked barley, and rapeseed have already been harvested. The harvest of later-ripening wheat, more than one million mu of which has recently been threshed, has also begun.

This year's spring-ripening crops in Suzhou, whether barley, naked barley, wheat, or rapeseed, are growing very well. Commune members said: "The wheat stalks are so thick they can be used to make drums, and the (rapeseed) stalks are like trees that can tie cattle." "Having farmed all my life, I have never seen such good wheat as this year." "Wheat can block the wind, rapeseed is like a pine tree, and broad beans are growing like a dragon on the edge of the fields." Xinhua Brigade, Huangjing Commune, Taicang County, which has achieved high yields every year since the Great Leap Forward, has harvested twenty-two mu of red-skinned barley with an average yield of 413 jin per mu, which is much higher than last year. The high-yield area established by the Kunshan County Party Committee in the historically drought-prone and flood-prone low-lying areas has also achieved an unprecedented large-scale harvest of more than 80,000 mu of barley, wheat, and naked barley this year.

Green manure, which accounts for 29 percent of the region's cultivated land, has also achieved a bumper harvest. Now, various places are turning the harvested green manure into fertilizer ponds in large quantities to prepare grass mud fertilizer for striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 2nd: Wheat and rapeseed along the Bailong River and Rhino River in Wudu County, Gansu Province, have been fully harvested. The wheat in Wudu County is growing well this year, especially the wheat in the carefully cultivated high-yield areas and high-yield fields, which has many plants, high stalks, and large ears, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest.

In order to achieve high yields and good harvests, all people's communes have classified and ranked wheat fields according to their maturity periods and formulated harvesting plans. The county has established a summer harvest and summer planting headquarters, and five county party secretaries and more than 140 cadres have gone deep into various people's communes and production teams to specifically guide the summer harvest and summer planting work. All communes have also comprehensively arranged various farm work, organized specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and gleaning, so as to achieve immediate harvesting upon ripening, careful harvesting and threshing, and ensuring that every blade of grass is returned to the field and every grain is stored in the granary.

    丰收捷报
    四川杂粮大丰收
    据新华社成都二日电　四川省今年种植的豌豆、胡豆等小春杂粮作物获得了大丰收。从各地已经收割脱粒的情况来看，无论山区或平坝，老产区或新产区，豌豆和胡豆单位产量都比去年大大增加。金沙江畔宁南县的新华公社，今年第一次利用冬水田试种的六十四亩水厢胡豆，获得平均亩产五百多斤的高产，彻底打破了认为冬水田不能种两季的迷信。各地春洋芋的收成也很好。
    四川省小春杂粮作物大丰收，是在党的领导下贯彻多种多收和高产多收方针的胜利。早在去年播种小春作物的时候，各级党委就提出必须既抓主粮，又抓杂粮。各地除扩大大田种植面积外，还充分发动群众，广泛利用田边地角、屋前屋后等空隙土地增种杂粮。
    广西冬烟产量高
    据新华社南宁二日电　亚热带的广西僮族自治区去冬种植的四万四千多亩冬烟，已普遍黄熟，喜报丰收。目前各地已进入收烤时期，全区已有二千二百多间烤房投入生产。据统计，仅北流、平南、武鸣三个主要产烟区就已烤出九十二万多斤烤烟。
    在“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针指导下，全自治区烤烟种植面积比去年扩大很多。从收烤的冬烟来看，单位面积产量比去年提高。为了多收烟叶，各产烟区都把所有的烟叶留了二杈烟；同时，打破广西历来不种夏烟的习惯，大种夏烟。
    苏州地区夏季满堂红
    据新华社南京一日电　江苏省苏州专区的百万夏收队伍，满怀喜悦开镰抢收春熟作物。从太湖之滨到长江南岸，千里沃野上到处洋溢着春熟丰收的欢乐气氛。全区收割较早的元麦、大麦、油菜，早已登场，收割较迟的小麦，最近也有一百多万亩登场脱粒。
    今年苏州春熟作物，无论大麦、元麦、小麦、油菜都长得很好。社员们说：“麦秆粗大能打鼓，（油）菜秆象树能拴牛”，“种田种得头发白，从未见过今年的好小麦”，“麦子能挡风，油菜像棵松，‘十边’蚕豆一条龙”。大跃进以来年年高产的太仓县璜泾公社新华大队，今年已经收割的二十二亩红皮大麦，平均单产四百一十三斤，比去年增产很多。昆山县委在历来易旱易涝的低洼地区办的丰产片，今年八万多亩大麦、小麦、元麦也获得空前的大面积丰收。
    占全区耕地面积百分之二十九的绿肥，也获得了大丰收。现在各地都在把收割的绿肥大量翻入肥潭，沤制草塘泥，为争取秋田丰收准备肥料。
    甘肃武都开镰收割
    据新华社兰州二日电　甘肃省武都县沿白龙江和犀牛江两岸的小麦和油菜，已经全面开镰收割。武都县今年的麦子生长良好，特别是精心培育的丰产方和丰产田的麦子，更是株多秆高穗大，呈现一片大丰收的景象。
    为了做到丰产丰收，各人民公社都根据麦田成熟期的先后，分类排队，订出收割计划。县已成立了夏收夏种指挥部，五个县委书记和一百四十多名干部已分别深入到各人民公社和生产队，具体指导夏收夏种工作。各公社也都全面安排了各种农活，组织了收割、运输、打碾、拾麦等专业队，以便做到随黄随割，细收细打，寸草归场，颗粒归仓。
