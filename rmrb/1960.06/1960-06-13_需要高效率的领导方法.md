High-Efficiency Leadership Methods Needed

Kong Sang

For a leading organization or a leading cadre, it is necessary to always be at the forefront of the masses. The faster the movement progresses, the faster production increases, the higher the efficiency of leadership must be; otherwise, it will fall behind the situation and be unable to play the role of leading the masses to promote production.

In the battle to achieve a substantial increase in production in June, the facts of countless enterprises have once again proved this point: wherever the leading cadres have displayed a fighting leadership style and adopted high-efficiency leadership methods, production has rapidly and substantially increased. Conversely, wherever production is slow to increase, an examination of the work there will always reveal, to a greater or lesser extent, that the pace of leadership is somewhat out of step with the objective situation. In some enterprises, how to immediately adopt high-efficiency leadership methods has become the key to whether or not the current production can be promoted to a substantial increase.

What are high-efficiency leadership methods? The experiences of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant and the Fuxin Ping'an No. 1 Mine tell us that going directly to the scene and directly to the masses of workers is the most efficient and effective leadership method. The "secret" to promoting an immediate rise in production lies here.

Many factories are now using the spirit of rectification to examine and correct the sentiments of complacency or fear of difficulty among cadres. This is the primary step in promoting increased production, and it is being grasped correctly. However, what method should be used to improve? Gathering in the conference room for meetings is one method, and it is the method usually used. This method is not bad, but it cannot be said to be highly efficient. Because while you are meeting in the room, the problems in production are still there, waiting. Nearly half a month of June has passed, and delays and waiting will cause a loss of opportunity. The Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant's approach is: go to the scene, the Party committee holds meetings in the workshop where production is weakest, inviting the masses of workers to directly raise their opinions, and the relevant cadres at all levels directly solve the problems on the spot, which is both "rectified" deeply and "corrected" quickly. This is a high-efficiency leadership method, a leadership method with a fighting spirit.

Production meetings are held by every enterprise every day. Workshop directors and section chiefs bring up the problems from below, report and discuss them one by one, the factory director makes decisions, and then they go back to convey and deploy the work to the workers. This is one way of holding meetings, and it is the usual way. Another way, like Ping'an No. 1 Mine, is to go directly to the pithead and hold meetings with the workers, with the workers directly stating the problems in production, and the assigned work being directly explained to the workers. Obviously, the latter method is the high-efficiency, fighting-spirited method.

Is it only for the sake of winning a substantial overproduction in June that we should adopt this leadership method? No, this is not a temporary measure. Our production will increase substantially every month and every year. To lead production in the most direct way possible, in the way that is closest to the workers and closest to production, this is the requirement of the entire Great Leap Forward era for all leading cadres. Millions of workers and staff are bravely advancing, seizing a substantial increase in production in June. May everyone take advantage of this excellent situation to greatly improve our leadership methods and turn June into a month of harvest: a harvest of production, a harvest of thought, and a harvest of leadership skills.

    需要高效率的领导方法
    孔桑
    对于一个领导机关、一个领导干部来说，要时时刻刻走在群众的前面。运动进展得越快，生产增长得越快，领导的效率要更高；否则就会落在形势的后面，无从发挥带领群众推动生产的作用。
    在实现6月份大幅度增产的战斗中，无数企业的事实再次证明了这一点：哪里的领导干部发挥了战斗的领导作风，采取了高效率的领导方法，哪里的生产就迅速地大幅度地上升。反之，哪里的生产上去得慢，检查一下那里的工作，总会多多少少发现领导的步子有些跟不上客观形势。在有些企业里，如何马上采取高效率的领导方法，已成为能否促进当前生产大幅度增长的关键。
    什么是高效率的领导方法？浦镇车辆厂和阜新平安一坑的经验告诉我们：直接到现场去，直接到工人群众中去，这就是效率最高、效果最好的领导方法。促进生产马上上升的“秘诀”就在这里。
    现在有不少工厂用整风的精神检查、纠正干部中的自满或畏难的情绪。这是促进生产上升的首要一着，抓得很对。但是，用什么方法来改进呢？集合在会议室里开会，这是一种方法，是通常使用的方法。这种方法并不坏，但是不能说它的效率高。因为你在屋里开会的时候，生产中的问题仍然在那里摆着、等着。6月份已经过去将近半个月了，一拖一等，就要失去时机。浦镇车辆厂的做法是：到现场去，党委会就在生产最薄弱的车间里开会，请工人群众直接提意见，各级有关的干部就在当时当地直接解决问题，既“整”得深，又“改”得快。这是高效率的领导方法，有战斗气息的领导方法。
    生产会议，这是每个企业每天都要召开的。车间主任、科长们把下面的问题带上来，一个个汇报、讨论，厂长作出决定，然后再回去向工人传达、布置。这是一种开法，也是通常的开法。另一种开法，像平安一坑那样，直接到坑口去，和工人一起开，生产中的问题直接由工人说，布置的工作直接向工人讲。显然，后一种方法才是高效率的、有战斗气息的方法。
    是不是为了夺取6月份的大幅度超产，才要采取这种领导方法呢？不，这不是临时性的措施。我们的生产每一月、每一年都要大幅度增长的。尽可能采取最直接的方式，最接近工人、最接近生产的方式来领导生产，这是整个跃进年代对所有领导干部的要求。千百万职工群众正勇猛向前，夺取6月份的大幅度增产，愿大家乘这大好形势，把我们的领导方法大大提高一步，把6月份变成丰收月：生产丰收，思想丰收，领导的本领也来个丰收。
