Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - Hundreds of thousands of people in North Vietnam held anti-American demonstrations. The Central Committee of the Fatherland Front called on all people to vigorously promote the struggle against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission to stop South Vietnam from expanding military airports.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - Over 50,000 residents, workers, cadres, students, women, and others in Hanoi held rallies and demonstrations this afternoon and evening, strongly opposing the US imperialist policy of arms expansion, war preparations, and aggression, and severely condemning the crimes of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam. This shows that the prelude to the massive anti-US-Ngo Dinh Diem struggle movement of the people of North Vietnam has been unveiled.

    After 5 p.m., workers, cadres, students, and others, carrying banners, slogans, and satirical cartoons, flocked to the rally venues. Huge banners read: "Down with US imperialism" and "US imperialism get out of South Vietnam." The entire city was filled with crowds participating in the rallies.

    In the Ba Dinh district, 15,000 workers, members of handicraft cooperatives, and street residents held an anti-US-Ngo rally. A district people's representative angrily exposed the towering crimes of US imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Representatives of the district Fatherland Front and workers, in their speeches, expressed their firm opposition to the US-Ngo clique's conspiracy of arms expansion and war preparations, and supported the arguments put forward by Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his letter of June 24th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. In his letter, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong requested the International Commission to reconsider and revoke its decisions regarding allowing an increase in US military personnel in South Vietnam and regarding the Law No. 10 of 1959 as not violating the Geneva Accords. He also demanded that the US Military Assistance Advisory Group be expelled from South Vietnam and that the Geneva Accords be strictly implemented to stop the persecution, discrimination, and massacre of former resistance personnel.

    At an anti-US-Ngo rally held at the Labor Club Square by 2,500 cadres of trade unions at all levels in Hanoi, a resolution was unanimously passed, fiercely condemning the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's crimes of undermining the Geneva Accords for six years, and opposing the International Commission's decision to allow the US Military Assistance Advisory Group to increase military personnel and to consider the Law No. 10 of 1959 as unrelated to the Geneva Accords. Duan Chenjing, a representative of the Hanoi Trade Union, said at the meeting that the working people of Hanoi support the anti-American struggles of the people of Korea, the people of Japan, and the people of other countries. He expressed his firm support for the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and opposed the US imperialist plot to create "two Chinas."

    The Hoan Kiem district, Dong Xuan district, Zhengwang district, and many factories and schools in Hanoi held anti-US-Ngo rallies this afternoon and evening. After the meetings, the participants held demonstrations. The demonstrators were full of indignation, and anti-American slogans rose one after another, echoing through the sky.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - According to reports in local newspapers, in the past month, various provinces and cities in North Vietnam have held rallies and demonstrations against US imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, angrily shouting "US imperialism get out of South Vietnam!" and demanding that the Vietnam International Commission revise its inappropriate conclusions regarding the increase in military personnel of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" and the "Law No. 10 of 1959" of South Vietnam.

    According to incomplete statistics, since the end of May, 220,000 people in Hanoi have held 682 rallies to oppose the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" staying in South Vietnam and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's promulgation of the 1959 fascist Law No. 10.

    From January to now, 170 delegations of the people of Hanoi have gone to the Hanoi office of the International Commission, demanding that the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" get out of South Vietnam and that the "Law No. 10 of 1959" be revoked.

    Many other places have also held rallies and demonstrations against the US-Ngo clique. In Haiphong City, more than 150,000 people participated in the first ten days of June alone; more than 120,000 people in Hai Duong Province; and more than 100,000 people in Ha Nam Province.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a letter to the entire nation on the 28th, calling on the Vietnamese people to strengthen the anti-American struggle from now until July 20th (the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords in 1954), to urge US imperialism to get out of South Vietnam and all of Asia.

    The letter to the entire nation stated: "In South Vietnam, the people's struggle movement is rising unprecedentedly, and the US-Ngo clique is becoming increasingly isolated. At present, they are strengthening their armaments, intensifying the suppression and persecution of the people, obscuring public opinion, and slandering North Vietnam, paving the way for US imperialism and the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to intervene more deeply in South Vietnam."

    The letter to the entire nation stated: "Faced with the above situation, in order to commemorate July 20th (the day the Geneva Accords were signed in 1954), the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front calls on all people, cadres, and soldiers to vigorously promote the struggle against the US-Ngo clique, to accuse US imperialism of its aggression and war conspiracies, as well as the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's crimes in South Vietnam, to support the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, to promote the patriotic spirit against the US-Ngo clique, to actively build the socialist North, and to support the anti-American struggles of the people of Korea, Japan, and the world."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th - According to the Vietnam News Agency, the South Vietnamese authorities recently expanded the Binh Dao airport located in Quang Ngai province along the coast, attempting to make this airport a base for the illegal activities of the US Air Force in South Vietnam.

    The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army raised this incident, which violated the Geneva Accords, with the International Commission on June 18th and requested the International Commission to send a mobile team to Binh Dao to conduct long-term supervision in order to stop this activity that violates the military provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th - The Vietnam "People's Daily" published a commentary today, saying that the International Commission's announcement that it would no longer consider the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's persecution of former resistance personnel in the Huang Liko incident showed that the International Commission had made concessions to serious violations of the Geneva Accords.

    The commentary said that the murder of former resistance personnel Nguyen Van Liet, the savage retaliation against Tran Thi Ly, the poisoning of more than 6,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp, the half-dead life of 3,000 patriots in the Con Dao prison, and thousands of other retaliation incidents are all requiring the International Commission to take an selfless attitude and fulfill its responsibility to strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

    The commentary said, "The Vietnamese people are waging a fierce struggle, demanding that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique must stop persecution and retaliation, and must strictly implement the Geneva Accords. Tens of thousands of suggestions sent to the International Commission by millions of people have shown the above resolute will."

    下午五时以后，下了班的工人、干部、学生等，高举横幅标语、讽刺漫画，纷纷走向集会场所，巨幅标语上写着：“打倒美帝国主义”“美帝国主义滚出南越”。整个市区到处是参加集会的人群。
    在巴亭区一万五千名工人、手工业合作社社员和街道居民举行了反美吴集会。区人民代表在会上愤怒地揭露了美帝国主义和它的走狗吴庭艳集团的滔天罪行，区祖国战线代表和工人代表在发言中都表示坚决反对美吴集团的扩军备战阴谋，支持范文同外交部长6月24日给日内瓦会议两主席的信中提出的论点。范文同总理在信中要求国际委员会重新考虑和撤销它关于允许增加在南越的美国军事人员和关于1959年第十号法令不违背日内瓦协议的决议，要求把美国军事援助顾问团逐出南越和严正履行日内瓦协议，停止迫害、歧视和残杀前抗战人员。
    河内市各级工会干部二千五百人在劳动俱乐部广场上举行的反美吴集会上，一致通过决议，激烈谴责美国—吴庭艳集团六年来破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，反对国际委员会作出的允许美国军事援助顾问团增加军事人员和认为1959年第十号法令与日内瓦协议无关的决议。河内市工会代表段陈景在会上说，河内市劳动人民支持朝鲜人民、日本人民和其他各国人民的反美斗争。他表示坚决支持中国人民解放台湾，反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    河内的还剑区、同春区、政王区以及许多工厂、学校今天下午和晚上都举行了反美吴集会。参加集会的人们在会议结束以后举行了示威游行，示威者群情激愤，反美口号此起彼伏响彻云霄。
    新华社河内29日电　据这里的报纸报道：越南北方各省、市最近一个月来纷纷举行反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的集会和示威，愤怒地高呼“美帝国主义滚出南越！”，并且要求越南国际委员会修改它对“美国军事援助顾问团”增加军事人员和对南越“1959年第十号法令”所作出的不适当的结论。
    根据不完全的统计，从5月底到现在，河内市已有二十二万人举行过六百八十二次集会，反对“美国军事援助顾问团”赖在南越和反对吴庭艳集团颁布的1959年第十号法西斯法令。
    从1月到现在，河内人民已经有一百七十个代表团到国际委员会河内办事处，要求“美国军事援助顾问团”滚出南越和撤销“1959年第十号法令”。
    其他许多地方也都举行了反对美吴集团的集会和示威。在海防市，仅在6月头十多天中就有十五万多人参加；海阳省已有十二万多人；河南省也有十万多人。
    据新华社河内29日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会在28日发表告全民书，号召越南人民从现在起到7月20日（1954年日内瓦协议签订六周年）这一期间，加强反美斗争，促使美帝国主义从南越和亚洲各地滚出去。
    告全民书说：“在越南南方，人民的斗争运动空前高涨，美吴集团越来越陷于孤立。目前它们正在加强军备，加强镇压和迫害人民，蒙蔽舆论，诬蔑越南北方，为美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团更深入地干涉南越铺平道路。”
    告全民书说：“面对上述情况，为了纪念7月20日（1954年日内瓦协议签订的日子），越南祖国战线中央委员会号召全体人民、干部和战士，大力推动反对美吴集团的斗争，控告美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋以及吴庭艳集团在南越的罪行，支持南越人民的斗争，发扬反对美吴集团的爱国精神，积极建设社会主义的北方，支持朝鲜、日本和世界人民的反美斗争。”
    据新华社河内28日电　据越南通讯社报道，南越当局最近把位于沿海广义省的平岛的飞机场加以扩建，企图使这个机场成为美国在南越的空军部队进行非法活动的基地。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在6月18日向国际委员会提出了这个违反日内瓦协议的事件，并要求国际委员会派一个流动小组到平岛去进行长期监督，以便制止这种违反日内瓦协议军事条款的活动。
    据新华社河内27日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，国际委员会宣布不再考虑吴庭艳集团迫害前抗战人员黄励柯事件的行为表明，国际委员会对严重违反日内瓦协议的罪行作了让步。
    评论说，前抗战人员阮文烈被杀害、陈氏李遭到野蛮报复、富利集中营六千多名爱国者被毒害、昆仑岛监狱三千爱国者过着半活不死的生活以及其他成千起报复事件都正在要求国际委员会采取无私的态度，并对严格履行日内瓦协议尽到它的责任。
    评论说，“越南人民正在进行激烈的斗争，要求吴庭艳集团必须停止迫害和报复行为，必须严格履行日内瓦协议。成百万人寄给国际委员会的成万项建议书，都显示了上述坚决意志。”
