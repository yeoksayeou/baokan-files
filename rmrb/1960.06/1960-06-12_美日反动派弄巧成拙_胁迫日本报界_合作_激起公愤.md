    美日反动派弄巧成拙
    胁迫日本报界“合作”激起公愤
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本记者会议在10日晚间通过一项决议，尖锐抨击岸信介政府和美国大使馆干涉日本报纸的社论政策的行为。
    这项由一百人参加的日本记者会议特别会议通过的决议，要求日本报纸的编辑和发行人不要向岸信介政府和美国大使馆施加的压力屈服。
    岸信介和美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二曾经在7日分别会见了东京各大报纸的代表和编辑，要求各报在艾森豪威尔访问日本问题上同他们“合作”。
    会议还通过一项决议反对艾森豪威尔访问日本和批准新的日美“安全条约”。
    会议结束以后，与会者拿着灯笼和标语牌在美国大使馆前面举行了示威。
