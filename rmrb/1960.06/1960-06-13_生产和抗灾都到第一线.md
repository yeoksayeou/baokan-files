    Shantou Special District Cadres at All Levels Determined to Be Pragmatic and Genuine Promoters
    Production and Disaster Relief Both to the Front Lines
    The District Party Committee stipulates that the District Party Committee Secretary and members should spend five months each year, and the County Party Committee Secretary and members should spend seven months each year, living in communes and factories and mines, and first going deep into backward areas and backward units to achieve concrete leadership
    Guangzhou, June 12th (This newspaper) – Leading cadres at all levels in the Shantou Special District of Guangdong Province are further improving their work style, leaving their offices and going deep into the forefront of production. They are going deep into the scene, deep into the grassroots, and deep into backward units, earnestly leading the masses to achieve continued great leaps forward. The eight secretaries of the Shantou District Party Committee have moved to communes and factories in Jieyang, Meixian, Dabu, Haifeng and other places to settle down. Responsible cadres of the District Party Committee's agriculture, industry, trade, and the Youth League and Women's Federation departments have also gone to the countryside to delve into key areas. Under the impetus of the District Party Committee, 97.6% of the County Party Committee secretaries in the district's thirteen counties (excluding Nanao and Dabu), 81.1% of the County Party Committee members, and 84.4% of the Commune Party Committee secretaries have gone deep into the front lines of production.
    In mid-May, the Shantou District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China made a "Decision on Further Improving the Work Style of Cadres," stipulating that the District Party Committee Secretary and District Party Committee members should spend five months each year, and the County Party Committee Secretary and County Party Committee members should spend seven months each year living in communes and factories, achieving concrete leadership. This decision was praised and supported by Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Cadres at all levels immediately and unreservedly resolutely implemented this decision of the District Party Committee and formulated systems for improving cadre work style and leadership methods. Many Commune Party Committees have also decided to move their commune offices to production teams.
    According to the decision of the Shantou District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, leading cadres at all levels first go deep into backward communes, backward brigades, backward factories and mines, and backward workshops to help cadres and masses in backward areas and backward units thoroughly change their backward status and promote comprehensive and balanced development of all work. At the same time, all cadres going to the countryside eat, live, and labor with the masses without exception. Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou District Party Committee, Huang Qingbo, Secretary, and Sun Ming, Deputy Minister of the Rural Department, personally went deep into a backward area including four brigades in the Paotai Commune of Jieyang County and worked with local cadres and masses to manage high-yield fields on 12,000 mu of backward land. As soon as Comrade Luo Tian and others arrived at the production team, they settled down here like during the land reform, worked with the commune members, and ate together in the cafeteria. The masses were greatly encouraged and enthusiastic, and went to the fields with Comrade Luo Tian and others in the rain. Leading cadres in Wuhua County went deep into backward areas, and 87 backward brigades in the county were contracted by 61 county cadres, 48 commune party committee secretaries, and 74 commune party committee members. The 17 backward brigades and 57 backward teams in the suburbs of Shantou City have also been contracted by leading cadres at all levels to change their backward status within a time limit. Every cadre going to the countryside in the entire suburbs carries labor tools and labor manuals and is determined to be a good "seven-member": production commander, production combatant, technician, cook, feeder, propagandist, and learning instructor. Qiu Keming, First Secretary of the Chenghai County Party Committee, went deep into the backward Henglong Brigade of Shanghua Commune, immediately conducted an in-depth inspection of the cafeteria work, and helped cafeteria cadres plan vegetable production.
    The arduous and in-depth work style of leading cadres at all levels has greatly moved the masses. After Li Enzhong, First Secretary of the Xingning County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the backward Shenguang Brigade of Diaofang Commune, the commune members said: The County Party Secretary shares weal and woe with us, and we must work harder. When the commune members of the Ziran Brigade of Lantang Commune in Zijin County saw that the leading cadres had further improved their work style, they sang: When the secretary comes down, things are different, leading cadres to change their style; production and life are taken care of together, and production is booming.
    At dawn on the 9th of this month, when the Shantou Special District was hit by a typhoon and torrential rain, leading cadres at all levels took the lead in fighting the flood. Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou District Party Committee, commanded the battle around the clock on the front line of flood fighting. Wherever danger appeared, leading cadres appeared there, and many dangers were turned into safety after the timely command and rescue of leading cadres. Cai Mingsong, Secretary of the Fuping Commune Party Committee in Chao'an County, dived into the rapids more than 20 times in a row, directing commune members to drive piles and throw stones. When part of the embankment showed signs of collapse, he decisively led dozens of young and middle-aged commune members to jump into the water to protect the embankment, turning the dangerous section of the embankment into safety.

    汕头专区各级干部决心做脚踏实地的真正的促进派
    生产和抗灾都到第一线
    地委规定：地委书记和委员每年应有五个月时间，县委书记和委员每年应有七个月时间，住在公社和厂矿，并且首先深入后进地区和后进单位，实现具体领导
    本报广州12日电　广东省汕头专区各级领导干部进一步改进工作作风，纷纷走出办公室，深入生产第一线。他们深入到现场、深入到基层、深入到后进单位，切切实实地带领群众实现继续跃进。中共汕头地委的八个书记已分别搬到揭阳、梅县、大埔、海丰等地的公社、厂矿安家落户。地委的农业、工业、财贸和青年团、妇联等部门的负责干部，也已纷纷下乡，深入重点。在地委的带动下，全区十三个县（缺南澳、大埔）97．6％的县委书记，81．1％的县委委员，84．4％的公社党委书记，都已深入到生产第一线去。
    中共汕头地委在5月中旬作出了“关于进一步改进干部工作作风的决定”，规定地委书记、地委委员每年应有五个月的时间，县委书记、县委委员每年应有七个月的时间住在公社、厂矿，实现具体领导。这一决定得到了中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志的赞许和支持。各级干部立即毫无例外的坚决贯彻执行地委这一决定，并且制订了改进干部作风和领导方法的制度。许多公社党委还决定把公社办公室搬到生产队去。
    根据中共汕头地委的决定，各级领导干部首先是深入到后进公社、后进大队、后进厂矿、后进车间，帮助后进地区和后进单位的干部和群众，彻底改变落后面貌，促使各项工作全面、平衡的发展。同时，所有下乡的干部都毫无例外的和群众同食、同住、同劳动。中共汕头地委第一书记罗天、书记黄清波、农村部副部长孙明，亲自深入到揭阳县炮台公社一个包括四个大队的后进片，和当地的干部、群众一起，在一万二千亩落后田中经营高产片。罗天同志等一到生产队，就像土地改革时一样，在这里安家落户，和社员一起劳动，一起在食堂吃饭。群众受到很大的鼓舞，劲头很大，与罗天同志等一起冒雨下田。五华县的领导干部深入到后进地区，全县八十七个后进大队，由六十一个县的干部、四十八个公社党委书记、七十四个公社党委委员包干负责。汕头市郊的十七个后进大队、五十七个后进小队，也已由各级领导干部包干负责，限期改变落后面貌。全郊区的每个下乡干部都携带劳动工具、劳动手册，并且决心努力当好“七员”：生产指挥员，生产战斗员，技术员，炊事员，饲养员，宣传员，学习辅导员。澄海县委第一书记丘克明深入到上华公社后进的横陇大队后，立即深入检查食堂工作，帮助食堂干部规划蔬菜生产。
    各级领导干部这种艰苦深入的工作作风，使群众非常感动。中共兴宁县委第一书记栗恩仲深入到刁坊公社后进的神光大队后，社员们都说：县委书记和我们同甘共苦，我们更要加油干。紫金县蓝塘公社自然大队的社员看到领导干部进一步改进了工作作风，便歌唱道：书记下来就不同，带领干部改作风；生产生活齐抓好，生产搞得火样红。
    本月9日凌晨，汕头专区遭受台风和特大暴雨袭击时，各级领导干部都身先士卒和洪水搏斗。汕头地委第一书记罗天夜以继日地在抗洪最前线指挥战斗。哪个地方出现险象，领导干部就在哪里出现，许多险象在领导干部的及时指挥与抢救后转危为安。潮安县浮萍公社党委书记蔡名松在急流中一连潜水二十多次，指挥社员打桩投石。当部分堤岸出现下塌现象时，他又当机立断，带领几十个青壮年社员跳下水去，保堤护堤，使堤段转危为安。
