Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 22nd: Shanghai's literary and art workers are actively performing plays, composing songs, writing poetry, and creating artwork, brandishing various literary weapons to vocally and in writing severely denounce the American imperialists' crimes of aggression.

June 21st was the first day of Shanghai's "Week of Propaganda Against American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace." All of the city's hundreds of theaters and performance venues are staging or adding performances of dramas, traditional operas, and short, sharp spoken word pieces, skits, and satirical plays on the theme of opposing American imperialist aggression. Yesterday, fifty-nine cinemas, cultural palaces, and clubs screened films opposing American imperialist aggression and resisting America and aiding Korea throughout the day. The Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station's broadcasting week began yesterday with the aim of issuing a furious roar against the arch warmonger Eisenhower through opera, poetry, literary recitations, speeches, and other forms. The television station broadcast the skit "A Scandal in the White House" and the Yue Opera "Angrily Beating the God of Plague," and also screened a recently received film from Tokyo: the ugly farce of the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly and illegally "passing" the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and the real situation of a large demonstration of 200,000 people in Tokyo when the Japanese people launched their sixteenth unified action. Yesterday, many amateur literary and art workers in factories also performed various programs opposing American imperialist aggression after work and during rest periods.

In the evening, the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe performed the Shanghai Opera "Kim Dal-rae" at the opening ceremony of the city's "Week of Propaganda Against American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace" artistic performances. The entire audience was deeply moved, and everyone couldn't help shouting "Down with American Imperialism!" This play depicts a female hero of the Korean people who, in order to rescue the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier Yue Shouying who had once saved her from the butcher's knife of the American invading army, used a grenade to kill many American devils and rescued Yue Shouying. The Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe performed it several times in 1953 and 1955 and was warmly welcomed by the audience. This troupe has also self-compiled, self-directed, and self-performed a new play, "Hiroshima Girl," in the past two days, which they plan to stage.

The Shanghai People's Art Theater, whether it be playwrights, directors, actors, or stage lighting and set designers, has all taken action. Early yesterday morning, all the members of the theater's dialect drama troupe and slapstick comedy troupe rushed to the theater to rehearse with high spirits the multi-act play "Kinmen's Raging Fire," the short play "Such is America," "Heart-Pounding," the foreign film "Nowhere to Run," and other seven programs they have created. Veteran artists Wu Saiwen, Wang Meiyu, Qian Aili, and others, despite having performance tasks, still used after-dinner or rest time to collectively create two plays, "Ike, Where Are You Running To?" and "The Plague God's Travelogue." In 1954, the people of Shanghai expressed great indignation when watching the drama "The Luxemburgs," which exposed American imperialism's strangulation of democratic freedom; when the peace warriors the Luxemburgs sacrificed their lives six years ago, and the executioner Eisenhower was provoking and getting beaten everywhere in the Far East, yesterday, the people of Shanghai saw the Shanghai People's Art Theater perform this heroic play again, cursing the doomed American robbers with even stronger hatred. The audience in the audience paid tribute to the great warriors the Luxemburgs with warm applause. Actors Zhang Fei and Xiong Xuecen, who played the Luxemburgs, rehearsed this play in a little over a day. In the Children's Art Theater, the China Welfare Association Children's Art Theater performed a large chorus of "Drive American Imperialism Back to Its Old Home" and five short plays such as "Angry Taiwan" and "Drive the American Imperialists Out of South Vietnam," which moved the hearts of the children. The Jinjiang Panjing Puppet Troupe from Fujian Province is performing in Shanghai, and they added a puppet skit, "Everyone Beats the Rat Crossing the Street," in front of the curtain, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Among the performances in the various theaters, there were many famous actors who had been to the Korean front and the Fujian front to give慰问 performances, and they all performed their best plays opposing American imperialist aggression. Acrobat Sun Tai performed the two programs "Bombarding Kinmen Island" and "Shooting Down Airplanes." Pingtan actress Zhu Huizhen sang the short Pingtan story "China-Korea Friendship."

    据新华社上海22日电　上海文艺工作者纷纷演戏、编歌、写诗、作画，挥动各种文艺武器，口诛笔伐，严厉声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。
    21日是上海市人民举行“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的第一天。全市上百家戏院、剧场全部上演或加演以反对美帝国主义斗争为题材的戏剧、曲艺和短小精悍的说唱、活报、讽刺剧等。五十九家电影院和文化宫、俱乐部，昨天全天放映反对美帝国主义侵略、抗美援朝的影片。上海人民广播电台举办的广播周，昨天开始以戏曲、诗歌、文艺朗诵、讲演等形式发出了猛攻头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔的怒吼。电视台播送了活报剧“白宫出丑记”、越剧“怒打瘟神”等节目，并且还放映了新近自东京寄来的影片：岸信介集团强行非法“通过”日美安全条约的丑剧和日本人民展开第十六次统一行动时东京二十万人举行大示威的实况。昨天许多工厂的业余文艺工作者也在下班之后和休息时间，演出各种反对美帝国主义斗争的节目。
    晚上，上海市人民沪剧团在全市“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”艺术演出开幕式上演出的沪剧“金黛莱”，全场观众激动万分，大家不禁高呼“打倒美帝国主义”。这出戏是描写一位朝鲜人民的女英雄，为了营救曾经把她从美国侵略军的屠刀下救出来的中国人民志愿军战士岳守营，用手榴弹炸死许多美国鬼子，救出了岳守营。1953年和1955年上海市人民沪剧团曾经几次连续演出，受到观众热烈欢迎。这个剧团，近两天来还自编自导自演了一出新戏“广岛姑娘”，准备上演。
