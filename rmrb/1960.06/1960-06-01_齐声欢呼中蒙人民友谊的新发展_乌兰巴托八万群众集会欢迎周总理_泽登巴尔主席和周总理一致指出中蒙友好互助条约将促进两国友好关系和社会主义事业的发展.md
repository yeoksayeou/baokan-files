Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 31st: Nearly 80,000 people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, held a grand Mongolian-Chinese friendship rally in Sukhbaatar Square this afternoon to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai.

　　Sukhbaatar Square was filled with people carrying huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Tsedenbal, and Chairman Sambuu. The square was decorated with the national flags, red flags, and colorful flags of China and Mongolia. Sukhbaatar Square is where the people of Ulaanbaatar gather every year to celebrate festivals. Today, people gathered in the square as joyfully as if it were a festival to warmly welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal attended the grand rally together after signing the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement, and the joint statement of the two governments. When they ascended the rostrum, nearly 80,000 people cheered enthusiastically in unison, celebrating the new development of Sino-Mongolian friendship. In their speeches at the rally, Chairman Tsedenbal and Premier Zhou Enlai unanimously emphasized that the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance will further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and further promote the development of socialist undertakings in both countries.

　　Vice Premier Chen Yi and all the Chinese comrades attended the rally.

　　Mongolian party and government leaders attending the rally also included Comrades Sambuu, Tsende, Molomjamts, Dugersuren, Jagvaral, Lhamsuren, and Maidar.

　　The grand rally began at 5:40 PM.

　　Chairman Tsedenbal delivered a speech. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the Mongolian People's Republic is of great significance for further consolidating the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation between the people of Mongolia and China. He pointed out that the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance and other documents "are important contributions to further enhancing the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese people, consolidating the friendship of socialist countries, and safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia and the world."

　　Chairman Tsedenbal said that the invincible great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing and consolidating day by day, resolutely implementing a genuine peaceful foreign policy. However, imperialism headed by the United States is intensifying tensions and continuing the policy of the "Cold War" and frenzied arms race. He said that it is necessary to expose the conspiracies of the war instigators, further unite all forces fighting for peace and democracy, and continuously enhance and consolidate the unity of the people of socialist countries.

　　In his speech, Chairman Tsedenbal also enthusiastically praised the achievements made by the Chinese people in their high-speed socialist construction. He said that every great victory of the Chinese people has greatly increased the power of the world socialist system. He concluded by wishing the Chinese people new achievements.

　　In his speech at the rally, Premier Zhou emphasized: "Today, China and Mongolia have signed a Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, which will further strengthen the fraternal relations between our two peoples and further promote the development of socialist undertakings in our two countries. We believe that the signing of this treaty is also of great significance for maintaining peace in Asia and the world."

　　Premier Zhou warmly congratulated the fraternal Mongolian people on the great victories they have achieved in the cause of building their motherland. He said that the Mongolian people have transformed a single pastoral country into a country that emphasizes both agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry. Now, inspired by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's policy of accelerating socialist construction mainly through self-reliance, the Mongolian people have launched a new construction upsurge and are working diligently to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Premier Zhou said that the Mongolian people will surely be able to create new and greater achievements soon by relying on their own hardworking hands.

　　Premier Zhou strongly condemned the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism. He said: "The aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. Even when U.S. imperialism pretends to be peaceful, it has never stopped its frantic arms expansion and war preparations. Recently, after a U.S. spy plane that invaded Soviet territory was shot down by the Soviet Union, the U.S. government blatantly rejected the Soviet government's protests and completely reasonable demands regarding this act of aggression, thereby undermining the highly anticipated four-power summit. Subsequently, the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, forcibly passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through the Japanese House of Representatives illegally. For more than a year, the U.S. Air Force and Navy have continuously violated China's airspace and territorial waters. Until recently, this kind of infringement has reached as many as one hundred times. This series of acts of aggression that undermine world peace once again exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism actively preparing for a war of aggression to the people of the world. These facts make the people of the whole world see the essence of U.S. imperialism more clearly, and at the same time, further see the faces of those imperialist lackeys who have always pretended to be fair. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the solemn measures taken by the Soviet government recently against the provocative crimes of U.S. imperialism." Premier Zhou said: "The life of imperialism will not be long. As long as the people of all countries further unite and form a united front against imperialism, mainly a united front against U.S. imperialism, and carry out resolute struggles, they will surely be able to defeat the aggressive and war policies of imperialism."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: "Let the people of our two countries unite closely and make unremitting efforts to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for lasting world peace."

　　During the speeches of Chairman Tsedenbal and Premier Zhou Enlai, stormy applause and prolonged cheers constantly erupted among the nearly 80,000 people.

　　The grand friendship rally was presided over by Bata, Chairman of the Ulaanbaatar City Executive Committee. After he announced the start of the rally, construction worker Dargaajav, Dashnyam, director of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative, and Nachukdorj, vice chairman of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association, spoke successively. They respectively represented Mongolian workers, herdsmen, and intellectuals in expressing warm welcome and high respect to Premier Zhou Enlai.

　　Dargaajav said that in recent years, he and Chinese workers in Mongolia have worked together, helping and loving each other. He asked the distinguished Chinese guests to convey the sincere respect of the Mongolian workers to the heroic Chinese working class and wished them even more brilliant achievements in socialist construction.

　　In his speech, Dashnyam said that their cooperative, named "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship," well expressed the friendship of the farmers and herdsmen of the two countries who have realized collectivization. He said that our cooperative members regard learning from the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward of the great Chinese people as our important task.

　　In his speech, Nachukdorj expressed his firm belief that the cultural and scientific cooperation between the two countries will be further developed and consolidated.

　　The friendship rally ended amidst the thunderous applause and cheers of nearly 80,000 people. Today, envoys from various countries stationed in Mongolia were also invited to attend the rally.

    齐声欢呼中蒙人民友谊的新发展
    乌兰巴托八万群众集会欢迎周总理
    泽登巴尔主席和周总理一致指出中蒙友好互助条约将促进两国友好关系和社会主义事业的发展
    新华社乌兰巴托31日电　蒙古首都乌兰巴托市各界人民近八万人，今天下午在苏赫巴托尔广场举行盛大的蒙中友谊集会，热烈欢迎周恩来总理。
    苏赫巴托尔广场站满了人群，人们抬着毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、周恩来总理、朱德委员长、泽登巴尔主席、桑布主席的巨幅画像，全场飘扬着中蒙两国的国旗、红旗和彩旗。苏赫巴托尔广场是乌兰巴托市人民每年集会庆祝节日的地方，今天，人们也像过节一样欢乐地聚集在广场上，热烈欢迎中国贵宾。
    周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席在签订了中蒙友好互助条约、经济技术援助协定和两国政府的联合声明以后，一起出席了盛大的集会。当他们登上主席台的时候，近八万人齐声热烈欢呼，庆祝中蒙友谊的新发展。泽登巴尔主席和周恩来总理在大会上的讲话中一致强调指出，中蒙友好互助条约的签订，将进一步加强两国的友好关系，并且将进一步促进两国的社会主义事业的发展。
    陈毅副总理和全体中国同志都出席了大会。
    出席大会的蒙古党和政府的领导人还有桑布、曾德、莫洛姆扎木茨、杜格苏伦、扎格瓦拉尔、拉姆苏伦、迈达尔等同志。
    盛大的集会在五点四十分钟开始。
    泽登巴尔主席讲话。他说，周恩来总理访问蒙古人民共和国对进一步巩固蒙中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和紧密合作具有重要意义。他指出，中蒙友好互助条约等文件的签订，“都是对进一步增进蒙中人民兄弟般的友谊和紧密合作，巩固社会主义各国的友谊，以及维护和巩固亚洲及世界的和平，作出的重要贡献。”
    泽登巴尔主席说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的战无不胜的伟大力量在一天比一天增长和巩固，坚决执行真正的和平外交政策，但是，以美国为首的帝国主义却加剧紧张局势，继续“冷战”和狂热的军备竞赛的政策。他说，必须揭发战争煽动者的阴谋诡计，进一步团结为和平民主而斗争的一切力量，不断地增进和巩固社会主义阵营各国人民的团结。
    泽登巴尔主席在讲话中还热情洋溢地颂扬了中国人民高速度进行社会主义建设所取得的成就。他说，中国人民的每一个巨大胜利都大大增进了世界社会主义体系的威力。他最后祝中国人民取得新的成就。
    周总理在大会上讲话中强调说：“今天，中蒙两国签订了友好互助条约，这将进一步加强我们两国人民亲如手足的关系，并且将进一步促进我们两国的社会主义事业的发展，我们相信，这个条约的签订对于维护亚洲和世界的和平，也有着重大的意义。”
    周总理热烈祝贺兄弟的蒙古人民在建设祖国的事业中所取得的巨大胜利。他说，蒙古人民已经把一个单一的畜牧业国家变成了农牧业和工业并重的国家。现在，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党制定的以自力更生为主加速社会主义建设的方针鼓舞下，已经掀起一个新的建设热潮，为提前完成三年计划进行着辛勤的劳动。周总理说，蒙古人民依靠自己勤劳的双手一定能够很快地创造出新的更大的成绩。
    周总理强烈谴责美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策。他说：“美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。即使在美帝国主义伪装和平的时候，它也从来没有停止过疯狂的扩军备战活动。最近，美国政府在它的侵犯苏联国境的间谍飞机被苏联击落之后，竟悍然拒绝苏联政府对于美国这一侵略行动的抗议和完全合理的要求，因而破坏了举世瞩目的四国政府首脑会议。随着，日本岸信介政府也在美帝国主义的指使下，强迫日本众议院非法通过日美军事同盟条约。一年多以来，美国空军和海军不断侵犯中国的领空和领海。直到最近，这种侵犯行为已经达到一百次之多。这一系列破坏世界和平的侵略罪行，再一次使美帝国主义积极准备侵略战争的丑恶面目在世界人民面前暴露无遗。这些事实使全世界人民更加清楚地看到美帝国主义的本质，同时也进一步看清了那些一向伪装公正的帝国主义奴仆们的嘴脸。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府最近对美帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的严正措施。”周总理说：“帝国主义的寿命不会很久了。只要各国人民进一步团结起来结成反对帝国主义的统一战线，主要是反对美帝国主义的统一战线，进行坚决的斗争，就一定能够击败帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”
    周恩来总理最后说：“让我们两国人民紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略和争取世界持久和平作出坚持不懈的努力。”
    在泽登巴尔主席和周恩来总理讲话的过程中，近八万群众中不断响起暴风雨般的掌声和长时间的欢呼声。
    盛大的友谊集会由乌兰巴托市执行委员会主席巴塔主持。在他宣布大会开始以后，建筑工人达尔哈扎布、蒙中友谊合作社社长达什尼亚姆和蒙中友好协会副主席那楚克道尔吉先后讲了话。他们分别代表蒙古工人、牧民和知识分子向周恩来总理表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    达尔哈扎布说，最近几年，他和在蒙古的中国工人一块工作，互助互爱，他请中国贵宾把蒙古工人热诚的敬意转达给英雄的中国工人阶级，并祝他们在社会主义建设中取得更加辉煌的成就。
    达什尼亚姆在讲话中说，他们的合作社以“蒙中友谊”命名，很好地表达了实现了集体化的两国农、牧民的友谊。他说，我们社员把学习伟大中国人民大跃进的丰富经验，作为自己的重要任务。
    那楚克道尔吉在讲话中表示深信，两国的文化科学合作将进一步发展和巩固。
    友谊集会在近八万群众雷动的掌声和欢呼声中结束。今天，各国驻蒙古的使节也应邀出席了大会。
