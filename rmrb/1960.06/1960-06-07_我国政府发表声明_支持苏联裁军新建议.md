Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China Supporting the New Disarmament Proposal of the Soviet Government
June 6, 1960

    On June 2, 1960, the Soviet government put forward a new proposal on complete and thorough disarmament. This proposal developed the Soviet government's proposal on complete and thorough disarmament put forward on September 18, 1959, adopted some propositions put forward by Western countries in the disarmament negotiations, and is another effort by the Soviet government to strive for disarmament. The Government of the People's Republic of China supports this proposal of the Soviet government.
    History proves that imperialism is unwilling to disarm, especially unwilling to carry out complete and thorough disarmament. Before the Second World War, the Soviet government put forward many disarmament proposals, but they were all rejected by the imperialist countries. Since the end of the Second World War, the Soviet government has repeatedly put forward disarmament proposals, and in order to strive for an agreement on the disarmament issue, it has continuously absorbed the opinions of Western countries on disarmament. However, every time the Soviet government accepted some suggestions from Western countries, the Western countries retreated from their original positions and set up new obstacles. Due to this attitude of the Western countries, the disarmament issue has been discussed for more than ten years, but no results have been achieved so far. In particular, U.S. imperialism pays lip service to disarmament, but in reality, it has been expanding its armaments and expanding its military bases abroad. It does this, on the one hand, to threaten socialist countries, and more importantly, to suppress the movements of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even European countries to win and safeguard national independence and democratic freedom, and to suppress the revolutionary struggles of their own people. Now, the Eisenhower government of the United States, after sabotaging the four-nation summit conference, is using the tension it created to step up its arms expansion and war preparations, and to step up the revival of West German and Japanese militarism. Soviet Premier Khrushchev emphasized in his letter to the heads of government of various countries that the Soviet government is very doubtful whether the Western countries have a desire for disarmament. This is entirely justified.
    We believe that the Soviet government's new disarmament proposal is a test for the imperialist countries, and rejecting this proposal will further expose the peace deception of the imperialist countries headed by the United States. The Soviet government's new disarmament proposal should be a call to the peace-loving people of the world, calling on them to fight against the arms expansion and war preparations of the imperialists headed by the United States, against the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, and for the struggle to win and safeguard national independence and democratic freedom. Only through the unremitting struggle of the people of all countries in the world, and by isolating the imperialists headed by the United States to the greatest extent, is it possible to force the imperialist countries to sit down for serious disarmament negotiations, to postpone or even stop the imperialists' plan to launch a new world war, and to ensure world peace.

    我国政府发表声明  支持苏联裁军新建议
    历史证明，帝国主义是不肯裁军的，特别是绝不肯全面彻底裁军。美帝国主义口头上空谈裁军，实际上却一直在扩充军备，一直在国外扩张军事基地。——帝国主义国家拒绝苏联的新建议，将进一步揭露它们的和平欺骗。——只有经过世界各国人民坚持不懈的斗争，最大限度地孤立以美国为首的帝国主义，才有可能迫使它们坐下来进行认真的裁军谈判。
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于支持苏联政府新的裁军建议的声明　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1960年6月6日
    1960年6月2日，苏联政府提出了关于全面彻底裁军的新的建议。这个建议发展了苏联政府在1959年9月18日提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，采纳了西方国家在裁军谈判中所提出的某些主张，是苏联政府争取实现裁军的又一次努力。中华人民共和国政府支持苏联政府的这个建议。
    历史证明，帝国主义是不肯裁军的，特别是绝不肯全面彻底裁军。第二次世界大战以前，苏联政府就提出过许多裁军建议，但是都遭到帝国主义国家的拒绝。第二次世界大战结束以来，苏联政府又多次提出裁军建议，并且为了争取对裁军问题达成协议，不断吸收西方国家关于裁军的意见。但是，每一次苏联政府接受了西方国家的某些建议，西方国家就从原来的立场后退，重新设置新的障碍。由于西方国家的这种态度，裁军问题谈了十多年了，至今没有得到任何结果。特别是美帝国主义口头上空谈裁军，实际上却一直在扩充军备，一直在国外扩张军事基地。它这样做，一方面是对社会主义国家进行威胁，而更重要的是为了镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲甚至欧洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立和民主自由的运动，镇压本国人民的革命斗争。现在，美国艾森豪威尔政府在破坏了四国政府首脑会议之后，更利用它一手制造出来的紧张局势，加紧扩军备战，加紧复活西德和日本的军国主义。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在致各国政府首脑的信中强调，苏联政府非常怀疑西方国家是否有裁军愿望。这是完全有根据的。
    我们认为，苏联政府的新的裁军建议，是对帝国主义国家的一个考验，拒绝这个建议将进一步揭露以美国为首的帝国主义国家的和平欺骗。苏联政府这个新的裁军建议，对于世界爱好和平的人民，应该是一个号召，号召他们为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的扩军备战、反对复活西德和日本的军国主义、为争取和维护民族独立和民主自由而奋斗。只有经过世界各国人民坚持不懈的斗争，最大限度地孤立以美国为首的帝国主义，才有可能迫使帝国主义国家坐下来进行认真的裁军谈判，才有可能推迟以至制止帝国主义发动新的世界大战的计划，才有可能使世界和平得到保障。
