Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Eloy Torres, Organizing Secretary of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, in his speech at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the 6th, used the example of the Venezuelan people being enslaved by U.S. imperialism to expose that the U.S. implementing so-called "aid to backward countries" in Latin America is to further colonize these countries.

    Torres said that wanting to develop our economy by relying on the aid of U.S. capital (as it is today) is falling into the purest fantasy, because the essence of the imperialist system is to use capital exports to obtain the maximum capitalist profit. According to the laws of capital, the purpose of any U.S. investment is to obtain profit. Therefore, asking for an increase in this investment is to subject our countries to even greater oppression by international capital.

    He said, to confirm this assertion about what U.S. investment means, let's look at the situation in Venezuela:

    Venezuela began extracting oil in 1917, producing 121,000 barrels that year. In 1957, production exceeded one billion barrels. In 1957, the net investment in oil was 8,526 million bolivars (one U.S. dollar equals 3.35 bolivars). It should be pointed out that these billions of bolivars were not taken from the shareholders of the U.S. oil industry, nor were they taken from foreign banks to invest in Venezuela. Only a small part of this money was originally brought to Venezuela, and then rapid reproduction began.

    A comparison should be made between the net profit and the invested capital, and then we will see that: the net profit was 16,281.34 million; the investment was 8,526 million; the difference was 7,755.34 million. It can be seen from this that the net profit exceeded the investment by 7,755.34 million bolivars. From these profits, it can be seen that the exploitation of oil workers is exceptionally harsh.

    Torres said that the above example most clearly illustrates the reason for foreign capital investment in our countries. Can we ask for more American investment in Venezuela?

    He said that, as a supplement to the huge profits obtained in oil extraction, the United States also restricts us with the U.S.-Venezuela bilateral treaty, which forces Venezuela to sell oil, iron, coffee, cocoa, and other raw materials, in exchange for U.S. industrial products entering our ports unhindered. Otherwise, the U.S. will reduce its share of oil imports, thereby reducing Venezuela's fiscal revenue. The United States achieves two goals by this: first, to blackmail the government, so that it acts according to the wishes of the trusts; second, to make the country continue to succumb to the economic demands of these trusts. What would the situation be if the United States increased its investment in our countries? The above situation in Venezuela can reappear in any Latin American country.

    He said that, obviously, the trade union movement should fight for the industrialization of our countries, but the growth of industry we desire should contribute to the independent development of our countries' economies. Our countries' economies are in a state of serious maldevelopment, precisely because foreign investment has entered the economies of various countries, distorting them and making them serve the big investors.

    When talking about the new high tide of the Latin American struggle against U.S. imperialism, Torres said that for the people of Latin American countries, the most effective way to contribute to defeating the threat of the Cold War and hot war is to tirelessly struggle to free our economies from imperialist control and achieve independence, to fight for democratic freedom, and to strive for the unity of all progressive forces in the Latin American continent.

    He said that, in order to accomplish these tasks, the progressive and democratic strata of Latin America must be convinced that they should unite in a single alliance to oppose U.S. rule.

    He emphasized: What we are facing is the increased anti-imperialist awareness in our countries and a new high tide of mass movements, and we cannot let it disappear. The proof of this is the shining example of Cuba. Despite being a small island only sixty miles from the coast of the United States, Cuba has carried out a revolution, which is a living example for the people of our countries. The Cuban revolution is clearly showing that the arguments of those who worship geographical determinism are incorrect; it shows that, under the current historical conditions, it is possible to break free from the shackles of imperialism, and neither geographical location nor the size of the country matters. What is needed now is the determination of the people of all countries to be free people, because the objective conditions for achieving this already exist.

    In the final part of his speech, Torres pointed out that: First, the Latin American trade union movement should become the banner of solidarity for the Latin American republics. Intensify activities to strive for the rapid realization of the unity of the trade unions in our countries. Second, more actively carry out the struggle to defend the Cuban revolution, and regard the Cuban revolution as one of the major steps taken recently on the road to independence for our countries. Third, it is hoped that the World Federation of Trade Unions will carefully study the economic situation in Latin America, so as to put forward specific guidelines for the development of the Latin American trade union movement. Fourth, it is hoped that the World Federation of Trade Unions will provide more assistance to the development of the Latin American trade union movement, so that Latin America can take advantage of the favorable opportunities that may arise in the current situation of increased anti-imperialist awareness and the high tide of mass movements.

### 委内瑞拉工会联合会组织书记托莱斯发言指出  靠“美援”发展经济是纯粹幻想

    委内瑞拉工会联合会组织书记托莱斯发言指出
    靠“美援”发展经济是纯粹幻想
    帝国主义制度的本质是利用资本输出来获得最大限度的利润。要求增加这种投资就是使各国更加遭受国际资本的压迫
    据新华社8日讯　委内瑞拉工人联合会组织书记埃洛伊·托莱斯6日在世界工联理事会会议上发言中，用委内瑞拉的人民被美帝国主义奴役的实例，揭穿了美国在拉丁美洲实行所谓“援助落后国家”，是进一步使这些国家殖民地化。
    托莱斯说，想靠美国资本的援助（如像今天这样）来发展我们的经济，就是陷入了最纯粹的幻想，因为帝国主义制度的本质是利用资本输出来获得最大限度的资本主义利润。根据资本的法则，美国任何投资的目的都是为了获得利润。因此，要求增加这种投资就是使我们各国更加遭受国际资本的压迫。
    他说，为了证实这个关于美国投资意味着什么的论断，让我们来看一看委内瑞拉的情况：
    委内瑞拉1917年开始开采石油，那一年生产了十二万一千桶。1957年产量超过了十亿桶。1957年石油方面的纯投资为八十五亿二千六百万博利瓦尔（一美元等于三点三五博利瓦尔），应该指出，这些数以亿计的钱，不是从美国石油业股东那儿拿出来的，也不是从外国银行那儿拿来投在委内瑞拉的。这些钱中只有很少一点是原先带到委内瑞拉来的，然后就开始了迅速的再生产。
    应该把纯利润和投入的资本做个比较，这样我们就会看到：纯利润为一百六十二亿八千一百三十四万；投资额为八十五亿二千六百万；差额为七十七亿五千五百三十四万。这就可以看出，纯利超过投资七十七亿五千五百三十四万博利瓦尔。从这些利润中可以看出：石油工人所受的剥削是异常苛刻的。
    托莱斯说，上述例子最明显不过地说明了外国资本在我们这些国家投资的原因。难道我们能够要求委内瑞拉有更多的美国投资吗？
    他说，作为在石油开采方面所获得的巨额利润的补充，美国还使我们受到美国——委内瑞拉双边条约的限制，这个条约强迫委内瑞拉卖出石油、铁、咖啡、可可及其他原料，而交换条件却是，美国的工业产品在我国的港口畅通无阻，否则就要削减美国进口石油的份额，从而降低委内瑞拉的财政收入。美国以此达到两个目的：一、向政府进行讹诈，使它根据托辣斯的意愿行事；二、使国家继续屈从这些托辣斯的经济要求。假如美国增加它在我们各国的投资，情况会是怎样的呢？委内瑞拉的上述局面可以在任何拉丁美洲国家中重新出现。
    他说，显然，工会运动应该为我们各国的工业化而斗争，但是，我们所渴望的工业的增长应该有助于我们各国经济的独立发展，我们各国的经济处在严重的畸形发展状态，这恰恰是因为外国投资打入了各国的经济，使各国经济畸形化，使它为大投资家效劳。
    托莱斯在谈到拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义的斗争的新高潮时说，对于拉丁美洲各国人民说来，为击败冷战和热战威胁做出贡献的最有效的形式就是，不倦地进行斗争，争取使我们的经济摆脱帝国主义的控制而获得独立，争取实现民主自由，以及争取实现拉丁美洲大陆目前一切进步势力的团结。
    他说，为了完成这些任务，必须使拉丁美洲的进步和民主阶层深信，他们应该在一个单一的联盟中团结起来，以反对美国的统治。
    他强调指出：我们所面临的是我们各国的反帝国主义觉悟的提高和群众运动的新高潮，我们不能让它消失。这种情况的证明，就是古巴的光辉榜样。古巴尽管是一个距美国海岸只有六十浬的小岛，但它却进行了革命，这个革命是我们各国人民活生生的榜样。古巴革命正在清楚地表明，崇拜地理宿命论的人的辩解是不正确的；这就表明，在目前的历史条件下，摆脱帝国主义的束缚是可能的，无论是地理位置，还是国家的大小都并不重要，现在所需要的是各国人民做自由人民的决心，因为实现这一点的客观条件已经具备。
    托莱斯在发言的最后指出，应该：一，使拉丁美洲的工会运动成为拉丁美洲各共和国团结的旗手。加紧活动，以争取迅速实现我们各国工会的团结。二，更积极地进行保卫古巴革命的斗争，把古巴革命看作最近期间在走向我们各国独立的道路上迈出的重大步伐之一。三、希望世界工联仔细地研究一下拉丁美洲的经济情况，以便提出关于拉丁美洲工会运动发展的具体方针。四，希望世界工联更多地帮助拉丁美洲工会运动的发展，使拉丁美洲得以利用目前反帝觉悟提高和群众运动高涨的情况下可能出现的有利时机。
