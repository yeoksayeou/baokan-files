Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Tokyo: The north and south routes of the Japanese people's ten-thousand-kilometer peace march against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," against Japan's nuclear armament, and demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, continue to advance towards Tokyo.

The south route group arrived in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, on the 7th, where they were welcomed by 600 citizens. The marchers and the citizens who welcomed them held a demonstration near the U.S. Air Force base in Iwakuni, demanding that the United States remove the Iwakuni nuclear weapons base and withdraw U-2 spy planes.

The Iwakuni base houses U.S. aircraft capable of carrying atomic bombs, and it was an outpost base during the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea.

Fifteen representatives of the march met with U.S. military officers at the Iwakuni base and handed them a letter of protest.

The north route group, which departed from northern Japan, arrived in Hakodate City at the southern tip of Hokkaido on June 3rd. Before they reached Hakodate City, the marching group had increased to three thousand people. As they continued their journey from Hakodate towards Tokyo, more and more people joined their ranks, and approximately seven thousand people gathered to welcome the marching group.

This peace march is being organized by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Both marching groups are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on August 6th to participate in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Tokyo: Another route of the Japanese people's national march against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" began today.

Two hundred marchers departed from Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture, today for Tokyo, shouting slogans such as: "Stop the ratification of the new Security Treaty!" "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" "Dissolve the Diet!" "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!"

The marchers distributed leaflets to passersby along the way. Leading the march was Socialist Party Councilor Shigeaki Aizawa. Among the marchers were representatives from Kumamoto and Wakayama Prefectures.

This marching group is one of six routes launched by the Japan "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty." The other five routes depart from Tochigi, Gunma, Ibaraki, Yamanashi, and Chiba Prefectures, respectively. All routes will arrive in Tokyo on the 11th to participate in a national rally against the "Security Treaty." The demands of this major march are: abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," dissolve the Diet, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and cancel U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Marchers from Tochigi, Gunma, and Ibaraki Prefectures had already set out on the 7th, and marchers from Yamanashi Prefecture also departed for Tokyo today. The marchers from Chiba Prefecture plan to depart on the 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Tokyo: The "Hiroshima Prefecture Atomic Bomb Victims Group Council" secretariat unanimously passed a letter of request to Eisenhower on June 4th, asking him to cancel his trip to Japan.

The letter pointed out, "When the United States dropped the world's first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, it committed the most serious crime against humanity."

The letter said, "We cannot help but worry that your visit will promote Japan's nuclear armament and militarization, which we atomic bomb victims can never allow."

Three atomic bomb survivors from Nagasaki went to Tokyo on the 8th to express their opposition to U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

These three people are Kenji Yamaguchi (transliteration) of the "Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Victims Youth Association," Kanayo Sugiyama (transliteration) of the "Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Victims Mothers Association," and Takako Fukuda (transliteration) of the "Nagasaki City Nishimachi Atomic Bomb Victims Association." They plan to meet with U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty, who will be arriving in Japan to arrange Eisenhower's visit, at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, and hand him a letter of request opposing Eisenhower's visit.

They also plan to participate, as representatives of Nagasaki atomic bomb victims, in the protest rally of the 18th unified action against the new "Security Treaty" to be held on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: The Kyushu Regional Council meeting convened by the All Japan Farmers Associations Federation in Fukuoka City passed a letter of protest to Kishi Nobusuke on the 9th, declaring the new "Security Treaty" and the "resolution" to extend the Diet session, which the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly "passed" in the Diet using violence, invalid, and simultaneously demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

The meeting also passed a letter of protest to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanding that he immediately cancel his visit to Japan and opposing "trade liberalization" that includes the import of surplus U.S. agricultural products.

The president of the Japan National Farmers Association, Masaru Nozoe, and approximately forty representatives from various prefectures in Kyushu participated in the meeting. They discussed future farmers' movements. As a result of the consultation, it was decided that the future direction of the farmers' movement would include: firmly opposing the new "Security Treaty," opposing "trade liberalization," and launching a national movement demanding the enactment of a "Farmers Association Law," etc.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese scientists and figures in the literary and artistic circles are actively taking action and bravely joining the anti-American, anti-Kishi political struggle.

Shinichiro Tomonaga, a renowned Japanese atomic physicist and president of Tokyo University of Education, emphasized at a conference held at the university today that the time has come when natural scientists cannot ignore political issues. He said that merely abolishing nuclear weapons will not eliminate war, and the central issue is the political system. He said that natural scientists have an obligation to prevent all systems leading to war, and the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is establishing a system leading to war.

Approximately three hundred professors and associate professors, including Professor Osamu Komaki of Tokyo University of Education, also issued a statement opposing the House of Representatives' forceful "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" and declaring that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is unwelcome.

Approximately five hundred musicians and music critics, including Japanese pianist Motoaki Iguchi, held a rally in Tokyo today demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. The rally passed a resolution stating that the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcing a vote on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives is a violation of the Constitution.

After the meeting, these musicians held a demonstration, singing songs they composed against the new "Security Treaty," and marched all the way to the Diet.

The Association of Scholars and Researchers for the Defense of Democracy also gathered today and decided to launch an action plan demanding the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. This plan stipulates that a marching group composed of professors, associate professors, and lecturers from various universities and research institutes in Tokyo will hold a demonstration by car in Tokyo on the 12th, demanding the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. It was also decided to distribute 300,000 leaflets demanding the dissolution of the Diet to rural areas. Hiromi Arisawa, president of Hosei University in Japan, and twenty scholars, including renowned scientist Hideki Yukawa, will participate in the compilation of these leaflets.

The plan also stipulates that, regarding the issue of opposing President Eisenhower's visit to Japan, each university will submit a public letter of inquiry to Eisenhower through the U.S. Embassy.

    南路队伍7日到达山口县岩国市时，受到了六百名市民的欢迎。游行者和欢迎他们的市民们一起在岩国美国空军基地附近举行示威，要求美国撤除岩国核武器基地，撤走U—2型间谍飞机。

    这次和平大游行是由日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会主持举行的。两路游行队伍预定在8月6日到达东京，参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对日美“安全条约”国民大游行今天又有一路开始出发。
    两百名游行者今天从神奈川县的小田原市出发前往东京，他们高呼：“阻止批准新安全条约！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”“解散国会！”“反对艾森豪威尔访问日本！”等口号。
    游行者沿途向过路人散发了传单。走在游行队伍前列的是社会党参议员相泽重明。在游行者队伍中有来自熊本县与和歌山县的代表。
    这支游行队伍是日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”发起的六路游行队伍之一。另外五路分别从枥木、群马、茨城、山梨和千叶等县出发。各路队伍都将在11日抵达东京，参加反对“安全条约”的全国大会。这次大游行的要求是：废除日美“安全条约”，解散国会，推翻岸信介内阁和取消美国总统艾森豪威尔对日本的访问。
    枥木、群马和茨城等三个县的游行者已经在7日出发，山梨县的游行者也于今天动身前往东京。千叶县的游行者们计划在9日出发。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本“广岛县原子弹受害者团体协议会”事务局6月4日一致通过了一封给艾森豪威尔的要求书，要求他取消日本之行。
    要求书指出，“美国在广岛投下世界上第一颗原子弹的时候，就对人类犯下了最严重的罪行”。
    要求书说，“我们不能不耽心：你的访问将促进日本的核武装化和军国主义化，这是我们原子弹受害者决不能容许的”。
    日本长崎的三个原子弹受害者8日前往东京，表示反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    这三个人是“长崎原子弹受害者青年男女协议会”的山口健二（译音）、“长崎原子弹受害者母亲协议会”的杉山加奈代（译音）和长崎市西町“原子弹受害者协议会”的福田高子（译音）。他们准备在东京羽田机场会见即将到日本安排艾森豪威尔访日事宜的美国总统新闻秘书长哈格蒂，把一项反对艾森豪威尔访日的要求书交给他。
    他们还准备以长崎原子弹受害者代表的身份，参加将在11日举行的反对新“安全条约”第十八次统一行动的抗议大会。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：全日本农民协会联合会在福冈市召集的九州地区协议会会议在9日通过给岸信介的抗议书，宣布岸信介集团用暴力在国会强行“通过”的新“安全条约”和延长国会会期的“决议”无效，同时要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。
    会议还通过了给美国总统艾森豪威尔的抗议书，要求他立即取消访日计划，并且反对以进口美国剩余农产品为内容的“贸易自由化”。
    日本全国农民协会会长野沟胜以及九州各县代表约四十人参加了会议。他们就今后的农民运动进行了协商。协商的结果，决定今后农民运动的方针包括：坚决反对新“安全条约”，反对“贸易自由化”，开展要求制定“农民协会法”的全国运动等等。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本科学家和文学艺术界人士纷纷行动起来，奋勇投入反美反岸的政治斗争。
    日本著名原子物理学家、东京教育大学校长朝永振一郎今天在教育大学举行的大会上强调指出，目前已经到了自然科学家不能不过问政治问题的时候了。他说，只靠废除核武器，是不会消除战争的，中心问题是政治制度问题。他说，自然科学家有义务阻止所有通往战争的制度，而新日美“安全条约”就是在建立通往战争的制度。
    东京教育大学教授小牧治等教授和副教授约三百人还发表了一项声明，反对众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”，并且宣布艾森豪威尔的访日是不受人欢迎的。
    日本钢琴家井口基成等音乐家和音乐评论家约五百人今天在东京举行要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会大会。大会通过决议说，岸信介集团强使众议院表决新日美“安全条约”，是违反宪法的。
    这些音乐家在会后唱着自己作的反对新“安全条约”的歌曲举行了示威游行，一直走到国会。
    学者和研究工作者保卫民主协会也在今天集会，决定开展要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会的行动计划。这项计划规定，由东京各大学和研究所的教授、副教授、讲师等组成的游行队伍，将在12日乘汽车在东京举行示威，要求岸信介内阁总辞职。另外还决定向农村散发三十万张要求解散国会的传单。日本法政大学校长有泽广已、著名科学家汤川秀树等二十名学者将参加编制这批传单。
