Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, spoke at a rally held by the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in support of the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu" from the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Liao Chengzhi said: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee fully supports the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu" issued by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and pays tribute to the heroic artillerymen and all the commanders and fighters on the Fujian Front. Their angry bombardment of the "plague god" is a stern warning to the American imperialist aggressors. Eisenhower, the chieftain of American imperialism, the number one enemy of all the Chinese people and the people of the world, this dirty executioner, shamelessly climbed from the Philippines onto Taiwan, our territory. We feel great anger and express strong protest.

He said: The Chinese people have long seen through Eisenhower's bandit face. Recently, he single-handedly sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference and was severely condemned by the people of the world. This time, he went to the Far East for a so-called "visit" amid the opposition of the broad masses of Asian people, continuing to intensify the tense situation, preparing for a new war of aggression, and attempting to further oppress and enslave the Asian people. Obviously, Eisenhower's purpose in "visiting" Taiwan is to further promote "two Chinas" and realize the conspiracy to permanently occupy our Taiwan. This is another intolerable provocation against our 650 million Chinese people. This once again exposes the aggressive and bellicose nature of American imperialism, which is determined to be the enemy of the Chinese people and the Asian people. Eisenhower's bandit trip can only more thoroughly expose the guise of American "false peace, genuine war preparation," and can only further arouse the anti-American struggle of the Chinese people and the Asian people to a new climax.

Liao Chengzhi said: Wherever Eisenhower, this "plague god," goes, disaster follows, and the people there rise up to attack him. This time we have already seen that the Filipino people "welcomed" him with stones as gifts; in Japan, the struggle against Eisenhower's visit and against American imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi has formed an unprecedentedly huge nationwide wave of anger. Under the fierce impact of this wave of anger, Eisenhower was forced to announce the postponement of his visit to Japan. This is a major victory for the Japanese people's just patriotic anti-American struggle. The people of Okinawa Island, occupied by the United States, and the heroic people of South Korea are on high alert, ready to severely teach Eisenhower a lesson. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of Japan, South Korea, and Asian countries against the bandit Eisenhower and American imperialism.

Liao Chengzhi said: While American imperialism is expanding its military bases everywhere in Asia, using aggressive blocs, carrying out subversive activities, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and plotting war conspiracies, it is also stepping up its large-scale invasion and expansion into Africa politically, militarily, economically, and culturally. Its purpose is to replace the position of the old colonial powers, dominate Africa, and exploit the African people. However, the plunder and suppression of the Asian and African people by American imperialism and its running dogs has caused a huge anti-American storm to sweep fiercely across the entire Asian and African continent from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan of China, the Philippines, Turkey, all the way to Algeria and Morocco. The resolution passed at the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, strongly condemned American imperialism for invading the Asian and African people, and resolutely supported the anti-American just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. This is the common will and fighting call of the Asian and African people.

He said: American imperialism has occupied our Taiwan for ten years. For ten years, American imperialism has continuously used Taiwan as a springboard for further military provocations and various espionage activities against our mainland, creating tension and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. American soldiers and secret agents have run rampant, committing all kinds of evils, turning Taiwan into a hell on earth. The day when the entire Chinese people settle accounts with the American robbers must come.

He said: The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and must accomplish the great cause of the unification of the motherland. If American imperialism does not get out of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu as soon as possible, the great Chinese people will definitely drive the invaders back to their old home. We extend our infinite sympathy and concern to the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu who are living a dark life under the American butcher knife. We firmly support their just struggle against the bandit Eisenhower's trip. The Taiwan compatriots, who have a glorious tradition of anti-American patriotic struggle, should unite closely, act powerfully, oppose the warmonger Eisenhower, and fight the American aggressors to the end. We must also advise those who are willing to be slaves to the United States that if they are stubborn and refuse to turn back, they will surely suffer the same fate as the old American running dogs Syngman Rhee and Menderes, who were overthrown by the people, and become infamous for thousands of years.

Liao Chengzhi said: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee declares that the Chinese people will strengthen solidarity with the people of South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Asian and African countries with greater determination and strength, support each other, and carry out the just struggle against American imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace until the final and complete victory is won.

### 中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志讲话  亚非人民团结起来，同美国侵略者斗争到底

    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志讲话
    亚非人民团结起来，同美国侵略者斗争到底
    新华社18日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在中国亚非团结委员会拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”的集会上讲了话。
    廖承志说：中国亚非团结委员会完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部发表的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，并向福建前线的祖国英雄的炮兵和全体指战员致敬，他们怒轰“瘟神”的炮声，是对美帝国主义侵略者的严正警告。美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔，这个全中国人民和全世界人民的头号敌人，这个肮脏的刽子手厚颜无耻地从菲律宾爬上了我国领土台湾，我们感到极大的愤怒和表示强烈的抗议。
    他说：艾森豪威尔的强盗面目，中国人民早已看穿了。最近他一手破坏了四国政府首脑会议，受到全世界人民的严厉谴责。这次他又在广大亚洲人民的反对声中到远东地区进行所谓“访问”旅行，继续加剧紧张局势，准备新的侵略战争，企图进一步压迫和奴役亚洲人民。很明显，艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾的目的，还想加紧推行“两个中国”和实现永久霸占我国台湾的阴谋，这是对我们六亿五千万中国人民又一次不可容忍的挑衅行为。这再一次暴露了美帝国主义坚决同中国人民和亚洲人民为敌的侵略和好战本性。艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，只能更彻底揭露美国的“假和平、真备战”的幌子，只能更激起中国人民和亚洲人民反美斗争走向新的高潮。
    廖承志说：艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”到那里，灾难就到那里，那里的人民就群起攻之。这次我们已经看到，菲律宾人民以石块为礼物来“欢迎”他；在日本，反对艾森豪威尔访问和反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的斗争，形成了全民性的空前的巨大怒潮。在这个怒潮的猛烈冲击下，艾森豪威尔被迫宣布延期访问日本。这是日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的一次重大胜利。被美国侵占的日本冲绳岛人民和英勇的南朝鲜人民正严阵以待，准备狠狠地教训艾森豪威尔。中国人民坚决支持日本、南朝鲜和亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗和美帝国主义的正义斗争。
    廖承志说：美帝国主义在亚洲到处扩建军事基地，利用侵略集团，进行颠复活动，干涉别国内政和策划战争阴谋的同时，也正加紧从政治、军事、经济、文化各方面大举向非洲侵入和扩张，其目的是要取代老牌殖民国家的地位，独霸非洲，压榨非洲人民。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗们对亚非人民的掠夺和镇压，使巨大的反美斗争风暴从南朝鲜、日本、中国台湾、菲律宾、土耳其一直到阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥，猛烈地席卷整个亚非大陆。不久前，在几内亚首都科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会上所通过的决议，强烈谴责了美帝国主义侵略亚非人民，坚决支持朝鲜、日本、越南等亚非各国人民的反美正义斗争，这是亚非人民的共同意志和战斗的呼声。
  他说：美帝国主义霸占我国台湾已十年了。十年来，美帝国主义不断地以台湾作为进一步向我国大陆进行军事挑衅和各种间谍活动的跳板，制造紧张局势，威胁远东和世界和平，美军官兵和特务横行霸道，杀人放火无恶不作，把台湾变成了一个人间大地狱。全中国人民同美国强盗算总账的日子一定就要到来。
    他说：中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马，一定要完成伟大的祖国统一事业。美帝国主义如不早日从台、澎、金、马滚出去，伟大的中国人民一定要把侵略者赶回老家去。我们对于在美国屠刀下过着暗无天日的生活的台、澎、金、马爱国同胞，寄以无限的同情和关怀。我们坚决支持他们反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。有着反美爱国斗争光荣传统的台湾同胞们，应该紧密地团结起来，有力地行动起来，反对战争贩子艾森豪威尔，同美国侵略者斗争到底。我们也要忠告那些甘心给美国当奴隶的人，如果死心塌地老不回头，一定像被人民轰下台的美国老走狗李承晚、曼德列斯之流一样身败名裂，遗臭万年。
    廖承志说：中国亚非团结委员会声明，中国人民将以更大的决心和力量来和南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾及亚非各国人民加强团结，互相支持，把反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的正义斗争进行到取得最后的、彻底的胜利。
