    Birthday Celebration
    Nangang
    Some time ago, I went to Heshi People's Commune in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, on business and happened to catch the Third Team's public canteen celebrating the 100th birthday of a commune member, Cao Zhennv.

    Cao Zhennv was born into a poor peasant family. The old woman worked diligently all her life and suffered a lot in the old society. Because her son joined the New Fourth Army, the Kuomintang reactionaries arrested the old woman and beat her black and blue, but the old woman never revealed her son's whereabouts.

    After liberation, the old woman's family no longer had to worry about food and clothing. Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune and the public canteen, the old woman lived more comfortably. She often helped watch the canteen door, and sometimes helped sweep the floor and do some light work around her. When the cadres advised her to rest, she always said with a smile, "I've been busy all my life, I feel uncomfortable when I'm idle!"

    This year, celebrating the old woman's 100th birthday, the public canteen specially held a birthday celebration for her. On this day, the old woman wore a black felt hat, a light blue new jacket, and carried a cane, walking into the canteen. Everyone rushed to wish the old woman a happy birthday, and the entire canteen seemed extraordinarily lively. The old woman was also particularly happy that day, eating more than two bowls of "longevity noodles." On this day, Huang Rongcheng, the secretary of the commune party committee, also made a special trip to attend the birthday celebration, and wrote a poem on the spot to congratulate the old woman, saying:

    Old society,
    Cattle and horse lives, precarious,
    New era,
    Happy paradise, boundless longevity.

    Hong Qiaozhu, a Young Pioneer from Hetou Elementary School, embroidered a "Boundless Longevity" handkerchief and gave it to the old woman, saying:

    A thousand little hearts and a pair of hands,
    We embroidered the handkerchief ourselves,
    Grandma, grandma, please accept it,
    Happiness without bounds, eternal longevity.

    The old woman's sixty-six-year-old son, He Tongwen, thought of the past and the present, and was filled with emotion. He said:

    Reactionaries go to the countryside like tigers and wolves,
    Causing families to be destroyed and people to flee,
    Cattle and horse lives are like hell,
    Still makes me tearful to this day.

    The Communist Party came like a loving mother,
    Life is improving and people are healthy,
    The People's Commune is better than paradise,
    Every year is stronger than the last!

    The old woman's forty-two-year-old grandson, He Chengshan, said:

    Grandmother is one hundred years old today,
    Healthy body and energetic spirit.
    The public canteen comes to celebrate her birthday,
    Thank you, benefactor, Communist Party.

    Finally, the production team leader, He Rongcheng, presented the old woman with a Chinese evergreen and congratulated her, saying:

    Centenarian celebrates a great occasion,
    The public canteen is filled with joy,
    Wishing the old woman eternal spring,
    A hundred years, a thousand autumns, forever green!

    The old woman immediately led her grandchildren to the front of the canteen door, personally broke the soil and planted this Chinese evergreen, and her grandchildren delivered a reply on her behalf, saying:

    Plant this Chinese evergreen,
    The People's Commune has taken root,
    The sunshine of communism shines,
    The older the old woman gets, the younger she becomes!

    祝寿
    南岗
    前些时候，我到江苏泰兴县河失公社去办事，恰好赶上三泽大队的一个公共食堂为一个社员百岁老人——曹珍女祝寿。
    曹珍女出生在一个贫农家庭里。老人一生勤勤恳恳，在旧社会受过很多苦。因为儿子当新四军，国民党反动派曾把老人抓去打得鼻青眼肿，但老人始终没有肯说出儿子的下落。
    解放后，老人一家再也不用耽心衣食无着了。特别成立人民公社办了公共食堂以后，老人家过得更舒坦，经常帮食堂看门，有时还帮助扫扫地，干些身边轻活。干部们劝她休息，她总是笑滋滋地说：“我忙了一世，闲着就难过！”
    今年喜逢老人百岁大庆，公共食堂特地为老人家举行祝寿。这天老人头戴黑毡绒帽，身穿淡蓝色新褂，手执拐杖，走进食堂，大家抢着给老人家拜寿，整个食堂显得分外热闹。老人家这天也特别高兴，吃了两碗多“长寿面”。在这一天公社党委书记黄荣成同志，也特地赶来参加祝寿会，并当场写诗向老人祝贺说：
    旧社会，
    牛马生活，朝不保夕，
    新时代，
    幸福天堂，万寿无疆。
    河头小学少先队员洪巧珠，绣了一块“万寿无疆”的手帕，送给老人家说：
    千颗小心一双手，
    手帕我们亲手绣，
    奶奶奶奶把它收，
    幸福无疆永长寿。
    老人六十六岁的儿子何同文想起过去和现在，心中激动不已，他说：
    反动派下乡似虎狼，
    闹得家破人逃亡，
    牛马生活似地狱，
    至今想起泪汪汪。
    共产党来了赛亲娘，
    生活向上人安康，
    人民公社胜天堂，
    一年更比一年强！
    老人四十二岁的孙子何承三说：
    祖母今天一百岁，
    身体健壮精神爽。
    公共食堂来祝寿，
    感谢恩人共产党。
    最后，生产队长何荣成向老人献了一棵万年青，并向老人祝贺说：
    百岁老人逢大庆，
    公共食堂齐欢腾，
    祝贺老人春常在，
    百岁千秋万年青！
    老人当即领着孙孙走到食堂门前，亲手破土，栽下这棵万年青，并由孙孙代致答词说：
    栽下这棵万年青，
    人民公社生了根，
    共产主义阳光照，
    老人越活越年轻！
