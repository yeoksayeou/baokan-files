This newspaper reported from Xining on June 22nd: In the field management campaign centered on weeding, Qinghai Province's thousands of high-yield plots of spring wheat, highland barley, rapeseed, and other crops are taking the lead, managing early, managing quickly, managing meticulously, and managing skillfully, significantly playing an exemplary role and driving all cultivated land to strive for greater harvests. Due to the promotion of high-yield plot management experience, the percentage of first and second-class seedlings in Minhe County's 300,000 mu of early-maturing crops has rapidly increased from 50% to 98%, with generally more seedlings, stronger seedlings, more tillers, and stronger tillers. Although Ulan County in the pastoral area has greatly expanded its planting area, its field management work has become more and more detailed under the guidance of high-yield plots. First-class seedlings now account for 82% of the total planting area, laying a good foundation for an even greater harvest this year.

Last year, Qinghai Province launched a high-yield campaign for irrigated land to yield 1,000 jin per mu and mountain land to yield 500 jin per mu. Among the 3 million mu of wheat crops, 830,000 mu achieved a yield of 400 jin per mu, and more than 40,000 mu achieved yields of 1,000 jin or even 2,000 jin per mu. This year's high-yield plot campaign is based on the experimental fields and high-yield fields of the past two years. Now, high-yield plots are scattered all over the province, covering agricultural and pastoral areas, irrigated and mountain land, newly reclaimed and old cultivated land, including various crops such as spring wheat, highland barley, and rapeseed. The total area accounts for about 29% of the total planting area. These high-yield plots are contiguous, with large plots of thousands of mu and small plots of hundreds of mu. Generally, agricultural infrastructure construction of a relatively high standard has been carried out. In many areas, the land has been converted into garden-like fields, and the planting area has been divided, the crops have been improved, the density has been reasonably increased, the fertilization has been rationalized, and the irrigation canals have been networked. Furthermore, "command posts" have been generally established within the high-yield plots to conduct single or comprehensive agricultural scientific research through the "command posts" to guide the implementation of scientific management of the high-yield plots.

In order to strengthen the field management of high-yield plots, all people's communes have generally adopted measures such as strengthening organizational leadership, improving management institutions, implementing planned management, and implementing production responsibility systems. The Nianbo Commune in Ledu County, with the Party Committee as the core, and cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians "three-in-one," established a high-yield plot management committee, adopting the leadership method of "four unified" (unified command, unified planning, unified measures, unified action) and "three divisions" (division investment, division management, division harvest) to uniformly lead the management of high-yield plots in the entire commune.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Broad masses of commune members in Hubei Province have overcome the threat of drought and achieved a complete victory in mid-season rice transplanting. As of June 16, the province's transplanted mid-season rice area has expanded by 20% compared to last year. Currently, all regions are continuing to expand the transplanting area while strengthening field management such as topdressing fertilizer, weeding, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests.

This year, Hubei Province experienced a prolonged period without rain during the tense mid-season rice transplanting period, and drought occurred in most areas north of the Yangtze River, with many mid-season rice fields lacking water for transplanting. The heroic people of Hubei, who had been tested by the hundred-day drought last year, immediately rose up to fight the drought. Cadres at all levels in drought-stricken areas went deep into the front lines of drought resistance, leading the broad masses of commune members to dam rivers and build embankments, and water fields with waterwheels. After the drought occurred in Jingmen County, more than 4,000 cadres and more than 10,000 commune members in the county led the effort to resist drought and transplant rice on more than 72,000 mu and pump water to irrigate more than 23,000 mu in three days. After fully mobilizing the masses to seize water sources in every possible way and resisting drought and transplanting rice, Anlu County, which was severely affected by the drought, increased its mid-season rice transplanting area by 10,000 mu compared to the original plan.

Hubei Province has a large area of mid-season rice, and the yield is high. It has always been a major grain crop. Therefore, striving for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice is the key to increasing grain production throughout the year in this province. In order to ensure that mid-season rice is planted more, harvested more, and yields are high, all regions have paid attention to transplanting and management at the same time, transplanting while managing.

    用丰产方生产经验带动方外田
    青海春播作物管理块块细致
    湖北中稻已插面积比去年增百分之二十
    本报西宁22日电　在以除草为中心的田间管理运动中，青海省千万块春小麦、青稞、油菜等各类作物的丰产方一马当先，管早、管快、管精、管巧，显著地发挥了标兵作用，带动着一切耕地争取多收。民和县由于推广了丰产方的管理经验，在三十多万亩早田作物中，一、二类苗已经由50％迅速增加到98％，普遍苗多、苗壮、蘖多、蘖壮。牧业区的乌兰县虽然大量扩大了播种面积，但由于在丰产方的带动下，田间管理工作越做越细，一类苗已占到总播种面积的82％，为今年更大的丰收打下了良好基础。
    去年，青海省开展了川水地千斤、山地五百斤的丰产运动，在三百多万亩麦类作物中有八十三万亩获得亩产四百斤的产量，还有四万多亩亩产达到千斤、双千斤以上。今年的丰产方运动就是在过去两年的试验田和丰产田的基础上发展起来的。现在全省丰产方星罗棋布，遍及农业区和牧业区、川地和山地、新垦地和老耕地，包括春小麦、青稞、油菜等各种作物；全部面积约占总播种面积的29％。这些丰产方土地连片，大方千亩，小方百亩，一般都进行了标准较高的农田基本建设，不少地区还实现了土地园田化、种植区划化、作物良种化、合理密植化、施肥合理化、灌溉渠网化，并且普遍在丰产方内建立了“指挥方”，通过“指挥方”进行单项的或综合性的农业科学研究，指导丰产方实行科学管理。
    为了加强丰产方的田间管理工作，各人民公社都普遍采取加强组织领导、健全管理机构、实行计划管理和生产责任制等措施。乐都县碾伯公社以党委为核心，干部、老农、技术员“三结合”，成立了丰产方管理委员会，采取“四统”（统一指挥、统一规划、统一措施、统一行动）、“三分”（分队投资、分队管理、分队收获）的领导方法，统一领导全社丰产方的管理工作。
    新华社武汉讯　湖北省广大公社社员战胜干旱威胁，获得中稻插秧全胜。到6月16日止，全省已插的中稻面积比去年扩大了20％。目前，各地正一面继续扩大插秧面积，一面加强中稻追肥、薅草、防治病虫等田间管理工作。
    今年湖北省正值中稻紧张插秧期间久晴不雨，长江以北大部地区出现旱象，不少中稻田里缺水插秧。经过去年百日大旱考验的英勇的湖北人民，立即奋起和干旱作斗争。受旱地区的各级干部纷纷深入抗旱前线，领导广大社员拦河筑坝、车水灌田。荆门县旱象发生后，全县四千多名干部领导一万多社员，三天中抗旱插秧七万二千多亩，提水灌田二万三千多亩。旱情较重的安陆县，经过充分发动群众千方百计大抓水源，抗旱插秧后，使全县中稻插秧面积比原计划增加了一万亩。
    湖北省的中稻面积大，产量高，历来是主要粮食作物，因此，争取中稻丰收，是这个省全年粮食增产的关键。为了保证中稻多种多收，高产多收，各地在插秧同时，都注意做到边插、边管。
