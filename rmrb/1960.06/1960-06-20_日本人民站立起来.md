The Japanese People Stand Up
Ruan Zhangjing

	1. June roses, crimson wreaths. Youth's fresh blood, splattered red on Tokyo! Blood debts, must be repaid in blood! The young lives buried in the earth, must use the blood of war criminals to mix the mortar for the altar! Michiko Kamba is not dead, she has transformed into an angry rocket, spewing flames, calling for freedom, charging towards fascism!

	2. June 15th in Tokyo, shook heaven and earth, moved gods and demons! Heroic Japanese sons and daughters, blocking the butcher's blade shouted: "Forward! Step on my blood to rush forward! Lying on the blood-stained ground shouted: "Forward! Step on my body to rush forward!" June 15th in Tokyo, shook heaven and earth, moved gods and demons! The land of Japan is in labor pains, an independent Japan is about to be born!

	3. "Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!" The "Internationale," stepping on the blood-soaked path of heroes, advances! "Arise, ye wretched of the earth!" The "Internationale," stepping over the bodies of heroes, advances! The Pacific Ocean splits, the East Sea's water is cut off, the high mountains give way to a great road, the stars concentrate a thousand years of glory: Let the whole world see—a heroic Japan, standing up!

	4. Bloody Wednesday, a new account written in blood: America, leading Kishi Nobusuke, bloodbathed Wednesday!—Bloody Wednesday, must be repaid in blood! The power of revenge rises, overturning the Pacific Ocean!

	5. To the heroes who died fighting for independence, the people of the world offer their condolences! Beside the molten steel-like pool of blood, watch the butcher Kishi Nobusuke, kneel before the steel sword! Eisenhower has already been frightened on the reviewing stand of the parade in the Philippines! The heroes who fight for freedom are the example for oppressed nations. Their heroic figures, like bronze statues, have already been erected in the hearts of the people!

	6. June roses, crimson wreaths. Bloody Wednesday, must be repaid in blood! The road forged by fresh blood, resounding with majestic footsteps—forward to victory! Forward to final victory!

    日本人民站立起来
    阮章竞
    一六月的玫瑰，殷红的花圈。青年的鲜血，溅红了东京！血债，要用血来还！埋进土里的青春生命，要用战争罪犯的血，来和泥砌祭坛！桦美智子没有死，她化作愤怒的火箭，喷射着烈焰，呼唤着自由，向法西斯冲刺！
    二六月十五日的东京，惊天地，泣鬼神！英勇的日本儿女，挡着屠夫的刀刃呼喊：“前进！踏着我的血迹冲上去！躺在血染的地上呼喊：“前进！踏着我的身体冲上去！”六月十五日的东京，惊天地，泣鬼神！日本的国土在阵疼，独立的日本要诞生！
    三“起来，饥寒交迫的奴隶！”“国际歌”，踏着勇士的血路，向前进！“起来，全世界的罪人！”“国际歌”，跨过勇士的身体，向前进！太平洋裂开，东海水，水断流，高山让出大路繁星集中千年的光耀：让全世界看见——一个英雄的日本，站立起来了！
    四血的星期三，新的一笔血写的账：美国牵着岸信介，血洗星期三！——血的星期三，必须用血还！复仇的威力抬起、掀翻太平洋！
    五为独立战斗而死的勇士，世界人民为你致哀！在熔钢似的血泊旁边，看屠夫岸信介，将在钢剑前面跪下来！艾森豪威尔已经在菲律宾吓倒在阅兵的检阅台！为自由而战斗的勇士，是被压迫民族的榜样。英姿飒飒的铜像，已经竖在人民的心上！
    六六月的玫瑰，殷红的花圈。血的星期三，必须用血还！鲜血冲出的大路，响着雄壮脚音——向胜利前进！向最后的胜利前进！
