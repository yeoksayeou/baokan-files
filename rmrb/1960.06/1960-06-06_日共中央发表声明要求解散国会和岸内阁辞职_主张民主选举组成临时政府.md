    Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Issues Statement Demanding Dissolution of Diet and Resignation of Kishi Cabinet
    Advocates Democratic Elections to Form Interim Government
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee's Presidium issued a statement on May 31st - "Demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the implementation of elections by an election oversight cabinet composed of the entire Diet force, excluding the Kishi group." The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Prime Minister Kishi has shown no remorse for his tyrannical behavior. In press conferences and television programs, he said, "What would happen if I resign?" He is desperately trying to strengthen his threatening attitude. However, we must emphasize again: Kishi must abandon this extremely arrogant attitude and resign immediately. If Kishi resigns, an election oversight cabinet must be formed by the entire Diet force, excluding the Kishi group which engaged in tyrannical behavior - the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and all those within the Liberal Democratic Party who support Kishi's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet. This cabinet's minimum goal would be to conduct elections in a democratic manner and to dissolve the Diet.
    At this time, within the Liberal Democratic Party, all those who have criticized Kishi's tyrannical behavior and feel dissatisfied should not stubbornly adhere to their usual subservient attitude on the issue of revising the Security Treaty. They should protect the democratic forces from being destroyed by Kishi's tyrannical behavior. In the face of a serious situation, they should first respect the collective will of the sovereign people – the attitude expected of responsible politicians. Acting immediately in accordance with public opinion demanding Kishi's resignation and the immediate dissolution of the Diet will be the touchstone of a politician's conscience.
    The voice of the vast majority of the people demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet is becoming clearer day by day.
    Our party, along with the people of the entire country, will exert all its strength to achieve this goal through the nationwide strike on June 4th, the campaign to collect signatures from more than half of the voters, and the waves of rallies and demonstrations protesting to the US and Japanese governments.

### 日共中央发表声明要求解散国会和岸内阁辞职  主张民主选举组成临时政府

    日共中央发表声明要求解散国会和岸内阁辞职
    主张民主选举组成临时政府
    本报讯　日本共产党中央委员会干部会5月31日发表了一项声明——“要求解散国会，由不包括岸集团在内的整个国会力量组成的选举监督内阁实行选举”。声明全文如下：
    岸首相并没有就横暴行为进行任何的反省，他在记者招待会上和电视节目中说：“如果自己辞职的话，情况会变成怎样呢？”他正在拼命企图加强威胁的态度。但是，我们要再次强调：岸必须放弃这种极端傲慢的态度，立刻引咎辞职。假如岸辞职，就必需由不包括曾经采取横暴行为的岸集团在内的整个国会力量——社会党、共产党、民主社会党以及自由民主党内所有赞成岸下台、解散国会的人，以采取民主的方式进行选举为最低限度的目标，组织一个选举监督内阁，解散国会。
    在这个时候，在自由民主党内，所有对岸的横暴行为提出批评和感到不满的人，在修改安全条约问题上，不固执于这些人一向采取的追随的态度，保卫民主力量，使它免遭岸的横暴行为的摧残，在遇到严重的局面的时候，首先尊重有主权的人——国民的集体意志，这是负责的政治家所应有的态度。立即按照要求岸下台、立即解散国会的舆论行事，这将是辨别政治家的良心的试金石。
    国民绝大多数要求立刻解散国会的呼声一天比一天清楚了。
    我们党将通过6月4日的全国罢工、征求一半以上选民签名的行动、一浪接一浪地向美日政府表示抗议的集会和示威游行的巨浪，同全国人民一道，为达到目的而竭尽自己的一切力量。
