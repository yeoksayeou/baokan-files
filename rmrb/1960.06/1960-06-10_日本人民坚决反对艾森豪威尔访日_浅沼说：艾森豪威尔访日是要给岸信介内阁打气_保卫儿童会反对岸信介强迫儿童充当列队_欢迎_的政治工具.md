Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch: The White House's announcement that Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan remains unchanged has aroused further anger and protests from the Japanese people.

Ichio Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, pointed out on the 8th that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is to encourage the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. He reiterated that the Socialist Party firmly opposes the US President's visit. He stressed that the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet should be realized first. He also condemned US Secretary of State Herter's interpretation that the scope of the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" includes China and the Soviet Union. He said that this further exposed the dangerous nature of the new Japan-US "Security Treaty."

Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said on the 8th that the White House's statement was to rescue the tottering Kishi Cabinet. He said that Sohyo will further continue the movement against the US President's visit in accordance with the will of the people.

The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs decided on June 11th to send a delegation of six atomic bomb victims from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Tokyo International Airport to meet with US President's Press Secretary Hagerty to express their opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Fifty-eight professors from Tokyo University of Education issued a statement on the 8th opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan under the current circumstances, demanding that the forced vote on the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives be declared invalid.

Masashige Matsushita, President of Rikkyo University, sent a letter to the US Ambassador in Tokyo expressing his opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The Japan Association to Protect Children submitted a petition to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education on the 8th, requesting it not to force elementary school students to line up on the streets to "welcome" Eisenhower. The petition said that the Kishi Nobusuke government should not use elementary school students as their political tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th dispatch: Regardless of the Japanese people's angry protests, the US government insists that Eisenhower visit Japan as scheduled in order to support the tottering Kishi Nobusuke regime.

The White House issued a statement on the 7th, announcing that "no consideration is being given to changing the President's (Eisenhower) trip to Japan."

New York State Governor and big capitalist Rockefeller, while advocating that Eisenhower visit Japan as planned, was also sweating over the President's treatment during his visit to Japan. After holding a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with Eisenhower at the White House yesterday, he said that he "admired" Eisenhower's decision to visit Japan as planned. However, he said that during the meeting he had emphasized to Eisenhower the unease Americans felt about his visit to Japan. Rockefeller also admitted that Eisenhower would face risks in Japan, but he encouraged Eisenhower, saying that the President "never retreats in the face of danger."

Senator Fulbright, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, reiterated his concern yesterday about Eisenhower's visit to Japan, saying that Herter's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee still had not fully resolved his concern about whether it was appropriate to conduct the visit now. Fulbright said, "I still hope he doesn't go unless he gets considerable assurances that he won't be subjected to the kind of unseemly behavior" that Vice President Nixon encountered during his visit to Venezuela.

    浅沼说：艾森豪威尔访日是要给岸信介内阁打气
    保卫儿童会反对岸信介强迫儿童充当列队“欢迎”的政治工具
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：白宫宣布艾森豪威尔访日计划不变，激起了日本人民进一步的愤怒和抗议。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎8日指出，艾森豪威尔访日是给岸信介内阁打气。他再次表示，社会党坚决反对美国总统的访问。他强调应当首先实现岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。他还谴责美国国务卿赫脱关于新日美“安全条约”适用的“远东”范围包括中国和苏联的解释。他说，这进一步暴露了新日美“安全条约”的危险性质。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏8日说，白宫的声明是为了援救摇摇欲坠的岸内阁的。他说，“总评”将进一步按照国民的意志，继续进行反对美国总统访日的运动。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会决定在6月11日派遣由六名广岛和长崎的原子弹受害者组成的代表团，到东京国际机场去见美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂，表示反对艾森豪威尔访日。
    东京教育大学的五十八位教授在8日发表声明，反对艾森豪威尔在目前形势下访日，要求宣布众议院对新日美“安全条约”的强行表决无效。
    立教大学校长松下正寿送了一封信给驻东京的美国大使，表示反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    日本保卫儿童会8日向东京都教育当局提出一封请愿书，要求它不要强迫小学生到街上列队“欢迎”艾森豪威尔。请愿书说，岸信介政府不应该把小学生当作他们的政治工具使用。
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾日本人民的愤怒抗议，美国政府坚持艾森豪威尔如期访问日本，以便给摇摇欲坠的岸信介政权撑腰。
    白宫在7日发表声明，宣布“没有考虑改变总统（艾森豪威尔）去日本的访问”。
    纽约州州长、大资本家洛克菲勒在鼓吹艾森豪威尔按原计划访问日本的同时，也对总统访问日本时的遭遇捏着一把冷汗。他昨天在白宫同艾森豪威尔举行了一个半小时的会谈后说，他“佩服”艾森豪威尔按原计划访问日本的决定。但是，他说，他在会谈中曾向艾森豪威尔强调美国人看到他访问日本而表示的不安。洛克菲勒也承认艾森豪威尔在日本将遇到风险，但他给艾森豪威尔打气说，总统“从不在危险前面后退”。
    参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人富布赖特昨天再次对艾森豪威尔现在去日本访问表示担心，他说，赫脱在参议院外委会的作证仍然没有完全解决他对于现在进行访问是否适宜的担心。富布赖特说，“我仍然希望他不要去，除非他得到相当的保证，说他不会遭受到副总统尼克松访问委内瑞拉时”所遇到的“那种不成体统的行为。”
