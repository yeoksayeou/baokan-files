Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: The Nobusuke Kishi traitorous group, disregarding the protests of people from all walks of life in Japan, brazenly declared today that it would suppress workers participating in the general strike and conducting patriotic anti-American struggle.

	Labor Minister Matsuno Raizo of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet slandered the workers' just struggle as a "very bad power struggle" at a press conference today, and nonsensically claimed that workers exercising their right to strike was "violating democratic principles."

	He threatened that the Kishi Nobusuke government is "considering swift action so that the same strike will not occur in the future."

	He also announced that the Kishi Nobusuke government will hold a meeting of cabinet members responsible for "public safety" on the 6th to "study countermeasures."

	At the same time, Nobusuke Kishi's confidant, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Masajiro Kawashima, also clamored when talking about today's general strike this morning, "We must severely punish those responsible."

	He had to admit that this strike was "orderly," but he unreasonably said, "Absolutely should not allow" such political strikes to be held.

    岸信介集团悍然宣布要镇压参加罢工工人
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介卖国集团不顾日本各界人民的抗议，今天公然表示要镇压参加总罢工、进行反美爱国斗争的工人。
    岸信介内阁的劳动相松野赖三今天在记者招待会上诬蔑工人的正义斗争是“非常坏的实力斗争”，并胡说工人行使罢工权利是“违反民主的法则”。
    他扬言岸信介政府“正在考虑迅速进行处分，以便今后不再发生同样的罢工”。
    他还宣布，岸信介政府将在6日举行负责“治安”问题的阁员会议，“研究对策”。
    同时，岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎今天上午就今天的总罢工发表谈话时，也叫嚷“一定要严重地惩办负责人”。
    他不得不承认：这一次的罢工“秩序井然”，但是，他又无理地说：“绝对不应当允许举行”这样的政治性罢工。
