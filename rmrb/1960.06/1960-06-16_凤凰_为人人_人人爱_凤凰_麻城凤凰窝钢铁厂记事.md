　　“Phoenix” for Everyone, Everyone Loves “Phoenix”
　　——Notes on the Macheng Fenghuangwo Steel Plant
　　By our reporters Feng Jian and Xu Ben

The people of Macheng County, Hubei Province, call the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant their "lifeline." They proudly composed a song praising their steel plant: A phoenix comes from a chicken coop, steel grows wings. There are many varieties of products, wire rods are long and long; whatever you want, you can get it, economical and convenient. "Phoenix" is for everyone, everyone loves "Phoenix."

Any visitor from other places feels that their horizons have been broadened by what they see and hear here, and they are as happy as the people of Macheng.

In this county at the southern foot of the Dabie Mountains, people see:

In the golden wheat fields of ten thousand acres, there is steel produced by "Phoenix" on the slowly moving harvesters.

On the construction sites of reservoir dams that cut off hundreds of rivers, large and small, the rubber-wheeled carts made of Fenghuangwo steel are speeding lightly.

The sawtooth-shaped factory buildings of the new spinning mill use Fenghuangwo steel as their framework.

In the factories of the People's Communes, small motors are singing happily. It is made of silicon steel sheets produced by Fenghuangwo.

In the farm tool factory, Fenghuangwo's welding rods are flashing blue sparks.

The stream gurgles, and the water mill turns day and night. Its steel shaft is also produced by Fenghuangwo.

Also, the wire nails on the wooden ferry boats, the window latches and door locks of the newly built health centers in the communes, the barber's razors, the girls' hairpins, the mosquito net hooks of thousands of households... Almost everywhere, you can see traces of steel products from the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant.

　　Taking Root and Blossoming in Agriculture

It has only been a little over a year since the people of Macheng ended their history of lacking iron and steel. How urgently does the great leap forward in rural areas and agricultural production need steel! The production of the Macheng Fenghuangwo Steel Plant serves agricultural production everywhere. It has already taken root and blossomed in agriculture.

In the spring of 1958, the spring of the first Great Leap Forward era, in order to realize the great leap forward in agricultural production, Macheng County sent hundreds of cadres all over the major cities of the country to purchase steel. However, there were too many places in the country that needed steel, and the steel allocated to them by the state could only meet one-third of their needs. Macheng is a well-known cotton-producing county in Hubei Province. In that year, the county's 130,000 mu of cotton fields needed to fully promote the experience of using "nutrient pots" to grow cotton seedlings for high yields. However, without thin steel plates and round steel, how could "pot-making machines" be manufactured? People were mobilized. They collected scrap gasoline drums, took out their flashlights, pried them open... In the end, they still didn't make enough "pot-making machines."

Also in the spring of this year, the Macheng County Party Committee planned to add 10,000 new-style plows to welcome spring plowing. The employees of the County Machinery Factory enthusiastically accepted the task of manufacturing plows. They even rushed to make the plow frames for 10,000 plows as early as the winter of 1957. However, the manufacturing work was forced to stop because there was no gray cast iron to cast plowshares; 10,000 plows needed tens of thousands of screws, and there were none. The spring plowing season was approaching. The factory quickly sent Deputy Director Dong Guobao to Wuhan, more than 200 miles away, to find a solution. Dong Guobao ran around Wuhan and spent more than half a month, but the pig iron and screws he obtained were only enough to assemble 7,500 plows.

The birth, growth, and expansion of the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant have shown a new picture for the mechanization and semi-mechanization of Macheng's rural areas. In April 1959, the cotton planting season arrived. The high-yield plan of cultivating cotton seedlings with "nutrient pots" once again reached out for steel. However, at this time, there was the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant, and a small rolling mill could produce steel. The rolling workers worked hard for five days and five nights in a row, rolling out a batch of thin steel plates and round steel, making more than 8,000 "pot-making machines," and completing the cotton planting task ahead of schedule.

At the end of May, it was the busy season for harvesting wheat and transplanting rice in Macheng's rural areas. The golden wheat waves rolled at the foot of the Dabie Mountains, and a bumper harvest was in sight. Larks chased the wheat waves and chirped happily, and cuckoos urged people to transplant rice from morning till night. However, before this busy season arrived, Macheng's farm tool machinery factory had already used steel from the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant to prepare more than 600 harvesters, rice transplanters, threshers, and more than 700,000 summer harvesting tools and small farming tools for the countryside, ready for battle.

Zhao Jinliang, the First Secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee, said to those who came to Macheng to visit: "Because we can produce steel ourselves, we produce it whenever we want it, and we produce whatever we want. We no longer have to look up to others and only reach out for it." This is the heartfelt praise of 700,000 Macheng people for Fenghuangwo's steel "small foreign group."

　　In the Struggle to Harness Water

The Ju River flows out of the Dabie Mountain valley with twists and turns, and is cut off by a dam more than 20 meters high, forming a clear green artificial lake.

This is the Fulianghe Reservoir construction site.

The heroic people of Macheng, in order to overcome drought and achieve water conservancy at high speed, mobilized more than 100,000 people last winter and this spring to build more than 600 large and small reservoirs, with a storage capacity more than twice the total storage capacity of the county in 1958. The dam of the Fulianghe Reservoir, with more than 600,000 cubic meters of earth, was completed by more than 20,000 people in only 90 days.

In this water management struggle that raced against time, people will remember the achievements of the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant.

When the construction sites of the reservoirs were vigorously promoting vehicle transportation to improve the efficiency of earthwork, the workers of the steel plant produced a large number of steel wires, ball bearings, steel rings, and car levers in half a month, and assembled tens of thousands of rubber-wheeled carts and tens of thousands of pickaxes, steel drills, and pound hammers, arming the water conservancy construction army. We saw at the Fulianghe Reservoir construction site that these rubber-wheeled carts, shuttling back and forth, pulled hundreds of kilograms per cart, as light and fast as flying. In the quarry, the rock drillers split open half of the mountain. In the sound of pickaxes and steel drills, rock powder splashed and sparks flew. At the hydropower station construction site, the steel workers were processing the thin steel bars from Fenghuangwo. They smiled and said to the visitors that this hydropower station would illuminate the mountain villages here on "July 1st."

In the Chengguan People's Commune, the members talked about such a story: Last November, it was raining and snowing. The three small reservoirs of Maojiachong, Qilinshan, and Huxingdi, which were being built simultaneously by the commune, were under construction in a tense manner. At that time, the weather was cold and the roads were slippery, and the efficiency of manual labor was very low. A technician calculated that it would take more than 110 days just to move the hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of earth at the Maojiachong Reservoir, and it would be difficult to complete it by New Year's Day in 1960. Some people at the Qilinshan Reservoir construction site also muttered: "I'm afraid we won't be able to complete the entire project this year, let's leave half of it to do next year."

It was at this time that the leaders of the County Party Committee launched a tool reform movement at the various reservoir construction sites, and the steel plates, iron wires, and round steel from the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant were transported to the commune. How excited the members were. At the Maojiachong Reservoir construction site, they launched a surprise attack and manufactured five pulleys and more than 200 rubber-wheeled carts in a few days. As a result, rail transport and cart transport replaced manual labor, and the excavation and transportation indicators rose like arrows.

The completion and release of water from the Maojiachong, Qilinshan, and Huxingdi reservoirs enabled more than 90% of the paddy fields in the Chengguan People's Commune to be irrigated by gravity flow. When the clear water flowed continuously along the newly opened small canals into a green early rice field, the members often thought of their beloved steel plant and the song "Phoenix' for everyone, everyone loves 'Phoenix'."

　　The "Backer" of County and Commune Industries

In Macheng, people can always perceive that Fenghuangwo's steel is permeating the entire body of county and commune industries. It nourishes the rapid growth of county and commune industries, like the new bamboo shoots emerging from the ground after the spring rain in the bamboo forests of the Dabie Mountains.

In the winter of 1958, the flames of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking illuminated the peaks of the Dabie Mountains. At that time, Macheng County had only ten or so small factories. Today, all twelve communes in the county have nearly 200 small factories. These small factories include: farm tool machinery factories, power stations, nitrogen fertilizer plants, brick and tile factories, timber factories, spinning mills, paper mills, rice and flour processing plants... Many silent villages resounded with the roar of motors.

The fastest development has been in the farm tool machinery factories. Steel and silicon steel sheets from the Fenghuangwo Steel Plant were made into 77 machine tools, 60 electric motors, and a large number of small mechanical tools, equipping the commune's farm tool machinery factories. Now, there are two farm tool machinery factories in the county seat, 18 farm tool machinery factories in the communes, and 68 farm tool machinery factories in the management areas. In addition, there are repair and assembly groups in the production teams. A farm tool machinery repair and manufacturing network has been formed throughout the county. These factories have repaired and manufactured more than 1.2 million large and small farm tools in the past year.

Like the farm tool machinery factory of the "Zhongyi" Commune, the members built it in only two months. Outside the gate of this factory are lush green rice fields. Production began this "May 1st," and in less than a month, it sent the first batch of feed grinders, noodle rolling machines, and sharp sand sickles to the surrounding rural areas.

    “凤凰”为人人  人人爱“凤凰”
    ——麻城凤凰窝钢铁厂记事
    本报记者　冯健　徐奔
    湖北麻城县人民，把凤凰窝钢铁厂称作自己的“命根子”。他们自豪地编了一支歌颂扬自己的钢铁厂：鸡窝出凤凰，钢铁长翅膀。产品花样多，线材长又长；要啥就有啥，经济又便当。“凤凰”为人人，人人爱“凤凰”。
    任何一个外地来客，对这里的所见所闻，都深感广开眼界，都像麻城人一样满心喜悦。
    在这个大别山南麓的县里，人们看到：
    万顷金色的麦田里，徐徐行进的收割机上，有“凤凰”生产的钢材。
    拦腰截断了几百条大小河流的水库大坝工地上，用凤凰窝钢材制成的胶轮板车，轻快地飞奔着。
    新建纺纱厂锯齿形的厂房，是用凤凰窝的钢材作筋骨。
    人民公社的工厂里，小马达在快乐地唱歌。它是用凤凰窝生产的矽钢片制成的。
    农具厂里，凤凰窝的电焊条，闪烁着青色的火花。
    溪流上水声淙淙，水磨在日夜不停地转动。它的钢轴也是凤凰窝生产的。
    还有，那木渡船上的洋钉，公社新建卫生院的门窗插销、门锁，理发员的剃刀，姑娘们的发卡，千家万户的蚊帐帐钩……几乎处处能看到凤凰窝钢铁厂钢铁制品的踪迹。
    在农业上扎根开花
    麻城人民结束了自己少铁无钢的历史，只不过是一年多以来的事。大跃进的农村，大跃进的农业生产，多么迫切地需要钢呵！麻城凤凰窝钢铁厂的生产，就是处处为农业生产服务。它已经在农业上扎根开花。
    1958年的春天，第一个大跃进年代的春天，麻城县为了实现农业生产大跃进，全县曾经派出上百名干部，走遍全国各大城市采购钢铁。但是，全国需要钢材的地方实在太多了，国家调给他们的钢材，只能满足他们需要的三分之一。麻城是湖北省有名的棉花丰产县，就在这一年，全县十三万亩棉田要全面推广用“营养钵”育苗的棉花丰产经验。但是，没有薄钢板和元钢，怎么制造“制钵器”呢？人们动员起来了。他们搜集废旧汽油桶，拿出自己的手电筒，撬开它，……最后还是没有造出足够的“制钵器”来。
    也就是这一年的春天，麻城县委计划添置一万部新式步犁，迎接春耕。县机械厂的职工精神奋发地接受了步犁制造任务，他们甚至提早在1957年的冬天，就把一万部步犁的犁架赶制出来了。但是，制造工作被迫停顿了下来，——没有灰口铁铸犁头；一万部犁需要几万颗螺丝，也没有。眼看着春耕季节迫近了。厂里连忙派副厂长董国保匆匆赶赴二百多里路以外的武汉去想办法。董国保在武汉到处奔走，费了半个多月工夫，弄到手的生铁、螺丝，却只够装七千五百部犁。
    凤凰窝钢铁厂的诞生和成长、壮大，给麻城农村的机械化、半机械化，展示出一幅新的图景。1959年4月，棉花播种季节到了。用“营养钵”培育棉苗的丰产计划，又向人们伸手要钢。然而这时候，有了凤凰窝钢铁厂，有小轧钢机可以出钢材了。轧钢工人们一连苦干了五天五夜，轧出一批薄钢板和元钢，造了八千多个“制钵器”，抢在季节前面完成了棉花播种任务。
    5月末，正是麻城农村割麦、插秧两头忙的季节。大别山麓金黄的麦浪滚滚，丰收在望。云雀追逐着麦浪欢叫嬉戏，布谷鸟晨昏催人插秧。然而，早在这大忙季节到来之前，麻城的农具机械厂，已经用凤凰窝钢铁厂的钢材，为农村准备好了六百多部收割机、插秧机、脱粒机，七十多万件夏收工具和小型耕作工具严阵以待了。
    麻城县委第一书记赵金良，对来麻城参观的人说过：“因为我们自己能够生产钢材，什么时候要，就什么时候生产，要什么就生产什么。我们再也不用两眼朝上，只会伸手要了。”这就是七十万麻城人对凤凰窝的这个钢铁“小洋群”衷心的赞誉。
    在治水的斗争中
    举水河从大别山谷曲曲折折地流出来，被二十多米高的拦河坝拦腰斩断，汇成了一片碧绿碧绿的人工湖。
    这是浮桥河水库工地。
    英雄的麻城人民，为了战胜干旱，高速度实现水利化，去冬今春出动了十几万人，修建了六百多座大大小小的水库，蓄水量比1958年全县总蓄水量还多两倍。浮桥河水库的这座拦河坝，六十多万方土，两万多人只花九十天时间就完成了。
    在这场和时间赛跑的治水斗争中，人们将记住凤凰窝钢铁厂的功迹。
    当水库工地上大搞车子化提高土方工作效率的时候，钢铁厂的工人们在半个月内生产了大批钢丝、滚珠、钢圈、车杠，装配了一万数千部胶轮板车和数以万计的洋镐、钢钎、磅锤，武装了水利建设大军。我们在浮桥河水库工地看到，这些穿行如梭的胶轮板车，一车拉好几百斤，轻快如飞。采石场上，凿岩工人们劈开了半壁山。在洋镐、钢钎凿岩声中，岩粉飞溅，火星迸发。水电站工地上，钢筋工正在加工凤凰窝的细钢筋。他们笑对来客说，这个水电站，“七一”就要照亮这里的山村了。
    在城关人民公社，社员们谈到这样一个故事：去年11月，雨雪霏霏。公社同时修建的毛家冲、麒麟山、虎形地三座小水库，正在紧张地施工。那时候，天冷路滑，人工效率很低。有一个技术员计算了一下，仅是毛家冲水库的十几万方土，就得一百一十多天，到1960年元旦也很难完成。麒麟山水库工地也有人嘀咕：“今年怕完不成全部工程了，留一半明年再做吧。”
    正是这个时候，县委领导各水库工地展开了工具改革运动，凤凰窝钢铁厂的钢板、铁丝、元钢运到公社来了。社员们多么兴高采烈呵。他们在毛家冲水库工地，连日突击制造了五部滑车和二百多部胶轮板车。于是，铁木轨道运输和车子运输，代替了人工，挖运指标箭也似的上升了。
    毛家冲、麒麟山和虎形地三个水库竣工放水，使城关人民公社90％几的水田，能够自流灌溉了。当清澈的流水沿着新开的小渠，哗哗不停地灌进一片青葱的早稻田时，社员们往往会想起他们心爱的钢铁厂，想起“‘凤凰’为人人，人人爱‘凤凰’”那句歌谣。
    县、社工业的“靠山”
    在麻城，人们随时能觉察到，凤凰窝的钢铁，渗透在县、社工业的整个肌体里。它滋润着县、社工业迅速成长，像大别山区竹林里，春雨后破土而出的新笋一般。
    1958年冬天，大炼钢铁的火光映红了大别山的峰峦。那时候，麻城县只有十来个小工厂。今天，全县十二个公社已经有了近二百个小工厂。这些小工厂有：农具机械厂，电站、氮肥厂，砖瓦厂，木材厂，纺纱厂，造纸厂，米面加工厂……许多寂静的乡村，响起了马达的轰鸣。
    发展最快的要算农具机械厂了。凤凰窝钢铁厂的钢铁、矽钢片，被制成七十七台机床，六十台电动机和大批小型机械工具，装备了公社的农具机械厂。现在，县城有两个农具机械厂，公社有十八个农具机械厂，管理区有六十八个农具机械厂，再加上生产队的修配组，全县范围内已经形成了一个农具机械修造网。这些工厂一年来总共修造了一百二十多万件大小农具。
    像“中一”公社的农具机械工厂，社员们只用两个来月就盖起来了。这个工厂门外就是翠绿的稻田，今年“五一”开始生产，不到一个月，就把头一批饲料粉碎机、轧面机和锋利的沙镰送给了周围农村。
