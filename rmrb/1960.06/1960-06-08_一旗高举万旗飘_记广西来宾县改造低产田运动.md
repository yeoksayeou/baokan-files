    One Flag Raised, Ten Thousand Flags Fluttering
    ——A Record of the Low-Yield Farmland Transformation Movement in Laibin County

    "Dangerous" Dong

In the Pingxi Brigade of Laibin Commune, there was a piece of farmland where the rice seedlings always grew thin, weak, and yellow, and the seedlings did not tiller well. If you asked whether it could yield grain, people would always shake their heads and say, "Dangerous! Dangerous!" Therefore, this piece of farmland was named "Dangerous" Dong. In the past, people would detour around it, not wanting to look at it. But since the wooden sign of "Three-Level Secretaries' Experimental Plot" was planted this spring, this Dong has become like a first-class rice seedling exhibition, with groups of visitors coming and going.

Low-yield farmlands like "Dangerous" Dong were numerous in Laibin County. In previous years, because its yield could not be increased, the county's average yield was dragged down by it. This year, in order to realize the plan of "surpassing the annual output target in half a year," Laibin County must vigorously transform these low-yield farmlands.

During the spring plowing preparation stage, Zhang Wenqing, the former First Secretary of the County Party Committee, found during a production inspection that the signs of the cadres' experimental plots were all planted in good farmlands. This past normal phenomenon aroused a new idea: if the cadres' experimental plots were all moved to low-yield farmlands, it could strengthen the cadres' sense of responsibility for transforming low-yield farmlands, thereby summarizing the experience of transforming low-yield farmlands. Wouldn't this be a huge boost to transforming the low-yield farmlands, which account for more than a quarter of the county? After research, the County Party Committee made such a decision and discussed and deployed it at the commune Party committee secretaries' meeting.

"Three-Level Secretaries' Experimental Plot"

Just as Huang Detang, the First Secretary of Laibin Commune, was running around selecting the location for the experimental plot, Comrade Li Guangxian, the Secretary of the County Party Committee in charge of agriculture, came. He said to Huang Detang: The County Party Committee wants to make your place a key point for transforming low-yield farmlands. As he spoke, the two of them immediately turned around and walked out the door, arriving at "Dangerous" Dong. Huang Detang told Li Guangxian that this Dong was low-yielding because it was red soil, shallow-bottomed, and lacked organic matter; the seedlings did not tiller well after being planted, and the yield had always been very low, only one or two hundred catties per mu, or even dozens of catties. Li Guangxian believed that this kind of farmland was representative of Laibin County. He was not afraid of it being bad; as long as they could deal with it, they could find the experience of managing low-yield farmlands. So, it was decided to establish the experimental plot here, and he suggested that the Commune Party Committee and the County Party Committee work together on this experimental plot. After the news spread, the Party Branch Secretary of the Pingxi Brigade also asked to participate. The sign of "Three-Level Secretaries' Experimental Plot" was planted in "Dangerous" Dong.

The Banner of Transforming Low-Yield Farmlands

One evening, Zhang Jingfeng, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, came to "Dangerous" Dong. The Commune Party Committee Secretary and the Brigade Party Branch Secretary gathered together, and the three-level secretaries met at the edge of the field. Technicians and the young men of the youth commando team responsible for managing this Dong also rushed over, and the quiet field suddenly became lively.

They observed and diagnosed "Dangerous" Dong. The mud in this field did not stick to their feet when they stepped on it, and the water did not bubble. The rice seedlings had been planted for more than ten days, but they were still sparsely scattered and yellow and weak. Some people wavered and said, "Dangerous" Dong is still dangerous. After hearing this, Zhang Jingfeng continued: Transforming low-yield farmlands requires investing some capital. Attempting to get more grain without any effort is a lazy man's fantasy. This old hand at agricultural production, who came from a long-term laboring background, carefully observed and said with certainty: "We must work hard and cleverly. I think applying lime will help." The technician agreed with Zhang Jingfeng's opinion, interjecting: This kind of farmland contains a lot of acidity and does need to be limed. The Commune Party Committee Secretary and the Brigade Party Branch Secretary also agreed, believing that the recent cold weather was also a reason why the rice seedlings were not easily turning green, and applying lime could increase the soil temperature. With more people, there were more ideas, and everyone found an emergency remedy. After the lime was spread, the whole field was white, and even pests were killed. Sure enough, after a few days, the rice seedlings all turned green. The secretaries conducted another consultation and believed that it was necessary to immediately engage in large-scale green manure pressing and attack human and animal manure. This could further improve the soil, increase organic matter, and promote seedling growth. Three days later, this field turned into black slurry. After repeated consultations and emergency treatments, the rice seedlings greatly improved. Now, within a radius of 300 mu of "Dangerous" Dong, the rice seedlings tiller into fifteen or sixteen shoots per plant, growing vigorously and evenly, and are more than two feet tall. It has caught up with the rice seedlings in the opposite "Ace" Dong. People praised this piece of rice seedlings as: The wind blows the rice seedlings into waves, better than a green sea reflecting the blue sky.

After this red flag of transforming low-yield farmlands was raised in the whole county, the County Party Committee held two on-site meetings here, and Laibin Commune held five on-site meetings here. A situation of "one flag raised, ten thousand flags fluttering" appeared in the whole county. Now, most of the experimental fields and high-yield fields, accounting for 20% of the county's total cultivated land area, are established in low-yield farmlands. More than 3,000 cadres and 80,000 commune members have participated in the struggle to transform low-yield farmlands, determined to change the long-standing low-yield face of Laibin County.

    一旗高举万旗飘
    ——记广西来宾县改造低产田运动

    “危险”垌
    来宾公社平西大队有一块田，禾苗长的老是瘦细发黄，秧苗不发蔸。如果你问起能不能收谷子，人们总是摇头说：“危险！危险！”因此，这块田便得名叫“危险”垌。过去人们走到这里，都是绕道而过，不想看它。可是自从今春插下了“三级书记试验田”的木牌子，这个垌就像开了个一类禾苗展览，参观的人去了一帮，又来一帮。
    像“危险”垌这类低产田，在来宾县为数不少。往年由于它的产量跃不上去，全县的平均产量就给它拉低了。今年来宾县为了实现“全年包产半年超”的计划，就必须大力改造这些低产田。
    在今春备耕阶段，前任县委第一书记张文卿在检查生产中，发现干部试验田的牌子都插在好田里。这个过去的平常现象，却引起了一个新的想法：如果把干部试验田都搬到低产田去，可以加强干部对改造低产田的责任心，从而总结出改造低产田的经验，这对改造约占全县四分之一以上的低产田岂不是一个巨大的推动吗？县委经过研究后作出了这样的决定，并且在公社党委书记会议上讨论和布置了。
    “三级书记试验田”
    正当来宾公社第一书记黄德棠到处奔跑，选择试验田地点的时候，县委管农业的书记李光显同志来了。他对黄德棠说：县委想在你们这里搞个改造低产田的重点。说着，两个人马上转身走出门，来到“危险”垌。黄德棠告诉李光显，这个垌由于是红壤土，浅底田，缺乏有机质，插下苗不发蔸，产量一向很低，亩产只有一、二百斤，甚而几十斤。李光显认为这种田在来宾县有代表性，不怕它坏，只要对付得了它，就能找出治理低产田的经验。于是决定把试验田建立在这里，他并建议公社党委和县委一起来搞这片试验田。消息传出去以后，平西大队的党支部书记也要求参加。“三级书记试验田”的牌子，便插在“危险”垌里了。
    改造低产田的旗帜
    一天傍晚，县委第一书记张景凤同志来到“危险”垌。公社党委书记、大队党支部书记都聚拢来，三级书记便会师田头。技术员和负责管理这个垌的青年突击队的小伙子们也赶来了，宁静的田野顿时活跃起来。
    他们在“危险”垌里察看会诊。这块田踩下去泥不沾脚，水不起泡；禾苗插下去十几天了，还是稀稀落落的一片黄弱。有几个人动摇地说：“危险”垌还是危险哪，张景凤听了这话接着便说：改造低产田就得下点本钱，企图不费吹灰之力而取得更多的粮食，那是懒汉幻想。他这个打长工出身，农业生产的老内行，仔细地察看以后，有把握地说：“我们要苦干加巧干。我看，下石灰有作用。”技术员赞同张景凤的意见，插嘴说：这种田含酸性多，确需放石灰。公社党委书记和大队党支部书记也表示同意，他们认为最近天气冷，也是禾苗不容易转青的一个原因，施放石灰可以提高土温。人多智广，大家找出了急救的办法。一遍石灰撒下去，满田是白，连虫害都杀死了，几天之后，禾苗果然全部转青。书记们又进行了一次会诊，认为必须立即大搞绿肥压青，并攻人畜粪。这样可以进一步改良土壤，增加有机质，催苗生长。三天之后，这片田变成了浑黑的泥浆。经过三番五次的会诊和急救，禾苗大改观，现在“危险”垌方圆之内三百亩田，禾苗蔸蔸分蘖十五、六苗，生长茁壮平整，有二尺多高了。它已经赶上了对面“王牌”垌的禾苗，人们盛赞这片禾苗是：风吹禾苗起波浪，胜似绿海映蓝天。
    这面改造低产田的红旗在全县竖起以后，县委在这里举行过两次现场会议，来宾公社在这里召开过五次现场会议，全县出现了一旗高举万旗飘的形势。现在，占全县耕地总面积20％的试验田、丰产田，大多数是建立在低产田里。有三千多干部、八万多社员参加了改造低产田的斗争，决心改变来宾县历来低产的面貌。
