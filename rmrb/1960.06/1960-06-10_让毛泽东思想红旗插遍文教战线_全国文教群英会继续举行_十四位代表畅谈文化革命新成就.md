As of today, all speeches at the conference have been completed. Since the 2nd, a total of fifty representatives have spoken at the conference.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education entered its final day of speeches today. In their speeches today, fourteen representatives unanimously stated that after this conference, they will continue to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, with the spirit of continuous revolution, push China's cultural revolution to a new and greater climax.

Persist in Carrying Out Teaching Reform Under the Leadership of the Party and Strive to Make China's Education Surpass All Capitalist Countries

Ma Jianmin, representative of Beijing Normal University, spoke first at the morning session. The title of his speech was "Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Thoroughly Carry Out Teaching Reform in Primary and Secondary Schools." He said that since February of this year, Beijing Normal University has formed a teaching reform force of more than 3,600 people, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, in accordance with the general line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and in accordance with Comrade Lu Dingyi's instructions of "appropriately shortening the duration, appropriately increasing the level, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor," and began to carry out comprehensive reform of primary and secondary school teaching. By March, a nine-year consistent teaching reform plan for full-time primary and secondary schools and teaching outlines for each subject were proposed. Subsequently, a complete set of trial textbooks was compiled according to the plan and outline, and experiments were carried out in affiliated middle and primary schools. The results proved that students can accept and teachers can be competent according to the new plan. After introducing their experience, Ma Jianmin pointed out that although the plan we proposed and the textbooks we compiled have been experimented with for three months and achieved preliminary results, many issues remain to be further discussed and studied. He stated that they will definitely hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in carrying out teaching reform under the leadership of the Party, and strive to make China's education surpass all capitalist countries.

Deqin, a Mongolian representative who used to herd sheep for the herdlords in the old society and is now a teacher at the Chaidamu National Normal School in Qinghai Province, then spoke at the meeting. He said that he had herded sheep for the herdlords since he was seven years old and spent his childhood in tears. After liberation in 1949, he was cultivated by the Party and studied at the Qinghai Nationalities Institute and the Northwest Nationalities Institute. After graduation, he became a teacher and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in 1959. The students in his class advanced from the third grade of elementary school to the first grade of junior high school in two and a half years, and the percentage of students with excellent grades increased from only 23% of all students in the second semester of 1958 to 72% in the first semester of 1959. As a result, he was rated as a first-class advanced worker at the Chaidamu region and Qinghai Province cultural and educational heroes conferences.

Ma Qianli, representative of Wuzhong Normal School of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said in his speech that their school had resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, so that all 400 students in the school not only reaped a bumper harvest in terms of ideology and study, but also mastered more than one production technology knowledge, and 90 people have become all-rounders in production labor. The students' weight has generally increased by five to eight kilograms in the past two years. Therefore, the work of this school has been well received by all parties, and it has won the title of advanced unit in Wuzhong City in education, militia training, patriotic health campaigns, and mass cultural and recreational activities.

Yang Luosheng, representative of Liuzhou People's Broadcasting Station of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said in his speech that Liuzhou Radio Station was established from scratch in January 1958 during the Great Leap Forward. As soon as it was established, it immediately devoted itself to the Party's central tasks, actively carried out propaganda and mobilization work, vigorously promoted the east wind, created enthusiasm, and boosted morale, thereby effectively promoting the victorious development of various tasks. In the mass steelmaking, technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and the anti-Rightist struggle, the radio station played a great role in encouragement and combat. The radio station also vigorously implemented the policy of running broadcasting by the whole party, organized a mass news reporting team, and the number of contributions from the masses greatly increased. This radio station has been successively rated as an advanced unit in socialist construction in Liuzhou City in 1959 and a red flag unit at the cultural and educational heroes conference of the autonomous region, and 45% of its employees have been rated as advanced workers or activists at the city level.

The Combination of Education and Productive Labor Greatly Improved the Political and Ideological Consciousness and Scientific Level of Teachers and Students at Tsinghua University

Gao Yi, representative of Tsinghua University, explained the great victory of Mao Zedong's educational thought based on the situation of Tsinghua University's unwavering implementation of the Party's education policy in the past two years. The combination of education and productive labor has greatly improved the political and ideological consciousness and scientific level of the teachers and students of Tsinghua University. At present, the vast majority of majors in the school have been tested by actual production and scientific research, and have reached advanced domestic and foreign levels in several important scientific and technological fields. Relying on the extensive cooperation of factories, schools, research institutes, and people's communes all over the country, the school has begun to establish a base combining teaching, production, and scientific research, creating favorable conditions for better completion of teaching, scientific research, and production tasks.

Gao Yi said that our future task is to continue to vigorously implement the Party's education policy, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to build a communist Tsinghua University.

"Long live the three great things, production leaps forward to produce more grain; increased production requires a good body, regular exercise strengthens physique; national defense sports are widely carried out, and flowers bloom all over Shouzhang." Tian Jianmin, representative of the National Defense Sports Committee of Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, quoted these praises from the people of Shouzhang County for carrying out national defense sports activities in his speech today. Tian Jianmin said that Shouzhang County originally had a good foundation for sports activities. After responding to Chairman Mao's call to run militia divisions in a big way, in order to enable the people to learn more modern military science knowledge and to cultivate technical talents for the realization of agricultural mechanization, the Shouzhang County Party Committee strengthened its leadership over national defense sports work. Since 1958, many national defense sports clubs have been established throughout the county, and various activities such as shooting, radio, motorcycles, parachuting, and air defense have been widely carried out. Because they paid attention to making sports activities serve production and national defense construction, they not only enhanced the people's physique, greatly reduced the incidence of diseases, and greatly improved attendance rates, but also brought hand flag communications, light communications, radio, earth broadcasting, motorcycles, etc. to the fields to direct production in this year's anti-drought struggle, playing a significant role. Because national defense sports activities are closely combined with militia training, they have also cultivated reserve soldiers for national defense construction.

After Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School ran factories on a large scale and carried out technical revolution and scientific research, the students' knowledge became richer and their thinking also made significant progress.

Wu Zimu, representative of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, used the school's practice over the past two years to prove that political command, improving teaching quality, and doing a good job in labor production are important keys to consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. He said that the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools is a major victory in overcoming bourgeois educational thought. Wu Zimu introduced the school's hard work in improving teaching quality and production self-sufficiency, overcoming various objective difficulties and ideological obstacles, and achieving major achievements. Because Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School attaches importance to sideline agriculture and industrial production, income is constantly increasing, and the scope of supply and collective welfare undertakings are expanding and improving. In terms of teaching, because it is closely integrated with production practice, coupled with the wide and comprehensive content of labor, especially because of running factories on a large scale and carrying out technical innovation and scientific research, students' knowledge fields are therefore wider, richer, and more practical, and their ideological progress is also more significant.

Sun Laikui, an actor from the Quyi Troupe of Hebei Province who has been performing Xihe Dagu for more than 20 years, talked about how he followed the Party's literary and artistic policy, went to the mountains and countryside, went deep into life, and closely cooperated with the central tasks to create. Sun Laikui said that in the future, I will guard against arrogance and impetuosity, muster greater enthusiasm, and work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and strive to make greater achievements in 1960.

The first speaker at the afternoon session was Deng Feng, representative of Pingyao County Comprehensive University, Shanxi Province. In his speech, he introduced the situation and experience of running their own university. He said that Pingyao County Comprehensive University, which was born in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, has developed into a new type of school with a "one-stop" system from kindergarten to university. At present, the university department has two two-year normal college classes and one three-year industrial college class, with a total of 62 students; together with the middle school department, elementary school department, and kindergarten, there are now a total of 2,404 students. Deng Feng said that they will cultivate more than 1,000 college students for the county in eight years.

Resolutely Implement the Party's Literary and Artistic Policy, Break Through the Old Idea That Fine Arts Films Are Difficult to Reflect Real Life, and Fully Express the Heroic Aspirations of the Chinese Working People

Hu Jinqing, representative of Shanghai Fine Arts Film Studio, said: Our factory has carried forward the pioneering spirit, broken through the old idea that it is difficult for fine arts films to reflect real life, and since the Great Leap Forward, has closely cooperated with the current political struggles, and filmed fine arts films full of the atmosphere of the great era, expressing the heroic aspirations of the Chinese working people, as well as current technical innovations and technical revolutions, such as "Singing the General Line," "Catching Up with Britain," "Celebrating a Bumper Harvest," "The Little Carp Leaps Over the Dragon Gate," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," "The Cuckoo Called Late," "The Little Agronomist," "The Little Inventor," and so on. Moreover, we have also created paper-cut films, origami films, and ink animation films, bringing extremely rich folk art and magnificent traditional art to the silver screen of fine arts films. He said that in the future, we must hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic policy, and make fine arts film art serve proletarian politics more closely.

The state-owned Tianjin Electric Appliance Factory held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carried out teaching reform in depth in the field of spare-time education for employees, and achieved remarkable results. Today, Ye Maolin, the representative of this factory, said at the conference that the in-depth development of teaching reform has powerfully promoted the great development and great improvement of employee education in this factory. At the end of 1959, the factory had established an education system consisting of 68 classes from primary school to university, with an enrollment rate of 98.2% and an attendance rate of more than 90%. In April of this year, the factory completely eliminated illiteracy. The rapid improvement of the political, cultural, and technical level of employees has become an important driving force for promoting the sustained leap forward in factory production.

Ye Maolin stated that in the future, in the spirit of continuous revolution, we will further strengthen leadership, strengthen planning, learn from the experience of fraternal units, carry out teaching reform more deeply, train construction talents more, faster, better, and more economically, and make employee education more adapted to the needs of the sustained leap forward in socialist construction.

Anhui Daily Actively Implements the Policy of Running Newspapers by the Whole Party, and More Closely Integrates with Reality and Connects with the Masses

Zhong Chong, representative of Anhui Daily, introduced the situation of Anhui Daily's implementation of the policy of running newspapers by the whole party to the conference. Zhong Chong said that running newspapers by the whole party is Chairman Mao's consistent idea of running newspapers and is the fundamental policy of party newspapers. Under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, Anhui has deeply carried out the movement of running newspapers by the whole party. The main characteristics of the movement are: the Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over newspaper work, established writing groups led by the first secretary at all levels, and implemented the methods of "walking on two legs" and "three combinations" in newspaper work. He said, "Two legs" means that the entire news team has both professional and non-professional personnel; for non-professional teams, there are writing groups directly led by the Party Committee and correspondents distributed in various fronts and corners. "Three combinations" means that the entire newspaper work combines the leadership of the Party Committee, professional journalists, and the broad masses of correspondents; the writing of an important manuscript combines leading cadres, editors, and the masses; the working method of the writing group combines study, work, and writing. Zhong Chong also described the preliminary gains since Anhui Province deeply carried out the movement of running newspapers by the whole party.

Tian Xuexi, representative of Shanglecun Elementary School of Jixian County, Henan Province, introduced the achievements and experiences of the school in carrying out reform of Chinese language teaching in his speech. He said that the articles written by the students in this school mostly have distinct ideology, smooth sentences, clear levels, and can correctly reflect real life and express their thoughts and feelings. The great leap forward in Chinese writing teaching has also driven the improvement of teaching quality in other subjects. Through participating in social political movements, productive labor, and carrying out the "reading red books" movement, students' communist consciousness has been greatly improved, their enthusiasm for labor has been unprecedentedly high, and their class viewpoints have also become clearer.

Jiang Hong, representative of the Frontline Drama Troupe of the Nanjing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, introduced the achievements of the drama troupe under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and the strong leadership of the Party, in implementing the policy of literary and artistic service to proletarian politics and to workers, peasants, and soldiers. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, this drama troupe was active in the north and south of the Yangtze River and on both sides of the Huai River, closely cooperating with combat missions, and creating and performing a large number of plays. In the ten years after the national liberation, they have adhered to the creative path of creating modern themes, reflecting revolutionary struggles, and depicting heroic figures, and have widely carried out performance activities. In 1958 alone, they performed 1,288 performances, averaging three and a half performances per day, and received thousands of letters of commendation from the troops. (Attached pictures)

    在党的领导下把教学改革坚持到底，为使我国教育事业超过一切资本主义国家而奋勇前进
    在今天上午的大会上首先发言的是北京师范大学代表马健民。他发言的题目是“高举毛泽东思想红旗，彻底进行中小学的教学改革”。他说，北京师范大学从今年2月起，组成了一支包括三千六百多名的教学改革大军，以毛泽东思想为指导，根据总路线和大跃进的精神，根据陆定一同志指示的“适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动”的原则，开始对中小学教学进行全面改革的工作。到3月份就提出了全日制中小学九年一贯制的教学改革方案和各科教学大纲，随后又根据方案和大纲编写了全套试用教材，在附中、附小进行实验，结果证明按照新的方案教学，学生可以接受，教师也可以胜任。马健民在介绍了他们的经验以后指出，我们提出的方案和编写的教材虽然进行了三个月的实验，取得了初步成绩，但是许多问题还有待进一步讨论和研究。他表示，他们一定高举毛泽东思想的红旗，在党的领导下把教学改革坚持到底，为使我国教育事业超过一切资本主义国家而奋勇前进。
    一个在旧社会给牧主放羊而现在已经当了青海省柴达木民族师范学校教师的蒙古族代表德钦接着在会上发言。他说，他从七岁起给牧主放羊，在泪水中熬过自己的童年时代。1949年解放以后，他受到党的培养，先后在青海省民族学院和西北民族学院学习，毕业后当了教师，并在1959年光荣地加入了中国共产党。他教的一班学生，在两年半的时间内，算术程度由初小三年级跃进到初中一年级的水平，成绩优良的学生由1958年下学期只占全体学生的23％上升到1959年上学期占72％。他因此在柴达木地区和青海省的文教群英会上，被评为一等先进工作者。
    宁夏回族自治区吴忠师范学校代表马千里在发言中说，他们的学校由于坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，使全校四百多名学生不仅在思想品德和学习方面获得丰收，而且每人已掌握了一项以上的生产技术知识，有九十人已成为生产劳动的多面手。学生们的体重两年来普遍增加五至八公斤。这个学校的工作因此得到各方面的好评，在教育、民兵训练、爱国卫生运动、群众文娱活动等方面都获得吴忠市先进单位的称号。
    广西僮族自治区柳州人民广播电台代表杨洛生在发言中说，柳州电台是在大跃进的1958年1月白手起家建立的，一成立就立即投入党的各项中心工作中去，积极开展宣传鼓动工作，大刮东风、大造热气、大鼓干劲，从而有力地推动了各项工作的胜利开展。在全民炼钢、技术革新和技术革命运动以及反右倾斗争中，电台都发挥了很大的鼓舞和战斗的作用。电台还大力贯彻全党办广播的方针，组织群众通讯报道队伍，群众来稿大大增加。这个电台曾先后被评为1959年柳州市的社会主义建设先进单位、自治区的文教群英会红旗单位，45％的职工评为市级先进工作者或积极分子。
    教育和生产劳动相结合，大大提高了清华大学师生的政治思想觉悟和科学水平
    清华大学代表高沂在发言中就清华大学两年来坚定不移地贯彻执行党的教育方针的情况，说明毛泽东教育思想的伟大胜利。教育和生产劳动相结合，大大提高了清华大学的师生的政治思想觉悟和科学水平。目前，学校绝大多数专业都经过了实际生产和科学研究的考验，在若干重要的科学技术领域内，已经达到了国内外先进的水平。学校依靠遍布在全国绝大多数省市的工厂、学校、研究所和人民公社的广泛协作，开始建立了教学、生产和科学研究三结合的基地，为更好地完成教学、科学研究和生产任务，创造了有利的条件。
    高沂说，我们今后的任务是继续大力贯彻执行党的教育方针，高举毛泽东思想红旗，为建设共产主义的清华大学奋勇前进。
    “三大万岁放光芒，生产跃进多打粮；增产要有好身体，经常锻炼体质强；国防体育大开展，花开香遍全寿张”。山东省寿张县国防体育委员会代表田健民在今天的发言中，引用了寿张县人民对开展国防体育运动的这几句赞语。田健民说，寿张县的体育活动原来就有较好的基础，从响应毛主席的号召大办民兵师以后，为了使人民学到更多的现代化军事科学知识，并为实现农业机械化培养技术人才，中共寿张县委又加强了对国防体育工作的领导，1958年以来，全县建立了很多国防体育俱乐部，广泛开展了射击、无线电、摩托车、跳伞和防空等各项活动。由于他们注意使体育活动为生产和国防建设服务，不仅增强了人民的体质，使发病率大大降低，出勤率大大提高，而且在今年抗旱斗争中还把手旗通讯、灯光通讯、无线电、土广播、摩托车等带到田间指挥生产，起了很大作用。由于国防体育活动与民兵训练紧密结合，还为国防建设培养了后备兵员。
    西石桥农业中学大办工厂、大搞技术革命和科学研究后，学生的知识更加丰富，思想也有显著进步
    江苏省江阴县西石桥农业中学代表吴子沐在发言中以这个学校两年多来的实践证明：政治挂帅，提高教学质量和搞好劳动生产，是巩固和提高农业中学的互相联系的重要关键。他说，农业中学的巩固和提高是战胜资产阶级教育思想的一个重大胜利。吴子沐介绍了这个学校在提高教学质量和生产自给方面辛勤努力克服种种客观困难和思想上的障碍而取得的重大成就。西石桥农业中学由于重视副业农业和工业生产，收入不断增加，供给范围和集体福利事业正在扩大和提高。教学方面，由于密切结合生产实际，加之劳动内容广泛而且全面，特别是由于大办工厂、大搞技术革新和科学研究，学生知识领域因而更加广泛丰富和切合实际，思想上的进步也更加显著。
    演唱了二十多年西河大鼓的河北省曲艺队演员孙来奎，在发言中谈到他是怎样遵循党的文艺方针上山下乡、深入生活、紧密配合中心任务进行创作的。孙来奎说，今后我要戒骄戒躁，鼓足更大的干劲，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，争取在1960年做出更大的成绩。
    在下午的大会上第一个发言的是山西省平遥县综合大学代表邓峰。他在发言中介绍了他们自办大学的情况和经验。他说，在1958年大跃进中诞生的平遥县综合大学，已经发展成从幼儿园到大学的“一条龙”的新型学校。目前大学部有二年制师范专科两个班，三年制工业专科一个班，共有学生六十二人；连同中学部、小学部、幼儿园，现在共有学生二千四百零四人。邓峰说，在八年内他们要为全县培养出一千余名大学生。
    坚决贯彻党的文艺方针，冲破美术电影难以反映现实生活的旧思想，充分表现我国劳动人民的豪情壮志
    上海美术电影制片厂代表胡进庆发言说：我厂发扬了首创精神，冲破了认为美术电影难以反映现实生活的旧思想，大跃进以来，密切配合当前政治斗争，拍摄了充满伟大时代生活气息、表现我国劳动人民豪情壮志以及当前技术革新、技术革命为内容的美术片“歌唱总路线”、“赶英国”、“庆丰收”、“小鲤鱼跳龙门”、“大跃进万岁”、“布谷鸟叫迟了”、“小农艺家”、“小发明家”等等。而且还创制了剪纸片、折纸片和水墨动画片，把极为丰富的民间艺术和瑰丽多采的传统艺术搬上了美术片银幕。他说，今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，坚决贯彻执行党的文艺方针，使美术电影艺术更紧密地为无产阶级政治服务。
    国营天津电器厂高举毛泽东思想红旗，在职工业余教育方面深入开展教学改革，获得了显著成绩。今天这个工厂的代表叶茂林在大会上发言说，由于教学改革的深入开展，有力地促进了这个厂职工教育的大发展，大提高。1959年底，全厂已建立由六十八个班组成的从小学到大学的教育体系，职工入学率达到98．2％，出席率稳定在90％以上。今年4月，全厂彻底扫除了文盲。职工政治、文化、技术水平的迅速提高，已成为推动工厂生产持续大跃进的重要动力。
    叶茂林表示，今后要本着不断革命精神，进一步加强领导，加强计划性，学习兄弟单位的经验，更加深入地开展教学改革，多快好省地培养建设人才，使职工教育更加适应社会主义建设持续跃进的需要。
    安徽日报积极贯彻全党办报方针，更加紧密地联系实际，联系群众
    安徽日报代表仲冲向大会介绍了安徽日报贯彻全党办报方针的情况。仲冲说，全党办报是毛主席一贯的办报思想，是党报工作的根本方针。在大跃进的新形势下，安徽深入开展了全党办报运动，运动的主要特点是：党委加强了对报纸工作的领导，逐级建立了第一书记挂帅的写作组，在办报工作中实行“两条腿走路”和“三结合”的方法。他说，“两条腿”，就整个新闻队伍讲，有专业与非专业；就非专业队伍讲，有党委直接领导的写作组，有分布在各个战线、各个角落的通讯员。“三结合”，就整个报纸工作讲，是党委领导、专业新闻工作者与广大通讯员相结合；就一篇重要稿件的写作讲，是领导干部、编写人员和群众相结合；就写作组的工作方法讲，是学习、工作、写作三者相结合。仲冲还叙述了安徽省深入开展全党办报运动以来初步的收获。
    河南省汲县上乐村小学代表田雪熙在发言中，介绍了这个学校进行语文教学改革的成绩和经验。他说，这个学校的学生们写的文章大都具有鲜明的思想性，语句通顺，层次较分明，能正确地反映现实生活和表达自己的思想情感。语文写作教学的大跃进也带动了其它各科教学质量的提高。学生通过参加社会政治运动、生产劳动和开展“读红书”运动，共产主义觉悟大大提高，劳动热情空前高涨，阶级观点也更加明确。
    中国人民解放军南京部队前线话剧团代表江泓介绍了这个话剧团在毛主席文艺思想指导下和党的坚强领导下，执行文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的方针所取得的成绩。他们这个话剧团早在抗日战争和解放战争时期，就活跃在大江南北和淮河两岸，紧密配合战斗任务，创作和演出了大批剧目。全国解放后的十年中，他们又坚持以创作现代题材、反映革命斗争、描写英雄人物为主的创作道路，并广泛展开演出活动。1958年一年就演出了一千二百八十八场，平均每天演出三场半，收到了部队上千封表扬信。（附图片）
