Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 27th: Shanghai's 40,000 militiamen held a powerful anti-U.S. imperialism demonstration today, denouncing the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and expressing their firm determination to liberate Taiwan.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Lu Dingyi, and members of the CPC Central Committee Deng Yingchao, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Mayor of Shanghai Ke Qingshi, and leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Party, government, and army attended today's meeting.

People's Square in Shanghai today was filled with red flags and huge banners, creating a magnificent atmosphere. Shanghai militiamen, filled with deep hatred for U.S. imperialism, marched out of factories, schools, rural areas, and government offices this afternoon, carrying various weapons, and converged on the People's Square in the city center from all directions. The eight militia divisions participating in the meeting formed neat formations on the square. Rows of light and heavy machine guns and mortars were set up in front of the orderly ranks. The militiamen were all high-spirited, shouting slogans such as "Resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists' military threats and war provocations against our country!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Asia!" which resounded throughout the venue.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao for all people to be soldiers and to establish militia divisions on a large scale, Shanghai's militia organizations have undergone rapid development and growth. Among the militia ranks standing proudly on the square today are worker pickets who participated in the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, demobilized volunteer soldiers who taught U.S. imperialism a lesson on the Korean battlefield, demobilized and transferred soldiers who have made contributions to defending the motherland, advanced producers in factories, production experts from rural people's communes, "three-good" students, and train attendants who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Today, they proudly accepted the review of the Party and state leaders.

Also present at today's meeting were Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, and Ma Tianshui, secretaries of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee; Shi Ximin and Liu Shuzhou, alternate secretaries; Song Jiwen, Song Richang, and Jin Zhonghua, vice mayors of Shanghai; Lieutenant General Wang Bicheng, Vice Admiral Tao Yong, Lieutenant General Kang Zhiqiang, Major General Li Binshan, and Major General Jiang Tengjiao, commanders of the PLA troops stationed in Shanghai; Hu Juewen and Liu Jingji, vice chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC; Zhao Zukang, Chen Wangdao, Sheng Pihua, Wu Ruo'an, Zhou Gucheng, Lu Yudao, and Xie Xuetang, heads of the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties; Zhong Min, Li Qitao, and Guo Jian, heads of various people's organizations; and heads of various departments of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee.

When Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Lu Dingyi, Comrade Deng Yingchao, and Mayor Ke Qingshi and others ascended the rostrum, the audience applauded warmly and continuously.

At 4:00 PM, Lieutenant General Wang Bicheng, commander of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, announced the start of the "Shanghai Militiamen's Anti-U.S. Imperialism Demonstration."

Chen Pixian, Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Political Commissar of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. He said that U.S. imperialism has forcibly occupied our country's sacred territory of Taiwan for a full ten years. U.S. imperialism has been stepping up war preparations in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, directly using force to obstruct our people from liberating Taiwan, constantly carrying out military provocations against our country, threatening our country's security, and undermining peace in Asia and the world. It has also been playing the "two Chinas" conspiracy, attempting to turn Taiwan into a permanent U.S. colony as a springboard for launching aggressive wars against our country and Asia. Taiwan has become a living hell under the armed occupation of U.S. imperialism. Our people will absolutely not tolerate these heinous crimes committed by the American robbers. He sternly warned the U.S. aggressors that the Chinese people cannot be bullied, and that every debt that U.S. imperialism owes to the Chinese people must be repaid. U.S. imperialism will never escape the just trial and punishment of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Chen Pixian said that our people's determination to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and complete the reunification of the motherland is unshakable. Our people must liberate the compatriots in Taiwan from their deep suffering, smash the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and complete the great cause of unifying the motherland.

Chen Pixian pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world and the most ferocious enemy of world peace. U.S. imperialism is deliberately playing the trick of "fake peace, real war preparations; fake relaxation, real aggression," but it cannot deceive the people of various countries or alleviate the deep hatred of the people of various countries for U.S. imperialism. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are launching a just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and are constantly achieving new victories. He said: The people of Asia and other countries are increasingly clearly recognizing the irrefutable truth: The aggressive nature of imperialism will never change, and the achievement of world peace should mainly rely on the close unity and resolute struggle of the people of all countries. Only by forming the broadest united front against imperialism, carrying out a tit-for-tat and resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, thoroughly exposing the aggressive and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and isolating U.S. imperialism to the maximum extent can we stop war and defend world peace. He pointed out that the just struggles of the people of the world support each other, and our people's struggle against U.S. imperialism has received the support of the people of the world. At the same time, our people resolutely support the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism. We resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country, resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

Chen Pixian said that Chairman Mao taught us: Our country should not only have a strong regular army, but also establish militia divisions on a large scale. In this way, when imperialism invades our country, it will be impossible for them to move an inch. The strength of the people is the decisive factor in the outcome of war. Although U.S. imperialism has a large amount of steel, huge military equipment, and even atomic weapons, what determines the outcome of war is not weapons, but the awakened and united people. To deal with imperialist wars of aggression, the most important thing is to mobilize the people, rely on the people, and carry out people's war. It is fundamentally wrong to only see that imperialism has atomic weapons and is seemingly powerful, but not see that the broad masses of people resisting imperialism are truly powerful, to succumb to the pressure of imperialism, and to beg imperialism for peace. With a powerful People's Liberation Army mastering modern military technology and a powerful mass armed force, our national defense will truly become an impregnable wall. Our country will not fear any threat or aggression from any imperialism.

Finally, he called on all militiamen in the city to be good sons and daughters of the Party, shock workers in production, vanguards in technological innovation and revolution, good soldiers in national defense, and excellent athletes in sports. They should be vigilant against the aggressive and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, vigilant against U.S. imperialism directing and dispatching counter-revolutionaries to carry out conspiracies and sabotage, and resolutely participate in the great struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, we must drown them in the vast ocean of all our people being soldiers.

Next, the commander of the Shanghai Jiaotong University Militia Division and representatives of militiamen from workers, peasants, students, government cadres, and demobilized soldiers spoke at the meeting.

95% of the teachers and students of Jiaotong University participated in the militia organization, forming a militia division. Today, Xie Bangzhi, the commander and political commissar of this division, resolutely expressed the division's determination to fight against U.S. imperialist aggression and to liberate Taiwan on behalf of all the militiamen of the university. He said: We must act more resolutely, study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, strengthen our class stand, carry out teaching revolution, strive to do a good job in teaching, rapidly climb the peak of science, and actively participate in the technological innovation and revolution movement. We must actively learn military technology and develop a brave and tenacious spirit to build our militia division into a strong fighting unit for building and defending the motherland.

Zhang Xisheng, chief of staff of the 5th Regiment of the Jiangnan Shipyard Militia and representative of the worker militia, strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's crime of invading our country's territory of Taiwan and plotting to create "two Chinas." He said: Our worker militia guarantees to the Party that we will resolutely implement the policy of "combining labor and military affairs," do a good job in production, and train well in military affairs, so that we are workers in the factory and soldiers with guns, ready to strike at the aggressive U.S. imperialist robbers at any time.

Zhu Yuqi, a peasant militia representative and platoon leader of the female militia of the Zhangqiao People's Commune in Pudong County, said: U.S. imperialism is like the cutworm pest in the cotton field. If there are cutworms, they will harm the cotton and destroy production. If there is imperialism, there is a root cause for war. This
"paper tiger" of U.S. imperialism should be dealt with in the same way as cutworms are dealt with – through resolute struggle in order to defend peace. In order to strengthen our national defense and defend our motherland, we must actively learn military technology and improve our skills in defending the motherland while engaging in production.

Zhang Zhiliang, a militia representative from Jiguang Middle School, Yao Qiang, a militia representative from the directly subordinate organs of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and Zhang Jianming, a representative of demobilized and transferred soldiers, also spoke at the meeting. Zhang Jianming said in his speech that many of the demobilized and transferred soldiers had personally fought against U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield, and we have completely seen through that U.S. imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. If it does not accept the lessons of its crushing defeat on the Korean battlefield and dares to launch a war of aggression, we will wipe it out. He said that all demobilized and transferred soldiers must play a backbone role in militia training activities. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, all demobilized and transferred soldiers and militiamen will immediately take up arms and smash U.S. imperialism to pieces.

After the representatives spoke, the audience shouted slogans. Then, the powerful militia ranks marched past the rostrum, accepting the review of the Party and state leaders. After the review, the militia ranks held a massive demonstration parade on six routes amidst the majestic songs of "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers" and "We Must Liberate Taiwan." The men and women militiamen stood tall, marching in neat steps, onto the streets. Wherever the procession went, the masses on both sides of the street shouted anti-U.S. imperialist aggression slogans along with them.

Capital's 50,000 Militiamen Issue Bold Statements
    Ready to Defend the Motherland and Liberate Taiwan

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: Today, 50,000 men and women militiamen in the capital held a strong anti-American demonstration, resolutely opposing U.S. imperialist aggression against our country's sacred territory of Taiwan. Filled with anger, the 50,000 militiamen waved their arms and shouted: We must liberate Taiwan! Resolutely overthrow U.S. imperialism!
  Today, ten years ago—on the third day of the U.S. imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people all over the world, launching the war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. used armed force to occupy our country's territory Taiwan and turned the island of Taiwan into a dark hell.

The Chinese people who have stood up will never forget this great shame and humiliation. At dawn today, the capital's militiamen, in unified command, came in formation, and converged on Tiananmen. Amidst the morning mist, the square in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Tiananmen echoed with earth-shattering slogans. Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and Political Commissar of the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, emphasized in his speech at today's meeting that the 650 million Chinese people must smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas," must liberate Taiwan, and must complete the great cause of unifying all of China.

Liu Ren sternly warned, "If U.S. imperialism stubbornly refuses to leave Taiwan, the great Chinese people will definitely drive it back to its old home!"

Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, participated in this anti-U.S. imperialism demonstration together with the fully armed militiamen.

Also participating in the meeting were Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Zaiwen, Secretary of the Secretariat, Yang Zhihua, Vice President of the All-China Women's Federation, Wang Wei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of Education, Senior Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Aiping, Xiao Hua, Gan Siqi, Fu Qiutao, and Yang Yong, Wan Li, Vice Mayor of Beijing, and heads of people's organizations and democratic parties in Beijing.

Today, the flags of many "Militia Divisions" fluttered in the wind in the square of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. In front of the square, rows of light and heavy machine guns and mortars were lined up. These militiamen from factories, rural areas, government offices, and schools were almost all young people in their twenties and thirties. Standing proudly in neat ranks, they held weapons and shouted slogans, singing war songs. "Six hundred million people are eager to try, the militiamen in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony are full of fighting spirit, machine guns, rifles, 60-caliber cannons, all aimed at the American wolf..." This is the voice of hundreds of millions of militiamen in the great motherland, holding weapons and preparing at any time, ready to heed the call of the motherland at any time.

Today's militia demonstration was presided over by Wu Lie, Commander of the Beijing Garrison. In his opening remarks, he said, "We resolutely oppose the U.S. occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, resolutely oppose the U.S. conspiracy to create 'two Chinas,' resolutely oppose the U.S. undermining world peace and plotting new wars, and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's crimes of enslaving and oppressing the people of all countries."

Wu Lie emphasized, "Now our country not only has a modernized regular army but also a powerful militia. The era of the Chinese people being bullied is gone forever."

This general expressed the strong confidence of the Chinese people in resisting aggression and defending the motherland. He called on the capital's militiamen to be more vigilant, strengthen training, step up production and construction, be prepared to counter imperialist aggression and provocation at any time and anywhere, and strive to liberate our country's territory of Taiwan, defend the security of the motherland, and defend world peace.

Amidst thunderous applause, Liu Ren took the stage to speak. He reiterated that Taiwan has been China's territory since ancient times, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The 650 million Chinese people must complete the great cause of unifying all of China.

Liu Ren strongly condemned, "You reap what you sow, and those who sow hatred will suffer themselves! All the acts of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people, every debt of blood owed, must be repaid!"

In his speech, Liu Ren talked about the crimes of U.S. imperialism using our country's Taiwan Strait to continuously carry out aggression and war provocations against our country for ten years, and refuted the shameless slander of the American robber chieftain Eisenhower and his lackeys who unscrupulously slandered our people's just struggle to liberate the territory of the motherland as "aggression," "belligerence," and "aggravating tensions." He said, "The people of the world can see very clearly that it is U.S. imperialism that is violating China's territorial sovereignty, interfering in China's internal affairs, and creating tensions in the Far East. Only by driving the U.S. imperialists out of Taiwan can peace in the Far East and Asia be maintained."

Liu Ren pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries in Asia and the world. At present, under the situation where the East Wind is increasingly overpowering the West Wind, the cunning American robbers sometimes have to pretend to be peaceful, but their aggressive nature will never change, and their jackal nature cannot be concealed.

Liu Ren said, "The people of the world must not have any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism, such a most ferocious enemy, but must carry out a resolute struggle. When U.S. imperialism carries out war threats and launches wars of aggression, we must dare to fight back and not be intimidated by it; when U.S. imperialism plays peace conspiracies, we must see through and expose its deceptive tricks and not fall into its trap. The more resolute and thorough this struggle is carried out, the more effectively it will defend peace in Asia and the world."

Liu Ren highly praised the heroic struggles of the people of Japan, South Korea, Turkey, and other countries in Asia, believing that these struggles have forcefully attacked the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war and made significant contributions to defending world peace. The patriotic and anti-American just struggle of the people of various Asian countries must achieve final victory.

Liu Ren said, "Our Chinese people have always opposed wars of aggression and strived to defend peace in Asia and the world. Precisely because of this, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to plot aggression and war and constantly strengthen our national defense. We must not only strengthen the building of a modernized regular army but also establish militia divisions on a large scale. This is a fundamental measure for us to defend against imperialist aggression and defend socialist construction." "If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our country, we must drown them in the vast ocean of all our people being soldiers."

Liu Ren's speech was constantly interrupted by waves of slogans. People shouted in unison: "U.S. imperialism get out of our country's territory of Taiwan!"

Next, representatives of the capital's militiamen took the stage to speak one by one. With full of anger, they spoke eloquently, warning U.S. imperialism: If they dare to impose war on the Chinese people, they will immediately respond to the call of the motherland and immediately join the battle. Every commune, every factory and mine, and every school in our country will become a strong fighting fortress.

Zhou Guanwu, Commander of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Militia Division, said that to deal with U.S. imperialism, we must carry out a tit-for-tat struggle. To deal with wolves, we must have tools to fight wolves. To deal with U.S. imperialist war provocations, we must have our own revolutionary armed forces. Against U.S. imperialist aggression and oppression, we can only resolutely resist, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

He said that our Capital Iron and Steel Militia Division is determined to fight alongside the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the liberation of Taiwan. We must work hard in production to increase steel production and take up guns to be ready at all times, stepping up military technical training. We guarantee to do: to have iron when iron is needed, to have steel when steel is needed, and to have people when people are needed. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the people of our country, as long as we hear the call of the motherland, we will immediately join the battle. We must let the U.S. imperialists know that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with!

Zhao Shumin, a representative of the worker militia, said that every debt of blood owed to our people by U.S. imperialism must be settled. It is the sacred duty of our militia to defend the integrity of our country's territory and liberate the Taiwan compatriots who are in deep suffering. All our worker militia must strengthen military training, continuously improve our political consciousness and military skills, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time!

Li Shiming, a peasant militia representative from the famous Lugouqiao People's Commune Militia Division, said that on this day, the tenth anniversary of U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of our country's sacred territory of Taiwan, all the militiamen in Lugouqiao cannot help but feel anger in their hearts. Everyone gritted their teeth, hating U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions, and determined to work hard to improve production, practice good skills, and be ready at all times to support the People's Liberation Army, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace. He said that we will never give up until we drive the American wolf back to its lair! We must bring out the strength of Wu Song fighting the tiger and resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of the sacred territory of our motherland, Taiwan.

Xing Wenqiao, a representative of the government office militia, said that the American warmongers think they have a large amount of steel, huge military equipment, and even atomic weapons in their hands. But what does that count for?! We believe that in the history of the world, what determines the fate of mankind is the revolutionary struggle of the masses of the people, not any new-style weapons. Imperialist war intimidation can only scare those who are neurasthenic but can never scare our revolutionary people. He said that all the militiamen in the government offices in the capital guarantee to do a good job in government work, practice good skills to defend the motherland, constantly improve revolutionary vigilance, and be ready at any time to respond to the great call of the Party and the motherland.

Luo Jianmin, a student militia representative, said that the student militiamen in the capital swear to the great motherland: We must study hard and step up military exercises to strive to build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and Culture, modern national defense! Our capital's militia is ready at any time to liberate our motherland's sacred territory of Taiwan together with the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. If imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate it from the earth!

Yang Yumin, a representative of demobilized and retired soldiers, who is a backbone in the militia, said that he had participated in the Chinese People's Volunteers and, together with the Korean People's Army, defeated the American aggressors. He said that the invaders are paper tigers that are strong on the outside but weak on the inside and have long been exposed in their true colors in front of the Chinese and Korean people. He warned U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower: Your robber army is our defeated enemy! If you forget the heavy lessons of the war of aggression against Korea and dare to launch a new war of aggression, all our demobilized soldiers will return to the front line and beat you to a pulp again.

These heroic voices from the militia representatives constantly stirred up bursts of warm applause and slogans.

After the speeches, Marshal Chen Yi, General Luo Ruiqing, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and heads of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, walked down the rostrum and reviewed the militia ranks. As Marshal Chen Yi and others passed in front of the neatly arranged militia ranks, the heroic militiamen applauded warmly, sang "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers" in unison, and constantly shouted rhythmically: "Be ready at any time, take up arms, defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan" and other slogans.

After the meeting ended, five thousand militiamen, braving the heavy rain, marched out of the square in formation. They passed through the streets and alleys, shouting slogans, forming a powerful demonstration.

Envoys and diplomatic officials of various socialist countries in China, some foreign guests in Beijing, foreign experts and students, participated in today's meeting.

Tianjin Militiamen's Demonstration Turns Into an Ocean of Anger
    Must Give the Aggressors a Fatal Blow

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 27th: Today, 30,000 militiamen in Tianjin held an anti-U.S. imperialism demonstration at Minyuan Stadium. Basic-level militiamen from various factories and urban people's communes throughout the city, fully armed student militia from various universities, and the Red Star Militia Division composed of government cadres, among others, carrying rifles, light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons, participated in the meeting proudly and energetically.

Wan Xiaotang, First Secretary of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and Political Commissar of the Tianjin Militia, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that we are currently in an era where the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind. The strength of the socialist camp is growing stronger day by day, and the struggles of the people of all countries in the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are rising to an even greater extent. The united front of the people of the world against imperialism is constantly being strengthened and expanded, and imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys are surrounded by the people of the world. Wan Xiaotang said that the people of Tianjin, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism still occupies our country's sacred territory of Taiwan and is plotting to create "two Chinas." U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia and the world. He called on all militiamen in the city to continuously improve their political consciousness, actively participate in production and construction, actively learn military skills, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, take up arms, and cooperate with the powerful People's Liberation Army to give a fatal blow to any aggressors who dare to invade our country. The militiamen in the audience constantly shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Resolutely liberate Taiwan!"

Militia representatives from workers, peasants, urban people's commune members, commercial employees, cadres, women, and students who spoke at the meeting solemnly expressed the firm will of the people of the city to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and to liberate Taiwan. Their speeches constantly aroused waves of slogans from the audience.

Responsible persons from the Party and government of Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality, responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as commanders and high-ranking officers of the Hebei Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and troops stationed in Tianjin, attended the meeting. Experts and foreign guests from various fraternal countries in Tianjin also participated in the meeting.

After the meeting, 30,000 militiamen divided into six routes to hold a powerful demonstration parade.

Walking at the front of the steel militia division were Wan Xiaotang, First Secretary of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and Political Commissar of the Tianjin Militia, Major General Meng Qingshan, Deputy Commander of the Hebei Military Region, Major General Fang Zhizhong, Commander of the Tianjin Garrison, Major General Wang Zhiping, Political Commissar, and Major General Ding Laifu, commander of the troops stationed in Tianjin.

The militiamen of the state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory who attended the National Militia Representative Meeting today, carrying heavy machine guns, rifles, and pistols, enthusiastically shouted slogans against U.S. imperialism. Lin Changping, an old militiaman from Ningjin County, also came to participate in the demonstration. This old hero, who had led the militia to compete with the enemy more than a hundred times and captured more than a hundred guns from the enemy in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, said indignantly today that we must liberate Taiwan, and we cannot allow U.S. imperialism to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, the net laid by our militia will make it impossible for it to escape. More than 80 artillery veterans who had demonstrated with artillery to the war peddler Dulles on the Fujian front more than a year ago shouted with the demonstrating militiamen today: "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan!" Li Meihua, who won the title of artillery expert, said that if U.S. imperialism refuses to leave Taiwan, we must drive it into the sea!

The majestic militia demonstration ranks and the tens of thousands of people who automatically gathered on the streets formed an ocean of anger. The roars condemning U.S. imperialism echoed each other, shaking the streets and alleys. Song Yunzhen, the company commander of the militia of the Quanyechang People's Commune, pointed to the militia ranks and said: "All people being soldiers means great strength. In the past, we defeated Japanese imperialism and punctured the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. Now our strength is even greater." (Attached picture)

    中共上海市委书记处书记、中国人民解放军上海警备区政治委员陈丕显在大会上讲了话。他说，美帝国主义用武力侵占我国神圣领土台湾整整十年了，美帝国主义一直在台湾和台湾海峡地区加紧备战，直接以武力阻挠我国人民解放台湾，不断向我国进行军事挑衅，威胁我国安全，破坏亚洲和世界和平，并且一直在玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，妄图把台湾变成美国的永久殖民地，作为对我国和亚洲发动侵略战争的跳板。我国台湾在美帝国主义武力侵占之下，已经变成人间地狱，我国人民绝对不能容忍美国强盗犯下的这些滔天罪行。他严厉地警告美国侵略者，中国人民是不可欺侮的，美帝国主义欠中国人民的每一笔账都是要偿还的。美帝国主义决不能逃脱中国人民和全世界人民的正义审判和惩罚。
    陈丕显说，我国人民解放自己的领土台湾、完成祖国的统一的决心是不可动摇的。我国人民一定要把台湾同胞从水深火热的痛苦生活中解放出来，一定要粉碎“两个中国”的阴谋，完成统一祖国的伟大事业。
    陈丕显指出，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，是世界和平的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义处心积虑地玩弄“假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略”的诡计，但是，它欺骗不了各国人民，减轻不了各国人民对美帝国主义的血海深仇。全世界人民决不会饶恕它们。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民正在掀起反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争，并且不断取得新的胜利。他说：亚洲和各国人民愈来愈清楚地认定了这样一条颠扑不破的真理：帝国主义的侵略本性是永远也不会改变的，世界和平的取得，主要应当依靠各国人民的紧密团结和坚决斗争。只有结成最广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的坚决斗争，彻底地揭露美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋，使美帝国主义陷于最大限度的孤立，才能够制止战争，保卫世界和平。他指出，全世界人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的，我国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，得到了全世界人民的支持。同时，我国人民坚决支持全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们坚决支持朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国的正义斗争，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争，坚决支持越南人民为和平统一越南而进行的正义斗争。
    陈丕显说，毛主席教导我们：我国不但要有强大的正规军，还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使它们寸步难行。人民的力量是战争胜负的决定因素。美帝国主义虽然有大量的钢铁，庞大的军事装备，还有原子武器，但是，决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是觉醒和团结起来的人民。对付帝国主义侵略战争，最主要的就是动员人民、依靠人民、实行人民战争。只见帝国主义拥有原子武器貌似强大的一方，不见广大人民反抗帝国主义真正强大的一方，屈服于帝国主义的压力，向帝国主义乞求和平，是根本错误的。我们有了一支强大的掌握现代军事技术的人民解放军，又有了一支强大的群众武装力量，我们的国防就真正成为铜墙铁壁。我国就不怕任何帝国主义的威胁和侵略。
    最后，他号召全市民兵人人都要作党的好儿女，生产上的突击手，技术革新和技术革命中的尖兵，国防上的好战士，体育上的优秀运动员，要对美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋提高警惕，对美帝国主义指使和派遣反革命分子进行阴谋破坏提高警惕，坚决参加反对美帝国主义侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的伟大斗争。如果美帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，我们就一定要使它们淹死在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。
    接着，上海交通大学民兵师师长和工人、农民、学生、机关干部和复员转业军人的民兵代表在会上讲了话。
    交通大学全校有95％的师生参加了民兵组织，组成了一个民兵师。今天这个师的师长兼政治委员谢邦治在大会上代表全校民兵坚决表示反对美帝国主义侵略、一定要解放台湾的战斗决心。他说：我们一定要更加坚决地行动，要更加努力学习毛泽东思想，坚定阶级立场，进行教学革命，努力做好教学工作，迅速攀登科学高峰，积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动。要积极学习军事技术、养成勇敢顽强的精神，把我们的民兵师建成一个为建设祖国、保卫祖国的坚强战斗单位。
    江南造船厂民兵第五团参谋长、工人民兵代表张锡生在讲话中严厉谴责了美帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾、阴谋制造“两个中国”的罪行。他说：我们工人民兵向党保证，坚决贯彻“劳武结合”的方针，做到生产好，练兵好，做到进厂是工人，拿枪是军人，随时准备打击美帝国主义侵略强盗。
    农民民兵代表、浦东县张桥人民公社女民兵排排长朱玉琪说：美帝国主义就像棉花田里的害虫“地老虎”一样，有地老虎就要伤害棉花，破坏生产，有帝国主义，就存在着发生战争的根源。对待美帝国主义这只
  “纸老虎”，就应该像对待“地老虎”一样进行坚决斗争，才能保卫和平。为了增强国防力量，保卫祖国，我们一定要在搞生产的同时，积极学习军事技术，提高保卫祖国的本领。
    继光中学的民兵代表张志良，上海市人民委员会直属机关民兵代表姚强，复员转业军人代表张剑明都在会上讲了话。张剑明在讲话中说，复员转业军人中有很多人曾经在朝鲜战场上亲身和美帝国主义较量过，我们完全看透了美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。如果它不接受在朝鲜战场上遭到惨败的教训，胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就要把它消灭掉。他表示，全体复员转业军人一定要在民兵训练活动中起骨干带头作用，如果美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，全体复员转业军人和民兵，立即拿起武器，把美帝国主义打得粉身碎骨。
    在代表们讲话结束后，全场高呼口号。接着，强大的民兵队伍走过主席台，接受了党和国家领导人的检阅。检阅结束后，民兵队伍在雄壮的“志愿军战歌”、“一定要解放台湾”的歌声中，分六路举行了声势浩大的示威游行。男女民兵们挺起胸膛，踏着整齐的步伐，走上大街。队伍走过之处，街道两旁的群众，和他们一同高呼反对美帝国主义侵略的口号。
          首都五万民兵发出豪言壮语
    时刻准备着保卫祖国解放台湾
    新华社27日讯　今天首都五万男女民兵举行强硬的反美示威大会，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略我国的神圣领土台湾。气昂昂的五万民兵健儿怀着激愤的心情振臂高呼：我们一定要解放台湾！坚决打倒美帝国主义！
  十年前的今天——全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义在发动侵略朝鲜战争的第三天，用武力侵占了我国领土台湾，把台湾宝岛变成了暗无天日的人间地狱。
    站立起来了的中国人民永远不能忘记这一奇耻大辱。今天拂晓，首都的民兵就在统一的号令下戎装结队而来，向天安门集中。在晨雾弥漫中，天安门内太和殿前的广场上，响起了震天动地的口号声。中共北京市委第二书记、中国人民解放军北京卫戍区政治委员刘仁在今天大会上讲话时强调说，六亿五千万中国人民，一定要粉碎美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，一定要解放台湾，一定要完成统一全中国的伟大事业。
    刘仁严正地警告说：“如果美帝国主义死赖在台湾不滚蛋，伟大的中国人民就一定要把它赶回老家去”！
    国务院副总理陈毅元帅，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若等人，同全副武装的民兵一起参加了这个反对美帝国主义的示威大会。
    参加大会的还有，中国国民党革命委员会副主席蔡廷锴，中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，外交部副部长章汉夫、罗贵波，中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜、书记处书记栗再温，全国妇联副主席杨之华，共青团中央书记处书记王伟，教育部副部长刘皑风，中国人民解放军高级将领张爱萍上将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、傅秋涛上将、杨勇上将，北京市副市长万里，以及北京市各人民团体和各民主党派北京市组织的负责人等。
    今天，在太和殿的广场上，许多“民兵师”的大旗迎风招展。广场的前面，摆列着成排的轻重机枪和迫击炮。这些来自工厂、农村、机关、学校的民兵们，几乎全是二三十岁的青年人。他们威武地排列着严整的队伍，持着武器高呼口号，高唱战歌。“六亿人民摩拳擦掌，太和殿前民兵斗志昂，机枪、步枪、六○炮， 一齐对准美国狼。……”这是伟大祖国亿万民兵的声音，他们手持武器时刻准备着，准备随时听候祖国的召唤。
    今天的民兵示威大会由北京卫戍区司令员吴烈主持。他在致开会词时说：“我们坚决反对美国霸占我国领土台湾，坚决反对美国制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，坚决反对美国破坏世界和平、策划新战争的罪恶活动，坚决反对美帝国主义奴役和压迫各国人民的罪行。”
    吴烈强调说，“现在我国不仅有现代化的正规军，而且有强大的民兵队伍。中国人民任人欺凌的时代，已经一去不复返了。”
    这位将军表示了中国人民反抗侵略保卫祖国的坚强信心。他号召首都的民兵们，更要提高警惕，加强训练，加紧生产建设，准备好随时随地给帝国主义的侵略挑衅活动以反击，为解放我国的领土台湾，保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    在雷动的掌声中，刘仁登台讲话，他重申：台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。六亿五千万中国人民，一定要完成统一全中国的伟大事业。
    刘仁强烈地谴责说：“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，谁种下了仇恨，谁就自己遭殃！美帝国主义对中国人民所犯下的一切侵略罪行，所欠下的每一笔血债，都是一定要偿还的！”
    刘仁在讲话中谈到了十年来美帝国主义利用我国的台湾海峡，不断地对我国进行侵略和战争挑衅的罪行，驳斥了美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔及其走狗们无耻地诬蔑我国人民解放祖国领土的正义斗争是“侵略”、“好战”、“加剧紧张局势”等谰言。他说：“全世界人民都看得很清楚，正是美帝国主义侵犯中国领土主权，干涉中国内政，造成了远东的紧张局势。只有把美帝国主义者从台湾赶出去，才能维护远东和亚洲的和平。”
    刘仁指出，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，也是亚洲各国人民和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。目前在东风越来越有力地压倒西风的形势之下，狡猾的美国强盗有时也不得不伪装和平，但是它的侵略本性是至死不变的，它的豺狼本性也是掩盖不了的。
    刘仁说：“全世界人民对美帝国主义这样一个最凶恶的敌人，决不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而必须进行坚决的斗争。当美帝国主义进行战争威胁和发动侵略战争的时候，我们一定要敢于进行反击，不要被他吓倒；当美帝国主义玩弄和平阴谋的时候，我们一定要识破和揭穿它的骗人手法，不要上它的圈套。这个斗争进行得越坚决、越彻底，就越能有效地保卫亚洲和世界的和平。”
    刘仁高度地评价了日本、南朝鲜、土耳其和亚洲各国人民的英勇斗争，认为这些斗争有力地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，对保卫世界和平作出了重大的贡献。亚洲各国人民反美爱国的正义斗争，一定要取得最后的胜利。
    刘仁说：“我们中国人民从来反对侵略战争，并且为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。正因为这样，我们对于美帝国主义策划侵略和战争的阴谋，必须保持高度的警惕，不断地加强我们的国防。我们既要加强现代化的正规军的建设，又要大办民兵师，这是我们防御帝国主义侵略、保卫社会主义建设的根本措施。”“如果帝国主义者敢于对我国发动侵略战争，我们就一定要使它们淹没在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。”
    刘仁的讲话不断为此起彼伏的口号声所打断。人们齐声高呼：“美帝国主义从我国领土台湾滚出去！”
    接着，首都民兵的代表一个个走上讲台讲话。他们怀着满腔的愤怒，激昂陈词，警告美帝国主义：如果胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，他们马上响应祖国的召唤，马上投入战斗。我国的每一个公社、每一个厂矿、学校，都将成为坚强的战斗堡垒。
    石景山钢铁公司民兵师师长周冠五说，对付美帝国主义，只有进行针锋相对的斗争。对付狼，就得有打狼的工具。对付美帝国主义的战争挑衅，就得有人民自己的革命武装。对美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，我们只有坚决地反抗，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。
    他说，我们首都钢铁民兵师，决心和中国人民解放军一起，为解放台湾而奋斗。我们要一手努力生产，增产钢铁，一手拿枪，随时戒备，加紧军事技术锻炼。我们保证作到：要铁有铁，要钢有钢，要人有人。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我国人民头上，我们只要听到祖国的一声召唤，马上投入战斗。我们要让美帝国主义者懂得中国人民是不好惹的！
    工人民兵代表赵淑敏说，美帝国主义欠下我国人民的每一笔血债，我们都一定要清算。保卫我们祖国领土的完整，解放水深火热中的台湾同胞，这是我们民兵的神圣职责。我们全体工人民兵要加强军事训练，不断地提高政治觉悟和军事本领，随时准备响应祖国对我们的召唤！
    农民民兵代表、来自著名的芦沟桥人民公社民兵师的李世明说，在美帝国主义武装侵占我国神圣领土台湾整整十年的今天，我们芦沟桥的全体民兵，忍不住心头怒火，人人咬牙切齿，痛恨美帝国主义的侵略行动，决心努力提高生产、练好本领，时刻准备支援解放军，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平。他说，不把美国野心狼赶回老窝去，我们绝不罢休！我们一定要拿出武松打虎的劲头，坚决为解放祖国神圣的领土台湾而奋斗到底。
    机关民兵代表邢文桥说，美国的战争狂人们以为他们手里有大量的钢铁，有庞大的军事装备，还有原子武器。可是，这又算得什么呢？！我们认为，在世界历史上，决定人类命运的是人民群众的革命斗争，而不是什么新式武器。帝国主义的战争恫吓，只能吓住那些神经衰弱的人，却绝对不能吓倒我们革命的人民。他表示，我们首都机关全体民兵保证做好机关工作，练好保卫祖国的本领，时刻提高革命警惕，随时准备响应党和祖国的伟大号召。
    学生民兵代表罗健敏说，首都的学生民兵，向伟大的祖国宣誓：我们一定要努力学习，加紧练兵，为把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国而奋斗！我们首都民兵随时准备和英雄的中国人民解放军一起，解放祖国神圣的领土台湾。帝国主义如果竟敢发动侵略战争，我们一定要坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把它从地球上消灭掉！
    作为民兵队伍里的骨干、转业退伍军人代表杨毓敏说，他曾参加中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军一道，打败了美国侵略军。他说侵略者是外强中干的纸老虎，在朝中人民面前早已原形毕露了。他警告美国帝国主义和艾森豪威尔说：你的强盗军队是我们的手下败将！如果你忘了侵朝战争的沉重教训，胆敢发动新的侵略战争，我们全体转业军人，将重返前线再打你一个落花流水。
    民兵代表们发出的这些英雄的声音，不断地激起一阵阵热烈的掌声和口号声。
    讲话结束以后，陈毅元帅、罗瑞卿大将，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，以及各人民团体、各民主党派、北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军们，走下主席台检阅了民兵队伍。当陈毅元帅等在队容严整的民兵行列前经过时，雄赳赳的民兵们热烈鼓掌，齐唱“中国人民志愿军战歌”，并且不断地有节奏地高呼：“时刻准备，拿起武器，保卫祖国，解放台湾”等口号。
    大会在高昂的“民兵战歌”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“社会主义好”的歌声中结束以后，五万民兵冒着大雨结队走出广场，他们穿过大街小巷，高呼口号，形成了强大的示威。
    各社会主义国家驻中国的使节和外交官员，在北京的部分外宾，各国专家和留学生，参加了今天的大会。
        天津民兵示威队伍汇成愤怒海洋
  一定要给侵略者以致命打击
    据新华社天津27日电　天津市今天有三万民兵在民园体育场举行反对美帝国主义示威大会。来自全市各工厂、各城市人民公社的基干民兵，来自各高等学校的全副武装的学生民兵队伍以及由机关干部组成的红星民兵师等，携带着步枪、轻重机枪等武器，雄赳赳气昂昂地参加了大会。
    中共天津市委第一书记、天津市民兵政治委员万晓塘在大会上讲了话。他指出，目前正处在东风进一步压倒西风的时代，社会主义阵营力量日益强大，世界各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争正在越来越大地兴起，世界人民反对帝国主义的统一战线正在不断地加强和扩大，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗已处在世界人民的包围之中。万晓塘表示天津市人民和全国人民一道，坚决支持朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而进行的正义斗争。他指出，美帝国主义至今还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”。美帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的死敌，是亚洲和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。他号召全市民兵不断提高政治觉悟，积极参加生产建设，积极学习军事本领，随时准备响应祖国的召唤，拿起武器配合强大的人民解放军，给胆敢侵犯我国的侵略者以致命的打击。全场民兵不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“坚决解放台湾！”
    在会上讲话的工人、农民、城市人民公社社员、商业职工、干部、妇女和学生等民兵代表，庄严地表达了全市人民反对美帝国主义侵略、一定要解放台湾的坚强意志。他们的讲话，不断激起全场怒涛般的口号声。
    河北省和天津市党和政府的负责人，各民主党派、各人民团体负责人，以及人民解放军河北军区和驻津部队首长、高级军官等都出席了大会。参加大会的还有在天津的各兄弟国家的专家和外宾们。
    会后，三万民兵分成六路举行了强大的示威游行。

    出席过全国民兵代表会议的国营天津印染厂的民兵，今天扛着重机枪，背着步枪，捺着手枪，激昂地高呼着反对美帝国主义的口号。宁津县老民兵林常平也赶来参加示威。这位在抗日战争和解放战争中，曾经带领民兵跟敌人较量过一百多次，缴获敌人一百多支枪的老英雄今天激愤地说，我们一定要解放台湾，我们不能容许美帝国主义继续霸占我国领土台湾。如果美帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们民兵布下的天罗地网管叫它插翅难飞。一年多前曾经在福建前线用大炮向战争贩子杜勒斯示威过的八十多名炮兵复员军人，今天和示威民兵一起高呼：“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去！”曾荣获炮兵能手称号的李梅华说，如果美帝国主义赖在台湾不走，我们一定要把它赶下大海去！
    威风凛凛的民兵示威队伍和自动聚集在街头的成千上万群众，汇成一片愤怒的海洋。谴责美帝国主义的吼声交相呼应，震荡着大街小巷。劝业场人民公社民兵连连长宋蕴珍指着民兵队伍说：“全民皆兵就是力量大，过去我们打败了日本帝国主义，在朝鲜战场上戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎，现在我们的力量更强大了。”（附图片）
