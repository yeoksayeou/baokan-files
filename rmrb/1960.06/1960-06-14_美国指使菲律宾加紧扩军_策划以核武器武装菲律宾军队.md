Xinhua News Agency, Manila dispatch: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Philippine government is stepping up its military expansion and preparations for war, cooperating with U.S. imperialism in creating tension in the Southeast Asian region.

The Philippine Congress's fiscal budget案 passed in mid-May, from July of this year to June of next year, shows that in this fiscal year, the Philippine government's military expenditure will reach more than 210 million pesos (at the official exchange rate, two pesos equal one U.S. dollar), an increase of more than 20 million pesos compared to the 1959 military budget. According to recent disclosures in Congress by Philippine Senator Tañada, in the past thirteen years, the Philippines' military expenditure has increased year by year, and the 1959 military expenditure has increased to three times that of 1947.

It is reported that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its plans to equip the Philippine army with nuclear weapons. Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Cabal went to Washington to discuss with the U.S. authorities the matter of equipping the Philippine army with "Nike-Hercules" type surface-to-air missiles. In addition, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive bloc controlled by the United States, decided to equip the Philippine army with U.S.-made rockets carrying nuclear warheads.

    美国指使菲律宾加紧扩军
    策划以核武器武装菲律宾军队
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾政府在美帝国主义指使下正加紧扩军备战，配合美帝国主义在东南亚地区制造紧张局势。
    菲律宾国会在5月中旬通过的从今年7月至明年6月的财政预算案表明：在这一财政年度中，菲律宾政府的军事开支将达两亿一千多万比索（按官方兑换率，两个比索合一美元），比1959年度军事预算增加了两千多万比索。据菲律宾参议员塔纳达最近在国会揭露，在过去十三年中，菲律宾的军事开支逐年增加，1959年度的军事开支已增加到相当于1947年的三倍。
    据报道，美帝国主义正在加紧策划以核武器装备菲律宾军队。菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺和武装部队参谋总长卡巴尔到华盛顿同美国当局研究以“奈克—赫尔克里士”式地对空导弹装备菲律宾军队的事宜。另外，美国控制下的东南亚条约组织侵略集团决定以带原子弹头的美制火箭装备菲律宾军队。
