    Saluting the Heroic Korean People
    Wei Chuantong
    Currently, the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and its running dogs is developing turbulently. In the Far East, the just struggle against American imperialism's aggression and in defense of world peace is like a prairie fire, and has become an irresistible historical trend. American imperialism's fate is not long, and its future is bleak. However, the American aggressors have never learned from history and remain enemies of the people of the world. It is certain that the result can only be to accelerate their own demise.

    Ten years ago today, American imperialism provoked the war of aggression against Korea. The American aggressors, with great fanfare, stole the United Nations' banner, gathered their lackeys, and launched a frenzied offensive against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They crossed the 38th parallel and went straight to the Yalu River, thoroughly exposing American imperialism's ambition to invade China, and to seize and enslave the people of Asia and the world, which aroused the great anger of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. The Korean people, in order to defend their country's independence and honor, resolutely rose up in self-defense. The Chinese people, in order to assist our close neighbor and defend the security and construction of our motherland, launched a vigorous movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, and organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to resist American imperialism. After more than three years of heroic fighting, the American aggressors were forced to accept armistice negotiations. Because justice was on our side, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army finally defeated the self-proclaimed number one American "paper tiger" under conditions of inferior equipment, greatly encouraging the determination and confidence of the people of the world in their anti-imperialist struggle, thus disrupting the American bandits' heinous plan to enslave the people of the world.

    The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people fighting shoulder to shoulder against American imperialist aggression eloquently proves that American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, strong in appearance but weak in reality. At the same time, it reveals to the people of the world the truth that awakened people cannot be deceived or defeated.

    After the Korean armistice, the heroic Korean people, under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, rebuilt their homeland on the ruins of war, and with selfless labor and a revolutionary spirit of creation, quickly restored the severe wounds of war. Last October, during a visit to Korea, I personally witnessed how the heroic and hardworking Korean people were full of vigor and high morale in building their country. Whether in cities, villages, schools, factories, or mines, everywhere gave a very deep impression.

    The heroic Korean people are truly riding the Chollima and are racing forward. The Chinese people are filled with incomparable joy and encouragement at the amazing achievements of Korea's high-speed construction.

    For the sake of peace in the Far East and the world, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took the initiative to withdraw from Korea nearly two years ago, while the American aggressor troops are still lingering in South Korea, doing all kinds of evil in South Korea. The people of South Korea live a dark and miserable life under the fascist rule of the reactionary traitorous group fostered by American imperialism. Standing on the Military Demarcation Line in Panmunjom, one can see that in the northern part of the Military Demarcation Line, people are working hard to build a happy homeland, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity. In South Korea, which is occupied by the American aggressor troops, there is desolation and bleakness everywhere. The disaster of the division of Korea is precisely the result of the war policy and aggression policy pursued by American imperialism. We firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be unified. The final victory will surely belong to the heroic Korean people.

    In recent months, the people of South Korea have held demonstrations everywhere to overthrow the bloody rule of the Syngman Rhee traitorous ruling group, and the flames of the anti-American struggle have spread throughout South Korea. Under the powerful blow of the large-scale patriotic and just struggle in South Korea, Syngman Rhee, the number one reactionary puppet and fascist dictator who had been fostered by American imperialism in South Korea for a long time, was overthrown. This is a great victory for the anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people. The Chinese people cheer for this brilliant victory achieved by the South Korean people.

    However, we must not forget in the slightest that the American aggressors are still stubbornly pursuing a policy of war. To this day, the American aggressor troops have not only not withdrawn from South Korea, but are also stepping up the transportation of new weapons into South Korea and establishing missile bases, while at the same time stepping up the support of the newly appointed Huh Jung reactionary government, actively preparing for war, attempting to permanently occupy South Korea, and using South Korea as a springboard for a new war in the Far East. At present, American imperialism is continuing to intensify the creation of tension in the Far East. Eisenhower's bandit trip to the Far East this time was intended to support and encourage the reactionaries of various countries, but he ran into obstacles everywhere and returned in disappointment. The situation is very good now. American imperialism and its running dogs are already surrounded by the people of the world. People clearly see that today's Far East is no longer the Far East where imperialism can do whatever it wants and run rampant, but the Far East where the people of various countries have risen up to drive away the American aggressors. As Chairman Mao said: "The life of the imperialists will not be long, because they do all kinds of bad things, specializing in supporting the anti-people reactionaries of various countries, occupying large numbers of colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases, and threatening peace with atomic war. In this way, they are forcing more than 90% of the people in the world to rise up and attack them." Imperialism cannot avoid the law of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, and finally perishing, and is destined for its fate of death.

    The great victory of the Chinese people in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea provides a good example for the people of the world to resolutely deal with imperialism. The combat friendship forged with blood by the Chinese and Korean people, who are as close as lips and teeth and share weal and woe, is unbreakable and evergreen. We firmly believe that the Korean people will surely be able to drive American imperialism out of South Korea and finally realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and must drive the American aggressors out of the Taiwan Strait. May we advance victoriously in the struggle against the common enemy, the American aggressors, and in defense of peace in the Far East and the world!

    向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬
    魏传统
    目前，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争正在汹涌澎湃的发展，在远东反对美帝国主义侵略保卫世界和平的正义斗争正如烈火燎原，已经成为一个不可抗拒的历史潮流。美帝国主义命运不长，前途暗淡。但是美国侵略者从没有接受历史的教训，仍与世界人民为敌。可以肯定，其结果只能是加速自己的早日灭亡。
    十年前的今天，美帝国主义挑起了侵略朝鲜的战争。美国侵略者气势汹汹，盗用联合国的招牌，纠集仆从，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了疯狂的进攻，越过“三八线”，直逼鸭绿江，彻底暴露了美帝国主义企图侵略中国，霸占和奴役亚洲及全世界人民的野心，激起了中朝人民和全世界人民的极大的愤怒。朝鲜人民为了捍卫自己祖国的独立和荣誉，毅然起而自卫。中国人民为了援助我们亲密的邻邦，保卫祖国的安全和建设，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并组织了中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，抗击美帝国主义。经过三年多的英勇战斗，迫使美国侵略者不得不接受谈判停战。由于正义在我们这一方面，因此朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军终于在劣势装备条件下，战胜了号称天字第一号的美国“纸老虎”，大大鼓舞了全世界人民反帝斗争的决心和信心。从而打乱了美国强盗企图奴役全世界人民的罪恶计划。
    中朝两国人民携手并肩反对美帝国主义侵略斗争的伟大胜利，这一事实，雄辩地证明了美帝国主义和一切反动派都是外强中干的纸老虎。同时也向全世界人民揭示了这样一个真理：觉醒了的人民，是不可欺侮和不可战胜的。
    朝鲜停战后，英雄的朝鲜人民在劳动党和金日成首相的英明领导下，在战争的废墟上重建家园，用忘我的劳动和革命的创造精神，迅速恢复了严重的战争创伤。去年10月，在朝鲜访问期间，我曾亲眼看到了英勇勤劳的朝鲜人民是如何意气风发，斗志昂扬地建设着自己的祖国。无论在城市、农村、学校、工厂和矿山，到处都给人以极其深刻的印象。
    英雄的朝鲜人民，真是跨上了千里马，正在飞驰前进。中国人民对朝鲜高速度建设的惊人成就感到无比的欢欣和鼓舞。
    为了远东和世界和平，中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜将近两年，而美国侵略军仍赖在南朝鲜不走，并在南朝鲜做尽了一切坏事。南朝鲜人民在美帝国主义所豢养的反动卖国集团的法西斯统治下，过着暗无天日的悲惨生活。站在板门店军事分界线上即可看到：在军事分界线的北部，人们正在辛勤地建设着幸福的家园，到处是一片欣欣向荣的景象。而在美国侵略军占领的南朝鲜，那边则是一片荒芜，满目凄凉。造成朝鲜南北分裂的灾难，这正是美帝国主义所奉行的战争政策和侵略政策的结果。我们坚决支持朝鲜人民进行和平统一祖国的正义斗争。朝鲜三千里锦绣江山，必将获得统一。最后的胜利必将属于英雄的朝鲜人民。
    近数月来，南朝鲜人民为了推翻李承晚卖国统治集团的血腥统治，到处举行示威游行，反美斗争的烈火已经燃遍了整个南朝鲜。在南朝鲜声势浩大的爱国正义斗争的有力打击之下，把美帝国主义在南朝鲜所长期扶植的第一号反动傀儡和法西斯独裁统治者李承晚赶下了台。这是南朝鲜人民反美爱国正义斗争的巨大胜利。中国人民为南朝鲜人民所取得的这一光辉胜利而欢呼。
    但是，我们丝毫也不能忘记，美国侵略者仍在顽固地执行战争政策，至今美国侵略军不但没有撤出南朝鲜，而且正在一面加紧向南朝鲜运入新式武器，建立导弹基地，一面加紧扶植新上台的许政反动政府，积极备战，企图永久占领南朝鲜，并利用南朝鲜作为它在远东进行新战争的跳板。目前美帝国主义正在继续加紧在远东制造紧张局势。这次艾森豪威尔在远东的强盗旅行，本想给各国反动派撑腰、打气，结果到处碰壁，败兴而归。现在形势很好，美帝国主义及其走狗已经处于世界人民的四面包围之中。人们清楚地看到，今天的远东再不是帝国主义可以为所欲为横行霸道的远东，而是远东各国人民起来赶走美国侵略者的远东了。正如毛主席所说：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样他们就迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。”帝国主义避免不了由捣乱、失败，再捣乱、再失败以至最后灭亡的法则，而注定了它们死亡的命运。
    中国人民抗美援朝的伟大胜利给全世界人民提供了坚决对付帝国主义的良好范例。唇齿相依患难与共的中朝两国人民用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊是牢不可破和万古长青的。我们深信：朝鲜人民一定能够把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，最后实现祖国的和平统一。中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要把美国侵略者从台湾海峡赶出去。愿我们在反对共同的敌人美国侵略者、保卫远东和世界和平的斗争中胜利前进！
