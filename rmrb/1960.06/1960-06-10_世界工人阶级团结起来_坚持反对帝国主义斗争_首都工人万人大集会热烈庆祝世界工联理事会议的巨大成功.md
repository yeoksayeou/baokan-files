Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Over ten thousand workers in Beijing held a grand rally tonight, warmly welcoming delegates from various countries attending the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and warmly celebrating the tremendous success of this council meeting filled with the fighting will against imperialism.

This was a grand gathering of worker brothers from various countries. The solemn Great Hall of the People was filled with the warm atmosphere of the international working class's fighting solidarity and fraternal friendship. Today, the rostrum in the Great Hall was covered with blooming flowers and evergreen palms. In the center of the rostrum hung a huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, flanked by ten huge red flags. Opposite the rostrum hung a gold-lettered red banner in Chinese and French: "Workers of All Countries, Unite! Oppressed Nations of All Countries, Unite! Down with Imperialism Headed by the United States! Strive for the Complete Liberation of the Proletariat and Oppressed Nations!" This powerful fighting slogan was also the fighting voice expressed in the resolution passed by the Council today.

At 7:30 PM, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, Liu Lantao, alternate member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and others accompanied World Federation of Trade Unions President Novella (Italy), Vice-Presidents Grishin (Soviet Union), Frachon (France), Toledano (Mexico), Warnke (German Democratic Republic), Dange (India), Šupka (Czechoslovakia), Loga-Sowiński (Poland), and Pastorino (Uruguay) onto the rostrum. Other foreign guests on the rostrum included World Federation of Trade Unions Secretariat Secretaries Grassi (Italy), Berezin (Soviet Union), Teodorescu (Romania), Buhl (France), Sugili (Indonesia), and Zakaria (Sudan), as well as members of the Executive Committee, Council members, alternate members, and specially invited representatives of trade unions from various countries. At this moment, welcoming music was played in the Great Hall of the People, and thunderous applause erupted. All the workers in the capital stood up and extended brotherly respect and congratulations to the trade union representatives from all five continents with warm applause full of friendship.

The celebration rally began with the solemn Chinese national anthem. Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Beijing workers, extended the warmest welcome to the trade union representatives from various countries and sincerely congratulated the successful conclusion of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting. He said that this meeting condemned imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States, supported the just struggles of workers and people in Algeria, Cuba, Japan, South Korea, and other countries, and called on the international working class to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle against imperialism and for the defense of world peace. The Beijing workers fully support this. He said, we believe that this meeting will play a positive role in strengthening the unity of the world's working class and promoting the struggle of workers in all countries against imperialism and for the maintenance of world peace.

Wang Jiong said that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and cunning enemy of world peace. Its nature of aggression and war cannot be changed. The sweet talk of imperialism can never be believed. We must maintain high vigilance, mobilize the broadest masses of the people, and persevere in the struggle to the end. He also said that modern revisionists represented by the Tito group have put lipstick on U.S. imperialism and played the shameful role of traitors to the working class and running dogs of imperialism. We must thoroughly expose their traitorous faces, completely eliminate the ideological toxins they spread, and thoroughly smash their sabotage activities.

Wang Jiong concluded by saying that we are currently in a great era where "the East wind prevails over the West wind." Let us unite and concentrate all our strength to defeat the forces of war and aggression headed by U.S. imperialism, and bravely advance on the victorious road of striving for lasting world peace and the cause of human progress.

World Federation of Trade Unions President Novella was invited to speak at the meeting. Novella first expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese trade unions, and all the Chinese workers, especially the workers and people of Beijing, for the help they had given to the work of the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

He said that we come from all over the world, from all continents, in order to discuss with you in Beijing the common problems of the world proletariat: dealing with the war threat of imperialism and achieving peace through struggle, the liberation and national independence of all countries, striving for democratic progress, and the liberation of all workers from capitalist exploitation.

He said that the problems of various countries are different in practice, and the historical and political conditions for the struggle of the people of various countries are different. But the goals, principles, and will of the struggle are common.

He condemned U.S. imperialism for taking a series of aggressive and provocative actions, which culminated in the U-2 spy plane's violation of Soviet sovereignty. Through these aggressive and provocative activities, U.S. imperialism made the Paris Conference impossible and once again violated the hopes of the people of all countries in the world for peace.

He said that the unity of the proletariats of all countries, its combat and struggle, the growing superiority of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union in science, economy, society, and military affairs, and the great progress made by the people of all countries in the struggle for national independence and liberation from imperialist and colonialist exploitation, constitute a vast camp of peace and solidarity action, which is enough to force the end of the Cold War and the failure of imperialist attempts.

Novella pointed out that imperialists will not give us disarmament, relaxation of the international situation, peace, and social progress as if they were gifts, but the working class and the people have the power to ensure that these achievements are made in the world.

He finally shouted amidst the storm of applause from the audience: "Long live proletarian internationalism!"

World Federation of Trade Unions Vice-President and Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Grishin pointed out in his speech that the work of this Council Meeting was carried out under the banner of strengthening the struggle of trade unions and working people around the world against the aggressive conspiracies of imperialists and striving to safeguard the peace and security of all nations. This meeting, like all progressive humanity in the world, denounced imperialism, especially the ruling groups of the United States. The participants in the meeting once again expressed the anger of all nations against the criminal actions of the U.S. government, which declared sending military aircraft to conduct spy flights over Soviet territory as its own policy, it undermined the summit meeting, and is reviving German and Japanese militarism, playing the shameful role of a gendarme strangling the freedom of all nations.

Grishin pointed out that the great socialist camp is the most important guarantee of world peace. The socialist camp, in the common efforts with all peace-loving people, trade unions, and the working class in capitalist and colonial countries, will restrain any aggressor and stop any conspiracy by the imperialist war provocateurs. The socialist camp is growing stronger day by day. The power of the Soviet Union is growing, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture are developing rapidly, and the Soviet Union has made great achievements in the development of science and technology. The great Chinese people have made great achievements in their country's economy and culture due to the implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's general line of continuing the Great Leap Forward and developing people's communes. The development of industry, agriculture, and culture in all socialist countries is on the rise.

Grishin emphasized that as long as imperialism exists, imperialism will still threaten the tranquility of all nations, will still formulate criminal plans to launch new wars, and will try to maintain its rule in capitalist and colonial countries in order to exploit and plunder the working people and make a fortune with the super profits earned by the blood and sweat of the people of all nations.

He said that under these conditions, the task of all honest people, all working people, and trade unions is to more closely unite the forces fighting for peace, expose the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, oppose aggressive blocs and military bases in other countries' territories, and support the sincere peace policy of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

He finally shouted: Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and the people of all socialist countries.

Representative of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Seiichi Suzuki, said in his speech that the 11th World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting decided on very clear struggle methods and goals in a friendly atmosphere. This is an exciting thing. This will greatly encourage the Japanese workers and people who are engaged in fierce struggles.

He said that the Japanese workers and people will organize a twenty-four-hour general strike on June 15. This general strike will greatly exceed the action on June 4. From the day before Eisenhower's visit to Japan to the day of the visit, 200,000 people in Tokyo will hold demonstrations and large-scale protest rallies will be held throughout the country.

Seiichi Suzuki said that the World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting passed a resolution supporting our struggle and developing this struggle to the international scope. In order to further strengthen the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to win the victory of the "Mitsui Miike Struggle," many encouraging telegrams were sent to the General Council's Extraordinary Congress, which opened yesterday at the Miike site. On behalf of the 3.6 million General Council members, he expressed his deep gratitude. Seiichi Suzuki finally shouted: "Long live the Great Leap Forward in China!" "Long live the unity of the world's workers!"

World Federation of Trade Unions Vice-President and General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor Frachon pointed out in his speech that an important task that must be completed in the current situation is to strive to unite all workers' forces in the world to deal with the provocations of imperialist forces against establishing a solid and lasting peace.

Frachon said that U.S. imperialists are disturbed by the development of the forces of world peace, and they have carried out the most barbaric and the most brutal provocations in an attempt to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation and to cause the failure of the summit meeting. In this provocative action, U.S. imperialism was supported by the most reactionary forces of various capitalist countries. However, their provocations and treacherous conspiracies cannot prevent the growth and strength of the forces of peace that oppose their criminal activities.

Frachon emphasized that we workers, completely recognize the face of imperialism. We deal with them in all aspects of our daily lives. We have never expected their goodwill. Therefore, in its fierce struggle to support peace and disarmament, the World Federation of Trade Unions demands that workers remain vigilant and combative. Today, this intervention and action by the working class is more necessary than ever before.

Frachon pointed out that the unity of the world's working class represents a force that no imperialist force can successfully resist. The World Federation of Trade Unions should focus its activities and forces on this unity. In the struggle for peace and disarmament, the unity of defending the workers' own interests and striving for freedom and independence is possible and necessary. We should realize this unity with the greatest importance.

World Federation of Trade Unions Vice-President and President of the Latin American Labor Confederation Toledano emphasized at the meeting that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the people of all countries. Twenty countries in Latin America have now begun a revolutionary upsurge in the struggle for economic independence. The working class of Latin America is leading all democratic strata to fight for the liberation of their countries from the clutches of U.S. imperialism.

He said with victorious confidence that the current struggle has more favorable conditions than yesterday, because the people of Latin America are joining with the oppressed people of the world to oppose imperialism. A liberation army composed of the people of Latin America, Africa, and Asia, accounting for one-half of the world's population, has been established. Today, Latin America is no longer the reserve force of imperialism, but the force of the world proletarian revolution.

Toledano's words aroused a storm of applause from the audience.

Representative of the Cuban trade unions from the front line of the anti-U.S. imperialist struggle and Propaganda Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Federation, de la Aguilera, said in his speech that U.S. imperialism has never stopped its aggression against Cuba. However, like the great Chinese people, the Cuban people have made the greatest efforts to completely liberate themselves from the shackles of imperialism.

He said that the Cuban people will firmly fight to achieve political and economic independence and to become a prosperous and happy country. The aggression of U.S. imperialism cannot scare us. If U.S. imperialism dares to carry out military aggression against us, then the answer it will receive is: "We will defend our motherland to the death."

He said that our struggle has received the support of the people of the world. The Cuban people attach great importance to the support given by the Chinese people. If the Chinese people, the Cuban people, and the people of the world unite, they can completely defeat the imperialist forces.

World Federation of Trade Unions Secretariat Secretary and Sudanese trade union representative Zakaria said excitedly in his speech that tonight's meeting will be etched in his mind forever. He said that the Sudanese workers have deep respect for the Chinese people's strong will and determination to build China into a strong socialist country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, and expressed the greatest gratitude for the Chinese people's support for the African people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.

He said that the great support of the Chinese people for the people of Algeria, the Congo, South Africa, and other regions of Africa has shaken the foundation of imperialism, especially the foundation of U.S. imperialism. It has inspired the struggle of the African people. Africa has stood up, and a storm has appeared in front of imperialism. Nothing will be able to prevent the death of imperialism.

General Secretary of the Australian Building Workers' Industrial Union, F. Purse, said that the great progress made by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in all aspects of human endeavor is an endless source of inspiration for workers in Australia and other countries. He said that at this World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting, it was extremely encouraging to hear about the glorious and heroic struggles of workers against monopoly capitalism and for national liberation and independence. He said that representative after representative at this meeting reported on the struggles of the people of Africa, Latin America, and Asia to liberate themselves from the shackles of colonialism and to determine their own future in politics and economics.

F. Purse said that these reports show that in the face of the people's growing determination, the life of imperialism will not be long.

Speaking of the persecution of the Australian working class by monopoly capital and imperialism, he said that the workers of Australia understand that the road to progress lies in the unity of workers around the world in the struggle to build a new and better world, a world without disasters and poverty, a world without oppression and fear, and a world without war. Our task is to further advance the struggle for these noble goals, and the greatest inspiration in this regard is the achievements of the workers in socialist countries.

Finally, he said that the Australian workers welcome the decisions made by the World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting, as well as the plan to mobilize workers around the world to isolate and defeat imperialism and win world peace.

The speeches of the trade union representatives from various countries were warmly welcomed by the workers, and enthusiastic storms of applause constantly resounded in the meeting place.

After the foreign guests spoke, Wang Jiong expressed his gratitude to the foreign guests. At this time, a group of Young Pioneers, holding flags, lined up and went onto the rostrum. The children sent representatives to make speeches, congratulating the workers uncles and aunts from various countries on the achievements of the meeting. In the long and warm applause of the audience, the foreign guests accepted the flowers presented by the children, and the Great Hall was immediately immersed in an atmosphere of joy and friendship.

When the celebration rally ended, the band played the Internationale. At this time, the representatives of the trade unions from various countries could not help but sing this song that inspires the liberation struggle of workers around the world in various languages.

Also attending today's celebration rally were Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Changsheng, Zhu Xuefan, and Li Jiebo, Secretariat Secretaries Li Zaiwen and Kang Yonghe, and heads of various industrial trade unions, Secretaries of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC Wan Li and Chen Kehan, Vice-Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Peng Siming, and heads of various industrial trade unions in Beijing.

After the celebration rally, the foreign guests and the Beijing workers held a get-together in the various halls of the Great Hall of the People and watched various wonderful programs. (Attached picture)

    世界工人阶级团结起来  坚持反对帝国主义斗争
    首都工人万人大集会热烈庆祝世界工联理事会议的巨大成功
    新华社9日讯　北京一万多工人今晚举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎参加世界工联理事会第十一次会议的各国代表，热烈庆祝这次充满反对帝国主义战斗意志的理事会会议的巨大成功。
   这是各国工人兄弟的一次盛大集会，庄严的人民大会堂里充满了国际工人阶级战斗的团结和兄弟友谊的热烈气氛。今天，大会堂主席台上布满了盛开的鲜花和常青的棕榈。主席台正中高悬着中国工人阶级和中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的巨幅画像，两旁树立着十面巨大的红旗。主席台对面挂着金字红底的中文和法文标语：“全世界工人阶级团结起来，全世界被压迫民族团结起来，打倒以美国为首的帝国主义，为无产阶级和被压迫民族的彻底解放而奋斗！”这个强烈的战斗的口号，也是今天理事会通过的决议中所表达出的战斗的声音。
    七时半，中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记彭真，中共中央书记处候补书记刘澜涛，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，北京市总工会主席王炯等陪同世界工联主席诺维拉（意大利），副主席格里申（苏联）、弗拉商（法国）、托列达诺（墨西哥）、瓦恩克（德意志民主共和国）、丹吉（印度）、苏普卡（捷克斯洛伐克）、洛加—索文斯基（波兰）、巴斯多利诺（乌拉圭）等登上主席台。登上主席台的外宾还有世界工联书记处书记葛拉西（意大利）、别列金（苏联）、戴奥多里斯古（罗马尼亚）、布拉（法国）、苏吉利（印度尼西亚）、札卡里亚（苏丹），以及执行委员会，理事会理事、候补理事，各国工会的特邀代表等。这时人民大会堂里奏起了欢迎的乐曲和响起了暴风雨般的掌声。到会的首都工人们全体起立，用充满友情的热烈掌声，向来自五大洲的世界各国工会代表们致以兄弟般的敬意和祝贺。
    庆祝大会在庄严的中国国歌声中开始。北京市总工会主席王烱代表北京市职工向各国的工会代表表示最热烈的欢迎，并且衷心祝贺世界工联理事会会议的胜利闭幕。他说，这次会议谴责了以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义，声援了阿尔及利亚、古巴、日本、南朝鲜等国家的工人和人民的正义斗争，号召国际工人阶级加强团结，坚持反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争，北京工人们对此表示完全拥护。他说，我们相信，这次会议对于加强全世界工人阶级的团结，推动各国工人阶级反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的斗争，必将发生积极的作用。
    王烱说，美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶最狡猾的敌人。它的侵略和战争本性是不可能改变的。帝国主义的甜言蜜语，是永远相信不得的，我们必须保持高度的警惕，动员最广大的人民群众，坚持不懈地斗争到底。他还说，以铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者为美帝国主义擦脂抹粉，扮演了工人阶级叛徒和帝国主义走狗的可耻角色，我们必须彻底揭穿他们的叛徒面目，彻底消除他们散布的思想毒素，彻底粉碎他们的破坏活动。
    王烱最后说，当前我们正处在“东风压倒西风”的大好时代，让我们团结起来，集中一切力量击败以美帝国主义为首的战争侵略势力，在争取世界持久和平和人类进步事业的胜利大道上奋勇前进。
    世界工联主席诺维拉应邀在会上讲话。诺维拉首先向中国政府、中国工会、全体中国工人特别是北京市的工人和人民表示感谢，感谢他们对世界工联理事会第十一次会议的工作所给予的帮助。
    他说，我们来自世界各地，来自各大洲，以便同你们一起在北京讨论世界无产阶级的共同问题：对付帝国主义的战争威胁并通过斗争来获得和平，各国人民的解放和民族独立，争取民主的进展，和全体工人从资本主义剥削下获得解放。
    他说，各国的问题在实践中是不同的，各国人民进行斗争的历史政治条件是不同的。但是斗争的目标，原则和意志是共同的。
    他谴责美帝国主义采取一系列的侵略性和挑衅性的活动，这些活动由U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联主权而达到最高峰。美帝国主义通过这些侵略性和挑衅性的活动，使巴黎会议成为不可能，并再一次违背了世界各国人民对和平的希望。
    他说，各国无产阶级的团结，它的战斗和斗争，以苏联为首的社会主义各国在科学、经济、社会、军事方面的日益增长的优越性，各国人民在争取民族独立、争取从帝国主义和殖民主义剥削下解放出来的斗争中所取得的巨大进展，构成了一个广大的和平团结行动的阵营，这个阵营足以迫使冷战结束和帝国主义企图遭到失败。
    诺维拉指出，帝国主义者是不会像送礼物那样把裁军、国际局势的缓和、和平及社会进步送给我们的，但是工人阶级和人民有力量保证在世界上取得这些成果。
    他最后在全场暴风雨般的掌声中高呼：“无产阶级国际主义万岁！”
    世界工联副主席、全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在讲话中指出，这次理事会会议的工作，是在加强全世界工会和劳动人民反对帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，争取保障各族人民的和平和安全的斗争的标志下进行的。这次会议，像全世界进步人类一样，痛斥了帝国主义，特别是美国的统治集团。会议的参加者再一次表达了各族人民反对美国政府犯罪行为的愤怒心情，美国政府把派军用飞机到苏联领土上空进行间谍飞行宣布为自己的政策，它破坏了最高级会议，正在复活德国和日本的军国主义，扮演着扼杀各族人民自由的可耻的宪兵角色。
    格里申指出，伟大的社会主义阵营是世界和平的最重要保障。社会主义阵营在与资本主义和殖民地各国一切爱好和平的人民、工会和工人阶级的共同努力下，将束缚住任何侵略者，制止帝国主义战争挑拨者的任何阴谋。社会主义阵营正在日益加强。苏联的威力正在增长，苏联的工农业正在迅速的发展，苏联在发展科学和技术方面取得了巨大的成就。伟大的中国人民由于实现中国共产党的继续大跃进和发展人民公社的总路线，在本国的经济和文化方面取得了巨大的成就。所有社会主义国家的工农业和文化的发展正处于高涨中。
    格里申强调指出，只要帝国主义还存在，帝国主义仍将威胁各族人民的安宁，仍将制订发动新战争的罪恶计划，力图保持自己在资本主义和殖民地各国的统治，以便剥削和掠夺劳动人民，以各族人民的血汗所获得的超额利润来大发其财。
    他说，在这种条件下，一切诚实的人们，一切劳动人民和工会的任务是更紧密的团结为和平而斗争的力量，揭露帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，反对侵略集团和在别国领土上的军事基地，支持苏联和一切社会主义国家的真诚和平的政策。
    他最后高呼：中苏两国人民，社会主义各国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁。
    日本工会总评议会代表铃木诚市在讲话中说，第十一次世界工联理事会会议在友好的气氛中，决定了极为明确的斗争方法和目标。这是令人兴奋的事情。这将大大地鼓舞正在进行激烈斗争的日本工人和人民。
    他说，日本的工人和人民，将于6月15日组织二十四小时的总罢工。这次总罢工将大大超过6月4日的行动。从艾森豪威尔访问日本的前一天到当天，东京将有二十万人举行游行示威，全国各地将举行大规模的抗议集会。
    铃木诚市说，世界工联理事会会议通过了支持我们斗争、并使这个斗争朝向国际范围发展的决议。各国工会为了进一步加强反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，使“三井三池斗争”获得胜利，向从昨天在三池现场开幕的总评临时大会拍去了许多鼓励的电报。他代表三百六十万总评工会会员对此表示深深的谢意。铃木诚市最后高呼：“中国大跃进万岁！”“世界工人团结万岁！”
    世界工联副主席、法国总工会总书记弗拉商在讲话中首先指出，在目前的形势下，一项必须完成的重要任务是：努力团结全世界一切工人力量，对付反对建立巩固持久和平的帝国主义力量的挑衅。
    弗拉商说，美帝国主义者对世界和平力量的发展感到不安，它们进行了最野蛮的最粗暴的挑衅，企图阻挠国际局势的缓和以及使最高级会议失败，在这一挑衅行动中，美帝国主义受到了各资本主义国家最反动力量的支持。然而它们的挑衅和背信弃义的勾当，并不能阻止反对它们罪恶活动的和平力量成长壮大，而是和平力量越战越强。
    弗拉商强调说，我们工人阶级战士们，完全认识帝国主义的面貌，我们在每天的生活中各方面都跟他们打交道，我们从未期待他们的善意。因此世界工联在它的支持和平和裁军的激烈斗争中，要求工人保持警惕性和战斗性。今天，工人阶级的这种干预和行动比以前任何时期更为必要了。
    弗拉商指出，全世界工人阶级团结起来，就代表着一种任何帝国主义力量不能顺利地抗拒的力量。世界工联就是应该在这种团结上集中它的活动和力量。在争取和平的斗争中、裁军中保卫工人切身利益和争取自由和独立的团结是可能的而且是必要的，我们应该以最大的重视实现这种团结。
    世界工联副主席、拉丁美洲劳联主席托列达诺在会上强调说，美帝国主义是各国人民主要的敌人。拉丁美洲二十个国家现在开始了争取经济独立的革命高潮。拉丁美洲的工人阶级正在领导各民主阶层为从美帝国主义的魔爪下解放他们的国家而斗争。
    他满怀胜利信心地说，现在的斗争比昨天更具备了有利的条件，因为拉丁美洲人民正和全世界被压迫的人民一起来反对帝国主义。由拉丁美洲、非洲、亚洲人民组成的占世界人口二分之一的一支解放大军已经建立起来。今天，拉丁美洲已经不是帝国主义的后备军，而是世界无产阶级革命的力量。
    托列达诺的这些话，在全场激起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    来自反美帝国主义斗争前线的古巴工会的代表、古巴工人联合会宣传书记德拉阿基莱拉在讲话中说，美帝国主义一刻也没有停止过对古巴的侵略。但是，就像伟大的中国人民一样，古巴人民作了最大的努力，以便彻底从帝国主义的束缚下解放出来。
    他说，古巴人民将坚定地为争取政治、经济的独立，争取成为一个富强幸福的国家而斗争。美帝国主义的侵略吓不倒我们。美帝国主义如果胆敢对我们进行军事侵略，那末它得到的回答就是：“我们要誓死保卫祖国”。
    他说，我们的斗争得到了全世界人民的支持。古巴人民对中国人民所给予的支持非常重视。中国人民、古巴人民和全世界人民团结起来，就可以彻底击败帝国主义势力。
    世界工联书记处书记、苏丹工会代表扎卡里亚在讲话中激动地表示，今天晚上的大会将使他永志心头。他说苏丹工人对中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下把中国建设成一个强大社会主义国家的坚强意志和决心，怀着深深的敬意，对于中国人民给予非洲人民反帝反殖民主义斗争的支援，表示最大的感激。
    他说，中国人民对阿尔及利亚、刚果、南非以及非洲其它地区人民的伟大支援，动摇了帝国主义的基础，特别是美帝国主义的基础。鼓舞了非洲人民的斗争。非洲已经站起来了，帝国主义面前出现了暴风雨，任何东西也将无法阻止帝国主义的死亡。
    澳大利亚建筑工人产业工会总书记弗·珀斯说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在人类努力的各个方面取得的伟大进展，是鼓舞澳大利亚和其他国家工人的无尽泉源。他说，在这次世界工联理事会会议上，极为令人鼓舞的是听到了工人们为反对垄断资本主义和争取民族解放和独立而进行的光荣的和英勇的斗争。他说，代表一个接着一个地在这次会议上报告了非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲各国人民为争取把自己从殖民主义枷锁下解放出来并在政治和经济方面决定自己的前途而进行的斗争。
    弗·珀斯说，这些报告表明，在人民不断增长的决心面前，帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。
    他在谈到垄断资本和帝国主义对澳大利亚工人阶级的迫害时说，澳大利亚的工人了解到：向前迈进的道路，是在于全世界工人在斗争中的团结，这个斗争是为了建设一个新的、更好的世界，一个没有灾难和贫困的世界，一个没有压迫和恐惧的世界，一个没有战争的世界。我们的任务是进一步推进争取这些崇高的目的而斗争，在这方面最大的鼓舞就是社会主义国家工人的成就。
    最后他表示澳大利亚工人欢迎世界工联理事会会议所做出的决定，以及为了孤立和击败帝国主义赢得世界和平而制定的动员全世界工人的计划。
    各国工会代表的讲话，受到工人们热烈的欢迎，会场上不断响起热烈的狂风暴雨般的掌声。
    外宾讲话以后，王烱向外宾们表示感谢。这时一群少先队员举着旗帜列队登上主席台，孩子们派出代表致词，向各国的工人叔叔伯伯们祝贺会议的成就。在全场长时间的热烈掌声中，外宾们接受了孩子们献给的鲜花，大会堂里立即沉浸在一片欢乐友谊的气氛中。
    当庆祝大会结束时，乐队奏起了国际歌，这时，各国工会的代表们也情不自禁地随着乐声用各种语言唱起了这支鼓舞全世界工人解放斗争的歌曲。
    出席今天庆祝大会的还有中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜、朱学范、李颉伯，书记处书记栗再温、康永和和各产业工会负责人，中共北京市委书记万里、陈克寒，北京市总工会副主席彭思明和北京市各产业工会负责人等。
    庆祝大会结束后，外宾们同北京工人在人民大会堂的各个大厅里一起举行了联欢，观看了各种精采的节目。（附图片）
