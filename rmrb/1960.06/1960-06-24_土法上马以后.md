After Indigenous Methods Go Into Action
Inner Mongolia Daily Reporter He Wanbo

Not far from the large open-hearth furnace and large blast furnace, there is a comprehensive utilization workshop. Stepping into the workshop, the first thing that catches the eye is the piles of waste materials, simple and low-rise factory buildings, makeshift indigenous machines, small kilns, and small furnaces... Some say this is a "poor courtyard." But the courtyard has endless miracles to tell.

This is the workshop of the prefabrication plant of Baotou Steel Production Enterprise Company. Here, daring and capable people are using seemingly simple equipment to manufacture useful products. Through their hands, blast furnace slag is turned into insulation material, broken wood into fiberboard, waste steel plate edges into steel bars, and wood chips into alcohol... Seeing these things, people realize that this "poor courtyard" is actually the richest. The products produced here are all used in the construction of Baotou Steel.

Is it a Leg, or a Tail?

It is said that the comprehensive utilization workshop was one of the earliest to adopt indigenous methods at Baotou Steel. But whether it was helpful or obstructive, it has been the subject of much discussion since its establishment.

Those who liked it said it was a leg, believing that to build Baotou Steel quickly, well, and economically, there should be both foreign and indigenous methods, walking on two legs. Others who disliked it said it was an indigenous tail, advocating simply cutting it off with one knife. Their reason was that since Baotou Steel could be called a modern large enterprise, the equipment should all be "large" and "foreign." Isn't it too unsightly to drag along such an indigenous tail? ...

It is conceivable that in such a debate, the growth of the comprehensive utilization workshop would not be smooth sailing. In the beginning, there were only eighteen comrades in the workshop, all of whom were engaged in construction and were laymen in production. When they accepted the task of self-reliantly producing materials, they were faced with a pile of difficulties: no raw materials, lack of equipment, and the products to be manufactured were urgently needed by the construction site, with a tight deadline. But they said that there were no difficulties that workers could not overcome, and the situation required starting with indigenous methods. So, they really took their indigenous "leg" and quickly embarked on the road of comprehensive utilization.

Initially, they found materials from the waste pile, built the first indigenous electric furnace, repaired a welding box, and collected leftover coke and small limestone pieces from the steel plant. In a few days, they produced calcium carbide and welding rods. Immediately afterwards, they produced several new products. In this way, the idea of comprehensive utilization began to sprout in the workshop. But some people shook their heads when they saw the products made by indigenous methods. One day, a comrade said to workshop director Bian Qingbo:

"Old Bian, this is really nonsense. How did the enterprise company open a grocery store?"
"The construction site needs these things!"
"We have to do some calculations," the comrade said. "I'm sure the cost is high and the quality is low. It's not worth it..."

At that time, the "indigenous" vs. "foreign" debate was fierce, and the focus of the debate was on this workshop. This affected Lao Bian and his partners, who couldn't help but hesitate. If they disbanded, it would affect the progress of the project; if they didn't disband, some people were advising them to stop working. Just when they were in a dilemma, the Party organization came forward to support them. The Party Secretary told Bian Qingbo, "Comprehensive utilization is the path pointed out to us by Chairman Mao. We are doing the right thing and must persevere!" In this way, the workers' hearts were brightened.

Everyone Works, Everyone Thinks

As a result, some looked for raw materials, some studied theory, and some built equipment. A storm of vigorously engaging in diversified operations, comprehensive utilization, and vigorously carrying out technical revolution quickly swept through the entire workshop.

The prefabrication plant urgently needed calcium chloride. Workshop director Bian worked with a young plasterer to experiment. They were dizzy, nauseous, and even fainted, but they persisted in the experiment. Finally, they succeeded in trial production. But no one had ever seen how it was produced. They sent people to visit and study at the Tianjin Chemical Plant. When they saw it, the production equipment there was all "foreign." One electrolytic cell was as big as a room; and after inquiring, the equipment could not be ordered for a while, and it would take one or two years to train the technical workers to operate such equipment. "Foreign" equipment could not be counted on for the time being. What to do? Use indigenous methods. From the day of the visit, these people had been pondering, and after much painstaking effort, they finally figured out a set of indigenous equipment drawings based on "foreign" principles, except for the electrolytic cell, which was difficult to solve.

Returning from the chemical plant at night, they were lying in the hotel bed, still discussing countermeasures. Old cement worker Xia Mengchen had paid special attention to the electrolytic cell during the day. At this moment, he thought: the electrolytic cell is made of ceramic... He suddenly shouted: "I've got it!" He told Bian Qingbo, "The electrolytic cell can be solved. Use a water tank!" Bian Qingbo and he excitedly turned on the light and, in the light of the late night, designed the last piece of equipment: drill a hole in the bottom of the water tank, seal the top, and put the electrolytic plates inside - this was their electrolytic cell.

The new product was quickly put into production. Calcium chloride was sent to the most needed construction site.

During this period, indigenous methods also blossomed on that small electric furnace. In addition to refining calcium carbide and welding rods, someone refined ferromanganese, and someone refined carborundum and mineral wool...

This Road is the Right One

The comprehensive utilization workshop is developing vigorously. The new products it trial-produces are as bright and dazzling as flowers that never fade. In the red May, the company sent technicians to improve comprehensive utilization and specially formed a building science research office. Bian Qingbo and his partners are also researchers at this institution. Their workshop has increased to more than one hundred people, and many family members have also joined the workshop to produce.

The newly arrived technicians put their laboratory in the workshop. They worked with the workers, experimenting and laboring together. When a product was successfully tested, the workers had already mastered the technology and immediately put it into mass production.

Looking at this situation, the "indigenous leg" can also walk as fast as flying. People who originally wanted to cut off the "indigenous tail" are now also accustomed to using this "indigenous leg" to walk.

People who come to Baotou Steel to visit, after seeing the large open-hearth furnace and large blast furnace, always take the opportunity to visit this workshop. The common feeling is: indigenous methods are useful, and it is good to take the road of comprehensive utilization.

The early summer sun shines into the building science laboratory. On the laboratory table is a newly printed comprehensive utilization plan. The variety of plans is astonishing. And this plan is being realized in this bustling workshop. The technicians and workers here have a common wish and happiness. This wish overflows from a clapper talk jointly compiled by them: What the construction site needs, we produce. Indigenous methods are put into action, and the more we do, the more energetic we become.

    土法上马以后
    内蒙古日报记者　何万波
    离大平炉、大高炉不远的地方有个综合利用工段，跨进工段大门，首先映入眼帘的是那左一堆、右一堆的废料，简陋、低矮的厂房，搭成伙的土机器，小窑灶，小炉子……有人说这是一家“穷大院”。但院里却有着述说不完的奇迹。
    这是包钢生产企业公司预制厂的工段。在这儿，敢想敢干的人们正靠那看来简易的设备制造着有用的产品。经过他们的手，高炉矿渣变成了保温材料，破烂木头变成了纤维板，废钢板边制成了钢筋，木屑造出了酒精……看到这些，人们才知道这“穷大院”却是最富有的。这里生产的产品，都用在包钢建设上了。
  是腿，还是尾巴
    听说，包钢土法上马较早的要属这个综合利用工段了。但不知是因为顶事还是碍眼，从成立那天起就引得人们议论纷纷。
    喜欢它的人说这是一条腿，认为要多、快、好、省地建设包钢，有洋就得有土，洋土结合，两条腿走路。另外一些嫌弃它的人，说这是土尾巴，主张干脆一刀割断。他们的理由是，包钢既然称得上是现代化大企业，设备也都该是“大”，“洋”的，拖上这样个土尾巴，不是太难看了吗？……
    可以想像，在这样争论里，综合利用工段的成长不会是一帆风顺的。开头，段里仅有十八个同志，都是搞建筑的，对搞生产是外行。当他们接受了任务，自力更生来生产材料的时候，眼前还明摆着一大堆困难：原料没有，设备缺乏，要造的产品又是工地急需的，期限很紧。但他们说，工人面前没有克服不了的困难，形势要求从土法入门。于是，他们真就迈开土“腿”，快步走上了综合利用的路。
    最初，他们由废料堆里找来材料，搭起第一座土电炉，修上电焊箱，又由钢铁厂搜集来筛剩下的焦炭、小石灰石块，几天工夫就炼出了电石、电焊条。紧接着，他们又搞出了几样新产品。这样，综合利用的思想也开始在段里萌芽了。但有些人见到土法制出的产品，却连连摇头。一天，有个同志冲着工长边清波说：
    “老边呵，这真是胡闹，企业公司怎末开起杂货铺来啦？”
      “工地需用这些东西呵！”
    “得打打算盘”那个同志说，“我看准是成本高，质量低，不合算……”
    那时候，“土”、“洋”之争是激烈的，争论的焦点就在这个工段上。这影响到老边和其他的伙伴不禁犹豫起来。散伙罢，那就会影响工程的进度；不散伙罢，有人却在劝阻他们歇业。正在进退两难的时候，党组织出面来给撑腰了。党委书记告诉边清波说：“综合利用是毛主席给咱们指出的路，咱们干得对，要坚持干下去！”这样一来，工人心里就亮堂起来了。
        大家干　大家想
    于是，你找原料，我钻理论，他造设备，一个大搞多种经营、综合利用和大闹技术革命的风暴很快就席卷了整个工段。
    预制厂急需氯化钙。边工长跟小泥工作起试验来。头晕、呕吐，甚至被熏倒了，他们还是坚持试验。到底试制成功了。可是谁也没见过怎样生产。他们就派人到天津化工厂去参观学习，一看，那里的生产设备都是“洋”的，一个电解箱就有一间屋子大；再一打听，设备一时还订购不到，操纵这种设备的技术工人也得培养一、两年。“洋”的是一时指望不上了，怎末办？用土法。从参观那天起，这几个人就一直在琢磨，不知费了多少苦心，终于用“洋”道理琢磨出一套土设备图纸来，只差一个电解箱不好解决了。
    夜晚从化工厂参观回来，他们躺在旅馆的床上还在嘀咕对策。老水泥工夏梦臣，白天特别把那个电解箱观看了一阵。这会儿他思索着：那电解箱是用陶瓷做的，……他突然喊道：“哎，有——啦！他告诉边工长说：“电解箱可以解决了，用水缸！”边清波跟他兴冲冲地打开了电灯，在深夜的灯光下，设计出来最后一个设备：水缸底下钻个眼，上边封闭好，里面搁电解板——这就是他们的电解箱。
    新产品很快投入生产了。氯化钙送到了最需要的工地上。
    这期间，土法在那座小电炉上也开了花。除了炼电石、电焊条以外，有人炼出了锰铁，又有人炼出了金刚砂、矿渣棉……
          这条路走对了
    综合利用工段在蓬勃发展着。它试制生产出来的新产品，像开不败的花朵一般鲜艳夺目。红5月里，公司为搞好综合利用派来了技术员，专门组成一个建筑科学研究室。边清波跟他的伙伴也是这个机构的研究员了。他们的工段已增加到一百多个人，不少家属也参加到段里来生产。
    新来的技术员把他们的试验室放在车间里。他们跟工人一起，同试验，同劳动，当一件产品试验成功时，工人们已经掌握了技术，马上就大量投入生产。
    看这情形，“土腿”也能快步如飞。原来要割“土尾巴”的人，现在也习惯使用这条“土腿”走路了。
    到包钢来参观的人，看了大平炉、大高炉过后，总要顺便观光一下这个工段。大家共同的观感是：土法顶用，走综合利用的路好。
    初夏的太阳照进建筑科学试验室，试验室的桌子上搁着一份新打印好的综合利用规划。规划种类之多是惊人的。而这份规划却正在这个热火朝天的工段里被人们实现着。这里的技术员和工人有着共同的心愿和快乐。这心愿从他们合编的一段快板里洋溢出来了：工地需要啥，我们生产啥，土法上了马，越干劲越大。
