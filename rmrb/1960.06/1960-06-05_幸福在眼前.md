Happiness is Before Our Eyes (Two Diary Entries)
    Wang Xuehai, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Qinghai Guide County Committee

    In April, Guide was a sea of flowers. On this day, the weather was fine, and we walked along the rain-soaked paths to the Wajia Farm. Comrade Ning Guojun, the farm's Party Committee Secretary and Farm Manager, led us to inspect the farm's experimental nursery and paddy fields.

    Leaving the farm headquarters, we entered a newly created orchard, with both sides of the road embankments planted with saplings of Elaeagnus angustifolia, pear trees, apple trees, and other trees, while the crops in the fields were lush and green. Most of the fruit trees were newly planted this year, about 250 mu. Comrade Ning Guojun said: After grafting, these small trees can bear fruit within three years, and those already grafted can bear fruit this year. I looked and listened with excitement, thinking: If I come here again in three years, I will be standing in a sea of fruit trees and flowers.

    Beyond the orchard was the farm's experimental field, with Guide No. 1 and Guide No. 2 wheat, Hebei multitip sorghum, French spinach, Tuoyang scallions, Inner Mongolia sugar beets, Sichuan chard, and so on. It truly had everything from all over the country. Various crops had already sprouted, and the veteran workers were carefully tending to them.

    Growing rice in Guide, at an altitude of more than two thousand meters, is a rare thing. This year, like other communes, this farm also tried growing rice. We came to the edge of the paddy field, the water surface as clear as a mirror, reflecting the green willows and red apricots on the ridges, creating a beautiful natural picture. At this moment, I couldn't help but think of the kind of Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) field scenery I saw when I visited Macheng County, Hubei Province in 1955... People say that the scenery of Jiangnan is beautiful, aren't we catching up with Jiangnan? And we will catch up soon. After we gain experience in planting rice this year, we will plant on a large scale next year. At that time, the people of Guide will be able to eat rice produced by themselves.

    Early in the morning, the tractor rumbled, and my heart followed the sound, racing towards the wasteland. We sat on the tractor and set off for Guo'ertang, twenty miles away. The tractor, pulling a trailer, drove on the undulating and uneven slow mountain road. After half an hour, we walked up the mountain. Comrade Ning Guojun said: There was no road here in the past, this road was built last winter with the help of office cadres. I thought: Indeed, roads are always made by people. In many newly reclaimed areas in our Qinghai, how many such new roads are there! We will tread these new roads and build our beloved Qinghai into an even more beautiful place.

    Guo'ertang is really a good place. It is covered with grass as tall as a person, and on the boundless grassland, the tractor is roaring. The reclamation army is working hard. This year, more than 5,000 mu will be reclaimed here. In order to reclaim and plant more, and achieve a bumper harvest in the same year, the tractor drivers are working in shifts day and night. The reclamation team members are so energetic! In the blink of an eye, the tractor drove past us, turning over the fertile black soil. I grabbed a handful and squeezed it hard. The black soil was still oily. Comrade Tong Heqing, the Party Branch Secretary of the Reclamation Headquarters, said: This year, all these newly reclaimed lands will be planted with grain and oil crops. Calculated at 200 jin per mu, we can harvest 1 million jin of grain. When autumn comes, this virgin land will be a golden ocean.

    幸福在眼前（日记二则）
    中共青海贵德县委书记　王学海
    4月，贵德一片花海。这天，风和日丽，我们踏着雨后小路，到了瓦家农场。场党委书记兼场长宁国钧同志领着我们检查了农场的试验圃和水稻田。
    从场部出去便是一片新造的花果园，在大路两边的地塄坎上栽满了沙枣树、梨树、苹果等树苗，地里的庄稼一片碧绿。果树中大部分是今年新栽的树苗，大约有二百五十亩左右。宁国钧同志说：这些小树经过嫁接后，在三年内就可以结果，已经嫁接过的今年就可以结果。我兴奋地看着、听着，也想着：如果三年以后再来到这里，就会站在果林花海之中了。
    走出果园便是农场的试验田，这里边有贵德一号、贵德二号小麦，河北多头高粱、法国菠菜、陀阳大葱，内蒙古大甜菜，四川牛皮菜等等，真是山南海北应有尽有。各种农作物都已出苗，老工人正在精心地务育着。
    在拔海两千多米高的贵德种水稻是件稀罕事。今年这个农场和其他公社一样，也试种了水稻。我们来到水稻田边，清平如镜的水面，倒映着畦塄坎上的绿柳红杏，构成了一幅美丽的天然图画。这时，不由得使我想起了1955年参观湖北麻城县时所看到的那种江南田野风光……。人说江南风光好，我们这不正在追赶江南吗？而且不久就要赶上了。今年我们取得种植水稻的经验之后，明年将要大面积播种，那时，贵德人民就会吃到自己生产的大米了。
    清早，拖拉机嘟嘟地响着，我的心也随着响声奔向荒地。我们坐在拖拉机上，向二十里以外的郭儿塘出发了。拖拉机挂着拖斗，行驶在起伏不平的慢坡山路上。半个小时后，我们步行上山。宁国钧同志说：这里过去没有路，这条路是去年冬天由机关干部帮助修的。我想：的确，路，总是人走出来的，在我们青海的许多新垦地区，有多少这样的新路啊！我们将踏着这些新路，把祖国可爱的青海建设得更加美丽。
    郭儿塘真是个好地方。长着齐人深的青草，一望无际的草原上，拖拉机在??地响着。开荒大军正在紧张地劳动着。今年这里要开荒五千亩以上，为了多开多种，当年丰收，拖拉机手日夜轮班干。垦荒队员们的干劲真足啊！转眼间，拖拉机从我们身边开了过去，翻起了肥沃的黑土，我抓起一把，用力一捏，黑土里还带着油质。开荒指挥部党支部书记童和庆同志说：今年将这些新开的荒地全部种上粮食和油料作物，每亩按二百斤计算，就可以收粮一百万斤，到秋收季节，这片处女地上将是一片金黄色的海洋。
