    Vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products is a new task put forward to the broad rural people's communes by the new situation of the continuous leap forward in the national economy. This year's summer harvest crops have been launched one after another, which is a great time to vigorously grasp the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products.
    Comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products means to utilize all the seeds, skins, shells, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and juices of domestic and wild plants, and the meat, skins, fur, milk, bones, horns, blood, internal organs, glands, and feces of domestic and wild animals in a planned and rational way, extracting various products and raw materials from them, turning some worthless things into valuable things, and turning some wastes into useful things. It is what people often say: turning the useless into the useful, turning the small use into the big use, and turning one use into multiple uses. For example, processing rice bran, which was originally used as feed, to make various products such as rice bran oil, maltose, white wine, soy sauce, and vinegar, can increase its economic value several times; sorghum stalks, which were originally mainly used as fuel, can be processed into more than a dozen products through comprehensive processing, increasing its economic value more than ten times. According to the calculation of Xiaoxingbao Farm in Fushan County, Shanxi, planting one mu of sorghum produces 300 jin of sorghum seeds, worth 18 yuan; comprehensive utilization of 3,000 jin of sorghum stalks can produce products worth 101 yuan. Since last year, Fushan County has used sorghum stalks to produce products worth more than 160,000 yuan, increasing the income of each farm household in the county by 8 yuan. Making sugar from rice roots and wheat roots, using waste water from cotton stalk degumming to make quick-acting fertilizer, and using scraps and waste materials from fish and animal bodies to make chemical raw materials and medicines will bring even greater economic value.
    Comprehensive utilization truly realizes the ideal of "making the best use of everything" that the Chinese people have pursued for thousands of years, and greatly helps to solve the contradiction of insufficient raw materials in the great development of the national economy, which is of great significance to the comprehensive and sustainable leap forward of China's industrial and agricultural production. After vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, what we get from one mu of land is not just hundreds of jin of grain and thousands of jin of grass, but much more various products: food, feed, utensils, industrial raw materials, etc., making one mu of land worth several mu of land, and one product into several products. Comprehensive utilization is a sign of a major development of social productive forces, a long-term policy for developing industrial and agricultural production, and an important condition for ensuring the high-speed and sustainable leap forward of socialist construction.
    The industries run by rural people's communes should largely be industries that comprehensively utilize agricultural and sideline products. In the past two years, all communes have established industries, trained many technical talents, and created a material and technical foundation for the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the continuous improvement of labor productivity; moreover, in a few more winters and springs, the task of farmland capital construction will gradually decrease, and more and more rural labor forces will be transferred to the industrial front, and the scope of comprehensive utilization of natural resources all over the mountains and plains will become larger and larger. The future agricultural production process will no longer be from sowing to harvesting, but will be extended to processing and comprehensive utilization. All rural cadres must establish the idea of running industries and grasp comprehensive utilization as they grasp agricultural production.
    In rural areas, can the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products be realized if there is a shortage of ready-made equipment and technical talents? The experience of various places proves that as long as we are determined to proceed from reality, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products can certainly be achieved. In the past, rural areas in China had the habit of comprehensively utilizing agricultural and sideline products. But in the era of small-scale peasant economy, it was small-scale, primitive, unorganized and unplanned. Now, relying on large-scale people's communes that implement diversified operations and have considerable manpower and material resources, taking measures to make do with whatever is available, relying on our own efforts, starting with indigenous methods, and gradually improving, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products can be greatly developed. Xinbo People's Commune in Weichang County, Hebei Province, used wheat straw to produce high-quality pulp based on roller mills and grinding workshops. The county uses 27 roller mills to produce more than 10,000 jin of pulp every day. Farmers in Changli, Lulong and other areas use indigenous methods to manufacture starch, exporting thousands of tons every year, and the quality fully meets international standards. The technology of comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products is not as difficult to learn as some people imagine. As long as we earnestly rely on the masses and give full play to their wisdom and strength, technical problems are not difficult to solve. Now most commune-run industries already have a certain foundation, and relevant departments can also provide some support in terms of equipment and technology, which will play a certain role in solving equipment and technology problems. Baodi County, Hebei Province, takes the county paper mill as the center and forms a comprehensive utilization and processing system of wheat straw including 93 small factories of various communes and teams. The paper mill is responsible for guidance, and the factories regularly exchange experience. The technical level is rapidly improved, and more than 5,000 people in the county have mastered the technology of comprehensive utilization of wheat straw, producing pulp, wine, starch, soy sauce, vinegar, fiberboard and other products.
    Some people worry that vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products may reduce the source of fertilizer, fuel and feed. This is an unnecessary concern. There are many things that can be used as fuel and fertilizer in rural areas, and the comprehensive utilization of certain agricultural and sideline products will never affect the large source of fuel and fertilizer. Especially due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fishery, and the development of the "small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" movements to collect wild plants, the objects of comprehensive utilization in rural areas are extremely wide. As long as it is arranged well, it will also increase the source of fertilizer and fuel. As for feed, after the comprehensive processing of agricultural and sideline products, not only will it not be reduced, but many things that could not be used as feed will become feed, and many coarse feeds will become fine feeds, thereby increasing the source of feed, especially pig feed. For example, rice bran is feed. After comprehensive utilization and extraction of oil, sugar, wine and other products, the remaining distiller's grains are still feed. Rape stalks and rape pods could not be fed to pigs originally, but after processing and oil extraction, they become good pig feed. Sesame stalks have always been used as fuel. After oil extraction, the oil cake becomes good feed, and the weight is increased by 60% to 70%. On this issue, we must both calculate small accounts and calculate big accounts. Only calculating small accounts will sometimes feel uneconomical. Calculating big and small accounts together can see the full effect of comprehensive utilization. Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, vigorously developed the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, providing a large amount of feed for animal husbandry. Last year, large livestock increased by 11.8%, and pigs increased by more than one and a half times; animal husbandry drove the development of planting industry, and the grain yield per mu increased by 23.9% compared with 1958.
    With the development of the socialist cause, urban and rural people and foreign trade need more and more industrial and agricultural products, industry needs more and more raw materials, and animal husbandry, with pigs as the head, needs a large amount of fine and coarse feed. These tasks urgently require us to vigorously develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products and the comprehensive utilization of various resources. It is both necessary and possible. Rural work cadres, people's commune members, use the energy of grasping agricultural production to vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products!

    大搞农副产品的综合利用
    大搞农副产品的综合利用，是国民经济连续跃进的新形势向广大农村人民公社提出的新任务。今年夏收作物已经先后登场，正是大抓农副产品综合利用的大好时机。
    农副产品综合利用，就是把家生和野生植物的籽、皮、壳、叶、茎、根、花、果、汁，家生和野生动物的肉、皮、毛、奶、骨、角、血、脏、腺、粪等，全部有计划地合理地利用起来，从中提制各种产品和原料，使一些不值钱的东西变成值钱的东西，把一些废物制成有用的东西。也就是人们常说的变无用为有用，变小用为大用，变一用为多用。比如，把原来用作饲料的米糠进行加工，制成糠油、饴糖、白酒、酱油、醋等多种产品，经济价值提高数倍；原来主要用作燃料的高粱秆，经过综合加工，可以制成十几种产品，经济价值提高十多倍。据山西浮山县小邢堡农场计算，种一亩高粱，产高粱籽三百斤，价值十八元；把三千斤高粱秆加以综合利用，所得产品价值一百零一元。浮山县从去年开始，已经利用高粱秆制成价值十六万多元的产品，全县每一农户因此增加了八元的收入。用稻根、麦根制糖，用棉秆脱胶的废水制造速效肥料，用鱼类、畜体的下脚废料制成化工原料和医药用品，在这些方面增加的经济价值还要大。
    综合利用真正实现了我国人民千百年来“物尽其用”的理想，大有助于解决国民经济大发展中某些原材料不足的矛盾，对于我国工农业生产全面的持续的跃进有着重大的意义。大搞农副产品综合利用以后，我们从一亩地里得到的就不仅仅是几百斤粮和几千斤草，而是比这些多得多的各种各样的产品：食品、饲料、用具、工业原料等等，使一亩地顶几亩地用，一种产品变成几种产品。综合利用是社会生产力重大发展的一个标志，是发展工农业生产的长期的方针，是保证社会主义建设事业高速度地持续跃进的重要条件。
    农村人民公社办的工业，很大一部分应该是综合利用农副产品的工业。两年来，所有公社都办了工业，培养了许多技术人材，给农副产品全面综合利用创造物质的和技术的基础。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，劳动生产率的不断提高；而且再有若干个冬春，农田基本建设的任务将逐渐减少，向工业战线转移的农村劳动力会越来越多，综合利用满山遍野的自然资源的范围会越来越大。今后的农业生产过程不再是从播种到收获，而要延伸到加工，到综合利用。所有农村干部都要树立办工业的思想，像抓农业生产一样地抓综合利用。
    在农村中，现成设备和技术人材两缺，能不能实现农副产品综合利用呢？各地的经验证明，只要下定决心从实际出发，综合利用农副产品一定可以办到。过去，我国农村素有综合利用农副产品的习惯。但在小农经济时代，那是小规模的、原始的、无组织无计划的。现在依靠大型的、实行多种经营的、人力物力相当雄厚的人民公社，采取因陋就简，自力更生，土法上马，由简单到完善的方法，完全可以大搞农副产品综合利用。河北围场县新拨人民公社以碾棚、磨坊为基础，用麦秸制出优质纸浆。全县利用二十七处碾磨坊，每天生产一万多斤纸浆。昌黎、卢龙一带农民用土法制造淀粉，每年出口数千吨，质量完全达到国际标准。综合利用农副产品的技术，并不像某些人想像的那么难学。只要认真依靠群众，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，技术问题是不难解决的。现在多数社办工业已有一定的基础，有关部门还能从设备上、技术上给予一些支援，这对解决设备和技术问题都有一定的作用。河北宝坻县以县造纸厂为中心，组成包括各社、队的九十三个小型工厂的麦秸综合利用加工体系，造纸厂负责指导，各厂经常交流经验，技术水平迅速提高，全县已有五千多人掌握了综合利用麦秸的技术，生产出纸浆、酒、淀粉、酱油、醋、纤维板等多种产品。
    有人担心大搞农副产品综合利用，可能减少了肥料、燃料和饲料的来源。这是一种不必要的顾虑。农村可以用作燃料和肥料的东西是很多的，绝不会因为综合利用某些农副产品而影响了燃料、肥料的大量的来源。特别是由于农林牧副渔的全面发展，“小夏收”，“小秋收”采集野生植物运动的发展，农村综合利用的对象是极为广泛的。只要安排得好，还会增加肥料、燃料的来源。至于饲料，经过对农副产品的综合加工，不仅不会减少，反而会使很多原来不能做饲料的东西变成饲料，使很多粗饲料变成精饲料，从而增加了饲料特别是猪饲料的来源。例如，米糠是饲料，经过综合利用，提制出油、糖、酒等产品以后，剩的酒糟还是饲料。油菜秆和油菜荚本来不能喂猪，加工榨油以后，却变成了很好的猪饲料。芝麻秆历来只作燃料用，榨油以后，油饼变成好饲料，分量还增加了六、七成。在这个问题上，既要算小账，更要算大账。光算小账，有时会感到不合算，大账小账一齐算，就能看到综合利用的全部效果。山西五寨县大力开展农副产品的综合利用，为畜牧业提供了大量饲料，去年大牲畜增加11．8％，猪增加一倍半以上；畜牧业带动了种植业的发展，粮食亩产量比1958年提高23．9％。
    随着社会主义事业的发展，城乡人民和对外贸易都需要越来越多的工农业产品，工业需要越来越多的原材料，以猪为首的畜牧业需要大量精粗饲料，这些任务迫切要求我们大搞农副产品的加工和各种资源的综合利用。既有必要，又有可能。农村工作干部们，人民公社社员们，用大抓农业生产的劲头大搞农副产品的综合利用！
