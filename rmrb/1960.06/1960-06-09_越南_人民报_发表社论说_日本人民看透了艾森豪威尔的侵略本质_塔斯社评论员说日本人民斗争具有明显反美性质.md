Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today on the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-US military alliance treaty, saying that the political general strike held by Japanese workers on June 4 mobilized and gathered broad masses of people from all walks of life in Japan, directing the spearhead of struggle at the US imperialist aggressors and their running dog Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary clique. This is the largest and most significant characteristic of the Japanese working class and laboring people in the new upsurge of struggle. This shows that the Japanese working class and people are increasingly clear about who their enemies are, and are increasingly clearly aware of the goals and significance of their struggle.

The editorial emphasized that the Japanese working class and people's fierce struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs has become a huge force in the developing anti-US struggle of the Asian people. The struggle of the Japanese working class and people will cut off the most important link in the US imperialist strategic system in Asia and will play a great role in the Asian situation.

Referring to Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan, the editorial stated that the Japanese people, like the people of Asia and the world, have seen through Eisenhower's belligerent and aggressive nature. The editorial said that the second national political general strike to be held by the Japanese working class and people will surely further accelerate the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke group's rule.

The editorial said that the Vietnamese people, together with the people of Asia and the world, fully support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, resolutely stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese people in the struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, and resolutely demand that US imperialism get out of Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Laos, and other places in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. TASS commentator Kharikov wrote in a commentary on the Japanese situation on June 6: The nationwide political strike in Japan on June 4 shows that the Nobusuke Kishi government is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the crisis caused by his kowtowing to the United States. This strike shows that the Japanese people are determined to smash the shackles of the military alliance with the United States, which Kishi Nobusuke and his American protectors are trying to impose on Japan.

The commentary pointed out that the anti-popular face of the Japanese ruling class has never been so nakedly exposed. The characteristic of the events currently taking place in Japan is that it has an obvious anti-American character.

The commentary said that the struggle to force the Nobusuke Kishi government to resign and the movement against Eisenhower's visit are two interrelated aspects of the Japanese people's struggle to abolish the Japan-US military alliance, which stakes Japan's fate as a gamble. The commentary also said that the US president's visit to Japan is by no means well-intentioned, but is related to "inspecting" military bases. The Japanese people link Nobusuke Kishi's resignation with the need to dissolve the Diet, which will thwart the ruling class's plan to bring the military alliance with the United States into effect.

The commentary concluded that Nobusuke Kishi and his political partners put subservience to the United States above the interests of the nation. However, the will of the people cannot be mocked. The shameful fate of Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and other anti-popular regimes illustrates this point.

    越南“人民报”发表社论说
    日本人民看透了艾森豪威尔的侵略本质
    塔斯社评论员说日本人民斗争具有明显反美性质
    新华社河内7日电　越南“人民报”今天就日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争发表社论说，日本工人6月4日举行的政治总罢工，动员和集合了日本各阶层广大人民，把斗争矛头指向美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗岸信介反动集团，这是日本工人阶级和劳动人民在新的斗争高潮中最大的、最有重大意义的特点。这说明日本工人阶级和人民越来越看清谁是自己的敌人，越来越清楚地意识到自己的斗争的目标和意义。
    社论强调指出，日本工人阶级和人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的猛烈的斗争，已经成为正在发展着的亚洲人民反美斗争中的一个巨大力量。日本工人阶级和人民的斗争将切断美帝国主义在亚洲的战略体系中最重要的环节，对亚洲局势将起很大的作用。
    社论在谈到艾森豪威尔准备到日本访问时说，日本人民和亚洲、世界人民一样，已经看透了艾森豪威尔的好战和侵略的本质。社论说，日本工人阶级和人民即将举行的第二次全国政治总罢工，一定会进一步加速岸信介集团统治的崩溃。
    社论说，越南人民同亚洲和世界人民一起，全力支持日本人民英勇的斗争，坚决同日本人民并肩进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，坚决要求美帝国主义从日本、南朝鲜、土耳其、台湾、南越、老挝和亚洲其他地方滚去出。
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社评论员哈里科夫6日在一篇关于日本局势的评论中写道：6月4日的日本全国政治性罢工表明，岸信介政府越来越深地陷入了由于他在美国面前卑躬屈膝而引起的危机的泥塘中。这次罢工表明，日本人民决心粉碎同美国缔结军事同盟的桎梏，而岸信介和他的美国庇护者正在企图把这个军事同盟强加于日本的头上。
    评论指出，日本上层统治者的反人民面目从来没有这样赤裸裸地暴露出来。目前在日本发生的事件的特点是它具有明显的反美性质。
    评论说，为争取岸信介政府辞职的斗争和反对艾森豪威尔访问的运动，这是日本人民要求废除把日本命运作为赌注的日美军事同盟的斗争的两个互相联系的方面。评论又说，美国总统访问日本绝不是善意的，而是同“视察”军事基地有关。日本人民把岸信介辞职跟必须解散国会联系起来，这就会使上层统治者想使同美国的军事同盟生效的计划破产。
    评论最后说，岸信介和他的政治上的伙伴把对美国的屈从放在民族的利益之上。但是，人民的意志是不容嘲弄的。李承晚、曼德列斯和其他一些反人民政权的可耻命运，就说明了这一点。
