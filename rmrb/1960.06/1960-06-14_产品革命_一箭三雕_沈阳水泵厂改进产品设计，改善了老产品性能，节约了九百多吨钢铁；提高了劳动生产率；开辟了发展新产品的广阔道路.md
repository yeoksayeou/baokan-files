Product Revolution Achieves "Three Birds with One Stone"
Shenyang Water Pump Factory improves product design, improving the performance of old products, saving more than 900 tons of steel; increasing labor productivity; and opening up broad avenues for developing new products.

(Our correspondent from Shenyang, 13th) The Shenyang Water Pump Factory has launched a mass product design revolution, achieving the effect of "three birds with one stone": it has improved the performance of old products and saved raw materials, while also increasing labor productivity. This has not only created favorable conditions for doubling production this year, but also opened up broad avenues for developing "high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new" products.

Starting in the fourth quarter of last year, the factory, while advancing towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, launched a mass product design revolution. After six waves of design revolution, 61 of the more than 120 specifications of old products planned for production this year have been successfully reformed, and 53 have been put into production or are being put into production. As a result of the reformed products becoming smaller in size, lighter in weight, simpler in structure, and higher in efficiency, the factory has greatly saved raw materials and reduced labor hours while ensuring and improving product quality. Using the materials originally used to manufacture one water pump, it is now possible to manufacture two, three, or even a dozen water pumps, and the manufacturing time has been shortened. A power station water pump that the factory recently successfully reformed originally weighed 1,018 kilograms, but now weighs only 140 kilograms. Originally, processing one required 153 labor hours, but now it only requires 42 labor hours. Based on the calculation of only 29 kinds of products, design reform this year can save more than 6,000 tons of steel materials and 450,000 labor hours. Through reforming old product designs and vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, the factory has initially broken through the three major production bottlenecks of materials, equipment, and labor, realizing the requirements of "increased production without increasing materials, one ton doing the work of two tons, increased production without increasing manpower, one person doing the work of two people," and "increased production without increasing equipment, one machine doing the work of two machines," which will play a significant role in ensuring the leap forward in production this year.

The achievements of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory in reforming product design prove that vigorously carrying out mass movements to reform product design is also an important way to create "high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new" products. Many old products in this factory, after reform, have been "reborn" and become uniquely styled new products. For example, they reformed a condensation pump that originally weighed 560 kilograms into a small and exquisite new water pump weighing only 60 kilograms, which not only saved raw materials and processing labor hours, but also increased the use efficiency by 5%. In reforming deep-well water pumps, the factory's employees also researched and manufactured a water-resistant motor, moving the motor that used to be installed on the well to underground, directly connected to the water pump, making this deep-well water pump a product with modern technological standards.

In the process of reforming product design, the employees of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory conscientiously implemented the principle of everything being tested and serving the users. They sent people to visit users in more than 20 cities and more than 50 rural people's communes, taking the more than 200 opinions put forward by users as the main data for reforming product design. They also adhered to the "three-in-one combination" working method inside and outside the factory. For example, in the process of trial-producing waterproof motors and changing deep-well water pumps into submersible water pumps, veteran workers closely combined with technicians, conducting nearly 100 experiments and obtaining assistance from many units outside the factory. After the product reform had undergone repeated tests and scientific appraisals and then finalized, it was immediately organized for mass production in order to quickly obtain economic results. From January to May this year, the factory had already manufactured more than 4,000 reformed products, saving more than 900 tons of steel materials.

    产品革命“一箭三雕”
    沈阳水泵厂改进产品设计，改善了老产品性能，节约了九百多吨钢铁；提高了劳动生产率；开辟了发展新产品的广阔道路
    本报沈阳13日电　沈阳水泵厂开展群众性的产品设计革命，收到了“一箭三雕”的效果：既改善了老产品的性能，节约了原材料，又提高了劳动生产率，不仅为今年生产翻番创造了有利条件，而且为发展“高、大、精、尖、新”产品开辟了广阔的道路。
    这个厂从去年第四季度开始，在向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军的同时，就开展了群众性的产品设计革命。经过六次设计革命高潮，今年计划生产的一百二十多种规格的老产品中，已经改革成功的有六十一种，已经或正在投入生产的有五十三种。由于经过改革的产品体积由大变小，重量由重变轻，结构由繁变简，效率由低变高，这便在保证和提高产品质量的条件下，大大节约了原材料，节省了工时。利用原来制造一台水泵的材料，现在可以制造两、三台以至十几台水泵，并且缩短了制造的时间。这个厂不久以前改造成功的一种电站用的水泵，原来重量一千零十八公斤，现在只有一百四十公斤，原来加工一台需要一百五十三个工时，现在只要四十二个工时。仅是根据二十九种产品的计算，由于改革设计，今年就可以节省钢铁材料六千多吨，节省工时四十五万个。经过改革老产品设计和大闹机械化、自动化，全厂初步突破了材料、设备、劳动力三大生产关键，实现了“增产不增料，一吨顶两吨，增产不增人，一人顶两人”、“增产不增设备，一台顶两台”的要求，对保证今年生产跃进将起重大作用。
    沈阳水泵厂改革产品设计的成果证明，大搞改革产品设计的群众运动，也是创造“高、大、精、尖、新”产品的一个重要途径。这个厂的不少老产品经过改革以后，已经“脱胎换骨”，变成独具风格的新型产品。例如，他们把原来重达五百六十公斤的一种凝结水泵，改革为一种小巧玲珑的只有六十公斤重的新型水泵，不但节约了原材料和加工工时，而且使用效率提高了5％。全厂职工在改革深井水泵中，还研究制成一种不怕水的电动机，把过去装在井上的电动机搬到井下，同水泵直接连在一起，使这种深井水泵一跃而为具有现代新技术水平的产品。
    沈阳水泵厂职工在改革产品设计过程中，认真贯彻执行了一切经过试验和为用户服务的原则。他们曾派人先后到二十多个城市和五十多个农村人民公社访问用户，把用户提出的二百多项意见作为改革产品设计的主要资料。他们还坚持了厂内外“三结合”的工作方法。如试制防水电动机，把深井水泵改为潜水水泵的过程中，老工人同技术人员密切结合，先后试验近百次，并且取得了厂外许多单位的协助。当产品改革经过反复试验和科学鉴定然后定型以后，便立即组织成批生产，以便迅速取得经济效果。今年1月到5月，这个厂就已制造出四千多台经过改革的产品，节省了九百多吨钢铁材料。（附图片）
