Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce held a rally today. Industrial and commercial figures attending the meeting unanimously expressed their firm support for the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops and their firm support for the just struggle of the people of Asian countries and patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip.

    The meeting was presided over by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. In his speech at the meeting, he first pointed out that the "visit" to Taiwan by the "plague god" Eisenhower was a blatant war provocation against the Chinese people. He said: The tens of thousands of artillery shells fired by our Fujian Front troops represent the powerful will of our 650 million people to resolutely oppose the American aggressors, and express the Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower. Chen Shutong resolutely said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we Chinese industrialists and businesspeople and their families will certainly unite with the people of Asia and the peace-loving people of the world to wage the most resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    Hu Ziang and Le Songsheng, both Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke at the meeting. Hu Ziang said that the people of South Korea, Japan, and all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America enslaved by imperialism are uniting more extensively and launching a surging wave of anger against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. The people of the world have already tolled the death knell for U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism will inevitably be buried forever in the tide of struggle of the people of the world.

    Li Guowei, Pu Jiexiu, Ling Qijun, and Sun Fuling, all Standing Committee members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke at the meeting. They all severely condemned Eisenhower's bandit trip. Li Guowei said that U.S. imperialism is following the old path of Hitler's Germany, and Hitler's fate is awaiting it. Pu Jiexiu said: We must fight to the end to completely smash any imperialist plot of aggression and liberate Taiwan. Ling Qijun said that U.S. imperialism is running into snags everywhere, and its doomed end of being battered and bloodied by the just struggles of the people of the world is inevitable. Sun Fuling pointed out that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, which no force can stop, and the day when U.S. imperialism is driven out of Taiwan will surely come.

    At the end of the rally, Chen Shutong also led all attendees in shouting slogans against U.S. imperialism's aggression against China's territory of Taiwan.

    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员胡子昂、乐松生都在会上讲了话。胡子昂说，南朝鲜、日本和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切被帝国主义奴役的国家的人民，正在更加广泛地团结起来，汹涌澎湃地掀起反对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的怒潮，全世界人民已经敲响了美帝国主义的丧钟。美帝国主义必然会在全世界人民的斗争浪潮中被永远埋葬掉。
    全国工商联常务委员李国伟、浦洁修、淩其峻和孙孚凌也在会上讲了话。他们都严厉谴责了艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，李国伟说，美帝国主义正在走希特勒德国的老路，希特勒的结局正在等待着它。浦洁修说：我们一定要为彻底粉碎帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋和解放台湾而奋斗到底。淩其峻说，美帝国主义正在到处碰壁，它被全世界人民的正义斗争碰得头破血流惨败的下场是注定了的。孙孚凌指出，中国人民一定要解放台湾，这是任何力量也阻挡不了的，美帝国主义被中国人民赶出台湾的日子一定会来到。
    在集会结束的时候，陈叔通还带领全体出席人员高呼反对美帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾的口号。
