Xinhua News Agency, June 26th. The capital's militia anti-American imperialism demonstration will be held on the morning of the 27th. The Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast the live proceedings of the conference on the morning of the 27th, starting at 7:50 a.m., using the frequency of the first set of programs. Beijing Television will also broadcast it simultaneously.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th. Hundreds of millions of militiamen across the country, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, angrily denounce the American bandits for occupying our Taiwan and stepping up the promotion of the sinister activities of "two Chinas", condemn the "plague god" Eisenhower's Asian bandit trip, and unanimously express their determination to smash all war provocations by American imperialism and drive the American bandits out of Taiwan.

From the time the "plague god" Eisenhower began his Asian bandit trip to the days when he dejectedly sneaked back to the United States, militia divisions and regiments in various parts of the country, angered by the American bandits' aggressive crimes, have generally held large-scale demonstrations against the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism. Heroic militiamen on the Fujian front bravely took to the front lines, and together with the People's Liberation Army, bombarded and drove away the "plague god" Eisenhower. In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, and Kunming, thousands of militiamen held rallies and demonstrations in factories, schools, government agencies, and streets, denouncing American imperialism for occupying our territory of Taiwan.

At various gatherings, militiamen fiercely exposed the aggressive and bellicose nature of the American bandits, expressing their determination to stand in diametrical opposition to the American bandits. They said that it is difficult to change one's nature, and imperialism is bound to engage in aggression and war. Ten years ago, the American war-monger Dulles single-handedly planned the Korean War on the 38th parallel, and at the same time, the American bandits occupied our territory of Taiwan. Ten years later, the American aggressor troops are still killing, arsoning and committing all kinds of evils in South Korea. The American pirate fleet is also constantly carrying out war provocations against us in the Taiwan Strait. Recently, the "plague god" Eisenhower planned a new war and conspired to create "two Chinas," which fully proves that American imperialism is the culprit of war and the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. To deal with such jackals, we must thoroughly expose their hypocritical masks and resolutely fight them to the end. The militiamen of Zhanglou Village in Shandong Province gnashed their teeth when they mentioned imperialism. Old militia heroes Wang Zhenrui, Zhang Tonghai, Ji Cheng Shen and others during the Anti-Japanese War angrily said that imperialism is a jackal that drinks human blood. Fifteen years ago, Japanese imperialism bloodbathed Zhanglou and massacred more than 300 of our compatriots. We will never tolerate the heinous crimes of the "plague god" Eisenhower, who is actively reviving Japanese militarism and resolutely hostile to us. We, the Chinese people, who have won victory in the anti-imperialist struggle, know how to teach aggressive bandits a lesson. Ten thousand young people on the Xiamen front gathered on the 25th, angrily denouncing the aggressive crimes of the American bandits. Militia hero Huang Qingshui, "Little Eighth Route Army" He Danian and other young people shouted together: "Down with American imperialism!" Xiong Yousheng, the militia captain of the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, a veteran who had severely attacked the American aggressor troops in Korea, said heroically that in the eyes of the great Chinese people, the American bandits are nothing but paper tigers, defeated generals who were beaten black and blue by the Chinese and Korean people, and they are "thunder gods hitting tofu," specializing in bullying the weak. As long as we resolutely fight against it, it will not dare to be fierce. Wang Jisheng, the militia company commander of Wulongbei in Liaoning Province, couldn't stop laughing at the American softies when he recalled how they captured eleven airborne special agents, including American Colonel Commander Arnold, eight years ago. He said that when he captured the American Major Operations Officer Baumo alive, he shouted: "Don't move, hand over your guns!" The American devil screamed and collapsed in fright. He said that this is the true face of the American bandits. Eleven fully armed jackals surrendered obediently under the encirclement of our militiamen.

Many militiamen wrote poems, painted pictures, sang songs, and performed dramas, rejoicing that the artillery on the Fujian front bombarded the "plague god" well, exposing the embarrassing appearance of American imperialism. A militiaman wrote in a gun poem "'Plague God' goes to the Far East": "'Plague God' goes to the Far East, stinking all the way, doing all the bad things, losing all the prestige. Alas, the American president is like a rat running across the street, everyone shouting to beat him." The militiaman Huang Wenxiang said and sang at the protest demonstration: "American devils, get out, get out of Korea, get out of Taiwan, if you dare to launch a war again, we will definitely make you drown in the great ocean of all people being soldiers."

    美帝胆敢发动战争定叫它淹死在全民皆兵的海洋中
    亿万民兵愤怒声讨美国强盗
    首都民兵今日举行反美示威大会
    新华社26日讯　首都民兵反对美帝国主义示威大会将在27日上午举行。中央人民广播电台将从27日上午七点五十分开始，用第一套节目的频率转播大会的实况。北京电视台也同时转播。
    新华社26日讯　具有光荣革命传统的全国亿万民兵，愤怒声讨美国强盗霸占我台湾，加紧推行“两个中国”的罪恶活动，谴责“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的亚洲强盗旅行，一致表示坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切战争挑衅活动，把美国强盗赶出台湾。
    从“瘟神”艾森豪威尔开始他亚洲强盗旅行到他垂头丧气溜回美国的这些天来，被美国强盗侵略罪行所激怒的全国各地民兵师团，普遍举行声势浩大的示威，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。福建前线英雄民兵奋勇上阵，和解放军并肩轰逐“瘟神”艾森豪威尔。在北京、天津、上海、南京、济南、广州、武汉、沈阳、兰州、昆明，成千上万民兵，在工厂、学校、机关、街道，纷纷举行集会和示威，声讨美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾。
    民兵们在各种集会上，狠狠揭露美国强盗侵略成性的好战本质，表示坚决和美国强盗誓不两立。他们说，江山易改，本性难移，帝国主义就是要搞侵略、搞战争。十年前，美国战争贩子杜勒斯在“三八线”上一手策划了侵朝战争，同时美国强盗霸占了我国领土台湾。十年后的现在，美国侵略军仍然在南朝鲜杀人放火，无恶不作。美国的海盗舰队也仍然在台湾海峡不断向我进行战争挑衅。最近，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔策划新战争，阴谋制造
  “两个中国”，更充分地证明，美帝国主义是战争的祸首，是全世界人民最凶恶敌人。对付这样的豺狼，一定要彻底剥开它伪善的画皮，坚决和它斗争到底。山东张楼村的民兵，提起帝国主义个个咬牙切齿。抗日战争时期的老民兵英雄王振瑞、张同海、季承申等愤怒地说，帝国主义就是喝人血的豺狼，十五年前，日本帝国主义血洗张楼，残杀我们三百多同胞。“瘟神”艾森豪威尔积极复活日本军国主义、坚决与我为敌的滔天罪行，我们绝不能容忍。我们从反帝国主义斗争中取得胜利的中国人民，是懂得怎样教训侵略强盗的。厦门前线十万青年25日集会，怒斥美国强盗的侵略罪行。民兵英雄黄清水、“小八路”何大年等和广大青年一起高喊：“打倒美帝国主义！” 曾经在朝鲜痛击过美国侵略军的志愿军复员军人、福建省农业机械厂民兵队长熊友生豪迈地说，美国强盗在伟大中国人民眼里，不过是一只纸老虎，被中朝人民打得鼻青脸肿的手下败将，它是“雷公打豆腐”，专拣软的欺。只要我们坚决同它斗争，它才不敢行凶。辽宁省五龙背民兵连长王吉生，想起八年前他们生擒美国上校司令阿诺德等十一名空投特务的经过，不住口地耻笑美国熊包。他说，他在活捉美国少校作战官包莫时，大喝一声：“不许动，缴枪！ ”这个美国鬼子嚎叫一声就吓瘫了。他说，这就是美国强盗的本来面目。十一个全副武装的豺狼，在我们民兵包围下，乖乖地投降了。
    许多民兵写诗作画，唱歌演剧，欢唱福建前线炮兵炮轰“瘟神”打得好，大揭美帝国主义狼狈相。一个民兵在“‘瘟神’下远东”的枪杆诗中写道：“‘瘟神’下远东，一路臭乎乎，做尽了坏事，丢光了威风。呜呼美国总统，过街老鼠人人轰。”民兵黄文祥在抗议示威集会上边说边唱：“美国鬼，快滚蛋，滚出朝鲜，滚出台湾，胆敢再发动战争，定叫你淹死在全民皆兵的大海洋。”（附图片）
