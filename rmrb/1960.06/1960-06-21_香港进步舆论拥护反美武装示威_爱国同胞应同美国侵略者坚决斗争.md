Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th. Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po," "Ta Kung Pao," "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," and "New Evening News" have all published commentaries, and many prominent figures in Hong Kong have also published written statements in newspapers, condemning Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan and expressing support for the People's Liberation Army's anti-American armed demonstrations on the Jinmen front.

"Wen Wei Po" published a commentary on the 18th, saying: The shelling "greeting" at the Fujian front is a contempt and disdain for Eisenhower. The commentary said: "The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan." "Ta Kung Pao's" editorial severely condemned the US imperialists' conspiracy to actively create "two Chinas." It also pointed out that the US imperialists appear powerful, but are actually weak. Recent facts are sufficient to prove that as long as we resolutely struggle against it, we can defeat it. The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" commentary wrote that Eisenhower's visit this time is ill-intentioned and not well-meaning. "All patriotic Chinese people should unite and resolutely struggle against the American aggressors." "New Evening News" said: Eisenhower's visit is detrimental to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique. It asked: Isn't it a fact that the Americans are instigating "Taiwan autonomy" and creating opposition parties there?

Prominent figures from all walks of life in Hong Kong have published statements in newspapers. Chen Pishi, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, said: Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan is an attempt to annex Taiwan, our country's territory, and promote the "two Chinas" conspiracy. The People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front "greeted" him with shelling, demonstrating the Chinese people's firm determination to liberate Taiwan. Tang Bingda, chairman of the Hong Kong North-South Merchants Association, expressed full support for the communique of the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front Command. He said that shelling Jinmen to "greet" Eisenhower precisely demonstrates the Chinese people's contempt for him and shows the Chinese people's solemn position to liberate Taiwan. Ye Ruolin, deputy treasurer of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: Eisenhower is a rat crossing the street, and everyone shouts to beat him. His "visit" this time has been opposed everywhere. This time, he went to Taiwan to practice tricks, attempting to occupy Taiwan, our country's territory, for a long time. This conspiracy is bound to go bankrupt in front of the 600 million Chinese people. Cultural figure Chen Junbao said: Eisenhower, who pretends to be a "peace envoy," wanted to come to Asia this time to show off his power, but he was forced to announce the suspension of his "visit" to Japan as soon as he arrived in Manila. This is an extremely disgraceful thing for the United States, and this is the result that those who do all kinds of evil deserve. Film figures Wu Chufan, Li Pingqian, Gong Qiuxia, Shi Hui, Fu Qi, Xie Yizhi, etc., pointed out that Eisenhower's forced suspension of his "visit" to Japan shows that the US imperialists' aggressive policy has suffered another serious blow, and at the same time, it has once again exposed its paper tiger true face in front of the people of the world.

    香港进步舆论拥护反美武装示威
    爱国同胞应同美国侵略者坚决斗争
    炮轰“瘟神”表明中国人民蔑视、鄙视美帝国主义
    美国吞并台湾和制造“两个中国”阴谋必遭破产
    新华社香港20日电　香港“文汇报”、“大公报”、“香港商报”和“新晚报”纷纷发表评论，许多香港著名人士也在报纸上发表书面谈话，谴责艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾并表示拥护人民解放军在金门前线举行反美武装示威。
    “文汇报”18日发表评论说：福建前线打炮“迎送”，是对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。评论说：“中国人民一定要解放台湾。”“大公报”的社论严厉地谴责了美帝国主义积极制造“两个中国”的阴谋。并且指出，美帝国主义者貌似强大，其实是虚弱的。最近的许多事实，足以证明只要坚决同它斗争，就可以打倒它。“香港商报”的评论写道，艾森豪威尔这回是来者不善，善者不来的。“一切有爱国心的中国人，都应当团结起来，同美国侵略者坚决斗争”。“新晚报”说：艾森豪威尔此来，对台湾蒋介石集团是不利的，它问道：美国人在你们那里策动“台湾自治”，制造反对派，这难道不是事实。
    香港各界著名人士纷纷在报纸上发表了谈话。香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士说：艾森豪威尔到台湾“访问”，是企图吞并我国领土台湾，推行“两个中国”阴谋。福建前线人民解放军以炮轰“迎送”他，表明了中国人民一定要解放台湾的坚强意志。香港南北行公所理事长汤秉达表示，完全拥护人民解放军福建前线司令部的文告。他说，炮轰金门“迎送”艾森豪威尔，正表示了中国人民对他的蔑视，表明了中国人民一定要解放台湾的严正立场。中华总商会副司库叶若林说：艾森豪威尔是过街老鼠，人人喊打，他这次东来“访问”，到处都遭到反对。这次又到台湾去施诡计，企图长期霸占我国领土台湾，这一阴谋是一定要在中国六亿人民面前破产的。文化界人士陈君葆说：冒充“和平使者”的艾森豪威尔这次想来亚洲耀武扬威，才到了马尼拉就被迫宣布中止“访问”日本，这是美国极丢脸的一件事，这正是无恶不作者应得的结果。电影界人士吴楚帆、李萍倩、龚秋霞、石慧、傅奇、谢益之等指出：艾森豪威尔这次被迫中止“访问”日本，表明了美帝国主义的侵略政策又遭到了一次严重的打击，同时又一次在世界人民面前暴露了它的纸老虎真面目。
