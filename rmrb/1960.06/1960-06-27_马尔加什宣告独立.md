Xinhua News Agency, Tananarive, June 26th: The former French colony of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, declared its independence today.

	This morning, the declaration of independence ceremony was held in Tananarive, the capital of Madagascar. Malagasy President Tsiranana and French Secretary of State for "Community" Affairs, Jean Foyer, respectively read the declaration of independence in Malagasy and French at the ceremony, which was attended by about 100,000 people, announcing that Madagascar would be independent within the scope of the "French Community" from the 26th.

	Since French colonialists invaded and declared Madagascar a "French territory" in 1896, the people there have been fighting bravely against French colonial rule and for the independence of their motherland. Earlier this year, the French government was forced to agree to the independence of this East African island nation in June this year. However, the French authorities, through a so-called document determining the status of Madagascar, stipulated that Madagascar should continue to remain within the scope of the adjusted "French Community" after independence.

    马尔加什宣告独立
    据新华社26日讯　塔那那利佛消息：位于非洲东海岸印度洋中的前法国殖民地马尔加什（即马达加斯加）今天宣布独立。
    当天上午，在马尔加什首都塔那那利佛举行了宣布独立的仪式。马尔加什总统齐腊纳纳和法国负责“共同体”国家关系的国务秘书让·弗瓦埃在约有十万人参加的仪式上分别用马尔加什语和法语宣读了独立声明，宣布马尔加什从26日起在“法兰西共同体”范围内独立。
    自从1896年法国殖民者侵入并宣布马尔加什为“法国属地”以来，那里的人民一直为反对法国殖民统治、争取祖国独立而英勇斗争。今年初，法国政府被迫同意让这个东非岛国在今年6月独立。但是，法国当局通过所谓确定马尔加什地位的文件，规定马尔加什在独立后仍应继续留在经过调整的“法兰西共同体”范围内。
