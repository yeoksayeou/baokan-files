Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th Dispatch: Leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and various circles today expressed their views on Chairman Mao Zedong's recent talks during his meeting with the Japanese literary delegation, thanking the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, and expressing their determination to fight to the end for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty."

Hakamada Satomi, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, expressed excitement regarding Chairman Mao Zedong's high evaluation that the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Japan. He pointed out that in the current struggle, the Japanese people have drawn great strength from the encouragement and support of China and other Asian and African countries. Hakamada pointed out that the Japanese people have realized through the recent struggle that U.S. imperialism is their real enemy. He said, "They understood this from the fact that the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries have united to attack the Japanese people, trying to impose an aggressive military alliance on their heads."

Hakamada pointed out that the Japanese people have declared that they do not recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which is a major blow to U.S. imperialism. He expressed that the Japanese people will resolutely fight for the final abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Sata Tadataka, Director of the International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that, as Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, the Socialist Party will continuously strengthen the unity of the Japanese people in the struggle to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," oppose U.S. military bases, and drive out the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism.

Sata Tadataka said that, in order to achieve these goals, the Socialist Party will concentrate its efforts on ensuring the strict implementation of the Constitution so that the new "Security Treaty," which violates the Constitution, will in effect become invalid.

Fujioka Mitsuo, Vice-Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, emphasized that, as Chairman Mao pointed out, the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is a mass struggle of the entire people against U.S. imperialism and its agents. He believes that the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" has made an important contribution to peace in Asia. Fujioka said, "However, we must emphasize that the workers must now strengthen their activities in rural areas and among ordinary citizens so that the Security Treaty will be reduced to a scrap of paper rejected by the entire Japanese people."

Hirano Yoshitaro, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said that Chairman Mao's talk greatly encouraged him. He said that this talk is a summary of the experience of the joint struggle of the Chinese and Japanese people against their common enemy. Hirano Yoshitaro said that what is particularly encouraging to the Japanese people is that Chairman Mao said that he does not believe that a great nation like Japan will be ruled by foreigners for a long time.

Hirano pointed out that the Japanese people have never demanded national independence as strongly as they do today. He said that the Chinese people not only support the Japanese people's anti-American struggle, but they themselves are also conducting a powerful struggle against U.S. imperialists. Hirano emphasized that only through this common struggle against a common enemy can true friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people be established.

Kawasaki Natsu, Chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Japan Mothers' Congress, said that the Japanese people fully understand what Chairman Mao said to the Japanese literary delegation, because these talks are based on the experience of the Chinese people who are determined to fight imperialism to the end.

    日各界领袖欢迎毛主席谈话
    感谢中国人民对日本人民反美爱国斗争的支持
    表示要为废除日美军事同盟条约坚决斗争到底
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党和各界领袖今天就毛泽东主席最近接见日本文学家代表团时的谈话发表意见，感谢中国人民对日本人民反美爱国斗争的支持，表示要为废除新“安全条约”而奋斗到底。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员袴田里见，对毛泽东主席关于日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争是反对美帝国主义及其在日本的代理人的斗争这一高度评价，表示兴奋。他指出，在当前的斗争中，日本人民从中国和其他亚非国家的鼓舞和支持中吸取到很大的力量。袴田指出，日本人民通过最近的斗争认识到美帝国主义是他们真正的敌人。他说，“从美帝国主义者和日本反动派联合起来向日本人民进攻、力图把侵略性军事同盟强加在他们头上的这个事实中，他们懂得了这一点”。
    袴田指出，日本人民已经宣布，他们不承认日美新“安全条约”，这是给美帝国主义一次很大的打击。他表示，日本人民将为最后废除新日美“安全条约”而坚决斗争。
    日本社会党国际局局长佐多忠隆说，正如毛泽东主席所指出的那样，社会党人将在废除新日美“安全条约”，反对美国军事基地和赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的斗争中，不断加强日本人民的团结。
    佐多忠隆说，为了实现这些目标，社会党将集中力量来使宪法得到严格的执行，以便使违反宪法的新“安全条约”实际上变得无效。
    日本工会总评议会副议长藤冈三男强调说，如毛主席所指出的，反对新“安全条约”的斗争是对美帝国主义及其代理人进行全民性的群众斗争。他认为，日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争，对亚洲和平作出了重要的贡献。藤冈说，“但是，我们必须强调，工人们现在必须加强他们在农村地区和普通市民中间的活动，以便使安全条约沦为被全体日本人民所拒绝的废纸。”
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎说，毛主席的谈话使他受到很大的鼓舞。他说，这次谈话是对日中两国人民同他们的共同敌人进行共同斗争的经验总结。平野义太郎说，特别使日本人民感到鼓舞的是，毛主席说他不相信像日本这样伟大的民族会长期受外国人统治。
    平野指出，日本人民从来没有像今天这样强烈地要求民族独立。他说，中国人民不仅支持日本人民的反美斗争，同时他们自己也在同美帝国主义者进行强有力的斗争。平野强调说，只有通过这种反对共同敌人的共同斗争，才能建立日中两国人民之间的真正友谊。
    日本母亲大会联络委员会主席河崎夏说，日本人民完全理解毛主席对日本文学家代表团所说的话，因为这些谈话是以同帝国主义斗争到底的中国人民的经验为基础的。
