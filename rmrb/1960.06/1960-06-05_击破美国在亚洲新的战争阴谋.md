　　The so-called eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, convened by the United States with some of its lackeys in Washington, has concluded. This aggressive bloc held its meeting for the first time in Washington, the base of world reactionary and aggressive forces. The "Southeast Asia" Treaty Organization holds a meeting in Washington; this fact alone is enough to illustrate the entire essence of this military group.

　　The American propaganda machine touted this Washington meeting as the "most important" meeting in the six years since the establishment of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. It is logical that American imperialism attaches such importance to this meeting. First, after destroying the four-power summit, American imperialism is taking advantage of the tension it created to intensify its arms expansion and war preparations around the world; second, the wave of opposition to American imperialism and its lackeys is rising in Asia, and American imperialism urgently needs to stabilize its position in the Far East in preparation for new aggression. Therefore, at the opening of this meeting, Eisenhower held a special reception to cheer up the servants of this aggressive bloc. During the meeting, Nixon and Herter personally made arrangements. The Washington meeting was carried out in an atmosphere full of gunpowder from beginning to end.

　　The final communique issued by the Washington meeting repeated the old robber logic of American imperialism, reversing black and white to blame the Soviet Union, which opposes American aggression, for destroying the four-power summit. Nixon, the American vice president who once openly clamored that "the Western countries cannot accept what the Soviets call peaceful coexistence" and insisted that the U.S. sending planes to invade the Soviet Union was "necessary," actually began to regret the four-power summit at the Washington meeting, saying that this meeting "could have solved some basic problems threatening world peace." Isn't this hypocritical tone of the American aggressors disgusting? In fact, Nixon and his ilk, as loyal representatives of the Wall Street monopoly capitalist group, know better than anyone that the purpose of the U.S. government's burial of the four-power summit is to further intensify world tensions and continue to pursue its policies of aggression and war. It is certainly no accident that American imperialism has gathered the servants of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to plot to intensify the tension in the Far East this time.

　　While American imperialism has recently stirred up war hysteria around the world, it has particularly spread war hysteria in the Far East and carried out a series of war preparations. The Washington meeting opened amidst loud war drums. Some time ago, U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker and Army Chief of Staff Lemnitzer revealed in their testimony before the U.S. Congress that the U.S. military had long drawn up a "general plan for waging war in Southeast Asia." U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Sharp openly threatened that the U.S. and its "allies" in the Far East were "ready" and "have been on alert." Before this meeting, the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc also held a military advisory meeting to decide to further expand the military planning agency in Bangkok and "review" their war plans. At the same time, the United States announced that it would send 120 supersonic fighters to the Far East for exercises. American news agencies also revealed that the United States will provide Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states with "things like new missiles." In this conspiracy in Washington, according to Japan's Kyodo News, the new Japan-U.S. "security treaty is regarded as" the "central axis" of the war system established by the United States in the Far East and is the "focus of this discussion." It is quite obvious that the war planners in Washington, in addition to using the Southeast Asia military group to step up their aggressive activities, are using the Japanese militarist aggressive forces as the backbone to closely link the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with this aggressive bloc in order to implement the "Southeast Asia war plan" mentioned above.

　　The Washington meeting further demonstrated that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for American imperialism to suppress national independence movements in Asia. At this meeting, from Nixon to U.S. General Felt and the American propaganda machine, they were all clamoring about the "deteriorating situation in Laos" and the Communist Party's "threat" to South Vietnam and Laos. The final communique of the Washington meeting also threatened to "pay special attention to" "the intensification of subversion, rebellion and terrorist activities by the Communist Party in several countries in the treaty area." Thailand's Sarasin admitted without concealment that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc meeting "paid special attention" to Laos and South Vietnam. All these clamors show that American imperialism is actively preparing to openly suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the people of Laos, South Vietnam, and various countries in the Far East. This cannot but arouse serious vigilance among the people of Southeast Asian countries.

　　This Washington meeting of the Southeast Asia bloc showed frantic hostility towards the Chinese people and tried its best to plot new anti-China conspiracies. In order to cover up its hateful aggressive face, American imperialism really cannot find a brilliant way, so it has to resort to anti-China propaganda, clamoring that Southeast Asia is facing a "threat from Communist China." In recent days, the American propaganda machine has worked even harder to attack New China. Nixon and Herter also wantonly slandered the Chinese people for carrying out "aggression" at the Washington meeting, saying that New China "wants war, not peace." At the same time, the United States is doing its best to create tension in the Taiwan Strait. Ignoring the repeated warnings of the Chinese government, it has more frequently sent planes and warships to intrude into China's airspace and territorial waters for military provocations. The Western propaganda machine does not shy away from saying that the United States Air Force's 120 aircraft will soon conduct large-scale exercises in Southeast Asia, which is aimed at New China. Immediately following the Washington meeting of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, Eisenhower will begin his trip to the Far East. Eisenhower has announced that he will go to Chiang Kai-shek's group. The American propaganda machine claims that this is to enhance the so-called "international prestige" of the Chiang Kai-shek group and "boost" the "morale" of the Chiang bandits, and also clamors that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group will mobilize the "maximum naval and air patrol force" to carry out provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait, and the Seventh Fleet will also be "on high alert." If Eisenhower was still wearing a false cloak of peace to confuse people during his last trip to eleven countries, then now people can see that this head of American imperialism has completely exposed his hideous face of hostility towards the Chinese people and the Asian people.

　　Everyone who is not biased can see who is carrying out aggression and threats in the Far East, who is plotting war and undermining peace, is it American imperialism or China? China has not stationed a single soldier in any other country, nor has it established a military base in any country. However, the United States has come from afar and distributed about 390,000 army, navy, and air force personnel in the Far East and the Western Pacific region, especially in Japan, South Korea, and the Chinese territory of Taiwan; it has established hundreds of military bases and missile bases in many countries and regions around China; it has two large fleets stationed in the Pacific, of which the Seventh Fleet has been carrying out war threats against China in the Taiwan Strait for a long time; since September 1958, American planes and warships have intruded into China's airspace and territorial waters as many as 162 times. As for the "subversion and threat" to Asian countries, where does it come from? It is precisely the United States and its sinister tool, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, which are trying their best to subvert the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It is precisely the United States that arbitrarily interferes in the internal affairs of Laos and Vietnam, instructs its lackeys to tear up the Geneva Accords, and threatens peace in Indochina. These are ironclad facts that cannot be concealed by any means. However, American imperialism insists on nonsense that the purpose of the United States is to "safeguard" the "freedom" and "security" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, and to help their "economic development." However, let the facts expose the ghost talk of American imperialism, let the people of Japan, South Korea, and Turkey who are fighting against American imperialism and its lackeys expose the lies of these liars. What American imperialism has brought to the people of all countries is the Lee Seung-man style, the Menderes style, and the Kishi Nobusuke style of "freedom," the mass graves in Turkey, the massacres in South Korean villages, and the Fu Loi concentration camp massacres in South Vietnam. Strangely, when Eisenhower, Nixon, and Herter are talking about the "freedom" bestowed by the United States, why don't they dare to mention a word about what is happening in Japan, South Korea, and Turkey?

　　American imperialism's further plotting of war conspiracies through the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and its stepping up of aggression against Asian countries is a new provocation against the Asian people! The Asian people need to be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen unity, persist in struggle, and defeat the new war conspiracy of the United States.

### 击破美国在亚洲新的战争阴谋

    击破美国在亚洲新的战争阴谋
    美国召集它的一部分喽罗们在华盛顿举行的所谓东南亚条约组织八国外长会议，已经收场了。这个侵略集团第一次在全世界反动和侵略势力的大本营——华盛顿举行会议。名为“东南亚”条约组织，而在华盛顿召开会议，仅仅这一个事实，就足以说明这个军事集团的全部本质。
    美国的宣传机器把这次华盛顿会议吹嘘为东南亚侵略集团成立六年来的“最重要”的一次会议。美帝国主义对这次会议这样重视，是合乎逻辑的。美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议以后，利用它一手造成的紧张局势，在世界各地加紧扩军备战，此其一；亚洲地区反对美帝国主义及其走狗的浪潮日益高涨，美帝国主义急需稳定它在远东的阵脚，以准备进行新的侵略，此其二。因此，在这次会议召开时，艾森豪威尔特别举行了招待会，为这个侵略集团的仆从们打气。在会议进行过程中，尼克松和赫脱又亲自作部署。华盛顿会议自始至终是在充满火药味的气氛中进行的。
    华盛顿会议所发表的最后公报，重复了美帝国主义的老一套的强盗逻辑，颠倒黑白地把破坏四国首脑会议的罪责倒栽在反对美国侵略的苏联身上。那个曾经公开叫嚷“西方国家不能接受苏联人所谓的和平共处”，并且坚持美国派飞机去侵犯苏联的行为是“有必要”的美国副总统尼克松，居然在华盛顿会议上替四国首脑会议惋惜起来，说什么这次会议“本来可以解决威胁世界和平的一些基本问题”。美国侵略者的这种猫哭耗子的假慈悲的腔调，难道还不令人作呕吗？其实，作为华尔街垄断资本集团的忠实代表的尼克松之流比谁都了解，美国政府一手埋葬四国首脑会议的目的，就在于进一步加剧世界紧张局势，继续推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。美帝国主义这次纠集东南亚侵略集团的仆从们策划加剧远东紧张局势的罪恶活动，当然不是偶然的事情。
    美帝国主义最近在世界各地煽起战争歇斯底里的同时，特别在远东散布战争歇斯底里，并且进行了一系列的备战活动。华盛顿会议就是在大擂战鼓中开场的。前些时候，美国陆军部长布鲁克和陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔在美国国会作证时就曾透露过，美国军方早就拟订好了“在东南亚进行战争的总计划”。美国空军部长夏普公然威胁说，美国和它的“盟国”在远东的空军已经“准备就绪”，而且“一直处于戒备状态”。在这次会议之前，东南亚侵略集团还举行了军事顾问会议，决定进一步扩大设在曼谷的军事计划机构，“审查”了他们的战争计划。与此同时，美国宣布即将派遣一百二十架超音速战斗机到远东举行演习。美国的通讯社还透露，美国将向东南亚条约组织成员国提供“包括像新式导弹这样的东西”。而在这次华盛顿的密谋中，据日本共同社说，新日美“安全条约被看作是”美国在远东建立的战争体制的“中枢”，并且是“这次讨论的中心”。十分明显，华盛顿的战争策划者们除了利用东南亚军事集团来加紧进行侵略活动以外，正在以日本军国主义侵略势力为骨干，使日美军事同盟条约与这个侵略集团紧密地联结起来，以执行上面提到的“东南亚作战计划”。
    华盛顿会议进一步表明，东南亚条约组织是美帝国主义在亚洲镇压民族独立运动的工具。在这次会议上，从尼克松到美国将军费耳特以及美国的宣传机器，都在大肆叫嚣“老挝局势恶化”、共产党“威胁”南越和老挝。华盛顿会议的最后公报并且扬言要“特别注意”
  “共产党在条约地区几个国家内的颠复、叛乱和恐怖活动的加紧”。泰国的沙拉信直认不讳地说，东南亚侵略集团会议“特别注意”老挝和南越。所有这些叫嚣说明了美帝国主义正在积极准备着对老挝、南越和远东各国人民的爱国正义斗争实行明目张胆的镇压。这不能不引起东南亚各国人民的严重警惕。
    这次东南亚集团的华盛顿会议，对于中国人民表现了疯狂敌视，竭力策划新的反华阴谋。美帝国主义为了掩盖它那副可憎的侵略面目，实在找不到高明的办法，只好乞灵于反华宣传，叫喊什么东南亚面临“来自共产党中国的威胁”。这几天来，美帝国主义的宣传机器，更加卖力地攻击新中国。尼克松和赫脱也在华盛顿会议上大肆诬蔑中国人民进行“侵略”，说什么新中国“要战争，不要和平”。与此同时，美国在台湾海峡竭力制造紧张局势，不顾中国政府的一再警告，更加频繁地派遣飞机和军舰侵入中国领空和领海，进行军事挑衅。西方的宣传机器毫不讳言，美国空军一百二十架飞机即将在东南亚进行大规模的演习，就是针对新中国的。紧接着东南亚侵略集团的华盛顿会议之后，艾森豪威尔将要开始他的远东之行。艾森豪威尔已经宣布，将要到蒋介石集团那里去。美国宣传机器扬言这是为了提高蒋介石集团的什么“国际威望”，“助长”蒋匪军的“士气”，并且还叫嚷美国和蒋介石集团要动员“最大海空巡逻力量”在台湾海峡进行挑衅活动，第七舰队也将“处于高度戒备状态”。如果说艾森豪威尔在上次十一国之行的时候还披着假和平的外衣来迷惑人的话，那末，现在人们可以看到，这个美帝国主义的头子，已经完全暴露出了他敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的狰狞面目。
    一切不持偏见的人都能看清，在远东究竟是谁在进行侵略和威胁，谁在策划战争、破坏和平，是美帝国主义还是中国？中国没有在任何别的国家驻有一兵一卒，没有在任何一个国家设有一个军事基地。而美国却不远万里而来，在远东和西太平洋地区分布了陆海空军约三十九万人，特别是在日本、南朝鲜和中国领土台湾驻有武装部队；在中国周围的许多国家和地区建立了上百个军事基地和导弹基地；在太平洋驻有两个庞大的舰队，其中第七舰队长期在台湾海峡对中国实行战争威胁；美国飞机和军舰从1958年9月以来，侵犯中国领空领海达一百六十二次之多。至于说到对亚洲各国的“颠复和威胁”，又来自哪里呢？正是美国和它的罪恶的工具东南亚条约组织成员国千方百计对柬埔寨王国政府进行颠复活动。也正是美国恣意干涉老挝和越南的内政，指使它的走狗撕毁日内瓦协议和威胁印度支那和平。这些都是铁一般的事实，是任何办法也掩盖不了的。而美帝国主义却偏偏要胡扯什么美国的目的是要“维护”东南亚条约成员国的什么“自由”和
  “安全”，是为了帮助它们的“经济发展”。但是，让事实来揭穿美帝国主义的鬼话吧，让正在进行着反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民来揭穿这些骗子手的谎言吧。美帝国主义给各国人民带来的就是李承晚式、曼德列斯式和岸信介式的“自由”，就是土耳其的万人坑、南朝鲜村庄里的集体大屠杀、南越富利集中营惨杀案。奇怪得很，艾森豪威尔、尼克松和赫脱在大谈美国恩赐的“自由”的时候，怎么对日本、南朝鲜和土耳其正在发生的事情连一个字也不敢提呢？
    美帝国主义通过东南亚侵略集团进一步策划战争阴谋和加紧对亚洲各国进行侵略活动，是对亚洲人民的一次新的挑衅！亚洲人民需要百倍地提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，挫败美国的新的战争阴谋。
