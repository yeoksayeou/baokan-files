Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 20th: According to a report by Japan's Jiji Press today, the traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi wrote another letter to Eisenhower on the 18th, abjectly apologizing to his American master once again for Eisenhower's forced postponement of his "visit" to Japan.

The news agency, citing "government sources," revealed that Kishi Nobusuke expressed his "deepest apologies" to Eisenhower in the letter and "explained in detail" the reasons why he was forced to request Eisenhower to postpone his "visit" to Japan.

In order to show his loyalty to the U.S. imperialists, Kishi Nobusuke specifically assured his American master in the letter: "The current turmoil in the (Japanese) political situation cannot and will not affect the consolidated friendship between Japan and the United States."

The day before writing this letter, Kishi Nobusuke personally met with the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, and apologized to the American master.

    新华社20日讯　东京消息：据日本时事通讯社今天报道，日本卖国首相岸信介在18日又写了一封信给艾森豪威尔，奴颜卑膝地就艾森豪威尔被迫延期“访问”日本一事再次向他的美国主子赔罪。
    这家通讯社援引“政府人士”透露的消息说，岸信介在这封信中向艾森豪威尔表示了“深深的歉意”，并且“详细地解释了”他被迫要求艾森豪威尔延期“访问”日本的原委。
    岸信介为了表示他对美帝国主义者忠心，在信中特别向美国主子保证：“目前（日本）政局的混乱不能也不会影响现在日本同美国之间的巩固的友谊”。
    岸信介在写这封信的前一天曾经亲自会见美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二，当局向美国主子赔了罪。
