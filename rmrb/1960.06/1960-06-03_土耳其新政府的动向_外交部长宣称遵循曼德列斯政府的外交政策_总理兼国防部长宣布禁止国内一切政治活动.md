Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd, Ankara Dispatch: Leaders of the government formed after the Turkish coup have made statements in recent days regarding the new government's domestic and foreign policies.

Foreign Minister Saper stated at a press conference on June 1st that the new government would not change the foreign policy of the former Menderes government and would "continue to be loyal" to NATO and CENTO. He said that there was no question of Turkey becoming a neutral country. Regarding the use of military bases in Turkey by American aircraft, he said that according to the U.S.-Turkey bilateral military agreements and other agreements, the United States' use of Turkish bases was part of Turkey's obligations. "We abide by these agreements."

Regarding domestic policy, Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Gursel had previously announced a ban on all political activities until the new constitution took effect. The government had announced the establishment of a special committee to formulate a new constitution and hold new parliamentary elections. The new government has banned public demonstrations and has deployed troops to prevent demonstrations by the people of the capital, Ankara. According to a spokesman for the "National Unity Committee," formed after the coup, the new cabinet would be responsible to the "National Unity Committee," composed of the officers who launched the coup.

The Turkish coup was launched against the background of the Turkish people's unbearable and successive large-scale demonstrations against Menderes' traitorous and dictatorial rule for about a month. After taking office, the new government announced the arrest of former government members and members of Menderes' Democratic Party.

The leader of the main opposition party of the original Menderes government, the Republican People's Party, and former President Inonu held a long meeting with army leaders on the day of the coup. At a press conference on June 1st, he said that he supported the coup and announced that he would participate in the new elections. If his party wins, it "will inherit the foreign policy of the previous government." The United States and Britain quickly recognized Gursel's new government and expressed satisfaction with the new government. The U.S. State Department spokesman particularly emphasized that the new Turkish government had announced that it would fulfill all obligations to participate in military blocs. The "New York Times," the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, said: "The initial statements of the new rulers are very reassuring on all issues of domestic and foreign policy."

    土耳其新政府的动向
    外交部长宣称遵循曼德列斯政府的外交政策
    总理兼国防部长宣布禁止国内一切政治活动
    新华社2日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其政变后成立的政府领导人几天来就新政府的内政外交政策发表了声明。
    新政府外交部长萨佩尔1日在记者招待会上说，新政府不改变前曼德列斯政府的外交政策，将“继续忠于”北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织。他说，并不存在土耳其成为中立国家的任何问题。关于美国飞机利用它在土耳其的军事基地，他说，根据美土双边军事协定和其他协定，美国使用土耳其的基地，是土耳其承担的义务的一部分。“我们遵守这些协定”。
    关于对内政策，在这以前，新政府总理兼国防部长古尔塞勒宣布禁止一切政治活动，直到新宪法生效为止。政府曾宣布已成立一个特别委员会，以便制订新宪法，并举行新议会选举。新政府禁止人民示威集会，并曾出动军队阻止首都安卡拉人民示威。据政变后成立的“全国团结委员会”发言人宣布，新内阁要由对发动政变的军官组成的“全国团结委员会”负责。
    土耳其这次政变是在土耳其人民对曼德列斯卖国独裁统治忍无可忍，举行了约一个月的前仆后继的大规模示威的背景下发动的。新政府上台后就宣布逮捕了前政府成员和曼德列斯的民主党的议员。
    原曼德列斯政府的主要反对党——共和人民党领袖、前总统伊诺努在政变的当天曾经和陆军领袖举行了长时间的会谈。他在6月1日举行的记者招待会上说，他赞成这次政变，并宣布他将参加新选举。他的党如获胜，“将继承前政府的外交政策”。美国和英国很快就承认了古尔塞勒的新政府，对新政府表示满意。美国国务院发言人特别强调土耳其新政府已宣布将履行参加军事集团的一切义务。美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”说：“新统治者们最初的一些声明在内政外交政策的一切问题上都使人感到十分放心”。
