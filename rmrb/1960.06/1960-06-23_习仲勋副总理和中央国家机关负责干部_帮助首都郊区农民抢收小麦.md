Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Over 50,000 cadres from central government organs, workers, students, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in the capital have been helping the people's communes in the suburbs to rush harvest wheat in recent days. This contingent supporting the wheat harvest is full of energy, with everyone striving to be first in the rush harvest, which has been warmly welcomed by the commune members.

This year, the wheat planting area in the suburbs of Beijing has expanded by 200,000 mu compared to last year, making the wheat harvesting task more arduous than in previous years. To help the communes harvest the wheat in a timely manner, the central and Beijing municipal organs, factories, and mining enterprises have all drawn a large number of people to the countryside to support the rush harvest after adjusting labor organization and properly arranging work and production. Many factories have also organized repair teams to travel to various communes to repair wheat harvesting machinery. All units regard this labor as a good opportunity to go deep into the grassroots and engage in labor training. The Ministry of Agricultural Machinery has properly arranged its work, transferred some cadres to the countryside, and brought seven harvesters, tractors, and a trailer used for testing by the unit to participate in the wheat harvest. In addition to those participating in voluntary labor, staff from Beijing universities and scientific research institutions also support the summer harvest in various ways based on their professional expertise. Commercial and medical departments have organized sales groups and field medical teams, active on the front lines of the wheat harvest.

More than 170 cadres at the bureau-level and above from various ministries and commissions of the central government, led by Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, went to the Hongxing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing on the 21st to harvest wheat with the commune members. Those who participated in this labor included Xie Fuzhi, Song Renqiong, Ma Wenrui, Li Dequan, Jiang Guangnai, Cheng Zihua, and other heads of various ministries and commissions. Before today, many leaders of ministries and commissions had already gone to the suburbs with their unit's cadres to participate in the wheat harvest.

Since the beginning of the wheat harvest, leading cadres at all levels in Beijing have come to the front lines of production to participate in labor and direct production. Zheng Tianxiang and Chen Peng, Secretaries of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as leading comrades from various departments and commissions of the Municipal Committee, have successively gone to Chaoyang, Hongxing, and other communes to work alongside the commune members. The First Secretaries of each district (county) party committee have also gone to areas with heavy wheat harvesting tasks to personally direct and resolve problems on the spot.

    帮助首都郊区农民抢收小麦
    新华社22日讯　首都的机关干部、工人、学生、部队官兵五万多人，连日帮助郊区人民公社抢收小麦。这支支援麦收的队伍，干劲十足，在抢收中人人争先恐后，受到社员热烈欢迎。
    今年北京郊区小麦播种面积比去年扩大了二十万亩，收麦任务比往年繁重。为了帮助公社把小麦及时收割到家，中央和北京市各机关、各厂矿企业，在调整了劳动组织，妥善安排了工作、生产之后，都抽出大批人力下乡，支援抢收。很多工厂还组织抢修队，到各公社巡回检修收麦机具。各单位都把这次劳动作为深入基层、劳动锻炼的好机会。农业机械部妥善安排了工作，抽调一部分干部下乡，并且带去了本单位试验用的七台收割机、拖拉机和一辆拖车参加麦收。北京高等院校、科学研究机关的工作人员除参加义务劳动的人以外，还根据本身业务特长，从各方面支援夏收。商业、医务部门组织售货组、田间医疗队，活跃在麦收最前线。
    中央国家机关各部委司、局长以上干部一百七十多人，在习仲勋副总理率领下，21日到北京郊区红星人民公社和社员一起收麦。参加这次劳动的有谢富治、宋任穷、马文瑞、李德全、蒋光鼐、程子华等各部、委的负责人。在今天以前，还有不少部、委领导人已经和本单位干部一起到郊区参加收麦。
    开始麦收以来，北京市各级领导干部纷纷亲临生产第一线，参加劳动，指挥生产。中共北京市委书记处书记郑天翔、陈鹏以及市委各部、委领导同志先后到朝阳、红星等公社和社员一起劳动。各区（县）委第一书记也都到收麦任务重的地区亲自指挥，就地解决问题。（附图片）
