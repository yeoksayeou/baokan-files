Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and forwarded it to the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, saying, "Chinese workers feel boundless indignation at the fascist atrocities of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in massacring Japanese patriotic students, express deep condolences to the Japanese patriotic students who were killed, and express cordial sympathy to the families of the martyrs and the Japanese patriotic students who were wounded and their families.
	“The blood of Japanese patriotic students most forcefully exposes the hideous face of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries as enemies of the broad masses of the Japanese people. At the same time, it clearly points out that the Japanese people must resolutely struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to the end.
	“Japanese workers and people will never let the blood of Japanese patriotic students be shed in vain. They will transform grief and indignation into strength and set off a larger-scale and more resolute anti-American patriotic struggle to crush the bloody rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. In this struggle, Chinese workers and the people of the whole country will always stand with the Japanese workers and the Japanese people.”
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty of Japan and forwarded it to various Japanese youth and student organizations, saying,
	“The 130 million youth and students of China resolutely support your second general strike and class boycott struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, against the visit to Japan by the number one U.S. imperialist war monger Eisenhower, and against Kishi Nobusuke, the running dog of U.S. imperialism. We warmly hail the great victory you have achieved in this just struggle. Chinese youth will always stand with you.
	"The anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and youth and students against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has severely hit the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Eisenhower's visit to Japan is to support his running dog, the tottering Nobusuke Kishi traitorous and reactionary clique, in a vain attempt to impose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which the Japanese people vow to oppose, on the Japanese people, and to plot new military adventures in the Far East. The Japanese people and Japanese youth and students have launched an indomitable and heroic struggle against Eisenhower's sinful actions, which is completely just, necessary, and a great contribution to the cause of world peace. The Japanese people's iron fists of anger will surely drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan!
	“The Nobusuke Kishi reactionary government, a traitor to the country, has committed heinous crimes by carrying out bloody suppression of patriotic students and righteous people. Chinese youth and students express boundless indignation and strong condemnation for this. We express our deep condolences to the students who died or were injured in the struggle and to their families, and extend our cordial sympathy.
	“Dear Japanese youth friends! Turn grief and indignation into strength. Unite more closely with the people of the whole country, make persistent efforts, advance bravely, struggle resolutely, and final victory will surely belong to you."
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations and forwarded it to the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, saying, "Having learned that the Nobusuke Kishi government has resorted to all means to order armed police and buy off a large number of fascist bandits to attack Japanese demonstrators, killing and wounding nearly 300 demonstrating students and people, including a large number of female students and women, causing a serious bloody tragedy, Chinese women feel boundless anger about this. We express our deep condolences to the victims of this bloodshed and their relatives, and extend our sincere sympathy to the injured.
	“The appalling tragedy created by Kishi Nobusuke against unarmed demonstrators was to clear the way for his master Eisenhower, to suppress the surging tide of the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which once again exposed the fascist face of Kishi Nobusuke, the running dog of U.S. imperialism. Eisenhower's visit to Japan is to support the tottering Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government, to force through the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and to carry out a series of military deployments to tie Japan tightly to the U.S. war chariot. However, the Japanese people and women who have been tempered by eighteen unified actions and are increasingly closely united will never be intimidated by any violence. Bloody suppression will further arouse the anger and fighting spirit of the Japanese people and Japanese women. The Japanese people and women will surely crush the suppression and all conspiracies and tricks of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. They will surely step on the blood of the victims, continue to advance bravely, and give the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries an even greater blow. The Chinese people and Chinese women vow to be the backing of the Japanese brothers and sisters."
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace today sent a telegram to the Japanese Peace Committee, condemning the Nobusuke Kishi group for carrying out bloody suppression of the Japanese people's just struggle under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, and expressed resolute support for the Japanese people's struggle to the end.
	The telegram said, "We would like to express our highest respect to the Japanese people who are launching an increasingly powerful nationwide movement and have victoriously carried out their second general strike and powerful parades and demonstrations to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and Eisenhower's visit to Japan.
	“The reactionary Nobusuke Kishi group, in order to welcome its master Eisenhower to Japan to plot war conspiracies, brazenly carried out bloody suppression of the Japanese people's just struggle, dispatching armed police and buying fascist thugs to massacre demonstrating patriotic masses and students, which once again reveals the heinous face of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries headed by Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke. The Chinese people feel boundless indignation at this bloody atrocity of Kishi Nobusuke under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. We express our heartfelt condolences to the victims and our sincere sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured.
	"The Japanese people's just struggle cannot be stopped or undermined by any suppressive means or conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Asia to plot new war conspiracies and opposition to the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is the common task of the Chinese and Japanese people and the people of all Asian countries. The Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's heroic patriotic and just struggle to the end. We believe that the Japanese people will more tenaciously persevere in the struggle, give the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries greater and heavier blows, until final victory is achieved."
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity today sent a telegram to the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, condemning the Nobusuke Kishi group for carrying out bloody suppression and massacres of the Japanese people's just struggle under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.
	The telegram said, "We express our great anger at the bloody suppression and massacre of demonstrators and patriotic students opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty by the Nobusuke Kishi government under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. We express our heartfelt condolences to the heroic martyrs and extend our sincere sympathy to the injured and the families of the victims.
	"Although the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have adopted fascist and brutal means to suppress the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan to plot war, the Japanese people's anger cannot be stopped by any force. Yesterday, the general strike of 5.8 million people and powerful demonstrations were a strong response to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The 650 million people of China are watching and fully supporting the Japanese people's struggle. The power of the united people is enormous, and we believe that the Japanese people's persistent and resolute struggle will continue to achieve new victories."

    我全国总工会、青联、学联、妇联等致电日本各团体
    中国人民谴责岸信介集团法西斯暴行
    坚决支持日本人民反美爱国斗争到底
    新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本工会总评议会并转阻止修改安全条约国民会议说，“中国工人对美日反动派屠杀日本爱国学生的法西斯暴行感到无比的愤慨，对被杀害的日本爱国学生致以沉痛的悼念，对死难烈士的家属和被打伤的日本爱国学生及其家属表示亲切慰问。
    “日本爱国学生的鲜血，最有力地揭穿了美日反动派和日本广大人民为敌的狰狞面目。同时明确地指出日本人民必须坚决对美日反动派斗争到底。
    “日本工人和人民决不会让日本爱国学生的鲜血白流，必将化悲愤为力量，为粉碎日美军事同盟条约而掀起更大规模的、更坚决的反美爱国斗争的巨浪，直到冲垮美日反动派的血腥统治。在这场斗争中，中国工人和全国人民永远站在日本工人和日本人民一边。”
    新华社16日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天致电日本阻止修改安全条约国民会议并转日本各青年学生团体说，
  “全中国一亿三千万青年和学生坚决支持你们为反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美帝国主义头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔访问日本、反对美帝国主义的走狗岸信介而举行的第二次总罢工、罢课斗争。我们热烈地欢呼你们在这一正义斗争中取得的巨大胜利。中国青年永远和你们站在一起。
    日本人民和青年学生反对日美军事同盟条约的反美爱国正义斗争，沉重地打击了美日反动派。艾森豪威尔访问日本是为它的走狗、摇摇欲坠的岸信介卖国反动集团撑腰，妄图把日本人民誓死反对的日美军事同盟条约强加在日本人民的头上，并策划在远东实行新的军事冒险阴谋。日本人民和日本的青年、学生针对着艾森豪威尔这一罪恶的行动展开反美反岸的不屈不挠的英勇斗争，这是完全正义的、必要的，是对世界和平事业的巨大贡献。日本人民愤怒的铁拳必将把美帝国主义从日本赶出去！
    “卖国奴的岸信介反动政府对爱国的学生、正义的人民进行血腥镇压，犯了滔天罪行，中国青年和学生对此表示无比愤慨和强烈的谴责。我们对于在斗争中死伤的同学和他们的家属致沉痛的哀悼和亲切的慰问。
    “亲爱的日本青年朋友们！化悲愤为力量。更紧密地和全国人民团结在一起，再接再厉，勇往直前，坚决斗争，最后胜利一定属于你们。”
    新华社16日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天致电日本妇女团体联合会并转阻止修改安全条约国民会议说，“闻悉岸信介政府竟不择手段地指令武装警察并收买大批法西斯匪徒向日本示威群众进攻，打死和打伤近三百名示威学生和群众，其中包括大批女学生和妇女，造成了严重的流血惨案，中国妇女对此感到无比的愤怒，我们特向这次流血事件的死难者和他们的亲属表示沉痛的哀悼，向受伤者致以深切的慰问。
    “岸信介对手无寸铁的示威群众制造的骇人听闻的大惨案，是为了替他的主子艾森豪威尔敲锣开道，是为了镇压日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约奔腾的怒潮，这就再一次暴露了美帝国主义走狗岸信介的法西斯面貌。艾森豪威尔访问日本是为了支持摇摇欲坠的岸信介反动政府，强迫通过日美军事同盟条约，并进行一系列的军事部署，把日本紧紧地绑在美国的战车上。但是经过了十八次统一行动锻炼的并且日益紧密地团结起来的日本人民和妇女绝不是任何暴力所能吓倒的，血腥镇压将会更加激起日本人民和日本妇女的怒火和斗志，日本人民和妇女一定会粉碎日美反动派的镇压和一切阴谋诡计，他们一定会踏着死难者的血迹，继续奋勇前进，给日美反动派以更大的打击。中国人民和中国妇女誓为日本兄弟姐妹们的后盾。”
    新华社16日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电日本和平委员会，谴责岸信介集团在美帝国主义指使下对日本人民的正义斗争进行血腥镇压，并且表示坚决支持日本人民斗争到底。
    电报说“我们谨向正在掀起声势日益浩大的全民性运动，为反对日美军事同盟条约、反对艾森豪威尔访日而胜利地进行了第二次总罢工和强大游行示威的日本人民，表示崇高的敬意。
    “倒行逆施的岸信介集团，为迎接它的主子艾森豪威尔到日本策划战争阴谋，竟悍然对日本人民的正义斗争进行血腥镇压，出动武装警察和收买法西斯暴徒屠杀示威的爱国群众和学生，这就再一次显露出以艾森豪威尔和岸信介为首的美日反动派的穷凶极恶的面目。中国人民对岸信介在美帝国主义指使下的这种血腥暴行，感到无比的愤慨。我们谨向死难者表示衷心的哀悼，对死难者家属及受伤者表示亲切的慰问。
    “日本人民的正义斗争是美日反动派用任何镇压手段和阴谋诡计所阻挡不住和破坏不了的。反对艾森豪威尔到亚洲策划新的战争阴谋，反对侵略性的日美军事同盟条约是中日两国人民、亚洲各国人民的共同任务。中国人民坚决支持日本人民英勇的爱国正义斗争到底。我们相信，日本人民一定会更加顽强地坚持斗争，给予美日反动派以更大更沉重的打击，直到取得最后胜利。”
    新华社16日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天致电日本亚非团结委员会，谴责岸信介集团在美帝国主义指使下，对日本人民的正义斗争进行血腥镇压和屠杀。
    电报说“我们对岸信介政府在美帝国主义指使下血腥镇压和屠杀反对日美军事同盟条约的示威群众和爱国学生，表示巨大的愤怒。谨向英勇牺牲者致以衷心的哀悼，向受伤者及受难者家属致以亲切慰问。
    “尽管美日反动派采取法西斯残暴手段，镇压日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、反对艾森豪威尔到日本策划战争的爱国正义斗争，但是，日本人民的怒火是任何力量也阻挡不住的。昨天，五百八十万人的总罢工和强大的示威游行，就是对美日反动派的强有力回答。中国六亿五千万人民都在注视和全力支持日本人民的斗争。团结起来的人民的力量是巨大无比的，我们相信，日本人民再接再厉的坚决斗争，必将不断获得新的胜利。”
