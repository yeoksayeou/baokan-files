Two Years of Overall Leap Forward
Representative of Tsinghua University, Gao Yi

I.

Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," Tsinghua University, inspired by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune Movement, has unswervingly implemented this policy under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central Government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Over the past two years, it has adhered to the struggle between the two lines on the issue of educational policy, insisted on vigorous mass movements, adhered to the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, and upheld the principle of combining professional labor with non-professional labor, and on-campus labor with off-campus labor. The work of the university has achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and the face of the university has undergone unprecedented changes.

The first ideological obstacle to implementing the Party's educational policy was the bourgeois educational tradition that looked down on productive labor. When Tsinghua University first embarked on the path of productive labor, it launched a fierce debate on "whether or not to get on the horse," criticizing the bourgeois view that opposed large-scale production in schools. Starting with participating in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in early 1958, all students and teachers participated in non-professional public welfare labor such as on- and off-campus water conservancy, greening, agricultural production, steel smelting, and basic construction. In two years, a total of more than 300,000 workdays were completed. On campus, teachers, students, and staff also produced a batch of products such as boiler-camel machines and machine tools to support the country's industrial and agricultural construction. On the basis of widely carrying out productive labor, we closely cooperated with the needs of socialist construction and carried out a large number of production designs, trial production, and scientific research on important topics in the national economy. In order to support the people's commune movement, we undertook the architectural planning and residential area design of people's communes in Xushui and other places. Teachers and students participated in civil construction labor together with commune members and trained civil construction design and construction forces for the local area. In addition, we supported the industrial construction of more than 50 counties and cities such as Dengfeng, Henan, helped the Yongfeng People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing to run industries, and established regular contact with these units. In terms of water conservancy, our school designed 17 reservoirs for Beijing, including the Miyun Reservoir, with a total storage capacity of 6.8 billion cubic meters. Many students and teachers also participated in labor at the reservoir construction site. Since 1958, in the fields of metallurgy, machinery, power, transportation, and the National Day projects in the capital, the university has completed more than 300 relatively important scientific research, design, trial production, and other production tasks. This year, in the upsurge of the national technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the school has also set off a new upsurge in productive labor, technical innovation, and technical revolution. According to statistics for the first four months of this year, about 6,000 people across the school directly cooperated with off-campus units to carry out relatively important technical innovations, technical revolutions, scientific research, and trial production of new products, and achieved many results.

The combination of education and productive labor not only enabled the school to directly contribute its strength to the country's economic construction, but also greatly improved the school's scientific level. Over the past two years, each department has grasped some research tasks with major national economic significance and high scientific level from production practice as its key research direction, continuously deepening and improving them. The central and Beijing municipal departments have successively organized more than 20 on-site meetings in our school to promote several important achievements of our school's scientific research. This year, with the national effort to promote technical innovation and technical revolution, many majors have gained new inspiration from the rich creations of the masses, and thus found many original research topics. At present, the vast majority of new technology majors in the school have been tested by actual production and scientific research, and have reached advanced levels at home and abroad in several important scientific and technological fields.

After large-scale productive labor and scientific research, major changes have also taken place in the relationship between the school and the outside world. The communist spirit of mutual assistance and mutual promotion has become the norm. Our school has established relatively regular contact with 559 factories, schools, research institutes, and people's communes spread across the vast majority of provinces and cities across the country. It is precisely by relying on extensive cooperation that the school can smoothly establish its own production and research bases and complete teaching, scientific research, and production tasks. Hundreds of people from our school go to factories, enterprises, and brother schools every day to "learn from experience," make contact for cooperation, and participate in production or work. On the other hand, hundreds of people from many off-campus units come to the school every day to request technical support, exchange experiences, visit, and negotiate cooperation. According to incomplete statistics for the first four months of this year, there were 9,100 units with 19,800 person-times. This shows that universities are playing an increasingly important role in production and construction and technical revolution.

The Party Central Committee pointed out in its instructions on education work: The future direction is for schools to run factories and farms, and for factories and agricultural cooperatives to run schools. Over the past two years, our school has established 15 factories and production workshops with considerable levels, greatly expanding and adding a large number of new laboratories. The school has begun to form a three-in-one base for teaching, production, and scientific research. Over the past two years, our school has self-made more than 3,000 sets of instruments and equipment, which can meet about 50% of the needs of teaching and scientific research in our school. Many of these self-made equipment cannot be bought with money. We produced and assembled these teaching instruments and equipment ourselves, which not only saved time and foreign exchange, but also trained people.

Although some people advocate that students participate in labor, they do not agree with schools establishing production bases. They believe that students only need to participate in labor off campus, which is obviously a "one-legged" approach. Facts fully prove that schools running factories facilitates a more regular and closer connection between productive labor and teaching, facilitates the systematic exploration of scientific research and trial production of new products, not only helps improve the quality of teaching in schools and strengthen ideological training, but also has profound significance for fundamentally transforming schools and accelerating the climbing of scientific peaks in Chinese universities. Insufficient understanding of the significance of schools establishing production bases also means insufficient understanding of the great significance of the Party's educational policy.

II.

The implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor has caused profound changes in the ideological outlook of the vast number of teachers and students at Tsinghua University.

The practice of productive labor has powerfully eliminated the bourgeois views of hating and despising physical labor and working people. In the past, some people promoted "physical labor is low-level, mental labor is high-level," "working people have big hands and small brains, and intellectuals have small hands and big brains." However, these "big brains" made many jokes in production practice, fully exposing their incompetence. The vast number of teachers and students worked together with workers and peasants, jointly conducted design and scientific research, understood that working people are the most experienced and smartest, that physical labor is the most valuable, and began to develop the habit of physical labor and establish a love of labor. Over the past two years, they have participated in various labors such as steel smelting, water conservancy construction, drought resistance, waterlogging drainage, rush harvesting and planting, afforestation and greening, and even sanitation, hairdressing, and cooking, both on and off campus, in factories and in rural areas, without fear of dirt or fatigue. As long as production needs it, they do everything. Students are workers when they go to factories and peasants when they go to rural areas. It is difficult to distinguish between workers, peasants, and college students in labor. Labor has changed the relationship between intellectuals and working people. Students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering used poetry to describe their love for labor:

The best poem is written by a lathe tool, the best song is sung by a motor,
The most beautiful clothes are worn by workers, the best smell is the smell of oily mud,
The greatest happiness is labor, the greatest is our beloved Party.

In labor, the vast number of teachers and students were inspired by the soaring enthusiasm of the working people, further strengthened their ideology of serving the working people and their communist ambition, and despised the bourgeois individualistic ideology that regarded knowledge as private property. In the technical revolution, they saw workers sweating by the hot furnace for heavy physical labor, understood the significance of the "second liberation" of the working class, and some students became innovation fanatics. They think about it while eating, using chopsticks as paintbrushes; they think about it while walking, sometimes hitting telephone poles; they think about it while riding in a car, even missing their stop; they think about it while sleeping, even jumping out of bed in the middle of the night. They are no longer obsessed with the life of "one room, two books, associate professor, small family," but with the "second liberation" of the working people. The ideal of students in the Department of Water Conservancy to build reservoirs is to "block the happy golden water and wash away the poverty of the people for generations." The ideal of students in the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture is to "build thousands of houses so that 600 million people can be happy." Everyone takes serving the working people as their ideal and creative labor as their ambition. Students in the Department of Water Conservancy use poetry to describe their drive:

I regard the earth as a bronze drum, knocking it to make mountains and rivers dance together,
I knock it hundreds of times today, and tomorrow it will generate billions of degrees of electricity.

Production practice has enlightened the vast number of masses to consciously study and apply dialectical materialism. After studying Chairman Mao's works, students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering used inferior soil to burn a lightweight, high-strength building material - ceramsite - in public welfare labor, and the "layman" overcame the cutting-edge technology of the expert. Now, in the school's teaching, production, and scientific research, learning and applying dialectical materialism has become the conscious demand of the vast number of masses, forming a trend of "everyone studying Chairman Mao and asking Chairman Mao for everything."

Due to the profound changes in the mental outlook of the vast number of masses, an unprecedentedly rich, colorful, and lively scene has appeared in school life. In accordance with the principle of "having labor and rest, having tension and relaxation" and Chairman Mao's instructions to young people to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work," we have vigorously carried out mass cultural, sports, and militia training activities. The vigorous development of these activities is also complementary to the school's education revolution, technological revolution, and ideological revolution, and they promote each other, and become an important part of the work of cultivating well-rounded communist new people.

III.

Those who oppose the Party's educational policy always say that schools engaged in production will reduce the quality of teaching, reduce the level of theory, and narrow the scope of knowledge. But the facts are just the opposite. The combination of education and productive labor has greatly promoted the great development and great improvement of theoretical teaching and theoretical research.

In order to meet the needs of production and scientific research, the content needed for the major and the latest scientific and technological knowledge have been universally increased in the teaching of basic theories, and it has also been appropriately combined with scientific research. Therefore, the learning content of students is wider and the level is higher. For example, first-year students in the Department of Engineering Mathematics and Mechanics undertook the calculation task of a certain project in conjunction with the study of advanced mathematics. According to the old method, the calculation method would be extremely complicated if only considered from mathematics. However, because the students had an in-depth understanding of the production process, they greatly simplified the original "mathematical equation" and quickly proposed a new method to calculate all the results. They later discovered that a "mysterious" solution touted in an American magazine was just a special case of the method created by the students. A mathematics teacher exclaimed: "I never thought that first-year students today could do things that we didn't dare to think about when we graduated from university."

In terms of professional courses, according to Mao Zedong Thought, we have summarized the creations of the vast number of working people in the Great Leap Forward, technical innovation, and technical revolution, critically absorbed the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, and conducted theoretical discussions and summaries, opening up new research directions. Over the past two years, we have compiled and published many papers and teaching reference materials based on summarizing the achievements of scientific research and exploring theory. All these research results have also greatly enriched and improved the teaching content.

Production practice and scientific research require the comprehensive application of scientific knowledge in various fields. Therefore, the combination of education and productive labor has greatly expanded the knowledge fields of teachers and students. People must first consider politics and economics when solving technical problems, engineering design must be linked to manufacturing, construction, and adjustment operations, and solving a problem in a certain subject must be linked to related other subjects. In this way, the narrow professional boundaries are broken, and students are gradually trained to become versatile people. For example, in order to manufacture computer-controlled automatic machine tools, teachers and students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering need to master mechanical manufacturing knowledge, but also need to learn motor and automatic control knowledge and the higher mathematics knowledge required for programming.

Speaking of higher education, the rightists in the past always tried their best to promote "the past is better than the present." Taking Tsinghua University as an example, whether in terms of teaching quality or scientific research, it should be said that the new Tsinghua far exceeds the old Tsinghua. Before liberation, the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University, for example, only designed a tricycle. Compared with the computer-controlled automatic machine tools that are now designed and manufactured successfully, how long a distance is the old Tsinghua from the new Tsinghua in terms of scientific and technological level! During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the old China built a total of only 12,000 kW of hydropower stations in 20 years (excluding the Northeast and Taiwan). Last year, our school designed hydropower stations with an installed capacity of 360,000 kW. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the progress of higher industrial education in our country has been very rapid. This is a great victory for the Party's educational policy! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought on education!

Now, the Party's leadership at Tsinghua University has been strengthened more than ever before. The vast number of teachers, students, and staff are determined to follow the Party and take the socialist road. A contingent of working-class intellectuals with young people as the backbone has grown rapidly.

Revolving around the three-in-one combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, the Party's mass line has also made new progress in school work. Taking graduation design as the "combination point" of the three-in-one, many teachers, students, and staff from different majors have formed a "large corps" of "multi-arms," and students from higher and lower grades have formed a "dragon" with front and rear connections to concentrate the strength of the masses and jointly solve major production and scientific research tasks. These organizational forms reflect the vivid picture of the mass line on the higher education front in our country. This kind of collective combat, mutual promotion, and vigorous mass movement that extensively mobilizes people's enthusiasm has also effectively cultivated people's collectivist spirit. It is far superior to the cold and lonely single-handedness of a few experts in the past.

Our future task is to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to vigorously implement the Party's educational policy, and continuously carry out ideological revolution, education revolution, and technical revolution, and bravely advance to build a communist Tsinghua University!

    全面跃进的两年
    清华大学代表　高沂
    一
    党中央提出了“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以后，清华大学在总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的鼓舞下，在中央教育部和中共北京市委的直接领导下，两年以来，坚定不移地贯彻执行了这个方针；坚持了在教育方针问题上的两条道路的斗争，坚持了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，坚持了教学、生产劳动和科学研究的三结合，坚持了专业性劳动与非专业性劳动、校内劳动和校外劳动并举的原则，学校的工作有了空前的大跃进，学校的面貌发生了空前的大变化。
    贯彻执行党的教育方针的第一个思想障碍，是那种轻视生产劳动的资产阶级教育传统。清华大学在开始跨上生产劳动之马的时候，曾经开展了一场“要不要上马”的激烈论争，批判了反对在学校大搞生产的资产阶级观点。从1958年初参加修建十三陵水库的劳动起，全校学生和教师参加了校内外水利、绿化、农业生产、大炼钢铁、基本建设等非专业性的公益劳动。两年内，共完成了三十多万个劳动日。在校内，还通过师生职工的双手，生产了一批锅驼机、机床等产品，支援了国家工农业建设。在广泛开展生产劳动的基础上，我们紧密地配合社会主义建设的需要，对国民经济中的重要课题进行了大量的生产设计、试制和科学研究工作。为了支援人民公社化运动，担负了徐水等地人民公社的建筑规划和居住区的设计工作，师生和社员一起参加了土建劳动，并为当地培养了土建设计施工的力量。此外，还支援了河南登封等五十多个县市的工业建设，帮助了京郊永丰人民公社兴办工业，并和这些单位建立了经常联系。在水利化运动方面，我校为北京市设计了包括密云水库在内的十七个水库，总库容达到六十八亿方。很多同学和教师还在水库工地参加了劳动。1958年以来，在冶金、机械、动力、交通运输、首都国庆工程等方面，全校共完成了三百多项比较重要的科学研究和设计试制等生产任务。今年，在全民的技术革新与技术革命运动的高潮中，学校也掀起了生产劳动、技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。据今年头四个月的统计，全校约有六千余人直接同校外单位合作，进行了比较重要的技术革新、技术革命和科学研究，以及新产品的试制工作，取得了不少成果。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，不仅使学校直接为国家的经济建设，贡献了自己的力量，同时也大大提高了学校的科学水平。两年来，各个系都从生产实践中，抓住了一些具有重大国民经济意义和较高科学水平的研究任务，作为自己的重点研究方向，不断深入，不断提高。中央和北京市有关部门曾先后在我校组织了二十多次现场会议，推广我校的科学研究的若干重要成果。今年全国大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，许多专业从广大群众的丰富创造中得到了新的启发，因而找到了很多独创性的研究课题。目前学校绝大多数新技术专业，都经过了实际生产和科学研究的考验，在若干重要的科学技术领域内，已经达到了国内外先进的水平。
    大搞生产劳动和科学研究以后，校内外的关系也发生了重大变化。互相帮助，互相促进的共产主义协作已成风气。我校已经与遍布在全国绝大多数省市的五百五十九个工厂、学校、研究所和人民公社，建立了比较经常的联系。学校正是依靠了广泛的协作，才能顺利地建立自己的生产和研究基地，完成教学、科学研究和生产任务。我们每天有成百人到工厂企业和兄弟学校去“取经”，联系协作，参加生产或工作。另一方面，校外很多单位每天也有上百人来校要求技术支援、交流经验、参观访问和接洽协作。据今年头四个月的不完全统计，就有九千一百个单位，一万九千八百人次。这说明了高等学校正在生产建设和技术革命中发挥着越来越大的作用。
    党中央在关于教育工作的指示中指出：今后的方向，是学校办工厂和农场，工厂和农业社办学校。两年来，我校办起了具有相当水平的工厂和生产车间十五个，大大扩充和大量增建了新的实验室。学校已开始形成教学、生产和科学研究的三结合基地。两年来，我校自制的仪器设备共约三千多项，可以满足本校教学和科学研究需要的50％左右。这些自制设备有不少是花钱也买不到的。我们自己生产和装配了这些教学仪器设备，既争取了时间，又节约了外汇，也锻炼了人。
    有人虽然主张学生参加劳动，却不赞成学校建立生产基地，他们认为学生只要到校外参加劳动就可以了，这显然是“一条腿”走路的思想。事实充分证明，学校办工厂，便于生产劳动与教学建立更经常更紧密的联系，便于系统地进行探索性的科学研究和新产品的试制工作，不但有助于提高学校的教学质量和加强思想锻炼，而且还具有根本改造学校和加速我国高等学校攀登科学高峰的深远意义，对学校建立生产基地的意义认识不足，同时也就是对于党的教育方针的伟大的意义认识不足。
    二
    贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，引起了清华大学广大师生思想面貌的深刻变化。
    生产劳动的实践有力地破除了厌恶和鄙视体力劳动和劳动人民的资产阶级观点。过去有些人宣扬“体力劳动低级、脑力劳动高级”、“劳动人民大手小脑袋，知识分子小手大脑袋”。但是这些“大脑袋”在生产实践中，却笑话百出，充分暴露了他们的无能。广大师生和工人农民共同劳动，共同进行设计和科学研究，懂得了劳动人民是最有经验和最聪明的，体力劳动是最可贵的，并开始养成了体力劳动的习惯，树立了热爱劳动的风气。两年来，他们在校内、校外、工厂、农村，参加了大炼钢铁、兴修水利、抗旱、排涝、抢收抢种、造林绿化，以至卫生、理发、炊事等各种劳动中，不怕脏、不怕累，只要是生产需要，什么都干。学生到工厂是工人，到农村是农民，在劳动中很难分出工人、农民还是大学生。劳动已经改变了知识分子和劳动人民的关系。机械系同学用诗歌描写了自己对劳动的热爱：
    最好的诗啊，车刀写，最好的歌儿马达唱，
    最美的衣裳工人装，最好的味道油泥香，
    最大的幸福是劳动，最伟大的是亲爱的党。
    在劳动中，广大师生受到劳动人民冲天干劲的鼓舞，进一步加强了他们为劳动人民服务的思想和共产主义的雄心壮志，鄙弃了那种把知识当作私有财产的资产阶级个人主义思想。在技术革命中，他们看到工人在酷热的炉旁挥汗进行繁重体力劳动，懂得了工人阶级“第二次解放”的意义，有些学生成了革新迷。他们吃饭在想，把筷子当成画笔；走路在想，有时候碰上了电线杆；坐车在想，以至坐过了站；睡觉在想，半夜从梦中跳起来。他们迷的再也不是那种“一间房、两本书、副博士、小家庭”的生活，而是劳动人民的“第二次解放”。水利系同学修建水库的理想是“拦住幸福黄金水，洗净人民万代穷”。土木建筑系同学的理想则是“盖得广厦千万间，六亿人民尽欢颜”。大家都以为劳动人民服务作自己的理想，以创造性的劳动作为自己的大志。水利系同学这样用诗来描写自己的干劲：
    我把地球当铜鼓，敲得山河共起舞，
    今日敲它几百锤，明天发电亿万度。
    生产实践启发了广大群众学习和运用辩证唯物主义的自觉性。机械系学生学习毛主席著作以后，在公益劳动中，用劣质土烧成一种轻质高强度的建筑材料——陶粒，“外行”攻克了内行的尖端。现在，在全校教学、生产和科学研究工作中，学习和运用辩证唯物主义已经成为广大群众的自觉要求，形成了“人人学习毛主席，事事请教毛主席”的风气。
    由于广大群众精神面貌的深刻变化，学校生活中出现了前所未有的丰富多彩、生动活泼的景象。我们按照“有劳有逸有张有弛”的原则，和毛主席对青年所作的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，大力开展了群众性的文化、体育、民兵训练等活动。这些活动的蓬勃开展，也和学校的教育革命、技术革命、思想革命相辅相成，相互促进，并且成为培养全面发展的共产主义新人的工作中一个重要的组成部分。
    三
    反对党的教育方针的人，他们总是说，学校搞生产，就会降低教学质量，降低理论水平，使知识范围狭窄了。但事实恰恰相反。教育与生产劳动相结合，正是大大促进了理论教学和理论研究的大发展和大提高。
    为了满足生产和科学研究的需要，在基础理论的教学中，普遍增加了专业需要的内容和最新的科学技术知识，也适当地结合科学研究进行，因而学生的学习内容更加宽广，水平更为提高。例如工程数学力学系一年级同学，结合高等数学的学习，担负了某项工程的计算任务，如果按照旧的办法，单纯从数学考虑，计算方法极为复杂。但由于同学们深入了解了生产过程，大大简化了原来的“数学方程式”，很快就提出了一种新方法，算出了全部结果。他们后来发现在美国杂志上所吹嘘的一种“奥妙”解法，原来不过是同学所创造的方法的一种特例。一位数学教师惊叹地说：“想不到今天一年级同学，就干出了我们在大学毕业的时候想都不敢想的事。”
    在专业课方面，我们根据毛主席思想，总结了广大劳动人民在大跃进和技术革新和技术革命中的创造，批判地吸收了世界最新的科学技术成就，进行理论探讨和总结，开辟了新的研究方向。两年来，我们在总结科学研究所取得的成就和探讨理论的基础上，已经编写出版很多篇论文和教学参考材料。所有这些研究成果，同时也就大大丰富和提高了教学内容。
    生产实践和科学研究要求综合运用各方面的科学知识。因此，教育与生产劳动相结合就大大开扩了教师和同学的知识领域。人们解决技术问题首先必须考虑政治和经济，进行工程设计必须联系制造、施工和调正运转，解决某一学科的问题又必须联系到有关的其他学科，这样就打破了狭隘的专业界限，逐步培养学生成为一专多能的人。例如机械系师生为了制造电子计算机控制的自动机床，就需要掌握机械制造知识，也要学习电机、自动控制的知识和编制计算程序需要的高等数学知识。
    谈到高等教育，过去右派分子总是竭力宣传“今不如昔”，以清华大学为例，无论在教学质量还是在科学研究方面，应该说都是新清华远远超过旧清华。解放前，如清华大学的机械系，在解放前只设计过一种三轮车，同现在设计和制造成功的电子计算机控制的自动机床相比，就科学技术水平来论，旧清华与新清华是隔着多么长的一段距离！国民党反动统治时期的旧中国二十年，总共不过修建了一万二千瓩的水电站（不包括东北、台湾）。而去年一年我们一个学校设计的水电站装机容量就达三十六万瓩。解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，我国高等工业教育的进步非常迅速。这是党的教育方针的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东教育思想的伟大胜利！
    现在，清华大学党的领导比过去任何时候更为加强了，广大的师生职工，都决心跟着党，走社会主义道路。一支以青年为骨干的工人阶级知识分子队伍已经迅速成长起来。
    围绕着教学、生产劳动和科学研究的三结合，党的群众路线在学校工作中也有了新的发展。以毕业设计为三结合的“结合点”，许多不同专业的师生职工，组成了“多兵种”的“大兵团”，高低年级的同学组成了前后衔接的“一条龙”，集中群众力量，共同解决重大的生产和科学研究任务。这些组织形式，反映了我国高等教育战线上群众路线的生动图景。这种集体作战，互相促进，广泛地调动人们的积极性的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，也有效地培养了人们的集体主义精神。比之过去少数专家冷冷清清地单干，要优越千万倍。
    我们今后的任务，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，继续大力贯彻执行党的教育方针，不断地进行思想革命，教育革命和技术革命，为建设共产主义的清华大学奋勇前进！
