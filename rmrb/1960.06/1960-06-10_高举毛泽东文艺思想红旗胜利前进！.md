    Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art and Advance Victoriously!
    Jiang Hong, Representative of the Frontline Drama Troupe of the Nanjing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    I listened to the congratulatory speech delivered by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the report made by Comrade Lin Feng, and the introductions of the advanced deeds of many heroes on the national cultural and educational front. I have received profound education and great encouragement. The comrades of our Frontline Drama Troupe will resolutely implement these valuable instructions, conscientiously learn from these valuable experiences, and fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to us by the Party in the great cultural revolution movement.

    Advancing Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art
    The predecessor of our Frontline Drama Troupe was the battlefield service troupe of the New Fourth Army and several detachments. Like all military cultural troupes, from the day it was established, it has been advancing under the guidance of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art and the strong leadership of the Party in the army, along the direction of literature and art serving proletarian politics and literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we were active on both sides of the Yangtze River and the Huai River. We closely coordinated with the combat missions and the anti-Japanese struggle of the people in the base areas, creating and performing dramas such as "The Battle of Fanchang," which reflected our army's defense of the gateway to southern Anhui and the smashing of the Japanese bandits' large-scale mopping-up operations, "One Against Ten," which reflected the cooperation between the army and the people in fighting the enemy, and "Large-Scale Mutual Aid in Production." During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, our young literary and artistic soldiers, on the East China battlefield under the enemy's key attack, actively participated in war support work and widely carried out literary and artistic activities, creating and performing plaza song and dance dramas such as "The Great Turnaround," "Treat Him the Same," "Love the People on the Frontline," and "Milling Victory Rice." In the ten years since the national liberation, in the task of coordinating with the army in defending and participating in socialist construction, and improving the military and political qualities and cultural level of the army, we have always adhered to the creative path of focusing on creating modern themes, reflecting revolutionary struggles, and depicting heroic figures. We have successively created large-scale dramas such as "Overture to the Eastward Advance," "Fiery Red Heart," "Yang Gensi," "The Forefront on the East Sea," "Song of Youth," "A River of Red Flags," "The Veteran's March," "Water Flows to Higher Places," "Yue Xian," and "On the Road of Advance," as well as more than 700 one-act plays and various small programs. Some of them have had a relatively wide impact nationwide. For example, "Overture to the Eastward Advance" received favorable comments from all aspects when it participated in the literary and artistic performance celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. "Yang Gensi" also won a first-class performance award in the first national drama festival. "Fiery Red Heart," which we created in the early days of the Great Leap Forward, was widely performed by many troupes across the country and once caused a sensation. While completing the task of stage script creation, we also created many film scripts, such as "South and North War," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Storm on the Sea," "The Fighting Mountain Village," "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains," and so on. These films have had a good response among the masses, and "South and North War" is the first film after liberation to reflect Mao Zedong's great military thought.

    According to the path pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao, some of the heroic images with great communist style that our troupe has shaped in its creative and performance activities have inspired the fighting will of the vast number of officers and soldiers of our army and aroused the fighting enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Many old comrades, after watching "Overture to the Eastward Advance," believed that it not only summarized the struggle situation in the Su North area at that time, but also summarized the basic situation of the struggle behind enemy lines at that time. They believed that it successfully demonstrated the glorious victory of Mao Zedong's military thought and the great power of our Party's united front policy. Many units organized cadres to watch "Overture to the Eastward Advance" several times in a row, using it as a supplementary teaching material for studying Mao Zedong's military works. Many cadres and soldiers, after watching the performance of "Yang Gensi," were so excited that they shouted slogans on the spot, vowing to learn from the heroic example of the great internationalist fighter Yang Gensi and contribute all their strength to the noble cause of defending the motherland and defending peace. The image of Xu Guoqing and other demobilized soldiers in "Fiery Red Heart," who dared to think, dare to act, and start a factory from scratch, also left a deep impression on the audience. In addition, many one-act plays and various small programs created by our troupe, such as "Capture Luo Genyuan Alive," "Admitting Defeat," "Double Happiness," "Don't Spit Everywhere," "Dongshan Foreign Film," and "Don't Correct," were also warmly welcomed by the vast number of commanders and fighters of the army. The creation and performance of "Don't Correct" is an example. During our tour performances in the army, we encountered the following incident: a blaster created a record of six hundred shots "blooming in every shot." When the news was published in the newspaper, six hundred shots were mistakenly reported as eight hundred shots. The comrades in the army wanted to write a letter to the newspaper to request a correction. This blaster made a great ambition, worked hard, and soon achieved eight hundred shots "blooming in every shot." We immediately created a short play reflecting this revolutionary heroism: "Don't Correct." These small programs also played a role in promoting the leap forward in various aspects of the army.

    Bringing Performances to Islands and Companies
    Under the guidance of the principle of wholeheartedly serving the army, our Frontline Drama Troupe not only reflected the spiritual outlook and heroic achievements of the people's army in many aspects of creation, but also regarded it as its glory to be able to serve the companies and the soldiers in its performance activities. Our slogan is: face the company, be in the company, have your heart in the company, run all over the company, perform for the company, and teach the company. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line and on the basis of the ideological harvest of the rectification movement, we have been full of vigor and high spirits, using a variety of performance forms combining large, medium, and small, going to islands and companies, bringing performances to the doorstep, and trying our best to let the soldiers see more of our programs. In this year of 1958 alone, we performed 1,288 shows, averaging three and a half shows per day.

    Because the army is performing heavy tasks such as combat readiness, training, and construction, especially the coastal defense and air defense troops are highly dispersed, the soldiers have fewer opportunities to watch plays. Therefore, as long as we go down to the army, the vast number of officers and soldiers strongly demand that we perform more for them. During the rectification movement in 1958, our entire troupe had a heated discussion and debate on how to give more performances for the companies and soldiers. Everyone proposed to fully develop the fine tradition and style of the previous battlefield performances and adopt the method of bringing performances to the door. Therefore, we formed the actors into several "light cavalry teams" that brought their own scenery and props and could perform medium and small-sized performances, going to islands, mountains, and companies, to construction sites, playgrounds, classrooms, dormitories, dining halls, and哨所, to all places where soldiers were active, and widely展开演出活动。In order to enable more soldiers to see the performances, our "light cavalry team" also imitated the method of movie "running slices," with one light cavalry team continuously performing in several units in half a day in rotation. This enabled the soldiers to see the performances without leaving their combat posts or their驻地。We once performed a program of more than one and a half hours for a construction unit of twelve people and for the dining hall with only three cooks. This kind of "light cavalry team" that brings performances to the door works very hard, performing seven or eight hours, or even more than ten hours, every day. Often they don't have time to eat, and they can only carry one or two馒头 with them, and when they are hungry, they gnaw on them. But every one of our comrades feels the greatest pleasure in being able to serve these border defense island troops.

    For the scattered troops on land, sea, and air, we not only perform small and medium-sized programs on the doorstep, but also think of various ways to enable them to see many large-scale dramas, such as "Yang Gensi," "Fiery Red Heart," "Overture to the Eastward Advance," and so on. We have made many reforms to the performance methods of these large-scale dramas according to different situations. In places where conditions are very difficult, such as the frontline observation posts on the islands, where there is no stage, we set up a folding activity screen of our own creation in the soldiers' dormitory and put up one or two tables to perform. If there are many outdoor scenes, such as "Yang Gensi," we choose terrain conditions that are relatively similar to the plot (such as choosing a high slope as the 1200 highland in the play) to perform.

    Helping Troops Carry Out Literary and Artistic Activities
    While actively carrying out creative and performance activities, we also inherited and developed the tradition of carrying out troop literary and artistic activities on the front line in the past war years, going wherever we went and helping the troops to carry out mass literary and artistic activities. We adopted various methods to help the troops teach songs, rehearse plays, help the companies carry out club activities, and help amateur writers engage in literary and artistic creation. We also created the activity form of "cultural fair," more widely organizing the masses to participate in literary and artistic activities. This form is to use holidays to choose a location where troops are relatively concentrated, insert彩旗, arrange various game "摊子," such as guessing lantern riddles, 套四害,摆棋局, teach singing, and set up book and newspaper, magazine摊……, like going to a temple fair, where officers and soldiers come here, talking and singing, watching and playing, which is both meaningful entertainment and cultivates their interest in literary and art.

    In order to make literary and artistic activities better and more active, we also paid attention to strengthening the training of literary and artistic backbones in the companies. Every time we went to a unit, we helped the troops train backbones in groups or battalions. Especially for the troops' amateur performance teams, we regarded them as the focus of training and paid attention to establishing regular contact with them. Through these activities, we have made certain contributions to promoting the development of mass and regular literary and artistic activities in the troops and to prospering the literary and artistic work of the troops.

    Implementing the Mass Line Under the Leadership of the Party
    These achievements of ours have been achieved under the strong leadership of the Party and the kind care of the leaders of the troops, and are the result of relying on the masses and implementing the mass line.

    The Party teaches us at all times to adhere to the implementation of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art and to develop revolutionary literary and artistic work in the correct direction. The Party committees and leaders of the troops not only grasp our political and ideological leadership, but also give us strong guidance in creation and performance. The leaders of the Nanjing Military Region arrange our creative and performance work every year, put forward directions, assign tasks, and provide thematic clues. Many leaders also personally help us study outlines and carry out creation.

    In the process of creating the film script "South and North War," Marshal Chen Yi took the time to personally review the first draft of the script, and then organized the authors to discuss, using many vivid examples to explain that the victory of the East China battlefield was the victory of Mao Zedong's military thought, and clearly pointed out that the work "South and North War" should highlight this theme. These instructions of Marshal Chen Yi played a decisive role in improving the ideological and artistic nature of the script.

    The clue for the drama "Fiery Red Heart" was provided to our troupe by General Zhou Huan while he was recuperating from illness. He asked our troupe to send an author to Changxing County with him to collect materials. Comrade Zhou Huan personally participated in the research of the entire work from the beginning of the structure to the final draft, and even helped to revise it word by word.

    The creation of the drama "Overture to the Eastward Advance" is even more so. This is a work reflecting the historical theme of our army. When the author collected materials, he received many valuable instructions from many old comrades who personally participated in this historical event at that time. Before the first rehearsal of the play, Xu Shiyou, Commander of the Nanjing Military Region, and Tang Liang, Political Commissar, invited many leaders of the troops to review it, and carefully studied how the character Chen Bingguang correctly grasped the policy of our Party's anti-Japanese national united front in the "Tongue Battle Against the Stubborn" scene, and how to have both a high degree of principle and full flexibility, greatly enriching the artistic image of Chen Bingguang. Before this play participated in the Second All-Army Literary and Art Performance, the leaders of the Nanjing Military Region watched the performance five or six times before and after, and each time put forward specific suggestions for revision. After the Second All-Army Literary and Art Performance, many responsible comrades of the Central Committee and leaders of the General Political Department gave many valuable instructions, so that the work "Overture to the Eastward Advance" gradually reached a relatively perfect degree in terms of ideological and artistic nature.

    The Party teaches us that literary and artistic undertakings, like other undertakings of the Party, must implement the mass line and give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Artistic creation (including playwrighting, directing, acting, and stage art design) is not an individual undertaking, but a collective undertaking. Our troupe has always taken this as a guiding ideology for its professional construction.

    The artistic creation of our troupe in playwrighting, directing, acting, and stage art design has almost all gone through such a process: the initial independent conception of each person, then the collective discussion within the scope of business, and then the collective research of the entire rehearsal or performance unit. We usually call this method "the combination of playwrighting, directing, acting, and stage art design." The use of this method has given full play to the wisdom of all comrades, and the artistic quality and performance level of the performance programs have been greatly improved. At the same time, this method has improved the artistic accomplishment and creative ability of each comrade, not only making full-time cadres continuously improve, but also enabling other comrades to gradually learn playwrighting and directing work, creating favorable conditions for widely carrying out mass playwrighting and directing activities.

    To meet the needs of such a large number of performances as mentioned above, it is obviously not enough to rely on a few full-time playwrights and directors. We launched a mass movement for creation and rehearsal, with everyone participating, each showing their abilities, and comprehensively carrying out key training. The comrades have a high enthusiasm for participating in playwrighting and directing activities. In the backstage, in the field, in the dormitory, in the car…… they write whenever they have time, and rehearse whenever they have time. Because we broke the superstition, many comrades who had never written articles before, including technicians engaged in stage work, also started to create many programs, many of which were of relatively high quality and had good publicity effects, making the dramas we performed constantly rich and constantly new. Now many comrades can not only create and rehearse small dramas, but also participate in the playwrighting and directing of large-scale dramas. In this way, by mobilizing the masses and using collective strength, we have trained a group of "all-rounders" who can write, direct, and perform, and have appeared some talents who are close to the level of full-time playwrights and directors, expanding the playwrighting and directing team.

    Go Deep Into the Fiery Struggle
    The Party teaches us that to do a good job in literary and artistic work, we must go deep into the fiery struggle and closely contact the masses. Since 1953, under the call of the leaders of the troops, our entire troupe began a relatively long period of going down to the companies to experience life. Full-time creators spend a long time in the masses every year to live and create, make friends with the soldiers, and establish "creative bases." Since 1958, we have more consistently implemented the system of going down to the companies to be soldiers and going to the countryside to work, eating, living, working, and operating with the soldiers and members. Not only during the 放锻炼, but also during the usual performances in the troops, we do everything possible to use the gaps between performances to go to the construction sites and companies to work and live with the soldiers. The female comrades also cook and deliver water, wash clothes, and mend shoes and socks for the soldiers. The actors and soldiers are as close as brothers and sisters. Through these activities, we have maintained close contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, bringing us rich harvests. Their soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, selfless working attitude, pure class feelings, and lofty communist style have given the团员们 profound education. We learned how to shoot guns and cannons, construction techniques, and production skills from them, accumulated life knowledge, collected various素材, and learned the vocabulary of the masses. This has enriched the source of creation and created conditions for improving performance skills. We have established a deep friendship with the soldiers and have been loved by the vast number of commanders and fighters of the troops. Whenever we go to the troops to perform, the troops often line up in long lines, beating鑼鼓, to welcome us; when we leave, both sides often say goodbye with tears in their eyes. In the year 1958 alone, we received thousands of letters of praise from the troops. These letters mainly praised us for maintaining and developing the fine tradition and style of the cultural troupe during the war. One company also sent us a couplet, the first line is "Morning, noon, evening, always see"; the second line is "Classroom, playground, dining hall, perform everywhere"; the横批 is "Soaring enthusiasm."

    These achievements of our Frontline Drama Troupe are the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art and the Party's literary and artistic policies! We must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's Thought on Literature and Art, advance victoriously, and strive to create and perform more and better plays to answer the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao to us.

    高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗胜利前进！
    中国人民解放军南京部队前线话剧团代表　江泓
    我听了陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院所致的祝词和林枫同志所作的报告，听了各位首长的讲话和全国文教战线上许多英雄们的先进事迹介绍，受到了深刻的教育和巨大的鼓舞。我们前线话剧团的同志，一定坚决贯彻这些宝贵的指示，认真学习这些宝贵的经验，在伟大的文化革命运动中，完成党所交给我们的光荣使命。
    在毛主席文艺思想指导下前进
    我们前线话剧团的前身，是新四军军队和几个支队的战地服务团。它和部队所有文工团一样，从成立的那天起，就在毛主席文艺思想指导下和部队党的坚强领导下，沿着文艺为无产阶级政治服务、文艺为工农兵服务的方向前进。在八年抗日战争中，我们活跃在大江南北和淮河两岸。我们紧密地配合着战斗任务和根据地人民的抗日斗争，创作和演出了反映我军保卫皖南门户、粉碎日本强盗大扫荡的“繁昌之战”，反映军民合作打击敌人的“一个打十个”，以及“生产大互助”等剧目。在第三次国内革命战争中，我们年轻的文艺战士，在敌人重点进攻的华东战场上，随着部队行军作战，积极参加了战勤工作，广泛开展文艺活动，创作和演出了广场歌舞剧“大翻身”、“一样爱护他”、“火线爱民”、“碾胜利米”等剧目。全国解放以后的十年，我们在配合部队保卫与参加社会主义建设，提高部队军政素质和文化水平的任务中，始终坚持着以创作现代题材、反映革命斗争、描写英雄人物为主的创作道路，先后创作了大型话剧“东进序曲”、“烈火红心”、“杨根思”、“东海最前线”、“青春之歌”、“一江红旗”、“老将行”、“水往高处流”、“岳仙”、“在前进的道路上”等，以及独幕话剧和多种多样的小型节目共七百余个。其中有一些在全国具有比较广泛的影响，比如“东进序曲”在参加建国十周年文艺献礼演出的时候，曾经获得各方面的好评。“杨根思”在全国第一届话剧会演中，也获得了演出一等奖。我们在大跃进初期创作的“烈火红心”，全国很多剧团普遍上演，曾经轰动一时。在完成舞台剧本创作任务的同时，我们还创作了不少电影文学剧本，比如“南征北战”、“渡江侦察记”、“海上风暴”、“战斗的山村”、“江山多娇”等等。这些影片，在群众中有着良好的反映，其中“南征北战”又是解放后第一部以反映毛主席伟大军事思想为题材的影片。
    按照党和毛主席所指引的道路，我团在创作和演出活动中所塑造的一些具有伟大的共产主义风格的英雄形象，鼓舞了我军广大官兵的战斗意志，激发了广大人民群众的斗争热情。许多老同志看了“东进序曲”，认为它不仅概括了当时苏北地区的斗争情况，也概括了当时敌后斗争的基本面貌，认为它成功地表现了毛主席军事思想的光辉胜利和我们党的统一战线政策的巨大威力。许多单位接连几次组织干部看“东进序曲”，把它作为学习毛主席军事著作的辅助教材。许多干部战士看了“杨根思”的演出，激动得当场高呼口号，要学习伟大的国际主义战士杨根思的英雄榜样，为保卫祖国保卫和平的崇高事业贡献全部力量。“烈火红心”中的敢想敢干、白手起家办工厂的许国清等复员军人的形象，也给观众留下了深刻的印象。此外，我团创作的许多独幕话剧和各种各样的小型节目，像“活捉罗根源”、“服输记”、“双喜临门”、“不要随地吐痰”、“东山洋片”、“不要更正”等，也都受到了部队广大指战员的热烈欢迎。“不要更正”的创作与演出，就是一个例子。我们在部队巡回演出中，遇到这样一件事：有一个爆破手，创造了六百炮“炮炮开花”的纪录。报纸发表消息的时候，把六百炮误为八百炮。部队同志要写信给报社要求更正。这个爆破手同志立下了雄心大志，刻苦钻研，很快就达到了八百炮“炮炮开花”。我们马上编出了反映这种革命英雄主义精神的小剧：“不要更正”。这些小型节目，也对部队各方面的跃进，起到了促进作用。
    上岛下连送戏上门
    我们前线话剧团，在全心全意为部队服务的方针指导下，不仅在创作上从多方面反映了人民军队的精神面貌和英雄业绩，并且在演出活动中，把能够为连队、为士兵服务，当作是自己的光荣。我们的口号是：面向连队，身在连队，心在连队，跑遍连队，演给连队，教给连队。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在整风运动思想丰收的基础上，更是干劲冲天，意气风发，运用了多种多样的大、中、小相结合的演出形式，上岛下连，送戏上门，尽量让士兵多看我们的节目。就在这1958年一年中，我们演出了一千二百八十八场，平均每天演出三场半。
    由于部队执行着繁重的战备、训练、施工等各项任务，特别是海边防和空防部队高度分散，战士们看戏的机会比较少。所以，只要我们一下部队，广大官兵都强烈地要求我们为他们多演。在1958年整风运动中，我们全团对于如何为连队、为士兵作更多的演出，曾经展开了热烈的讨论和辩论。大家提出了要充分发扬以往战地演出的优良传统作风，采取送戏上门的办法。于是我们把演员组成了若干个自带布景、道具，能够作中小型演出的“轻骑队”，上岛、上山、下连，到工地、操场、课堂、宿舍、饭厅、哨所，到一切有战士活动的场所，广泛展开演出活动。为了使更多的战士能看到演出，我们的“轻骑队”还效仿电影“跑片子”的办法，一个轻骑队在半天内连续到几个单位轮回演出。这就使战士们不离开战斗岗位，不离开驻地，就能看到演出。我们曾经为施工部队十二个人的作业班，为只有三个炊事员的伙房，单独演出了一个半小时以上的节目。这种送戏上门的轻骑队，工作十分紧张，每天都要演出七八小时，甚至十几小时，时常饭也来不及吃，只能随身带一两个馒头，饿了就啃一口，但是我们每一个同志都以能够为这些边防海岛部队的战士服务，感到最大的愉快。
    我们对陆海空的分散部队，不仅仅上门演出中小型节目，并且还想了种种方法，使他们也能看到许多大型的话剧，例如“杨根思”、“烈火红心”、“东进序曲”等等。我们对这些大型的剧目的演出方法，根据不同情况作了许多改革。在条件十分困难的地方，比如海岛前沿观察所，没有舞台，我们就在战士的宿舍，用自己创造的折叠活动屏风一挡，摆上一两张桌子就演起来了。如果外景戏多，像“杨根思”，我们就选择与剧情比较近似的地形条件（比如选一个高坡，作为戏里的一二○○高地），进行演出。
    帮助部队开展文艺活动
    我们在积极开展创作和演出活动的同时，还继承和发扬了过去战争年代在火线上开展部队文艺活动的传统，走到哪里就在哪里帮助部队开展群众性的文艺活动。我们采用了多种方法，帮助部队教歌、排戏，帮助连队开展俱乐部活动，帮助业余作者搞文艺创作。我们还创造了“文化赶集”的活动形式，更广泛地组织群众参加文艺活动。这种形式就是，利用假日，选择部队驻地比较集中的地点，插上彩旗，布置各种游戏“摊子”，比如猜灯谜，套四害，摆棋局，教唱歌，以及设立书报、杂志摊……，好像赶庙会那样，官兵们来到这里，有说有唱，又看又玩，既是有意义的娱乐，又培养了他们喜爱文艺的兴趣。
    为了使文艺活动能够更好地、更大地活跃起来，我们还注意了加强对连队文艺骨干的培养。每到一个单位，都以团或营为单位，帮助部队训练骨干。特别是对部队的业余演出队，我们更是作为培养的重点，并且注意和他们建立经常的联系。通过这些活动，我们为促进部队群众性的、经常性的文艺活动的开展，为繁荣部队的文艺工作，作出了一定的贡献。
    在党的领导下贯彻群众路线
    我们这些成绩，是在党的坚强领导下和部队首长的亲切关怀下取得的，是依靠群众，贯彻群众路线的结果。
    党时时刻刻教导我们，要坚持贯彻毛泽东文艺思想，沿着正确的方向发展革命的文艺工作。部队党委和首长不但抓紧对我们的政治思想领导，而且在创作和演出上也给了我们有力的指导。南京部队领导上每年都要对我们的创作和演出工作进行安排，提出方向，交代任务，提供题材线索。许多首长还亲自帮助我们研究提纲，进行创作。
    在电影剧本“南征北战”的创作过程中，陈毅元帅曾经抽出时间，亲自审阅了剧本的初稿，以后又组织作者座谈，用许多生动的事例，阐明华东战场的胜利就是毛主席军事思想的胜利，明确指出“南征北战”这一作品，要突出这个主题思想。陈毅元帅的这些指示，对提高剧本的思想性、艺术性都起了决定的作用。
    话剧“烈火红心”，是周桓上将在养病中向我团提供的线索。他要我团派作者随他一起到长兴县去搜集材料。整个作品从开始结构到最后定稿，周桓同志都亲自参加研究，甚至逐字逐句地帮助修改。
    话剧“东进序曲”的创作更是如此。这是一个反映我军历史题材的作品。作者搜集素材的时候，得到了许多当时亲身参加这一历史事件的老同志的很多宝贵指示。这个戏第一次彩排演出，南京部队司令员许士友上将，政治委员唐亮上将就请了许多部队首长来进行审查，并且细致地研究了剧中人陈秉光在“舌战群顽”这一场戏中，如何正确地掌握我党的抗日民族统一战线的政策，如何既要有高度的原则性又有充分的灵活性，大大地丰富了陈秉光这一人物的艺术形象。这个戏参加全军第二届文艺会演之前，南京部队首长前后看了五、六次演出，每次都提出具体修改意见。在全军第二届文艺会演之后，中央许多负责同志和总政治部首长，又作了许多宝贵指示，使“东进序曲”这个作品在思想性和艺术性上逐步达到比较完美的程度。
    党教导我们，文学艺术事业如同党的其它事业一样，必须贯彻群众路线，发挥广大群众的积极性。艺术创造（包括编剧、导演、演员、舞台美术设计在内）不是个人的事业，而是集体的事业。我团的业务建设，始终拿这个作为指导思想。
    我团编剧、导演、演员和舞台美术设计几个方面的艺术创造，差不多都经历了这样一个过程：最初是各人的独立构思，而后是业务范围内的集体讨论，再后是整个排演或演出单位的集体研究。这种方法，我们通常称之为“编、导、演和舞台美术设计四结合”。运用这种方法，充分发挥了全体同志的智慧，使演出节目的艺术质量和上演水平有了很大的提高。同时，通过这种方法，提高了每个同志的艺术修养和创造能力，不仅使专职干部不断提高，并且使其他同志逐步学会了编导工作，为广泛开展群众性的编导活动，创造了有利的条件。
    要满足前面所讲的这样大量的演出的需要，光靠少数专职的编导人员显然是不行的，我们就大搞创作、排演的群众运动，人人动手，各显其能，全面开展，重点培养。同志们参加编导活动的热情很高，在后台，在野外，在宿舍，在车上……有空就写，有空就排。由于破除了迷信，许多从来没有写过文章的同志，包括搞舞台工作的技工同志，也都动起手来创作了很多节目，其中有不少质量比较高、宣传效果比较好的优秀作品，使我们上演的剧目不断丰富，不断翻新。现在不少同志不仅能够创作、排演小型剧目，也能参加大型剧目的编导了。就这样，通过发动群众，运用集体力量，我们培养了一批能编、能导、能演的“一专多能”的多面手，出现了一些接近专职编导水平的人材，扩大了编导队伍。
    深入火热的斗争
    党教导我们，要搞好文艺工作，必须深入火热的斗争，密切联系群众。1953年以来，我们全团在部队首长的号召下，就开始了比较长期的下连体验生活。专职创作人员，每年都有较长的时间在群众中生活、创作，和战士们交朋友，建立“创作据点”。1958年以来，我们更坚持贯彻了下连当兵和到农村劳动的制度，和战士、社员同吃同住同劳动同操作。不仅在下放锻炼中，就是平时下部队演出，也尽一切可能利用演出空隙，到工地和连队，同战士们一起劳动，一起生活，女同志还为战士们烧饭送水，洗衣服，补鞋袜，演员和战士亲如兄弟姐妹。通过这些活动，保持了和工农兵的亲密相处，带给了我们丰富的收获。他们冲天的革命干劲，忘我的劳动态度，纯朴的阶级感情，崇高的共产主义风格，给了团员们深刻的教育。我们从他们那里学会了打枪放炮、施工技术和生产技能，积累了生活知识，搜集了各种素材，学习了群众的语汇。这就丰富了创作源泉，也为提高表演技巧创造了条件。我们和战士们建立了深厚的友谊，受到了部队广大指战员的热爱，每当我们去部队演出时，部队往往排着很长的队伍，打着锣鼓，来欢迎我们；离开时，常常双方都流着眼泪告别。在1958年一年中，我们就收到部队上千封的表扬信件。这些来信主要是表扬我们保持和发扬了过去在战争期间文工团的优良传统作风。有一个连队还给我们送来了一副对联，上联是“早晨、中午、晚上、时时见”；下联是“课堂、操场、饭厅、处处演”；横批是“干劲冲天”。
    我们前线话剧团所取得的这些成就，是毛主席的文艺思想和党的文艺方针的光辉胜利！我们一定戒骄戒躁，继续努力，更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，乘胜前进，争取创作和演出更多更好的戏，来回答党和毛主席对我们的教导。
