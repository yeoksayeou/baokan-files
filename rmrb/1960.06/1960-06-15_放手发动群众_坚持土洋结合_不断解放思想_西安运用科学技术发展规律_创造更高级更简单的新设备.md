Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 14th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Yi Xiao and Li Qian report: Creating and utilizing more advanced yet simpler new technologies and processes is the current new development in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Xi'an. This development is the result of Xi'an's workers mastering and applying the dialectical law of production technology development, from simple to complex, and then from complex to more advanced simplicity.

In the process of "four modernizations" in Xi'an's enterprises, production efficiency has increased, but at the same time, technical equipment has also increased accordingly. In this process of technological development, workers have discovered that some processes can be merged, and thus they have made various improvements to technical equipment to simplify it. For example, some factories used to add a reducer to slow down the rotation speed of ball mills, but later the workers put the belt on the outer shell of the ball mill, which achieved the same effect and saved the reducer. At the same time, the emergence and application of both indigenous and foreign new technologies have also simplified the increasingly complex technical equipment and processes. This situation has inspired many workers. Under the guidance of continuously revolutionary thinking, they are now further carrying out concentrated and systematic innovation of the entire production process and technical equipment to reduce processes, reform and shorten production flows, or adopt new technologies and find new process methods, thereby developing towards simplifying technical equipment on the premise of high efficiency, in order to achieve more economical and rational production.

The development of technical equipment and processes from simple to complex, and then from complex to advanced simple, in Xi'an roughly falls into the following three categories:

The first is that the original simple manual operations have become semi-mechanized or mechanized in the innovation movement, and the technical equipment has become complex; now they are merging processes and improving equipment to achieve advanced simplicity. For example, in the past, the blanking workshop of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory had to go through three manual operation procedures to press sheet metal into shape. When technical innovation began, the blanking workers replaced all three manual operations with machines, and then used a conveyor belt to connect the three processes into a联动line. Recently, when considering technical innovation in blanking, they studied merging the three processes to be carried out together, creating a special cup pressing die, which completed the above three processes in one pressing on a press, improving efficiency and saving two presses and conveying and power equipment.

The second is that the original mechanicalization has been simplified through the merging of processes and the improvement of technical equipment in the innovation movement. For example, the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory has saved a large number of valuable synthesis equipment such as reaction pots used in the past due to the adoption of new synthesis methods; at the same time, it has increased the recovery rate of finished products, increasing the daily output of aspirin from 270 kilograms to 1,500 kilograms, and also ensuring the safety of production. In technical innovation, the Xi'an Textile Factory is using new technologies to change the work of the previous four sections of pre-spinning to be completed by one process.

The third is to skip the complex process and reach the sky in one step, developing from low-level simple to advanced simple at once. For example, the Communist Youth League Chemical Factory, which originally used simple equipment such as basins and jars for manual production, has recently absorbed advanced synthesis technology without adding many complex mechanical equipment, and has directly achieved advanced simple from low-level simple. In the past, the Northwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute absorbed foreign experience and used a large number of complex equipment in the design of a new mechanized ceramic factory. Recently, this institute collected and summarized the advanced experience created by Chinese workers in technical innovation and applied the latest technology to the design, which greatly simplified the original design. For example, in the past, the slurry in the forming workshop of the ceramic factory was transported manually, and according to foreign experience, it was pumped with a slurry pump. This institute, together with the Beijing Ceramic Factory, studied and used the pressure of the degassing tank used for slurry degassing to transport the slurry, and one set of equipment completed two tasks, thus saving a lot of equipment. They also used the most advanced technology to change multiple crushing to one crushing, reducing processes and saving a large number of ball mills, power, handling and other complete sets of equipment, as well as a large amount of labor and operating area.

This new development in Xi'an's technical innovation movement is the result of boldly mobilizing the masses, adhering to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and continuously emancipating the mind. Previously, some people thought that in order to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, it was necessary to continuously increase technical equipment, and it seemed that the more advanced it was, the more complex it would be, and the more equipment would be needed. Under the control of this view, some people asked for more and more complex technical equipment when they talked about innovation; while others believed that factories with good technical equipment and a high degree of mechanization and automation had "nothing to innovate." This hindered the forward development of the movement. The party organizations of various factories adhered to the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and many factories created and applied new technologies and processes. After the realization of many major and advanced innovation projects, instead of making the technology more complex and the equipment more numerous, the equipment operation became simpler. This greatly improved people's understanding. In the beginning, in order to solve the problem of mechanized enamel coating, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory considered that very complex equipment was needed after consideration by several experts, and it was once planned to use electrostatic enamel spraying, which required a set of 140,000-volt high-voltage power equipment, which was simply beyond the factory's capacity. Later, the factory's party committee held a technical meeting mainly composed of production workers, and everyone boldly envisioned and researched, and used only very simple equipment to make an enamel coating machine that was both economical and efficient. This prompted the continuous emancipation of the minds of the workers.

The relevant leading departments in Xi'an believe that this evolution from simple to complex and then to more advanced simple in technical equipment reflects the law of scientific and technological development. Creating and applying new technologies and processes, making the increasingly complex technical equipment and production processes in the process of gradually realizing the "four modernizations" tend to be simplified, can not only save a large amount of materialized labor and living labor, greatly improve labor productivity, but also create a shortcut for carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution quickly, well, and economically, and developing science and technology. Especially in the case of uneven development of technical innovation in various factories, clarifying this idea can enable some factories with manual operations or poor mechanization to absorb the experience of those who have already turned complex technical equipment into simple ones, skip the complex process, and take a step towards advanced simplicity.

Now, the movement to create and apply new technologies and new processes to simplify technical equipment and technological processes in Xi'an is developing further, extensively and deeply. For example, in addition to simplifying equipment and merging technological processes in production methods, many factories in the machinery industry are also conducting product design innovation to provide the entire national economic sector with more scientific, rational, and economical technical equipment, changing equipment from heavy to light, from large to small, from complex to simple, and from low efficiency to high efficiency. Many machinery factories are now attacking new processes such as precision casting and cold pressing. The application of precision casting and pressing technology no longer requires cutting and processing, which can greatly reduce the most complex, most numerous, and most expensive metal cutting equipment in machinery factories.

    放手发动群众　坚持土洋结合　不断解放思想
    西安运用科学技术发展规律  创造更高级更简单的新设备
    据新华社西安14日电　新华社记者伊晓、李茜报道：创造和运用更高级而又更简单的新技术、新工艺，是西安市技术革新和技术革命运动目前的新发展。这一发展是西安市职工掌握和运用了生产技术发展由简单到复杂，又由复杂到更高级的简单这一辩证规律的结果。
    西安市各企业在“四化”过程中，生产效率提高了，但同时技术装备也在相应地增加着。在这个技术发展过程中，职工们发现有些工序还可以合并，因而又对技术设备进行了种种改进，使之简化。如有的工厂过去为了减慢球磨机的转速而加上减速器，后来工人把皮带搭在球磨机外壳上，既达到了同样效果，还节省下了减速器。与此同时，土的和洋的新技术的出现和运用，也使原来日益复杂的技术设备和工艺趋向简单。这种情况启发了许多职工，目前他们在不断革命思想的指导下，更进一步对整个生产过程及技术装备进行集中系统的革新，以减少工序、改革和缩短生产流程，或采用新技术和寻找新的工艺方法，从而在高效率的前提下，向着简化技术装备发展，以达到生产的更经济更合理。
    技术设备和工艺由简单到复杂，再由复杂到高级的简单的发展，在西安市大体有下列三种情况：
    第一种是原来简单的手工操作在革新运动中变成半机械化、机械化后，技术设备复杂了；现在又来合并工序和改进设备，使之达到高级的简单。如西安人民搪瓷厂制坯车间过去把铁皮压制成型，要经过三道手工操作工序。技术革新开始，制坯工人把制坯的三道手工操作都以机械代替了，接着又以传送带把三道工序连接成一条联动线。最近他们在考虑制坯技术革新时，研究把三道工序合并到一起来进行，创造了一个特制口杯压模，在一部压车上一次压制，就完成了以上三道工序的任务，效率提高了，还节省出两部压车和传送、动力设备。
    第二种是原来就是机械化的，在革新运动中经过合并工序和改进技术设备，使生产趋向简化。如西安制药厂由于采用了新的合成方法，节省了过去使用的反应锅等大量贵重的合成设备；同时提高了成品回收率，使阿斯匹林的日产量由二百七十公斤提高到一千五百公斤，还保证了生产的安全。西安纺织厂在技术革新中采用新技术，正在把以前前纺的四个工段的工作，改由一道工序来完成。
    第三种是不经过复杂化的过程，便一步登天，由低级的简单一下发展到高级的简单。如原来用盆盆罐罐等简单设备进行手工生产的共青团化工厂，最近吸收了先进合成技术，不必增加许多复杂的机械设备，一下子就由低级的简单达到高级的简单。西北工业建筑设计院过去吸收外国经验，在设计新的机械化陶瓷厂中要用大量复杂的设备，最近，这个院搜集总结我国工人在技术革新中创造的先进经验和把最新技术运用到设计中，就较原来设计大大简化。如过去陶瓷厂成型车间输送泥浆都是人工操作，按照外国经验都是用泥浆泵抽送。这个院和北京陶瓷厂研究、利用泥浆脱气所用的脱气罐的压力输送泥浆，一套设备完成两项任务，因此节省了大量设备。他们还使用最先进的技术把多次粉碎改为一次粉碎，减少了工序，节省大量的球磨机、动力、搬运等全套设备，以及大量的劳动力和作业面积。
    西安市技术革新运动的这一新发展，是放手发动群众，坚持土洋结合，不断解放思想的结果。以前，有些人以为要进行技术革新和技术革命，就一定要不断增加技术设备，而且似乎是越高级就越复杂，设备也就要愈多。在这种观点支配下，有的人一谈到革新就要求增加更多更复杂的技术装备；而有的人对技术装备好，机械化、自动化程度高的工厂，则认为“无啥可革”。这就阻碍了运动向前发展。各工厂党组织坚持了放手发动群众和土洋办法并举的方针，许多工厂创造和运用了新技术和新工艺。许多重大的、高级的革新项目实现后，不是使技术更加复杂和设备更多，而是使设备操作更加简单。这就大大提高了人们的认识。西安人民搪瓷厂开始为了解决涂琅机械化的问题，经过若干专家考虑，都以为需要很复杂的设备，并曾经计划采用静电喷琅，为此需要十四万伏的一套高压电力设备，根本不是这个厂力所能及的。后来这个厂党委召开了以生产工人为主的技术会议，大家大胆设想和研究，只用很简单的设备就制成了既经济、工效又高的涂琅机。这就促使职工的思想不断得到解放。
    西安市有关领导部门认为，这种在技术装备上的由简单到复杂，再到更高级的简单，反映了科学技术发展的规律。创造和运用新技术、新工艺，使原来在逐渐实现“四化”过程中日益复杂的技术设备和生产过程，趋向简单化，不但能节约下大量的物化劳动和活劳动，大大提高劳动生产率，而且还为多快好省地进行技术革新、技术革命，发展科学技术，开辟了一条捷径。特别是在各厂技术革新发展参差不齐的情况下，明确这一思想，就可以使一些手工操作或机械化程度较差的工厂，能够吸收那些已经把复杂的技术装备变为简单的经验，越过复杂的过程，一步登天走上高级的简单。
    现在，西安市创造和运用新技术、新工艺简化技术装备和工艺过程的运动，正在进一步广泛深入的发展。如机械工业中的许多工厂除在生产方法上简化设备合并工艺过程等等以外，为了给整个国民经济部门提供更科学、更合理、更经济的技术装备，在进行产品设计革新中，把设备由重改轻，由大改小，由复杂改为简单，由效率低改为效率高。许多机械工厂现在都在猛攻精密铸造、冷压等新工艺。应用精密铸压技术不再需要切削加工，就可以大大减少机械厂中最复杂、最多、最贵的金属切削设备。
