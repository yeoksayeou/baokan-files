    Congratulations on the Independence of the Mali Federation

    Today, in Africa, where the dawn of freedom has begun to rise, a new country, the Mali Federation, has declared its independence. The Chinese people, along with freedom and independence-loving people all over the world, are delighted with this good news and extend heartfelt congratulations to the people of the Mali Federation. Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, in his congratulatory telegram to the Mali Federation, on behalf of the government and people of our country, wished the people of the Mali Federation new achievements in the cause of safeguarding national independence.

    The people of the Mali Federation are a heroic people. They have waged a long and arduous struggle for national independence. From the mid-nineteenth century, French colonialists invaded Senegal and Sudan in West Africa, now the Mali Federation, and then established colonial rule there. From the first day of the French colonialists' invasion, the people of this region waged a heroic resistance against the French colonial army. For almost the entire second half of the nineteenth century, this armed resistance movement never ceased. After the outbreak of World War II, with the growth of the working class in Senegal and Sudan, the workers' movement was combined with the national independence movement, becoming a powerful force impacting French colonial rule. The conference of trade union representatives from French West Africa held in Bamako, Sudan, in 1951, clearly put forward a program of struggle to liberate themselves from the colonial system. In 1958, the Senegalese trade unions, at the call of the General Confederation of Black African Workers, called for a vote against the de Gaulle constitution in the referendum, demanding independence. Trade unions, political parties, and other organizations also held National Independence Week, and during de Gaulle's visit to Dakar, they held demonstrations demanding that de Gaulle go back and demanding national independence. The independence of the Mali Federation today is the result of the long-term struggle of the people of Senegal and Sudan.

    Colonialists often claim that the colonial people can only survive and live "a good life" by relying on them. This fallacy is not worth refuting. In fact, it is precisely because of the French colonialists' brutal plunder and exploitation that the people of the Mali Federation have lived in extreme hardship for a long time. We believe that after the Mali Federation declares its independence, as long as the people of the entire federation continue to hold high the banner of independence and continue to struggle to completely eliminate colonialist forces and develop the cause of national independence, they will be able to build a better life on their own land through their hard work.

    The current independence of the Mali Federation has also been achieved under the impetus of the rising tide of the African national independence movement. The birth of new countries in Africa one after another, especially the emergence of the Republic of Guinea, cannot but have a significant impact on the French colonies within the "French Community". As everyone knows, in order to ease the national independence movement of the colonial people, the French colonialists forcibly imposed the new colonial shackles of the so-called "Community" on the people of twelve colonies including French West Africa and Equatorial Africa, as well as Madagascar, in 1959. The so-called "French Community" is only a disguised form of French colonial rule. Precisely for this reason, Senegal and Sudan first formed a federation after the establishment of the "Community", demanding to gradually get rid of the colonial rule of the "Community" and become independent. The independence of the Mali Federation now further shows that the "French Community" and the like cannot last long, and its rapid disintegration is inevitable.

    The Chinese people have always had deep sympathy and concern for the national independence cause of the people of African countries. The Chinese people also have deep friendship with the people of the Mali Federation. Although China and the Mali Federation are thousands of miles apart, and have not been able to establish friendly relations in the past due to the obstruction of imperialism and colonialism, we firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the Mali Federation will grow day by day in the future.

### 祝贺马里联邦的独立

    祝贺马里联邦的独立
    今天，在已经开始升起自由曙光的非洲，又一个新的国家——马里联邦，宣告独立了。中国人民与世界各国爱好自由独立的人民一起，为这一喜讯感到高兴，并向马里联邦人民致以衷心的祝贺。我国周恩来总理在致马里联邦贺电中，代表我国政府和人民，祝马里联邦人民在维护民族独立的事业中取得新的成就。
    马里联邦的人民是英勇的人民。他们为了民族独立，曾经进行了长期的艰苦斗争。从十九世纪中叶起，法国殖民者就侵入了位于西非的塞内加尔与苏丹，即现在的马里联邦，接着在那里建立了殖民统治。这个地区的人民从法国殖民者入侵的第一天起，就对法国殖民军进行了英勇的抵抗。差不多十九世纪的整个下半世纪，一直没有停止过这种武装抵抗运动。第二次世界大战爆发后，随着塞内加尔和苏丹的工人阶级的成长，工人运动就与民族独立运动结合在一起，成为冲击法国殖民统治的强大力量。1951年在苏丹巴马科召开的法属西非各地工会代表会议，明确提出要从殖民制度下解放出来的斗争纲领。1958年，塞内加尔的工会在黑非洲工会总联合会的号召下，号召在戴高乐宪法的公民投票中投反对票，要求独立。工会、政党和其他组织还举行了民族独立周，并在戴高乐访问达喀尔的时候，举行了要求戴高乐滚回去和要求民族独立的示威游行。马里联邦今天的独立，正是塞内加尔和苏丹人民长期斗争的结果。
    殖民主义者经常扬言，殖民地人民只有依靠它们，才能够活下去，才能够过“好日子”。这种谬论是不值一驳的。事实上，正是由于法国殖民主义的残酷掠夺与剥削，才使马里联邦人民长期以来过着极其困苦的生活。我们相信，在马里联邦宣布独立以后，只要全联邦人民继续高举独立的旗帜，继续为彻底清除殖民主义势力，发展民族独立的事业而斗争，是完全能够通过自己的辛勤劳动，在自己的土地上建设起美好的生活的。
    马里联盟现在的独立也是在非洲民族独立运动不断高涨的形势推动下取得的。非洲一个又一个新国家的诞生，特别是几内亚共和国的出现，对于“法兰西共同体”内的法国殖民地不能不发生重大的影响。大家知道，法国殖民者为了缓和殖民地人民的民族独立运动，在1959年硬把所谓“共同体”的新的殖民枷锁强加在法属西非和赤道非洲，以及马达加斯加等十二个殖民地人民的身上。所谓“法兰西共同体”只不过是法国殖民统治的变相形式而已。正因为如此，塞内加尔和苏丹在“共同体”建立以后首先结成联邦，要求逐步摆脱“共同体”的殖民统治而独立。现在马里联邦的独立，进一步表明了“法兰西共同体”之类是不可能维持长久的，它的迅速瓦解是不可避免的。
    中国人民一贯对非洲各国人民的民族独立事业抱有深切同情和关怀。中国人民对于马里联邦的人民同样怀有深挚的友谊。中国和马里联邦虽然相距数万里，并且在过去一直由于帝国主义和殖民主义的阻隔，而不能建立起友好交往的关系；但是，我们深信，中国人民和马里联邦人民之间的友谊今后将会与日俱增。
