The pineapple trees in Taiwan, are they blossoming again? The tangerine groves in Taiwan, are they bearing fruit again? The sugarcane fields in Taiwan, are they filled with sweet juice again? The farmers in Taiwan, are they pounding the newly harvested rice again? ... But, I know the pineapples, tangerines, sugarcane, and rice, everything in Taiwan, is in anger! Is weeping… The beautiful land, trampled by the iron hooves of the USA; the island of our motherland, transformed into an American military base. Look! Fifty thousand American pirates, one hundred and thirty American warships, four hundred and fifty American airplanes, are rampaging here, conducting "military exercises" here, probing "forced beach landings" here, testing "joint combat capabilities" here… Look! The American Secretary of the Navy Frank, the American Secretary of the Air Force Dudley Sharp, the American Seventh Fleet Commander Griffin, the American First Corps Commander Stork, are chewing gum here, holding binoculars here, they are cursing and scolding, using Pentagon-made whips to lash the Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers…

The beautiful land, is in anger! Is weeping; the island of our motherland, is being humiliated! Is being bullied! Shame! How many innocent girls have fallen to become "adopted daughters" to be played with; how many wives of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers have become prostitutes in the American "military brothels". Pain! Twenty-three-year-old Chen Hua, in the residence of the American Thomas, was doused with gasoline and burned alive; young children, picking up hot shell casings on the firing range, were blown apart by American bandits! Resentment! In the "Judicial Building" and "Criminal Experiment Building" in Taipei, how many patriotic compatriots are having their tendons severed and their skin peeled off; in the concentration camp on Orchid Island, how many revolutionary youths are dying in agony from electric shocks…

No, no, Taiwan, our motherland, is definitely not an "American aircraft carrier"; the beautiful island is definitely not a chicken to be slaughtered. The people are roaring! The people are clenching their arms, smashing the American embassy in Taiwan; breaking through the American "military restricted zones"; Yangming Park, where "Chinese are not allowed," has seen three thousand people bravely gathering…

No, no, Taiwan, our motherland, is definitely not a gold coin of Wall Street; the beautiful island is definitely not a cover for American aggression in Asia. Six hundred million people! Trembling the earth, thousands upon thousands of artillery muzzles, pointing at the rampant American imperialism in Taiwan; thousands upon thousands of arms, reaching out to the brothers and sisters suffering in Taiwan. We must plant the red flag that illuminates the mountains and rivers of our motherland on the summit of Jade Mountain; we must sing "Socialism is Good" by the Tamsui River…

Taiwan, our motherland! Beautiful island, the days of liberation are not far away, the happy moments are about to arrive! People who have wandered for many years will set sail to return to their long-separated hometowns on the mainland. In Keelung Harbor, batches of machines transported from the Bund of Shanghai will be unloaded. In the shade of Sun Moon Lake, the laughter of workers and the People's Liberation Army celebrating together will echo. In the suburbs of Taoyuan County, farmers will pick up new plows made of the motherland's steel. Unyielding warriors who have walked out of concentration camps will come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. The Gaoshan people will also elect their own representatives to meet the most beloved Chairman Mao…

Taiwan, our motherland! Beautiful island, the days of liberation are not far away, the happy moments are about to arrive, fight bravely! Stand heroically, before us is victory, victory, victory…

    红旗要插上玉山顶
    顾工台湾的凤梨树，又在开花了吗？台湾的柑橘林，又在结果了吗？台湾的甘蔗林，又灌饱甜蜜的汁液了吗？台湾的农民们，又在舂新收的稻米了吗？……可是，我知道凤梨、柑橘，甘蔗和稻米，台湾的一切一切，都在愤怒啊！都在哭泣……美丽的土地，踏上了USA的铁蹄；祖国的岛屿，变成了美国的军事基地。看哪！五万名美国海盗，一百三十艘美国军舰，四百五十架美国飞机，在这里横冲直撞，在这里进行“军事演习”，在这里试探“滩头强行登陆”，在这里测验“联合作战能力”……看哪！美国的海军部长弗兰克，美国的空军部长德利·夏普，美国的第七舰队司令格里芬，美国的第一军团司令斯托克，在这里嚼着口香糖，在这里举着观测镜，他们咀咒着、训叱着，用五角大楼特制的皮鞭，抽打着蒋军的军官和士兵
    ……。美丽的土地，在愤怒啊！在哭泣；祖国的岛屿，在受辱啊！在受欺！羞耻啊！多少善良的姑娘，沦落成任人玩弄的“养女”；多少蒋军的妻子，变成美军“军中乐园”的娼妓。苦痛啊！二十三岁的陈花，在美军汤姆斯的住宅里，被浇上汽油活活烧断了气；年幼的孩子们，在打靶场拾滚烫的炮弹皮，被美国强盗炸得四肢分离！忿恨啊！在台北的“司法大厦”，和“刑事实验大楼”里，有多少爱国的同胞，在被剔断筋骨、在被剥皮；在兰屿的集中营里，又有多少革命的青年，在电刑中惨痛地死去……。不，不，祖国的台湾，决不是“美国的航空母舰”；美丽的宝岛，决不是任人宰割的小鸡。人民在怒吼啊！人民挽紧手臂，捣毁了美国驻台大使馆；冲破了美国的“军事禁区”；“华人不准入内”的阳明公园，三万多人在这里勇敢地汇
  聚！……不，不，祖国的台湾，决不是华尔街的一枚金币；美丽的宝岛，决不是美国侵略亚洲的掩体。六亿人民啊！惊天动地，千千万万炮口，指向在台湾猖狂的美帝；千千万万手臂，伸向在台湾受难的兄弟。一定要在玉山峰顶，插上照亮祖国山河的红旗；一定要在淡水河畔，高唱“社会主义好”的歌曲……祖国的台湾啊！美丽的岛屿，欢呼解放的日子不远了，幸福的时刻将要到来了！流浪多年的人，将要扬帆返回大陆上久别的乡里。在基隆港口，将要卸下一批批从黄浦江边运来的机器。日月潭的林荫中，将传出工人和解放军联欢的笑
    语。桃园县的近郊，农民将拿起祖国钢铁的新犁。从集中营走出来的不屈战士，将到北京城来参加国庆观礼。高山族也将选出自己的代表，来见见最敬爱的毛主席……祖国的台湾啊！美丽的岛屿，欢呼解放的日子不远了，幸福的时刻将要到来了，勇敢地斗争吧！英雄地挺立，我们的面前是胜利，胜利，胜
  利……。
