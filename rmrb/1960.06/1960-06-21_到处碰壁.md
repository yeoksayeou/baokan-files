    Running Into Walls Everywhere
    Mei Lanfang
    Eisenhower, harboring great ambitions and conspiracies, crossed the ocean to Asia, intending to use a hypocritical facade to strengthen his oppression of the people of Asian countries and maintain America's aggressive foothold in Asia. Let's take a look at how the people of Asia welcomed this "distinguished guest"!
    First, the Japanese people gave Eisenhower's advance man, Hagerty, a blow to the head, and he fled in disgrace. A nationwide, roaring anti-American wave of anger in Japan finally frightened Eisenhower, forcing him to abandon his original plan to visit Japan. Now that Eisenhower has arrived in Taiwan, I think that the compatriots in Taiwan will understand that his intentions are not good, and all patriotic Chinese people should unite and wage a resolute struggle against the US imperialist aggressors.
    I visited the United States thirty years ago and know that the American people love peace and hate war. Only Eisenhower and the Pentagon's handful of war-mongers vainly attempt to use threats, inducements, and various deceptive tactics to achieve their dream of dominating the world with one hand covering the sky. However, the clear examples of the fallen Syngman Rhee and Menderes, and the tottering Nobusuke Kishi, all demonstrate that the warmongers are at the end of their rope, running into walls everywhere, and are extremely isolated.

    到处碰壁
    梅兰芳
    艾森豪威尔抱着极大的野心、阴谋，远渡重洋，来到亚洲，打算以伪善的面貌来加强他对亚洲各国人民的压迫，维持美国在亚洲的侵略阵地。我们来看一看亚洲人民是怎样欢迎这个“贵宾”的吧！
    首先是日本人民给艾森豪威尔的先行官哈格蒂当头一棒，抱头鼠窜而去。日本全国性，一个轰轰烈烈的反美怒潮，终于吓退了艾森豪威尔，使他不得不放弃了访日的原定计划。艾森豪威尔到了台湾，我想，台湾同胞们也会懂得他的来意是不善的，一切有爱国心的中国人，都应该团结起来，同美帝国主义侵略者作坚决的斗争。
    我三十年前就到过美国，知道美国人民是爱好和平，厌恶战争的。只有艾森豪威尔以及五角大楼这一撮战争贩子，妄想用威胁利诱等种种欺骗手段来达成一手遮天、独霸世界的迷梦。可是，已经倒下去的李承晚和曼德列斯、摇摇欲坠的岸信介这些鲜明的事例，都可以说明好战分子已经日暮途穷，到处碰壁，十分孤立了。
