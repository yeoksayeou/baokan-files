Xinhua News Agency, 31st - Jakarta Dispatch: While influential groups in Indonesia are intensifying anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, the broad masses of Indonesian people and overseas Chinese are expressing their deep friendship through various means. This friendship has developed and taken root in the long-term harmonious coexistence and common struggles of the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese.

News from Bali says that on May 2nd, the Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association of Bali Ling warmly saw off the returning overseas Chinese from Coffee Village to Haikou to board their ships. On the evening of April 30th, Indonesian friends in Bali Ling also held a farewell party for the returning overseas Chinese. The venue was packed and full of friendly atmosphere.

On April 28th, when the returning overseas Chinese from Coffee Village set off to the temporary reception center of the Bali Ling Chinese Chamber of Commerce to await their return home, the Indonesian people from neighboring villages came to see them off with tears in their eyes.

“Hoping that the friendship between us develops into friendship between nations.”

District Chief Wayan Galer tightly grasped the hand of Rao Huanghui, the leader of the returning overseas Chinese, and said: “Hoping that the friendship between us develops into friendship between nations.” Rao Huanghui said: "After we return to our motherland, we will work for the country during the day; but in the quiet of the night, we will miss the beautiful island of Bali and the good people on the island.”

On April 30th, a delegation of five groups consisting of the Batang Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association, the People’s Cultural Association, the Farmers' Front, the Awakened Women's Association, and the People's Youth League presented gifts to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Buger, the representative of the delegation, said: "When you arrive in China and see the ancient Chinese coins and the lychees of Guangdong, please do not forget: your ancestors brought these things to Bali long ago, and they have taken root in Bali and will be passed down from generation to generation."

“The broad masses of Indonesian people are friendly to overseas Chinese.”

News from North Sumatra is also full of Indonesian people's sentiments. Subroto, Chairman of the Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association of Siantar, said when he rushed to Medan to see off the affected overseas Chinese, "Overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the development of Indonesia and Indonesia's struggle for national independence. The broad masses of Indonesian people are friendly to overseas Chinese.”

Umar, Chairman of the Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association of Medan, said while comforting the distressed overseas Chinese: The deep friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people cannot be destroyed by anyone.

During the farewell, people talked about the Five Ancestors Temple in the suburbs of Medan, where five young Chinese workers from Chaozhou are enshrined as models of resistance against the Dutch colonialists. People also recalled the concentration camp established by the Japanese imperialists in Siantar, where ninety out of five hundred and forty-five patriots who fought for Indonesian national independence were Chinese. People also talked about Bagan Siapi-api fishing ground on the east coast of Sumatra, one of the world's largest fishing grounds, and the tobacco plantations in the Medan area, where many overseas Chinese and Indonesian laborers worked together to develop Indonesia's economy and forged deep friendships.

Many returning overseas Chinese recounted the friendships they had established with the Indonesian people during their long residence in Indonesia and cherished these friendships. Zhang Yasi, an old returned overseas Chinese from Wanayasa near Bandung, said that when he arrived in Wanayasa fifty years ago, it was very desolate. There were two overseas Chinese families at that time, which later increased to more than twenty. They ran small businesses there and contributed to the economic exchanges between urban and rural areas. Later, in the war of Dutch imperialism against Indonesia, Wanayasa was burned down. The overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people worked hard to rebuild it.

Recently, Li Shuncai, a young returned overseas Chinese from Bangka-Belitung, said that his Indonesian friends reluctantly gave him a xiao flute, hoping that whenever he played the flute, he would think of the friendship of his Indonesian friends. He played Indonesian songs with this flute.

Indonesian friends shed tears of sympathy for the affected overseas Chinese

Lin Nanmao, a small businessman from Mentok, Bangka, saw that the local people's pepper gardens had been destroyed by the Japanese invaders after the Japanese surrender, and they were living in poverty and had no funds or seedlings to restore production. He tried his best to buy seedlings from other places to help them restore production. He also taught them the experience of growing grains brought from his motherland. Therefore, the Indonesian people regarded Lin Nanmao as their own brother. In December last year, the relevant Indonesian authorities forced the overseas Chinese in Mentok to relocate. Lin Nanmao had to close his business, and many Indonesian friends shed tears of sympathy for Lin Nanmao.

The deep friendship between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people is built with blood and life.

Li Mei, a returned overseas Chinese who once served as the chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Women's Association, pointed out in a speech the friendship forged between the broad masses of Chinese and Indonesian people in the historical struggle against Dutch, Japanese and other imperialists. She said that in the successive struggles against common enemies, overseas Chinese and Indonesian people have always fought side by side, sharing weal and woe, and have written a moving and magnificent poem for the friendly history of the Chinese and Indonesian people.

She cited the historically famous anti-Dutch struggle, the "Red Creek Incident," saying that the overseas Chinese residing in Java were forced to carry out an armed struggle against the cruel persecution of the Dutch colonialists, and fought side by side with the Indonesian insurgents of Zapala to resist the common enemy. In this battle, a large number of Indonesian insurgents were killed in action. The blood of the overseas Chinese also stained the Red Creek red.

She said: In 1943, when the Japanese fascists invaded Indonesia, the broad masses of overseas Chinese and Indonesian people fought bravely against Japan together; many overseas Chinese sacrificed on the battlefield or were brutally murdered by the Japanese bandits. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, more than 1,000 people in the areas of Pontianak and Singkawang in West Kalimantan were buried alive by the Japanese fascists. To this day, a monument erected to commemorate these murdered overseas Chinese still stands near the Durian Port Airport in East Mempawah.

She said: After Indonesia declared its independence in 1945, the broad masses of overseas Chinese enthusiastically supported Indonesia's independence struggle. A large number of overseas Chinese participated in the famous "Battle of Surabaya" in 1945. She said: According to incomplete statistics from relevant parties at the time, thousands of overseas Chinese gloriously sacrificed in this battle. Chinese women also worked actively in the Indonesian Red Cross Society together with Indonesian women.

Ms. Li Mei also listed facts to illustrate that overseas Chinese contributed money and efforts to support Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian and suppress armed rebel groups.

Ms. Li Mei said: The deep friendship between the overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people is built with blood and life. It not only has a long-term and extensive impact, but also has an unshakable foundation. The desperate destruction of this friendship by imperialism and some Indonesian elements with ulterior motives can only expose their reactionary faces of hostility towards the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people. The friendship between the Chinese people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people will surely be further developed. (Picture attached)
People in many parts of Indonesia held farewell parties one after another, warmly seeing off the overseas Chinese who had been friendly and loving in peacetime. The picture shows the chairman of the Indonesian trade union of an Indonesian plantation shouting at the farewell party: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people!"

    反华排华逆流破坏不了共同斗争中培育的深厚友谊
    印度尼西亚人民热情送别归国华侨
    新华社31日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚有势力集团加紧反华排华活动的时候，印度尼西亚广大人民和华侨互相用各种各样的方式表达他们之间的深厚友谊，这种友谊是在印度尼西亚人民同华侨长期和睦相处和共同的斗争中发展起来和扎下了深根的。
    来自巴厘岛的消息说，5月2日，巴厘陵印度尼西亚—中国友好协会热烈欢送从咖啡村来巴厘陵的归国华侨赴海口登轮。4月30日晚上，巴厘陵印度尼西亚友人还举行晚会为归国华侨送行。会场挤满了人，洋溢着友好的气氛。
    4月28日，当咖啡村归国华侨动身到巴厘陵中华总商会临时招待所候轮归国的时候，邻村的印度尼西亚人民都热泪盈眶地来送行。
    “希望我们之间的友谊发展成为民族之间的友谊”
    区长哇扬加勒尔紧握着归国华侨领队饶煌辉的手说：“希望我们之间的友谊发展成为民族之间的友谊。”饶煌辉说：“当我们回到祖国之后，白天，我们为国家工作；但是，在平静的夜晚，我们要怀念秀丽的巴厘岛和岛上的好人民。”
    4月30日，巴塘印度尼西亚—中国友好协会、人民文化协会、农民阵线、觉醒妇女会和人民青年团五个团体组成的慰问团到中华总商会赠送礼品。慰问团代表布格尔说：“当您们到达了中国以后，看到了中国的古老的铜钱和广东的荔枝，请您们不要忘记：这些东西您们的祖先很早就已经带到了巴厘，并且已经在巴厘生了根，将世世代代地传下去”。
    “印度尼西亚广大人民是同华侨友好的”
    来自北苏门答腊的消息也充满着印度尼西亚人民的情谊。先达印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席苏布罗托在赶到棉兰为受难的华侨送行时说，“华侨对印度尼西亚的发展和印度尼西亚争取民族独立的斗争都作出了巨大的贡献。印度尼西亚广大人民是同华侨友好的。”
    棉兰印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席乌马尔在慰问难侨时说：印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的深厚友谊是任何人都破坏不了的。
    在依依惜别的时候，人们谈到了棉兰市郊的五祖庙，在那里恭奉着五个潮州籍青年华工——反抗荷兰殖民者的表率。人们也回忆日本帝国主义者在先达建立的集中营，在那里曾经被日本法西斯所囚禁的五百四十五位为印度尼西亚民族独立而斗争的志士中，有九十名是华人。人们还谈论到世界上最大的渔场之一的苏门答腊东海岸巴眼亚比渔场，棉兰一带的烟草园等，那里有许多华侨同印度尼西亚劳动人民一道，用辛勤的劳动开发了印度尼西亚的经济，并且结下了深情厚谊。
    许多归国华侨陈述了他们在印度尼西亚长期居住期间同印度尼西亚人民建立起来的友情，并且怀念这种友情。从万隆近郊万夜兰回到祖国的老归侨张亚四说，五十年前他到万夜兰的时候，那里很荒凉。那里的华侨当时有两户，后来增到二十多户，他们在那里经营小商贩，为城乡经济交流尽了力量。后来，在荷兰帝国主义侵略印度尼西亚的战争中，万夜兰被烧毁了。华侨同印度尼西亚人民胼手胝足地把它重新建设起来。
    最近，从邦加烈港回来的青年归侨李顺才说，印度尼西亚朋友依依不舍地送给他一支洞箫，希望他一吹箫就想起印度尼西亚朋友的友谊。他用这支箫吹印度尼西亚的歌曲。
    印度尼西亚友人为受难华侨流下了同情之泪
    文岛马影归侨小商人林南茂，在日本投降后他看见当地人民的胡椒园都给日本侵略者摧残了，生活困苦，没有资金和种苗来恢复生产，他便想尽办法从外地去买种苗回来帮助他们恢复生产。他还把从祖国带去的种植五谷的经验传授给他们。因此，印度尼西亚人民把林南茂当作自己的兄弟手足。去年12月，印度尼西亚有关当局迫令马影华侨迁离。林南茂只好关门停业，许多印度尼西亚友人都为林南茂流下同情之泪。
    华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚友谊是用鲜血和生命建筑起来的
    曾任雅加达中华妇女协会主席的归侨李梅女士在一次谈话中指出了中国和印度尼西亚广大人民之间在历史上反对荷兰、日本等帝国主义的斗争中凝结起来的友谊。她说，在历次反对共同敌人的斗争中，华侨和印度尼西亚人民始终并肩作战，共甘苦、共患难，为中国和印度尼西亚人民的友好历史写下了可歌可泣的壮丽诗篇。
    她举出历史上有名的反荷斗争“红溪事件”说，侨居爪哇的华侨被迫进行反对荷兰殖民者残酷迫害的武装斗争，同札巴拉的印度尼西亚起义军并肩反抗共同的敌人。在这次战斗中，大批印度尼西亚起义军阵亡。华侨的血也染红了红溪。
    她说：1943年，日本法西斯侵占印度尼西亚时，广大华侨和印度尼西亚人民一道奋勇抗日；许多华侨在战场上牺牲或惨遭了日寇的杀戮。日寇投降前夕，西加里曼丹坤甸、山口洋一带有一千多人被日本法西斯活埋。至今在东万律榴槤港飞机场附近还矗立着为纪念这些被害华侨而设的纪念碑。
    她说：1945年印度尼西亚宣告独立后，广大华侨热烈支持印度尼西亚的独立斗争。大批华侨参加了1945年著名的“泗水保卫战”。她说：据当时有关方面的不完全统计，在这次战役中光荣牺牲的华侨达数千人。中国妇女也同印度尼西亚妇女在一起，在印度尼西亚的红十字会里积极工作。
    李梅女士还列举事实‘说明华侨出钱出力支持印度尼西亚争取收复西伊里安和镇压武装叛乱集团的斗争。
    李梅女士说：华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚友谊是用鲜血和生命建筑起来的，它不仅有长远和广泛的影响，而且有不可动摇的基础。帝国主义和印度尼西亚一部分别有用心的分子对这种友谊的竭力破坏，只能暴露他们敌视中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好的反动面目。中国人民和广大华侨与印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊必将得到进一步的发展。（附图片）
    印度尼西亚许多地区的人民纷纷举行欢送会，热情送别平时友好相爱的华侨。图为印度尼西亚苏门答腊一个园丘的印度尼西亚工会主席在欢送会上高呼：“中国和印度尼西亚人民友谊长存！”
