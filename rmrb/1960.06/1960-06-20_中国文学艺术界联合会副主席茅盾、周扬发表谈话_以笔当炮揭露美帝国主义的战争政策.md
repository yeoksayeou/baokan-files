Xinhua News Agency, 19th - Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, Vice-Chairmen of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, jointly issued a statement opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, saying that the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued an open letter to compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu on the 17th. Subsequently, the earth-shaking roar of artillery fire set off a powerful anti-American storm in the Taiwan Strait. This solemn proclamation and righteous action fully expressed the support of our great 650 million Chinese people for the just struggle of the people of Asian countries and our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip, fully demonstrated the Chinese people's contempt and disdain for the chieftain of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, and fully demonstrated our firm stance in safeguarding the integrity of our motherland's territory and defending world peace. All the people of Asia and countries all over the world will applaud this. We Chinese literary and art workers warmly support this proclamation and the anti-American armed demonstration!

They said that the notorious Eisenhower, who traveled thousands of miles from the eastern side of the Pacific to the western side of the Pacific, did not come with good intentions. The purpose of his visit was to maintain the U.S. aggressive position in Asia and to strengthen its oppression and rule over the people of Asian countries. But contrary to his wishes, the people of Asia and countries around the world are standing on the same battle line, opposing the common enemy—U.S. imperialism. This chief culprit of U.S. imperialism has already seen the people there opposing him in the Philippines. He was also given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people, which gave U.S. imperialism a major blow. This convincingly shows that no matter how rampant imperialism and its running dogs are, as long as the people unite and fight resolutely, they can defeat all its conspiracies and tricks. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we will surely be able to defeat imperialism and their running dogs and achieve lasting world peace."

They said that on the 18th, Eisenhower arrived in Taiwan. Taiwan is our country's territory, and Eisenhower's arrival is a blatant invasion of our country's territory, a shameless interference in our country's internal affairs, and a destruction of peace in Asia and the world. We express our great anger at this sinister activity of the head of U.S. imperialism and resolutely protest! Eisenhower is our enemy, and also the enemy of all patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. We must not tolerate this bandit coming to Taiwan to commit evil! We believe that all patriotic Chinese people should unite and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and fight for the liberation of Taiwan!

Mao Dun and Zhou Yang said that we Chinese literary and art workers have always opposed U.S. imperialism. We must take further action, using pens as cannons, and using the special weapons of literature and art to expose the war policies and aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, support the anti-American patriotic struggles of the people of Asia and all countries in the world, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾、周扬发表谈话
    以笔当炮揭露美帝国主义的战争政策
    新华社19日讯　中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾、周扬联合发表为反对美帝侵略谈话说，我国人民解放军福建前线司令部，17日发表了告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，随后，震天动地的隆隆炮声，掀起了台湾海峡强大的反美风暴。这一庄严文告和正义的行动，充分表达了我们伟大中国六亿五千万人民，对亚洲各国人民以及我台澎金马爱国同胞，反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争的支持，充分表示了中国人民对美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视，充分表明了我们维护祖国领土完整以及保卫世界和平的坚决立场。所有亚洲和全世界各国人民，都会拍手称快。我们中国文学艺术工作者热烈拥护这个文告和反美武装大示威！
    他们说，臭名远扬的艾森豪威尔，这次不远千里从太平洋东边跑到太平洋西边来，是不怀一点好意的，他来的目的就是维持美国在亚洲的侵略阵地，加强它对亚洲各国人民的压迫和统治。可是事与愿违，亚洲和世界各国人民站在一条战线上，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义。这个美帝国主义的罪魁祸首，已在菲律宾看到那里的人民反对他的颜色。又吃了日本人民闭门羹，这就给了美帝国主义以重大的打击。这令人信服的表明：不论帝国主义和它的走狗如何猖狂，只要人民团结起来坚决斗争，就能击败它的一切阴谋诡计。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说：“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗，取得世界的持久和平。”
    他们说，18日，艾森豪威尔到达台湾。台湾是我国领土，艾森豪威尔的到来，就是对我国领土的公然侵犯，就是无耻干涉我国的内政，就是对亚洲和世界和平的破坏。对于美帝国主义头子这种罪恶活动，我们表示极大的愤怒，并坚决抗议！艾森豪威尔是我们的敌人，也是台澎金马一切爱国同胞的敌人，决不能容忍这个强盗到台湾为非作歹！我们相信：一切有爱国心的中国人，都应当团结起来坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，为解放台湾而斗争！
    茅盾、周扬说，我们中国文学艺术工作者们，一贯反对美帝国主义，我们要进一步行动起来，以笔当炮，运用文学艺术的特殊武器，揭露美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，支持亚洲和全世界各国人民的反美爱国斗争，打倒美帝国主义！
