    Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary Romanioli delivered a speech at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the 7th. Romanioli first expressed his complete agreement with the general line and objectives of struggling for comprehensive disarmament, easing tensions, and peaceful coexistence as proposed in the report.
    He said, we believe it is particularly necessary to highlight the following points:
    First, the aggravation of the international situation.
    He believes that reactionary forces are carrying out reactionary offensives in various countries, and it is now more possible to take measures for peaceful coexistence.
    The imperialist policies, through acts of aggression and provocation, have temporarily caused the failure of the summit meeting. They continue to keep the world on the brink of war, and world reactionary forces are using the failure of the Paris meeting, which they themselves created, to restore the Cold War and carry out reactionary offensives in various countries. The whole world is threatened by enormous danger.
    He believes that the seriousness of the situation should not lead us to pessimistic estimates of international events. On the contrary, now more than at any time in the past, it is more possible to take victorious actions throughout the world in order to force the convening of a summit meeting and to take measures for disarmament, easing tensions, peaceful coexistence and peace. The balance of power has already been analyzed here, and I do not want to repeat what has already been said. However, it should also be emphasized that the policy of easing tensions has achieved great success. This policy has expanded the struggle to force imperialism and reactionary forces to accept peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Although the summit meeting has temporarily failed, imperialism has failed to stop this progress.
    He said, it is not our task to study from this perspective the tremendous development of socialist countries in economic construction, the development of worker welfare, culture, science, and socialist democracy. However, the inspiring development of these countries is inseparable from their dedication to the policy of striving for easing tensions and peace.
    He said, in these few days, we have personally experienced the experience of the great Chinese people.
  We better understand the necessity of studying this reality, because this reality is an educational experience for workers and people all over the world. He believes that China's experience is correct because it comes from a policy of peace.
    He said that it should also be considered what has happened and is happening all over the world under the general impetus of easing tensions, universal disarmament and peaceful coexistence.
    We believe that the imperialist aggressor forces, due to their policy of being increasingly isolated, have greatly encouraged the heroic struggles of the people and workers of South Korea, Turkey, Japan and South America, and have also led the Cuban revolution to a great victory. It has also encouraged and accelerated the African people's victorious struggle to demand independence and abolish the colonial system. Even in capitalist countries, the policies of easing tensions and peaceful coexistence have made and are making decisive contributions to the working class's struggle for class demands and development in the struggle against monopoly capital, demanding true democracy, and the policies of social and political alliances.
    He believes that the great united struggles of the French and Italian working classes are for wage demands and are carried out within the economic and political structures of the two countries. This is the result that the struggle to achieve easing tensions has already brought to workers all over the world, and even imperialism cannot deprive us of these achievements even with provocative and aggressive acts, such as leading to the failure of the summit conference. These achievements are all ours, and even if they are threatened today, they all belong to us. The kind of achievements that can liberate and unite the new and great forces within the proletariat and the people to force the imperialists and reactionaries to accept the policies of easing international tensions, disarmament and peaceful coexistence are still effective.
    Romanioli said that obviously, in our ranks, especially in the initial stage, some people believed that international tensions could be eased without struggle, and some people believed that the policy of easing tensions was a compromise to consolidate the status quo. Even some workers think so. Some people think that the Soviet Union's abandonment of military superiority and missiles is too naive, and that the Soviet Union's policy of easing international tensions is a compromise with imperialism, and that workers in capitalist countries will be left to the mercy of their bosses. The bosses are desperately spreading this wrong idea.
    We have struggled against similar positions because this position is helping the imperialists and bosses. The policies of coexistence and disarmament are achieved through solidarity and struggle, not through abandoning solidarity and struggle. In all countries, the struggle for coexistence is organically linked with the national goals of the proletariat, the working people, and the people: independence, economic and social liberation and development, democracy and freedom.
    He said that we believe that the correctness of the policy of easing tensions also lies in its unity and universality. In fact, this policy not only does not make any concessions to imperialism, but isolates and paralyzes it. Any other policy of the workers and their unified trade unions is harmful to peace, isolates the working class, and makes its division permanent, which is in the interests of imperialism and reactionaries. When we say that imperialism is weak and that the forces of peace are dominant, we are talking about an extremely encouraging fact. But don't draw simplistic conclusions. Imperialism has been weakened due to the fundamental and historically significant achievements of the working class in socialist countries, the independence achieved by the nations formerly oppressed by colonialism, the struggles of the people in colonial countries, and the actions of the working class in capitalist countries. Imperialism is weak because the policies of all progressive forces have constrained it. It will continue to weaken, and today we can be sure that its historical prospect is extinction. He believes that imperialism is not everywhere as weak, and it can still do bad things in many parts of the world. The working class and the working people should not underestimate the strength of the enemy, because underestimating the strength of the enemy will both weaken the struggle of the working class and its allies, and will make them make adventurous decisions and take wrong measures.
    He said that therefore, it seems that we should draw infinite confidence and the power to promote new upsurges in the struggle from a deep conviction. This belief is that: détente, disarmament and peaceful coexistence are correct, and it can maximize the mobilization of the strength of the working class and trade union organizations and democratic forces in the world and at home.
    He said that in Italy, as in other capitalist countries, there are great possibilities and necessities to carry out the struggle of the working class. The struggle against imperialism is inextricably linked to the struggle against monopoly capitalism.
    He believes that if we adopt a one-sided solution to the issue of the struggle for peace or only guide this struggle by conducting propaganda, we cannot achieve this result. The expansion and strengthening of the struggle can be guaranteed by the independent and autonomous initiatives of the working class in various countries under the guidance of the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    He said that in capitalist countries, the task is difficult, but it is necessary and urgent.
    Imperialism and the Italian monopoly capital forces mainly operate in the following three main directions:
    He said that the first is mainly a political direction, which is to tie Italy to the international imperialist front through the North Atlantic Treaty and the establishment of military and rocket bases for the US military. This serious fact requires us to oppose military and rocket bases to the maximum extent, because these bases constitute a danger of threatening our country and socialist countries.
    Italian workers guarantee to eliminate US aggressive bases
    The U-2 aircraft incident proves that, even in Italy, there are still bases for this type of aircraft to take off and conduct exercises. We express to the comrades of the Soviet trade union, and through them, to all the workers of the Soviet Union, the solemn guarantee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Italian workers once again, that we will eliminate all provocative and aggressive bases set up in our country.
    He said that the second direction of the activities of the large monopoly capitalists is to prevent real economic development by freezing workers' wages and exacerbating social imbalances. In our country, on the one hand, highly industrialized enterprises are flourishing, while on the other hand, more enterprises are stagnating.
    He said that the struggle to demand wage increases has become a major condition for containing the activities of monopoly capital. In view of the enormous differences and imbalances in our country, we cannot limit ourselves to demanding higher meager wages for all workers. If we do so, it will benefit the concentration of monopoly capital and the activities of wooing and discriminating against the working class and their unified trade unions. We do not agree to calculate wages based on output. He believes that he hopes that trade unions can penetrate all aspects of labor-management relations and pay attention to the social impact caused by the compartmentalized combination of capital in various departments and enterprises. This kind of route guarantees that our trade union has greater strength, not only in terms of labor-management relations, but also in terms of economic demands. He said that we are in favor of these goals, in favor of the major issues of implementing people's democratic supervision of the national economy, and reforming the economic structure, especially land reform and extensive nationalization. The struggle for disarmament is not only demanding in Italy that the money used for armaments be used for productive purposes, but it is also a struggle against the current structure of the monopoly capital regime and striving for new guidelines for economic and social policies.
    He said that the anti-worker and anti-democratic direction that monopoly capitalists want to follow is their third direction. These bosses want to enjoy complete freedom in the factory and in the whole country. The struggle we have been waging and the struggle we will work harder to wage is against the capitalist's consistent attack on the freedom of workers and against their attack on the rights of trade unions. This struggle is one of the fundamental goals of the Italian people's struggle for true democracy.
    He said that in the above three directions of the Italian class struggle, an organic line of action consistent with the autonomous and national struggles of the Italian proletariat and our Labor Federation has emerged.
    When Romanioli talked about the issue of colonies and underdeveloped countries and their relationship with workers in capitalist countries, he said that he agreed with Zakaria's report. He said that Italy faces the vast African continent across the sea. The heroic struggles of the people of Algeria and Black Africa are a powerful factor in inspiring struggle, and this is a refreshing breeze. We should take various forms to strengthen our relations and our solidarity to support the struggle of the colonial people and the recently liberated people for political and economic independence. Because this is also a struggle to liberate all mankind. We should unconditionally and unreservedly support trade union unity and the new upsurge of autonomy in the African and Latin American continental alliances. Trade union unity and autonomy are two goals fiercely opposed by the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions", whose purpose is to maintain imperialist rule in Africa and Latin America.
    He said that trade unions in capitalist countries should strengthen their solidarity with the masses who are fighting for independence. These trade unions should not be indifferent or take a neutral attitude on the issue of economic and political relations between highly industrialized capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries. They should, as in the past, but with a new upsurge, demand in their struggles that: economic and political ties should be established with the forces that truly represent the colonial and former colonial countries, not with the colonialist forces and their economic and political agents, but with the true representatives of the people. They should struggle for the establishment of political and economic ties on the basis of equality of rights, so as to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and expose the conspiracies of neo-capitalism. He believes that this is in line with the wishes of the people who demand industrialization and demand the transformation of agriculture and the entire society.
    He said at the end of his speech: Long live the unity of the world working class and working people who are fighting for peaceful coexistence and for peace!

### 意大利总工会书记罗马尼奥利的发言

    意大利总工会书记罗马尼奥利的发言
    新华社7日讯　意大利总工会书记罗马尼奥利7日在世界工联理事会议上发言。罗马尼奥利首先表示完全同意在报告中提出的为全面裁军、缓和局势及和平共处而斗争的总路线和目标。
    他说，我们认为有特别突出以下几点的必要：
    首先是国际局势的严重化。
    他认为，反动势力在各国进行反动进攻，现在更有可能采取和平共处措施
    帝国主义的政策，通过侵略和挑衅行动，暂时使最高级会议失败了。他们继续使世界处在战争的边缘，世界反动势力利用他们自己造成的巴黎会议的失败来恢复冷战，并在各国进行反动进攻，全世界都遭到巨大危险的威胁。
    他认为，应立刻肯定局势的严重性不应该导致我们对国际事件作出悲观的估计。正相反，现在比过去任何时刻更有可能在全世界采取胜利的行动，以便迫使最高级会议的召开，采取裁军、缓和局势、和平共处及和平的措施，这里已分析了力量的对比，我不想重复已说过的话。然而，还要强调指出，缓和局势的政策已取得很大的成功，这政策在世界范围内扩大了迫使帝国主义和反动势力接受和平共处的斗争，虽然最高级会议暂时失败，但帝国主义未能阻止这种进展。
    他说，我们没有任务从这个角度来研究社会主义国家在经济建设中巨大的发展，工人福利事业的发展，文化、科学以及社会主义民主的发展。然而，这些国家鼓舞人心的发展是和他们致力争取缓和局势与和平的政策分不开的。
    他说，这几天，我们亲身体会到伟大的中国人民的经验。
  我们更好地了解研究这个现实的必要性，因为这个现实对全世界工人和人民来说，是富有教育意义的教育。他认为，中国的经验是正确的，因为它来自于和平政策。
    他说，还应该考虑到在缓和局势，普遍裁军及和平共处的总的推动下，在全世界所发生过的和正在发生的事。
    我们认为帝国主义侵略势力，由于他们的政策遭到日益孤立的状态，大大地鼓舞了南朝鲜、土耳其、日本人民和南美的工人和人民的英勇斗争，也把古巴的革命引向伟大的胜利，它也鼓舞了和加速了非洲人民胜利地进行要求独立及取消殖民制度的斗争。即使在资本主义国家，缓和局势与和平共处政策也对工人阶级争取阶级的要求和发展在反对垄断资本、要求真正民主的斗争、社会和政治联盟的政策而进行的斗争和团结作出了并正在作出决定性的贡献。
    他认为，法国和意大利工人阶级的巨大的统一的斗争是为了工资要求和在两国的经济和政治结构范围内进行的。这就是为实现缓和局势的斗争给全世界工人们已经带来的结果，而帝国主义即使用挑衅和侵略行为，如导致首脑会议失败，也无法剥夺我们的这些成果。这些成就都是我们的，即使在今天还受到威胁，也都是属于我们的。那种可以把无产阶级和人民内部的新的、巨大的力量解放出来和结集起来以迫使帝国主义和反动派接受缓和国际局势、裁军与和平共处的政策依然是有效的。
    罗马尼奥利说，显然，在我们队伍里，特别在初期，有些人认为可以不通过斗争就能缓和国际局势，还有些人认为缓和局势政策是为了巩固现状的一种妥协。甚至有些工人也这样想，有些人认为苏联放弃军事优势和导弹是过于天真的表现，苏联的缓和国际局势政策是同帝国主义的一种妥协，资本主义国家工人将听凭老板的摆布。老板们拼命宣传这个错误思想。
    我们对类似的立场进行了斗争，因为这种立场是帮帝国主义和老板们的忙。共处和裁军政策是通过团结和斗争来实现的，而不是用放弃团结斗争来实现的。在所有的国家里，争取共处的斗争都有机地与无产阶级、劳动者和人民的民族目标联结在一起的，这些目标是：独立，经济和社会解放与发展，民主和自由。
    他说，我们认为，缓和局势政策的正确性还在于它的统一性和普遍性，事实上，这个政策不仅不向帝国主义作任何让步，而是孤立它和麻痹它。工人及其统一工会的任何别的政策，都有害于和平，孤立工人阶级，使它的分裂永久化，而符合帝国主义和反动派的利益。当我们说，帝国主义是软弱的，和平力量是占上风的，我们说的是一个具有极其鼓舞人心的事实。但是不要作出简单化的结论。由于社会主义国家工人阶级根本性和具有历史意义的成就，由于过去殖民主义者压迫下的民族取得的独立，由于殖民地国家人民的斗争，和资本主义国家工人阶级的行动，帝国主义受到了削弱。帝国主义是弱的，因为所有进步力量的政策把它约束住了。它还将削弱下去，我们今天可以确信它的历史前景就是灭亡。他这样认为，帝国主义并非到处都是一样的弱小，它还可以在世界上许多地方做坏事。不应该使工人阶级和劳动人民低估敌人的力量，因为过低估计敌人的力量，既会使工人阶级及其同盟者减弱他们的斗争，又会使他们作出冒险的决定和采取错误的措施。
    他说，因此，我们似乎应该从深刻的信念中吸取无限的信心和促使斗争获得新高涨的力量。这个信念就是：和缓、裁军和和平共处是正确的，它可以最大限度地在世界范围和国内动员工人阶级及工会组织的力量和民主力量。
    他说，在意大利，如同在其他资本主义国家一样，有巨大的可能性和必要性来开展工人阶级的斗争。反对帝国主义的斗争是同反对垄断阶级的资本主义的斗争不可分割地联在一起的。
    他认为，如果我们在争取和平斗争的问题上采取一种片面的解决办法或者仅只以进行宣传来引导这个斗争，我们就不能取得这个结果。斗争的扩大和加强可以各国的工人阶级在无产阶级国际主义精神指导下的所采取的独立自主的、本国的主动创议来保证。
    他说，在资本主义国家里，任务是困难的，然而，却是必需的，迫不急待的。
    帝国主义和意大利垄断资本势力主要沿着以下三个主要方向活动：
    他说，第一个主要是政治方向，它是要通过北大西洋公约，通过建立美国军队的军事和火箭基地把意大利拴住在国际帝国主义阵线上。这个严重的事实要求我们最大限度地反对军事和火箭基地，因为这些基地构成了对于我国，对于社会主义国家进行威胁的危险。
    意大利工人保证清除美国的侵略基地
    U—2型飞机事件证明了，目前，甚至就在意大利，还存在着供这种飞机起飞和演习用的基地。我们向苏联工会的同志们，并通过他们，向苏联全体工人表示，意大利总工会和意大利工人再一次庄严地保证，要清除在我国设立的一切挑衅和侵略的基地。
    他说，大垄断资本的老板们活动的第二个方向就是要用冻结工人工资和加剧社会不平衡的办法来阻止经济真正的发展。在我国，一方面，高度工业化了的企业在兴盛发展，而另一方面，更多的企业却停滞不前。
    他说，要求增加工资的斗争就成了牵制垄断资本活动的一个主要条件。鉴于我国出现的巨大差别和失调现象，我们就不能只限于要求提高所有工人微薄的工资。如果这样做的话，这就会有利于垄断资本的集中，有利于针对工人阶级和他们统一工会所采取的拉拢和歧视活动。我们不同意按产量计算工资。他认为，希望工会能够渗入劳资关系的各方面，能够重视由于各部门各企业中资本分门别类的组合造成的社会影响。这样的路线保证了我们工会有更大的力量，不仅表现在劳资关系方面，而且表现在经济要求方面。他说，我们赞成这些目标，赞成对国民经济实行人民民主监督的重大问题，改革经济结构特别是土改和广泛国有化的问题。裁军斗争不仅是在意大利要求把用于军备的款子用到生产性的目的上去，而且也是一个反对垄断资本政权的目前结构，争取实行经济和社会政策的新方针的斗争。
    他说，垄断资本的老板们所要遵循的反工人反民主方向是他们的第三个方向。这些老板们要在工厂内和在全国内享有完全的自由。我们一直在进行的斗争和我们将更努力进行的斗争，是反对资方一贯进攻工人的自由，反对他们进攻工会的权利，这个斗争是意大利人民争取真正民主的根本目标之一。
    他说，在从意大利阶级斗争的上面三个方向中，产生了意大利无产阶级和我们劳联所采取的自治和国家斗争一致的有机的行动路线。
    罗马尼奥利在谈关于殖民地和不发达国家以及它们同资本主义国家工人的关系问题时说，他同意扎卡里亚的报告。他说，意大利同广阔的非洲大陆隔海相望。阿尔及利亚和黑非洲人民的英勇斗争，是鼓舞人进行斗争的强有力的因素，这是一股使人清新的凉风。我们应当采取各种形式加强我们的关系和我们的团结，来支持殖民地人民和最近获得解放的人民，争取政治经济独立的斗争。因为这也是一个解放全人类的斗争。我们应当无条件地毫无保留地支持工会团结，和非洲，拉丁美洲大陆联盟自治的新高涨。工会团结和自治是“国际自由工联”激烈反对的两个目标，其目的在于维持帝国主义在非洲和拉丁美洲的统治。
    他说，资本主义国家的工会应加强同正在为独立而斗争的群众的团结。在工业高度发达的资本主义国家与不发达国家经济政治关系问题上，这些工会不应无动于衷或采取中立。他们应当和过去一样，但要有新的高涨，在他们的斗争中要求做到：同真正代表殖民地和前殖民地国家的力量建立经济和政治联系，不是同殖民主义势力及其经济政治代理人建立联系，而是同人民的真正代表建立联系。他们应当为在权利平等的基础上建立政治经济联系而斗争，以便消灭殖民主义的残余，揭露新资本主义的阴谋诡计，他认为这是合乎要求工业化、要求改造农业和整个社会的人民的意愿的。
    他在发言结束时说：为争取和平共处，争取和平而斗争的世界工人阶级和劳动者的团结万岁！
