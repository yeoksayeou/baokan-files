    Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary Romanioli delivered a speech at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the 7th. Romanioli first expressed his complete agreement with the general line and objectives of struggling for comprehensive disarmament, easing tensions, and peaceful coexistence as proposed in the report.
    He said, we believe it is particularly necessary to highlight the following points:
    First, the aggravation of the international situation.
    He believes that reactionary forces are carrying out reactionary offensives in various countries, and it is now more possible to take measures for peaceful coexistence.
    The imperialist policies, through acts of aggression and provocation, have temporarily caused the failure of the summit meeting. They continue to keep the world on the brink of war, and world reactionary forces are using the failure of the Paris meeting, which they themselves created, to restore the Cold War and carry out reactionary offensives in various countries. The whole world is threatened by enormous danger.
    He believes that the seriousness of the situation should not lead us to pessimistic estimates of international events. On the contrary, now more than at any time in the past, it is more possible to take victorious actions throughout the world in order to force the convening of a summit meeting and to take measures for disarmament, easing tensions, peaceful coexistence and peace. The balance of power has already been analyzed here, and I do not want to repeat what has already been said. However, it should also be emphasized that the policy of easing tensions has achieved great success. This policy has expanded the struggle to force imperialism and reactionary forces to accept peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Although the summit meeting has temporarily failed, imperialism has failed to stop this progress.
    He said, it is not our task to study from this perspective the tremendous development of socialist countries in economic construction, the development of worker welfare, culture, science, and socialist democracy. However, the inspiring development of these countries is inseparable from their dedication to the policy of striving for easing tensions and peace.
    He said, in these few days, we have personally experienced the experience of the great Chinese people.
  We better understand the necessity of studying this reality, because this reality is an educational experience for workers and people all over the world. He believes that China's experience is correct because it comes from a policy of peace.
    He said that it should also be considered what has happened and is happening all over the world under the general impetus of easing tensions, universal disarmament and peaceful coexistence.
    We believe that the imperialist aggressor forces, due to their policy of being increasingly isolated, have greatly encouraged the heroic struggles of the people and workers of South Korea, Turkey, Japan and South America, and have also led the Cuban revolution to a great victory. It has also encouraged and accelerated the African people's victorious struggle to demand independence and abolish the colonial system. Even in capitalist countries, the policies of easing tensions and peaceful coexistence have made and are making decisive contributions to the working class's struggle for class demands and development in the struggle against monopoly capital, demanding true democracy, and the policies of social and political alliances.
    He believes that the great united struggles of the French and Italian working classes are for wage demands and are carried out within the economic and political structures of the two countries. This is the result that the struggle to achieve easing tensions has already brought to workers all over the world, and even imperialism cannot deprive us of these achievements even with provocative and aggressive acts, such as leading to the failure of the summit conference. These achievements are all ours, and even if they are threatened today, they all belong to us. The kind of achievements that can liberate and unite the new and great forces within the proletariat and the people to force the imperialists and reactionaries to accept the policies of easing international tensions, disarmament and peaceful coexistence are still effective.
    Romanioli said that obviously, in our ranks, especially in the initial stage, some people believed that international tensions could be eased without struggle, and some people believed that the policy of easing tensions was a compromise to consolidate the status quo. Even some workers think so. Some people think that the Soviet Union's abandonment of military superiority and missiles is too naive, and that the Soviet Union's policy of easing international tensions is a compromise with imperialism, and that workers in capitalist countries will be left to the mercy of their bosses. The bosses are desperately spreading this wrong idea.
    We have struggled against similar positions because this position is helping the imperialists and bosses. The policies of coexistence and disarmament are achieved through solidarity and struggle, not through abandoning solidarity and struggle. In all countries, the struggle for coexistence is organically linked with the national goals of the proletariat, the working people, and the people: independence, economic and social liberation and development, democracy and freedom.
    He said that we believe that the correctness of the policy of easing tensions also lies in its unity and universality. In fact, this policy not only does not make any concessions to imperialism, but isolates and paralyzes it. Any other policy of the workers and their unified trade unions is harmful to peace, isolates the working class, and makes its division permanent, which is in the interests of imperialism and reactionaries. When we say that imperialism is weak and that the forces of peace are dominant, we are talking about an extremely encouraging fact. But don't draw simplistic conclusions. Imperialism has been weakened due to the fundamental and historically significant achievements of the working class in socialist countries, the independence achieved by the nations formerly oppressed by colonialism, the struggles of the people in colonial countries, and the actions of the working class in capitalist countries. Imperialism is weak because the policies of all progressive forces have constrained it. It will continue to weaken, and today we can be sure that its historical prospect is extinction. He believes that imperialism is not everywhere as weak, and it can still do bad things in many parts of the world. The working class and the working people should not underestimate the strength of the enemy, because underestimating the strength of the enemy will both weaken the struggle of the working class and its allies, and will make them make adventurous decisions and take wrong measures.
    He said that therefore, it seems that we should draw infinite confidence and the power to promote new upsurges in the struggle from a deep conviction. This belief is that: d√©tente, disarmament and peaceful coexistence are correct, and it can maximize the mobilization of the strength of the working class and trade union organizations and democratic forces in the world and at home.
    He said that in Italy, as in other capitalist countries, there are great possibilities and necessities to carry out the struggle of the working class. The struggle against imperialism is inextricably linked to the struggle against monopoly capitalism.
    He believes that if we adopt a one-sided solution to the issue of the struggle for peace or only guide this struggle by conducting propaganda, we cannot achieve this result. The expansion and strengthening of the struggle can be guaranteed by the independent and autonomous initiatives of the working class in various countries under the guidance of the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    He said that in capitalist countries, the task is difficult, but it is necessary and urgent.
    Imperialism and the Italian monopoly capital forces mainly operate in the following three main directions:
    He said that the first is mainly a political direction, which is to tie Italy to the international imperialist front through the North Atlantic Treaty and the establishment of military and rocket bases for the US military. This serious fact requires us to oppose military and rocket bases to the maximum extent, because these bases constitute a danger of threatening our country and socialist countries.
    Italian workers guarantee to eliminate US aggressive bases
    The U-2 aircraft incident proves that, even in Italy, there are still bases for this type of aircraft to take off and conduct exercises. We express to the comrades of the Soviet trade union, and through them, to all the workers of the Soviet Union, the solemn guarantee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Italian workers once again, that we will eliminate all provocative and aggressive bases set up in our country.
    He said that the second direction of the activities of the large monopoly capitalists is to prevent real economic development by freezing workers' wages and exacerbating social imbalances. In our country, on the one hand, highly industrialized enterprises are flourishing, while on the other hand, more enterprises are stagnating.
    He said that the struggle to demand wage increases has become a major condition for containing the activities of monopoly capital. In view of the enormous differences and imbalances in our country, we cannot limit ourselves to demanding higher meager wages for all workers. If we do so, it will benefit the concentration of monopoly capital and the activities of wooing and discriminating against the working class and their unified trade unions. We do not agree to calculate wages based on output. He believes that he hopes that trade unions can penetrate all aspects of labor-management relations and pay attention to the social impact caused by the compartmentalized combination of capital in various departments and enterprises. This kind of route guarantees that our trade union has greater strength, not only in terms of labor-management relations, but also in terms of economic demands. He said that we are in favor of these goals, in favor of the major issues of implementing people's democratic supervision of the national economy, and reforming the economic structure, especially land reform and extensive nationalization. The struggle for disarmament is not only demanding in Italy that the money used for armaments be used for productive purposes, but it is also a struggle against the current structure of the monopoly capital regime and striving for new guidelines for economic and social policies.
    He said that the anti-worker and anti-democratic direction that monopoly capitalists want to follow is their third direction. These bosses want to enjoy complete freedom in the factory and in the whole country. The struggle we have been waging and the struggle we will work harder to wage is against the capitalist's consistent attack on the freedom of workers and against their attack on the rights of trade unions. This struggle is one of the fundamental goals of the Italian people's struggle for true democracy.
    He said that in the above three directions of the Italian class struggle, an organic line of action consistent with the autonomous and national struggles of the Italian proletariat and our Labor Federation has emerged.
    When Romanioli talked about the issue of colonies and underdeveloped countries and their relationship with workers in capitalist countries, he said that he agreed with Zakaria's report. He said that Italy faces the vast African continent across the sea. The heroic struggles of the people of Algeria and Black Africa are a powerful factor in inspiring struggle, and this is a refreshing breeze. We should take various forms to strengthen our relations and our solidarity to support the struggle of the colonial people and the recently liberated people for political and economic independence. Because this is also a struggle to liberate all mankind. We should unconditionally and unreservedly support trade union unity and the new upsurge of autonomy in the African and Latin American continental alliances. Trade union unity and autonomy are two goals fiercely opposed by the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions", whose purpose is to maintain imperialist rule in Africa and Latin America.
    He said that trade unions in capitalist countries should strengthen their solidarity with the masses who are fighting for independence. These trade unions should not be indifferent or take a neutral attitude on the issue of economic and political relations between highly industrialized capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries. They should, as in the past, but with a new upsurge, demand in their struggles that: economic and political ties should be established with the forces that truly represent the colonial and former colonial countries, not with the colonialist forces and their economic and political agents, but with the true representatives of the people. They should struggle for the establishment of political and economic ties on the basis of equality of rights, so as to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and expose the conspiracies of neo-capitalism. He believes that this is in line with the wishes of the people who demand industrialization and demand the transformation of agriculture and the entire society.
    He said at the end of his speech: Long live the unity of the world working class and working people who are fighting for peaceful coexistence and for peace!
