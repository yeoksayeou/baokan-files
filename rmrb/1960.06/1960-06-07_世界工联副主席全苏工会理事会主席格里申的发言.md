Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Grishin, Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, emphasized at the 11th session of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions on the afternoon of the 5th that under the current situation, safeguarding and consolidating peace is the most important issue of concern to the people of all countries.

Grishin said that the people of all countries desire peace. However, it is not enough to merely hope. This hope should be confirmed by active actions. What is important now is to raise the vigilance of the people of all countries, expose the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressor forces, and strive to consolidate the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. He said that the Soviet Union and all socialist countries are unremittingly struggling to prevent a new war and to ease international tensions. He then spoke about the Soviet Union's consistent peace initiatives. He said that Soviet government head Khrushchev's visits to the United States, Southeast Asian countries, and France, with the mission of peace and friendship, had greatly promoted the strengthening of the cause of peace and facilitated the conditions for convening a high-level meeting.

Grishin pointed out that the consistent peace-loving policy of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries reflects the essence of the socialist system, in which power belongs to the working people who are deeply concerned about peace. The Soviet people are devoting all their strength to peaceful creative labor. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the Soviet people, the Soviet Union has transformed from a backward country into a powerful and highly developed socialist country. In 1959, the Soviet working people began to implement the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy, which fully unfolds the construction of communism. The implementation of the seven-year plan can take a decisive step in establishing the material and technical basis for communism, and it will further improve the living and cultural standards of the workers. The grand tasks of the seven-year plan have aroused unprecedented labor enthusiasm and initiative among the Soviet masses. The Soviet people have already achieved outstanding results in the implementation of the seven-year plan.

The socialist camp is increasingly consolidated, and it is a strong fortress of world peace.
He said that together with the Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China and all other countries of the socialist camp are moving forward to socialism and communism with full confidence. The indestructible family of the People's China and all socialist countries is a great spiritual and material force. It is a powerful obstacle on the road of imperialist conspiracies to push the people of all countries into the abyss of a new world war.

He said that all socialist countries are accelerating the speed of their economic development. Grishin believes that "in 1965, the socialist camp will produce more than half of the world's industrial products, which will create the preconditions for eliminating world wars from social life."

He said that the achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries have great international significance. This is a major assistance and support for the struggle of workers in capitalist countries against capitalist exploitation, against the attack of monopoly capital on democracy and trade union rights, and for the struggle for social progress and peace. This points out to the workers of the world a correct path to get rid of exploitation, disenfranchisement, unemployment, and poverty.

Grishin then emphasized that while the Soviet Union and all socialist countries are engaged in peaceful creative labor and are carrying out a resolute struggle to defend peace, a series of capitalist countries, and first of all the imperialist groups in the United States, are intensifying the arms race, inciting war frenzy, restoring the "cold war," and carrying out rampant anti-socialist and anti-Soviet propaganda. Open provocations are being carried out against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

He said that the improvement of the international situation is obviously not in the interests of the aggressive U.S. imperialists and militarists. While the Soviet Union was fighting for the convening of a summit meeting, the United States strengthened the arms race, vigorously prepared all kinds of "spy satellites" and submarines capable of launching missiles with nuclear weapons; American planes equipped with atomic and hydrogen bombs flew day and night in the sky, and the American armed forces and the military bases established by American imperialism around socialist countries were in combat readiness. The reactionary ruling clique of the United States, in order to undermine the Paris Four-Power Summit, carried out all kinds of sabotage activities before the meeting. Grishin then spoke about the provocative actions of the American military plane invading the Soviet border. He said that when the U.S. government was cornered by the confessions of the American spy pilots, it shamelessly declared that sending planes to Soviet airspace for espionage purposes was an established U.S. policy. This unprecedented act of undermining international law and Soviet sovereignty has been met with a due rebuff by the Soviet people and its government. The act of the U.S. ruling clique of breaking faith and undermining the summit meeting has been condemned by the people of the world.

Grishin said that the recent discussion of the U.S. spy plane's invasion of the Soviet Union by the United Nations Security Council, although the Security Council, under the manipulation of the United States, did not objectively analyze the case of the U.S. aggression, the result of the Security Council's discussion of this issue was a major victory for us. Regardless of the formal outcome of the vote, we exposed the aggressors in front of the world, denounced them in the face of world public opinion, and exposed the crimes of the American aggressors.

He said that the Soviet Union will unswervingly continue to fight against the enemies of peace and constantly expose the policies of the imperialist countries.

Grishin said that not long ago, the plenary session of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, in the name of our 55 million members, unanimously expressed support for and endorsement of the position taken by Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, in Paris. He emphasized, "This position, based on the Lenin principles of peaceful coexistence, equality, and respect for the sovereignty of all countries, is the only possible way to consolidate peace and the security of all countries."

Grishin continued, "As Khrushchev has pointed out more than once in his conversations, the Soviet Union will do everything possible to promote the relaxation of the international situation in the future. The Soviet Union now and in the future advocates peaceful coexistence and peaceful negotiations to strive for reasonable and mutually acceptable decisions." He believes that "if Western countries also work towards this end, and if they stop provoking socialist countries, then the international situation will normalize. In another six to eight months, our country will participate in the highest meeting in order to discuss and decide on mature international issues. If this is not possible, then our people will wait for another U.S. government that can show more reason and concern for the urgent demands of the people of all countries and the current international situation. We believe that it is also necessary to include the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries in future negotiations."

Grishin said that, as the facts show, the U.S. imperialist group has taken aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, attempting to sharpen international relations.

The American Eisenhower government played the shameful role of gendarme, playing the role of strangler of the freedom of the people of all countries. He tried every possible means to support the reactionary regimes that violated the will of the people and were supported by American bayonets - the Spanish dictator Franco, and the Chiang Kai-shek criminal group in Taiwan, which was driven out of the mainland by the great Chinese people. The U.S. government also supported the blatant reactionary - the so-called "founding father of Korea," the bloody executioner Syngman Rhee - with its bayonets. And he has been abandoned by the residents of South Korea. Eisenhower recognizes these and other stranglers of the people as his good friends. As people say, you can know what kind of person he is by looking at what kind of friends he has. The United States, for its own provocative purposes, places political zombies - Chiang Kai-shek elements - in the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The aggressive actions of the U.S. ruling group are a serious threat to world peace. The fact that the United States uses the territory of some countries as a base for U.S. spy flights actually turns these countries into accomplices in U.S. provocations. These actions of the United States undermine the foundation of normal relations between countries and increase the danger of military armed conflict and new wars.

Grishin believes that the international duty of the working people and trade unions of these countries is to fight by all possible means to eliminate U.S. military bases on foreign soil. The most important task of the trade union movement is to fully expose the bestial habits of the imperialist aggressors, especially the U.S. ruling group, to the working people, to explain to the working people, and to organize mass actions of the working people - marches and demonstrations, mass rallies and meetings to defend peace.

He said that the current international situation requires the working class and its trade union organizations and all working people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialists and to strengthen the struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace. Now all the propaganda machines - newspapers, radio, and television - have been launched in capitalist countries to deceive people, intimidate them, and distort the situation that has been formed. This propaganda clamors day and night, as if American militarism's aggression against the Soviet Union is not such a terrible thing. It shouts about the danger of communism, trying to deceive the people of all countries. Under these conditions, the task of trade unions is to do everything possible to strengthen counter-propaganda. Expose the imperialists and explain to the working people the full dangers of the imperialist adventurous policies.

Grishin also said that now, not only in the United States, but also in some other countries, the aggressive forces are intensifying their activities. West German militarists and their lackey Adenauer intend to put forward revanchist plans, and they are stepping up West Germany's rearmament; Japanese imperialists are using batons and terror to try to pass a new military treaty signed with the United States in the Diet, which betrays the interests of the Japanese people, and is primarily directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

With the realization of the disarmament plan, part of the funds released due to disarmament will be used to aid underdeveloped countries.

Grishin then spoke about the issue of disarmament. He believes that comprehensive disarmament should be given great importance. He said that all the actions of the U.S. government show that what it seeks is not disarmament, but "supervision of armaments." This supervision is nothing but espionage, and the U.S. government is doing everything possible to obstruct the solution of the issue of banning nuclear weapons tests, trying to provide itself with the possibility of conducting such weapons tests. The task of all peace advocates and trade unions is to expose this policy and conspiracy of the imperialists. Grishin also spoke about the new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government on June 2. He believes that with the implementation of the disarmament plan and the reduction of military expenditures in various countries, a portion of the funds released due to disarmament will be used to aid underdeveloped countries.

Grishin expressed his belief that the meeting of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions, like all upright people on the earth, will condemn the aggressive actions of the U.S. government, and call on all workers and trade unions to be vigilant and strengthen the struggle against U.S. aggressive provocations and to strive to eliminate U.S. military bases on their territories, and call on trade unions to demand that their governments support the just and open foreign policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and condemn the aggressive actions of the United States at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.

Grishin concluded by saying that there is no doubt that the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is at the forefront of all progressive forces in the international trade union movement, and all trade unions participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions, will achieve new achievements in the cause of uniting workers into a powerful, invincible front against imperialism and for world peace.

He emphasized that there is no doubt that the forces of peace will triumph over the forces of war.

    世界工联副主席全苏工会理事会主席格里申的发言
    据新华社6日讯　世界工联副主席、苏联全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申5日下午在世界工联第十一次理事会会议上强调，在当前形势下，维护和巩固和平是各国人民关心的最重要的问题。
    格里申说，各国人民都希望和平。但是，仅是希望是不够的。这种希望应该以积极的行动来确证。现在重要的是，提高各国人民的警惕性，揭露帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋，力求不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处原则得到巩固。他说，苏联和各社会主义国家为防止新战争、为和缓国际紧张局势，不懈地进行着斗争。他接着谈到苏联历来的和平倡议。他说，苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫对美国、东南亚各国和法国进行的以和平与友谊为使命的访问，在很大的程度上促进了和平事业的加强，便利了召开高级会议的条件。
    格里申指出，苏联和各社会主义国家的一贯爱好和平的政策，反应了社会主义制度的本质，在这种制度下，政权是属于深切关心和平的劳动人民的。苏联人民把自己的全部力量都用于和平的创造性劳动。由于苏联人民的英勇努力，苏联从过去落后的国家成了强大的、高度发达的社会主义国家。在1959年苏联劳动人民着手执行全面展开共产主义建设的发展国民经济七年计划。实现七年计划可以使苏联在建立共产主义的物质技术基础方面走出具有决定性的一步，它将更高地提高劳动者的生活和文化水平。七年计划的宏伟任务唤起了苏联群众的空前的劳动热情和积极性。苏联人民在执行七年计划中已取得杰出的成就。
    社会主义阵营日益巩固，它是世界和平的强大堡垒
    他说，同苏联在一起满怀信心的向社会主义和共产主义前进的，有伟大的中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他一切国家。社会主义阵营日益巩固，它是世界和平和各国人民之间的强大堡垒。人民中国和所有社会主义国家的不可摧毁的大家庭，是一个伟大的精神和物质力量。它是帝国主义阴谋把各国人民推向新的世界大战的深渊里去的道路上强大的障碍。
    他说，所有的社会主义国家，都在加快自己的经济发展的速度。格里申认为，“在1965年，社会主义阵营将生产全世界工业产品产量的一半以上，这就将为从社会生活中消除世界大战，建立先决条件。”
    他说，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的成就，拥有巨大的国际意义。这对于资本主义国家劳动者反对资本主义剥削，反对垄断资本进攻民主和工会权利的斗争以及对于争取社会进步和和平的斗争来说，是一个重大的援助和支持。这向全世界劳动者指出一条摆脱剥削、无权、失业和贫穷的正确的道路。
    格里申接着强调指出，在苏联和所有社会主义国家从事和平的创造性的劳动，进行坚决的保卫和平的斗争的时候，一系列的资本主义国家，而首先是美国的帝国主义集团正在加紧军备竞赛，煽起战争狂热，恢复“冷战”进行猖狂的反社会主义和反苏的宣传。对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行公开的挑衅。
    他说，国际局势的改善显然不符合侵略成性的美国帝国主义者和军国主义者的心意。当苏联正为争取召开首脑会议进行斗争的时候，美国却加强了军备竞赛，大力准备各种各样的“间谍卫星”以及携有核武器的能发射导弹的潜水艇；装有原子弹、氢弹的美国飞机昼夜不停的在天空飞行，美国的武装力量以及美帝国主义在社会主义国家周围建立的军事基地进行了战斗准备。美国反动统治集团，为了破坏巴黎四国首脑会议，在会议召开前进行了各种各样的破坏活动。格里申接着谈到美国军用飞机侵入苏联国境的挑衅行动。他说，当美国政府被美国间谍飞行员的供词逼得无路可走的时候，就厚颜无耻地声明，派飞机到苏联领空上进行以间谍为目的的飞行，是美国既定的国策。这种对国际法和苏联主权的史无前例的破坏行为，已经遭到苏联人民及其政府的应有的反击。美国统治集团背信弃义破坏首脑会议的行为，遭到全世界人民的谴责。
    格里申说，最近联合国安全理事会讨论美国间谍飞机侵略苏联事件，尽管安理会在美国操纵下，没有客观地分析美国侵略的案件，安全理事会对这个问题讨论的结果就是我们的重大胜利。不管表决的形式上的结果如何，我们在全世界面前揭露了侵略者，在世界舆论面前痛斥了他们，揭穿了美国侵略者的罪行。
    他说，苏联将坚持不懈地继续进行反对和平敌人的斗争，不断地揭露帝国主义国家的政策。
    格里申说，不久以前苏联工会中央理事会全会以我国五千五百万会员的名义，一致表示支持和拥护苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎所采取的立场。他这样强调，“这个建立在以和平共处、平等和尊重各国主权的列宁原则为基础的立场，是巩固和平和各国人民安全的唯一可能的道路。”
    格里申接着说，正如赫鲁晓夫在谈话中不止一次所指出的：苏联今后要尽一切可能来促进国际局势的缓和。苏联现在和将来都主张和平共处，和平谈判争取达成合理的、双方都能接受的决定。他认为，“如果西方国家也为此而努力，如果他们停止对社会主义国家的挑衅，那么国际局势就会正常化。再过六至八个月，我国将参加最高会见，以便讨论和决定成熟了的国际问题。如果不能这样，那么我国人民就等待一个能对各国人民的迫切要求和目前国际局势表现出较多的理智和关心的另一个美国政府，我们认为吸收中华人民共和国和亚洲其他国家参加未来的谈判也是必要的。”
    格里申说，正像事实所表明的那样，美帝国主义集团采取了反对苏联的侵略行动，力图使国际关系尖锐化。
    美国艾森豪威尔政府，扮演了可耻的宪兵角色，扮演了各国人民自由的扼杀者。他千方百计地支持那些违背人民意志靠美国刺刀支撑的反动政权——西班牙独裁者佛朗哥，被伟大的中国人民从大陆上赶出去的台湾的蒋介石罪恶集团。美国政府也用自己刺刀支持了露骨的反动分子——所谓“朝鲜国父”、血腥的刽子手李承晚。而他已经被南朝鲜的居民所抛弃。艾森豪威尔把这些和其他一些人民的扼杀者认作是自己的好的朋友。正如人们所说的，看他有什么样的朋友就可知道他是个什么样的人。美国为了自己的挑衅目的在联合国中华人民共和国的合法席位上安置着政治僵尸——蒋介石分子。
    美国统治集团的侵略行为是对世界和平的严重威胁。美国利用某些国家的领土作为美国间谍飞行的基地，这实际上把这些国家变成了美国挑衅的同谋者。美国这些行为破坏各国正常关系的基础，增加了军事武装冲突和新战争的危险。
    格里申认为，这些国家的劳动人民和工会的国际义务，就是用一切可能的方法来为消除美国在别国领土上的军事基地而斗争。工会运动最主要的任务就是全力向劳动人民揭露帝国主义侵略者，首先是美国的统治集团的野兽般的癖性、向劳动人民进行解释工作，和组织劳动人民的群众性的行动——保卫和平的游行示威、群众大会和集会。
    他说，当前的国际局势要求工人阶级及其工会组织和全体劳动人民对帝国主义者的阴谋保持高度的警惕性，加强维护和巩固和平的斗争。现在在资本主义国家中发动了全部的宣传机器——报纸、广播、电视来欺骗人们，恫吓他们，歪曲已形成的形势。这个宣传夜以继日地叫嚷，似乎美国黩武主义对苏联的侵略并不是这样可怕的事情。它叫喊共产主义的危险，企图欺骗各国人民。在这种条件下，工会的任务就是极力加强反宣传。揭露帝国主义者，向劳动人民说明帝国主义的冒险政策的全部的危害性。
    格里申又说，现在不仅是在美国，并且在其他一些国家内，侵略势力也在加紧活动。西德军国主义分子及其走卒阿登纳打算提出复仇主义计划，他们正在加紧西德的重新武装；日本帝国主义者利用警棍和恐怖手段企图在国会通过与美国签订的新的军事条约，这个条约出卖日本人民的利益，而且首先是反对苏联和中华人民共和国的。
    随着裁军计划的实现，由于裁军而腾出了的一部分资金将用于对不发达国家的援助
    格里申接着谈到裁军问题。他认为应当十分重视全面裁军。他说，美国政府的一切行为都说明，它所力求的并不是裁军，而是“对军备的监督”。这种监督并不是别的什么，而是间谍活动，美国政府千方百计的阻挠关于禁止试验核武器问题的解决，尽力为自己提供进行这种武器试验的可能性。一切和平拥护者和工会的任务，在于揭露帝国主义者的这种政策和阴谋。格里申还谈到苏联政府6月2日提出的全面彻底裁军的新建议。他认为，随着裁军计划的实现和各国军备开支的缩减，由于裁军而腾出了的资金的一部分将用于对不发达国家的援助。
    格里申表示，相信世界工联理事会的会议和地球上的一切正直人民一样，将谴责美国政府的侵略行为，并且号召所有劳动者和工会提高警惕，加强反对美国侵略挑衅和争取消除美国在他们领土上的军事基地的斗争，号召工会要求自己国家的政府支持苏联和其他社会主义国家的正义的正大光明的对外政策，并且在即将召开的联合国大会上谴责美国的侵略行为。
    格里申最后说，毫无疑问，在国际工会运动中走在所有的进步势力前面的世界工会联合会以及参加世界工联的所有工会，在把劳动者团结成强大的、不可战胜的、反对帝国主义的、争取世界和平的战线的事业中，将取得新的成就。
    他强调说，毫无疑问，和平力量将战胜战争力量。
