Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: The "Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" activities are entering a climax throughout the country. Propaganda teams composed of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people have been using various artistic forms in the streets of major cities and in some small and medium-sized cities, towns, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas in recent days to profoundly expose the aggressive nature and war policies of U.S. imperialism to the broad masses and to express the firm determination of the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan and resolutely defend world peace.

　　In Beijing, the Chinese People's Liberation Army system, the industrial system, and more than 40 art troupes from other places performing in Beijing are holding various forms of literary and artistic propaganda performances in the streets, factories, rural areas, schools, and military garrisons to expose the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and the cultural troupes of the Navy, Air Force, and Beijing Military Region have respectively performed at Tiananmen Square, the Working People's Cultural Palace, Tianqiao, Zhongshan Park, and the Beijing Young Pioneers Palace. Wherever they went, red flags fluttered, and anti-American anger surged. The General Political Department Cultural Troupe performed the magnificent "Anti-U.S. Imperialist Storm Chorus" and the political satire "Robber's Travel" at Tiananmen Square and the Working People's Cultural Palace. The famous Shandong Kuaishu storyteller Gao Yuanjun sang "Bombarding the Plague God," vividly exposing the mask of the number one war peddler, Eisenhower, to the great satisfaction of the audience. Cadets and soldiers' performance teams from the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Railway Corps directly subordinate units, and the Logistics Academy carried out enthusiastic performance activities in the suburbs and military garrisons. Military doctors, nurses, and convalescents from units such as the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army carried out propaganda in the canteens, department stores, wheat fields, and market towns of the suburban people's communes. Some combat heroes who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea went out with the propaganda team to tell the masses the truth about U.S. imperialism being a paper tiger. Teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music went to the streets for four consecutive days to perform new programs they had created, exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading our territory of Taiwan and undermining world peace. Many grassroots factories, mines, schools, and government agencies in the capital have also successively launched mass anti-American propaganda performances.

　　On the 26th, Shanghai dispatched a propaganda team and a literary and artistic army of 500,000 people to give lectures and performances of living newspapers, comic dialogues, and storytelling with anti-American struggle themes in public places such as streets, parks, and squares. Early in the morning at four or five o'clock, the first batch of propaganda teams came to the small vegetable markets to conduct propaganda to the cooks and women who were buying vegetables. Almost every major street in the city was a propaganda station, and the streets were filled with songs and slogans from morning to night. Hundreds of professional art troupes and famous actors Zhou Xinfang, Bai Yang, Zhang Ruifang, Yuan Xuefen, Ding Shi'e, Xu Yulan, and singer Cai Shaoxu all went to the streets to perform.

　　In the three towns of Wuhan, thousands of literary and artistic propaganda teams took to the streets from early morning on the 26th. The streets and alleys or parks and squares were crowded with people watching the propaganda performances.

　　Employees of the National Commune Power Supply Station performed the living newspaper drama "U.S. Imperialist Atrocity Pictures" on the streets. When the scene of the American aggressors killing our Taiwan compatriots was performed, the actors and the audience simultaneously erupted in a roar of "Fight!" in anger. In recent days, various factories, schools, and troops have held forums, reports, and lectures to expose the crimes of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

Many famous actors have performed programs they have written with the theme of anti-American struggle.

　　Literary and art workers in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing have performed many literary and art programs with the theme of anti-American struggle in recent days. Their slogan is: "Use songs as cannons, use pens as guns, and use literary and artistic weapons to peel off the mask of U.S. imperialism." The Frontline Drama Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has performed 20 shows in the streets, with more than 20,000 viewers. An art exhibition with the theme of anti-American struggle, organized by the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Artists Association and other units, opened on the 24th. The art exhibition displayed more than 290 art works, including cartoons, Chinese paintings, paper-cuts, and clay sculptures. These works have profound content and vivid forms, and are deeply welcomed by visitors.

　　Propaganda activities in Lanzhou are being carried out extensively and in depth. The Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe, the Gansu Provincial Opera Theatre, and the special county troupes that are holding a young actors' performance in Lanzhou have been taking newly compiled dramas to factories, communes, parks, streets, and alleys to carry out propaganda activities in recent days.

The propaganda team jointly organized by the Urumqi Qin Opera Troupe and the Quyi Society toured eight open-air squares in the city to perform street living newspaper dramas such as "Shameless Pioneer" and "Eisenhower's Shameful Failure." On the afternoon of the 23rd, while they were performing in the street, the weather suddenly changed dramatically, with wind and rain, but the actors and the audience were enthusiastic. The actors performed programs in the rain, and the masses watched in the rain. The thunder and rain were drowned out by the masses' contemptuous laughter and angry slogans against Eisenhower.

　　In Hohhot, on the 25th, more than 1,400 professional and amateur literary and art workers formed a mighty art performance team and took to the streets to carry out propaganda and performance activities. Members of the performance team of all ethnic groups held up banners and sang songs such as "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Song" and "Chinese People Must Liberate Taiwan" and conducted a demonstration parade on the main streets, and then performed at more than a dozen locations such as streets, squares, downtown areas, and stations.
