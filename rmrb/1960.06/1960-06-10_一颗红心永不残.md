A Red Heart Never Fades
Song Shihe, Political Teacher of the People's School, Shangshang Songjia Village Production Team, Gushidian Commune, Penglai County, Shandong Province

My name is Song Shihe, and I am the political teacher of the people's school in Shangshang Songjia Village Production Team, Gushidian Commune, Penglai County.

The Glorious Image of Pavel Inspired Me

In 1947, at the age of eighteen, I joined the People's Liberation Army, and the following year I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In June 1948, during the Battle of Yanzhou, I led a squad to carry out a blocking mission. In the battle, I suffered a severe head injury and remained unconscious for more than a hundred days. When I regained consciousness, three of my limbs were completely paralyzed, leaving only my left hand able to move. I thought, "My life is over, I can no longer work for the Party." But in my most depressed moments, I remembered what the instructor said at the Party membership oath ceremony: "Communist Party members are tough, and they must not bow their heads in the face of any difficulties." At this time, Secretary Han of the hospital also came to see me. He sat on the edge of the bed, held my hand, and said, "Revolution, how can it not involve bloodshed! Be strong, you can continue to work for the Party." Then he gave me the book "How the Steel Was Tempered." After reading the book, the glorious image of Pavel inspired me. I thought, "Pavel is completely paralyzed and blind, but he can still work for the Party. I have a pair of eyes and an arm, can't I continue to work for the Party?" Thinking of this, it increased my courage and determination to overcome difficulties. Therefore, I read while practicing writing with my left hand, often lying on the bed, holding a pen with my left hand to practice writing. But at first, my hand did not listen to commands at all. Not to mention writing, I couldn't even hold the pen properly, but I never wavered. I practiced writing on paper during the day and drawing on my belly and legs at night. After practicing for a month, I finally wrote a word. At this time, I wrote the following passage in my diary: "The enemy can cripple my body, but they cannot destroy this beating heart of mine. Although I can no longer carry a gun or do physical labor, I will use this active hand, my mouth, two ears, and eyes to continue working for the Party." When Secretary Han of the hospital heard that I could write, he happily came to see me and said with a smile: "The disease is most afraid of people with strong will. The stronger your will, the faster it will escape. Now you have won, but it is only the beginning, and you must continue to work hard to fight against difficulties." Secretary Han's words gave me great encouragement and education. Since then, I have become more active in learning. I read book after book, and wrote diary day after day. My actions moved the doctors and nurses, and the hospital Party branch also rated me as a model patient.

A Communist Party Member Must Not Forget the Revolution for a Moment

I stayed in the hospital for sixteen consecutive months, and these sixteen months were like years to me. During my hospitalization, I wrote application after application, requesting to be discharged from the hospital so that I could do some work for the Party. In the winter of 1949, after my repeated applications and requests, the hospital finally approved my return to my hometown. On the way home, I kept thinking, "What kind of work can I do after returning home? Will my mother be sad when she sees me?" When I returned home and saw my mother, she cried without saying a word. I held my mother's hand and said, "You should be happy. I came back without losing anything. What is there to fear if my body is paralyzed? I have a mouth to speak, eyes to see, and a hand to write. Can't I still work for the Party?" After hearing what I said, my mother wiped away the tears on her face and said nothing more. On the day I returned home, I handed over my Party membership transfer letter to Comrade Song Enquan, the village Party branch secretary. I also enclosed an application in the letter, requesting that work be assigned to me immediately. When Secretary Song saw that I was completely paralyzed and couldn't even sit up, he comforted me and said, "Comrade, don't rush to work. Your task is to recuperate. After your body recovers, we will give you work." After hearing his words, I hurriedly held the secretary's hand and said excitedly, "I have been recuperating for a long time, why are you still asking me to recuperate? I must work." However, the secretary still did not agree to my request. I thought carefully that the secretary did not assign me work because my body could not move. As long as I can move, I'm not afraid of not being given work to do. Therefore, I was determined to practice turning over and sitting up. The first step was to practice turning over, using my left hand to hold my leg and slowly move my body from left to right, and then from right to left. After practicing like this for a few days, I began to be able to turn over by myself. The second step was to practice sitting up. This made me feel a lot of difficulty. The whole body was like a heavy sandbag, and no matter how hard I tried to support myself with my left hand, I couldn't sit up. I gritted my teeth, endured the pain, and practiced again and again. Beads of sweat rolled straight down from my head. Once, I broke the edge of the kang, and I also slipped to the ground, but I still endured the pain and lay on the ground to practice. After practicing hard like this for more than a month, I was finally able to sit up. When I first sat up by supporting myself on the kang, I was so happy that I shouted loudly: "Mom, I can sit up!" And I immediately asked my mother to tell the village Party secretary this news and quickly assign me work to do. But the Party still did not allow me to work. Of course, I also knew that this was the Party's concern and love for me. But because of this, it made me feel even more uneasy, and my desire for work became even more urgent. Therefore, I worked hard to study. What to study? I thought the most important thing was Chairman Mao's books, so I found an old edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to study, and I also read newspapers frequently. Because I had only attended elementary school, my cultural level was low, and I couldn't understand many things, so I bought a dictionary. If there were unfamiliar characters, I looked them up in the dictionary. If I didn't know phonetic symbols, I asked high school graduates in the village for advice. I wrote the words and phrases I learned on small pieces of paper and pasted them on the wall and in the mosquito net, reading them and reciting them at any time. Young people in the village saw that my house had books and newspapers, and they all ran to read them. Taking this opportunity, I told them some revolutionary stories from battles and novels to conduct class education. In this way, I attracted a large group of people around me, including young people, old people, and children. Everyone was willing to listen to me tell stories and explain the truth, and they called me the "key to happiness." I was indescribably happy at this time, and I thought: Isn't this doing propaganda work for the Party? Because I could do some work for the Party, I was so happy that I didn't fall asleep for several nights in a row. Later, more and more people came to my house, and the house could not accommodate them. An old man named Song Zhao'en, who loved to read newspapers and listen to stories, suggested: "Child, let's start a people's school, and you can tell us a story every night." "Good!" The whole family responded in unison. I said, "That's great! That's great! I will definitely tell everyone well." I reported this idea to the Party branch secretary, who said: "It is very suitable for you to do this work, do it well, and come to me if you have any difficulties." From then on, I became a teacher at the people's school.

A Heart Forged of Iron

The people's school opened, and the young men in the village carried me to give lectures. More than forty people came on the first day. I told everyone about the current situation and the importance of learning. After the lecture, I led everyone to sing songs. Everyone was in high spirits, and the young people competed to carry me, which deeply moved me and made me feel even more energetic. But when I went back to bed at night and thought about it, I felt that this was not enough to have exhausted all my strength. Therefore, I was determined to go further and preach in the streets. The next day, as soon as it dawned, I asked my brother to carry me to the street, holding a megaphone in my hand to tell the masses about the "Current Situation and Our Tasks" written by Chairman Mao. The branch secretary saw me sitting on the ground doing propaganda work, sweating profusely, and said to me: "You are talking very well, but you can't stand it if you do this. In the future, don't come out. You can write propaganda materials at home and let those young people help you speak." From then on, I sat on the kang day and night writing propaganda materials; at the same time, I formed all the young people in the village into four propaganda groups and carried out propaganda every day through them. During the "Resist America, Aid Korea" campaign in 1950, some people thought it was "interfering in other people's affairs." I compiled propaganda materials on "Fighting Wolves Outside the Home" and "When the Lips are Gone, the Teeth are Cold," which solved the masses' confused thoughts and improved their understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea. The Party was very satisfied with my work and listed propaganda and people's school work as an important agenda item for the branch work, and absorbed me as a branch committee member. The Party's trust in me gave me great encouragement and made me feel that my responsibility was even greater. I wanted to better complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party, and I had to study hard, otherwise I would not be able to educate others. Therefore, I subscribed to eight kinds of newspapers and periodicals with my disability subsidy, read Chairman Mao's works every day, and read newspapers and magazines every day. I also posted two slogans on the wall, one was "Communist Party members must not give up the revolution for a moment," and the other was "Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works are treasures, and work can never be done well without studying them." I used these two sentences every day to encourage and spur myself to study hard and continue to move forward. In order to give good lectures and do a good job in propaganda, I often worked until late at night and often forgot to eat. My mother kept nagging me to pay attention to my body. Whenever my mother nagged me, I jokingly said: "Mom, my heart is forged of iron, as long as my heart doesn't go wrong, it doesn't matter how tired my body is." My mother smiled when I said this.

In the winter of 1953, the number of people in the people's school suddenly decreased, and I felt very uneasy. At this time, I asked my brother to carry me to visit the members' homes door to door. One day in the evening, I had just finished visiting and returned home when it suddenly snowed heavily and the northwest wind started blowing. The road was covered with snow. In order not to affect everyone's learning, I still asked my brother to carry me to the people's school. My brother carried me not far before he slipped and fell to the ground, falling into a small ditch. At this time, my brother got up and helped me up and said: "Shihe, let's go back! We can't go in such a strong wind and snow." I patted the snow off my body and said: "Brother, we can't go back. The more this kind of weather, the more the people's school needs me. Our work should persevere to the end and not be blocked by strong winds and heavy snow." Just as we were about to leave, the young men Song Legui and Song Shida, who had agreed to carry me, ran over in the heavy snow. When they saw that my brother and I were covered in snow, they complained that they were late. Then they carried me to the people's school. When the students saw that I had come in such weather, they were very moved. When they found a patch of blood on my left hand, they shouted. I said with a smile: "What's a little scratch, it's nothing." As I said that, I started the lecture. After the lecture, everyone said: "Song Shihe only has one arm, and he is not afraid of strong winds and heavy snow, and he can insist on coming to teach; we must study hard." In this way, the number of students increased day by day, and the enthusiasm for learning also greatly increased.

The Origin of the "Iron People's School"

In the autumn of 1958, Chairman Mao called on us to run people's communes in a big way. After hearing this news, I was extremely happy, and my disabled body seemed to have wings, and my enthusiasm was even greater. On the night our village established the people's commune, I participated in the torch parade in the tricycle issued by the government. I walked at the front of the team, leading the slogans, and my throat was hoarse, but I still kept shouting. After returning home, I rushed to write materials to promote the goodness of the commune overnight, and I wrote until the rooster crowed. At dawn, I gathered the young men of the propaganda team and replaced all the blackboards in the village with new content praising the people's commune. Not long after the commune was established, I went to the branch secretary to discuss how the people's school could adapt to the needs of the new situation. I suggested that the people's school go to the fields, and learning should follow production. The branch secretary agreed to my suggestion. Then I studied the learning methods with the students. The next day, I took my luggage and shook my tricycle to the field. Based on the production situation I learned, I compiled materials to praise good people and good deeds in production. As soon as the members rested, I seized the opportunity to give lectures and engage in propaganda and mobilization. One day at noon, it was very hot. I was lying on the ground writing propaganda materials and preparing lessons, and sweat was streaming down my face. Suddenly, I felt a shade on my head. When I turned my head, I saw that it was the branch secretary holding clothes and building a shed for me with branches. I said moved: "You go quickly, I'm doing very well here!" The branch secretary said humorously: "You are doing very well, but you will be melted in a while. If you are melted, we will have no one to teach." Then he grabbed the megaphone on the ground and shouted at everyone: "Comrades, we must learn from Song Shihe, and use his selfless spirit to fight the autumn harvest." The voice of Secretary Song aroused the labor enthusiasm of Manbo members and also encouraged my enthusiasm to do a good job, which made me feel the Party's warmth and encouragement. In the evening, I lived in the shack with the members. When I heard the sweet snoring of the young men beside me, I felt indescribably happy. I felt that this was the greatest happiness, and this happiness was being able to live with the members. Although I couldn't dance the hoe and work with them, our sweat could flow together.

The people's school was going to change textbooks. I didn't want a labor force to leave the fields during the tense production period, so I quietly shook my tricycle to the Gushidian bookstore to buy books. This village is six miles away from our village, and the road is winding and twisting. It is very difficult to shake the tricycle with one hand. I was so tired that my back was sore and my arms were painful. I walked from morning until noon. When I came back with the books, the strength in my arms was exhausted, so I had to stop the car on a small slope on the road and wait for passers-by to help me push it. It wasn't until the sun went down that I met someone who pushed me back. Although I was a little tired, I completed the task and saved a labor force, so I was very happy. After our village established a public canteen, I felt that the canteen was a very good place to study. Therefore, after the branch research decided to use the canteen as a classroom, the blackboard was hung on the wall of the canteen, and everyone was led to study once after each meal. Sometimes you can also learn to sing and engage in cultural activities. After I did this, the students were very satisfied, and their learning enthusiasm was also extremely high. Therefore, our people's school became more and more prosperous. Not only did we carry out literacy campaigns, but we also established high school classes and junior high school classes. In the winter of 1959, the whole province held a mass literacy and spare-time education examination. Not only did our entire village completely eliminate illiteracy, but many people also attended high school, and thirty-two people entered spare-time junior high school. Our Shangshang Songjia Village has become a cultural village. The commune party committee also specially awarded our village the honorary title of "Iron People's School."

What power prompted me to wage a tenacious struggle against the disease in the case of paralysis of three limbs? What power prompted me to do more work for the revolutionary cause? It is our dear Party, it is the great leader Chairman Mao. The Party saved me, and the Party cultivated and educated me. I feel that as long as there is a breath, I should do more work for the Party; as long as I can contribute more to the great socialist construction cause, I feel that it is the greatest happiness. I will guarantee to read more of Chairman Mao's books in the future, listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely follow Chairman Mao, and in the great situation of the continuous great leap forward in the 1960s, I will always be with the broad masses and make more and greater achievements for our great socialist-communist cause.

    一颗红心永不残
    山东省蓬莱县崮寺店公社山上宋家村生产队民校政治教师　宋士和
    我叫宋士和，是蓬莱县崮寺店公社山上宋家村生产队的民校政治教师
    保尔的光辉形象鼓舞着我
    1947年，我十八岁时，就参加了人民解放军，第二年光荣地参加了中国共产党。1948年6月，在兖州战役，我带领一个班担任阻击任务。在战斗中，头部受了重伤，一直昏迷了一百多天，当苏醒过来后，我的三肢已经完全瘫痪了，只剩下一只左手还能活动。我想，“这一辈子算完了，不能再为党工作了。”可是在我最苦闷的时候，想起了在入党宣誓会上，部队指导员讲的话：“共产党员是硬骨头，在任何困难面前都不能低头。”这时医院韩书记也来看我，他坐在床头上握着我的手说：“革命嘛，还能不流血！坚强起来，你还能继续为党工作。”接着他又送了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一书给我看。看了书后，保尔的光辉形象鼓舞着我。我想：“保尔全身瘫痪，双目失明，还能为党工作，我有一双眼睛和一支胳臂，就不能继续为党工作吗？”想到这里，就增加了我克服困难的勇气和决心。因此，便一边读书，一边用左手练习写字，经常伏卧在床上，左手握着笔练着写。可是一开始，手一点也不听指挥，别说写字，连笔也握不好，但我决不动摇，白天在纸上练着写，晚上在肚皮上和腿上划。练来练去练了一个月，终于写出字来了。这时我便在日记本上写了这样一段话：“敌人能打残废了我的身体，却打不坏我这颗跳动的心，尽管我再不能扛枪，再不能做体力劳动，但我要用这只能活动的手，用我的一张嘴，两个耳朵和眼睛，继续为党工作。”医院韩书记听说我能写字了，也高兴地来看我，笑着对我说：“病魔最怕有坚强意志的人，你的意志越坚强，它就逃得越快，现在你已胜利了，不过还只是开始，还要继续努力向困难作斗争。”韩书记的话，给了我以很大的鼓舞和教育。从此我便更加积极地学习起来。书，一册跟一册地读着，日记，一天接一天地写着。我的这些行动，感动了医生和护士，医院党支部还把我评为模范病员。
    共产党员一时一刻不能忘掉革命
    我在医院里一连住了十六个月，这十六个月对我来说，真是度日如年。在住院的过程中，我曾接二连三的写申请书，要求出院，好为党作点工作。1949年冬，经过我再三申请与要求，医院终于批准我回到我自己的家乡。在回家的路上，我一直在想：“回乡后能作些什么工作，妈妈看见了不难过吗？”当我回到家中见到母亲后，她老人家什么话也没说就哭了起来。我握住妈妈的手说：“你应该高兴啊，我身上什么也没少就回来了，身子瘫了怕什么，我有嘴能说，有眼能看，有一只手能写，还不是一样可以为党工作吗？”妈妈听了我这番话后，只好抹去了脸上的泪水，不再说什么了。我回家当天就把党的关系信交给了村支部书记宋恩全同志，在关系信里我还夹了一份申请书，要求立即分配工作给我作。宋书记看见我完全瘫痪了，连坐都坐不起来，就安慰我说：“同志，别忙工作，你的任务就是休养，等身子好了后，再给你工作。”我听了他的话，急忙握着支书的手，激动地说：“我已经休养了好长时间，怎么还叫我休养？我一定要工作。”可是，支书还是不答应我的要求。我仔细想，支书不分配我工作，准是因为我的身子不能活动。我只要能活动，不怕不给工作干。因此我就下定决心练习翻身和坐起。第一步，先练习翻身，用左手拿着腿，慢慢地使身子从左边翻到右边；再从右边翻到左边。这样练习了几天，才开始能自己翻身。第二步又练习坐起。这使我感到了很大困难，整个身体像一只沉重的砂袋，用一只左手怎么支撑也坐不起来，我咬紧牙，忍着痛，一次跟一次练着，豆大的汗珠从头上直滚下来。有一次把“炕缘木”碰坏了，我也滑到地下，但我还是忍着痛躺在地下练。就这样苦苦练了一个多月，终于能坐了起来。当我第一次扶着炕坐起来时，高兴得大声招呼起来：“妈妈，我能坐起来了！”并且马上叫妈妈把这个消息告诉党支书，赶快分配工作给我作。可是党还是不让我工作。当然，我也知道这是党对我的关怀与爱护。但是正因为如此，就使我心情更加不安，要求工作的心情更加迫切，因此我便努力学习起来。学什么呢，我想最重要的是毛主席的书，就找了一本旧版“毛泽东选集”来学，同时经常看报纸。因为我只上过初小，文化水平低，很多地方看不懂，就买了字典，有生字就查字典，不会注音字母就向村里高小毕业生请教。我把所学习的字和词写成一张张小纸条，贴在墙上，贴在蚊帐里，随时看，随时读。村里的青年人看到我家有书报，都跑来看书读报。趁这个机会，我就给他们讲些战斗中和小说中的革命故事，进行阶级教育。这样，就吸引了一大帮人在我身边，有青年，有老人，也有小孩。大家都愿听我讲故事，说道理，并且叫我是“开心的钥匙”。我这时有说不出的高兴，心里想：这不是在为党作宣传工作吗？因为我能为党作点工作，高兴的我一连好几个夜里都没有睡着觉。以后到我家来的人越来越多，房子容纳不了，一位爱看报听故事的宋兆恩老大爷，提议说：“孩子，咱们办个民校吧，你每天晚上给俺说上一段。”“好！”全屋老少齐声响应起来。我说：“太好了！太好了！我一定好好给大家讲。”我把这个意见报告了党支书，支书说：“你作这个工作很合适，好好干吧，有什么困难就找我。”从此我就成了民校的教师。
    一颗铁铸的心
    民校开学了，村中青年小伙子，背着我去讲课，第一天到了四十多人，我和大家讲了当前的形势和学习的重要性。讲完课，我就领大家唱起歌来，大家情绪很高，年轻人都争着来背我，使我深受感动，觉得自己更有劲了。但晚上回去躺在床上想想，觉得光是这样还不能算是尽了所有力量。因此就下决心进一步到街上去宣传。第二天天一蒙亮，我就叫我哥哥把我背到街上去，手里拿着广播筒向群众讲毛主席所写的“目前形势和我们的任务”。支书看到我坐在地上作宣传工作，累的满头大汗，对我说：“讲的很好，不过这样干身子吃不消，今后你不要出来，可在家写宣传材料，叫那些小伙子帮你讲。”从此，我就白天黑夜坐在炕上写宣传材料；同时把全村青年组成四个宣传组，通过他们天天进行宣传。1950年“抗美援朝”时，有的人认为是“多管闲事”。我就编了“家外打狼”与“唇亡齿寒”的宣传材料，解决了群众的糊涂思想，提高了对抗美援朝的认识。党对我的工作很满意，把宣传与民校工作列为支部工作的重要议程，并吸收我为支部委员。党对我的信任，给了我极大的鼓舞，使我感到自己的责任更加重大了，我想要更好的完成党所交给的任务，自己非好好学习不可，自己提不高，没法去向别人进行教育。因此我就用残废金订了八种报刊，天天读毛主席著作，天天看报刊杂志。还在墙壁上贴了两张标语，一张是“共产党员一时一刻也不能放掉革命”，另一张是“马列主义毛泽东著作是宝，不学习它工作永远作不好。”我天天都用这两句话，来勉励、鞭策自己发奋读书，不断前进。为了讲好课和作好宣传工作，我往往工作到深夜，常常忘了吃饭，妈妈成天念叨我要注意身子，每当妈妈念叨我的时候，我就打趣的说：“妈妈，我的心是铁铸的，只要心不出毛病，身子股怎么累也没事。”我这样一说妈妈也笑了。
    1953年的冬天，民校人数突然减少，我心里很不安，这时就叫我哥哥背着我挨门挨户到社员家去访问。有一天傍晚，我刚访问回家，天突然下了大雪，还刮起了西北风，道路被雪盖住了，为了不影响大家的学习，我仍叫哥哥背我去上民校。我哥哥背着我走了不远，就滑倒在地，跌在小沟里。这时我哥哥爬起来扶着我说：“士和啊，回去吧！这样大风大雪的走不去。”我拍了拍身上的雪说：“哥哥，不能回去，越是这样天气，民校越需要我去。我们的工作应该坚持到底，不受大风大雪阻拦。”刚要走，原先约好来背我的小伙子宋乐贵与宋士达踏着大雪跑来了。他们一看我与哥哥满身是雪，都埋怨自己来晚了。他们接着把我背到了民校，学员们一看这样天气我都来了，都很受感动。当他们发现我左手上有一片血，就喊起来，我笑着说：“挂了点小花算啥，没有事。”说着我就讲起课来。散课后，大家都说：“人家宋士和只有一只胳臂，不怕大风大雪，能坚持来教；我们一定要好好学。”这样一来，学生人数就一天天多了起来，学习积极性也大大提高了。
    “铁民校”的由来
    1958年秋天，毛主席号召我们大办人民公社，听到这个消息后，我心里高兴极了，残废的身子好像添了翅膀，干劲更大了。我们村成立人民公社的晚上，我坐着政府发给我的三轮车，参加了灯火游行，我走在队伍的最前边，领着呼口号，喉咙喊哑了，我还是不停的喊。回家后，我连夜赶写宣传公社好的材料，一直写到鸡叫，天一亮就召集宣传组的小伙子，把全村黑板报都换上了歌颂人民公社的新内容。公社成立不久，我去找支部书记，商议民校怎么适应新形势发展的需要，我提议民校到田，学习跟着生产转。支书同意了我这个意见。接着我就与学员研究了学习方法。第二天，我就带着行李，摇着三轮车到田里。我根据了解到的生产情况，编写表扬生产中好人好事的材料，社员一休息，我就抓空讲课，搞宣传鼓动工作。有一天的中午天很热，我正伏在地上写宣传材料和备课，汗水一把把流下来，忽然我感到头上荫凉了，扭头一看，原来是支部书记拿着衣裳用树枝给我搭了一个凉棚。我感动地说：“你快去吧，我在这好得很呵！”支书幽默地说：“好得很，呆一会就把你晒化了。晒化了我们就没有人教了。”接着他就抓起地下的广播筒，朝着大家喊起来：“同志们，咱们要向宋士和学习，以他的忘我精神来大战秋收。”宋支书的声音，鼓起了满泊社员的劳动热情，也鼓舞了我搞好工作的积极性，使我感到党对我的温暖与鼓励。晚上我与社员一起住在窝棚里，当听着身旁小伙子们香甜的呼噜声，心里有说不出的愉快。我觉得这就是最大的幸福，这幸福就是能和社员生活在一起，虽然我不能舞着镢头和他们一起劳动，但汗水却能流在一起。
    民校要换课本了。我不愿意在生产紧张的时候，让一个劳动力离开田野，自己便悄悄地摇着三轮车到崮寺店书店买书。这村隔我们村六里路，而且道路弯弯曲曲，一只手摇着三轮车很费劲，累得我腰酸臂痛，从早晨起一直到天晌才走到。买书回来时，手臂的劲使尽了，不得不在路上一个小坡停住车，等着过路人帮我推，直到太阳落了山才碰上人把我推了回来。我虽然受了点累，但却完成了任务，节省了一个劳动力，心中很高兴。我村成立公共食堂后，我感到餐厅是个很好的学习场所。因此，经支部研究决定以餐厅当课堂，把黑板挂在餐厅墙上，每顿饭后都领着大家学习一回。有时还可以学学唱歌，搞搞文娱活动。我这样做了后，学员们都很满意，学习情绪也高极了。因此我们的民校也就越办越兴旺了，不单搞扫盲，还成立了高小班，初中班。1959年冬天，全省举行扫盲与业余教育大会考，我们全村不仅全部扫除了文盲，而且还有不少人上了高小，有三十二人进了业余初中。我们这个山上宋家村已经成为一个文化村了。公社党委还特别授予我们这村一个“铁民校”的光荣称号。
    是什么力量促使我在三肢瘫痪的情况下，向病魔作顽强的斗争呢？是什么力量促使我要为革命事业多作点工作呢？是我们亲爱的党，是伟大领袖毛主席。党救活了我，党培养教育了我，我觉得只要还有一口气，就应该为党多作一点工作；只要能为伟大的社会主义建设事业多出一点力，就感到是莫大的幸福。我今后保证还要多读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决跟毛主席走，在六十年代持续大跃进的大好形势下，永远和广大群众在一起，为着我们伟大的社会主义—共产主义事业做出更多更大成绩。（附图片）
