    Husband and Wife Engage in Innovation
    Xue Shuling and Guo Ruizong, husband and wife, are both advanced producers in our factory. These days, the young couple not only engage in innovation at the factory during work hours, but also talk about it incessantly when they return home in the evening.
    A few days ago, the girls in the punch press group were arguing endlessly around a punch press. They were trying to figure out how to automate the bending of clips! For this matter, they had been working day and night for more than ten days, failing hundreds of times. The automatic bending jig and fixture had not been successful. What to do? Who to ask for help? Suddenly, Xue Shuling thought: find Guo Ruizong! Guo Ruizong is a fourth-grade fitter in Workshop 46, a top-notch young man. Everyone was overjoyed at the suggestion. But then she thought again: Workshop 46 is also engaged in innovation, how could he spare the time to help us!
    With a try-it-and-see attitude, Xue Shuling told Guo Ruizong about this matter. Who knew that when Guo Ruizong heard that they wanted him to help, he immediately expressed that no matter what it was, as long as it was within his ability, he would be there whenever called upon and do his best to help. After that, he worked in Workshop 46 during the day and engaged in innovation with the workers of Workshop 35 at night. The young couple would also discuss it for half the night when they returned to the dormitory. After repeated deliberation and experimentation, the ideal of automatic clip bending was finally realized, and production efficiency immediately increased tenfold.

    夫妻闹革新
    薛树玲和郭瑞宗夫妻俩都是我们厂的先进生产者。这些日子，小两口不光是上班的时候在厂里闹革新，晚上回到家里，还是絮絮不休地谈论着。
    前些日子，冲床小组的姑娘们，围着一台冲床吵个不休。她们正在琢磨卡子打弯自动化哩！为了这件事，她们已经折腾了十几个昼夜，失败了上百次，自动打弯的工夹具始终没有成功。怎么办？向谁求援？忽然，薛树玲想起来了：找郭瑞宗去！郭瑞宗是四十六车间的四级钳工，顶呱呱的小伙子。这一说，大伙一时乐得合不拢嘴。可是她又转念一想：四十六车间也在闹革新，哪能抽出时间来帮助咱们！
    薛树玲抱着试试看的心理，把这件事告诉了郭瑞宗。谁知郭瑞宗听说要找他帮忙，立即表示，无论什么事，只要他能力所及，随叫随到，尽力帮忙。此后，他白天在四十六车间干活，夜晚就和三十五车间的工人一起闹革新。小两口回到宿舍里还要讨论个半天。经过反复琢磨、试验，卡子自动打弯的理想终于实现了，生产效率一下子就提高了十倍。
