    A Great Harvest in a Year of Severe Drought
    In our Malou People's Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, from the time we started planting wheat last year until the wheat was heading and filling, we didn't have a single thorough rain for more than two hundred days. This was a drought the likes of which hadn't been seen in many years, and in the old society, it would have become a major famine year. However, today, with the realization of the people's commune, not only did it not become a disaster, but on the contrary, the commune's wheat planting area expanded by more than 9,000 mu compared to last year, and a great harvest was achieved in a year of severe drought.
    Our commune's more than 49,000 mu of wheat, whether in the mountains, plains, or hills and depressions, if you came here before the harvest, you would see waves of wheat everywhere, a scene of abundance. Generally, the wheat stalks were three to four feet tall, and each ear was three to four inches long, with about fifty to sixty grains per ear, each grain plump. The fields of the Huying Brigade, which the masses used to call "Wild Grass Lake," also achieved a great harvest of wheat this year. The commune members sang, "The People's Commune is like the sun, shining and transforming Huying, the Peng River reverses its flow for water conservation, and good crops grow in Wild Grass Lake." When the Wangzhuang Brigade harvested wheat in previous years, the amount of wheat cut was not enough to haul; this year, all twenty-seven oxcarts of the entire brigade were mobilized, working day and night without stopping. Wheat stalks were spread all over the ground, and wheat stacks piled up like mountains. The fields and warehouses originally built and prepared by the brigades now feel inadequate.
    This year is not only a great wheat harvest, but also a harvest of wheat, barley, peas, and broad beans. Some production teams have increased production several times over. The commune's already threshed 3,846 mu of wheat has an average yield of 244 jin per mu, an increase of 19% compared to last year; the already threshed 905 mu of barley has an average yield of 252 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared to last year. The Malou high-yield demonstration plot, which has always had high yields, has achieved even higher yields; the already threshed 312 mu of wheat has an average yield of 508 jin per mu, an increase of 77% compared to last year. The broad masses of commune members are all jubilant, elated, and celebrating the harvest. Currently, the commune members are vigorously rushing to harvest and thresh, carefully harvesting and threshing, determined to get all the fruits of the harvest into their hands.

    大旱年获得了大丰收
    我们河南鲁山县马楼人民公社，从去年种麦开始到小麦抽穗灌浆，有二百多天没下过一场透雨。这是多少年来没有过的大旱灾，要在旧社会，就成了大的灾荒年。可是，在实现了人民公社化的今天，不但没有成灾，相反全社的小麦播种面积比去年扩大了九千多亩，并取得了大旱年间的大丰收。
    我们公社的四万九千多亩小麦，不论山地、平地，还是丘陵、洼地，你在收割以前来到这里便见到处麦浪滚滚，一片丰收景象。一般麦棵三、四尺，每个穗子都有三、四寸长，每穗约有五、六十粒籽，粒粒饱满。虎营大队的田地过去被群众称为“荒草湖”，今年的小麦也获得了大丰收。社员歌唱道：“人民公社像太阳，照的虎营变了样，澎河倒流水利化，荒草湖长出了好庄稼。”王庄大队往年收麦时，割的麦子不够拉，今年全大队的二十七辆牛车全部出动，昼夜不停运不完。麦铺摆满地，麦垛堆积如山。各大队原来造的场和准备的仓库，现在都感到不够用了。
    今年不仅是小麦大丰收，而且是小麦、大麦、豌豆、扁豆样样丰收。有的生产队成倍的增产。全公社已粗打的三千八百四十六亩小麦，平均亩产二百四十四斤，比去年增产19％；已粗打的九百零五亩大麦，平均亩产二百五十二斤，比去年增产20％。历年高产的马楼丰产方，高产再高产，已粗打的三百一十二亩小麦，平均亩产五百零八斤，比去年增产77％。广大社员都是欢天喜地，兴高采烈，庆贺丰收。目前，社员们正在劲头十足地抢收抢打，细收细打，决心把丰收的果实全部拿到手。
