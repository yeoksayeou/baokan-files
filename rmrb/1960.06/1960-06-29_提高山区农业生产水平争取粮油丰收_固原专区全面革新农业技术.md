    Improve Agricultural Production Level in Mountainous Areas and Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Grain and Oil
    Guyuan Prefecture Comprehensively Renews Agricultural Technology
    (Our report) The Guyuan Prefecture in the southern mountainous area of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, closely combines multiple planting with high-yield harvesting, comprehensively innovates agricultural production technology, improves the agricultural production level in mountainous areas, and strives for a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain, oil and other crops this year.
    Guyuan Prefecture is located in the high-altitude, cold, and arid mountainous area of the Liupan Mountains. There is more cultivated land, a shortage of labor, and insufficient fertilizer. In the past, there has always been a contradiction in agricultural production between planting more and not being able to plant well, and planting well and not being able to plant more. Extensive planting with low yields resulted in lower crop yields and a large amount of fallow land each year. This year, the Hui and Han people here have given full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, utilized all arable land, comprehensively arranged the planting of various summer and autumn grain crops and cash crops, and vigorously innovated agricultural technology to ensure both multiple planting and good planting, management and harvesting. As of the end of May, the prefecture had sown more than 6.3 million mu of various crops such as grain, oil, and potatoes, more than 1 million mu more than the same period last year. While expanding the planting area, the People's Communes throughout the prefecture have reformed the farming system and farming techniques in many ways, turning low-yield fields into high-yield fields and low-yield crops into high-yield crops. Before spring sowing, the Guyuan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the local agricultural production experience and proposed measures for double "eight reforms" for grain and oil based on local conditions. From seasonal farming, crop planting, farming systems, planting techniques, and seedling management, it reformed the backward farming habits in mountainous areas and improved the agricultural production level in mountainous areas. The communes first changed the habit of not selecting seeds and delaying the sowing period for a long time. In the past, alpine millet was not planted until "Summer Begins," but this year 500,000 to 600,000 mu of millet had been planted before "Summer Begins." In the past, large areas of fallow land were left every year, but this year most of these fallow lands have been planted with various summer and autumn crops. In addition, more than 200,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. In the past, fields sown under white stubble were plowed more than 90% this year, and harrowed and rolled two or three times before sowing to conserve moisture. In terms of fertilization and planting, the counties throughout the prefecture also implemented methods such as moving livestock pens to the mountains, sheep pens at the head of the fields, and fertilizer accumulation stations in remote mountains, so that 90% of the fields were fertilized; and strip planting replaced the backward broadcast planting of the past. On the basis of improving farming techniques, 1.3 million mu of contiguous "three fields" (cadre experimental fields, high-yield demonstration fields, and large-area high-yield fields) have been established. Due to changes in farming techniques and the implementation of intensive cultivation and fine work, more than 1.8 million mu of wheat in the region are growing well. The communes have organized a field management army of 40,000 to 50,000 people, setting off a high tide of seedling-stage field management centered on weeding, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and irrigating. Many remote fields that were not weeded in the past have been weeded this year. This mountainous area has always been rich in the oil crop flax, but because of rough cultivation, the yield was not high. This year, the Guyuan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the high-yield experience of some local communes in flax, and proposed comprehensive changes in technical measures for oil crops. The communes and production teams also comprehensively arranged the planting of oil crops and improved farming techniques. Many communes chose to plant oil crops on upper stubble land and strong land, so the growth is generally better than last year.

    提高山区农业生产水平争取粮油丰收
    固原专区全面革新农业技术
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区南部山区的固原专区，把多种多收与高产多收密切结合，全面革新农业生产技术，提高山区农业生产水平，争取山区今年粮、油等各种作物全面丰收。
    固原专区地处六盘山一带高寒、干旱的山区。耕地较多，劳动力缺少，肥料不足，过去在农业生产上一直存在着多种就不能种好，种好就不能多种的矛盾。广种薄收，农作物产量较低，每年还留有大量的轮歇地。今年这里回汉族人民充分发挥人民公社的优越性，利用一切可耕种的土地，全面布局，扩种各种夏、秋粮食作物和经济作物，同时大力革新农业技术，既保证多种，又保证种好、管好、收好。截至5月底，全专区已播种粮、油、薯等各种作物六百三十多万亩，较去年同期多种一百余万亩。在扩大种植面积的同时，全专区各人民公社从多方面改革耕作制度和耕作技术，变低产田为高产田，变低产作物为高产作物。中共固原地委在春播前就总结了当地农业生产经验，因地制宜的提出了粮、油双“八改”的措施，从农时季节、作物种植、耕作制度、种植技术、苗禾管理等各个方面改革山区落后的耕作习惯，提高山区农业生产水平。各公社首先改变了不选种和播种期拖得很长的习惯。过去
  “立夏”才种高山糜，今年没到“立夏”就已种糜子五、六十万亩。过去每年都留有大片的轮歇地，今年这些轮歇地大都已种植了各种夏、秋作物。另外还开荒二十多万亩。过去白槎下种的田地，今年90％以上都进行了翻犁，播种前还耙、耱保墒两三遍。在施肥、种植上全专区各县还实行了畜圈上山、地头羊圈、远山积肥站等办法，使90％的田地都施了肥；并以条播代替了过去落后的撒播种植。在提高耕作技术的基础上，建立了连片种植的“三田”
  （干部试验田、高额丰产田、大面积丰产田）一百三十万亩。由于改变耕作技术，实行精耕细作，全区的一百八十多万亩小麦，苗势长得好。各公社共组织了四、五万人的田间管理大军，掀起以锄草、防治病虫害、灌水等为中心的苗期田间管理高潮。很多过去不锄草的远山田地，今年都锄了草。这个山区历来盛产油料作物胡麻，但是因为耕作粗糙，产量不高。今年中共固原地委总结了当地有些公社胡麻高产的经验，提出了全面改变油料作物技术措施。各公社和生产队也全面安排了油料作物的种植，改进了耕作技术，很多公社选择了上槎地、壮地种植油料作物，因此，生长普遍比去年好。
