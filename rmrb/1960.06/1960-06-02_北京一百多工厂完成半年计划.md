Extensively Promote Advanced Experiences, Solidly Consolidate Innovation Achievements

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: According to incomplete statistics as of the end of May, 133 factories in Beijing, including Beijing Automotive Manufacturing Plant, North China Wireless Appliance Factory, Fengtai Bridge Factory, Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory, and Beijing Tongyi Water Pump Factory, have completed their half-year production plans ahead of schedule.

On the basis of the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, these factories have closely integrated with current production, conducted a comprehensive summary, inspection, evaluation, popularization, and improvement of innovation achievements, and comprehensively promoted important advanced experiences and new technologies, thus ensuring the early completion of production plans. The Beijing Automotive Manufacturing Plant promoted 26 important advanced experiences in various workshops throughout the factory through various methods such as holding on-site meetings, inviting people in to teach, and sending people out to learn. By the 22nd of last month, it had completed 55% of the annual national plan, and labor productivity had increased by 1.37 times compared with the same period last year. The Fengtai Bridge Factory, due to the upsurge of mass promotion of advanced experience, completed the May production plan six days ahead of schedule, and then completed the half-year plan in an all-round way. The total output value doubled compared with the same period last year, the product output increased by more than doubled, labor productivity increased by 113.8%, and the cost reduced by 2.5%.

Leading cadres at all levels of many factories have gone deep into the front line of production, inspected production every day and every shift, and solved problems in a timely manner, which played an important role in ensuring the early completion of the plan. The factory director and Party branch secretary of Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory and Beijing Tongyi Water Pump Factory, in addition to checking the completion of the production plan every day, also worked with the workers to study and solve problems in production. The two factories completed their half-year plans on May 30, exceeding the plan by 31% and 105% respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 1st: Fangzi and Linyi Coal Mines, two large local state-owned mines in Shandong, both reported good news in coal mining and tunneling. As of May 28, the raw coal output of the two mines has completed 69% of the annual plan, and the total tunneling progress has completed 61% of the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 1st: As a result of the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution by the staff and workers of Xinwen Mining Bureau in Shandong, the semi-annual raw coal production plan was completed 33 days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the footage of the main roadway tunneling also increased by 72.8% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, June 1st: The technical innovation movement of the Dashitou Coal Mine in Ningxia was closely integrated with production, and the semi-annual production plan for this year was completed ahead of schedule by May 20.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 31st: The Wangfenggang Washing Plant of Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui has completed the semi-annual production task ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. As of May 25, the plant had completed 51.2% of the annual production plan; the ash content of refined coal was 0.3% lower than the national plan, achieving a double leap in high yield and high quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 31st: All the staff and workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have successfully completed half of the national annual plan ahead of schedule. As of the end of May, the bureau had completed 391 key construction projects, with a total construction area of 265,000 square meters.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the bureau completed 18 automatic construction lines, 75 linkage lines, improved more than 10,000 tools, and self-made more than 700 new machines. More than 20% of the vehicles in the bureau exceeded 10,000 ton-kilometers per ton-month. Therefore, the bureau not only achieved increased production without increasing manpower in construction, but also transferred more than 4,000 people to enrich enterprises producing building materials. The bureau vigorously promoted the production of building materials. The bureau and various engineering companies have building material production systems, such as cement plants, steel plants, brick plants, lime plants, quarries, steelmaking plants, rolling steel plants, glass fiber plants, and silicate block plants. These factories produced 4,706 tons of cement and 2,346,000 bricks from January to May, solving the problem of insufficient supply of these materials and ensuring the needs of rapid construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 31st: The Handan Metallurgical Mining Company of Hebei Province had completed the semi-annual iron ore production plan 35 days ahead of schedule by the 26th. The quality of iron ore met national requirements. Compared with the same period last year, the average daily output increased by 39.3%, the efficiency of all employees increased by 24.5%, and the production cost decreased by 38.1%.

Under the slogan of "Catching up in everything, striving for the upstream at all times," the staff and workers of the company launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement at the beginning of this year. Aiming at the key problems in production, they adopted the method of "mainly relying on local methods, combining local and foreign methods" and realized more than 2,000 major innovation projects, ensuring the continuous improvement of the production level.

The leaders at all levels of the company, in the spirit of grasping early and grasping firmly, grasped measures and implemented plans at all levels, making management work more and more detailed. Since the beginning of this year, most of the teams in the company have completed or overfulfilled the production plan every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 31st: Xiangtan Power Plant has completed the semi-annual production plan in an all-round way 34 days ahead of schedule. As of May 27, it had completed 60.8% of this year's annual output value and output plan, completed 141% of labor productivity, reduced costs by 7.32%, saved 645,000 kWh of electricity, and achieved safe production.

Vigorously carrying out technical revolution, tapping the potential of equipment, and shortening the overhaul period are important reasons for the sustained leap in production of this plant. Since the beginning of this year, all the staff and workers of the plant have put forward 1,150 innovation proposals, realized 713 items, and broken through 45 major key points.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 1st: Xining Telecommunications Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant has achieved the goal of "completing half of the annual plan in half a year" ahead of schedule. As of May 23, the total output value completed by the plant accounted for 54% of the annual plan; the output of major products also exceeded the plan in an all-round way.

This factory is a "poor" factory, with simple equipment and a lack of technical strength. There are only seven or eight old workers in the factory, and all the rest are apprentices. However, under the strong leadership of the Party organization, all the staff and workers were not intimidated by "poverty" at all. They gave full play to the spirit of "poor sticks," dared to think and dared to do. If they didn't have equipment, they made it themselves; if they didn't have technology, they learned it themselves; if they didn't have materials, they looked for it everywhere, and quickly changed the production face of the whole factory. They adopted the method of teaching while learning, learning while using, and those who are capable are teachers, and quickly improved the technical level of the staff and workers; they adopted methods such as making use of waste and repairing old items, and making substitutions, and solved 90% of the materials used by the whole factory. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has produced a large number of telegraph machines, DC conference telephones, rectifiers and other communication equipment urgently needed in rural areas, which has played an important role in accelerating the socialist construction of rural areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 1st: Hangzhou Doujinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, which won the Red Flag Award of the National Heroes Conference, has completed more than half of the annual output value and output plan ahead of schedule at the end of May, and the quality has reached 100%.

In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, the factory adopted the method of comprehensive planning and staged breakthroughs, and quickly completed a large number of innovation projects. Then, after summarizing, appraising, and popularizing, more than 2,300 innovative equipment and tools were quickly put into production.
