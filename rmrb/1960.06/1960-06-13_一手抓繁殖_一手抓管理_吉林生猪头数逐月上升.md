Jilin Province is vigorously establishing pig farms and expanding its sow herd, grasping breeding with one hand and feeding management with the other, prompting the number of pigs to rise in a straight line month by month, creating favorable conditions for greatly accumulating fine fertilizer. According to statistics from mid-May, excluding those sold to the state and consumed by commune members, the province's pig inventory has reached 3.16 million head, a net increase of 30.3% compared to the end of 1959. Currently, there are also 330,000 pregnant sows in the province that are giving birth one after the other.

Seriously implementing the policy of "collective raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement," and adopting the approach of establishing farms at four levels (county, commune, management district, production team), while adhering to the principle of "self-breeding, self-raising," is the main key to ensuring the rapid development of pig production. Since last winter, the province has established more than 43,900 collective pig farms, and the proportion of collectively raised pigs has increased from 50% to 71.6%, which has created favorable conditions for expanding the sow herd. Various pig farms have adopted the method of retaining all sows seen, retaining the earlier ones first and then selecting the later ones, so that the number of sows has grown to 719,000, of which 470,000 have already bred, and most of the rest can produce a litter of piglets before the end of the year.

Vigorously grasping breeding, feeding management, and epidemic prevention measures is another reason for the high-speed development of pig production. The province has established a professional team of more than 69,000 people in feeding, mating, delivery, epidemic prevention, etc., thereby continuously improving the level of scientific feeding management and mating technology. In terms of mating, more than 500 artificial insemination stations have been established. In terms of feeding management, advanced management methods of group and separate feeding of boars, sows, pregnant pigs, and piglets, as well as fixed breeding, fixed survival rate, fixed fatness, fixed feed, and timed feeding have been widely promoted.

In order to ensure that the number of pigs rises month by month, a mass movement of "one sow, hundreds of offspring" and "millions of offspring" is being carried out in depth, and the total number of high-yielding sows in the province has grown to more than 50,000. The survival rate of piglets has consistently been above 80%.

In order to ensure the needs of the high-speed development of pigs and large livestock, various localities have planted a large area of feed during spring sowing. By mid-May, the province had planted more than 600,000 mu. Now, various localities are still adopting the method of taking advantage of every available space to plant feed.

### 一手抓繁殖  一手抓管理  吉林生猪头数逐月上升

    一手抓繁殖  一手抓管理
    吉林生猪头数逐月上升
    本报长春12日电　吉林省大办养猪场，扩大母猪群，一手抓繁殖，一手抓饲养管理，促使养猪头数逐旬逐月地直线上升，为大积精肥创造了有利条件。据5月中旬统计，除卖给国家和社员自食的以外，全省生猪存栏数已达三百一十六万头，比1959年底净增30．3％。现在全省还有三十三万头怀胎母猪正陆续产仔。
    认真贯彻执行“公养为主、私养为辅”的政策，采取四级（县、公社、管理区、生产队）办场，坚持“自繁、自养”的方针，是保证生猪生产飞速发展的主要关键。从去冬以来，全省共办起集体养猪场四万三千九百多处，集体养猪的比重由50％提高到71．6％，这样就为扩大母猪群创造了良好条件。各养猪场采取见母就留先留后选的方法，使母猪头数已发展到七百一十九万头，其中已繁殖的母猪达四十七万头，其余大部分年前均可产一窝仔猪。
    狠抓繁殖、饲养管理、防疫等措施，是生猪高速度发展的另一个原因。全省在饲养、配种、接产、防疫等方面建立起六万九千多人的专业队伍，从而使科学饲养管理水平和配种技术不断提高。在配种方面，建立起人工授精站五百多处。在饲养管理上普遍推行了公猪、母猪、孕猪、仔猪分群、分槽饲养和定繁殖、定成活、定膘头、定饲料、定时喂的先进管理方法。
    为了保证养猪头数逐月上升，一个全民的“一母百子孙”和“百万子孙”的高产运动正在深入开展，全省高产母猪的总头数已发展到五万多头。仔猪成活率一直占80％以上。
    为了保证生猪和大家畜高速度发展需要，各地在春播中已大面积的种植饲料，到5月中旬全省已种六十多万亩。现在各地仍采取见缝插针的方法，利用零星土地种饲料。（附图片）
