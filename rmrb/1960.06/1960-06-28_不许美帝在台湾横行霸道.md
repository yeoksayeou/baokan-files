    No American Imperialist Hegemony Allowed in Taiwan
    Student Militia Representative Luo Jianmin

    Comrades,

    American imperialism has forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan for ten years. For ten years, American imperialism has acted with hegemony in Taiwan and has continuously carried out military provocations against our mainland, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Our capital's militia firmly opposes American imperialism's aggression and is determined to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace!

    The students of our capital will never forget the nearly hundred years of trampling of our people by American imperialism, nor will they forget the towering crimes of American imperialism colluding with Chiang Kai-shek to launch a counter-revolutionary war, massacring our people, over a decade ago; nor will they forget the people of Taiwan who live in deep water and scorching fire. American imperialism has forged a blood feud with us. We are irreconcilable with American imperialism. Every crime of American imperialism against the Chinese people has been recorded by us, without exception. One day, we will thoroughly settle accounts with American imperialism and demand repayment of all blood debts!

    American imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, but also the mortal enemy of the people of the world. The crimes committed by American imperialism against the people of all countries have aroused increasingly fierce resistance everywhere. American imperialism and its running dogs have fallen into the encirclement of the world's people's anger. The loyal running dogs of American imperialism have collapsed one after another. Eisenhower's trip to the Far East was met with fierce attacks from the masses of the people everywhere, which further demonstrates that American imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation!

    We pay tribute to the fighting Japanese people, to the fighting South Korean people, to the fighting Turkish people, to the fighting Cuban people, to the fighting Algerian people, to all the people in the struggle against imperialism, to the heroic students of all countries, and to the heroic Japanese national hero, Michiko Kamba, who sacrificed herself!

    We, the student militia of the capital, swear to the great motherland: We must study hard, intensify military training, and strive to build our country into a strong socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense! We, the capital's militia, are ready at any time to liberate the sacred territory of Taiwan together with the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate it from the face of the earth!

    We must liberate Taiwan!

    Resolutely smash the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism!

    Defend world peace! (Attached pictures)

    不许美帝在台湾横行霸道
    学生民兵代表  罗健敏同志们：
    美帝国主义用武力霸占我国领土台湾已经十年了。十年来，美帝国主义在台湾横行霸道，并且不断向我国大陆进行军事挑衅，做尽了一切坏事，我们首都民兵坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，坚决要解放台湾，保卫世界和平！
    我们首都学生永远忘不了近百年来美帝国主义对
  我国人民的蹂躏，忘不了十几年前美帝国主义勾结蒋介石发动反人民的战争，屠杀我国人民的滔天罪行；忘不了生活在水深火热之中的台湾人民。美帝国主义与我们结下了血海深仇，我们和美帝国主义誓不两立，美帝国主义对中国人民的每一次罪行，我们都一笔不差地记了下来，总有一天，我们要向美帝国主义
  彻底清算，讨还全部血债！
    美帝国主义不但是中国人民的死敌，也是全世界人民的死敌，美帝国主义对世界各国人民犯下的罪行，到处激起了愈来愈猛烈的反抗，美帝国主义及其走狗已经陷入世界人民怒火包围之中。美帝国主义的忠实走狗一个个垮台了。艾森豪威尔在远东的旅行，到处受到人民群众的猛烈打击，这更表明了美帝国主义已陷入空前孤立的境地！
    我们向战斗的日本人民致敬，向战斗的南朝鲜人民致敬，向战斗的土耳其人民致敬，向战斗的古巴人民致敬，向战斗的阿尔及利亚人民致敬，向一切在反对帝国主义斗争中的人民致敬，向英勇斗争的各国学生致敬，向英勇牺牲的日本民族英雄桦美智子致敬！
    我们首都的学生民兵，向伟大的祖国宣誓：我们一定要努力学习，加紧练兵，为把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国而奋斗！我们首都民兵随时准备，和英雄的中国人民解放军一起，解放祖国神圣的领土台湾。美帝国主义如果竟敢发动侵略战争，我们一定要坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把它从地球上消灭掉！
    我们一定要解放台湾！
    坚决粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策！
    保卫世界和平！（附图片）
