According to the Hubei Daily, as June arrived, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to action to workers on the industrial and transportation fronts throughout the province: "Mobilize the entire party, conduct thorough rectification, greatly boost morale, fight greatly in June, push the technical revolution movement to a higher stage, direct the spearhead of the technical revolution towards the main attack direction, ensure the victory of the steel battle centered on coal, iron, ore, and transportation, and strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year!"

The Provincial Committee pointed out that June is a crucial moment of decision, and we must seize the time, race against the clock, grasp speed, and see practical results. This is an important test for Party organizations at all levels throughout the province. Therefore, we must pay attention to the following three simultaneous efforts. First, we must adhere to the simultaneous efforts of grasping coal, iron, ore, and transportation and grasping the technical revolution. We must place coal, iron, ore, and transportation in an important position, and we must carry out the technical revolution to the end. Second, ensuring the completion of production plans must go hand in hand with vigorously developing comprehensive utilization and diversified operations. At present, we must prominently emphasize completing product output plans and product matching, and delivering goods according to contracts. Not only must they be produced, but they must also be transported out to have use value. Third, making a concentrated effort on coal, iron, and ore must go hand in hand with preparing to establish small-scale foreign-style groups and small-scale indigenous groups on a large scale. We must grasp current production and prepare for the next step. We must grasp the center and make comprehensive arrangements. We must implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" so that coal, iron, ore, transportation, technical revolution, comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, and small-scale foreign-style groups and small-scale indigenous groups can blossom and bear fruit simultaneously. This is the great, glorious, and arduous task that the current situation requires us to complete.

The Provincial Committee also put forward ten measures to ensure the victory of the steel battle centered on coal, iron, ore, and transportation. The first is to strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial production. Party organizations at all levels throughout the province must resolutely and comprehensively implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, and simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture." We must continue to strengthen all work to support agriculture and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. At the same time, we must recognize that increasing the production of steel, iron, and coal can accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and promote a greater leap forward in agriculture. The second is to oppose right-leaning, slackening, and fear of difficulties, greatly boost morale, and erect red flags everywhere. Emphasize that leading cadres should go to the front line, lead cadres to go deep into production, adhere to the "three togethers" (eating, living, and working together with the masses), summarize experience at any time, and solve problems in a timely manner. The third is to grasp progress and grasp evaluation and comparison. The establishment of a steel production command in Wuhan is a good experience, and all localities should follow suit. The fourth is to rely on technical innovation and technical revolution to increase the production of raw materials at high speed, first and foremost coal and iron. The fifth is to grasp transportation. One is the current coal mine transportation problem; the second is to make a concentrated effort to build small railways for transporting coal, which must be completed within a time limit; the third is to fully exploit transportation potential and further improve the dragon-net system. The sixth is to grasp the arrangement of labor. The labor saved through technical revolution should first meet the needs of the unit's expansion and the establishment of satellite factories, and the surplus should be reported to the higher-level Party committee for unified adjustment locally. The seventh is to grasp the conservation of raw materials and continue to promote effective advanced experiences and technologies. The eighth is to grasp livelihood and grasp safety. From the Provincial Committee to the branch, we must grasp production with one hand and livelihood with the other, and we must grasp livelihood well. Labor and rest are also two legs, and good rest is a necessary condition for good labor. All Party committees of industrial and transportation enterprises must have a deputy secretary in charge of livelihood, and leading cadres must eat in the canteen; we must now do a good job in preventing heatstroke and cooling down. The ninth is that leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should, according to the above requirements, divide up the tasks, break through key points, make models, and erect red flags everywhere. The tenth is to comprehensively promote Shashi's leadership experience of taking the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the driving force, taking the technical revolution as the center, and closely combining the technical revolution, ideological revolution, and cultural revolution, and forge ahead to achieve the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

    中共湖北省委向全省职工发出号召
    抢时间　争分秒　抓速度　大战六月
    提出十大措施，确保钢铁战役的胜利，力争上半年完成全年计划一半
    据湖北日报消息　跨进6月，中共湖北省委向全省工业和交通运输战线职工发出了：“全党动员、深入整风、大鼓干劲、大战6月，把技术革命运动推向更高阶段，把技术革命的矛头指向主攻方向，确保以煤、铁、矿、运为中心的钢铁战役的胜利，力争上半年完成全年计划的一半”的号召。
    省委指出，6月份是决战时刻，必须抢时间，争分秒，抓速度，见实效。这对于全省各级党组织来说，是一个重要的考验。因此，必须注意以下三个并举。首先要坚持抓煤、铁、矿、运和抓技术革命同时并举。一定要把煤、铁、矿、运摆到重要位置，一定要把技术革命进行到底。其次，保证完成生产计划，要和大搞综合利用、多种经营同时并举。目前必须突出地强调完成产品产量计划和产品配套、按合同交货。不仅要生产出来，而且要运出来，才有使用价值。其三，突击煤、铁、矿、运要和准备大办小洋群、小土群同时并举。既要抓住当前生产，又要为下一步作好准备。既要抓住中心，又要全面安排。一定要贯彻执行“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针，使煤、铁、矿、运、技术革命、综合利用多种经营、小洋群小土群同时开花结果。这就是目前形势所要求我们完成的伟大的、光荣的、艰巨的任务。
    省委还提出了确保以煤、铁、矿、运为中心的钢铁战役获得胜利的十大措施。第一条是，加强党对工业生产的领导，全省各级党组织，必须坚决地全面地贯彻执行“农业为基础、工业为主导、工业同农业同时并举”的方针。必须继续加强工业支援农业的各项工作，力夺今年的农业大丰收。同时，必须认识到增加钢、铁、煤的生产，才能加速农业的技术改造，促进农业更大的跃进。第二条是，反对右倾松劲畏难情绪，大鼓干劲，大插红旗。强调大员上前线，带领干部深入生产，坚持“三同”，随时总结经验，及时解决问题。第三条是，抓进度，抓评比。武汉市成立钢铁生产指挥部是一项好经验，各地都应当仿行。第四条是，依靠技术革新和技术革命，高速度地增产原材料。首先是煤铁。第五条是，抓运输。一是当前的煤矿运输问题；二是突击修建运煤的小铁路，要限期完成；三是充分发挥运输潜力，要进一步搞好龙网化。第六条是，抓劳动力安排。经过技术革命节约下来的劳动力，首先满足本单位的扩建和举办卫星厂的需要，多余的要报告上级党委在本地统一调剂。第七条是，抓原材料节约、继续推广行之有效的先进经验与技术。第八条是，抓生活、抓安全。从省委到支部，都必须一手抓生产，一手抓生活，一定要把生活抓好。劳动与休息也是两条腿，休息好是劳动好的必要条件，所有工业交通运输企业党委要有一个副书记抓生活，领导干部都要吃食堂；现在就要做好防暑降温工作。第九条是，各级领导机关领导干部，要根据上述要求，分片包干，突破重点，作出样版，大插红旗。第十条是，全面推广沙市的以学习毛泽东思想为动力，以技术革命为中心，把技术革命、思想革命、文化革命紧密结合在一起的领导经验，为实现上半年完成全年计划的一半而奋勇前进。
