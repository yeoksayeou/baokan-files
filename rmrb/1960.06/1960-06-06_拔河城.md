People say Mei-liu Town (location of the Mei-liu Commune in Huazhou County, Guangdong) is a "tug-of-war town," and it truly lives up to its name. As the sun sets, after dinner, people pour in teams and groups from all corners to the sports field to participate in or watch tug-of-war competitions. Engaging in this kind of activity after work has become a habit. A single competition often has twenty or thirty teams participating, attracting thousands of spectators. Some factory Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and enterprise managers personally lead their employees to participate in the tug-of-war, acting as commanders; some families come out to watch the battle. Before and after the competition, one can hear the masses talking at length about the strategy and tactics of tug-of-war, saying that this team won't make it, the commander lacks enthusiasm, and the team members don't concentrate their efforts, so they lost; and saying that that team's commander was effective, the team members were united, their strength was focused, and their stances were good, so they won. The lively scene is like the folk song of the masses sings:

	Wife pulls the rope to compete for heroism,
	Husband holds child to cheer.
	Mother-in-law commands effectively,
	Child shouts until their throat is hoarse.

Why is the tug-of-war movement so lively in Mei-liu Town? Originally, during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the commune established a sports association. Based on the interests of the masses, they believed that carrying out tug-of-war was simple and easy, not restricted by venue, number of people, or time, and it was also highly competitive and easy to attract the masses. Therefore, they seized this key to mobilize the masses to participate in sports. On the basis of carrying out tug-of-war, they also carried out various sports activities such as broadcast exercises, running, martial arts, and swimming according to the conditions of various industries. At present, more than 30,000 people in the entire commune participate in sports activities every day, accounting for 45% of the total population of the commune. Comrade Li Yaoming, deputy director of the leather factory, said: "Our leather workshop has thirty-four people. In the past, they would feel dizzy after making an average of twenty-seven pairs of shoes a day. After participating in sports exercises and technical innovations, they can now make an average of sixty-seven pairs of shoes a day and still feel energetic." The employees of the service industry said: "In the past, we worked non-stop from morning to night, not seeing the sun early and not seeing the sandbar late. Now we do opening exercises and closing exercises. Sometimes everyone participates in activities at the sports field in batches, feeling refreshed, energetic, and nimble." The members of the Sanji-Hua brigade generally reflected: "During the intense period of rice transplanting, we do five minutes of field exercises after transplanting each paddy field to eliminate fatigue, give energy to production, and improve efficiency."

    拔河城
    人们说梅六镇（广东化州县梅六公社所在地）是个“拔河城”，真是名不虚传。夕阳西下，人们用过晚饭，一队队一群群从各个角落涌到运动场来参加或观看拔河比赛。劳动之后举行这种活动，已经成为习惯。一场比赛经常有二、三十个队参加，吸引观众几千人。有些工厂的党委书记、厂长和企业的经理亲自带领职工参加拔河比赛，担任指挥；有的全家出来观战。在比赛前后，可以听到群众大谈拔河的战略战术，说这个队不成，指挥员劲头不大，队员用力不集中，所以输了；又说那个队指挥得力，队员齐心，力量集中，马步好，所以胜利。热闹的情景像群众的山歌所唱的一样：
    妻子拔河争英雄，丈夫抱子助威风。
    婆婆指挥真得法，娃娃喊破了喉咙。
    为什么拔河运动在梅六镇搞得那么热闹呢？原来在1958年大跃进的时候，公社成立了体育协会，根据群众的爱好，认为开展拔河运动简单易行，不受场地、人数、时间的限制，而且竞赛性强，易吸引群众，于是就抓住这把钥匙来发动群众参加体育运动。在开展拔河运动的基础上，又根据各行各业的情况开展广播操、跑步、武术、游泳等各种各样的体育活动。目前全公社每天参加体育活动的达三万多人，占全社总人口45％。皮革厂副厂长李耀明同志说：“我们的制革车间三十四人，过去平均每天做鞋二十七双就头晕眼花了，参加体育锻炼，加上技术革新后平均每天做鞋六十七双，精神仍然充沛。”服务业的职工说：“以前从早到晚，手脚不停，早不见日头，晚不见沙洲，现在搞开门操、关门操，有时大家还分批到运动场参加活动，感到心情舒畅，精神充沛，手脚灵活。”三基华大队的社员普遍反映说：我们在紧张的插秧大忙期间每插一丘田，做五分钟田间操，消除疲劳，生产有劲，效率提高。（附图片）
