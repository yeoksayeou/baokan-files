Xinhua News Agency, June 27th—On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialist occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee received telegrams from the Korean National Peace Committee and the Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, expressing their militant support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The telegrams stated that ten years ago, U.S. imperialists, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, sent armed forces to occupy Taiwan, thereby disrupting peace in the Far East and Asia and committing despicable crimes against the people of Korea and China. U.S. imperialists still occupy South Korea and Taiwan to this day, hoping to reverse their past failures and attempt to launch a new war of aggression. But reality shows that no conspiracy can help U.S. imperialists avoid destruction. The great achievements made by China and Korea, who have joined the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in socialist construction, and the militant friendship between the two peoples forged in blood, are not only a solid guarantee of our independence and freedom, but also a solid guarantee of peace and security in the Far East and Asia.

The telegrams pointed out that Taiwan has belonged to the Chinese people since ancient times, and the just struggle of the Chinese people has received the heartfelt support of the people of Asia and the world. The Korean people, together with their Chinese friends, will never tolerate the U.S. military occupation of South Korea and Taiwan.

The telegrams concluded by saying that U.S. imperialists must immediately get out of South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and other countries. The Korean people are deeply convinced that the struggle of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious, and they express their militant support to the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th—The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation today received telegrams from the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League and the Korean Student Committee.

The telegrams said: "The U.S. imperialists' despicable conspiracies and policies of aggression to launch a new war are constantly being exposed and crushed in the face of the heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China and all peace-loving people of all countries. The heroic and just struggle of the Chinese youth, students, and all the Chinese people against U.S. imperialist aggression has received the active support of the Korean people and the people of Asian countries. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Chinese people and youth and students to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Taiwan and liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious! U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan and South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam and all of Asia!"

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, June 26th—According to the Mongolian "Truth Daily," the Mongolian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and the Presidium of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association held an enlarged joint meeting here on the 24th to support China's Anti-American Propaganda Week activities.

Tumenjargal and other members of the Presidium of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association spoke at the meeting, protesting against U.S. imperialism's illegal occupation of China's territory Taiwan and threatening the security of the people of Asian and Far Eastern countries.

At the meeting, Namsrai, Secretary of the Mongolian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, read out a protest against U.S. imperialism's illegal occupation of China's territory Taiwan.

    电报说，十年前，美国帝国主义者在发动侵朝战争的同时，派武装部队占领了台湾，从而破坏了远东和亚洲和平，对朝鲜和中国的人民犯下了卑鄙的罪行。美国帝国主义者直到现在还占领着南朝鲜和台湾，他们指望挽回过去的失败，企图发动新的侵略战争。但是现实情况表明，任何阴谋诡计都不能帮助美帝国主义者避免灭亡。加入了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭的朝中两国在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就，以及两国人民之间用鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊，不仅是我们的独立和自由的牢固保障，而且也是远东和亚洲的和平和安全的牢固保障。
    电报指出，台湾自古以来就是属于中国人民的，中国人民的正义斗争，受到亚洲和世界各国人民的衷心支持。朝鲜人民同中国朋友一道，决不容忍美国军队对南朝鲜和台湾的占领。
    电报最后说，美帝国主义者必须立即滚出南朝鲜、台湾、日本和其他国家。朝鲜人民深信六亿中国人民争取解放台湾的斗争一定会获得胜利，并且对中国人民表示战斗的声援。
