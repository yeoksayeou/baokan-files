Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Washington Dispatch: The United States' appropriation for military "aid" to the Far East in the next fiscal year will increase by approximately 25% compared to the current fiscal year.

This plan for the United States to intensify war preparations in the Far East was revealed during a recent closed-door meeting of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on "Mutual Security" and was publicized on the eve of Eisenhower's visit to the Far East.

The testimony of Edward O'Donnell, Director of the Far East International Security Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of Defense, at the closed-door hearing indicated that the revival of Japanese militarism as a tool of U.S. imperialism is an important part of the U.S. foreign military "aid" program. O'Donnell said that since 1952, the United States has provided $796 million in military "aid" to Japan. At the same time, Japan has paid the United States nearly $1 billion as maintenance costs for U.S. troops and bases in Japan.

O'Donnell also said that the United States plans to continue providing military "aid" to Japan on the basis of so-called cost-sharing. On this basis, Japan will have to spend more money on expanding its arms and preparing for war.

It is estimated that the United States will provide approximately $75 million to manufacture "Star" jet fighters in Japan. O'Donnell said the United States will help Japan build warships. He said the United States will also give Japan's destroyers and air force some secret equipment.

O'Donnell said that the main purpose of the United States increasing military "aid" to the Philippines is to strengthen the Philippine Air Force. He frankly admitted that in the Philippines, "the United States has extremely important strategic bases."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Washington Dispatch: On the eve of his "visit" to the Far East (11th), U.S. President Eisenhower telegraphed influential members of the U.S. Congress, insisting that a very large "foreign aid" appropriation must be maintained in order to pursue his aggressive policy.

Eisenhower's proposed foreign military and economic "aid" appropriation for the next year is $4.175 billion. The House Appropriations Subcommittee had recommended a reduction of $800 million. This recommendation will be submitted to the House Appropriations Committee for discussion on the 13th.

Eisenhower made no secret of the aggressive nature of U.S. foreign "aid." He admitted that providing such "aid" is "for our own [the United States'] security and the common defense of the free world." He said that if it were greatly reduced, it "could not but undermine the defense of the free world."

He also said, "Inevitably, reducing military assistance would greatly affect the modernization of the military. This will force the United States to reduce the equipment necessary for maintaining a credible defensive posture for its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Far East."

He said that making cuts "would force the U.S. allies around the Communist perimeter, from (South) Korea all the way to Turkey, to shoulder widespread deficits, which would be harmful to everyone."

Eisenhower requested that most of the reduced appropriations be restored.

    下年度对远东军“援”将增加25％
    艾森豪威尔供认“美援”是为了加强战争机器
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国在下一财政年度对远东军事“援助”的拨款将比本财政年度增加25％左右。
    美国在远东加紧备战的这个计划，是在最近美国众议院拨款小组委员会就“共同安全”问题召开的秘密会议上透露的，并且已经在艾森豪威尔访问远东的前夕公布。
    美国国防部远东国际安全事务局局长爱德华·奥当纳在秘密的意见听取会上的证词表明，复活作为美帝国主义侵略工具的日本军国主义，是美国对外军事“援助”计划的一个重要部分。奥当纳说，自从1952年以来，美国在对日本的军事“援助”方面提供了七亿九千六百万美元。同时，日本向美国支付了几乎相当于十亿美元的巨款，作为美国在日本的军队和基地的维持费用。
    奥当纳还说，美国计划在所谓分担费用的基础上继续给予日本军事“援助”。在这个基础上，日本将不得不在扩军备战方面花更多的钱。
    据估计，美国将提供大约七千五百万美元以便在日本制造“星”式喷气战斗机。奥当纳说，美国将帮助日本制造军舰。他说，美国还将给日本的驱逐舰和空军以一些秘密的装备。
    奥当纳说，美国增加对菲律宾的军事“援助”的主要目的，是加强菲律宾的空军。他直率地承认，在菲律宾，“美国有极其重要的战略基地”。
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在前往远东“访问”的前夕（11日）打电报给美国国会有势力的议员，坚持必须保持十分庞大的“援外”拨款，以便推行其侵略政策。
    艾森豪威尔提出的下一年度对外军事和经济“援助”拨款是四十一亿七千五百万美元。众议院拨款小组委员会曾经建议削减八亿美元。这个建议将在13日提交众议院拨款委员会讨论。
    艾森豪威尔毫不讳言美国的对外“援助”的侵略性本质。他承认，进行这种“援助”是“为了我们自己（美国）的安全和自由世界的共同防务”。他说，如果大大削减，就“不能不破坏自由世界的防务”。
    他还说，“不可避免的，减少军事援助必然会大大影响军队现代化。这将迫使美国对它的北大西洋组织和远东的盟国减少为了保持可靠的防务地位所必需的装备。”
    他说，进行削减“将迫使美国在共产党周围的盟国，从（南）朝鲜一直到土耳其，普遍负担赤字，而这是对大家都有害的”。
    艾森豪威尔要求把削减的大部分拨款恢复过来。
