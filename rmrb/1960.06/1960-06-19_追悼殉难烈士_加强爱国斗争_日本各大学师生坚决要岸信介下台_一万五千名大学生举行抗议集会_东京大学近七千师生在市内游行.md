Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th: Fifteen thousand university students in Tokyo and other parts of Japan, wearing mourning badges, held a rally this morning to protest the Kishi government's massacre of students, demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the abolition of the "Security Treaty."

The rally passed an action plan for today, including holding a demonstration near the Diet building together with workers, and sending representatives to meet with Nobusuke Kishi to demand the immediate resignation of his cabinet.

The rally passed a resolution demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi cabinet and a statement addressed to Nobusuke Kishi himself. The statement said that today is the day the new "Security Treaty" is supposedly "naturally ratified," and Japanese university students are issuing you an ultimatum. Students will launch heroic actions today. The statement said, "Michiko Kamba (the female student killed by police in an anti-American, anti-Kishi demonstration) will forever be in our ranks fighting with us."

Kamba Toshio, a professor at Chuo University and the father of Kamba Michiko, said at the rally that as long as his daughter's sacrifice can contribute to the cause of peace and democracy, he can restrain the personal grief he feels over her death.

Kamba Toshio said he had received many letters of encouragement from people from all walks of life across Japan. One letter read, "For ten years I have supported the Conservative Party. But I will no longer be deceived by them. I have decided to take action and will never let power fall back into the hands of the Conservative Party." Professor Kamba pointed out that people who think the same way as the person who wrote this letter are rapidly increasing.

Student representatives from various regions reported on the protest rallies and indefinite strikes held at their respective schools.

Speakers at the rally included Kiyoshi Katsumada, a representative of the Socialist Party; Hisao Itari, a representative of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty"; Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan; as well as representatives from women's and religious circles.

After the rally, the university students marched in formation toward the Diet building.

Prior to this, a joint memorial service was held for Kamba Michiko at Tokyo University. About six hundred professors, including Tokyo University President Seiichi Kaya, and six thousand students attended the memorial service. After the service, led by Seiichi Kaya, they walked out of the school gate, carrying a portrait of Kamba Michiko to march in the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: The fascist atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi government in persecuting demonstrating students have made faculty and students at various universities in Japan more determined to launch a patriotic struggle to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

Tokyo Institute of Technology announced on the 17th that the entire school would be closed for two days on the 17th and 18th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's crime of killing female student Kamba Michiko. The university's entire faculty held a protest rally that day and issued a statement in the name of the assembly, protesting police brutality, demanding the resignation of the entire Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the immediate dissolution of the Diet. The statement also expressed full support for the statement issued by Tokyo University President Seiichi Kaya on the 16th, and condemned the remarks made by Minister of Education Takechiyo Matsuda regarding this statement.

In his statement on the 16th, Seiichi Kaya protested the fascist crimes of the Kishi Nobusuke government. He also said angrily: "Under the current political situation, it is impossible to educate students." Fearing the remarks of this influential scholar, the Minister of Education of the Kishi Nobusuke government declared that he would "deal with" Seiichi Kaya with a "stern attitude."

Tokyo University of Economics decided to close for one day on the 18th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the police authorities.

More than one hundred and fifty professors and two thousand students from Kyoto University held a school-wide rally on the 17th. The resolution passed by the rally announced that Kyoto University would suspend classes school-wide and struggle to force the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to step down and immediately dissolve the Diet.

Many professors and students from universities in Tokyo have issued statements and held rallies to protest Nobusuke Kishi's massacre of students and demand the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

Six hundred professors and student representatives from Keio University held a rally and issued a statement yesterday, strongly protesting the fascist rule of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and protesting the police killing of students.

Two hundred professors and student representatives from the Department of Education of Tokyo University held a protest rally yesterday, announcing that they could not continue classes and conduct research under the current political chaos.

    大会通过了今天的行动计划，其中包括同工人一起在国会附近举行示威和派代表会见岸信介要求岸内阁立即辞职。
    大会通过了要求岸内阁立即辞职的决议和一项给岸信介本人的声明。声明说，今天是新“安全条约”所谓“自然成立”的日子，日本大学生向你提出最后通牒，学生们今天将展开英勇的行动。声明说，“桦美智子（在反美反岸示威中被警察杀害的女学生）永远在我们的行列中同我们一起战斗”。
    中央大学教授、桦美智子的父亲桦俊雄在集会上讲话说，只要他的女儿的牺牲能有助于和平和民主事业，他便可以克制住因为女儿之死而感到的个人悲痛。
    桦俊雄说，他收到了日本全国各界人民的许多鼓励信。其中有一封信写道，“十年来我一直支持保守党。但是我再也不受他们欺骗了。我决定采取行动，决不让政权重新落入保守党之手。”桦教授指出，同写这封信的人有同样想法的人正在迅速增加。
