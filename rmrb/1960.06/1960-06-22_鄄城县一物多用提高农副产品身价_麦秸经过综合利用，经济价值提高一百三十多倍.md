Juancheng County Multi-Purpose Use Raises the Value of Agricultural and Sideline Products
Wheat Straw经过Comprehensive Utilization Increases Economic Value by More Than 130 Times

(Our report) Juancheng County, Shandong Province, has made great achievements in the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. The number of factories in the county has grown to 644, and the number of processing plants in production teams has grown to more than 4,000. Industrial products have increased from 652 in the fourth quarter of last year to 700. Grain processing, oil extraction, winemaking, papermaking, and other industrial sectors have also changed from seasonal production to year-round production.

The agricultural and sideline products that have been comprehensively utilized in this county include: using wheat straw, multi-spike sorghum stalks, corn stalks, etc., to make sugar, brew wine, brew vinegar, brew soy sauce, roll paper pulp, and make paper; using plant shells to make starch, extract oil, and make feed; and using plant stalk skins and bark to extract rayon, boil glue, and make chemical fertilizers. These agricultural and sideline products have greatly increased in economic value after comprehensive utilization. Many things that could only be used as feed or treated as waste in the past, such as peanut shells, corncobs, and rice bran, have now become good raw materials for extracting ether, furfural, alcohol, and syrup. In addition, many things that originally only had one or two uses now have multiple uses, which greatly increases their economic value. For example, wheat straw, which costs only three cents a catty, increases in economic value by more than 130 times after comprehensive utilization such as making paper. Some things that are harmful to agriculture, such as cogongrass roots, have become raw materials for wineries and starch factories. The vigorous development of comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products has also promoted the development of county and commune industries.

The vigorous development of comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products has also played a significant role in supporting agricultural production and meeting the needs of the people's lives. From January to April this year, the county produced a total of 6.5 million catties of various starches and fermented feed using peanut shells, corncobs, sweet potato vines, and bean pod skins.

    鄄城县一物多用提高农副产品身价
    麦秸经过综合利用，经济价值提高一百三十多倍
    本报讯　山东鄄城县在农副产品综合利用方面，已取得很大成就。全县工厂已发展到六百四十四处，生产队的加工厂发展到四千余个。工业产品由去年第四季度的六百五十二种增加到七百种。粮食加工、榨油、蒸酒、造纸等工业部门，也都由季节性生产变为常年生产。
    这个县已综合利用的农村副产品有：用麦秸、多穗高粱秸、玉米秸等造糖、酿酒、酿醋、酿酱油、轧纸浆、造纸；利用植物的果壳做淀粉、榨油、做饲料；利用植物的秸秆皮和树皮提出人造纤维、熬胶、制化肥等。这些农副产品经过综合利用大大提高了经济价值。过去许多只能做饲料或被人当做废物处理的东西，如花生壳、玉米心、谷糠等，现在都成为提炼乙醚、糠醛、酒精、糖稀的好原料。还有许多东西原来只能有一、两种用途，现在有了多种用途，大大提高了经济价值。譬如麦秸，仅三分钱一斤，经过做纸等综合利用，经济价值提高一百三十多倍。有些对农业有害的东西，如茅根，已成为酒厂、淀粉厂的原料。由于大搞农副产品综合利用，还促进了县社工业的发展。
    大搞农副产品综合利用在支援农业生产和满足人民生活需要方面也起了很大作用。今年1月至4月，全县用花生壳、玉米心、地瓜秧、豆角皮等共生产各种淀粉和发酵饲料六百五十万斤。
