Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: The Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party continued on the 21st and 22nd.

TASS reports: Khrushchev spoke at the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on the 21st.

Khrushchev said that under the pressure of the people's strength, the governments of the imperialist countries had to agree to the summit meeting. However, they directed things beforehand to sabotage the meeting. Khrushchev emphasized that what happened in Paris was not accidental; it was the strategy of imperialism. "The imperialists, headed by the American aggressive bloc, have always opposed the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries."

Khrushchev said that although the Paris meeting was sabotaged by the American aggressive bloc, the international issues that have matured have not disappeared because of this. These issues still urgently need to be resolved. Khrushchev listed these issues: solving the problem of complete disarmament, destroying the means of waging war, and disbanding the armed forces of all countries. Khrushchev said: "The remnants of World War II should be eliminated, a peace treaty should be concluded with the two Germanys, and the West Berlin issue should be resolved on this basis." He said that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are willing to send representatives now to conclude a comprehensive disarmament treaty and a peace treaty with Germany.

Khrushchev pointed out that the espionage intrusions of American aircraft have shown to the people of all countries who do not want war that they must not indulge in illusions, they must not relax their efforts to strive for peace, and they must not believe the words of those who execute the will of imperialism.

Khrushchev said that we do not intend to succumb to provocations, nor do we intend to abandon the general line of our foreign policy. This is the policy of coexistence, the policy of consolidating peace, the policy of easing international tensions and eliminating the "Cold War."

Khrushchev said that the principles put forward by Lenin regarding imperialism are still valid today, but some of the content of these principles refers to the period when the Soviet Union had not yet appeared and other socialist countries had not yet appeared. It is impossible to mechanically repeat Lenin's words about the inevitability of imperialist war. Under modern conditions, war is not inevitable. "Anyone who does not understand this does not believe in the strength and creative potential of the working class, underestimates the power of the socialist camp, and does not believe in the great attraction of socialism."

Khrushchev pointed out that the possibility of imperialists launching a war under modern conditions has not been eliminated, but imperialism does not want to launch a war of self-destruction. If Hitler had known the consequences of launching a war against the Soviet Union, he would not have launched that war. If the imperialists still want to launch a war, then the socialist camp is capable of stopping it.

Khrushchev called the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan a "public slap" to the American president. He said that American militarists have set up military bases everywhere in Japan aimed against the Soviet Union and People's China, and their policy is "one of the basic roots of international tension."

In his speech, Khrushchev advocated the closest cooperation among the socialist countries in developing their economies and in the rational division of labor between them. He said, I think that in the future we will collectively solve the important problems of developing the socialist world system. Only close economic and political cooperation can smoothly advance towards socialism and communism.

Khrushchev said that when the Soviet Union was the only country in the face of a strong camp of imperialist countries, it pursued a peaceful policy. When the forces of peace undoubtedly outweigh the forces of war and aggression, we still pursue this policy.

At the morning session on the 22nd, Deleghici, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Minister of Internal Affairs, spoke. He pointed out that since the "Second Congress" of the Romanian Workers' Party, fundamental changes have taken place in all aspects of Romania, the people's regime has become more consolidated, and the people of the whole country are more closely united around the Workers' Party.

Deleghici said that with the development of socialist construction, the tasks of state organs are becoming greater and greater, and the task of combating illegal phenomena will gradually be undertaken by social organizations – comradely tribunals, but this does not mean that vigilance against bad elements and spies should be relaxed. Especially now, when American imperialism has declared espionage activities as their national policy, it is even more necessary to be vigilant and guard against the sabotage activities of imperialist spies. He said that the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs has received the active support of the broad masses in the struggle against the enemy. The nonsense of the revisionists about weakening the role of the state in socialist construction is an attempt to make the party lose its most important tool.

Deleghici said that the external function of a socialist country is to defend the motherland. He said that as long as imperialism exists, there will be aggression.

Also speaking at the morning session on the 22nd were: I. Martin, First Secretary of the Timisoara State Committee, I. Constantin, representative of Bucharest City, and I. Nagy, representative of Krosz State, etc.

Peng Zhen, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message at the morning meeting on the 22nd and read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. When Comrade Peng Zhen stepped onto the podium, the audience stood up and applauded warmly and for a long time, shouting "Ura." During Comrade Peng Zhen's speech, warm applause repeatedly rang out in the venue. After Comrade Peng Zhen finished speaking, the audience stood up again, and the applause lasted for a long time.

At the morning session on the 22nd, the heads of the brotherly party delegations from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Hungary also delivered speeches.

When Zhivkov, head of the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message at the congress, he praised the Romanian Workers' Party for being loyal to the proletarian cause, firmly opposing modern revisionism, and fighting to defend the purity of the invincible Marxist, Engels, and Lenin doctrines. He also heartily congratulated the Romanian people on the victories they have achieved in socialist construction and in the struggle for peace. Zhivkov said that we live in an era in which the ideas of socialism and communism are victorious throughout the world. He said that the strength of the socialist camp is constantly growing. No intimidation or provocation by the imperialists can frighten us. Our just cause – the cause of peace and socialism, the cause of communism – will surely win.

Novotny, head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, warmly congratulated the Romanian people on the achievements they have made. He said that a major factor in Czechoslovakia's rapid transition from capitalism to socialism is the international cooperation of the proletariat. In order to achieve common goals, it is necessary to support each other and strengthen the struggle for peace. The sabotage of the Paris summit proved that the forces of war have not learned their lesson.

Ulbricht, head of the German Socialist Unity Party delegation and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, pointed out in his congratulatory message that the fact that American imperialism violated Soviet airspace and sabotaged the Paris summit further proves the importance of maintaining peace. He said that countless facts prove that West Germany, especially West Berlin, is the center of imperialist sabotage activities. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to sign a peace treaty with Germany and eliminate the remnants of World War II.

Kádár, head of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, said in his congratulatory message that our people recognize and will never forget that our peaceful construction work is still threatened by American imperialism, which obstructs the peaceful resolution of disputes and attempts to take the violation of sovereignty as the norm of international relations. Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant and firmly oppose imperialist provocations.

He said that one of the most important tasks at present is to strengthen the friendship between the people of socialist countries. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will do its best to strengthen the unity of the international communist and workers' movement. In accordance with the Moscow Declaration, act jointly with the fraternal countries and fraternal parties.

At the afternoon meeting on the 22nd, Bodnaras, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, spoke. He said that since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, the glorious victories that Romania has been able to achieve in socialist construction should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party. Since the Second Party Congress, the party ranks have become stronger, and the leading role has been strengthened. The working people love and trust the party very much.

When talking about the achievements in culture and education, Bodnaras said that the task of achieving universal seven-year education by 1960, as proposed by the Second Party Congress, has now been completed. The labor of intellectuals should be encouraged in principle, and at the same time, efforts should be concentrated on training new types of intellectuals. Before the war, there were only about 9,000 engineers in Romania, while this year it will reach about 80,000. The social composition of students has also undergone fundamental changes. At present, 90% of the university students in the country are children of workers, laboring peasants, and people's intellectuals. He said that the party's policy of combining education with production is completely correct, and this is the goal of all cultural departments.

Bodnaras called on Romanian scientific, cultural, and artistic workers to complete the tasks on the ideological front put forward by the Third Congress of the Party, oppose national chauvinism, oppose modern revisionism, eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, and serve the working people.

Virgil, representative of Iasi State and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Labor Youth League, said in his speech that the Romanian Labor Youth League now has a total of 1.8 million members and 1.5 million Young Pioneers. The members of the Labor Youth League will unite more closely around the party and strive to complete the tasks set by the Third Congress of the Party.

    罗马尼亚工人党代表大会继续举行
    苏保捷德匈等国兄弟党代表团长致贺词
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会在21日和22日继续举行。
    据塔斯社报道：赫鲁晓夫21日在罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义国家政府在人民力量的压力下不得不同意政府首脑会议。但是，他们事先就把事情导向破坏这个会晤。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，在巴黎发生的事情不是偶然的现象，这是帝国主义的策略。“以美国侵略集团为首的帝国主义者过去和现在一直反对各国和平共处的政策。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，虽然巴黎会议被美国侵略集团破坏了，但是，那些成熟了的国际问题并不因此而消失。这些问题仍然迫待解决。赫鲁晓夫列举了这些问题：解决全面裁军问题，销毁进行战争的手段，解散各国的武装部队。赫鲁晓夫说：“应该消除第二次世界大战的残迹，同两个德国缔结和约，并在这个基础上解决西柏林问题。”他说，苏联和其他社会主义国家愿意现在就派代表来缔结全面裁军条约和对德和约。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国飞机的间谍性的侵犯向一切不希望战争的国家的人民表明了，不能陶醉于幻想，不能放松为争取和平而作的努力，不能相信执行帝国主义意志的人们的言词。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们不打算屈服于挑衅，也不打算放弃我国外交政策的总路线。这就是共处的政策，巩固和平的政策，缓和国际紧张局势和消除“冷战”的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫说，列宁提出的关于帝国主义的那些原理现在仍然有效，但是，这些原理中的某些内容所指的是还没有出现苏联和没有出现其他社会主义国家的时期。不能机械地重复列宁关于帝国主义战争是不可避免的话。在现代条件下，战争并不是不可以避免的。“谁若不懂得这一点，那他就是不相信工人阶级的力量和创造潜力，就低估了社会主义阵营的威力，就不相信社会主义的伟大的吸引力。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义者在现代条件下发动战争的可能性没有消除，但是，帝国主义不希望发动自取灭亡的战争。如果希特勒知道发动对苏战争的结果，他就不会发动那次战争。如果帝国主义者仍要发动战争，那么，社会主义阵营是有可能制止战争的。
    赫鲁晓夫把取消艾森豪威尔到日本的访问称作是给美国总统的一记“公开的耳光”。他说，美国军国主义分子在日本到处遍设旨在反对苏联和人民中国的军事基地，他们的政策是“国际紧张局势的基本根源之一”。
    赫鲁晓夫在发言中主张社会主义体系各国在发展经济方面，在它们之间的合理的劳动分工方面进行最密切的配合。他说，我想，今后我们将集体地解决发展社会主义世界体系的重要问题。只有密切的经济合作和政治合作，才能顺利地向社会主义和共产主义前进。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当苏联在强大的帝国主义国家阵营面前还是唯一的国家时，它就奉行了爱好和平的政策。当目前爱好和平的力量对战争和侵略的势力毫无疑问地占优势时，我们仍然奉行这种政策。
    在22日上午会议上，罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员、内务部长德勒吉奇发了言。他指出，自罗马尼亚工人党“二大”召开以来，罗马尼亚各个方面都发生了根本的变化，人民政权更加巩固了，全国人民更加紧密地团结在工人党的周围。
    德勒吉奇说，随着社会主义建设的发展，国家组织的任务愈来愈大，同违法现象作斗争的任务将逐步由社会组织——同志审判会来担当，但这绝不是说，要放松对坏分子、间谍的警惕。特别是现在，当美帝国主义宣布进行间谍活动是他们的国策时，就更需要提高警惕，警惕帝国主义间谍的破坏活动。他说，罗马尼亚内政部在对敌斗争中得到了广大群众的积极支持。修正主义分子削弱国家在社会主义建设中的作用的胡说，是企图使党失去最重要的工具。
    德勒吉奇说，社会主义国家对外的功能是保卫祖国。他说，只要帝国主义存在，就有侵略。
    在22日上午会议上发言的还有：“底密索拉州委第一书记伊·马丁、布加勒斯特市代表依·康斯坦丁、克罗什州代表伊·纳吉等。
    中国共产党代表团团长、中共中央政治局委员彭真在22日上午的会议上致了贺词，并宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺电，当彭真同志走上讲台时，全场起立，热烈地、长时间地鼓掌，高呼“乌拉”。在彭真同志讲话时，会场上不断响起热烈的掌声。彭真同志讲话结束后，全场再次起立，掌声经久不息。
    在22日上午会议上，保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和匈牙利兄弟党代表团团长也致了词。
    保加利亚共产党代表团团长、保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在大会上致贺词时对罗马尼亚工人党忠实于无产阶级事业、坚决反对现代修正主义和为保卫战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁学说的纯洁性而进行的斗争表示赞扬。他还衷心地祝贺罗马尼亚人民在社会主义建设和在争取和平的斗争中所取得的胜利。日夫科夫说，我们生活在社会主义和共产主义思想在全世界胜利的时代。他说，社会主义阵营的力量不断增长。帝国主义分子对我们的任何恐吓和挑衅都吓不倒我们。我们的正义事业——和平和社会主义事业，共产主义事业必将胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼致贺词时热烈祝贺罗马尼亚人民所取得的成就。他说，捷克斯洛伐克迅速地从资本主义向社会主义过渡的一个主要因素是无产阶级的国际合作。为了实现共同的目标，需要互相支援，加强争取和平的斗争。巴黎首脑会议遭到破坏一事证明了战争力量并没有接受教训。
    德国统一社会党代表团团长、德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希致贺词时指出，美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空和破坏巴黎首脑会谈这一事实更证明了维护和平的重要性。他说，无数事实证明，西德，特别是西柏林是帝国主义破坏活动的中心。因此，当前最迫切的任务是签订对德和约和消除第二次世界大战的残迹。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团团长、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央第一书记卡达尔致贺词说，我们的人民认识到，并且永不会忘记我们的和平建设工作还受着美帝国主义的威胁，美帝国主义阻挠和平解决争端问题，企图把对主权的侵犯作为国际关系的准则，因此，必需提高警惕，坚定地反对帝国主义的挑衅。
  他说，当前最重要的任务之一就是加强社会主义各国人民间的友谊。匈牙利社会主义工人党将竭尽全力加强国际共产主义和工人运动的团结。根据莫斯科宣言，同各兄弟国家和兄弟党共同行动。
    在22日下午的会议上，罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员波德纳拉希发了言。他说，自罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会以来，罗马尼亚在社会主义建设方面之所以能够取得辉煌的胜利，首先应当归功于罗马尼亚工人党的正确领导。第二次党代表大会以来，党的队伍更加壮大了，领导作用更加加强了。劳动人民非常热爱和信任党。
    波德纳拉希在谈到文化教育方面的成就时说，党的第二次代表大会提出的到1960年实现普及七年制教育的任务现在已经完成了。应当本着原则性鼓励知识分子的劳动，同时集中力量培养新型的知识分子。战前，罗马尼亚全国仅有约九千名工程师，而在今年将达到约八万名。学生的社会成份也起了根本的变化。目前，全国的大学生中，90％都是工人、劳动农民和人民知识分子的子弟。他说，党提出的教育与生产相结合的方针是完全正确的，这是所有文化部门的工作人员的奋斗目标。
    波德纳拉希号召罗马尼亚科学、文化和艺术工作者完成党的第三次代表大会提出的思想战线方面的任务，反对民族沙文主义，反对现代修正主义，清除资产阶级思想残余，为劳动人民服务。
    雅西州代表、罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟中央委员会第一书记维吉尔在发言中说，罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟现在共有一百八十万盟员、一百五十万少先队员。劳动青年联盟的盟员们将更加紧密地团结在党的周围，为完成党的第三次代表大会提出的任务而努力。（附图片）
