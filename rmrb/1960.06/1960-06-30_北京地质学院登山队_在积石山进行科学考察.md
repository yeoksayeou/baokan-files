Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 29th. After the Beijing Institute of Geology Mountaineering Team ascended the main peak of Jishi Mountain – Anyemaqen Peak – in Qinghai Province on June 2nd, they have preliminarily completed scientific exploration of an area of about 500 square kilometers in the eastern and northern parts of the highest peak area of Jishi Mountain – Maji Snow Mountain in the past half month. At present, they are sorting out the rich data collected at the base camp, which is 5,119 meters above sea level.

Anyemaqen Peak is 7,100 meters above sea level, and more than ten snow peaks above 6,000 meters above sea level stand around it, forming the magnificent Maji Snow Mountain. The mountains are covered with perennial snow and ice. The valleys below the mountains are deep and dangerous, and the rivers are turbulent. The climate in the mountainous area is changeable, and the terrain varies greatly in altitude, making passage extremely difficult. Historically, no one has ever reached the summit, so it is called a "geographical blank spot."

Encouraged by the Party's call to "march towards the high mountains and let the underground treasures and ice and snow resources of the high mountains serve the socialist construction of the motherland," the young Beijing Institute of Geology Mountaineering Team set high aspirations and was determined to explore the "mystery" of Jishi Mountain. They conducted scientific investigations and research along the way while entering the mountainous area and conquering the main peak. After conquering the main peak, they continued to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the geology, modern glaciers, landforms, topography, and meteorology of the mountainous area, regardless of fatigue.

They finally mapped in detail the altitude and topography of the main peak area of Jishi Mountain, studied the geological structure, climate and glacial change patterns there, and collected valuable scientific data on the meteorology and biological history of the area.

    北京地质学院登山队
    在积石山进行科学考察
    新华社西宁29日电　北京地质学院登山队在6月2日登上了青海省境内积石山主峰——阿尼玛卿峰以后，近半个多月来又初步完成了对积石山最高峰区——玛积雪山东部和北部面积约五百平方公里地区的科学考察工作。目前，他们正在拔海五千一百一十九米的大本营对所搜集的丰富资料进行整理工作。
    阿尼玛卿峰拔海七千一百米，在它的周围耸立着十多座拔海六千米以上的雪峰，形成了壮丽的玛积雪山。群山上冰雪常年不化。山下沟壑深险，河流湍急。山区气候变化无常，地势高低悬殊很大，通行极为困难。在历史上，从未有人登上过峰顶，因而被称为“地理上的空白点”。
    年青的北京地质学院登山队，在党的“向高山进军，让高山的地下宝藏和冰雪资源为祖国社会主义建设服务”的号召鼓舞下，树雄心，立大志，决心要探索积石山之“谜”。他们在进入山区和征服主峰的过程中，就沿路进行科学调查研究工作。在征服了主峰之后，他们又不顾疲劳，继续对山区的地质、现代冰川、地貌、地形和气象等展开了全面考察。
    他们终于详细地测绘了积石山主峰地区的山峰高度和地形，研究了那里的地质构造、气候和冰川变化的规律，并且搜集了这个地区的气象、生物历史等宝贵的科学资料。
