    Harvesters Must Undergo Rigorous Inspection Before Leaving the Factory
    During this year's wheat harvest, our commune purchased more than 100 Taigu-brand harvesters (imitations) from places like Xuzhou. After testing, the effect was very good. However, we found an imperfection: a small iron ring that pulls the chain frequently opens, causing the small outer wheel to constantly press down on the wheat stalks, affecting harvesting efficiency and quality.
    We believe this is mainly because some factories did not conduct thorough and meticulous inspections before the products left the factory. For example, regarding the chain, if its lead strips were changed to iron strips, steel strips, or belts, the above-mentioned problem could be avoided. Of course, the factory may have put in a lot of effort, such as using electric welding to prevent the chain from opening. But they didn't consider that when pulled by animal power, the pulling force is large, and the iron chain is still easy to open. We hope the relevant factories will pay attention to this.

### 收割机出厂要严加检查

    收割机出厂要严加检查
    在今年麦收当中，我们公社从徐州等地购进仿造的太谷号收割机一百多部，经试用效果很好，但发现美中不足的地方，是牵动链子的一个小铁圈经常开口，使得外边小圆轮总是压倒麦棵，影响收割工效和质量。
    我们认为这主要是有些工厂在产品出厂的时候，没有经过周密细致的检查。譬如牵动链子，如果把它的铅条改成铁条、钢条或皮带，是可以避免上述毛病的。当然，工厂也可能花费了不少脑力，如防止链子开口，使用了电焊。但没有估计到畜力拉动时，拉力大，铁链还是容易开口。希望有关工厂引起注意。
