Xinhua News Agency, May 30th - Indian Prime Minister Nehru has recently repeatedly expressed his opposition to condemning the party responsible for the breakdown of the Four-Power Summit Conference.

    On May 28th, at a press conference in Damascus, he said, "If we simply make accusations, perhaps there is reason to do so, but it may not necessarily be helpful." In this regard, he mentioned the joint statement he issued with United Arab Republic President Nasser in Cairo. He said, "We did not accuse anyone, but we expressed the hope that certain effective steps would be taken."

    Nehru expressed his pleasure at the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for negotiations among the four powers. It is known that this resolution, supported by the United States and its allies, only generally called on the four governments to hold negotiations but avoided mentioning the American spy plane intrusion into the Soviet Union and the need to stop such provocative actions.

    A reporter asked him if it would be appropriate for Nehru, Nasser, and Tito to meet to discuss the failure of the summit. Nehru said that there was no such suggestion. He expressed doubt as to whether it was necessary to hold any such meeting in the near future. However, he said, "Of course, we are in agreement to a very large extent." He said he had recently met with Nasser and was "keeping in touch" with Tito.

    Nehru also made similar remarks to reporters in Ankara on May 21st regarding the disruption of the Four-Power Summit Conference. He expressed hope that people would "forget all these past events." He said it was easy to point fingers or condemn this or that thing that had happened in the past two weeks, "but the question is, are we doing this to achieve something, or just to express an angry reaction to what happened?"

    尼赫鲁避不谴责美国罪行
    一再表示反对指责首脑会议破坏者
    新华社30日讯　印度总理尼赫鲁最近在谈到四国首脑会议破裂的问题时一再表示反对谴责应当对这种结果负责的一方。
    5月28日，他在大马士革举行的一次记者招待会上说，“如果我们一味指责，也许有理由，但是不一定有帮助。”在这方面，他谈到他同阿联总统纳赛尔在开罗发表的联合声明。他说，“我们没有指责任何人，但是我们表示希望采取某些有效的步骤。”
    尼赫鲁对于联合国安全理事会所通过的要求四国谈判的决议表示感到高兴。而人们知道，得到美国及其盟国支持的这项决议只是笼统地要求四国政府举行谈判但避而不提美国间谍飞机侵入苏联以及制止这种挑衅行动的必要性。
    有记者问他，如果尼赫鲁、纳赛尔和铁托举行会晤讨论最高级会议的失败问题是否适当。尼赫鲁说，并没有这样的建议。他表示怀疑是否有必要在最近的将来举行任何这样的会议。不过，他说，“当然，我们在非常大的程度上是一致的。”他说他最近同纳赛尔见了面，并且同铁托“保持着接触”。
    尼赫鲁本月21日在安卡拉对新闻记者谈到四国首脑会议被破坏的问题时，也发表了类似的意见。他表示希望人们“忘掉这一切过去的事情”。他说，对于过去两周中所发生的这件事情或那件事情加以指责或谴责是很容易的，“但是问题是，我们这样做是为了取得某种成就呢，还只是为了对发生的事件表示愤怒的反应”。
