The Intimate of Commune Members, A Good Cadre of the Party
Comrade Ye Yang Loves the Masses, Goes Deep into Reality, and Persists for Ten Years
The CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee Calls on Cadres Throughout the Province to Learn From Him

(By Our Correspondent) Ye Yang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shishui Brigade of the Diancheng Commune in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, has unremittingly adhered to eating, living, and laboring with the masses for ten years. He delves deeply into production and among the masses, completing various tasks outstandingly. He has been rated as a model cadre for ten consecutive years. The CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee called on all Party members and cadres to learn from Ye Yang's excellent qualities and work style.

Ye Yang has insisted on eating, living, and laboring with the masses for the ten years he has been working. The masses praised, "After Lao Ye became a cadre, he is still the same as our commune members, without any airs of a cadre." Besides attending meetings and studying, he spends most of his time with the masses, either working in the fields, serving as a cook in the canteen, or visiting commune members' homes. After the communization, although his responsibilities became heavier than before, he still insisted on participating in labor, and his work became even more in-depth day by day. Last year, he worked two hundred and twelve workdays, and from January to April this year, he worked sixty-one workdays. Through "Three Togethers" (eat together, live together, work together), he learned many situations and problems that were not easy to understand and quickly found ways to solve them. In April this year, when he was transplanting rice seedlings with the members of the Dalupo Production Team, he saw that the progress of transplanting was slow, and the members were always silent. Later, under Ye Yang's inspiration, the members revealed to him the problems existing in the canteen. To further understand the situation, he personally went to the canteen to work as a cook and listen to the opinions of the members. In this way, he quickly found out the problems existing in the canteen and immediately dealt with them, ensuring that the members were fed and well-fed. The morale of the members was immediately boosted, and the attendance rate reached 100%, quickly completing the task of transplanting rice seedlings. At a general branch committee meeting, someone reported that the reason for the backwardness of the Changpo Production Team was "old stubbornness" and "old conservatism." Ye Yang doubted this view. The next day, he carried his bedding and tools and settled down in this team, "laboring" with the poor and lower-middle peasants. He quickly learned that the reason for the backwardness of this team was the failure to implement the "three guarantees" (guaranteed output, guaranteed workdays, guaranteed costs) and the biased production quota. To solve this problem in a timely manner, Ye Yang held an on-site meeting on the "three guarantees" in this team, reasonably adjusting the "three guarantees" indicators for each production team. As a result, the masses' enthusiasm for production quickly rose.

Ye Yang insists on putting politics in command in his work, implementing the Party's policies, resolutely fighting against various unhealthy tendencies, and defending the socialist cause. In the spring of 1959, a gust of wind blowing towards disbanding the canteens suddenly arose, and seven wealthy middle peasants took the lead in withdrawing from the canteens. Some cadres within the Party were also affected. When the Party branch discussed the issue of running the canteens well, opinions differed. After listening to everyone's opinions, Ye Yang pointed out that not actively running the canteens was a manifestation of right-leaning thinking. He said, "Not actively leading the running of canteens well is a manifestation of not caring about the lives of the masses. Chairman Mao taught us that we must help solve the masses' firewood, rice, oil, and salt problems. After the communization, the burden of the masses' lives is entirely on our shoulders. We must not only grasp production but also grasp life. Doing a good job in life is precisely to promote production." He also said: "The canteen must not only be run, but it must also be run well, run to communism!" After the meeting, Ye Yang took the lead in going to the Shishui Production Team canteen to work as a cook, conduct experimental plots, and eat, live, work, and discuss with the members, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, building kitchens and restaurants, planting 25 mu of vegetables, raising 105 pigs, and expanding the canteen's assets. Then, he held an on-site meeting of all thirteen canteens in the brigade in this canteen to summarize and promote advanced experience, listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve the work of the canteen. As a result, all the canteens in this brigade were consolidated and became famous "six-good" model canteens in the county.

Ye Yang always sets an example in participating in labor and uses his own exemplary actions to influence and lead other cadres and members. One night in September last year, dark clouds suddenly covered the sky, thunder and lightning intertwined, and then heavy rain poured down. At this time, Ye Yang had a fever and was lying in bed. When he heard the sound of water flowing from Shipitou behind the brigade headquarters was a little different from usual, he got up and woke up the militiaman and said, "Shipitou may have been damaged by the heavy rain, hurry up and rescue it!" After speaking, he led more than a dozen members straight to Shipitou, only to see a gap opened in the weir. At this time, Ye Yang jumped into the waist-deep water without hesitation and used his sick body to hold the gap. His noble quality of selflessness deeply moved the masses, and members jumped down one after another to block the gap with wooden stakes and stones. In January this year, when the clearing project of the Daqiao River aqueduct was under intense construction, the water was deep and cold, and people were unwilling to go down. To release water for spring plowing as soon as possible, Ye Yang first took off his cotton coat, plunged into the water, and took the lead, and seventeen Communist Party members insisted on the clearing work. Because the water was deep and the current was swift, member Chen Yaqin was swept away by the rapids, and the people on the shore were very anxious. Ye Yang thought: How can I be considered a Communist Party member if I don't save someone who is dying. He used all his strength, sank to the bottom of the river, and searched east and west before saving Chen Yaqin. His style of selflessness educated the cadres and moved the masses. Everyone expressed their determination to complete this project ahead of schedule.

Ye Yang's concern for the members is even more meticulous. He regards the members' difficulties as his own and tries his best to help solve them. In February this year, Ye Ruxun, an 80-year-old member of Shishui Village, suddenly fell seriously ill, and no one in his family took care of him. No matter how busy Ye Yang was with his work, he always went to take care of him twice every morning and evening, asking doctors, buying vegetables, delivering meals, and helping him pour excrement and urine. Recently, the wife of Chen Yaqin, a poor member of the Dalupo Production Team, gave birth to a child. Because her husband was not at home, life was a bit difficult, and the newborn child had not prepared clothes yet. Ye Yang bought six feet of cloth and sent it to her. Ye Yang cares about the masses, and the masses also care about him. In November last year, he fell ill due to overwork, and many members went to visit him, and some also brought white sugar, eggs, and pork to express their condolences.

Ye Yang cherishes public property very much, is diligent and thrifty, and never spends a penny of public money indiscriminately. The members all said: "Lao Ye is our best housekeeper." In the past two years, many people have advised Ye Yang to buy a bicycle. However, he always said, "We are running in the fields to engage in production, and bicycles are not very useful. It is better to use the money for production." This spring, some cadres saw that other brigades had built new offices and suggested that he build a new house for office work. Ye Yang not only disagreed but also gave part of a ancestral hall where the brigade was working for a nursery and part for a warehouse. Under his initiative, the thousands of yuan that the brigade had saved in the past two years were all used for production and to run mass collective welfare undertakings. He also often taught the Party members of the branch, "Communist Party members should become examples of diligence and thrift."

    社员的知心人　党的好干部
    叶养同志热爱群众，深入实际，十年如一日
    中共广东省委号召全省干部向他学习
    本报讯　广东电白县电城公社湿水大队党总支部书记叶养，十年如一日坚持不懈地与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，深入生产，深入群众，出色地完成了各项工作任务，连续十年都被评为模范干部。中共广东省委号召全体党员和干部学习叶养的优良品质和工作作风。
    叶养参加工作十年来，一直坚持与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。群众赞扬说：“老叶当干部后，还是和我们社员一样，没有半点干部架子。”他除了参加开会、学习外，大部分时间都和群众在一起，不是在田间劳动，就是在食堂当炊事员，或去社员家里访问。公社化后，他的担子虽然比以前更重了，可是他仍然坚持参加劳动，而且工作还一天比一天更为深入。去年一年，他做了二百一十二个劳动日，今年1月至4月，就做了六十一个劳动日。通过“三同”，他了解到许多不易了解到的情况和问题，并迅速想办法加以解决。今年4月，他和大路坡生产队社员一起插秧时，看见插秧进度很慢，社员老是沉闷不说话。后来，在叶养的启发下，社员向他揭发了食堂存在的问题。为了进一步摸清情况，他又亲自到这个食堂当炊事员，倾听社员意见。这样，很快就查出食堂存在的问题，并立即作了处理，保证社员吃饱吃好。社员情绪顿时高涨，出勤率达到100％，很快便完成了插秧任务。在一次总支委员会议上，有人反映长坡生产队落后的原因是“老顽固”、“老保守”。叶养对这个看法有怀疑，第二天他背着铺盖，挑着工具，到这个队安家落户，和贫农下中农一起“劳动”，很快便了解到这个队落后的原因，是“三包”不落实，包产指标偏高等。为了及时解决这个问题，叶养在这个队召开“三包”现场会议，合理调整各个生产队的“三包”指标。结果，群众生产情绪便迅速高涨起来。
    叶养在工作中坚持政治挂帅，贯彻执行党的方针政策，坚决与各种歪风邪气作斗争，捍卫社会主义事业。1959年春天，突然刮来一股散食堂的歪风，有七户富裕中农带头退出了食堂。党内一些干部也受到影响。党总支讨论关于办好食堂的问题时，意见分歧。叶养听取了大家的意见以后，指出不积极办食堂是思想右倾的表现。他说：“不积极领导办好食堂，是不关心群众生活的表现，毛主席教导我们，群众的柴、米、油、盐都要帮助解决。公社化后，群众的生活担子全在我们肩上，既要抓好生产，又要抓好生活，搞好生活正是为了促进生产。”又说：
  “食堂不但要办，而且要办好，办到共产主义！”开完会以后，叶养便带头到湿水生产小队食堂去当炊事员，搞试验田，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，依靠贫农、下中农，盖起厨房餐厅，种蔬菜二十五亩，养猪一百零五头，扩大食堂的家底。接着，在这个食堂召开全大队十三个食堂的现场会议，总结推广先进经验，倾听群众意见，改进食堂工作。结果，这个大队的食堂全部巩固下来，成为全县有名的“六好”标兵食堂。
    叶养在参加劳动中，总是以身作则，用自己的模范行动来影响和带动其他干部和社员。去年9月的一个夜晚，突然黑云密布，雷电交加，接着下了倾盆大雨。这时，叶养身体发热，躺在床上。当他听到大队部后边石陂头的流水声和往常有点不同，就爬起床去叫醒民兵说：“石陂头可能被大雨冲坏了，赶快去抢救！”说完，他带领十多个社员一口气直奔向石陂头，只见陂头被冲开一个缺口。这时，叶养毫不犹豫地跳下齐人深的水里去，用自己带病的身体顶住缺口。他这种舍己为人的高贵品质深深感动了群众，社员一个接着一个争先恐后地跳下去，用木桩、石块堵塞缺口。今年1月，大桥河渡槽的清基工程紧张施工的时候，水深又冷，人们不愿下去。为了提早放水春耕，叶养首先脱下棉衣，扑通一声带头下水，和十七个共产党员坚持清基工作。由于水深流急，社员陈亚钦被急流冲走了，岸上的人们都十分焦急。叶养想：见死不救，怎能算个共产党员。他使尽力量，沉下河底，东摸西找，才把陈亚钦救上来。他这种舍己为人的风格教育了干部，感动了群众，大家纷纷表示决心，提早完成这项工程。
    叶养关心社员更是无微不至。他把社员的困难看作是自己的困难，尽力帮助解决。今年2月，湿水村八十岁的老社员叶汝训，突然患了重病，家里没有人料理。叶养不管工作怎样忙，总是每天早晚两次前去照料，请医生、买菜、送饭、帮助倒屎倒尿。最近，大路坡生产队贫农社员陈亚钦的老婆生了一个孩子，因为丈夫不在家，生活有点困难，刚出世的小孩还没有准备好衣服。叶养便买了六尺布送给她。叶养关心群众，群众也关心他。去年11月，他由于劳累过度发了病，许多社员都去探望他，有的还拿白糖、鸡蛋、猪肉前去慰问。
    叶养对公共财产十分爱惜，勤勤俭俭，从不乱花公家一文钱。社员都说：“老叶是我们最好的当家人。”近两年来，许多人曾劝叶养买架自行车。可是，他总是这么说：“我们是跑田垌闹生产的，自行车用处不大，不如把钱用到生产上去。”今春，有的干部看到别的大队新建办公室，向他提议建座新房子办公。叶养不但不同意，反而把大队办公的一个祠堂让出一部分做托儿所、一部分做仓库。在他倡议下，还把两年来大队节约下来的几千元，全部用到生产上和举办群众集体福利事业。他还常常教导支部的党员说：“共产党员要成为勤俭朴素的榜样”。
