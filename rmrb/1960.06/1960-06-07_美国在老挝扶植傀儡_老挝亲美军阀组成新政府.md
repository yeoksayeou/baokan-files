Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd June: Vientiane Dispatch: The People's Social Party, organized by pro-American warlord elements in Laos, formed a new government today.

Zhao Songsanit, Vice Chairman of the People's Social Party, serves as the Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of the new government. Phoumi Nosavan, Chairman of the People's Social Party, serves as the Minister of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Sports, and Youth. Another Vice Chairman of the party, Kampan Panya, serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Zhao Songsanit, the new Prime Minister, was appointed to form the cabinet on May 31st. Prior to this, the "Interim Government" headed by Kou Abhay, which came to power after a military coup launched by pro-American warlord elements, had already submitted its resignation to the King on May 30th.

The Lao Patriotic Front's organ, "Lao Patriotic News," revealed in a commentary on May 25th that Zhao Songsanit was regarded by U.S. imperialism and its number one agent in Laos, Phoumi Nosavan, as a more suitable candidate to form the cabinet at present.

The commentary pointed out that he was a defector from the "Lao People's Union Party." After the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" gained power with U.S. support, he joined this organization. Under U.S. instruction, he formed the Lao People's Social Party with Phoumi Nosavan, serving as the Vice Chairman of this party, preparing to use this new party as a tool to seize a majority of seats in the National Assembly and form a new government.
Iraq’s “Voice of Free Men” and Czechoslovakia’s “People’s Defense” Comment on Anti-Imperialist Struggle: Resolute and Forceful Attitude is Needed to Deal with US Imperialism; Peace Cannot be Maintained at the Cost of Concessions
Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 2nd: Iraq's "Voice of Free Men" published an editorial today on the issue of safeguarding world peace, pointing out that a resolute and forceful attitude towards U.S. imperialism is the only way to stop the U.S. warmongers from continuing to do "stupid things."

The editorial pointed out that despite widespread condemnation of U.S. provocative acts, U.S. officials shamelessly announced that the U.S. will continue to implement its espionage policies, which poses a great danger to world peace and security.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. has not learned its lesson from the incident of its spy plane being shot down in the Soviet Union and continues to send planes to fly over Soviet ships. The editorial said that the danger posed by U.S. planes is not limited to the territory of the Soviet Union and Soviet ships, because U.S. planes are stationed in many places of U.S. "allies."

The editorial also said that Arab countries are one of the regions constantly directly subjected to U.S. aircraft intrusions. When talking about the danger of U.S. aircraft arbitrarily flying over the airspace of Arab countries, the editorial said that aircraft may crash, and therefore disaster may occur.

The editorial emphasized that the U.S.'s actions have repeatedly proved that it does not respect the will and wishes of the people of all countries. There is no other way to force it away from the brink of war except by dealing with it with a firm and forceful attitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 1st: Czechoslovakia's "People's Defense" pointed out in an article today that the U.S. spy plane's aggressive actions against the Soviet Union are an integral part of the aggressive policy of the U.S. militarist clique, including Eisenhower.

The article, entitled "Peace Cannot Be Maintained at the Cost of Concessions," exposed and refuted the fallacy of some Westerners and Yugoslav revisionists that the Soviet government does not need to draw major conclusions from these "small matters" of U.S. planes violating Soviet borders.

The article said: The U.S. spy plane's aggressive actions against the Soviet Union are neither accidental nor isolated phenomena, but an integral part of the premeditated aggressive policy of the U.S. militarist clique, including Eisenhower.

The article also refuted the claim that Soviet Premier Khrushchev's position in Paris was "too harsh" and that he should have held negotiations with Western countries even under unequal conditions. The article said that these erroneous views stem from the petty bourgeoisie and pacifist understanding of the struggle for peace. "Concessions to the bourgeoisie on issues of ideology, national sovereignty, and national freedom are unacceptable to Communists."

The article said that peace cannot be prevented at the cost of making concessions to aggressors. Only an uncompromising and serious stance can sober up hot-headed aggressors.

The article emphasized that imperialism's aggressive stance towards socialist countries has been irrefutably exposed. For the cause of peace, unprincipled and secret diplomatic talks that cover up war preparations are even more dangerous. Imperialists must understand that power diplomacy cannot be used on the issues of peace and war.

    美国在老挝扶植傀儡
    老挝亲美军阀组成新政府
    据新华社河内2日电　万象消息：老挝亲美军阀分子组织的人民社会党今天组成了老挝新政府。
    人民社会党的副主席昭·松萨尼特担任新政府的首相兼内政大臣，人民社会党主席富米·诺萨万担任国防、退伍军人、体育和青年大臣，这个党的另一个副主席坎番·班雅担任外交大臣。
    担任新首相的昭·松萨尼特是在5月31日受命组阁的。在这以前，在亲美军阀分子发动军事政变后上台的，以库·阿贝为首的“临时政府”，已经在5月30日向国王提出辞职。
    老挝爱国战线党机关报“老挝爱国新闻”5月25日在一篇评论中就已经揭露，昭·松萨尼特被美帝国主义和它在老挝的头号代理人富米·诺萨万视为目前出来组阁的较适合的人选。
    评论指出，他是“老挝人联合党”的叛党分子，在“保卫国家利益委员会”受美国扶持而得势之后，投靠了这个组织，并在美国授意下同富米·诺萨万组成了老挝人民社会党，担任了这个党的副主席，准备利用这个新党来作为夺取国会多数席位和成立新政府的工具。对付美帝国主义必须坚定有力以让步作为代价不能保持和平伊拉克“自由人之声报”和捷“人民防线报”评反帝斗争
    新华社巴格达2日电　伊拉克“自由人之声报”今天就保卫世界和平的问题发表社论指出，以坚定有力的态度对待美帝国主义，是唯一能够阻止美国黩武主义者继续干“蠢事”的办法。
    社论指出，尽管美国的挑衅行为遭到了普遍的谴责，但是美国的官员们仍然厚颜无耻地宣布，美国将继续执行间谍政策，这就使世界和平与安全遭到巨大的危险。
    社论指出，美国并没有从它的间谍飞机在苏联被击落的事件中吸取教训，仍在继续派遣飞机到苏联的船只上空飞行。社论说，美国飞机所造成的危险不仅仅限于对苏联的领土和苏联的船只，因为美国飞机驻扎在美国“盟国”的许多地方。
    社论还说，阿拉伯国家是不断直接受到美国飞机入侵的地区之一。社论在谈到美国飞机任意飞临阿拉伯国家领空的危险性时说，飞机可能失事，因此灾难可能发生。
    社论强调指出，美国的行动反复证明了它是不尊重各国人民的意志和愿望的。除了以坚定有力的态度来对待它以外，没有别的办法可以迫使它离开战争边缘。
    新华社布拉格1日电　捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”今天在一篇文章中指出，美国间谍飞机对苏联的侵略行动，是包括艾森豪威尔在内的美国军国主义集团的侵略政策的一个组成部分。
    这篇题为“以让步为代价不能保持和平”的文章，揭露并驳斥了某些西方人士以及南斯拉夫修正主义者的这种谬论：即苏联政府对于美国飞机侵犯苏联国境这些“小事情”不必做出重大的结论。
    文章说：美国间谍飞机对苏联的侵略行动既不是偶然的现象，也不是孤立的现象，而是包括艾森豪威尔在内的美国军国主义集团的处心积虑的侵略政策的一个组成部分。
    文章还驳斥了所谓苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎所持的立场“太严厉了”以及在不平等的条件下他也应当同西方国家举行谈判的说法。文章说，这些错误的观点是出自于小资产阶级与和平主义对争取和平斗争的理解。“在思想意识、国家主权和民族自由问题上向资产阶级让步是共产党人所不能接受的。”
    文章说，以向侵略者让步为代价是不能防止战争的，只有不妥协的、严肃的立场才能使头脑发热的侵略者清醒过来。
    文章强调指出，帝国主义对社会主义国家的侵略立场已经无可辩驳地暴露无遗。对于和平事业来说，替准备战争打掩护的无原则的、秘密外交会谈更为危险，帝国主义者必须了解，在和平和战争的问题上，不能使用强权外交。
