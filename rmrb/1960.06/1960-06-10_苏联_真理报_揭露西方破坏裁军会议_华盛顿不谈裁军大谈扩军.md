Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. The "Pravda" today pointed out in a Geneva dispatch that the West still adopted a delaying and sabotaging position at the ten-nation disarmament committee meeting that resumed on the 7th.

The American representative, Eaton, said at a press conference that the Western representatives should first study the current situation. He said that the Soviet proposal required a long time to study, and he suggested that while the Western delegation was "studying" the Soviet proposal, the ten-nation committee might as well do something else.

The dispatch said: The position of the American representative is not difficult to understand. Washington is now not talking about disarmament, but about expanding armaments. Before the ten-nation committee meeting, the United States released news that some people were demanding an increase of two to three billion dollars in the new military budget. This news, published just before the resumption of the meeting, is another provocation by the supporters of the Cold War.

The commentary also mentioned that some Western newspapers give the impression that the West wants to submerge the disarmament issue with long and fruitless discussions.

For example, the British "Guardian" and the French "Figaro" have both quoted opinions from Western authoritative diplomatic circles, suggesting that the fundamental solution to the problem should be put aside, and that some technical research should be carried out on the possibility of prohibiting and destroying nuclear weapons carriers. Other Western newspapers believe that it is necessary to completely avoid discussing the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and instead formulate some so-called "partial measures," including the American "Open Skies Plan" for conducting espionage activities on an international scale.

The dispatch said: But the Western newspapers have to admit that it is difficult to avoid discussing the Soviet proposal without exposing themselves as opponents of disarmament.

    苏联“真理报”揭露西方破坏裁军会议
    华盛顿不谈裁军大谈扩军
    新华社莫斯科8日电　“真理报”今天在一篇日内瓦通讯中指出，西方在7日复会的十国裁军委员会会议上仍然采取拖延和破坏立场。
    美国代表伊顿在记者招待会上说，西方代表首先要研究当前的情况，他说，苏联提案需要很长时间的研究，他建议当西方代表团“研究”苏联提案时，十国委员会不妨干点别的事情。
    通讯说：美国代表的立场是不难了解的。华盛顿现在不是在谈论裁军，而是在谈论扩军。在十国委员会开会以前美国发表了有人要求增加新军事预算二十到三十亿美元的消息。这种刚好在复会前夕公布的消息正是冷战拥护者的又一次挑衅。
    评论还谈到，一些西方报刊给人的印象是，西方想用长期的、毫无成果的讨论来淹没裁军问题。
    例如：英国的“卫报”和法国的“费加罗报”都曾经引用西方权威外交界人士的意见，建议把从根本原则上解决问题放在一边，而从事一些关于禁止和销毁核武器载运工具的可能性的技术性研究。另外一些西方报刊认为必须完全回避讨论全面彻底裁军提案，而去制订一些所谓“局部措施”，其中包括美国的在国际范围内进行间谍活动的“开放天空计划”。
    通讯说：但是西方报刊不得不承认，要想回避讨论苏联的提案，而又不暴露自己是裁军的反对者是困难的。
