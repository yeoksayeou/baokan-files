Going Among the Masses to Solve Cadre Ideological Problems; Going into the Workshops to Solve Key Production Problems
Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant Achieves Immediate Results with On-site Rectification

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, June 13th) The Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant, in its all-out effort in June, had leading cadres go deep into the front lines of production, mobilized the masses to vigorously tackle key production issues, and achieved remarkable results.

After the great technical revolution, the plant's capacity to manufacture new passenger cars increased from one every few days to one per day; the capacity to manufacture new freight cars increased from six to fifteen per day. However, the workshop's capacity to cast passenger car parts was only enough to complete one car every two days, and its capacity to cast freight car parts was only five cars per day; steel production was even more unable to keep up with demand. In this situation, steelmaking and casting became the "bottleneck" restricting the plant's substantial increase in production. To quickly break through this weak link, the plant's Party committee believed that it was necessary to start with further improving the leadership's work style, going deep into production, mobilizing the masses, and vigorously tackling key issues.

At the beginning of June, the plant's Party committee convened an enlarged Party committee meeting in the steelmaking workshop, attended by responsible cadres from various departments and workshops and worker representatives, to conduct "on-site rectification." At the meeting, plant-level leading cadres expressed their willingness to humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses. At the same time, they firmly expressed their determination to overcome this weak link. The Party committee's determination to solve the problem greatly encouraged the masses. They said, "If the leaders can go into the sea, we can capture the dragon." Before the Party committee secretary had finished his mobilization report, the workers were already vying to speak. In just over three hours, they fully exposed the reasons for the workshop's backwardness. It turned out that the main cadres in the workshop had a sense of complacency in their thinking, and their leadership style was not thorough enough. After the criticisms and revelations from the masses, the Party committee immediately studied a plan to correct the shortcomings. On the one hand, it required the steelmaking workshop and relevant departments to quickly rectify the current production-related problems. On the other hand, it organized a working group led by Deputy Party Committee Secretary Fang Fusheng, with responsible cadres from relevant departments such as metallurgy, labor wages, materials, and inspection participating, to go deep into the workshop, both to work alongside the workers and to help solve problems.

On the evening of the enlarged meeting, the steelmaking workshop convened an enlarged branch committee meeting to study improvement measures based on the problems revealed at the meeting. First, the labor organization was adjusted according to the needs of production along two lines: steelmaking and casting. Cadres were further assigned tasks, clarified their responsibilities, and participated in work shifts. With the help of relevant departments, systems for quota management, production management, and quality inspection were re-established. Materials scattered everywhere were also sorted and concentrated by type, and designated personnel were assigned to manage them, establishing a registration system for incoming and outgoing materials. With the leaders' determination and the workers' increased enthusiasm, red flag competitions were launched between shifts, with daily evaluations and inspections, and a heated atmosphere of learning and promoting advanced experiences was formed. In the past, when casting molds, the lack of tung oil on the iron molds and technical problems in cleaning and shoveling had not been resolved for two consecutive months, resulting in a lot of scrap steel; recently, with the help of technical personnel from the metallurgy department, workers used asphalt and water glass to replace tung oil, eliminating scrap steel within a week. At the same time, due to the promotion of advanced experience, casting capacity has also been greatly improved. In the past, it took three days to cast one 608 car bogie; now it can cast four per day. Steel production has also risen sharply. From the 1st to the 8th, steel production completed more than 800 tons, an increase of 1.4 times compared to the same period last month. (Attached picture)

### 到群众中去解决干部思想问题　到车间里去解决生产关键问题  浦镇车辆厂现场整改立见功效

    到群众中去解决干部思想问题　到车间里去解决生产关键问题
    浦镇车辆厂现场整改立见功效
    本报南京13日电　南京浦镇车辆工厂在大战六月中，领导干部深入生产前线，发动群众猛攻生产关键，取得显著成果。
    大闹技术革命以后，这个厂新造客车的能力由几天一辆增加到一天一辆；新造货车的能力，由一天六辆增加到十五辆。而这个车间铸造客车配件的能力，两天才能完成一辆，铸造货车的能力一天只能作五辆；钢的生产更是跟不上需要。在这样的情况下，炼钢和铸造就成了这个厂大幅度增产的“狭窄地带了”。为了迅速突破这个薄弱环节，工厂党委认为必须从进一步改进领导作风着手，深入生产，发动群众，猛攻关键。
    6月初，厂党委在炼钢车间召开了由各科室车间负责干部和工人代表参加的党委扩大会议，进行“现场整风”。会上厂级领导干部表示要虚心地听取群众的批评。同时也坚定地表示了攻下这个薄弱环节的决心。党委解决问题的决心给群众很大鼓舞。他们说：“领导能下海，我们就能擒龙。”党委书记的动员报告还没作完，工人们就抢着发言。在短短的三个多小时内，就把这个车间所以落后的原因全盘暴露出来了。原来这个车间的主要干部思想上有自满情绪，领导作风也不深入。经过群众的批评揭发，党委立即研究了改正缺点的方案。一方面要求炼钢车间和有关科室抓住当前生产有关的问题迅速整改，一方面由党委副书记方福生挂帅，组织了有冶金、劳动工资、材料、检验等有关科室负责干部参加的工作组，深入车间，一面跟班劳动，一面帮助解决问题。
    在扩大会议的当晚，炼钢车间就召开了总支扩大会议，根据会上揭露的问题，研究改进意见。首先根据生产需要按炼钢和铸造两条线调整了劳动组织；干部进一步作了分工，明确职责，并分班参加劳动。在有关科室的帮助下，重新建立定额管理、计划管理和质量检验等制度；散堆在四处的材料也按品种分段集中起来，指定专人保管，建立了来料、领料的登记制度。领导决心大，工人干劲增，班与班之间开展了红旗竞赛，日日评比、天天检查，学习和推广先进经验形成热潮。过去浇铸造型时，由于铁模上缺乏桐油，清铲技术问题一连两个月没有解决，废钢很多；最近在冶金科技术人员的帮助下，工人用沥青和水玻璃代替桐油，一个星期内就消灭了废钢。同时，由于先进经验的推广，浇铸能力也大大提高了。过去铸造六○八车厢转向架时，三天只要浇一台；现在一天就能浇四台。钢的产量也直线上升。1到8日，钢产量完成了八百多吨，比上月同期增长了一点四倍。（附图片）
