Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company gathered today to warmly welcome the Japanese Literary Delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma.

    Wang Dewang, vice chairman of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's trade union, spoke on behalf of all the workers at the meeting. He said that we Chinese workers have suffered from the aggression and oppression of Japanese militarism and American imperialism, and we have vivid memories of the atrocities of American imperialism and Japanese militarism. We deeply realize that American imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi, are the common enemies of the Chinese and Japanese people. We regard the struggle of the Japanese people as our own struggle, and every victory of the Japanese people as our own victory.

    Hiroshi Noma, the head of the delegation, then spoke at the meeting, introducing the struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan reactionaries and expressing his gratitude for the support of the Chinese people. He said that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States cannot be stopped by any force. He expressed his firm belief that the nationwide general strike to be launched by the Japanese people on the 15th will achieve even greater victories than the "June 4th" strike. His speech was met with warm applause from the workers.

    Japanese Literary Delegation members Katsuiro Kamei, Yoko Matsuoka, Kenzaburo Oe, and Minoru Takeuchi also spoke at the meeting. They expressed their gratitude for the support of the Chinese people and shouted slogans such as "The Chinese and Japanese people unite to overthrow our common enemy, American imperialism!"

    石钢工人集会欢迎日本文学家代表团
    据新华社13日讯　石景山钢铁公司职工今天集会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团。
    石景山钢铁公司工会副主席王德望代表全体职工在会上讲话。他说，我们中国工人曾经遭受过日本军国主义和美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，对美帝国主义和日本军国主义的暴行记忆犹新。我们深深体会到美帝国主义和它的走狗岸信介是中日两国人民共同的敌人。我们把日本人民的斗争看成是我们自己的斗争，把日本人民的每一个胜利也看成是我们的胜利。
    代表团团长野间宏接着在会上讲话，他介绍了日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争情况，并对中国人民的支持表示感激。他说，日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争是任何力量阻挡不住的。他表示坚信，日本人民将在15日开始举行的全国大罢工，一定会比“六四”罢工取得更大的胜利。他的讲话获得职工们一阵阵的热烈鼓掌。
    日本文学家代表团团员龟井胜一郎、松冈洋子、大江健三郎和竹内实也在会上讲了话，他们表示感谢中国人民的支持，并高呼“中日两国人民团结起来打倒共同敌人美帝国主义”等口号。
