    "Happiness Bridge" - A Song of a City People's Commune
    Liu Yong, Secretary of the Communist Party of China Beijing Chunshu People's Commune Committee
    The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Drama Troupe's new work, "Happiness Bridge," has premiered. This is a triumphal song of the birth and growth of a city people's commune, a good play worth recommending to everyone. One Sunday evening, more than a hundred of our Chunshu People's Commune members had the opportunity to see its performance. We were very excited that the comrades of the drama troupe were able to collect materials, write, rehearse, and perform such a good play in just over twenty days. The comrades of the drama troupe had just returned from the front lines in Fujian, and immediately came to our Chunshu People's Commune, going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and deep into life, working with the commune members, establishing close relationships with the masses, and feeling the tremendous changes in the city streets under the shining light of the Party's General Line, and the passionate and high-spirited spirit of the vast residents - the majority of whom are housewives - under the leadership of the Party. They felt the soaring enthusiasm for large-scale production and collective welfare. "When the melon is ripe, it falls off the vine, and when the water comes, the canal is formed." Therefore, they were able to create such a good work and a successful performance in such a short time.
    When the curtain on the stage opened, we were immediately drawn into a typical Beijing courtyard. How familiar we are with every character and every event that happens here! Aren't these the things we have experienced around us? The play takes us back to 1958, the great and extraordinary year. The wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao made our motherland develop by leaps and bounds. The General Line was announced, and the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward sounded. The streets were boiling. Today a group of women entered the factory, and tomorrow another group of women became salespersons. Everyone's heart also flew out. The broad masses of housewives walked out of their homes, following the direction pointed out by the Party, and strode forward on the road to complete liberation. A surging production upsurge was set off in the streets. The drama "Happiness Bridge" depicts and reflects this huge change in the streets. How familiar we are with Zheng Xiuyun, Grandpa Hao, Sister-in-law Cui, and Jin Yuzhi in the play! Aren't they all our commune members? Under the inspiration of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, they broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and made the ambitious goal of "adding bricks and tiles to socialism." Under the leadership of the Party, they worked hard and started from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large, and batches of factories were established. The facts refuted right-leaning conservative ideas, as Grandma Xu in the play said: "I have never heard of a daughter-in-law being able to run a factory. Do you still want to go to heaven?" Yes, things that had never been heard of in the past are now being done by liberated women, and they are doing a great job. They want to create a communist paradise with their own hands. Like the lively Communist Youth League member Zheng Xiuyun in the play, the image of the vast women and thousands of Communist Youth League members, they listened to the Party, and they were full of energy. The Party called for the establishment of factories. They were not intimidated by the difficulties of not having factory buildings, tools, or technical knowledge; sarcasm and ridicule could not shake them. They said, "With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the factory can be built." Starting with a bicycle pump, production was started. Like Cui Dajie, a simple working woman, the old society took away her relatives and suffered a lot; in the new society, the Party gave her new strength and a happy life. Look, how young she has become, how much she loves life, takes the revolution as her own cause, and takes the factory as her own home. When some people wavered and withdrew from the factory, she, together with Zheng Xiuyun and Jin Yuzhi, resolutely continued to run the factory; when she was about to get married, she was still concentrating on experimenting with technological innovation machines.
    Of course, in the process of the birth and growth of the People's Commune, the struggle between two roads—the socialist road and the capitalist road—has always been running through. When the small business owner Master Zhao refused to accept a batch of glass instruments urgently needed by the rural Wannianqing People's Commune to build a fertilizer plant in order to pursue profits, Zheng Xiuyun and Jin Yuzhi seriously criticized this idea of ​​making money and taking the capitalist road, and insisted on the policy of serving large factories, people's lives, and agriculture in street industry. With the great development of street production, it is necessary to further develop collective life and welfare undertakings so that the broad masses of housewives can get rid of the burden of housework; when everyone heard that Jin Yuzhi put her child in the rice jar, how urgently they needed to solve the child problem! The Party helped them in a timely manner. Secretary Zhou came here, and nurseries, kindergartens, service stations, and canteens for thousands of people were all set up. They smiled happily. Grandma Xu became the director of the nursery, and Yu Feng, who was afraid of getting dirty and tired, changed and became a waiter. The lofty qualities of the Communist Party members, retired worker Grandpa Hao, who was busy and hardworking everywhere, and his loyalty to the Party and the socialist cause, and his enthusiasm for serving the people, are all so familiar and kind to us. This is a true portrayal of the tremendous changes in the lives and mental outlook of thousands of housewives under the cultivation and education of the Party.
    This play is well written and the performance is also very successful. It truly reflects the great changes in the mental outlook of the city streets and the broad masses of women in the past year or so under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a song of the city people's commune. (Attached picture)

    “幸福桥”——一支城市人民公社的颂歌
    中共北京市椿树人民公社委员会书记　刘涌
    解放军总政文工团话剧团的新作“幸福桥”公演了。这是一支城市人民公社孕育、成长的凯歌，是一出值得向大家推荐的好戏。一个星期天的晚上，我们椿树人民公社一百多社员有机会看到它的演出，对于话剧团的同志能够在短短的二十多天中，从搜集材料、编剧、排练直到演出这样好的戏来，使我们感到非常兴奋。话剧团的同志刚刚从福建前线归来，立刻就又风尘仆仆地来到我们椿树人民公社，深入实际，深入群众，深入生活，和社员一起劳动，和群众建立亲切的感情，感受到了城市街道在党的总路线光辉照耀下的巨大变化，感受到了广大居民——绝大多数是家庭妇女，在党的领导下热情奔放，意气风发。大搞生产，大办集体生活福利的冲天干劲。“瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”，所以，他们能够在短短的时间内创作出这样好的作品和成功的演出。
    舞台上的幕布拉开了，我们立刻被吸引到一个北京的典型大杂院，这里的每一个人物，发生的每一件事情，我们是多么熟悉呀，这些不都是在我们身边经历过的事情么！戏把我们带到了1958年这个伟大的不平凡的一年，党和毛主席的英明领导使我们的祖国一日千里地向前发展。总路线公布了，大跃进的号角响起了，街道上沸腾了，今天一批妇女进了工厂，明天又有一批妇女当了售货员，大伙的心也跟着飞出来了。广大家庭妇女走出家门，按照党指出的方向，在彻底解放的道路上大踏步前进。一个汹涌澎湃的生产高潮，在街道上掀起了。话剧“幸福桥”描写和反映了街道上的这个巨大变化。剧中的郑秀云、郝大爷、崔大嫂、金玉芝，这些人我们是多么熟悉呀！他们不都是我们的社员么？在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，立下了“为社会主义添砖添瓦”的雄心大志，在党的领导下穷干苦干白手起家，从无到有，从小到大，一批批办起了工厂。事实驳倒了右倾保守思想，像剧中人徐奶奶所说的：“我就没听说过作媳妇的能办工厂，你们还想上天哪？”是的，过去没听说过的事情，今天在解放了的妇女手里干出来了，而且干得很出色，她们就是要亲手创造共产主义天堂。像剧里生龙活虎一般的共青团员郑秀云，这个广大妇女、千百个共青团员的形象，她们听了党的话，浑身是劲，党号召办工厂，没有厂房、没有工具，不懂技术，这些困难都吓不倒她们；讽刺讥笑也动摇不了她们。她们说：“我们有党和毛主席领导，工厂就办得起来。”一支气筒起家，生产就搞起来了。像崔大嫂这样朴实的劳动妇女，旧社会夺去了亲人，饱受风霜；到了新社会党给了她新的力量和幸福生活。你看，她变得多么年轻，多么热爱生活，把革命当作自己的事业，把工厂当作自己的家。当一些人动摇退厂的时候，她和郑秀云、金玉芝一起坚决把工厂办下去；当她在即将举行婚礼的时候，还在专心一意地试验技术革新的机器。
    当然，人民公社的孕育和成长的过程中，一直是贯穿着两条道路——社会主义道路和资本主义道路——的斗争。当小业主赵师傅为了追求利润拒绝接受农村万年青人民公社建立化肥厂所急需的一批玻璃仪器的时候，郑秀云、金玉芝严肃地批判了这种专为赚钱走资本主义道路的思想，坚持了街道工业为大工厂、为人民生活、为农业服务的方针。随着街道生产的大发展，需要进一步举办集体生活福利事业，使广大家庭妇女摆脱家务拖累；当大家听说金玉芝把孩子放在米缸里的时候，她们多么迫切需要解决孩子问题啊！党及时帮助了她们，周书记来到这里，托儿所、幼儿园、服务站、千人大食堂都办起来了。她们笑逐颜开了。徐奶奶当了托儿所所长，嫌脏怕累的玉凤转变了，当了服务员。共产党员、退休工人郝大爷到处奔忙，辛辛苦苦，对党对社会主义事业赤胆忠心的高尚品质，热心为人民群众服务的精神，这一切对我们来说都是多么熟悉和亲切，这是千千万万家庭妇女在党的培养教育下，在生活上、精神面貌上发生巨大变化的真实写照。
    这个戏写得很好，演出也很成功，真实地反映了在毛主席思想光辉照耀下，一年多来城市街道和广大妇女精神面貌的巨大变化，这是一支城市人民公社的颂歌。（附图片）
