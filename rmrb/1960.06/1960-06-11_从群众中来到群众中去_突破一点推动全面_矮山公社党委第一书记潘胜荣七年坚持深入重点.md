    From the Masses, To the Masses: Breakthrough at One Point to Promote Overall Progress
    Pan Shengrong, First Secretary of Aishan Commune Party Committee, Persists in Going Deep into Key Areas for Seven Years

    (Our report) Nanning—Pan Shengrong, First Secretary of the Aishan Commune Party Committee in Yishan, Guangxi, has consistently persisted in going deep into key areas for seven years, discovering problems, solving problems, creating experiences, and guiding overall work. In the past, the Pantang Agricultural Cooperative, which he directly led, was rated as a model cooperative in the entire autonomous region. Last year, Aishan Commune was also rated as an advanced agricultural unit in the region, and he himself was selected as an advanced worker in the region. At present, the commune's production is better than the same period last year, with 53,440 mu of spring-sown crops, more than five times the increase compared to last year, and rice transplanting was earlier than last year by one solar term.

    Moving the Office to a Key Team
    As early as the winter of 1958, Pan Shengrong moved the Commune Party Committee office to Pantang Village, eating and living with the members of the key production team. This way, he could use the time before and after meals, and during meeting breaks, to study work with the cadres and members of the key production team. In mid-March, he returned from a meeting in Wuzhou. Before even putting down his luggage, he went to the rice paddies to see how the seedlings were growing. At this time, the first batch of seedlings sown were already four inches tall, but there was no sign of transplanting. He asked the commune members, who all said that the seedlings were still short and it was not yet time for transplanting. Pan Shengrong believed that if this ideological problem was not solved, rice transplanting could not be done early, so he immediately consulted with the production team leader, Qin Ruiying, and convened a meeting to analyze the benefits of early rice transplanting, criticize the idea that the seedlings were short and it was not yet time for transplanting. The next day, all the brigades started transplanting rice.

    Many Close Friends
    In order to do a good job in the key production team, Comrade Pan Shengrong paid close attention to making close friends with the cadres and masses of the key team, especially those poor old farmers with rich production experience. These friends were his advisors, his staff officers, and his teachers. Whenever he had something to discuss, he would consult with these friends and humbly ask them for advice. This expanded his sources of information, allowing him to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. One evening in late February, Comrade Pan Shengrong was holding a meeting in the Commune Party Committee office when Qin Yunzhu, an old farmer from the Qin Ruiying production team, rushed in and said to Pan Shengrong, "The Tang Qixiu production team has more than a thousand catties of grain seeds that haven't been treated with semi-aquatic cultivation, and the seedlings have rotted." Upon hearing this, Pan Shengrong immediately took a lamp to the rice paddies to see, and indeed they had rotted. This gave him great inspiration. Based on this situation, he organized meetings and visits, corrected the incorrect seedling cultivation methods, and prompted the entire commune's second batch of more than 90,000 catties of seeds to all be treated with semi-aquatic cultivation methods, and fertilized with warming fertilizer according to the experience of the Qin Ruiying production team.

    Timely Discovery and Resolution of Problems
    Whenever he had free time, Pan Shengrong would work alongside the commune members, which made it easier to maintain close contact with the masses, discover problems, and solve problems in a timely manner. One morning in February this year, before dawn, Pan Shengrong led more than ten cadres from the commune, carrying hoes and seeds, up the mountain to plant velvet beans. When the old farmer Huang Jinxiang saw Pan Shengrong leading the cadres up the mountain, he grabbed a loudspeaker and shouted, "Hey! Secretary Pan and the commune cadres are planting velvet beans! We have to hurry up too!" When the members of the Qin Ruiying and Tang Qixiu production teams heard the broadcast, they quickly came. In an instant, a bustling production scene appeared on the rolling Jiulong Mountain. Pan Shengrong was digging holes, placing seeds, and covering them with soil along with everyone when he suddenly heard the old farmer Qin Xiuzhen exclaim: "If planting like this also leads to food, then rice won't be worth anything!" Pan Shengrong felt strange and went closer to look. It turned out that the pit that had just been dug was only two inches deep. The quality issue caught his attention. So, he gathered several production team leaders, old farmers, and work point recorders to work out the quality standards for sowing, stipulating that commune members should check each other, and that the work point recorders should inspect at the end of the work day, only recording work points for those that met the standards. That evening, Pan Shengrong convened a telephone conference, introducing the experience of ensuring the quality standards of velvet bean sowing, and requiring all brigades to pay attention to quality when planting velvet beans.

    Familiarity Breeds Authority
    Because he has persisted in going deep into key production teams for seven years and made close friends with the cadres and commune members of the production teams, Pan Shengrong is truly familiar with all aspects of the production teams. Because of this, as long as he talks to the cadres and commune members casually or takes a look in the fields, he can discover problems. For example, one day in late January this year, he returned from attending the autonomous region's representative conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in agricultural socialist construction. While talking to the production team leader Qin Ruiying about the production situation in the fields, when he asked about the spring corn planting situation, Qin Ruiying said, "It's all planted!" Pan Shengrong was a little skeptical. He thought: According to the labor force of this production team, while completing tasks such as accumulating and transporting fertilizer and leveling field foundations, it was impossible to plant all the spring corn in a few days. He asked, "How many mu have you planted?" Qin Ruiying said, "Thirty-five mu." Pan Shengrong said, "You planted 155 mu last year, how can planting only 35 mu be finished?" Qin Ruiying said, "We planted a lot of winter wheat last year, and the remaining 35 mu of dry land have all been planted. There is no more land left." Pan Shengrong said, "I know that, we should find a way to solve the problem of the lack of land, the spring corn planting area must be larger than last year." So, they studied the problem of solving the lack of land and decided to intercrop corn on 100 mu of wheat land and cultivate 30 mu of wasteland. As a result, this production team planted a total of 165 mu of spring corn. From the situation of the Qin Ruiying production team, Pan Shengrong considered that last year the winter wheat planting in the entire commune expanded by more than 9,000 mu, taking up most of the dry land, and the lack of land to plant spring corn was a common problem. After inspection, it was found that the spring corn in other brigades and production teams was also planted less than last year, so he immediately convened an on-site meeting in the Qin Ruiying production team to promote their experience in solving the problem of the lack of land. After the meeting, each production team adopted the method of intercropping and reclaiming wasteland to expand the planting of spring corn, and the entire commune planted a total of 6,336 mu, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year.

    从群众中来到群众中去　突破一点推动全面
    矮山公社党委第一书记潘胜荣七年坚持深入重点
    本报讯　广西宜山矮山公社党委第一书记潘胜荣七年来一贯坚持深入重点，发现问题，解决问题，创造经验，指导全面。过去他直接领导的畔塘农业社曾被评为全自治区的模范社，去年矮山公社又被评为全区农业先进单位，他本人也被评选为全区先进工作者。目前，这个公社的生产比去年同期搞得更好，春种作物五万三千四百四十亩，比去年增加五倍多，插秧比去年提早了一个节令。
    把办公室搬到重点队
    潘胜荣在1958年冬天就将公社党委办公室搬到了畔塘村，吃和住都同重点生产队的社员在一起。这样，就能利用饭前饭后、会议休息时间，同重点生产队的干部和社员一起研究工作。3月中旬，他从梧州开会回来，还没有放下行李，就先到秧田里看秧苗生长情况。这时第一批播种的秧苗已长有四寸高了，可是还不见插秧的动静。他问起社员们，都说秧苗还短，插秧的时候还没有到。潘胜荣认为这个思想问题不解决，就不能提早插秧，便立即找生产队长覃瑞英商量，又召开了会议，分析了提早插秧的好处，批判了认为秧苗短、插秧时间还没有到的思想，第二天，各大队都动手插秧了。
    知心朋友多
    为了搞好重点生产队的工作，潘胜荣同志很注意同重点队的干部和群众交知心朋友，特别是注意同那些贫苦的富有生产经验的老农交朋友。这些朋友是他的顾问，是他的参谋，是他的老师。他有事就同这些朋友商量，虚心地向他们请教。这样就使他扩大了耳目，能够及时发现问题和解决问题。2月下旬的一天晚上，潘胜荣同志正在公社党委办公室开会，覃瑞英生产队的老农覃云珠急忙跑来，向潘胜荣说：“唐奇秀生产队有一千多斤谷种没有采取半水育秧，秧苗都烂了。”潘胜荣听了，马上提着灯到秧田去看，果然都烂了。这件事给了他很大的启发，他根据这个情况，组织了会议和参观，纠正了不正确的育秧方法，促使全公社第二批浸的九万多斤种子全部采用半水育秧法，并按照覃瑞英生产队的经验施上了保温肥。
    及时发现和解决问题
    一有空，潘胜荣就和社员们一道劳动，这样更便于密切联系群众，及时发现问题和解决问题。今年2月间的一天早上，天蒙蒙亮，潘胜荣带领公社的十多个干部，扛起锄头，背着种子，上山去种猫豆。老农黄金样一见潘胜荣带领干部上山了，就找了个广播筒，拉长嗓子广播起来：“喂！潘书记和公社干部去种猫豆了，我们也要赶快罗！”覃瑞英和唐奇秀生产队的社员们听到广播，很快都赶来了。霎时间，连绵起伏的九龙山上，出现了一片热气腾腾的生产景象。潘胜荣正在和大家一起挖坑、放种、盖土，忽然听到老农覃秀珍感叹地说：
  “要是这样种也得吃，天下的米就不值钱了！”潘胜荣感觉奇怪，走近一看，原来这里刚挖的一个坑只有两寸来深。质量问题引起了他的注意。于是，他找了几个生产队长、老农、记分员，一起研究出播种的质量规格，规定社员要互相检查，收工时记分员要验收，合规格的才按数记给工分。晚上，潘胜荣又召开了电话会议，介绍了保证播种猫豆的规格质量的经验，要求各大队种猫豆都要注意质量。
    熟悉情况有发言权
    由于七年来坚持深入重点生产队，和生产队的干部、社员交知心朋友，潘胜荣对这个生产队各方面的情况真是了如指掌。正因为这样，只要和干部、社员随便谈一谈，到田间看一看，他就能够发现问题。如今年1月下旬的一天，他参加自治区农业社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会回来，在田头和生产队长覃瑞英谈生产情况，当他问到春玉米种植情况时，覃瑞英说：“种完了！”潘胜荣有些怀疑，他想：按照这个生产队的劳动力情况，在完成积肥运肥、铲田基等工作的同时，不可能几天内把春玉米都种完了。他问道：“种了多少亩？”覃瑞英说：“种了三十五亩。”潘胜荣说：“你们去年种一百五十五亩，今年只种三十五亩怎么就完了？”覃瑞英说：“去年冬种小麦多，剩下的三十五亩旱地都种上了，再没有土地了。”潘胜荣说：“这个我知道，应该想办法解决缺土地的问题，春玉米的种植面积一定要比去年扩大。”于是他们研究了解决缺土地问题，决定在小麦地里间种玉米一百亩，开荒种三十亩，结果这个生产队共种下春玉米一百六十五亩。从覃瑞英生产队的情况，潘胜荣考虑到去年全公社冬种小麦扩大了九千多亩，占去了大部分旱地，缺土地种春玉米是个普遍问题。经过检查，发现其他大队和生产队的春玉米也比去年种得少，就立即在覃瑞英生产队召开了现场会议，推广他们解决缺少土地问题的经验，会后，各个生产队都采取间种和开荒的办法扩种春玉米，全公社共种上六千三百三十六亩，比去年扩大了50％以上。
