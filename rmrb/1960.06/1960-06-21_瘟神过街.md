The Plague God Crosses the Street

Six, Little Lu escaped danger but was chased away by big cannons, and hurriedly went to Okinawa Island. 100,000 people blocked the way,
	“Return our land!” roared the crowd. He could only stay for an hour and a half, the situation was "worse" than expected. Hagerty's experience helped, he didn't take the main road but took the small road. Finally he passed the remote road, but couldn't go to the airport. The president's speech, though short, was meaningful: the United States and Okinawa have a "good relationship."

六、小路脱险刚被大炮轰跑，匆匆又到冲绳岛。十万人民挡住去路，
  “还我土地！”一片怒吼。只能停留一个半小时，情况比预料的“更糟”。哈格蒂的经验帮了忙，不走大道走小道。总算走过偏僻道，要去机场去不了。总统的讲话虽短有味道：美国和冲绳“关系良好”。东方剑　诗　方成　画（附图片）
