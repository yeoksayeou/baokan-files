    The Japanese People Have Stood Up!
    Huang Yanpei
    In 1903, when I was in my twenties, I fled to Japan. As a refugee, I was taken in, and I naturally felt a deep affection for the Japanese people. Later, I went to Japan countless times, made many Japanese friends, and wrote many poems and articles. The most recent time was in 1931, just before the "September 18th Incident" when the Japanese warlords opened fire on our country.
    During my time in Japan, I could never forget Mr. Seichi Tejima, who served as the principal of Tokyo Higher Technical School for more than 30 years. He cordially invited me to his home for long talks. He said, "Our Japan only knows how to promote education that serves the bourgeoisie. How can we solve the livelihood problems of the working people?" The old man also said, "The people of China and Japan must be sincerely friendly. I am old (over seventy years old at that time), you should work hard, and one day our two peoples will awaken." After that, the old man often corresponded with me. In less than a few years, the old man died. This matter was recorded in my writings "Southeast Ocean Education" and "Around the Yellow Sea."
    The Japanese militarists opened fire in Shenyang, China on "September 18th," opened fire in Shanghai on "January 28th," and then launched the "Marco Polo Bridge Incident," spreading the flames of war from Beijing to half of China, causing heavy losses to the Chinese people. The Chinese people never attributed such deep hatred to the Japanese people, but only recognized it as the doing of the Japanese militarists who committed the insane direct crimes. Japanese friends! Look at the result of madness? Victory always belongs to the righteous people, and Japanese militarism failed shamefully.
    Now the Japanese people have stood up. This time, to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's revival of militarism and the conclusion of the so-called new Japan-U.S. Security Treaty; to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's trampling on the Diet and beating of Diet members; to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's welcoming the arch-enemy, the ferocious and evil imperialist boss Eisenhower to visit Japan, the Japanese people held nationwide general strikes and demonstrations, with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands... Participants included workers, farmers, students, teachers, journalists, business people, religious figures, women, writers, poets, actors, etc., one circle larger than another, one wave higher than another. The storm of struggle has swept across Japan.
    The matter is very clear. U.S. imperialism, taking China and the Soviet Union as enemies, has expanded many new military preparations. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the establishment of missile bases on Okinawa. Eisenhower has publicly admitted that sending spy planes to invade other countries' airspace is U.S. policy. This further exposes his true face as a war peddler in front of the Japanese people and the people of the world. Who are friends and who are enemies, the Japanese people can already see clearly.
    I am thinking: people from all walks of life in Japan have stood up. Are there any patriotic elements among the soldiers? Sure enough, an old soldier and a young soldier wrote letters to the Asahi Shimbun. Saburo Endo, an old soldier nearing seventy, learned from his historical lessons and believed that the "New Security Treaty," which takes China, the Soviet Union, and the Asian people as enemies, is neither secure nor protective for Japan. Kazo Yamamoto, a 26-year-old member of the Self-Defense Forces, is unwilling to sell his life for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' war of aggression. He swore to the people: he will never fire a gun for a war of aggression. I think there must be more than just Saburo Endo as a patriotic elderly soldier; there must be more than just Kazo Yamamoto as a patriotic young and middle-aged soldier.
    Shinichiro Tomonaga, a Japanese atomic physicist, said it well: Now is the time when natural scientists cannot ignore politics. Just talking about abolishing nuclear weapons will not eliminate war. The core is the political system issue. Yes, among Japanese friends, more people will recognize this central issue. This may be the "day of awakening" that old man Seichi Tejima spoke of.
    The fate of the Japanese nation must be in the hands of the Japanese people themselves. U.S. imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi suppress the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, and will eventually eat their own bitter fruit. The Japanese people will not forgive them!
    Now, under the impact of the brave Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government is already tottering and in imminent danger. Its master, Eisenhower, is personally going to cheer up and put pressure on his running dog, and to plot new conspiracies. However, the 18th National Unified Action of Japan has already begun, and their conspiracies will certainly suffer greater failures in the face of the struggling Japanese people! (Attached picture)
    Six hundred million arms are supporting you, brave Japanese people!

### 日本人民站起来了！

    日本人民站起来了！
    黄炎培
    1903年我二十多岁时，曾流亡到日本。一个亡命者，受到收容，我对日本人民很自然地有着亲切的感情。后来，我去日本不知多少次，交过不少日本朋友，写过不少诗和文。最近一次就是1931年，日本军阀向我国开炮的“九一八”前夕。
    我在日本，使我不能忘怀的，是在东京高等工业学校担任三十多年校长的手岛精一先生。他曾殷勤地招待我到他家里长谈。他说：“我们日本，但知提倡为资产阶级效力的教育，哪里会为劳动人民解决生计问题。”老人还说：“中日两国人民必须真诚地亲善。我老了（那时七十多岁），你们好好地干，将来我们两国人民总有觉悟的一天。”此后老人经常和我通信。不到几年，老人死了。这事曾记在我写的“东南洋教育”和“黄海环游记”两种书刊上。
    日本军国主义者“九一八”在我国沈阳开炮，“一二八”在上海开炮，接下来发动“芦沟桥事件”，战火从北京延烧到半个中国，使中国人民遭受到重大的损失。中国人民对这样深仇大恨，从来不记在日本人民身上，而只认定是疯狂的直接犯罪的日本军国主义者所为。日本朋友们！请看疯狂的结果怎样呢？胜利永远属于正义的人民，日本军国主义可耻地失败了。
    现在日本人民站起来了。这次为了反对岸信介复活军国主义，缔结所谓新的日美安全条约；为了反对岸信介蹂躏国会，殴打议员；为了反对岸信介欢迎大仇人穷凶极恶的帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔访日，日本人民举行全国大罢工、大游行，几千人、几万人、几十万人……参加者有工人、农民、学生、教员、新闻记者、工商业者、宗教家、妇女、作家、诗人、演员等等，一圈大一圈，一浪高一浪。斗争的风暴已经席卷了日本全国。
    事情是很明白的了。美帝国主义以中苏两国为敌，扩张了不少新的军备。最近美众议院又批准在冲绳岛建立导弹基地。艾森豪威尔已经公开承认派间谍飞机侵犯他国领空是美国的国策。这就在日本人民和世界人民面前，更进一步地暴露了他的战争贩子的真面目。谁是朋友，谁是敌人，日本人民已经可以看得清清楚楚了。
    我正在想：日本各界各阶层的人民都站起来了，军人中间有没有爱国分子呢？果然，一位老军人，一位青年军人写信给朝日新闻。年近七十的老军人远藤三郎吸取他的历史教训，认为以中苏、亚洲人民为敌的“新安全条约”，对日本说来，既不安，也不保。二十六岁自卫队员山本一三，他不愿为美日反动派侵略战争卖命，他向人民宣誓：决不为侵略战争开枪。我想爱国的老年军人必不止远藤三郎一人；爱国的青壮年军人也必不止山本一三一人。
    日本原子物理学家朝永振一郎的话说得好：现在到了自然科学家不能不过问政治的时候了。只说废核武器，不会消除战争的。中心是政治制度问题。是的，日本朋友中间，将会有更多的人认清这个中心问题的。这时候可能正是手岛精一老人所说的“觉悟的一天”到了。
    日本国家的命运，一定要由日本人民掌握在自己手里，美帝国主义和它的走狗岸信介压制日本人民的爱国正义斗争，最后一定会自食其果，日本人民是不会饶恕他们的！
    现在岸信介政府在勇敢的日本人民冲击之下，已经摇摇欲坠，危在旦夕。它的主子艾森豪威尔正亲自前去给他的走狗打气和施加压力，布置新的阴谋，但是，日本第十八次全国统一行动已经展开，他们的阴谋在斗争的日本人民面前一定会遭到更大的失败！（附图片）
    六亿双手臂在支持你们，英勇的日本人民！
