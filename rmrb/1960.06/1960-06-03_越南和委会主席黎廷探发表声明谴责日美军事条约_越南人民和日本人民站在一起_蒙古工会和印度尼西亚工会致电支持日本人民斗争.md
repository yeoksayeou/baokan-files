Xinhua News Agency: Hanoi, May 26th: Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, issued a statement on May 26th supporting the Japanese people's 16th unified action struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The statement said that the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, as well as the U.S. imperialists' dispatch of spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and its acts of interference and provocation against other countries, show that U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly pursuing a policy of strength, actively preparing for war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and actively maintaining moribund colonialism.

The statement pointed out that, for the people of Asia and Africa, the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a constant threat.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people hate U.S. imperialism for obstructing the implementation of the Geneva Accords, hate its attempt to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base, hate U.S. imperialism for suppressing national liberation movements, creating international tensions, and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. The Vietnamese people are willing to resolutely strengthen the struggle together with the Japanese people against all provocations and aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism, to defend national independence and defend world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, May 31st: According to today's report in the Mongolian "Labor News," the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions recently sent telegrams to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, expressing support for the joint statement they issued in solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Japan and South Korea against imperialist aggression.

The telegram said that the so-called U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese authorities is an aggressive alliance treaty that drags the Japanese people into a new war and puts the people of Asia at risk of war, and is also a sinister conspiracy to realize the U.S. policy of reviving Japanese militarism.

The telegram said that the people of Asia and the world warmly sympathize with and support the Japanese working class in its struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The telegram pointed out that it is imperative to immediately stop the bloody rule of U.S. imperialism in South Korea, stop interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean people, and provide conditions for the peaceful reunification of their homeland for the people of North and South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 31st: The Central Organization of All Indonesian Workers' Unions sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on May 30th, supporting its general strike to be launched on June 4th to strengthen the national united action of the Japanese people demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and opposition to the ratification of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The telegram said that the Central Organization of All Indonesian Workers' Unions, on behalf of its 2.7 million members, expresses its deep respect to the Japanese workers and people for their indomitable and heroic struggle for national independence, democracy, and world peace.

The telegram said, "We are deeply convinced that, after the collapse of the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, the world will once again see the collapse of another reactionary Kishi Nobusuke clique supported by the United States in the Far East in the near future."

    新华社讯　越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探于5月26日发表声明，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的第十六次统一行动斗争。
    声明说，日美军事同盟条约的签订以及美帝国主义派间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空和它对其他国家的干涉和挑衅行动，说明美帝国主义仍旧顽固地执行实力政策、积极准备战争来反对苏联和其他社会主义国家，并积极维持垂死的殖民主义。
    声明指出，对亚非人民来说，日美军事同盟条约是一个经常性的威胁。
    声明说，越南人民痛恨美帝国主义阻挠日内瓦协议的履行，痛恨它企图长期分裂越南、把南越变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，痛恨美帝国主义镇压民族解放运动，制造国际紧张局势，破坏四国首脑会议。越南人民愿坚决同日本人民一起加强斗争，反对美帝国主义的一切挑衅和侵略阴谋，保卫民族独立，保卫世界和平。
    新华社乌兰巴托5月31日电　据蒙古“劳动报”今天报道：蒙古工会中央理事会最近打电报给中华全国总工会、朝鲜职业总同盟和日本工会总评议会，表示支持它们为声援日本、南朝鲜人民反对帝国主义侵略的正义斗争所发表的联合声明。
    电报说，美帝国主义同日本当局签订的所谓日美“安全条约”，是一个把日本人民拖入新战争和使亚洲人民面临战争危险的侵略同盟条约，也是企图实现美国复活日本军国主义政策的一个罪恶阴谋。
    电报说，亚洲和全世界人民热烈同情和支持为反对日美“安全条约”而斗争的日本工人阶级。
    电报指出，立即制止美帝国主义在南朝鲜的血腥统治、停止干涉朝鲜人民的内部事务和为南北朝鲜人民提供使自己祖国和平统一的条件是非常必要的。
    新华社雅加达5月31日电　全印度尼西亚中央职工会5月30日致电日本工会总评议会，支持它为了加强日本人民要求岸信介内阁辞职、解散国会并反对批准日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动而将在6月4日发动的总罢工。
    电报说，全印度尼西亚中央职工会代表它的二百七十万会员向日本工人和人民为了民族独立、民主和世界和平所进行的不屈不挠的英勇斗争表示深深的敬意。
    电报说，“我们深信，在南朝鲜李承晚集团垮台以后，在不久的将来，世界将再一次看到美国在远东支持的另一个反动的岸信介集团的垮台。”
