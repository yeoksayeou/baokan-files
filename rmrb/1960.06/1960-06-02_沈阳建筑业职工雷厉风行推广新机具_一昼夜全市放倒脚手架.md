Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram. Shenyang city construction workers, with great drive, vigorously promoted innovation, universally replacing scaffolding, used for thousands of years, with new machinery in one day and night.

The Shenyang city construction workers achieved a great revolution in one day and night as a result of the broad masses of workers engaging in mass movements. In the past, construction workers always transported bricks, mortar, laid bricks, plastered, and installed components on scaffolding. After several months of technical innovation and technical revolution, manual operations such as construction transportation and installation have been replaced by mechanized or semi-mechanized new tools; scaffolders have also created various mechanized and semi-mechanized operating platforms in the innovation movement to replace scaffolding. However, there were two different views on how to quickly and universally promote these technical innovations. One group advocated believing in the wisdom and power of the masses, using mass revolutionary movements to fight a decisive battle and conquer the scaffolding barrier in one fell swoop. Another group advocated taking it slowly, emphasizing the shortage of scaffolders and worrying that dismantling everything at once would affect construction. After analysis, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party actively supported the revolutionary proposition of the former group, criticized the conservative thinking of the latter group, and resoundingly proposed the revolutionary slogan of replacing scaffolding with new machinery in one day and night. This call reflected the ardent desire of the scaffolders and was deeply supported by the broad masses of workers.

On May 2nd, more than six thousand construction workers used the holiday to connect with each other, and under the unified command of the Party, formed hundreds of shock teams, while rushing to manufacture various automatic lifting platforms, high-altitude operating platforms, and other new machinery to replace scaffolding, and at the same time dismantling the existing scaffolding. Leading comrades of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party Committee Secretaries and Managers of various engineering companies all came to the front line to fight alongside the workers. Although the wind and rain were heavy that day, the workers' enthusiasm for battle remained high. In just twenty-four hours, the scaffolding of one hundred and twenty-four construction units throughout the city was completely dismantled under the power of the revolutionary masses, and hundreds and thousands of new operating platforms stood up amidst the cheers of the workers. The workers enthusiastically sang: "The wisdom of the masses is truly great, the thousand-year-old scaffolding is pulled down overnight; the construction appearance has greatly changed, from now on building houses will not need it."

The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the spirit of continuous revolution of the construction workers and the method of using revolutionary mass movements to fight decisive battles against backward and weak links, believing that this revolutionary storm has immeasurable power. At present, many factories and enterprises in the city are widely adopting the method of fighting decisive battles based on the spirit of "having a revolution every few days", so that some effective advanced technologies and experiences can be quickly popularized and improved, making the appearance of enterprises constantly change, and ensuring that production leaps forward at a faster speed.

Liaoning Province, Andong City Construction Engineering Company workers made an "automatic lifting vertical and horizontal bricklaying operating platform" to replace scaffolding. The movement and lifting of this operating platform are all controlled by electric buttons, and the operating platform is also equipped with a feeding device, which can improve work efficiency by twenty-five times.

    沈阳建筑业职工雷厉风行推广新机具
    一昼夜全市放倒脚手架
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳市建筑业职工雷厉风行大搞革新，一昼夜间普遍用新机具代替了千百年来沿用的脚手架。
    沈阳市建筑业职工一昼夜实现一次大革命，是广大职工大搞群众运动的结果。过去，建筑工人们一直是在脚手架上运砖、运灰、砌砖、抹灰和安装构件。经过几个月来的技术革新和技术革命运动，建筑运输和安装等手工操作都已为机械化或半机械化的新工具所代替；架子工也在革新运动中创造了各种机械化和半机械化的操作台，用来代替脚手架。但是，如何把这些技术革新成果迅速普遍推广却有两种不同的主张。一种人主张要相信群众的智慧和力量，用群众革命运动的方法，打个歼灭战，一举攻下脚手架关；一种人主张慢慢来，强调架工不足，担心一下放不倒，影响施工。中共沈阳市委经过分析后，积极地支持了前一种人的革命主张，批判了后一种人的保守思想，响亮地提出了一昼夜用新机具代替脚手架的革命号召。这一号召反映了架子工的热切愿望，深受广大职工的拥护。
    5月2日，六千多建筑工人们利用假日互相串连，在党的统一指挥之下，组成上百个突击队，一边赶制代替脚手架的各种自动升降作业台、高空作业台等新机具，一边放倒已有的脚手架。中共沈阳市委的领导同志和各工程公司的党委书记、经理都亲临前线，同工人一起战斗。尽管当天风雨很大，职工们战斗热情一直炽烈。不过二十四小时，全市一百二十四个施工单位的脚手架，在革命群众的威力之下，全部放倒了，成百上千座新操作台，在职工们的欢呼声中矗立起来。职工们热情地歌颂道：“群众智慧真伟大，千年架子一夜拔；施工面貌大改观，从此盖楼不用它。”
    中共沈阳市委十分重视建筑业职工这种不断革命的精神和采用革命群众运动对落后薄弱环节打歼灭战的方法，认为这种革命风暴具有不可估量的威力。目前，全市许多工厂、企业正在根据几天革个命的精神，广泛采用打歼灭战的办法，使一些行之有效的先进技术经验迅速得到普及和提高，使企业面貌不断改观，保证生产以更快的速度跃进。（附图片）
