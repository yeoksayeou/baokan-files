Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 6th. The All-India Congress Committee of the ruling Indian National Congress party concluded its two-day meeting in Pune on June 4th and 5th in haste.

According to a June 6th report by the Press Trust of India, Nehru spoke on the international situation at the meeting on June 5th. When discussing the breakdown of the Four-Power Summit, he reiterated that he was unwilling to condemn the aggressor. He said that he and UAR President Nasser both felt that "condemning others or condemning great powers everywhere" "cannot serve the cause of peace."

Nehru also believed that "it is particularly regrettable that both sides have made various accusations against each other afterward." He also opposed criticizing "the greatest figures who are symbols and representatives of the country," saying that "things will only get worse" by doing so.

Nehru also accused the Soviet government's decision to strike at the bases from which aggressive aircraft take off as likely to cause a world war. He said, "Think of the consequences of such things," "if they [the Soviet Union] do that, then inevitably, the next step will be for the other side to come out and say: 'Ah, this cannot be tolerated,' and then a major war will begin."

According to the Press Trust of India, Nehru attacked the Communist Party as a "backward and reactionary organization" when speaking at the meeting on June 4th. Nehru also said, "I agree that the Communists have great enthusiasm and ability to work—stronger than us, but their spiritual views are outdated and reactionary."

Speaking about differences of opinion within the Congress Party, Nehru admitted that in the elections of chairmen and secretaries of the Congress Party's state committees, various "means" of "cheating to obtain these positions" were often used, and there were even incidents of recruiting fake party members to achieve personal goals.

After a heated debate, the meeting rejected a proposal that one-third of the members of the Congress Party Working Committee (the party's highest executive body) should be elected.

According to the Press Trust of India, when the above proposal was put to a vote, there was a rare situation in the history of the Congress Party, namely that Nehru was in the minority.

On the 4th, about two thousand people in Pune, ignoring the police ban, went to the meeting place of the Congress Party to demonstrate, demanding that the areas where they live, which belong to Mysore State, be incorporated into Maharashtra State and Gujarat State according to the principle of dividing states by language. The police arrested the leaders of the demonstration, so these more than two thousand demonstrators voluntarily followed them to jail.

The All-India Congress Committee passed a resolution on the 5th opposing the re-division of states based on language.

    尼赫鲁再次表示不愿谴责侵略
    认为反对侵略“就不能为和平事业服务”
    指责苏联反击侵略者的决定会引起世界大战
    新华社新德里6日电　印度执政党国大党全国委员会在6月4日和5日在浦那举行了两天会议，已草草结束。
    据印度新闻处6日报道，尼赫鲁5日在会上就国际局势讲话。他在谈到四国首脑会议的破裂时再次表示，他不愿谴责侵略者。他说，他和阿联总统纳赛尔都觉得，“到处谴责别人或者谴责大国”，“就不能为和平事业服务”。
    尼赫鲁还认为，“特别令人遗憾的是事后双方互相提出了各种各样的指责。”他还反对批评“国家的象征和代表的最大的人物”，他说，这样，“事情就更糟了”。
    尼赫鲁还指责苏联政府关于打击侵略飞机起飞的基地的决定将引起世界大战。他说，“请想一想这种事情的后果”，“要是他们（苏联）那样做，那末必然，下一步将是另一方出来说话：‘啊，这可不能容许’，于是大战就会开始了”。
    据印度报业托辣斯的消息，尼赫鲁4日在会上讲话时曾经攻击共产党是一个“落后反动的组织”。尼赫鲁还说，“我同意共产党人有很大的热情和工作能力——比我们强，但是他们的精神观点是过时的、反动的。”
    尼赫鲁谈到国大党内意见分歧时承认，在国大党邦委员会的主席和书记的选举中常常使用各种各样“骗取这些职位”的“手段”，甚至还有征集假党员来达到个人目的的情事。
    会议经过激烈的辩论后否决了一项关于国大党工作委员会（党的最高执行机关）的三分之一成员应由选举产生的建议。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在表决上述建议时，出现了国大党历史上罕见的情况，即尼赫鲁处于少数派的地位。
    4日，在浦那约有两千多人不顾警察的禁止，前往国大党开会地点示威，要求把他们居住的属于迈索尔邦的地方按划分语言邦的原则划入马哈拉施特拉邦和古吉拉特邦。警察逮捕了示威的领导人，于是这两千多示威者自愿跟着去坐牢。
    国大党全国委员会5日通过了一项决议，反对再根据语言重新划分邦。
