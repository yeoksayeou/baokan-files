Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 6th: The Vietnam News Agency reports that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front has written to the two co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, requesting them to take all necessary measures to make the Lao Kingdom government comply with and implement the Geneva Agreements and Vientiane Agreements that they have signed.

Published in the Lao Patriotic Front's organ "Lao Patriotic News" on May 17th, the letter, dated May 15th, exposes the election fraud that occurred in Laos in April of this year to the two chairmen. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recalls that in its letter of March 21, 1960, to the two chairmen, it had already exposed the attempts by American interventionists to establish, through general elections, a National Assembly composed of a majority of reactionaries and controlled by members of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" in order to legitimize the military dictatorship in Laos.

The letter states, "Facts have fully confirmed our predictions." The recent elections, held under the threat of bayonets, were in fact a major fraud, with extremely serious and widespread acts of terror, corruption, and cronyism.

The letter says that the Lao people have indignantly declared the illegal elections of April 1960 to be invalid, and they demand that elections be held again with genuine and supervised guarantees of freedom, universality, and security.

After exposing the fact that the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" excluded patriotic forces from the general elections, the letter condemns the Lao warlord clique for squeezing the Lao Patriotic Front out of the National Assembly, dealing a fatal blow to the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, destroying all possibilities for national reconciliation, and also attempting to place the Lao Patriotic Front in an illegal position through false trials, and making arbitrary judgments against Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The letter says that the Lao Patriotic Front is loyal to the spirit of the Geneva Agreements, which clearly stipulates that the unification of Laos must be achieved through free and democratic elections, and believes that as long as unification has not been achieved through truly free and democratic elections, the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements stipulating their implementation remain valid now and in the future for the relevant parties – the Lao Kingdom government and the Lao fighting forces (now the Lao Patriotic Front). Therefore, the Lao Patriotic Front once again considers it an urgent responsibility to request the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to urge the Lao Kingdom government to comply with and implement the agreements that have been signed.

The letter points out that the primary and most urgent thing is to remind the Lao Kingdom government that the solution to the Lao political problem is still within the jurisdiction of the Geneva Agreements. At the same time, in view of the tense situation dangerously aggravated by the criminal election fraud, there is an urgent need to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in order to conduct on-the-spot investigations.

The letter specifically requests the British chairman of the Geneva Conference to reconsider the view that has hitherto allowed the Lao Kingdom government to arbitrarily treat its explicit obligation to correctly implement the Geneva Agreements.

### 老挝爱国战线党中央函日内瓦会议两位主席  要求采取措施使王国政府履行日内瓦协议

    老挝爱国战线党中央函日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求采取措施使王国政府履行日内瓦协议
    新华社河内6日电　据越南通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会写信给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席，要求他们采取一切必要的措施使老挝王国政府遵守和执行他们已签了字的日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    在5月15日发出的这封信发表在5月17日的爱国战线党机关报“老挝爱国新闻”上，信件向两位主席揭发今年4月在老挝发生的选举大骗局。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会回顾说，委员会在1960年3月21日致两位主席的信件中已经向他们揭发了美国干涉者企图通过大选成立由大多数反动分子组成并由所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”委员控制的国民议会，以便使老挝的军事独裁政权合法化。
    这封信说，“事实充分证实了我们的预料”。在刺刀威胁下举行的最近的选举事实上只是一个大骗局，大选中恐怖、贪污和营私作弊的手段十分严重和普遍。
    信件说，老挝人民已经愤愤地表示1960年4月的非法选举是无效的，他们要求在对自由、普遍和安全具有真正的和有监督的保障的情况下重新举行选举。
    这封信在揭露“保卫国家利益委员会”在大选中排斥爱国力量的事实之后，谴责老挝军阀集团把老挝爱国战线党排挤出了国民议会，对日内瓦协议和万象协议给予致命打击，摧毁全国和协的一切可能性，还企图通过虚假的审讯把老挝爱国战线党置于非法的地位，对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领袖作出专横的判决。
    信中说，老挝爱国战线党忠于明确规定老挝的统一必须通过自由和民主选举的办法来实现的日内瓦协议的精神，并认为只要还没有通过真正自由和民主的选举的办法实现统一，日内瓦协议和规定其执行办法的万象协议现在和将来对有关双方——老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队（现在是老挝爱国战线党）继续有效，所以老挝爱国战线党再一次认为有迫切的责任要求日内瓦会议的两位主席采取一切必要措施以促使老挝王国政府遵守和执行已经签订的协议。
    这封信指出，首要的最迫切的事情，是提醒老挝王国政府注意：老挝政治问题的解决仍然在日内瓦协议管辖范围以内，同时鉴于被罪恶的选举骗局危险地加剧的紧张状态，迫切需要恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以便就地进行调查。
    信中特别要求日内瓦会议的英国主席重新考虑这样的一种见解，这种见解迄今为止放任老挝王国政府任意对待自己所承担的正确履行日内瓦协议的明确义务。
