    Meeting at the Pithead, Implementation from Top to Bottom
    The Ping'an No. 1 Mine Convenes a New Type of Production Meeting, Boosting Morale and Quickly Resolving Problems
    (Our newspaper, Fuxin, June 13th) The Ping'an No. 1 Mine in Fuxin Coal Mine has adopted a three-in-one mass production meeting approach, implementing the Party's instructions and work arrangements from top to bottom, directly engaging with the masses, and greatly promoting production.
  In April, the Ping'an No. 1 Mine produced over 22,000 tons of coal, only fulfilling 88.3% of its plan. After implementing the new mass production meetings in May, the mine produced over 31,000 tons of coal for the entire month, exceeding the plan by 11%; tunneling also reached over 1,200 meters, exceeding the plan by nearly half, achieving a "May Overall Red."
    The three-in-one mass production meeting is a mass meeting held before each shift goes down the mine, attended by leading cadres from various departments of the pithead, technicians, and all workers on duty. These meetings usually only take about 30 minutes. At the meeting, pithead cadres directly convey the Party's instructions to all mine workers, and finally, workers discuss and engage in mutual competitions.
    This new type of production meeting is very different from previous production meetings. Previous production meetings were cold and deserted, with only section chiefs and team leaders or above participating. After studying the production plan for the shift, they would separately return to the section to hold pre-shift meetings to convey the plan to the workers. This layer-by-layer communication was slow and, because grassroots cadres did not have a deep enough understanding of the leadership's intentions, the effect was often poor, and many arrangements could not truly become the workers' conscious actions. Therefore, this type of production meeting could not adapt to the current requirements of high morale and a production leap forward. After summarizing the experiences and lessons in this regard, the Party branch of Ping'an No. 1 Mine decided from May onwards to combine the production meetings attended by a few cadres with the workers' pre-shift meetings, turning them into new production meetings attended by all mine workers. Convening this new type of production meeting allows the Party's instructions to be implemented from top to bottom, allowing the masses to understand the leadership's intentions in a timely manner and better mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for production. Workers said: "The new production meeting means we make our own plans and implement them ourselves, and we will definitely guarantee that what we say is what we do." And indeed, that is the case. At one production meeting, coal mining team leader Li Chunhe responded to the Party's call and launched a competition with the Lu Yuling coal mining team, revising the original plan of producing 100 carts of coal to 120 carts, and ultimately completing 134 carts. In April, the attendance rate of the first coal mining section was very low. After the workers participated in the production meeting, they supervised each other, and the attendance rate increased from 76% to 92%. Because every worker has a clear understanding of the entire mine's production, their sense of responsibility is stronger.
    This new type of production meeting is also very beneficial for changing leadership styles and overcoming subjectivity and one-sidedness in work. Liu Zhimin, the head of the coal mining section, said: "In the past, I was just running errands, conveying information incompletely, resulting in the leaders being dissatisfied, the workers having opinions, and the cadres squabbling. Now, we have reduced the number of meetings and the amount of paperwork, freeing up more time to go down the mine." In order to ensure that the production meeting is successful, most cadres can go deep into the mine before the meeting to understand the production situation and existing problems and prepare for their speeches. After the meeting, section chiefs and team leaders go deep into the mine to help the workers achieve their plans and check the implementation of the Party's instructions. After all the on-duty employees of each department and each job participate in the new production meeting, they meet each other directly, jointly formulate production plans, and greatly strengthen mutual unity and cooperation. After employees from various departments participate in the meeting, they understand the entire mine's production situation and clearly know where the key is, and they take the initiative to solve problems without waiting for the leadership to assign them. The signal line from the thirteenth coal mining section from the yard to the water pump used a rope to pull the bell, and sometimes the number of rings was unclear, which affected production. At the original production meeting, the coal mining section chief shouted every day to replace the line, and the electrical and mechanical section chief emphasized that there was no iron wire, resulting in mutual squabbling. This time, at the mass production meeting, "three parties confronted each other." After the electrical and mechanical workers heard this, they took the initiative to find sections of old wire in the waste pile, connected them together, and in two hours, transformed them into a push-button automatic signal bell underground, solving the key production problem that had been causing arguments for more than two months. The ventilation section had a large project and insufficient manpower. Once this was mentioned at the meeting, people immediately supported with six more workers, quickly solving the problem.
    The leaders of the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee and the Fuxin Mining Bureau attach great importance to this experience, believing that it is a major innovation in enterprise management system. Recently, it has been decided to promote it universally in all pitheads of the bureau.

### 井口开会　一竿子到底  平安一坑召开新型生产会议群众情绪高，问题解决快

    井口开会　一竿子到底
    平安一坑召开新型生产会议群众情绪高，问题解决快
    本报阜新13日电　阜新煤矿平安一坑采用三结合群众性生产会议的方式，把党的指示和工作布置一竿子插到底，跟群众直接见面，大大促进了生产。
  平安一坑4月份生产煤炭二万二千多吨，只完成计划的88．3％。5月份实行新的群众性生产会议后，全月产煤达三万一千多吨，超过计划11％；掘进也达一千二百多米，超过计划几乎一半，获得5月满堂红。
    三结合群众性生产会议，是在每班下井以前召开的有坑口各部门领导干部、技术人员和当班全体工人参加的群众性会议。这种会议通常只要三十分钟左右的时间。会上坑口干部直接向全坑职工传达党的指示，最后工人讨论相互展开比武竞赛。
    这种新的生产会议跟以前的生产会议有很大的区别。以前的生产会议冷冷清清，只有段长、班长以上少数干部参加，研究当班生产计划后，再分头回段开班前会向工人传达。这种层层传达的做法，一方面时间很慢，另一方面由于基层干部对领导意图了解的不够深透，效果往往不好，许多布置不能真正成为工人自觉的行动。因此，这种生产会议就不能适应当前群情振奋、生产跃进的要求。平安一坑的党总支总结了这方面的经验教训后，从5月份起，决定把少数干部参加的生产会议和工人班前会结合起来，变为全坑职工参加的新的生产会议。召开这种新的生产会议，可以把党的指示一竿子插到底，让群众及时了解领导意图，更好地调动群众的生产积极性。工人说：新的生产会是自己订计划自己执行，一定保证说到那做到那。事实也的确如此。在一次生产会议上，采煤队长李春和响应党的号召，同陆玉玲采煤队开展比武竞赛，把原订出一百车煤的计划修改为一百二十车，结果完成了一百三十四车。第一采煤段4月份出勤率很低，工人参加生产会议后，互相督促，出勤率由76％提高到92％。每个工人由于对全坑生产心中有数，责任心更强了。
    这种新的生产会议对改变领导作风，克服工作中的主观、片面性也有很大好处。采煤段长刘志民说：“过去只是跑腿，传达丢三拉四，结果领导不满意，工人有意见，干部扯皮。现在减少了会议，减少了事务，可腾出更多时间多下井。”为了保证开好生产会，大部分干部都能在会前深入井下了解生产情况和存在的问题，进行发言准备。会后，各段长和班长又深入井下帮助工人实现计划，检查党的指示执行情况。各部门各工种当班全体职工参加新的生产会议后，彼此直接见面，共同制订生产计划，大大加强了相互之间的团结协作。各部门职工参加会议后都了解全坑生产情况，明确那里是关键，不等领导分配，就主动去解决。第十三采煤段从场子到水泵的信号线用绳子拉铃，有时点数不清，影响生产。在原来的生产会议上，采煤段长天天喊换线，机电段长强调没有铁线，互相扯皮。这次在群众参加的生产会议上“三堂对案”，机电工人听了，回去后主动在废料堆里找出一节一节的旧电线，把它连接起来，两个小时，就在井下改装成电钮自动信号铃，解决了扯皮二个多月的生产关键。通风段因工程大，人力不足，在会上一说，四面八方立即支援六个人力，很快解决了。
    中共阜新市委和阜新矿务局领导上对这项经验十分重视，认为这是企业管理制度的重大革新。最近已决定在全局各坑口普遍推广。
