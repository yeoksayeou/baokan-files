Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th. Jiangsu Province's industrial and mining enterprises have universally promoted ten major advanced experiences, achieving remarkable results. Currently, the entire province is promoting 119 major experiences within a limited time. During the red May campaign, Jiangsu promoted ten advanced experiences of universal significance, including saving coal, technical transformation of small blast furnaces, "four-in-one" circular power consumption, efficient iron smelting furnaces, and non-cutting processing. According to statistics from six cities, after promoting the experience of saving coal, coal consumption can generally be reduced by 25% to 50%. By the end of May, more than 45% of the province's small blast furnaces had undergone systematic transformation. The utilization coefficient of these small blast furnaces has more than doubled compared to before the transformation. In the machinery industry, non-cutting processing has been realized in the production of 5,161 kinds of parts. Using this method, material consumption is reduced by 10% to 40% compared to the original.
Currently, among the 119 major advanced experiences being promoted within a limited time throughout the province, 22 are in the coal system, 11 in the power system, 27 in the machinery system, 26 in the metallurgy system, and 33 in the chemical industry system. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken the promotion of these advanced experiences as an important measure to transform June into a month of substantial high production.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th. In industrial and mining cities such as Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Hegang in Heilongjiang Province, more than 40 major advanced experiences have been vigorously promoted in the machinery, metallurgy, coal, power, transportation, capital construction, light industry, and chemical industry systems, enabling the production level of industrial and mining enterprises to rise steadily.
The province's power system has universally promoted the "four-in-one power supply and consumption" and new technology experiences of power control systems. Nine industrial cities and thirty-five counties and towns in the province have fully realized cooperation in power supply and consumption; twenty-four substations have realized remote control, excavating a large amount of power potential and a large number of wires, cables, transformers and other electrical equipment, supplying the needs for sustained leap forward in production. Mechanical industrial cities such as Harbin and Qiqihar have promoted various key advanced experiences in casting, forging, and welding. In Qiqihar City, 36 machinery factories have promoted a complete set of advanced experiences in casting, from modeling, pouring, sand cleaning to expanding the capacity of steelmaking electric furnaces, which has greatly improved the degree of mechanization of casting, reduced the number of production workers by half, and increased the production capacity of castings by 54% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The mechanical industry in Harbin City has universally promoted chipless processing. 279 types and more than 9,000 parts and components have been realized by chipless processing, saving a lot of steel for the country. In the three major coal mining areas of Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan, 70% of the coal mining faces have promoted the "four-eight cross operation," and the work efficiency has generally increased by 10% to 30%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th. Jiangxi Province is vigorously promoting major advanced experiences in saving raw materials and fuel.
In order to rapidly popularize and promote ten advanced experiences such as circular power supply and saving coal, various places have widely organized mass visits, demonstrations, exchanges, and shock campaigns. At the same time, the party committee secretaries of various regions, factories, and mines personally took command, taking the lead in learning and promoting. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the Province, also personally went to units such as the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory to encourage employees to vigorously promote advanced experiences.
Some advanced experiences have achieved significant results after promotion. Nanchang City has universally promoted circular power supply, saving more than 40 five thousand kVA transformers and more than 400,000 kWh of electricity. After Nanchang Iron Factory promoted the advanced experience of saving coal, it not only saved 30% of coal but also saved half of the labor force and increased work efficiency three times.

People's Daily, Shanghai, 9th. Shanghai's mechanical industry system is vigorously promoting advanced experiences to address key issues in production, creating favorable conditions for completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year.
Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai machinery industry department has focused on promoting new technologies and processes such as chipless and less-cutting processing, coal-saving and high-efficiency Xin Tai-style pig iron furnaces, and arc-less and less-arc welding, as well as high-efficiency tools, fixtures, and machine tools, and vigorously improved the design of old products. By the end of April, 80% of the pig iron furnaces in the bureau had been converted to the Xin Tai-style; the structure of more than 400 old products had been reformed, and 291 of them had been officially put into production. After the factories promoted the Xin Tai-style pig iron furnace and various experiences in saving coal, coal consumption was reduced by about 40% compared to the past. After workers at the Shanghai Press Machine Tool Factory improved the design of high-pressure oil pumps, they could manufacture thirty oil pumps using the materials used to manufacture one oil pump in the past.
In the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving the results of technological innovation, the Shanghai mechanical industry department held large-scale exhibitions by industry and trade, and carried out advanced operation performance competitions, which achieved good results.

Shanghai Lightning Arrester Factory old worker Xu Donghai boldly broke superstitions, abolished the old technology, adopted new materials, and successfully trial-produced a new type of lightning arrester. This enables one person to do the work of two people, and one material to be used as eight, and the product quality is good. One product can be used as dozens or hundreds of products. This is Xu Donghai viewing the lightning arresters before and after the innovation.
