Concentrate Strength on Summer Harvesting and Planting

This year's summer harvest crops have a characteristic: on a considerable area, the sowing time and management measures are relatively consistent, so the crops mature at a relatively uniform time and grow densely and strongly. To achieve harvesting as soon as ripe and rapid harvesting and threshing, it is necessary to concentrate considerable strength. Similarly, planting immediately after the harvest requires concentrating significant strength. Therefore, in the summer harvesting and planting season, in addition to mobilizing all the strength of the communes themselves, it is also necessary to organize the necessary large-scale collaboration.

The summer harvesting and planting workload is large, and time is pressing, requiring that all mobilizable forces be concentrated on the front lines. Regions and units with different summer harvesting and planting times should support each other; units with a small proportion of summer harvesting and planting should support units with a large summer harvesting and planting workload; all sectors within the people's communes should support summer harvesting and planting; all sectors in towns and cities should allocate appropriate manpower and resources to the countryside during the summer harvesting and planting period; and leaders at all levels should go to the most intensive summer harvesting and planting areas to personally direct the battle.

Large-scale collaboration in harvesting machinery is worth greatly promoting. Large-scale harvesting and threshing machinery, fixed in one place, can only be used for a short time each year, and most of the time they are idle, requiring a lot of manpower and resources to maintain them. Organizing collaboration in harvesting and threshing machinery according to the different harvest seasons in various places can enable crops in various places to be harvested and threshed faster, allowing one machine to do the work of many. Large-scale sowing machinery can also be used in a similar way. To better implement the collaboration of agricultural machinery between regions, transportation, machinery repair, parts and fuel supply departments should participate in this collaboration.

To maximize the strength of various types of collaboration during the summer harvesting and planting period, the most important thing is to strengthen the Party's unified leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and establish collaboration on the basis of ideological unity and voluntary participation. All units and all members participating in the collaboration should highly promote the communist style, regard participating in summer harvesting and planting as a significant and glorious task, and see it as closely related to the work and life of every socialist builder. Not only should they participate with the greatest enthusiasm and the highest initiative, but they should also cherish every minute of time, every crop, and every fruit. The units being supported should be highly concerned about every member participating in the support, and should take great care of every machine participating in the support; and actively prepare to participate in supporting other regions and units. Everyone participates in large-scale collaboration with the communist spirit; and in the process of large-scale collaboration, they encourage and inspire each other, and further improve their communist ideological level. Large-scale collaboration will not only bring a great harvest of crops, but also a great harvest of ideas.

To ensure that large-scale collaboration during the summer harvesting and planting period goes well, it is also necessary to do meticulous organizational work. Each region and commune should, as early as possible, use simple and easy-to-implement methods to make a relatively accurate investigation of the maturity of crops in each unit, the size of the summer harvest area, the amount of labor, power, improved tools and machinery, etc., line them up, and make a comprehensive plan for collaboration within the region or commune. Each unit should also calculate how much labor is needed during the summer harvesting and planting period, how much labor is lacking, and how much manpower and resources can be provided to support other units before and after the busy season. Industrial, transportation, commercial, cultural, educational, health and other units and organizations, groups, schools, troops, and professional teams and community-run enterprise units, and livelihood and welfare units in the people's communes should also make arrangements: on the one hand, actively use the work of their unit to serve summer harvesting and planting; on the other hand, allocate forces to directly participate in the summer harvesting and planting battle. Local Party committees should gather the plans of each unit, provide unified leadership, and make comprehensive arrangements. With a strong team, there must also be specific divisions of labor: dividing responsibilities for each plot of land, dividing responsibilities for each process. Between the various accounting units in the commune, and between the commune and the commune, labor should be recorded according to work in the collaboration, and equivalent exchange should be implemented.

Collaboration can generate infinite power. Here, one plus one does not equal two but is much greater than two. If large-scale collaboration is well organized, in the season of summer harvesting and planting, when agricultural activities are the most time-sensitive and combative, it will be possible to both gain time and ensure quality, promote production and improve thinking.

### 集中力量夏收夏种

    集中力量夏收夏种
    今年的夏收作物有一个特点，就是在相当大的面积上，播种的时间和管理的措施比较一致，所以作物成熟的时间也比较一致，而且长得又密又壮。要做到随熟随收，快收快打，需要集中比较大的力量。收了之后就种，同样需要集中比较大的力量。因此，在夏收夏种时期除了动员公社本身的全部力量以外，还应该组织必要的大协作。
    夏收夏种工作量大，时间紧迫，要求把一切可以动员的力量，都集中到第一线来。夏收夏种时间不同的地区和单位之间要互相支援；夏收夏种比例小的单位要支援夏收夏种工作量大的单位；人民公社内部的各行各业都要支援夏收夏种；城镇的各行各业要在夏收夏种期间抽出适当的人力物力到农村去；各级领导人员都要到夏收夏种最紧张的地方，亲自指挥战斗。
    收获机械的大协作，值得大大提倡。大型的收割和脱粒机械，固定在一个地方，一年只能用很短的时间，绝大部分时间闲放着，还得为保管它们费许多人力物力。按照各地收获季节的不同组织收割和脱粒机械的协作，就可以使各地的庄稼更快地收打，使一台机器顶好多台机器用。大型的播种机械，也可以采取类似的方式使用。为了更好地实行各地区之间农业机械的协作，交通运输、机械检修、零件和燃料供应等部门都要参加这个协作。
    要使夏收夏种期间的各种类型的协作发挥最大的力量，最重要的还是加强党的统一领导，坚持政治挂帅，把协作建立在思想一致、自觉自愿的基础上。参加协作的一切单位、一切成员，要高度发扬共产主义风格，把参加夏收夏种看作重大的光荣的任务，看作同每一个社会主义建设者的工作和生活息息相关的事情。不但要用最大的热情和最高的积极性参加，而且要珍惜每一分钟时间、每一棵庄稼、每一粒果实。被支援的单位，对参加支援的每一个成员要高度关心，对参加支援的每一台机器要十分爱护；并且积极准备参加对其它地区和单位的支援。大家都以共产主义精神参加大协作；在大协作当中，又互相鼓舞，互相启发，进一步提高共产主义思想水平。大协作不只带来庄稼的大丰收，同时也将带来思想的大丰收。
    要使夏收夏种期间的大协作进行得好，还要做好细致的组织工作。各地区各公社要及早把各单位作物成熟的迟早，夏收面积的大小，劳力、动力、改良工具和机械的多少，等等，用简便易行的方式作出比较确实的调查，排一下队，作出本地区或本公社范围内实行协作的全面规划。各单位也要计算一下，本单位在夏收夏种期间需要多少劳动力，缺少多少劳动力，大忙以前和大忙以后可能拿出多少人力物力支援其它单位。各地的工业、交通、商业、文教、卫生等单位和机关、团体、学校、部队，人民公社里的林、牧、副、渔等专业队和社办企业单位、生活福利单位，也都要安排一下：一方面，积极用本单位的工作为夏收夏种服务；另方面，抽出力量来直接参加夏收夏种战斗。各地党委要把各单位的规划集中起来，统一领导，全面安排。有了强大的队伍，还要有具体分工：分工负责各个地块，分工负责各个工序。在公社里的各个核算单位之间、公社与公社之间，在协作中还要按劳记工，实行等价交换。
    协作能够产生无穷的力量。在这里，一加一不是等于二而是比二大得多。大协作组织得好，在夏收夏种这个农事活动的时间性和战斗性最强烈的季节，就能够既争得时间，又争得质量，既促进生产，又提高思想。
