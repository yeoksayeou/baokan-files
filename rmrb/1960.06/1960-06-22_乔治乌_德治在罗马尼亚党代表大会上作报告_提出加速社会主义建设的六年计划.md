Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 20th - Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a report on June 20th at the Third Congress of the Workers' Party on "The Work of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Plan for the Development of the National Economy for 1960-1965 and Long-Term Economic Development Plans."

In his report, Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party would summarize the fruitful and multifaceted activities of the Party, the outstanding achievements made by the working people in the years since the Second Congress of the Party, and would propose the task of completing socialist construction in Romania.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the historic achievements of the period since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party have proven the enormous creative initiative of the working people liberated from exploitation, who are aware that they are the full masters of the wealth of the country and are working for their own welfare.

	Socialist industrial production has increased at a high speed, agricultural cooperativization has been largely realized, and the Five-Year Plan has been completed in four years.

Constantly advancing towards socialism, consistently implementing national industrialization, socialist transformation of agriculture, and cultural revolution are the characteristics of the Party's policy. The country's productive forces have continuously grown, and socialist relations of production in all aspects of the national economy have expanded and been consolidated.

The production of socialist industry has increased at a high speed; many enterprises have been established, and new industrial sectors have been created; the ten-year plan for national electrification has been completed ahead of schedule, and the proportion of industry in the national economy is increasing year by year.

In terms of the socialist transformation of agriculture, agricultural cooperativization has been largely realized. The last exploiting class—the rich peasant class—has been eliminated, thus ending the exploitation of man by man in our country forever.

Now, the entire industry, transportation, commerce, and financial credit systems belong to the socialist economic sector, and in agriculture, four-fifths of the arable land belongs to the socialist economic sector.

Therefore, the socialist economic foundation has been established in the Romanian People's Republic. This is a great victory for the working class, peasants, and intellectuals.

Gheorghiu-Dej continued that the reason why the working people have been able to achieve victory in the cause of building socialism is that we have the correct helmsman—the Romanian Workers' Party. Our Party, loyal to the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, is more united and stronger than ever before when convening the Third Congress, due to its correct political line, principles, and combativeness, and the broad masses of the people resolutely follow our Party.

The reporter then pointed out that the tasks of developing the national economy put forward by the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party have been successfully completed. He said that, according to preliminary materials, by the end of 1960, industrial output value is likely to increase by about 67% compared to 1955. The instructions of the Second Party Congress originally stipulated an increase of 60%-65%.

The reporter pointed out that, judging from the output value of a series of the most important products, the Five-Year Plan has been completed in four years. Completing the task of the machine manufacturing industry one year ahead of schedule is one of the most outstanding achievements in our country's economic activities during this period. In 1960, the output value of the machine manufacturing industry will be doubled compared to 1955, or will be equal to ten times that of 1938.

The task put forward by the Second Party Congress in agriculture to strive for the socialist component to occupy a dominant position in terms of land area and commodity output has been completed by the end of 1959. The socialist component already owns 81% of the country's arable land. Agricultural cooperativization has created favorable conditions for further increasing agricultural and livestock products.

Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the great achievements in various sectors of the national economy have ensured the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people.

	The basic purpose of the Six-Year Plan is to develop the material and technical foundation of socialism and complete the process of establishing socialist relations of production.

When talking about the development plan of the national economy for 1960-1965, Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the basic purpose of this plan is to develop the material and technical foundation of socialism, and to complete the process of establishing socialist relations of production throughout the national economy, in order to complete socialist construction.

The draft directives stipulate that the industrial production in 1965 should increase by nearly 1.1 times compared to 1959. By 1965, the process of agricultural collectivization will be completed, and the total value of agricultural products will increase by 70%-80% compared to 1959, which will ensure abundant agricultural products to continuously improve the people's living standards.

Gheorghiu-Dej then talked about the development of Romania's transportation and post and telecommunications during 1960-1965, the tasks in national economic investment, the adoption of new technologies in production, improving labor productivity, and reducing product costs. He pointed out that during 1960-1965, the total amount of basic investment spent by state funds is stipulated to be 170 billion to 180 billion lei, which means it is almost more than double that of the past six years.

Gheorghiu-Dej also talked about the issue of improving the people's living standards. He pointed out that during 1960-1965, Romania's national income will increase by 70%-80%, the actual wages of employees will increase by 40%-45%, and the income of farmers will increase by about 40%.

Gheorghiu-Dej then said that the completion of the Six-Year Plan will reveal new and more glorious prospects to the Romanian people, that is, the prospect of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communist construction. The draft plan stipulates strengthening the country's socialist industry in order to catch up with those more developed countries in terms of per capita production and consumption levels in the shortest possible time.

	In the recent fifteen years, the average annual growth rate of industrial production has been 12%, and the annual grain output will reach 20 million to 22 million tons.

When talking about the long-term plan for the national economy, Gheorghiu-Dej said that the results of the analysis show that it will be possible to increase the total output value of industrial products by more than five times in the recent fifteen years. The average annual growth rate of industrial production will be 12%. He said that in the recent fifteen years, under normal climatic conditions, the annual grain output will reach 20 million to 22 million tons. By 1975, livestock products will increase by more than three times compared to 1959.

	The Party ranks are stronger and more united around the Party Central Committee, and the Party's leading role in the entire national work, economic, social, and cultural work is constantly strengthening.

When talking about the part about the Party, the reporter said that today our Party is stronger and more united around its own Party Central Committee than at any time in the nearly forty years since its establishment. In the period since the Second Party Congress, very significant achievements have been made in the number and quality of Party members, in the Party's ideological work, and in further strengthening the Party's organizational and political unity. As of June 1 this year, the Romanian Workers' Party has a total of 834,600 members and probationary members, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1955. It is important that more than 72% of the total number of members and probationary members are working directly in industrial enterprises and socialist agriculture. It can be seen that the task set by the Second Party Congress to ensure the dominance of workers in the Party has been successfully completed.

Gheorghiu-Dej talked about the tasks of the Party organization and the Party's activities in ideology and culture. He said that in the future, it is necessary to pay attention to strictly abiding by the Leninist principle of absorbing Party members, encouraging the masses to participate more actively in the discussion of major issues related to the Party's policies, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below regarding the exposure of shortcomings and errors.

In the struggle to complete socialist construction, the Party's leading role in the entire national work, economic, social, and cultural work is constantly strengthening.

He said that it is necessary to subject the theories of various defenders of capitalism in philosophy, law, economics, and history to militant scientific criticism.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Party attaches great importance to the ideological issues of the international communist movement.

	Opposing the anti-Marxist views of the revisionists on the fundamental issues of the present era is of particular significance. The Yugoslav revisionists deny the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and only suit the wishes of the enemies of socialism.

He emphasized that opposing the anti-Marxist views of the revisionists on the fundamental issues of the present era is of particular significance.

The reporter severely condemned the Yugoslav modern revisionists. He said that the revisionists deny the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, which are of universal significance to all countries. One of the main targets of the revisionists' attacks is the Leninist principle of the Party's leading role and the socialist state as a tool for building socialism. The revisionists' views on the cancellation of the Party aim to disarm the working class and disintegrate the working class. This view only suits the wishes of the enemies of socialism. Revisionists have always been and will always be met with the most resolute resistance from communist and workers' parties of all countries.

When talking about the international situation, the reporter said that since the Second Congress of the Party, the most important characteristic of international life has been the strong growth of socialism, progress, and peace forces. The decisive role in this regard is played by the achievements of the socialist countries, the strong upsurge of the national economy and culture of the socialist countries, and the growth of their prestige in the world.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that, together with other fraternal parties, the Romanian Workers' Party has contributed to the struggle to continuously strengthen the unity of the world communist movement and the socialist camp.

Gheorghiu-Dej condemned U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries for attempting to obstruct the easing of international tensions.

He said that in Japan, a massive mass movement against the enslavement of Japan by U.S. imperialism has now unfolded. This event forced the Kishi Nobusuke government to cancel President Eisenhower's visit.

Gheorghiu-Dej also said that during this period, the ranks of the international communist and workers' parties have grown, and their unity has been consolidated. The conspiracies of international reactionaries and their agents to step up sabotaging the unity of the world communist movement and disrupting and mixing into the ranks of the world communist movement have been decisively defeated, because they are facing the unbreakable unity between communist and workers' parties of all countries and their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the declaration adopted at the meeting of communist and workers' parties of all countries held in Moscow in November 1957 pointed out that under the current conditions, the main danger that the international workers' movement must be vigilant against is revisionism. Modern revisionism, which is concentratedly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, has been resolutely and unanimously countered by communist and workers' parties of all countries.

	Resolutely combating the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism is a great contribution to the cause of peace.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the U.S. foreign policy embodies the interests of militarism and the most reactionary monopoly capitalism, and this policy is linked to the arms race. Giving a resolute blow to the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism is the most practical and great contribution to the cause of peace.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that aggression is the nature of imperialism. Imperialism is extremely hostile to the socialist camp and the national liberation movement, and for the sake of its ambition to dominate the world, it will never give up the use of force.

He said that, therefore, socialist countries, communist and workers' parties unanimously believe that the people should be called upon to raise their vigilance, constantly expose the aggressive policies of the imperialist groups, curb their war conspiracies, and resolutely fight for the broad unity of all peace forces.

Gheorghiu-Dej also said that while we are striving to resolve disputes through negotiations and ease international tensions, we must not fail to take into account the existence of the imperialist aggressive groups that are continuing to expand their arms and prepare for war, because they still maintain their military bases and organize provocative attacks on socialist countries.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian People's Republic considers itself an active factor in the struggle to safeguard and defend peace. The Romanian People's Republic has now established diplomatic relations with forty-four countries and has trade relations with more than seventy countries. According to the provisions of the draft directives, Romania's foreign trade volume in 1965 will be doubled compared to 1959.

He said that Romania firmly supports the new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on complete and thorough disarmament, and firmly supports the correct position of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on concluding a German peace treaty and ending the occupation status of West Berlin. The proposals put forward by Romania and other socialist countries on developing cooperation in the Balkan region and establishing a Balkan nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone have become the focus of attention of public opinion in the Balkan countries. The Romanian People's Republic is determined to closely unite with other countries in the socialist camp and fight for lasting world peace.

Gheorghiu-Dej finally said that the decisions to be adopted by the Third Congress of the Party will become a combat program for the Party and all working people, and will stimulate a new upsurge of creative forces throughout the country. The Romanian working class, peasants, and intellectuals are closely united under the glorious banner of the long-tested Party, and with full patriotic enthusiasm, will make ten times the effort to realize the magnificent tasks put forward by the Congress, and will achieve victory in the development and prosperity of our socialist motherland. Completing the magnificent goals set by this Congress, the Romanian people will make their own contributions to winning the competition between the socialist world system and capitalism and to the victory of the forces of peace.

Gheorghiu-Dej's report was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    乔治乌—德治在罗马尼亚党代表大会上作报告
    提出加速社会主义建设的六年计划
    新华社布加勒斯特20日电　罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治，20日在工人党第三次代表大会上作了“关于罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会的工作和1960—1965年国民经济发展计划及经济发展远景规划”的报告。
    乔治乌—德治在报告中指出，罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会将对党的富有成效的多方面的活动、对劳动人民在党的第二次代表大会以来的几年中所取得的杰出成就进行总结，并将提出在罗马尼亚完成社会主义建设的任务。
    乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会以来这段时期的历史性成就证明，从剥削下解放出来的劳动人民具有巨大的创造积极性，他们意识到自己是国家财富的全权主人，并在为自己的福利而劳动。
      社会主义工业生产高速度增加，农业合作化已大体实
  现，五年计划已经在四年内完成
    不断地向社会主义推进，始终如一地实行国家工业化、实行对农业的社会主义改造和文化革命是党的政策的特点。国家的生产力不断增长了，国民经济各方面的社会主义生产关系扩大和巩固了。
    社会主义工业的生产高速度地增加了；建立了许多企业，建立了新的工业部门；提前完成了国家电气化的十年计划，工业在国民经济中的比重正在逐年增加。
    在农业的社会主义改造方面，已经大体上实现了农业合作化。最后的剥削阶级——富农阶级已经消灭；从而在我国永远结束了人对人的剥削。
    现在，整个工业、运输业、商业和财经信贷系统都属于社会主义经济部分，而在农业中，有五分之四的耕地属于社会主义经济部分。
    因此，罗马尼亚人民共和国已经建立了社会主义的经济基础。这是工人阶级、农民和知识分子的伟大胜利。
    乔治乌—德治继续说，劳动人民在建设社会主义的事业中之所以能够取得胜利，是因为我们有正确的舵手——罗马尼亚工人党。忠于战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的我们的党，由于它的正确的政治路线、原则性和战斗性，在召开第三次代表大会的时候，比任何时候更加团结和更加强大，广大的人民群众都坚决地跟随着我们的党。
    报告人接着指出，罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会提出的发展国民经济的任务已经胜利完成。他说，根据初步材料，到1960年年底，工业产值有可能比1955年大约增加67％。而第二次党代表大会的指示原规定增加60％—65％。
    报告人指出，根据一系列最重要的产品产值来看，五年计划已经在四年内完成了。提前一年完成机器制造业的任务是这一时期中我国经济活动中最卓越的成绩之一。1960年，机器制造业的产值将比1955年提高一倍，或者将等于1938年的十倍。
    第二次党代表大会在农业方面提出的任务是争取使社会主义成分在土地面积和商品产量方面占优势，这个任务已经在1959年年底完成了。社会主义成分已经拥有全国耕地面积的81％。农业合作化为进一步增加农产品和畜产品创造了有利条件。
    乔治乌—德治着重指出，国民经济各部门的巨大成就保证了劳动人民生活水平的不断提高。
      六年计划的基本目的是发展社会主义的物质技术基
  础，完成建立起社会主义生产关系的过程
    乔治乌—德治在谈到1960—1965年国民经济的发展计划时着重指出，这一计划的基本目的是发展社会主义的物质技术基础，在整个国民经济中完成建立起社会主义生产关系的过程，以便完成社会主义建设。
    指示草案规定，1965年的工业生产要比1959年增加将近一点一倍。到1965年，将完成农业集体化的过程，并使农产品总值比1959年增加70％—80％，这样就将能保证有丰富的农产品来不断提高人民的生活水平。
    乔治乌—德治接着谈到了1960—1965年期间罗马尼亚交通运输和邮电事业的发展情况，国民经济投资方面的任务，在生产中采用新技术、提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本等问题。他指出，在1960—1965年期间，由国家资金支出的基本投资总额规定为一千七百亿至一千八百亿列伊，这就是说，几乎比过去的六年多一倍。
    乔治乌—德治还谈到提高人民生活水平的问题。他指出，在1960—1965年期间，罗马尼亚的国民收入将增长70％—80％，职工的实际工资将增加40％—45％，农民的收入大约将增加40％。
    乔治乌—德治接着说，六年计划的完成，将向罗马尼亚人民揭开新的、更加光辉的前景，即完成社会主义建设和逐渐向共产主义建设过渡的前景。计划草案规定加强国家的社会主义工业，以便在最短的期限内在按人口平均计算的生产和消费水平方面赶上那些比较发达的国家。
    在最近十五年内，工业生产平均每年增长速度为百分之十二，粮食年产量将达到二千万到二千二百万吨
    乔治乌—德治在谈到国民经济的远景规划时说，分析的结果表明，在最近十五年里，使工业产品总产值增长五倍以上将是可能的。平均每年工业生产增长速度将为12％。他说，在最近十五年里，在正常的气候条件下，粮食年产量将达到二千万到二千二百万吨。到1975年，畜牧业产品将比1959年增长三倍以上。
    党的队伍更加坚强、更加团结在党中央的周围，党对整
  个国家工作、经济、社会文化工作的领导作用正在不断加强
    报告人在谈到关于党的部分时说，今天我们的党比它建立近四十年来的任何时候都更加坚强、更加团结在自己的党中央的周围。在第二次党代会以后的这段时期内，在党员的数量上和质量上、在党的思想工作上、在进一步加强党在组织上和政治上的团结方面，取得了十分显著的成就。截至今年6月1日为止，罗马尼亚工人党共有党员和预备党员八十三万四千六百人，即比1955年增加了40％以上。重要的是，在党员和预备党员的总人数中，有72％以上的人是直接在工业企业和社会主义农业中工作的。由此可见，第二次党代会拟定的保证工人在党内占优势这一任务已经胜利完成了。
    乔治乌—德治谈到了党组织的任务和党在思想、文化方面的活动。他说，今后必需注意严格遵守列宁主义原则吸收党员群众更加积极地参加有关党的政策的主要问题的讨论，开展批评与自我批评、特别是来自下面的有关揭露缺点和错误的批评。
    在争取完成社会主义建设的斗争中，党对整个国家工作、经济、社会文化工作的领导作用正在不断增强。
    他说，必须使资本主义的各种辩护者在哲学、法学、经济学和历史学上的理论受到具有战斗性的科学的批判。
    乔治乌—德治说，党十分重视国际共产主义运动的意识形态的问题。
    反对修正主义者在当代的基本问题上的反马克思主义观点具有特别的意义。南斯拉夫修正主义者否认马克思列宁主义基本原理，仅仅适合社会主义敌人的心意
    他强调指出，反对修正主义者在当代的基本问题上的反马克思主义观点具有特别的意义。
    报告人严厉谴责了南斯拉夫现代修正主义者。他说，修正主义者否认对各国来说具有普遍意义的马克思列宁主义基本原理。修正主义分子攻击的主要目标之一就是关于党的领导作用和社会主义国家作为建设社会主义的工具的列宁主义原理。修正主义者的关于党的取消主义的观点的目的在于解除工人阶级的武装，瓦解工人阶级。这种观点仅仅适合社会主义的敌人的心意。修正主义者过去和将来始终都遭到各国共产党和工人党的最坚决的反击。
    报告人在谈到国际局势时说，党的第二次代表大会以来，国际生活的最重要的特征是社会主义、进步和和平力量的强大增长。在这方面起决定作用的是各社会主义国家取得的成就，各社会主义国家国民经济和文化的强大高涨及其在全世界威信的增长。
    乔治乌—德治说，同其它兄弟党一道，罗马尼亚工人党为不断加强世界共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结的斗争作出了贡献。
    乔治乌—德治谴责了美帝国主义及其在各国的仆从企图阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
    他说，在日本，现在展开了反对美帝国主义奴役日本的声势浩大的群众运动。这一事件使岸信介政府被迫取消了艾森豪威尔总统的访问。
    乔治乌—德治又说，在这一时期中国际共产党和工人党的队伍成长了，他们的团结巩固了。国际反动派及其代理人加紧破坏世界共产主义运动的团结，扰乱与混入世界共产主义运动队伍的阴谋勾当已遭到了决定性的失败，因为他们面对的是各国共产党和工人党之间的牢不可破的团结及其对马克思列宁主义的忠诚。
    乔治乌—德治说，1957年11月在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议上通过的宣言指出，在目前条件下，国际工人运动必须警惕的主要危险是修正主义。在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领中得到了集中表现的现代修正主义，遭到了各国共产党和工人党的坚决而一致的反击。
    坚决打击美帝国主义的侵略行为，是对和平事业的巨大贡献
    乔治乌—德治说，美国的外交政策体现了军国主义和最反动的垄断资本主义的利益，这一政策是与军备竞赛相联系的。给美帝国主义的侵略行为以坚决的打击是对和平事业最现实的和巨大的贡献。
    乔治乌—德治说，侵略是帝国主义的本性。帝国主义极端仇视社会主义阵营，仇视民族解放运动，为了它自己的统治世界的野心，它决不会放弃使用武力的。
    他说，因此，社会主义国家、共产党和工人党一致认为，应当号召人民提高警惕，不断地揭露帝国主义集团的侵略政策，遏制他们的战争阴谋，坚决地为广泛团结一切和平力量而斗争。
    乔治乌—德治又说，我们在为争取通过谈判解决争端和缓和国际紧张局势的同时，绝不能不考虑到正在继续进行扩军备战的帝国主义侵略集团的存在，因为他们仍然保持着他们的军事基地，组织对社会主义国家的挑衅性攻击。
    乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚人民共和国认为自己是在维护和保卫和平的斗争中的一个积极因素。罗马尼亚人民共和国现在同四十四个国家建立外交关系，同七十多个国家有贸易往来。根据指示草案的规定，1965年罗马尼亚的对外贸易额将比1959年增加一倍。
    他说，罗马尼亚坚决支持苏联提出的关于全面彻底裁军的新建议，坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领地位的正确立场。罗马尼亚和其它社会主义国家提出的关于发展巴尔干地区的合作和建立巴尔干无核武器和火箭武器地区的建议，已成为巴尔干地区国家的舆论注意的中心。罗马尼亚人民共和国决定同社会主义阵营其它国家密切团结，为实现世界的持久和平而斗争。
    乔治乌—德治最后说，党的第三次代表大会将通过的决定，将成为党和全体劳动人民的战斗纲领，将激起全国的创造性的力量的新高涨。罗马尼亚工人阶级、农民、知识分子紧密地团结在久经考验的党的光荣旗帜下，怀着满腔的爱国热情，将以十倍的努力来实现代表大会提出的宏伟任务，将在我们社会主义祖国的发展和繁荣中取得胜利。完成这次代表大会所制定的宏伟目标，罗马尼亚人民就将对社会主义世界体系同资本主义进行的竞赛中取得胜利方面、在和平力量取得胜利方面作出自己的贡献。
    乔治乌—德治的报告不断为全场热烈的掌声所打断。
