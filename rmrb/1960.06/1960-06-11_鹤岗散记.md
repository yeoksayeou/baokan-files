Random Notes from Hegang
Bai Yuan, Text Fang Cheng, Illustration

Comrade Zhao Deben, the First Secretary of the Hegang People's Commune Dongshan Coal Mine Party Committee, is thirty-two years old, which makes him a relatively young Party Secretary among those holding similar positions. After the Hegang People's Commune was established in September 1958, it was divided into economic zones based on the various coal mines. Comrade Zhao Deben also served as the Party Secretary of the Dongshan Economic Zone of the People's Commune.

Speaking of the situation after the establishment of the People's Commune, Comrade Zhao Deben said with great enthusiasm: "As soon as the commune was established, I implemented the unified leadership of the Party Committee, with the secretary taking the lead. I immediately mobilized all the masses in the entire economic zone, mobilizing more than 10,000 people to build roads and houses… Hmph, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I really wouldn't have known how great the power of the masses is! Everyone carried a few bricks and tiles, and in a few days, they built a tall building…" Just as Comrade Zhao Deben said, the former barren mountains and fields are now covered with houses, and many new mine shafts were built by the masses during the mass movement after the establishment of the People's Commune. Among the various coal mines in Hegang, the Dongshan Mine has the oldest history. In the past, the Dongshan Mine only had two old coal mines that had been mined for more than thirty years. As soon as the commune was established, the masses opened twenty-two small shafts. Now the small shafts have become large shafts. The entire Dongshan Mine produces 8,000 tons of coal per day, of which 6,000 tons are from the new shafts. Coal mines and open-pit coal mines of various sizes like the Dongshan Mine, opened by the masses, can be found everywhere in the entire Hegang People's Commune. Comrade Zhao Deben counted their "family assets" for us: Now, in their economic zone, there are more than 1,000 pigs, more than 34,000 chickens and ducks, 120 dairy cows, 320 dairy goats, 150 head of beef cattle, two large fish farms 40 meters wide and 2,500 meters long, raising more than 10 million fish, 40,000 square meters of glass greenhouses producing vegetables in all seasons, as well as bees, silkworms, rabbits, and 150 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of vegetable fields. They have already bought a total of three tractors participating in production, and Comrade Zhao Deben said: "The fourth one will arrive tomorrow. By the end of the year, our tractors will be able to cultivate 1,000 hectares of wasteland. As for coal, there's no need to mention it. As long as the technical revolution in coal mining is carried out, there will be no need for people to mine coal. Just let the coal flow automatically from the mine shaft to the ground."

If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes, just listening to the Party Secretary say this, we would have thought it was just his beautiful ideal. But we did see it with our own eyes: piles of coal, as high as mountains, flowing automatically from underground to the ground; automatic tunneling machines assembled with steel, which start whirring and operating automatically as soon as the electricity is turned on; electric winches, controlled by electricity, rumble down into the coal mine, fill up with coal, and then drill out from the mine… And all of this is controlled and operated by an electric control panel on the ground. This is a small room, with a control panel about the size of a small desk. A person sits in front of the control panel, turns on various buttons to start the machines in the mine, and can see the automatic operation of various machines and the progress of tunneling from the various red and green indicator lights on the control panel. Among the many flashing indicator lights, a flowing light moves quickly along the inclined track, like a shooting star flying across the colorful sky. That is the situation of the underground coal flying out of the formation on the automatic winch…

The coal buried underground flies out of the ground with the dreams of mankind, and the dreams of mankind being realized present a charming scene on the land of the People's Commune. The Hegang People's Commune, composed mainly of large coal mines, has crisscrossing mine shafts and towering derricks. Surrounded by various mining areas, Hegang City is built on a rolling mountain range, like a dazzling island floating from the vast sea of coal. Various factories, schools, kindergartens, public canteens… established by the commune resound with the sounds of happy life. And in the picture drawn by Comrade Zhao Deben's words, beyond the smoky, derrick-lined coal mining area, in the distance of the city, under the white cloud-covered sky, are scattered the commune's pig farms, dairy farms, tens of thousands of chickens and ducks singing together, the shimmering large fish farms floating with the shadows of passing clouds, and the flocks of sheep and cattle grazing on the hillside. Following the location of the tractors, there is an endless, developing commune's farmland… On the entire land of the People's Commune, it is impossible to distinguish where the city is and where the countryside is. A long train is coming from afar. The endless train puffs steam and roars, day and night coming from afar, fully loaded with coal from Hegang. What a huge change has taken place in people's lives.

In the past, a train carrying coal would come to Hegang from other places, stop at the railway junction station, and the coal transported from various coal mines would be transported to the junction station through the crisscrossing railways of each coal mine. After completing the transfer formalities with the junction station, the coal was loaded onto the train at the junction station. In this way, a train from other places would often have to stay at the junction station for thirteen or fourteen hours to transport the coal out. Now, the commune has unified the transportation of the entire mining area, dismantled the redundant rails that crisscrossed in the past, and connected the railways of the various coal mines to build a ring railway around Hegang City. The former junction station has been cancelled, and a unified large station has been newly built. Trains coming from other places no longer need to stop at the junction station for transfer, but go directly to the large coal storage yards of various coal mines along the ring railway, load the coal full at once, and pull it away. On the day the ring railway was opened to traffic, the spring breeze in May blew whistlingly throughout Hegang City. A locomotive decorated with red silk and colored ribbons pulled a train of forty-five coal-loaded carriages to the station of the ring railway. The masses of the commune who came to participate in the opening ceremony beat gongs and drums. The sounds of people, gongs and drums, music broadcast by loudspeakers, and the jetting of the locomotive mixed into a crashing roar in the whistling spring breeze. The leaders of the commune cut the ribbon for the train. A young driver on the locomotive blew the whistle. The sound of the roaring whistle lasted for a long time, followed by a rumbling sound, and the train started. A long train entered a large coal storage yard from the ring railway. Forty or fifty carriages, one after another, disappeared all at once, all hidden in the coal storage yard. Only the towering coal storage yard faces the blue sky. Looking up, it seems as if it is about to pour down on your head. At this time, the large funnel aimed at each carriage in the coal storage yard is opened, and the giant stream of coal flows down from the funnel, filling each carriage at the same time. Then the locomotive gave a short cry, beat a soft rhythm of clicking sounds, and drove far away. The train carries coal, bringing warmth to the world. We stand on the ring railway of the commune, watching the departing train, thinking about the dreams of mankind being realized. (Attached pictures)

[The large coal storage yard shows its skills for the first time - the loading time is reduced from one and a half hours to load one carriage in the past to one hour to load forty-five carriages.]
[After the establishment of the People's Commune, new small mines like this, without state investment, are everywhere.]
[New equipment in the mine - electric production command platform.]

    鹤岗散记
    白原  文  方成  画
    鹤岗人民公社东山煤矿的党委第一书记赵德本同志，三十二岁的年纪，在担任党委书记这一类职务的人们当中，算是一位比较年青的党委书记。鹤岗人民公社在1958年9月间建立以后，以各个煤矿为主体划分为各个经济区，于是赵德本同志同时担任了人民公社东山经济区的党委书记。
    谈起建立人民公社以后的情景，赵德本同志眉飞色舞地说：“公社一成立，我就实行党委统一领导，书记挂帅，一下子把整个经济区的群众通通发动起来，调动一万多人修马路、盖房子……嗬，要不是亲眼看见，真不知道群众的力量究竟有多大！一个人拿几块砖瓦，几天的功夫就盖起一座高楼大厦……”正像赵德本同志所说的一样，过去的荒山野坝，现在盖满了房子，许多新矿井都是人民公社建立以后在群众运动中建设起来的。在鹤岗的各个煤矿当中，东山矿的历史算是最老的了。过去，东山矿只有两个已经开采了三十多年的老煤井。公社一建立，群众一动手就开了二十二个小井，现在小井变成了大井，整个东山矿每天产煤八千吨，新井开采的就是六千吨。像东山矿这样的由群众动手开出来的大大小小的煤井和露天煤矿，在整个鹤岗人民公社到处都是。赵德本同志向我们数了数他们的“家底”；现在在他们经济区一共有猪一千多头，鸡鸭三万四千多只，奶牛一百二十头，奶羊三百二十只，菜牛一百五十头，两个四十米宽、二千五百米长的大养鱼场，养鱼一千多万尾，四季生产蔬菜的玻璃温室四万平方米，此外还有蜜蜂、蚕、兔，还有一百五十垧（每垧十五亩）菜地，已经在地里参加生产的拖拉机一共买了三部，而且，赵德本同志说：“第四部明天就到了。到年底，我们的拖拉机就可以开出一千垧荒地。煤，那就不用说了，只要煤矿的技术革命一开展，采煤不用人，只管叫煤炭从矿井下自动往地面上淌就是。”
    如果不是亲自看见的话，只是听党委书记这么说，一定以为这只能是他自己的一种美妙的理想。但是我们的确亲自看见了：那是一堆堆像山一样高的由地下自动淌到地上来的煤块；这是用钢铁装配起来的自动掘进机，只要一通上电流，机器就哗哗地转动着，自动操作起来；用电流操纵的自动绞车轰隆隆地钻到煤井下面去，装满煤炭又从井下钻出来……而所有这一切，都是通过地面上的一台电动操纵台来指挥和操纵的。这是一间小小的房子，像一张小书桌差不多大小的操纵台就设在这里。一个人坐在操纵台前，打开各种电钮把井下的机器开动以后，从操纵台上各种红绿指示灯可以看见各种机器自动操作的情况，可以看见井下掘进的进度，而在许多闪亮的指示灯当中，一颗流动的亮光沿着倾斜的轨道飞快地在流动，就像是在五彩缤纷的天空中飞过的流星，那是地下的煤炭在自动绞车上飞出地层的情况……
    埋藏在地下的煤炭带着人类的梦想飞出了地面，正在实现的人类的梦想在人民公社的土地上出现了一幅迷人的景象。以各个大煤矿为主体组成的鹤岗人民公社，煤井纵横，井架林立。在各个矿区环绕的当中，鹤岗城建立在一片起伏的山岗上，好像从茫茫的煤海中浮起的一座光艳夺目的岛屿。由公社建立起来的各种大大小小的工厂、学校、幼儿园、公共食堂……响彻着一片欢乐的生活的音响。而在赵德本同志用语言所勾画的图画上，越过那一片烟雾腾腾，井架林立的煤矿区，在城市的远方，在白云皑皑的天空下，散布着公社的养猪场、奶牛场，几万只几万只的鸡鸭在一起大合唱，碧波粼粼的大养鱼场里飘荡着来去的云影，在山坡上蠕动的是放牧的羊群和牛群，顺着那一部部拖拉机所在的地方望过去，那是一片无边无际的、正在开辟的公社的田园……在整个人民公社的土地上，分不开哪里是城市，哪里是农村。一列长长的火车从远方开过来了。不绝的火车喷着汽，吼叫着，日日夜夜从远方开过来，满载着煤炭从鹤岗开出去。在人们的生活里，发生了多么巨大的变化呵。
    过去，一列运煤的火车从外地开到鹤岗来，停在铁路的交接站里，从各个煤矿运出的煤通过各个煤矿自己的纵横交错的铁路运到交接站来，和交接站办妥交接的手续，然后把煤装到交接站的火车上。这样，一列外地的火车开到鹤岗来，往往要在交接站停留十三、四个小时才能把煤运出去。现在公社把整个矿区的运输统一起来，把过去纵横交错的那些多余的铁轨拆掉，同时把各个煤矿的铁路连接起来，环绕着鹤岗城修起了一条环行铁路。过去的交接站取消了，新建了一个统一的大车站。从外地开来的火车不用再停留在交接站里交接，沿着环行铁路一直开到各个煤矿的大储煤仓里，一下子把煤装满就拉走了。环行铁路通车的那一天，5月的春风在整个鹤岗城刮得呼呼地响。一部披红挂彩的机车拉着一列四十五个车厢的装煤的列车开到环行铁路的站头上，赶来参加通车典礼的公社的群众敲打着锣鼓，人声，锣鼓声，扩音喇叭播送的乐声，机车的喷气声，在呼呼的春风中混成了一片哗哗的巨响。公社的领导同志为火车剪了彩。机车上的一位年青的司机拉响了汽笛。吼叫着的汽笛的声音一直响了好久好久，接着轰隆隆一声，火车开动了。长长的一列火车从环行铁路开进了一座大储煤仓里，一节连着一节的四、五十个车厢一下都不见了，通通隐没在储煤仓里了。只见高耸的储煤仓顶着蓝天，仰头一看，就像要向你头上倾倒下来一样。这时候，储煤仓里把对准每节车厢的大漏斗一打开，煤的巨流哗哗地从漏斗淌下来，一下子把每节车厢同时装满。于是机车短促地叫了一声，打着咔喳喳咔喳喳的柔软的节拍，一直向远方开走了。火车带着煤炭，给人间带去温暖。我们站在公社的环行铁路上，望着远去的火车，想着正在实现的人类的梦想。（附图片）
