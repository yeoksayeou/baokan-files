Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke traitorous group in Japan, defying the world's condemnation, brazenly announced at midnight on the 18th that the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty had been "naturally passed" by the Japanese Diet's House of Councillors. In doing so, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have placed another noose around their own necks.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Kiina Etsusaburo, issued a statement at midnight yesterday, making this announcement which violates the interests of the Japanese nation. In this statement, the Kishi Nobusuke government once again expressed its willingness to act as a pawn of U.S. aggression, declaring that "cooperation with the free world has always been the foundation of Japanese diplomacy," and that "the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is a fundamental part of Japanese policy." The statement also obsequiously stated that the conclusion of this aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will make the relationship between the U.S. and Japan "even closer".

In this statement, the Kishi Nobusuke government once again resorted to the deceptive tricks that have long been seen through by the Japanese people, concealing the treaty's aggressive nature and its harm to the interests of the Japanese nation and Asian peace. It also reversed black and white, claiming that "those who oppose this treaty are only a minority."

But on the very day that the Kishi Nobusuke group was spreading these outrageous lies, hundreds of thousands of people in Tokyo angrily surrounded the Diet, raising their arms and shouting: "We do not recognize the new Security Treaty!" "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" Tens of thousands of people surrounded Kishi Nobusuke's Prime Minister's residence all night, "making Kishi Nobusuke, in effect, a prisoner after the Japan-U.S. Joint Security Treaty was naturally passed." United Press International also had to lament that although Kishi Nobusuke made the treaty "naturally passed", "he personally suffered the most heartbreaking defeat."

The Kishi Nobusuke group used fascist violence at midnight on May 19th, driving away opposition party members and illegally "passing" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives alone. Since then, it has been trying to force the House of Councillors to "resolve" the treaty as well. However, the Kishi Nobusuke group's fascist atrocities have aroused an even stronger and more violent anti-American and anti-Kishi storm among the Japanese people. Tens of thousands of angry people have surrounded the Diet for days, resolutely opposing the Kishi Nobusuke group's attempt to force the Diet to "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Under these circumstances, the Kishi Nobusuke group implemented "natural passage" without deliberation by the House of Councillors.

The Kishi Nobusuke group relied on illegal means to complete the formalities of the Diet "passing" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and is preparing to exchange instruments of ratification quickly after the U.S. Senate "passes" the treaty, so that the treaty will "take effect."

The Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kawashima Shojiro, clamored in a statement that the Diet would not be dissolved and the cabinet would not resign en masse until the new "Security Treaty" ratification procedures were completed and took effect.

However, the Japanese people have declared this treaty invalid and not binding on them in any way.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to collude with the U.S. military stationed in Japan to suppress the Japanese people and interfere in Japan's political situation.

According to Axel Bank, a Tokyo correspondent for United Press International, on the 18th, Kishi Nobusuke described the anti-American and anti-Kishi mass movement as a "international communist movement" instigated by foreign countries in order "to pave the way for declaring a full-scale state of emergency, thereby enabling him to request U.S. intervention."

This reporter, colluding with Kishi Nobusuke to jointly suppress the Japanese people's patriotic struggle, sought "grounds" for U.S. imperialism to interfere in Japan's internal affairs, saying: "Technically speaking, under the old (Japan-U.S.) Security Treaty, the Japanese government has the right to request the U.S. military to help suppress large-scale riots and disturbances in Japan caused by the instigation and interference of one or more foreign countries."

It is reported that the Kishi Nobusuke government has begun to arrest trade union leaders participating in the anti-American patriotic struggle. Matsuda, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, Nakamura, a member of the Trade Union Federation, and five other trade union members who participated in the large-scale demonstration against Eisenhower's Press Secretary Hagerty on June 10, were arrested on the 18th.

    充当帮凶卖国到底　自套绞索加速灭亡
    岸信介集团宣布日美条约“自然成立”
    反动政府阴谋勾结驻日美军镇压人民爱国运动
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介卖国集团甘冒天下之大不韪，在18日午夜悍然宣布侵略性日美军事同盟条约在日本国会参议院“自然通过”。这样，美日反动派就为它们自己又套上了一道绞索。
    岸信介政府的内阁官房长官椎名悦三郎昨天午夜发表声明，作出了这个违背日本民族利益的宣布。在这项声明中，岸信介政府再次表示甘心充当美国侵略的鹰犬，宣称
  “同自由世界的合作一直是日本外交的基础”，“日美安全条约是日本政策的一个基本部分”。声明并且奴颜卑膝地说：通过这项侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，将使日美“两国关系更加密切”。
    岸信介政府在这项声明中再次玩弄早已被日本人民看穿了的欺骗伎俩，掩饰这个条约的侵略本质和对日本民族利益与亚洲和平的危害。它并且颠倒黑白地说什么“反对这项条约的人只是少数”。
    但是就在岸信介集团进行这种漫天大谎的当天，东京数十万群众愤怒地包围国会，振臂高呼：“不承认新安全条约！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”。数万群众通宵包围岸信介的首相官邸，“使得岸信介在美日共同安全条约自然通过后实际上成为一个囚徒”。美国合众国际社也不得不哀叹地说：岸信介虽然使条约“自然通过”，但是“他个人受到最痛心的失败”。
    岸信介集团曾经在5月19日午夜施用法西斯暴力，赶走在野党议员，非法地在众议院单独“通过”日美军事同盟条约。以后它一直企图也强使参议院“议决”这个条约。但是，岸信介集团的法西斯暴行激起了日本人民更加强大和猛烈的反美反岸风暴，数以万计的愤怒群众连日包围国会，坚决反对岸信介集团强使国会“通过”日美军事同盟条约。在这种形势下，岸信介集团就在没有经过参议院审议的情况下实行“自然通过”。
    岸信介集团依赖非法的手段完成了国会“通过”日美军事同盟条约的手续，并且准备在美国参议院“通过”这个条约后迅速地交换批准书，使这个条约“生效”。
    自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎发表谈话叫嚷说，在新“安全条约”批准手续完成并且生效之前，不解散国会，也不实行内阁总辞职。
    但是，日本人民已经宣布这个条约无效，并对他们没有任何约束力。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府正企图同驻日美军勾结一道，来镇压日本人民，干涉日本的政局。
    据“合众国际社”驻东京记者阿克塞耳班克18日透露，岸信介所以把反美反岸的群众运动说成是受外国指使的“国际共产主义运动”，是“为宣布全面紧急状态，从而使他能够要求美国进行干涉铺平道路”。
    这个记者为美国帝国主义干涉日本内政，同岸信介勾结起来共同镇压日本人民爱国斗争寻找“根据”，他说：“从技术上来讲，根据旧的（日美）安全条约，日本政府有权要求美国军队帮助镇压由于一个或几个外国之煽动和干涉而在日本引起的大规模暴动的骚动”。
    据报道，岸信介政府已经开始逮捕参加反美爱国斗争的工会负责人。6月10日参加反对艾森豪威尔新闻秘书哈格蒂大示威的日本钢铁产业工会联合会议长松田、工会联合会委员中村和其他五名工会会员，已经在18日被捕。
