Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on June 3rd: Soviet Premier Khrushchev made a statement at a press conference on June 3rd regarding the Soviet government’s new proposals on the basic provisions of a treaty on general and complete disarmament. The Soviet government's new proposals have been sent to the heads of government of all countries.

More than 400 journalists from Soviet and foreign newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and television stations attended the press conference held in the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government formulated this proposal in order to submit it to the Paris Summit for discussion. Unfortunately, the U.S. government, through its provocative actions, undermined the summit, and we were unable to discuss the issue of general and complete disarmament and other important international issues in Paris. Khrushchev pointed out that the investigation conducted by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee "once again very clearly proved that the destruction of the summit was planned and implemented by the U.S. government—Herter, Nixon, and Eisenhower."

Khrushchev then elaborated on the Soviet government's new proposal on general and complete disarmament.

Subsequently, Khrushchev allowed reporters to ask questions of interest to them.

A reporter asked Khrushchev how he viewed Marshal Malinovsky's statement that he had ordered that any base from which aircraft took off to violate the airspace of the Soviet Union and socialist countries would be struck. The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers replied that the words of the Soviet Minister of Defense should be understood literally. Khrushchev said he had made it very clear that if foreign aircraft intruded into our borders, they would be shot down.

Khrushchev emphasized that the bases from which these aircraft took off would be struck. He said the Defense Minister's order would be strictly enforced. We ask that serious conclusions be drawn from this.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has the ability to punish those who commit aggression.

Someone asked Khrushchev what he thought of White's statement that the United States would fulfill its obligations to its allies.

Khrushchev replied that he thought the statement was stupid. It shows that the United States stands on its old position and continues to insist on the right to conduct spy flights. This statement by the United States seems to be saying to its allies: Don't be afraid, if the Soviet Union is going to crush bases on your territory, we will come and bury you in the future.

That is to say, the United States hopes that its allies will bleed for American acts of aggression.

In answering a question about whether there was a veto in the supervisory bodies stipulated in the new Soviet proposal, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union put forward a disarmament proposal and did not mention amending the United Nations Charter at all. The strength and wisdom of this charter lies in the veto power.

Someone asked Khrushchev: What does he think of the Western claims that the summit may not be held for six to eight months?

The head of the Soviet government emphasized that this meeting is not only needed by the Soviet Union, but also by all countries. If anyone thinks that postponing the summit also means postponing the settlement of the German peace treaty, they are wrong.

Khrushchev said that we cannot wait forever for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. When we see that the time has passed, we will hold a meeting with socialist countries and invite all countries that wish to sign a German peace treaty to sign a treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev said that in this way, the West Berlin issue will be resolved, and the Western countries' right of occupation in West Berlin will disappear.

Someone asked Khrushchev if he believed that war was inevitable as long as imperialism existed. The head of the Soviet government replied that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had clearly stated this issue, and our view that war is not inevitable has not changed in the slightest. On the contrary, life has just confirmed this.

In answering another question, Khrushchev said that he still has an optimistic attitude towards the development of the international situation and believes that if the people of all countries take the cause of maintaining peace into their own hands and restrain reckless aggressors, then peace will be guaranteed.

Khrushchev expressed his conviction that the vast majority of residents of the United States also advocate peace and are indignant at the provocative actions of the U.S. government.

Someone asked Khrushchev: Does he believe that despite the breakdown of the summit, trade and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries can still be further developed?

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers expressed his conviction that Soviet-American relations will improve. He also pointed out that the Soviet Union's trade ties with Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany are developing well.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union will now and in the future make every effort to expand this connection. However, this also depends on our counterparts.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet-American cultural exchange program is being implemented, and all the planned mutual visits are taking place. The head of the Soviet government emphasized that the situation created by the aggressive forces should not be used to worsen trade and cultural ties.

The press conference was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

    在克里姆林宫斯维尔德洛夫大厅
    赫鲁晓夫答记者问
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫3日在记者招待会上就苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的新建议发表了声明，苏联政府的新建议已经分别送交世界各国政府首脑。
    苏联和外国报纸、通讯社、电台和电视台的四百多名记者出席了在克里姆林宫斯维尔德洛夫大厅举行的记者招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府制定出这个建议，是为了把它提交巴黎政府首脑会议讨论。遗憾的是，美国政府以自己的挑衅行动破坏了最高级会议，因而我们未能在巴黎讨论全面彻底裁军问题和其他国际重要问题。赫鲁晓夫指出，美国参议院外交委员会所进行的调查工作，“再次非常明显地证明了，破坏最高级会议是美国政府——赫脱、尼克松、艾森豪威尔所策划和实行的”。
    赫鲁晓夫接着阐述了苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的新建议。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫就让记者提出他们所感兴趣的问题。
    有记者问赫鲁晓夫如何看待马利诺夫斯基元帅关于他已下令只要苏联和社会主义国家的领空遭到侵犯就打击飞机起飞的基地的声明。苏联部长会议主席回答说，应该一字不差地理解苏联国防部长的话。赫鲁晓夫说，他说得非常清楚，如果外国飞机侵入我们的国境，它们将被击落。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，将打击这些飞机起飞的基地。他说，国防部长的命令将严格执行。我们要求从中得出认真的结论。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联有可能惩罚那些进行侵略的人。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫对怀特关于美国将履行它对盟国的义务的声明有什么看法。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，他认为这个声明是愚蠢的。它表明，美国站在老立场上，继续坚持进行间谍飞行的权利。美国这个声明似乎是对它的盟国这样说：不要害怕，如果苏联要粉碎你们领土上的基地，我们将来给你们送葬。
    这就是说，美国希望它的盟国为美国的侵略行动流血。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答关于在苏联新建议规定的监督机构中有无否决权的问题时说，苏联提出的是裁军建议，一点也没有谈到修改联合国宪章，这个宪章的力量和英明之处就在于否决权。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫：他对西方所流传的关于最高级会议可能在六至八个月后举行不成的说法有什么看法。
    苏联政府首脑着重指出，这个会议不仅苏联需要，而且也是所有国家需要。如果有人以为，延期举行最高级会议也意味着延期解决对德和约问题，那他们就想错了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不能永远等待对德和约的缔结。当我们看到时期已过的时候，我们将同社会主义国家举行会议，并邀请所有希望签订对德和约的国家，来同德意志民主共和国签订条约。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这样，西柏林问题就将解决，西方国家在西柏林的占领权就将消失。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫，他是否认为，既然有帝国主义存在，战争就不可避免。苏联政府首脑回答说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对这个问题已经明确阐明，我们关于战争不是不可避免的看法毫无改变，相反，生活刚好证实这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答另一个问题时说，他仍旧对国际局势的发展抱乐观态度，并且认为，如果各国人民把维护和平事业掌握在自己手中，并约束轻举妄动的侵略者，那么和平是会得到保证的。
    赫鲁晓夫表示确信，美国绝大多数居民也主张和平，并且对美国政府的挑衅性行动表示愤慨。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫：他是否认为，尽管最高级会议破裂，苏联和西方国家之间仍旧可以进一步发展贸易和文化关系？
    部长会议主席表示确信，苏美关系将会改善。他还指出，苏联同英国、法国、意大利、西德的贸易联系发展得不坏。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联现在和将来都要尽一切努力来扩大这种联系。但是，这同样也取决于我们的对方。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联和美国文化交流计划正在执行，所规定的一切互相访问正在进行。苏联政府首脑着重指出，不应当利用侵略势力所造成的情势，来使贸易和文化联系恶化。
    记者招待会是由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯担任主席的。
