North Korean Economists Discuss Ways to Transition from Cooperative Ownership to Ownership by the Whole People

The agricultural cooperativization movement in North Korea developed rapidly. In the short span of four or five years after the war, the task of cooperativization was successfully completed. In October 1958, all cooperatives in a *ri* (township) were merged into one cooperative. The movement to merge cooperatives brought the cooperative economy into a new stage of development. Under this situation, the theoretical question of how to transition from agricultural cooperative ownership to ownership by the whole people has become a theoretical question of increasing concern to the economic academic community.

The North Korean economic academic community held two discussion meetings on this issue last year. The first was held on April 28, hosted by the Institute of Economics of the Korean Academy of Sciences; the second was held on September 5, convened by the Department of Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences. Based on the speeches at the first discussion meeting and the articles published in "Economic Research" after the meeting, there seem to be two different opinions regarding the path of transition between the two forms of ownership. One advocates continuing to improve the level of cooperative ownership, and in the future adopting the form of a "county alliance" to gradually integrate cooperative ownership into ownership by the whole people; the other advocates transitioning by transforming cooperatives into state-owned farms in stages during the socialist stage, and implementing a unified national wage system.

The former view was put forward by the economist Hong Da-sun (transliteration). Hong Da-sun believes that in the process of the two forms of ownership approaching each other, the public accumulation fund of agricultural cooperatives will become its economic foundation. The continuous increase of the public accumulation fund is the process of the two forms of ownership gradually approaching each other. This is because the public accumulation fund of North Korean agricultural cooperatives is formed with the direct help of the state, and by its nature, contains elements of the whole people. With the growth of the public accumulation fund, the collective economy of cooperatives based on public property increasingly plays a function with the significance of the whole people. Hong Da-sun believes that the essential difference between the two forms of ownership lies in the different scope of ownership of the means of production and the different distribution of products. These two differences can only disappear by expanding the national function performed by the cooperative economy in the ownership of the means of production and unifying the distribution of products nationwide. The establishment of a "county alliance" of cooperatives is of great significance for accelerating the realization of this process, because the "county alliance" can regulate the funds jointly accumulated by various cooperatives and implement a unified wage level. Hong Da-sun believes that the difference between the two forms of ownership can only disappear in the advanced stage of communism. This is because at present, agricultural cooperatives still have the distribution of differential land rent, and people are still concerned about material interests.

Some other scholars disagree with Hong Da-sun's view. They believe that even before reaching the advanced stage of communism, the transition to ownership by the whole people can be completed by merging agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms.

They believe that with the rapid development of productive forces, the preconditions for the gradual transition of North Korea's cooperative economy to ownership by the whole people are maturing. First, the cooperative's public accumulation fund is not only the economic foundation for the transition from cooperative ownership to ownership by the whole people, but also has a strong national character in itself. With the continuous increase of the public accumulation fund, it will be able to play a national function more and more, gradually reducing the differences between the two forms of ownership. Second, as the collective economy continues to grow and the scope of agricultural management becomes wider and wider, the individual sideline occupations of the members become more and more meaningless. Third, the production links and various forms of cooperation between cooperatives are developing more extensively, and the level of socialization of collective ownership is significantly improving, which makes the cooperative economy closer to ownership by the whole people. Fourth, with the development of the agricultural technology revolution, the combination of the cooperative's means of production and the state's and the people's means of production is more extensive. The state provides materials and technology, and the cooperative provides labor, so that agricultural labor is gradually transformed into industrial labor. Fifth, the difference between the living standards of workers and peasants in North Korea is not very large. Therefore, in the disposal of cooperative products, in addition to retaining enough rations for the members and part of the food, the remaining part is purchased and processed by the state, which is further approaching the possibility of implementing a unified national wage system.

They believe that the basic way for cooperatives to transform into state-owned farms is not only does not hinder the development of productive forces, but also promotes its development, as long as it starts from the following principles. First, accelerate the exertion of economic advantages and make full use of its advantages; the transformation to state-owned farms must be carried out gradually and in stages. Second, it must not affect the development of productive forces and reduce the state's financial expenditure to the necessary minimum. Third, not reduce the original income of farmers.

At the second discussion meeting on September 5, the speakers conducted a heated debate on the issue of the transition between the two forms of ownership. Hong Da-sun still insisted on his view. He believes that although comprehensive economic units of the whole county that merge cooperatives into state-owned farms, such as Ongjin County and Ryongyon County, have been formed in the rural areas of North Korea, the state-owned economic components in these two counties accounted for an overwhelming advantage when they were merged into state-owned comprehensive farms. From a national perspective, the number of counties with state-owned economy in an overwhelming advantage, such as Ongjin County and Ryongyon County, is roughly calculated to be about 20, that is, only 15% of the total number of counties in the country. Therefore, the methods of these two counties cannot be universally adopted for the transition. He believes that agricultural cooperative ownership should be basically retained, and rely on the vitality of the cooperative economy, make full use of all internal potentials, and with the help of state investment, to improve the level of cooperative ownership. He believes that one should not simply rely on the state's additional investment to transform all agricultural cooperative ownership into state ownership, because doing so cannot but affect the development of industry, especially the priority development of heavy industry, thereby slowing down the growth rate of production in various sectors of the national economy.

At this meeting, most scholars talked about the issue of differential land rent. They believe that the existence of differential land rent in the rural economy will indeed affect the transformation of ownership, but one cannot therefore believe that the path of "transformation" is unreasonable. Differential land rent has no direct relationship with the principle of distribution according to work, and it is not necessary in the socialist stage. At present, the state has taken various measures to regulate differential land rent and eliminate the side effects of differential land rent. For example, increasing the scope of agricultural tax, the graded difference in irrigation usage fees and cultivation fees, the regional acquisition of agricultural products, especially the completion of water conservancy and the vigorous development of agricultural mechanization, will gradually eliminate the material basis for creating differential land rent.

Regarding the socio-economic nature of the comprehensive farms established in Ongjin County and Ryongyon County, according to the survey materials, some people believe that it is a comprehensive large-scale enterprise organization. It is different from general state-owned enterprises that specialize in production. It includes a variety of operations such as industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, and is closely integrated with the county's culture, education, health, and health care departments. However, the means of production and all products are wholly owned by the state, and a unified wage system of distribution according to work is universally implemented, which eliminates the difference between workers and peasants. The establishment of comprehensive farms is a bold attempt to transition from agricultural cooperative ownership to ownership by the whole people, and to accumulate experience for the transition from socialism to communism.

### 朝鲜经济学界探讨  合作社所有制向全民所有制过渡的途径问题

    朝鲜经济学界探讨
    合作社所有制向全民所有制过渡的途径问题
    朝鲜的农业合作化运动发展很快，在战后短短的四、五年间，便胜利地完成了合作化的工作。1958年10月，又以里（乡）为单位，将全里的合作社并为一社。并社运动的结果使合作社经济进入一个新的发展阶段。在这种形势下，关于从农业合作社所有制向全民所有制过渡的途径问题，就成为经济学界日益关心的理论问题了。
    朝鲜经济学界去年先后共举行过两次关于这个问题的讨论会。第一次在4月28日，由朝鲜科学院经济研究所主持；第二次在9月5日，由科学院社会科学部召开。根据第一次讨论会上的发言和会后发表在“经济研究”上的文章看来，对两种所有制过渡的途径问题归纳起来有两种不同的意见。一种主张继续提高合作社所有制水平，将来采用“郡联盟”的形式，逐渐使合作社所有制融合为全民所有制；一种主张在社会主义阶段，就分期地将合作社转化为国营农场，用实行全国统一工资的办法来实行过渡。
    前一种主张是经济学家洪达善（译音）提出来的。洪达善认为两种所有制接近的过程中，农业合作社的公积金将成为它的经济基础。公积金的不断增加过程，就是两种所有制逐渐接近的过程。这是由于朝鲜农业社的公积金是在国家直接帮助下形成的，按其性质来说，包含有全民性的要素。随着公积金的增长，以公共财产为基础的合作社集体经济愈来愈起着带有全民意义的职能。洪达善认为，两种所有制之间的本质差别在于生产资料所有范围的不同和对产品分配的不同。只有扩大合作社经济在生产资料所有制中执行的全民性的职能，并且在全国范围内统一分配产品，这两种差别才能消失。成立合作社的“郡联盟”对加速实现这一过程有重要的意义，因为“郡联盟”能够调节各个合作社共同积累的资金，实行统一的工资水平。洪达善认为，两种所有制的差别只有在共产主义高级阶段，才能消失。这是由于目前农业合作社还存在着级差地租的分配，人们还关心物质利益。
    另外一些学者不同意洪达善的看法。他们认为即使在还未到达共产主义高级阶段之前，也可以通过农业合作社和国营农场合并的方法来完成向全民所有制的过渡。
    他们认为，随着生产力的飞跃发展，朝鲜合作社经济逐步向全民所有制过渡的先决条件正在成熟。一、合作社的公积金不仅是由合作社所有制向全民所有制过渡的经济基础，而且本身也具有浓厚的全民性。随着公积金的不断增大，它就愈能发挥全民性的职能，逐渐减少两种所有制间的差异。二、由于集体经济不断地增长，农业经营的范围日益广阔，社员个人的副业就更加失去意义。三、合作社之间生产上的联系和各种协作形态更广泛地在发展，集体所有的社会化水平显著地在提高，这就使合作社经济更加接近了全民所有制。四、随着农业技术革命的发展，合作社的生产资料和国家的、全民的生产资料的结合更为广泛，国家出物资和技术，合作社出劳动力，这样，农业劳动逐渐转化为工业劳动。五、朝鲜工、农之间生活水平的差异并不太大，因此，在合作社产品的处理上，除留够社员的口粮和充作副食品的部分外，下余全由国家收购处理，这样进一步接近于可以实行全国统一的工资制。
    他们认为，合作社转变为国营农场的基本途径，只要根据以下原则出发，不但不阻碍生产力的发展，反而能促进其发展。一、加速发挥经济上的优越性，充分利用其优越性；向国营农场转变中，必须是逐步地、分期地进行。二、不能影响生产力的发展，使国家财政减少到必要的最低限度。三、不减少农民原有的收入。
    在9月5日的第二次讨论会上，发言者就两种所有制过渡的途径问题开展了热烈的争辩。洪达善仍然坚持他的主张。他认为，目前在朝鲜农村中虽然已经形成像雄基郡和龙渊郡这样将合作社合并于国营农场的全郡性的综合经济单位，但是这两个郡在合并为国营综合农场时，国营经济的成份已占有压倒的优势。从全国来看，像雄基郡和龙渊郡这样国营经济占压倒优势的郡数，概略地计算有二十个左右，即只占全国总郡数的15％。因此，不能普遍地采用这两个郡的办法来实行过渡。他认为应该基本上保留农业合作社所有制，依靠合作经济的生命力，充分利用内部的一切潜力，加上国家投资的帮助，来提高合作社所有制的水平。他认为不应该单纯地依靠国家的追加投资，使农业合作社所有全部转化为国家所有，因为这样做不能不影响到工业发展、特别是重工业的优先发展，从而迟缓国民经济各部门生产的增长速度。
    在这次会上，大多数学者谈到级差地租的问题。他们认为，农村经济中存在着级差地租固然会影响到所有制的转化，但是不能因此就认为“转化”的途径不合理。级差地租和按劳分配的原则没有直接的关系，它在社会主义阶段不是必需的。目前，国家已经在调节级差地租方面采取了各种措施，消除级差地租的副作用。例如，农业税幅度的加大，灌溉使用费和代耕费的等级差别的规定，农产品的分地区收购，特别是水利化的完成和农业机械化的大力发展，会逐渐消除造成级差地租的物质基础。
    关于雄基郡和龙渊郡成立的综合农场的社会经济性质，根据调查的材料，有人认为它是综合性的大规模的企业组织。它和一般专业化生产的国营企业不同，包括了工、农、牧、渔等多种经营，并和全郡的文教、卫生和保健等部门紧密地结合了起来。但是，生产资料和一切产品全为国家所有，普遍实行按劳分配的统一工资制，这就消灭了工农间的差别。综合农场的设置，是由农业社所有制向全民所有制过渡的一个大胆尝试，为从社会主义向共产主义过渡积累经验。
