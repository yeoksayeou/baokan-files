A Large Number of Cadres Go Deep into Production Teams to Lead From the Top to Bottom
Wuxiang County Leadership Style Becomes More Thorough

    More than 70% of the cadres in Wuxiang County use 70% of their time to go deep into the production teams, participate in production, and lead production. They eat, live, work, and consult with commune members. Within a few months, in their work, there has emerged a new atmosphere of "three mores, three lesses, and three quicks": more people going deep into production and the fields, more specific research and problem-solving, and more ideas and suggestions; fewer people calling for forms and reports, fewer people loafing around, and fewer people making general calls and pointing fingers; faster implementation of the Party's policies, faster discovery and resolution of problems, and faster summary and promotion of advanced experiences.

    Taiyuan Dispatch from this newspaper, June 19th. More than 70% of the cadres in the party and government leadership departments and mass organizations in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, use 70% of their time to go deep into the production teams, participate in production, and lead production. They eat, live, and work with the commune members. In just a few months, a new atmosphere of "three mores, three lesses, and three quicks" has emerged among the vast number of cadres, promoting production to surge forward wave after wave.

    After carefully summarizing the experience of leading agricultural production over the years, the Wuxiang County Party Committee believes that improving the leadership style and strengthening the front line is an important key to the high-speed development of agricultural production. However, after a comprehensive top-down inspection of leadership styles, it was found that from the county party committee to the commune party committee, there was insufficient understanding of the importance of strengthening the production front line – the production team. Therefore, there was a lack of specific leadership over the production teams. The work teams sent down by the county party committee and the commune cadres only went to the management areas and rarely went deep into the production teams for specific leadership, preventing the work from being carried out thoroughly. This resulted in a top-heavy situation, leading to the unsatisfactory completion of production tasks. Last year, of the 1,160 production teams in the county, only 41% were surplus teams, while 25% were reduced production teams.

    The county party committee learned from past experiences and lessons and issued a call to all cadres in the county to "go deep into the production teams and strengthen the front line." In late April, the party committee held an on-site meeting with more than 300 people, including the secretaries of the commune party committees, the secretaries of the management area branches, and the captains of the production teams, in the Dayou Commune. It further summarized and exchanged the experience of the Fengtaiping Management Area Party Branch of this commune, which implemented a division of labor for standing committee members to be permanently assigned to teams, going deep into the production teams to participate in production and lead production, and cultivating red flag production teams. It criticized the tendency of some cadres to neglect the leadership of production teams. Among the 1,987 county, commune, and management area cadres in the county, the "three-seven system" of leadership methods was universally promoted, that is, three days out of ten were for the county party committee, commune party committee, and management area branch to hold meetings, study work, and learn, and the remaining seven days were spent going deep into the production teams to lead production. It was also stipulated that cadres going to the countryside to take charge of teams should act as small team advisors, train grassroots cadres; focus on setting examples and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences; work with commune members; implement the Party's policies well, and report work to the higher party committee.

    In order to complete these tasks, each cadre must ensure four things: ensure carrying five treasures (hoe, mattock, sickle, work point book, diary); ensure achieving "three comprehensions" (comprehending politics, comprehending production, comprehending management), "fourizations" (making work thorough and down-to-earth, regularizing labor, democratizing work style, and systematizing learning), and "five samenesses" (eating, living, working, consulting, and entertaining with the masses); ensure being a good "seven-member team" (production commander, combatant, feeder, cook, technician, propagandist, and learning instructor); and ensure that the team under their charge meets the standards of a red flag production team. At the same time, from the county to the commune to the management area, different leadership priorities were determined for advanced and backward teams, and a method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle was implemented to ensure the balanced development of each production team. The county party committee identified ten advanced teams and ten third-class teams as key points directly grasped by the county party committee. Thirty-five capable cadres from the county party committee departments and county-level agencies were transferred to form four work teams, led by the ministers, and permanently assigned to teams to create experience and promote it comprehensively. Communes and management areas also separately identified key points and fixed 1,337 cadres to take charge of teams. In addition, a total of 242 people, including the county party committee secretary, county party committee members, ministers, and leaders of various departments, each took charge of one advanced team or one backward team. In this way, a total of 1,987 cadres at the county, commune, and management area levels were assigned to lead 1,169 production teams.

    At the same time, the county party committee conducted a general rectification of the production team party branch leaders and team affairs committees based on the conditions of ideological redness, high enthusiasm, good leadership, mass support, good labor, and high technology. One hundred and twenty-three commune cadres and management area branch committee members were transferred to serve as captains and party branch leaders.

    In order to overcome the past tendency of work teams going to the countryside where "people are working, work is being done, and people leave, work stops," after cadres at all levels went deep into the production teams, they universally strengthened the training of grassroots cadres. They took time out in the evenings to help captains formulate short-term work plans, labor quotas, and organize competitions, giving team cadres ideas and suggestions, and achieving the same planning, same labor, and same execution. On the monthly "Love the Commune Day," all the cadres in charge of teams and the commune members spent "Love the Commune Day" together, using criticism and self-criticism to summarize the previous period, arrange the next period, democratically evaluate, and establish "five-good" pacesetters.

    The results of leaders at all levels going deep into the production front line, improving leadership style and leadership methods, not only enabled the vast number of cadres to universally achieve a triple harvest of ideology, business, and production, making work more solid and promoting the development of production, but also created a new atmosphere of "three mores, three lesses, three quicks, and one bottom-line check," that is, more people going deep into the fields of production teams for specific work, fewer people calling for forms and reports; more specific research and problem-solving with production teams, fewer people loafing around; more ideas and suggestions, fewer general calls and pointing fingers; ensuring faster implementation of the Party's policies; faster discovery and resolution of problems; faster summary and promotion of advanced experiences; and a bottom-line check from top to bottom.

    Because cadres at all levels went deep into the teams and mixed with the masses, the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. Wang Baoshu, the secretary of the Gugcheng Commune Party Committee, deeply felt the suffering of people carrying water and pulling mills while serving as a feeder. He and the feeders studied and reformed more than 100 tools, realizing the local mechanization of the feeding process, increasing the number of pigs fed by each person from the original 50 to 130.

    Many cadres have improved their leadership skills, enriched their knowledge, increased their talents, learned technology, and understood management through labor practice, and have generally realized that "going deep into the production team is the road for cadres to be both red and expert." According to a recent survey, of the 202 third-class production teams in the county, 112 have risen to second-class teams, and 42 have caught up with first-class teams.

    Under the leadership of the vast number of cadres, the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members is increasing day by day. The county's labor attendance rate has increased from 93% in the past to 98%; a total of more than 145,000 various tools have been reformed, and work efficiency has increased by one to three times; more than 300,000 mu of autumn fields were sown one season earlier than last year, with 190 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, more than double that of last year; the widespread implementation of improved seed close planting, high-yield crops were planted on 15,000 mu more than last year, and the cultivated area was expanded by more than 50,000 mu; the irrigated land was expanded to 70,000 mu, laying a good foundation for the high-speed development of agricultural production.

    大批干部深入生产队领导一竿子插到底
    武乡县领导作风更加深入
    武乡县70％以上的干部，用70％的时间，深入到生产队，参加生产领导生产，他们跟社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。几个月内，在工作中出现了深入生产和田间的人多，具体研究和解决问题多，想办法出主意多；打电话要表报的人少，蹓蹓跶跶的人少，一般号召和指手划脚的人少；党的方针政策贯彻快，发现和解决问题快，总结推广先进经验快的“三多、三少、三快”的新气象。
    本报太原19日电　山西省武乡县各级党政领导部门和群众团体70％以上的干部，用70％的时间，深入到生产队，参加生产领导生产，他们和社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动，在短短的几个月内，在广大干部中出现了“三多、三少、三快”的新气象，促使生产一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    中共武乡县委认真总结了历年领导农业生产的经验以后，认为改进领导作风，加强第一线，是高速度发展农业生产的重要关键。但经过全面从上而下检查领导作风，发现从县委到公社党委，由于对加强生产第一线——生产队的重要意义认识不足，因而存在着对生产队的领导不具体，县委派下去的工作组和公社干部，只到管理区，很少深入生产队具体领导，使工作不能一竿子插到底。这样，头重脚轻，致使生产任务不能圆满完成。去年全县一千一百六十个生产队，超产队仅占总数的41％，而减产队却占25％。
    县委接受以往经验教训，向全县干部提出了“深入生产队，加强第一线”的号召。并于4月下旬，在大有公社召开了各公社党委书记、管理区支书、生产队队长等三百余人的现场会议、进一步总结交流了这个公社凤台坪管理区党支部委员实行分工常年固定包队，深入生产队参加生产领导生产，培养红旗生产队的经验，批判了一些干部忽视生产队领导的倾向。在全县一千九百八十七名县、公社、管理区三级干部中，普遍推行了“三七制”的领导方法，即十天当中，有三天为县委、公社党委、管理区支部开会、研究工作和学习的时间，其余七天深入生产队领导生产。并规定各级下乡包队干部都要当好小队参谋，培养基层干部；搞重点树榜样，总结推广先进经验；和社员一起劳动；贯彻执行好党的方针政策，向上级党委汇报工作情况。
    为了完成这些任务，每个干部要做到四保证：保证身带五件宝（锄头、钁头、镰刀、记工本、日记本）；保证做到“三通”（通政治、通生产、通管理），“四化”（工作深入踏实化、劳动经常化、作风民主化、学习制度化），“五同”（与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同娱乐）；保证当好“七员”（生产指挥员、战斗员、饲养员、炊事员、技术员、宣传员、学习辅导员）；保证所包队达到红旗生产队标准。同时从县到公社、到管理区都确定先进和落后不同的领导重点，实行抓两头带中间的办法，保证各生产队的平衡发展。县委确定了十个先进队，十个三类队为县委直接抓的重点。抽调了县委部长、县级各机关得力干部三十五人，组成四个工作组，由部长挂帅，常年固定包干到队，创造经验，全面推动。各公社、管理区也分别确定了重点，固定了一千三百三十七名包队干部。此外，县委书记、县委委员、部长、各部门领导干部共二百四十二人，每人分别包干联系一个先进队或一个落后队。这样，全县三级包队干部共达一千九百八十七名，包干领导一千一百六十九个生产队。
    同时县委根据思想红、干劲高、领导好、群众拥护、劳动好、技术高等条件，普遍对生产队党小组长和队务委员会进行了一次整顿，抽调了公社干部、管理区支委一百二十三人，下放当队长和党小组长。
    为了克服过去工作组下乡“人在工作在、人走工作走”的偏向，各级干部深入生产队以后，普遍加强了对基层干部的培养。他们抽晚上时间，帮助队长制订小段作业计划、劳动定额和组织竞赛，给队干部出主意想办法，做到了同计划、同劳动、同执行。在每月一次的“爱社日”里，所有包队干部和社员一起过“爱社日”，用批评与自我批评的方法，总结上段、安排下段，民主评比，树立“五好”标兵。
    各县各级领导干部，深入生产第一线，改进领导作风和领导方法的结果，不仅使广大干部普遍获得了思想、业务、生产三丰收，使工作做的更加扎实，促进了生产的发展，而且出现了“三多、三少、三快、一摸底”的新气象，即深入生产队田间具体工作的人多，打电话要表报人少；和生产队具体研究解决问题多，蹓蹓跶跶的人少；想办法出主意多，一般号召指手划脚少；保证了党的方针政策贯彻快；发现与解决问题快；总结推广先进经验快；上下都摸底。
    由于各级干部深入到队，和群众打成一片，更加密切了干群关系。故城公社党委书记王保书，在当饲养员中深深体会到人担水、拉磨的苦恼，他和饲养员一起研究、改革工具一百多件，实现了饲养过程土机械化，每人由原来喂猪五十头提高到一百三十头。
    许多干部通过劳动实践，提高了领导能力，丰富了知识，增长了才干，学会了技术，懂得了管理，普遍认识到“深入生产队是干部又红又专的道路”。据最近调查排队，全县二百零二个三类生产队中，已有一百一十二个上升为二类队，四十二个赶上了一类队。
    在广大干部的带领下，广大社员的劳动热情日趋高涨。全县劳动出勤率由过去93％达到98％；共改革各种工具十四万五千余件，工效提高一至三倍以上；三十多万亩秋田比去年提前一个节令下种，每亩施底肥一百九十担，比去年增加一倍多；普遍实行了优种密植，高产作物比去年多种一万五千亩，扩大耕田面积五万多亩；水地扩大到七万亩，为高速度发展农业生产打下了良好基础。
