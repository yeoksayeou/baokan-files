    We must Fight the American Robbers to the End
    He Xiangning
    "Those who come are not friendly, and the friendly do not come." The sinister purpose of the American aggressor chieftain Eisenhower's robber trip to Taiwan has been fully exposed. This god of war openly clamored that the United States would continue to occupy Taiwan by force and be enemies with the Chinese people to the end. As pointed out in the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" by the Fujian Front Command of the People's Liberation Army: Eisenhower's policy is Dulles' policy, specifically, to realize the conspiracy of the United States to create "two Chinas" and completely turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony. This is absolutely intolerable to every patriotic Chinese.
    U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for a full ten years. In the past ten years, the rich and beautiful island of Taiwan has become a living hell, and our Taiwan compatriots have suffered all kinds of bullying, exploitation, oppression, and humiliation from the American invaders. Even the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan deeply feel the pain of being under someone else's roof and having to look to them for everything. Seeing the fate of Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Kishi Nobusuke, how can they not feel disheartened? Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan has aggravated the suffering of my Taiwan compatriots. However, the Taiwan compatriots, who have a tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism, will never submit to the oppression of the American invaders; the greater the enemy's pressure, the more eager they will be to drive out the American imperialists and return to the embrace of the motherland. I earnestly hope that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan will put the national interest first and be able to unite with the vast number of patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu to deal with the common enemy, American imperialism. Everyone knows that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was surrounded by the armed forces of imperialism in Bai'etanz, but he resolutely refused to submit to imperialism. Patriotic anti-imperialism is the fundamental spirit of the Three People's Principles; those who are loyal lackeys of the United States are not worthy of being called Sun Yat-sen's followers, and they will never have a good end. Wang Jingwei is an example. All patriotic Chinese should unite and resolutely fight against the American aggressors.
    Ten years ago, the great Chinese people held high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and together with the Korean people, defeated the U.S. armed aggression; today, they have even more confidence and strength to liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan. We absolutely cannot allow the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" to succeed, and we must drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan and thoroughly settle every crime committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people.
    U.S. imperialism continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, its invading army赖 (lai) stays in South Korea and refuses to leave, and it forces the Japanese people to accept the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This fully shows that although U.S. imperialism has been severely打击 (daji) hit by the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Japanese people, and has been unanimously opposed and谴责 (qianze) condemned by the people of Asian countries, its ambition to launch new wars of aggression and further enslave the Asian people has not died. The people of all countries under the rule and oppression of U.S. imperialism, like the Japanese people, must wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors and their agents with perseverance and renewed efforts, so that they will surely be able to move from victory to new victory. The aggressive and warlike nature of U.S. imperialism will never change until its death. If the people of all countries want to live in peace, they must unite closely, form the broadest united front against imperialism, and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.
    The great Chinese people regard opposing aggression, defending peace, and supporting the national democratic movements of all countries as their sacred and lofty duty, and will always stand at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, our comrades in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must throw themselves into the raging fire of the current anti-U.S. struggle, strengthen our training, fight resolutely, and actively contribute all our strength to smash the U.S. policy of aggression and war, liberate Taiwan, and defend peace!

    要同美国强盗斗争到底
    何香凝
    “来者不善，善者不来”。美国侵略头子艾森豪威尔到台湾作强盗旅行的罪恶目的已经暴露无遗了。这个战争瘟神公然叫嚣美国将继续武力霸占台湾，与中国人民为敌到底。正如人民解放军福建前线司令部“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”所指出的：艾森豪威尔的政策就是杜勒斯的政策，具体地说，就是要实现美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，把台湾完全沦为美国的殖民地。这是每一个有爱国心的中国人所绝对不能容忍的。
    美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾整整十年了。十年来，富饶美丽的宝岛台湾变成了人间地狱，我台湾同胞受尽了美国侵略者的欺凌、剥削、压迫和凌辱。就是在台湾的国民党军政人员，也深感寄人篱下随人俯仰的痛苦，看到李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介的下场，更能不寒心？ 艾森豪威尔的台湾之行，更加重了我台湾同胞的灾难。但是有着反帝爱国传统的台湾同胞，绝对不会屈服于美国侵略者的压迫；敌人的压力愈大，他们赶走美帝，回到祖国怀抱之心也必然愈切。我恳切希望在台湾的国民党军政人员以民族大义为重，能够与台、澎、金、马广大爱国军民同胞敌忾同仇，来对付共同敌人美帝国主义。大家知道，孙中山先生在白鹅潭身受帝国主义的武力包围，也坚决不肯向帝国主义屈服。爱国反帝是三民主义的根本精神；当美国的忠实走狗，就不配称中山信徒，也决不会有好下场。汪精卫就是一个例子。一切有爱国心的中国人，都应当团结起来，同美国侵略者坚决斗争。
    伟大的中国人民十年前高举抗美援朝的旗帜，同朝鲜人民一道，打败了美国的武装侵略；今天更有信心有力量解放自己的神圣领土台湾。我们绝对不能容许美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞，一定要把美国侵略者赶出台湾，彻底清算美帝国主义对中国人民所犯下的每一罪行。
    美帝国主义继续霸占中国领土台湾，他的侵略军赖在南朝鲜不走，强迫日本人民接受日美军事同盟条约。这都充分说明美帝国主义虽然受到中国人民，朝鲜人民，日本人民的沉重打击，遭到亚洲各国人民的一致反对和谴责，但是它发动新的侵略战争和进一步奴役亚洲人民的野心还没有死。处在美帝国主义统治压迫下的各国人民，要同日本人民一样，不屈不挠再接再厉地向美国侵略者和它的代理人进行坚决的斗争，这样就一定能够从胜利走向新的胜利。美帝国主义侵略好战的本性是至死也不会改变的。各国人民要过太平日子，就必须紧密地团结起来，结成最广泛的反帝统一战线，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    伟大的中国人民把反对侵略，保卫和平，支持各国人民的民族民主运动，看作是自己神圣的崇高职责，永远站在反美斗争的最前列。我们民革同志要在伟大的中国共产党领导下，投入当前反美斗争的熊熊烈火，加强锻炼，坚决斗争，为粉碎美国侵略战争政策，解放台湾，保卫和平，积极贡献自己的一切力量！
