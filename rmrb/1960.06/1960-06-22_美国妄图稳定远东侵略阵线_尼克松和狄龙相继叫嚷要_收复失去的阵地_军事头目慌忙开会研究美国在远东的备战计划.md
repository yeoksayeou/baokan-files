Xinhua News Agency, June 20th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon and Under Secretary of State Dillon both issued statements on the postponement of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, acknowledging that U.S. policy had suffered a setback. At the same time, they clamored that the United States would never change its policy toward Japan and would find ways to "recapture lost ground."

Nixon, in a speech to the Texas Press Association on the 18th, admitted that the postponement of the U.S. President's visit to Japan was a "regrettable event." However, he tried to conceal the failure of the United States, distorting the righteous act of the broad masses of Japanese people against Eisenhower's visit as merely the work of "a few militants" and a "Communist attempt to gain propaganda advantages." Nixon clamored that if allowing Japan to cancel Eisenhower's visit "forced" the United States to change its policy toward Japan, it would be a "grave mistake."

Dillon, in a national television address on the 19th, admitted that the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan "was disappointing." He said that the "situation" in Japan "should not be taken lightly." He tried his best to calm the U.S. ruling group, saying that they should not "panic" as a result. He said that this was merely an episode "in the life-and-death struggle with Communism," and "we cannot win every battle."

Dillon emphasized that the United States should immediately proceed with the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military treaty. He also clamored that the United States should "stand firm," "recapture lost ground," and "tighten our belts and move forward, trying to make sure that we come out ahead in the end."

In his speech, Dillon also emphasized the need to "aid" America's Asian "allies" with more arms and dollars to stabilize America's increasingly shaky aggressive front in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The struggle of the people of Far Eastern countries against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has shaken the U.S. aggressive front in the region. U.S. military leaders have hastily held meetings for days to secretly plot countermeasures and have issued a flurry of war cries and intimidation.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates, after convening a three-day secret meeting of senior U.S. military officers stationed around the world, threatened at a press conference on the 18th that the United States "now has strong forces stationed in the Western Pacific region and will rapidly increase these forces when necessary." Gates also boasted that the United States now has "a good military plan" and "there is no problem with combat readiness."

Gates said that the United States is currently "living in a period that emphasizes the Cold War more" and must be "very careful and very vigilant." He insisted that the United States establish military bases on the territory of other countries, calling this the so-called "forward strategy." He said: "As a principle, we must maintain a forward strategy." However, Gates was worried about the future of U.S. bases in Japan. He said, "If the (U.S.-Japan military) treaty arrangement fails, losing the bases in Japan will force us to go somewhere else." It is reported that the U.S. Far East military strategy was re-examined at this U.S. military conference.

U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Felt convened a meeting of his subordinate naval, land, and air force commanders at the U.S. Pacific Headquarters in Pearl Harbor on the 16th. According to United Press International reporter Potts, this meeting was held in an atmosphere of "pessimistic speculation" and "fear" among the U.S. military "after Japanese leftists won the first round in their struggle to drive U.S. troops out of Japan." He wrote that U.S. "officers are worried that the increasingly sharp Japanese crisis that forced the cancellation of President Eisenhower's visit will not stop there. They believe that there is a possibility that the entire U.S.-Japan alliance will break down, forcing the United States to withdraw its extremely important naval, air, and supply bases in Japan." Potts revealed that U.S. military leaders in the Pacific region discussed measures on how to deal with the current situation.

    军事头目慌忙开会研究美国在远东的备战计划
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松和副国务卿狄龙分别就艾森豪威尔被迫延期访日发表谈话，承认美国政策遭到挫败。同时，他们叫嚷美国绝不改变对日政策，而且要设法“收复失去的阵地”。
    尼克松18日在美国得克萨斯州新闻协会发表演说承认，美国总统延期访日是“令人遗憾的事件”。但是他力图掩饰美国的失败，把日本广大人民反对艾森豪威尔访问的义举歪曲为只是“少数好斗的人”的事，是“共产党企图取得宣传上的好处”。尼克松叫嚷，如果让日本取消艾森豪威尔访问一事“迫使”美国改变对日政策，那将是“莫大的错误”。
    狄龙19日在一次全国性的电视演说中承认艾森豪威尔对日本的访问不得不撤销“使人们感到很失望”。他说，对日本的“局势不得予以轻视”。他竭力强自镇定地要美国统治集团人士不应该因此“感到惊慌”。他说，这仅仅是“跟共产主义进行生死斗争中”的一个插曲，“我们不可能在每一场战斗中都获胜”。
    狄龙强调美国应该立即着手批准日美军事条约。他还叫嚣美国要
  “立场坚定”，要“收复失去的阵地”，“要束紧裤带前进。设法使我们到头来获得好处”。
    狄龙在演说中还强调要以更多的军火和美元“援助”美国的亚洲“盟友”，以稳定美国在亚洲的日益动摇的侵略阵线。
    新华社19日讯　远东国家人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争震撼了美国在这个地区的侵略阵线，美国军事首脑连日来慌忙举行会议密谋对策，并且大发战争和恫吓的叫嚣。
    美国国防部长盖茨在召集美国派驻世界各地的高级军官举行了三天秘密会议之后18日在记者招待会上恫吓说，美国“现在在西太平洋地区驻有强大的部队，并将在有需要的时候迅速增加这些部队”。盖茨还吹嘘说，美国现在有着“一个良好的军事计划”，“作战准备毫无问题。”
    盖茨说什么美国目前“生活在一个更多地强调冷战”的时期中，必须“非常注意、非常警惕”。他坚持美国在别国领土上建立军事基地，把这叫做所谓“前沿战略”。他说：“作为一个原则来讲，我们必须保持一种前沿战略”。但是，盖茨担心美国在日本的基地的前途。他说，“如果（日美军事）条约安排失败，丧失在日本的基地将把我们赶到其他某个地方去”。据报道，在美国这个军事会议上重新研究了美国的远东军事战略。
    美国驻太平洋部队司令哈里·费耳特海军上将16日在珍珠港美军太平洋总部召集了他属下的海陆空军司令举行了会议。据合众国际社记者波茨报道，这个会议是“在日本左翼分子在争取把美国部队赶出日本的斗争的第一回合取得胜利后”在美国军方“悲观的猜测”和“恐惧”的气氛下举行的。他写道，美国“军官们担心，迫使取消艾森豪威尔总统访问的日益尖锐的日本危机不会到此为止。他们认为会有这样的可能性：整个美日同盟会破裂，以至迫使美国撤出它在日本的极为重要的海军、空军基地以及供应基地”。波茨透露，美国驻太平洋地区的军事头目讨论了如何对付目前的局势的措施。
