Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 2nd: The majority of the more than 80,000 becak drivers in Jakarta went on strike yesterday to protest the enactment of Jakarta's new becak regulations. Government employees, workers, and students without their own vehicles had to walk to their offices and schools yesterday.

The new regulations, issued by the Jakarta wartime authorities, require becak drivers to have driver's licenses, fare receipts, and to add different colors to their becaks in order to operate in designated areas with distinction. A spokesman for the Jakarta wartime authorities, Edi, said, "We will not hesitate to take drastic measures against becak drivers who violate these regulations."
