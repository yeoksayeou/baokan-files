Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: The Taiwanese people are angrily protesting against American imperialism's cultural aggression. Recently, some newspapers in Taiwan have published numerous reports about the "hopeless state of education," the "film and theater industry on the verge of collapse," the "shocking and disheartening decline of morals," as well as news of murder, robbery, drug trafficking, and juvenile delinquency. They also published articles by people from all walks of life calling for "the banning of slave education and yellow culture."

American imperialism's cultural aggression has become increasingly rampant as it intensifies its military control and economic plunder of Taiwan. American newspapers openly admit that to create "two Chinas," Taiwan must be "Americanized" so that the Taiwanese people will be "loyal to its ally (the United States)." The American "Stars and Stripes" stated in an article entitled "Formosa: A Chinese Island with an American Flavor" that Americans should not only ensure that Taiwan's military officers, civil servants, teachers, engineers, and students all speak English and follow "American culture," but also that Chinese people at all levels accept "American influence." American imperialism has dispatched a large number of personnel to Taiwan to set up numerous cultural aggression institutions. In addition to the notorious "United States Information Service," "Asia Foundation," the propaganda agencies affiliated with the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, and the U.S. International Cooperation Administration Taiwan Branch, even the "American Newspaper Institute" and the "American 4-H Club" have branches in Taiwan. They use books, leaflets, speeches, and even propaganda vehicles to poison the Taiwanese people. The United States has infiltrated all universities in Taiwan under the guise of "cooperation," dispatching cultural spies.

American imperialism has also used a large number of so-called "missionaries" wearing religious cloaks to openly carry out cultural aggression and espionage activities in Taiwan. "New York Times" reporter Tillman Durdin recently reported from Taiwan that there are approximately 7,200 foreign missionaries in Taiwan, an average of more than 300 in each county and city. The vast majority of these missionaries are American, and most of the American "missionaries" are affiliated with intelligence organizations such as the CIA and the intelligence department of the U.S. Pacific Command.

Under the increasingly rampant cultural aggression of American imperialism, Taiwan's culture and education have been greatly devastated. The Taipei "United Daily News" and other newspapers recently published articles stating that Taiwan has now become a "cultural desert." As the education sector deteriorates and educators face dire circumstances, the Taipei "Gonglun Bao" reported that Liang Yongding, a 35-year-old teacher who had been teaching for seven years at Zhuwei Elementary School in Dayuan Township, Taoyuan County, committed suicide by cutting his stomach because he could not bear the pressure of life, leaving behind his wife and six children. Under the impact of American movies, A-go-go dances, and swing dances, Taiwan's film and theater industry is teetering on the brink of collapse. Some of Taiwan's film production companies went bankrupt last year, and others did not produce a single film. Even Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Motion Picture Corporation" is losing money and struggling to survive. It began "restructuring" in January of this year, laying off more than 80 employees. After a deputy director was laid off due to illness, his wife recently committed suicide by poisoning, abandoning her three children because of the hardship of life. Some actresses, with no other options, either sing, become dancers, or become prostitutes. While cultural undertakings are in a state of widespread depression, dance halls, bars, and brothels are rising in their place. The "beauty pageants" and "dog shows" held by the United States in Taiwan are also extremely popular.

Under the poison of American "civilization" and the American "way of life," there are many hooligan and loafer organizations such as "Thirteen Taibaos," "Eighteen Vajra," "Flying Tiger Party," and "Three K Gang" in Taiwan's cities and towns. They wear American jeans and other strange clothes, provoke fights, rob with weapons, commit murder, steal, and rape women, doing all kinds of evil. The Taiwan Provincial Police Department of the Chiang Kai-shek clique admits that there were more than 46,650 criminal cases in Taiwan last year, an average of more than 120 cases per day, of which juvenile delinquency accounted for a large proportion. For example, an eleven-year-old child, imitating a big thief in an American film, robbed a woman buying vegetables of her purse in broad daylight at the market.

    美国报纸赤裸宣布要使台湾美国化
    台湾人民愤怒抗议文化侵略
    据新华社16日讯　台湾人民愤怒抗议美帝国主义文化侵略。最近台湾一些报纸，大登其“教育事业一筹莫展”、“影剧业濒于绝境”、“乱世颓风触目惊心”和凶杀、抢劫、贩毒以及少年犯罪等消息，并发表各界人士的文章，要求“取缔奴化教育和黄色文明”。
    美帝国主义对台湾的文化侵略，是随着它加紧对台湾的军事控制、经济掠夺而日益猖獗。美国报纸赤裸裸地承认，要制造“两个中国”，必须把台湾“美国化”，使台湾人民“忠实于他的盟国（美国）”。美国“明星报”在一篇题为“福摩萨：具有美国味道的中国”的文章中说，美国人不仅要使台湾的军官、文官、教师、工程师和学生等都会讲英语，追随“美国文化”，而且要使各阶层的中国人都能接受“美国影响”。美帝国主义派遣大批人员在台湾设下了许多文化侵略机构，除了臭名远扬的“美国新闻处”、“亚洲基金会”、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团和美国国际合作署台湾分署所属的宣传机构等以外，连“美国新闻学会”、“美国四—H俱乐部”等也在台湾有分支机构。他们用书刊、传单、演讲，以至宣传车等多种多样形式来毒害台湾人民。台湾现有的大学，美国都以“合作”为名，派遣文化特务渗入。
    美帝国主义还使用了大批披着宗教外衣的所谓“传教士”，公开在台湾进行文化侵略和特务活动。美国“纽约时报”记者窦奠安最近从台湾发出的消息说，现在台湾外籍传教士约有七千二百人，平均每个县、市有三百多人。这些传教士当中绝大多数是美国人，而美国“传教士”当中大多数又隶属美国中央情报局、太平洋美军总部情报处等特务组织。
    在美帝国主义日益猖獗的文化侵略下，台湾文化教育大受摧残。台北“联合报”等最近发表文章说，台湾现在变成了“文化沙漠”。由于教育事业每况愈下，教育人员处境悲惨，台北“公论报”报道说，一个任教七年，年仅三十五岁的教员梁永丁，在桃园县大园乡竹围小学，因忍受不了生活压迫，抛下妻女六人切腹自杀。在美国电影、阿飞舞、摇摆舞的冲击下，台湾影剧业摇摇欲坠。台湾的几家电影制片公司，去年有的倒闭了，有的连一部影片都没拍出来。连蒋介石的“中央电影制片公司”也亏蚀不支，从今年1月开始“整顿”，裁员八十余人，一个副厂长因病被裁以后，他的妻子最近因生活困苦丢下三个孩子而服毒自杀。一些女演员在走头无路的情况下，有的卖唱、当舞女，有的沦为娼妓。在文化事业百业萧条中，代之而起的是舞厅、酒吧、妓院。美国在台湾举办的“选举美女”、“狗展”等也极为风行。
    在美国“文明”和美国“生活方式”毒害下，台湾大小城镇都有许多“十三太保”、“十八金刚”、“飞虎党”、“三K帮”等流氓、阿飞组织，他们穿着美国牛仔裤等各种奇异服装，寻衅格斗，持械抢劫、行凶偷窃、奸污妇女，无恶不做。蒋介石集团台湾省警务处承认，去年台湾刑事案件四万六千六百五十多件，每天平均一百二十起以上，其中青少年犯罪案占很大比例。如有十一岁的儿童，效仿美国影片上的大盗，大白天到菜市抢夺买菜妇女的皮包。
