    ·Striving for High Yields Underground·
    Just as dawn was breaking, blasting team leader Li Guangxue arrived at the mining face. He said to everyone with great enthusiasm: "Comrades, today we must achieve 250 tons! Using deep-hole blasting, one blast will be equivalent to two. Do you all have the confidence to do it?" Everyone replied in unison: "We can definitely do it!"
    This was the beginning of the battle to seize high yields of iron ore by the Sixteenth Mining Team of the Qijiang Iron Mine in Sichuan Province. The daily output of 250 tons was a record created by the mine's performance team at the Qijiang City Advanced Representatives Conference during the Great Battle of Red May. From that moment on, they made a great and ambitious goal to catch up with and surpass the advanced. Achieving this number was not simple. Their production conditions were not as good as other teams: the ore seam was low, the roof was poor, and their current production level was far from this target, with a daily output of only a little over 100 tons. However, they were determined to increase their output several times over in the short term, to provide the steel furnaces with more ore.
    Soon, several pneumatic drills began to fiercely attack the hard rock face. Drillers Li Guangxue, Xiong Zhengbang, and Chen Zhonghua competed with each other, refusing to give way, and the competition became more and more enthusiastic. This time, master worker Li Guangxue personally operated the pneumatic drill and carried out major innovations. He modified the way the air was turned on and off and the way the drill was moved. He managed to move the drill without stopping the air supply to the drill leg. The team drilled twenty-one to twenty-three blastholes, and the depth of the blastholes was increased from about one meter to 1.7 to 1.8 meters, greatly improving the blasting efficiency. What was the secret to drilling the holes quickly and well? The miners all gathered around Li Guangxue to learn from him. After Master Li shared his experience, everyone immediately promoted it, and the number and depth of blastholes drilled per shift significantly increased, successively creating new high-yield records of 366 tons and 457 tons of ore per day.

    ·井下夺高产·
    天刚蒙蒙亮，打眼工班长李光学就来到了采矿工作面。他兴致勃勃地对大家说：“同志们，今天我们要拿下二百五十吨！用深眼爆破法，放一炮顶两炮，大家有信心吗？”大家齐声道：“拿得下这么多！”
    这是四川省綦江铁矿采矿第十六队夺矿砂高产战斗的开始。日产二百五十吨，那是在大战红五月里，綦江市先进代表会矿山表演队在他们矿创造的纪录，从此他们就立下了雄心大志，一定要赶先进，超先进。要完成这个数字并不简单。他们的生产条件比不上别的队：矮矮的矿层，顶板也差，现在的生产水平距离这个指标还很远，日产不过一百多吨。可是他们决心大，要在短期之内番上加番，给高炉生产更多的矿石。
    一会儿，几部风钻一齐向着坚硬的岩壁猛攻起来了。打眼手李光学、熊正帮、陈中华三人，你追我赶，互不相让，越赛越打得欢。李光学师傅这回亲手掌握风钻，大搞革新，开风闭气，移动风机等，都不是按原来的方法进行，做到了移动风机，风腿不停风，小班打了二十一到二十三个炮眼，炮眼的深度由一米左右增加到一米七至一米八，使爆破效率大大提高。打眼又快，又好，窍门在哪里呢？采矿工人们都围着李光学，向他请教。李师傅介绍了他的经验以后，大家马上推广，每班打炮眼的数量和深度有了显著的提高，接连创造了日产矿石三百六十六吨、四百五十七吨的高产新纪录。　　　　（谢秀宇）（附图片）
