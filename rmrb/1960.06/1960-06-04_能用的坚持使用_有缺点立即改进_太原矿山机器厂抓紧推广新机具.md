Using What Works, Immediately Improving What Has Defects
Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Seizes the Opportunity to Promote New Machinery

This newspaper, Taiyuan, 3rd report – In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, with the spirit of continuous revolution, promptly resolved ideological and practical problems, achieving innovation in batches, summarizing in batches, consolidating in batches, and improving in batches, leading to local flowering and local results, promoting the movement to develop forward more widely, more deeply, and more persistently.

Since December of last year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in this plant has seen one high tide after another, progressing rapidly and achieving great success. However, in early April, the phenomenon of technical innovation not being closely integrated with production, and insufficient use and promotion of new technologies and new equipment emerged. Of the 445 sets (pieces) of new equipment successfully trial-produced by the plant, only 244 sets (pieces) were frequently used, accounting for 54.8%; 142 sets (pieces) were used intermittently or rarely, accounting for 31.9%, and 59 sets (pieces) were not used at all. Upon discovering this problem, the plant's Party committee promptly analyzed and studied it, believing that the occurrence of this phenomenon was mainly due to the influence of right-leaning conservative thinking. Some cadres lacked the determination to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution to the end. They did not support or encourage new equipment when its efficiency did not significantly improve for a time; some were only satisfied with the number of innovations, neglecting to persist in using and improving in practice, only focusing on innovation but not on consolidation and promotion, forming a situation of doing it in the front but discarding it in the back, only flowering but not bearing fruit. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the workers to continue engaging in large-scale technical innovation was affected.

Based on the above situation, the plant's Party committee made a decision "Regarding Vigorously Consolidating, Promoting, and Improving New Technologies, New Equipment, and New Experiences," and launched a large-scale airing of views, debate, and discussion among all employees, taking the question of whether or not to consolidate, promote, and improve new technologies and new equipment as the theme. First, it criticized the "opposition theory" of innovation and production, and also criticized the erroneous attitude of a few people who demanded perfection in new things, and completely negated them if there were any shortcomings. It corrected the erroneous view of some people who believed that engaging in production could not engage in innovation, and engaging in innovation could not leap forward, enabling all employees to further recognize the relationship between innovation and production, and the relationship between creation and consolidation and improvement. Subsequently, under the leadership of the plant's Party committee, and directly under the responsibility of the chief engineer, the plant's summary and appraisal technical innovation guidance group was formed, absorbing leaders, technical personnel, and veteran workers from various workshops, sections, and offices. Various workshops also organized new technology appraisal teams, advanced experience promotion teams, and technical innovation promotion groups, and many workers put forward the slogan "Use what works immediately, and immediately improve what has problems." The whole plant quickly set off a hot and vigorous high tide of vigorously grasping the consolidation and promotion of new technologies and new experiences. Within two days of the Party committee's decision, the melting and casting workshop improved and appraised seven types of equipment, such as sandblasting machines and molding machines, and promptly put them into production. The new technology promotion group of the first metalworking workshop, in ten days, inspected 264 leftover problems in technical innovation in this workshop, and 257 items were satisfactorily resolved at that time.

In the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving new technologies, two approaches emerged. One was that a few leaders, technicians, or a small number of professionals glanced over it superficially and roughly, and then carried out summary and appraisal, and even determined "usable" or "unusable" based on their usual impressions, without consulting with the masses or going through careful observation and production practice. The other was to adopt the method of "three combinations" of cadres, technicians, and workers, collectively study, conduct on-the-spot experiments, improve, and appraise. The plant's Party committee promptly praised the latter approach of mobilizing the masses, conducting large-scale summaries, large-scale inspections, large-scale demonstrations, and large-scale appraisals, and criticized and corrected the "minority line" and the perfunctory approach, pushing the promotion and improvement of technical innovation achievements of the whole plant to a newer high tide.

Because the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant adhered to the spirit of continuous revolution in the work of consolidating, promoting, and improving new technologies, new equipment, and new experiences, and promptly resolved various ideological problems existing among employees, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in the whole plant was both vigorous and down-to-earth. The 142 sets (pieces) of equipment that were originally in a state of half-use and half-stop or rarely used were successively put into production, and the remaining few sets of equipment that were determined not to be used were also properly disposed of. Through summary, consolidation, appraisal, and promotion, not only were the original innovation achievements consolidated, but also the enthusiasm of the workers and masses to further engage in large-scale technical innovation was greatly encouraged. In April, the number of innovation proposals put forward by all employees of the plant greatly increased compared with March, and the production plan was overfulfilled ahead of schedule. The production situation in May was also very good. By May 26, the plant's annual total output value plan had been completed 50.02%.

    能用的坚持使用　有缺点立即改进
    太原矿山机器厂抓紧推广新机具
    本报太原3日电　太原矿山机器厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，以不断革命精神，及时解决思想问题和实际问题，做到了革新一批，总结一批，巩固一批，提高一批，就地开花，就地结果，促使运动更广泛、更深入、更持久的向前发展。
    从去年12月以来，这个厂的技术革新和技术革命运动一个高潮接着一个高潮，进展很快，成绩很大。但在4月初却出现了革新和生产结合得不紧，新技术、新设备使用推广不够的现象。全厂试制成功的四百四十五台（件）新设备，经常使用的只有二百四十四台（件）占54．8％；时用时停和很少使用的有一百四十二台（件）占31．9％，还有五十九台（件）根本不用。厂党委发现这个问题，及时进行了分析研究，认为这种现象的发生，主要是右倾保守思想作怪，部分干部缺乏把技术革新和技术革命进行到底的决心，新设备一时效率没有显著提高，就不支持，不鼓励；有的只满足于革新的数字，忽视坚持使用和在实践中改进提高，只抓革新，不抓巩固、推广，形成前面搞，后面丢，只开花，不结果。因此，影响了工人们继续大搞技术革新的积极性。
    根据以上情况，厂党委做出了“关于大力巩固、推广、提高新技术、新设备、新经验”的决定，以要不要巩固、推广、提高新技术、新设备为题，在全体职工中展开了大鸣大放大辩论，首先批判了革新与生产“对立论”，同时也批判了少数人要求新东西完美无缺，一有缺点就全盘否定的错误态度，纠正了一些人认为抓生产不能搞革新，抓革新就不能跃进的错误观点，使全体职工进一步认清了革新同生产的关系，创造同巩固提高的关系。接着，在厂党委领导下，由总工程师直接负责，吸收各车间、科、室领导、技术人员和老工人等组成了厂的总结鉴定技术革新指导小组，各车间也纷纷组织新技术鉴定队、先进经验推广队、技术革新促进团等组织，许多工人提出了“能用的马上用，有问题的立即改”的口号，全厂很快热火朝天掀起了大抓巩固、推广新技术、新经验的高潮。熔铸车间在党委决定发出两天内，就把抛砂机、压模造型机等七种设备进行了改进和鉴定，及时投入了生产。一金工车间的推广新技术促进团，十天时间在本车间检查出了二百六十四个技术革新中的遗留问题，当时就有二百五十七项得到了圆满解决。
    在巩固、推广、提高新技术的过程中，又出现了两种做法。一种是几个领导、技术员或少数专业人员跑马观花、粗略地过一遍，就进行总结鉴定，甚至根据平时的印象就确定“能用”或“不能用”，既不和群众商量，也不通过仔细观察和生产实践。另一种是采取干部、技术人员、工人“三结合”的办法，集体研究，当场实验、改进、鉴定。厂党委及时表扬了发动群众，大总结、大检查、大表演、大鉴定的后一种做法，批判和纠正了“少数人路线”和了草从事的做法，把全厂的推广、提高技术革新成果推向了更新的高潮。
    太原矿山机器厂由于在巩固、推广、提高新技术、新设备、新经验的工作中，坚持了不断革命的精神，及时解决了职工中存在的各种各样的思想问题，致使全厂的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。原来陷于半用半停和很少使用的一百四十二台（件）设备，陆续投入了生产，剩下的几台确定不用的设备，也做了适当处理。经过总结、巩固、鉴定和推广，不仅巩固了原来的革新成果，而且大大鼓舞了职工群众进一步大闹技术革新的积极性。4月份全厂职工提出的革新建议比3月份大大增加，生产计划提前超额完成。5月份的生产情况也很好，到5月26日，全厂年度总产值计划已完成50．02％。
