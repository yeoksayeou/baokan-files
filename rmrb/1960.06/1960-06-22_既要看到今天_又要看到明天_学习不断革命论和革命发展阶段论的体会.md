    —Reflections on Studying the Theory of Uninterrupted Revolution and the Theory of Stages of Revolutionary Development

    Uninterrupted revolution means continuously resolving contradictions, continuously overcoming difficulties, and continuously promoting the forward development of things. The Communist Party is a party of uninterrupted revolution. The Party leads the people of the whole country from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and in the future, it will gradually transition from socialism to the highest ideal of mankind – communist society. This process is a process of uninterrupted revolution. Our veteran revolutionaries have consistently and courageously advanced along this path of uninterrupted revolution.
    Yu Yousan, an old Red Army battalion commander from Caihe Commune, Xishui County, Hubei Province, is one of the thousands of uninterrupted revolutionaries. Comrade Yu is now sixty-three years old and has participated in revolutionary struggles for more than thirty years. He was seriously wounded nine times in the war. His neck was pierced by the enemy, his stomach was broken, and his intestines were severed. He was captured and severely tortured by the enemy more than a dozen times. However, he always steadfastly persisted in the revolutionary struggle until the liberation of the whole country. In 1955, Comrade Yu honorably retired from the army and returned to his hometown. At that time, the county party committee wanted him to recuperate in the county seat, but he refused. He said, "I came from the countryside, and I want to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production." After returning to his hometown, he did not become arrogant and complacent because he was a seriously wounded veteran, nor did he enjoy leisure and comfort because he had more than six thousand yuan of demobilization resettlement allowance from the state. He gave more than one thousand yuan of the resettlement allowance to the agricultural production cooperative to buy production tools and fertilizers to solve the cooperative's difficulties, and deposited the rest in the bank to support national industrial construction. He himself participated in agricultural production, earning his living through labor, and took the lead in planting experimental fields. The unit area yield of his experimental rice reached more than a thousand catties. When working on the reservoir construction site, he not only took the lead in labor but also told revolutionary stories to the commune members to inspire their enthusiasm, enabling the reservoir to be completed more than a month ahead of schedule. Wherever Comrade Yu went, the enthusiasm was great, and whatever he did was successful. Our cause is constantly advancing through the efforts of millions of revolutionaries like him who are constantly fighting.
    Uninterrupted revolution is the style of communists. We should all establish and learn this style. To build a communist society, we must establish the thought of uninterrupted revolution. We know that the development of things is the result of the struggle of contradictions. Contradictions are universal. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions appear. Only by continuously resolving contradictions can we promote the forward development of things. Our country is an economically and culturally backward country with "poverty and blankness." To build it into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we must continuously revolutionize. If we stop the revolution halfway, all our previous efforts will be wasted. There are such facts in daily life. Our Beifeng Management Area and Changao’ao Management Area in the commune launched a red flag competition the year before last. Our Beifeng Management Area won the red flag for the first three times. However, some commune members and cadres, lacking the thought of uninterrupted revolution, became dizzy with victory and became arrogant and complacent, saying, "What are we afraid of? We can win even if we don't move. Let's take a break now!" As a result, the fourth red flag was won by Changao’ao Management Area. From this, it can be seen that only by establishing the thought of uninterrupted revolution can we build our country into a great socialist country faster and better.
    With the thought of uninterrupted revolution, we must also have the viewpoint of the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao said: "Every Communist Party member should know that the entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China is a complete revolutionary movement that includes two stages, the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; these are two revolutionary processes of different natures, and only by completing the former revolutionary process is it possible to complete the latter revolutionary process. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution." Chairman Mao taught us that we must not only distinguish the different natures and tasks of each stage of the revolution but also see the close connection between this stage and that stage. We must neither exceed objective laws nor fall behind the situation. This view is of great significance to us today. For example, when running people's communes, some people thought that communism had arrived and wanted to abolish the principle of distribution according to work, resulting in egalitarian errors. Another type of person believes that the socialist collective ownership system is the best system and that there is no need to transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people. The error of these two types of people is that they have not established a viewpoint that combines the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Our Party has always led the people of the whole country in revolution and construction based on the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. After the victory of the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution was immediately carried out. For example, after the rural land reform, mutual aid groups, elementary agricultural production cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives were organized, and in 1958, the people's commune was realized. While vigorously carrying out socialist construction, we are often reminded to see the future of communism and strive to cultivate communist factors. Therefore, we must look at problems according to Chairman Mao's dialectical viewpoint of combining the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. We must see both today and tomorrow so that we can always maintain soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and move from one victory to another.

    既要看到今天　又要看到明天
    ——学习不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的体会
    丁凤英
    不断革命就是不断地解决矛盾，不断地战胜困难，不断地推动事物向前发展。共产党就是不断革命的党。党领导全国人民由民主革命到社会主义革命，将来还要由社会主义逐步过渡到人类的最高的理想——共产主义社会。这个过程就是不断革命的过程。我们的革命老前辈就是这样始终如一地沿着这条不断革命的道路勇猛前进的。
    湖北省浠水县蔡河公社的老红军营长余友三同志，就是千万个不断革命者中的一个。余老伯伯现在六十三岁，参加革命斗争已经有三十多年，在战争中曾负过九次重伤，他的颈子被敌人打穿了，肚子打破了，肠子打断了，十几次被敌人捉去严刑拷打。可是他始终不屈不挠地坚持了革命斗争，直到全国解放。1955年余老伯伯光荣地退伍，回到家乡。当时县委要他在县城内好好休养，可是他不肯。他说：“我是从农村来的，我要回到农村去，参加农业生产。”回乡以后，他没有因为自己是一个身负重伤的老战士而产生任何骄傲自满，也没有因为自己有国家给的六千多元转业安家费而享乐自在。他把国家给他的安家费除了交一千多元给农业生产合作社买生产工具和肥料，解决农业社的困难外，余下的全部存在银行里，支援国家工业建设。他自己参加农业生产，靠劳动吃饭，还带头种试验田，他的试验水稻单位面积产量达到一千多斤。在水库工地干活时，他一面带头劳动，一面向社员讲革命故事，鼓舞社员们的干劲，使水库提前一个多月完成了任务。余老伯伯到哪里，哪里干劲就大，干哪一件事哪一件事就成功。我们的事业，就是在千百万个像他这样始终斗争不息的革命者的努力下不断前进的。
    不断革命是共产党人的风格。我们每个人都应树立和学习这种风格。要建设共产主义社会，就要树立不断革命的思想。我们知道，事物的发展是矛盾斗争的结果。矛盾是普遍存在的，解决了旧的矛盾，新的矛盾又出现了，只有不断地解决矛盾，才能推动事物向前发展。我们国家是一个“一穷二白”的经济文化落后的国家，要建设成一个拥有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，必须不断革命。如果我们中途停止革命，就会前功尽弃。日常生活中就有这样的事实，我们公社北丰管理区和长坳坳管理区，前年开展了红旗竞赛，头三次都是我们北丰管理区夺得了红旗。可是有些社员和干部，由于缺乏不断革命的思想，被胜利冲昏了头脑，产生了骄傲自满情绪，说：“怕什么？我们不动也会赢得胜利，现在歇一歇吧！”结果第四次红旗就被长坳坳管理区夺去了。由此可见，只有树立不断革命思想，才能更快更好地把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    有了不断革命的思想，还必须有革命发展阶段论的观点。二十年前毛主席就说过：“每个共产党员须知，中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，是包括民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段在内的全部革命运动；这是两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。”毛主席教导我们，既要分清革命每个阶段的不同性质和任务，又要看到这个阶段与那个阶段的密切联系。既不能超过客观规律，也不能落在形势的后面。这个观点对我们今天有着重大的意义。比如，在办人民公社的时候，有的人就以为是共产主义到来了，想取消按劳分配的原则，结果犯了平均主义的错误。又有一种人认为，社会主义的集体所有制是最好的制度，再不需要从社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制了。这两种人的错误就是没有树立不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的观点。我们的党一向根据不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的理论，领导全国人民进行革命和建设。在民主革命取得胜利以后，马上就进行了社会主义革命。比如农村土地改革以后，就组织互助组、初级农业生产合作社、高级社，到1958年又实现了人民公社化。在大搞社会主义建设的时候，又经常提醒我们要看清共产主义前途，努力培植共产主义的因素。因此，我们一定要按照毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的辩证观点去看问题，既要看到今天，又要看到明天，这样才能使我们永远保持冲天的革命干劲，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
