    In Coordination with Eisenhower's Conspiracy
    Pro-US Elements in Taiwan Establish New Political Party
    Xinhua News Agency, June 16th, Taipei dispatch: To cooperate with the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas," a group of pro-US elements in Taiwan, with American support, announced on the 15th, on the eve of Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan, the "establishment of a new political party." According to dispatches from Taipei by the American United Press International and Associated Press, these pro-US elements in Taiwan stated that the purpose of their "new political party" was "to permanently eliminate the one-party dictatorship of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique)." The statement also fiercely criticized the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities for "actually using anti-communism merely as an excuse to deprive the people of their constitutional rights and freedoms" and for "adopting various improper measures to monopolize elections," and so on.
    According to the Associated Press, the pro-US elements in Taiwan who signed the statement announcing the establishment of the "new political party" included Lei Zhen, the publisher of the Taiwan "Free China" bimonthly magazine sponsored by Hu Shi, Gao Yushu, the former "Mayor of Taipei" who had just returned to Taiwan after activities in the United States, local Taiwanese power figures, and Li Wanjü, the publisher of the Taipei "Gonglun Daily".

    配合艾森豪威尔阴谋活动
    台湾亲美分子成立新政党
    新华社16日讯　台北消息：配合美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，一批在美国支持下的台湾亲美分子在艾森豪威尔到台湾前夕，于15日宣布“成立一个新政党”。据美国合众国际社、美联社从台北发出的消息，这批台湾亲美分子声明他们成立“新政党”的目的是“旨在永远消灭中国（指蒋介石集团）的一党独裁”。声明中还猛烈抨击台湾国民党当局“实际上反共只是被用来作为一个借口，来剥夺人民的宪法权利和自由”，以及“采取了种种不正当的措施，包办了选举”等等。
    据美联社消息，在这个宣布成立“新政党”的声明上签字的台湾亲美分子，有由胡适主办的台湾“自由中国”半月刊发行人雷震、刚由美国活动后返台的前任“台北市市长”高玉树、台湾地方势力分子、台北市“公论报”发行人李万居等。
