Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 2nd: Forty-two factories in Changchun have completed their first half-year production plans one month ahead of schedule and with above-target results. By the end of May, the output of thirty-six major products from these factories, such as weather-measuring theodolites, generators, pumps for industrial and agricultural use, and glycerin, had completed more than half of the annual plan.

Since the beginning of this year, these factories have extensively and deeply carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, breaking through weak links in production, technology, and management, thereby rapidly changing the face of production. The Municipal Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Plant combined production doubling with product revolution, driving an all-round leap forward in production. The plant not only comprehensively completed its first half-year production plan but also reformed five major products, breaking through three new technologies in the manufacturing of motors and electrical control equipment.

In the technical revolution movement, all factories focused on doubling production, vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, carried out diversified operations, and increased the production of raw and processed materials. The Kuancheng District Nonferrous Metals Smelting Plant increased its output by more than one-third compared to the original plan by trial-producing raw materials such as copper sulfate and aluminum sulfate.

In the campaign to vigorously increase production, all factories paid special attention to strengthening management. They looked ahead after each step, focusing on both output value and volume, quality, cost, labor productivity, and profit delivery plans. In grasping production, many factories achieved early, comprehensive, deep, detailed, and forceful implementation, effectively ensuring the completion of production plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, June 2nd: The Fushun West Open-Pit Coal Mine, which won the Red Flag Award at the National Conference of Heroes, completed half of this year's national coal production plan one month ahead of schedule at zero o'clock on June 1st, exceeding the target by 198 tons. The cost of raw coal was reduced by 2.8% compared to the plan; indicators such as overall efficiency and total output value increased significantly compared to the same period last year, and the amount of extractable coal prepared has increased six times compared to the same period last year.

The West Open-Pit Coal Mine was able to complete half of the annual national plan one month ahead of schedule mainly because the Party committee adhered to putting politics in command. From top to bottom, everyone firmly established the idea of ​​constantly striving for the best and rushing forward in everything, breaking the conventional pattern of slackness at the beginning and tightness at the end of the year and month, and creating a new situation of "a red start, continuous red, and red to the end." Since entering May, the entire mine has focused on vigorously carrying out a revolution in mining methods, driving a comprehensive and systematic technical transformation in all aspects of equipment, transportation, and hoisting. After the coal mining section increased the scoop bucket of 60% of the coal mining electric picks from the original one cubic meter to two cubic meters, the time to load a train of coal was reduced from twelve minutes to six minutes. Workers in the coal preparation plant worked hard for four days to achieve "centralized control and remote control" of coal preparation, simplifying the process, and processing an additional 168 tons of coal per day by operating only a portion of the machinery.

This newspaper reports: As of May 27, the Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province had produced 594,260 tons of high-quality coking coal, completing 56.1% of the annual plan, an increase of 38% over the same period last year. Costs were reduced by 400,000 yuan, pit wood consumption was reduced by 40%, overall efficiency was 24% higher than planned, and the recovery rate reached over 95%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 2nd: Workers at the Liuzhou Coking Plant in Guangxi have completed their first half-year production plan ahead of schedule and with above-target results. As of May 24, the plant's coke production had completed 58.76% of the annual production plan, and labor productivity had increased by 21.4% compared to the same period last year.

Based on the fact that most of the operations in the Liuzhou Coking Plant were manual and involved heavy physical labor, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement focused on solving key and weak links in production, achieving "everyone working together, big and small tasks being grasped together." After more than two months of hard work, by mid-May, a total of 103 innovation projects had been realized in the plant, basically achieving mechanization of in-plant transportation through the use of vehicles and rails, and mechanization of coal washing, coal selection, pulverization, and furnace loading, greatly saving labor and increasing work efficiency by multiples and dozens of times.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 2nd: The Guiyang Paper Mill and the Guizhou Auto Parts Factory have exceeded their first half-year production plans and entered the third quarter more than a month ahead of schedule. Compared with the first half-year plan, the Guiyang Paper Mill's output value exceeded the target by 41.71%, output exceeded the target by 0.91%, and labor productivity increased by 41.71%. All indicators of the Guizhou Auto Parts Factory in the first half of the year were also completed and exceeded ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, with the continuous deepening of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, both factories have seen a moving scene of a red start, daily highs, increasing every ten days, and a leap forward every month. The Guizhou Auto Parts Factory organized workers to carry out technical innovations targeting weak links in production. In more than four months, more than 4,500 technical innovations were realized, including more than 400 that were key, making the production of many processes and products change from manual operation to mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated production, and efficiency rapidly increased. The plant's labor productivity increased by more than 75% compared to the same period last year. The Guiyang Paper Mill's workers vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, conservation through substitutes, and waste utilization, widely using sawdust, shavings, old duck vines, kudzu vines, wheat straw, rags, and other waste materials and wild fibers, solving the raw material problem and ensuring the continuous leap forward in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 2nd: The Qinghai Province Automobile Repair Factory comprehensively completed its first half-year national plan ahead of schedule and with above-target results.

As of May 28, the factory had completed 52.31% of the annual output value plan; the output of major products, labor productivity, profit delivery, and cost plan were all completed very well. Automobile overhauls completed 65.38% of the annual plan, 51 major automobile parts completed 70.54% of the annual plan, and labor productivity increased by 62% compared to the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 2nd: The Yichun Special District Geological Exploration Brigade in Jiangxi Province has completed its annual major production targets eight months ahead of schedule and with above-target results, and has entered 1961.

As of early May, mechanical core drilling, manual impact drilling, manual pit exploration, and shallow well drilling have completed the annual plan with above-target results ranging from 42% to 176%; costs have been greatly reduced, only about one-quarter of the national standard, saving the state a total of more than one million yuan from January to April.

In order to accelerate the exploration speed, the Party committee of the brigade led the workers to focus on innovating drill bits. Young workers of the 302 team under the brigade successfully trial-produced a kind of alloy drill bit, which is very efficient and can drill rocks of level eight or nine. When using alloy drill bits, they also adopted the method of rapid drilling with large water volume, large pressure, and small diameter, which made work efficiency high and safe. On this basis, the leaders of the brigade and branch teams, together with the masses, further innovated and successively created more than 100 new types of drill bit models. After research, experimentation, and improvement, more than 70 types are now used for drilling, achieving the goal of having the most powerful drill bit to deal with any kind of rock. In addition, they also adopted the "no blasting method," which greatly saves manpower and accelerates the drilling speed.
