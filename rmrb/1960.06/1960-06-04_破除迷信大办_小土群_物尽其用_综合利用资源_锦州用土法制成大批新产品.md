This newspaper reports from Shenyang on June 3rd: The Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the masses to vigorously run "small indigenous group" factories. In just over three months, the city used simple equipment and methods to set up more than 900 factories, successfully trial-producing more than 1,000 new products that the city had not been able to produce in the past. Due to the mass production of a large number of new products, the total output value of small and medium-sized enterprises has rapidly increased.

The great achievement of Jinzhou's vigorous promotion of "small indigenous groups" and the creation of new products is the result of the city's people breaking superstition, greatly developing a daring spirit, and thinking big. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision to build Jinzhou into a comprehensive industrial city at the fastest speed. The policy was self-reliance and starting with indigenous methods. Workers, housewives, cadres, and students throughout the city enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Committee. The radio factory, which had just been merged from repair cooperatives, insisted that its employees build semiconductor radios. At that time, they didn't have equipment. They adopted the method of concentrating technical forces, one master leading many apprentices, and old apprentices leading new apprentices, and rushed to make it. In less than a month, they produced 77 pieces of indigenous equipment, and more than 200 sets of instruments and molds; as a result, in addition to electronic tubes and loudspeakers, the original parts of semiconductor radios were manufactured. Currently, they have been put into mass production.

Jinzhou is a city with a relatively concentrated petroleum industry, light industry, and chemical industry, and has a lot of waste, waste liquid, and waste gas. Based on this characteristic, the slogan of "eating and squeezing clean, making the best use of everything" was put forward from the beginning. The vigorous promotion of "small indigenous groups" has opened up broad avenues for comprehensive utilization. The employees of the food company have used the waste from pigs, cattle, and sheep to make 31 kinds of medicines such as liver extract injections. The output value of these products is very high, and each food factory has already achieved or is approaching the point where by-products exceed the main products.

In Jinzhou's mass movement to vigorously promote "small indigenous groups" and fiercely attack new products, the secretaries of the Party committees, from the Municipal Committee to the factory and mine Party committees, took the lead. The city launched a communist large-scale collaboration. Each factory and mine divided the projects for trial-producing new products into many battlefields, and each battlefield was combined with cadres, workers, and technicians. Establish collaborative organizations such as "research institutes" and "shock brigades." Because the movement was organized, led, purposeful, and planned, it was both vigorous and orderly, and yielded extremely rapid results. Only ten days after the movement began, more than 300 new products, such as optical glass, were manufactured.

In order to seize the time for trial production, each unit did not build production plants at the beginning. After the new products came out, proving that they could be mass-produced, they spent two or three days building simple factory buildings, and then continuously renovated them as production developed. The Tiebei Chemical Plant was the first to produce caustic soda and petroleum jelly in large pots and vats. Then they collected waste bricks and wood, built factory buildings, and put them into normal production. After that, the workers modified waste oil drums to make pipes and cylinders, installed pressure gauges, realized semi-automation, saved 21 people, and doubled production efficiency. Now the factory has built more than 20 permanent factory buildings, and production has increased several times compared to the original plan.

    破除迷信大办“小土群”　“物尽其用”综合利用资源
    锦州用土法制成大批新产品
    本报沈阳3日电　中共辽宁省锦州市委发动群众大办“小土群”工厂。仅仅三个多月，全市用简单的设备和方法，办起了九百多座工厂，试制成功了本市过去不能生产的一千多种新产品。由于大量新产品的成批投入生产，中小企业的总产值迅速提高了。
    锦州大办“小土群”大造新产品的巨大成就，是全市人民大破迷信，敢想敢干风格大发扬的结果。去年第四季度，中共锦州市委就作出决定，要以最快的速度，把锦州市建设成为一个综合性的工业城市。方针是自力更生，土法上马。全市工人、家庭妇女、干部和学生、热烈响应了市委的号召。刚由修配合作社合并起来的无线电厂，职工们一定要造半导体收音机，当时没有设备，他们采取了技术力量大集中，一师带多徒，以老徒带新徒的办法，突击赶制，不到一月，制出了七十七台土设备，二百多套仪表和模具；结果，除电子管和扬声器外，半导体收音机原件制造出来了。目前已成批投入生产。
    锦州市是石油工业、轻工业和化学工业比较集中的城市，废物、废液、废气很多。根据这个特点，一开始就提出了“吃光轧净，物尽其用”的口号。大办“小土群”一开始，就为综合利用开辟了广阔的道路。食品公司的职工已用猪牛羊的废物，制成了肝精注射液等三十一种药品，这些产品产值很高，各食品厂已经作到或接近作到了副产超主产。
    锦州在大搞“小土群”，猛攻新产品的群众运动中，从市委到厂矿党委，都是书记挂帅。全市开展了共产主义大协作。各厂矿都按试制新产品的项目，分成好多战场，每个战场都由干部、工人、技术人员结合起来。建立“研究院”“突击队”等协作组织。由于运动有组织、有领导、有目的、有规划，因此，搞得既轰轰烈烈，又有条不紊，收效极快。运动刚刚开始十天，就制成了光学玻璃等三百多种新产品。
    各单位为了抓紧试制时间，开头未建生产厂房，新产品出来以后，证明能成批生产，即花二、三天时间，搭简陋的厂房，随着生产的发展，再不断进行改建。铁北化工厂最先在大锅、大缸里制出了火碱和凡士林。接着自己收集了废砖木，搭了厂房，投入了正常生产。此后，工人们又改制废油桶，作管道和汽缸，安上压力表，实现了半自动化，节省了二十一个人，生产效率提高了一倍。现在这个厂已盖了二十多间永久性的厂房，生产比原计划翻了好几番。
