The bloody feud of the Taiwanese People
Jun She

June 27, 1950, is the day when American imperialism openly ordered its Seventh Fleet to occupy our territory, Taiwan, by force.

Ten years ago today, then-US President Truman issued this order to occupy Taiwan by force in Washington. The current US President Eisenhower even went directly to Taiwan ten days ago to carry out aggressive activities. The facts of these ten years before and after show that the nature of American imperialism has not only not changed, but as it approaches its demise, its aggression is becoming more and more frenzied.

For ten years, under the armed aggression of American imperialism, our ten million Taiwanese compatriots have lived a dark and miserable life. On the 35,000 square kilometers of Taiwan's land, there are traces of American bandits harming the Taiwanese people everywhere. The US Department of Defense regards Taiwan as a springboard for attacking mainland China and threatening Asian security. Shortly after the Seventh Fleet invaded the waters off Taiwan, the Pentagon drew up a map in July 1950 entitled "Uncle Sam (America) is the world's policeman," in which Taiwan was listed as a US sea and air force base, fleet base, and army garrison. Since then, the United States has successively established in Taiwan the Military Assistance Advisory Group responsible for controlling the Chiang army, the Advanced Command Post of the Thirteenth Air Force stationed in Taiwan and the Fifth Air Force stationed in Taiwan, responsible for threatening our country from the air, the US Naval Second Medical Research Center responsible for studying bacteriological warfare, and the "US Naval Auxiliary Committee Center" responsible for intelligence and subversive activities. There are more than 20 independent American military institutions on this island, and the number of personnel in each institution is increasing year by year. They are linked, coordinated and commanded by the "US Taiwan Defense Command," the US military command in Taiwan, forming an American military network for invading Taiwan. Currently, there are more than 10,000 American military and political aggressors living in Taiwan. The officers and soldiers of the Seventh Fleet cruising in the Taiwan Strait and often landing in seaports such as Kaohsiung and Keelung are not included. These American aggressor troops commit all kinds of evil in Taiwan, including murder, arson, drunkenness, robbery with guns, drug trafficking, rape of women, and reckless driving.

Thousands of villages have been razed to ruins, and the US invading army has occupied hundreds of thousands of hectares of fertile land and orchards, turning thousands of villages into ruins, and enclosing them with barbed wire to build US military barracks, air force bases, "Matador" missile bases, artillery shooting ranges, bacteriological and chemical warfare testing grounds, etc. Many mountainous areas have also been closed off by the American occupation forces to build radar stations. This kind of criminal violent occupation measure by the US invading army has forced tens of millions of Taiwanese people to become homeless, landless, wives and children separated, and living without support for ten years.

As American invading troops poured into Taiwan, a large number of American politicians, diplomats, secret agents, and thugs also carried out various political conspiracies in Taiwan. They used the US "Embassy" in Taiwan as the command and dispatching agency, and in Taiwan, they searched for and bought a group of lackeys who were willing to work for the US in creating the conspiracies of "Taiwan independence" and "trusteeship of Taiwan," and suppressing the Taiwanese people's anti-American struggle was the top priority for the Americans in carrying out political conspiracies in Taiwan. To this end, the US Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a large number of special agents to Taiwan and colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek Group to set up American-style concentration camps in Huoshao Island, Lanyu and other places, and set up a "Criminal Experiment Building" in Taipei. Over the past ten years, they have detained, tortured, persecuted, and massacred tens of thousands of Taiwanese anti-American patriotic compatriots.

American imperialism is also carrying out all-pervasive economic plunder in Taiwan, sucking the marrow and blood of the Taiwanese people and plundering Taiwan's wealth. Under the auspices of the huge "US International Cooperation Administration Taiwan Branch" and the "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" established by the United States in Taiwan, the United States controls and penetrates Taiwan's industry, mining, transportation, agriculture, fishery, forestry, animal husbandry and other aspects under the guise of "economic assistance." Over the past ten years, the United States' "economic assistance investment" in Taiwan has reached more than one billion US dollars. The "US aid investment" in Taiwan's power industry system alone accounts for two-thirds of the total capital of this industrial sector in Taiwan. Taiwan has had trade deficits in import and export trade for years, and the market is flooded with American goods. Every year, thousands of factories, mines, and shops are closed down or bankrupted due to the exclusion and打击of American capital, or are sealed up, auctioned, or annexed by the US because they cannot repay the "US aid mortgage loan principal and interest" with high interest rates. The US "Agricultural Reconstruction Committee" is carrying out various vicious destruction against Taiwanese farmers. It uses methods such as controlling water resources and fertilizers to deliberately reduce Taiwan's grain production so that the United States can dump more surplus agricultural products to Taiwan. The US poisonous plan has brought serious food shortages to Taiwan at present, making more people fall into famine. In addition to the official "economic assistance" from the United States, many large American companies have also penetrated Taiwan's industrial and mining industries in the name of "private investment," plundering wealth and seeking exorbitant profits.

American imperialism is carrying out cultural aggression in Taiwan through both channels. On the one hand, through institutions such as the United States Information Service and the American Asia Foundation, it transports a large number of adulterous and thieving movies, pictorials, and comic books that promote the "American way of life" and American "civilization" to Taiwan, used to corrode the minds of the Taiwanese people, attempting to wear down their will to resist. On the other hand, the United States bought a small group of comprador literati, such as Hu Shi and Mao Zishui, and thousands of so-called "missionaries" sent by the United States to Taiwan, who used occasions such as "preaching" and "lecturing" to attack nationalism and patriotism as so-called "conservative, old-fashioned, and stubborn thoughts" (Hu Shi), and advocated that Taiwan "should wholeheartedly support the US strategy, avoid making it difficult for the United States as much as possible, so that the United States can calmly schedule" (Mao Zishui). The emergence of this kind of American "cosmopolitan" fallacy is an attempt to first enslave the Taiwanese people in terms of ideological consciousness before the United States prepares to completely turn Taiwan into its colony.

The aggression carried out by the United States in various aspects of military, political, economic, and cultural affairs is the root cause of all the sufferings of the Taiwanese people. Under the violent persecution and widespread establishment of concentration camps by the United States, the safety of the lives of the Taiwanese people is not guaranteed, and there is no freedom to speak of. Under the cultural aggression of the United States, Taiwan's social atmosphere is very corrupt. Various brothels and bars are lined up, and cases of pornography and homicide occur from time to time. The problem of juvenile delinquency is becoming more serious year by year, causing many parents to worry every day that their children will not be able to withstand the corruption of the "American way of life" and degenerate, thus being frightened. The United States' all-pervasive economic plunder of Taiwan has caused serious damage to Taiwan's economy. Famine is everywhere on the fertile land, and the ranks of the unemployed are expanding year by year. According to Taiwan's traditional customs, there is a "winter relief" before the Spring Festival every year, distributing money and rice donated from various parties to beggars, vagrants, and starving people to express relief. Before the Spring Festival in 1951, there were 540,000 beggars, vagrants, and starving people in Taiwan, but before the Spring Festival this year, it has increased to more than 1.4 million. The dramatic increase in beggars and starving people in Taiwan is entirely the evil result of the invasion by American bandits. These more than one million compatriots who have no place to stand are all farmers and fishermen who have been bankrupted under the destruction of the US "Agricultural Reconstruction Committee," unemployed workers in industrial and mining enterprises that have been squeezed out and closed down by American capital, and the vast rural population who have been displaced because their homes have been occupied by the US military as military restricted zones. In Taiwan, more than a dozen or even dozens of poor people commit suicide every day because they have no way to make a living, and family suicides have occurred repeatedly. 250,000 Taiwanese compatriots suffered from severe tuberculosis under the torment of painful lives, and more than 30,000 were forced into madness.

The armed occupation of Taiwan by American aggressors and the countless atrocities they have committed cannot but arouse fierce resistance from the Taiwanese compatriots who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle. According to the materials of the Taiwan police revealed by Zhang Jiuru, a "legislator" of the Taiwan Kuomintang, from June 1950 to June 1958, there were a total of 310,000 so-called "subversion" cases of various sizes in Taiwan, most of which were related to anti-Americanism. That is to say, in the 313 townships in Taiwan's 22 counties and cities, on average, hundreds of anti-American incidents occur every day. Among them, the most prominent was the anti-American demonstration that broke out in May 1957, which shocked the world. It fully demonstrated the deep hatred of the Taiwanese people for American aggressors. The recent strikes and slowdowns by workers of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation in Keelung City and the Asia Aviation Company in Tainan City against American aggressors, the struggle of Taiwan industrial circles against American capital opening textile factories in Taiwan, the "Buy Local Products Movement" launched by people from all walks of life in Taiwan, etc., are all part of the anti-American struggle that has been rising one after another for the past ten years by the Taiwanese people.

Before and after the "plague god" Eisenhower visited Taiwan, although the US military invading Taiwan and the police and special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek Group strengthened their vigilance and intensified the implementation of various special agent terror measures. However, the unyielding patriotic compatriots in Taiwan still posted slogans such as "Drive away the American aggressors" and "Swear to oppose the US conspiracy of 'Taiwan independence'" on utility poles and walls in various places. On the barbed wire of the US military restricted zones, wooden signs with "This is Chinese territory" hung by Taiwanese patriots are often found.

The determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan is unwavering, and the strong will of the Taiwanese people to demand Taiwan's return to the motherland is also unshakable. The Taiwanese people's struggle against American imperialism has the strong motherland as its backing and the support of the people all over the world. The deep hatred of the Taiwanese people must be compensated! American imperialism must get out of Taiwan!

    台湾人民的血泪仇
    军舍
    1950年6月27日，是美帝国主义公然命令它的第七舰队武装侵占我国领土台湾的日子。
    十年前的今天，当时的美国总统杜鲁门在华盛顿发出了这个武装侵占台湾的命令。现在的美国总统艾森豪威尔，更在十天前直接跑到台湾进行侵略勾当。这十年前后的事实，说明了美帝国主义的本性不但没有变，而且随着它的日益接近死亡，它的侵略行为越来越疯狂。
    十年来，在美帝国主义的武装侵略下，我国一千万台湾同胞过着暗无天日的水深火热的生活。三万五千多平方公里的台湾土地上，到处是美国强盗残害台湾人民的血迹。美国国防部把台湾作为进攻中国大陆和威胁亚洲安全的跳板，第七舰队侵入台湾海面不久，五角大楼就在1950年7月绘制了一幅名为“山姆叔叔（美国）是世界的警察”的地图，其中把台湾列为美国的海、空军根据地、舰队根据地和陆军驻扎地。此后，美国陆续在台湾建立了负责控制蒋军的军事援助顾问团、负责从空中威胁我国的第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部和第五航空队驻台机构、负责研究细菌战的美国海军第二医学研究中心、负责进行情报和颠覆活动的“美国海军辅助委员会中心”等。在这个海岛上，独立的自成体系的美国军事机构一共有二十多个，每个机构的人员也一年比一年增多。它们由名为“美国台湾防御司令部”这个侵台美军司令部负责联络、调度和指挥，构成了一个美国侵台军事网。现在，住在台湾的美国军政侵略人员共有一万多人。巡戈在台湾海峡并且常常在高雄、基隆等海港登陆的第七舰队官兵，还没有包括在内。这些美国侵略军在台湾杀人放火、酗酒闹事、持枪抢劫、贩运毒品、强奸妇女、飞车害人，无恶不作。
    千计的乡村被铲为废圩，侵台美军霸占了成千上万公顷的良田和果园，把数以千计的乡村变为废墟，围上了铁丝网建造美军兵营、空军基地、“斗牛士”导弹基地、炮兵射击场、细菌战和化学战的试验场等等。许多高山地区也被美国占领军封山来建立雷达站。美国侵略军这种罪恶的暴力侵占措施，十年来迫使千千万万的台湾人民无家可归、无田可耕，妻离子散，生活无依。
    随着美国侵略军涌入台湾，大批美国的政客、外交官、特务和恶棍也在台湾进行各种政治阴谋活动。他们以美国驻台湾“大使馆”为发号施令机关，在台湾搜罗和收买一批甘心为美国制造“台湾独立”和“托管台湾”的阴谋效犬马之劳的走狗，而镇压台湾人民反美斗争，更是美国人在台湾进行政治阴谋活动中居首位的勾当。为此，美国中央情报局和联邦调查局等，派遣了大批特务人员去台湾，勾结蒋介石集团在火烧岛、兰屿等地设立美式集中营，在台北设立“刑事实验大楼”，十年来拘押、酷刑迫害和屠杀了数以万计的台湾反美爱国同胞。
    美帝国主义更在台湾进行无孔不入的经济掠夺，吸吮台湾人民的膏血和劫取台湾的财富。在庞大的“美国国际合作署台湾分署”和美国在台湾设立的“中国农村复兴联合委员会”的主持下，美国以“经济援助”为名控制和渗入台湾的工业、矿业、交通运输业、农业、渔业、林业、畜牧业等各个方面。十年来，美国在台湾的“经援投资”已达十亿美元以上。单是台湾动力工业系统中的“美援投资”，即占了台湾这一工业部门资金总额的三分之二。台湾在进出口贸易中连年入超，市场上美国商品充斥。每年都有成千上万家工厂、矿场和商店因受着美国资本的排挤、打击而关门倒闭，或者因为欠下了高利贷的“美援抵押贷款本息”无法清偿，被美方查封拍卖或吞并。美国的“农复会”对台湾农民进行着各种毒辣的摧残，它用控制水力资源和肥料等办法，有意使台湾粮食减产，以便美国能向台湾倾销更多的剩余农产品。美国的毒计已给目前的台湾带来严重的粮荒，使更多的人陷于饥馑。除了美国官方的“经济援助”以外，美国许多大公司还以“私人投资”的名义渗入台湾的工矿业，掠夺财富，牟取暴利。
    美帝国主义双管齐下地对台湾进行文化侵略。它一方面通过美国新闻处、美国亚洲基金会等机构，把大量宣扬“美国生活方式”、美国“文明”的奸淫邪盗的电影、画报、小人书等运往台湾，用来腐蚀台湾人民的心灵，企图消磨他们的反抗意志。另一方面，美国收买了一小撮买办文人胡适、毛子水等，与几千名美国派往台湾的所谓“传教士”一起，利用“布道”、“讲学”等场合，攻击民族主义和爱国主义都是所谓“保守、守旧、顽固的思想”（胡适），鼓吹台湾“应该一心一意的拥护美国的策略，尽可能避免使美国为难，使美国得以从容调度”（毛子水）。这一类美国的“世界主义”谬论的出现，是美国准备把台湾完全变为它的殖民地以前，企图先从思想意识方面奴化台湾人民。
    美国从军事、政治、经济、文化各个方面进行的侵略，是台湾人民一切苦难的根源。在美国的暴力迫害和广泛建立集中营的政策下，台湾人民的生命安全失去保障，更没有自由可言。在美国的文化侵略下，台湾的社会风气十分败坏，各种妓院、酒吧林立，色情、凶杀等案件不时发生，少年犯罪问题一年比一年严重，使许多做父母的人，天天都耽心儿女经不起“美国生活方式”的腐蚀以致堕落，因而提心吊胆。美国对台湾无孔不入的经济掠夺，已使台湾的经济受到严重的摧残。丰饶的土地上饿莩遍野，失业的队伍一年比一年扩大。按照台湾的传统风俗，每年春节前都有一次“冬赈”，把各方捐赠的钱和米分给乞丐、流浪汉和饥民，表示救济。1951年春节前，台湾的乞丐、流浪汉和饥民有五十四万人，今年春节前竟增加到一百四十多万人。台湾乞丐和饥民的急剧增加，完全是美国强盗侵略所造成的恶果。这一百多万贫无立锥之地的同胞，都是被美国“农复会”摧残下破产的农民和渔民，被美国资本挤垮倒闭了的工矿企业的失业职工，以及因家园被美军霸占为军事禁区而弄得流离失所的广大乡村人口。在台湾，每天都有十多名甚至几十名贫民因求生无门而自杀，并且一再发生全家自杀的惨剧。二十五万台湾同胞在痛苦生活的煎熬下患了严重的结核病，三万多人被逼成疯癫。
    美国侵略者武装霸占台湾和犯下层出不穷的暴行，不能不激起具有反帝爱国斗争光荣传统的台湾同胞激烈的反抗。据台湾国民党“立法委员”张九如在一次讲话中透露的台湾警方材料，从1950年6月到1958年6月，台湾各地发生大大小小的所谓“颠覆”案件共有三十一万件，其中绝大部分与反美有关。也就是说，在台湾二十二个县、市的三百一十三个乡镇中，平均每天都有成百件反美事件发生。其中最突出的是1957年5月爆发的震动世界的反美大示威。充分表现了台湾人民对美国侵略者的深仇大恨。最近基隆市台湾造船公司、台南市亚洲航空公司工人举行的反对美国侵略者的罢工、怠工斗争，台湾工业界人士反对美国资本到台湾开设纺织厂的斗争，台湾各阶层人民展开的“爱用本地货运动”等等，都是十年来台湾人民彼伏此起、接连不断的反美斗争的一部分。
    在“瘟神”艾森豪威尔访问台湾的前后，尽管侵台美军和蒋介石集团的警察、特务加强戒备，加紧施行各种特务恐怖措施。但是，不屈不挠的台湾爱国同胞仍然在各地的电线杆子上、墙壁上张贴“赶走美国侵略者”、“誓死反对美国搞‘台湾独立’的阴谋”等标语。在美国军事禁区的铁丝网上，还常常发现被台湾爱国者挂上“这是中国领土”的木牌。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾的决心是坚定不移的，台湾人民要求台湾回到祖国怀抱的强烈意志也是不可动摇的。台湾人民反对美帝国主义的斗争有着强大的祖国为后盾，有着全世界人民的支持。台湾人民的深仇大恨一定要取得报偿！美帝国主义一定要滚出台湾去！
