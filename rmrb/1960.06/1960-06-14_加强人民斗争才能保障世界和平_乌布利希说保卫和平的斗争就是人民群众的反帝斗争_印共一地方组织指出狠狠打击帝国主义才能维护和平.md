Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 11th: According to a report in "Neues Deutschland" on the 10th, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, recently said at a representative meeting of the Leipzig district party organization that the current struggle to defend peace is a struggle of the masses of the people against imperialist aggression. He also said that the struggle to defend peace must be carried out by the masses of people who desire peace and oppose the imperialist aggressive groups that attempt to obstruct peaceful coexistence.

Ulbricht, when talking about the international situation after the Paris Four-Power Summit was sabotaged by the United States, said that the lesson of Paris is that the US government expects to dominate the world and dreams of implementing aggressive measures against other countries with impunity, but this plan is contrary to the world balance of power. It is useless to treat the Soviet Union with atomic diplomacy and intimidation. The US government must respect the sovereignty of other countries.

Ulbricht condemned Adenauer for supporting the US government's policy of sending spy planes to invade other countries, and condemned him for being obsessed with arms expansion and war preparation and for striving to maintain the vestiges of World War II. Ulbricht said that the Paris incident should teach Adenauer that the West German ruling clique cannot realize their aggressive plans even with the help of the United States.

Ulbricht said that the German question cannot be resolved as long as West German militarization is not prevented; the German people cannot live in peace without eliminating the vestiges of war. There can be no peace if there are US military bases in West Germany and West Berlin, and if West Berlin continues to be under the occupation of the Western Three Powers. If the Western Three Powers governments truly want to maintain peace, then they should prove this by eliminating the vestiges of war.

Ulbricht spoke about the economic and cultural development of the German Democratic Republic. He called on everyone to further improve all aspects of social life.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 11th: According to a recent issue of the Indian "New Age" weekly, a resolution passed by the West Bengal State Committee of the Communist Party of India at a meeting held from June 1st to 5th emphasized that world peace cannot be maintained without severely打击 every conspiracy of imperialism.

The resolution said that in order to avoid the danger of war, it is necessary for Asian countries to unite and resolutely oppose the imperialist policies of the US government.

The resolution expressed deep anger at the US imperialists' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit and emphasized the great role of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in defending peace.

Regarding the Indian government's attitude towards the US sabotage of the Four-Power Summit, the resolution said that it is regrettable that the Indian government did not lodge a strong protest to the US government. On the contrary, Nehru wanted both the US government and the Soviet government to be responsible for the failure of the Four-Power Summit.

    乌布利希说保卫和平的斗争就是人民群众的反帝斗争
    印共一地方组织指出狠狠打击帝国主义才能维护和平
    新华社柏林11日电　据“新德意志报”10日报道，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希最近在来比锡专区党组织的代表会议上说，目前保卫和平的斗争是人民群众反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。他又说，一定要由希望和平和反对企图阻挠和平共处的帝国主义侵略集团的人民群众来进行保卫和平的斗争。
    乌布利希在谈到巴黎四国首脑会议被美国破坏以后的国际形势时说，巴黎的教训是，美国政府指望独霸世界和妄想对其他国家实行侵略措施而不受惩罚，但是，这种打算是同世界力量对比相矛盾的。用原子外交和恫吓的办法来对待苏联是毫无用处的。美国政府必须尊重其他国家的主权。
    乌布利希谴责阿登纳支持美国政府派间谍飞机侵犯别国的政策，谴责他醉心于扩军备战和力求保持第二次世界大战的残迹。乌布利希说，巴黎事件应当教训阿登纳：西德统治集团即使靠美国的帮助也实现不了他们的侵略计划。
    乌布利希说，只要西德军国主义化没有受到阻止，德国问题就不能得到解决；不消除战争残迹，德国人民就不能过和平生活。如果在西德和西柏林有美国军事基地，如果西柏林继续处在西方三国占领之下，那就谈不上和平。如果西方三国政府真正希望维护和平的话，那么它们就应当以消除战争残迹来证明这一点。
    乌布利希谈到了德意志民主共和国经济和文化的发展问题。他号召进一步做好社会生活一切方面的工作。
    新华社新德里11日电　据最近一期的印度“新世纪”周报报道，印度共产党西孟加拉邦委员会在6月1日到5日举行的会议上通过的一项决议强调指出，如果不狠狠打击帝国主义的每一个阴谋，就不能维护世界和平。
    决议说，为了避免战争的危险，亚洲各国有必要团结一致地、坚决地反对美国政府的帝国主义政策。
    决议对于美帝国主义者破坏四国首脑会议的行为深表愤怒，并且着重指出以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对于保卫和平的巨大作用。
    决议在谈到印度政府对于美国破坏四国首脑会议的态度时说，遗憾的是，印度政府没有向美国政府提出强烈的抗议，相反，尼赫鲁却要美国政府和苏联政府都对四国首脑会议开不成负责。
