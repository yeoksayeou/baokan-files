Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 31st. Former Indian National Congress President Dhebar, in an article published in the "Tribune" on May 30th, repeated the slander that China is "committing aggression" and clamored that "India will not consider talks or negotiations as long as this aggression exists and until this aggression is withdrawn."

Dhebar absurdly demanded that China "respect" India's unreasonable demands, saying that "before further discussions, China should withdraw from the territory that India claims as its own."

Dhebar opposed people's hopes for resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute through peaceful consultation. To this end, he deliberately spread fallacies, saying, "Subjective wishes cannot produce this peace. It is wrong to create a scenario of such hope when there is no basis for hope."

To further incite anti-China hysteria, Dhebar clamored for "concerted efforts to educate world opinion and concerted efforts to strengthen internal forces." He fantasized that the world would believe his fabricated notion that the so-called "Chinese aggression" tendency "is not only dangerous to India but also dangerous to world peace."

    印度前国大党主席德巴煽动反华
    污蔑中国“侵略”　反对边界会谈
    新华社新德里31日电　前印度国大党主席德巴5月30日在“论坛报”发表的文章中，重复中国“进行侵略”的谰言，并且叫嚷，“在这种侵略撤退以前，印度在存在着这种侵略的情况下不会对会谈或谈判作什么考虑”。
    德巴居然荒唐地要中国“尊重”印度的无理要求，说什么“在作进一步的讨论以前，中国应当撤出印度声称是它的领土”。
    德巴反对人们对于通过和平协商解决中印两国边界争端的希望，为此，他刻意散播谬论说，“主观愿望是不能产生这种和平的。在希望没有什么基础的时候，创造这种希望的情景是错误的。”
    为了进一步煽动反华歇斯底里，德巴叫嚷要“一致努力来教育世界舆论，一致努力来加强内部的力量”。他幻想要世界相信他杜撰的所谓“中国侵略”的倾向“不仅对印度有危险，而且对世界和平有危险。”
