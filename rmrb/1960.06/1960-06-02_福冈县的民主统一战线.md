    The Democratic United Front in Fukuoka Prefecture
    Guan Zhengwen, Deputy Secretary-General of the "Fukuoka Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent Revision and Abolition of the 'Security Treaty'"
    Fukuoka Prefecture is the political center of Kitakyushu, Japan. As early as February 1958, the people of Fukuoka Prefecture, through vigorous struggle, forced Foreign Minister Fujiyama's attempt to organize a national symposium on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" issue in Fukuoka to a disgraceful failure. Following this struggle, in April 1959, the Fukuoka Prefecture organizations of "Sohyo" [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan], the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Peace Committee, the Japan Farmers' Federation, and the Japan-China Friendship Association established a preparatory committee for the Fukuoka Prefecture People's Joint Struggle Conference Against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the same time, during the prefectural governor's election, the preparatory committee mobilized its affiliated units to thoroughly expose the anti-China policy of the Liberal Democratic Party and the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The democratic forces finally defeated the Liberal Democratic Party candidate by a majority of 70,000 votes. Amidst the further development of the national democratic united front, the Fukuoka Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference was officially established in May of the same year. The chairman of the Socialist Party's Fukuoka Prefecture Committee served as chairman, and the chairman of the Communist Party's Fukuoka Prefecture Committee and the chairman of the "Sohyo" Fukuoka Prefectural Council served as vice-chairmen. After the formation of the united front, the people of Fukuoka Prefecture launched a massive anti-American patriotic struggle, rising wave upon wave from the first united action. If only six industrial unions participated in the first united action, then ten industrial unions already participated in the second united action, and from the third united action onward, it rapidly increased to sixteen industrial unions. At this time, half of the twenty cities in the prefecture had organized regional joint struggle conferences. By the fifth united action, all cities in the prefecture had organized regional joint struggle conferences, and joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty" also began to be organized in towns, villages, and grassroots units. On the day of the fifth united action, a 10,000-person prefectural rally was held in Fukuoka City. After this united action, the joint struggle system against the "Security Treaty" was continuously strengthened, forming the four major joint struggle zones of Fukuoka, Chikuho, Kitakyushu, and Chikugo. Moreover, in addition to small cities, 120 joint struggle organizations were organized at the grassroots level such as towns, villages, and school districts. Housewives, farmers, doctors, intellectuals, and ordinary residents all participated in these organizations. In the sixth united action, the Fukuoka Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference, responding to the call of the central organization, held seminars to cultivate cadres for joint struggle organizations in various regions, towns, villages, and school districts, as well as activists in various workplaces, in order to truly make the joint struggle organization the foundation of the national democratic united front. In this way, by the seventh united action, almost all levels of people had joined the struggle against the "Security Treaty." After the eleventh united action, the people of Fukuoka, like the people of the whole country, focused on opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and preventing the Diet from ratifying this treaty, launching a larger-scale struggle. Currently, the working class of Fukuoka Prefecture intends to take strike action to protest against Nobusuke Kishi's fascist war policy and the forceful "passage" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    福冈县的民主统一战线
    日本“福冈县阻止修改和废除‘安全条约’共同斗争会议”事务局次长  关正文
    福冈县是日本北九州的政治中心。早在1958年2月福冈县人民就以强有力的斗争迫使藤山外相在福冈组织日美“安全条约”问题全国恳谈会的企图遭到可耻的失败。经过这次斗争以后，1959年4月“总评”、社会党、共产党、和平委员会、日本农民联合会以及日中友好协会在福冈县的组织，成立了福冈县人民反对日美“安全条约”共同斗争会议筹备委员会。与此同时，在县知事选举中筹备委员会动员所属单位彻底揭发自由民主党敌视中国政策和日美“安全条约”的侵略实质。民主力量终于以七万票的多数战胜了自由民主党候选人。在民族民主统一战线的进一步发展中，同年5月福冈县共同斗争会议正式成立。社会党福冈县委员长担任议长，共产党福冈县委员长和“总评”福冈县评议会议长担任了副议长。在统一战线结成后，福冈县人民从第一次统一行动起一浪高一浪地掀起了巨大的反美爱国斗争。如果说第一次统一行动时，只有六个产业工会参加，那末第二次统一行动就已经有十个产业工会参加，从第三次统一行动起更迅速地增加到十六个产业工会。这时县内二十个市的半数已组织了地区共同斗争会议。到第五次统一行动时，县内所有城市都组织了地区共同斗争会议，而且在镇、村及基层单位也开始组织反对“安全条约”共同斗争组织。在第五次统一行动日，福冈市召开了一万人的全县大集会。在这次统一行动后，反对“安全条约”共同斗争体系不断加强，形成了福冈、筑丰、北九州、筑后四大共同斗争区，而且除了小城市以外，镇、村、学区等基层也组织起一百二十个共同斗争组织。家庭主妇、农民、医生、知识分子和一般居民都参加了这种组织。在第六次统一行动中，福冈县共同斗争会议响应中央组织的号召，为了使共同斗争组织真正成为民族民主统一战线的基础，举办讨论会来培养各地区、镇、村、学区共同斗争组织的干部和各个工作场所的积极分子。就这样，在第七次统一行动时，几乎各阶层人民都已投入了反对“安全条约”的斗争。从第十一次统一行动以后，福冈人民和全国人民一样，把反对日美军事同盟条约和阻止国会批准这一条约作为重点来开展更大规模的斗争。目前，福冈县工人阶级要以罢工的实力行动来抗议岸信介的法西斯战争政策和强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”。
