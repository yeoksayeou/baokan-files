    Smash This Bloodsucking Leech
    By Kang Langshuai, a Dai ethnic singer

    Thousands of rivers and tens of thousands of rivers surged into a torrent. People all over the world wielded gigantic iron palms, and the raging storm shook the earth in shock, warning the American bandit Eisenhower: Don't even think about igniting the flames of war, the gigantic palms of hundreds of millions of people will surely smash this bloodsucking leech! Look! The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, under the banner of red flags, roar loudly: Get out, American bandits! Get out, bloodsucking leeches! From now on, there will be no place for imperialism to stand in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is the century of the people, hundreds of millions of people holding hands, walking towards the direction where the sun rises. The sun has awakened us, and the sun has given us wisdom and strength. The suffering people have stood up, overturning two mountains with one hand. (Note) The people of Asia have awakened, who dares to oppress us again? Look! A prairie fire of anger burns for thousands of miles, and ten thousand cannons fire to send away the plague god. Draped in the morning glow, circling the sun, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, hold our hands tightly, let us unite like close brothers, and let us once again warn the American bandits: if you dare to extend your claws of aggression towards our doors and windows, we will surely turn your bones into mud!

      (Note) The two mountains refer to imperialism
          and feudalism.

    捣碎这条吸血的蚂蟥
    傣族歌手　康朗甩千条河，万条江，掀起了汹涌的巨浪。全世界人民挥起钢铁的巨掌，愤怒的风暴把地球惊震得摇
  晃，警告美国强盗艾森豪威尔，休想把战火点燃，亿万双人民的巨掌，定会捣碎这条吸血的蚂蟥！看！亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的
  人民，红旗招展下，高声怒吼：滚出去，美国强盗！滚出去，吸血的蚂蟥！从此亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲再没有帝国主义立足的地方。这是人民的世纪，亿万人民手拉着手，朝着太阳升起的方向行走。太阳使我们觉醒了，太阳给予我们智慧和力量。受苦的人民站立起来了，一手推翻两座山。（注）亚洲人民醒来了，谁敢再欺压我们？看！怒火燎原烧万里，万炮齐鸣送瘟神。披着朝霞，绕着太阳，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民，紧紧的拉起我们的手来，让我们团结得像亲亲的兄弟，让我们再一次的警告美国强盗：你胆敢把侵略的魔掌伸向我们的门窗，定叫你尸骨化成泥浆！
      （注）两座山是指帝国主义
          和封建主义。
