Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: To overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, force the dissolution of the Diet, and smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, six million workers in 111 industrial sectors in Japan held the largest general strike in Japanese history today. Simultaneously, 60,000 shops across Japan held a one-day strike today, and many school teachers and students went on strike in support of the general strike.

A spokesman for the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) announced that in addition to member unions of "Sohyo" and the Federation of Independent Unions, many other trade union organizations participated in this political general strike. The number of participants reached about 85% of Japan's 7,080,000 organized workers, exceeding the previous three general strikes. This general strike by the Japanese working class has dealt a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The main force of this general strike was the National Railway Workers' Union, the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, and the Japan Federation of Municipal Transport Workers' Unions. Most of Japan's trains, trams, and buses were out of service this morning.

The militant National Railway Workers took the lead in launching the strike today. From the time of the first departure in the morning until 7:00 AM, they halted trains at 70 railway hubs nationwide and held workplace rallies. The Tokaido Line, one of Japan's largest railway lines, was completely shut down before 7:00 AM, and many trains on the Sanyo, Tohoku, Joetsu, Shinetsu, Tokiwa, and Kagoshima lines were stopped or delayed. It is reported that 1,259 trains were stopped nationwide and 1,072 trains were delayed, the largest number of stopped and delayed trains in the history of the Japanese National Railways.

In Tokyo, the capital of Japan, 146 trains were completely shut down. To support the railway workers' general strike, approximately 40,000 members of other trade unions and students entered more than 50 important stations and electric train areas in Tokyo, including Shinagawa, Ueno, Ikebukuro, and Tachikawa, from 10:00 PM last night, forming picket lines to guard against sabotage by the Kishi Nobusuke government and fascist groups. Despite the pouring rain, the workers and students were in high spirits. They sang labor songs and chanted slogans such as "Smash the Security Treaty!" and "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" University professors, cultural figures, and ordinary citizens also participated in the picket work at various stations in Tokyo to support the strike. At the Tokaido Station, monks wearing clerical robes were also sitting on the platform to support the workers' strike.

Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, and other leaders went to various important stations in Tokyo this morning to encourage the workers' strike. Nosaka addressed the workers and people from all walks of life, pointing out the great significance of today's general strike in combating the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the importance of organizing a caretaker cabinet that includes all parties except the Kishi Nobusuke group. He called on everyone to be vigilant and prevent the emergence of a second Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Leading cadres and members of the Diet from the Socialist Party also went to various stations to encourage the striking workers.

Striking workers and people from all walks of life held rallies together at various stations. The rallies passed resolutions stating that they would fight to the end to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, force the dissolution of the Diet, and smash the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At 7:00 AM, the strike ended victoriously amidst the singing of labor songs by workers and people from all walks of life, hand in hand.

Yamaada Hajime, Secretary-General of the National Railway Workers' Union, said in a statement on the strike that railway workers exercised their right to resist the people's enemy, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Through this strike, the people will force Kishi Nobusuke to step down sooner. He expressed gratitude for the support of people from all walks of life. He emphasized: We vow to further consolidate cooperation with people from all walks of life in order to continue to develop the struggle together with people from all strata gathered around the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," and to build a democratic and peaceful Japan.

In the private railway sector, 62 unions of major private railway companies such as Tobu and Keihin in Tokyo, Hanshin, Kyoto, and Keihanshin in Kansai held a full-scale strike from the time of the first departure this morning until 6:30 AM. In addition, unions of 60 small and medium-sized private railway companies across the country also held scheduled strikes in the driver departments from the first train.

The Japan Federation of Municipal Transport Workers' Unions held workplace rallies in various places. The National Automobile Transport Workers' Union held scheduled strikes.

In the private sector, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Japan Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All Japan Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation, the All Japan Free Labor Union, the National General Contract Workers' Union Federation, the All Japan Temporary Workers' Union, and the National Miscellaneous Workers' Union held 24-hour strikes in various places today. The All Japan Harbor Workers' Union and the All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union held scheduled strikes. The All Japan Express Workers' Union and many other industry unions held one to two-hour workplace rallies, respectively.

The Japan Teachers' Union held two-hour strikes and workplace rallies from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, and held general membership meetings in every city, town, and village.

Today, government officials and workers in other public utilities departments who have been deprived of the right to strike by the Japanese government also participated in the general strike by holding workplace rallies.
