Blood Will Not Be Shed in Vain
    Liu Baiyu

    These past few days, we have been living in heroic times that have shaken the world. Last night, at a gathering with the Japanese literary delegation, including Noma Hiroshi, Kamei Katsuichiro, and Matsuoka Yoko, we received the news that Eisenhower had been forced to postpone his "visit" to Japan. This immediately sparked enthusiastic applause. Everyone rejoiced at the victory the Japanese people had already achieved and were encouraged by the greater victories to come.

    After returning home, I read telegrams from Tokyo. One of them was a statement from Professor Toshio, the father of Kanba Michiko, the martyr cruelly murdered by the Kishi Nobusuke government on the 15th. He said, "She died in a mass national movement. As a father, I feel very grieved at losing my youngest child. But she did not die as a result of frivolous actions, and this is my only comfort. I also went to the Diet on the afternoon of the 15th and witnessed the police suppression. I could not restrain my inner anger, but I did not expect that my daughter would be killed at that time." After reading this, we cannot help but feel sorrow and indignation. A pure, innocent young woman, under the fascist's insane and barbaric atrocities, dedicated her blood and life to her suffering motherland.

    We must deeply remember the hot blood of Kanba Michiko shed in the Japanese Diet. She was murdered by American imperialism and its running dog, Kishi Nobusuke. But all historical experience tells us that the blood of revolutionary pioneers is never shed in vain. As Lu Xun said in an article written in 1926, which he noted was "the darkest day since the founding of the Republic of China": "Blood is neither obscured by written lies nor intoxicated by written elegies; its power cannot be suppressed either, because it can no longer be deceived, nor can it be killed." Blood can tell the truth to hundreds of millions of people, encourage struggle; blood has always illuminated people's path forward; blood will surely bring about the innovation and progress of society and the world. We will not forget: the people of the Paris Commune shed blood, but with extraordinary heroism, they opened up a new century of great revolution; Russia's "Bloody Sunday" led to the October Revolution, the birth of the first socialist country; the countless heroic sacrifices of revolutionaries in a series of revolutionary struggles in China, such as the March 18th and December 9th movements, earned us the glorious victory we have now. Similarly, the Tokyo bloodbath on June 15th can only be a precursor to the final collapse of reactionary rule and a signal that the people are creating history according to their own will. There is no doubt that blood will be like a spark, igniting even greater anger, igniting even more violent storms in the hearts of all Japanese people and all people around the world.

    A few days ago, I wrote the following passage in a manuscript: "The Japanese people, over such a long period of time, have waged fierce, heroic, and increasingly intense struggles, full of invaluable and lovable revolutionary spirit and heroism. This makes the Japanese people's struggle the forefront of the world's anti-imperialist struggle. It is this unparalleled heroic behavior that has made the Japanese people reach the most beautiful and heroic height in the eyes of people all over the world in centuries. As literary workers, we sincerely express our congratulations and respect to such heroic people. Because from all this, we clearly see that our era is becoming younger, overflowing with the vitality of fighting youth. Struggle is opening up a new path from the corruption and stagnation of monopoly capitalists and imperialists. People who were suffocated in that kind of stuffiness can hold their heads high, shine their eyes, breathe freely, and shout freely. This great revolution, this great storm, is continuing and unfolding, and it cannot have any other result than to thoroughly cleanse the world of filth and blood. What a heroic era! The people are deciding everything, and the despicable running dogs can only end up with the fate of despicable running dogs: Syngman Rhee secretly fled by plane before dawn, Menderes is imprisoned on a small island, Kishi Nobusuke laments that it 'keeps me from sleeping,' and Eisenhower, Nixon, and Herter are shaken day and night by the roars of people all over the world. What a magnificent era! The old world is collapsing, and the new world is growing stronger. The revolutionary storm is blowing relentlessly. 'The East wind prevails over the West wind' is no longer a prediction, but a poem; this poem brings a glorious era."

    The struggle is advancing rapidly, and time seems to be running out. The manuscript is not yet finished, but now I should add the most important sentence here, that is: The blood of Japanese martyrs has made this struggle, this era, more solemn, more inspiring, and more brilliant.

    Blood will not be shed in vain. The Japanese people and the Japanese nation should be immensely proud to have such a strong and heroic daughter. Just look at the reactions after the 15th to understand the truth that "a single spark can start a prairie fire." The Kishi Nobusuke government held a series of emergency meetings from late at night. When the news of this bloody suppression reached Manila, the secret agents protecting Eisenhower were greatly panicked. When the notice of the postponed "visit" was delivered to Eisenhower, who was conducting a military review, his "face turned very heavy," which reportedly made the remaining schedule of Eisenhower's "Asian trip" "fall into chaos." Yes, it is the imperialist world that is panicking and in chaos, while among the Japanese people, it has aroused an even more vigorous and fierce anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle. Throughout the world, people fighting for justice are issuing even greater calls for sympathy and support. Yes, it was Kanba Michiko who used her life to open a new page in the Japanese people's struggle, from opposing the new "Security Treaty" to opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. Now, it has entered the peak of the struggle to expose the fascist bloody crimes of the Kishi Nobusuke clique and completely smash the Kishi Nobusuke's shameless traitorous and reactionary rule. The struggle is surging and advancing. The heroism of this struggle has attracted and encouraged the people all over the world who are striving for liberation, for peace, and against imperialism. The eyes of the people all over the world are watching Tokyo, and the hearts of the people all over the world are beating with the cries of the Tokyo demonstration teams. The fire of blood has been ignited. The heroic banner of the Japanese people's struggle has been raised higher. The just struggle of the Japanese people and the people of the world will surely advance victoriously and achieve even greater and more glorious victories.

    血是不会白流的
    刘白羽
    我们这些时日以来，是生活在震撼世界的英雄时日里。昨晚，同日本文学家代表团野间宏、龟井胜一郎、松冈洋子诸位聚会时，收到艾森豪威尔被迫延期
  “访问”日本的消息，立刻引起一阵热烈的掌声，大家为日本人民已经取得的胜利而欢腾，为将要取得的更大胜利而鼓舞。
    回家以后，读东京来的电讯，其中一则，是15日被岸信介政府残酷杀害的烈士——桦美智子的父亲中大教授俊雄的谈话。他说：“她是在国民群众运动当中死去的。作为父亲来说，失去最小的孩子是感到非常悲痛的。但是，她不是由于轻浮的行动的结果而死亡，唯有这一点还是仅有的安慰。我也在15日下午到过国会，亲眼看到警察镇压的情形，抑制不住内心的忿怒，然而没有料想到自己的女儿会在当时被杀死了。”读了这段话，我们不能不沉痛，更不能不愤慨。一个纯洁、无辜的女青年，就这样在法西斯疯狂野蛮暴行之下，把她的鲜血和生命奉献给自己的苦难中的祖国了。
    我们必需深刻地记住桦美智子洒在日本国会院内的热血。她是被美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介所屠杀了。但是全部历史经验告诉我们：作为革命先驱者的鲜血，从来是不会白流的。正如鲁迅于1926年，在注明为“民国以来最黑暗的一天”写的一篇文章中说：“血不但不掩于墨写的谎语，不醉于墨写的挽歌；威力也压它不住，因为它已经骗不过，打不死了。”血，可以在亿万人民中诉说真理，鼓励斗争；血，从来是照亮人们前进道路的；血，必将换取得社会、世界的革新与进步。我们不会忘记：巴黎公社人们流了血，但是他们以非凡的英雄气概开辟了一个大革命的新世纪；俄国的“血的星期日”导向十月革命，第一个社会主义国家的诞生；中国“三·一八”“一二·九”一系列革命斗争中无数志士的壮烈牺牲，换得了现在这个辉煌的胜利；同样，6月15日东京的血案，只能是反动统治最后崩溃的预兆，也是人民按照自己意志创造历史的信号。毫无疑问，血会像一星星火花，在全日本人民、全世界人民心中，燃烧起更强大的愤怒，燃烧起更猛烈的风暴。
    几天前，我在一篇文稿中写了这样一段话：“日本人民在这样长时间内，顽强的、英勇的、一浪比一浪更高的怒火冲天的斗争，充满何等可贵可爱的革命精神，英雄气概。这使得日本人民的斗争成为全世界反帝斗争的最前线。正是这种无可比拟的英雄行为，使得日本人民在全世界人民心目中，达到了几世纪以来，最美丽、最英雄的高度。作为一个文学工作者，我们衷心地向这样英雄的人民表示我们的祝贺、敬意。因为从这一切之中，我们清楚地看到：我们的时代变得更年轻了，它洋溢着战斗的青春的活力。斗争正在从垄断资本家、帝国主义的腐败与沉闷中开辟了一条新鲜的道路。原来窒息在那种气闷中的人，可以昂起头、闪亮眼睛，自由呼吸，自由呐喊了。这种大革命、大风暴，正在继续，正在展开，它不可能有旁的结果，它必定要把世界上的肮脏、血污来个大大的清洗。这是多么英雄的时代呀！人民在决定着一切，卑鄙的走狗只能得到卑鄙走狗的下场：李承晚乘天尚未明时分乘飞机偷偷逃跑了，曼德列斯囚禁在一个小小的海岛上，岸信介哀叹着‘使我睡不好觉’，艾森豪威尔，尼克松，赫脱，每日每夜为全世界人民的怒吼声所震撼着。这是多么壮丽的时代呀！旧世界在崩溃，新世界在壮大。革命的风暴不停息地猛吹着。‘东风压倒西风’早已不是一句预言，而是一句诗；这一句诗，带来一个光辉的大时代。”
    斗争在飞速的前进，时间好像都有些赶不上，文稿尚未写就，现在我却应该在这里加上一句最重要的话，那就是：日本牺牲者的鲜血，使得这个斗争，这个时代，变得更庄严、更高昂，更灿烂了。
    血是不会白流的。日本人民，日本国家应该以自己有这样刚强、壮烈的女儿为无尚的骄傲。只要看一看15日后的反映就可懂得“星星之火，可以燎原”的真理了。岸信介政府从深夜起连续召开紧急会议，当这一血腥镇压消息传到马尼拉，为艾森豪威尔“保镖”的特务人员大为惊慌；被迫延期“访问”的通知送到正在进行军事检阅的艾森豪威尔手上时，他“面色变得很沉重”，据说使艾森豪威尔“亚洲之行”的其余日程已经“陷于混乱”。是的，陷于惊慌与混乱的是帝国主义世界，而在日本人民中间则激起了更加旺盛、更加炽烈的反美反岸斗争。在全世界为正义斗争的人民中发出更大的同情与支援的呼声。是的，是桦美智子，用她的生命揭开日本人民斗争崭新的一页，由反对新“安全条约”到反对艾森豪威尔“访”日，现在已经进入揭露岸信介集团法西斯血腥罪行，彻底粉碎岸信介无耻卖国的反动统治的斗争高峰了。斗争在汹涌澎湃地冲击着，前进着，这种斗争的英雄气概吸引了、鼓舞了全世界争取解放、争取和平、反对帝国主义的人民。全世界人民的眼睛都在望着东京，全世界人民的心都随同东京示威队伍的呼声而跃动。血的火光已经点燃起来了。日本人民斗争的英雄旗帜举得更高了。日本人民和全世界人民的正义斗争必将乘胜前进，取得更巨大的胜利，更辉煌的胜利。
