　　This newspaper reports that farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang love public canteens. At present, the number of people participating in canteens accounts for 97% of all farmers and herdsmen in the region. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels, attention to planned grain consumption, and continuous rectification of organization and improvement of management, the more than 30,000 canteens in the region are becoming more and more consolidated.
　　Xinjiang has a lot of arable land, and the actual labor force engaged in agricultural production is responsible for an average of more than 25 mu of arable land per person. After the large-scale establishment of public canteens and other collective welfare undertakings, approximately 800,000 women in the region (equivalent to one-third of the region's labor force) were freed from household chores and投入 into agricultural production; collective meals facilitate the management and organization of labor, and now it is common practice everywhere to ensure that work starts promptly; public canteens implement a grain supply system and develop domestic production, greatly improving the lives of the vast number of farmers and herdsmen. According to surveys, the food quality of more than 80% of the canteens in the region has reached the living standards of wealthy middle peasants in the area before collectivization.
　　Xinjiang's vast pastoral areas stretch for thousands of miles, and public canteens play an even greater role in ensuring that hundreds of thousands of herdsmen have enough to eat and greatly promote production. Since the establishment of the canteens, the lives of the herdsmen have generally undergone significant changes. In the past, herders of all ethnic groups often had difficulty accessing enough grain because of the vastness of the pastoral areas and transportation difficulties, especially in high-altitude pastures where they rarely ate grain throughout the summer, subsisting only on meat and dairy products. After the establishment of the canteens, the communes specially organized transport teams to ensure that the canteens and fuel could be supplied in a timely manner, completely changing this situation. Now, canteens in pastoral areas have generally begun to grow vegetables, adding variety to meals. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups are eating well and have plenty of energy, and livestock production is experiencing an unprecedented prosperity.
　　As soon as canteens were established in various parts of Xinjiang, the Autonomous Region Party Committee emphasized the need to conserve grain and plan consumption. During the autumn harvest last year, in order to further consolidate the canteens and effectively prevent grain waste, the Regional Party Committee, based on the successful experiences of some regions and with reference to the number of diners in each canteen, the national grain ration standards, and the agricultural seasons, uniformly arranged the annual grain consumption plan for each canteen in the brigade to ensure the annual grain supply for commune members. Practice has proven that with planned supply and regulation of grain by the communes and brigades, the lives of commune members can be well arranged. The major brigades in Shanshan County plan the annual grain supply for commune members based on the principle of eating more during the busy farming season and less during the slack season. This area has a particularly large amount of melons, fruits, and vegetables in the summer. With the consent of the commune members, the brigades saved three kilograms of grain per person per month during the three months of last summer, and supplied more grain to the canteens during the busy spring planting season, thus ensuring that old grain was connected with new grain, and the commune members ate well throughout the year.
　　Party committees at all levels continuously rectify the canteens, ensuring their consolidation ideologically and organizationally. The Autonomous Region Party Committee has always adopted a resolute attitude of adhering to the development and actively running rural public canteens well. Over the past year or so, party committees at all levels have conducted four major rectifications of the canteens. Through the rectifications, canteen management systems have been established and improved; the class line has been implemented, and the dominance of poor and lower-middle peasants in the canteens has been established (poor and lower-middle peasants account for 90% of the canteen administrators in the region); and the grain rations of commune members have been properly arranged. The Autonomous Region Party Committee also stipulates that the secretary of the county party committee and commune party committee in charge of living welfare must devote their main energy to running the canteens; and all grassroots cadres must eat in the canteens. In the process of rectifying public canteens, party committees at all levels have also paid special attention to using the leadership method of launching mass movements in a big way, and continuously carrying out mass-based comparison and competition. Over the past year or so, approximately one-third of the 150,000 canteen workers in the region have been commended and rewarded through heroes' conferences and representatives' meetings of advanced collectives and advanced producers at the autonomous region, county, and commune levels, greatly stimulating their enthusiasm for running the canteens well.
　　Xinjiang is a vast region, and agricultural areas are often separated by hundreds or even thousands of miles of deserts. Uyghur villages are mostly scattered, and the land is not contiguous. In order to adapt to this situation, the scale of canteens in various places also varies depending on the size of the production team, generally around 150 people, with the largest having more than 300 people, and the smallest canteens in production teams near the edge of the desert Gobi having about 20 or 30 people. Canteens are also flexibly organized according to the agricultural season and production scale to meet needs. During the winter and summer seasons, when hundreds of thousands of people are concentrated on building water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, and rushing to harvest the summer crops, field canteens, mobile canteens, and construction site canteens are set up to ensure that canteens go wherever production goes. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 canteens were set up during the large-scale water conservancy construction and wasteland reclamation movement last winter and this spring, serving production as the production army set up camp. In the Ili and Altay grasslands, during the tense lambing season in spring, when livestock herds are relatively close, canteens are mostly organized by livestock production teams; in summer, when livestock herds move to high-altitude pastures and graze dispersedly, canteens are organized by grazing groups. In order to solve the transportation difficulties in high-altitude pastures, production brigades or production teams have specially organized transportation teams to deliver grain, vegetables, and various items to each canteen on a regular basis. In winter, livestock herds mostly graze near farmland and settlements, so winter canteens have spacious dining halls to ensure that people can eat hot meals even in winter. In mixed ethnic farming and pastoral areas, some canteens are run separately and some are run jointly according to the opinions of commune members of various ethnic groups. (Attached picture)

    实行计划用粮　不断整顿提高　组织形式灵活多样
    新疆农牧区食堂越办越好
    农牧民97％参加食堂　八十万妇女走出家庭投入生产
    本报讯　新疆各族农牧民热爱公共食堂，目前参加食堂的人数占全区农牧民的97％。由于各级党委加强领导，注意计划用粮，不断整顿组织和提高经营管理水平，使全区三万多个食堂越办越巩固。
    新疆耕地多，实际参加农业生产的劳力每人平均负担耕地二十五亩以上。公共食堂和其他集体福利事业大量举办以后，全区大约有八十多万个妇女（相当于全区劳动力的三分之一）摆脱了家务琐事，投入了农牧业生产；集体吃饭，便于劳动力的管理和组织，现在各地普遍做到了出工齐、上工快；公共食堂实行粮食供给制，发展家底生产，使得广大农牧民的生活大大改善，据调查，全区80％以上食堂饭菜质量达到了公社化以前当地富裕中农的生活水平。
    新疆的广大牧区绵延数千里，公共食堂更起到了保证数十万牧民吃饱吃好，大大促进生产的作用。食堂建立以来，牧民生活普遍发生了显著的变化。过去各族牧民常常因为牧区辽阔，交通运输困难，特别在高山牧场，整个夏季很少能吃到粮食，只能吃点肉类和奶品。食堂成立后，各公社专门组织起运输小组，保证食堂和燃料等物品能及时供应，才彻底改变了这种状况。现在牧区的食堂已普遍开始种菜，增添了饭菜花样，各族牧民吃的饱吃的好，生产劲头越来越足，畜牧业生产出现了以未有过的繁荣景象。
    新疆各地食堂一建立，自治区党委就强调节约用粮，计划消费。去年秋收期间，区党委为了进一步巩固食堂，并有效防止粮食浪费，又根据一些地区的成功经验，参照各个食堂用餐人数和国家规定的口粮标准和农事季节，统一安排大队各个食堂全年的用粮计划，保证社员全年的口粮供应。实践证明，公社和大队有计划供应和调剂粮食，就可以很好安排社员生活。鄯善县各大队根据农忙多吃农闲少吃的原则，计划好社员全年的用粮供应。这个地区夏季瓜果蔬菜特别多，大队征得社员的同意，在去年夏季三个月中，每人每月节约了三斤粮食，而在春播农忙季节，则供应食堂较多的粮食，这样便保证了陈粮接上新粮，一年四季社员吃得饱吃得好。
    各级党委对食堂不断进行整顿，从思想上组织上保证食堂的巩固。自治区党委对于农村公共食堂，一直是采取了坚持发展和积极办好的坚决态度。一年多来，各级党委对食堂进行了四次大整顿。通过历次整顿，建立和健全了食堂管理制度；贯彻阶级路线、树立了贫农和下中农在食堂中的优势（全区食堂管理员中，贫农和下中农占90％）；切实安排好社员的口粮。自治区党委还规定县委、公社党委管生活福利的书记，要用主要精力抓食堂；基层干部一律到食堂吃饭。在整顿公共食堂的过程中，各级党委还特别注意运用大搞群众运动的领导方法，不断开展群众性的评比竞赛。一年多来，在自治区、县、社三级，通过群英会、先进集体和先进生产者代表会，表扬和奖励的食堂工作人员约占全区十五万食堂工作人员的三分之一，大大激发了他们办好食堂的积极性。
    新疆地区辽阔，农业区多被纵横几百里甚至千里的沙漠隔离。维吾尔族农村又多是居住分散，地不连片。为了适应这种情况，各地食堂规模也因生产小队的大小有所不同，一般都在一百五十人左右，最大的有三百多人，靠近沙漠戈壁边缘的生产队食堂最小，大约有二、三十人。食堂还根据农时和生产规模，灵活地组织以适应需要。在冬夏两季几十万人集中兴修水利、开荒造田和突击夏收期间，这时就办起了田头食堂、流动食堂、工地食堂，做到生产到哪里食堂到哪里。据不完全统计，去冬今春在大修水利和开荒运动中，就有三千多个食堂，随着生产大军安营下寨，为生产服务。伊犁和阿勒泰草原，在春季紧张的接羔季节，畜群比较靠近，食堂便多以畜牧生产队为单位组织起来；夏季畜群转移到高山牧场，分散放牧，食堂便以放牧小组为单位组织起来。为了解决高山牧场交通运输的困难，生产大队或生产队都专门组织了运输队、组，巡回给各个食堂运送粮食蔬菜和各种物品。在冬季，畜群多靠近农田和定居点附近牧放，因此冬季食堂都建有宽敞的饭厅，保证在冬季也能吃到热菜热饭。在多民族杂居的农牧区，还根据各民族社员的意见，有的分开办了食堂，有的办了联合食堂。（附图片）
