    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 5th: Henan Province is proceeding with both summer harvesting and summer planting, presenting an excellent situation. From south to north, from plains to mountains, the province is a scene of flying sickles and whirring machines. Harvesters and planters are working day and night in the fields. By June 2nd, over 20 million mu of summer crops had been harvested, more than 10 million mu more than the same period last year. The province has also planted over 5 million mu of late autumn crops while combating drought, and timely management is underway.
    The characteristics of this year's summer harvest in Henan Province are: fast harvesting and thorough gleaning. Xinxiang Prefecture launched a "Five Cleans" (clean reaping, gathering, transporting, threshing, and sweeping) and "Three No-Losses" (no stalks left in the fields, no ears lost on the roads, and no grains lost at the threshing ground) campaign during the summer harvest. Communes and brigades organized four teams for reaping, gathering, transporting, and threshing, to reap, gather, transport, and thresh concurrently. Kaifeng Prefecture organized 270,000 auxiliary laborers to gather wheat, implementing a system of contracted plots, assigned by person and row, with reasonable remuneration. One to two work points were awarded for gathering one jin of wheat, with special personnel assigned to inspect and accept the work, resulting in excellent wheat harvest quality. Xuchang Prefecture implemented a one-stop operation method for reaping, transporting, threshing, and re-gleaning, putting forward slogans such as "Seize sunny days and arrange skillfully" and "Wheat must be harvested as soon as it ripens, and no wheat should be left by the threshing ground," making the district's wheat harvest fast and good.
    In order to harvest and plant quickly and well, the scale of support for summer harvesting and planting from all sectors in Henan Province this year is larger than any previous year. Cadres from government offices, workers from factories, officers and soldiers from the military, and teachers and students from schools have organized large numbers of expeditions and shock brigades to support the summer harvest. Many government offices have 70% to 80% of their cadres participating in summer harvest support work. Many urban people's communes have also mobilized and organized large numbers of city residents to go to the countryside to help with the rush harvest. In Nanyang, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang prefectures alone, over one million urban laborers are supporting the summer harvest and planting.
    The summer harvest cooperation between communes and brigades is also well-organized. Prosperous teams support poor teams, teams with abundant labor support teams with less labor, and mountain areas support plains, creating a strong atmosphere of mutual assistance. According to statistics from 430 production teams in 32 communes in Luoyang Prefecture alone, over 30,000 mu of wheat have already been harvested through cooperation.
    In order to accelerate the speed of summer harvesting and planting and ensure the quality of summer harvesting and planting, a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on reforming and creating summer harvesting and planting tools has emerged in various places. Changyuan County alone has 3,156 large carts and 7,000 small carts participating in transportation, basically eliminating manual carrying in the county's summer harvest and planting. Yanshi County has invested more than 650 various types of indigenous and foreign harvesters, threshers, and power-driven threshing machines, 89 sets of machine-pulled rollers, and 430 stone rollers installed with bearings, enabling some brigades to basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in summer harvesting.
    Since mid-May, the drought situation in Henan Province has developed from south to north. In order to overcome the drought and plant adequately and well, Xinxiang Prefecture has drawn 200,000 laborers to continue building machine wells and drainage and irrigation stations on a large scale, and seized favorable opportunities to vigorously promote water storage and irrigation. The district has now rushed to plant over 300,000 mu while preserving soil moisture.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 6th: People's communes in various parts of Guizhou are widely organizing commune members to sun and re-thresh wheat stalks and rapeseed stalks that have already been harvested and threshed, striving to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary. In many areas, rapeseed and wheat are re-threshed twice, generally yielding an additional five jin or so per mu. Kaili County re-threshes harvested rapeseed stalks, resulting in an average increase of 5% to 10%. Jingnan Commune in Xingren County widely launched a small-scale summer harvest campaign during the final stages of the summer harvest, recovering more than 15,000 jin of rapeseed and 72,000 jin of wheat in five days.
    This year, the planting area of wheat and rapeseed in Guizhou Province is larger than any previous year, and the growth is also better than in previous years. In order to ensure that the fruits of the harvest are returned to the granary and to achieve a bumper harvest and increase production, Party organizations at all levels in the province attach great importance to careful harvesting and threshing work, emphasizing that: In the summer harvest where "rushing to harvest is like rushing to grab treasure," the more strained the labor force and the fewer the sunny days, the more attention should be paid to careful harvesting and threshing. They also used facts to educate the masses, explaining the principle of "many grains make a heap, many drops make a river." The Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture calculated a detailed account. If careful reaping, threshing, and harvesting are achieved, the prefecture is expected to increase rapeseed production by more than 3.6 million jin and wheat production by more than 9 million jin. Therefore, the broad masses of commune members realize that: the more abundant the harvest, the more careful the harvest must be; only with careful harvesting can a full harvest be achieved. This has reversed the erroneous perception of some who originally thought that with a bumper summer harvest, it didn't matter if a little was lost. Weng'an County has also assigned the responsibility for re-harvesting and re-threshing to production teams and individuals, implementing a "three-package" system of contracted re-threshing, contracted yield, and contracted cleanliness.

    河南夏粮收得快收得细  贵州复收复打颗粒归仓
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省夏收、夏种齐头并进，呈现出一片大好形势。全省从南到北，从平原到山区，目前处处银镰飞舞，机声达达，收割机、播种机日夜在田间转动。到6月2日，全省有两千多万亩夏收作物已收割登场，比去年同期多收割了一千多万亩；全省已抗旱播种晚秋作物五百多万亩，并且及时进行管理。
    河南省今年夏收的特点是：收得快、收得细。新乡专区在夏收中开展了“五净”（割、拾、运、打、扫净），“三不丢”（地里不丢株、路上不丢穗、场边不丢粒）运动。各个公社、大队都组织收、运、打、拾四套人马，随收、随拾、随运、随打。开封专区组织二十七万名辅助劳力拾麦，实行分片包干，按人分垅，合理计酬，拾一斤麦子记工一分到二分，并组织专人检查验收，麦收质量很好。许昌专区开展收割、运输、脱粒、复收一条龙作业法，提出抢晴天、巧安排，做到麦熟不隔晌、场边不丢麦等口号，全区麦收搞得又快又好。
    为了快收快种、收好种好，今年河南省各地各行业支援夏收夏种的规模，比以往任何一年都大。机关干部、工厂工人、部队官兵、学校师生，组织了大批远征队、突击队支援夏收，很多机关70％到80％的干部都参加了支援夏收工作。许多城市人民公社也都动员组织了大批市民，下乡帮助抢收。仅南阳、开封、新乡三个专区，城市支援夏收夏种的劳动力就有一百多万人。
    各地社与社，队与队之间的夏收协作也搞得好。富队支援穷队，劳力多的队支援劳力少的队，山区支援平原，蔚然成风。仅据洛阳专区三十二个公社四百三十个生产小队统计，已协作收麦三万多亩。
    为了加快夏收、夏种速度，保证夏收、夏种质量，各地出现了以改制、创制夏收夏种工具为中心的技术革新、技术革命高潮。仅长垣一个县就有三千一百五十六辆大车、七千辆小车投入运输，全县在夏收夏种中，基本上消灭了人挑肩担的现象。偃师县投入麦收的各式土、洋收割机、脱粒机、动力打场机有六百五十多部，机带磙八十九套，安装了轴承的石磙四百三十部，使一部分大队的夏收工作基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。
    河南省从5月中旬以来，由南到北，旱情又有发展。新乡专区为了战胜干旱，及时种足种好，全区抽出二十万名劳力继续大搞机井和排灌站，并抓住有利时机，大抓蓄水灌溉，全区现已抢墒播种了三十多万亩。
    新华社贵阳6日电　贵州各地人民公社广泛组织社员，对已收割脱粒的小麦秸、油菜秆进行翻晒复打，力争颗粒归仓。许多地区的油菜、小麦经过复打二道，一般每亩可多收五斤左右。凯里县对收割的油菜秆进行翻晒复打，平均增收5％到10％。兴仁县敬南公社在夏收扫尾工作中，广泛开展小夏收运动，五天就收回油菜籽一万五千多斤，小麦七万二千多斤。
    今年贵州省小麦、油菜种植面积比以往任何一年都大，生长也比往年好。为了使丰收果实颗粒归仓，做到丰收丰产，全省各级党组织十分重视细收细打工作，强调指出：在“抢收如抢宝”的夏收中，劳力越紧张，晴天越少，就越要注意细收细打。并用事实向群众进行教育，说明“聚沙成塔，滴水成河”的道理。黔东南苗族侗族自治州算了一笔细账，如果做到细割细打细收，全州预计可增收油菜籽三百六十多万斤，小麦九百多万斤。因此，广大社员认识到：越是丰收，越要细收；只有细收，才能全收。这就扭转了那些原来认为夏收大丰收了，丢掉一点没关系的错误认识。瓮安县还把复收复打的责任落实到生产队和人，实行了包复打、包产量、包干净的“三包”制度。
