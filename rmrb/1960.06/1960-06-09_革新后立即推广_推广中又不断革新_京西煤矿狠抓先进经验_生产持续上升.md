Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Jingxi Mining Bureau vigorously promotes advanced experiences, immediately promoting them after successful innovations, and continuously innovating during the promotion process, resulting in a continuous rise in production levels. In the first five months of this year, the mine comprehensively overfulfilled the five major indicators of output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and pit prop consumption. Compared to January, the average daily output of raw coal in May increased by 10.5%, labor productivity increased by 28%, raw coal cost decreased by 20.9%, and pit prop consumption decreased by 45.9%.

Since the beginning of this year, the bureau has achieved numerous innovations in coal extraction, tunneling, transportation, and saving raw materials. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the employees of the entire bureau exchange information and learn from each other, forming a new communist ethos of valuing learning and helping others. When the employees of the Datai Mine heard that the Longquan Wushi Limestone Mine had successfully created a new rock drilling method, they immediately sent people to learn it and promoted it overnight. It was truly like a spring breeze bringing hundreds of flowers into bloom. The next morning, all the pneumatic drills in the mine were using this new technology, increasing rock drilling efficiency by 100%. After the Wangpingcun Mine created a crane device, knowing that the Anjiatan Mine urgently needed this equipment, they quickly produced one and sent it over. After the Fangshan Mine successfully innovated the underground electric tram line, various mines immediately sent more than one hundred electromechanical workers to support them. It took only four hours to complete the entire 3,900-meter line modification project. This promotion team reformed the electric tram lines of five other mines in one week, saving 8,570 meters of copper wire.

The great revolution in coal mining methods is the central link in increasing coal production. Within two months, the bureau promoted new coal mining methods for both steeply inclined and gently inclined coal seams. The Muchengjian Mine successfully created the "three-free working face" (no people, no pit props, no electric chutes) coal mining method, reducing the previous thirteen coal mining procedures to three, increasing coal mining efficiency by 150%, reducing costs by two-thirds, and reducing personnel by 55%. 80% of the steeply inclined working faces that should be promoted throughout the bureau have adopted this new coal mining method. The employees of the Chengzi Mine successfully tested the "integrated coal mining and tunneling" method on gently inclined coal seams, increasing coal mining efficiency by 55.4%, increasing the average daily output by 59.6%, and saving 52% of pit props. 90% of the gently inclined working faces that should be promoted throughout the bureau have adopted this new coal mining method. The promotion of new mining methods has promoted technical innovations in transportation and raw material utilization.

This year, the Jingxi Mining Bureau encountered two ideological obstacles in promoting the technical innovation experiences of its own and brother coal mines: One was that a few cadres and technicians did not correctly understand new things, seizing on individual imperfections in the innovative experiences to doubt the value of advanced experiences; the other was that a few workers were influenced by habitual forces, feeling that the advanced experiences were "unwieldy" and "uncomfortable" because they were not yet familiar with their laws. The Party Committee of the Mining Bureau analyzed this situation and decided to take the promotion of innovative experiences as the central link in the current technical innovation and technical revolution. Party committees at all levels immediately strengthened ideological and organizational leadership among cadres and workers, organizing the vast number of employees to launch a high tide of theoretical study. Many cadres studied articles on how Marxists-Leninists view new things, criticized their own erroneous understandings, corrected their attitudes towards new things, and actively participated in the promotion of new technologies. Under the education and encouragement of the Party organization, the workers also increased their enthusiasm for adopting new technologies. When the 5th Coal Extraction Team promoted the "three-free working face," they initially lacked experience, and one working face experienced rock blockage during coal extraction. At that time, a few workers believed that the new coal mining method was not as "smooth" and "stable" as the old coal mining method, worrying that the failure to promote it well would affect the completion of production tasks. The Party organization immediately led them to examine the reasons for the initial failure of promotion, making the workers realize that mastering a new coal mining method also requires adapting to local conditions and requires persistent efforts. As a result, the workers mustered greater enthusiasm, insisted on continuing the experiment, and quickly became familiar with the new coal mining method. After the promotion, production was greatly increased.

    革新后立即推广　推广中又不断革新
    京西煤矿狠抓先进经验　生产持续上升
    新华社6日讯　京西矿务局在技术革新和技术革命运动中，大力推广先进经验，革新成功后立即推广，推广过程中又不断革新的局面，使生产水平节节上升。今年头五个月，这个矿全面超额完成了产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率和坑木消耗等五大指标。5月份和1月份相比，原煤平均日产量增长10．5％，劳动生产率提高28％，原煤成本降低20．9％，坑木消耗降低45．9％。
    今年以来，这个局在回采、掘进、运输和节约原料材料等方面，都实现了大量的革新。全局职工在党委领导下，随时互通情报，互相取经献宝，形成了一种学习为荣、助人为乐的共产主义新风尚。大台矿的职工听到龙泉雾石灰石矿创造新的岩石钻探方法成功，马上派人学习，连夜推广，真是一夜春风百花开，次日早晨全矿所有风锤都使用了这项新技术，使岩石钻探效率提高一倍。王平村矿创造了一种吊车器后，知道安家滩矿极需这种设备，就迅速赶制一台送去。房山矿革新井下电车线试验成功，各矿立即派一百多名机电工人前来支援，仅用四个小时就把三千九百多米的改线工程全部完成，这支推广队在一周内又将其他五个矿的电车线进行改革，节约铜线八千五百七十米。
    采煤方法的大革命，是煤炭增产的中心环节，在两个月的时间内，这个局的急倾斜和缓倾斜两种煤层都推广了新的采煤法。木城涧矿创造无人、无坑木、无电溜子的“三无工作面”采煤法成功，使过去采煤的十三道工序减少到三道工序，采煤效率提高一倍半，成本降低三分之二，人员减少55％。全局应推广的急倾斜工作面，已有80％推广了这种新采煤法。城子矿职工在缓倾斜煤层试验成功“采煤与掘进合一”的采煤法，提高采煤效率55．4％，平均日产量增加59．6％，节约坑木52％。全局应推广的缓倾斜工作面，已有90％推广了这种新采煤法。新采掘方法的推广，推动了运输、原料材料利用等方面的技术革新。
    今年，京西矿务局在推广本局和兄弟煤矿的技术革新经验中，曾经遇到两种思想障碍：一种是少数干部和技术人员对新生事物的认识不正确，抓住革新经验中尚不完善的个别地方，怀疑先进经验的价值；一种是少数工人受着习惯势力的影响，因为一时还不熟悉先进经验的规律，感到使用起来“不顺手”、“不得劲”。矿务局党委分析了这种情况，决定把推广革新经验作为当前技术革新和技术革命的中心环节。各级党委立即在干部和工人中加强了思想领导和组织领导，组织广大职工掀起了一个学习理论的高潮。许多干部学习了马列主义者如何看待新生事物的文章，批判了自己的错误认识，端正了对待新生事物的态度，积极地参加新技术的推广工作。工人们在党组织的教育和鼓励下，也提高了采用新技术的积极性。回采五组推行“三无工作面”时，开始由于缺乏经验，有一个工作面在采煤时发生了岩石阻塞出煤的现象，当时有少数工人认为新采煤法还不如老采煤法“顺手”、“稳当”，耽心推广不好影响生产任务的完成。党组织立即领导他们检查了初次推广失利的原因，使工人认识到掌握一种新采煤法也需要因地制宜，需要经过顽强的努力。于是工人们鼓足更大干劲，坚持继续试验，结果很快就熟悉了这种新采煤法，推广后大大提高了生产。
