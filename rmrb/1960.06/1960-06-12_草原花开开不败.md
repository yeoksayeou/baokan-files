    Prairie flowers bloom, never fading,
    The flower-filled wilderness, so lush.
    Yurts are beautiful, so beautiful,
    Chubby children flourish alongside the flowers!
    The population of herdsmen thrives, thrives,
    The Party's kindness is higher than the sky.
    Prairie flowers bloom, never fading,
    The flower-filled wilderness, so lush.
    Chairman Mao sent good doctors,
    To cure the illnesses of the aunties.
    Inside the beautiful yurts,
    Many aunties give birth to their firstborn every day.
    Prairie flowers bloom, never fading,
    The flower-filled wilderness, so lush.
    The aunties hug their babies,
    The aunties kiss their babies;
    Babies, grow up quickly and go to Beijing,
    Go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao,
    He will surely smile heartily:
    "You must build communism well."
    The aunties hug their children tightly,
    Falling asleep and waking up smiling several times,
    Prairie flowers bloom, blooming in all seasons,
    The flower-filled wilderness, forever lush.

    草原花开开不败
    内蒙古昭乌达盟阿鲁科尔沁旗  白音花人民公社  季有才草原花开哟，开不败，花的原野哟，多丰茂。蒙古包美哟，美丽哟，白胖的孩子同花并茂！牧民人口繁荣，繁荣哟，党的恩情哟，比天高。草原花开哟，开不败，花的原野哟，多丰茂。毛主席派来好大夫，医好大婶们的病。美丽蒙古包里，一天就有许多大婶生下头生子。草原花开哟，开不败，花的原野哟，多丰茂。大婶搂着宝贝，大婶吻着宝贝；宝贝快长大到北京去，快到北京去拜见毛主席，他老人家一定笑迷迷：“你们好好建设共产主义。”大婶紧紧搂着孩子，睡着了笑醒了好几回哟，草原花开哟，四季开，花的原野哟，永丰茂。
