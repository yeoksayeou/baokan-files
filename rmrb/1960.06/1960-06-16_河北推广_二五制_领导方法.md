Cadres More Deeply Lead Production, Work More Effectively, and Improve Their Political and Theoretical Level Better
The "Two-Five System" is: Two days a week for cadres to hold meetings, check work, and study; five days to go deep into production teams to participate in and lead production
This newspaper, Tianjin, June 15th. The experience of the "Two-Five System" leadership method in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, has universally blossomed and borne fruit throughout the province. The "Two-Five System" leadership method is: Two days a week for cadres from county Party committees, commune Party committees, and management district general branches to hold meetings, check work, and study; five days to go deep into production teams to participate in and lead production. (For details of Wuqiao County's experience, see page 4.) Currently, the vast majority of leading organs and directly subordinate units in all seven cities and sixty-two counties in the province have fully implemented this working method; among commune-level cadres, more than 90% have implemented this working method. In addition, in various industries such as factories, mines, transportation, commerce, and trade, new and appropriate working methods have been implemented or are being researched and formulated based on the spirit of the "Two-Five System" leadership method and the specific business conditions of each unit. The widespread implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method has had a significant effect on improving leadership style and working methods, as well as promoting current production.

The emergence of the "Two-Five System" leadership method in Wuqiao County attracted great attention from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the "Two-Five System" leadership method is a new development in the Party's mass line leadership method. Implementing this leadership method is of great significance for overcoming and preventing bureaucracy and for more deeply promoting production. The decision was made to rapidly promote it throughout the province at all levels of Party committees and was deployed at the six-level cadre meeting held in April. Party committees at all levels conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, and after detailed study and discussion of the leadership experience of the "Two-Five System," combined with the specific conditions of their localities, made resolutions, plans, and measures for its implementation. In order to quickly promote this leadership method and see immediate results, many regions have adopted methods such as sending people to Wuqiao County to "study abroad" and "learn from experience," and responsible cadres taking the lead in going deep into the grassroots to conduct pilot projects and create models, and combined the promotion of the "Two-Five System" with the "Five-Good" cadre movement, conducting monthly and quarterly evaluations. Because this leadership method was supported by the majority of cadres and the masses, it was promoted quickly and well throughout the province.

In the process of promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership method, all localities paid special attention to adapting to local conditions to make it more perfect and more suitable for local work and production needs. The "Two-Five System" is generally implemented in plain areas; mountainous areas, in response to the characteristics of vast and dispersed areas and the inconvenience of cadres going to the countryside, implemented the "Three-Seven System," that is, three days in ten days to hold meetings to study work and conduct study, and seven days to go deep into the grassroots to participate in and lead production, solving the contradiction that too much time was spent on traveling back and forth and that the time for studying work was too short. Tang County, combined with its local leadership methods and leadership experience, combined the implementation of "one contract," "one specialization," "one study," "one meeting," "three stays," and "two rotations" in the implementation of the "Two-Five System." The so-called "one contract" means that cadres contract to communes, teams, and square fields, grasping ideology, production, and life together. The so-called "one specialization" means that on the premise of doing a good job in overall work, devote oneself wholeheartedly to studying a crop or a task. The combination of "contract" and "specialization" cultivates cadres to develop towards the path of being both red and expert. The so-called "one study," "one meeting," "three stays," and "two rotations" means that all cadres going to the countryside spend one day studying, one day attending meetings, three days staying at points, and two days rotating, so that the majority of cadres can conduct in-depth investigations and research through staying at points, create experience, and summarize experience; through rotation, they can guide overall work in a timely manner, achieve guiding overall work with points, and effectively guide the comprehensive development of various tasks. These methods have all achieved very good results.

The widespread implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method has generally streamlined and merged upper-level organizations in various places, and a large number of cadres have gone deep into the masses, strengthening the leadership of grassroots work. According to statistics from Hengshui, Gaocheng, Xinle, Shulu, and Ningjin counties, more than 20,000 cadres went deep into production teams in May, an increase of 36% compared to April; according to statistics from Handan, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Chengde cities, more than 100,000 cadres have gone to the front line of production, contracting teams, contracting squares, and contracting crops; more than 30,000 cadres have gone deep into canteens to participate in management work. Under the leadership of secretaries at all levels, Xinle County has 1,207 cadres contracted to more than 300 Class III production teams in the county, reversing the backward situation of these teams in a very short time. Because the majority of cadres spend most of their time participating in production and work at the grassroots level, and everyone has mastered a large amount of material, the number of meetings, documents, and reports has been greatly reduced, and the quality has been continuously improved. According to surveys in Shijiazhuang City and thirteen counties, the number of meetings and documents after the implementation of the "Two-Five System" has been reduced by more than half compared to before the implementation; Chengde City has reduced it by two-thirds.

Because there are fewer meetings and reports, cadres have more time to go deep into work and strengthen investigations and research. After streamlining meetings and reports, Qian'an County immediately launched a "Double Ten" movement among cadres to do a good job in ten investigations and summarize ten typical experiences, which effectively promoted current work. Shulu County's vast number of cadres, due to in-depth work, quickly summarized the advanced experiences of the Yaotou Production Team in achieving high standards in drought resistance, the Shuangliushu Production Team in saving water, the Zhao Bazhuang Production Team in achieving high utilization rates of irrigation and drainage machinery, and Zhang Wenli, a young technical innovation expert, in leading the masses in the fight against drought, setting up four red flags in the county and launching a learn-from, catch-up-with, and surpass competition, pushing the county's drought resistance struggle to a new climax. The widespread implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method has also ensured the work, study, and labor time of the vast number of cadres. Many cadres not only have time to study culture and theory, but also can study technology well and become all-rounders who can lead, produce, and master technology. Therefore, they praise the "Two-Five System" saying: "The Two-Five System" is really effective, it is the most effective in improving cadres. (Attached picture)

    河北推广“二五制”领导方法
    妥善安排了参加生产、调查研究、加强领导和学习理论的关系
    干部更深入地领导生产更有成效地进行工作更好地提高政治理论水平
    “二五制”是：在一周中，两天为干部开会、检查工作和学习时间，五天为深入生产小队参加生产领导生产时间
    本报天津15日电　河北省吴桥县“二五制”领导方法的经验，已在全省各地普遍开花结果。“二五制”的领导方法是：在一周中，两天为县委、公社党委、管理区总支等干部开会、检查工作和学习时间；五天为深入到生产小队参加生产和领导生产的时间。（吴桥县的经验详见第四版）目前，全省七个市和六十二个县的绝大多数领导机关和直属单位，已经全部推广这一工作方法；在公社一级干部中，有90％以上实行了这一工作方法。另外，在厂矿、工交、财贸各行各业，也都根据“二五制”领导方法的精神和本单位的业务情况，已经实行或者正在研究制订新的适宜的工作方法。“二五制”领导方法的普遍推行，对于改进领导作风与工作方法以及推动当前的各项生产起了显著作用。
    吴桥县“二五制”领导方法的出现，引起了河北省委的极大重视，省委认为“二五制”的领导方法，是党的群众路线的领导方法的新发展，贯彻这一领导方法，对克服与防止官僚主义，更加深入地推动生产有重要意义，决定迅速地在全省各级党委普遍推广，并在4月份召开的六级干部会议上作了部署。各级党委认真贯彻了省委的指示，在详细研究讨论了“二五制”的领导经验之后，结合当地的具体情况，作出了推行的决议、计划和措施。为了使这一领导方法迅速推广、立见功效，不少地区都采取了派人到吴桥县“留学”、“取经”和负责干部带头深入基层搞试点、搞样板的方法，并把推行“二五制”和开展“五好”干部运动结合起来，按月按季进行评比。由于这种领导方法受到广大干部和群众的拥护，在全省就推广得又快又好。
    在推行“二五制”领导方法的过程中，各地特别注意了因地制宜，使其更加完善，更加适合本地工作和生产的需要。一般平原地区大都实行“二五制”；一般山区针对地区辽阔分散，干部下乡往返不便的特点，实行“三七制”，即在十天中，三天时间开会研究工作和进行学习，七天深入基层参加生产领导生产，解决了往返走路占时过多和研究工作、学习时间过少的矛盾。唐县结合当地的领导方法和领导经验，在执行“二五制”中结合推行了“一包”、“一专”、“一学”、“一会”和“三蹲”、“两转”等一整套的领导方法。所谓“一包”，就是干部包社、包队、包方田，思想、生产、生活一起抓。所谓“一专”，就是在作好全面工作的前提下，全心致志地钻研一种作物或一项工作。“包”和“专”相结合，培养干部向又红又专途径发展。所谓“一学”、“一会”和“三蹲”、“两转”，就是所有下乡干部在一周内，一天学习，一天开会，三天蹲点，两天转面，使广大干部通过蹲点，进行深入的调查研究，创造经验，总结经验；通过转面，及时指导全面工作，做到以点带面，有效地指导各项工作全面地发展。这些方法都收到了很好的效果。
    “二五制”领导方法的普遍推行，各地普遍精减、合并了上层机构，大批干部深入群众，加强了基层工作的领导。据衡水、藁城、新乐、束鹿、宁晋五个县的统计，5月份深入到生产队的干部达两万多名，较4月份增加了36％；另据邯郸、天津、唐山、承德四个市的统计，已有十余万名干部走上生产第一线，包队、包方、包作物；有三万多干部深入了食堂参加管理工作。新乐县在各级书记带动下，有一千二百零七名干部分包了全县的三百多个三类生产队，在很短时间内就扭转了这些队的落后局面。由于各级干部大部时间在基层参加生产和工作，每人都掌握了大量的材料，使会议、文件、表报的数量大为减少，质量不断提高。据石家庄市、十三个县的调查，推行“二五制”以后的会议和文件，均比推行以前减少一半多；承德市减少了三分之二。
    由于会议表报少，干部就有了更多的时间深入工作和加强调查研究。迁安县在精减会议、表报以后，在干部中马上开展了搞好十项调查和总结十项典型经验的“双十”运动，有力地推动了当前工作。束鹿县广大干部，由于工作深入，在领导群众的抗旱斗争中，很快总结了摇头生产队抗旱高标准满堂红，双柳树生产队节约用水，赵八庄生产队排灌机械利用率高和青年技术革新能手张文礼等先进经验，在全县树起了四面红旗并开展了学、赶、超竞赛，把全县的抗旱斗争推向了新高潮。“二五制”领导方法的普遍推行，还使广大干部的工作、学习和劳动时间有了保证，很多干部不仅有了学习文化、学习理论的时间，而且能很好地钻研技术，成了会领导、会生产、会技术的多面手。因此，他们歌颂“二五制”说：“二五制”真是行，提高干部它最灵。（附图片）
