Beating the Summer Heat to Seize High Yields

    The Party organization of the Fourth Brigade of the Jinan City Construction Company's Municipal Party Committee office building construction site, in view of the characteristics of open-air operations, vigorously grasped the work of heat prevention and cooling. They organized medical personnel to conduct physical examinations for more than 400 workers on the construction site. Workers suffering from high blood pressure and other conditions unsuitable for high-altitude operations were transferred to other jobs. In addition, they purchased tea, hawthorn slices, refreshing salted mint tea, etc., to ensure that workers had an adequate supply of heat-relieving beverages. For various heat prevention facilities on the construction site, they also actively made arrangements in the spirit of spending less money and accomplishing more. For example, they mobilized the masses to collect waste materials such as broken mats and old iron barrels from the construction site to build eleven open-air operation shelters. They also established on-site showers and women's hygiene rooms.

    In order to solve the impact of temperature on construction, the leaders of the construction site made reasonable arrangements in advance in the construction plan. For example, they stipulated that when the temperature at high-altitude operations reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit, construction would be stopped and workers would switch to indoor work. This not only ensured the health of the workers, but also reduced downtime.

    自己动手又好又省
    济南市建筑公司四大队市委办公大楼工地党组织，针对露天作业的特点，大抓防暑降温工作。他们组织了医务人员，对工地四百多名工人进行了体格检查，对于患有高血压等不适合高空作业的工人，都调换了工作。另外，又购买了茶叶、山楂片、清盐薄荷茶等，保证工人有充足的防暑饮料。对于施工现场的各种防暑设备，也本着少花钱、多办事的精神，积极进行安排。如发动群众收集工地上的破席、旧铁桶等废旧物料，搭设了十一个露天操作凉棚，还设立了现场淋浴室和女工卫生室等。
    为了解决气温对施工的影响，工地领导事先就从施工计划上做了合理安排，如规定在高空作业温度达到华氏一百零六度时，就停止施工，转入室内做其他工作。这样，既保证了工人健康，又减少了停工时间。
