Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th. According to the final statistics of the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," more than five million people across Japan participated in the unified action on June 18 to crush the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. People in various regions carried out vigorous anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggles through strikes, demonstrations, mass rallies, and other means. The number of people participating in the unified action in some major cities far exceeded previous events.

    In addition to 400,000 people in Tokyo holding an unprecedented large-scale demonstration, surrounding the Diet and the Kishi Nobusuke residence, causing Kishi Nobusuke to spend three or four hours in disarray on the sofa, in Osaka, from early morning to late at night, demonstrators gathered in large numbers in Otemae Park, where they held five consecutive mass rallies. A total of 150,000 people participated in the various mass rallies, including workers (including workers belonging to the right-wing All-Japan Trade Union Congress), students from various schools, and citizens from all walks of life. They held placards expressing their firm rejection of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" being "naturally passed" by the Diet.

    On that day, 10,000 students belonging to the Osaka Student Union surrounded the Osaka Police Department, shouting: "We want revenge for our friend Michiko Kamba!" "Severely punish the murderers!"

    It is worth noting that many students participated in the demonstration for the first time. Students from the conservative church school, Rika Women's University, also participated in the demonstration, holding a huge banner that read: "Mr. Eisenhower, do not exploit Japanese Christians for imperialist interests!"

    Nohara Satoru, the leader of the Socialist Party's Osaka local organization, and Kawakami Kanichi, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, spoke at the mass rally in Otemae Park. They emphasized that the so-called "natural passage" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by the Diet is completely invalid.

    The demonstration that started from the park lasted for seven and a half hours, ending at 9:30 in the evening.

    In Hiroshima, 17,000 workers, students, and cultural workers held a mass rally in Peace Park. This was an unprecedented large-scale gathering against the "Security Treaty" held in Hiroshima. Participants included dockworkers who had held a one-hour strike before the meeting, religious figures, housewives, and shop owners.

    A huge portrait of Michiko Kamba, the female student murdered by the Kishi Nobusuke government, was hung on the presidium of the rally. Fujita, a pastor from the Hiroshima Christian Peace Service Association, said facing the portrait that the people of Hiroshima have now stood up and taken strong action to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke.

    After the meeting, the participants held a large-scale demonstration, shouting slogans: "Bury the 'Security Treaty'!" "Killer Kishi Nobusuke step down!" They marched mightily towards Hiroshima Station, calling on the people to participate in the patriotic struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    In the northernmost Hokkaido, an unprecedented number of people also rose up to oppose the "Security Treaty." In more than 20 places including Sapporo, Otaru, Muroran, and Asahikawa, a total of 300,000 workers and citizens from all walks of life participated in the demonstration.

    In Sapporo, 1,000 students held a demonstration in the streets from early morning. In the afternoon, 15,000 workers, students, citizens, and university professors held a mass rally.

    When the representative of the Communist Party of Hokkaido called on the workers to prepare for a powerful general strike, the state-owned railway, telecommunications, and postal workers participating in the rally enthusiastically responded.

    The unified struggle against the "Security Treaty" held by the Japanese people on June 18 powerfully demonstrated the Japanese people's firm fighting will to never give up until the "Security Treaty" is crushed and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is overthrown.

    坚决粉碎日美军事条约　坚决打倒岸信介内阁
    日本五百万人参加“六·一八”斗争
    东京大阪示威群众严正宣布“自然成立”的日美条约根本无效
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：据日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的最后统计，在6月18日，日本各地共有五百多万人参加了粉碎新日美“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁的统一行动。各地人民以罢工、示威和举行群众大会等各种方式进行了气势磅礴的反美反岸爱国斗争。特别是在一些主要城市参加统一行动的人数远远超过了过去。
    除了东京四十万人举行规模空前的大示威、包围国会和岸信介官邸，使岸信介狼狈地在沙发上睡了三、四个钟头以外，在大阪，从一早到深夜，集中在大手前公园的示威者人山人海，在那里连续举行了五个群众大会。参加各个群众大会的共有十五万人，其中有工人（包括属于右翼的全日本工会会议的工人）、各校学生以及各阶层市民。他们拿着标语牌，表示他们坚决不接受国会“自然通过”的新日美“安全条约”。
    当天，属于大阪学生联合会的一万学生包围了大阪警察局，高呼：“我们要为我们的朋友桦美智子报仇！”“严惩杀人犯！”
    值得注意的是，有许多学生第一次参加示威。保守的教会学校李花女子大学的学生也参加了示威，她们拿着巨幅标语牌，上面写着：“艾克先生，不要为帝国主义利益利用日本基督徒！”
    社会党大阪地方组织的领导人野原觉和日共中央委员川上贯一在大手前公园的群众大会上讲话。他们强调指出，所谓国会“自然通过”新日美“安全条约”，是完全无效的。
    从公园出发的示威持续了七个半小时，到晚上九时半才结束。
    在广岛，一万七千工人、学生和文化工作者在和平公园举行了群众大会。这是在广岛召开的一次空前盛大的反对“安全条约”的集会。参加大会的还有在会前举行了一小时罢工的码头工人、宗教界人士、家庭妇女以及商店老板。
    大会主席台上挂着被岸信介政府杀害的女学生桦美智子的巨幅遗像。广岛基督教和平服务协会的牧师藤田面对着遗像说，广岛人民现在已经站起来采取强有力的行动来打倒岸信介。
    会后，与会者举行了声势浩大的示威，高呼口号：“把‘安全条约’埋葬掉！”“杀人犯岸信介下台！”他们浩浩荡荡地向广岛车站前进，号召人民参加反对“安全条约”的爱国斗争。
    在最北部的北海道，也有空前众多的群众奋起反对“安全条约”。在札幌、小樽、室兰、旭川等二十多个地方，共有三十万工人和各阶层市民参加了示威。
    在札幌，一千名学生从一早就在街上举行了示威游行。下午，一万五千工人、学生、市民以及大学教授举行了群众大会。
    当北海道的共产党代表号召工人们准备举行强有力的总罢工时，参加大会的国营铁道、电讯和邮政工人热烈地表示响应。
    日本人民在6月18日举行的反对“安全条约”统一斗争，有力地表现出日本人民不粉碎“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁绝不罢休的坚决的斗争意志。
