Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: After U.S. President's Secretary Hagerty encountered strong protests and demonstrations from the Japanese people, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama hurriedly and obsequiously telephoned U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, and Hagerty to express "condolences" and "apologies."

At a press conference held that afternoon, Fujiyama shamelessly announced that he was prepared to submit a "written condolence" to the American Embassy on the 11th.

Fujiyama described yesterday's patriotic and just actions of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism as a "very rude matter" and expressed that he "felt very sorry."

After the press conference, this Foreign Minister hurriedly gave a speech on television, saying that what happened yesterday was "the most disgraceful thing for Japan."

He once again said that he had expressed "regret" to the American Embassy and, with a standard slavish expression, triumphantly announced, "But we have not received any protests from the American Embassy."

    藤山一副奴才相
    竟赶忙向哈格蒂道歉
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎10日在美国总统秘书哈格蒂受到日本人民的强大抗议示威之后，赶紧慌慌忙忙、奴颜卑膝地打电话给美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二和哈格蒂表示“慰问”和“道歉”。
    藤山在当天下午举行的记者招待会上恬不知耻地宣布，他准备在11日向美国大使馆提出“书面慰问”。
    藤山把昨天日本人民强烈反对美帝国主义的爱国正义行动说成是“非常失礼的事情”，并且表示“感到非常遗憾”。
    这位外务相在记者招待会以后又连忙在电视广播中发表谈话，说昨天发生的事情是“日本最大的丢人的事情”。
    他又一次说，他已经向美国大使馆表示“遗憾”，并且以标准的奴才相洋洋得意地宣布，“但是还没有接到美国大使馆的任何抗议”。
