Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th June: The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee reconvened on the 7th at the Palais des Nations. The meeting was presided over by Burns, head of the Canadian delegation.

    Zorin, head of the Soviet delegation, submitted the Soviet Union's new proposals regarding the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament to the Ten-Nation Committee for discussion and elaborated on these proposals.

    Zorin said: "The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee adjourned its meeting on April 29 due to the summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to be held in Paris. The highest-level meeting did not take place. The United States undermined this meeting with its aggressive actions. Recent events show that aggressive forces continue to carry out actions that undermine peace and the security of all nations.

    In formulating the new proposals, the Soviet government considered the results of the first phase of the Ten-Nation Committee's negotiations, and also took into account the proposals, opinions, and hopes put forward by the member states of the Committee and other countries. This includes, first and foremost, the opinion put forward by France: to implement the disarmament plan by starting with the destruction of the means of delivering nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction to their targets.

    Zorin pointed out that while destroying all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets, all foreign military bases on foreign territories should be removed and foreign troops withdrawn from these countries' territories during the first stage of the complete and thorough disarmament plan. The direct link between these disarmament measures cannot be ignored. Because, as everyone knows, some countries establish military bases on foreign territories primarily to deploy tools for delivering nuclear weapons near the borders of socialist countries.

    He said that it is now clearer than ever that the purpose of foreign military bases on foreign territories is solely for aggression, and therefore their very existence is a threat to peace.

    He said: There are still many difficulties before us. We know that there are still people in the world who oppose disarmament and the easing of international tensions. These are those who are keen on the "Cold War" and advocate the arms race, and those who carry out acts of aggression.

    Eaton, head of the US delegation, spoke first at today's meeting. The US representative said that the US government is studying in detail the Soviet Union's new proposals regarding the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. However, he only spoke vaguely about the necessity of resolving the disarmament issue.

    After the Soviet representative spoke, Martino, head of the Italian delegation, spoke, saying that there are some points in the new Soviet proposals that bring the positions of both sides closer to each other.

    The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for June 8.

    十国裁军委员会复会
    佐林谴责侵略势力破坏和平
    指出在别国领土上的军事基地的用途只是为了侵略
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦7日讯：十国裁军委员会7日在国联大厦复会。会议由加拿大代表团团长伯恩斯主持。
    苏联代表团团长佐林把苏联关于全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的新建议提交给十国委员会讨论，并对这些建议作了论证。
    佐林说：“十国裁军委员会由于拟定在巴黎举行的苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府首脑会议而在4月29日中断了会议。最高级会晤没有举行成。美国以自己的侵略行动破坏了这次会晤。最近的事件表明，侵略势力继续进行破坏和平和各国人民安全的行动。
    苏联政府在拟定新建议时考虑了十国委员会谈判第一阶段工作的结果，并且考虑了委员会成员国以及其他国家提出的建议、意见和希望。这里首先包括法国提出的意见：从销毁把核武器以及其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器运送至目标的手段开始实现裁军计划。
    佐林指出，在销毁运送核武器至目标的一切手段的同时，在全面彻底裁军计划的第一阶段应该撤除在别国领土上的一切外国军事基地，并从这些国家的领土上撤退外国军队。不能不考虑裁军方面的这些措施之间的直接联系。因为，大家知道，某些国家在别国领土上建立军事基地首先是为了在社会主义国家国境附近配置运送核武器的工具。
    他说，现在比任何时候都明显，在别国领土上的外国军事基地的用途只是为了侵略，因此它们存在的本身就是对和平的威胁。
    他说：在我们面前还有不少的困难。我们知道，世界上还有反对裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的人。这就是那些热中于“冷战”和鼓吹军备竞赛的人，这就是那些进行侵略行动的人。
    美国代表团团长伊顿在今天的会议上首先发言。美国代表说，美国政府正在详细地研究苏联的关于全面彻底裁军条约的基本条款的新建议。但是，他只泛泛地谈到解决裁军问题的必要性。
    在苏联代表发言后，意大利代表团团长马提诺发言，他说，苏联新建议中有一些使双方立场取得某些接近的论点。
    委员会下次会议定在6月8日举行。
