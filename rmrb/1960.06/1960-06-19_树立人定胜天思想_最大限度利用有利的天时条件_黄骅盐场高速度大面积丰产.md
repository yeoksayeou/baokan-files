Establishing the Idea that Man Can Conquer Nature and Maximizing the Use of Favorable Weather Conditions
Huanghua Salt Field Achieves High-Speed, Large-Scale, and High-Yield Production

(Our dispatch) The workers of the Changlu Huanghua Salt Field in Hebei Province, battling in the golden season, have launched a magnificent salt-winning campaign. As of June 5th, the output of crude salt has completed 72% of the annual plan.

The Huanghua Salt Field is a newly established unit with a poor foundation, insufficient power equipment, and weak technical strength. Therefore, it failed to complete the state plan last year. However, since the peak season this year, the salt field has leaped from the bottom of the province to the top. Their main experience in achieving this result is to adhere to putting politics in command, establishing a firm belief that man can conquer nature, actively recognizing and mastering the laws of weather changes, and maximizing the use of favorable weather conditions. As early as before the start of sun-drying this year, in order to obtain high-concentration seawater and prepare raw materials for salt production, the field formed an army of thousands of people, resolutely fighting against the severe cold in the biting winter, implementing ice-breaking to collect tides, and demanding water from the sea. At the same time, they vigorously compacted the evaporation ponds, reducing the seepage loss of brine. After entering the peak season, due to insufficient water-lifting power, the water source supply became tense. The field leaders again firmly grasped the key of tide collection. Led by the field director, they concentrated the leadership and technical strength of functional departments such as repair and maintenance, brine production, production, and capital construction, working hard day and night to increase the water-lifting capacity. In order to rush to build temporary water-lifting stations, the field director and workers worked hard together, laboring and commanding at the same time. At the same time, they conscientiously implemented the principle of combining power water-lifting with natural tide collection, and adopted measures such as unified management of water sources, overcoming the difficulties and supplying the needs of brine production.

In terms of brine production and crystallization management, they earnestly promoted advanced experiences such as deep-water brine production, deep-brine crystallization, and appropriate long-term crystallization through on-site meetings, organized visits, and demonstrations, and frequently carried out inspections. Therefore, they maximized the use of favorable weather conditions and greatly improved equipment utilization. For example, the crystallization area of the Third Branch in April was similar to the same period last year, but the output increased by 49.05% compared to last year.

Leading cadres going deep into the front line of production and firmly grasping measures is also an important guarantee for the leap in output of this field. After the prelude to the peak season salt-winning campaign was unveiled, the field moved the production headquarters to the site, and the secretary, field director, engineers, etc., all personally went to the front line to direct operations. At the same time, a large number of cadres were also transferred to production teams to eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, helping with work and solving problems. Each branch field reported and inspected once a day. When problems were discovered, specific measures were immediately taken, and actions were taken immediately, achieving unified command, consistent action, and implementation of measures. Therefore, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of workers was greatly encouraged, and the continuous leap forward in production was effectively guaranteed.

    树立人定胜天思想　最大限度利用有利的天时条件
    黄骅盐场高速度大面积丰产
    本报讯　河北省长芦黄骅盐场职工，大战黄金季节，掀起了波澜壮阔的夺盐大战，到6月5日止，原盐产量已完成了全年计划的72％。
    黄骅盐场是一个新建单位，基础较差，动力设备不足，技术力量薄弱，因此去年没有完成国家计划。可是，今年旺季以来，这个盐场由去年占全省末位一跃而为首位。他们取得这样成绩的主要经验，是坚持政治挂帅，树立坚定的人定胜天的思想，积极地认识和掌握天时变化的规律，最大限度地利用有利的天时。早在今年开晒以前，这个场为了夺取高浓度的海水，准备制盐原料，就组成了千人大军，在寒风刺骨的冬天，同严寒坚决搏斗，实行凿冰纳潮，向大海要水。同时，大力压固蒸发池，减少了卤水的渗透损失。进入旺季以后，由于扬水动力不足，水源供应出现紧张，场领导上又紧紧抓住纳潮这一关键，以场长为首，集中了修配、制卤、生产、基建等职能部门的领导和技术力量，昼夜苦战，增加扬水能力。为了突击修建临时扬水站，场长和工人一起苦干，边劳动、边指挥。同时，认真贯彻执行了动力扬水与自然纳潮相结合的方针，采取了水源统一管理等措施，攻破了难关，供应了制卤的需要。
    在制卤和结晶管理等方面，他们通过现场会议，组织参观、表演等办法，认真推广了深水制卤、深卤结晶、适当长期结晶等先进经验，并经常进行检查，因而最大限度地利用了有利的天时条件，大大提高了设备利用率。如三分场在4月份结晶面积与去年同期相差无几，而产量却比去年增长49．05％。
    领导干部深入生产第一线，狠抓措施，也是这个场产量飞跃上升的一个重要保证。旺季夺盐大战的序幕揭开以后，这个场便把生产指挥部搬到现场，书记、场长、工程师等都亲临第一线指挥作战。同时，还抽调了大批干部深入生产小组与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，帮助工作，解决问题。各分场一天一汇报、一检查，发现问题，立即采取具体措施，马上行动，作到了指挥统一，行动一致，措施落实。因而大大鼓舞了广大职工的革命干劲，有力地保证了生产的持续跃进。
