Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 20th: An editorial in the Indian "Free Press" pointed out that "the storm in Japan" forced Eisenhower to cancel his visit to Japan, "such a bellicose president of an imperialist power ran away with his tail between his legs."

The "Free Press" editorial on June 17th said that Eisenhower "originally wanted to go to Japan to save Nobusuke Kishi, but ended up falling into the water himself."

The newspaper said that the Japanese masses had seen through Eisenhower's true face. "The Japanese people, through the catastrophe of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, recognized the barbaric and ferocious nature of American imperialism, and realized that being tied to the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' meant they were being sent to their deaths." The editorial said: "The storm in Japan will be the storm in Asia." The editorial said that the main purpose of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is "to place independent Asian countries under its iron heel," therefore, "the people of all Asian countries will today gratefully acknowledge the historic role played by the fighting Japanese people," and, "faced with this unprecedented struggle of the Japanese people, the people of Asia cannot merely be bystanders."

The editorial concluded, "We want to tell Eisenhower that no amount of sweet talk about nationalism can hide the imperialist conspiracy behind it; today, the Japanese people's struggle for liberation has driven you far away, and tomorrow, in the same way, a site will be prepared throughout Asia to bury American imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 18th: The Indonesian "Youth Daily" said that the event of Eisenhower being forced to cancel his visit to Japan once again proves that the U.S.'s aggressive foreign policy has no market. The downfall of Syngman Rhee and Menderes can also prove this. As for Nobusuke Kishi, he has no other choice but to step down to satisfy the legitimate demands of the Japanese people.

    印度“自由报”说反美风暴将从日本扩及全亚洲
    印度尼西亚“青年报”说美国侵略政策没有市场
    据新华社新德里20日电　印度“自由报”的社论指出，“日本的风暴”迫使艾森豪威尔取消访问日本之行，“像这样一个帝国主义大国的好战的总统就这样夹着尾巴逃跑了”。
      “自由报”6月17日的这篇社论说：艾森豪威尔“原来是要到日本去救岸信介的，结果使自己落下了水”。
    报纸说：日本群众识破了艾森豪威尔的真面目。“日本人民通过广岛和长崎的浩劫认识了美帝国主义的野蛮凶相，认识到被缚在美日‘安全条约’上，就是要他们去送死。”社论说：“日本的风暴，将是亚洲的风暴”。社论说，美日“安全条约”的主要目的，是“要把独立的亚洲国家置于它的铁蹄之下”，因此，“所有亚洲国家的人民，今天将以感激的心情确认战斗的日本人民所起的历史性作用”，而且，“面对着日本人民的这种史无前例的斗争，亚洲人民也不能仅仅作为旁观者”。
    社论最后说，“我们要告诉艾森豪威尔，对民族主义说些好听话，你是掩盖不了背后的帝国主义阴谋的；今天，日本人民争取解放的斗争已经把你远远赶走，明天，同样地将在整个亚洲为埋葬美帝国主义准备好场地”。
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚“青年报”说，艾森豪威尔被迫取消访日的事件再一次证明，美国的侵略外交政策是没有市场的。李承晚和曼德列斯的垮台也可以证明这一点，以岸信介来说，他除了下台来满足日本人民的正当要求以外，没有别的出路。
