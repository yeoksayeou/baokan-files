Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd Dispatch from Washington: The sixth ministerial council meeting of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, led by the United States, opened on May 31st in Washington, the U.S. capital, ten thousand miles away from the region, plotting activities to intensify arms expansion, war preparations, and the creation of tensions in the Southeast Asian region.

This aggressive bloc's meeting took place shortly after the U.S. government painstakingly sabotaged the four-power summit conference. Prior to the meeting, the United States provided some member states of this aggressive bloc, such as the Philippines and Thailand, with new military equipment like aircraft. The U.S. also announced it would send one hundred and twenty jet aircraft to the region to conduct provocative so-called "training exercises."

As preparation for the council meeting, the military advisors' conference of this aggressive bloc held three days of secret meetings in Washington starting May 25th, studying this aggressive bloc's "existing defense plans" and how to modernize these plans "with reference to the current situation," including equipping Thai and Filipino forces with U.S.-made rockets with nuclear warheads. The meeting also discussed the long-term plan for the group's "military exercises" to be held in the coming years.

Attending the council meeting were the foreign ministers (Australia's Prime Minister Menzies) of the group's eight member states, including U.S. Secretary of State Herter, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, and French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville.

U.S. Vice President Nixon delivered a speech on behalf of U.S. President Eisenhower at the opening ceremony. He expressed that the United States would seize the opportunity of its sabotaging the Paris summit conference to strengthen its control over these puppet states. He demanded that the representatives of this aggressive bloc consider "how the development of events after the U.S. sabotaged the four-power summit conference has changed the international atmosphere and the 'free world'," and what policies the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc itself should adopt to cope with the new situation. Nixon called for strengthening the various aggressive blocs cobbled together by the United States. He said, "Due to the developments in the past few weeks, the necessity of maintaining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other collective security organizations (meaning aggressive blocs) is more important than ever before. ... (The United States) solemnly reaffirms its loyalty to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and is determined to fully fulfill its obligations to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Nixon admitted that the United States not only fundamentally had no intention of negotiating disarmament, but also intended to further strengthen the policy of arms expansion and war preparations throughout the world. He said, "If one fact in international relations has become clear, it is that the weakness and concessions of free countries cannot buy peace... We should follow a very important principle in the coming years, which is firmness." He also clamored that "a firm attitude in diplomacy must be combined with military strength sufficient to deter any potential aggressor from acting."

Nixon tried his best to use his fabricated so-called "communist challenge" as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and suppress national democratic movements there. He reversed black and white, saying that the Lao civil war provoked single-handedly by the United States, and the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the fascist rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, etc., were all so-called communist "probing activities, indirect aggression and subversion." He nakedly proclaimed the purpose of this aggressive bloc's interference in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries under the banner of anti-communism, saying that the United States established the Southeast Asia group "also for the purpose of dealing with threats more insidious than open aggression."

In his speech, Nixon also revealed the United States' uneasiness about the struggle of the people in Asia and Africa against the puppet regimes that blindly followed the United States' arms expansion and war preparations. He admitted that "the proud people of Asia, Africa, and the Near East" "deeply resent" their countries being used as pawns by the United States, and that the U.S. policy of coercing these countries to expand arms and prepare for war cannot solve their problems. He pretended to say "they have a right to economic progress."

While advocating strengthening the U.S. military blocs and "position of strength," Nixon did not forget to play another deceptive trick of the United States in pursuing its aggressive policy, namely, the so-called "peace negotiations." He said that the United States must be "firm but not belligerent." Although the United States painstakingly sabotaged the four-power summit conference, he said, "But we must, and will continue to, explore every possible avenue for negotiating outstanding differences with communist countries."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter spoke at the meeting, praising the role played by the late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in the activities of assembling the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and paid "tribute" to Dulles. Herter repeatedly boasted that the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc was a "deterrent to aggression" and "a vital link" in the U.S.'s various aggressive blocs.

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also advocated a military bloc policy in his speech. He said, "Individual strength cannot replace collective strength. To maintain peace, we must be prepared to unite to deal with aggression. This is the essence of collective security." However, he could not but admit that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was not popular in the Southeast Asian region. He said, "We recognize that some countries in this region do not wish to have anything to do with our activities."

The Prime Minister of Australia and the Foreign Ministers of New Zealand, Thailand, Pakistan and other countries unanimously echoed the U.S.'s anti-China clamors in their speeches. Australian Prime Minister Menzies slandered China as "having the missionary zeal to transform the world." Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano slandered China for strengthening "subversive movements" and "military threats."

### 在破坏首脑会议后进一步制造紧张局势  美国纠集东南亚集团加紧侵略活动  尼克松鼓吹继续扩军备战和镇压东南亚民族民主运动

    在破坏首脑会议后进一步制造紧张局势
    美国纠集东南亚集团加紧侵略活动
    尼克松鼓吹继续扩军备战和镇压东南亚民族民主运动
    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：以美国为首的东南亚侵略集团部长理事会第六次会议5月31日在远离这个地区万里之外的美国首都华盛顿开幕，策划在东南亚地区加紧扩军备战和制造紧张局势的活动。
    这个侵略集团的这次会议是在美国政府处心积虑地破坏了四国政府首脑会议之后不久召开的。美国在会前向这个侵略集团的某些成员国，例如菲律宾和泰国提供了新的飞机等军备装备。美国还宣布要派遣一百二十架喷气式飞机到这个地区举行挑衅性的所谓“训练演习”。
    作为对理事会会议的准备，这个侵略集团的军事顾问会议从5月25日起在华盛顿举行了三天秘密会议，研究了这个侵略集团“现有的防务计划”和“参照目前的局势”使这些计划现代化的问题，其中包括以带原子弹头的美制火箭装备泰国和菲律宾的部队。会议还讨论了在今后几年举行的这个集团的“军事演习”的长期计划的问题。
    出席理事会会议的有这个集团的八个成员国的外交部长（澳大利亚为总理孟席斯），其中包括美国国务卿赫脱、英国外交大臣劳埃德、法国外交部长德姆维尔。
    美国副总统尼克松代表美国总统艾森豪威尔在开幕会上致词。他表示美国要利用它破坏巴黎首脑会议的机会来加强控制这些仆从国家。他要求这个侵略集团的各国代表考虑美国破坏了四国首脑会议以后的“事态发展怎样改变了国际气氛，和‘自由世界’”，特别是东南亚侵略集团本身应当采取什么政策来对付新的局势。尼克松号召加强美国拼凑的各种侵略集团。他说，“由于过去几个星期中的事态发展，保持东南亚条约组织和其他集体安全组织（意即侵略集团）的必要性比过去更加重要。……（美国）庄严地重新保证忠于东南亚条约组织，并决心充分履行它对东南亚条约组织承担的义务。”
    尼克松承认美国不但根本无意谈判裁军，而且还要进一步加强在世界各地推行扩军备战政策。他说，“如果说国际关系中的一个事实已经变得清楚的话，那就是自由国家的软弱和让步是不能买到和平的……我们应当在今后年代里遵循一个十分重要的原则，那就是坚定”。他还叫嚷“外交上的坚定态度必须同足以使任何潜在的侵略者不敢动手的军事力量相结合”。
    尼克松竭力想用他杜撰的所谓“共产主义的挑战”为借口来干涉东南亚国家的内政和镇压那里的民族民主运动。他颠倒黑白地把美国一手挑起的老挝内战和南越人民反抗吴庭艳集团法西斯统治的斗争等等，都说成是所谓共产主义的“试探性活动、间接侵略和颠复活动。”他赤裸裸地宣扬这个侵略集团在反共的幌子下干涉东南亚国家内政的目的说，美国成立东南亚集团的“目的还在于对付比公开的侵略更加阴险的威胁”。
    尼克松在演说中还表露了美国对亚、非地区的人民反抗一味追随美国扩军备战的傀儡政权的斗争感到不安。他承认，“亚洲、非洲和近东的有自豪感的人民”对他们的国家被美国当作小卒“是深恶痛绝的”，美国胁迫这些国家扩军备战的政策解决不了它们的问题。他假惺惺地说“他们有权获得经济进展”。
    尼克松在鼓吹加强美国的军事集团和“实力地位”的同时，并没有忘记玩弄美国在推行其侵略政策时的另一个欺骗手段，即所谓“和平谈判”的手段。他说什么美国必须“坚定而不好战”。尽管美国处心积虑地破坏了四国政府首脑会议，他说“但是我们必须、并且将继续探索同共产党国家就悬而未决的分歧进行谈判的每一个可能的途径。”
    美国国务卿赫脱在会上发言赞扬美国故国务卿杜勒斯在拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动中起的作用，并且向杜勒斯“致敬”。赫脱一再吹嘘东南亚侵略集团是“防止侵略的威慑力量”，是美国各种侵略集团中的“一个极重要的环节”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在发言中也鼓吹军事集团政策。他说，“单独的力量不能代替集体的力量，要维护和平就要准备联合起来对付侵略，这就是集体安全的实质”。但是，他不能不承认，东南亚条约集团在东南亚地区并不受欢迎。他说：“我们认识到，这个地区有些国家不希望同我们的活动发生什么关系。”
    澳大利亚总理和新西兰、泰国、巴基斯坦等国外交部长在发言中一致附和美国敌视中国的叫嚣。澳大利亚总理孟席斯诬蔑中国“有改造世界的传教士的热情”。菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺诬蔑中国将加强“颠复性运动”和“军事威胁”。
