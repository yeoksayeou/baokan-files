Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Tokyo: Twenty-eight organizations, including the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Committee, jointly issued a statement today opposing U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan. They have also sent representatives to deliver the statement to the U.S. Embassy.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. President's visit to Japan is intended to support the Kishida Nobusuke government, which forcibly passed the new "Security Treaty" and undermined democracy, and to exacerbate international tensions.

The statement said that Eisenhower is responsible for the presence of the infamous Black Jet (spy plane) stationed in Japan and for the tensions in the Far East. Therefore, his visit will cause great anxiety among the Japanese people.

The twenty-eight groups also issued an open letter to Eisenhower. The letter urged Eisenhower to abandon the idea of visiting Japan.

The twenty-eight groups have decided to take protest actions jointly with the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty." When U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty arrives in Japan on the 10th to prepare for Eisenhower's visit, these groups will hold a demonstration that night to oppose Eisenhower's visit.

Meanwhile, Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), told foreign reporters today that if Eisenhower does not cancel his trip to Japan, Sohyo will launch a massive protest action against him.

This newspaper's combined reports, according to Xinhua News Agency: Marshal Malinovsky, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, issued a statement on May 30 regarding striking the bases from which aggressive aircraft take off. This has caused a widespread reaction among the Japanese people, and the call for the United States to withdraw U-2 spy planes from Japan has become even louder.

The government of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, where U-2 aircraft are stationed, formally requested the Japanese government on June 1 to urge the United States to withdraw these spy planes. A spokesman for the prefectural government said: These aircraft pose a danger to Kanagawa Prefecture.

The prefectural people's conference to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and local representatives went to Tokyo on June 3, and asked Kishida Nobusuke, Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichiro, and the US Embassy to withdraw the U-2 aircraft. The representatives said: "In the future, we will include the demand to withdraw U-2 aircraft into the struggle to demand the dissolution of the Diet and the abolition of the new Security Treaty."

As of June 3, the prefecture had collected 350,000 signatures, resolutely demanding the withdrawal of US spy planes.

Takatani Shigehira, the mayor of Yamato City, Kanagawa Prefecture, visited the commander of the US Atsugi Naval Air Facility on June 2 and requested the withdrawal of U-2 aircraft.

The Kanagawa Prefectural People's Conference adopted a resolution on May 19 demanding the withdrawal of the U-2 aircraft and submitted the resolution to the prefectural authorities and the US Consulate.

The "Akahata" newspaper reported on June 1 that Malinovsky's statement was not only a heavy blow to the ruling groups in Japan and the United States, but also an encouragement to the Japanese people who are struggling to withdraw US U-2 aircraft from Japan and to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

"Akahata" condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government for refusing to accept the official Soviet note and blatantly expressing its willingness to cooperate with the United States and take provocative actions against the Soviet Union and China. "Akahata" said that if the US bases (including U-2 aircraft) are not removed from Japan, the real threat to Asian peace will not be eliminated.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an article by a columnist saying, "Since U-2 aircraft may bring serious danger to Japan at any time, the presence of these aircraft in Japan is a serious problem." The columnist also said, "We refuse to take responsibility for the United States' spying activities. We should demand that U-2 aircraft withdraw from Japan."

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the afternoon of June 1 regarding the warning issued by Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky, saying, "In order to protect peace and the security of our country, the government should make a strong demand to the United States: the United States should immediately withdraw these aircraft from Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The Hyogo Prefecture Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a standing board meeting on May 31 and decided to launch a movement against the US Seventh Fleet entering Kobe Port.

The meeting held that the entry of the US Seventh Fleet, which is equipped with nuclear weapons, into Kobe Port will endanger the lives of Kobe residents, and that the seawater will also be polluted due to the entry of US nuclear submarines into the port.

The meeting also passed a resolution demanding the resignation of the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. The resolution was sent to the Kishida Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party on June 1.

Dockworkers in Kobe are also preparing to launch a movement against the US fleet entering Kobe Port.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Tokyo: Representatives of the Japan Dockworkers' Joint Struggle Conference visited Naruse, the Speaker of the Kobe City Council, on June 3 and requested the city authorities to take immediate measures to make the warships of the US Seventh Fleet stationed in Kobe Port leave.

Oyama, the chairman of the Joint Struggle Conference, told Naruse that the warships of the Seventh Fleet are, in fact, putting pressure on the Japanese people's movement against the new Japan-US "Security Treaty."

Speaker Naruse replied that the city council, which is in session, will review this issue.

This Joint Struggle Conference is composed of the Dockworkers' Union, the Customs Workers' Union, and other port-related unions.

    反美怒火燃遍日本
    二十八个社会团体声明反对艾森豪威尔访日
    神奈川三十五万人签名要美国撤走间谍飞机
    兵库县人民将展开运动反对美舰进入神户港
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日中友好协会和日本和平委员会等二十八个团体今天联合发表声明，反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本，并且已经派代表把这份声明书送交美国大使馆。
    声明指出，美国总统这次访问日本，是为了给强行通过新“安全条约”、给破坏民主的岸信介政府撑腰；是为了加剧国际紧张局势。
    声明说，对于在日本驻扎臭名远扬的黑色喷气机（间谍飞机）和远东的紧张局势，艾森豪威尔是负有责任的。因此，他的访问将引起日本人民极大的不安。
    这二十八个团体同时还发出了给艾森豪威尔的公开信。信件要求艾森豪威尔打消访问日本的念头。
    这二十八个团体已经决定同阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议联合采取抗议行动，当美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂为了给艾森豪威尔访日进行准备而在10日到达日本时，这些团体将在10日夜里举行反对艾森豪威尔访日的示威游行。
    同时，日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章今天对外国记者说，如果艾森豪威尔不取消他的日本之行，“总评”将对他发动声势浩大的抗议行动。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联国防部部长马利诺夫斯基元帅5月30日发表的关于将打击侵略飞机起飞的基地的声明，在日本人民当中引起了广泛的反应，要求美国从日本撤走U—2型间谍飞机的呼声更加高涨。
    驻有美国U—2型飞机的日本神奈川县政府在1日正式要求日本政府促使美国撤走这种间谍飞机。县政府的发言人说：这种飞机对神奈川县是一种危险。
    这个县的阻止修改“安全条约”县民会议和当地代表五十人在3日到了东京，向岸信介、外相藤山爱一郎和美国大使馆要求撤走U—2型飞机。代表们说：“今后要把要求撤走U—2型飞机这件事情纳入要求解散国会、废除新安全条约的斗争之中。”
    到3日为止，这个县已经征集了三十五万人的签名，坚决要求撤走美国间谍飞机。
    神奈川县大和市市长高下重平在2日访问了美军厚木基地的司令官，要求撤走U—2型飞机。
    神奈川的县民会议曾在5月19日作出要求撤走U—2型飞机的决议，并把这项决议提交给县当局和美国领事馆。
    1日的“赤旗报”说，马利诺夫斯基的声明不仅是对日本和美国统治集团的沉重打击，也是对正在为使美国U—2型飞机撤出日本和为反对艾森豪威尔访问日本而斗争的日本人民的一种鼓励。
    “赤旗报”谴责岸信介政府拒不接受苏联的正式照会、公然表示要同美国合作，对苏联和中国采取挑衅行动。“赤旗报”说，如果不从日本撤除美国的基地（包括U—2型飞机），对亚洲和平的真正威胁就不会消除。
    “读卖新闻”刊登一位专栏作家的文章说，“既然U—2型飞机可能随时给日本带来严重的危险，这种飞机留驻在日本是严重的问题”。这位专栏作家还说，“我们拒绝承担美国进行间谍活动的责任。我们应当要求U—2型飞机撤出日本”。
    日本社会党1日下午就苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基提出的警告发表声明说，“为了保卫和平和我们国家的安全，政府应该向美国提出强烈要求：美国立即把这种飞机撤出日本”。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本兵库县禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会在5月31日举行常任理事会会议，决定展开运动反对美国第七舰队开进神户港。
    会议认为，拥有核武器装备的美国第七舰队开进神户港，将给神户市居民的生命造成危险，同时由于美军原子潜水艇开进港内，海水也将被污染。
    会议还通过决议，要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。这项决议书已经在1日寄给岸信介政府和自由民主党。
    神户的码头工人也在准备展开运动，反对美国舰队开进神户港。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本码头工人共同斗争会议的代表3日访问神户市议会议长成濑，要求市当局立即采取措施，使停泊在神户港的美国第七舰队的军舰离开。
    共同斗争会议主席大山对成濑说，第七舰队的军舰事实上正在对日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的运动施加压力。
    成濑议长答复说，正在开会的市议会将审议这个问题。
    这个共同斗争会议是由码头工人工会、海关职员工会和其他有关港务的工会组成的。
