Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: U.S. aggressor troops in Taiwan run amok, committing all kinds of evils, bringing profound disaster to the Taiwanese people, and arousing widespread popular opposition to U.S. imperialism. In many places in Taiwan, slogans have appeared: "Drive the American soldiers out of Taiwan!"

According to Taiwanese newspaper reports, the American bandits recently occupied the scenic area of Yangmingshan in Taipei to build a park exclusively for Americans to visit, turning the beautiful Yangmingshan area into a "restricted area where Taiwanese people cannot set foot." The news says that American soldiers in Taiwan have occupied many farmlands, fishing areas, and scenic spots over the past few years, designating them as "military restricted zones" and nailing up signs saying "No Trespassing." Taiwanese people who accidentally enter these "restricted zones" are chased and shot by the U.S. military. Yuanshan, Beitou, and Caoshan in the suburbs of Taipei, which were originally popular places for citizens to visit, are now full of residences of U.S. military "advisors," and citizens are no longer allowed to enter. The Zhongshan North Road area of Taipei City is home to many U.S. military agencies, clubs, and bars, which have become virtual American "concessions." Citizens passing by, especially women, are often insulted by American soldiers. In Taoyuan, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, Pingtung, Taipei, Hsinchu, and other places in Taiwan, the U.S. military has seized large amounts of farmland to build air force bases, causing farmers' cultivated land to shrink day by day, and the number of landless and land-poor farmers is increasing, with millions of farmers struggling on the brink of starvation.

The Taiwanese people deeply hate the heinous crimes of U.S. soldiers ravaging Taiwanese women. According to Taiwanese newspapers, in Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Pingtung, and other places, young women are kidnapped, raped, and killed by American soldiers almost every day. Women "disappearances" occur frequently, with as many as twenty cases in Taipei City in a single day. On the night of May 11th this year, a U.S. Army sergeant broke into the residence of a Taiwanese woman, Yin Biyun, in Taipei City, barbarously dragged her into a car, took her back to the U.S. military barracks, and raped her. On the afternoon of the 14th, in Kaohsiung City, more than a dozen American sailors chased and insulted a Taiwanese girl in broad daylight like mad dogs. In Keelung, Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other places, there are also frequent crimes of American beasts cruelly smashing or throwing women into the sea after raping them to destroy evidence. Taiwanese newspapers say that the licentious and beastly behavior of American soldiers has also affected many families of Chiang Kai-shek's military officers. At the Tainan Air Force Base, U.S. military Captain "Advisor" Thomson raped Zhao Beidi, the wife of Xiang Chuanye, a Chiang Kai-shek Air Force officer. Another U.S. military Major "Advisor" also seized the wife of Dong Zhijiang, a Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Lieutenant Colonel liaison officer. The former U.S. military "Advisory Group" naval team leader Bialy also raped the wife of Wen Keren, the former Chiang Kai-shek Navy "Zhongjian" ship captain. Taiwanese newspapers also revealed that the American invaders have now established "maid clubs" in all military bases and U.S. military residential areas in Taiwan. In Kaohsiung City alone, there are more than 400 Taiwanese women in a "maid club" exclusively for American soldiers to ravage. Many women have been driven mad by the American devils, and some insulted women have committed suicide out of shame and anger.

U.S. military vehicles do not obey traffic rules, rushing around and injuring people, which is even more sinful. According to the "Independence Evening Post" and other Taiwanese newspapers, traffic accidents in Taiwan are alarming. In April alone, there were more than 200 accidents, killing and injuring more than 300 people. The areas with the most traffic accidents are Taipei and Kaohsiung, where the most U.S. troops are stationed, and most of the vehicles causing the accidents are U.S. military vehicles with "military" and "guest" license plates. The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group's vehicles had three accidents in ten days, killing and injuring four people. Chen Xinde, a 73-year-old man in Taipei City, was killed by a car driven by American soldier Jackson. On May 15th, Cai Zhenyu, a businessman in Taipei City, was seriously injured by a "flying car" driven by American soldier Bolinger while walking on the road in broad daylight. According to Taiwanese newspapers, American soldiers are inhumane, and their crimes of driving and killing Taiwanese compatriots have reached an extremely rampant level. On Zhongshan North Road in Taipei City, a U.S. military vehicle once knocked down a Chinese woman named Wang Shuang, ran over her body, and drove away. Another U.S. military vehicle inhumanely ran over the deceased's body, crushing her into mincemeat. In addition, an American soldier named Martinez, driving a jeep, first knocked down Zhao Weiqun, the director of the political department of a Chiang Kai-shek Air Force unit near the Central Fountain Pond in Chiayi. Not only did he not stop, but he also successively killed Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Staff Sergeant Jiang Rubin and injured Li Guoji, a twelve-year-old boy, and Guo Luohan, a tricycle worker. Many Taiwanese people died tragically under the "flying cars" of the U.S. military, and even Ma Xiaojun, a "legislator" of the Kuomintang, became a victim of the U.S. military vehicle.

U.S. troops in Taiwan also recklessly conduct military exercises, frequently injuring people. According to Taiwanese newspaper reports, on May 29th, Chen Denghui and three other farmers from Chiayi County were seriously burned by incendiary bombs dropped by the U.S. Air Force. The eldest son of Luo Zhaoqian, a resident of Wenhua Street, Yonghe Town, was also shot and injured by a U.S. military bullet on May 11th. The news says that U.S. troops wantonly killing and setting fires in Taiwan is commonplace. Over the past few years, the cases of American soldiers shooting and killing Chiang Kai-shek Major Liu Ziran, beating Chiang Kai-shek Major Zhang Youde, and U.S. military "advisor" Thomson burning the maid Chen Hua to death with gasoline are only part of the crimes of American murderers in Taiwan. The news says that there have been more than a thousand incidents of U.S. troops killing Chinese compatriots in Taiwan.

Taiwanese newspapers reveal that the Taiwanese people, who have suffered from the bullying and persecution of American soldiers, harbor incomparable hatred, and anti-American sentiment is rising. Now, American soldiers are forced to avoid walking in remote places, fearing revenge from the angry Taiwanese people. In Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other places, incidents of the masses surrounding, scolding, and beating the murderous American soldiers are constantly occurring.

    侵台美军无恶不作罪行累累
    台湾人民反美情绪高涨
    新华社17日讯　美国侵略军在台湾横行霸道，无恶不作，给台湾人民带来深重灾难，激起广大人民反对美帝国主义，在台湾许多地方出现了“把美国大兵从台湾赶出去！”的标语。
    据台湾报纸消息，美国强盗最近又在霸占台北阳明山的风景区辟建公园，专供美国人游览，使风景幽美的阳明山地区成为台湾人民“不能插足的禁区”。消息说，美国兵在台湾几年来已经霸占了许多农田、渔区和风景地带，划作“军事禁区”，钉上了“禁止通行”的牌子，台湾人民误入这些“禁区”时，便遭到美军的追逐和射杀。台北市近郊的圆山、北投、草山等地，本来是市民们常去游览的地方，现在却到处是美军“顾问”的住宅，市民再也不得入内。台北市中山北路一带，设立着许多美军的机关、俱乐部、酒吧间等，俨然成了美国“租界”，路过这里的市民、特别是妇女，经常遭到美国兵的侮辱。在台湾的桃园、台中、嘉义、台南、屏东、台北、新竹等地，美军强占大量的农田修建空军基地，使农民的耕地一天天缩小，无地少地的农民日益增多，千千万万农民挣扎在饥饿线上。
    美国兵蹂躏台湾妇女的滔天罪行，台湾人民莫不深恶痛绝。据台湾报纸说，在台北、基隆、高雄、台南、屏东等地，几乎每天都有青年妇女遭受美国兵绑架、奸污和杀害，妇女“失踪”事件屡次发生，在台北市一天中竟有二十起之多。今年5月11日夜晚，一个美军上士在台北市闯进台湾妇女殷碧云的住宅，野蛮地把她拖劫上汽车，装回美军营房强奸。14日下午，在高雄市有十多个美国水兵，像疯狗一样地在光天化日下追逐和污辱一位台湾少女。在基隆、台北、高雄等地，还常常发生美国兽兵凶残地把强奸后的妇女砸死或投入海中，以灭绝罪证的罪行。台湾报纸说，美国大兵的这种荒淫兽行，使许多蒋军军官家属也遭殃。在台南空军基地，美军上尉“顾问”汤姆生奸污了蒋军空军人员向传业的妻子赵蓓蒂。另一个美军少校“顾问”还霸占了蒋军空军中校联络官董之江的妻子。前美军“顾问团”海军组组长比亚利也把原蒋军海军“中建”号舰长温可人的妻子强奸了。台湾报纸还透露，现在，美国侵略者在台湾所有军事基地和美军住宅区，都设立了“下女俱乐部”，仅高雄市一个“下女俱乐部”就有四百多台湾妇女专供美军蹂躏。不少妇女被美国鬼子弄成疯子，有些被侮辱的妇女羞愤自杀。
    侵台美军汽车不遵守交通规则，横冲直撞，伤害人命，更是罪恶多端。据“自立晚报”等台湾报纸消息，目前台湾的车祸惊人，仅4月份就发生二百多次，死伤三百多人，汽车肇祸最多的地区，是美军最多的台北和高雄，肇祸车辆大多数是侵台美军的“军”字和“宾”字号汽车。美国军事援助顾问团的汽车，十天内就发生三起车祸，辗死撞伤四人。台北市一位七十三岁的老人陈新德，被美国兵杰逊驾驶的汽车撞死。5月15日，台北市商人蔡振玉大白天行走在马路上，也被美国兵波林吉驾驶的“飞车”撞成重伤。据台湾报纸说，美国兵惨无人道，驱车杀害台湾同胞的罪行达到十分猖狂的地步。在台北市中山北路，曾经有一辆美军军车撞倒一个名叫王双的中国妇女，车从她身上开过，扬长而去；后面的一辆美国军车居然又灭绝人性地从死者的身上开过去，把死者压成肉酱。另外，还有一个名叫马丁尼尔的美国兵，驾驶着一辆吉普车，在嘉义中央喷水池附近首先撞倒了蒋军空军一个部队的政治部主任赵唯群，他不但不停车，反而接二连三地撞死了蒋军空军上士姜儒滨，撞伤了十二岁的少年李国基和三轮车工人郭罗汗。许多台湾人民惨死在美军的“飞车”下，甚至连国民党的“立法委员”马晓军也作了美国军车下的冤魂。
    侵台美军还猖狂地举行军事演习，经常伤害人命。据台湾报纸消息，5月29日，嘉义县的农民陈登辉等四人，惨遭美国空军投掷的烧夷弹烧成重伤。永和镇文化街居民罗兆乾的长子，也在5月11日被美军子弹射伤。消息说，至于美军在台湾肆意杀人、放火，更是司空见惯的。几年来，美国兵枪杀蒋军少校刘自然，殴打蒋军少校张有德，以及美军“顾问”汤姆生用汽油烧死女佣人陈花等惨案，只不过是美国杀人凶犯在台湾的一部分罪状。消息说，美军在台湾残杀中国同胞的事件，已经达千件以上。
    台湾报纸透露，饱受美国兵欺凌和残害的台湾人民，怀着无比的仇恨，反美情绪日益高涨。现在美国兵已被迫不敢在偏僻地方行走，惧怕愤怒的台湾人民复仇。在台北、基隆和高雄等地，不断发生群众包围、怒骂和痛打行凶的美国兵的事情。
