Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Tokyo: Two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Tokyo held a large-scale demonstration towards the Diet and the U.S. Embassy today, firmly demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and opposition to the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Today, workers, students, professors, and cultural figures, who victoriously participated in the unprecedented general strike, were in high spirits. They held countless red flags and banners, and marched mightily towards the Japanese Diet Building. They sat down on the spot around the Diet and held demonstrations. The number of people participating in the demonstration rapidly increased.

By one or two o'clock in the afternoon, the demonstrating masses began to fill the areas near the Diet, holding banners and chanting slogans. Parade teams arrived one after another, stretching for several kilometers.

The main slogans chanted by the demonstrating masses and written on the banners were: "Kishi Nobusuke, step down!" "Dissolve the Diet!" "We must stop the ratification of the revised Security Treaty!" "Eisenhower, don't come to Japan!"

Currently, all roads leading to the Diet are blocked with crowds. The arriving teams are continuous and seemingly endless. The number of people participating in the demonstration far exceeded general expectations. Today's large-scale demonstration is characterized by the enthusiasm of the masses, with a large number of participants being unorganized people.

Ichiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, pointed out in his speech to the huge crowd of demonstrators gathered next to the Diet that the June 4th general strike marked a great victory for the movement against the new "Security Treaty."

Asanuma said that if the Kishi Nobusuke government refuses to listen to public opinion in the face of the magnificent wave of the Japanese people's rise against it, this will only further arouse the people's movement against Kishi Nobusuke.

Asanuma said, "The Diet Building stands before us, but parliamentary democracy is dead." He said that this is precisely why all Socialist Party Diet members resigned. Asanuma's words aroused thunderous applause from the audience.

The people surrounding the Diet also held several meetings, using union trucks equipped with loudspeakers as platforms. They then held demonstrations, passing by the U.S. Embassy and the downtown area of Tokyo.

Many of the demonstrators were workers who participated in the strike this morning. Students, actors and actresses, and office workers all participated in the demonstration. The number of cultural figures participating in today's demonstration was unprecedented. Many people participating in today's demonstration were participating in a demonstration for the first time, including department store clerks, merchants, and housewives carrying their children. Restaurant owners and fishmongers carrying banners were very noticeable.

Today's demonstration more clearly than ever shows that the spearhead of public anger is directed at U.S. imperialism. The demonstrating masses surged angrily toward the U.S. Embassy. When they tried to pass in front of the embassy, they were blocked by the police. The angered demonstrators sat down in front of the embassy to hold a protest demonstration. "U.S. troops, get out of Japan!" "We don't need Americans in Japan!" "Ike, don't come!" "Ike, don't interfere in Japan's internal affairs!" "Yankees, go home!" "Americans, get out of Asia!" These slogans resounded through the sky.

The demonstrators held a rally in front of the U.S. Embassy and passed a resolution protesting to the embassy authorities and the police commander who blocked the demonstrators from passing.

At 7:00 p.m., they marched in an orderly manner to Shinbashi Station.

Subsequently, more workers, small business owners, and merchants carried lanterns and flags to gather and demonstrate near the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Tokyo: Following the victorious general strike, mass rallies and demonstrations were launched throughout Japan in accordance with the plan of the 17th National Unified Action, opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

In Tokyo, 200,000 workers, students, citizens, and people from all walks of life demonstrated in front of the Diet Square and the U.S. Embassy this afternoon, shouting slogans such as Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and Opposition to the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty.

A large number of workers, students, and people from all walks of life in the Kansai region also held rallies and demonstrations to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demanding the resignation of Kishi Nobusuke and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

In Osaka, 85,000 people participated in a grand rally held in Ogimachi Park. Conspicuous at the meeting place were mothers carrying children and about 3,000 shop owners. These shop owners had closed their businesses to participate in the meeting. In addition, 1,300 junior high school students and their teachers walked out of the classroom to participate in the meeting.

Diet member Tokuji Kameda of the Japan Socialist Party and Senator Goro Sudo of the Communist Party both participated in the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution expressing determination to fight to the end to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The meeting also passed telegrams to the people of Beijing and Shanghai, which were to thank these Chinese cities for writing letters to the people of Osaka encouraging their struggle. The telegrams expressed the determination of the people of Osaka to fight against U.S. imperialism together with the Chinese people.

After the meeting, the participants marched in three routes in Osaka City.

In Kyoto, about 15,000 people held a mass rally in Maruyama Park from the afternoon, and then held a demonstration in the city.

Prior to this, 3,000 students from Kyoto University, Doshisha University, Ritsumeikan University, and the University of Science and Art held mass rallies in their respective schools with their professors. Then they gathered in the city to hold a rally against the new "Security Treaty."

The citizens of Kobe, who are opposing the U.S. Seventh Fleet docking in Kobe Port, held mass rallies in three locations today. The 27,000 citizens who participated in the rallies passed a resolution condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for concluding the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demanding the immediate dissolution of the House of Representatives.

    反对日美军事条约的斗争怒潮汹涌澎湃
    东京二十万人大示威
    大阪京都神户群众举行盛大集会
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：东京各界二十万人今天向国会和美国大使馆举行大示威，坚决要求岸信介内阁下台，解散国会，反对批准日美军事同盟条约。
    今天，胜利地参加了史无前例的总罢工的工人和学生、教授、文化界人士斗志昂扬，他们高举着无数的红旗和标语牌，浩浩荡荡地涌向日本国会大厦。他们在国会周围就地坐下，举行示威。参加示威的人数迅速地增多。
    到下午一、二点钟的时候，示威群众开始挤满了国会附近的地方，他们拿着标语牌，并且高呼口号。一队接着一队涌来的游行队伍长达数公里。
    示威群众高呼的口号和写在标语牌上的主要口号是：“岸信介下台！”“解散国会！”“我们一定要阻止批准经过修改的安全条约！”“艾森豪威尔不要到日本来！”
    目前各处通往国会的道路已经水泄不通，挤满了群众。正在到达的队伍连绵不断，似乎没有尽头。参加示威的人数远远超过一般的预料。今天的大示威的特点是群众的积极性，大量的参加者是没有组织的群众。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎向聚集在国会旁边的人山人海的示威群众发表讲演时指出，六·四总罢工标志着反对新“安全条约”的运动获得了巨大的胜利。
    浅沼说，如果岸信介政府在日本人民奋起反对它的波澜壮阔的浪潮面前，拒不倾听舆论，这将只能更加激起人民反对岸信介的运动。
    浅沼说，“在我们面前屹立着国会大厦，但是议会民主已经死亡。”他说，正是因为如此，社会党国会议员才全体辞职。浅沼的这几句话，引起了听众的雷动的掌声。
    包围国会的人们同时举行了几个大会，他们把工会装着扩音器的卡车当作讲台。他们接着举行示威游行，经过美国大使馆和东京闹市区。
    在示威群众中有许多是参加今天上午罢工的工人。学生、男女演员、职员都参加了示威行列。参加今天示威的文化界人士的人数之多是历次游行中从来没有的。在示威群众中有许多人是第一次参加示威的，其中包括百货公司的售货员、商人和背着孩子的家庭妇女。拿着标语牌游行的饭馆老板和鱼商很引人注目。
    今天的示威比以往任何时候更加清楚地表明，公众愤怒的矛头是指向美帝国主义的。示威群众激愤地涌向美国大使馆。在他们试图通过大使馆前面的时候，他们遭到了警察的阻挡。被激怒了的示威群众在大使馆门前坐下举行抗议示威。“美国军队滚出日本！”“我们不需要美国人在日本！”“艾克不要来！”“艾克，不要干涉日本内政！”“美国佬滚回去！”“美国人滚出亚洲！”这些口号声震天动地。
    示威群众在美国大使馆前面举行大会，并通过了一项决议，对大使馆当局和阻挠示威群众通过的警察指挥官表示抗议。
    在晚间七时，他们向新桥车站进行秩序井然的游行。
    随后，又有工人、小企业者以及商人携带着灯笼和旗帜到国会附近集会和示威。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地在胜利举行总罢工之后，按照第十七次全国统一行动的计划，紧接着展开了声势浩大的集会和示威游行，反对日美军事同盟条约。
    在东京，二十万工人、学生、市民和各界人士今天下午在国会广场和美国大使馆前面示威，高呼打倒岸信介内阁和反对日美军事同盟条约等口号。
    关西地区的大批工人、学生和各阶层人民也举行了集会和示威，反对批准新“安全条约”，要求岸信介下台和立即解散国会。
    大阪有八万五千人参加了在扇町公园举行的盛大集会。在会场中令人注目的是有带着孩子的母亲和大约三千名商店店主。这些店主是停止了营业来参加大会的。另外还有一千三百名中学生同他们的教师一起走出教室来参加大会。
    日本社会党众议员龟田得治和共产党参议员须藤五郎都参加了大会。大会通过决议，表示决心为阻止批准新“安全条约”而奋斗到底。
    大会还通过了致北京市和上海市人民的电报，这些电报是为了答谢这些中国城市写给大阪人民的鼓励他们斗争的信件。电报表示大阪人民决心和中国人民一道同美帝国主义进行斗争。
    参加大会的人会后分三路在大阪市内举行示威游行。
    在京都，约一万五千人从下午起在圆山公园举行群众大会，会后在市内举行了示威游行。
    在这以前，京都大学、同志社大学、立命馆大学以及科学和艺术大学的三千名学生，同教授们一起在各自的学校内举行群众大会。然后他们在城里汇合起来举行了反对新“安全条约”的大会。
    正在反对美国第七舰队在神户港停泊的神户市市民，今天分三处举行群众大会，参加大会的二万七千市民在会上通过决议，谴责岸信介政府缔结日美军事同盟条约，并要求立即解散众议院。
