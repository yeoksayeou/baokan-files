    The First Hurdle

    The battle to conquer Mount Everest continues.

    Among the towering mountains north of Mount Everest, stands a mountain with a sharp, snowy peak, the twin sister of Mount Everest—the 7,538-meter-high North Peak of Mount Everest. Between the North Peak and the main peak lies a continuous and steep ice and snow precipice. Because it sits below the two peaks, it looks like a col, which people call the "North Col."

    The top of the North Col reaches a height of 7,007 meters above sea level, with an average slope of about 50 or 60 degrees, like a towering city wall standing on the waist of Mount Everest. To climb the summit of Mount Everest along the East Rongbuk Glacier, you must pass through the North Col. Therefore, mountaineers say that the North Col is the "gate" of Mount Everest. On the steep slopes of the North Col, there are deep and immeasurable eternal ice and snow, lurking with countless traces of ice avalanches and snow avalanches, making it the most dangerous ice and snow avalanche area in the Mount Everest range. Huge ice avalanches and snow avalanches occur almost every year, and thousands of tons of ice and rock and snow blocks spew down like a volcanic eruption, and its rumble can be heard dozens of miles away. Twenty or thirty years ago, the British "expeditions" that attempted to climb the summit from the north slope of Mount Everest were repeatedly attacked by ice and snow in the North Col. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, in one avalanche in 1922 alone, seven members of the British "expedition" were buried in the bottom of the ice and snow. Regarding the North Col, these foreign "explorers" later described in their memoirs: "The slope here is extremely steep, the snow is extremely deep, and there are deep cracks, making movement difficult. In particular, the frequent massive snow avalanches are a fatal threat to the expedition team, and it is an extremely difficult obstacle to climbing Mount Everest from the north."

    According to the overall plan for conquering Mount Everest, the task of the second acclimatization march of the Chinese mountaineering team was to open up the "gate" of Mount Everest, the North Col, and reach an area more than 7,000 meters above sea level.

    "Scouts" are dispatched

    In order to save time and open up a safe route to the North Col for the main force as soon as possible, after completing the first acclimatization march, the mountaineering team, led by Deputy Captain Xu Jing, consisting of a reconnaissance team of six of the most outstanding mountaineers, set off for the North Col on March 28, just as the main force was returning to the base camp from the third camp at an altitude of 6,400 meters, braving the wind and snow.

    On this day, the Mount Everest area was filled with roaring wind and snow, thick fog filled the sky above the North Col, and gusts of whirlwind rolled over, with snow pillars several feet high swirling on the ice slopes.

    The mountaineers of the reconnaissance team, holding ice axes in their hands and wearing sharp, high-quality steel crampons on their feet, connected with nylon ropes, one following the other, climbed the ice slope of the North Col. In this boundless white expanse of ice and snow, finding a safe marching route, free from dangerous ice caves and the possibility of ice avalanches and snow avalanches, is the most difficult task in mountaineering and exploration activities. The members of the reconnaissance team relied on their keen eyes to find safe routes through layers of dangers and difficulties; they relied on the ice axes in their hands to dig out a path forward from the ice and snow. In every second of their reconnaissance, in every step they took forward, unexpected dangers were hidden. A slip of the foot would send them rolling down the almost vertical ice wall all the way to the bottom of the rock dozens of feet deep; a slight carelessness could cause them to fall into an ice crevasse that was impossible to see the bottom of; a violent high-altitude whirlwind could blow them away without a trace; and an icefall could bury them. However, in order to open the road to victory for their comrades, the members of the reconnaissance team fought tenaciously with the fierce nature without flinching.

    The raging wind and snow covered the sky and the earth, the biting cold made the reconnaissance team members numb all over, the strong wind and snow made their eyes tear non-stop, the thin air made their heads ache and pant, the steep ice walls made them fall again and again..., but they did not lose heart, helped each other, encouraged each other, and insisted on advancing towards the top of the North Col.

    Emerging from the ice "abyss"

    Seven or eight hours passed, and the reconnaissance team members climbed to a place 6,800 meters above sea level. Now, a vertical ice crevasse blocked their path. This crevasse was deep and narrow, with a slope of more than 70 degrees, and the team members jokingly called it "Mount Everest Ice Hutong." Only by climbing up from the bottom of the vertical "Ice Hutong" could they reach the top of the North Col. After a short rest leaning against the ice surface, the reconnaissance team members immediately began to charge towards the top of the "Ice Hutong."

    Athletes Xu Jing, Liu Dayi, and Peng Shuli walked in front to clear the way. They boldly used a complex climbing technique combining ice and snow operations and rock operations, leaning against one side of the "Ice Hutong" with their backs, and stepping on the other side of the "Ice Hutong" with their feet, moving upwards inch by inch. In less than a few minutes, they felt exhausted, and sweat kept dripping from their foreheads. Athlete Liu Dayi happened to have a cold that day and was physically weak. He fell from the middle three times in a row while climbing this "Ice Hutong," causing him to feel dizzy and sore all over. But he was not discouraged and continued to climb for the fourth time, finally reaching the upper end of the "Ice Hutong."

    It was getting dark when the reconnaissance team reached the top of the North Col. They had been fighting continuously against the severe cold and ice and snow for more than ten hours, and finally found a safe route for the main force to carry out the second acclimatization march, opening the "gate" of Mount Everest.

    Due to the terrain of the North Col itself, although the route found by the reconnaissance team absolutely avoided the danger of ice avalanches and snow avalanches, the slope along the way was very steep, and there were many ice crevasses, which would inevitably bring many difficulties to the mountaineers. Therefore, shortly after the reconnaissance team concluded its reconnaissance activities, in accordance with the decision of the mountaineering team headquarters, Deputy Captain Xu Jing led another road repair team straight to the North Col to repair the road to ensure the smooth passage of the main force.

    This road repair team dug out flat steps on the steep ice surface; pulled up reliable protection ropes, and built "bridges" over wide ice crevasses; and hung lightweight metal hanging ladders on the vertical ice walls and snow walls, making this "hurdle"—the ice wall of the North Col—a safe and smooth road.

    红旗杆上了珠穆朗玛峰

    第一道难关
    征服珠穆朗玛峰的战斗在继续着。
    珠穆朗玛峰北面的崇山峻岭间，矗立着一座顶端尖突、白雪迷蒙的山峦，这是珠穆朗玛峰的孪生姊妹——拔海七千五百三十八米的珠穆朗玛峰北峰。在北峰与主峰之间，是绵延起伏的奇陡的冰雪峭壁。因为它座落在两峰之下，看上去却像一个坳谷，人们把它叫做“北坳”。
    北坳顶部拔海高达七千零七米，坡度平均在五、六十度左右，像一座高耸的城墙屹立在珠穆朗玛峰的腰部。沿东绒布冰川地带攀登珠穆朗玛顶峰，必须通过北坳，因此，登山队员们说北坳是珠穆朗玛峰的“大门”。在北坳险陡的坡壁上，堆积着深不可测的万年冰雪，潜伏着无数冰崩和雪崩的槽印，成为珠穆朗玛山中最危险的冰崩和雪崩地区，几乎每年都要发生巨大的冰崩和雪崩，千百吨冰岩和雪块像火山爆发一样喷泻而下，几十里地以外都可以听到它的轰隆声。二、三十年前，试图从珠穆朗玛峰北坡攀登顶峰的英国“探险队”，曾多次在北坳受到冰雪的袭击。根据大英百科全书的记载，仅1922年一次雪崩中，就有七名英国“探险队”的工作人员被埋到冰雪的底层。关于北坳，这些外国“探险家”们在后来的回忆录中曾描写说：“此地坡度极大，积雪极深，有深陷的裂缝，行动艰难，特别是经常发生的巨大块状雪崩，对探险队更是致命的威胁，是从北面攀登珠穆朗玛峰的极大的难关。”
    根据征服珠穆朗玛峰的总体计划，中国登山队第二次适应性行军的任务，就是要打通北坳这座珠穆朗玛的“大门”，到达拔海七千米以上的地带。
    “侦察员”出动了
    为了争取时间，尽快地为大队开辟一条通向北坳的安全路线，登山队在完成了第一次适应性行军任务以后，于3月28日，正当大队从拔海六千四百米的第三号营地返回大本营的同时，副队长许竞带领了一个由六名最优秀的登山运动员组成的侦察小组，冒着风雪向北坳进发了。
    这天，珠穆朗玛山区风雪咆哮，北坳上空浓雾弥漫，阵阵旋风滚过，冰坡上翻卷起几丈高的雪柱。
    侦察小组的登山运动员们，手里拿着冰镐，脚上绑着锐利的优质钢制冰爪，用尼龙绳连结成一条线，一个跟着一个，登上北坳的冰坡。在这一望无边的白茫茫的冰雪里，寻找出安全的行军路线，既不能有危险的冰洞，又不致于发生冰崩和雪崩，在登山探险活动中，再没有比这更艰难的任务了。侦察小组的队员们依靠自己敏锐的双眼，透过重重艰险和困难，找到安全的路线；依靠自己手里的冰镐，从冰雪中刨出一条前进的道路。在他们进行侦察的每一秒钟，在他们前进的每一个步伐里，都隐藏着意料不到的危险。脚底一滑，他们就会沿着几乎是垂直的冰壁一直滚到几十丈深的岩底；稍一疏忽，他们就可能掉进一眼望不到底的冰裂缝中；一阵强暴的高空旋风，可能把他们卷得无影无踪；一次冰瀑，也可能把他们埋葬。但是，为了给自己的战友们打开胜利的道路，侦察小组的队员们毫不畏缩地与凶恶的大自然展开了顽强的搏斗。
    狂暴的风雪遮天盖地，刺骨的寒冷使侦察队员们全身麻木，强劲的风雪打得他们双眼不停地流泪，稀薄的空气使他们头疼气喘，挺峭的冰壁使他们一次又一次地摔倒……，但他们毫不灰心，彼此帮助，彼此鼓励，坚持着向北坳顶端挺进。
    钻出冰的“深渊”
    七、八个小时过去了，侦察队员们上升到拔海六千八百米的地方。现在，一道纵直的冰裂缝拦阻在他们面前。这道裂缝深陷而狭窄，坡度在七十度以上，队员们开玩笑地把它叫作“珠穆朗玛冰胡同”。只有从竖着的“冰胡同”的底部攀援上去，才能到达北坳顶端。侦察队员们斜靠在冰面上进行了短暂的休息以后，立即开始向“冰胡同”顶端冲击。
    运动健将许竞、刘大义和彭淑力走在前面开路。他们大胆地使用了冰雪作业和岩石作业相结合的复杂的攀登技术，背靠着“冰胡同”的一边，双脚蹬在“冰胡同”的另一边，一寸一寸地向上移动。不到几分钟，他们就感到疲累不堪，汗水从额角上不停地淌下。运动健将刘大义这天刚好感冒，体力比较虚弱，在攀登这个“冰胡同”时连续三次从中途跌落下来，跌得他头昏眼花，满身疼痛。但他毫不气馁，继续进行第四次攀登，终于攀到“冰胡同”的上端。
    天快黑时，这个侦察小组才到达北坳的顶端。他们连续与严寒和冰雪战斗了十多个小时，终于为大队进行第二次适应性行军找到了一条安全的路线，打开了珠穆朗玛峰的“大门”。
    由于北坳本身地形的关系，侦察小组找到的这条路线，虽然绝对避免了冰崩和雪崩的危险，但是沿途坡度很大，冰裂缝也较多，势必还会给登山队员们带来不少困难。因此，在侦察小组结束侦察活动以后不久，遵照登山队队部的决定，副队长许竞又率领了一支修路队伍直上北坳，对道路进行整修，以保证大队顺利通过。
    这支修路队伍在坡度陡峻的冰面上，刨出一级级平平的台阶；拉起牢靠的保护绳索，在宽阔的冰裂缝上搭起了“桥梁”；在垂直的冰墙雪壁上挂起轻便的金属挂梯，使这座“难关”——北坳的冰壁上，出现了一条安全而畅通的大路。　（一续）
