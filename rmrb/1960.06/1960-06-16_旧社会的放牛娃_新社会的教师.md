	Before liberation, I herded cattle for the landlord and never attended school for a single day. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, I was emancipated politically and economically, and transformed from an illiterate cowherd into a teacher in an amateur middle school class.

	I started attending winter school in 1950 and became literate in 1954. I was then selected by the masses to be a literacy teacher. Under the leadership of the Party, after six years of effort, I eliminated illiteracy among 120 people, raising the non-illiterate rate in the whole team to 97.5%, of whom 33 had entered amateur middle school and 87 had gone to amateur primary school, popularizing amateur primary education. Over the years, 27 people have been promoted from among the students to serve as production team leaders, civil teachers, accountants, and other cadres, playing a significant role in developing production.

	When I started teaching in the people's school, my low level of education often led to mispronunciations in class, which caused jokes and affected the students' learning enthusiasm. Therefore, the Party branch assigned an elementary school teacher to help me with my professional skills. I also bought elementary school textbooks myself, insisted on two hours of self-study every day, and regularly practiced writing diaries and compositions. I studied late into the night, and when I was tired, I would use cold water to stimulate myself and continue studying. In my studies, I recorded unfamiliar words and phrases, asking anyone I met, learning from everyone I encountered. If it rained, I would run to the elementary school six miles away from home to study, asking the elementary school teacher to explain grammar to me and correct my homework. In this way, after six years of self-study, I completed the language courses of higher primary school and junior high school; I learned how to use a dictionary, operate an abacus, and write articles.

	After the communization in 1958, the number of households in the brigade increased, and the number of spare-time schools increased. In order to improve the level of teaching, I contacted the teachers of various spare-time schools to form a teaching and research group, which held teaching and research activities once a week without interruption. In terms of methods, we adopted the method of "individual lesson preparation, collective research, and circulating demonstration," and initially proposed the teaching focus for various types of classes, and explored some teaching methods. For example, after literacy, in order to consolidate and improve the effect of literacy, I launched students to engage in writing new words and creation activities, and adopted methods such as reading, writing, and "moving house" (repeated practice), reading competitions, and applied writing practice meetings to consolidate learning results and improve students' writing enthusiasm.

	In order to combine teaching with production, the Party branch allocated one mu of production land to the people's school. At the same time, we also established pesticide factories, indigenous fertilizer factories, silkworm farms, and pig farms in the people's school, and opened agricultural technology courses. We adopted the method of "classroom culture, field experiments, collective research" to closely integrate production, teaching, and scientific research, and directly serve production. At present, our school raises seven pigs, produces 12,500 catties of pesticides, 9,966 catties of indigenous fertilizer, and raises eight silkworms.

	To ensure that students learn well, it is not only necessary for teachers to do a good job in teaching, but also to solve the difficulties students encounter in their studies. When some students were absent from class, I would adopt the method of "visiting, inquiring, and talking" to encourage them to enroll. When the spare-time school lacked desks and chairs, I would work with the students to move stones and build desks with wooden boards; when the students did not have textbooks, I would use my own money to buy books for them; when some students did not have clothes to wear in winter, I would take off my own cotton-padded clothes to give to the students. During daytime production, in order to enable students to learn more knowledge, I would bring a blackboard and produce with the students, using breaks to teach. Sometimes the production was not centralized, so I would carry the blackboard around for mobile teaching, teaching whatever was needed. The commune members said, "The sky is the school, the land is the classroom. Practical teaching materials are better than anything else." When it rained, I would teach from house to house to facilitate students' learning.

	Over the past six years, under the leadership of the Party, my teaching work has continuously improved, but it is still far from the requirements of the Party. In the future, I am willing to learn better, work better, and make greater achievements under the leadership of the Party.

    旧社会的放牛娃  新社会的教师
    陕西安康流水公社周家湾生产队业余中学教师  周普尧
    解放前我给地主放牛，没有上过一天学。解放后在党的领导下，我在政治、经济上翻了身，而且由一字不识的放牛娃变成了业余中学班的教师。
    我从1950年开始上冬学，到1954年脱了盲，被群众选为扫盲教师。在党的领导下经过整整六年的努力，扫除了一百二十个文盲，使全队非文盲上升到97．5％，其中已有三十三人进入业余中学学习，八十七人上了业余初等学校，普及了业余初等教育。几年来，由学员中提拔担任生产队长、民师、会计等干部的二十七人，对发展生产起了很大作用。
    开始教民校时，由于文化低常在课堂上讲错字，闹笑话，影响学员学习情绪。因此，党支部就指定初小教师从业务上帮助我，我自己也买来了小学课本，每天坚持两小时的自修，并经常练习写日记、作文，晚上学习到深夜，疲乏了，我就用冷水来刺激，继续学习。在学习中发现生字难词我就记下来，逢人就问，遇人便学。若遇下雨天，我就跑到离家六里远的初小去学习，请初小教师给我讲语法，批改作业，就这样，经过六年的自学，自修完了高小、初中的语文；学会了查字典、打算盘、写文章。
    1958年公社化后，大队户数扩大，业校处数增多，为了提高教学业务水平，我就联系各业校的教师成立了教研组，每周举行一次教研活动，从未间断。在方法上，我们采取了“个人备课、集体研究、巡回示范”的办法，初步提出了各类班级的教学重点，并摸索出一些教学方法。如扫盲以后，为了巩固和提高识字效果，我便发动学员大搞练写生字和创作活动，采取了一读、二写、三搬家，朗读比赛、应用文实习会等办法，巩固了学习成果，提高了学员的写作情绪。
    为使教学与生产相结合，党支部给民校拨了一亩生产园地，同时我们又在民校办了农药厂，土化肥厂，养蚕厂，毛猪厂，并开设了农业技术课，我们采取“课堂文化、田间搞试验，集体研究”的办法，使生产、教学、科学研究紧密结合起来，又直接为生产服务。目前我校共养猪七头，制农药一万二千五百斤，土化肥九千九百六十六斤，养蚕八张。
    要使学员学好，不光教师要作好教学工作，而且要解决学员学习中的困难问题。当有的学员缺课时，我就采取一访二问三谈的办法动员他们入学，业校没有桌凳，我就和学员一起，搬石头架木板做桌子；学员没有课本，我就拿自己的钱给学员买书；有的学员冬天没有衣服穿，我就把自己的棉衣脱下来给学员穿。白天生产时，为了使学员学习更多的知识，就带着黑板和学员一起生产，利用休息时间教课，有时大家生产不集中，我就背着黑板巡回教学，做啥教啥，社员说：“天大的学校，地大的课堂。实际的教材，比啥都强。”到下雨天就挨户教学，可以便利学员的学习。
    六年来，在党的领导下，使我的教学工作不断得到提高，但和党的要求相比还差得很远，今后我愿在党的领导下，更好地学习，更好地工作，做出更大的成绩。
