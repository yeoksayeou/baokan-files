Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 26th: According to the latest issue of the Indian weekly "New Age," workers and peasants in Kerala, India, are organizing mass marches and strikes to demand land reform and the right to work throughout the state.

The report stated that a main contingent of thirty people, led by A.K. Gopalan, president of the All India Kisan Sabha (All India Peasants' Association), will begin a twenty-seven-day, four-hundred-mile march on June 28th, culminating in a rally at Trivandrum, the seat of the Kerala state government, on July 24th.

The report indicated that smaller groups are already active in various districts and townships of Kerala. They are explaining to the rural population the danger of the land relations law, drafted by the former state government led by the Communist Party of India, being amended, mobilizing farmers to participate widely in the march to Trivandrum, and raising funds for the march. The newspaper stated that such smaller groups will be active throughout Kerala.

The newspaper pointed out that the Kerala land relations law is the only law passed in India that has the following characteristics: it stipulates the limit of land ownership, protects farmers' leased land from being taken back, etc. However, this bill has not been approved by the President and has now been returned to the Kerala Legislative Assembly for amendment.

Earlier, farmers in Kerala collected 800,000 signatures on a petition demanding that the Indian President immediately approve the land relations law and implement it.

The report also mentioned that twenty-one workers working in a British-run textile factory in the Kannanore area have marched three hundred and thirty miles to Trivandrum on June 22nd to demand the reopening of the factory, which has been closed since April 26th.

The report stated that the Secretary-General of the Kerala Farmers' Association expressed full support for the actions taken by the textile factory workers, considering this struggle as part of the fight against unemployment.

According to a report in the "Hindustan Times" on June 23rd, the Kerala Lacquer Processing Industry Union, which has 75,000 workers, has decided to call for an industry-wide strike starting on June 27th to protest against employers' refusal to increase wages and threats to close factories. The Kerala lacquer processing industry is a major industry for India in obtaining US dollars.

    新华社新德里26日电　据最近一期的印度“新世纪”周报报道，印度喀拉拉邦的工人和农民为了要求在邦内各地进行土地改革和获得工作的权利，正在组织群众性的游行和罢工。
    消息说，由全印农民协会主席高普兰率领的一支三十人组成的主要队伍将在6月28日开始进行为期二十七天、行程四百英里的游行，最后将在7月24日到达喀拉拉邦政府所在地特里凡得琅。
    消息说，目前，喀拉拉邦各区乡已有一些小队伍在进行活动。他们正在向农村的人们说明由印度共产党领导的前邦政府所制订的土地关系法有遭到修改的危险，动员农民普遍参加前往特里凡得琅的游行，并且为游行队伍筹集经费。这家报纸说，整个喀拉拉邦各地都将有这种小队伍进行活动。
    这家报纸指出，喀拉拉邦的土地关系法是在印度通过的唯一的具有以下特点的法案：规定拥有土地的限额，保护农民所租的土地不被收回，等等。但是这项法案没有得到总统的批准，它现在被退回到喀拉拉邦立法会议以便修改。
    早些时候，喀拉拉邦的农民在请愿书上征集到八十万人的签名，要求印度总统立即批准土地关系法并实行这项法案。
    消息还说，在坎南诺尔地区英国人经营的一家纺织厂中工作的二十一名工人为了要求自4月26日起就已关闭的这家工厂开工，已经游行了三百三十英里，在6月22日到达特里凡得琅。
    消息说，喀拉拉邦农民协会秘书长表示完全支持这家纺织厂工人所采取的行动，认为这种斗争是反对失业的斗争的一部分。
    据“印度斯坦时报”23日报道，拥有七万五千名工人的喀拉拉邦漆树加工工业的工会已经决定号召从6月27日起举行全行业的罢工，来反对雇主的拒绝增加工资和声称要关闭工厂的行动。喀拉拉邦漆树加工工业，是印度获取美元的主要工业。
