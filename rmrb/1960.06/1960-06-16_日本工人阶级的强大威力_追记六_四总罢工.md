    The Powerful Strength of the Japanese Working Class
    ——In Memory of the June 4th General Strike
    Lan Hai

    June 4, 1960, this day has become a glorious memorial day for the Japanese working class and the Japanese people. On this day, the Japanese working class held a nationwide general strike to force the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, to force Kishi Nobusuke to dissolve the Diet, to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to oppose the visit of the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, to Japan. Around this general strike, the Japanese people launched a powerful unified action against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The June 4th general strike achieved a great victory. It further inspired and promoted the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle, and wrote a glorious page in the history of the Japanese labor movement.

    This was the largest strike in Japan since World War II, and its mass participation was unprecedented. The number of people participating in the struggle reached 5.6 million, including 3.6 million members of 57 industrial unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and 1 million members of 19 industrial unions affiliated with the Federation of Independent Unions. Originally, Sohyo estimated that the number of participants could reach 4 million, but it greatly exceeded this estimate.

    Another important feature of the June 4th general strike is that it was a purely political strike with very clear goals and slogans. Thirteen years ago, on February 1, 1947, the Japanese working class held a political general strike to overthrow the reactionary Yoshida cabinet. This general strike was bloodily suppressed by the "uncrowned emperor" of the Japanese people at that time, the Supreme Commander of the U.S. occupation forces, MacArthur. For more than ten years, the Japanese reactionaries have launched one attack after another on the Japanese working class under the pretext that "political strikes are illegal." In particular, the workers of public corporations such as the National Railway Corporation, the Telecommunications and Telephone Corporation, and the Monopoly Corporation, as well as the employees of central and local governments, have been deprived of the right to strike by a series of fascist decrees such as the "Public Corporation Labor Relations Law," the "National Public Service Law," and the "Local Public Service Law." Even in the struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" that began in October 1958, workers from the National Railway Corporation and the Locomotive Union only held on-site rallies as a de facto strike. However, the situation of the June 4th general strike was completely different. This was a head-on political general strike launched by the Japanese working class against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries since 1947. Japanese workers completely disregarded these fascist suppression decrees and launched a heroic struggle. The National Railway Workers' Union with 350,000 members, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union with 220,000 members, the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union with more than 170,000 members, the Locomotive Union with more than 50,000 members, the National Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union, and the National Public Service Workers' Union all participated in the general strike. Undoubtedly, this was a great demonstration by the Japanese working class against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and a great review of the strength of the Japanese working class.

    In the struggle of the June 4th general strike, what most encouraged the working class and strengthened their confidence in the struggle was the unprecedentedly broad participation of people from all walks of life in the unified action to support the general strike. It can be seen that a patriotic united front, with the working class as the core and including people from a wide range of social strata, has been formed in Japan against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    In Tokyo, unified action centered on the railway workers' strike was launched. On the eve of the general strike, large-scale mass rallies were held centering on 45 major stations. After the rallies, the masses of people from all walks of life continued to stay at the stations, guarding the strike of the National Railway workers all night. A large number of National Railway workers from neighboring prefectures rushed to protect the train crew members and prevent the railway police carrying pistols from taking them away. Those who stayed up all night guarding the stations included not only members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Japan and party organizations in Tokyo and various regions, but also members of the Diet of the Socialist Party, activists and trade union members of the Socialist Party headquarters and the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of Branches, as well as university professors, writers, actors, shop owners, and housewives from a wide range of social strata. The famous film scriptwriter Zenzo Matsuyama, the poet Sumako Fukao, the professor of Tokyo Metropolitan University Shohei Shiota, and the writer Ayako Miyake and others stood with the workers and encouraged the National Railway workers. This situation is unprecedented in the history of the labor movement.

    The struggle began, and the songs of the "National Independence Action Team" resounded in every corner of Tokyo. From 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., all trams and trains in Tokyo were completely shut down. At Shinagawa Station, the southern gateway to Tokyo's railway hub, in front of the "Echo" train, which the National Railway Corporation boasted as a "super express train," large banners reading "Down with the Kishi Cabinet" and "Dissolve the Diet" were posted. About 4,000 workers and 2,000 students, as well as more than 100 actors and painters, organized a picket line at Shinagawa Station from the evening of June 3 to protect the railway workers in completing their strike mission. About 1,000 students entered the station and temporarily occupied the platform. Tokyo Station, known as the gateway to Japan, was also completely controlled by more than 1,300 workers and students who came to support the strike. When Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Japan, spoke, calling on workers to continue to launch struggles to prevent Eisenhower from visiting Japan, the workers and students applauded warmly, expressing their firm will.

    Very few people came to take the train during the strike. Ordinary citizens expressed their support for the workers' general strike in this way. Those citizens who went to the station to take the train to work not only did not have any dissatisfaction, but also, based on the suggestions of the people who had been guarding the station all night, held passenger meetings at various stations and made decisions to demonstrate at the Diet.

    On this day, shop owners in Tokyo belonging to the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association also went on strike and rushed to the Diet to participate in the demonstration. Throughout the country, tens of thousands of stores went on strike. On that day, 130,000 people demonstrated in front of the Diet. The demonstration marched from the Diet all the way to Kishi Nobusuke's official residence and the front of the U.S. Embassy, issuing roars that shocked the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    The nationwide unified action on June 4, centered on the general strike, fully demonstrated the Japanese working class's strict organization, their unprecedentedly heightened awareness, and the continuous strengthening of the unity between the Japanese working class and the masses of the people. On the basis of the victory of the June 4th general strike, the Japanese working class and the Japanese people have decided to make persistent efforts and hold a larger-scale general strike to strive for the final victory in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In the face of the great power of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, Kishi Nobusuke, who blindly follows the United States and betrays the interests of the Japanese nation, is nearing the end of his rope!

    日本工人阶级的强大威力
    ——追记六·四总罢工
    蓝海
    1960年6月4日，这个日子已经成为日本工人阶级和日本人民的光荣的纪念日。这一天，日本工人阶级为了迫使卖国求荣的岸信介政府下台、迫使岸信介解散国会、废除新日美“安全条约”和反对美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔访问日本，举行了全国总罢工。围绕着这次总罢工，日本人民展开了反对日美军事同盟条约的强有力的统一行动。六·四总罢工获得了巨大的胜利，它进一步鼓舞和推动了日本人民的爱国正义斗争，在日本工人运动史上写下了辉煌的一页。
    这是第二次世界大战后日本最大规模的一次罢工，其群众性的广泛是前所未有的。参加斗争的人数达到五百六十万，其中包括日本工会总评议会系统的五十七个产业工会的会员三百六十万人、中立工会联合会的十九个产业工会的会员一百万人。本来据“总评”的预计，参加人数可以达到四百万人，而现在大大地超过了这个预计。
    六·四总罢工的另一个重要的特点是，这次罢工是目标和口号非常明确的纯粹的政治性罢工。十三年以前，即1947年2月1日，日本工人阶级曾经为了打倒反动的吉田内阁举行过一次政治性的总罢工。这次总罢工被日本人民当时的“无冕皇帝”、美国占领军总司令麦克阿瑟所血腥镇压了。十多年来，日本反动派以“政治罢工是违法的”为借口，对日本工人阶级发动了一次又一次的进攻。特别是国营铁道公司、电讯电话公司、专卖公司等公共企业的工人和中央、地方政府职工一样，被所谓“公共企业劳动关系法”、“国家公务员法”和“地方公务员法”等一系列法西斯法令剥夺了罢工权利。就是在1958年10月开始的日本人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中，像国营铁道公司的工人和机车工会工人，只是以举行现场大会的方式进行了实际上的罢工。但是，六·四总罢工的情况就完全不同了。这是日本工人阶级自从1947年以来，向美日反动派展开的一次针锋相对的政治性总罢工斗争。日本工人完全不顾这些法西斯镇压法令而展开了英勇的斗争。拥有三十五万会员的国营铁道工会、二十二万会员的全递信从业员工会、十七万多会员的全国电气通信工会、五万多会员的机车工会、全国专卖公司工会，以及国家公务员工会等，都参加了总罢工。无疑地，这是日本工人阶级向美日反动派的一次大示威，是日本工人阶级力量的一次伟大的检阅。
    在六·四总罢工的斗争中，最鼓舞工人阶级并加强他们的斗争信心的是，空前广泛的各阶层人民参加了支援总罢工的统一行动。可以看到，在日本已经形成了一条以工人阶级为核心的包括广泛阶层人民的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国统一战线。
    在东京，以铁道工人罢工为中心的统一行动展开了。总罢工前夕，以四十五个主要车站为中心，举行了大规模群众集会。参加集会的各阶层群众在会后继续守在车站上，通宵保卫了国营铁道工人的罢工。邻近各县的大批国营铁道工人都赶来保卫列车乘务员，防止携带手枪的铁道警察把他们架走。通宵守卫在车站上的，不仅有共产党中央委员会以及东京都和各地区党组织的人员，社会党国会议员、社会党总部和东京都支部联合会的积极分子和工会会员，而且还有大学教授、文学家、演员、商店老板和家庭主妇等广泛阶层的人民。著名的电影剧本作家松山善三、诗人深尾须磨子、东京都立大学教授盐田庄兵卫、作家三宅艳子等人和工人们站在一起，鼓舞了国营铁道工人。这种情景，在工人运动史上是空前未有的。
    斗争开始了，“民族独立行动队”的歌声响彻在东京的各个角落。从清晨四时至七时，东京的电车和火车都全部停驶了。在东京铁路枢纽的南大门品川车站，在被国营铁道公司夸耀为“超特快列车”的“回声号”的前面，贴着“打倒岸内阁”、“解散国会”的大幅标语。约四千名工人和两千名学生以及一百多名演员、画家从6月3日晚上起在品川车站组织了纠察线，保卫铁路工人完成罢工任务。约一千名学生开进车站暂时占领了月台。被称为日本大门的东京车站，也完全由前来支援罢工的工人、学生一千三百多人控制。当日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄讲话，呼吁工人继续展开斗争，以阻止艾森豪威尔访日的时候，工人和学生热烈鼓掌，表示了他们坚决的意志。
    几乎很少有什么人在罢工的时候来乘车，一般市民就是以这样的行动表示支持工人总罢工的。那些为了上班到车站搭车的市民们，他们不但没有什么不满，而且还根据通宵守卫在车站的人们的建议，在各个车站举行了乘客大会，作出决定到国会去示威。
    这一天，东京都属于东京商工团体联合会的商店主们也一律罢市，并且赶到国会去参加示威。在全国，有数万家商店举行了罢市。当天有十三万人到国会前示威。示威的队伍从国会一直走到岸信介的官邸和美国大使馆门前，发出了震撼美日反动派的吼声。
    以总罢工为中心的6月4日的全国统一行动，完全证明了日本工人阶级的严密的组织性、他们的觉悟的空前提高，以及日本工人阶级和人民大众之间的团结的不断加强。日本工人阶级和日本人民已经在六·四总罢工胜利的基础上决定再接再厉，举行更大规模的总罢工，以争取反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的最后胜利。在日本工人阶级和日本人民的巨大威力面前，一味追随美国、出卖日本民族利益的岸信介已经临近穷途末路了！（附图片）
