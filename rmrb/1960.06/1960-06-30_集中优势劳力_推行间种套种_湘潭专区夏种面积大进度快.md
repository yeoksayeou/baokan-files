    Concentrating Superior Labor Force, Promoting Intercropping and Relay Cropping
    Xiangtan Special District Achieves Large Summer Planting Area with Rapid Progress

    (Our Dispatch) Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, is actively expanding its summer planting area. The district plans to plant five million mu in summer, and so far, 4.7 million mu have been sown.

    The first contradiction encountered by Xiangtan Special District in expanding the summer sowing area was the lack of land. According to the original expanded planting plan, there was still a shortage of one million mu. The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee led the people of the district to actively expand the planting area in the following three ways: At the beginning of summer sowing, under the slogan "Not letting go of a single mu, fighting for every inch of land" put forward by the Prefectural Committee, the people of the district made full use of the "ten edges" (edges of fields, roads, houses, etc.) and eliminated five types of fields, including remote mountain and valley fields, leftover fields from construction, and fields damaged by water and sand, thus expanding the cultivated land area by more than 400,000 mu. Secondly, as soon as the early rice transplanting ended, various localities arranged for more than 100,000 laborers to rush to the mountains to reclaim wasteland. So far, 400,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, and sowing is carried out while reclaiming the land.

    Third, 390,000 mu can be expanded by utilizing the late rice seedling fields after late rice transplanting. Through the above methods, the district has expanded by more than 1.2 million mu, ensuring the needs of this year's summer expansion.

    Labor shortage was the second contradiction encountered in summer sowing in Xiangtan Special District. The district had to manage and cultivate spring-sown crops well, and also plant more and plant summer-sown crops well. Therefore, various localities first adopted methods such as highly concentrated leadership and labor to strengthen the main agricultural battle line. Since May, the labor force concentrated on the agricultural front in the district has accounted for 75% of the total labor force, of which the labor force participating in summer sowing accounts for 32%. Party committees at all levels delegated more than 39,900 cadres to go deep into the front lines of production to strengthen leadership.

    In the summer sowing movement, various localities in the district also strengthened specific leadership at all levels and established a production responsibility system. Various localities have promoted the tool reform of wasteland reclamation and sowing in one go. A total of 330,000 vehicles in the district were dispatched to transport fertilizer for summer crops, 234,000 deep plowing tools were used to prepare the soil, and 85,000 new-style farm tools such as seeders and potato planters were used for rushing to sow and transplant, so that the efficiency of wasteland reclamation and sowing was doubled.

    湘潭专区夏种面积大进度快
    本报讯　湖南湘潭专区积极扩大夏种面积。全区计划夏种五百万亩，至现在已完成夏播四百七十万亩。
    湘潭专区扩大夏播面积，首先遇到的矛盾便是土地不足。按照原订扩种计划，尚缺少一百万亩。湘潭地委领导全区群众积极从以下三个方面扩大了播种面积：在夏播开始的时候，在地委提出的“分亩不让，寸土必争”的口号下，全区人民充分利用“十边”和消灭边远山冲田、基建剩余田、水冲沙压田等五类田，便扩大耕地面积四十万多亩。其次早稻插秧一结束，各地便安排十多万个劳力上山突击开荒。到现在已开出荒地四十万亩，并且一边开荒一边播种。
    第三、在晚稻栽插后，利用晚稻秧田可以扩种三十九万亩。通过以上办法全区已扩大了一百二十来万亩，保证了今年夏季扩种的需要。
    劳力紧张是湘潭专区夏播中遇到的第二个矛盾，全区既要管好、育好春播作物，又要多种、种好夏播作物，因此，各地首先采取了高度集中领导、劳力等办法，加强农业主攻战线。5月份以来全区共集中到农业战线上的劳力占总劳力的75％，其中参加夏播劳力占32％。各级党委下放干部三万九千九百多人，深入生产前线，加强领导。
    全区各地在夏播运动中，还层层加强具体领导，建立了生产责任制。各地都推行了垦荒、播种一条龙的工具改革，全区共出动三十三万部车子为夏种作物赶运肥料，二十三万四千部深耕工具整土，八万五千件播种器、插薯机等新式农具进行抢播抢插，使垦荒、播种工效都成倍提高。
