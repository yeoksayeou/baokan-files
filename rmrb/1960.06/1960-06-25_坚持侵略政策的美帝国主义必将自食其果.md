U.S. imperialism, which insists on its policy of aggression, will surely reap what it sows.
General Yang Yong

It has been exactly ten years since the American aggressors undermined peace in the Far East and the world by brazenly launching the war of aggression against Korea. In this war, the people of Korea and China, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, carried out a heroic and unyielding struggle against the most ferocious enemy of world peace, crushing the aggression, saving peace, and achieving a great victory. The American aggressors, however, lifted a stone only to drop it on their own feet, suffering a serious setback.

U.S. imperialism is a cunning imperialism. It often disguises itself, playing two-faced tricks to deceive the people of the world. After World War II, it formulated a preposterous plan to dominate the world and instigated many wars to serve the predatory policies of U.S. monopoly capital. For example, the anti-people civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek group in 1946 was actually a war in which U.S. imperialism attacked the Chinese people and attempted to turn China into an American colony. However, U.S. imperialism, which provided money, guns, and advisors to command Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people, not only attempted to hide the fact that it was the aggressor, but also disguised itself as a "friend" of the Chinese people, calling its aggression against China "friendship" towards China. This trick of the American aggressors once deceived some people. The Chinese people neither succumbed to the anti-people war waged by the Kuomintang reactionaries instigated by the United States, nor were they fooled by the U.S. peace deception. They resolutely carried out the People's Liberation War and drove U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries out of the mainland. However, U.S. imperialism was not reconciled to its defeat in mainland China. It personally launched the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to conquer the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and then invade mainland China, while also occupying China's Taiwan. This tore off the mask of the so-called "democratic country" in front of the Korean and Chinese people, and in front of the people of the world, exposing the true face of a robber, thereby giving the Korean people, the Chinese people, and even the people of the world a very good lesson. The Korean people and the Chinese people were not intimidated by the personal appearance of the United States. On the contrary, the camouflage carefully crafted by the American aggressors in the Eastern countries for a long time was completely dismantled by their own bloody atrocities, from indiscriminate bombing to germ warfare. The more ferocious the aggressors' attack on the people, the more resolute and high the people's will to fight against aggression. In Korea, after three years and one month of contest, the people of Korea and China were not eliminated or strangled. On the contrary, they stood up more strongly and crushed the American imperialist plan for a war of aggression. The United States ended its era of arbitrary violence in the East.

U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious imperialism. When it launched the war of aggression against Korea, it had a huge industrial capacity with an annual steel production of more than 80 million tons, and it had the advantage of atomic bombs. Its army had benefited in both World Wars. All of this created a myth of American "unparalleled power" at that time. This superficial appearance of American power did scare some people. U.S. imperialism itself was also intoxicated with this false phenomenon of "unparalleled power," and it was confident that destroying Korea and attacking China would be a piece of cake. However, the development of history went against the subjective wishes of the American aggressors. Less than two months after the start of the war, it was driven to a corner of Busan by the heroic Korean People's Army. When it relied on its naval and air superiority to land in Incheon and invaded northward on a large scale, it clamored that "historically speaking, the Yalu River is not a natural barrier that separates the two countries (China and Korea)," "end the Korean War before Thanksgiving," and "return home for Christmas," vainly attempting to "strangle" the new China "in the cradle." However, the people of Korea and China rose up side by side to resist, winning five battles in five campaigns, and finally drove the aggressors across the 38th parallel. Afterwards, the American aggressors launched the so-called "Summer Offensive," "Autumn Offensive," "strangulation warfare," and even "germ warfare" and a focused attack on Shangganling. But all of this was crushed one by one by the Korean and Chinese troops. The American bandits' blackmail at the negotiating table also suffered a shameful bankruptcy. On the contrary, the Korean and Chinese troops became stronger and stronger in battle. By the summer of 1953, the American aggressors could no longer advance north, and under the powerful counterattack of the Korean and Chinese troops, they could not hold their self-proclaimed strong defense line, and the battle line showed a large southward shift. In this way, the American aggressor army, which had naval and air superiority, possessed the latest aircraft and artillery, and used germ weapons, was defeated again and again by the Korean and Chinese People's Army, which was inferior in weapons and equipment. The aggressors finally paid a huge casualty toll of more than 1.09 million people and were forced to sign an armistice. This exposed the myth of "American invincibility" in front of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world, and nakedly revealed the original form of a paper tiger. U.S. imperialism gave the Korean people, the Chinese people, and even the people of the world a very good lesson: U.S. imperialism can be defeated. Although weapons are important, they are not the decisive factor in war. The decisive factor in modern war is still people, not things. In the final analysis, only the struggle of the masses of the people can determine the direction of historical development. This greatly extinguished the enemy's arrogance and boosted the people's morale. The American aggressors, by exposing their ugly face of a paper tiger on the Korean battlefield, educated and promoted the people of more and more countries to bravely launch anti-American struggles.

Imperialism always lifts a stone to drop it on its own feet when launching aggression. The class nature of imperialism determines that it will inevitably lift a stone to drop it on its own feet again and again. However, it must not be assumed that imperialism will learn a lesson, or that it will change its nature or its predatory policies because of its own failure. Imperialism is still imperialism. The war policy of U.S. imperialism has deep class and social roots and will never change. U.S. imperialism is the largest and most bellicose imperialism in the world today, and it is the mortal enemy of peace and socialism. Lenin pointed out long ago that U.S. financial capital not only makes the most money from war, but it has plundered hundreds of billions of dollars, every dollar of which is stained and covered in blood, and it strangles revolutions everywhere, playing the role of a gendarme. In the three years of the First World War from 1916 to 1918, the average annual profit of various U.S. monopoly capital groups increased by about four billion U.S. dollars compared with the three years before the war from 1912 to 1914. During the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, their net profits increased by about forty-six billion U.S. dollars compared to the net profits they obtained before the war from 1931 to 1938. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, their profits immediately soared from 27.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1949 before the war to 42.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1951. After several wars, the United States has formed a group of monopoly capitalists who specialize in relying on arms expansion and war preparation to make maximum profits. They not only dominate U.S. national policy, but also take advantage of the situation in which other capitalist countries are greatly weakened in the war to gain control over the entire capitalist world. This makes it even more greedy and more warlike. Although the United States lifted a stone to drop it on its own feet in the Korean War, exposing its hypocritical face of false peace and real aggression, and revealing its outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger form, it has neither willingly admitted defeat nor will it repent and do good. In the seven years since the Korean armistice, the United States has stubbornly obstructed the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, recklessly undermined the armistice, frantically supported the Syngman Rhee group, transported atomic and missile weapons into South Korea, continued to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, and established military bases around China and other socialist countries. It has further pieced together aggressive military blocs around the world, stepping up arms expansion and war preparation, especially the development of missile production, always dreaming that one day it can revive its military decline, provoke a new war, and achieve its wild ambition to dominate the world and enslave the people of all countries. This is exactly as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until destruction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will never violate this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say that 'imperialism is very ferocious', we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher knives, and they can never become Buddhas until their destruction." Over the past ten years, U.S. imperialism has been resolutely hostile to the people of China and Korea, hostile to the people of the world, continuing to believe in the position of strength, and continuing to carry out a series of facts of nuclear war blackmail and intimidation, most vividly confirming this brilliant conclusion of Comrade Mao Zedong.

However, since imperialism refuses to give up aggression, then no matter how it disguises itself, it will inevitably expose its aggressive nature more and more, and it cannot but promote more and more countries and people to rise up against American aggression and oppression. History is developing according to this logic. Last year, Cuba, with only six million people near the United States, overthrew the U.S.-backed dictatorial regime, ignoring U.S. threats. This year, the people of South Korea and Turkey, who are under the bayonets of the United States, successively overthrew the American-raised lackeys Syngman Rhee and Menderes. The Japanese people, who are under the heavy military occupation of the United States, launched a wave of struggles against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and overthrowing the American dog Nobusuke Kishi, forcing Eisenhower to cancel his "visit" to Japan and forcing Nobusuke Kishi to announce his resignation. Now, the anti-American storm is sweeping across every corner of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. A few days ago, the Asian people ignited a raging fire to condemn Eisenhower's bandit-like trip. All of this is proof that the aggressors are reaping what they sow. If the American aggressors continue to adhere to their policies of aggression and war, they will inevitably continue to lift a stone to drop it on their own feet, until the stones they lift bury themselves.

The just struggles of the people of all countries support each other. In the past, the Korean people's heroic resistance to the aggression of U.S. imperialism greatly supported the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. Today, the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland continues to support the struggles of the Chinese and other peoples against the American aggressors. The 650 million people of China have always regarded supporting the just struggle of the Korean people as their unshirkable internationalist obligation. We believe that with the support of the people of socialist countries and the people of all countries in the world, the heroic Korean people will eventually win the final victory. The American aggressors will eventually be driven out of Korea, and the reunification of the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea and the reunion of the thirty million people in the North and South will surely be realized.

The lifespan of the American aggressors will not be very long. Today, it is arrogantly occupying China's territory of Taiwan, refusing to withdraw its invading army from South Korea, sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, accelerating the support of Japanese militarism, and secretly exchanging the instruments of ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with Nobusuke Kishi. This is a manifestation of its desperate struggle. As long as the people of all countries are not deceived by the peace rhetoric of imperialism, are not intimidated by its nuclear war blackmail, and are not paralyzed by the peace illusions spread by modern revisionists, and resolutely take the great unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement as the core, and form the broadest united front against imperialism, we will surely be able to defeat the most ferocious enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism.

    坚持侵略政策的美帝国主义必将自食其果
    上将　杨勇
    美国侵略者破坏远东与世界和平，悍然发动侵略朝鲜的战争，已经整整十年了。在这场战争中，朝中人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界人民的支持下，和世界和平最凶恶的敌人进行了英勇不屈的斗争，粉碎了侵略，拯救了和平，取得了伟大胜利。而美国侵略者却是搬起石头砸了自己的脚，遭到了严重的挫败。
    美帝国主义是一个狡猾的帝国主义。它常常伪装，玩弄两面手法，欺骗世界人民。在二次大战以后，它早就制定了独霸世界的狂妄计划，并且早已策动了多次为美国垄断资本掠夺政策服务的战争。例如蒋介石集团在1946年发动的反人民内战，实际上就是一场美帝国主义进攻中国人民，变中国为美国殖民地的战争。但是出钱、出枪、出顾问指挥蒋介石屠杀中国人民的美帝国主义，不但企图隐瞒自己是侵略者，而且还装扮成中国人民的“朋友”，把对中国的侵略说成是对中国的“友谊”。美国侵略者的这种手法曾经欺骗了某些人，中国人民既没有屈服于美国策动的国民党反动派进行的反人民战争，也没有上美国和平欺骗的当，坚决地进行人民解放战争，把美帝国主义和国民党反动派赶出大陆。然而，美帝国主义并不甘心它在中国大陆的失败，亲自出马发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，企图征服朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并进而侵犯中国大陆，同时也霸占了中国的台湾。这就在朝、中人民面前，在世界人民面前，撕下了所谓“民主国家”的伪装，赤裸裸地暴露了强盗的本来面目，从而给朝鲜人民、中国人民以至全世界人民上了很好的一课。朝鲜人民、中国人民并没有因为美国亲自出马而被吓倒。相反，美国侵略者长时间苦心孤诣地在东方各国装扮的伪装面目，倒由于他们自己从狂轰烂炸到进行细菌战的全部血腥暴行，彻底拆穿了。侵略者对人民的进攻愈凶恶，人民反侵略斗争的意志也就愈坚决、愈高涨。在朝鲜，经过三年零一个月的较量，朝中两国人民不但没有被消灭、被扼死，相反，他们却更坚强地站了起来，粉碎了美帝国主义侵略战争计划。美国结束了在东方任意横行的时代。
    美帝国主义是一个最凶恶的帝国主义。在发动侵朝战争的时候，它有着年产钢达八千多万吨的庞大工业力量，有着原子弹的优势，它的军队在两次大战中都占了便宜。这一切，在当时便造成了一种美国“无比强大”的神话。这种美国表面强大的假象，确实吓倒了一些人。美帝国主义自己也沉醉于这种“无比强大”的虚假现象中，满以为灭朝鲜，攻中国，都是不在话下的。但是，历史的发展却走向了美国侵略者主观愿望的反面。战争开始后，不到二个月，它就被英雄的朝鲜人民军赶到釜山一隅。当它凭借海空优势在仁川登陆，大举北犯时，又曾叫嚣什么“在历史上说来，鸭绿江并不是把两国（中朝）截然分开的一道天然障碍”，“感恩节前结束朝鲜战争”，“圣诞节回国”，妄图把新中国“扼死在摇篮里”。但是，朝中人民并肩奋起抗击，五战五捷，终于将侵略者赶过了三八线。以后，美国侵略者又发动了什么“夏季攻势”、“秋季攻势”、“绞杀战”以至“细菌战”和向上甘岭的重点进攻。但这一切，又都被朝中部队一一粉碎。美国强盗在谈判桌上的讹诈，也遭到了可耻的破产。相反，朝中部队则愈战愈强，到1953年夏季，美国侵略者不但不再能向北推进，而且在朝中部队强大反击下，不能守住他自称为强固的防线，出现了战线大片南移的形势。这样，拥有海空军优势、拥有最新式飞机大炮、使用了细菌武器的美国侵略军，就一败再败，败于武器装备上处于劣势的朝中人民军队手里。侵略者终于在付出了一百零九万多人的巨大伤亡之后，被迫签字停战。这就在朝、中人民面前，在世界人民面前，被戳穿了所谓“美国不可战胜”的神话，赤裸裸地显出了纸老虎的原形。美帝国主义给朝鲜人、中国人以至全世界人民上了很好的一课：美帝国主义是可以打败的，武器虽然是重要的，但并不是战争的决定因素，现代战争中决定的因素仍然是人不是物。归根结蒂只有人民群众的斗争，才能决定历史发展的方向。这就大大灭了敌人的威风，长了人民的志气。美国侵略者就这样用自己在朝鲜战场上暴露出来的纸老虎丑态，教育了、推动了越来越多的国家的人民更勇敢地展开了反美斗争。
    帝国主义发动侵略，总是搬起石头打自己的脚。帝国主义的阶级本性，决定了它必然要再三再四地搬起石头打自己的脚，然而，绝不能认为帝国主义会接受教训，会由于自己的失败而改变了它的本性，改变了它的掠夺政策。帝国主义终究是帝国主义，美帝国主义的战争政策有着深刻的阶级根源和社会根源，是决不会改变的。美帝国主义是今天世界上最大的也是最好战的帝国主义，是和平和社会主义的死对头。列宁早就指出，美国财政资本不但依靠战争发财最多，他们掠夺了数千亿美元，每一块美元都有污迹，每一块美元都有血迹，而且到处绞杀革命，扮演宪兵的角色。在第一次世界大战的1916—1918年的三年间，美国各垄断资本集团的每年平均利润，较战前的1912—1914年的三年间，增加约四十亿美元；在第二次世界大战的1939—1945年间，他们获得的纯利润，比战前1931—1938年间获得的纯利润增加了约四百六十亿美元之多；在发动侵朝战争以后，他们的利润又立即从战前1949年的二百七十一亿美元猛增到1951年的四百二十九亿美元。经过几次战争，美国已经形成了一批专门依靠扩军备战、制造军火获取最大利润的垄断资本家，他们不仅支配美国的国家政策，并且利用其他资本主义国家在战争中大为削弱的情况，取得了对整个资本主义世界的控制地位。这就使得它更加贪得无饜，更加好战。美国在朝鲜战争中虽然是搬起石头砸了自己的脚，既暴露了假和平、真侵略的伪善面目，又现出了外强中干的纸老虎原形。但是，它既没有甘心认输，更不会改恶从善。朝鲜停战以来的七年间，美国一直顽固地阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决；放肆地破坏停战；疯狂地扶植李承晚集团；把原子、导弹武器运进了南朝鲜；继续霸占我国领土台湾，并且在我国和其他社会主义国家周围遍设军事基地；在世界各地进一步拼凑侵略性的军事集团；加紧扩军备战，特别是发展导弹生产，总梦想有朝一日可以重振军事颓势，挑起新的大战，达到其独霸世界奴役各国人民的狂妄目的。这正如毛泽东同志所早就指出过的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”十年来，美帝国主义坚决与中朝人民为敌，与世界人民为敌，继续迷信实力地位，继续进行核战争的讹诈和恫吓的一系列的事实，最生动地证实了毛泽东同志的这一英明论断。
    但是，帝国主义既然不肯放弃侵略，那末，不管它怎么伪装，就总不免要越来越多地暴露出它的侵略本质，也就不能不推动越来越多的国家和人民起来反对美国的侵略和压迫。历史正是按着这样的逻辑在发展着。去年，近在美国身边的只有六百万人口的古巴，推翻了美国扶植的独裁政权，不理会美国的威胁。今年，处在美国刺刀尖下的南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民，先后推翻了美国豢养的走狗李承晚和曼德列斯。处在美国重兵占领下的日本人民，展开了一浪高过一浪的反对日美军事同盟条约、打倒美国走狗岸信介的斗争，迫使艾森豪威尔取消了对日本的“访问”，迫使岸信介宣布下台。现在，反美大风暴正在席卷亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的各个角落。几天前，亚洲人民烧起了势如燎原的谴责“瘟神”艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的怒火，这一切正是侵略者自食其果的证明。美国侵略者继续坚持侵略和战争政策，就必然还要继续地搬起石头打自己的脚，直到它自己搬起的这些石头把它自己埋葬为止。
    各国人民的正义斗争都是互相支持的。在过去，朝鲜人民英勇抗击美帝国主义的侵略，极大地支援了中国人民和世界各国人民。在今天，朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的正义斗争，继续支持着中国和其他各国人民反对美国侵略者的斗争。中国六亿五千万人民，始终把支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争当做自己义不容辞的国际主义义务，我们相信，英勇的朝鲜人民在社会主义各国人民和世界各国人民的支持下，终将赢得最后的胜利，美国侵略者迟早是要被赶出朝鲜，朝鲜三千里锦绣江山的统一和南北三千万人民的团聚，是一定会实现的。
    美国侵略者的寿命不会很长了，它今天蛮横地霸占着我国领土台湾，拒绝从南朝鲜撤出它的侵略军，派遣间谍飞机侵略苏联，加速扶植日本军国主义，偷偷摸摸和岸信介互换日美军事同盟条约的批准书，正是它进行绝望挣扎的表现。只要各国人民不被帝国主义的和平词句所欺骗，又不被它的核战争讹诈所吓倒，也不被现代修正主义者散布的和平幻想所麻醉，坚决以社会主义阵营、国际共产主义运动的伟大团结为核心，结成反对帝国主义的最广泛的统一战线，我们就一定能够击败世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义。
