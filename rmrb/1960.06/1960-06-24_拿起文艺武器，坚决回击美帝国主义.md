    Take Up Literary and Art Weapons, Resolutely Counterattack U.S. Imperialism
    Qian Junrui
    The United States, like Germany and Japan, is a late-rising capitalist country. Before the completion of capitalist monopolies in Western Europe in the 1880s, the United States had not seized vast colonies. After 1890, it crossed the threshold of imperialism. By 1914, it had only seized 300,000 square kilometers of colonies, only one-eleventh of the colonies owned by Britain at the time, and one-thirtieth of France's. It made a fortune in the First World War. It made another fortune in the Second World War. From then on, U.S. monopoly capital became the "favored son of heaven" of the entire capitalist world, leaping to become the leader of the imperialist camp. From this, we can see that the period when U.S. capital ascended onto the world stage and "soared to prominence" coincided with the entire capitalist system entering the dying stage of imperialism, and precisely when the gravedigger of capitalism—the proletariat—was carrying out direct revolution and beginning to victoriously seize ruling power. This determined the extreme reactionary, decadent, and cruel nature of U.S. imperialism. It inevitably gathers together the epitome of imperialist greed, corruption, insidiousness, ferocity, and shamelessness.
    We, the Chinese people, have truly learned enough about U.S. imperialism's so-called "government of the people, by the people, for the people," its so-called "liberty, equality, fraternity," its so-called "American way of life," and its so-called "democratic individualism." It was precisely this U.S. imperialism that first and most cruelly oppressed our overseas Chinese workers in the Americas. It was precisely this U.S. imperialism that participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance to attack the Chinese people. It was also precisely this U.S. imperialism that put forward the Open Door policy and equal opportunity, attempting to carve up China. It was also precisely this U.S. imperialism that helped the Northern Warlords fight the revolutionary army; subsequently, it single-handedly supported Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, implementing a ten-year anti-communist civil war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it supported Chiang Kai-shek's passive resistance against Japan and active preparation for civil war. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States again provided money and guns, directed Chiang Kai-shek to provide manpower, fought for the United States, and killed Chinese people. After the Chinese people drove Chiang Kai-shek and his master out of mainland China, U.S. imperialism simply occupied our Taiwan, continued to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, undermining our country's unification; at the same time, it resolutely opposed our people, constantly infringing upon our sovereignty and carrying out war provocations. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has stirred up anti-China movements around the world, attempting to isolate our country. This time, Eisenhower went to Taiwan, vehemently attacking New China, declaring that America's determination to invade China had "not weakened in any way," and further plotted to implement "two Chinas," attempting to permanently place our territory Taiwan under U.S. occupation. The Chinese people will never forget these bloody debts owed by U.S. imperialism.
    Now, U.S. imperialism has become the mortal enemy of the people of the whole world. All modern wars of aggression, large and small, are either directly launched by U.S. imperialism or indirectly directed or supported by it. It is the most important source of modern wars of aggression. Its strategic goal is to dominate the world, preserve imperialism, and eliminate socialism and nationalism. The struggle of all the people of the world who truly love peace and fight for national independence and socialism (who constitute the vast majority of humanity) against U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle. U.S. imperialism's aggressive nature has not changed and will never change. U.S. imperialism's strategic goals have not changed and will never change. The people of the world should not harbor any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism and its representatives, whether it is Eisenhower or any of his successors, but must carry out an absolutely resolute tit-for-tat struggle with them in order to isolate and ultimately defeat U.S. imperialism to the greatest extent possible.
    The new culture of our country, led by the proletariat, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, is first of all a "revolutionary national culture," "it is opposed to imperialist oppression and advocates the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation." Thoroughly opposing imperialism is a fundamental characteristic of our revolutionary culture, and also a fundamental point of divergence from all past feudal and bourgeois cultures in China. At the same time, it is also a fine tradition of our revolutionary culture for decades. Our revolutionary culture, whether during the May Fourth Movement, the First and Second Domestic Revolutionary Wars, or during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War, the spearhead has always been directed first at imperialism, especially at the imperialism that oppressed us most fiercely at the time. This is entirely understandable. The reason we do this is determined by the requirement that the fundamental contradiction that our revolution must first resolve is the contradiction between the Chinese people and imperialism; at the same time, it is also determined by the fact that our revolutionary culture, since the May Fourth Movement, has accepted the guidance of the proletarian world outlook and is led by the Communist Party.
    After the founding of New China, the first task on our cultural front was to resolutely eliminate imperialist culture and thoroughly criticize the so-called "democratic individualism" spread by U.S. imperialism, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong; our cultural and artistic workers bravely participated in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in which they resolutely eliminated pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts. Subsequently, our cultural and artistic workers actively participated in the movement against U.S. and French imperialist aggression against Vietnam, the movement against British and French aggression against Egypt, the movement against U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, as well as the recent struggle to support the Soviet people against U.S. imperialist aggression, to support the patriotic and just struggles of the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Turkish people against U.S. imperialism, and so on. In short, our creation and construction of socialist culture is closely linked to the task of opposing imperialism. The fact is precisely this: as long as imperialism exists for one day, the spearhead of our socialist culture will always point at imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism; at the same time, our socialist culture will also grow and become stronger in the repeated struggles against imperialism and its running dogs, modern revisionism. Without struggle, there is no development. Without a resolute and thorough struggle against the main enemy of the contemporary people's cause—U.S. imperialism—our socialist cause and socialist culture cannot be developed, let alone achieve final victory.
    The most fundamental feature of the contemporary world situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind. Eisenhower's disastrous trip to the Far East once again confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant judgment to the people of the world. But the U.S. imperialists will never lay down their weapons voluntarily. On the contrary, U.S. imperialism must continue to engage in large-scale arms expansion and war preparations, use every opportunity that can be used to create tension; at the same time, continue to direct its loyal running dogs, modern revisionists, to spread illusions of "active coexistence," "class coordination," as well as bourgeois humanism and pacifism, to whitewash imperialism, undermine the people's fighting spirit, and sabotage the unity of the people of all countries. In the face of the current excellent situation, all our national cultural and artistic workers must be more vigilant, resolutely and unitedly act, take up our sharp cultural and artistic weapons, learn from the example of the artillery bombardment of the frontline troops in Fujian to greet and send off the "plague god," further thoroughly expose U.S. imperialism's conspiracy of "false peace, real war preparations; false relaxation, real aggression," and strive to isolate U.S. imperialism to the greatest extent possible in the eyes of the people of the world. At the same time, continue to thoroughly expose the traitorous faces and running dog behavior of modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique. In this way, the ideological awareness of the people of our country and the people of the world can continue to be rapidly improved, and they can be more closely united to continuously win new victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. In this way, we can truly guarantee lasting world peace.

    拿起文艺武器，坚决回击美帝国主义
    钱俊瑞
    美国和德国、日本一样，是一个后起的资本主义国家。在十九世纪八十年代西欧资本主义完成其垄断以前的发展阶段时，美国还没有抢到大片殖民地。1890年以后，它跨进了帝国主义的门槛。到1914年，它才抢得了三十万平方公里的殖民地，只有当年英国所拥有的殖民地的一百一十分之一，法国的三十分之一。到第一次世界大战，它发了一笔横财。到第二次世界大战，它又发了一笔横财。从此美国垄断资本就成了整个资本主义世界的“天之骄子”，一跃而为帝国主义阵营的盟主。由此我们可以看出，美国资本登上世界舞台，“飞黄腾达”的时期，正值整个资本主义进入垂死的帝国主义的时期，正值资本主义的掘墓人——无产阶级实行直接的革命，并且开始胜利地夺到统治权的时期。这就规定了美帝国主义的极端的反动性、腐朽性和残酷性。它必然地汇集帝国主义的贪婪、腐败、阴险、凶残和无耻之大成。
    对于美帝国主义的所谓“民治、民有、民享”，所谓“自由、平等、博爱”，所谓“美国生活方式”，所谓“民主个人主义”，我们中国人民实在是领教得够了的。正是这个美帝国主义，最早和最残酷地压迫我国在美洲的侨工。正是这个美帝国主义，它参加八国联军来攻打中国人民。也正是这个美帝国主义，它提出门户开放、利益均等，企图瓜分中国。也正是这个美帝国主义，它帮助北洋军阀打革命军；随后一手扶植蒋介石的反动统治，实行十年反共内战。在抗日战争时期，它支持蒋介石消极抗战、积极内战。在抗日战争胜利后，美国又出钱出枪，指挥蒋介石出人，替美国打仗，杀中国人。等到中国人民把蒋介石和他的主子一起赶出了中国大陆，美帝国主义就干脆侵占我台湾，继续扶植蒋介石卖国集团，破坏我国的统一；同时坚决敌视我国人民，不断侵犯我主权和进行战争挑衅。年来，美帝国主义又在世界各地煽起反华运动，妄图孤立我国。这次艾森豪威尔到了台湾，大肆攻击新中国，声明美国的侵华决心决没有“任何削弱”，并且进一步阴谋策划实行“两个中国”，妄图把我国领土台湾永远置于美国占领之下。中国人民对于美帝国主义所欠下的这些垒垒血债，是永远不会忘掉的。
    现在美帝国主义已经成为全世界人民的死敌。现代一切大大小小的侵略战争，有的是由美帝国主义直接发动，有的是由它间接指使或支持。它是现代侵略战争的最主要的根源。它的战略目的是独霸世界，保存帝国主义，消灭社会主义和民族主义。全世界一切真正爱好和平的为民族独立和社会主义而斗争的人民（他们占人类的绝大多数），同美帝国主义的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。美帝国主义的侵略本性决没有改变，也决不会改变。美帝国主义的战略目的决没有改变，也决不会改变。全世界人民对于美帝国主义及其代表，不论是艾森豪威尔也好，或是他的任何继任人也好，都不应该抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而必须和他们进行绝对坚决的针锋相对的斗争，以便最大限度地孤立并且最后战胜美帝国主义。
    由无产阶级领导的我国的新文化，正如毛泽东同志所指示的，首先是“革命的民族文化”，“它是反对帝国主义压迫，主张中华民族的尊严和独立的。”彻底地反对帝国主义，这是我国革命文化的一个根本的特点，也是和中国过去的一切封建文化和资产阶级文化的一个根本的分歧点。同时，它也是几十年来我国革命文化的优良传统。我们的革命文化，无论在五四运动时期，在第一次、第二次国内革命战争时期，也无论在抗日战争时期，以及在解放战争时期，矛头所指，首先总是指向帝国主义，特别是指向当时压迫我们最凶的帝国主义。这是完全可以理解的。我们之所以这样做，是由我国革命首先要解决的根本矛盾是中国人民与帝国主义之间的矛盾这一要求决定的；同时，也是由我国的革命文化从五四运动以后就接受了无产阶级世界观的指导，是由共产党领导这一事实所决定的。
    新中国成立后，我们文化战线上的任务首先就是遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，坚决肃清帝国主义文化，彻底批判美帝国主义所散布的所谓“民主个人主义”；我国文化艺术工作者英勇地参加了伟大的抗美援朝运动，在这个运动中，坚决肃清亲美、崇美、恐美思想。接着，我们文化艺术工作者积极参加了反对美法帝国主义侵略越南的运动、反对英法侵略埃及的运动、反对美国出兵中东的运动，以及最近支援苏联人民反对美帝侵略的斗争、支援日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民反对美帝的爱国正义斗争，等等。总之，我们创造和建设社会主义文化，是和反对帝国主义的任务密切联系在一起的。事实正是这样：只要帝国主义存在一天，我们的社会主义文化的矛头，总是要指着帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义；同时，我们的社会主义文化也就在同帝国主义及其走狗现代修正主义的反复斗争中成长和壮大起来。没有斗争，就没有发展。不同当代人民事业的主要敌人——美帝国主义进行坚决和彻底的斗争，我们的社会主义事业、社会主义文化，就不可能得到发展，更谈不到最后胜利了。
    当代世界局势的最根本的特点是东风压倒西风。艾森豪威尔远东之行的惨败，再一次向全世界人民证实了毛泽东同志的英明的论断。但是美帝国主义者决不会自动放下武器。相反的，美帝国主义一定要继续大搞其扩军备战，利用一切可以利用的机会，制造紧张局势；同时继续指使它的忠实走狗现代修正主义，散布“积极共处”、“阶级协调”，以及资产阶级人道主义、和平主义的幻想，为帝国主义擦粉，瓦解人民的斗志，破坏各国人民的团结。我们全国文化艺术工作者在目前大好形势面前，必须更加提高警惕，坚决一致地行动起来，拿起我们锐利的文化艺术武器，学习我福建前线部队万炮轰击、迎送“瘟神”的榜样，进一步彻底揭露美帝国主义“假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略”的阴谋，力求在全世界人民面前最大限度地把美帝国主义孤立起来。同时继续彻底揭穿以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义的叛徒嘴脸和走狗行为。这样，我国人民和全世界人民的思想觉悟，就能继续迅速地提高，就能更加紧密地团结起来，在同美帝国主义的斗争中不断赢得新的胜利。这样，我们就能使世界持久和平得到真正的保障。
