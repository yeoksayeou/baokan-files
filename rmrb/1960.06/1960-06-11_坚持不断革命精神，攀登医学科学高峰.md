Adhere to the Spirit of Continuous Revolution and Scale the Heights of Medical Science
Representative of Surgery Department, Guangci Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical College, Dong Fangzhong

Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the Burns Ward of Guangci Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical College has adhered to putting politics in command, maintained the spirit of continuous revolution, and implemented the policy of serving production in health work. In the treatment of burns, it has completely changed its past appearance and achieved certain successes.

Before liberation, Guangci Hospital was one of the tools used by imperialism to carry out cultural aggression against our country. The management system was extremely corrupt, and the technology was inferior. From the hospital's founding to before liberation, the vast majority of seriously burned patients died. Since the Great Leap Forward, medical personnel have broken with superstition and liberated their minds. In a short period of two years, our ward, following the successful rescue of Qiu Caikang, has treated 250 seriously burned patients, with a cure rate of 80.6%, greatly exceeding the cure rate of capitalist countries. According to literature reports from American and British capitalist countries, in the past decade, their cure rate for severely burned patients has remained at around 50%.

In the past two years, we have overcome the difficulties of having fewer personnel and gone to 40 provinces and cities across the country to conduct 61 consultation and rescue missions. At the same time, we have also launched mass movements in scientific research. With the cooperation of fraternal schools, we have completed 17 papers of a certain standard and written "Severe Burn Treatment," which has solved the key problems in the treatment of severe burns. In these two years of combat life, we have trained 67 burn specialists and 53 nurses for all parts of the country. In the general surgery teaching of the medical school, we focused on burns to teach basic surgical problems, establishing a new discipline system.

In the past two years, we have advanced along the following path.

Putting Politics in Command, Continuously Breaking Superstition,
Being Modest and Prudent, Persisting in Rescuing Patients

After the successful rescue of Qiu Caikang in 1958, the burns ward was praised as a red flag. This was the honor given to us by the Party and the masses. However, some people began to develop a sense of complacency, thinking they had reached the peak of the Great Leap Forward. At the end of 1958, while carrying out tense medical tasks, we cooperated with the filming of "Song of Life" and completed the writing of "Severe Burn Treatment." We also rescued many severely burned patients. Some comrades developed superstition about existing experience and achievements, believing that the experience was already mature, "Problems we cannot solve may be beyond others," "We have done so much, it will be difficult to leap forward further," "Rescuing patients is a constant, tense task, and it will be even more tense to engage in movements again." Since then, some people have not been so modest during consultations, and they no longer emphasized doing everything possible to rescue patients. The Party organization discovered this sense of complacency and used Chairman Mao's teaching, "Modesty helps one to progress, while complacency makes one lag behind," to educate everyone and examine the work. Everyone deeply realized that their work was related to the socialist construction of the motherland and also to the safety of the lives of workers. We must do a better job in the treatment of burned patients. Under the Party's guidance, everyone expressed their determination to rescue patients at all costs, with full confidence, no matter how severe the patient's injuries. After overcoming complacency, a new situation emerged in rescue work. In order to rescue a patient who had both an open fracture of the skull after being burned and had been in a coma for 17 days, we invited neurosurgery nurses for consultation and humbly learned from them the knowledge of continuous low-temperature nursing to carry out rescue work. In order to overcome a key problem in treatment, we often sought advice everywhere, sometimes inviting students and workers from medical equipment factories to participate in consultations. In order to sweep the floor and make the bed without raising dust, ward nurses went to the streets to learn from sanitation workers. In this way, learning from everywhere and striving for cooperation in all aspects, with the support and help of various relevant units, we rescued many patients who were previously considered impossible to rescue. For example, for patients with five major hemorrhages and five shocks after being burned, for patients with two pulmonary embolisms, and for patients with sepsis leading to anuria after being burned (all of which are considered fatal in international literature), we used the spirit of bold creation, continuous revolution, and rescuing to the end to rescue them, allowing them to regain their lives and participate in socialist construction.

Overcoming Difficulties, Adhering to Continuous
Revolutionary Spirit, Continuously Leaping Forward.

The successful rescue of Qiu Caikang brought national trust in Guangci Hospital's treatment of severely burned patients. Patients from other places were transferred one after another, and the consultation tasks in other places were also extremely busy. Our medical personnel could not be supplemented in time. Sometimes, most of the doctors were on business trips, leaving only two doctors in the ward. At that time, some medical personnel developed a fear of difficulty to some extent. Due to the rapid increase and turnover of patients, a nurse often had to care for two or three critically ill patients at the same time. The implementation of disinfection and isolation in the ward was not strict enough for a time, and cross-infection of "drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus" occurred. At the beginning of this year, two patients in a row developed sepsis from this bacteria. This was a very serious problem for the ward. Foreign literature calls this situation "Staphylococcus aureus plague," which is the "inevitable consequence" of admitting large numbers of severely burned patients. According to their view, the ward should be closed for three months to allow the drug resistance of the bacteria to disappear naturally. Were we really willing to sit and wait for the ward to be closed for three months, or to let the bacteria continue to take the precious lives of patients? No! Man proposes, God disposes, and even with few people, we can accomplish great things. After repeated "brainstorming," we mobilized all positive factors and fully exerted the subjective initiative of every staff member, overcoming the fear of difficulty. Everyone vowed to eliminate drug-resistant bacteria and conquer "sepsis" without increasing personnel or closing the ward. Comrades boldly imagined and decided to attack drug-resistant bacteria from three aspects, so medical staff moved together. Comrades engaged in the burn treatment machine, in order to find some physical factors that could both enhance the body's resistance and kill bacteria in the blood, they repeatedly experimented and failed many times, and finally found the required power. Then, with the cooperation of the medical equipment factory, they created a burn treatment machine, which achieved preliminary success in the animal model experiment of sepsis. When doing in vitro experiments, because the biochemical factors and enzyme system in the stored blood were not very stable, the students participating in the experiment secretly drew their own fresh blood to do the experiment in order to accelerate the success of the experiment. Under the guidance of the idea of continuous revolution, even nurses who had never done the simplest microbiological operations liberated their minds and bravely took on the bacterial testing of all personnel in the entire ward, from culture inoculation and various drug sensitivity tests to rinsing petri dishes, disinfecting test tubes, and preparing culture media, all of which were included. In order to rush to rescue patients, everyone fought continuously for three days and completed more than 6,000 experiments, finally finding an effective drug to kill the bacteria, basically eliminating the bacteria of the staff and avoiding cross-infection of drug-resistant bacteria. In order to disinfect precision instruments, we decided to carry out gas disinfection, but we needed a set of automated electric heating equipment. What if we couldn't get it? The nurses used their brains to replace it with a local method, carrying buckets of hot water back and forth, and then pressing pieces of towels on the steel barrel mouth, intermittently forcing the gas out. After repeated experiments, a series of technical problems were solved. Later, with the assistance of comrades from the Chemical Industry Bureau, a gas disinfection method with great significance was successfully tested. In order to completely solve the cross-infection of bacteria, it is necessary to attach importance to strict disinfection and isolation work ideologically and abide by the disinfection and isolation system. Thanks to the above measures, the recently admitted patients with an area of 94% (42% of the third degree area) have not experienced severe sepsis, fundamentally ensuring the safe treatment of patients.

Vigorously Promote the Combination of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, and Strive to Create a New School of Medicine

We were lagging behind the Hypertension Research Institute of our hospital in the work of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine and creating a new school of medicine. Some people always thought that others had good conditions and we were starting too late to catch up. Some comrades also saw that they were lagging behind, but they dared not admit it. Since the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Industrial Conference, the entire Shanghai has set off a mass movement climax of technological revolution and comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. Everyone felt that the situation was even more pressing; also seeing that the Hypertension Research Institute had achieved many remarkable achievements and also proposed to conquer hypertension and set the overall situation within a year, many people, linking it to their own work, felt that this would not work. The Party organization saw this situation and immediately mobilized the masses to learn from the Hypertension Research Institute, vigorously promote the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and urgently catch up. At the same time, it also pointed out that this lagging state is objectively existing, not because of starting too late, but because of being brave to admit it and catching up. After discussion, we strengthened our confidence and put forward the slogan of "Catch up with the Hypertension Research Institute, compare with the Hypertension Research Institute, and surpass the Hypertension Research Institute," and immediately established a traditional Chinese medicine assault team to carry out the burn research work combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and determined the law of imbalance of Yin and Yang and dialectical treatment after studying severe burns. We went everywhere to find equipment if we didn't have it. If we encountered a key problem, we would resolutely attack it. If we didn't have a laboratory, we would do it in the autopsy room under the stairs. If the animals got cold at night, we would mobilize everyone to collect oil felt and broken blankets to keep the rabbits warm. After more than a month of hard work, we finally succeeded in manufacturing a model of infected animals, basically mastered the law of imbalance of Yin and Yang after burns, and wrote three papers on the treatment of severe burns based on TCM dialectical theory. In clinical application, we creatively applied qi-tonifying drugs to improve the body's resistance. This created conditions for eliminating "sepsis" and took an important step in the task of creating a new school of medicine.

Since the successful rescue of Qiu Caikang in 1958, the Party has always taught us to never be satisfied, to continuously revolutionize, break superstition, rescue patients to the end, and make this communist red flag fly forever. We listened to the Party's words, constantly used Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding ideology, and drew the driving force for advancement from the great communist qualities of the working class. We not only cured seriously burned patients, but also trained our medical staff, and our ideological outlook has also changed greatly. Most of our patients are workers. They suffered serious injuries, but they still never forgot production, and they are loyal to the Party and the cause of the proletarian revolution. The noble qualities of this working class gave our medical staff a very deep feeling. For example, a burn patient who had recovered knew that the blood of a recovered burn patient contained substances that resist burn toxins. He took the initiative to ask to have his serum transfused to a child with severe sepsis after being burned, and finally regained this dying little life. There are many such examples with a communist style. Therefore, moving stories are spread among the staff, and these moving examples, like the heroic deeds of Wu Yunduo and Xiang Xiuli, constantly educate our medical workers. Therefore, although we have few people and heavy tasks, we realize that our work is for the safety of the lives of our class brothers and also for the cause of socialist and communist construction in the motherland. Therefore, in the past two years, we have always maintained a strong fighting will. Under the leadership of the Party, we have mobilized the masses and achieved comprehensive and continuous leaps forward in the prevention, treatment, scientific research, and teaching of burns. All staff adhered to the path of being both red and expert, all participated in the study of Mao Zedong's works and the Red Flag reading movement, and seriously studied and discussed books such as "On Contradiction," "Reform Our Study," and "A Brief History of the Party," The political atmosphere in the ward is very active, and the spiritual outlook is undergoing profound changes. Through the rescue of Qiu Caikang and through the education of realistic life in the past two years, our comrades have developed deep feelings for the patients. The relationship between doctors and patients and between people has undergone fundamental changes. For the sake of the patients, resident doctors rarely go home. Occasionally, when they go back once, they also care about the patients in their hearts. When the wind picks up in the middle of the night, they call the comrades on duty to ask about the temperature in the ward, fearing that the patients will catch a cold. When there are critically ill patients, senior doctors, like everyone else, stay with the patients day and night for several weeks without going home, and when they are tired, they sleep on the floor in the office. Our nurses not only provide meticulous and patient care to patients who are strong-willed and can cooperate with the staff, but also treat those patients who are irritated by the pain in the same kind way. In very individual cases, there are such patients: for example, a young patient was very seriously burned (total area 85%, third degree accounted for 45%), and his temper was particularly irritable, refusing to take medicine and refusing to be injected. A new nurse, treating such a comrade, not only did not get annoyed, but gathered with everyone to study and analyze the reasons, expressing that she must take care of him with greater patience and care for his distress. The comrades taught him to read and told him the story of Huang Jiguang whenever they had time; he liked to eat sesame cakes, and the nurse bought them for him before going to work, which moved the young man. Recently, after returning to his hometown, he used some of the superficial characters he had just learned to write a passionate letter, with every word filled with gratitude to Chairman Mao, expressing his love for the new society, and telling us that he had raised a few chickens in his hometown, and when the chickens grow up, he will send them to the nurse sisters to eat. This new type of relationship between medical staff and patients with a communist style is the result of putting politics in command. Medical staff said: In this combat-oriented work of rescuing patients, we not only saved patients, but also transformed our thinking. In the past two years, if our work has achieved a little bit of success, it is the result of putting politics in command, listening to the Party's words, studying Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, and acting in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

The burn ward, from rescuing a Qiu Caikang to curing a large number of seriously burned patients, is a process of continuous revolution, giving full play to hard work, striving for the top, and being a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought guiding the medical and health cause. We are determined to continue to hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to continuous revolution, adhere to the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, attack the cutting edge of burns, and make greater and better achievements for creating a new school of medicine.

    坚持不断革命精神，攀登医学科学高峰
    上海第二医学院附属广慈医院外科代表　董方中
    上海第二医学院附属广慈医院灼伤病房，在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，坚持了政治挂帅，坚持了不断革命的精神，贯彻了卫生工作为生产服务的方针，在灼伤治疗工作上，完全改变了过去的面貌，取得一定的成绩。
    解放前，广慈医院是帝国主义对我国进行文化侵略的工具之一，管理制度十分腐败，技术低劣。自医院创办到解放前为止，治疗严重灼伤病人绝大多数都是死亡的。大跃进以来，医务人员破除了迷信，解放了思想。在短短两年中，使我们病房继抢救丘财康之后又治疗了严重灼伤病员二百五十名，治愈率达80．6％，大大超越了资本主义国家治愈率的水平。按照美英资本主义国家的文献报告，近十年来，他们对于严重灼伤病人的治愈率一直停留在50％左右。
    近两年来，我们克服了人员较少的困难，外出到全国四十个省市，进行了六十一次的会诊抢救工作。与此同时，我们还在科学研究工作中大搞群众运动，在兄弟学校的协作下，完成了有一定水平的论文十七篇，用自己的资料写成了“严重灼伤治疗学”，解决了严重灼伤治疗的关键问题。在这两年的战斗生活里，我们为全国各地培养了烧伤专业医师六十七名，护士五十三名，在医学院的外科总论教学中，围绕着烧伤来讲授外科基本问题，建立了一门新的学科体系。
    两年来，我们是沿着以下的道路前进的。
    政治挂帅，不断破除迷信，
    戒骄戒躁，坚持抢救病人
    1958年抢救丘财康成功后，烧伤病房被誉为一面红旗，这是党和群众给予我们的荣誉。但由此有人却开始滋长了跃进到顶的骄傲自满情绪。1958年年底，我们在进行紧张的医疗任务的同时，配合了“生命的凯歌”影片的拍摄，完成了“严重灼伤治疗学”的编写，也抢救了许多严重的灼伤病员，有的同志对已有的经验与成绩产生了迷信，认为经验已经成熟了，“我们不能解决的问题别人也未必有办法”，“工作已经做到这样，再跃进就困难了”，“抢救病人是经常性的紧张任务，再搞运动就更紧张了”。从此以后，有些人会诊时不再那么虚心，千方百计抢救病人也不再那么强调了。党组织发觉了这种跃进到顶的骄傲自满情绪，就以毛主席所教导的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的名言来教育大家，检查了工作，大家都深刻地认识到自己的工作是关系着祖国的社会主义建设，也关系着工人同志的生命安全，一定要把灼伤病人的治疗工作，做得好了还要好。在党的教导下，大家纷纷表示了决心，提出不管病员伤势多么严重，都要千方百计满怀信心的抢救病人到底。克服了自满情绪以后，在抢救工作上又出现了新的局面。为了抢救一个烧伤后同时还有颅骨开放性骨折、已经昏迷达十七天的病员，我们邀请了神经外科护士会诊，虚心地向她们学习了持续低温的护理知识，进行了抢救工作。为了攻克一个治疗上的关键问题，我们往往四处请教，有时把学生和医疗器械厂的工人都请来参加会诊。为了要扫地铺床不起灰尘，病房护士在马路上向清洁工人跟班学习。就这样到处取经学习，争取各方面的大协作，我们在各个有关单位的支持与帮助下，抢救了许多过去认为不可能抢救的病员，例如对灼伤后五次大出血和五次休克的病员，对并发过二次肺拴塞的病员，对灼伤后并发败血症以致尿闭的病员（这许多都是国际文献中认为必死无疑的），我们都以大胆创造，不断革命，抢救到底的精神，把他们抢救了过来，使他们重获生命，参加了社会主义建设。
      战胜困难，坚持不断
          革命精神，不断跃进。
    抢救丘财康的成功，带来了全国对广慈医院治疗严重的灼伤病人的信任。外地病员纷纷转来，同时外地的会诊任务也异常繁忙，我们医务人员的补充一时跟不上，有时候大多数医师都出差了，病室中只剩了两位医师。当时部分医务人员在某种程度上产生了畏难情绪。由于病员的迅速增加和流转，往往由一个护士同时护理二、三个重病人，病室的消毒隔离执行上一时不严，就产生了“抗药性金黄色葡萄球菌”的交叉感染。今年年初，连续有二位病人得了这种细菌的败血症，这对病室来说，是一个非常严重的问题，国外文献把这种情况称之为“金黄色葡萄球的恶疫”，是大批收治严重灼伤病员的“必然后果”。按他们的讲法，应该把病室封闭三个月，让细菌的抗药性自然消失。难道我们真甘心坐待病室关闭三个月，或是让细菌继续夺取病员宝贵的生命吗？不！事在人为，人少也要办大事。经过反复务虚，我们调动了一切积极因素，充分发挥了每一个工作人员的主观能动作用，克服了畏难情绪，大家都誓下决心，一定要在不增加人员，不关闭病房的前提下，消灭抗药细菌，攻克“败血症”。同志们大胆设想，决定从三方面猛攻抗药细菌，于是医护人员一齐动起来了。搞灼伤治疗机的同志，为了寻求某种既能增强机体抗力，又能杀灭血液中细菌的物理因素，他们反复试验，屡次失败，最后终于找到了所要求的功率，进而在医疗器械厂的协作下，创制成功了一架灼伤治疗机，在败血症的动物模型试验上获得初步成功。在作离体试验时，由于库存的血液中生化因子及酶的系统不太稳定，参加实验的学生，都背着老师偷偷地抽自己的鲜血来做试验，以加速试验的成功。在不断革命的思想指导下，连过去最简单的微生物操作都没有做过的护士同志也解放了思想，勇敢地承担了全病室人员的带菌试验，从培养接种及各种药物的敏感试验，到冲洗平皿，消毒试管，配制培养基，全部包了下来。为了急于抢救病员，大家持续奋战了三天，完成了六千余次试验，终于找到了杀灭细菌的有效药物，基本消灭了工作人员带菌，避免了抗药细菌的交叉感染。为了消毒精密的仪器，我们决定了搞气体消毒法，但需要一套自动化的电热设备，搞不到怎么办呢？护士同志开动脑筋，用土办法来代替，上下来回地把一桶桶的热水提来，再用一块块的毛巾压在钢桶口上，断断续续地将气体逼出来，经过反复试验，解决了一系列的技术问题。后来，在化工局同志的协助下，试验成功了具有重大意义的气体消毒法。为了彻底解决细菌的交叉感染，需要从思想上重视严格的消毒隔离工作，遵守消毒隔离制度。由于采取了以上种种措施，在最近收治的面积达94％（三度面积42％）的病员，没有发生过严重的败血症，从根本上保证了病员的安全治疗。
    大搞中西医结合，为创立新医
        学派而奋斗
    我们在中西医结合，创立新医学派的工作上，落后于我院高血压研究所，有些人总认为人家条件好，我们起步太慢赶不上了。有些同志虽也看到自己落后了，但又不敢承认落后。自中共上海市委召开工业会议以后，整个上海都掀起了技术革命和比、学、赶、帮的群众运动高潮，大家感到形势更加逼人；又看到高血压研究所已取得了不少显著的成就，还提出了要在一年内征服高血压定大局的雄心大志，很多人联系到自己的工作，感到这样下去不行了。党组织看到了这一状况，立即发动群众向高血压研究所学习，大搞中西医结合，急起直追迎头赶。同时也指出这种落后状态是客观存在，不在于起步太迟，而在于是勇于承认，迎头赶上。经过讨论，坚定了信心，提出了“赶高血压研究所，比高血压研究所，超高血压研究所”的口号，立即成立了祖国医学突击小组，开展了中西医结合的灼伤研究工作，确定了研究严重灼伤后阴阳失调和辨证论治疗的规律。我们没有器械就到处去找，遇到关键后就坚决的攻，没有实验室，就在楼梯下尸体解剖室里做，晚上动物冷了，就发动大家到处收集油毛毡及破毯子给兔子取暖。经过一个多月的奋战，终于制造成功了感染动物的模型，基本上掌握了灼伤后阴阳失调的规律，写成了中医辨证论治疗严重灼伤的论文三篇，在临床应用上，创造性地应用补气药物，提高了机体抵抗力，这样为消灭“败血症”创造了条件，在创立新医学派的任务中迈出了重要的一步。
    自1958年抢救丘财康成功以后，党一直教导我们，要永不满足，要不断革命，破除迷信，抢救病人到底，使这面共产主义红旗永远飘扬。我们听了党的话，不断地以毛泽东思想作为指导思想，从工人阶级伟大的共产主义品质中吸取前进的动力。我们不仅治愈了严重灼伤的病人，而且锻炼了我们医务人员，思想面貌也有了很大改变。我们的病员大多数是工人，他们身受重伤，还念念不忘生产，他们忠于党、忠于无产阶级革命事业。这种工人阶级的高尚品质，给予我们医务人员感受极深。比如有一个已痊愈的烧伤病人，他知道已经痊愈的烧伤病人血中有抵抗烧伤毒素的物质，他主动地要求将自己的血清输给一位烧伤后患有严重败血症的小孩，终于夺回了这条奄奄一息的小生命。像这样具有共产主义风格的例子是很多的。因此在工作人员中就传播着一个个动人的故事，这些动人事例也像吴运铎、向秀丽的英雄事迹一样，不断地教育着我们的医务工作者。因此虽然我们人员少，任务重，但是我们认识到我们的工作是为着我们的阶级弟兄的生命安全，也是为着祖国的社会主义和共产主义建设事业。因此两年来，我们始终保持了旺盛的战斗意志，在党的领导下发动了群众，在灼伤的预防、治疗、科研及教学工作上，都取得了全面持续的跃进。全体工作人员坚持了又红又专的道路，全部参加了毛泽东著作和红旗读书运动的学习，认真地学习讨论了“矛盾论”、“改造我们的学习”、“党史简编”等书籍，病房内政治空气非常活跃，精神面貌起着深刻的变化。通过抢救丘财康，通过两年来现实生活的教育，我们的同志对病人都产生了深厚的感情。医生与病人之间，人与人的关系起了根本性的变化。为了病人，住院医师很少回家，偶尔回去一次，心中也惦记着病人，半夜起风了，就打电话给值班的同志，询问病室的温度，深怕病人受凉。有了重危病人，高级医师也像大家一样，连续几个星期夜以继日的守在病人身旁不回家去，倦了就在办公室里打个地铺睡觉。我们的护士同志，不仅对意志坚强能与工作人员合作的病人进行细致耐心的护理，即使那些被病痛折磨得脾气转为急躁的病员，也是同样和蔼对待。在极个别的情况下，也有这样的病人：如有一位青年病员灼伤非常严重（总面积85％，三度占45％），脾气特别急躁，不肯吃药，不愿打针。有位新护士，对待这样一位同志，不但不恼火，反而和大家聚在一起研究分析原因，表示一定要以更大的耐心去护理他，体贴他的苦恼。同志们一有空就教他读书，讲黄继光的故事给他听；他喜欢吃芝麻饼，护士上班前就给他买来，这些都感动了这位小青年。最近他回乡后用他刚学到的一些粗浅文字，写来了一封热情洋溢的信，字里行间充满了对毛主席的感激，表达了对新社会的热爱，并且告诉我们，他在乡下养了几只小鸡，等鸡养大，送给护士姐姐们吃。这种新型的、具有共产主义风格的医护人员与病人的关系，是政治挂帅的结果。医务人员说：我们在这种战斗性的抢救病人的工作中，不仅救活了病人，同时也改造了我们的思想。两年来，我们的工作如果说能获得点滴成绩的话，那就是政治挂帅，听党的话，学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，并按照毛泽东思想办事的结果。
    灼伤病房从抢救一个丘财康到治愈大批严重灼伤病人，这是一个不断革命，鼓足干劲，力争上游的过程，是毛泽东思想指导医药卫生事业的巨大胜利。我们决心，继续高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持不断革命，坚持中西医结合，猛攻灼伤尖端，为创立新医学派，作出更大更好的成就。
