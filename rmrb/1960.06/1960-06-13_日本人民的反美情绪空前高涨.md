Japanese People's Anti-American Sentiment Soars to Unprecedented Heights
By Our Commentator

Recently, the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan has intensified day by day. This struggle has become a major part of the Japanese people's current anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle. When U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty arrived in Tokyo, the Japanese people once again demonstrated their strong will to resolutely oppose Eisenhower's activities in Japan.

Hagerty came to Tokyo as the "advance man" of the American president to scout the way. Although the Washington authorities, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people, insisted that Eisenhower would "visit" Japan on June 19, they could not help but worry about the strong anti-Eisenhower sentiment of the Japanese people. Therefore, in addition to asking the Kishi Nobusuke group to make various "security measures", the U.S. government specially sent the president's confidant to Japan to see the situation, test the waters, and make some "appropriate" arrangements. The Japanese people, who firmly opposed Eisenhower's visit to Japan, erupted with irrepressible anger at Hagerty's arrival, giving the American president's special envoy a head-on blow with a massive demonstration.

Hagerty's embarrassing plight on the afternoon of June 10 at Tokyo's Haneda Airport and on the road to the U.S. Embassy, when he was angrily driven away by the Japanese people, shows that the days of American imperialism's rampant tyranny in Japan will not last long. Surrounded by the angry Japanese people, Hagerty escaped from the airport with the help of a helicopter, and a dignified "guest" could only sneak into the U.S. Embassy through the back door like a mangy dog. This ugly state of affairs obviously cannot be concealed by the feigned "calmness" of the likes of Hagerty. The day before yesterday, more than 200,000 Japanese people held a massive demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy, and the roar of "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan" and "Yankees go home" resounded through the sky. This was just a small lesson given to the American special envoy by the Japanese people. Hagerty, who sneaked back home, should understand what kind of "welcome" Eisenhower will receive when he arrives in Japan.

The reason why the Japanese people so strongly oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan is not only because they know that Eisenhower is going to Japan to support Kishi Nobusuke, who is unanimously opposed by the Japanese people, and to encourage the Kishi Nobusuke group to force the Japanese Senate to finally "approve" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. According to a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington on the 5th, U.S. diplomatic officials revealed that Kishi Nobusuke had recently pleaded bitterly with his American masters at the White House not to cancel his visit to Japan, saying: "If U.S. President Eisenhower cancels his visit to Japan, the Kishi cabinet will collapse, and the future of the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will be extremely pessimistic." The U.S. side had publicly stated that the Kishi Nobusuke group must greet Eisenhower's "arrival" with the final "passage" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty by the Diet. Following the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's commencement of deliberations on the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on June 7, the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately began a separate "deliberation" of the treaty in the Japanese Senate on the 8th; and decided that on the day after the U.S. Senate vote on the 14th, the Japanese Senate, composed only of Liberal Democratic Party members, would "vote" on this treaty. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan is also their struggle against the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. But, more importantly, the reason why the Japanese people so strongly oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan is that they increasingly realize that American imperialism is the main enemy of the Japanese people. To oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, we must first oppose American imperialism, which created this aggressive treaty, and therefore we cannot but oppose Eisenhower, the head of American imperialism, visiting Japan. Recently, the Japanese people have linked the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, forcing the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet, and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government, with the struggle to demand the withdrawal of U.S. U-2 spy planes from Japan, the struggle to demand the cancellation of U.S. military bases in Japan, and the struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The current struggle of the Japanese people has taken on a clear anti-American imperialist nature, and the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people has soared to unprecedented heights.

The unprecedented surge in the Japanese people's anti-American sentiment has made American imperialism, which is trying to plan a new war through the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, panic-stricken. While the United States is exclaiming that the anti-American situation in Japan is seriously "unexpected", it is using all kinds of sinister means to try to undermine this glorious, patriotic, and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against the American president's activities in Japan. In addition to ordering its Japanese lackey, Kishi Nobusuke, to carry out bloody suppression of the Japanese people in the name of demanding "guaranteeing the safety of Eisenhower's visit to Japan," the U.S. government is also using all its propaganda machines to slander and attack the Japanese people's struggle. They insist that the movement against Eisenhower's visit to Japan does not represent the will of the Japanese people, that opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan is not anti-American, and Kishi Nobusuke even openly slandered the Japanese people's struggle as "incited by international communism," foreshadowing the bloody suppression of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle in the future.

It is worth noting that in recent days, as the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has entered a critical juncture, some Japanese bourgeois newspapers have begun to change their tune, following the instructions of American imperialism, and issuing arguments attacking the Japanese people's struggle against the American president's visit to Japan. They desperately distort and attack the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi demonstrations that surrounded Hagerty, they try to conceal the sinister purpose of Eisenhower's activities in Japan, and spread the word that he came for U.S.-Japan "friendship". Some newspapers even blatantly threaten the Japanese people, saying that the movement to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's "behavior" involves anti-American sentiment, which may cause "extremely unpleasant results" for present-day Japan. Obviously, the purpose of this kind of rhetoric that reverses right and wrong and spreads alarmist talk is not only to "welcome" Eisenhower's activities in Japan, but more importantly to fundamentally undermine the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism and prevent the continued development of the Japanese people's anti-American sentiment. However, no matter how many tricks American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries play, the broad masses of the Japanese people, who have been tempered by constant struggle, cannot be intimidated. The Japanese people have decided to hold larger-scale strikes from the 15th, and to hold larger-scale demonstrations on the day Eisenhower arrives.

The Japanese people's demand for independence and autonomy is unstoppable, and therefore their struggle against American imperialist aggression and enslavement cannot be stopped by any force. The Japanese people demand that they become a force for maintaining peace in Asia and the world, rather than serving as American imperialism's cannon fodder for aggression. Therefore, they will persevere in their struggle to smash the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to plan a new war and to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. When the Japanese people increasingly realize that American imperialism is their main enemy, any attempt by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to divert their attention and stop the struggle will inevitably fail. The fact that the Japanese people are victoriously launching the 18th National Unified Action with unparalleled fighting spirit and heroism is a powerful proof.

    日本人民的反美情绪空前高涨
    本报评论员
    最近以来，日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争，一天比一天高涨。这个斗争已成为日本人民当前反美反岸斗争的一个主要部分。在美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂到东京的时候，日本人民再一次显示出了他们坚决反对艾森豪威尔到日本活动的强烈意志。
    哈格蒂是作为美国总统的“先行官”到东京探路的。尽管华盛顿当局不顾日本人民的反对，坚持艾森豪威尔要在6月19日到日本进行“访问”，但是他们对于日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的强烈情绪不能不忧心忡忡。因此美国政府除了要求岸信介集团作好各种“保安措施”之外，还特意派了总统的亲信到日本去看看风色，试试脚步，同时再作一番“妥善”的布置。坚决反对艾森豪威尔访日的日本人民对于哈格蒂的到来，爆发了不可遏制的愤怒，以巨大规模的示威，给了美国总统的这位专使以迎头痛击。
    哈格蒂6月10日下午在东京羽田机场和到美国大使馆路上时遭到日本人民愤怒驱逐的狼狈相，表明了美帝国主义在日本横行霸道的日子不会有多久了。在日本人民愤怒的包围之下，哈格蒂靠了直升飞机的搭救才逃出了机场，而堂堂一个“贵宾”只能像癞皮狗一样从后门钻进美国大使馆，这种丑态，显然不是哈格蒂之流故作“镇静”所能掩盖得了的。前天又有二十多万日本人民在美国使馆门外举行了声势浩大的示威，“反对艾森豪威尔访日”、“美国佬滚回去”的吼声响彻云霄。这只是日本人民给予美国专使一点小小的教训。偷偷溜回国去了的哈格蒂自当明白艾森豪威尔到日本的时候，将会受到什么样的“欢迎”。
    日本人民所以如此强烈反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，这不仅因为他们知道艾森豪威尔到日本去，为的是要给被日本人民一致反对的岸信介撑腰，为的是要给岸信介集团强使日本参议院最后“批准”日美军事同盟条约打气。据共同社驻华盛顿记者5日报道，美国外交当局人士透露，岸信介最近向白宫苦苦哀求美国主子千万不要取消对日本的访问，他表示：“如果美国总统艾森豪威尔取消访问日本，那么岸内阁将会崩溃，新日美安全条约成立的前途也将是极其悲观的”。而美国方面曾经公开表示岸信介集团必须以国会最后“通过”日美军事同盟条约来迎接艾森豪威尔的“光临”。岸信介政府继美国参议院外交委员会在6月7日开始审议日美军事同盟条约以后，已立刻于8日在日本参议院开始对条约进行单独“审议”；并且决定在14日美国参议院表决的第二天，由只有清一色自由民主党议员的日本参议院“表决”这个条约。因此，日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访日的斗争，也是他们反对批准日美军事同盟条约的斗争。但是，更重要的，日本人民所以如此强烈反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，还因为他们越来越认识到，美帝国主义是日本人民最主要的敌人。反对日美军事同盟条约，首先必须反对制造这个侵略性条约的美帝国主义，也就不能不反对美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔访问日本。最近日本人民已经把反对日美军事同盟条约、迫使岸信介政府解散国会、打倒岸信介政府的斗争，同要求美国U—2型间谍飞机撤出日本的斗争，要求取消美国在日本的军事基地的斗争，反对艾森豪威尔访日的斗争连成一片。日本人民的当前斗争已经具有了明确的反对美帝国主义的性质，日本人民反美情绪空前高涨。
    日本人民反美情绪的空前高涨，使得亟图通过日美军事同盟条约策划新战争的美帝国主义惶惶不安。美国在惊呼日本的反美形势严重得“出乎意料”的同时，正在使出一切阴谋手段，极力破坏日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美国总统到日本活动的这一光荣的爱国正义斗争。美国政府除了以要求“保证艾森豪威尔访日的安全”为名，指令它的日本走狗岸信介对日本人民进行血腥镇压；并且开动所有的宣传机器，对日本人民的斗争大肆诬蔑攻击。他们硬说反对艾森豪威尔访日的运动并不代表日本人民的意志，反对艾森豪威尔访日并不是反美的，岸信介甚至公然诬蔑日本人民的斗争是“国际共产主义煽动的”，为日后血腥镇压日本人民的爱国正义斗争，预伏下杀机。
    值得注意的是，近几天来，在日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争进入重要关头的时候，日本某些资产阶级报纸已经开始改变腔调，遵照美帝国主义的指使，发出攻击日本人民反对美国总统访日斗争的论调。他们拼命歪曲、攻击日本人民包围哈格蒂的反美反岸示威，他们力图掩饰艾森豪威尔到日本活动的阴谋目的，散布他是为了日美“亲善”而来的。有的报纸甚至明目张胆地威胁日本人民说，反对岸信介的“行为”的运动牵连到反美感情，这样恐怕将会对于现在的日本造成“极不愉快的结果”。显而易见，这类颠倒是非、危言恫吓的论调，其目的决不止于“欢迎”艾森豪威尔到日本活动，而更重要的是企图从根本上破坏日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争、阻止日本人民反美情绪的继续发展。然而，不论美帝国主义和日本反动派再耍多少手段，经过不断斗争锻炼的广大日本人民是吓不倒的。日本人民已经决定从15日起举行更大规模的罢工，在艾森豪威尔到来之日，举行更大规模的示威。
    日本人民独立自主的要求是不可遏制的，因此，他们反对美帝国主义侵略和奴役的斗争也是任何力量所阻挡不了的。日本人民要求自己成为维护亚洲和世界和平的力量，而不是充当美帝国主义的侵略炮灰，因此，他们必将为粉碎美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋、为废除日美军事同盟的条约而坚持斗争。当日本人民已经越来越认识到美帝国主义是他们的主要敌人的时候，美日反动派任何转移目标、阻止斗争的阴谋企图都不能不遭到失败。日本人民正在以无比激昂的斗志和英勇气概胜利展开第十八次全国统一行动，就是一个有力的证明。
