Ode to Fire (and another poem)
    --Dedicated to Kazuko Kanba, victim of the “June 15th” Massacre
    Tian Jian

    I. The angry tide of struggle surges to the sky,
    A heroic woman is like a flame,
    Her roar is like the ocean's long howl,
    Her hot blood like red roses.

    II. Anger has forged sharp blades,
    Hot blood assaults the Japanese "Diet,"
    The "plague god's" lifespan won't be long,
    The tyrant's palace is bound to collapse.

    III. Child of the fires of Mount Fuji,
    It is you waving your arms,
    The Pacific Ocean cries day and night,
    It is still you speaking out,
    Fire, fire, burn on,
    Until the shackles are shattered…

    To Japan

    Swords of anger are needed,
    Why use snow as a helmet? (Note)
    The flag of fire must be raised high,
    Anklets and handcuffs must be shattered.
    Where white snow covers the land,
    Blooming fiery red roses.
    We cheer Mount Fuji,
    The volcano will become a free sky!

      (Note) The summit of Mount Fuji is covered with snow all year round, resembling a helmet made of snow.

   火颂（外一首）
    ——为“六·一五”血案的牺牲者桦美智子作
    田间
    一斗争的怒潮冲天，英雄女子似火焰，吼声如大海长啸，热血像红色玫瑰。
    二怒火铸成了利刃，热血冲击了日本“国会”，“瘟神”的寿命长不了，暴君之宫必崩溃。
    三富士山火的孩子，是你在挥舞手臂，太平洋日夜呼号，是你仍然在发言，火呀，火呀燃烧吧，直到镣铐粉碎……
    致日本需用怒火作刀剑，何用白雪作头盔？（注）火的旗子要高举，脚镣手铐要粉碎。白雪笼罩的地方，开出火红的玫瑰。我们欢呼富士山，火山要变自由天！
      （注）富士山的山顶，长年披着白雪，犹如白雪作的头盔。
