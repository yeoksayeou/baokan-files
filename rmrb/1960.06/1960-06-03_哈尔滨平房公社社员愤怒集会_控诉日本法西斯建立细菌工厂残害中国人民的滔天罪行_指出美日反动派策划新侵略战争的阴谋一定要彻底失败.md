Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 29th: Members of the Pingfang Urban People's Commune in Harbin, the site of the former Japanese fascist germ factory more than twenty years ago, have been holding rallies in recent days. Many people who suffered persecution by the Japanese fascists accused them at the meetings of the heinous crimes committed by the Japanese fascists in the Pingfang area and expressed their firm support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

The people who participated in the rally revealed that in 1939, the Japanese fascists established a brutal germ factory here. This germ factory had a special flea breeding ground for propagating plague, a toxin institute for cultivating cholera, canker disease, anthrax fever, typhoid fever and paratyphoid, a laboratory, and facilities such as rat cages for breeding bacteria. In addition, there was a "human refining furnace." While producing a large number of bacteria in this inhuman factory, the Japanese fascists also conducted large-scale experiments with living people. Many Chinese patriots, heroes of the anti-Japanese war, and many Soviet and Mongolian citizens lost their lives in this brutal germ factory. From 1940 to 1945, more than 3,000 people were killed by bacteria in this germ factory. From 1940 to 1942, the Japanese fascists also spread plague bacteria in Ningbo, Zhejiang, Changde, Hunan, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, bringing profound disasters to the Chinese people.

Commune member Jing Fuhe accused that, on the eve of the surrender, the brutal Japanese fascists destroyed the Pingfang germ factory in order to eliminate evidence, causing a large number of bacteria-carrying rats to escape and spread to villages near Pingfang, resulting in a major plague epidemic that killed more than 100 people. Thirteen of his family's twenty members died within a few days. He said that the Chinese people who have suffered deeply from the Japanese fascists wholeheartedly support the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and our people will never allow Japanese militarism to revive under a new guise and endanger the people of Asia again. Li Fenglan, a commune member, a mother of five children, whose husband was taken away by the bacteria spread by the Japanese fascists, said that the disasters brought to the Chinese people by the Japanese fascists will never be forgotten by us. We were deprived of our loved ones and lived a difficult life for a long time. The Communist Party came and helped me get rid of the pain. Many Japanese women also lost their loved ones in the war, and their lives are equally painful. Today, the Japanese people have resolutely risen up to oppose the US-Japanese reactionaries' plot to plan a new war of aggression, and we fully support their just struggle. Liu Xiangge's younger brother and sister-in-law were killed by the bacteria manufactured by the Japanese fascists. He said that although the Japanese fascists were ferocious for a period of time, they ultimately failed. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We have the full strength to defend peace, and the US-Japanese reactionaries' dream of enslaving the people of the world will be completely defeated. (Attached picture)

    哈尔滨平房公社社员愤怒集会
    控诉日本法西斯建立细菌工厂残害中国人民的滔天罪行
    指出美日反动派策划新侵略战争的阴谋一定要彻底失败
    新华社哈尔滨5月29日电　二十多年前曾是日本法西斯细菌工厂所在地的哈尔滨平房城市人民公社，社员们连日来纷纷举行集会，许多身受日本法西斯迫害的人们在会上控诉了日本法西斯在平房地区所犯下的滔天罪行，并且表示坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    参加集会的人们揭露说，1939年日本法西斯在这里建立了惨无人道的细菌工厂。这个细菌工厂设有专门繁殖传播鼠疫的跳蚤繁殖所，培育霍乱、坏疸病、炭疯热病、伤寒及副伤寒的毒菌所、化验所，还有育鼠保菌鼠笼等设施。另外还设有“炼人炉”。日本法西斯在这座灭绝人性的工厂里生产大量细菌的同时，还大规模地用活人作试验。许多中国的爱国志士、抗日英雄，许多苏联和蒙古公民，在这惨无人道的细菌工厂里断送了生命。从1940年到1945年，在这个细菌工厂中被细菌杀死的达三千余人。日本法西斯并将生产出来的大量细菌在1940年到1942年间，在我国浙江宁波和湖南常德以及长江下流等地散布鼠疫毒菌，给我国人民带来了深重的灾难。
    社员靖福和控诉说，惨无人道的日本法西斯在投降前夕，为了消灭罪证，把平房细菌工厂炸毁，使大量保菌鼠逃出，散布到平房附近各村落，造成了鼠疫大流行，死亡一百多人。他家二十口人，几天时间就死了十三口。他说，深受日本法西斯灾害的中国人民衷心支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，我国人民决不容许日本军国主义在新的招牌下复活，再来危害亚洲人民。被日本法西斯散播的细菌夺去了丈夫的公社社员、五个孩子的妈妈李凤兰说，日本法西斯给中国人民带来的灾难是我们决不会忘记的。我们被夺去了亲人，长时间过着艰难困苦的生活。共产党来了，帮助我解除了痛苦。日本妇女也有许多人在战争中失去了亲人，她们的生活也同样痛苦。今天日本人民坚决起来反对美日反动派策划新的侵略战争的阴谋，我们完全支持他们的正义斗争。社员刘相阁的弟弟和弟妇都被日本法西斯制造的细菌夺去了生命，他说，日本法西斯虽然凶恶过一个时期，但最后还是失败了。我们热爱和平，但是决不害怕战争，我们完全有力量保卫和平，美日反动派奴役世界人民的美梦，必将遭到彻底的失败。（附图片）
