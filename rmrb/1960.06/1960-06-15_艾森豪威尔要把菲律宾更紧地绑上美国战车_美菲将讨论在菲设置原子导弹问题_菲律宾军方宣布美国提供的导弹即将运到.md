Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: A dispatch from Manila by the Associated Press reveals that Philippine President Garcia has announced that Eisenhower will secretly discuss the deployment of atomic missiles in the Philippines with the Philippine authorities. This further exposes the Eisenhower's sinister plot of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and creating tension in the Far East with this "visit".

According to reports, Garcia and Foreign Minister Serrano have already consulted with Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Romulo, regarding the agenda for the secret talks that Eisenhower will hold with the Philippine authorities during his upcoming visit to the Philippines. However, Philippine officials have not released the content of their discussions.

According to reports, in addition to plotting the deployment of atomic warfare, Eisenhower will also discuss issues of US-Philippine relations with the Philippine authorities, such as the Philippines' request for increased war reparations and the expansion of US jurisdiction over American military personnel at US military bases in the Philippines.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Manila News: Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Cabal announced on the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in the Philippines for a "visit" that the missiles provided by the United States to the Philippine military are "about to arrive."

Prior to this, Foreign Minister Serrano had announced that the missiles the United States had promised to provide to the Philippines included "Sidewinder" missiles and "Honest John" rockets.

At a press conference held on the 13th, Serrano admitted that Eisenhower, who arrived in Manila today, will discuss the issue of the United States providing the Philippines with modern weapons, including missiles, with Philippine President Garcia during his "visit" to the Philippines.
