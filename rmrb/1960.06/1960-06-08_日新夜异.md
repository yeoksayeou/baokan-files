    "Daily Renewal, Nightly Change"
  　By Xi Shen

    "Daily renewal, monthly change" is an idiom used to describe things changing quickly. However, using it to describe the changes in our great era, where "one day equals twenty years," to describe our vigorous people's commune movement, and to describe our rapidly changing, nationwide technological revolution movement, is simply not enough. Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have already used soaring enthusiasm, second-by-second action, and high-speed thinking to break the old convention of "daily renewal, monthly change," and have created a new convention of "daily renewal, nightly change." The "poor and blank" state of our country is not changing at a pace of "daily renewal, monthly change," but is changing at a high speed of "daily renewal, nightly change"! The speed of our country's construction is not advancing with "daily renewal, monthly change," but is advancing with "daily renewal, nightly change"! Our country's technological revolution movement is not developing with "daily renewal, monthly change," but is developing with "daily renewal, nightly change"! This is the great transformation of our great era!

    The workers of the Zhangjiakou Motor Factory fought a great battle overnight, completely realizing high-speed and high-powered cutting of machine tools, increasing efficiency by two to seventy times! The young workers of the Five-Star Brick Factory in Huailai County worked hard overnight to realize brick-making without kilns, reducing the production cycle from seven days to thirty-six hours. Similar examples are numerous. It is truly changing rapidly, "daily renewal, nightly change," in the blink of an eye, the vast landscape is completely renewed. High speed has become the characteristic of our era.

    Our 650 million people have greatly liberated their minds and are no longer content with being "poor and blank." This discontent with being "poor and blank" is not ordinary "discontent," but a high-speed, impatiently demanding change in the status quo. It is precisely this striving for advancement that has promoted the great leap forward in all our work and created thousands upon thousands of miracles of "daily renewal, nightly change"!

    The source of power for "daily renewal, nightly change" is the Party's general line. As long as we follow the Party's general line, exert full effort, and strive for advancement, our production landscape, social landscape, and living landscape will definitely be able to achieve more rapid and better development.

    “日新夜异”
  　溪深
    “日新月异”是一句形容事情变化很快的成语。但是，用它来比喻我们这个“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代的变化，比喻我们的轰轰烈烈的人民公社运动，比喻我们的瞬息万变的全民性的技术革命运动，则是很不够的。我国人民在党的领导下已经用冲天的干劲，分秒必争的行动，高速度的思想，打破了“日新月异”这个老常规，创造出了一个“日新夜异”的新常规。我国“一穷二白”的面貌不是以“日新月异”的速度改变着，而是以“日新夜异”的高速度改变着！我国的建设速度不是“日新月异”地前进着，而是“日新夜异”地前进着！我国的技术革命运动不是“日新月异”地发展着，而是“日新夜异”地发展着！这就是我们这个伟大时代的伟大变革！
    张家口电机厂的职工大战一夜，全部实现机床高速度强力切削，提高效率二倍到七十倍！怀来县五星砖厂青工大干一夜实现无窑烧砖，使生产周期由七天降到三十六小时。类似这样的例子是很多的。真是瞬息万变，“日新夜异”，一眨眼的功夫，万里江山，焕然一新了。高速度成了我们时代的特点。
    我国六亿五千万人民思想大解放，不甘心“一穷二白”了。这种不甘心“一穷二白”，并不是一般的“不甘心”，而是高速度地，急不可待地要求改变现状，正是这种力争上游的思想，促进了我们一切工作的大跃进，创造出了千千万万的“日新夜异”的奇迹！
    “日新夜异”的力量源泉是党的总路线，我们只要按照党的总路线，鼓足干劲、力争上游，我们的生产面貌、社会面貌、生活面貌就一定能够得到更迅速的更好的发展。
