Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 20th: The Lanxin Railway had its tracks laid to the Shisanjianfang Station in Shanshan County on the 14th and is continuing to extend towards Turpan at a rate of more than six kilometers per day.

Shisanjianfang Station is 155 kilometers from Hami, south of Qijiaojing. This place was originally an uninhabited and waterless Gobi Desert, with frequent gales of force 9 or 10 all year round within a hundred miles, and is a famous "Hundred-Li Wind Zone." Railway workers broke the past saying that "track cannot be laid in gales above force 8" and insisted on laying track even in force 10 gales. On the 14th, workers laid 6.6 kilometers of track in all-day gales of force 8 or 9.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Lianhuasi to Wenxiang section of the Longhai Railway double track was opened to traffic on the 12th of this month, more than a year ahead of the original plan.

At 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, Wang Lin, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Subsequently, the train sped eastward along the double track amidst the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers.

This section of the line is 101 kilometers long and was officially started in September 1958. In order to open this section of the line to traffic before the Sanmenxia Reservoir blocked the flood, the railway construction workers and laborers displayed soaring enthusiasm and used more than a year to erect the 54-meter-high Jingo Dadu Bridge, and completed the Niuzhuang more than 1,600-meter double-track soil tunnel a year ahead of schedule, creating a record of 500 meters of tunneling per month from both entrances.

At the celebration meeting for the opening of the Lian-Wen section of the Longhai double track, Yang Zhengmin, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the workers. Hao Yutang, Deputy Secretary of the Xi'an Railway Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China, Luo Zhi, Deputy Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, Zhao Xingren, Secretary of the Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, representatives of the railway construction laborers, and representatives of the railway workers also spoke at the meeting.

    兰新路铺轨进入鄯善县境
    陇海路复线莲花寺至阌乡段通车
    新华社乌鲁木齐20日电　兰新铁路已在14日铺轨到鄯善县境内的十三间房车站，并且正以每天铺轨六公里以上的速度继续向吐鲁番伸延。
    十三间房车站距哈密一百五十五公里，在七角井南面。这个地方原来是一片无人无水的戈壁，附近百里以内终年经常刮九、十级大风，是著名的“百里风区”。铁路职工打破了过去“八级以上大风不能铺轨”的说法，在十级大风中也坚持铺轨。14日职工们在整天八至九级的狂风中，还铺轨六点六公里。
    新华社西安电　陇海铁路复线莲花寺至阌乡段已在本月12日辅轨通车，比原订计划提前了一年多。
    12日上午十一时半，中共陕西省委书记王林主持剪彩仪式。随后，列车在锣鼓、鞭炮声中，沿着复线向东奔驰而去。
    这段线路长一百零一公里，是1958年9月正式施工的。为了使这段路线赶在三门峡水库拦洪前通车，筑路职工和民工发挥了冲天干劲，用了一年多的时间，架起了五十四米高的晋沟大桥，提前一年打通了牛庄一千六百多米的双线土质大隧道，并且创造了双口月进成洞五百米的纪录。
    在庆祝陇海复线莲阌段通车典礼大会上，陕西省副省长杨拯民代表中共陕西省委、省人民委员会，向全体职工表示热烈祝贺和亲切慰问。在会上讲话的，还有中共西安铁路局委员会副书记郝玉堂，郑州铁路局副局长罗智，中共渭南县委书记赵兴仁，筑路民工代表，路工代表等。
