    Fuliji Commune, Wanglou Brigade
    Yangzhuang Canteen Maintains Good Summer Hygiene
    The comrades of our canteen's cooking staff have devised various methods to ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and eat hygienically. They have already ensured that the steamed bun baskets have covers, the food bowls have lids, and the dishes have gauze covers. The dining hall is even cleaner, truly achieving clean walls, clean floors, clean roofs, clean cooking utensils, and no flies or mice.
    In the hot summer, commune members are most prone to thirst during labor. In addition to setting up tea water vats in the canteen, tea water is often delivered to the fields for commune members to drink. Every evening, the canteen also boils several pots of warm water for commune members to wash their faces and bathe, making things convenient for them in every way. The commune members all say that the contributions of the cooking staff comrades should be recorded in the merit book.

    符离公社王楼大队
    杨庄食堂夏季卫生好
    我们食堂的炊事员同志们想出各种办法，使社员吃饱吃好，吃得干净卫生。已经做到了馍筐有笼布，饭盆有盖子，菜有纱罩；饭厅里收拾得更清洁，真正做到了墙净、地净、屋盖净、炊具净和无蝇、无鼠。
    夏季天热，社员们在劳动中最容易口渴，除在食堂内设立茶水缸外，还经常将茶水送到田头，供社员饮用。每天晚上，食堂还烧几锅温水，供给社员晚上洗脸、洗澡用，处处使社员感到方便。社员们都说，应该把炊事员同志们的贡献，记在功劳簿上。
