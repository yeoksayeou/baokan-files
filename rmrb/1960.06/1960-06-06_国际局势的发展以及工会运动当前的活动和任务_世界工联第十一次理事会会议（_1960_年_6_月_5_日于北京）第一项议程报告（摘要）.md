Report on the first item of the agenda of the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (Beijing, June 5, 1960)
(Summary)
Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions
Xinhua News Agency, June 5th - At the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which opened on June 5th in Beijing, Marcel Bras, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on the first item of the meeting's agenda on behalf of Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The report began by stating that this is the first time since the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions that we are holding a council meeting in the capital of the glorious People's Republic of China. He took this opportunity to extend a particularly warm greeting to the Chinese workers and the Chinese trade unions.

The report first reviewed the development of the international situation since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress in 1957.

The report said that three years have passed since our Fourth World Trade Union Congress. These three years have been characterized by the remarkable achievements and unremitting efforts of the socialist camp and all peace forces, as well as various conspiracies by imperialist blocs to obstruct the achievement of peaceful coexistence.

Only three years, but filled with events that have severely tested the hopes and vigilance of the people.

The report pointed out that a few days before the Paris Summit, the U.S. State Department dispatched a military spy plane from one of the American military bases surrounding the Soviet Union into Soviet territory. This was done according to a deliberate plan and approved by the American president who talked so much about his so-called desire for peace and negotiation. After the criminals' embarrassing lies were exposed, world public opinion saw that the US government not only did not express any regret for this bizarre contribution to promoting the relaxation of international tensions, but also shamelessly boasted that it would organize espionage flights over the Soviet Union in a planned way, and that it would continue to systematically violate Soviet national sovereignty as an established long-term policy.

Faced with this kind of political banditry, how could the Soviet government maintain even the most basic trust in the United States? There is only one way out of this situation: the US government responsible for this expresses its apology, and solemnly guarantees that it will never stop this practice in the future. The report pointed out that because the US government stubbornly refused to take the steps necessary due to its aggressive actions, it bears full and major responsibility for obstructing and undermining the holding of the summit and failing the expectations of the people of all countries.

With a firm attitude, the Soviet government once again contributed to the cause of peace and the people, and at the same time exposed the two-faced approach of American imperialism.

The report said that the workers will remember this fact: these evil provocations by the US imperialists are not only an arrogant and intolerable challenge to the Soviet working class and people, but also a serious damage to the cause of peace and the interests of workers in all countries. Workers all over the world, while realizing through facts the close unity that unites them with the Soviet workers, trade unions and people, will understand the urgent necessity to maintain vigilance at all times and strengthen the struggle for peace.

The report solemnly stated that the World Federation of Trade Unions condemns the aggressive and hypocritical policies of the American militarist groups and Eisenhower and his government, who, under the guise of rhetoric, in fact pursue a policy of strength and a policy of "brinkmanship."

The report pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions exposed these conspiracies by the United States, carried out according to a whole set of established policies, against the relaxation of international tensions and world peace, with the following words at the Executive Committee meeting held in Bucharest last December: "...The Executive Committee draws the attention of workers and trade unions in all countries to the fact that although there have been changes in the international situation, powerful reactionary forces, especially arms trusts and militarist groups, have been opposing the easing of the international situation and the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries."

The report said that the World Federation of Trade Unions has in the past and still exposes the cold war and large-scale rearmament policy implemented by the Bonn government under the support of the ruling groups in the United States and other Western countries. Faced with the revival of West German militarism, we are satisfied to welcome the policy of the German Democratic Republic, the first peace-loving and democratic country in German history, which embodies the best traditions of the German people and has become a solid fortress of peace in Germany and Europe.

The report said that the US government, in disregard of the wishes of the Japanese people, workers and trade unions (we pay tribute to the outstanding struggle of the people, workers and trade unions of this country) signed a new US-Japan treaty with the Japanese militarists, which extends its military intervention to Southeast Asia and all the way to Soviet and Chinese territory.

American leaders undermine the Korean armistice agreement, disregard the uprising of the South Korean people, and continue to increase occupying forces and set up missiles and atomic weapons in this country.

While continuing to occupy Chinese territory Taiwan and subsidizing the ridiculous Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, they have stepped up military exercises and provocations in Chinese territorial waters.

This attitude and the open interference of the United States in South Vietnam and Laos are deeply disturbing to the masses of people and workers in Asia and around the world.

This poses a constant threat to the peace, security, and independence of Asian countries.

The report emphasized that the World Federation of Trade Unions, in the name of its 101 million members, protests these provocations.

It declares that for workers and people of all countries, there is only one people's and democratic China—it should exercise its full sovereignty over all parts of its territory. For all workers, there is only one Chinese government, which is supported by 650 million free people and is thriving, and it should be recognized by all Western governments. Without the participation of the Chinese government, no major outstanding international issues can be effectively resolved.

The report pointed out that the imperialist policy brought serious dangers, and also added the following attempts: to perpetuate or restore colonial control and racial oppression in rude and covert new forms.

Associated with these attempts are the French government's brutal colonial war imposed on the Algerian people, who are standing up and waging a historically heroic struggle for freedom, dignity and independence, and the atomic tests carried out in disregard of the unanimous protests of the people of all countries.

The report said that workers of all countries can note that on the day after the Camp David talks, when the Soviet Union took measures for partial demobilization and put 1.2 million people into peaceful production, the US government passed a more expanded military budget.

The Western government did not develop in the direction of taking demobilization measures as the socialist countries have done in recent years, and they are still continuing the arms race.

They undermined disarmament negotiations, while the US government openly announced its intention to resume nuclear weapons testing.

Therefore, it is clear that the US provocation on May 1 was by no means an isolated or unconsidered action, but an indivisible part of a whole set of established policies towards war preparations.

The report emphasized that imperialism, headed by US imperialism, exposed its face as an enemy of peace and the people of all countries. It remains the source of war.

The report said that the existence and all-round power of the world's peace forces, first of all the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, have proved to be effective in hindering these war attempts. If these forces always unite and act, they can defeat the war forces of imperialism.

The report then analyzed the objective and favorable conditions for strengthening the struggle of the working masses for peace.

The report pointed out that today the balance of power is definitely in favor of the world socialist and peace camp.

The Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp have achieved extraordinary development in science, economy and society. The report mentioned that when the Soviet government specified the plan for comprehensive and thorough disarmament submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on June 2, it now put forward a new disarmament plan. In this way, even though US imperialism undermined the summit, the Soviet Union once again demonstrated its unremitting efforts to relieve the disaster of atomic war. The World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that it can represent the feelings of workers all over the world, welcome the new steps taken by the Soviet government, and warmly support these new proposals.

At the same time, the new anti-imperialist and anti-colonial people's forces are increasingly consolidating the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.

The great anti-imperialist alliance of the people of all countries and all workers has increased by hundreds of millions of new troops, and can finally enthusiastically work for their progress, unity, and for safeguarding world peace.

Countries that have been liberated from colonialism and tyranny are creating new and significant experiences, and the trade union movement is making special contributions to them.

The upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle has broken through the political and geographical scope of old colonialism, and is disrupting international political conditions at a speed that the Western governments can't keep up with.

The World Federation of Trade Unions, with a joyful heart, together with all peace and progressive forces, has in the past and now welcomes the great victories that have been achieved, especially the great victories achieved by the African people, and welcomes the decisive role played by the trade unions and workers in this march towards independence.

Finally, the upsurge of the struggle of workers in capitalist countries itself, and the important role played by workers and trade unions in defending peace, also weaken imperialism and create favorable conditions for isolating imperialism.

The report pointed out that in Latin America, recent years have been characterized by a new upsurge in the people's struggle against monopoly capital and against the economic and political control of American imperialism, and a new victory in the struggle against the bloody dictatorial regimes supported and fostered by American imperialism. In this regard, the democratic and people's revolution in Cuba demonstrated the real possibility of defeating imperialism. The development of the democratic struggle in Venezuela and the experience of the powerful mass movement in Argentina show the importance of the struggle of the Latin American people to fundamentally change the situation. While warmly saluting all the workers in Latin America, the report calls on workers and trade unions all over the world to more vigorously support the exemplary struggle of the Cuban brothers to defeat the constant provocations of North American monopoly capital.

The report said that in the same spirit, we once again express the World Federation of Trade Unions' deep support for the workers and people of South Korea, who, after heavy sacrifices, recently overthrew the government supported by the American occupation forces in the name of Western democracy. The report demands the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the cessation of their interference in the internal affairs of Korea.

The report pointed out that after Batista, Syngman Rhee and Menderes also stepped down one after another; Washington's puppets collapsed one after another in the face of popular anger. In this way, in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the democratic masks that the US imperialists tried to wear have been exposed day by day.

The report talked about the impact of all these changes on the trade union movement.

First of all, the influence of the scientific achievements and the economic and social realities and prospects of the socialist camp, as well as the initial progress achieved on the road to easing international tensions, has begun to free many workers who do not join the World Federation of Trade Unions from the control of anti-communist propaganda, as some people have tried to trap them in narrow economism.

The victories achieved by the oppressed people in their struggle against imperialism and for democracy have had a direct and very favorable impact on trade unions. As a natural result of their active participation in this struggle, workers have been able to get rid of the bad elements in the trade union movement who colluded with tyranny and imperialism, and get rid of those who most enthusiastically supported the Cold War in the trade union movement. For example, after the victory of the revolution, Cuban workers cleared out the old trade union leaders gathered around Mujal and Batista, and withdrew from the "Free Trade Union." Similarly, through the heroic struggle of the South Korean workers and people who overthrew Syngman Rhee, the South Korean workers got rid of the old trade union leaders who were discredited for colluding with American imperialism and the dictatorial regime. These old leaders sat with Chiang Kai-shek's trade union puppets in the leadership of the "Free Trade Union."

The report said that, as our Fourth Congress has made it clear, the imperialists have not abandoned their plans to prepare and launch a new world war, and they are still deaf to the demands of the people of all countries to reduce war budgets, stop atomic tests, and ban the manufacture and use of thermonuclear weapons; in the face of such facts, it is essential to strengthen the unified action of workers and trade unions around the world to defend peace.

The report believes that the struggle for peace remains the fundamental task of the trade union movement. In order to make a decisive change in the international situation, to a large extent, it depends on all of us in the trade union movement, on the united struggle of the working masses, and on their cooperation with all people's strata who are ready to take action in this regard.

The report also believes that we should be good at pointing out to the workers in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas that the economic and social competition between the capitalist system and the socialist system, the development of international trade, turning military budgets into welfare for the working masses, and providing unconditional economic and technical assistance to economically backward countries can only bring universal progress to all people without exception.

Then, the report said, of course, economic assistance to backward countries cannot be carried out in the form conceived by the imperialists. Indeed, everyone knows that the imperialists only try to maintain their rule under the cover of economic assistance, and to obtain high profits by exploiting the people of all countries they claim to be assisting.

The report then analyzed the evolution of the current international economic situation.

The report pointed out that the characteristics of this situation are the deepening of the general crisis of the capitalist system. After experiencing a crisis in 1958, the United States and the United Kingdom saw a slight increase in the production index in 1959. However, at the end of 1959, unutilized production capacity in the United States reached 10% to 15%, the United Kingdom 5% to 10%, and Sweden more than 5%. Some production sectors are in very serious stagnation with no hope of resolution. If we compare this development of capitalist countries with the extraordinary speed of socialist economic development, then the embarrassing ugliness of the capitalist system is manifested in facts with particularly great persuasiveness. Just to cite two sets of figures: from 1953 to 1959, the total industrial production of the Soviet Union increased by 90%, while the United States only increased by 11%; if calculated per capita, the Soviet Union increased by 71%, while the United States only increased by 0.3%. From 1957 to 1958, the average increase in industrial production in eleven socialist countries was 26%.

Along with this relative weakening, capitalist monopoly capital has further accelerated their concentration process in this recent period, strengthened the exploitation of workers, and implemented militarization of the national economy.

The report pointed out that this general evolution has had a particularly disastrous impact on many economically underdeveloped countries that are linked to the world capitalist economy. All Asian and Latin American countries bound by American military obligations have had to spend most of their meager budgets and borrowed dollars on huge military expenditures, which have sapped their economies, deepened their backwardness, and further aggravated the poverty of the masses.

After winning major victories in the political struggle for independence, most of these countries should wage a stubborn struggle to achieve economic independence and get rid of the conspiracy of neo-colonialism, which, under the cover of various forms of assistance, attempts to maintain and strengthen the control of monopoly capital.

The report said that workers and people in underdeveloped countries can recognize the fundamental difference between the so-called assistance of these imperialist countries and the fraternal and selfless assistance of socialist countries to them in economic, technical, and financial terms. This assistance fully respects the independence of these countries and guarantees their economic development.

The report cited the example of the revolutionary government of Cuba, saying that the Cuban authorities, relying on the working people and the working class, confiscated American trusts, distributed land to farmers, and changed single-crop farming to diversified farming. At the same time, a series of measures were taken to promote the cooperative movement, increase agricultural production, and improve the housing, labor, and living conditions of farmers. This is a valuable inspiration for countries facing the same problem of having to achieve economic independence.

The report described the situation of workers in capitalist countries under these circumstances.

The report said that under more refined and more concealed methods of exploitation, workers in capitalist countries pay more and more creative labor, but what they get is less and less compared with the degree of their physical premature aging and the needs of life. Although wages have increased somewhat in recent years in places where workers have strengthened their struggles, the prices of consumer goods in many countries have also risen. At the same time, millions of various workers, young workers, temporary workers, agricultural workers, and black Americans in capitalist countries continue to suffer discrimination in wages. In most capitalist countries, women's wages continue to suffer from shameful discrimination. Workers are not only directly exploited in the workplace, but are also forced to give part of their meager purchasing power to the bourgeois state in the form of taxes, and this part is increasing day by day. In 1959, the taxes of the United States, Britain, and France combined increased nine times compared with 1939. In capitalist countries, there is widespread large-scale and long-term unemployment. Some people call this phenomenon "developing unemployment." In the United States alone, there are 4.1 million "officially" unemployed workers (accounting for 5.2% of the labor force). The number of work-related accidents and occupational diseases remains high and is dangerously deteriorating. Capitalists put the concept of profit above worker safety. In order to evade responsibility, they often refuse to recognize work-related accidents and occupational diseases.

The report further pointed out that in order to facilitate and ensure their exploitation and promote economic militarization, monopoly capital and governments that serve monopoly capital have launched a particularly large-scale attack on democratic freedoms and workers' trade union rights in recent years. In many capitalist countries, a large number of trade union leaders and trade union cadres have been subjected to particularly brutal repression. Striking workers often face violent repression, including legal prohibitions, mass arrests, court convictions, and imprisonment. The new Landrum-Griffin anti-union law recently passed in the United States is a typical example. This law further strengthens the arsenal of anti-worker laws in the United States, stipulating that the Secretary of Labor can interfere in trade union activities, forcing trade unions to report administrative and financial information to government representatives regularly, and simply prohibiting certain forms of strikes and struggle solidarity, otherwise severe penalties will be imposed.

The report pointed out that in order to express their dissatisfaction with their situation, to oppose the more intense exploitation by monopoly capital, and to deal with the attacks on the rights they have won at great cost, workers in capitalist countries have launched a movement of struggle on a particularly large scale in the past three years.

A series of figures cited in the report show that in recent years, especially in 1959, there has been a significant increase in the number of workers participating in strikes in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, various Latin American countries, India, and Japan. The current strike movement in the United States can be regarded as the most significant counterattack of the American workers' movement after the war. The number of strikers increased from 1.39 million in 1957 to 1.895 million in 1959. The officially announced lost workdays increased from 16.5 million in 1957 to 23.2 million in 1958 and 68.5 million in 1959, almost quadrupling in two years. This means that each worker participating in the strike movement during 1958 was out of work for an average of 36 days. This length is the highest record in the last 25 years. The 116-day great struggle of American steelworkers is one of the most resounding examples.

The report proudly paid tribute to these millions of brothers and sisters from all five continents belonging to various trade union organizations, who so bravely showed their unwillingness to endure the fate of the exploited, and raised the banner of unity and solidarity of the working class in front of the class enemy, thereby comprehensively weakening world monopoly capital.

The report said that in the past three years, the united action of the working class has been consolidated in the flames of class struggle. Due to facing monopoly capital, the tendency of trade union organization to unify is also strengthening. Trade unions in Africa and Latin America are seeking a pan-continental path of unity on the basis of class struggle and anti-imperialist struggle. In Europe, due to the initial implementation of the "Common Market," workers in various European countries are increasingly clearly aware in their struggle that joint action must be taken between trade unions to oppose the monopoly capital of the "Common Market." In this regard, the position of some trade union leading bodies under the "Free Trade Union" in persisting in opposing unity obviously hindered some struggles and limited some achievements. The World Federation of Trade Unions has done everything in its power to provide international support for the large-scale struggle of the working class against monopoly capital in the industrial sector and in international institutions, and effectively helped them achieve victory.

The report then talked about the necessity of summarizing a common program of economic and social demands from the entire workers' struggle, and carrying out united action with this program as a starting point.

The report said that these demands are first of all to fully increase wages, allowances, and pensions, increase the fixed part of wages, and stop discrimination in wages between male and female workers. Secondly, it is about protecting workers from the negative consequences of mechanization and automation in the capitalist economy, especially against unemployment. It demands shortening working hours without reducing wages, especially implementing a 40-hour work week in Western Europe, and increasing the amount and payment period of unemployment benefits. The report emphasized that defending the right to strike is a particularly important issue in the current situation. In addition, it is also necessary to defend and improve social insurance.

The report said that in order to help promote the united action of workers and cooperation between trade union organizations, the World Federation of Trade Unions put forward the following suggestions to all trade union organizations:

1. Hold a European Trade Union Conference at the beginning of 1961 to fight for a forty-hour work week without reducing wages.
2. Establish an "International Trade Union Committee" composed of trade union workers and legal workers to promote and organize the defense of trade union rights and the defense of victims suffering from anti-union repression.
3. Establish a broad international trade union action committee to fight for social security, in order to ensure the united action and new development of international solidarity in the struggle to achieve this goal.

The report then talked about the creative struggle of workers in socialist countries, which account for one-third of the world's population.

The report said that the great achievements of the Soviet Union in launching artificial satellites and space rockets, the achievements of the Seven-Year Plan, the amazing Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people, and the progress of the entire socialist camp have greatly pleased all workers in capitalist countries who are engaged in the daily battle against exploitation.

The report said that the driving force behind this historical transformation under the socialist banner that we see today is the conscious and creative struggle of hundreds of millions of men and women to infinitely improve their lives and strive for prosperity. It is carried out in a society without exploiters and exploited. In this society, the fruits of labor throughout the country directly or indirectly belong to the laborers, and workers personally experience the link between labor efforts and meeting their economic and social needs in their daily experience.

The working masses are increasingly clearly seeing that behind every artificial satellite, behind the amazing production speed of the Seven-Year Plan, behind the great goals of the economic plans of the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, in the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, behind the miraculous development, lies the inexhaustible and irreplaceable creative initiative of the masses of people who have been freed from exploitation. It is this creative initiative that will enable the entire socialist system to create half of the world's total industrial output in 1965.

The report pointed out that under the socialist system, workers participate in socialist competitions on a large scale. In the past two years, in the Soviet Union and several other countries, this competition has taken on new and higher forms of communist and socialist labor shock brigades. This competition has achieved outstanding results, and the initial achievements prove that the goals of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule, and the prescribed targets will be greatly exceeded.

In China, hundreds of millions of urban and rural laborers have spontaneously created and worked enthusiastically, achieving a comprehensive leap forward. This leap forward has completely freed them from long-term economic backwardness and brought them closer to their basic goal of building China into a great industrial and agricultural power. Due to the mobilization of the masses, industrial output value increased by 39.3% in 1958 alone, and national income increased by 21.6% from 1958 to 1959, enabling the Five-Year Plan to be realized three years ahead of schedule.

The report said that while developing production normally, socialist countries are expanding their ranks of workers every year.

Workers in socialist countries have been freed from unemployment forever. They are fighting to further and rapidly increase labor productivity. In addition, in recent years, workers in socialist countries have more closely participated in the actual management of the socialist economy and enterprises, and further brought their initiative into play.

The report emphasized that in recent years, whenever workers in capitalist countries see the great goals set by workers in socialist countries, especially the indicators of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, they are greatly encouraged.

The report said that the bright prospects and the great achievements already achieved in socialist countries inspire and encourage the struggle of the working class in the capitalist world.

The report then talked about the participation of trade union organizations in the struggle to defend peace. It pointed out that according to the development of the international situation, the issue of defending world peace occupies an increasingly important position in the minds and activities of trade union organizations and the working masses.

Therefore, the relationship between economic struggles and the struggle to defend peace in the trade union movement is becoming closer and closer. The working masses have found a variety of ways to rise up and defend peace in united action.

In some countries, such as Japan and Britain, powerful mass demonstrations, nationwide movements, or marches against foreign nuclear bases and demanding an end to nuclear testing are held almost every year.

Sometimes workers also take more direct action. The heroic Yokohama dockworkers, with the support of people from all walks of life and international support, refused to unload foreign missiles.

At this moment, more than four million Japanese workers, closely united with the broadest masses of the people, are opposing Japanese militarists and US imperialists with unprecedented momentum, and striving to abolish the US-Japan military treaty. The council will definitely express warm support for the exemplary struggle of the Japanese workers and trade unions to repel the forces of war.

The French government's disregard for the unanimous opposition of French workers to conducting nuclear tests in the Sahara has aroused waves of anger and protest from the African people and trade union organizations.

African trade union organizations stood at the forefront of the movement, providing valuable assistance to the French workers' struggle against the nuclear arms race and the actions of the working class all over the world demanding a ban on testing.

Australia, Canada, and Latin America have organized signature campaigns and weeks of action to demand a ban on nuclear testing and oppose Germany's nuclear armament.

The report pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions has not relaxed its efforts in this regard in the past and now. Aiming at the waiting attitude of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the Catholic Trade Union, which rely on bourgeois governments and international organizations and do not call on the working masses to struggle, the World Federation of Trade Unions has promoted and guided the united action and mutual support of workers in this struggle, and has strived to improve the cooperation between trade union organizations and other non-trade union forces that take action in the same direction.

The report said when talking about the common program for defending peace, that as we have already seen, although the provocations and conspiracies of the US imperialists have obstructed the holding of the summit, the objective conditions favorable to the forces of peace have not changed due to recent events.

On the contrary, it can be said that these conditions have been strengthened. The deceptive tactics and aggressive policies of US imperialism have been exposed to the people and workers of all countries.

However, the forces of peace must achieve their goal of establishing lasting peace in the world through increasingly strong and united constant struggles.

It is now possible for the trade union forces to effectively cooperate in the struggle for peace. It is possible and necessary to call on workers and trade union organizations to carry out struggles to:

——Ease the international situation and achieve peaceful coexistence;
——Achieve comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and immediately reduce war budgets and taxes;
——Stop and ban nuclear testing;
——Safeguard the national sovereignty of all countries;
——Realize the independence of the people of all countries, end the war in Algeria by faithfully implementing the right of self-determination of the Algerian people and by holding talks with the Algerian Provisional Government;
——Eliminate German militarism;
——Conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys and resolve the West Berlin issue;
——Abolish the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

In addition, recent events have made it clearer than ever that workers and people in all countries demand the need to abolish the military bases of the United States and other imperialist countries on foreign territories.

The report emphasized that the strength of the workers lies in their consistent struggle. It said that we can see that in order to move forward, the entire trade union movement is once again facing the key issue of decisively strengthening the united action between all workers and trade union organizations at all levels and the solidarity of the international working class.

Undoubtedly, we have already seen throughout the report that along this road, we have made progress in action, in economic struggles, in the struggle for peace, and in the struggle for national independence.

The solidarity of the international working class is developing, and the contacts and exchanges of delegations between trade union organizations that were isolated from each other in the past have also developed.

Defending peace, demanding a stop to nuclear testing, and striving for genuine, comprehensive and thorough disarmament will be arduous and long-term struggles.

In order to carry out this struggle well, the cooperation between all trade union organizations, the united action at the domestic and international levels, and close mutual support have obviously become urgent and necessary.

The struggle against colonialism and to defend the independence of the people of all countries has reached a decisive stage.

The summary of the workers' struggles that we have described above allows people to anticipate that in capitalist countries, we are facing an intensification of class conflict.

If all national and international trade unions coordinate their actions to oppose the alliance and concentration of monopoly capital, significant achievements can be made. When imperialism tries its best to use conspiracies and provocations to delay the pace of workers and people of all countries towards lasting peace, the elimination of colonialism, and the phenomenon of man exploiting man, workers all over the world will strengthen the indestructible ties of international class solidarity to overcome all obstacles.

    国际局势的发展以及工会运动当前的活动和任务
    世界工联第十一次理事会会议（1960年6月5日于北京）第一项议程报告（摘要）
    世界工联总书记路易·赛扬
    在6月5日开幕的世界工联第十一次理事会会议上，世界工联书记处书记马赛尔·布拉代表世界工联总书记路易·赛扬作了会议第一项议程报告。
    报告在开始时说，自从世界工联成立以来，我们今天第一次在光荣的中华人民共和国首都召开理事会。他借此机会，向中国工人和中国工会致以特别热烈的敬礼。
    报告首先回顾了1957年世界工会第四次代表大会召开以来国际局势的发展。
    报告说，自从我们世界工会第四次代表大会召开以来，三年已经过去了。这三年的特点是社会主义阵营和所有和平力量所取得的显著成就和进行的不懈努力，也是各帝国主义集团为了阻挠达成和平共处所进行的各种阴谋活动。
    仅仅三年，但是充满了使人民的希望和警惕性遭受到严重考验的事件。
    报告指出，在巴黎最高级会议召开的几天之前，美国国务院从包围着苏联的美国军事基地之一派遣了一架军用间谍飞机进入苏联领土上空。而这是根据深思熟虑的计划，并经这位大谈他所谓的和平与协商愿望的美国总统批准而进行的。在罪犯们的窘困的谎言被揭穿之后，世界公众舆论看到美国政府对于这种促进国际紧张局势缓和的古怪贡献不但毫不表示任何遗憾，而且无耻地吹嘘要把有计划地组织在苏联上空进行间谍飞行，以及要把继续有计划地侵犯苏联国家主权当作一项既定的长期政策。
    面对着这种政治强盗手段，苏联政府如何能够对美国保持最起码的信任呢？对此形势只有一个出路：对此负责的美国政府表示道歉，同时庄严地保证今后永远停止这种做法。报告指出，由于美国政府顽固地拒绝采取由于它的侵略行动而成为必要采取的步骤，它就对阻挠和破坏最高级会议的召开和辜负各国人民的期待承担完全的和重大的责任。
    苏联政府以坚决的态度又一次对和平与人民的事业作出了贡献，同时也揭露了美国帝国主义的两面手法。
    报告说，工人们将记住这一事实：美帝国主义者的这些罪恶挑衅行为不仅是对苏联工人阶级和人民一次狂妄的和不可容忍的挑战，而且也是对和平事业和各国工人利益的严重损害。全世界工人们在通过事实体会到把他们与苏联工人、工会和人民联结在一起的紧密团结的同时，将了解必须时刻保持警惕，并加强争取和平的斗争的迫切的必要性。
    报告严正表示，世界工联谴责美国军国主义集团和艾森豪威尔及其政府的侵略和伪善的政策，他们在花言巧语的掩盖之下事实上奉行着实力政策和“边缘”政策。
    报告指出，世界工联已于去年12月在布加勒斯特召开的执委会上用以下的话揭露了美国根据一整套既定政策而进行的这些反对国际局势缓和和世界和平的阴谋：“……执委会提请各国工人和工会注意这样的事实：虽然国际局势有了变化，但是强大的反动势力，特别是军火托拉斯和军国主义集团一直在反对国际局势的和缓和各国人民的和平愿望。”
    报告说，世界工联过去和现在都揭露在美国和其他西方国家的统治集团扶植之下波恩政府所执行的冷战与大规模重新武装的政策。面对着西德军国主义的复活，我们满意地欢迎德意志民主共和国的政策，这是德国历史上第一个爱好和平和民主的国家，它体现着德国人民的最优秀的传统并在德国和欧洲成为一个坚固的和平堡垒。
    报告说，美国政府悍然不顾日本人民、工人和工会的意愿（我们向这个国家人民、工人和工会所进行的出色的斗争致敬）与日本军国主义者签订了新的日美条约，这个条约把它的军事干涉范围伸展到东南亚并一直达到苏联和中国领土。
    美国的领导人破坏朝鲜的停战协定，不顾南朝鲜人民的起义，在这个国家的领土上，继续增加占领军，并设置导弹和原子武器。
    在继续占领中国领土台湾并津贴可笑的蒋介石傀儡政权的同时，他们加紧在中国领海的军事演习和挑衅。
    这种态度以及美国对南越和老挝公开的干涉使亚洲和全世界的人民群众和工人们深感不安。
    这对亚洲国家的和平、安全、与独立成为一种经常的威胁。
    报告强调说，世界工联以它的一亿零一百万会员的名义抗议这些蠢动。
    它宣称对各国工人和人民来说，只有一个人民的和民主的中国——它应该在它领土的所有部分行使自己的全部主权。对所有的工人来说，只有一个中国政府，这个政府受到六亿五千万自由人民的支持，正在蓬勃发展，它应该为所有的西方政府所承认。没有中国政府的参加，任何悬而未决的重大国际问题都不可能得到有效的解决。
    报告指出，帝国主义的政策带来了严重的危险，同时还要加上下列各种企图：在粗暴的和隐蔽的新的形式下永远进行或重新恢复殖民主义控制和种族压迫。
    与这些企图联系在一起的是法国政府强加在站起来为争取自由、尊严和独立而进行历史性英勇的斗争的阿尔及利亚人民头上的残酷的殖民主义战争，和不顾各国人民一致的抗议而进行的原子试验。
    报告说，各国工人们能够注意到在戴维营谈判的翌日，当苏联采取部分复员的措施，将一百二十万人投入和平生产的时候，美国政府却通过了更加扩大的军事预算。
  西方政府不但不向采取的复员措施的方向发展如像社会主义国家近几年来所做的那样，并且还在继续进行军备竞赛。
    他们破坏裁军谈判，同时美国政府公开宣布恢复核武器试验的意图。
    因而显然，美国5月1日的挑衅决不是孤立或未经考虑的行动，而是朝向战争准备的一整套既定政策的不可分割的一部分。
    报告强调指出，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义暴露了它是和平和各国人民的敌人的面目。它依然是战争的根源。
    报告说，事实证明世界的和平力量、首先苏联和社会主义国家的存在和在各方面的威力，有效地阻碍着这些战争的企图。假使这些力量始终团结起来行动，它们能够击败帝国主义的战争势力。
    报告接着分析了加强工人群众争取和平的斗争的客观有利条件。
    报告指出，今天力量的对比肯定地有利于世界社会主义与和平阵营。
    苏联和整个社会主义阵营在科学、经济和社会方面取得了非凡的发展。报告谈到，苏联政府6月2日在具体说明向联合国大会提出的全面和彻底裁军计划时，它现在又提出了新的裁军方案。这样，尽管美帝国主义破坏了最高级会议，苏联又一次表现出它为解除原子战争灾难的不懈努力。世界工联确信能够代表全世界工人的感情，对苏联政府的新步骤表示欢迎，并热烈支持这些新的建议。
    同时，新的反帝反殖民主义的人民力量，日益巩固着各国人民争取和平的斗争。
    各国人民和全体工人的伟大的反帝联盟增加了亿万的生力军，终于能够热情地为他们的进步、团结和为维护世界和平作出贡献而努力。
    已经从殖民主义和暴政下解放出来的国家正创造着新的和具有重大意义的经验，而工会运动在其中作出特殊的贡献。
    反殖民主义斗争的高涨冲破了老殖民主义的政治和地理范围，而且以一种西方政府喘息不及的速度打乱着国际政治条件。
    世界工联以欢乐的心情同一切和平与进步力量一起，过去和现在都对已经取得的巨大胜利特别是非洲人民所获得的巨大胜利表示欢迎，对工会和工人在这个走向独立的进军中所起的决定性作用表示欢迎。
    最后，资本主义国家工人的斗争的高涨本身，以及工人和工会在捍卫和平中所起的重要作用，也同样削弱着帝国主义并创造着使帝国主义孤立的有利条件。
    报告指出，在拉丁美洲，近年来的特点是人民反对垄断资本，反对美国帝国主义经济和政治控制的斗争的新高涨，以及反对美帝国主义所支持和豢养的血腥独裁政权斗争的新胜利。在这方面，古巴的民主和人民的革命表现出击败帝国主义的现实可能性。委内瑞拉民主斗争的发展和阿根廷的强大群众运动的这种经验，显示出拉丁美洲人民为争取根本改变局势的斗争的重要性。报告在向拉丁美洲全体工人热烈致敬的同时，号召全世界工人和工会更有力地支援古巴兄弟为击败北美垄断资本的不断挑衅而进行的模范的斗争。
    报告说，在同一种精神下，我们再一次向南朝鲜的工人和人民表示世界工联对他们的深切支援，他们经过沉重的牺牲，不久前打倒了美国占领军以西方民主名义扶植的政府。报告要求从南朝鲜撤退美国军队，停止他们对朝鲜内部事务的干涉。
    报告指出，在巴蒂斯塔之后，李承晚和曼德列斯也相继下台了；华盛顿的傀儡，一个接一个地在人民愤怒下土崩瓦解。这样，在亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲，美帝国主义者所企图戴上的民主面具一天天遭到了揭露。
    报告谈到了所有这些变化对于工会运动所发生的影响。
    首先，社会主义阵营的科学成就和经济社会方面的现实和远景的影响，以及在缓和国际局势的道路上所实现的初步的进展，开始使许多不加入世界工联的工人摆脱反共宣传的控制，如有人企图使他们陷入的狭隘经济主义的控制。
    被压迫人民反对帝国主义和争取民主的斗争所取得的胜利在工会方面产生了直接和很有利的影响。做为他们积极参预这个斗争的必然结果，工人们得以摆脱了那些与暴政和帝国主义相勾结的工会运动中的坏分子们，摆脱了工会运动中最热烈支持冷战的那些人物。例如古巴工人在革命胜利之后清除了聚集在穆哈尔和巴蒂斯塔周围的旧的工会领导，并且退出了“自由工联”。同样，通过推翻了李承晚的南朝鲜工人和人民的英勇斗争，南朝鲜工人摆脱了由于与美帝国主义和独裁政权勾结而声名败坏的旧工会领导。这些旧领导在“自由工联”领导机构中是与蒋介石的工会傀儡坐在一边的。
    报告说，正如我们第四次代表大会已经明确提出，帝国主义者还没有放弃它们准备和发动一次新的世界大战的计划，它们依然对各国人民要求缩减战争预算、停止原子试验、禁止制造和使用热核武器等等要求充耳不闻；面对着这样的事实，加强全世界工人和工会为保卫和平的统一行动，是必不可少的。
    报告认为，争取和平的斗争依然是工会运动的根本任务。为了使国际局势获得具有决定意义的改变，在很大成分上，要在工会运动中依靠我们全体，依靠劳动群众的统一斗争，依靠他们和一切准备在这方面行动的人民阶层的合作。
    报告还这样认为，我们应该善于向亚、非、欧、美的工人们指出，资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的经济和社会竞赛，国际贸易的发展，把军备预算变为劳动群众谋福利，以及对经济落后国家给予无条件的经济和技术援助，无例外的对全体人民来说，只能带来普遍进步。
    然后，报告说，当然，对落后国家的经济援助不能在帝国主义者所设想的形式下进行。的确，大家都知道，帝国主义者只要在经济援助的掩盖之下企图维持其统治，和通过剥削他们声称要援助的各国人民来取得高额的利润。
    报告接着分析了目前国际经济形势的演变。
    报告指出，这种形势的特点是资本主义制度总危机的深刻化。美国和英国在1958年经历了一次危机后，在1959年生产指数稍为有点上升。但是在1959年底，没有被利用的生产能力在美国达10％到15％，英国
  5％到10％，瑞典5％以上。有些生产部门非常严重的停滞着，毫无解决的希望。如果我们把资本主义国家这种发展情况同社会主义经济发展的非凡速度来比较，那么资本主义制度的喘气不及的丑态就以特别巨大的说服力从事实中表现出来。只举两系列的数字：从1953到1959年，苏联的全部工业生产增加了90％，而美国只增加11％；如果按人口平均计算，苏联增加71％，美国只有0．3％。从1957到1958年，十一个社会主义国家工业生产平均增加26％。
    随着这个相对的削弱而来的，资本主义垄断资本在最近这个时期中进一步加速了它们的集中过程，加强了对工人的剥削，并且实行国民经济军事化。
    报告指出，这种总的演变情况，对许多与世界资本主义经济有联系的、经济不发达的国家特别产生灾难性的影响。受到美国军事公约束缚的所有亚洲和拉丁美洲国家，不得不把他们的微薄的预算和借来的美元的大部分用于庞大的军事支出，这种庞大的军事支出，使他们经济丧失元气，加深了它的落后状态，并使群众的贫困进一步恶化。
    这些国家中的大多数在政治上争取独立斗争取得重大胜利以后，应该进行顽强的斗争来争取经济上的独立，并摆脱新殖民主义的阴谋，新殖民主义在各种各样的援助形式掩护下，企图保持和加强垄断资本的控制。
    报告说，不发达国家的工人和人民能够认识到这种帝国主义国家的所谓援助和社会主义国家对他们在经济、技术和财政方面的兄弟般的无私的援助之间的根本区别。这种援助充分尊重这些国家的独立并保证它们的经济发展。
    报告举古巴革命政府为例说，古巴当局依靠劳动人民和工人阶级没收了美国的托拉斯，把土地分给了农民，并把单一耕作变为多种耕作。同时采取了一系列措施来促进合作社运动，提高农业生产、改善农民的住房、劳动和生活条件。对面临必须取得经济独立相同问题的国家来说，这是一个富有价值的鼓舞。
    报告叙述了在这种情况下资本主义国家工人的处境。
    报告说，在更细致和更隐蔽的剥削方式下，资本主义国家的工人们付出越来越多的创造性的劳动力，而所得的与他们的身体早衰程度和人生需要相比却越来越少。虽然在最近几年中，在工人们加强了斗争的地方，工资有了某些增加，但许多国家的消费品价格也都上涨了。同时，资本主义国家数以百万计的各种工人、青工、临时工、农业工人、美国黑人，继续在工资方面遭受歧视。在大多数资本主义国家中，妇女的工资仍然遭受着可耻的歧视。工人不但在工作场所受到直接剥削，而且被迫以捐税形式把他的微薄的购买力的一部分让给资产阶级国家，而这一部分正在日益增长。1959年美、英、法三国加起来的捐税与1939年相比提高了九倍。在资本主义国家里，普遍存在着大规模和长期持续的失业现象。有人把这种现象称之为“发展中的失业”。仅美国就有四百一十万“正式的”失业工人（占劳动力的5．2％）。工伤事故和职业病的数字仍然很高，并且正在危险地恶化。资本家把利润的概念放在工人安全之上。他们为了逃避责任，经常拒绝承认工伤事故和职业病。
    报告进一步指出，垄断资本和为垄断资本服务的政府，为了便利和保障它们的剥削和促进经济军事化，在最近几年中对民主自由和工人工会权利，展开了特大规模的进攻。在很多资本主义国家，一大批工会领袖和工会干部受到了特别残酷的镇压。罢工的工人们，时常面临暴力的镇压，包括法律上的禁止，大规模逮捕，法庭判罪和关进监狱。美国最近通过的新的兰德伦—格里芬反工会法，就是一个典型的例子。这条法律进一步加强了美国反工人法令武器库，它规定劳动部长可以干涉工会活动，迫使工会必须定期向政府代表报告行政和财政情况，干脆的禁止某些形式的罢工和斗争声援，否则就要给以严重的处罚。
    报告指出，资本主义国家的工人们为了对他们所处的地位表示不满，为了反对垄断资本更强烈的剥削，为了对付对他们曾花出重大代价而争取得来的权利的进攻，在最近三年中发动了一个具有特大规模的斗争运动。
    报告列举的一系列数字表明，美国、英国、法国、意大利、荷兰、拉丁美洲各国、印度、日本等资本主义国家近年来特别是1959年参加罢工的工人人数有了显著增长。在美国，目前正在进行的罢工运动可以看作是战后美国工人运动最有意义的反攻。罢工人数从1957年的一百三十九万人增加到1959年的一百八十九万五千人。官方公布的损失的工作日1957年为一千六百五十万，1958年增加为二千三百二十万，1959年增加为六千八百五十万，在二年中差不多增加了四倍。这意味着1958年期间参加罢工运动的每一个工人平均停工了三十六天。这样的长度是最近二十五年中最高的纪录。美国钢铁工人一百一十六天的大斗争就是其中最响亮的例子之一。
    报告引以自豪地表示向五大洲属于各种工会组织的这些千百万兄弟姊妹们致敬，他们这样英勇地显示不愿忍受被剥削者的命运，他们在阶级敌人面前高举了工人阶级统一团结的旗帜，从而全面削弱了世界垄断资本。
    报告说，三年来，在阶级斗争的火焰中，工人阶级的统一行动有了巩固。由于面对着垄断资本，工会组织上统一的倾向也在加强。非洲、拉丁美洲国家的工会，正在阶级斗争和反帝斗争的基础上，寻找一条全洲性的联合的道路。在欧洲，由于“共同市场”的初步实施，欧洲各国工人们在斗争中愈来愈清楚地认识到各工会之间必须采取联合行动来反对“共同市场”的垄断资本。在这方面，“自由工联”下面的某些工会领导机关的坚持反对统一的立场，显然妨碍了某些斗争，限制了某些成就。而世界工联却尽了一切力量在产业范围以及在国际机构中，对工人阶级所进行的反对垄断资本的大规模斗争开展国际支援，并有效地帮助他们取得胜利。
    报告接着谈到有必要从整个工人斗争中总结出一个经济社会方面的共同要求纲领，以这个纲领作出发点开展统一行动。
    报告说，这些要求，首先是充分增加工资、津贴和退休金，增加工资的固定部分，停止对男女工人工资方面的歧视。其次是关于保护工人防止资本主义经济中机械化和自动化的消极后果，特别是反对失业。要求缩短工作时间而不减低工资，特别是在西欧实行每周四十小时工作制，并且增加失业津贴的金额和支付期限。报告强调说，保卫罢工权利在现在情势下，是一个特别重要的问题。此外，还要保卫和改善社会保险。
    报告说，为了帮助促进工人们的统一行动和工会组织之间的合作，世界工联向一切工会组织提出下列建议：
    1、1961年初召开欧洲工会会议，争取四十小时工作制，而不减少工资。
  2、成立一个“国际工会委员会”，由工会工作者和法律工作者组成，以便推动和组织保卫工会权利和保卫遭受反工会镇压的受害者。
    3、成立一个争取社会安全的广泛的国际工会行动委员会，以便保证争取实现这一目标的统一行动和国际团结的新的发展。
    报告接着谈到占世界三分之一人口的社会主义国家工人们的创造性斗争的情况。
    报告说，苏联发射人造卫星、宇宙火箭的丰功伟绩、七年计划的成就和中国人民的惊人的大跃进以及全体社会主义阵营的进步，使在资本主义国家里进行着反剥削的日常战斗的所有工人都感到十分欢欣鼓舞。
    报告说，我们今天所看到的这种社会主义旗帜下的历史性变革的动力，就是亿万男女为了无限的改善生活、争取富裕而进行的自觉和创造性的斗争。它是在没有剥削者与被剥削者的社会中进行的。在这个社会中，全国的劳动果实直接或间接都归劳动者所有，工人们在他们的日常经验中亲身体验出劳动方面的努力与满足自己的经济社会需要之间的联系。
    劳动群众日益清楚地看到在每一个人造卫星后面，在七年计划惊人的生产速度后面，在德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚的经济计划的伟大目标后面，在中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国，奇迹般的发展后面存在着摆脱了剥削的人民群众的取之不尽、用之不竭的和不可代替的创造性的主动精神。就是这种创造性的主动精神将使整个社会主义体系有可能在1965年创造整个世界工业生产量的一半。
    报告指出，在社会主义制度下，工人们大规模参加社会主义竞赛。最近两年中，在苏联和其它好几个国家中，这种竞赛采取着共产主义和社会主义劳动突击队的新的和更高的形式。这种竞赛已获得了出色的成绩，初步成就证明，苏联七年计划的目标将提前完成，所规定的指标将大大超过。
    在中国，亿万城乡劳动者主动创造精神和热情劳动，实现了全面的跃进。这种跃进使他们彻底摆脱长期来的经济落后状态，并使他们接近他们自己的基本目标，把中国建设成为一个伟大的工农业强国。由于发动了群众，工业产值在1958年一年中提高了39．3％，而国民收入从1958年到1959年增加了21．6％，并使五年计划已经提前三年实现。
    报告说，社会主义国家在正常发展生产的同时，每年都在扩大工人的队伍。
    社会主义国家的工人已经永远摆脱失业。他们正在为进一步和迅速地提高劳动生产率而斗争。此外，近年来，社会主义国家的工人们更紧密地参加了社会主义经济和企业的实际管理，进一步发挥了他们的主动性。
    报告强调指出，在最近几年中，资本主义国家的工人每当看到社会主义国家工人所制定的伟大目标，特别是苏联七年计划的指标时，无不受到了很大的鼓舞。
    报告说，社会主义国家光辉灿烂的远景和今天已获得的巨大成就，启发和鼓舞着资本主义世界工人阶级的斗争。
    报告接着谈到工会组织参加保卫和平的斗争问题。它指出，根据国际局势的发展情况，保卫世界和平的问题在工会组织和劳动群众的心目中和活动中占着越来越重要的地位。
    因此，工会运动中，经济斗争和保卫和平斗争之间的关系益趋紧密。劳动群众在统一行动中找到了多种多样的方式起来保卫和平。
    在某些国家中，例如日本和英国反对外国原子基地，要求结束核试验的强大的群众示威、全国性运动或游行等，差不多年年都举行。
    工人们有时候还采取更直接的行动。英勇的横滨码头工人在各阶层人民及国际方面的支援下，拒绝卸下外国的导弹。
    就在这一时刻，四百多万日本工人，密切地与最广大人民群众团结在一起，正以空前的声势反对日本军国主义者和美帝国主义者，争取废除日美军事条约。理事会一定会对日本工人和工会为了击退战争势力而进行的典范的斗争，表示热烈的支持。
    法国政府不顾法国工人的一致反对在撒哈拉进行原子试验，引起了非洲人民群众和工会组织的愤怒和抗议浪潮。
    非洲的工会组织站在运动的前面，对法国工人反对原子武器竞赛的斗争以及全世界工人阶级要求禁止试验的行动提供了宝贵的帮助。
    澳大利亚、加拿大、拉丁美洲曾组织了签名运动和行动周，要求禁止原子试验，反对德国的原子武装。
    报告指出，世界工联过去和现在在这方面都丝毫不放松它的努力。针对着依赖资产阶级政府和国际组织的“国际自由工联”及天主教工联的不号召劳动群众进行斗争的等待主义的态度，世界工联在这一斗争中推动了和指导了工人们的统一行动和相互支援，它努力改善工会组织与其它向同一方向采取行动的非工会力量之间的合作。
    报告在谈到保卫和平的共同纲领时说，正如我们已经看到的，尽管美帝国主义者的挑衅与阴谋活动阻挠了最高级会议的召开，有利于和平力量的客观条件并没有由于最近发生的事件而改变。
    恰恰相反，可以说这些条件更加强了。美帝国主义的欺骗手法与侵略政策在世界各国人民及工人的面前已被揭穿了。
    但是，和平力量要通过日益强大和团结的经常性斗争才能实现它们在世界上建立持久和平的目标。
    各工会力量在争取和平的斗争中走向有效的配合，今天已成为可能。有可能而且有必要号召工人和工会组织开展斗争，争取：
    ——国际局势的缓和以及和平共处；
    ——全面和彻底裁军，并立即减少战争预算及捐税；
    ——停止和禁止核试验；
    ——维护各国国家主权；
    ——各国人民独立，通过忠实地实施阿尔及利亚人民的自决权并通过与阿尔及利亚临时政府进行会谈结束阿尔及利亚的战争；
    ——消除德国军国主义；
    ——与两个德国缔结和约，解决西柏林问题；
    ——废除日美军事同盟条约。
    此外，最近的事件比任何时候都更清楚地表明，各国工人和人民要求取消美国和其他帝国主义国家在外国领土上的军事基地的必要性。
    报告强调，工人的力量存在于他们的一致斗争之中。它说，我们能够看出，整个工会运动为了向前发展，它再一次面临的关键问题，就是决定性地加强一切工人和各级工会组织之间的统一行动和国际工人阶级的团结。
    无疑地，我们在整个报告中已经看到，沿着这条道路，我们在行动中、经济斗争中、争取和平斗争中、在争取民族独立的斗争中，已经取得了进展。
    国际工人阶级的团结正在发展，过去相互隔绝的工会组织之间的接触和代表团的来往也得到了发展。
    保卫和平，要求停止核子试验，争取真正的全面和彻底的裁军，将是艰巨和长期的斗争。
    为了很好进行这一斗争，一切工会组织之间的合作、国内和国际方面的统一行动、紧密地相互支援，显然变得急迫和必要。
    反殖民主义和保卫各国人民独立的斗争，已达到了一个决定性的阶段。
    我们在上面所叙述的工人斗争的总结，使人们可以预料到，在资本主义国家中，我们正面临阶级冲突的激烈化。
    假使所有全国性的和国际性的工会配合行动来反对垄断资本的联合和集中，就能够取得重大的成就。在帝国主义竭力用阴谋和挑衅来延缓各国工人和人民走向持久和平、消除殖民主义和人剥削人的现象的步伐的时候，全世界工人将加紧国际的阶级团结的不可摧毁的联系，来克服一切障碍。　（新华社5日讯）（附图片）
