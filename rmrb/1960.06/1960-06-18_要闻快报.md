Inner Mongolia Establishes Grain and Feed Base in Pastoral Areas

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is launching a large-scale land reclamation campaign to expand the planting area of ​​crops and establish a grain and feed production base in pastoral areas. From the Ergun River in the northeast to the Alxa Desert in the southwest, there are camps for land reclamation expeditions everywhere. At present, more than 6.73 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed in the region, and more than half of the newly reclaimed land has been planted with crops.

In addition to planting crops on newly reclaimed land, various places have also sown a large amount of feed and forage. Most of the 3.76 million mu of forage and feed bases sown this spring are newly reclaimed wasteland.

Guangdong's Late Rice Seedling Fields Nearing Completion

Guangdong Province is nearing completion of late rice seedling fields, with improved varieties generally accounting for 80%.

The late rice seeds sown throughout the province this year are mostly local improved varieties such as "Chengqiu No. 5," "Tangpu Dwarf," "White Shell Dwarf," and "Shi Shi Qian" that have been tested and identified. Qinzhou County, which has historically had a complex mix of late rice varieties and many inferior varieties, has adopted improved varieties for all late rice seeds this year due to the careful selection and retention of improved varieties during the autumn harvest last year, and all original inferior varieties have been eliminated.

Qinghai State-Owned Farms Begin Summer Reclamation

After overfulfilling the sowing tasks for various crops, state-owned farms in Qinghai Province immediately focused on summer land reclamation. At present, a large number of tractors on various state-owned farms are operating day and night, and 100,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed from June 1st to 8th.

Because the state-owned farms have persisted in implementing the provincial party committee's policy of focusing on large-scale land reclamation, expanding cultivated area, and increasing yields per unit area, the spring sowing area this year has doubled compared with last year.

Hunan Agricultural and Forestry Reclamation Farms Reclaim Land and Diversify Planting

Since the beginning of spring, more than 100 agricultural and forestry reclamation farms in Hunan Province have launched a large-scale land reclamation and expanded planting campaign in accordance with the requirements of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee to take grain as the key link and expand planting. By the end of May, these reclamation farms had reclaimed more than 1 million mu of wasteland and planted grain and other crops. Now, these reclamation farms are continuing to reclaim land, striving to reclaim and plant as much as possible.

Jinbei Area Vigorously Undertakes Basic Farmland Construction

The "catch-up-the-rich" movement in the Jinbei area of ​​Shanxi Province has developed into a new stage. A large number of basic farmland construction projects have been universally built in 2,216 poor management areas throughout the region with an average income of less than 50 yuan per person. By the end of May, 670,000 mu of new irrigated land had been developed, 410,000 mu of terraced fields had been built, 1.3 million mu of afforestation had been completed, and 86,000 mu had been planted with medicinal materials and other crops. The achievements made in five months are equivalent to twice the total development number of last year. At the same time, the collectively-run economy of the whole region has also developed greatly. Within four months, 303 communes established 2,100 factories of various types, with a total output value more than twice that of the same period last year.

Suixian County Carries Out Drought Resistance, Rice Transplanting, and Seedling Rescue Campaign

People's communes in Suixian County, Hubei Province, have given full play to the role of existing water conservancy facilities and launched a drought resistance, rice transplanting, and seedling rescue campaign. By early June, more than 1 million mu of rice had been transplanted throughout the county.

In the drought resistance, rice transplanting, and seedling rescue efforts, all localities have tried their best to conserve water, use water rationally, and adjust water use, so that all water is used and not a single drop is wasted. The Qianjin Management Area, located upstream of the Heiwuwan Reservoir irrigation area in Anju Commune, used the method of collecting scattered water and waterwheel water to transfer the saved canal water to the downstream Heping Management Area, solving the water use problem for their 17,200 mu of rice fields.

Hong'an Achieves a Bumper Harvest by Planting Grain in Forests

In the winter and spring of last year, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, planted more than 120,000 mu of pine, fir, oil tea, tung oil trees, mulberry trees, and various fruit trees on barren hills. Last winter, 50,000 mu of barley, wheat, broad beans, and peas were planted between these forest lands, and a bumper harvest has now been achieved. The third production team of the Yangshan Management Area of ​​Qiliping Commune interplanted 51 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 300 jin per mu. Since the spring of this year, Hong'an County has combined the cultivation of young forests with the interplanting of 110,000 mu of agricultural crops, and the intercropping of forests and grain has promoted the growth of young trees. The survival rate of young forests throughout the county has reached over 90%.
