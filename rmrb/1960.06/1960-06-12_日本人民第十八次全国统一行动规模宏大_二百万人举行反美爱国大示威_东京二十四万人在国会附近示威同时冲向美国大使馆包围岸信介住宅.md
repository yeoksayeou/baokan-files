Xinhua News Agency report: Two million Japanese people held large-scale 18th National Unified Actions involving demonstrations and rallies in 350 locations across the country on the 11th, strongly demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi government, the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and the dissolution of the Diet.

This unified action will continue until the 19th.

In Tokyo, 240,000 people held powerful demonstrations near the Diet. The masses participating in the demonstration included an unprecedentedly broad range of social strata. Farmers from Ibaraki and Niigata prefectures rushed to Tokyo to participate in the patriotic anti-American struggle. The Kyoto delegation was composed of one hundred merchants – members of the Kyoto Industry and Commerce Group Federation. Many housewives and children appeared in the demonstration ranks.

While demonstrations were being held in front of the Diet, several groups of demonstrators headed for the American Embassy, which was heavily guarded by Japanese police. People there angrily shouted slogans such as "Ike, don't come!" and "American soldiers, get out!" A large contingent of students surrounded Nobusuke Kishi's private residence at around 6 p.m. (Detailed report on page five)
