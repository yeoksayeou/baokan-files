Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th: Since the beginning of June, responsible comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and leading cadres of various steel plants have personally gone to the front line of steel production. Together with the workers, they have fiercely attacked the key of the melting rate of the iron-smelting furnace and launched a steel-grabbing battle. From the 1st to the 5th, the city's steel production increased by 32.8% compared with the same period in May.

After the leading cadres went down, they went deep into workshops, sections, and teams, mobilized the masses, grasped the implementation of technical measures, grasped the promotion of advanced experience, and solved key problems in production together with the workers. After the iron-smelting furnace in the third converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 promoted the advanced experience of rapid iron-smelting, the charging could not meet the requirements. The responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee led dozens of cadres to the material yard to transport iron and move coke, which encouraged the production enthusiasm of the workers. At the end of May, the Metallurgical Bureau transferred more than 80 section chiefs, section members, and technical cadres to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 to work while grasping the eight major measures in the steel technology revolution. As a result, the melting rate of the iron-smelting furnace in Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 per hour increased by two to four tons compared with the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: Since May, the First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the main leaders of various ministries, commissions, and bureaus, such as the ministers, directors, and bureau chiefs, have personally gone to the front line of production to strengthen leadership over production. Comrade Liu Lin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, and responsible comrades of the Provincial Planning Commission and the Provincial Coal Bureau went to Xuzhou Coal Mine to vigorously grasp coal production, enabling the mine to achieve a threefold harvest in output, tunneling, and capital construction. The first secretaries of local municipal party committees also led cadres to go deep into factories, mines, ports, stations, and construction sites. The Suzhou Municipal Party Committee moved its office to grassroots factories and mines to work. The First Secretary of the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee organized more than 40 department and bureau chiefs to divide areas, set points, and contract tasks to direct production, basically achieving someone to contract for each factory and someone to manage each line. Leading cadres of various factories and mining enterprises also went deep among the masses and integrated with the masses. The Party Secretary and Director of the Yangzhou Lingyanshan Steel Plant and responsible cadres of various departments went to the furnace and followed the shifts day and night to direct production. The main cadres of Nanjing Chemical Industry Company went to the machines and worked with the workers to find more than 20 production increase measures to "turn summer into winter" (that is, overcome the unfavorable situation of hot weather for chemical production).

The leading cadres going deep into the front line has inspired the revolutionary vigor and labor enthusiasm of the workers. Many workers said: "When the leaders come to the site, our courage is strengthened; when the leaders go to the workshop, our enthusiasm is added." Therefore, production has been rising steadily. The province's pig iron production in May increased by 31% compared with April, and coal production increased by 8.96%. June also achieved a good start, with the average daily output of pig iron in the first five days increasing by 3.02% compared with May, and steel increasing by 8.6%.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 7th: Leading cadres at all levels of the Shandong Province coal system have gone deep into the mines to lead workers in carrying out large-scale high production, which has increased coal mining and tunneling efficiency. From June 1st to 5th, the average daily output of raw coal was more than 2,200 tons more than the average daily output in May, and the footage of roadway tunneling increased by about 2.5% compared with the average daily footage in May.

In the coal-grabbing battle, Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, once went to Xinwen, Zaozhuang, and other coal mines to inspect and guide the work, which greatly encouraged the workers. Xinwen Mining Bureau then put forward the slogan of "Surpassing Zaozhuang and Catching up with Zibo," which set off a competition craze. Responsible persons of the Provincial Industrial Production Committee and the Transportation Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee also went to Zaozhuang and other coal mines to help solve problems such as short-distance transportation. Leading cadres at all levels of the coal mine system led production more deeply than before. The main leading cadres of the Provincial Coal Bureau have recently been dispersed to various major coal mines to help work, and after a certain period of time, they gather together to analyze new problems in production, propose measures, and then disperse them to implement, which has achieved good results.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 7th: Since mid-May, Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Lin, Secretary of the Secretariat, and more than 20 leading cadres, such as the Minister of the Industrial Department, the Transportation Work Department, and the directors of various departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, have gone to the forefront of production in Jilin, Tonghua, Siping, Baicheng, Yanbian, and other places to specifically guide the mass movement of "grabbing materials, high transportation, and ensuring high production" in the province.

First Secretary Wu De and other comrades went to Baicheng area, which is rich in resources and relatively weak in industry in the province, to inspect work and guide production. Song Jiehan, First Secretary of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Shen Yagang, Secretary of the Secretariat, led the city's industrial front to launch a key-tackling campaign, fiercely attacking weak links and key issues in production. At the same time, they also vigorously grasped the promotion of advanced experience to ensure a substantial increase in production in June. In addition to forming 19 working groups to go to factories and mines to solve specific problems in production, the Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also temporarily transferred more than 400 cadres to strengthen the work on the front line of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 7th: Leading cadres at all levels on the industrial front in Shanxi Province have gone deep into the front line of production and live, eat, and work with the broad masses of workers to ensure that production in the second quarter exceeds that in the first quarter and that the production plan for the first half of the year is completed ahead of schedule.

More than 120 leading cadres, such as the director and section chiefs of the Shanxi Provincial Metallurgical Department, formed two teams. One team went to the steel bases and key enterprises in various special zones and cities to assist in the work, so that steel production has been rising steadily. The other team went to other provinces to contact ordering units to strive for the timely supply of materials and equipment in the second quarter. The Party Secretaries, Directors, Factory Directors, and Managers of Yangquan Mining Bureau, Xishan Mining Bureau, Shanxi Machine Factory, Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, and Shanxi No. 5 Construction Engineering Company all went to the front line of production to direct production and seize the preparations for the next step of production. The castings in the iron foundry workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory could not be cleaned up in time. The Party Secretary and Factory Director led more than 200 cadres to clean up more than 300 tons in two days of spare time, ensuring the needs of processing.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 7th: Fujian Province has already sent 6,000 leading cadres and technical cadres to coal and iron mines to participate in production and lead production. They met with grassroots cadres and workers in the workshops, construction sites, and furnace sides of factories and mines to solve problems in production in a timely manner, so that coal and iron production continued to rise.

The leading cadres who went deep into factories and mines paid attention to grasping weak links and summarizing and promoting advanced experience to make production develop in a balanced manner. Li Yuping, Deputy Secretary of the Minhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, led the geological survey team to go deep into the high mountains and dense forests to explore mines. With the help of the local masses, they found high-grade iron ore and immediately organized mining, expanding the production scale of pig iron. After some responsible cadres from the province and Jinjiang Prefecture went to Tianhushan Coal Mine in Yongchun County, they earnestly implemented the system of combining leading cadres, technicians, and workers to solve problems in production, which rapidly increased the daily output of coal.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 7th: Many cadres in the industrial system of Qinghai Province have gone deep into the front line of production, grasping plans, grasping key points, and grasping measures to mobilize the masses to improve production.

At present, 70% of the cadres in many industrial leading organs have gone deep into factories and mining enterprises to eat, live, and work with the workers. More than 80% of the cadres on the capital construction front went to the front line to follow shifts. Bai Xianmin, Director of the Qinghai Provincial Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Bureau, after going deep into the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory, organized employees to learn from the experience of foreign factories, improved iron melting efficiency and molten iron quality, and broke through the weak link of insufficient supply of castings.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 7th: More than 2,200 leading cadres from the city, districts, and various industrial bureaus in Tianjin formed 82 inspection groups to go deep into factories and workshops to mobilize the masses to summarize and promote advanced experience and solve key problems. The "experimental fields" planted by leading cadres at all levels on the front line of production have reached 106. The inspection group composed of municipal-level leading cadres summarized the experience of the Tianjin Signal Factory in product revolution and promotion of new processes and technologies of no-cutting and less-cutting processing, and immediately convened an on-site skill competition to promote it throughout the city. After visiting the product revolution situation of the Signal Factory, the leading cadres of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory immediately went deep into the workshop and worked with the workers to modify the design of 14 kinds of products and 513 kinds of parts, improving product quality and saving a lot of steel and man-hours. The inspection group of Hexi District, led by Wang Yupu, Secretary of the District Committee, established more than 100 automatic production lines and more than 300 automatic single machines that were not perfect enough in the entire district through establishing models and convening a series of on-site meetings, and quickly put them into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th: Since the end of April, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, transferred more than 1,000 cadres from the industrial leading organs to go deep into various factories to strengthen the leadership of production. All factories have also further strengthened and improved the system of leading cadres participating in production and leading production. The leading cadres of Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, which originally had poor leadership in production, recently resumed the system of participating in production and leading production, and organized veteran workers and technicians to solve the problems found on the spot. Leading cadres of the Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory established a system of grasping three times a day, going to the production site to solve problems in the morning, ordering department cadres to go to the site for specific inspection at noon, and grasping production preparation for the next day in the afternoon, grasping it to the end, so that production continued to leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 7th: In the event of Anshan Iron and Steel workers vowing to seize high output in June, leading cadres of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, and the Party Committees and administrative leaders of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel have gone deep into the front line of production to solve key problems in production.

After the leading cadres went deep into production, they paid great attention to ideological education. Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned about the workers' ideological situation and strengthened political and ideological education by working with the workers. Grassroots cadres generally participated in production and proposed to achieve "one doing, two seeing, and three propaganda." One doing is to actively participate in labor and lead everyone; two seeing is to often understand the production situation and ideological emotions of the masses, and do ideological work anytime and anywhere; three propaganda is to publicize the advanced deeds of advanced teams and advanced figures.

After the leading cadres of the municipal, company, and factory and mine party committees went deep into the front line of production, they continuously discovered weak links and organized key-tackling battles by grasping hourly output, furnace output, shift output, and daily output. Many cadres also planted experimental fields on blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces to lead workers to carry out opponent races and performance races between furnaces. Yuan Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Secretary of the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel, and Manager of the Company, picked up a shovel in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant and worked with the workers of the No. 6 open-hearth furnace to carry out the "three diligence, two accuracy, and one ruthlessness" furnace protection performance race. Promoting all open-hearth furnaces to take No. 6 furnace as an example, a furnace protection key-tackling competition was launched, focusing on the three major key points of the front wall, water jacket, and furnace head. From June 1st to 5th, the daily output level of steel and iron of the entire company was further improved compared with the average daily output level in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 7th: Leading cadres at all levels of Chongqing's factories and mining enterprises went deep into the factories, mines, workshops, teams, furnaces, and underground to eat, live, and work with the workers, vigorously grasping the promotion and improvement of major advanced experiences in the technical revolution movement, and promoting continuous rise in production. The Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China often went deep into Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to personally direct the promotion of ten major advanced experiences such as blast furnaces and iron-smelting furnaces.

After the leading cadres of many units went deep into the front line of production, they promptly discovered and solved weak links in production. After the leading cadres of the railway transportation department strengthened the command work and the connection between the dispatching stations, the punctuality rate was significantly improved.
