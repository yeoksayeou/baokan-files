Everyone for Steel

    Ten Pieces of Raincloth
    The wind blew tighter and tighter, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and it looked like there would be a heavy rain at night. Liu Fengyou, the foreman of the transportation section of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, rushed into the office from outside. He picked up the Anshan Daily and saw that there was indeed a heavy rain forecast in the weather forecast column. The eight raw material cranes outside the factory building would be affected by the rain, which would affect production. But the 500 meters of rainproof cloth newly received from the warehouse has not yet been processed, what should we do? He suddenly thought of Sun Yufang, an old man from the sewing group in the Fifteenth Dormitory, he must be able to help. Liu Fengyou hurried to find Xiao Ma, the operator, to discuss it. Xiao Ma hesitated a bit, he considered that Old Man Sun was old, his hands and eyes were not working well, and the raincloth had to be made tonight, which might be too much! Liu Fengyou asked him to try it, and if it didn't work, they could think of other ways.
    Xiao Ma ran to the sewing group of the Fifteenth Dormitory with a pile of rainproof cloth quickly. Old Man Sun took the raincloth and agreed readily: Young man, I can't even ask for this kind of work! Although I can't go to the front line of production to seize steel, it's good to be able to contribute to the great battle for steel! He picked up the raincloth and started working immediately. In less than two and a half hours, ten pieces of raincloth were sewn. He took the raincloth back home and woke up his sleeping wife and daughter, and the whole family launched a lamp-lit eyelet battle, sewing eighty eyelets on the ten pieces of raincloth. Old Man Sun returned to the Fifteenth Dormitory with one foot deep and one foot shallow, and personally handed the raincloth to Xiao Ma, before going home to sleep.
    At two o'clock in the morning this day, it really rained cats and dogs, but the eight raw material cranes were tightly covered and not wet at all.

    十块雨布
    风一阵比一阵紧地刮着，天空阴云密布，看样子夜里定要来场大雨。第一炼钢厂运转工长刘凤有匆匆忙忙地从外面跑进办公室来。他拿起鞍山日报一看，天气预告栏里果然报有大雨。厂房外边的八台原料吊车，让雨浇着就得影响生产。可是新从仓库领来五百米的防雨布还没有加工，怎么办呢？他忽然想起十五宿舍缝纫小组的孙玉芳老大爷，他准能帮忙。刘凤有赶忙把运转手小马找来商量。小马有些犹豫，他考虑孙老大爷年岁大了，手眼不灵，雨布晚上就要赶出来，恐怕够呛！刘凤有让他试试看，不行再想别的办法。
    小马抱着一堆防雨布飞快地跑到十五宿舍缝纫组，孙老大爷接过雨布，满口答应了下来：小伙子，这个活，我请都请不到啊！我虽不能到生产前线去夺钢，可是能为夺钢大战出点力也好啊！他拿起雨布马上干起来，不到两个半小时，十块雨布就缝好了。他又把雨布抱回家去，将睡得正香甜的老伴和女儿叫醒，全家来个灯下抠眼大会战，将十块雨布上的八十来个眼缝好了。孙老大爷又深一脚，浅一脚地回到十五宿舍，亲自将雨布交给小马，然后才回家睡觉。
    这天深夜两点，果真下起瓢泼大雨来，可是八台原料吊车却盖得严严的，一点没湿。
