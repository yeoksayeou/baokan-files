Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The schedule announced by the United States for Eisenhower's visit to Japan, which requires Japan to prepare a convertible car to take Eisenhower from Tokyo Airport to the Imperial Palace, has given the Japanese security authorities, who are panicked in the face of the high tide of the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism and demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi, a headache.

It is reported that Eisenhower's press secretary, Hagerty, instructed the Japanese authorities in April to convert a sedan into a convertible so that Eisenhower could "wave" to the crowds arranged on both sides of the road on the way from the airport to the Imperial Palace (said to be one of the "highlights" of Eisenhower's visit to Japan). On May 31, officials from the Imperial Household Agency reported to the "Eisenhower Security Committee," composed of officials from the Japanese police authorities, the Foreign Ministry, and the Imperial Household Agency, that it had notified the United States that "due to the rainy season," they had to use a sedan with bulletproof equipment.

It is reported that the chief of security of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Yotsui Tamamura, said: Eisenhower's visit is ill-timed, and it is difficult to guarantee complete safety, so we can only do our best. He said that on the 18.7-kilometer road from the airport to the Imperial Palace, placing a police officer every two meters would require at least 18,700 police officers, while the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department can only mobilize a maximum of 15,000 police officers.

An Associated Press report also revealed that the Japanese Foreign Ministry is painstakingly changing Eisenhower's visit schedule in order to ease the people's anti-American sentiment, attempting to give the impression of a "friendly" visit. To this end, Eisenhower's visit to the Diet and playing golf with Nobusuke Kishi may be forced to be changed to "visiting Japanese factories" and "participating in activities for the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States."

    主子前来访问　奴才伤透脑筋
    日本官方害怕在人民反美怒潮中难保艾森豪威尔安全
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：美国宣布的艾森豪威尔访问日本的日程，要求日本预备敞篷汽车把艾森豪威尔从东京机场接到王宫，这件事使得在日本人民反对美帝、要求岸信介下台的斗争高潮面前张惶失措的日本治安当局伤透了脑筋。
    据报道，艾森豪威尔的新闻秘书哈格蒂在4月份指示日本当局，要把一辆轿车改为敞篷车，这样便于艾森豪威尔从机场到王宫的一路上向安排在路两边的人群“挥手示意”（据说这是艾森豪威尔访日的“精采节目之一”）。5月31日，宫内厅的官员向由日本警察当局、外务省和宫内厅官员组成的“艾森豪威尔安全委员会”报告说，它已经通知美国：“由于雨季”关系，不得不改用有防弹设备的轿车。
    据报道，东京警视厅警备部长玉村四一说：艾森豪威尔的访问不合时机，很难保证完全安全，只能尽力而为。他说，从机场到王宫长达十八点七公里的路上，每隔两米就安置一个警察，这至少需要一万八千七百名警察，而东京都警视厅最多只能动员一万五千名警察。
    美联社的一则消息还透露，日本外务省为了缓和人民的反美情绪，正煞费苦心地改变艾森豪威尔的访日日程，企图给人以“亲善”访问的印象。为此，艾森豪威尔访问国会和同岸信介打高尔夫球的节目，可能被迫改为“参观日本工厂”和“参加日美建交一百周年的活动”。
