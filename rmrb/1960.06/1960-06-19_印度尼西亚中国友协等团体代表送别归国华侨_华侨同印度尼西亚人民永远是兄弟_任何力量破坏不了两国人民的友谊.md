She repeatedly emphasized that although certain powerful groups in Indonesia are trying every possible means to undermine the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people, no force can destroy this friendship. She excitedly said to the Overseas Chinese, "You can be sure that after you return to your motherland, you will always be our brothers and sisters."

She added, "The Indonesian people deeply know your feelings when you leave Indonesia. Everyone should be happy: we are confident that we will meet again in the future. Either you come to Indonesia to see us, or we go to China to see you."

Therefore, we can only have a bright future by returning to our motherland."

    印度尼西亚中国友协等团体代表送别归国华侨
    华侨同印度尼西亚人民永远是兄弟
    任何力量破坏不了两国人民的友谊
    新华社17日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚——中国友好协会、印度尼西亚和平委员会、印度尼西亚妇女运动协会等若干印度尼西亚群众团体的十几位代表，16日下午访问了从东爪哇和西爪哇集中在雅加达、准备乘中国政府派到雅加达的轮船回国的华侨。
    印度尼西亚和平委员会主席、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党妇女部负责人阿鲁季夫人，向这些华侨发表了热情的演说。她一再强调说：虽然印度尼西亚某些有势力的集团在想尽办法破坏印度尼西亚和中国人民的友谊，但是任何力量都破坏不了这种友谊。她激动地对华侨说：“你们可以确信，在你们返回祖国之后，你们将始终是我们的兄弟姊妹”。
    她又说：“印度尼西亚人民深深知道你们动身离开印度尼西亚时的感受。大家都应该高高兴兴：我们确信将来会再见面。或者你们到印度尼西亚来看我们，或者我们到中国去看你们”。
    阿鲁季夫人和她的丈夫——前议会副议长、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党主席阿鲁季，在几个月以前曾到中国进行过友好访问。
    印度尼西亚——中国友好协会代表巴里温、印度尼西亚妇女运动协会负责人之一的曼达吉夫人也向华侨发表讲话，同他们告别。印度尼西亚朋友的热情的讲话不时地被华侨长时间的掌声所中断。
    归国华侨的代表也发表讲话表示衷心感谢他们的印度尼西亚朋友热诚的访问。他说，“我们归国华侨当中有许多人是在印度尼西亚这里出生和长大的，我们给印度尼西亚的建设贡献了我们的一份力量。我们希望印度尼西亚将成为繁荣强盛的国家。但是，我们现在受到印度尼西亚某些人士的逼迫，因此无法在印度尼西亚住下去了。因此，我们只有回到祖国去才能有光明的前途。”他向印度尼西亚朋友们保证：“我们将继续巩固中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊”。
    接着，印度尼西亚著名歌唱家杜斌唱“辛辛梭”和其他著名的印度尼西亚民歌。
    这次聚会生动地体现了中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚的友谊，聚会一直举行到晚上才散。
    东爪哇的归国华侨在从泗水前往雅加达的时候，泗水的全印度尼西亚中央职工会分会、印度尼西亚—中国友好协会泗水分会和那里的华侨团体的代表们曾去探望他们并欢送他们。
