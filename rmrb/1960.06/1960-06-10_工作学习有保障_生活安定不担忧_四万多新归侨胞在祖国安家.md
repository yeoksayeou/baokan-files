Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 9th: From January to the end of May this year, over 40,000 overseas Chinese have returned to the warm embrace of the motherland. The vast majority of them were persecuted in Indonesia, displaced, lost their livelihoods, or were unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia and returned to China.

After returning to the motherland, overseas Chinese were quickly assigned to work in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places. Most returned overseas Chinese settled in overseas Chinese farms in various locations. The early rice planted by overseas Chinese from Cibadak, Indonesia, who settled in the State-run Huaxian Overseas Chinese Farm, has already headed and will soon be harvested. Huang Meizhen, who used to be a car driver in Cibadak, is now also driving a car on the farm. Overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire in Bangka, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, have rebuilt happy homes in Dananshan Overseas Chinese Farm, Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm, and Meixian Sanzhen Overseas Chinese Fruit and Livestock Farm. Huang Guixiang, a returned overseas Chinese, has eight children. Her husband was injured and died in the Bangka fire. She took her children to Indonesia without a means of survival. Now, after returning to the motherland, she has settled down on the farm, her life is guaranteed, and the older children are already in school.

A portion of returned overseas Chinese were properly placed in factories and enterprises according to the needs of the motherland and their own conditions. In Guangdong, returned overseas Chinese machine workers were employed in factories and enterprises in Shaoguan, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and other places. Zhu Nanteng, a returned overseas Chinese who practiced medicine for many years, was assigned to continue working as a doctor at the Guangzhou College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Some returned overseas Chinese have returned to their ancestral homes. The Peng Heng family, returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, returned to their hometown in Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province. His mother is spending her old age at home, his older brother and sister-in-law are working as teachers and shop employees respectively, and he himself is working in an agricultural research institute. The family lives and works in peace and contentment.

Returned overseas Chinese students have been placed in the Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Remedial Schools in Jimei, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places. They are enrolled in classes as soon as they arrive and are preparing to take college entrance exams.

Some elderly and disabled returned overseas Chinese have been placed in farms or nursing homes to spend their remaining years. Chen Changlin, an elderly returned overseas Chinese in his seventies, lives with his children and grandchildren at the Huaxian Overseas Chinese Farm. He said: "Thanks to Chairman Mao, we have returned to the motherland to live a stable life and no longer have to live in fear."

After settling down, the returned overseas Chinese still remember the thousands of overseas Chinese who are still suffering from anti-Chinese persecution and living a miserable life in Indonesia. They hope that the Indonesian government will immediately stop anti-Chinese activities and quickly send those displaced overseas Chinese who cannot make a living or are unwilling to continue living in Indonesia back to the motherland, simplify their departure procedures, and allow them to take back their property.

    工作学习有保障　生活安定不担忧
    四万多新归侨胞在祖国安家
    他们盼望印度尼西亚政府立即停止排华活动，迅速遣送那些流离失所无法谋生、或者不愿意继续留在印度尼西亚的华侨回到祖国。同时简化离境手续，允许他们带回自己的财物。
    新华社广州9日电　今年1月到5月底，已经有四万多名华侨回到祖国的温暖怀抱，其中绝大多数是在印度尼西亚遭受到迫害，流离失所、丧失生计，或者不愿意继续居留印度尼西亚而回国的华侨。
    华侨回到祖国后，很快就被安排到广东、福建、广西、云南等地去就业，大多数归侨是到各地的华侨农场落户。到国营花县华侨农场落户的印度尼西亚芝巴德华侨参加种植的早稻已经抽穗，不久就将收割。原来在芝巴德做汽车司机的黄美珍现在也在农场驾驶汽车。在印度尼西亚西加里曼丹邦戛遭受火灾的华侨，回国后分别在大南山华侨农场、陆丰华侨农场、梅县三圳华侨果牧场重新建立了幸福的家园。归侨黄桂香有八个孩子，她的丈夫在邦戛大火中受伤身亡。她带着儿女在印度尼西亚生活无着，现在回到祖国后在农场里安了家，生活有了保障，大的孩子已经上学。
    一部分归侨根据祖国的需要和本人的条件，被妥善地安置在工厂企业里。在广东，归侨机器工人分别在韶关、海口、湛江等地的工厂企业就业。曾经多年行医的归侨朱南腾，被安置在广州中医学院里继续做医师。
    有一部分归侨回到了原籍。印度尼西亚归侨彭恒一家人回到了广东省清远县故乡，他的母亲在家安度晚年，他的兄嫂分别做了教师和商店职工，他自己在农业研究所工作，一家人安居乐业。
    归国华侨学生被分别安置在集美、北京、广州、汕头等地的归国华侨学生中等补习学校里学习。他们随到随编班上课，准备参加升学考试。
    一些年老的丧失了劳动力的归侨，被安置在农场或敬老院里安度晚年。七十多岁的老归侨陈昌麟在花县华侨农场和儿孙们一起生活。他说：“感谢毛主席，我们回到祖国来生活安定，不必担惊受怕了。”
    归侨们安家之后，他们还记挂着成千上万还在印度尼西亚遭到排华迫害、过着悲惨生活的侨胞，他们盼望印度尼西亚政府立即停止排华活动，迅速遣送那些流离失所无法谋生、或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨回到祖国，简化他们的离境手续，并且允许他们带回自己的财物。
