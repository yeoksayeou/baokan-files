    The Han Daughter of the Uyghur People - Yin Chuanling
    By Our Reporter Tan Feng
    In Minfeng County, Xinjiang, a remote area of ​​the motherland under the Kunlun Mountains, whenever Yin Chuanling's name is mentioned, the Uyghur people will give a thumbs up and say: "Yin Chuanling? She is a good doctor of the Communist Party, a good daughter of us Uyghurs!"
    Yin Chuanling, who is called "good daughter" by the Uyghur people, comes from Jiangsu Province, thousands of miles away. In 1955, after graduating from Yangzhou Medical School, Yin Chuanling took the initiative to request work in the frontier areas of the motherland. Yin Chuanling has worked in Minfeng County Hospital for several years. She travels in this remote mountainous area blocked by the Taklimakan Desert, relieving the pain of Uyghur farmers and herdsmen from diseases. She is warmly loved by the local people and has been repeatedly named an advanced worker and a model doctor. This time, she gloriously attended the National Congress of Cultural, Educational, and Public Health Heroes.

    The Glorious Task Entrusted by the Party
    From the beautiful mountains and rivers of Jiangnan to Minfeng County under the Kunlun Mountains, Yin Chuanling not only had many changes in her living habits, but also experienced some twists and turns in her thinking. After leaving school, she came to Minfeng County with full enthusiasm. But when she saw that the newly established county hospital only had a few dilapidated earthen houses, lacking both equipment and cadres, she felt half-hearted. She thought, "I'm all alone, how can I work? If others are sick, I can treat them, but what if I get sick?" She regretted coming to Minfeng a bit. But she also felt that this idea was not right. She remembered what the county party secretary said to her when she first arrived: "You are the first Han doctor to come to Minfeng. It is a glorious task entrusted to you by the Party to save lives and heal the wounded for the minority people!" "Can't I overcome difficulties to complete the task assigned to me by the Party?" After a period of intense ideological struggle, she resolutely shook her head and went to the county party secretary to make a profound self-criticism. The county party secretary warmly encouraged her, saying that the Party would help her when she encountered difficulties.
    Yin Chuanling was determined to work hard in Minfeng County and to train herself under difficult conditions. She warmly received patients every day; when she couldn't communicate in the language, she used gestures to inquire about their conditions. She worked conscientiously, was kind and amiable, and the Uyghur farmers and herdsmen who came to see the doctor began to like her. One day, she was seeing a patient when the curtain suddenly rustled, and a young mother holding a child rushed into the medical room, crying as she spoke. The sick child was breathing rapidly, his nostrils flared, and his little face was flushed red. After diagnosis, the child suffered from acute pneumonia, and the situation was very dangerous because he had not been treated early. The child's father and grandmother also came. Yin Chuanling felt her responsibility was great when she saw their anxious faces. The child had to be hospitalized, but the hospital had no wards. The room she lived in was both a bedroom and a clinic. There was no place to put the child if she stayed, but it was dangerous if she didn't. What to do? She decided to let the child live on her bed, and immediately injected antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drugs. At night, she sat on the ground guarding him, preparing medicine and feeding him water like a mother. After three full nights of continuous treatment and careful care, the sick child finally escaped danger. On the day Yin Chuanling sent the child home, the patient's family surrounded Yin Chuanling and kept thanking her. She only understood this sentence: "The doctor sent by Chairman Mao is the savior of our child!" Yin Chuanling immediately felt a warm current running through her body, and deeply realized the profound meaning of the county party secretary's words, "the glorious task entrusted by the Party."

    In Minfeng County, many people know that Yin Chuanling has a Uyghur father. Every time there is a bazaar (market) or festival, the old man Imin Tumichi brings some peaches, apricots, sand dates, etc., to the city to visit his daughter. When the two met, they were as close as family members. How did the old and young people from different ethnic groups become father and daughter? There is a story behind this. One evening in the spring of 1957, Yin Chuanling, who had been busy all day, was about to return to her room to rest when she went out and saw an old man squatting at the entrance of the hospital, holding his stomach with both hands, his brows furrowed, looking very painful. Yin Chuanling asked him, "Are you sick?" The old man shook his head and said, "I'm not sick, I just can't urinate, and my stomach hurts so much that I can't walk, so I'm resting here!" This old man was Imin Tumichi, who was suffering from gonococcal urethral stricture. He had been unable to urinate for a day and a half. If he was not rescued urgently, there was a risk of bladder rupture. Yin Chuanling immediately helped the old man into the ward and performed surgery on him overnight to drain and catheterize urine, relieving the old man's pain. According to his condition, Imin Tumichi needed to go to a specialized hospital with better conditions in order to be cured. Yin Chuanling went to the county to get a letter of introduction, and personally went to the station to buy a ticket, and finally put him on the bus. Imin Tumichi was moved to tears.

    Lofty Style
    Yin Chuanling is very considerate of patients and treats their pain as her own. Sometimes she herself is sick, but she still drags her sick body to relieve the pain of patients. Once, she was ill and had been in bed for two days. At this time, someone came to ask a doctor to see an emergency patient. She thought that her pain was tolerable, and if she missed someone else's emergency, it would be a matter of life and death. So, she used all her strength, got out of bed, took the medicine, and went out. The patient's home was more than a mile away from the hospital. Yin Chuanling staggered to the patient's home, already covered in sweat and very tired. The patient woke up after emergency treatment, and the fever began to subside. Yin Chuanling was relieved. She told the patient that she would come back in two hours to give another injection. When she went back, she felt that her dizziness and abdominal pain were getting tighter and tighter. When she was only one hundred meters away from the hospital, she felt dizzy and fainted on the road. When she was awakened by her comrades, the first thing she asked when she opened her eyes was, "Has the patient's second injection been given yet?"

    Dedicate Youth to the People of the Frontier
    Yin Chuanling often encountered various complex diseases in the medical process, and the knowledge she learned in junior medical school was difficult to complete the tasks she faced. But Yin Chuanling has a determination to serve the people wholeheartedly. She knows that in order to complete the task assigned to her by the Party in this place with poor medical conditions, she must constantly improve her professional level. Diligent self-study has become an important subject in her life. Without a teacher, she widely subscribes to various medical and health magazines and books; if she doesn't have time during the day, she studies at night. In the four years she has been in Minfeng County, she has not only learned medical knowledge in internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, and otolaryngology, but has also completely learned acupuncture through hard self-study. Yin Chuanling feels that in the frontier with relatively difficult medical conditions, if acupuncture is widely used to treat diseases, it can not only reduce the difficulty of insufficient medicine, but also reduce the pain of patients undergoing surgery. But in Minfeng County, she couldn't find anyone who knew acupuncture to teach her. Yin Chuanling was determined to study on her own. She first selected the parts with particularly significant curative effects, and memorized the acupoints according to the descriptions in the books, referring to the human anatomy diagrams. After several months of hard study, she memorized the acupoints of various parts of the human body, and also understood their functions. But how to verify the effect of learning? She didn't have much confidence in giving patients needles rashly. So she used her own body as an experiment. She was afraid that others would stop her from doing this, so at night, after everyone else was asleep, she closed the door and experimented on herself with needles according to the descriptions in the books. Many needle marks were left on various parts of her body, again and again. After many experiments, she gradually mastered the various acupoints, and then she further treated people. Later, she learned to use acupuncture to treat chronic diseases such as appendicitis, uterine prolapse, and nephritis edema.

    When Yin Chuanling came to Xinjiang in 1955, she was still an eighteen-year-old girl. Now she has gloriously joined the Communist Youth League and has become a red flag for serving the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas.

    维族人民的汉族女儿——殷传玲
    本报记者　谈风
    在昆仑山下祖国边远的新疆民丰县，只要一提起殷传玲这个名字，维吾尔族人民就会竖起大拇指说：“殷传玲吗？那是共产党的好医生，我们维吾尔族人的好女儿！”
    被维吾尔族人民呼作“好女儿”的殷传玲，来自万里之外的江苏省。1955年，殷传玲在扬州医士学校毕业后，主动要求到祖国的边疆地区工作。殷传玲在民丰县医院工作，数年如一日。她奔走在这块被塔里木大沙漠阻隔的边远山区，为维吾尔族农牧民解除疾病的痛苦，受到当地人民的热烈爱戴，屡次被评为先进工作者、模范医生，这次又光荣地出席了全国文教群英会。
    党交给的光荣任务
    从山川秀丽的江南到昆仑山下的民丰县，殷传玲除在生活习惯上有不少的变化之外，思想上也经历了一番波折。离开了学校，她抱着满腔的热情来到民丰县。但是当她一看到初创的县医院只有几间破土房，既缺少设备，又没有干部，她心里就凉了半截。她想：“空空的一个人，这叫我怎么工作呢？别人有病我治，我病了怎办呢？”她有些后悔到民丰来了。但是她又感到这种想法不对头，她想起刚来那天，县委书记对她说的话：“你是第一个到民丰的汉族医生，为少数民族人民救死扶伤是党交给你的光荣任务！”“我不能克服困难完成党交给的任务吗？”她思想上经过一阵激烈的斗争，最后果决地把头发一甩，跑去向县委书记作了深刻检讨。县委书记热情地勉励她说，遇到困难党会来帮助你。
    殷传玲下决心要在民丰县好好工作下去，在艰苦的条件下锻炼自己。她每天热情地接待病人；语言不通，就用手势比划着询问病状。她工作认真负责，态度和蔼可亲，来看病的维吾尔族农牧民，开始喜欢她了。有一天，她正在看病，门帘忽的一响，一个怀抱着孩子的年轻母亲冲进了医疗室，边哭边说。生病的孩子呼吸急促，鼻孔掀动，小脸蛋烧得通红。经过诊断，小孩患的是急性肺炎，由于没有早治，情况很危险。孩子的父亲、祖母也赶来了，殷传玲看到他们焦急的面孔，感到了自己的责任重大。孩子必须住院，但医院没有病房。她住的一间既是卧室，又是诊疗室，留下孩子没地方安放，不留下又眼见有危险，怎么办呢？她决定就让孩子住在自己床上，并立刻给注射退烧消炎药，夜里就坐在地上守护着，像母亲一样为孩子调药、喂开水。整整三个晚上，经过不断的治疗和细心护理，病儿终于脱了险。当殷传玲送孩子出院的那一天，病人一家人围住了殷传玲，不停地说着感谢话，她只听懂这么一句：“毛主席派来的医生是我们孩子的救星！”殷传玲顿时感到一股暖流通过全身，深切体会到县委书记说的“党交给的光荣任务”这句话的深切含意。
    在民丰县城里，许多人都知道殷传玲有一个维吾尔族的父亲。每逢巴札（集市）或节日，伊明吐米其老汉便拿上些桃、杏、沙枣等，到城里来探望他的女儿。两人见了面，亲热的真像家人。一个天南，一个地北，不同民族的老小怎么认成了父女呢？这里面有个故事。1957年春天的一个晚上，忙了一天的殷传玲正要回房去休息，出门看见有一个老汉蹲在医院门口，双手捧着肚子，眉头紧皱，样子非常痛苦。殷传玲问他：“是病了吗？”老人摇了摇头说：“没病，只是撒不出尿，肚子痛的走不了，在这歇一歇！”这个老汉就是伊明吐米其，他患的是淋菌性尿道狭窄症，已经一天半解不下小便，如不急救，有使膀胱破裂的危险。殷传玲立即把老人扶进病房，连夜为他动手术排尿、导尿，解除了老人的痛苦。根据病情，伊明吐米其需要到条件较好的专区医院才能根治。殷传玲到县上开介绍信，又亲自到车站买票，最后把他送上汽车。伊明吐米其感动的哭了。
    崇高的风格
    殷传玲很能体贴病人，把他们的痛苦当作自己的痛苦。有时她自己生病了，也照样拖着带病的身体，去为病人解除病痛。有一次，她正患病，卧床有两天了。这时有人来请医生去看一个急病人。她想到，自己的这点病痛是可以忍受的，如果误了别人的急病，就是有关生命的大事了。于是，她使出混身力气，起了床，带上药物出了门。病人的家离医院有一里多路，殷传玲踉踉跄跄赶到病人家时，已经满身大汗，非常疲累了。病人经过急救苏醒过来了，烧也开始减退。殷传玲这才放了心，她告诉病人过两个小时她再来给打针。当她回去的时候，才感到头晕腹痛越来越紧，走到离医院只有一百多米的时候，一阵天旋地转，晕倒在路上。当她被同志们救醒，睁开眼睛第一句话就问：“病人的第二次针打过了没有？”
    把青春献给边疆人民
    殷传玲在医疗过程中经常遇到各种复杂的病症，她在中级医士学校学得的知识，很难胜利完成面临的任务。但是殷传玲有一颗全心全意为人民服务的决心，她知道要在这个医疗条件很差的地方完成党交给的任务，必须不断提高自己的业务水平。勤奋自学成了她生活中的重要课题。没有老师，就广泛订阅各种医学卫生杂志书籍；白天没时间，就夜里学。到民丰县四年，她不仅学会了内外科、妇科、五官科等多方面的医疗知识，而且完全靠刻苦自修学会了针灸。殷传玲感到在医药条件比较困难的边疆，如果广泛应用针灸治病，既能减少医药不足的困难，又能减轻病人动手术的痛苦。可是在民丰县又找不到会针灸的人教她。殷传玲就决心进行自修。她先挑选疗效特别显著的部分，根据书上说明的针穴，对着人体解剖图记诵。经过几个月的苦学，她记熟了人体各部分的穴位，也了解了它们的作用。但是怎样验证学习的效果呢？冒然给病人扎针，自己没多大把握。于是她就用自己身体作实验。这样作又怕别人阻止，就在晚上等别人都睡了，关上房门，照着书上的说明用针在自己身上作试验。在她身体的各个部位，一次又一次留下了许多针痕。经过多次试验，她渐渐摸准了各种穴位，以后就进一步给人治病。以后又学会用针灸治疗盲肠炎、子宫脱垂、肾炎水肿等慢性疾病。
    殷传玲1955年到新疆时还是一个十八岁的小姑娘。现在光荣的加入了共青团，而且成了为边疆各族人民服务的一面红旗。
