Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese "National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" decided today that if Eisenhower, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people, proceeds to "visit" Japan, then wherever he goes, the Japanese people will hold protest demonstrations there.

The National Council also decided that before Eisenhower arrives in Japan, from the 16th to the 19th, large-scale protest rallies and demonstrations will be held every day.

The National Council decided that on the 14th, it will jointly hold a national conference to defend democracy and demand the dissolution of the Diet with cultural and academic groups. That evening, a youth and women's conference with more than 10,000 participants will be held in Tokyo.

This nationwide joint struggle organization, composed of 140 political parties and groups, reaffirmed today that it will hold a powerful rally and demonstration around the Diet on the 15th, with hundreds of thousands of participants, coinciding with the second general strike.

The National Council held a meeting of its executive committee today. The meeting believed that the unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" launched on June 10th and 11th was a great success.

The meeting pointed out that the demonstration at the airport against U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty on June 10th was a legitimate action against U.S. imperialism. The meeting also believed that when Hagerty tried to drive his car at full speed through the encirclement, his actions were like treating the Japanese people gathered at the airport as "American Western cattle."

The meeting pointed out that the nationwide unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" launched on the 11th was a powerful response to the reactionaries who attacked the protest demonstration on June 10th. The powerful action of the Japanese people repelled this attack, giving a major blow to the Kishi Nobusuke group and U.S. imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Tokyo dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held a meeting this afternoon and formally decided to reject the Kishi Nobusuke group's "suggestion" to jointly "cooperate" in welcoming U.S. President Eisenhower.

The Kishi Nobusuke group had requested yesterday that the Socialist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party hold a three-party summit to discuss "political truce" and "welcoming Eisenhower."

The Central Committee of the Socialist Party decided that it would continue to carry out the movement against Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan and would use its strength to prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Eda Saburo, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, also notified Kawashima Shojiro, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, of the Socialist Party's attitude of refusing to discuss the welcome Eisenhower talks. Eda Saburo pointed out: The Socialist Party cannot agree to Eisenhower's visit to Japan because "it is an attempt to consolidate the Kishi Nobusuke government and aggravate tensions in the Far East."

On the 12th, Sata Tadayoshi, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, issued a statement pointing out that Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan would strengthen the "security treaty" system between Japan and the United States, and drag Japan into the military alliance between the United States and the Philippines, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek group. As a result, it will aggravate tensions in the Far East and risk dragging Japan into war.

It is reported that the Japan Socialist Party sent a letter to the U.S. government on the 11th, expressing its opposition to Eisenhower's current visit to Japan and opposing the United States' forcing the Japanese Diet to "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Coal Miners' Union passed a resolution at its 26th Special Congress held in Fukuoka City today, protesting Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. The Congress also decided to hold a 24-hour strike on June 15th, the day of the second national general strike, to oppose the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet.

The resolution said that coal miners belonging to the Japan Coal Miners' Union will launch various protest activities on June 19th to protest Eisenhower's trip to Japan.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union Congress will continue to be held tomorrow. The Congress will also discuss strengthening support for the long-term struggle of the Miike coal miners against mass layoffs.

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Tokyo dispatch: More than 200 representatives of Korean residents in Japan held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Japan on the 13th, resolutely opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea and demanding that the U.S. invading army immediately withdraw from South Korea.

These representatives of Korean residents held aloft placards and shouted slogans such as "Eisenhower, don't visit South Korea!" and "Yankees, get out of South Korea!"

The delegation of Korean residents in Japan also issued a protest statement. The statement said that Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea is aimed at supporting the South Korean puppet government, which has been severely hit by the South Korean people, strengthening its colonial rule, and further intensifying preparations for a war of aggression. The statement resolutely opposed Eisenhower's activities in South Korea, demanding that the U.S. imperialists, the culprit who caused great disaster to the South Korean people, immediately withdraw all their troops from South Korea and hand over the traitor Syngman Rhee to the Korean people for disposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 13th: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean people are making preparations to hold demonstrations when Eisenhower "visits" South Korea on June 22nd.

It is reported that 600 residents of the slum area of Busan have decided to hold an anti-American demonstration on that day. These people are victims of a fire that occurred three years ago at the U.S. invading army barracks. At that time, the fire caused explosives to explode, killing 45 South Korean residents and burning down 140 shacks. The victims demanded that the U.S. invading army authorities compensate for the loss of 130 million hwan, but to this day, the U.S. invading army authorities have ignored this demand.

It is reported that these angry people are preparing to hold a hunger strike sit-in demonstration on that day. They are actively preparing the flags, placards, and leaflets to be used in the demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, Manila dispatch: The Philippine youth organization "Youth Nationalization Movement" has decided to participate in the demonstration to be held in front of the U.S. Embassy on the 14th when Eisenhower arrives. This demonstration was decided earlier by the National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Philippines, which has 400,000 union members.

Rodolfo Havierana, National Chairman of the Philippine "Youth Nationalization Movement," protested on the 10th against the Manila authorities' threats to suppress mass demonstrations. He said that some officials "are desperately abusing their dictatorial tendencies to the point that democratic procedures are not functioning."

It is reported that for Eisenhower's visit, the Philippine authorities have mobilized 8,000 plainclothes personnel, several battalions of soldiers, and all detectives and foreign police in urban and rural public security departments. There are also reports that a plan has been proposed: all shop windows on the streets that Eisenhower's motorcade will pass through should be closed.

    釜山人民将举行绝食静坐示威　菲律宾青年决定参加示威抗议
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定，如果艾森豪威尔不顾日本人民的反对，前往日本进行“访问”，那末他到那里，日本人民就要在那里举行抗议示威。
    国民会议并且决定，在艾森豪威尔到达日本以前，从16日到19日，每天将举行声势浩大的抗议大会和示威游行。
    国民会议决定，在14日，将同文化界和学者的团体共同举行保卫民主和要求解散国会的全国大会。当天晚上，还要在东京举行将有一万多人参加的青年和妇女大会。
    这个由一百四十个政党和团体组成的全国联合斗争组织今天再次确定，在15日举行第二次总罢工的同时，在国会周围举行数十万人参加的强大的集会和示威游行。
    国民会议今天举行干事会会议。会议认为，6月10日和11日展开的反对新日美“安全条约”统一行动获得了很大的成功。
    会议指出，6月10日在机场对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的示威，是针对美帝国主义者的正当行动。会议还认为，当哈格蒂企图把他的汽车开足马力冲破包围的时候，他的举动就像把聚集在机场的日本人民当成是“美国西部的牛群”。
    会议指出，11日掀起的反对新日美“安全条约”全国统一行动是对攻击6月10日抗议示威的反动派的一个有力的答复。日本人民的强大行动击退了这种攻击，予岸信介集团和美帝国主义者以重大的打击。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天下午举行会议正式决定拒绝岸信介集团提出的关于共同“合作”来欢迎美国总统艾森豪威尔的“建议”。
    岸信介集团曾经在昨天要求社会党同自由民主党、民主社会党举行三党首脑会谈，商讨“政治休战”和“欢迎艾森豪威尔”的问题。
    社会党中央委员会决定，它要继续展开反对艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的运动，并且要用实力阻止批准新日美“安全条约”。
    社会党书记长江田三郎并且把社会党拒绝讨论欢迎艾森豪威尔会谈的态度通知了自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎。江田三郎指出：社会党不能赞同艾森豪威尔访问日本，因为“它是企图巩固岸信介政府和加剧远东的紧张局势”。
    12日，社会党国际局长佐多忠隆发表谈话指出，艾森豪威尔对日本的“访问”将会加强日美两国间的“安全条约”体系，把日本拉入美国同菲律宾、南朝鲜和蒋介石集团的军事联盟中。结果，将加剧远东的紧张局势，并有把日本拖入战争的危险。
    据报道，日本社会党曾经在11日致函美国政府，表示反对艾森豪威尔现在访问日本，并且反对美国强使日本国会“通过”新日美“安全条约”。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本煤矿工会今天在福冈市召开的第二十六次特别大会上通过决议，抗议艾森豪威尔“访问”日本。大会并且决定在6月15日全国第二次总罢工那天举行二十四小时罢工，反对批准新日美“安全条约”，要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会。
    决议说，属于日本煤矿工会的煤矿工人将在6月19日展开各种抗议活动，抗议艾森豪威尔的日本之行。
    日本煤矿工会大会将在明天继续举行。这次大会还将讨论加强支援三池煤矿工人反对大批解雇的长期斗争问题。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：在日本东京的朝鲜侨民代表二百多人13日在美国驻日本大使馆门前举行示威，坚决反对艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜，并要求美国侵略军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    这些朝鲜侨民代表高举着标语牌，振臂高呼“艾森豪威尔不要访问南朝鲜！”“美国佬快从南朝鲜滚出去！”等口号。
    旅日朝侨代表团同时发表了一项抗议声明。声明说，艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜的目的是为了给遭受南朝鲜人民沉重打击的南朝鲜傀儡政府撑腰，加强它的殖民统治，进一步加紧准备侵略战争。声明坚决反对艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜活动，要求给南朝鲜人民造成莫大灾难的元凶美帝国主义从南朝鲜立即撤走全部军队，并且把卖国贼李承晚交给朝鲜人民处理。
    新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民纷纷准备在艾森豪威尔6月22日到南朝鲜“访问”时举行示威。
    据报道，釜山市贫民区的六百名居民已经决定在那一天举行反美示威。这些人是三年前美国侵略军兵营发生的一次火灾的受害者。当时，火灾引起爆炸物爆炸，炸死了四十五名南朝鲜居民，烧毁了居民一百四十处窝棚。受害居民当时要求美国侵略军当局赔偿一亿三千万圜的损失，但是一直到今天，美国侵略军当局对这一要求置之不理。
    据报道，这些愤怒的人民准备在那一天举行绝食静坐示威。他们正在积极准备示威时使用的旗帜、标语牌和传单。
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾青年组织“青年国有化运动”决定参加在14日艾森豪威尔到达时在美国大使馆的前面举行的示威。这次示威是由拥有四十万工会会员的菲律宾全国工会联合会早些时候决定举行的。
    菲律宾“青年国有化运动”全国主席罗多耳福·哈维利亚纳10日对马尼拉当局扬言要镇压群众示威表示抗议。他说，一些官员“正在拼命滥用他们的独裁倾向以致民主程序都不发生作用”。
    据报道，菲律宾当局为了艾森豪威尔的访问，已动员八千名便衣人员，几营士兵和城乡公安部门全体侦探和外籍警察。还有消息说，有人已提出一项计划：在艾森豪威尔的车队将要通过的大街上，所有的商店的窗户都要关闭。
