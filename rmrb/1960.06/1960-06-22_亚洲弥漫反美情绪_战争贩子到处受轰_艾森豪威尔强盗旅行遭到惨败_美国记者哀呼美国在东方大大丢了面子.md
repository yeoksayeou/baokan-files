Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Washington: Many American journalists are describing Eisenhower's recently concluded bandit trip to the Far East in regretful tones.

Smith, the White House correspondent for the United Press International who accompanied the American president on the trip, wrote on the plane on his way back on the 21st that when Eisenhower's entourage left Seoul Airport last night, "a great sigh of relief could be seen among them." According to this reporter, it was because they thought Eisenhower had "escaped the Eastern mobs." Smith said that of all Eisenhower's foreign trips since taking office, this was his "most uneasy trip. This trip was uneasy both emotionally and practically." "The President will not be pleased by those mocking demonstrators on Okinawa either, who forced him to take a shortcut from the American civil government building to the airport… This kind of thing spreads to the whole world in seconds…”. Smith also said that Eisenhower himself "knew that a large part of his trip was overshadowed by the forced postponement of his visit to Japan," "He didn't like this, and knew he was helpless about it."

Smith lamented that for the United States, the situation in the Far East "is so uneasy and so threatening that when the president appeared in public processions in (South) Korea, there was always an American helicopter overhead with a two-hundred-foot-long hanging ladder and a special device to rescue the president from the crowd in case of trouble."

Bartholomew, the president of United Press International, issued a commentary from Tokyo on the 20th saying that when Eisenhower left Asia, he "left behind a turbulent situation in this region with the world's largest population." Bartholomew pointed out that Eisenhower "lost face in the great failure in Japan, which caused particularly great damage (to the United States) here, because it directly contributed to the anticipated political destruction of the pro-Western Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi." He dejectedly said that the United States' "efforts in Japan have achieved results worse than failure."

Bartholomew said, "The US-Japan Security Treaty is now heading for a cliff, and its future is very doubtful… There are still many steps to be taken before the treaty is completed, and each step may be disrupted by any major surge in popular anger."

Salisbury, a "New York Times" reporter who accompanied Eisenhower on his visit to the Far East, also believed in a report from Seoul that Eisenhower's visit was a failure. Salisbury wrote: "It is becoming increasingly clear that any positive results achieved by Eisenhower's visit in any one place cannot compensate for the adverse effects on the United States caused by the cancellation of his visit to Tokyo. Diplomats worry that the weakening of American influence is not limited to the Far East. Recent reports have begun to assess the situation from the perspective of new tensions between the United States and Europe (referring to Western Europe)."

"New York Times" reporter Sulzberger wrote that Eisenhower "was rebuffed" in Japan, which was a "major diplomatic failure," "We have greatly lost face in the East." He said, "This is a fact that cannot be ignored: America's prestige has been seriously damaged by the improper handling of Eisenhower's originally planned trip to Japan."

United Press International reporter Hansley wrote on the 20th: Asia "is now changed," "America's position is deteriorating."

Hansley said, "The chaos in Japan has terrible implications for the West. Many diplomats doubt how valuable the new (US-Japan) security treaty is under the current circumstances." He also said, "In the eyes of American officials, South Korea remains an unpleasant place."

The "New York Times" correspondent in Tokyo admitted in a report that "almost all" residents of Okinawa oppose the American occupation. The reporter said that many Okinawan residents regard Eisenhower's statement that Okinawa and the United States have set a "shining example of mutual benefit" to the world as a well-known mockery.

    亚洲弥漫反美情绪　战争贩子到处受轰
    艾森豪威尔强盗旅行遭到惨败
    美国记者哀呼美国在东方大大丢了面子
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：许多美国记者都以懊丧的语调来描述刚结束的艾森豪威尔在远东强盗旅行。
    随同美国总统旅行的合众国际社白宫记者史密斯21日在回国途中的飞机上写道，艾森豪威尔的随行人员昨天晚上离开汉城机场的时候，“在他们当中可以看出大大松了一口气的情绪”。据这个记者说，因为他们想到艾森豪威尔“摆脱了东方的暴民”了。史密斯说，在艾森豪威尔就职以来的国外旅行中，这是他“最不平静的一次旅行。这次旅行在感情上以及在实际上都是不平静的”。“总统也不会由于冲绳岛的那些进行嘲笑的示威者而感到高兴，这些示威者使他从美国的民政府大厦抄小路到机场去……这种事情在几秒钟之内就向全世界传播开来……”。史密斯还说，艾森豪威尔自己也“知道他的旅行很大一部分由于被迫推迟他对日本的访问而黯然失色”，“他并不喜欢这一点，并且知道他对于这一点是毫无办法的”。
    史密斯叹息说，对美国说来，远东局势“是如此不平静和如此具有威胁性，以致总统在（南）朝鲜的公开行列中出现的时候，头上一直有一架美国直升飞机挂着二百英尺长的吊梯和一个特别的装置，以便在发生麻烦时把总统从群众中救出来。”
    合众国际社社长巴塞洛缪20日自东京发出一条评论说，当艾森豪威尔离开亚洲的时候，他“留下了世界上人口最多的这一地区的动乱局势”。巴塞洛缪指出，艾森豪威尔“在日本的大失败中丢了面子，这在这里造成的（对美国的）损害特别大，因为这直接有助于使日本亲西方首相岸信介个人在政治上遭到预料中的毁灭”。他泄气地说，美国“在日本所作的努力取得了比失败还要糟的结果”。
    巴塞洛缪说，“日美安全条约现在正走向一个悬崖，它的前途是非常可疑的……在条约完成以前仍然有许多步骤要采取，而每一个步骤都可能因为人民怒潮的任何巨大高涨而受到破坏。”
    随同艾森豪威尔访问远东的“纽约时报”记者索耳兹伯里在一篇发自汉城的报道中也认为，艾森豪威尔的访问是一个失败。索耳兹伯里写道：“越来越明显，艾森豪威尔在任何一地的访问所取得的任何积极结果，也不能弥补由于取消到东京的访问给美国带来的不良影响。外交家们担心，美国影响的削弱不仅限于远东。最近的报道开始从美国和欧洲（指西欧）之间的新紧张关系的角度来进行估价。”
    “纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格写道，艾森豪威尔在日本“吃了闭门羹”，是“外交上的大失败”，“我们已经在东方大大丢了面子”。他说，“这是一个无法假装不见的事实：美国的威信已经由于不恰当地处理艾森豪威尔原来计划的日本之行而受到重大打击”。
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱20日写道：亚洲“现在情况改变了”，“美国的地位在恶化”。
    汉斯莱说，“日本的混乱对西方含有可怕的意义。许多外交家怀疑，在目前的情况下，新的（美、日）安全条约究竟有多大的价值”。他还说，“在美国官员看来，南朝鲜仍然是一个令人不快的地点”。
    “纽约时报”驻东京记者在报道中承认，冲绳“几乎所有”居民都是反对美国的占领的。记者说，许多冲绳居民把艾森豪威尔所说的冲绳和美国向全世界树立了一个“互利的光辉的榜样”看作是人所共知的嘲弄。（附图片）
