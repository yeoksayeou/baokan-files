　　Indigenous Methods and Extensive Tool Reform
　　By our reporter DENG Guoxiang
　　Dali Commune in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, is one of the demonstration communes in the Guangdong Province's agricultural modernization demonstration zone. As early as April of last year, the state began to help this commune accelerate the construction of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. Two substations and an electric irrigation and drainage station were built, and twelve water pumps and twenty-one tractors were added, solving the irrigation and drainage and deep plowing and fine harrowing of 80% of the commune's paddy fields, and supplying electricity for the production of ten factories. These modern agricultural constructions have exerted tremendous power in production. This spring, there was a severe drought here, lasting more than 180 days without a thorough rain. However, the electric motor-driven irrigation and drainage machinery was started, raising the water from the river several meters high and spraying it into the high and dry fields, solving the drought and completing the spring plowing and planting earlier than in previous years. Commune members said, "Tractors plow the fields, turning over a whole hundred acres of land overnight. In the evening, we still saw the fields full of rice stalks, but the next day they were all buried underground. Oh my! The power of mechanization is indeed earth-shattering!" Modernization construction has left a deep impression on the thinking of commune members. They use the saying "Using a hammer in the individual farming era, driving oxen in the collectivization era, and driving iron oxen after communization" to link the relationship between communization and mechanization, and clearly see the bright prospects for rural construction after communization.
　　In the agricultural technology transformation movement, Dali Commune, on the one hand, intensified the modernization construction of electric irrigation and drainage stations, high-voltage lines, and electric plow experiments; on the other hand, it did not relax the mass-based tool reform movement, which was mainly semi-mechanized. Facts have proved that starting with indigenous methods can solve many important links in agricultural technology reform. For example, they used indigenous methods to solve a series of problems that had not been resolved for a long time in the tool reform of pig farms and canteens. In the past, the Fengchi canteen had experimented with using cogon grass pipes as tap water pipes, but they were abandoned because the water leakage problem was not solved for a while. They wanted to use iron tap water pipes like those in the city, but they had not been able to obtain the materials after waiting for half a month. Now, they still use indigenous methods to study and quickly solved the water leakage problem. After this experience was promoted throughout the commune, 29 canteens and 18 pig farms quickly realized self-flowing water without spending a penny. In the previous period, the Fengchi canteen spent more than a month failing to achieve the steam transformation of the stove. After mobilizing the masses to carry out large-scale indigenous method experiments, it was successful in two hours. They used indigenous methods to modify the food delivery car into a steam cabinet, then used gauze paper and paste to seal the gaps to solve the air leakage problem; using cogon grass pipes as steam pipes, the first pot of rice was cooked. When the brigades promoted this experience, some used rice buckets, some used urns, and some used bookshelves to transform them into steam cabinets. In just ten days, 57 canteens realized steam transformation, and 48 canteens and 32 pig farms reformed their stoves (i.e., one stove with three burners, burning fire through the wall). Canteens and pig farms that have achieved these reforms can save 40% of firewood and manpower without spending much money.
　　Now, Dali Commune has established a rice transplanter manufacturing factory, fixed technicians to finalize the design and manufacture rice transplanters, rapid harvesters, and rice threshers, and is actively preparing semi-mechanized agricultural tools for the summer harvest and summer planting. For the tools urgently needed for the current inter-tillage and fertilization, the leaders, technicians, and the masses are combined to carry out large-scale work. Recently, the Commune Party Committee selected Zhongbian Brigade, which had the most backward seedlings, to hold an on-site meeting to promote inter-tillage implements. At this meeting, from County Party Secretary Wu Yong and Zhao Zhenqiang to the brigade leaders at all levels, everyone brought their own inter-tillage implement to the meeting, first weeding in the fields, and after experiments, several types of inter-tillage implements were selected for finalization and promotion. In this way, within four days, the entire commune manufactured more than 2,000 inter-tillage implements; more than 3,000 existing inter-tillage implements were also renovated and repaired, so that all of them were used for inter-tillage in this year's inter-tillage production, eliminating the past operation method of weeding and cultivating by hand, which not only achieved the quality requirements of clean weeding and deep cultivation, but also increased the work efficiency by one to two times.
　　Because indigenous methods were used to reform tools and achieved good results, the enthusiasm of the masses was fully mobilized. For example, Zhongbian Brigade lacked timber for tool reform. Four young people organized a shock team and launched a "treasure from the ground" movement. The four of them dug up more than 750 wooden桩 heads at the foot of the abandoned water conservancy embankment, under the dilapidated houses, on the river bank, and in the abandoned wooden stone weirs. With these wood, they built more than 50 small boats, two tractor ferry bridges, and four pigsties. The "treasure from the ground" movement was responded to by Lubei, Shannan, and Shuitou Brigades, and they organized manpower to dig up fir桩 heads. Lichong Brigade lacked funds, and the commune members actively saved their wages and raised more than 3,000 yuan. The members contributed scrap copper and collected more than 10,000 catties of Kun甸 wood, miscellaneous wood, and waste fir heads cut out during past water conservancy projects to solve the shortage of copper and some hard wood for manufacturing tools.

    土法上马　大改工具
    本报记者　邓国庠
    广东南海县大沥公社是广东省农业现代化示范区的示范公社之一。早从去年4月起，国家便帮助这个公社加速水利化、机械化和电气化的建设。建成两座变电站、一座电动排灌站，添置十二台抽水机、二十一台拖拉机，解决了全社80％稻田的排灌和深耕细耙，并供应十座工厂生产的用电。这些现代化的农业建设，在生产上发挥了巨大的威力。今年春天，这里大旱，持续一百八十多天没有下过透雨。但是，电动机动排灌机械开动起来，把河里的水扬起几米高，喷到高亢田里，解决了旱患，还比往年提早完成了春耕春种。社员说：“拖拉机犁田，一夜之间，把整整一百亩土地都翻过身来。晚间收工还看到满田禾秆，第二天都钻到地底去了。哎呀呀！机械化的威力，确实是翻天复地！”现代化建设，给社员的思想留下深刻的影响。他们以
  “单干时代用鎯头，合作化时赶耕牛，公社化后驶铁牛”的话，把公社化和机械化的关系联系起来，看清了公社化后农村建设的光辉前景。
    在农业技术改造运动中，大沥公社一方面加紧电动排灌站、高压线、电犁试验等现代化建设；另一方面不放松群众性的、以半机械化为主的工具改革运动。事实证明，从土着手可以解决农业技术改革中的许多重要环节。比如他们就以土办法解决了猪场、食堂工具改革长期未解决的一系列的问题。凤池食堂以前曾经试验过用茅竹管做自来水管，只是漏水问题一时未解决就不用了，想搞像城市那样的铁自来水管，结果等了半个月还没有弄到器材。现在，他们仍然用土办法研究，很快就把漏水问题解决了。这个经验在全社推开之后，很快就有二十九个食堂和十八个猪场，一钱不花便实现了用水自流化。前一时期，凤池食堂花了一个多月还没有弄成功的炉灶改革蒸气化，发动群众大搞土法试验后，在两个钟头内就搞成功了。他们是用土办法把送饭车厢改装为蒸气柜，再用纱纸、浆糊封密缝隙，解决漏气问题；用茅竹管来做蒸气管，第一锅就把饭蒸熟了。各大队的食堂推广这个经验时，有的用禾桶，有的用瓮缸，有的用书柜来改装成蒸气柜，仅十几天时间，实现了蒸气化的食堂就有五十七个，改革了炉灶（即一炉三灶、隔墙烧火）的食堂有四十八个、猪场三十二个。实现了这些改革的食堂、猪场，花不了多少钱，就能够节省柴草和人力40％。
    现在，大沥公社建立了插秧机制造厂，固定了技术人员定型制造插秧机、快速收割器和打禾机，积极为夏收夏种准备半机械化农具。对当前中耕施肥所急需的工具，则由领导、技术人员和群众三方面结合起来大搞。最近，公社党委会选择了落后禾苗最多的钟边大队来召开推广中耕器现场会议。在这个会议上，从县委书记吴勇、招振强起，到大队长止的各级干部，人人都自带一部中耕器来开会，先到田里耘田，经过实验，评出了几种中耕器定型推广。这样，四天之内，全社便制造了两千多部中耕器；对过去已有的三千多部中耕器，也进行改装修理，使在今年的中耕生产中，全部实现中耕器化，革除了过去用手除草耘田的操作方法，既达到草净耕深的质量要求，又提高了工效一倍至两倍。
    由于土法上马改革工具获得了很好的效果，充分地调动了群众的积极性。譬如钟边大队改革工具欠缺木材，有四个青年组织了一个突击组，发起“向地下要宝”运动。他们四个人在水利废堤脚下，在烂屋地下，在河边岸脚以及在废置了的木石陂里起出七百五十多条木桩头，用这些木料造出了五十多只小艇、两座拖拉机渡桥和四座猪舍。“向地下要宝”运动，一时在沥北、山南、水头等大队得到响应，纷纷组织人力起杉桩头。沥中大队欠缺资金，社员便积极存储工资，凑集了三千多元。制造工具欠缺铜料和一些质地坚硬的木料，社员们便献出废铜，并搜集了一万多斤坤甸木、杂木和过去修水利时锯出的废杉头来解决。
