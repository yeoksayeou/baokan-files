    Seize the Opportunity, Prepare Well

    The first half of 1960 is about to end, and the production and construction tasks for the second half of the year are already before us. Our current task is to build on the great achievements of the first half of the year, ride the wind and waves, and continue to leap forward, striving for even greater production growth in the third quarter, achieving the goal of the third quarter surpassing the second quarter, and the second half of the year surpassing the first half. To achieve this goal, now all factories and mines must actively prepare for the production of the third quarter, especially for the production of July.

    Doing a good job in production preparation, no matter when or in what enterprise, is a very important task. Our production is in a continuous leap forward, and although the achievements of the previous stage of production are great, the production tasks for the next stage are even greater, so production preparation work is even more important. If we do not prepare well in all aspects for the next stage of production tasks, the next stage of production exceeding the previous stage will be affected. Therefore, in order to make production continuously leap forward and to make the third quarter exceed the second quarter, we must, with the development of production and the alternation of quarters, make production preparation work more adequate and more timely. We should "do one, prepare two, consider three," that is, when taking the first step, prepare for the second step and consider the third step. With such foresight and preparedness, the leadership can always be proactive and production can rise step by step.

    Production preparation for the next quarter is multifaceted. In addition to preparing the necessary raw materials, repairing equipment is also a very important task. "A workman must sharpen his tools if he is to do his work well." With the necessary raw materials, there must also be machinery and equipment that can maintain normal operation. Doing a good job in equipment maintenance is an important step in "sharpening the tools." Good maintenance of old equipment can extend its life, and some can even "rejuvenate." New equipment also needs maintenance. New equipment will "prematurely age" if you do not pay attention to maintenance. After the technical innovation and technical revolution movements were launched, many factories and enterprises reformed their original equipment and also added a lot of new equipment of their own creation. These equipment played a huge role in the production of the first half of the year. We must also make them play a greater role in the production of the second half of the year, which requires that it be repaired early. While repairing equipment, we must also prepare spare parts.

    Due to the widespread promotion of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in the technical revolution, as well as the widespread application of various new technologies and processes, favorable conditions have been created for safe production. Since the beginning of this year, factories' and enterprises' safety production and labor protection have been greatly improved. But this does not mean that we should not pay attention to safe production. On the contrary, the requirements for safe production are even stricter. Because new technologies require new safety production and labor protection equipment, and require the establishment of new operating procedures suitable for safe production. The experience of many enterprises has proven that, after the launch of the mass movement of technical revolution, it is an important task to create various indigenous or combined indigenous and foreign safety production and labor protection equipment based on new technical requirements. On the other hand, we must continue to strengthen the education of workers and masses on safety production. Under certain conditions, whether people maintain a high degree of vigilance in their thinking, and whether they recognize the new requirements for safe production under the new conditions, often plays a decisive role in whether safe production can be achieved. Especially after the use of new technologies, because the mastery of new technologies is not skilled enough, there must be no negligence in safety production.

    The high temperature season has arrived, and the rainy season is approaching. Seizing the current favorable conditions and quickly doing a good job in summer heat prevention and cooling, rain, flood, and wind prevention is also an urgent task. In particular, it should be pointed out that the spring drought this year was long, and the summer rainfall may be more than in previous years. Many newly built enterprises and transportation lines have not yet been tested by high temperatures and rainy seasons, so it is even more necessary to make full preparations as early as possible. Over the years, there has been a good experience in preparing for safe production in summer, that is, to conduct a mass inspection in a practical way, and to conduct an appraisal of mechanical equipment such as heatstroke prevention and cooling, ventilation, and drainage, one by one, and arrange the maintenance schedule according to the severity and urgency. In accordance with the principle of supplementing what is lacking, preparations must be made in all aspects, and good results can be achieved to ensure safe production.

    The current production preparation work is directly related to the continued leap forward in production in the third quarter and the second half of the year. The key to doing this work well still lies in launching mass movements on a large scale, in fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, relying on our own efforts, and resolutely implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and "walking on two legs." Secondly, the work must be grasped meticulously and practically. For example, what needs to be prepared? How to prepare? When will it be ready? The leadership must make plans as soon as possible, go deep into the front line of production to discuss with the masses, take effective organizational and technical measures, and organize forces to achieve the goals within a time limit. General appeals alone cannot solve problems in detail. Time waits for no man. Factories and mines should immediately take action to do all the urgent and necessary production preparation work, to create the necessary conditions for a large increase in production in the third quarter. In this way, our production and construction will certainly continue to rise substantially!

### 抓紧时机，做好准备

    抓紧时机，做好准备
    1960年的上半年就要结束，下半年的生产建设任务已经摆在我们的面前。我们当前的任务，是在上半年取得巨大成就的基础上，乘风破浪，继续跃进，力争第三季度的生产有更大的增长，实现三季超二季，下半年超过上半年的目标。欲达此目标，现在各厂矿企业就必须积极为第三季度的生产、特别是7月份的生产做好准备。
    做好生产准备工作，不论什么时候，什么企业，都是十分重要的大事。我们的生产是持续跃进的，上一阶段生产的成就虽然很大，但下一阶段生产任务更大，因而生产准备工作就越显得重要。如果不从各方面为下一阶段的生产任务做好准备，下一阶段的生产超过上一阶段就要受到影响。因此，要想使生产连续不断地跃进，使第三季度超过第二季度，就要随着生产的发展、季度的交替，把生产准备工作做的更加充分、更加及时。我们应该“做一，备二，考虑三”，这就是在走第一步时，就准备第二步，考虑到第三步。这样高瞻远瞩，未雨绸缪，领导就能时时处于主动，生产就能步步高升。
    下一季度的生产准备工作，是多方面的。除了要准备好必要的原料和材料外，检修好设备，也是一项十分重要的工作。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，有了必要的原料和材料，还必须有能保持正常运转的机器设备。做好设备检修保养工作，也就是“利其器”的重要一着。对老的设备检修保养得好，可以延长寿命，有的还可以“返老还童”。新的设备也同样需要检修保养。新的设备如不注意保养，也会“未老先衰”。技术革新和技术革命运动开展以后，许多工厂企业改革了原有的设备，也增加了不少自己创造的新设备，这些设备在上半年的生产中发挥了巨大作用，我们还要使它们在下半年的生产中发挥更大的作用，这就必须及早检修好。在检修设备的同时，还要把备品备件准备好。
    由于在技术革命中广泛推行了机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化，以及广泛应用了各种新技术、新工艺，为安全生产创造了有利条件，今年以来，工厂企业的安全生产和劳动保护有了很大的改进。但这绝不等于说不要注意安全生产了，相反，对安全生产的要求更加严格了。因为新的技术要求有新的安全生产和劳动保护设备，要求建立新的适合于安全生产的操作规程。许多企业的经验证明，在技术革命的群众运动开展以后，根据新的技术要求，创制各种土的或土洋结合的安全生产和劳动保护设备，是一件重要工作。另一方面，仍然要继续加强对职工群众安全生产的教育。在一定条件下，人的思想上是否保持高度的警惕，是否认识到在新的条件下对安全生产提出的新要求，往往对能否安全生产起着决定性的作用，特别是在新技术使用之后，由于掌握新技术还不够熟练，对于安全生产更不能有丝毫的麻痹大意。
    高温的季节已经到来，雨季也转瞬即至。抓紧当前有利的条件，迅速做好夏季防暑降温，防雨、防洪和防风工作，也是一件刻不容缓的工作。特别应该提出的是，今年春旱时间长，夏季雨水可能比往年多，许多新建企业和交通运输线路还没有经过高温、雨季的考验，因此更要及早做好充分的准备。历年来准备夏季安全生产有一条好经验，这就是切切实实地进行一次群众性的大检查，对防暑降温、通风、排水等机械设备，逐台、逐件地进行一次鉴定，分别轻重缓急，安排检修进度，并根据缺什么补什么的原则，从各方面进行准备，就一定能收到良好效果，保证安全生产。
    当前的生产准备工作直接关系到第三季度和下半年生产的持续跃进。做好这一工作的关键仍然在于大搞群众运动，在于充分发动群众，依靠群众，自力更生，坚决贯彻土洋结合、“两条腿走路”的方针。其次，工作要抓得细，抓得踏实，诸如，需要准备什么？怎样准备？什么时候准备好？领导上要尽速做出规划，深入到生产第一线去和群众一起讨论，采取有效的组织、技术措施，并且要组织力量，限期实现。只有一般号召是不能细致解决问题的。机不可失，各厂矿企业应当立即行动起来，把一切急需的、必要的生产准备工作都做好，为第三季度大增产创造好必要的条件，这样，我们的生产和建设就一定能继续大幅度地上升！
