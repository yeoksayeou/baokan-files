Xinhua News Agency, June 13th:

    The Japanese literary delegation currently visiting Beijing today called upon the Japanese people to turn Eisenhower's visit to Japan into a day for burying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The Japanese literary delegation held a press conference in Beijing this evening, attended by more than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists. At the press conference, delegation leader Hiroshi Noma read out a "Call to the Japanese People" signed by all members of the delegation. The full text of the call is as follows:
    The Japanese literary delegation has been in China for more than ten days. We have had the opportunity to talk with friends from the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Writers Association, and members of the People's Communes. The only thing we want to tell the Japanese people now is how fierce the Chinese people's anger is towards the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." We knew in Japan that the Chinese people opposed this treaty, but since we came to China and came into contact with the real situation, we have further realized the seriousness of the matter, which surprised us greatly.
    The Chinese people have not forgotten the past aggression of Japanese imperialism, nor have they forgotten the sacrifice of tens of millions of people. Please think about it, if we were Chinese, what would we think? The tragic memories of our relatives, friends, and brothers being brutally murdered or dispersed cannot disappear all at once.
    Nevertheless, the Chinese government still hopes to be friendly with Japan and expresses its hope to restore diplomatic relations through all opportunities. We believe that the vast majority of Japanese people should also have the same desire. China suffered the greatest losses in World War II. Therefore, we painfully feel that Japan should bear the responsibility for the war; restoring friendly relations between the two countries should be a priority for Japan in its diplomacy. However, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the mainstream faction of the Liberal Democratic Party, according to the intentions of U.S. imperialism, forcibly passed the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which takes China as the enemy. This is tantamount to declaring war on China. For the Chinese people who are committed to Sino-Japanese friendship, there is no greater impoliteness and insult than this. The Chinese people have become angry. The pain and anger that have been repeatedly suppressed have suddenly erupted because of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Chinese people think this way: "If U.S. imperialism and the Japanese militarists colluding with it dare to point their guns at us, then the 650 million Chinese people will work together with the Japanese people to do everything in their power to overthrow them."
    We came to China and experienced the Chinese people's deep hatred for imperialism and militarism and their firm determination to oppose it.
    We appeal to the Japanese people: Japan is now standing at an important juncture concerning the fate of the nation. People who support the Liberal Democratic Party, please reconsider, are you going to be an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, be enemies with China, and thus return to the dangerous path of war? Or are you going to be citizens of an independent country dedicated to world peace?
    Our people should make the right decision based on their own judgment and must clearly recognize that all wars of aggression are criminal acts, and resolutely refuse to sign a military alliance with U.S. imperialism. Only with the above determination can we maintain the dignity of the Japanese people.
    Chinese newspapers are very concerned about the anti-"Security Treaty," anti-American, and anti-Kishi movements in Japan and report on them. The gradually rising movement has now expanded to a national scale, and the Chinese people are passionately concerned about the rise of this movement. For China, where Taiwan is still occupied by the U.S. military, this struggle is not something that does not concern them. If the people of China and Japan can join hands closely, then now is the time. If we let go of this opportunity and continue to adopt a policy of hostility towards China, then it is tantamount to taking chestnuts out of the fire for the United States in a war of aggression. After coming to China, we learned that the struggle against all acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism has expanded to the whole world. Dear Japanese people, our greatest obligation is to strive for national independence and uphold democracy. The act of forcibly passing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is an act of selling Japan to U.S. imperialism. Precisely because we clearly recognize this, our people have stood up from various different perspectives. The Chinese people are watching us with enthusiasm, and the Chinese people's trust in the Japanese people is increasing day by day. We are not isolated. Let us respond to this support with action! Let us bravely advance and turn the day of Eisenhower's visit to Japan into a day for burying the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!

    After the call was read, the head and members of the Japanese literary delegation answered questions raised by reporters.
    A reporter asked delegation leader Hiroshi Noma for his opinion on Eisenhower's trip to the Far East (including his trip to Japan). Hiroshi Noma pointed out that Eisenhower's purpose in visiting Japan and the Far East was to inspect and consolidate U.S. military bases, which has aroused great anger among the people of Japan and other countries, and will further arouse increasingly strong struggles among the people. He said: Eisenhower, ignoring the opposition of the Japanese people, has decided to visit Japan as scheduled. We firmly oppose it. If he insists on coming to Japan, he will definitely be met with fierce opposition from the Japanese people.
    An Agence France-Presse reporter stationed in Beijing asked delegation leader Hiroshi Noma whether he agreed with the Japanese people using "actual violence" to oppose the actions of U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty, and whether he agreed to use the same method to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Hiroshi Noma said that he did not agree with the term "actual violence." He said: "The Japanese people did not use actual violence to oppose Hagerty. We oppose Kishi Nobusuke's use of violence to forcibly pass the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.' Based on the position of striving for genuine independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the Japanese people firmly oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Those who do not understand the Japanese people's hatred for Eisenhower cannot correctly understand the Japanese people's just action of resolutely opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan." He emphasized that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States is the most orderly. On the contrary, the Kishi Nobusuke government is using police violence to stop the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, which is "violent behavior."
    At the reception, friends from the Japanese literary world also answered other questions raised by reporters.

### 日本文学家代表团向日本人民发出呼吁  把艾森豪威尔访问日本的日子变成埋葬日美军事条约的日子

    日本文学家代表团向日本人民发出呼吁
    把艾森豪威尔访问日本的日子变成埋葬日美军事条约的日子
    新华社13日讯　正在北京访问的日本文学家代表团今天呼吁日本人民，把艾森豪威尔访问日本的日子变成埋葬新日美“安全条约”的日子。
    日本文学家代表团今晚在北京举行记者招待会，出席这个招待会的有中外记者三十多人。在招待会上，野间宏团长向记者们宣读了由代表团全体成员签署的“向日本国民的呼吁书”。呼吁书全文如下：
    日本文学家代表团到中国后已经十几天了。我们有机会和中国人民对外文化协会、中国作家协会的朋友们和人民公社的社员们进行谈话。我们现在愿意告诉日本国民的，只有一点，那就是，中国人民对于新日美“安全条约”的愤怒是如何的激烈。我们在日本国内的时候就知道中国人民反对这个条约，但是，自从我们来到中国接触到真实情况以后，我们更进一步知道事情的严重性，使我们大吃一惊。
    中国人民并没有忘记过去日本帝国主义的侵略，没有忘记曾经牺牲了上千万人的事情。请你们想一想，如果我们要是中国人的话，我们会怎样想呢？自己的亲人、朋友和兄弟被惨杀了或被冲散了，这种悲惨的记忆是不可能一下子就消失的。
    虽然如此，但中国政府还是希望和日本友好，并且通过一切机会向日本表示希望恢复邦交。我们想绝大多数的日本国民也应该有同样的愿望。在第二次世界大战中，中国受到了最大的损失，因此，我们痛感：对中国应负战争的责任；恢复两国友好关系应该是日本在外交上优先要做的事。但是，岸信介内阁和自由民主党的主流派却按照美帝国主义的意图，强行通过了以中国为敌的新日美“安全条约”。这无异于向中国宣战。对致力于日中友好的中国人民来说，没有比这再大的不礼貌和侮辱了。中国人民愤怒起来了。一再抑制下来的悲痛和愤怒，因为新日美“安全条约”而顿时爆发出来了。中国人民是这样想的：“如果，美帝国主义和与它相勾结的日本军国主义者胆敢把枪口对准我们，那么六亿五千万中国人民将和日本人民一道全力以赴地打倒它们。”
    我们来到了中国，体会到了中国人民对于帝国主义和军国主义十分痛恨的心情和反对它的坚定决心。
    我们向日本国民呼吁：日本现在正站在关系到民族命运的重要关头。支持自由民主党的人们，请你们重新考虑考虑吧，是做美帝国主义的帮凶，与中国为敌，从而重新走向战争的危险道路呢？还是做为一个独立国家的国民，以致力于世界和平呢？
    我们国民应该根据自己的判断，采取正确的道路，必须明确认识，一切侵略战争是犯罪行为，断然拒绝同美帝国主义签订军事同盟。有了上述决心才足以保持日本国民的尊严。
    中国报纸非常关心日本国内的反“安全条约”、反美、反岸运动并加以报道。逐渐高涨的运动，目前已经扩大到全民性的规模，中国人民对这一运动的高涨是如何热情地关注。对于台湾还被美军占领着的中国来讲，对这一斗争并不感到是别人的事情。假如日中两国人民能紧密地携起手来的话，那么现在就是时候了。如果放过这一机会而继续采取敌视中国的政策，那么就等于在侵略战争中替美国火中取栗。我们来到中国以后，了解到反对美帝国主义一切侵略行为的斗争已经扩大到全世界的范围。亲爱的日本人民，我们最大的义务是争取民族独立，和拥护民主政治，强行通过新日美“安全条约”的行为是把日本出卖给美帝国主义的行为。正因为我们明确地认识到这一点，我们国民从各个不同的观点一致站立起来了。中国人民热烈地注视着我们，中国人民对日本人民的信任日益增进，我们不是孤立的。让我们用行动来回答这种支援！让我们把艾森豪威尔访日的日子变成埋葬新日美安全条约的日子而奋勇前进吧！

    呼吁书宣读以后，日本文学家代表团团长和团员回答了记者们提出的问题。
    有记者问野间宏团长对艾森豪威尔的远东之行（包括日本之行）的看法如何。野间宏团长指出，艾森豪威尔访问日本和远东的目的，是为了视察和巩固美国的军事基地，已经激起了日本和各国人民的极大愤怒，而且更将激起人民越来越强烈的斗争。他说：艾森豪威尔不顾日本人民的反对，竟然决定如期访问日本，我们坚决反对，如果他硬要到日本来，一定会遭到日本人民的激烈反对。
    法新社驻北京记者问野间宏团长是否同意日本人民用“实际暴力”反对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的行动，以及是否同意用同样办法反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。野间宏团长说，他不同意“实际暴力”这种说法。他说：“日本人民并没有用实际暴力反对哈格蒂，我们反对岸信介用暴力强行通过新日美“安全条约”。本着争取真正的独立、民主、和平、中立的立场，日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。如果不理解日本人民憎恨艾森豪威尔的心情的人，也就无法正确理解日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本这种正义的行动。”他强调地说，日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争，是最有秩序的。相反的，岸信介政府却用警察暴力来阻止日本人民争取民族独立的斗争，这才是“暴力行为”。
    在招待会上，日本文学界朋友们还回答了记者们提出的其他问题。
