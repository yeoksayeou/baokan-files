    Indian "New Century" Weekly Exposes
    Rampant Anti-Communism by Kerala Police in Power
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 2nd. The Indian "New Century" weekly recently published an article exposing that the current coalition government of the Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party in Kerala is implementing a police state, intensifying persecution of progressive forces.
    The article revealed that the current Home Minister of the state government, P.T. Chacko, is a "powerful figure" in the state government, representing the Catholic Church and the wealthy in the state government. The article said, "Since this Home Minister took office, he has been clamoring about the Communist 'fifth column' in government departments." "Now it has progressed from this insinuation to direct action. Officials are suspended on various charges, and their cases are sent to the courts for investigation. This Home Minister has said that he intends to put around six hundred government officials on his 'blacklist', preparing to send them to the courts for investigation." The article also said, "The police department and other departments have ordered the suspension of approximately twenty officials." After the Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party coalition government took office, some police officers who were actively anti-communist became active again.
    The article said that the state government uses these means of suspension, transfer, and demotion to show those who are unwilling to whip and abuse innocent people that "if they want to keep their jobs, they had better start beating communists."
    The article said, "Today in Kerala, even if the Public Service Commission decides that a person is qualified for a certain job, the final decision on his fate will be made by the police. After he is selected by the Public Service Commission, he must have a certificate issued by the police, indicating that he has no connection with any 'subversive activities'." The article pointed out that this rule is completely targeted at the Communist Party of India, "which violates the basic rights guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution, and is a form of political discrimination."
    The article said, "It is not difficult to imagine that once the police obtain such great power, they will use it as a convenient way to make money. Because even a person who has nothing to do with the Communist Party has to give money to the new gang that Chacko is cultivating to rule Kerala if he wants to get a police permit."
    The article said, "In order to make the police responsible for the work of this state, Chacko needs a reliable police machine. He visited various counties to reorganize the police department in order to find out who among his partisans is reliable."
    The article also revealed that the state government banned Indian Communist Party newspapers and publications from entering prisons, attempting to limit the growing influence of the Indian Communist Party. The article said that today, newspapers and periodicals such as "Patriot," "New Life," "People's Century," and "New Century" are banned. Even Pushkin's masterpiece "The Captain's Daughter" has been banned.
    The article said, "On April 5th of this year, the prison authorities took away almost all the books from a communist's cell, including Pushkin's 'The Captain's Daughter'. Only a police minister as ignorant as Chacko would decide that 'The Captain's Daughter' is an obscene book or substandard."

### 印度“新世纪”周报揭露  喀拉拉邦警察当政猖狂反共

    印度“新世纪”周报揭露
    喀拉拉邦警察当政猖狂反共
    新华社新德里2日电　印度“新世纪”周报最近载文揭露，目前的喀拉拉邦国大党和人民社会党联合政府正在实行警察统治，加紧迫害进步力量。
    文章揭露，目前邦政府的内政部长普·特·查科是邦政府中的“有力人物”，他是天主教会和富豪们在邦政府中的代表。文章说，“自从这位内政部长任职以来，他一直在叫嚷什么政府部门中的共产党‘第五纵队’。”“现在已经从这种暗示进到直接行动的阶段。官员们以各种罪名被停职，他们的案件则送交法庭调查。这位内政部长已经说过，他打算把六百名上下的政府官员列入他的‘黑名单’，准备送交法庭调查。”文章又说，“警察部门和其他部门已经下令停止大约二十名官员的职务。”在国大党和人民社会党联合政府执政以后，一些积极反共的警官又重新活跃起来了。
    文章说，邦政府用这些停职、调任和降职的手段向不愿意鞭打和虐待无辜人民的那些人表明，“如果他们要保持他们的工作，他们最好就开始打共产党人。”
    文章说，“今天在喀拉拉邦，即使公务委员会决定一个人有条件担任某项工作，但是最后决定他的命运的将是警察。在他被公务委员会挑中以后，他必须要有警察发给的证件，表明他同任何‘颠复活动’没有关系。”文章指出，这项规则完全是针对印度共产党的，“这违反了宪法保证每个公民所享有的基本权利，这是一种政治上的歧视。”
    文章说，“不难设想，一旦警察获得了这样大的权利，他们将会把这作为捞钱的方便门路。因为即使一个同共产党毫无关系的人想得到警察的许可证件，他也不得不向查科正在培植起来统治喀拉拉邦的新的一帮人送钱。”
    文章说，“为了使警察负责这个邦的工作，查科需要一个可靠的警察机器。他为了重新组织警察部门而遍访各县，以便搞清楚他的党徒中谁是可靠的。”
    文章还揭露邦政府禁止印度共产党报纸和刊物进入监狱，企图限制印度共产党日益增长的影响。文章说，在今天，“爱国者报”、“新生活报”、“人民世纪报”、“新世纪”等报刊都被禁止了。甚至普希金的名著“上尉的女儿”也遭禁止。
    文章说，“今年4月5日，监狱当局从一个共产党员的囚室中拿走了几乎所有的书籍，其中有普希金的‘上尉的女儿’。只有一位查科那样无知的警察部长才会决定‘上尉的女儿’是淫书或者不合标准。”
