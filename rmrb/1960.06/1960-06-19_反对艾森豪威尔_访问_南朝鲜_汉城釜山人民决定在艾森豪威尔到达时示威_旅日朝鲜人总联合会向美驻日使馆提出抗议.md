Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th -- Seoul Dispatch: The people of Seoul, Busan and other places are actively preparing to hold demonstrations on the 19th when Eisenhower arrives in South Korea.

According to Busan Radio, taxi workers in Seoul have decided to strike and demonstrate on the day of Eisenhower's arrival in South Korea and to stage a sit-in in front of the U.S. Embassy. The news said that taxi workers in Seoul have been demonstrating for four consecutive days against the predatory system of "rationing" American gasoline, against intermediate exploitation, and demanding freedom of business. However, the U.S. stooge Heo Jeong group has consistently refused their demands. Therefore, the workers finally decided to demonstrate in front of Eisenhower.

It is reported that the people of Busan will also hold demonstrations to oppose Eisenhower's visit to South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th -- Tokyo Dispatch: The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan issued a statement at a press conference today, resolutely opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea.

After the press conference, a delegation of 1,000 Korean residents in Japan, led by Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Tokyo Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, went to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to submit a protest statement.

The statement pointed out that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East is to intensify tensions in Asia. The statement said that the Korean people express their angry protest against Eisenhower's forced "visit" to South Korea despite the opposition of the Asian people. The statement demanded that Eisenhower immediately roll back to the United States and cancel his trip to South Korea.

The statement also demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from South Korea and all areas of Asia. The statement said that the Korean people, arm in arm with peace-loving people all over the world, are fighting against the U.S. imperialists.

According to the Supervisory Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, from March 15 to May 25 this year, Korean residents in Japan held 1,534 rallies to protest against U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea, with a total of 419,159 participants.
