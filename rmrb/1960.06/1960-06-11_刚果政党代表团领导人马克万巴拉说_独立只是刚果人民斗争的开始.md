Xinhua News Agency, 10th June -- The full text of the speech by Alphonse Makwambala, leader of the Congolese political delegation, at the welcome rally held by people from all walks of life in the capital is as follows: Citizen Comrades:

    Our visit to China is coming to an end. We would like to take this opportunity to formally express our gratitude to the Chinese people for the sincere and warm reception they have given us throughout this trip. The great achievements we have seen, the seminars we have participated in, and the collective or individual visits we have made, all of these have been instructive to us, and we should make good use of them for the prosperity of our country.

    We do not know how to praise the efforts you have made to build your country in such a short period of time. In places where we originally thought we would find poverty, we have found a transformed nation, a nation inspired by strong will and patriotism. We have found a happy nation!

    Tomorrow, Congo will break free from its chains and gain independence, and we believe that the Chinese people are one of the first countries to express friendship to us. It would be ungrateful of us to stubbornly turn our backs on the Chinese people! Therefore, from now on, we should regard ourselves as two friendly countries, two brotherly countries.

    Like us, you have suffered oppression, enslavement, and tyranny. Like us, you have fought for the liberation of your beloved motherland. We have a common enemy that needs to be fought, and that is the colonialists. It is only natural that we unite our forces and no longer fall under the banner of paternalism. Because the defeated will still use various methods to buy us over, divide us, in order to save themselves.

    Independence for us, the Congolese people, is only the beginning of the struggle. This large-scale struggle will be directed at the colonialists: not only Belgium, but also other capitalist countries. In this crucial struggle, we must rely on the support of all friendly countries, especially China. Because once Congo is liberated, it can no longer tolerate a second colonization.

    Comrades: From now on, the doors of China are open to all Congolese people. From now on, we will be able to send our youth, workers, and farmers to your country to learn your working methods, so that we can apply these methods to our country. All of this depends on you! For our part, we only regret one thing, and that is that we will be leaving you soon. If circumstances permit, we could have extended our visit to China, but you understand that we have to participate in a major event in our country's history. Please believe that we will bring the brotherly respect of the Chinese people to our Congolese compatriots!

    In addition, we should understand each other and help each other. Because the venerable and immortal great revolutionary Karl Marx said: "Workers of all countries, unite! Only with unity can we have strength!" For the greatest progress of our two countries, let these famous words be the motto of our newly established Sino-Congolese family! Down with colonialism! Down with imperialism! Long live Sino-Congolese friendship! Long live liberated Congo!

### 刚果政党代表团领导人马克万巴拉说  独立只是刚果人民斗争的开始

    刚果政党代表团领导人马克万巴拉说
    独立只是刚果人民斗争的开始
    新华社10日讯　刚果政党代表团领导人阿方斯·马克万巴拉在首都各界欢迎大会上的讲话，全文如下：公民同志们：
    我们在中国的访问快要结束了。我们愿乘此机会向中国人民正式表示谢意，感谢他们在我们这次旅行的全部过程中给予的由衷的热情接待。我们见到的伟大成就，我们参加的一些座谈会，以及我们所进行的集体或分散的参观访问，这一切对我们来说都是教益，我们应很好地为了我们国家的繁荣而加以利用。
    对于你们在这样短的时期内为了建设国家所作出的努力，我们不知道该怎么来赞扬。在我们原来认为将会发现穷困的地方，我们都发现了一个改变了的民族，一个为坚强意志和爱国精神所鼓舞着的民族。我们找到了一个幸福的民族！
    明天，刚果就要摆脱它的锁链获得独立，我们认为中国人民是最早向我们表示友好的国家之一。要是我们固执地背向中国人民，那就是忘恩负义！因此，从现在起，我们应该看成我们是两个友好的国家，两个兄弟般的国家。
    你们像我们一样曾经遭受压迫、奴役和暴政。像我们一样你们曾经为了亲爱的祖国的解放而进行斗争。我们有着需要斗争的共同敌人，这就是殖民主义者。我们把力量团结起来，再不要倒向父系主义的旗帜下，这是很自然的事。因为战败者还会运用各种方法来收买我们，分化我们，以挽救自己。
    独立对于我们刚果人民来说仅是斗争的开始。这场大规模的斗争将指向殖民主义者：不仅是比利时，而且还指向其他的资本主义国家。在这一具有决定意义的斗争中，我们总的依靠一切友好的国家的支持，特别是中国的支持。因为刚果一旦获得解放，不可能再容忍第二次殖民地化。
    同志们：今后中国的大门向所有的刚果人敞开着，从今以后，我们将能够派遣我们的青年、工人和农民到你们国家来学习你们的工作方法，以便把这些方法运用到我们国家里，这一切就只能取决于你们了！在我们方面，只对一件事情感到遗憾那就是我们很快地就要离开你们了，如果情况允许的话，我们本来可以延长访华期限，可是你们了解，我们要去参与我国历史上的大事。请你们相信，我们一定会把中国人民兄弟般的敬意带给我们刚果的同胞！
    此外，我们还应该彼此了解，互相帮助。因为可尊敬的、不朽的伟大革命家卡尔·马克思说过：“全世界劳动者联合起来！只有团结，我们才有力量！”为了我们两国的最大进步，让这些名言作为我们刚刚建立的中刚大家庭的格言吧！打倒殖民主义！打倒帝国主义！中刚友谊万岁！解放的刚果万岁！
