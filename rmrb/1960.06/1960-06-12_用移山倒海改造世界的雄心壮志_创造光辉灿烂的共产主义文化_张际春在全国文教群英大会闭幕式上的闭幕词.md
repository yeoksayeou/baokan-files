Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: Zhang Jichun delivered a closing speech at the National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism. The full text is as follows:

Comrades Delegates,

The National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism is now coming to a victorious close.

Our congress was conducted under the direct leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and other Party and state leaders personally attended our congress. At this congress, we listened to the instructions given by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, and the report by Comrade Lin Feng on "Vigorously Promote Cultural Revolution, Realize the Intellectualization of Workers and Peasants, and the Laborization of Intellectuals," listened to the instructions and reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier Chen Yi, and Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, and listened to the speeches of many leading comrades from relevant central departments and mass organizations, which were very educational and inspiring. Many delegates spoke at the meeting, reported on their achievements, exchanged experiences, and expressed their determination to continue the Great Leap Forward. The congress has achieved its intended goals and successfully completed its tasks.

Now, comrades, you are about to return to your respective posts, carrying the glorious missions given by the Party and the state, carrying the revolutionary spirit of the congress, and carrying the advanced ideas and advanced experiences you have learned, and throw yourselves into new battles. It is entirely foreseeable that, under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the leading, backbone, and bridging roles of advanced workers, and through the active efforts of all cultural and educational workers and the people of the whole country, a new upsurge in China's cultural revolution will soon emerge.

The Party Central Committee has instructed us: "China's cultural revolution is only just beginning. The cultural revolution is endless. As long as human society exists, this revolution will continue. Before the establishment of a communist society, the main content of the cultural revolution is the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field to determine who will win." We must firmly remember this instruction from the Party Central Committee, carry out class struggle in the ideological field, and continue to deepen the revolution of "promoting the proletarian ideology and eliminating the bourgeois ideology." If we forget this, our cultural and educational work will lose its soul.

In our country, bourgeois ideology is collapsing day by day, and proletarian ideology has already taken a dominant position. However, the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie will continue to exist for a long time. To completely eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology among all the people and greatly enhance communist ideological awareness and moral character, a long and arduous struggle is still needed. On the cultural and educational front, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for leadership has not yet ended. We must continuously consolidate the Party's leadership over cultural and educational work, resolutely oppose any tendencies to weaken the Party's leadership, persist in the ideological remolding of intellectuals, popularize and improve universal education, and strive to realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals.

Internationally, opposing imperialism, especially US imperialism, is our long-term and serious task. We must expose the aggressive and reactionary nature of US imperialism in front of the people of the world, expose its peaceful deceptions and war conspiracies, and wage a resolute struggle against the so-called "Western civilization" and the American way of life that imperialists are trying their best to spread, which are used to paralyze and poison the people of the world.

Modern revisionists, represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, are running dogs serving imperialism. They castrate the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism, advocate class peace, oppose class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, whitewash imperialism, and try to spread illusions about imperialism among the people. We must wage a resolute struggle to thoroughly eliminate these reactionary ideological poisons.

Marxism holds that since human society has been divided into antagonistic classes, the history of all societies is the history of class struggle. Marx and Engels taught us this way at the very beginning of the "Communist Manifesto." As long as there is imperialism, as long as there are the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the world, there must be class struggle between them, and there must be complex and fierce class struggles in all aspects, such as politics, economy, military affairs, and ideology. The class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is the last life-and-death class struggle in human history. As long as the bourgeoisie and its remnants and influences have not been completely eliminated throughout the world, the class struggle will not be extinguished. Anyone who denies this violates the most basic common sense of Marxism-Leninism and violates the most fundamental law of the unity and struggle of opposites.

Before Marx and Engels, many utopian socialists advocated class peace and class cooperation, attempting to persuade the bourgeoisie to voluntarily abandon the capitalist system. What was the result? They were not able to move a single hair of the capitalist system. Marx and Engels were not utopian socialists; they developed utopian socialism into scientific socialism, talking about class struggle instead of class peace. The doctrines of Marx and Engels are the doctrines of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revisionists of the Second International once castrated the revolutionary spirit of Marxism, advocating class peace and class cooperation, and opposing proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin exposed and shattered the revisionism of the Second International and restored and developed Marx's doctrine of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the banner of Leninism, the proletariat and working people of the whole world rose up to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and won the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution. Now, in twelve countries accounting for one-third of the world's population, the rule of the bourgeoisie has been overthrown and the socialist system has been established.

Now, socialism is growing stronger day by day, and imperialism is having an increasingly difficult time. In such a new historical era, modern revisionists represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique have emerged. They have tried their best to blur the distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the distinction between socialism and capitalism, and the distinction between the oppressed and the oppressors, saying that "humanity is irresistibly and deeply entering the socialist era through various ways, entering an era in which socialism is increasingly becoming the content and method of daily practice for all mankind," saying that "war has truly become absurd," and that the head of US imperialism, Eisenhower, has become "the founder of a lasting peace," and that the law that the exploiting classes will not automatically withdraw from the historical stage has become invalid. In short, the Marxist-Leninist doctrines of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat have been thrown by them to the back of their heads.

The attempt of the modern revisionists is very obvious: to paralyze the vigilance of the people of the world against the war and aggression policies of US imperialism, to make the broad masses of working people relax their mass struggles for peace, so as to facilitate imperialism to launch wars of aggression; to disintegrate the fighting spirit of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries and imperialist countries, so that they will forever endure the rule of imperialism and colonialism, forever endure exploitation and oppression, and not rise up in revolution; to spread bourgeois ideas among the people of socialist countries, to induce them to abandon the revolutionary doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, and to conspire to make socialism "peacefully evolve" into capitalism. Therefore, it is the noble historical mission of our generation of communists to thoroughly expose the traitorous face of modern revisionism in serving imperialism, to eliminate the ideological poisons they have spread, to defend the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism, to arm the proletariat and working people of the world with the Marxist-Leninist doctrines of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to strive for the complete victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Comrades, the current international situation is very favorable to us. The people of the world are becoming increasingly aware, and the struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs in various countries is rising. US imperialism and its running dogs have been surrounded by the people of the world, and the noose around their necks is tightening. The traitorous face of modern revisionists in serving imperialism has been recognized by more and more people. Our socialist revolution and socialist construction are closely linked with the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, encouraging and supporting each other. We must always strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, always be loyal to the cause of liberation of the world proletariat, loyal to the cause of liberation of oppressed nations, and consistently stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, and unyieldingly fight to promote the cause of world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism for the people of all countries.

Comrades, the future of our motherland is infinitely bright and beautiful, and the task of our cultural revolution is great and glorious. No difficulty can stop us from advancing victoriously. We must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Mao Zedong, enhance revolutionary awareness, summon up revolutionary vigor, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, push China's cultural revolution to a new upsurge, to coordinate with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, coordinate with the communization movement of rural and urban people, coordinate with the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, greatly promote China's socialist construction, and rapidly change China's "poor and blank" face. Chairman Mao taught us that things are done by people, and the people determine the fate of history. The Chinese people can move mountains and reclaim the seas to transform the world, and they will certainly be able to create a brilliant socialist and communist culture, so that our country will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture.

Long live Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    用移山倒海改造世界的雄心壮志
    创造光辉灿烂的共产主义文化
    张际春在全国文教群英大会闭幕式上的闭幕词
    新华社11日讯　张际春在全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会上致闭幕词，全文如下：各位代表，各位同志：
    全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会，现在就要胜利闭幕了。
    我们的大会是在党中央和国务院直接领导和关怀下进行的。刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、朱德同志、邓小平同志以及党和国家的其他领导人亲自出席了我们的大会。在这次大会上，我们听了陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院所作的指示，和林枫同志关于“大搞文化革命，实现工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”的报告，听了周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、李先念副总理的指示和报告，听了中央各有关部门和群众团体的许多领导同志的讲话，受到很大的教育和鼓舞。许多代表在会上发了言，汇报了成绩，交流了经验，表示了继续跃进的决心。大会已经达到了预定的目的，胜利地完成了任务。
    现在，同志们就要带着党和国家所给予的光荣任务，带着大会的革命精神，带着学习到的先进思想和先进经验，回到各自的工作岗位，投入新的战斗了。完全可以预料，在党的领导下，发挥先进工作者的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，通过全体文化教育工作者和全国人民的积极努力，我国文化革命一定会很快出现一个新的高潮。
    党中央指示我们：“我国的文化革命，还仅仅是开始。文化革命，是无穷无尽的，只要人类社会存在，这个革命就会不断地进行下去。而在共产主义社会建成以前，文化革命的主要内容，是社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面谁胜谁负的斗争。”我们要牢牢记住党中央的这个指示，在意识形态领域里进行阶级斗争，继续深入“兴无灭资”的革命。如果忘记了这一点，我们的文化教育工作就失去了灵魂。
    在我国，资产阶级意识形态一天天地土崩瓦解，无产阶级意识形态已经占了统治地位。但是，资产阶级政治影响和思想影响还要长期存在，在全体人民中彻底扫除资产阶级意识形态的残余，极大地提高共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，还要经过长时期的艰巨斗争。在文化教育战线上，资产阶级同无产阶级争夺领导权的斗争，还没有结束。我们必须不断巩固党对文化教育工作的领导权，坚决反对各种企图削弱党的领导的倾向，坚持知识分子的思想改造，普及和提高全民教育，为实现工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化而斗争。
    在国际范围内，反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是我们长期的严重的任务。我们必须在全世界人民面前，揭露美帝国主义的侵略和反动本质，揭露它的和平欺骗和战争阴谋，同帝国主义者极力散布的、用来麻痹和毒化全世界人民的所谓“西方文明”以及美国生活方式进行坚决的斗争。
    以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，是为帝国主义效劳的走狗。他们阉割马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂，宣传阶级和平，反对阶级斗争和无产阶级专政，粉饰帝国主义，力图在人民中散布对帝国主义的幻想。我们必须为彻底肃清这些反动的思想毒素进行坚决的斗争。
    马克思主义认为，人类社会分为对抗的阶级以来，一切社会的历史，都是阶级斗争的历史。马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中就是这样开宗明义地教导我们的。只要世界上还有帝国主义，还有资产阶级和无产阶级，它们之间就一定要有阶级斗争，就一定要有政治、经济、军事和意识形态等各个方面的复杂的、激烈的阶级斗争。资产阶级和无产阶级之间的阶级斗争，是人类历史上最后的一场你死我活的阶级斗争。只要全世界还没有彻底消灭资产阶级及其残余和影响，阶级斗争就不会熄灭。谁要否认这一点，谁就是违背马克思列宁主义最起码的常识，违背对立面的统一和斗争这个最根本的规律。
    在马克思、恩格斯以前，许多空想社会主义者提倡阶级和平、阶级合作，企图劝说资产阶级自动放弃资本主义制度。结果怎样呢？他们并没有能够动资本主义制度的一根毫毛。马克思、恩格斯不是空想社会主义者，他们把空想社会主义发展为科学社会主义，不讲阶级和平而讲阶级斗争。马克思、恩格斯的学说就是阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说。第二国际修正主义者曾经阉割马克思主义的革命精神，鼓吹阶级和平、阶级合作，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。列宁揭露和粉碎了第二国际修正主义，恢复和发展了马克思主义的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说。在列宁主义的旗帜下，全世界无产阶级和劳动人民起来同帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，取得了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。现在已经在占全世界人口三分之一的十二个国家里，推翻了资产阶级统治，建立了社会主义制度。
    现在，社会主义一天天壮大起来，帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了。在这样一个新的历史时代里，出现了以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者。他们揭力模糊无产阶级和资产阶级的区别，社会主义和资本主义的区别，被压迫者和压迫者的区别，说什么“人类正在通过各种途径不可阻挡地深深地进入了社会主义时代，进入了一个社会主义日益成为全人类日常实践的内容和方法的时代”，说什么“战争已经真正成为荒诞的了”，美帝国主义的首脑艾森豪威尔已经成为“建立持久和平的奠基人”了，剥削阶级不会自动退出历史舞台的规律已经失效了。总之，马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说，已经被他们抛到九霄云外去了。
    现代修正主义者的企图是很明显的，就是要麻痹全世界人民对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策的警惕，使广大劳动人民放松争取和平的群众斗争，以便于帝国主义发动侵略战争；就是要瓦解殖民地半殖民地国家和帝国主义国家人民的斗志，使他们永远忍受帝国主义殖民主义的统治，永远忍受剥削与压迫，不要起来革命；就是要在社会主义国家的人民中间散布资产阶级思想，引诱他们抛弃马克思列宁主义的革命学说，阴谋使社会主义向资本主义“和平演变”。因此，彻底揭露现代修正主义为帝国主义效劳的叛徒嘴脸，清除他们所散布的思想毒素，保卫马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂，用马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说武装全世界无产阶级和劳动人民，争取无产阶级革命事业的彻底胜利，是我们这一代的共产主义者崇高的历史使命。
    同志们，目前国际形势对我们十分有利。全世界人民日益觉悟起来，反对美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗的斗争日益高涨。美帝国主义及其走狗已经陷于世界人民的包围之中，套在他们脖子上的绞索越抽越紧。现代修正主义者为帝国主义效劳的叛徒面目，已经为愈来愈多的人所认识了。我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是和世界各国人民的革命斗争，紧密联系，互相鼓舞，互相支持的。我们要永远加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，要永远忠实于世界无产阶级的解放事业，忠实于被压迫民族的解放事业，始终如一地站在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争的最前列，不屈不挠地为推进各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的事业而坚决斗争。
    同志们，我们祖国的前途是无限光明美好的，我国文化革命的任务是伟大而光荣的，没有任何困难能够阻挡我们胜利前进。我们要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，提高革命觉悟，鼓足革命干劲，和全国人民一道，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，把我国的文化革命推向一个新的高潮，来配合我国工农业生产大跃进，配合乡村和城市人民公社化运动，配合技术革新和技术革命运动，大大促进我国的社会主义建设，迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。毛主席教导我们，事在人为，人民群众决定历史的命运。我国人民能够移山倒海，改造世界，也就一定能够创造出光辉灿烂的社会主义和共产主义文化，使我国以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
