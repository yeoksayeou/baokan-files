Xinhua News Agency, 12th June - "A volcano of people's anger awaits Eisenhower's visit to Japan." Today, the "Soviet Russia" newspaper warned Eisenhower in a commentary.

The commentary, while exposing Eisenhower's conspiracy to visit the Far East, stated that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit is very obvious: to make America's puppets in Asia intensify their military preparations and to further turn some areas of Asia into military satellites of American imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that no words or smiles from the United States can deceive the people. The people of all countries in the Far East oppose Eisenhower's so-called visit. Eisenhower's visit to Japan is nothing less than adding fuel to the fire.

The commentary said that the people of all countries firmly condemn the United States' military adventurist policy and firmly demand an end to the United States' provocations and interference in the affairs of other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 12th June - Romania's "Spark" newspaper published a commentary on the 12th regarding the rising anti-American movement of the Japanese people, saying: "The current general international situation is that the movement of people all over the world against the militarist policies of the American ruling clique is unprecedentedly high and large-scale, and the cold war mongers are increasingly isolated."

The commentary said, "The events currently occurring in Japan are particularly meaningful. As the Kishi Nobusuke government stubbornly insists on approving the Japan-U.S. militarist treaty, tying Japan to the war chariot of American imperialism, the wave of anger of the Japanese people has turned into a real typhoon. Japan has never seen such an anti-American movement as it does today since the war."

The commentary said that the anti-American wave of the Japanese people is also directed against the U.S. President who sabotaged the Paris summit conference with his visit to Japan.

The commentary said, "Eisenhower insists on visiting Japan for the sake of face, but what face can this overseas guest recover under the circumstances of negotiating in an armored car and in the Prime Minister's residence surrounded by barbed wire? The Japanese government insists on Eisenhower's visit just like a drowning man clutching at a straw."

The commentary said, "Events in South Korea, Turkey, and other places have shown that when the people have risen up against a government they despise, any American-made 'lifebuoy' is useless."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th June - The Slovak "Truth Daily" published a commentary today on Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Japan, saying that in view of the Japanese people's firm opposition to the U.S. President's visit to Japan, Eisenhower's attempt to carry out this visit is indeed extremely shameless and stubborn.

The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower's actions in sabotaging the four-nation government summit not long ago also proved that he is stubborn. The commentary said that following the major failure in Paris, this will be another failure of Eisenhower's policy.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th June - Helsinki News: Finland's "People's News" published an editorial on the 11th, commenting on the Japanese people's demonstrations against U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The editorial said that the experience of Eisenhower's press secretary, Hagerty, in Japan shows how Eisenhower will be received if he really goes to Japan.

The editorial said that the Japanese people have understood that American rule means trampling on their democratic rights, military rule and police rule, constant foreign political threats, and an increasing danger of war.

The editorial pointed out that America's "freedom," "democracy," and "security" are causing anger everywhere and are being hated and despised everywhere. People have shouted to American imperialism and their puppets in unison, "Go to hell!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 12th June - Burmese newspapers published editorials on the 11th, condemning Eisenhower's visit to Asia and supporting the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

"Vanguard" pointed out that after sabotaging the four-nation summit, Eisenhower decided to "visit" Japan, Taiwan, and other places in order to further intensify U.S. control over bases in the Far East, to intensify aggression, and to exacerbate international tensions.

"Vanguard" pointed out that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty signed by the Kishi Nobusuke clique will only involve the Japanese people in a war disaster.

    评论指出，美国任何言词和微笑都不能迷惑人民。远东各国人民都反对艾森豪威尔的所谓访问。艾森豪威尔到日本的访问无异是火上加油。

    评论说，“日本目前发生的事件是特别有意义的。随着岸信介政府顽固地要批准日美军国主义条约，把日本系在美帝国主义侵略的战车上，日本人民的怒潮已变成了真正的台风。战后以来，日本从来还没有出现过像今天这样的反美运动。”
    评论说，日本人民的反美浪潮也是针对破坏了巴黎首脑会议的美国总统的访日的。
    评论说，“艾森豪威尔为了面子而坚持访问日本，但坐在铁甲车子里和在铁丝网围着的首相公馆里进行谈判的情况下，这位海外客人又有什么面子可以挽回的呢？日本政府坚持艾森豪威尔访日，就像快溺死的人抓住一根稻草不放的情况一样”。

    新华社布拉格10日电　斯洛伐克“真理报”今天就艾森豪威尔即将访问日本一事发表评论说：鉴于日本人民坚决反对美国总统访问日本，艾森豪威尔要进行这次访问的确是无耻之极和顽固之极。

    新华社12日讯　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰“人民新闻”11日发表社论，评论日本人民反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的示威。
    社论说，艾森豪威尔新闻秘书哈格蒂在日本的经历表明，如果艾森豪威尔真的到日本，他将会受到怎样的接待。
    社论说，日本人民已经明白，美国的统治就意味着对他们的民主权利的蹂躏、军事统治和警察统治、经常性的外国政治威胁以及日益增加的战争危险。
    社论指出，美国的“自由”、“民主”和“安全”正在到处引起愤怒，到处受到憎恨和蔑视。人们已经向美国帝国主义和他们的傀儡齐声高呼，“进地狱去吧！”
    新华社仰光12日电　缅甸报纸在11日发表社论，谴责艾森豪威尔访问亚洲，支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    “先锋报”指出，艾森豪威尔在破坏了四国首脑会谈之后，决定“访问”日本、台湾等地，以便进一步加紧美国对在远东的基地的控制，来加紧进行侵略和加剧国际紧张局势。
    “先锋报”指出，岸信介集团同美国签订的日美军事同盟条约，只会使日本人民卷入战争灾难。
