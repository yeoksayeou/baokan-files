Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th—Shaanxi Province is vigorously promoting high-efficiency, high-quality red banner competition movements during the summer harvest, resulting in a fast and effective harvest. As of June 4th, the province had harvested over 9.45 million mu of wheat. On June 4th alone, the province mobilized 3.5 million harvest workers, harvesting over 2.5 million mu of wheat.

This year, Shaanxi Province has a large wheat acreage, with good growth and rapid ripening, making labor appear very tight at the start of the harvest. In response to this new situation, leaders at all levels moved their offices to the fields, mobilized the masses, and widely launched high-efficiency, high-quality red banner competitions. In Hanzhong Prefecture, which started harvesting earlier, Party Secretary Peng Bin went deep into the grassroots level at the beginning of the summer harvest, personally helping Yang County formulate red banner competition conditions for "clean fields in seven days, cleared threshing grounds in ten days," mobilizing the masses for discussion, and issuing a challenge to neighboring Xixiang County. The masses in Xixiang County waved their sickles and took the lead in rushing to thresh rapeseed, winning the first red banner in the region for rapeseed procurement and storage. The masses in Yang County, upon hearing the news, quickly caught up, winning second place in the region for rapeseed storage, and then spent three days rushing to harvest 180,000 mu of ripe wheat in the plains. Weinan, Dali, Hancheng, and Pucheng counties in the Guanzhong region launched field-based competitions during the harvest, speeding up the harvest and improving its quality. After the North Zhao Management Area of ​​Su Village Commune in Dali County launched a harvest competition between groups and individuals, each person averaged 4.5 mu of wheat harvested per day, more than doubling the original efficiency. After acceptance, the quality of wheat harvesting met the standards of low stubble, no missed ears, and no grain loss.

In the competition, various localities summarized, conducted on-the-spot evaluations, and provided timely rewards, making the movement rise wave upon wave. According to statistics from Xixiang and Yang counties in Hanzhong Prefecture, over 1,300 red banner units and over 14,000 red banner personnel have been selected for the summer harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th—"A good harvest depends on people, not Heaven," and "a great harvest despite a severe drought." Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of cadres and members of the people's communes on Hainan Island have given full play to the incomparable superiority of the people's communes, overcome several months of severe drought, and reaped a bumper harvest of early rice. The broad masses of commune members, filled with the joy of harvest, are waving their sickles to rush to harvest the golden rice. More than half of the island's early rice has already been harvested.

Since the start of the harvest, good news of bumper harvests has been frequently reported. In Wanning County on the east coast, most of the early rice has been harvested. The already harvested early rice fields generally yield about 400 jin per mu. Hele Commune, which has always been a high-yield area, has harvested 81% of its 23,000 mu of early rice. After threshing and weighing, the average yield per mu is 502 jin. Damao Commune, which was originally mostly barren sandy land, has transformed low-yield fields. The average yield per mu of the commune's more than 12,000 mu of early rice reached 345 jin. Changan Commune in Qiongzhong County adopted the method of building ring-field drainage and irrigation ditches to implement acid drainage, acid drying, and acid treatment, and applied more fertilizer, so that the average yield per mu of the commune's more than 520 mu of low-yield acidic fields reached about 400 jin, an increase of more than two times compared with last year.

Hainan Island's bumper harvest of early rice this year is the result of the hard work of cadres and commune members in overcoming drought. The island's early rice production, from land preparation and transplanting to the start of harvesting, has been under prolonged drought conditions. In order to overcome the drought, various localities gave full play to the superiority of the people's communes, carried out large-scale cooperation between counties and communes, and mobilized tens of thousands of people to block the estuaries of the Wanquan River and Changhua River, two of the three major rivers, for the first time. After the Wanquan River was blocked, twelve channels, seven or eight li long, were dug on both sides, enabling 35,000 mu of drought-stricken rice seedlings to be irrigated. Chengmai County, relying on the strength of the communes, blocked more than 300 rivers, dug 104 mountain ponds and reservoirs, and dug more than 1,300 wells in just ten days, enabling 54,000 mu of crops to be protected from drought. From early rice preparation to early rice harvesting, a total of 2,775 large and small rivers on the island were blocked in more than 12,000 places, and the interception of all major rivers was completed in less than a week. At the same time, more than 30,000 ditches were dug, more than 500,000 wells were dug, 140 pumping units and more than 10,000 waterwheels, and more than 100,000 water buckets were mobilized, achieving a bumper harvest despite the severe drought.

In the joy of the harvest, commune members in various places are happily and enthusiastically delivering public grain. Early harvesting areas such as Wanning County and some communes in other counties have completed the annual public grain task ahead of schedule.

While rushing to transplant intermediate rice, various localities are also actively preparing for late rice transplanting, striving for a bumper harvest of rice crop after crop.

    陕西开展夏收高工效竞赛
    海南岛人民战胜大旱夺得早稻丰收
    新华社西安7日电　陕西省各地在夏收中，大搞高工效、高质量的红旗对手竞赛运动，夏收进行得又快又好。到6月4日全省已抢收回小麦九百四十五万多亩。仅6月4日一天，全省出动了三百五十万收割大军，就收回小麦二百五十多万亩。
    今年，陕西省的小麦面积大，长的好，成熟快，一开镰劳动力就显得十分紧张。针对这一新情况，各地领导干部都把办公室搬到田间，发动群众，广泛开展高工效、高质量红旗竞赛。收割较早的汉中专区，夏收一开始，地委书记彭彬就深入基层，亲自帮助洋县制定了七天地净、十天场光的红旗竞赛条件，发动群众讨论，并与邻近的西乡县提出挑战。西乡县群众挥镰上阵，抢碾油菜一马当先，油菜征购入仓首夺全区红旗。洋县群众闻讯急起直追，夺得全区油菜入仓第二名，又以三天的时间抢收了平川地带已成熟的小麦十八万亩。关中地区的渭南、大荔、韩城、蒲城等县在抢收中，开展了地头对手赛，加快了收割速度，提高了收割质量。大荔县苏村公社北赵管理区开展了组与组、个人与个人的收割对手竞赛后，每人每天平均割小麦四亩半，比原来工效提高一倍多，经过验收，割麦质量达到麦槎低、不遗穗、不落粒的标准。
    各地在竞赛中随时总结、就地评比、及时奖励，使运动一浪高一浪。据汉中专区西乡、洋县的统计，已评选出夏收红旗单位一千三百多个，红旗手一万四千多名。
    新华社广州7日电　“丰收在人不在天”，“大旱大丰收”，海南岛各人民公社的广大干部和社员在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的无比优越性，战胜了几个月的严重干旱，夺得早稻大丰收。满怀丰收喜悦心情的广大社员们，正在挥镰抢收金黄色的稻谷，全岛早稻已收割了一半以上。
    开收以来，丰收喜讯频传。东海岸的万宁县，大部分早稻已经收割完毕。已经收割的一部分早稻田，亩产一般达到四百斤左右。历来高产的和乐公社种植的二万三千亩早稻，已收割了81％，经过脱粒过秤，平均亩产五百零二斤。原来大部分是瘦田沙地的大茂公社，经过改造低产田，全社一万二千多亩早稻，平均亩产达到三百四十五斤。琼中县长安公社采取修筑环田排灌沟的办法，实行排酸、晒酸、治酸，并多施肥料，使全社五百二十多亩低产酸性田，平均亩产达到四百斤左右，比去年增长两倍以上。
    海南岛今年获得早稻丰收，是广大干部和社员努力战胜干旱的结果。全岛早稻生产从整田、插秧到开镰收割时，一直处在久旱不雨的情况下。为了战胜干旱，各地充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展了县与县、社与社之间的大协作，动员上万人，把三大河流中的万全河、昌化江的出海口第一次堵塞起来。万全河被堵口后，两岸挖了十二条七、八华里的渠道，使三万五千亩受旱禾苗得到灌溉。澄迈县依靠公社的力量，仅十天内就堵河三百多条，开挖山塘水库一百零四个，打井一千三百多眼，使五万四千亩作物能除旱患。全岛从早稻备耕到早稻收割，共有二千七百七十五条大小河流被堵了一万二千多处，所有大江大河的堵截都不出一个星期便完成了。同时开挖了水渠三万多宗，水井五十多万眼；出动抽水机一百四十部，水车一万多架，戽斗十万多个，实现了大旱获丰收。
    在丰收的喜悦中，各地公社社员都兴高采烈地踊跃送交公粮，早割地区如万宁县和其他县的一部分公社已提前完成全年公粮任务。
    各地在突击抢插中稻，还积极进行准备插晚稻的工作，力争造造水稻丰收。
