    Dedicating Youth to the People's Health Cause
    Liu Jintao, Medical Technician, Hunan Provincial Institute of Parasitic Disease Control

    I am a medical technician who graduated from an intermediate-level health school. I am extremely happy to have the opportunity to participate in this National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education. This is a supreme honor given to me by the Party and the people. I sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao. At the same time, I feel very ashamed that I have not made any achievements in my work and am still far from the requirements of the Party. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the correct leadership of the Party, although I have done a little work for the people, it is insignificant. I will now give a brief report to the leaders and representatives on my work.

    In early 1958, after the Sixth Provincial Schistosomiasis Control Work Conference sounded the call for a Great Leap Forward in schistosomiasis prevention and control, our Institute of Parasitic Disease Control held a general meeting of all staff. The leadership introduced the experience of a group in Hanshou treating 150 people per month and a group in Anhui treating 228 people per month, and called on everyone to "compete with Hanshou and surpass Anhui." After listening, everyone discussed it, some saying, "Treating 150 people a month is barely possible, any more and it won't work." Others said, "Doing so is simply making fun of the patients." At the time, I also had some doubts. Later, the Provincial Party Committee's Schistosomiasis Control Leading Group Office, in order to establish a flag, set an example, and strengthen the confidence of schistosomiasis control cadres, decided to use our schistosomiasis control vanguard group to cultivate a "test plot." On March 2, three of us were sent to the suburbs of Yueyang Chengxiang Town to cultivate this "test plot." At that time, I still lacked some confidence, thinking that even senior doctors were not sure, how could I, a young medical technician who had only graduated for a little over a year, do it? In the past, even when working with some doctors, we only treated dozens of people a month, now to complete the task of treating 150 to 228 people or more per month, could we do it? But then I thought that I was a Party member and firmly believed that with the leadership of the Party, there were no difficulties that could not be overcome. At that time, industrial and agricultural production had set off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward, and spring plowing production was very tense, but some people were plagued by illness and lost their labor power, seriously affecting their health. This situation was clearly incompatible with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Thinking of this, my enthusiasm came. But the treatment was still handled according to the usual routine, and as a result, work efficiency did not improve significantly. Once, Liu Rongzhang, the production team leader of the Desheng Agricultural Cooperative, suffered from late-stage schistosomiasis and urgently requested our treatment. However, according to the treatment regulations, this type of patient could not be treated or had to be treated with the "twenty" day method in an institute with complete equipment. The group's equipment was simple and we were not allowed to admit them. Therefore, we had to repeatedly politely decline and comfort him, telling him to go to the institute for treatment later. Captain Liu angrily said to us, "You don't treat those who are really sick, but you drag those who aren't sick (early stages are not visible) to treat. After some time, my illness will be more serious, and then you won't treat me! Besides, who has that much time to go to the institute for twenty days of treatment?" These words triggered a fierce ideological struggle in me. I felt he was right, and wanted to admit him, but I was afraid of "breaking the rules" and what would happen if something went wrong! Finally, I thought that the Party was calling on everyone to break the rules, wasn't it? If, according to our examination, nearly 40% of the patients were within the scope of contraindications for the three-day treatment method, that is, these people could not be cured with the three-day treatment method, were we just going to let these people be ravaged by the disease? No, definitely not! We boldly admitted him as an exception. On the first day, we carefully made preparations and gave him an injection. The situation was very good that day. We continued to inject him for three days, and his illness was cured. He worked very vigorously, and when he met us on the road, he smiled and said, "Look, I'm doing very well!"

    This fact educated me and liberated my thinking. From then on, I and the comrades in the group, based on the principle of "everything for the patients," constantly innovated treatment methods, broke the old rules in the "Prevention and Treatment Handbook" formulated by experts in the past and regarded as the golden rule, greatly relaxed the scope of admission, so that the vast majority of rural schistosomiasis patients could receive "antimony agent three-day treatment," simplified the registration of medical records and physical examination methods, reduced unnecessary measurement and laboratory work, and pioneered the high-efficiency record of treating 6,000 people per month. Compared with treating 30 people per month before the innovation, the work efficiency increased 200 times. One month's work after the innovation was equivalent to sixteen years of work before the innovation. We also summarized twenty innovations in the antimony agent three-day treatment of schistosomiasis. In the treatment process, by relying on the masses and training "friendship members" and "team leaders," the patients managed themselves. These reforms, after being evaluated by the Provincial "Schistosomiasis Treatment High-Efficiency On-site Conference" and the Provincial Science and Technology Commission, were considered to be in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, and also met scientific requirements, and have been promoted throughout the province.

    In the spring of 1959, after the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," I thought: I am an intermediate-level medical worker and a Communist Party member, I should respond to the Party's call with full enthusiasm and use more and better traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat schistosomiasis. So, from March of last year, I began to more earnestly study the basic knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, general clinical experience, and acupuncture therapy, sometimes reading books such as "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine" and "Acupuncture" until late at night. As a result, I quickly learned acupuncture therapy and general knowledge of the application of Chinese medicine, and in June, I boldly used traditional Chinese medicine "needle sealing therapy" (that is, injecting vitamin B1 along the acupuncture points) to treat late-stage schistosomiasis patients, and the symptoms of liver and spleen shrinkage were successfully improved. After observing the results of treating several batches of cases, significant curative effects were achieved. At the same time, the use of antimony agent enema therapy to treat acute schistosomiasis patients is not only safe but also reduces fever quickly, and the improvement of symptoms is also very significant, saving many critically ill patients in clinical practice. At the provincial symposium on the treatment of acute schistosomiasis in July last year, it was confirmed that this is the main method for treating acute schistosomiasis and it has been promoted and applied.

    Last winter, the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party gave me great encouragement; at the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Industry and Transportation, the instructions of the central leaders and the heroic deeds of the heroes gave me another most profound communist education. I have been thinking, "How should I do more work for the Party, and how should I better dedicate my strength to the people?" At this time, a large-scale movement to prevent and treat hookworm disease was being carried out throughout the province, using the favorable opportunity of winter to treat six million hookworm patients, providing a large number of healthy laborers for the production front and supporting the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, the Central Government held a working conference on eliminating pests and diseases in thirteen provinces and cities in the south, proposing to accelerate the elimination of diseases. So I excitedly made a request to the Party, asking the Party to give me a newer task. The Party considered my request and decided to give us the task of treating hookworm disease. Later, we organized a pioneer three-person treatment group, full of confidence and carrying the glorious task assigned to us by the Party, to Huangshajie Commune in Yueyang. I thought that the task before us was not just to treat a few patients, but to rely on the leadership of the local Party, mobilize the masses, and create experience in high-speed treatment of hookworm disease. According to the instructions of the Party, under the leadership and strong support of the commune Party committee, we fully mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement. In three days, three people treated 10,111 hookworm patients and summarized ten experiences, with a curative effect of over 70%. At present, this therapy has been widely promoted in various places, which has played a great role in accelerating the elimination of hookworm disease.

    The above is my work situation in the past few years. The work I have done is too little. The Party has cultivated me, educated me, and given me very high honors. The Party is the source of all my strength. In short, the Party has given me everything. In my future work, I will resolutely listen to the Party's words better, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "Modesty makes people progress, arrogance makes people lag behind," wherever the Party points, I will rush to, whatever the Party wants me to do, I will do, and dedicate everything I have to the most magnificent health cause, and be a sharp soldier on the front line of eliminating pests and diseases.

    把青春献给人民的卫生事业
    湖南省寄生虫病防治研究所医士　刘锦桃
    我是一个中级卫校毕业的医士，能有机会参加这次全国文教系统群英大会，感到万分高兴，这是党和人民给我的崇高的荣誉。我衷心地感谢党和毛主席。同时，也感到很惭愧，自己在工作中没有做出什么成绩，距离党的要求还很远。大跃进以来，在党的正确领导下，虽然为人民做了一点工作，也是微不足道的。现将我的工作情况向首长和各位代表作一简单汇报。
    1958年初，全省第六次血防工作会议吹起了防治血吸虫病大跃进的号角之后，我们寄生虫病防治研究所里召开了全体职工大会，领导上介绍了汉寿一个组每月收治一百五十人，安徽一个组每月收治二百二十八人的经验，并号召大家“赛汉寿、超安徽”。大家听了以后，议论纷纷，有的说：“一月治一百五十人还勉强可以，再多就不行。”还有的说：“这样做简直是对病人开玩笑。”当时我也有些怀疑，后来省委防治血吸虫病领导小组办公室为了树立旗帜，作出样子，坚定血防干部的信心，以事实来教育大家，便决定在我们这个血防先锋小组种“试验田”，3月2日我们三人被派到岳阳城厢镇郊区搞“试验田”，当时我还有些信心不足，觉得高级医师也没有把握，我这个刚毕业一年多的青年医士能行吗？过去和一些医生下去还只是一月治几十人，现在要完成月治一百五十至二百二十八人以上的任务行不行呢？但又想到自己是个党员，坚信有了党的领导，没有克服不了的困难。当时工农业生产掀起了大跃进的高潮，春耕生产十分紧张，但却有一部分人被病魔纠缠着丧失了劳动力，并严重地影响着身体的健康。这一情况显然与大跃进的形势不相适应，想到这些，我的干劲也就来了。但治疗上还是照常规办事，结果工效仍然没有显著提高。有一次，得胜农业社的生产队队长刘荣章，他患血吸虫病已到晚期，迫切要求我们治疗。但按治疗规章，这种病人是不能治疗的或者要到设备完善的所里用“二十”日疗法医治。小组设备简陋不许收治。因此，我们只好再三婉言谢绝，并安慰他以后到所内去治疗。刘队长气急地对着我们说：“真正有病的，你们不治，没有病的（早期的表面看不出）硬拖来治，再过一些时候，我的病更重了，那你们更不会治了！再说，住所治疗二十天，谁有那样多的工夫去治病。”这几句话，引起了我思想上激烈的斗争，觉得他说得有道理，想收治他，但又怕“犯规章”，出了问题怎么办！最后我想到党不是号召大家打破常规吗？如果根据我们检查有将近40％的病人属于三日疗法禁忌范围的，就是说这些人不能用三日疗法来治好他们的病，难道我们就让这些人任病魔去摧残吗？不能，坚决不能！我们就大着胆子，破例地把他收治了。第一天，我们慎重作好了准备，给他注射了一针，当天情况很好，这样接连注射了三天，他的病好了，劳动得很起劲，在路上碰到了我们还笑咪咪地说：“看，我活得很好呀！”
    这一事实教育了我、解放了我的思想，从此，我和小组的同志们便本着“一切为了病人”的原则，不断地革新治疗方法，打破由专家制定的、过去奉为金科玉律的“防治手册”上的陈规，大大放宽了收治的对象，使农村绝大部分血吸病虫患者都能接受“锑剂三日治疗”，简化了登记病历和检查身体的方法，削减了不必要的测量、化验工作等，首创了月治六千人的高工效纪录。如果与革新前月治三十人比较，提高工效二百倍。革新后一个月的工作等于革新前工作十六年。并总结了锑剂三日疗法治疗血吸虫病技术革新二十条。在治疗过程中，由于依靠群众，训练“友爱员”、“领队员”等，使病人自己管理自己。这些改革，经过全省“血防治疗高工效现场会议”和省科学工作委员会鉴定，认为既合乎多、快、好、省的原则，又符合科学要求，已在全省推广。
    1959年春天，人民日报发表“认真贯彻党的中医政策”社论后，我想：自己是一个中级医务人员，又是共产党员，应该满腔热情地响应党的号召，运用更多更好的中医办法治疗血吸虫病。于是从去年3月起我便更加认真地学习有关中医的基本知识，一般临床经验和针灸疗法，有时阅读“中医学概论”、“针灸学”等书到深夜，结果很快地学会了针灸疗法和一般中药的应用知识，并在6月份大胆运用中医“针封疗法”（即用维他命B1照针刺穴位注射）治疗晚期血吸虫病人，使肝脾缩小的症状获得了成功，经过治疗数批病例的观察结果，都收到显著的疗效。同时，运用锑剂灌肠疗法治疗急性血吸虫病患者，不仅治疗安全而且退热快，症状改善也很显著，在临床上抢救许多垂危病人。去年7月全省急性血吸虫病治疗座谈会上已肯定这是治疗急性血吸虫病的主要方法，并加以推广应用。
    去年冬天，党的八届八中全会的精神，给了我莫大的鼓舞；在全国工业、交通群英会上，中央首长的指示，英雄们的英雄事迹，使我又受到了一次最深刻的共产主义教育。我一直在想，“应该怎样为党做更多的工作，怎样为人民更好地献出自己的力量？这时，全省各地正在开展大规模地防治钩虫病运动，利用冬季有利时机，治疗六百万钩虫病人，为生产战线输送大批健壮的劳动力，支援工农业生产继续跃进。同时，中央所召开的南方十三个省市除害灭病工作会议，提出了加速消灭病害的号召。于是我就激动地向党提出了要求，要党交给我更新的任务。党考虑了我的要求，确定把治疗钩虫病的任务交给我们。后来我们就又组织了先锋三人治疗小组，满怀信心地带着党交给我们的光荣任务，到岳阳黄沙街公社。我想摆在我们面前的任务，不是光治几个病人，而是要依靠当地党的领导，发动群众，创造高速度治疗钩虫病的经验。我们按照党的指示，在公社党委的领导和大力支持下，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，三个人在三天时间内治疗了一万零一百一十一个钩虫病人，并总结了十条经验，疗效达70％以上。目前，各地已普遍推广这个疗法，这对加速消灭钩虫病，起到了很大作用。
    以上就是我几年来的工作情况，我所作的工作太少，党培养了我，教育了我，给了我很高的荣誉。党是我一切力量的源泉，总之，党给了我一切的一切，我在今后的工作中，坚决更好地听党的话，永远记住毛主席的教导，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，党指向哪里，我就奔向哪里，党要我干什么，我就干什么，将自己的一切献身于最壮丽的卫生事业，做一名除害灭病战线上的尖兵。
