    Chairman Mao Gave Me a Pair of Sharp Eyes
    Yang Tongwei, Party Branch Secretary and Communist Youth League Branch Secretary of Fanhao Management District, Xinliu People's Commune, Jianhe County, Guizhou Province

    I was born into a poor peasant family in the Miao mountains of Guizhou. From childhood, I worked as a farmhand for landlords, lacking food, clothing, and the money to attend school. In 1949, when I was seventeen, the Party and Chairman Mao's army liberated my hometown, freeing me from generations of oppression. My life gradually improved, and I started working. From 1955, I served as the Party Branch Secretary and Communist Youth League Branch Secretary of the township. However, in 1957, during the water conservancy construction campaign, an unfortunate incident occurred: I led the blasting on a cliff face and, unable to dodge in time, my eyeballs were damaged by the explosives, and I became blind.

    Being blind, I couldn't directly see the instructions and documents from higher levels, which added a layer of difficulty to my work. I felt it was essential to strengthen my studies. I believed that as long as I studied Chairman Mao's thought diligently, I could do a good job even without sight. So, I asked someone to buy me the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and resolved to study it thoroughly. My method of studying was to have others read to me, and I would listen carefully.

    Over the past two years, I have studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," "The Foolish Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Combat Liberalism," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "The Question of Agricultural Cooperation," as well as parts of "Resolution on Some Questions Concerning the People's Communes," "Marx, Engels, Lenin on Communist Society," and "On the People's Commune," the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China," "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members," "How to Be a Good Communist," and more.

    During my studies, after listening to each article or section by Chairman Mao, I would carefully examine my work and thoughts in light of Chairman Mao's words. I studied the article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work" the most and had a deeper understanding of it. I remember Chairman Mao saying that the real wall of iron and steel is the masses. "We must on no account neglect the vital interests of the masses and their problems of everyday life." This made me realize that before, we paid attention to organizing the masses to engage in production, but we didn't pay enough attention to the masses' lives. Although collective canteens had been set up, the menus were monotonous, with the same food every day and only one dish per meal. The commune members also didn't have a dining hall to eat in. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, I immediately resolved to run the canteen well. I first vacated my newly built three rooms to serve as the canteen dining hall, while my family of eleven lived in two small old rooms. Then, I personally went down to the canteen as the director, organizing the cooks and some Party and Youth League members into a "canteen nutrition research group." I worked with everyone to study the nutrition and diversification of food. In our research, we discovered that when cooking dishes, too much water was added, and the cooking time was too long, which led to a loss of nutrition and poor taste. After researching, we changed our methods. At the same time, we added seven or eight kinds of stir-fried dishes. In terms of cooking rice, we not only had steamed rice and fried rice but also used substitutes to make more than ten kinds of delicious rice dishes. These dishes were very popular with the commune members. Our canteen also became better and more consolidated, and it was recognized as a model canteen in the county.

    Chairman Mao also said in "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work" that the housing problems, clothing problems, and childbirth problems of the masses must be solved. These words also deeply moved me. I thought, Chairman Mao is so concerned about the masses; I am the Party Branch Secretary, but I often thought these problems were private, minor matters and didn't pay much attention to them. After studying Chairman Mao's words, I realized the importance of comprehensively caring for the masses' lives. I then mobilized the team cadres to vacate their surplus houses for the newly moved-in commune members to live in, solving the housing problems of the relocated commune members. In winter, the weather was very cold, and some commune members were working in the fields wearing thin clothes. I acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, immediately convened a meeting of the management district cadres to study the matter, and helped the commune members with thin clothes put on cotton clothes. Therefore, the commune members were very satisfied and said, "He is really our good head of household."

    Before studying Chairman Mao's works, my understanding of class struggle in the countryside was unclear. I thought that after communization, everyone was a commune member, and it was enough to focus on production. I became less vigilant against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and I was also unclear about the unhealthy tendencies of a few wealthy peasants. Once, while I was attending a meeting in the county, an incident occurred in the township: Yang He Xian's wife, the wife of a former bandit company commander, and Yang Zaicai, the director of the advanced cooperative, had a mutual fight. Yang He Xian shouted everywhere, "The commune cadres are beating the masses, this is a criminal in the act," inciting the masses to tie up Yang Zaicai and send him to the township. After I returned from the meeting, I thought something was not right, so I took out the book from the drawer and asked someone to read "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to me. Chairman Mao said in the article, "In the period of building socialism, all classes, strata, and social groups that approve of, support, and participate in the cause of socialist construction belong to the category of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are enemies of the people." He also said that enemies must be resolutely suppressed, and problems among the people must be resolved through persuasion and education, based on the principle of unity – criticism – unity. After listening to these two paragraphs, I thought: Yang Zaicai has always been very active in his work and has a good relationship with the masses. He is just sometimes a little impatient. He has not resisted the socialist revolution or been hostile to and sabotaged socialist construction. How can he be locked up? I also thought that Yang He Xian has always been dissatisfied with cooperativization, and he and his wife often sabotage production. Comparing the two and comparing them to Chairman Mao's words, I felt more and more that something was wrong. I promptly convened a meeting of cadres and the masses for discussion. Through the exposure and denunciation by the masses, the true situation of the incident was clarified. It turned out that Yang He Xian intentionally told his wife to find Yang Zaicai to argue and fight, which led to the fight. After the matter was clarified, it was Yang He Xian who should have been arrested. Through this incident, I deeply realized that only by constantly studying Chairman Mao's works can one discern the direction, stand firm, and handle problems well in the great storms of class struggle. In my subsequent work, when listening to what anyone said, I would consider what class they belonged to and which class their words benefited. This made me able to distinguish between different opinions more clearly than before.

    Although my eyes are blind, Mao Zedong Thought has given me a pair of sharp eyes, enabling me to see many problems in production and work more clearly and understand them better than before. As long as I live, I will fight to the end for the cause of the Party.

### 毛主席给了我一双锐利的眼睛

    毛主席给了我一双锐利的眼睛
    贵州省剑河县新柳人民公社反皓管理区党总支书记
      兼团总支书记  杨通谓
    我生长在贵州苗岭山上一个贫苦农民的家庭里。从小就给地主作帮工，没吃的，没穿的，也没有钱上学读书。1949年当我十七岁的时候，党和毛主席的军队解放了我的家乡，才把我从世世代代受压迫的地位解放出来。我的生活也就渐渐好起来。同时参加了工作。1955年起担任了乡党总支书记和团总支书记。可是在1957年兴修水利运动中，发生了一件不幸的事：我带头在一段悬岩上点炮，因躲避不及，眼球被炸药炸坏，双目失明了。
    眼睛瞎了，不能直接看到上级的指示和文件，工作多了一层困难，我觉得非加强学习不可。我相信，只要很好学习毛主席的思想，就是眼睛看不见，也能搞好工作。于是我便托人买了“毛泽东选集”，决心好好学下去。我学习的办法是，请别人给我念，我仔细听。
    两年来，我学习了毛主席写的“中国社会各阶级的分析”、“关心群众生活、注意工作方法”、“愚公移山”、“反对自由主义”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“关于农业合作化问题”以及“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”、“马恩列斯论共产主义社会”和“论人民公社”中的一部分、党的八届八中全会文件、“中国共产党章程”、“论共产党员的修养”、“怎样做一个共产党员”等。
    在学习中，我每听完毛主席的一篇或一段文章以后，就认真地拿毛主席的话来对照检查我的工作和思想。我对“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”这篇文章学的遍数最多，体会也深一些。我记得毛主席说，真正的铜墙铁壁是群众。“我们对于广大群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题，就一点也不能疏忽”。这就使我想到在这以前，我们注意了组织群众搞生产，而对于群众的生活问题是注意得不够的。集体食堂虽然办起来了，但饭菜单调，天天吃一样的饭，一餐只有一个菜。社员吃饭又没有饭厅。学习了毛主席的这些指示后，我立即下定决心办好食堂，先把自己刚建的三间房子让出来做食堂饭厅，自己一家十一口人住在两小间旧房子里。接着，又亲自下食堂当主任，把炊事员和部分党、团员组织成一个“食堂营养研究组”。我就和大家一起研究饭菜的营养和多样化问题。在研究中，发现原来做菜的时候，放水过多，煮的时间过长，既失去了营养，又不好吃。研究后，就改变做法。同时，增加七、八种炒菜。在做饭方面，既有蒸饭、炒米饭等，还利用代食品做出了十多种好吃的饭。这些饭菜很受社员欢迎。我们的食堂也越办越好，越来越巩固，被评为全县标兵食堂。
    毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”文章中还说：群众的住房问题，穿衣问题，生小孩的问题等都要解决。这些话也深深感动了我。我想，毛主席关心群众这样周全，我是党支书，但往往认为这些问题是私人的小事情不大去管。经过学习毛主席这段话后，知道了全面关心群众生活的重要性，我才动员队干部把自己多余的房子让出来给新搬来的社员住，解决了搬家社员的住房问题。冬天天气很冷，有的社员穿着很单薄的衣服在田里干活，我就按毛主席说的办事，马上召集管理区干部开会研究，帮助衣服单薄的社员穿上了棉衣。因此，社员很满意，说：“这真是我们的好当家人。”
    没有学习毛主席的著作以前，我对农村的阶级斗争还认识不清，认为公社化后，大家都是社员了，只要搞好生产就行了。对地、富、反、坏分子有些失去警惕，对少数富裕农民的歪风邪气也认识不清。有一次，我正在县里开会，乡里发生了一件事，就是土匪连长杨和先的老婆和高级社主任杨再才互相殴打起来，杨和先就到处叫喊说，“社干部打群众，这是现刑犯”，煽动群众把杨再才捆绑送到乡里来。我开完会回去后，想这件事有点不对劲，就从抽屉里拿出书来，请人给我念“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，毛主席在文章里面说：“在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”还说，对敌人要进行坚决镇压；对人民内部的问题要根据团结——批评——团结的原则，进行说服教育。听完了这两段话以后，我就想：杨再才一向工作很积极，和群众的关系也很好，就是有时有些急躁，他并没有反抗社会主义革命和敌视破坏社会主义建设，怎么能把他关起来呢？又想到杨和先一贯对合作化不满，他和老婆经常破坏生产。两人一比较，又对照毛主席的话，越想越感到不对头。就及时召开干部和群众会进行讨论，经群众检举、揭发，才弄清了事件的真实情况。原来是杨和先有意叫老婆去找杨再才吵闹、打架，才发生殴打。事情查清楚了，该逮捕的却是杨和先。通过这件事情，我深深体会到，只有经常学习毛主席的著作，才能在阶级斗争的大风浪中，辨清风向，站稳立场，处理好问题。在后来的工作中，听什么人说话，我都看他是什么阶级，说的话对哪个阶级有利，这样我对各种言论就比以前分辨得清楚了。
    我的眼睛虽然失明了，但是毛泽东思想给了我一双锐利的眼睛，它使我对生产上、工作上的许多问题，比以前看得更清楚，更明白。只要我活着，我就要为党的事业奋斗到底。
