Anti-American Chinese Laborer Exclusion Literature Selection

The Plight of the Chinese Laborer (New Yuefu Poem)
	Wang Weicheng

	The Chinese laborer is in pain, the Chinese laborer is in pain, confined by heaven and earth with nowhere to voice their grievances. In the past, they were invited to open up a new world, brought here to do hard labor. Now that the wilderness has been cleared, they are discarded like worn-out shoes. The soaring birds are gone, so the good bow is put away. The ban on laborers extends to scholars and merchants. When ships arrive at the port, hearts are filled with dread. Customs officers inspect like tigers and wolves, measuring every inch of the body. Doctors examine for disease, causing suffering. Disinfectant is poured on their heads, making them stagger. Even without illness, they freeze. After the examination, they are locked in wooden houses, whipped and cursed like dogs and sheep. Police guard them with guns on their shoulders, and a single wrong word can cost them their lives. Friends cannot be visited, relatives dare not be looked upon. No water to drink, no food to eat, exposed to frost and snow, wandering in wind and rain. Alas! Even black slaves have freedom to come and go, yet only we Chinese are subjected to such poison. My eyes tear as I speak, my hair stands on end and my gums bleed. The anger of all under heaven must be vented! Bah! We are all men with round heads, square feet, and upright blood, why are we subjected to such humiliation? To suffer humiliation without retaliation is not the act of a patriot. Patriots raise their voices in a call, and the weak and weary rise up in arms. Boycott, boycott, compatriots pledge together; if the exclusion act is not changed, the boycott will not stop. If we do not resist this, we are worse than dogs and pigs, better to die!

    反美华工禁约文学选
    华工苦（新乐府）
    王维城
    华工苦，华工苦，跼天促地无门诉。当年欲辟新鸿蒙，招之使来作苦工。此时荜路山林启，挥之使去如敝屣。高鸟已尽良弓藏，禁工波及士与商。轮船到埠心惶惶，关员查检如虎狼。支节四体寸寸量，医生验疫都遭殃。药水当顶浇跄踉，纵无疾病也冻僵。验毕闭置木屋内，鞭笞呼叱若犬羊。警察监守肩荷枪，一言不合命随伤。朋友不能顾，亲族不敢望。欲饮无浆，欲饭无粮，霜欺雪虐，风雨傍徨。吁嗟乎！黑奴来去尚自由，肆毒惟我华人当。我言至此眦勿裂，发上冲兮齿龈血，普天之愤誓一泄。咄！同是圆颅方趾昂然血性好男子，胡为受辱乃如此，受辱不报非志士。志士登高一声呼，懦夫奋臂疮疲起。抵制抵制，同胞共矢；禁约不改，抵制不止，此而不抵制，真乃狗彘不若不如死！
