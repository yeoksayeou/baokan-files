Xinhua News Agency, June 6th—The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in the capital, after achieving great victories in the continuous rise of production in the first five months of this year, are now launching a comprehensive high-yield movement with high output, high quality, high efficiency, and low consumption as its main contents. They aim to complete and overfulfill half of the annual plan in terms of total output value, especially in the output of major products, in the first half of the year, laying the foundation for completing and overfulfilling the annual plan this year.

In the first five months of this year, Beijing's industrial production rose month by month, continuing its great leap forward. Cumulatively, the total industrial output value for the five months has completed more than half of the state plan. The output of steel and pig iron has reached more than half of the state's annual plan, and the output of steel products, raw coal, cement, and machine tools has also completed more than 42% of the annual plan or approached half of the annual plan. The output of these major products has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The quality of many products continues to improve, costs continue to decrease, more than 2,800 new products have been successfully trial-produced, and the total labor productivity in the first four months has increased by more than 40% compared to the average for the whole of last year. Many units have also made progress in the work of producing raw materials through "small indigenous groups" and "small modern groups."

At the industrial conference held on the 1st and 2nd of this month, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed this excellent situation and pointed out that the current task on the industrial front is to launch a comprehensive high-yield movement, proactively overcome weaknesses in the work, and lead the masses to advance victoriously. Emphasis should be placed on grasping four key aspects: (1) Elevating the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new stage of widespread popularization, great improvement, and large-scale success; (2) Vigorously launching a movement to increase production and economize on raw materials; (3) Greatly improving enterprise management; and (4) Focusing on transportation, especially in-plant transportation.

Regarding the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Municipal Party Committee pointed out that it is necessary to focus on the key issues in the comprehensive high-yield movement, vigorously promote effective advanced experiences and innovation projects, taking promotion as the key, and focusing on mastering, consolidating, promoting, and improving.

The Municipal Party Committee pointed out that diversified operations and comprehensive utilization are the main directions for increasing production and economizing on raw materials. Diversified operations mainly involve managing the production of raw materials. Under the principle of self-reliance and prioritizing the completion of outward transfer tasks, "small indigenous groups" and "small modern groups" should be used to produce whatever is lacking. However, this should be done in a planned and divided manner, operating in areas that others have not explored, areas that everyone can operate in, and areas that one is capable of operating in. Comprehensive utilization mainly involves using coal, wood, and waste materials such as wastewater, waste gas, and waste residue. It is necessary to utilize what others have not utilized or have not fully utilized, and not squeeze others' sources of raw materials. In addition, it is necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements to save raw materials, rationally use raw materials, and reduce raw material consumption.

The Municipal Party Committee also pointed out that as a result of the technical revolution, many new problems have emerged in the production and technical management of enterprises. This situation urgently requires the formulation and unification of new operating procedures and process regulations, and urgently requires strengthening the maintenance, repair, and manufacture of spare parts for equipment, and establishing systems and strictly enforcing them. In addition, the Municipal Party Committee has also instructed all units to earnestly strengthen the inspection of product quality; strengthen planning management and quota management of raw materials; and strengthen safety production and dust prevention, heatstroke prevention, and cooling measures.

In addition, the Municipal Party Committee also requires production departments and transportation departments to strengthen cooperation and launch a high-yield transportation movement.

This deployment by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has now become the active action of the broad masses of workers on the city's industrial front. Under the slogan of "Completing and Overfulfilling Half of This Year's Plan Within This Month," factories and mines across the city are holding various meetings to formulate new goals and specific measures.

People's Daily, Shanghai, July 7th—The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Shanghai, after winning a double leap forward in production and technical revolution in the first five months of this year, have launched a new high tide of fighting hard in June to strive for the comprehensive completion of half of the state's annual plan for this year. In the nearly one week at the beginning of June, a large number of factories have overfulfilled their production plans every day, and the results of many technical innovations and technical revolutions have been rapidly promoted and applied to production, laying a good foundation for continued leaps forward in production in the future.

After breaking the usual pattern of first-quarter production being lower than fourth-quarter production in previous years, the production in Shanghai in April and May leaped forward even further. By the end of May, the city's industrial output value for the five months had increased by 65.9% compared to the same period last year, and more than 300 factories had completed half of the annual output value plan ahead of schedule.

In order to achieve a substantial increase in production in June, Shanghai's industrial leadership departments made comprehensive arrangements as early as the end of May, paying particular attention to the production of steel, steel products, and other raw materials, as well as the manufacture of mining and transportation equipment. Leading cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and district committees of the Communist Party of China often spoke to cadres of various factories, analyzing the favorable conditions for achieving continued leaps forward in June. At the same time, they devoted a considerable amount of time to going down to factories to help factories solve production difficulties. Districts, industrial bureaus, and many factories have taken measures to strengthen leadership over production. Almost all factories in Putuo District have implemented the June plan down to the workshop, team, and individual levels; 102 factories have proposed to complete half of this year's plan five to ten days ahead of schedule.

Currently, factories in all industries are continuing to focus on the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovations and technical revolutions, targeting weaknesses in production, so that a large number of innovation projects can quickly blossom and bear fruit in production. The Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory organized four large-scale consolidation and promotion efforts in May, enabling more than 70 innovation projects to play a role in production, and completed 50.57% of the annual plan by the end of May. At the beginning of June, the factory launched a mass campaign of large-scale inspection, large-scale summarization, and large-scale improvement, which not only put more than 20 previously unused innovation projects into production, but also proposed 40 new innovation projects. The Fachang Machine Factory needs to make a significant leap forward in June, and feels that manpower and equipment are insufficient. On the basis of having already achieved single-machine automation in the previous period, the factory further promoted the advanced method of multi-machine management. Now, it not only operates one more shift than in the past, but also draws some surplus manpower to manufacture equipment.

With the continuous development of the technical revolution, the call of "one person equaling several" put forward by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has been realized in more and more factories and workers. The miscellaneous parts team of the second metalworking workshop of the Dalong Machine Factory used to have a quota of more than 20 pieces per person per day for processing mud pump screw caps. Sun Fengying, an advanced producer in the city, took the lead in improving the tools and speeding up the lathe, and the output jumped to 130 pieces, achieving a production efficiency of one person equaling five people. Another female lathe operator, Sheng Judi, quickly caught up and created a new record of 145 pieces per day, achieving one person equaling six. Then, Sun Fengying created an even higher record of 198 pieces, achieving one person equaling eight. Now, among the 32 workers in this section, 90% have reached the level of one person's production efficiency equaling two people, and some have even reached one person equaling eight people.

    乘大好形势鼓更大干劲上半年完成全年计划一半
    北京上海决心实现六月份大幅度增产
    北京大抓技术革命、原材料、管理和运输等环节
    上海及早做好安排，干部下厂帮助解决生产问题
    据新华社6日讯　首都工业战线上的广大职工，在取得今年头五个月生产节节上升的伟大胜利后，现在又掀起了一个以实现高产量、高质量、高效率、低消耗为主要内容的全面高产运动，要在总产值特别是在主要产品的产量方面，在上半年内完成和超额完成全年计划的一半，为今年完成和超额完成全年计划奠定基础。
    今年头五个月，北京工业生产月月上升，持续跃进。五个月累计，工业总产值已完成国家计划的一半以上。钢、生铁的产量已达到国家全年计划的一半以上，钢材、原煤、水泥、机床的产量也都完成全年计划的42％以上或接近全年计划的一半。这几种主要产品的产量都比去年同期有了大幅度的增长。很多产品的质量不断提高，成本不断降低，新产品已试制成功二千八百多种，头四个月的全员劳动生产率比去年全年平均提高了40％以上。不少单位大办小土群、小洋群生产原料材料的工作，也取得了进展。
    中共北京市委在本月1、2两日举行的工业会议上，讨论了这种大好形势，指出工业战线上当前的任务，就是要开展一个全面的高产运动，主动积极地克服工作中的薄弱环节，以领导群众乘胜前进。要着重抓住四个环节：（一）把技术革新和技术革命运动提高到大普及、大提高、大面积丰收的新阶段；（二）大搞原料、材料的增产节约运动；（三）大力改进企业管理工作；（四）大抓交通运输特别是厂内运输。
    关于技术革新和技术革命运动，市委指出，要围绕全面高产运动中的关键问题，大力推广行之有效的先进经验和革新项目，以推广为纲，大抓掌握、巩固、推广、提高。
    市委指出多种经营、综合利用，是原料、材料增产节约运动的主攻方向。多种经营主要是要经营原料、材料的生产，在自力更生和首先完成外调任务的原则下，用“小土群”“小洋群”的办法，缺什么就生产什么。但是要有步骤、有分工，要经营别人没有经营的，经营大家都可以经营的和自己能够经营的。综合利用主要是利用煤、木材以及废水、废气、废渣等废物，要利用别人没有利用和没有充分利用的东西，不要挤别人的原料来源。此外，要大力开展节约原料材料、合理使用原料材料和降低原料材料消耗的群众运动。
    市委又指出，开展技术革命的结果，在企业的生产和技术管理上出现了很多新问题，这种情况急需制定和统一新的操作规程和工艺规程，急需加强设备的维护检修和备品备件的制造，并订出制度，严格执行。此外，市委还责成各单位要切实加强产品质量的检验工作；加强计划管理和原料材料的定额管理工作；加强安全生产和防尘、防暑、降温等工作。
    此外，市委还要求生产部门和运输部门加强协作，开展一个运输高产运动。
    中共北京市委的这个部署，现已成为全市工业战线上广大职工的积极行动。全市各厂矿企业在“本月份内完成和超额完成今年计划一半”的口号下，正召开各种会议，制订新的奋斗目标和各项具体措施。
    本报上海7日电　上海工业战线上的广大职工，在大战今年头五个月，取得生产、技术革命双跃进的胜利后，又掀起一个大战6月份，力争全面完成国家今年全年计划一半的生产新高潮。在6月初近一周中，大批工厂每天都超额完成生产计划，许多技术革新和技术革命的成果，迅速地推广运用到生产中去，为今后生产继续跃进打下了良好基础。
    上海工业战线上的职工在打破历年一季度生产低于四季度的常规后，四、五两个月的生产又进一步向前跃进。到5月底止，全市五个月的工业产值比去年同期增长了65．9％，有三百多家工厂提前完成年度产值计划的一半。
    为了实现6月份大幅度高产，上海各工业领导部门早在5月底作了全面安排，特别对钢、钢材和其它原材料的生产，以及采矿、运输等设备的制造，抓得更紧。中共上海市委、区委的领导干部，经常向各厂干部大讲形势，分析6月份实现继续跃进的有利条件，同时，抽出相当多的时间下厂，具体帮助工厂解决生产上的困难。各区、各工业局和许多工厂都采取措施，加强了对生产的领导。普陀区差不多所有的工厂都已把6月份的计划落实到车间、小组和个人；有一百零二个工厂提出要提前五天到十天完成今年计划的一半。
    目前，各行各业的工厂都针对生产上的薄弱环节，继续大抓技术革新和技术革命的巩固、推广和提高工作，使大批革新项目迅速在生产上开花结果。上海耐酸搪瓷厂在5月份接连组织了四次大巩固、大推广的工作，使七十多项革新项目在生产上发挥了作用，5月底完成了全年计划的50．57％。6月初，这个厂又开展群众性的大检查、大总结、大提高，不但使原来没有使用的二十多个革新项目投入了生产，而且又提出了四十个新的革新项目。发昌机器厂6月份要大幅度跃进，人力设备都感到不足，厂里在前一个时期已经实现单机自动化的基础上，进一步推行多机台管理的先进方法，现在不但比过去多开了一班，而且抽出了一部分多余人力去制造设备。
    随着技术革命的不断发展，中共上海市委提出的“一顶几”的号召，已在越来越多的工厂和工人中实现。大隆机器厂第二金工车间杂件工段加工泥浆泵的螺丝帽，原来定额是每人每天生产二十多只，市先进生产者孙凤英一马当先，改进了刀具，加快了车速，产量一跃而达到一百三十只，做到了一人的生产效率顶五人；另一女车工盛菊娣急起直追，创造了每天生产一百四十五只的新纪录，实现了一顶六；接着孙凤英又创造了一百九十八只的更高纪录，做到了一顶八。现在这个工段的三十二个工人中，已有90％达到了一人的生产效率顶二人的水平，有的甚至达到一人顶八人。
