    Skillfully Fight the First Battle for Increased Rice Production
    Suzhou Prefectural Committee Correspondence Group, Suzhou Special District County Committees Correspondence Group
    The agricultural production in Suzhou Special District is showing an excellent situation. From the shore of Taihu Lake to the south bank of the Yangtze River, yesterday was still a thousand miles of wheat turning into golden waves, and today it is a green canopy covering the fields of Jiangnan. More than five million mu of rice in the entire district has been transplanted quickly and well.

      Even Three Points More Detailed Than Embroidery
    Rice planting in Suzhou Special District has always been known for its meticulousness. This year, it is even more detailed and striving for perfection. The masses describe this year's rice transplanting as "even three points more detailed than embroidery."

    Various important key measures for rice planting in Suzhou Special District this year have a set of specifications and a set of procedures. The requirements are so high and the items so precise that they are unprecedented in previous years. Connecting these procedures is a very systematic rice cultivation study book for 1960. For example: carefully selecting good seeds to suit local conditions, planting fertilizer-tolerant seeds in fertile fields, and planting flood-resistant seeds in low-lying areas; treating seeds as if selecting treasures; rice seedling cultivation has sixteen procedures; rice transplanting is even stricter, with ten "no transplants" and five "seedling supplements"; fertilizer accumulation involves three turnovers and four combinations, and the quality of grass pond mud must meet the four standards of red, black, smelly, and rotten. Not only is the quality good, but the amount of base fertilizer in the paddy fields has doubled compared to last year, reaching more than 200 dan per mu; leveling the fields is like leveling the seedling fields, and the quality of seedling transplanting exceeds that of the large fields; in the past, processing was done half a month after transplanting, but now the rice is processed as soon as it turns green five or six days after transplanting, and fertilizer is immediately applied after processing, and so on. Chen Lao Er, an old farmer in Xishiqiao Commune, Jiangyin County, is a well-known farming expert in the surrounding areas. He has never praised others for farming well, but this year he was also convinced. He said, "The commune's farming is getting more and more detailed, and the younger generation is better than the older generation."

      Secretary Visits Rice Transplanters
    One evening in mid-May, Jiang Yuanwen, the First Secretary of the Kunshan County Party Committee, inspected rice transplanting work in Zhengyi Commune and found that the large fields waiting for transplanting on both sides of the Su-Tai (Suzhou to Taicang) Highway were still just reflecting the evening glow with white water. This shows that the large fields have been prepared, but the transplanting has not kept up. He was very anxious and immediately discussed with Jiang Zhenzhong, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, who was in charge of the work here, and decided that Jiang Zhenzhong should go deep into the fields, pig farms, and canteens to visit and tap the potential of rice transplanters. In the morning, Jiang Zhenzhong arrived at Team 1 of the Shuguang Brigade and saw that there were more than forty people leveling the fields, but only five people transplanting rice. He found that the method of leveling the fields was not correct. Instead of straightening the old field ridges, they destroyed all the old field ridges and rebuilt new ones, which took a lot of work and occupied the labor force for rice transplanting. Secretary Jiang said to Wang Meisheng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, who was accompanying him, "This is a great potential, and people can be saved to transplant rice." While talking, he passed a pig farm in the field and saw six strong laborers building a new pigsty. Secretary Jiang ran up and asked Wang Yunxiang, a commune member who was building the pig shed, "Can you transplant rice seedlings?" Wang Yunxiang said, "How can farmers not transplant rice seedlings? All six of us can transplant rice seedlings." Jiang Zhenzhong then asked the brigade cadre standing beside him, "How many people in your brigade are engaged in sideline production?" Bu Jinhe, the Secretary of the Brigade Party Branch, said, "There are a total of twenty-four people." Wang Meisheng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, interjected, "Can you go transplant rice seedlings first, and then concentrate on building the pig farm in a few days?" Those commune members said, "We are very anxious when we see that the team is very busy. As long as we are assigned to transplant rice seedlings, we will definitely go." That day at noon, the construction of the pig shed was stopped, and Comrade Bu Jinhe, the Secretary of the Brigade Party Branch, assigned these six people to participate in rice transplanting and carrying rice seedlings. Jiang Zhenzhong saw many activities in this brigade, and the more he saw, the more he felt that the potential of rice transplanters was great. After overall arrangement, five rice transplanting experts were drawn from the seven canteens in the entire brigade to transplant, and twelve people were drawn from the sideline production team to help with rice transplanting. The leveling of the fields also changed to a new method, straightening the old field ridges, saving 80% of the labor compared to the original plan for leveling the fields. The Commune Party Committee promoted this experience to the entire commune, and the number of rice transplanters in the entire commune increased from more than 1,100 to 3,398, which accelerated the speed of rice transplanting and improved the quality.

  The Deciding Factor for High Speed ​​is the Rice Transplanter
    In the large-scale rice transplanting, the deciding factor for high speed ​​is still the rice transplanter. When Ouji Commune in Changshu County promoted rice transplanters, they first selected "Rice Transplanting Kings" from among the rice transplanting experts, and then asked the rice transplanter operators to compete with the "Rice Transplanting Kings". In the first competition, Ge Guibao, a female rice transplanter operator who had just been trained, lost to Qian Guanren, the "Rice Transplanting King", in terms of speed and quality. Ge Guibao was not discouraged. With the support of the Party, she and a carpenter improved the Liling No. 2 rice transplanter. After the rice transplanter was improved, she practiced day and night, using grass instead of seedlings. The commune members said, "This little girl is like falling in love with a young man, and she can't live without this rice transplanter." In the second competition, the "Rice Transplanting King" Qian Guanren transplanted more than 800 holes of rice seedlings in ten minutes, and was so tired that he was sweating all over; the rice transplanter operator Ge Guibao's expression did not change, and she transplanted more than 1,500 holes of rice seedlings in ten minutes, and the quality was better than Qian Guanren's. Qian Guanren straightened up and sincerely said, "Thank you for the Party's good leadership. I will also use machines in the future." The rice transplanters were promoted, and in the fields, the rice transplanter operators sang while transplanting: Rice transplanter, really good, from now on rice transplanting straightens the back, a burst of mountain songs has not ended, a piece of green seedlings welcomes the east wind with a smile....

    Due to the efforts of cadres and the masses in the entire district to carry out tool reforms and vigorously promote rice transplanters, more than 300,000 mu of early rice in the entire district were transplanted before the Beginning of Summer, and more than 1.6 million mu of mid-season rice were transplanted before the Grain in Ear, both about five days earlier than in previous years.

        Lean Fields Leap to Heaven
    The land in Suzhou is relatively fertile, but it is also very uneven. Every commune and every brigade has some lean fields. Lean fields are relics of the small-scale peasant economy and decentralized management. Now these lean fields must compete for high yields and surpass fertile fields. Let's see how people are calling "Lean fields flying to heaven": Mao Xingyuan, the Secretary of the Mao Xu Brigade Branch of the Shipai Commune in Kunshan, led the team members to apply fertilizer equivalent to 500 dan of grass pond mud per mu to 160 mu of low-lying fields that had not been fertilized for eighteen years. The South Corner Dike of Miaogang Commune in Wujiang County was originally a pot-bottom field. Now, standing on the South Corner Dike and looking out, red flags are waving in the wind, and people are processing and spreading fertilizer in the early rice seedlings..., which is better than embroidery; squares of green seedlings are lush and dripping. Here, no one can tell whether it was originally a low-lying dike or barren soil. Who is fighting here to transform nature? Only a wooden sign erected at the entrance of the dike reads a few lines of fist-sized characters: "Establish lofty ambitions and exert great efforts, break superstitions about conditions, make further efforts to strive for the upper reaches, and let the low fields jump up ten floors." Below is the name of the Youth Commando Team for Transforming the South Corner Low-Yield Dike of the Communist Youth League July 1st Brigade. It is this youth commando team that, under the leadership of the Party branch, has set lofty ambitions, mustered soaring enthusiasm, and carried out large-scale land leveling on the low-lying land with a height difference of two feet, using eight mud-dredging boats to transport soil, put the raw soil at the bottom, and covered the surface with mature soil, leveling the fields as smooth as a mirror and connecting them into one piece, applying 300 dan of fertilizer per mu.

    Changing lean fields has become a common cause. Changshu County supported the lean field team with more than 2,000 boats. The No. 1 Brigade of Baimao Commune has more fertile fields, and the No. 11 Brigade has more lean fields. Digging mud to accumulate fertilizer used to be a common "Little Three Jing" river, and disputes often arose over the competition for fertilizer in the past, which was known as the "Enemy Jing". After communization, an agreement was reached to dig half of the mud each, and it was renamed "Concentric Jing". Now, the No. 1 Brigade supports the No. 11 Brigade's lean fields to fly to the sky, and all the "Concentric Jing" is given up, and the new name is called "Happiness Jing".

  High-Yield Plots Lead the Way to Seize High Yields
    While calling for lean fields to fly to the sky, we are also vigorously developing high-yield plots. Throughout the entire summer planting, counties, communes, and teams vigorously developed high-yield fields. Some counties' high-yield plots account for 45% of the total area, and some account for 70%. County, commune, and team high-yield fields are linked up and down, connected left and right, and carry out competitions. Once there is action in the high-yield plots, the large fields closely follow. Jiang Yuanwen, the First Secretary of the Kunshan County Party Committee, personally selected good seeds one by one in the command field, along with the office cadres and commune members; when plowing the soil, he personally participated in plowing and harrowing, left and right, pounding the mud as fine as powder. The command field of the First Secretary of the County Party Committee was harrowed so well, and the command fields of many Commune Party Committee Secretaries did the same. On the day of rice transplanting in Secretary Jiang Yuanwen's command field, he still felt cold wearing a cotton-padded jacket. He went barefoot into the field with the old rice transplanters to transplant rice seedlings.

    Now, the summer planting battle is still going on intensely. More than 3 million cadres and masses in Suzhou Special District, full of lofty ambitions to reach a higher level, are determined to seize even greater victories on the basis of two consecutive years of leap forward.

    巧打水稻增产第一仗
    苏州地委通讯组、苏州专区各县委通讯组
    苏州专区的农业生产是一派大好形势，从太湖之滨到长江南岸，昨天还是千里麦子翻金浪，今天便是绿盖江南满田秧。全区五百多万亩水稻插得快、插得好。
      还比绣花细三分
    苏州专区栽插水稻素以精细著称，今年更是细中有细，精益求精。群众形容今年插秧“还比绣花细三分”。
    苏州专区各地今年水稻栽插的各项重要关键措施都有一套规格，一套工序。要求之高，项目之精，历年来都是没有的。把这些工序衔接起来，就是一本叙述十分系统的1960年的水稻学。例如：精选良种做到因地制宜，耐肥的种在肥田，耐涝的种在洼地；处理种子时选种如选宝；育秧有十六道工序；插秧更严格，有十不插、五补棵；积肥有三翻手、四搭配，草塘泥质量要搞到红、黑、臭、烂四标准，不光是质量好，稻田基肥在数量上比去年增加一倍，每亩二百多担；大田平地如秧田，秧田插秧质量又赶过大田；过去插秧后半个月才加工，现在插秧后五、六天稻子一返青马上加工，加工一结束马上追肥，等等。江阴县西石桥公社有个老庄稼汉陈老二，是名闻方圆十里的种田能手，生平没有赞扬过别人种田好，今年也折服了，他说：“公社种田越种越细，老一辈的不如小一辈的了。”
      书记走访插秧手
    5月中旬的一个傍晚，昆山县委第一书记姜元文在正仪公社检查插秧工作，发现苏太（苏州到太仓）公路两旁等待插秧的大田还是白水映着晚霞。这说明大田是整理好了，插秧还没有跟上来。他看了心里非常焦急，立即和在这里掌握工作的县委书记处书记姜振中商量，决定由姜振中深入田头、猪场、食堂访问，挖掘插秧手的潜力。早晨，姜振中到了曙光大队一小队，看到整田的人有四十多个，插秧的人只有五个，他发现整田的方法不对头，没有在旧田埂的基础上裁弯取直，而是把旧田埂全部破坏，重做新田埂，因此花工很大，占用了插秧的劳力。姜书记对同行的公社党委第一书记王梅生说：“这是一个很大潜力，可以省出人来插秧。”边说边走，路过田头猪场，看到六个强劳力正在搭建一座新猪舍，姜书记跑上去问搭猪棚的社员王云祥说：“你们会不会莳秧？”王云祥说：“种田的人还不会莳秧吗？我们六个人，个个会莳秧。”姜振中又问站在他身旁的大队干部说：“你们大队搞副业的有多少人？”大队党支部书记卜金和说：“一共是二十四人。”公社党委第一书记王梅生插话说：“你们能不能先去插秧，过几天再来突击建猪场？”那些社员说：“我们看到队里很忙，心里也很急，只要分配我们去插秧，一定去。”当天中午，就停止建猪棚，大队党支部书记卜金和同志分配这六个人参加莳秧和挑秧把的农活。姜振中在这个大队看到很多活动，越看越觉得插秧手的潜力很大。经过通盘安排，全大队七个食堂抽出五个莳秧能手插栽，副业队抽出十二人去帮助莳秧。整田工作也换了新的方法，在旧田埂基础上裁弯取直，比原来整田的计划节省了80％的劳力。公社党委把这个经验推广到全社，全社插秧手从一千一百多人增加到三千三百九十八人，加快了栽秧速度，并提高了质量。
  决定高速度的是插秧机
    在大面积水稻栽插中决定高速度的还是插秧机。常熟县藕渠公社在推广插秧机的时候，先在插秧能手中选出“莳秧王”，然后再要插秧机手和“莳秧王”比武。第一次比武，初经训练的女插秧机手戈桂宝，在速度、质量上都输给了“莳秧王”钱关根。戈桂宝毫不灰心，在党的支持下，她和木工一起，把醴陵二号插秧机加以改进。插秧机改良过后，她抽清早，摸黄昏，以草代秧，日夜练习。社员说：“这个小姑娘像爱上了小伙子一样，离不开这部插秧机了。”第二次比武时，“莳秧王”钱关根十分钟插秧八百多穴，累的汗湿全身；插秧机手戈桂宝神色不变，十分钟插了一千五百多穴，质量还比钱关根插得好。钱关根直起腰来，衷心折服地说：“感谢党的好领导，今后我也要使用机器了。”插秧机推广开来了，田野里，插秧机手们边插边唱：插秧机，真正好，从今插秧直了腰，一阵山歌音未了，一片绿苗迎着东风笑……。
    由于全区干部群众大搞工具改革，大力推广插秧机，全专区三十多万亩早稻，于立夏前插完，一百六十多万亩中稻，于芒种前插完，都比往年提早五天左右。
        瘦田一步登天
    苏州的土地是比较肥沃的，但也很不平衡。每一个公社，每一个大队，都有一些瘦田。瘦田是小农经济分散经营的遗迹，现在这些瘦田要争高产，要超肥田，且看人们是怎样叫“瘦田飞上天”的：昆山石牌公社毛许大队支部书记毛兴元带领队员给一百六十多亩十八年没有施过肥的低洼田每亩施肥相当于草塘泥五百担。吴江县庙港公社的南角圩，原是锅底田，现在登上南角圩圩埂极目望去，一面面红旗迎风招展，人们在早稻苗丛中，加工、撒肥……，胜似绣花；一方方绿苗青翠欲滴。这里谁也难辨明它原是洼圩，还是瘠土。谁在这里战斗，改造大自然？只见矗立在进圩口的木牌上，写着几行拳大的字：“树立雄心鼓大劲，打破迷信条件论，再鼓干劲争上游，低田跳上十层楼”。下面署名是共青团七一大队改造南角低产圩青年突击队。就是这一支青年突击队，在党支部的领导下，立下雄心大志，鼓足冲天干劲，在高低相差二尺的洼地上，大搞平整土地，用八只拖泥船运土，把生土运在底层，熟泥盖了面，整得田平如镜，连成一片，每亩田施下肥料三百担。
    改变瘦田已成为共同的事业，常熟县支援船只给瘦田队的就有二千多条。白茆公社一大队肥田多，十一大队瘦田多，罱泥积肥合用一条“小三泾”河，过去为争肥常常闹纠纷，人称“冤家泾”。公社化后协议各半罱泥，改称“同心泾”，现在一大队支援十一大队瘦田飞上天，全部让出“同心泾”，新名字已叫“幸福泾”。
  丰产方带头
    夺高产
    一边要叫瘦田飞上天，一边又大搞丰产片。在整个夏种中，县县、社社、队队，大搞丰产田。有的县丰产片占总面积的45％，有的占70％。县、社、队丰产田，上下挂钩，左右联系，开展比武竞赛。丰产片里一有行动，大田就紧紧跟上。昆山县委第一书记姜元文在种指挥田里，和机关干部、社员们一起，亲自一粒一粒精选良种；翻土的时候，他又亲自参加犁田耙田，左一遍、右一遍，捣得泥细如粉。县委第一书记的指挥田耙得这么好，许多公社党委书记的指挥田也同样做。姜元文书记那块指挥田莳秧的那天，穿着棉袄还觉冷，他赤脚和老莳秧手们一起下田莳秧。
    现在，夏种战斗还在紧张地进行。苏州专区三百多万干部群众，满怀更上一层楼的雄心大志，决心在连续两年跃进的基础上，夺取更大的胜利。（附图片）
