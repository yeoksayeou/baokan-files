Cadres and Members Eat Together and Manage Together
Chengdong Team's Canteen is Well-Run

(Reported by this newspaper) The Chengdong Team Party Branch of the Tongjun Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang, focuses on both production and livelihood, helping the canteen to establish a solid foundation through self-reliance, diversifying meals, ensuring that members eat their fill and eat well, and saving money. The better the canteen is run, the greater the enthusiasm of the members, which effectively promotes various productions.

The Chengdong Canteen was established in July 1958. Now, more than 540 people eat in this canteen. It has 29 mu of scattered odd land. The public canteen uses this scattered odd land to grow vegetables and fodder, with considerable income. This not only allows members to eat enough fresh vegetables every day, but also pickles some dried vegetables and pickles, solving most of the fine and coarse feed for the pig farm. In addition, some vegetables are surplus and can be sold. The canteen also used the money from selling vegetables to build ten pig houses and set up a livestock farm, which now raises 204 pigs and some sheep and rabbits; it also built a poultry farm and a fish farm, which now raises more than 400 chickens and ducks and more than 12,000 fish; in addition, it has purchased a large number of vats, buckets, bowls, basins and other utensils, and even complete sets of tools. The vegetables grown in this vegetable farm are not only large in quantity, but also diverse in variety, currently including potatoes, amaranth and 25 other kinds.

The Chengdong Canteen is well-run, primarily because the production team's Party branch attaches importance to the leadership of the public canteen, grasping the members' livelihood as it grasps production. From the day the canteen was established, all six cadres and twenty-five Party members in the team have been dining in the canteen, eating and working alongside the members, humbly listening to the members' opinions, and actively helping the canteen to improve its operations and improve the quality of meals. At the same time, in the selection of canteen cooks and managers, the principle of "resolutely relying on poor and lower-middle peasants" was resolutely implemented. All five cooks and two canteen managers in the canteen are activists from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds.

In the early days of the public canteen, it only supplied rice but not vegetables. The members felt it was inconvenient and affected attendance, and they urgently demanded that the public canteen supply vegetables. In order to solve this problem, the Party branch immediately convened a meeting of members, revealing the situation to the masses and organizing everyone to study and discuss methods of improvement. During the discussion, the vast majority of members unanimously proposed that the public canteen should establish vegetable bases and develop vegetable production and other non-staple food production, such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., so that it could supply both rice and vegetables; at the same time, it should improve management and plan grain use. According to the members' requirements, the Party branch, on the one hand, helped the canteen formulate a detailed plan for saving grain, and on the other hand, mobilized the members to help the canteen use all available land to develop vegetable production and establish vegetable bases. A few months later, it not only ensured that the members ate enough fresh vegetables, but also pickled dried vegetables and pickles. The canteen also used some of the surplus vegetables for sale to exchange for non-staple foods such as tofu, vermicelli, and salted fish to increase the variety of side dishes and improve the members' lives. After the bumper spring flower harvest last year, in order to adjust the members' appetites, the canteen used new wheat to make many kinds of pastries. However, because there were many people eating and few cooks, they were often too busy. After Party branch secretary Chen Xigen discovered this situation, he immediately studied solutions with the cooks. Based on the members' suggestions, they began to try to make noodle-making machines and cake-making machines. After a few days of effort, they successfully trial-produced a cake oven that could bake 60 jin of wheat cakes at a time. The work efficiency was increased by more than 20 times, adding six kinds of rice spot styles.

The main experiences of the Chengdong Canteen in establishing a family property through self-reliance: (1) Organizing professional teams and establishing a responsibility system. Developing vegetable production and establishing a canteen family property is a major event in running a public canteen well. In order to do a good job in this major event, the Party branch selected ten members who had good ideology, were active in production, and had experience in growing vegetables to form a vegetable professional team. (2) Intercropping and interplanting to increase the multiple cropping index. They set aside 30% of the land to specifically grow cabbage and radishes, implementing year-round intercropping, which can be planted nine to ten times a year; the rest of the land is generally interplanted with different varieties. As a result of implementing intercropping and interplanting, the unit area yield was greatly increased. Generally, each mu of vegetable land can produce 30,000 jin to 40,000 jin of vegetables a year, and the highest can reach more than 70,000 jin.

    干部跟社员一起吃饭共同经营
    城东小队食堂办得好
    本报讯　浙江桐庐县桐君公社城关生产队城东小队党支部一手抓生产，一手抓生活，帮助食堂自力更生建立了雄厚的家底，做到饭菜多样化，保证社员吃饱吃好并且省钱。食堂越办越好，社员干劲越来越大，有力地推动了各项生产。
    城东食堂是在1958年7月份办起来的。现在，在这个食堂吃饭的有五百四十多人。一起有二十九亩零星杂地。公共食堂利用这些零星杂地，种植蔬菜和饲料，收入相当可观。不仅使社员天天能吃到足够的新鲜蔬菜，腌制了一部分干菜和咸菜，解决了养猪场的大部分精、粗饲料，而且还有一部分蔬菜多余，可以出售。食堂还利用出售蔬菜的钱兴建了十间猪舍，办起了一个畜牧场，现在饲养着二百零四头猪和一部分羊、兔；兴建了家禽场和鱼场，现在养着四百多只鸡鸭和一万二千多尾鱼；此外，还置办了一大批缸、桶、碗、盆等用具，连成套工具等。这个蔬菜场种的菜，不仅数量多，而且品种也多，当前就有洋芋、苋菜等二十五种。
    城东食堂办得好，首先是由于生产小队党支部重视对公共食堂的领导，像抓生产一样地抓社员的生活。从建立食堂这一天起，全队六个干部和二十五个党团员就全部在食堂用膳，和社员同吃、同劳动，虚心倾听社员意见，积极帮助食堂改进经营，提高饭菜质量。同时，在选拔食堂炊事员和管理人员时，坚决贯彻执行了“坚决依靠贫农和下中农”的原则，食堂的五个炊事员和两个食堂管理员，全部是贫农和下中农积极分子。
    公共食堂开办初期，只供应饭，不供应菜，社员感到既不方便，又影响出勤，迫切要求公共食堂供应菜蔬。为了解决这个问题，党支部立即召开社员大会，向群众交底，组织大家研究、讨论改进的方法。在讨论中，广大社员一致提出：公共食堂要建立蔬菜基地，发展蔬菜生产与其他副食品生产，如养猪、鸡、鸭等，做到既供应饭，又供应菜；同时要改进管理，做到计划用粮。党支部根据社员的要求，一方面帮助食堂制订出详细的节约用粮计划，一方面发动社员帮助食堂利用一切可以利用的土地发展蔬菜生产，建立了蔬菜基地，几个月以后，不但保证社员吃到了足够的鲜菜，而且还腌制了干菜、咸菜。食堂还利用自给有余的一部分多余蔬菜出售，换回豆腐、粉条、咸鱼之类的副食品，增加小菜的花色品种，改善社员生活，去年春花丰收以后，食堂为了调济社员的胃口，利用新麦做出了许多种面点。但是由于吃饭的人多、炊事员少，往往忙不过来。党支部书记陈锡根发现这一情况后，立即和炊事员一起研究解决办法，根据社员建议着手试制摇面机和制饼器，经过几天努力，试制成功一台一次能烘六十斤麦饼的烘饼炉以后，工效提高二十多倍，增加了六种饭点的花式品种。
    城东食堂自力更生建立家底的主要经验：（1）组织专业队，建立责任制。发展蔬菜生产，建立食堂家底，是办好公共食堂的大事。党支部为了办好这件大事，抽调了思想好、生产积极、有种菜经验的社员十人，组成蔬菜专业队。（2）套种间作，提高复种指数。他们拿出30％的土地专门种白菜和萝卜，实行全年间作，一年可种九次到十次；其余的土地，普遍实行不同品种的套种。实行套种间作的结果，大大提高了单位面积产量，一般每亩菜地一年能产蔬菜三万斤到四万斤，最高的达到七万多斤。
