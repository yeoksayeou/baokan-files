This newspaper reports: Changle County, Fujian Province, uses farmers' spare-time schools as a base to teach health knowledge to the masses.

With the improvement of the masses' cultural level and the in-depth development of pest elimination and disease control work, the masses in Changle County universally demand to learn health science knowledge. In addition to medical personnel and school teachers giving health lessons to commune members, various localities universally use farmers' spare-time schools as a base, closely combining workers' and peasants' spare-time education with the popularization of health knowledge. The education is easy to understand and easy for the masses to accept, achieving both the learning of health knowledge and the consolidation and review of cultural lessons. Due to the utilization of the organization, equipment, teachers, and a complete set of experiences of spare-time schools in adhering to learning throughout the year, health knowledge education is regular and sustained. At present, among the county's two hundred and thirty-six people-run schools and one thousand five hundred and seventy classes, 70% of the schools and classes have opened health courses. 70% to 80% of the county's young and middle-aged people have basically mastered the elimination of the four pests, as well as the transmission routes and prevention knowledge of common diseases, through learning.

In the popularization of health knowledge education, when encountering the difficulty of insufficient teachers, they adopted a method of combining county and commune health centers with farmers' spare-time schools, and a major collaboration between medical personnel and civil teachers, through "learning, teaching and improving at the same time," to train the original spare-time school teachers to take on the teaching work of health knowledge courses.

Various localities regard the production team's teacher's spare-time refresher schools as health knowledge transmission stations, with medical personnel from the county and commune health stations regularly giving lectures in the transmission stations, organizing teachers to systematically study and improve. Now, all of the county's more than twenty-seven thousand teachers, through training, can generally undertake the teaching work of health courses.

Changle County's development of health knowledge education with farmers' spare-time schools as a base has improved the cultural level of the broad masses and enriched their health science knowledge. Many areas have achieved that everyone has a towel and toothbrush. Everywhere is clean, and there are fruit peel boxes, trash cans, sputum cups, etc. on the streets. Spitting anywhere and not paying attention to hygiene have been regarded as disgraceful things by people. The broad masses have developed hygienic habits, and diseases have also been greatly reduced. The incidence of diseases has decreased year by year, and in the recent months, it has dropped by half compared to the same period last year, with an incidence rate of only 8.7 per 100,000. Due to fewer diseases and the good health of the people, the attendance rate for production and work throughout the county is often above 98%.

    长乐县利用业余学校普及卫生知识
    本报讯　福建省长乐县以农民业余学校为阵地，向群众讲授卫生知识。
    长乐县随着群众文化水平的提高和除害灭病工作的深入开展，群众普遍要求学习卫生科学知识。各地除了由医务人员和学校教员给社员们上卫生课外，普遍以农民业余学校为阵地，把工农业余教育和普及卫生知识紧密结合起来，教育通俗易懂，群众易于接受，作到既学了卫生知识又巩固复习了文化课。由于利用了业余学校的组织、设备、师资以及一整套常年坚持学习的经验，卫生知识教育作到经常持久。目前，全县二百三十六所民校、一千五百七十个班级中，已有70％的校、班开设了卫生课。全县70％至80％的青壮年，通过学习基本上掌握了除四害以及常见疾病的传染途径和防治常识。
    在普及卫生知识教育中，碰到师资不足的困难，他们采取县、社卫生保健站和农民业余学校相结合、医务人员和民师大协作的办法，通过“边学边教边提高”，培养原来业余学校的教师担任卫生常识课的教学工作。
    各地把生产队的教师业余进修学校作为卫生知识传授站，由县、社保健站的医务人员定期到传授站里讲课，组织教师系统学习提高。现在，全县所有的二万七千多名教师，通过培养，一般已能担任卫生课的教学工作。
    长乐县以农民业余学校为阵地开展卫生知识教育，使广大群众提高了文化水平，丰富了卫生科学知识，许多地区都作到人人有毛巾、牙刷。到处都是干干净净，街上设有果皮箱、垃圾箱、痰盂等，随地吐痰、不讲究卫生已被人们认为不光彩的事了。广大群众养成了讲卫生习惯，疾病也大大减少。疾病发生率逐年下降，最近几个月又比去年同期下降了一半，发病率只有十万分之八点七。由于疾病少，人们身体健康，全县生产、工作的出勤率经常在98％以上。
