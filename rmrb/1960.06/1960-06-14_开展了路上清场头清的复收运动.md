    Launched a Campaign to Glean Fields, Roadsides and Threshing Grounds

    Our commune basically completed the summer harvest work by the end of May, about ten days earlier than in the past, and the harvesting and threshing were also more meticulous. The commune has a large estate, and if the harvesting and threshing are not meticulous, losing one jin of grain per mu will result in losing several thousand or tens of thousands of jin of grain across several thousand or tens of thousands of mu. In order to ensure that every grain is stored in the granary, after the summer harvest, the commune Party committee organized more than 5,000 children and elderly people in our commune to adopt methods such as picking in the fields, gleaning on the roads, and sweeping the threshing grounds, launching a campaign to clean the fields, clean the roadsides, and clean the threshing grounds. From May 30th to June 3rd, in five days, a total of 37,651 jin of wheat, 2,534 jin of broad beans, and 9,120 jin of rapeseed were picked up and swept up, and 47,651 jin of wheat straw, 22,514 jin of broad bean stalks, and 37,500 jin of rapeseed stalks and pods were recovered.

    We think that if every commune launches a second harvest and threshing campaign, it will definitely be a considerable income.

    开展了路上清场头清的复收运动
    我们公社5月底基本上完成了夏收工作，比过去提早大约十多天，收打也比较精细。公社家业大，如果收打不细致，一亩地丢一斤粮，几千亩上万亩地就要丢几千斤上万斤粮。为了做到颗粒归仓，公社党委在夏收结束以后，我们公社组织了五千多名少年儿童和老年人，采取田中拾、路上拣、场头扫等办法，开展了一次田头清、路上清、场头清的复收运动。从5月30日到6月3日五天中，共拾到扫到麦子三万七千六百五十一斤，蚕豆二千五百三十四斤，油菜籽九千一百二十斤，并拾回麦柴四万七千六百五十一斤，蚕豆秸二万二千五百一十四斤，菜籽秸和荚壳三万七千五百斤。
    我们想，如果每个公社都来一个复收复打运动，一定会是一笔不小的收入。
