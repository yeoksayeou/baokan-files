Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 8th. Correspondent Xu Xuezeng reports: The Fujian front soldiers and civilians described the incident of hitting and damaging Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Jiang-class" warship: On the afternoon of June 4th, huge waves rolled on the sea off the coast of Weitou area, and clouds drifted in the sky. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships妄想 attempted to take advantage of this bad weather to secretly approach our Weitou area to carry out reconnaissance and harassment activities. However, the enemy warship did not escape the eyes of our alert soldiers. A battle alarm sounded on our position: "American imperialism is again directing Chiang Kai-shek to provoke, open fire!"

    In an instant, the artillerymen made all preparations to open fire. Shells roared towards the enemy warship as the commander gave the order. At this time, Hong Peide, deputy battalion commander of the militia who was working in the field, and militia heroes Hong Jiancai and Wu Qiuhong, who had attended the National Militia Congress, led the militia to participate in the artillery battle. The militiamen felt at home when they arrived at the position. They very skillfully worked with the artillerymen to wipe shells, install fuses, and carry shells. Some even asked to be gunners and personally strike the enemy warship hard.

    After a fierce battle, the clouds and smoke on the sea mixed together. In the smoke, shells exploding on the deck of the enemy warship could be seen, bursting with flashes of light. Subsequently, plumes of black smoke rose from the enemy warship. The enemy warship, like a wounded beast, fled to Kinmen in a panic.

    A burst of victorious cheers erupted on the artillery position. The participating militia and artillery soldiers congratulated each other. They said: "This is a victory for the joint combat of the soldiers and civilians on the front line."

    挑衅者逃不脱人民战士的惩罚
    蒋贼“江字号”军舰被我痛击狼狈逃窜
    新华社福建前线8日电　本社记者徐学增报道：福建前线军民击伤蒋贼“江字号”军舰的经过说：6月4日下午，围头地区海面上巨浪翻滚，天空中云雾飘动。蒋贼军舰妄想乘这恶劣的气象，偷偷地接近我围头地区进行侦察骚扰活动。但是，敌舰没有逃脱过我机警战士的眼睛，在我阵地上响起战斗的警报：“美帝国主义又指使蒋介石来挑衅，开炮！”
    霎时间，炮兵们作好一切开炮的准备。炮弹随着指挥员的口令，怒吼着向敌舰轰击着。这时，正在田里干活的民兵副营长洪培德和曾出席全国民兵大会的民兵英雄洪建才、吴秋红等带领着民兵，前来参加炮战。民兵们到了阵地就像到家一样，他（她）们非常熟练地和炮兵们一起擦炮弹、上信管、搬炮弹，有的还要求当炮手，亲手痛打敌舰。
    经过一场激烈战斗，大海上的云雾和硝烟交融在一起，在烟雾中，可以见到爆炸在敌舰甲板上的炮弹，迸发着闪闪的火光。随后，一股股的黑烟柱，从敌舰上冒起来。敌舰像一只受了重伤的野兽，狼狈地向金门逃去。
    炮兵阵地上，响起了一片胜利的欢呼声。参战的民兵和炮兵战士互相祝贺。他们说：“这是前线军民共同作战的胜利。”
