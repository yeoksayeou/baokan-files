Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Nobusuke Kishi government is plotting a counterattack before its resignation, aiming to suppress the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on a large scale.

According to today's "Yomiuri Shimbun" report, Nobusuke Kishi's Minister of Transport, Wataru Narahashi, and Japanese National Railways President, Shinji Sogou, held a joint meeting yesterday of the Ministry of Transport and Japanese National Railways authorities, deciding to punish more than 1,000 union leaders of the National Railway Workers' Union who held strikes to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." This includes dismissing National Railway Workers' Union Chairman Chuzaburo Yoshida, National Locomotive Engineers' Union Chairman Mamoru Kurumada, and more than ten chairmen of local branches who led the patriotic struggle.

The newspaper revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government is preparing to announce the list of punished workers at the end of this month or the beginning of next month.

The Japanese National Railway Workers' Union was the main force in Japan's four general strikes. The Nobusuke Kishi government's decision to suppress this strong union is a barbaric infringement on the rights of the Japanese working class and a new fascist attack on the Japanese people.

According to reports, the Nobusuke Kishi government is also planning to punish all workers in government agencies and public enterprises who participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

At a meeting of its executive committee on the 23rd, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided that it will fully counter the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot of illegal suppression, and will hold workers' rallies throughout the country on July 2nd. On the same day, a rally of 300,000 workers will be held in Tokyo to protest the Nobusuke Kishi government's illegal suppression of workers.

Eira Nuka, Director of Education and Publicity Department of the National Railway Workers' Union, published a statement in today's "Yomiuri Shimbun," strongly condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot to punish National Railway workers. He said that the struggle of the National Railway workers is a sharp expression of the Japanese people's anger towards the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, who are trampling on democracy. This struggle represents the will of all the people. If the National Railway authorities dare to punish the workers, the huge people's force united in the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" will thoroughly crush it.

Mamoru Kurumada, Chairman of the National Locomotive Engineers' Union, also published a statement in the same day's "Yomiuri Shimbun" saying: We will unite with all the people to launch a struggle and force the Nobusuke Kishi government to cancel the plan to punish the workers.

    岸政府阴谋大规模镇压人民爱国斗争
    总评决定举行三十万人抗议大会
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：在美帝国主义指使下，岸信介政府阴谋在它下台以前进行反扑，大规模镇压日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国斗争。
    据“读卖新闻”今天报道，岸信介政府的运输相楢桥渡和国营铁道总裁十河信二昨天举行运输省和国营铁道当局联席会议，决定要处罚一千多名为反对批准新“安全条约”而举行罢工的国营铁道工会干部。其中包括解雇国营铁道工会委员长吉田忠三郎、国营机车工会委员长车田守和领导展开爱国斗争的地方分会的委员长十多名。
    报纸透露，岸信介政府准备在本月底或下月初公布受处罚的工人的名单。
    日本国营铁道工会是日本四次总罢工中的主力军。岸信介政府决定镇压这个坚强的工会，是对日本工人阶级的权利的横蛮侵犯和对日本人民的新的法西斯进攻。
    据报纸透露，岸信介政府目前还策划处分参加反对“安全条约”斗争的所有政府机关和公共企业的工人。
    日本工会总评议会在23日举行的干事会会议上决定，它将全力反击岸信介政府非法镇压的阴谋，并将在7月2日在全国各地举行工人大会，当天还要在东京举行有三十万工人参加的大会，抗议岸信介政府非法镇压工人。
    国营铁道工会教育宣传部长额贺英良今天在“读卖新闻”上发表谈话，强烈谴责岸信介政府处罚国铁工人的阴谋。他说，国营铁道工人的斗争是日本人民针对践踏民主的岸信介内阁和自由民主党的怒火爆发的尖锐表现，这个斗争代表着全体人民的意志，如果国营铁道当局胆敢对工人进行处罚，团结在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的巨大的人民力量必将彻底粉碎它。
    国营机车工会委员长车田守也在同一天的“读卖新闻”上发表谈话说：我们将团结全体人民展开斗争，迫使岸信介政府取消处罚工人的计划。
