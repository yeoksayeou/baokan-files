Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 27th: According to Indian newspaper reports, workers in various parts of India are holding strikes and demonstrations to protect their basic rights and interests.

The strike by a thousand fleet sailors in Bombay Port, India, entered its fifth day on the 27th. They are striking to protest the Bombay Port Trust Authority's refusal to reinstate six dismissed workers, as demanded by the sailors.

According to the Press Trust of India, on the 27th, more than two hundred strikers demonstrated in front of the Bombay Port Trust office, shouting slogans against the Indian government's order prohibiting further strikes.

The five-day strike has already paralyzed shipping in this major Indian commercial center. According to the "Hindustan Times," a total of fifty-four ships were forced to stop in the port on the 27th, halting shipping.

The Indian government intervened on the 26th, ordering a ban on the sailors' strike and suggesting that the dispute be submitted to arbitration. However, the union announced on the 27th that it would continue the strike, regardless of the government's decision.

According to newspaper reports, the "Joint Action Committee," representing 2.2 million employees of Indian central government agencies, has also decided to hold a strike starting on July 11th.

The committee includes employees belonging to union organizations such as the All India Railwaymen's Federation, the Confederation of Central Government Employees, the National Federation of Postal and Telegraph Employees, and the All India Defence Employees' Federation. They are demanding that price allowances be linked to the cost of living index; that a needs-based minimum wage standard be implemented; and that their existing rights not be curtailed. They made these demands in the context of rising prices earlier this year. To achieve these demands, they formed the "Joint Action Committee" in April of this year. However, the government has so far refused these demands.

According to the Press Trust of India, central government employees, including railway workers and postal and telecommunications workers, held parades and demonstrations in major cities across the country on the 25th to support their demands.

In a resolution issued on the 24th, the committee expressed its regret at Prime Minister Nehru's refusal to meet with representatives of the committee. The resolution said that the government's "failure to stabilize prices" had greatly reduced the real wages of employees.

Nehru said at a press conference on the 24th that his government was not prepared to modify the recommendations of the Pay Commission to accommodate the demands of the employees.

According to the Press Trust of India, in Seerpore, an industrial town about 170 miles from Hyderabad, police clashed with a thousand workers on the 25th. Workers used stones to smash the jeep carrying government officials. When batons and tear gas failed to disperse the crowd, police opened fire, killing two and injuring six.

    反对物价上涨　争取　合理工资
    印度中央政府二百多万雇员决定罢工
    孟买水手不顾政府禁令坚持罢工塞浦尔警察打死打伤八名工人
    新华社新德里27日电　据印度报纸报道：印度各地工人举行罢工、示威，为保护工人的基本权利和利益而斗争。
    印度孟买港的一千名船队水手举行的罢工，27日已经进入第五天。他们举行罢工，是为了抗议孟买港口托辣斯当局拒绝水手们提出的将六名被解雇的工人复职的要求。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，27日，有二百多名罢工者在孟买港口托辣斯办事处门前示威，高呼口号，反对印度政府下令禁止继续罢工。
    五天的罢工已经使得这个印度主要商业中心的航运瘫痪。据“印度斯坦时报”报道，在27日一共有五十四艘船被迫停在港内，停止航运。
    印度政府在26日曾经出面干涉，下令禁止水手罢工，并建议把纠纷提付裁决。但是工会在27日宣布不顾政府决定，继续罢工。
    据报纸报道，代表印度中央政府所属机构二百二十万雇员的“联合行动委员会”也决定从7月11日起举行罢工。
    这个委员会包括有印度全国铁路员工联合会，中央政府雇员联合会，全国邮电职工联合会和全印军需职工联合会等工会组织所属职工，他们要求把物价津贴同生活费用指数连系起来；实施以需要为基础的最低限度的工资标准，不削减他们现有的权利等。他们是在今年年初物价上涨的情况下提出这些要求的。为了实现这些要求，他们在今年4月成立了“联合行动委员会”。但是政府迄今一直拒绝这些要求。
    据印度报业托辣斯消息，中央政府雇员包括铁路工人和邮电工人，25日曾在全国各地重要城市举行游行示威，以此来支持他们的要求。
    委员会在24日发表的一项决议中对尼赫鲁总理拒绝接见委员会代表的态度表示遗憾。决议说，政府“未能稳定物价”，已经使雇员的实际工资大为减少。
    尼赫鲁24日在记者招待会上说，他的政府不准备修改薪给委员会的建议来迎合雇员们的要求。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在离海得拉巴约一百七十英里的工业市镇塞浦尔，25日警察曾经同一千名工人发生冲突。工人曾用石头砸政府官员坐的吉普车。当警棍和催泪弹无法驱散人群时，警察开枪镇压，结果有两人被打死，六人受伤。
