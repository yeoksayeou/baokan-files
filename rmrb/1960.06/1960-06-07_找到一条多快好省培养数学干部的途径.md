    Find a Way to Cultivate Mathematical Cadres Quickly, Effectively, and Economically
    Representative of the Mathematics Department of Fudan University, Gu Chaohao
    Since March of this year, under the leadership of the Party, the Mathematics Department of Fudan University has launched a mass movement for teaching reform. Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the faculty and students of the entire department exposed a series of contradictions in the past teaching content and teaching system, and began to establish a new system of mathematics teaching, initially finding a way to cultivate mathematical cadres quickly, effectively, and economically. Now, I would like to give you a brief report on the situation of this movement, and I ask for your comments and corrections.
    Breaking Through Many Old Conventions in Mathematics Teaching
    Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the faculty and students of our entire department are increasingly eager to advance rapidly on the road of being both red and expert. In the first spring of the 1960s, the situation is infinitely beautiful, and China's socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds towards modernization; industrial and agricultural production has achieved a good start, a complete victory, and a colorful scene; the nationwide technical revolution movement is magnificent and powerful, effectively promoting the leap forward of cultural and educational work. In such a great situation, the faculty and students of our entire department are very excited. Everyone is holding this ambition: We must build a teaching system guided by Mao Zedong Thought, reflecting the achievements of modern science, cultivate talents quickly, effectively, and economically, and rapidly climb to the peak of science. In early March, during the National Mathematical Society meeting, we read the suggestions of the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University on the reform of mathematics teaching in primary and secondary schools. This suggestion also gave us great inspiration. In this way, under the leadership of the Party, the faculty and students of the entire department enthusiastically launched the teaching reform movement. This movement broke through many old conventions in teaching work, and put forward the following three requirements for reform:
    The first requirement is that we must greatly enrich the new teaching content in accordance with the needs of socialist construction and the development of modern science. Now is an era of leaping progress in human science. We are faced with the task of conquering outer space, making extensive use of the large amount of energy stored in the atomic nucleus, using machines to replace some of the mental labor, and making huge revolutions in engineering technology. All this puts forward a large number of new requirements for mathematics, and at the same time, it brings a series of brand-new achievements to enrich the content of mathematical science, with the emergence of emerging mathematical departments such as computational mathematics, cybernetics, and information theory. However, the current situation of basic courses in various majors of our school's mathematics department is far from being able to adapt to this situation. Although the teaching content has been continuously changed in recent years, there has been no fundamental change. The content learned by students in basic courses is basically limited to the materials of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. For example, the course of theoretical mechanics is still the content of the era of Newton and Lagrange, and modern materials needed for interstellar navigation and automatic adjustment are not involved at all. Some emerging mathematical departments are not included in the content of basic courses. Because the content of basic courses is too old and narrow, students have to supplement a lot of basic knowledge when they specialize, and modern content is still learned very little. Obviously, this is far from being able to adapt to the needs of the new situation of socialist construction, and it is necessary to generally process the original basic course content and add a large amount of new material reflecting the achievements of modern science.
    The second requirement is to scientifically and reasonably handle the setting and interrelationship of courses, and avoid phenomena such as course repetition, fragmentation, and cumbersome content. In the past, the setting of courses was limited to the old framework of discipline classification formed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The main disciplines corresponding to the scientific development of that era, such as geometry, algebra, and analysis, were strictly separated, and mathematics, mechanics, and physics courses were also unrelated to each other. Much of the content also overlapped with secondary school materials (such as Newtonian mechanics). For example, in order to make analytic geometry a course, many unnecessary contents were added, wasting a lot of class hours. The result of such teaching often makes the knowledge learned by students lack scientific systematicness, and it is not suitable for the development of marginal disciplines, and it cannot meet the needs of studying comprehensive problems. Therefore, it is necessary to reset the courses according to the dialectical relationship between the synthesis and classification of disciplines.
    The third requirement is to guide mathematics teaching and research according to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, and eliminate the viewpoints of being divorced from reality and metaphysics. In the past, the viewpoints of being divorced from reality and metaphysics still had considerable influence in our department's teaching work. Some people could not see the realistic sources of mathematics, one-sidedly emphasized its abstract side, and regarded mathematics as merely the result of axiomatic deduction, appreciating its so-called "pure beauty." In this way, useful content was said to be completely useless (such as part of complex variable functions). The course of mathematical physics equations, due to the one-sided emphasis on rigorous argumentation and the emphasis on the differences between various equations, could only talk about three typical equations in more than seventy class hours, making a lively and practical course with close ties to reality dull, poor in content, and divorced from reality. In teaching, it is often from definition to theorem, from theorem to corollary, with a rigid face everywhere, making it difficult for students to accept and not easy to understand the essence of what is being taught. Some of the content of first-year courses can only be truly understood by students in the third year. Some students, bound by this viewpoint of being divorced from reality and metaphysics, hold incorrect views on mathematics and even social phenomena. After realizing these problems, we urgently demanded to use the weapon of dialectical materialism to re-handle textbooks and establish new teaching methods.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have fundamentally broken down the old teaching system according to these three requirements, and started to build a new mathematical system. According to this new system, the content of basic courses will be completely new. Taking mathematics majors as an example, we have redefined the content of basic courses according to the needs of five aspects: major projects and cutting-edge technology, modern physics, automation, the national economy, and large-scale computing tasks.
    According to the original education plan, the basic courses in mathematics and physics totaled 1243 class hours, and it took three and a half years to complete. The reform plan deleted 310 class hours of old and repetitive content, and the remaining content, after being summarized and updated, can be taught in 497 class hours. In this way, 490 class hours of new content reflecting the needs of socialist construction and the achievements of modern science can be added to the basic courses. All basic courses can be completed in three years (if some of the course content is transferred to secondary schools, the time can be reduced), so that students have more time to participate in labor, technical revolution, and solving mathematical problems in production practice, and have at least two years to engage in specialized learning and scientific research, so that the students trained greatly exceed the level of current graduates.
    After such processing, in the new curriculum system, four new courses such as "Computational Mathematics" and "Mathematical Logic and Cybernetics" have been added; the content of seven courses such as statistical mathematics and general mechanics has been greatly changed, and most of the new content in these courses accounts for more than half; the original basic courses have also undergone great changes after being summarized, updated and appropriately merged, such as analytic geometry, mathematical analysis (1), and mathematical analysis (2), which have been merged into mathematical analysis (1). In this way, basic courses can be roughly divided into three categories: one category is basic mathematical knowledge, such as mathematical analysis and algebra; one category is physics and mechanics courses; and one category is mathematics courses closely related to the above five aspects of major projects and cutting-edge technology, such as mathematical physics equations and statistical mathematics. From this new curriculum system, the modern content newly added in the basic courses to meet the needs of socialist construction accounts for half, the purpose of each course is clearer, and the connection between the courses is also strengthened.
    According to the requirements of the teaching reform plan and the new education plan, teachers and students have also compiled teaching outlines and new textbooks for 19 courses. These newly compiled textbooks have been repeatedly revised four times before they were completed, and they have now been published one after another.
    At present, we have started to conduct experiments in some classes. Preliminary results show that the effect is good. The students all feel that teaching according to the new textbooks and teaching methods avoids repetition, improves efficiency, and makes it easier for students to grasp the essence. The progress of complex variable functions is carried out at a rate of twelve weeks catching up with eighteen weeks. But the students feel that it is easier than learning mathematical analysis in the past. We conducted an unannounced temporary test on twenty students, and as a result, seventeen people got four or five points. At the same time, in order to deepen the teaching reform, more than 600 teachers and students went to factories to participate in the technical revolution or engaged in solving mathematical problems in production practice, so that the technical revolution, teaching, scientific research, and productive labor were closely integrated, so that the training of mathematical talents was not only reading behind closed doors, but also closely combined with production practice activities. Now, the teachers and students in the department are full of confidence and are striving to further deepen the teaching reform.
    The reason why this movement has progressed relatively quickly and has had relatively significant results is due to the following four characteristics: Mao Zedong Thought Takes Command in Natural Science
    First of all, this movement has been carried out under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought from beginning to end. At the beginning of this semester, in studying Chairman Mao's works, teachers and students deeply realized the extremely important significance of Mao Zedong Thought taking command in natural science. Everyone brought Chairman Mao's works to the studio, and whether it was the program discussion group or the textbook writing group, they were also Mao Zedong Thought study groups. No matter how busy the work was, everyone insisted on studying for one or two hours every day. When encountering difficulties in work, they read works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," which greatly encouraged their fighting spirit. When encountering problems that could not be understood, they studied articles such as "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," which opened up the road forward. For example, when compiling textbooks, some teachers originally thought that as long as they gave some examples related to application, they would have embodied the spirit of theory linked to practice. However, after studying "On Practice," they realized that all knowledge comes from production activities, and social practice is the standard for the truth of knowledge. They clarified that the object of mathematical research is precisely the quantitative changes and relationships of things in the real world, and the important significance of mathematics lies in its ability to guide people to correctly grasp these laws, so as to correctly solve many complex problems in engineering technology and modern science. Therefore, they made up their minds to work hard to write mathematics textbooks starting from the source and needs of practice. For the introduction of some important concepts and problems, they strived to explain its realistic source; for the main theorems, they were not limited to formal argumentation, but paid attention to explaining the essence it reveals; for each course, they strived to reflect the relationship between them, and worked hard to write out the practical significance of the content of the textbooks, thus thoroughly changing the original appearance of the textbooks. Some comrades said that every step of our progress was achieved after studying Chairman Mao's works.
    Closely Combined with the Technical Revolution Movement from Beginning to End
    Second, this movement has been carried out under the impetus of the technical revolution movement from beginning to end, and it has been closely combined with the technical revolution movement. In the technical revolution, the working comrades were full of enthusiasm and infinite wisdom. Many factories and enterprises turned over in a few days, changing the backward state of production technology and realizing mechanization and automation. These facts, on the one hand, prompted us to break superstitions and liberate our minds; on the other hand, they also made us feel more deeply that teaching must be reformed in order to keep up with the requirements of this revolutionary development. In the movement, more than 400 teachers and students in the department went to factories to participate in the technical revolution, and the remaining teachers and students were also engaged in solving mathematical problems in production practice. Since the end of March, we have done a lot for the technical revolution movement and actual production: under the cooperation of various parties, we have completed 527 technical innovation projects and solved 485 mathematical problems in actual production, totaling 1012 items. Some projects have greater significance in terms of technology, theory, and economy. Because teachers and students have been tempered in the technical revolution movement, their ideological outlook is changing every day, and the scope of knowledge is also expanding every day. These have a very profound impact on the curriculum system, teaching content, and teaching methods. In the process of participating in the technical revolution movement, teachers and students have become clearer about the relationship between mathematical theory and practice. Everyone deeply felt that the knowledge of mechanics and physics was insufficient in the past. Therefore, continuous medium mechanics was strengthened in the new curriculum system, and materials such as pipeline flow were added. Many high-order partial differential equations were encountered in actual problems, and this aspect of content was also added to mathematical physics equations. Many courses have also undergone multi-faceted investigations and research when determining the content. For example, when compiling general mechanics textbooks, many secondary vocational schools, industrial universities, factories, and even observatories were visited. Through participating in production practice, students' professional level has rapidly improved. Students in the mechanics group cooperated with workers from the Zhonghua Shipyard, and after more than 300 experiments, they finally completed such a complex equipment as the application of cold and heat exchangers, which can reduce the temperature of the workshop and has many other uses. At the same time, they have come into contact with many mechanics problems, which have great value for further research in theory. Students in the mathematical physics equation group, when solving a series of practical problems, comprehensively grasped the theory of non-uniform anisotropic elastic plates, created a variety of effective methods with universal significance, and the design unit suggested that the results be written into a monograph for publication. These facts powerfully illustrate that practice is an important way to cultivate talents. Therefore, it is stipulated in our new education plan that production internships will be available from the first grade, and participation in the technical revolution will be required throughout the five-year study period, closely combining the technical revolution with teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.
    Widely Mobilize the Masses, Break and Build Simultaneously, with Building as the Main Focus
    Third, the movement adopted the approach of widely mobilizing the masses, breaking and building simultaneously, with building as the main focus, in the spirit of active construction. From plan to outline, from outline to textbook, from textbook to experiment, to revising the education plan, to promoting overall work, the spirit of continuous revolution was implemented, deepening and improving step by step. In the process of revising the education plan and compiling textbooks, we have discovered many problems more deeply. Taking the influence of being divorced from reality and metaphysical viewpoints in mathematics as an example, if we had not compiled textbooks, our understanding of the problems would not have been able to deepen. In the movement, the enthusiasm of teachers and students was very high, and the combination of teachers and students was very good. Many students, because they deeply felt the suffering of being slow, less, poor, and wasteful in the past, urgently demanded reform, and first proposed initiatives for those problems that had not been solved for a long time, and immediately began to act. For example, students in the second mathematics class not only exposed a large number of contradictions in the teaching content of physics courses, but also immediately took action, and teachers and students combined to compile textbooks together. Many teachers also felt dissatisfied with the situation of being slow, less, poor, and wasteful in their own courses and the phenomenon of theory being divorced from reality, and took the initiative to be with the students to expose the contradictions of these courses. Old teachers also participated in the movement and engaged in the construction of a new teaching system. They discussed and compiled textbooks with the students. The textbooks compiled by the students were finally reviewed and finalized by teachers with cultivation in teaching.
    Summarized and Developed the Achievements of the Great Educational Revolution
    Finally, this movement is based on all the work since the Great Education Revolution in 1958, and it summarizes and develops the achievements of the Great Education Revolution. Since the Great Education Revolution, the teaching work of the Mathematics Department has been continuously reformed, and teachers and students have created a lot of experience in teaching. These reforms have laid a good foundation for this movement, and they have also shown that thorough reforms in teaching are not only completely necessary, but also completely possible. Especially in the second half of 1959, after the spirit of the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed, two weeks of labor were generally added to each grade, and the teaching tasks of nine weeks were completed in only seven weeks. In this semester, continuing to carry forward the spirit of being more, faster, better, and more economical, and under the impetus of the teaching reform, six of the eight basic mathematics courses completed the tasks one month to one and a half months ahead of schedule, and the quality was improved. There is a lot of experience here. For example, the completion of the teaching tasks of mathematical analysis in the first grade six weeks ahead of schedule is to summarize the content, grasp the main problems in the course content, highlight the key points, and pay attention to the interrelationship between the content; many teachers of specialized courses can teach the content they have explored and mastered for many years to students in half a year, because they have used a higher point of view to summarize these materials. Many ideas and measures in this teaching reform plan are based on such teaching practice and are promoted.
    In recent years, we have also made relatively rapid progress in scientific research, the construction of new disciplines, and the training of teachers, which has also prepared favorable conditions for further advancement. Before the Great Education Revolution in 1958, we only had one teaching major and six disciplines, and the scope was very narrow. Now we have three majors: mathematics, mechanics, and computational mathematics, and there are twenty-six disciplines such as flat hidden stochastic processes and nonlinear partial differential equations, and their development is generally faster. For example, the mechanics major was all young comrades when it was established, and no one knew mechanics. Now it can offer all the basic courses of the major, such as aerodynamics, and it has also established laboratories for hydraulics, materials mechanics, and aerodynamics. In terms of scientific research, we adhere to and carry forward the experience of mass small-scale scientific discussion meetings, combined with the construction and development of new disciplines. Since 1959, more than 160 scientific research papers have been written. Recently, two collections of papers have been compiled, including more than 70 papers completed since October 1959. Most of these papers belong to the field of new disciplines, and at the same time, they are directly related to teaching problems in production practice. These achievements have created many favorable conditions for the construction of a new teaching system.
    Comrades, under the correct leadership of the Party, although we have made some achievements in teaching reform, teaching reform is a profound revolutionary movement. What we have done is only the first step, and it is far from the requirements of the situation for us. There are still many shortcomings in our work. We are determined to study Mao Zedong Thought in depth, learn from advanced units, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and carry out the teaching reform to the end. We must continue to improve the new education plan and textbooks through experiments, continue to carry forward the new teaching methods, and further closely combine teaching, productive labor, scientific research, and technical revolution. At the same time, we will use teaching reform to drive overall work, vigorously engage in scientific research, actively develop new disciplines and new majors, vigorously train teachers, and strive to quickly establish a new teaching school and climb to the peak of science. Under the current excellent international and domestic situation, we have full confidence. Under the strong leadership of the Party, united with cultural and educational workers across the country, we will hold high the red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought and contribute all our strength in this high tide of economic construction and cultural construction.

    找到一条多快好省培养数学干部的途径
    复旦大学数学系代表　谷超豪
    今年3月份以来，复旦大学数学系在党的领导下开展了教学改革的群众运动。全系师生根据社会主义建设的需要，在毛泽东思想指导下，揭露了过去教学内容、教学体系中一系列的矛盾，着手建立起一个新的数学教学的体系，初步找到一条多快好省培养数学干部的途径。现在，我就这个运动的情况向同志们作一个简单的汇报，请同志们指正。
    冲破数学教学工作中许多旧框框
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们全系的师生越来越迫切地要求在又红又专的大道上迅速前进。六十年代第一个春天，形势无限美好，我国的社会主义建设事业朝着现代化的方向飞跃前进；工农业生产开门红，满堂红，万紫千红；全民性的技术革命运动波澜壮阔，声势浩大，有力地推动了文教工作向前跃进。在这样的大好形势下，我们全系师生精神都很振奋。大家怀着这样的雄心壮志：一定要建设起一个以毛泽东思想为指导的、反映现代科学成就的、理论联系实际的教学体系，多快好省地培养人材，迅速地攀登科学高峰。3月初，全国数学会召开期间，我们读到了北京师大数学系关于中小学数学教学改革的建议。这个建议也给了我们很大启发。这样，全系师生在党的领导下，就热烈地展开了教学改革的运动。这个运动冲破了教学工作中许多旧的框框，提出下面进行改革的三个要求：
    第一个要求是，我们要依照社会主义建设的需要，现代科学发展的情况，大大充实新的教学内容。现在是人类科学在飞跃前进的年代。我们面临着征服宇宙空间的任务，要广泛利用蕴藏在原子核中大量能量，要用机器来代替部分的脑力劳动，要使工程技术进行巨大的革命。这一切都对数学提出了大量的新的要求，同时，也把一系列崭新的成果来丰富数学科学的内容，出现了计算数学，控制论，讯息论等新兴的数学部门。但是，目前我校数学系各专业基础课的情况同这个形势还远远不能适应。最近几年来教学内容虽也不断有所改变，但没有进行根本的变更。学生在基础课程中所学的内容，基本上还限于十七、十八、十九世纪的材料。例如理论力学这一门课程，还是牛顿与拉格仑日时代的内容，星际航行与自动调节所需的现代化材料，根本没有涉及。一些新兴的数学部门，没有列入基础课的内容，因为基础课的内容太陈旧狭窄，学生到读专门化时还要大量地补学基础知识，现代内容仍然学得很少，这样，显然就远远不能适应社会主义建设新形势的需要，必须概括地处理原有基础课内容，大量增加反映现代科学成就的新材料。
    第二个要求是，要科学地、合理地处理课程的设置和相互关系，避免课程重复、割裂以及内容繁琐等现象。过去，课程的设置局限在十八、十九世纪形成的学科分类的旧框框里。和那个时代科学发展状况相适应的主要学科，如几何、代数、分析三方面的课程严格分开，数学与力学、物理课程也都互不连系，许多内容还与中学材料重复（如牛顿力学）。如为了使解析几何作为一门课程，就添上了许多不必要的内容，浪费了大量的学时。这样教学的结果，往往使学生所学的知识缺乏科学的系统性，也不适应发展边缘学科的要求，不能满足研究综合性问题的需要。因此，必须根据学科发展的综合与分类的辩证关系，来重新设置课程。
    第三个要求是，要依据辩证唯物主义的观点，来指导数学的教学与研究，破除脱离实际与形而上学的观点。过去，脱离实际和形而上学的观点在我系教学工作中还有不少影响，有的人看不到数学的现实来源，片面强调它的抽象的一面，把数学看成只是公理演绎的结果，欣赏它的所谓“纯粹的美”，这样，就把有用的内容说得丝毫看不出用处来（如复变函数的一部分）。数理方程这一课由于处处片面强调严格论证，强调各种方程之间的区别，七十多个学时只能讲三种典型的方程，把一门生动活泼的、密切联系实际的课程弄得内容枯燥贫乏，脱离实际。在教学中往往是从定义到定理，从定理到推论，处处是一副刻板的面孔，学生接受困难，不容易懂得所讲东西的实质是什么。有些一年级课程的内容，同学要到三年级才能真正懂得。有些同学受着这种脱离实际与形而上学观点的束缚，对数学甚至对社会现象，也抱有不正确的观点。在认识到这些问题之后，我们就迫切地要求要以辩证唯物主义的武器，来重新处理教材与建立新的教学方法。
    我们在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的指导下，根据这三个要求，从根本上破除了旧的教学体系，着手建设起一个新的数学体系。依照这个新的体系，基础课程内容将要焕然一新。以数学专业为例，我们依据重大工程与尖端技术、现代物理、自动化、国民经济、大量计算任务等五个方面的需要，重新确定基础课程的内容。
    按原教育计划，数学、物理方面的基础课程共有一千二百四十三学时，要三年半才能学完。改革方案中删除了陈旧与重复的内容三百一十学时，余下的内容经过概括更新，可以在四百九十七学时内教完。这样就可以在基础课中添加四百九十学时的反映社会主义建设需要和现代科学成就的新内容。可以在三年内学完全部基础课（如果部分课程内容下放到中学去，时间还可以减少），使学生有更多时间参加劳动，技术革命和解决生产实际中的数学问题，并且有至少两年时间从事专门化学习和进行科学研究，使培养出来的学生大大超过现在毕业生的水平。
    经过这样的处理，在新的课程体系中，添加了“计算数学”、“数理逻辑与控制论”等四门新的课程；对统计数学、一般力学等七门课程的内容作了重大的改变，这些课程新增内容大多占一半以上；原有基础课程，经过概括更新和适当的归并，也有很大的变化，如解析几何，数学分析（一）数学分析（二）等三门课程就合并成了数学分析（一），这样，基础课程大体上就可以分为三类：一类是数学基础知识，如数学分析、代数等；一类是物理、力学课；一类是与上述重大工程与尖端技术等五方面密切相关的数学课程，如数理方程、统计数学等。从这个新的课程体系中看，在基础课中新增的适应社会主义建设需要的现代内容就占了一半，各门课程的目的性更加明确了，各课相互之间的联系也加强了。
    根据教学改革方案和新教育计划的要求，师生们又编写出各门课程的教学大纲和十九门课程新教材。这些新编出来的教材，都经过反复四次修订才完成的，现在已经陆续出版。
    目前，我们已开始在一些班级中进行试验。初步结果表明，效果是良好的。同学们都感到，按新教材、教法进行讲授，避免了重复，提高了效率，容易使学生掌握本质。复变函数的进度是以十二周赶十八周的速度进行的。但同学们感到比过去学数学分析还容易。我们对二十个学生作了一次预先不通知的临时测验，结果，四分、五分的就有十七人。同时，为了深入开展教学改革，六百多师生下厂参加技术革命，或从事解决生产实际中的数学问题，使技术革命、教学、科学研究、生产劳动密切结合，使培养数学人材，也不光是闭门读书，而能密切结合生产实践活动来进行了。现在，系内师生正满怀信心地为进一步深入进行教学改革而奋斗。
    这次运动之所以能够进展比较迅速，效果比较显著，我们的体会，是由于它有着如下的四个特点：毛泽东思想在自然科学中挂帅
    首先，这次运动自始至终，都是在毛泽东思想指导下进行的。本学期初，在学习毛主席著作中，师生们深深地体会到毛泽东思想在自然科学中挂帅的极其重大的意义。大家都带了毛主席著作到工作室来，无论是方案讨论小组或教材编写小组，同时都是毛泽东思想学习小组。无论工作怎样紧张，大家都坚持每天一、两小时的学习。工作中遇到困难，就读“愚公移山”，“星星之火，可以燎原”等等著作，大大地鼓舞了斗志。碰到弄不清楚的问题，就钻研“矛盾论”、“实践论”等文章，打开了前进的道路。例如在编写教材时，有些组的教师原来以为只要举一些与应用有关的例题，就是已体现了理论联系实际的精神了，但他们学习了“实践论”之后，认识了一切知识来源于生产活动，社会实践是认识的真理性之标准，明确了数学研究的对象也正是现实世界中事物的数量的变化关系，数学这门学科的重要意义也就在于它能指导人们正确地掌握这些规律，从而正确地解决工程技术和现代科学中的许多复杂问题。因此，就下决心，努力从实践的来源与需要出发来写数学的教材，对一些重要概念和问题的提出，都力求说明它的现实来源；对于主要定理，都不限于形式的论证，而注意阐明它所揭示的实质；对各门课程，力求反映它们相互间的联系，并且努力写出教材内容的实践意义，因而彻底地改变了原来教材的面貌。有的同志说，我们每一步进展都是学习了毛主席著作后取得的。
    自始至终与技术革命运动密切结合
    第二，这次运动自始至终都是在技术革命运动推动下进行的，并且与技术革命运动密切结合起来进行的。在技术革命中，工人同志们干劲冲天，智慧无穷，许多工厂企业几天翻了身，一改生产技术的落后状态，实现了机械化与自动化。这些事实一面促使我们破除迷信，解放思想；另一面也使我们更深切地感到，教学必须改革，才能跟得上这个革命发展的要求。在运动中，系内师生四百多人下厂参加技术革命，其余师生也在从事解决生产实际中的数学问题。3月底以来，我们为技术革命运动及实际生产做了不少的事：在各方面协作下，完成了技术革新项目五百二十七项，解决了生产实际中的数学问题四百八十五项，两者合计共一千零十二项。有的项目在技术上、理论上、经济上都有较大的意义。由于师生在技术革命运动中受到了锻炼，思想面貌天天在变，知识范围也天天在扩大，这些，无论对课程体系、教学内容、教学方法都起着十分深远的影响。在参加技术革命运动的过程中，师生们对数学的理论与实践的关系更清楚了。大家深感过去力学、物理知识不足，因此，在新课程体系中连续介质力学加强了，并添上管道流动等材料，在实际问题中遇到许多高阶偏微分方程，数理方程中也就添入了这方面的内容。许多课程在确定内容时还经过多方面的调查研究，例如在编写一般力学教材时，就访问了许多中等专业学校、工业大学、工厂以至天文台。通过参加生产实践，同学们的业务水平迅速提高。力学组的同学与中华造船厂工人协作，经过三百多次试验，终于完成了施用冷热器这样复杂的设备，它能降低车间温度，并有很多其他用处，同时接触到很多力学问题，在理论上大有进一步研究的价值。数理方程组同学在解决一系列实际问题时，全面地掌握了非均匀各向异性弹性板的理论，创造多种有普遍意义的有效的方法，设计单位建议把结果写成专著出版。这些事实有力地说明了实践是培养人材的一个重要途径。因此，在我们的新的教育计划中规定，从一年级开始就有生产实习，五年学习期中，自始至终都要参加技术革命，把技术革命与教学、生产劳动、科学研究密切结合起来。
    广泛发动群众，边破边立，以立为主
    第三，运动本着积极建设的精神，采取了广泛发动群众，边破边立，以立为主的做法。由方案到大纲，由大纲到教材，由教材到试验，到修订教育计划，到推动全面工作，贯彻了不断革命的精神，步步深入，步步提高。在修订教育计划、编写教材的过程中，我们就更加深入地发现了许多问题。就以数学中脱离实际和形而上学观点的影响来说，如果不是编写教材，我们对问题的认识也就不能深入下去。在运动中，教师学生积极性都很高，师生结合得很好。许多同学，由于过去学习中深感少慢差费之苦，迫不及待地要求改革，对那些过去长期没有解决的问题首先提出创议，并立即开始行动，如数二同学，不但对物理课教学内容揭露出大量矛盾，而且立即行动，师生结合起来，一起编写教材，许多教师也对自己所任课程中的少慢差费情况和理论脱离实际现象，感到不满，都主动地和同学在一起，揭露这些课程的矛盾。老教师也参加到运动中来，从事新教学体系的建设，他们和同学们在一起讨论，一起编写教材。学生编写的教材，最后都经过教学上有修养的教师审查定稿。
    总结与发展了教育大革命的成果
    最后，这次运动是建立在1958年教育大革命以来的一切工作的基础之上的，它总结与发展了教育大革命的成果。教育大革命以来，数学系的教学工作不断地进行着改革，师生在教学上创造了不少经验，这些改革，为这次运动创立了良好的基础，并且也说明了在教学上进行彻底的改革，不仅是完全必要，也是完全可能的。特别在1959年下半年，在党的八届八中全会决议精神传达后，各年级普遍增加了两周劳动，只用七周时间就完成了九周的教学任务。在这学期中，继续发扬多快好省的精神，又在教学改革的推动下，八门数学基础课中有六门提前了一个月到一个半月的完成任务，并提高了质量。这里有很多经验，例如，一年级的数学分析提前六周完成教学任务，就是对内容进行概括，抓住课程内容中的主要问题，突出重点，并注意内容之间的相互联系；不少专门化课程的教师，能够把自己摸索多年掌握的内容在半年内教给学生，就是因为用了较高的观点总结这些材料的结果。这次教学改革方案中的许多想法与措施，就是建立在这样的教学实践的基础之上，并加以发扬的。
    这几年来，我们在科学研究、新学科建设、师资培养等方面，进展也比较快，这也为进一步前进准备了有利的条件。1958年教育大革命以前，我们只有一个教学专业，六个学科，面都很狭窄。到现在已有数学、力学、计算数学三个专业，有平隐随机过程，非线性偏微分方程等二十六个学科，它们的发展一般是比较快的。例如：力学专业在成立时全是青年同志，没有一个懂得力学的，现在已能开出专业所有的基础课程，如空气动力学等，又已建立了水力学，材料力学，空气动力学等实验室。科学研究方面，我们坚持和发扬群众性的小型科学讨论会的经验，结合新学科的建设与发展，1959年以来已写出科学研究论文一百六十余篇，最近，编出了两本论文集，包括1959年10月份以来完成的部分论文七十多篇，这些论文绝大部分属于新学科领域，同时，又是直接联系生产实际中教学问题的。这些成绩为建设新的教学体系创造了不少有利的条件。
    同志们，在党的正确领导下，在教学改革方面我们虽然取得了一些成绩，但教学改革是一个深刻的革命运动，我们所做的，只不过是第一步，离开形势对于我们的要求还很远，工作中还有很多不够的地方。我们决心深入学习毛泽东思想，向先进单位学习，发扬不断革命精神，把教学改革进行到底。我们要继续通过试验，使新的教育计划，教材不断完善起来，使新的教学方法继续发扬，使教学、生产劳动、科学研究和技术革命进一步密切结合起来。同时以教学改革来带动全面工作，大搞科学研究，积极发展新学科、新专业，大力培养师资，为迅速建立新的教学学派，攀登科学高峰而奋斗。在目前国际国内大好形势下，我们怀有充分的信心，在党的坚强领导下，与全国文教工作者团结在一起，高举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想红旗，在这经济建设与文化建设的高潮中，贡献出我们一切力量。
