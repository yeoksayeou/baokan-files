　　This newspaper reports that after the Fifth Session of the Ninth Enlarged Plenary Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee issued a call to improve work style in April this year, a large number of cadres throughout the province went to the front lines of production, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, participating in production, and leading production. The seven secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee and most members of the Standing Committee went to the grassroots to inspect work. Provincial-level agencies transferred more than 2,500 cadres (including more than 60 department and bureau-level cadres) to work at the grassroots for a long time. Local, municipal, and county party committees transferred 70% to 80% of their cadres to the grassroots. When these cadres went down, they moved their offices and production command posts to the front lines of key communes and key factories. The party committees of various communes have generally promoted the "two-five system" work method.

　　Most of the cadres who went to the front lines of production went to areas with more difficult conditions and more backward work, taking the lead in practical work by setting an example. As a result, the grassroots leadership in these areas has been strengthened and work has greatly improved. Xiushui County organized more than 700 cadres to go to backward areas. On the one hand, they worked as commune members and participated in labor, and on the other hand, they served as leaders of production brigades and teams, leading production. In the past month or so, the work of 51 of the 169 backward teams in the county has caught up with that of the advanced teams. In Duchang County, more than 90,000 mu of early rice were growing poorly. The county party committee mobilized more than 8,000 cadres to go to areas with more Grade III seedlings to vigorously transform them. Gao Chaoda, secretary of the Yangzhou Reclamation Farm Party Committee in the county, moved his luggage to Maqin'ao, where there were many Grade III seedlings, and worked with the masses. He also cultivated a 1.3-mu experimental field to transform Grade III seedlings. He applied 50 dan of green manure and 50 dan of wall soil to this field, and weeded it twice, and the seedlings quickly improved. He immediately gathered team cadres and commune members to visit, and soon, more than 200 mu of Grade III seedlings in the entire Maqin'ao improved. Recently, due to continuous heavy rains, the water level of the Xiuhe River rose sharply, and the Luoting Reservoir in Yongxiu County along the river was in danger. Zhu Yichun, secretary of the Wukou Commune Party Committee in Yongxiu County, led a rescue team to the Luoting Reservoir overnight and camped on the spot to defend it.

　　After a large number of cadres went to the front lines of production, they carried forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, found key problems, tackled them, and widely cultivated experimental fields, using points to lead the way and comprehensively promoting production. After 30 cadres from county-level agencies in Leping County went to the Taqian Commune, they worked with the commune cadres to establish key rice fields in various production brigades, and then set up 43 experimental fields and experimental bases in the key fields, constantly exploring high-yield experiences using the method of dissecting sparrows. Under their leadership, a high tide of everyone cultivating experimental fields has been set off in various teams. As a result, not only has the area of early rice in this commune increased by 20% compared to last year, but also the field management work has been done well.

　　This newspaper reports that since this spring, Anhui Province has successively transferred a large number of cadres to the front lines of production. Before the end of May, the province had transferred more than 71,000 cadres from county-level and above agencies to the countryside and factories. Recently, another 11,000 cadres have been transferred to the countryside and factories and mines. Among the more than 1,000 cadres recently transferred from provincial-level agencies, there are 165 cadres at the department and division chief level or above. Led by the secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and members of the Standing Committee, this group of cadres set off in different directions on June 16.

　　The main task of the cadres transferred to the countryside from various agencies is to help the people's communes with summer production to ensure a good harvest throughout the year, and at the same time help the people's communes effectively manage and use grain well. The Provincial Party Committee requires all cadres sent to the countryside to continue to carry forward the fine style of eating, living, and working with the masses, and under the unified leadership of the local party committee, discuss with local cadres and the masses to discover and solve problems in production, and through in-depth investigation and research, summarize typical experiences and promote them comprehensively.

　　In order to continue to advance industrial production in the province, the Provincial Party Committee also called on cadres sent to factories to go deep into workshops and to the front of furnaces, focusing on technological reform, vigorously grasping the saving of labor and raw materials, continuously improving product quality, and continuously improving labor productivity, ensuring that the production of steel, iron, coal, and other items is completed according to quantity and quality, and striving to exceed the plan.

　　The vast majority of cadres regard going to the countryside to help with work as a glorious political task. They are determined to do a good job. (Attached picture)

    同群众一起劳动，一起找关键攻关键
    江西  安徽大批干部到队到田帮助搞好生产
    本报讯　从今年4月中共江西省委五届九次全体扩大会议发出改进工作作风的号召后，全省大批干部纷纷深入到生产第一线，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加生产，领导生产。省委的七位书记和大部分常委，都深入到基层去检查工作。省级机关抽调了二千五百多名干部（其中包括六十多名厅局长级干部），长期到基层工作。各地、市、县委都抽调了70％到80％的干部深入基层。这些干部在下去的时候，把他们的办公室、生产指挥部搬到了重点社、重点厂等最前线。各公社党委，较普遍地推行了“二五制”的工作方法。
    干部深入生产第一线，大部分是到那些条件比较艰苦、工作比较后进的地区，以身作则带头实干。因此，这些地区的基层领导力量得到加强，工作有很大改进。修水县组织了七百多名干部到后进地区，一方面当社员，参加劳动，同时又担任大队、小队实职，领导生产。至今一个多月来，全县一百六十九个后进队的工作，已有五十一个赶上了先进队。都昌县有九万多亩早稻生长较差，县委即动员了八千多名干部到三类苗较多的地区去，大力改造三类苗。该县扬州垦殖场党委书记高潮达把行李搬到三类苗多的马勤坳，同群众一起劳动，自己还搞了一亩三分改造三类苗的试验田。他在这块田里下了五十担青肥、五十担墙土，耘了两次草，禾苗迅速升了级。他马上召集小队干部和社员来参观，不久，整个马勤坳的两百多亩三类苗都升了级。最近连日大雨，修河水位急剧上涨，沿河的永修县罗亭水库遇险。永修县乌口公社党委书记朱裔春连夜带领抢险队赶赴罗亭水库露夜宿营，就地防守。
    大批干部深入生产第一线以后，发扬了苦干、实干、巧干的精神，找关键、攻关键，并广种试验田，以点带面，全面推动生产。乐平县三十名县直属机关干部到塔前公社后，和公社干部一起，在各个大队建立起了水稻重点坂，在重点坂内又搞了四十三个试验田和试验基地，用解剖麻雀的方法不断地摸索高产经验。在他们的带动下，各个小队也都掀起了人人种试验田的高潮。因此，这个公社不仅早稻面积比去年增加20％，而且田间管理工作也搞得好。
    本报讯　今春以来，安徽省陆续抽调大批干部深入生产第一线。5月底以前，全省县以上机关抽调下乡下厂的干部即达七万一千多名，最近，又抽调了一万一千多名干部深入农村和厂矿。省直属机关最近抽调的一千多名干部中，厅处长以上干部有一百六十五人，这批干部在省委书记处书记和常委委员带领下，已于6月16日分途出发。
    各机关抽调下乡的干部，主要任务是帮助人民公社搞夏季生产，保证全年丰收，同时帮助人民公社切实把粮食管好用好。省委要求所有下乡干部，都要继续发扬与群众同吃同住同劳动的优良作风，在当地党委的统一领导下，和当地干部、群众共同商量，发现和解决生产中的问题，并通过深入的调查研究，总结出典型经验，全面推广。
    为了把全省的工业生产继续向前推进，省委还号召下厂干部都要深入车间，深入炉前，以技术改革为中心，大抓劳动力的节约和原材料的节约，不断提高产品质量，不断提高劳动生产率，保证钢、铁、煤等项生产按量按质完成任务，并力争超过计划。
    广大干部都把下乡帮助工作，看作是一件光荣的政治任务。他们决心搞好工作。（附图片）
