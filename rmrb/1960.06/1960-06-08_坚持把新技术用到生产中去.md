Timely application of new technologies and experiences created in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to production, and continuously improving and developing new technologies and experiences in production, is a crucial measure to achieve a universal and significant increase in industrial production. It is also an extremely important task to guide the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to continue along the correct scientific and mass-based path. Many enterprises have greatly improved their output and quality, and have significantly saved manpower and materials, because they have timely and persistently applied new technologies and experiences to production, with remarkable results. Why are these enterprises able to apply new technologies and experiences to production in a timely manner? The key lies in the fact that the leading comrades of these enterprises have established correct attitudes and methods towards new things.

New technologies and experiences are new things created by the masses of workers in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. We should unswervingly stand on the side of new things, and should encourage workers, technicians and cadres' inventions and rationalization proposals spiritually, and vigorously support them materially. After a large number of inventions and creations have succeeded, does the work of caring for and cultivating new things end here? Absolutely not. The success of all inventions and creations is only the first step. More importantly, after success, they should be used in production in a timely and firm manner. Because we do not create for the sake of creation, nor invent for the sake of invention. The purpose of all creations and inventions is to improve labor productivity, develop production at high speed, and build socialism at high speed. After new technologies and experiences are successfully created, they must be planned to replace the original old technologies and experiences in order to play a role in production; otherwise, they are of no practical significance. Therefore, the process of technical innovation and technical revolution is not only about creating and inventing new technologies and experiences, but also includes the use and promotion of new technologies and new methods. Only by supporting the masses of workers to create and invent new technologies and experiences, and persisting in applying them to production, so that they completely replace the old technologies and old experiences in production, can we be regarded as thoroughgoing promoters.

Like creation and invention, persisting in using new technologies and experiences in production is also a struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the conservative. This is not only because new technologies and experiences may still have some shortcomings and need to be continuously improved and enhanced in production practice, but also because new technologies and experiences are completely new things for many people. People are not yet familiar with them and not accustomed to them. People's technical level is temporarily at a distance from what new technologies and experiences require. Familiar things are not needed, and unfamiliar things force people to learn. This is the situation faced when new technologies and experiences are first applied to production. However, it is not at all surprising that some difficulties may arise in the process of moving forward. As long as we rely on the masses, believe in the masses, and solve problems realistically, any difficulties can be overcome. When people have not fully mastered new technologies and experiences, their advantages in production cannot be fully realized. The question is, what attitude should we take in this situation? Should we actively learn and quickly adapt our technical level to the requirements of new technologies and experiences? Or should we be nostalgic for the old ways and go backwards? There is no doubt that we should adopt the first attitude and reject the second attitude. In this regard, the experience of Yi Shijuan's group in Shanghai State No. 2 Cotton Mill in promoting semi-automatic doffing machines is worth learning. Their policy is to study diligently and practice hard. All new technologies are completely and skillfully mastered after diligent study and hard practice. The successful use of the new technology of semi-automatic doffing in Yi Shijuan's group is the best proof of success achieved by adopting the correct attitude in using new technologies.

There are also enterprises where the new technologies and experiences created and invented have not been fully used in production or are not used frequently. The reason for this, in addition to the lack of correct ideological understanding, is that the organizational measures not keeping up is also an important factor. After new technologies and experiences appear and are promoted, production management, technical management, rules and regulations, etc., have not been changed accordingly. Management work lags behind the development of production, which of course will cause some inconvenience. What should we do? The successful experiences of various places prove that management work must be changed accordingly in the process of promoting new technologies and new methods, so as to adapt to the needs of production development. In this regard, ideological problems should be solved ideologically, and specific problems should be solved specifically. Therefore, after raising awareness and having a correct attitude towards new things, it is very necessary to strengthen organizational leadership. Wuhan City has adopted the "five fixes" method of setting projects, setting targets, setting measures, setting time, and setting responsibilities in the work of promoting new technologies and new experiences, which is a very good method.

In order to effectively apply the thousands of new technologies and new methods of great significance created in the technical innovation and technical revolution to production in June, so as to promote a substantial increase in production, we hope that every enterprise will firmly grasp the promotion and use of new technologies and new experiences, and under the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and with a tenacious spirit, grasp it to the end, so that new technologies and new methods will not only blossom, but also bear fruit.

### 坚持把新技术用到生产中去

    坚持把新技术用到生产中去
    及时地把技术革新、技术革命运动中创造的新技术、新经验用于生产，在生产中继续不断地提高和发展新技术、新经验，是争取工业生产普遍大幅度地增产的一个极重要措施，也是引导技术革新、技术革命运动继续沿着正确的科学的和全民的轨道前进的一项极重要的工作。许多企业由于及时地并且坚持地把新技术、新经验用于生产，结果产量和质量都有了很大提高，人力、物力也有了很大节约，效果十分显著。这些企业为什么能够及时地把新技术、新经验用于生产呢？关键在于这些企业的领导同志树立了对待新生事物的正确的态度和正确的方法。
    新技术、新经验是职工群众在技术革新、技术革命运动中创造的新生事物。我们应当坚定不移地站在新生事物这一边，对于工人、技术人员和干部的发明创造和合理化建议，应该在精神上加以鼓励，在物质上大力支援。当着大批创造发明成功了以后，是不是关怀和培植新生事物的工作就到这里为止呢？完全不是。一切发明创造的成功，仅仅是作了第一步的工作，更重要的，是在成功之后，及时地坚定地在生产中使用它。因为我们不是为创造而创造，不是为发明而发明，一切创造发明的目的都是为了提高劳动生产效率，为了高速度地发展生产，为了高速度地建设社会主义。新技术、新经验创造成功之后，必须让它有计划地代替原来的旧技术、旧经验，才能在生产上发挥作用，否则是没有实际意义的。所以，技术革新、技术革命的过程，不只是创造和发明新技术、新经验，而且包括使用和推广新技术、新方法。只有支持职工群众创造和发明新技术、新经验，又坚持用于生产，使它们在生产中完全代替旧技术、旧经验，这才算是彻底的促进派。
    跟创造和发明一样，在生产中坚持使用新技术、新经验，也是一场新与旧、先进与保守的斗争。这不只是因为新技术、新经验可能还有某些缺点，需要在生产实践中继续改进和提高，而且因为新技术、新经验，对于许多人来说，是全新的事物。人们对它们还不大熟悉，不大习惯。人们的技术水平跟新技术、新经验所要求的，暂时还有一个距离。熟悉的东西用不着，不熟悉的东西强迫人们去学习，这便是新技术、新经验开始用于生产时所面临的形势。但是，在前进中可能会出现一些困难，这是一点也不奇怪的。只要依靠群众，相信群众，实事求是地解决问题，什么困难都可以被克服掉。当人们还没有完全掌握新技术、新经验的时候，它们在生产中的优越性就不可能充分发挥出来。问题是我们在这种情况下，该采取什么样的态度？是积极学习，使自己的技术水平迅速适应新技术、新经验的要求呢？还是留恋老一套，走回头路？毫无疑问，我们应当采取第一种态度，拒绝第二种态度。在这方面，上海国棉二厂裔式娟小组推广半自动落纱机的经验，是值得学习的。她们的方针是勤学苦练，一切新技术经过勤学苦练以后，都被完全熟练地掌握了。半自动落纱的新技术，在裔式娟小组里被坚持使用的成功，就是采取正确态度使用新技术得到成功的最好的证明。
    也有的企业创造发明的新技术、新经验没有能完全用于生产或者不经常用于生产，其原因，除了缺乏正确的思想认识以外，组织措施跟不上也是一个重要因素。新技术、新经验出现和推广以后，生产管理、技术管理、规章制度等等，却没有作相应的改变。管理工作落在生产发展的后边，这当然会造成一些不方便。怎么办呢？各地成功的经验证明：在推广新技术、新方法的过程中必须相应地改变管理工作，使之与生产发展的需要相适应。在这方面，有思想问题要解决思想问题，有具体问题要解决具体问题，因此，在提高了认识，有了正确的对待新生事物的态度以后，加强组织领导工作，就是十分必要的了。武汉市在推广新技术新经验的工作中采取定项目、定指标、定措施、定时间、定责任的五定办法，是一个很好的办法。
    为了在6月份有效地把技术革新、技术革命中创造的上千成万件具有重大意义的新技术、新方法普遍用于生产，以便促进生产大幅度地增长上去，我们希望每一个企业，都要狠狠地抓一抓新技术、新经验的推广和使用，要在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，以坚韧不拔的精神，抓到底，使新技术、新方法，不仅开花，而且结果。
