New Inspiration
——Watching the Dance Drama "The Little Knives Society"
Li Ling
    After watching the dance drama "The Little Knives Society" by the Shanghai Experimental Opera House, the impression naturally arises that the art of dance drama has developed rapidly in recent years. Indeed, since the Great Leap Forward, a number of relatively good dance dramas have appeared successively, including "Five Red Clouds" depicting the reality of revolutionary struggle, "The Butterfly Lovers" full of romanticism, and "The Leifeng Pagoda" and "Shi Yi Chops Wood" based on myths and legends. Now, this "Little Knives Society" reflecting modern revolutionary history has also appeared. These works, whether in terms of ideological content or artistic carving, have considerable levels and have their own characteristics.
    The dance drama "The Little Knives Society" depicts the revolutionary historical facts of the great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle waged by the people of Shanghai under the leadership of Liu Lichuan and others of the Little Knives Society more than a hundred years ago. It fully demonstrates the painful lives of the people under the oppression of the corrupt Qing Dynasty soldiers and their heroic fighting will and optimism. It exposes the collusive behavior of feudal rulers and imperialists in destroying the revolution. It powerfully illustrates the truth that after the Opium War, if the Chinese people wanted to overthrow the reactionary feudal rule, they had to carry out the anti-imperialist struggle at the same time.
    As soon as the imperialist forces invaded China, they formed a battle line with the domestic reactionary forces to suppress and exploit our people; the Qing Dynasty was like this, and so it was later. At a time when peace-loving people all over the world are launching a vigorous opposition to the aggressive and robber-like behavior of US imperialism, staging such an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal work has important practical significance.
    The dance design and choreography of the dance drama are very successful. The heroic images of the three main characters, Liu Lichuan, Pan Qixiang, and Zhou Xiuying, are also well portrayed. The group dances in many scenes are very prominent, such as the "sword dance" and "tiger card dance" in "Night Attack", and the "bow dance" in "Breakthrough", all of which are concisely and beautifully choreographed, expressing the heroic and unyielding spirit of the insurgent army. The "Advance" scene is particularly outstanding, expressing profound meaning and being moving.
    The music of "The Little Knives Society" has achieved great success, the most prominent of which is the creation of the theme of heroic figures. Liu Lichuan's musical theme is based on the first phrase of the Guangdong ditty "Sailing to Seize the Championship" with some changes. Although this melody is very short, its tone is majestic, its rhythm is broad, and its mood is deep and infectious. When it appears for the first time, it immediately attracts people. It is very appropriate to use such emotionally deep and powerful musical language to express this heroic figure. Secondly, Zhou Xiuying's music can also better reflect the demeanor of this young heroine.
    Many narrative pieces in the dance drama are also written more prominently, such as several pieces of music in "Victory," which have a cheerful and bright tone. The music of the waltz is even more fresh and lively. The music when Liu Lichuan heroically sacrifices is also portrayed quite deeply. In addition, the mass dance music in "Night Attack" and "Breakthrough" is extremely personal. The music in the dream scene is also written poetically. The application of the orchestra in this dance drama is bold and effective. First of all, it dares to use a national orchestra to express such a complex plot and struggle; secondly, like using the suona to express Liu Lichuan's theme, it is extremely atmospheric (later, when it appears alone more often, it seems a little thin); in addition, in "Seeking Help", the pipa is used to describe Liu Lichuan's anxiety and fortitude when he is besieged and the insurgents are fighting hard in hunger, and it is depicted quite vividly with just a few simple sounds. In addition, the application of percussion is also bold and clever. The use of other instruments such as the erhu and flute also have their own unique features.
    The whole dance drama makes people feel that the shortcomings and points for discussion are: although the solo and duet dances have great creativity, such as the exploration of psychological states, and the lifts in the "bow dance" are choreographed lightly and beautifully, they are weaker than the group dance; the dream scene also seems loose, thus making people feel that the mime component in the later stage is more. Secondly, when Liu Lichuan died and fell on the stage, the insurgents hurriedly followed Zhou Xiuying without burying him properly. Such treatment does not seem appropriate, because the people cherish their leaders very much, and they would not leave him there and leave.
    Although the dance drama "The Little Knives Society" still has the above-mentioned and other weaknesses, such as some music and dance that are not developed enough, and the application of orchestration in some places can be enriched, the whole creation and performance is successful. In particular, their bold spirit of innovation and creation is extremely prominent. These innovations and creations raise the following very meaningful questions for us.
    First, in our country, dance drama and symphony are relatively young arts. On the major issues of expressing the real struggle life and developing towards nationalization, there is a common sense of frustration and there is no precedent to follow, so it is necessary to start from scratch. However, precisely because it is in a situation of extreme difficulty, it also spurs and stimulates everyone to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and boldly explore. Like "The Little Knives Society," "Five Red Clouds," and other new dance dramas, like the violin concerto "Mu Guiying Takes Command," "The Butterfly Lovers," and other new symphonies, they all show the meaning of the truth that "not being afraid of being poor and blank, as long as you have great ambitions, dare to think and dare to do, miracles will appear." Their success shows that even in difficult situations, as long as you dare to think and dare to do, there will be unexpected gains.
    Second, using classical (opera) dance as a foundation can not only express myths and legends, but also make it express the revolutionary reality of modern times. Especially after watching the "Heroic Miners" dance by workers in Shandong at the National Staff and Workers' Literary and Art Performance, this understanding is even stronger. In this way, an infinitely broad road is opened up for the art of dance drama that expresses the reality of struggle.
    Third, many people believe that due to the limitations of national orchestras in terms of volume, timbre, and orchestration, they are more than capable of depicting delicate and beautiful plots, but they will appear thin if used to express majestic and complex things, especially in dance dramas. The composer of "The Little Knives Society," as a result of many efforts, has changed many people's concepts of national orchestras, making people realize the true power of national orchestras and see that they still have great potential to tap.
    Finally, the application of dance props also gives us great inspiration. Most traditional Chinese dances use props in their hands, which makes some dancers feel cumbersome. "The Little Knives Society" closely combines with the plot, cleverly uses props to suggest the plot, and makes many useful attempts. This proves that as long as we think diligently and overcome the difficulty of props controlling people, props are no longer superfluous things, but powerful assistants serving the dance drama.

    新的启示
    ——看舞剧“小刀会”
    李凌
    看完了上海实验歌剧院的舞剧“小刀会”，自然而然就产生这样的印象：舞剧艺术近几年来有了迅速的发展。的确，大跃进以来，相继出现了不少较好的舞剧，有表现现实革命斗争的“五朵红云”，有富有浪漫主义色彩的“蝶恋花”，以及根据神话、传说写成的“雷峰塔”、“石义砍柴”，而今又出现了这个反映近代革命历史的“小刀会”。这些作品，不管从思想内容上，或是艺术雕刻上，都有相当的水平，而又各有特色。
    舞剧“小刀会”是描写一百多年前，上海人民在小刀会领袖刘丽川等人领导下，进行了一场伟大的反帝反封建斗争的革命史实。它充分地表现出人民在腐败的清朝官兵压榨下的痛苦生活，以及他们英勇战斗的意志和乐观主义精神；揭露了封建统治者与帝国主义互相勾结，摧残革命的强盗行为；有力地说明了在鸦片战争以后，中国人民要想推翻反动的封建统治，非同时进行反帝斗争不可的真理。
    帝国主义势力一侵入中国，就和国内的反动势力结成一条战线，来镇压和榨取我国人民；清朝如此，其后也是一样。当全世界爱好和平的人民展开轰轰烈烈的反对美帝国主义侵略强盗行为的时候，演出这样一个反帝反封建的作品，是有着重要的现实意义的。
    舞剧的舞蹈设计、编舞是很成功的。三个主要人物刘丽川、潘启祥、周秀英的英雄形象也有较好的刻划。有许多场合的群舞很突出，像“夜袭”中的“剑舞”、“虎牌舞”，“突围”中的“弓舞”都编得精练而又优美，表现了起义军的英武不屈精神，特别出色的是“前进”一场，表现得意深而感人。
    “小刀会”的音乐获得了很大的成就，其中最突出的是英雄人物主题的创造。刘丽川的音乐主题是参考广东小曲中的“赛龙夺锦”的头一句旋律加以变化而成的，这个旋律虽然很简短，但音调雄伟，节奏宽阔，情绪深沉而富感染力，当它第一次出现时，立刻就把人吸引住；采用这样情感深厚、气势磅礴的音乐语言来表现这位英雄人物，是非常适当的。其次，周秀英的音乐也能较好地体现出这位年青的女英雄的风貌。
    舞剧中有许多叙事的音乐也写得比较突出，像“胜利”中的几段音乐，音调欢快、明朗。三拍子舞的音乐写得更是新鲜、活泼。刘丽川英勇牺牲时的音乐，也刻划得相当深刻。此外，如“夜袭”和“突围”中的群众舞蹈音乐极富个性。梦境一场的音乐也写得富有诗意。这个舞剧乐队的应用，大胆而有效果。首先，它敢于采用民族乐队来表现这么复杂的情节和斗争；其次，像采用唢呐来表现刘丽川的主题，更是极有气氛（后来单独出现多了，就显得单薄一些）；还有，在“求援”中采用琵琶来描述刘丽川在被围困，起义军忍饥苦斗时的焦急心情和刚毅性格，只用了简单的几声，就描绘得相当到家。此外，对于打击乐的应用也是大胆、聪明。其他如二胡、笛子的使用也都有其独到之处。
    整个舞剧使人感到不足和需要商讨的地方，一是独舞和双人舞虽然有很大的创造，如描写心理状态有不少的探索，“弓舞”中的托举编得轻巧、优美，但比起群舞来要弱一些；梦境一场也显得松散，因而使人感到后段哑剧的成分多了一些。其次，当刘丽川牺牲以后倒在舞台上，起义军没有把他埋葬好就匆匆地跟着周秀英走了。这样的处理似乎不太恰当，因为人民对自己的领袖是爱护备至的，他们不会把他抛在那里不管就走了的。
    舞剧“小刀会”虽然还存在着上述的和另外的一些弱点，如某些音乐和舞蹈发展得不够，某些地方配器的应用还可充实一些等；但是，整个创作和演出是成功的。特别是他们大胆的革新和创造精神异常突出，这些革新和创造，给我们提出了下面几个很有意义的问题。
    第一，在我国来说，舞剧和交响乐一样都是比较年青的艺术，在表现现实斗争生活和向民族化发展这些重大的问题上，有着共同的苦闷，无例可考，都需要白手起家。但正因为是处在极度困难的境况里，也就鞭策和刺激大家非破除迷信，解放思想，大胆探索不可。像“小刀会”、“五朵红云”以及其他新舞剧，像“穆桂英挂帅”、“梁山伯与祝英台”小提琴协助曲以及其他新的交响乐，都显示了“不怕一穷二白，只要有雄心大志，敢想敢干，就会出现奇迹”这个真理的意义。他们的成功说明了即使是在困难的情况下，只要敢想敢干，就会有出人意料的收获。
    第二，采用古典（戏曲）舞为基础，不仅可以表现神话和传说，也能使之表现近代的革命现实斗争生活。特别是看了全国职工文艺会演中山东工人的“英雄的矿工”舞以后，这种认识更强烈了。这样，就为表现现实斗争生活的舞剧艺术开拓了无限宽广的道路。
    第三，不少人认为民族乐队由于音量音色以及编制上的局限，因之描写细致、优美的情节有余，如用以表现雄伟、复杂的事物，特别是表现舞剧就会显得单薄。而“小刀会”的作曲者，由于多方面努力的结果，改变了许多人对民族乐队的观念，使人认识到民族乐队的真正威力，并且看到它还大有潜力可挖。
    最后，关于舞蹈道具的应用，也给我们很大的启示。中国传统的舞蹈多半是手拿道具的，因此使有的舞蹈家感到累赘。“小刀会”密切结合剧情，巧妙地使用道具暗示情节，作出了不少有益的尝试。这证明只要我们勤恳的思索，克服了道具左右人的困难，道具就再不是多余的东西，而是为舞剧服务的有力助手了。
