Busy Wheat Harvest on the Banks of the Han River
By our reporters Tian Zhuang and Li Jinkai

May is the busy season for the wheat harvest.

Climbing up the Han River levee of the Puhe People's Commune in Yicheng County, Hubei, and looking out, what a charming scene it is! Outside the levee, the winding Han River flows quietly eastward; inside the levee, the rolling sea of wheat shines golden in the sunlight.

　　　Men, Women, and Children Vie to Harvest Wheat

This year, the more than 87,000 mu of wheat in the Puhe Commune is growing exceptionally well. Last year, also during this season, we visited some wheat-producing areas, but we had never seen such outstanding wheat: not only is the small plot good, but the large area is good; not only is each plot good, but each stalk is good. Wherever you go, the wheat is almost chest-high, as flat as if it were cut with a knife at a glance. The ears of wheat are dense, and a gust of wind rustles through them. One day, we came to the Guo Haiying Production Team, which was famous last year for achieving an average yield of 679 jin per mu over a large area. The team's Party Branch Secretary, provincial labor model Guo Jiaren, took us to a thousand-mu high-yield plot. The wheat was so tall that it almost drowned Lao Guo. He casually broke off an ear of wheat and counted 66 grains. Then he counted a few more ears, all around 60 grains, with the largest exceeding 70 grains. This surprised us. Normally, an ear of wheat only has 20 to 30 grains, and even the largest is only around 50 grains. Lao Guo saw our expressions and said, "The wheat here isn't even the best!" This is indeed a rare year of bumper harvest. No wonder the peasants are welcoming the harvest as if they were celebrating a joyous occasion! In fact, for the peasants, what could be more exciting than a bumper harvest, especially when this year's harvest is so extraordinary? In the Mao Cao Production Team, there is an old man named Li Changyi, who is 74 years old. He hasn't been in the fields for several years, but this year's wheat moved him. He ran to the wheat field by himself, holding the ears of wheat with great affection, saying repeatedly, "Good wheat! Good wheat!" On the eve of the wheat harvest, Old Man Li even requested to join the wheat harvesting ranks. The captain refused, and the old man got angry: "With such good wheat, who can stay at home!" After much persuasion, he still refused, so they had to let him sharpen sickles for everyone. Who knew that he secretly brought two sickles. As soon as he arrived in the field, he started cutting, regardless of people's persuasion. We also heard this story: In the eighth team of the Guo Haiying Production Team, there is an eleven-year-old primary school student named Fan Guicheng, who is not even as tall as the wheat. These days, he saw the adults sharpening their sickles. He thought to himself: What can I do? One day, he ran excitedly to his father, but his father turned him away: "Didn't you see that this year's wheat is dense and the stalks are thick? Can you cut it?" The child seemed wronged, pouting his little mouth and saying, "Even cutting one stalk is still one stalk less!" The father thought it made sense, so he gave him a sickle. The child ran off happily.

　　　Rivalry Heats Up

We have walked through many villages. Whether they are cadres or ordinary commune members, whether they are old people or young men, whether they are women or children, they are all busy with the unprecedented wheat harvest. As the masses themselves say: "Every household locks their doors, and men, women, and children go to harvest wheat."

However, amidst this celebration of the harvest, the Puhe Commune encountered a troubling issue: the wheat area is large and growing well. Based on the labor calculations of many production teams, the wheat could not be harvested in less than ten days. But the Party committee required the harvesting to be completed within seven days. What to do?

"Resolutely complete the task on time," the young men said, patting their chests.

"Not a single grain of the harvested wheat is allowed to be lost!" the old people said.

We arrived at this commune in mid-May. In those days, the Puhe Commune was like the eve of a battle, with large and small villages shrouded in a fighting atmosphere. In the quiet summer nights, the sound of sharpening sickles could be heard everywhere. The teams also held meetings one after another, sending battle reports and expressing their determination to compete in this battle. On the 24th, the first day of the harvest, red flags were waving in the bountiful fields, songs were resounding, and the endless sea of golden wheat was filled with the "chop chop" sound of harvesting. A tense battle to seize the harvest began...

The women's shock brigade led by Communist Youth League member Huang Shengying of the Hujiazhou Production Team's first team, in order to defeat their rival - the men's shock brigade led by Huang Daocheng - got up at three o'clock in the morning that day and invited their partners to go to the field. Huang Daocheng's shock brigade did not start work late that day either. These two shock brigades have been competing since last year's wheat harvest, and today's competition is even more intense. We only saw the women with towels on their heads and the young men with straw hats on their heads, advancing like saws in the wheat field. By noon, the women had harvested an average of 1.1 mu of wheat each, which is considered high efficiency in normal times, but compared to their opponents, they had harvested 0.2 mu less. The women were not discouraged. They held a meeting during lunch, identified the reasons for the loss in the morning, and the work efficiency significantly improved during the afternoon competition. When we visited, the women's group was closely chasing the men's group. As a result of the intense competition, the work efficiency of many production teams has significantly improved. Originally, it was planned that each person would harvest one mu per day, but now, some teams have reached 1.5 mu, and some have even reached 2 mu.

　　　Seize the Harvest and Plant, Season After Season of Bumper Harvest

As the saying goes, "Wheat ripens in a flash, silkworms age in an instant." If agricultural activities can be compared to battles, then wheat harvesting is the most intense scene of these battles. From the commune to the production team, all offices were moved to the fields. All cadres, like the commune members, slept in the fields and ate in the fields. Liu Zengtian, the County Party Secretary, and Huang Baofa, a member of the County Party Committee, who had led the commune members in a major battle against pests half a month ago, came to this commune again at the beginning of the wheat harvest and personally went to the front line to direct the battle of the harvesting army. These were such exciting days and nights! On the first day of harvesting, after breakfast, when we arrived at the He Luo Production Team, we happened to see Yang Zhengwen, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, returning from harvesting wheat in the field, his whole body soaked with dew. He was going back to the work shed for lunch. After lunch, he joined the wheat harvesting ranks of the sixth team. This team harvested quickly and cleanly, which caught Lao Yang's attention. While harvesting, he encouraged everyone, saying, "You are doing a good job! With a bumper harvest, we can't lose even one ear of wheat!" Hearing this, everyone worked even harder, and shouts of encouragement arose everywhere, presenting a joyful scene in the fields. Jia Changcheng, the General Branch Secretary of the He Luo Management District, found that the work efficiency was not high when he harvested wheat with the masses in the Mao Cao Production Team. The main reason was that they were not quick to start work, they were crowded together when harvesting wheat, and the sickles could not be swung freely, which affected the work efficiency. Therefore, he convened a battlefield meeting of the team leaders, organized a wheat harvesting competition, and mobilized the masses to carry out competitions between groups and between individuals. As a result, the work efficiency of many production teams doubled the next day compared to the first day. In the tense wheat harvesting battle, the cadres at all levels of the Puhe Commune worked in this way. We also often encountered such scenes: many people with sickles also carried medicine boxes and goods, these were doctors from the health center and staff from the commercial departments, they also came to the fields.

The more than 87,000 mu of wheat in the Puhe Commune had an unprecedented bumper harvest. When we left, the wheat harvest in this commune was still in full swing. In order to strive for an even greater harvest in the autumn, such scenes often appeared in the joyful fields of the harvest: people had just laid down the wheat at this end of the field, and people at the other end of the field were already shouting at the plowing cattle, starting to turn the soil, releasing water to irrigate the fields, and then transplanting rice, some were rushing to sow miscellaneous grains. In order to seize the season and race against time, the commune members in charge of planting also went to the fields before dawn and returned home when the night shrouded the earth, just like the people participating in the wheat harvest. They said excitedly: "We have had a bumper wheat harvest, and we must also strive for bumper harvests in every season and in everything, to achieve a complete victory in production!"

    汉水边上麦收忙
    本报记者　田庄　李金锴
    5月正是繁忙的麦收季节。
    爬上湖北宜城县璞河人民公社汉江大堤，举目眺望，真是一幅迷人的景色！堤外，蜿蜒东流的汉水静静地流着；堤内，滚滚麦海在阳光照耀下，金光闪闪。
          男女老幼争割麦
    今年，璞河公社八万七千多亩小麦长得太好了。去年，也是这样的季节，我们曾经到过一些盛产小麦的地方访问过，但都没有见过这么出众的小麦：不仅小块好，而且大面积好；不仅块块好，而且株株好。无论走到那里，麦子几乎都是齐胸脯深，一眼望去，就像刀切的一样平，麦穗密密麻麻，阵风掠过，发出“沙沙”声。一天，我们来到郭海营生产队，这个队去年曾因创造大面积平均单产六百七十九斤而出名。队的支部书记、省劳动模范郭家然带我们到一块千亩丰产方去，麦子高的简直要把老郭淹没了。他顺手折了一个麦穗，一数共有六十六粒，接着又数了几穗，都在六十粒左右，最大的一个达七十粒以上。这使我们吃了一惊。因为在通常情况下，一个麦穗只有二、三十个麦粒，最大的也不过五十粒上下。这时老郭已看出我们的神情，便说“在这里这麦子还算不上拔尖的哩！”这确是罕见的丰收之年，难怪这些日子农民们像办喜事似的迎接着丰收哩！说实在的，对于农民来说，有什么事情能比丰收更令他们兴奋呢，何况今年的丰收又是那样不寻常。茅草生产队有个叫李长义的老头，今年七十四岁，已经几年没下地了，今年的麦子把这老头给引动了，他独自跑到麦地里爱不释手地捧着麦穗看，连说“好麦！好麦！”麦收前夕，李老头竟要求参加割麦行列。队长不肯，老头火了：“这么好的麦子，谁能在家里呆得住！”左说右劝，始终不依，最后只好让他为大家打麦腰子，谁知他偷偷地带了两把镰刀，一到地里，就不顾人们的劝说割开了。我们还听到这样一个故事：郭海营生产队第八小队有个十一岁的小学生，名字叫范桂成，个子还没有麦子高。这几天，他看见大人们都在磨镰刀，他暗自思忖道：我干些啥呢？一天，他兴冲冲地跑到父亲那里，一张嘴就叫父亲顶回来啦：“你没见今年麦子密、秆子粗，你能割得动吗？”孩子好像受了屈似的，噘起了小嘴说：“割一根总少一根呀！”父亲觉得有理，便给了他一把镰刀，孩子这才欢蹦蹦地跑了。
        热气腾腾闹竞赛
    我们走过许许多多村庄，无论是干部还是一般社员，无论是老年人还是小伙子，无论是妇女还是儿童，都在为小麦的空前丰收忙碌着。正如群众自己说的：“家家户户齐锁门，男女老少去割麦。”
    但是，在这一片欢庆丰收声中，璞河公社曾经碰到一桩令人烦恼的事情：麦子面积大，生长好，从许多生产队劳力算账的情况看，没有十几天的工夫，麦子是割不完的。而党委的要求是七天之内完成割麦任务，这可怎么办？
    “坚决按时完成任务。”小伙子拍着胸膛说。
    “到手的黄粮可不准丢失一粒！”老年人这样说。
    我们是5月中旬赶到这个公社的。那些日子，在璞河公社像作战前夕一般，大小村庄都笼罩在战斗的气氛里。寂静的夏夜，到处可以听到磨镰刀声。各队还纷纷集会，送战表，表决心，坚决要在这场战斗中比个高低。24日，开镰的头一天，丰收的田野里，红旗招展，歌声荡漾，一望无边的金黄色的麦海，到处响起了“喳喳”的割麦声，一场夺取丰收的紧张战斗开始了……。
    护驾洲生产队第一小队共青团员黄圣英领导的妇女突击组，为了战胜自己的对手——黄道成领导的男子突击组，这天凌晨三点钟，就起床邀约自己的伙伴下地了。黄道成突击组这天出工也不晚。这两个突击组从去年麦收起就赛开了，今天赛得更是分外火热。只见头扎毛巾的妇女，和头戴草帽的小伙子，在麦林里像锯齿般地猛进着。到中午，妇女们平均每人已割麦一亩一分，这在平时来说，工效算是高的了，可是跟她们的对手一比，还少割了两分。妇女们可没有气馁，趁中午吃饭的时候召开了个会，找出了上午输的原因，下午比赛时，工效比上午显著提高。我们前往访问时，妇女组正在紧追男子组。由于大闹竞赛的结果，许多生产队的工效显著提高了。原来计划每天每人割一亩，现在，有些队达到了一亩半，甚至有的达到了两亩。
      抢收抢种　季季丰收
    俗话说：“麦熟一晌，蚕老一时”。如果可以把农事活动比做战斗的话，那末，麦收要算这些战斗中最紧张的一个场面了。从公社到生产队都把办公室搬到田间去了。所有的干部跟社员一样，睡在田间，吃在田间。半月前曾在璞河公社领导社员大战虫害的县委书记刘增田、县委委员黄保发，麦收一开始他们又来到了这个公社，并亲赴前线指挥收割大军战斗，这是多么激动人心的日日夜夜啊！割麦的头一天，吃过早饭，我们赶到何骆生产队时，正遇上公社党委副书记杨正文从地里割麦回来，浑身已被露水打得湿漉漉的，他是回工棚吃饭的。吃罢饭，他又参加了第六小队的割麦行列。这个小队割的又快又净，引起了老杨的注意。他边割边鼓励大家说：“你们干的好呀！丰收了，也不能丢撒一株麦穗呀！”说的大家劲头更大了，顿时?喝之声四起，田野里呈现着一片欢腾景象。何骆管理区总支书记贾常成在茅草生产队和群众一齐割麦时，发现工效不高，主要原因是上工不迅速，割麦时挤在一起，镰刀甩不开，影响工效。于是，他召集小队长开了个战地会，并且组织一个割麦比武大会，发动群众开展了组与组、人与人之间竞赛，这样一来，许多生产小队第二天的工效比头一天提高了一倍多。在紧张的麦收战斗中，璞河公社的各级干部就是这样地工作着。我们还经常遇到这样的情景，许多拿着镰刀的人，还带着药箱和货担子，这是卫生所的医生和商业部门的工作人员，他们也到田间来了。
    璞河公社八万七千多亩小麦空前地丰收了。我们离开的时候，这个公社的麦收还在热火朝天地进行着。为了争取秋季更大丰收，在丰收的欢腾的田野里，常常出现这样的情景：人们刚在地这头把麦子放倒，地那头的人们已经?喝着耕牛，开始翻整土地、放水灌田，紧接着插水稻，有的赶播杂粮。为了抢季节，争时间，分工管种的社员们，也跟参加麦收的人一样，天不见亮就下田，夜幕笼罩了大地才回家。他们兴奋地说：“小麦丰收了，还要争取季季丰收，样样丰收，来一个生产满堂红！”
