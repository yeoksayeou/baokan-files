Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party recently sent a memorandum to the Greek government, parliament, and various Greek political parties, demanding the restoration of the legal status of the Greek Communist Party.

The Greek Communist Party was declared illegal by the Greek authorities in 1947. This memorandum is the first formal document from the Greek Communist Party in fourteen years.

The memorandum states that the Greek people demand that the political leadership of Greece devote themselves to the work of restoring Greece's constitutional order and stability. The memorandum points out that in order to achieve this, all special laws promulgated during abnormal periods must be abolished, and the legal status of the Greek Communist Party must be restored.

The memorandum emphasizes that a party representing the interests of the working class cannot be eliminated, and that excluding the Greek Communist Party, which has been working to restore national unity and solve Greece's urgent problems, is detrimental to the country.

Not long ago, Greek newspapers also published an appeal from the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party to the Greek government, parliament, and various political parties, demanding the legalization of the Communist Party and the implementation of amnesty.

The appeal stated that the Greek Communist Party believes that in order to normalize the situation that has caused (domestic) division, there is only one path - amnesty.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the past month, the Greek authorities have continued to barbarously persecute Greek patriots. According to the "Dawn Daily" report, the Greek prosecutor had attempted to advise the military court to sentence five of the forty-two Greek democrats on trial to death. On May 20, the Greek military court brazenly sentenced six Greek patriots, Loules, Florakis, Dallas, Koutroukis, Tsakiris, and Chrisochoi, to life imprisonment. These events have aroused great anger among the Greek public. Greek opposition party members jointly raised questions to the government in parliament, accusing the government's actions of being anti-democratic.

At the same time, mass organizations and newspapers in the Soviet Union and Poland have also issued statements and articles protesting against the Greek authorities' illegal trials of Greek patriots.

Recently, the Greek public's demands for the release of Glezos and other democrats, the abolition of various illegal decrees, and the implementation of democracy have become even louder. According to the "Dawn Daily" report, eighty members of parliament jointly wrote to the Minister of Justice, accusing the authorities of illegally trying Glezos. Those who signed the letter included former ministers Kotlis and Giannis, famous social and political activists Passalidis, Tsirimokos, and others, representing the United Democratic Left Party, the Liberal Party, the Farmers' Party, the National Center Progressive Union, the New Land Movement Party, and others. The Greek Committee for the Defense of Democratic Freedoms and the Greek Writers' Association have also issued statements demanding that the authorities immediately release Glezos and all former resistance fighters who have been imprisoned for fifteen years, and also demanding the establishment of a democratic system in the country. The Athens Automobile Drivers' Union and the Automobile Transport Workers' Union, among others, also demanded that the Greek authorities release democrats and revoke the 375th law and other anti-democratic laws on which the current military court's trial of forty-two democrats is based.

    希共中央向政府、议会和各政党发出备忘录
    要求恢复希腊共产党合法地位
    希腊公众强烈要求释放格列索斯等爱国人士
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：希腊共产党中央委员会最近向希腊政府、议会和希腊各政党送了一份备忘录，要求恢复希腊共产党的合法地位。
    希腊共产党是在1947年被希腊当局宣布为非法的。这个备忘录是希腊共产党十四年以来的第一个正式文件。
    备忘录说，希腊人民要求希腊的政治领导让他们致力于恢复希腊的宪法秩序和安定的工作。备忘录指出，为了实现这一点，必须废除在不正常期间所颁布的一切特别法律，必须恢复希腊共产党的合法地位。
    备忘录强调指出，一个代表了工人阶级的利益的政党是不可能被消灭的，而且排斥一直为恢复国家的统一和解决希腊的紧急问题而努力的希腊共产党，对国家是不利的。
    不久以前，希腊报纸还刊登了希腊共产党中央委员会致希腊政府、议会和各政党的呼吁书，要求使共产党合法化和实行大赦。
    呼吁书说，希腊共产党认为，为了使造成（国内）分裂的局势正常化，只有一条道路——大赦。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯近一个月以来，希腊当局仍在不断野蛮地迫害希腊的爱国人士。据“黎明日报”报道，希腊检查官曾企图建议军事法庭判处正在受审讯的四十二名希腊民主分子中的五名以死刑。5月20日，希腊军事法庭又悍然把六名希腊爱国者卢列斯、弗洛拉基斯、达拉斯、库特鲁基斯、察基里斯、赫里索霍伊都判处无期徒刑。这些事件引起了希腊公众的极大愤怒。希腊反对党议员曾在议会向政府联合提出了质问，指责政府的行动的反民主性质。
    与此同时，苏联、波兰的群众团体和报纸也都纷纷发表声明和文章，抗议希腊当局对希腊爱国者的非法审讯。
    最近，希腊公众要求释放格列索斯和其他民主人士、取消各种非法的法令、实行民主的呼声更加高涨。据“黎明日报”报道，八十名议员联名写信给司法大臣，指责当局对格列索斯的非法审讯。在信上签名的包括：前大臣科特利斯和詹尼斯、著名社会和政治活动家帕萨利迪斯、齐里莫科斯等人，他们代表统一民主左翼党、自由党、农民党、全国中派进步联盟、新土地运动党等。希腊保卫民主自由工会委员会、希腊作家协会也纷纷发表声明，要求当局立即释放格列索斯和已经在监中监禁了十五年的所有前抵抗运动战士，还要求国内建立民主制度。雅典汽车司机工会和汽车运输工人联合会等也要求希腊当局释放民主人士，并撤销目前军事法庭审讯四十二名民主人士所依据的第三百七十五号法律和其他反民主的法律。
