Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd dispatch from London: Joseph Harsch, chief European correspondent for NBC, commenting on Eisenhower's Far East trip, said that the West "has lost several battles and lost the usefulness of Mr. Eisenhower."

Harsch's article was published in the London "Daily Express" on the 20th. In this article, Harsch said: "Clearly, something is wrong with the organization, situation, and influence of that thing we incompletely name 'the Western world,' and its fragmentation is particularly prominent in the Far East. ... American influence in the Far East is waning."

Harsch feels sadness about this situation, especially the complete exposure of Eisenhower's "fake peace" facade. He said, "There is sadness and tragedy in this picture" because Eisenhower originally "hoped—and undoubtedly expected—to end his public service perfectly after making a noble contribution to world peace. But as a peacemaker, he was rejected. The situation that has occurred contains danger for everyone. Eisenhower personally is a symbol of Western leadership... (However,) suddenly—almost overnight, he was stripped of his dignity, stripped of his ability to do good to the righteous and harm to the unrighteous. People see that the emperor has no clothes."

This American journalist laments that the days of imperialism are getting worse and worse. He said, "The deterioration of the situation is not limited to the Far East," "Africa and Latin America are in turmoil, and the old Western capitals are watching the evolution of the situation rather than guiding it."

    战争贩子的和平外衣已被剥落
    美国总统的欺骗作用丧失殆尽
    美国记者哈希说艾森豪威尔的远东之行是个“悲剧”
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：美国全国广播公司驻欧洲的首席记者约瑟夫·哈希在评论艾森豪威尔远东之行时说，西方“已输掉了几个战役，失去了艾森豪威尔先生的用处”。
    哈希的文章发表在20日的伦敦“每日快报”上。在这篇文章中，哈希说：“显然，我们不完整地命名为‘西方世界’的那个东西的组织、形势和影响发生了毛病，它的支离破碎的情况在远东表现得十分突出。……美国在远东的影响正在减退。”
    哈希对这种情况，尤其是对艾森豪威尔“假和平”面目的被揭露无遗感到悲哀。他说，“在这幅图景中，有着悲哀和悲剧”，因为，艾森豪威尔原来“希望——而且无疑是期望——在对世界和平作出崇高的贡献后圆满地结束他的公职。可是作为和平缔造者，他遭到了拒绝。所发生的局势，对所有的人都包含着危险。艾森豪威尔个人是西方领导的象征……（然而，）突然地——几乎一夜之间，他被剥去了威严，被剥去了他对正义者施善和对不义者施害的能力。人们看到的这个国王身上没有穿衣服。”
    这个美国记者哀叹帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。他说，“局势的恶化不限于远东地区”，“非洲和拉丁美洲正处于动乱中，老的西方各国首都是在眼望着局势演变而不是在指导这种演变”。
