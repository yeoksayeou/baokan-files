Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, New York Dispatch: Faced with a series of major diplomatic failures recently suffered by the United States in Asia and around the world, "Business Week" and "U.S. News & World Report," mouthpieces of American monopoly capital, are clamoring in their latest issues that the United States must further intensify its arms expansion and war preparations.

"Business Week" wrote in an editorial yesterday that, in light of recent developments, the United States must "do everything it can to strengthen" its so-called "security system" (i.e., aggressive military blocs) and "must maintain forward bases" in the coming years. It said that any "retreat" from forward bases would be "almost our last disaster in the struggle against Communism." It clamored, "We must develop our military strength so that we can attack quickly and devastatingly from the sea, from the air, or from our own territory."

The weekly specifically mentioned the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people, saying that the more one pays attention to the Japanese problem, the "more one will find that it is not a unique example in our global concerns." It said that events like those in Japan make "us face the necessity of strengthening the free world militarily, politically, economically - and, if we can use a very old word, spiritually."

"U.S. News & World Report," which will be published tomorrow, wrote, "Japan as an ally has become a big question mark, (South) Korea has been shaken, Okinawa can no longer be considered a reliable base, and the entire prospect of Asia is unstable. Black Africa faces great and growing unrest. Especially in Cuba, right under America's nose, a regime that is difficult to deal with has been established. All this has developed in a short time."

The weekly clamored that after Eisenhower returned from the Far East with a defeat that "seriously damaged America's prestige," the United States will pay closer attention to its "defense" and will re-examine its "world status."

In a news dispatch in the same issue, "U.S. News & World Report" pointed out that although disarmament talks are still continuing, disarmament seems to have "died." It said: future US military spending will increase rather than decrease; the plan to implement airborne alert by aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs will be even more imperative; the development of long-range missiles will be accelerated; the B-70 long-range bomber will have a better chance to develop; and the army will also get more money to modernize.

### 不顾失败教训　还要继续捣乱  美报刊鼓吹加紧备战

    不顾失败教训　还要继续捣乱
    美报刊鼓吹加紧备战
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：面对着美国最近在亚洲和全世界遭到的一连串重大外交失败，美国垄断资本的喉舌“商业周刊”和“美国新闻与世界报道”在最近一期中，叫嚷美国必须更加紧扩军备战。
    “商业周刊”昨天的一篇社论写道，鉴于最近的事态发展，在今后几年，美国必须“尽一切力量加强”它的所谓“安全体系”（即侵略性军事集团）和“必须坚持前沿基地”。它说，任何从前沿基地“撤退”都将“几乎是我们在对共产主义的斗争中的最后灾难”。它叫嚣，“我们必须发展我们的军事力量，使我们能够迅速地、摧毁性地从海上、从空中、或是从我们自己的领土上（发动）进攻。”
    这家周刊特别谈到日本人民的反美斗争说，人们越是仔细地注意日本问题，就“越会发现，它在我们的全球关心中不是一个独一无二的例子”。它说，像这样的日本事件使得“我们面对着在军事上、政治上、经济上——而且如果我们可以用一个非常旧的词来说的话，在精神上——加强自由世界的必要性。”
    将在明天出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”写道，“日本作为一个盟国已经成为一个大问号，（南）朝鲜被动摇了，冲绳不能再被认为是一个可靠的基地，亚洲的整个前景都是动摇不定的。黑非洲面临着巨大和日益增长的不安。特别是在美国眼睛边下的古巴，已经建立了一个难以对付的政权。这一切都是在不长的时间里发展起来的”。
    这家周刊叫嚷，艾森豪威尔带着“使美国的威信遭到重大伤害”的失败从远东回国之后，美国将更加密切地注意它的“防务”，并且将重新研究它的“世界地位”。
    同一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”在一则新闻电讯中指出，尽管裁军谈判仍在继续，裁军看来已经“死亡”。它说：今后美国的军事开支将要增加而不是减少；由载有氢弹的飞机实行空中警戒的计划将更是事在必行；远程导弹将加速发展；B—70型远程轰炸机将得到更好的机会发展；陆军也将得到更多的钱来实现现代化。
