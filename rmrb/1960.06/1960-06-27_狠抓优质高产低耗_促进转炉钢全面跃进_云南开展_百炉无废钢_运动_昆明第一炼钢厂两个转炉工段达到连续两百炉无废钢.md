Kunming, June 26th (By Our Newspaper) -- Workers in six converter steelmaking workshops in Yunnan Province launched a "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" competition centered on high yield, high quality, and low consumption in June, promoting an overall leap forward in steelmaking production throughout the province. The competition began on June 5th, and steel production in the last five days of the first ten days of the month immediately increased by 20% compared to the first five days; the steel qualification rate in the first ten days of June increased by 10% compared to May; the raw iron consumption per ton of converter steel decreased by 185 kilograms compared to May, and the lifespan of the converters also increased.

This competition was first initiated by the Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant. Since the first quarter of this year, the quality of steel produced by the steelmaking workshop had declined at one point, affecting the increase in output, and raw iron consumption had also increased significantly. At that time, some people believed that the quality of raw iron was not good, so good steel could not be produced. In early May, the Party committee of the plant seized this key point of the steelmaking workshop and organized all the workers in the workshop to conduct a major debate around the question of "Can white iron be made into good steel?" During the debate, everyone believed that the failure to produce good steel in the past was mainly a matter of ideology. They thought that bad iron could not be made into good steel anyway, so they did not try every possible means to improve the quality of the steel. After criticizing this thinking, the idea of high quality and high yield was further established among the workers. Everyone clearly realized that only by producing good steel can we increase steel production, reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel, and achieve an all-round leap forward with greater, faster, better and more economical results. Subsequently, the entire workshop quickly launched a "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" competition. As a result of the competition, by the end of May, two of the six workshops in the workshop had achieved more than 200 consecutive furnaces without scrap steel, and another two workshops had achieved more than 100 consecutive furnaces without scrap steel. The average qualification rate of steel ingots in the entire workshop in May reached 96%. Due to the large increase in qualified steel, steel production in May increased by 36% compared to April, and iron consumption decreased by 16% compared to April, achieving the goal of a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low consumption.

After the Yunnan Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department discovered the experience of Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant in taking the solution of quality problems as the center and driving the overall leap forward in steelmaking production, it held an on-site meeting at the plant in early June to promote their experience in the six converter steelmaking workshops throughout the province, and developed the "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" competition into an inter-factory competition among the six converter steelmaking workshops throughout the province. In this way, a great competition to seize steel, centered on improving quality, quickly unfolded throughout the province. In the competition, Kunming No. 2 Steel Plant organized "converter, melting furnace, steel ladle, ingot making, furnace building, raw materials, and power" seven processes to cooperate, strictly guaranteeing quality, eliminating the "four pests" of "chemical waste, short ingots, cold steel, and expanded steel," ensuring that the qualification rate of steel ingots increased from 82% in late May to 95% in early June.

### 狠抓优质高产低耗　促进转炉钢全面跃进  云南开展“百炉无废钢”运动  昆明第一炼钢厂两个转炉工段达到连续两百炉无废钢

    狠抓优质高产低耗　促进转炉钢全面跃进
    云南开展“百炉无废钢”运动
    昆明第一炼钢厂两个转炉工段达到连续两百炉无废钢
    本报昆明26日电　云南省六个转炉炼钢车间的职工在6月份开展了以高产、优质、低耗为中心的“百炉无废钢”竞赛，促进了全省炼钢生产的全面跃进。竞赛从6月5日开始，上旬后五天的钢产量立即比前五天猛增20％；6月上旬钢的合格率比5月份提高了10％；每吨转炉钢的生铁消耗量比5月份降低了一百八十五公斤，转炉的炉龄也延长了。
    这个竞赛是由昆明第一钢铁厂首先发起的。今年第一季度以来，这个厂炼钢车间钢的质量曾经一度下降，影响了产量的提高，生铁消耗量也显著增加。当时有人认为生铁质量不好，因此炼不出好钢来。5月初，厂党委抓住炼钢车间这个关键，组织全车间职工围绕“白口铁能不能炼好钢”的问题，开展了一场大辩论。在辩论中，大家认为，过去没有炼出好钢来，主要是思想问题。认为反正坏铁炼不出好钢来，因而没有千方百计想办法提高钢的质量。在批判了这种思想以后，职工中进一步树立了优质高产的思想。大家明确认识到只有炼出好钢，才能提高钢的产量，降低原料燃料的消耗，多快好省地全面跃进。接着全车间迅速开展了“百炉无废钢”的竞赛活动。竞赛的结果，到5月底，这个车间的六个工段就有两个工段达到了连续两百炉以上无废钢，另有两个工段连续一百炉以上无废钢，全车间5月份的钢锭合格率平均达到96％。由于合格钢的大量增加，5月份的钢产量比4月份提高了36％，铁耗比4月份降低16％，实现了高产、优质、低耗全面跃进的目标。
    云南省冶金工业厅发现了昆明第一钢铁厂以解决质量问题为中心，带动炼钢生产全面跃进的经验后，6月初在这个厂召开了现场会议，在全省六个转炉炼钢车间推广他们的经验，把“百炉无废钢”的竞赛发展成全省六个转炉炼钢车间的厂际竞赛。这样，一个以提高质量为中心的夺钢大竞赛，便迅速在全省展开了。竞赛中，昆明第二钢铁厂组织“转炉、化铁炉、钢包、造块、筑炉、原料、动力”七道工序共同协作，严格保证质量，消灭了“化学废品、短锭、冷钢、胀钢”等四害，保证了钢锭合格率由5月下旬的82％提高到6月上旬的95％ 。（附图片）
