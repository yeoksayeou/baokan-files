    "Finding Gaps to Insert Needles"
    Wen Yifeng
    Cadres of the Jin Feng Commune in Xinning, Hunan, in order to achieve "seizing every second and making use of every inch of land" to produce more grain, calculated several accounts: The scattered idle land of each team in the whole commune adds up to 13,000 mu. If 10,000 mu is used to grow miscellaneous grains, with a yield of 100 jin per mu, it can produce an additional one million jin of grain, enough for 2,000 people to eat for a year. Due to the development of the spirit of "finding gaps to insert needles" and "using sporadic time to plant sporadic land," as of late April, Hunan Province had utilized more than 4 million mu of idle land to plant various crops, which can increase dozens of jin of grain or hundreds of jin of vegetables per person. What a considerable harvest!
    People often say that when doing things, squeezing time requires "inserting needles into gaps." In this era of the Great Leap Forward, the comrades in Hunan have developed this spirit; they not only "insert needles into gaps" but also "find gaps to insert needles." Although there is only a one-word difference between "seeing" and "finding," it signifies that people have further developed their subjective initiative and that people's communist ideological consciousness has been further enhanced. Hunan Province has planted various crops on more than 4 million mu of idle land, which shows that the "gaps" for "inserting needles" are quite large. It is a pity to let them remain "idle" without inserting needles into the gaps. However, idle land is abundant, scattered, and often in remote places. Without making efforts to search everywhere, it is often not easy to "see" some "gaps," so the key issue lies in the word "finding." Not only should we "find gaps to insert needles," but we should also find them carefully and meticulously, by all means, to truly achieve "seizing every second and making use of every inch of land."
    This spirit of "finding gaps to insert needles" gives us a very profound enlightenment. Think about it carefully, is there any work of ours that has no "gaps" to "find"? Don't underestimate "sporadic." If all these sporadic "gaps" are "found" and "inserted" with "needles," I don't know how much more wealth will be created for the people. Are there still few "gaps" that no one cares about?
    In fact, the vast ocean also comes from a little bit, and thousands of years are also accumulated from one minute and one second. "Sporadic" water can converge into a mighty ocean, "sporadic" land can grow thousands upon thousands of dan of grain, and "sporadic" time can do great and earth-shattering things.
    Let us all learn this spirit of "finding gaps to insert needles," find all the "gaps," and "insert" all the "needles," so that all available positive factors can serve the cause of socialist construction.

    “找缝插针”
    文一风
    湖南新宁金峰公社的社员们为了作到“分秒必争，寸土不闲”增产更多的粮食，他们算了几笔账：全社各队的零星闲散土地，加起来有一万三千亩。如用一万亩种杂粮，亩产一百斤，就能多收一百万斤粮食，足够二千人吃一年。由于发挥了“找缝插针”的精神，“用零零星星的时间，种零零星星的土地”的结果，到4月下旬为止，湖南全省已经利用闲散土地种植各种作物四百多万亩，每人可以增加几十斤粮或几百斤菜。多么可观的收获呵！
    人们常说做事情，挤时间要“见缝插针”。湖南的同志们在这大跃进的年代里把这精神发展了，他们不仅“见缝插针”，而且“找缝插针”了。从“见”到“找”，虽然，是一字之差，但它标志着人们进一步发挥了自己的主观能动性，标志着人们共产主义思想觉悟的进一步提高。湖南全省用闲散土地种植了各种作物四百多万亩，由此可见，“插针”的“缝”，是相当大的，有缝而不插针，让它“闲散”着，实在可惜。但是，闲散土地又多、又散，又往往是偏僻的地方，不下功夫四处搜寻，“找”上一番，有些“缝”往往是不易“见”到的，因此关键的问题还在于这个“找”字。不但要“找缝插针”，而且要认真仔细地找，千方百计地找，才能真正作到“分秒必争，寸土不闲”。
    这种“找缝插针”的精神，给了我们极深的启示。你细想想吧，在我们的任何工作中，又何尝无“缝”可“找”？千万别小看“零零星星”，如果把这些零零星星的“缝”都“找”出来，都“插”上“针”，不知道要多为人民创造多少财富。难道无人问津的“缝”还少吗？
    其实，大海大洋也来源于一点一滴，千年万载也是由一分一秒积累起来的。“零零星星”的水，可以汇成浩浩荡荡的海洋，“零零星星”的地，可以种出千千万万担粮食，“零零星星”的时间，可以做出轰轰烈烈的事情。
    大家都来学习这种“找缝插针”的精神吧，把所有的“缝”都“找”出来，通通“插”上“针”，让一切可以利用的积极因素都来为社会主义建设事业服务。
