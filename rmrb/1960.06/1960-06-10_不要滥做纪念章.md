    Don't Overdo Making Commemorative Medals
    Recently, we have noticed that many conferences are making commemorative medals. For some conferences, like last year's National Congress of Heroes, making commemorative medals is acceptable; for other conferences, making commemorative medals is unnecessary. For example, some industries' single-sport games also made commemorative medals, which should be considered a waste. Copper is a very important industrial raw material and should be used as much as possible for production and construction.

    不要滥做纪念章
    最近，我们发现许多会议都做了纪念章。有的会议，如去年的全国群英会等，做纪念章还可以；有的会议，做纪念章就没有必要。例如，有的行业的单项运动会也做了纪念章，就应该说是浪费。铜是很重要的工业原料，应该尽量用到生产建设上去。
