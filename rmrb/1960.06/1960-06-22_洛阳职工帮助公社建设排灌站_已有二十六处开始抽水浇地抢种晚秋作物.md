    Luoyang Workers Help Communes Build Irrigation and Drainage Stations
    26 Stations Already Pumping Water to Irrigate Land and Rush-Plant Late Autumn Crops
    (Our dispatch) The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Luoyang City, Henan Province, are helping suburban communes build irrigation and drainage stations, vigorously supporting the fight against drought and the rush-planting of late autumn crops. To date, 32 irrigation and drainage stations have been established in Mangshan and Qinling, with 26 already pumping water. 75 machines have been installed, more than 30,000 meters of high-voltage power lines have been erected, and the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 60,000 mu.
    These irrigation and drainage stations were built in response to the spirit of the provincial party committee's directive this spring to "Mobilize the whole Party and the entire people to fight drought until the heavens bow their heads, and vow to win a bumper wheat harvest." The Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized factories and enterprises throughout the city to focus on building irrigation and drainage stations in hilly areas as a key means of vigorously supporting the fight against drought, drawing water up the mountains to fundamentally solve the problem of highland water conservancy. In accordance with the requirements of the municipal party committee, factories and enterprises adopted a one-stop approach, including guaranteeing technology, equipment, installation, repair, and technical training, proactively connecting with communes, surveying, planning, constructing, installing, and using simultaneously, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of the projects.
    In order to speed up the construction of irrigation and drainage stations, Comrade Lü Ying, First Secretary of the Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Yang Ligong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the Luoyang Tractor Factory, went to the construction site to survey and help solve key problems. Song Zhengxin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Northwest Metallurgical Company No. 2, and Wang Jingxian, Deputy Manager, led hundreds of workers and cadres from the electrician group, carpentry group, surveying group, and machine repair group to live on the construction site and participate in the battle alongside commune members. In just over ten days, they built a five-stage water diversion irrigation and drainage station, enabling all 4,500 mu of land in the Sunqitun Brigade of the Qinling Commune to achieve highland water conservancy. While building irrigation and drainage stations, various factories and enterprises also trained 166 technicians for the communes and brigades.
    In order to solve the problem of materials and equipment for the construction of irrigation and drainage stations, the broad masses of workers adopted methods such as excavating idle equipment, squeezing out surplus materials, and engaging in large-scale collaboration to overcome many difficulties. The Mining Machinery Factory mobilized its workers to use old materials to make high-lift centrifugal pumps, solving the problem of pumping water in high-lying areas. Workers at Northwest Metallurgical Company No. 2, through repeated experiments, used substitutes, saving valuable raw materials and manufacturing 25 electric motors, completing the machine installation task ahead of schedule.
    Now, the irrigation and drainage stations, standing tall on the tops of Mangshan, Qinling, and Longmen Mountains, are exerting their powerful force. Workers and commune members are actively leveling land and irrigating in order to win a greater autumn harvest. More than 10,000 mu of land have now been leveled, more than 7,000 mu of land have achieved highland garden farming, and more than 8,000 mu have been irrigated, allowing for the timely rush-planting of late autumn crops.

    洛阳职工帮助公社建设排灌站
    已有二十六处开始抽水浇地抢种晚秋作物
    本报讯　河南省洛阳市工业战线广大职工，帮助郊区公社大建排灌站，大力支援抗旱抢种晚秋作物。到现在为止，在邙山、秦岭共建立排灌站三十二处，已有二十六处开始放水，安装机器七十五台，架设高压动力线三万多米，扩大灌溉面积六万多亩。
    这批排灌站，是根据今春省委发出“全党全民齐动手，抗旱抗到天低头，誓夺小麦大丰收”的指示精神兴建的。中共洛阳市委发动全市工厂企业，在大力支援抗旱斗争中，确定丘陵地区以修建排灌站为重点，引水上山，从根本上解决高山水利化问题。各工厂企业根据市委要求，采取包技术、包设备、包安装、包修理、包技术培训等一包到底的办法，主动与公社挂钩，边勘察、边规划、边施工、边安装、边使用，使工程进展十分迅速。
    为了加快排灌站的建设速度，中共洛阳市委第一书记吕英、洛阳拖拉机厂党委书记兼厂长杨立功等同志，曾到工地勘察，帮助解决关键问题。西北冶金二公司党委副书记宋正新和副经理王景贤带领电工组、木工组、测量组、机修组等数百名工人和干部，住在工地和公社社员一道参加战斗。在短短十多天内，就建成一座五级引水上山的排灌站，使秦岭公社孙其屯大队四千五百亩土地，全部实现了高山水利化。各工厂企业在修建排灌站的同时，并为公社和大队培养技术人员一百六十六名。
    为了解决建设排灌站的材料、设备问题，广大职工采取了挖掘闲置设备、挤出多余材料、大搞协作等办法，克服了许多困难。矿山机器厂发动职工，利用旧料制成了高扬程离心水泵，解决了岗地抽水困难。西北冶金二公司工人，经过多次试验，利用代用品，节约了贵重原料、材料，制造了二十五台电动机，提前完成了机器安装任务。
    现在，林立在邙山、秦岭、龙门山顶的排灌站，正在发挥着它的强大威力。工人和社员为了夺取秋季更大丰收，正积极平整土地，抽水灌溉。现已平整土地一万多亩，有七千多亩土地实现了高山园田化，有八千多亩得到了灌溉，及时抢种晚秋。
