    Red Flower, Soldier, Revolutionary
    Lin Xu
    On the eve of "July 1st," the pomegranate flowers in our agency's courtyard are in full bloom. The fiery red and rich color of the flowers appear particularly bright and dazzling under the sunlight. Those fiery branches of flowers remind me of the communist flowers blooming on all fronts of our socialist construction.
    Not long ago, the *Jiangxi Daily* introduced the vivid deeds of Comrade Xie Meijiao, the First Secretary of the Xiaoxiao People's Commune Party Committee in Linchuan County, Jiangxi, on its front page. The title of the article was written in extra-large red characters: "A Big Red Flower - Xie Meijiao," and it was accompanied by a large photo of Comrade Xie Meijiao smiling enthusiastically, with rows of gold-shining medals hanging on her chest. Calling her a big red flower is not an overstatement. This twenty-nine-year-old Communist Party member is a model cadre of the Party, as well as an agricultural labor model, a women's model, and a military dependents model. She has attended district, county, prefectural, provincial, and national hero and model conferences as many as thirty-three times, which is truly admirable. How did this big red flower take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit on our land? There is a vivid introduction that says: "Since she took office as the First Secretary of the Xiaoxiao Commune Party Committee, in the 114 villages of the commune, in the fifty-mile radius of land, whether in the hot summer or the cold winter, whether in the storms or snowy days, the commune members could often see this short woman, with short hair, and eyes full of passion, the female secretary. She always works tirelessly, solving big and small problems for the masses. In the past two years, under the leadership of the commune Party committee headed by her, Xiaoxiao Township, which was originally at the lower reaches of the county, has leaped to become one of the most advanced communes in the county." Here, we see not only a bright red flower, but also a respectable and approachable strong communist fighter standing before us.
    Red flowers are loved for their rich colors, while soldiers inspire people with their valuable revolutionary qualities and communist spirit. We praise Xie Meijiao and learn from Xie Meijiao because her body shines with brilliant thought. She loves the Party and the masses; she is loyal to the cause of the Party and wholeheartedly serves the collective and the people; she resolutely listens to the Party's words and resolutely implements the Party's guidelines and policies. In particular, her revolutionary spirit of caring for the masses and the collective everywhere, and always thinking of the interests of the masses, and her down-to-earth, close-to-the-masses, truth-seeking, and hard-working style, deeply move us.
    Look! The Xiaoxiao Commune office uses old bungalows. The commune Party secretary and commune cadres live two people in a room, two people use one desk, and even Xie Meijiao and female deputy township head Wang Meilan share a bed. Some people say this is "stingy," but Xie Meijiao said: "The commune is a collective family, and our cadres are entrusted by the masses to manage this big family of the commune. The money belongs to everyone, and it cannot be spent recklessly. It must be used properly, and every penny must be used for the collective cause."
    One night, when discussing close planting, Xie Meijiao failed to convince the small team leader Zhou Shanrong, who advocated "sparse millet." The next day, she ran to the fields to consult with the experienced old farmer Zou Sanke; the commune wanted to build residential areas, what kind of houses would be good? Xie Meijiao went to the masses to solicit opinions. The old ladies hoped that the new house would have a vestibule, and sure enough, there was a vestibule. …
    In summer, in the midst of wind and rain, Xie Meijiao, in order to inform the masses to prevent rain, was drenched in the rain and developed a high fever; in winter, Xie Meijiao felt cold herself, and immediately thought that the elderly in the nursing home should wear cotton clothes. …
    Are these all insignificant little things? No! It is in these seemingly small things that Comrade Xie Meijiao has established a deep relationship with the masses that is closely connected, intimately linked, as close as brothers and sisters, and as close as flesh and blood; it is through these small things that Comrade Xie Meijiao has brought the warmth of the Party to the masses, brought the strength of the Party to the masses, implemented the Party's policies among the masses, and also brought the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses into full play in the cause of socialist construction. It is also in these small things that the excellent work style of Comrade Xie Meijiao, who cares for the masses, trusts the masses, closely links with the masses, and adheres to the mass line, is vividly and profoundly reflected, reflecting Comrade Xie Meijiao's revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. Our Party has always educated us to care for the masses and connect with the masses at all times, and to put the interests of the masses first; the leadership style and work methods of the mass line are the guidelines for us to carry out all our work. No matter when, no matter what work, being separated from the masses is like a fish out of water, like a bird with broken wings, nothing can be done, and nothing can be done well; and with the support and support of the masses, it is like the sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly, and there is unlimited wisdom and strength in doing things, and any difficult problems can be solved easily.
    Red flowers must take root in fertile soil; revolutionaries must take root in the masses. Comrade Xie Meijiao knows this truth well, and she has set an example for us to learn from with her exemplary actions. The reason why Xie Meijiao's deeds are praised by people is also because she has inherited this fine tradition of our Party and maintained the true color of the working people. She does this precisely out of deep class feelings for the working people, out of the viewpoint of everything for the people and everything responsible to the people; she does not do it occasionally, but cares for the masses, connects with the masses, and has done so for years. This sincere ideological feeling and simple style are the specific manifestations of Comrade Xie Meijiao's noble revolutionary qualities.
    When Xie Meijiao delivered the cotton clothes to the nursing home in time in winter, the old people were moved to tears. The old people held her hand and said: "Secretary Xie, you, you, are really good. As soon as it gets cold, you send cotton clothes. You don't rest after returning from Nanchang, and you think of us first. What you are sending is not cotton clothes, but a heart." Xie Meijiao replied: "This is nothing, this is my own work, and I should do it." Comrade Xie Meijiao's exemplary behavior is produced under the education of the Party and under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought. She consciously studies Mao Zedong Thought, improves her communist consciousness, and establishes a firm proletarian world view of wholeheartedly serving the people. It is precisely because Comrade Xie Meijiao has mastered Mao Zedong Thought and applied Mao Zedong Thought that she consciously regards caring for the masses and connecting with the masses as a duty. This revolutionary's excellent qualities and lofty communist spirit have further inspired and educated us deeply.
    Comrade Xie Meijiao is a bright red flower, a model communist fighter, and a revolutionary with a high degree of communist consciousness. She is also an example for each of us to emulate.

    红花·战士·革命者
    林旭
    “七一”前夕，我们机关院子里的石榴花开得正旺盛。那花红如火的浓艳色彩，在阳光照射之下显得格外灿烂夺目。那一枝枝像火一样的花朵，使我想起了那些盛开在我国社会主义建设各条战线上的共产主义花朵。
    不久以前，《江西日报》在第一版上介绍了江西临川县孝桥人民公社党委第一书记谢梅娇同志的生动事迹。文章的标题用特大的红字写着：《一朵大红花——谢梅娇》，前面还登了一张大大的照片，谢梅娇同志热情地欢笑着，脑前挂满了一排一排闪着金光的奖章。说她是朵大红花，一点也不过分。这个今年才二十九岁的共产党员，是党的模范干部，还是农业劳动模范、妇女模范、军属模范。她出席过区、县、专区、省和全国英模大会达三十三次之多，这真令人敬佩。这朵大红花是怎样在我国的土地上生根、发芽、开花、结果的呢？有一段生动的介绍说：“她任孝桥公社党委第一书记以来，全社的一百一十四个村庄，五十里方圆的土地，不论是炎热的夏天，还是寒风凛冽的冬季，不论是狂风暴雨或是风雪交加的日子里，社员们在田里或是在堂屋前，经常可以看见这位矮矮个子，剪着短短头发，有着一双深含热情的眼睛的女书记。她总是那样不知疲倦地工作着，为群众解决着大大小小的事情。两年来在以她为首的公社党委会的领导下，已把原来居全县下游的孝桥乡，跃进为全县最先进的公社之一。”在这里，我们看到的不仅是一朵鲜艳的大红花，而是面前挺立着一位可敬可亲的坚强的共产主义战士。
    红花是以浓艳的色彩引人喜爱的，而战士却是以可贵的革命品质和共产主义精神激发人心的。我们赞扬谢梅娇，学习谢梅娇，因为她身上闪烁着光辉的思想。她热爱党、热爱群众；她忠于党的事业、全心全意为集体、为人民群众服务；她坚决听党的话，坚决执行党的方针路线。特别是她那种处处关心群众，关心集体，时时刻刻为群众的利益着想的革命精神，她那种深入实际、深入群众，实事求是，艰苦朴素的工作作风，更加深刻地感动着我们。
    看吧！孝桥公社办公室使用着陈旧的平房。公社党委书记和公社干部都是两人住一间房，两人用一张办公桌，甚至谢梅娇和女副乡长王美兰共睡一张床。有人说这是“小气”，谢梅娇却说：“公社是个集体大家庭，我们干部是受群众的委托管理公社这个大家庭。钱是大家的，不能乱花，要用的得当，把一分一文钱都用到集体事业上去。”
    有一天晚上讨论密植，谢梅娇没有说服主张“稀禾谷”的小队长周善荣，第二天她就跑到田里找有经验的老农邹三科请教去了；公社要建设居民点，盖什么样的房子好？谢梅娇又到群众中征求意见去了。老太太们希望新房子有个过门厅，果然就有了过门厅。……
    夏天，在狂风暴雨中，谢梅娇为了通知群众防雨，自己却被暴雨淋湿发起了高烧；冬天，谢梅娇感到自己身上冷，就马上想到敬老院的老人们应该穿棉衣了。……
    这难道都是一些微不足道的小事情吗？不！正是在这些看来微小的事情上，谢梅娇同志和群众建立了息息相通，脉脉相连，情同手足，亲如骨肉的深厚感情；正是通过这些小事情，谢梅娇同志把党的温暖带给了群众，把党的力量带给了群众，把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，也把群众的积极性和创造性充分地运用到社会主义建设事业上来。也正是在这些小事情上，生动而又深刻地反映出了谢梅娇同志关心群众，相信群众，密切联系群众，坚持群众路线的工作方法的优良作风，反映出了谢梅娇同志全心全意为人民群众服务的革命精神。我们的党从来都是教育我们时时刻刻关心群众、联系群众，把群众的利益放在第一位的；群众路线的领导作风和工作方法是我们进行一切工作的准则。无论在什么时候，无论在什么工作上，脱离了群众就如鱼失水，如鸟折翅，什么事情也办不成，什么事情也办不好；而得到了群众的拥护和支持，那就海阔纵鱼跃，天高任鸟飞，办起事情来就拥有无限的智慧和力量，任何困难问题都可以迎刃而解。
    红花，是要在肥沃的土壤中生根的；革命者是要在群众中生根的。谢梅娇同志深知这个道理，她用自己的模范行动为我们树立了学习的榜样。谢梅娇的事迹之所以受到人们的赞扬，也正是因为她继承了我们党的这一优良传统，保持了劳动人民的本色。她这样做，正是出于对劳动人民的深厚的阶级感情，出于一切为了人民群众和一切向人民群众负责的观点；她也不是一时偶然地去做，而是处处关心群众，联系群众，几年如一日。这种真挚的思想感情和朴实的作风正是谢梅娇同志的高贵的革命品质的具体表现。
    当谢梅娇在冬季及时地把棉衣送到敬老院里去的时候，老人们感动地落泪了。老人们握着她的手说：“谢书记，你呀，你呀，真是好，天一寒你就送来棉衣，从南昌回来也不休息一下，先想到我们，你这那里是送的棉衣呀，是送来了一颗心。”谢梅娇回答说：“这没有什么，这是我本身的工作，应该这样做。”谢梅娇同志的模范行为正是在党的教育下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下产生出来的。她自觉地学习毛泽东思想，提高自己的共产主义觉悟，树立坚定的全心全意为人民群众服务的无产阶级世界观。正是因为谢梅娇同志掌握了毛泽东思想，运用了毛泽东思想，因此她把关心群众，联系群众，自觉地看成是一种本分。这种革命者的优秀品质和崇高的共产主义精神，更加使我们受到了深刻的启发和教育。
    谢梅娇同志是一朵鲜艳的红花，是一位模范的共产主义战士，是一位具有高度共产主义觉悟的革命者。也正是我们每一个人效法的榜样。
