Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 11th: The people of the Shantou and Foshan Special Zones in Guangdong Province, who have been hit by typhoons and torrential rainstorms, are launching an intense battle against floods and to carry out emergency rescues under the leadership of the Party. Tens of thousands of anti-flood troops are guarding the dikes day and night, fighting the floodwaters.

　　After landing near Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, at 2:00 AM on the 9th, the typhoon moved east through Bao'an, Huiyang, Haifeng, Jieyang, Lufeng, Zijin, Xingning, Wuhua, and other counties, entering Fujian. The areas severely hit by the typhoon generally experienced torrential rainstorms of 100 to 200 millimeters or more, with the largest reaching 400 millimeters, causing mountain floods and a surge in river water levels, resulting in severe disasters in some areas. As of 1:00 PM on the 11th, the water level of the Han River's Xiangzi Bridge, the largest river in the Shantou Special Zone, had reached 16.88 meters, marking an extraordinary flood peak.

　　As early as before the typhoon appeared, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on preventing wind and floods on the morning of the 8th, based on meteorological forecasts. In the afternoon, it held a telephone conference, calling on relevant areas to immediately mobilize and go all out to fight the strong typhoon and heavy rainstorms. In accordance with the provincial committee's instructions, all localities immediately launched intense battles to prevent wind and floods, to repair dikes and reservoirs, and to harvest ripe early rice and other crops. At the critical moment of the arrival of the typhoon and rainstorm, leading cadres at all levels in the Shantou Special Zone immediately rushed to the front lines of the struggle. Luo Tian, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, and Yu Xiqu, the deputy commissioner, rushed to Jieyang County to command the battle after receiving news of the typhoon hitting Jieyang. Except for a few who stayed behind to direct operations, leading cadres at all levels in all counties of the special zone also rushed to the forefront of the anti-flood struggle. Under the exemplary leadership of cadres at all levels, the masses were in high spirits and competed to go to the dikes to fight the floods. In Chenghai County, 70% of the labor force had gone to the dikes to fight the floods yesterday alone. Not only did commune members near the dikes turn out in large numbers, but many commune members far from the dikes also demonstrated communist spirit by sending labor to provide support. Thanks to the efforts of cadres, the masses, and the garrison troops, the entire line of dikes in the lower reaches of the Han River was generally raised by about one meter yesterday, ensuring the safety of all major dikes under the impact of the extraordinary flood peak.

　　Yesterday, Qu Mengjue, Wen Minsheng, secretaries of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Zhang Gensheng, secretary-general of the provincial committee, personally visited the front line of flood fighting in the Shantou Special Zone and Shantou City to inspect the flood-fighting struggle and extend cordial greetings to the vast masses participating in the flood fighting and rescue efforts. After inspecting the above-mentioned areas, Qu Mengjue, Wen Minsheng, and others immediately decided to use air drops to quickly deliver a large number of麻袋（ma dai, sacks), straw bags and other flood-fighting materials to the dangerous sections of various rivers and reservoirs to support the anti-flood army. Many severely dangerous dikes and reservoirs were saved from danger due to the timely supply of materials.

　　At present, the typhoon and rainstorm have passed, but the anti-flood struggle in the Han River basin is still in full swing. While vigilantly guarding the dikes and fighting the floods, the people in the affected areas are putting even greater effort than in fighting the wind and floods into the battle to restore production. The vast number of cadres and the masses live, eat, labor, and discuss together, making arrangements for the lives of the people in the disaster areas, and further promoting production.

　　After the typhoon passed, Bao'an County decided on the night of the 9th to mobilize the entire party and all the people to resolutely overcome difficulties, defeat the disaster, actively restore production, and win a bumper harvest of late rice crops. That evening, the county party committee sent work teams to various places to carry out disaster relief and production recovery work. After a day and night of intense fighting, many reservoirs and dikes have been repaired. At present, a high tide of production recovery is being launched in various communes, with intensive efforts to wash seedlings, support seedlings, cultivate soil, apply fertilizer, strengthen late-stage field management of late rice, dredge ditches for drainage, replant late-rice seedlings, and rush to plant miscellaneous grains. The people of Bao'an, Huiyang, Haifeng, Lufeng and other counties are determined to fully restore production as quickly as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 11th: The People's Liberation Army Guangdong Garrison, which fought alongside the people of the Dongjiang River last year to overcome the extraordinary floods, has once again rushed to the front line of the struggle against wind and floods these days.

　　After receiving news of the typhoon and rainstorm on the night of the 8th, the troops immediately conducted emergency combat mobilization, and leading organs at all levels established wind and flood prevention headquarters (posts). Commander Chen De and Commander Peng Longfei of a certain unit spread out maps and deployed the battle as if commanding an operation. The leaders of a certain unit also led organ personnel and telecommunications equipment to the Bao'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to assist them in joint command. Many officers and soldiers helped the local people's communes in carrying out various preparations for wind and flood prevention all night long.

　　At 3:00 AM on the 9th, when the typhoon and rainstorm hit the Dongjiang River Basin, the rescue and assault teams of various units set off one after another, fighting on the river dikes and reservoir dams regardless of the wind and rain. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 officers and soldiers fighting on the Dongjiang River and eleven reservoirs, including Shenzhen and Wanyao, have resolved the danger in seven reservoirs and are continuing to reinforce four reservoirs after two days and nights of fighting. The rubber boats of an engineering unit rescued a group of people trapped by water in the Danshui area. A certain unit took more than 300 rescued people to the barracks and took care of them like relatives.

　　After the wind stopped and the rain subsided on the 10th, the communications soldiers of various units were busy erecting and repairing poles and wires, and the engineers were rushing to repair damaged roads and bridges. Many units also sent work teams to the local people's communes to help carry out recovery work.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 11th: Party, government, military, and civilian personnel in Fujian are bravely fighting against the attacks of typhoons, rainstorms, floods, and tides. At 2:00 AM on the 9th, the first typhoon of this year, which landed from Guangdong, entered southwestern Fujian and the middle and lower reaches of the Min River. By 10:00 AM on the 10th, it had left the sea near the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang. The characteristics of this typhoon were that it came early, landed for a long time, and had strong winds, with the wind force at the center of the typhoon reaching about level 10. Due to the impact of the typhoon, heavy rainstorms and heavy rains have fallen in various parts of Fujian since the 7th. Coupled with the backing of the sea tide, the water levels of various streams and rivers have risen to varying degrees.

　　Since the typhoon landed on the coast of Guangdong and moved to Fujian, the Party, government, military, and civilian personnel of the entire province have risen up to fight against wind, rain, and floods with all their strength. Localities have organized assault teams, rescue teams, and patrol teams in a timely manner, and under the personal leadership of leading Party and government cadres at all levels, have fought day and night on the embankments of various rivers, coastlines, reservoirs, transportation lines, and fields to protect the safety of various projects, residents' lives and property, and crops. When the typhoon hit the western Fujian region on the night of the 9th, Deputy Governor Liu Yongsheng, who was working in the Yongding area, immediately joined the masses in flood discharge and flood fighting. In the middle and lower reaches of the Jiulong River, cadres at all levels of the Party and government worked day and night with the masses to protect river embankments, reservoir dams, and crops, and help the masses transfer property. Responsible cadres of the Jinjiang Prefectural Party Committee and the Quanzhou Municipal Party Committee also personally led the anti-flood army to rush to repair flood control projects. In a very short period of time, the Quanzhou flood control dike was raised to more than four meters, ahead of the flood peak. The vast number of cadres and masses in the Minhou Special Zone in the lower reaches of the Min River and the Nanping Special Zone in the upper reaches of the Min River also joined the struggle to protect dikes and carry out rescue operations. Officers and soldiers of the Fujian Front Garrison also drew manpower and materials to support the local people in their fight against the disaster.

　　Now, as the center of the typhoon has left the sea, the wind force in various parts of Fujian has gradually weakened, and the heavy rainstorms and heavy rains have gradually weakened and stopped. In addition to continuing to resist rainstorms and floods, the people of the province are putting all their efforts into various aspects of production to ensure a double harvest of coal, iron, and grain.

    台风暴雨猛袭广东福建  千万军民顽强抗风抗洪
    新华社广州11日电　遭受到台风和特大暴雨袭击的广东省汕头佛山专区的人民，在党的领导下，正在展开一场抗洪抢险的紧张战斗，数以万计的抗洪大军日夜护守堤围和洪水搏斗。
    这次台风于9日凌晨二时在广东省宝安县附近登陆以后，向东经宝安、惠阳、海丰、揭阳、陆丰、紫金、兴宁、五华等县，进入福建。遭受到台风严重袭击的地区，普遍下暴雨一百到二百毫米以上，最大的达到四百毫米，引起山洪暴发，江水猛涨，部分地区造成了严重灾害。到11日下午一时止，汕头专区最大的河流——韩江湘子桥的水位已达到一六点八八米，出现了特大洪峰。
    早在台风出现之前，中共广东省委即根据气象预报在8日上午发出了防风防洪的指示，下午又召开了电话会议，号召有关地区立即动员起来，全力以赴，为战胜强台风和大暴雨的袭击而斗争。各地根据省委指示，都立即展开防风防洪抗洪的紧张战斗，立即组织人力加紧整修堤围和山塘水库，抢割已熟的早稻和其他作物。台风暴雨来临的严重时刻，汕头专区各级领导干部立即赶赴斗争最前线，地委第一书记罗天，副专员余锡渠接到台风袭击揭阳的消息后，立即赶到揭阳县临阵指挥。全专区各县各级领导干部除了少数人留家指挥以外，也都赶到了抗洪斗争的最前线。在各级领导干部以身作则的带动下，广大群众斗志昂扬，争先上堤抗击洪水。澄海县昨天一天已经有70％的劳动力上堤抗击洪水，不仅靠近堤围的公社社员纷纷出动，许多远离堤围的公社社员也发扬了共产主义风格，派出劳动力，进行支援。在干部、群众和驻军的奋战下，昨天韩江下游的全线堤围已普遍加高一米左右，保证了在特大洪峰的侵袭下，各个主要堤围的安全。
    昨天，中共广东省委书记处书记区梦觉、文敏生和省委秘书长张根生等亲临汕头专区和汕头市抗洪最前线视察抗洪斗争，并对参加抗洪抢险的广大群众进行亲切的慰问。区梦觉、文敏生等视察了上述地区以后，立即决定用空投的办法，派飞机把大量麻袋、草包等抗洪器材，迅速投到各江河水库的危险地段，支援抗洪大军。许多险情严重的堤坝和水库，由于及时得到器材的供应，都转危为安。
    目前，台风暴雨已经过去，但韩江流域的抗洪斗争仍在紧张进行，受灾地区的人民一面警惕地守卫堤围与洪水搏斗，一面拿出比抗风抗洪更大的干劲，投入恢复生产的战斗。广大干部和群众同住、同吃、同劳动、同商量，安排好灾区人民的生活，进一步推动生产。
    宝安县在台风过去以后，即在9日深夜决定动员全党全民坚决克服困难，战胜灾害，积极恢复生产，夺取晚造大丰收。当晚县委即派出工作组到各地开展救灾和恢复生产的工作。经过一天一夜的紧张战斗，已经修复了许多山塘、水库、堤围。目前，各公社正在掀起一个恢复生产的高潮，大抓洗苗、扶苗、培土、追施肥料，加强迟禾后期田间管理，疏沟排水，补播晚造秧苗，抢种杂粮。宝安、惠阳、海丰、陆丰等县群众斗志昂扬，决心以最快的速度全面恢复生产。
    新华社广州11日电　去年与东江人民并肩战胜特大洪水的人民解放军广东驻军，这几天又奔赴抗风抗洪斗争的前线。
    8日午夜，部队接到台风暴雨的消息后，立刻紧急进行战斗动员，各级领导机关成立了防风防洪指挥部（所）。某部首长陈德少将、彭龙飞少将铺开地图，像指挥作战一样部署战斗。某部首长还带领机关人员和电讯器材，赶到中共宝安县委，协助他们共同指挥。许多部队官兵通宵不眠地帮助驻地人民公社进行防风防洪的各种准备工作。
    9日三时，当台风暴雨猛袭东江流域时，各部队抢险突击队，纷纷出发，不顾风吹雨打奋战在江堤和水库大堤上。据不完全统计，战斗在东江等大堤和深圳、婉窑等十一个水库上的两千多名官兵，经过两天一夜战斗，已有七个水库解除了险情，四个水库在继续加固。某工兵部队的橡皮船在淡水一带抢救一批被水围困的群众。某部把抢救出的三百多名群众，接到营房，像亲人一样地照顾安置。
    10日风停雨住后，各部队的通讯兵忙着架修电杆电线，工兵赶修被冲毁的道路桥梁，许多部队还派工作组到驻地人民公社帮助进行恢复工作。
    新华社福州11日电　福建各地党政军民英勇抗击台风、暴雨、洪水和大潮等灾害的袭击。9日二时，从广东登陆的今年第一次台风，由广东北部进入福建西南部和闽江中、下游，到10日上午十时，已从福建浙江交界附近出海。这次台风的特点是：来得早、登陆时间较长、风力大，台风中心风力达十级左右。由于台风影响，7日以来，福建各地普降暴雨和大雨，再加海水大潮顶托，各溪河水位都有不同程度的上涨。
    这次台风从广东沿海登陆向福建移动时起，全省党政军民即以全力奋起抗风、抗雨、抗洪，各地都及时组织了突击队、抢险队、巡逻队，在各级党政领导干部亲自领导下，日夜奋战在各江河堤防、海岸线、水库、交通沿线和田间，保卫各项工程、居民生命财产和农作物的安全。当9日夜晚台风猛袭闽西地区时，正在永定地区工作的副省长刘永生立即和群众一起投入排洪抗洪。在九龙江中下游地区，各级党政干部日夜不眠，同群众一起奋战，保护江河堤岸、水库堤坝和农作物，帮助群众转移财物。中共晋江地委和泉州市委负责干部也亲自带领抗洪大军，突击抢修防洪工程，在很短时间里，泉州防洪堤加高到四米多，抢在洪峰的前面。闽江下游地区闽侯专区和闽江上游南平专区广大干部和群众也都投入护堤、抢险斗争。福建前线驻军官兵也抽出人力、物力支援当地群众抗灾斗争。
    现在，随着台风中心已经出海，福建各地风力已逐渐减弱，暴雨、大雨逐渐转弱和停止。全省人民除了一面继续抗拒暴雨、洪水，广大地区正以全力投入各项生产，确保煤铁、粮食双丰收。
