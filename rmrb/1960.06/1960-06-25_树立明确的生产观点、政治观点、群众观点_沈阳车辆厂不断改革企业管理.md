Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 24th: The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, based on the new circumstances of continuous production development, uses clear production, political, and mass perspectives to promptly adjust labor organization, improve leadership methods, and revise rules and regulations, making enterprise management a driving force for promoting production, thereby effectively ensuring the sustained leap forward in production. Comparing April of this year with July of last year before the reform, freight car production increased by 1.52 times, locomotive production increased by five times, and the turnover days of working capital were shortened from 112 days to 36.5 days.

Starting in July last year, this factory carried out three large-scale reforms successively, addressing new problems that constantly emerged in enterprise management and new situations that occurred in production. First, focusing on strengthening technical management, it established and consolidated more than 100 rules and regulations for process management, quality inspection, etc.; restored and improved full-time inspection agencies, and consolidated the work of workers participating in management. This greatly improved product quality, increasing the average monthly production level in the third quarter by 21% compared to May and June. In the fourth quarter, in order to better coordinate enterprise management with the technical innovation movement, under the organization and leadership of the factory Party committee, a second reform was carried out. The characteristic of this reform was to closely combine the management personnel of the departments, the management personnel of the workshops, and the workers participating in the management through competition, overcoming the problems of uncoordinated work steps between upper and lower levels and department personnel staying in the office. This ensured that the production level in the fourth quarter increased by 47.7% compared to the third quarter. Since the beginning of this year, due to the deepening of the "four modernizations" movement and the significant increase in production, this factory has launched a technical revolution in management work, changing complex calculation and statistical work to using advanced calculation tools, freeing management personnel from daily trivial matters. This series of reforms has maintained a continuous upward trend in production, with the average monthly production level from January to April of this year increasing by 10.4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

After continuous reform, the enterprise management of the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has embarked on a new stage. They regard "production must rise step by step" as the guiding ideology for organizing production; thoroughly changing the old methods of organizing production that only see things but not people, determining output based on existing materials and equipment capabilities, and balancing towards backward links. Under the guidance of this ideology, when preparing plans, full consideration is given to the subjective initiative of people, making each month's plan higher than the previous month's level. Moreover, in the method of formulating plans, it has also changed from the past emphasis on monthly plans to emphasis on ten-day and daily plans. Leading cadres have also gone deeper than ever before. In order to solve problems in a timely manner, production meetings have also been moved to the workshops; wherever there is a problem, professional meetings are held there. In terms of departmental management work, the factory has now delegated most of the cadres from the technology and inspection departments to the workshops, realizing "one set of personnel, dual leadership." This ensures that management personnel are better integrated with production practice and work more effectively under the unified leadership of the workshop. Through the close combination of professional management personnel and mass management personnel, since the fourth quarter of last year, this factory has equipped 569 sets of advanced experience on site, incorporated more than 570 experiences into operating procedures; broke through thousands of production key points, and vigorously promoted the continuous development of production.

    树立明确的生产观点、政治观点、群众观点
    沈阳车辆厂不断改革企业管理
    本报沈阳24日电　沈阳机车车辆工厂根据生产不断发展的新情况，用明确的生产观点、政治观点和群众观点及时调整劳动组织，改进领导方法，修改规章制度，使企业管理工作成为推动生产前进的动力，从而有效地保证了生产持续跃进。以今年4月份和去年改革前7月份比较，货车产量增长了一点五二倍，机车产量增长了五倍，流动资金周转天数由一百一十二天缩短到了三十六天半。
    这个厂从去年7月份开始，先后针对企业管理中不断出现的新问题和生产中发生的新情况，进行了三次较大规模的改革。首先以加强技术管理为中心，建立和整顿了工艺管理、质量检查等一百多项规章制度；恢复和健全了专职检查机构，并整顿了工人参加管理的工作。从而大大提高了产品质量，使第三季度平均月产水平比5、6月份提高了21％。第四季度，为了使企业管理工作更好地配合技术革新运动，在工厂党委的组织领导下，进行了第二次改革，这次改革的特点，是通过竞赛形式，把科室管理人员、车间管理人员和参加管理的工人紧密地结合起来，克服了上下工作步调不相衔接、科室人员蹲办公室的毛病。这样，又保证了第四季度生产水平比第三季度提高了47．7％。今年以来，由于“四化”运动的深入开展和产量的显著增长，这个厂又开展了管理工作技术革命，把复杂的计算统计工作改为运用先进的计算工具来进行，使管理人员从日常繁琐的事务中摆脱出来。这一系列的改革，使生产保持了持续上升的局面，今年1至4月份平均月产水平又比去年四季度提高了10．4％。
    沈阳机车车辆工厂企业管理工作经过不断改革后，已经走上了一个崭新的阶段。他们把“生产必须步步上升”作为组织生产的指导思想；彻底改变了过去见物不见人，以现有材料、设备能力确定产量，向落后环节平衡的旧的组织生产的方法。在这一思想指导下，编制计划就充分估计到人的主观能动性，使每月计划都高于前一个月的水平。而且在制订计划的方法上，也从过去的以月计划为主改变为以旬、日计划为主。领导干部也比以前任何时期更加深入了。他们为了解决问题及时，生产会议也搬到车间去开；哪里有问题，就到哪里召开专业会议。在科室管理工作方面，目前这个厂已把工艺、检查部门绝大部分干部下放到了车间，实现“一套人马，双重领导”。这样就保证了管理人员在车间统一领导下和生产实际结合得更好，工作作得更有成效。通过专业管理人员和群众管理人员的密切结合，从去年四季度以来，这个厂在现场配成了五百六十九套先进经验，把五百七十多项经验纳入了操作规程；突破了上千个生产关键，有力地推动了生产不断地向前发展。（附图片）
