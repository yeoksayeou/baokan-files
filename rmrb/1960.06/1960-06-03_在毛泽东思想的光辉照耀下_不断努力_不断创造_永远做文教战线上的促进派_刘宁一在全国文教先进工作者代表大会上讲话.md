Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in his speech at the plenary session of the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education today, extended warm congratulations on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the representatives of advanced units and advanced workers in socialist construction in education, culture, health, sports, and journalism from all over the country. At the beginning of his speech, he said: The situation of the comprehensive, sustained, and great leap forward on China's cultural and educational front is a very encouraging and excellent situation. This new situation is the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. It demonstrates the firm will and infinite strength of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to conquer economic backwardness and cultural backwardness.

In his speech to more than 6,000 representatives, Liu Ningyi focused on the movement of Chinese workers to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, as well as the development of workers' spare-time education and workers' cultural, artistic, sports, and health undertakings.

Liu Ningyi said that the movement of the Chinese working masses to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works has now formed an extremely broad movement. Marxism-Leninism is the ideological system of the working class, so they are most likely to accept Marxism-Leninism. After studying theory, the working masses have greatly improved their communist ideological consciousness and moral character, brought into play their subjective initiative, established the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and aroused the drive for continuous revolution. This has enabled them to further profoundly understand the correctness of the Party's General Line and closely link the cause of socialist construction with the great ideal of realizing communism.

Liu Ningyi cited the achievements of the workers of the Shanghai Qiu Xin Shipyard in studying Mao Zedong's works to illustrate the importance of studying theory. 95% of the workers in this factory studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They used theory to guide their participation in the current political and ideological struggles and production practice, and fully exerted their subjective initiative. The workers excitedly called studying theory "one shot, four echoes": mastering the weapon, raising awareness, promoting production, and promoting revolution. When introducing these situations, Liu Ningyi emphasized: Facts have repeatedly proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse on the road of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Once it arms the minds of the working masses, it can broaden their horizons, enable them to have foresight, and play a huge role in promoting the current technological revolution and cultural revolution, becoming an invincible material force.

Liu Ningyi then talked about the new situation of great development and great improvement in China's workers' spare-time education. He said: As of the end of March this year, the number of workers enrolled in factories and mines across the country reached more than 22.2 million, an increase of 6 million or 35% compared with the end of last year; among them, the number of workers participating in half-work, half-study programs also increased from 145,000 to 175,000. Many enterprises have established a system of workers' spare-time education from elementary to specialized levels, and various regions have also formed workers' spare-time education networks run by enterprises themselves, jointly run by enterprises, jointly run by factories and schools, and run by regions.

Liu Ningyi said that the situation of the leap-forward development of socialist construction requires workers' spare-time education to keep up closely. The national upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works and the in-depth development of the technological revolution have had a profound impact on workers' spare-time education. Running urban people's communes on a large scale is more conducive to the development of workers' and laborers' spare-time education. He especially mentioned the issue of using Hanyu Pinyin to speed up literacy. He said that by fully utilizing this experience and combining it with other effective accelerated literacy experiences that have been available in recent years, we can advance victoriously and we will certainly be able to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers across the country this year or next year. "Get rid of illiteracy without dismounting, immediately advance to elementary school," and insist on completing literacy and popularizing elementary education in one go. We may also be able to popularize elementary education among young and middle-aged workers across the country during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

Liu Ningyi pointed out that running workers' spare-time education on a large scale plays an important role in promoting the development of production, improving the political, cultural, and technical level of workers, and cultivating talents for national construction. As long as we implement the Party's education policy, persist unremittingly, and continuously revolutionize, we can cultivate a large number of new people who have both a high degree of political consciousness and modern scientific and cultural knowledge, who can engage in technical design and personally manufacture, so that the broad masses of workers can leap forward along the road of "intellectualizing workers and peasants," preparing the necessary conditions for gradually eliminating the differences between manual and mental labor and for transitioning to a communist society.

After mentioning the development of workers' cultural, sports, and health activities, Liu Ningyi said that the achievements in workers' spare-time education and culture, sports, and health are achieved under the leadership of the Party, as a result of implementing the Party's General Line and the policy of "walking on two legs." At the same time, it is also inseparable from the help of professional workers and the active efforts of amateur workers. He asked cultural and educational workers to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, further unite, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, keep striving, keep creating, and forever be promoters on the cultural and educational front, and strive to achieve the great goal of the cultural revolution.

### 在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下　不断努力　不断创造  永远做文教战线上的促进派  刘宁一在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上讲话

    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下　不断努力　不断创造
    永远做文教战线上的促进派
    刘宁一在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上讲话
    新华社2日电　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在全国文教先进工作者代表大会今天举行的全体会议上，代表中华全国总工会热烈祝贺来自祖国各地的教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表。他在讲话一开始就说：我国文教战线全面持续大跃进的形势，是一个使人极为振奋的大好形势。这个新形势是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物，它显示了我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，征服经济落后、征服文化落后的坚强意志和无穷的力量。
    刘宁一在向六千多名代表所作的讲话中，着重叙述了我国职工开展的学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的运动，以及职工业余教育和职工文化艺术、体育、卫生事业的发展情况。
    刘宁一说，我国工人群众学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，目前已经形成了一个极其广泛的运动。马克思列宁主义是工人阶级的思想体系，因此他们最容易接受马克思列宁主义。工人群众学习了理论，大大地提高了共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，发挥了主观能动作用，树立了“愚公移山”的精神，鼓起了不断革命的干劲。这样就使他们进一步深刻地认识到党的总路线的正确性，把进行社会主义建设事业和实现共产主义的伟大理想密切地联系起来。
    刘宁一举出上海求新造船厂职工学习毛泽东著作的成就，来说明学习理论的重要意义。这个工厂有95％的职工学习了毛主席的“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等著作。他们用理论来指导自己参加当前的政治思想斗争和生产实践，充分发挥了人的主观能动作用。工人们兴奋地把学习理论称作“一炮四响”：掌握了武器，提高了觉悟，促进了生产，推动了革命。刘宁一介绍这些情况时强调说：事实一再证明，毛泽东思想是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设道路上的灯塔，一经武装了工人群众的头脑，就能使他们眼界开阔，高瞻远瞩，对当前的技术革命和文化革命起巨大的推动作用，成为无往而不胜的物质力量。
    刘宁一接着谈到了我国职工业余教育出现的大发展大提高的新局面。他说：全国厂矿企业职工入学人数，截至今年3月底已达两千二百多万，比去年底增加了六百万，增长35％；其中参加半工半读的职工也由十四万五千人增加到十七万五千人。许多企业已经建立了从初等到大专的职工业余教育体系，各地也都形成了企业自办、企业合办、厂校联办以及地区举办的职工业余教育网。
    刘宁一说，社会主义建设飞跃发展的形势，要求职工业余教育紧紧跟上。全民性的学习毛主席著作的高潮，技术革命深入地开展，都对职工业余教育发生深刻的影响，大办城市人民公社，更加有利于职工和劳动人民业余教育的发展。他特别提到利用汉语拼音加快扫盲速度的问题。他说，充分利用这一经验，并且跟几年来已有的其他行之有效的速成扫盲经验相结合，乘胜前进，我们一定能够在今年或者明年内基本扫除全国青壮年职工中的文盲。“脱盲不下马，立即升高小”，坚持扫盲和普及初等教育一气呵成，我们也可能在第二个五年计划期间内，在全国青壮年职工中普及初等教育。
    刘宁一指出，大办职工业余教育，对促进生产的发展，提高职工的政治、文化、技术水平，培养国家建设人材，起着重要的作用。只要我们贯彻执行党的教育方针，坚持不懈，不断革命，就能培养出大量的既有高度的政治觉悟，又有现代的科学文化知识，既能从事技术设计，又能亲自动手制造的新人，使广大职工群众沿着“工农群众知识化”的道路飞跃前进，为逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，为过渡到共产主义社会准备必要的条件。
    刘宁一在提到职工文化、体育、卫生活动的发展情况以后说，职工业余教育和文化、体育、卫生方面的成就，是在党的领导下取得的，是贯彻执行了党的总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针的结果，同时，也是和专业工作者的帮助、业余工作者的积极努力分不开的。他要求文教工作者坚决遵循毛主席的教导，进一步团结起来，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，不断努力，不断创造，永远作文教战线上的促进派，为实现文化革命的伟大目标而奋斗。
