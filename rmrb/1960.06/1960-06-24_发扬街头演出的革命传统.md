    Street performances have always been one of the revolutionary art forms led by the Party to deeply penetrate the masses, carry out propaganda and mobilization, and possess a strong fighting spirit. More than twenty years ago, in areas under Kuomintang rule, the reactionaries desperately suppressed revolutionary art and prevented all progressive artists from integrating with the workers and peasants. They seized all the theaters and cinemas, preventing anti-Japanese and national salvation art from having performance venues. However, at that time, revolutionary artists, under the leadership of the Party and with the support and encouragement of the broad masses of the people, broke through the Kuomintang reactionaries' "cultural encirclement and suppression" and launched a "guerrilla war" on the art front, adopting various methods to perform in the streets. Street performances like "放下你的鞭子" [Put Down Your Whip], and the singing of national salvation songs and anti-Japanese Yangko dances in the streets, often attracted many audiences. Here, the people truly heard the voice of truth, raised their awareness, and stirred up their anger against Japanese imperialism and traitors and collaborators, which played a significant role in educating and mobilizing the broad masses to carry out the war of resistance against Japan. Such exciting street performances and angry songs during demonstrations made the reactionaries very headache. They could not prohibit it, so they resorted to violence and persecution, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames that had been ignited everywhere and block the voice of the people. All of this did not scare the revolutionary art workers. Whenever they had a chance, they reappeared on the streets.

    This revolutionary tradition was even more greatly developed in the revolutionary base areas under the leadership of the Party. The Party required art to better serve politics, encouraged artists to better integrate with the people, and required artists to conduct artistic performances as much as possible based on the production, work, and life of the masses. Therefore, in addition to regularly conducting various stage performances, artists in the base areas also frequently performed in city squares, rural streets, fields, threshing grounds, and other places, depending on the specific situation. This performance style could blend in with the masses, and the relationship between the two sides was very close. Especially during a political movement, many art troupes mobilized together, propagating everywhere, truly creating a grand momentum, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and fully exerting the fighting role of art. Art workers in the army not only performed in companies and garrisons, but also conducted mobilization work during marches, at the starting point of charges, and even in battles, which can be said to be a new development in breaking the stage framework and conducting "street performances."

    Since liberation, all performance venues have belonged to the people, and theaters have become artistic fronts for regularly conducting socialist and communist ideological education for the masses, and places to meet the cultural needs of the masses. Theater performances (including various stage performances in urban and rural areas) have become an extremely important way for art to serve politics and serve workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres, and therefore have received attention from leaders and the broad masses of art workers. The achievements of theater performances in the past decade have been very great. However, street performances are still an important form of propaganda and education work to cooperate with political tasks and the central work. During every major political movement, large numbers of art workers went to the streets and the countryside to perform, playing a significant role. Especially in 1958, in order to widely publicize the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," the vast majority of art workers across the country went to the streets and the countryside, and many of the most famous artists participated in square performances. Coupled with other forms of stage performances and publicity activities, it truly reached the point of being known to every household. Recently, the country has launched a propaganda week against American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace. Art workers across the country have actively mobilized to participate in this great political action. They will use all art forms and take various propaganda activities to express the Chinese people's boundless hatred of American imperialism and their firm determination to fight, that is, to use the weapon of art to combat American imperialism's policy of aggression and war conspiracy, and to demonstrate the Chinese people and the people of the world's determination and enormous power to finally bury American imperialism. At the same time, it is also a profound patriotic and internationalist education for the masses, which is of great significance. In this, street performances will once again play its unique role. In addition to performing anti-American programs in various theaters, art troupes have organized street propaganda teams. This large-scale theater performance and street performance will surely form a vigorous and fiery propaganda climax, which will greatly inspire the people of the capital, the people of the country, and the people of the world, and will be a very serious blow to the enemy.

    The characteristics of street performances are short and concise programs, clear content, able to blend in with the masses, and have a strong mobilizing effect. This revolutionary traditional performance form should be adhered to and greatly developed in the future. However, conducting street performances now is different from the period under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, our performance venues were very few, or even non-existent. Sometimes we relied on street performances to attract the masses, the purpose was to attract more people's attention, that is, to disrupt the order of the city. Now is the era when the people are in power, and production, work, and study are very intense. Therefore, when conducting street performances, we must fully consider all aspects of the situation, choose appropriate times and locations, and not affect the production, work, and study of the masses and cadres. This will be more welcomed by the broad masses and cadres.

    发扬街头演出的革命传统
    周巍峙
    街头演出一直是党领导下的革命文艺深入广大群众，进行宣传鼓动，富有战斗精神的活动方式之一。二十几年前，在国民党统治地区，反动派拼命打击革命文艺，阻止一切进步的艺术家和工农群众结合。他们霸占了所有的剧场、电影院，不让抗日救亡的艺术有演出阵地。但是，当时的革命的文艺工作者在党的领导下，在广大人民的支持和鼓舞下，也冲破了国民党反动派的
  “文化围剿”，在艺术战线上打起了“游击战”，采取各种方式在街头演出。像“放下你的鞭子”在街头的演出，救亡歌曲、抗日秧歌在街头的演唱，常常能吸引很多观众。人民在这里真正听到真理的呼声，提高了自己的觉悟，鼓舞起反对日本帝国主义和汉奸、卖国贼的激愤心情，这在教育和动员广大群众进行全民抗战的工作方面是起了不小的作用的。这种激动人心的街头演出和在游行示威时的愤怒歌声，是很使反动派头疼的，他们禁止不了，就采取暴力手段，进行迫害，想扑灭已经到处燃起的革命的火焰，封锁人民的呼声。这一切吓不倒革命文艺工作者们，一有机会，他们又在街头出现了。
    这种革命传统在党领导下的革命根据地更是得到大大的发扬。党要求艺术更好地为政治服务，鼓励艺术家更好地和人民结合，要求艺术家们要尽量根据群众的生产、工作和生活情况，进行艺术演出活动。因此，根据地的艺术家们除了经常进行各类舞台演出外，也根据具体情况经常在城市的广场、农村的街头、地头、打谷场上等等地方演出。这种演出方式能和群众打成一片，双方关系十分亲切，特别在一个政治运动当中，许多艺术团体一起出动，到处宣传，真正是声势浩大，深入人心，可以充分发挥艺术的战斗作用。部队艺术工作者不但在连队、驻地演出，而且在行军中，在冲锋的出发地，甚至在战斗中也进行鼓动工作，这可以说是打破舞台框框，进行“街头演出”的新的发展了。
    解放以来，所有的演出场所都归人民所有，剧场成为经常向群众进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育的艺术阵地，是满足群众文化生活的地方。剧场的演出（包括城乡各种各样的舞台演出）成为艺术为政治服务，为工农兵及其干部服务的极其重要的方式，因而受到领导上和广大艺术工作者的重视。十年来剧场演出的成绩是非常大的。但是，街头演出仍然是配合政治任务、配合中心工作进行宣传教育工作的重要形式。每次大的政治运动，都有大批大批的艺术工作者上街下乡演出，起了很大的作用。特别是在1958年，为了广泛宣传党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，全国绝大多数的艺术工作者都上街下乡了，而且许多最著名的艺术家都参加了广场演出。加上其他各种形式的舞台演出和宣传活动，真正做到家喻户晓的程度。最近全国展开了反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的宣传周，全国艺术工作者已积极动员起来参加这一伟大的政治行动，他们将用一切文艺形式，采取各种宣传活动来表达中国人民对美帝国主义的无比憎恨和坚强的斗争意志，也就是要用艺术的武器打击美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争阴谋，表现中国人民和全世界人民最后要埋葬美帝国主义的决心和巨大的威力。同时也是对群众进行一次深刻的爱国主义和国际主义教育，意义是十分重大的。在这当中，街头演出又将发挥它的特有的作用。各艺术团体除了在各个剧场大演反美节目外，都组织了街头宣传队。这次大规模的剧场演出和街头演出，一定会形成一次轰轰烈烈、热火朝天的宣传高潮，对首都人民、对全国人民、对全世界人民都会起巨大的鼓舞作用，对敌人将是一次十分严重的打击。
    街头演出的特点是节目短小精悍，内容鲜明，和群众能打成一片，具有强烈的鼓动作用。这种革命传统的演出形式，今后还要坚持进行，大大发扬。不过，现在进行街头演出和在国民党反动派统治时期有所不同。那时我们的演出阵地很少，甚至根本没有。有时就靠街头演出把群众吸引过来，目的就是要引起更多的人的注意，就是要把城市的秩序搅乱。现在是人民自己当权的时代，生产、工作、学习都十分紧张，因此进行街头演出就要充分考虑各方面的情况，选择适当的时间、地点，不影响群众和干部的生产、工作和学习，这就会更受到广大群众和干部的欢迎。
