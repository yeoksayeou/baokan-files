Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th. "Pravda" today published a Geneva dispatch stating that for the past week, Western representatives on the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee have decided not to move even the smallest step forward.

　　The dispatch pointed out that the main conclusion that can be drawn from the speech made by the US representative Eaton at the committee on the 10th is that the US delegation still stands on its original position. This position is to prevent the committee's work from achieving any results.

　　The Soviet representative Zorin concluded in his speech to the committee that the first week of the committee's work did not bring about the possibility of a concrete discussion of the Soviet proposal. This is because the representatives of Western countries were not prepared to conduct this discussion and had not completed the study of the Soviet proposal and "mutual consultation."

　　He said: The Western delegations are trying to divert the committee from the solution of disarmament issues and back to the so-called supervision of individual measures that have nothing to do with disarmament. They have long known that this would enable the committee to stand still without any results. (Attached picture)
    ——This work is getting harder and harder!
    ——I am solving your difficulties through the disarmament conference.

    苏联“真理报”评裁军委员会情况
    西方代表寸步不前
  　新华社莫斯科11日电　“真理报”今天刊登了一篇日内瓦通讯说，一周来，西方代表们在十国裁军委员会上决定连最小的一步也不前进。
　　通讯指出，从美国代表伊顿10日在委员会上的讲话中可以得出的主要结论是，美国代表团仍然站在原来的立场上。这种立场就是不让委员会的工作有获得成果的可能。
　　苏联代表佐林在委员会的发言中已作出结论说，委员会第一周的工作没有带来具体讨论苏联提案的可能。因为西方国家的代表没有准备进行这种讨论，没有结束对苏联提案的研究和“相互磋商”。
　　他说：西方代表团企图使委员会离开对裁军问题的解决，而回到实际上没有裁军的所谓监督的个别措施上去，他们早就知道这样就能够使委员会毫无成果地在原地踏步不前。（附图片）
    ——这工作越来越不好干了！
    ——我正在通过裁军会议解决你的困难。
