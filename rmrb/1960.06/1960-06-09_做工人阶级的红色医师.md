    Becoming a Red Doctor of the Working Class
    Ren Jiran, Su Bei People's Hospital, Jiangsu Province
    I am a traditional Chinese medicine doctor at the Su Bei People's Hospital in Jiangsu Province. My family has practiced medicine for generations; I am the tenth. My son is also a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, and my grandson is also studying medicine. I am sixty-eight years old this year, and I have been studying medicine with my father since I was sixteen, and opened my own practice at twenty. In my forty-eight years of practicing medicine, thirty-eight were spent in the old society. In old China, the medicine of our motherland suffered severe destruction at the hands of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and was in a dying state. I personally experienced many hardships and tasted bitterness. I had no political status in society, and was discriminated against and excluded. The apprentices I personally trained were forced to change professions. The traditional Chinese medicine profession was seen as the "last-place graduate." I wanted to serve society, but I had no power to do so. I remember in 1944, when the Japanese devils ruled, there was a serious epidemic in Yangzhou, but the wicked devils did not allow farmers to enter the city to see a doctor. Seriously ill patients were burned alive if the devils found them. At that time, many patients in the surrounding villages came to me for treatment, but were blocked outside the city. Seeing this situation, it was truly heartbreaking. At that time, I had to secretly take a student out of the city and set up an "open-air clinic" under the Xinbei Men Bridge to diagnose and treat patients. I still remember these encounters vividly.
    After liberation, the earth returned to spring, and our traditional Chinese medicine also came back to life under the leadership of the Party. After liberation, the working people stood up, and our traditional Chinese medicine also stood up. In the new society, the Party and the People's Government attach great importance to health work, and always think about the health of the people. People have become the most valuable wealth of the country. In the course of the victorious development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, our traditional Chinese medicine doctors have gradually organized. Under the education of the Party, my own political consciousness has gradually improved. In May 1955, I entered the Su Bei People's Hospital and began a new life. In December 1956, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, which enabled me to better serve the people under the direct leadership of the Party. In the early period after arriving at the hospital, I was the only one in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine Internal Medicine, and more than one hundred patients registered every day. I would run two or three miles from home to the hospital at five o'clock every morning, and sit down to diagnose and treat patients. Often, I didn't even have time to eat the food my family sent at noon. I thought, "The patients have to walk a long way, so I should treat them and let them go back early!" Sometimes, patients would see that I hadn't eaten until after twelve o'clock and say to me, "Old man, you are treating us, we can't let you go hungry!" and ask me to eat before seeing more patients. In the summer of 1957, one day after twelve o'clock at noon, the outpatient department had stopped registering, but a female patient was carried in from Jiangdu. When I saw her, I thought: "They carried her from so far away, and it's the middle of the day, how can I ask them to wait?" I didn't even bother to rest and immediately treated her. At that time, the clinic was my dining room. At most, I would diagnose and treat one hundred and forty or fifty people a day, often working until dark. The leadership took care of me because I was old and wanted me to take a rickshaw, but I often insisted on walking. In the morning, when the sky was just turning light, I would get up and go to the hospital, and in the evening, I would happily stroll home under the bright lights.
    In order to rescue patients, I often made house calls day and night, responding to every request and never caring about personal gains or losses. Last summer, a child in the Huaisi Commune in Yangzhou was seriously ill, and his parents went to the hospital and specifically asked me to treat him, saying, "As long as Old Man Ren takes his pulse, he will die without regrets." The people trusted me so much, treated me like a family member, and placed their hopes of relieving their suffering on me, which made me feel even more responsible. In my daily work, no matter how busy I am, I patiently listen to patients tell me about their illness and causes, talk to patients in detail to understand their condition, and carefully consider the prescriptions I write, verifying the dosage, and I am not careless in the slightest, so no mistakes have occurred.
    The Party organization is very concerned about me and often tells me to pay attention to rest, but I can't seem to relax. I always think: I should work diligently for the Party, give my heart to the Party, and give my skills to the people. Once, the secretary of the hospital Party committee said to me, "You must listen to the Party and rest well in order to work better for the Party." That night, I tossed and turned in my mind for a long time, and the next morning I ran to the Party committee secretary and said to him, "The leadership wants me to rest, but I feel uneasy, and I can't sleep. Treating fewer patients is like having something stuck in my heart that makes me uneasy." Now I deeply realize that: in the old society, although I was also enthusiastic about medical work, strictly speaking, it was still purely based on "compassion" and based on my own life. But now, under the education of the Party, I realize that medical and health work is a major event that is beneficial to improving people's health, is beneficial to production, work, and study, and is beneficial to promoting socialist construction. Because of the correct leadership of the Party and a clear political direction, my enthusiasm is higher and I am more motivated. I am completely different today from what I was in the old society. I have established a deep class feeling with the working people, which further closely connects me with patients. I regard patients as my own family members, sharing their breath and destiny. As long as it is convenient for patients, I am never afraid of trouble. I use a small notebook to record the patients' conditions for easy reference. Every day after work at noon and before going back in the evening, I take time to go to the ward to see the patients, which has become a habit. When the patient's condition improves, I feel relaxed and happy; when the condition is serious, my heart becomes heavy, and I try every means to treat them. For seriously ill patients who are carried in, I take the initiative to walk out of the clinic to see the patient. Sometimes, when I meet patients on the road who ask for treatment, I happily treat them, never disliking trouble or refusing. One rainy night, I saw a worker named Chen who was ill on my way home, so I held an umbrella in one hand and tore a piece of paper to write a prescription for him. I strive to find prescriptions that "cost less and are highly effective" in order to reduce the economic burden on the working people and restore their health as soon as possible so they can return to their production posts. An elderly worker at the Yangzhou Jade Factory suffered from dysphagia, vomiting after eating. After being treated in the hospital by me, he took two doses of medicine but the vomiting did not stop. I went home in the evening and read books such as "Waitai Miyao" and "Jingyue Quanshu", repeatedly thinking about the treatment method. Finally, I realized that he was old and weak, and strengthening the qi could calm the rebellious qi, so I changed the qi-descending prescription to a qi-tonifying prescription. After taking it, it was indeed effective, and when he got better, he returned to his production post. I felt extremely excited.
    The Party's policy of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine has pointed out a clear direction for our work, enabling us to better relieve the suffering of the people and serve production. When I get along with Western medicine colleagues, I treat them with sincerity and respect each other. We consult each other, cooperate closely, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and dare to take responsibility. Many difficult diseases, such as Xiaoke (diabetes diagnosed by Western medicine), Liver Yang Ascending (hypertension diagnosed by Western medicine), Pikuai Expansion (cirrhosis with ascites diagnosed by Western medicine), and Zhengshui (nephritis diagnosed by Western medicine), have achieved significant results. Here I can give a few examples: In the autumn of 1959, there was a patient with deficiency of both spleen and kidney, and water overflowing the plateau (uremia caused by nephritis), whose condition was critical. He thought he would surely die and called his family to tell them what to do after he died. I participated in the consultation and boldly prescribed a prescription using the method of strengthening the spleen to control water, warming the yang and benefiting the kidney. After the patient took the third dose of medicine, he was able to eat thin porridge, and the edema gradually disappeared. In the summer of 1959, a typhoid patient had a high fever of 41.5 degrees, was in a coma for seven days, and his teeth were tightly clenched. With the help of Western medicine, Chinese medicine was infused through a nasal feeding tube, and saline and cardiotonics were injected, and he was finally rescued. Another time, a three-year-old child suffered from intestinal obstruction and had been carried to the operating room, but the parents requested that he not be operated on. The hospital Party committee asked me to participate in the consultation and seek a treatment method using Chinese medicine other than surgery. Since I started practicing medicine, I have been working in traditional Chinese medicine internal medicine and have never treated surgical patients. At first, I was worried that if something went wrong, it would damage my reputation. But then I thought that doctors should be responsible for their patients, and I am a Communist Party member, so I shouldn't consider personal gains or losses. The idea of personal fame and gain should no longer exist in me today. So, I happily accepted the task assigned by the Party, and according to the principle of "qi movement stagnates and transforms," I adopted a method of regulating qi, bitterly descending, and transforming stagnation for treatment. After the child took my medicine, his safety was on my mind all day long. Before dawn the next day, I hurried to the ward in the dark and saw the little patient sleeping peacefully. I felt relieved, and the joy in my heart was indescribable. After the child recovered, his parents thanked me incessantly. I said to them, "This is my duty, it is what the Party taught me to do, you should thank the Party!"
    I have brought along eighteen apprentices before and after. Sixteen have graduated and are serving the people in their work posts. There are still two apprentices studying with me. I realize that they are the successors of our generation, so I regard the work of teaching apprentices well as a political task. I want to impart all my knowledge and experience to them without reservation. I teach them to read more, think more, ask more, learn while practicing clinically, focus on explaining difficult and complicated diseases, and combine learning theory with clinical practice so that they can better integrate and master the mysteries of traditional Chinese medicine. Because the teaching methods have been improved compared to the past, and the students' learning consciousness has been greatly improved, the apprentices' study period has been shortened and the quality has been improved. In the past, it took six years to study, but now it only takes three or four years to have considerable theoretical knowledge and clinical experience and be able to work independently. I not only teach them technology, but also use my own personal experience to educate them to love Chairman Mao, love the Party, love socialism, and serve patients wholeheartedly. Now two of the graduated apprentices are working with me, and they are both competent in clinical and teaching work, and they have both become glorious Communist Party members.
    In recent years, the Party has given me great honor. Whenever I think about it, I feel very excited. I have been repeatedly rated as an advanced worker in our hospital and in Yangzhou City, attended the Provincial Conference of Representatives of Advanced Health Workers, and was elected as a representative of the Yangzhou People's Congress and a member of the CPPCC. What is particularly unforgettable for me is that last year I was invited to participate in the National Day observation ceremony in the capital to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and I saw our great leader Chairman Mao. The Party has given me unparalleled honor and infinite strength. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party branch, I have been responsible for the leadership and diagnosis and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine internal medicine and the traditional Chinese medicine ward area, and the integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine ward area. I lead by example and work hard, often squeezing out time from ward rounds to conduct outpatient clinics, and I feel great pleasure in treating one more patient. The five comrades in our traditional Chinese medicine department can also work diligently, and in 1959 they were all rated as activists in socialist construction. The integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine ward area is also a "complete success" unit.
    The convening of the National Conference of Heroes in Culture, Education, and Health has given me great encouragement. I have further summarized cases of chronic nephritis, written articles on the treatment of cirrhosis and hepatitis, and researched and developed drugs for the treatment of hypertension and other diseases. With the help of my apprentices, I have also sorted out decades of clinical experience, and the first collection of "Treatment of Jaundice with Chinese Medicine" and "Ren Jiran's Clinical Experience Records" has been published. The second and third collections are currently being sorted out and will soon be printed. This is due to the cultivation and education of the Party, and should be attributed to the Party and Chairman Mao.
    I feel extremely honored to participate in this conference. The congratulatory speech by Comrade Lu Dingyi and the report by Comrade Lin Feng, and the introduction of many representatives' advanced deeds and experiences, have given me great encouragement and education. I must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Mao Zedong, transform myself, resolutely listen to the Party, work diligently for the people, and be a red doctor of the working class. Although I am already sixty-eight years old this year, I have a fiery young heart. I want to continue to boost my energy, strive for the top, conscientiously implement the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy, and work with all medical staff to create a new school of medicine in our motherland and to fight to the end for the cause of communism!

    做工人阶级的红色医师
    江苏省苏北人民医院　任继然
    我是江苏省苏北人民医院的一个中医。我家祖传行医，到我是第十代。我的儿子也是中医，我的孙子也在学医。我今年六十八岁，从十六岁起就跟父亲学医，二十岁单独开诊。在我行医的四十八年中，有三十八年是在旧社会度过的。在旧中国，祖国的医学遭受到国民党反动政府的严重摧残，处于奄奄一息的状态。我个人也是历尽沧桑，饱尝辛酸。在社会上没有政治地位，被歧视，受排斥。自己带出来的徒弟，纷纷被迫改行。中医这一行，被人看作是“末代状元”。自己想替社会服务，也无力可施。记得1944年在日本鬼子统治的时候，扬州疫病严重流行，万恶的鬼子们却不许农民进城看病，重病人被鬼子发现了就活活烧死。当时四乡很多病人找我看病，都被阻在城外，看到这种情景，着实令人心酸。当时我只好偷偷地带个学生出城，在新北门桥下设“露天诊所”，替病人诊治。这些遭遇，我现在记忆犹新。
    解放了，大地回春，我们中医也在党的领导下，起死回生了。解放了，劳动人民翻了身，我们中医也翻了身。在新社会里，党和人民政府十分重视卫生工作，处处为人民健康着想。人，变成了国家最宝贵的财富。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利发展的过程中，我们中医逐步组织起来。在党的教育下，我自己的政治觉悟逐渐提高。1955年5月，我进入苏北人民医院工作，开始了新的生活。1956年12月，我光荣地参加了中国共产党，使我能够在党的直接领导下，更好地为人民服务。刚到医院的一个时期，中医内科只有我一人，每天挂号病人都有一百以上。我每天一早五点钟从家里跑二、三里路到医院，坐下来就给病人诊治，常常中午家里送来饭菜也顾不上吃。我想：“病人还要走很远路哩，治了让他们早点回去吧！”有时病人看到我到十二点多钟还没有吃饭，向我说：“老先生你为我们治病，我们可不能叫你挨饿呀！”要我吃过饭再看病。1957年夏，有一天中午十二点多钟，门诊部已停止挂号了，江都抬来一个女病人，被我看到了，我想：这么远抬来，又是大晌午，怎么叫人家等呢，我也不顾休息了，立即替她看了病。那时诊室就是我的饭堂。最多时，一天诊治一百四、五十人，常常忙到天黑。领导上因我上了年纪，照顾我，要我来往坐人力车，我经常坚持步行。早上东方鱼肚白，就起身到院，晚上，在闪耀的灯光下愉快地漫步回家。
    为了抢救病人，我经常白天、黑夜出诊，有请必应，从不计较个人得失。去年夏天，扬州槐泗公社有个小孩病重，家长到医院指名要我诊治，说：“只要任老先生搭下脉，死而无怨。”人民群众那样地信任我，把我当作亲人，把解除病苦的希望寄托在我的身上，使我越发感到责任重大。在平时工作中，我不管怎样繁忙，我都要耐心听病人诉说病情病因，和病人详细谈话了解病情，开出的处方都要反复斟酌，核实剂量，一点也不马虎大意，所以没有发生过差错。
    党组织非常关心我，经常要我注意休息，可是我怎么也休闲不下来。我总是这样想：我应该勤恳地为党工作，把心交给党，把技术交给人民。有一次，院党委书记对我说：“你要听党的话，好好休息，才能更好的为党工作。”当天晚上我脑子里翻腾了好多时间，第二天一大早就跑去找党委书记，我对他说：“领导上要我休息，我反而不安，觉也睡不着了。我少治了病人就像有一块东西塞在心头使我不安。”现在我深切地认识到：在旧社会里，我虽然也热心于医疗工作，但严格地说来，那还是单纯地从“恻隐之心”出发，从自己的生活出发。可是现在我在党的教育下，认识到医疗卫生工作，是有利于增进人民健康的大事，是有利于生产、工作和学习的大事，是有利于促进社会主义建设的大事。由于有了党的正确领导，有了明确的政治方向，所以，我热情更高，干劲更足。今天的我同旧社会的我已经完全不同。我和劳动人民已经建立起深厚的阶级感情，这更把我和病人紧密地联结在一起，我把病人看成自己的亲人，与病人同呼吸，共命运，只要对病人方便，我从不怕麻烦。我用小本子把病人病情摘录下来，以供随时翻阅。每天中午下班和晚上回去以前，我都要抽空到病房去看看病人，这已经成为习惯。病人病情减轻了，我就轻松愉快；病情严重了，心头就沉重起来，千方百计的设法治疗。对抬来的重病人，都主动的走出诊室到病人身边看病。有时在路上遇到病人要求治疗，我总是愉快地替他们治病，从来没有嫌麻烦或拒绝过。一天晚上下着雨，我在回家的路上看到一个姓陈的工人患病，我就一手撑伞，一手撕了张纸替他开了处方。我努力寻求“花钱少，疗效高”的方剂，以减轻劳动人民经济负担，早日恢复健康，回到生产岗位。扬州玉器厂一位老年工人患膈噎病，吃了东西就呕吐，到医院经我治疗，服药两剂仍未止吐，晚上回家翻阅“外台秘要”、“景岳全书”等书籍，再三思索医治方法，终于想到他年高气虚，气壮可以平息上逆，我就把降气的处方改为补气，服用以后果然有效，病好了，他又走上生产岗位，我感到无比兴奋。
    党的团结中西医的政策，给我们的工作指出了明确的方向，使我们能够更好地为人民解除疾苦，为生产服务。我和西医同志相处，都是以诚待人，互相尊敬。我们相互会诊，亲密合作，取长补短，勇于负责。许多疑难病症，例如消渴（西医诊断的糖尿病）、肝阳上越（西医诊断的高血压）、痞块膨胀（西医诊断为肝硬化腹水）、正水（西医诊断的肾炎）等五十多种疾病都获得了显著的疗效。这里我可以讲几个例子：1959年秋天，有一个脾肾两虚，水泛高原（肾脏炎形成尿毒症）病人，病势危急，他自认必死，把家属喊来嘱咐后事，我参加了会诊，运用补脾制水、温阳益肾法，大胆地开出了处方，病人服了第三剂药后就能吃稀粥，浮肿逐渐消失。1959年夏季，一个伤寒病人，高热达四十一点五度，昏迷七天，牙关紧闭，在西医的帮助下，用鼻饲法灌入中药，注射了盐水和强心剂，终于转危为安，还有一次，一个三岁小孩患肠套迭，已抬到手术房，但家长要求不开刀，院党委要我参加会诊，寻求开刀以外用中药的治疗办法。我从行医以来就是干的中医内科，没有治过外科病人，起初顾虑如果出事要损坏我的名誉。但是我又想到医生对病人应该勇于负责，我是共产党员，更不应该考虑个人得失，个人名利思想今天在我身上不应该再存在了，于是愉快地接受了党交代的任务，按照“气行滞化”的原理，采取理气、苦降、化滞并用的方法进行治疗。小孩服了我的药后，他的安危整日牵挂在我的心上。第二天天未亮，我就摸黑赶到病房，看到小病人安宁地睡着了，我如释重负，高兴的心情真是无法形容。小孩病好后，他的父母不住口的感谢我，我对他们说：“这是我应尽的责任，是党教我做的，你应该感谢党！”
    我前后带了十八个徒弟。已有十六个结业，他们都在工作岗位上为人民服务。现在还有两个徒弟在我身边学习。我认识到，他们是我们这一辈的接班人，因此我把教好徒弟的工作看作是一项政治任务，我要把全部知识和经验毫无保留地传授给他们。我教他们多读书、多想、多问，边学习，边临床，重点讲解疑难病症，把学习理论和临床实践结合起来，使他们更能融汇贯通地掌握祖国医学奥妙。由于教学方法比过去有了改进，加之学生的学习自觉性大大提高，因而徒弟学习期间缩短了，质量提高了。过去要学六年时间，现在只要学三、四年就具有相当理论知识和临床经验，能够独立工作了。我不但教他们学技术，还以我自己的亲身经历，教育他们热爱毛主席，热爱党，热爱社会主义，全心全意为病人服务。现在有两个已结业的徒弟和我在一起工作，他们都能够胜任临床和教学工作，而且他们都已经成为光荣的共产党员。
    这几年来，党给我很大荣誉。一想起来，我内心就非常激动。我曾连续数次被评为本院和扬州市的先进工作者，出席过省卫生先进工作者代表会议，被选为扬州市人民代表和政协委员。特别使我终身难忘的是，去年被邀参加了首都庆祝建国十周年观礼，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。党给了我无上荣誉，也给了我无限力量。近年我在党支部的领导下，负责中医内科和病房中医病区，中西医合作病区的领导和诊疗工作，我自己以身作则，带头苦干，常常挤出查病房的业余时间进行门诊，多治一个病人也感到莫大的愉快。我们中医科的五个同志也都能兢兢业业的工作，在1959年都被评为社会主义建设积极分子，中西医合作病区也是“满堂红”单位。
    全国文教群英大会的召开，给我极大的鼓舞。我进一步总结了慢性肾炎病例，写出了肝硬化及肝炎治疗等等文章，研究制成治疗高血压等疾病的药品。在徒弟的帮助下，我还将数十年临床经验进行了整理，现已经出版了“中药治疗黄疸”和“任继然临床经验录”第一集，第二、三集目前也正在整理，即将付印。这是由于党的培养和教育，应归功于党归功于毛主席。
    参加这次大会，我感到无尚光荣。陆定一同志的祝词和林枫同志的报告，许多代表先进事迹和先进经验的介绍，给我极大的鼓舞和教育。我一定要认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，改造自己，坚决听党的话，勤勤恳恳为人民服务，做一个工人阶级的红色医师。我今年虽然已经六十八岁，但是我有一颗火热的年轻人的心，我要继续鼓干劲，争上游，认真贯彻执行党的中医政策，和全体医务工作人员一道，为创造祖国的新医药学派，为共产主义事业奋斗到底！
