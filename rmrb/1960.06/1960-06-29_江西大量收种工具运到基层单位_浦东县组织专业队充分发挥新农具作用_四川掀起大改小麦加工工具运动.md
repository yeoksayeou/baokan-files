Xinhua News Agency Report: Jiangxi Province has further improved and promoted summer harvesting and planting tools based on the summary of rice transplanters and harvesting tools. At present, the province has rushed to produce more than 410,000 pieces of fast harvesters and rice transplanters, which have all been transported to grassroots production units to participate in summer harvesting and planting.

Since the successful creation of the "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter last winter, Jiangxi Province has a set of advanced tools from planting to harvesting in paddy field operations. More than 100,000 rice transplanters were promoted and used in the early rice transplanting, and the efficiency of rice transplanting was increased by an average of three to five times compared with manual transplanting, and the quality was also high, which guaranteed the more and better planting of early rice this year.

In order to give full play to the role of these tools in summer harvesting and planting, after the early rice transplanting, various places held on-site meetings, symposiums, and representative meetings of rice transplanter operators to summarize the experience of using rice transplanters to transplant early rice, and further took measures to improve the manufacturing and use level of rice transplanters. Shangrao Special District held an on-site meeting for the selection and appraisal of rice transplanters in mid-May to exchange experience in the manufacturing and use of rice transplanters. The whole district decided to rush to produce another 30,000 rice transplanters, striving to use rice transplanters for more than 90% of the late rice. Ganzhou, Yichun, Shangrao, Jiujiang, Fuzhou and other regions have more than 100,000 rice transplanters, and plan to rush to produce another 50,000 rice transplanters, so that 30% to 50% of the late rice can be transplanted with rice transplanters.

In terms of harvesting tools, various places have vigorously promoted advanced tools such as fast harvesters, threshers, and field transport vehicles. Ruijin, Xingguo, and Dingnan counties in the Ganzhou Administrative Region organized more than 3,000 machinery factories and agricultural tool factories to rush to produce and repair 30,000 fast harvesters, more than 14,000 threshers, and more than 90,000 various field transport vehicles.

Our newspaper Shanghai, June 28th: Pudong County, Shanghai, adopted the method of organizing professional teams when promoting rice transplanters, so that the county's rice transplanters were fully used in the summer planting upsurge, giving full play to their role, and effectively ensuring the timely and good transplanting of late rice.

Establishing professional teams to ensure the application and play of new agricultural tools is the conclusion reached by the Pudong County Party Committee after comprehensively summarizing the experience of using new agricultural tools twice in early rice transplanting and summer harvesting threshing. During the early rice transplanting this year, although the county also made 250 rice transplanters, because the rice transplanters were used by the production teams in a decentralized manner at that time, and the commune members were not yet proficient in operating technology, they could not solve some technical problems and mechanical failures in time; in addition, some cadres and commune members had conservative ideas, so the rice transplanters could not give full play to their effectiveness. However, in the process of using threshers during the summer harvest, due to the organization of a strong professional team, and the strengthening of political and ideological work, the threshers showed great power, ensuring the completion of the county's summer harvest task one week ahead of schedule. Therefore, according to this experience, the Pudong County Party Committee emphasized that in order to make the rice transplanters play a role in the late rice transplanting, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education for commune members, and at the same time, it is necessary to establish a professional technical team.

Although the late rice transplanting task in Pudong County this year is only more than 25,000 mu, due to the tight time and high requirements, and the summer management task is very heavy, the labor force feels quite tight. As early as before the late rice transplanting began, the county trained 1,000 rice transplanter operators and formed a lean rice transplanter professional team. The county party committee also established a late rice transplanting headquarters composed of the county agricultural machinery bureau (responsible for rice transplanter manufacturing), the industry bureau (responsible for rice transplanter repair), and the agriculture bureau (responsible for rice transplanter operator training).

Our newspaper Chengdu, June 28th: A tool reform movement of "every commune has a steel mill, every team has a stone mill" is being launched in rural Sichuan. As of early June, the province's rural areas have adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance to manufacture more than 200,000 various hydraulic, animal-powered mills, steel mills, and improved mills, with a daily output of more than 49 million jin of flour, ensuring that more than 80% of the province's agricultural population needs to eat flour.

This year, Sichuan's spring crops have had a good harvest. In the next two or three months, wheat will be the main food ration in rural areas. Solving the problem of wheat processing has become a major event related to the people's lives and supporting the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, the popularization of public canteens and the expansion of canteen scale also require the reform of processing tools to meet the needs of collective consumption. In response to this situation, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee specifically issued instructions, requiring all localities to vigorously grasp the reform and manufacturing of rural milling tools. All thirteen special districts in the province have established rural grain processing leading institutions, which are jointly responsible for solving the problem of processing tools by the planning commission, grain, agricultural machinery and other departments.

In the process of vigorously grasping the processing of spring grain, all localities have also paid attention to concentrating the wisdom of the masses to create new tools. According to incomplete statistics, the province has created and improved more than 20 kinds of processing tools. These tools have the characteristics of simple structure, flexible operation, low cost, high efficiency, and easy promotion.

At the same time, all localities regard the reform of grain processing tools as an important part of agricultural technology transformation, closely combine it with rural product processing, and vigorously engage in diversified operations to achieve multiple functions in one factory. The spring grain processing factories built in Mianyang, Neijiang, Daxian and other regions can not only grind flour, but also mill rice, extract oil, process miscellaneous grains and refined feed.

    江西大量收种工具运到基层单位
    浦东县组织专业队充分发挥新农具作用
    四川掀起大改小麦加工工具运动
    据新华社讯　江西省各地在总结插秧机和收割工具的基础上，进一步提高和推广夏收夏种工具，目前，全省已赶制快速收割机和插秧机等四十一万多件，并已全部运到基层生产单位，参加夏收夏种。
    江西省自去冬“江西五十九型”插秧机创制成功后，在水田作业方面从种到收已有了一套先进工具。全省在早稻插秧时推广使用了十多万部插秧机，插秧工效平均比手工插秧提高了三至五倍，质量也高，保证了今年的早稻多种和种好。
    为了在夏收夏种中充分发挥这些工具的作用，在早稻插秧结束后，各地就分别召开了现场会、座谈会、插秧机机手代表会等，总结使用插秧机栽插早稻的经验，并进一步采取了措施提高插秧机的制造与使用水平。上饶专区在5月中旬召开了插秧机的选型鉴定现场会，交流插秧机的制造与使用经验。全区确定再赶制三万部插秧机，争取90％以上的晚稻都用插秧机插秧。赣南、宜春、上饶、九江、抚州等地区已有十多万部插秧机，计划再赶制插秧机五万部，这样使30％到50％的晚稻能用插秧机插秧。
    收割工具方面，各地大力推广了快速收割机、脱粒机、田间运输车子等先进工具。赣南行政区的瑞金、兴国、定南等县组织了三千多个机械厂和农具厂赶制和修理了快速收割机三万部，打谷机一万四千多部，各种田间运输车子九万多部。
    本报上海28日电　上海市浦东县在推广插秧机时，采取组织专业队伍的方法，使全县插秧机在夏种高潮中全面运用，充分发挥作用，有力地保证晚稻适时插秧，做到又快又好。
    建立专业队伍保证新式农具的运用和发挥作用，是中共浦东县委全面总结了早稻插秧和夏收脱粒两次使用新式农具的经验后得出的结论。今年早稻插秧时，全县虽也做了二百五十部插秧机，但由于当时插秧机由生产小队分散运用，社员操纵技术还不熟练，碰到一些技术问题和机械故障就无法及时解决；加以部分干部和社员有保守思想，因而插秧机不能充分发挥效用。而在夏收期间运用脱粒机的过程中，由于组织了一支强有力的专业队伍，同时加强政治思想工作使脱粒机大显威风，保证全县夏收任务提前一星期完成。因此，中共浦东县委根据这个经验，强调指出，要使插秧机在晚稻插秧中发挥作用，一面要对社员加强政治思想教育，同时必须建立一支专业的技术队伍。
    今年浦东县的晚稻插秧任务虽然只有二万五千多亩，但由于时间紧、要求高，夏管任务又十分繁重，因而劳动力颇感紧张。早在晚稻插秧开始前，全县就培养训练了一千名插秧机手，组成了一支精悍的插秧机专业队伍。县委并成立了由县农业机械局（负责插秧机制造）、工业局（负责插秧机检修）和农业局（负责插秧机手的培训）等单位参加的晚稻插秧指挥部。
    本报成都28日电　四川农村正掀起一个社社有钢磨、队队有石磨的工具改革运动。截至6月上旬，全省农村采取土洋结合、自力更生的办法，已制造出各种水力、畜力磨、钢磨、改良磨等二十多万台，日产面粉四千九百多万斤，保证了全省80％以上的农业人口吃面需要。
    今年，四川小春作物收成良好，今后两、三个月内，小麦将是农村的主要口粮。解决好小麦加工问题，已成为当前关系群众生活、支援农业生产持续跃进的大事。同时，公共食堂的普遍化和食堂规模的扩大，也要求改革加工工具，以适应集体消费的需要。针对这一情况，中共四川省委专门发出指示，要求各地大抓农村磨面工具的改革和制造。全省十三个专区都成立了农村粮食加工领导机构，由计委、粮食、农业机械等部门协同负责解决加工工具问题。
    在大抓小春粮食加工中，各地还注意了集中群众智慧创造新工具。据不完全统计，全省创造和改良的加工工具达到二十多种。这些工具都具有构造简单、操作灵便、花钱少、工效高、容易推广的特点。
    同时，各地都把粮食加工工具改革看成农业技术改造的一个重要组成部分，密切结合农村产品加工，大搞多种经营，做到一厂多能。绵阳、内江、达县等地区兴建的小春粮食加工厂，除了磨面外，还可以碾米、榨油、加工杂粮和精饲料。
