    Go to the Mines!
    Leading comrades going up the mountains and down the pits, personally grasping the mining industry, this is an extremely important move to ensure a great increase in steel production.
    Steel is the main raw material for the machinery industry and capital construction. Its importance in the entire national economy is clear to everyone. However, to develop the production capacity of the steel industry, it is not enough to rely solely on the smelting capacity of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces. It also depends on the mining capacity of raw materials such as ore and coking coal. According to the current production situation in our country, it takes about 2.5 to 3 tons of iron ore and 3 to 4 tons of coking coal to refine one ton of pig iron. “Before the troops move, food and fodder go first.” Iron ore, coal mines, etc., are the raw materials of raw materials, the first of the first, and the mining industry should be placed in the first place and receive the leadership's attention first. In order to ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed and well-nourished, there should also be some reserves. Leading cadres should devote more energy to grasping mining work than to grasping blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. Secretaries should not only sleep by the furnace, but also sleep in the mines. Leaders should go deep into the front line of production, not only into blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, sharing food, lodging, labor, and discussions with steelworkers, but also deep into the mines, sharing food, lodging, labor, and discussions with miners, and working with workers and technicians there to cultivate experimental plots, summarize experiences, and promote experiences. The mining industry is a link that particularly needs to be strengthened at present. The production conditions of mines are generally worse than those of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, and it is even more necessary for leading cadres to go to the mines themselves and go deep into the front line of mining. Only in this way can we grasp the key to continuous leap forward in production.
      “The secretary sleeps by the furnace, and one furnace ignites ten thousand furnaces,” which shows that no matter what the problem is, as long as the leadership grasps it, it can be quickly solved. The mining industry is also like this. As long as the leaders go deep into the mines and personally grasp it, it will inevitably move forward at a faster pace. The facts reflected in the news from Shandong Province, Hubei Daye, and other mines published in this newspaper today are the most powerful proof.

### 到矿山去！

    到矿山去！
    领导同志上山下坑，亲自抓采掘工业，这是确保钢铁生产大增长的极重要的一着。
    钢铁是机械工业和基本建设的主要原材料，它在整个国民经济中的重要性，是大家都清楚的。但是，要发展钢铁工业的生产能力，光靠平炉、高炉的冶炼能力是不行的，还要靠矿石、焦煤等等原料的采掘能力。根据我国目前的生产情况来看，每炼一吨生铁，大约需要二吨半到三吨的铁矿石，三吨到四吨焦煤。“兵马未动，粮草先行”。铁矿、煤矿等等，是原料中的原料，是先行中的先行，采掘工业应该摆在第一位，首先受到领导的重视。为了保证高炉吃得饱、吃得好，还要有点储备，领导干部应该拿出比抓高炉、平炉更大的精力来抓采掘工作。书记不仅睡到炉边去，更要睡到矿山去。领导深入生产第一线，不只要深入到高炉和平炉，和炼钢炼铁工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，更要深入矿坑，和矿工同吃同住同劳动同商量，和那里的工人、技术人员一起种试验田，总结经验，推广经验。采掘工业是当前特别需要加强的一个环节，矿山的生产条件一般比高炉、平炉差一些，更特别需要领导干部亲自到矿山去，深入采掘的第一线。这样，才能抓住生产持续跃进的关键。
      “书记睡到炉边去，一炉升火万炉红”，这说明不论什么问题，只要领导一抓，就能够很快得到解决。采掘工业也是这样，只要领导深入矿坑，亲自抓一抓，就必然以更快的步伐前进，今天本报发表的山东省、湖北大冶以及其他矿山的新闻所反映的事实，就是最有力的证明。
