Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Hong'an County, Hubei Province, famous throughout the country for cultivating experimental plots, has for four years consistently maintained the practice of moving its county committee offices to production teams. This practice not only broke free from the circle of routine affairs, but more importantly, effectively guided the central tasks of each period, promoting continuous leaps forward in production.

The Hong'an County Committee Office moved to a production team in 1957. Before that, the office cadres mainly made phone calls, listened to reports, and requested forms, rarely going to the countryside. After the spirit of the Eighth Central Committee's Second Plenary Session was conveyed, in 1957, cadres throughout the county began to change their work style, participating in production and leading production. The county party secretary and more than twenty county committee members took the lead in carrying their luggage to the countryside, and the office also moved to the Jiansu Production Team. This was the county committee's key work area. The office gained experience in this key area and disseminated it in a timely manner; it identified problems and promptly sought instructions and resolved them on the spot. Thus, it became the Party Committee's capable staff department for directing work and the command post on the production front lines. For example, during last year's autumn planting, some advocated a large seed quantity, while others advocated a small seed quantity; some advocated wide-row strip planting, while others wanted narrow-row line planting... Opinions were very inconsistent. The office listened to the opinions of the masses and summarized the practical experience of cultivating experimental plots over the years, unified six technical specifications for sowing, immediately convened an on-site meeting, mobilized the masses to discuss, and then promoted the above experience. Because the office went to the countryside and delved into reality, it had ample time to conduct investigations and research. Of the eight cadres in the County Committee Office, one or two were long-term conducting investigations and research below, acting as scouts and conducting circuit inspections. By doing so, they could both solve problems and grasp the situation in a timely manner, making the work more in-depth, more specific, and more meticulous, thereby avoiding bureaucratic, subjectivist, and formalist leadership methods and work styles. Paperwork and meetings were also greatly reduced. According to preliminary statistics, the number of documents in the nearly three years from 1958 to the present is only equivalent to the number of documents in 1956 alone.

Driven by the County Committee Office, the Party Committee Offices of all eight communes in the county also moved to production teams to work, delving into reality with the secretaries. Consequently, solving problems and guiding work became accurate, specific, and timely. In mid-June, at the crucial moment of vigorously pursuing topdressing and weeding of mid-season rice, and vigorously promoting the ripening of mid-season rice to catch up with early rice, all localities generally reported a shortage of fertilizer. The Huahe Commune Party Committee, after conducting key comprehensive inspections, proposed specific measures. The commune secretary set an example, cadres took the lead, and 5,000 people were organized to go up the mountains to cut green manure, harvesting 1.5 million jin of "golden strips" in three days, and topdressing 3,500 mu. The County Committee then promptly called for a concentrated effort to cut green manure and accumulate fertilizer to ensure that seedlings were upgraded. Within a few days, the entire county mobilized men and women to go up the mountains, cutting green manure and topdressing 12 million jin. Cadres and the masses reflected: "In the past, it was: you had to go through several levels for something, and you would not hear back after waiting; now it is: the experience is promoted overnight, and problems are solved as soon as they arise."

    红安县委四年坚持在生产队办公
    解决问题准确具体及时
    新华社武汉讯　以种试验田闻名全国的湖北省红安县，县委四年如一日地坚持把办公室搬到生产队安家落户，这样作不仅跳出了事务圈子，更重要的是有力地指导了各个时期的中心工作，对生产连年持续跃进起了促进作用。
    中共红安县委办公室是1957年搬到生产队去的。在这以前，办公室的干部主要是打电话，听汇报，要报表，很少下乡。党的八届二中全会精神传达以后，1957年，全县干部开始转变作风，参加生产，领导生产。县委书记和二十多名县委委员带头背着行李下乡，办公室也搬到了建苏生产队。这里是县委的工作重点，办公室在这个重点取得经验，及时传播；发现问题，及时请示、就地解决。从而成为党委指挥工作的得力参谋部，生产前线上的指挥所。例如去年秋种中，有人主张种子量大，有人主张种子量小；有人主张宽幅条播，有人要窄幅线播……意见很不一致，办公室听取了群众意见，又总结了几年来种试验田的实际经验，统一了六条播种技术规格，立即召开了现场会议，发动群众讨论，然后推广了上述经验。由于办公室下到了农村，深入了实际，就有充分的时间进行调查研究，县委办公室八个干部长期有一、二人在下面调查研究，当侦察兵，巡回检查。这样做，既能解决问题，又能及时掌握情况，使工作越做越深入，越做越具体，越做越细致，从而避免了官僚主义、主观主义和事务主义的领导方法和工作作风，文牍和会议也大大的减少了。据初步统计，从1958年到现在近三年来的文件，只相当于1956年一年的文件数量。
    由于县委办公室的带动，全县八个公社的党委办公室也都搬到生产队办公，跟书记一起深入实际，因而解决问题和指导工作都做到了准确、具体、及时。6月中旬，正是大搞中稻追肥锄草，猛催中稻成熟赶早稻的关键时刻，各地普遍反映肥料不足，华河公社党委经过作出重点全面检查，提出具体措施，全公社书记做样板，干部带头干，组织五千人上山打青，三天割“黄金条”一百五十万斤，追肥三千五百亩。县委又及时号召突击打青积肥，确保禾苗升级，几天内，全县发动男女上山，打青追肥一千二百万斤。干部和群众反映是：“过去是：有事要过几道关，一等两等没着落；现在是：推广经验不过夜，有了问题就解决”。
