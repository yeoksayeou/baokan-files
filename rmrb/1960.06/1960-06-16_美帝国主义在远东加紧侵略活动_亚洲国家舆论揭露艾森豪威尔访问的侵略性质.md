Xinhua News Agency Report: Public opinion in various countries continues to expose the aggressive nature of Eisenhower's trip to the Far East.

    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Says:
    Korean People Will Publicly Try Eisenhower for His Crimes
    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 15th, saying: Eisenhower, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, Wall Street's top lackey, and warmonger, came to South Korea for a "visit" to intensify the tense situation in the Far East, drag South Korea into a new aggressive bloc with Japan as its core, and encourage the desperate Heo Jeong group. This is a blatant challenge to the Korean people and a new and vicious criminal act.

    The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower's arrival in South Korea will inevitably arouse greater anger among the South Korean people. Apart from Syngman Rhee and Heo Jeong, American running dogs, who else would be willing to "welcome" a butcher like Eisenhower!

    The commentary emphasized that US imperialism launched the Korean War, massacred countless Korean people, forcibly occupied half of Korea, and imposed hunger and poverty on the South Korean people. Eisenhower is the number one criminal for all these crimes of the US imperialist aggressive bloc. The Korean people are determined to publicly try Eisenhower for all his crimes.

    Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" Says:
    US Imperialism is the Culprit of South Korea's Tragedies
    Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on the 15th, saying: Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea can only further arouse the hatred of the South Korean people and promote the struggle movement against US imperialism and its running dog, the Heo Jeong group.

    The commentary pointed out that in the course of their struggle, the South Korean people have gradually realized that US imperialism is their most dangerous enemy and the main culprit in creating all the tragedies in South Korea. After overthrowing the reactionary Syngman Rhee, the South Korean people saw that the situation cannot fundamentally change as long as US imperialism is entrenched in South Korea and the dictatorial system established by US imperialism in South Korea has not been abolished. Therefore, the South Korean people have begun to direct their spearhead at US imperialism and its running dog, the Heo Jeong group.

    The commentary said: "The purpose of the 'highest-level' American robber's visit to South Korea is nothing more than to stop the ever-rising struggle of the South Korean people, instigate the new puppet group of the United States in South Korea to use the most vicious means to intensify war preparations, and consolidate the US position in South Korea." The commentary also pointed out: "Eisenhower's planned visit to the US troops stationed near the 38th parallel is part of the United States' new provocative plan in the Far East."

    The commentary believes that the South Korean people will not be deceived by Eisenhower's sweet words. The commentary said, "To eradicate the grass, one must remove the roots. As long as the South Korean people continue their persistent and courageous struggle, further develop it, and resolutely strike at the United States and its most reactionary running dogs, they will achieve greater victories."

    Indonesian "Dongxing Bao" Says:
    Collusion Between US and Japanese Reactionaries Will Ultimately Fail
    Indonesian "Dongxing Bao" commented on Eisenhower's trip to Japan on the 15th, saying that Eisenhower and Nobusuke Kishi's forced implementation of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" will only make Japan's political crisis more serious, accelerate the total collapse of imperialism and reactionaries, and also bring the Japanese people's anger and hatred towards the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States to a new climax.

    The newspaper pointed out that the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" not only poses a threat to peace in Japan but also to peace in the Pacific and the world. This treaty provides convenience for US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to carry out expansion. The newspaper pointed out that such collusion between US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries will ultimately fail in the face of the people of all Asian countries.

    Burmese "New Era Newspaper" Says:
    Eisenhower's Trip to Japan Endangers World Peace
    Burmese newspapers continue to condemn Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Japan.

    The famous Burmese commentator, Shawana, pointed out in the "Mirror Daily" on the 14th, "The actions he (Eisenhower) is taking now are tantamount to putting a rope around his own neck."

    The commentary said that the real reason for the current demonstrations by the Japanese people is not only because they oppose the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Kishi Nobusuke government, but also because they fundamentally oppose American policies.

    The commentary said that because the Japanese people were the first to suffer the harm of American atomic bombs, they not only do not want such things to happen again, but also sincerely hope that the people of other countries will not suffer the pain they suffered in the past when opposing the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    The commentary refuted the American propaganda that the current anti-American patriotic movement of the Japanese people is so-called Communist "incitement." The commentary said, "The United States should reconsider what it is doing. ... It is an undeniable fact that the United States interferes in the internal affairs of other countries."

    Burmese "New Era Newspaper" published an editorial saying, "The whole world will draw a clear conclusion: the US-Japan treaty is very unpopular in Japan." The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower's trip to Tokyo poses a serious danger to world peace.

    Cambodian "Unity Newspaper" Says:
    Eisenhower's Arrival in the Far East Aggravates Tensions
    Cambodian "Unity Newspaper" said on the 15th that the purpose of Eisenhower's "visit" to the Far East is to further aggravate the tense situation in Asia, to encourage their puppets, so as to more closely prepare for war.

    The newspaper praised the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against US imperialism and the militaristic Kishi Nobusuke group, and strongly condemned the US attempt to tie Japan to its war chariot through the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to launch a war of aggression against People's China and other Asian countries.

    The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle will reach a climax when Eisenhower arrives in Tokyo in order to drive Eisenhower out of Japan.

    The newspaper said that the Cambodian people will always stand with the Japanese people and fight against the common enemy of imperialism. The Cambodian people are determined to fully support the Japanese people's struggle for peace and the safeguarding of sovereignty.

    "Cambodian Telegraph" editorial today pointed out that the Japanese people are opposed to binding Japan to Uncle Sam's war chariot, and Uncle Sam seems to want to launch a new world war.

    The editorial believes that Eisenhower's ignoring the voice of the Japanese people is a "major, dangerous, and irreparable mistake."

    Lebanese "Al-Shaab" Says:
    Eisenhower's Visit Aims to Intensify the Cold War
    Lebanese "Al-Shaab" published an editorial on the 14th, saying that Eisenhower, regardless of the will of the people of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and other countries in the Far East, insisted on visiting this region with the purpose of intensifying the "Cold War" in the Far East.

    The editorial said that Eisenhower's purpose in visiting the Far East is also to: on the one hand, conspire to deploy new provocations, and on the other hand, attempt to strengthen the position of the United States and the rulers of those countries who are bound to the chariot of US imperialism.

    The editorial said, "Eisenhower is going to the Far East under the responsibility of undermining the summit meeting and being responsible for carrying out aggressive and provocative plans, but he will face the people of all countries who hate aggression, yearn for peace, and have raised their vigilance."

    The newspaper finally said, "Since Eisenhower's advance party was chased and escaped the people's anger by helicopter, perhaps Eisenhower himself will have to be forced to do so. What is the value of Eisenhower's plans when they are precisely to discuss these plans with the rulers of these angry people?"

    美帝国主义在远东加紧侵略活动
    亚洲国家舆论揭露艾森豪威尔访问的侵略性质
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续揭露艾森豪威尔远东之行的侵略性质。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    朝鲜人民要公审艾森豪威尔的罪行
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”15日发表评论说：朝鲜人民的死敌、华尔街的头号奴才、战争贩子艾森豪威尔来南朝鲜“访问”的目的，是为了加剧远东紧张局势、把南朝鲜拉进以日本为核心的新的侵略集团，给陷入绝境的许政集团打气。这是对朝鲜人民的公然的挑战，是新的恶毒的犯罪行为。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔来南朝鲜必然会激起南朝鲜人民更大的愤怒。除了李承晚和许政等美国走狗以外，还有谁愿意“欢迎”像艾森豪威尔这样的刽子手头子！
    评论强调指出，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，屠杀了无数的朝鲜人民，强占着朝鲜的一半土地，把饥饿和贫穷强加于南朝鲜人民。艾森豪威尔就是美帝国主义侵略集团这一切罪行的头号罪犯，朝鲜人民坚决要公审艾森豪威尔的种种罪行。
    越南“人民报”说
    美帝国主义是南朝鲜惨祸的元凶
    越南“人民报”15日发表评论说：艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜“访问”只能进一步激起南朝鲜人民的愤恨，促进反对美帝国主义及其走狗许政集团的斗争运动。
    评论指出，南朝鲜人民在斗争过程中已经逐渐地看清了美帝国主义是他们最危险的敌人，是制造南朝鲜一切惨祸的元凶。南朝鲜人民在推翻了反动的李承晚之后看到，当美帝国主义还盘踞南朝鲜，当美帝国主义在南朝鲜设立的独裁制度还未被废除的时候，局势还不能发生根本的变化。因此，南朝鲜人民已经开始把矛头指向美帝国主义及其走狗许政集团。
    评论说：“美国‘最高级’的强盗到南朝鲜的目的，不外乎要阻止正在不断高涨的南朝鲜人民的斗争，唆使美国在南朝鲜的新的傀儡集团使用最毒辣的手段来加紧准备战争，巩固美国在南朝鲜的地位。”评论还指出：“艾森豪威尔打算去访问美国在三八线附近驻军的行动，是美国在远东新的挑衅计划的一部分。”
    评论相信，南朝鲜人民不会被艾森豪威尔的甜言蜜语所欺骗。评论说，“拔草必须除根，只要更猛烈地、更坚决地打击美国和它的最反动的走狗，南朝鲜人民坚持不懈的、勇敢的斗争，一定会进一步发展，会取得更大的胜利。”
    印度尼西亚“东星报”说
    美日反动派勾结最后必将失败
    印度尼西亚“东星报”15日评论艾森豪威尔的日本之行说，艾森豪威尔和岸信介强行推行新日美“安全条约”只会使日本的政治危机更加严重，加速帝国主义和反动派的总崩溃，同时也将使日本人民对岸信介政府和美国的愤怒和痛恨进入新的高潮。
    这家报纸指出，新日美“安全条约”不仅形成对日本和平的威胁，也是对太平洋和世界和平的威胁。这个条约为美帝国主义和日本反动派进行扩张提供了方便。报纸指出，美帝国主义和日本反动派这种勾结最后必将在亚洲各国人民面前遭到失败。
    缅甸“新时代报”说
    艾森豪威尔日本之行危害世界和平
    缅甸报纸继续谴责艾森豪威尔即将对日本的访问。
    缅甸著名的评论家沙瓦那在14日的“镜报”上指出，“他（艾森豪威尔）现在所采取的行动等于是把绳子往自己的脖子上套。”
    评论说，日本人民目前举行示威的真正原因，不仅仅是由于他们反对新日美“安全条约”和岸信介政府，而且是由于他们根本反对美国的政策。
    评论说，由于日本人民首先遭受美国原子弹的危害，他们不仅不希望再发生这样的事情，而且在反对新日美“安全条约”的时候，真诚地希望其他国家的人民不致遭受他们过去遭受的痛苦。
    评论驳斥了美国宣传的日本人民当前的反美爱国运动是所谓共产党“煽动”的论调，评论说，“美国应当重新考虑，它自己在干些什么。……美国干涉其他国家的内政是一个无可否认的事实”。
    缅甸“新时代报”发表社论说，“全世界将得出明确的结论：美日条约在日本非常不得人心。”社论指出，艾森豪威尔的东京之行对于世界和平有严重的危险。
    柬埔寨“统一报”说
    艾森豪威尔到远东加剧紧张局势
    柬埔寨“统一报”15日说，艾森豪威尔“访问”远东的目的，是在于进一步加剧亚洲的紧张局势，给他们的傀儡们打气，以便更加紧进行战争准备。
    这家报纸赞扬日本人民反对美帝国主义和军国主义的岸信介集团的英勇斗争，并且强烈谴责美国企图通过新日美“安全条约”把日本拴在它的战车上，以便对人民中国和其他亚洲国家发动侵略战争的阴谋。
    这家报纸指出，日本人民的斗争将在艾森豪威尔到达东京的时候进入高潮，以便把艾森豪威尔赶出日本。
    这家报纸说，柬埔寨人民永远和日本人民站在一起，同共同的敌人帝国主义进行斗争，柬埔寨人民决心完全支持日本人民争取和平和维护主权的斗争。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”今天的社论指出，日本人民反对把日本缚在山姆大叔的战车上，而山姆大叔看来是想发动新的世界战争的。
    社论认为，艾森豪威尔无视日本人民的声音，是犯了“重大的、危险的、不可弥补的错误”。
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”说
    艾森豪威尔访问目的是加剧冷战
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”14日发表社论说，艾森豪威尔不顾日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾以及远东各国人民的意志而执意到这个地区去进行访问，其目的是为了加剧远东的“冷战”。
    社论说，艾森豪威尔访问远东的目的还在于：一方面阴谋部署新的挑衅，另一方面企图加强美国的地位和把自己缚在美帝国主义战车上的那些国家的统治者的地位。
    社论说，“艾森豪威尔是在应对破坏最高级会议负责和对进行侵略、挑衅计划负责的情况下到远东去的，但是，他将面对憎恨侵略、渴望和平而且已经提高了警惕的各国人民”。
    报纸最后说，“既然艾森豪威尔的先行官被追乘直升飞机逃避人民的愤怒，也许艾森豪威尔本人也要被迫这样做，而他们正是要同这些愤怒的人民的统治者去讨论这些计划，那么艾森豪威尔的这些计划还有什么价值可言呢？”
