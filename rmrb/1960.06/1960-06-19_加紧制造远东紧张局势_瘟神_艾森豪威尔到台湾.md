Xinhua News Agency, June 18th, Taipei Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower, who is on a robber-like trip to the Far East, arrived in Taipei this morning, beginning his conspiracy to intensify hostility towards the Chinese people, continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, and escalate tensions in the Far East.

Eisenhower made a brief statement at Songshan Airport. He said he "looks forward to fruitful talks with Chiang Kai-shek" and expressed "respect" for the "rapid progress made on this island." He clamored for the Chiang Kai-shek clique to strengthen cooperation with the United States, saying that in the face of the "threat of communist imperialism," "we (the US and Chiang) need to be vigilant and strengthen cooperation" in order to have "a world of freedom, just peace and friendship." Eisenhower also said, "I personally assure you that the United States firmly supports you and your government (referring to Chiang)."

However, even as Eisenhower was boasting about supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a group of pro-American elements in Taiwan, including Lei Chen, Gao Yushu, and Li Wanju, who are supported by the United States, announced the establishment of an anti-Chiang "new political party" on the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in Taiwan. Traitor Liao Wenyi clamored that "the United Nations should directly supervise Taiwan." According to Agence France-Presse, on the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in Taipei, anti-Chiang slogans appeared in several places in Taipei.

It is reported that the scene at Taipei Airport upon Eisenhower's arrival was very cold, and only some officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique welcomed him. United Press International reported, "This was the coldest welcome Eisenhower has received, except for Afghanistan." It is said that due to strict security measures, there were fewer people welcoming him. "Only some people who were necessary for a ceremony and some military personnel were present."

Eisenhower will hold two talks with Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon and tomorrow morning. According to U.S. news agencies, they will discuss the general international situation and U.S.-Chiang relations. Specific topics of discussion include U.S. military "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek, the issue of providing the Chiang Kai-shek clique with new weapons, and the U.S. conspiracy to cobble together a Northeast Asian aggressive military bloc.

Eisenhower arrived in Keelung around 9 a.m. aboard the cruiser "Saint Paul" and then transferred to Taipei by helicopter. On his way from Manila to Taiwan, this "plague god," who is creating tension throughout the Far East, mobilized a large number of warships and combat aircraft to "escort" him in the face of the Asian people's surging anti-American struggle. At the same time, the U.S. naval and air forces in the Taiwan Strait were all on "alert," and they instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army to also prepare for "combat" to "protect" the U.S. president.

    加紧制造远东紧张局势
    “瘟神”艾森豪威尔到台湾
    新华社18日讯　台北消息：在远东进行强盗旅行的美国总统艾森豪威尔今天上午抵达台北，开始他的加紧同中国人民为敌，继续霸占中国领土台湾，加紧制造远东紧张局势的阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔在松山机场上发表了一个简短的声明。他说他“期望同蒋介石进行有成果的交谈”，并且对于“在这个岛屿上取得的迅速进展”表示“敬意”。他叫嚣要蒋介石集团加强同美国合作，说什么为了要“有自由、正义的和平和友谊的世界”，在“共产帝国主义的威胁面前，需要我们（美、蒋）提高警惕和加强合作”。艾森豪威尔还说，他“亲自向你们保证：美国坚定地支持你们和你们的政府（指蒋）。”
    但是，就在艾森豪威尔扬言支持蒋介石集团的同时，一批受美国豢养的包括雷震、高玉树和李万居等人在内的台湾亲美分子在艾森豪威尔抵台前夕宣布成立了一个反蒋的“新政党”。汉奸廖文毅叫嚷“联合国要对台湾进行直接的监督”。据法新社报道，在艾森豪威尔抵达台北前夕，在台北好几个地方还出现了反蒋标语。
    据报道，艾森豪威尔在到达台北机场时的场面很冷淡，欢迎他的只有蒋介石集团的一些官员。合众国际社消息说，“这是除了阿富汗以外艾森豪威尔受到过的最冷清清的一次欢迎”。据说，由于严密的保安措施，欢迎的人较少。“在场的只有一些对一个仪式来说是必需的人和一些军事人员。”
    艾森豪威尔今天下午和明天上午将同蒋介石举行两次会谈。据美国通讯社报道，他们将讨论一般国际局势和美蒋关系问题。会谈的具体议题包括美国对蒋介石的军事“援助”，给予蒋介石集团新式武器的问题，以及美国拼凑东北亚侵略性军事集团的阴谋等。
    艾森豪威尔是在上午九时许乘“圣保罗号”巡洋舰抵达基隆，然后改乘直升飞机到达台北的。在从马尼拉前往台湾途中，这个在远东各地制造紧张局势的“瘟神”，在亚洲人民气势磅礴的反美斗争的形势下，动员了大批军舰和作战飞机来为他“护驾”。同时，美国在台湾海峡的海空军全部处于“戒备状态”，并且指使蒋介石集团的军队也作好“战斗准备”，以“保护”这个美国总统。
