Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 22nd: Huang Da, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, held a banquet last night to warmly bid farewell to Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, and other distinguished guests, who are about to conclude their friendly visit to China.

At the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, the hosts and guests enthusiastically raised their glasses to wish the Chinese and Albanian people, under the brilliant banner of Marxism-Leninism, to be united like steel and advance victoriously forever; and to wish the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, built on the foundation of proletarian internationalism, to last forever.

Saifudin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Luo Shigao, Chinese Ambassador to Albania; Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Li Huang and Li Dongye, Secretaries of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Ning Wu, Che Xiangchen, Chen Xianzhu, Gong Tianmin, and Chu Fengqi, Vice Governors; Liu Baotian, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor; General Chen Xilian, Head of the Shenyang Garrison; and responsible persons of local organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations in Liaoning Province all attended the banquet.

Vice Governor Huang Da spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that the hardworking and brave Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, have achieved brilliant accomplishments in various struggles and socialist construction. The victory of the Albanian people is our victory, the victory of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. Every one of our victories is a powerful blow to the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, and a contribution to the cause of maintaining world peace.
