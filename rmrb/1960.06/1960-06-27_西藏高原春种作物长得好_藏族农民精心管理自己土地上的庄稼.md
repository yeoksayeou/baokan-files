    The crops on the Tibetan Plateau are growing very well. Highland barley and wheat are jointing, heading, and flowering, while rapeseed, peas, and broad beans are blooming and setting pods. Tens of thousands of leading cadres have gone deep into the front lines of production, eating, living, and laboring with the farmers, seizing the time for field management, and striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    This year, during the spring planting, farmers in various regions generally improved their farming techniques, achieving deep plowing, fine soil preparation, sufficient water, and adequate fertilizer. Many places also implemented seed selection and row planting, followed closely by seedling inspection and replanting. As a result, the highland barley and wheat seedlings are growing uniformly, strongly, and particularly lush. During tillering, the situation of one seed per plant in previous years is no longer present, with generally five or six tillers per plant. Tens of thousands of mu (one mu is approximately 0.16 acres) of high-yield fields across the region have increased the number of plants per mu by one to four times compared to previous years. After spring sowing, agricultural production mutual aid teams in various regions established specialized field management teams for water management, topdressing, weeding, and pest control, establishing a responsibility system with layers of responsibility, carrying out tasks thoroughly. Many counties also held agricultural technology training classes, training a large number of field management technical personnel. Farmers who previously never hoed or loosened the soil have now become field management technicians. Locally produced fertilizers and pesticides are also being manufactured in large quantities. In May alone, farmers in Mozhugongka, Gonggar, Nimu and other counties eliminated more than 100,000 field mice using local pesticides.

    This newspaper reports: In Jiama District, Qonggyai County, Tibet, professional teams were organized in field management, giving full play to the role of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers, and significant results have been achieved in field management.

    After the end of sowing and the emergence of seedlings, Jiama District quickly launched a mass field management campaign centered on seedling inspection, replanting, seedling protection, and seedling preservation. In order to give full play to the role of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers, both to do a good job in the current seedling inspection and replanting and to prepare for mid-term and late-term management, each township and village in the district organized five field management professional teams for water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and topdressing, soil loosening and weeding, grazing, and pest control.

    After half a month of hard work, stone walls were built and thorny hedges were put up along the roads for more than 680 li (one li is approximately 0.31 miles), ensuring that cattle, sheep, and donkeys would stay on the mountains and the crops would not be damaged. The district has irrigated 3,480 ke (one ke is approximately one mu), accounting for 68% of the total area, and loosened the soil and weeded 4,900 ke, accounting for 95.7% of the total area. Thus, the victory of full seedling emergence was achieved. (Attached picture)

    In the Shannan region of Tibet, with the victory of democratic reform, the enthusiasm of the farmers who have stood up on the agricultural production front has been unprecedentedly high. Extensive farming has gradually been replaced by intensive farming.

    西藏高原春种作物长得好
    藏族农民精心管理自己土地上的庄稼
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏高原上的庄稼长得很好，青稞、小麦正在拔节、抽穗和扬花，油菜、豌豆、蚕豆正在放花结荚。成千上万个领导干部深入生产第一线，与农民同吃同住同劳动，抓紧田间管理，争取今年大丰收。
    今年春耕播种时，各地农民普遍改进了耕作技术，做到了耕深、土细、水饱、肥足，许多地方还实行了选种、条播，紧跟着又是查苗、补苗，因此青稞、小麦苗齐苗壮，长得特别茂盛。在分蘖时，往年一籽一株的状况已不复存在，一般都分蘖五、六株。遍布各地的数万克（一克相当于一亩）丰产田，每克株数都比往年增加一倍到四倍。春播后，各地农业生产互助组纷纷成立水利、追肥、拔草、除害等田间管理专业队伍，建立责任制度，层层负责，一抓到底。许多县还开办农业技术训练班，训练出大批田间管理技术人材。过去从来不会锄草松土的农民，现在成了田间管理的技术员。土化肥、土农药也开始大量制造。仅墨竹工卡、贡噶、尼木等县农民，在5月间就用土农药消灭田鼠十多万只。
    本报讯　西藏穷结县加麻区，在田间管理工作中，组织专业队，充分发挥了半劳力和辅助劳力的作用，田间管理取得了显著的成绩。
    播种结束、幼苗开始出土后，加麻区迅速开展了群众性的以查苗、补苗、护苗、保苗为中心的田间管理运动。为了充分发挥半劳力和辅助劳力的作用，既做好当前的查苗补苗工作，又为中期和后期管理工作作好准备，全区各乡、村都组织了兴修水利、积肥追肥、松土除草、放牧、除害捕虫等五个田间管理专业队。
    经过半个月奋战，在大路两旁用石头垒墙、用刺柴围边达六百八十余华里，作到了牛羊毛驴上山，保证庄稼不受糟蹋。全区已浇地三千四百八十克，占到总面积的68％，松土除草四千九百克，占到总面积的95．7％。从而，取得全苗关的胜利。（附图片）
    西藏山南地区，随着民主改革的胜利，在农业生产战线上站起来了的农民，生产热情空前提高。粗放的耕作已逐步地被精耕细作所代替。这是乃东县泽东乡农民在播种后，又把地耙平，以利于出苗齐整和灌溉。新华社记者  赵家烈摄
