    US Diplomacy Repeatedly Suffers Defeats; Eisenhower is Reproached Everywhere
    Soviet "Pravda" Comments on the US President's Visit to the Far East
    Eisenhower is a Gendarme of Asia
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd: The Soviet "Pravda" today published a commentary on Eisenhower's conclusion of his Far East trip, saying that America's adventurous policies are facing bankruptcy one after another. Eisenhower's failed visit to the Far East is another clear demonstration.
    The commentary said that Eisenhower ended his Far East trip, which aroused worldwide ridicule, and rushed back to the United States. Newspapers around the world, with a rare degree of consensus, believe that America's adventurous policy has suffered a defeat.
    First, the military agreements and military base policy of the American aggressive bloc have been hit. The United States is urging Japan and the US Congress to quickly ratify the US-Japan military treaty, but now the whole world clearly sees that the US military treaty system has been defeated because the people hate this kind of military treaty.
    Second, as foreign newspapers have pointed out, the result of Eisenhower's disgraceful trip to the Far East thoroughly exposed Eisenhower himself as a defender of colonialism, a gendarme of Asia, and a protector of shameful puppet regimes.
    Third, the failure of Eisenhower's visit to the Far East shows the world that the United States' position as the so-called "leader of the Western world" is wavering.

### 苏联“真理报”评美国总统远东之行  艾森豪威尔是亚洲的宪兵

    美国外交连遭失败　艾森豪威尔到处受斥
    苏联“真理报”评美国总统远东之行
    艾森豪威尔是亚洲的宪兵
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“真理报”今天就艾森豪威尔结束他的远东之行发表评论说，美国的冒险政策正在接二连三地遭到了破产。艾森豪威尔这次访问远东的失败，又是一个鲜明的证明。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔结束了引起全世界嘲笑的远东之行，提前赶回了美国。全世界报刊以从来少见的一致认为，美国的冒险政策遭到了失败。
    第一，美国侵略集团的军事协定、军事基地政策受到了打击。美国催促日本和美国的国会迅速批准日美军事条约，但是，现在全世界都清楚地看到，美国的军事条约体系已经遭到了失败，因为人民憎恨这种军事条约。
    第二，正如外国报刊所指出的，艾森豪威尔在远东进行的丢丑旅行的结果，彻底暴露了艾森豪威尔自己是殖民主义的捍卫者，是亚洲的宪兵，是可耻的傀儡政权的保护者。
    第三，艾森豪威尔访问远东的失败向全世界表明了，美国作为所谓“西方世界的领袖”的地位正在动摇。
