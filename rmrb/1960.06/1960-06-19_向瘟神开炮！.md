    Fire on the God of Plague!
    Yuan Ying
    The Taiwan Strait's waves surge, stirring up a Force 12 typhoon. In the cannon fire, the earth shakes and mountains tremble; in the blazing light, mountains echo with the roar of the sea. The heroic cannons are roaring, the heroic soldiers are shouting in anger: Eisenhower, get out of here, fire! American invaders, get out of Taiwan, fire! Get out of Japan, fire! Get out of Korea, fire! Get out of Asia, fire! We must liberate our motherland's territory of Taiwan, fire! Down with American imperialism, fire! Fire! Fire! Fire on the god of plague! Fire on the ferocious and barbaric robbers, fire on the public enemy of the world's people, fire on the number one war criminal!
    In June 1950, the United States forcibly occupied Taiwan by armed force. In June 1960, the American army is still clinging to Taiwan. Taiwan, the pearl of the motherland, is plunged into the mud and stained with blood; Taiwan, the treasure island of the motherland, is a sea of fire and heavy disaster. Sisters of Taiwan, you gaze towards the mainland until your tears run dry; brothers of Taiwan, you have lit the flames of hatred. Taiwan has always had volcanoes, and now the volcanoes are about to erupt. Wrongs have their heads, debts have their owners, blood debts must be repaid in blood!
    Brothers and sisters of Taiwan, more than 600 million compatriots are by your side, and powerful armed forces are by your side. Listen, the sound of thousands of cannons shake the earth, and the roar of hundreds of millions of people echoes to the sky, to make the god of plague lose his soul, to make the war criminals tremble with fear. To make them understand: the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Chinese territory is not to be invaded!
    The Taiwan Strait's waves surge, stirring up a Force 12 typhoon. For the sake of the brothers and sisters of Taiwan, fire! For the blood on the streets of Tokyo, fire! For the anger in Seoul and Busan, fire! For the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, fire on Eisenhower, fire on American imperialism! Fire! Fire! Fire!
          June 18, 1960
