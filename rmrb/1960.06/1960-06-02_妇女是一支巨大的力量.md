Women are a Tremendous Force
Saitō Yoshie, Chairperson of the Women's Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association

The strength of Japanese women in opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has gradually grown over the past decade through struggles against reactionary forces and opposition to U.S. military bases. In recent years, there have been many instances of Japanese women actively participating in struggles. The woman mayor in her forties who stood at the forefront of the struggle against the U.S. military base in Hyakurigahara, Ibaraki Prefecture, is one example. After an incident in Gunma Prefecture where a U.S. soldier killed a poor peasant woman without cause, women throughout the prefecture rose up in indignation to fight. Recently, in the struggle of coal miners at the Miike Coal Mine in Omuta City, Kyushu, against the tyranny of capitalists, the "Housewives' Council" fought heroically. In the movement of the people of Tokyo against the expansion of the U.S. military base in Sunagawa Town near Tokyo, many women from Tokyo also participated in the ranks of the struggle. Of course, participation in these struggles is not limited to women in Ibaraki Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, Kyushu, and Tokyo. These struggles have received support from women and people all over the country and have become a national struggle.

These struggles have laid the foundation for the struggle of Japanese women against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" today.

To facilitate understanding for the readers, I would like to introduce some information about the struggle of Japanese women against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" from the following aspects.

First, the "Women's Council for the Defense of Human Rights" can be regarded as the core force in the struggle of women against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This organization was established during the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law." It includes women's groups such as the "Mothers' Assembly Liaison Committee," women's departments of various progressive political parties, women's departments of "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), women's departments of neutral trade unions, and groups such as the Japan-China Friendship Association. It has become a backbone force of the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty."

Second, in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the "'Security Treaty' Criticism Group" organized by prominent cultural figures such as Kenzo Nakajima has also played a significant role. Female critics such as Yoko Matsuoka and Sumiko Tanaka, actresses such as Chieko Higashiyama and Teruko Kishi, and female poets such as Sumako Fukao have actively joined this organization and enthusiastically participated in mass rallies, petition movements, and demonstrations.

Third, female Christians have also risen up to participate in the struggle. Members of grassroots organizations of groups such as the Young Women's Christian Association and the Women's Christian Temperance Union are acting with firm conviction and carrying out propaganda to those around them in small-scale gatherings and other activities held in various places.

Fourth, the Women Lawyers Association and the Women's Human Rights Protection League (composed of female lawyers, female prosecutors, and female judges) are conducting activities against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" from their respective work positions. They have issued statements and petitioned the Diet.

Fifth, not all women's groups that the conservative party has tried to win over agree with the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Some of them have already actively risen up to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Today, Japanese women are carrying out diverse struggles, either individually or jointly through these organizations, to oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." There are 2.25 million more women with the right to vote in Japan than men. I have always believed that if the broad masses of women earnestly engage in struggle, then the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will not be difficult to crush. This is why we are trying to mobilize more women to rise up and fight.

    妇女是一支巨大的力量
    日中友好协会妇女委员会委员长  斋藤喜枝
    日本妇女反对日美“安全条约”的斗争力量，是在过去十年来同反动势力斗争和反对美国军事基地的斗争中逐步成长起来的。几年来，日本妇女积极参加斗争的事例是很多的。站在茨城县百里原反对美国军事基地斗争前列的，就是一位四十多岁的女镇长。在群马县发生美国大兵无故杀死一位贫农妇女的事件后，全县妇女义愤填膺起来进行斗争。最近在九州大牟田市三池煤矿工人反对资本家暴行的斗争中，“主妇协议会”英勇地进行斗争。在东京人民反对美军扩充东京附近的砂川町基地运动中，也有很多的东京妇女参加了斗争的行列。参加这些斗争的当然不仅仅限于茨城县、群马县、九州和东京的妇女。这些斗争受到全国各地妇女和人民的支援，成了全民性的斗争。
    这些斗争，为今天日本妇女反对日美“安全条约”的斗争打下了基础。
    为了便于读者理解起见，我想从下列几方面来介绍日本妇女反对日美“安全条约”斗争的一些情况。
    第一，在妇女反对日美“安全条约”斗争中堪称为核心力量的是“保卫人权妇女协议会”。这个组织是在反对修改“警职法”的斗争中建立起来的。它包括了“母亲大会联络委员会”等妇女团体、各进步政党的妇女部、“总评”的妇女部、中立工会妇女部和日中友好协会等团体。它成了“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的一支骨干力量。
    第二，在反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中，由中岛健藏等著名文化界人士组织的“‘安全条约’批判会”也起了巨大的作用。松冈洋子、田中寿美子等女评论家，东山千荣子、岸辉子等女演员，深尾须磨子等女诗人积极加入了这个组织，并且踊跃地参加群众集会、请愿运动和示威游行。
    第三，女基督教徒也起来参加了斗争。基督教女青年会、基督教妇女矫风会等团体的基层组织的会员们，个个都抱着坚定的信心行动起来，在各地举行的小规模集会等活动中，向自己周围的人进行宣传。
    第四，妇女法律家协会、妇女拥护人权同盟（由女律师、女检察官、女审判员等法律工作者组成），从各自的工作岗位上进行着反对日美“安全条约”的活动。它们发表了声明，并向国会进行请愿。
    第五，在保守党极力拉拢的妇女团体中，也不是个个都赞成日美“安全条约”的。其中有的已经积极起来反对新日美“安全条约”。
    今天，日本妇女正在通过这些组织，进行着单独的或者是联合的多种多样的斗争，来反对日美“安全条约”。日本有选举权的妇女比男人多二百二十五万人。我一向认为，如果广大妇女认真起来进行斗争，那么，日美“安全条约”是不难粉碎的。这就是我们为什么要设法动员更多的妇女起来斗争的原因所在。
