Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement early this morning declaring that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is "invalid, illegal, and politically unreasonable." The Socialist Party emphasized that it does not recognize that this treaty has "naturally come into effect."

The statement said, "Given the circumstances of the treaty's debate in the Diet, the content of the treaty, and the principles of democratic government, our party does not recognize that the Diet has approved this treaty."

The statement pointed out that, first, the events of May 19th and 20th clearly show that in the process of debate in the House of Representatives, the Diet Law, the House of Representatives Regulations, and many established norms regarding parliamentary procedure were completely disregarded. Therefore, the new "Security Treaty" is legally invalid.

The statement continued: Secondly, this treaty violates the Japanese Constitution and the United Nations Charter. Because according to this treaty, Japan must provide the United States with a portion of its territory and facilities, and guarantee to take military action with the United States to help the United States achieve its military objectives, and is obliged to maintain combat forces.

The Socialist Party said that this treaty cannot be binding, nor can it have authority, because the Japanese people strongly oppose this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement early this morning declaring that the so-called "natural coming into effect" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is invalid. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Nobusuke Kishi group has announced that the "Security Treaty" came into effect at midnight on June 18th. This was announced by Nobusuke Kishi and a small group of followers who, supported by U.S. imperialism, have consistently ignored the Japanese people's extreme anger towards them.

In all respects, the new treaty is invalid.

First, the new treaty is an aggressive military treaty, and the conclusion of this treaty violates the Japanese Constitution.

Second, the so-called passage of this treaty by the House of Representatives and the resolution on the so-called extension of the Diet session are obviously invalid. Since even the House of Representatives has not approved this treaty, there is no question of a so-called "natural coming into effect."

We reiterate that the new treaty has no binding force on the Japanese people, and there is no such thing as the "natural coming into effect" of this treaty.

As everyone knows, the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the holding of general elections are the unanimous demands of the Japanese people. Only the Kishi Nobusuke group ignores these demands. Yesterday's massive demonstration of 640,000 people in Tokyo clearly demonstrated that the entire Japanese people are united in supporting these demands.

We call on all Japanese people to strengthen the struggle to win the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the formation of a caretaker cabinet composed of all parliamentary forces other than the Kishi Nobusuke group, and to hold general elections under the supervision of this cabinet. We call on the people to use this method to crush the "Security Treaty." At the general strike scheduled for June 22nd, the Japanese people will fully demonstrate their determination to fight along this path.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued a statement shortly after midnight on the 18th, saying that the General Council of Trade Unions and the entire Japanese people do not recognize that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has "naturally come into effect."

The statement said, "The only measure that Kishi Nobusuke should take is to resign along with all his cabinet members, dissolve the Diet, and leave this issue to the people to decide, and not take provocative measures such as unilaterally passing laws related to this treaty or exchanging instruments of ratification." The statement said: "The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan declares that it will fully devote itself to the battle to crush the new Security Treaty, defend the peaceful constitution, and establish a democratic parliamentary government."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: The news that the traitorous Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government brazenly announced at midnight on the 18th that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" had "naturally come into effect" angered the Japanese demonstrators who were holding a sit-in in front of the Diet.

At that time, Tanaka Toshio, a member of the Diet from the Japanese Socialist Party, came out of the Diet building and delivered a short speech to the 5,000 students and workers who were still holding a sit-in there. Tanaka said that the Socialist Party does not recognize the so-called "natural coming into effect" of the "Security Treaty." He guaranteed that the Socialist Party would wage an unyielding struggle to crush the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The enraged sit-in demonstrators, after listening to his speech, began to march towards Kishi Nobusuke's "official residence." The roads nearby were already crowded with 30,000 to 40,000 students holding a sit-in.

Student leaders told the people gathered there that we feel unparalleled anger at this moment. Let us surround Kishi Nobusuke's residence with a thick wall of people to express our protest, so that not even the smallest ant can get in.

They called on workers and citizens to stay there all night and fight with the students.

When the students saw signs that Kishi Nobusuke was attempting to slip out through the back door, they rushed there to prevent him from escaping.

United Press International acknowledged that Kishi Nobusuke was at that time "virtually a prisoner."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: Yesterday in Osaka, Japan, 150,000 people participated in five consecutive mass rallies in Otemae Park. This was a day of unprecedented numbers in the Osaka people's movement against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The meeting passed a resolution protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's repressive measures against the demonstrators, demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

### 日本社会党、共产党、总评发表声明  不承认日美条约已经“自然成立”  东京数万群众愤怒包围首相“官邸”抗议岸信介集团卖国罪行

    日本社会党、共产党、总评发表声明
    不承认日美条约已经“自然成立”
    东京数万群众愤怒包围首相“官邸”抗议岸信介集团卖国罪行
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天凌晨发表声明，宣布新日美“安全条约”是“无效的、非法的、在政治上是无理的”。社会党强调说，它不承认这个条约已经“自然成立”。
    声明说，“鉴于这个条约在国会辩论时的情况，条约的内容以及民主政府的原则，我党不承认国会已经批准这个条约”。
    声明指出，第一，5月19日和20日发生的情况清楚地说明，在众议院进行辩论的过程中，国会法、众议院条例和许多已经确立的关于国会议事程序的准则都被完全置于不顾。因此新“安全条约”在法律上是无效的。
    声明继续指出：其次，这个条约违反了日本宪法和联合国宪章。因为根据这个条约，日本要提供美国一部分领土和设施，并保证同美国一起采取军事行动来帮助美国达到它的军事目的，并有义务保持作战力量。
    社会党说，这个条约不可能有约束力，也不可能有权力，因为日本人民都强烈反对这个条约。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天凌晨发表声明，宣布新日美“安全条约”的所谓“自然成立”是无效的。声明全文如下：
    岸信介集团宣布，“安全条约”在6月18日午夜成立。这是由得到美帝国主义支持的、一直无视日本人民对他们的极度愤怒的岸信介和一小撮追随者宣布的。
    从各方面来说，新条约都是无效的。
    第一，新条约是侵略性的军事条约，这项条约的缔结违反了日本宪法。
    第二，众议院所谓通过这项条约同所谓延长国会会期的决议显然都是无效的。由于甚至连众议院也没有批准这项条约，因此根本谈不到所谓“自然成立”。
    我们再次声明，新条约对日本人民没有任何约束力，也不存在像这个条约的“自然成立”之类的东西。
    大家知道，岸信介内阁辞职，解散国会和举行大选是日本人民一致的要求。只有岸信介集团无视这些要求。昨天东京举行的六十四万人的大示威就清楚地证明，全体日本人民都团结一致地支持这些要求。
    我们号召全体日本人民加强斗争，争取岸信介内阁辞职，解散国会和成立除了岸信介集团以外的所有国会力量组成的看守内阁，并在这一内阁监督下举行大选。我们号召人民用这种办法来粉碎“安全条约”。在预订于6月22日举行的总罢工的时候，日本人民将充分显示他们要沿着这条道路进行斗争的决心。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会在18日午夜后不久发表声明说，工会总评议会和全体日本人民不承认日美“安全条约”已经“自然成立”。
    声明说，“岸信介应该采取的唯一措施，是同他的全体内阁阁员一起辞职，解散国会，把这个问题交给人民来决断，并且不要采取如片面通过有关这个条约的法律或交换批准书之类的挑衅性措施。”声明说：“日本工会总评议会宣布，它将全力投入战斗来粉碎新安全条约，保卫和平宪法和建立一个民主的议会政府。”
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介卖国政府在18日午夜悍然宣布新日美“安全条约”已经“自然成立”的消息激怒了在国会前面举行静坐示威的日本示威群众。
    当时，日本社会党国会议员田中稔男从国会大厦里出来，向仍然在那里举行静坐示威的五千名学生和工人发表简短的讲话。田中说，社会党不承认所谓“安全条约”的“自然成立”。他保证社会党将进行不屈不挠的斗争，来粉碎日美军事同盟条约。
    被激怒了的静坐示威者在听完他的讲话后，开始列队走向岸信介的“官邸”。那里附近的道路上已经挤满了举行静坐示威的三、四万名学生。
    学生领袖向聚集在那里的人说，我们此刻感到无比的愤怒。让我们用厚实的人墙包围岸信介的住所来表示我们的抗议，要使得连一只最小的蚂蚁也进不去。
    他们呼吁工人和市民们通夜呆在那里，同学生一起斗争。
    学生们在看到岸信介有企图从后门溜走的迹象时，曾经赶到那里去阻止他逃跑。
    合众国际社承认，岸信介当时“实际上已经成为一个囚犯”。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本大阪市昨天有十五万人参加了在大手前公园连续举行的五次群众大会。这是大阪人民反对新日美“安全条约”运动中人数空前多的一天。大会通过决议，抗议岸信介政府对示威群众的镇压措施，要求废除新“安全条约”、岸信介内阁全体辞职、立即解散国会。
