Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today released a draft of its future struggle policy. It stipulates that this trade union, with 3.6 million members, will fight to abolish the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," eliminate U.S. military bases, restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and strive for peace, independence, and democracy.

    The draft policy first analyzes the international and domestic situation. It states: "Through the struggle against the Security Treaty, the vast majority of the Japanese people have resolutely expressed their opposition to the Security Treaty and declared that they do not recognize the amended Security Treaty. Although the Liberal Democrats insist that the treaty has come into effect, the Japanese people who refuse to support this treaty have seriously shaken the Security Treaty system."

    "Under these circumstances, it is possible to render the Security Treaty completely invalid in practice. The working masses, led by the working class, will do everything possible to prevent the Security Treaty from having binding force." "Therefore, the duty of the working class is to cooperate with peasants, ordinary citizens, and cultural workers to effectively strengthen the struggle to practically cancel the Security Treaty."

    Referring to the current struggle of workers, the draft states: "In the past year, the Japanese working class movement has made unprecedented progress. No one had expected the struggle against the Security Treaty to be so massive." "In the process of the anti-Security Treaty movement, we have learned that, as long as we proceed prudently, trade unions can win public support when they take strong action. We have also learned that this is the way to unite the broadest sections of the people around the working class movement."

    "We have seen that when the broad masses of people stand up and take action, the so-called public security laws are virtually worthless. We are convinced that when the overwhelming majority of the people use actions to show that they reject the Security Treaty, this new Security Treaty will be practically abolished."

    The draft struggle policy also stipulates the future struggle goals of Sohyo. In terms of striving to improve living standards, Sohyo will strive to fundamentally increase wages, establish a national unified minimum wage system of 8,000 yen per person, improve the social insurance system, oppose so-called "enterprise rationalization," demand shorter working hours, and achieve full employment.

    When discussing the struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, the draft states that Sohyo will strive to abolish the new "Security Treaty," neutralize Japan, defend the Peace Constitution, conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union as soon as possible, restore diplomatic relations with China, withdraw U.S. troops from Japan, abolish U.S. bases in Japan, and return Okinawa to Japan.

    The draft struggle policy states that the working class should stand at the forefront of the people's movement to achieve the above goals and victoriously smash the reactionary propaganda that so-called political strikes are illegal. The draft states that Sohyo will do its best to expand the existing joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty" to include the majority of residents in the joint struggle organizations.

    Regarding Sohyo's attitude towards political parties, the draft states: "Sohyo supports the Socialist Party. However, Sohyo is prepared to cooperate with all progressive political parties on specific issues."

    Regarding the issue of unifying the labor front, the draft states: "Sohyo will develop unified action with the Federation of Independent Unions to further pursue a policy of merging with it. As for the All-Japan Congress of Trade Unions, Sohyo is willing to develop joint action with it on specific issues, but will not relax its efforts to oppose the various separatist actions taken by the All-Japan Congress of Trade Unions."

    This draft struggle policy will be submitted to the National Congress to be held in Tokyo from August 2 to 6 for discussion and adoption.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has combined the struggles to defend Japan's national sovereignty, oppose war, strive for peace, and safeguard democracy. He said that because this struggle relies on a united front, it has achieved great success.

    Shiga made these remarks at a lecture meeting held by the Japanese Communist Party on the evening of the 28th to eight hundred activists in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Shiga pointed out that only by relying on the power of the people to force the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" and other related domestic laws to be unenforceable and even abolish these treaties, agreements, and laws, can the Japanese people see the prospects for a socialist revolution. He said that the Japanese people have already taken action, and they will surely shatter the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system!

    Shiga strongly condemned Eisenhower for slandering the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" as a "plot of international communism" in his report on his Far East trip. Shiga said that this statement is exactly the same as Kishi Nobusuke's. Their view of the nationwide struggle in Japan is doomed to failure and has already failed.

    Hakamada Satomi, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized at the meeting that the Japanese people must not only declare that they do not recognize the new "Security Treaty," but also strive to abolish it. This is the primary task of the future struggle, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity of member organizations of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Professor Suzuki Masashi of Aichi University emphasized in his speech that the Japanese people's struggle is full of bright prospects.

    Suzuki refuted the fallacy spread by the Japanese bourgeoisie propaganda machine that peaceful coexistence and opposition to imperialism are "mutually contradictory." He pointed out that the struggle for peaceful coexistence and the struggle against imperialism are consistent. Since the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries issued two declarations in Moscow in 1957, this truth has been repeatedly proven.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: Yesterday afternoon, more than 10,000 workers and people from all walks of life in Kanagawa Prefecture held a meeting in Fujimi Park, Kawasaki City, and unanimously passed a resolution declaring that they did not recognize the new "Security Treaty," demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and opposing the transfer of power from Nobusuke Kishi to another person similar to Nobusuke Kishi.

    This meeting was convened by the Kanagawa Prefecture Conference Against the "Security Treaty."

    Two thousand workers from Nippon Kokan Company, Yawata Electric Company, and Yokohama Shipbuilding Company also participated in the meeting despite police persecution.

    In the resolution, the conference also declared that the workers of Kanagawa would oppose any attempt to suppress workers with powerful strikes and demanded the immediate release of arrested workers.

    After the meeting, the participants held a parade in the city. Passersby applauded them to show their support for their struggle. The marching crowd shouted: "We reject the Security Treaty!" "We want to smash the repressive measures!" "Release the arrested workers immediately!". The demonstration continued until 8 p.m.

    取消日美条约和美军基地就能保证日本的独立和平
    日本总评决定团结广泛力量加强共同斗争
    志贺义雄在日共演讲会上说只有依靠人民力量才能废除日美条约
    神奈川万人集会要求立即解散国会并反对第二个岸信介内阁上台
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天发表了今后的斗争方针草案。它规定，这个拥有三百六十万会员的工会将为废除新日美“安全条约”、取消美军基地、恢复日中邦交、争取和平、独立和民主而斗争。
    斗争方针草案首先分析了国际和国内的形势。它说：“通过反对安全条约的斗争，绝大多数日本人民断然表示反对安全条约，并且声明他们不承认经过修改的安全条约。虽然自由民主党人硬说条约已经生效，但是拒绝支持这个条约的日本人民已经严重地震动了安全条约体系。”
    “在这种情况下，是可能在实际上使安全条约完全无效的。以工人阶级为首的劳动群众将竭尽全力以防止安全条约产生拘束力。”“因此，工人阶级的职责所在是同农民、普通市民以及文化工作者进行合作，有效地加强斗争来在实际上取消安全条约”。
    谈到工人的当前斗争时，草案说：“在过去一年中，日本工人阶级的运动有了空前的进展。过去谁也没有料想到反对安全条约的斗争这样声势浩大。”“在反对安全条约运动的过程中，我们懂得了，只要审慎从事，工会在采取坚强的行动时是能够赢得舆论的支持的。我们也懂得了，这就是把最广大的人民各阶层团结在工人阶级组织的运动的周围的办法。”
      “我们看到，当广大人民群众站起来采取行动时，关于所谓公安的法令实际上形同废纸。我们确信，当占压倒多数的人民用行动表示他们拒绝安全条约的时候，这个新安全条约将在实际上被废除”。
    斗争方针草案还规定了“总评”今后的各项斗争目标。在争取提高生活水平方面，“总评”要争取从根本上提高工资，建立每人八千日元的全国统一的最低工资制度和改进社会保险制度；并且反对所谓“企业合理化”，要求缩短工时和实现充分就业。
    草案在谈到争取和平、独立和民主的斗争时说，“总评”将努力争取取消新“安全条约”，使日本中立，保卫和平宪法，早日同苏联缔结和约，恢复同中国的邦交，使美军撤出日本，取消美国在日本的基地，使冲绳归还给日本。
    斗争方针草案表示，工人阶级应当站在争取实现以上目标的人民运动的最前列，胜利地粉碎所谓政治罢工是非法的这种反动宣传。草案说，“总评”将尽力扩大现有的反对“安全条约”的共同斗争组织以便把大部分居民包括到共同斗争组织中。
    关于“总评”对政党的态度，草案说：“总评支持社会党。但是总评准备在具体问题上同所有的进步政党合作。”
    关于统一劳工阵线问题，草案说：“总评将发展同中立工会联合会的统一行动来进一步奉行同它合并的政策。至于全日本工会会议，总评愿意在具体问题上发展同它的共同行动，但是并不放松它反对全日本工会会议所采取的各种分裂主义行动的努力。”
    这个斗争方针草案将提交定于8月2日至6日在东京召开的全国代表大会讨论通过。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄强调指出，日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争已经把保卫日本民族主权、反对战争、争取和平以及维护民主等各项斗争结合在一起，由于这一斗争的展开依靠了统一战线，所以获得了巨大成就。
    志贺这番话是在28日晚上在日共举行的演讲大会上对八百名反对日美“安全条约”斗争积极分子说的。
    志贺指出，只有依靠人民力量迫使新日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”以及其他有关国内法律不能付诸实施以至废除这些条约、协定和法律以后，日本人民才能看到社会主义革命的前景。他说，日本人民已经行动起来了，他们必将粉碎日美“安全条约”体系！
    志贺强烈谴责艾森豪威尔在他的远东之行报告中诬蔑日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争是“国际共产主义的阴谋”。志贺说，这种说法完全和岸信介一样，他们这样看待日本全民性的斗争，就注定要失败，而且已经遭到了失败。
    日共中央干部会委员袴田里见在会上强调指出，日本人民不仅宣布不承认新“安全条约”，而且必须争取废除这项条约，这是今后斗争的首要任务。他强调阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议成员团体加强团结的重要性。
    爱知大学教授铃木正四在讲演中强调指出日本人民的斗争充满着光明前途。
    铃木驳斥了日本资产阶级宣传机构胡说什么和平共处和反对帝国主义是“互相矛盾”的谬论。他指出，争取和平共处的斗争和反对帝国主义的斗争是一致的。自从各国共产党和工人党1957年在莫斯科发表了两个宣言以来，这个真理一再被证明。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本神奈川县一万多名工人和其它各界人民昨天下午在川崎市富士见公园举行大会，一致通过决议，宣布不承认新“安全条约”，要求立即解散国会，并且反对把政权从岸信介手中转移给另一个类似岸信介的人。
    这个大会是由神奈川县反对
  “安全条约”会议召开的。
    日本钢管公司、八欧电机公司和横滨造船公司的二千名工人不顾警察的迫害也参加了大会。
    大会在决议中还宣布，神奈川的工人们将以强有力的罢工来反对任何镇压工人的企图，并要求立即释放被捕的工人。
    大会结束后，与会者在市内举行了游行。路上行人都向他们鼓掌，表示支持他们的斗争。游行群众高呼：“我们拒绝安全条约！”“我们要粉碎镇压措施！”“立即释放被捕的工人！”。示威一直继续到晚上八点钟。
