    Guangzhou Daxin People's Commune Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Front Lines
    Grasp Production, Grasp Planning, Grasp Measures, and Promote a Great Leap Forward in Commune-Run Industrial Production

    (According to our report) The main leading cadres of the Guangzhou Daxin People's Commune went deep into the production front lines to lead production, solved many key problems in the commune-run industry, and promoted the production of industry. In May, the total output value of commune-run industry was 348% of that in April before the establishment of the commune, exceeding the total output value of street industry in this area in the first quarter of this year by 22%.

    In order to rapidly improve the level of commune-run industry and carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the Daxin People's Commune Party Committee decided that leading cadres should go deep into the production site to personally grasp production, grasp planning, and grasp measures. They divided the commune-run industry into five areas according to region and industry, and the main leading cadres of the commune were assigned to lead them, to ensure that the plans and measures of the commune Party committee could be accurately and timely implemented.

    In many commune-run factories, after the commune's leading cadres went deep into the production leadership, they quickly focused on the weak links and key issues in the factory, breaking through a number of technical innovation projects that played a decisive role in production. After the leaders of the commune went deep into the filament factory to convey the commune Party committee's deployment on carrying out the "four modernizations" movement, the employees of the commune-run filament factory immediately focused on the backward link of manually grinding wire eyes in the factory, organized forces to fight for two days, and imitated an electric wire eye grinding machine, which increased work efficiency eleven times, solving the key problem in the factory's production. The factory's production in May increased by more than two times compared with April.

    After the commune's leading cadres went deep into the production site, they knew the ideological trends of the masses and the problems existing in production, and therefore were able to effectively help the masses solve some ideological problems that hindered the leap forward in production, as well as some practical problems in production. After the secretary of the commune Party committee went deep into the rubber factory, he found that some cadres and workers in the factory began to develop a complacent mood of "production is almost done." He carried out ideological education of continuous revolution to them and discussed with the cadres of the factory whether production had reached its peak. After a comprehensive analysis of the situation, they realized that the factory's equipment had not been fully utilized, and there were also inappropriate aspects of the labor organization. After improvements were made in these two aspects, the factory jumped from a daily output of 400 meters of universal tape to more than 1,000 meters. The main products produced by the whole factory in mid-May and late May, such as universal tape and recycled rubber soles, all overfulfilled the production plan. The total output value in May increased more than three times compared with April. The blowing equipment of the commune-run glass instrument factory had small wind power and weak firepower, and the glass melting time was very long, resulting in low production efficiency. The employees of this factory had long wanted to modify the blowing equipment, but they were afraid of not doing it well, and hesitated to take action. After the commune cadres went down to understand the situation, they immediately encouraged them to actively carry out the modification, and introduced them to several practical methods. The factory employees fought one night to modify the blowing equipment, increasing the firepower by 30% and correspondingly increasing the production efficiency by 30%.

    The main cadres of the commune are assigned to specific areas to grasp production, grasp planning, and grasp measures, which makes the relationship between factories within the commune closer and more conducive to cooperation and exchange of new experiences and new technologies, and fully utilizes the superiority of the commune's "large and public" nature. For example, the commune Party committee transferred a group of technicians from old factories with good foundations and relatively strong technical forces to form a special technical team for "tackling key problems." Under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, they focused on helping commune-run factories break through some key technical innovation projects, so that the production and "four modernizations" movement of commune-run industry could fully leap forward. The atmosphere of mutual cooperation among the factories has also been greatly developed. If a factory has difficulties in production or technology, all the more than 100 factories in the commune will actively come to support it. In early May, the production line of the commune-run refractory material factory broke down and needed screws for repair. The commune-run hardware miscellaneous parts factory and screw factory immediately processed screws for them, so that they quickly repaired the production line and put it into production.

    广州大新公社领导干部深入第一线
    抓生产　抓计划　抓措施　促使社办工业生产大跃进
    本报讯　广州大新人民公社的主要领导干部深入生产第一线领导生产，解决了社办工业中的许多关键问题，促进了工业的生产。5月份社办工业总产值为建社前4月份的348％，超过建社前这个地区街道工业今年第一季度总产值的22％。
    大新人民公社党委为了迅速提高社办工业的水平和开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，决定领导干部要深入生产现场，亲自抓生产、抓计划、抓措施。他们把社办工业按地区、按行业划分为五个片，由公社的主要领导干部分工包干领导，以保证公社党委的计划、措施能准确而及时地贯彻到底。
    许多社办工厂，在公社领导干部深入领导生产后，都迅速针对厂里的薄弱环节和关键问题，突破一些对生产起决定作用的技术革新项目。社办灯丝厂的职工，在公社领导干部深入到厂传达公社党委关于开展“四化”运动的部署后，立即针对厂里用手工磨线眼的落后环节，组织力量奋战两天，仿制出一部电动磨线眼机，工效提高十一倍，解决了这个厂生产中的关键问题。这个厂5月份的生产就比4月份增长了二倍多。
    公社领导干部深入生产现场以后，对群众的思想动态、生产中存在的问题都了如指掌，因而能够切切实实地帮助群众解决一些妨碍生产跃进的思想问题，以及生产中的一些实际问题。公社的党委书记深入到橡胶厂以后，发现这个厂有些干部和工人开始滋长“生产差不多”的自满情绪，便向他们进行不断革命的思想教育，并且和厂里的干部讨论生产是否已经到顶。经过全面分析情况，他们发觉厂里的设备还没有充分利用起来，劳动组织也有不妥善的地方。在这两方面加以改进以后，这个厂就从日产万能带四百米跃进到一千多米。全厂5月中、下旬生产的主要产品万能带、再生胶鞋底等，都超额完成了生产计划，5月份总产值比4月份增长三倍多。社办玻璃仪器厂的鼓风设备风力小、火力弱，玻璃熔化的时间拖得很长，生产效率不高。这个厂的职工早就想改装鼓风设备，但又怕搞不好，犹豫不敢动手，公社干部下去了解到这些情况后，立即鼓励他们积极进行改装，并且向他们介绍了几种切实可行的办法。工厂职工奋战一个晚上就把鼓风设备改装好，使火力增大30％，生产效率也相应地提高30％。
    公社的主要干部分片包干抓生产、抓计划、抓措施，使社内厂与厂之间的关系更加密切，更有利于进行协作和交流新经验、新技术，充分发挥公社一大二公的优越性。例如公社党委从基础好、技术力量比较雄厚的老厂中抽调了一批技术人员，组成一支专门“攻关”的技术队伍，在公社党委的统一领导下，有重点地帮助社办工厂突破一些关键性的技术革新项目，使社办工业的生产和“四化”运动能够全面跃进。各个工厂互相协作的风气也大为发挥，一个厂在生产上或技术上有困难，全社一百多个工厂都主动来支援。5月初，社办耐火材料厂的生产自动线坏了，需要用螺丝修理，社办五金杂件厂和螺丝厂便立即替他们加工螺丝，使他们迅速修好自动线投入生产。
