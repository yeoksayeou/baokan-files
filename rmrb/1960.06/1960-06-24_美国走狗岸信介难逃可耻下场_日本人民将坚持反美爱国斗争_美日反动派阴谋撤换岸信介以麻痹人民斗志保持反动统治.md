Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: This reporter's commentary: The U.S. imperialism's agent, Nobusuke Kishi, was finally forced to announce his "determination to resign" today under the resolute struggle of the Japanese people. Kishi's downfall is a direct result of the Japanese people's vigorous anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle over the past year. From April 15, 1959, the Japanese people launched a nationwide unified action against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and by June 19 this year, they had conducted eighteen such actions. The number of participants neared 90 million, a figure equivalent to Japan's total population. In this rising tide of unified action, slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet," "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," and "Yankees Go Home" became increasingly loud, and have become a program of action uniting all anti-American patriotic forces into a united front. In particular, through the nationwide demonstrations against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the nationwide protests against the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of demonstrations in the "June 15th" tragedy, and the four general strikes of "June 4th," "June 15th," "June 18th," and "June 22nd," the struggle goals of the Japanese workers, farmers, students, educators, cultural, art, and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors have focused on their two main enemies—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. This has rapidly increased the Japanese people's political consciousness, led to new developments in the patriotic democratic united front, and created a surging anti-American and anti-Kishi wave, making it difficult for Kishi Nobusuke to maintain his position. U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capitalist group could not help but see that allowing Kishi Nobusuke to continue to linger on would only make the situation more unfavorable to them.

Kishi's downfall is also the inevitable result of his doing all kinds of bad things. Since Nobusuke Kishi formed his cabinet in the spring of 1957, he has actively implemented a policy of submitting to the United States, being hostile to China, and stepping up the restoration of Japanese militarism and fascist rule. In the summer of 1957, shortly after taking office, Kishi Nobusuke even visited the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and openly stated that Chiang Kai-shek's "counterattack against the mainland" was very good. Subsequently, Kishi Nobusuke followed the United States in creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy. In the spring of 1958, Kishi Nobusuke became even more reckless, openly condoning thugs in Nagasaki to insult the Chinese flag, and single-handedly sabotaging the Sino-Japanese trade relations and various exchanges that had been established over the years through the joint efforts of the Chinese government and the people of China and Japan. After 1959, Kishi Nobusuke's imperialist nature became even more rampant, brazenly colluding with U.S. imperialism to conclude a military alliance treaty hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia. Not long ago, in order to "ratify" this military alliance treaty and suppress the anti-American movement, Kishi Nobusuke even created the "June 15th" tragedy, which aroused the anger of the people throughout the country. Today, Kishi Nobusuke once again disregards the great disapproval of the world and imposes the farce of the so-called final approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the Japanese people. These actions of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, which violated the will of the Japanese people, were hostile to China, and threatened peace in Asia, have been digging a grave for itself from the very beginning.

The fact that in just over two months, the United States's lackeys in Asia, Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Nobusuke Kishi, have been successively overthrown proves a truth: any political group and traitor who relies on U.S. imperialism and sells out national interests will be abandoned and overthrown by the people.

Of course, behind Kishi Nobusuke's announcement of his resignation lies a conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. They are attempting to divert the Japanese people's struggle goals, paralyze the people's fighting spirit, and stabilize their rule by letting Kishi Nobusuke "complete" the dirty procedures of "ratifying" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." After "cleaning up the situation" in this way, they will implement all the plans contained in the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that endanger peace and security in Asia and the interests of the Japanese nation. What the Japanese people oppose is not just Kishi Nobusuke personally, but the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, Kishi Nobusuke's treasonous policies, and U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies. As long as this treaty exists and these policies are not crushed, the Japanese people will not be deceived by Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and will not relax their struggle. On the contrary, they will continue to carry out a patriotic and just struggle on the basis of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

### 美国走狗岸信介难逃可耻下场  日本人民将坚持反美爱国斗争  美日反动派阴谋撤换岸信介以麻痹人民斗志保持反动统治

    美国走狗岸信介难逃可耻下场
    日本人民将坚持反美爱国斗争
    美日反动派阴谋撤换岸信介以麻痹人民斗志保持反动统治
    新华社23日讯　本社记者述评：美帝国主义的代理人岸信介今天终于在日本人民的坚决斗争下被迫宣布“决心辞职”。岸信介的垮台，是日本人民一年多来有力地展开反美反岸爱国斗争的直接结果。日本人民从1959年4月15日展开的反对日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动，到今年6月19日已经进行了十八次，参加统一行动的人数近九千万人次，这个数字相当于日本的人口总数。在这一浪高一浪的统一行动中，“打倒岸信介内阁”、“粉碎日美安全条约”和“美国佬滚出去”等口号，越来越响亮，已经成为团结一切反美爱国力量结成统一战线的行动纲领。特别是通过反对艾森豪威尔访日的全民性大示威、反对岸信介政府镇压示威的“六·一五”惨案的全民性大抗议和“六·四”、“六·一五”、“六·一八”、“六·二二”四次总罢工，日本工人、农民、学生、教育、文化、艺术、中小企业等各阶层人民的斗争目标，集中地指向他们的两个主要敌人——美帝国主义和岸信介内阁，使日本人民的政治觉悟迅速提高，爱国民主统一战线有了新的发展，反美反岸浪潮汹涌澎湃，使岸信介难于再站住脚。美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团不能不看到，再要岸信介苟延残喘下去，形势的发展将更加对他们不利。
    岸信介下台也是他作尽了坏事的必然结果。自从1957年春季岸信介成立内阁以来，他就积极执行屈从美国、敌视中国和加紧恢复日本军国主义和法西斯统治的政策。岸信介在他上台后不久的1957年夏季，竟访问台湾蒋介石集团，并且公然发表谈话说蒋介石“反攻大陆”非常之好；随后，岸信介又追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。到了1958年春，岸信介更加变本加厉，公然纵容暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗，并且一手破坏了几年来在中国政府和中日两国人民共同努力下建立起来的日中贸易关系和各种往来。进入1959年以后，岸信介的帝国主义本质表现得更为猖狂，悍然勾结美帝国主义缔结以中苏和亚洲人民为敌的军事同盟条约。不久前，岸信介为了“批准”这项军事同盟条约和镇压反美运动，竟制造了激起全国人民愤怒的“六·一五”惨案。今天，岸信介又冒天下之大不韪，把所谓最后批准新日美“安全条约”的丑剧强加在日本人民头上。岸信介内阁的这些违反日本人民意志、敌视中国和威胁亚洲和平的行为，从一开始就在为它自己挖掘了坟墓。
    在两个多月里，美国在亚洲的奴仆李承晚、曼德列斯和岸信介相继被赶下台这个事实本身，说明了一个真理：凡是投靠美帝国主义、出卖民族利益的政治集团和卖国贼，必将为人民所唾弃，所打倒。
    当然，在岸信介宣布下台的后面，也隐藏着美日反动派的阴谋。它们企图在使岸信介“完成”了“批准”新日美“安全条约”的肮脏手续后，用让岸信介下台来转移日本人民的斗争目标，麻痹人民的斗志，稳定它们的统治地位，在这样“收拾时局”之后，推行日美军事同盟条约所包含的危害亚洲和平安全和日本民族利益的全部策划。日本人民反对的不只是岸信介个人，他们要打倒的是日美军事同盟条约，是岸信介奉行的卖国政策和美帝国主义的侵略政策。只要这种条约存在，这种政策没有被粉碎，日本人民是不会被岸信介下台这种手法所欺骗和放松斗争的。相反，他们将在打倒了岸信介内阁的基础上，继续展开爱国正义斗争。
