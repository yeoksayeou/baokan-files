    On the Front Lines of the Summer Harvest
    Liu Wenhe, First Secretary of the Shuangmiao People's Commune Committee, Jiahe County, Hebei Province

    June 1st
    As the east just began to lighten, I set off, passed the road, and went through the golden wheat sea, arriving at the North Bali Production Team.
    Wow! The wheat fields were already bustling. Men, women, young and old, all beaming with joy, were busy harvesting wheat. I happily joined their ranks, chatting while cutting, and discussing production.
    During the break, I asked them about the harvesting and threshing situation. Branch Secretary Sun Shuling said, "We have a total of 820 mu of wheat, and we've already harvested more than 220 mu." I asked, "How much have you threshed?" He said, "We're worried about that! With only about 110 laborers, we can't handle both the harvest and the threshing. We're planning to thresh it all at once after the harvest." I said:
  "The wheat stacks are piled up like small hills. If there's wind and rain, the loss would be unimaginable!" But if we take laborers to thresh wheat, it will affect the harvesting progress. What should we do? While cutting wheat, I discussed the matter of "combining harvesting and threshing" with the veteran farmers. Commune members like Wang Qingrui suggested that noon is a good time to thresh wheat. Spreading the wheat, starting the threshing ground, and turning the wheat all require a lot of people. If the commune members all go to the threshing ground to rest at noon, they can participate in spreading and turning the wheat during their break, so that they can rest and thresh at the same time. The commune members all agreed to this method, and it was implemented that noon. This method is very good. When spreading, turning, and starting the ground, over one hundred laborers work together. When using the mill, people go to rest. In one noon, seven threshing grounds were completed, and more than 180 mu of wheat were threshed, achieving simultaneous harvesting and threshing.

        June 2nd
    In the morning, I cut wheat with the commune members of the Yanzhuang Production Team. I used all my strength and worked hard, but I still couldn't keep up with the commune members. Branch Secretary Pang Liansheng said, "Cutting wheat is a technical job. It's not enough to just have brute force; you also need skill!" I thought to myself: More than 20 production teams in the south used to mostly pull wheat, and they don't have the habit of cutting. If they are not skilled in cutting wheat, they will definitely not cut quickly. So, I learned techniques from the commune members while cutting. The commune members told me: "Grasp a large handful, stand firm, pull the sickle quickly, and you'll get the job done." They also gave me a technical demonstration.
    At noon, when I contacted the office on the phone, the comrades in the office also said: The commune members in the northern half of the production teams cut four or five mu per person per day, while the commune members in the southern half of the production teams cut only a little more than one mu per person per day. In the afternoon, a field meeting was held in Yanzhuang, allowing the 24 small team leaders in the southern half to learn the experience of cutting wheat.

        June 3rd
    Early in the morning, I came to the Shuangmiao Production Team. The commune members were full of energy, but the order was chaotic. The cut wheat could not be bundled, and the bundled wheat could not be transported home. From the commune members' reflections, I learned that the main reason was that the competition among the various specialized teams was not well organized, and the task requirements were not clear. I used the break time to discuss with Branch Secretary Wang Jishun and Team Leader Su Shizhen. They also felt that this was a problem. So, the cadres went to the commune members separately to discuss and mobilize everyone to offer suggestions. Finally, according to the commune members' opinions, it was decided that the four specialized teams of harvesting, bundling, transporting, and threshing would implement a one-stop grand competition. Each team and each person would have a competition, and each process would have a competition. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for labor, and that afternoon the average wheat harvest per person increased from one mu to two and a half mu.

        June 4th
    This year, I came to the Nanbali Production Team with the comrades in the office. During the wheat cutting process, I saw that the commune members were doing a relatively rough job in harvesting and transporting. Some commune members said: "It's inevitable to lose a few grains. Who doesn't drop a grain of rice when eating?" This idea that "loss is unavoidable" and "a few grains don't matter" is the root cause of the rough harvesting and threshing.
    At that time, I worked with two commune members to create a careful harvesting "experimental field." In an area three square meters wide, we picked up twenty-six ears of wheat, not including the dropped grains. I did some calculations with the commune members: This team has a total of 1,100 mu of wheat this year. If each mu averages 400,000 ears, and one grain is dropped per ear, then there are more than 400,000 grains per mu, which is more than 26 jin. In total, we will lose more than 28,600 jin of wheat. For the entire team of 820 people, each person accounts for 34 jin of wheat. Once this calculation was done, it attracted the attention of the commune members.
    In the evening, I told the office on the phone about the situation of careful harvesting and threshing in the Nanbali Team. The office immediately called the management areas and production teams, and mobilized the team cadres to universally educate the commune members on calculating "the balance sheet."

        June 5th
    In the evening, I came to the Fuzhuang Production Team. In the team office, I read the June 4th "Hebei Daily" editorial "Plant Sufficient Late Autumn Crops." The editorial emphasized the issue of planting as soon as we harvest, and striving for the late autumn to catch up with the early autumn. I planned to first understand the masses' thoughts on this issue.
    After dinner, I went to the threshing ground and talked to the commune members about the summer planting. A commune member in his fifties said: "The old rule is to sun the wheat stubble for forty days. Summer planting is still early!" Several commune members raised objections: "The earlier the late crops are planted, the better, because the season doesn't wait for people. Planting one day earlier, matures ten days earlier!" The commune members talked to each other, one sentence after another. It seemed like casual chatting, but it was actually a small debate. After understanding the underlying thoughts, there was confidence in guiding the work.
    The men and women commune members in the commune were everywhere discussing the issue of planting as soon as we harvest, and striving for the late autumn to catch up with the early autumn. Conservative thinking and habitual forces were criticized. With clear thinking, there were ways to solve the problem. The team scientifically planned the labor force and animal power according to the commune members' opinions, and adopted a combination of threshing and plowing. After unloading the plow, they threshed; after unloading the axle, they plowed. Planting and cultivating with the harvest was launched.

    在夏收第一线上
    中共河北交河县双庙公社委员会第一书记　刘文和
    六月一日
    东方刚刚发白，我就出发，走过公路，穿过金黄色的麦海，便到了北八里生产队。
    吓！麦田里早已沸腾起来，男女老少，喜气洋洋，正在忙着收割麦子。我高高兴兴地参加了他们的行列，一边割麦，一边拉家常，一边谈生产。
    休息的时候，我问了问他们收打麦子的情况。支部书记孙树岭同志说：“俺们一共八百二十亩小麦，已经收割了二百二十多亩。”我问：“你们打轧了多少啦？” 他说：“俺们正为这事发愁呢！一共百十个劳动力，顾了吹笛，顾不了捏眼，打算收完了再一块儿打轧。”我说：
  “麦垛堆得像一个个小山，一旦遇上个风雨，那损失就不可设想啊！”抽出劳力打轧麦子，就要影响收割进度，怎么办呢？在割麦中，我和老农们谈起了“收打结合”的事情来。老社员王庆瑞等提出，晌午是打轧麦子的好时候，摊场、起场、翻场又需要人多，如果晌午社员们都到场里去休息，利用休息时间参加摊场、翻场，可以做到休息、打场两不误。社员们都同意这个办法，当天晌午就实行了。这个办法很好，摊场、翻场、起场时，百十个劳动力一齐动手；套轴轧的时候，人们便去休息，一晌午打了七场，轧了一百八十多亩地的麦子，做到了随收随打。
        六月二日
    上午，我和颜庄生产队的社员们一起割麦子，用尽全身力气紧忙干活，还是跟不上社员们。支部书记庞连升说：“割麦子是个技术活，光有猛劲不行，还得有巧劲！”我心想：南部有二十多个生产队过去多是拔麦子，没有割的习惯。割麦技术不熟练，必然割不快。我就一边割，一边向社员们学习技术。社员们告诉我：“抓大把，脚站稳，快拉镰，就出活。”还给我做了技术表演。
    晌午，我从电话上跟办公室联系时，办公室的同志也说：北半部生产队的社员每人一天割四、五亩，南半部生产队的社员每人一天只割一亩多。下午在颜庄开了现场会，让南半部二十四个小队长在这里学习了割麦经验。
        六月三日
    起早，我来到双庙生产队。社员们干劲足，只是秩序乱。割了捆不起来，捆了又运不到家来。从社员们的反映中我了解到主要原因是各专业队的竞赛没搞好，任务要求不明确。我利用休息时间，和支部书记王继顺、队长苏世贞进行了研究，他们也认为这是一个问题。于是干部就分头找社员去商量，发动大家献计献策。最后根据社员们的意见，确定收割、捆拾、拉麦、轧场四个专业队实行一条龙大竞赛，各队各人有竞赛，各个工序有竞赛。这样大大发挥了群众的劳动积极性，当天下午平均一人收麦由一亩增加到二亩半。
        六月四日
    今年，我同办公室的同志来到了南八里生产队。在割麦过程中，我见到社员们收割、拉运做得比较粗糙。有的社员说：“丢一星半点的怎么也免不了。谁家吃饭不掉个饭粒。”这种“丢失是不可避免的”、“星星点点不算什么”的思想，正是造成收打粗糙的根子。
    当时，我就和两个社员搞了一块细收“试验田”，三平方米宽的面积就拾了二十六个麦穗，丢掉的麦粒不在内。我和社员们算了一笔账：这个队今年共有一千一百亩小麦，每亩平均按四十万个穗计算，一穗掉一粒，一亩就是四十多万粒，合二十六斤多，总共就要丢二万八千六百多斤小麦，全队八百二十口人，每人合三十四斤麦子。这么一算账，引起了社员们的注意。
    晚上，我在电话上把南八里队细收细打的情况告诉了办公室。办公室立刻给各管理区、生产队打了电话，发动队干部普遍向社员进行算“一笔账”的教育。
        六月五日
    晚上，来到付庄生产队。在队办公室里读了6月4日河北日报
  “种足种好晚秋作物”的社论。社论中强调指出了随收随种，力争晚秋赶早秋的问题。我打算先摸一摸群众在这个问题上的思想情况。
    晚饭后，我到场里和社员们拉起夏种的事情。一位五十多岁的社员说：“老规矩是晒四十天的麦茬，夏种早着哩！”几个社员提出了反对意见：“晚庄稼种得越早越好，因为季节不让人，早种一天，早熟十天！”社员们在一起你一言，他一句，看来是闲聊天，实际上是小辩论。摸到了思想的底，指导工作也就有了把握。
    社里的男男女女社员到处都谈论随收随种、晚秋赶早秋的问题，保守思想、习惯势力受到了批判。思想通了就有办法，队上根据社员的意见，对劳力、畜力进行了科学规划，采取打场、耕地两结合，卸了犁打场，卸了轴耕地。随收随耕、随种就这样搞起来了。
