Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 21st: The Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party continued on the morning of the 21st.

The morning session on the 21st first heard the work report of the Central Inspection Commission, delivered by Du Cristescu, a member of the Workers' Party Central Inspection Commission. The reporter said that the Party's expenditure on training cadres in 1959 was 81% more than in 1955. Currently, 900 Party members are studying at advanced Party schools. 190,000 Party committee members and propaganda personnel nationwide have studied in training courses organized by municipal and county Party committees. Party organizations at all levels have taken the letters from the masses seriously, and the Party's connection with the masses has become closer.

The meeting then began to discuss Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's report and the report of the Central Inspection Commission.

Chivu Stoica, member of the Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke at the meeting. He said that a new material and economic foundation has been established in Romania, productivity has greatly developed, and people's living standards have been continuously improved. This proves the superiority of socialism. Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Party's leadership role over the state and the economy has been strengthened, and the Party's ability to solve complex problems in economic construction has been strengthened. The correctness of the general line is the decisive factor for victory. The above facts prove the importance of ensuring the Party's leadership role during the transition from capitalism to socialism. He also talked about the importance of expanding socialist democracy and absorbing the masses to participate in national leadership. He pointed out that the powers of local people's congresses have been expanded. Now, there are 130,000 deputies in the people's congresses at all levels in Romania, including 70,000 deputies from minority nationalities and 37,000 female deputies.

Chivu Stoica said that in order to strengthen the Party's leadership role, the ministers of various ministries and the heads of competent departments should maintain close contact with the Party organizations and jointly formulate work plans. He also requested that the relevant departments of the central government pay attention to improving cooperation with the local people's congresses, help develop local industries, and make full use of local resources.

Gheorghe Rosu, the First Secretary of the Bacău County Party Committee, spoke first. He described how the county had transformed from an economically backward area into an important industrial area. He said that life proves that the focus of the Party's work is the work of people.

Nicolae Gheorghiu, Deputy Minister of Heavy Industry of Romania, then spoke. He talked about the situation of giving priority to the development of heavy industry in Romania and the successful completion of the ten-year electrification plan. He said that the electricity output stipulated in the 1960-1965 National Economic Development Plan and the long-term economic development plan will guarantee the electricity needed by industry, agriculture, major railways, and all cities and villages.

Vasile Dănălacu, member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and First Secretary of the Bucharest Municipal Party Committee, said at the meeting that achievements in all aspects prove that the Party's Leninist line is correct. The capital, Bucharest, produces 20% of the country's industrial products. The total industrial output value in 1960 will increase by 64% compared with 1955.

Alexandru Tripșa, the representative of the Party organization of the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory, which has won the Red Banner of Production Excellence eighteen times, said at the meeting that the workers of this factory have never flinched in the face of difficulties. Currently, one in four people is a production innovator. This factory will produce 24,000 tractors in 1964, thereby completing the 1965 task one year ahead of schedule.

The next speaker was Gheorghe Nicolae, First Secretary of the Bucharest Regional Party Committee. He said that 99% of farmers in this region have now joined agricultural cooperative organizations. Rural Party organizations have been strengthened, and the Party's ties with the masses have also been strengthened. Gheorghe Nicolae said that one of the measures to increase production is to apply natural fertilizers, which will be used in large quantities in the future. The irrigated area will be greatly increased in the next few years. In 1965, the yield of wheat per hectare will increase to 2,000 kilograms. He said that the region will vigorously develop animal husbandry in the future.

Constantin Dinculescu, Dean of the Bucharest Institute of Technology, said at the meeting that the current main task is to combine teaching with production and cultivate cadres with modern technical knowledge. The problem of combining teaching with production has not been completely solved and will continue to seek new ways of combining them. Representatives from Dolj County, Mihai, and the First Secretary of the Pitești County Party Committee, Ștefan Matei, also spoke at the morning meeting.

The morning meeting on the 21st ended here, and the meeting continued at 4 pm (local time) in the afternoon.
