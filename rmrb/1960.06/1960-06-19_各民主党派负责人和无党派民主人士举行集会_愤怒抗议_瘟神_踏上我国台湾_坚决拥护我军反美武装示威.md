Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Leaders of China's democratic parties and non-party democrats today, with the strongest voices, angrily protested the Far East gangster trip of Eisenhower, the chieftain of U.S. imperialism, and angrily protested this mortal enemy of the Chinese people stepping on our sacred territory of Taiwan. They stated that all the Chinese people resolutely support the powerful armed demonstration of our heroic People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front shelling this war "plague god."

Eisenhower, amidst the earth-shattering demonstration artillery fire of our army, today climbed onto the coast of our territory Taiwan. Leaders of China's democratic parties and non-party democrats held a meeting this afternoon, expressing their strongest protest and angry condemnation of Eisenhower's Far East trip.

Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said at the meeting that Eisenhower's Far East gangster trip, "more clearly exposes that U.S. imperialism is the pillar of all the most reactionary and corrupt forces in Asia, the greatest threat to peace in Asia, and the common mortal enemy of the Asian people."

Zhang Zhizhong expressed his firm support for our heroic People's Liberation Army using artillery to drive away the "plague god." He revealed that U.S. imperialism is attempting to annex our sacred territory of Taiwan, plotting to create "two Chinas," and recently is also instigating "Taiwan autonomy," creating "opposition parties." He warned, what are the intentions of all these U.S. imperialist plots? It should arouse the high vigilance of all patriotic military and government personnel in Taiwan. Zhang Zhizhong called on the military and government personnel in Taiwan to "recognize the future, inspire righteousness, unite together, and carry out continuous and resolute struggle against the American aggressors"!

Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said that Eisenhower's Far East trip is a criminal activity to plot new wars of aggression, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and be hostile to the people of Asian countries. It has aroused a tide of resistance from the people of various countries everywhere. The sound of ten thousand cannons roaring in unison in our motherland is a head-on blow to the U.S. imperialist chieftain of aggression, a boost to the morale of the Taiwan compatriots who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, and a contempt and disdain for U.S. imperialism. Our Democratic League resolutely supports the armed demonstration of our People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front against U.S. imperialism. We, along with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the American occupation of Taiwan! We are determined to drive U.S. imperialism out!

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech that Eisenhower arrived in Asia and our territory of Taiwan amidst worldwide condemnation, to which we express our greatest protest. He said that the arrival of this "plague god" is another serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people, a complete exposure of the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan.

Huang Yanpei said that in the face of the serious provocation of U.S. imperialism, we must "strike back at those who strike us." The cannon fire that shook the mountains and rivers in the Taiwan Strait expressed the extreme anger and protest of the Chinese people. He solemnly warned that the great Chinese people are not to be insulted. If U.S. imperialism does not stop its provocative activities against the Chinese people, and does not get out of Taiwan, it will bear all the serious consequences, and blood debts must be repaid with blood.

Zhang Xiruo, a non-party democrat, said that Eisenhower's class mission in coming to the Far East for a "visit" is to further implement the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in Asia, engage in the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and support Kishi Nobusuke. He said with extreme contempt that Eisenhower's visit this time is very good. If he hadn't come, he might not have aroused such a stronger anti-American wave of anger among the Asian people. Now that he has been given the "cold shoulder" by the Japanese people and received a "welcome" from our people's artillery, it has made the people of the world see more clearly how imperialism is rotting away day by day, and see clearly that U.S. imperialism is a veritable "paper tiger." Zhang Xiruo said that the "salute" we gave to Eisenhower represents the Chinese people's contempt and disdain for the U.S. imperialist chieftain, and demonstrates the fearless spirit of our people. This is a powerful armed demonstration. This "salute" is a great support and encouragement to the people in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism.

Chen Shutong said at the meeting that our people across the country express unparalleled indignation at the "visit to Taiwan" conspiracy of the butcher Eisenhower. The Chinese people will never allow U.S. imperialism to occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan for a long time, and the Taiwan compatriots will never tolerate the long-term brutal trampling by the U.S. imperialists. The heroic Taiwan compatriots will surely be able to smash the shackles of the U.S. imperialists and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that Eisenhower, despite the strong opposition of the Asian people, insisted on coming to the Far East to plot new war conspiracies, but under the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, he finally had to be forced to announce the "postponement" of his trip to Japan, which once again exposed the true form of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger. He said that Eisenhower is a plague god, and artillery should be used to deal with the plague god. U.S. imperialism is an enemy of the Chinese people everywhere. Our powerful Chinese people have given U.S. imperialism many lessons in the past, and will give it even greater lessons in the future. We must liberate Taiwan and drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan.

Guo Zecheng, member of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that when the puppets of U.S. imperialism in Japan, South Korea, Turkey, etc., have either been overthrown or are on the verge of collapse, Eisenhower had to brave the risks and personally go to Asia to cheer up his running dogs and prop them up, attempting to suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the people of various Asian countries. He said that all this has aroused strong opposition from the people of various Asian countries. We solemnly warn Eisenhower: Powerful socialist China has enough power to crush any aggression. Every time you provoke us, you will definitely receive a double retaliation. Finally, he shouted: "Plague god Eisenhower, get out!"

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said that on the tenth anniversary of U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan, Eisenhower came to Taiwan again to further create conspiracies and intensify military provocations against our country, which aroused the unstoppable anger of all the Chinese people.

He said that our army's shelling of the "plague god" on the Fujian front fully expressed the strong will of the entire Chinese people to support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries and the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's gangster trip, and expressed the firm confidence of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. He asserted that Eisenhower has already tasted the lessons of the Asian people, and greater and heavier lessons are waiting for him.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan is a serious provocation to the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, and also a serious threat to the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. This executioner, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is on this gangster trip entirely to prepare and arrange new wars of aggression. There can be no peace without smashing the U.S. imperialist conspiracies and without overthrowing U.S. imperialism. The powerful artillery fire in the Taiwan Strait expresses the righteous roar of the 650 million Chinese people.

Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that it will be the tenth anniversary in a few days since U.S. imperialism openly armed occupied Taiwan on June 27, 1950. For ten years, the American aggressors have barbarously plundered and devastated the Taiwan compatriots, turning our beautiful and prosperous island of Taiwan into a hell on earth, committing heinous crimes against the Taiwan compatriots. Today, Eisenhower, the number one enemy of the people of the world and a war monger, came to our Taiwan for a so-called "visit," attempting to continue to promote the aggressive policy of creating "two Chinas," permanently occupying Taiwan, and resolutely being an enemy of our people, and is frantically preparing for war in the Taiwan Strait, intensifying the tense situation in the Far East. This is a serious provocation to the Chinese people, and we express our strong protest.

Xu Mengshan said, we warn the American aggressors that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the United States is never allowed to create "two Chinas," and its conspiracy to permanently occupy Taiwan is never allowed to be realized. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the American troops must get out of the Taiwan region.

Shao Lizi, Central Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that Eisenhower came to the Far East for a "visit" this time with a stiff upper lip, and his heart was filled with fear. In addition to encountering resistance from the people, Eisenhower will also encounter another force of resistance in Taiwan. Shao Lizi emphasized that can the military and government personnel in Taiwan, or even Chiang Kai-shek himself, agree to the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas"?

Zhang Shizhao, a non-party democrat, said that U.S. imperialism has long attempted to force Chiang Kai-shek to exchange Kinmen and Matsu for the conspiracy of "two Chinas," which the Chinese people resolutely oppose. Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu can never be separated, and we Chinese people have enough power to bring Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu back to the embrace of the motherland together.

Deng Chumin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in his speech that we Chinese people express our most serious protest and condemnation of the head of U.S. imperialism, the murderous criminal, and the bloody executioner Eisenhower, for daring to come to Taiwan to plot war conspiracies and hostile banditry against our country. He said that historical experience has proven that any reactionaries and anyone who launches wars of aggression will eventually cause their own death. Eisenhower's gangster trip is exactly a trip to death. Deng Chumin finally shouted passionately: "American aggressors, get out of Taiwan, open fire!"

Wang Yunsheng, a non-party democrat, said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan are not isolated. They have the support of 650 million heroic compatriots of the powerful motherland. The booming artillery fire from our Fujian front loudly told the U.S. imperialist bandit chief Eisenhower that U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan! If it wants to stay and赖着not leave, its ending will not be better than the fate of the Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, and other colonialist bandits who were driven away by the Taiwan people in the past. Wang Yunsheng shouted angrily: "Get out! American bandits!"

Qian Changzhao, a Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said indignantly that the war monger Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan further exposed the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and adhere to the aggressive policy of being an enemy of the Chinese people. His trip to Taiwan aroused unparalleled anger among the Chinese people. The just voice of the cannons of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front bombing the "plague god" resounded through the clouds, and the awakened Asian people fully understand how to teach this number one war monger a lesson.

Chen Wenbin, a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that the angered Asian people have already used or are preparing to use appropriate ways to "welcome" and "send off" Eisenhower, this "plague god." The Philippine people used stones, the Japanese people used a "cold shoulder," and we Chinese people used artillery to deliver "welcome speeches" and "farewell speeches." The Korean people, who have driven away Eisenhower's "great man" Syngman Rhee, will also express something. We Taiwan compatriots also know how to "receive" this plague god. I firmly believe that the Taiwan compatriots will cooperate with the artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front to give this "plague god" the "reception" he deserves.

Su Ziheng, a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that as a Taiwanese, I firmly oppose Eisenhower's conspiratorial activities during this trip to Taiwan. Eisenhower is playing new tricks, conspiring to create the so-called "Taiwan of the Taiwanese," inciting the Taiwan people to secede from the motherland, and trying his best to encourage a small group of pro-American "Taiwan independence elements" to "petition" when Eisenhower arrives in Taiwan, requesting American "aid." U.S. imperialism attempts to achieve the goal of realizing "isolating Taiwan" and "trusteeship of Taiwan" by this despicable means. But the U.S. imperialist conspiracies cannot succeed. The military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu should unite and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to the end against turning Taiwan into a springboard for launching wars of aggression.

Also attending the symposium were He Xiangning and Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shi Liang and Hu Yuzhi, Vice Chairmen of the China Democratic League, Hu Zi'ang, Deputy Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Xu Guangping and Yang Dongchun, Vice Chairmen of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Xia Kangnong and Wang Renxuan, members of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhou Peiyuan and Yan Jici, Vice Chairmen of the Jiusan Society, Zhu Kezhen, a non-party democrat, and more than 120 central standing committee members and central committee members of various democratic parties.

    各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士举行集会
    愤怒抗议“瘟神”踏上我国台湾  坚决拥护我军反美武装示威
    新华社18日讯　我国各民主党派和无党派民主人士的负责人，今天以最强烈的呼声愤怒抗议美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的远东强盗旅行，愤怒抗议这个中国人民的死敌踏上我国神圣的领土台湾。他们表示，全体中国人民坚决拥护我福建前线英勇的人民解放军炮轰这个战争“瘟神”的强大武装示威。
    艾森豪威尔在我军震天动地的示威炮火声中，今天爬上了我国领土台湾的海岸。我国各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士在下午举行集会，对艾森豪威尔的远东之行表示了最强烈的抗议和愤怒的谴责。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中在会上说，艾森豪威尔这个侵略头子的远东强盗旅行，“更加清楚地暴露了美帝国主义是亚洲一切最反动最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲和平的最大威胁，是亚洲人民共同的死敌”。
    张治中表示坚决拥护我英勇的人民解放军用大炮驱逐“瘟神”。他揭露说，美帝国主义妄想吞并我国神圣领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”，最近又在策动“台湾自治”，制造“反对派”。他警告说，美帝国主义的这一切阴谋活动用心何在？应该引起一切有爱国心的在台湾的军政人员的高度警惕。张治中呼吁在台湾的军政人员，“认清前途，激发大义，一致团结起来，同美国侵略者进行不断的坚决的斗争”！
    中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩说，艾森豪威尔的远东之行，是来策划新的侵略战争，干涉亚洲各国内政，与亚洲各国人民为敌的罪恶活动，他到处激起了各国人民反抗的怒潮。我们祖国大陆上的万炮齐鸣，是给美帝国主义侵略头子的当头一棒，是给正在和美帝国主义展开斗争的台湾同胞壮大声势，是对美帝国主义的蔑视和鄙视。我们民主同盟坚决支持福建前线我人民解放军对美帝国主义的武装示威，我们和全国人民一道坚决反对美国侵占台湾！坚决要把美帝国主义赶出去！
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培在发言中说，艾森豪威尔在举世唾骂声中到了亚洲，到了我国的领土台湾，对此我们表示极大的抗议。他说，这个“瘟神”的来到，是美帝国主义对中国人民的又一次严重挑衅，是制造“两个中国”，妄图永久霸占台湾的阴谋的彻底暴露。
    黄炎培说，对美帝国主义的严重挑衅，我们一定要“予打击者以打击”。台湾海峡震动山河的炮声，表示了中国人民极度的愤怒和抗议。他严正地警告说，伟大的中国人民是不可侮的。美帝国主义如果再不停止它对中国人民的挑衅活动，如果不从台湾滚出去，一切严重的后果都将由它承担，血债是要用血来偿还的。
    无党派民主人士张奚若说，艾森豪威尔来远东“访问”的阶级使命，就是为了进一步执行美帝在亚洲的侵略政策，搞日美军事同盟条约，给岸信介撑腰。他极端地蔑视说，艾森豪威尔这次来得很好，他不来，可能还激不起亚洲人民这样更强烈的反美怒潮。现在他吃了日本人民的“闭门羹”，又受到了我国人民大炮的“欢迎”，这使全世界人民更加看清楚了帝国主义是怎样一天一天地烂下去，看清楚了美帝国主义是一只名副其实的“纸老虎”。张奚若说，我们对艾森豪威尔迎送的“礼炮”，表示中国人民对美帝国主义头子的蔑视和鄙视，表现了我国人民大无畏的气概，这是强大的武装示威。这“礼炮”对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界反帝反殖民主义斗争的人民是一个很大的支持和鼓舞。
    陈叔通在会上说，我们全国人民对于屠夫艾森豪威尔的“访台”阴谋，表示无比的愤慨。中国人民决不能允许美帝国主义长期侵占我国神圣领土台湾，台湾同胞也决不能容忍美帝长期的残酷蹂躏。英勇的台湾同胞一定能够打烂美帝的枷锁，回到祖国的怀抱。
    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊说，艾森豪威尔不顾亚洲人民的强烈反对，坚持要到远东来策划新战争阴谋，但在日本人民英勇的斗争下，他终于不得不被迫宣布“延期”到日本去，这又一次暴露了美帝国主义这只纸老虎的原形。他说，艾森豪威尔是一个瘟神，对付瘟神应当用炮轰。美帝国主义处处以中国人民为敌，我们强大的中国人民过去已给了美帝国主义不少教训，今后还将给它更大的教训。我们一定要解放台湾，一定要把美帝国主义从台湾驱逐出去。
    中国农工民主党主席团委员郭则沉说，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔在日本、南朝鲜、土耳其等国的傀儡有的已被推翻，有的正在摇摇欲坠的时候，他不得不甘冒风险，亲自出马到亚洲来给他的走狗们打气撑腰，妄想压制亚洲各国人民的爱国正义斗争。他说，这一切都激起了亚洲各国人民的强烈反对。我们严正警告艾森豪威尔：强大的社会主义中国，有足够粉碎任何侵略的力量，你们对我们每一次的挑衅，都一定要受到加倍的回击。最后他高呼：“瘟神艾森豪威尔滚回去！”
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说，在美帝国主义占领我国领土台湾十周年的时候，艾森豪威尔又到台湾来进一步制造阴谋，加紧对我国的军事挑衅，这激起了我们全中国人民无可遏止的愤怒。
    他说，我军在福建前线炮轰“瘟神”，完全表达了全中国人民支持亚洲各国人民和台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争的坚强意志，表达了中国人民一定要解放台湾的坚定信心。他断言，艾森豪威尔已尝到了亚洲人民的教训，更大更沉重的教训还等待着他。
    九三学社主席许德珩说，艾森豪威尔到台湾，是对站起来了的六亿五千万中国人民的严重挑衅，也是对亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的严重威胁。这个双手沾满亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民鲜血的刽子手，这次的强盗旅行完全是为了准备和布置新的侵略战争。不粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，不打倒美帝国主义，就决没有和平可言。台湾海峡强大的炮声，表达了六亿五千万中国人民正义的愤怒的吼声。
    台湾民主自治同盟秘书长徐萌山说，1950年6月27日美帝国主义公开武装侵占台湾以来，再过几天就十周年了。十年来，美国侵略者野蛮地掠夺和摧残台湾同胞，把我国美丽富庶的宝岛台湾变成了一个人间大地狱，对台湾同胞犯下了滔天罪行。今天，全世界人民的头号敌人、战争贩子艾森豪威尔又到我国台湾进行所谓“访问”，妄想继续推行制造“两个中国”、永久霸占台湾和坚决与我国人民为敌的侵略政策，并且在台湾海峡猖狂备战，加剧远东地区的紧张局势。这是对中国人民的严重挑衅，我们表示强烈的抗议。
    徐萌山说，我们警告美国侵略者，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，绝不容许美国制造“两个中国”，绝不容许它永久霸占台湾的阴谋实现。中国人民一定要解放台湾，美国军队必须从台湾地区滚出去。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员邵力子说，艾森豪威尔这次是硬着头皮来远东进行“访问”的，他的内心充满了恐惧。艾森豪威尔除了遇到人民的反抗以外，在台湾他还将遇到另一种抵抗的力量。邵力子强调说，台湾的军政人员，甚至蒋介石本人，他们能够同意美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋吗？
    无党派民主人士章士钊说，美帝国主义长期以来就企图迫使蒋介石以放弃金门、马祖来换取“两个中国”的阴谋，中国人民坚决反对。台、澎、金、马永远不能析离，我们中国人民有足够的力量来使台、澎、金、马一起回到祖国的怀抱。
    民盟副主席邓初民在发言中说，我们中国人民对美帝国主义的头子、杀人的凶犯、血淋淋的刽子手艾森豪威尔，胆敢到台湾来策划战争阴谋和敌视我国的强盗行为，提出最严重的抗议和声讨。他说，历史的经验已经证明，任何反动派，任何发动侵略战争的人，到头来都要造成自己的死亡。艾森豪威尔的这次强盗旅行，正是一次走向死亡的旅行。邓初民最后激昂地高呼：“美国侵略者滚出台湾去，开炮！”
    无党派民主人士王芸生说，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾人民不是孤立的，他们有强大的祖国六亿五千万英雄的同胞作后盾。我福建前线发出轰鸣的炮声，就响亮地告诉了美帝国主义强盗头子艾森豪威尔，美帝国主义必须从台湾滚回去！要想死赖着不走，它的结局将不会比当年台湾人民赶走西班牙、荷兰、日本等殖民主义强盗的命运好些。王芸生愤怒地高呼：“滚！美国强盗！”
    民革中央常务委员钱昌照激愤地说，战争贩子艾森豪威尔到台湾进一步暴露了制造“两个中国”的阴谋和坚持与中国人民为敌的侵略政策。他的台湾之行激起了中国人民无比的愤怒。中国人民解放军在福建前线轰击“瘟神”的大炮的正义之声响彻云霄，觉醒了的亚洲人民完全懂得如何教训这个头号战争贩子的。
    台盟成员陈文彬说，被激怒了的亚洲人民已经用或者准备用适当的方式来“欢迎”“欢送”艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”。菲律宾人民用石头，日本人民用“闭门羹”，我们中国人民用大炮发表“欢迎词”和“欢送词”，已经赶走了艾森豪威尔所崇拜的“伟大人物”的李承晚的朝鲜人民也会有所表示。我们台湾同胞也懂得怎样来“接待”这个瘟神的。我深信，台湾同胞一定会和人民解放军在福建前线的炮轰相配合，给这个“瘟神”应得的“接待”。
    台盟成员苏子蘅说，作为一个台湾人，我对艾森豪威尔的这次台湾之行的阴谋活动表示坚决反对。艾森豪威尔玩弄新的花招，阴谋制造所谓“台湾人的台湾”，煽动台湾人民脱离祖国，竭力鼓动一小撮亲美的“台湾独立分子”，在艾森豪威尔到台湾时进行“请愿”，要求美国“援助”，美帝国主义企图以这种卑鄙手段达到实现“孤立台湾”、“托管台湾”的目的。但是美帝国主义的阴谋诡计是不能得逞的。台、澎、金、马的军民同胞应该团结起来，和全国人民一道，为反对把台湾作为发动侵略战争的跳板而斗争到底。
    出席座谈会的还有民革副主席何香凝、蔡廷锴，民盟副主席史良、胡愈之，民建副主任委员胡子昂，民进副主席许广平、杨东蓴，农工主席团委员夏康农、王人旋，九三学社副主席周培源、严济慈，无党派民主人士竺可桢和各民主党派的中央常务委员、中央委员等共一百二十多人。
