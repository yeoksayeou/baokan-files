Xinhua News Agency, June 11th – Two leaders of the Congolese political party delegation currently visiting our country stated to our reporter today that after achieving political independence, the Congolese people will continue to struggle for complete economic independence.

	Alphonse Makwambala, leader of the Congolese political party delegation, said that while granting political independence to the Congo, Belgian colonialists are still using various conspiracies to try to maintain their economic privileges, leaving the Congolese people to live in poverty. He said: "We will continue to struggle, not only to achieve political independence, but also to demand economic independence."

	Henri Kasongo, another leader of the delegation, told reporters that U.S. imperialists and Belgian colonialists are the same ilk, even worse. Other members of the delegation present during the interview added that it was American weapons that slaughtered the Congolese people, and Congo's valuable natural resources such as uranium and cobalt were all sold to the United States. Even today, Congo's treasury is not even in Belgium, but in the United States.

	Makwambala said that U.S. imperialism is colluding with Belgian colonialism to plunder Congo's wealth. He said: "After coming to China, we have a clearer understanding of the face of U.S. imperialism."

	Speaking about his impressions of visiting China, Makwambala said that we admire the achievements China has made in just ten short years after liberation. He said: "What is even more touching is that we see that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggles of all colonial peoples, sympathize with colonial peoples everywhere, and provide moral support."

	Kasongo said that China's achievements are not only amazing, but also "simply unimaginable without seeing them with your own eyes." Now China can not only manufacture airplanes and cars, and exploit the minerals it needs, but more importantly, China has no unemployed people.

	Other members of the delegation said: "Despite the imperialists' rumors, China is advancing by leaps and bounds."

	Both Makwambala and Kasongo emphasized that the Congolese people should strengthen friendly exchanges with the Chinese people in the future. They said that imperialism is the same whether in Africa or in Asia, and our anti-imperialist struggle has the same goal.

	They also expressed their intention to bring back to the Congo the Chinese people's profound brotherly friendship towards the Congolese people, and wished the Chinese people happiness and joy.

    刚果政党代表团两领导人发表谈话
    斥美帝国主义掠夺刚果财富
    据新华社11日讯　正在我国访问的刚果政党代表团的两位领导人今天向本社记者分别发表谈话时指出，刚果人民在政治上独立以后，将继续斗争，要求经济上也取得完全的独立。
    刚果政党代表团领导人阿方斯·马克万巴拉说，比利时殖民主义者在政治上给予刚果独立的同时，仍在使用各种阴谋诡计，妄图保持他们经济上的特权，使刚果人民依然过贫困的生活。他说：“我们将继续斗争，不仅要取得政治上的独立，而且要求经济上的独立。”
    代表团的另一位领导人亨利·卡松戈向记者说，美帝国主义者和比利时殖民主义者是一样的货色，甚至更坏。访问时在场的代表团的其他成员补充说，屠杀刚果人民的是美国的武器，刚果的贵重天然资源如铀、钴等全部卖给美国，而直到今天为止，刚果的国库甚至于不在比利时，而是在美国。
    马克万巴拉说，美帝国主义同比利时殖民主义勾结在一起，掠夺刚果的财富。他说：“到中国以后，我们对美帝国主义的面目认识得更清楚了。”
    在谈到访问中国的观感时，马克万巴拉说，我们对中国在解放后短短十年内所取得的成就表示钦佩。他说：“更使人感动的是，我们看到中国人民是坚决支持一切殖民地人民的正义斗争的，处处同情殖民地人民并给予道义上的支持。”
    卡松戈说，中国的成就不仅令人惊奇，而且是“不亲眼看见简直是不可想像的”。现在中国不仅能制造飞机、汽车，开采自己需要的矿产，而更重要的是中国没有失业者。
    代表团的其他成员说：“尽管帝国主义者造谣，但是中国在大踏步地前进。”
    马克万巴拉和卡松戈都强调今后刚果人民应同中国人民加强友好往来。他们说，帝国主义不管是在非洲，或是在亚洲都是一样的，我们的反帝斗争目标是一致的。
    他们还表示把中国人民对刚果人民的兄弟般的深厚友谊带回刚果，并且祝中国人民愉快幸福。
