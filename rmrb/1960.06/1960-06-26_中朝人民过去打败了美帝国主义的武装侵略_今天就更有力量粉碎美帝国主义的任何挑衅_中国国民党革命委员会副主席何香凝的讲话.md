Comrades, friends:
　　Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a rally against US aggression in Korea and in support of the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their country. We, the democratic parties, pledge to stand with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to resolutely oppose the US imperialist policy of aggression and war, and resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country.
　　Ten years ago, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea and spread the flames of war to the Yalu River. The Korean people, in order to defend their country, launched a heroic national liberation war and dealt a heavy blow to US imperialism. The Chinese people also sent the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people, and finally defeated the US aggressors and forced US imperialism to sign an armistice agreement. This great victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a brilliant example of opposing US imperialism, and it also powerfully illustrates that as long as the people of all countries unite and wage a resolute struggle, the US robbers will not be able to escape the fate of a miserable defeat.
　　Although the US aggressors suffered a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, the imperialist nature is hard to change. They are struggling to the death, constantly carrying out conspiracies, expanding their armaments, preparing for war, and creating tension everywhere. Recently, Eisenhower, the chieftain of US imperialism, in order to maintain the US's aggressive bases in Asia and strengthen its oppression of the people of Asian countries, personally came forward and stepped up his conspiratorial activities in the Far East. The people of Asian countries have long recognized US imperialism as their most ferocious enemy, and they will never allow Eisenhower's conspiracy to plot a new war to succeed. Eisenhower, this plague god, has been opposed everywhere, and his "robber trip" has finally suffered a shameful defeat.
　　The Chinese and Korean people, who have rich experience in the struggle against imperialism, know how to deal with US robbers. They will not be deceived, nor will they be afraid of threats. If US imperialism puts on a false face of peace, we will thoroughly expose its true nature of preparing for war; if it launches a war of aggression, we will resolutely cut off its evil claws. The great Chinese people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan, thoroughly smash the US imperialist plot to create "two Chinas," fully support the Japanese people's struggle to smash the US-Japan military alliance treaty, fully support the Korean and Vietnamese people's struggle to drive out US imperialism and peacefully reunify their countries, and fully support the struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against US imperialist aggression and oppression. We, the Chinese people, are determined to unite with the people of the world and carry the struggle against US imperialism to the end.
　　The Chinese and Korean people defeated the armed aggression of US imperialism. Today, we are even more powerful to smash any conspiracies and provocations by US imperialism. At present, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is incomparably strong, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are in full swing, and the struggle of the people of all countries in the world, including the American people, against imperialist aggression and in defense of peace is unprecedentedly high. US imperialism is already in a state of siege on all sides, and it is at the end of its rope. Its lifespan is not long, and any death throes can only accelerate its own demise. We, the Chinese people, must unite with the people of the world to form the broadest united front against imperialism, carry out unremitting struggle, and drive the US aggressors out of Taiwan, out of Japan, out of the Philippines, South Korea, and South Vietnam, and out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
　　People of the world, unite and overthrow US imperialism!

    中朝人民过去打败了美帝国主义的武装侵略
    今天就更有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    今天我们首都各界人民举行反对美国侵略朝鲜、支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国大会。我们各民主党派誓与全国人民一道，在中国共产党领导下，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争。
    十年前，美帝国主义对朝鲜发动了侵略战争，并把战火燃烧到鸭绿江边。朝鲜人民为了保卫自己的国家，展开了英勇的民族解放战争，给予美帝国主义以沉重打击。中国人民也派出了英雄的中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民一道作战，终于把美国侵略军打得落花流水，迫使美帝国主义不得不签订停战协定。中朝人民这一伟大的胜利，是反对美帝国主义的光辉范例，它也有力地说明，只要各国人民团结起来、坚决进行斗争，美国强盗就无法逃脱惨败的命运。
    美国侵略者虽然在朝鲜战场遭受到惨重的失败，但是，帝国主义的本性难移，至死不悟，它继续不断地作垂死的挣扎，到处进行阴谋活动，扩军备战，制造紧张局势。最近，美帝国主义的强盗头子艾森豪威尔，为了维持美国在亚洲的侵略基地，加强它对亚洲各国人民的压迫，又亲自出马，到远东加紧进行阴谋活动。亚洲各国人民早已认准美帝国主义是他们最凶恶敌人，他们绝不让艾森豪威尔策划新战争的阴谋得逞。艾森豪威尔这个瘟神到处遭到反对，他的“强盗旅行”终于遭到可耻的失败。
    对帝国主义有着丰富斗争经验的中国和朝鲜人民，是知道怎样对付美国强盗的，既不会受骗，更不怕威胁。美帝国主义装出假和平的面孔，我们就彻底揭穿它真备战的本质；它发动侵略战争，我们就坚决斩断它的魔手。伟大的中国人民一定要解放自己的神圣领土台湾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，全力支持日本人民粉碎日美军事同盟条约的斗争，全力支持朝鲜人民和越南人民赶走美帝国主义、和平统一祖国的斗争，全力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反抗美帝国主义侵略、压迫的斗争。我们中国人民决心同全世界的人民一起，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    中朝人民打败了美帝国主义的武装侵略。今天我们更有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何阴谋和挑衅。目前，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营无比强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动如火如荼，世界各国人民包括美国人民在内的反对帝国主义侵略，保卫和平的斗争空前高涨。美帝国主义已经处于四面楚歌，日暮途穷，它的寿命不长了，它的任何垂死挣扎，都只能加速自己的灭亡。我们中国人民一定要同全世界人民结成最广泛的反帝统一战线，进行不懈的斗争，把美国侵略者从台湾赶出去，从日本赶出去，从非律宾、南朝鲜、南越赶出去，从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲赶出去！
    全世界人民团结起来打倒美帝国主义！
