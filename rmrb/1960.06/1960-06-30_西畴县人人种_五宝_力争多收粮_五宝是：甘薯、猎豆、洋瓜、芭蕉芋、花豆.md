(Reported by this newspaper) The people of Xichou County, known throughout Yunnan Province for planting "Five Treasures" (namely hunter beans, pumpkins, Canna edulis, kidney beans, and sweet potatoes), are, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, simultaneously focusing on field management of basic farmland and diversifying crops to increase yields. The county is carrying out a "Ten No Vacancy" campaign, planting "Five Treasures" extensively, and striving to harvest grain everywhere. By June 18th, on the basis of having already planted 160,000 mu of "Five Treasures," the county had planted another 123,349 mu of pumpkins, cowpeas, millet, red rice, and Digitaria.

The Xichou County Party Committee divided the county's eighteen communes into five large areas, with secretaries and standing committee members assigned to lead the masses (commune party committees responsible for managing districts, management district party branch members responsible for production teams, with responsibilities assigned at each level) in planting gourds and beans extensively. The county has投入 (I have translated this as "mobilised" but if there is a better word for the context let me know) over 93,000 laborers in the rush to plant "Five Treasures." In the mass campaign to cultivate "Five Treasures" on the mountains, the Jijie Commune created the "Ten No Vacancy" approach. The "Ten No Vacancy" are: No empty spaces in the fields, plant pumpkins and rice beans; no empty spaces in front of and behind houses, plant pumpkins and sword beans; no empty spaces along ditches and roadsides, plant kidney beans and soybeans; no empty spaces on barren mountains and wasteland, plant potatoes and Canna edulis; no empty spaces in orchards, plant sweet potatoes and cowpeas; no empty spaces in ponds and muddy ponds, plant glutinous rice and fresh lotus roots; no empty spaces in manure heaps and manure ponds, plant red rice and soybeans; no empty spaces around stables and toilets, plant pumpkins and soybeans; no empty spaces on and off the threshing ground, plant kidney beans and millet; no empty spaces in idle fields and land, plant corn and sorghum. After the "Ten No Vacancy" movement was launched, four communes quickly planted 3,900 mu of gourds, beans, millet, red rice, and Digitaria. Commune members said: "The 'Ten No Vacancy' is really good. It doesn't take up land, requires little labor, yields high outputs, and generates more income." After the county party committee summarized this experience, it immediately held an on-site meeting to vigorously promote it throughout the county.

In the mass movement to implement "Ten No Vacancy" and plant "Five Treasures" extensively, communes, management districts, and production teams launched competitions to fully plant and cultivate. The Xisha Commune and Laojie Commune launched a direct competition. The Xisha Commune mobilized 6,300 laborers, with production teams as the units, to inspect and take action simultaneously. The commune quickly expanded planting, sowing 8,759 mu of gourds, beans, and miscellaneous grains in just over ten days. The Laojie Commune proposed the slogan "Everyone plants gourds, everyone sows beans, let a hundred flowers bloom, let a myriad of colors flourish, adapt to local conditions, plant extensively," and everyone participated in the blitz, planting thousands and thousands of treasures.

    西畴县人人种“五宝”力争多收粮
    五宝是：甘薯、猎豆、洋瓜、芭蕉芋、花豆
    本报讯　以种“五宝（即猎豆、洋瓜、芭蕉芋、花豆、甘薯）”山闻名云南全省的西畴县人民，在各级党委领导下，一手抓基本农田的田间管理，一手抓多种多收。全县开展“十不空”运动，大种“五宝”，争取遍地收粮食。到6月18日，全县在已种“五宝”十六万亩的基础上，又种下南瓜、缸豆、小米、红米、地谷十二万三千三百四十九亩。
    中共西畴县委将全县十八个公社分为五个大片，由书记和常委分工包干领导群众（公社党委包管理区，管理区党支部成员包生产队，层层分工包干），大种瓜豆。全县投入抢种“五宝”的劳动力，目前已达到九万三千多人，在全民大干“五宝”山的运动中，鸡街公社创造了“十不空”。十不空是：田间地角不空，种上南瓜、饭豆；房前屋后不空，种上洋瓜、刀豆；沟边路边不空，种上花豆、黄豆；荒山荒地不空，种上洋芋、芭蕉芋；果园地不空，种上红薯、缸豆；水塘泥塘不空，栽上糯谷、鲜藕；粪堆粪塘不空，种上红米、黄豆；厩边厕边不空，种上洋瓜、黄豆；场上场下不空，种上花豆、小米；闲田闲地不空，种上包谷、高粱。“十不空”运动搞起来以后，有四个公社很快就种下了瓜豆、小米、红米、地谷三千九百亩。社员说：“十不空”，真是好，不占地，费工小，产量高，收入多。县委总结了这一经验后，马上召开现场会议在全县大力推广。
    在全民大搞“十不空”大种“五宝”的运动中，公社与公社、管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队互相发起比满栽满种的竞赛。西洒公社与老街公社开展对口大比武，西洒公社发动六千三百个劳动力上阵，以生产队为单位，边查边行动，全社扩种进展很快，十多天内种下瓜、豆、杂粮八千七百五十九亩。老街公社提出“人人栽瓜、个个种豆，百花齐放、万紫千红，因地制宜、大栽大种”的口号，人人参加突击，广种千宝、万宝。（附图片）
