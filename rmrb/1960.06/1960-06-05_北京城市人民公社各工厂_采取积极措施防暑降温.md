Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Factories, nurseries, and canteens of the Beijing urban people's communes are actively carrying out heatstroke prevention, temperature reduction, and summer sanitation work.

This work is being carried out under the leadership of the Party committees of the communes, with production as the center, and based on the principle of making use of whatever is available. Most of the commune-run factories have adopted natural ventilation methods, adding windows to the workshops, and adjusting processes in workshops with too many people.

The ampoule workshop of the Chunshu People's Commune Glass Factory in Xuanwu District, with the assistance of the district labor insurance and health and epidemic prevention departments, the factory's leading cadres and commune members worked together to install homemade exhaust pipes to draw the smoke and heat from the workshop out of the room through the chimney. They also bought some old electric fans from the waste product company and converted them into exhaust fans for ventilation. They also prepared their own iced salt soda and extended the midday rest time to protect the health of the workers. Exhaust equipment was also installed in the high-temperature workshops of the Erlong Road People's Commune Chemical Plant. Factories such as the comprehensive factory and the insulation factory of this commune have built sunshades for workers working in the open air.

Many medical departments have also adopted the method of assigning responsibility by zone and designating specific personnel to help the commune's factories, nurseries, and canteens carry out heatstroke prevention and summer sanitation work. Medical departments have generally trained health workers and sanitation workers for the commune's factories and nurseries, and have explained hygiene knowledge to cooks.

    北京城市人民公社各工厂
    采取积极措施防暑降温
    据新华社4日讯　北京各城市人民公社的工厂、托儿组织和食堂，积极进行防暑降温和夏季卫生工作。
    这一工作是在各公社党委领导下，以生产为中心，本着因陋就简的原则进行的。大多数社办工厂都采取自然通风的办法，在车间增开窗户，人员过多的车间就调整工序。
    宣武区椿树人民公社玻璃厂安瓿车间在区劳动保险和卫生防疫部门的协助下，工厂的领导干部和社员一起动手，安上了土制的抽风筒，把车间里的烟雾和热气通过烟筒引出室外，并且从废品公司买了一些旧电扇改装成排风扇来通风。他们还自己配制冰镇盐汽水和延长中午休息时间来保护职工健康。二龙路人民公社化工厂高温车间也都安上了抽风设备。这个公社的综合工厂和绝缘厂等厂给露天操作的工人搭起了凉棚。
    许多医疗部门也采取分片包干、定点定人的办法，帮助公社的工厂、托儿组织、食堂进行防暑和夏季卫生工作。医疗部门普遍为公社的工厂和托儿组织训练了保健员和卫生员，并且为炊事员讲解卫生常识。
