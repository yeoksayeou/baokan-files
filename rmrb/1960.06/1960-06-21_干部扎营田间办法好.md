    Cadres Camping in the Fields is a Good Method
    Not long ago, our commune's Party committee built a thatched shed in the fields and installed a telephone, so that they could participate in production and lead the commune members in strengthening the field management of early rice. As a result, a high tide of rice field management quickly formed throughout the commune.
    When the commune Party secretary was working with the commune members in the Futang high-yield plot, on the one hand, he studied initial management methods for the seedlings with the masses, and on the other hand, he set an example of high-standard management in the command field. In one day, he solved the problems of missing seedlings and excessive weeds in more than 280 mu of early rice fields in the high-yield area. At the same time, he told the situation to the field headquarters of each brigade, and each brigade quickly launched a campaign to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and remove weeds, replanting more than 12,000 mu in one day. Later, it was discovered that some early rice in the high-yield area began to lose fertilizer and turn yellow. Immediately, a four-check and four-compare campaign centered on checking yellow seedlings was launched throughout the commune, mobilizing the broad masses of commune members to check and clean up domestic fertilizer. In two days, the commune cleaned up 230,000 dan of various domestic fertilizers, making it possible to apply top dressing to thousands of mu of yellow seedlings.

    干部扎营田间办法好
    不久以前，我们公社的党委会在田间搭起草棚，装上电话，一面参加生产，一面领导社员加强早稻田间管理，这一来，水稻田间管理很快就在全社形成了高潮。
    公社党委书记在佛堂丰产方同社员一块劳动的时候，一方面同群众在一起研究秧苗初期管理办法，一方面在指挥田作出高标准管理的榜样，一天时间就解决了丰产畈中二百八十多亩早稻田缺苗多、杂草多的问题。同时，把这情况告诉了各大队田头指挥部，各大队很快就掀起查苗、补苗、除草运动，一天就补苗一万二千多亩。后来又在丰产畈中发现一部分早期水稻开始脱肥发黄，当即在全社范围内开展以查黄苗为中心内容的四查四比运动，发动广大社员边检查、边清理家肥，两天中全社清理各种家肥二十三万担，使几千亩黄苗普遍施上一次追肥。
