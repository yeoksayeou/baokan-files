Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 17th: Algiers dispatch: After three days of secret trial by the French colonial military court in Algiers against Ahmed Akashe, secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, and Paul Caballero and others, they were unreasonably sentenced on the 15th to prison terms ranging from five to twenty years and fined.

It was announced that Akashe was sentenced to twenty years in prison, Henri Alleg, the former director of the Algerian Communist Party's newspaper "Republican Algiers" and author of the book "The Question," was sentenced to ten years in prison and fined 3,600 new francs, and other patriots were sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to twenty years. According to French newspapers, when these patriots heard the verdict, they shouted in court, "Long live the independence of the Algerian nation!"

Akashe, Alleg, and others were arrested by the French colonial military authorities in 1957. After their arrest, they were subjected to various tortures for a long time, and some even died as a result of torture. However, they not only did not succumb but also continued to wage a resolute struggle against the colonialists in prison. Alleg also wrote the book "The Question" to expose the atrocities in French colonial prisons.

Just as the French colonial court began its trial against them on June 13, under heavy armed guard, Akashe and others sternly denounced the French colonialists in the colonialists' court as the real murderers who had massacred Algerian patriots. Akashe announced in court that the Algerian Communists were determined to fight alongside the Algerian people with all their strength for Algeria's freedom.

He also bravely denounced the French colonialists' slander against the Algerian Communists. He said: "People say to us: 'You are robbers, you are murderers.' We want to point out where the real murderers are."

He said, "For me, after my arrest, I was subjected to six days and six nights of severe torture in the dungeon of Villa Susini. At that time, in addition to Maurice Audin (who has been killed - editor), Omar Jeli (who has been killed - editor), another Algerian Communist Party member who was arrested with me, was also subjected to horrific and brutal torture." Akashe said, "I accuse those murderers who killed Jeli and killed Audin."

Akashe pointed out that the blood of patriots was flowing everywhere on Algerian soil. He said, "The real terrorists are not us, but those who have imposed their laws on Algeria for more than a century."

Akashe said, "We, the members of the Algerian Communist Party, are carrying out the national liberation struggle together with our brothers of the National Liberation Front"; "We are proud to be Algerians, and we are doing our best to fight for the freedom of Algeria." Akashe then pointed out that the French colonial authorities had no right to try them at all.

The French colonialists, fearing that their atrocities would be exposed, immediately announced that the trial would be held in secret shortly after it began.

    使原告成被告　变法庭为讲坛
    阿尔及利亚共产党人正义凛然
    法国殖民法庭悍然判决阿卡歇等人长期徒刑
    新华社巴黎17日电　阿尔及尔消息：法国在阿尔及尔的殖民军事法庭对阿尔及利亚共产党书记艾哈迈德·阿卡歇和保罗·卡巴列罗等进行了三天秘密审讯以后，在15日无理判决他们五年到二十年的徒刑和罚款。
    据宣布，阿卡歇被判决二十年徒刑，阿尔及利亚共产党前机关报“共和阿尔及尔报”社长、“拷问”一书的作者亨利·阿勒格被判决十年徒刑和三千六百新法郎罚款，其他一些爱国者被分别判决五年到二十年的徒刑。据法国报纸报道说，这些爱国者当听到判决时在法庭上高呼“阿尔及利亚民族独立万岁！”
    阿卡歇和阿勒格等人是1957年被法国殖民军事当局逮捕的。被捕后，他们长期受到各种酷刑，有的甚至因受酷刑致死。但是，他们不仅不屈服，而且继续在监狱里同殖民者展开坚决的斗争。阿勒格还写了“拷问”一书揭露法国殖民监狱中的暴行。
    就在6月13日法国殖民法庭在武装军警戒备森严下开始对他们进行审讯时，阿卡歇等人在殖民者的法庭上严词控诉法国殖民者是残杀阿尔及利亚爱国者的真正杀人犯。阿卡歇在法庭上宣布，阿尔及利亚共产党人决心同阿尔及利亚人民一道，全力为争取阿尔及利亚的自由而战斗。
    他还英勇地斥责了法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚共产党人的污蔑。他说：“人们对我们说：‘你们是一些强盗，是一些杀人犯’。我们要指出真正的杀人犯在那里”。
    他说，“对我来说，在我被捕之后，我在苏齐尼别墅中的地牢中经受了六天六夜的严刑拷打。当时，除了莫里斯·奥登（已被杀害——编者）以外，另一个同我一起被捕的阿尔及利亚共产党党员奥马尔·杰里（已被杀害——编者）也受到了骇人听闻的残酷的拷打”。阿卡歇说，“我控告那些杀害了杰里、杀害了奥登的杀人犯。”
    阿卡歇指出，在阿尔及利亚的土地上到处流着爱国者的鲜血。他说，“真正的恐怖分子不是我们，而是一个多世纪以来把自己的法律强加于阿尔及利亚的那些人”。
    阿卡歇说，“我们，阿尔及利亚共产党的党员们，同我们的民族解放阵线的兄弟们一道进行民族解放斗争”；“我们作为阿尔及利亚人而感到自豪，我们都竭尽全力为争取阿尔及利亚的自由而战”。阿卡歇接着指出，法国殖民当局根本没有权利审讯他们。
    法国殖民者害怕他们的暴行被揭露，因此在开庭不久立即宣布审讯秘密进行。
