    Yuci City Vigorously Promotes Intercropping of Trees and Grains
    Yuci City, Shanxi Province, is vigorously promoting the intercropping of trees and grains. As of early June, all 140,000 mu of woodland in the city had been intercropped with grain and other crops. The land intercropped with trees and grains is expected to yield 200 jin per mu. This initiative alone could increase grain production by 28 million jin in the city. Based on the city's agricultural population of 140,000, this translates to an average increase of 200 jin of grain per person.

    Heilongjiang and Jilin Rush to Plant Rice
    Heilongjiang and Jilin are continuing to intensify rice planting. By mid-June, the two provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang had completed half of their rice planting plans. Since the beginning of summer, the temperature in the Northeast region has been lower than usual, and rice seedlings have been growing slowly. Various methods have been adopted to promote seedling growth, such as steam cultivation, oil-paper seedling cultivation, draining fields for sun exposure, and topdressing with fertilizer. Recently, the progress of rice transplanting has accelerated. In Jilin Province, cadres at six levels have joined forces in the fields, leading commune members in summer hoeing while also directing rice transplanting work in various locations, doubling the province's transplanting progress. During transplanting, over 60,000 rice transplanters have been promoted and used in the Northeast, and some direct-seeding rice has also used planters.

    Ewes in Guinan County Give Birth Twice a Year
    In Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, more than 80,000 ewes that gave birth to winter lambs are now starting to lamb again after estrus induction and heat matching, with less than half a year between the two lambing periods. Last winter, under the call of the Guinan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, communes in Guinan County selected more than 130,000 healthy ewes of appropriate age to induce estrus with pregnant mare serum, refrigerated pregnant cow blood, and other methods after giving birth. A total of 82,560 ewes were successfully mated. Currently, these pregnant sheep have already given birth to 1,890 lambs, including seven ewes that gave birth to twins. The lambs are all strong and healthy, with a survival rate of over 97%.

To date, the farm has a total of 382 pigs, including 272 piglets. Except for three piglets that were crushed to death, all the piglets have survived and are healthy. This livestock farm has become the first "five-full" (fully mated, fully pregnant, fully born, fully alive, fully strong) high-yielding livestock farm in Linhai County.

        Jincheng County Widely Establishes Breeding Bases
    Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, based on the principle of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use," has launched a mass movement to establish breeding bases. The county has established more than 400 crop breeding sites covering over 100,000 mu, cultivated more than 7,000 mu of various seedlings, established 270 breeding bases for pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses, and raised 893 head of breeding livestock. In addition, many superior breeds of chickens, ducks, rabbits, and fish have also been cultivated.
