　　Strengthen Concrete Leadership, Foster Close Relations Between Cadres and Masses, and Ensure Sustained Production Leap Forward
　　Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory Leaders Go Deep into Production and Form a System
　　Their approach is: within one week, one day for study, two days for research and summarizing work, and three days going deep into the workshop to participate in production.
　　This Dispatch from Tianjin, 10th – The Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory has implemented an "one, two, three" leadership system, strengthening concrete leadership over production and further fostering closer ties between cadres and the masses, ensuring a sustained leap forward in production. The output of internal combustion engines increased by seventy units in April compared to March, and by another one hundred and thirty-five units in May compared to April. By the end of May, this factory had completed 66.9% of the state's order for coal gas engines.
　　The "one, two, three" system means that factory-level cadres, especially factory-level leading cadres, spend one day a week studying, two days holding meetings to research and summarize work, and three days going deep into the workshops to participate in and lead production, specifically resolving problems in production and work.
　　During the implementation of the "one, two, three" system, some cadres initially, due to their habit of sitting in the office, were not good at going deep into the workshops to solve problems. Some cadres, after arriving at the workshops, would simply walk around and look, thinking they had completed their task. The factory Party committee, in response to this situation, on the one hand, carried out education for all cadres on going deep and doing work; on the other hand, the Party committee secretary personally went deep into the workshops as a model and reported his working methods and some specific situations in the workshop work to all cadres. This way, while educating and leading, the superficial and shallow work style among the cadres was gradually resolved.
　　In the specific execution of this system, some people were unable to guarantee the time spent deep in production due to the entanglement of affairs. The factory Party committee believes that correctly resolving the division of labor on the battlefront and the contradiction of going deep into the workshops is the key to thoroughly implementing the "one, two, three" system. Through exploration in practice, four measures were proposed to solve this problem. First, bring business work (such as production scheduling, raw material supply, etc.) to the workshop and combine it with production. This not only solves the problem of business work and going deep into reality, but also, due to going deep into work, production scheduling is more reasonable, and raw material supply is more timely, further promoting production. Second, the Party committee also provides specific care for the work of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other departments, based on different work content, when dividing up responsibility for workshops. After each department takes responsibility for a workshop, it is combined with conducting "experimental plots." By focusing on key points, "dissecting sparrows," and using the points to lead the whole, the entire factory is directed. Third, in order to organically combine the work between different departments, they promoted the experience of Wuqiao County, "go down together to grasp everything, then come back and divide the work." Various departments take responsibility for workshops, grasping production, life, and ideology together. When leading cadres meet every day or every other day, they exchange information with each other. The problems that are gathered are handled by the battlefront or department responsible for that area. Fourth, in order to promote the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, in addition to fixed forces going to the workshops, a mobile force consisting of cadres from various departments within the factory was organized, led by the factory's responsible cadres. Wherever there is a key issue, they go there to solve it, and then organize and promote it on the spot, making the leadership methods that go deep into the workshops more adaptable to the needs of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.
　　Since the implementation of the "one, two, three" system, the relationship between leaders and the masses has been further strengthened, enabling leaders to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, promoting the continuous leap forward in production. Since April of this year, factory-level leading cadres alone have deeply discovered and mobilized the workers and masses to solve eleven relatively major key problems. Due to adhering to the "one, two, three" system, leading cadres have comprehensively and deeply grasped the actual situation, and the resolutions made by the Party committee are more in line with reality. By the end of May, the production of irrigation and drainage equipment by this factory had completed 66.4% of the annual plan, and labor productivity had increased by 213.3%.
　　After the implementation of the "one, two, three" system, because cadres solved many problems at the grassroots level when they went deep into the front line of production, the cadres' study time was also guaranteed.

    加强具体领导　密切干群关系　保证生产持续跃进
    天津内燃机厂领导深入生产形成制度
    他们的做法是：在一周内，一天学习，两天研究、总结工作，三天深入车间参加生产。
    本报天津10日电　天津市内燃机厂实行“一、二、三”的领导制度，加强了对生产的具体领导，进一步密切了干部和群众的联系。保证了生产的持续跃进。内燃机的产量，4月比3月增加七十台，5月又比4月增加一百三十五台，到5月底，这个厂已完成国家煤气机订货任务的66．9％。
    “一、二、三”制，就是厂级干部特别是厂级领导干部，在一周内，有一天时间学习，两天时间开会研究、总结工作，三天时间深入车间参加生产、领导生产，具体解决生产、工作中的问题。
    在推行“一、二、三”制的过程中，开始有少数干部由于习惯了坐办公室，不善于深入车间解决问题，有的干部到车间后走走看看，就认为完成了任务。厂党委针对这种情况，一方面对全体干部进行了深入下去作工作的教育；另一方面，党委书记亲自深入车间作样板，并向全体干部汇报他的工作方法和车间工作中的一些具体情况。这样一边教育，一边带动，干部中的浮而不深的思想作风就逐步得到解决。
    在具体执行这个制度时，有些人因为事务的牵扯，不能保证深入生产的时间。厂党委认为正确解决战线的分工和深入车间的矛盾，是彻底实行“一、二、三”制的关键。通过在实践中的摸索，提出解决这个问题的四条措施。一、把业务工作（像生产调度、原料供应等等）带到车间和生产结合进行。这样不仅解决了业务工作和深入实际的问题，同时，由于深入工作，生产调度得更合理，原料供应得更及时，进一步推动了生产。二、工会、共青团等部门工作，党委也根据不同的工作内容，在分工包车间时，给予具体照顾。各部门包车间后，又和搞“试验田”结合起来，通过抓重点，“解刮麻雀”，以点带面，指挥全厂。三、为了把条条块块之间的工作有机地结合起来，他们推行了吴桥县“下去一齐抓、回来再分家”的经验，各个科室分包车间，生产、生活、思想一齐抓，每天或每隔一天领导干部碰头时，互相交流情况，对于汇集起的问题，属于那条战线、那个科室，就由那条战线、那个科室负责处理。四、为了推动技术革新、技术革命运动的深入开展，除固定力量下车间外，又组织了一组有厂内各科室干部参加的机动力量，由厂的负责干部带领，哪里有关键，就到哪里解决，解决后就地组织推广，使深入车间的领导方法，更加适应技术革新和技术革命运动的需要。
    推行“一、二、三”制以来，进一步密切了领导与群众的关系，使领导能够及时地发现问题，解决问题，促进了生产的不断跃进。自今年4月份以来，光厂级领导干部深入发现和发动职工群众解决的比较重大的关键问题就有十一项。由于坚持了“一、二、三”制，领导干部全面深入地掌握了实际情况，党委所作出的决议更加切合实际。到5月底，这个厂排灌设备的生产已完成全年计划的66．4％，劳动生产率提高213．3％。
    推行“一、二、三”制以后，由于干部在深入生产第一线时，就在下边把很多问题解决了，干部的学习时间也得到了保证。
