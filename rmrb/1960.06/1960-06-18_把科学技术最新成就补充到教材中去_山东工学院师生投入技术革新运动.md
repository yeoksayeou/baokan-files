Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 17th: Teachers and students of Shandong Institute of Technology are actively participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, rapidly incorporating the latest achievements of science and technology in production practice into teaching materials, thus greatly promoting the teaching reform of the school.

This spring, taking advantage of the excellent situation of the 1960s, teachers and students of Shandong Institute of Technology quickly plunged into the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The graduation designs of more than 770 graduating students were started five months ahead of schedule, and they went to more than ten provinces and cities, delving into 52 factories, design institutes, and scientific research institutions to carry out activities. Third-year teachers and students carried out activities in 47 factories and enterprises in Jinan City. First and second-year students also vigorously engaged in the technical revolution on campus. In the past few months, graduates have completed the technical design of 56 major projects, and teachers and students of the entire institute have completed a total of 388 technical innovation projects. At the same time, the entire institute, on the one hand, has established ties with relevant factories in the province to cooperate with advanced producers in conducting scientific research on major key production problems; on the other hand, it has sent a large number of teachers to participate in national and regional professional conferences, bringing back many important research topics, and has completed 209 scientific research projects in the past two months. The research and promotion of modern mathematical operations research and other projects have played a significant role in industrial and agricultural production and transportation.

Teachers and students also continuously delve into industrial and mining enterprises to summarize advanced production experience and help with theoretical analysis; in cooperation with relevant scientific research departments, they have researched and developed various highly efficient drainage and irrigation machines suitable for use in mountainous areas and plains, such as two-stroke internal combustion water pumps; they have designed and manufactured simple combined machine tools, assisted communes in achieving the complete set of local electric motors and other equipment, and have established long-term ties with five communes to help them equip commune-run industries.

In the process of participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, teachers and students have gained extremely rich experience. Moreover, they deeply realized that the original teaching syllabus, teaching plan, teaching materials, and teaching methods are in many aspects unable to meet the requirements of production development and technological revolution. They saw in the movement that production is the most dynamic thing, and the latest achievements in production and science and technology often cannot be quickly reflected in teaching, so they urgently demand teaching reform. Under this circumstance, they boldly reformed the curriculum content, removed outdated parts, and added many modern scientific and technological knowledge. Now, the entire school's teaching outlook has undergone great changes, many new teaching materials have been compiled, a large number of the latest scientific and technological materials have been collected, the curriculum content has been refreshed, teaching methods have been improved, a large number of new teaching aids have been created, instruments and equipment have been added, laboratories have been enriched and expanded, and the academic level of teachers and students has been improved, while some class hours have been appropriately reduced. At present, teachers and students have put forward a series of new proposals related to educational plans, curriculum settings, and teaching syllabuses, preparing to carry out teaching reforms step by step according to the principle of "appropriately shortening the duration of schooling, appropriately increasing the degree of depth, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor."

    把科学技术最新成就补充到教材中去
    山东工学院师生投入技术革新运动
    据新华社济南17日电　山东工学院师生积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动，把生产实际中科学技术的最新成就迅速补充到教材中去，因而大大促进了学校的教学改革。
    山东工学院师生在今年春季就趁六十年代的大好形势，迅速投入了技术革新和技术革命运动。七百七十多名应届毕业生的毕业设计提前五个月进行，他们分赴十多个省市，深入五十二个工厂、设计院和科学研究机关开展活动。三年级师生在济南市的四十七个工厂企业里开展活动。一、二年级学生也在校内大闹技术革命。几个月来，毕业生已完成了五十六个重大项目的技术设计，全院师生共完成技术革新项目三百八十八个。同时，全院一方面同本省有关工厂挂钩，同先进生产者合作，进行重大生产关键问题的科学研究；一方面派出大批教师，参加全国性和地区性的专业会议，带回许多重要的研究课题，近两个月来完成了科学研究项目二百零九个。像现代数学运筹学等项目的研究与推广运用，就对工农业生产和交通运输起了重大作用。
    师生们还不断深入工矿企业总结先进生产经验，帮助进行理论分析；同有关科学研究部门合作，研究制成了二冲程内燃水泵等多种适于山区、平原使用、效率很高的排灌机械；设计制成了简易组合机床，协助公社实现土电机等设备的配套成龙，并且同五个公社长期挂钩，帮助他们装备社办工业。
    在参加技术革新和技术革命运动中，师生们收获异常丰富。而且深深体会到原有教学大纲、教学计划、教材和教学方法在许多方面都不能适应生产发展和技术革命的要求。他们在运动中看到，生产是最活跃的东西，而生产和科学技术中的最新成就往往不能在教学中迅速得到反映，因此迫切要求教学改革。在这种情况下，他们在课程内容上大胆进行了革新，去掉了陈旧部分，增添了许多现代科学技术知识。现在，整个学校教学面貌已经起了很大变化，编写出许多新教材，搜集了大批最新科学技术资料，刷新了课程内容，改进了教学方法，创制出大批新教具，添制了仪器设备，充实和扩大了实验室，提高了师生学术水平，同时适当减少了一些学时。目前，师生们又提出一系列有关教育计划、课程设置、教学大纲等的新方案，准备根据“适当缩短年限、适当提高程度、适当控制学时、适当增加劳动”的原则，有步骤地进行教学改革。
