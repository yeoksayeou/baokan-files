Striving for Excellence in Book Distribution
Representative of Xinhua Bookstore in Jinan City, Shandong Province Yang Chaosheng

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the correct leadership of the Party and government leading organs of Jinan City, Shandong Province, our Xinhua Bookstore has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and followed the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. Through the sharp ideological weapon of books, we have promptly publicized Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, the unparalleled superiority of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and publicized the Party's various guidelines and policies, disseminating scientific and cultural knowledge and various advanced production experiences. We have brought into play the ideological combat role of book distribution work, and coordinated and promoted the in-depth development of production, learning, and technological revolution movements. We have made book distribution work a powerful tool for the Party's propaganda and education and a capable assistant in organizing the people's cultural life.

Firmly Listen to the Party and Focus on Serving the Center

Book distribution work is a powerful propaganda tool of the Party, and the central task of the Party in various periods must be the central task of the bookstore. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have frequently paid attention to the situation, paid attention to political trends, closely relied on the Party committees and leading organs, understood the intentions of the leaders and the tasks of propaganda and learning, and served the political and production movements in a ring-by-ring manner, never missing an opportunity to cooperate.

Starting from the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in order to publicize the three magic weapons of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and to cooperate with the struggle between the two roads and the socialist education movement, we actively distributed more than 3.75 million copies of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China," "The Great Decade," "Long Live the People's Communes," and "How Should Marxists Treat the Revolutionary Mass Movement," powerfully cooperating with the in-depth development of the movement.

Whether or not we can cooperate with the Party's various political movements in a timely manner and grasp the source of goods is an important key. Without enough books, we cannot cooperate well with the Party's central tasks. Therefore, in cooperating with each movement, we seize the time, grasp the clues, and grasp the books and propaganda early; an early start in everything makes us proactive every step of the way. For example, at the beginning of this year, according to the Party's instructions on vigorously carrying out the Mao Zedong Thought study movement, we put forward the slogan of "Sending Red Flags for Ideological Revolution and Grasping Books to Ensure Learning," on the one hand, we asked the Municipal Party Committee for instructions and understood the plan for studying Mao Zedong's works, and on the other hand, we vigorously grasped the source of goods. We actively added 1.13 million copies of Mao Zedong's works to the national distribution stores, ensuring the urgent needs and striving for initiative. Because the study movement came on strong, the demand was great, and the publication could not keep up with the needs for a while, a new contradiction between supply and demand appeared. In order to promote learning, under the guidance of the idea of "ensuring supply when there are books, and ensuring learning even when there are no books," we came up with a method of collecting and exchanging duplicate and surplus books. On the one hand, we mobilized comrades who had "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Reading Documents Compilation of Socialist Education Courses" to no longer buy pamphlets, and supplied the newly arrived documents to the readers who needed them most urgently; at the same time, we also carried out the work of recovering Chairman Mao's works, and recovered the readers' repeated and stored books to support the readers who did not have books to study. By the end of February, more than 25,000 copies had been recovered, ensuring the urgent needs, regulating the contradiction between supply and demand, and receiving a warm welcome from readers, opening up a new way to solve the contradiction between supply and demand. From the beginning of 1959 to March of this year, we have taken the initiative to cooperate with the Party's various political movements and major work of relevant parties in more than 210 items, supplying more than 8.2 million copies of books. We can deliver the books before and after the start of the movement, and distribute them to the readers in two or three days, fully bringing into play the ideological combat role of books, and making the Party Committee satisfied and the masses satisfied.

Acting as an Advisor for Industrial and Agricultural Production and Providing Keys for Technological Revolution

Under the ideological guidance of everything for high speed and wholeheartedly serving production, we put forward the action slogan of "Acting as an advisor for industrial and agricultural production and providing keys for technological revolution," mobilizing all positive factors. All comrades closely revolved around the Party's production center, sending books to factories and mines, workshops, construction sites, and fields, and actively serving industrial and agricultural production.

In order to support industrial and agricultural production and build socialism at high speed, in addition to understanding the production arrangements, development plans, and scientific research projects from the leading organs and scientific research departments, we also organized all employees to go deep into production, understand the key to production, and do everything possible to find and provide information for production. For example, when the Wende Machine Tool Factory was trying to produce a new product, it lacked a metal material, which affected production. After learning about this situation, we immediately assisted the factory in finding relevant information. After many efforts, we found the book "Material Substitution," which helped the factory to successfully trial-produce it, saving more than 39,000 yuan in cost and quadrupling production.

In October last year, when we saw the "Dazhong Daily" report "Do everything possible to serve increased production and conservation, and concentrate forces to break through technical bottlenecks," we immediately formed a commando team and launched a climax of going deep into factories, mines, organs, universities, and scientific research organs to understand the key, find books for the key, and help solve the key. After three days and nights of hard work, we learned that 1,502 technical bottlenecks needed to be solved urgently, and found 3,151 reference materials for readers. Under the ideological guidance of everything for the convenience of readers, we clipped notes in the books, explaining the key issues that can be solved and the page numbers for reference, and sent them to the readers separately. In the process of searching for information, due to everyone's low scientific level, some of the key issues were even incomprehensible in terms of terminology, but the comrades still did everything possible to check dictionaries and consult experts. If the bookstore did not have the information, they would borrow it from the library, and if the city did not have it, they would entrust the Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing and Shanghai to handle it, helping readers solve many key problems. For example, in order to solve the cracking phenomenon that occurred after watering the cotton field due to soil compaction, the Institute of Hydraulic Science urgently needed the book "Compacted Layer of Cotton Field Irrigation." They ran all over the bookstores in the city but could not buy it, and they could not borrow it from the libraries. Later, they entrusted the bookstore to handle it. We checked the past book distribution records and finally found the book in the provincial library, helping the Institute of Hydraulic Science solve the problem. There are many such examples. In the past year or so, we have distributed more than 3.26 million copies of science and technology books, solving 1,185 key problems for production. Since November 1959 alone, we have taken the initiative to understand more than 3,000 key production issues and supplied more than 4,500 copies of materials. In order to further improve the work of finding information, all outlets in the city have established technical data service groups, which are responsible for finding information for readers and helping to solve technical bottlenecks.

In order to familiarize themselves with the production process, understand the needs of production, and closely relate to the workers, the personnel in charge of factory distribution implemented follow-the-shift labor in the factory, and implemented the method of combining labor, propaganda, understanding, and distribution, so that the distribution work was combined with production labor. In the past year, all the factory distribution personnel have followed-the-shift labor for 207 labor days in 12 factories. Through follow-the-shift labor, they often studied technology with the workers and solved many problems in production. For example, distributor Comrade Liu Dexuan once found that Chen Yuzhen, a planing worker at the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant, encountered difficulties in innovating the operation of the planer, so he found her books such as "Expanding the Use of Planers" to help her improve three tools, increasing efficiency by five times. Under the influence and drive of the factory distribution personnel, the distributors of factory and mine bookstores also implemented follow-the-shift labor. This is the road for distributors to be both red and expert, which not only closely serves production, but also establishes a deep relationship with the workers.

Holding book exhibitions and book effect exhibitions is an effective measure to serve production and promote reading. In 1959, we successively held various exhibitions in various factories 23 times, exhibiting more than 28,000 kinds of book materials, with more than 21,000 visitors, and sold more than 24,000 copies of books.

Breaking the Circle of Book Sales Business

Organizing People's Cultural Life

With the in-depth development of the urban people's communization movement, the degree of organization of mass collective production and collective life has been greatly strengthened, and the ideological awareness has also been rapidly improved, and there has been a nationwide upsurge in learning theory, learning culture, and learning technology. The new situation has brought new tasks. We have also stepped out of the circle of distribution business in a timely manner, breaking the "old framework." Under the unified leadership of the Party, in cooperation with relevant departments, we have actively and proactively established more than 60 cultural service organizations in various forms in streets, factories, mines, schools, and larger agency dormitories. These organizations, focusing on the production, learning, and technological revolution of the masses, carried out a variety of convenient cultural service activities combining sales and rentals, including selling books, charging for reading, selling second-hand books on consignment, finding information on consignment, distributing newspapers and periodicals on consignment, and small-scale exhibitions. And around the central task, they carried books and actively went deep into collective activity places such as canteens, street factories, and shopping malls to carry out activities and organize reading. For example, the Jingsan Road Office Cultural Station, in cooperation with the vocational school, established 57 reading and newspaper reading groups, with more than 840 participants; in cooperation with the study of Chairman Mao's works and Chinese Pinyin, it actively delivered books to the door, promoting the learning of the masses. The masses praised: "With the cultural station, reading is really convenient, and helping to read newspapers only costs one cent." This service method has played a great role in promoting production, promoting learning, improving the quality of distribution, regulating the contradiction between supply and demand, and organizing book circulation, making book distribution work a capable assistant for the Party to organize people's cultural life.

Adhere to Politics in Command and Carry out Mass Movements on a Large Scale

Adhering to politics in command and relying on the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous leap forward of our various tasks. Especially since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the struggle between the two roads, the struggle between the two lines, and socialist education have been consistently implemented in various tasks, and the right-leaning tendency has been continuously opposed and efforts have been encouraged. In the movement to increase production and conserve, some people had the mistaken idea that "increasing production and conservation is an old topic, once a year." After discovering this problem, our store leaders, on the one hand, presented the situation and tasks, mobilized the masses, and carried out debates; on the other hand, organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations and research, and criticized the right-leaning ideas with facts, boosted efforts, and promoted the continuous leap forward of work. In 1959, when the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees proposed to carry out the "six competitions" red flag competition movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial front, in order to make book distribution work closely cooperate with the development of this movement, a "six competitions" red flag competition movement centered on serving technological innovation and technological revolution was immediately launched throughout the city. At that time, some comrades thought that "the leap forward has reached the top," or that coordinating technological revolution was a matter for the science and technology outlet and had nothing to do with them. In response to these ideological problems, our store leaders organized special debates, criticized the views of not serving the Party's central work and not serving production, and greatly improved the masses' awareness. It enabled all comrades to establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving politics and serving production, and promoted the leap forward of work.

In order to further improve book distribution work, in the past year, we have organized four tribute-offering movements and seven climaxes of coordinating production around the Party's political movements and production tasks in each period; through grasping typical examples, establishing pacesetters, raising topics, and grasping evaluations, new people and new things have emerged endlessly, and innovative initiatives have blossomed everywhere. Therefore, in 1959, a total of four (times) advanced units, five (times) advanced groups, and eighty (times) advanced workers and pacesetters were selected. Through the red flag competition, 132 major business innovations were made, including the book display quantitative quota management method and the automatic transmission warehouse sales method, many of which have a high level.

Although we have achieved the above-mentioned achievements and experience in our work, it is still far from the requirements of the Party and the Great Leap Forward situation, and these experiences still have some immature and imperfect aspects in some aspects, which need to be further improved and improved. Now, under the correct leadership of the municipal Party and government leading organs, we follow the Party's General Line for socialist construction, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, strive for greater victory, and strive for excellence in book distribution work.

    精益求精地做好图书发行工作
    山东省济南市新华书店代表　杨朝升
    大跃进以来，我们山东济南市新华书店在市党政领导机关的正确领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，遵循着党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，通过图书这一犀利的思想武器，及时地宣传了马克思列宁主义，宣传了毛泽东思想，宣传了党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的无比优越性，宣传了党的各项方针政策，传播了科学、文化知识和各种先进生产经验。发挥了图书发行工作的思想战斗作用，配合和促进了生产、学习、技术革命运动的深入开展。使图书发行工作成为党宣传教育的有力工具和组织人民文化生活的得力助手。
    坚决听党的话　抓住服务中心
    图书发行工作是党的有力宣传工具，必须以党在各个时期的中心工作，为书店的中心任务。自大跃进以来，我们经常关心形势，注意政治动向，紧紧依靠党委和领导机关，了解领导意图和宣传学习任务，一环套一环地为政治、为生产运动服务，从不放过一个可以配合的机会。
    从党的八届六中全会开始，为了宣传党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，配合两条道路的斗争和社会主义教育运动，积极发行了八届六中全会决议、八届八中全会决议、“马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利”、“伟大的十年”、“人民公社万岁”、“马克思主义者应该如何对待革命的群众运动”等书三百七十五万多册，有力地配合了运动的深入开展。
    能否及时配合党的各项政治运动，抓好货源是个重要的关键。没有足够的书籍是不能配合好党的中心任务的。因此，在配合每个运动中，都是抢时间，抓苗头，早抓书、早宣传；一早百早，步步主动。如今年初，根据党关于大力开展毛泽东思想学习运动的指示，我们就提出了“给思想革命送红旗，抓好图书保学习”的口号，一面向市委请示并了解学习毛泽东著作的计划，一面大抓货源。向全国各发货店主动添配毛泽东著作一百一十三万册，保证了急需，争取了主动。由于学习运动来势猛，需要量大，而出版一时跟不上需要，出现了新的供需矛盾。为了促进学习，我们在“有书保证供应，无书也要保证学习”的思想指导下，想出了收换重复多余书籍的办法，一方面动员有“毛泽东选集”和“社会主义教育课程的阅读文件汇编”的同志不再买单行本，把新到的文件供应给最迫切需要的读者；同时又开展了毛主席著作回收工作，把读者重复的存书收回，支援了没有书学习的读者。到2月底已收回二万五千余册，保证了急需，调节了供需矛盾，受到了读者的热烈欢迎，开辟了解决供需矛盾的新途径。自1959年开始，到今年3月止，先后主动配合党的各项政治运动和有关方面的重大工作二百一十多项，供应图书八百二十多万册。都能做到在运动开始前后把书运到，并在两三天内发到读者手里，充分地发挥了图书的思想战斗作用，作到了党委满意，群众满意。
    为工农业生产当参谋  为技术革命配钥匙
    在一切为了高速度、全心全意为生产服务的思想指导下，我们提出了“为工农业生产当参谋，为技术革命配钥匙”的行动口号，调动了一切积极因素。全体同志紧紧地围绕党的生产中心，送书上厂矿、下车间、上工地、到田间，主动为工农业生产服务。
    为了支援工农业生产、高速度地建设社会主义，我们除向领导机关、科学研究部门了解生产安排、发展规划、科学研究项目外，并组织全体职工深入生产，了解生产关键，千方百计地为生产查找和提供资料。如文德机床厂在试制一种新产品时，缺乏一种金属材料，影响生产。我们了解这一情况后，立即协助该厂查找有关资料，经过多方努力，找到了“材料代用”一书，帮助该厂试制获得成功，节约造价三万九千多元，使生产翻了四番。
    去年10月，当我们看到“大众日报”“千方百计服务增产节约，集中兵力突破技术关键”的报导后，立即组成突击小组，掀起了一个深入厂矿、机关、大专院校和科学研究机关了解关键为关键找书，帮助解决关键的高潮。经过三昼夜的苦战，了解到急需解决的技术关键问题一千五百零二件，为读者找到参考资料三千一百五十一本。在一切为了便利读者的思想指导下，我们在书中夹上纸条，说明能解决的关键问题和参考的页码，分别送给读者。在查找资料中，由于大家的科学水平低，对关键问题有的连名词都不懂，但同志们仍是千方百计地查辞典、请教专家。书店没有的资料，就到图书馆去借，本市没有的就转托北京、上海新华书店代办，帮助读者解决了不少的关键问题。如水利科学研究所为解决棉田板结浇水后出现的裂纹现象，急需“棉田灌溉板结层”一书。他们跑遍了全市的书店没有买到，到各图书馆去也没有借到，后来委托书店代办。我们查找了过去的发书纪录，终于在省图书馆找到了这本书，帮助水利科学研究所解决了问题。像这样的事例是很多的。一年多以来，我们发行科技书三百二十六万余册，为生产解决关键问题一千一百八十五个。仅从1959年11月起，就主动了解生产关键问题三千多个，供应资料四千五百多册。为了进一步做好查找资料的工作，全市门市部都成立了技术资料服务小组，担负着为读者查找资料、帮助解决技术关键的任务。
    为了熟悉生产过程，摸清生产需要和密切工人群众的关系，负责工厂发行的人员，在工厂实行了跟班劳动，并且贯彻了边劳动、边宣传、边了解、边发行的方法，使发行工作与生产劳动相结合。一年来全体工厂发行人员，在十二个工厂中，跟班劳动了二百零七个劳动
  日。通过跟班劳动，他们经常和工人一起研究技术，解决了不少生产中的难题。如发行员刘德宣同志，有一次发现济南汽车制造厂刨工陈玉珍在革新刨床操作中遇到了困难，便为她找到了“扩大刨床使用”等书，帮助她改进了三种工具，提高了工效五倍，在工厂发行人员的影响带动下，厂矿书店的发行员，也实行了跟班劳动。这是发行员又红又专的道路，既密切地服务了生产，又和工人群众建立了深厚的感情。
    举办图书展览和书籍效果展览，是服务生产促进读书的有效措施，1959年，我们先后在各工厂举办了各种展览二十三次，展出了图书资料二万八千多种，参观人数达二万一千多人次，销出图书二万四千多册。
        打破卖书业务圈子
    组织人民文化生活
    随着城市人民公社化运动的深入发展，群众集体生产、集体生活的组织程度大大加强，思想觉悟也迅速提高，出现了全民学理论、学文化、学技术的热潮。新形势带来了新任务，我们又及时跳出了发行业务的圈子，打破“旧框框”，在党的统一领导下，协同有关部门，在街道、厂矿、学校和较大的机关宿舍，积极主动地建立了各种形式的文化服务组织六十余处。这些组织，围绕群众的生产、学习、技术革命，以出售、租赁相结合开展了出售图书、收费阅读、代售旧书、代查资料、代发报刊、小型展览等多种便利群众的文化服务活动。并围绕中心任务，携带图书主动深入食堂、街道工厂、商场等集体活动场所开展活动，组织阅读。如经三路办事处文化站，与业校协作，建立了读书读报小组五十七个，参加活动者八百四十余人；配合毛主席著作及汉语拼音学习，主动送书上门，推动了群众的学习。群众赞扬说：“有了文化站，看书真方便，帮助读书报，只花一分钱”。这种服务方式，对促进生产，推动学习，提高发行质量，调节供需矛盾，组织图书流通起了很大作用，使图书发行工作，成为党组织人民文化生活的得力助手。
    坚持政治挂帅　大搞群众运动
    坚持政治挂帅，依靠党的领导，是我们各项工作获得继续跃进的根本保证。特别是党的八届八中全会以来，在各项工作中始终贯彻了两条道路的斗争、两条路线的斗争和社会主义教育，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲。在增产节约运动中，有的人存在着“增产节约是老生常谈，一年一次”的错误思想，我店领导发现这一问题后，一方面摆形势任务，发动群众，开展辩论；另一方面组织力量，深入调查研究，用事实批判了右倾思想，鼓足了干劲，促进工作不断跃进。1959年，当省、市委提出在工业战线上开展以技术革新和技术革命运动为中心的“六比”红旗竞赛运动时，为了使图书发行工作紧密配合这一运动的开展，立即在全市范围内掀起了一个以服务于技术革新和技术革命为中心的“六比”红旗竞赛运动。当时，有些同志认为“跃进到顶了”，或配合技术革命是科技门市部的事，与己无关。我店领导针对这些思想问题，组织了专题辩论，批判了不为党的中心工作服务和不为生产服务的观点，大大提高了群众觉悟。使全店同志树立了全心全意为政治、为生产服务的思想，推动了工作的跃进。
    为了进一步做好图书发行工作，一年来我们围绕党在每个时期的政治运动和生产任务，通过大抓竞赛，组织了四次献礼运动，七个配合生产的高潮；通过抓典型、树标兵、提课题、抓评比，新人新事，层出不穷，革新创举，到处开花。因此1959年共评选出先进单位四个（次），先进小组五个（次）先进工作者、标兵八十人（次）。通过红旗竞赛，革新重大业务一百三十二件，其中书籍陈列定量定额管理法、自动传送库房售书法等多项革新，都具有较高的水平。
    我们在工作中虽然取得了上述的成绩和经验，但离党与大跃进形势的要求，还是很不够的，并且这些经验，在某些方面还有不够成熟和完善的地方，这有待于我们进一步改进和提高。现在，我们在市党政领导机关的正确领导下，遵循着党的社会主义建设的总路线，高举毛泽东思想红旗，再接再厉，乘胜前进，争取更大的胜利，精益求精地做好图书发行工作。
