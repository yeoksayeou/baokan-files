The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, at a representatives' meeting held in Hiroshima on the 10th, passed an emergency declaration expressing opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The declaration announced that it would mobilize all organizations to launch a more vigorous struggle demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and opposition to the US-Japan "Security Treaty".

The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group is attempting to take advantage of Eisenhower's visit to Japan to reorganize the system and forcibly break through the current crisis. Eisenhower's visit to Japan constitutes interference in Japan's internal affairs.

The statement once again demanded that the governments of Japan and the United States immediately cancel Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan, abolish the new "Security Treaty," and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign en masse and dissolve the Diet.

The statement pointed out that if the governments of Japan and the United States ignore this demand, it will further arouse the anger of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: Japanese cultural and educational figures continue to issue statements one after another, strongly demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and opposing US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Thirty-six Japanese labor law scholars issued a statement on the 10th saying that in order to safeguard democracy, there is no other way but to dissolve the Diet.

This statement has been submitted to Kishi Nobusuke and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose.

President Genji Takahashi of Meiji Gakuin University and one hundred and twenty-three faculty and staff members jointly issued a statement on the 10th, strongly demanding the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

Fifty-six professors from five universities, including International Christian University, Tokyo Union Theological Seminary, Aoyama Gakuin University, Meiji Gakuin University, and Tokyo Woman's Christian University, issued an open letter to Eisenhower on the 10th, expressing opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan at this time.

The Japan PEN Club, composed of more than 630 writers, issued a statement on the 10th, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: More than 5,000 young workers and students in Osaka, Japan, held a rally on the evening of the 10th, resolutely opposing US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

The rally passed a resolution expressing its determination to fight to the end to crush the new "Security Treaty" and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The resolution stated that young workers and students in Osaka will strive with all their might to win the victory of the mass rally on June 11th and the second general strike on June 15th.

All participants in the rally held a demonstration on the streets after the meeting.

More than 300 representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and trading companies in the Kansai region of Japan held a rally in Osaka on the 10th, opposing the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and the improvement of Japan-China relations.

The rally passed an emergency resolution demanding the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 10th: Approximately 6,000 people who participated in the demonstration against Eisenhower's visit to Japan today and surrounded his press secretary Hagerty's car held a rally in Ogikubo Park, Tokyo, reaffirming their determination to strengthen the struggle against the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and against US imperialism. The rally was held after Hagerty, frightened and pale from being surrounded, was taken away by a US military helicopter.

Speaking at the rally were representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the "National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty."

Communist Party representative Tsuyoshi Toki pointed out that today's action against Eisenhower's visit to Japan is of great significance in the current struggle against the "Security Treaty." He said: The American imperialists have consistently underestimated the strength of the Japanese people. But today's action clearly showed the American representative how resolutely the Japanese people are defending the dignity of their country. Toki called on the participants to unite more closely and fight to overthrow the Kishi cabinet and prevent Eisenhower from visiting Japan.

Socialist Party member Minoru Tanaka believes that today's protest action was a great success. Because Hagerty had to use a helicopter, he was unable to touch Japanese soil.
