To ensure the expansion of the replanting area, Tianshui and Pingliang Prefectures are preparing enough fertilizer and seeds to ensure that the yield of replanted crops catches up with that of the main crops.

(Our report) Tianshui and Pingliang Prefectures in Gansu Province are making early preparations for replanting, striving to make the yield of replanted crops catch up with that of the main crops.

This year, the replanting area in both prefectures has expanded by 17%-80% compared to last year. Starting in May, both prefectures, in view of the characteristics of concentrated farm work during the replanting period, the strong time sensitivity of replanting, and the large replanting task this year, while actively preparing for the summer harvest and grasping the field management of spring-sown crops, adopted the method of combining top-down and side-by-side arrangement, preparation, inspection, and remedial lessons to fully launch the replanting preparation work. By June 8, the two prefectures had prepared enough seeds, and the planting tools had also been repaired.

All localities are also trying their best to prepare enough high-quality base fertilizer for replanted crops to ensure the quality of replanting. Tianshui Prefecture has prepared more than 50 million dan of various fertilizers for replanting, enough for more than 700,000 mu of land. In order to transport the fertilizer to the fields on time and in sufficient quantities in the case of concentrated farm work, the people's communes have established a large number of smoked fertilizer towers, fertilizer soaking ponds, and fertilizer storage pits on the edges of the land prepared for replanting, which greatly reduced the fertilizer transportation task.

Under the slogan of "Replanting crops to catch up with main crops and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year," the people's communes will expand the planting of high-yield crops, promote fine varieties, and expand intercropping and interplanting in replanting. People's communes in Wenxian, Wudu, Huicheng, and other counties with longer frost-free periods suitable for replanting rice and corn have expanded the area of replanting rice and corn, and promoted fine varieties such as red rice, white-skinned rice, and Baimaya corn.

When arranging the replanting area, the people's communes also made comprehensive arrangements for the crop rotation of next year's crops and guaranteeing the winter wheat sowing area in the second half of the year, according to the heavy cropping of wheat fields and the length of the frost-free period.

### 为扩大复种面积备足肥料种子  天水平凉两专区力争回茬赶正茬

    为扩大复种面积备足肥料种子
    天水平凉两专区力争回茬赶正茬
    本报讯　甘肃省天水、平凉两专区提早进行复种准备工作，力争回茬产量赶上正茬。
    这两个专区今年复种面积都比去年扩大17％—80％。从5月开始，这两个专区就针对复种期间农活集中、复种时间性强和今年复种任务大的特点，在积极准备夏收、抓紧春播作物田间管理的同时，采取上下结合和边安排、边准备、边检查、边补课的方法，全面展开了复种准备工作。到6月8日，这两个专区已备足种子，播种工具也进行了检修。
    各地还千方百计为复种作物准备足够的优质底肥，确保复种质量。天水专区已为复种准备各种肥料五千多万担，足够七十多万亩地用。为了在农活集中的情况下把肥料如时如数运到地里，各人民公社在准备复种的地边，建立了大批的熏肥塔、沤肥池、储肥坑，大大减少了运肥任务。
    在回茬产量赶上正茬，力争今年农业面积大丰收的口号下，各人民公社将在复种中扩种高产作物，推广优良品种、扩大间种套种。无霜期较长、适于复种水稻、玉米的文县、武都、徽成等县的人民公社，扩大了复种水稻和玉米的面积，并推广了红稻、白皮大稻、白马牙玉米等优良品种。
    在安排复种面积时，各人民公社还根据麦田的重茬情况和无霜期的长短，对明年作物的倒茬和保证下半年冬小麦播种面积的问题，都作了全面的安排。（附图片）
