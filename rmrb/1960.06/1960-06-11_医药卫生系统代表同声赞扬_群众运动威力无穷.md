Minister of Health Li Dequan gave a speech at today's meeting entitled "Hold High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and March Towards the Great Goal of Changing Customs and Transforming the World."

After summarizing the leaps and bounds and great achievements made in China's health work since the founding of the country, Li Dequan pointed out that our health cause is a tool to protect people's health and improve the people's health level, and bears the glorious task of changing customs and transforming the world. Health work must closely follow the excellent situation of the continuous leap forward in China's socialist construction, cooperate with the people's commune movement in rural and urban areas, the cultural and technological revolution, continue to deepen the national health movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate major diseases, and realize the tasks of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, thoroughly change our health outlook, and greatly improve the health knowledge level and health level of the Chinese people.

Li Dequan pointed out that in the future, health work must continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, climb the peak of medical science; train health and medical cadres in a fast, good, and economical way; earnestly, deeply, and persistently study Chairman Mao's works, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance from victory to victory.

Finally, Li Dequan encouraged the representatives to continue to resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao in their future work, continue to revolutionize, and raise the red flag higher and higher; to enthusiastically help others catch up with the advanced level, so that there will be no backwardness around the advanced, and when one flag is raised, ten thousand flags will flutter; to always maintain a humble attitude of learning, always maintain the honor of being advanced, and strive for greater achievements.

Next, fourteen representatives spoke at the meeting. They were: Dong Fangzhong, representative of Shanghai Guangci Hospital; Jiang Qinghuai, representative of Shandong Linqing Health School; Wang Yingxian, representative of Jianning County, Fujian Province; Tian Xicheng, representative of the People's Liberation Army 169 Hospital; Yuan Jinduo, representative of Xin'an Commune, Baiyangdian, Xushui County, Hebei Province; Guo Xiuzhen, representative of the Seventeenth Canteen of Gongshui Commune, Mengjin County, Henan Province; Shen Jinbao, leader of schistosomiasis eradication team of Dongfanghong Brigade, Tianning Commune, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province; Cui Zhiyi, representative of Shanghai First Medical College; Jin Wenqi, director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College; Zhu Weiqing, representative of the Red Scarf Small Hospital of Jizhai Primary School, Mian County, Shaanxi Province; Lü Guozhu, representative of Wuhu City Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, Anhui Province; Gao Xing, representative of the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College; Qi Bingyuan, representative of the Cleaning and Management Office of Hupu People's Commune, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province; and Pa Rongkuan, representative of Lujiang Commune, Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province.

The representatives introduced their advanced deeds and achievements in health work in their speeches. They unanimously pointed out that only by holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to the spirit of continuous revolution can we achieve one victory after another. Shanghai Guangci Hospital, which is famous for rescuing Qiu Cai康, is not arrogant or impatient, and is constantly moving forward. In the past two years, it has treated 250 patients with severe burns, with a cure rate of 80.6%, which greatly exceeds the cure rate of capitalist countries. It has also gone to 40 provinces and cities across the country to conduct 61 consultations and rescue operations, and has trained 67 burn specialists and 53 nurses for various places. Jianning County, Fujian Province, used the spirit of continuous revolution to carry out a health movement to eliminate pests and diseases, turning the famous "malaria zone" into a happy paradise. Yangjiawan in this county was a dilapidated mountain village ten years ago with "weeds taller than people and tigers and leopards living in empty houses." Now it is praised as a "new Peach Blossom Garden." The masses praised: "Yangjiawan, happiness is coming, now a disease-free plaque is hung, people and animals are prosperous and production is good, and every household is smiling."

Under the leadership of the Party, vigorously carrying out mass movements is the guarantee for achieving all victories. The representatives once again praised the power of mass movements in their speeches.

Xin'an Commune in Baiyangdian, Xushui County, Hebei Province, vigorously carried out mass movements, mobilized more than 40,000 people in the commune, and established various assault teams of men, women, old and young. Everyone contributed ideas, everyone contributed treasures, used both indigenous and foreign methods, and showed their abilities. They created more than 300 ways to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and launched a large-scale offensive against mosquitoes and flies. Now they have basically eliminated mosquitoes, turning the "mosquito world" into a happy mosquito-free water town. Wuhu City, Anhui Province, vigorously launched a mass movement to prevent and treat trachoma, trained 1,400 activists to master operating techniques, and adopted the method of conducting general surveys, training, treatment, and prevention at the same time. By the end of March, 320,000 people had been surveyed out of the city's population of 380,000, of which 230,000 trachoma patients had all been cured, and efforts are being made to eliminate trachoma this year.

    医药卫生系统代表同声赞扬
    群众运动威力无穷
    新华社10日讯　全国文教先进工作者代表大会医药卫生系统的会议，从今天起开始举行。
    卫生部部长李德全在今天的会上以“高举毛泽东思想旗帜，向移风易俗改造世界的伟大目标迈进”为题讲了话。
    李德全在概括叙述了建国以来我国卫生工作获得的飞跃发展和巨大成绩之后指出，我们的卫生事业，是保护人民健康，提高人民健康水平的工具，肩负着移风易俗、改造世界的光荣任务。卫生工作必须紧紧跟上我国社会主义建设持续跃进的大好形势，配合乡村和城市的人民公社化运动、文化技术大革命，继续深入开展全民性的除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的卫生运动，提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务，彻底改变我们的卫生面貌，大大提高我国人民的卫生知识水平和健康水平。
    李德全指出，今后卫生工作必须继续大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命，攀登医学科学高峰；多快好省地培养卫生医药干部；认真、深入、顽强地学习毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想红旗，从胜利走向胜利。
    李德全最后勉励代表们今后在工作中要继续坚决听党和毛主席的话，不断革命，把红旗越举越高；要满腔热情地帮助别人赶上先进水平，做到先进身边无落后，一旗升起万旗飘；要永远保持谦虚学习的态度，永远保持先进的荣誉，争取更大的成绩。
    接着，有十四位代表在会上发言。他们是：上海广慈医院代表董方中，山东临清卫生学校代表蒋清淮，福建省建宁县代表王英贤，人民解放军一六九医院代表田希成，河北省徐水县白洋淀新安公社代表苑金铎，河南省孟津县拱水公社十七食堂代表郭秀珍，浙江省嘉兴县天凝公社东方红大队灭螺队长沈金宝，上海第一医学院代表崔之义，武汉医学院第二附属医院妇产科主任金问淇，陕西省沔县纪宅小学红领巾小医院代表朱维庆，安徽省芜湖市眼病防治所代表吕国珠，北京医学院第一附属医院代表高兴，江苏省常熟县浒浦人民公社清洁管理所代表齐炳元，云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州保山县潞江公社代表帕荣宽。
    代表们在发言中介绍了他们的先进事迹和卫生工作方面的成绩。他们一致指出，由于高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持不断革命的精神，才取得了一个接着一个的胜利。以抢救丘财康而闻名的上海广慈医院戒骄戒躁，不断前进，两年来又治疗了严重烧灼伤病员二百五十名，治愈率达80．6％，大大超越了资本主义国家治愈率的水平。并且外出到全国四十个省市进行六十一次会诊抢救工作，为各地培养烧伤专业医师六十七名、护士五十三名。福建省建宁县用不断革命的精神开展除害灭病运动，把著名的“瘴疠之区”变成幸福乐园。这个县的杨家湾十年前是“野草高过人、空屋虎豹栖”的破落山村，如今得到“新桃花园”的赞誉，群众歌颂道：“杨家湾，幸福来，如今挂了免病牌，人畜两旺生产好，家家户户笑颜开。”
    在党的领导下大搞群众运动是取得一切胜利的保证，代表们在发言中再一次赞扬了群众运动的威力。
    河北省徐水县白洋淀新安公社大搞群众运动，发动全社四万多人，成立男女老少各种突击队，人人献计，个个献宝，土洋并举，各显其能，创造消灭蚊蝇方法三百多种，向蚊蝇大举进攻，现在已经基本消灭了蚊子，使“蚊子世界”变成幸福无蚊的水乡。安徽省芜湖市大搞防治沙眼的群众运动，训练一千四百名积极分子，掌握操作技术，并且采取边普查、边训练、边治、边防的办法，至3月下旬，在全市三十八万人口中普查了三十二万人，其中沙眼患者达二十三万人均全部治愈，今年内争取消灭沙眼。
    会议明天上午将继续举行。
