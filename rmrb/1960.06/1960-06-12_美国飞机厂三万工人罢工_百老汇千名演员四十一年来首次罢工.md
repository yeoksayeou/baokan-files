Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to TASS, New York: On June 9th, workers at seven aircraft factories of the "United Aircraft Corporation" in Connecticut, USA, held a large-scale strike. According to preliminary statistics, 33,000 people participated in the strike.

The strike broke out because the factory owners refused to meet the workers' demands for higher wages, the right for workers to express opinions to the factory, and the capitalist guarantee not to lay off workers.

Newspapers reported that the authorities used various methods to disrupt the workers' picket lines, resulting in conflicts between the workers' pickets and the police, and many workers were arrested. In order to put pressure on the strikers, the company has requested the local court to issue an order prohibiting the activities of the workers' picket lines.

From June 2nd to 10th, the thousands of actors in Broadway, New York, the famous theater center in the US, held their first strike in forty-one years. After nine days of struggle, they have forced the Broadway theater owners to agree to increase actors' wages and pensions. This actors' strike was conducted under the leadership of the New York Actors' Equity Association. The union demanded that the League of New York Theatres, which represents the Broadway theater owners, raise the minimum wage and pensions for actors.

The strike began on the evening of June 2nd. On the bustling Broadway in New York, the curtains of twenty-two theaters had to be lowered. Inside and outside the theaters were silent and deserted. This noisiest and brightest area of New York at night fell into darkness.

With the actors on strike, the theaters had to close, and nearby restaurants, cafes, and hotels also saw a decline in business. This strike dealt a great blow to theater owners and show promoters.

During the strike, the participating actors were united and received sympathy and support from people in the theater industry. As a result, they defeated the capitalists' conspiracy to undermine the strike.

After nine days of struggle, the League of New York Theatres had to agree to increase the actors' minimum wage by 7% and increase pensions.

    美国飞机厂三万工人罢工
    百老汇千名演员四十一年来首次罢工
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：在美国康?狄格州“联合飞机公司”七个飞机工厂的工人9日举行了大罢工。据初步统计，参加这次罢工的有三万三千人。
    爆发罢工是由于工厂老板拒绝满足工人的下述要求：提高工资，工人有权对厂方提出意见，资本家应保证不再解雇工人。
    据报纸报道，当局采用了种种办法来破坏工人纠察线，结果工人纠察队同警察发生了冲突，许多工人被逮捕。公司方面为了对罢工者施压力，已经要求地方法院下令禁止工人纠察队的活动。
    美国纽约著名戏剧中心——百老汇的上千名演员从6月2日到10日举行了四十一年来的第一次罢工，经过九天的斗争已经迫使百老汇的剧院老板答应增加演员工资和养老金。这次演员的罢工是在纽约演员协会联合会领导下进行的。联合会要求代表百老汇剧院老板的纽约剧院主联盟提高演员的最低工资和养老金。
    罢工在6月2日晚上开始。纽约繁华的百老汇大街上，二十二家戏院的舞台上不得不低垂着帷幕。剧院内外沉沉寂寂。这个纽约夜间最喧杂明亮的地区陷于一片黑暗。
    演员罢工，剧场只得关闭，附近饭馆、咖啡馆、酒店也都随着门前冷落车马稀少。这次罢工给了剧院老板和演出商很大打击。
    在罢工过程中，参加罢工的演员团结一致，并且得到了戏剧界人士的同情和支持。结果击败了资本家企图破坏罢工的阴谋。
    经过九天的斗争，纽约剧院主联盟只得同意把演员的最低工资提高7％，并增加养老金。
