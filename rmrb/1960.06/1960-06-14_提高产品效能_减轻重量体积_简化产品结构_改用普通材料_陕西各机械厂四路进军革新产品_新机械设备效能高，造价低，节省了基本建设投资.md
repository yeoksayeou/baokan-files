Xi'an, June 13th (This newspaper dispatch) – Many machinery manufacturing factories in Shaanxi Province have put forward the slogan of "Four Transformations" to vigorously carry out product revolution and provide more advanced and economical technical equipment for socialist construction. The specific content of the "Four Transformations" is: product efficiency changes from low to high, volume changes from heavy and large to small and light, product structure changes from complex to simple, and materials change from precious materials to ordinary materials.

In terms of improving product efficiency, the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory has made three major reforms to the structure of a certain phase-shifting capacitor, with the same volume and no increase in materials, while the single-unit capacity has increased by 30%. This item alone can increase the value of production for the country by two million yuan this year. In terms of reducing product weight and volume, the Baoji Petroleum Machinery Factory's newly produced deep well pumping unit weighs only a little over one ton, which is nine tons lighter than the original product with the same efficiency. This not only saves steel and manufacturing man-hours, but also brings convenience to oil workers for mobile installation. In terms of simplifying product structure and making parts standardized, universal, and serialized, the Baoji Engineering Machinery Factory simplified the structure of various diesel engines and unified them into a series, saving half of the production man-hours. The new bottomless mine car produced by Xi'an Mining Machinery Factory eliminated the bumpers and beams on general mine cars, saving one ton of steel and over a hundred man-hours for every seven cars. Many factories also replace precious materials with ordinary materials while ensuring production efficiency. The Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory replaced the copper guide rod on the capacitor porcelain bottle with an iron one, because the cross-section of the guide rod is large and the current passing through is small, which does not affect the product performance, but saves a lot of copper.

The reformed mechanical equipment, because of its improved efficiency, reduced cost, and better performance, has brought many benefits to industrial construction. The Northwest Industrial Construction Design Institute recently used the innovated mechanical equipment to equip some industrial ceramic factories. The general cost is one-half to one-third lower than that of using old-fashioned mechanical equipment, but the output is one to two times higher, and the degree of mechanization is also much higher. The construction area of some factories and workshops can also be reduced. This can save basic construction investment and better exert the effect of investment.

In the product revolution, Shaanxi's machinery factories vigorously launched mass movements and generally adopted the "three-way combination" method of leading cadres, designers, and production workers. At the beginning of this year, the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory launched a technical data rectification campaign, mobilizing the broad masses of workers to offer opinions on product design. On average, each worker in the factory made more than ten innovation suggestions, so that all kinds of products have been improved. Many factories also vigorously promoted the "three-way combination" outside the factory, organizing users, designers, and producers to jointly innovate product design. The Party Secretary of Baoji Petroleum Machinery Factory led a working group with designers and manufacturing workers to solicit opinions from workers and technicians at petroleum machinery user units, and jointly improve product design with the workers of the user units, with great results.

    提高产品效能　减轻重量体积　简化产品结构　改用普通材料
    陕西各机械厂四路进军革新产品
    新机械设备效能高，造价低，节省了基本建设投资
    本报西安13日电　陕西省许多机械制造工厂提出“四变”的口号，大搞产品革命，为社会主义建设提供更先进更经济的技术装备。“四变”的具体内容是：产品效能由低变高，体积由重而大变小而轻，产品结构由复杂变简单，材料由贵重材料变普通材料。
    在提高产品效能方面，西安电力电容器厂对一种移相电容器的结构作了三次重大改革，体积不变，材料没有增加，而单台容量提高了30％。仅此一项，今年就可以为国家增产价值二百万元。在减轻产品重量和缩小产品体积方面，宝鸡石油机械一厂新生产的一种深井抽油机，只有一吨多重，比原来同样效能的产品减轻了九吨。这样不仅节约了钢材和制造工时，还为石油工人流动安装带来了便利。在简化产品结构，使零件标准化、通用化和系列化方面，宝鸡工程机械厂把各种柴油机的结构简化并统一为一个序列以后，生产工时节约了一半。西安矿山机械厂新生产的无底架矿车，取消了一般矿车上的碰头和大梁，每七辆就节省一吨钢材，百多个工时。许多厂还在保证生产效能的前提下，以普通材料代替贵重材料。西安电力电容器厂把电容器磁瓶上的铜导杆换成铁的，因为导杆断面很大而通过的电流很小，并不影响产品性能，却可节约大量的铜。
    经过改革的机械设备，因为效能提高，造价降低，性能更好，就为工业建设带来了很多好处。西北工业建筑设计院最近用经过革新的机械装备起来的一些工业陶瓷厂，一般造价比用旧式机械装备的低二分之一到三分之一，但是生产量却高出一两倍，机械化程度也高得多。有的工厂、车间建筑面积也可以缩减。这都可以节省基本建设投资，更好地发挥投资效果。
    陕西各机械厂在产品革命中，大搞群众运动，普遍采取领导干部，设计人员和生产工人“三结合”的方法。西安电力电容器厂在今年初就展开技术资料整顿运动，发动广大职工对产品设计提意见。全厂每个工人提的革新建议平均达十条以上，作到了种种产品都有改进。许多厂还大搞厂外“三结合”，组织使用者、设计者、生产者共同革新产品设计。宝鸡石油机械一厂党委书记带领有设计人员和制造工人参加的工作组，到石油机械使用单位征求工人和技术人员的意见，和使用单位的职工共同改进产品设计，收效很大。
