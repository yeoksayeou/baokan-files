Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: World Federation of Trade Unions Vice-President and Latin American Labor Alliance President Vicente Lombardo Toledano (Mexico) spoke at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the afternoon of June 6th.

Toledano said that due to time constraints, this meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council cannot collectively and deeply study the issues brought about by various international situations. However, it is possible to draw conclusions on some of the main issues. The most important issue at this moment is the issue of peace. He said that the forces supporting peace are much stronger than the forces of war. This fact should be the starting point for studying all conflict issues. It should also be the starting point for deciding the tactics and strategies of the working class represented by the World Federation of Trade Unions.

He continued: International imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, creates obstacles and undermines the peaceful resolution of various outstanding issues. This clearly proves that imperialism has no valid reason to oppose disarmament and the peaceful resolution of various outstanding issues. They adopt such an attitude not because they feel powerful, but because they feel powerless in the face of the powerful forces striving for peace, disarmament, and peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism. Therefore, our responsibility is to make every effort to mobilize the working class and the masses to expose imperialism, expose their conspiracies, and isolate them among the democratic forces of the world.

He emphasized: For us Latin American people, U.S. imperialism is currently the main enemy of our normal and independent development. In all aspects of our national life, it is always the enemy of our independent and autonomous development. The methods and language used by U.S. imperialism in various stages of expansion to achieve its unchanging goals are well known to the Latin American working class and democratic strata. The people of Latin American countries have more than a century of valuable experience regarding the purposes of imperialism and the various methods it uses to achieve its purposes.

He said that in the beginning, in the first half of the nineteenth century, their theory was that the United States had a "civilizing mission" to rule the people of the American continent. Later, they put forward the theory of Pan-Americanism and the Monroe Doctrine, to separate the people of Latin America from the rest of the world. After the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism openly said that the twentieth century was "the American century." Now they are propagating that the twenty countries of Latin America are “partners” in the joint development of South America by the United States. He revealed that U.S. imperialism has exhausted all means, and even created new phrases, to make the Latin American people believe in its goodwill. However, the facts are here: they have nine billion U.S. dollars of investment in Latin America, while the masses of people in our countries are becoming increasingly impoverished. The so-called "aid" and "help" that the United States provides to Latin American countries is only to undermine the development of these countries' national economies, to seize huge profits from the vast land of Latin America, to prevent the Latin American people from using their natural resources to promote their independent progress, to hinder the independent industrialization of these countries, and to stop the expansion of our nascent democratic systems.

He said: We cannot imagine that U.S. imperialism will automatically change its consciousness, because imperialism is a force for economic expansion into backward countries. It is striving to pursue maximum profits. It illegally interferes in the internal affairs of weak countries. It often ideologically corrodes many social strata in backward countries. We cannot believe that imperialism can be easily guided towards constructive goals. We cannot believe that imperialism can be made to use the resources it uses today to prepare for war to help the people of the weak countries under its control and cruelly exploited by it.

Finally, Toledano proposed a suggestion to entrust the World Federation of Trade Unions Secretariat to study the relationship between underdeveloped countries and relatively developed capitalist countries.

    世界工联副主席托列达诺发言强调
    不能幻想美帝国主义改变它的意识
    必须尽力动员人民揭露美帝国主义；拉丁美洲人民深知美帝国主义是他们的主要敌人，深知美帝国主义为了达到它永远不变的目的采用了各种手法；它对拉丁美洲国家的所谓“援助”，破坏了这些国家民族经济的发展；不能相信帝国主义把它用于备战的资源用来帮助受它残酷剥削的弱小国家的人民。
    新华社7日讯　世界工会联合会副主席、拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席维森特·伦巴多·托列达诺（墨西哥）6日下午在世界工联理事会会议上发言。
    托列达诺说，世界工联理事会这次开会，由于时间的关系，不可能集体地深入地研究各种国际局势所带来的问题。但是，对于主要的一些问题是可能得出结论的。这个时刻最主要的问题是和平问题。他说，拥护和平的力量已比战争力量要强得多。这个事实应该是研究所有冲突问题的出发点。也应该是作为决定世界工联所代表的工人阶级的策略与战略的路线的出发点。
    他接着说：以美国帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义制造障碍，破坏各种悬而未决的问题的和平解决，这就很明显地证明，帝国主义没有站得住脚的理由来反对裁军和反对各种悬而未决的问题的和平解决。它们采取这样的态度并不是由于它们感到自己的强大，而是由于在争取和平、裁军、社会主义与资本主义之间和平竞赛的强大力量之前，它们感到无能为力。因此，我们的责任是尽一切努力来动员工人阶级和人民群众去揭露帝国主义，戳穿他们的阴谋，使他们在世界上的民主力量之间孤立起来。
    他强调说：对于我们拉丁美洲人民说来，美帝国主义是现在我们的正常与独立的发展的主要敌人。在我们民族生活的各方面，它永远是我们独立自主发展的敌人。美国帝国主义在各个扩张阶段为了达到永远不变的目的而使用的方法和语言，是拉丁美洲工人阶级和民主阶层所熟知的。对于帝国主义的目的以及它为达到目的而采用的各种手法，拉丁美洲各国人民有一个世纪以上的经验，这经验是很有价值的。
    他说，在最初，即在十九世纪上半叶，他们的理论是美国负有“开化使命”来统治美洲大陆的人民。以后，他们提出的理论是泛美联盟和门罗主义，以此把拉丁美洲人民与世界其他地区分割开来。第二次世界大战结束之后，美帝国主义公然说，二十世纪是“美国的世纪”。现在他们宣传拉丁美洲二十个国家是美国共同开发南美洲的“伙伴”。他揭露说：美帝国主义用尽了各种方式，甚至创造了各种新的词句要拉丁美洲人民相信它的善意。但是，事实摆在这里：他们在拉丁美洲有九十亿美元的投资，而我们这些国家的人民群众却日益贫困。美国对拉丁美洲国家的所谓“援助”和“帮助”，只不过是为了破坏这些国家民族经济的发展，从拉丁美洲广大的土地上夺走巨额的利润，为了使拉丁美洲人民不能利用自己的天然资源来推进他们独立的进步，妨碍这些国家独立的工业化，制止我们刚开始的民主制度的扩大。
    他说：我们不能幻想美帝国主义自动地改变它的意识，因为帝国主义是向落后国家进行经济扩张的力量。它在竭力追求最大限度的利润。它非法地干涉弱小国家的内政。它经常从思想上侵蚀落后国家的许多社会阶层。我们不能相信能够轻易地把帝国主义导向建设性的目标。不能相信能使帝国主义把它今天用于准备战争的资源用来帮助在它控制之下和受它残酷剥削的弱小国家的人民。
    托列达诺最后提出一个建议，把不发达国家与相当发达的资本主义国家的关系问题交给世界工联书记处研究。
