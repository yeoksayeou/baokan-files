Guangdong Rural Cadres Learn from Ye Yang to Improve Their Work Style
Comrade Ye Yang has lived, eaten, and labored with the masses for ten years as one of them, without any special treatment or airs.
Vast numbers of cadres in Dianbai, Nanxiong, Huiyang, and Hua Counties take Comrade Ye Yang as their model to strengthen their flesh-and-blood ties with the masses.
This newspaper reports that Comrade Ye Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary of Shishui Brigade, Diancheng Commune, Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, has persisted in eating, living, and laboring with the masses, going deep into production and among the masses, and has excellently completed all his work tasks, being continuously assessed as a model cadre for ten years. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions, calling on all rural Party members and cadres to learn from Comrade Ye Yang's fine qualities and working style.

In its instructions, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stated that Comrade Ye Yang, Party General Branch Secretary of Shishui Brigade, Diancheng Commune, Dianbai County, is a good Party member and model cadre, setting a good example for cadres at all levels of communes throughout the province. There are many aspects of Comrade Ye Yang's working style that are worth learning, the main ones being: he is diligent and thorough, persisting in "three togethers" (eating, living, and laboring together) with the masses for ten years, consulting with the masses on all matters; he adheres to the Party's line, principles, and policies, resisting and overcoming unhealthy tendencies; he leads by example in everything, influencing and educating the masses with his own model actions, and driving the masses forward; he proceeds from the fundamental interests of the people, caring for the masses meticulously, and regarding the difficulties of the masses as his own; he bears hardship first and enjoys comfort later, adhering to and carrying forward the fine tradition of hard work and plain living. It should be particularly mentioned here that Comrade Ye Yang's ten-year persistence in "three togethers" is even more commendable. The "three togethers" is a fine tradition we created in the land reform and cooperativization movements, and it played a significant positive role in practical work. However, in recent times, some people have relaxed in this regard; some believe that the "three togethers" was necessary for carrying out social reform movements, but it is not necessary for production movements now. This view is incorrect. Cadres at all levels must appear as ordinary laborers and must establish an equal, comradely relationship with the masses; that is to say, they must be like Comrade Ye Yang, without any special treatment or airs. If our cadres can do this, then the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people can be more fully stimulated, and the infinite superiority of the people's communes can be more prominently displayed. In this way, all the difficulties in our path of progress will be overcome, our socialist construction will be accelerated, and the communist ideal can be smoothly realized. It is hoped that all rural cadres in the province will take Comrade Ye Yang as a model, further improve their work style, continuously improve their ideological level and working ability, and complete all tasks more outstandingly.

This newspaper reports, according to the Southern Daily: The movement to "Learn from Ye Yang, catch up with Ye Yang, and surpass Ye Yang" has rapidly unfolded in Dianbai, Nanxiong, Huiyang, Hua County and other counties in Guangdong Province. Vast numbers of cadres have resolutely responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call, improving their work style with great speed and efficiency, and have already achieved results.

In Dianbai County, where Comrade Ye Yang works, more than 10,000 Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres are going deep into production, deep among the masses, and persisting in the "three togethers." All five county Party secretaries and twenty commune Party first secretaries have brought their bedding to the brigades to "three together" with the commune members. They took off their shoes and socks and labored together with the commune members, and many cadres truly mingled with the commune members. The commune members reflected: The cadres from the land reform era are back, and we are more enthusiastic about production. Cadres who rarely participated in labor in the past immediately participated in labor after learning about Ye Yang's deeds, leading production in production. For example, in Shanlan Brigade, Qijing Commune, six brigade cadres rarely participated in production in the past, and the commune members called them "half-day hanging" cadres. After they learned about Ye Yang's deeds, everyone unanimously stated: "What Ye Yang can do, we can definitely do too." And they immediately went to various teams to "three together" with the commune members. In the past half month, the six cadres in this brigade averaged ninety work points each. After learning about Ye Yang's deeds, many cadres throughout the county have initially achieved "two-izations" and "two-haves," namely: making life close to the masses, making labor regular; having tools for labor, and having a small notebook for recording work points. In the movement to learn from Ye Yang, catch up with Ye Yang, and surpass Ye Yang in Dianbai County, cadres are paying more attention to the lives of the masses. They not only eat with the commune members, but also try every means to run the canteens well.

Since the launch of the movement to learn from Ye Yang in Nanxiong County, more than 11,000 cadres and masses have been eating, living, laboring, and consulting together. County and commune-level leading cadres have gone out of their offices and gone deep into backward areas to help carry out work, and vast numbers of cadres have also gone deep into the fields and canteens, taking the lead in production and working as cooks. At present, all twenty-three members of the county Party committee, except for two who are staying at home to handle daily work, have gone to the communes and brigades, and all forty-three commune Party secretaries in the county have also gone to backward teams to help improve work. The "three togethers" of cadres and commune members has further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. The county's early rice originally had more than 400,000 mu of type three seedlings. After the cadres led the masses to carry out rescue efforts, the growth momentum of more than 110,000 mu has improved.

The Huiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolutely responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call, improving its work style with great speed and efficiency, and going out of the office to go deep into the grassroots. At the same time, the county Party committee called on all cadres in the county to learn from model Party member and model cadre Ye Yang. At present, among the nine secretaries of the county Party committee, except for one who is staying at the county Party committee to handle daily work, the remaining eight secretaries and all members of the county Party committee have been stationed in communes and brigades, and the county Party committee office has also moved to Chenghai Brigade, Tonghu Commune, to work. All departments of the county Party committee, except for the United Front Work Department, have all moved out of their offices and have been stationed in various communes. More than 21,000 cadres at all four levels in the county have been eating, living, and laboring together with the commune members. Because cadres have gone deep among the masses and deep into production, strengthening specific leadership, initial results have been achieved. Two responsible comrades of the county Party committee were stationed in the backward Aibei and Dalan Brigades in Hengli Commune. They ate together with the commune members in the canteen and learned through laboring and talking with the commune members that the reason why the lives of these two brigades were not arranged well enough was that the cadres still did not pay enough attention to the lives of the masses after going deep down, so they immediately helped the brigade cadres to properly arrange the lives of the commune members. Because the leaders of the county Party committee took the lead in going deep down and appearing as ordinary laborers everywhere, coupled with the launch of the movement to learn from Ye Yang, a trend has begun to form among the vast numbers of cadres throughout the county to go deep into the grassroots.

On May 30th, after the Hua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party saw the report on Ye Yang's model deeds and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee in the Southern Daily, it immediately made a decision, calling on all cadres in the county to learn from Ye Yang's model deeds. And it stipulated that in the learning process, everyone should use Comrade Ye Yang as a mirror to systematically examine themselves, formulate a plan to improve their work style, and earnestly achieve learning, doing, and correcting at the same time. After the county Party committee made its decision, it quickly launched a wave of learning from Ye Yang throughout the county. After reading the newspaper, the thirty-four production team leaders and above cadres of Jiutan Brigade, Xinhua Commune, were all moved by Comrade Ye Yang's model deeds. They immediately formulated measures to improve their work style and implemented them.

In Guangdong, the movement to learn from Ye Yang has expanded to the industrial front. For example, after the cadres on the industrial and transportation front in Bao'an County and communes launched the movement to learn from Ye Yang, they went out of their offices and went deep into factories and mines. All four ministers, seven bureau directors, thirty factory and mine branch secretaries and factory directors, nine commune industrial secretaries, and twelve industrial ministers in the county also brought their bedding to the factories to "three together" with the workers.

    坚持以普通劳动者的姿态同群众一起劳动一起生活
    广东农村干部学习叶养改进作风
    叶养同志十年如一日地和群众同吃同住同劳动没有半点特殊没有半点架子
    电白，南雄，惠阳，花县广大干部以叶养同志为榜样密切同群众的血肉联系
    本报讯　广东省电白县电城公社湿水大队党总支书记叶养同志，十年如一日地坚持与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，深入生产，深入群众，出色地完成了各项工作任务，连续十年被评为模范干部。最近，中共广东省委发出指示，号召农村全体党员和干部学习叶养同志的优良品质和工作作风。
    中共广东省委在指示中说，电白县电城公社湿水大队党总支书记叶养同志是一个好党员和模范干部，为全省公社各级干部做出了一个好榜样。叶养同志的工作作风有许多值得学习的地方，主要的是：他艰苦深入，十年如一日坚持不懈地与群众“三同”，遇事同群众商量；他坚持党的路线、方针、政策，顶住歪风，战胜歪风；他事事以身作则，用自己的模范行动影响和教育群众，带动群众前进；他一切从人民群众的根本利益出发，无微不至地关心群众，把群众的困难看成是自己的困难；他吃苦在前，享乐在后，坚持和发扬艰苦朴素的优良作风。在这里，要特别提到的是，叶养同志十年如一日地坚持“三同”，更加难能可贵。“三同”，是我们在土改和合作化运动中创立的优良作风，在实际工作中起了极大的积极作用。但是，在最近一个时期，有些人对此有些放松了；有人认为搞社会改革运动需要实行“三同”，现在搞生产运动就没有那种必要了。这种看法是不对的。我们各级干部都必须以普通劳动者的姿态出现，都必须同群众建立一种平等的同志式的关系；也就是说，必须像叶养同志那样，没有半点特殊，没有半点架子。我们的干部能这样办到了，那么，人民群众的革命干劲就能更加充分地激发起来，人民公社的无限优越性就能更加显著地发挥出来。这样，我们前进途中的一切困难都只会被克服，我们的社会主义建设就能加快，共产主义的理想就能顺利地实现。希望全省农村干部都以叶养同志为榜样，进一步改善工作作风，不断地提高觉悟水平和工作能力，更加出色地完成各项任务。
    本报讯　据南方日报消息：“学叶养、赶叶养、超叶养”的运动已经在广东省电白、南雄、惠阳、花县等县迅速展开，广大干部坚决响应省委号召，雷厉风行地改进工作作风，并且已经收到成效。
    在叶养同志工作的地方——电白县，一万多名党团员和干部，深入生产，深入群众，坚持“三同”。全县五个县委书记、二十个公社党委第一书记都已携带铺盖搬到大队去和社员“三同”。他们脱下了鞋袜，和社员一起劳动，许多干部跟社员真正打成了一片。社员们反映：土改时的干部又回来了，我们搞生产也更带劲了。过去很少参加劳动的干部，在学习叶养事迹以后，马上参加劳动，在生产中领导生产。如七径公社山岚大队有六个大队干部，过去都很少参加生产，社员称他们是“半天吊”干部。他们学习叶养事迹以后，大家一致表示：“叶养能办到的，我们也一定能办到。”并且立即分头到各个小队和社员“三同”去了。近半个月来，这个大队的六个干部平均每人做了九十个劳动工分。全县不少干部在学习叶养事迹以后，已经初步做到“两化”、“两有”，即：生活群众化，劳动经常化；劳动有工具，记工有手折。电白县干部在学叶养、赶叶养、超叶养的运动中，更加关心群众生活。他们不但跟社员一块儿吃饭，而且千方百计地办好食堂。
    南雄县开展学习叶养的运动以来，已有一万一千多名干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。县、社两级领导干部纷纷走出办公室，深入到落后地区帮助开展工作，广大干部也纷纷深入田间，深入食堂，带头生产，下厨当炊事员。目前，县委二十三个委员除了两个留家处理日常工作以外，其余都已下到公社和大队，全县四十三个公社党委书记也已全部住到落后队去，帮助改进工作。干部与社员“三同”，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，鼓舞了群众的干劲。全县早造原有三类禾四十万多亩，经过干部领导群众进行抢救，现在有十一万多亩的生势已经好转。
    中共惠阳县委会坚决响应省委号召，雷厉风行改进工作作风，走出办公室深入基层。与此同时，县委号召全县干部向模范党员、模范干部叶养学习。目前，县委九个书记当中，除留下一个在县委会处理日常工作以外，其余八个书记和全部县委委员，都驻到公社、大队去，县委办公室也搬到潼湖公社澄海大队办公。县委的各部室，除统战部以外，都一律搬出办公室，分别驻到各公社去。全县四级干部已有二万一千多人和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。由于干部深入群众，深入生产，加强具体领导，已经收到初步效果。县委两个负责同志驻到横沥公社落后的矮陂和大岚大队，在食堂和社员一起吃饭，又通过和社员同劳动、谈心，很快了解到这两个大队生活安排得不够好的原因，是干部深入下去后，仍然对群众生活重视不够，于是立即帮助大队干部妥善安排好社员生活。由于县委领导带头深入，处处以普通劳动者身份出现，加上开展了学叶养的运动，全县广大干部深入基层已开始形成风尚。
    5月30日，中共花县县委看到南方日报刊登的叶养的模范事迹和省委的指示以后，立即作出决定，号召全县干部学习叶养的模范事迹。并规定在学习过程中，都要以叶养同志为镜子，系统地检查自己，订出改进作风的计划，切实做到边学、边做、边改。县委决定以后，很快便在全县掀起了一个学习叶养的热潮。新华公社九潭大队三十四个生产队长以上干部，在阅读报纸以后，都被叶养同志的模范事迹所感动。他们立即订出了改进工作作风的措施，并且贯彻执行。
    在广东，学习叶养的运动已扩展到工业战线。如宝安县和公社的工业交通战线干部，开展学叶养运动以后，纷纷走出办公室，深入厂矿。全县四个部长，七个局长，三十个厂矿支部书记和厂长，九个公社工业书记和十二个工业部长，也都携带铺盖搬到工厂去与工人“三同”。
