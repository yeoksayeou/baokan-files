Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: The Sixth National Congress of the Japanese Democratic Youth League opened in Tokyo today.

Three hundred delegates from all over Japan are participating in this congress, which will discuss the league's current policy direction and clarify its basic nature. This three-day congress is being held under the slogan: "Let us increase our members to 300,000 and our cadres to 10,000."

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party passed a resolution on expanding and strengthening the Democratic Youth League at its Ninth Extraordinary Plenary Session held in March this year.

A spokesman for the Democratic Youth League told reporters that the league's membership has tripled in the past three years and branches of the league have been established in all prefectures.

The spokesman emphasized that "In order to adapt to the development of the situation, it is urgently necessary to increase the membership of the league to 300,000. Judging from the achievements made so far, this is not impossible."

He also said, "The basic task of the Sixth Congress is to formulate policies to coordinate the mass character of the league with the spirit of class struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League sent a telegram to the Sixth Congress of the Japanese Democratic Youth League on the 24th, warmly congratulating the convening of the congress.

The telegram said that since its establishment, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Democratic Youth League has inherited the glorious tradition of the Japanese revolutionary youth movement, held high the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, united the broad masses of Japanese youth in an unremitting struggle for independence, democracy, peace and neutrality, and for youth rights and social progress. In recent years, the Japanese Democratic Youth League has mobilized the broad masses of youth and the people to carry out a vigorous struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, and to oppose the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to create "two Chinas," making important contributions to safeguarding the national interests of Japan and the vital rights of youth, and to defending peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese youth fully support your just struggle and are elated by the victories you have achieved.

The telegram said that the brave and tenacious struggle of the Japanese people and youth has successfully shattered the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism chieftain Eisenhower to "visit" Japan, and forced the traitor Nobusuke Kishi to shamefully announce his resignation. This is a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The new victory of the Japanese people once again proves that in the face of the powerful strength of the people, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are all paper tigers. As long as the people and youth strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries can be defeated.

The telegram pointed out that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' imposition of the "exchange" of U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty "instruments of ratification" on the Japanese people is a last-ditch struggle after the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have suffered a series of heavy blows. This can only arouse greater anger among the Japanese people and youth, prompting the Japanese people and youth to make persistent efforts, press ahead in the flush of victory, resolutely oppose the rise of a second Nobusuke Kishi, and fight to the end for the complete abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The telegram concluded by wishing the Japanese Democratic Youth League, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, to unite, educate, and lead the broad masses of Japanese youth in achieving greater achievements in completely smashing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and in the struggle for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and youth rights. It wished the congress a complete success and the friendship between the youth of China and Japan to develop day by day.

    日本民主青年同盟代表大会开幕
    我共青团中央致电祝日本青年高举反美爱国旗帜前进
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本民主青年同盟第六次全国代表大会今天在东京开幕。
    有来自日本各地的三百名代表参加的这次代表大会将讨论这个同盟目前的政策方针和阐明这个同盟的基本性质。这次为期三天的代表大会是在这样的口号下举行的：“让我们把我们的成员增加到三十万人，干部增加到一万人”。
    日本共产党中央委员会在今年3月举行的第九次临时全体会议上曾经通过关于扩大和加强民主青年同盟的决议。
    民主青年同盟的发言人对新闻记者们说，这个同盟的成员在过去三年中已经增加了三倍，在所有的县份中都建立了同盟的支部。
    发言人强调说，“为了适应局势的发展，迫切需要把这个同盟的成员增加到三十万人。从到目前为止已经取得的成就看来，这不是不可能的。”
    他又说，“第六次代表大会的基本任务是制订政策，使这个同盟的群众性与阶级斗争精神协调一致。”
    新华社25日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会24日致电日本民主同盟第六次代表大会，热烈祝贺大会的召开。
    电报说，日本民主青年同盟自成立以来，在日本共产党领导下，继承了日本革命青年运动的光荣传统，高举反对美帝国主义、反对复活日本军国主义的旗帜，团结广大日本青年为争取独立、民主、和平和中立，并为争取青年权利和社会进步进行了不懈的斗争。近年来，日本民主青年同盟又动员广大青年和人民一道，开展了轰轰烈烈的反对日美“安全条约”、促进中日友好和反对美日反动派制造“两个中国”阴谋的斗争，为维护日本民族利益和青年切身权利、为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重要的贡献。中国青年全力支持你们的正义斗争，并为你们所取得的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。
    电报说，日本人民和青年英勇顽强的斗争，已经成功地粉碎了美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的阴谋计划，迫使岸信介卖国贼可耻的宣布下台，这是对美日反动派的有力打击。日本人民的新胜利再一次证明，在强大的人民力量面前，美日反动派都是纸老虎，只要人民和青年加强团结，坚持斗争，美帝国主义和反动派是能够被击败的。
    电报指出，美日反动派把“互换”日美军事同盟条约“批准书”强加在日本人民头上，是美日反动派遭到一连串沉重打击后的垂死挣扎。这只能激起日本人民和青年的更大愤怒，促使日本人民和青年再接再厉，乘胜追击，坚决反对第二个岸信介上台，为彻底废除日美军事同盟条约而斗争到底。
    电报最后祝日本民主青年同盟在日本共产党领导下，团结、教育和带领日本广大青年在彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约，在争取独立、民主、和平、中立和青年权利的斗争中取得更大的成就。祝大会圆满成功，并祝中日两国青年之间的友谊日益发展。
