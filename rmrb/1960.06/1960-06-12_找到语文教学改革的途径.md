    Finding a Path for Chinese Language Teaching Reform
    Representative of Shang Le Village Elementary School, Ji County, Henan Province: Tian Xuexi
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, our school has conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy, launched vigorous mass movements in teaching, and significantly improved the quality of education. In particular, students' writing abilities have improved even more rapidly.
    Listening to the Party,
    Studying hard, striving to be
    Good students of Chairman Mao
    Previously, in two sixth-grade classes, only fifteen students could write compositions of about four hundred characters with correct ideas, relatively rich content, and relatively smooth sentences. Fifty students could write two hundred fifty to three hundred characters, with ungrammatical sentences, poor paragraphing, and incorrect use of punctuation. A few students could only write a few dozen characters in a composition. After more than half a year of reform in Chinese language teaching, not only has the length of compositions expanded, but also the ideas are broader and the quality has greatly improved. The students' articles mostly possess clear ideological content, smooth sentences, clear organization, and can correctly reflect reality and express their thoughts and feelings. For example, sixth-grade student Zhao Yueqiu wrote in a composition: "I saw an old man in his fifties on the construction site, digging with his back bare in the winter wind, covered in sweat. Another fellow was wearing a thick cotton coat and a felt hat, and after working for a long time, he didn't even have a hint of heat on his head. One is active, the other is not. The one with great enthusiasm is Uncle Cao Rang, he is a poor peasant, who suffered in the past. Now, in order to build his own happy life, he is full of energy, surpassing Huang Zhong. That other fellow is the landlord Sun Shufen, also a rightist. He can't ride on the backs of the people now, he hates the new society in his heart, so how can he labor actively!" Student Wang Jilan wrote in her composition "New Year's Eve": "I put on new clothes, a new scarf, and a bright red flower. When I looked in the mirror, I saw my mother's face was very serious, with two tears hanging from her eyes. I know one tear is seeing our happiness after the establishment of the People's Commune, and gratitude to the Party; the other tear is remembering my sister who starved to death fifteen years ago..."
    Currently, all students in the school are studying diligently and writing hard, forming a mass writing movement.
    The Great Leap Forward in Chinese language writing teaching has driven the great improvement in the quality of teaching in other subjects. In the second semester of the fifth grade, the average score on the final exam was 75 for Chinese and 82 for arithmetic. By the first semester of the sixth grade, the average score on the final exam rose to 89.9 for Chinese and 91 for arithmetic.
    In particular, students have greatly improved their communist consciousness through participating in social political movements, productive labor, and carrying out activities to read red books. Listening to the Party, studying hard, and striving to be good students of Chairman Mao has become everyone's common aspiration. Among the students, there were no Youth League members originally, but now there are nine, and three hundred and ten have applied to join the League. Xu Lanyu, a student who is only eleven years old this year, applied, saying: "Although I am not old enough, I want to be linked to the organization as soon as possible, seek guidance and help, and strive to join the League organization as soon as I reach the age." Seven students who participated in voluntary labor in the Beixinzhuang Brigade on January 11th worked shirtless, sweating profusely, like tigers and dragons. An old well-to-do middle peasant woman said: "No matter how active the children are, they can't eat more grain than me." After hearing this, the students immediately engaged in reasoning and struggle with her, leaving her speechless.

    With the revolutionary spirit of vigorously developing steel,
    Vigorously carry out education revolution
    Our methods for achieving the above preliminary results are:
    Since 1958, driven by the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our school, last July, the county party committee issued instructions on further implementing the Party's education policy and rapidly improving the quality of teaching, according to the instructions of the provincial and regional party committees. Faced with this glorious and arduous task, the school party branch conscientiously studied and implemented the instructions of the higher party committees, and decided to use the revolutionary spirit of vigorously developing steel to vigorously carry out education revolution and improve the quality of education at high speed.
    How should we start to improve the quality of teaching? Which main link should we grasp first to drive the overall situation? According to the working method of the mass line, we conducted investigations and research. After a series of work such as visits, investigations, and discussions among teachers and students, the branch further analyzed and studied that the Chinese language is the foundation for learning all subjects, and the quality of the Chinese language is mainly reflected in composition. Therefore, we must first grasp the Great Leap Forward in composition teaching. How can composition teaching achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward? After further understanding and reviewing the students' old composition books, it was found that teachers had many rigid rules and regulations in guiding the revision of compositions: such as mechanically restricting students from submitting their papers in class without considering the specific situation, and criticizing students' compositions for not having a prominent theme and having disorganized content, which seriously restricted students' thinking and resulted in students' compositions being too short and the content being poor. Therefore, it was decided to first let go and mobilize the masses, liberate thought, broaden ideas, and start by breaking through quantity to achieve the goal of improving quality.
    At the beginning, some teachers doubted this call. Their reasons were: ① The increase in Chinese language knowledge requires long-term accumulation, and the improvement of composition quality can only be gradual, not a leap forward. ② They themselves only wrote articles of about 1,000 characters when they graduated from junior high school. Now the students are young and have a poor foundation. If the target is too high and they are forced to do so, it will inevitably damage the children's health. In response to this idea, the party branch called on all teachers and students not to be slaves to teaching conventions, but to be pioneers of the education revolution. The party branch organized all teachers to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, and through study, powerfully exposed and criticized the old frameworks and old rules, the "slowly come" and other conservative ideas in teaching. After a fierce ideological struggle, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought was finally planted on the ideological front of teaching reform. Most teachers deeply realized that the traditional concepts of bourgeois pedagogy and the conventions of teaching are the talisman of all fear of difficulties and conservatism in teaching revolution. If the raging fire of teaching revolution is not ignited and the influence of bourgeois education ideology is not burned out, the teaching reform cannot advance by leaps and bounds along the bright road of the General Line.

    Finding a path for the Great Leap Forward in Chinese language teaching
    After investigation, the branch believed that the main reason why Chinese language teaching could not leap forward in the past was that Chinese language teaching was not sufficiently combined with politics and production. Teachers were divorced from reality when setting questions and guiding students in writing compositions, and criticized too much, which greatly dampened students' enthusiasm for writing compositions. For example, students reflected: "Composition is difficult, composition is difficult, my heart is upset when composition is mentioned." Students also reflected that: "The topic that the teacher gives us is something that I usually have no impression of, I have nothing in my stomach, how can I write well, wouldn't it be better to ask me to write about what I know?" The branch analyzed that teachers were subjectivist and divorced from reality when guiding students in writing compositions. Students do not understand what to write about in the composition, so they have difficulties in writing the composition. Conversely, when guiding students to write compositions in connection with their ideological and life reality, students have something to write about, the ideology is strong, the content is rich, and the writing is vivid. Therefore, we must first let students open their minds and let go to write. On the basis of writing more, we will then require them to write smoothly, write well, and write precisely. Based on the above analysis, teachers are required to put forward different requirements for writing more, writing smoothly, writing well, and writing precisely, according to the different situations of the students. When students dare not write or cannot write a lot, they must not scare the students with standards that are divorced from reality and a lot of criticism. Guiding composition must be closely linked to the students' lives, production, and ideological reality. When correcting compositions, we must abide by the principle of correcting less when there is more, affirming more advantages, and criticizing less. At the same time, we must specifically organize students to participate in production struggles and class struggles, and consciously give inspiration and guidance to improve students' ideological understanding, enrich students' emotions, and expand students' horizons. For example, in a labor activity of participating in the military camp production brigade to cut soybeans, the composition topic of "Large Corps Operations" was set in advance, so that students could carefully consider and pay attention to observing the labor scene. After returning to school, focusing on cultivation, Hou Quanyou wrote an article of more than 1,300 characters, achieving the planned target, and the content was relatively vivid and full. The branch firmly grasped this typical example and talked about it extensively among teachers and students, and organized teachers and students to have discussion meetings. The students said one after another: "Hou Quanyou is learning about the same as us, listening to the teacher's lecture and participating in labor, he can exceed 1,000, we must also be able to break through 1,000." This increased the confidence of teachers and students in rapidly improving composition teaching. Then the school organized students to participate in the labor of "straightening the bends" of the Wei River, and asked the students to write a composition entitled "A Corner of the River Excavation Site." Before the labor departure, the teacher told the students about the great significance of "straightening the bends" of the Wei River. On the road, at the construction site, and on the way back to school, he raised a series of inspiring questions: Everyone, think carefully about the significance of "straightening the bends" of the Wei River? Did such a thing happen in the old society? We are going to dig the river, how do everyone feel? Go there and see how the peasant uncles are laboring? Students should carefully observe the scene on the construction site, and everyone should think about what we have gained from this labor? How much achievement? Now we are going back to school, how do everyone feel? Because the students have gone through personal experience, the impression is deep, coupled with the teacher's inspiration and guidance, the content is more specific. Therefore, this composition is rich in content, and the length is very full, generally written about 3,000 characters. Hou Quanyou, Wang Jilan and other students wrote more than 6,000 characters.
    After the students' compositions were enlarged in length, the following situations occurred: ① Students urgently requested to master more vocabulary and basic writing knowledge. ② Some students' compositions deviated too far from the topic, the levels and paragraphs were not clear enough, and the focus was not prominent. ③ Wrong words appeared repeatedly. In order to quickly improve the quality of composition, according to the existing problems, the branch put forward the requirement of "marching towards writing well and writing precisely." On the basis of affirming the achievements of the previous stage, the method of closely combining classroom and extracurricular was adopted. What is taught in the classroom is done outside the classroom, what is done is said, and how it is said is how it is written, so that the classroom is twisted into a rope, and the teaching, doing, saying and writing form a dragon. In order to give a good lesson, the teachers strived to thoroughly understand the four properties (ideological, systematic, accurate, distinct) and grasp the four points (the focus and difficulty of the teaching material, the connection point between new and old knowledge, the weak point of the teaching material) in the preparation of lessons. Students have achieved five good (prepare well, listen well, take notes well, do homework well, review well) and five more (more reading, more watching, more writing, more practicing, more research) in order to learn their lessons well. For example, when teaching the sixth-grade third volume of Chinese language "Change", in order to teach the lesson well, the teacher investigated and visited the huge economic changes of the working people in five villages before and after liberation. The teacher told that the working people in Shang Le Village met with a drought in 1943, 70% of them fled to Shanxi and Henan (south of the Yellow River), 89 people were sold outside, and 259 people died of starvation and are now missing. The landlords occupied the land, and a family of six only had a tattered quilt and other tragic facts. Yan Qingbo and other students were so sad to hear the tragic lives of the working people before liberation that they shed tears. When talking about the happy lives of the people after communization, the students were all smiling. After this lesson, the teacher set the topic "The Great Changes in My Hometown" for the students to compose. Before the composition, the students were arranged to visit three poor peasant families each, and an interview report meeting was organized. This report meeting was a meeting to accuse the old society and praise the new society. The students were deeply moved by the many vivid facts of the great changes in their hometown. Everyone had thousands of words waiting to be written. The teacher enlightened the students to set up their own frames first (that is, to make an outline) and then write the content. Because of the in-depth practice, the feeling is profound, the idea is open, there is something to say, and the result of this composition is not only expanded in length, but also the content is vivid and the idea is clear. Also, because the writing method of "setting up the frame first and then writing the content" was implemented in the composition, many students' compositions achieved clear levels and smooth sentences.

    Students' communist moral character
    Is growing rapidly
    Language knowledge is a tool for writing. After the students opened their minds and broke through the quantity pass, while putting forward the "marching towards writing well and writing precisely", the party branch also proposed to pay great attention to enriching students' language knowledge. In order to strengthen the basic Chinese language knowledge training for students, they organized students to widely collect vocabulary, carry out activities of reading and writing a lot, "thousands of poems and songs" and "ten, ten, five (students memorize ten words, read ten pages of books, and make five sentences every day), and established book corners in all classes. The two sixth-grade classes have more than 1,000 books. In the past six months, students have read more than ten kinds of books such as "Red Teenager", "Dedicate Everything to the Party", "Children's Dusty Journey", "Lin Hai Xue Yuan" and so on. In order to train students' oral expression ability, the school arranges activities such as speech meetings, poetry recitation meetings, and reading experience report meetings every week. And organize students to widely collect the rich vocabulary of the masses from extracurricular reading, from the activities of productive labor and social struggle, and classify the collected vocabulary into volumes according to synonyms, antonyms, etc., and extract and learn beautiful words from extracurricular reading from the masses. At present, each student has collected an average of about 400 beautiful words, and the two classes have collected more than 1,500 folk songs. In addition, each student also has an extracurricular writing exercise book, combined with productive labor and political movements, to carry out writing activities. For example, combined with this year's New Year's Day publicity, in one afternoon, some students wrote more than a dozen allegro poems, and some reached dozens. Combined with drought resistance, in one extracurricular activity, each person wrote more than ten allegro poems. In the past year, the sixth grade has written more than 80,000 allegro poems. The class also has "Heart Talk, Bright Flowers, Model Column, Reading Experience" and other writing gardens. Through these activities, students' writing ability has been exercised. The rapid improvement of the quality of students' compositions not only drove the comprehensive improvement of other subjects, but also significantly promoted the rapid growth of students' communist moral character. The students' labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. The students have reflected that: "Labor is my composition field class, a training ground for 'red and expert', and it cannot be made up for if it is missing." The students' class viewpoints are also clearer, and their love and hatred are also more distinct.
    While carrying out a lot of reading and writing, we also paid attention to the lectures and reviews of compositions, and in the lectures and reviews, we especially paid attention to political and ideological guidance. For example, once the teacher saw a passage in the students' composition: "... I must respect the teacher, unite and be friendly with classmates, listen to the Party, and be a five-good student." The teacher saw that listening to the Party was placed in the third place, and realized that the students' understanding of the Party was still vague, so he conducted political and ideological education to the whole class in the composition lecture and review class.
    In the explanation, not only the guidance of political and ideological content is emphasized, but also the guidance of writing skills is also noted. In the past year, the sixth grade alone has organized 48 lectures and reviews of various sizes, corrected a total of more than 180 sick sentences, and selected more than 400 excellent words, sentences (paragraphs). In order to make the students use the words properly, in the classroom vocabulary teaching, in addition to focusing on the meaning of the words, the extended meaning of the words is also explained in conjunction with the text, and the usage of the words is repeatedly illustrated with examples. In order to reduce the wrong words in the composition, on the one hand, the teaching of correct pronunciation and word discrimination in Chinese language teaching was strengthened, and on the other hand, the registration of wrong words was implemented, and the correct and wrong table of wrong words was announced in the classroom, so that students could often check and identify them, and the movement week to eliminate wrong words was carried out in each grade. Combined with the teaching of various subjects, the work of correcting wrong words was strengthened from many aspects. As a result, the wrong words in the compositions of each class have been greatly reduced.
    Our school started by grasping the Chinese language teaching, which promoted the comprehensive bumper harvest of other subjects. It is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Party's General Line, and the victory of the Party's education policy. Experience has proved that in order to do a good job in teaching, we must strengthen the Party's leadership, liberate our minds, resolutely fight against bourgeois educational thinking, adhere to the mass line, and vigorously carry out mass movements, so that teaching can continue to improve and continue to move forward. Now we are holding high the red flag of the Party's education revolution, and under the leadership of the higher party committee, we will push the teaching reform to a newer stage.

    找到语文教学改革的途径
    河南省汲县上乐村小学代表　田雪熙
    我校在党的总路线、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，认真贯彻执行了党的教育方针，在教学中，大搞群众运动，教育质量有了显著提高。特别是学生的写作能力，提高得更为迅速。
    听党的话，努力
    学习，争取作
    毛主席的好学生
    在以前六年级两个班，作文能写四百字左右，思想正确，内容比较丰富，语句比较通顺的只有十五名学生，能写二百五十至三百字，语句不通顺，分不好段落，不会使用标点符号的有五十名，有少数同学一篇作文只能写几十个字。经过半年多来对语文教学的改革，现在不仅作文的篇幅扩大了，而且思路也比较广阔，质量大有提高，学生们写的文章大都具有鲜明的思想性，语句通顺，层次较分明，能正确地反映现实和表达自己的思想感情。如六年级的学生赵月秋在一篇作文中写道：“我在工地上看到一个五十多岁的老伯伯，冬天刮着大北风，光着背满头大汗的挖着，另一个家伙穿着很厚的棉袄，戴着毡帽，劳动了老半天头上连一点热气都没冒。一个积极，一个不积极，干劲大的是曹让老伯伯，他是贫农，过去受苦，现在为了建设自己的幸福生活，干劲冲天，赛过黄忠，那一个家伙是地主孙树芬，也是右派分子，他现在不能骑在人民头上，心里恨新社会，咋会积极劳动！”王继兰同学在“除夕”一篇作文中这样写道：“我穿上了新衣服，围上了新围巾，戴上了鲜艳的红花，照镜子的时候，看到了母亲面孔非常严肃，眼上挂着两颗泪珠。我知道一颗泪珠是看到成立人民公社后我们的幸福，对党的感激；另一颗泪珠是想起十五年前饿死了的姐姐……”。
    目前，全校学生都认真学习，努力写作，形成了群众性的写作运动。
    语文写作教学的大跃进带动了其他各科教学质量的大提高。六年级在五下时，期考平均语文七十五分，算术八十二分，到六年级上学期，期考平均：语文上升为八十九点九分，算术上升为九十一分。
    尤其是学生通过参加社会政治运动，生产劳动和开展读红书活动，共产主义觉悟大大提高。听党的话，努力学习，争取作毛主席的好学生，成了每个人的共同心愿。学生中，原来没有团员，现有团员九名，并有三百一十人次提出入团申请。今年才十一岁的徐兰玉同学提出申请说：“我虽然年龄不够，但早日和组织挂上钩，求得教导帮助，争取年龄一到就加入团的组织。”元月11日到北辛庄大队参加义务劳动的七名同学，赤臂上阵，汗流满面，像生龙活虎一般。一个老富裕中农妇女说：“小孩们再积极也不能比我多吃一点粮食。”同学们听到后立刻与她展开说理斗争，把她弄得哑口无声。
    以大办钢铁的革命气魄，
    大搞教育革命
    我们取得以上初步成绩的作法是：
    1958年以来，我校在工农业生产持续大跃进的推动下，去年7月县委根据省、地委的指示，发出了关于进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，迅速提高教学质量的指示。面对这一光荣艰巨的任务，学校党支部认真学习贯彻了上级党委的指示，决定以大办钢铁的革命气魄，大搞教育革命，高速度地提高教育质量。
    提高教学质量应如何着手？先抓那个主要环节才能带动全面呢？按照群众路线的工作方法，进行了调查研究。经过在师生中访问、调查、座谈等一系列工作，支部进一步分析研究认为语文科是学好各科的基础，而语文质量的高低，主要又体现在作文上，因此首先要抓作文教学的大跃进。作文教学又如何全面大跃进呢？经过进一步了解和翻阅学生过去的老作文本，发现教师在指导作文批改中有不少清规戒律：如不从具体情况出发，机械的限制学生当堂交卷，指责学生的作文主题不突出，内容杂乱等等，严重束缚了学生的思想，致使学生的作文篇幅太短，内容贫乏。因此，决定首先放手发动群众，解放思想，广开思路，从突破数量着手，达到提高质量的目的。
    开始这个号召也有少数教师怀疑，他们的理由是：①语文知识的增长需要长期的积累，提高作文质量只能渐进不能跃进。②自己初中毕业时才写一千字左右的文章，现在学生年龄小基础差，指标太高，硬要这样做，势必损伤儿童的健康等。党支部针对这种思想就号召全体师生不要做教学陈规的奴隶，要当教育革命的闯将。组织全体教师认真学习了毛主席的著作，通过学习有力地揭发批判了旧框框老规矩“慢慢来”等教学上的保守思想。经过剧烈的思想斗争，终于在教学改革的思想战线上，插上了毛泽东思想的红旗。大部分教师深刻地认识到：资产阶级教育学的传统观念和教学的陈规是教学革命中一切畏难情绪和保守主义的护身符。不点燃起教学革命上的万丈烈火，不烧尽资产阶级教育思想的影响，就不能使教学改革沿着总路线的光明大道突飞猛进。
    寻找语文教学大跃进的途径
    支部为了寻找语文教学大跃进的途径，经过调查，认为过去语文教学不能跃进的主要原因是由于语文教学结合政治结合生产不够。教师在出题和指导学生作文时脱离实际，指责过多，大大挫伤了学生作文的积极性。如学生反映：“作文难，作文难，一提作文心就烦”，学生还反映说：“老师出的题俺平时就没印象，肚里没有东西咋能写好，叫俺写自己知道的事不好吗？”支部分析：教师在指导学生作文时主观主义，脱离实际。学生对作文要写的东西不了解，作文就有困难。反之，凡是结合学生思想和生活实际指导学生作文，学生就有东西可写，思想性就强，内容就丰富，文字就生动。因此必须先让学生敞开思想，放手去写。在写多的基础上再要求写通、写好、写精。基于上述分析，要求教师根据学生不同情况，提出写多、写通、写好、写精的不同要求，在学生不敢写不能写多的时候，决不能以脱离实际的标准和一大堆的非难去吓唬学生。指导作文要紧密联系学生生活、生产、思想实际。在批改作文时要遵守多就少改，多肯定优点，少批评的原则。同时要具体组织学生参加生产斗争和阶级斗争，并有意识加以启发和诱导以提高学生的思想认识，丰富学生的情感，扩大学生的眼界。如在参加军营生产大队割豆子的一次劳动中，事前出了“大兵团作战”的作文题目，让学生认真考虑和注意观察劳动场面。返校后培养重点，侯全有写出了一篇一千三百多字的文章，实现了计划指标，内容也较生动充实。支部紧紧抓住这个典型，在师生中大讲特讲，组织师生座谈讨论。同学们纷纷表态说：“侯全有和我们学习差不多，一样听老师讲，一样参加劳动，他能超过一千，我们也一定能突破一千”。这样就增加了师生们迅速提高作文教学的信心。接着学校组织了学生参加卫河“裁弯取直”的劳动，并让学生写了一篇“挖河工地上的一角”的作文。在劳动出发前，教师向学生讲了卫河“裁弯取直”的重大意义，在路上、工地上和回校途中又提出了一系列的启发性的问题，大家好好想一想卫河“裁弯取直”有什么意义？在旧社会有这样的事吗？我们就要去挖河，大家的心情怎样？到那边看农民伯伯在怎样的劳动？同学们好好观察一下工地上的景象，大家想一想这次劳动我们有哪些收获？有多大成绩？现在我们要回校了，大家有着怎样的心情？由于同学们经过了亲身感受，印象深刻，再加上老师启发、诱导，更加具体。所以这次作文都写得内容丰富，而且篇幅都很充实，一般都写有三千字左右，侯全有、王继兰等同学就写了六千多字。
    学生的作文放大篇幅之后，出现了以下一些情况：①学生迫切要求掌握更多的语汇和写作的基本知识。②部分学生作文离题太远，层次段落不够清楚，重点不突出。③错别字反复出现。支部为了迅速提高作文质量，根据存在问题提出了“向写好写精大进军”的要求，在肯定前段成绩的基础上采取了课内课外紧密结合的方法，课内讲什么，课外就做什么，做什么就说什么，怎样说就怎样写，使堂内堂外拧成一股绳，使讲、做、说、写组成一条龙。教师为了把课讲好，在备课中力争钻透四性（思想性、系统性、准确性，鲜明性），掌握四点（教材的重点、难点，新旧知识联系点，教材的薄弱点）。学生为把功课学好，都做到了五好（预习好，听课好，笔记好，作业好、复习好）五多（多读、多看、多写、多练，多钻研）。如在讲六年级三册语文“变”一课时，为了把课讲好，教师调查访问了五个村的劳动人民在解放前后经济的巨大变化。教师讲述了上乐村的劳动人民在1943年遇到旱灾时上山西、下河南（黄河以南）逃荒的占70％，卖在外边的有八十九人，饿死和现在下落不明的二百五十九人，地主霸占着土地，一家六口人只有一条破烂被子等悲惨事实，阎清波等同学听到解放前劳动人民所过的悲惨生活难过得流下泪来，当讲到现在公社化后人民的幸福生活时，同学们都喜笑颜开。这一课讲完后，教师出了“家乡的巨变”的题目让学生作文。在作文之前又布置同学每人访问三家贫农，并组织了访问报告会。这个报告会是一个对旧社会的控诉会，也是对新社会的歌颂会。同学们被家乡巨变的许多生动事实深深地感动了，每人都有千言万语等待着要写，教师就启发学生自己先搭架子（即列出提纲），再写内容。由于深入实际，感受深刻，思路开阔，有话可写，结果这次作文不仅篇幅扩大，而且内容生动，思想鲜明。又由于在作文中贯彻了“先搭架子后写内容”这一写作方法，因而不少学生作文达到层次清楚，语句通顺。
    学生的共产主义道德品质
    正在迅速成长
    语言知识是写作的工具，在学生开了思路，突破了数量关之后，在提出“向写好写精大进军”的同时，党支部又提出要十分注意丰富学生的语言知识。为了加强对学生的语文基本知识训练，便组织学生广泛地收集词汇，开展大读大写、“千诗万歌”和“十、十、五（学生每天记十个词，看十页书，造五个句）活动，班班都建立图书角，六年级两班就有图书一千余册，半年多来，学生阅读了“红色少年”、“把一切献给党”、“儿女风尘记”、“林海雪原”等十余种。为了训练学生的口头表达能力，学校每周安排有演讲会，诗歌朗诵会，读书心得报告会等活动。并组织学生从课内课外阅读中，从生产劳动和社会斗争的活动中，广泛地收集群众的丰富词汇，将收集来的词汇，按近义词、同义词、反义词等分类汇集成册，从课外阅读中从群众中摘录学习优美的词语，目前，每个同学已平均收集优美的词语约四百个，两班共收集民歌一千五百余首，另外每个学生还都备有课外写作练习本，结合生产劳动和政治运动，开展写作活动。如结合今年元旦宣传，一个下午，有的学生就写出快板诗歌十几首，多的达到几十首，结合抗旱，一个课外活动，每个人就写出快板十余首。一年来，六年级共写诗歌快板八万余首。班里还开设有“心底话、鲜艳花朵、标兵栏、读书心得”等写作园地，通过这些活动，锻炼了学生的写作能力。学生作文质量的迅速提高，不仅带动了其它各科的全面提高，更显著的是促进了学生的共产主义道德品质迅速成长。学生的劳动热情空前高涨，同学们都反映说：“劳动是俺的作文现场课，是‘红专’的练武场，缺了没法补。”学生的阶级观点也更加明确了，爱憎也更加分明。
    在开展大读大写的同时，还重视了作文的讲评，在讲评中，又特别注意了政治思想性指导，如有一次教师看到学生作文中有这样一段话：“……我一定要尊敬老师，和同学团结友爱，听党的话，做一个五好学生。”教师看到把听党的话放在第三位，就意识到学生对党的认识还模糊，在作文讲评课中向全班进行了政治思想教育。
    在讲解中，不仅重视政治思想内容的指导，同时还注意了写作技巧的指导。近一年来，仅六年级即组织大小讲评四十八次，共纠正病句一百八十多句，选出优秀的话、句（段）共四百多。为了使同学们用词得当，在课堂词汇教学中，除着重讲词的本意外，还结合课文讲词的引伸意义，并反复举例说明词的用法。为了减少作文中的错别字，一方面加强了语文教学的正音辨字的教学，一方面实行错别字登记，制出错别字正误表公布在教室里，让同学经常查对辨认，并在各年级开展了扫除错别字的运动周。结合各科教学从多方面加强改正错别字的工作，结果在各班作文中的错别字大大减少了。
    我校从大抓语文教学着手，促使了其他各科全面大丰收。是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利。经验证明，搞好教学工作，必须加强党的领导，解放思想，坚决的和资产阶级教育思想展开斗争，坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，才能使教学工作不断提高，不断前进。现在我们正在高举着党的教育革命红旗，在上级党委的领导下，把教学改革推向更新的阶段。
