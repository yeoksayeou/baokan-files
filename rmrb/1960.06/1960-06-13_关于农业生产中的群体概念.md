On the Concept of the Group in Agricultural Production
Yin Hongzhang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The great leap forward in agricultural production since 1958 has presented a series of new topics for scientific research. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, plant physiology workers have gone deep into the people's communes, worked with farmers, and gained great harvests in exploring and summarizing high-yield measures and experiences. These harvests are of great significance for opening up new research fields and creating new scientific theories.

Group Physiology and the Concept of the Group

The gradual formation of the concept of the group is one of our major gains over the past year or so. In the past, our plant physiological research was based on individual plants, either potted single plants, "field experiments" of a few square feet, or detached leaves or cells. The knowledge accumulated in this way is certainly useful to some extent, but it is far from practice, and much of it cannot be used in agricultural production. Some people even think that agricultural production is just a technical problem, and that it is enough to simply expand some of the knowledge and rules obtained from the study of individuals. Only after working with farmers in the fields did we truly realize that this understanding has great limitations. The purpose of agricultural production is to obtain a higher yield on a piece of land, that is, the yield of this crop group, and the group yield is not necessarily an unlimited increase in the yield of each individual. Although the group is composed of individuals, it has its own characteristics and laws of development, and can be said to be a higher-level law, just like the relationship between society and individuals. Therefore, much of the plant physiological research must start from the group point of view, and regard a field as an organic whole. The group has its own structure and performance, its own physiological regulation and control ability; it is affected by the environment, and at the same time it transforms the internal environment, such as field illumination and microclimate, etc.; it is composed of individuals, and at the same time it affects each individual. These interrelationships and development laws cannot be completely deduced by studying only individuals. We should never isolate individuals or groups, especially in the case of dense planting, where the relationship between plants is close, and the study of individuals must take into account that it is a part of the group, in order to understand its role and solve practical problems in agricultural production.

Group physiology can also be said to be a new department in plant physiology. It is a bit like ecology, but it is not satisfied with the analysis of the environment and the composition and succession of communities (organisms that live together and are closely related to certain living conditions), but combines the biological laws of the group with the physiological activities of the individual, and studies the mutual influence, the contradictions, the unity of contradictions and the way of control between them. At present, our research on the concept of the group is only a beginning, and we must gradually clarify it through practice and gradually complete it; and we must create new methods and technologies through summarizing farmers' experience and learning advanced scientific ideas to gradually deepen and improve it.

Group Structure and Light Energy Utilization

How does the concept of the group help us analyze the relationship between plant photosynthesis and yield? We all know that the organic matter produced by plants by means of the sun's ability to reduce carbon dioxide and decompose water is the source of all products. Although people have done a lot of research on photosynthesis, and have a considerable understanding of the physical and chemical reaction processes, they have not been able to propose a way to make fuller use of sunlight. The agricultural production process is only superficially analyzed, pointing out that the increase in yield is mainly due to the increase in leaf area, that is, the increase in the area that receives sunlight. However, there is a limit to the increase in leaf area, which cannot exceed four to five times the ground area. Beyond this limit, the yield cannot be increased, and may even decrease. Why is this? Can it be improved? In the past, because there was no guiding theory, there was no way to start. Moreover, people always treat the upper and lower leaf surfaces equally, regardless of how much light they actually receive; the calculation method adopted is to divide the increase in dry matter by the total leaf area to obtain the so-called "photosynthetic productivity." In fact, this quantity has no meaning, let alone represents the strength of the leaves' photosynthetic capacity, but causes confusion and illusion.

From the perspective of the group, this problem is very clear, which shows that it is unreasonable to use such a simplified algorithm. First of all, it must be taken into account that the upper and lower layers of leaves in a field have different opportunities and amounts of light reception, and the light distribution must be known. Secondly, it is also necessary to consider that the photosynthetic intensity of the leaves is not directly proportional to the light energy received. In weak light, photosynthesis increases with light intensity, but there is a certain limit. Rice only needs about one-third of the sunlight irradiation at noon in summer to reach saturation, and no matter how strong the light is, it cannot be used. One method used in ecology is to divide a field of rice or wheat from top to bottom into several layers, measure the leaf area of each layer, measure the light intensity of each layer, calculate the photosynthesis of each layer of leaves, and then integrate to obtain the total light and yield of the field. This method is more in line with the actual situation, and the calculated result is closer to the actual yield figure, which can be used to further analyze the impact of various measures.

The entire light energy utilization problem is obviously related to the structure of the group. The larger the total leaf area, the more light is absorbed. What is the best leaf area? This cannot be generalized, it depends on the structure of the group, that is, the size of each leaf, their arrangement, angle, as well as the nature of reflection and transmission of light. For example, thick and large leaves are laid horizontally, and one layer almost blocks all the light, and no more can grow below. This is the case with ivy, where the leaves are embedded in each other and laid flat in one layer. How big the ground is, the total area of light reception can only be as big as the ground. This is not economical for light energy utilization. If the leaves stand up obliquely, the situation is much better. First, such a leaf receives less light intensity, but the area of light reception is larger, which is conducive to photosynthesis. Second, the oblique leaves have a small downward projection, and there are fewer opportunities to cover the leaves below, and more light leaks, so that the leaves below can receive more light energy. Third, the reflection of this kind of leaf is not all upward, but a part is reflected downward into the field for other leaves to use, and the utilization rate is the highest. The group structure of rice and wheat fields is better. Their leaves are small and close to erect, so a large total leaf area can be accommodated on a piece of land, which means that it is more suitable for dense planting and can make fuller use of light energy.

What kind of group structure is the most reasonable and can make the most of solar energy? In theory, it can be calculated. A few suitable assumptions can be used to calculate how big the leaves are best, how they should be arranged, and at what angle. However, this calculation is very complicated. The intensity of sunlight is different every day, the angles are different, and the direct light and scattered light must be treated differently. This is not as good as measuring the structure of different plots more, comparing them, or artificially making some models for research and simulation, which is easier to obtain results. The theory of group structure and light energy utilization obtained in this way will not only be useful for rice and wheat, but also for other crops, as well as forests and natural communities, or the cultivation of single-celled algae.

Some people may ask, even if the most reasonable group structure is found, what method can be used to achieve such a structure? This requires further research, and this complex problem will be discussed below. In fact, many agricultural measures and farmers' experiences are mainly to achieve this goal. Soil, fertilizer, water, seed, and density all have an impact on the group structure, and can be used to control it. For example, some varieties have relatively erect leaves, and some have relatively flat leaves. From the perspective of light energy utilization and suitability for dense planting, the former is obviously better, so it should be used as one of the criteria for seed selection. The row spacing and row direction of planting are related to the group structure and light energy utilization. For example, Jiang Deyu, a rice labor model in Tianjin, pointed out that east-west rows are better than north-south rows. Rice field baking also affects the structure. We have seen a field where the leaves grow luxuriantly, are relatively flat, and hang downwards, which severely blocks light. After drainage and field baking, the leaves stood up in two or three days, and the light distribution was greatly improved. There are many more valuable experiences like this.

Therefore, analyzing light energy utilization from the concept of the group provides a theoretical basis for the experience data obtained in the past, such as the relationship between leaf area and yield. At the same time, it corrects the limitations and deviations in the past views, and further points out the possibility and ways for further improvement. Of course, improving the light energy utilization rate through the group structure is only one aspect of the problem. It must be combined with the study of individual physiology and the physical and chemical mechanisms of photosynthesis to further enhance the photosynthetic capacity of each leaf to increase agricultural output.

For the group, light is only one of the external environmental factors. Although it is the most important and basic, other factors must also be considered, such as the temperature, humidity, air composition and wind speed in the field, which can affect plant photosynthesis and other physiological activities, and are also related to the density and structure of the group. As for the situation of the underground part of the crop, such as the interaction between roots, between roots and soil and microorganisms, and the absorption of water and fertilizer, etc., it is more complicated and needs to be further analyzed and studied.

Development, Regulation and Control of the Group

A group is not static, like an organism, it is constantly changing and developing. Therefore, the so-called most reasonable group structure must explain when it is most reasonable. From the perspective of grain yield, special attention should be paid to the structure in the later period, that is, from the time of heading to near maturity. Because our tests have proved that the substances in the grains are mainly accumulated by photosynthesis during this period, and the amount of light energy used at this time is most related to the yield. Moreover, at this time, the plants no longer grow, the structure is relatively stable, and the plants are very dense, with many leaves, and the influence of the group is the greatest. Therefore, at this time, there is hope to achieve a group structure that can make full use of light energy.

To achieve the most reasonable group structure in the later stage of crop growth, it is necessary to understand the development laws of the group and its regulatory and control performance. Each development stage of an organism is affected by the environment at that time and the historical development in the past, and at the same time affects the development of the next stage. In the entire development process, a group forms a self-regulating system within a certain range. It can be appropriately controlled through changes in the environment and artificial measures to achieve the results we expect.

It may be useful to analyze the development law of the group with the example of tiller growth and death. Rice or wheat can tiller. A seed grows a main stem, and then branches are produced from the lower part of the main stem. Each tiller will grow roots again and may form a panicle. The range of the number of tillers is very large. A "rice king" can produce hundreds of tillers. In extremely dense fields, a rice plant may only have the main stem heading and no tillers. The main stem and tillers together determine the total number of plants in a field and the final number of panicles, so the number of tillers is closely related to the yield.

Since plants continue to produce tillers in the early stage, and some of them die in the later stage, the total number of plants in a field is not constant, but is constantly changing. If we regularly count the number of plants in the field, we will find that it has a certain law of growth and death. After a few days of greening after transplanting, we can see that the number of plants rises linearly. The sparser or more fertile the field, the more tillers are produced and the faster the rise. The denser the field, the slower the rise. The rate of rise seems to be directly proportional to the area occupied by the plant. After a few days, the number of plants still rises, but the rate of rise gradually decreases. The number of plants reaches its peak in about 20 days to a month, and then begins to decline. The peak is reached earlier in dense fields and later in sparse fields. The rate of decline is also gradually decreasing. The number of plants approaches a stable state during the booting stage and no longer increases or decreases significantly. Some fields still have some rebound and small fluctuations in the later stage. The reason for the increase in the number of plants is of course the increase in tillers, and the reason for the decrease is the death of some tillers due to shading.

Comparing fields with different planting densities, several meaningful phenomena can be seen. First, the plant group is a very self-regulating system. Sparse planting fields have more tillers, which increases the density by itself; in excessively dense fields, there are fewer tillers, or the density is naturally thinned by the death of tillers; and finally a relatively similar density is reached. For example, the early rice we planted had densities of 410,000, 800,000, and 1,190,000 mu, that is, a ratio of 1:2:3; at the time of heading, the densities of the three fields were 660,000, 980,000, and 1,380,000, close to 1:1.5:2. The late rice is more obvious. The number of seedlings planted per mu ranged from 30,000 to 360,000, a difference of 12 times, while the final number of panicles ranged from 190,000 to 340,000, a difference of less than one time; the several fields in the middle were closer from 90,000 to 270,000 seedlings, and the final number of panicles was about 250,000. Second, like all automatic control systems, group regulation can also be said to be carried out through a "feedback" effect (the effect of the change in turn affects the change itself). This is especially obvious when the crop is naturally thinned in the later stage. When the number of plants continues to increase to a certain density, it changes the environment, especially causing shading. The plants below cannot see enough light, cannot maintain themselves, and gradually wither and die. This "feedback" proceeds relatively slowly, so the density of the plants will inevitably "rush over" the most suitable range, and then decrease and gradually stabilize. Third, it should be pointed out that these regulatory effects are statistical. That is to say, from the perspective of the entire group, the average number of plant growth and death cannot determine how many tillers each plant actually produces. For example, some people advocate only the main stem and no tillers. In fact, it just means that the number of plants planted is similar to the final number of plants. It does not mean that each plant should only retain the main stem and have no tillers at all. Especially since planting cannot be 100% uniform and the performance of plants cannot be exactly the same, some plants will always produce one or two tillers, while other plants will not be able to keep even the main stem. To definitely not produce tillers, it is necessary to plant extremely densely, so that the plants maintain a nutrient area far below that required for tillering, and as a result, a large number of main stems will inevitably die. Conversely, some people advocate sparse planting, so that the number of tillers per plant reaches the highest number. This is also unreasonable. Because this will inevitably lead to extremely sparse planting, some plants will mature before all the tillers have fully grown, so it will definitely not reach the highest density and cannot make full use of light energy and land fertility. Fourth, it can also be seen here that the uniformity of plant growth in the group is also a very important issue. If the planting is uneven, the measures are uneven, or the varieties are different, and the growth is uneven, the plants or tillers with backward and short growth will become more and more unable to keep up, and will get less and less sunlight and nutrients, and will gradually weaken and even die. Therefore, experienced farmers emphasize selecting seeds that are uniform and consistent in growth, which is scientifically based. Conversely, some people advocate mixed sowing of tall and short varieties, thinking that this can use sunlight in layers, which is also an unreasonable idea.

The above is the law of plant growth and death in a field. The growth and death of leaf area is almost the same. From here, we can first see that to finally achieve a fairly high number of panicles, that is, a fairly high yield, we must first plant densely, and it cannot be too sparse. As for how much should be planted, the range is very large. Secondly, we see that the growth of the group gradually increases, reaches its highest, and then decreases. It is best for it to grow fast in the early stage, so that it can make full use of light energy and strengthen the plants as soon as possible. And do not let it "rush" too high in the later stage, causing a large number of deaths. This requires some measures. Farmers have many valuable experiences in this regard. For example, using appropriate fertilization, irrigation, and field baking to promote tillering, inhibit growth in the later stage, and change the group structure, the so-called "fertilizing according to the seedlings," such as Chen Yongkang's "three blacks and three yellows," are all control methods that need to be deeply analyzed. It must be stated that the group's automatic regulation, the planting density is very different and the final number of plants is close, does not mean that a limit has been reached here, such as 250,000 panicles per mu, which cannot be increased further. This is only the number of panicles under the general conditions in an area. If the measures are improved and improved varieties are selected, the final number of panicles can still be increased.

Contradiction and Unity between Group and Individual

Emphasizing the significance of the group concept does not neglect the individual, but can promote and develop the research on the individual. The group is composed of individuals, and changing the group must also be achieved by changing the individuals. However, the performance of the individual should be changed from the productivity of the entire group to meet the requirements of the group, instead of studying the individual in isolation as before. This is a new point of view, which can make the research objectives of individual physiology clearer and progress faster.

There is a certain contradiction between the group and the individual. The more dense the plants mentioned above, the fewer tillers each plant produces is an example. Moreover, after the density increases to a certain height, the more plants there are, the smaller the panicles, the fewer grains, and the more empty and瘪grains there are. In our late rice dense planting comparison test last year, planting 150,000 to 500,000 seedlings per mu resulted in 190,000 to 390,000 mature panicles, while the number of grains per panicle decreased from 73 to 44, and the percentage of empty and瘪grains increased from 12% to 26%. Within a certain range, the increase in density, the yield reduction factor of small panicles and few grains, does not exceed the increase in the number of plants, and the yield still increases; beyond this limit, the individuals will be weakened again, and the yield will decrease. Not only the panicle type is affected, but also the stem of the plant. As in the above-mentioned test, the average length of the lowest stem internode of 150,000 seedlings planted was 2.4 cm, and the diameter was 0.48 cm, while those of 500,000 seedlings planted were 3.6 cm long and 0.38 cm in diameter. Therefore, the denser the plants, the thinner and longer the stems, and the easier it is to lodge.

These examples all point out that there is a contradiction between the group and the individual, and this contradiction limits our planting density. How to unify this contradiction and maintain or improve the productivity of individuals under high density should be the direction of further research. In fact, there are indeed some high-yield fields where the density exceeds the general range, but the number of grains in the panicles does not decrease, and the stems are not weakened. We should summarize these experiences and change the law of plant growth and development by selecting and breeding varieties suitable for dense planting, make full use of the nutrients in the soil and air, strengthen the vegetative body, form more reproductive organs, and improve the ability of photosynthesis.

The above can be said to be some of our experiences in the past year or so. As mentioned, this is just a concept, and it is only a very preliminary concept. Like all new things, it is not complete enough, and even some places are not clear enough, and it must be tested by continuous practice.

We believe that this concept is generated from practice and conforms to the basic viewpoint of Marxist-Leninist dialectics. The formation of this concept will establish a new theoretical basis for plant physiology. It has already helped us clarify some production problems and pointed out the direction and ways for further research. Although the group is more complex than the individual, its laws of activity are not necessarily more difficult to analyze than the individual. Sometimes it is easier to control, because its control system is outside the body and is transmitted through the environment, so it is easier to analyze and simulate. Modern mathematics has made rapid progress in probability, statistics, information, control, operations research and other aspects. Using these thinking methods and calculation techniques to deal with group physiological activities and agricultural production measures will be a very promising research path. Up to now, the work of summarizing agricultural high yield is mostly still in the stage of description and analysis. There is no systematic and comprehensive concept to link these data together, nor has the "weight" and interrelationship of each factor and each measure been "quantified" to carry out reasonable arrangements. Only in this way can the valuable experience be affirmed and facilitated for promotion on the one hand, and the procedures of agricultural production work be gradually "quantified" on the other hand, to establish a theoretical basis for the further realization of agricultural factoryization, and to make plant physiological science more relevant to practice and improve the theoretical level.

    关于农业生产中的群体概念
    中国科学院植物生理研究所副所长　殷宏章
    1958年以来的农业生产大跃进，对科学研究工作提出了一系列新的课题。两年来在党的领导下，植物生理学工作者深入人民公社，与农民一起，在发掘和总结丰产的措施和经验中得到了很大的收获。这些收获对于开辟新的研究领域，创建新的科学理论，有重大的意义。
    群体生理与群体概念
    群体概念的逐步形成就是我们一年多以来的重大收获之一。过去我们作植物生理研究都是以植物的个体为对象，不是盆栽单株，就是几方尺的“田间试验”，或者是离体的叶片或细胞。这样累积起来的知识，当然有一定用处，但是离实践较远，很多在农业生产中用不上。有些人反而认为农业生产不过是一个技术问题，只要把对个体研究所获得的一些知识和探明的一些规律简单地加以扩大就可以了。和农民一起在大田里工作以后，才真正感觉到这种认识有很大的片面性。农业生产的目的是要求在一块土地上得到较高的产量，也就是这种作物群体的产量，而群体产量不一定是每个个体产量的无限的提高。群体虽然是由个体组成的，但有它自己的特性和发展规律，也可以说是更高一级的规律，正如同社会和个人的关系一样。因此许多植物生理的研究工作，必须从群体观点出发，把一块田看作一个有机的整体。群体有自己的结构和性能，自己的生理调节和控制能力；它受环境的影响，同时又改造了内部的环境，如田间光照度和小气候等等；它为个体所组成，同时又影响了每个个体。这些相互关系和发展规律，不是只研究个体就可以完全推测出来的。我们绝不应该把个体或群体孤立起来看，尤其是在密植的情况下，植株间的关系密切，研究个体必须考虑到它是群体的一个部分，才能了解它的作用，解决农业生产实践上的问题。
    群体生理在植物生理学中，也可以说是一个新的部门。它有点像生态学，但又不是满足于环境的分析和群落（共同生存在一起的并与一定的生存条件密切联系的生物）的组成和演替，而是把群体的生物规律与个体的生理活动结合起来，研究它们之间的相互影响，彼此的矛盾，矛盾的统一和控制的途径。目前我们对群体概念的研究还只是一个开端，必须通过实践使它逐步明确，渐次完整；更要通过总结农民的经验和学习先进科学的思想，创造新的方法和技术，使它逐步深入和提高。
    群体结构与光能利用
    群体概念是怎样帮助我们分析植物的光合作用与产量的关系问题的呢？我们都知道植物借阳光的能力，还原二氧化碳和分解水所制造的有机物是一切产品的来源。人们对于光合作用虽然作了很多的研究，对其中的物理化学的反应过程也有相当的了解，但是并没有能提出如何更充分利用阳光的办法。对农业生产过程也只是做些表面的分析，指出产量的提高，主要是由于叶面积的增加，就是说接受阳光的面积的增加。可是叶面积增加有一个限度，不能超过地面积的四至五倍，过此限度产量就不能增加，甚至下降。为什么这样？能不能提高？过去由于没有指导性的理论，无从下手。而且人们总是把上下的叶面一律看待，不管它们究竟受光多少；采取的计算办法是用总的叶面积除干物质的增加，得出所谓“光合生产率”。其实这个数量并没有什么意义，更不能代表叶子的光合能力的强弱，反而引起混乱与错觉。
    从群体来看，这个问题就很清楚，它说明用这样简化的算法是不合理的。首先，必须考虑到，在一块田中，上下层的叶面接受光的机会和数量是不同的，应该知道光的分布情况。其次也要考虑叶子的光合强度与接受的光能不是成正比例的，弱光中光合作用随光强度而增加，但有一定限度。水稻在夏天中午日光照射下只需要三分之一左右就达到饱和，光再强也用不了。生态学上用的一个方法是，把一块水稻或小麦田从上到下分成若干层，量出每层的叶面积，测完每层的光强度，计算每层叶子的光合作用，再积分得出这块田的总光和产量。这个方法比较符合实际情况，计算的结果比较接近实际产量数字，可以用来进一步分析各种措施的影响。
    整个光能利用问题显然与群体的结构有关。总的叶面积越大，吸收光也越多。究竟多大的叶面积最好呢？这就不能一概而论了，要看这个群体的结构，也就是说与每个叶子的大小，它们的排列、角度以及反光和透光的性质。譬如厚而大的叶子，水平铺着，一层就几乎把所有的光遮住，下面就不能再长。像爬山虎就是这样，叶子彼此相嵌，平铺一层，地面有多大，受光的总面积也只能有多大，这对于光能利用并不经济。如果叶子斜立起来，情况就好得多。第一：这样一个叶子受光强度弱些，但受光的面积大了，这是有利于光合作用的。第二，斜立的叶子向下投影小，遮盖下面叶子的机会少，漏过的光多，使下面的叶子更能接受光能。第三，这种叶子反光不是全向上，而是一部分向下反射到田里面，给别的叶子用，利用率最高。水稻小麦田的群体结构比较好，它们的叶片小，接近直立，因此一块地上可以容纳的总叶面积高，也就是更能密植，更能充分利用光能。
    什么样的群体结构才最合理，最能充分利用太阳光能？按理说是可以计算的，做几个适宜的假设就可以推算叶子最好多么大，应如何排列，成什么角度。但是这种计算非常复杂，每天的太阳光强度不同，角度不同，直射光与散射光也要作不同的处理。这还不如多去测定些不同的田块的结构，加以比较，或者人工制造些模型，加以研究和模拟，更容易获得结果。这样得到的群体结构与光能利用的理论，将不止对于水稻小麦有用，其他作物以及森林和自然群落，或者单细胞藻类的培养，都一样有用。
    有人要问，即使找出最合理的群体结构，用什么方法去达到这样的结构呢？这就需要更进一步的研究，下面还要谈这个复杂的问题。其实很多的农业措施和农民的经验，主要就是要达到这个目的。土、肥、水、种、密对群体结构都有影响，也都可以用来对它进行控制。譬如说有的品种叶子比较直立，有的比较平铺，从光能利用和适于密植来说，显然前者较好，因此就应作为选种的标准之一。栽植的行株距和行的方向与群体结构及光能利用有关，如天津水稻劳模姜德玉指出东西行比南北行好。水稻烤田也影响结构，我们曾看到一块田叶子生长茂盛，较平铺，并向下披，遮光很厉害，经过排水烤田，两三天中叶子就竖立起来，光分布亦大为好转。这种宝贵经验还很多。
    因此，从群体概念来分析光能利用，就给过去得到的经验数据，如叶面积与产量的关系等，奠定了理论基础。同时，改正了过去的看法上的局限性与偏差，进一步指出了再提高的可能与途径。当然，通过群体结构来提高光能利用率，只是问题的一个方面，还必须结合个体生理及光合作用的物理化学机制的研究，进一步增强每个叶片的光合能力，以提高农业产量。
    对群体来说，光只是外界环境因素之一，虽然是最重要最基本的，但还必须考虑其他的因素，如田间的温度，湿度，空气成分和风速，都能影响植物的光合作用及其他的生理活动，也都与群体的密度和结构有关。至于作物的地下部分的情况，如根与根之间，根与土壤及微生物之间的相互影响，水份和肥料的吸收等等，则更为复杂，须继续分析研究。
    群体的发展、调节和控制
    一个群体不是静止的，如同一个有机体一样，是经常在变化和发展的。因此，所谓最合理的群体结构，就必须说明是什么时候最合理。从谷粒的产量而言，应该特别注意后期的结构，也就是说从抽穗以后到接近成熟的时候。因为我们的试验证明，谷粒中的物质主要是靠这一段时期的光合作用累积的，这时利用光能多少与产量关系最大。而且这时植株已经不再生长，结构也比较稳定，同时植株很密，叶子很多，群体的影响也最大，因此在这时也就有希望达到能够充分利用光能的群体结构。
    要达到作物生长后期最合理的群体结构，就必须了解群体的发展规律和它的调节及控制的性能。一个有机体的每一个发展阶段，都受当时环境和过去历史发展的影响，同时又影响着下一阶段的发展。在整个发育过程中，一个群体在一定范围内形成一个自动调节的系统。可以通过环境的改变和人工措施，加以适当的控制，使它达到我们预期的结果。
    不妨用分蘖消长的例子来分析一下群体的发展规律。水稻或小麦都是能分蘖的，一粒种子长出一支主茎，再由主茎下部分出支蘖来，每一蘖都会再长根子，并且可能形成一个穗。分蘖数目的幅度很大，一棵“水稻王”可以生几百个分蘖，在极密的田里一棵水稻也许只有主茎成穗，没有分蘖。主茎和分蘖一起决定一块田内植株的总数，和最后的穗数，所以分蘖多少与产量有很大关系。
    由于植株在前期陆续产生分蘖，后期还有一部分死亡，所以一块田中的植株总数不是恒定的，而是经常在变化。如果我们定期去数田里的株数，就会发现它有一定的消长规律，插秧以后经过几天的返青，就可以看到株数直线上升，越稀或者越肥的田分蘖越多，上升越快，越密的上升越慢。上升的速度似与植株所占的面积成正比。过了几天，株数仍然上升，但上升的速度逐渐减小，到二十日至一个月左右株数达到最高峰，然后又开始下降。密的田中高峰达到得早些，稀的田晚些。下降的速度也是逐渐减小，到孕穗期株数接近稳定状态，不再显著增减，有的田在后期还有些回升和小的波动。株数上升的原因当然是分蘖增加，下降的原因则是部分分蘖由于遮光而致死亡。
    比较栽植密度不同的田，就可以看出几个有意义的现象。第一，植物的群体是一个很能自动调节的系统。稀植的田，分蘖多，自行增加密度；过密的田，分蘖少，或通过分蘖死亡，自然稀疏下去；最后达到比较相近的密度。譬如我们种的早稻，栽秧是每亩四十一万，八十万、一百十九万，即1：2：3的比例；到抽穗时，三块田的密度则是六十六万，九十八万，一百三十八万，接近1：1．5：2。晚稻更明显，栽秧的苗数从每亩三万至三十六万相差十二倍，而最后穗数则为十九万到三十四万，差别还不到一倍；中间的几块田从九万到二十七万苗的更为接近，最后都是二十五万穗左右。第二，正如一切自动控制的系统一样，群体调节也可以说是通过一种“反馈”作用（变化的效果又回头来影响变化本身）来进行的。这点尤其在作物生长后期自然稀疏时比较明显，植株继续增加到某种密度时，改变了环境，特别是引起遮阴，下面的植株见不到足够的光，不能维持下去，便逐渐枯死。这种“反馈”进行得比较慢，所以植株的密度必然会“冲过”最适的范围，然后再减小，并逐渐稳定下来。第三，应当指出，这些调节作用是统计性的。也就是说从整个群体看，植株消长的平均数，并不能断定每棵植物真正分蘖多少。譬如有人主张只要主茎不要分蘖，其实只是说栽种的株数与最后的株数相近，并不是说真正要每株只保留主茎而完全没有分蘖，尤其栽植不可能百分之百的均匀，植株性能也不能完全一样，总有些植株会分一两个蘖，而另一些植株连主茎也保不住。要一定不分蘖，势必种得极密，使植株保持远远低于分蘖所需要的营养面积，结果必然会有大量的主茎死亡。反过来看，有人主张稀植，使每株分蘖达到最高数量，这也同样是不合理的。因为这样势必种得极稀，总会有一部分植株未等到所有的分蘖全成长，就达到成熟，这样一定达不到最高密度，不能充分利用光能和地力。第四，在这里还可以看出，群体中植株生长的均匀度，也是一个很重要的问题。如果栽植不匀，措施不均，或品种不同，生长有参差，则生长落后低矮的植株或分蘖，将越来越跟不上，获得阳光及营养将越来越少，便会逐渐削弱以致死亡。所以有经验的农民强调选种均匀，生长一致，是有科学根据的。反之，有人倡议高矮的品种混播，以为这样可以分层利用阳光，也是不合理的想法。
    以上是一块田的植株消长规律。叶面积的消长也同它差不多。从这里我们首先可以看到，要想最后达到相当高的穗数，也就是说相当高的产量，先要密植，不能太稀，至于究竟应种多少，则幅度很大。其次，我们看到群体的生长是逐渐增加，达到最高，然后下降。最好是要它前期长得快，能早日充分利用光能，健壮植株。又不要它后期“冲”得太高，造成大量死亡。这就必须加些措施，这方面农民有许多宝贵的经验。譬如利用适宜的施肥、灌水、烤田，促进分蘖，抑制后期生长，改变群体结构，所谓“看苗施肥”，如陈永康所说的“三黑三黄”等等，都是控制的办法，需要深入分析的。必须说明，我们讲的群体的自动调节，栽植的密度很不同而最后的株数相接近，并不意味着这里已达到一个限度，譬如每亩二十五万穗，不能再提高。这只是在一个地区的一般条件下的穗数，改进了措施，选用了良种，最后的穗数还是可以提高的。
    群体与个体的矛盾与统一
    强调群体概念的意义，并不忽略个体，反而能够推动和发展对个体的研究。群体是由个体组成的，改变群体也必须通过改变个体来实现。但是要从整个群体的生产力出发来改变个体的性能，使之符合群体的要求，而不是像以前似的，把个体孤立起来研究。这是一个新的观点，它能使个体生理的研究目标更明确，进展更快。
    群体与个体之间存在着一定的矛盾。上面提到的植株愈密，每个植株的分蘖愈少，就是一个例子。而且，在密度增加到一定高度以后，植株愈多，穗子愈小，粒数愈少，空瘪粒愈多。去年我们的晚稻密植对比试验，插秧每亩十五万到五十万，成穗是十九到三十九万，而每穗的粒数则由七十三降低到四十四，空瘪粒由12％增加到26％。在一定范围内，密度加大，穗小粒少的减产因素，不超过株数加多的，产量还上升；超过这个限度，个体再削弱，产量就会减少。不仅穗型如此，植株的茎秆也受影响。即如上述的试验中，栽十五万苗的，最下一节茎秆平均长二点四厘米，粗零点四八厘米，而栽五十万苗的则长三点六、粗零点三八厘米，所以植株愈密，茎秆愈细而长，愈容易发生倒伏。
    这些事例都指出群体与个体之间存在着矛盾，这个矛盾限制了我们的栽植密度。如何使这个矛盾统一，在高密度下保持或提高个体的生产力，应是进一步研究的方向。事实上的确有些丰产田，密度超过一般范围而穗粒并不减少，茎秆并不减弱，我们应该总结这些经验，并且通过选育适宜密植的品种，改变植株生长发育的规律，充分利用土壤和空气中的营养，使营养体健壮，多形成生殖器官，提高光合作用的能力。
    以上可以说是我们一年多以来工作的一些心得。正如所说，这只是一个概念，还只是很初步的概念。同一切新生事物一样，它还不够完整，甚至于有些地方还不够明确，还须通过不断实践的检验。
    我们认为这个概念是从实践中产生，并符合于马克思列宁主义辩证法的基本观点。这个概念的形成将为植物生理学建立一个新的理论基础。它已经帮助我们阐明了一些生产上的问题，指出了进一步研究的方向和途径。群体虽然比个体复杂，但是它的活动规律，并不见得比个体的更难分析，有时反而易于控制，因为它的控制系统是在体外，是通过环境来传递的，所以比较容易分析和模拟。近代数学在概率、统计、信息、控制、运筹等各个方面，进展极速，利用这些思维方法和计算技术，来处理群体生理活动和农业生产措施，将是一个极有希望的研究道路。到现在为止，总结农业丰产的工作，大部还在叙述与分析的阶段。还没有一个系统而全面的概念，把这些资料贯穿起来，也还没有把各因素各措施的“分量”和相互关系，做出“定量”的处理，从而进行合理安排。只有这样做，才能一方面使宝贵的经验得到肯定，便于推广；另一方面把农业生产工作的程序，逐渐“数量化”，为进一步实现农业工厂化建立理论基础，并使植物生理科学更加联系实际，更加提高理论水平。
