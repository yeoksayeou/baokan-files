Chinese comrades, friends from all circles in China:
Today, the cultural circles and people from all walks of life in Beijing are holding such a grand welcome meeting for our Japanese Writers Delegation in the CPPCC Auditorium. We feel honored, and we thank you.
Thanks to the gracious invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association, we are able to visit Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, this time. First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude at this meeting. After our Japanese Writers Delegation arrived in China, we received warm welcomes in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Beijing. When we arrived at Beijing Railway Station on June 4, Mr. Liao Chengzhi, Mr. Mao Dun, Mr. Chu Tunan, and more than two hundred people from Beijing's cultural circles came to welcome us. On the 5th, a grand welcome banquet was held for us; the next day, Vice Premier Chen Yi received us at the State Council; yesterday, the entire Beijing cultural circle held a welcome meeting for us; and today, there is another grand gathering with so many people. For several days in a row, we have received warm welcomes. At these meetings, we heard speeches from the Chinese people strongly supporting and encouraging the Japanese people's struggle, and we received the Chinese literary and art circles' assistance to the Japanese cultural circles' struggle. The Chinese people have expressed deep friendship for the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Chinese people have victoriously overthrown imperialism and are rapidly building socialism. Thanks to the consistent support of the Chinese people's strength, rich in struggle experience, we firmly believe that our struggle will also be victorious.
Our Japanese Writers Delegation thanks the Chinese people for their selfless assistance and encouragement to the Japanese people's struggle. We are the first Japanese Writers Delegation to visit China during the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Therefore, we want to report to the Chinese people and friends in Beijing's cultural circles as detailed as possible about the situation of the Japanese people's struggle.
Originally, we planned to depart for China on May 10, but it was postponed repeatedly until the 30th. This was due to the changing situation in the domestic Japanese struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." On the night of May 19 and before dawn on the 20th, the Kishi Nobusuke government used completely intolerable tricks and violence, intending to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Japanese House of Representatives. On that day, the opposition parties—the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party—thought that the Liberal Democratic Party members were going to propose an extension of the Diet session. However, when the Kishi Nobusuke government proposed extending the session in the Diet, they stopped the deliberations of the Diet's Special Committee on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and decided to submit the treaty to the plenary session for a vote. The opposition party members had been fighting all along. They believed that the deliberations on this treaty were far from sufficient. They demanded that this major treaty, which is related to the fate of Japan, must be thoroughly deliberated. Opposition party members stood up to question the government. They asked: What is the scope of the so-called "Far East" in Article 4 of the treaty? Kishi Nobusuke replied: It includes Jinmen and Matsu. With this statement, the entire venue was in turmoil, and the government was unable to answer. At that time, the Paris summit was about to be held, and the American U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Union. This issue was also raised in the Diet by Socialist Party members and Communist Party members. The Kishi Nobusuke government was questioned to the point of being cornered, so it had to extend the Diet session. The Kishi Nobusuke government finally submitted the proposal to extend the session to the Diet for a vote. They intended to extend the session for a period of time in order to pass the treaty before U.S. President Eisenhower visited Japan on June 19, to show their loyalty to the United States. On this point, the opposition parties further questioned the government and opposed the extension of the Diet session. They argued that if it were to be extended, it should be extended to the maximum extent in order to thoroughly discuss the treaty.
However, just as the United States pretended to want peaceful coexistence while simultaneously sending U-2 planes to invade Soviet airspace, the Kishi Nobusuke government also deceived the people, pretending to only propose extending the Diet session, but instead convened the Special Committee on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on its own. While the opposition party members were attending the plenary session, and not many people were present at the Special Committee on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," they decided to stop deliberating the treaty and submit it to the plenary session for a vote. Then, before dawn on the 20th, they convened a plenary session, presented the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the Liberal Democratic Party unilaterally "passed" the treaty by standing vote. At this time, House Speaker Ichiro Kiyose, at the request of Kishi Nobusuke, brought five hundred policemen into the Diet, dragged and pulled the opposition party members who opposed the violent meeting out of the Diet one by one, while the Liberal Democratic Party locked themselves in a room to unilaterally "pass" the treaty. Kishi Nobusuke used the methods of Syngman Rhee in this way. When the Japanese people saw this situation, they were filled with indignation. A tide of protests swept across the country.
This is a historic juncture: will it determine that the Japanese people will be reborn, or will they be suppressed for a long time by this Kishi Nobusuke group that colludes with U.S. imperialism? Opposition party members announced: This kind of deliberation and decision-making method is not recognized. Many parties and groups—the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" Criticism Association, the National Conference to Stop the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan Literary Artists Association, the Speech and Expression Committee, the New Japan Literature Association, etc.—successively issued declarations, announcing that the Diet's vote was invalid and could not be recognized, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. This is only natural.
This matter, coupled with the introduction of five hundred policemen and the use of violence, should be deeply remembered by the Japanese people. These two things show that the so-called "passage" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," this military alliance treaty, is illegal and has no effect. According to the Japanese Constitution, the treaty will automatically come into effect thirty days after it is passed by the House of Representatives. The Kishi Nobusuke government is still planning to use this method to make the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" come into effect. But no matter how you look at it, the whole process clearly shows that it is invalid.
The Japanese people's anger swept the country, which is entirely justified.
Although it was raining on the evening of May 19, the area in front of the House of Representatives behind the Diet was filled with 30,000 people holding umbrellas, shouting slogans against the ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," "dissolve the Diet," and "down with the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet," firmly supporting the struggle in the Diet. People did not disperse until dawn.
The purpose of the Kishi Nobusuke group's use of violence in the Diet was to make the treaty automatically come into effect before Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan on June 19. However, the Japanese people clearly saw from this the crisis of Japanese democracy and the crisis of world peace, and how these two serious crises were caused. The Japanese people's anger burned more and more fiercely, and demonstrations demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet increased day by day.
On June 4, the day we arrived in Beijing, centered on the general strike of 5.6 million workers, Japanese students, cultural figures, shop clerks, and housewives victoriously launched a magnificent struggle. This victory showed that the Japanese people must solve these two crises with their own hands. They feel it is their duty, and they are determined. This time we came to Beijing, thanks to the support of the Chinese people, and were able to participate in the 17th National Unified Action of Japan.
The victory of June 4 made us feel that the entire Japan was焕然一新 (completely renewed). This is the beginning of an era of fundamental change in the entire Japan, a new starting point. The Japanese nation has found a new force to move forward bravely. This victory has enabled the Japanese people to see clearly the source of their national development.
I have introduced in more detail what happened in the Japanese Diet on May 19 and dawn on the 20th. This is because the 19th and 20th are important days, which divided the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" before and after. This was a sleepless night, the Japanese people stayed up all night listening to the radio. The people heard the news in disappointment, but when they woke up the next morning, they knew what they should do, and they stood up. The people recognized this very situation on the night of the 19th and dawn on the 20th, and they united to overthrow the vicious U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists. And the Kishi Nobusuke government also saw that the situation had changed. I think that this day is needed to divide the two stages of the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
Before this, the struggle did have many shortcomings. Of course, from the beginning, the people generally felt that they should oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This kind of thinking has been developing continuously since October 4, 1958, when Foreign Minister Fujiyama began negotiations with U.S. Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
I often go to night schools of high schools and higher commercial schools to give lectures. Last September, I went to a commercial high school in the Shonan area of Japan. On this day, the students held a debate, and I went to listen. To my surprise, the students understood very clearly what the essence of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was, and there was almost no need for me to say anything more. After the debate, I participated in their symposium. Among the nineteen faculty members of this school, eleven firmly opposed the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" from the point of view of opposing war. Night school students work during the day and go to school at night. As long as someone guides them well, they can quickly understand the problem.
I live in the Bunkyo district where the University of Tokyo is located. Nearby is the common printing factory of "Street Without Sunlight" written by Tokunaga Sunao. I participate in a literary group there - "Koishikawa Literary Association." Once a month, twenty to thirty people gather, and they publish a mimeographed publication, publishing poems, novels, and commentaries. The members are mainly workers in printing, binding, and small factories, students from the University of Tokyo, and housewives. We read several post-war novels here: "Sakurajima" by Umezaki Haruo, "Fires on the Plain" by Ooka Shohei, and "Midnight Feast" by Shiina Rinzo. We discussed the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" issue three times and participated in petitions against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Students and workers from large factories actively participated in this movement, but workers from small and medium-sized enterprises were afraid that their bosses would find out and they would be in trouble. They were very hesitant and dared not join us. They were especially afraid of people knowing that they attended such gatherings. Housewives said that they could not do whatever they wanted. Nevertheless, they gradually became aware. More and more people signed against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." In the area where I live, the only people who did not sign were the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party and the followers of the reactionary "Soka Gakkai."
I mainly talked about the situation of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" before May 20. On May 20, the Japanese people saw the very situation and stood up in anger. On the morning of the 20th, many people flocked to the Diet to protest, and they launched a fierce struggle with the police. The 16th unified action was held that evening, and people continuously went to the Diet to protest and demonstrate. The marchers held a meeting in the Hibiya Open-Air Music Hall in the rain. I also went to participate. At 6 p.m., people holding umbrellas listened to reports narrating the atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group. Speakers at the time included Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, Suzuki Ichizo of the Japanese Communist Party, and Yamamoto, Chairman of the Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee. The meeting declared: We do not recognize the Diet's resolution on the 20th, and we must carry out the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to the end, until we achieve final victory.
From that time on, the struggle has developed greatly. No one said anything good about the hideous Kishi Nobusuke anymore. Regarding the subsequent developments and ideological situation, Mr. Katsuiro Kamei and Ms. Yoko Matsuoka, permanent members of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" Criticism Association, will have detailed reports, so I won't say much here. The Japanese people see clearly from this very situation that the forced "passage" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is linked to the U.S. imperialism that launched U-2 type aircraft and undermined the summit conference.
The Japanese people have stood up. I have repeatedly said at many gatherings in China: The reason why the Japanese people have the strength to carry out the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is because the Japanese have reflected on the behavior in the last war that caused irreparable great pain to China. Today, I still have to repeat this point. Because this is the truth. This reflection deeply permeates our entire struggle. This reflection will give greater strength to the great struggle of the Japanese people in the future. I think that before I leave China, I must repeat this point every day.
Vice Premier Chen Yi said that China has suffered great disasters, pain and blows, but through this struggle of the Japanese people, China has changed its view of Japan. After the Japanese people achieve victory in this struggle, it will make Japan reborn and become a major country in Asia and a major country in the world. China does not hold the past against the past. Mr. Liao Chengzhi also said that China has forgotten the past. But when I heard these words, I said: This past can never be erased. The pain that Japan caused to China is too great too great. If there is a way to erase it, then there is only one, and that is that the Japanese people and the Chinese people must form a united front to oppose the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and overthrow it in this struggle, to erase every sin of Japan in the past. The day when these sins are erased is also the day of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The day of victory is the day when the Japanese people drive out the U.S. military, establish an independent and democratic government in Japan, and lay the foundation for true cooperation between Japan and China.
Eisenhower insisted on visiting Japan on June 19, despite the opposition of the Japanese people. It is said that Kishi Nobusuke revealed in a private letter that he would make the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty come into effect naturally before June 18. Now he is planning to have the Liberal Democratic Party pass the treaty unilaterally in the House of Councillors before this. However, the Japanese government has no confidence in whether it can protect Eisenhower at all. It is said that Eisenhower will be allowed to take a bulletproof glass car from Tokyo Haneda Airport, but this is not safe, so it is also said that a helicopter will be used to take Eisenhower from the airport to the Japanese Imperial Palace.
After the Japanese people won a major victory on June 4, they are now concentrating all their strength on opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, opposing Eisenhower, and opposing Kishi Nobusuke. From June 15 to 17, Japan will hold an even larger second general strike. 50,000 Japanese students are preparing to gather on the runway of the airport when Eisenhower arrives at Haneda Airport to prevent Eisenhower from landing. The Japanese people are determined not to let Eisenhower step on Japanese soil. The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is developing rapidly. I believe that the day of victory for the Japanese people is not far off, and the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.
Long live the victory of the struggle of the Chinese and Japanese people to form a united front against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!

    野间宏团长在首都各界欢迎日本文学家代表团大会上说
    日本人民胜利的日子不很远了中国同志们，中国各界的朋友们：
    今天，北京文化界和各界人民在政协礼堂为我们日本文学家代表团举行这样盛大的欢迎会，我们感到光荣，我们感谢你们。
    由于中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会的盛情邀请，我们这一次能够到中华人民共和国的首都北京来访问。首先，我要在这个大会上表示深深的谢意。我们日本文学家代表团到中国以后，在深圳、广州和北京接连受到热烈的欢迎。当六月四日我们到达北京车站时，廖承志先生、茅盾先生、楚图南先生以及北京文化界人士二百多位前来欢迎我们。五日，为我们举行了盛大的欢迎宴会；第二天，陈毅副总理在国务院接见了我们；昨天，整个北京文化界为我们开了欢迎大会；而今天，又是济济一堂的一个盛大集会。一连几天，都是热烈的欢迎。在这些集会上，我们听到中国人民大力支持和鼓励日本人民斗争的发言，得到了中国文艺界对日本文化界斗争的援助。中国人民对日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争表示了深厚的友情。中国人民已经胜利地打倒帝国主义，正在飞速地建设社会主义。由于得到中国人民这种富于斗争经验的力量的一贯支持，我们坚信我们的斗争也一定会得到胜利。
    我们日本文学家代表团感谢中国人民对日本人民的斗争给予无私的援助和鼓励。我们是在日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中头一个访问中国的日本文学家代表团。所以，我们想尽可能详细地向中国人民、向北京文化界的朋友们报告一下日本人民的斗争情形。
    本来，我们预定在5月10日动身来中国，后来一延再延到30日。这是由于日本国内反对日美“安全条约”的斗争形势的变化。在5月19日深夜和20日天亮以前，岸信介政府使用完全令人不能容忍的诡计和暴力，打算在日本众议院通过新日美“安全条约”。这一天，在野党——社会党、共产党、民主社会党的议员们原以为自由民主党议员是要提议延长国会会期。但是岸信介政府在国会提议延长会期进行讨论的时候，竟然停止国会的日美“安全条约”特别委员会的审议工作，决定要把这个条约提付全体会议去表决。在野党的议员在这以前一直坚持斗争。他们认为，对于这个条约的审议还很不够。他们要求，对于这种关系日本命运的重大条约，必须加以彻底审议。在野党议员起来质询政府。他们问：条约上的第四条所谓“远东”是指哪些范围？岸信介答道：包括金门和马祖在内。这一说，整个会场骚动起来，政府已经无法答辩了。当时，巴黎的首脑会议快要召开，美国的U—2型间谍飞机被苏联打下来了，这个问题也在议会上被社会党议员和共产党议员提了出来，岸信介政府被质询得走投无路了，于是不得不延长国会会期。岸信介政府终于把延长会期的提案交给国会表决。他们打算把会期延长一个时候，以便在6月19日美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本以前把条约通过，向美国表示忠诚。在这一点上，在野党又进一步质询政府，并反对国会会期的延长。他们主张，假如延长，就要最大限度地延长，以便彻底讨论这个条约。
    但是，正如美国假装要和平共处而同时又派U—2型飞机侵犯苏联领空一样，岸信介政府也欺骗人民，假装只是向国会提议延长会期，却自行召开日美“安全条约”特别委员会，趁着在野党议员都去参加全体会议，没有多少人出席日美“安全条约”特别委员会的时候，就决定停止审议条约，提付全体会议进行表决。接着，在20日天亮以前，他们召开全体会议，提出新日美“安全条约”，由自由民主党单独用起立表决的方法“通过”这个条约。这时，众议院议长清濑一郎根据岸信介的要求，把五百个警察召进了国会，把反对用暴力开会的在野党议员一个个连拖带拉地赶到国会外头去，而自由民主党自己就关在一个屋子里，去单独“通过”条约了。岸信介就这样地使用了李承晚的办法。日本人民看见这种情景，真是怒不可息。全国各地掀起了抗议的怒潮。
    这是一个有历史意义的关头：将决定日本人民是获得新生呢，还是就这样长期被这个勾结美帝国主义的岸信介集团压制下去？在野党议员宣布：对于这种审议法，这种决定问题的做法，概不承认。许多党派和团体——日美“安全条约”批判会、阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议、工会总评议会、社会党、共产党、民主社会党、日本文艺家协会、言论表现委员会、新日本文学会等都接二连三地发表宣言，宣布国会的表决无效，不能承认，并要求解散国会，岸信介内阁下台。这是理所当然的。
    这件事，加上引进五百名警察和使用暴力的事情，应当让日本人民深深记住。这两件事说明：日美“安全条约”这个军事同盟条约的所谓“通过”是非法的，是没有任何效力的。根据日本宪法的规定，在众议院通过以后三十天，条约就自然成立，就生效。岸信介政府现在还打算用这个办法叫日美“安全条约”生效。但是无论从哪一点看来也好，整个过程都清清楚楚地说明：这是无效的。
    日本人民的愤怒席卷全国，完全是理所当然的。
    5月19日傍晚虽然下着雨，但是在国会后头的众议院前面，站满了三万个拿着雨伞的人，他们高呼反对批准日美“安全条约”、“解散国会”，“打倒岸信介内阁”的口号，坚决支持议会里的斗争。一直到天亮的时候，人们都没走散。
    岸信介集团在国会里使用暴力的目的，是想在6月19日艾森豪威尔预定访问日本以前使条约自然成立。但是，日本人民却从这里清楚地看到日本民主的危机、世界和平的危机，这两个严重的危机究竟是怎样造成的。日本人民的怒火越燃越旺，要求解散国会，要求岸信介内阁下台的示威游行，一天比一天多了。
    6月4日，也就是我们来到北京的这一天，以五百六十万工人的总罢工为中心，日本学生、文化界人士、商店职员、家庭妇女，胜利地展开了波澜壮阔的斗争。这一次的胜利表明：日本人民一定要用自己的手来解决这两个危机。他们感到义不容辞，他们有决心。我们这一次来到北京，由于得到中国人民的支援，能够同样参加日本的第十七次全国统一行动。
    六·四的胜利使我们感到整个日本是焕然一新了。这是整个日本发生根本变革的时代的开端，是一个新的出发点。日本民族找到了勇往直前的新的力量。这一次的胜利使日本人民能够看清他们民族发展的力量的源泉。
    我比较详细地介绍了5月19日和20日拂晓在日本国会所发生的事。这是因为19日和20日是重大的日子，它划分了在这以前和以后的反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。这是一个不眠之夜，日本人民通宵不眠，听着收音机。人民在失望中听到了那个消息，但是，在第二天早晨醒过来的时候，他们知道自己应该去做什么，他们站起来了。人民在19日深夜和20日黎明认清了这个非常事态，他们团结起来，要打倒凶相毕露的美帝国主义和日本军国主义分子。而岸信介政府也看出现在情况变了。我认为，需要以这一天来划分日本人民反对日美“安全条约”斗争的两个阶段。
    在这以前的斗争，确是还有许多力量不足的地方。当然，从一开头，人民普遍感到要反对日美“安全条约”。这一种思想，从1958年10月4日藤山外相同美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二开始谈判日美“安全条约”以来，就不断发展起来。
    我常到高等学校和高等商业学校的夜校去演讲。去年9月，我到日本湘南地方的一个商业高等学校去。这一天，学生们开了一个辩论大会，我去旁听。使我惊奇的是，学生们谈到日美“安全条约”的实质是怎样一个东西，他们都理解得很清楚，几乎用不着我再讲什么了。辩论大会后，我参加了他们的座谈会。这个学校的十九个教职员中，有十一人从反对战争的观点出发坚决反对日美“安全条约”。夜校学生们白天工作，夜里上学，只要有人很好指导，他们是能很快理解问题的。
    我住在东京大学所在的文京区地方。附近就是德永直写的“没有太阳的街”的共同印刷工厂。我参加那里的一个文学小组——“小石川文学会”。每个月一次，有二十人到三十人集会，他们出版一种油印的刊物，登载诗歌、小说和评论。会员主要是印刷、装订和小工厂的工人、东京大学学生以及家庭妇女。我们在这里读了战后的几本小说：梅崎春生的“樱岛”，大冈升平的“野火”，椎名麟三的“深夜的酒宴”，曾经三次讨论了日美“安全条约”问题，并且参加了反对日美“安全条约”的请愿。学生和大工厂的工人积极地参加了这个运动，但是中小企业的工人害怕他们的老板知道了就不好，他们很犹豫，不敢同我们一道干。他们特别害怕人家知道他们出席这样的集会。家庭妇女则表示，她们还不能自己愿意怎么样就怎么样。虽然如此，他们还是逐步觉悟过来了。签名反对日美“安全条约”的人越来越多。我住的那一带，不签名的人只是自由民主党的把头和反动的“创价学会”的信徒而已。
    我刚才主要谈到5月20日以前反对日美“安全条约”斗争的情况。到了5月20日，日本人民看到那个非常事态，就奋然站起来了。20日早晨，许多人拥到国会去抗议，他们同警察展开了激烈的斗争。当天傍晚举行第十六次统一行动，人们连接不断地到国会进行抗议游行示威。游行队伍冒雨在日比谷露天音乐堂举行大会。我也去参加了。下午六点，手执雨伞的人们，听了叙述岸信介集团暴行的报告。当时讲话的人有社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，日本共产党铃木市藏、还有社会党国会对策委员会委员长山本等人。大会宣告：不承认20日国会的决议，我们一定要把反对日美“安全条约”的斗争进行到底，一直到取得最后胜利。
    从那个时候起，斗争有了很大的发展。再也没有人说那个面目狰狞的岸信介的好话了。关于后来的发展以及思想情况，日美“安全条约”批判会常任委员龟井胜一郎先生和松冈洋子女士将有详细的报告，我这里不多说了。日本人民从这个非常事态中，看得一清二楚，那就是，强行“通过”日美“安全条约”这件事是同开动U—2型的飞机、破坏首脑会议的美帝国主义联系在一起的。
    日本人民站起来了。我在中国的许多集会上都重复谈到：日本人民所以有力量进行反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，是出于日本人反省了在上一次大战中使中国遭到了不能弥补的极大痛苦的行为。今天，我还是不得不重复这一点。因为这是事实。这种反省深深贯穿了我们的整个斗争。这种反省今后将使日本人民的伟大斗争产生更大的力量。我想，在我离开中国以前，我必须每天重复谈到这一点。
    陈毅副总理说，中国受过很大的灾害、痛苦和打击，但是中国通过日本人民这次的斗争，改变了对日本的看法。日本人民在取得这个斗争的胜利以后，会使日本新生，成为亚洲的大国和世界大国。中国对于过去的事情不究既往。廖承志先生也说，中国已经忘记过去的事。但是我听了这些话，就说：这个过去是绝对擦不掉的。日本使中国遭受的痛苦未免太大太大了。假如有一种方法能够擦掉，那么只有一个，这就是日本人民和中国人民要结成统一战线，反对共同敌人美帝国主义，并在这个斗争中把它打倒，来擦掉日本过去的每一个罪恶。把这些罪过擦掉的日子，也就是反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。取得胜利的日子，就是日本人民把美军赶出去、建立日本独立民主政权、并奠定日本和中国进行真正合作的日子。
    艾森豪威尔不顾日本人民的反对，硬要在6月19日到日本来访问。据说岸信介在一封私信里透露，他等不到6月18日就要使日美军事同盟条约自然成立了。现在策划要在这以前由自由民主党单独在参议院通过条约。但是，日本政府对能不能保护艾森豪威尔却一点也没把握。听说要让艾森豪威尔从东京羽田机场坐防弹玻璃的轿车，但是这并不保险，于是又说要用直升飞机把艾森豪威尔从飞机场接到日本皇宫去。
    日本人民在6月4日获得了重大胜利以后，现在把全部力量集中到反对艾森豪威尔的访日，反对艾森豪威尔，反对岸信介。从6月15日到17日，日本将举行规模更大的第二次总罢工。日本学生五万人准备在艾森豪威尔到羽田机场的时候，群集在飞机场跑道上使艾森豪威尔不能着陆。日本人民下定决心，决不让艾森豪威尔跨上日本国土一步。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争正在迅速发展。我相信，日本人民胜利的日子不会很远了，日本人民一定能够得到最后胜利。
    日中两国人民结成统一战线反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争胜利万岁！
