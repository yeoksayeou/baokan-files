    Militia Heroes Angrily Bombard the "Plague God"
    Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporter Jun Fen

    During the anti-U.S. armed demonstration on the Fujian front, militia hero teams from all directions came to the artillery positions. Filled with anger at Eisenhower's war and aggression activities in climbing onto our country's Taiwan, they angrily bombarded the "plague god" together with the heroic artillerymen.

    The Xiamen frontline militia, who produced many heroes and showed great skill in the 1958 Kinmen artillery battle, once again conducted an anti-U.S. demonstration bombardment alongside the artillerymen. Huang Qingshui, deputy instructor of the People's Commune militia on the front line, led the militia of the second platoon of the first company to the front and personally served as a gunner, angrily opening fire. More than a hundred militiamen, including the famous "Twenty-Three Warriors of Linbian" and the "Eighteen Good Men," personally fired more than 3,100 shells in the "welcoming and sending off" the plague god artillery barrage. On the 17th, the heroic female militiamen of the "Ten Sisters on the Frontline" and "Eight Brave Women" and others, who were engaged in production in the fields, immediately put down their farm tools upon hearing the artillery fire driving away the "plague god." Some rushed to the artillery positions to wipe and pass shells to the artillerymen; others immediately went home to boil tea and send it to the artillery positions to quench the thirst of the brave men firing the cannons. At a certain artillery position, Lin Meiqiong, Lin Bianzhi, and thirteen other female militiamen joined the artillerymen in fiercely bombarding and "sending off" the "plague god" Eisenhower. Militia gunners raised their arms and shouted: "Comrades, fire quickly! Eisenhower came with a stiff face, we will make him go back crying!"

    Militiamen from the Dadeng, Xiaodeng, and Jiaoyu Island battlefield communes held a demonstration meeting on the 17th at the forward artillery positions, angrily denouncing the "plague god." After the meeting, militia heroes Hong Shunli and Hong Xiucao immediately led male and female militiamen to the front to fire cannons to bombard the "plague god" together with the artillerymen. Hong Xiude, the leader of the female militia artillery squad, led her entire squad to help the artillerymen wipe each large shell until it shone, and then passed them one by one to the gunners. Lin Zhaozhi, the commander of the female militia "Mulan Platoon," led a large group of "Mulans" to fire cannons shoulder to shoulder with the artillerymen, competing with each other to fiercely bombard the "plague god." They said: "Now is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. We must severely teach Eisenhower a lesson and make him remember: The Chinese people cannot be bullied!"

    The militiamen of Chenggong Township in Nan'an County—the hometown of Zheng Chenggong, the national hero who liberated Taiwan from the Dutch colonialists—have worked hard to study and train for several years, and many militiamen have become sharpshooters with a hundred hits out of a hundred shots. This time, in the anti-U.S. demonstration artillery barrage, everyone competed to go to the front. Ma Qi, the militia instructor of the Jianshe Brigade, led forty-three militiamen, carrying batches of shells to the front. Ma Qi said to the gunners: "Comrades, just fire fiercely! However much you fire, we guarantee to transport that much!" Xu Zheding, an old man in his fifties, also participated in the artillery barrage. He said angrily: "Eisenhower, this big bad guy, dares to come to our territory to engage in war conspiracies. I, the old man, must let him hear the sound of our cannons!" The old man brought six "old fighters" to the position. Others, seeing that they were old, asked them to squat in the shelters to wipe the shells, but the old man was not reconciled. They carried the shells and sent them to the gun carriages. Zhuo Wufu, the female militia battalion commander, carried eighty boxes of shells in one breath on the night of the 17th. The road was dark and slippery, and she fell, injuring the instep of her foot with a shell box. She got up and carried the shell box to the position.

    Militiamen from Weitou, Aotou, and other areas also gathered into torrents, rushing to the artillery positions to participate in the artillery barrage to drive away the "plague god." Upon hearing the news of firing on the "plague god," the student militia of Jinjiang No. 3 Middle School immediately dispatched twenty-one outstanding gunners to rush to the artillery positions. When the cannons fired in unison, the sounds of cannons and angry roars echoed together on the position. As soon as the cannon fire stopped, the majestic songs of "We must liberate Taiwan!" sung by the militiamen and soldiers loudly shook the Taiwan Strait. (Attached picture)

    Militiamen in a certain area on the front line are learning aiming techniques from Xu Changjiang, the artillery commander of a certain artillery unit. The militiamen said that they will learn their skills well and become "all-round gunners," ready to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to punish enemies who dare to launch a war of aggression against our country.

    怒轰“瘟神”的民兵英雄
    新华社前线记者　军奋
    在福建前线反美武装大示威中，前线各路民兵英雄队伍“从四面八方来到炮兵阵地，他们怀着对艾森豪威尔爬到我国台湾进行战争侵略活动的满腔怒火，和英雄炮兵一起，怒轰“瘟神”。
    曾经在1958年金门炮战中英雄辈出、大显身手的厦门前线民兵，又和炮兵肩并肩地进行了反美示威大炮击。前线人民公社民兵副教导员黄清水，带领一连二排的民兵上阵，并亲自担当炮手，愤怒地开炮猛轰。著名的“林边二十三勇士”和“十八好汉”等一百多名民兵，在“迎送”瘟神的大炮击中，亲手打出三千一百多发炮弹。17日那天，正在田野间生产的“前线十姐妹”和“八勇女”等英雄女民兵，一听到轰逐“瘟神”的炮声，连忙放下农具，有的赶到炮兵阵地上，给炮兵擦拭、传递炮弹；有的立刻回家烧好茶水，送到炮兵阵地给开炮的勇士解渴。在某炮兵阵地上，林美琼、林扁治等十三个女民兵和炮手们一起狠狠地轰“送”“瘟神”艾森豪威尔。民兵炮手们振臂高呼：“同志们快轰啊，艾森豪威尔硬着头皮来，我们就叫他哭着鼻子滚回去！”
    大?、小?和角屿三岛战地公社里的民兵，17日在前沿炮兵阵地上举行了怒斥“瘟神”的示威大会。会后，民兵英雄洪顺利、洪秀欉立刻率领男女民兵上阵，和炮兵一道开炮轰“瘟神”。民兵女炮班的班长洪秀德带领全班女民兵，帮助炮兵把大炮弹一颗颗擦拭得闪亮，又一颗颗传递到炮手手里。女民兵“花木兰排”排长林招治，带领着一大群“花木兰”们和炮兵并肩开炮，互相竞赛，猛轰“瘟神”。她们说：“现在是东风压倒西风的时代，我们一定要狠狠教训艾森豪威尔，要他记住：中国人民是不可欺侮的！”
    当年曾经从荷兰殖民主义者手中解放过台湾的民族英雄郑成功的家乡——南安县成功乡——的民兵，几年来苦学苦练，许多民兵成了百发百中的神炮手。这一次在反美示威大炮击中，个个争先上阵。建设大队民兵教导员马期带领着四十三个民兵，扛着一批批炮弹上阵。马期对炮手们说：“同志们，你们只管狠狠打，打多少，我们保证运多少！”五十多岁的老汉徐哲丁，也参加了炮击。他气呼呼地说：“艾森豪威尔这个大坏蛋，胆敢跑到我们领土上来搞战争阴谋，我老汉非叫他听听我们的大炮声不可！”这老汉带着六个“老战斗员”来到阵地上，别人看他们年岁大，让他们蹲在掩蔽部里擦炮弹，可是老汉不甘心，他们扛起炮弹就往炮床里送。女民兵营长卓乌富，17日晚上一气扛了八十多箱炮弹。天黑路滑，她跌了一跤，脚背被炮弹箱砸伤，她起来又扛着炮弹箱奔向阵地。
    围头、澳头等地区的民兵，也纷纷汇成一道道洪流，奔向炮兵阵地，参加轰逐“瘟神”大炮击。晋江第三中学的学生民兵，听到向“瘟神”开炮消息，立刻派出二十一个优秀炮手赶到炮阵地。当万炮齐放时，阵地上炮声、怒吼声响成一片；炮声刚刚停下，民兵和战士唱出的“我们一定要解放台湾！”的雄壮歌声，又洪亮地震荡着台湾海峡。（附图片）
