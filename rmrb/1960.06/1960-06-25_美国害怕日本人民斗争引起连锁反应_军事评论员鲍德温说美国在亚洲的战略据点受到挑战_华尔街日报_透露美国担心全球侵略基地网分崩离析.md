Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, New York dispatch: U.S. bourgeois military commentator Baldwin recently published an article, alarmedly claiming that the U.S.’s "setback in Japan foreshadows that the U.S.'s strategic strongholds in Asia will be challenged." He clamored that the U.S. should strengthen its interference in Japan's internal affairs.

In his article published in the "New York Times" on the 18th, he believed that the Japanese people giving warmonger Eisenhower the cold shoulder was a "Pacific crisis" for U.S. aggression policies, "a potential challenge to the U.S.'s strategic position in the West Pacific." This U.S. bourgeois strategist wrote with concern that this "is a loss of U.S. prestige...adversely affecting the U.S.'s position of strength in the world," and its "long-term consequences may cause a major shift in the balance of power in the West Pacific."

Baldwin nakedly promoted the U.S.'s aggressive deployment in the West Pacific, saying that "the U.S.'s strategic position in the West Pacific relies on the naval and air power exerted by a series of island bases extending from Alaska to the Philippines. These bases support the U.S.'s forward strongholds and the U.S.'s allies on the Asian continent." He believes that in such a chain of aggression bases, Japan occupies huge "strategic importance" because "in terms of its (Japan's) geographical relationship to the Asian continent (it faces Siberia and China), it occupies the same strategic position as the British Isles off the coast of Europe." Baldwin also talked about the U.S. using Japan and West Germany as two sources for launching wars of aggression in the East and West, emphasizing that Japan is the "West Germany of the East."

Baldwin worries that the Japanese people's resolute struggle will force "all U.S. troops to finally withdraw from Japan" and further prompt Japan to pursue an independent policy, which would "open a huge gap in the U.S.'s chain of island bases surrounding the Asian coastline," making the U.S.'s "logistical problems much more difficult" when launching wars of aggression in Asia, and the position of its two divisions of invading troops stationed in South Korea "will become far more isolated and exposed," and "the political and psychological impact of such a change will be felt throughout Asia and the West Pacific." In short, "the result will be one of the U.S.'s most devastating defeats in the 'Cold War'."

Baldwin clamored that the U.S. should strengthen its interference in Japan's internal affairs and "conduct the most careful study and analysis" of the situation in Japan. He also clamored that no matter what happens in Japan, the U.S. "will maintain the other backup positions it occupies near the Japanese mainland, including Okinawa. At the same time, the U.S. must still maintain access to the Philippines and Chinese territory of Taiwan."

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, New York dispatch: The U.S. "Wall Street Journal" recently published an article reporting that U.S. officials, facing the anti-American upsurge of the world's people, are worried that the U.S.'s aggressive military alliances and global base network established everywhere are facing "a moment of disintegration."

The article, titled "Eroding Alliances," "U.S. Fears Further Weakening of Global Treaty Base Network," "Japan Crisis May Be a Blow to All Far East Defenses," wrote: "U.S. diplomats and military leaders fear that the country is facing a severe erosion of its base system of foreign alliances - not only in Japan, but also in vast regions around the globe."

It admits that the angry tide of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle has "shocked" the U.S. ruling group, and they are worried that even if the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is finally "ratified," "the value of that piece of paper is shrinking extremely rapidly." "The U.S.'s effective use of Japanese bases may have to be written off, and will almost certainly be devalued."

The newspaper wrote: "If it loses its bases in Japan, the U.S. will have to rely much more heavily on a small Pacific island base 350 miles south of Japan—Okinawa. But this may be tantamount to relying on an increasingly fragile reed. A Pentagon officer believes: 'Friction on the Okinawa issue will be inevitable. This is old Japanese territory; leftists and nationalists are already demanding that we hand it back.'"

The newspaper wrote that what U.S. authorities are most worried about is that "the crisis in Japan will trigger a chain reaction," which will "greatly accelerate" the "erosion" process of U.S. foreign bases, which is now "mostly likely proceeding slowly." The newspaper believes that the U.S.'s linking of Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan with the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was "a tactical blunder."

The newspaper said that the U.S. "now lists Japan and other countries scattered in the East as relatively unstable defense partners. Officials are so broadly concerned about the months and years ahead that they include such remote locations as Iceland and Turkey. A Pentagon official who believes foreign bases are extremely important warned: 'We simply can't rely on all these foreign bases anymore.'"

The newspaper believes that most countries participating in the U.S.'s military bloc did so because they thought that so-called "U.S. power was immense," but after a recent series of developments, "U.S. officials say that now, the impression of this effective power has suddenly dimmed."

### 美国害怕日本人民斗争引起连锁反应  军事评论员鲍德温说美国在亚洲的战略据点受到挑战  “华尔街日报”透露美国担心全球侵略基地网分崩离析

    美国害怕日本人民斗争引起连锁反应
    军事评论员鲍德温说美国在亚洲的战略据点受到挑战
    “华尔街日报”透露美国担心全球侵略基地网分崩离析
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级军事评论员鲍德温最近发表文章，惊呼美国“在日本的挫败预示美国在亚洲的战略据点将受到挑战”。他叫嚣美国要加强干涉日本内政。
    他18日在“纽约时报”发表的文章中认为，日本人民给瘟神艾森豪威尔的闭门羹，是美国侵略政策的“太平洋危机”，“是对美国在西太平洋的战略地位的一个潜在的挑战”。这个美国资产阶级的谋士忧心忡忡地写道，这“是美国威信的丧失。……对美国在世界上的实力地位起着不利的影响”，其“长期的结果可能造成在西太平洋的力量对比的重大转变”。
    鲍德温赤裸裸地宣扬美国在西太平洋的侵略部署，他说“美国在西太平洋的战略地位，依靠从阿拉斯加延伸到菲律宾的一系列岛屿基地所发挥的海空力量。这些基地支持着美国的前进据点和美国在亚洲大陆上的盟国”。他认为，在这样一个侵略基地锁链中，日本占有巨大的“战略重要性”，因为“就它（日本）对亚洲大陆的地理关系来说（它面对着西伯利亚和中国），占有同欧洲沿海的不列颠群岛极其相同的战略地位”。鲍德温还谈到美国利用日本和西德作为在东西方发动侵略战争的两个策源地，他强调说日本是“东方的西德”。
    鲍德温担心，日本人民的坚决斗争迫使“所有的美国部队最后撤出日本”，并进而促使日本奉行独立政策，就会在美国的“包围着亚洲海岸线的岛屿基地锁链上打开一个巨大的缺口”，从而使美国在亚洲发动侵略战争时“后勤问题将变得远为困难”，它驻在南朝鲜的两师侵略军的地位“将变得远为孤立和暴露”，而“这样一种变化所产生的政治和心理影响将会在整个亚洲和西太平洋感觉出来”，总之，“结果将是美国在‘冷战’中最惨重的失败之一”。
    鲍德温叫嚣美国要加强干涉日本的内政，对日本的局势“进行最仔细的研究和分析”。他还叫嚣说，不管日本发生什么情况，美国“将保持它在日本本岛附近占有的其他后援阵地，其中包括冲绳。同时，美国仍要保持通向菲律宾和中国领土台湾的通道”。
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：美国“华尔街日报”最近刊登了一篇文章，报道了美国官员面对着世界人民反美高潮，担心美国到处建立的侵略性军事同盟和全球基地网面临“分崩离析的时刻”。
    这篇以“正在腐蚀的联盟”，“美国担心全球的条约基地网进一步削弱”，“日本的危机可能是对所有远东的防务的打击”为题的文章写道：“美国外交家和军事领袖们担心这个国家面临着它的外国联盟的基地体系——不仅在日本，而且也在全球的广大地区——的严重的腐蚀。”
    它承认，日本人民反美、反岸斗争的怒潮使美国统治集团“震惊”，他们担心，即使日美军事同盟条约最后获得“批准”，“那张纸的价值也在极其迅速地缩小”。“美国对日本基地的有效利用可能不得不勾消，而且几乎肯定将必降低价值”。
    这家报纸写道：“如果失去了日本的基地，美国将必需更加大大依靠住在日本以南三百五十英里的一个太平洋小岛基地——冲绳。但是这可能是等于依靠一根愈来愈脆弱的芦苇。五角大楼一个军官认为：‘在冲绳问题上的摩擦将是不可避免的。这是日本的旧领土；左派分子和民族主义者已经在要求我们把它交还。’”
    这家报纸写道，美国当局最担心的是“日本的危机引起一种连锁反应”，使现在“大部分可能是缓慢地进行的”美国国外基地的“腐蚀”过程“大大加速”。报纸认为，美国把艾森豪威尔预定对日本的访问同批准美日新安全条约联系在一起是“犯了策略上的失策”。
    报纸说，美国“现在把日本和其他散布在东方的国家列为比较拿不稳的防务伙伴。官员们对今后若干月和若干年的担心非常广泛，以至把冰岛和土耳其这样一些遥远的地点也包括在内。一位认为外国基地极关重要的五角大楼官员警告说：‘我们简直不能再依靠所有这些外国基地了。’”
    这家报纸认为，参加美国的军事集团的大多数国家是因为它们以为所谓“美国的力量巨大”才参加的，但是，经过最近一连串的发展，“美国官员们说，现在，这种有效力量的印象突然暗淡了”。
