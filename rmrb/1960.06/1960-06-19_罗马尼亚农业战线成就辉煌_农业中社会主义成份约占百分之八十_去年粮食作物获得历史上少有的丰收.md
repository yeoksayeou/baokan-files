Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 17th. Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party was held in December 1955, Romania has made great achievements in the socialist transformation of agriculture, in the development of agricultural production, and in construction. The task put forward by the "Second Congress" to make the socialist components in agriculture occupy a dominant position (i.e., reach 60%-70%) in terms of cultivated land area and commodity output by 1960 has been completed one year ahead of schedule. Romania's grain crops achieved a historically rare bumper harvest last year.

Currently, Romania has ensured the supply of bread, meat, fats, vegetables, and other edible agricultural products to residents, as well as the supply of agricultural raw materials needed by industry. At the same time, the state's reserves of agricultural products are constantly increasing.

As of April 1 this year, the cultivated area of socialist agriculture has accounted for 79% of the country's total cultivated area, and 78.5% of the country's farmers have joined collective farms and co-farming societies.

Under the leadership and care of the Romanian Party and state, socialist agriculture has shown great superiority. Last year, the average yield per unit area of wheat in collective farms was 40% higher than that of individual farmers, and corn was 30% higher. The cash income of collective farms has also increased year by year.

In recent years, especially after strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision last year, Romania's state-owned farms have achieved remarkable results. At present, the cultivated area of state-owned farms across the country has doubled compared with 1955. The main field work of state-owned farms has been almost entirely mechanized. In 1959, the total output of crops on state-owned farms increased by 45% compared with 1958; the number of livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep increased several times.

Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, the continuous consolidation and development of socialist components in agriculture, the rapid improvement of the material and technical level of agriculture, and the great achievements in water conservancy construction have been important factors promoting the development of agricultural production.

In the past four years, the state's investment in agriculture has reached 8.6 billion lei (Romanian currency), most of which has been used for agricultural technical equipment. By the end of this year, the number of tractors for agricultural use will reach more than 62,000, which is more than 25,000 more than the target set by the "Second Congress". Other agricultural machines have also increased significantly.

The rapidly developing Romanian chemical industry has created good conditions for the chemicalization of agriculture. Romania only produced more than 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizers in 1955, but increased to 280,000 tons last year. The amount of fertilizer used this year will increase by another 3.5 times compared to last year.

In the past two years, Romania's water conservancy work has formed a widespread mass movement. The country's irrigated area nearly doubled in just one year last year. Now, the country's irrigated area has reached 200,000 hectares, equivalent to ten times the total irrigated land managed in the two hundred years before liberation.

In recent years, with the active participation of the masses, Romania has carried out large-scale soil improvement work. Last year alone, dike construction, drainage and other work were completed on 100,000 hectares of land. This year's dike construction and drainage plan is 140,000 hectares. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to participate in water conservancy construction and soil improvement work is getting higher and higher. In 1958, only 50% of the projects were built by the masses through their own efforts, but this year it will increase to more than 70%.

Romania has made great efforts to increase grain production and has also made significant achievements in cultivating and promoting hybrid corn. Although the natural conditions last year were not very good, the country's total grain output still reached more than 10 million tons, which is a rare harvest in history. Many state-owned farms and collective farms have set high-yield records.

According to materials from the Romanian Central Bureau of Statistics, the yield per unit area of grain crops in Romania is higher than that of Western capitalist countries such as France and Austria; the grain output per capita is also increasing faster than that of countries such as the United States and France.

    罗马尼亚农业战线成就辉煌
    农业中社会主义成份约占百分之八十
    去年粮食作物获得历史上少有的丰收
    新华社布加勒斯特17日电　自从1955年12月罗马尼亚工人党举行第二次代表大会以来，罗马尼亚在农业社会主义改造、在发展农业生产和建设方面都取得了很大的成就。“二大”提出的在1960年使农业中的社会主义成份在耕地面积和商品产量方面占优势（即达到60％—70％）的任务，已经提前一年完成。罗马尼亚去年的粮食作物获得了历史上少有的丰收。
    目前，罗马尼亚已保证了对居民的面包、肉类、油脂、蔬菜和其他食用农产品的供应，也保证了对工业所需的农业原料的供应。同时，国家所需的农产品储备也在不断增加。
    到今年4月1日为止，社会主义农业的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的79％，全国78．5％的农户都加入了集体农庄和共耕社。
    在罗马尼亚党和国家的领导和关怀下，社会主义农业显示了巨大的优越性。去年，集体农庄的小麦平均单位面积产量比个体农民高40％，玉蜀黍高30％。集体农庄的现金收入也年年增加。
    近几年来，特别是在去年加强了党的领导和监督以后，罗马尼亚的国营农场取得了显著的成绩。目前，全国国营农场的耕地面积比1955年增加了一倍。国营农场的主要田间工作已差不多全部机械化。1959年国营农场的农作物总产量比1958年增加了45％；猪、牛、羊等牲畜的头数则增加了几倍。
    罗马尼亚工人党“二大”以来，农业中社会主义成份的不断巩固和发展、农业物质技术水平的迅速提高和水利建设的巨大成就，是促进农业生产发展的重要因素。
    在最近四年当中，国家对农业的投资达八十六亿列伊（罗币），其中大部分都用于农业的技术装备。到今年年底，农业用拖拉机将达到六万二千多台，比“二大”提出的指标还多二万五千多台。其他农业机器也有大量的增加。
    迅速发展的罗马尼亚化学工业为农业的化学化创造了良好条件。罗马尼亚在1955年只生产了一万多吨化学肥料，去年则增加到二十八万吨。今年使用的化肥将比去年再增加三点五倍。
    最近两年来，罗马尼亚兴修水利的工作已经形成了广泛的群众性运动。全国灌溉面积在去年一年内就增加了将近一倍。现在，全国灌溉面积已达到二十万公顷，相当于解放前二百多年中所经营的全部水浇地的十倍。
    近年来，在广大群众的积极参加下，罗马尼亚进行了大规模的土壤改良工作，单是去年就完成了十万公顷土地上的筑堤、排涝等工作。今年的筑堤、排涝计划是十四万公顷。广大农民参加兴修水利和改良土壤工作的热情愈来愈高。在1958年，只有50％的工程是群众自力兴建的，而今年将增加到70％以上。
    罗马尼亚对增加粮食生产作了很大努力，在培育和推广杂交玉蜀黍方面也作出了显著的成绩。尽管去年的自然条件并不很好，但全国粮食总产量仍然达到了一千多万吨，这是历史上少有的收成。许多国营农场和集体农庄都创造了高产纪录。
    据罗马尼亚中央统计局材料，罗马尼亚粮食作物的单位面积产量比法国、奥地利等西方资本主义国家都高；按人口平均计算的粮食产量也比美国、法国等国增加得快。
