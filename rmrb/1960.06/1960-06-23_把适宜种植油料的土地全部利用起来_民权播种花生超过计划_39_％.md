All 120,000 mu of sandy wasteland, saline-alkali, and poor land suitable for peanut planting were winter-tilled and fertilized. Various localities also started early to prepare sufficient quantities of high-quality varieties.

    多种　管好　增产油料
    把适宜种植油料的土地全部利用起来
    民权播种花生超过计划39％
    本报讯　河南省花生主要产地民权县，超额完成了花生播种任务。截至6月8日，播种花生十六万七千多亩，超过原计划39％，比去年增加了四万七千多亩。为了保证花生种得更多、更足、更快、更好，民权县委从去冬就组织各公社、大队、生产队、干部、老农、技术员，将全县所有耕地、沙荒面积进行了一次大普查、大规划、大站队，对于适宜种植花生的十二万亩沙荒、盐碱瘠薄地，全部进行了冬耕、施肥。各地还及早着手备足、备好了优良品种。
    今年，民权县发生严重干旱。为了保证花生适时播种，全县还掀起了一个趁墒抢种和抗旱播种的高潮，大大加快了花生播种进度。
    目前，全县已全面进入花生苗期管理阶段，在抗旱保苗运动中，已浇水七万多亩，中耕锄草十一万多亩，施追肥五万多亩。
