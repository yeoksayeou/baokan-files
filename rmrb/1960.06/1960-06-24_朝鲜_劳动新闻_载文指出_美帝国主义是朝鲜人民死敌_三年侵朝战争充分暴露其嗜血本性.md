Smash the US Imperialist Policy of Aggression Against Korea
    North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Carries Article Pointing Out
    American Imperialism Is the Deadly Enemy of the Korean People
    Three Years of War Against Korea Fully Exposed Its Bloodthirsty Nature
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 23rd: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article today entitled "American Imperialist Murderers Are the Deadly Enemy of the Korean People," exposing the towering crimes committed by the American aggressors in the Korean War.
    The article said that in the liberation war against American imperialist aggression, the Korean people inflicted a shameful and disastrous defeat on American imperialism, shattering the myth of American "might."
    The article pointed out that the atrocities committed by American imperialism during the Korean War fully demonstrated that American imperialism is the most vicious and bloodiest imperialism. The article said that at the beginning of the war, the US military command ordered their soldiers to say: "Kill all (Koreans) you encounter. Even if children or old people appear before you, do not be soft-hearted. You must kill as many Koreans as possible to fulfill the mission of American citizens." The process of the three-year war fully proved the bloodthirsty nature of the American wolf.
    The article said that from the first day of provoking the war to the day of the armistice, American murderers barbarously and extensively bombed peaceful cities and villages in Korea, using all kinds of killing weapons, especially in the summer of 1952, when they carried out the so-called "Bombing Week," conducting "scorched earth" bombing of seventy-eight cities in northern Korea. In three years, American imperialism dropped more than 420,000 bombs on Pyongyang alone. In three years, American beasts bombed and destroyed 8,700 factories, more than 5,000 schools, more than 1,000 hospitals and various welfare facilities in northern Korea.
    The article pointed out that American imperialism also systematically and organizedly massacred peaceful residents wherever it went. The massacre atrocities committed during its occupation of northern Korea were particularly cruel. American imperialists massacred more than 15,000 people in Pyongyang in just two months, more than 16,000 people in South Pyongan Province, and more than 100,000 people in Hwanghae Province. In total, hundreds of thousands of people were massacred in batches in northern Korea.
    The article emphasized that American imperialism inhumanely conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea. In just two months, from January 28 to March 31, 1952, they dropped more than 700 bacteriological bombs and various objects carrying bacteria in more than 400 places in northern Korea. American imperialists attempted to use bacteriological weapons to eliminate the Korean people.
    The article pointed out that all these atrocities of American imperialism fully exposed it as a cannibalistic savage and beast of the twentieth century. However, Eisenhower's visit to South Korea this time described these atrocities as "contributions to freedom."
    The article said that American imperialism used every means to massacre the Korean people, but it could not subdue them. The Korean people and their armed forces, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, defeated the American imperialists and forced them to kneel before the Korean people and sign the armistice agreement.

    粉碎美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略政策
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”载文指出
    美帝国主义是朝鲜人民死敌
    三年侵朝战争充分暴露其嗜血本性
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“美帝国主义杀人犯是朝鲜人民的死敌”的文章，揭露美国侵略者在侵朝战争中犯下的滔天罪行。
    文章说，朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的解放战争中，使美帝国主义遭到可耻的惨败，粉碎了美国“强大”的神话。
    文章指出，美帝国主义在侵朝战争中制造的暴行，充分地证明美帝国主义是最恶毒、最血腥的帝国主义。文章说，战争初期，美军司令部，命令他们的士兵说：“碰到（朝鲜人）全部杀掉。即使在你们的面前出现的是儿童或老年人，也不要手软。你们要尽量多杀朝鲜人，来完成美国公民的任务。”三年战争的过程，完全证明美国狼的嗜血本性。
    文章说，美国杀人犯从挑起战争的第一天起，到停战的那一天止，野蛮地大肆轰炸朝鲜的和平城市和乡村，使用了各种杀人武器，特别是在1952年夏天还进行了所谓“轰炸周”，对朝鲜北部的七十八个城市进行了“焦土”轰炸。三年内，美帝国主义仅在平壤就投下了四十二万多颗炸弹。三年内，美国野兽轰炸破坏了朝鲜北部的八千七百所工厂、五千多所学校、一千多所医院和各种福利设施。
    文章指出，美帝国主义在它所到之处还有计划地有组织地大批屠杀和平居民。特别是在它侵占朝鲜北部的期间制造的屠杀暴行更加残酷。美帝国主义者仅在两个月内就在平壤屠杀了一万五千多人，在平安南道屠杀了一万六千多人，在黄海道屠杀了十万多人。总共成批地在朝鲜北部屠杀了数十万人。
    文章着重指出，美帝国主义惨无人道地在朝鲜进行了细菌战。他们仅在1952年1月28日到3月31日的两个月内，就在朝鲜北部的四百多个地方投了七百多次细菌弹和带有细菌的各种物体。美帝国主义者妄图用细菌武器来消灭朝鲜人民。
    文章指出，美帝国主义的这一切暴行充分地暴露了它是二十世纪的吃人生番和野兽。但是，艾森豪威尔这次来南朝鲜却把这种种暴行说成是“对自由的贡献”。
    文章说，美帝国主义用尽一切手段屠杀朝鲜人民，但没有能够使朝鲜人民屈服。朝鲜人民和他的武装力量同中国人民志愿军一道，打败了美帝国主义者，并迫使它跪在朝鲜人民面前在停战协定上签了字。
