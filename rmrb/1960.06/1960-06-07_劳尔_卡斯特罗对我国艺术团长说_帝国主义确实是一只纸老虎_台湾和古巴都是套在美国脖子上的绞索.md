Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports, the 99 members of the Chinese Art Troupe, led by Chen Zhongjing, arrived in Havana in two groups on May 31st and June 2nd respectively. They were warmly welcomed at the airport by friends from all walks of life in Havana and representatives of Chinese overseas.

Chen Zhongjing and other leaders of the art troupe visited the "Revolución" and "Hoy" newspaper offices on the 1st and 2nd. When they visited the "Revolución" newspaper office on the 1st, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro spoke with Chen Zhongjing on the phone. Raúl said, "We are very happy to welcome the art troupe from Beijing. We greatly value the culture and friendship you bring. We care very much about the Chinese people. I extend my congratulations and respect to you, and hope to see you and the artists in person soon."

Chen Zhongjing said, "Fidel Castro and your name enjoy a very high reputation among the Chinese people."

On the morning of the 3rd, Raúl Castro received Chen Zhongjing, the head of the Chinese Art Troupe, and had a cordial conversation for one and a half hours.

During the conversation, Raúl Castro said, "Mao Zedong's analysis of imperialism is very correct, because imperialism is indeed a paper tiger." Raúl Castro also quoted Mao Zedong as saying that Taiwan is a noose that American imperialism has placed around its own neck, and the other end is held in the hands of the Chinese people. Just like the United States' policy towards Cuba, the other end of this noose is held in the hands of the Cuban people. He also wished Chairman Mao Zedong good health.

Raúl expressed his respect for the Chinese people and thanked them for their continuous support for the Cuban Revolution. He welcomed the arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe and thanked the Chinese artists for performing for the Cuban people.

Finally, Raúl Castro expressed his condolences on the death of Lin Boqu, saying that when he heard the news of Lin Boqu's death, he felt as sad as the Chinese people.

On the same day, the Chinese Art Troupe, accompanied by Cuban Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro and his wife, visited the People's Beach and agricultural cooperatives in Havana.

On the noon of the 4th, Cuban Minister of Education Armando Hart hosted a banquet for all members of the Chinese Art Troupe at the picturesque Rio Cristal Park.
