Anshan Iron and Steel, We Salute You!
	Liu Qing

	Just arrived in Anshan, I felt the top of my head was full of power lines, and under my feet were iron rails everywhere. Front, back, left, and right, countless utility poles surrounded me. I felt like I had entered a bewildering and complex world. Here, on one side of the railway, rows and groups of tall chimneys stretched for dozens of miles, the sky churning with mythical colorful clouds of smoke; the smoke constantly changing from thick to thin, and into another color. Only experienced steelworkers could understand the meaning of these changes. On the other side of the railway, ah, the car brought guests to a colorful painting, with flowers of various colors, shade trees, and Western-style houses. How clean the concrete pavement was washed by last night's rain!

	I came from Huangfu Village to pay homage to the steel capital of the motherland. On the first day, I couldn't tell the directions, staring like a fool at everything in the steel world. I wasn't just excited; to be honest, I felt a sense of mystery—how do the comrades at Anshan Iron and Steel manage such a complex steel conglomerate? But after someone led me to the mine, the ore dressing plant, the sintering plant, to the side of the blast furnace and open-hearth furnace, and to the rolling mill and steel pipe plant, I no longer felt like a guest at Anshan Iron and Steel. The motherland is vast, but wherever you go, the same revolutionary language is used. The spirits of comrades are so easy to connect with each other, as if visiting the home of a brother, and you can understand each other's feelings in just a few words.

	The magnificent buildings of the factory, the complexity and enormity of the machines, the thrilling roars, and the solemn labor of the workers are the first things that shock people. Walking through the hundreds of meters long houses, a visitor who has lived in the countryside for a long time, bows his head and admires the strength and power of the working class from the bottom of his heart. When the gong and drum-beating news reporting team walks past the rolling mill, I feel like I am watching the news reporting team of the rural commune's production team walk past my door, so familiar! The pulse of a country is truly like the pulse of a person, beating consistently in all parts of the body. Workers and farmers, when they leap forward, have the same spirit!

	The upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution is changing the face of Anshan Iron and Steel. Everywhere you hear people talking about many technical issues that I don't understand. The huge waves of competition are stirring people's hearts. I was stunned by the amazing examples of how many times the work efficiency has been increased and how many times the labor force has been saved. Invention and creation have now turned from the affairs of a few "smart people" into a massive mass movement. We are already living in such a glorious era: hundreds of millions of ordinary laborers are using their brains to solve problems that a limited number of scientists cannot solve. The masses are sages!

	The guide went to the office building to find someone from the factory director's office, and I stayed on the road. Under a locust tree not far away, three people were engaged in a heated debate. I listened attentively. Two people were trying to persuade one person. That person seemed quite stubborn. Yes, he did not believe in an innovation plan of his partners. Unfortunately, I don't know their specific positions. I also don't understand the issues they are arguing about. But I can see that one of them is very excited and speaks very directly:

	"Comrade! Go! Let's do it and see; if we fail, let's do it again!" With that, the three people walked away together.

	Good! Right! We should treat work with this attitude. Even if you fail, even if you fail again and again, it doesn't matter: each failure brings you closer to success. The invention and creation of science and technology and literature and art are all completed from constant practice. Take mankind's discovery, popularization, and improvement of thermal energy, for example, it has gone through fire, steam, electricity, and now to the era of atomic energy. Of course, we respect our predecessors for inventing fire under their conditions, which was a great contribution in the era without fire. But we must never insist on using fire as thermal energy under our conditions in order to respect our predecessors. We must innovate, and we must create. After visiting Anshan Iron and Steel for three days, this point gave me the deepest and most concrete inspiration. Closely link with the masses! You will create miracles! You must neither be arrogant and conceited, nor burn incense and kowtow. The Chinese proletariat's method of mastering this steel conglomerate is a good example for us!

	Someone asked: What impressed you most about Anshan Iron and Steel? Answer: It is the photos of advanced producers in front of every factory, those four-inch, six-inch, and eight-inch single or group photos in glass frames. Dear elderly, middle-aged, young people, men and women, how many thousands, or even tens of thousands, are these photos posted in the entire city of Anshan? This is truly exciting; they are the representatives of the spirit of Anshan Iron and Steel. Every time I come out of a factory, I have to spend some time admiring their honest, brave, firm, and humble faces one by one. Some of them are people I just said goodbye to in the factory. They are so simple and ordinary, and when you are with them, you can only feel intimacy and encouragement, and you will never feel condescending or arrogant. Comrades who come to visit in the thousands and tens of thousands, let us learn from their way of being, and bring their spirit to the places where we work!

### 鞍钢，向你敬礼！

    鞍钢，向你敬礼！
    柳青
    刚到鞍山，觉得头顶上全是电线网，脚底下到处是铁轨，前后左右，无数的电杆包围了我。我感到进入了一个令人迷惘的复杂世界。在这里，铁路的一边，成行的、成群的高烟筒，连绵几十里，天空翻腾着神话般的五彩烟云；烟云不断地变浓、变淡、变成另外一种颜色，只有老练的钢铁工人，才能明白这些变化的意思。在铁路的另一边，好，汽车把客人送到一幅彩色的画图中来了，各色的花朵、林荫、洋房，昨晚的阵雨把混凝土路面洗得多么干净啊！
    我从皇甫村来朝拜祖国的钢都。第一天，我分不清楚东西南北，傻子一般望着钢铁世界的一切。我不光是兴奋，说实话，我感到神秘——这样复杂的钢铁联合企业，鞍钢的同志们怎样摆弄得呢？但当有人领着我到过矿山，到过选矿厂，到过烧结厂，到过高炉和平炉旁，到过轧钢厂和钢管厂以后，我就再也不觉得我是鞍钢的客人了。祖国很大，但无论到那里，都使用共同的革命的语言。同志们彼此的精神是这样容易接近，好像到兄弟的家里一样，几句话就可以体会对方的心情。
    工厂的宏伟建筑，机器的复杂和庞大，惊心动魄的巨响和工人同志们庄严的劳动，是首先震撼人的。在几百米长的房子里走过去，长期住在农村的来朝者，俯首从心里敬佩工人阶级的强大有力。当敲锣打鼓的报喜队从轧钢机旁走过来的时候，我又好像看着农村公社生产队的报喜队从我家门前走过去一样，那么熟悉啊！一个国家的脉搏真和一个人的脉搏一样，在机体各部分，跳动是一致的。工人和农民，跃进起来是一个神气！
    技术革新和技术革命的热潮正在改变鞍钢的面貌。到处听见人们谈论我不懂的许多技术问题。竞赛的巨浪激荡着人心。我被工效提高多少倍、劳力节约多少倍的惊人事例，弄得目瞪口呆了。发明创造，从少数“聪明人”的事情，现在变成声势浩大的群众运动了。我们已经生活在这样一个光辉的时代：千百万普通劳动者动脑筋，解决人数有限的科学家解决不了的问题了。众人是圣人！
    向导进办公楼去找厂长办公室的人去了，我留在马路上。在旁边不远的一棵槐树底下，三个人正在进行热烈的辩论。我聚精会神听着。是两个人在说服一个人。那个人，看来相当固执。是的，他不相信伙伴们的一个革新计划。可惜，我不知道他们的具体职务。他们争论的问题，我也听不明白。但我看出来了，其中有一个人很激动，说话非常地直撞：
    “同志！走！我们做一做看，失败了另来嘛！”说着，三个人一齐走了。
    好！对！应当用这样的态度对待工作。即使失败了，即使一次又一次地失败了，也不要紧：每一次失败离成功愈近。科学技术和文学艺术的发明和创造，都是从不断的实践中完成的。拿人类对热能的发现、普及和提高来说吧，经过火、蒸汽、电，现在到原子能的时代了。我们当然尊重我们的前人在他们的条件下发明火，这在没有火的时代，是很大的贡献。但我们绝不能为了尊重前人，就在我们的条件下还坚持用火做热能。我们必须革新，必须创造。在鞍钢参观了三天，这一点给我最深刻、最具体的启发。紧密联系群众吧！你将要创造奇迹！你既不要高傲自大，也不要烧香叩头。中国无产阶级掌握这个钢铁联合企业的方法，是我们的好榜样！
    有人问：鞍钢给你印象最强烈的是什么？答：是每一个工厂门前先进生产者的照片，那些装在玻璃框里的、四寸的、六寸的、八寸的单人或集体照片。亲爱的老年、中年、青年、男人和女人的照片呀，在全鞍山市内贴起来几千？还是几万呢？这真是令人激动，他们是鞍钢精神的代表者。我每从一个工厂出来，都要花点时间一位一位敬慕地看他们诚实、勇敢、坚定、谦逊的面容。其中有些人是我在厂子里刚刚告别的。他们是那样的朴素、普通，和他们在一块，你只能感到亲切、鼓舞，绝不会感到居功骄傲、盛气凌人。成千成万来参观的同志们，让我们学习他们的为人，把他们的精神，带到我们工作的地方去吧！
    鞍钢！向你敬礼！（附图片）
