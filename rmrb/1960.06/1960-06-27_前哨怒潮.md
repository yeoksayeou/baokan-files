    Outpost of Seething Anger
    By our reporter Chen Qitong
    Recently, I traveled through lush fields to visit He厝 Village, a heroic village on the forefront of our nation’s sea defense. For ten years, this village has suffered severe devastation from American-made bombs. Every house, every tree, every rock, every inch of land is etched with the bloody crimes of the American imperialists. However, the people of this heroic village were not intimidated by the ferocious flames of American imperialism. Instead, bearing new and old hatreds, they have unleashed a surging tide of anger against the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and are determined to liberate Taiwan. In upholding the support for the front, maintaining production, and strengthening the struggle against the enemy, they have created many moving deeds and produced many heroic models, fully demonstrating the Chinese people’s unyielding will to liberate Taiwan, resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression, and defend world peace.
    He厝 Village stands on the forefront of Xiamen Island, separated by only a strip of water from Jinmen Island, which is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Since June 1950, when American imperialism launched the Korean War and forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, this area has frequently been subjected to frantic attacks by American-made artillery shells. Several tens of thousands of shells have fallen on this land, which is only a few square kilometers in size, and more than a thousand of the village's four thousand houses have been destroyed by artillery fire. Huang Mayuan, Huang Yingke, and the pregnant He Zhouyu, along with four other residents, who were peacefully working, were killed by American-made shells one after another, and He Shuiquan and five other residents were wounded. However, blood debts must be repaid with blood. The three thousand peace-loving residents of He厝 Village, amidst the frantic attacks of American-made artillery shells, universally mobilized, regardless of age or gender, and, with an irreconcilable hatred for American imperialism, roared, "We must liberate Taiwan, resolutely oppose American aggression, and never give up until we achieve our goal!" They fully supported the People's Liberation Army, resolutely gave the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who were acting as accomplices, a heavy blow, and fought day and night for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of world peace. In the autumn of 1958, during the fierce battle of shelling Jinmen, the village's militia and commune members effectively supported the People's Liberation Army and achieved the world-shaking victory of shelling Jinmen with ten thousand cannons, striking a blow against the aggressive flames of American imperialism. In adhering to the support for the front and maintaining production, nine heroic model units, including the nationally renowned "Ten Sisters of the Front," "Little Eight Route Heroes," "Seven Grandmothers of He厝," and "Ten Militia of the Front," as well as more than one hundred meritorious models, emerged.
    Recently, the head of American imperialism, Dwight D. Eisenhower, traveled to the Far East on a robber's journey and even went to Taiwan once again to plot new war conspiracies and make a shameless provocation against the Chinese people. The people of heroic He厝 Village feel an accumulation of old and new hatred, and cries of "Beat the plague god" resound everywhere. They rushed to the front lines from all directions to cooperate with the heroic artillery and hold an anti-American armed demonstration. Huang Qingshui, deputy secretary of the Party branch, who, for ten years, has found it difficult to lead fishermen freely in the Taiwan Strait to chase schools of fish due to the blockade and sabotage by American and Chiang Kai-shek warships, immediately led a platoon of militia to the front lines as soon as he heard the artillery fire, cooperating with the gunners to fire the cannons. While shouting, "Eisenhower, roll back, fire the cannon!" and "For the liberation of Taiwan, fire the cannon!" Huang Qingshui picked up artillery shells weighing dozens of kilograms and stuffed them straight into the gun bore, loading thirty-nine shells in one go. He Shuiquan, the militia company commander whose leg was wounded by an American-made artillery shell, also rushed to the front lines in three steps and two, taking turns serving as ammunition handler, loader, and breech operator, cooperating with the heroic gunners to fire more than sixty shells at the designated target in one breath.
    The people of heroic He厝 Village, not only use their anger and strength to fully support the People's Liberation Army in fiercely striking the enemy during artillery battles, but also, regardless of wartime or peacetime, day or night, persist in guarding and patrolling, vigilantly defending the nation's sea defenses and highways, warehouses, and bridges, casting a dragnet in the front-line areas, making it difficult for American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents to move an inch. One morning, an armed secret agent specially trained by an American intelligence agency attempted to land secretly in He厝 Village under cover of the morning mist. However, before this American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agent could clearly see the scenery on the coast, he was captured, along with his gun, by Huang Baohu, who was awarded the title of "Ten Militia of the Front."
    In order to bring light and hope to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers enslaved and harmed by the American aggressors, as well as the compatriots on the enemy-occupied islands, the heroic militia of He厝 Village also overcame all kinds of difficulties and distributed tens of millions of leaflets introducing the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist construction and showing the determination of our compatriots to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu to the islands of Great and Little Jinmen and other islands. On one occasion, militia instructor He Yang, along with three militiamen, including He Yongchuan, took advantage of a pitch-black night to go to Jinmen to distribute leaflets. As they were sailing downstream near Great Jinmen, they were suddenly discovered by a Chiang Kai-shek patrol boat. The cunning enemy immediately slowed down, lowered the engine noise, and stealthily pounced on them. However, the enemy's conspiracy was discovered by the bold and careful militia. They listened to the approaching engine noise of the enemy boat from the water, calculated the distance of the enemy boat, quickly released all the leaflets, turned the boat around, passed through the rapids, and safely returned to the starting point. The enemy boat and the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the island, who had missed their target, turned on searchlights and fired cannons, and the triumphant militia couldn't help but laugh and say, "Just take the gifts, no need to fire cannons and turn on lights to send us off."
    To persist in supporting the front and maintaining production in the front-line area under the frequent attacks and sabotage of American-made Chiang Kai-shek artillery shells, there are many unimaginable difficulties. However, under the wise leadership of the Party and with the help of the People's Liberation Army front-line troops, the people of heroic He厝 Village, relying on the collective strength of the organized collective, overcame all difficulties with tenacious and intelligent labor, making production a bumper harvest every year. Now, after cooperating with the heroic artillery in shelling the "plague god" Eisenhower, the heroic militia and commune members of He厝 Village are enthusiastically launching a production competition to seize a bumper summer harvest in field management and expand vegetable planting, determined to use practical actions such as strengthening the struggle against the enemy and strengthening production to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, the opposition of American imperialist aggression, and the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

    前哨怒潮
    本报记者　陈启桐
    日前，记者穿过繁茂的田野，访问了祖国海防前哨的何厝村。这座英雄的村庄，十年来，曾经遭受美国制造的炮弹的严重摧残，每座房屋、每株树木、每块岩石、每寸土地，都刻记着美国侵略者的血腥罪行。但是，英雄村庄的人民，不但未被美帝国主义的侵略凶焰所吓倒，而是带着新仇旧恨，一浪高过一浪地掀起了反对美帝国主义侵略罪行、坚决解放台湾的怒潮。在坚持支前、坚持生产、加强开展对敌斗争中，创造了许多可歌可泣的事迹，涌现了许多英雄模范，充分显示了中国人民一定要解放台湾、坚决反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平的不屈不挠的意志。
    何厝村屹立在厦门岛的最前沿，与蒋军盘踞的金门岛只有一水之隔。从1950年6月美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争、武装霸占我国领土台湾以来，这里就经常遭受美制炮弹的疯狂袭击，在只有几平方公里的土地上，先后落下了几万发炮弹，全村四千多间房屋，有一千多间毁于炮火。正在从事和平劳动的黄马愿、黄盈科和孕妇何周玉等七个居民，先后被美制炮弹打死，何水鐉等六个居民，先后被打伤。但是，血债必须用血来偿还。热爱和平的何厝村三千多名居民，就在美国制造的炮弹疯狂袭击下，不分男女老少普遍动员起来，带着对美帝国主义不共戴天的仇恨，发出了“一定要解放台湾，坚决反对美国侵略，不达目的决不罢休”的怒吼，全力支援人民解放军，坚决给予为虎作伥的蒋匪军以沉重打击，日日夜夜为解放台湾、保卫世界和平而斗争。1958年秋季，在炮轰金门的激烈战斗中，全村民兵和社员有力地支援了人民解放军，取得了震动世界的万炮轰金门、打击美帝国主义侵略凶焰的辉煌胜利。在坚持支前、坚持生产中，出现了名闻全国的“前沿十姐妹”、“英雄小八路”、“何厝七大娘”、“前线十民兵”等九个英雄模范单位，以及一百多个功臣模范。
    最近，美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔到远东来进行强盗旅行，竟然再一次到台湾去策划新战争阴谋，向中国人民进行无耻的挑衅。英雄的何厝村人民更是旧恨加上新仇，到处响起了“揍瘟神”的喊声，从四面八方赶到阵地上，配合英雄的炮兵，举行反美武装大示威。十年来，由于美蒋军舰的封锁破坏，难于带领渔民自由驰骋在台湾海峡追捕鱼群的党支部副书记黄清水，一听到炮声，立即带领了一个排的民兵赶到阵地上，配合炮手们打炮。黄清水一面高呼着：“艾森豪威尔滚回去，开炮！”、“为解放台湾，开炮！”一面搬起几十公斤重的炮弹，直往炮膛中塞去，一口气就装填了三十九发炮弹。腿上被美制炮弹打伤的民兵连长何水鐉，也三脚两步地赶到阵地上，轮番担任弹药炮手、装填炮手、开闭炮手，一口气就配合英雄炮手们把六十多发炮弹打到预定的目标上。
    英雄的何厝村人民，不仅在炮战时，用他们的愤恨和力量，全力支援人民解放军狠狠打击敌人，同时还不分战时和平时、白天和黑夜，坚持放哨巡逻，警惕地守卫着祖国的海防和公路、仓库、桥梁，在前线地区撒下天罗地网，直叫美蒋特务寸步难行。有一天清早，有个美国特务机关专门训练的武装特务，借着晨雾的掩护，妄图在何厝村潜行登陆。但是，当这个美蒋特务还没有看清海岸上的景物的时候，就被荣获“前线十民兵”称号的黄保护等连人带枪俘获了。
    为了把光明和希望带给在美国侵略者奴役和残害下的蒋军官兵，以及敌占岛屿上的同胞，英雄的何厝村民兵，还战胜了种种困难，把上千万份介绍祖国社会主义建设辉煌成就，显示祖国同胞解放台、澎、金、马决心的传单，散发到大、小金门等岛屿上去。有一次，民兵指导员何养，带着何永川等三个民兵，利用伸手不见五指的夜晚到金门去放传单，当他们刚刚顺流驶到大金门附近时，突然被一艘蒋军巡逻艇发现了。狡猾的敌人立即放慢了速度，降低了马达声，偷偷地向他们扑来。但是，敌人的阴谋诡计，早被胆大心细的民兵发现了，他们靠着船舷一边听着从水中传来的越来越近的敌艇马达声，计算着敌艇的距离，一边迅速放完了传单，掉转了船头、穿过激流，向出发地点安全返航。害得扑空了的敌艇和岛上的蒋军又打探照灯又打大炮，胜利凯旋了的民兵不禁欢笑地说：“让你们好好收下礼物就是了，不用放炮打灯欢送了。”
    要在美制蒋军炮弹经常袭击破坏下，坚持在前线地区支前和生产，有着许多难以想像的困难。但是，英雄的何厝村人民，在党的英明领导下和人民解放军前线部队帮助下，依靠组织起来的集体力量，用顽强而又智慧的劳动，克服了一切困难，使生产年年丰收。现在，英雄的何厝村民兵和社员，在配合英雄的炮兵，炮轰“瘟神”艾森豪威尔之后，正热火朝天地掀起了夺取夏季大丰收的田间管理和扩种蔬菜的生产竞赛，决心用加强对敌斗争、加强生产等实际行动，为解放台湾、反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争到底。
