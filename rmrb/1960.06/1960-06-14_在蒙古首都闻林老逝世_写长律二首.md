On Hearing of Comrade Lin Lao's Death in the Mongolian Capital, Two Lengthy Poems
Chen Yi
	The Beijing obituary arrives, a dim shadow,
	Old friends will never meet again from now on.
	A lifetime of revolution, without a hint of shame,
	The correct line marks a hero.
	The Long March walked past the moonlit mountains,
	In his later years, his poems sang of the Great Leap Forward's red.
	A visit to Mongolia leaves behind friendship,
	Here, we mourn with sorrow.
	Doubt if it's real, doubt if it's a dream, things are hazy,
	Vaguely, it seems we're meeting for a game of Go again.
	Discussing politics and weighing writing, now past events,
	Accompanying on tours and urging poems, remembering his voice and appearance.
	Throwing himself into revolution, unafraid of hardships and dangers,
	Facing negotiations, fighting the evil dragon.
	Seventy-five years of age now come to an end,
	How many share his refined literary talent?

    在蒙古首都闻林老逝世
    写长律二首
    陈毅北京讣到影瞳瞳，故旧从今不再逢。革命一生毫不愧，路线正确是英雄。长征走步关山月，晚岁诗吟跃进红。访问蒙古留友谊，此间吊唁悲哀同。疑真疑梦事朦胧，恍惚围棋又相逢。论政衡文成往迹，伴游催诗记音容。投身革命轻艰险，面对谈判战恶龙。七五高龄今结束，风流文采几人同。
