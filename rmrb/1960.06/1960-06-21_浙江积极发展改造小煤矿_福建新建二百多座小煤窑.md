Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Zhejiang Province is vigorously carrying out a mass movement of small-scale, indigenous and modern coal industries, greatly accelerating the development of the coal industry.

This year, more than twenty counties (cities) and more than fifty people's communes across the province have built hundreds of small coal kilns, increasing the production of large quantities of coal for the state.

In order to accelerate the construction of small coal mines and increase the output of raw coal, industrial departments at all levels have also carried out technical transformations of existing small coal kilns. In terms of mining, advanced tools such as hand drills, foot-operated drills, and hanging drills have been widely promoted in various places, and advanced coal mining methods such as horizontal layering and inverted steps have been implemented, thereby greatly increasing the output of raw coal. In terms of lifting and transportation, wooden winches have been widely used in mines in various places, realizing rail car transportation and cableway transportation, eliminating manual lifting and carrying, and saving a lot of labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: In the past month, counties and people's communes in Fujian Province have newly built more than 250 small coal kilns.

Longyan County built 30 new small coal kilns in January, basically realizing the "small iron plant, small mine, small coal mine" three-small complete set. Half of the brigades in the Chengguan Commune of this county have established small coal mines, which not only guarantees the fuel needed for commune-run iron plants, lime plants, and building materials plants, but also transfers some coal to support Zhangzhou, Xiamen and other cities. Chong'an County, which originally had no coal mines, organized more than 12,000 people to climb mountains and wade through rivers, and found more than 80 coal mines in the county in half a month, and immediately established 15 small coal kilns. Due to the large-scale development of small coal kilns in various places, more than a quarter of the province's total coal output is currently produced by small coal kilns.

    浙江积极发展改造小煤矿
    福建新建二百多座小煤窑
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省各地大搞煤炭工业小土群、小洋群运动，大大加速了煤炭工业的发展。
    今年全省已有二十多个县（市）和五十多个人民公社，新建了几百个小煤窑，为国家增产了大量的煤炭。
    为了加速小型煤矿的建设，提高原煤产量，各级工业部门还对现有小煤窑进行了技术改造。在采掘方面，各地普遍推广了手摇钻、脚踏打眼、吊式打眼等先进工具，并且推行了水平分层、倒台阶等先进采煤法，因此大大提高了原煤的产量。在提升和运输方面，各地矿井已普遍使用了木制绞车，实现了轨道车子化、索道化，消灭了人力提升和人抬肩挑，节约了大量劳动力。
    据新华社福州电　福建省各县和人民公社，最近一个月来新建了二百五十多个小煤窑。
    龙岩县在1月之间新建了三十个小煤窑，基本上实现了“小铁厂、小矿山、小煤矿”三小配套。这个县的城关公社有半数的大队都建立了小煤矿，不仅保证了社办铁厂、石灰厂、建筑材料厂需要的燃料，还调出一部分煤支援漳州、厦门等市。原来没有煤矿的崇安县，组织一万二千多人登山涉水，半个月全县就找到了八十多处煤矿，并立即建立了十五个小煤窑。由于各地大办小煤窑，目前全省煤的总产量中有四分之一以上是小煤窑生产的。
