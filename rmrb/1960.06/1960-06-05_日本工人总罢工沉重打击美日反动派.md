Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Tokyo dispatch: Supported by people all over the country, 5.6 million Japanese workers launched a massive general strike across the country at 4:00 AM this morning, demanding the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The trains at Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Okayama, Shizuoka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Sapporo stations belonging to the National Railway Workers' Union were all stopped on time. The Kyoto bus union and Yokohama port sailors also went on strike at the same time. Employees of telecommunications, postal services, iron and steel, coal, hardware, shipbuilding, shipping, chemicals, printing, banking, etc., belonging to "Sohyo" all participated in the general strike. According to announcements from "Sohyo" and the Federation of Independent Unions: The number of workers participating in today's national general strike has reached 5.6 million, including 3.6 million members from 57 industrial unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and 1 million members from 19 industrial unions of the Federation of Independent Unions.

The main force of this general strike, the National Railway Workers, has already achieved initial victories. All trains and streetcars on all lines of Tokyo Station have been completely suspended from the first train. From early this morning to 7:00 AM, most of the traffic in Tokyo was paralyzed.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to issue administrative orders and instruct the police to obstruct and sabotage the "National Railway" workers' strike ultimately failed. The "National Railway" authorities' attempt to kidnap drivers and force them to drive also failed. In order to support the "National Railway" workers' strike, about 30,000 workers from various industries in Tokyo organized themselves from late last night to go to major stations and set up picket lines. 20,000 students guarded the major stations all night, preventing the sabotage and suppression by the police authorities.

12,000 employees of the 49 branches of the Tokyo Central Post Office participated in the general strike this morning by holding workplace rallies.

This morning's Tokyo was filled with a fighting atmosphere. Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nosaka Sanzo, General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji, Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General Eda Saburō, and Diet members from both parties all went to various gathering places in Tokyo to encourage the workers' strike. Workers and students sang progressive songs, boosting the morale of the "National Railway" workers. In Nagoya, about 5,000 workers, students, and ordinary citizens entered the station to support the railway workers' strike, which prevented trains on the Tokai Railway, a major Japanese trunk line, from departing on time.

Workers from 23 private railway companies in the Kansai region also held strikes from the first train until 7:00 AM.

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Tokyo dispatch: Japan's unprecedented June 4th general strike achieved brilliant success today. In this anti-American patriotic struggle, Japanese workers and people from all walks of life further strengthened their unity, raised their awareness, severely hit the US-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to conclude the US-Japan military alliance, and deepened the crisis of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Today, the streets of Tokyo presented a magnificent scene of struggle. A striking giant banner was hung above the Tokyo Central Post Office Building. It read: "Long live the workers' general strike to stop the revision of the Security Treaty!" The balloon floating in the air read: "Stop the ratification of the new Security Treaty, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet!"

From 4:00 AM, all trains, streetcars, and buses were suspended from the first train. With the support of students, women, and people from all walks of life, railway workers completely controlled Shinagawa Station, the Tokyo railway hub. Tokyo Station, known as the "Gate of Japan," was completely closed before 7:00 AM today. The slogans of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and abolishing the US-Japan military alliance treaty shook the earth. "Kyodo News" said, "The main stations in Tokyo are flooded with red flags."

Japanese Communist Party Diet member Shiga Yoshio appealed to the striking workers, hoping that they would continue the struggle to prevent Eisenhower from visiting Japan. Workers and students responded with thunderous applause when he spoke.

Socialist Party member Tanaka Minoru told the students participating in the struggle that if Kishi Nobusuke does not resign immediately, it will be difficult for him to avoid the fate of Menderes and Syngman Rhee...

Near the workers' strike picket lines at various stations in Tokyo, one could see famous professors, poets, painters, and actors. They stayed with the workers all night, supporting and encouraging the workers' strike. Poet Sumako Fuko, Professor Takeuchi Yoshimi, painter Taro Okamoto, scholar Tsurumi Shunsuke, monk Saikawa Keibun, and others all participated in the ranks of this struggle.

After the workers of the Tokyo National Railway Workers' Union successfully ended their strike at 7:00 AM as originally planned, the public corporation workers launched a strike. Workers from 49 branches of the Tokyo Central Post Office held a two-hour strike from the beginning of their work hours this morning. The delivery of letters in Tokyo was completely suspended. Matsumoto Kunio, the youth minister of the Central Post Office Union, emphasized that postal workers had finally successfully launched a political strike.

The Tokyo streetcar workers and public bus workers, who were considered to have relatively weak fighting power in the past, also held a two-hour strike this morning. A young postal worker said that he had joined hands with the streetcar and bus workers for the first time since participating in the struggle.

At the same time, the National Electrical Communications Workers' Union carried out an hour of strength struggle in 1,500 bureaus. Teachers' union members held an hour-long workplace rally from the beginning of work hours today. After this, central and local government employees left their workplaces and held rallies, and passed resolutions to "overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and dissolve the Diet."

Workers from private enterprise unions such as the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, and the Fukuoka Construction Workers' Union also held scheduled strikes.

According to "Kyodo News," railway workers deployed picket lines at stations in Hiroshima, Okayama, Sapporo, and other places, and trains were either suspended or delayed. It said: "It seems that these passenger cars will not be able to fully restore the normal schedule until midnight today, and freight cars will not be able to fully restore the normal schedule until tomorrow."

This general strike has strongly impacted the Japanese ruling class. "Kyodo News" said, "The national reaction to the unified action and this struggle of strength will have a significant impact on the political situation in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji called on workers, students, and citizens to strengthen unity and fight to the end when he spoke to railway workers participating in the general strike in Tokyo this morning.

Miyamoto emphasized that the entire Japanese people are currently firmly united under the banner of the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty." He said that if we further launch mass movements, we will severely strike the traitorous reactionaries. He said that it is possible to establish a temporary coalition cabinet of various parties, excluding the Kishi Nobusuke group, to preside over the general election. Miyamoto expressed his respect to the railway workers who are launching an unprecedented general strike in Japanese history and to the workers and students who went to support the strike.

Miyamoto emphasized that the entire Japanese people have stood up, not only workers, but also university professors and students, which marks that this struggle is a patriotic and just struggle. At the same time, Socialist Party Diet member Sasaki Kozo and Japanese Communist Party member Shiga Yoshio also spoke to striking railway workers and workers and students supporting the strike in front of Tokyo Station this morning.

    岸信介政府发布行政命令和指使警察阻挠和破坏“国铁”工人罢工的阴谋终归于失败。“国铁”当局掳走司机强迫他们开车的阴谋也未得逞。为了支援“国铁”工人罢工，东京各行业工人约三万人从昨天深夜起组织起来前往各个主要车站，布置纠察线，两万名学生通宵守备在各个主要车站，他们阻止了警察当局的破坏和镇压。
    东京中央邮局所属四十九个分局的一万二千名职工，今天清早用举行工作场所大会的方式参加了总罢工。

    今天，东京街头一片宏伟壮观的斗争景象。在东京中央邮局大厦上面，悬挂着醒目的巨型横幅标语。上面写道：“为阻止修改安全条约的工人总罢工万岁！”在空中飘动着的大气球上写着：“阻止批准新安全条约、打倒岸信介内阁！”
    清晨四时起，所有的火车、电车和公共汽车都从第一班车开始停驶。在学生、妇女和各阶层人民的支持下，铁路工人完全控制了东京铁路枢纽品川车站，被称为“日本大门”的东京车站在今天早上七点以前完全被封闭，打倒岸信介内阁和废除日美军事同盟条约的口号震动着大地。“共同社”说，“东京的主要车站都被红旗淹没了”。

    与此同时，全国电气通信工会工人在一千五百个局里进行了一小时实力的斗争。教职员工会会员今天从上班时间起举行了一小时工作场所大会，在这以后，中央和地方政府职员纷纷离开工作场所和举行集会，并且通过“打倒岸信介内阁，解散国会”的决议。

    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治今天早晨在东京对参加总罢工的铁路工人讲话时，号召工人、学生和市民加强团结，斗争到底。
