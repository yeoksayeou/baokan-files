Today's Old City God Temple

The famous small commodity market—Shanghai's Old City God Temple, since the neighborhood residents nearby organized to vigorously develop small commodity production, the small commodities here have become more abundant and the market is becoming more prosperous.

In the first five months of this year, the turnover of the Old City God Temple market was three times that of the same period last year; the total value of self-produced and self-sold small commodities increased by one and a half times compared with the same period last year, and the variety of small commodities reached more than 14,000, exceeding the highest level in history. A large part of these are processed by neighborhood production groups. The market now sells more than 200,000 theatrical and scenic photos every month, all of which are colored by neighborhood women. Among the fashionable hair clips in Sai Zhen Ornaments, the number processed by neighborhood residents accounts for 60% of the output. Hair clips with novel and diverse patterns have always been a prominent feature of the Old City God Temple market. New styles of plastic hair clips shaped like lutes, orchids, Mickey Mouse, pulling radishes, corn, etc., are more colorful and popular with girls after being colored and processed by neighborhood women. The little trinket "Sea Baby" (a kind of seashell) worn by children originally only had patterns of twelve kinds of creatures, and the style was relatively simple; now neighborhood women have added various scenery paintings, making the Sea Baby more endearing and selling faster.

Shanghai's Old City God Temple small commodity market has always been famous throughout the country for its wide variety of goods, affordable prices, and good quality. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people, the supply of small commodities has increased rapidly. On the other hand, after a series of socialist and communist ideological education, the consciousness of the surrounding neighborhood residents has been continuously improved, and their desire to participate in social production has become stronger and stronger. Faced with this situation, the Old City God Temple district Party organization, in the movement of organizing collective production and collective life among neighborhood residents this year, determined to focus on small commodity production, vigorously develop neighborhood and street industries, and at the same time widely link up with relevant factories and commercial departments to obtain assistance in technology, equipment, etc. Up to now, more than 880 residents in this area have established 48 production groups, manufacturing nearly 100 kinds of small commodities such as hair clips, brooches, toys, buttons, and fans.

The main form of neighborhood residents producing small commodities is to accept materials for processing. At present, more than half of the small commodity production groups have established cooperative relationships with the Old City God Temple Daily Necessities Wholesale Department, which provides raw materials or semi-finished products for processing into finished products. The advantage of this processing production is that it is closely linked to market needs and can change patterns and varieties in a timely manner according to seasonal changes and customer preferences. Another form is self-production and self-sales. Residents piece together colorful children's shirts and pants from scraps of undershirt fabric cut from large factories, and use waste velvet left over from clothing factories to make various beautiful velvet buttons. A group of neighborhood women also go directly to the Old City God Temple Daily Necessities Wholesale Department's affiliated factories to undertake assembly, sorting and other auxiliary labor to support their expansion of production.

Now, 80% of the residents in the nine neighborhood committees in the Old City God Temple area have participated in production or service work. The Old City God Temple area presents a thriving scene everywhere. (Attached picture)

    今日老城隍庙

    著名的小商品市场——上海老城隍庙，自从附近的里弄居民组织起来大搞小商品生产以后，这里的小商品更加丰富多彩，市场越来越繁荣了。
    今年头五个月，老城隍庙市场的营业额为去年同期的三倍；自产自销的小商品总值比去年同期增加一倍半，小商品的品种达到一万四千多种，超过历史上的最高水平。其中有很大一部分是里弄生产组加工出来的。市场现在每月销售的二十多万张戏剧、风景照片，全部是由里弄妇女加工着色的。赛珍饰品中风行的琵琶发夹，由里弄居民加工的数量占产量的60％。发夹花样新颖繁多，历来是老城隍庙市场的一个显著特色。形状像琵琶、兰花、米老鼠、拔萝卜、玉米等新式塑料发夹，经过里弄妇女着色加工，显得更加绚丽多彩，更受姑娘们欢迎。孩子戴在手上的小玩意海宝贝（一种贝壳），原来只画有十二种生物的图案，式样比较单调；现在里弄妇女们配画了各种风景，使海宝贝更加逗人喜爱，销售得更快了。
    上海老城隍庙小商品市场，一向以商品花色繁多、价廉物美闻名全国。从大跃进以来，随着城乡人民购买力的迅速提高，小商品的供应量增加得很快。另一方面，周围里弄居民在经过一系列的社会主义、共产主义思想教育后，觉悟不断提高，参加社会生产的愿望越来越强烈。面对这一情况，老城隍庙地区党组织在今年里弄居民组织集体生产和集体生活的运动中，确定以小商品生产为中心，大办里弄和街道工业，同时广泛和有关工场、商业部门挂钩，取得技术、设备等方面的援助。到目前为止，这一带已有八百八十多个居民建立起四十八个生产小组，制造发夹、别针、玩具、钮扣、扇子等近百种小商品。
    里弄居民生产小商品的主要形式是接受来料，进行加工。目前，已有一半以上的小商品生产组和老城隍庙日用品批发部建立了协作关系，由批发部发给原料材料或半成品，加工为成品。这种加工生产的好处是密切结合市场的需要，可以按照时令变化和顾客的爱好及时变换花色品种。还有一种形式是自产自销。居民们把一块块大工厂裁剪下来的零碎汗衫布，拼制成彩色的童衫童裤，利用服装工场剩下的废丝绒制成各种美观的丝绒钮扣。还有一批里弄妇女直接到老城隍庙日用品批发部所属工场，担任装配、整理等辅助劳动，支援它们扩大生产。
    现在，老城隍庙地区的九个里弄委员会，已有80％的居民，参加了生产或服务工作，老城隍庙地区到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。（附图片）
