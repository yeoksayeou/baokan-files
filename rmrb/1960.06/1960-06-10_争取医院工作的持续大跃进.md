Strive for a Continued Great Leap Forward in Hospital Work
Representative of Jiaxing First Hospital, Zhejiang Province, Yin Changxiao

A Better and More Comprehensive Great Leap Forward

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our Jiaxing First Hospital in Zhejiang Province achieved a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959, building upon the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Over the past year, we have adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously launched mass movements, and vigorously carried out technical revolution, overcoming the contradiction of having few personnel and many tasks (the ratio of beds to staff is 1 to 0.318). More than 10,000 technical innovations (an average of 58 per person) were made, an eighty-fold increase compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with more than 100 of them having significant scientific value. Combined with clinical research, 135 papers were written, with 64 published in various domestic magazines. We actively expanded prevention efforts, with an average of 34 people regularly conducting pest elimination and disease prevention work in rural areas, factories, and residential areas, accounting for 19.8% of the total hospital staff, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.

Our entire hospital staff further improved their service attitude, universally launched the "Patient's Home" good service campaign, adhered to the three-shift outpatient system, and vigorously beautified, greenified, and perfumed the wards and environment, ensuring that there were paintings on the walls, flowers along the corridors, and trees in the courtyard. Medical staff treated patients as if they were their own relatives, providing attentive care in every way. Patients reflected:

	Since the launch of "Red, Diligent, and Clever,"
	The hospital has taken on a new look;
	The beautiful environment is refreshing,
	The attitude is warm, and the care is good.
	Countless innovations abound,
	Advanced deeds are too numerous to mention;
	Everything is done for the patients,
	It feels better than home here.

Over the past few years, our hospital has earnestly implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, organized Western doctors to learn from Chinese medicine, and popularized acupuncture techniques among all hospital medical staff. Most Western doctors have initially mastered the theory and diagnostic and treatment techniques of traditional Chinese medicine. Based on learning and improving, it has been applied to clinical practice, with about 80% of hospitalized patients receiving simultaneous treatment with Chinese medicine. Due to the cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine, significant results have been achieved in the research of late-stage schistosomiasis, diphtheria, tetanus, epidemic meningitis, infectious hepatitis, and other diseases. For example, the efficacy of treating late-stage schistosomiasis patients has reached over 90%, and the cure rate of epidemic meningitis has been increased to 97.5%. Most small and medium-sized surgeries use acupuncture anesthesia. Over the past few years, more than 200 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine therapies have been mastered by Western doctors in clinical practice, treating many patients and achieving satisfactory results.

Following the principle of running the hospital diligently and frugally, and based on the vigorous technical revolution, we have reduced patient expenses by nearly 20,000 yuan over the past year. For example, spleen removal surgery used to cost 200 to 300 yuan per case. Now, by using the method of returning the blood accumulated in the patient's spleen back to the patient, medical costs have been greatly reduced, costing only 60 yuan per case. In terms of technical innovation, we also use locally sourced materials, utilizing waste and substitutes. Take the "universal physiotherapy machine" as an example: one set of electronic tubes can replace nine kinds of electrotherapy machines. If we were to buy these nine kinds of electrotherapy machines on the market, they would be worth more than 3,100 yuan, while we only spent 310 yuan on material costs. In addition, we established two central blood banks from scratch, supplying a total of more than 660,000 milliliters of whole blood and plasma to the urban area and the four neighboring counties over the past year.

In order to improve the quality of medical care, we established an intermediate nurse training class in 1958. After training, they are all able to independently handle ward work. In 1960, we established a new elementary nursing class, and also organized regular professional learning for on-the-job personnel. The hospital's Chinese and Western doctors also undertake the teaching tasks and internship guidance work for medical schools and intermediate health schools. And helped brother counties and commune hospitals train cadres.

Due to the greatly improved quality of medical care, compared with 1958, the bed turnover rate increased by 9.95%, the cure rate increased by 8%, and medical accidents were basically eliminated in 1959.

Following the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, we achieved a "good start" and a "complete success" in 1960. In the first quarter, more than 3,000 technical innovations were made, equivalent to 31.57 times the total of the first three quarters of 1959, of which more than 100 had significant scientific value. Thirty scientific papers were written, and sixteen were published in various domestic magazines. In addition, we implemented the "one-stop" ward round method (checking, diagnosing, testing, and nursing at the same time). Technical innovations in testing and schistosomiasis treatment have been coordinated into complete sets. Under the call to advance towards mechanization, electrification, and automation, all hospital staff worked hard for three months and manufactured semiconductor thermometers, heart sound amplifiers, electronic blood pressure monitors, and lesion detectors. They also created a three-purpose physiotherapy machine (drug iontophoresis, electro-sleep, ultra-shortwave physiotherapy) using the principle of shortwave, taking a step towards the mechanization, automation, and electrification of hospital work. The quality of medical care has also been significantly improved. Compared with the same period in 1959, the cure rate increased by 3% in the first quarter of 1960. The mortality rate decreased by 1.31%. In March of this year, through the study of the "Pinglu Incident," the communist spirit of all hospital staff greatly increased, further establishing the idea of "everything for the patient," and the service attitude was further improved. A good situation of high-speed, continuous Great Leap Forward in hospital work has been formed.

The Victory of the Struggle Between Two Roads

Over the past year, we have deeply realized in our work that the process of achieving a continuous Great Leap Forward in hospital work is a process of struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and it is a process of continuous revolution.

After achieving a decisive victory on the political front through the anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement in the spring of 1957, with the high-speed development of socialist construction, we achieved the Great Leap Forward in hospital work in 1958. In the spring of 1959, industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings showed a new situation of continuous leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Encouraged by this excellent situation, the vast majority of people were high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, and determined to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward in hospital work. However, some people believed that "the leap forward has reached its peak, and it is impossible to continue the Great Leap Forward," saying that "the staff has been reduced by one-third, there are few people and many tasks, and continuing the Great Leap Forward cannot guarantee quality and will lead to accidents," etc. Some people also had relatively serious complacency. The Party branch analyzed and studied these ideological situations in a timely manner, took rectification as the key, and carried out meticulous and in-depth political and ideological work. First, it organized the entire hospital staff to study the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the resolution on several issues concerning people's communes, unifying thinking layer by layer from within the Party to outside the Party, from leaders to the masses. Second, it used facts and reasoning to carry out special-topic airing of views and debates. The topics of the debate were: Can hospital work continue to make a Great Leap Forward? Should we continue to make a Great Leap Forward? How to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward? And these topics were used as regular political study content. Third, it systematically organized medical staff to go to the countryside and factories to participate in labor and pest elimination and disease prevention movements, so that they could be transformed and improved in labor and movements. Through a series of political and ideological work, the vast majority of people initially established the idea of continuous revolution, and realized that hospital work must continue to make a Great Leap Forward, and that it is completely possible to continue the Great Leap Forward.

How to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward? The experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 proved that the revolutionary mass movement is the fundamental key to ensuring the high-speed development of socialist construction. Therefore, we implemented the working method of the mass line in everything and everywhere, and vigorously launched mass movements. There were also many ideological struggles in this process. The vast majority of people believed that only under the leadership of the Party, breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and vigorously launching mass movements centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, can we guarantee the high-speed Great Leap Forward in hospital work. However, some people did not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, blindly believed in experts, and emphasized the particularity of hospital work, believing that "vigorously launching mass movements in hospitals will reduce quality and cause chaos," etc. Based on these situations, the Party branch led all personnel to study documents related to mass movements, and carried out debates on issues such as whether or not it is necessary and possible to vigorously launch mass movements in hospitals (especially in situations where there are few people and many tasks). Through debates and the education of many facts, the vast majority of people clarified that the mass line is the fundamental line of the Party, and that nothing can be accomplished without the masses.

After affirming that hospital work can and must make a Great Leap Forward, and that it can and must vigorously launch mass movements, the Party branch launched one movement after another based on the development of the movement in various periods and the tasks of the entire hospital, promptly pointing out clear directions and constantly proposing new combat goals. In the spring, in the struggle to prevent and control infectious diseases, the Party branch put forward the combat slogan of "everything for the patient," leading all hospital staff to fully rescue patients. The quality of medical care was greatly improved, and the cure rate was one of the highest units in the province. On this basis, the "over-planning" movement centered on technical innovation was launched in the second quarter, putting forward the slogan of "breaking superstitions, establishing great ambitions, exceeding plans, and creating miracles," striving to increase technical innovation by 103.7% by the end of June compared with the same period in 1958. Compared with the same period in 1958, the cure rate increased by 8.41%, the rate of errors and accidents decreased by 44%, and the service attitude was further improved.

In July of last year, the county committee decided to treat 130,000 schistosomiasis patients in the county. In order to ensure the completion of this political task as scheduled, our hospital also transferred more than 20 people to the disease elimination movement. In this situation of few people and many tasks, most people were even more energetic, full of confidence, and determined to achieve a greater leap forward in hospital work. However, many people believed that there were "four impossibilities" with few people and many tasks: first, it is impossible to guarantee quality; second, it is impossible to improve professional level; third, it is impossible to engage in technical innovation; fourth, it is impossible to engage in prevention. In response to the above ideological situation, the entire hospital once again launched an airing of views and debate, using facts to educate everyone: in 1956, due to the merger of institutions, the entire hospital had more than 700 staff, with only about 200 hospitalized patients, but they still shouted that there were not enough people and the equipment was incomplete. Now the staff has been reduced to 169, and the number of hospitalized patients has increased to about 400. Not only has the work within the hospital been done well, but prevention has also been expanded, with more than 30 people regularly transferred to rural areas and factories to participate in pest elimination and disease prevention work. Through debate, everyone realized that the main key to whether the work of the entire hospital can be done well lies in whether or not politics is put in command and whether or not subjective initiative is fully utilized. On the basis of initially clarifying ideas, the masses were mobilized to make rationalization proposals, and the advanced experience of achieving a greater leap forward in situations with few people and many tasks was summarized and promoted in a timely manner. Through debate and the introduction of advanced experience, it was realized that "there is no limit to the leap forward, and there is no end to the upstream," establishing the idea of continuous leap forward.

In order to further solve the contradiction of few people and many tasks, in September, under the leadership of the prefecture and county committees, the masses were widely and deeply mobilized to carry out the "Red, Diligent, and Clever" competition movement centered on "six comparisons" (comparing putting politics in command, comparing prevention first, comparing service attitude, comparing medical quality, comparing technical innovation, comparing diligence and frugality in running the business). Under the battle cry of "opposing rightism, boosting morale, vigorously carrying out scientific research and technical innovation, improving the quality of medical care, and presenting gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country," the entire hospital staff extensively and deeply carried out the "Patient's Home" movement, vigorously carried out the technical revolution, worked hard for twenty days, made 107 technical innovations, and completed the 22 scientific research projects designated by the central government and the province three months ahead of schedule. Medical quality and work efficiency were greatly improved.

With the in-depth implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the comprehensive development of the "Red, Diligent, and Clever" competition movement, we further opposed rightism, boosted morale, and set off an over-planning movement. In the movement, we constantly grasped advanced individuals, established pace-setters, and vigorously commended good people and good deeds (including patients), and held on-site meetings. The hospital's doctors, nurses, administrative staff, workers, and patients all joined the torrent of the mass movement, full of spirit, high morale, learning from advanced individuals, catching up with advanced individuals, and surpassing advanced individuals, a scene of prosperity. From cadres to workers, everyone engaged in innovation and creation; from doctors to nurses, everyone engaged in research and writing papers. In the two months from the start of the competition in mid-October to mid-December, the entire hospital made a total of 7,836 technical innovations, and medical quality and work efficiency were significantly improved. The self-made "universal physiotherapy machine" can be used for electrophoresis, electro-sleep, permeation, drug iontophoresis, and other therapies, and can treat liver cirrhosis, spleen pain, and other diseases of late-stage schistosomiasis that were previously considered untreatable; it can also be used for respiratory first aid. This physiotherapy machine can treat seven patients at the same time (remote control operation), and can also broadcast lyrical and beautiful music to the patients, making them feel comfortable. The laboratory created an ultra-micro rapid testing method. In the past, general routine testing required drawing six to seven milliliters of blood and the test time was two hours. Now, only a few drops of blood are needed, and the working efficiency is increased by 40 times in three minutes, and the accuracy is greatly improved than before. After the automatic saline device was installed in the operating room, one nurse can take care of two operating rooms at the same time, achieving one person replacing two, fundamentally solving the contradiction of few people and many tasks. The movement has thus developed in depth, one link after another, one step deeper than the previous, and one wave higher than the previous.

Maintain the Glorious Title of Advanced Pace-Setter

The comprehensive Great Leap Forward that our hospital has achieved since 1959 is, in the final analysis, the result of the wise leadership of the Party, and is the great victory of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the revolutionary mass movement under the leadership of the Party in the field of hospital work. Although the on-site meeting of Jiaxing hospital work in the province last year gave us the title of provincial hospital pace-setter, our work is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. We are determined to continue to hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune under the correct leadership of the Party at the higher level, and advance victoriously. We will fight a big battle in 1960, transferring 30% of the staff to the countryside, factories, and residential areas to carry out the movement of pest elimination and disease prevention; continue to vigorously carry out technical revolution, and gradually realize the mechanization, automation, and electrification of hospital work; vigorously carry out medical scientific research, and improve the quality of medical care; and further establish the communist service attitude of serving patients wholeheartedly. Our slogan is "Adhere to continuous revolution, always maintain the title of advanced pace-setter in the province, and guarantee leap forward again and again."

    争取医院工作的持续大跃进
    浙江省嘉兴第一医院代表　尹长孝
    更好更全面的大跃进
    在党的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们浙江省嘉兴第一医院在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年实现了更好更全面的大跃进。一年来，我们坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，克服了人少事多（病床与工作人员比例为一比零点三一八）的矛盾。技术革新一万多件（平均每人五十八件）比大跃进的1958年激增八十倍，其中一百多项具有重大的科学价值。结合临床研究，写出论文一百三十五篇，发表在国内各种杂志上的有六十四篇。积极扩大预防，平均经常有三十四人在农村、工厂、居民区开展除害灭病工作，占全院工作人员总数的19．8％，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    我们全院工作人员进一步改进了服务态度，普遍开展“病员之家”良好服务运动，坚持三班门诊制，大搞病房和环境美化、绿化、香化，做到壁上有画，廊沿有花，庭院有树。医务人员待病人胜如自己的亲人，百般殷勤照料，病人反映：
    自从开展红勤巧，　医院出现新面貌；
    环境美化人舒畅，　态度热情照顾好。
    革新项目无计数，　先进事迹说不了；
    处处事事为病人，　在此感到比家好。
    几年来，我院认真的贯彻了党的中医政策，组织了西医学习中医，全院医护人员普及了针灸技术，大部分西医已初步掌握了中医理论及诊疗技术。在边学边提高的基础上，已运用到临床，约80％的住院病人同时使用中医治疗。由于中西医的合作，大搞科学研究工作，对晚期血吸虫病、白喉、破伤风、流行性脑膜炎、传染性肝炎等病的研究，已取得了显著的效果。如：治疗晚期血吸虫病人，其疗效达90％以上，流行性脑膜炎的治愈率已提高到97．5％，大部分中小手术都使用针灸麻醉。几年来在临床上已有二百多种中医疗法被西医所掌握，治疗了很多病人，都取得了满意的效果。
    本着勤俭办院的原则，在大闹技术革命的基础上，一年来，减低病人费用近二万元。如外科脾脏切除手术，过去每例要二三百元，现在采用把病人积存在脾脏里的血，回输给病人的办法以后，医药费用大大降低，每例只要六十元。在技术革新方面，我们也都是就地取材，利用废料和代用品。就拿“万能理疗机”一项来说，用一套电子管可代替九种电疗机，如果要在市场上买齐这九种电疗机，价值三千一百余元，而我们只花了三百一十元成本费。此外，白手办起中心血库两个，一年来供应市区和邻近四个县的全血和血浆共六十六万多毫升。
    为了提高医疗质量，我们于1958年就举办一个中级护士班，经过学习，都能够独立担当病房工作；1960年又新办一个初级护理班，同时组织在职人员的定期业务学习，医院的中西医，还担任医专和中级卫校的教学任务及实习辅导工作。并帮助兄弟县和公社医院培养了干部。
    由于医疗质量大大提高，1959年与1958年相比，病床周转率提高9．95％，治愈率提高8％，医疗事故基本消灭。
    继1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，1960年又实现了开门红和满堂红。第一季度技术革新达三千多件，相当于1959年前三个季度总和的三十一点五七倍，其中，一百多项具有重大的科学价值。写出科学论文三十篇，发表在国内各种杂志上的有十六篇。此外，实行了“一条龙”查病房法（边查、边诊、边检、边护）。在检验和血吸虫病治疗等方面的技术革新已经配合成套。全院人员在向机械化、电气化、自动化进军的号召下，奋战三个月，制成了半导体体温计、心音放大机、电子血压计、病变探测仪，并利用短波原理创制成三用理疗机（药游子透入，电睡眠、超短波理疗）向医院工作机械化、自动化、电气化迈进一步。医疗质量又有显著提高。1960年第一季度与1959年同期相比，治愈率提高3％。病死率下降1．31％。今年3月，通过“平陆事件”的学习，全院人员的共产主义风格大高涨，进一步树立了一切为病人的思想，服务态度进一步改善，医院工作高速度持续大跃进的大好局面已经形成。
    两条道路斗争的胜利
    一年来，我们在工作中深深体会到，实现医院工作持续大跃进的过程，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争过程，是不断革命的过程。
    通过1957年春天的反右派斗争和整风运动，在政治战线上取得决定性胜利以后，随着社会主义建设事业高速度发展，实现了1958年医院工作的大跃进。1959年春天，工农业生产和其他各项建设事业在1958年大跃进的基础上出现了持续跃进的新局面，在这大好形势的鼓舞下，绝大部分人员意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心实现医院工作的继续大跃进，但是也有人认为“跃进已经到顶，要继续大跃进不可能”，说什么“人员减少了三分之一，人少事多，继续大跃进就不能保证质量，要出事故”等等；也有的人存在着比较严重的自满情绪。党支部及时分析研究了这些思想情况，以整风为纲，开展细致、深入的政治思想工作。首先，组织全院人员学习八届六中全会决议和人民公社若干问题决议中有关不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的理论，从党内到党外，从领导到群众，层层统一思想。其次，用摆事实，讲道理，开展专题鸣放辩论。辩论的题目是：医院工作能不能继续大跃进？要不要继续大跃进？如何实现继续大跃进？并把这些题目作为经常性的政治学习内容。再次，有计划的组织医务人员下乡下厂参加劳动和除害灭病运动，使他们在劳动和运动中得到改造提高。通过一系列的政治思想工作，绝大多数人员初步树立了不断革命思想，认识到医院工作必须继续大跃进，而且完全能够继续大跃进。
    怎样实现继续大跃进呢？1958年大跃进的经验证明，革命的群众运动是保证社会主义建设事业高速度发展的根本关键，因此，我们事事、处处贯彻群众路线的工作方法，大搞群众运动。这当中也有不少的思想斗争，绝大多数人认为，只有在党的领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，才能保证医院工作高速度的大跃进。但是也有部分人不相信群众的智慧和力量，迷信专家，强调医院工作的特殊性，认为“医院里大搞群众运动会降低质量，会出乱子”等等。支部根据这些情况，领导全体人员学习有关群众运动的文件，开展了医院里（特别是在人少事多的情况下）要不要、能不能大搞群众运动等问题的辩论。通过辩论和许多事实的教育，绝大多数人明确了群众路线是党的根本路线，离开了群众就会一事无成。
    在肯定了医院工作能够和必须大跃进、能够和必须大搞群众运动以后，支部就根据各个时期运动发展的情况和整个医院的任务，开展了一个接一个的运动，及时指出明确的方向和不断提出新的战斗目标。春季，在防治传染病的斗争中，支部提出“一切为病人”的战斗号召，领导全院人员，全力抢救病人，医疗质量大大提高，治愈率为全省最高单位之一。在这一基础上，第二季度又开展以技术革新为中心的“超规划”运动，提出了“破除迷信，立大志，超规划，创奇迹”的口号，争取到6月底技术革新比1958年同时期增长103．7％；医疗质量与1958年同期相比，治愈率提高8．41％，差错事故降低44％，服务态度进一步改善。
    去年7月，县委决定全县治疗血吸虫病人十三万，为了保证这一政治任务的如期完成，我院又抽调了二十多人投入灭病运动，在这种人少事多的情况下，大部分人员更是干劲十足，信心百倍，决心实现医院工作的更大跃进。但是也有不少人认为人少事多“四不能”：一不能保证质量；二不能提高业务水平；三不能搞技术革新；四不能搞预防。针对上述思想情况，全院又一次开展鸣放辩论，以事实对大家进行教育：1956年由于机构合并，全院七百多工作人员，住院病人仅二百人左右，但还叫喊人员不够，设备不全，现在工作人员减少到一百六十九人，住院病人增加到四百人左右，不但搞好了院内工作，还扩大了预防，经常抽调三十多人到农村、工厂参加除害灭病工作。通过辩论，使大家认识到：全院工作能不能搞好的主要关键，是在于有没有政治挂帅，有没有充分发挥主观能动作用。在思想初步明确的基础上，发动群众提合理化建议，并及时总结和推广在人少事多的情况下实现更大跃进的先进经验。通过辩论和先进经验的介绍，认识到“跃进无限制，上游无止境”，树立了不断跃进的思想。
    为了进一步解决人少事多的矛盾，9月份在地、县委的领导下，广泛深入地发动群众，开展以“六比”（比政治挂帅、比预防为主、比服务态度、比医疗质量、比技术革新、比勤俭办事业）为中心的“红勤巧”竞赛运动，全院人员在“反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞科学研究和技术革新，提高医疗质量，向建国十周年献礼”的战斗口号下，广泛深入地开展“病员之家”运动，大闹技术革命，奋战二十天，技术革新一百零七件，提前三个月完成了中央和省所指定的二十二项科研项目，医疗质量和工作效率都大大提高。
    随着党的八届八中全会决议的深入贯彻和“红勤巧”竞赛运动的全面开展，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起超规划运动。在运动中我们不断抓先进，立标兵，大力表扬好人好事（包括病人），召开现场会议。全院的医生、护士、行政人员、工友、病人都投入到群众运动的洪流中去，意气风发，斗志昂扬，互相学先进，赶先进，超先进，一片欣欣向荣气象。从干部到工人，人人闹革新，个个搞创造；从医师至护士，人人搞研究，个个写论文。从10月中旬开展竞赛到12月中旬止的两个月中，全院技术革新共达七千八百三十六件，医疗质量和工作效率显著提高。自制的“万能理疗机”能用作电泳、电睡眠、透入、药游子透入等等疗法，能治疗晚期血吸虫病肝硬化、脾区痛等等过去认为无法治疗的病症；还能用来进行呼吸急救。这架理疗机能够同时治疗（隔室操纵）七个病人，并且还能为病人播送抒情优美的音乐，使病人感到舒适，检验室创造了超微量快速检验法，过去一般常规检验要抽血六至七毫升，化验时间两小时，现在只须几滴血，三分钟，工作效率提高四十倍，准确性比过去大大提高。手术室里安装了盐水自动装置以后，一个护士可以同时照管两个手术室，做到一人抵两人，从根本上解决了人少事多的矛盾。运动就这样一环扣一环，一步深一步，一浪高一浪地深入发展。
    保持先进标兵的光荣称号
    我们医院在1959年以来所获得的全面大跃进，归根结底，是党的英明领导的结果，是党的社会主义建设总路线和党领导下的革命群众运动在医院工作方面的伟大胜利。去年全省的嘉兴医院工作现场会议虽给了我们以省的医院标兵称号，但是我们的工作距离党和人民的要求还很远，我们决心在上级党的正确领导下，继续高举总路线，大跃进，人民公社三面红旗，乘胜前进。我们要大战1960年，抽调30％的人员下乡、下厂、下居民区，开展除害灭病运动；继续大闹技术革命，逐步实现医院工作机械化、自动化和电气化；大搞医学科学研究，提高医疗质量；进一步树立全心全意为病人的共产主义服务态度。我们的口号是“坚持不断革命，永远保持全省先进标兵称号，保证跃进再跃进。”
