    Vigorously Grasp Quality
    Kong Sang
    The steelmaking front in Yunnan is launching a "100 Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" campaign, mobilizing all employees to vigorously grasp quality. This move is well-targeted and timely.
    The battle for a substantial increase in production over the past two months has brought a scene of abundant harvests to the industrial front. Hundreds and thousands of factories and mines have seen significant production increases in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Through meticulous work in consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of technological innovation, all sectors have found their own paths to increased production, and the trend of continuous production increases is in full swing. At this time, emphasizing the importance of grasping quality is very necessary. On the one hand, it reminds people to more comprehensively aim at our advancing goals, preventing complacency with existing achievements and relaxation of fighting spirit. On the other hand, it will promote a better and more comprehensive leap forward in production, establishing the growth of our production level on a more solid foundation.
    It is the Party's consistent requirement to grasp quality while grasping quantity. Quantity and quality are interconnected and mutually influential. The development of quantity is conducive to the improvement of quality; improved quality, in turn, is conducive to the increase in quantity. If quality is unstable, although quantity increases, the actual value of that quantity decreases. By ensuring both quantity and quality, we achieve a comprehensive leap forward that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The Yunnan converter workers' grasping of the crucial link of quality in the continuous leap forward in production has immediately yielded significant results: steel production increased by 20% in five days compared to the previous five days, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by 185 kilograms compared to May. The Yunnan facts are just one example among thousands that prove the Party's correct policies.
    Whether or not we value quality is not just a production issue, but also an issue of ideological style. Seeking only quantity and not asking about quality is a bad style. To grasp quality, we must oppose this bad style remaining in some individuals and advocate the spirit of seeking truth from facts, one step at a time. Doing a good job in this matter will not only yield economic benefits, but will also allow our Party's pragmatic ideological style to take root more widely and deeply on the industrial front.
    As long as we do our work conscientiously and thoroughly, ensuring and improving product quality while ensuring the quantity of products is not a difficult task. Countless past experiences have proven that as long as we value it and grasp it firmly, quality can definitely be improved. If the masses are mobilized, this upward speed is very rapid. The substantial increase that appeared in the Yunnan steelmaking front within five days is the result of leading cadres valuing quality and mobilizing all employees to grasp quality.
    At this moment of celebrating the abundant harvests of the first half of the year, at this moment of vigorously grasping preparatory work and welcoming the continued leap forward in the third quarter, may every enterprise not forget to tightly grasp the important link of quality.

### 狠抓质量

    狠抓质量
    孔桑
    云南炼钢战线开展“百炉无废钢”运动，全体职工动员起来狠抓质量。这一着抓得好，抓得及时。
    两个月来争夺大幅度增产的战斗，给工业战线带来一片丰收景象。成百成千的工厂矿山上半年生产比去年同期有了很大增长。通过细致的对技术革新成果的巩固、推广、提高的工作，各行各业都找到了自己的增产门路，生产不断上升的趋势方兴未艾。在这个时候，强调地提出抓质量，是十分必要的。它一方面提醒人们更加全面地看准我们的前进目标，防止满足于现有的成绩而松懈斗志；另一方面将促进生产更好更全面地跃进，使我们的生产水平的增长建立在更为坚实的基础上。
    在抓数量的同时必须抓质量，这是党的一贯要求。数量和质量是互相联系、互相影响的。数量的发展，有利于质量的提高；质量提高了，也就有利于数量的增加。如果质量不稳定，数量虽然增加了，但这个数量的实际价值却减少了。既保证了数量，又保证了质量，我们也就实现了多快好省的全面跃进。云南的转炉工人在生产不断跃进中抓住质量这个重要环节，就立即得到了显著的成效：五天中使钢产量比前五天增长20％，每吨钢的生铁消耗量比5月份减少了一百八十五公斤。云南的事实，只是证明党的正确方针的千百个例子中的一个例子。
    是不是重视质量，不仅仅是生产问题，也是思想作风问题。只求数量，不问质量，这是一种不好的作风。我们要抓质量，就要反对个别人身上残留着的这种不好的作风，提倡一步一个脚印的求实精神。抓好了这件事，收到的不仅仅是经济效果，而且将使我们党的实事求是的思想作风在工业战线上更加广泛深入地扎下根来。
    只要我们踏踏实实地把工作做到家，在保证产品的数量同时，保证和提高产品质量，并不是一件难事。过去无数的经验证明，只要重视它，抓紧它，质量就一定可以提高。如果把群众发动起来，这种上升的速度是十分迅速的。云南炼钢战线五天之内出现了一个大幅度上升，就是领导干部重视质量，把全体职工发动起来抓质量的结果。
    在这庆祝上半年丰收的时刻，在这大抓准备工作，迎接第三季度持续跃进的时刻，愿每一个企业都不要忘记紧抓质量这个重要环节。
