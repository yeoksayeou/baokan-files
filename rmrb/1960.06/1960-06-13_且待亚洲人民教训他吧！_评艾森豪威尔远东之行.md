Let the Asian People Teach Him a Lesson!
——A Commentary on Eisenhower's Trip to the Far East

After burying the Four-Power Summit in Paris and gathering the lackeys of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in Washington to plot new war schemes in the Far East, U.S. President Eisenhower has now begun his trip to the Far East. Eisenhower departed from Washington on June 12th and will be conducting activities in the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, and other places. Like an owl entering a house, it brings no peace. Eisenhower's trip to the Far East is a major step by the United States to exacerbate tensions in Asia. It will bring new threats to the Asian people.

Currently, the U.S. imperialists' situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable. The sabotage of the Four-Power Summit by the U.S. government has completely exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower himself, which had been temporarily concealed by a smokescreen of false peace, thus placing them in unprecedented isolation in the eyes of peace-loving people around the world. Moreover, the new storm of patriotic and righteous struggles launched by the people of Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Turkey has plunged U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Asia into a state of siege on all sides. Under these circumstances, the U.S. ruling clique is particularly worried that its aggressive "chain" in the Far East will be shattered by the people of various countries. Recently, the U.S. press has been anxiously referring to this situation as the "Far East crisis."

Obviously, the primary task of Eisenhower's trip to the Far East is to brutally interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, suppress the patriotic and righteous struggles of the people of various countries, and protect its running dogs in order to continue using them as tools for the U.S. to enslave the people of various countries and maintain its entire aggressive front in Asia, preventing a complete collapse. The focus of Eisenhower's "visit" is Japan, partly because Japan occupies a particularly important position in the U.S.'s Far East war plans, and partly because the Kishi Nobusuke regime is tottering and on the verge of collapse, with the situation being particularly unfavorable. The U.S. is very afraid that if Kishi Nobusuke falls now, it will be difficult to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, thereby dismantling the entire U.S. aggressive system in the Far East. "New York Times" foreign affairs analyst Sulzberger admitted that if the U.S.'s running dog in Japan collapses, the U.S. "will have to adjust our (U.S.) position in the entire Far East." This is why the White House insisted on Eisenhower's visit to Japan despite the strong opposition of the Japanese people. Before Eisenhower departed, the U.S. Senate hurriedly "deliberated" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and Kishi Nobusuke also announced that the treaty would be "deliberated" in the Japanese Senate. It is very clear that the conspiracy of the U.S. and the Kishi Nobusuke group is to force the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to take effect early, officially binding Japan to the U.S. war chariot. A June 5th dispatch from Japan's Kyodo News Agency said that Eisenhower's insistence on going to Japan was aimed at "establishing the new Security Treaty" and "giving the Kishi cabinet, which is facing a state of death, a final boost." Similarly, Eisenhower's activities in South Korea are also due to the fact that the Heo Jeong cabinet, like the Syngman Rhee cabinet, is opposed by the South Korean people, and the U.S. is worried about the emergence of "new storms" and "new troubles" there. "Business Week" clamored: "If we (the U.S.) lose control of Korea," it will "disrupt our (U.S.) military and political strategy in the Far East." Eisenhower's trip to the Far East once again nakedly exposes that U.S. imperialism is the pillar of the most reactionary and decadent forces in Asian countries and the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asian countries.

Of course, Eisenhower's purpose in this trip is not only to stabilize some of the U.S.'s puppet regimes in the Far East, but also to further deploy war plans with Japan as the backbone. In November last year, U.S. Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt convened a secret meeting in Baguio attended by the military leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, plotting to organize a new military aggressive bloc. At the recently concluded Washington meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the U.S.'s war deployment in the entire Far East, centered on Japanese militarism, was also discussed. And Eisenhower's expansion of his Far East "travel" range this time is certainly not accidental. Japan's Kyodo News Agency described Eisenhower's activities as having a "color of inspecting the Far East front," and revealed that "he (Eisenhower) is visiting the de facto Northeast Asia Treaty Organization after holding the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council," and will conduct "a series of discussions on military issues." Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma also revealed that Eisenhower's purpose in visiting Japan is to "establish a strategic system in the Far East." That is to say, while the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are colluding to impose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on the Japanese people, the U.S. is stepping up its efforts to link Japan with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the ANZUS Treaty Organization, thereby completing its military bloc system in East Asia and the Western Pacific to threaten socialist countries and Southeast Asian countries, and preparing for the U.S. to launch aggressive wars in the Far East. This war conspiracy that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East is to carry out cannot but be a huge threat to Asian peace.

If Eisenhower's eleven-nation trip last year carried a hypocritical "olive branch" to deceive the people of Asia and the world, then this time Eisenhower has almost undisguisedly revealed the bloody fire and sword to the people of Asian countries. The so-called "goodwill and peace visit" rhetoric can no longer fool people. Look, while Eisenhower is "visiting" the Far East, isn't the U.S. stepping up its military deployment and carrying out provocative activities in the Far East? One hundred and twenty supersonic U.S. aircraft are on standby in the Far East for so-called "training exercises"; U.S. naval and air power in the Taiwan Strait is "ready to act when necessary"; U.S. troops invading Korea have also announced the start of a series of provocative "exercises" and are in a "state of alert"; the U.S. Seventh Fleet has entered the port of Kobe, Japan, and will conduct large-scale amphibious "exercises" in South Korea; the U.S. is stepping up the establishment of missile bases in the Philippines and is increasing troops to Okinawa in order to "make a more flexible response in the Western Pacific." And Eisenhower himself is clamoring about "deterrence" and "retaliation." These means of military intimidation by U.S. imperialism are direct provocations against the Japanese people, the South Korean people, the Chinese people, and all Asian people.

U.S. imperialism's aggression and war preparations in Asia have always been carried out under the cover of an anti-China black flag. The U.S. ruling clique, on the occasion of Eisenhower's visit to the Far East, once again issued a series of anti-China clamors. Eisenhower, Nixon, Herter, and Parsons and their ilk have been wantonly slandering China for "threatening" and "aggressing." U.S. Secretary of State Herter even insisted that the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle was "incited by China." The U.S. propaganda machine also said that the storm of anti-U.S. struggles of the people of various Asian countries was "instigated" by China. You American masters, who have always been arrogant, are a little too "modest" in this regard. It is not others who are instigating and inciting the anti-U.S. storm of the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Asian people, but precisely U.S. imperialism, which has done all kinds of bad things in those countries. U.S. imperialism is an irreplaceable negative teacher for the continuous improvement of the consciousness of the people of Asia and even the world. This time, Eisenhower's personal trip to the Far East to plot new wars, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and carry out sinful activities of hostility towards the people of Asian countries will inevitably further play the role of a negative teacher. Wherever Eisenhower goes, it will arouse greater anger among the people and ignite greater anger against U.S. imperialism. In Tokyo, Eisenhower's "advance man," Hagerty, has already encountered the Japanese people's "disarming welcome." The Japanese people will also "welcome" this U.S. president with the 18th unified action and successive general strikes. Workers and students in the Philippines have decided to hold large-scale demonstrations when Eisenhower arrives in Manila. The people of South Korea are brewing a storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its new puppet Heo Jeong, which has shocked the Heo Jeong group into exclaiming "the situation is serious." The people of Okinawa have also decided to launch a large-scale anti-U.S. demonstration to "welcome" the U.S. president. In the hearts of the people of various countries, Eisenhower, who represents U.S. imperialism, has long become a rat running across the street. Due to Hagerty's experience, it is said that Eisenhower himself is already "uneasy." However, Eisenhower, who is caught in a dilemma, has no choice but to bite the bullet and insist on his trip to the Far East. It can be asserted that Eisenhower's "travel" is not pleasant. The awakened Asian people know how to teach him a lesson!

### 且待亚洲人民教训他吧！——评艾森豪威尔远东之行

    且待亚洲人民教训他吧！
     ——评艾森豪威尔远东之行
    美国总统艾森豪威尔，在巴黎埋葬了四国首脑会议、在华盛顿纠集了东南亚侵略集团的仆从们策划了远东新战争的阴谋以后，现在又开始了他的远东之行。艾森豪威尔已在6月12日启程离开华盛顿，将要到菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜以及冲绳、台湾等地进行活动。夜猫子进宅，家宅不宁。艾森豪威尔远东之行，正是美国加剧亚洲紧张局势的一个重要步骤。它将给亚洲人民带来新的威胁。
    目前，美帝国主义的处境是越来越不妙了。四国首脑会议遭到美国政府的破坏，已使美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔本人一度被假和平的烟幕所笼罩起来的侵略本相毕露无遗，因而在全世界爱好和平的人民面前陷于空前的孤立；而日本、南朝鲜、土耳其等亚洲国家人民掀起的爱国正义斗争的新风暴，又使美帝国主义及其在亚洲的走狗们陷于四面楚歌的困境。在这种形势下，美国统治集团特别担心它在远东的侵略“锁链”会被各国人民所打碎。最近美国报刊惶惶不安地把这种情况称之为“远东危机”。
    显然，艾森豪威尔远东之行的首要任务，就是横蛮干涉各国的内政，压制各国人民的爱国正义斗争，庇护它的走狗，以继续利用它们作为美国奴役各国人民的工具，维护它在亚洲整个的侵略阵线，而不致全线崩溃。艾森豪威尔这次“访问”的重点是在日本，一则是因为日本在美国的远东战争计划中占有特殊重要的地位；再则是因为岸信介政权已摇摇欲坠，危在旦夕，局势特别不妙。美国十分害怕如果岸信介现在倒台，将使日美军事同盟条约难于通过，从而瓦解美国在远东的整个侵略体系。“纽约时报”外交事务分析员苏兹贝格就承认，如果美国在日本的走狗垮台，美国“将不得不对我们（美国）在整个远东的地位加以调整”。这就是为什么不顾日本人民的强烈反对，白宫坚持艾森豪威尔访日的原因。在艾森豪威尔动身之前，美国参议院赶紧“审议”新日美“安全条约”，而岸信介也接着宣布这个条约在日本参议院进行“审议”。可以看得很清楚，美国和岸信介集团的阴谋就是要强使新日美“安全条约”提早生效，把日本正式缚上美国的战车。日本共同社6月5日的电讯就说，艾森豪威尔坚持去日本，其目标在于“使得新安全条约获得成立”，并“给面临死亡状态的岸内阁最后打气”。同样，艾森豪威尔去南朝鲜活动，也是由于许政内阁和李承晚内阁一样，遭到南朝鲜人民的反对，美国担心在那里出现“新的风暴”和“新的麻烦”。美国“商业周刊”叫嚷：“如果失去对朝鲜的控制”，将会“打乱我们（美国）在远东的军事政治战略”。艾森豪威尔这一回远东之行，再一次赤裸裸地暴露美帝国主义是亚洲各国最反动、最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲各国人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    当然，艾森豪威尔此行的目的不仅仅在于稳住美国在远东的一些傀儡政权，而且还在于进一步部署以日本为骨干的战争计划。去年11月间，美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特曾在碧瑶召集有日本、菲律宾和蒋介石集团的军事首脑参加的秘密会议，策划组织一个新的军事侵略集团。在最近才结束的东南亚条约组织的华盛顿会议上，又讨论了以日本军国主义为中心的美国在整个远东的战争部署问题。而艾森豪威尔这次扩大他的远东“旅行”范围，当然不是偶然的。日本共同社把艾森豪威尔的这次活动称为具有“视察远东前线的色彩”，并且透露，“他（艾森豪威尔）是在举行了东南亚条约组织理事会以后接着就遍访实际上的东北亚条约组织”，并要进行“一系列的有关军事问题的商谈。”日本社会党委员长浅沼也揭露，艾森豪威尔访日的目的，在于“建立远东的战略体系。”这就是说，在美日反动派勾结起来把日美军事同盟条约强加于日本人民的同时，美国正在加紧使日本同东南亚条约组织和美澳新条约组织联系起来，从而完成它在亚洲东部和西太平洋威胁社会主义国家和东南亚国家的军事集团体系，为美国在远东发动侵略战争作好准备。艾森豪威尔远东之行所要执行的这个战争阴谋，对于亚洲和平不能不是巨大的威胁。
    如果说去年艾森豪威尔的十一国之行是带着虚伪的“橄榄枝”，以欺骗亚洲和世界各国人民的话，那么这一回艾森豪威尔几乎不加掩饰地向亚洲各国人民亮出了血腥的火和剑。所谓“亲善与和平访问”的鬼话已经不可能再哄人了。请看在艾森豪威尔“访问”远东的同时，美国不是正在远东加紧部署军事力量，进行挑衅活动吗？一百二十架超音速美国飞机已待命在远东进行所谓“训练演习”；台湾海峡的美国海空力量已经“准备必要时行动”；侵朝美军也宣布开始进行一系列挑衅“演习”，并处于“警戒状态”；美国第七舰队开进日本的神户港，并将在南朝鲜进行大规模的两栖“演习”；美国加紧在菲律宾建立导弹基地，并且向冲绳增兵，以便“在西太平洋作出更灵活的回答”。而艾森豪威尔自己也大叫“威慑”和“报复”。美帝国主义的这种武力恫吓手段，都是对日本人民、南朝鲜人民、中国人民和全亚洲人民的直接挑衅。
    美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略和备战活动，从来都是在反华黑旗的掩护之下进行的。美国统治集团在艾森豪威尔出访远东之际，又一次发出了一连串的反华叫嚣，艾森豪威尔、尼克松、赫脱和帕森斯之流，这些天来大肆诬蔑中国“威胁”和“侵略”。美国国务卿赫脱竟把日本人民的反美爱国斗争硬说成是“中国煽起”的。美国宣传机器把亚洲各国人民反美斗争的风暴也都说成是中国“鼓动”的。素来目中无人的美国老爷们，你们在这一点上未免过于“谦虚”了。鼓动和煽起日本人民、南朝鲜人民和亚洲人民的反美风暴的不是别人，恰恰是在那些国家里做尽了坏事的美帝国主义。美帝国主义是亚洲以至全世界人民不断提高觉悟的不可代替的反面教员。这次艾森豪威尔亲自到远东进行策划新战争、干涉亚洲各国内政和敌视亚洲各国人民的罪恶活动，也必将进一步起反面教员的作用。艾森豪威尔所到之处，将会激起人民更大的愤怒，燃起更大的反对美帝国主义的怒火。在东京，艾森豪威尔的“先行官”哈格蒂已经碰到了日本人民的“下马威”。日本人民并将以第十八次统一行动和接二连三的总罢工“迎接”这位美国总统。菲律宾的工人和学生已决定在艾森豪威尔到达马尼拉时举行大规模的示威。南朝鲜人民在酝酿反对美帝国主义及其新傀儡许政的斗争风暴，使得许政集团惊呼“局势严重”。冲绳人民也已决定发动反美大示威来“迎接”美国总统。代表美帝国主义的艾森豪威尔在各国人民的心目中，早已成为过街的老鼠。由于哈格蒂的尝试，据说艾森豪威尔自己也已“感到不安”。但是，陷于进退两难的艾森豪威尔，已经骑虎难下，只能硬着头皮坚持他的远东之行。可以断言，艾森豪威尔这次“旅行”是并不愉快的。觉醒了的亚洲人民，是懂得怎样去教训他的！
