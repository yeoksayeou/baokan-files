Xinhua News Agency, 14th - Nearly 300 women from all walks of life in the capital held a gathering today to welcome Matsuoka Yoko, a member of the Japanese Literary Delegation, Japanese critic, and well-known women's activist.

    Liu Qingyang, Vice-President of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting. She extended a warm welcome to Matsuoka Yoko on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation and the Beijing Women's Federation, and paid high tribute to the indomitable Japanese women in the anti-American patriotic and just struggle. She said that Chinese women are concerned about every action of Japanese women and are heartened and encouraged by every victory won by the Japanese people and Japanese women. The struggle of the Japanese women and the Japanese people is by no means isolated; Chinese women and the 650 million Chinese people firmly support their struggle.

    Matsuoka Yoko then introduced the situation of Japanese women actively participating in the anti-American patriotic struggle. She said that Japanese women have played a significant role in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Through practical struggle, they have gradually realized that the revival of Japanese militarism and the aggression of U.S. imperialism are the root causes of the suffering of the Japanese people. Opposing U.S. imperialism is the primary task of Japanese women and the people, and this struggle will surely achieve final victory. Matsuoka Yoko's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. Finally, the whole audience stood up and shouted: "Resolutely support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle!" "The people and women of China and Japan unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism! Final victory will surely belong to the people!"

    Also participating in today's gathering were Shen Zijiu, member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, and Wang Chunping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, and others.
