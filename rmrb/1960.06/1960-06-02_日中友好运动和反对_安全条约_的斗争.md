Japanese Friends Talk About the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Struggle
    Sino-Japanese Friendship Movement and the Struggle Against the "Security Treaty"
    Tian Zhong Qingyi, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association
    Since the Ninth National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association last August, activists of the Friendship Association have further clarified the interrelationship between the movement to strive for Sino-Japanese friendship and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and have actively launched anti-American patriotic struggles.
    As early as when the struggle against the "Security Treaty" had not yet developed to its current massive scale and the joint struggle conferences in various regions of the country were less than half of what they are today, the Japan-China Friendship Association launched the "Month for Restoring Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations and Celebrating the Chinese National Day" last year. During this month of action, not only was Sino-Japanese friendship propaganda strengthened in various ways, but members also actively participated in preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty." Centered on the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association and Tokyo, activists from friendship associations in various regions distributed leaflets combining the prevention of the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. They also actively conducted extensive propaganda to the masses through street lectures and other methods. On January 15th and 16th of this year, one hundred and fifty representatives of the Japan-China Friendship Association convened a national activists' conference. The conference decided that breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations was inseparable from the struggle against the "Security Treaty"; the Japan-China Friendship Association should carry out independent activities to conduct the struggle against the "Security Treaty."
    Since the Ninth National Congress, we have launched a large-scale national movement. However, we believe this is not enough. We must now focus on the strength of activists, raise political awareness, and strive to strengthen our working ability as a specialized organization. We must vividly publicize to the broad masses China's position, role, policies, and construction achievements in the world, etc., to satisfy the Japanese people's concern and hopes for China. To achieve this task, we are determined to make greater efforts.

    日本友人谈日本人民反美爱国斗争
    日中友好运动和反对“安全条约”的斗争
    日中友好协会总务部长　田中清逸
    在去年8月日中友好协会举行第九次全国大会以后，友协的积极分子进一步明确了争取日中友好和恢复日中邦交运动同反对日美“安全条约”斗争的相互关系，而积极开展反美爱国斗争。
    早在反对“安全条约”斗争还没有发展到今天这样巨大规模、全国地区的共同斗争会议还不到今天的半数的时候，日中友好协会就于去年发起了“恢复日中邦交和庆祝中国国庆月”。在这个行动月里，不仅通过各种方式加强日中友好宣传，而且使会员积极参加阻止修改
  “安全条约”的斗争。以日中友好协会本部和东京都为中心，各地友协积极分子散发了阻止修改“安全条约”和恢复日中邦交运动相结合的传单。他们并且积极以举行街头讲演会等方式向群众进行广泛的宣传。今年1月15、16日两天日中友好协会代表一百五十人召开了全国积极分子会议。这次会议决定：打开日中关系僵局同反对“安全条约”斗争密不可分；日中友好协会要开展独自的活动来进行反对“安全条约”的斗争。
    在第九次全国大会以后，我们开展了规模巨大的国民运动。但是，我们认为这还是不够的。我们现在要以积极分子的力量为中心，提高政治觉悟，极力加强我们作为专门团体的工作能力。我们要生动地向广大群众宣传中国在世界的地位、作用、政策和建设情况等等，以满足日本人民对中国的关心和希望。为了实现这个任务，我们决心要作更大的努力。
