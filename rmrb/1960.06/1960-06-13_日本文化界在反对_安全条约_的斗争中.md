　　Japanese Cultural Circles in the Struggle Against the "Security Treaty"

　　The "People's Daily" reported: On the day of the largest post-war general strike in Japan on June 4th, many scholars and cultural figures stayed overnight at major train stations to support the workers and conduct propaganda among the general public. Ms. Sumako Fukao, the poet who participated in the struggle, must have been wearing her usual thin scarf, and Reverend Keibun Nishikawa, the Buddhist abbot, must have been very persuasive with his serene and firm attitude. In addition, Professor Yoshimi Takeuchi, who resigned from his civil service position due to his serious dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government's forceful "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, must have delivered a moving speech—I seem to see each of them. And if we had been in Tokyo at that time, we would definitely have acted with them.

　　The "Security Treaty Criticism Association" clearly stated in its "Emergency Declaration" issued on May 26th, the sixteenth unified action day: "We affirm that the workers' strike is a suitable means to regain the sovereignty of the people. Let us support them to the end!" Therefore, their participation in the June 4th general strike was a very natural thing. However, mobilizing a broad range of people from all aspects of the Japanese cultural world to actively support a political strike held by workers (an action that is probably unprecedented in Japanese history) was by no means a simple process.

　　Perhaps it can be said that we were late in taking action this time to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" compared to the time when we opposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the Police Duties Execution Law the year before. Some scholars and commentators formed the "Security Treaty Problem Research Association" in the spring of last year. However, as its name suggests, the initial action began with research on the issue. The "Security Treaty Criticism Association" was formed in October of last year. Although it was organized based on the principle of opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," at that time, some people were hesitant about adding the word "opposition" to the association's name; so it was named "Criticism Association." Despite this, it was the first time since the war that so many people, including workers in literature, drama, film, law, architecture, painting, photography, dance, religion, journalism, and science, had united for a political purpose.

　　As the "Criticism Association's" gatherings and activities increased, more and more people participated. Regarding the so-called "Diet Brawl Incident" that occurred on November 27th of last year, almost all newspapers issued attacking arguments. At that time, we tried to correctly evaluate this incident and decided to go to the Diet on December 10th, the unified action day, to petition. Unexpectedly, more than two hundred people participated in this petition. This surprised even ourselves. It was an epoch-making event. Despite this, none of Japan's major bourgeois newspapers reported it. At this time, in order to let more people know about our actions, we decided to start our own newspaper.

　　About a thousand people participated in the "silent" demonstration on January 11th of this year. Many people, including myself, participated in a demonstration for the first time in their lives. On April 4th, after our meeting, we went to the Diet with ordinary citizens to petition. Nearly a thousand people holding petitions gathered around the Diet, an area where demonstrations are prohibited, which was also unprecedented.

　　In order to help those who could not come to central Tokyo understand the dangers of the "Security Treaty" and also to conduct petitions, we also used propaganda vehicles to promote it in the suburbs of Tokyo. There, we encountered many touching experiences. An elderly woman who sold senbei, thanked us repeatedly after listening to our speech and donated three bags of senbei to us. Several elderly day laborers listened to our speech and gathered in circles to discuss the matter. A female shopkeeper wearing an apron ran over to shake our hands. A couple on their way home from the bathhouse signed the petition. There was also a young man who took us to his home and asked his parents and siblings to sign as well. This made us understand how valuable it is to live among the masses and grow with them.

　　Our gatherings have been obstructed and sabotaged by right-wing elements from the beginning. When we held lectures and demonstrations, people from the news, magazine, and other cultural union always served as our guards. At a lecture held last year, a staff member of the news union was injured in the eye by right-wing elements. And during a demonstration in mid-May, a group of right-wing elements wearing helmets and dressed like American soldiers threw stones at us. However, compared to the actions they took against students and the Miike First Union who were fighting against the "Security Treaty," the obstructive actions taken against us were minimal.

　　A noticeable change was that university professors began to take action during the climax of the struggle against the treaty, which was after the Kishi Nobusuke government forcefully "passed" the new "Security Treaty" late on May 19th. Scholars and cultural figures gathered on May 24th and, after holding a demonstration, held a meeting until late at night and established an action committee of scholars and researchers. The movement then developed to the stage where this committee cooperated with the "Security Treaty Problem Research Association" and the "Criticism Association" to promote the movement.

　　The anti-"Security Treaty" movement over the past year has helped me grow. I mainly participated in activities centered on the "Security Treaty Criticism Association." The action plan was generated through earnest discussions among people from all walks of life for a common purpose. Once an action plan was implemented, the next plan became clear. And I knew: the more you put in your own strength, the more you get. In addition, I also realized that when a person is in the torrent of history, standing in the subjective position of creating a new history, he can most objectively understand that torrent of history.

　　We never think this struggle is easy. However, since the Kishi Nobusuke government called right-wing elements, hooligans, and police into the Diet to stage the ugly drama of forced "passage" of the "Security Treaty" in order to "pass" the "Security Treaty" before Eisenhower's visit to Japan late on May 19th, the true face of the "Security Treaty" has been exposed more clearly than ever before. Perhaps it can be said that because of this, the subsequent struggle has become easier to carry out. Moreover, the anti-Eisenhower visit to Japan is also rising. The current situation has developed to the point where it is very difficult for both the U.S. government and the Japanese government if Eisenhower does not visit Japan today or postpones it. If Eisenhower really visits Japan despite the firm opposition of the vast Japanese people, it will become a fuse to further stimulate the anti-American struggle.

　　Our comrades who stayed in the country are currently working hard in accordance with the words in the "Emergency Declaration" of the "Criticism Association": "For us, the most important thing is not to relax the struggle for a moment." Our feelings in Beijing are exactly the same.

### 日本文化界在反对“安全条约”的斗争中

    日本文化界在反对“安全条约”的斗争中
    日本文学家代表团团员　松冈洋子
    “人民日报”报道：在日本举行战后最大规模的六·四总罢工的那天，许多学者和文化界人士都在主要的车站上通宵支援工人，向一般市民进行宣传。参加这次斗争的诗人深尾须磨子女士一定是像平时那样围着薄围巾，佛教的方丈西川景文先生的安祥而坚定的态度一定很有说服力，此外，因为严重不满岸信介政府强使众议院“通过”新“安全条约”而辞去了公务员职务的竹内好教授也一定发表了动人的讲话——我好像看到了他们之中的每一位。而且，我们当时假如在东京的话，也肯定会同他们一起行动。
    “安全条约批判会”在5月26日第十六次统一行动日发表的“非常事态宣言”中曾明确地说：“我们肯定工人的罢工是夺回人民的主权的合适的手段。让我们支持他们到底吧！”因此，他们参加六·四总罢工，是很自然的事情。但是，要把日本文化界各方面广大人士动员起来，积极支援工人举行的政治性罢工（这种行动恐怕是日本有史以来从来没有过的），这样的过程决不是简单的。
    也许可以说，同前年反对岸信介政府阴谋修改警察官职务执行法的时候相比，我们这次起来反对修改“安全条约”，采取行动是迟了。一部分学者和评论家在去年春天组成了“安全条约问题研究会”。但是，就像它的名字所表明的那样，行动初时还是从对这个问题的研究开始的。“安全条约批判会”是在去年10月组成的。尽管它是根据反对批准新“安全条约”的原则组织起来的，可是，当时还有人对于会名加上“反对”这个词儿的做法有所犹疑；于是就取名为“批判会”。尽管情况如此，可是，包括文学、戏剧、电影、法律、建筑、绘画、摄影、舞蹈、宗教、新闻以及科学等各方面的工作者这样众多的人们为了一个政治目的而团结起来，这在战后还是第一次。
    随着“批判会”的集会活动，参加的人越来越多了。对于去年11月27日发生的所谓“国会乱殴事件”，几乎所有的报纸都发出了攻击的论调，在那个时候，我们努力正确地评价这个事件，并且决定在12月10日的统一行动日到国会去请愿。出乎意料之外，参加这次请愿的人达到二百多位。这使我们自己都吃一惊。它是一件具有划时代意义的事情。尽管如此，日本的几家资产阶级大报却没有作一行报道。这时，为了使更多的人知道我们的行动，我们决心开办自己的机关报。
    参加今年1月11日的“沉默的”示威游行的人约有一千名。连我在内，生平第一次参加示威游行的人是不少的。4月4日，我们在开会以后，就同一般市民一道到国会去请愿。近一千人手里拿着请愿书，到禁止举行游行示威的地区——国会周围去集中，这也是前所未有的事情。
    为了帮助那些不能到东京中心地区来的人们认识“安全条约”的危害，并且也进行请愿，我们还曾经乘宣传汽车到东京郊外去宣传。那里，我们遇到了许多动人的经历。一位贫苦的卖薄脆饼的老大娘听了我们的讲话以后连声道谢，并且捐给我们三袋薄脆饼。几位干零工的老大爷听了我们的讲话以后，围成圈圈，议论这件事情。围着围裙的女掌柜跑过来同我们握手。正在从澡堂回家去的夫妇在请愿书上签名。还有这样的青年，他把我们带到他的家里去，要他的双亲和兄弟也签名。这使我们懂得了生活在群众当中、同群众一起成长是一种多么宝贵的体验。
    我们的集会从最初起就遭到了右翼分子的阻挠和破坏。在我们举行演讲会、示威游行的时候，新闻、杂志和其他文化单位工会的人们总是为我们担任戒备工作。在去年举办的一次演讲会上，有一位新闻工会的工作人员就被右翼分子打伤了眼睛。而5月中旬的一次示威游行中，一队头戴钢盔、打扮很像美国兵的右翼分子竟向我们投掷石块。但是，比起他们对付为反对“安全条约”而斗争的学生和三池第一工会所采取的行动来说，对我们采取的妨碍行动还算是极小的。
    在5月19日深夜岸信介强行“通过”新“安全条约”以后展开的反对这个条约的斗争高潮中，大学教授们开始采取了行动，这是一个显著的变化。学者和文化界人士在5月24日集会并且继举行示威游行以后，又开会到深夜，成立了学者、研究工作者的行动委员会。运动于是发展到这样的阶段：这个委员会同“安全条约问题研究会”和“批判会”共同合作，推进运动。
    这一年多的反对“安全条约”运动使我成长起来了。我主要是参加了以“安全条约批判会”为中心的活动。行动的方针是在各方面人士为了共同目的而进行认真讨论的情况下产生的。当一个行动方针付诸实现以后，下一个方针就明确起来了。而且我知道：拿出自己的力量越多，得到的东西就越多。此外，我也了解到：当一个人在历史的潮流中，站在要创造新的历史这个主观的立场上的时候，他就能够最客观地认识那股历史的潮流。
    我们决不认为这场斗争是轻而易举的。可是，自从5月19日深夜，岸信介政府为了赶在艾森豪威尔访日以前“通过”“安全条约”而把右翼分子、流氓和警察叫进国会演出强行“通过”的丑剧以后，就比过去任何时候都更清楚地暴露了“安全条约”的真面目。也许可以说，正因为如此，这以后的斗争就变得容易进行了。而且，反对艾森豪威尔访日的声浪也日益高涨。眼前的情况已经发展成这样：不论对美国政府或日本政府来说，今天艾森豪威尔不访问日本或者延期都是十分为难的。艾森豪威尔如果不顾广大日本人民的坚决反对，真的来访问日本的话，就会成为进一步激发反美斗争的导火线。
    我们留在国内的同志们目前正在按照“批判会”的“非常事态宣言”中的话进行努力：“对于我们，最重要的是一刻也不放松斗争。”在北京的我们的心情也完全是相同的。
