Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Since May, Tianjin's industrial front has widely promoted forty new technologies and techniques, promoting a leap in production.

In the metallurgical industry, the promotion of new technologies in converter steelmaking has shortened smelting time, increased output by 50%, and reduced coke consumption. According to the new technology, workers in the machinery industry have begun to comprehensively reform the designs of 105 standardized products that have been regarded as authoritative for many years. After the reform, many products have been put into mass production. After the design changes of sixteen varieties and more than forty specifications of water pumps, cement mixers, and electric hoists, 2,779 tons of steel can be saved annually. These steel materials can be used to produce more than 3,000 metal cutting machine tools. The chemical industry has adopted new technologies and techniques to carry out comprehensive utilization of raw materials and materials, increasing production and saving a large amount of raw materials. Many small and medium-sized chemical plants have already achieved basic self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in major raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th: The broad masses of workers in Shenyang's factories, enterprises, and basic construction departments are promoting advanced experiences with vigor and speed.

At present, more than forty major advanced experiences have been widely promoted in the city's industrial and transportation sectors. After the city's electromechanical enterprises promoted the experience of nodular cast iron, the casting efficiency generally increased by one to five times. After promoting the experience of reforming product design, 40% of the old products have changed their appearance. The materials originally used to produce one product can now be used to produce two or more products, and the performance of the products has also been improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th: Chongqing has vigorously grasped the promotion of 97 major advanced experiences that emerged in the technical revolution movement, greatly improving the production level of various industries.

In May, Chongqing's steel plants promoted ten major advanced experiences, and the production level rose steadily. In mid-May, the output of steel and steel products increased by 23.26% and 31.8% respectively compared with the first ten days of the month, and increased by more than 8% respectively in the last ten days of the month compared with the middle ten days of the month. In May, Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company universally promoted major advanced experiences such as multi-trailer high-yield and rapid maintenance, and the average monthly output level per vehicle increased by more than 83% compared with the first quarter.

    天津沈阳重庆先进经验花繁果硕
    钢铁企业冶炼技术提高产量质量增长　机械工业革新产品设计节约大批钢材
    化学工业综合利用资源增产大量原料　交通部门实现多拉快跑运输效率提高
    据新华社天津8日电　天津市工业战线5月份以来广泛推广四十项新工艺新技术，促进了生产跃进。
    冶金行业转炉炼钢推广新技术后，使熔炼时间缩短，产量提高50％，降低了焦炭消耗。机械行业职工根据新的技术，开始对多少年来一直被奉为权威的一百零五种定型产品的设计，进行全面改革，已有不少产品经过改革后成批投入生产。水泵、水泥搅拌机、电葫芦等十六个品种四十多个规格的设计改变后，全年可以节约钢材二千七百七十九吨，用这些钢材可以生产金属切削机床三千多台。化工行业采用新工艺新技术大搞原料材料综合利用，增产节约了大量原料材料，许多中小型化工厂已经作到主要原料基本自给或部分自给。
    据新华社沈阳8日电　沈阳市工厂企业和基本建设部门广大职工，雷厉风行地推广先进经验。
    目前全市工业交通部门已普遍推广的重大先进经验共有四十多项。全市机电企业推广球墨铸造经验以后，铸造效率一般都提高了一倍到五倍，推广了改革产品设计经验以后，有40％的老产品改变了面貌，原来生产一台产品的材料，现在可以用来生产两台或更多的产品，并且还提高了产品的性能。
    据新华社重庆8日电　重庆市大抓技术革命运动中出现的九十七项重大先进经验的推广工作，大大提高了各行各业的生产水平。
    重庆各钢铁厂5月份推广了十项重大先进经验，生产水平节节上升。5月中旬钢和钢材的产量分别比上旬提高了23．26％和31．8％，下旬又比中旬分别提高了8％以上。重庆市汽车运输公司5月份内普遍推广多挂高产、快速保修等重大先进经验，平均每辆车的月产水平比一季度提高了83％以上。
