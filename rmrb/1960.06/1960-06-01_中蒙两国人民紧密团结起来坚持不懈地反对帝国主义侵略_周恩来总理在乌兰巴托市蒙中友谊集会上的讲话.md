Comrade Zedenbal, dear Chairman, dear Comrade Bata, Mayor of Ulaanbaatar, dear comrades and friends:

Today, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to hold such a grand gathering with people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar. This is a conference where the Mongolian people express their sincere friendship towards the Chinese people, and a conference that demonstrates the great friendship between the people of China and Mongolia. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to extend my highest respect to the fraternal Mongolian people.

Our two peoples of China and Mongolia have a traditional and profound friendship. In the past revolutionary struggles, we have always sympathized with and supported each other. In 1945, Marshal Choibalsan personally led his army, with the assistance of the heroic Soviet Red Army, to jointly defeat Japanese imperialism with the Chinese People's Army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further developed on a new basis. We are united, closely cooperating, and mutually assisting each other in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, constantly promoting the development of our two countries' socialist causes. In international affairs, we are closely cooperating to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for world peace. Our friendship is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and it is unbreakable. Today, China and Mongolia have signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance, which will further strengthen the brotherly relationship between our two peoples and further promote the development of our two countries' socialist causes. We believe that the signing of this treaty is also of great significance for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

While celebrating the growing friendship between China and Mongolia, we also congratulate the fraternal Mongolian people with the same joy on the great victories they have achieved in the cause of building their motherland. During our visit, we were pleased to see that the hard work of the Mongolian people has yielded fruitful results. On your vast land, new industries and agriculture are constantly growing and expanding, and the scattered individual animal husbandry has rapidly realized cooperation. With the development of socialist construction and the victory of socialist transformation, the face of the Mongolian People's Republic has undergone tremendous changes. You have transformed a single animal husbandry country into a country that emphasizes both agriculture, animal husbandry and industry. Now, inspired by the policy of accelerating socialist construction mainly through self-reliance formulated by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have launched a new wave of construction and are working hard to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule. We believe that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian government, and Comrade Zedenbal, with the support of the great Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and relying on their own hardworking hands, the Mongolian people will surely create new and greater achievements soon.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, have been building their motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm and selfless labor. The main targets of our Second Five-Year Plan have been completed three years ahead of schedule in 1959. We are determined to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years. We are also confident that we will build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at a relatively fast speed.

In the cause of socialist construction, both China and Mongolia have received assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. Our victory is inseparable from the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries. The Chinese people have always believed that the unity and growth of the socialist camp is a reliable guarantee for us to realize the great ideals of socialism and communism, and it is also the main pillar of world lasting peace and human progress. The Chinese people have always regarded the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their sacred internationalist duty. The attempts of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries to sow discord among our fraternal countries will be in vain forever.

Now, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become incomparably strong. The socialist countries' policy of opposing imperialist aggression and war and striving for lasting world peace has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The people of the world have become more and more clearly aware that US imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. Not long ago, the US Eisenhower government still put on a sheep's skin, attempting to paralyze the people of the world with a smoke screen of peace and undermine the will of the people of all countries to fight for peace, independence, and democracy. However, the fox's tail will be exposed sooner or later, and the aggressive nature of US imperialism will not change. Even when US imperialism was feigning peace, it never ceased its frantic arms expansion and war preparations. Recently, after its spy plane that violated the Soviet border was shot down by the Soviet Union, the US government brazenly rejected the Soviet government's protest against this act of aggression and completely reasonable demands, thereby sabotaging the four-nation government summit that attracted worldwide attention. Subsequently, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, under the instruction of US imperialism, forcibly passed the Japan-US military alliance treaty illegally in the Japanese House of Representatives. For more than a year, the US Air Force and Navy have continuously violated China's airspace and territorial waters. Until recently, this kind of infringement has reached as many as one hundred times. This series of aggressive crimes that undermined world peace once again exposed the ugly face of US imperialism's active preparation for aggressive war in front of the people of the world. These facts have made the people of the world more clearly see the essence of US imperialism, and at the same time further see the faces of those imperialist servants who have always pretended to be fair. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the solemn measures taken by the Soviet government recently against the provocative crimes of US imperialism. The Chinese people have always believed that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is an integral whole connected by flesh and blood. The infringement of US imperialism against any socialist country is an infringement against the 650 million Chinese people, and an infringement against the entire socialist camp, and will inevitably be retaliated twice as hard by the iron fist of the powerful socialist camp.

Comrades, friends, we are in a great new era in which imperialism is heading for collapse and the forces of the world's people are constantly developing. The main characteristic of this era is that the socialist forces surpass the imperialist forces, the progressive forces surpass the reactionary forces, and the forces of peace surpass the forces of war. The era in which imperialism ran rampant and did whatever it wanted has become a thing of the past forever. They cannot stop the wheels of history from moving forward, and they cannot stop the people of the world from rising up to take control of their own destiny. The storms of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism are getting fiercer day by day, and the struggle of the people of the world for peace is developing vigorously. The just struggles of the people of South Korea, Turkey, and Japan are in full swing. The struggle of the oppressed people all over the world against US imperialism and its lackeys is booming. The life of imperialism will not be long. As long as the people of all countries further unite, form a united front against imperialism, mainly a united front against US imperialism, and carry out a resolute struggle, they will surely be able to defeat the imperialist policy of aggression and war.

Let the people of our two countries unite closely and make unremitting efforts to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for lasting world peace.

The final victory belongs to the peace-loving people of the whole world!

    中蒙两国人民紧密团结起来坚持不懈地反对帝国主义侵略
    周恩来总理在乌兰巴托市蒙中友谊集会上的讲话亲爱的泽登巴尔主席同志，亲爱的巴塔市长同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天我们能够有机会同乌兰巴托市的各界人民一道举行这样一个盛大的集会，感到十分高兴。这是蒙古人民对于中国人民表示真诚友好的大会，是表现中蒙两国人民伟大友谊的大会。请允许我代表中国人民向兄弟的蒙古人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    我们中蒙两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。我们在过去的革命斗争中一向就是相互同情和相互支持的。1945年乔巴山元帅亲自率领大军，在英勇的苏联红军协助下，同中国人民军队一道共同击败了日本帝国主义。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国的友好关系在新的基础上得到了更大的发展。我们在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里团结一致，亲密合作，相互援助，不断地促进我们两国的社会主义事业的发展。我们在国际事务中，为反对帝国主义侵略和争取世界和平进行密切的配合。我们的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的，是牢不可破的。今天，中蒙两国签订了友好互助条约，这将进一步加强我们两国人民亲如手足的关系，并且将进一步促进我们两国的社会主义事业的发展，我们相信，这个条约的签订对于维护亚洲和世界的和平，也有着重大的意义。
    在庆祝中蒙友谊日益发展的同时，我们以同样喜悦的心情祝贺兄弟的蒙古人民在建设祖国的事业中所取得的巨大胜利。我们在这次访问过程中高兴地看到，蒙古人民的辛勤劳动已经获得了丰硕的果实。在你们辽阔的土地上，新兴的工业和农业不断增长和扩大，分散的个体畜牧业已经迅速地实现了合作化。随着社会主义建设的发展和社会主义改造的胜利，蒙古人民共和国的面貌发生了巨大的变化。你们已经把一个单一的畜牧业国家变成了农牧业和工业并重的国家。现在，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党制定的以自力更生为主加速社会主义建设的方针鼓舞下，已经掀起一个新的建设热潮，为提前完成三年计划进行着辛勤的劳动。我们相信，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党、蒙古政府和泽登巴尔同志的领导下，在伟大的苏联和其他兄弟国家的支援下，依靠自己勤劳的双手一定能够很快地创造出新的更大的成绩。
    近几年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，以无比的热情、忘我的劳动，建设自己的祖国。我们第二个五年计划的主要指标，已经在1959年提前三年完成。我们决心要在不到十年的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。我们也有信心用较快的速度把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
    中蒙两国在建设社会主义的事业中，都得到苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助，我们的胜利是和社会主义各国的兄弟般的互助合作分不开的。中国人民一贯认为，社会主义阵营的团结和壮大是我们实现社会主义和共产主义伟大理想的可靠保证，也是世界持久和平和人类进步事业的主要支柱。中国人民一向把不断地巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结看作是自己国际主义的神圣职责。帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派在我们兄弟国家之间进行挑拨离间，将永远枉费心机。
    现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经无比强大。社会主义各国反对帝国主义侵略和战争、争取世界持久和平的政策更加深入人心。全世界人民都更加清楚地看到，美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人。不久以前，美国艾森豪威尔政府还披上羊皮，企图以和平的烟幕来麻痹世界人民，瓦解各国人民争取和平、独立、民主的斗争意志。但是，狐狸尾巴迟早是要露出来的，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。即使在美帝国主义伪装和平的时候，它也从来没有停止过疯狂的扩军备战活动。最近，美国政府在它的侵犯苏联国境的间谍飞机被苏联击落之后，竟悍然拒绝苏联政府对于美国这一侵略行动的抗议和完全合理的要求，因而破坏了举世瞩目的四国政府首脑会议。随着，日本岸信介政府也在美帝国主义的指使下，强迫日本众议院非法通过日美军事同盟条约。一年多以来，美国空军和海军不断侵犯中国的领空和领海。直到最近，这种侵犯行为已经达到一百次之多。这一系列破坏世界和平的侵略罪行，再一次使美帝国主义积极准备侵略战争的丑恶面目在世界人民面前暴露无遗。这些事实使全世界人民更加清楚地看到美帝国主义的本质，同时也进一步看清了那些一向伪装公正的帝国主义奴仆们的嘴脸。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府最近对美帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的严正措施。中国人民始终认为，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是血肉相连的整体。美帝国主义对任何社会主义国家的侵犯，就是对六亿五千万中国人民的侵犯，就是对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯，都必然在强大的社会主义阵营的铁拳下遭到双倍的还击。
    同志们，朋友们，我们正处在帝国主义走向崩溃、世界人民力量不断向前发展的伟大的新时代。这个时代的主要特点就是社会主义力量超过了帝国主义的力量，进步的力量超过了反动的力量，和平的力量超过了战争的力量。帝国主义横行霸道为所欲为的时代已经永远成为过去，它们无法阻挡历史车轮的前进，无法阻挡世界人民起来掌握自己的命运。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的风暴一天比一天猛烈，世界人民争取和平的斗争正在汹涌澎湃地发展，南朝鲜、土耳其和日本人民的正义斗争正在方兴未艾。全世界被压迫人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争正在蓬勃发展。帝国主义的寿命不会很久了。只要各国人民进一步团结起来，结成反对帝国主义的统一战线，主要是反对美帝国主义的统一战线，进行坚决的斗争，就一定能够击败帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。
    让我们两国人民紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略和争取世界持久和平作出坚持不懈的努力。
    最后的胜利是属于全世界爱好和平的人民的！
