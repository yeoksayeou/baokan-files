Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 21st: The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association held a banquet on the evening of the 20th to warmly welcome the Japanese literary delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma.

Shi Ximin, Alternate Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the banquet.

Zhang Chunqiao, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Foreign Cultural Association, spoke first at the banquet, warmly welcoming the Japanese friends to visit Shanghai. He said that we are not only colleagues but also close comrades-in-arms standing on the same front in the anti-American struggle. American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people and the number one enemy of the people of the world. In order to defeat this vicious enemy, we need to unite and support each other. We, the literary and art workers of Shanghai, like all the people of Shanghai and China, always regard the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle as our own struggle and always regard supporting the Japanese people's struggle as our sacred duty. We deeply admire the patriotic and progressive literary and art workers of Japan who stand together with the broad masses of the people and carry out an indomitable and heroic struggle. This friendly unity established and developed by our two countries' literary and art workers in the struggle against American imperialism is extremely noble. We are united today, and we will be united forever!

Zhang Chunqiao said that the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle has forced Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan indefinitely, which is a heavy blow to the reactionary forces of Japan and the United States. Now, the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to launch a frantic counterattack. On the one hand, it is intensifying its brutal persecution and bloody suppression of people from all walks of life in Japan; on the other hand, it has brazenly declared that the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" has been "naturally established." However, this criminal activity of the Japanese reactionaries is not a sign of its strength, but precisely a manifestation of its dead end and desperate struggle. It cannot but arouse the great indignation of the Japanese people and prompt the Japanese people to continue their efforts, advance on the crest of victory, and continue the struggle. The fact is that the Japanese patriotic and progressive forces have demonstrated with practical actions their determination to unite closely and carry the struggle to the end. We firmly believe that in the face of the united and awakened Japanese people, under the impact of the continuous struggle of the Japanese people, the reactionary forces of Japan and the United States are nothing but paper tigers and can be completely defeated. The Japanese people's struggle against the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" and against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government will surely be victorious, and the Japanese people's cause of striving for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality will surely be victorious.

Hiroshi Noma then spoke amid warm applause. He said that the Japanese people's struggle against the reactionary forces of Japan and the United States has achieved great victories. It has already forced the Kishi government to ask Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan. We clearly know that the Japanese people were able to achieve this great victory because they received the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. American imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people. We are grateful for the support and friendship given to us by the Chinese people—our friends in our common struggle.

Noma Hiroshi said that the Japanese people's struggle has entered a new stage due to the indefinite postponement of Eisenhower's visit. The struggle is long-term. The Japanese people must firmly maintain their fighting will until they achieve final victory. We believe that the united front formed by the Chinese and Japanese people will surely deal a fatal blow to American imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique.

Ba Jin, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, also spoke at the banquet. He wished that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people would continue to develop and consolidate, that the cultural exchanges between China and Japan and the friendly unity of the literary and art circles would continue to strengthen, and that the Japanese people would achieve greater victories in the struggle against American imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous group.

Sun Pinghua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, who accompanied the Japanese friends to Shanghai, also attended the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were: Xu Pingyu, Director of the Foreign Cultural Association in Shanghai; Su Buqing and Fei Fuquan, Vice Presidents of the Shanghai Branch of the Foreign Cultural Association; Shen Cuizhen, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation; Zhang Ruifang, Committee Member of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee in Shanghai; and well-known figures from Shanghai's literary and art circles, including Ye Yiqun, Kong Luosun, Hu Wanchun, Zhao Dan, Wei Heling, Huang Zongying, Shen Roujian, He Tianjian, Li Yuru, and Ding Shi'e.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji was also invited to attend the banquet.

    我对外文协和作协上海市分会
    欢宴日本文学家代表团
    新华社上海21日电　中国人民对外文化协会上海市分会和中国作家协会上海分会20日晚上举行宴会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团。
    中共上海市委书记处候补书记石西民出席了宴会。
    对外文协上海市分会会长张春桥首先在宴会上讲话，热烈欢迎日本朋友来上海访问。他说，我们不仅是同行，而且是站在一条战线上进行反美斗争的亲密战友。美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，也是世界人民的头号敌人。为了战胜这个凶恶的敌人，我们需要互相团结，互相支持。我们上海的文艺工作者，同全上海、全中国人民一样，始终把日本人民的反美爱国斗争当作自己的斗争，始终把支持日本人民的斗争当作自己的神圣义务。我们对日本爱国进步的文艺工作者，同广大人民群众站在一起，进行不屈不挠的英勇斗争，十分钦佩。我们两国文艺工作者在反对美帝国主义的战斗中建立和发展起来的这种友好团结，是极其崇高的。我们今天团结在一起，永远团结在一起！
    张春桥说，日本人民的反美爱国斗争，迫使艾森豪威尔不得不无限期地推迟对日本的访问，这是对日美反动派的一个沉重的打击。现在，岸信介政府正在企图发动疯狂的反扑。一方面变本加厉地对日本各界人士大下毒手，进行血腥镇压；另一方面，悍然宣布“日美安全条约”获得“自然成立”。但是，日本反动派的这种罪恶活动并不是它强大的表现，而恰恰是它穷途末路、绝望挣扎的表现。它不能不激起日本人民的极大的愤慨，促使日本人民再接再厉，乘胜前进，继续斗争。事实也正是这样，日本爱国进步力量，已经用实际行动，表明他们决心紧密团结起来，把斗争进行到底。我们坚信：在团结起来的、有觉悟的日本人民面前，在日本人民持续不断的斗争的冲击下，日美反动派不过是纸老虎，是完全可以被战胜的。日本人民反对“日美安全条约”、反对岸信介卖国政府的斗争一定会胜利，日本人民争取独立、和平、民主、中立的事业一定会胜利。
    野间宏接着在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，日本人民反对日美反动派的斗争，获得了巨大的胜利。已经迫使岸政府不得不向艾森豪威尔请求延期访问日本。我们清楚地知道，日本人民因为得到中国人民和世界人民的支援，才能取得这次斗争的巨大胜利。美帝国主义是日本人民和中国人民共同的敌人。我们对中国人民——我们共同斗争的友人们给我们的支持和友谊，怀着感激的心情。
    野间宏说，日本人民的斗争，由于迫使艾森豪威尔无限期延期访问，进入了新的阶段。斗争是长期的。日本人民必须坚定斗争的意志，直到取得最后的胜利。我们相信，中国人民和日本人民结成的统一战线，一定能够给美帝国主义与岸信介集团以致命的打击。
    作协上海分会主席巴金也在宴会上讲了话。他祝中日两国人民的友谊不断地发展与巩固，祝中日两国文化交流与文艺界的友好团结不断地加强，祝日本人民在反对美帝国主义和岸信介卖国集团的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
    陪同日本朋友来上海的中国人民对外文化协会副秘书长孙平化等也出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的还有：对外文协在沪理事徐平羽，对外文协上海市分会副会长苏步青、理事费福泉，上海市妇联副主任沈粹缜，中国亚非团结委员会在沪委员张瑞芳，以及上海文艺界著名人士叶以群、孔罗荪、胡万春、赵丹、魏鹤龄、黄宗英、沈柔坚、贺天健、李玉茹、丁是娥等。
    日本和平人士西园寺公一也应邀出席了宴会。
