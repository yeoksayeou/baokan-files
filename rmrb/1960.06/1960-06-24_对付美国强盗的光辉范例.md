    The Anti-American Storm in Asia: The Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea opens, welcoming thousands of visitors. On display here are various evidences of the aggressive nature of US imperialism, and more importantly, the heroic history of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies defeating the US imperialist paper tiger.

    Walking into the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum, people immediately see the evidence of the United States' premeditated launch of the war of aggression against Korea: US war-monger Dulles, on June 18, 1950, used a hairy, blood-stained claw on the 38th parallel, pointing at a military map, planning the invasion route. A few days later, on June 25, US imperialism launched the Korean War. Not only that, but the bandit face of US imperialism's attempt to dominate the world is also concentratedly exposed. Here are: the gangster statement issued by US President Truman on June 27, 1950, sending troops to invade the Korean War and ordering its Seventh Fleet to occupy our territory of Taiwan; a map of Asia published in the US "Time" magazine on September 8, 1950, which painted Taiwan as a large "key," undisguisedly revealing the US aggressors' seizing of Taiwan as the "key" for it to enter Asia; a map published by the US "Collier's" magazine revealing the US aggression plan, with five thick black arrows pointing directly at the Soviet Union, mainland China, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia from Alaska, Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The ironclad evidence is like a mountain, and the bandit face of US imperialism is criticized by thousands of people here.

    Who can but hate the monstrous crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea! Many pictures express the bloody tears of the Korean people, including: countless peaceful Korean towns turned into ruins under the bombs and gasoline barrels dropped by American aerial bandits; four hundred Korean mothers in Sinchon County were collectively burned to death by American bandits after being covered with straw and doused with gasoline; a 55-year-old Korean old woman and her 15-year-old young daughter were gang-raped and killed by American beast soldiers. The blood-stained black padded trousers of Grandpa Li, a resident of Andong City, who sacrificed under the American bombs, are displayed in a glass cabinet, still arousing people's deep-seated hatred for American bandits. "Blood debts must be repaid in blood!" In front of these pictures and cultural relics recording the atrocities of the US military, many viewers ignited the fire of revenge. Han Yuhuan, a mother of six children, was enraged when she saw the tragic scene of a Korean baby crying on the body of its mother killed by the US military in the exhibition hall, and said that she must punish the murderers and severely crack down on American bandits! Defend the children! Defend the mothers! Defend the peace!

    A large number of pictures, objects, and models made people recall the heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers crossing the Yalu River with high morale; recalled the moving scene of people of all ethnic groups across the country enthusiastically donating money to buy planes and artillery to support the Volunteers. Here is the washboard used by the family members of Anshan Iron and Steel workers to wash clothes and donate money, and the small bucket, carrying pole, and money-saving bamboo tube used by the 76-year-old Grandpa Tan Chuyun to collect water and save money for donations in his spare time. The Chinese people who stood up, together with the Korean people, stood on the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle and defeated the American aggressors.

    Chairman Mao told us that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum uses vivid facts to expose the true face of the US imperialist paper tiger to the audience. Under the strong blows of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, the myth of US imperialism's "invincibility" was shattered. In the exhibition hall, people saw a large number of objects and pictures reflecting the American invading army's embarrassing escape and annihilation under the powerful blows of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, and also saw the scene of an American general signing the Korean Armistice Agreement with his head drooping. In the more than three years of the Korean War, the American invading army used various killing weapons. Now, they are all exhibited here as historical evidence of the crimes and victories of the Chinese and Korean people. Among them are the wreckage of the latest American aircraft, artillery, and tanks, photos of sunken American cruisers, shells of germ bombs, and shells of heavy bombs, chemical bombs, and napalm bombs ranging from one hundred to one thousand pounds... Relying on these new weapons, the American aggressors destroyed countless cities and villages in Korea and killed countless unarmed Korean people. However, all this could not save its tragic fate.

    The Chinese and Korean People's forces used inferior equipment to defeat the ferocious enemy armed to the teeth. In the more than three years of the Korean War, more than 1.09 million enemy troops were annihilated. In the early days of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea, they used almost only rifles and hand grenades, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, to drive the American invading army, which was clamoring to end the Korean War before Thanksgiving, back to the 38th parallel, and annihilated more than 220,000 enemies. This world-shaking historical event is reflected today through pictures and objects from many famous battles such as Unsan, Changjin Lake, Hwangchoryong, Paik Un-san, and Feihu Mountain, giving the audience the feeling of being on the scene. In these battles, most of the US elite cavalry first division was annihilated, and the US "ace" Marine Corps first division was beaten into "severely disabled." The 31st regiment of the US 7th Division, which had been annihilated, had participated in two world wars. Now, the dirty regimental flag of this regiment has been stained with its own filthy blood and lies under the banner of the heroic company of our army. Chen Shengzhen, a volunteer company commander who had participated in the Battle of Changjin Lake and severely attacked the US 7th Division, could not help but say excitedly: "At that time, we were facing the world's number one imperialism, and we had to defeat it and eliminate it. We just remembered what Chairman Mao said that US imperialism is a paper tiger, so no matter what 'ace' enemy it was, the tiger skin of the US paper tiger was pierced by us at once!"

    During the Korean War, the American invading army frantically boasted about its so-called "air superiority" in an attempt to conquer the heroic will of the Chinese and Korean people, but all this also went bankrupt like a myth. A large number of objects and pictures on display in the exhibition hall show that it could neither cut off the steel transportation line of the Chinese and Korean people with the "strangulation warfare" nor prevent the victorious advance of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. Here is the milestone of the "317" section that was bombed into three sections by American aerial bandits - from September to December 1951, more than 3,000 bombs were dropped on a 5-kilometer section, with an average of 1.4 meters having one bomb; there are also the broken beams and rails of the Daedong River Bridge in Pyongyang that were bombed, and the "four-claw nails," "butterfly bombs," and "mother-and-child bombs" thrown on the road by American aerial bandits, and so on. However, the huge electric models of the "steel transportation line," "underground warehouse," and "underground hospital" shining with miraculous brilliance clearly tell people that the brave and resourceful Chinese and Korean people's soldiers created a steel transportation line that could not be blown up or broken, ensuring that the front line was full of grain and ammunition. There are also a large number of photos, "certificates," "survival certificates," and the "prisoner registration form" and aircraft wreckage of the American aerial bandits shot down by the young Volunteer Air Force and the powerful anti-aircraft artillery. It marks that the real advantage is on the side of the people's army, and the so-called advantage of US imperialism has gone bankrupt. Just as the famous Volunteer Air Force hero Zhang Jihui said when he came to visit this time, standing in front of the wreckage of the plane of the American "ace" pilot Davis that he shot down: At that time, although we were young, had little flight time, and lacked rich air combat experience, we were able to win the battle because we were armed with Mao Zedong Thought and had the support of the heroic people.

    People all over the world sing about Shangganling. The spirit of Shangganling still encourages people today to bravely fight against US imperialism. The exhibition hall uses prominent pictures, oil paintings, photos, objects, and models to reflect this great battle that lasted 43 days and nights, crushed more than 900 group attacks by the enemy, and annihilated more than 25,000 enemies. On display here is a box of rock powder, which comes from the top of Shangganling Mountain, where the American invading army poured more than 3.19 million shells and bombs, cutting the top of the mountain by two meters and blasting the rock into one meter deep powder. Among the objects are also the charred dead trees on Shangganling; the battle red flag of the "Iron Eighth Company" that held the tunnel for fourteen days and nights, overcame various difficulties, eliminated a large number of enemies, and captured the main peak of Shangganling in one fell swoop. The portrait of the immortal son of the motherland, martyr Huang Jiguang, his meritorious service book and family letters during his lifetime, as well as the crossbeam and soil where he used his body to block the enemy's bunker firing port, and the charred military uniform fragments of the great warrior Qiu Shaoyun, and the light machine gun used by the first-class hero Sun Zhanyuan are also on display here. These objects aroused deep mourning and respect from the audience, and aroused infinite hatred for the American aggressors. Zhang Xinyuan, the commander of the regiment where the hero Huang Jiguang was in, reported to the audience the heroic deeds of their regiment in defending the position for more than 30 days and nights in the Shangganling Victory and eliminating a large number of enemies. He said: The Shangganling battle has shown that any fierce weapon of US imperialism can never save its fate of defeat. It was our Chinese People's Volunteers and the heroic Korean People's Army who beat the American imperialists so that they lowered their heads in front of the people of the world and forced them to stretch out their hands stained with the blood of the people and sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    The American invasion of Korea ended in a shameful defeat. The last part of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum displays a large pile of colorful trophies. The American Stars and Stripes and the South Korean Lee Seung-man group's Taegeuk flag lie dismally next to a large number of weapons captured by our army. There are hundreds of various cap badges, collar badges, armbands, "medals" and "orders" of the invading American army and accomplice army and the Lee pseudo-army, all piled up in glass cabinets. Among them are the armbands and armbands of the five group armies and 26 armies and divisions of the American aggressors, as well as the headquarters of the Pacific Army, the headquarters of the Alaskan Army, and the European Regional Operations Command of the US military. Not far from it is a photo of the so-called "United Nations Army" Commander Mark Clark signing the Korean Armistice Agreement with his head drooping, as well as the English versions and translations of two books about the failure of the invasion of Korea written by him and his wife respectively. At the beginning of his book "From the Danube to the Yalu River," Clark helplessly admitted, "...I carried out the government's instructions and gained an unenviable reputation: the first American commander to sign an armistice that did not achieve victory."

    This is the shameful end of the American bandits. The great Chinese and Korean people and the people of Asian countries who are united and engaged in resolute struggle must drive the American bandits out of Asia.

    对付美国强盗的光辉范例
    新华社记者　周泽民　姜庆肇　程鹏
    中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆在亚洲反美大风暴中开馆，迎接着成千上万的观众。这里陈列着侵略成性的美帝国主义的种种罪证，这里更记载着中朝人民军队打败美帝国主义纸老虎的英雄史迹。
    走进抗美援朝战争馆，人们立即看到美国蓄谋发动侵朝战争的罪证：美国战争贩子杜勒斯1950年6月18日在“三八线”上用一只沾满血腥的毛茸茸的魔爪，指着军用地图，策划进攻路线。几天之后，也就是6月25日，美帝国主义就发动了侵朝战争。不仅如此，美帝国主义妄图独霸世界的强盗面目也集中地暴露出来。这里有：1950年6月27日，美国总统杜鲁门派兵投入侵朝战争和命令它的第七舰队霸占我国领土台湾的强盗式声明；美国“时代”杂志1950年9月8日刊载的一幅亚洲地图，把台湾画成一把大“钥匙”，毫不隐讳地透露了美国侵略者攫取台湾，作为它打进亚洲大门的“钥匙”；美国“柯里尔”杂志发表的透露美国侵略计划的地图，五支粗大的黑色箭头，从阿拉斯加，从日本，从冲绳，从台湾，从菲律宾，直指苏联、中国大陆、朝鲜、越南和蒙古。铁证如山，美帝国主义的强盗嘴脸，在这里受到千夫所指。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜犯下的滔天罪行，谁看了不切齿痛恨！许多图片表达了朝鲜人民的血泪控诉，其中有：在美国空中强盗所投的炸弹、汽油筒下，无数朝鲜的和平城镇变成了废墟；信川郡四百位朝鲜母亲，被美国强盗头盖干草、身洒汽油、集体烧死；五十五岁的朝鲜老大娘和她的十五岁的幼女被美国兽兵轮奸后杀死。牺牲在美国炸弹下的安东市居民李大爷血迹斑斑的黑夹裤，陈列在玻璃柜子里，至今还在唤起人们对美国强盗的刻骨仇恨。“血债要用血来还！”多少观众在记载美军暴行的这些图片和文物面前，燃起了复仇的怒火。六个孩子的妈妈韩玉环，在展览馆里看到朝鲜婴儿伏在被美军杀死的母亲身上哭叫的惨状时，激怒地说，一定要惩办杀人凶手，狠狠地打击美国强盗！保卫孩子！保卫母亲！保卫和平！
    展出的大量图片、实物和模型，使人们回想起了中国人民志愿军雄赳赳气昂昂跨过鸭绿江的英雄气概；回想起了全国各族人民踊跃捐款买飞机、大炮支援志愿军的动人情形。这里有鞍山钢铁工人的家属洗衣捐款用过的洗衣板，有七十六岁的谭楚云老大爷用工余时间挑水积资捐献用过的小筒、扁担和存钱竹筒。站起来的中国人民，和朝鲜人民一起，站在反帝斗争的最前线，打败了美国侵略者。
    毛主席告诉我们，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。抗美援朝战争馆用生动的事实，把美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎原形毕露于观众眼前。在中朝人民军队的坚强打击下，美帝国主义“不可战胜”的神话破灭了。在展览馆里，人们看到了反映美国侵略军在中朝人民部队的强大打击下狼狈逃窜和被歼的大量实物和图片，也看到了美国将军垂头丧气地被迫在朝鲜停战协定上签字的镜头。在三年多的朝鲜战争中，美国侵略军使用了各种杀人武器。现在，它们都作为历史的罪证和中朝人民的胜利品展览在这里。其中有美国最新式的飞机、大炮和坦克的残骸，有被击沉的美国巡洋舰的照片，有细菌弹的弹壳，有一百磅到一千磅的重型炸弹、化学弹和凝固汽油弹的弹壳……。美国侵略者凭借着这些新式武器，摧毁了朝鲜的无数城市和乡村，杀害了无数手无寸铁的朝鲜人民。但是，这一切都不能挽救它的惨败的命运。
    中朝人民部队用劣势的装备战胜了武装到牙齿的凶恶敌人。在三年多的朝鲜战争中，歼灭敌军一百零九万多人。中国人民志愿军在入朝初期，几乎只用步枪和手榴弹，配合朝鲜人民军，一直把狂叫要在感恩节前结束朝鲜战争的美国侵略军赶向三八线，并且消灭敌人二十二万多人。这个震撼世界的历史事件，今天通过云山、长津湖、黄草岭、白云山、飞虎山等许多著名战斗的图片和实物反映了出来，使观众们有如亲临其境。在这些战斗中，号称美国精锐的骑兵第一师大部被歼，美国“王牌”海军陆战队第一师被打成了“重残废”。被歼的美军第七师第三十一团，曾经参加过两次世界大战，现在，这个团的肮脏的团旗已被他们自己的污血涂染了，躺在我军英雄连队奖旗下。观众中一位曾经参加过长津湖战役、痛打美七师的志愿军连长谌盛侦，禁不住激动地说：“我们那个时候面对着世界上的头号帝国主义，要打败它，消灭它。就是记住了毛主席说的美帝国主义是纸老虎的话，因此什么‘王牌’敌人也不在话下，美国纸老虎的虎皮就一下子被我们戳穿了！”
    在朝鲜战争中，美国侵略军曾猖狂一时地吹嘘它的所谓“空中优势”，企图以此征服中朝人民的英雄意志，但是这一切也像神话般地破产了。展览馆里陈列的大量实物和图片，表明它既不能用“绞杀战”切断中朝人民的钢铁运输线，也没有阻止得了中朝人民军队的胜利前进。这里有被美国空中强盗炸成三段的
  “三一七”地段的里程碑——在1951年9月至12月，五公里的地段上落下炸弹三千多枚，平均一点四米就有炸弹一枚；也有平壤大同江桥被炸毁的残梁、断轨和美国空中强盗投掷在路上的“四爪钉”、“蝴蝶弹”、
  “子母弹”等等。但是，闪烁着奇迹般光辉的“钢铁运输线”、“地下仓库”和“地下医院”的巨大电动模型，清楚地告诉人们，勇敢机智的中朝人民战士，创造了一条炸不烂、打不断的钢铁运输线，保证了前线粮满库，弹满仓。被年轻的志愿军空军和强大的高射炮兵击落的美国空中强盗的照片、“证明书”、
  “求生证”，当时的“俘虏登记表”和飞机残骸等，也有一大堆陈列在这里。它标志着真正的优势在人民军队方面，美帝国主义的所谓的优势破产了。正如著名的志愿军空军英雄张积慧这次来参观时，站在他击落的美国“王牌”飞行员戴维斯的飞机残骸前所说的：那时候我们虽然年轻，飞行时间少，又缺乏丰富的空战经验，但是有毛泽东思想武装我们，有英雄人民的支援，我们就能够取得战斗的胜利。
    全世界的人民都歌颂上甘岭。上甘岭的精神，今天还在鼓舞着人们勇敢地同美帝国主义作斗争。展览馆里以显著的图片、油画、照片、实物和模型，反映了这一个激战四十三昼夜、打垮敌人九百多次集团攻击、消灭敌人两万五千多名的伟大战役。这里陈列有一盒岩石的粉末，它是来自上甘岭的山头上，那里被美国侵略军倾泻了三百一十九万多发炮弹、炸弹，把山头削低两米，把岩石炸成一米深的粉末。实物中还有上
  甘岭上被烧焦的枯木；有坚守坑道十四昼夜，战胜各种艰难、消灭大量敌人，并一举攻占上甘岭主峰的
  “钢铁第八连”的战斗红旗。祖国不朽的儿子黄继光烈士的遗像、生前的立功书和家信，以及他用身体堵住敌人地堡射击口地方的横木头和泥土，伟大战士丘少云烈士被烧焦的军衣碎片，一级英雄孙占元用过的轻机枪，也都陈列在这里。这些实物激起观众们深沉的悼念和敬意，激起了对美国侵略者的无限仇恨。当年英雄黄继光所在部队的团长张信元，向观众们报告了他们团在上甘岭大捷中坚守阵地三十多个昼夜，消灭了大量敌人的英雄事迹。他说：上甘岭战役已经表明，美帝国主义的任何凶恶武器都绝不能挽救它的失败命运。是我们中国人民志愿军和英雄的朝鲜人民军一起，把美帝国主义者打得在全世界人民面前低下头来，迫使他们不得不伸出沾满人民鲜血的手，在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。
    美国侵朝战争遭到了可耻的失败。抗美援朝战争馆的最后部分，陈列了一大堆五光十色的战利品。美国的星条旗和李承晚集团的太极旗，灰溜溜地躺在被我军缴获的大批武器的旁边。侵朝美军及帮凶军和李伪军的各种帽徽、领章、臂章、“奖章”和“勋章”，不下好几百件，也都堆在玻璃橱里。其中有美国侵略者的五个集团军、二十六个军、师及太平洋陆军总部、阿拉斯加陆军司令部、美军欧洲地区作战司令部的袖章和臂章等等。离它不远，是所谓“联合国军”总司令马·韦·克拉克垂头丧气地在朝鲜停战协定上签字的照片，以及他与他的妻子分别写的关于侵朝战争失败情况两本书的英文本和译稿。克拉克在“从多瑙河到鸭绿江”一书的开头，无可奈何地承认，“……我执行政府的指示，获得了一个不值得羡慕的名望：第一个在没有取得胜利的停战书上签字的美国司令官。”
    这就是美国强盗的可耻下场。伟大的朝中两国人民和团结起来进行坚决斗争的亚洲各国人民，一定要把美国强盗赶出亚洲去。
