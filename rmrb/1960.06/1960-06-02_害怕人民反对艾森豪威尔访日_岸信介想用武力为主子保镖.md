Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Tokyo News: According to today's "Tokyo Shimbun" evening edition, the Kishi Nobusuke government plans to dispatch the "Self-Defense Forces" to protect U.S. President Eisenhower during his visit to Japan.

As reported, due to the increasingly turbulent movement of the Japanese people opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the Kishi Nobusuke government and police authorities lack confidence in how to protect the U.S. President from encountering angry masses.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" said that the Kishi Nobusuke clique is increasingly worried about this issue, and they want to ask the "Self-Defense Forces" (i.e., the Japanese regular army) disguised as "honor guards" for help.

    害怕人民反对艾森豪威尔访日
    岸信介想用武力为主子保镖
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：据今天的“东京新闻”晚报揭露，岸信介政府打算出动“自卫队”保护来日本访问的美国总统艾森豪威尔。
    据报道，由于日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”和艾森豪威尔访问日本的运动日益汹涌澎湃，岸信介政府和警察当局对于如何保护美国总统避免遇上愤怒的群众的问题，缺乏信心。
    “东京新闻”说，岸信介集团对这个问题愈来愈担心，他们想向伪装成“仪仗队”的“自卫队”（即日本正规军）讨救兵。
