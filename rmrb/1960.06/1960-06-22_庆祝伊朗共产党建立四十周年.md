    Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of Iran
    Iran　Shamus
    Forty years ago, on June 22, 1920, amidst the surging national liberation movement in northern Iran, the first organized party of the Iranian working class – the Communist Party of Iran, with the program and charter of a new type of working-class party – was established, and its first congress was held. However, this does not mean that there were no political organizations of the Iranian working class before this. During the Iranian bourgeois democratic revolution (1905-1911), working-class political organizations existed in the form of scattered social democratic groups.
    However, it should be noted that the Iranian social democratic organizations lacked a unified leadership center, a unified program and charter, and these organizations were not united. Therefore, the establishment of the Communist Party of Iran in June 1920 should be considered the formation of a new type of working-class party in Iran.
    Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Iranian national liberation movement greatly developed from 1918. In 1920-1921, in the provinces of Gilan, Azerbaijan, and Khorasan in northern Iran, the national liberation movement had evolved into armed uprisings. The Communist Party of Iran actively participated in this revolutionary movement and played a leading role in the revolution in Gilan Province.
    Due to an incorrect understanding of the actual situation in Iran and some leftist actions taken because of this understanding, the revolution in Gilan Province fell into a critical situation. Finally, under the armed attack of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, the Gilan revolution was suppressed.
    A struggle was waged within the Communist Party of Iran against leftist elements, and leftist errors were condemned.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Iran analyzed the actual situation in Iran and published the party's program in the form of a "Outline on the Social and Economic Situation in Iran and the Tactics of the Communist Party of Iran." This was the first correct Marxist-Leninist analysis of the socio-economic situation in Iran at that time.
    The harsh political system made it impossible for the Communists to carry out activities among the broad masses of the people. However, the Communist Party was able to use its semi-public propaganda methods to propagate Marxist-Leninist ideas among a section of the people and absorb some workers and advanced elements into the party's underground organizations. During this period, the Communist Party was led by Dr. Taqi Erani, a loyal and outstanding son of the Iranian people.
    However, in 1937, the police discovered this organization and conducted trials on the so-called "Case of the Fifty-Three," headed by Dr. Taqi Erani. All Communist Party members were sentenced to death. Dr. Taqi Erani was brutally murdered in prison by reactionary executioners.
    Although the Communist Party of Iran did not become a strong social force during the dark autocracy of Reza Shah, it became a school for cultivating revolutionary cadres ideologically and organizationally. This group of revolutionary cadres later played an important role in establishing the new type of working-class party in Iran – the People's Party of Iran.
    The events of August 25, 1941 (on this day, Soviet troops entered Iran in accordance with the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty in order to expel the lackeys of fascist Germany; also on this day, British troops crossed the Iranian border from southwestern Iran), the forced abdication of Reza Shah, and Iran's formal declaration of war on fascist Germany were all the beginning of a new turning point in Iranian social and political life.
    On September 20, 1941, a new party of the Iranian working class – the People's Party of Iran – was formed. Communists, revolutionaries from various periods of the Iranian working-class party, and other progressive elements in Iran participated in this party.
    The People's Party of Iran is the inheritor of the revolutionary traditions of the Iranian people. Therefore, it quickly became the core of the most resolute fighters for the liberation of Iran. The People's Party of Iran included the democratic demands of the Iranian working people in its program. Therefore, in a very short period of time, it was able to gather vast numbers of workers, peasants, artisans, intellectuals, and people from other strata around it, transform itself into a large social force, and become the leader of the Iranian national liberation movement.
    From the beginning of its activities, the People's Party of Iran has regarded uniting all anti-imperialist forces in the country and striving to liberate the motherland from the direct and indirect influence of imperialism as the main purpose of the party. The party led and promoted the anti-imperialist struggle of the Iranian people.
    In the early years of World War II, the party directed the spearhead of the anti-imperialist struggle at fascist Germany. During this period, the People's Party of Iran also struggled against the conspiracies of American and British imperialism. British imperialists tried to establish a new dictatorship in Iran, prevent the expansion of the people's democratic movement, and maintain their interests in Iran, primarily the plunder of Iran's oil wealth. During the war, American imperialism also intensified its colonial activities in Iran. American troops invaded Iran, attempting to expand their economic and political influence in Iran, seize Iran's resources, and replace its opponent – British imperialism. During this period, the People's Party of Iran thwarted the realization of the conspiracies of British and American imperialism in Iran with unwavering struggle.
    In 1945-1946, the Iranian democratic movement swept the country. In 1945-1946, the two regions of Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan established local autonomous governments. The victory of the democratic movements in these two regions dealt a heavy blow to the Iranian reactionaries and greatly weakened the Iranian central government. During this period, the People's Party of Iran greatly strengthened its ranks and became a powerful mass political organization. Hundreds of thousands of peasants in the northern and southern regions of Iran participated in the peasant alliances led by the People's Party of Iran. In Isfahan County alone, more than 150,000 people participated in the alliance. In many counties, peasants openly refused to pay land rent. Armed peasants in Malayer County resisted the gendarmerie.
    During this period, the party's strength also entered the army. Underground party organizations were established in the army. Despite the extremely strict laws in the army, many officers joined the People's Party of Iran and conducted underground work in the army. An officer uprising broke out in the Khorasan region.
    However, the bloody attack of imperialism and Iranian reactionaries began. In December 1946, the government of Qavam al-Sultani, instigated by American imperialism, perfidiously attacked the democratic movements of the people of Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, drowning the democratic movements of the people of these two regions in blood, and then launched attacks on the organizations of the People's Party of Iran in other regions. The party's newspapers and magazines were banned. In 1949, the People's Party of Iran was declared illegal, and many leaders and members of the party were thrown into dark prisons. The interrogation of the leaders of the People's Party of Iran was another test for the party. The defense of the leaders of the People's Party of Iran turned into an indictment of the Iranian reactionaries, which expanded and strengthened the trust of the working people and progressive elements in the party.
    Since the party was declared illegal, the People's Party of Iran quickly transferred its organization to an underground state, with underground organizations spreading throughout the country. Only eight months later, the party's central organ – "The People's Newspaper" – was secretly published.
    Even under illegal conditions, the People's Party of Iran is a powerful political force in the country. The party combines underground work with legal work and has achieved great success in leading the anti-imperialist movement in Iran.
    The Iranian anti-imperialist democratic movement, under the influence of the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, and under the influence of the increasingly powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is moving towards a new upsurge.
    As everyone knows, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is the pillar of the Iranian reactionaries, the support point for British imperialism to interfere in Iran's economic and political affairs, manipulate the government, and exercise overall control over Iran, and a source of espionage and subversion. The Iranian people have been fighting against this company for many years. This struggle developed particularly vigorously at the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951.
    The vast majority of residents from all walks of life in the country participated in this struggle. The Iranian national bourgeoisie also actively participated in the movement for the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry. Dr. Mossadegh, the left-wing representative of the Iranian national bourgeoisie, fought resolutely to achieve this goal. Under the strong pressure of the people's movement, the Iranian parliament approved the law on the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry on March 15, 1951. This was a great victory for the Iranian people over imperialism. This victory inspired the broad masses of working people and strengthened the struggle against imperialism.
    The People's Party of Iran played an important role in the struggle for the nationalization of the oil industry. The People's Party mobilized the broad masses of Iranian working people to participate in the struggle against British imperialism and repeatedly exposed the aggressive nature of American imperialism and its collusion with the Iranian court to subvert the Mossadegh government. However, due to the wavering and lack of sufficient vigilance of the Iranian national bourgeoisie regime, on August 19, 1953, American and British imperialism finally engineered an anti-people military coup in Iran. This coup was carried out under the leadership of Allen Dulles, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and with the participation of U.S. General Schwarzkopf.
    Since this reactionary military coup succeeded seven years ago, the anti-democratic and national independence policies implemented by the traitorous Iranian authorities have aroused serious dissatisfaction among the Iranian people. The large-scale strikes held by Iranian workers in various places over the years, as well as the large-scale demonstrations by Iranian students supported by patriotic residents of Tehran, are proof of this dissatisfaction. These strikes and demonstrations, which have been subjected to bloody suppression more than once, also show that no force can suppress the people's movement for independence and freedom.
    The brilliant achievements of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the change in the balance of power on the international stage in favor of peace and socialism, the weakening of imperialism on a global scale and the disintegration of its colonial system, the vigorous development of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the upsurge of patriotic democratic movements in Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, which are currently under the rule of American imperialism, all of this creates favorable conditions for the development and victory of the Iranian people's national liberation movement. The main task of the People's Party of Iran now is to establish a revolutionary united front against American imperialism and its lackeys in Iran, including all democratic forces that can be united. The People's Party of Iran is fighting to achieve this task.
    The People's Party of Iran – the party of the Iranian working class, in the struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, will continue to carry out tireless and consistent struggles, utilizing its past beneficial experiences and the experiences of other fraternal parties, and will undoubtedly further strengthen its ranks, further strengthen the unity of thought and will, and will surely achieve a decisive and complete victory for the Iranian people over imperialist and reactionary forces.

    庆祝伊朗共产党建立四十周年
    伊朗　沙姆斯
    四十年前，1920年6月22日，在伊朗北部的高涨的民族解放运动中建立了伊朗工人阶级第一个有组织的政党——具有新型工人阶级政党的纲领和章程的伊朗共产党，同时，举行了第一次代表大会。但是，这并不是说，在此以前没有伊朗工人阶级的政治组织。在伊朗资产阶级民主革命时期（1905—1911年），工人阶级的政治组织曾以分散的社会民主小组的形式存在过。
    但是，应该说明，伊朗社会民主组织没有统一的领导中心，没有统一的纲领和章程，而且这些组织也不是团结一致的，因此，应该认为，1920年6月伊朗共产党的建立乃是伊朗新型工人阶级政党的形成。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，伊朗的民族解放运动从1918年起有了很大的发展，在1920—1921年，在伊朗北部的希利安省、阿塞拜疆省和豪拉森省，民族解放运动已演变成为武装起义。伊朗共产党积极参加了这种革命运动，并在希利安省的革命中起了领导作用。
    由于不正确地理解伊朗的实际情况和由于这种理解而采取的某些左倾行动，使得希利安省的革命陷入了危机的局势，最后，在帝国主义和国内反动派的武装进攻下，希利安的革命被镇压下去。
    在伊朗共产党内同左倾分子进行了斗争，谴责了左倾错误。
    伊朗共产党中央委员会分析了伊朗的实际情况，以“关于伊朗的社会和经济情况和伊朗共产党的策略”提纲的形式发表了党的纲领。这是对当时伊朗社会经济情况的第一次正确的马克思列宁主义的分析。
    恐怖严酷的政治制度使得共产党人没有可能在广大的人民群众中开展活动。但是，共产党能够以自己半公开的宣传方式在一部分人民中间宣传马克思列宁主义思想，并吸收了部分工人和先进分子加入党的地下组织。在这一时期，领导共产党的是伊朗人民的忠实和杰出的儿子塔吉·埃拉尼博士。
    但是，1937年警察发现了这一组织，并且对以塔吉·埃拉尼博士为首的所谓“五十三人案件”进行了审讯。所有共产党员都被判处了死刑。塔吉·埃拉尼博士被野蛮的反动派刽子手在监狱里杀害了。
    虽然伊朗共产党在礼萨王黑暗专制主义时期没有成为强大的社会力量，但是它却成为从思想上和组织上培养革命干部的学校，这批革命干部以后在建立伊朗新型的工人阶级政党——伊朗人民党中起了重要的作用。
    1941年8月25日事件（在这一天，苏联军队根据1921年签订的苏联—伊朗条约，为了驱逐法西斯德国的走狗而进兵伊朗；也在这一天，英国军队从伊朗西南部跨越伊朗国境），礼萨王被迫下台，伊朗对法西斯德国正式宣战，所有这些，都是伊朗社会生活和政治生活新转折的开端。
    1941年9月20日组成了伊朗工人阶级新政党——伊朗人民党。共产党人、伊朗工人阶级政党各个时期的革命者以及伊朗其他进步分子都参加了这个党。
    伊朗人民党是伊朗人民革命传统的继承者，因此，它很快就成为争取伊朗解放最坚决的战士的核心。伊朗人民党把伊朗劳动人民群众的民主要求列入了自己的纲领，因此，它在很短的期间内，就能够把广大的工人、农民、手工业者、知识分子和其他阶层的人民聚集在自己的周围，变成了一支很大的社会力量，并成为伊朗民族解放运动的领导者。
    伊朗人民党从开始自己的活动的时候起，就把团结全国一切反帝力量和争取把祖国从帝国主义的直接间接影响下解放出来作为党的主要目的。党领导和推动了伊朗人民的反帝斗争。
    在第二次世界大战的最初几年，党把反帝斗争的锋芒转向了法西斯德国。在这个时期，伊朗人民党同时也为反对美英帝国主义的阴谋进行了斗争。英帝国主义者力图在伊朗建立新的独裁政权，阻止人民民主运动的扩大，以保持它在伊朗的利益，而首先是对伊朗石油财富的掠夺。战争期间，美帝国主义也在伊朗加紧进行它的殖民主义活动。美国军队侵入伊朗，企图扩大自己在伊朗的经济影响和政治影响，攫取伊朗的富源并取代它的对手——英帝国主义的地位。在这个时期，伊朗人民党以坚定不移的斗争阻止了英美帝国主义在伊朗的阴谋计划的实现。
    1945—1946年，伊朗民主运动席卷全国。伊朗阿塞拜疆和库尔德斯坦两个地区在1945—1946年建立了地方自治政府，这两个地区的民主运动的胜利给了伊朗反动派以沉重的打击，并大大削弱了伊朗中央政府。伊朗人民党在这个期间大大壮大了自己的队伍，变成了强大的群众性政治组织。伊朗北部和南部地区数十万农民参加了伊朗人民党领导的农民联盟。仅在伊斯法汗一县就有十五万多人参加了联盟。在很多县里，农民都公开拒绝交付地租。马拉耶尔县的武装农民反抗宪兵。
    在这个时期，党的力量也进入了军队。在军队中建立了党的地下组织。尽管在军队中有极严厉的法令，还是有很多军官参加了伊朗人民党，并在军队中进行地下工作。在豪拉桑地区曾爆发过军官起义。
    但是，帝国主义和伊朗反动派的血腥进攻开始了。1946年12月，盖凡姆·苏尔达尼政府在美帝国主义的唆使下背信弃义地向伊朗阿塞拜疆和库尔德斯坦人民的民主运动进攻，把这两个地区人民的民主运动淹没在血泊中，接着向其他地区的伊朗人民党的组织发动了进攻。人民党的报纸杂志遭到了禁止。1949年伊朗人民党被宣布为非法，党的许多领导人和党员被投入阴暗的牢狱。对伊朗人民党领导人的审讯是对党的再一次考验。伊朗人民党领导人的辩护变成了对伊朗反动派的控诉书，它扩大和加强了劳动人民和进步分子对党的信任。
    自从党被宣布为非法以后，伊朗人民党十分迅速地把自己的组织转入了地下状态，在全国各地遍布地下组织。仅仅过了八个月，党的中央机关报——“人民报”便秘密地出版了。
    伊朗人民党在非法的情况下也是国内的一支强大的政治力量。党把地下工作和合法工作结合起来，在领导伊朗的反帝国主义的运动中取得了巨大的成就。
    伊朗反帝民主运动在中国人民民主革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立的影响下，在以苏联为首的日益强大的社会主义阵营的影响下，走向了新的高涨。
    大家知道，英伊石油公司是伊朗反动派的支柱，是英帝国主义干涉伊朗经济和政治事务、操纵政府和对伊朗进行全面控制的支撑点和间谍策源地。伊朗人民多年来进行反对这一公司的斗争。这一斗争在1950年底和1951年初特别蓬勃发展起来。
    国内极广大的各阶层居民参加了这一斗争。伊朗民族资产阶级也积极地参加了伊朗石油工业国有化的运动。伊朗民族资产阶级左翼代表摩萨台博士坚定不移地为达到这一目的而进行了斗争。伊朗国会在人民运动的强大的压力下于1951年3月15日批准了关于伊朗石油工业国有化的法律。这是伊朗人民对帝国主义的巨大胜利。这一胜利鼓舞了广大劳动人民群众，加强了反对帝国主义的斗争。
    伊朗人民党在争取石油工业国有化的斗争中起了重要的作用。人民党动员了伊朗广大的劳动群众参加了反对英帝国主义的斗争，并一再揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略本质及其勾结伊朗宫廷以颠复摩萨台政府的阴谋。但是由于伊朗民族资产阶级的政权的动摇和缺乏足够的警惕性，1953年8月19日美英帝国主义终于在伊朗策划了反人民的军事政变。这次政变是在美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯领导下和美国将军施瓦茨科普弗的参予下进行的。
    自从这次反动的军事政变得逞以后，七年于兹，卖国的伊朗当局所执行的反对民主和民族独立的政策，激起了伊朗人民的严重不满。这些年来，伊朗工人在各地举行的大规模罢工，以及得到德黑兰爱国居民支持的伊朗学生的大规模示威游行，就是这种不满的证明。不止一次遭到血腥镇压的这些罢工和示威游行还表明，任何势力也不能镇压人民争取独立和自由的运动。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的辉煌成就，国际舞台力量对比发生有利于和平和社会主义的变化，帝国主义在全世界范围内的削弱及其殖民体系的解体，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，特别是当前处于美帝国主义统治下的日本、南朝鲜和土耳其的爱国民主运动的高涨，所有这一切为伊朗人民的民族解放运动的发展和胜利创造了有利条件。伊朗人民党现在的主要任务是，建立包括一切可能团结的民主力量在内的、反对美帝国主义及其在伊朗的走狗的革命统一战线。伊朗人民党正在为实现这一任务而斗争。
    伊朗人民党——伊朗工人阶级政党，在反对帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争中，利用自己过去有益的经验和其他兄弟党的经验，继续进行不倦的始终如一的斗争，无疑地将更加加强自己的队伍，更加加强思想和意志的统一，必将取得伊朗人民对帝国主义势力和反动势力的决定性的彻底胜利。
