    Shanghai in a New Production Upsurge
    By our correspondent in Shanghai
    In Shanghai in June, a large-scale production campaign on the industrial front is in full swing everywhere. Since the spring, the colorful technical innovation and technical revolution movement has opened up a broad avenue for a substantial leap in production. As soon as June arrived, a great scene appeared on Shanghai's industrial front. Good news poured in from thousands of factories on both sides of the Huangpu River, and tens of thousands of workers achieved "one person doing the work of several." Many factories have already completed half of their annual production plans ahead of schedule...
    The situation of a substantial increase in production, which usually occurs after the autumn, has arrived ahead of schedule.
    Seizing High Yields: Cadres Go to the Front Lines
    Coming in from Wusongkou, the skies above several steel plants are filled with rolling smoke. In front of the blazing furnaces and beside the boiling molten iron, 100,000 steelworkers in Shanghai are engaged in a major battle to seize steel. In recent days, a large number of cadres have come to the front lines of the battle and are fighting alongside the workers.
    On the 1st, at 6:00 PM, cadres were holding a meeting in the office of the general party branch of the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. Suddenly, news came that after adopting new technology, the iron melting furnace No. 2 was melting iron very quickly, and the material transport workers were about to fall behind. At this crucial moment that determines the day's steel production, the general branch secretary immediately announced that the meeting would be temporarily suspended, and all those attending the meeting would go to the material yard to transport materials.
    A material transport commando team was formed in a few minutes. Leading the team was the workshop's general branch secretary. As soon as they arrived at the material yard, some cadres rushed to load iron blocks, and others pushed material carts towards the workshop. In the blazing red light, people were seen running back and forth. By this time, it was already past 10:00 PM, and some of the material transport workers had not yet eaten dinner. Seeing that the cadres' work clothes were soaked with sweat and they were still transporting materials, everyone refused to rest, saying, "Let's feed the iron melting furnace first, and after seizing high yields, we'll feed our stomachs." On the iron melting furnace, the tapping time was shortened from 50 minutes to 45 minutes, and streams of molten iron poured into the iron ladle. With more molten iron, the steelmaking furnace became even more tense. Several furnace chiefs calmly directed the loading, blowing, and rocking of the furnace. The blowing time for each furnace of steel was shortened from 30 minutes to 28 minutes, 26 minutes, 24 minutes... As soon as 12:00 AM arrived, the broadcast station immediately sent encouraging news to the entire workshop: the steel production for the day had broken through the 1,000-ton mark!
    Now, wherever there is difficulty, the cadres will appear. They not only work with the workers, but more importantly, they find many weak links and countermeasures to overcome them in the process of labor. A few days ago, the iron water in the Second Converter Workshop always lagged behind the converter. The general branch secretary, Guo Youshan, spent several consecutive days here studying measures with the workers. They found a problem with the No. 1 iron melting furnace. The No. 1 furnace was a famous "old master furnace" in the workshop. The same furnace always produced about half the amount of iron water as the other furnaces, dragging the converter down the most. That day, Guo Youshan held one meeting after another with the workers next to the old master furnace and took a series of measures. The next day, the melting rate of this furnace increased from about 10 tons per hour to 19.5 tons, shedding the title of "old master furnace" and earning the title of "red flag furnace."
    The sweat that the cadres and workers shed together has been exchanged for more molten steel. In early June, the city's steel production increased by more than 15% compared to the same period in May.
    Protecting Steel Commanders: Delivering Grain and Grass Thousands of Miles Away
    Woo, woo, woo... A train after train, whistling loudly, sped into Shanghai's Wusong Station, delivering "grain and grass" from all over the country to support Shanghai's steel plants -- pig iron, coal, limestone... This railway station, specially serving Shanghai's steel production, has been exceptionally busy since entering June.
    A new sign was hung outside an office at Wusong Station a few days ago, which read: "Wusong One-Dragon Coordination Office." Staff from the railway station, transportation bureau, and metallurgical bureau work together here every day to arrange the transportation of steel "grain and grass." The railway station allocates manpower for unloading, the transportation bureau's fleet promptly sends large trucks, and the metallurgical bureau also makes all preparations. They work closely together to ensure that pig iron, coal, and limestone from all over the country supporting Shanghai do not linger at the station for even a minute, and are transported to the blast furnaces and converters as quickly as possible.
    On the station's eleven loading and unloading lines, the long trains had just entered the station, and the switchman Shi Baosheng, holding red and green flags, immediately climbed onto the train to direct the locomotive to uncouple the cars. On the other side, a fierce battle to unload pig iron was underway, and new records for rapid unloading were constantly being set. The female workers of the youth group, who were family members of employees and had not been working for long, created a new record of unloading a 60-ton car of pig iron in half an hour, shortening the time by 20 minutes compared to the specified time. Beside the railway lines, the truck transportation workers, using the homemade cranes they created in the technical revolution, lifted net after net of pig iron and loaded it into trucks. The trucks, fully loaded with pig iron, left the station and headed straight for the steel plants.
    On another loading and unloading line, large cranes with booms 46 tons tall, like the arms of giants, deftly lifted transformers, crushers, fertilizer equipment weighing ten or tens of tons produced by Shanghai factories..., and placed them into the already empty train cars, ready to be transported to various places to support industrial and agricultural production.
    The workers on Shanghai's water and land transportation lines, like the workers at Wusong Station, put the task of transporting steel "grain and grass" first. From June 1st to 8th, the amount of pig iron transported to Shanghai by both water and land routes increased by 56.6% compared to the same period last month, preparing sufficient "grain and grass" for the new high tide of Shanghai's steel production.
    Seizing Raw Materials: Turning Waste into Treasure
    While the whole country transports raw materials thousands of miles to support Shanghai, Shanghai's workers also try every means to make every ton of raw materials play a greater role and make more products. The Taishan Chemical Plant, located in the new industrial zone in the western suburbs of Shanghai, is one of many such factories.
    In the Taishan plant, scenes of workers fighting to get raw materials and products from waste materials and scraps can be seen everywhere. To the north of the Aspirin workshop, in a tall chemical reaction kettle, a batch of a new product called acid anhydride, made from sugar essence scraps, has finished reacting. Workers stand on the high operating platform and use a long rubber tube to connect the liquid in the kettle to the cooler below. Soon, the liquid crystallizes into powder. The workers then process it twice to make a chemical raw material with important uses - an indicator. Its value is 17 times higher than that of acid anhydride. At the other end of the workshop, there is another scene. Several workers have just carried a reaction kettle, as tall as a person, into the workshop. The water jacket pipes have not yet been fully connected, and two other workers have pulled several buckets of raw materials in with rubber-wheeled carts. These raw materials were originally by-products of Aspirin. After being processed and refined here, they are made into a chemical reagent, which is even more valuable than Aspirin. In the laboratory of the Hemeisu Intermediate Raw Material Workshop, good news was also reported a few days ago. In the process of producing Hemeisu intermediate raw materials, there is a by-product that is not very useful. One day, several workers and technicians heard that it could be used to make a high-grade perfume called indole, and they were immediately excited. They did not have the experimental equipment at hand for a while, so they stood a long bench upright, nailed it to the experimental table, filled in a dozen bricks in the middle, and put together some rubber tubes, glass tubes, and asbestos to build a makeshift device. The first batch of indole was made. After inquiring, this kind of perfume cost more than 1,000 yuan per kilogram. These days, they are expanding this makeshift method to the workshop for mass production.
    The role of the same ton of raw materials is becoming increasingly larger in the Taishan plant. In the first five months of this year, the products they obtained from waste materials and scraps totaled more than 4 million yuan. By the end of May, they had completed 57% of the annual plan. As soon as June arrived, they broke the routine of "focusing on main products at the beginning of the month and comprehensive utilization at the end of the month," and adopted the method of launching both main and by-products together at the beginning of the month, using the production gaps of the main product equipment to comprehensively utilize waste materials and scraps. The entire plant is now working hard to increase its products by more than 5 million yuan through comprehensive utilization in June alone. This number is equal to the total output value of all main and by-products in January of this year.
Product Revolution: One Machine Replacing Several
    In the days of the Great Battle of June, the workers in Shanghai are not satisfied with the achievements made in the technical innovation and technical revolution in the past few months, and are still constantly innovating technology. Reforming product design is an important way to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Many instrument factories and machinery factories are revolutionizing their old products under the guidance of this idea. After the old products are drastically operated on, some can replace several, and some can even replace more than a dozen.
    Now in Shanghai, when anyone mentions product revolution, when they mention one replacing several, people will think of Yu Zhida, an ordinary worker. Not long ago, he jumped out of the circle of old products, performed an operation on the old products, and created a Chinese-style six-purpose high-temperature calibrator. Compared with the old products, labor is one replacing three, materials are one replacing four, and products are one replacing six. This incident quickly caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a call to young workers throughout the city to "learn from Yu Zhida, and everyone strives to replace several." Since June, a wave of "one replacing several" has been set off throughout the city. Thousands of workers are considering the question: "Can I achieve one replacing several?"
    Not to mention other factories, just the Kepei Instrument Factory where Yu Zhida works is lively enough. Whether it is male workers, female workers, old workers, or young people, every time they do something, they are trying their best to consider how to learn from Yu Zhida and catch up with Yu Zhida.
    Gong Xigen, a worker in the battery group in the same workshop and the same Youth League group as Yu Zhida, and who entered the factory in 1957, said at a group meeting one day: "If Yu Zhida can do it, why can't I do it?" This young man really does what he says. At this time, he was producing a standard battery, and he also put his mind to this product. After two days of hard work, he also successfully created a new type of miniature standard battery, and the materials achieved one replacing eight.
    In the calibration group, the last process of the entire factory, batches of temperature-measuring potentiometers about to leave the factory are neatly arranged, and the workers are calibrating them with a precision instrument. The branch secretary told reporters that if you had come earlier, you could have seen the original shape of this product. Now, this temperature-measuring potentiometer has undergone three reforms. The weight has been reduced from the original 12 kilograms to only 1 kilogram, and the number of parts has been reduced from 86 to only 22.
    The movement of Kepei Factory striving for one replacing several has exerted tremendous power in production. The entire factory produces a total of eight products, and now, all of them have been operated on. Some have been operated on twice, and some have been operated on six times. The products that have been operated on are all pocket-sized and ultra-small. The quality of some is exactly the same as in the past, and some are even better than in the past. Making these products saves labor, reduces materials, and processes quickly, so production is of course good. Since the beginning of this year, Kepei Factory has completed its plans ahead of schedule every month. By June 8, it has completed 59% of its annual plan. Compared with the same period last year, the entire factory has achieved one factory replacing three factories, and one person replacing three people.
    Battle of June: Welcoming a New Upsurge
    The technical revolution has brought fruitful results to production, and the leap in production has generated even higher aspirations. Hundreds of factories that have already completed their plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule and completed half of their annual plans are fighting the Great Battle of June while preparing for an even greater production upsurge in the second half of the year. In the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, you can feel this tense and enthusiastic atmosphere.
    To fight another beautiful battle in the second half of the year, we must start now. In the technical design section, although you cannot hear the rumbling of the machines in the workshop, you can see more than 100 designers working with all their attention. Rolls and piles of drawings tell people that the battle for the second half of the year has already begun here. The designers here have completed all the drawings and process data needed to manufacture steam turbine generators in the third quarter. In the various workshops, the workers are also formulating measures and thinking of ways to solve the weak links that exist in further increasing production in the second half of the year. In the DC motor workshop, which originally produced small motors, a high and large 250-ton press, the only one in the entire factory, has recently appeared. Why is such a large press needed to produce small motors? The workers told us that from the second half of the year, large motors will also be produced here. This press is a new piece of equipment that the workers made themselves in order to solve the problem of insufficient processing capacity...
    Seeing these things, one deeply feels that the first summer of the 1960s is another extraordinary summer. This summer foreshadows that more enthusiastic, more moving, and more fruitful scenes are yet to come!

    上海在新的生产高潮中
    本报驻上海记者
    上海的6月，工业战线上的大生产运动，到处热气腾腾。今春以来万紫千红的技术革新、技术革命运动，为生产大幅度跃进开拓了一条康庄大道。一进入6月，上海工业战线上就出现了一派大好景象，黄浦江两岸数千家工厂捷报频传，成千上万的工人实现了“一人顶几人”，许许多多的工厂已经提前完成了全年生产计划的一半……
    往年秋后，生产大幅度增长的形势已经提前到来。
    夺高产　干部上前线
    从吴淞口进来，几个钢铁厂的上空烟雾滚滚。在熊熊的炉火前，在沸腾的铁水旁，上海十万钢铁工人正在进行着一场夺钢大战。连日来，大批干部来到了战斗的前沿阵地，和工人一起战斗。
    1日，下午六点钟，上钢三厂第二转炉车间党总支的办公室里，干部们正在开会。忽然一个消息传来：二号化铁炉采用了新技术以后，铁水化得很快，运料工人快要跟不上了。在这决定一天钢产量的紧要关口，总支书记当场宣布会议暂时停止，参加会议的人们全部去料场运料。
    一支突击运料的队伍，几分钟内就组成了。带队的就是车间总支书记。一到料场，干部们有的抢着装铁块，有的推着料车向车间飞奔而去。在烈焰红光中，只见人们奔走如梭。这时时间已经十点多了，有些运料工人晚饭还没有吃，他们看到干部们工作服被汗水浸得湿透，还在运料，大家也不肯休息，都说：“先把化铁炉喂饱，夺得高产以后，再喂我们的肚子。”化铁炉上，出铁时间从五十分钟缩短到四十五分钟，一股股铁水奔腾地注入了铁水包。铁水多了，炼钢炉前更紧张起来了。几个炉长沉着地指挥着装料、鼓风、摇炉。一炉炉钢的吹炼时间从三十分钟缩短到二十八分、二十六分、二十四分……十二点钟一到，广播台马上给全车间送来了令人鼓舞的喜讯：这一天，钢产量突破了千吨大关！
    现在，只要哪里有困难，干部们就会在哪里出现。他们不仅和工人一起劳动，更重要的是他们在劳动中找到了许多薄弱环节和克服它们的对策。前几天，第二转炉车间铁水老是跟不上转炉，总支书记郭有善接连好几天在这里和工人一起研究措施。他们发现一号化铁炉上有问题。一号炉是车间里出名的老爷炉，同样一只炉子，铁水老是要比别的炉子少出一半左右，拖转炉的后腿它拖得最利害。这一天，郭有善在老爷炉旁边和工人们开了一次又一次会议，采取了一连串措施。第二天，这个炉子每小时熔化率就从原来十吨左右提高到十九吨半，脱掉了“老爷炉”的帽子，换上了“红旗炉”的称号。
    干部们和工人们流在一起的汗水，换得了更多的钢水。6月上旬，全市钢的产量比5月同期提高了15％以上。
    保钢帅　千里送粮草
    呜、呜、呜、……，一列列火车长鸣着驰进上海吴淞车站，送来了各地支援上海各个钢厂的
  “粮草”——生铁、煤炭、石灰石……这个专门为上海钢铁生产服务的火车站，进入6月以后显得分外忙碌。
    吴淞车站一间办公室的门口，前几天挂了一块新牌子，上面写着：“吴淞一条龙协作办公室”。火车站、交通运输局、冶金局的工作人员，天天在这里一起安排着钢铁“粮草”的运输工作。火车站上调配好卸车的人力，交通运输局的车队及时派来了大卡车，货物什么时候到就什么时候运，冶金局也做好了一切准备工作。他们紧密协作，让各地支援上海的生铁、煤炭、石灰石，不在车站上多耽搁一分钟，尽快地运送到高炉、转炉旁边。
    在车站的十一条装卸作业线上，这边长龙似的火车刚刚驶进车站，拿着红、绿旗的调车员石宝生立刻爬上火车，指挥机车解下车辆。另一边正在紧张地进行着卸生铁的战斗，快速卸车的新纪录不断出现。参加工作不久的职工家属青年组的女工们，创造了半小时卸一车六十吨生铁的新纪录，比规定时间缩短了二十分钟。在线路旁边的汽车运输工人们，开动在技术革命中自制的土吊车，吊起一网兜、一网兜的生铁，装进卡车。卡车满载生铁，离开车站，直奔钢铁厂。
    在另一条装卸作业线上，有几层楼高的起重四十六吨的大型起重机吊杆，像巨人的手臂，轻巧地吊起上海工厂生产的十几吨、几十吨重的变压器、破碎机、化肥设备……，放进已经卸空的火车车厢，准备运往各地支援工农业生产。
    上海水陆交通运输线上的工人们，都和吴淞车站的工人们一样，把运输钢铁“粮草”的任务放在第一位。从6月1日到8日，通过水陆两路运到上海的生铁比上月同期增加了56．6％，为上海钢铁生产新高潮准备了足够的“粮草”。
    抓原料　废物变珍宝
    全国各地千里迢迢把原料运来支持上海，上海的工人也千方百计地要每一吨原料，发挥出更大的作用，做出更多的产品。设在上海西郊新工业区的泰山化工厂，便是许多这样的工厂中的一个。
    在泰山厂里，到处可以看到工人向废料下脚要原料要产品的战斗场面。阿斯匹灵车间的北边，一个高大的化学反应锅里，一批用下脚糖精做的一种叫酸酐的新产品反应结束了。工人站在高高的操作台上，用一根长长的橡皮管，把锅里的液体通到了下面的冷却器里，只见阵阵热气四下飞散，不多时，液体便结晶成粉末。工人们再把它加了二次工，最后制成了一种有重要用途的化工原料——指示剂。它的价值又比酸酐提高了十七倍。在车间的那一头，又是一番情景。几个工人刚把一个有一人高的反应锅抬了进来，水汀管道还没有完全接好，又有二个工人把几桶原料，用胶轮车拉了进来。这些原料原来也是阿斯匹灵的副产品。它们在这里加工精制后，做成了一种化学试剂，价值比阿斯匹灵还高。合霉素中间体原料车间的化验室里，前几天也传出了一个喜讯。这个车间在生产合霉素中间体原料过程中，有一种副产品，用处不大。几个工人和技术员有一次听人说用它可以制造一种叫吲哚的高级香料，高兴得马上动手。手头一时没有试验设备，他们把一条长凳竖了起来，钉在试验台上，中间填进十几块砖头，凑上一些橡皮管、玻璃管、石棉，搭成了一个土设备。第一批吲哚做出来了，一打听，这种香料竟要一千多元钱一公斤。他们这几天正在把这套土办法扩大到车间里去大量生产。
    同样一吨原料，在泰山厂里发挥的作用越来越大了。今年头五个月，他们从废料下脚中取得的产品，加起来共有四百多万元，到5月底就已经完成了全年计划的57％。一跨入6月，他们打破了“月初抓主要产品、月底抓综合利用”的常规，采取主副产品月初一起上马的办法，利用主产品设备的生产空隙时间，来综合利用废料下脚。全厂现在努力在6月份一个月内，通过综合利用增加五百多万元的产品，这个数字等于今年1月份全部主副产品的总产值。
  产品大开刀　一台顶几台
    在大战6月的日子里，上海的工人并不满足前几个月的技术革新和技术革命已取得的成绩，仍在不断革新技术。改革产品设计，这是更能达到多快好省效果的一项重要途径。许多仪表厂、机械厂就在这种思想指导下，大革老产品的命。把老产品大动手术以后，有的一个要顶几个，有的甚至要顶上十几个。
    现在上海，谁提起产品革命，提起一顶几，人们便会想到于志达这个普通工人。前不久，他跳出了原来老产品的圈子，把老产品开刀动手术，创造了一种中国式的六用高温校验仪，和老产品相比较，人工一顶三，材料一顶四，产品一顶六。这件事情很快就轰动了整个上海。共青团上海市委向全市青年工人发出了“学赶于志达、人人都争一顶几”的号召后，6月以来，全市掀起了一个“一顶几”的热潮。成千上万的工人都在考虑着这样一个问题：“我能做到一顶几？”
    别的厂不说，单说于志达所在的科培仪器厂，就闹得够热火的了。不论是男工、女工，还是老工人、青年人，每做一件事，他们都在千方百计地考虑怎样学习于志达，赶上于志达。
    和于志达同一个车间，同一个团小组，而且是同在1957年进厂的电池小组工人龚锡根，有一天在小组会上说：“于志达能做到的，我为什么做不到？”这个小伙子真是说得到做得到。这时候，他正在生产一种标准电池，他在这个产品上也大动起脑筋来了。经过二天的奋战，结果也创造成功了一种新式的微型标准电池，材料做到了一个顶八个。
    在全厂最后一道工序的校验小组里，一批批即将出厂的测温电位差计整齐地排列着，工人们正在用一种精密的仪器进行校验。支部书记对记者说，你们要是早些时候来，还可以看到这种产品的原形。现在这种测温电位差计，已经经过了三次改革，重量从原来的十二公斤减轻到只有一公斤，零件过去要八十六种，现在只有二十二种了。
    科培厂人人力争一顶几的运动，在生产上发挥了巨大的威力。全厂一共生产八种产品，到现在，全都被开过刀，少的开过两次，多的开过了六次。动过手术的产品，都是袖珍式的，超小型的。质量有的完全和过去一样，有的甚至比过去还好。做这些产品，省人工，材料少，加工快，生产当然好。科培厂今年以来，月月提前完成计划，到6月8日止，已经完成了全年计划的59％。和去年同期相比，整个厂做到了一个厂顶三个厂，一个人顶三个人。
    战六月　迎接新高潮
    技术革命给生产带来了丰硕的果实，生产跃进又使人们产生了更高的愿望。几百个已经提前完成上半年计划和完成全年计划一半的工厂，正在一边大战六月，一边秣马厉兵，迎接下半年更大的生产高潮的到来。在上海电机厂里，就可以感染到这种紧张热烈的气氛。
    要在下半年再打一个漂亮仗，眼前就要动手。技术设计科里，虽然听不到车间里那些隆隆的机器声音，看到的只是一百多个设计人员在全神贯注地进行设计工作。一卷卷、一堆堆的图纸告诉人们：下半年的战斗早已在这里打响了。这里的设计人员已经把第三季度制造汽轮发电机所需要的图纸、工艺资料全部设计完成。各个车间里，工人们也在订措施、想办法来解决下半年生产进一步提高所存在的薄弱环节。在原来生产小型电机的直流电机车间里，最近出现了一台又高又大、全厂唯一的二百五十吨大压床。生产小型电机何必要用这样大的压床呢？工人们告诉我们：从下半年开始，这里也要生产大型电机了。这台压床便是工人们为了解决加工能力不足，亲自动手做出来的新设备……
    看到这些，使人深深感到：六十年代的第一个夏天，又是一个不平凡的夏天。这个夏天预示着：更热烈、更动人、更大丰收的场面还在后头哩！
