In Praise of Our Heroic Era
Guo Nai'an

    The Central Conservatory of Music recently performed two large choruses created collectively by students of the institute in Beijing: "For the Sixty-One Class Brothers" and "Heroic Boy Liu Wenxue." These two works were performed in March, and this performance has been revised somewhat. The creation and performance of these two large choruses is a very exciting thing in our musical life. Because it shows that musical creation can quickly reflect the new heroes and new events of our era. The key issue is whether music workers have the drive, whether they have liberated their minds, and whether they rely on the leadership of the Party and believe in the power of the collective.

    Numerous heroic deeds that demonstrate the unprecedented high tide of the communist spirit of the people in the great Mao Zedong era have deeply moved and educated our people, and also inspired the creative enthusiasm of these young music students. These two large choruses were created under the leadership of the Party Committee of the institute, giving full play to the soaring drive and spirit of great collaboration, and completed in a few days and nights of hard work. The Party Committee's close concern, the teachers' enthusiastic help, and the collectivist spirit and drive of all the students ensured that the entire process from creation to performance could be completed at high speed. When they didn't have lyrics, they created them themselves; some of them had just started learning composition, but they also bravely tried to write such large-scale works. The creators set a completion time, the performers made guarantees, and the Young Pioneers of the attached middle school also gave up their rest. The entire institute was filled with enthusiasm. The communist style has developed among young students, which shows the brilliant victory of the education revolution under the guidance of our Party's education policy.

    Although these two large choruses inevitably have some shortcomings, they both demonstrate the authors' high enthusiasm for new communist things and their respect for heroic figures.

    The event of rescuing the sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu originally had dramatic plots. However, the authors of "For the Sixty-One Class Brothers" did not focus their attention on the dramatic depiction of the plot, but seized the key links of the event, and expressed the communist style of "one person in trouble, ten thousand help, one place in trouble, the whole country helps"; and in these links, they focused on expressing people's spirit rather than the appearance of the event, and finally led to the praise of the Party and Chairman Mao. This creative intention has given this work considerable success.

    In this large chorus, the most touching part is "The Party, Reborn Parents." This piece of music draws on the tunes of northern Shaanxi folk songs, and is written in a simple, sincere, and moving way, appropriately expressing the rescued workers' gratitude to the Party, as well as the gratitude of the people of the whole country to the Party. The final ode "Great Party," although, as some comrades said, its musical presentation is not nationalized enough, its enthusiasm is full and can still give people a vivid impression. In addition, the boatman's song describing crossing the Yellow River at night is also full of enthusiasm and power, but it is slightly lacking in depth.

    From a general point of view, it should be affirmed that this large chorus abandons the description of the plot and focuses on writing about the spiritual aspects of people. However, when writing about the spiritual aspects of people, some passages weaken the vividness and appeal of the music due to the lack of some characteristic emotional descriptions. The most prominent example is the passage describing the People's Air Force's night flight to drop medicine. Using a march to express it fails to deeply and vividly express the People's Air Force's calm, firm, and heroic spirit in overcoming the various difficulties of night flight in mountainous areas in order to rescue class brothers. If these shortcomings are revised, this work will be even more successful.

    "Heroic Boy Liu Wenxue" is a collective creation by first-year students of the Composition Department of the institute. Although they are students who are just beginning to learn composition, they have achieved outstanding achievements in the creation of this large-scale work. The music of the entire work is written in a simple and energetic style, with natural enthusiasm, in line with the state of mind of young people, and more powerfully expresses the praise for the heroic teenager. The most moving parts of this work are the description of Liu Wenxue's fearless threat from the landlord and bravely fighting with the landlord to the point of sacrifice, and the final hymn. In the previous section, the tune of the Young Pioneers' song was appropriately quoted, portraying the noble spirit of this heroic boy. Both of these sections have achieved exceptionally touching effects.

    A relatively weak part of this large chorus is the solo part describing Liu Wenxue's life and character. Although the performance of this part is also worse, the creation itself has not been able to portray Liu Wenxue's character and spirit more vividly and clearly, and has not more deeply revealed the spiritual outlook of this young hero. If Liu Wenxue can be written more vividly in this part, and first leave a kind and lovely impression in the listener's mind, then the description of his fighting with the landlord to the point of sacrifice will inevitably gain greater touching power.

    In short, although these two works still have individual shortcomings, they both make realistic reflections of these heroic deeds to varying degrees, and in particular, they can more prominently and powerfully express the authors' high enthusiasm for these events full of communist spirit, as well as their love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and their firm belief in the socialist system and communism.

    What is particularly important is that through the creation and performance of these two works, we can clearly see the enthusiasm of the young students of the Conservatory of Music for the communist cause, as well as their new attitude towards music work. The past idea of treating music as a personal pursuit of fame and fortune is gradually being eliminated, and the new concept of treating music as the cause of the whole people, the cause of the collective, and the cause of the revolution is rapidly growing. It is precisely because of this that they have such a soaring drive and can complete the tasks of creation and rehearsal in a very short time; they have the courage to do things they have never done before; they have the communist spirit of cooperation to take the initiative to help others; and it is precisely because of this that they do not treat creation with an attitude of "making a splash," but believe in the wisdom and power of the collective, improve the work in collective discussions, and put the work in front of more audiences to ask for their criticism and absorb their opinions for revision. From here, we can see how the young musicians of the great Mao Zedong era have received profound education from these moving heroic events and obtained the source of inspiration and power for musical creation. The completion of these creations proves that under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command and relying on the collective strength of the masses, musical creation can also leap forward at a much greater speed. It also proves that musical creation can quickly reflect our great era, and should also quickly reflect this great era.

    歌颂我们英雄的时代
    郭乃安
    中央音乐学院最近在北京演出了该院同学集体创作的两大合唱：《为了六十一个阶级弟兄》和《英雄少年刘文学》。3月间这两部作品就曾经演出过，这次的演出又作了若干修改。这两首大合唱的创作和演出，是我们音乐生活中一件十分令人兴奋的事情。因为它表明了音乐创作是能够很迅速地反映我们时代的新英雄，新事件的。关键问题在于音乐工作者是否有干劲，是否解放了思想，是否依靠党的领导和相信集体的力量。
    许许多多表现了伟大的毛泽东时代人民群众的共产主义精神空前高涨的英雄事迹，给我国人民以深刻的感动和教育，也激发了这些青年的音乐学生们的创造热情。这两部大合唱，都是在学院党委的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲和大协作的精神，经过日夜的奋战，在短短几天的时间里完成的。党委的亲切关怀，教师的热心帮助，全体同学的集体主义精神和干劲，保证了从创作到演出的整个过程能以高速度来完成。他们没有歌词，就自己动手创作；他们有的还刚学作曲，也勇敢地尝试写这样大型的作品。创作者定出了完成的时间，演出者提出了保证，附中的少先队员们也放弃了休息，整个学院热情沸腾。共产主义风格在青年学生中间发展起来了，它表明了在我们党的教育方针指导下，教育革命的辉煌胜利。
    这两首大合唱虽然都不免还有某些缺点，但是它们都表现了作者们对于共产主义新事物的高度热情，以及他们对于英雄人物的崇敬。
    抢救平陆六十一个阶级弟兄的事件经过，原是富于戏剧性情节的。但是，“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的作者们并没有把他们的注意力放在情节的戏剧性描写上面，而是抓住这一事件的几个重要环节，通过它们表现出一人有事万人帮，一地有事全国帮的共产主义风格；并且在这几个环节中着重表现了人们的精神而不是事件的外表，最后引到对党和毛主席的歌颂。这样的创作意图使这一作品获得了相当的成就。
    在这首大合唱中，感人最深的是“党，再生的爹娘”一段。这段音乐吸取了陕北民歌的音调，写得朴素、恳挚而动人，恰当地表现了被救民工对党的感激心情，也是全国人民对党的感激心情。最后的一段颂歌“伟大的党”，虽然像有的同志所说的在音乐的陈述方式上还有些不够民族化，但它的热情却是充沛的，也还能给人以鲜明的印象。此外，描写夜渡黄河的那段船夫曲，也是充满热情和力量的，只是在深度上略嫌不够些。
    从总的方面看，这首大合唱撇开了情节的描叙，而着重去写人们的精神方面，这是应该肯定的。但是在写人们的精神方面的时候，有的段落由于缺乏一些具有特性的感情描写，因而减弱音乐的生动性和感染力，比较突出的是写人民空军夜航投药的一段，用一首进行曲来表现，就未能深入和生动地表现人民空军为了抢救阶级弟兄而克服山区夜航的种种困难的沉着、坚定和英雄气概。如果这些不足之处经过一些修改，当能使这一首作品获得更大的成功。
    《英雄少年刘文学》是该院作曲系一年级同学的集体创作，他们虽是初学作曲的学生，但在这一大型作品的创作中却取得了突出的成就。整个作品的音乐写得朴素而有朝气，自然中洋溢着热情，切合少年的情态，比较有力地表达了对于英雄少年的歌颂。这一作品写得最动人的地方，是描述刘文学不惧地主的威胁而勇敢地和地主搏斗以至牺牲的一段，以及最后的颂歌部分。在前面那一段中，恰当地引用了少先队队歌的曲调，刻划了这位英雄少年的崇高的精神。这两部分都取得了异常感人的效果。
    这首大合唱中比较弱的一部分是描写刘文学的生活和性格的独唱部分。虽然这部分的演唱也要差些，但就创作本身来说，也还没有能够把刘文学的性格和精神更生动、更鲜明地刻划出来，还没有更深地揭示这位少年英雄的精神面貌。如果在这一部分能够把刘文学写得更生动些，首先在听者心中留下亲切可爱的印象，那末，后面他和地主搏斗以至牺牲的描述，必然会获得更大的感人力量。
    总之，这两个作品虽然还有个别不足之处，但都对这些英雄事迹作了不同程度的真实反映，特别是都能比较突出有力地表达了作者们对待这些充满共产主义精神的事件的高度热情，以及对党和毛主席的爱戴，对社会主义制度和共产主义的坚定信念。
    特别重要的是：通过这两个作品的创作和演出，使我们清楚地看到了音乐学院的青年同学们对共产主义事业的热情，以及对音乐工作的新态度。过去那种把音乐事业作为个人谋取名利的事情的思想已在逐渐消灭，而把音乐作为全民的事业、集体的事业、革命的事业的新观念正在迅速地成长。正是这样，他们才会有那样冲天的干劲，在很短的时间内完成创作和排练的任务；才会有那样做自己还不曾做过的事情的勇气；才会有那种主动地帮助别人的共产主义协作精神；也正是这样，才会是不用“一鸣惊人”的态度来对待创作，而是相信集体的智慧和力量，在集体的讨论中提高作品，并把作品放在更多的听众的面前去请他们批评，吸取他们的意见进行修改。从这里我们可以看出伟大毛泽东时代的音乐青年是怎样从这些动人的英雄事件中受到深刻的教育，取得音乐创造的灵感和力量的源泉。这些创作的完成，证明在党的领导下，政治挂了帅，依靠群众的集体力量，音乐创作也能以更大得多的速度跃进。同时也证明了，音乐创作是能够迅速反映我们伟大的时代，而且也应该迅速地反映这个伟大的时代。
