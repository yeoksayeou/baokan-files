Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: "Democracy Korea Daily" published an editorial today saying: The Korean people absolutely cannot stand idly by while the American imperialists collude with the revived Japanese militarists and openly move further down the road of aggression against Asia.

The editorial pointed out that the criminal act of the US-Japan reactionary clique announcing the "entry into force" of the US-Japan military alliance treaty seriously threatens the peace and security of Korea and is a blatant provocation to peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial said that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries shows that it is not the US-Japan reactionaries, but the Japanese people who determine the fate of the Japanese people. The Japanese people, who have risen up to carry out an anti-American patriotic struggle, are advancing victoriously.

The editorial said that the people of the world express infinite respect and sympathy for the Japanese people who are carrying out the anti-American patriotic struggle. The struggle of the Japanese people is arduous and tortuous. However, as long as they further unite and wage a tenacious struggle with the support of the people of Asia and the people of the world, the Japanese people will surely be able to achieve the final victory of crushing the US-Japan military alliance and driving out the American aggressors.

The editorial emphasized that the Korean people, together with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people of the world, once again strongly advocate that US troops must withdraw from Japan and all regions of Asia, remove US military bases, establish nuclear-weapon-free peace bases in Asia, declare the illegal US-Japan military alliance treaty invalid, and make Japan an independent, peace-loving, and neutral country.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 23rd: A recent editorial in the Indian "New Century" weekly said that the struggle of the Japanese people "is helping to destroy the entire chain of American military alliances surrounding the world."

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese people "are giving new confidence to all patriots in other Asian and African countries who, like the Japanese people, are also faced with the task of uniting and overthrowing their own reactionaries who are colluding with the US-led imperialist camp." The editorial said that the Japanese people are using their unity to strive for the establishment of a progressive democracy in their country and contribute to the cause of world peace. The great battle is continuing, and there is no doubt that the Japanese people will win.

The editorial paid tribute to all patriotic parties, workers, and youth in Japan and said, "We pay tribute to our brother party, the Japanese Communist Party, which has contributed everything to this epoch-making struggle."

The editorial concluded, "The imperialist bloc is panicked. But the people of the world are rejoicing. The cause of Asian solidarity and world peace is gaining new strength. Eisenhower was publicly humiliated. The prestige of American imperialism is further discredited. Long live the Japanese people."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 18th: The Burmese "Vanguard" newspaper published an editorial on the 18th saying that the Japanese people will continue to struggle until the US-Japan military alliance treaty is abolished.

The newspaper pointed out, "The Japanese people have realized that the new US-Japan Security Treaty will not only make Japan a permanent US military base, but will also make Japan hostile to its Asian neighbors. Therefore, it is entirely possible that it will be isolated from other countries. Moreover, because of its dependence on the United States, Japan will become completely enslaved by the United States. It is for this reason that the Japanese people are so strongly opposed to the new US-Japan Security Treaty."

    “民主朝鲜报”和印度“新世纪”周报说
    日本人民定获最后胜利
    新华社平壤25日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表社论说：朝鲜人民对美帝国主义者同复活的日本军国主义者互相勾结、公然进一步走上侵略亚洲的道路，绝不能袖手旁观。
    社论指出，美日反动集团宣布日美军事同盟条约“生效”的这种犯罪行为，严重地威胁着朝鲜的和平和安全，并且是对亚洲和世界和平的粗暴的挑衅。
    社论说，日本人民为反对美日反动派的阴谋而进行的英勇斗争说明：决定日本人民命运的不是美日反动派，而是日本人民。起来进行反美爱国斗争的日本人民正胜利前进。
    社论说，全世界人民对进行反美爱国斗争的日本人民表示无限的敬意和同情。日本人民的斗争是艰苦的、曲折的。但是只要在亚洲人民和全世界人民的支持下进一步团结起来进行顽强的斗争，日本人民必将能够取得粉碎日美军事同盟、赶走美国侵略者的最后胜利。
    社论强调说，朝鲜人民同日本人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，再一次强硬主张：美军必须从日本和亚洲的一切地区撤走，撤除美国军事基地，在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平基地，宣布非法的日美军事同盟条约无效，使日本成为独立的爱好和平的中立的国家。
    新华社新德里23日电　最近一期印度“新世纪”周报发表社论说，日本人民的斗争“正在帮助摧毁包围全世界的美国军事同盟的整个锁链”。
    社论指出，日本人民“给予其他亚非国家的一切爱国人士以新的信心，他们同日本人民一样，也面临着团结起来、打倒同以美国为首的帝国主义阵营勾结在一起的本国反动派的任务”。社论说，日本人民正以自己的团结，争取在本国建立进步的民主，为世界和平事业贡献出自己的力量。伟大的战斗正在继续中，毫无疑问，日本人民将会取得胜利。
    社论向日本所有的爱国政党、工人和青年致敬，并且说，“我们向我们的兄弟党日本共产党致敬，他们在这场划时代的斗争中，贡献出了它的一切。”
    社论最后说，“帝国主义集团惊惶失措。而全世界人民却欢欣鼓舞。亚洲团结和世界和平的事业正在取得新的力量。艾森豪威尔当众受辱。美帝国主义的威信更趋扫地。日本人民万岁。”
    新华社仰光18日电　缅甸“先锋报”18日发表社论说，日本人民将继续进行斗争，直到日美军事同盟条约被废除时为止。
    这家报纸指出，“日本人民已经认识到，新日美安全条约不仅将使得日本永远成为美国的军事基地，而且将使得日本敌视它的亚洲邻国。因而，本有一切可能从其他国家中孤立起来。而且由于依赖美国，日本将完全成为美国的奴隶。正是为了这个原因，日本人民才这么强烈地反对新日美安全条约。”
