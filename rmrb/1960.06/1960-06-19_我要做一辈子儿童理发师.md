    I want to be a children's hairdresser for life
    Zhang Zhirong, Hairdresser, "Red Children's Beauty Salon," Qixinggang People's Commune, Chongqing

    Perhaps many people have seen the scenes in the film "Spring Colors Fill the Mountain City," which reflects Chongqing's Great Leap Forward, featuring the "Red Children's Beauty Salon" of the Qixinggang People's Commune: In a beauty salon equipped with automatic rocking horses, tanks, cars, rabbits... little customers are attracted by the various toys. They happily play with the various toys and look at picture books while waiting for a haircut; there is a young hairdresser, only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, comfortably giving a child a haircut. This is our "Red Children's Beauty Salon" and my work situation...

    Speaking of the origin of the "Red Children's Beauty Salon," it's a bit long-winded. It was on the evening of early February this spring when we listened to a report by the Party branch secretary. The report talked about how commercial workers should further organize the people's economic life and asked everyone to think of ways to improve their work from all aspects to better serve the people. After listening to the report, I lay in bed that night racking my brains: I started learning hairdressing at the age of twelve in the old society; now I am twenty-eight years old, and I have been doing it for sixteen years. Over the years, I have found that children's hair is the most difficult to cut. Children are reluctant to enter the barber shop. Even if they do, they cry or make a fuss as soon as they sit on the barber's chair, jumping around so much that adults have to hold them down and force them to get a haircut. If you are not careful, you might even cut them and draw blood. It's rare to have a smooth haircut. If I could come up with a way to make the children not cry or make a fuss and get their hair cut obediently, that would be great! Thinking of this, I, like hairdressers and people in all kinds of professions, am respected by the people. After thinking it over, my enthusiasm grew even more, and I decided to set up a barber shop dedicated to serving children.

    After thinking it over that night, I ran to ask the Party branch the next day. The comrades of the branch all said, "That's great, it's a reform, and it must be done immediately." And they entrusted me with the task. I had come up with the idea, but I didn't know how to do it. After thinking for a while, my usual work inspired me: Not long ago, I went to the nursery of an organization to cut hair and saw that the children were very interested in those rocking horses and cars. Once they climbed on them, they didn't want to get down. The children's barber chairs should be made into the shape of toys, and the children would definitely welcome them. So, I immediately ran to the nursery to see how the toys were made. After looking at them, I discussed it with the masses, and they all said it was a good idea. The other hairdressers were also very enthusiastic and said that they would do it. Some said that they should ask a carpenter to make the chairs. I said, this is a reform, and we must be thrifty. We should learn to do it ourselves. If it doesn't work, we can tear it apart and start over. Everyone thought I was right and started to work. The three of us went to ask an artist to draw the patterns, find the wood, repair and decorate the storefront, acting as carpenters and plasterers, doing everything ourselves. That's how we worked day and night, and in two days, we made small chairs in the shape of rocking horses, cars, rabbits, and so on. Who knew that the small seats were made of wood and could not be raised, lowered, or rotated. After discussing it, everyone decided to improve them and went to the workers of the Anchang Machine Factory in the area to ask for advice and went to Hualongqiao in the suburbs to cast automatic iron seat stands. Casting didn't take much effort because the workers were very supportive; but it was not easy to transport them back. I went to get the stands, and I didn't expect that ten stands weighed more than two hundred pounds. The ticket seller said it was too heavy and wouldn't let me take the bus. I thought, I'll carry them myself. But after walking a few steps, I couldn't move anymore. I suddenly thought of taking the method of walking a section and then sending another section, carrying two stands in one hand and walking a section, putting them down, and then coming back to transport the rest. Like this, I went back and forth, from twelve o'clock at noon to eight o'clock in the evening, and finally transported the ten iron stands back from Hualongqiao in the suburbs. Seeing my enthusiasm, the masses became even more motivated. When they went to ask the Anchang Machine Factory to install them, the factory director and the workshop director personally took charge and installed the automatic iron stand swivel chairs overnight. In just over ten days, the "Red Children's Beauty Salon" was built up in a lively manner. If it weren't for the support of the Party and the communist spirit of cooperation of the workers, it would not have been so fast.

    As soon as the children walked in, they were all attracted by the various toys, happily playing with them. So, I smiled and asked, "Little friend, would you like to sit in the car or on the rocking horse?" The child replied, "I want to sit in the car." I affectionately picked him up and put him in the car-shaped chair, chatting with him while giving him a haircut. While the child was having fun and chatting enthusiastically, I had already finished cutting his hair. Because the hairdressers in our salon exchange experiences and improve quickly, they can all master the psychology and hairstyle preferences of boys and girls. Therefore, all the children who come to our salon regard getting a haircut as a happy thing.

    Whenever I think of the happy life of the children today, I recall my bitter childhood. I was born into a tenant farmer's family. My family had no land, and my parents worked for landlords and wealthy people. Later, because my father fell ill and his leg was lame, he could not work. When I was two years old, I went begging with my father. Later, my father starved to death, and I was fostered in someone else's home. I went to learn hairdressing at the age of twelve. I can't finish talking about the bitter days in three days and three nights. After liberation, I was truly a human being, and a person respected by everyone. I love the hairdressing profession, and my wife also joined the hairdressing work with my help. Now, both of us are in different hairdressing positions, engaged in the noble cause of beautifying life. We have done a little work, and the Party has given us great honor. The Party has educated us to continuously make revolution. I will listen to the Party's words, continuously work hard, study diligently, earnestly delve into things, master children's hairdressing skills, be a children's hairdresser for life, and serve our next generation, the successors of communism, for life.

### 我要做一辈子儿童理发师

    我要做一辈子儿童理发师
    重庆市七星岗人民公社“红孩子美容室”理发师  张治荣
    大概许多人都看见过，在反映重庆市大跃进的“春色满山城”这部影片里，有几个介绍七星岗人民公社“红孩子美容室”的镜头：在一间设有自动木马、坦克、汽车、兔子……的小理发座椅的美容室里，小顾客被各种玩具吸引住了。他们高高兴兴地玩着各种玩具，看小人书等着理发；有一个不过二十七八岁的青年理发师，正在为一个儿童舒服自在地理着头发，这就是我们的“红孩子美容室”和我的工作情形……。
    说起“红孩子美容室”的来历，不免有些罗嗦。那是今年春天2月初的一个晚上，我们听了党支部书记作了报告。报告讲的是商业工作者要进一步组织好人民经济生活，要求每个人多想法子，从各个方面改进工作，更好地为人民服务。我听了报告，当晚就睡在床上动脑筋：我在旧社会十二岁就学理发；现在二十八岁，整整干了十六年。这些年来，我觉得儿童的头发最难理了。儿童不愿进理发室，就是进来了，一坐上理发座，不是哭就是闹，活蹦乱跳地，非得大人撑着强迫理发，不小心还要割条血口，很难得有一个顺顺当当的。要是想出个什么法子，能让儿童们不哭不闹，乖乖地理头发，那才叫好呵！想到这里我们理发师和干各种职业的人一样，受到人们的尊重。思前想后，我的劲头就更大了，决心要办个专门为儿童们服务的理发室。
    晚上想好了，第二天我就跑去请示党支部，支部的同志都说：“好得很，是个改革，得马上搞起来。”并且把这任务也交给我负责来完成。我的想法是提出来了，到底怎么搞呢，心头没啥底。想了一阵，还是平常的工作启发了我：不久前我到机关托儿所去理发，看见儿童对那些木马呀，汽车呀，很感兴趣，爬上去就不愿意下来，儿童理发的椅子要能够做成玩具的形状，孩子们一定欢迎。于是我立刻就跑到托儿所去，看玩具是怎样做的。看了回来和群众研究，都说要得，别的理发师的情绪也很高，说干就干。有的说要请木工来做椅子。我说，这是搞革新，要讲节约，自己学着做，不行拆了重新来过。大家觉得我的话对，就动手干起来。我们三个人分头去请美工画图样，找木料，修理布置门面，自己当木匠，自己当泥工，样样都自己干。就这样白天晚上的搞，两天就把木马、汽车、兔子等各种模样的小椅子做出来了。哪知小座椅是木料制成的，既不能升降，也不会转动。大家一商量，得改进，就去向本地区的安昌机器厂工人请教，到郊区华龙桥去翻砂自动铁座磴。翻砂倒没有费多大的事，因为工人们都很支持我们；可是运回来，却不容易。我去拿座磴，没有想到十个磴子二百多斤重。那售票员说太重了，不让我搭车。我一想，自己扛。可是走几步就走不动了，我忽然想起采取走一段送一段的办法，一手提两个磴子往前走一段，搁着，又回来运剩下的。像这样一程转一程，从中午十二点钟运到晚上八点钟，终于从郊外的华龙桥把十个铁磴运了回来。群众见我这样的劲头，干劲也更大了。去请安昌机器厂安装时，厂里的厂长、车间主任亲自上阵，连夜安装自动铁磴小转椅。十几天光景，就热热闹闹地把“红孩子美容室”建立起来了。要不是党的支持和工人们的共产主义协作精神，决不会这么快当。
    孩子们一走进门来，个个都被各种玩具吸引住了，高高兴兴地玩着各种玩具，于是我就笑眯眯地问“小朋友，你喜欢坐汽车还是坐木马？”孩子回答说：“我要坐汽车。”我就亲热地把他抱上汽车形状的椅子，一边和他摆龙门阵，一边给他理发。孩子正玩得愉快，谈得起劲的时候，我已经把发理完毕了。由于我们理发室里的理发员互相交流经验，提高也很快，都能掌握男女小孩的心理和发式的爱好了。所以凡是来到我们美容室理发的孩子，都把理发当成一件快乐的事情。
    一想到孩子们今天的幸福生活，我就回忆起我苦难的童年时代。我出身是一个雇农的家庭，家里无田无地，父母亲都是为地主和有钱人劳动过活，后来因为父亲患病腿拐了，不能劳动，我两岁时就跟父亲一起要饭吃。后来父亲饿死了，我寄养在别人家，才十二岁就去学剃头。苦日子三天三夜讲不完。解放后，我才算真正做了一个人，而且是人人尊重的人。我热爱理发事业，我爱人也是在我的帮助下参加理发工作的。现在我们夫妻两个都是在不同的理发岗位上，从事美化生活的崇高事业。我们作了一点工作，党给我们很大的光荣。党教育我们要不断革命。我一定要听党的话，不断努力，认真学习，认真钻研，精通儿童理发技术，做一辈子儿童的理发师，为我们的下一代，为共产主义的接班人服务一生。
