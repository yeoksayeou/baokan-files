Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Chilean agricultural delegation led by the head of the delegation, Clodomiro Almeyda Medina, and the deputy heads, Gastón Cavallo Derien and Eduardo Rojas.

    Vice President Hu Yuzhi spoke first at the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, he expressed a warm welcome to the Chilean friends who have come to visit our country from afar. Hu Yuzhi said that although China and Chile are far apart, the people of both countries have had the common experience of being oppressed and exploited by imperialism. Therefore, in the anti-imperialist struggle and economic development, the people of China and Chile need to strengthen mutual support and mutual learning.

    Head of Delegation Almeyda expressed his heartfelt thanks to Vice President Hu Yuzhi for the warm hospitality in his speech. He warmly praised China's construction achievements. Almeyda emphasized that the common enemy of our two peoples is imperialism, and Chile is closer to the imperialist countries than China and suffers more oppression than China. China has rich experience in the anti-imperialist struggle, and we hope to learn from the Chinese people's experience in the anti-imperialist struggle through this visit, to learn from the experience of Chinese agricultural production, and to learn from the spirit of the Chinese people in dedicating everything to the construction of the motherland.

    Also present at the banquet were Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association and President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and others.

    据新华社2日讯　中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由团长克洛多米罗·阿耳梅达·梅迪纳和副团长卡斯东·卡瓦洛·德里恩、爱德华多·罗哈斯率领的智利农业代表团。
    胡愈之副会长首先在宴会上讲话。他代表中国人民外交学会对远道来我国访问的智利朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。胡愈之说，中国和智利两国虽然相距很远，但两国人民有过受帝国主义压迫、剥削的共同遭遇，因此在反帝斗争和发展经济方面，中国智利两国人民需要加强相互支持、相互学习。
    阿耳梅达团长在讲话中对胡愈之副会长盛情的招待表示衷心的感谢。他热情地赞扬中国建设的成就。阿耳梅达着重地说，我们两国人民共同的敌人是帝国主义，而智利距离帝国主义国家比中国更近，所受到的压迫比中国更厉害，中国有着丰富的反帝斗争的经验，我们希望通过这次访问学习中国人民反帝斗争的经验，学习中国农业生产的经验，学习中国人民如何把自己的一切贡献给祖国的建设事业的精神。
    出席宴会的还有中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长、中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南等。
