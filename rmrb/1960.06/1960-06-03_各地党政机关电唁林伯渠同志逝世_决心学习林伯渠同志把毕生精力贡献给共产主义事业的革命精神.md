Upon hearing the news of Comrade Lin Boqu's passing on May 29, I was overcome with grief.

He further contributed his life's energy to the cause of the new democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, leaving behind great achievements, and was therefore loved by the people of the whole country. As I am not in Beijing, I am unable to pay my respects to the remains, which I deeply regret and am filled with grief. I am sending this telegram of condolence.
