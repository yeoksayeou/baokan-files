Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: The 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) solemnly opened in Beijing this morning.

The meeting will focus on discussing the development of the international situation, the current activities and tasks of the trade union movement, and the issue of anti-colonialism struggles. The meeting expressed the common will of the WFTU's more than 100 million members, sternly condemning the aggression and war policies of imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, and calling on workers of all countries to remain vigilant at all times and intensify the struggle against imperialism.

This is the first time that the WFTU has held a council meeting in China. A total of 120 people attended the meeting, including chairmen, vice-chairmen, members of the Executive Committee, council members, alternate members, and specially invited representatives, from 58 countries and regions across five continents. These included representatives of trade unions from socialist countries, trade union representatives from countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America where anti-colonial struggles are widely unfolding, and trade union representatives from many capitalist countries in the West.

In the current situation, where the struggle of the world's working class and people against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace is unprecedentedly favorable, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people warmly welcome the convening of the council meeting. Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressed the Chinese workers' and people's expectations for the meeting in his welcoming speech at today's meeting. He wished the meeting great success and hoped that through this meeting, the world's working class would be encouraged to further strengthen unity and jointly fight against our common enemy – imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys.

The meeting was held in the solemn meeting hall of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China. Conspicuous slogans written in French and Chinese were displayed in the hall: "Workers of the world support brothers who are carrying out anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggles," "For the independence, unity and action of all nationalities," "For unity and action against monopoly capitalists and for trade union and democratic rights," "Proletarian internationalism and the united action of workers will cause new defeats for imperialism."

At 9:00 a.m., WFTU President Novella announced the opening of the 11th Council Meeting of the WFTU.

In his opening speech, he first thanked the Chinese workers and the Chinese trade unions for their warm and friendly hospitality and paid tribute to all the delegates and guests attending the meeting as observers. He announced that WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant was unable to attend the council meeting because he fell ill on his way to Beijing.

Novella said that the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference did not take place because of the cold war policy pursued by the imperialist forces headed by the United States. He said that the working class has been bravely fighting to defend peace for many years, and this struggle is combined with the peaceful policies pursued by socialist countries, the heroic struggles of people in colonial countries for independence, and the struggles of people in capitalist countries against the aggressive policies and exploitation of their governments. Their struggle has achieved many major victories, forcing imperialist forces to retreat. However, imperialism continues to pursue policies of war and aggression, engage in provocations, and infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries. In this situation, it is even more necessary for workers around the world to further strengthen their struggle for peace. He said that the forces of peace are invincible. He believes that striving for the relaxation of the international situation, disarmament, and peaceful competition are the goals of the current struggle. Defending peace is the central topic of this council meeting, and he is confident that the meeting will successfully complete this task.

In his welcoming speech, Li Jiebo said that this meeting is a meeting of great unity of the world's working class. We earnestly hope that this meeting will issue a resounding call, encouraging the working class of the world to further strengthen unity, oppose our common enemy – imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys, and jointly fight for the defense of the democratic rights and vital interests of the working class, for the liberation of all oppressed nations and oppressed people in the world, and for lasting world peace.

In his speech, Li Jiebo focused on exposing the two-faced tactics of U.S. imperialism: feigned relaxation but real war preparations, feigned peace but real aggression. He pointed out that facts have proven that Eisenhower is not a "peace envoy" at all, but a thorough representative of Wall Street's aggressive and war forces. He said that the essence of U.S. imperialism's aggression and plunder has not changed in the slightest. This situation must arouse the high vigilance of the world's working class and people, abandon illusions, and strengthen the struggle.

Li Jiebo emphasized that peace cannot be begged for. Only when the world's working class and the masses of people are mobilized to wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against the main and most ferocious enemy of peace, U.S. imperialism, constantly expose its war conspiracies, shatter its plans for aggression and war, and restrain its hands in launching aggression and war, can the goal of stopping war and defending peace be achieved.

The meeting then adopted the agenda. The agenda of this council meeting is: the development of the international situation and the current activities and tasks of the trade union movement; the contribution of trade unions to the anti-colonialism struggle; the report of the Finance Review Committee on the financial report.

Subsequently, Marcel Bras, Secretary of the WFTU Secretariat, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda on behalf of WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant. The report sternly condemned the aggressive and hypocritical policies of U.S. imperialism. When talking about the U.S. government's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, the report emphasized that "These heinous provocations by the U.S. imperialists are not only an arrogant and intolerable challenge to the working class and people of the Soviet Union, but also a serious damage to the cause of peace and the interests of workers in all countries."

The report said, "The WFTU condemns the aggressive and hypocritical policies of the U.S. militarist clique and Eisenhower and his government. Under the cover of sweet words, they are in fact pursuing a policy of strength and a 'brinkmanship' policy."

This report of the WFTU calls on workers around the world to "maintain vigilance at all times." The report emphasized that "Imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, has exposed its face as the enemy of peace and the people of all countries. It remains the source of war." If the forces of peace in the world always unite and act, they can defeat the war forces of imperialism.

The report pointed out that the upsurge in anti-colonial struggles in various countries is developing at "a speed that Western governments cannot catch up with," adding hundreds of millions of fresh troops to the great anti-imperialist alliance.

This report, which is as long as 40,000 words, discusses the current international situation and the tasks of the struggle for peace; elaborates on the economic situation of capitalist countries and the tragic situation of workers in capitalist countries; discusses the situation of workers in capitalist countries fighting against monopoly capital and puts forward a common program of economic and social demands; introduces the creative struggle of workers in socialist countries; and finally discusses strengthening the united action between workers and trade union organizations at all levels and the solidarity of the international working class.

Those seated on the rostrum at today's meeting were: WFTU President Novella (Italy), Vice-Presidents Grishin (Soviet Union), Benoît Frachon (France), Liu Changsheng (China), Vicente Lombardo Toledano (Mexico), Herbert Warnke (German Democratic Republic), Dange (India), František Zupka (Czechoslovakia), Loga-Sowiński (Poland), and Enrique Pastorino (Uruguay).

Also seated on the rostrum were Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Vice-Chairman Li Jiebo, who were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The morning session adjourned after the report on the first item on the agenda was completed. The meeting continued in the afternoon. (Attached picture)

    谴责以美国为首的帝国主义　加紧同帝国主义进行斗争
    世界工联理事会议在北京开幕
    诺维拉致开幕词　马赛尔·布拉代表世界工联总书记赛扬作第一项议程的报告
    李颉伯致欢迎辞，祝会议将鼓舞工人阶级加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争
    新华社5日讯　世界工会联合会第十一次理事会会议，今天上午在北京隆重开幕。
    这次会议将着重讨论国际局势的发展及工会运动当前的活动和任务，以及反殖民主义斗争的问题。会议表达了世界工会联合会一亿多会员的共同意志，严正地谴责以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，号召各国工人时刻保持警惕，加紧同帝国主义进行斗争。
    这是世界工联第一次在我国召开理事会会议。出席会议的有主席、副主席、执行委员会委员、理事会理事、候补理事、特邀代表共一百二十人，他们来自五大洲五十八个国家和地区。其中有社会主义国家工会的代表，有来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲广泛展开反殖民主义斗争的国家和地区的工会代表，以及西方许多资本主义国家工会的代表。
    在当前全世界工人阶级和世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争空前有利的形势下，中国工人阶级和中国人民热烈欢迎理事会会议的召开。中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯在今天会议上致欢迎辞时，热切地表达了中国工人和人民对会议的期望，他预祝这次会议取得巨大的成功，期望通过这次会议，鼓舞全世界工人阶级进一步加强团结，为反对我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗而共同奋斗。
    会议在庄严的中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议厅举行。在会场上有法、中两种文字书写的醒目标语：“全世界工人支援正在进行反殖民主义和反帝国主义斗争的兄弟们”，“为各族人民的独立团结和行动起来”，“为反对垄断资本家、争取工会和民主权利团结和行动起来”，“无产阶级的国际主义和工人们的行动统一将使帝国主义遭受新的失败”。
    上午九时，世界工联主席诺维拉宣布世界工联第十一次理事会会议开幕。
    他在开幕词中，首先对中国工人、中国工会的热烈友好的招待表示感谢，向所有代表和以观察员身份参加会议的来宾们致敬。他宣布世界工联总书记路易·赛扬因在来北京途中生病，不能参加这次理事会会议。
    诺维拉说，巴黎四国首脑会议没有开成，是因为以美国为首的帝国主义势力执行冷战政策的缘故。他说，工人阶级多年来英勇地进行了保卫和平的斗争，这个斗争，同社会主义国家执行的和平政策、殖民地国家人民争取独立的英雄斗争和资本主义国家人民反对他们的政府的侵略政策和剥削的斗争汇合在一起。他们的斗争已经取得许多重大的胜利，迫使帝国主义势力不得不后退。然而，帝国主义仍在继续执行战争和侵略的政策，进行挑衅，侵犯别国的主权。在这种情况下，全世界工人进一步加强他们争取和平的斗争就更为必要。他说，和平力量是不可战胜的。他认为，争取国际局势的缓和、裁军和和平竞赛，是当前斗争的目标。保卫和平是这次理事会会议的中心议题，深信会议一定会很好地完成这个任务。
    李颉伯在致欢迎辞时说，这次会议是一次世界工人阶级大团结的会议。我们热切地期望，这次会议将发出响亮的号召，鼓舞全世界工人阶级进一步加强团结，反对我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗，为保卫工人阶级民主权利和切身利益，为争取全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放，为争取世界的持久和平而共同奋斗。
    李颉伯在讲话中着重揭露了美帝国主义假和缓、真备战，假和平、真侵略的两面手法。他指出，事实证明，艾森豪威尔并不是什么“和平使者”，而是道道地地的华尔街侵略和战争势力的头号代表。他说，美帝国主义的侵略和掠夺本质丝毫没有改变。正是这种情况，必须引起全世界工人阶级和人民的高度警惕，丢掉幻想，加强斗争。
    李颉伯强调，和平不能乞求。只有世界工人阶级和人民群众动员起来，向和平的主要的、最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义进行坚决的、不屈不挠的斗争，不断揭露它的战争阴谋，打破它的侵略和战争计划，束缚住它发动侵略和战争的手脚，才能够达到制止战争、保卫和平的目的。
    会议随后通过了议程。这次理事会议的议程是：国际局势的发展以及工会运动当前的活动和任务；工会对反殖民主义斗争的贡献；财务审查委员会关于财务报告。
    接着，世界工联书记处书记马赛尔·布拉代表世界工联总书记路易·赛扬就会议的第一项议程作了报告。这个报告严正谴责了美帝国主义的侵略和伪善政策。报告在谈到美国政府破坏四国首脑会议时着重指出，“美帝国主义者的这些罪恶挑衅行为不仅是对苏联工人阶级和人民一次狂妄的和不可容忍的挑战，而且也是对和平事业和各国工人利益的严重损害。”
    报告说，“世界工联谴责美国军国主义集团和艾森豪威尔及其政府的侵略和伪善的政策。他们在花言巧语的掩盖之下事实上奉行着实力政策和‘边缘’政策。”
    世界工联的这个报告号召全世界的工人“必须时刻保持警惕”，报告强调说，“以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义暴露了它是和平和各国人民的敌人的面目。它依然是战争的根源。”如果世界的和平力量始终团结起来行动，它们能够击败帝国主义的战争势力。
    报告中指出：各国反殖民主义斗争的高涨，正以“一种西方政府喘息不及的速度”发展着，为伟大的反帝联盟增加了亿万生力军。
    这个报告长达四万字，它谈到了当前国际形势和争取和平的斗争任务；阐述了资本主义国家的经济状况和资本主义国家工人的悲惨处境；谈到了资本主义国家工人同垄断资本进行斗争的情况，并提出经济社会方面的共同要求纲领；报告还介绍了社会主义国家工人的创造性斗争情况；最后谈到加强工人和各级工会组织之间的统一行动以及国际工人阶级的团结等问题。
    今天会上在主席台就座的有，世界工联主席诺维拉（意大利）、副主席格里申（苏联）、贝诺瓦·弗拉商（法国）、刘长胜（中国）、维森特·隆巴多·托列达诺（墨西哥）、赫伯特·瓦恩克（德意志民主共和国）、丹吉（印度）、弗朗齐歇克·苏普卡（捷克斯洛伐克）、洛加—索文斯基（波兰）、恩里克·帕斯塔里诺（乌拉圭）。
    在主席台上就座的，还有应邀参加开幕式的中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，副主席李颉伯。
