Xinhua News Agency, 10th June. Congolese political party delegation leader Henri Kassongo's speech at the welcome rally held by people from all walks of life in the capital is as follows in full: Dearest comrades,

	I am honored to express, through you, to the Chinese people, on behalf of our delegation and myself, our gratitude for your warm hospitality and friendly reception.

	I have nothing new to tell you. Having a common origin and the same destiny, the struggle against a common enemy and a shared future naturally bring the people of our two countries closer together.

	The Congolese people have always highly valued and expressed sincere gratitude for the continuous spiritual support that the Chinese people have given to the Congolese people's struggle for independence.

	We firmly believe that this initial meeting has established a link between the Chinese and Congolese people and will become a bridge for more effective, closer, and more substantial relations in the future.

	In addition to forming the aforementioned bridge, the purpose of our visit to China is to understand the political, economic, and social progress that the Chinese people have made since liberation, and, more importantly, to understand the methods adopted to achieve this result, so that we can avoid mistakes from the very beginning.

	We express our admiration for the achievements made by the Chinese people since liberation. We hope that this meeting and trip, which aim to learn and understand, will bring the results we expect. Long live international socialism!

	Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live independent Congo! Long live Sino-Congolese friendship!

    对于共同敌人的斗争  使中刚人民接近起来
    新华社10日讯　刚果政党代表团领导人亨利·卡松戈在首都各界欢迎大会上的讲话，全文如下：最亲爱的同志们：
    我很荣幸地以我们代表团和我个人的名义通过你们向中国人民表达我们感激的心情，感谢你们的热情好客和友好接待。
    我没有什么新的东西可以告诉你们，有着共同渊源的同样命运，对共同敌人的斗争和共同的前途很自然地使我们两国人民接近起来。
    对于中国人民在刚果人民争取独立的斗争中所不断给予的精神上的支援，刚果人民始终给予很高的评价，并且表示衷心的感谢。
    我们深信，这次初次会见沟通了中刚两国人民的联系，并且成为未来更有成效、更加紧密和更物质化的关系的桥梁。
    我们此次来华访问除了构成上述的桥梁而外，其目的还在于了解中国人民从解放以来在政治、经济和社会方面所取得的进展，尤其重要的是了解为了达到这一成果而采用的方法，使我们在一开始就能避免错误。
    我们对中国人民自解放以来所取得的成就表示钦佩。希望目的在于学习和了解的这次会见和旅行能带来我们所预期的结果。国际社会主义万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！独立的刚果万岁！中刚友谊万岁！
