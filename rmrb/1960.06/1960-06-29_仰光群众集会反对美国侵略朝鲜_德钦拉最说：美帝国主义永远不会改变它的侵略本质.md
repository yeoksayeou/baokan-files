Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 26th. The Burmese Trade Union Congress held a mass rally here today, resolutely opposing US aggression against Korea and supporting the Korean people's just struggle for the reunification of their fatherland.

	Thakin Lwin, Acting Chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, strongly condemned the aggressive policy of US imperialism and praised the heroic fighting spirit of the Korean people at the meeting.

	Thakin Lwin said that the victory of the Korean people is of great significance. This is not only a victory for the Korean people struggling against the US aggressors, but also a victory for the people all over the world fighting for peace. This victory has taught US imperialism a lesson and encouraged peace-loving and oppressed people all over the world to fight imperialism to the end.

	Thakin Lwin emphasized that US imperialism is the common enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. US imperialism will never change its aggressive nature. We must not have any illusions about it. Only by resolutely fighting against US imperialism can we win victory.

	Thakin Lwin said that since the end of World War II, US imperialism has consistently supported reactionaries in various places, prepared for war, and threatened world peace. He called on peace-loving people of all countries to resolutely fight against US imperialism to prevent the outbreak of another world war.

	Achmad Diah, Minister of the International Department of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, who is visiting Burma, said at the meeting that the victory of the South Korean people's struggle against US imperialism proves that US imperialism is a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite and fight against US imperialism, they can defeat the US imperialist warmongers and thwart their conspiracies.

	Achmad Diah said that the forces defending peace are stronger than ever. After the failure of the "policy of strength," US imperialism is preparing for war by resorting to the conspiracy of false peace. He said that we must be vigilant and not be deceived by US imperialism.

	The conference passed a resolution strongly condemning the US aggression and supporting the Korean people's struggle. The resolution said that US imperialism is carrying out unscrupulous activities and vicious conspiracies to continue to support a new puppet regime in South Korea in order to suppress the Korean people, continue to maintain military bases in South Korea, and divide Korea. This action by US imperialism not only threatens peace in Korea, but also threatens peace in Asia and the world.

    仰光群众集会反对美国侵略朝鲜
    德钦拉最说：美帝国主义永远不会改变它的侵略本质
    新华社仰光26日电　缅甸工会大会今天在这里举行群众大会，坚决反对美国侵略朝鲜，支持朝鲜人民争取重新统一祖国的正义斗争。
    缅甸工会大会代理主席德钦拉最在会上强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略政策，赞扬朝鲜人民的英勇斗争精神。
    德钦拉最说，朝鲜人民的胜利具有伟大的意义。这不仅是对美国侵略者斗争的朝鲜人民的胜利，也是为和平事业而斗争的全世界人民的胜利。这一胜利给了美帝国主义一次教训，并且鼓舞世界上爱好和平的和受压迫的人民同帝国主义斗争到底。
    德钦拉最强调指出，美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义永远不会改变它的侵略本质。我们决不能对它抱任何幻想。只有同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，我们才能赢得胜利。
    德钦拉最说，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义一贯扶植各地的反动分子，准备战争，威胁世界和平。他呼吁爱好和平的世界各国人民同美帝国主义坚决进行斗争，以防止另一次世界大战的爆发。
    正在缅甸访问的全印度尼西亚中央职工会国际部部长阿哈迪亚特在大会上说，南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的胜利证明了美帝国主义是纸老虎，它外强中干。只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致同美帝国主义作斗争，就能击败美帝国主义战争贩子，挫败他们的阴谋。
    阿哈迪亚特说，保卫和平的力量比以往任何时候更加强大。在“实力政策”破产之后，美帝国主义正在借助于搞假和平的阴谋来准备战争。他说，我们必须提高警惕，不要受美帝国主义的欺骗。
    大会通过了一项决议，强烈谴责美国的侵略罪行，并支持朝鲜人民的斗争。决议说，美帝国主义正在进行不择手段的活动和恶毒的阴谋来继续的在南朝鲜扶植新的傀儡政权，以便镇压朝鲜人民，继续保持在南朝鲜的军事基地，分裂朝鲜。美帝国主义的这种行动不仅威胁朝鲜的和平，而且威胁亚洲和世界和平。
