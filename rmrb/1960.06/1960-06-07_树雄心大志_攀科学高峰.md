As representatives of the Feed Production Teaching and Research Group of Gansu Agricultural University, we have greatly improved the quality of teaching because we take politics as the soul of all our work, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, and closely integrate teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. Eighty percent of our students have achieved excellent results, and we have basically completed the training tasks for undergraduate and graduate students. At the same time, we have held multiple grassland workshops and training classes for other regions, training more than two hundred grassland workers at all levels. In recent years, we have delved into production practice and made some achievements in the theoretical research of grassland science. At the beginning of this year, we compiled and published a high-quality grassland science textbook, revised the university reference books "Grassland Survey" and "Pasture Science" (800,000 words), and also wrote seven popular books on grasslands, feeding, and other related topics.

    Implementing On-Site Teaching

In recent years, under the leadership of the school Party committee, and through continuous summarization and improvement, we have deeply realized that to seriously implement the "three combinations" (teaching, productive labor, and scientific research) and achieve a triple harvest, going deep into reality and conducting on-site teaching is an important method. We had struggles on this issue, but under the leadership of the Party, we were victorious.

When we started to implement on-site teaching, some people said, "The production site has great limitations, and it is impossible to learn systematic theory well." Some also pessimistically envisioned "teaching whatever is available at the site," meaning that there should be no systematic theoretical teaching. These views were obviously wrong. We tried every means to make careful arrangements to closely integrate the teaching content with the on-site conditions. For example, in 1959, when teaching the chapter on grassland types on the Tianzhu grassland, we found that the Songxiaotan on-site teaching location was different from any confirmed type. We then used the basic theory of types to explore the local grassland type. Through repeated research, we not only understood all aspects of the type theory but also discovered a completely new grassland type: alpine-arid grassland. For example, while discussing grassland improvement, we proposed how to improve grasslands like Songshantan. After joint discussion by teachers and students, a comprehensive measure plan for improving the local grassland was proposed, which resulted in a threefold increase in forage yield. The students said, "We have enlivened the theory, and we have a better understanding when doing grassland work." This powerfully refuted the saying that "on-site teaching has great limitations and it is impossible to learn systematic theory well."

In order to fully utilize the advantages of on-site production teaching, we also paid attention to closely integrating the teaching content with the production season. According to the teaching syllabus, "the establishment of artificial feed bases" was originally to be taught at the end of the semester, but at the production site, various production labors had to be carried out at the beginning of the growing season. Therefore, we moved this part forward. Through practice, the students gained practical knowledge and promoted production. For example, when students grazed sheep, they conducted observations in groups after careful arrangements, and finally clarified the feeding habits of sheep at the end of spring weakness, and discovered the "critical time" of sheep, and a series of other important issues; for example, when helping the ranch to delineate rotational grazing areas, they found that the general plan had a lot of waste, and after research, they proposed a new plan that could save 50% of the grassland area.

In addition, we organized student experiments, fully integrated the experimental design with the production site, strictly demanded, and completed the production tasks and research tasks through experiments. For example, pasture seed identification was combined with the sowing of the pasture experimental area, and haymaking was combined with production. The students said, "Grassland science experiments are not just empty talk; they are very interesting." We also organized student topic groups, with teacher guidance, to contract specific topics to study the topics found at the production site. For example, the affirmation of the new type of alpine-arid grassland was the result of collaborative research by eighteen topic groups. And on-site teaching provided very favorable conditions for the topic selection and research of graduation theses. For example, the research on "the removal of poisonous and harmful plants on grasslands" is a topic of important theoretical and production significance in protecting and improving grasslands, and only by going to the production site can we deeply explore true theories and specific measures under various conditions. And these graduation theses are all part of the teaching and research group's entire research plan.

Through the above methods, the three combinations centered on teaching in the field teaching of grassland science have been vigorously carried out. Teachers often stay up late to grade students' homework and review research plans and research reports, and students do not avoid wind and snow, are not afraid of hardship, and are full of enthusiasm, naturally forming a mass movement to improve teaching quality and engage in large-scale scientific research.

The Struggle Between Two Roads, Thoroughly Breaking the "Saturation Theory"

After liberation, our feed production research group took on the teaching task of grassland science. At that time, none of us had studied grassland science, and there was no ready-made textbook, and reference materials were also lacking. What to do? Should we find a foreign book and read it verbatim? Or should we take a foreign book and change its appearance to muddle through? The Party instructed us: The course must be opened, and it must be taught well, and we must establish our own grassland science in China.

At the beginning of the work, we encountered a fierce struggle. The reactionary theory of the American grassland scientist Shantz, who, after examining several pastoral areas in Northwest China in 1943, concluded that "livestock in Northwest China has reached saturation," was deeply believed and widely disseminated by the vast majority of animal husbandry workers in our country, and even doubted the policy of high-speed development of animal husbandry. Therefore, in dealing with the development of animal husbandry, some people advocated that "to raise livestock well, we should first kill a batch"; others advocated "limiting the lambing rate." These various fallacies are essentially a replica of Malthus's population theory in animal husbandry, directly endangering our country's socialist construction. In order to refute this deeply rooted reactionary viewpoint, we organized ourselves under the correct leadership of the Party and spent several years surveying the grasslands of Gansu and Qinghai provinces. The survey results proved that our pastoral areas do not lack feed, but have great potential. For example, as long as the existing pastures in Huangchengtan, Damaying, and Sanjiaocheng are fully and rationally utilized, the number of livestock can be immediately increased by more than 100%. If the utilization and management system of the grasslands is appropriately improved, the carrying capacity will be even more considerable. We used ironclad evidence to combat the "saturation theory."

We won the first step. However, as a Chinese grassland academic theory, two difficulties must be solved: ① Some grasslands were indeed damaged or began to deteriorate due to the Kuomintang's reactionary rule before liberation, resulting in overgrazing; ② There is still the problem of spring weakness. Almost every spring, due to insufficient feed, seasonal weakness occurs in different regions, and even large numbers die. In order to adapt to the high-speed development of animal husbandry in our country and to establish a complete new theory of grassland science in our country, we followed the principle of "practice-theory-practice." While consulting a large number of documents at home and abroad, we almost traveled all the pastoral areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and some agricultural areas of Gansu Province. Finally, we discovered that different grasslands have different essences, and based on this research and analysis, we divided our country's grasslands into seven basic categories: alpine, sub-alpine grassland, forest grassland, humid grassland, arid grassland, semi-desert grassland, desert grassland, alpine arid grassland. We got rid of the long-used one-sided, chaotic standard classification schemes (such as wetland grassland, high grass area, low grass area, floodplain area, etc.), and relatively completely and systematically explained the laws of occurrence and development of grassland in our country, especially in Northwest China.

However, when we wrote this theory into a paper and published it, we angered some people who regarded themselves as authorities. They played with some so-called authoritative scholars' works from foreign countries, saying that we violated this and messed up that, and in short, they could not agree. At that time, the Party strongly supported us, and we were even more confident. We reviewed it again and decided to persevere. We decided to find ways to increase production through further research on types, so that the new grassland science would have muscles when it had a framework.

    Improving Grassland Productivity

In the case of insufficient manpower and difficult conditions, we established China's first grassland positioning research base – Tianzhu Alpine Grassland Research Station – in the valley at the junction of Mashao Ridge and Qilian Mountain. We built a canvas tent there and, according to the type system, placed various instruments on the large and small hills around the research station to explore the various secrets of the alpine grassland and overcome the key to high yield. Here, we also encountered tests. At the beginning of the work, some people disagreed with setting up the research station in such a "bitter" place, with wolves and bears, and "too far" from the residential area, and even predicted that we would not persist. There was also one person among us who couldn't stand the "bitterness," cried, didn't eat, didn't get out of bed, and ran away halfway. But we firmly believed that as long as we had the support of the Party, our tent would not collapse. In the most difficult time, the Party supported us, and two graduate students came here to write their graduation theses. Their original topics were not on the grassland, but the Party saw that this was a promising seed and gave us support in the difficulties. With basic strength, the work began. We rushed around the vast grassland day and night. Sometimes, in order to seize the season and time, we had to fight day and night. When we were extremely sleepy, we walked and slept. We fell and woke up, got up and walked again. The climate on the alpine grassland is very cold, and it snows and freezes even in June and July. But no matter how strong the wind and snow, whether it was day or night, we accurately patrolled the various instrument installation points like a clock, observing and recording. Fearing that the distilled water bottles would freeze and crack, the comrades put them in their quilts. In this way, we finally achieved significant research results and finally found the characteristics of each type of alpine grassland and its succession law. Based on these research results, technical measures for improving the productivity of alpine grasslands were formulated. As a result, using the very simple method of breaking the turf, it was proven by the 1959 test that the grass yield of alpine grasslands could be increased by five times, and the vegetation composition was greatly changed. The excellent gramineous forage grasses increased from the original 3.95% to 66.09%, the weeds decreased from 59.33% to 29.76%, and the poisonous grasses decreased from 22% to 0.75%, already transitioning from dicotyledonous type to gramineous type. This achievement has been widely promoted in relevant areas of our country.

This research result also confirmed the theory that different types of grasslands can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. This provides a fundamental change to the theory of grassland improvement, breaking the boundary between symptomatic improvement and fundamental improvement. It pointed out the correct direction for us: ① Grasslands can undergo quantitative and qualitative changes rapidly and continuously; ② According to the law of movement of things, as long as the main contradiction of grassland succession is controlled and developed in a direction conducive to production, the productivity of grasslands can be continuously improved for a long time, instead of having to improve it in the short term and then deteriorate for a long time. This reversed the mood of not looking at the favorable factors, not finding the real cause of grassland deterioration, and being helpless, pessimistic, and disappointed in the face of difficulties, and gave a fatal blow to the "saturationists."

While vigorously carrying out the improvement of pasture yield, we also systematically studied the issue of rational utilization of grasslands. We carried out systematic grazing experiments on various types of alpine grasslands, determined the appropriate grazing degree for each type, and combined with other fixed research data, we formulated a complete set of design plans for rotational grazing in various types of alpine grasslands. This plan was cooperated with the Animal Husbandry Department and the Animal Husbandry Research Institute and partially applied to the Yongniu Commune in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, which has achieved good results. It has increased the grass yield of the grasslands by 19%, expanded the grassland area by 15%, improved the nutritional status of livestock, increased the number of livestock in full fat condition from 41% in the past to 84%, reduced the number of livestock in third-class fat condition from 17% in the past to 2.5%, and improved the livestock breeding rate, survival rate, and production performance. In 1959, when livestock in nearby pastures suffered from severe spring weakness and died in large numbers, this area effectively controlled the phenomenon of spring weakness. Not only did no livestock die due to weakness, but it also accommodated a large number of livestock from nearby areas. Currently, its experience is being promoted throughout the province.

Up to now, we can say that the "saturation theory" has been completely shattered both theoretically and in production practice. A new Chinese grassland science suitable for the high-speed development of animal husbandry has been initially established.

We have achieved a little success, which is first and foremost due to the Party. This is the victory of the Party's leadership and the victory of the Party's education policy. We express that we will never stop moving forward and continue to move forward with the spirit of continuous revolution. Now we are vigorously and gradually carrying out systematic research work on various grassland types, especially the grassland research work in desert areas where feed problems are very serious. We are planning rotational grazing for Tianzhu sheep farms, cattle farms, and several people's communes; at the same time, we are conducting dozens of research projects in seven strongholds including Gannan and Pingcheng. According to the example of the alpine grassland, which has already achieved a five-fold increase in pasture yield, we have put forward a new fighting slogan for ourselves: "Double the livestock, increase the feed five times," and ensure that we will complete the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program three years ahead of schedule, and vow to be pioneers in socialist construction and climb the peak of science.

    树雄心大志　攀科学高峰
    甘肃省农业大学饲料生产教研组代表　任继周
    我们甘肃农业大学饲料生产教研组，由于把政治作为各项工作的灵魂，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，并以教学为主，把教学、生产劳动和科学研究紧密结合起来，因而大大提高了教学质量。80％的学生都达到了优良成绩，基本上完成了本科学生和研究生的培养任务。同时，为外地多次举办了草原讲习会，草原训练班，培养了二百多名各级草原工作人员。几年来，我们深入生产实际，在草原学的理论研究工作中也作出了一些成绩，今年年初，我们编著并出版了质量较高的草原学教科书，修订了“草原调查”和八十万字的“牧草学”等大学参考用书，此外，还编写了七本有关草原、饲养等方面的通俗读物。
    实行现场教学
    几年来，在校党委的领导下，经过不断总结、提高，我们深深体会到，要认真做好“三结合”，实现教学、生产劳动和科学研究三丰收，深入实际、进行现场教学是个重要方法。在这个问题上，我们有过斗争，但是在党的领导下我们胜利了。
    在我们开始试行现场教学的时候，就有人说：“生产现场局限性大，不可能学好系统理论。”也有人消极地设想“到现场去有什么教什么”，意思是不要系统地理论教学了，这些观点显然是错误的。我们千方百计，细致安排，把教学内容与现场条件紧密地结合了起来。如1959年在天祝草原上讲到草原类型一章时，发现松小滩现场教学地点与已经肯定的任何类型都不一样，我们就运用关于类型的基本理论来探讨当地的草原类型，通过反复研究，不但弄通了关于类型理论的各个方面，而且发现了一个全新的草原类型：高山——干旱草原。又如在讲草原改良的同时，就提出松山滩这样的草原，应该如何改良。经过师生共同讨论，提出了改良当地草原的综合措施方案，结果使牧草产量提高了三倍。同学们说：“把理论学活了，再搞草原工作心里有了底。”这就有力地反驳了“现场教学局限性大，不可能学好系统理论”的说法。
    为了充分发挥生产现场教学的优越性，我们还注意了把教学内容与生产季节紧密结合起来。根据教学大纲，“人工饲料基地的建立”本来要在学期末讲授，但在生产现场要在生长季节开始时就进行各项生产劳动。于是我们就把这一部分调到前边来讲。通过实践，学生获得了实际知识，促进了生产。如学生在放牧羊群时，经过细致安排，分组进行观测，最后搞清了春乏末期羊群的采食规律，发现了羊只的“临界时间”，及其他一系列的重要问题；又如在帮助牧场划区轮牧时，发现通用方案有大量浪费现象，经过研究，提出了新方案，可节约草原面积50％。
    另外，我们组织了学生的实验课，把实验设计充分与生产现场结合起来，严格要求，通过实验完成了生产任务，也完成了研究任务。如牧草种子鉴定，结合牧草试验区的播种进行，干草调制，结合生产进行。同学们说：“草原学试验不是纸上谈兵，很有味道。”我们还组织了学生的专题小组，教师指导，分题包干，研究生产现场所发现的课题，如高山干旱草原这一新类型的肯定，就是通过十八个专题小组，分工协作的研究成果。而现场教学，又给毕业论文的命题和研究提供了十分有利的条件，譬如“草原有毒、有害植物的清除”研究，是个保护、改良草原方面有重要理论意义及生产意义的题目，只有到生产现场，才能在各种条件下，深入探讨真理论和具体措施。而这些毕业论文，都是教研组整个研究计划的一部分。
    通过上述方式，在草原学的现场教学中，以教学为中心的三结合，轰轰烈烈开展起来了。教师常常深夜为学生批改作业，审查研究计划和研究报告，学生更是不避风雪，不怕辛苦，热情洋溢，自然而然地形成了一个提高教学质量、大搞科学研究的群众运动。两条道路的斗争，大破“饱和论”
    解放以后，我们饲料生产研究组担任了草原学教学任务，当时我们谁都没有学过草原学，也没有一本现成的教科书，参考资料也很缺乏。怎么办呢？找一本外国书照本宣读呢？还是把外国书拿来改头换面敷衍了事呢？党指示我们：课，一定要开，也一定要教好，并且要建立我国自己的草原学。
    工作一开始，就遇到了一场激烈的斗争。美国草原学家蒋森，1943年考查我国西北若干牧区后，所得出的“中国西北牧区家畜已达饱和点”的反动理论，曾为我国广大畜牧工作者所深信不疑，而且广为传播，甚至怀疑高速度发展畜牧业的方针。因此在对待畜牧业发展问题上，有人主张“要把家畜养好，首先应该先杀掉一批”；有的人主张“限制产羔率”。这些形形色色的谬论，实质上都是马尔萨斯人口论在畜牧业上的翻版，直接危害着我国社会主义建设事业。为了驳倒这个根深蒂固的反动论点，我们在党的正确领导下组织起来，花了几年时间，在甘肃、青海两省的草原调查，调查结果证明，我国牧区不是饲料不足，而是有巨大潜力。如皇城滩、大马营、三角城等草原只要把现有牧草充分合理利用，就可立即增加百分之百以上的家畜，如果适当改善草原的利用和管理制度，其载畜量将更为可观。用铁的证据，打击了“饱和论”。
    第一步，我们胜利了。但是，作为中国的草原学术论，面前摆着两个难题必须解决：①当时确实有些草原由于解放前国民党反动统治，形成放牧过重，已经变坏或开始变坏；②目前仍有春乏问题。几乎每年春季，由于饲料不足，在不同的地区都要形成季节性乏弱现象，甚至大批死亡。为了适应我国畜牧业高速度的发展，为了建立起我国完整的草原学新理论，我们遵循着“实践——理论——实践”的原则，在查阅国内外大量文献的同时，几乎跑遍了甘肃省的各个牧区、半农半牧区以及一部分农业区。终于发现了不同的草原上有它不同的实质，并据此研究分析，把我国草原分成高山、亚高山草原、森林草原、湿润草原、干旱草原、半荒漠草原、荒漠草原、高山干旱草原等七个基本大类。摆脱了沿用已久的片面、杂乱的标准分类方案（如湿地草原、高草区、低草区、洪丛区等），比较完满而系统地说明了我国草原，尤其是西北草原发生与发展的规律。
    但是，当我们把这一理论写成论文发表时，又触怒了一些以权威自居的人物，他们搬弄着外国一些所谓权威学者的论著，说我们违反了这，搞乱了那，总之是不能同意。当时，党大力支持我们，我们信心更足，又重新作了审查，决定坚持下去。决定通过类型的进一步研究，找出提高生产的途径，使新的草原学在有了骨架的时候，肌肉也丰满起来了。
    提高草原生产力
    我们在人力不足、条件困难的情况下，在马哨岭和祁连山交界的山谷里，设立了我国第一个草原定位研究据点——天祝高山草原研究站。我们在那里搭了一顶帆布帐篷，并根据类型的体系，在研究站周围十来里的大小山岗上，安置了各式各样的仪器，探索高山草原的各项秘密，攻破丰产关键。在这里，我们也遇到了考验，工作刚开始就有人不同意把研究站设在这样“苦”的地方，有狼、有狗熊，离居民点“太远”，甚至预言我们不会坚持下去。我们中间也曾有过一个人，受不了“苦”，哭哭啼啼，不吃饭，不起床，中途跑掉了。但是我们坚信，只要有党的支持，我们这顶帐篷一定不会垮下去。在最困难的时候，党支持了我们，两位研究生到这里来作毕业论文了。他们本来的选题不在草原上，但党看出这是一个有希望的萌芽，在困难中，给了我们支援。有了基本力量，工作就开展起来。我们昼夜在广阔的草原上奔忙着，有时为了抢季节、抓时间，要日夜苦战，困极了，边走边睡，跌跤摔醒了，爬起来又走。高山草原上气候很冷，就是六、七月间也会下雪、结冰。但是无论风雪多大，不论是白天还是夜里，我们像时钟一样准确地巡防各个仪器装设点，观测记录。怕冻裂了蒸馏水瓶子，同志们就把它放在自己的被窝里。这样，我们终于取得了重大的研究成果，最后找到了高山草原各型特点及其演替规律。根据这些研究成果，制定了提高高山草原生产力的技术措施。结果，用很简便的划破草皮的方法，经过1959年试验证明，可以提高高山草原产草量达五倍，并在植被成分上大为改观，优良禾本科牧草由原来的3．95％增加到66．09％，杂草类由59．33％减少到29．76％，毒草由22％减少到0．75％，已经从双子叶型过渡到禾本科型。这项成果，已经在我国有关地区普遍推广。
    这一研究成果，还印证了不同类型草原在一定条件下可以互相转化的理论。这就给草原改良的理论提供了根本性的变革，打破了治标改良和治本改良的分界限。为我们指出了正确的方向：①草原可以不间断地、迅速地发生量和质的变化；②根据事物运动的规律，只要控制草原演替的主要矛盾的主要方面，使其向生产有利的方向发展，就可以长期不断提高草原生产力，而不是一定要短期内改良，然后长期变坏。从而扭转了那种不看有利因素，也找不出草原变坏的真正原因和在困难面前束手无策、悲观失望的情绪，给“饱和论”者以致命的打击。
    在大力进行提高牧草产量的同时，也系统进行了草原合理利用问题的研究，对于各型高山草原，作了系统的放牧试验，确定了各型适宜的放牧程度，结合其他定住研究资料，制定了高山草原各型划区轮牧的一整套设计方案，这一方案与畜牧厅和牧研所合作，部分地运用于天祝藏族自治县永牛公社，已经收到良好效果，提高了草原产草量19％，草原面积扩大了15％，改善了家畜营养状况，满膘家畜由过去的41％提高到84％，三等膘家畜由过去的17％下降到2．5％，提高了家畜繁殖率、成活率和生产性能。1959年，附近牧场上家畜春乏严重、大批死亡的时候，这块地区都有效地控制了春乏现象，不仅没有一只牲畜乏弱致死，还收容了附近地区的大量家畜。目前它的经验正在全省范围推广。
    到目前为止，我们可以说，“饱和论”无论从理论上，还是从生产实践上，已经被彻底粉碎了。适应于畜牧业高速度发展的新的中国的草原学，已经初步建立起来。
    我们取得了一点成绩，这首先应归功于党。这是党领导的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利。我们表示决不停止步伐，以不断革命精神继续前进。现在我们正在大力、逐步开展在各个草原类型上的系统研究工作，特别是饲料问题十分严重的沙漠地区的草原研究工作。我们正在为天祝羊场、牛场及几个人民公社规划划区轮牧；同时在甘南、坪城等七个据点进行几十项研究课题。根据高山草原所已经取得提高牧草产量达五倍的实例，我们给自己提出新的战斗口号是：“家畜增一倍，饲料增五倍”，保证提前三年完成农业发展纲要所规定的指标，誓作社会主义建设的尖兵，攀登科学高峰。
