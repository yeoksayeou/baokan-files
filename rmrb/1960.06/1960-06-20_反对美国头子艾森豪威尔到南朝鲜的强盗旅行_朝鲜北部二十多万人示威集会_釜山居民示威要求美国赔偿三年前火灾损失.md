    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th - According to local newspaper reports: In the cities of Kaesong, Haeju, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Sinuiju in northern Korea, a total of more than 200,000 people held rallies on the 17th and 18th to oppose Eisenhower's robber trip to South Korea.
    In Kaesong, near the Military Demarcation Line, a rally of 50,000 people was held on the 17th. Woman representative Sun Yeon-gyeong said in her speech that Eisenhower is the head of the American imperialist murderers. He slaughtered countless mothers' children and countless children's mothers in Korea. Because of his policy of dividing Korea, our beloved parents, brothers, relatives, and friends are separated by a military demarcation line and cannot see each other, and cannot even exchange letters. We will never allow this robber chieftain to set foot on our motherland.
    In Hamhung City, a rally of 60,000 people was held on the 18th. Kim Tae-ryong, Chairman of the Hamhung City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, pointed out in his speech that today's Asia is not an Asia where American imperialism can run rampant, and today's Korean people are not the Korean people of the past who endured abuse and oppression. He shouted: Eisenhower, get back home immediately!
    In Sinuiju City, a rally of 50,000 people was held on the 18th. Worker representative Lee Jong-hak said at the meeting that the Korean people will never allow their irreconcilable enemy Eisenhower to come to South Korea. The chief executioner Eisenhower, upon becoming President of the United States (January 1953), wantonly bombed Korean cities and villages, killing countless peaceful residents. The Korean people absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch Eisenhower, the head of the American imperialist murdering robbers, crawl into South Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th - Seoul News: More than 150 residents of Busan held an anti-American demonstration on the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in South Korea for a "visit," demanding that the U.S. government pay them compensation for the serious losses caused to Busan residents by a fire caused by the rupture of a U.S. military oil pipeline three years ago.
    At around 10:30 yesterday morning, residents, regardless of the suppression by the puppet police, held a demonstration for more than an hour, holding up placards with slogans such as "Pay us 100 million hwan immediately."
    According to the South Korean News Agency, forty-five residents were burned to death and one hundred and forty shacks were destroyed in the fire three years ago. For a long time, especially the families of those burned to death in the fire and the residents of Busan have harbored great hatred and dissatisfaction with American imperialism. Most of those who participated in the demonstration this time were family members of the deceased.

    新华社平壤19日电　据这里报纸报道：朝鲜北部开城、海州、元山、咸兴、新义州等市在17日和18日共有二十多万群众举行大会，反对艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜进行强盗旅行。
    在靠近军事停战线的开城市，17日举行了五万人的大会。妇女代表孙延京在会上讲话时说，艾森豪威尔是美帝国主义杀人犯的头子，他屠杀了朝鲜无数母亲的孩子和无数孩子的母亲。由于他实行的分裂朝鲜的政策，使我们亲爱的父母兄弟、亲戚朋友隔着一条军事分界线不能相见，而且连封信也不能通。我们绝不容许这个强盗头子爬上我们祖国的土地。
    在咸兴市，18日举行了六万人的大会。朝鲜劳动党咸兴市委员会委员长金泰龙在会上讲话时指出，今天的亚洲不是美帝国主义能够横行霸道的亚洲，今天的朝鲜人民也不是忍受虐待和压迫的过去的朝鲜人民。他高呼：艾森豪威尔立即滚回老家去！
    新义州市18日举行了五万人的大会。工人代表李钟学在会上说，朝鲜人民绝不容许不共戴天的敌人艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜来。刽子手头子艾森豪威尔（1953年1月）一当上美国总统就大肆轰炸朝鲜的城市和农村，杀死了无数的和平居民。朝鲜人民绝不能坐视美帝国主义杀人强盗的头子艾森豪威尔爬到南朝鲜。
    新华社平壤19日电　汉城消息：釜山市一百五十多名居民在艾森豪威尔到达南朝鲜“访问”前夕举行反美示威，要求美国政府付给他们赔偿费，赔偿三年前因为美国侵略军的油管破裂所引起的一场火灾给釜山居民造成的严重损失。
    昨天上午十时半左右，居民们不顾伪警察的镇压，高举着标语牌，举行了一个多小时的示威。标语牌上面写着“立即付给我们一亿圜”等字样。
    据南朝鲜通讯社报道，三年前的那场火灾，有四十五名居民被烧死，一百四十个窝棚被烧毁。长期以来，特别是在火灾中被烧死的人的家属和釜山居民们对美帝国主义怀着很大的仇恨和不满。这次举行示威的人当中大部分是死者的家属。
