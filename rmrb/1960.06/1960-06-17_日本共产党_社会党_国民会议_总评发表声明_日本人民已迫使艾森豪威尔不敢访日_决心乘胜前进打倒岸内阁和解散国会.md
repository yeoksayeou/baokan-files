Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement tonight regarding the Kishi Nobusuke government's forced request for Eisenhower to postpone his "visit" to Japan, calling on the people to continue the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet on the basis of preliminary victory.

The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's decision "is a great victory brought to the people by the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the Kishi cabinet and the American imperialists for a year and a half."

The statement pointed out that this victory is a victory for the united action of the Japanese people. This preliminary victory of the Japanese people has made a significant contribution to peace in Asia.

The statement pointed out: Kishi Nobusuke continues to disregard the voices of the Japanese people, and in his statement, he still clamored about some "international communist conspiracy" and declared that he would continue to rule until the revised Security Treaty is approved.

The statement said, "Therefore, Japanese democratic forces should continue to wage unyielding struggles on the basis of the first victory already achieved, demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, the establishment of a caretaker government composed of all anti-Kishi (Nobusuke) forces, followed by a general election presided over by the caretaker government."

The statement said: "In order to make these goals possible, let us boldly launch multi-faceted struggles of people from all walks of life in Japan, with a general strike of workers as its core. Let us persevere in the struggle against the American government and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which are trying to impose the Security Treaty on the Japanese people."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Japanese Socialist Party held an emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee tonight and issued a statement on the cabinet's decision to request Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan indefinitely, pointing out that this is a victory for the Japanese people.

The statement also said, "We will fight on until the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resigns, the Diet is dissolved, and the 'Security Treaty' is abolished."

The statement said that under the impact of the unprecedentedly large-scale people's movement, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet has been pushed to the brink of collapse. At the same time, we cannot forget that Michiko Kamba (the female student who was beaten to death by the armed police of the Kishi Nobusuke government on the evening of the 15th) was killed by the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of trampling on democracy. We will never forget this atrocity. The anger of the people will continue to rise until the 'Security Treaty' is crushed."

Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma said at a press conference tonight, "Kishi Nobusuke should resign immediately. We will continue to fight to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and dissolve the Diet before the 19th (the day the so-called new 'Security Treaty' automatically comes into effect)."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement on the 16th, firmly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign en masse as soon as possible and dissolve the Diet.

The statement said that in the face of the Japanese people's anger, the Kishi Nobusuke government was finally forced to postpone inviting Eisenhower to visit Japan. The statement said that it is regrettable that the Kishi Nobusuke government still ignores the will of the people, instigates the police and violent groups to use violence, and made this decision after creating a bloody tragedy.

The statement demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet take responsibility and resign en masse as soon as possible and dissolve the Diet, demanding the release of arrested demonstrators and the dismissal of the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, who was responsible for using force to harm students.

The statement stated that the Japanese people will launch unified actions, including a powerful general strike, on the basis of today's victory and continue the struggle to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th: Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, issued a statement regarding the postponement of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, pointing out that this matter means that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's conspiracy to complete the Japan-U.S. alliance through Eisenhower's visit has been severely hit by the Japanese people's unified action to strive for peace and democracy.

The statement said that the "General Council of Trade Unions" is determined to further carry out national unified action to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    日本共产党  社会党  “国民会议”  总评发表声明
    日本人民已迫使艾森豪威尔不敢访日
    决心乘胜前进打倒岸内阁和解散国会
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会今天晚间就岸信介政府被迫要求艾森豪威尔延期
  “访问”日本一事发表声明，号召人民在初步胜利的基础上为打倒岸信介内阁而继续斗争。
  声明说：岸信介政府的决定“是日本人民一年半以来为反对岸内阁和美帝国主义者而进行的爱国正义斗争为人民带来的伟大胜利”。
    声明指出，这一胜利是日本人民统一行动的胜利。日本人民的这一初步胜利，对亚洲和平作出了重大的贡献。
    声明指出：岸信介仍然继续不顾日本人民的呼声，他在声明中还叫嚣什么“国际共产主义的阴谋”，并宣称他将继续执政直到修改后的安全条约获得批准。
    声明说，“因此，日本民主力量应当继续在已经获得的第一个胜利的基础上，继续进行不屈不挠的斗争，要求岸内阁立即辞职，解散国会，成立由所有反岸（信介）力量组成的看守政府，随后在看守政府主持下举行大选。”
    声明说：“为了使这些目的能够实现，让我们果敢地展开日本各阶层人民的多方面的斗争，而以工人总罢工为其核心。让我们坚持不渝地同竭力想把安全条约强加于日本人民的美国政府和岸信介政府进行斗争。”
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天晚间举行中央执行委员会紧急会议，就内阁决定要求艾森豪威尔无限期延期访问日本一事发表声明，指出这是日本人民的胜利。
    声明同时说，“我们将斗争下去，直到岸信介内阁辞职、国会解散、‘安全条约’被废除。”
    声明说，在史无前例的声势浩大的人民运动的冲击之下，岸信介内阁已被推向崩溃的边缘。同时我们不能忘记，桦美智子（15日晚上被岸信介政府的武装警察打死的女学生）是岸信介政府践踏民主的政策所杀害的。我们永远不会忘记这种暴行。人民的愤怒将不断高涨，直到‘安全条约’被粉碎。”
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天晚间在记者招待会上说，“岸信介应该立即辞职。我们将继续进行斗争来推翻岸信介内阁，并使国会在19日以前解散（这一天正是所谓新“安全条约”自动成立的日子）”。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”16日发表声明，坚决要求岸信介内阁尽速总辞职和解散国会。
    声明说，在日本人民的怒火面前，岸信介政府终于被迫延期邀请艾森豪威尔访日。声明说，但是岸信介政府仍然忽视人民的意志，唆使警察和暴力团体施用暴力，在制造流血惨案以后才作出这个决定，这是很遗憾的。
    声明要求岸信介内阁承担责任，尽速总辞职和解散国会，要求释放被捕的示威者，罢免动武残害学生的负责人警视厅总监。
    声明表示，日本人民将在今天胜利的基础上展开包括强有力的总罢工在内的统一行动，继续斗争到底。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章就艾森豪威尔访日延期一事发表声明指出，这件事意味着岸信介内阁企图以艾森豪威尔访日来完成日美同盟的阴谋受到日本人民争取和平与民主的统一行动的严重打击。
    声明说，“总评”决心进一步开展全国统一行动来推翻岸信介内阁，解散国会和阻止批准新“安全条约”。
