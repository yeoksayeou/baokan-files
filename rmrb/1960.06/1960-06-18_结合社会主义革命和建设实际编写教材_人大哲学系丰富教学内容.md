(Xinhua News Agency, June 17th) Teachers and students of the Philosophy Department of Renmin University, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, have carried out academic research through the current political struggle, conducted social investigations by going down to the countryside and factories to participate in production labor, and vigorously promoted teaching reform, achieving significant victories. The draft textbooks "Marxist Philosophy Textbook" and "Logic," compiled by teachers and students, have now been published.

In order to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, the teachers and students of this department established the Mao Zedong Philosophy Works Research Association in early 1958 and extensively carried out special research on Mao Zedong's philosophical thought. Since the beginning of this year, teachers and students have launched scientific research and academic criticism with even greater enthusiasm. The forty-seven teachers and students of the Chinese Modern Bourgeois Philosophy Criticism Group successively read over 54.4 million words of classical works and critical materials in three months, compiled "Selected Materials on Chinese Modern Bourgeois Philosophy," and compiled a "Collection of Critical Essays on Modern Chinese Bourgeois Philosophy" based on special research. In the textbook construction of these philosophy major courses, the teachers and students of this department are actively striving to study, master, and apply Mao Zedong Thought. For example, when compiling the "Marxist Philosophy Textbook" (first draft), they changed the past situation of some textbooks being divorced from reality and starting from definitions, and tried their best to combine it with the development of China's socialist revolution, especially the reality of socialist revolution and construction since the Great Leap Forward, highlighting the class nature and practicality of Mao Zedong's philosophical thought, and using materialist dialectics to focus on expounding Comrade Mao Zedong's major development of Marxist philosophy. They all paid attention to studying the theoretical and practical issues in the current socialist revolution and construction, and worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, as well as the Party's guidelines and policies. At present, they have compiled a total of twenty textbooks, lecture notes, special research papers, annotations of classical works, and materials.

Going down to factories and the countryside to participate in production labor and actual work, conducting social investigations, and popularizing Mao Zedong's philosophical thought to the workers and peasants have become an important part of the teaching reform in this department. When lecturing on "Dialectics of Nature," the teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's dialectical thinking on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and sent people to conduct investigations in people's communes in sixteen counties in five provinces. Based on the results of the investigation and research, a special chapter was set up in the teaching to teach. (Attached picture)

    结合社会主义革命和建设实际编写教材
    人大哲学系丰富教学内容
    据新华社17日讯　中国人民大学哲学系师生以毛泽东思想为指导，通过当前政治斗争开展学术研究，结合下乡下厂参加生产劳动开展社会调查，大搞教学改革，已取得重大胜利。师生们编写的“马克思主义哲学教科书”、“逻辑学”等教材初稿，现在已经出版。
    这个系的师生，为了系统地学习马列主义和毛泽东著作，1958年初成立了毛泽东哲学著作研究会，广泛地开展了毛泽东哲学思想的专题研究。今年年初以来，师生们以更高的热情展开科学研究和学术批判。中国现代资产阶级哲学批判小组四十七名师生，在三个月内先后阅读了经典著作和批判资料达五千四百多万字，整理出“中国现代资产阶级哲学资料选编”，并在专题研究的基础上编写出一部“现代中国资产阶级哲学批判论文集”。在进行这些哲学专业课程的教材建设中，这个系的师生都在积极努力学习、掌握和运用毛泽东思想。如在编写“马克思主义哲学教科书”（初稿）时，改变了过去某些教科书脱离实际、从定义出发的状况，尽力结合我国社会主义革命的发展情况，特别是大跃进以来社会主义革命和建设的实际，突出了毛泽东哲学思想的阶级性和实践性，运用唯物辩证法，着重阐述了毛泽东同志对于马克思主义哲学的重大发展。他们都注意研究当前社会主义革命和建设中的理论问题和实际问题，刻苦钻研马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作以及党的方针政策。目前，他们已经编写出来的教材、讲义、专题研究论文、经典著作注释和资料共达二十项。
    下厂下乡参加生产劳动和实际工作，进行社会调查，通俗地向工农群众宣传毛泽东哲学思想，成了这个系教学改革中的一个重要组成部分。在讲授“自然辩证法”时，师生们研究了毛主席关于“农业八字宪法”的辩证思想，又派人到五省十六县的人民公社进行调查，根据调查研究的成果，在教学中设置专章讲授。（附图片）
