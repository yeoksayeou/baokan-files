Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd. Hubei Province's work of rushing to harvest summer crops is progressing rapidly. By the end of May, more than half of the province's barley, wheat, and bean crops had been harvested, with Xiangyang and Huanggang prefectures having harvested 78% and 80% respectively. The counties of Suixian, Zaoyang, Yicheng, Gucheng, Nanzhang, Xinzhou, Qichun, Xishui, Guangji, Huangmei, Echeng, and Yunmeng in Wuhan City in these two prefectures have completed all or most of their harvests and are now making every effort to rush transplant mid-season rice and rush to plant sesame, millet, soybeans, and other summer-sown crops. Many golden fields that were billowing with wheat waves a few days ago have now been replaced with new green attire.

During the summer harvest and planting, Hubei Province, from large and medium-sized cities to rural market towns, all industries vigorously supported the summer harvest and planting. At present, 150,000 cadres at all levels in the province have gone to the countryside to rush harvest and plant with commune members; together with officers and soldiers of the armed forces, enterprise employees, school teachers and students, and urban residents, the province has sent millions of people to the countryside to support the summer harvest and planting, of which Xiangyang, Jingzhou prefectures, and Wuhan City alone have sent more than one million people.

The area of summer crops in Hubei Province this year has been greatly expanded compared to last year, with the area of food crops expanded by about 35% compared to last year, and they are generally growing well. The area of mid-season rice and other summer-sown crops has also been expanded compared to previous years, and the quality requirements are high. In order to ensure the sustained leap forward in agricultural production this year, grasping the summer harvest and planting is crucial. To this end, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all industries in the province to mobilize and vigorously support the summer harvest and planting. From the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the ministers of the various departments of the Provincial Party Committee, and the heads of the various departments and bureaus of the government, down to the leading cadres at the prefecture, county, and commune levels, they all took the lead in going deep into the communes, production teams, and fields to participate in production and lead production.

In addition to drawing some personnel to go to the countryside to directly participate in rush harvesting and planting, the industrial, transportation, and financial and trade departments in various places have also strengthened support for the summer harvest and planting from all aspects in conjunction with their own businesses. Many factories are processing and rushing to manufacture and repair summer harvest and planting farm tools day and night. According to statistics from ten counties in the suburbs of Wuhan City, the industrial and handicraft departments organized more than 10,000 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to help production teams repair and equip more than one million various farm tools and agricultural machinery. The financial and trade departments in Huanggang Prefecture organized more than 330,000 person-times to deliver goods to the countryside, delivering more than 400,000 various summer harvest and planting tools and farm implements. The cultural and health departments have also taken actively supporting the summer harvest and planting as an important task at present.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Various industries in the urban areas and county towns of Shanghai have transferred a large number of people to support the summer harvest and planting in rural areas. More than 500,000 labor army that has been organized has recently set off for the front line of rush harvesting and planting.

The area of summer-ripening crops such as wheat and rapeseed planted in the rural suburbs of Shanghai this year has increased by 38% compared to last year. These crops are growing unprecedentedly well. The summer planting area has also increased significantly compared to last year. In order to make the summer harvest and planting work fast and good, the urban areas and towns have organized a large number of people to go to the countryside to provide support. School teachers and students, government cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are the main force of this support army. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and government cadres are all vying to participate in the support team. Before departure, many school teachers and students have made their own action plans and written letters of determination, expressing their desire to exercise themselves in labor and contribute to this year's bumper harvest. When teachers and students of the Shipping College harvested rapeseed in Donggou Commune, Pudong County, in order to avoid rapeseed pods from falling and bursting, they and the commune members started harvesting every morning at three o'clock before the dew was dry, and many people also took out their sheets to wrap the rapeseed and to cushion under the rapeseed stalks during threshing.

While actively participating in labor, the workers, commercial personnel, and medical workers who support the summer harvest and planting also contribute their strength according to their respective specialties. The Shanghai city workers who helped the communes manufacture new farm tools for summer harvesting and planting in the previous period went deep into the production teams after the summer harvesting and planting began, to repair farm tools for the commune members. In order to provide convenience to the commune members and enable them to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the summer harvest and planting, commercial personnel from various counties carried peddler's loads and patrolled the countryside. Medical workers also carried medicine boxes and shuttled through the fields to serve the commune members. The workers in Luwan District factories who supported Pudong County also organized a mechanical repair team to repair machinery for the communes and production teams. The Nanhui Hotel in Nanhui County also sent six chefs to the production teams to help run the canteen and increase the variety of meals, so that the commune members could eat well and have enough to eat during the busy summer harvest and planting season.

In order to better summarize the experience of this year's bumper summer harvest and guide next year's production, Shanghai's agricultural scientific and technical personnel also organized observation groups for wheat and rapeseed. Some teachers and students from the Biology Departments of Fudan University, East China Normal University, Shanghai Normal College, and Shanghai Agricultural College also actively participated in the summary of production experience. The scientific and technical personnel who went to the countryside all carried computers, balances, and tape measures, inspecting while laboring during the day, and performing calculations, analysis, and discussions in the evening. The commune members warmly welcomed their activities.

This newspaper reports that while grasping production, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province are also grasping canteen management, making the canteen a capable logistics department in the battle of summer harvest and planting.

Across the province, 150,000 cadres have gone deep into canteens to strengthen leadership. Many canteens in various regions have established vegetable gardens and staple and non-staple food processing plants under the direct leadership of cadres. More than half of the 28,800 canteens in Liaocheng Prefecture have met the "Five Good" requirements (democratic management, grain saving, cooking utensil reform, food and beverage adjustment, cleanliness and sanitation).

At present, canteens throughout Shandong Province have planted more than one million mu of vegetables, raised more than 375,000 pigs, as well as a large number of poultry. The spring vegetables planted in many canteens have begun to be harvested, and each person can eat two to three catties of fresh vegetables per day. Some canteens have also pickled pickles from the vegetables they have harvested. Because the canteen has established a solid foundation, it has prepared a rich material basis for supporting the busy season of summer harvest and planting. Many areas have saved a large amount of grain to adjust life during the busy farming season because they have been able to plan ahead and manage resources carefully. For example, more than 15,000 canteens in the Linyi area have saved more than 40 million catties of grain since the beginning of the year. The Huli Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Tancheng County allocated a portion of its reserve grain in advance to grind flour in advance, ensuring that it could be used for half a month to 20 days without milling after the wheat harvest began, so as to free up labor and livestock to invest in the summer harvest and planting.

In order to adapt to the characteristics of concentrated farm work during the summer harvest and planting, canteens in various places have put forward the slogan "Wherever production goes, meals, dishes, and tea are delivered there." At present, Linyi, Yantai, Jinan and other regions have begun to establish "military canteens," field tea stoves, and build cool sheds to ensure that meals are hot, dishes are hot, and tea is not lacking.

    抽调人员　赶制农具　送货下乡　背药到田
    湖北上海各行各业大力支援夏收夏种
    山东十五万干部下食堂安排夏收期间社员生活
    据新华社武汉2日电　湖北省夏收作物的抢收工作进展迅速。到5月底为止，全省大麦、小麦和豆类作物已经收割达一半以上，其中襄阳、黄冈两专区已分别收割了78％和80％以上。这两个专区的随县、枣阳、宜城、谷城、南漳、新洲、蕲春、浠水、广济、黄梅、鄂城和武汉市的云梦等县，已经全部或基本收割完毕，目前正全力抢插中稻和抢种芝麻、粟谷、黄豆等夏播作物。许多在几天前还翻腾着麦浪的金色的田野，现在已换上了绿色的新装。
    在夏收夏种中，湖北省从大、中城市到农村集镇，各行各业大力支援夏收夏种。目前，全省各级机关干部已有十五万人下乡，和公社社员一起抢收抢种；连同部队官兵、企业职工、学校师生和城镇居民在内，全省先后下乡支援夏收夏种的已是数以百万计，其中仅襄阳、荆州两专区和武汉市，就已有一百多万人下乡。
    湖北省今年夏收作物面积比去年扩大了很多，粮食作物的面积比去年扩大35％左右，而且普遍生长良好。中稻和其他夏播作物的面积也比往年有所扩大，而且质量要求高。为了保证今年农业生产持续跃进，抓好夏收夏种是一个关键。为此，中共湖北省委号召全省各行各业动员起来，奋力支援夏收夏种。从省委书记、省委各部部长和政府各厅、局负责人直到地、县、公社各级领导干部，都带头深入到公社、生产队和田间，参加生产，领导生产。
    各地工业、交通、财贸部门除抽调部分人员下乡直接参加抢收抢种以外，还结合本身业务从各个方面加强对夏收夏种的支援。许多工厂日夜加工赶制和修理夏收夏种农具。据武汉市郊十个县的统计，工业和手工业部门即组织了铁、木、篾工一万多人到各生产队帮助修配好了各种农具、农业机械一百多万件。黄冈专区财贸部门组织送货下乡已达三十三万多人次，送各种夏收夏种工具、农具四十多万件。文化和卫生部门也把积极支援夏收夏种作为当前的一项重要任务。
    新华社上海2日电　上海市区和各县城镇的各行各业调出大批人力支援农村夏收夏种。已组织起来的五十多万劳动大军，最近陆续开赴抢收抢种第一线。
    上海市郊农村今年种植的三麦、油菜等夏熟作物比去年增加38％。这些作物生长空前良好。夏种面积也比去年增加许多。为了使夏收夏种工作搞的又快又好，市区、城镇都组织了大批人力下乡支援。学校师生、机关干部和解放军官兵是这次支援大军的主力。解放军官兵和机关干部都争着参加支援队伍。许多学校师生出发前都订出了自己的行动规划，写了决心书，表示要在劳动中锻炼自己，同时为今年的丰收出一把力。船舶专科学校的师生在浦东县东沟公社收割油菜时，为了避免油菜落荚、爆裂，他们和社员一起每天早晨三点钟在露水未干前就开始收割，许多人还拿出自己的被单来包扎油菜和脱粒时垫在油菜秆底下。
    支援夏收夏种的工人、商业人员和医务工作者，在积极参加劳动的同时，还根据各自特长贡献自己的力量。前一时期帮助各公社制造夏收夏种新农具的上海市下乡工人，在夏收夏种开始后，又深入生产队，为社员们检修农具。为了给社员以方便，使他们全心全意投入夏收夏种，各县商业人员挑着货郎担巡回农村。医务工作者也背着药箱穿梭田间，为社员服务。支援浦东县的卢湾区各工厂工人，还组织了机械检修小组，为各公社、生产队修理机具。南汇县的南汇饭店还派出了六名厨师，到生产队帮助搞好食堂，增加饭菜花色品种，使社员们在紧张的夏收夏种季节中吃饱吃好。
    为了更好地总结今年夏熟大丰收的经验，指导明年的生产，上海市农业科学技术人员还组织了三麦、油菜考察团。复旦大学、华东师范大学、上海师范学院生物系以及上海市农业专科学校的部分师生也积极参加生产经验的总结工作。下乡的科学技术人员都带着计算机、天平、皮尺，白天边劳动，边检查，晚上进行计算分析、讨论研究。社员们对他们的活动十分欢迎。
    本报讯　山东省各级党委在抓生产的同时，大抓食堂管理，使食堂成为夏收夏种战斗中的得力后勤部。
    全省各地已有十五万干部深入食堂加强领导。许多地区的食堂在干部直接领导下，建立了菜园和主副食品加工厂。聊城专区两万八千多个食堂有半数以上达到了“五好”（民主管理、节约粮食、炊具改革、饭菜调剂、清洁卫生好）要求。
    目前，山东全省食堂共种菜一百多万亩，养猪三十七万五千多头，以及大量的家禽。许多食堂种植的春菜已开始收获，每人每天可吃二至三斤鲜菜。有些食堂收下的蔬菜除吃用外，还腌制了酱菜。由于食堂建立雄厚的家底，为支援夏收夏种大忙季节准备了丰富的物质基础。不少地区由于做到了瞻前顾后，细水长流，节省出大批粮食用来调剂农忙时的生活。例如临沂地区一万五千多处食堂，从年初以来，已节省粮食四千多万斤。郯城县城关公社湖里大队，提前拨出一部分储备粮提前磨面，保证麦收开始后可以半月到二十天内不用推磨，以便腾出劳力和牲畜投入夏收夏种。
    为适应夏收夏种农活集中的特点，各地食堂都提出“生产到哪里，饭菜、茶水送到哪里”的口号。目前临沂、烟台、济南等地区已开始建立起“随军食堂”、田间茶炉和搭盖凉棚，保证饭热、菜热，茶水不缺。（附图片）
