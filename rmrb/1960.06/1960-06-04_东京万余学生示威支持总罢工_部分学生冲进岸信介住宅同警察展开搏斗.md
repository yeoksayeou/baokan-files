Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd: Approximately fifteen thousand Japanese students began various demonstrations starting at 3:00 PM today to support the general strike to be held by Japanese workers on the 4th. These students, under the leadership of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," took action throughout the night, including fifteen hundred junior high school students.

The students first held a rally in Shimizu Valley Park. The National Railway Workers' Union, which will hold a general strike tomorrow, sent a letter to the students, expressing that the union accepts the students' support with heartfelt gratitude. The letter received thunderous applause from the students.

Speaking at the student rally were Socialist Party Diet members, former leader of the National Railway Workers' Union Toshiaki Yokoyama, and Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga.

Yokoyama Toshiaki said that the national railway workers are about to carry out the largest strike since the war. Every time they engage in a struggle of strength, they are subjected to disciplinary actions taken by the government, but they cannot be intimidated.

Yoshio Shiga called on people from all walks of life to give strong support to the striking workers.

After holding the rally, the students began to march in an orderly manner towards Nobusuke Kishi's official residence and the U.S. Embassy. They held a spirited demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy, chanting, "Yankee go home!" "Take the black jets home!"

After demonstrating in front of the U.S. Embassy and Nobusuke Kishi's official residence near the Diet, they continued to advance to the center of Tokyo's bustling streets. As the demonstrating students passed through the lively streets, many people waved to the students from the street-facing windows of buildings or from the windows of streetcars. The students also distributed a large number of leaflets to passersby. All the passersby who received leaflets read them attentively.

The demonstrating students also held a rally in front of the National Railway Workers' Union headquarters near Tokyo Station, expressing their full support for the union's workers.

The Secretary-General of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, Haji Yamada, said in his address to the students that the workers of this union in Tokyo have made preparations for their strike. He also announced that the same preparations have been made not only in Tokyo but also in six other major cities.

Yamada said: The Japanese railway workers, angered by the tyrannical actions of the Nobusuke Kishi government, will gloriously stand at the forefront of tomorrow's great struggle. The students responded with thunderous applause.

Yamada called on the students to support the workers' struggle so that the combined strength of people from all walks of life can overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government and abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as soon as possible.

The students responded to Yamada's call, shouting: "Long live the cooperation between workers and students!"

At six o'clock, the students divided into many teams and went to various major train stations in Tokyo to join the workers who would be picketing there overnight.

Meanwhile, another group of students, including about four thousand students from Tokyo University, Waseda University, Meiji University, Chuo University, and more than a dozen other universities, also held a rally in front of the Diet, expressing their support for the general strike scheduled for the 4th.

After the meeting, they held powerful demonstrations around the Diet. Then they surged towards the front gate of the Prime Minister's official residence, stormed into Nobusuke Kishi's residence through the gate, and entered the courtyard, clashing with seven hundred police officers guarding the residence. The students also pushed four armored vehicles in the yard out onto the street.

Many students were injured in the clashes with the police, some seriously. Thirteen people were arrested.

After two hours of clashes, at about seven o'clock in the evening, the students withdrew from the courtyard of Nobusuke Kishi's residence and gathered near Hibiya Park, joining the night school students gathered there. Then they dispersed and went in batches to the main train stations to join the workers picketing there. (Attached picture)

    东京万余学生示威支持总罢工
    部分学生冲进岸信介住宅同警察展开搏斗
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：大约一万五千名日本学生今天从下午三时开始展开种种示威活动，来支持日本工人将于4日举行的总罢工。这些学生是在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”领导下通夜采取行动的，其中有一千五百名中学生。
    学生们首先在清水谷公园举行大会。将于明天举行大罢工的国营铁道工会给这些学生一封信，表示这个工会以衷心感激的心情接受学生们的支援。这封信获得了学生们暴风雨般的掌声。
    在学生大会上讲话的有社会党国会议员和国营铁道工会前领袖横山利秋以及共产党代表志贺义雄。
    横山利秋说，全国铁路工人即将进行战后最大的一次罢工。在他们每次进行实力斗争的时候，他们都遭受到政府所采取的纪律行动的迫害，可是他们是吓不倒的。
    志贺义雄在会上呼吁其它各界人民应当对罢工工人给予有力的支持。
    学生们在举行了集会之后，开始有秩序地向岸信介的官邸和美国大使馆进发。他们在美国大使馆前面举行了斗志昂扬的示威，高呼：“美国兵滚回去！”“把黑色喷气机撤回家去！”
    他们在美国大使馆前和国会附近的岸信介官邸前举行示威之后，继续前进到熙熙攘攘的东京的大街的中心。当示威的学生们通过热闹的大街的时候，许多人都从建筑物的临街的窗口或从电车的窗口向学生们挥手。学生们还向过路的人们散发了大批的传单。所有收到传单的过路人都专心地阅读这些传单。
    示威的学生们还在东京车站附近的国营铁道工会总部前举行了集会，表示他们对这个工会的工人全力支持。
    日本国营铁道工会书记长山田耻目在向学生们致意时说，东京的这个工会的工人们已经作好了他们进行罢工的准备工作。他还宣布，不仅在东京，而且在其他六个重要的大城市中都已经作好了同样的准备工作。
    山田说：被岸信介政府的蛮横行动激怒的日本铁道工人，将光荣地在明天的伟大斗争中站在最前列。学生们听了之后报以雷动的掌声。
    山田呼吁学生们支持工人的斗争，从而使各阶层人民联合起来的力量能够推翻岸信介政府并尽早废弃新日美“安全条约”。
    学生们响应山田的号召，高呼：“工人和学生之间的合作万岁！”
    在六点钟的时候，学生们分成许多队，走到东京的各个主要火车站去同将通宵在那里纠察的工人汇合。
    同时，另一批学生，包括东京大学、早稻田大学、明治大学、中央大学以及十多个其他大学的约四千名学生也到国会前举行大会，表示他们支持预定在4日举行的工人总罢工。
    会后，他们纷纷在国会周围举行强大的示威。然后他们涌向首相官邸大门口前面，冲进岸信介住宅的大门而进入住宅的院子，同警卫的七百名警察发生冲突。学生们还把在院子里的四辆装甲车推到大街上去。
    许多学生在同警察冲突中受伤，有些受了重伤。十三人被逮捕。
    经过两小时的冲突之后，大约在晚上七点钟的时候，学生们退出岸信介住宅的院子，到日比谷公园附近，同聚集在那里的夜校学生们汇合。然后他们散开，分批走到主要火车站去，同在那里纠察的工人们汇合。（附图片）
