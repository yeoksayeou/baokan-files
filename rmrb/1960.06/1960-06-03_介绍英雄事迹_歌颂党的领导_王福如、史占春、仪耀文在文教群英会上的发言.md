Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd – At the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education held today, Wang Furu, a specially invited representative from a PLA Guard Unit, Shi Zhanchun, Captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, and Yi Yaowen, First Secretary of the Jishan County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, spoke one after another.

Wang Furu, a specially invited representative from a PLA Guard Unit, spoke first. He introduced how this guard unit studied culture under the cordial care and encouragement of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and the education and encouragement they received from Chairman Mao's great selfless work and study spirit. He said that the rapid improvement in the cultural and political level of the soldiers in their first company is inseparable from the care and teachings of our beloved leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao took time out of his busy schedule to talk with the team members and encourage them to study hard, master scientific knowledge, become intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds, and do more work for the people. As early as 1955, in a conversation with members of the first company, he taught them to strive to learn culture, master scientific knowledge, become intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds, and do more work for the people. Later, he often inquired about the learning situation of the team members and often raised some common scientific knowledge questions to stimulate the team members' desire for knowledge. Chairman Mao also encouraged the guards to set up factories and learn from labor production, combining work, study, and labor to cultivate everyone into revolutionary cadres who are both cadres, students, and workers, and become well-rounded in both literary and military skills.

Wang Furu said that under the cordial care and encouragement of Chairman Mao, the comrades of the first company completed their cultural learning tasks while completing guard and military training tasks. They will have their middle school graduation exams this September and are scheduled to hold the opening ceremony of higher education on National Day. He said that in teaching, they also implemented the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of combining education and labor, rapidly improved their cultural level and production knowledge, and received an extremely profound education on the general line of socialist construction in productive labor. While transforming their thinking and improving their consciousness, they further realized the great significance of cultural education serving the politics of the proletariat. He expressed that they will unswervingly follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and climb the peak of cultural and scientific knowledge.

Wang Furu's speech moved all the representatives deeply. During his speech, the audience burst into rounds of applause.

Shi Zhanchun, Captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, introduced the process of the Chinese Mountaineering Team conquering the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, which was warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

Shi Zhanchun, as the representative of the advanced collective – the Chinese Mountaineering Team, announced in his speech: The three members of the Chinese Mountaineering Team who conquered Mount Everest collected nine rock specimens from the summit of Mount Everest. The mountaineering team will send these specimens to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. At this time, the audience erupted in a long, storm-like applause.

After vividly introducing the process of conquering the world's highest peak, Shi Zhanchun said that the victory in climbing Mount Everest should first be attributed to the great Party. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for our victory.

He said that the great support and help given to the mountaineering team by the people of the whole country, especially the people of Tibet, is also an important reason for the victory.

Shi Zhanchun said that all this has given us great encouragement and impetus. We know that it is not only our two hundred people who are climbing, but we are representing the 650 million people of China to complete a task of historical significance. Shi Zhanchun introduced the spirit of collectivism and mutual assistance displayed by all the mountaineering team members, the heroic spirit of sacrificing themselves for the honor of the collective, and the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, and many other vivid deeds. Shi Zhanchun's speech won rounds of enthusiastic applause from the representatives.

Yi Yaowen, the First Secretary of the Jishan County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, a nationally renowned rural health red banner county, reported to the conference on the county's situation of holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continuously carrying out the patriotic health campaign. He said that the health campaign in Jishan County has now entered a new stage. Now the face of the vast rural areas of the county is brand new compared to the past. The four pests are nowhere to be seen, the villages are bright and clean, everyone is healthy, labor attendance and labor efficiency are further improved, and people's living habits and mental outlook have undergone profound changes.

Yi Yaowen said that in the past few years of health work, they have deeply realized that only by holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously launching mass movements with the spirit of continuous revolution, and better solving the relationship between health and production and other work, can we continuously achieve great victories. In the mass movement, they have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions, going deep into key areas, establishing the "Sun Village" as a red banner, continuously popularizing the experience of "Sun Village" throughout the county, and continuously improving the level of "Sun Village," and then popularizing it again, and then improving it again, so that the movement continues to move forward. In addition, according to Mao Zedong Thought, they have implemented the policy of walking on two legs in health work, on the one hand, relying on the masses to vigorously build professional organizations, and on the other hand, relying on professional organizations to guide mass movements, so that these two aspects promote each other and continuously develop and improve. Yi Yaowen finally said that the achievements of our county's health work can be concentrated into one point, that is, the victory of the Party's general line of socialist construction and the Party's health work policy, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the health front.

    介绍英雄事迹　歌颂党的领导
    王福如、史占春、仪耀文在文教群英会上的发言
    新华社2日讯　在今天举行的全国文教先进工作者代表大会上，解放军某警卫部队特邀代表王福如、中国登山队队长史占春、中共山西稷山县委第一书记仪耀文等三人先后发言。
    来自解放军某警卫部队特邀代表王福如首先发言，他介绍了这个警卫部队是怎样在敬爱的领袖毛主席亲切关怀和鼓励下学习文化的情形，以及毛主席那种伟大的忘我的工作和学习精神对他们的教育和鼓舞。他说，他们一中队战士们文化、政治水平获得飞速提高是和敬爱的领袖毛主席的关怀和教导分不开的。毛主席在百忙中抽出时间来和队员谈话，鼓励他们好好学习。早在1955年接见一中队队员的一次谈话中，就教导他们要努力学习文化，掌握科学知识，成为工农出身的知识分子，多为人民作点工作。以后，又经常询问队员的学习情况，并且常常提出一些普通的科学常识问题启发队员们的求知欲望。毛主席还鼓励警卫战士们办工厂，从劳动生产中学习，使工作、学习、劳动结合起来，培养大家成为既是干部，又是学生，又是工人，成为文武双全的革命干部。
    王福如说，在毛主席的亲切关怀和鼓励下，一中队的同志在完成警卫和军训任务的同时，也完成了文化学习任务。他们今年9月就要举行中学毕业考试了，并且预定在国庆节举行高等教育的开课典礼。他说，他们在教学中还贯彻执行了党和毛主席的教育和劳动相结合的方针，迅速提高了文化水平和生产知识，并且在生产劳动中受到了极其深刻的社会主义建设总路线的教育；在改造思想、提高觉悟的同时，进一步体会到了文化教育必须为无产阶级的政治服务的重大意义。他表示他们今后要坚定不移地遵循着毛主席指引的方向前进，攀登文化科学知识的高峰。
    王福如的发言使全体代表听了都极为感动。在他发言中，全场响起了一阵又一阵的掌声。
    中国登山队队长史占春的发言，介绍了中国登山队这次征服世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的经过，受到了全体代表的热烈欢迎。
    史占春作为先进集体——中国登山队的代表，在发言中宣布：中国登山队三名征服珠穆朗玛峰的队员，在珠穆朗玛峰顶峰采集了九块岩石标本。登山队将把这些标本送给我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。这时候，全场爆发出长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。
    史占春在生动地介绍了这次征服世界最高峰的经过以后说，取得这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，首先应该归功于伟大的党。党的领导是我们这次取得胜利的根本保证。
    他说，全国人民特别是西藏人民给予登山队的巨大支援和帮助，也是取得这次胜利的重要原因。
    史占春说，这一切，使我们受到了极大的鼓舞和鞭策。我们知道，这不仅是我们二百多人在登山，我们是在代表全中国六亿五千万人民完成一件有历史意义的任务。史占春介绍了全体登山队员发挥集体主义、团结互助的精神，为了集体荣誉不惜自我牺牲的英雄气概，以及冲天的革命干劲等许多生动的事迹。史占春的发言博得了代表们一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    来自全国著名的农村卫生红旗县——山西省稷山县的中共县委第一书记仪耀文向大会报告了这个县高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，持续地开展爱国卫生运动的情况。他说，稷山县的卫生运动目前已进入一个新的阶段。现在全县广大农村的面貌比原来焕然一新，到处不见四害，村村光明洁净，人人身体健康，劳动出勤和劳动效率更加提高，人们的生活习惯和精神面貌进一步发生了深刻的变化。
    仪耀文说，几年来的卫生工作中，他们深深体会到，只有高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，以不断革命的精神持续地大搞群众运动，并且更好地解决卫生和生产以及其他工作关系问题，才能不断取得巨大的胜利。在群众运动中，他们一直遵循着毛主席的指示，深入重点，树立了“太阳村”这一面红旗，不断在全县普及“太阳村”的经验，又不断提高“太阳村”的水平，然后再普及，再提高，使运动不断向前发展。此外，他们还根据毛主席思想，在卫生工作中贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，一方面依靠群众大力建设专业组织，一方面依靠专业组织指导群众运动，使这两个方面互相推动，不断发展和提高。仪耀文最后说，我县卫生工作所以能够取得这些成绩，集中为一点，就是党的社会主义建设总路线和党的卫生工作方针的胜利，是毛泽东思想在卫生战线上的胜利。
