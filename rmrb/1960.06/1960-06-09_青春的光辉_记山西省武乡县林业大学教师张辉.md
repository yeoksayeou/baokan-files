    The Radiance of Youth
    —Remembering Zhang Hui, Teacher at the Wuxiang County Forestry University in Shanxi Province
    By Our Correspondent Feng Dongshu
    Zhang Hui is a recent university graduate, but she has established a new university in the mountain valleys of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province. This accomplishment is widely known throughout the Taihang Mountains, and the school has earned a high reputation among the people.
    A Southern Girl Arrives in the Taihang Mountains
    Zhang Hui is twenty-five years old this year, born in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and studied in Wuhu, Anhui. After graduating from Anhui Agricultural College in September 1958, she was initially assigned to the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Science Research Institute. She had long envisioned herself as a scientist and was naturally very satisfied with such a position. However, only two weeks into the job, Wuxiang County decided to establish a forestry university and requested teachers from the province. The leadership spoke to her, hoping she would go. Zhang Hui had never left the city since she was a child, and having just arrived in the north, the idea of working in the remote mountains of the Taihang Mountains caused her to be conflicted. If she agreed to go, she would have to abandon her newly established scientific research plan and the ideal working conditions she currently had, which she was reluctant to do. If she refused, she was a member of the Communist Youth League and had taken the lead in writing a letter of determination to obey organizational assignments when she graduated from university. How could she possibly refuse? She was restless all day during the conversation. Seeing this, her comrades gave her a copy of "What Kind of Aspirations Should a Communist Party Member Have?" She read it carefully and gradually felt better. The next day, the Director of the Provincial Forestry Bureau asked her if she had made up her mind, and she answered decisively, "I'll go!"
    On October 15th, she arrived in Lianyuan Village, the location of Wuxiang County Forestry University. She originally did not have high expectations for this university, thinking it would at least be better than an ordinary primary school! But when she arrived, she saw that the university was like this: the school did not have a single tile or a single wall, and the students all lived in the homes of the local people; the so-called classroom was originally a cowshed that had not yet been repaired; her office was also a borrowed civilian house, with only a broken table and two bottles of ink inside. In short, the university had almost nothing except for fifty students. Seeing this situation, coupled with her inability to understand the local dialect, her dislike of the local food, and the need to climb mountains whenever she went out, she wavered and wanted to return to Taiyuan. But when she saw the dozens of pairs of eyes of the students eagerly awaiting her, and thought of the education she had received from the Party and the state, she felt that she should stay. At this moment, Comrade Xi Jian, the First Secretary of the Wuxiang County Party Committee, and Comrade Wang Zhenguo, the Secretary of the Secretariat, came to see her, asked her what difficulties she was facing, and encouraged her not to bow her head in the face of difficulties, as the Party was supporting her. Secretary Wang also said to her: "People from the south are used to hardships when they come to the north, especially to the mountainous areas of the north, but for the sake of the revolutionary cause, what do we Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members consider suffering!" They also told her the stories of many southern female comrades who struggled arduously in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War. The Party's care and trust made Zhang Hui determined to move forward firmly in the direction pointed out by the Party.
    With Determination, Difficulties Can Be Overcome
    Secretary Wang Zhenguo, concurrently served as the principal of Wuxiang County Forestry University. He was very busy and could not always stay at the school. There were two teachers in the school, and Zhang Hui was mainly responsible for the school's work. At that time, there were many problems in the school's work, the most urgent of which was that the students did not have a clear understanding of the purpose of their studies, and seeing the poor conditions of the school, they were very unstable. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the first thing Zhang Hui did when she arrived at the school was to conduct communist education for the students. She herself served as a political instructor and repeatedly explained the purpose of learning to the students in class; she told the students stories about the relationship between forests and people's lives outside of class; and she personally led the students to participate in the afforestation movement in the commune, so that the students could understand the commune's urgent need for forestry technical cadres. After her lively political education, the students developed a strong interest in their major and their emotions stabilized.
    However, the material difficulties did not decrease as a result. The school had very little funding, no desks for classes, no books for reading, no tools for production, and no mimeograph machine for printing lecture notes. What to do? The path pointed out to her by the Party was to rely on her own efforts through work-study programs, but where to start? Finally, she came up with an idea. It turned out that Zhang Hui started school halfway through, and before liberation, she had worked as a child laborer, boiled soap, and knitted socks. She thought she could pick up her old skills again and process goods for the county department store, wouldn't the school have funding then! She was so excited that she immediately wrote a letter to her father telling him about this idea. Her father, a labor model in a factory in Xuzhou, sent her an enthusiastic letter with the formula for boiling soil lye and boiling soap with lime, and repaired an old sock knitting machine and sent it to her. When she once again shook the familiar sock knitting machine, she was so excited that many past events flooded into her heart. If it hadn't been for the Communist Party, how could a child laborer have become a university student? She thought silently, and many difficulties that seemed insurmountable in the past seemed to become smaller and more insignificant at this time. After that, her will to overcome difficulties became even more firm. She taught the technology to the students, and the school began to have income. In order to expand the school's construction fund, in addition to leading students to grow eighty acres of nursery, whenever she had the opportunity, she would lead students to state-owned forest farms and communes to work and produce, tirelessly trying to find production opportunities for the school.
    With a little income, she bought a mimeograph machine, made more than thirty desks, bought more than five hundred books, and solved some of the students' food problems. At this time, Zhang Hui wanted to build some houses. She went to discuss it with another teacher, who said there was no money, so forget it. How could no money be a reason? Didn't this school start up without any money? She felt that it had to be built. The school couldn't stay so dilapidated forever. She went to the County Party Committee, and the County Party Committee supported her idea and instructed her to find a way to solve the problem and save money among the masses. So she studied with the masses, little by little, what materials to use for building houses, how much to use, and how to build them most economically. Finally, she drew up a school construction plan. The plan was sent to the County Party Committee and was quickly approved, and 3,000 yuan was immediately allocated to the school. The construction of the new school building began. The commune heard about the construction of the school and also sent people and vehicles to support it. Zhang Hui led the students to carry wood, transport bricks and tiles, and dig stones every day. When it was windy and rainy and others didn't want to work, she took the lead. As a result, twenty-three new school buildings were built in a very short period of time. Since then, the face of Wuxiang County Forestry University has been completely changed.
    Bold Reform and Humble Learning
    Wuxiang County Forestry University enrolls students who have graduated from higher primary school, many of whom are production team leaders in the commune. It is obviously impossible to teach such a group of young people with a high level of expertise using the set of methods that Zhang Hui learned. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Party, and based on the purpose of training and the level of the students, Zhang Hui carried out bold reforms in teaching. She made appropriate deletions to history and geography, and adopted a comprehensive explanation method for seed science, nursery science, afforestation science, and management science. At the same time, she added two local courses: fruit tree science and sericulture. General cultural courses are taught according to the courses of junior and senior high schools. In order to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor and theory with practice, the school usually insists on half-day classes and half-day nursery labor; during the afforestation season, the students are withdrawn to the communes to help with work and conduct internships. In this way, over a period of four years, a group of forestry technical cadres with a cultural level reaching the level of senior high school and professional knowledge reaching the level of university junior college can be trained for the entire county.
    Although Zhang Hui had attended university for a few years and knew a lot of theoretical knowledge, she didn't have much practical experience in the past. Now the school has planted eighteen acres of nursery, and she often has to go to the commune to carry out afforestation movements. She has to lead the students in plowing, hoeing, and harrowing, and she doesn't know how to do many jobs. What to do? She is not afraid of not knowing, but she is afraid of pretending to know. Zhang Hui's attitude is to be honest. If she doesn't know, she will learn from the old farmers. If there are students who are good at farming, she will not hesitate to ask them to learn from them. After working for a period of time, her back and legs ached, but she never went back halfway. Everyone saw that she was very determined and was willing to teach her, so she quickly learned the technique of driving livestock and supporting the plow. In order to combine indigenous and foreign technologies, she also invited forestry worker Li Xianlin and forestry expert Wei Yaozhen from Wuxiang County to give lectures to the students. She sat with the students and listened carefully, took notes carefully, and finally raised their specific experiences to the theoretical level, as a component of the professional course incorporated into the teaching content.
    Great Happiness
    After two years of hard work, Wuxiang County Forestry University has been consolidated. Students are about to begin studying senior high school cultural courses, and professional courses such as nursery science, surveying, and plant taxonomy have been completed. Although the students have not yet graduated, they have become an important technical force in the county's forestry development. Every afforestation season, they become technicians and are active in various mountains. Not only that, but in the past two years, Zhang Hui has also combined teaching with leading students to produce products such as pine needle oil, roasted glue, wild plant essential oil, sawdust chemical floor, and pesticides, which has greatly enriched the students' knowledge, increased the country's wealth, and increased the school's funding.
    Zhang Hui is not satisfied with some of the achievements that have been made. Recently, according to the instructions of the County Party Committee, she began to busy herself with new action plans. In order to give full play to the potential of the Forestry University, she has formulated a plan to use this university to train forestry cadres from various communes and management areas in Wuxiang County in rotation. She has also formulated a comprehensive plan for the rational distribution of scenic forests, timber forests, and fruit tree forests for various communes in the county. This is not enough. She has also linked up with the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Science Research Institute and re-formulated a scientific research plan. She wants to work with all teachers and students in the school to treat the entire Wuxiang County as an experimental field and carry out research work in conjunction with teaching. Their main focus is to achieve high-yield forestry. After two years of practical work, Zhang Hui has increasingly fallen in love with the mountainous area of Wuxiang, and she has made up her mind: as long as the Party needs her, she will work in the mountainous area for the rest of her life. Why love the mountains? In her own words: "It is a great happiness to be able to dedicate one's youth to the construction of the Party and the people in the mountainous areas."

    青春的光辉
    ——记山西省武乡县林业大学教师张辉
    本报记者　冯东书
    张辉，是个从大学毕业不久的大学生，但是她在山西省武乡县山沟里却办了一个新的大学。这个事迹在太行山区流传得很普遍。这所学校在群众中已经树立了很高的声誉。
    南方姑娘来到了太行山
    张辉今年二十五岁，出生在江苏的徐州，学习在安徽的芜湖。1958年9月，她从安徽农学院毕业以后，先是被分配到山西省林业科学研究所。她早就憧憬自己能成为一个科学家，对这样一个工作岗位自然是很满意的。但是刚干了两个星期，就碰上武乡县创办林业大学向省里要教师。领导上找她谈，希望她去。张辉从小没有离开过城市，而且又是初到北方来，现在突然要她到太行山的山沟沟里去工作，她思想波动起来了。说去吧！想到自己刚订好的科学研究规划和眼前这样理想的工作条件，实在有点不想去；说不去吧，自己是个共青团员，大学毕业时还带头写过服从组织分配的决心书，又怎么能说得出口呢！谈话这一天，她简直坐卧不宁。同志们见她这样，就送了本“共产党员应该有什么样的志愿”给她，她仔仔细细地把它读了一遍，心里渐渐愉快起来了。第二天，省林业局局长问她考虑好了没有，她干脆地回答：“去！”
    10月15日，她来到了武乡县林业大学的所在地——连元村。她原来对这所大学并没有很高的奢望，心想大概总不至于比一所普通的小学差吧！但是到现场一看，这所大学竟是这个样子：学校没有一片瓦、一堵墙，学生都分别寄住在群众家里；所谓教室，原来是个牛圈，还没有修好；她的办公室也是借用的民房，里面就只有一张破桌子和两瓶墨水。总之这所大学除了五十名学生以外，几乎是一无所有。看到这种情况，再加上说话不懂，当地饭食吃不惯，出门就得爬山，她又动摇了，想回太原去。可是当她看见学生们几十双热烈期待着她的眼睛，想起党和国家对她的培养，又觉得应当留下来。正在这个时候，中共武乡县委第一书记希俭同志和书记处书记王振国同志来看她来了，问她有什么困难，鼓励她不要在困难面前低头，有党在支持她。王书记并对她说：“南方人到北方，尤其是到北方的山区，生活是艰苦些，但是为了革命事业，我们共产党人、共青团员吃些苦算得了什么呢！”他们并给她讲抗日战争时期许多南方女同志在太行山艰苦斗争的故事。党的关怀，党的信任，使张辉下定了决心，坚定地按照党给她指出的方向前进。
    有决心就能克服困难
    武乡县林业大学的校长是王振国书记兼的，他工作很忙，不能经常呆在学校里。学校里共有两名教师，学校工作主要由张辉负责。当时学校工作中的问题很多，其中最迫切的问题，是学生对学习的目的认识不清，又看到学校条件很差，情绪很不稳定。根据县委指示，张辉到学校第一件事，就是向学生进行共产主义教育，她自己担任政治教员，在课堂上给学生反复讲解学习的目的性；在课外给学生讲有关森林和人民生活关系的故事；又亲自带领学生到公社去参加造林运动，让学生了解公社对林业技术干部的迫切需要。经过她这样生动活泼的政治教育以后，学生们对自己的专业发生了浓厚的兴趣，情绪稳定下来了。
    但是物质上的困难并没有因此而有所减轻，学校经费很少，上课没有课桌，阅读没有图书，生产没有工具，印讲义也没有油印机。怎么办？党给她指出的道路是勤工俭学自力更生，但是从哪里入手呢？最后她终于想出办法来了。原来张辉上学是半路上上的，解放前她当过童工，熬过肥皂，织过袜子，她想现在把老手艺再拾起来，给县百货公司加工，学校经费不就有了着落了吗！她兴奋得马上把这个想法写信告诉了她父亲，她父亲是徐州市一个工厂的劳动模范，他给她来了封热情洋溢的回信，并且附来了她要的用石灰熬土火碱和熬肥皂的配方，还把一台老织袜机修好寄了来。当她再一次摇起她熟悉的织袜机的时候，心里太激动了，多少往事涌上了她的心头，要不是共产党，一名童工怎么能成了一名大学生呢？她这样默默地想着，面前的许多过去看来是无法克服的困难，这时候好像变得越来越渺小，越来越微不足道了。这以后她克服困难的意志就更加坚定了。她把技术教给了学生，学校开始有收入了。为了扩大学校建校基金，她除了领导学生种好八十亩苗圃外，只要有机会，她就领着学生给国营林场和公社劳动生产，不辞劳苦地想一切办法给学校找寻生产门路。
    刚有了点收入，买下了油印机，作了三十几张课桌，买了五百多本图书，解决了一下学生的伙食问题。这时，张辉又想修建一些房子，她去和另一位教师商量，那位教师说没有钱，算了吧。没有钱怎么能成为理由呢？这所学校不就是在没有钱的情况下办起来的么？她觉得非盖不可，学校总不能老这样破破烂烂下去。她去找县委，县委支持她的想法，并指示她到群众中去找寻一条既能解决问题，又节省的办法。于是盖房子要用什么料，用多少，怎么盖最省，她一点一点的和群众研究。最后她拟出了一个学校建设规划。计划送到县委，很快得到了批准，并立即拨了三千块钱给学校。新校舍的建设工程就开工了。公社听说建设学校，也派人派车来支援。张辉每天领着学生抬木料、运砖瓦、挖石头。刮风下雨别人不想干了，她带头干。结果终于在很短的时间内盖起了二十三间新校舍。从此彻底改变了武乡县林业大学的面貌。
    大胆改革虚心学习
    武乡县林业大学招收的都是高小毕业水平的学生，其中不少是公社里的生产队长。要把这样一批年轻人培养成有较高水平的专业人材，要按张辉学的那一套来教显然是行不通的。于是张辉按照党的指示，根据培养的目的和学生的水平，又在教学上进行了大胆的改革，她对历史、地理进行了适当的删节，对种子学、苗圃学、造林学、经营学采取了综合讲解的办法，同时增加了两门本地需要的果树学和蚕桑学。一般文化课则按初、高中的课程来上。为了贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合、理论联系实际的方针，学校平常坚持半天上课，半天下苗圃劳动；到造林季节，就把学生撤到各公社去，一边帮助工作，一边进行实习。这样，计划经过四年，就能为全县培养出一批文化水平达到高中程度，专业知识达到大学专科水平的林业技术干部来。
  张辉虽然上过几年大学，理论知识知道不少。可是过去实际干的时候并不多，现在学校里种了十八亩苗圃，还要经常到公社去搞造林运动，耕、锄、耙都得自己领着学生干，很多活她都不会干。怎么办呢？不怕不会，就怕不懂装懂，张辉的态度是老老实实。不会，就拜老农为师，学生中有种地种得好的，她也不耻下问地向他们学。开始干上一段时间，就腰酸腿痛，但是她决不中途回去。大家见她决心挺大，也都乐意教，所以赶牲口扶犁耕地这套技术，她很快就学会了。为了把土洋技术结合起来，她还把林业工人李先林和武乡县的林业土专家魏尧珍请来给学生讲课，自己和学生坐在一起听，仔细记，最后再把他们的具体经验提高到理论上，作为专业课的一个组成部分纳入教学内容。
    莫大的幸福
    经过两年的苦战，武乡县林业大学已经巩固下来了。学生即将开始学高中的文化课，苗圃学、测量学、植物分类学等专业课已经学完了。学生虽然还没有毕业，却已经成了全县发展林业中一支重要的技术力量，每到造林季节，他们就成了技术员，活跃在各个山头。不仅如此，近两年来，张辉还结合教学，领导学生造出了松叶油、烤胶、野生植物芳香油、锯末化学地板、农药等产品。大大丰富了学生的知识，又为国家增产了财富，为学校增加了办校基金。
    对于已经取得的一些成绩，张辉并不满足。最近根据县委的指示她又开始为新的行动计划忙开了。为了充分发挥林业大学的潜力，她已经制定了一项通过这所大学来轮训全武乡县各公社、管理区林业干部的计划。并已经为全县各公社制定出了合理分布风景林、木材林和果树林的全面规划。这还不够，她和山西省林业科学研究所又挂上了钩，重新制订了科学研究规划，她要和全校师生一起，把整个武乡县当成试验场，结合教学来开展研究工作。他们的主攻方向是要使林木也来一个高额丰产。经过二年来的实际工作，张辉越来越爱上了武乡山区，她立下了心愿：只要党需要，就在山区干它一辈子。为什么要爱山区？用她自己的话来说：“能为党为山区人民的建设事业献出自己的青春是莫大的幸福。”
