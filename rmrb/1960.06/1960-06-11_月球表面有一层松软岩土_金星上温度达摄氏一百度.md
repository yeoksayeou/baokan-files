    The Moon's Surface Has a Layer of Loose Soil
    Venus's Temperature Reaches 100 Degrees Celsius
    The world's largest radio telescope, located near Moscow, has recently provided scientists with valuable information about the Moon, Venus, and other planets.

    Materials recently obtained by Soviet scientists using this telescope have confirmed that the Moon's surface is covered with a porous or loose layer of soil. Oxides of iron and other metals have been found in the soil. According to the acquired materials, the thickness of this loose soil layer is more than ten centimeters.

    Scientists have also used this telescope to measure the temperature beneath the lunar surface. It is now known that the temperature beneath the lunar surface only rises after prolonged exposure to sunlight. Deeper layers are not "sensitive" to sunlight at all; the temperature there remains constant at minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius.

    Soviet scientists have also used this telescope to measure the temperature of Venus. Based on materials obtained from radio waves passing through the extremely dense clouds of Venus, the temperature on Venus is approximately 100 degrees Celsius.

    月球表面有一层松软岩土
    金星上温度达摄氏一百度
    设在莫斯科近郊的目前世界上最大的无线电天体望远镜，最近为科学家们提供了许多有关月球、金星等星球的宝贵材料。
    苏联科学家们最近用这台望远镜所测得的材料确定，月球的表面是被一层多孔的或是松软的岩土复盖着的。并在岩土里发现有铁和其他金属的氧化物。根据获得的材料得知，这种松软的岩土层的厚度达十公分以上。
    科学家们还用这台望远镜测知了月球地层下的温度，现在已经知道月球地层下的温度只是在太阳光长时间照射之后才能上升，而在较深的地层下面对太阳光根本是没有“感觉”的，那里的温度始终是在摄氏零下二十至三十度。
    苏联科学家们用这台望远镜还测得了金星的温度，根据从金星上通过极浓的云层的无线电波所提供的材料得知，金星上的温度约为摄氏一百度。
