        Thorough, Rapid
    To develop production at high speed, we must have high-standard goals. For factories and mining enterprises, this high standard is an advanced and reliable production plan.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a large number of innovation projects have emerged, and production efficiency has increased exponentially. In such a situation, timely promotion of advanced experience and rapid incorporation of the results of technical innovation into the production plan have become important guarantees for establishing high standards and formulating advanced production plans.
    The more thoroughly the results of innovation are applied to production, the higher the standards are set, and the more advanced the production plan is formulated. In this regard, the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory has set a very good example for us. The important reason why this factory was able to formulate a production plan in June that was 17% higher than the state plan, with a significant reduction in personnel, was that they absorbed 35 major innovation projects created in May into the plan. The factory's reflection of innovation results was not only thorough but also rapid. The sixth work section of the second workshop developed a planing machine that increased production efficiency by 50%. As soon as the previous shift succeeded, the next shift immediately adjusted the shift production plan according to the new quota.
    Thorough and rapid reflection of innovation results also reflects the work style of leading cadres. Currently, a large number of leading cadres are going to the front lines of production. Many factories are seizing the last half month to strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, and are also starting to formulate production plans for July. At this time, it is even more important to vigorously promote the timely dissemination of advanced experience and rapidly incorporate all innovation results into the operation plan for the second half of June and into the production plan for July.

    彻底　迅速
    要高速度地发展生产，必须要有高标准的努力目标。对厂矿企业来说，这个高标准就是既先进又可靠的生产计划。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，大量革新项目的出现，生产效率成倍地提高，在这样的情况下，及时推广先进经验，把技术革新的成果迅速纳入生产计划中去，就成为树立高标准、制订先进生产计划的重要保证。
    革新成果运用于生产，运用得越彻底，标准就树得越高，生产计划就订得越先进。在这方面，天津纺织机械厂为我们树立了一个很好的榜样。这个厂在人员大量减少的情况下，6月份所以能够制订一个比国家计划高出17％的生产计划来，重要的原因就是他们在计划中吸收了5月份创造的三十五项重大革新项目。这个厂反映革新成果，不仅彻底，而且迅速。二车间六工段搞成了一台刨光机，生产效率提高了50％，上一班一搞成，下一班马上根据新定额调整了班产计划。
    彻底迅速地反映革新成果，也是领导干部工作作风的反映。目前，大批领导干部正在纷纷开赴生产第一线，许多工厂一方面抓紧最后半个月，力争上半年完成全年计划一半，一方面开始着手制订7月份的生产计划。这时候，狠抓先进经验的及时推广，把一切革新成果迅速纳入6月下半月的作业计划，纳入7月份的生产计划中去，就显得更加重要了。
