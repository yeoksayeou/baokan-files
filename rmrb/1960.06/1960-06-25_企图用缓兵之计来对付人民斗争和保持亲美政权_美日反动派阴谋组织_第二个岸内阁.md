Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 24th: After Nobusuke Kishi was forced to decide to resign, U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are conspiring to organize a "Second Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet."

According to today's "Asahi Shimbun" report, Nobusuke Kishi and Eisaku Sato (Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother), the head of the Sato faction within the ruling party, are currently engaged in activities aimed at preserving their power and influence in the new government. They advocate that the basic policy of the next government must be to "promote the security treaty system" and "restore public order," and to exclude the anti-mainstream factions within the ruling party from the new cabinet. Kyodo News Agency said: In his statement indicating his resignation, Nobusuke Kishi particularly emphasized "party consolidation," saying that the next cabinet "should move toward a new policy of confronting collective violence and international communist forces." "This is the Prime Minister's attempt to have the next cabinet inherit the legacy of the Kishi cabinet in promoting the new security treaty system, seek to preserve the Kishi-Sato system in the next cabinet, and at the same time suppress the activities of anti-mainstream factions who hold different views on the current situation."

According to radio reports, the Kishi faction and the Sato faction held a meeting last night to study the issue of "not allowing anti-mainstream factions to take office in the next government."

The Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy is being carried out according to the will of U.S. and Japanese monopoly capital. Tokyo radio said that Japanese monopoly capital hopes to form a "new, powerful cabinet." This new cabinet should "propose measures to eliminate violence and maintain public order." Japanese monopoly capitalists also expressed the hope that Nobusuke Kishi's successor would be able to "clean up the chaotic political situation, sweep away the public's unease, and restore the trust of the United States." The U.S. "Washington Star" openly said: "It must be hoped that the Kishi Nobusuke government will be succeeded by a government that also advocates freedom."

Before forming a "Second Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet," U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are using Nobusuke Kishi's announcement of his "determination to resign" to ease public anger, implement "delaying tactics," and postpone the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections in order to buy time and allow Nobusuke Kishi to strengthen the suppression of the people's increasingly high patriotic struggle before stepping down. The conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is so obvious that even the French "Le Monde" said: "Nobusuke Kishi's resignation...is a resignation that serves to delay, and the right-wing precisely intends to use this delay to enable it to salvage the situation."

Nobusuke Kishi convened a cabinet meeting today to study so-called "public order countermeasures" to strengthen the suppression of the people. Nobusuke Kishi openly said at the meeting: Although he has already indicated his resignation, "I believe that it will still take a considerable amount of time to designate the prime minister to form a cabinet." He asked his cabinet members to "deal with the situation during this period" in order to "avoid any slackness." The cabinet meeting decided to "expeditiously punish" civil servants participating in the patriotic struggle and decided to establish an "investigation agency."

According to reports, seeing that holding general elections now would be detrimental to the conservative parties, Japanese monopoly capital is also conspiring not to dissolve the Diet immediately after forming a new cabinet to succeed Nobusuke Kishi. They are conspiring to postpone the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections until October of this year after the "people's struggle has calmed down."

    企图用缓兵之计来对付人民斗争和保持亲美政权
    美日反动派阴谋组织“第二个岸内阁”
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：岸信介被迫决定辞职以后，美日反动派正在阴谋组织“第二个岸信介内阁”。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，岸信介和执政党内佐藤派首脑佐藤荣作（岸信介的胞弟）目前正在进行活动，企图在新政府中保存它们的势力和影响。他们主张下届政府的基本政策必须是“推进安全条约体系”，“恢复治安”，并在新内阁中排斥执政党内的反主流派。共同社说：岸信介在表明辞职的谈话中特别强调“整党”，说下届内阁“应朝着同集体暴力和国际共产主义势力对抗的新政策前进”，“这是首相企图使下届内阁继承推进新安全条约体制的岸内阁的遗产，谋求在下届内阁中保存岸、佐藤体系，同时压制对时局持有不同认识的反主流派的活动”。
    据电台报道，岸信介派和佐藤派昨天晚上举行会议，研究了“不让反主流派担任下届政权”的问题。
    岸信介集团的阴谋活动是根据美国和日本垄断资本的意志而进行的。东京电台说，日本垄断资本希望组成“新的强有力的内阁”。这个新内阁要“提出排除暴力，治安对策”。日本垄断资本家并且表示希望岸信介的继任人能够“收拾混乱的政局，一扫国民的不安心情，恢复美国的信赖”。美国的“华盛顿明星报”公开地说：“必须希望岸信介政府由一个同样赞成自由的政府来接替”。
    美日反动派在组成“第二个岸信介内阁”以前，正在利用岸信介宣布“决心辞职”来缓和民愤，实行“缓兵之计”，拖延解散国会和举行大选，以便争取时间，让岸信介在下台以前加强镇压人民日益高涨的爱国斗争。美日反动派的阴谋是这样的明显，甚至法国“世界报”都说：“岸信介的辞职……是一个起拖延作用的辞职，右派正是打算利用这种拖延来使它能够挽回局势”。
    岸信介今天召集内阁会议，研究了加强镇压人民的所谓“治安对策”。岸信介在会上公然说：他虽然已经表明辞职，“但是我认为，要到指定组阁首相还需要相当长的时间”。他要求他的阁员们“在这个期间应该对付事态”，以便“不要出现松懈的情况”。内阁会议决定要“赶紧处分”参加爱国斗争的公务人员，并且决定成立“调查机构”。
    据报道，由于看到现在举行大选对保守政党不利，日本垄断资本还阴谋在组成接替岸信介的新内阁以后，并不随即解散国会。他们阴谋在“人民斗争沉静下来”以后，推迟到今年10月再解散国会，举行大选。
