    Pingyuan—A Red Banner for Phonetic Literacy
    Secretary Takes the Lead, Masses are Full of Enthusiasm
    Eliminating Illiteracy Quickly and Effectively; Learning Forges Ahead
    (Our Newspaper News) Reporter Yu Huiyin reports: Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, has become a red banner in using the Chinese phonetic alphabet to eliminate illiteracy and conduct spare-time cultural, technical, and theoretical education for workers and peasants.
    In the past year or so, Pingyuan County has used phonetic literacy to quickly, efficiently, and economically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and has basically popularized spare-time elementary education. On this basis, it has vigorously established various types and levels of spare-time technical schools combining politics, technology, and culture. Now, out of more than 220,000 young and middle-aged people in the county, about 70,000 are studying in spare-time elementary schools, 105,000 have entered junior technical schools equivalent to junior high school after graduating from elementary school, more than 3,300 have entered intermediate technical schools equivalent to senior high school, and more than 1,000 are studying in three higher spare-time vocational schools and one comprehensive spare-time university, and another 20,000 have entered spare-time normal schools. At present, the county has trained 12,734 industrial and agricultural technical talents through phonetic literacy, and promoted 2,971 cadres from the original illiterate population.
    In July 1958, under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, and the Chinese Language Reform Committee, Pingyuan County began a key experiment in phonetic literacy in Dongwangzhuang, and achieved good results. The actual time it took for illiterate people to learn the phonetic alphabet and recognize 1,500 characters was generally only more than 80 hours (requiring more than two months, studying one or two hours each night). Because they relied on the phonetic alphabet to read and write extensively, they continuously consolidated and expanded the results of literacy. However, at that time, some people did not fully recognize the urgent need of the broad masses to improve their culture and the superiority of phonetic literacy, believing that the phonetic alphabet was difficult to understand, and that it was optional to learn, and that production would be the same even without learning, etc. In response to this erroneous thinking, Zhao Shengwu, the First Secretary of the Pingyuan County Party Committee, personally led the first secretaries of all commune party committees and the party branch secretaries of management districts and production teams to visit Dongwangzhuang, conduct on-the-spot tests, and hold on-the-spot debates, further emancipating their minds. From the county party committee to the commune party committee, the first secretaries all personally took the lead in learning the phonetic alphabet, greatly encouraging the learning enthusiasm of the masses. More than 300,000 young and middle-aged people and many elderly people, young children, and even deaf-mute and blind people throughout the county participated in the movement to learn Chinese phonetic alphabet and speak Mandarin. Everyone wore cloth strips on their bodies, illiterates wore yellow cloth strips, and non-illiterates wore red cloth strips. Those with yellow strips asked those with red strips, and those with red strips taught those with yellow strips. By this year's "May Day," more than 180,000 people had been lifted out of illiteracy. Together with the original non-illiterate population, more than 215,000 of the county's more than 220,000 young and middle-aged people had reached the non-illiterate standard, basically realizing a county without illiterate young and middle-aged people. More than 30,000 various learning models have emerged throughout the county, including 580 "all-red families," 3,200 pairs of model couples learning together, and 3,000 mothers with many children who are good at learning. Phonetic literacy is not only quick, but also effective.
    Pingyuan County not only widely uses Chinese phonetics to eliminate illiteracy, but also continues to play the role of Chinese phonetics in industrial and agricultural spare-time cultural education and technical education after basically eliminating illiteracy in the county, and has achieved great results. All spare-time elementary schools and junior spare-time technical schools in the county implement "phoneticization of teaching materials and pinyinization of learning." A phoneticized "Learn Culture" tabloid has also been specially published. This enables the vast number of people who have recently become literate and whose cultural level is not high to read and learn various books extensively without being limited by the number of Chinese characters they know. In this way, each newly literate student can complete the spare-time elementary school course in only half a year, and then complete the spare-time junior technical school course in another half a year. The young girl Li Junxiang graduated from phonetic literacy in 1958, and continued to use the phonetic literacy method to study, read a large number of phonetic and other reading materials, and improved her cultural level to junior high school level, thus creating 21 scripts and many poems. Among them, three scripts including "Heroes Create Miracles in Saline-Alkali Land" won first prizes in the Liaocheng Special District Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Art Performance in Shandong Province. The students of the comprehensive technical school in Ligusi Management District, Dongwangzhuang Commune, combined their studies with key cotton high-yield experiments, and achieved a high-yield record of 1,150 catties of seed cotton per mu on 100 mu of land.
    The county has also further relied on the Chinese phonetic alphabet to extensively carry out the movement to study Mao Zedong's works. Now, 200,000 people have participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Wang Rihai, a production team leader and a student of the Dongwangzhuang Commune Spare-time Elementary School, used the phonetic alphabet to study "On Contradiction" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and was able to use Mao Zedong's principles on major contradictions and the particularity of contradictions to guide production and work, and also wrote 30,000 words of learning experience.
    In the mass phonetic literacy movement, Pingyuan County established special management agencies at the county and commune levels. The county party committee and commune party committee secretaries not only took the lead in learning, but also adopted the method of running spare-time schools for phonetic literacy secretaries in a big way, cultivating "experimental fields" and "guidance fields," cultivating typical examples, and guiding the general. At present, there are 89 classes of county party committee secretary spare-time schools, 188 classes of commune secretary spare-time schools, and 1,299 classes of party branch secretary spare-time schools throughout the county. In order to improve the quality of industrial and agricultural spare-time education, the Pingyuan County Party Committee, in addition to frequently going deep into various levels of spare-time schools to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, also focused on two networks, namely the spare-time school teacher in-service training network and the teaching and research network. The county has established work-study normal schools and broadcast normal schools, mainly responsible for training main subject teachers for spare-time schools at all levels; each commune and production team has established spare-time normal schools and weekend normal schools, mainly responsible for training general teachers and auxiliary teachers. In the past two years, they have trained more than 5,000 spare-time school teachers and more than 7,000 auxiliary teachers through these methods. The relevant departments at the county level have also set up three teaching and research offices for politics, technology, and culture, and the communes have also set up comprehensive teaching and research offices or teaching and research groups. The county also implemented the practice of one full-time school teacher leading one spare-time teacher. These methods in Pingyuan County have all achieved good results.
    The county party committee has made a decision to strive to popularize spare-time higher education among young and middle-aged people throughout the county in the short term and push the cultural revolution to a new climax. (Attached picture)

    平原—注音识字的一面红旗
    书记亲自动手群众干劲十足
    扫盲又快又好　学习快马加鞭
    本报讯　记者余辉音报道：山东省平原县成了利用汉语注音方法扫盲识字和进行工农业余文化、技术、理论教育的一面红旗。
    一年多来，平原县利用注音识字多快好省地扫除了青壮年中的文盲，基本上普及了业余高小。在此基础上大办政治、技术、文化三结合的各级各类业余技术学校。现在，全县二十二万多青壮年中约有七万人在业余高小学习，十万五千人高小毕业后进入相当初中的初级技术学校，三千三百多人升入了相当高中的中级技术学校，一千多人在三所高等业余专科学校和一所综合性业余大学学习，还有二万人进入了业余师范学校。目前，全县通过注音识字培养了一万二千七百三十四名工农业技术人材，并从原来的文盲中提拔了二千九百七十一名干部。
    1958年7月，平原县在中共山东省委、省文教厅和中国文字改革委员会的领导下，开始在董王庄进行注音识字的重点试验，并取得了良好的效果。文盲由学习注音字母到识一千五百字的实际时间一般只需八十多小时（以每晚学习一、二小时计，需二个多月）。由于依靠注音字母大量阅读和写作，因而不断巩固扩大了扫盲成果。但在当时曾有些人对广大群众提高文化的迫切要求和注音识字的优越性认识不足，认为注音字母不好懂，可学可不学，不学也一样生产等等。针对这种错误思想，中共平原县委第一书记赵胜武亲自率领全县各公社党委第一书记和管理区、生产队的支部书记到董王庄参观，当场测验，当场辩论，进一步解放了思想。由县委到公社党委第一书记全都亲自带头学习注音字母，大大鼓舞了群众的学习热情。全县青壮年和许多老年幼儿以至聋哑盲人共三十多万人，投入了学习汉语注音和讲普通话的运动。人人身上戴布条，文盲戴黄布条，非文盲戴红布条，黄的见了红的问，红的见了黄的教。到今年“五一”，已扫除文盲十八万多人，加上原有的非文盲，全县二十二万多青壮年中就已有二十一万五千多人达到非文盲标准，基本上实现了青壮年无盲县。全县涌现了各种学习模范三万多人，其中有“全家红”五百八十户，夫妻学习模范三千二百对，学习好的多子女母亲三千人。注音扫盲不仅扫得快，而且扫得好。
    平原县不仅广为利用汉语注音扫除文盲，而且在全县基本扫完文盲后，在工农业余文化教育和技术教育中仍然坚持发挥汉语注音的作用，已取得了很大的成绩。全县业余高小和初级业余技术学校都实行“教材注音化，学习拼音化”。并且专门出版了“学文化”的注音小报。这就使得脱盲不久、文化水平还不高的广大群众，不受认识汉字数目的限制，能够大量阅读和学习各种书籍。这样，每个脱盲学员只要半年时间，就可以学完业余高小课程，再用半年时间，就能学完业余初级技术学校的课程。年轻的姑娘李俊香1958年注音扫盲毕业后，继续利用注音识字办法学习，阅读了大量注音读物和其他读物，文化程度提高到初中水平，从而创作了二十一个剧本和许多诗歌。其中“英雄碱地创神迹”等三个剧本，在山东省聊城专区工农业余文艺会演中获得了一等奖。董王庄公社李古寺管理区综合技术学校的学员们，结合学习重点进行棉花丰产试验，获得了亩产籽棉一千一百五十斤的百亩丰产纪录。
    这个县还进一步依靠汉语注音字母广泛开展了学习毛泽东著作的运动。现在，已有二十万人参加了毛主席著作的学习。董王庄公社业余高小学员，生产队长王日海，利用注音字母学习了“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，能够根据毛主席关于主要矛盾和矛盾的特殊性等原理来指导生产和工作，还写出了三万字的学习心得。
    在群众性的注音识字运动中，平原县在县和公社都成立了专管机构。县委和公社党委书记们不但带头学习，而且采取大办注音识字书记业余学校的方式，大种“试验田”和“指导田”，培养典型，指导一般。目前，全县有县委书记业余学校八十九班，公社书记业余学校一百八十八个班，支部书记业余学校一千二百九十九个班。为了提高工农业余教育的质量，平原县委除经常深入各级业余学校发现问题及时解决外，还大抓两个网，即业余学校教师进修网和教学研究网。县里举办了工读师范和广播师范，主要负责培训各级业余学校主科师资；每个公社和生产队都举办业余师范和星期师范，主要负责培训一般教师和辅导教师。两年来，他们通过这些办法，已经培养出业余学校教师五千多人，辅导教师七千多人。在县级有关部门还专门设立了政治、技术、文化三个教研室，公社也设立了综合教研室或教研组。全县还实行了一个全日制学校教师带一个业余教师的做法。平原县这些办法，都收到很好的效果。
    县委已作出决定，力争在短期内在全县青壮年中普及业余高等教育，把文化革命推向新的高潮。（附图片）
