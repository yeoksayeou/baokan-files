    Along the Yellow River and Yangtze River Basins
    People's Liberation Army Supports Wheat Harvest
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces stationed in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins are helping people in various regions to harvest wheat with a combat stance to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat this year.

    Commanders and soldiers in the Shandong area, under the battle cry of "Harvest wheat before it yellows, seize the sunny days and prevent rain to ensure a bumper harvest," worked day and night, leaving early and returning late, working alongside local commune members, cutting, bundling, and transporting wheat to ensure that no stalks are missed, no grains are dropped when bundling, and no ears are lost when transporting, ensuring quality and quantity. By the end of May, they had contributed more than 8,000 workdays, helping people's communes in various regions harvest more than 5,900 mu of wheat. In the past week, more than 20,000 officers and soldiers from the PLA land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai participated in the wheat harvest battle in the suburbs, harvesting more than 5,800 mu of wheat and rapeseed. A certain artillery school in Sichuan also organized a wheat harvest expedition team, rushing to a commune 200 li away on the north bank of the Yangtze River where there was a shortage of labor to help harvest wheat. Encouraged by the scene of a bumper harvest in the vast wheat fields, the officers and soldiers launched a competition of "precise harvesting, meticulous harvesting, more harvesting, and fast harvesting." Silver sickles flashed everywhere, and the wheat was harvested quickly and well. Officers and soldiers from the Nanjing area rushed to the wheat fields in an emergency to launch a "race against the weather" before the storm arrived. Those with sickles used sickles, and those without sickles used their hands to pull the wheat. After cutting, they carried the wheat on their shoulders if they didn't have carrying poles. They harvested more than 600 mu of wheat in a short period. The officers and soldiers also patrolled the fields with the local militia to prevent fires and protect the harvest.

    In order to ensure that wheat is harvested, threshed, transported, and stored quickly and well, the PLA's various technical arms made full use of their expertise to manufacture harvesting tools for farmers in every possible way. A repair factory of a certain unit in the Wuhan area used indigenous methods to rush-produce harvesters for the local commune. They were ingenious, sturdy, low in cost, and highly efficient, and were well received by commune members. The troops stationed in Shanghai also sent out vehicles to support commune members in transporting wheat. (Attached picture)

    沿黄河两岸和长江流域
    人民解放军支援麦收
    据新华社讯　驻长江流域和黄河两岸人民解放军陆、海、空三军部队，正以战斗姿态，帮助各地人民收麦，确保今年小麦丰产丰收。
    山东地区部队的官兵，在“麦黄不过夜，抢晴防雨保丰收”的战斗口号下，披星戴月，早出晚归，和当地社员一起边割、边捆、边运，保证割麦不漏秆、捆麦不掉粒、运麦不丢穗，作到保质保量。到5月底，已作了八千多个劳动日，帮助各地人民公社收割小麦五千九百余亩。驻上海陆、海、空三军部队，一周来，出动了两万多官兵，参加郊区麦收战斗，收割了小麦、油菜共五千八百多亩。四川某炮兵学校还组织了远征麦收突击队，赶到长江北岸二百里外一个劳动力缺乏的公社，帮助抢收小麦，官兵们在万顷麦海的一片丰收景象鼓舞下，展开“精收、细收、多收、快收”对手赛，银镰到处，麦子收得又快又好。南京地区部队官兵在暴风雨即将到来的紧急时刻，奔赴麦田展开“龙口夺粮”大战。有镰刀的用镰刀，没有镰刀的就用手拔；割完后没有扁担挑就用肩扛，在短短的时间内抢收了六百多亩小麦。官兵们还和驻地民兵一起，在田头巡逻放哨，防止火灾，保卫丰收。
    为使小麦收、打、运、藏作得又快又好，解放军各技术兵种发挥了他们的特长，千方百计的为农民制造收割工具。武汉地区部队某修配厂用土法为驻地公社赶制的收割机，灵巧、坚固、造价低廉、工效高，深受社员欢迎。驻上海部队还派出了汽车支援社员运麦。（附图片）
