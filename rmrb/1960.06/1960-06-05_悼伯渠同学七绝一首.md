	In Memory of Comrade Boqu, a Poem in Seven Quatrains
	Li Zhuchen
	Fifty years ago, we were two young men,
	Heartbroken, like Bao Shu, he deeply understood me.
	A friendship as light as water, reaching our twilight years,
	Through wind and rain, at the cock's crow, thoughts arise quietly.

	May 30, 1960, at the Jinjiang Hotel, Shanghai
