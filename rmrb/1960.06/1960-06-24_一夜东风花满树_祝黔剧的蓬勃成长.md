    A Night of East Wind, Trees Full of Blossoms
    ——Congratulating the Flourishing Growth of Qian Opera
    Ma Shaobo
    Qian Opera was created and developed from the folk art of Wenqin (also known as Tanci) which was popular in Guizhou, under the guidance of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." It is the product of the Great Leap Forward under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line since 1958. Thanks to the leadership and attention of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and Party Committees at all levels, the strong support of the broad masses, and the dedicated efforts of comrades in the Guizhou theatrical circles, more than twenty professional Qian Opera troupes and many amateur Qian Opera troupes have been established throughout the province in a short period of just over two years. They have also created many excellent plays and cultivated a large number of new talents quickly, well, and economically. Qian Opera is undoubtedly very unfamiliar to the audience in the capital, but it is truly like a newborn calf, full of vigor. It has so quickly integrated with the emotions of the capital's audience. This time, Qian Opera made its first appearance in Beijing with a brand-new look and immediately won the welcome and love of the broad masses of the audience, once again proving that new things always bring people infinite joy. What kind of power makes "a night of east wind, trees full of blossoms"? Could this have been done or imagined in the old society? Knowing the spring from a branch, when we see that their new plays have a unique style and a high level, when we see that the average age of all the actors is only seventeen years old, but they have already won a fairly solid foundation in performance, we deeply feel the greatness and warmth of the Party and the happiness of the new era!
    The Qian Opera Troupe brought excellent plays such as "Qin Niangmei," "Zhang Xiumei," "Women Miners Platoon," and "Red Flag Canteen" to Beijing this time. "Qin Niangmei" is a folk tale most familiar to the Dong people, describing how in the mid-19th century, a Dong girl named Qin Niangmei resolutely opposed the unreasonable marriage system of "raising a daughter to repay the uncle" (in the past, there was such a rule among the Dong people: a girl was destined to be the wife of her uncle's son from birth). She refused to marry her uncle's son and fled her homeland with her lover, Zhulang, wandering in a foreign land. All the hardships, all the threats and temptations, could not shake her love for Zhulang. Later, Zhulang was brutally killed by the landlord for opposing the landlord's oppression. The unyielding Qin Niangmei stood up to resist, beat the "law drum," gathered the masses of the whole village, and, under the pretext of burying Zhulang's body, tricked the petty landlord Yin Yi into a barren mountain. Qin Niangmei finally killed Yin Yi in the grave he had dug himself. This play is adapted from the traditional repertoire of Dong Opera, which used to be performed for seven days and seven nights. Now the whole play is only three hours long, and new scenes such as "seizing the land" have been added. The new version, on the basis of striving for freedom of marriage, prominently portrays class contradictions, which further enhances the ideological and exciting power of the play.
    The entire performance of "Qin Niangmei" is rich in national characteristics and local life flavor. The structure of the story, the arrangement of the plot, the relationship between the characters, and the development of the contradictions are all very reasonable. There are many customs that we are not familiar with, which seem very fresh and quite cordial. The music and singing are beautiful, melodious, and successfully integrated and developed the musical characteristics of Guizhou Wenqin, Bangzi, and Flower Lantern; the art design, such as clothing and scenery, is both realistic and simple, yet concise and exquisite.
    Young actress Liu Yuzhen, who plays Qin Niangmei, fully expresses the firmness, bravery, intelligence and wisdom of this oppressed Dong girl, especially in the scenes of "searching for bones," "drumming," and "revenge." With delicate performances and moving singing, she portrays Qin Niangmei's strong character of daring to fight, which is quite outstanding. Other young actors such as Wu Jialin, who plays Zhulang, Yu Chongjun, who plays Yin Yi, Xiong Guohua, who plays Naihua, Lu Xiaoxiang, who plays Daku, and Gu Zhulong, who plays Mansong... these young actors played various roles, old and young, performing them realistically and movingly, leaving a deep impression on people.
    However, I personally feel that this script still has shortcomings. It seems that because the author and director are constrained by the limitations of the historical figures, constrained by the fact that Qin Niangmei's struggle could not go beyond the scope of personal struggle, they did not boldly describe the spirit of the masses' struggle in the work. Although the kind character and class friendship of the working people are expressed to some extent, in the expression of class struggle themes, if only the working people's tolerance and general sympathy are described, it will inevitably appear weak.
    "Red Flag Canteen" reflects the profound significance of the struggle between the two roads and resolutely running the commune canteen well, defending this important socialist position, through the establishment and growth of a rural canteen; "Women Miners Platoon" describes the heroic spirit of women in the mountainous areas of Guizhou who have devoted themselves to mining with soaring enthusiasm; "Zhang Xiumei" reflects the historical story of the peasant anti-feudal struggle in Guizhou. Young actors such as Li Jianqing, Cui Yanpeng, Zhang Yushan, and Xu Desen in these three plays are all very promising.
    From the moment of its birth, the Party has attached great importance to Qian Opera, making it closely serve politics and becoming one of the Party's powerful propaganda tools in the cause of revolution and construction. It is under such requirements that Qian Opera has grown rapidly. Let us enthusiastically cheer for the new era, new people, and new flowers, and hope that when Qian Opera comes to Beijing again, it will appear with a newer and more beautiful face.

    一夜东风花满树
    ——祝黔剧的蓬勃成长
    马少波
    黔剧，是在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针指引下，从原来流行于贵州民间的文琴（亦称弹词）的基础上创造发展起来的。它是1958年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下大跃进的产物。由于贵州省委和各级党委的领导和重视，由于广大群众的大力支持和贵州戏剧界同志们的刻苦努力，因而在短短两年多的时间内，全省已建立了二十多个专业的黔剧团和不少的业余黔剧团，并且多快好省地创造了不少的优秀剧目，培养了大批的新生力量。黔剧对于首都观众说来，无疑是非常陌生的，可是，它真如同初生之犊，虎虎有生气，它竟如此迅速地和首都观众的感情融合在一起。这次，黔剧以崭新的姿态，初次进京，立刻获得了广大观众的欢迎和喜爱，又一次证明了新生事物总是给人们带来无限的喜悦。是一种什么样的力量使得“一夜东风花满树”呢？这在旧社会难道是可以做到或者是可以想像的吗？一枝而知天下春，当我们看到他们的新剧目具有独特风格和较高的水平的时候，当我们看到他们全部演员的平均年龄不过十七岁，但在表演上已经赢得相当稳固的基础的时候，深深感到党的伟大和温暖，感到新时代的幸福！
    黔剧演出团此次进京，带来了《秦娘美》、《张秀眉》、《女矿工排》、《红旗食堂》等优秀剧目。《秦娘美》是侗族人民最熟悉的一个民间传说，描写我国十九世纪中叶一个叫作秦娘美的侗族姑娘坚决反对“养女还舅”（过去在侗族中有这样一条规定：女孩子一生下来就注定要给舅父的儿子作妻子）的不合理的婚姻制度，她拒绝嫁给舅父的儿子，与自己的爱人珠郎逃离故土，流落异乡，一切的艰难困苦，一切的威胁利诱，都动摇不了她与珠郎的爱情。后来，珠郎因为反对地主压迫，被地主野蛮地害死了。坚贞不屈的秦娘美挺身反抗，擂起了“法鼓”，召集了全寨的群众，以埋葬珠郎的尸骨为名，设计把小地主银宜骗到荒山。秦娘美终于把银宜打死在他自掘的坟墓之中。这个剧是根据侗剧的传统剧目改编的，过去是要连演七天七夜的，现在全剧不过三个小时，而且增添了“夺佃”等新的场子。新本在原来争取婚姻自由的基础上，突出地刻划了阶级矛盾，更增强了这一剧目的思想性和激动人心的力量。
    《秦娘美》的整个演出富有民族特点和地方生活色彩，故事的结构，情节的安排，人物的关系，矛盾的发展，都是十分入情合理，剧中有许多生活习俗是我们平常所不熟悉的，看来非常新鲜而又相当亲切。音乐唱腔清丽宛转，优美动听，成功地揉合和发挥了贵州文琴、梆子、花灯的音乐特点；美术设计，如服饰、布景等，既真实朴素，又简练精美。
    青年演员刘玉珍饰演秦娘美，充分地表现出这一被压迫的侗族少女的坚贞勇敢和聪明智慧，特别是在“寻骨”、“击鼓”、“复仇”诸场，以细腻的表演、动人的唱工刻划秦娘美的勇于斗争的坚强性格，相当出色。他如饰演珠郎的吴家林，饰演银宜的余重骏，饰演奶花的熊国华，饰演大库的卢孝祥，饰演蛮松的顾筑龙……这些青年演员担任了各种老老少少的角色，演得真实动人，给人们留下了深刻的印象。
    不过，我个人觉得这个剧本还有不足之处。似乎由于作者和导演拘泥于历史人物的时代局限性，拘泥于秦娘美的斗争不可能超出个人斗争的范围，因而在作品中没有放手地描写群众的斗争精神。虽然对于劳动群众的善良性格和阶级友爱有所表现，但是在表现阶级斗争的题材中，如果只描写劳动群众的忍气吞声和一般同情心，就必然显得软弱无力了。
    《红旗食堂》是通过一个农村食堂的建立与成长，反映两条道路的斗争和坚决办好公社食堂，保卫这一社会主义重要阵地的深远意义；《女矿工排》是描写贵州山区妇女以冲天干劲投入开矿劳动的英雄气概；《张秀眉》是反映贵州农民反封建斗争的历史故事。这三个戏中的青年演员如李剑青、崔燕鹏、张玉珊、徐德森等同志都是很有希望的。
    黔剧从一诞生，党就十分重视，使它密切地为政治服务，成为党在革命和建设事业中有力的宣传工具之一。正是在这样的要求之下，黔剧迅速成长起来了。让我们热情地为新时代、新人、新花而欢呼，而且希望黔剧再次进京的时候，出现更新更美的面貌。（附图片）
