    Beat the Dog in the Water, Drive Away the Ambitious Wolf
    Xǔ Guǎngpíng
    The news has arrived that the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, Japan's most reactionary prime minister after the war, Nobusuke Kishi, has been forced to announce his decision to step down. This is another victory for the Japanese people's patriotic anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle. We are pleased with this victory; we applaud the dog falling into the water.
    Recently, the flames of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle have been burning fiercely throughout the country; the revolutionary struggle for independence and democracy has swept the country with a surging momentum. Every peace-loving people in the world expresses infinite admiration and warm support for the Japanese people's patriotic anti-American struggle.
    History will never repeat itself, but the despicable means adopted by all reactionaries in the world are often the same. Before deciding to resign, Nobusuke Kishi desperately struggled to make a last-ditch effort, truly a trapped beast fighting to the end. However, no struggle can save the shameful end of the reactionaries, and Nobusuke Kishi was finally forced to decide to step down. While clinging to power and refusing to step down, the Kishi government orchestrated the "June 15th" bloody massacre; this could not help but remind me of the "March 18th" massacre in Beijing in 1926 by the Northern Warlords. Reactionaries in all countries often regard women and children as great enemies. The cavalry of the Northern Warlords once charged into the student demonstration队伍; the military police of the Japanese reactionaries also fired bullets at the unarmed demonstrators. In order to maintain the interests of foreign masters and their own rule, the reactionary rulers unscrupulously used bloody suppression methods to deal with the righteous people. However, this extremely reactionary behavior cannot but arouse greater anger from the people, to the point of burying themselves. Now, the Japanese reactionaries, like all the traitors in China in those years, are like a dog in the water, trapped in the people's encirclement. Let the people severely punish the traitors! He has committed heinous crimes against the people; let the people bury these reactionaries with staunch struggle!
    Kishi's downfall will inflict a severe blow on the Japanese reactionaries, but all reactionaries will never easily withdraw from the stage of history; they will inevitably make a desperate struggle. The Kishi group once brazenly declared that they "will not carry out a collective resignation or dissolve the Diet before the new security treaty is naturally recognized and approved." Moreover, just minutes before announcing his decision to resign, he secretly exchanged the "instruments of ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with his master, the U.S. imperialists, despite the firm opposition of the Japanese people. This sinful act proves the cunning and shamelessness of the Japanese reactionaries, and more fully proves that the Japanese reactionaries are determined to sell out national interests and resolutely oppose the Japanese people. At the same time, this shameless act also shows that the Japanese reactionaries have fallen into an irreversible predicament and have become a mangy dog in the water. Lu Xun once said: We must beat a drowning dog mercilessly, otherwise, it "will definitely still climb ashore, and if you don't pay attention, it will first shake its body and sprinkle water on people's faces, and then run away with its tail between its legs." All those engaged in revolutionary struggle must clearly see the cunning and shamelessness of the enemy, and profoundly understand how to deal with cunning and shameless enemies.
    The Japanese reactionaries dare to bloodily massacre the people, dare to act perversely, dare to exchange "instruments of ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with U.S. imperialism before deciding to resign, not without reason, but because of the instigation and support of his master. U.S. imperialism is the scourge of the Japanese people, the most vicious "plague god." It is the world's largest bully; it supports the reactionaries of all countries; it instigates the Japanese reactionaries to suppress the people's revolutionary movement; it cruelly enslaves and harms the people through the Japanese reactionaries. However, the heroic Japanese people have personally experienced in their own struggles that U.S. imperialism seems powerful, but it is just a paper tiger. As long as the people are closely united and strive for struggle, it will definitely be defeated. This time, the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, was severely taught a lesson by the Japanese people. Before he even entered Japan, the Japanese people gave him a head-on blow, causing him to flee in panic and dare not "visit" Japan again, which is a good example. Although U.S. imperialism tried its best to cheer and support the lackeys it raised, Kishi Nobusuke, the most loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism, was still beaten into the water by the people. This is another good example. This is a heavy blow to the enemy and a good review of the people's strength.
    Although Kishi Nobusuke has been forced to decide to step down, the struggle has not ended. U.S. imperialism will bring out a second Kishi Nobusuke to continue to be enemies with the people and continue to enslave the Japanese people. The Japanese people understand that only by beating the dog in the water and driving away the ambitious wolf can they obtain freedom, democracy, and independence. The Japanese people firmly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and are determined to drive away the U.S. troops occupying their territory. All these struggles are righteous. All peace-loving people in the world clearly see that the Japanese people's struggle is not only a just action to make their country independent and democratic, but also a significant contribution to world peace.
    Heroic Japanese friends, strive forward! The entire Chinese people are supporting you! Your struggle will surely achieve greater victories.

    痛打落水狗，赶走野心狼
    许广平
    消息传来，美帝国主义的忠实走狗、日本战后最反动的首相岸信介被迫宣布决定下台了。这是日本人民反美反岸爱国斗争的又一胜利。我们为这一胜利感到高兴；走狗落水，我们拍手称快。
    最近以来，日本人民反美反岸斗争的怒火，在全国各地熊熊不已地燃烧起来；争取独立和民主的革命斗争，以汹涌澎湃之势席卷全国。全世界每一个爱好和平的人民，都对日本人民的反美爱国斗争表示无限敬佩，热烈支持。
    历史绝不会重演，然而世界上一切反动派所采取的卑鄙手段却往往是一样的。岸信介在他决定辞职以前，还拼着老命作垂死挣扎，真所谓困兽犹斗。然而，任何挣扎都不能挽救反动派的可耻下场，岸信介终于被迫决定下台了。在赖着不肯下台的时候，岸信介集团布置了
  “六·一五”血腥惨案；这不由得使我想到了1926年在北京由北洋军阀所制造的“三·一八”惨案。世界各国的反动派，都往往把妇女和儿童也视为大敌。北洋军阀的马队曾经冲击过学生游行队伍；日本反动派的军警，也把枪弹射向了手无寸铁的示威群众。反动统治者为了维护外国主子的利益和他们本身的统治，不择手段地用血腥镇压的方法来对付正义的人民。但是，他们这种反动透顶的行为，不能不激起人民更大的愤怒，以致把他们自己埋葬掉。现在，日本反动派和当年中国的一切卖国贼一样，正像一条落水的恶狗，陷于人民的层层包围之中。让人民重重地惩办卖国贼吧！他对人民犯下了滔天罪行；让人民用坚强的斗争埋葬这些反动派吧！
    岸信介要倒台，将使日本反动派遭受到严重的打击，但是一切反动派绝不肯轻易地自动退出历史舞台，他们必然还要作垂死的挣扎。岸信介集团就曾经悍然宣称：他们
  “在自然承认和批准新的安全条约完毕前，也不实行全体辞职，也不解散国会”。并且在他宣布决定辞职的前几分钟，竟然不顾日本全国人民的坚决反对，还偷偷地和他的主子美帝互换日美军事同盟条约的“批准书”。这种罪恶的行为证明了日本反动派的狡猾和无耻，更加充分地证明了日本反动派决心出卖民族利益，坚决同日本人民为敌。同时，这种无耻勾当，也说明了日本反动派已经陷于无法挽回的困境，成了落水的癞皮狗。鲁迅曾经说过：对落水狗必须从而痛打之，否则，它“一定仍要爬到岸上，倘不注意，它先就耸身一摇，将水点洒得人们一身一脸，于是夹着尾巴逃走了”。一切从事革命斗争的人们，都要清楚地看到敌人的狡猾和无耻，深刻地懂得如何去对付狡猾和无耻的敌人。
    日本反动派敢于血腥地屠杀人民，敢于倒行逆施，敢于在决定辞职以前同美帝国主义交换日美军事同盟条约的“批准书”，不是没有原因的，而是由于他的主子的指使和撑腰的结果。美帝国主义是日本人民的祸星，是最凶恶的“瘟神”。它是世界上最大的恶霸，它支持各个国家的反动派，它唆使日本反动派镇压人民革命运动，它通过日本反动派残酷地奴役和损害人民。然而，英勇的日本人民，他们已经从自己的斗争中亲身体会到美帝国主义貌似强大，其实不过是一只纸老虎而已，只要人民紧密团结，努力斗争，它是一定会被打败的。这次，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔，被日本人民狠狠地教训了一顿，当他尚未进入日本境内以前，日本人民就对他来了一个当头棒喝，使他闻风逃窜，不敢再“访问”日本，就是一个很好的例子。尽管美帝国主义千方百计为它所豢养的走狗打气撑腰，然而，美帝国主义那条最忠实的走狗岸信介还是被人民打落到水中去了。这又是一个很好的例子。这是对敌人的一个沉重打击，也是对人民力量的一次很好检阅。
    岸信介虽然被迫决定下台了，可是斗争并没有结束。美帝还会抬出第二个岸信介来，继续与人民为敌，继续奴役日本人民。日本人民懂得，只有痛打落水狗，赶走野心狼，才能得到自由、民主和独立。日本人民坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，决心赶走霸占自己国土的美国军队，所有这些斗争，都是正义的。全世界一切爱好和平的人们都清楚地看到，日本人民的斗争，不但是为了使他们本国获得独立与民主的正义行动，而且也是对世界和平的重大贡献。
    英勇的日本朋友们，努力前进吧！全中国人民在支持着你们！你们的斗争，必将获得更大的胜利。
