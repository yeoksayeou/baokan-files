Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), expressing firm support for the Japanese workers' fourth nationwide general strike to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, dissolve the Diet, and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and extending the most sincere respect to the heroic Japanese workers once again.

The telegram said, "The two general strikes held successively on June 4th and 15th, together with the thunderous and magnificent struggle launched by the people of all strata in Japan, have successfully foiled Eisenhower's conspiracy to 'visit' Japan and the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to forcibly 'pass' the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Councillors, demonstrating the awakening of the Japanese people and the further isolation of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

"On June 19th, amidst the unanimous protests of the entire country, the Kishi Nobusuke government brazenly announced that the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty had been 'naturally established.' This is a robber-like self-proclamation and merely a last-ditch struggle of the Kishi Nobusuke clique after suffering a series of heavy blows. The Japanese workers and people will never approve this Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that betrays the interests of the Japanese nation and endangers peace in Asia and the world.

"The fourth general strike will be combined with students' strikes, merchants' market strikes, and the struggles of other sectors, converging into another unprecedented nationwide high tide of struggle in Japan. We are confident that the Japanese workers, who have undergone profound training, will, as long as they persist in unity and make unremitting efforts, be able to turn the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' 'approved' new 'Japan-U.S. Security Treaty' into ashes with the flames of the broad masses' struggle. We wish the fourth national general strike even more brilliant victory."

    日本人民永远不会批准日美条约
    我全总致电祝日本第四次总罢工取得更大胜利
    新华社21日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电日本工会总评议会，表示坚决支持日本工人为迫使岸信介政府下台、解散国会和粉碎日美军事同盟条约而举行的第四次全国总罢工，并向英雄的日本工人再一次致以最崇高的敬意。
    电报说，“6月4日和15日接连举行的两次总罢工和日本全国各阶层人民一起展开的雷霆万钧、气势磅礴的斗争，成功地挫败了艾森豪威尔‘访问’日本的阴谋计划，挫败了岸信介政府在参议院强行‘通过’日美军事同盟条约的阴谋计划，表示出日本人民的觉醒和美日反动派的更加孤立。
    “6月19日，岸信介政府在举国一致的抗议声中，悍然宣布日美军事同盟条约已经‘自然成立’，这是强盗式的自封成立、这只是岸信介集团在遭受一连串沉重打击后的垂死挣扎。日本工人和人民是永远不会批准这一出卖日本民族利益、危害亚洲及世界和平的日美军事同盟条约的。
    “第四次总罢工将和学生的罢课、商人的罢市以及其他各界人士的斗争结合起来，汇合成日本空前的全民性规模的又一个斗争高潮。我们确信，经受了深刻锻炼的日本工人，只要坚持团结，不懈地作出努力，一定能够用广大人民斗争的火焰，把美日反动派‘批准’的新‘日美安全条约’化为灰烬。祝第四次全国总罢工取得更加光辉的胜利。”
