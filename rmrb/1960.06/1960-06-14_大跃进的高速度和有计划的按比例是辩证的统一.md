The Great Leap Forward in China's national economy in 1958 and 1959 proved an important truth: the high-speed development of the national economy and planned, proportional development are entirely unified. This unquestionable truth fills the Chinese people with boundless confidence in the continued leap forward in the development of the national economy.

The development of the national economy, like the development of other things, follows the dialectical law of balance – imbalance – balance. The national economy experiences imbalance in its development, achieves balance through regulation, and then imbalance reappears. In capitalist society, due to the inherent contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production, social production is in a state of anarchy, and the necessary balance and proportional relationships between the various sectors of the national economy in a given period can only be adjusted through economic crises and the destruction of productive forces. In socialist society, socialist public ownership of the means of production fundamentally eliminates the anarchy of production, providing for the first time in the history of social production a full possibility for the planned, proportional development of the national economy. Turning this possibility into reality is the task of economic work in socialist countries.

The characteristic of a socialist economy is that it not only demands but also makes it fully possible to realize the high-speed development of the national economy at a rate unprecedented in history. The rate of development of productive forces in the capitalist era is much faster than in the feudal era. The development of production technology in the past two hundred years of capitalism is a great leap forward compared to the development in feudalism over a thousand years or even thousands of years. The rate of development of productive forces under the socialist system is much faster than under capitalism. The development of the socialist system in the forty-plus years since its birth on Earth is a greater leap forward than the development of capitalism in more than two hundred years. This is because the socialist system fundamentally eliminates exploitation and class antagonism, and laborers become the masters of production, opening up infinitely broad space for the high-speed development of productive forces. Therefore, its superiority is incomparable to any social system in history. Precisely because of this, the high-speed development of the national economy is an objective law of the socialist economy. In socialist construction, we should and can strive to advance at a speed that is not just somewhat higher than capitalism, but much higher.

High speed and proportionality are a dialectical unity in socialist construction. If the national economy is not proportional, there can be no high-speed development. And high speed will inevitably promote a more coordinated proportional relationship among the various sectors of the national economy. This is the identity of the contradictory aspects of high speed and proportionality in socialist economic construction. The issue of high speed is the most important issue in socialist construction. In the interrelationship between high speed and proportionality, high speed is the leading aspect of the contradiction. Taking the realization of high speed as the guiding ideology and seeking correct proportional relationships that guarantee high-speed development in the national economy is a major task of socialist economic construction.

Why is the issue of speed the most important issue in socialist construction? Why should we strive for high speed? Looking at our country's internal and external situation, it is necessary to strive for high speed, and it is also fully possible to achieve high speed. Our country is a large country with backward economy and culture. The task history has given us is to eliminate this backwardness in the shortest possible time and build a modern socialist power. From the perspective of the international situation, the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism are still constantly trying to bully us. The United States still occupies our Taiwan and is still constantly coveting and threatening our country. We must accelerate the pace of construction to make our country stronger and more prosperous. And the increasing strength of China can greatly strengthen the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and accelerate the process of the complete victory of socialism over capitalism. Therefore, striving for high speed is not just a matter of rapidly changing the face of our country, but also has significant international implications. And this necessity is linked to possibility. We have the construction line and construction policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong based on the objective laws of socialist economic development in our country; we have the great strength and collective wisdom of 650 million hardworking and courageous people; we have various kinds of rich resources; and we have the support of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The key is how to give full play to the role of these favorable conditions. If the construction speed targets we propose are higher than capitalism, but only generally high speed, then the potential will not be fully utilized, and the process of building a modern socialist power will be longer. If we propose the goal of the high speed of the Great Leap Forward, we can use a key that can open the treasure trove of the people's massive enthusiasm and creativity, and give the fullest play to the great wisdom and infinite power hidden in the people, so that we can achieve our great ideals in a relatively short period of time. These views, which we stated two years ago, have been proven to be completely correct by the facts of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years.

The Party's general line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies reflect the laws of socialist economic development in our country, and reflect the dialectical unity between the high speed of the Great Leap Forward and planned proportionality. Implementing the general line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies can turn the possibility of high-speed and proportional development of the national economy into reality. This is because the simultaneous promotion of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous promotion of heavy industry and light industry, the simultaneous promotion of central industry and local industry, the simultaneous promotion of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and the simultaneous promotion of foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production all guarantee that the national economy can develop at both high speed and proportionally. The proportional relationships in the national economy have two aspects, basic and non-basic. Whether the development of the national economy is coordinated mainly depends on whether the basic proportional relationships are appropriate. The basic proportional relationships of the national economy are the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, and the proportional relationship between heavy industry and light industry. If these two proportional relationships are arranged well, they can drive the corresponding arrangement of other proportional relationships. If agriculture also has high-speed development at the same time as the high-speed development of industry, then agriculture may be able to provide more raw materials for light industry, promote faster development of light industry, and provide a broad market for the rapid development of heavy industry, creating favorable conditions for the proportional development of heavy industry and light industry. Under the condition that the basic proportional relationships are coordinated, even if there are some uncoordinated non-basic proportional relationships (which are inevitable in many cases), as long as we start from the development of production and adopt a policy of active balance to adjust them, they will be quickly resolved, ensuring the continued leap forward of the national economy. The policy stipulated by the Party Central Committee of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and implementing the simultaneous promotion of industry and agriculture under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, made the proportional relationships between industry and agriculture, as well as the proportional relationships between heavy industry and light industry, in the national economy of our country in 1958 and 1959 coordinated in the high-speed development of the Great Leap Forward. Because these basic proportional relationships are coordinated, the proportional relationships of the entire national economy have also been coordinated in the leap forward, so there has been a continuous and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the entire national economy. It is impossible to imagine that the proportional relationships of the national economy are uncoordinated, and that a high-speed Great Leap Forward can be achieved for two consecutive years.

Some people once worried or suspected that high speed might destroy proportional relationships. This worry and suspicion did not see the essence of the problem. As mentioned above, high speed and proportionality are objective laws of socialist economic development. Whether the proportional relationships of the national economy will be destroyed depends on whether the speed stipulated when we formulate the plan has a reliable basis, and whether it is established on the basis of the unity of objective conditions and subjective conditions. High speed that conforms to objective conditions and subjective conditions will not only not destroy proportional relationships, but will also make proportional relationships more coordinated. If the speed stipulated in the plan does not conform to objective conditions and subjective conditions, and the speed is set too high or too low, it will destroy proportional relationships and make the proportional relationships uncoordinated.

The socialist national economy must develop in a planned and proportional manner, but the proportional relationships are not fixed and immutable. It is a metaphysical view to regard proportional relationships as unchangeable and to think that they can be solved once and for all. In the process of development of the socialist national economy, the actual proportional relationships are constantly changing. The task of economic leadership is to constantly discover and timely adjust these proportional relationships. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Our country makes an economic plan once a year, arranging appropriate proportions for accumulation and consumption, and seeking a balance between production and needs. The so-called balance is a temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After a year, generally speaking, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, this unity changes, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes disunity, and we need to make the balance and unity of the second year. This is the superiority of our planned economy. In fact, every month and every quarter, this balance and unity are partially broken, and local adjustments need to be made. Sometimes, because the subjective arrangements do not conform to objective conditions, contradictions occur and balance is destroyed, which is called making mistakes. Contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved, which is the dialectical law of the development of things." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The fact is exactly like this. In the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, there have been some individual and local imbalances, and we have constantly adjusted them and constantly established new balances. For example, transportation cannot keep up with the needs of production and construction, which is a more prominent imbalance in the Great Leap Forward. So we strengthened transportation work to seek a balance between production and transportation. On the basis of reaching a temporary relative balance, industry and agriculture have greatly developed again, and new imbalances have appeared between production and transportation, so we have worked hard to establish a new balance. In this cycle, the national economy is constantly developing forward in a wave-like movement. This movement shows that high speed and proportionality are a unity of contradictions, a dialectical unity. Our task is to grasp this dialectical law of economic development, adopt a policy of active balance, and in the process of high-speed development, constantly adjust proportional relationships according to specific conditions, and constantly establish new proportional relationships, so that the wheel of socialist construction can continue to advance at high speed. We should not adopt a policy of passive balance, letting speed accommodate a certain framework of proportionality that is considered fixed and immutable, because that can only lead to a slow and stagnant situation, which is very detrimental to socialist construction.

Whether the socialist national economy can achieve high speed and proportionality depends on whether the economic work conforms to objective economic laws. People cannot arbitrarily change objective laws with their subjective wishes, cannot subjectively think that there can be as high a speed as they want, and cannot think that there can be whatever proportional relationships they want. However, on the other hand, since people are the most active factor of productive forces and have the possibility of understanding, mastering, and applying objective economic laws, people are not powerless in the face of objective laws. According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, people who know, master, and apply objective laws can give full play to their subjective initiative, and can maximize the reaction to the objective and realize the leap of productive forces. The view that people are powerless in the face of economic laws is a viewpoint of mechanical materialism. Of course, there must be a process to understand, master, and apply the laws of high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. It is also a metaphysical view to think that it can be found all at once, and that various proportional relationships can be arranged well in one go. This is not only because objective laws can only be gradually understood and mastered, but also because things are always in the process of continuous development, and when a contradiction is resolved, new contradictions appear. People's understanding cannot reach the sky in one step, but can only gradually approach the truth and master the truth in the process of practice, through the comparison of successes and failures, and through tortuous development. Whether or not high speed and proportionality can be achieved depends not only on objective material and technical conditions, but also on subjective conditions, and on people's political and ideological state. Under certain material and technical conditions, whether socialist construction is fast, good, economical, or slow, poor, and wasteful, people's political and ideological state plays a decisive role. And material conditions are also created by people, and can be improved by relying on people's efforts. Without sufficient energy, without striving for the upstream, without putting politics in command, and without launching mass movements in all departments, there will be no unity of high speed and proportionality, which is also very obvious.

It should be emphasized that in order to ensure the Great Leap Forward of the socialist national economy with high speed and planned proportional development, it is necessary to solve the contradictions between the productive relations and the productive forces, and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base in a timely and correct manner. Only the continuous revolution of the productive relations and the superstructure can continuously open up broad roads for the high-speed development of socialist productive forces. And this is linked to the subjective initiative of people. Under the socialist system, the continuous liberation of the people in the economic, political, ideological, technical, and cultural fields will enable them to better understand, master, and apply objective laws, and to give fuller play to their subjective initiative. The fact that the national economy of our country has achieved a Great Leap Forward for two consecutive years vividly illustrates this truth. The proposal of our Party's general line for socialist construction has opened up a new stage in socialist construction in our country. Based on the principle of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stage of revolutionary development of Marxism-Leninism, which was creatively developed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we have continuously resolved the contradictions between the productive relations and the productive forces, as well as the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base, thereby realizing and continuing to realize the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy. The people's commune movement in rural and urban areas, the continuous revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the struggle against right-leaning opportunism, a series of reforms in management systems, rules and regulations, labor relations, leadership methods, etc., all these reforms in the productive relations and the superstructure have further and more fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and promoted the development of productive forces. The inevitability of the high speed and planned proportional development of the Great Leap Forward of our country's national economy, its secret lies here.

The Great Leap Forward for two consecutive years has given us relatively rich experience. By fully utilizing these experiences, and summing up new experiences in new practices, our socialist construction can ride the wind and waves and continue to develop forward at high speed. The Party's general line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, coupled with the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, are the fundamental guarantees for the national economy to have both the high speed of the Great Leap Forward and planned proportional development. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's creative development of Marxism-Leninism. Holding high the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuing to adhere to the general line, adhering to the Great Leap Forward, and adhering to the people's commune, we will surely be able to maintain the unified leap forward situation of the high speed and planned proportionality of the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1960 and for a considerable period in the future.

### 大跃进的高速度和有计划的按比例是辩证的统一

    大跃进的高速度和有计划的按比例是辩证的统一
    我国国民经济在1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，证明了一个重要的真理：国民经济的高速度发展和有计划按比例发展是完全可以统一的。这个无可置疑的真理，使我国人民对国民经济继续跃进的发展前程，更加充满无限的信心。
    国民经济的发展，如同其他事物的发展一样，是按照平衡——不平衡——平衡这个辩证规律进行的。国民经济在发展中出现了不平衡，经过调节实现平衡，而后又出现不平衡。在资本主义社会里，由于生产社会性和生产资料私人占有的固有矛盾，社会生产处于无政府状态，只能通过经济危机、通过生产力的破坏来调整国民经济各部门相互之间在一定时期所必需保持的平衡和一定的比例关系。在社会主义社会，社会主义的生产资料公有制从根本上排除了生产的无政府状态，在社会生产历史上第一次提供了国民经济有计划、按比例发展的充分可能性。把这种可能性变为现实，是社会主义国家的经济工作的任务。
    社会主义经济的特点，不但要求而且也完全可能实现国民经济以历史上所没有的高速度发展。资本主义时代生产力的发展速度比起封建主义时代要快得多。资本主义在过去两百多年中在生产技术方面的发展，比起封建主义一千多年以至几千年中的发展是一个很大的跃进。社会主义制度下生产力的发展速度比起资本主义更快得多。社会主义制度在地球上诞生四十多年来的发展，比起资本主义两百多年的发展是一个更大的跃进。这是因为社会主义制度从根本上消灭了剥削、消灭了阶级的对立，劳动者成了生产的主人，为生产力的高速度发展开辟了无限广阔的天地，因而它的优越性是历史上任何社会制度所无法比拟的。正因为这样，国民经济的高速度发展，是社会主义经济的客观规律。在社会主义建设中，应当而且可能争取用比资本主义不是高一些而是要高得很多的速度前进。
    高速度和按比例在社会主义建设中是辩证的统一。国民经济如果不是按比例的，就不可能有高速度的发展。而高速度又必然促进国民经济各部门比例关系的更加协调。这就是社会主义经济建设中高速度和按比例这两个矛盾方面的同一性。高速度问题是社会主义建设中的最重要的问题。在高速度和按比例的相互关系中，高速度是矛盾的主导方面。把实现高速度作为指导思想，在国民经济中寻求保证高速度发展的正确的比例关系，这是社会主义经济建设的一项重大任务。
    为什么说速度问题是社会主义建设中最重要的问题呢？为什么要力争高速度呢？从我们国家的内外形势来看，有必要力争高速度，也有充分可能实现高速度。我国是一个经济文化落后的大国，历史赋与我们的任务是用尽可能短的时间消除这种落后，建设成一个现代化的社会主义强国。从国际形势来看，以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力，还时刻企图欺侮我们。美国还占领着我国的台湾，仍然时刻在觊觎和威胁着我们的国家。我们必须加快建设的速度，使我国更快地强盛起来。而中国的日益强盛，又可以大大壮大以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，加速社会主义完全战胜资本主义的过程。因此，力争高速度不仅仅是一个迅速改变我们国家面貌的问题，而且具有重大的国际意义。而这种必要性又是和可能性联系在一起的。我们有党中央和毛泽东同志根据我国社会主义经济发展的客观规律而制订的建设路线和建设方针；有六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的人民的伟大力量和集体智慧；有各种各样的丰富资源；又有以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的支援。问题的关键在于我们如何充分发挥这些有利条件的作用。如果我们提出的建设速度的目标虽然高于资本主义，但只是一般的高速度，那末潜力就得不到充分发挥，建设一个现代化的社会主义强国的过程就要长一些。如果我们提出的目标是大跃进的高速度，我们就可以用一把能够打开人民群众的巨大的积极性和创造性的宝库的钥匙，把潜藏在人民群众中的伟大的智慧和无穷的力量，最充分地发挥出来，使我们在比较短的时间内，实现我们伟大的理想。这些我们在两年以前就已陈述过的观点，已经被两年来的大跃进的事实证明是完全正确的。
    党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“同时并举”的方针，反映了我国社会主义经济发展的规律，反映了大跃进的高速度和有计划的按比例的辩证统一的关系。贯彻执行总路线和一套“同时并举”的方针，就可以把国民经济的高速度和按比例的发展的可能性变为现实。因为工业和农业的同时并举，重工业和轻工业的同时并举，中央工业和地方工业的同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业的同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产的同时并举，都是保证国民经济既能高速度、又能按比例地发展。国民经济中的比例关系，有基本的和非基本的两个方面。国民经济的发展是否协调，主要是看基本的比例关系是否合适。国民经济的基本比例关系，就是工业和农业的比例关系，重工业和轻工业的比例关系。这两个比例关系安排得好，就可以带动其它的比例关系得到相适应的安排。在工业高速度发展的同时，农业也有高速度的发展，那末农业就有可能为轻工业提供更多的原料，促进轻工业有更快的发展，并且为重工业的迅速发展提供广阔的市场，为重工业和轻工业按比例发展创造有利条件。在基本的比例关系协调的情况下，非基本的比例关系即使出现某些不协调（这在许多情况下是不可避免的），只要我们从发展生产出发，采取积极平衡的方针加以调整，就会很快得到解决，保证国民经济的持续跃进。党中央规定的以农业为基础，以工业为主导，在优先发展重工业的条件下实行工农业同时并举的方针，使得我国1958和1959年的国民经济在大跃进的高速度的发展中，不论是工业和农业的比例关系，还是重工业和轻工业的比例关系，都是协调的。由于这些基本比例关系是协调的，整个国民经济的比例关系也就在跃进中获得了协调，所以才有整个国民经济持续的全面的大跃进。不可能设想，国民经济的比例关系不协调，而能够连续两年实现高速度的大跃进。
    曾经有人担心或者怀疑，高速度可能破坏比例关系，这种担心和怀疑是没有看到问题的实质。上面已经说过，高速度和按比例是社会主义经济发展的客观规律。国民经济的比例关系会不会破坏，决定于我们制订计划时所规定的速度是否有可靠的根据，是否建立在客观条件和主观条件相统一的基础之上。合乎客观条件和主观条件的高速度，不但不会破坏比例关系，而且会使比例关系更加协调。如果计划所规定的速度不合乎客观条件和主观条件，速度订得很高或很低，都会破坏比例关系，使比例关系不相协调。
    社会主义国民经济必须有计划按比例发展，但是比例关系并不是固定不变的。把比例关系看作一成不变，以为可以一劳永逸地加以解决，是一种形而上学的观点。在社会主义国民经济发展过程中，实际的比例关系是经常变动的。经济领导工作的任务就在于经常地发现和及时地调整这些比例关系。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“我国每年作一次经济计划，安排积累和消费的适当比例，求得生产和需要之间的平衡。所谓平衡就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一。这就是我们计划经济的优越性。事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整。有时因为主观安排不符合客观情况，发生矛盾，破坏平衡，这就叫做犯错误。矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）事实正是这样，在过去两年的大跃进中，曾经出现某些个别的、局部的不平衡，我们不断地加以调整，不断地建立新的平衡。比如，运输赶不上生产建设的需要，这是大跃进中出现的比较突出的不平衡。于是我们就加强运输工作，求得生产和运输的平衡。在达到暂时的相对的平衡的基础上，工农业又向前大大发展了，生产和运输又出现新的不平衡，于是我们又努力去建立新的平衡。如此循环往复，国民经济在波浪式运动中不断地向前发展。这种运动表明了高速度和按比例是矛盾的统一，是辩证的统一。我们的任务在于掌握这种经济发展的辩证规律，采取积极平衡的方针，在高速度发展过程中，根据具体情况，不断地调整比例关系，不断地建立新的比例关系，使社会主义建设的车轮不断地高速前进。我们不应当采取消极平衡的方针，让速度来迁就某种被认为是固定不变的比例框框，因为那样就只能出现缓慢的停滞的局面，这对于社会主义建设是十分不利的。
    社会主义国民经济能不能高速度和能不能按比例，这一方面要看经济工作是否符合客观的经济规律。人们不能随心所欲地以自己的主观愿望改变客观规律，不能主观主义地想有多高的速度就有多高的速度，不能想有怎样的比例关系就可以有怎样的比例关系。但是，另一方面，人既是生产力的最积极的因素，又有可能认识、掌握和运用客观的经济规律，所以人在客观规律面前，并不是无能为力的。按照辩证唯物主义的观点，认识和掌握了客观规律的人，可以充分发挥主观的能动性，能够最大限度地反作用于客观，实现生产力的飞跃。那种认为人在经济规律面前无能为力的看法是机械唯物论的观点。当然，要认识、掌握和运用国民经济高速度、按比例发展的规律，必须有一个过程。以为一下就可以找到它，一次就能安排好各种比例关系，也是一种形而上学的观点。这不仅因为客观规律只能逐步认识和掌握，而且因为事物总是在不断发展的过程中，解决了一个矛盾，又有新的矛盾出现。人们的认识不能一步登天，而只能在实践过程中，经过成功的和失败的比较，经过曲折的发展，逐渐接近真理，掌握真理。能不能高速度和按比例，并不仅仅取决于客观的物质技术条件，同时也取决于主观的条件，取决于人们的政治思想状况。在一定的物质技术条件下，社会主义建设是多快好省还是少慢差费，人们的政治思想状况起着决定性的作用。而且物质条件也是人所创造的，是能够依靠人的努力来加以改进的。不鼓足干劲，不力争上游，不政治挂帅，不在一切部门大搞群众运动，就不会有高速度和按比例的统一，这也是很显然的。
    应当强调指出的是，为了保证社会主义国民经济的大跃进的高速度和有计划的按比例的发展，必须适时地正确地解决生产关系和生产力的矛盾、上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾。只有生产关系和上层建筑的不断革命，才能不断为社会主义生产力的高速度发展开辟宽广的道路。而这又是同人的主观能动作用联系在一起的。在社会主义制度下，人民群众在经济上、政治上、思想上、技术上、文化上的不断解放，也就更加能够认识、掌握和运用客观规律，更加充分地发挥主观能动作用。我国国民经济连续两年的大跃进的事实，生动地说明了这个道理。我们党的社会主义建设总路线的提出，开创了我国社会主义建设的新阶段。我们根据毛泽东同志所创造性地发展的马克思列宁主义不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，不断地解决生产关系和生产力的矛盾以及上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，从而实现了并继续实现着国民经济的持续的大跃进。农村中和城市中的人民公社运动，政治战线和思想战线上的不断革命，反对右倾机会主义的斗争，管理体制、规章制度、劳动关系、领导方法等等一系列的改革，所有这些生产关系和上层建筑的改革，都进一步地更加充分地调动了人民群众的积极性和创造性，促进了生产力的发展。我国国民经济的大跃进的高速度和有计划的按比例的发展的必然性，其奥妙也正在这里。
    连续两年的大跃进，使我们取得了比较丰富的经验。充分运用这些经验，并且在新的实践中总结新的经验，我们的社会主义建设，就能乘风破浪，继续高速度地向前发展。党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“同时并举”的方针，再加上技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，是国民经济既能有大跃进的高速度又能有有计划按比例的发展的根本保证。这是毛泽东同志对于马克思列宁主义的创造性的发展。高举毛泽东思想的光辉旗帜，继续坚持总路线、坚持大跃进、坚持人民公社，我们就一定能在1960年和今后相当长的时期中保持国民经济大跃进的高速度和有计划按比例的统一的跃进局面。
