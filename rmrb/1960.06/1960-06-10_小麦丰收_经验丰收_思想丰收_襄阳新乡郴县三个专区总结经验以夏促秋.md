Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. The Xiangyang Special Zone in Hubei Province, which achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year, is using its summer bumper harvest experience to promote autumn crop production. Both summer planting and early autumn crop field management are being carried out vigorously and solidly. As of the 3rd, more than half of the zone's summer planting plan has been completed, and early autumn crops have generally been weeded twice and treated for pests once.

This year, the summer harvest area in Xiangyang Special Zone expanded by more than 2 million mu compared to last year, and both wheat, barley, and beans have achieved bumper harvests.

All parts of the Xiangyang Special Zone generally organized the masses to use on-site discussions and typical comparisons during the summer harvest to conduct a preliminary summary of bumper harvest experiences. The main key to this year's summer harvest bumper harvest was good planting, which the masses call "thick foundation" and "rich from the womb." Based on this experience, all localities have adopted the method of large-scale assault and large-scale collaboration this year to strive for timely planting and good planting of autumn harvest crops. At present, 2 million laborers and 250,000 yokes of cattle are invested in summer planting, a scale larger than any previous year. In the past, the average base fertilizer for rice was about 50 to 60 dan per mu, but this year it has generally increased to around 100 dan.

Multiple planting and multiple harvesting is another important experience of the summer harvest in Xiangyang Special Zone. Based on this experience, people are trying every means to expand the summer planting area. Suixian County has planted nearly 200,000 mu more miscellaneous grains this year than last year. Many areas also make full use of barren mountains, barren ditches, and barren depressions to grow pumpkins on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100 million pumpkin seedlings have been planted in the zone, averaging about 30 seedlings per person.

All localities have also built various crop high-yield experimental fields in summer planting based on the experience of running experimental fields in the summer harvest. According to statistics, more than 600,000 cadres and commune members in the zone participated in high-yield experiments, and more than 20,000 high-yield fields, high-yield ridges, and high-yield squares have been built, covering more than 300,000 mu, greatly promoting the zone's high-yield competition movement.

This newspaper reports that recently, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Henan Province organized secretaries of municipal and county party committees and technicians to summarize wheat bumper harvest experience on-site with the masses to promote autumn production.

This year, more than 12 million mu of wheat in the northern Henan area generally achieved a bumper harvest. The obvious feature is a balanced increase in production over a large area. The wheat grew strong plants with large ears, high stalks with dense stalks, and large, full grains, surpassing previous years. They summarized the basic experiences of various places in obtaining a bumper wheat harvest as: adhering to putting politics in command, strengthening the leadership of the Party, fully exerting people's subjective initiative, adhering to the drought resistance struggle, and finally overcoming the great drought of more than 200 days. More than 2 million mu of mountainous hills have drilled 26,000 mechanized wells in the fight against drought and established more than 1,000 mechanized irrigation stations. In addition to extensive digging of mountain springs, high mountain water conservancy was exchanged from drought resistance, and a bumper wheat harvest was also won for the first time.

This year, the entire region established more than 3.31 million mu of high-yield squares in plains, hills, saline-alkali, and low-lying areas. Experimental farms, technology stations, meteorological stations, cultural stations, pig farms, fertilizer plants, and tool repair plants were established in the high-yield squares, effectively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase and laying the foundation for agricultural modernization. The high-yield squares led the general fields, competing with each other, so that the general fields achieved a bumper harvest.

While developing high-yield squares on a large scale, all counties in the region reclaimed wasteland and expanded wheat fields by 2.17 million mu. This year, not only was the yield per mu greatly improved for wheat, but the total output was also greatly improved.

Extensively establishing and improving agricultural scientific research institutions, establishing small farms, technical guidance groups, archives management offices, etc., combining soaring energy with scientific analysis, mastering the characteristics and laws of wheat growth, accurately and effectively overcoming drought, frost, and insect pests, and initially mastering the laws of high-yield wheat without lodging.

Through summarizing, people's thinking has been further liberated, and the erroneous idea of production reaching its peak has been overcome. On the basis of summarizing the experience of a bumper wheat harvest, all localities have also formulated plans to strive for a bumper autumn harvest and plans to strive for an even greater bumper wheat harvest in 1961 in the spirit of continuous revolution, and have quickly applied the experience of increasing wheat production to striving for a bumper autumn harvest. At present, in the spirit of planting enough and planting well, all localities are further expanding the area of wasteland reclamation by 1 million mu; the area of autumn field high-yield squares will be expanded to 40%, and various production increase measures must also be followed up in a timely manner.

This newspaper reports that the Chen County Special Zone in Hunan Province has mobilized the vast number of cadres and commune members to conscientiously summarize the experience of increasing wheat production to prepare for expanding wheat planting this winter.

The Chenzhou area is a rice-producing area and has historically rarely grown wheat. The 350,000 mu of wheat harvested this year generally yielded more than last year. Through mass summarization, the vast number of cadres and masses unanimously believe that to make wheat high-yielding in this area, it is necessary to break through the seven barriers of deep plowing, fertilizer, fine seeds, season, rational close planting, field management, and timely harvesting from sowing to harvest. In particular, the season barrier, field management barrier, and timely harvesting barrier are even more important.

This area is located north of the Five Ridges and has a higher temperature. Early sowing of wheat will cause the wheat seedlings to grow excessively and be prone to frost damage; late sowing will reduce tillering and reduce yield. According to local experience, it is advisable to use the "Zhongda 2059" fine seed to sow after the "Autumn Equinox" near the "Cold Dew"; it is advisable to use the "Nanda 2419" fine seed to sow after the "Cold Dew" near the "Frost's Descent".

There is more rainy weather between spring and summer here, and insect pests are also prone to occur, especially near the harvest season, continuous rainy weather often causes the wheat about to be harvested to suffer serious losses such as mildew. The masses have never been accustomed to planting wheat, and treat wheat field management with the attitude of "harvest if there is any, discard if there is none," which is also an important reason for the low wheat yield in the past.

Before the wheat harvest this year, this area carried out a three-attack (stalk, ear, grain) and three-defense (water, birds and beasts, mildew) campaign; when the wheat matured, the wheat fields were lined up mound by mound, so that one mound was harvested when it was ripe, harvested carefully, and methods such as sun-drying, cooling, carting, and baking were adopted to overcome the plum rain and obtain a bumper harvest.

Through summarizing the experience of increasing wheat production and carrying out mass self-education, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for expanding wheat planting this winter has been greatly mobilized. According to preliminary plans in various places, 1 million mu of wheat will be expanded this winter, an increase of 1.8 times compared to last year.

At present, various places are carrying out seed selection and seed retention work.

    小麦丰收　经验丰收　思想丰收
    襄阳新乡郴县三个专区总结经验以夏促秋
    据新华社武汉电　夺得今年小麦丰收的湖北省襄阳专区，运用夏季丰产经验，促进秋季作物生产，不论夏种和早秋作物田间管理，都搞得轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实。到3日止，全区夏种计划已完成一半以上，早秋作物普遍锄了两遍草、治了一遍虫。
    今年襄阳专区的夏收面积比去年扩大二百多万亩，无论小麦、大麦、豆类，都获得了丰收。
    襄阳专区各地普遍在夏收时组织群众用现场讨论和典型对比等办法，对丰产经验进行了初步总结。今年夏收丰收的主要关键是种得好，群众叫做“底子厚”、“胎里富”。根据这个经验，各地今年都采取大突击、大协作的办法，力争秋收作物适时播种、种好。目前，全区有二百万劳力、二十五万犋耕牛投入夏种，规模大过以往任何一年。往年，水稻底肥平均每亩约五、六十担，今年已普遍增加到百担上下。
    多种多收是襄阳专区夏季丰收的另一项重要经验。根据这一经验，人们千方百计地扩大夏种面积。随县今年已种的杂粮比去年扩大了近二十万亩。许多地区还充分利用荒山、荒沟、荒洼大种南瓜。据不完全统计，目前全区已种南瓜一亿多万窝，平均每人约有三十窝。
    各地还根据夏季丰收办试验田的经验，在夏种中大办各种作物丰产试验田。据统计，全区参加丰产试验的干部和社员达六十多万人，已经建起的丰产畈、丰产岗、丰产方达两万多处、三十多万亩，大大推动了全区的丰产竞赛运动。
    本报讯　最近，中共河南新乡地委组织各市、县委书记和技术员同群众一起在现场总结小麦丰产经验，促进秋季生产。
    今年豫北地区一千二百多万亩麦子普遍获得丰收。显明的特点是大面积平衡增产，麦子长的株壮穗大，秆高棵密，籽大粒饱，胜过往年。他们总结各地获得小麦丰收的基本经验是：坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，充分发挥了人的主观能动性，坚持抗旱斗争，终于战胜了二百多天的大旱。二百余万亩的山地丘岭，在抗旱中打了两万六千眼机井，建立了千余处机灌站，加上广泛挖山泉，从抗旱中换来了高山水利化，也破天荒地夺得了小麦丰收。
    今年全区在平地、丘陵、盐碱、低洼等地建立了三百三十一万多亩丰产方，在丰产方里建立了试验场、技术站、气象站、文化站、养猪场、肥料厂、工具修配厂，有效地执行了农业增产“八字宪法”，为农业现代化打下了基础。以丰产方带一般田，互相竞赛，使一般田获得了丰收。
    全区各县在大搞丰产方的同时，又开荒扩大了麦田二百一十七万亩。今年小麦不仅单产有很大提高，总产也同样有很大提高。
    广泛地建立健全农业科学研究机构，建立小农场、技术辅导团、档案管理室等，把冲天干劲与科学分析结合起来，掌握小麦生长的特点和规律，准确有力地战胜了旱灾、霜灾、虫灾，并初步掌握了小麦高产不倒伏的规律。
    通过总结进一步解放了人们的思想，克服了生产到顶的错误思想。在总结小麦丰收经验的基础上，各地还以不断革命的精神制订了争取秋季大丰收的计划，和争取1961年小麦更大丰收的规划，把小麦增产经验，迅速运用到争取秋季大丰收上来。目前，各地本着种足种好的精神，再扩大开荒面积一百万亩；秋田丰产方的面积将要扩大到40％，各种增产措施也都要及时跟上去。
    本报讯　湖南郴县专区发动广大干部和社员认真总结小麦增产经验，为今冬扩种小麦作好准备。
    郴州地区是水稻产区，历来很少种植小麦。今年收获的三十五万多亩小麦普遍比去年增产。通过群众性的总结，广大干部和群众一致认为，要使小麦在这个地区高产，从播种到收获，必须攻破深耕、肥料、良种、季节、合理密植、田间管理和适时收割七个关。特别是季节关、田间管理关、适时收割关更为重要。
    这个地区在五岭以北，气温较高。小麦播种过早，会造成麦苗徒长，易遭冻害；播种迟了，会减少分蘖，降低产量。根据当地经验，采用“中大二○五九”良种，在“秋分”后“寒露”边播种为宜；采用“南大二四一九”良种，在“寒露”后“霜降”边播种为宜。
    这里春夏之间阴雨天气较多，也易发生虫害，特别是将近收割季节，往往因连续阴雨，使即将到手的小麦也受到霉烂等严重损失。历来群众不习惯种植小麦，用“有就收、无就丢”的态度对待小麦田间管理，这也是过去小麦低产的一个重要原因。
    今年这个地区在小麦收割之前，开展了三攻（秆、穗、粒）、三防（水、鸟兽虫害、霉烂）运动；当麦子成熟时，对麦田进行逐丘排队，作到熟一丘，收一丘，细打细收，和采取晒、凉、车、烘等办法，战胜了梅雨，获得了丰收。
    通过总结小麦增产经验，进行群众性的自我教育，大大地调动了广大社员对今冬扩种小麦的积极性。据各地初步规划，今冬要扩种小麦一百万亩，比去年增加一点八倍。
    现在，各地正在进行选种和留种工作。
