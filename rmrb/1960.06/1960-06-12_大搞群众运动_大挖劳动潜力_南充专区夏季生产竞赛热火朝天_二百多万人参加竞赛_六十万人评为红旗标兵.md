Xinhua News Agency: Launch Mass Movements, Tap Labor Potential

Nanchong Prefecture's Summer Production Competition in Full Swing
Over Two Million People Participate in the Competition, 600,000 Awarded Red Banner Pace-setters

    This newspaper reports that Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is extensively carrying out a high-efficiency, high-quality competition movement during the summer harvest and planting season. Currently, over two million people in the region are participating in this movement, with 600,000 being selected as Red Banner pace-setters, and advanced units are continuously emerging. Truly, red flags are flourishing everywhere, and a surge of "learn, compare, catch up, help" is sweeping across the region.

    This year, Nanchong Prefecture has a large area for summer harvest and planting, with high-quality requirements for various agricultural tasks, and the seasonality is particularly strong. According to surveys, the labor demand for various agricultural tasks has increased by more than half compared to the same period last year. Therefore, vigorously carrying out a high-efficiency movement has become the key to current rural work.

    In accordance with the requirements of the summer harvest and planting, Nanchong Prefecture has listed ten labor items, including harvesting, planting, water-drawing, plowing, seedling management, transportation, threshing, cooking, and pig-raising, as competition projects in the high-efficiency, high-quality competition movement. Harvesting and planting are emphasized as the focus of competition during different periods. Various localities have formulated competition standards based on the local level of high-efficiency and high-quality, and have implemented a graded high-efficiency system. Each standard is divided into A, B, and C levels in order to attract a wider range of people to voluntarily sign up for the competition movement. The competition takes the following three forms: First, complete sets of collective agricultural tasks such as harvesting, planting, threshing, and water-drawing are organized into competition groups at the production team level, and the groups are specifically divided according to the characteristics of each process and the specialties of the members. Second, single agricultural tasks such as transporting fertilizer and grain are conducted as individual competitions within the production team, or can be divided into group competitions. Third, fixed jobs such as cooking and pig-raising have fewer units and larger differences in conditions, so competitions are conducted at the management area level among units with similar conditions.

    The competition movements in various parts of Nanchong Prefecture are closely linked to the production arrangements of each stage. Each production team, under the leadership of the commune, first makes short-term production arrangements for a five-day period, and then determines the competition items based on this arrangement, specifically formulating competition plans and mobilizing members to sign up to participate. During the competition period, each people's commune pays special attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. At the beginning of the movement, a group of high-efficiency experts and advanced tools are generally gathered to hold field competition performance meetings, and selection is carried out from bottom to top, layer by layer, and then advanced experiences and technologies are promoted from top to bottom, layer by layer. Guang'an County also gathered more than 80 high-efficiency experts from the county to perform in Xiexing Commune first, organized visits, and then selected more than ten of the most outstanding to perform in various parts of the county, and held training courses to teach advanced technologies. More than 30% of the members in the county learned these technologies, making the advanced level quickly become the general level.

    In order to lead the development of the competition movement, Nanchong Prefecture has established judging committees at all levels, headed by the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels. Each production team organizes competition judging groups to be responsible for recording, inspecting, and evaluating competition results. Various localities have generally implemented the "three checks and three announcements" system, which involves checking and announcing the number of workers at work in the morning, checking and announcing progress at noon, and checking and announcing results in the evening; they have persisted in implementing the method of one small evaluation per day and one reward every five or ten days. They have also adopted various methods to publicize the advanced deeds and experiences of high-efficiency, high-quality pace-setters, forming an atmosphere where everyone respects pace-setters and everyone strives to be a pace-setter.

    The practice of vigorously engaging in competition in Nanchong Prefecture proves that this is a good way to launch mass movements and tap labor potential. It closely combines the agricultural production assault tasks of each period with the socialist competition movement centered on high-efficiency and high-quality, making the socialist competition movement have a prominent center, clear goals, and greater organizational role and appeal; and it ensures that the completion of agricultural production tasks in each period is more strongly guaranteed. According to statistics, more than 60% of the members in the region who are rated as laborers participated in the competition. Among the 200,000 people participating in the competition in Guang'an County, 190,000 exceeded the quota. In the competition, rural technical innovation and technical revolution movements have also developed vigorously. Fengming Commune in Xichong County improved more than ten kinds of tools in the movement, promoted more than 2,400 pieces, and increased efficiency by two to eight times, saving more than 12,000 workdays in total. In the course of the competition, various localities generally made short-term arrangements and small contracted work at the management area level. Each competition group was also reorganized and regrouped to better exert the specialties of the members. Many places also adopted the "five fix" method in the competition, which involves fixing people, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing specifications and quality, and fixing plots. All of this has greatly promoted the improvement and enhancement of labor management level and the implementation of the principle of using talents according to their abilities. (Attached picture)

    大搞群众运动　大挖劳动潜力
    南充专区夏季生产竞赛热火朝天
    二百多万人参加竞赛　六十万人评为红旗标兵
    本报讯　四川省南充专区在夏收夏种中广泛开展高工效、高质量竞赛运动。目前全区有二百多万人参加了这个运动，评选出的红旗标兵达六十万人，先进单位也不断出现。真是处处红旗成林，“学、比、赶、帮”的热潮风起云涌。
    今年，南充专区夏收夏种面积大，各项农活质量要求高，季节性也特别强。据调查，各项农活需工量比去年同期增加一半以上。因此大力开展高工效运动，成为当前农村工作中的关键所在。
    按照夏收夏种的要求，南充专区在开展高工效高质量竞赛运动中，把收割、栽种、车水、犁田、管苗、运输、脱粒、炊事、喂猪等十项劳动列为竞赛项目，并以收割、栽种作为不同时期的竞赛重点。各地根据本地高工效高质量的水平，分别工种和条件制订了竞赛标准，并实行等级高工效制度，每一项标准都分为甲、乙、丙三级，以便吸引更广泛的群众自愿报名参加竞赛运动。竞赛的形式，有以下三种：一、收、种、脱粒、车水等四项成套集体农活，以生产队为单位组织竞赛小组，组内再根据各工序特点和社员专长，具体分工。二、运肥、运粮等单个活动的农活，以生产队为单位，开展个人竞赛，也可划分小组竞赛。三、炊事、养猪等固定性工种，单位少，条件相差大，以管理区为单位，开展同条件的单位赛。
    南充专区各地竞赛运动，都紧密结合各段生产安排开展的。各个生产队在公社领导下，首先作好以五天为一段的生产短安排，然后根据这一安排确定竞赛项目，具体地制订竞赛方案，发动社员报名参加。在竞赛期间，各人民公社特别注意发动群众开展技术革新和技术革命运动。运动开始时，一般都先集中一批高工效能手和先进工具，举行田间竞赛表演会，从下到上，层层进行选拔，然后从上到下，层层推广先进经验和先进技术。广安县还集中全县高工效能手八十多人首先在协兴公社表演，组织参观，然后选拔出十多名最优秀者到全县各地巡回表演，并开办训练班，传授先进技术，全县有30％以上社员学到这些技术，使先进水平迅速成为一般的水平。
    为了领导竞赛运动的开展，南充专区层层成立了评判委员会，由各级党委第一书记挂帅，各生产队组织竞赛评判小组，负责竞赛成绩的记载、检查和评定工作。各地普遍实行了早上检查和公布出工人数，中午检查和公布进度，晚上检查和公布战果的“三查、三公布”的制度；坚持实行一天一小评、五天或十天一奖励的办法。还采用多种多样办法，宣扬高工效高质量标兵的先进事迹和先进经验，形成人人尊敬标兵、人人争取作标兵的气氛。
    南充专区大搞竞赛的实践证明，这是大搞群众运动，大挖劳动潜力的一项好办法。它把各时期农业生产突击任务与以高工效高质量为中心的社会主义竞赛运动紧密结合起来，使社会主义竞赛运动中心突出、目标明确，具有更大的组织作用和号召力量；并使各时期农业生产任务的完成，得到更加强有力的保证。据统计，全区有占评级劳力总数60％以上的社员参加了竞赛。在广安县参加竞赛的二十万人中，有十九万人超过了定额。在竞赛中，农村技术革新和技术革命运动也得到蓬勃发展。西充县凤鸣公社在运动中改良工具十多种，推广了二千四百多件，分别提高工效二至八倍，共节约一万二千多个劳动日。在竞赛过程中，各地普遍以管理区为单位，首先作好短安排和小包工，各竞赛组也是重新配套编组，更好地发挥了社员专长，许多地方在竞赛中还采取了定人、定任务、定时间、定规格质量、定地段的“五定”办法，这一切，都对改善和提高劳动管理水平、贯彻因才使用原则有很大的促进作用。（附图片）
