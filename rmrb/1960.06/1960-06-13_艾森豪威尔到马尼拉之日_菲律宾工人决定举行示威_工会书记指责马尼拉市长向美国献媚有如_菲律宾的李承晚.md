Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 9th: The secretary of the Philippine National Federation of Labor Unions, Lacsina, announced on the evening of the 8th that this federation, with 400,000 members, would disregard the threats of Manila Mayor Lacson and proceed with its planned demonstration on June 14th, the day of Eisenhower's arrival in Manila. He said that "thousands of union members and students" would participate in the demonstration.

    He accused Lacson of being a "Philippine Syngman Rhee." He said, "In the ridiculous competition to be named an American puppet, some Philippine leaders are completely beside themselves."

    Lacson had announced that he had ordered the police to arrest anyone who held a demonstration. Lacsina's response to this threat was: "The mayor will have to build more prisons."

    Speaking to reporters on the evening of the 8th, Lacsina also said that when Eisenhower arrives in Manila on the 14th, members of the Philippine National Federation of Labor Unions and some university students will hold a "peaceful demonstration" at the U.S. Embassy.

    Lacsina said that the purpose of the demonstration was to demand that the United States "respect the Philippines' sovereignty over American military bases on its territory," to express "We want peace, not missiles," and to demand a resolution of the Philippines' demands regarding war damage compensation from the United States and the abolition of American trade privileges in the Philippines.

    Meanwhile, the Philippine authorities continue to issue threats in an attempt to force the Philippine National Federation of Labor Unions to cancel its planned demonstration. Perez, chairman of the Philippine House of Representatives Anti-Filipino Activities Investigation Committee, threatened on the 8th that the Anti-Filipino Activities Investigation Committee would conduct an "investigation" into some leaders of the labor union due to their "left-leaning behavior."

    艾森豪威尔到马尼拉之日  菲律宾工人决定举行示威
    工会书记指责马尼拉市长向美国献媚有如“菲律宾的李承晚”
    新华社9日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾全国工会联合会书记拉克西纳8日晚上宣布，这个拥有四十万会员的工会联合会将不顾马尼拉市长拉克森的威胁，按照原定计划在6月14日艾森豪威尔到达马尼拉时举行示威。他说，参加示威的将有“成千的工会会员和学生”。
    他指责拉克森是“菲律宾的李承晚”。他说，“在争夺美国傀儡称号的可笑的竞争中，一些菲律宾领导人完全不知所措”。
    拉克森曾经宣布，他已经命令警察逮捕任何举行示威的人。拉克西纳对这种威胁的回答是：“市长还得多造几座监狱”。
    拉克西纳8日晚上对新闻记者发表谈话时还说，当艾森豪威尔14日到达马尼拉时，菲律宾全国工会联合会的会员和一些大学生将到美国大使馆举行“和平的示威”。
    拉克西纳说，这次示威的目的是为了要求美国“尊重菲律宾对它领土上的美国军事基地的主权”并且表示“要和平、不要导弹”，并要求解决菲律宾对美国提出的关于战争损失赔偿的要求，取消美国在菲律宾的贸易特权。
    同时，菲律宾当局继续发出威胁，企图迫使菲律宾全国工会联合会取消举行示威的计划。菲律宾众议院反菲活动调查委员会主席佩雷兹8日威胁说，由于工会联合会一些负责人的“左倾表现”，已经由反菲活动调查委员会对他们进行“调查”。
