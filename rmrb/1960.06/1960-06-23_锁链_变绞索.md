"Chains" Transformed into a Garrote
Dong Feng

American imperialism always considers itself a skilled craftsman in manufacturing "chains." The purpose of the robbers in making "chains" was originally to enslave the people of the world. They establish military bases everywhere,妄想妄想妄想 hoping to use these "chains" to lock up the people, lock up the earth, and dominate the entire world. However, things always go against their wishes, and dreams are never realized. The fact is right before our eyes: those "chains" that strangle the people and strangle peace have become steel garrotes that strangle the aggressors themselves.

Please see, among the "chains" of several military bases established by the American imperialists in the world, one is the line from South Korea in Northeast Asia to Japan, Okinawa, our territory of Taiwan and Penghu, along the Philippines, South Vietnam, all the way to Turkey in the westernmost part of Asia. They妄想妄想妄想妄想 hoped to use this "chain" to lock up the great Chinese people and the entire Asian people. However, the level-12 storm of the Asian people's anti-American struggle has put the American imperialists' front line of aggression in the Far East in danger of total collapse. The anti-American storms in South Korea, Japan, Turkey, and other places have stirred up huge waves in the Pacific Ocean, impacting this tattered chain until it creaks and totters, with cracks growing larger and larger; and this steel garrote around the neck of American imperialism is being pulled tighter and tighter.

This time, Eisenhower's sinister purpose in carrying out conspiratorial activities in Asia was nothing more than to repair this "chain," but the result was just the opposite. Like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouted "Beat him!" Eisenhower was hit by stones thrown by the Filipino people, given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people, bombed by the artillery of the Chinese people, and even the people of Okinawa, who have been under the rule of American imperialism for fifteen years, rose up in heroic struggle.

Felt, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Armed Forces, said: Okinawa, now under American rule, is "an important link in the chain" that the United States uses to deal with China. If "there were no Okinawa, the entire chain would collapse."

Felt's words naturally fully exposed the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism, but this is just the ambition and dream of the American robbers. Whether American imperialism can permanently occupy Okinawa remains to be asked of the people of Okinawa Island. The great demonstration of 100,000 people in Okinawa, shouting "Yankees, go home!" and "We demand to return to our motherland!" is a powerful answer. Okinawa, this "important link in the chain," will collapse one day.

The "chains" manufactured by American imperialism cannot lock up peace-loving people. On the contrary, the people of the world will surely turn the "chains" into garrotes, strangling American imperialism and all reactionaries.

### “锁链”变绞索

    “锁链”变绞索
    东锋
    美帝国主义总以为自己是制造“锁链”的能工巧匠。强盗们制造“锁链”的目的，本来是为了奴役世界人民。他们到处建立军事基地，妄想用一条条的“锁链”锁着人民，锁着地球，独霸整个世界。但是，事与愿违，梦想总是不能实现的。事实摆在眼前，那绞杀人民、绞杀和平的“锁链”，却变成了绞杀侵略者自己的钢铁的绞索。
    请看，美帝国主义者在世界上建立的若干军事基地的“锁链”中，有一条就是从亚洲东北部的南朝鲜到日本、冲绳、我国领土台湾、澎湖，沿菲律宾、南越一直到亚洲最西部的土耳其。他们梦想着用这条“锁链”锁住伟大的中国人民，锁住整个亚洲人民。然而，亚洲人民反美斗争的十二级风暴，使得美帝国主义在远东的侵略阵线面临着整个崩溃的危险。南朝鲜、日本、土耳其等各地人民的反美风暴，在太平洋上掀起了狂涛巨浪，冲击得这条破烂的锁链吱吱作响，摇摇欲坠，裂缝越来越大；而这条套在美帝国主义脖子上的钢铁的绞索，却越拉越紧了。
    这次，艾森豪威尔到亚洲进行阴谋活动的罪恶目的，何尝不是想修补这条“锁链”，但结果却适得其反。过街老鼠，人人喊打，艾森豪威尔受了菲律宾人民的石块打，吃了日本人民的闭门羹，挨了中国人民的大炮轰，甚至就连美帝国主义统治了十五年的冲绳人民也起来进行了英勇的斗争。
    美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特说：现在在美国统治下的冲绳，是美国一节对付中国的“锁链的重要环节”，如果“没有冲绳，整个锁链就会垮台”。
    费耳特的话，自然是充分暴露了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，然而这不过是美国强盗的野心和梦想而已。美帝国主义能不能永久占领冲绳，要去问问冲绳岛的人民。冲绳人民十万人的大示威，“美国佬，滚回去！”“我们要求重归我们的祖国！”这就是强有力的回答。冲绳，这个“锁链的重要环节”总有一天是要崩溃的。
    美帝国主义制造的“锁链”，是锁不住爱好和平的人民的。相反，世界人民一定能把“锁链”变成绞索，绞死美帝国主义和一切反动派。
