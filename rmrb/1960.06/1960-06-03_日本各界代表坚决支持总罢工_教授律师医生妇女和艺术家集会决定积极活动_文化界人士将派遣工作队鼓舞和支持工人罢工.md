Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Three hundred representatives from twenty-six Japanese professor, lawyer, doctor, women, and artist groups held a meeting today, expressing their support for the general strike scheduled for June 4th by workers to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The representatives unanimously agreed at the meeting that the groups attending the meeting would actively carry out activities to prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and force the dissolution of the Diet.

Prior to this, on May 31st, representatives of more than sixty professors from Kobe University, Kobe University of Commerce, and Hyogo University of Agriculture organized the "Hyogo Prefecture Professors Association for the Defense of Peace and Democracy."

The inaugural meeting of the association issued a statement demanding the dissolution of the Diet and condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's forced "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" as a serious violation of democratic principles.

Three hundred and thirteen university professors in Hyogo Prefecture signed the statement, including Yasuzo Sakamoto, president of Kobe University of Commerce.

Those who signed the statement are scheduled to hold a demonstration with their students on June 4th.

At the same time, one hundred and fifty professors and associate professors from Gifu University held a demonstration in Gifu City on May 29th. After the demonstration, the professors held a rally in front of Gifu Station and passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the Diet and protesting the forced "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Various Japanese organizations have issued statements supporting the June 4th general strike against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The "Security Treaty Criticism Association," composed of cultural figures, issued a statement today expressing its support for the 17th National Unified Action and the June 4th general strike. The Criticism Association decided to mobilize cultural figures to distribute leaflets in front of major stations in Tokyo starting on the afternoon of the 3rd, calling on citizens to support the unified action, and to dispatch working teams starting on the evening of the 3rd to encourage and support the workers' strike.

The Lawyers Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" also issued a statement today stating that Japanese legal workers will fully support the struggle of workers and people against the new "Security Treaty." The statement pointed out that taking emergency measures such as demonstrations, protest rallies, and strikes to safeguard democracy is completely legal.

The Kansai Labor Law Research Association issued a statement on the 1st expressing support for the June 4th general strike. The statement pointed out that launching a nationwide strike to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the dissolution of the Diet is a legitimate act.

The Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Organizations, along with twenty-eight organizations from various sectors, took joint action today to distribute leaflets in Tokyo, calling on citizens to support the June 4th general strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Five Japanese university presidents and prominent professors published talks in today's "Akahata" (Red Flag newspaper), supporting the general strike to be held by Japanese workers on June 4th to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Hiroshi Suekawa, President of Ritsumeikan University, denounced the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke government in forcing the House of Representatives to "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and pointed out that the people have the right to resist acts that violate the constitution. Therefore, the Japanese people's actions of petitioning, demonstrating, and other actions to protest the fascist behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government are the people's rights.

Yasushi Tsuneto, former president of Osaka City University, pointed out that the people have the right to use political strikes to criticize the government, so this general strike is a matter of course.

Takeo Kuwabara, professor at Kyoto University, pointed out that from the standpoint of safeguarding democracy, the Kishi Nobusuke group's forced vote on the new "Security Treaty" is unacceptable, and the Japanese people's use of action to oppose it is the people's legitimate right.

Kiyonobu Asai, professor at Ritsumeikan University, emphasized that the Kishi Nobusuke government violated parliamentary procedures to force the "passage" of the unconstitutional new "Security Treaty." Workers launching strikes to oppose this atrocity and demanding the resignation of the entire Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet is completely legitimate.

Asai pointed out that a general strike must be used to prevent the conspiracy to undermine the constitution and attempt to establish fascist politics.

Kiyokazu Okamoto, professor at Doshisha University, stated that they will fully support the June 4th general strike. Okamoto pointed out that if the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to adopt repressive policies, Japan will inevitably face the same situation as South Korea and Turkey.

According to today's "Tokyo Shimbun" report, the "Mie Prefecture Security Treaty Problem Discussion Group," composed of one hundred university professors from Mie Prefecture, issued a statement on the 1st, expressing support for and support of the June 4th general strike and the protest struggles of the masses. The statement pointed out that this strike is a concrete manifestation of the people's anger at the fascist behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government.
