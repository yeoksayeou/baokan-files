The continuous deepening of socialist construction and socialist transformation requires a comprehensive organization of people's economic life.

Since the beginning of this year, a high tide of establishing urban people's communes has emerged in Tianjin. The emergence of this high tide has greatly promoted the development of production and also prompted the more comprehensive organization of people's economic life.

By the end of April, more than 15,000 public canteens had been developed in the urban area of the city, with over 1,827,000 people joining, accounting for more than 60% of the urban population; more than 8,400 childcare organizations (including kindergartens) had been developed, with more than 311,000 children enrolled, accounting for more than 54% of the eligible children in the urban area; more than 4,900 various types of living service stations had been developed; and more than 1,700 commodity distribution points had been developed. The city has initially formed a public canteen network, a childcare network, a sewing and laundry network, a service and repair network, and a commodity distribution network with large-scale ones as the backbone and medium and small-sized ones as the main body. At the same time, more than 1,500 grass-roots units of collective life, which the masses call "Happiness Courtyards," "Bliss Buildings," and "Red Flag Hutongs," have emerged. In these units, the socialization of housework and the rationalization of the distribution of consumer goods have been realized. Housework labor such as cooking, laundry, raising children, childbirth, funerals, weddings, caring for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, sewing, repairing, and room cleaning are all "taken care of" by collective living organizations. Housewives participate in production or become staff members of collective living organizations, forming a situation where "everyone has something to do, and everything is taken care of." The broad masses of people have written tens of thousands of poems to praise this change in lifestyle. A housewife sang: "In the past, I was Sister-in-law Wang, with a lot of housework and troubles; dealing with firewood, rice, oil, and salt, sewing clothes and mending jackets; I couldn't study politics and culture, and the children bothered me; now that collective living organizations are established, I can engage in production; children are sent to nurseries, and meals are eaten in the canteen; I study and sing in my spare time, and I'm happy and in good spirits. With the Party and Chairman Mao, life is getting better and better."

The high tide of comprehensive organization of people's economic life in Tianjin is not accidental. Since the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and individual handicraft industry was basically completed in 1956, a contradiction has emerged between socialist collective production and decentralized individual small family life. The city's production has all become socialist large-scale collective production, and socialist ownership by the whole people accounts for the main component; the vast majority of factory workers, government cadres, teachers and students of schools, etc., participate in collective life to varying degrees, but most of the families of workers and staff and street residents still lead a decentralized individual life. This decentralized individual small family lifestyle seriously shackles the broad masses of housewives, preventing them from escaping the burden of tedious housework and throwing themselves into production and construction; hindering people from relying on the strength of the collective to better improve their material and cultural life; personal consumption is still in an unorganized and unplanned state, thus affecting the country's more planned and rational distribution of consumer goods; at the same time, it also hinders people from cultivating communist ideas and habits faster through collective life. In short, after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, there was an urgent need to gradually change people's lifestyles to adapt to the high-speed development of socialist production.

The contradiction between socialist collective production and decentralized individual lifestyles became more prominent in 1958. The Great Leap Forward in production urgently needed to supplement the labor force, thus requiring that all idle labor be organized and their role be fully utilized; at the same time, under the inspiration of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of housewives also urgently demanded to break away from the shackles of housework and participate in socialist construction. At this time, Chairman Mao issued the great call of "People's Communes are Good," and a high tide of people's communization emerged in the rural areas of the country. This was a clear enlightenment and a huge impetus for the people of Tianjin. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of street residents took active action and vigorously organized collective production and collective life with boiling joy. After two or three months, in the autumn of 1958, more than 400 street production and service cooperatives were established throughout the city, and several urban people's communes were also experimentally established.

By the beginning of this year, the situation had undergone great development. The continuous Great Leap Forward for two years has enabled our country's socialist construction to enter a new stage of continuous leap forward at a higher speed; the rural people's communes have been improved and consolidated, and have fully played the superiority of "large in size and collective in nature"; the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. At the same time, Tianjin's street industrial production and various collective welfare and social service undertakings have also greatly developed. In terms of establishing urban people's communes, many experiences have also been gained through pilot projects; and the banners of urban people's communes such as Hongshunli, Xing'an Road, and Huidui have been established throughout the city. All of these have laid a material and ideological foundation for the universal establishment of people's communes. The high tide of establishing urban people's communes, and one aspect of this high tide—comprehensively organizing people's economic life—emerged under such a new situation. Facts fully prove that comprehensively organizing people's economic life is an inevitable trend of the continuous leap forward of socialist construction and the continuous deepening of socialist transformation.

Comprehensively organizing people's economic life has promoted production, changed the relationship between people, and improved people's communist consciousness.

In places where people's economic life has been comprehensively organized, the benefits of collective life have been fully demonstrated. The broad masses of housewives are no longer burdened by tedious housework and can participate in production and work with peace of mind, and also have spare time to study and participate in cultural and recreational activities. After housework is "taken care of" by various collective living organizations, its nature is no longer purely individual labor serving small families, but, like other social work, has become social labor serving the broad masses of people. In this way, the social status of women engaged in socialized housework has been improved, they are respected by society, and they directly participate in social distribution and receive the deserved wage income. As some housewives said: "In the past, I was a housekeeper serving my husband and children; now I am a staff member serving the people." The relationship between people within the family has also changed, the status of women in the family has been further improved, equality between men and women has been further promoted, the remnants of feudal patriarchy and bourgeois family relations in some families have been further eradicated, and the democratic, united, and harmonious new socialist family relations have been further established and consolidated. At the same time, neighborhood relations have also been greatly improved: through collective life, feelings have been enhanced, and new neighborhood relations of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship have been established. In short, whether it is the relationship within the family or the relationship between the family and society, tremendous changes have taken place, and a new socialist way of life has developed.

Another aspect of the change caused by the comprehensive organization of people's economic life is the great improvement in the distribution and exchange of consumer goods. Due to the increase in the collective distribution, exchange, and consumption of consumer goods, favorable conditions have been created for a more planned and rational distribution of consumer goods; and the active participation of financial and trade departments in organizing people's economic life, rationally distributing commodities, and guiding mass consumption has greatly improved the planning and rationality of the distribution and exchange of consumer goods. In this regard, Guangfu Road Store in Tianjin first created some experiences. Through carrying out the movement of "learning from, catching up with, and surpassing Guangfu Road Store," this experience has universally blossomed throughout the city and has been continuously developed and improved, forming a major new development in the city's financial and trade work. In organizing people's economic life, the financial and trade departments have implemented the principle of taking production as the center, serving production, and serving the needs of the people's lives; and have adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and the mass line. They have carried out the following aspects of work: conducting in-depth investigations and constantly mastering the purchasing power, living standards, habits, preferences, etc. of the masses, and rationally distributing commodities in a planned way according to the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive arrangement, guaranteeing key points, and taking care of special needs"; combining the distribution and exchange of commodities, guiding residents in arranging their lives, and imparting and promoting various advanced cooking, sewing, and other technical experiences to help the masses live well and save money; helping people's communes, factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, etc. to establish and run various collective welfare and social service undertakings. Combining the above tasks, publicizing the Party's policies and carrying out ideological education such as building the country diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily. The distribution and exchange of consumer goods can be carried out in stores, or the commercial departments can plan to "deliver goods to the door." Because the planning of distribution and exchange has been strengthened, the distribution of consumer goods is more in line with the needs of the masses and is also adapted to planned production. From the perspective of the financial and trade departments, doing so breaks through the small circle of simply "doing business." They are not only institutions for distributing and exchanging commodities, but also organizers and guides of people's economic life, doing both economic work and political and mass work. Precisely because of this, the masses call the financial and trade workers "socialist stewards." At the same time, through the enthusiastic service of the financial and trade workers, the masses feel more deeply the care and consideration of the Party and the state for themselves, and they also love the Party and socialism more.

Since people's lifestyles are further adapted to the mode of production, and personal consumption is further adapted to the country's planned production and distribution of consumer goods, the development of production has been greatly promoted. Over the past year or so, more than 210,000 housewives in the city have been liberated from tedious housework and have participated in production and construction. They have changed from consumers to producers, becoming a vital force on the production front. Some of them have participated in the production of large factories and enterprises and various social work, and most of them have been organized to run street industrial production. With the happiness of obtaining "second liberation," they have displayed a high degree of construction enthusiasm and revolutionary vigor. In less than two years, street industry has started from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large, and from low to high, and has grown rapidly. Street industry has played a significant role in "serving large-scale industrial production, serving agriculture, serving people's lives, and serving exports," and has become an important force in the city's industrial production. On the other hand, the comprehensive organization of people's economic life has enabled the broad masses of workers and staff to concentrate their energy on production, promoting the development of production. There is such an example: at the end of 1959, in order to support nearby factories and enterprises in doing a good job in the "cross-year competition," the Guangfu Road Store went deep into the factories and enterprises to deliver meals, tea, cigarettes, etc. to the workers, and also dismantled, washed, and sewed clothes for the workers, serving the workers day and night. The workers were moved by this noble spirit of service, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher. When summarizing the experience of overfulfilling the production plan at the end of the year, the workers said: "The strong support of 'Guangfu Road' is also an important point." There are many such examples. Facts fully prove that organizing people's lives well is an important aspect of ensuring the leap forward in production.

The comprehensive organization of people's economic life has also played a huge role in improving and raising people's living standards. A large number of housewives have participated in social work, increasing family income, which has greatly improved people's living standards. Not only that, but after being organized, they can also give full play to the superiority of collective life and better improve their lives. For example, a number of public canteens in the city have realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking labor, adopted new-style stoves, and hired chefs from the catering industry to impart cooking skills, which not only greatly saves labor and fuel, but also has more than a dozen kinds of staple and non-staple foods for each meal, and some canteens can also ensure that the meals are not repeated for ten days or half a month, and the taste is better than that of ordinary households. As the masses said: "Public canteens save people, money, and are hygienic, and the meals are varied and delicious." In nurseries, laundry stations, and living service stations, it also shows that "organization is much stronger than living alone." Therefore, the masses call socialist collective life and the socialization of housework the road "leading to a happy paradise."

The high tide of comprehensive organization of people's economic life has also promoted the high tide of comprehensive organization of people's cultural life. Street residents have participated in production and work and feel more and more the necessity of learning politics, technology, and culture, so their enthusiasm for learning is unprecedentedly high. At the same time, increased income and increased leisure time have also created favorable conditions for learning. Our work is also from first focusing on organizing people's economic life, and then expanding to comprehensively organizing people's material and cultural life. So far, more than 800 various schools and spare-time study classes have been established in the streets of the city; more than 240 street libraries, clubs, and amateur troupes have been established; and more than 280 maternity hospitals, health clinics, and health centers have been established. The spare-time education network and medical and health network of urban people's communes are developing rapidly.

The high tide of comprehensive organization of people's economic life emerged on the basis of the improvement of the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of residents, and this high tide in turn promotes the further improvement of people's ideological consciousness. After participating in collective production and collective life, the broad masses of street residents have broadened their horizons, further liberated their minds, and more clearly saw the great future of socialism and communism. Their collectivist thinking and the idea of serving the people have further grown, the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation has been greatly developed, and private ownership, bourgeois individualism, feudal family concepts, etc. have been greatly weakened. Housewives said: "Now life is more meaningful, I feel more comfortable, and I am energetic in everything I do." At the same time, after the broad masses of residents are further organized, the supervision and transformation of a small number of counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements scattered in the society has also been strengthened.

Serving production and serving the people's lives is the fundamental principle for comprehensively organizing people's economic life.

The comprehensive organization of people's economic life is a deepening of the socialist revolution in people's lives. This is by no means just an economic task, but also an important political task. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, we must adhere to putting politics in command, unswervingly implement the Party's policies and policies, and conduct extensive and in-depth ideological and political education to the broad masses.

Taking production as the center, serving production, and serving the people's lives is the fundamental principle for organizing people's economic life. Collective production is the foundation of collective life. If we do not first vigorously organize collective production, the masses will not feel the necessity of organizing collective life, and there will be no material basis for organizing collective life; and the purpose of organizing collective life is precisely to ensure and promote the high-speed development of production. Only along this direction can we organize collective life well and continuously improve people's lives on the basis of continuous development of production. In the process of organizing people's economic life in Tianjin, some people initially thought that cooking, washing clothes, and taking care of children were all trivial matters of life, so how could we talk about serving production? Practice corrected these people's views. Facts have proved that serving producers is serving production. People are the most active and positive factor in the productive forces. The quality of people's lives directly affects people's energy and emotions. Comprehensively caring for people and organizing collective life with great enthusiasm can enable people to maintain abundant energy and make people deeply feel the warmth of the new society, so as to do a good job in production with greater revolutionary drive.

In the work of organizing people's economic life, we must conscientiously implement the mass line. Changing lifestyles and creating a new and beautiful life is a matter for the people themselves, and must be carried out from the interests of the masses, according to the wishes of the masses, and relying on the strength of the masses themselves. Tianjin was originally an old industrial and commercial city, the classes and strata are complex, and the differences in people's living standards, habits, tastes, hobbies, cultural level, and ideological level are quite large. Therefore, when organizing people's lives, we must consider adapting as much as possible to the different needs of different people. In running various collective welfare and social service undertakings, we must adhere to letting go and mobilizing the masses, consulting with the masses in case of trouble, relying on the masses to build them with their own hands, and relying on the masses to manage them democratically; and we must emphasize that they should be run flexibly, diversely, and conveniently for residents, and strive to satisfy all those who participate in collective life. In the distribution of commodities, we must adhere to conducting in-depth investigations and research, earnestly listen to the opinions of the masses, and conscientiously implement the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive arrangement, guaranteeing key points, and taking care of special needs," so as to prevent "attending to one thing and losing sight of another" and also prevent the implementation of egalitarian distribution.

"Actively run well, voluntarily participate" is an extremely important principle for organizing collective life. Urban residents have different classes and strata, and their ideological level, living standards, etc. are also different, and their views and requirements for collective life are very different. However, the broad masses of working people, especially the vast majority of workers' families, urgently demand to organize collective life, and we should actively meet their requirements first. We must first absorb those who have real needs and urgent requirements to participate, and we must actively run them well; as for those who have not yet participated in collective life and still have concerns, we will not force them to participate, and we should focus on creating better conditions and consider absorbing them when they truly have this requirement in the future.

In running various collective welfare and social service undertakings, we have adopted the principle of combining "large, medium, and small," with large-scale ones as the backbone and medium and small-sized ones as the main body. This is convenient for letting go and mobilizing the masses, making full use of all favorable conditions, and rapidly establishing them; it can also make public canteens, nurseries, laundry stations, etc. rationally distributed in various streets and alleys, convenient for the masses; and it can also enable large-scale ones to drive medium and small-sized ones to continuously improve.

In running various collective welfare and social service undertakings, we must also closely combine development and improvement, and adopt the principle of "developing, consolidating, and improving simultaneously." First, with a spirit of active development, we will rapidly establish various collective welfare and social service undertakings to meet the urgent requirements of the broad masses of people to participate in collective life. At the same time, we must also consider the subjective and objective conditions to make the various collective welfare and social service undertakings that have been established rapidly consolidated and improved. At present, the city is grasping the enrichment of service work content, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, improving the quality of service work, relying on the masses to increase the necessary equipment through self-reliance, actively improving and improving management work, and striving to run them well, so as to establish a batch, consolidate a batch, and continuously improve.

For running various collective welfare and social service undertakings, we must adhere to the principle of "running all undertakings diligently and thriftily" and make them good and economical. We must strive to improve the lives of the masses and save manpower, materials, and financial resources. Only in this way can we ensure the consolidation of collective welfare and social service undertakings and give full play to the superiority of collective life. In the distribution of commodities and guiding the consumption of the masses, we should also combine the supply of the masses' living needs with the propaganda of thrift and the promotion of savings, and help the masses live well and save money. Only in this way can it benefit the country and the people and truly be welcomed by the broad masses.

The comprehensive organization of people's economic life is a national work that requires the mobilization of the entire Party and the hands of the entire people. Various urban people's communes, as well as factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, etc., must take on the main responsibility of organizing the lives of the masses in their units. The financial and trade departments control the distribution and exchange of commodities and are extremely closely related to the economic life of the broad masses of people, and have a special role in organizing people's economic life that other departments cannot replace. Therefore, the financial and trade departments are an important assistant to the Party and the government in organizing people's economic life, and must continue to play its role. Experience has proved that only under the unified leadership of the Party committee, fully mobilizing the forces of all aspects, strengthening cooperation between each other, especially strengthening cooperation between the financial and trade departments and various units, can we comprehensively organize people's economic life well.

At present, the high tide of comprehensive organization of people's economic life in Tianjin is continuing to develop extensively and deeply. It has already and will further cause changes in the lives of the people throughout the city, greatly promote the improvement of people's socialist and communist consciousness, and promote the high-speed development of socialist construction.

    全面组织人民经济生活，促进社会主义建设高速度发展
    中共天津市委第一书记　万晓塘
    社会主义建设和社会主义改造的不断深入，要求全面组织人民经济生活
    今年以来，天津市出现了城市办人民公社的高潮。这个高潮的出现，大大促进了生产的发展，也促使人民经济生活更全面地组织起来。
    到4月底，全市市区的公共食堂已经发展到一万五千多个，有一百八十二万七千多人入伙，占市区人口的60％以上；托儿组织（包括幼儿园）发展到八千四百多个，入托儿童三十一万一千余人，占市区适龄儿童的54％以上；各种生活服务站发展到四千九百多个；商品分配点发展到一千七百多个。全市已经初步形成了以大型为骨干、中小型为主的公共食堂网、托儿网、缝纫洗衣网、服务修配网、商品分配网。同时，还出现了一千五百多个群众称为“幸福大院”、“美满大楼”、“红旗胡同”的集体生活基层单位。在这些单位已经实现了家务劳动社会化、生活消费品分配合理化。像作饭、洗衣、抚养子女、生育、丧葬、办喜事、照顾老弱病残、缝补、修配和房间清洁等家务劳动，都由集体生活组织“包”了下来，家庭妇女参加了生产或变成了集体生活组织的工作人员，形成了“人人有事作，事事有人管”的局面。广大群众对于生活方式上的这种变革，写出了成千上万的诗歌来赞颂。一位家庭妇女唱道：“从前我是王大嫂，家务事情多苦恼；办些柴米油盐事，又缝衣裤又补袄；政治文化不能学，孩子缠得心烦恼。集体生活组织起，我才能把生产搞；娃娃送进托儿所，吃饭就往食堂跑；业余学习又唱歌，乐乐呵呵精神好。有了党和毛主席，生活越过越美好。”
    天津市全面组织人民经济生活的高潮的出现，并不是偶然的。自从1956年基本上完成对资本主义工商业和个体手工业的社会主义改造以后，就出现了社会主义的集体生产同分散的个体的小家庭生活之间的矛盾。全市的生产都已变成社会主义的大集体生产，而且社会主义的全民所有制占主要成分；广大工厂企业职工、机关干部、学校师生等都在不同程度上参加了集体生活，但是大多数职工家属和街道居民却依然过着分散的个体的生活。这种分散的个体的小家庭生活方式，严重地束缚着广大家庭妇女，使她们不能摆脱繁琐的家务劳动而投入生产建设；阻碍着人们依靠集体的力量来更好地改善物质生活和文化生活；个人消费还停留在无组织无计划的状态，因而影响国家更有计划地更合理地分配生活消费品；同时，也妨碍人们通过集体生活来更快地培养共产主义的思想和习惯。总之，当生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，就迫切需要逐步变革人们的生活方式，使之适应社会主义生产的高速度发展。
    社会主义的集体生产与分散的个体的生活方式的矛盾，发展到1958年暴露得更突出了。生产的大跃进，迫切需要补充劳动力，因而要求把所有闲散劳动力都组织起来，充分发挥他们的作用；同时，广大家庭妇女在总路线、大跃进的鼓舞下，也迫切要求摆脱家务劳动的束缚，参加社会主义建设。正在这时，毛主席发出了“人民公社好”的伟大号召，全国农村出现了人民公社化的高潮。这对天津人民是一个明确的启示和巨大的推动。广大街道居民在党的领导下，积极行动起来，以沸腾的欢乐心情大力组织集体生产和集体生活。经过两三个月的时间，在1958年秋天，全市便建立起四百多个街道生产服务合作社，并且试办了几个城市人民公社。
    到今年年初，形势又有了很大的发展。连续两年大跃进，使我国的社会主义建设进入了以更高速度持续跃进的新阶段；农村人民公社健全、巩固起来了，充分发挥了“一大二公”的优越性；总路线、大跃进、人民公社更加深入人心了。同时，天津市街道工业生产和各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业都有了很大的发展。在建立城市人民公社方面，通过试点工作，也取得了许多经验；并且在全市树立了鸿顺里、兴安路、灰堆等城市人民公社的旗帜。所有这些，都为普遍建立人民公社奠定了物质的和思想的基础。城市办人民公社的高潮，以及这个高潮的一个方面——全面组织人民经济生活，正是在这样一个新的形势下出现的。事实充分证明：全面组织人民经济生活，是社会主义建设持续跃进和社会主义改造不断深入的必然趋势。
    全面组织人民经济生活，促进了生产，改变了人与人的关系，提高了人们的共产主义觉悟
    在全面地组织了人民经济生活的地方，已充分显示出集体生活的好处。广大家庭妇女不再为繁琐的家务劳动所拖累，可以安心地参加生产和工作，并且有了业余的学习时间和参加文化娱乐活动的时间。家务劳动由各种集体生活组织“包”下来以后，它的性质已不再是单纯为小家庭服务的个体劳动，而是和其它社会工作一样，成为服务于广大人民群众的社会劳动。这样，从事社会化家务劳动的妇女的社会地位提高了，她们受到社会的尊敬，并且直接参加社会分配，获得了应得的工资收入。正如有的家庭妇女所说：“过去是为丈夫和孩子服务的看家婆，现在是为人民服务的工作人员了。”家庭内部人与人之间的关系也改变了，妇女在家庭中的地位进一步提高了，男女之间进一步平等了，某些家庭中的封建家长制残余和资产阶级式的家庭关系进一步被铲除了，民主、团结、和睦的社会主义的新型的家庭关系进一步树立和巩固了。同时，邻里关系也大大改善了：通过集体生活，增进了感情，建立起了团结、互助、友爱的新的邻里关系。总之，无论家庭内部的关系、家庭与社会的关系，都发生了巨大的变化，一种新的社会主义的生活方式发展起来了。
    全面组织人民经济生活所引起的另一方面的变化，是大大改进了生活消费品的分配和交换。由于生活消费品的集体分配、交换和消费增多了，这就为更有计划、更合理地分配生活消费品创造了有利条件；而财贸部门积极参与组织人民经济生活，合理地分配商品和指导群众消费，则使生活消费品的分配、交换的计划性和合理程度大大提高。在这方面，天津市光复道商店首先创造出了一些经验。而通过开展“学、赶、超光复道商店”的运动，这一经验在全市普遍开花，并且不断地得到发展和提高，形成了全市财贸工作的一个重大的新发展。财贸部门在组织人民经济生活方面，贯彻了以生产为中心，为生产服务、为群众生活需要服务的方针；坚持了政治挂帅和群众路线。他们进行了以下几方面的工作：深入调查和经常掌握群众的购买力、生活水平、习惯、喜好等等，根据“统筹兼顾、全面安排、保证重点、照顾特需”的原则，有计划地合理地分配商品；结合分配和交换商品，指导居民群众安排生活，并且传授和推广各种先进的烹饪、缝纫等技术经验，帮助群众把日子过好过省；帮助人民公社、工厂企业、机关、学校等建立和办好各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业。结合上述各项工作，向群众宣传党的方针政策，进行勤俭建国、勤俭持家等思想教育。生活消费品的分配和交换，既可以在商店进行，也可以由商业部门有计划地“送货上门”。由于分配和交换的计划性加强了，生活消费品的分配就更加切合群众的需要，也与计划性生产相适应了。从财贸部门来说，这样做就突破了原先那种单纯“作买卖”的小圈子。它们已不仅是分配和交换商品的机构，而且也是人民经济生活的组织者和指导者，既作经济工作，也作政治工作和群众工作。正因为如此，所以群众把财贸工作人员称作“社会主义的管家人”。同时，通过财贸工作人员的热忱服务，群众更加感到党和国家对自己的关怀和体贴，也就更加热爱党和社会主义了。
    由于人们的生活方式与生产方式进一步相适应，个人消费同国家对于生活消费品的有计划生产和分配进一步相适应，因而大大促进了生产的发展。一年多来，全市从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来参加生产建设的家庭妇女，就有二十一万多人。她们从消费人口变为生产人口，成为生产战线上的一支生力军。其中一部分人参加了大工厂企业的生产和各种社会工作，大多数人则组织起来举办街道工业生产。她们以获得“第二次解放”的幸福感，发挥了高度的建设热情和革命干劲。不到两年时间，街道工业白手起家，从无到有，从小到大，从低到高，迅速地成长起来。街道工业在“为大工业生产服务、为农业服务、为人民生活服务、为出口服务”方面，发挥了显著的作用，已经成为全市工业生产中一支重要的力量。另一方面，由于全面组织了人民的经济生活，从而使广大职工能够集中精力来搞生产，促进了生产的发展。有这样一个事例：1959年年底，光复道商店为了支援附近的工厂企业搞好“跨年竞赛”，他们深入到工厂企业中去，把饭菜、茶水、纸烟等等送到工人身边，还代工人拆洗缝补衣服，昼夜为职工服务。工人们被这种高尚的服务精神所感动，生产热情更加高涨，在年终总结超额完成生产计划的经验时，职工们说：“‘光复道’的大力支援也是重要的一条”。这样的事例是很多的。事实充分证明，组织好人民生活是保证生产跃进的一个重要方面。
    全面组织人民经济生活，在改善和提高人民生活方面也发挥了巨大的作用。大量家庭妇女参加了社会工作，增加了家庭收入，这就大大提高了人民的生活水平。不仅如此，组织起来以后，还可以发挥集体生活的优越性，更好地改善生活。例如，全市已经有一批公共食堂实现了炊事劳动机械化、半机械化，采用了新式炉灶，聘请了饮食行业的厨师传授烹调技术，不仅大大节省了劳动力和燃料，而且每顿饭都有十几种以上的主副食品，有的食堂还可以做到饭菜十天半月不重样，味道也比一般人家做得好。正如群众所说：“公共食堂省人省钱又卫生，饭菜样多味道香。”在托儿所、洗衣站、生活服务站等方面，也同样显示出“组织起来比单过强得多”。因此，群众把社会主义的集体生活和家务劳动社会化称作“通往幸福天堂”的道路。
    全面组织人民经济生活的高潮，还推动了全面组织人民文化生活的高潮。街道居民群众参加了生产和工作，更加感到学习政治、技术和文化的必要，因此学习热情空前高涨。同时，收入增多了，业余时间增多了，也为学习创造了有利条件。我们的工作，也是从首先着重组织人民经济生活，进而扩展到全面组织人民的物质生活和文化生活的。到目前为止，全市各街道共办起各种学校和业余学习班八百多个；建立起街道图书馆、俱乐部、业余剧团等二百四十多个，妇产院、卫生院、保健院等二百八十多个。城市人民公社的业余教育网、医疗卫生网正在迅速发展。
    全面组织人民经济生活的高潮，是在广大居民群众的思想觉悟提高的基础上出现的，而这个高潮又反过来促进着人们思想觉悟的进一步提高。广大街道居民群众，参加了集体生产和集体生活以后，眼界开阔了，思想进一步解放了，更加清楚地看到了社会主义和共产主义的伟大前途。他们的集体主义思想、为人民服务的思想进一步增长，团结、互助、协作的精神大大发扬，私有观念、资产阶级个人主义、封建家庭观念等等大为削弱。家庭妇女们说：“现在生活得更有意义了，心情舒畅了，干什么工作都带劲。”同时，广大居民群众进一步组织起来以后，对于散处在社会上的少数反革命分子及其他坏分子的监督和改造也加强了。
    为生产服务，为人民生活服务，是全面组织人民经济生活的根本方针
    全面组织人民经济生活，是社会主义革命在人们生活方面的深化。这绝不仅是一项经济工作，而且也是一项重要的政治工作。因此，必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，坚定不移地贯彻党的方针、政策，并且向广大群众进行广泛深入的思想政治教育。
    以生产为中心，为生产服务、为群众生活服务，这是组织人民经济生活的根本方针。集体生产是集体生活的基础。如果不首先大力组织集体生产，群众就感觉不到组织集体生活的必要性，也没有组织集体生活的物质基础；而组织集体生活的目的，也正是为了保证和促进生产的高速度发展。只有沿着这个方向，才能把集体生活组织好，并且在生产不断发展的基础上，不断改善人民的生活。天津市在组织人民经济生活的过程中，开始有人认为：作饭、洗衣、看孩子，都是生活琐事，怎么谈得上为生产服务呢？实践纠正了这些人的看法。事实证明，为生产者服务就是为生产服务。人是生产力中最活跃最积极的因素。人们生活的好坏，直接影响着人们的精力和情绪。全面关心人，以极大的热情把集体的生活组织好，就可以使人们保持充沛的精力，并使人们深刻感到新社会的温暖，以更大的革命干劲来搞好生产。
    在组织人民经济生活的工作中，必须认真贯彻执行群众路线。变革生活方式，创建新的美好的生活，是人民群众自己的事情，必须从群众的利益出发，根据群众的意愿，依靠群众自己的力量去进行。天津市原是一个旧的工商业大城市，阶级、阶层复杂，人们在生活水平、习惯、口味、爱好、文化水平以及思想水平等方面的差别相当大，因此在组织人民生活的时候，就必须考虑尽可能适应不同人的不同需要。在举办各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业方面，要坚持放手发动群众，遇事和群众商量，依靠群众动手建立，依靠群众民主管理；并且要强调办得灵活，多样，便利居民，力求使所有参加集体生活的人满意。在分配商品方面，要坚持深入地进行调查研究，认真倾听群众意见，切实贯彻执行“统筹兼顾，全面安排，保证重点，照顾特需”的原则，既要防止“顾此失彼”，又要防止实行平均主义地分配。
    “积极办好，自愿参加”是组织集体生活的一个极为重要的方针。城市居民的阶级、阶层不同，他们的思想水平、生活水平等方面也有差异，他们对于集体生活的看法和要求就有很大差别。但是，广大劳动人民，特别是广大职工家属，绝大多数是迫切要求组织集体生活的，我们应该以积极的态度首先满足他们的要求。要首先吸收那些有真正需要和迫切要求的人参加，而且要积极办好；至于那些目前还没有参加集体生活的要求和还存在顾虑的人，则不勉强吸收他们参加，应当着重创造更好的条件，待将来他们真正有这种要求的时候，再考虑吸收他们参加。
    在举办各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业方面，我们采取了以大型为骨干，以中小型为主的“大、中、小”相结合的方针。这样既便于放手发动群众，充分利用一切有利条件，迅速兴办起来；又能使公共食堂、托儿所、洗衣站等合理地分布在各个街道、里巷，便利群众；还可以使大型的带动中、小型的不断提高。
    在举办各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业方面，还要把发展与提高紧密地结合起来，采取“边发展、边巩固、边提高”的方针。首先以积极发展的精神迅速地把各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业办起来，以满足广大群众参加集体生活的迫切要求。同时又要考虑到主客观条件，使已办起来的各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业迅速地得到巩固和提高。目前，全市正对已经建立起来的集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，抓紧充实服务工作内容，大力开展技术革新、技术革命，提高服务工作质量，依靠群众自力更生地增添必要设备，积极健全和改进管理工作，努力办好，以求建立一批，巩固一批，并且不断提高。
    对于举办各种集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，必须坚持“勤俭办一切事业”的方针，作到又好又省。既要努力改善群众生活，又要节约人力、物力和财力。这样才能保证集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业的巩固，并充分发挥集体生活的优越性。在分配商品、指导群众的消费中，同样应当把供应群众生活需要和宣传节约、提倡储蓄结合起来，帮助群众把日子过好过省。这样，才能利国利民，真正受到广大群众的欢迎。
    全面组织人民经济生活，是一项全民性的工作，必须全党动员，全民动手。各个城市人民公社以及工厂企业、机关、学校等等，都要把组织本单位群众生活的主要责任担负起来。财贸部门掌握着商品的分配和交换，与广大人民群众的经济生活联系极其密切，在组织人民经济生活中具有其他部门所不能代替的特殊作用。因此，财贸部门是党和政府组织人民经济生活的重要助手，必须继续发挥它的作用。经验证明：只有在党委的统一领导下，把各个方面的力量充分调动起来，加强相互之间的协作，特别是加强财贸部门与各单位之间的协作，才能把人民经济生活全面地组织好。
    目前，天津市全面组织人民经济生活的高潮正在继续广泛深入地发展。它已经而且还将进一步引起全市人民生活的变化，大大促进人们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的提高，促进社会主义建设的高速度发展。
