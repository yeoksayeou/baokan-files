To promote the consolidation and development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and to meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in production for mechanical equipment spare parts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company adopted a method combining spare parts production, planned management, and user departments. They conducted an in-depth inspection of the planning, needs, and production of spare parts. When problems were discovered, they immediately worked together to solve them. This ensured that the spare parts supplied were what was needed, and that what was needed was supplied in a timely manner, creating favorable conditions for completing half of this year's plan in the first half of the year and ensuring the completion of the production plan for the second half of the year.

Since the beginning of this year, with the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and the high-speed leap forward in production, the consumption of some spare parts has increased. Although the production of spare parts has increased month by month, it still cannot meet the needs. In late April, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Machinery Department, various repair plants, and production plants and mines jointly formed a spare parts production inspection team consisting of leading cadres, technicians, and workers. They inspected more than 40 plants and mines. Through inspection, they understood the actual needs of various mechanical spare parts. Based on the degree of importance and urgency, they rationally arranged the production of spare parts; spare parts that were insufficiently stocked were immediately rushed to increase reserves, missing spare parts were immediately arranged for production to supplement, key spare parts were urgently organized for a concentrated effort, and a certain amount of reserves were also made for new mechanical equipment accessories put into production in the technical innovation movement. In the past month, the repair plants of Anshan Iron and Steel Company produced more than 1,000 items, totaling more than 10,000 pieces, of key spare parts, which was more than 35% more than in April. This ensured that worn mechanical parts were replaced in a timely manner, ensuring the normal operation of mechanical equipment and improving equipment utilization.

In order to rush out key spare parts for mechanical equipment in a short period of time, each repair plant assigned the processing of key spare parts to machine tools, the forging of parts to power hammers, and the casting of parts to groups. A heated competition for manufacturing spare parts was launched between the repair plants, between the groups, and between the machine tools. In order to complete the spare parts production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill the target, the staff and workers of the Southern Repair Plant worked hard to improve their operating skills. In the first 25 days of May alone, the key spare parts completed by the entire plant exceeded the entire month of April by more than one time. When producing key spare parts for the crane drum for the Third Steelmaking Plant, Li Jingfang, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, and other leading cadres personally followed the shifts day and night, and the processing speed was faster at each successive stage. As a result, it was completed five days ahead of schedule. The Northern Repair Plant and the Western Repair Plant also showed no weakness, and they formed shock teams to grab key spare parts and other forms to accelerate the production speed of spare parts, so that the spare parts production plan was completed on schedule and ahead of schedule.

    为夺钢大战提供充分的物质条件
    鞍钢狠抓机械备品生产
    本报鞍山7日电　为了促进技术革新和技术革命运动的巩固、发展，满足生产不断跃进对机械设备备品的需要，鞍山钢铁公司采取备品生产、计划管理、使用部门三结合的方法，对备品的计划、需要和生产情况进行了深入检查，发现问题，立即协力解决，从而使备品生产做到所供必须是所需，所需又必须及时供给，为上半年完成今年计划的一半和保证下半年生产计划完成，创造了良好条件。
    今年以来，伴随技术革新技术革命运动的蓬勃发展和生产高速度跃进，某些备品的消耗量增大了，备品的生产虽然逐月增长，却仍满足不了需要。4月下旬，鞍钢机械处各机修厂和生产厂矿共同组成有领导干部、技术人员和工人参加的备品生产检查团，到四十多个厂矿进行了检查。通过检查，摸清了各种机械备品的实际需要情况，从而根据轻重缓急，合理安排了备品的生产；对储备不足的备品立即赶制增加储备，对缺欠备品马上安排生产补充，对关键备品急速组织突击，对技术革新运动中投入生产的新机械设备配件，也进行一定数量的储备。近一个月，鞍钢各机修厂共生产了一千多项万余件关键备品，比4月份多生产了35％以上，使磨损的机械零件该换的得到及时更换，保证了机械设备正常运转，提高了设备运用率。
    为了使机械设备关键备品在短时间内赶制出来，各机修厂都把关键备品加工件落实到机床、锻件落实到电锤、铸件落实到小组。各机修厂之间、小组与小组和机床与机床之间，展开火热的制造备品竞赛。南部机修厂职工为了使备品生产计划提前与超额完成，努力提高操作技术。全厂仅在5月头二十五天里完成的关键备品，就超过4月全月一倍多。在为第三炼钢厂生产吊车卷筒关键备件时，这个厂的党委书记李景芳等领导干部昼夜亲自跟班，加工速度一道工序比一道工序快，结果比原计划提前五天完成。北部机修厂、西部机修厂也不示弱，纷纷组成抢关键备品突击组等形式，加快备品生产速度，使备品生产计划按期和提前完成。
