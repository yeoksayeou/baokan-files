Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 6th: The Mudanjiang Locomotive Factory launched a mass "Four Modernizations" upgrading campaign of large-scale inspection, summary, consolidation, promotion, and improvement. In just over a month, 443 experiences were integrated and put into use.

After vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Mudanjiang Locomotive Factory rapidly improved its level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. However, some technical innovation projects were not perfect and had not been formally put into production. In order to consolidate and expand the achievements of technical innovation, the factory mobilized its workers to adopt the methods of "four inspections," "six fixings," and "one acceptance" to carry out the "Four Modernizations" upgrading production campaign. "Four inspections" are: inspect remaining manual operations, inspect the performance of technical innovation projects, inspect the integration situation, and inspect whether the construction site layout is reasonable; "six fixings" are: standardize integration, set quota standards, set processes, set operating procedures, set workplace layout, and set labor organization; "one acceptance" is: a "three-way combination" acceptance team composed of workshop leaders, technical personnel, and workers conducts evaluation, acceptance, and exchange of advanced experiences.

After "four inspections, six fixings, and one acceptance," each workshop and each process clarified the existing problems and the direction of upgrading, and worked together to solve problems. For example, the locomotive workshop found that the underframe section still had seven heavy manual operations left, and immediately organized forces to make breakthroughs, turning manual operations into mechanization and semi-mechanization. The mechanical workshop clarified the direction of upgrading, not to achieve full automation all at once, but to "do as much as possible first." So everyone started working and quickly made 40% of the machine tools in the entire workshop achieve partial automation.

Due to the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation achievements, the factory completed half of its annual output value and major product output plans ahead of schedule. The average daily production level in May increased by 11.4% compared to the average daily production level in the first quarter.

This newspaper reports: Chongqing Rainproof Canvas Factory workers, on the basis of basically achieving mechanized production, took advantage of the victory to advance, vigorously engaged in the "Four Modernizations" to fill gaps, complete sets, and upgrade, attacked "hard bones," further improved the degree of mechanization, and marched towards a "semi-automatic, automatic factory," promoting a sustained great leap forward in production.

The vast majority of the factory's workers used to perform manual operations. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations," after the entire factory's workers worked tirelessly and cleverly, semi-mechanized and mechanized production had been basically achieved by March. However, because the innovation projects were not integrated and individual processes had not achieved mechanized production, the power of the entire mechanized innovation project was often affected. According to this situation, the Party branch mobilized the workers to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, vigorously engaged in the gap-filling and complete sets of mechanization and semi-mechanization to form a dragon-like mechanized production, and vigorously engaged in mechanization upgrading, "marching towards a semi-automatic, automatic factory."

The Party branch told the workers about the significance of integration and consolidation and improvement, explaining that only by continuously consolidating and improving the achievements of the "Four Modernizations" can labor productivity be further improved, labor be saved, and conditions be created for vigorously adopting new technologies and new processes, and vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization and other technical innovations. At the same time, it spoke about the endless nature of the "Four Modernizations," the principle that "there is always something beyond," using the thought of continuous revolution to arm the masses and mobilize the workers to conduct extensive discussions. During the discussions, the workers cited many facts to illustrate that mechanization and automation are endless. They cited that when the factory first started the "Four Modernizations," they didn't even have a single screw, a single red stove, or a single technician, and they still managed to accomplish so many mechanization projects. Now they have a certain foundation and experience and have trained a large number of technical workers, so as long as everyone puts in greater effort, an automated factory can definitely be achieved. The workers put forward the bold statement: "We must climb high and drill deep. We will not be satisfied until we achieve an automated factory." And they immediately took action.

In order to make the movement more planned and step-by-step, the factory leadership promptly formulated a plan and adopted the method of organizing battles in stages, carrying out breakthroughs in batches. The factory leaders went deep into the key innovation projects, eating, living, and working with the workers, so that many difficult "hard bones" were gnawed away, and many "Four Modernizations" projects were rapidly upgraded. For example, Xiang Xichao, the deputy director of the factory who came from a dyeing and finishing worker background, also returned to the workshop. Targeting the weak links of unclean washing and low cloth drying efficiency, he worked with the workers to adjust the washing tank and change the structure of the dryer, which immediately increased production efficiency by 30%, solving the contradiction between the dyeing and drying processes. Then, targeting the key problems of low folding and stacking efficiency and high labor intensity for workers, they simplified the structure based on the principles of "foreign" machines, eliminated many parts, and created a native cloth-stacking machine, enabling the entire workshop to achieve automated production from the entry of the blank material into the workshop to the exit of the finished product.

Encouraged by these specific facts, the workers' enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger. They took turns targeting some of the imperfect innovation projects in their workshops, brainstorming ideas and thinking of ways to tackle the "hard bones," thus solving many long-standing key problems. Due to the continuous consolidation and development of the "Four Modernizations" movement, a sustained leap forward in production was promoted. The factory's total output value completed in April increased by 35.5% compared with March, and increased by 5.5 times compared with the same period last year. The total output value completed in May increased by more than 63% compared with April.

    牡丹江机车厂、重庆防雨篷布厂坚持不断革命精神
    提高“四化”水平产量迅速增长
    据新华社哈尔滨6日电　牡丹江机车厂开展群众性的大检查、大总结、大巩固、大推广、大提高的“四化”升级运动会，仅一个多月时间，就使四百四十三项经验配套成龙，推广使用。
    牡丹江机车厂在蓬勃开展技术革新和技术革命运动以后，机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化程度迅速提高。但是还有些技术革新项目不够完善，没有正式投入生产。为了巩固和扩大技术革新的成果，这个厂发动职工，采取“四查”、“六定”、“一验收”的办法，开展了“四化”升级生产运动会。“四查”是：查残余手工操作，查技术革新项目的性能，查配套成龙情况，查工地布置是否合理；“六定”是：定型配套，定定额标准，定工艺，定操作规程，定工作场地布置，定劳动组织；“一验收”是：由车间领导干部、技职人员、工人组成“三结合”验收团，对先进经验进行评比验收和交流。
    各车间各个工序经过“四查、六定、一验收”，明确了存在的问题和升级方向，并且多方协作，突击解决。如机车车间发现车架工段尚遗留有七项笨重的手工操作，立即组织力量突击，使手工操作变为机械化半机械化。机械车间明确了升级方向，不是一下子全部实现自动化，而是“能搞多少，先搞多少”，于是大家动手，很快使全车间40％机床实现了局部自动化。
    由于巩固、推广、提高了技术革新成果，促使这个厂提前完成了全年产值和主要产品产量计划的一半；5月份的平均日产水平比第一季度平均日产水平提高11．4％。
    本报讯　重庆防雨篷布厂职工在基本实现机械化生产的基础上，乘胜挺进，大搞“四化”的补缺配套和升级工作，突击“硬骨头”进一步提高机械化程度，向“半自动化、自动化工厂”大举进军，促进了生产的持续大跃进。
    这个厂绝大部分工人过去是手工操作，在以“四化”为中心的技术革新技术革命运动中，经过全厂职工穷干、巧干，3月份就已基本实现了半机械化、机械化生产。但是，由于革新项目没有配套成龙，个别工序没有实现机械化生产，常常影响到整个机械化革新项目发挥威力。党支部根据这种情况，发动职工发扬不断革命的精神，大搞机械化、半机械化的补缺配套，形成一条龙的机械化生产，并大搞机械化升级，“向半自动化、自动化工厂”大举进军。
    党支部向职工大讲配套成龙和巩固提高的意义，说明只有不断巩固提高“四化”的成果，才能进一步提高劳动生产率，节约劳动力，并为大力采用新技术、新工艺，大搞综合利用等其他技术革新创造条件。同时，大讲“四化”无止境、“天外还有天”的道理，以不断革命的思想武装群众，发动职工广泛开展讨论。工人们在讨论中列举了很多事实说明机械化、自动化是无止境的。他们举出了本厂最初搞“四化”的时候，连一个螺丝钉、一个红炉、一个技术员也没有，都搞了这样多的机械化项目，现在已经有了一定的基础和经验，并培养了大批技术工人，只要大家鼓足更大的干劲，自动化工厂是一定能够实现的。工人们提出了：“天高要攀、地厚要钻，不实现自动化工厂心不甘”的豪言壮语，并马上就行动了起来。
    为了使运动更有计划、有步骤地开展，厂领导及时地制订了规划，并采用分阶段组织战役的办法，分批进行突击。厂的领导干部都深入到关键革新项目中去，和工人一起同吃同住同劳动，使很多比较难啃的“硬骨头”纷纷被啃掉，很多“四化”项目迅速升级。如染整工人出身的副厂长项锡超也回到了车间，针对洗色不净和烘布效率低的薄弱环节，同工人们一起设法调整了洗缸，改变了烘干机的结构，使生产效率马上提高了30％，解决了染布和烘干两道工序之间的矛盾。接着他们又针对折布、码布效率低，工人劳动强度大的关键，根据“洋”机器的原理，结合本厂情况，简化结构，省去了不少零件，搞成了土码布机，使整个车间生产从胚料进车间到成品出车间，全部实现了自动化的生产。
    在这些具体事实的鼓舞下，职工们的干劲愈干愈大，纷纷针对本车间一些不完善的革新项目，动脑筋、想办法，大啃“硬骨头”，因而使很多长期没有解决的关键问题得到了解决。由于“四化”运动的不断巩固和发展，促进了生产的持续跃进。这个厂4月份完成的总产值比3月份提高了35．5％，比去年同期提高五点五倍，5月份完成的总产值又比4月份提高了63％以上。
