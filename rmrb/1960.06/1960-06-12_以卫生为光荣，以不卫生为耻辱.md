    Taking Hygiene as an Honor, Taking Unhygienic Practices as a Disgrace
    Fu Lianzhang
    Speaking of hygiene, people cannot help but praise our beautiful capital, Beijing. You see, summer is normally a season when flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, and rats are rampant, but now they have been reduced to near-eradication; summer is normally a season when gastrointestinal infectious diseases are frequent, but now the incidence of these diseases has decreased significantly. Emphasizing hygiene has gradually become a daily habit of the broad masses and a regular, mass, and organized action. Not only is this the case in Beijing, but there is also Foshan City in Guangdong, where people have transformed it from a dilapidated and dirty city of the old society into a clean and beautiful city. There is Jishan County in Shanxi, which has eliminated the four pests and basically eradicated and controlled several major diseases that endanger people's health, and is now advancing towards the higher goals of eradicating the four pests, achieving longevity and prosperity, popularizing higher hygiene and scientific knowledge, and greening, beautifying, and perfuming the environment. Countless cities and villages across the country, on the basis of their victory in eliminating pests and diseases, are continuously leaping forward under the slogans of "Learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, surpass Foshan" and "Learn from Jishan, catch up with Jishan, surpass Jishan."
    For each of us, in addition to actively responding to the Party's call to participate in the hygiene movement, we should further establish a new moral custom of "taking hygiene as an honor and unhygienic practices as a disgrace" and develop habits of loving hygiene.
    Why is emphasizing hygiene an honor, and why are unhygienic practices a disgrace? Perhaps a few people believe that only good work, good production, and good study are honorable, while hygiene is merely a "minor matter" that is "harmless." Indeed, good production, good work, and good study are very honorable, but emphasizing hygiene is not a "minor matter" either. It is also a major event, a major event of transforming customs and reforming the world. Doing a good job in hygiene is conducive to production, conducive to work, conducive to learning, and conducive to enhancing people's physical fitness. Foshan City has good hygiene, and there are very few cases of factory workers being absent from work due to illness, so production is even better. Jishan County is a red banner county for hygiene and also a high-yield county for wheat. Production and hygiene are both leaping forward, isn't that honorable! Conversely, if one does not pay attention to hygiene, it will affect one's health and also hinder production, work, and study, which can be said to be a disgraceful thing.
    Developing personal hygiene habits is also beneficial to the collective. We work, study, and live in the collective of the masses, and a person who does not pay attention to cleanliness will affect the surrounding masses. For example, spitting everywhere not only makes the environment dirty, but if it is the sputum of a person with a respiratory infectious disease, it will also bring germs into the air, posing a danger of transmitting the disease to others. Another example is throwing away dirty things at will, which increases breeding grounds for bacteria and destroys the hygienic environment that everyone has cleaned. A person with socialist and communist moral qualities will take pride in cherishing the collective and respecting the fruits of the labor of the masses, and regard those behaviors that damage the interests of the masses as shameful.
    Some bourgeois spokesmen in capitalist countries have always boasted about their so-called "civilization" and "hygiene." But what kind of stuff are they? Capitalists exploit the labor of others to enjoy the "hygiene" of their own small world. They plunder the wealth of their own working people and plunder the fat of the colonial people to live a life of debauchery and shamelessness that they call "civilized." The broad masses of working people, however, live in unhygienic slums and suffer from hunger, cold, and disease. In just over a decade since our country's liberation, thanks to the great concern of the Party and Chairman Mao for the people, mass hygiene movements have been launched and great achievements have been made. A prosperous scene of "increased grain production and increased longevity" has appeared everywhere. In terms of hygiene work alone, it fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. This is something that can be taken as a great honor and pride.
    What hygiene habits should each of us develop? I think the basic requirements can be summarized in these few sentences: everyone should have a fly swatter, and eliminate pests wherever they are found; clean the environment frequently, and keep oneself tidy; do not spit everywhere, and do not eat unclean food; combine work with rest, and persevere in exercise.
    The four pests and unhygienic environments are the source of diseases, just as imperialism is the source of war. We cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest. If we do not eliminate them, they will invade us. Whether it is the elderly, children, youth, adults, teachers, students, men, or women, we must take action. Like in the current season, we should prepare fly swatters everywhere; wherever there are four pests, eliminate them there. In this way, with both surprise attacks and regular struggles, the four pests will not live long. Protecting environmental hygiene and achieving "three cleanlinesses and six purities" makes working and living here particularly pleasant. In addition, personal cleanliness cannot be ignored. Places like people's hands, fingernails, and hair are prone to hiding dirt, and sweat stains on the body are also conducive to the survival of bacteria, so wash your hands before meals, and trim your nails and take baths frequently. Also, the clothes we wear travel with us all day long, have a wide contact surface, and are stained with sweat, making them easily dirty. If we take off the clothes we have worn, they will grow mold in a few days. Mold is a group of bacteria, although mold will not cause disease, dirty clothes may also be contaminated with other disease-causing bacteria, so clothes should also be changed and washed frequently.
    We love labor and love the collective. We have the great spirit of transforming nature and reforming the world. Therefore, we must use our hands to repeatedly fight against the four pests and unhygienic environments, and create hygienic conditions from the struggle, rather than passively avoiding and escaping unhygienic environments. Not eliminating "pests" when we see them, covering our noses and passing by unclean things when we see them, and wearing white gloves to avoid touching dust is just a bourgeois master-style hygiene habit, which is fundamentally different from the hygiene habits we want to develop.
    In addition to this, we should also pay attention to daily healthcare and physical exercise to continuously strengthen our physical fitness, and attach importance to the principle of combining work with rest. In our spare time from work, we should widely carry out recreational and sports activities. According to the different physical conditions of each person, choose to participate in various sports activities such as gymnastics, playing ball, running, climbing, swimming, and practicing Tai Chi, and persevere in them for a long time. This is not only a good way to enhance our physical fitness and prevent various diseases, but also an active way to rest. Coupled with adequate sleep every day, it makes our physical strength sufficient and our spirits refreshed, giving us inexhaustible energy in production.

### 以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱

    以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱
    傅连璋
    谈到卫生，人们不禁要称赞我们美丽的首都——北京。你们看，夏季本来是一个苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、老鼠猖獗的季节，现在已经减少到接近消灭的程度了；夏季本来是一个胃肠道传染病多发的季节，现在这些疾病的发病率已经下降了许多。讲卫生已逐渐成为广大群众的一种日常习惯，成为经常性群众性有组织的行动。不仅北京如此，广东有个佛山市，人们动手把它从一个旧社会的破烂肮脏的城市，转变为一个整洁美丽的城市。山西有个稷山县，歼灭了四害，基本消灭和控制了几种危害人民健康的主要疾病，现在正向着灭绝四害，人寿年丰，普及较高的卫生科学知识，绿化、美化、香化环境等更高的目标前进。全国千千万万的城镇和农村，在取得除害灭病的胜利的基础上，又在“学佛山，赶佛山，超佛山”，“学稷山，赶稷山，超稷山”的口号下不断跃进。
    对于我们每个人来说，除了积极响应党的号召投入卫生运动而外，应该更高的树立起“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的新的道德风尚，养成爱卫生的习惯。
    讲卫生为什么是光荣，不讲卫生为什么是耻辱呢？或许有少数人认为只有工作好，生产好，学习好才是光荣，而卫生不卫生只是“小节”，是“无伤大雅”的事。不错，生产好，工作好，学习好是很光荣的，但讲究卫生也并不是什么“小节”，它也是大事，是移风易俗改造世界的大事。搞好了卫生有利于生产，有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于增进人民体质。佛山市卫生好，工厂职工因病缺勤的现象很少了，生产就搞得更好。稷山县是一个卫生红旗县，又是一个小麦丰产县，生产和卫生双双跃进，不是很光荣么！相反的，如果不讲卫生，影响了身体，也妨碍了生产、工作和学习，可以说是一件不光彩的事。
    养成个人卫生习惯，还是有益于集体的事。我们工作、学习和生活都是在群众集体之中，一个人不讲清洁，就会影响到周围的群众。比如随地吐痰，不仅使环境肮脏，如果是有呼吸道传染病的人的痰，还要把病菌带到空气中去，有把疾病传给旁人的危险。又如随便扔脏的东西，给细菌增加了孳生场所，又破坏了大家打扫的卫生环境。一个具有社会主义和共产主义道德品质的人，都会以爱护集体尊重群众劳动成果为光荣，而把那些有损群众利益的行为当作可耻的事。
    资本主义国家里的一些资产阶级代言人一向也夸耀他们的所谓“文明”、“卫生”。但是他们是怎样的货色呢？资本家们是以剥削人家的劳动来享受个人小天地的“卫生”，他们搜括本国劳动人民和掠夺殖民地人民的脂膏来过着荒淫无耻的所谓“文明生活”。而广大的劳动人民却生活在不卫生的贫民窟里受着饥寒和疾病的折磨。我国解放仅仅十年多的时间，由于党和毛主席对人民的伟大关怀，开展了群众性卫生运动，取得了巨大的成就，到处出现了“田增产，人增寿”的繁荣景象。仅就卫生工作一个方面，也充分显示了我们社会主义制度的无比优越性。这正是可以引为极大光荣和自豪的事。
    我们每个人应该养成哪一些卫生习惯呢？我想基本要求可以归纳为这样几句话：人人有蝇拍，有“害”就消灭；环境勤打扫，自身要整洁；不随地吐痰，不洁者不食；劳逸相结合，锻炼要坚持。
    四害和不卫生的环境是疾病的根源，就好像帝国主义是战争的根源一样，我们不能丝毫放松警惕，不消灭它们，它们就要侵袭我们。无论老人、小孩、青年、壮年、教师、学生、男子、女子都要行动起来，像现在的季节应该处处准备苍蝇拍；哪里有四害就把它消灭在哪里。这样既有突击性的运动，又有经常性的斗争，四害就活不长了。爱护环境卫生，做到“三光六净”，工作和生活在这里格外愉快。此外，个人整洁也不能忽视，像人的手、指甲、头发都是容易藏污纳垢的地方，身上的汗垢也有利于细菌的生存，所以饭前要洗手，要勤剪指甲勤洗澡。还有，穿的衣服成天随着我们旅行，接触面很广，又被汗水污渍，很容易弄脏，如果把穿过的衣服脱下来，不几天就会长霉，霉就是一些细菌的集团，虽然霉菌不会致病，但脏衣服上也可能沾染其它致病的细菌，所以衣服也应该勤换勤洗。
    我们是热爱劳动热爱集体的，我们具有改造自然改造世界的伟大气魄，因此要用我们的双手与四害和不卫生的环境进行反复斗争，从斗争中创造卫生条件，而不是消极的去避免和逃避不卫生的环境，见“害”不除，看见不洁的东西就掩鼻而过，带上白手套尘土不沾，那只是一种资产阶级老爷式的卫生习惯，与我们所要养成的卫生习惯是有根本区别的。
    除此而外，我们还要注意日常保健和体育锻炼，使我们的体质不断强壮，要重视有弛有张劳逸结合的原则。在我们工作之余要广泛开展文娱和体育活动。按照各人身体情况的不同，选择参加体操、打球、跑步、爬山、游泳、打太极拳等各式各样的体育活动，并且要长期坚持下去。这既是增强我们体质和预防各种疾病的好方法，也是一种积极的休息方式，再加上每天安适的睡眠，就使我们的体力充足，精神焕发，在生产上更有使不尽的干劲。
