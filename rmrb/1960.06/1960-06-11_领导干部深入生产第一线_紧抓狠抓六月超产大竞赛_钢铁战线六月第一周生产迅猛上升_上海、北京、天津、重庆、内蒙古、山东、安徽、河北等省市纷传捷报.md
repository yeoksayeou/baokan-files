Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th: In the June steel battle, Shanghai's iron and steel industry workers launched a heated production competition between furnaces, workshops, and factories. Advanced experiences were widely promoted on converters and cupolas, leading to a rapid increase in steel production. From the 1st to the 7th, the city's daily steel production level increased by more than 20% compared to the same period in May. The No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 saw their first-grade steel rate rise to around 90%. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has been reduced to below 1,170 kilograms, lower than the stipulated iron consumption target.

Leading cadres such as party committee secretaries and factory directors of various plants went to the front line of production, working and solving key production problems together with workers, and organizing the high-yield steel month competition. After the steel output of the No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 broke the 1,000-ton mark at the beginning of the month, the general branch secretary of the No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 personally led more than 20 people, including furnace chiefs and shift directors, to Plant No. 3 to learn from their experiences. After returning to the plant, they organized an operational performance competition to promote these experiences. In the first week of June, the steel output of this workshop steadily increased, with daily output exceeding the daily output level of late May.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: In Beijing, a number of factories in the metallurgical, coal, and cement industries saw their product output rise rapidly in the first week of June compared to the previous month.

In these seven days, the average daily output of pig iron at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company increased by 5.2% compared to the previous month, and steel output also increased. As soon as June arrived, the party committee secretary, manager, and secretaries and factory directors of all affiliated factories went to the production site. The director of the iron smelting plant discovered that the furnace condition was not good and immediately analyzed the reasons with the workers, changed the charging method, and quickly improved the furnace condition, leading to a steady increase in production.

The Jingxi Mining Bureau overfulfilled its raw coal production plan by 2,000 tons in the first week of June, exceeding the production level of the same period last month.

The employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant, which had completed its production plan for the first half of the year forty days ahead of schedule, overproduced more than 900 tons of cement from June 1st to 7th, with an average daily output increase of 5.14% compared to the previous month.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th: Tianjin's steelworkers have launched a steel-grabbing campaign, with the average daily production level from June 1st to 7th increasing by 8.26% compared to late May.

In order to achieve a high-yield month in June, recently more than 250 leading cadres from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, various district committees, and steel mills have gone to the front line of steelmaking, participating in production, inspecting production, and directing production. In carrying out the steel-grabbing campaign, the workers of various steel mills launched a new upsurge of learning from Tangshan, catching up with Shanghai, and doubling furnace lifespan for great overproduction, greatly accelerating the realization of production technology measures and the promotion of advanced experience. After the converter in the Second Steel Plant adopted new technology, the average smelting time per furnace was shortened by five minutes, and silicon iron consumption was reduced from 21 kilograms per furnace to 8 kilograms.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th: In the first week of June, Chongqing's industry achieved a substantial increase in production. Compared with the same period in May, the total value of industrial production increased by 15.25%, steel production increased by 22.33%, steel output increased by 69.59%, and the output of major products such as power generation, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth increased by 17.31% to 28% respectively.

Recently, an important feature of industrial production in Chongqing is that the leading cadres of factories and mines have been going deep into the grassroots to cultivate experimental plots, eating, living, and working with the workers, grasping production problems very tightly and promptly. At the beginning of June, the party committee secretary and administrative leaders of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant went deep into the furnace side to "set up camp", taking turns working in two shifts to grasp the work to the end, so that some weak links in production were quickly broken through. The well leaders of Yutianpu Coal Mine moved to work underground, directly going to production to direct and dispatch, while strengthening group management, so that the coal output from the 1st to the 7th increased by 7.1% compared with the same period last month. Many units have also vigorously engaged in diversified operations, comprehensive utilization of raw materials and materials, and conservation and substitution, ensuring the needs of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 10th: The workers of all ethnic groups on the industrial front in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved new results in the first production week of June. The output of steel and steel products has greatly exceeded the output of the same period in May, with steel increasing by 85%, iron increasing by 1.5%, and steel products increasing by 11.3%.

The employees of Baotou Steel No. 1 open hearth furnace vigorously attacked key production areas such as batching, thermal engineering, furnace repair, and furnace maintenance. Close cooperation between various processes has continuously improved productivity. The average daily production level from the 1st to the 6th increased by 338% compared to the same period in May. The utilization coefficient has increased, and the quality has fully met national standards.

Since May, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee has transferred more than 16,000 cadres from various directly affiliated agencies and relevant departments of various leagues and cities to form a "10,000-person work group" to work in various factories and mines. Su Qianyi, secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee Secretariat, alternate secretary Quan Xingyuan, and heads of various ministries, commissions, and bureaus personally went to the production site to fight alongside the workers. Recently, the newly built steel "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" in grassland pastoral areas, vast rural areas, and towns have also made huge contributions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province, one of China's major iron-producing provinces, saw its average daily pig iron production surge to more than 8,700 tons in the first week of June, breaking the 10,000-ton mark on the 3rd. The average daily production level for these seven days increased by more than 18% compared to late May.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and relevant departments have further strengthened their leadership over the iron and steel front. While educating the masses to establish a continuous leap forward ideology and muster greater effort, party committees at all levels have led cadres to go deep into the front line of production, working in shifts day and night, and solving specific problems in production together with the masses. After overcoming complacency, the Changwei area quickly leaped from a daily pig iron output of more than 1,200 tons to more than 1,500 tons, 1,800 tons, and even broke through 2,000 tons.

The province's iron and steel workers also launched a competition movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, learning, comparing, catching up, and helping each other, conscientiously promoting advanced experience, and universally carrying out technical transformations to blast furnace equipment; at the same time, the province also improved the furnace opening rate, and the total volume of blast furnaces put into production in the province increased from about 5,000 cubic meters not long ago to the current 5,600+ cubic meters.

The continuous leap forward in coal, coke, and ore production in Shandong Province has created favorable conditions for blast furnace production. After the province's coal workers created a new record of 100,000 tons of coal per day, coke production continued to rise to the level of 30,000 tons for six consecutive days, greatly exceeding the target of 20,000 tons per day.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th: In the first week of June, Anhui Province saw significant increases in the daily output and quality of steel, iron, and coal throughout the province compared to late May, with daily steel output increasing by 6.01%, iron increasing by 2.85%, steel products increasing by 23.12%, and coal increasing by 2.7%.

In order to achieve a comprehensive surge in production in June, the provincial party committee's industrial secretary and the first secretaries of various municipal party committees concentrated their efforts on personally grasping the production and transportation of steel, iron, coal, and ore, going to the front line of production to understand and solve problems in production. Therefore, the production and transportation of coal and ore in the province has gradually been able to adapt to the requirements of a large increase in steel. Many steel mills have also carried out equipment maintenance work. In addition to grasping production, leaders at all levels have also focused on ideological education for cadres and employees and arranged for employee life.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th: A great situation has emerged in the production of steel, iron, coal, and ore in Hebei Province. In the first week of June, the average daily production level of iron in the province increased by 6.6% compared to May; steel production soared even higher, and from the 1st to the 8th, the average daily production of steel in the province increased sharply by 32.8% compared to late May; ore production also increased significantly.

In June, this crucial month, steel, iron, coal, and ore production enterprises in Hebei Province combined the current key points in production to promote major advanced experiences with a decisive impact, break through weak links, and make production levels rise steadily. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production to specifically lead production and solve problems in production in a timely manner. For example, Cai Zhijie, deputy mayor of Handan City, went deep into the Xingtai Iron Smelting Plant to cultivate an "experimental plot," summarize and promote advanced experience, encourage the enthusiasm of employees, and promote the rise in pig iron production.
