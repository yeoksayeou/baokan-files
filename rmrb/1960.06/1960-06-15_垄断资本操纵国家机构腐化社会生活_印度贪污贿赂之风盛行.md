Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 14th: The Indian weekly "Delhi Times" published an article on May 22nd entitled "Some Disturbing Trends in National Life; How the Tide of Monopoly Corrupts People's Lives," exposing the prevalence of corruption in India.

    The article said that corruption is devouring every very important aspect of Indian national life. Countless methods of corruption are prevalent.

    The article pointed out that, generally speaking, there are two types of corruption prevalent in society today. One involves lower-level officials, etc., who rely on their official positions to take disgraceful actions in return for some illegal favors.

    The other is that large financial entrepreneurs, in order to obtain greater profits, place large bets, take out large sums of money, and drag high-ranking bureaucrats into their sphere of influence.

    Every Seth (person's name, here representing big capitalists) has a large number of agents or employees to maintain contact with relevant officials, hold lavish banquets, invite them to movies, plays, travel, give them Seth's cars for their private use, and lend them "loans" that do not need to be repaid—if not outright bribery—and give gifts when weddings or other occasions are held.

    The article said that everyone knows these agents, contacts, and employees, and also knows that their bribery activities are increasing. There is no law or institution that can stop their activities.

    The article said that if a poor person accepts even ten rupees when he is weak, he will be dealt with by the department and even dismissed. But when a big capitalist's selfish, anti-social interests require him to bribe people, he bribes with thousands of rupees and will not be caught.

    The article believes that if an official with conscience and integrity disobeys a certain monopoly capitalist, then he can only continue to do so at serious risk.

### 垄断资本操纵国家机构腐化社会生活  印度贪污贿赂之风盛行

    垄断资本操纵国家机构腐化社会生活
    印度贪污贿赂之风盛行
    据新华社14日讯　新德里消息：印度“德里时代”周报5月22日发表一篇题为“国家生活里的一些令人不安的倾向；垄断的潮流如何腐化了人民的生活”的文章，揭露印度贪污盛行的情况。
    文章说，贪污正在吞嚼着印度国家生活的各个非常重要的方面。有无数的贪污的方法在盛行。
    文章指出，总的说来，在今天社会上盛行着两种贪污方式。一种涉及较低级的官员等，这些人依靠官职为了报答一些非法的恩赐，采取了一些不体面的行动。
    另一种方式是大金融企业家为了获得更大的利润，赌注下得很大，拿出大笔钱，把大官僚拖入他们的势力范围。
    每个塞特（人名，此处代表大资本家）有一大批代理人或雇员来同有关官员保持联系，举行豪华的宴会，请他们看电影、看戏、旅行，给他们塞特的汽车作为他们私人使用，借给他们不用归还的“贷款”——如果不是公开贿赂的话——在举行婚礼或其他场合时送礼。
    文章说，人人都知道这些代理人、联络和雇员，也知道他们的行贿活动愈来愈多。没有法律或机构可以阻止他们活动。
    文章说，如果一个穷人在软弱的时候甚至接受十个卢比就会受到部门处理，甚至被解雇。可是当一个大资本家的自私、反社会的利益要求他贿赂人时，他拿成千卢比来行贿，而不会被逮住。
    文章认为，如果一个有良心和正直的官员不服从某一个垄断资本家，那么他只能够冒严重的危险继续这样做。
