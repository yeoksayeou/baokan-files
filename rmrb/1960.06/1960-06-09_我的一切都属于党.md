    Everything I Have Belongs to the Party
    Gong Meizhen, Teacher at Qingshanqiao Elementary School, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province
    My name is Gong Meizhen, and I am an elementary school teacher from Qingshanqiao Commune in Xiangtan County. I am already very honored to be able to attend this conference. The conference has also asked me to speak, but I really don't have much to say. What I really want to say is that the Party saved me, the Party gave me a second life, and everything I have belongs to the Party.
    When I was three years old, my father was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang and disappeared without a trace. At that time, there were my elderly grandparents, an older sister who was a little over a year older than me, and an unborn younger brother at home. The family was too poor, so my mother had to work as a maid at a landlord's house to earn some money to support our family of five. At that time, in the freezing cold weather, I only had one pair of thin pants to get through the winter, and on New Year's Eve, we couldn't even eat our fill of radish for the reunion dinner. Because we were poor, I didn't start school until I was ten years old, and I had already started working at the age of six or seven, pulling grass and watering vegetables with my grandfather, and cutting firewood on the mountain at the age of eight or nine, then carrying it to Huaqiao Town to sell, selling it for a little money to help my mother supplement the family income. But even though our whole family, old and young, worked, life was still very hard, worrying about the next meal after finishing the current one.
    After liberation, my mother entered the Xiangtan City Electric Textile Mill and became a textile worker. Our life gradually improved, and she sent me to school. At school, I was among the first to join the Young Pioneers, and in the sixth grade, I was approved to join the Communist Youth League. I loved listening to stories and reading extracurricular books. The stories of heroes like Liu Hulan, Zhao Yiman, Huang Jiguang, and Luo Shengjiao, I listened to them again and again; the books introducing their deeds, I read them one after another. Their heroic deeds often moved me to tears, and I resolved to learn from them.

    Learn when you don't understand, as long as you are determined and willing to work hard, any difficulties can be overcome
    In 1956, I graduated from senior elementary school, but missed the middle school entrance exam period, so I entered the Xiangtan City Yiwen Junior Middle School Remedial School to study. In the winter of 1957, I responded to the call of the Party and the government and returned to the countryside to participate in production. Although some neighbors poured cold water on me, saying, "Instead of studying in the city, you've come to the countryside to play in the mud, you're not going to amount to anything." But the Party Secretary said to me, "Meizhen, the countryside needs you." So, the day after returning to the countryside, I went to work with everyone to carry mud, and on the third day, I joined the Youth Shock Brigade. One day, when I was working hard with everyone, the Township Party Committee and the Branch Secretary came to talk to me. They said that the whole township was engaged in large-scale people-run education and needed me to teach at the Shimen People-Run Senior Elementary School. I thought to myself, I had only studied junior middle school for one year, how could I teach senior elementary school? Besides, I was doing quite well in the Youth Shock Brigade, and I was reluctant to leave everyone. The Party Branch Secretary smiled and said to me, "You're doing well in the Shock Brigade, but if the school is set up, what will happen if there are no teachers? If your cultural level is not high, you can teach and learn at the same time. You should consider it from the overall needs." After he said this, I happily accepted the task of becoming a teacher. When I first became a teacher, there were indeed many difficulties. When I walked into the classroom and saw that some students were even taller than me, I felt flustered, and my voice always trembled when I spoke, not to mention preparing lessons and making teaching plans. What should I do? Should I give up? No! The Party teaches us: learn when you don't understand, as long as you are determined and willing to work hard, any difficulties can be overcome. First, I asked the older teachers for advice, learning from them how to prepare lessons, how to organize classroom teaching, and after preparing the lessons, I first asked the older teachers for their opinions, and then brought them back to revise. Sometimes, in the deep of night, I closed the door and rehearsed the lessons myself, until I had memorized the text and the lesson plan, before I felt comfortable going to sleep. Gradually, I figured out some tricks. Although the students were a bit naughty, I loved them. After class, I played games with them, told them stories, ate together, and slept together. In this way, many students sometimes didn't call me Teacher Gong, but affectionately called me older sister.

    "Even if I burn to ashes, I must save the students"
    In 1958, during the mass steelmaking campaign, I and my students participated. It was on October 19th that I led my students to transport nan bamboo from Xialing to the Wushi construction site, a distance of seventy li. When we arrived, it was already 11 o'clock in the evening, and the children were very tired. After the teachers and I settled them down to sleep, three female students, Xiao Xuemei, Xiao Yuejiao, and Zeng Liyun, followed me to live in the storage room of the headquarters. They fell asleep as soon as they lay down on the bed. I talked to several cadres about steelmaking. After they left, I was turning around to help the students cover their quilts when I saw that the rightist element who was working as an accountant threw a cigarette butt into a barrel containing over a hundred jin of explosives. Suddenly, behind me, there was a loud "boom," and I saw black smoke billowing and sparks flying everywhere. I didn't know what had happened, so I shouted fire while rushing to the door. Suddenly, I remembered that there were three students in bed, and they were screaming in the smoke and fire. "Saving the students is the most important thing, even if I burn to ashes, I must save the students!" I turned around and rushed into the fire, feeling for the students. At this time, the fire rushed to the roof, the walls collapsed, and the whole house became a sea of fire. The smoke was so thick that I couldn't see anything. The smoke blocked the way out, so I threw myself on top of them, tightly covering them. In the blink of an eye, the fire started burning on me, burning my hair, burning my clothes, burning my head, burning my hands, feet, and back. My whole body felt like boiling water was being poured on me, like sharp knives were scraping me. The sky was spinning, and the ground was turning. No matter how the sky spun and the ground turned, I tightly closed my eyes and clenched my teeth, refusing to move an inch. At this time, I was dominated by only one belief: sacrifice myself to save the students, use one life to protect three lives. The fire continued to burn on me, and I gradually lost consciousness and passed out.
    When I woke up, I was dazed, and the three students I was lying on top of were gone. There were many people surrounding me. I asked them anxiously, "Where are my students?" They told me that all three students had been safely rescued, and I was relieved, but then I passed out again. When I woke up for the second time, I didn't know where I was. I only saw some people wearing white clothes, and vaguely thought they were doctors and nurses. They told me that the Commune Party Committee had sent me to the Special District People's Hospital that night. Xiao Xuemei and Zeng Liyun had suffered minor injuries and were staying in the same room with me. But I didn't see Xiao Yuejiao. The nurse told me that Xiao Yuejiao was not burned and was not admitted to the hospital. I was not very clear-headed at the time, and I believed it. A long time later, a comrade from the Commune came to see me and told me the news that Xiao Yuejiao had been burned to death. The fire burned me, and I didn't cry, but when I heard that classmate Xiao Yuejiao had been taken away by the fire, I cried, and I regretted that I hadn't realized at the time that I was only covering two students and that caused classmate Xiao Yuejiao to be burned to death. I didn't fulfill my responsibility.

    The Party's kindness is truly as high as the heavens and as deep as the earth
    Saving the students is something a people's teacher should do. But the Party's kindness to me is truly as high as the heavens and as deep as the earth! After I was burned, it took almost half a month to fully regain consciousness. My mother and comrades told me that as soon as I entered the hospital, the hospital's Party Branch immediately mobilized many medical staff to rescue me, and many comrades competed to donate blood for me. Minister Ma and Deputy Minister Liu of the County Party Committee Propaganda Department, comrades from the Education Section, the Commune Party Committee, the teachers of the school, and some commune members all came to see me and brought a lot of nutritional products. The leading comrades of the County Party Committee repeatedly instructed the hospital: "As long as Gong Meizhen is cured, there will be money for money, blood for blood, and skin for skin." Dean He of the hospital personally guarded my ward day and night during the days when I was severely comatose. My mother shed tears as she spoke. She said, "Meizhen, you were saved by the Party. You don't have anything that doesn't belong to the Party. You must remember this!" The Party saved me, the Party gave me a second life, how can I forget it? I will always remember the Party's kindness.

    After I fully regained consciousness, the wounds all over my body began to hurt greatly, like knives cutting at my heart. I really wanted to moan loudly, but I immediately thought that this would only increase the worries of the medical staff and the anxiety of the comrades. When I couldn't bear it, the thought of the Party's care for me added to my strength to fight against the pain. My two students were always shouting loudly in pain. Hearing these voices, I felt very sad, and I hoped that I could add their pain to my own body. I constantly encouraged them: use a tenacious will to fight against the pain. Sometimes the students naively asked me: "Teacher Gong! Does it hurt?" I smiled and answered: "It hurts a little bit, if you endure some when it hurts, it won't hurt." These two children are so lovely. After listening to my words, they never shouted loudly in pain again. Their progress made me feel particularly happy and reduced my own pain.

    After more than three months of treatment, I was able to get out of bed and move around. While I was staying in the hospital, I only wanted to be discharged as soon as possible. A month, two months passed, and the longer I stayed in the hospital, the more anxious I became. One victory after another in the mass steelmaking, large-scale water conservancy construction, and large-scale spring plowing production came, and I couldn't wait to fly back to my school, back to my commune, back to the children. I looked for the doctors and the dean every day. Later, they couldn't persuade me, so they had to let me leave the hospital early. When I returned to the commune, the Commune Party Committee insisted that I continue to recuperate. How could I stay idle? So, I pestered the Commune Party Committee left and right, and they finally allowed me to go to Longwutou Elementary School to recuperate while doing some work.

    Deeply realized the glory of being a people's teacher
    When I returned to the children's side, I loved the children I hadn't seen for a long time even more. The children were also very sensible. Sometimes when I felt so dizzy that I slumped on the podium, the classroom would become even quieter. Even the naughtiest Zhang Lichen was well-behaved. The children cared about my health, some gave me eggs, some gave me fish and shrimp. Sometimes, when I opened a drawer, there would be something to eat that had been stuffed in there at some point. The children also made particularly rapid progress in their studies. Every bit of their progress strengthened my courage and confidence in fighting against difficulties, and I deeply realized the glory and pride of being a people's teacher.

    Although I had resumed work, I had to leave the school several times in the middle of the term to recuperate because the wound sometimes recurred. I have only been working in education for two years, and treatment and recuperation have taken up one year. I really haven't done anything for the Party. But the Party's care and cultivation for me is meticulous. In order to continue my treatment, they have contacted the most famous large hospitals in China, such as Wuhan Medical College, Hunan Medical College, Shanghai Guangci Hospital, and Beijing Chinese Academy of Sciences Plastic Surgery Hospital, and they have all received enthusiastic responses and help.

    The Party has not only given me a second life, but also educated me and clarified how I should live. Last August, I was honorably admitted to the Communist Party of China. From then on, I have more clearly found the direction forward and am determined to dedicate my entire life to the cause of communism.

### 我的一切都属于党

    我的一切都属于党
    湖南省湘潭县青山桥小学教师　龚梅珍
    我叫龚梅珍，是湘潭县青山桥公社的小学教师。我能够参加这次大会，已经是很荣幸了。大会还叫我发言，实在是没有什么可说的。我真正要说的是党救活了我，是党给了我第二次生命，我的一切都是属于党的。
    当我三岁的时候，父亲被国民党抓去当壮丁，杳无音信。当时家里有年老的祖父祖母，一个比我大一岁多的姐姐，还有一个未出生的弟弟。家里太穷，没办法，妈妈只好到地主家做女工，挣点钱回来，养活我们一家五口人。那时候，寒天冷冻，我只有一条单裤子过冬，大年三十夜吃团年饭，连萝卜也没有饱的吃。由于穷，我十岁了还没有开始读书，并且早在六、七岁时就参加了劳动，跟祖父扯草、淋菜，八、九岁上山砍柴，然后挑到花桥镇上去卖，卖点钱帮助妈妈补贴家用。可是尽管我们一家老的小的都劳动，但生活还是很苦，吃上餐、愁下餐的。
    解放以后，妈妈进了湘潭市电机织布厂当上了纺织工人，生活便逐步好起来了，于是才送我进学校。在学校里，我第一批加入了少先队，在六年级时，又被批准加入了共青团。我最喜欢听故事，又爱读课外读物，像刘胡兰、赵一曼、黄继光、罗盛教这些英雄的故事，我是听了一遍又一遍；关于介绍他们事迹的书本，读了一本又一本，他们的英雄事迹，常使我感动得流泪，我决心要向他们学习。
    不懂就学，只要有决心肯努力，什么困难都能克服
    1956年，我在高小毕业了，没有赶上中学考期，就进了湘潭市翊文初中补习学校学习。1957年冬天，我响应党和政府的号召，回到了农村参加生产，虽然左邻右舍有的泼我的冷水，他们说：“不在城里读书，反跑到乡里来玩泥，没出息。”但是党委书记对我说：“梅珍，农村正需要你。”所以我在回农村的第二天，就和大家出工担泥，第三天，我就参加青年突击队。有一天，我和大伙正在干得热火朝天的时候，乡党委和社支书来找我谈话，他们说，全乡大搞民办教育，需要我到石门民办高小去教课。我想自己初中才读一年，怎么能教高小？再说，我在青年突击队干得蛮好的，舍不得离开大家。党支书笑着对我说：“你在突击队里干得好，但是，学校办起来了，没有教师怎么办？文化不高，可以边教边学，应该从整个的需要来考虑。”经他这一说，我便愉快地接受了当教师的任务。初当教师，困难的确是很多的，一走进教室，看到有些学生比自己还高大，心里就发慌，讲话时老是打颤，更不用说备课，订教学计划了。怎么办呢？难道就打退堂鼓吗，不！党教导我们：不懂就学，只要有决心肯努力，什么困难都可以克服。我首先向老教师请教，向他们学习备课，学习如何组织课堂教学，备好了课先请老教师提出意见，又拿回来修改。有时在夜深人静时闭上房门，自己一个人进行试教，直到课文背熟教案记熟了，才放心睡觉，慢慢的摸出了一些门路，学生虽然有些淘气，可是我爱他们，课后，我就和他们一起做游戏，讲故事，吃饭在一起，睡觉在一起。这样，很多学生有时不叫我龚老师，而亲切地叫我做姐姐。
    “即使自己烧成灰，也要救护学生”
    1958年全民大炼钢铁运动，我和同学们都参加了。正是10月19日这一天，我带学生从霞岭运楠竹到乌石工地，七十里路，走到那里，已经是晚上十一点了，孩子们很疲倦。我和老师们安置他们睡了以后，其中萧雪梅、萧月姣、曾利云三个女同学，跟我到指挥部的保管室里住，她们倒在床上就睡着了。我和几个干部谈了一些炼钢铁的事情。他们出去了。我正转身帮学生盖被子，那知道那个担任会计的留用右派分子，扔了一个烟蒂子到一桶百多斤重的炸药里。突然在我的背后，“轰”的一声巨响，只见黑烟滚滚，火花四射，我不知道出了什么事，一边喊救火一边冲到门口，突然想起床上还有三个学生，她们在烟火里正尖声叫喊。“救学生要紧，即使自己烧成灰，也要救护住学生！”我转身向火里冲，摸到了学生。这时，火冲到了屋顶，墙壁也冲垮了，整个房子成了火海，烟火熏得什么也看不见，烟封住了出路，我便扑在她们身上，紧紧地把她们盖住。一眨眼，火就在我的身上烧起来，火，烧着我的头发，烧着我的衣服，烧着我的头，烧着我的手、脚和背，满身像滚水在淋，像尖刀子在剐，天在旋，地在转，不管天旋地转，我死死地闭住眼睛，咬紧牙关，终不肯移动一下子。这时，只有一个信念支配着我：牺牲自己，救住学生，用一条生命保护三条生命。火在我身上继续燃烧，我渐渐失去知觉昏迷过去了。
    当我醒来，迷迷糊糊，我伏着的三个学生不见了。周围有很多人围着我，我很着急的问他们，“我的学生呢？”他们告诉我，三个学生都安全的救出来了，我才放了心，可是一下子又昏迷了过去。当我第二次苏醒过来的时候，不知道自己躺在什么地方了，只看到一些穿白衣服的，迷迷糊糊地想到这是医生和护士。他们告诉我，是当晚，公社党委把我送到专区人民医院来的。萧雪梅、曾利云受了轻伤，跟我住在一间房里。但独没有看见萧月姣。护士告诉我，萧月姣没有烧伤，她没有进医院。我那时还不大清醒，也信以为真，过后很久，公社的一个同志来看我，他把萧月姣被烧死的消息告诉了我，火烧我，我不曾哭，可是当我听到萧月姣同学被火夺去了她的生命，我哭了，而且我后悔当时没有发觉自己只盖着两个学生而使萧月姣同学被火烧死。我，没有尽到自己的责任。
    党的恩情真是天高地厚
    我救学生是一个人民教师应该做的事。可是党对我的恩情，真是天高地厚！我烧伤以后，差不多有半个月，才完全恢复知觉。妈妈和同志们告诉我，当我一进医院，医院的党支部立即动员许多医护人员进行抢救，许多的同志争着要替我输血，县委宣传部马部长、刘副部长、教育科的同志，公社党委、学校的老师，还有一些社员，都来看我，还送了不少营养品。县委领导同志一再指示医院：“只要治好龚梅珍，要钱有钱，要血有血，要皮有皮。”医院的何院长，在我昏迷得厉害的那几天，日日夜夜，亲自守护在我的病房。妈妈边说边流下了眼泪。她说：“梅珍，你是党救活的，你没有哪点不是属于党的，你要记住呵！”党救活了我，党给了我第二生命，我哪能忘记呢，我要永远记住党的恩情。
    我完全恢复知觉以后，全身的伤口，开始大痛起来，像刀在心上割，我很想大声的呻吟几声，可是马上想到这样只能增加医护人员的担心和同志们着急，在忍受不住时，一想到党对我的关怀，我就增添了与痛苦作斗争的力量。我的两个学生，总是痛得大喊大叫，听到这声音，我心里非常难过，我希望能把她两个的痛苦加到我身上。我不断的鼓励她们：要用顽强的意志向痛苦作斗争。有时学生天真的问我：“龚老师！你痛不痛？”我笑着回答：“痛是有点点，痛时忍住一些，就不会痛。”这两个孩子多可爱，听了我的话，以后，她们再也不尖声地喊痛了，她们的进步，使我感到特别高兴，也减轻了自己的痛苦。
    经过三个多月的治疗，我已经能够下床移动了。我在医院里住着，心里只想能快点出院。一个月、两个月过去了，住院的时间越长，心就越急。大炼钢铁、大修水利、大闹春耕生产一连串的胜利消息传来，我恨不得一下子就飞回我的学校，飞回我的公社，回到孩子们身边去。我天天找医师，找院长，后来他们没办法说服我，只好让我提早出院了。回到公社，公社党委一定要我继续休养，我怎能闲得住呢？又找公社党委左缠右缠，他们才允许我到龙午头小学一边休养，一边担任少部分工作。
    深深体会到人民教师的光荣
    我回到孩子们的身边，好久不见的孩子们，我更疼爱他们。孩子们也非常懂事，有时我头晕得不行，往讲台上一伏，教室里就更加肃静起来。连那最淘气的张利臣，也都规规矩矩的了。孩子们关心我的健康，有的给我送鸡蛋，有的给我送鱼虾，有时，我把抽屉一打开，里面不知在什么时候，又塞了吃的东西。孩子们在学习上进步也特别快。他们的每一点进步都使我增强了对困难作斗争的勇气和信心，我深深体会到一个人民教师的光荣和自豪。
    我虽然是恢复了工作，但因为伤口有时复发，不得不中途几次离开学校去休养。我参加教育工作仅两年，治伤和休养就占了一年，我实在没有为党做什么。而党对我的关怀和培养是无微不至的。为了给我继续治疗，又先后与武汉医学院、湖南医学院、上海广慈医院、北京中国科学院整形外科医院等国内最有名的大医院联系，而且都得到了他们热情的答复和帮助。
    党不仅给了我第二次生命，而且教育我明确了应该怎样去生活。去年8月，我光荣地被吸收参加了中国共产党，从此，我更加明确地找到了前进的方向，决心把我整个生命都献给共产主义的事业。
