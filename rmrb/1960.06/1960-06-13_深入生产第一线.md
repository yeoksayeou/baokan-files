    Not long ago, the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee in Guangdong Province made a decision requiring leading cadres of the Prefectural Committee to spend five months of each year at the grassroots level. County-level offices should move to lower levels, and the vast majority of leading cadres of the County Committee should spend seven months of each year living in communes, factories, and mines. It was also required that cadres at all levels, when going to the grassroots, should first go to backward areas and units; and that all cadres going down to the countryside and factories should eat, live, and participate in labor alongside the masses. Now, all eight secretaries of the Shantou Prefectural Committee have moved and settled down in communes or factories and mines in Jieyang, Meixian, Dabu, Haifeng, and other counties. Over 90% of the County Committee secretaries and over 80% of the County Committee members and Commune Party secretaries in the entire region have moved out of their offices and gone deep into the forefront of production. This decision by the Shantou Prefectural Committee and their resolute actions demonstrate their magnificent spirit and firm determination to further improve their leadership style. What they are doing is completely correct. This will powerfully promote current production and facilitate the realization of a sustained leap forward, and is worthy of great advocacy.
    Leading cadres leaving their offices and going to the forefront of production is not simply a matter of changing the location of command; it is a major principle of upholding the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership style and leadership methods. What is the forefront of production? The forefront of production is the site of production and construction, the place where the broad masses struggle and engage in activities, and the basic-level unit where the Party's policies are specifically implemented and various production tasks are accomplished. For leading cadres to go to the forefront of production means to go deep into the site, deep into the grassroots, to go deep into reality and deep into the masses. Only by going deep into reality can we make the subjective conform to the objective, proceed from reality, and thus avoid subjectivism. Only by going deep into the masses can we combine leadership with the masses, and thus avoid bureaucracy. This materialist leadership method and mass line leadership style are the fine traditions of our Party. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly called on all Party cadres to serve the people wholeheartedly and never be divorced from the masses for a moment; they must go among the masses, go into the fiery struggle, participate in production to lead production, and participate in struggle to lead struggle. Leading cadres going deep into the forefront of production is an important measure to implement Mao Zedong Thought and uphold the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership style and leadership methods. We did this in the past revolutionary struggles, and therefore won the great victory of the revolution. Since 1958, the Party's leadership organs and leading cadres at all levels have continued to uphold this fine tradition, and have created methods of experimental plots, establishing command plots, holding on-site meetings, organizing visits and comparisons, and implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and other Marxist leadership methods. This is one of the most important factors in our ability to achieve a continuous leap forward for two years.
    At present, we are facing a great situation of continued comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. The new situation requires that our leadership work must be done more specifically, more meticulously, more practically, and more comprehensively. How can we achieve this? Leading cadres must go to the forefront of production! Going to the forefront of production will enable leadership work to better adapt to the development of the situation, understand the situation in a timely and specific manner, arrange various specific measures meticulously and thoroughly, and solve problems practically and effectively, solving problems as soon as they arise, rather than letting them pile up before addressing them. In this new situation of rapid daily progress, if leading cadres do not personally go to the forefront of the masses' struggle, but only sit in their offices to hold meetings, listen to reports, read reports and statistics, and rely solely on second-hand and third-hand indirect materials to understand the situation and guide work, they cannot help but fall behind the production movement.
    Going to the forefront of production means going to advanced areas, promptly summarizing advanced experiences, and promptly promoting advanced experiences; at the same time, it also means using even greater efforts to go to places with the most difficulties and the worst conditions, to focus on the backward and the weak links. This is very important for achieving a sustained leap forward. The comrades in the Shantou area are doing just that. The decision of the Shantou Prefectural Committee clearly pointed out that "leading cadres at all levels should go deep into the grassroots, first going deep into backward communes, backward production teams, backward factories and mines, and backward workshops, to help the cadres of backward areas and units, specifically analyze the situation, promptly identify problems, solve problems, thoroughly change the backward situation, and promote the comprehensive and balanced development of all tasks." Luo Tian, the First Secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Committee, and others went deep into a backward point in the Paotai Commune in Jieyang County, and managed to cultivate high-yield plots in over 10,000 mu of backward land. Leading cadres in Wuhua County are currently all going deep into backward areas to strengthen leadership and assume full responsibility. The facts in many places tell us that wherever the leading organs and leading cadres are determined to focus on the backward and the weak links, the production and work situation there will change dramatically. The Mianyang Prefectural Committee of Sichuan and the secretaries of the county committees in this area in charge of industry went deep into the long-term low-yield hundred-ton furnace groups to work, which enabled the hundred-ton furnace groups in the entire prefecture to quickly break through the level of producing one hundred tons of iron per day. This shows the enormous power of the Party's leadership style and leadership methods of closely linking with reality and linking with the masses!
    Now, cadres of leading organs at all levels going deep into the forefront of production has developed into a common action. All those who have done so have achieved good results. However, the situation in various places is still uneven, and some regions, some departments, and some cadres have not done enough. This is either because of insufficient understanding of going deep into the forefront of production, or because of a lack of proper specific arrangements. Party organizations should strengthen political and ideological work, and at the same time help them make arrangements. For example, some comrades feel that they are too busy with work and can only stay in the office for a long time, without time to go to the forefront of production. These comrades should be told that it is true that work is busy, but Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs are to understand the situation and grasp policies." May I ask, how can we do these two major things and truly promote production without going deep into the practice of production to investigate and study, without going deep among the masses to discuss problems and solve problems with them? Is there any other task more important than this "basic task"? Moreover, the responsible cadres of the leading organs go deep into the site, which not only provides timely guidance for current work, but also strengthens the connection with basic-level cadres and the broad masses, which can greatly reduce the number of low-quality meetings, reduce unnecessary reports, and reduce excessive paperwork, thereby saving more manpower and time to engage in more practical and effective work. Therefore, to go deep into the forefront of production, there is time, the question is whether there is determination. Some comrades consider: if they only focus on points when they go down, will they neglect the guidance of the whole? In fact, as long as we adhere to Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership method of combining the individual and the general, we will not only not weaken the guidance of the whole, but will only strengthen the guidance of the whole. Because we dissect a sparrow precisely to understand the common laws of the physiological structure of all sparrows; we go deep into a point to understand the situation, summarize and create experience, precisely to guide the overall situation more practically rather than vaguely. "The secretary sleeps by the stove, one stove ignites ten thousand stoves," which just illustrates the relationship between point and surface. Some comrades also consider: will the responsible cadres of the leading organs going down in large numbers weaken collective leadership? With more people going down and fewer meetings, collective leadership seems to be "weakened." But collective leadership is by no means just a matter of holding meetings. Moreover, after leading cadres go down, they will never abandon the collective discussion and collective decision-making on major issues. This requires making appropriate arrangements and stipulating necessary systems. As long as the arrangements are good, collective leadership will be stronger and more effective. Because leading cadres often go deep into the grassroots and deep into the site, master more information, and gain a lot of practical experience, and then go through collective discussion to achieve "from the masses, to the masses, concentrate, persist," this makes collective leadership extremely rich, thereby better enriching and strengthening the specific leadership of practical work.
    Now the situation is very good, our production and construction indicators are advanced, and the enthusiasm of the masses is sufficient. The task of the leading organs and leading cadres at all levels is to go deep down, do more practical work, practically solve problems, and practically grasp measures to promote the high tide of production and construction to be higher than each other. We must be determined to go to the forefront of production, go wherever there is a problem, go wherever there is difficulty, and go wherever there is a weak link! Be a down-to-earth and truly progressive faction!

### 深入生产第一线

    深入生产第一线
    不久以前，中共广东汕头地委作出一个决定，要求地委领导干部每年应有五个月的时间到基层去，县委机关要搬到下面办公，绝大部分县委领导干部每年应有七个月的时间住在公社、厂矿；要求各级领导干部到基层去的时候首先应深入后进地区、后进单位；要求所有下乡下厂的干部和群众实行同吃同住，并参加一定的劳动。现在汕头地委的八个书记都已分别搬到揭阳、梅县、大埔、海丰等县的公社或者厂矿去安家落户了，全区各县已有90％以上的县委书记、80％以上的县委委员和公社党委书记搬出了办公室，深入到生产第一线。汕头地委的这个决定和他们采取的果断行动，表明他们进一步改进领导作风的雄伟气魄和坚强决心。他们做得完全正确。这样做必将有力地推动当前生产，促进持续跃进的实现，值得大大提倡。
    领导干部走出机关，到生产第一线去，这不是简单的指挥场所的变换问题，而是坚持党的马克思列宁主义的领导作风和领导方法的重大原则问题。什么是生产第一线？生产第一线就是生产建设的现场，是广大群众斗争和活动的地方，是具体贯彻党的方针政策、实现各项生产任务的基层单位。领导干部到生产第一线去，就是要深入现场，深入基层，就是要深入实际，深入群众。只有深入实际，才能使主观和客观相符合，做到从实际出发，从而避免主观主义。只有深入群众，才能使领导和群众相结合，从而避免官僚主义。这种唯物主义的领导方法和群众路线的领导作风，是我们党的优良传统。毛泽东同志一再号召全党干部全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；必须到群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，去参加生产领导生产，参加斗争领导斗争。领导干部深入生产第一线，正是贯彻毛泽东思想，坚持党的马克思列宁主义的领导作风和领导方法的一个重要措施。在过去的革命斗争中我们这样做了，因而赢得了革命的伟大胜利。1958年以来，党的各级领导机关和领导干部继续坚持了这种优良传统，并且创造了种试验田，建立指挥田，开现场会议，组织参观评比，实行跟班劳动和两参一改三结合等马克思主义的领导方法，这是我们能够连续两年实现大跃进的最重要的因素之一。
    目前我们面临的是社会主义建设继续全面跃进的大好局面。新的形势要求我们的领导工作必须做得更具体、更细致、更踏实、更全面。怎样才能做到这一点？领导干部到生产第一线去！到生产第一线去，就能使领导工作更好地适应形势的发展，及时具体地了解情况，细致深入地安排各种具体措施，切切实实地解决问题，有什么问题就马上解决什么，不使问题成了堆才去解决。在这一日千里的新形势下，领导干部不亲临群众斗争的第一线，只是坐在机关里开会、听汇报、看报告和统计数字，光靠第二手、第三手的间接材料来了解情况，指导工作，便不能不落在生产运动的后面。
    到生产第一线去，要到先进的地区，及时总结先进经验，及时推广先进经验；同时，还要用更大的力量到困难最多、条件最差的地方去，抓后进、抓薄弱环节。这一点对于实现持续跃进非常重要。汕头地区的同志们正是这样做的。汕头地委的决定中就明确指出，“各级领导干部深入基层，首先应深入后进公社、后进生产队、后进厂矿、后进车间，帮助后进地区、单位的干部，具体分析情况，及时发现问题，解决问题，彻底改变落后面貌，促进各项工作全面、平衡地发展。”汕头地委第一书记罗天等深入到揭阳县炮台公社的一个落后点，在一万多亩落后田中经营起高产片。五华县的领导干部目前全部都深入到落后地区去加强领导，包干负责。许多地方的事实告诉我们，哪里的领导机关和领导干部下定决心抓后进、抓薄弱环节，哪里的生产面貌和工作面貌便立竿见影地发生变化。四川绵阳地委和这个地区各县县委主管工业的书记，分别深入到长期低产的百吨炉群进行工作，就使全专区的百吨炉群迅速突破了日产百吨铁的水平。这说明了党的这种密切联系实际联系群众的领导作风和领导方法，具有何等巨大的威力！
    现在，各级领导机关干部深入生产第一线，已经发展成为普遍的行动。凡是这样做了的，都取得了良好的成果。但是各地的情况还不平衡，有的地区、有的部门、有的干部还做得不够。这或者因为对于深入生产第一线这件事认识不足，或者因为缺乏妥善的具体安排。党的组织应当加强政治思想工作，同时帮助他们做好安排。譬如，有的同志觉得工作太忙，只能长期关在办公室，没有时间到生产第一线去。应当告诉这些同志：工作忙是事实，但是毛泽东同志说过：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事”。请问，不深入到生产实际中去调查研究，不深入到群众中去同群众商量问题解决问题，又怎能做好这两件大事，真正促进生产呢？难道还有什么别的任务比这个“基本任务”更重要的么？而且领导机关的负责干部深入现场，既及时指导了当前工作，又密切了同基层干部和广大群众的联系，这样便能大大减少那种质量不高的会议，减少可有可无的报表，减少过多的文牍，从而节省出更多的人力和时间来从事更加切实有效的工作。因此，要深入生产第一线，时间是有的，问题在于有没有决心。有的同志考虑：下去只抓了点，是不是会忽视面的指导？其实，只要我们坚持毛泽东同志的个别和一般相结合的领导方法，不但不会削弱面的指导，而且只会加强面的指导。因为我们解剖一个麻雀，正是为了了解所有麻雀的生理构造的共同规律；我们深入一点去了解情况，总结和创造经验，正是为了更加切实地而不是空泛地指导全局。“书记睡到炉边去，一炉升火万炉红”，正好说明了点和面的关系。也有同志考虑：领导机关的负责干部纷纷下去，是不是会削弱集体领导？下去的人多了，开会的次数少了，集体领导似乎是“削弱”了。但是集体领导决不仅仅是一个开会的问题。何况领导干部下去以后，决不是放弃对重大问题的集体讨论和集体决定。这就需要作出适当安排，规定必要的制度。只要安排得好，集体领导就会更加坚强有力。因为领导干部经常深入基层、深入现场，掌握了更多的情况，取得了许多实践的经验，然后再经过集体讨论，做到“从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去”，这就使得集体领导极大地丰富起来，从而更好地充实了和加强了对实际工作的具体领导。
    现在形势很好，我们的生产建设的指标是先进的，群众的干劲是足的。各级领导机关领导干部的任务，就在于深入下去，多做实际工作，切切实实地解决问题，切切实实地大抓措施，促进生产建设的高潮一浪高过一浪。一定要下决心到生产第一线去，哪里有问题就到哪里去，哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里是薄弱环节就到哪里去！做一个脚踏实地的真正的促进派！
