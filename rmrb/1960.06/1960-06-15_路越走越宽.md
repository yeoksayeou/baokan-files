The road gets wider

On June 11th, this newspaper published news about textile enterprises in Shanghai, Qingdao and other places extensively using wild and miscellaneous fibers to weave cloth, as well as news about Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Fujian and other places collecting and processing wild fibers. Today, we are publishing news about textile industry departments across the country widely testing the use of wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving. Reading these news items is very pleasing. It inspires us that our road is very wide in terms of sources of textile industry raw materials.

In the past, the raw materials of China's textile industry were almost entirely taken from domestic fibers such as cotton, wool, hemp, and silk, with cotton being the main one. People used very little of wild and miscellaneous fibers, and those who did only used it to mix and weave burlap sacks. Therefore, over time, whenever people mentioned increasing textile raw materials, they always focused on domestic fibers, especially cotton. Cotton has many advantages, and people call it "white gold." It is now, and will continue to be, one of the main raw materials for China's textile industry. In recent years, China's cotton production has already increased significantly, and in the future, we must continue to expand cotton production to ensure the textile industry's growing need for cotton. However, cotton is not the only raw material for the textile industry. Moreover, for a country with such a large population as ours, relying solely on cotton and other domestic fibers to spin and weave cloth cannot quickly meet the people's growing need for clothing. We must open up new sources of textile raw materials, and wild and miscellaneous fibers are an important new source. China is vast and rich in resources, and there are wild and miscellaneous fibers available for utilization everywhere. According to current preliminary understanding, there are more than one hundred kinds of wild plants that can be used for textile purposes, among which cotton stalks, flax, apocynum, and stinging nettle have large yields. While vigorously increasing the production of cotton, hemp, wool, and silk, utilizing all available wild and miscellaneous fibers will greatly contribute to accelerating the development of China's textile industry.

Currently, the utilization of wild and miscellaneous fibers has become one of the important topics of technological revolution in textile enterprises across the country. Various localities have not only produced a large number of burlap sacks using wild and miscellaneous fibers, but also a large number of packaging fabrics and other fabrics. The serge, khaki, gabardine, and Yuejin cloth produced by the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Lushun using wild and miscellaneous fibers, as well as the white cloth, printed cloth, and colored cloth produced by cotton mills in Shaanxi Province using cotton stalks, equisetum, paper mulberry bark, and waste cotton, have all been praised by consumers. Of course, our work of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers on a large scale has just begun, and we do not have much experience yet. However, as people's understanding of wild and miscellaneous fibers continues to improve and the technological revolution continues to develop, our methods of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers will surely become more and more numerous and better and better. Now, our task is to vigorously support all efforts to utilize and process wild fibers, and to take effective measures to expand the scale of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers. Textile industry workers must continue to liberate their minds and improve their skills. Those who have not yet overcome the technical hurdles of degumming, spinning, and weaving wild and miscellaneous fibers must work hard to study and strive to overcome this difficulty as soon as possible; they must also strive to summarize, consolidate, and improve the technical experience of using wild and miscellaneous fibers. In terms of manufacturing burlap sacks, we should try our best to use wild and miscellaneous fibers entirely. In terms of spinning and weaving, we should gradually increase the proportion of wild and miscellaneous fibers in blended spinning, and continuously improve product quality. In short, in the utilization of wild and miscellaneous fibers, we should spin fine if we can, spin coarse if we cannot, wear if we can, and use if we cannot wear. We must have both soaring aspirations and a pragmatic spirit, constantly improving from coarse to fine, from low-level to high-level, persevering and making persistent efforts for a long time. We must not only utilize all available wild and miscellaneous fibers, but also utilize them very well.

The distribution of wild and miscellaneous fiber resources is sometimes concentrated and sometimes dispersed, and many of them are in deep mountains and remote areas. In order to continue to expand the scope of utilization of wild and miscellaneous fibers, it is necessary to organize forces to collect and perform preliminary processing (such as peeling, degumming, etc.). People's communes in various localities must give full play to their own advantages, rationally arrange labor, organize the masses to go up the mountains to collect, and vigorously carry out the "small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" movements. People's communes must also operate wild plants in a planned way according to resource conditions, so that they become an inexhaustible source of raw materials. At the same time, they must extensively run preliminary processing industries for wild and miscellaneous fibers, and send the collected wild and miscellaneous fibers to textile enterprises after preliminary processing. Counties and people's communes with conditions can also set up small burlap sack factories, actively utilizing local resources to produce burlap sacks. This can ensure that textile enterprises regularly obtain wild and miscellaneous fibers, increase the accumulation of people's communes, and increase the income of commune members, which is beneficial to the country, the commune, and the individual. Of course, when carrying out collection and preliminary processing, textile industry departments and commercial departments should take the initiative to connect with people's communes and provide assistance in terms of manpower, materials, and technology.

The road of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers is getting wider and wider, and the future is bright. As long as the textile industry departments, commercial departments, and people's communes work together, continue to exert their energy, and work steadily, wild and miscellaneous fibers will surely emit a brilliant splendor in the continued leap forward of China's textile industry!

### 路越走越宽

    路越走越宽
    6月11日，本报发表了上海、青岛等地纺织企业广泛利用野杂纤维织布，以及浙江、陕西、福建等地搜集和加工野生纤维的消息，今天，又发表了全国各地纺织工业部门广泛试用野杂纤维纺纱织布的消息。读了这些消息，令人十分高兴。它启示我们：在纺织工业原料的来源上，我们的道路宽得很。
    过去，我国纺织工业的原料，几乎全取自棉、毛、麻、丝等家生纤维，其中主要的又是依靠棉花，而对野杂纤维，人们却利用得很少，偶而利用的，也只是用来混合纺织麻袋而已。因此，久而久之，人们一提到增加纺织原料，总是在家生纤维，特别是棉花上面打主意。棉花的好处很多，人们把它叫做“白色的金子”，现在是，将来也是我国纺织工业的主要原料之一。几年来，我国棉花产量已经有了很大的增长，今后我们还要不断地扩大棉花的生产，以保证纺织工业对棉花日益增长的需要。但是，棉花并不是纺织工业的唯一原料。而且对于我们这样一个人口众多的国家来说，仅仅依靠棉花以及其他家生纤维来纺纱织布，也是不能迅速地满足人民日益增长的衣著需要的。我们必须开辟新的纺织原料的来源，野杂纤维就是一个重要的新来源。我国地大物博，可供利用的野杂纤维到处都有。据现在初步了解，可供纺织用的野生植物有一百多种，其中如棉秆皮、胡麻、罗布麻、螫麻等品种的产量很大。在大力增产棉、麻、毛、丝的同时，把一切可以利用的野杂纤维都利用起来，对加速我国纺织工业的发展，会有很大的作用。
    现在，利用野杂纤维已经成为各地纺织企业技术革命的重要课题之一。各地用野杂纤维不仅生产了大量的麻袋，而且生产了大量的包装用布和其他用布。旅大金州纺织厂用野杂纤维生产的人字呢、卡其、华达呢、跃进呢等，以及陕西省各棉纺厂用棉秆皮、龙须草、构树皮和废棉下脚生产的白布、花布、色布等，都受到消费者的赞扬。当然，我国大量利用野杂纤维的工作还刚刚开始，我们的经验还不很多。但是，随着人们对野杂纤维的认识的不断提高以及技术革命的不断发展，我们利用野杂纤维的办法也一定会越来越多，越来越好。现在，我们的任务，就是大力支持一切利用和加工野生纤维的努力，采取有效的措施，扩大利用野杂纤维的工作规模。纺织工业的职工，一定要继续解放思想，提高本领。现在，在技术上还没有过野杂纤维的脱胶、纺纱、织布关的，要努力钻研，争取早日渡过这一难关；还要努力总结、巩固和提高用野杂纤维的技术经验。在制造麻袋方面，我们要尽量做到全部使用野杂纤维。在纺纱织布方面，我们要逐步扩大野杂纤维在混纺中的比例，并且不断提高产品质量。总之，在利用野杂纤维方面，能细（纺）就细，不能细则粗，能穿则穿，不能穿则用。我们既要有凌云的壮志，又要有实事求是的精神，从粗到细，从低级到高级，不断提高，再接再厉，长久地不懈地坚持努力下去。我们不但要把一切可以利用的野杂纤维都利用起来，而且还要利用得非常好。
    野杂纤维资源的分布，有的比较集中，有的比较分散，其中许多都在深山野岭里。为了继续扩大野杂纤维的利用范围，就需要组织力量进行采集和初步加工（如剥皮、脱胶等等）。各地人民公社一定要充分发挥自己的优越性，合理安排劳动力，组织群众上山采集，大搞“小夏收”、“小秋收”运动。人民公社还要根据资源条件，有计划地经营野生植物，使之成为取之不尽的原料来源，同时要广泛地兴办野杂纤维的初步加工工业，把采集的野杂纤维初步加工以后再送到纺织企业里去。县和有条件的人民公社，还可以兴办小型麻袋厂，积极利用当地资源生产麻袋。这样，既可以保证纺织企业经常得到野杂纤维，又能增加人民公社的积累，增加社员的收入，于国家、于公社、于个人都是有利的。当然，在进行采集和初步加工的时候，纺织工业部门、商业部门，都应当主动地和人民公社挂钩，并从人力、物力、技术等方面给予帮助。
    利用野杂纤维的道路，越走越宽，前程远大。只要纺织工业部门、商业部门和人民公社共同努力，继续鼓足干劲，踏踏实实地干下去，野杂纤维在我国纺织工业继续跃进中一定会放出瑰丽的异彩来！
