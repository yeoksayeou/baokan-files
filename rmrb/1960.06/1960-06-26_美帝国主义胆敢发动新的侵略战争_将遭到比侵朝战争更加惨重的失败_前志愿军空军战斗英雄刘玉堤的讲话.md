Comrades:
	I fully support the speech by Comrade Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and firmly support the just struggle of Korea, Japan, and all peace-loving people around the world against U.S. imperialist aggression.

	U.S. imperialism has always been the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people around the world. It establishes military bases everywhere, engages in military provocations and war threats everywhere, interferes in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, and is determined to be the enemy of the world's people. Ten years ago today, U.S. Secretary of State and war-monger Dulles ran to Korea and launched the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Today, the U.S. gangster chieftain and war plague god, Eisenhower, is personally coming forward, running around everywhere, plotting new aggressive conspiracies, and attempting to make a desperate struggle. The Chinese people are now engaged in great socialist construction, and the Chinese people need a peaceful international environment, but the experience of prolonged struggle against imperialism and reactionaries tells us that we must never beg for peace from these man-eating jackals. The Chinese people understand the value of peace, but they are also not afraid of war. Any war provocation by U.S. imperialism cannot scare us. If U.S. imperialism does not accept the lessons of the past and dares to launch a new war of aggression, it will inevitably suffer an even more disastrous defeat than in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "In the face of beasts, we must not show the slightest timidity. We must learn from Wu Song on Jingyang Gang." The Chinese People's Volunteers followed Chairman Mao's wise teachings and taught the beast of U.S. imperialism a severe lesson in Korea. I, too, as a soldier of the Volunteer Air Force, fought against these aggressive bandits on the Korean battlefield. I have seen the cruel and barbaric behavior of these bandits, and I have also seen the despicable and cowardly faces of these bandits.

	At the very beginning of the Korean War, the U.S. aggressors vigorously boasted about their air superiority and dispatched a large number of aircraft to strafe everywhere at low altitude, shooting people and cars whenever they saw them, sometimes almost skimming the ground, truly reaching the point of madness. However, it was ultimately a paper tiger, and its fierce and frightening shell was finally ruthlessly stripped off by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. I first saw the true form of this paper tiger on November 23, 1951. During a combat flight, we discovered a group of enemies, but suddenly the targets disappeared. When we descended to an altitude of 4,000 meters to search, we discovered that these eight barbaric and shameless enemy planes were carrying out repeated bombing and strafing of a peaceful village with no military facilities whatsoever. This cruel and hateful behavior of the U.S. bandits aroused our full of anger, and we were determined to avenge the suffering Korean people. So we increased our throttle and swooped down. This group of bandits, who were engaged in murder, panicked and tried to escape to the sea like thieves as soon as they were intercepted by us, but they could not escape the punishment they deserved. In this battle, I shot down four enemy planes in one breath, causing the U.S. air bandits to suffer a shameful end.

	The great victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea not only taught the U.S. bandits a severe lesson, but also showed the people of the world that imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. Although it colluded with the armies of a dozen or so vassal states and used the most modern equipment, it ultimately failed to save its fate of defeat. Chairman Mao told us: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is absolutely correct. Do not look at it baring its fangs and claws and running rampant, as long as the people of all countries unite and support each other and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, they will surely be able to expose their true face as paper tigers and will surely be able to thwart their plans for aggression. We firmly oppose U.S. aggression against Korea and firmly support the Korean people in their peaceful reunification of their motherland. U.S. imperialism should get out of South Korea, get out of Japan, get out of South Vietnam, get out of our territory of Taiwan, and get out of all the aggressive bases occupied by the United States. As Chairman Mao said: "The life of imperialism will not be long. They have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people of the world will never forgive them." The power of the people is infinite, and victory will surely belong to us.

### 美帝国主义胆敢发动新的侵略战争  将遭到比侵朝战争更加惨重的失败  前志愿军空军战斗英雄刘玉堤的讲话

    美帝国主义胆敢发动新的侵略战争
    将遭到比侵朝战争更加惨重的失败
    前志愿军空军战斗英雄刘玉堤的讲话同志们：
    我完全拥护中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若同志的讲话，坚决支持朝鲜、日本和全世界一切爱好和平反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    美帝国主义从来就是全世界爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。它到处建立军事基地，到处进行军事挑衅和战争威胁；到处干涉别国内政，决心与世界人民为敌。十年前的今天，美国国务卿、战争贩子杜勒斯跑到朝鲜，发动了侵朝战争。今天，美国强盗头子、战争瘟神艾森豪威尔，又亲自出马、各处奔走，策划新的侵略阴谋，企图作垂死的挣扎。中国人民现在正在从事伟大的社会主义建设，中国人民需要一个和平的国际环境，但是同帝国主义和反动派长期斗争的经验告诉我们，决不能向这些吃人的豺狼乞求和平。中国人民懂得和平的可贵，但是也绝不害怕战争，美帝国主义的任何战争挑衅是吓不倒我们的。如果美帝国主义还不接受过去的教训，胆敢发动新的侵略战争，就必将遭到比侵朝战争更加惨重的失败。
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦，我们要学景阳冈上的武松。”中国人民志愿军就是遵循着毛主席的英明教导，在朝鲜狠狠地教训过美帝国主义这只野兽。我也曾经作为一个志愿军空军的战士，在朝鲜战场上，打击过这些侵略强盗。看见过这些强盗的凶残野蛮的行为；也看到过这些强盗的卑鄙怯懦的面目。
    朝鲜战争刚一开始，美国侵略者就大肆吹嘘它的空中优势，并出动了大批飞机，到处低飞扫射，见人打人，见车打车，有时几乎是掠地而过，真是疯狂到了极点。但是，它终究还是纸老虎，它那凶恶吓人的外壳，终于被英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，无情地剥下来了。我第一次看到这只纸老虎的原形还是在1951年11月23日，我们在一次战斗飞行中，发现了一批敌人，突然目标又不见了，当我们下降到四千米高度搜索的时候，才发现这八架野蛮无耻的敌机，竟在对一个毫无军事设施的和平小村庄，进行轮番轰炸扫射。美国强盗这种凶残可恶的行为，激起我们满腔的怒火，我们决心为受难的朝鲜人民复仇。于是我们加大油门，往下俯冲，这批正在干着杀人勾当的强盗，一遭到我们的截击，慌慌张张像小偷一样企图向海面逃去，但是它们没能逃脱应有的惩罚，在这次战斗中，我一气击落四架敌机，使美国空中强盗遭到了可耻的下场。
    抗美援朝战争的伟大胜利，不仅狠狠地教训了美国强盗，同时也向全世界人民表明，帝国主义并没有什么了不起，尽管它勾结了十几个仆从国家的军队，用的是最现代的装备，终于没有能挽救他们失败的命运。毛主席告诉我们：
  “帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”真是一点也不错，不要看它张牙舞爪，横行不法，只要各国人民团结起来互相支持，向帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，就一定能戳穿它们纸老虎的真面目，一定能挫败它们的侵略计划。我们坚决反对美国侵略朝鲜，坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国。美帝国主义应当从南朝鲜滚出去，从日本滚出去，从南越南滚出去，从我国的领土台湾滚出去，从美国霸占的一切侵略基地滚出去。毛主席所说的：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们”。人民的力量是无穷的，胜利一定属于我们。（附图片）
