Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Amidst the nationwide upsurge of people resolutely opposing American imperialist aggression and angrily condemning the arch-war-monger "plague god" Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan and the Far East, major cities including the capital, Beijing, and Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an will hold a grand "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" from June 21st to 27th.

During the Propaganda Week, there will be a film week, an artistic performance week, and a radio broadcast week related to the anti-American struggle and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Central and provincial/municipal newspapers will publish special issues on the anti-American struggle. In the capital, starting from the 21st, the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Hall in the Revolutionary Military Museum will be opened, and an art exhibition on anti-American struggle themes will be held.

On the evening of the 20th, the capital will hold an opening ceremony for the "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" film exhibition. The film exhibition will screen more than 30 documentaries and feature films with anti-American struggle themes. These include the famous film "Shangganling" and the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio's newly produced documentary "Asian Storm," among others.

The opening ceremony of the "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" art performance in the capital will be held at the Capital Theater on the evening of the 21st. The performances will include Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Yue Opera, folk art, song and dance, drama, music, and puppet shows, all with content on the anti-American struggle, including "On the 38th Parallel," "Steel Transport Soldiers," "Long Live Heroes," etc., as well as political satire plays, living newspapers, and various forms of new programs that theaters are working day and night to create.

The Capital Art Exhibition will open on the 22nd, exhibiting more than 150 works of art such as cartoons, propaganda posters, traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, and sculptures.
