Zhengzhou, June 14 (This newspaper) - The mining departments of Henan Province's metallurgical industry are vigorously grasping mine technical reforms centered on increasing iron ore production, causing ore output to rise steadily. Many iron and steel enterprises have been able to fully feed their blast furnaces and have enough to spare, basically guaranteeing the needs of greatly exceeding steel production targets. From January to May, the province's total ore production increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year, and the ore produced in the first ten days of June was more than 10,000 tons more than the same period of the red-hot May campaign.

In the process of mine technical transformation, all regions have conscientiously implemented the Henan Provincial Party Committee's policy of "simultaneous advancement of technical transformation and current production, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and integrating large, medium, and small mines." The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has rapidly risen to over 50% in a short period of several months, and some mines have been or are being armed with modern equipment. With the increase in the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, a new situation of a substantial increase in ore production has emerged.

In the technical transformation of mines, Henan Province has also adopted the working method of grasping current production on the one hand and preparing for the next step of production on the other, achieving "taking one step, grasping two steps, and looking at three steps," as well as simultaneous exploration, design, construction, and production, implementing rapid stripping, rapid tunneling, and rapid installation. In order to speed up the pace of mine technical transformation, the Provincial Party Committee held an emergency mine meeting on June 2, deciding to carry out technical transformation of the province's key mines in three batches, so that these mines will basically form a near-modern ore production base, ensuring a continuous supply of ore and fully meeting the needs of the continuous leap forward in steel production.

Hefei, June 14 (This newspaper) - Mines in Anhui are seizing the opportunity to increase ore production for blast furnace production. By the end of May, the province's iron ore production had exceeded the state plan by 24%, completing half of the annual plan ahead of schedule. From June 1st to 10th, mining workers in various regions increased iron ore production by more than 270,000 tons for the state.

The in-depth development of the technical revolution movement has brought about an unprecedented leap forward in mine production in various parts of Anhui. Especially after entering April, many mine leading cadres went deep into the front line of production to grasp the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovations in a concrete and meticulous manner, so that many effective advanced experiences were quickly popularized, more powerfully promoting the development of production. At present, eighteen mines, including Duxiu Mountain, Jitou Mountain, Yangqiao, Yezhi Mountain, and Qi Mountain, have realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of rock drilling, tunneling, and transportation, eliminating the heavy labor of shoulder carrying and manual drilling. The staff and workers of the Fanchang County Mining Bureau's five mines imitated and created more than 400 advanced tools in two months, and the entire mine completed the state plan for the first half of the year in only four months. Due to the vigorous promotion of advanced tools such as inclined-plane skids, multi-strand cableways, and self-unloading wooden mine cars, the Yezhi Mountain Iron Mine in Tianchang County has increased the work efficiency of all employees by more than tenfold compared to the same period last year. While substantially increasing ore production, the production costs of many mines have also significantly decreased.

In order to fully utilize resources and increase the production of qualified ore, some mines also adopted indigenous methods to vigorously carry out the washing and beneficiation of fine ore. After the establishment of fine ore washing and beneficiation plants in various mines in Fanchang County, 30% of the fine ore was utilized. The Huangmeishan Mine in Dangtu County can wash and beneficiate more than 400 kilograms of qualified ore from one ton of yellow mud ore, and the ore grade is all above 60%.

Changsha, June 14 (This newspaper) - The level of iron ore production in Hunan Province has been continuously rising. Since the beginning of this year, the province has overfulfilled its production plan every month. In the first ten days of June, it overfulfilled the state production plan by 29%, and the daily production level increased by 1.5% compared to the average daily production level of the previous month.

Since the beginning of this year, the production of the iron and steel industry in Hunan Province has developed greatly, and a number of small-scale, foreign-style and indigenous iron smelting enterprises have been newly built and expanded in various regions. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, iron ore enterprises in various regions have carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements targeting weak links such as mining, excavation, hoisting, transportation, roasting, crushing, and screening. At present, the twenty-five key iron mines in the province have basically eliminated manual drilling, and their output has greatly increased.

Strengthening flood prevention and water management to ensure increased production in the rainy season is an important reason for the daily increase in ore production in Hunan Province. In order to achieve the requirements of increased production in the rainy season, all iron mines in the province prepared and vigorously carried out flood prevention and water management from last winter, adopting measures such as opening diversion ditches, filling cracks, and modifying river courses to prevent surface water; at the same time, they increased a number of indigenous water pumps and other drainage tools through self-reliance, basically realizing the requirements of no water entering the mine and no standing water in the mine. Therefore, in the two months of April and May, when there was more rain, the province's daily ore production increased by more than 20% compared to January.

At present, the staff and workers of iron ore enterprises throughout the province are working with even greater vigor, taking the approach of grasping current production on the one hand and preparing for July production on the other, expanding work surfaces, increasing the amount of ore reserves mined, and striving for a red June to the end and a red start in July.

Hangzhou, June 14 (This newspaper) - The vast number of staff and workers in Zhejiang's mines have seen a new situation of monthly red in this year's ore seizing battle. As of June 10, the province's ore production had completed 64% of the annual production plan, completing the first half of the year's production plan sixty-one days ahead of schedule. The ore production in the first ten days of June also increased by 19% compared to the same period in May.

Since the beginning of this year, Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang have strengthened their leadership over ore production from the outset. The Party committees of various mines not only arranged production plans on a monthly and ten-day basis, implemented them at all levels, and assigned responsibility to specific areas and individuals, but also participated in production, led production, and grasped the key and weak links in production, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. This year, the Provincial Department of Metallurgy has successively held four on-site meetings in the mines of Jinhua, Jiaxing, Hangzhou and other regions, promptly summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of various mines and other regions.

In order to substantially increase ore production, the Party committees of various mines have strengthened their leadership over ore technical transformation this year, targeting weak points and key issues, adhering to indigenous methods, and vigorously carrying out technical innovation. According to statistics, more than 10,000 innovation projects have been realized from January to May, including more than 2,500 major innovation projects, which have greatly promoted the increase in production capacity and improved the labor intensity of employees.

In addition to strengthening the leadership of mine technical transformation, various regions have also tightly grasped the link of raw material transportation. At present, many areas' mines and transportation lines have realized cableway, vehicle, track, and mechanized transportation.

Lanzhou, June 14 (This newspaper) - Iron smelting plants and mining plants in Gansu Province are actively carrying out technical transformation, vigorously grasping iron ore production, and improving ore quality to ensure that blast furnaces are full, well-fed, and have surplus grain.

In the past, the mining industry in Gansu Province was always heavy manual operation, with low efficiency and poor ore quality, which far from met the needs of the iron smelting industry. Since the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the staff and workers on the mining front in the province have broken down superstition, used indigenous methods, and vigorously carried out mine technical transformation. As of now, nine mines, including Baojiagou, Fanjiasi, and Dongdashan, have completed the first phase of technical transformation and realized indigenous mechanization.

Due to the active implementation of mine technical transformation, the province's iron ore production had completed half of the annual plan one month ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 6.1% by the end of May. The daily production level has also been rising month by month, with April increasing by 1% compared to the first quarter, and May increasing by 2.8% compared to April. The Gansu Provincial Bureau of Metallurgy has also organized a mine technical transformation working group headed by the director to go deep into the front line of production, vigorously grasping weak links such as mining, stripping, and transportation, further launching a high tide of increasing ore production and mine technical transformation.

    河南、安徽、湖南、浙江、甘肃等省加速矿山技术改造
    本报郑州14日电　河南省冶金工业采矿部门大抓以增产铁矿石为中心的矿山技术改革使矿石产量节节上升，不少炼铁企业已作到高炉吃饱、吃好有余，基本上保证了钢铁大超产的需要。全省1月到5月共生产矿石比去年同期增长两倍多，6月上旬生产的矿石，比大战红5月的同期多产一万多吨。
    各地在矿山技术改造过程中认真贯彻执行了中共河南省委“技术改造与当前生产同时并举、土洋并举和大中小矿山相结合”的方针，机械化和半机械化程度，在短短的几个月中迅速上升到50％以上，部分矿山已经或正在用现代化设备武装起来。随着机械化和半机械化程度的增长，矿石产量出现了大幅度上升的新局面。
    河南省在矿山技术改造中，还采用了一手抓当前生产，一手抓下步生产准备的工作方法，作到了“走一步、抓两步、看三步”和边勘探、边设计、边施工、边生产，实行快速剥离、快速掘进、快速安装。为了加快矿山技术改造的速度，省委于6月2日召开了矿山紧急会议，决定将全省重点矿山分三批进行技术改造，使这些矿山基本上形成一个接近现代化矿石生产基地，保证矿石供应源源不断，充分满足钢铁生产持续跃进的需要。
    本报合肥14日电　安徽各地矿山抓紧时机，为高炉生产增产矿石。到5月底止，全省铁矿石已经超额24％提前完成国家计划的一半。6月1日至10日，各地采矿工人又为国家增产铁矿石二十七万多吨。
    技术革命运动的深入发展，使安徽各地矿山生产出现了一个空前跃进的局面，特别是进入4月以后，许多矿山领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，具体细致地抓技术革新的巩固、推广和提高工作，使许多行之有效的先进经验迅速得到推广，更加有力地促进了生产的发展。现在，全省已有独秀山、鸡头山、杨桥、冶山、戚山等十八个矿场，实现了凿岩、掘进、运输机械化和半机械化，消灭了肩挑人抬和用手工打眼的笨重劳动。繁昌县矿务局所属五个矿场的职工，在两个月的时间内就仿制和创造先进工具四百多件，全矿只用了四个月的时间就完成了上半年国家计划。天长县冶山铁矿，由于大力推广斜坡滑车、多丝索道、自卸木矿车等先进工具，今年以来，全员工效比去年同期提高十倍以上。在大幅度增产矿石的同时，许多矿山的生产成本也都有了显著的下降。
    为了充分利用资源，增产合格矿石，有的矿还采用土法，大搞粉矿洗选。繁昌县各矿场建立粉矿洗选厂后，使30％的粉矿得到了利用。当涂黄梅山矿场，从一吨黄坭矿中可以洗选出四百多公斤合格矿石，矿石品位都在60％以上。
    本报长沙14日电　湖南省铁矿石生产水平不断上升，今年以来全省月月超额完成了生产计划，6月上旬又超额完成国家生产计划29％，日产水平比上月平均日产水平增加1．5％。
    今年以来，湖南省钢铁工业生产有很大发展，各地新建和扩建了一批小洋群、小土群炼铁企业。在各级党委领导下，各地铁矿企业针对采掘、提升、运输、焙烧、破碎、筛选等薄弱环节，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动。目前，全省二十五个重点铁矿基本上消灭了手工打眼，产量都大大增加。
    加强防水治水工作保证雨季增产是湖南省矿石产量逐日上升的重要原因，为了实现雨季增产的要求，全省各铁矿从去年冬季就作准备大搞防水、治水，采取开引沟、填裂缝、改河道等办法防治地面水；同时自力更生增加了一批土水泵等排水工具，基本上实现了水不进矿井，井内无积水的要求，因此在今年4、5月两个月雨水较多的情况下，全省日产矿石比元月份增长20％以上。
    目前全省铁矿企业的职工正在鼓足更大干劲，采取一手抓好当前生产，一手抓7月生产准备工作，扩大工作面，增加储采矿量，争取6月红到底，7月开门红。
    本报杭州14日电　浙江各矿山广大职工，今年在夺矿大战中，出现了月月红的新局面。到6月10日止，全省的矿石产量已完成全年生产计划的64％，提前六十一天完成上半年生产计划。6月上旬的矿石产量又比5月同期增长19％。
    今年以来，中共浙江各级党委一开始就加强了矿石生产的领导，各矿山党委不仅按月按旬安排生产计划，层层落实，并且分片包干，负责到底，参加生产，领导生产，抓住生产上的关键和薄弱环节，总结、推广先进经验。今年，省冶金厅就先后在金华、嘉兴、杭州等地区的矿山召开了四次现场会议，及时总结和推广各矿山和外地的先进经验。
    为了大幅度增产矿石，今年各矿山党委都加强了对矿石技术改造的领导，针对薄弱关键，坚持土法上马，大搞技术革新，据统计，1至5月份已经实现的革新项目有一万余件，其中重大的革新项目有二千五百多件，大大促进了生产能力提高，改善了职工劳动强度。
    除了加强矿山的技术改造领导外，各地还狠狠抓住原材料的运输这一环节，目前许多地区的矿山和运输干线上都实现了运输索道化、车子化、轨道化和机械化。
    本报兰州14日电　甘肃省各炼铁厂和采矿厂积极进行技术改造，大抓铁矿石生产，提高矿石质量，以保证高炉吃饱、吃好、有余粮。
    甘肃省的采矿工业，过去一直是笨重的手工操作，效率低，矿石质量差，远远满足不了炼铁工业的需要。自从开展技术革新和技术革命运动以来，全省采矿战线上的职工，破除迷信，土法上马，大搞矿山技术改造。截至目前，已有包家沟、范家寺、东大山等九个矿山完成了第一期技术改造，实现了土机械化。
    由于积极进行矿山技术改造，全省铁矿石生产截止5月底，已提前一个月、超额6．1％完成了全年计划的一半。日产水平也是逐月上升，4月比一季度增长1％，5月又比4月增长了2．8％。甘肃省冶金局还组织了以局长为首的矿山技术改造工作组，深入生产第一线，大抓采矿、剥离、运输等薄弱环节，更进一步掀起一个增产矿石和矿山技术改造的高潮。
