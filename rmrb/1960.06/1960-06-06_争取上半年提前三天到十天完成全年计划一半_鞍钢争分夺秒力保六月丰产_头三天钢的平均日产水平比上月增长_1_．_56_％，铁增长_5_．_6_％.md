Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th June. The steel capital, Anshan, is witnessing a concerted effort from the entire Party and all the people to fight a great battle in June, ensuring the completion of half of the annual plan for steel, iron, and steel products three to ten days ahead of schedule. As soon as June arrived, good news of production kept coming from all fronts. In the first three days, the average daily steel production level increased by 1.56% compared with the previous month, and iron increased by 5.6%.

To ensure that June becomes a month of bumper steel production, the workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Works had already made preparations for a great effort in June by the end of last month. At the same time, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a general headquarters for the steel production battle, headed by Yang Shijie, the First Secretary of the Municipal Committee. Sub-command headquarters were also formed for various production systems such as steelmaking, ironmaking, and steel rolling.

Currently, leading cadres of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Party Committee, together with leading cadres of key factories and mines, are starting with extensively mobilizing the masses, investigating and studying, and solving key production problems. At the same time, they persist in working alongside the workers for half a day every Saturday morning, truly achieving unity from top to bottom.

The workers and staff fighting on the steelmaking front are currently enthusiastically carrying out a competition to learn from Open Hearth Furnace No. 6, catch up with and surpass the competitors of Open Hearth Furnace No. 6, seizing every minute to produce more steel while maintaining the furnace body of the open hearth furnace. The workers of Open Hearth Furnace No. 6, famous for maintaining the furnace body and increasing the charge volume, started with maintaining the furnace body in May, shortening the average smelting time of each furnace of steel by 1.14 minutes compared with April, thus increasing the daily production level by more than 8%. The experience of Open Hearth Furnace No. 6, after being summarized by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Party Committee, is being promoted on various large open hearth furnaces.

    为保证把6月变成钢铁丰产月，鞍钢各厂矿职工，早在上月底就做好了大干6月份的准备。同时，中共鞍山市委成立了由市委第一书记杨士杰亲自挂帅的夺钢大战总指挥部，炼钢、炼铁、轧钢等各个生产系统也组成了分指挥部。
    目前，中共鞍山市委、鞍钢党委的领导干部，正在同各重点厂矿领导干部一起，从广泛地发动群众入手，调查研究和解决生产关键问题，同时坚持在每个星期六上午同工人一块劳动半天，真正做到上下一个样。
    奋战在炼钢战线上的职工们，目前正在热火朝天地开展学习六号平炉、赶上和超过六号平炉的对手赛，在维护好平炉炉体的基础上，争分夺秒向时间要钢。以维护好平炉炉体、扩大装入量著名的六号平炉职工，在5月份从维护炉体入手，使每炉钢的平均熔炼时间比4月份缩短一点十四分钟，因而日产水平猛增8％以上。六号平炉的经验，经过鞍钢党委总结，正在各大型平炉上推广。
