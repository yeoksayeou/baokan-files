In our lives, we often encounter situations like this: when undertaking a task, especially one involving revolutionary action, if we only pay lip service to its importance and the great benefits it will bring, without truly committing to a revolutionary resolve, then the task is bound to be poorly executed. It may be abandoned halfway, or carried out incompletely, resulting in little impact. Conversely, if we establish a revolutionary determination, with soaring spirit and boundless energy, then measures and methods will emerge. When people are filled with vigor, everything becomes easier, and as a result, the task is indeed accomplished and done well. Such examples are abundant. One such example right before us is the dismantling of scaffolding on all construction sites in Shenyang City within a single day.

Scaffolding is used for building houses. For thousands of years, it has been a "good friend" of construction workers. Without it, houses could not be built. Since the Great Leap Forward, people have been contemplating saying goodbye to this "old friend," using more convenient and economical advanced methods to replace this old method of scaffolding, which is both lumber-intensive, labor-intensive, and inconvenient. Some construction sites succeeded and persisted; some tried for a while, encountered some difficulties, and felt that the old method was more convenient, so they backtracked, dismantling and then re-erecting the scaffolding; some construction sites simply did not even try. As a result, scaffolding stubbornly stood densely on many construction sites.

Must the law of things be like this? Not necessarily. Construction workers in Shenyang City and many places in Liaoning Province have given us such an answer. One hundred and twenty-four construction units in Shenyang City launched a vigorous campaign on May 2nd, fighting for a day and a night, finally bidding farewell to scaffolding. Where does the power come from? First, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was determined to eliminate scaffolding; second, it fully mobilized the masses; and third, it created the necessary material and technical conditions with its own hands.

The important significance of this example is not only that it has a reference value for all construction sites that have not yet dismantled scaffolding, but also for promoting technological revolution and rapidly and universally applying the achievements of the technological revolution to production.

The objects of the technological revolution are generally old tools, equipment, and methods that have been used by people for a long time. And habit is a stubborn force. Sometimes, although people subjectively recognize that these tools, equipment, or methods are backward, and have revolutionary ideas, and even have come up with revolutionary methods, if the revolutionary will is not firm, the old habits may still be revived. New methods to replace scaffolding were conceived one or two years ago, but why have they not been widely promoted in many places for a long time? And now, why can Shenyang City dismantle all scaffolding in one day? Ultimately, it is still a matter of revolutionary determination. Perhaps some people argue: we have not promoted it because we encountered some troubles. However, whether it is a revolution of society or a revolution of nature, how can there be no trouble at all? If there are no troubles or difficulties at all, what is the point of revolution?

Technological innovation and technological revolution in various industries have produced many advanced experiences. The problem now is to promote them. Only by transforming individual advanced experiences into the common wealth of the majority can new productive forces truly develop, production can increase substantially, and it can become an effective guarantee for completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, completing and over fulfilling this year's continued leap forward plan.

Promotion requires revolutionary determination. We must be as determined as the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee in its determination to dismantle scaffolding, so that the colorful flowers of technological revolution can bear abundant fruits.

    决心办，果然就办到了
    陈之衍
    在我们的生活中，常常遇到这样的情况：办一件事情，特别是一些带有革命行为的事情，如果只是口头上讲讲如何重要，办了有多么大的好处，而没有真正下定革命的决心，那末，事情一定办不好。或者半途而废，或者办得很不彻底，因而效果不大。反过来，如果立定了革命的决心，意志昂扬，气冲牛斗，于是措施和办法都出来了。人而有气，一切都好办了，结果，事情果然就办到、办好了。这样的例子俯拾皆是。眼前的一件就是沈阳市在一昼夜间放倒了全市建筑工地的脚手架。
    脚手架是盖房子用的，千百年来脚手架是建筑工人的“好朋友”，没有它，房子就盖不起来。大跃进以来，人们谋虑和这个“老朋友”告别，用更方便、更节约的先进办法来代替脚手架这个既费木料又费工、又不方便的老办法。有的工地成功了，并且坚持下来了；有的工地试了一阵，碰到一些困难，觉得还是老办法方便，于是又走回头路，脚手架放倒又竖起了；有的工地，干脆连试都没有试。结果是，脚手架依然顽强地密密麻麻地矗立在许多工地上。
    事情的规律一定是这样吗？不一定。沈阳市和辽宁省许多地方的建筑工人给我们作了这样的回答。沈阳市一百二十四个施工单位，在5月2日这一天，发起了一个轰轰烈烈的运动，大战一昼夜，和脚手架最后告别了。威力从何而来？一在于中共沈阳市委下定了革掉脚手架的决心；二在于充分发动了群众；三在于自己动手，创造了必需的物质技术条件。
    这个事例的重要意义，不只是对一切还没有放倒脚手架的建筑工地有借鉴作用，而且对于推进技术革命，把技术革命的成果迅速地普遍地应用于生产。
    技术革命的对象，大体上总是由来已久地被人们长期习惯使用的陈旧的工具、设备和方法。而习惯是一股顽强的势力。有时候，人们主观上虽已认识到这种工具、设备或者方法是落后的，也有了革命的念头，甚至也已经想出了革命的办法，但是如果革命意志不坚决，旧的习惯势力，仍然可能借尸还魂。代替脚手架的新办法，在一两年前就想出来了，可是为什么许多地方久久不能普遍推广呢？而现在沈阳市为什么又能在一昼夜之间就把脚手架全部放倒呢？归根结底，还是个革命决心问题。也许有人申辩说：我们没有推广，是因为遇到了一些麻烦，可是，不论是革社会的命还是革自然界的命，怎么可能会没有一点麻烦呢？根本没有麻烦、没有困难，还叫什么革命呢？
    各行各业的技术革新和技术革命，已经涌现出许许多多的先进经验，现在的问题在于推广，只有把个别的先进经验变为普遍的多数人的财富，新的生产力才能真正发展起来，生产才能大幅度的增长，才能变为上半年完成全年计划一半、完成和超额完成今年继续跃进计划的有效保证。
    推广，必须要下革命的决心。要像沈阳市委下决心放倒脚手架那样来下定决心，技术革命万紫千红的花朵才能结出累累的果实。
