Xinhua News Agency, London, June 17th: British bourgeois newspapers today widely commented on Eisenhower's forced postponement of his visit to Japan, believing it was a heavy blow suffered by the U.S. government.

    The influential "Times" editorial wrote, "The cancellation of the Tokyo trip is the biggest blow to the prestige of the U.S. President and the U.S. government in the postwar era." The editorial said that Eisenhower's "current frustration may put him at his lowest ebb."

    The newspaper also said, "It is not only the United States that feels this blow, but also its allies."

    "Daily Mail" said that this "not only gave President Eisenhower a slap in the face, but also gave the West a slap in the face," and it also said that to say that the U.S. global anti-communist strategy "has gone bankrupt today would not be an exaggeration."

    The "Daily Mail" editorial said that the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit "is the Kishi government's crushing defeat. It is a serious blow to America's self-esteem and prestige, and a setback for the West." The newspaper worried that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism would eventually "break the island chain that the United States uses to 'contain' the communist world -- Japan, Okinawa, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines. The Pentagon's strategic deployment will go bankrupt."

    "Daily Express" reporter McColl, in a dispatch from Manila, said that Eisenhower suffered an unexpected "heavy and astonishing disgrace" today. The newspaper also pointed out that the entire U.S. foreign policy is collapsing. The newspaper talked about the "four pillars of U.S. policy," it wrote: "Kishi Nobusuke - teetering. Syngman Rhee - bankrupt. Chiang Kai-shek - a joke. And Adenauer."

    The "Daily Herald" published an editorial entitled "A Dismal End," saying, "He was told (referring to Eisenhower) that because many Japanese people cannot tolerate American policy, he cannot visit Japan, which is a dismal end to his eight years in office." The newspaper also feared that this situation would cause a chain reaction, it said, "Other countries in the world may follow Japan in the struggle against American militarism," "possibly disintegrating the vast circle of American bases aimed at Russia."

    The "Daily Telegraph" editorial said, "There is no point in trying to minimize the blow suffered by the United States in the Far East due to the cancellation of Eisenhower's trip to Japan." The editorial complained, "If the visit had been canceled a few weeks ago, the United States would not have lost so much face."

    "The Scotsman" wrote that evidence shows that in Japan "opposition to this treaty signed with the United States is widespread and not limited to one class or party." The newspaper said, "At present, American diplomacy seems to be going from one big mistake to another."

    The "Daily Mirror" believes that "Washington's State Department is pursuing policies that are out of touch with the times." The newspaper's commentator Cassandra attacked Eisenhower, the architect of this policy, as a "completely incompetent person" and a "habitual offender."

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 17th: French bourgeois newspapers in their comments on the 17th believed that U.S. President Eisenhower's forced postponement of his "visit" to Japan was a huge failure for the United States.

    Paris's "Les Echos" commentary was titled "Setback in Tokyo." It said: "The cancellation of the President's visit to Japan after the failure of the summit is a serious blow to the reputation of the United States throughout the world." The Japanese people's "movement against the Kishi government thoroughly demonstrates the strongest anti-American tendencies."

    "Le Figaro's" commentary said: "The United States and the free world have suffered the most serious defeat in the Cold War between East and West." "The result of this American retreat is disgrace, greatly damaging America's position on both sides of the Pacific."

    It also said, "It is difficult to imagine that this blow will not deeply shake other strongholds: South Korea, which has already been greatly weakened, and Formosa (Taiwan), which is often on the verge of despair."

    Paris's "Combat" published an article entitled "The Victory of the Japanese Left Strengthens the Wave of Neutralism in Asia," saying: "Everyone is in complete agreement on this point: the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan is a far-reaching diplomatic defeat for the United States."

    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Sydney News: Australia's "Sydney Morning Herald" said on the 17th that Eisenhower's indefinite postponement of his visit to Japan "is a crushing defeat for American influence and prestige."

    The newspaper said that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is unpopular. Coupled with the exposure of the U.S. spy plane and the fresh memories of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima incidents, there is enough reason for the Japanese people to oppose this "visit."

    "Der Spiegel's" editorial said that Eisenhower's postponement of his visit to Japan was "a huge and tragic blow to the West's prestige."

    英法澳报纸评艾森豪威尔延期访日
    美国整个外交政策正在崩溃
    害怕日本人民的斗争在全世界引起连锁反应
    新华社伦敦17日电　英国资产阶级报纸今天纷纷对艾森豪威尔被迫延期访日发表评论，认为这是美国政府遭到的沉重打击。
    有影响的“泰晤士报”的社论写道，“东京之行的取消是美国总统和美国政府的威望在战后受到的最大的打击”。社论说，艾森豪威尔“目前的挫折可能使他处于最低潮”。
    这家报纸还说，“感觉到这个打击的不仅仅是美国，而且也有它的盟国”。
    “每日简报”说，这“不但给了艾森豪威尔总统一记耳光。而且给了西方一记耳光”，它还说，要说美国的全球性的反共战略“今天已经破产也不算是过分的”。
    “每日邮报”的社论说，艾森豪威尔这次访问的取消“是岸政府的惨重的失败。它是对美国的自尊心和威信的一个严重打击，并且是西方的一个挫折”。这家报纸担心日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争到头来终将“折断美国用以‘遏制’共产主义世界的岛屿——日本、冲绳、福摩萨（台湾）、菲律宾——链条。五角大楼的战略部署将破产”。
    “每日快报”记者麦科尔在发自马尼拉的一则电讯中说，艾森豪威尔今天遭受料想不到的“惨重和惊人的丢脸”。这家报纸还指出，美国整个外交政策正在崩溃。报纸谈到“美国政策的四个支柱”，它写道：“岸信介——摇摇欲坠。李承晚——破产。蒋介石——是个笑柄。还有一个阿登纳”。
    “每日先驱报”以“凄惨的结束”为题发表社论说，“人家告诉他（指艾森豪威尔），由于许多日本人不能容忍美国的政策，他不能访问日本，这是他执政八年后凄惨的结束。”这家报纸也害怕这种形势引起连锁反应，它说，“世界上的其他国家在反对美国黩武主义的斗争中可能效法日本”，“可能使美国针对俄国的广大基地圈瓦解”。
    “每日电讯报”的社论说，“企图缩小美国由于取消艾森豪威尔的日本之行而在远东所遭受的打击，没有什么好处”。社论埋怨说，“如果在几星期前取消访问，美国的面子不会丢得如此之多”。
      “苏格兰人报”写道，证据表明，日本“反对同美国签订的这个条约情绪是广泛的，并不局限于一阶级或政党”。这家报纸说，“目前美国的外交似乎是在从一个大错误走向另一个大错误”。
    “每日镜报”认为“华盛顿的国务院执行着有时代错误的政策”。这家报纸的评论员卡桑德拉攻击这种政策的制定者艾森豪威尔是“完全不称职的人”和“屡犯错误的人”。
    据新华社巴黎17日电　法国资产阶级报纸在17日的评论认为，美国总统艾森豪威尔被迫延期“访问”日本是美国的巨大的失败。
    巴黎“回声报”评论的题目是“在东京遭受的挫折”。它说：“在首脑会议失败之后取消总统访问日本之行，是对美国在世界各地的声望的严重打击”。日本人民“反对岸政府的运动，彻底地显示出最强烈的反美倾向。”
    “费加罗报”的评论说：“美国和自由世界在东西方的冷战中遭受了最严重的失败。”“美国的这一退却的结果是丢脸，使美国在太平洋两岸的地位大受损害。”
    它又说，“很难设想这一打击不会深深动摇其它据点：已经大大削弱的南朝鲜和往往濒于绝望边缘的福摩萨（台湾）。”
    巴黎“战斗报”以“日本左派的胜利加强亚洲的中立主义浪潮”为题发表的文章说：“大家在这一点上意见完全一致：取消艾森豪威尔访问日本之行，是美国在外交上影响深远的一次失败。”
    新华社18日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚“悉尼先驱晨报”17日说，艾森豪威尔无限期延期访问日本“是美国影响和威信的惨败”。
    这家报纸说，日美“安全条约”是不得人心的。加上美国间谍飞机的暴露以及长崎和广岛事件的记忆犹新，这就有足够的理由使日本人民反对这次“访问”了。
    “明镜”周刊的社论说，艾森豪威尔延期访日是“对西方威信的巨大而悲惨的打击”。
