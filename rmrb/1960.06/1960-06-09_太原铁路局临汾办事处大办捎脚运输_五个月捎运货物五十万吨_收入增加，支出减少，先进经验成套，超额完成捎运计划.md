Taiyuan Railway Bureau Linfen Office Vigorously Develops Incidental Transportation

Five Months of Incidental Freight Reaches 500,000 Tons

Increased Revenue, Reduced Expenditures, Complete Set of Advanced Experiences, Exceeding Incidental Transportation Plan

(Our Newspaper News) The staff of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Linfen Office have systematically summarized the various advanced experiences of incidental transportation, making them a complete set and creatively realizing the "one-dragon" incidental transportation, which powerfully guarantees the completion of the transportation plan.

Since this office began implementing incidental transportation in March 1959, it has transported a total of 633,130 tons of various materials by May of this year, completing 138.5% of the incidental transportation plan, accounting for 12.5% of the total transportation volume of this office. This not only increased railway revenue by more than 534,000 yuan and reduced expenditures by more than 312,000 yuan, but more importantly, it promptly transported urgently needed materials for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihoods without adding extra vehicles. Since the beginning of this year, the role of incidental transportation has become even more significant. From January to May, the freight transported incidentally reached 508,051 tons, exceeding the incidental transportation plan by 33%, accounting for 16.8% of the total transportation volume of this office.

The "one-dragon" incidental transportation of the Linfen Office is a combination of the "dispatcher - station - train conductor" and the "production, transportation, and sales" two-pronged major collaboration. From the preparation of the incidental transportation plan, organization of cargo sources, receiving goods, loading, running, unloading, and shipping, all the way to the warehouse of the receiving unit, this series of operations are organized jointly by the railway, material departments, and transport companies under the arrangement of a unified plan.

The characteristics of the "one-dragon" incidental transportation are: the dispatcher is the organizer and commander of incidental transportation, the station is the incidental transportation base, and the train conductor is the link between the dispatcher and the station. Under the dispatcher's unified incidental operation plan, the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales closely cooperate with each other, marching in step, and fully leveraging the initiative of each link. In order to jointly ensure the completion of the incidental transportation task, since the beginning of this year, the railway and material departments and transport departments in the Jinan area have established six joint incidental transportation offices at major stations, and the Linfen Railway Office and the Jinan Prefecture Commercial, Grain, and Transportation Bureau have established a joint incidental transportation guidance group. In this way, incidental transportation has embarked on the road of organization, systemization, and planning.

The experience of the Linfen Office proves that the "one-dragon" incidental transportation must grasp five main keys, which are "find, check, squeeze, grab, and report." "Find" means to find the source of goods. The station finds out the source of goods, organizes the goods to enter the station, and reports to the dispatcher to be included in the plan. "Check" means to check the vehicles. See which vehicles are suitable for incidental transportation, and determine the incidental transportation plan according to the source of goods and vehicle conditions. "Squeeze" means to squeeze time. The main thing is to adjust train operations and take measures such as early departures and catching up with the schedule. "Grab" means to rush loading and unloading. The dispatcher organizes the station and the train conductor to jointly formulate a loading and unloading operation plan to ensure quick loading and unloading without affecting train operation. "Report" means to organize forecasting. The dispatcher, station, and train conductor implement a continuous forecasting, the content of which includes arrival station, product name, quantity, train number, and vehicle location.

Because the Linfen Office has insisted on applying these advanced experiences, the planning and organization of incidental transportation have been greatly strengthened, and the role of incidental transportation has been greatly increased, making the role of incidental transportation increasingly significant.

    太原铁路局临汾办事处大办捎脚运输
    五个月捎运货物五十万吨
    收入增加，支出减少，先进经验成套，超额完成捎运计划
    本报讯　太原铁路局临汾办事处职工，把捎脚运输的各项先进经验加以系统地总结，使之成套，创造性地实现了捎脚运输“一条龙”，有力地保证了运输计划的完成。
    这个办事处从1959年3月开始实行捎脚运输，到今年5月，共捎运各种物资六十三万三千一百三十吨，完成捎运计划的138．5％，占这个办事处总运量的12．5％，不仅增加铁路收入五十三万四千多元，减少支出三十一万二千多元，更重要的是在不额外增加车辆的情况下，及时地运出了工农业生产资料和人民生活急需的物资。今年以来，捎脚运输的作用更为显著，1至5月，捎运的货物就有五十万八千零五十一吨，超额33％完成了捎运计划，占这个办事处总运量的16．8％。
    临汾办事处的捎运“一条龙”是“调度——车站——车长”和“产、运、销”两路大协作连环结合而成。从编制捎运计划，组织货源，进货、装车、运行、卸车、出货，一直到收货单位的仓库，这一系列的作业过程都是在统一计划的安排下，由铁路、物资部门和搬运公司共同组织实现的。
    捎运“一条龙”的特点是：调度是捎运的组织者和指挥者，车站至捎运基地，车长是调度和车站之间的纽带。在调度统一的捎运作业计划下，产、运、销三方面密切配合，步调一致，充分发挥各个环节的积极性。为了共同保证捎脚运输任务的完成，自今年以来，晋南地区铁路、物资部门和搬运部门在主要车站成立了六个捎脚运输联合办公室，临汾铁路办事处和晋南专署商业、粮食、交通局成立了捎脚运输联合指导小组。这样捎脚运输便走上了组织化、制度化、计划化的道路。
    临汾办事处的经验证明，捎脚运输“一条龙”必须抓住五个主要关键，就是“找、查、挤、抢、报”。“找”就是找货源。车站摸清货源，组织货物进站，报告调度纳入计划。“查”就是查车辆。看哪些车辆适合捎运，根据货源和车辆情况，确定捎运方案。“挤”，就是挤时间。主要是调整列车运行，采取早开、赶点等办法。“抢”就是抢装卸，由调度组织车站、车长共同制定装卸作业计划，保证快装快卸，不影响列车运行。“报”，即组织预报。调度、车站和车长实行连环预报，内容为到站、品名、数量、车次和车辆位置。
    临汾办事处由于坚持应用了这些先进经验，因此捎脚运输的计划性和组织性大大加强了，捎运量作用大大增加了，使捎脚运输的作用发挥得越来越大。
