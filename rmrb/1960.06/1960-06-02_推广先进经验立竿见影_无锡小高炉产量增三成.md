Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. By organizing "three-way combination" advanced experience promotion teams, Wuxi City has vigorously promoted advanced experiences in increasing production and saving raw materials, yielding significant results.

Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, relevant departments in the city, after evaluation and selection, identified forty major advanced experiences, including technical transformation of small blast furnaces, and gathered 280 advanced producers, veteran workers, technicians, and cadres familiar with these experiences. They formed thirty-five comprehensive and specialized "three-way combination" advanced experience promotion teams, which went down to the grassroots to disseminate experiences and promote mutual progress. Over the past month, around the promotion of experience, the city held a total of sixty on-site experience exchange meetings, held twenty-three technical lectures and seven technical training courses, enabling many major advanced experiences to blossom and bear fruit throughout the city. After completing the first stage of transformation, twelve small blast furnaces in the metallurgical system have now begun the second stage of comprehensive transformation. The utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the city has now averaged around 2; the pig iron production in early May increased by 31.27% compared to the same period last month, and coke consumption was reduced by 10%. After promoting advanced experiences in steelmaking converters, steel production also increased steadily, with the last five days of early May producing more than 250 tons of steel than the first five days.

    推广先进经验立竿见影
    无锡小高炉产量增三成
    新华社南京电　无锡市组织“三结合”先进经验推广队，大力推广增产节约原料材料的先进经验，已经收到显著效果。
    这个市的有关部门在市委领导下，经过评比挑选，确定了小高炉技术改造等四十项重大先进经验，并且集中了熟悉这些经验的先进生产者、老工人、技术人员和干部共二百八十人，组成三十五个综合性和专业性的“三结合”先进经验推广队，分头下基层传播经验，互相促进。一个月来，围绕推广经验，全市共召开了六十次现场经验交流会，举办了二十三次技术讲座和七个技术训练班，使许多重大先进经验在全市开花结果。冶金系统十二座小高炉在完成第一阶段改造后，现在又已开始进行第二阶段的全面改造。全市小高炉利用系数，目前平均已经常保持在二左右；5月上旬生铁产量比上月同期增长31．27％，节约焦炭10％。炼钢转炉推广了先进经验后，钢产量也节节上升，上旬后五天比前五天多产钢二百五十多吨。
