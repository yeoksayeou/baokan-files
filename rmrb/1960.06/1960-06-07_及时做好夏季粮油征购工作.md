    Promptly Carry Out the Summer Grain and Oil Procurement Work

    As summer crops are being harvested in large quantities one after another, a mass summer grain and oil procurement upsurge is arriving. This year, the sown area of summer crops across the country is not only larger than last year's, but also the crops are generally growing well. The yield in many places has increased compared to last year. The increase in summer crop production this year is the result of the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of members of the people's communes in fighting the severe drought, and it is also achieved with the strong support of the cities, industries, and all sectors of the national economy. Now, as summer crops are about to be universally harvested, promptly procuring summer grain and oilseed according to the state's planned procurement targets is not only of great significance for ensuring grain consumption in cities and economic crop areas before the autumn grain harvest, but also a pressing demand of the people's communes and the broad masses of members. After handing over summer grain and oil, the people's communes can exchange them for necessary means of production and means of livelihood, so as to better develop the means of production and arrange their lives. Summer grain procurement is also an important aspect of embodying mutual support between urban and rural areas, and industry and agriculture, and it is a powerful measure to ensure the continued overall leap forward of the entire national economy.
    In order to promptly procure summer grain and oil, Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the procurement work, and regard grain and oil procurement as an important task for a period of time. They must immediately mobilize and organize the masses to engage in the summer grain and oil procurement movement.
    Experience over the years has proven that one of the important keys to completing the procurement task is to combine grain procurement with grain distribution. The issue of rational grain distribution is essentially the issue of correctly handling the relationship between the state and the people's communes, and the issue of correctly handling the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. Therefore, we must start the procurement work in conjunction with the distribution work from the very beginning of the summer harvest, and make unified arrangements for public grain, purchased grain, seeds, rations, feed grain, and other grain uses, based on taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. In unified arrangements, we must ensure the completion of the state-stipulated grain and oil procurement targets, and at the same time, the people's communes' seeds, rations, and feed grain should also be reserved in accordance with the state-stipulated standards. This is a very meticulous work, and must not be done carelessly or simply. People's communes that have surplus grain after completing the sales tasks according to the state plan and arranging for the basic needs of all parties should also be encouraged to actively sell these surplus grains to support national construction.
    The broad masses of farmers in our country are not only grain producers, but also the consumers who consume the most grain. Arranging their lives well is an extremely important task. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the great importance attached by Party committees at all levels to arranging the lives of commune members, great achievements have been made in this regard, which has had a positive impact on the continued leap forward of agricultural production. This year, in the context of increased summer crop production, we must still attach great importance to this work. We must constantly enlighten and educate the broad masses of commune members, and arrange their lives in the spirit of looking ahead and behind, making a little go a long way, living frugally in good times, and living frugally in prosperous times. That is to say, when the people's communes arrange grain consumption, they should not consume as much as they distribute, and must leave room for maneuver, especially to prevent the phenomenon of wasting grain that may occur after the summer grain increase. Grain departments must actively help the people's communes to arrange the lives of commune members and run the public canteens well. Arranging the lives of commune members well is not only conducive to completing the state's grain and oil procurement tasks, but also conducive to encouraging their enthusiasm for production and striving for a better harvest after autumn.
    Grain is the "treasure of treasures," and it is a material that is frequently and heavily consumed by the broad masses and various sectors of the national economy. Therefore, paying attention to saving grain is not a trivial matter. Whether it is the state, the collective, or the individual, or whether it is rural or urban, we should cherish every grain, and pay attention to saving even in the case of a bumper harvest. Eating and using grain without a plan is not appropriate at any time. Paying attention to saving grain lies on the one hand in constantly grasping publicity and education for the broad masses, and on the other hand in strengthening leadership over grain management. Grain departments have much work to do in this regard. For example, helping communes and production teams train grain keepers, helping communes and production teams to effectively establish and improve the management system for rations, seeds, feed grain, and reserve grain, and helping public canteens to establish a grain management system. With a correct system, we can achieve dedicated storage, dedicated personnel in charge, receipts for collection, and a basis for expenditure, without any confusion, so that we can keep and use grain well, and avoid various wasteful phenomena.
    This year, we have the material basis of increased summer crop production and a bumper harvest. As long as we conscientiously implement the state's distribution policies, conduct in-depth and meticulous work, and carefully arrange the lives of the masses, we can not only complete or even overfulfill the summer grain and oil procurement tasks and ensure the state's need for grain and oil, but also the lives of the broad masses of members will surely be better.
    At present, it is the busy season of summer harvesting and summer planting. We must seize the opportunity to better arrange rural labor, so as to achieve timely harvesting, timely procurement, timely distribution, and timely arrangement of the lives of the masses. Doing the above work in a timely manner can not only avoid the waste and loss of grain and oil, but also better promote agricultural production. Therefore, this year, we must continue to use last year's experience and implement "five simultaneities and five goods" (simultaneous harvesting, threshing and drying, procurement, transferring and distribution; good harvest, good procurement, good distribution, good use, good storage), linking each step tightly together, completing everything in one go, and leaving no loose ends. In the procurement work, relevant business departments must also earnestly and systematically do a good job in inspecting grain quality, organizing transportation, weighing and warehousing, settling accounts and paying, and grassroots commercial departments must promptly do a good job in supplying goods to meet the needs of the people's communes for goods after handing over grain, so as to achieve a comprehensive victory in this year's summer grain and oil procurement work.

    及时做好夏季粮油征购工作
    随着夏熟作物大量陆续登场，一个群众性的夏季粮油征购高潮正在到来。今年全国夏熟作物不仅播种面积比去年扩大了而且作物一般生长良好，许多地方的产量都比去年有所增加。今年夏熟作物的增产是人民公社广大社员发挥了革命干劲，和干旱作了严重的斗争的情况下取得的，同时，也是在城市、工业以及国民经济各部门的大力支援下取得的。现在，当夏熟作物即将普遍登场的时候，按照国家计划征购指标及时地把夏粮和油菜籽征购起来，不仅对于在秋粮登场以前保证城市和经济作物区的粮食消费具有重要意义，同时也是人民公社和广大社员群众的迫切要求。人民公社在交售夏粮和油料以后就可以换回必需的生产资料和生活资料，更好地发展生产资料和安排生活。夏粮征购工作又是体现城市和乡村、工业和农业相互支援的一个重要方面，是保证整个国民经济继续全面跃进的一项有力措施。
    为了及时地把夏粮和油料征购起来，各级党委必须加强对征购工作的领导，并把粮油征购工作做为一个时期内的重要任务，立即动员和组织群众投入夏粮和油料的征购运动。
    历年的经验证明，完成征购任务的重要关键之一是把粮食征购工作和粮食分配工作结合起来。粮食的合理分配问题，实质上是正确处理国家和人民公社的关系问题，是正确处理国家、集体和个人三者的利益问题。因此，要从夏收一开始就把征购工作同分配工作结合起来进行，要本着兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面的利益，把公粮、购粮、种子、口粮、饲料粮和其它用粮进行统一安排。在统一安排中，要保证完成国家规定的粮油征购指标，同时对于人民公社的种子、口粮、饲料粮也应当按照国家规定的标准留够。这是一件很细致的工作，绝不可以马虎潦草，简单从事。人民公社在按照国家计划完成交售任务和安排了各方面基本需要之后还有余粮的，也应当鼓励他们踊跃出售这些余粮，支援国家建设。
    我国广大农民既是粮食的生产者，又是消费粮食最多的消费者，安排好他们的生活，是一件极为重要的工作。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，由于各级党委十分重视安排社员生活，在这方面已经取得了很大的成绩，对于农业生产继续跃进产生了良好的影响；今年在夏季作物增产的形势下，我们仍然要十分重视这一工作。要不断地启发和教育广大社员群众，本着瞻前顾后，细水长流，宽日子当窄日子过，富日子当穷日子过的精神来安排生活，也就是说，人民公社在安排粮食消费的时候，不要分配多少就消费多少，一定要留有余地，尤其要防止在夏粮增产以后可能发生的浪费粮食的现象。粮食部门要积极地帮助人民公社把社员生活安排好，把公共食堂办好。社员群众生活安排得好，不仅有利于完成国家粮油征购任务，而且有利于鼓励他们的生产积极性，争取秋后更好的收成。
    粮食是“宝中之宝”，是广大群众和国民经济各部门经常大量消费的物资，因此，注意节约使用粮食就不是一件小事情，不论是国家、集体和个人，也不论是农村和城市，都应当珍惜地使用每一粒粮食，即使在丰收的情况下也要注意节约。吃粮、用粮毫无计划，在任何时候都是不应该的。注意节约用粮，一方面在于经常地抓紧对广大群众的宣传教育，另一方面也要加强对粮食管理工作的领导。粮食部门在这方面要做许多工作。例如帮助公社和生产队训练粮食保管员，帮助公社和生产队切实地建立和健全口粮、种子、饲料粮、储备粮的管理制度，帮助公共食堂建立起粮食管理制度。有了正确的制度，就可以做到专库保管，专人负责，收有凭，支有据，丝毫不乱，这样就能够把粮食保管好、使用好，就可以避免各种浪费现象。
    今年我们有着夏季作物增产丰收的物质基础，只要我们切实地贯彻执行国家的分配政策，并且深入细致地进行工作，认真安排群众生活，不仅可以完成以至超额完成夏粮和油料的征购任务，保证国家对粮油的需要，而且广大社员的生活也一定会过得更好。
    目前正是夏收夏种的大忙季节，必须抓紧时机，更好地安排农村劳动力，做到及时收获，及时征购，及时分配，及时安排好群众生活。上述工作做得及时，不仅可以避免粮食和油料的浪费和损耗，而且也可以更好地推动农业生产。因此，今年仍然要继续运用去年的经验，实行“五边、五好”（边收割、边打晒、边征购、边调运、边分配；收获好、征购好、分配好、使用好、保管好），环环扣紧，一气呵成，不留尾巴。在征购工作中，有关业务部门还要踏踏实实、有条不紊地把检验粮质、组织运送、过秤入仓、结账付款等项工作做好，基层商业部门要及时做好商品供应，以满足人民公社在交售粮食以后，对商品的需要；从而使今年的夏季粮油征购工作取得全面的胜利。
