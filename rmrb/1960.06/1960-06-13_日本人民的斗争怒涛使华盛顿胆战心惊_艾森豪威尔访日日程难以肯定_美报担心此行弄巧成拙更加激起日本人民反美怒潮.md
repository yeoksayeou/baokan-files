Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th June: News from the US Presidential Office in Washington indicates that after the incident of the Japanese people angrily surrounding Hagerty, Eisenhower is "studying" his schedule for visiting Japan and it is "very likely to be revised."

    White House Assistant Press Secretary Mrs. Wheaton told reporters on the 11th that no detailed plans for the visit to Japan would be released for the time being, and a decision would be made after Hagerty, who had already been to Tokyo, made a decision.

    After sneaking out of Tokyo on the evening of the 11th, Hagerty planned to immediately meet with Eisenhower, who was departing for a visit to the Far East, in Anchorage, Alaska.

    Mrs. Wheaton said that the schedule was not fixed and would be released as the visit progressed.

    Finally, under repeated questioning from reporters, she admitted that the schedule "may have some slight modifications."

    News from Tokyo on the 11th stated that a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that Hagerty and Japanese officials had agreed to cancel the planned golf game between Eisenhower and Nobusuke Kishi. In addition, a press conference originally planned for Eisenhower has also been canceled. According to the Associated Press, Tokyo sources also anticipate that Eisenhower's speech in the Diet may also be canceled.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th June: The American propaganda machine reluctantly admits that the development of the angry mass struggle of the broad public in Japan against the US-Japan military treaty and against Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan has left Washington on the eve of Eisenhower's visit "shrouded in an atmosphere of uneasy gloom." The ordeal of President's advance man, White House Press Secretary Hagerty, at Tokyo Airport was the eye-catching top news story in all the evening papers yesterday, and the papers published photos of Hagerty's embarrassing situation. Radio and television stations have been continuously reporting these news since the morning. Newspapers and news agencies are commenting on Eisenhower's ill-omened visit in a very melancholy tone.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" in yesterday's editorial, while praying for Eisenhower "bon voyage and happy arrival" at its destination, worriedly wrote: As President Eisenhower begins his trip to the Pacific, "the western horizon is still shrouded in the terrible shadow of the riots of Japanese leftists." The newspaper believes that this is "a clear danger factor" in Eisenhower's "visit."

    The "New York Post" wrote yesterday: The President reaffirmed his determination to visit Japan despite the violent situation on Friday (the day Hagerty was surrounded at Tokyo Airport), "perhaps he has no other way to go: If the visit is canceled now, it will be considered a cowardly surrender." But the paper expressed concern that Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan may "not save anything else" except for "saving face."

    An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo yesterday painted an even gloomier picture of Eisenhower's "visit." It wrote: "Given the formidable momentum of the demonstrators in Tokyo, it seems doubtful whether Eisenhower will be able to appear in public here." It then wrote: "If he (Eisenhower) quietly slips in and quietly slips out, what exactly is he trying to prove by making this visit?"

    The dispatch also said, "As for supporting the Kishi Nobusuke government, it may be impossible in the first place. Secondly, even if it succeeds, it may only exacerbate Japan's resentment towards the United States."

    The dispatch also said fearfully, "Japan is experiencing a turbulent period," "riots and demonstrations are not just a superficial phenomenon, too many people are involved, and too much is at stake. A visit by President Eisenhower does not seem likely to change the situation, but it is very likely to make it worse."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th June: Amid the angry roars of the Japanese people shouting "Eisenhower Don't Come!", the US government and the Kishi Nobusuke group, learning from the experience of White House Press Secretary Hagerty escaping the encirclement of the Japanese people at Tokyo Airport, have prepared a helicopter for Eisenhower, who will arrive in Tokyo on June 19th.

    Agence France-Presse reported from Tokyo on the 11th that helicopters have been prepared here. US Presidential Helicopter Pilot Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong of the US Marine Corps "is already in the area." His assistant pilot, Marine Corps Major Donald Firth, was the pilot who rescued Hagerty and US Ambassador MacArthur II from Tokyo International Airport on the 10th.

    Firth said that the damage suffered by the giant ten-seater helicopter that day was "quite serious." Several holes were made in the thinnest part of the fuselage because the demonstrators throwing things found their targets. A stone remains on the cabin floor of the aircraft.

    日本人民的斗争怒涛使华盛顿胆战心惊
    艾森豪威尔访日日程难以肯定
    美报担心此行弄巧成拙更加激起日本人民反美怒潮
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：在日本人民愤怒包围哈格蒂事件发生以后，从美国总统府传出消息说，艾森豪威尔正在“研究”他访问日本的日程表，而且“很可能要修改”。
    白宫助理新闻秘书惠吞夫人11日对记者说，暂时不会发表访问日本的详细计划，要等已经到过东京的哈格蒂作出决定。
    哈格蒂在11日晚间偷偷溜出东京以后，打算立刻在阿拉斯加的安刻拉治会见动身前往远东访问的艾森豪威尔。
    惠吞夫人说，日程表没有肯定，将随着访问的进行随时发布。
    终于，她在记者们一再追问下，承认日程表“可能有些微的修改”。
    11日从东京传出的消息说，日本外务省发言人宣布，哈格蒂同日本官员已经商定取消计划中的艾森豪威尔和岸信介的高尔夫球比赛。此外，原来为艾森豪威尔计划的一次记者招待会也取消了。美联社消息说，东京人士还预料，艾森豪威尔在国会的演说也可能取消。
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的宣传机器无可奈何地承认，日本广大公众反对美日军事条约以及反对艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的怒涛般的群众斗争的发展，使艾森豪威尔出访前夕的华盛顿“笼罩在一片不安的悲惨气氛中”。美国总统先行官、白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在东京机场的遭遇成为昨天所有晚报的触目惊心的头号新闻，报纸并且刊登了哈格蒂狼狈相的照片。电台和电视台从早晨开始就连续报道这些消息。报纸和通讯社都以十分忧郁的调子评论艾森豪威尔这次预兆不祥的出访。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在昨天的社论中一面祈求艾森豪威尔“一路顺风和快乐地抵达”目的地，一面担心地写道：当艾森豪威尔总统开始他的太平洋之行时，“西方地平线上仍然笼罩着日本左翼人士进行骚乱的可怕阴影”。这家报纸认为，这是艾森豪威尔这次“访问”中“一个明确的危险因素”。
    “纽约邮报”昨天写道：总统不顾星期五（即哈格蒂在东京机场被包围的一天）发生的狂暴情况而再次申明他决心访问日本，“也许他是没有其他的路可走了：如果现在取消访问，那将会被认为是怯懦的投降。”但是这家报纸表示忧虑艾森豪威尔对日本的“访问”可能除了“保全面子”以外，将“不会保全住任何别的东西”。
    美联社昨天从东京发出的一条消息对艾森豪威尔的“访问”作了更加灰黯的描绘。它写道：“鉴于东京声势汹汹的示威者的气焰，艾森豪威尔在这里是否能公开露面，看来是值得怀疑的。”接着它又写道：“如果他（艾森豪威尔）悄悄地溜进来又悄悄地溜出去，那么他进行这次访问到底是为了证明什么呢？”
    这条消息又说，“至于支持岸信介政府，这首先也许是不可能的。其次即使会成功，它也许只会加剧了日本对美国的怨恨”。
    这条消息还惶恐不安地说，“日本正在经历一个动荡的时期”，“骚乱和示威并不只是一个表面的现象，参与的人太多了，摩拳擦掌也做得太甚了，艾森豪威尔总统的一次访问看来是不会改变形势的，却很可能把形势弄得更糟”。
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：在日本人民高呼“艾森豪威尔不要来！”的怒吼声中，美国政府和岸信介集团吸取了白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在东京机场逃脱日本人民包围的经验，已经为将在6月19日到达东京的艾森豪威尔准备了直升飞机。
    据法新社11日自东京报道说，这里已经准备了直升飞机。美国总统直升飞机飞行员、美国海军陆战队阿姆斯特朗中校“已经在这个地区”。他的助理飞行员海军陆战队少校唐纳德·弗斯，就是10日把哈格蒂和美国大使麦克阿瑟第二救出东京国际机场的飞行员。
    弗斯说，这架巨型的十人直升飞机哪天所受到的破坏是“颇为严重的”。在机身外壳最薄的地方搞了好几个窟窿，因为投掷东西的示威群众找到了他们的目标。这架飞机的机舱板上还留着一块石头。
