Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Washington Dispatch: American bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on Eisenhower's Far East trip, both admitted the purpose of his trip was to plot aggressive conspiracies and expressed deep concern about his experiences.

Many American newspapers admitted that Eisenhower's visit to the Far East had the clear purpose of strengthening American aggressive activities and military deployments in the Far East. The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 12th, in an editorial, clamored that the United States must maintain its "strength" in this vast region, saying that Eisenhower's visit to the Far East "symbolized the will and goals of the United States in many aspects since the end of World War II." The "New York Times" on the 6th published a commentary from Tokyo stating that Eisenhower's itinerary included places considered to have a "militaristic color," and that this visit was like a "trip to American overseas bases."

The Washington "Evening Star" bluntly pointed out that Eisenhower's arrival in the Far East had an "undoubted" purpose of sheltering the shaky puppet regimes fostered by the United States in the Far East, interfering in the internal affairs of Asian people, and intensifying the implementation of American aggressive policies in the Far East. The newspaper said that in Japan, Eisenhower would try to "strengthen the pro-Western regime," "which is being 'violently attacked' due to negotiations with the United States for a new security treaty." The commentary said that in South Korea, Eisenhower would "demonstrate that the United States hopes that command authority can be transferred in an orderly manner from the old regime of Syngman Rhee to the new regime," and in the Philippines "try to reduce some of the practical and obvious sources of friction between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States."

According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," in Okinawa, Eisenhower would reiterate that "now is obviously not the time for (the United States) to return Okinawa."

While admitting these aggressive conspiracies, many American newspapers were sweating with anxiety about the encounters Eisenhower would face in pursuing these aggressive activities.

"Newsweek" on the 13th, in discussing the situation in several cities Eisenhower was to visit, pointed out that "Anti-American undercurrents are emerging in Manila, South Korea is boiling, and large-scale riots against the pro-American Nobusuke Kishi are still continuing in Tokyo. For days, students have been marching in front of the American Embassy with signs saying 'Ike, go home'." The commentary worried that Eisenhower's Far East trip would become "the most dangerous trip a reigning American president has ever had."

The "New York Times," while insisting that Eisenhower visit as planned, also called this visit "the most contradictory and potentially dangerous undertaking."

A dispatch from Donovan, the "New York Herald Tribune's" Washington commentator familiar with the inside story of the White House, was titled: "The President's Trip Makes the Capital Worry." Donovan, in discussing the massive protests held by the Japanese people when White House Press Secretary Hagerty visited Tokyo, said that Washington officials were greatly disturbed that Eisenhower's visit would trigger a new wave of anger among the Japanese people. The author pointed out that "no American president has ever taken such a risk - personal, diplomatic, and political - as he (Eisenhower)'s trip to Japan."

"New York Times" reporter Trumbull also admitted in an article from Tokyo that recent events in Japan showed that the broad masses of the Japanese people strongly opposed the current Japanese government's policy of dragging Japan into a terrible adventure launched by the United States. He pointed out that "the 'U-2' plane incident has seriously damaged the United States' position in Asia. Washington's prestige has declined; trust in the Eisenhower administration has diminished." Trumbull wrote that the people in all the regions Eisenhower intended to visit opposed the visit.

Trumbull also believed that it was "dangerous and wrong" for American officials to try to "place the responsibility for all unexpected events on the communists." He wrote: "Hagerty encountered many signs written in English: Remember Hiroshima. Obviously, it is correct to say that when Japanese people organized demonstrations against the security treaty, many of them were indeed against war." The author concluded by saying that when Eisenhower comes to the East, he will become a symbol embodying all the incorrect things that Asians see in American policy.

    美国报纸评艾森豪威尔远东之行
    供认美国要加紧策划侵略阴谋  担心亚洲人民将加强反美斗争
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国资产阶级报刊在评论艾森豪威尔的远东之行时，既承认他此行的策划侵略阴谋的目的，又对他的遭遇表示忧心忡忡。
    许多美国报刊承认，艾森豪威尔这次访问远东，具有加强美国在远东的侵略活动和军事部署的明确目的。“纽约先驱论坛报”12日在一篇社论里就叫嚷说美国要维持在这一广大地区的“实力”，说艾森豪威尔对远东的访问“象征了美国自第二次世界大战结束以来在许多方面的意志和目标。”“纽约时报”6日刊载一条发自东京的评论说，艾森豪威尔的访问范围包括被认为“具有军国主义色调”，说这种访问类似一次“对美国海外基地的旅行”。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”直言无讳地指出，艾森豪威尔到远东来，一个“无可怀疑”的目的是为了庇护美国在远东扶植的摇摇欲坠的奴才政权，干涉亚洲人民内政，加紧推行美国在远东的侵略政策。这家报纸说，在日本，艾森豪威尔要设法“加强亲西方政权”，“这个政权正由于同美国谈判新的安全条约”而受到“猛烈攻击”。评论说，在南朝鲜，艾森豪威尔将要“表明美国希望指挥权能够有条不紊地由李承晚的旧政权移交给新政权”，在菲律宾“试图减少菲律宾共和国与美国发生磨擦的一些实际的、显而易见的根源”。
    据“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”说，在冲绳，艾森豪威尔将要重申，“现在显然不是（美国）归还冲绳的时候。”
    在承认这些侵略阴谋的同时，美国许多报刊对艾森豪威尔在推行这种侵略活动时将会碰到的遭遇捏着一把冷汗。
    “新闻周刊”13日在谈到艾森豪威尔将要访问的几个城市的形势时指出，“马尼拉涌现反美暗流，南朝鲜在沸腾，东京大规模反对亲美的岸信介的骚乱仍在继续着。好几天来，学生们拿着‘艾克别来’的标语牌在美国大使馆前游行。”评论担心艾森豪威尔这次远东之行将成为“一个执政的美国总统从未有过的最危险的旅行”。
    “纽约时报”在坚持主张艾森豪威尔按计划出访的同时，也把这次访问称为“最矛盾的、潜藏着危险的事业”。
    熟悉白宫内幕的“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿评论员杜诺万的一篇通讯的标题是：“总统的出访使首都担心受怕”。杜诺万在谈到白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂访问东京时日本人民举行的声势浩大的抗议示威时说，华盛顿官方人士感到极大不安的是，艾森豪威尔的访问会引起日本人民新的愤怒浪潮。作者指出，“还没有哪一个美国总统作过这种冒险，——人身的、外交的和政治的，而他（艾森豪威尔）的出访日本就有着这种冒险”。
    “纽约时报”记者特兰布尔在一篇发自东京的文章中也承认，日本最近的事件表明，日本广大人民群众强烈反对日本现政府旨在把日本卷入美国发动的可怕的冒险中去的政策。他指出，“‘U—2’飞机事件严重地损害了美国在亚洲的地位。华盛顿的威信已经下降；对艾森豪威尔政府的信任已经减少”。特兰布尔写道，艾森豪威尔打算访问的所有地区的人民都反对这次访问。
    特兰布尔并且认为，美国官方力图“把一切意外事件的责任都推在共产党人的身上是危险的和错误的”。他写道：“哈格蒂碰到许多标语牌，上面用英文写着：要记住广岛事件。显然，这样说是正确的，即当日本人组织反对安全条约的示威游行时，的确他们之中许多人是反对战争的。”作者最后说，当艾森豪威尔来到东方的时候，他将成为体现着被亚洲人认为是美国政策中所有不正确的东西的象征。
