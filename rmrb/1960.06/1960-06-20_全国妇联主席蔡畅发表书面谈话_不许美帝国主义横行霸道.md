Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, issued a written statement at a symposium of the All-China Women's Federation. Cai Chang said: "The plague god Eisenhower, harboring the purpose of a robber, came to Asia, and even dared to come to our sacred territory of Taiwan to flaunt his power. This is a public provocation to the 600 million people of our country. We resolutely support our army's shelling of Jinmen and holding anti-American armed demonstrations. The thunderous artillery fire on the Fujian front fully expresses the anger of the people and women of our country, and expresses the solemn protest of the people and women of our country against the aggressive crimes of US imperialism."

Cai Chang pointed out: "US imperialism has done all kinds of bad things. Now an anti-American wave has been set off everywhere, especially in Asia, where there is strong opposition to Eisenhower's robber trip. The Japanese people raised their fists and gave the plague god a rebuff; the Filipino people welcomed him with stones; the Korean people also resolutely opposed his 'visit' to South Korea. It's truly like a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it. Our anti-American armed demonstrations are precisely to support the just struggles of the people of Asia and Africa, to support the just struggles of our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and to express the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for the head of US imperialism, Eisenhower."

Cai Chang said: "Military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, US imperialism has unreasonably occupied Taiwan for ten years. You have seen with your own eyes the American troops stationed in Taiwan committing all kinds of evils, and you have personally suffered their oppression and trampling. Women have been subjected to insults and ravages by beast-like American officers and soldiers. These American troops are sent by US imperialism, and their head is Eisenhower. This time Eisenhower came to Taiwan to strengthen the oppression of Taiwan, to make Taiwan completely reduced to a US colony, and to enslave the compatriots of Taiwan forever. Eisenhower is our common enemy. You must not allow US imperialism to realize its shameless conspiracy. You have engaged in anti-American patriotic struggles, and these struggles are glorious and just. All patriotic compatriots, women, must unite, take action, and cooperate with our army's shelling of Jinmen in the anti-American armed demonstration, and wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors. Oppose US imperialism's occupation of Taiwan, oppose US imperialism's enslavement of the Taiwan compatriots, and drive the robber chief Eisenhower back."

The days when US imperialism could act tyrannically and do whatever it wanted in Asia are gone forever; the lifespan of US imperialism will not be very long. We must unite with all oppressed people in Asia and the world, fight heroically, and overthrow US imperialism.

    全国妇联主席蔡畅发表书面谈话
    不许美帝国主义横行霸道
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅在全国妇联座谈会上发表书面谈话。蔡畅说：瘟神艾森豪威尔怀着强盗的目的来到亚洲，还竟敢来到我国神圣的领土台湾耀武扬威，这是对我国六亿人民的公开挑衅。我们坚决拥护我军炮轰金门，举行反美武装示威。福建前线震天动地的炮声，正充分表达了我国人民和妇女的愤怒，表示了我国人民和妇女对美帝国主义侵略罪行的严正抗议。
    蔡畅指出：美帝国主义做尽了坏事。现在到处掀起了反美浪潮，特别是亚洲各地正强烈反对艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行。日本人民高举拳头，给瘟神吃了闭门羹；菲律宾人民用石头欢迎他；朝鲜人民也坚决反对他到南朝鲜“访问”，真正老鼠过街，人人喊打。我们举行反美武装示威，正是支持亚非人民的正义斗争，支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞的正义斗争，表示了伟大的中国人民对美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。
    蔡畅说：台澎金马的军民同胞们，美帝国主义无理霸占台湾已经十年了，你们亲眼看到侵台美军无恶不作，亲身遭受到他们的压迫和蹂躏，妇女们更受到野兽一样的美军官兵的侮辱和摧残。这些美军是美帝国主义派来的，他们的头子就是艾森豪威尔。这次艾森豪威尔到台湾来，是为了加强对台湾的压迫，使台湾完全沦为美国的殖民地，永远奴役台湾的同胞。艾森豪威尔是我们共同的敌人，你们决不能允许美帝国主义实现无耻的阴谋，你们曾经进行反美爱国斗争，这些斗争是光荣的、正义的。一切有爱国心的同胞们、妇女们，要团结起来，行动起来，配合我军炮轰金门的反美武装示威，同美国侵略者作坚决斗争。反对美帝国主义侵占台湾，反对美帝国主义奴役台湾同胞，把强盗头子艾森豪威尔赶回去。
    美帝国主义在亚洲横行霸道、为所欲为的日子已经一去不复返了；美帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。我们一定要同亚洲和全世界一切被压迫的人民团结起来，英勇地进行斗争，打倒美帝国主义。
