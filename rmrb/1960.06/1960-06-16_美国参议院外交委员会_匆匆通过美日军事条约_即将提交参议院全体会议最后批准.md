Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 15th: The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 14th hastily passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, a product of collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries aimed at promoting aggressive war schemes in Asia and enslaving the Japanese people, and is preparing to submit it to the Senate plenary session on the 16th for final approval.

The committee meeting lasted only twenty minutes before unanimously passing this aggressive military treaty. According to Committee Chairman Fulbright, the meeting discussed whether it would be better to approve the treaty before Eisenhower's arrival in Tokyo on the 19th or after, and those present at the meeting unanimously agreed that it would be "advantageous" to pass the treaty quickly. Sources say that the United States is in such a hurry to pass this treaty in order to present the Japanese people with a fait accompli. Some Congressional figures admit that the United States is clearly "considering" the unfavorable situation of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in doing so. Reuters said: "The members of the Foreign Relations Committee believe that the Senate's rapid passage of this treaty will be a gesture of confidence in Nobusuke Kishi."

In order to cover up the aggressive nature of the treaty and paralyze the increasingly high morale of the Japanese people, Fulbright stubbornly described the treaty, which pushes Japan into the abyss of war, as being "decisively advantageous" to Japan. He also blatantly hinted that the Japanese rulers should make the Japanese people's struggle "subside in the near future." He said that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hopes that "nothing will happen" during Eisenhower's visit to Japan and that "the Japanese people will receive him well."

Senator Wiley, an important member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also issued a threatening statement, interfering in the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people. He slandered the broad masses of the Japanese people who are engaged in anti-American struggle as a "rabble" and threatened aggressively: "The outbreak of anti-American activities in Japan has created a serious situation. … The safety of President Eisenhower (which must be ensured), the future of U.S.-Japan relations, the stability of the Far East economy and military situation—all of this depends to some extent on what the Japanese people and their government do in the future."

    美国参议院外交委员会
    匆匆通过美日军事条约
    即将提交参议院全体会议最后批准
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会14日匆匆通过了美日反动派互相勾结在亚洲推行侵略战争阴谋和奴役日本人民的美日军事同盟条约，并且准备在16日提交参议院全体会议最后批准。
    委员会的会议只举行了二十分钟，就一致通过了这个侵略性军事条约。据委员会主席富布赖特说，会议曾经讨论了在艾森豪威尔19日抵达东京以前批准这个条约好，还是在这以后批准较好，结果出席会议的人一致认为，还是迅速通过条约“有利”。有消息说，美国所以这样急于通过这个条约，为的是要使日本人民面临既成事实。一些国会人士承认，美国在这样做的时候显然是“考虑”到日本首相岸信介的不利处境。路透社说：“外交委员会的委员们认为，参议院的迅速通过这个条约将是对岸信介表示信心的一个姿态。”
    为了掩盖条约的侵略性和麻痹日本人民日益高昂的斗志，富布赖特硬把这个把日本推向战争深渊的条约说成是对日本“决定性有利”的。他还露骨地暗示日本统治者要使日本人民的斗争“在最近的将来平息下去”。他说，美国参议院外交委员会希望艾森豪威尔访问日本时“将不会发生事情，日本人民将好好地接待他。”
    参议院外交委员会的重要委员维利也发表威胁性声明，干涉日本人民的反美斗争。他诬蔑反美斗争的日本广大人民是“乌合之众”，并且咄咄逼人地威胁说：“日本反美活动的爆发造成了严重的局势。……艾森豪威尔总统的安全（这是必须确保的）、美日关系的将来、远东经济和军事情况的稳定——所有这一切，在一定程度上取决于日本人民和他们的政府今后的所作所为。”
