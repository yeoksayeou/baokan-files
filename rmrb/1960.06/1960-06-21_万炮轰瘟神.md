Bombarding the God of Plague with Ten Thousand Cannons

Is it a tsunami? Is it an earthquake? Is it thunder rumbling in June? On the Fujian front, ten thousand cannons bombard the god of plague! Taiwan is a Chinese island; what right does the United States have to it? We ask the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, who welcomes the American god of plague to "visit"? One cannon shatters his "peaceful" disguise, two cannons expose his thieving behavior, thousands upon thousands of cannons strike hard, supporting the people of Asia in their anti-American struggle! Having just been given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people, he is now being bombarded by the Chinese people's cannons. The god of plague trembles with fear, uncertain of his future. Tell the American god of plague: ahead lies the anger of the Okinawan people, the hatred of the South Korean people! Asia is a "volcano" everywhere, with blazing anger driving away the god of plague!

    万炮轰瘟神
    禾君是海啸？是地震？是六月的响雷滚滚？福建前线上，万炮轰瘟神！台湾是中国的岛，哪有美国的份？问台澎金马爱国同胞们，谁欢迎美国瘟神来“访问”？一炮打碎他的“和平”外衣，两炮揭穿他的强盗行径，千炮万炮打得狠，支持亚洲反美斗争的人民！刚吃了日本人民的闭门羹，又遭到中国人民的大炮轰，瘟神心惊胆战，未卜前程吉凶。告诉美国瘟君：前面有的是冲绳人民的愤怒，有的是南朝鲜人民的仇恨！亚洲处处是“火山”，怒火高烧逐瘟神！
