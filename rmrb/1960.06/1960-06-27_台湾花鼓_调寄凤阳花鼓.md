    Taiwan Flower Drum
    --Tune: Fengyang Flower Drum--
    Chi Bei'ou, Poem, Fang Cheng, Painting
    Speaking of Taiwan, talking of Taiwan, Taiwan is originally my territory. Since the arrival of the evil American imperialists, national sovereignty has been devastated; millions of compatriots have been enslaved, suffering ten years of hardship. The beautiful land has become a haunted domain, a human world more miserable than hell. Speaking of Taiwan, talking of Taiwan, Taiwan must not be occupied by others; we must liberate it, drive away the American bandits, plant the red flag on the summit of Jade Mountain, restore the glory of Sun Moon Lake, and ultimately realize the reunification of the motherland, bringing joy to all suffering compatriots.

    台湾花鼓
    ——调寄凤阳花鼓——
    池北偶  诗  方成　画说台湾，道台湾，台湾本是我河山。自从来了恶美帝，民族主权被摧残；千万同胞遭奴役，十年受足十年难。大好河山成鬼域，人间更比地狱惨。说台湾，道台湾，台湾岂容他人占；我们一定要解放，把那美国强盗赶，红旗插在玉山巅，日月重光日月潭，祖国统一终实现，苦难同胞尽欢颜。（附图片）
