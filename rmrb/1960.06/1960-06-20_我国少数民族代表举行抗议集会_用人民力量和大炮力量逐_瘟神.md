Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Eisenhower's bandit-like, criminal trip to Taiwan has aroused immense indignation among the people of all ethnic groups in China. Minority figures in Beijing held an angry protest rally at the Cultural Palace of Nationalities today.

At today's meeting, representatives of various ethnic groups expressed the angry voices of over fifty ethnic groups and more than 35 million minority people in our country. The representatives stated that the people of all ethnic groups in the country firmly support our army's shelling of the "plague god." They said, "The 'plague god' fears the people, the 'plague god' fears artillery fire." We must use the power of the people and the power of artillery fire to send the war leader Eisenhower from the Taiwan Strait and from Asia back to his old home.

Xie Fumin (Zhuang ethnicity), a member of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, condemned Eisenhower, the number one war merchant, for sneaking into our sacred territory of Taiwan yesterday, openly peddling his notorious "Two Chinas" scheme, attempting to separate Taiwan from our motherland and turn it into a colony of U.S. imperialism. This kind of conspiracy will inevitably be resolutely crushed by the people of our country.

Sa Kongliao (Mongolian ethnicity), Vice Chairman of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, said that we resolutely support the People's Liberation Army's shelling of the "plague god." The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country must unite and resolutely drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan.

Jian Bozan (Uyghur ethnicity), a member of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, said that the only way to deal with the war "plague god" is with artillery fire. He said that Eisenhower's bandit trip to Asia has provided a lesson for the people of Asia and the world. This war "plague god's" bandit behavior and war cries tell people that the nature of imperialism will never change. The closer it gets to its demise, the more fiercely, blatantly, and frantically its nature will manifest itself. Imperialism is war.

Sun Ge Badeng (Tibetan ethnicity), Director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing, revealed that the warmonger Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan this time is an attempt to create "Two Chinas" in order to perpetually occupy our country's sacred territory of Taiwan. He expressed deep sympathy and support for the Taiwanese compatriots who are under the oppression and enslavement of U.S. imperialism. He said that when we think of the suffering we have endured from imperialism in the past, we hate U.S. imperialism even more. Eisenhower's criminal activities in Taiwan can only arouse greater anger and hatred towards U.S. imperialism among the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, including the people of Taiwan.

Uyghur representative Mamatov Kurban revealed that Eisenhower is again using the poison he used in the past to poison the people of Taiwan, desperately encouraging "Taiwan independence elements" to create activities to split the motherland. He said that this is a very insidious divisive activity, but our Taiwanese compatriots see the nature of U.S. imperialism clearly. Our compatriots of all ethnic groups will never be fooled, and the Taiwanese compatriots will definitely fight resolutely and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Tian Fuda (Gaoshan ethnicity), a member of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, expressed indignantly in his speech that we Taiwanese are forever the close brothers of the Han people, and we will never become "foreigners."

Tian Fuda said that the people of the Gaoshan ethnic group in Taiwan, like the people of the whole country, absolutely cannot tolerate the war provocations of the warmonger Eisenhower. The Gaoshan people resolutely support the People's Liberation Army's shelling of this "plague god." Our army's powerful artillery fire is a great support and encouragement to the Taiwanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist occupation and for an early liberation and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Tian Fuda exposed a series of conspiracies and tricks by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to plot "Taiwan independence," "Taiwan autonomy," create "Two Chinas," and clamor for "Taiwan for the Taiwanese." We Taiwanese see all this clearly. Their aim in separating Taiwan from the motherland is to turn Taiwan into a colony of U.S. imperialism and make the Taiwanese people its slaves forever.

He firmly pointed out that there has only ever been one China in history, and there is only one China now and in the future. The Gaoshan people of Taiwan are forever a member of the Chinese nation, the close brothers of the Han people, and they are definitely not "foreigners." The Gaoshan people of Taiwan have suffered from the oppression of imperialist colonial rule for more than a hundred years, and they have learned beneficial lessons from this: no matter what sweet words U.S. imperialism uses, it cannot deceive people. It can only further educate our people and arouse greater anti-U.S. struggle.

A total of more than ninety representatives of various ethnic minorities attended today's meeting, including some members of the ethnic minority visiting delegations from six provinces and autonomous regions, namely Fujian, Guizhou, Guangxi, Ningxia, Jilin, and Zhejiang, who are currently visiting Beijing.

    我国少数民族代表举行抗议集会
    用人民力量和大炮力量逐“瘟神”
    据新华社19日讯　艾森豪威尔到台湾进行强盗的罪恶的旅行，激起了我国各族人民极大的愤慨，在京的各少数民族人士今天在民族文化宫举行了愤怒的抗议集会。
    各民族代表在今天会上发言时，表达了我国五十多种民族、三千五百多万少数民族人民愤怒的声音。代表们表示，全国各族人民坚决支持我军炮轰“瘟神”，他们说，“瘟神”怕人民，“瘟神”怕大炮，要用人民的力量，用大炮的力量，把战争头子艾森豪威尔从台湾海峡、从亚洲送回他的老家去。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员谢扶民（僮族）谴责说，艾森豪威尔这个头号战争贩子昨天鬼鬼祟祟地窜到我国神圣领土台湾，公然兜售其臭名昭彰的“两个中国”的鬼计，企图把台湾从我们祖国分割出去，成为美帝国主义的殖民地，这种阴谋必定遭到我国人民的坚决打击。
    民族事务委员会副主任萨空了（蒙族）说，我们坚决拥护人民解放军用大炮轰击“瘟神”，全国各族人民要团结起来，坚决把美帝国主义赶出台湾去。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员翦伯赞（维吾尔族）说，对付战争“瘟神”，只能用大炮。他说，艾森豪威尔在亚洲的强盗旅行，替亚洲人民和世界人民上了一课，这个战争“瘟神”的强盗行为和战争叫嚣，告诉了人们，帝国主义的本质是永远也不会改变的，愈当它走向末日，它的本质就愈以更凶恶、更露骨、更疯狂的形式表现出来。帝国主义就是战争。
    班禅驻京办事处处长孙格巴顿（藏族）揭露说，战争贩子艾森豪威尔这次到台湾，妄图制造“两个中国”，以便永远霸占我国的神圣领土台湾。他对于处在美帝压榨奴役下的台湾同胞表示深深的同情和支援。他说，我们想想过去饱受帝国主义的祸害，就更加痛恨美帝。艾森豪威尔到台湾的罪恶活动，只能激起包括台湾人民在内的中国各族人民对美帝更大的愤怒和仇恨。
    维吾尔族代表马木托夫·库尔班揭露，艾森豪威尔今天又用过去常用的毒药来毒害台湾人民，极力鼓动“台湾独立分子”来制造分裂祖国的活动。他说，这是一种很阴险的分裂活动，但是，我们台湾同胞对美帝的本质是看得清楚的，我们各族同胞绝不会上它的当，台湾同胞一定会坚决斗争，回到祖国的怀抱。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员田富达（高山族）在发言中激愤地表示，我们台湾人永远是汉族的亲兄弟，我们永远也不会成为什么“外国人”。
    田富达说，台湾高山族的人民同全国人民一样，绝不能容忍战争贩子艾森豪威尔的战争挑衅，高山族人民坚决拥护人民解放军用大炮轰击这个“瘟神”。我军强大的炮火，对于台湾人民反对美帝侵占、争取早日解放回到祖国怀抱的斗争，是一个极大的支持和鼓舞的力量。
    田富达揭露了美帝国主义及其走狗策划“台湾独立”、“台湾自治”、制造“两个中国”、叫嚷“台湾人的台湾”等一系列的阴谋鬼计。我们台湾人对这一切是看得清楚的。他们要使台湾脱离祖国，就是为了把台湾变成美帝国主义的殖民地，使台湾人民永远变成它的奴隶。
    他坚定地指出，历史上从来只有一个中国，现在和将来也只有一个中国。台湾高山族永远是中华民族的一个成员，是汉族的亲兄弟，他们决不是什么“外国人”。台湾高山族人民一百多年来受尽了帝国主义殖民统治的压迫，他们从中也获得了有益的教训：不管美帝国主义用什么甜言蜜语，都是骗不了人的，这只能更加教育我们的人民，激起更大的反美斗争。
    出席今天会议的共有九十多位各少数民族的代表，其中包括正在北京参观访问的福建、贵州、广西、宁夏、吉林、浙江等六个省和自治区的各民族参观团的一部分成员。
