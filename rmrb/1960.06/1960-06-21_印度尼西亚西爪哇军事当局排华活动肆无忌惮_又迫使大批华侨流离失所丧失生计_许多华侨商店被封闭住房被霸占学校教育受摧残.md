Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The military authorities in West Java have recently intensified their large-scale forced relocation of Overseas Chinese.

Despite the fact that Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated in his letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi on March 26th that the Indonesian government "has in effect implemented" Ambassador Huang Zhen's demands to "stop the forced relocation and other persecutory activities against Overseas Chinese," the reality is that many Overseas Chinese have once again been displaced and lost their livelihoods due to the forced relocation by the military authorities in West Java. Local military authorities in many areas of this region have recently ordered Overseas Chinese to leave their original places of residence within a very short period of time. These are places where they have long labored alongside the Indonesian people and made beneficial contributions to Indonesia's economic development. For example, the Sixth Military Region Commander Kosasih issued an order on May 31st, stipulating that foreign nationals in Majalaya, Batara Zero, Ujungberung, Cimahi, and Lembang, West Java, must leave those places no later than June 30th. Lieutenant Colonel Sadari, the wartime administrator of the Cibaliung region, issued an order to implement the forced relocation on June 1st. In an order issued on June 9th, the Bandung County military stipulated that foreign nationals ordered to relocate must complete the move by June 20th; those who fail to do so by the deadline will be charged with disobeying the wartime administrator's orders. The wartime administrator of Majalaya also ordered local Overseas Chinese to complete their relocation by June 15th.

While intensifying the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese, many other anti-Chinese incidents have also occurred in the West Java region. In the forced relocation areas such as Cimahi, not only were the small shops of Overseas Chinese closed, but their homes were also arbitrarily sealed with "under supervision" notices, plunging the Overseas Chinese into a tragic situation of being cut off from their livelihoods and becoming displaced. Authorities in Cirebon are coercively collecting "foreign national taxes" from impoverished Overseas Chinese, requiring them to pay the taxes for the past three years within two weeks, and stipulating that their furniture will be sold if they fail to do so by the deadline. The Bandung authorities are also using the excuse of "accommodating" the forcibly relocated Overseas Chinese to seize the houses of Overseas Chinese who have returned to China. Even if only one member of an Overseas Chinese family of several has returned to China, their house is unreasonably sealed off.

The Bandung military authorities have also proposed so-called "streamlining of community organizations" in an attempt to restrict the legitimate activities of Overseas Chinese community organizations, and are using methods such as forcibly borrowing the school buildings of Overseas Chinese schools and prohibiting enrollment to undermine Overseas Chinese education and deprive local Overseas Chinese students of their legitimate right to education.

Under the direction of powerful groups, the military authorities in West Java carried out a large-scale forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in many areas of the region at the end of last year, causing many Overseas Chinese to lose their fortunes and become displaced. During the forced relocation process, Overseas Chinese were also subjected to beatings and imprisonment, some of whom died or were seriously injured as a result. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio had to acknowledge this fact in his letter to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on January 23rd, saying: "The relocation work that has already been carried out will inevitably cause difficulties for those involved and make them feel sad." Overseas Chinese are deeply indignant at the fact that the military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, have once again carried out forced relocation and other persecutory activities against Overseas Chinese.

    印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局排华活动肆无忌惮
    又迫使大批华侨流离失所丧失生计
    许多华侨商店被封闭住房被霸占学校教育受摧残
    新华社19日讯　西爪哇军事当局最近又大规模强迫华侨迁离原居留地。
    尽管印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约曾经在3月26日给中国外交部长陈毅的信中表示：印度尼西亚政府“实际上已经执行了”黄镇大使所提出的“停止对华侨的逼迁和其它迫害活动”的要求，但是事实是，又有许多华侨由于西爪哇军事当局的迫迁而流离失所和丧失生计。这个地区的许多地方军事当局最近都限令华侨在极短期间内迁离他们长期在那里同印度尼西亚人民一起劳动，对印度尼西亚经济发展作出有益贡献的原居留地。如第六军区司令柯沙西在5月31日发布命令，限令西爪哇马者拉夜、巴打拉零、乌绒不龙、芝马圩、和连旺的外侨，必须最迟在6月30日以前离开那些地方。西勃良安州战时掌权者沙达里中校在6月1日发布执行逼迁的命令。万隆县军方在6月9日的命令中规定，被限令迁移的外侨必须在6月20日以前迁移完毕，过期的将以违抗地方战时掌权者的命令论罪。马者拉夜的战时掌权者也限令当地华侨在6月15日以前搬迁完毕。
    在加紧迫迁华侨的同时，西爪哇地区还发生了其它许多排华事件。在芝马圩等迫迁地区，不仅华侨的小商店被封闭，而且他们的住房也被无端贴上了监管的封条，从而使华侨顿时陷于生计断绝、流离失所的悲惨境地。井里汶有关当局正在向贫困的华侨迫缴“外侨税”，规定他们要在两个星期内缴付过去三年的税，并规定过期就变卖他们的家具。万隆有关当局还以“收容”被迫迁的华侨为借口来霸占归国华侨的房屋。一家数口的华侨虽然只有一个人回了国，他们的住屋也被无理标封。
    万隆军事当局还提出所谓“简化社团”，企图限制华侨社团的正当活动，并用强借华侨学校校舍和禁止招生等办法来摧残华侨教育，剥夺当地华侨学生求学的正当权利。
    西爪哇军事当局在有势力集团的指使下，在去年底曾大规模地对这一地区许多地方的华侨实行迫迁，使许多华侨倾家荡产、流离失所。在迫迁过程中，华侨还遭受毒打和监禁，其中有些因而死亡和受重伤。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在1月23日给陈毅外交部长的信中也不得不承认这个事实，他说：“已经进行的迁移工作一定会给有关的人造成困难和使他们感到伤心”。华侨对于印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局竟然再次对华侨进行迫迁和其他迫害活动，感到十分愤慨。
