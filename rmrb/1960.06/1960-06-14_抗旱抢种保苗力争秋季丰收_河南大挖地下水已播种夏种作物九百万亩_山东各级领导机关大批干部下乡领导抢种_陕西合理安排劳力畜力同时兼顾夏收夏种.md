Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 13th: In Henan Province, as the summer harvest is nearing completion, a new high tide of fighting drought and rushing to plant is being launched with great momentum to ensure successful and sufficient planting even without rain. According to statistics from June 4th, the province has already sown nine million mu of summer crops.

Since late May, drought conditions have reemerged in many areas of Henan Province. The flow of major rivers has gradually decreased, and the water storage in reservoirs throughout the province is more than fifty billion cubic meters less than the same period last year. Faced with the continued development of the drought, the people of the province have launched a battle against the disaster. In the Kaifeng Special District, where the wheat harvest has ended, aside from retaining some labor for intensive re-harvesting and meticulous threshing, 70% of the labor force has been shifted to fighting drought, rushing to plant, and protecting seedlings. As a result, the daily progress of summer planting in the district has reached more than 878,000 mu. In the Xinyang Special District, where the summer harvest has basically ended, more than four million mu of summer-sown crops have been planted.

The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to carry forward the spirit of vigorously drilling wells and tapping groundwater as they did this spring in fighting drought and rushing to plant. With the same energy and determination, a large-scale movement to tap groundwater should be launched. The Kaifeng Special District is conducting a comprehensive survey of water sources. All reservoirs, ponds, ditches, canals, and wells are being utilized. In areas with insufficient water sources, the drilling of wells is being accelerated, irrigation canals and field projects are being repaired, shallow wells are being renovated, and ponds are being strengthened to ensure that every drop of water is returned to the fields. Guaihe Commune in Fangcheng County organized manpower and resources to blast mountains and open canals, solving the problem of 7,000 mu of land in Wangqiao Brigade that could not be irrigated for years due to lack of water.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 13th: While rushing to harvest wheat, the people of Shandong are seizing the time and making every second count to actively carry out the struggle to fight drought, rush planting, and protect seedlings, striving to exceed contracted production and plans. In areas where wheat matures early and is harvested quickly, the movement to fight drought, rush planting, and protect seedlings has begun to form a high tide.

Currently, many small rivers in Shandong Province have stopped flowing; many small reservoirs and ponds have also dried up; the groundwater level has greatly decreased, and a few wells have also dried up. Fields with soil moisture content below 10% account for about 40% of the drought-affected area. This situation is very unfavorable for summer sowing. On the basis of winning a bumper summer harvest by fighting drought, the people of Shandong have launched a magnificent movement to fight drought and rush planting. The seventy-six shock teams of Geshi Commune in Ningyang County are developing water sources extensively, striving to "use every drop of water and return all water to the fields." After seven days of hard work, they dug out thirty-two mountain springs, dammed sixteen rivers, and repaired thirty large and small canals, totaling more than one hundred li in length, expanding the irrigation area by more than 5,000 mu and rushing to plant more than 10,000 mu of autumn crops. In the Liaocheng Special District, located on the alluvial plain of western Shandong, in order to ensure high speed and high quality in summer production, based on the experience of drought-resistant wheat harvest, the district has launched a upsurge of grasping the "five-character measures" : early (early drought-resistant planting), more (planting more high-yield crops), good (plowing and stubble removal, applying sufficient base fertilizer, building high-yield fields, and standardizing planting), dense (close planting), and protection (guaranteeing the normal development of spring seedlings). At present, more than ten billion jin of high-quality fertilizer have been transported to the fields throughout the district.

In order to carry out the movement of fighting drought and rushing to plant more widely and deeply, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee decided to transfer one-half of the leading force from the provincial-level organs and two-thirds of the capable cadres from the prefectural and municipal levels to strengthen the leadership of the front line of summer production as soon as possible, and to mobilize deeply for drought-resistant sowing to ensure the normal development of seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 13th: While harvesting summer-ripening crops, Shaanxi Province is actively carrying out drought-resistant summer planting. According to incomplete statistics, the summer sowing area of several major crops such as cotton, rice, corn, and tubers has now reached more than 20% of the planned area, and it is expected that it can be basically completed around June 15th.

This year, almost all of the summer harvest fields in Shaanxi Province have to be replanted, so the workload is large and labor and livestock power is tight. The people's communes in various places are promoting the superiority of "large-scale and public ownership," rationally using labor and livestock power and arranging work. In Xingping County and Xianyang City, each commune organized all the labor force into two groups, adopting a method of division and combination. In the morning and evening, they concentrated on rushing to plant autumn crops, and at noon they threshed the grain, ensuring that both planting autumn crops and threshing were not delayed. Xinle Commune in Hanzhong City organized 10,000 laborers into specialized teams for harvesting, releasing water, plowing fields, and transplanting seedlings, launching a red flag competition. In nine days, they stored more than 12,000 cubic meters of water, plowed all 18,000 mu of wheat fields that had just been harvested, and also transplanted more than 3,000 mu of seedlings.

    抗旱抢种保苗力争秋季丰收
    河南大挖地下水已播种夏种作物九百万亩
    山东各级领导机关大批干部下乡领导抢种
    陕西合理安排劳力畜力同时兼顾夏收夏种
    据新华社郑州13日电　河南省广大地区，随着夏收即将结束，掀起了一个千军万马的新的抗旱抢种高潮。保证无雨也要种好，种足。到6月4日统计，全省已播种夏种作物九百万亩。
    5月下旬以来，河南省各地又普遍呈现旱象，各主要河道流量都日渐减少，全省水库蓄水量也比去年同期减少五十多亿立方米，在干旱继续发展的情况下，全省广大人民向旱灾展开了搏斗。开封专区麦收已经结束的地区，除留一部分劳力突击复收细打外，70％的劳力都已转入抗旱抢种保苗，因而全区每天夏种日进度达到八十七万八千多亩。夏收已经基本结束的信阳专区，全区已种上夏播作物四百多万亩。
    省委要求各地在抗旱抢种中，拿出今春大打机井、开挖地下水的劲头来，一股劲、一个决心，开展一个大挖地下水运动。开封专区全区进行水源大排队，所有水库、坑塘、沟河、渠道、水井全部利用，水源不足地区，加速打机井，整修灌溉渠道和田间工程，整修改造浅井，加强坑塘，作到滴水归田。方城县拐河公社组织人力、物力炸山开渠，解决了王桥大队七千亩历年来无水不能浇的困难。
    据新华社济南13日电　山东人民在抢收小麦同时，抢时间，夺分秒，积极开展抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗斗争，力争超包产、超计划。小麦成熟早收割快的地区，抗旱抢种保苗运动已经开始形成高潮。
    目前，山东省内许多小河断流；小水库和塘坝也干涸了许多，地下水位大大降低，有少数水井也干了。土壤含水量10％以下的田约占受旱面积的40％左右。这种情况，对夏播十分不利。山东人民在抗旱夺得夏季丰收的基础上，又开展了气壮山河的抗旱抢种运动。宁阳县葛石公社的七十六个突击组广辟水源，力争“滴水皆用，万水归田”。他们奋战七天，挖出山泉三十二个，拦河十六条，修大小渠道三十条、共长一百多里，扩大灌溉面积五千多亩，抢种了一万多亩大秋作物。鲁西冲积平原上的聊城专区，为保证夏季生产高速度高质量，根据小麦抗旱丰收经验，全区掀起了大抓早（抗旱早种）、多（多种高产作物）、好（翻耕灭茬，施足底肥，建丰产田，种植规格化）、密（密植）、保（保证春苗正常发育）五字措施的热潮。现在，全区运到田间的优质肥料已达一百多亿斤。
    为了更广泛更深入地开展抗旱抢种运动，中共山东省委决定从省级机关调二分之一的领导力量，专市调三分之二的得力干部从速加强夏季生产第一线的领导。深入动员抗旱播种，保证禾苗正常发育。
    据新华社西安13日电　陕西省在收割夏熟作物的同时，正积极进行抗旱夏种。据不完全统计，现在棉花、水稻、玉米、薯类等几项主要作物的夏播面积已达计划面积20％以上，预计一般在6月15日左右可以基本播种完毕。
    今年陕西省夏收田几乎全部都要复种，因此工作量大，劳畜力紧张。各地人民公社发扬一大二公的优越性，合理使用劳力畜力和安排活路。兴平县、咸阳市各公社把全部劳力组成两套人马，采取有分有合的办法，早上晚上集中突击种秋，中午碾场脱粒，作到了种秋、碾场两不误。汉中市新乐公社把万名劳力组成收割、放水、犁田、插秧等专业队，开展红旗竞赛，九天蓄水一万二千多立方米，刚收割的一万八千亩麦田全部翻犁，还插秧三千多亩。（附图片）
