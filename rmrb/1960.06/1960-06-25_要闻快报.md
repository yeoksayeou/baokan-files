　　Hubei Provincial Party Committee Calls on the Entire Province to Conserve Grain
　　The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a letter to cadres and members of production teams and production sub-teams throughout the province on the 22nd, calling for thriftiness despite the good harvest. The letter stated that grain is the most precious treasure and should not be wasted at any time. In order to conserve grain, the Provincial Party Committee first requested that all regions thresh all wheat before the arrival of the rainy season, dry it, winnow it, and send it to the warehouses. Canteens should plan their grain consumption, calculating before eating, "It is better for the beginning of the storage to be tight than for the end to be tight." More vegetables should be grown, as only with more vegetables can people eat better and effectively conserve grain. Cadres should take the lead in conserving grain and leading a good life.
  Sichuan and Jiangxi Launch Summer Manure Collection and Fertilizer Production Campaign
　　Sichuan's rural areas are systematically collecting and producing manure to prepare fertilizer for major spring crops. Various regions are focusing on raising pigs to accumulate manure, extensively collecting green manure, utilizing some small spring crop stalks to compost fertilizer, and extensively producing indigenous chemical fertilizers. The prepared fertilizer is being transported to the fields in succession. While extensively collecting farm manure in Jiangxi, various regions are also stepping up the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers. Currently, there are over 10,000 restored and newly built indigenous chemical fertilizer plants throughout the province. Many regions are using clam shell powder, soil nitrate, and straw seed shells as raw materials to process and manufacture potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate.

　　Farmers in Sangri County, Tibet, Manufacture Indigenous Pesticides
　　Farmers in Chengpa Township, Sangri County, on the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, have formulated more than 230,000 jin of indigenous pesticides mixed with manure, based on 13 secret recipes for poisonous weeds contributed by the masses, killing pests on over 1,200 ke (equivalent to mu) of farmland, becoming the first pest-free township in Tibet.
　　For thousands of years, Tibetan farmers have been deeply bound by the feudal serf system and feudal superstitious ideas. They dared not treat insects and pests, resigned themselves to fate, and allowed pests to run rampant. Today, with the political and economic emancipation of the broad masses of working people in Tibet, their spiritual outlook has also undergone drastic changes. Farmers have become masters of nature and no longer allow pests to run rampant.
