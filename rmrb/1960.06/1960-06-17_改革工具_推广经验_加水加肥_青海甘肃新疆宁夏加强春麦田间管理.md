Reform Tools　Promote Experience　Add Water and Fertilizer
Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Ningxia Strengthen Spring Wheat Field Management

Qinghai Reforms Weeding Tools, Significantly Improving Efficiency
Xinhua News Agency Report: In order to comprehensively improve field management of spring-sown crops, mainly spring wheat and highland barley, agricultural tool factories at all levels in Qinghai Province have launched a vigorous mass movement to reform tools, focusing on weeding implements.

The area sown to spring crops in Qinghai has expanded significantly compared to last year. Therefore, properly organizing labor, vigorously reforming tools, and increasing labor productivity are crucial to comprehensively improving field management. Near the end of the sowing season, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly called on people of all ethnic groups to build on the foundation of planting more, planting early, and planting well, to advance victoriously, to fully utilize the superiority of the people's communes and the power of commune-run industries, to vigorously reform tools, focusing on weeding implements, to improve labor organization, and to ensure highly efficient and high-quality comprehensive field management, achieving greater yields and higher production. Under the active leadership of party committees at all levels, the field management tool reform movement rapidly unfolded throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from the two Tibetan autonomous prefectures of Huangnan and Hainan, and the four counties of Huangyuan and Hualong, more than 100,000 hoes have already been manufactured and promoted, including long-handled hoes, hollow hoes, double-headed hoes, three-pronged hoes, and three-toothed weeding hoes, as well as many created and imitated weeding tools. These machines have increased weeding efficiency by several to dozens of times. Minhe County, which took the lead in land reclamation and spring sowing, used hoes for all weeding, greatly increasing efficiency compared to using shovels in the past. Tibetan commune members in Tongren County, who previously used ox horns to weed small plots of land, have successively taken off their long-sleeved Tibetan robes, put on lightweight short outfits, and are using hoes to weed. The No. 1 branch of the Haomen United Enterprise Company recently manufactured a push-type weeder that is five to six times more efficient than the original hand shovel weeding method; a tractor-drawn weeder increases efficiency by eight to ten times. These two types of weeders are light and easy to use, and can be adjusted according to the softness of the soil, the density of the crops, and the depth and spacing of the rows during operation. The horse-drawn potato weeding machine created by the Anmenxia Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County can weed more than 20 mu per day, increasing efficiency by about ten times.

The reform of weeding tools has driven the overall innovation of field management tools. Various localities throughout the province have created many new tools suitable for different natural conditions for watering, topdressing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, beginning to form a new situation of comprehensive reform of field management tools. In addition to reforming and promoting weeding tools, the Delingha Farm has also created 62 new agricultural and pastoral production tools, such as land levelers, furrow openers, and automatic fertilizer spreaders, and more than 10,000 of them have now been promoted. The powder spray gun manufactured by the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County Agricultural Tool Factory can be operated by one person to prevent and control pests on more than 50 mu of land per day, and can also avoid damaging seedlings. At present, Qinghai Province's agricultural tool reform work has formed a mass movement with clear direction, prominent focus, from point to surface, and from low to high characteristics.

In Qinghai Province, field management centered on weeding has become the overriding central task in the countryside. In Minhe County, after completing the first weeding of 510,000 mu of field crops by the end of May, the people of the county took advantage of the victory to advance vigorously and completed the second weeding of more than 280,000 mu in one fell swoop. Currently, more than 40,000 people in Ledu County are engaged in field management, and they have completed the first weeding of more than 450,000 mu. In addition, they have also launched watering, topdressing, and pest control work.

In order to effectively carry out field management, many regions have had five-level cadres converge in the fields to lead the masses in carrying out major inspections, major comparisons, and major competitions, constantly pushing the field management movement to a climax.

Gansu's Five-Level Cadres Go to the Fields
Promote Experience in Preserving Grain and Ears
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Five-level cadres in Gansu Province have converged in the fields to strengthen spring wheat field management and strive to manage every plot well and achieve a bumper harvest on every mu.

This year, the area sown to spring wheat in Gansu Province has expanded by about 300,000 mu compared to last year. At present, spring wheat in the Longdong and Longnan areas is flowering and filling; spring wheat in the Gannan, Linxia, and Ziwuling areas has jointed and is heading; and the large tracts of wheat fields in the Hexi Corridor, which were sown slightly later, are also lush, with strong stalks and lush leaves.

In order to further improve field management and win a bumper harvest of spring wheat this year, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized five-level cadres from the province, prefecture, county, commune, and team to go deep into the fields, participate in production, lead production, and summarize and promote advanced production experiences in drought resistance, seedling preservation, ear preservation, grain preservation, and yield preservation, tailored to local conditions.

Xinjiang Digs Wells to Divert Water
Guarantee Timely Irrigation of Wheat Fields
Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: Spring wheat in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is growing well and is generally heading and flowering. People's communes and farms in various localities are continuing their efforts, focusing on water and fertilizer, and are vigorously grasping the late-stage management of spring wheat.

Since the beginning of spring this year, the temperature in various parts of the autonomous region has risen slowly, snowmelt in the mountains has been delayed, and the water volume in many rivers has been low. In order to ensure the irrigation of spring wheat, various localities are currently trying every means to open up new water sources. Mountainous areas have adopted methods such as breaking ice and melting snow and digging wells and springs to try to increase the amount of water. The Balikun Kazakh Autonomous County organized 7,000 laborers to go to the mountains to melt ice and snow and divert water down the mountain. Dahe Commune in the county dug more than 1,200 springs in two days. Various localities are also vigorously conserving and managing water, and are trying to improve the utilization rate of water as much as possible. The Hotan Special District put forward the slogan "Secretary at the source, cadres follow the water, vigorously dig water sources, use water like oil," so that spring wheat in the entire special district has been watered three times, and most of it has been watered four times, even Pishan County, which has the most serious water shortage, has been watered three times. While combining irrigation, various localities have tried every means to apply more fertilizer and apply good fertilizer to spring wheat. Many communes in southern Xinjiang have adopted methods such as establishing field fertilizer pits to increase the amount of fertilizer applied to spring wheat. In addition to applying more high-quality fertilizer to Category III wheat fields, various localities have also applied quick-acting chemical fertilizer.

Ningxia Skillfully Cultivates and Finely Topdresses
Category I Wheat Continuously Increases
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: After continuous processing and management, the spring wheat in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is growing better and better. Whether it is the fertile Yellow River Plain irrigation area or the undulating hilly southern mountain area, everywhere is a good scene of a bumper harvest in sight.

The current field management work for wheat fields throughout the region mainly includes topdressing, irrigation, and cultivating and weeding. By the end of May, more than 240,000 mu of wheat fields throughout the region had been weeded twice, and more than 980,000 mu had been topdressed once or twice. In the irrigation area, the amount of farm manure applied is generally three to five carts per mu, 300 to 500 jin of soil fertilizer, and 10 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate. Many areas have also specially applied wood ash to Category I fields and nitrogen fertilizer to Category III fields. Irrigation work in many areas has also been carried out in a timely manner. At present, 970,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated for the first time, and 490,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated for the second time.

After continuous processing and management of wheat fields in various localities, Category I fields have increased significantly, and Category III fields have been greatly reduced. In the southern mountainous area of Guyuan Special District, Category III fields have decreased from the original 20% to 15%. (Attached picture)

    改革工具　推广经验　加水加肥
    青海甘肃新疆宁夏加强春麦田间管理
    青海改革中耕工具除草工效显著提高
    本报讯　为了全面搞好以春小麦青稞为主的春播作物的田间管理，青海省各级农具厂以除草工具为主，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性工具改革运动。
    青海春种作物面积比去年扩大很多，因此，妥善地组织劳力，大搞工具改革，提高劳动生产率是全面搞好田间管理的关键。中共青海省委在播种基本结束时，就及时号召各族人民在种多种早种好的基础上，乘胜前进，充分发挥人民公社的优越性和社办工业的威力，大搞以除草工具为主的工具改革，改善劳动组织，保证高效率、高质量地全面搞好田间管理，实现多种多收、高产多收。在各级党委的积极领导下，田间管理工具改革运动迅速在全省开展起来。据黄南、海南两个藏族自治州和湟源、化隆四个县的不完全统计，目前已制造、推广了长把锄、空心锄、双头锄、三叉锄、三齿耘锄等锄头十万多件，还有许多创造、仿制的除草工具。这些机具几倍、十几倍地提高了除草效率。在开荒、春播中一马当先的民和县，全部使用锄头除草，比过去用铲子除草大大地提高了效率。过去用牛角在小块土地上除草的同仁县藏族社员，纷纷脱下长袖的藏袍，穿上轻便的短装，使用锄头除草。浩门联合企业公司第一分场，最近制成了手推式锄草器比原来使用手铲除草工效高五倍到六倍；牵引式锄草器提高工效八倍到十倍。这两种锄草器使用轻巧，操作时可以根据土质软硬，作物稠稀，加以调节，松土可深可浅，行距可大可小。互助土族自治县闇门峡公社创造的马拉洋芋铲草机，一天能除草二十多亩，提高工效十倍左右。
    除草工具的改革，带动了田间管理工具的全面革新。全省各地已经创制出许多适合不同自然条件的浇水、追肥、防治病虫害的新工具，开始形成成套改革田间管理工具的新局面。德令哈农场除了改革和推广了除草工具外，还创造了土地平整器、扶垅开沟器、自动撒肥车等六十二种农牧业生产新工具，现已推广一万多件。互助土族自治县农具厂制成的喷粉炮，一人操作一天的防治虫害面积达五十多亩，而且可以避免伤苗。现在青海省的农具改革工作，已经形成具有方向明确、重点突出、由点到面、由低到高等特点的全民运动。
    青海省以除草为中心的田间管理，已经成为当前农村压倒一切的中心任务。民和县在五月底除完成五十一万亩大田作物的头草之后，全县人民乘胜猛进，又一举除完二草二十八万多亩。乐都县目前投入田间管理的劳力有四万多人，现已除头遍草四十五万多亩，此外还展开了浇水、追肥、防治病虫害等工作。
    为了切实搞好田间管理，许多地区五级干部会师田间，领导群众开展了大检查、大评比、大竞赛，把田间管理运动不断地推向高潮。
  甘肃五级干部下田
  推广保粒保穗经验
    新华社兰州讯　甘肃省五级干部会师田间，加强春小麦田间管理，力争实现块块都管好，亩亩大丰收。
    今年甘肃省的春小麦比去年扩大了三十万亩左右。目前，陇东和陇南地区的春小麦正在扬花灌浆；甘南、临夏和子午岭一带的春小麦已拔节孕穗；播种稍迟的河西走廊，大片麦田也是一片葱茏，秆壮叶茂。
    为了进一步搞好田间管理工作，夺得今年春小麦大丰收，最近中共甘肃省委组织省、地、县、社、队五级干部深入田间，参加生产领导生产，因地制宜地总结和推广抗旱保苗、保穗、保粒、保收等先进生产经验。
    新疆挖泉引水
  保证麦田适时浇灌
    新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区的春麦生长良好，普遍抽穗扬花，各地人民公社和农场正再接再厉，以水肥为中心，狠抓春麦的后期管理。
    今年入春以来，自治区各地气温上升缓慢，山间积雪融化迟，许多河流水量较少。各地为了保证春小麦的灌溉，目前正千方百计增辟水源。靠山地区采取了破冰化雪和打井、挖泉等办法，努力增加水量。巴里坤哈萨克自治县组织了七千劳力上山融冰化雪，引水下山。这个县的大河公社两天内就挖泉一千二百多个。各地还大力保水、管水，尽量提高水的利用率。和田专区提出了“书记上源口，干部跟水走，大力挖水源，用水如用油”的口号，使全专区春麦全部浇了三次水，大部已浇了四次水，连缺水最严重的皮山县也浇了三次水。各地在结合灌溉同时，都千方百计给春麦多追肥、追好肥。南疆不少公社采用建立田间肥坑等方法，来增加春麦的施肥量。对三类麦田，各地除多施优质肥外，还追施了速效化肥。
  宁夏巧中耕细追肥
  一类麦不断增加
    新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区的春小麦，经过不断加工管理，生长情况愈来愈好，不论是千里沃野的黄河平原灌溉区，或是丘陵起伏的南部山区，到处是一片丰收在望的大好景象。
    当前全区麦田的田间管理工作，主要是追肥、灌水和中耕锄草。到5月底为止，全区锄草两遍的麦田有二十四万多亩，追肥一次到两次的有九十八万多亩。灌区追肥量一般每亩施农家肥三至五车，土化肥三百到五百斤，硫酸铵十至二十斤。许多地区还特别给一类田施了草木灰，给三类田施了氮肥。许多地区的灌水工作也进行得比较适时，目前已有九十七万亩麦田灌了头水，有四十九万亩麦田灌了二次水。
    各地麦田经过不断加工管理，一类田显著增加，三类田大大减少。南部山区的固原专区三类田已由原来的20％下降到15％。（附图片）
