    New People of the Commune
    Li Xiaobai

    Agricultural expert, just
    On this piece of land,
    The landlord stripped away his tattered cotton-padded coat;
    Enduring hunger and beatings,
    Tears flowed countless times;
    His bones were bent by the load!
    His beard was whitened by wind and frost!
    Just on this piece of land,
    He welcomed days of happiness,
    Yesterday, an electric waterwheel was installed,
    Today, a tractor comes to report;
    He'd rather have the nursing home's chair empty,
    He wants to collect his debts from the land.
    Just on this piece of land,
    He irrigates life with his heart's blood;
    Grafting beans onto pumpkin vines,
    Cotton bolls grow on Ailanthus trees...
    He knows the soil's character well,
    Walking on the brilliant road along the General Line.
    Just on this piece of land,
    Drums beat and colorful flags flutter,
    Hundreds and thousands of representatives and college students,
    Come to listen to the expert's report,
    The secretary helps him onto the podium,
    He weeps and smiles incessantly.

    Old Woman of the Mountain Village

    Gray hair flying, sweat dripping,
    Having finished cutting the wheat and spreading it on the threshing floor,
    Smiling as she watches the wheat pile grow higher and higher,
    Her heart calculates the harvest's accounts,
    Carrying her sickle, walking back,
    Someone calls to her from behind, "Auntie,"
    "Team Leader, we're one short,
    Let's play cards and cool off."
    The old woman smiles and turns her head to say:
    "I don't have time, please excuse me;
    The newspaper called yesterday,
    Asking me to write a short article."

    公社新人
    李晓白
    农业专家就
    就在这块土地上，
    地主剥走他的破棉袄；
    经受着饥饿和鞭打，
    泪珠不知流过多少；
    骨头被担子压弯了！
    胡子被风霜染白了！
    就在这块土地上，
    把幸福的日子迎来了，
    昨天装上电动水车，
    今天拖拉机又来报到；
    宁让敬老院的椅子空着，
    他要向土地把债讨。
    就在这块土地上，
    他用心血把生活灌浇；
    把豆子嫁接在南瓜蔓上，
    椿树上结下了棉桃……
    他摸熟了泥土的性格，
    沿着总路线走上灿烂的大道。
    就在这块土地上，
    敲锣打鼓彩旗飘，
    千百名代表、大学生，
    来听专家的报告，
    书记扶着他走上讲台，
    他流着眼泪不住地笑。
    山村老大娘
    苍发飘飘汗珠淌，
    割完了麦子洒好了场，
    笑看麦堆步步高，
    心儿在算丰收账，
    提着镰刀往回走，
    后边有人喊大娘，
    “队长呀，三缺一，
    打打扑克乘乘凉。”
    大娘笑着回头说：
    “没工夫呵请原谅；
    报社昨天打电话，
    要我写篇小文章。”
