Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: People from all walks of life in Wuhan, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and other places have recently held rallies and discussions, unanimously expressing their opposition to American imperialist aggression and their determination to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace.

    At a rally in Wuhan, Liu Guo, a combat hero from a naval unit who participated in the liberation of Hainan Island, said excitedly, "The god of war, Eisenhower, has crept onto our territory of Taiwan to plot aggression and create the 'two Chinas' conspiracy, which makes us very angry." He said, "In the past, we were able to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army, armed by American imperialism, even with inferior equipment. Today, we have even more confidence and strength to liberate Taiwan and drive away American imperialism." More than eighty retired veteran workers from the "February 7th" strike could not restrain their anger and also held a rally on the 23rd to denounce the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. Wang Zhihuai, an elderly man who served as the captain of the workers' pickets during the "February 7th" strike, used his personal experience to expose the consistent crimes of imperialism in invading China. Taiwanese compatriots studying in Wuhan also held a rally, expressing their determination to contribute everything to the liberation of the motherland's territory of Taiwan.

    Many factories, mines, rural people's communes, institutions, and schools in Chongqing held rallies. After participating in the rallies, many military families wrote letters to their relatives in the army, urging them to be vigilant and resolutely defend the motherland. Some People's Liberation Army soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and militiamen also wrote letters and articles to newspapers, expressing their determination to fight American imperialism to the end. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the 610 Textile Factory, Chongqing University and other units held literary and art evenings, garden parties, and poetry recitations on the evening of the 24th with the theme of opposing American imperialism.

    At an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the CPPCC, Jiyatay (Mongolian), vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, said, "The 'plague god' Eisenhower is opposed and attacked by the people wherever he goes, which fully shows that American imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world." Sun Lanfeng, vice chairman of the China Peace Committee of Inner Mongolia and vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that American imperialism's attempt to annex Taiwan and realize its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. Li Shijie, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, Baladen (Mongolian), secretary-general of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region branch of the Buddhist Association of China, and others also spoke at the meeting, angrily condemning Eisenhower's gangster trip.

    People's militia of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province have recently held rallies and discussions. Zhu Mingliang (Hani), a militia hero who attended the National Militia Representative Conference, said angrily at the meeting: "A wolf is a wolf. Eisenhower's Far East trip fully exposed the aggressive nature of American imperialism. If we want to defend peace, we must fight American imperialism to the end." Ai Men, a Tibetan "Five-Good" militiaman, said: "American imperialism has always been the deadly enemy of our people of all ethnic groups. In the old society, it colluded with reactionaries to oppress us. Now that we are liberated, it is even more hostile to us. We must unite, overthrow American imperialism, and liberate Taiwan."

    武汉重庆内蒙古云南人民集会愤怒表示
    一定要解放我国领土台湾
    据新华社25日讯　武汉、重庆、内蒙古、云南等地各界人士，近日纷纷集会、座谈，一致表示：反对美帝侵略，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平。
    在武汉市的一次集会上，曾经参加过解放海南岛战役的海军某部战斗英雄刘国激动地说，战争瘟神艾森豪威尔爬到我国领土台湾来策划侵略和制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，我们感到非常愤怒。他说，过去我们在装备较差的条件下能够打败美帝国主义武装起来的蒋介石集团的军队，今天我们更有信心和力量解放台湾，赶走美帝国主义。八十多位退休的“二七”老工人，按捺不住心中的怒火，23日也集会声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。“二七”大罢工时担任工人纠察队长的王植槐老人，用亲身经历的史实，揭露帝国主义一贯侵略中国的罪行。在武汉学习的台湾同胞也举行了集会，表示决心为解放祖国领土台湾贡献自己的一切。
    重庆市许多厂矿、城乡人民公社、机关和学校举行了集会。许多军属在参加集会以后，向在部队里的亲人写信，要他们提高警惕，坚决保卫祖国。一些解放军战士，复员转业军人和民兵还纷纷向报纸写信写文章，表示坚决同美帝国主义斗争到底。重庆钢铁公司、六一○纺织厂和重庆大学等单位并在24日晚举行以反对美帝国主义为内容的文艺晚会、游园晚会和诗歌朗诵会。
    在政协内蒙古自治区委员会召开的常委扩大会议上，内蒙古政协副主席吉雅泰（蒙古族）说，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔走到那里就遭到那里人民的反对和打击，这充分说明了美帝国主义是全世界人民的头号敌人。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会内蒙古分会副主席、内蒙古自治区副主席孙兰峰说，美帝国主义妄图吞并台湾，实现其制造“两个中国”的阴谋，这是中国人民所绝对不能允许的。中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要完成伟大祖国的统一事业。内蒙古政协副主席李世杰、中国佛教协会内蒙古自治区分会秘书长巴拉登（蒙古族）等人都在会上讲了话，愤怒谴责艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行。
    云南省各族男女民兵，近日纷纷举行集会、座谈。出席全国民兵代表会议的民兵英雄朱明亮（哈尼族）在会上愤怒地说：“狼就是狼，这次艾森豪威尔的远东旅行，充分暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本质，我们要保卫和平，就必须同美帝国主义斗争到底。”藏族五好民兵艾门说：“美帝国主义从来就是我们各族人民的死敌，在旧社会它就勾结反动派压迫我们，现在我们解放了，它更加敌视我们。我们要团结起来，打倒美帝国主义，解放台湾。”
