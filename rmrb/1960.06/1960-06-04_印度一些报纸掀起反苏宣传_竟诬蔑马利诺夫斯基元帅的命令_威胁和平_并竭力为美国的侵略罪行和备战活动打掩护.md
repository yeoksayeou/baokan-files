Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Some Indian newspapers have recently stirred up anti-Soviet propaganda again regarding the order issued by Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Rocket Forces on May 30th. They have slandered this stern warning from the Soviet Union, directed at warmongers and their accomplices, as "launching a nuclear war" and "threatening peace."

According to Indian news reports, the Indian newspaper "The Statesman" on June 1st污蔑 said that Marshal Malinovsky's "rude and uncompromising manner is tantamount to threatening to launch a nuclear war. This is the most dangerous brinkmanship since the Americans publicly advocated using atomic bombs in Indochina."

This newspaper also denigrated the world's public opinion's solemn condemnation of the US spy plane's intrusion into the Soviet Union, saying that it was "taking full advantage of the mistake made by the United States with the U-2 aircraft."

The "Hindustan Standard" attacked the Soviet Union in a different way on June 2nd. It distorted the Soviet Union's vigilance against the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism as "a fear of the United States," saying that this "fear" "may be as bad as the aggression conspiracy." At the same time, it covered up the United States' creation of tension and strengthening of war preparations, saying that the United States' order for its troops around the world to be on alert was also due to "the same fear factor." It also said that Marshal Malinovsky's statement in the order that aggressive aircraft might carry hydrogen bombs "may not be entirely justified."

The "Times of India," which has stated more than once that the United States would not undermine the Four-Power Summit, again offered advice to the United States on June 2nd, expressing regret over US Vice President Nixon's speech at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting in Washington, saying that Nixon spoke "too bluntly." Nixon openly stated at the meeting that he was no longer interested in summits of Eastern and Western heads of government that were difficult to use to realize his aggressive conspiracies. This newspaper once again supported the US government here, believing that Nixon's views did not necessarily reflect the policy of the US government, and that it "may be another ill-considered statement, made rashly and casually without fully understanding the meaning of the statement." The newspaper also tried its best to dress up Eisenhower, saying that it hoped Eisenhower "does not completely agree with his vice president's views."

The "National Herald" also attacked Marshal Malinovsky's order on June 1st, saying that it "added to the threat to peace."

### 印度一些报纸掀起反苏宣传  竟诬蔑马利诺夫斯基元帅的命令“威胁和平”  并竭力为美国的侵略罪行和备战活动打掩护

    印度一些报纸掀起反苏宣传
    竟诬蔑马利诺夫斯基元帅的命令“威胁和平”
    并竭力为美国的侵略罪行和备战活动打掩护
    新华社3日讯　印度一些报纸最近就苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅5月30日向苏联火箭部队总司令发布的命令再次掀起反苏宣传，它们把苏联这一针对战争贩子及其同谋者发出的严正警告诬蔑成是“要发动核战争”，和“威胁和平”。
    据印度新闻报道，印度“政治家报”6月1日污蔑说，马利诺夫斯基元帅“这种粗鲁和不妥协的方式等于威胁要发动核战争。这是自从美国人公开鼓吹在印度支那使用原子弹的主张以来，最危险的边缘政策的做法。”
    这家报纸还诋毁世界舆论对美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联的罪行的严正谴责，说这是“充分利用美国在Ｕ—2飞机上所犯的错误”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”6月2日用另一种花样攻击苏联。它把苏联对美帝国主义侵略阴谋的警惕歪曲成是“恐惧美国的心理”，说这种“恐惧”“可能和侵略阴谋一样坏”。同时，它又为美国制造紧张局势、加强备战活动打掩护，说美国命令它在世界各地的部队戒备，也是出于“同样的恐惧因素”。它还说什么马利诺夫斯基元帅在命令中关于侵略飞机可能带有氢弹的说法，“可能不完全有道理。”
    曾经不只一次地表示美国不会破坏四国首脑会议的“印度时报”，6月2日又为美国出主意，对美国副总统尼克松在华盛顿举行的东南亚条约组织理事会上的发言表示惋惜，说尼克松说得“太露骨”了。尼克松在会上公然表示对于难以用来实现其侵略阴谋的东西方政府首脑会议已不感兴趣。这家报纸在这里又给美国政府捧场，认为尼克松的观点并不一定反映美国政府的政策，“可能又是一个未加考虑的声明，没有充分了解声明的含义而轻率和随便地发表的”。这家报纸还竭力为艾森豪威尔打扮，说它但愿艾森豪威尔“并不完全同意他的副总统的观点”。
    “国民先驱报”6月1日也攻击马利诺夫斯基元帅的命令“增加了对和平的威胁”。
