    Guangxi Dams Rivers to Fight Drought and Rush Transplanting of Mid-Season Rice
    Anhui Mobilizes Two Million Workers, Soldiers, and Students to Support Summer Harvesting and Planting

    This newspaper reports Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's four-level secretaries are heading to the drought-fighting front line, and five-level cadres are joining forces in the fields, igniting a region-wide mass movement to fight and prevent drought in order to ensure a bumper harvest of early and late-season grains.

    Since the beginning of spring, Guangxi has experienced consistently low rainfall. Most counties in the Baise and Nanning regions have not had significant rainfall for a long time, leading to an unprecedentedly severe drought. Other areas have also experienced varying degrees of drought. Since June, rainfall has decreased even further across the autonomous region, and the drought situation has worsened. It is currently the crucial period for rushing the transplanting of mid-season rice, ensuring the grain filling stage of early rice, and sowing and cultivating seedlings for late rice. Therefore, the drought poses a significant threat to grain crops.

    Under the leadership of the autonomous region's Party committee and the People's Committee, Party committees at all levels and people of all ethnic groups are treating drought fighting and prevention as the current overriding central task in rural areas, concentrating manpower and resources to fight the drought. In Nanning region, more than 8,000 Party secretaries and cadres at all levels in ten counties, including Mashan, have gone to the front line of the drought struggle. In Baise region, which has been persisting in the drought struggle for several months, more than 20,000 secretaries and cadres of the regional, county, commune, and brigade Party committees have gone to the front line. They are conducting a major inspection of drought-fighting and rush transplanting, and working with more than 400,000 people to dam rivers, repair reservoirs and ponds, and use water wheels to irrigate fields, doing everything possible to fight the drought and rush transplanting of mid-season rice, greatly enhancing the confidence and determination of the masses to fight the drought. The masses say, "Fight the drought until the sky bows its head, and never stop until we achieve a bumper harvest." Because the four-level secretaries have gone deep into the drought-fighting front line, they have dispelled the masses' idea of waiting for rain from the sky, and a high tide of drought-fighting and rush transplanting has quickly formed across the region. Currently, more than 214,000 mu of mid-season rice have been transplanted.

    In the fight against drought, all water conservancy projects have been brought into full play, and natural water sources have been fully utilized to expand water sources and increase irrigation capacity. The Baidong River Reservoir, which spans Tianyang and Tiandong counties, has been expanded by the joint efforts of the people of the two counties, opening 55 water diversion canals with a total length of about 30 kilometers, and installing many water measuring weirs and water gauges on the branch canals to release water according to the required water volume, increasing the drought resistance capacity from 43,000 mu to 60,000 mu. Eight counties in the Yulin region have collectively intercepted 1,876 medium and small rivers, opened 2,863 water canals, and excavated 2,864 underground water sources, allowing half of the drought-stricken early rice in the region to be irrigated once or twice, and preparing water for late rice seedling cultivation and transplanting.

    In these days of fighting the heavens for grain, all cities and villages, and communes and communes across the autonomous region have launched a great communist collaboration. Workers in mechanical manufacturing factories and county and commune industries across the autonomous region are making great technical innovations to rush the production of irrigation and drainage equipment and water lifting tools. Now, large numbers of water pumps have been transported to rural areas for drought-fighting. People's communes are also exchanging resources and supporting each other. In order not to miss the mid-season rice transplanting season, Tiandeng County launched a county-wide drought-fighting collaboration. Fifty-one brigades with relatively mild drought conditions mobilized more than 2,500 laborers and more than 700 head of cattle to support brigades severely affected by drought to protect seedlings and rush transplanting of mid-season rice, greatly speeding up the transplanting speed.

    This newspaper reports that during the summer harvest and planting season, nearly two million people from cities and towns and all walks of life in Anhui Province have gone to the countryside to support agricultural production.

    After the Anhui Provincial Party Committee issued a call at the city's five-level cadre meeting for cities to support the countryside and all industries to support agriculture, the vast number of cadres, workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, students, and other urban residents scrambled to go to the countryside to support agricultural production. Over the past month, those who have gone to the countryside have achieved remarkable results in production. In the Lu'an region alone, personnel sent to the countryside have helped communes harvest more than 500,000 mu of wheat, harvest 32,000 mu of rapeseed, and accumulate more than 74 million dan of fertilizer. Summer harvesting and planting were completed on schedule.

    Various departments also support agriculture in all aspects based on their own expertise. The industrial and transportation departments of Fuyang region organized 152 technical teams to go to the countryside to inspect and repair agricultural machinery, repairing 771 irrigation and drainage machines, 109 tractor-times, and repairing and manufacturing more than 290,000 various large and small farm tools. Medical personnel put forward the slogan of "holding a sickle and carrying a medicine bag, producing while treating." Wuhu City organized four mobile medical teams with 56 members to go to the countryside to serve commune members. Commercial workers deliver goods and labor, serving commune members and production. The Xiao County commercial department organized 51,800 people to deliver summer harvest tools and daily necessities to their doorsteps. Before the start of the summer harvest, 430,000 summer harvest tools had been delivered, accounting for more than 90% of the summer harvest needs, and daily necessities worth more than 55,000 yuan were delivered.

    In addition to going to the countryside to support agricultural production during the busy farming season, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, organs, factories, and schools above the county level in various places also adopted the method of assigning areas of responsibility and factory-commune pairing to establish cooperative relations with people's communes and conduct regular support. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,300 factories, more than 2,000 organs, and more than 1,300 secondary schools and above in the province have established regular contact systems with more than 700 people's communes. More than 90% of the people's communes in the province are linked to factories, organs, or schools. Various factories, organs, and schools actively support the communes they are paired with in terms of manpower and material resources. According to extremely incomplete statistics, various places have helped communes establish more than 1,800 farm tool repair factories, local fertilizer plants, and grain processing plants. Relevant departments in Wuhu City have helped communes establish 626 nurseries and kindergartens, 87 commodity purchasing and sales stations, and 5 amateur cultural troupes, and have also adopted the method of sending out and inviting in to train more than 10,000 various technical personnel for the communes.

    广西封江堵河抗旱抢插中稻
    安徽二百万工人士兵学生支援夏收夏种
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区四级书记开赴抗旱第一线，五级干部会师田间，一个保上造、夺晚造粮食丰收的全民抗旱防旱运动席卷全区。
    入春以来，广西雨水一直偏少。百色、南宁两专区大部分县长期没有下过透雨，出现了空前严重的旱象。其他地区也发生了程度不同的干旱。6月份以来，全自治区雨量更少，旱情有了新发展。目前正是抢插中稻、早稻包胎圆粒、晚稻播种育秧的关键时期，因此，干旱对粮食作物危害甚大。
    各级党委和各族人民在自治区党委和区人委的领导下，把抗旱防旱作为当前农村压倒一切的中心任务，集中人力物力奋起抗旱。南宁专区马山等十个县有八千多名各级党委书记和干部深入抗旱斗争前线。几个月来一直坚持抗旱斗争的百色专区，地委、县委、公社、大队党委书记和各级干部两万多人已开赴抗旱第一线，他们一面进行抗旱抢插大检查，一面和四十多万群众一道封江堵河、修补库塘、车水灌田，千方百计抗旱抢插中稻，大大增强了群众抗旱信心和决心。群众说：“抗旱抗到天低头，不获丰收誓不休”。由于四级书记深入抗旱前线，解除了群众坐待老天下雨的思想，全专区迅速形成抗旱抢插高潮，目前已插下中稻二十一万四千多亩。
    抗旱中，各地充分发挥一切水利工程的作用，并充分利用天然水扩大水源，增加灌溉能力。横跨田阳、田东两县的百东河水库，在两县人民同心协力下，增开了五十五条长约三十公里的引水渠，又在支渠上安了许多量水堰和水尺，按需水量放水，使抗旱能力由四万三千亩增加到六万亩。玉林专区八个县共拦截中、小河流一千八百七十六处。增开水渠二千八百六十三条，挖掘地下水源二千八百六十四处，使全专区受旱的早稻，有一半灌了一至二次水，并且为晚稻育秧、插秧准备了用水。
    在这与天争粮的日子里，全自治区各城市与农村、公社与公社之间开展了共产主义大协作。自治区各机械制造工厂和县社工业的工人，大闹技术革新赶制排灌设备和提水工具，现在，大批的抽水机已运往农村，用于抗旱斗争。各人民公社之间也互通有无，相互支援。天等县为了不误中稻插秧季节，开展了全县性的抗旱大协作，全县五十一个受旱较轻的大队，抽出了二千五百多个劳动力和七百多头耕牛支援受旱严重的大队抗旱保苗和抗旱抢插中稻，大大加快了插秧速度。
    本报讯　安徽省各城镇和各行各业，在夏收夏种期间，先后有近二百万人到农村支援农业生产。
    中共安徽省委在城市五级干部会议上发出城市支援农村，各业支援农业的号召以后，广大干部、工人、解放军官兵、学生等城市居民争先恐后地要求下乡支援农业生产。一个月来，下乡人员在生产中获得了显著成绩。仅六安专区下乡人员就帮助公社割麦五十多万亩，收油菜三万二千亩，积肥七千四百多万担。按时完成了夏收夏种。
    各部门还根据自己的特长，从各方面支援农业。阜阳专区工业交通部门组织了一百五十二个技工小组，下乡巡回检修农业机械，已修复排灌机械七百七十一台，拖拉机一零九台次，整修制造各种大小农具二十九万多件。医务人员提出：“手拿镰刀、身背药包，一边生产，一边治疗”的口号。芜湖市组织了有五十六人参加的四个巡回医疗队，下乡为公社社员服务。商业工作者一面送货，一面劳动，为社员、为生产服务。萧县商业部门组织了五万一千八百多人，把夏收工具和日用百货送上门。在夏收开始以前已送各种夏收工具四十三万件，占夏收需要量的90％以上，送日用百货价值五万五千多元。
    除了农忙时节下乡支援农业生产外，根据省委的指示，各地县以上机关、工厂和学校还采取划片包干、厂社挂钩的办法，同人民公社建立了协作关系，进行经常的支援。据不完全统计，全省已有两千三百多个工厂、两千多个机关和一千三百多所中等以上学校，同七百多个人民公社建立了经常的联系制度，全省90％以上的人民公社都与工厂、机关或学校挂了钩。各工厂、机关、学校都在人力和物力上积极地支援自己挂钩的公社。据极不完全的统计，各地已帮助公社建立农具修配厂、土化肥厂、粮食加工厂等一千八百多个。芜湖市有关部门帮助公社建立了托儿所、幼儿园六百二十六个，商品购销站八十七个，业余文工团五个，还采取派出去、请进来的办法，为公社培养了各种技术人才一万多名。（附图片）
