Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, June 17th: The Command of the Fujian Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu" this afternoon, June 17th. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu:

Eisenhower is coming to "visit" you. Those who come are not well-intentioned, and those who are well-intentioned do not come. He is the head of U.S. imperialism, and like Dulles in the past, he has never had good intentions towards you. More than a year ago, Dulles went there to put pressure on you, forcing you to submit to the U.S.'s "Two Chinas" scheme and completely turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony. At that time, we fired cannons, and you resisted the Americans, so Dulles was unable to get his way. Although Dulles is dead, the American ambition to annex Taiwan has not died. Eisenhower's policies are Dulles' policies. Eisenhower is our enemy, and also the enemy of all patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu.

The reputation of U.S. imperialism is getting worse and worse. Not long ago, Eisenhower sabotaged the four-government summit conference, which was opposed by people all over the world. The people of many Asian countries have suffered long and deep oppression from the United States, and their resistance to the United States is also the most intense. Eisenhower's trip from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific this time is to maintain the United States' aggressive position in Asia and strengthen its oppression of the people of Asian countries. People know how to "welcome" such a "plague god." This time, wherever Eisenhower announced he would "visit," waves of opposition have been set off. Eisenhower is coming with a stiff upper lip. Don't think that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are so powerful. When the people of South Korea and Turkey rose up, they threw the United States into a panic and overthrew the two loyal U.S. lackeys, Syngman Rhee and Menderes. The United States has stationed heavy troops in Japan, and the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous government is determined to form a military alliance with the United States. But the Japanese people do not agree, and one struggle follows another, turning the world upside down. Eisenhower was declared "persona non grata" by the heroic Japanese people, his "advance party" was given a humiliating reception, and he himself was turned away. The Philippines has been under U.S. control for a long time, and the people there have also risen up to oppose Eisenhower's robber trip. Patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, you certainly cannot allow Eisenhower to swagger around on your heads. Three years ago, you smashed the U.S. "Embassy" in Taipei, which is a glorious record of anti-American patriotic struggle. Being a loyal dog of the United States, following others' lead, will not end well. We know that you are not willing to endure U.S. bullying. The Americans are instigating "Taiwan autonomy" and creating opposition factions there, which has already given you a headache. When things come to a critical juncture, the Americans will not talk about loyalty to their lackeys. Syngman Rhee and Menderes are lessons from the past. Anyone who follows the United States, seeing this situation, cannot help but feel disheartened? All patriotic Chinese should unite and resolutely fight against the U.S. aggressors.

In order to support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's robber trip, in order to support the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu in opposing Eisenhower's robber trip, and in order to express the great Chinese people's contempt and scorn for Eisenhower, we have decided: In accordance with the established practice of firing cannons on odd-numbered days, on June 17, the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in Taiwan, and on June 19, when Eisenhower leaves Taiwan, we will hold an anti-American armed demonstration on the Jinmen front and fire cannons to "welcome and send off" him. The U.S. armed forces have recently been constantly threatening and provoking us. Our decision is entirely to demonstrate against U.S. imperialism. All patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu who are unwilling to submit to U.S. pressure will certainly agree. In order to protect your lives and safety, we hereby give prior notice. During the shelling, you must hide in safe areas and not come out, so as to avoid accidental injury. Your ships should also pay attention these two days and must not approach the shelling area to avoid danger. If anyone does not follow our advice, is willing to act as an accomplice of the tiger, and dares to disrupt the great anti-American armed demonstration, they will be severely punished. Do not say that you were not warned!

                            Command of the Fujian Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
                                      June 17, 1960

    福建前线司令部发表告台澎金马军民同胞书
    我军炮轰金门举行反美武装示威
    支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争
    支持台澎金马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争
    表示伟大中国人民对美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的蔑视鄙视
    新华社福建前线17日电　中国人民解放军福建前线司令部在17日下午发表了“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”。全文如下：台、澎、金、马军民同胞们：
    艾森豪威尔要到你们那里“访问”了。来者不善，善者不来。他是美帝国主义的头子，同过去的杜勒斯一样，向来对你们不怀好意。一年多以前，杜勒斯到你们那里去，对你们施加压力，要你们服从美国制造“两个中国”的计划，把台湾完全沦为美国的殖民地。当时，我们打了炮，你们抵抗了美国人，杜勒斯没有能够如愿以偿。杜勒斯虽然死了，美国并吞台湾的心并没有死。艾森豪威尔的政策，就是杜勒斯的政策。艾森豪威尔是我们的敌人，也是台、澎、金、马一切爱国同胞的敌人。
    美帝国主义的名声越来越臭。不久以前，艾森豪威尔破坏了四国政府首脑会议，遭到全世界人民的反对。亚洲许多国家的人民，受了美国很久很深的压迫，对美国的反抗也最猛烈。艾森豪威尔这次从太平洋东边跑到太平洋西边来，就是为了维持美国在亚洲的侵略阵地，加强它对亚洲各国人民的压迫。对于这么一个“瘟神”，人们是知道应当怎样“欢迎”他的。这次艾森豪威尔宣布要“访问”的地方，到处掀起了反对的浪潮。艾森豪威尔是硬着头皮来的。切不要以为美帝国主义和它的走狗多么厉害。南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民起来一轰，就叫美帝国主义手忙脚乱，就把美国的两个忠实走狗李承晚、曼德列斯赶下了台。美国在日本驻扎了重兵，岸信介卖国政府死心塌地要跟美国订立军事同盟。可是日本人民不答应，一次斗争接着一次斗争，闹得天翻地复。艾森豪威尔被英勇的日本人民宣布为“不受欢迎的人”，他的“先行官”挨了一顿下马威，他自己也吃了闭门羹。菲律宾受美国控制已久，那里的人民也已经起来反对艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行。台、澎、金、马的爱国同胞，你们当然不能容许艾森豪威尔在你们头上耀武扬威。三年前，你们捣毁过台北的美国“大使馆”，这是反美爱国斗争的光荣纪录。当美国的忠实走狗，随人俯仰，是不会有好下场的。我们知道，你们并不甘心忍受美国的欺侮。美国人在你们那里策动“台湾自治”，制造反对派，已经使你们伤透脑筋。事到紧急关头，美国人不会对他的走狗讲什么义气。李承晚、曼德列斯，就是前车之鉴。凡是跟着美国走的人，看了这种情况，能不寒心？一切有爱国心的中国人，都应当团结起来，同美国侵略者坚决斗争。
    为了支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，为了支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，为了表示伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视，我们决定：按照单日打炮的惯例，在6月17日艾森豪威尔到达台湾的前夕和6月19日艾森豪威尔离开台湾的时候，在金门前线举行反美武装示威，打炮“迎送”。美国的武装力量，近来不断向我们威胁和挑衅。我们这个决定，完全是为了向美帝国主义示威。一切不愿意屈服于美国压力的台、澎、金、马爱国同胞，一定都会赞成。为了保护你们的生命安全，特此事先说明。在炮轰期间，你们务必躲在安全地带，不要出来，以免误伤。你们的船只，在这两天也要注意，切勿驶近炮轰地带，以免危险。倘若有人不遵我们劝告，甘心为虎作伥，胆敢扰乱伟大的反美武装示威，必遭严惩，勿谓言之不预！
                            中国人民解放军福建前线司令部
                                      一九六○年六月十七日
