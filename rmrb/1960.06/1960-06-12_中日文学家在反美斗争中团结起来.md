    Chinese and Japanese Writers Unite in the Anti-American Struggle
    By Our Staff Commentator
    The Japanese writers delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma came to our country for a visit from the front lines of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle, and was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and cultural circles. In the past few days, Chinese and Japanese writers have had friendly and extensive contact, overflowing with deep feelings and high fighting spirit in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, stated: "The Chinese people and literary and art workers will always use their whole body and mind to resolutely support the anti-American patriotic and just struggle waged by the Japanese people and progressive figures in the cultural and art circles." Hiroshi Noma, head of the Japanese writers delegation, said, "The Japanese people and the Chinese people must form a united front to oppose the common enemy—U.S. imperialism, and overthrow it in this struggle." This fully expresses the common aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese people and writers of the two countries.
    In the great storm of the Japanese people opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government, and opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the broad masses of Japanese intellectuals were mobilized on an unprecedented scale, threw themselves into the ranks of the people's struggle, and emitted strong light and heat. Professors from almost all universities in Tokyo were involved in the torrent of struggle, shouting "Get out of the ivory tower" and "Even those who are not leftists should speak out loudly." Well-known writers, scholars, artists, and many journalists gathered under the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty Criticism Association," the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty Problem Research Association," various "round table conferences," and other organizations, forming an active and influential cultural front. Recently, more than 2,000 professors and scholars from more than 60 universities and 40 research institutes in Japan held a conference in Tokyo and established the "Association of Scholars and Researchers for the Defense of Democracy," and passed a resolution condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for forcibly passing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Chichiro Tomonaga, President of Tokyo University of Education, and 146 other scholars issued a statement demanding the dissolution of the Diet to save Japan's democratic crisis. Maoji Kayuo, President of the University of Tokyo, Hideki Yukawa, Professor of Kyoto University, and Nobumoto Ohama, President of Waseda University, also expressed their demands for Kishi Nobusuke to step down and immediately dissolve the Diet. The broad masses of Japanese intellectuals not only used their pens, their voices, and their songs to denounce the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and encourage the people's fighting spirit, but also took to the streets, factories, schools, and various struggle venues to participate in various mass struggles together with workers, peasants, students, and people from other strata. In the June 4th general strike of 5.6 million workers, professors, poets, and artists organized picket lines, supported the workers' strike overnight, and participated in demonstrations around the Diet building, the Prime Minister's official residence, and the U.S. Embassy. Now, Japanese intellectuals are continuing their efforts to participate in the 18th National United Action, making their own contributions to winning greater victories for the Japanese people.
    The Japanese people and intellectuals cannot tolerate the suffocating days under the semi-military occupation of U.S. imperialism. The rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries has caused Japan's independence, sovereignty, and dignity to be ravaged, and the people's democratic and free rights to be severely undermined. Under the cultural aggression of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese national culture cannot develop normally. Now, the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty not only makes Japan a new source of war in Asia, embarking on the road of aggressive war against China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, but also strengthens Japan's dependence on the United States. This has made the Japanese people and intellectuals more and more aware, united, and determined to oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke clique, and fight for an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral Japan.
    Greater fighting actions by the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are still to come, and the Japanese people's infinite and tremendous potential will be more fully brought into play. The same is true for Japanese intellectuals. In the victorious struggle of the Japanese people against Kishi Nobusuke's amendment of the "Police Duties Execution Law" in 1958, Japanese intellectuals began to show their strength. Now, they have further united with the broad masses of the people, have been tempered by the unprecedented anti-American patriotic and just struggle, have greatly changed their outlook, and are playing the role of drummers for the people. They are constantly breaking through the trend of worshiping "Western civilization," eliminating the poison of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression, developing a patriotic, people's democratic, and progressive culture, and exerting unprecedentedly powerful combat effectiveness in the surging great struggle. It is impossible for U.S. imperialism to enslave a Japan with a highly developed cultural tradition for a long time. This can only go against its wishes and arouse increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese people and patriotic intellectuals. As long as Japanese intellectuals unite, unite with the people of the whole country, and persist in the struggle to the end, they will surely be able to defeat the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous group, and open up a bright future for Japanese culture.
    The Chinese people and intellectuals, who have defeated the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and are waging a resolute struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, have deep sympathy for the struggle of the Japanese people and patriotic intellectuals against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and will continue to give it their full support. We believe that through this visit of the Japanese writers delegation to our country, the unity of the Chinese and Japanese people and the cooperation of the writers of the two countries will have new developments.
    Let Chinese and Japanese writers unite, let Asian writers unite, blow the battle horn of the East more loudly, and encourage the Asian people to fight against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, to advance, advance, and advance again.

    中日文学家在反美斗争中团结起来
    本报评论员
    以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，从日本人民的爱国正义斗争的前线来到我国访问，受到了我国人民和文化界人士的热烈欢迎。这几天，中日两国作家们进行了友好的广泛接触，洋溢着在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中的深挚感情和昂扬斗志。中国作家协会主席茅盾表示：“中国人民和文学艺术家永远运用整个身心，坚决支持日本人民和文化艺术界进步人士进行的反美爱国正义斗争”。日本文学家代表团团长野间宏说，“日本人民和中国人民要结成统一战线，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义，在这个斗争中把它打倒”。这充分表达了中日两国人民、两国文学家的一致心声。
    在日本人民掀起的反对日美军事同盟条约、反对岸信介政府、反对艾森豪威尔访日的巨大风暴中，日本广大知识界人士空前地动员了起来，投入了人民群众的战斗行列，发出了强烈的光和热。东京几乎全部大学的教授卷进了斗争洪流，高呼“走出象牙之塔”，“不是左派也要大声疾呼。”著名的作家、学者、艺术家和许多新闻界人士，集合在“日美安全条约批判会”、“日美安全条约问题研究会”、各种“恳谈会”和其他组织之下，形成了一条活跃的、有很大影响的文化战线。最近日本六十多个大学和四十个研究所的两千多名教授和学者在东京举行大会又成立了“学者和研究工作者保卫民主协会”的组织并通过决议，谴责岸信介政府用暴力通过新日美“安全条约”。东京教育大学校长朝永振一郎等一百四十六名学者声明，要求解散国会，以挽救日本民主主义危机。东京大学校长茅诚司、京都大学教授汤川秀树、早稻田大学校长大滨信泉也纷纷表示要求岸信介下台，立即解散国会。日本广大知识界人士不仅用自己的笔、用自己的声音，用自己的歌唱，声讨美日反动派，鼓舞人民斗志；而且走上街头、工厂、学校和各种斗争场所，与工人、农民、学生和其他阶层人民一起参加各种群众斗争。在五百六十万工人的六·四总罢工中，教授、诗人和艺术家组织纠察线，通宵支援工人罢工，参加在国会大厅、首相官邸和美国大使馆周围的示威。现在，日本知识界人士正在再接再厉地参加第十八次全国统一行动，为争取日本人民的更大胜利而作出自己的贡献。
    日本人民和知识分子不能忍受美帝国主义半军事占领状态下的窒息的日子。美日反动派的统治，使得日本的独立、主权和尊严横遭蹂躏，人民的民主自由权利备受摧残。在美帝国主义的文化侵略下，日本民族文化也得不到正常的发展。现在，日美军事同盟条约不但更使日本成为亚洲的新的战争策源地，走上同中苏和亚洲人民为敌的侵略战争道路，而且更加强了日本对美国的从属性。这都使得日本人民和知识分子一天天觉悟起来，团结起来，坚决反对新日美“安全条约”，反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介集团的统治，为争取独立、和平、民主、中立的日本而斗争。
    日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的更大战斗行动还在后边，日本人民无穷无尽的巨大潜力将要更充分地发挥出来。对日本知识分子来说，也是如此。1958年日本人民反对岸信介修改“警察官职务执行法”的胜利斗争中，日本知识分子就开始显示了自己的力量。现在，他们进一步地同广大人民群众结合起来，受到空前规模的反美爱国正义斗争的锻炼，大大改变了自己的面貌，起着人民的鼓手作用。他们正在不断冲破崇拜“西洋文明”的风气，排除美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害，发展爱国主义的人民民主的进步文化，在汹涌澎湃的伟大斗争中发挥空前强大的战斗力。美帝国主义要想长期奴役一个具有高度发展的文化传统的日本，是不可能的。这只能走到它的愿望的反面，唤起日本人民和爱国知识分子越来越强烈的反对。只要日本知识分子团结起来，同全国人民团结起来，坚持斗争到底，他们就一定能够战胜美帝国主义和岸信介卖国集团的反动统治，开辟日本文化的灿烂前景。
    已经战胜了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，并正在同帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决斗争的中国人民和知识分子，对于日本人民和爱国知识分子反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，有着深切的同情，并将继续全力予以支持。我们相信，通过这次日本文学家代表团的访问我国，中日两国人民的团结，中日两国文学家的合作，会有新的发展。
    中日文学家团结起来，亚洲文学家团结起来，更响亮地吹起东方的战斗号角，鼓舞亚洲人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争前进，前进，再前进。
