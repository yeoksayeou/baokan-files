Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Seiki Suzuki, special representative and head of the Dispute Countermeasures Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said at the World Federation of Trade Unions' 11th Council Meeting on the morning of the 6th that the Japanese people will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and continue their struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" until the day of victory.

He said that currently, the Japanese people are engaged in a fierce struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abrogation of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi group. In the 17th unified action, on June 4th, we organized a general strike of 5.6 million workers, including 3.6 million workers from 57 industrial unions affiliated with Sohyo, 1 million workers from 19 independent industrial unions, and other workers, giving a serious blow to U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government.

Suzuki pointed out that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the people of Asian countries, and it marks the revival of Japanese militarism.

Suzuki reviewed the contents of the joint statement issued by the trade unions of Japan, China, and Korea on May 1st of this year and expressed support for the just struggle of the South Korean people. He said, "We believe that the heroic struggle of the South Korean people is shaking the imperialist bloc and encouraging the people of the world. This event warns the U.S. imperialist puppet traitorous ruling group, and in Japan, it warns Nobusuke Kishi that he will also follow the same fate as Syngman Rhee."

Suzuki said that Sohyo has expressed its determination to further develop the struggle of the workers of the Mitsui Miike Coal Mine in Japan and to achieve victory in this struggle.

He said that Sohyo requests trade unions in Asian and African countries to launch unified actions in various forms to give strong support to the major struggles of Japanese workers.

In order to support the struggle of the workers of the Mitsui Miike Coal Mine under Sohyo, the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, and the struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination and for national independence, we must cooperate with each other and take joint action.

He said that in order for the working classes of Asian and African countries to unanimously drive U.S. imperialism out of the Western Pacific and thoroughly eliminate the war forces of colonialism in the Asian and African regions, the working classes of Japan, China, and Korea have clearly expressed their determination to further strengthen unity in their joint statement. We call on trade unions in Asian and African countries here: Continue to advance to defend Asian and African and world peace.

Suzuki said, "We are convinced that the struggle of the 'National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty' and the more than 2,000 regional joint struggle organizations across the country in Japan is supported by the working class of the whole world, which is unprecedented in the history of the world workers' movement."

He said that the struggle of Japanese workers is always difficult and not a short-term struggle. After the general strike on June 4th, the struggle will continue until the day of victory.

He said that our struggle has not only received the support of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, but also the support of the workers of Indonesia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Hungary, Congo, and Zanzibar. We are convinced that our struggle will develop from the common struggle of more than 70 million workers in Japan, China, and Korea into the common struggle of 100 to 200 million workers around the world.

Sohyo hopes that this Council meeting will support this trend and make a decision requiring member organizations to make resolutions or take joint actions separately.

He said that the large-scale rallies held by more than 20 million people in various parts of China against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty have given us incredibly powerful strength.

Suzuki said that as our struggle has been further strengthened today, I am afraid that Eisenhower will not be able to visit Japan according to the established plan. Today, Eisenhower has become a person unwelcome by the people of any country; especially now that their thoughts have been more clearly exposed due to that disgraceful U-2 aircraft incident, he is even more unwelcome by the people.

He said that Sohyo has pointed out that the reason for the failure of the summit conference lies entirely with Eisenhower, and it was Eisenhower who planned to sabotage it.

The U-2 aircraft is called the "black jet" in Japan. The struggle of the people near the base of this aircraft against the base is completely combined with the struggle against the security treaty.

Black jets are not only in Japan, but also in many parts of Western Europe. We believe that Marshal Malinovsky's statement not only does not mean war, but for the workers, his statement is a struggle to abolish military bases.

Suzuki said that the struggle of Japanese workers under the rule of U.S. imperialism cannot but be combined with the struggle of workers in Western European countries who are in exactly the same conditions as Japan.

Especially Japan and Germany, which became the starting points of World War II, we believe that under the present conditions, the two countries are also completely consistent and can jointly organize the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the abolition of military bases.

He said that the struggle to abolish all military treaties for the purpose of eliminating armaments worldwide is an important struggle for workers.

    日总评代表铃木诚市在世界工联理事会议上说
    日本人民得到全世界支持  将坚持斗争直到取得胜利
    新华社6日讯　特邀代表、日本工会总评议会争议对策部长铃木诚市，6日上午在世界工联第十一次理事会会议上讲话时说，日本人民必将排除一切困难和障碍，继续进行反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争，直到胜利那天。
    他说，现在，日本人民为了阻止修改和争取废除美帝国主义与岸信介集团签订的新日美“安全条约”，正在进行着激烈的斗争。在第十七次统一行动中，6月4日，我们组织了有总评所属的五十七个产业工会三百六十万工人十九个独立的产业工会一百万工人及其他工人共达五百六十万工人参加的总罢工，给美帝国主义和岸信介政府以严重的打击。
    铃木诚市指出日美“安全条约”是敌视中国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及亚洲各国人民的侵略性的军事同盟，是标志着日本军国主义复活的。
    铃木诚市回顾了日本、中国、朝鲜三国工会在今年5月1日发表的联合声明的内容，表示支持南朝鲜人民的正义斗争。他说，我们认为，南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，是使帝国主义集团发抖，是鼓励全世界人民的重大事件。这个事件警告了美帝国主义的傀儡卖国统治集团，在日本来说，警告了岸信介，他也将走上与李承晚同样的命运。
    铃木诚市说，总评已表明决心要进一步发展日本三井三池煤矿工人的斗争，并使这一斗争获得胜利。
    他说，总评要求亚非各国工会以各种形式展开统一行动，给日本工人重大的斗争以强有力的支持。
    为了总评属下的炭劳三池煤矿工人的斗争、南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争、南非人民反对种族歧视和争取民族独立的斗争，互相合作，采取联合行动。
    他说，为了亚非各国工人一致把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去，并在亚非地区彻底肃清殖民主义的战争势力，日、中、朝三国工人阶级已经在它们的联合声明中明确表示进一步加强团结的决心。我们在这里呼吁亚非各国工会：为保卫亚非和世界和平继续前进。
    铃木诚市说，我们确信：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”和全国两千多个地区联合斗争组织所进行的斗争，受到全世界工人阶级的支持，这是世界工人运动的历史上所没有过的。
    他说，日本工人的斗争总是有困难的，而且不是短期的斗争。在6月4日总罢工之后，必将继续进行斗争，直到胜利那天。
    他说，我们的斗争不仅已经得到中华全国总工会和朝鲜职业总同盟的支持，而还得到了印度尼西亚、蒙古、越南、匈牙利、刚果、桑给巴尔的工人的支持。我们确信，我们的斗争将从日本、中国、朝鲜三国七千万以上工人的共同斗争，发展成为全世界一亿两亿工人的共同斗争。
    总评希望这次理事会会议支持上述这种趋势，并作出要求所属会员团体分别作出决议或采取联合行动的方针的决定。
    他说，中国各地两千多万人为反对日美军事同盟条约已经举行过的大规模集会，给我们增加了无比强大的力量。
    铃木诚市说，在我们的斗争进一步加强了的今天，恐怕艾森豪威尔不能按既定计划访问日本了。今天，艾森豪威尔已经成为不受任何国家的人民欢迎的人了；特别是由于那个可耻的U—2型飞机事件，他们的想法暴露得更加清楚了的现在，他就更加不受人民欢迎了。
    他说，总评曾经指出：首脑会议失败的原因完全在于艾森豪威尔方面，是艾森豪威尔有计划地破坏的。
    U—2型飞机，在日本被称为“黑色的喷气飞机”。这种飞机的基地附近的人民反对基地的斗争，是完全与反对安全条约的斗争结合着进行的。
    黑色的喷气飞机，不仅在日本，而且在西欧也有不少。我们认为马利诺夫斯基元帅的声明，不仅不意味着战争，而且对于工人来说，他的声明就是取消军事基地的斗争。
    铃木诚市说，在美帝国主义统治下的日本工人的斗争，是不能不同与日本处在完全一样条件下的西欧各国工人的斗争结合起来。
    特别是成为第二次世界大战爆发点的日本和德国，我们认为在现在的条件下，两国也是完全一致的，能够共同组织反对美帝国主义、取消军事基地的斗争。
    他说，为了在世界范围内取消军备而进行的取消所有的军事条约的斗争，对工人来说是重要的斗争。
