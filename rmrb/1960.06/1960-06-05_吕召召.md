Lü Zhaozhao
Zhang Zhimin

I.
In the warm spring, March, a hundred flowers bloom,
I see colorful arches erected in the alley.
Whose sister-in-law is that! Climbing so high?
The sisters call her, "Lü Zhaozhao."

A red coat as red as the sky,
She embraces that embroidered plaque with both hands.
A large "Happiness" character flashes with golden light,
Pressed tightly against her heart.

Singing "The People's Commune is good,"
Her song accompanies her heart's beating.
Leaving the stove and stepping out of the house,
Her eyes filled with tears, unable to speak.

Mother Yu! Don't complain about your daughter-in-law eating and dressing!
Anything your son can do, she can do.
Father Yu! Don't say Zhaozhao has no ability,
She stands tall and proud!

The Party's strength is in her heart,
She holds up an era and walks with her chest out...

II.
The motors and lathes sing,
Lü Zhaozhao stands beside the machine.
Golden threads flash as the silver shuttles pass,
Weaving back and forth is the song in her heart.

That time she returned to her mother's home in the countryside,
It happened to be when the rural communes were forming.
Her father felt content, her mother pleased,
Her sister-in-law was filled with joy.

Someone cooks meals, someone looks after the children,
Two mountains have been lifted from her sister-in-law's shoulders.
Jumping off the bed and leaving the millstone behind,
A thousand-pound lock has been removed from her sister-in-law.

Her sister-in-law's face blooms like a peach blossom,
A bright pearl unearthed.
She carries saplings up the mountain slopes,
She carries an iron spade to dig fishponds.

Her sister-in-law's name is on the honor roll,
Who would dare to look down on women again?
She looks at her sister-in-law, full of light,
She sees her sister-in-law's heart is bright.

Looking at her sister-in-law, she thinks of herself,
When will the commune come to the city?
Day and night she thinks and dreams,
When will we welcome the commune into the city?

III.
The north wind howls, snowflakes flutter,
Lü Zhaozhao walks in the alley.
Holding Yu Yu in her arms, leading Ping by the hand,
Followed by Da Ying and Er Ying.

Going to the east house and entering the west house,
She talks with the sisters.
"Everyone should be involved in building socialism,
Why are we sisters just sitting and waiting?

"The Party has shown us the path to liberation,
If we want to turn ourselves around, we must rely on ourselves..."
Thousands of strands of silk, tens of thousands of threads,
The sisters' concerns are linked like roots.

A piece of good news passed from ten thousand mouths,
A red flag held up by ten thousand hands.
The courtyard is brightly lit,
Sisters gather together.

Chairman Mao's portrait hangs before their eyes,
He adds great ambitions to people's hearts.
Listen to the Party and follow the Party,
Secretary Li clasps Zhaozhao's hand tightly.

Who says women can't run a household?
Zhaozhao says, "Organized, we can manage the world!"
"We must send away the old history of thousands of years,
We must build a new city with our own hands!"

Plant the tree of happiness with our own hands,
Build the communist mansion with our own hands...

Run nurseries and cafeterias,
Lü Zhaozhao takes the lead in running factories.
The alleys of thousands of years are changed in a day,
Every brick and tile shines.

Clean water sprinkled on the streets, flowers paving the road,
Zhaozhao welcomes the commune!

IV.
Zhaozhao breaks out of those four walls,
Like a fish in a pond entering the river.
Looking at the blue sky, her heart is wide,
Taking a breath of spring breeze, her belly feels warm.

She's used to scissors and knives,
Zhaozhao is naturally skilled.
Visiting here, learning there,
She's recognized dozens of master craftsmen.

Who says "It's hard to learn a craft after thirty"?
She's thirty-five, but doesn't feel it's too late to apprentice.
Who says "It's rare for one person to be proficient in two trades"?
Zhaozhao has become a "jack-of-all-trades."

She can operate a loom to weave brocade,
Pick up a silver needle to embroider peonies.
She can carry, lift, and unload cargo,
She can ride a tricycle to deliver goods.

That day she organized the sisters,
And started creating new machines.
She flicks her hair and wipes away sweat:
"Hey! It turns out it's not an iron gate!"

No matter how great the difficulties, she is not afraid,
No difficulty is greater than her ambition.
Everyone knows Lü Zhaozhao,
Wherever there is something to do, she is there.

In the morning she helps the cafeteria make sweet sauce,
In the afternoon she repairs doors and windows for the nursery.
Adding an evening shift and getting up early,
She steams rice cakes for the home for the elderly.

Zhaozhao is like a flame,
Wherever she goes, it's warm.
Zhaozhao is like a tree of flowers,
Admired and praised by thousands.

If you meet Zhaozhao,
I guarantee your heart will be wide open for three days.

V.
Holiday break, Sunday,
The whole family goes boating.
The husband holds Yu Yu, the mother-in-law carries Ping,
Zhaozhao leads the two Yings by the hand.

The spring breeze blows the small boat,
A boat of songs, a boat of laughter.
The mother-in-law praises her daughter-in-law's abilities,
Ping says, "Mom is the factory's 'all-around red'."

Still, Ying Ying knows more,
She knows that her mother has joined the Party.
Yu Yu's father looks at her with happy eyes,
Making her face burn with embarrassment.

Taking Yu Yu and kissing her face,
What is it that flies into her heart?
A red star shines before her eyes,
She sees the small factory in the alley.

Looking forward along that red light,
Zhaozhao sees a thousand miles ahead.
From now on, don't say this factory is small,
Paradise on earth is being built here.

From now on, don't say this alley is narrow,
This alley's road is as wide as the sea.
Ten thousand rays of golden light, the rising sun,
The whole family sees that road.

Chairman Mao has opened the road for us,
Illuminating our descendants for generations to come.
Looking at today, thinking about tomorrow,
Her heart is hot, and she can't stop her eyes from getting sore.

Holding her son and pulling her daughter closer,
Which of the words in her stomach should she say first?
"Yu Yu, Ying Ying..." she calls sweetly,
Smiling in her heart for their happiness...

    吕召召
    张志民
    一
    阳春三月百花开，
    望见胡同儿里扎彩牌。
    哪家大嫂啊！爬得哪么高？
    姐妹们唤她：“吕召召”。
    一件子红袄红满天，
    她双手搂定那绣金匾。
    斗大的“喜”字闪金光，
    紧紧贴在她心窝儿上。
    口里唱着“人民公社好”，
    歌声伴着她心儿跳。
    离开了锅灶走出了家，
    满眶眶热泪说不出话。
    玉他奶！再别嫌媳妇情吃穿！
    你儿能干的她都能干。
    玉他爹！再别说召召没能耐，
    她顶天立地站起来！
    党给的力量装心头，
    她举着个时代挺胸走……
    二
    马达??车床唱，
    吕召召站在机床旁。
    金线线闪闪银梭儿过，
    穿来穿去是她心上的歌。
    那遭儿回乡住娘家，
    正赶上农村公社化。
    老爹顺心娘如意，
    嫂嫂更是一个字儿的喜。
    饭有人做来娃娃有人看，
    嫂身上卸下了两座座山。
    跳出了炕头丢开了磨，
    嫂身上摘下了千斤的锁。
    嫂嫂的脸如桃花儿开，
    一颗明珠出土来。
    背起树苗她上山岗，
    扛上铁锨她挖鱼塘。
    嫂嫂的名字红榜挂，
    谁再敢低看女人家。
    她望着嫂嫂满身光，
    她望见嫂嫂心里头亮。
    眼望着嫂嫂想自己，
    哪一天公社能到城里？
    日里想呀夜里梦，
    哪一天把公社迎进城？
    三
    北风嘶嘶雪花儿飘，
    胡同儿里走着吕召召。
    怀抱着玉玉手领着平，
    后跟着大英和二英。
    东家子出来西家子进，
    她同那姐妹们去谈心。
    “搞社会主义人人动，
    咱姐妹为啥就坐着等？
    “党为咱指明了解放路，
    想翻身还要咱自作主……”
    千条条丝呀万根根线，
    姐妹们的心事一条根根连。
    一声喜讯万人递，
    一杆红旗万人举。
    四合子大院明灯亮，
    姐姐妹妹聚一堂。
    毛主席像片挂眼前，
    他给人心把大志添。
    听党的话来跟着党走，
    李书记紧握着召召的手。
    谁说女人当不了家？
    召召说：“组织起来管天下！”
    “要送走那千年旧历史，
    要手开人间新城市！”
    幸福大树亲手儿栽，
    共产主义大厦亲手儿盖……
    办起托儿所办食堂，
    吕召召带头去办工厂。
    千年的胡同儿一日里改，
    每块块砖瓦都亮起来。
    净水泼街花铺道，
    召召把公社迎来了！
    四
    召召冲出那四堵墙，
    像池里的鱼儿进了江。
    望望那青天心里宽，
    吸一口春风肚里暖。
    她使惯了剪子拿惯了刀，
    召召生来手头儿巧。
    这里参观那里学，
    老师傅认下了几十个。
    谁说“人过三十学艺难”？
    她三十五学徒不觉晚。
    谁说“一人难得两行精”？
    召召就学成了个“百事通”。
    开动车床织锦缎，
    拿起银针绣牡丹。
    能担能扛能卸车，
    蹬起三轮她会送货。
    那日把姐妹们组织起，
    动手创造新机器。
    她撩撩头发抹把儿汗：
    “咳！原来并不是铁打的关！”
    再大的困难她不怕，
    啥困难也没她志气大。
    人人都知道吕召召，
    哪处儿有事她哪处儿到。
    前晌帮食堂做甜酱，
    后晌给托儿所修门窗。
    加个晚班起个早，
    给敬老院里蒸锅糕。
    召召好似一团火，
    她到哪儿哪儿热。
    召召好比一树花，
    千人羡慕万人夸。
    你若和召召见上一面，
    保准你心里要宽三天。
    五
    假日工休星期天，
    全家老小去划船。
    丈夫抱着玉玉婆婆带着平，
    召召手领着两英英。
    春风吹动小船摇，
    一船歌声一船笑。
    婆夸着媳妇样样能，
    平说：“妈是厂里的‘满堂红’”。
    还是英英知事儿广，
    她知道妈妈入了党。
    玉儿爹喜眼向她瞧，
    瞧得她脸上怪发烧。
    接过玉儿亲亲脸，
    是啥事儿飞上了她心间？
    一颗红星眼前亮，
    她望见那胡同里小工厂。
    顺着那红光往前看，
    召召望出有千里远。
    从今莫说这厂房小，
    人间天堂就在这儿造。
    从今莫道这胡同儿窄，
    这胡同的道路宽似海。
    金光万道旭日出，
    全家人望见了那条路。
    毛主席给咱把路开，
    照亮子孙万万代。
    看看今天想明天，
    心热止不住那眼圈儿酸。
    抱着儿子又拉过女，
    满肚话可先说哪一句？
    “玉儿、英儿……”甜口儿叫，
    心儿里为他们的幸福笑……
