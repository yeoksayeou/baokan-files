    Advance Along the Bloodstained Path of the Martyrs!
    The "June 15th" massacre perpetrated by the Nobusuke Kishi group has aroused indignation among the people of Japan. Millions of people mourn the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the independence and freedom of Japan, and angrily protest the Nobusuke Kishi group's heinous and bloody crimes. Turning grief into strength, the Japanese people have launched an even more powerful protest demonstration movement. The Diet, the Kishi Nobusuke residence, and the surrounding areas of the Metropolitan Police Department were filled with deafening roars from the masses: demanding punishment for the murderers, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and opposing the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty! People all over the country rose up in response, flocking to the ranks of the demonstrations. The flames of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle have burned even more fiercely as they have been splashed with the blood of the martyrs. Faced with the people's unstoppable tide of protest, the Kishi Nobusuke government was forced to announce an indefinite postponement of Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan. This is a preliminary victory for the Japanese people in their struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government, against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan! The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Japanese people on their victory! We pay our highest respects to the Japanese students who are standing at the forefront of the struggle and to the heroic Japanese people who are persisting in the struggle! We express our deep condolences to the deceased martyrs and their families! We extend our cordial regards to the wounded students and people from all walks of life!
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's announcement of an indefinite postponement of Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan is the result of the Japanese people's unyielding persistence in their struggle. For more than a year, the Japanese people have waged a sustained and tenacious struggle, rising wave upon wave, in order to thwart the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war through the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. After the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly "passed" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives, the Japanese people's struggle against this treaty has risen even higher. The Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty are both in a precarious situation. Therefore, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries attempted to use Eisenhower's visit to Japan as a trick to intimidate the Japanese people, but, contrary to their wishes, Eisenhower's insistence on visiting Japan aroused even greater anger among the Japanese people. They resolutely launched a struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and linked it with the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In order to pave the way for Eisenhower, the Kishi Nobusuke group created the "June 15th" tragedy, which not only failed to suppress the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, but, on the contrary, as the American propaganda machine said, "added fuel to the fire." Under such circumstances, the Kishi Nobusuke group had no choice but to announce its request that Eisenhower postpone his visit to Japan, temporarily cooling down the Japanese people's struggle mood, in order to avoid the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the Kishi Nobusuke group itself being burned down by the people's unstoppable anger. The forced change of Eisenhower's visit plan cannot but be a major failure for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. It makes Eisenhower, who is already en route, unable to conceal the isolated position he and the U.S. imperialism he represents are in, no matter what kind of excuses he uses.
    It is quite obvious that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will never willingly abandon the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and will continue to use all kinds of vicious and barbaric means to impose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on the Japanese people. In order to achieve this goal, the extremely vicious U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group will not stop their bloody suppression of the people. The Kishi Nobusuke government's statement requesting Eisenhower to postpone his visit clearly stated that it would not resign en masse or dissolve the Diet until the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty naturally came into effect or completed the "ratification" procedures; and that it was prepared to "resolutely strike" against the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle and "fight on all fronts" against the Japanese people. The Associated Press also openly instructed the Kishi Nobusuke government to "take more drastic measures" against the Japanese people who are fighting heroically. The "New York Times" even openly slandered the Japanese people as "villains" and ordered that "the Japanese government has the responsibility to stop" the Japanese people's struggle. It also used with ulterior motives the clauses in the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" regarding the U.S. military's ability to help the Japanese reactionary authorities suppress the Japanese people's patriotic struggle, shamelessly threatening the Japanese people by saying: "American kindness should not be mistaken for weakness." These murderous cries indicate that the "June 15th" bloody tragedy could be repeated at any time. The long-tempered Japanese people will be highly vigilant against Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy of bloody suppression.
    Despite this, the Kishi Nobusuke government's forced announcement of the postponement of Eisenhower's visit convincingly shows that no matter how stubborn and rampant imperialism and reactionaries are, as long as the people unite and carry out a resolute struggle, they can defeat all their conspiracies. As everyone knows, brutal imperialism and all reactionaries will never automatically lay down their weapons before they die. They will slaughter unarmed people at any time,妄想 (wàngxiǎng) attempting to force the people to submit through bloody suppression. They can only retreat in the face of a powerful people's struggle. The struggle and victory of the South Korean people have proven this truth, and the struggle and victory of the Japanese people have also proven this truth. Therefore, this preliminary victory achieved by the Japanese people cannot but further encourage their anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle, inspiring them to continue their efforts, advance along the bloodstained path of the martyrs, and completely crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and overthrow the reactionary rule of the U.S. running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke group.
    The blood of the Japanese people has not been shed in vain. Every struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is part of the common struggle of the people of Asian countries against U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war, and to defend peace in Asia and the world; every victory achieved by the Japanese people is also a victory for the people of Asian countries, making a great contribution to the cause of peace for the people of Asia, and greatly encouraging other Asian people who are currently engaged in opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression. The people of Asian countries will continue to resolutely support the Japanese people's anti-American, anti-Kishi struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom until the Japanese people completely achieve their goals. We firmly believe that the final victory must belong to the heroic Japanese people who are indomitable and carry the struggle through to the end!

    踏着烈士们的血迹前进！
    岸信介集团制造的“六·一五”大屠杀，激起了日本举国人民的悲愤。千千万万人们沉痛地哀悼为日本的独立和自由而牺牲的烈士，愤怒地抗议岸信介集团令人发指的血腥罪行。把悲痛化为力量，日本人民已经展开了更加强大的抗议示威运动。日本国会、岸信介官邸和警视厅周围响彻着群众震天的吼声：要求惩办杀人凶手，要求岸信介政府下台，要求解散国会，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，反对批准日美军事同盟条约！全国各地的人民奋起响应，纷纷涌进了示威行列。日本人民反美反岸的斗争火焰由于洒上了烈士的鲜血而燃烧得更加炽烈了。面对着人民不可遏止的抗议怒潮，岸信介政府被迫宣布无限期推迟艾森豪威尔访日的计划。这是日本人民反对岸信介卖国政府，反对日美军事同盟条约和反对艾森豪威尔访日斗争的一个初步胜利！中国人民衷心祝贺日本人民的胜利！向站在斗争最前线的日本学生和坚持斗争的英勇的日本人民致以崇高的敬意！向死难的烈士和他们的家属表示沉痛的哀悼！向负伤的学生和各界人士致以亲切的慰问！
    岸信介政府宣布无限期推迟艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划，是日本人民不屈不挠地坚持斗争的结果。一年多来，日本人民为了粉碎美日反动派通过日美军事同盟条约策划新战争的阴谋，进行了持续顽强的斗争，一浪高似一浪。在岸信介集团强使众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约之后，日本人民反对这个条约的斗争是更加高涨了。岸信介政府和日美军事同盟条约都处于风雨飘摇之中。因此，美日反动派便企图安排艾森豪威尔访问日本这一招，来对日本人民进行恐吓，但是，事与愿违，艾森豪威尔的坚持访日，激起了日本人民更大的愤怒。他们坚决展开反对艾森豪威尔访日的斗争，而且把它同反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争联结起来。为了给艾森豪威尔开路，岸信介集团制造了“六·一五”大惨案，结果是不但没有能把日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争镇压下去，相反的，正如美国宣传机器所说的是“火上加油”。在这样的形势之下，岸信介集团才不得不宣布要求艾森豪威尔推迟他访问日本的计划，暂时冷却一下日本人民的斗争情绪，以图避免日美军事同盟条约和岸信介集团自己也会一下子被人民势不可当的怒火烧掉。艾森豪威尔访日计划的被迫改变，对美日反动派来说，不能不是一个大失败，它使得已在途中的艾森豪威尔，无论再用什么样的辩解，都无法掩饰他和他所代表的美帝国主义，已经处在多么孤立的地位。
    十分明显，美日反动派绝不会甘心舍弃日美军事同盟条约的，必将继续用尽一切毒辣和蛮横的手段，把日美军事同盟条约强加到日本人民头上。为了达到这个目的，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义和岸信介集团也不会停止对人民的血腥镇压。岸信介政府要求艾森豪威尔延期访日的声明就明白表示，它在日美军事同盟条约自然成立或完成“批准”手续以前，不实行全体辞职，也不解散国会；并准备对日本人民的爱国正义斗争“断然加以打击”，同日本人民“在一切方面进行斗争”。美联社也公开指使岸信介政府应对英勇斗争的日本人民“采取更加激烈的措施”。“纽约时报”甚至公然诬蔑日本人民为“恶棍”，责令“日本政府有责任制止”日本人民的斗争。它并且别有用心地引用日美“安全条约”中关于美军得以帮助日本反动当局镇压日本人民爱国斗争的条款，无耻恫吓日本人民说：“不应该把美国的仁慈错认为柔弱”。这些杀气腾腾的叫嚣，表明了“六·一五”流血惨案，随时都有可能重演。久经锻炼的日本人民对于岸信介这种血腥镇压的阴谋，是会引起高度警惕的。
    尽管如此，岸信介政府被迫宣布推迟艾森豪威尔的访问，令人信服地表明：不论帝国主义和反动派如何顽固和猖狂，只要人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争，就能够击败它们的一切阴谋计划。众所周知，残暴的帝国主义和一切反动派，在死亡之前是决不会自动放下武器的，它们随时都会对手无寸铁的人民进行屠杀，妄想用血腥镇压来迫使人民屈服。它们只有在强大的人民斗争的面前，才不能不退却。南朝鲜人民的斗争和胜利证明了这个真理，日本人民的斗争和胜利同样证明了这个真理。因此，日本人民所取得的这一初步胜利，自然不能不更加激励他们反美反岸斗争的斗志，鼓舞他们再接再厉，踏着烈士们的血迹继续前进，彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约和推翻美国走狗岸信介集团的反动统治。
    日本人民的血并不是白流的。日本人民每一个反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，都是亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策，保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同斗争的一部分；日本人民所取得的每一个胜利，也是亚洲各国人民的胜利，对亚洲人民保卫和平事业作出的巨大贡献，并且是对其他正在进行反对美帝国主义侵略的亚洲人民的极大鼓舞。亚洲各国人民必将继续坚决支持日本人民反美反岸、争取独立和民主自由的斗争，直到日本人民完全实现自己的目标为止。我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于百折不挠、把斗争进行到底的英勇的日本人民！
