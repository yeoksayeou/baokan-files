The Plague God Crosses the Street
3. Everyone is His Enemy

Before Eisenhower's speech to the Philippine Congress, special agents installed detection devices in the conference hall, inspected every corner, and did not even spare the chairs, tables, and pillars.

	Claiming to "return to the old place,"
	But acting like a mouse,
	Knife lights and sword shadows in Manila,
	Guarded as if facing a formidable enemy.
	
	Hurriedly searching,
	Frantically investigating,
	Spittoons, tables, ashtrays,
	All are suspects.

    瘟神过街
    三、草木皆兵
    艾森豪威尔在菲律宾国会演说前，特务在会议厅装置侦察仪器，检查各个角落，甚至连椅子桌子柱子都不放过。
    自称“重回故地”，
    行动却像耗子，
    刀光剑影马尼拉，
    戒备如临大敌。
    急急忙忙搜寻，
    慌慌张张侦探，
    痰盂桌椅烟灰缸，
    一概都是嫌疑犯。
