    If the comrades at the spinning mill can spin yarn from wild fibers, we can weave cloth. This is the resolution we weaving workers made after seeing the spinning workers spin yarn from wild fibers. This resolution enabled us to overcome the many difficulties in weaving, thereby subduing the looms under our hands.
    I am responsible for the weaving of new products in the workshop. This time, the Party Committee gave us a glorious task, asking us to trial-produce 25 new products using 20% to 30% wild fibers. It is not without difficulties to weave cloth by blending wild fibers with raw cotton. For example, all the existing looms in the factory are two-heddle plain looms, while there are very few four-heddle looms that weave various patterns; on the other hand, wild fibers have low strength and poor elasticity, so there are many yarn breakages on the loom, making it difficult to start. Under these circumstances, we did not back down. I thought at the time:
  “Listening to the Party is never wrong, and we will definitely succeed. We must find ways to overcome the difficulties.” So we first increased the concentration of the sizing to enhance the strength of the yarn; in addition, we adjusted the heddle and shuttle throwing force on the loom, reducing the yarn breakage rate from seven or eight per minute to two or three.
    Inch by inch, various kinds of blended fabrics were woven under our hands. The khaki drill and crepe de chine blended with 30% wild fibers are of very good quality and strength, and have also increased the variety of products. At this time, I am particularly happy, and I really can't bear to leave the loom after working for a day. The workers praised the new products and wanted to buy a few feet to wear. Hearing these words, it further increased our confidence in using wild fibers to weave more high-grade fabrics. I believe that under the leadership of the Party, the various rich wild plants of the motherland will surely become new raw materials for textile enterprises, benefiting the broad masses of people.

    能纺出纱就能织成布
    金州纺织厂三织布车间工人  李忠奇
    纱场的同志们能用野生纤维纺出纱来，我们就能织出布来。这是我们织布工看到纺纱工人用野生纤维纺出纱以后所下的决心。这决心使我们突破了织布中的重重困难，从而使织布机驯服在我们手下。
    我在车间负责新产品的纺织工作。这次党委交给我们一件光荣的任务，让我们利用20％到30％的野生纤维试制出二十五种新产品。要用野生纤维与原棉混纺织布，困难是不少的。例如，厂内现有的布机全部是两片综的平纹布机，而织多种花纹的四片综的机台却很少；另一方面，野生纤维强力低、弹性差，因此布机断头多，不好开车。在这种情况下，我们没有后退。我当时想：
  “听党的话没有错，一定能成功。要想办法克服困难。”于是我们首先在浆料方面增加浓度，以增强纱线的强力；另外在布机上调整了平综、投梭力，使布机断头率由每分钟七八根下降到两三根。
    一寸寸混纺的各种各样的布在我们手下织出来。掺上30％的野生纤维混纺出的卡其布、绉纹呢等质量真不错，强力也很好，又增加了产品品种。这时我心中特别高兴，干一天活真舍不得离开车子。工人们看了新产品都夸奖，都想买几尺穿穿。听了这些话，也就更增加了我们利用野生纤维织出更多高级布的信心。我相信在党的领导下，祖国富饶的各种野生植物一定会成为纺织企业的新原料，为广大人民造福。
