This newspaper, Tianjin, 25th - Leading cadres at all levels of Longyan Iron and Steel Company have gone deep into the front lines of production, promptly resolving key issues in mine production, and promoting an all-around leap forward in production. In mid-June, compared with early June, the company's production level saw an increase of 2.5% in ore output, a 7.5% increase in mining efficiency, and a 47.2% increase in mining intensity. The iron content of the ore also increased from 50% to 51.6%.

At Pangjiabu Mine, the efficiency of drilling and blasting in the third pit was low, failing to meet production needs. Zhao Qingshan, the secretary of the mine's Party committee, led office cadres to the pit to cultivate "experimental plots." Through on-site research combining cadres, workers and technicians, they quickly summarized and promoted the experience of fast drilling and blasting created by the masses, increasing the average daily output of the entire pit by 3.5%.

The dedication of leading cadres at all levels of the company to go deep into the front lines of production has greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of the workers. The workers said, "When leaders are down the pit, we are bolder; when leaders come to the team, we are full of drive."

This newspaper, Baotou, 25th - Key leading cadres of Baogang Baiyun Obo Iron Mine have gone deep into the front lines of production to direct production, bringing a significant increase in production. The total ore output in mid-June increased by 11% compared to early June, with rich ore increasing by 64%. By the 22nd, the cumulative output of rich ore had exceeded the entire month's output in May by more than 3,800 tons.

At the beginning of June, the Iron Mine Party Committee formed a 100-person inspection team, led by members of the Party Committee Standing Committee, to go deep into various production workshops to help solve key production problems, achieving immediate results. For example, the Party Committee Secretary helped the crushing workshop strengthen equipment maintenance, resulting in a significant increase in the daily crushing of ore. From the 11th to the 15th, the average daily output of rich ore increased by more than 80% compared to the first ten days of the month.

This newspaper, Anshan, 25th - Leading cadres, management personnel, and technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel's Donganshan Iron Mine have all set up camp in work sections, teams, and groups, participating in and directing production day and night. Since mid-June, all production indicators have significantly improved compared to the first ten days of the month, with iron ore increasing by 11.5% and concentrate increasing by 13.6%.

At the beginning of June, more than 300 leading cadres, management personnel, and technical personnel from the mine level to the workshop were organized into eighteen groups and assigned to various production teams and groups, taking turns working shifts day and night. Whenever a key problem arose, leading cadres, management personnel, and technical personnel immediately combined their efforts to solve it, ensuring that key problems were resolved quickly, effectively, and with great impact. For a long time, one of the key factors affecting the increase in concentrate output was the poor settling of slime in the flotation concentrate well, resulting in the loss of a lot of concentrate. Although measures had been taken in the past, they were never completely resolved. This time, leading cadres, management personnel, and technical personnel jointly studied the problem and finally overcame this major obstacle, increasing the daily output of concentrate by more than 10% compared to the past, while also greatly reducing tailings loss.

This newspaper, Hefei, 25th - Leading cadres at all levels of the Anhui Provincial Directly Subordinate Mining General Plant have gone deep into the front lines of production, focusing on weak links such as ore transportation down the mountain and loading and unloading, ensuring the needs of increased steel production. From June 1st to 20th, the total ore transportation volume of the entire mine increased by more than 20% compared to the same period in May.

Due to the fact that the transportation down the mountain could not keep up with the demands of mining at the Anhui Provincial Directly Subordinate Mining General Plant, large quantities of ore were piled up on the mountains and could not be transported to various steel plants in a timely manner. Tian Zhong, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the General Plant, and Deputy Directors Tan Chengyuan, Qiao Hongyong, and Chen Tiefu led working groups to various branch plants to focus on ore transportation down the mountain and loading and unloading. Leading cadres of various branch plants also went deep into districts, teams, and groups, focusing on the key problems in the current ore transportation down the mountain, resulting in a significant increase in the ore transportation volume. For example, Deputy Director Tan Chengyuan and Zhang Wenzhong, Deputy Director of the Guichi Branch Plant, went deep into the front-row mountain work area of this branch plant, mobilized workers to engage in technical innovation, quickly increased two production linkage lines, and solved the contradiction between ore transportation down the mountain and loading. This reduced the loading time from 30 minutes per load to about 10 minutes, and increased the transportation volume from more than 100 tons per day in early June to more than 400 tons.

This newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th - Cadres at all levels of the Zhejiang Huzhou Steel Plant Iron Mine have gone deep into the front lines of production, leading all mine workers to vigorously engage in mine technical transformation, ensuring that ore production plans are overfulfilled every month. By June 20th, ore production had completed 94% of the annual plan.

Due to the fact that leading cadres of this mine went deep into the mines and strengthened the leadership of technical transformation, the technical revolution movement developed rapidly. Many workers promoted the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, solving equipment and technical problems. Workers Yang Guilin, Shen Chunfa, Shi Alin, and others, in response to the weak link of low efficiency in transporting ore by handcarts, connected the handcarts into "native trains" and installed steering wheels and braking equipment on the "native trains." Each time, they could transport more than two tons of ore, increasing efficiency several times over.

    到矿山上安营扎寨
    龙烟钢铁公司等企业领导干部深入第一线领导生产
    工人们说：“领导到坑下，我们胆更大；领导来小组，我们干劲足。”
    本报天津25日电　龙烟钢铁公司各级主要领导干部深入生产第一线，及时解决矿山生产关键问题，促进了生产全面跃进。6月中旬全公司的生产水平与上旬比较，矿石产量增长2．5％，采矿工效提高7．5％，采矿强度提高47．2％；矿石的含铁量也由50％提高51．6％。
    庞家堡矿三坑采矿打眼效率低、爆破慢，不能适应生产需要，矿党委书记赵庆山就率领科室干部到坑下种“试验田”，通过“三结合”现场研究，很快总结和推广了群众创造的打眼快、放炮快的经验，全坑的平均日产量提高3．5％。
    这个公司各级领导干部深入生产第一线，大大激发了职工的革命干劲和劳动热情。工人们说：“领导到坑下，我们胆更大；领导来小组，我们干劲足。”
    本报包头25日电　包钢白云鄂博铁矿主要领导干部深入生产第一线指挥生产，带来了生产的大幅度增长。矿石总产量6月中旬比上旬增加11％，其中富矿增加64％，到22日止，富矿累计产量超过5月全月产量三千八百多吨。
    6月一开始，铁矿党委就组成百人检查团，由党委常委委员率领深入到各个生产车间，帮助解决生产关键问题，收到立竿见影的效果。如党委书记帮助破碎车间加强了设备维护，每日破碎矿石有了显著的上升。11日到15日富矿平均日产量比上旬提高80％以上。
    本报鞍山25日电　鞍钢东鞍山铁矿领导干部、管理人员和技术人员同到工段、班、小组里安营扎寨，昼夜参加生产，指挥生产。6月中旬以来，各项生产指标比上旬都有很大提高，其中铁矿石提高11．5％，精矿提高13．6％。
    6月初，这个矿从矿一级到车间三百余名领导干部、管理人员和技术人员编成十八个小组，分赴各生产班、组，昼夜轮流跟班。不管任何时候，只要出现关键，领导干部、管理人员和技术人员就立即结合一起，集中力量解决，做到关键问题解决得快、解决得好、效果大。长期以来，影响精矿产量提高的关键之一，是浮选精矿大井消沉浆不好，造成很多精矿流失。过去虽然采取了措施，总未彻底解决。这次领导干部、管理人员和技术人员共同研究，终于攻下了这个大关键，使精矿日产量比过去提高10％以上，尾矿流失也大大减少。
    本报合肥25日电　安徽省直属采矿总场各级领导干部深入生产第一线，大抓矿石下山、装车运输等薄弱环节，保证了钢铁增产的需要。6月1日至20日，全矿矿石运输量比5月份同期提高20％以上。
    安徽省直属采矿总场由于下山运输跟不上开采的要求，大批矿石堆在山上不能及时运往各钢铁厂。总场党委副书记兼矿长田中和副矿长谭程远、乔鸿涌、陈铁夫分别率领工作组深入到各分场狠抓矿石下山和装车运卸；各分场领导干部也纷纷深入到区、队、组，大抓当前矿石下山中的关键问题，使矿石的运输量大增。如副矿长谭程远和贵池分场副场长张文中深入到这个分场前排山工区，发动职工大闹技术革新，很快增加了两条生产联动线，解决了矿石下山和装车的矛盾，使装车的时间由原来一次三十分钟，缩短到十分钟左右，运输量由6月上旬每天运一百多吨，提高到四百吨以上。
    本报杭州25日电　浙江湖州钢铁厂铁矿各级干部深入生产第一线，领导全矿职工大搞矿山技术改造，保证了矿石生产计划月月超额完成，到6月20日止，矿石产量已完成全年计划的94％。
    这个矿由于领导干部深入矿山，加强了技术改造的领导，技术革命运动发展很快。不少工人发扬了敢想敢做的精神，解决设备和技术问题。工人杨桂林、沈春发和施阿林等针对用手拉车运矿石效率低的薄弱环节，把一辆辆的手拉车联接成“土火车”，又在“土火车”上装上了方向盘和刹车设备。每次可运矿石二吨多，提高效率好几倍。
