    An Indestructible Dining Hall
    Fu Tongbin, First Secretary of the Liquan Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Qianxian County, Shaanxi

    The members of the Fifth Production Team of our Liquan Commune composed a folk song praising their well-run dining hall: "The public dining hall is truly good, saving grain from one province and flour from another, stoves from three provinces and coal from four, labor from five provinces and money from six, women no longer turn around the stove, returning from work to eat, men and women, young and old, all like it, after eating, laughing and talking to the fields, working hard, breaking through the sky." Indeed, this team's dining hall is getting better and better. Out of the team's 268 households, 253 have joined.

    All new things must go through continuous struggle to grow stronger. When this team's dining hall started in July last year, most members were confident in running the dining hall, while some members had doubts in their minds. The team's Party branch did not bow to difficulties. First, they explained the policy of "actively running well, voluntary participation" to the members, and implemented the method of grain being managed by the team, and the dining hall serving meals with tickets, with savings returned to the individual. At that time, 48 households signed up to join the dining hall. The Party branch's method of leading the dining hall: first, start by improving the lives of the members, eating well, eating clean and hygienic food, and saving grain. After the dining hall opened, in order to let the members eat well, Party branch secretary Tian Zhen went to the third team's kitchen to work as a cook, mobilized the cooks to contribute ideas and suggestions, and launched a technical innovation movement in cooking, using grain and vegetables mixed together to create a variety of dishes. He and the cooks created more than 70 kinds of dishes, such as radish steamed sweet plates, radish dumplings, cabbage wontons, and sesame noodles. The dining hall never serves the same meal twice, and the members like it more and more, calling this dining hall "Wan Hong Dining Hall," "All-Purpose Dining Hall," "Happiness Dining Hall," etc. The Party branch held an on-site meeting in this dining hall and promoted the method of making a variety of dishes. In order to save grain, they searched for substitute foods extensively. The dining hall used corn leaves, corn cob husks, sweet potato vines, etc. to make starch, and used starch to make more than 20 kinds of pastries, which greatly saved grain.

    The more the Party cares about the lives of the members, the greater the members' production enthusiasm. The labor attendance of women in the fourth team has increased, and production efficiency has also greatly improved. The fourth team has 19 female laborers. In the past, because they had to cook three meals a day, only four could participate in work all day. Fifteen women went to the fields late and returned early, and could only work half a day. After joining the dining hall, all 19 women in the team participated in work all day. Members said: "Life is taken care of, there is no need to worry about salt, vinegar, firewood, and noodles. Eating full makes the food taste better, and people have the energy to work." They got up and went to the fields at the crow of the rooster. Originally, each person only delivered 13 loads of manure per half-day, but now they deliver more than 50 loads. This team applied 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu to all 3,000 mu of wheat fields as early as last November, 60 days earlier than in previous years, and also completed the second application of fertilizer to all wheat fields. In the face of the recent severe drought, the members are working even harder. They have dug and completed more than 70 wells, and have irrigated 2,600 mu of wheat fields one to four times by carrying, lifting, and diverting water, determined to overcome the drought and ensure a bumper summer harvest this year. After the establishment of the dining hall, the three slows of the past became three fasts. In the past, cooking was slow, eating was slow, and going to the fields was slow. Now, eating is fast, going to the fields is fast, and working is fast. In the past, some members started their own kitchens at home, worrying about firewood, oil, salt, vinegar, and other issues. Every time there was a market, more than 20 people from the team went to the market. Now they only worry about work and don't worry about life problems. No one goes to the market unless there is something special. The members at the water conservancy construction site are even more at ease. Chang Zhencai, a member who used to go home frequently to arrange family life, no longer runs back and forth, and focuses on water conservancy. He has been rated as an A-level model worker three times in a row at the construction site.

    The better the dining hall is run, the more the members care about and support the public dining hall. Sixty-eight-year-old Han Henglu said, "I have never eaten such good food in a dining hall in my decades of life." He was so grateful that he brought the two big pumpkins he had prepared for making dumplings to the dining hall to make steamed buns. Everyone in the team loves the dining hall and cares about the dining hall. They say: "Our dining hall is indestructible." In order to run the dining hall even better, everyone put forward many reasonable suggestions to the dining hall. The dining hall manager formulated specific rules and regulations based on everyone's opinions, established detailed rules for democratic management of the dining hall, proposed methods for taking care of guests, the elderly, the sick, and children, and reformed cooking utensils to realize the mechanization of cooking stoves.

    铁打不散的食堂
    中共陕西乾县醴泉公社委员会第一书记　符同斌
    我们醴泉公社五?生产队社员编了一首民歌，赞扬他们的食堂办得好：公共食堂真正好，一省粮食二省面，三省灶具四省炭，五省劳力六省钱，妇女不再在锅边转，劳动回来就吃饭，男女老少都喜欢，饭罢说笑去田间，干活劲头冲破天。的确这个队的食堂越办越好，全队共二百六十八户，已有二百五十三户入了伙。
    凡是新生事物都要经过不断斗争才能壮大。这个队的食堂从去年7月开始办时，大部分社员对办食堂信心坚定，有部分社员思想上有疑虑，队的党支部没有向困难低头，首先就向社员讲解了“积极办好，自愿参加”的政策，按粮食保管到队，食堂凭票吃饭，节约归己的办法执行。当时就有四十八户社员报名入了食堂。这个队的党支部领导食堂的办法：首先是从改善社员生活、吃好吃饱吃得干净卫生，节省粮食上着手。食堂开伙后，为了叫社员吃好，党支部书记?天贞就下到第三小队灶房当炊事员，发动炊事员献计献策，开展作饭的技术革新运动，利用粮菜混吃，创制饭菜花样。他和炊事员创制出萝卜蒸甜盘子、萝卜包饺子、白菜馄饨、麻式面等七十多种饭菜花样。食堂顿顿不吃重样饭，社员越吃越喜欢，把这个食堂叫“万红食堂”，“万能食堂”，“幸福食堂”等，党支部就在这个食堂召开了现场会，推广了制作饭菜花样的办法。为了节约粮食，大找代食品，食堂利用玉米叶、玉米棒壳，红芋蔓等制造淀粉，利用淀粉制出二十多种糕点，这样大大节约了粮食。
    党越关心社员生活，社员的生产干劲越大，全队妇女出勤劳力增加了，生产效率也大大提高。第四小队有一十九名妇女劳力，过去因一天做三顿饭，能整日参加干活的只有四人，十五名妇女下地迟、回来早，一晌只能干半晌活。入了食堂后全队十九名妇女全部整日参加干活。社员说：生活有人管，盐醋柴面不费心，吃饭饱来吃饭香，干活人才有心劲。她们鸡叫就起来下地，原来每人一晌只送十三回粪，现在就送五十多回。这个队赶去年11月就给全队三千多亩麦田亩亩施上了万斤肥，比往年提前了六十天，又给所有麦田施完了二遍肥。在近日干旱严重的情况下，社员干劲更大，已掏、打成七十多眼井，用人力担、抬、引的办法，已给两千六百亩麦田灌了一至四次水，决心战胜干旱保证今年夏田大丰收。食堂成立后，由过去三慢变成三快，过去是做饭慢，吃饭慢，下地慢。现在是吃饭快，下地快，干活快。过去有些社员在家里起伙，日常操心柴、油、盐、醋等问题，每逢集市全队就有二十多人上街赶集，现在只操心干活，不操心生活问题，逢集市没特殊事情也没人逛集。在水利工地的社员更安心了。原来常回家安排家庭生活的社员?振才现在也不来回往家跑了，安心搞水利。他在工地一连被评为三次甲等模范。
    食堂越办越好，社员对公共食堂非常关心和拥护。六十八岁的老汉?恒禄说：“我活了几十岁没吃过食堂这样好的饭菜。”他感激得把他家准备包饺子的两个大南瓜，拿来给食堂包包子吃。社员人人爱食堂，个个关心食堂，他们说：咱这个食堂是铁打铜炼的。大家为了把食堂办得更好，向食堂提出了好多条合理化意见。食堂管理员根据大家意见，制订了具体制度，建立民主管理食堂细则，提出照顾客人、老年人、病人和小孩的办法，改革炊具，实现作饭灶具机械化。
