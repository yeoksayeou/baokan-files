    Send Imperialism to the Coffin
    Ma Sicong
    The "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" issued on the 17th by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely greatly encourage our compatriots in our territory still occupied by U.S. imperialism and strengthen their confidence in opposing U.S. imperialism. This message also illustrates a fact: U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world.
    The reputation of U.S. imperialism is getting worse and worse. It has done too many bad things, and no amount of whitewashing can cover up its ugly face. The people of the world are increasingly recognizing this guy who has never had good intentions. Today, U.S. imperialism has become a rat crossing the street, hated and beaten by everyone. During Eisenhower's "visit" this time, he was "welcomed" with blows everywhere. On the Fujian Front, the sound of our heroic People's Liberation Army's cannons rang out again. Isn't this the best way to "welcome and send off" Eisenhower! Recalling the scene of visiting the military and civilians on the Fujian Front in 1958, the magnificent sound of cannons is still ringing in my ears, and I can't help but feel bursts of joy in my heart. We must drive away all U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, drive away the robbers who have done all kinds of evil!
    The compatriots in Taiwan have suffered bullying and humiliation from American soldiers for many years, and they hate U.S. imperialism to the bone. The Japanese people have already given this plague god a cold shoulder. In South Korea, the broad masses of people are holding large-scale rallies and demonstrations to oppose war-mongers stepping on Korean soil.
    We musicians must devote ourselves to this great anti-American struggle. If our weapons are not cannons, then our music is our weapon. We must bombard forcefully like the People's Liberation Army soldiers on the Fujian Front, bombard, bombard, and never give up until we drive away U.S. imperialism.
    Chairman Mao said: The days of imperialism are numbered. This is a truth. Let us unite as one and strive to send imperialism to the coffin as soon as possible!

    把帝国主义送进棺材
    马思聪
    我国人民解放军福建前线司令部在17日发表的“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”，一定会给今天还在美帝霸占之下的我国国土上的同胞以莫大的鼓舞，增强他们反对美帝国主义的信心。这个文告还说明一个事实：美帝国主义是全世界人民共同的敌人。
    美帝国主义的名声越来越臭了，坏事做得太多了，抹什么粉也掩盖不了它的丑恶面目。全世界人民也越来越认清这个从来就不怀好意的家伙。时至今日，美帝国主义已成为人人厌恶的过街老鼠，人人喊打的东西。这次艾森豪威尔“访问”的地方，处处受到当头棒的“欢迎”。在福建前线，又响起我们英勇的解放军的炮声，这该是我们对艾森豪威尔的“迎送”的最好的方式吧！回想1958年到福建前线慰问军民的情景，雄伟的炮声还在耳边响着，心里不禁一阵阵痛快。一定要把美帝国主义及其走狗全部轰走，把做尽坏事的强盗轰走！
    台湾的同胞多年来饱受美国大兵的欺负、侮辱，他们对美帝国主义恨之入骨。日本人民已经给这个瘟神享以闭门羹了。在南朝鲜，广大的人民正在进行声势浩大的集会示威，反对战争贩子踏上朝鲜土地。
    我们音乐工作者，一定要投身到这个伟大的反美斗争中。如果我们的武器不是大炮，那么我们的乐曲就是我们的武器。我们要像福建前线的解放军战士一样，用力的轰，轰，不把美帝国主义轰走，决不罢休。
    毛主席说：帝国主义的寿命不会长了，这是一条真理，让我们万众一心，争取早日把帝国主义送进棺材！
