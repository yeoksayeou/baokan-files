    Guangdong Promotes the Revolutionary Measures of Shantou Prefecture for Improving Work Style; Tens of Thousands of Cadres Settle Down in Production Teams
    Xinjiang's 130,000 Cadres Undertake Layer-by-Layer Responsibility and "One Package to the End"; Wherever the Work is Hardest, Cadres Take the Lead
    Inner Mongolia's Cadres at All Levels Go Deep into the Fields, Creating a Lively Situation with More Cadres Participating in Production and More Consultation with the Masses

    This newspaper reports: Leadership organs at all levels in Guangdong Province are universally promoting the revolutionary measures of the Shantou Prefectural Committee for improving the work style of cadres, and leading cadres at all levels are actively leaving their offices to strengthen their leadership over the grassroots. Currently, an unprecedentedly large-scale movement of cadres going deep into the countryside and the grassroots is emerging throughout the province, following the land reform and cooperativization. Tens of thousands of leading cadres above the commune level are taking their luggage to production brigades, production teams, factories, mines, workshops, canteens, and pig farms to settle down. After going deep into the grassroots, leading cadres at all levels have carried forward the Party's fine tradition of arduous and in-depth work, adopting the posture of ordinary laborers, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, just like during the land reform and cooperativization periods. They are both students of the masses and teachers of the masses. When leading cadres at all levels go deep into the grassroots, they first settle in backward communes, backward brigades, backward factories and mines, and backward canteens, helping the cadres in these backward areas and units to specifically analyze the reasons for their backwardness and take timely measures to change the backward situation.
    After going deep into the grassroots, leading cadres at all levels can promptly understand the situation and specifically solve problems, thereby making leadership work more specific, more detailed, more solid, and more comprehensive. Guo Chun, First Secretary of the Wenchang County Committee in Hainan Administrative Region, discovered that the late-season fertilizer was insufficient in the Chongxing Commune when he was accumulating fertilizer with the commune members. At the same time, a large amount of rice straw was being discarded. He consulted with the cadres and commune members and decided to use rice straw to make compost. After this experience was promoted in the commune, more than one million dan of rice straw compost was quickly produced. Recently, the Huaxian County Committee in the suburbs of Guangzhou required each household in the commune to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains by one mu on average. At first, many cadres believed that there was no land and it was impossible to complete the task. Zhang Yuqi, First Secretary of the County Committee, who lived in the Jiutan Brigade of the Xinhua Commune, found more than 1,000 mu of wasteland, averaging 1.5 mu per household, by consulting with the masses and conducting on-site surveys, adopting methods such as planting miscellaneous grains in wasteland and orchards. The County Committee immediately promoted this experience throughout the county, and the movement to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains developed vigorously.
    A large number of leading cadres above the county level going deep into the grassroots and the front line of production have not only enriched their leadership level but also driven the grassroots cadres to improve their work style and improve their work ability. Under the impetus and influence of leading cadres at all levels, the vast number of grassroots cadres have overcome their special living conditions, taken the lead in participating in production, and shared weal and woe with the masses. According to a survey in the Hainan area, after the leading cadres of the counties settled in the grassroots, the number of cadres below the commune level participating in production increased from 74% to 95%, and the number participating in canteens increased from 59% to 95%. The leading cadres of the Leinan County Committee settled in the Yingli Commune and took the lead in influencing all 302 brigade cadres in the commune to achieve "three haves" (have hoes and manure baskets, have labor manuals, and have experimental fields), and not sit in the office, not be divorced from production, and not have a small kitchen. A new atmosphere of cadres going deep into reality, participating in more labor, conducting more investigations and research, and discovering and solving problems quickly has emerged everywhere.
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi reports: Eating, living, laboring, and consulting with commune members has become a system among cadres of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Since spring, 130,000 cadres across the region have been participating in production and leading production in various people's communes, participating in canteens and leading canteens, becoming leaders in the production and life of the masses. At present, the sowing plan for grain crops in the region has been overfulfilled. The 17 million mu of wheat in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have large ears and full grains and will soon be harvested.
    Based on the characteristics of Xinjiang's many ethnic groups, vast territory, scattered rural areas, and few grassroots cadres, the Autonomous Region Party Committee implemented a system of layer-by-layer responsibility and "one package to the end" for cadres at all levels throughout the region this spring. More than 80% of the cadres in the region, including members of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, ministers of various departments, vice-chairmen of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, and directors of various departments and bureaus, as well as leading cadres of the prefectural and county party committees, have gone to the front line of agricultural production. Some have also directly served as leaders (deputies) of counties, communes, management districts, and even production teams, directly participating in leadership work.
    The cadres who went to the countryside went deep into the fields, acting as both commanders and production workers, leading the vast number of commune members to successfully complete the production tasks in various periods. When the Autonomous Region Party Committee called for expanding the sown area of grain crops, cadres at all levels immediately went to the front line of land reclamation, leading the masses to reclaim land, build water conservancy projects, and sow seeds at the same time. In half a year, they reclaimed more than 5 million mu of fertile land with water conservancy facilities, tens of thousands of mu more than the total reclaimed in the previous year. More than 1,500 cadres from the first-level organs of the Autonomous Region went to Hami, Changji, and the Turpan Basin, contracting more than 100 people's communes. They took the lead in expeditions to the sandy wilderness, built water conservancy projects, and by the end of May, they had expanded the cultivated area in this area by more than 1 million mu and built more than 100 canals, reservoirs, and karez wells.
    The cadres who went deep into the grassroots not only grasped production but also focused on the lives of commune members with the canteen as the center. All people's communes have established Party Secretary experimental canteens, and many cadres have gone to third-class canteens to work as accountants, managers, and cooks. Now, more than 30,000 canteens in the region are getting better and better, and more than 90% have reached the level of first-class or second-class.
    The vast number of cadres share the same breath and destiny as the masses, taking the lead in everything, and generally achieving that wherever it is hardest, cadres appear there. In the spring, when a heavy snowstorm hit the Altay and Tacheng grasslands, the secretaries and commissioners of the Tacheng and Altay Prefectural Committees and the secretaries of the county party committees immediately braved the snowstorm and took care of the sheep with the herdsmen, overcoming the snowstorm disaster and ensuring the safe passage of millions of livestock through the disaster period. Recently, some crops in Kuche County were damaged by hail. Duan Duoyu, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Secretary Yang Qingshan led the cadres of the entire county to the disaster area and replanted seedlings with the masses. Within seven days, they replanted all 20,000 mu of disaster-stricken land with rice and other crops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 29th. Nearly 100,000 cadres in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have gone deep into the fields to lead commune members in a summer hoeing campaign.
    Cadres of all ethnic groups eat, live, work, and consult with commune members, so that summer hoeing and other field management achieve the requirements of fast progress and good quality. According to statistics on June 21, the region had hoeed more than 33.92 million mu of land, an increase of 45% over the same period last year.
    Cadres going deep into the fields have strengthened specific leadership over production and are deeply welcomed by commune members. Zhao Jingtang, First Secretary of the Kalaqin Banner of the Communist Party of China, led more than 1,000 cadres to serve as deputy captains in the commune production teams, participating in production and leading production, which dramatically increased the attendance rate of commune members in the banner from 80% to 95%. After more than 2,000 cadres from the Zhaqi Special Banner of the Hulunbuir League joined forces in the fields, they drove nearly 80% of the rural labor force to participate in field management. More than 90% of the crops in the banner had been hoeed for the first time by early June, and they are now rushing to hoe for the second time. Shi Guanghua, First Secretary of the Jerim League Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently led more than 500 cadres to go deep into the front line of production. They participated in labor during the day and helped summarize and arrange work in the evening, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of commune members. A lively situation of "more cadres participating in production, more meetings in the fields, and more consultation with the masses" has now emerged in various banners and counties in this league.

    本报讯　广东省各地领导机关普遍推行汕头地委改进干部作风的革命措施，各级领导干部纷纷走出办公室，切实加强对基层的领导。现在，一个继土地改革和合作化以后空前大规模的干部深入农村、深入基层的运动已在全省出现，成千上万的公社以上的领导干部带着行李到生产大队、生产队、厂矿、车间、食堂、猪场安家落户。各级领导干部在深入基层后，发扬了党的艰苦深入的优良传统，像土改和合作化时期一样，以普通劳动者的姿态，与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，既做群众的学生，又做群众的先生。各级领导干部深入基层时，都首先落户到后进公社、后进大队、后进厂矿、后进食堂，帮助这些后进地区和单位的干部，具体分析落后原因，及时采取措施改变落后面貌。
    各级领导干部深入基层后，能够及时地了解情况，具体地解决问题，从而使领导工作更具体、更细致、更踏实、更全面。海南行政区文昌县委第一书记郭春，在重兴公社和社员一起积肥时，发现这个公社晚造肥料不足，同时又有大批稻草丢弃不用。他便同干部、社员商量，用稻草沤肥。这一经验在公社推广后，很快就沤制了稻草肥一百多万担。广州市郊区花县县委最近要求各公社平均每户扩种一亩杂粮，开始有不少干部认为没有土地，无法完成任务。住在新华公社九潭大队的县委第一书记张玉琦，与群众商量研究和实地勘察后，采取杂粮进荒地、入果园等办法，找到了一千多亩荒地，平均每户有一亩半。县委立即将这一经验向全县推广介绍，全县扩种杂粮的运动就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    大批县以上领导干部深入基层，深入生产第一线，不仅丰富了自己的领导水平，也带动了基层干部改进作风和提高了他们的工作能力。广大基层干部在各级领导干部的带动和影响下，克服了生活特殊化，带头参加生产，和群众同甘共苦。据海南区的调查，在各县领导干部到基层安家落户后，公社以下干部参加生产的人数由原来的74％增加到95％，参加食堂的由59％增加到95％。雷南县委的领导干部到英利公社落户，带头影响全社三百零二个大队干部都做到了“三有”
  （有锄头粪箕、有劳动手册、有试验田），和不坐办公室、不脱离生产、不开小灶。各地普遍出现了干部深入实际多、参加劳动多、调查研究多和发现问题快、解决问题快的新气象。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　和社员群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，已经在新疆维吾尔自治区各族干部中形成一种制度。全区有十三万名干部从春季以来就在各地人民公社参加生产领导生产，参加食堂领导食堂，成为群众生产和生活上的带头人。目前全区粮食作物播种计划已超额完成。天山南北一千七百多万亩小麦穗大粒满，即将开镰收割。
    自治区党委根据新疆民族众多、地区辽阔、农村分散和基层干部少的特点，今年春季就在全区范围内实行了各级干部层层下包和一包到底的制度。全区80％以上的干部，包括自治区党委常委、各部部长，自治区人民委员会副主席、各厅局长，和地委、县委领导干部，都走上农业生产第一线，一部分还直接担任了县、公社、管理区以至生产队的领导职务（副职），直接参与领导工作。
    下到农村的干部们深入田间，既是指挥员又是生产员，带动广大社员胜利地完成各个时期生产任务。当自治区党委号召扩大粮食作物播种面积的时候，各级干部立即走上开荒前线，领导群众边开荒，边修水利，边播种，半年就开垦出五百多万亩具有水利设施的良田，比去年全年开垦的还多出几十万亩。自治区一级机关下到哈密、昌吉和吐鲁番盆地的一千五百多名干部，包干一百多个人民公社。他们带头远征沙荒，兴修水利，到5月底就使这个地区扩大耕地面积一百多万亩，修成一百多道水渠、水库和坎儿井。
    深入基层的干部们，既抓生产，又以食堂为中心抓好社员生活。各人民公社都建立了党委书记试验食堂，许多干部到三类食堂当会计员、管理员和炊事员。现在全区三万多个食堂越办越好，90％以上都达到了一类或二类的水平。
    广大干部与群众同呼吸，共命运，事事带头，普遍做到哪里最艰苦，干部就在哪里出现。春季，在大风雪袭击阿勒泰和塔城草原的时候，塔城、阿勒泰地委书记、专员和各县县委书记、公社党委书记立即冒着风雪，同牧民一起护理羊群，战胜了风雪灾害，使几百万头牲畜安全度过灾期。库车县最近被冰雹打坏一部分作物，县委第一书记段多玉和书记杨青山带领全县干部赶到灾区，同群众一道查苗补种，七天内就使两万亩受灾地全部补种了水稻等作物。
    据新华社呼和浩特29日电　内蒙古自治区近十万名干部深入田间，领导社员突击夏锄。
    各族干部与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，使夏锄等田间管理达到进度快、质量好的要求。到6月21日统计，全区已锄头遍地三千三百九十二万多亩，比去年同期增加45％。
    干部深入田间，加强了对生产的具体领导，深受社员欢迎。中共喀喇沁旗第一书记赵景堂率领一千多名干部到公社生产队担任副队长，参加生产领导生产，使全旗社员出勤率由80％猛增到95％。呼伦贝尔盟扎赍特旗两千多名干部会师田间后，带动了农村近80％的劳动力都参加了田间管理工作，全旗90％以上的作物在6月上旬已锄完头遍，现正抢锄二遍。中共哲里木盟委第一书记石光华最近也率领五百多名干部深入生产第一线，他们白天参加劳动，晚上帮助总结安排工作，使社员们干劲倍增。这个盟的各旗县现已出现“干部参加生产多，地头会议多，有事与群众商量多”的活跃局面。（附图片）
