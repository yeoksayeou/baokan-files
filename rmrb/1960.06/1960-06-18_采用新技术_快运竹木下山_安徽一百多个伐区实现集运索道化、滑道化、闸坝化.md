    Adopting New Technologies to Speed Up Bamboo and Timber Transport Down Mountains
    Anhui's Over One Hundred Logging Areas Achieve Centralized Transportation Through Cableways, Slides, and Dams
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch on June 17th) Anhui Province's forestry workers are vigorously engaged in technological innovation in bamboo and timber logging site transport, ensuring sustained leaps forward in production. In eight key bamboo and timber producing counties, including Jixi, 126 logging areas across the province have basically achieved cableway, slide, and vehicle-based centralized transport of bamboo and timber at logging sites, eliminating the need for shoulder carrying. Simultaneously, some small rivers have been dammed. In the past, producing one cubic meter of timber required 16.4 labor days; now, it only requires 8.6 labor days.
    Anhui Province's bamboo and timber production is primarily concentrated in the southern Anhui and Dabie Mountains, where the terrain is steep and transportation is extremely inconvenient. In the past, bamboo and timber transport relied entirely on shoulder carrying, resulting in extremely low efficiency. This year, a large-scale technological innovation and revolution movement has penetrated the mountainous regions. Across the province, 1,215 new cableways, slides, and vehicle routes have been built, totaling 1,714 kilometers in length; 61 river channels have been dredged, extending 721 kilometers; and 1,113 various dams have been constructed. Many logging areas have also established integrated automatic production lines for felling, skidding, and transporting. Timber is transported from logging sites directly to the riverbank via slides and waterways.
    Anhui's forestry areas have rationally laid out their technological innovations based on terrain characteristics. For example, cableways are erected in areas with peaks, valleys, cliffs, and steep slopes where transportation is extremely difficult; various slides are laid out on general slopes; wooden rail and plank roads are constructed at the foot of the mountains; and temporary straw dams, earth dams, or permanent stone dams are built on rivers and streams based on the volume of bamboo and timber and the size of the flow, to fully utilize water resources and achieve year-round floatation.
    For example, the Sanyang logging area in Shexian County has erected an 800-meter-long non-powered double-line steel cable aerial cableway between Baihechi and Yanwo Mountain, at an altitude of over 1,300 meters. Each trip can transport 0.4 cubic meters of timber. Seven workers operating the cableway can transport 31.5 cubic meters of timber per day, increasing efficiency by 24 times compared to manual shoulder carrying. To change the passive situation of narrow river channels, shallow and rapidly flowing water, intense floods during rains, and rapid water recession after rains in mountainous areas, which prevented year-round timber floatation, forestry workers have implemented a method of building dams section by section, storing water section by section, and opening dams to release water, thus ensuring year-round timber floatation on mountain rivers.
    While vigorously engaging in the reform of bamboo and timber transport tools, Anhui's forestry areas are also striving to make each innovation project into a series, a chain, a complete set, and a dragon, so that the innovative tools can play a greater role. For example, the Laibang logging area in Yuexi County is located in Huangbai Mountain and Dagang Ridge, which are large, steep, and have dangerous roads. Although some timber skidding tools were reformed in the past, they were not integrated and could not adapt to the requirements of this complex terrain, so transporting timber required detours of twenty-five li. This year, the workers in this logging area created a water-timber mixed slide, with a total length of 31.5 li. This water-timber mixed slide can fully utilize the impact of the stream water to increase the sliding speed of timber, solving the problem that timber could not slide on gentle slopes in the past. It is also connected to advanced tools such as cableways and automatic circuitous cartways, reducing many loading and unloading procedures, so that timber can automatically flow from the logging site directly to the riverbank.

    采用新技术  快运竹木下山
    安徽一百多个伐区实现集运索道化、滑道化、闸坝化
    本报合肥17日电　安徽省林业职工大搞竹木山场集运技术革新，保证了生产持续跃进。全省已有绩溪等八个竹木生产重点县，一百二十六个伐区基本实现了竹木山场集运索道化、滑道化、车子化，消灭了肩挑人扛。同时，一部分小河实现了闸坝化。过去生产一立方米木材，需用十六点四个劳动日，现在只需八点六个。
    安徽省竹木生产主要集中在皖南和大别山区，山势陡峭，交通极不方便。过去竹木集运全靠肩扛人抬，效率极低。今年，大规模的技术革新和技术革命运动深入了山区，全省新建各种索道、滑道、车子道一千二百一十五条，计长一千七百一十四公里，整治河道六十一条，长达七百二十一公里；建造各种闸坝一千一百一十三座。很多伐区还建成了采伐、集材、运输一条龙的自动线，木材通过滑道和溪水从山场一直传送到河边。
    安徽林区的技术革新根据地形特点，进行了合理布局。如在山峰、山谷、悬崖陡壁等运输十分困难的地方，就架设索道；在一般坡地就铺设各种滑道；在山脚地段就铺设木轨道、板车道；在河溪上，根据竹木数量和流量大小，分别建筑临时草坝、土坝或永久性的石坝，以充分利用水源，达到常年流放。
    如歙县三阳伐区在海拔一千三百多米的白鹤池和燕窝山之间架设了一条八百米长的无动力双线钢丝空中索道，每次可运出木材零点四立方米，七人操作每日可运出木材三十一点五立方米，比人工肩扛提高工效二十四倍。为了改变山区河道狭窄、水浅弯急、雨大水猛、雨停水消，不能常年流送木材的被动局面，林区工人实行了节节筑坝，节节蓄水，开坝放水，随水放排的办法，保证了山河常年流送木材。
    安徽省林区在大搞竹木集运工具改革的同时，还努力使每个革新项目成列、成串、成套、成龙，使革新工具发挥更大的作用。如岳西县来榜伐区位于黄柏山、大岗岭，山大、坡陡、道路险阻，过去虽然改革了一些集材工具，但不成龙，不能适应这种复杂地形的要求，运输木材要绕道二十五华里。今年，这个伐区工人创造了一种水木混合滑道，全长三十一点五华里，这种水木混合滑道，能充分利用溪水的冲击力量，增加木材的滑行速度，解决了过去缓坡木材不能滑行的问题。并且和索道、自动巡回车道等先进工具连接起来，减少了许多装卸工序，木材可以从山场一直自动流送到河边。
