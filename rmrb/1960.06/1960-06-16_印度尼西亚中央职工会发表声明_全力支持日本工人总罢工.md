Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 15th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported today that the National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union, on behalf of its 2.7 million members, issued a statement on the 14th, expressing its full support for the Japanese workers' general strike against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

The statement pointed out that the aim of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is to prepare for a new war and to support Japanese militarism, which has long been opposed by Japanese workers and the people. This treaty violates the wishes of the Japanese people and constitutes a dangerous threat by Japanese fascists to carry out criminal aggression against countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia. The statement said that it is no wonder that Japanese workers and the people unanimously oppose this treaty, demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and oppose Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

The statement said that the struggle of the Japanese workers and the people is consistent with the struggle of the Indonesian people. Indonesian workers and the Japanese people are currently engaged in struggles against aggressive military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, against any fascist danger from home and abroad, and to achieve lasting world peace.

The statement called on all Indonesian workers to fully support the struggle of the Japanese workers and the people.

The statement concluded that in the international situation where the days of imperialism are numbered, the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union firmly believes that the struggle of the people of all countries for national independence, democracy and peace will surely achieve final victory.

    印度尼西亚中央职工会发表声明
    全力支持日本工人总罢工
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会14日以二百七十万会员的名义发表声明，表示全力支持日本工人反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的总罢工。
    声明指出，新日美“安全条约”的目的是为新战争作准备，是为了扶植早就受到日本工人和人民反对的日本军国主义。这个条约违背日本人民的愿望，同时构成日本法西斯分子对远东和东南亚国家进行罪恶侵略的危险。声明说，无怪乎日本工人和人民一致反对这个条约，并要求岸信介政府下台和反对艾森豪威尔“访问”日本。
    声明说，日本工人和人民的斗争同印度尼西亚人民的斗争是一致的。印度尼西亚工人和日本人民目前正在从事斗争，反对东南亚条约组织等侵略性军事集团，反对来自国内和国外的任何法西斯危险，争取实现全世界的持久和平。
    声明号召印度尼西亚全体工人全力支持日本工人和人民的斗争。
    声明最后说，在帝国主义的末日屈指可数的国际形势，全印度尼西亚中央职工会深信，各国人民争取民族独立、民主与和平的斗争一定将获得最后的胜利。
