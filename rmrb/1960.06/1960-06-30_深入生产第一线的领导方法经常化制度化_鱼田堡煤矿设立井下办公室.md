Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: The Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing has implemented a significant reform in leadership methods and enterprise management based on the characteristics of coal mine production: each mine has established underground production offices, implementing a day and night underground office system.

The underground office of this mine is composed of the mine leader and personnel in charge of production scheduling, raw material supply, equipment maintenance and repair, and health care, divided into three shifts, rotating day and night. At the same time, on-site warehouses have also been established underground. This has made the leadership's method of going deep into the production front lines regular and institutionalized, making leadership work more specific and detailed, and resolving problems more timely and accurately, powerfully guaranteeing the continuous rise of production. In the first half of June, the coal output of this mine increased by 6.6% compared to the same period last month.

This significant reform in leadership methods and enterprise management has been developed on the basis of cadres going deep into the production front lines and cultivating "experimental plots." Since the Great Leap Forward, the mine's leading cadres have gone down the wells to cultivate "experimental plots" and directed production on-site, which has greatly promoted production. However, because these leadership methods have not been fully institutionalized, cadres went down the wells more often when organizing high-yield or crash tasks, while regular command work was still carried out on the ground. Therefore, cadres could not always discover and solve problems in production as timely and rapidly as they could on-site, failing to keep up with the rapidly changing situation on the production site.

In order to solve this problem, in May this year, the Yutianpu Coal Mine Party Committee decided that in addition to continuing to adhere to the system of mine-level leading cadres going down the wells to cultivate "experimental plots" and follow shifts to work, it would establish formal and fixed underground production command organizations in each mine, implementing a system of mine leaders and relevant auxiliary departments' personnel going down the wells on duty. Their approach to implementing this new leadership system is to divide the original administrative management departments of each mine into two major parts, above ground and underground. The underground part is responsible for the direct command of the production of the shift on duty; the above-ground part is responsible for the more long-term production plans, raw material supply, labor allocation, employee life, cultural education, and scientific research arrangements. This creates a division of labor between the front line and the second line, between long-term arrangements and daily and shift-based production leadership, while also maintaining close connections. The leadership method of the mine leader on duty underground is "three same and one package," that is, going to work and getting off work with the workers, working together, and contracting responsibility for the production tasks of the shift. When the mine leader on duty goes to work, he participates in the workers' pre-shift meeting, explaining the tasks and measures to the workers; after work, he participates in the workers' evaluation meeting, helping the workers summarize experiences and lessons learned. During production, the mine leader uses the "combination of point and surface" method, both patrolling various work faces to understand the situation and going deep into key and weak links to "squat," following shifts to work, specifically helping to solve problems. The mine leader on duty also grasps political and ideological work and mobilizes the masses under the unified leadership of the Party branch on duty.

Practice over the past month or so has proven that setting up offices underground has many benefits. First, mine-level cadres no longer rely on listening to telephone reports, but command production based on the on-site situation. Therefore, in leading production work, subjectivism can be avoided or reduced, and leadership work can be done more thoroughly, meticulously, and practically. Second, many problems can be discovered and solved on the spot, avoiding the previous phenomenon of cadres traveling back and forth from the ground to the underground, wasting time. Third, the repair and maintenance of equipment and the supply of raw materials have been strengthened, ensuring safe production. Fourth, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened. The masses unanimously responded very well to this leadership method; believing that problems were solved quickly and well. For example, in the past, because there was no system of electromechanical workers being on duty underground, when the electric chute broke down, it took a long time to repair it, delaying a lot of production time. Now, when an accident occurs with the electric chute, electromechanical workers arrive at the scene of the accident within minutes to carry out repairs. After the establishment of raw material warehouses underground, the supply of raw materials is also more timely than in the past, avoiding the phenomenon of no raw materials on the work face, and ensuring balanced production. Because there are fixed leading cadres commanding shifts day and night, and personnel from various auxiliary departments are serving production, the production situation on the night shift has changed greatly. In the first ten days of June, the average daily output of the night shift not only exceeded the average daily production level of the night shift in the first half of May, but also high-yield records of the night shift output catching up with and surpassing the day shift have appeared in each mine.

In the process of implementing this major reform, the Yutianpu Coal Mine Party Committee strengthened the political and ideological education work of employees and adopted the method of gradually promoting it comprehensively after everything had been tested. When the underground office was first established, some people were not used to it, and some dispatchers even requested a return to the original state, believing that it was not easy to direct the work of ground auxiliary departments underground. The Mine Party Committee specifically convened a meeting of dispatchers, mobilizing everyone to discuss "Can the underground command the ground work?" After discussion, everyone believed that in the past, the ground could command the underground, but now the underground can command the ground even more, because working underground provides a more accurate and rapid understanding of the production situation; from the perspective of production requirements, the underground is the production front line, and the ground is the logistics department, and the logistics department must obey the needs of the front line and serve the front line. At the same time, the Party Committee also made arrangements for specific issues such as how the mine leader on duty can combine point and surface, and how the underground can command the ground auxiliary departments. This experience was piloted in One Mine from mid-April, and after debate and gradual summing up of experience, it was generally promoted throughout the mine in May.

While establishing underground offices, the Yutianpu Coal Mine further implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, and vigorously strengthened group work. First, it established and improved the core leadership of the production team and expanded the team's business personnel, increasing them from the original "four major members" to "eight major members," so that everyone participates in management and everything is managed by someone. By opening training courses, providing specific on-site guidance, and summarizing and promoting advanced team work experience, the ideological and management level of team leaders was greatly improved. General production problems are directly resolved in the team, and problems involving a larger scope of labor, technical strength, and raw material allocation are resolved uniformly by the underground office. This avoids the previous phenomenon of all matters, regardless of size, having to go through the mine leader, as well as the back-and-forth hassle. At the same time, the mine leader can also concentrate on solving some more significant problems in production.

    深入生产第一线的领导方法经常化制度化
    鱼田堡煤矿设立井下办公室
    在现场指挥生产，领导切合实际，问题发现得快，解决得快，干群关系更加密切
    新华社重庆29日电　重庆市鱼田堡煤矿根据煤矿生产的特点，在领导方法和企业管理上实行了一项重大的改革：各个矿井在井下设立生产办公室，实行井下日夜办公制度。
    这个矿的井下办公室，是由井长带领的生产调度、原材料供应、设备维护检修、卫生保健等人员组成，分为三班，昼夜轮流。与此同时，还在井下建立了现场仓库。这样，就使领导干部深入生产第一线的领导方法成为经常化、制度化，领导工作做得更具体、细致，解决问题更及时、准确，有力地保证了生产持续上升。6月上半月，这个矿的煤产量比上月同期增长6．6％。
    这一领导方法和企业管理的重大改革，是在干部深入生产第一线、种“试验田”的基础上发展起来的。大跃进以来，这个矿的领导干部下井种“试验田”、到井下现场指挥生产，对促进生产起了很大作用。但是，由于这些领导方法还没有完全制度化，干部在组织高产或突击任务的时候下井较多，而经常的指挥工作，仍然是在地面上。因此干部不能经常像在现场那样及时、迅速地发现和解决生产中的问题，跟不上生产现场那种日新夜异的形势。
    为了解决这个问题，在今年5月间鱼田堡煤矿党委决定除继续坚持矿一级领导干部下井种“试验田”、跟班劳动等制度外，在各矿井建立井下正规的固定的生产指挥机构，实行井长和有关辅助部门的人员下井值班的制度。他们实行这一新的领导制度的作法是：将原来各井行政管理部门分为井上井下两大部分，井下部分担负当班生产的直接指挥任务；井上部分则负责比较长期的生产计划、原材料供应、劳动力调配、职工生活、文化教育和科学研究等安排。这样来使第一线和第二线、长期安排和每日每班的生产领导，既有分工，又紧密联系。井下值班井长的领导方法是：“三同一包”，即与工人同上班、同下班、同劳动，包干负责当班生产任务。值班井长上班时参加工人班前会，向工人交代任务和措施；下班后参加工人的评比会，帮助工人总结经验教训。在生产进行中，井长运用“点面结合”的方法，既巡回各工作面了解情况，又深入重点和薄弱环节“蹲点”，跟班劳动，具体帮助解决问题。值班井长还在当班党支部统一领导下，抓政治思想工作和发动群众的工作。
    通过最近一个多月的实践，证明井下设办公室有很大好处。第一，井级干部不再是凭听电话汇报，而是根据现场情况来指挥生产。因此在领导生产的工作中，可以避免或减少主观主义，领导工作可以作得更深入、细致、踏实。第二，许多问题能够就地发现，就地解决，避免了以往干部从地面到井下往返耽误时间的现象。第三，加强了设备的修理维护和原材料的供应工作，保证了安全生产。第四，进一步密切了干部与群众的关系。对于这种领导方法，群众一致反映很好；认为问题解决得又快又好。例如，过去由于没有机电工人在井下值班的制度，电溜子发生了故障，因不能很快修好耽误很多生产时间。现在电溜子发生了事故，机电工人在几分钟内，就到达事故发生地点进行检修。井下建立原材料仓库以后，原材料的供应也比过去更加及时，避免了以往工作面上无原材料的现象，保证了均衡生产。由于井下日夜三班有固定的领导干部指挥，各辅助部门的人员为生产服务，因此夜班生产情况发生了很大变化。6月上旬夜班平均日产量，不仅超过了5月上半月的夜班平均日产水平，而且各井都出现过夜班产量赶上、超过白班的高产纪录。
    在实现这一重大改革的过程中，鱼田堡煤矿党委加强了对职工的政治思想教育工作，并且采取了一切经过试验的逐步全面推广的方法。开始设立井下办公室时，有些人不习惯，有的调度员甚至要求恢复原状，认为在井下不好指挥地面辅助部门的工作。矿党委专门召开了调度员会议，发动大家进行讨论“井下能不能指挥地面工作”？经过讨论，大家认为，过去地面能指挥井下，现在井下更能够指挥地面，因为在井下办公对生产的情况了解得更准确更迅速；从生产要求上说，井下是生产第一线，地面是后勤部，后勤部必须服从第一线需要，为第一线服务。与此同时，党委对于井长值班时如何做到点面结合，以及井下如何指挥地面辅助部门等具体问题，也作了安排。这一经验从4月中旬开始在一井试点以后，经过辩论和逐步总结经验，到5月份，就在全矿普遍推广。
    鱼田堡煤矿在建立井下办公室的同时，进一步贯彻“两参一改三结合”的制度，大力加强了小组工作。首先，建立和健全了生产小组的核心领导，并扩大了小组的业务员，由原来的“四大员”增加为“八大员”，做到人人参加管理，事事有人管理。并通过开办训练班，现场具体指导，总结和推广先进的小组工作经验等办法，大力提高小组长的思想水平和管理水平，生产上的一般问题直接在小组解决，属于较大范围的劳动力、技术力量、原材料调配等问题，由井下办公室统一解决。这样，就避免了以往不分大小事情都要经过井长，以及往返周折的现象。同时，井长也能集中力量解决生产上一些比较重大的问题。
