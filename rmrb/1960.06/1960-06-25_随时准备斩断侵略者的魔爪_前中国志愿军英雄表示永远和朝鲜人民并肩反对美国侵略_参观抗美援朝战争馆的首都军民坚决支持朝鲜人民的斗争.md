Xinhua News Agency, 24th: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of "June 25th," former heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army gathered, held discussions, and gave reports, denouncing the crimes of the American bandits in occupying South Korea, dividing and obstructing Korea's peaceful reunification, and intensifying war provocations. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the Korean people's just struggle to drive out the American bandits and peacefully reunify their motherland.

The bloody crimes of the American bandits' invasion of Korea and massacre of the Korean people, and the recent war clamoring of "Plague God" Eisenhower in South Korea, aroused boundless anger among the Volunteer Army heroes. Xu Henglu, a first-class hero of the Volunteer Army who crossed the Yalu River in October 1950 to strike a heavy blow against the American invading army, said that the American bandits committed monstrous crimes in Korea. The beasts used the most barbarous and cruel means such as airplanes, cannons, and germ bombs to destroy countless beautiful and peaceful towns in Korea and killed countless kind and lovely people. From the Yalu River to the South Han River, we personally saw many "mass graves" burying Korean people who were collectively killed by the American bandits. Blood debts must be paid with blood! We defeated the American wolves together with the Korean people. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has long withdrawn and returned to the country, but the American bandits are still clinging to South Korea and want to kill and set fires again, which is absolutely intolerable. Wu Shengkai, a famous hero of the Volunteer Army Air Force, angrily said that American imperialism is frantically expanding its military and preparing for war in South Korea, establishing missile bases and transporting atomic weapons, and destroying the Korean Armistice Agreement. Recently, when "Plague God" Eisenhower climbed onto South Korea, he also vigorously touted the "strength" of the American troops invading Korea, clamoring that South Korea is "a very important border for maintaining freedom," and also held provocative military parades not far south of the ceasefire line. This once again clearly shows the aggressive nature of American imperialism. We will never allow it to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and we will never allow it to act recklessly again.

The Volunteer Army heroes, with their glorious achievements in defeating the American aggressors together with the heroic Korean people, have been giving reports to the masses across the country for days, further making people recognize the paper tiger nature of American imperialism. Gao Yunhe, a second-class hero of the Volunteer Army who participated in the fierce annihilation of the American "ace" First Cavalry Division in the autumn of 1951, said that he led a squad of soldiers to hold a high ground on the east bank of the Linjin River. The American invading army used a large number of airplanes and cannons as cover, rushing up fiercely like a pack of wolves. But we knew they were "straw bags," ignoring them from a distance, and when they got close, we fired machine guns, rifles, and grenades at them, directly beating these American young masters to death and injury. The living ones rolled and crawled down, even abandoning the wounded and weapons. In five days and nights of continuous fighting, our squad, together with fraternal units, eliminated more than two thousand enemies. He said: "This is the 'ace' army boasted by the United States, but in our hands, it became a tofu army." Zhang Dexin, the former Volunteer Army company commander who led an anti-aircraft artillery company to shoot down and wound fifty American aircraft, said in the report meeting: The United States is a complete "teacher," a guy who bullies the weak and fears the strong. In the early days of the Korean War, the American aerial bandits were truly rampant and extremely arrogant. But as soon as our anti-aircraft guns fired, it became a "bear," and plane after plane was shot down by us, falling to the ground like flies with their heads turned. Many former Volunteer Army heroes who participated in the famous Battle of Yunshan, Battle of Changjin Lake, the Great Victory of Shangganling, and the Defense of Kaesong, described the various embarrassing appearances of the American invading army with their personal experiences. They said that the American young master soldiers' surrender movements were very "standard": raising their hands, drooping their heads, kneeling to beg for mercy, and then bowing respectfully to us to surrender. Yang Yucai, a former first-class hero of the Volunteer Army, said: If American imperialism dares to launch a new war of aggression, the defeat on the Korean battlefield awaits it.

The heroes firmly believe that the heroic Korean people who defeated American imperialism will surely achieve the final victory. Lin Wengui, a former first-class meritorious service of the Volunteer Army and instructor, said: "After we returned to the motherland from Korea, we have been concerned about the heroic struggle of the Korean people all the time. The suffering of the Korean people is our suffering; the enemy of the Korean people is our enemy."

Xinhua News Agency, 24th: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of the great war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, in which the heroic Korean people fought valiantly against American aggression, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum has received a large number of visitors in recent days. The large number of historical relics displayed here concentratedly expose the gangster face of American imperialism, which persists in aggression and is fond of war. The vast number of visitors unanimously expressed their firm support for the Korean people's just struggle to resist American aggression and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, to drive the American aggressors out of South Korea, out of our territory Taiwan, and out of Asia.

Zhao Jixiu, a worker at the Beijing Canvas Factory, said during his visit that the Korean War, which shocked the world ten years ago, was launched single-handedly by the American warmonger Dulles in Korea. Then, the American invading army occupied our territory Taiwan. Ten years later, the American bandits still occupy South Korea and our territory Taiwan, and "Plague God" Eisenhower recently climbed onto our territory Taiwan and South Korea to carry out war conspiracy activities. This fully shows that American imperialism is engaged in aggression and war. This also tells us that we should not have unrealistic illusions about imperialism, we must be vigilant, and be ready at all times to chop off the aggressor's claws. Lu Yandong, a white-clad warrior who participated in the anti-bacterial warfare in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, angrily exposed the heinous crimes of American imperialism in carrying out the inhumane bacterial warfare when she saw the shells of germ bombs used by the American invading army and the evidence of scattering bacteria-laden flies, fleas, frogs, etc., displayed in the museum to the medical workers who came to visit with her. She said: "American imperialism is the most barbarous and inhuman executioner who slaughtered the Korean people. Peace-loving people all over the world should stand up to stop American aggression."

The many photos, materials, and objects displayed in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum, which showed the US sabotage of the Korean armistice and its conspiracy to stage a comeback and launch a war of aggression, aroused high vigilance among the vast audience. American imperialism unilaterally abolished the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of sending reinforcement weapons into Korea, but stepped up arming the South Korean puppet army, constantly sent spies and agents across the "38th parallel" to spy on military intelligence, and actively planned a new war. All these pieces of evidence have forcefully smashed its "peace" signboard, nakedly revealing its jackal-like ferocious appearance, and the people of the world must maintain high vigilance.

Tens of thousands of spectators saw the large piles of flags, caps, badges, shoulder patches, guns, and other war trophies of the American invading army and the accomplice army and the Li puppet army captured by the Volunteer Army heroes, and saw the photos of the American army being beaten to a slump, dejected and fleeing in embarrassment, and clapped their hands and applauded excitedly. They said: "To deal with the American bandits, we must beat them hard!" Zhang Jiahai, a worker and militiaman at the Beijing Bearing Factory, said when he saw the cowardly appearance of the American soldiers who were "escape fanatics," that "this fully shows that the American bandits are nothing more than a seemingly powerful paper tiger."

Among the visiting crowd, many workers, peasants, government cadres, and demobilized soldiers who had volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea were very concerned about the Korean people's struggle against American aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. They all expressed their firm support for the Korean people's just struggle against American imperialism.

    随时准备斩断侵略者的魔爪
    前中国志愿军英雄表示永远和朝鲜人民并肩反对美国侵略
    参观抗美援朝战争馆的首都军民坚决支持朝鲜人民的斗争
    据新华社24日讯　“六·二五”十周年前夕，前中国人民志愿军英雄们纷纷集会、座谈、作报告，怒斥美国强盗侵占南朝鲜，分裂和阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，加紧战争挑衅活动的罪行。他们一致表示坚决支持朝鲜人民赶走美国强盗、和平统一祖国的正义斗争。
    美国强盗侵略朝鲜、屠杀朝鲜人民的血腥罪行，和“瘟神”艾森豪威尔最近在南朝鲜的战争叫嚣，激起志愿军英雄们的无比愤怒。曾经在1950年10月就跨过鸭绿江，痛击美国侵略军的志愿军一级英雄徐恒禄说，美国强盗在朝鲜犯下滔天罪行。野兽们曾使用了飞机、大炮、细菌弹等最野蛮最残酷的手段，摧毁了朝鲜无数美丽的和平城镇，杀害了无数善良可爱的人民。从鸭绿江到南汉江，我们曾亲眼看到许多“万人坑”，埋葬着被美国强盗集体杀害的朝鲜人民。血债要用血来还！我们同朝鲜人民一起打败了美国狼。中国人民志愿军早已撤离回国，可是美国强盗还死赖在南朝鲜不走，还想杀人放火，这是绝不能容许的。著名的志愿军空军英雄吴胜凯愤怒地说，美帝国主义在南朝鲜猖狂地扩军备战，建立导弹基地和运进原子武器，破坏朝鲜停战协定。最近“瘟神”艾森豪威尔爬上南朝鲜时又大肆吹嘘侵朝美军的“力量”，叫嚷南朝鲜是“维持自由的一条极重要的边界”，并且还在停战线以南不远的地方举行挑衅性的军事检阅，这就再一次清楚地表明美帝国主义的侵略本质。我们决不允许它破坏朝鲜停战协定，决不容许它再横行霸道。
    志愿军英雄们以他们和英雄的朝鲜人民一起，共同打败美国侵略者的光辉战绩，连日在全国各地纷纷向广大群众作报告，使人们更进一步认清了美帝国主义的纸老虎原形。曾经在1951年秋参加过痛歼美国“王牌”骑一师的志愿军二级英雄高云和说，他当时带领一个班的战士坚守在临津江东岸的一座高地上，美国侵略军用大量的飞机、大炮作掩护，像狼群一样地气势汹汹地往上冲。可是我们知道他们“草包”，隔远了不理它，近了就一顿机枪、步枪、手榴弹往下排，直揍得这些美国少爷兵死的死伤的伤，活着的连滚带爬地往下逃，连伤员和武器都扔了。连续战斗五昼夜，我们班和兄弟部队一起消灭了两千多敌人。他说：“这就是美国吹嘘的‘王牌’军队，在我们手下却成了豆腐兵。”曾经率领一个高射炮连击落击伤美国飞机五十架的前志愿军连长张德新在报告会上说：美国是一个十足的“教师爷”，欺软怕硬的家伙。朝鲜战争初期，美国空中强盗真是横行霸道，猖狂极了。可是我们的高射炮一开火，它就成了“狗熊”，一架架飞机被我们打得像掉头的苍蝇一样往地下栽。参加过著名的云山战役、长津湖战役、上甘岭大捷和开城保卫战的许多前志愿军英雄，更以他们亲身的经历，描绘了美国侵略军的种种狼狈相。他们说，美国少爷兵的投降动作倒是很“正规”的：高举双手，搭拉着脑袋，跪着求饶，然后就毕恭毕敬地鞠躬敬礼，向我们投降。原志愿军一级英雄杨育才说：如果美帝国主义胆敢发动新的侵略战争，朝鲜战场上的败绩在等着它。
    英雄们坚信打败了美帝国主义的英雄的朝鲜人民一定能够取得最后胜利。原志愿军一等功臣、指导员林文贵说：“我们从朝鲜回到祖国以后，时刻都在关怀着朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。朝鲜人民的苦难，就是我们的苦难；朝鲜人民的敌人，就是我们的敌人。
    据新华社24日讯　在英雄朝鲜人民奋勇抗击美国侵略的伟大抗美战争爆发十周年前夕，中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆连日接待大批观众。这里陈列的大量历史文物，集中地暴露了美帝国主义坚持侵略、好战成性的强盗面目，广大参观者一致表示坚决支持朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略、争取和平统一祖国的正义斗争，把美国侵略者从南朝鲜赶出去，从我国领土台湾赶出去，从亚洲赶出去。
    北京帆布厂工人赵继修参观时说，十年前，震动世界的朝鲜战争就是美国战争贩子杜勒斯到朝鲜一手发动的。接着，美国侵略军又霸占了我国领土台湾。十年后的现在，美国强盗还霸占着南朝鲜和我国领土台湾，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔在最近又爬上我国领土台湾和南朝鲜进行战争阴谋活动。这充分说明，美帝国主义就是搞侵略，搞战争。这也告诉我们，对于帝国主义不应当存在不切实际的幻想，必须提高警惕，随时准备斩断侵略者的魔爪。曾经在抗美援朝战争中参加反细菌战的白衣战士卢砚东，看到陈列在馆里的侵朝美军使用过的细菌弹的弹壳和撒布的带细菌的苍蝇、跳蚤、青蛙等罪证以后，向同来参观的医务工作者愤怒揭露当年美帝国主义进行绝灭人性的细菌战的滔天罪行，她说：“美帝国主义是屠杀朝鲜人民最野蛮最残无人道的刽子手，世界爱好和平人民，都应当起来制止美国的侵略活动。”
    抗美援朝战争馆陈列的美国破坏朝鲜停战、阴谋东山再起发动侵略战争的许多照片、资料和实物，引起广大观众的高度警惕。美帝国主义片面废除了朝鲜停战协定中关于不得以增援性武器运入朝鲜的规定，却加紧武装南朝鲜傀儡军，不断派遣间谍、特务越过“三八线”，刺探军事情报，积极策划新战争。这种种罪证，已经有力地砸烂了它的“和平”招牌，赤裸裸地现出了它的豺狼凶相，世界人民都要保持高度的警惕。
    成千上万的观众看到志愿军英雄们缴获的大堆侵朝美军及帮凶军和李伪军的旗帜、帽徽、肩章、枪炮等战利品，看到美军被打得垂头丧气狼狈逃窜的照片，兴奋得拍手叫好。他们说：“对付美国强盗就要狠狠的揍！”北京轴承厂工人、民兵张家海看到美国兵害“逃跑狂”的那个熊样时说，这“足说明美国强盗不过是一只貌似强大的纸老虎。
    在参观的人群中，许多曾经志愿入朝参加抗美援朝斗争的工人、农民、机关干部、复员军人，十分关怀朝鲜人民反对美国侵略、争取和平统一祖国的斗争。他们都表示坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。（附图片）
