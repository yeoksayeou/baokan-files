    Launching a High Tide of Agricultural Scientific Research: Achieving the Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule
    Rural Communes in Guangxi Establish Agricultural Experiment Stations on a Large Scale

    (Our dispatch) In the struggle to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, commune members in rural Guangxi have universally launched a high tide of agricultural scientific research. A vigorous new situation of the masses engaging in science has emerged in the vast countryside, opening up broad avenues for large-scale agricultural production increases.

    Driven by the situation of continued great leaps forward in agricultural production, mass agricultural scientific research activities based on people's communes in Guangxi have developed vigorously. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 5,656 agricultural experiment stations (sites) at the commune and production brigade levels throughout the autonomous region. These experiment stations (sites) generally have fixed land, experimental personnel, draught animals, and agricultural implements. They include large-scale comprehensive experiment stations covering agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as experiment stations for single crops or multiple crops, in various forms. More than 600,000 commune members are participating in experimental research, accounting for about 3.4% of the region's agricultural population. At present, a mass agricultural scientific research and experiment network has been formed throughout the region.

    After the establishment of commune agricultural experiment stations, under the leadership and care of Party committees at all levels, they have played an increasingly significant role in production, becoming assistants and advisors to the commune Party committees in leading production. Since the Great Leap Forward, the great leap forward in production and insufficient technical experience have become a contradiction in rural work. Practice has proved that commune experiment stations are a very important leadership method for rural areas to solve this problem through self-reliance. Many Party committee secretaries have reflected that "having an experiment station allows the leadership to always be in an active position." Many technical problems have been solved in a timely manner through experiments at the experiment stations. Last year, the Liuwei People's Commune in Hechi County introduced a batch of Korean japonica rice. Because they had not grasped its characteristics and management work could not keep up, the seedlings grew short and yellow. Commune members lost confidence and were unwilling to apply topdressing fertilizer. Some even suggested that the commune pull out the early japonica and replant with mid-season rice. However, after the commune experiment station adopted a series of scientific measures to strengthen management, the facts negated this failed proposition. The seedlings in the experiment station quickly turned from yellow to green, and from short to strong. The commune immediately convened a meeting of all commune cadres to fully promote this experience, enabling the 1,800 mu of early japonica in the entire commune to quickly turn from bad to good and achieve a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 420 jin per mu, and a high of 800 jin. Compared to replanting with mid-season rice, the entire commune avoided a loss of at least 300,000 jin of rice. Last year, more than 2,000 mu of early rice in the Dongfeng People's Commune of Teng County suffered from rice blast, and some had withered severely. The commune experiment station studied the use of spraying *Elaeocarpus hainanensis* leaf extract and Bordeaux mixture for prevention and control, achieving good results. The commune Party committee promptly promoted these methods, thus preventing the spread of pests and diseases and ensuring a bumper harvest. Because the experiment stations provided Party committees with many scientific bases for solving important local agricultural production problems, enriched the experience of leading production, and directly promoted the development of production.

    Commune experiment stations are also bases for promoting new scientific achievements and demonstrating production increases. Since their establishment, commune experiment stations have conducted many experiments and demonstrations and promotions, such as early sowing, seedling cultivation, seedling protection, rice transplanting, fertilizer accumulation, and pest and disease control. In order to prove to all commune members the importance of fine varieties in the "Eight-Point Charter" and to achieve the use of fine varieties throughout the commune, the Yintuan Commune Experiment Station in Chongzuo County vigorously carried out the identification of fine varieties introduced from local and foreign areas throughout the year, and propagated more than 130,000 jin of fine rice varieties such as Luyu, Aizaizhan, and Shengli Xian, which are suitable for local farming conditions. They have now been distributed to various brigades for planting, achieving the use of fine varieties throughout the commune and creating good conditions for achieving a bumper harvest this year. The Qintang People's Commune Experiment Station in Guixian County conducted eight different irrigation comparison tests, proving that the use of shallow irrigation of 10-30 mm resulted in faster greening and sturdier seedlings, earlier and more tillering, stronger disease resistance, and less lodging. At present, after the promotion of shallow irrigation methods throughout the commune, many third-class seedlings have quickly been upgraded. The masses unanimously reflected that "believing in science really has methods."

    Commune experiment stations all engage in production during the day, combining production with scientific research, and at the same time stipulating a certain amount of time for learning and combining it with imparting scientific knowledge to improve cultural levels. Therefore, a large number of primary agricultural technicians with both production labor skills and a certain scientific and cultural level have been rapidly cultivated. The Chengjiao People's Commune Experiment Station in Jingxi County cultivated 587 technicians in agronomy, plant protection, and other fields in more than three months. The Qintang People's Commune Experiment Station has cultivated more than 3,000 soil fertilizer and other technical personnel for the commune in the past year, greatly strengthening the commune's technical personnel team.

    The reason why commune experiment stations can play such a significant role is mainly due to adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, with the main responsible cadres of the Party committees personally taking action and strengthening leadership. They also conscientiously implement the policy of starting from the actual needs of production and serving production, making the commune experiment stations better and better. Because they start from the actual needs of production to solve the most pressing technical problems in current agricultural production, and carry out mass scientific research activities around current production problems, they have been universally welcomed and supported by the masses, making the experiment stations constantly consolidate and move forward.

    掀起农业科学研究高潮　提前实现农业发展纲要
    广西农村公社大办农业试验场
    本报讯　广西农村人民公社社员在争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要的斗争中，普遍掀起了农业科学研究的热潮，广大农村出现了轰轰烈烈的群众办科学的新局面，为农业大增产开辟了广阔的途径。
    在农业生产继续大跃进的形势推动下，广西以人民公社为基础的群众性农业科学研究活动有了蓬勃的发展。据不完全统计，全自治区已有公社一级和生产大队一级的农业试验场（站）共达五千六百五十六个。这些试验场（站），大都有固定土地，试验人员、耕畜和农具。它既有包括农、林、牧、副、渔在内的大型综合性的试验场，也有单一作物的试验场或多种作物的试验场，形式多种多样。参加试验研究的社员有六十万人以上，占全区农业人口的3．4％左右。目前，在全区范围内一个群众性的农业科学研究试验网已经形成。
  公社农业试验场成立后，在各级党委的领导和关怀下，在生产上日益发挥显著作用，成为公社党委领导生产的助手和参谋。大跃进以来，生产的大跃进和技术经验不足成为农村工作中的一个矛盾。实践证明，公社试验场是农村自力更生解决这个问题的一个很重要的领导方法。不少党委书记都反映说：“有了试验场，使领导能够经常处于主动地位”。许多技术问题，通过试验场的试验，就及时解决了。河池县六圩人民公社在去年引进了一批朝鲜粳，由于没有摸着它的脾气，管理工作跟不上去，禾苗长得又矮又黄，社员们失掉了信心，不愿追肥，甚至有人建议公社拔掉早粳，改种中稻。但是，公社试验场采取一系列的科学措施加强管理后，用事实否定了这种失败的主张，试验场的禾苗迅速由黄转青，由矮小变成茁壮，公社立即召开全社干部会议全面推广这一经验，使全社一千八百亩早粳迅速由坏转好，并获得了丰收，平均亩产四百二十斤，高的达八百斤，比起改种中稻全社至少避免了三十万斤稻谷的损失。藤县东风人民公社去年早糙有二千多亩发生了稻热病，严重的已有枯萎现象，公社试验场研究用喷洒樢桕木叶和波尔多液进行防治，取得很好效果。公社党委及时地推广了这些办法，因而制止了病虫害的蔓延，保证了丰产。由于各试验场给党委提供了许多解决当地农业生产重要问题的科学依据，充实了领导生产的经验，直接推动了生产的发展。
    公社试验场又是推广科学新成就和作增产示范的基地。各公社试验场成立以来，都作了不少试验和示范推广，如早播、育秧、护秧、插秧、积肥、防治病虫害等等。崇左县银团公社试验场为了向全社社员证实“八字宪法”中良种的重要性，实现全社良种化，一年来，大力进行了本地和外地引进来的良种鉴定工作，并繁育了适合当地耕作条件的陆羽、矮仔占、胜利籼等水稻良种十三万多斤，现已分发给各大队种植，实现了全社良种化，为实现今年农业大丰收创造了良好的条件。贵县覃塘人民公社试验场进行了八种不同的灌溉对比试验，证明采用十—三十毫米的浅灌方法，禾苗转青快、粗壮，分蘖早又多、抗病力强，不易倒伏，目前，全社经过推广浅灌方法后，使许多三类禾苗很快就升了级，群众一致反映说：“相信科学真有办法”。
    公社试验场都是白天生产，结合生产开展科学研究，同时规定一定时间学习，并结合传授科学知识提高文化水平，因此，迅速的造就了大批既有生产劳动本领又有一定科学文化水平的初级农业技术人材。靖西县城郊人民公社试验场在三个多月中，就培养了农艺、植保等各种技术员五百八十七人。覃塘人民公社试验场一年来为公社培养出三千多名土壤肥料等技术人员，大大地壮大了公社技术人员的队伍。
  公社试验场之所以能够发挥如此显著的作用，主要是由于坚持政治挂帅，各公社党委主要负责干部亲自动手，加强领导。并认真贯彻执行从生产实际出发为生产服务的方针，使各公社试验场越办越好。由于从生产实际出发解决当前农业生产上最迫切的技术问题，围绕当前生产问题开展群众性的科学研究活动，受到群众的普遍欢迎和支持，使试验场不断巩固和向前发展。
