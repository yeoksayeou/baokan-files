Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd. The full text of Chairman Haxhi Lleshi's written speech at Beijing Airport is as follows:

    Respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi, dear comrades and friends:
    Thank you sincerely for such a warm welcome. I am very pleased that I and my accompanying comrades have this good opportunity to visit the great People's Republic of China, and I would like to extend the most sincere respect of the Albanian people to the fraternal Chinese people. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have won the respect and admiration of all peace-loving people with their heroic struggle and creative labor.
    The fraternal friendship connecting our two peoples has been forged in the just struggle for national freedom and social progress, and the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism illuminate this friendship. United as one family for common ideals and common goals, all countries are advancing confidently on the bright road opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution. On this road, leading us forward is our common and most esteemed friend - the great Soviet Union.
    The Albanian people watch the great victories of the great Chinese people with special sympathy, and watch the great selfless labor of building socialism at high speed that has been and is being carried out in your beautiful country. The achievements of the People's Republic of China on the road of socialist construction inspire the unwavering confidence of other countries that are striving for national freedom, democracy, and social progress. In a short period of time, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful country playing a very important role in the world, and has become a major factor for peace and progress in Asia and the world.
    At present, when the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism are trying to undermine peace, the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are unprecedentedly united and firmly support the correct and firm peace policy of the Soviet Union. The balance of power in the international arena has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism, and the future will belong to Lenin's immortal cause. The vicious conspiracies of imperialism are doomed to shameful failure.
    We believe that our visit to the fraternal People's Republic of China will add a new cornerstone to the solid foundation of the eternal and firm friendship between our two peoples, and will contribute to further strengthening the unity of the powerful, peaceful socialist camp.
    Long live the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    列希主席的书面讲话
    新华社2日讯　哈奇·列希主席在北京机场的书面讲话，全文如下：尊敬的刘少奇同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    衷心地感谢你们这样热情的欢迎，我非常高兴我和我的随行同志能有这个良好的机会来访问伟大的中华人民共和国，并谨向兄弟般的中国人民转致阿尔巴尼亚人民最真诚的敬意。中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，以其英勇的斗争和创造性的劳动，获得了一切爱好和平人民的尊敬和钦佩。
    联接着我们两国人民的兄弟友谊是在争取民族自由和社会进步的正义斗争中铸炼起来的，无往不胜的马克思列宁主义原则照耀着这种友谊。为了共同理想和共同目标而团结得像一个人似的我们大家庭的各国，正满怀信心地在伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的光明大道上前进。在这条道路上，领导我们前进的是我们共同的、最尊贵的朋友——伟大的苏联。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民以特别同情的心情，注视着伟大的中国人民的巨大胜利，注视着在你们美丽的国家里，曾经进行并正在进行的高速度建设社会主义的伟大的忘我劳动。中华人民共和国在社会主义建设道路上的成就鼓舞着正在争取民族自由、民主和社会进步的其他各国人民的不可动摇的信心。中华人民共和国在一个短暂的时期内，已经变为世界上起着非常重要作用的强大国家，成了亚洲和全世界和平和进步的重大因素。
    目前，当美帝国主义侵略势力力图破坏和平的时候，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国空前地团结一致，坚决支持苏联正确而坚定的和平政策。国际范畴内的力量对比，已经发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化，未来将属于列宁的不朽事业。帝国主义的恶毒阴谋是注定要遭到可耻失败的。
    我们相信：我们在兄弟的中华人民共和国的访问，将在我们两国人民永恒而牢靠的友谊的坚固基础上，添上一块新的基石，将为进一步加强强大的和平的社会主义阵营的团结作出贡献。
    伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    英雄的中国共产党及其主席毛泽东万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
