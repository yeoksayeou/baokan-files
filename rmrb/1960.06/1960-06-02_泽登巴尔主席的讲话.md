Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, June 1st – The full text of Chairman Tsedenbal's speech at Ulan Bator Airport is as follows: Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai, Respected Comrade Chen Yi, Respected Chinese Comrades, Comrades, Friends:

    Whether in terms of your extensive understanding of the lives of the Mongolian people, or in terms of the good results achieved in our sincere talks, which concluded with the signing of important documents, these days you have spent in our country have been filled with joy.

    Like the people of other socialist countries, our two peoples share a fraternal and unbreakable friendship and cooperative relationship closely linked by the common goal and shared ideology of striving to build socialism and communism. No other result is possible besides this good one.

    For your successful visit to our country, which has further enhanced and strengthened the friendly cooperation between our two peoples, and for the enormous assistance the People's Republic of China is giving to our country and will give during the upcoming five-year plan, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai, and through you, to the 650 million great Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    The power of the world socialist system and the continuous development of the cause of fraternal friendship and cooperation among the peoples of socialist countries are exerting a strong influence on the development of world history. No force in the world can create a rift in the unbreakable, rock-solid friendship of the peoples of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We assure our respected guests that the Mongolian people will continue to make every effort to consolidate and enhance the fraternal friendship and cooperation established with the great Chinese people and the heroic Soviet people, as well as with all the peoples of the socialist family.

    Thank you for the good wishes and brotherly friendship you have expressed to our people.

    On behalf of our people, our party, and our government, I wish the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government further new great victories and outstanding achievements in the cause of socialist construction in the motherland and in the struggle to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

    I wish Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai and all the accompanying Chinese comrades further great achievements in the fruitful and great cause undertaken for the happiness of the Chinese people, the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, the interests of peace, and the cause of communism. I wish you good health.

    Long live our loyal friend – the great Chinese people!

    Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples!

    Long live our powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

    I wish our honored guests a safe journey!

    新华社乌兰巴托1日电　泽登巴尔主席在乌兰巴托机场上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的周恩来同志，尊敬的陈毅同志，尊敬的中国同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    不论就你们广泛地了解蒙古人民的生活情况来说，也不论就我们举行的以签署了重要文件而结束的诚挚会谈所取得的良好结果来说，您在我们的国家度过的这些日子充满了欢乐。
    同社会主义阵营各国人民一样，我们两国人民间存在着由于为建设社会主义和共产主义而奋斗的一致目标和共同思想而紧密联系在一起的兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊与合作关系，除了这种良好的结果以外，不可能有别的结果。
    对您在我国进行的进一步增进和巩固我们两国人民友好合作的成功访问，对中华人民共和国正在给予我国的巨大援助和在今后的五年计划期间将要给予的援助，谨向尊敬的周恩来同志，并通过您向六亿五千万伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会致以衷心的谢意。
    世界社会主义体系的威力和社会主义国家人民兄弟般的友好合作事业的不断发展，对世界历史的发展起着强烈的影响。世界上没有任何一种力量能够在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的牢不可破的坚如磐石的友谊中制造裂缝。我们向尊敬的贵宾们表示，蒙古人民今后仍将为巩固与增进同伟大中国人民和英勇的苏联人民以及同社会主义大家庭全体人民建立的兄弟般的友好合作而作出全部努力。
    谢谢您向我国人民表示的良好的祝愿和兄弟的友情。
    我谨以我国人民、我国党和政府的名义，祝伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和人民政府在祖国社会主义建设事业及巩固亚洲与世界和平的斗争中进一步取得新的伟大胜利和卓越成就。
    谨祝尊敬的周恩来同志和随行的全体中国同志，在为了中国人民的幸福，我们两国人民的牢不可破的友谊、和平的利益，以及为了共产主义利益而进行的有成效的伟大事业中进一步取得巨大成就，祝你们健康。
    我们忠实的朋友——伟大的中国人民万岁！
    蒙中人民的牢不可破的永恒友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的我们强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
