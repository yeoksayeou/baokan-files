Inspiration from Underground Office Work
By a commentator of this newspaper

    In January of this year, the electric chute of a coal mining face in the Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing had its fuse blown. This very minor fault could have been dealt with quickly, but because production was underground and command was above ground, it took ninety minutes from the time the situation was reported from underground to the time repair workers were dispatched from above ground to repair it before production was restored. Recently, the same fault occurred again at the same mining face in the Yutianpu Coal Mine, but production was restored in only eighteen minutes. Why was this fault handled so quickly this time? It turns out that the Yutianpu Coal Mine is now implementing an underground office system. Each mine has established a production office underground, led by the mine director and including personnel from various command and auxiliary departments such as production scheduling, raw material supply, equipment maintenance and repair, and health care, forming a complete team working in shifts day and night. In this way, problems that used to require back-and-forth trips between the surface and underground, taking several hours to resolve, are now resolved without leaving the mine in just a few tens of minutes or even a dozen minutes.
    Underground office work is a very good method. Timely problem-solving is just one of the benefits. More importantly, underground office work makes going deep into the front lines of production a regular system. This is of great significance for us to consolidate and improve the results of our leadership style.
    The leadership method of going deep into the front lines of production has been implemented in many enterprises. A very important issue is to maintain this good leadership method for a long time. Any good leadership method, if it cannot be sustained and is instead intermittent, with a beginning but no end, cannot have much effect. Taking going deep into the front lines of production as an example, if it cannot be made regular but is instead sometimes deep and sometimes not, then although it may solve some problems, it cannot completely grasp production, because industrial production is a continuous process. Only by regularly going deep into production, rather than occasionally “going deep,” can we grasp the internal connections of production and seize the key points. At the same time, only by maintaining regular contact with the masses, rather than occasionally “contacting” them, can we become true confidants of the masses. Therefore, we must take advantage of the current excellent situation where leading cadres at all levels are going to the front lines of production to further promote the regularization of the leadership method of going deep into the front lines of production.
    To regularize the leadership method of going deep into the front lines of production, two aspects of work must be done. On the one hand, ideological work must be strengthened so that all cadres deeply realize that going deep into the front lines of production is not a leadership method that needs to be advocated only during a certain period or to solve a certain production problem, but a leadership method that needs to be adhered to at all times. On the other hand, some systems must be established to ensure the adherence and implementation of this leadership method from the perspective of systems. Currently, the whole country's rural areas are promoting the experience of the "two-five system" in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province. The "two-five system" is a good method adapted to the rural situation, establishing going deep into the front lines of production as a system to make it regular. It is clear that in the industrial field, there is also a need to establish such systems. Underground office work is a good system applicable to all underground mining operations to adhere to going deep into the front lines of production. For leading cadres in underground mining operations, going deep into the front lines of production means changing the old rule of "production underground, command above ground," so that going deep into the front lines of production is not intermittent but regular. In this way, the principle of going to the masses to lead the masses and going to production to lead production is adhered to, making leadership work more specific and detailed, and solving problems more timely and accurately.
    The implementation of the underground office system in the Yutianpu Coal Mine also gives us an important inspiration, that is, not only should leading cadres go deep into the front lines of production, but also personnel from relevant functional departments should be organized to go deep into the front lines of production. Industrial production is a complex whole composed of many links. Leading cadres must rely on the coordinated actions of many functional departments to command production. If only a few leading cadres go deep into the front lines of production, while cadres from various functional departments still squat above, then even if leading cadres discover problems when going deep into the front lines of production, they cannot solve them all on the spot. Many problems still have to be taken back to be solved. The Yutianpu Coal Mine's implementation of the underground office system, moving personnel such as production scheduling, raw material supply, and equipment maintenance and repair underground, has solved this problem very well. This experience is very important. Some comrades only pay attention to themselves going deep into the front lines of production, and do not pay attention to organizing cadres from functional departments to go deep into the front lines of production together, or only urge cadres from functional departments to go deep into the front lines of production, but do not organize them into a complete team to go deep into the front lines of production. Once a problem involving several departments is encountered, it cannot be solved. The system implemented by the Yutianpu Coal Mine of forming a team to work in the mine does not have this shortcoming.
    The underground office system is not fully applicable to factories or open-pit mines. However, the fact that this system aims to regularize the leadership method of going deep into the front lines of production and to organize a team to go deep into the front lines of production is applicable to all industrial and mining enterprises. We hope that all industrial and mining enterprises will learn from the experience of the underground office system of the Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing, create systems suitable for the specific conditions of their departments, concretize the leadership method of going deep into the front lines of production, and promote the continuous leap forward in our production and construction undertakings!

    井下办公的启示
    本报评论员
    今年1月，重庆鱼田堡煤矿有一个采煤工作面的电溜子烧坏了保险丝，这个极小的故障本来是不难迅速得到处理的，但由于是井下生产井上指挥，待井下把情况反映到井上，再由井上派检修工人下井修理，前后经过九十分钟才恢复生产。最近，还是在鱼田堡煤矿的这个采煤工作面，又发生了同样的故障，却只用了十八分钟时间就恢复了生产。为什么这一次的故障却处理得这么快呢？原来，鱼田堡煤矿现在实行了井下办公制度，各个矿井都在井下设立了生产办公室，由井长带领包括生产调度、原材料供应、设备维护检修、卫生保健等各种指挥部门和辅助部门的人员，组成一整套班子昼夜轮流值班。这样，过去常常需要井上井下往返周折，花好几个钟头才能解决的问题，现在不出矿井，只用几十分钟甚至十几分钟就解决了。
    井下办公，这个办法很好。解决问题及时，不过是好处之一。更重要的是，井下办公使深入生产第一线变成一种经常的制度。这对于我们巩固改进领导作风的成果，是具有重大意义的。
    深入生产第一线的领导方法，已在许多企业实行了，一个很重要的问题，是要把这种良好的领导方法长久地坚持下去。任何良好的领导方法，如果不能持之以恒，而是时断时续，有始无终，是不可能发生多大作用的。拿深入生产第一线来说，如果不能使之经常化，而是时而深入，时而不深入，那么，虽然也可能解决某些问题，却不可能把生产完全抓起来，因为工业生产是一个连续不断的过程，只有经常深入生产，而不是偶尔“深入”一下，才能把握住生产的内在联系，抓住要害。同时，也只有同群众保持经常的联系，而不是偶尔
  “联系”一下，才能成为群众真正的知心朋友。因此，我们要乘现在各级领导干部纷纷到生产第一线去的大好形势，进一步促使深入生产第一线的领导方法经常化。
    把深入生产第一线的领导方法经常化，要做两方面的工作。一方面是要加强思想工作，让所有的干部都深刻地认识到：深入生产第一线不是某一个时期或是解决某一个生产问题才需要提倡的领导方法，而是一个需要始终坚持的领导方法。另一方面是要立一些制度，使这种领导方法的坚持贯彻从制度上得到保证。现在，全国农村正在推行河北省吴桥县“二五制”的经验。“二五制”就是适应农村情况的、把深入生产第一线立之为制度，使之经常化的好办法。很显然，在工业方面也需要立这样一些制度。井下办公，就是适用于一切井下作业的矿山坚持深入生产第一线的好制度。在井下作业的矿山领导干部，所谓深入生产第一线，就是改变“井下生产井上指挥”的老规矩，使深入生产第一线不是时断时续，而是经常化。这样，就坚持了到群众中去领导群众，到生产中去领导生产的原则，使领导工作更加具体、更加细致，解决问题更加及时，更加准确。
    鱼田堡煤矿实行井下办公制度还给了我们一个重要的启示，这就是不仅领导干部要深入生产第一线，而且要组织有关的职能机构的人员深入生产第一线。工业生产是一个由许多环节组成的复杂的整体。领导干部要依靠许多职能机构的协同动作去指挥生产。如果只是少数领导干部深入生产第一线，各个职能机构的干部仍然蹲在上面，那么，领导干部虽然在深入生产第一线时发现了问题，也不可能一一都在现场解决，许多问题还要带回去解决。鱼田堡煤矿实行井下办公制度，把生产调度、原材料供应、设备维护检修等等人员都搬到井下去，就很好地解决了这个问题。这个经验很重要。有些同志只注意自己深入生产第一线，不注意组织职能机构的干部一起深入生产第一线，或者只是督促职能机构的干部深入生产第一线，而不是把他们组织成一个“五脏俱全”的班子深入生产第一线，一遇到涉及几个部门的问题就不能解决。鱼田堡煤矿实行的组成班子到井下办公的制度，就没有这个缺点。
    井下办公制度，对于工厂、对于露天井开采的矿山虽然不完全适用。但是，这个制度所表现的要把深入生产第一线的领导方法经常化，要组织班子深入生产第一线，却是适用于一切工矿企业部门的。我们希望一切工矿企业部门都来学习重庆市鱼田堡煤矿井下办公制度的经验，创造出适合本部门具体情况的制度，把深入生产第一线的领导方法具体化，促进我们的生产建设事业持续不断地跃进！
