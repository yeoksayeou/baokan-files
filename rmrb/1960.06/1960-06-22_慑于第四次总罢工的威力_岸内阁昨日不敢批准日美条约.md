Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st: Awed by the power of the Japanese workers' fourth general strike scheduled for tomorrow, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet meeting today did not dare make a decision to approve the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Kishi Nobusuke group originally intended to approve the new "Security Treaty" at today's cabinet meeting, then submit it to the Japanese Emperor for approval, and exchange ratification instruments of the new "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government around June 25th. Kyodo News revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke group was in such a hurry because it feared that delaying the date of the cabinet meeting's approval of the new "Security Treaty" would cause unexpected "obstacles," so it wanted to complete all the approval procedures on the Japanese side as soon as possible.

"The Nikkei" believes that the reason why the cabinet meeting did not approve the new "Security Treaty" today is that it feared adding fuel to the fire of the general strike scheduled for tomorrow; at the same time, it worried that the movement outside the Diet would create a danger of making the activities of the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party more active.

Today's cabinet meeting decided that the Japanese cabinet would approve the new "Security Treaty" after the U.S. Senate passes it.

    慑于第四次总罢工的威力
    岸内阁昨日不敢批准日美条约
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：慑于日本工人将在明天举行第四次总罢工的威力，今天的岸信介内阁会议没有敢作出批准新日美“安全条约”的决定。
    岸信介集团本想在今天的内阁会议上批准新“安全条约”，然后交给日本天皇批准，并且在6月25日左右同美国政府交换新“安全条约”的批准书，共同社透露，岸信介集团这样急急忙忙，是由于担心推迟内阁会议批准新“安全条约”的日期，会发生意想不到的“阻碍”，因此想尽早地全部办完日本方面的批准手续。
    “日本经济新闻”认为，内阁会议所以不在今天批准新“安全条约”，是害怕给预定明天举行的总罢工火上加油；同时，担心国会外部的运动有使自由民主党内“反主流派”的活动更加活跃的危险。
    今天的内阁会议决定，等美国参议院通过新“安全条约”以后，日本内阁再加以批准。
