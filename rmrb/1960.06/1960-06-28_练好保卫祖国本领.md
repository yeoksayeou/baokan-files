Sharpen Skills to Defend the Motherland
Comrade Xing Wenqiao, Representative of Militia of Government Organizations:

    We will never forget that ten years ago today—June 27, 1950—the American imperialist bandits forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan. On behalf of all the militia of the capital's government organizations, I express my boundless anger and strong protest against the monstrous crimes of the American bandits in occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan and constantly carrying out military provocations against our mainland. At the same time, we extend our highest respect to the heroic artillerymen and brave militiamen of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front who bombarded Eisenhower, the head of the American imperialist "plague god"!

    For ten years, the American aggressors have been running amok and committing all kinds of evil in Taiwan, stepping up war preparations, directly using force to obstruct our people from liberating Taiwan, and constantly carrying out military provocations against our mainland, threatening our security, and undermining Asian and world peace. Since September 1958 alone, American warships and aircraft have violated our territorial waters and airspace more than 100 times. American imperialism is so rampant in carrying out military provocations and war threats against our people, so aggressively, because the American warmongers think they have a lot of steel, huge military equipment, and atomic weapons in their hands. But what does this count for?! We believe that in world history, it is the revolutionary struggle of the people that determines the fate of mankind, not new weapons. The war intimidation of imperialism can only scare those with neurasthenia, but it can never intimidate our revolutionary people. Everyone knows that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army defeated Japanese militarism with "millet plus rifles," and the fallacies that Japanese weapons were new and invincible went bankrupt. During the War of Liberation, the People's Liberation Army wiped out the Kuomintang army armed by American imperialism and won the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, defeated the number one imperialist in the world—American imperialism—and forced it to lower its head before the Chinese and Korean people and sign the armistice agreement. All these facts fully prove that American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers that appear strong but are weak internally and can be completely defeated. Now, in the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, if American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, the end result can only be the self-destruction of imperialism.

    Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and we will never allow American imperialism to create "two Chinas," nor will we allow the conspiracy of American imperialism to permanently occupy Taiwan to succeed. We must liberate Taiwan. We will never give up until we achieve our goal! We, all the militia of the capital's government organizations, guarantee to do a good job in our work, sharpen our skills to defend the motherland, constantly heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and be ready at any time to respond to the great call of the Party and the motherland, and fight to the end against American aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace!

    练好保卫祖国本领
    机关民兵代表邢文桥同志们：
    我们大家永远不会忘记，十年前的今天——1950年6月27日，美帝国主义强盗武装侵占我国领土台湾。我代表首都机关全体民兵，对美国强盗霸占我国神圣领土台湾和不断地对我国大陆进行军事挑衅的滔天罪行，表示无比的愤怒和强烈的抗议。同时，我们向炮轰美帝国主义头子“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的福建前线人民解放军英雄的炮兵们和勇敢的民兵们，致以最崇高的敬礼！
    十年来，美国侵略者在台湾横行霸道，无恶不作，加紧备战，直接以武力阻挠我国人民解放台湾，并且不断地向我国大陆进行军事挑衅，威胁我国安全，破坏亚洲和世界和平。仅从1958年9月以来，美国军舰、飞机侵犯我国领海、领空主权的罪行已达一百多次。美帝国主义这样猖狂地对我国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，这样张牙舞爪，是因为美国的战争狂人们以为他们手里有大量的钢铁，有庞大的军事装备，还有原子武器。可是，这又算得什么呢？！我们认为，在世界历史上，决定人类命运的是人民群众的革命斗争，而不是什么新式武器。帝国主义的战争恫吓，只能吓住那些神经衰弱的人，却绝对不能吓倒我们革命的人民。谁都知道，在抗日战争时期，八路军用
  “小米加步枪”战胜了日本军国主义，那些说什么日本武器新、不可战胜的谬论破产了。在解放战争时期，人民解放军消灭了美帝国主义武装起来的国民党军队，取得了中国人民革命的伟大胜利。在抗美援朝战争中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打败了世界上天字第一号的帝国主义——美帝国主义，迫使它在中朝人民面前低下头来，在停战协定上签字画押。所有这些事实充分证明：美帝国主义和一切反动派都是外强中干的纸老虎，是完全可以战胜的。现在东风压倒西风的形势下，如果美帝国主义敢于发动侵略战争，那结局就只能是帝国主义自取灭亡。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，绝不容许美帝国主义制造“两个中国”、绝不容许美帝国主义永久霸占台湾的阴谋实现，我们一定要解放台湾。不达目的，誓不罢休！我们首都机关全体民兵，保证做好机关工作，练好保卫祖国的本领，时刻提高革命警惕，随时准备响应党和祖国的伟大号召，为反对美国侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
