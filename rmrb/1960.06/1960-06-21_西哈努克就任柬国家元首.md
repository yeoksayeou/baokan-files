Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 20th: Prince Sihanouk was sworn in today as the Cambodian Head of State at a joint session of the Cambodian National Assembly and the Royal Council, attended by government members and senior officers of the Royal Armed Forces.

In his speech, Sihanouk said that the People's Socialist Community government "will never yield to external pressure, threats, or military actions."

He announced that he would carry out reforms, especially to reduce royal expenses and stop nepotism. He also expressed that he would continue to fight against corruption.

He said that, like the late King, the Head of State would receive the people every Saturday in the presence of government members.

Sihanouk said that the Head of State would invite the Queen to continue to live in the Royal Palace "as a symbol of the royal family." Sihanouk stated that he would continue to serve as the chairman of the People's Socialist Community. He said that if he abandoned the People's Socialist Community, "national unity would be replaced by disunity and the contention of groups more or less bought by foreign powers, thus irretrievably destroying our country's peace, neutrality, and independence."

Referring to the "People's Party," Sihanouk said he had "no intention of oppressing or eliminating the opposition party."
