(News Report) The Changan Brigade of the Shizi Commune in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, at the crucial moment of the summer harvest, has been conducting in-depth ideological education on "Don't Forget Thrift in a Year of Good Harvest," ensuring foresight and careful, steady use of resources, without wasting a single grain of rice or a single penny.

This year, the yields of both wheat and barley in Changan Brigade have increased compared to last year. A small number of commune members and cadres believed that with increased production, they could eat and use more freely. Some well-to-do middle peasants went to restaurants in the county town to eat and drink extravagantly, saying, "Isn't it normal to eat and drink well in a year of good harvest? This year's income is so good, it doesn't matter if we spend a bit more." Therefore, the Party General Branch of the brigade decided, while celebrating the summer harvest, to conduct an in-depth education on "Don't Forget Thrift in a Year of Good Harvest." The vast number of cadres and commune members, based on good and bad examples and personal experiences, launched discussions, fully recognizing the benefits of thrift. Some commune members who were extravagant and wasteful also voluntarily conducted self-criticisms. The thrifty member of the Aiguo Production Team, Wang Xianren, and Yang Guotai, a member of the Tongzhuang Production Team, serve as a stark contrast. Wang Xianren deposited all of his income from 1958 into the credit cooperative. When he fell ill in April 1959, he withdrew thirty-five yuan from the credit cooperative to receive treatment at the county hospital, and he recovered in seven days. Yang Guotai's family received two hundred and seventy yuan last year. Once he had the money, he felt he could spend it freely. His son bought a new bed and mosquito net for his wedding and made seven sets of clothes, spending one hundred and eighty yuan at once. Added to this, he ate and drank extravagantly at restaurants, and in less than two months, he had spent all two hundred and seventy yuan. Through this education, everyone realized the great significance of "Don't Forget Thrift in a Year of Good Harvest." Party members and cadres have expressed their willingness to lead the commune members with their exemplary actions, ensuring that not a single grain of rice or a single penny is wasted.

In order to make the ideological education of "Don't Forget Thrift in a Year of Good Harvest" more in-depth, each branch and production team also used blackboards, local broadcasts, slogans, propaganda teams and other forms to timely commend models of thrift and criticize wasteful behavior. The idea that "thrift is glorious, and waste is shameful" has been established among the vast number of cadres and the masses.

Under the principle of ensuring that commune members are well-fed, all canteens have established plans for the economical use of grain. The Changshan Canteen of the Aiguo Production Team makes long-term plans and short-term arrangements for grain use, arranges it every three to five days, and settles accounts monthly, timely checking the grain usage. Since the summer harvest, no grain has been wasted. (Attached picture)

    丰收不忘节约　用粮细水长流
    长安大队社员用粮用钱有计划
    本报讯　安徽全椒县十字公社长安大队在夏季丰收关头，深入地开展了“丰收不忘节约”的思想教育，做到瞻前顾后，细水长流，不浪费一粒粮一文钱。
    长安大队今年的大、小麦产量都比去年增加，少数社员和干部认为增了产就可以多吃多用了。有些富裕中农跑到县城酒馆大吃大喝，还说：“哪年丰收不大吃大喝一场？今年收入这样好，多用点算不了什么。”因此，大队党总支决定在欢庆夏季丰收的同时，深入开展一次“丰收不忘节约”的教育。广大干部和社员根据好坏的典型事例，结合切身体会，展开了讨论，充分认识了节约的好处；还有一些大手大脚、铺张浪费的社员也主动进行了检查。爱国生产队一贯勤俭节约的社员王线仁与童庄生产队社员杨国太就是一个鲜明的对照。王线仁把1958年的全部收入都存到了信用部，到1959年4月份他得了病，就从信用部支取了三十五元到县医院治疗，七天就好了。杨国太去年全家分了二百七十元，钱到手后，就觉得可以大花了，儿子结婚买了新床、新帐子，做了七套衣服，一下就用掉一百八十元，再加上上酒馆大吃大喝，不到两个月就把二百七十元花光了。通过这次教育，使大家认识到“丰收不忘节约”的重大意义，党团员干部都纷纷表示要以模范行动带动社员，保证不浪费一粒粮一文钱。
    为了把“丰收不忘节约”的思想教育做得更深入，各个支部、生产队还利用黑板报、土广播、标语、宣传队等形式及时表扬节约模范，批评浪费行为。在广大干部和群众中树立了“节约光荣、浪费可耻”的思想。
    在保证社员吃饱吃好的原则下，各个食堂都订了节约用粮计划。爱国生产队长山食堂用粮作到长计划短安排，三五天安排一次，一月结一次账，及时检查用粮情况，自夏收以来没浪费过粮食。（附图片）
