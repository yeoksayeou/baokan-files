Comrades Representatives:

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the State Archives Bureau, to extend warm congratulations and high respect to the advanced units and advanced workers in socialist construction in the fields of education, culture, health, sports, and news throughout the country.

We are very excited that a group of advanced units and advanced workers in the field of archives can attend this congress of heroes of culture and education. This fact shows that China's archival work, especially the archival undertaking, has achieved vigorous development and has made significant achievements in serving China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. On behalf of the State Archives Bureau, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the advanced units and advanced workers in socialist construction in the field of archives who are attending this grand meeting, and through you, extend warm congratulations and deep respect to all archival workers who are working selflessly and diligently on the national archival work front.

At this conference, we heard the congratulatory speech made by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, Comrade Lin Feng's report, and the reports of many responsible comrades, which greatly improved our political and ideological understanding and gave us great encouragement in our work. Today, I will only give you a brief introduction to the situation of national archival work and discuss several issues in the current archival work with you.

In the past ten years, especially since the great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958, under the close leadership of the party committees at all levels and under the shining of the general line, the archival undertaking has achieved rapid development, adapting to the needs of socialist construction, and the national-scale archival undertaking has begun to take shape. At present, 1,581 county archives, 106 special district archives, 16 provincial (municipal, autonomous region) archives, 10 archives preparation institutions, and two national central archives have been established throughout the country, and some specialized archives are also under preparation. The universal establishment of national archives is an inevitable product of the cultural construction upsurge that has come with the high tide of China's economic construction.

As everyone knows, there was no archival undertaking at all in old China. The historical documents of the Qing Palace have never been given due attention and sorted out; the archival documents of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang warlords have not been centrally kept. The reactionary rulers never valued the historical culture of the motherland, and they allowed the historical archives and precious documents of the country to be lost and moldy without asking, and some even stole them for personal gain, and some sold them to the imperialists to enrich themselves. Only in the new China, under the attention and care of the Party and the People's Government, can the archival undertaking achieve such vigorous development, and many surviving historical archives and documents can have a home. The revolutionary historical documents have been cherished by the people of the whole country, and the archival documents formed by the Party and the government leading the people of the whole country in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction since the founding of the new China can be systematically preserved. From then on, these archives can play their due role in the current socialist and communist cause, and can be passed on for generations and serve the people's cause permanently.

China's archival undertaking is a part of the socialist cultural undertaking under the leadership of the Party, and like other cultural undertakings, it serves the politics of the proletariat. The task of the archives at all levels is to manage the archives inherited from history, the revolutionary historical archives formed by the Party leading the Chinese people in carrying out the long-term revolutionary struggle, and the various archives formed since the establishment of the new China as the historical and cultural wealth of the whole people, classify them according to the principle of centralized and unified management, sort them out systematically, and provide them for utilization so that they can serve the socialist cause. In addition to this basic task, the county archives also undertake the work of the archive office of the county party committee and the county people's committee, and provide professional guidance to the county's archival work.

In the past year, thanks to the broad masses of archive workers, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, implementing the policy of improving the level of archival work, actively carrying out the utilization of archival materials, and serving the socialist cause, they have played a certain role in the comprehensive and continuous leap forward of socialist construction. First of all, the archives at all levels have emphasized providing archives to serve the work of party and government leaders at all levels and the central work of the party at various times. This year, the compilation of Selected Works of Mao Zedong and the compilation of historical materials for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1959 made full use of the archival materials preserved by the archives (offices) at all levels. In the struggle against right-leaning opportunism in 1959, the archives and archive offices at all levels provided a large amount of archival materials, exposing the anti-Party activities of right-leaning opportunists and powerfully refuting the slanders of right-leaning opportunists against the Three Red Banners. In terms of economic construction, a lot of archival materials have also been provided. In the mass movement of running industry, many provincial (district) archives and many county archives have found out the distribution of many mineral deposits from old archival materials, and promptly notified the relevant departments of these materials. Many industrial and construction departments have used the archival materials of geology, hydrology, and meteorology, and design drawings preserved by the archives to save survey, design, and construction time when carrying out basic construction. Many archives have also made remarkable achievements in providing archives for cultural construction services. For example, film screenwriters Lin Shan and Qiao Yu used the revolutionary historical archives materials kept by the archive department of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, when creating film scripts such as "Party's Daughter" and "Red Boy". The historical film "Song Jingshi" used the relevant archives kept by the Ming and Qing Archives Department of the Central Archives in the process of screenwriting and shooting. Many archives also provide archives to education departments to compile local teaching materials and conduct education on revolutionary traditions. The archives have also done a lot of work in serving scientific research, especially historical scientific research. In 1959, the archives at all levels generally provided a large amount of archives for compiling history and compiling chronicles, and some also provided a lot of archival duplicates for museums and exhibition halls to display. Some archives have also used archives to compile and publish many historical materials compilations. In short, these archives have done a lot of work in providing archives for the leadership of the Party and for the socialist construction cause, and have initially shown the positive role of the archives, a new cultural undertaking institution, for the socialist cause, thus winning the welcome and support of leading comrades and working comrades in all aspects. Many county archives have become one of the close assistants of the county-level leading organs, and have been loved and valued by the county-level leading comrades.

In the past few years, although China's archival undertaking, especially the archival undertaking, has developed rapidly and achieved great achievements, this is only a beginning, and the work we have done is still far from the requirements of the Party and the socialist construction cause for us. This requires us to continue our efforts with the spirit of continuous revolution and to continue to push China's archival undertaking forward and better serve the Party's leadership and the socialist construction cause.

According to the spirit of this conference, we believe that in the field of archival undertaking, the following three tasks should be done well at present:

First, further improve the work level of the archives. For more than a year, the regular work of the archives at all levels has mainly been to provide archives and materials for the leadership of the Party, for the central work and various tasks, so in addition to doing a good job in archival work, the material work has also been done very well. Many comrades have also carried out technological innovation in the sorting and management technology of archives, and have made many valuable creations. These are encouraging and great achievements. This conference has exchanged more experiences in this regard, and we can learn from each other and improve together. The question I want to raise now is how to further improve the work level of the archives. Please consider whether we can put the task of studying the content of archives, compiling historical materials, participating in the work of compiling history and compiling chronicles, and even preparing to become the main force in compiling history and compiling chronicles in the future to an important position in the work of the county archives. As an archive material base in a region, I think it is appropriate to put forward this task. Putting forward this task will not weaken today's utilization work, but can improve the quality of today's utilization work. Measured by this standard, although some county archives have also done some work, many county archives have not done enough. Some county archives have not paid enough attention to politics in the collection work and have done too little research, and when they are used, they find that some documents are incomplete. Some archives only collect the files that people have made, and how much they send and how much they receive, without studying the contents of the files and supplementing the missing documents in time. As a result, although there is a file on this issue, it is impossible to find the important documents in it when consulting it. There are also problems in the sorting work of some archives. The quality of their files is not high, they are not easy to find, and it is not easy to conduct special research. This is the result of their unfamiliarity with the work of the organs and the lack of research on the Party's policies and the content of the files. Some comrades mechanically carry out so-called graded file establishment, and after grading, they sort according to the name of the document, resulting in the files of the same problem being sorted and scattered into many files. This is unscientific, because it is not convenient for us to study a specific problem according to the Party's guidelines and policies, and it is even difficult to find files from the file directory. For example, there are so-called central instruction files, provincial party committee instruction files, central circular notice files, and provincial party committee circular notice files. What kind of instruction, circular, or notice is it? It cannot be seen from the directory. According to the central instructions, archives should be collected, sorted, and kept with the Party's guidelines and policies as the guide. The above practice does not meet this requirement. To do a good job in archival work, we must grasp the Party's guidelines and policies in all six links; without it, we will not be able to do a good job. To grasp this guideline, we must study the Party's policies and study the content of the archives regularly. The so-called six characteristics of file establishment cannot be viewed in parallel. After dividing the years (some are divided according to the institutions), the characteristics of the problem should be highlighted to reflect how the Party's guidelines and policies are implemented in this region and in this institution. Only by collecting, sorting, and keeping archives in this way can it be more convenient for long-term use of archives and research of historical materials, and participation in the work of compiling history and compiling chronicles.

The archives above the provincial level should pay more attention to this, because it does not兼任 the work of the county party committee and the county people's committee like the county archives, and the material work for serving the current central work is much less than that of the county archives; they should use their main energy to study Party history, Party policies, and be familiar with the content of the archives in order to continuously extract treasures from historical documents and dedicate them to the Party.

Providing professional guidance and cadre training to the document archives work of the organs is a task of the county archives. All places have already done this. According to current experience, it is very convenient for the archives to check the quality of the work of the archives offices of various organs. Because we can study from the files they transferred whether their filing system is sound and whether the sorting work is scientific, so as to provide professional guidance to the work of the archives offices. In the organs where document archives personnel are frequently transferred and the document archives work is not sound, the professional guidance work is particularly important. As far as I know, the leaders of the counties and the leaders of the organs are satisfied that the county archives can provide professional guidance to the document archives work of the various organs so that their document archives work can be perfected.

Second, we should strengthen the work of scientific and technological archives. China's socialist economic construction continues to leap forward, and scientific research work is also developing vigorously. A large amount of scientific and technological materials have been accumulated in these areas, and a large part of them should be kept as archives. Some technical materials must be accumulated over the years to play a role in research work. The longer the accumulation time, the greater its scientific value, such as records of meteorology, hydrology, and earthquakes; some technical materials are necessary for basic construction in various aspects of industry and agriculture, such as geological exploration, soil survey, and surveying and mapping records; some technical materials are a tool for basic construction and manufacturing, and are also a reference for frequent design work and scientific research, such as design drawings of various buildings and various products; some technical materials are the basis for our management and use of various buildings and various equipment, which is what we call basic construction archives; there is also a kind of scientific and technological materials, that is, various scientific research reports and records, whether it is the theme or the subtitle, whether it is the positive result or the vice result, are necessary conditions for continuing to carry out scientific research; - all these archives, we collectively call them scientific and technological archives. This is the cultural wealth we have accumulated in the production struggle, and the utilization value for further developing science and technology is difficult to estimate. For example, if we do not have basic construction archives, we cannot manage a modern city well, nor can we manage a house with modern equipment well. It is even more indispensable when building, rebuilding, or expanding. In the past few years, the archives work in these areas has developed rapidly, but it cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction. Many places have therefore paid a great deal of repeated labor and delayed the development of projects or technologies. A large number of factories have been built in the wilderness to form new cities; many old cities have been rebuilt and expanded into modern new cities. To manage these modern factories and modern cities, we must establish a unified management system for basic construction archives. I hope that all modern cities can have complete basic construction archives. If small cities and rural areas carry out modern factory and mining construction, they should pay attention to this issue from the beginning, so as to avoid difficulties when they are needed.

It is the responsibility of our archives workers to often understand this situation, give some examples to the relevant parties, and draw attention to it, and provide assistance in business. Some technical archives are valued by the relevant professional departments; but the role of some technical archives is not valued by all relevant departments, and we archives workers must do more work.

Third, in terms of education in archival work and theoretical construction of archival work, major tasks are also put forward to us. The archival undertaking has developed, the archives have been spread all over China, the ranks of archives workers have been greatly expanded, in addition to professional archives workers, there are also a larger number of part-time archives workers. Most of them are content with their work, enthusiastic about archival work, and have made achievements, and a group of advanced figures have emerged. But we are still not keeping up with the needs in terms of education and theoretical construction in archival work. Since we established the archives special training class in 1952, the special training class has been expanded to the special training section, and then expanded to the historical archives department. Recently, we are also preparing to establish an archives academy. Although hundreds of archives workers with professional knowledge have been trained, at the same time, each province has also trained a group of cadres engaged in archival work, but compared with the requirements of the situation, it is still far from enough. Many problems arising in our actual work cannot be solved satisfactorily, and there are still too few archives cadres who have received considerable training.

Archival work has two aspects: on the one hand, it is a part of the organ's secretarial work, and it is an assistant to the organ's work; on the other hand, it is a part of the national cultural undertaking. Archival work has its own work object, and under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, in the practice of work, it has also produced its own theory and technology, so it is said that archival science is also a science, and this point has long been affirmed. How should we develop this science so that it can comprehensively guide our country's archival work, especially the work of the archives? This is a glorious task placed before us today. In the main points of the national archival work plan in 1960, the State Archives Bureau requires the archival work comrades across the country to conduct research on the theory of archival work and write articles. This is to require the archival workers across the country to raise the theory of archival science to a scientific height on the basis of summarizing experience, that is, to solve this problem with the power of the masses; only in this way can we train archival cadres quickly, well, and economically throughout the country.

To improve the theory of archival work and train archival cadres, all archival work cadres should regard studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Mao Zedong's works as our primary task. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. "Comrade Mao Zedong most correctly, most thoroughly, and most proficiently used dialectical materialism to solve the problems in our country's revolution and construction, and greatly enriched and developed dialectical materialism and historical materialism. This is the fundamental reason why our country's revolution and construction can continue to achieve victories." (See Comrade Lin Feng's report) The general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, these three red banners have now penetrated into the hearts of the people, and 650 million people are uniting under these three red banners and marching forward. These three red banners are the great creation of Comrade Mao Zedong. So we say that without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no victory for the Chinese revolution, no new China today, and no new China's archives. Moreover, archival work serves the politics of the proletariat and the continued development and complete victory of the Party's cause. Without strengthening the study of Mao Zedong Thought, any work will not be done well, and archival work will certainly not be done well. Our archives workers should seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and should also understand Mao Zedong Thought more deeply from the process of sorting out and using archives, and further play the role of archives and materials, and strive for the great socialist and communist cause.

    坚决贯彻全国文教群英大会精神，实现档案工作全面的更好的跃进
    ——在全国文教先进工作者代表大会档案工作系统会议上的讲话
    国家档案局局长　　曾三
    各位代表、各位同志：
    首先，请让我代表国家档案局向全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面的社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表，致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    在这个文教群英会上，能够有一批档案事业方面的先进单位和先进工作者出席，我们感到十分兴奋。这个事实表明我国的档案事业，特别是档案馆事业，已经取得了蓬勃的发展，并且在为我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务方面，作出了显著的成绩。我代表国家档案局向出席这个盛会的档案事业方面的社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者，致以热烈的祝贺，并且通过你们向全国档案工作战线上忘我劳动、辛勤工作的全体档案工作者，致热烈的祝贺和深切的敬意。
    在这次大会上，我们听到陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院所作的祝词，林枫同志的报告和许多负责同志的报告，使我们在政治、思想认识上大大地提高了，在工作上获得了极大的鼓舞。今天，我只就全国档案工作的情况向各位同志作一个简单的介绍并就目前档案工作中的几个问题和同志们一起来研究一下。
    十年来，特别是1958年社会主义建设大跃进以来，在各级党委的亲密领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，适应着社会主义建设事业的需要，档案事业获得了迅速的发展，全国规模的档案馆事业，已经开始形成。目前，全国已经建立县档案馆一千五百八十一个，专区档案馆一百零六个，省（市、自治区）档案馆十六个、档案馆筹备机构十个，全国性的中央档案馆两个，还有一些专门性的档案馆正在筹建中。全国档案馆的普遍建立，这是随着我国经济建设高潮而来的文化建设高潮的必然产物。
    大家知道，在旧中国，根本就没有档案馆事业。清故宫的历史文件，从未得到应有的重视和整理；北洋军阀和国民党军阀统治者的档案文件也没有集中保管起来。反动统治者从不重视祖国的历史文化，他们听任国家的历史档案和珍贵文献遭到散失、霉烂而不加过问，甚至有的窃为私有，有的卖给帝国主义者，肥己营私。只有在新中国，在党和人民政府的重视和关怀下，档案馆事业才能获得这样蓬勃的发展，许多残存的历史档案文献，才有个归宿。革命历史文件，都得到了全国人民的珍视，新中国成立以来党和政府领导全国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所形成的档案文件，更可以系统的保存下来。从此，这些档案都可以在当前的社会主义事业和共产主义事业中发挥它应有的作用了，并可以传之万代，永久地为人民事业服务。
    我国的档案馆事业，是党领导下的社会主义文化事业的一部分，正如同其他文化事业一样，它是为无产阶级的政治服务的。各级档案馆的任务，就是要把历史上遗留下来的档案，把党领导中国人民进行长期的革命斗争中所形成的革命历史档案，把新中国建立以来形成的各种档案，作为全民的历史文化财富，按照集中统一的原则分级管理起来，加以系统地整理，并提供利用，使它为社会主义事业服务。县档案馆除了这一基本任务以外，还担负中共县委和县人委档案室的工作，并对全县的档案工作进行业务指导。
    一年来，由于广大档案馆工作人员，在各级党委领导下，贯彻执行了提高档案工作水平，积极开展档案资料的利用工作，为社会主义事业服务的方针，因而在社会主义建设全面连续大跃进中发挥了一定的作用。首先各级档案馆都强调了提供档案为各级党政领导工作、为党在各个时期的中心工作服务。今年编辑毛泽东选集和1959年编写建国十周年史料，都充分利用了各级档案馆（室）所保存的档案材料。在1959年的反对右倾机会主义的斗争中，各级档案馆和档案室都提供了大量档案资料，揭露了右倾机会主义分子的反党活动，有力地批驳了右倾机会主义分子对三面红旗的污蔑。在经济建设方面，也都提供了不少档案资料。许多省（区）档案馆和许多县档案馆在全民办工业的运动中，就从旧的档案资料中查出了许多矿藏分布情况，并及时地将这些材料通知有关部门。许多工业、建设部门在进行基本建设时，都利用了档案馆保存的地质、水文、气象等方面的档案资料和设计图纸，节省了勘查、设计和施工时间。不少档案馆在提供档案为文化建设服务方面，也作出了显著的成绩，如电影剧作家林杉和乔羽在创作“党的女儿”和“红孩子”等电影剧本时，利用了江西瑞金县档案部门保管的革命历史档案资料，历史影片“宋景诗”在编剧、拍摄过程中都利用了中央档案馆明清档案部保管的有关档案。许多档案馆还把档案提供给教育部门编写地方教材，进行革命传统的教育。档案馆在为科学研究，特别是为历史科学研究服务方面，也作了很多工作。各级档案馆在1959年都普遍地提供了大量档案为编史修志服务，有的还提供了不少的档案复制件供给博物馆、展览馆陈列。有的档案馆还利用档案编辑出版了很多史料汇编。总之，这些档案馆在提供档案为党的领导，为社会主义建设事业服务方面，作了很多工作，初步显示了档案馆这一新兴的文化事业机构对于社会主义事业的积极作用，因而得到了各方面领导同志和工作同志的欢迎和支持，不少县档案馆已经成了县级领导机关的亲密助手之一，得到县级领导同志的喜爱和重视。
    几年来，我国的档案事业，特别是档案馆事业虽然有了迅速发展，取得了很大成绩，但这还只是一个开始，我们所做的工作距离党和社会主义建设事业对我们的要求还相差甚远。这就需要我们以不断革命的精神，继续努力，把我国的档案事业继续向前推进一步，更好地为党的领导和社会主义建设事业服务。
    根据这次大会的精神，我们认为，在档案事业方面，目前主要应该作好以下三项工作：
    第一、更进一步提高档案馆的工作水平。一年多以来，各级档案馆的经常工作，主要的就是提供档案和资料为党的领导、为中心工作和各项工作服务，因此他们除了做好档案工作以外，资料工作也做得很好。还有许多同志在档案的整理和管理技术上，进行了技术革新，有了很多可贵的创造。这些都是令人鼓舞的巨大成绩。这次大会在这方面交流的经验较多，可以互相学习，共同提高。我现在要提出的问题是怎样更进一步提高档案馆的工作水平问题。请同志们考虑一下，我们今后可否把研究档案的内容、汇编史料、参加编史修志工作以至准备在将来充当编史修志工作的主力这样一个任务放到县档案馆工作的重要地位上来。作为一个地区的档案资料基地，我认为提出这一任务是适当的。提出这个任务，不但不会削弱今天的利用工作，而且可以提高今天利用工作的质量。用这个标准来衡量，虽然有的县档案馆也作了一些工作，但是很多县档案馆是作的不够的。有些县档案馆在收集工作方面由于政治挂帅不够，研究太少，利用起来就发现有些文件不全。有些档案馆只是把人家立好的卷，送来什么收什么，送来多少收多少，而没有把卷的内容加以研究，把缺少的文件及时补上，结果虽然有了关于这个问题的卷，调阅起来却找不到其中的重要文件。有些档案馆在整理工作方面也有问题，他们的案卷质量不高，不好查找，更不便于进行专题研究，这是由于他们对机关工作不熟悉、对党的政策和案卷内容缺少研究的结果。有的同志机械地进行所谓分级立卷，并且在分级之后又根据文件的名称来整理，结果把同一问题的文件分散整理到很多卷里，这是不科学的，因为这样就不便于我们根据党的方针政策来研究某一个特定的问题，甚至从案卷目录上查文件也很困难。如有所谓中央指示卷、省委指示卷、中央通报通知卷、省委通报通知卷等，究竟是什么指示、什么通报、什么通知，从目录上看不出来。按照中央指示，档案应该以党的方针政策为纲来收集、整理和保管，上述作法就不符合这一要求。档案工作要做好，在六个环节上都要抓住党的方针政策这一条纲；离开了它，就搞不好。要抓住这一条纲，就非经常学习党的政策和研究档案内容不可。所谓立卷六个特征，是不能平列起来看的，在划分年代（有的再按机构分开）以后，应该把问题特征突出出来，才能反映党的方针政策在这一个地区在这一个机关是怎样贯彻执行的。也只有这样来收集、整理和保管档案，才能对长久利用档案和研究史料、参加编史修志工作有更大的便利。
    省以上档案馆在这方面就更加要注意了，因为它不像县档案馆一样要兼县委和县人委档案室的工作，为当前中心工作服务的资料工作比县档案馆要少得多；他们应当用主要的精力学习党史、党的政策，熟悉档案内容，才能不断地从历史文件中取出宝来献给党。
    对机关文书档案工作进行业务指导和干部训练，是县档案馆的一项任务，各地都已经这样作了，根据现在的经验，从档案馆来检查各机关档案室工作的好坏是很方便的。因为我们可以从他们移交来的案卷中间研究他们的归档制度是否健全，整理工作是否科学，从而对档案室的工作进行业务上的指导。在文书档案人员经常调动、文书档案工作还不健全的机关，业务指导工作尤为重要。据我所知，各县的领导和各机关的领导对县档案馆能够对各个机关的文书档案工作进行业务指导使他们的文书档案工作臻于完善，都是感到满意的。
    第二、应该加强科学技术档案工作。我国社会主义的经济建设持续跃进，科学研究工作也蓬勃发展，在这些方面积累起来了大量的科学技术材料，其中很大一部分是应该作为档案保存的。有些技术材料，必须长年累月地积累才能对研究工作发挥作用，积累的时间越长，它的科学价值越大，如气象、水文、地震等方面的纪录；有些技术材料，是工农业各方面进行基本建设的必要根据，如地质勘探、土壤调查、测绘等方面的纪录；有些技术材料是基建和制造的一种工具，也是经常进行设计工作和科学研究的参考，如各种建筑物和各种产品的设计图纸；有些技术材料是我们管理和使用各种建筑物和各种设备的依据，这就是我们所说的基建档案；还有一种科学技术材料，就是各种科学研究的报告和记录，不论是主题或副题，也不论是正结果或副结果，都是继续开展科学研究的必要条件；——所有这些档案，我们统称之为科学技术档案。这就是我们在生产斗争中所积累起来的文化财富，对于进一步发展科学技术的利用价值，是很难估算的。例如基建档案，我们如果没有它，我们就不能管理好一个现代化的城市，也不能管理好一幢有现代设备的房子，在修建、改建或扩建的时候，更是少不了它。几年来，这些方面的档案工作已经有了迅速的发展，但是还不能适应社会主义建设迅速发展的需要。不少地方就因此付出了极大的重复劳动，推迟了工程或技术的发展。大批的工厂在荒野上建筑起来形成了新城市；不少的旧城市改建扩建成了现代化的新城市，要管理这些现代化的工厂和现代化的城市，就必须建立基建档案的统一管理制度。我希望所有现代化的城市都能有完整的基建档案，小城市和农村如果进行现代化厂矿建设，从一开始就应该注意这个问题，免得要用的时候发生困难。
    我们档案工作者的责任，就是要经常去了解这方面的情况，举出一些实例向有关方面反映，提起注意，并在业务方面给以帮助。有些技术档案，有关专业部门是很重视的；但是有些技术档案的作用，并不是所有有关部门都已经重视了，我们档案工作者就要进行更多的工作。
    第三、在档案工作的教育方面和档案工作的理论建设方面目前也向我们提出了重大的任务。档案事业发展了，档案馆已经布遍了全中国，档案工作人员的队伍大大的扩大了，除了专业档案工作人员以外，还有数量更大的兼职档案工作人员。他们大多数安心工作，热心档案工作，也都作出了成绩，而且出现了一批先进人物。但是我们在档案工作的教育方面和理论建设方面还是赶不上需要的。我们从1952年建立档案专修班以来，由专修班扩大为专修科，再扩大为历史档案系，最近又在筹建档案学院，虽然已经培养出数百名有专业知识的档案工作人员，同时各省也培养了一批从事档案工作的干部，但是同形势的要求比较起来还是大大不够的。我们在实际工作中产生的很多问题，还不能圆满的解决，受过相当训练的档案干部还是为数太少。
    档案工作有两方面：一方面是机关秘书工作的一部分，它是机关工作的助手；另一方面是国家的文化事业的一部分。档案工作有它自己的工作对象，在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，在工作的实践中，又产生了它自己的理论和技术，所以说档案学也是一门科学，这一点是早已肯定了的。我们应该怎样把这一门科学发展起来，从而使它能够全面指导我们国家的档案工作，特别是档案馆工作呢？这是今天在我们面前摆着的一个光荣任务。国家档案局在1960年全国档案工作计划要点中要求全国档案工作同志对档案工作的理论进行研究，写出文章来，这就是要求全国档案工作人员在总结经验的基础上把档案学的理论提高到科学的高度，就是要用群众的力量来解决这个问题；也只有这么办，才能在全国范围内多快好省地培养档案干部。
    要提高档案工作理论，培养档案干部，全体档案工作干部都应当把学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，当作我们的首要任务。中国革命的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。“毛泽东同志最正确、最彻底、最熟练地运用辩证唯物论解决了我国革命和建设中的问题，并且大大地丰富和发展了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，这是我国革命和建设事业能够不断取得胜利的根本原因。”（见林枫同志报告）总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这三面红旗现在已经深入人心，六亿五千万人民正团结在这三面红旗下面大步前进，这三面大红旗就是毛泽东同志的伟大创造。所以我们
  说，没有毛泽东思想，就没有中国革命的胜利，就没有今天的新中国，也就不会产生新中国的档案。而且档案工作是为无产阶级政治服务的，是为党的事业的继续发展和彻底胜利服务的，不加强毛泽东思想的学习，会作不好任何工作，也一定作不好档案工作。我们档案工作者都应当认真地学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作，也应该从整理和利用档案的工作过程中，更深刻地来领会毛泽东思想，更进一步发挥档案和资料的作用，为伟大的社会主义和共产主义事业而奋斗。
