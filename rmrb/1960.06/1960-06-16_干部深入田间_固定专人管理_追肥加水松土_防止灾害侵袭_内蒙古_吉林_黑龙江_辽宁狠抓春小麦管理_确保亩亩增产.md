Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 14th: This year, the spring wheat planting area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has increased by about 20% compared to last year, and the vast majority of wheat fields have full, uniform, and strong seedlings. In order to ensure that the wheat successfully passes the jointing stage, farmers of all ethnic groups are intensifying weeding, watering, fertilizing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. The vast majority of wheat fields in the region have been hoed once, and a second hoeing is being rushed; more than 1.9 million mu of wheat fields have been watered, more than doubling the progress compared to the same period last year, and more than 800,000 mu have been fertilized. In the Hetao Plain, one of Inner Mongolia's famous "granaries," members of all ethnic groups, based on their experience over the years, have released water into the major canals half a month to 20 days earlier than last year to irrigate wheat. Currently, over 950,000 mu of spring wheat have been irrigated in the entire irrigation area, 930,000 mu have been hoed, and over 180,000 mu have been fertilized. After day and night efforts by members of all ethnic groups to strengthen field management, more than 1.1 million mu of wheat is growing luxuriantly.

Due to less rain and snow and higher temperatures last winter and this spring, and an early warming, wheat stem flies have been successively discovered in some wheat fields. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee has issued an emergency instruction to control wheat stem flies. Farmers of all ethnic groups are rushing to eliminate wheat stem flies, determined to eliminate them before they lay eggs and cause harm. Many regions have established insect prevention command organizations at all levels, universally organized insect situation prediction and forecasting points, and relevant units have prepared a large number of pesticides and machinery. Many communes are self-reliantly manufacturing indigenous pesticides and immediately extinguishing insect pests when they are discovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 14th: The spring wheat in Heilongjiang Province is growing very well. Large swathes of wheat fields, with a gentle breeze, stir up thousands of layers of wheat waves. People's communes and state-owned farms are now loosening the soil and applying fertilizer to wheat seedlings, and helping second- and third-class seedlings to upgrade.

Each people's commune in Acheng County has assigned dedicated personnel to manage second- and third-class seedlings. The Daling Commune in this county, with the production team as the center, has formed 42 wheat field "consultation" groups to conduct on-site "consultations" for second- and third-class seedlings and provide on-site "prescriptions." Currently, this commune has applied fertilizer a second time to second- and third-class seedlings, and more than 200 mu of second- and third-class seedlings have turned from yellow to green, catching up with first-class seedlings. Seventeen people's communes in Shuangcheng County have also universally established seedling protection covenants to carry out a mass seedling protection education campaign. Therefore, this county completed the first soil loosening and fertilizer application by the end of May, and the wheat seedlings are growing very vigorously.

This year, the spring wheat in Heilongjiang Province was almost entirely sown with mechanical and semi-mechanized agricultural implements, with a row spacing of just over two inches. In order to make the tillage tools adapt to this dense planting need, various places have, in the spirit of adapting to local conditions, transformed a large number of wheat field soil loosening tools and fertilizer application tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 14th: The spring wheat in Jilin Province was planted early, quickly, in large quantities, and well this year. Coupled with sufficient spring rain, it is growing with deep roots and lush leaves, and is currently in the tillering and jointing stages. People's communes have universally established wheat field management groups, formulated wheat field management specifications and inspection and acceptance systems, and ensured that "measures are implemented in the field and responsibilities are assigned to individuals," so that wheat field management is improved and perfected.

At present, most of the wheat fields in the province have been loosened and weeded once or twice, and some wheat fields have been fertilized and irrigated. Siping Prefecture has fertilized half of its wheat fields, and about 30% of the wheat fields have undergone a second soil loosening and weeding. All localities pay special attention to promoting the upgrading of second- and third-class seedlings. Dunhua County in the Yanbian area has adopted measures such as processing, fertilizing, and watering, and has universally upgraded the third-class seedlings, which account for about 10% of the total wheat area. In addition, all localities have also prepared a large number of pesticides and machinery for the prevention and control of wheat rust, so that they can immediately eliminate the disease once it occurs.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 14th: The spring wheat in Liaoning Province has entered the peak period of heading and jointing, and farmers in various places are stepping up tillage, fertilizer application, and irrigation. According to the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee to "make sure to plant wheat well," the wheat planting area in Liaoning this year has increased by about one time compared to last year. Generally, timely and early planting, reasonable close planting, sufficient water and manure, and the use of resistant and strong foreign varieties have been achieved. The growth of spring wheat this year far exceeds that of previous years. At present, all localities are focusing on promoting the upgrading of wheat seedlings and vigorously grasping field management. In Tai'an County, a major spring wheat producing area, more than 10,000 people participated in wheat field management, and the first hoeing and the first fertilizer application have been completed.

Leading cadres of party committees at all levels have gone deep into the fields to conduct specific leadership. The Kuangbang Commune Party Committee of Suizhong County proposed measures to fix leaders, fix plots of land, fix tasks, fix quality, fix time, fix remuneration, output, measures, labor, and leadership to the fields, which greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of cadres and members, and the wheat fields were cultivated very carefully.

In order to obtain experience in large-scale replanting of wheat fields, Liaoning Province has established 20,000 mu of replanting experimental fields in 15 wheat-producing counties such as Tai'an and Haicheng this year, using winter wheat stubble to plant rice, and spring wheat to intercrop corn, sorghum, millet, etc. At present, the spring wheat experimental fields have been intercropped.

    干部深入田间　固定专人管理　追肥加水松土　防止灾害侵袭
    内蒙古·吉林  黑龙江·辽宁狠抓春小麦管理　确保亩亩增产
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区今年春小麦播种面积比去年增加20％左右，绝大部分麦田苗全、苗齐、苗壮。各族农民为了使小麦胜利度过拔节关，正在加紧锄草、浇水、追肥、防治病虫害。全区绝大部分麦田已经锄过头遍，正在抢锄二遍；有一百九十多万亩麦田已浇过水，比去年同期进度加快一倍多，有八十多万亩已经追了肥。内蒙古著名“粮仓”之一的河套平原，各族社员根据历年来的经验，把各大干渠比去年提前半个月到二十天放水浇麦。目前全灌区已经灌溉春小麦九十五万多亩，锄麦九十三万多亩，追肥十八万多亩。经过各族社员日夜突击，加强田间管理，一百一十多万亩小麦生长得一片繁茂。
    由于去冬今春雨雪少，气温高，回暖早，有些麦田相继发现麦秆蝇。内蒙古自治区党委已经发出突击防治麦秆蝇的紧急指示。各族农民正在突击消灭麦秆蝇，决心把麦秆蝇消灭在产卵为害之前。不少地区层层建立防虫指挥机构，普遍组织虫情预测预报点，各有关单位准备了大批药械，不少公社自力更生地制造土农药，在发现虫害时立即扑灭。
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省春小麦长得很好。大片大片的麦田，微风吹动，掀起了千层麦浪。各人民公社和国营农场现在都在给麦苗松土、追肥，并且帮助二、三类苗升级。
    阿城县各人民公社都固定专人来管理二、三类苗。这个县的大岭公社，以生产队为中心，组成了四十二个麦田“会诊”小组，就地“会诊”二、三类苗，就地“出方”。目前这个公社已给二、三类苗第二次追肥，有二百多亩的二、三类苗已经由黄变绿，赶上了一类苗。双城县的十七个人民公社还普遍订立爱苗保苗公约，开展全民性的爱苗保苗教育。因此这个县在5月末就松完了一遍土，追了一次肥，麦苗长得非常茂盛。
    今年，黑龙江省的春麦几乎全部是用机械和半机械化农具平播的，行距只有二寸多一点。为了使中耕工具适应这一密植需要，各地都本着因地制宜的精神，改造了大批麦田松土工具和追肥工具。
    新华社长春14日电　吉林省今年春小麦种得早、快、多、好，加上春雨较足，都长得根深叶茂，目前正在分蘖、拔节。各人民公社已普遍成立麦田管理小组，制定麦田管理规格要求和检查验收制度，做到“措施落实到田，责任落实到人”，使麦田管理精益求精，锦上添花。
    目前全省大部分麦田已松土锄草一遍到两遍，部分麦田已经追肥、灌水。四平专区已有一半麦田追过肥，并有30％左右的麦田进行了第二遍松土和锄草。各地特别注意促进二、三类苗升级。延边地区的敦化县采取加工、加肥、加水等措施，已使占小麦总面积10％左右的三类苗普遍升级。此外，各地还准备好大批防治小麦锈病的农药农械，一旦病害发生就能立即消灭。
    据新华社沈阳14日电　辽宁省的春小麦已进入抽穗、拔节盛期，各地农民正在抓紧中耕、追肥、灌水。根据省委提出的“一定把小麦种好”的要求，辽宁各地今年小麦播种面积约比去年增加一倍，一般都做到适时早种、合理密植、水足粪饱和采用抗锈病强的外来良种。今年春小麦生育情况远远超过往年。目前，各地正以促进麦苗升级为中心，大抓田间管理。盛产春麦的台安县，有一万多人参加麦田管理，已铲趟完头遍，追完第一次肥。
    各地党委领导干部都深入田间，进行具体领导。绥中县宽邦公社党委提出定领导、定田块、定任务、定质量、定时间、定报酬和产量、措施、劳动力、领导到田的措施，大大加强了干部和社员的责任心，麦田侍弄得非常细致。
    为了取得麦田大面积复种经验，辽宁省今年在台安、海城等十五个产麦县建立了两万亩复种试验田，利用冬麦下茬栽水稻，春麦套种玉米、高粱、谷子等。现在，春麦试验田已套种完毕。（附图片）
