Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association jointly held a gathering this afternoon to warmly welcome the Japanese literary delegation headed by Noma Hiroshi.

At this gathering, attended by more than 400 people from literary and art circles, guests and hosts spoke one after another, hailing the great victory of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, and wishing the Japanese people continued efforts to persist in the struggle and achieve final victory. Many poets impromptu recited their poems, and many singers sang their new songs, expressing their lofty respect to the Japanese people standing at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism. Guests and hosts also frequently toasted the solidarity of the Chinese and Japanese people in the struggle against American imperialism.

After the gathering began, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke successively, warmly welcoming the comrades-in-arms of the Chinese literary and art circles, the heroic fighters in the Japanese anti-American patriotic struggle, and the friends of the Japanese literary delegation.

Mao Dun said in his speech: "The Chinese people and literary and art workers will always use their whole body and mind to firmly support the just anti-American patriotic struggle carried out by the Japanese people and progressive figures in the cultural and artistic circles." He said: Around the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese people have repeatedly launched increasingly large-scale national struggles. From Hokkaido to Kagoshima, from the Sea of Japan to the Pacific Ocean, the angry voices of the Japanese people have been heard everywhere. The scale and depth of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against American imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group, its tenacity and persistence, are unprecedented in Japanese history.

Mao Dun said: The surging waves of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle have educated and tempered the Japanese people, strengthened the unity of the Japanese people, and enhanced the Japanese people's confidence in winning true independence, democracy, freedom, and peace. He said: As long as the Japanese people persist in unity, persist in the anti-American patriotic united front, and persist in the struggle, they will eventually be able to defeat the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group, will certainly be able to smash the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and will certainly be able to completely drive out the forces of American imperialism from Japan. He said: "We will resolutely stand on the side of the Japanese people at all times, and final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people."

Chu Tunan said in his speech: "American imperialism is not only the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, but also the common enemy of the people of the world. The Japanese people can fully expect to receive the full support of the 650 million Chinese people in their just anti-American patriotic struggle."

People warmly welcomed the speech of Noma Hiroshi, the head of the Japanese literary delegation, with a long applause. He said that the series of welcomes he had received in China made him "very happy and grateful." He said: "We have gained so much here, and we will use it to make it a force in the struggle of the Japanese people."

Noma Hiroshi angrily condemned the upcoming visit to Japan by Eisenhower, the number one war-monger of American imperialism, as "a visit to interfere in Japan's internal affairs." He said: "The United States is blatantly interfering in internal affairs throughout Asia, and we can now see it very clearly. The anger of the Japanese people is concentrated on this matter, and the Japanese people will never let Eisenhower step into Japan." "The Japanese people believe that what he brings to Japan will be the most vicious. The Japanese people's answer to him will be: intense hatred and a more acute anti-American struggle."

Noma Hiroshi said: "The Japanese people have forged the sharpest arrow of the anti-American struggle, and that arrow is against Eisenhower and against American imperialism!" He said that the Japanese people "must take action, form a united front, and fight against the common enemy of Japan and China—American imperialism—and defeat it." "Drive the U.S. military out of Japan, establish a democratic and independent Japanese regime, and achieve genuine cooperation between Japan and China." He concluded: "We will definitely go all out and fight to the end until that day is realized!" His speech was received with extremely warm welcome.

Japanese writers Kamekawa Katsuchirō and Matsuoka Yoko also spoke. Kamekawa Katsuchirō said that the Japanese people are very angry with the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous regime, and the Japanese people are expressing their anger through strikes and demonstrations. "We hope to drive all war forces out of Japan and bury all dictatorial politics. We are fighting for national independence and democratic politics, and this is our goal." He said: "The hand of friendship extended by Chinese friends will become the youthful power of Japan and become the new song of youth in Japan." Matsuoka Yoko said: "The future of the Japanese people and the fate of the Japanese people are to be decided by the Japanese people themselves. If any force attempts to obstruct this, the angry tide of opposition from the Japanese people will become even more turbulent." She said: "We have found a common language in China, and when we return, we will be even more confident in carrying out the anti-American patriotic struggle. Our determination is unwavering."

Other members of the Japanese literary delegation, Takeuchi Minoru, Kaikō Takeshi, Ōe Kenzaburō, Shirato Sanpei, also attended the gathering.

At the gathering, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Lao She, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Ouyang Yuqian, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, and Mei Lanfang, member of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, all spoke eloquently, expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. Yang Hansheng praised the heroic fighting spirit and unwavering determination of the Japanese people. He said: "The American imperialists and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique's attempt to extinguish the flames of the Japanese people's struggle will not only fail to materialize, but in the final analysis, the flames of the Japanese people's struggle will fiercely burn and will surely burn the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to the ground." Tian Han recited a newly written poem in his speech entitled: "Roar, Japan!" The poem ends with: "Go forward, Japanese people! You are not isolated. You have the progressive people of the world as your friends, and 650 million Chinese people warmly support your battle. Roar, Japan! Japan, roar!" Lao She told Japanese friends: The people of the world support you, and you also support the people of the world. Today is the time for the Chinese and Japanese people to unite, for the people of the world to unite, to overthrow the common enemy, and to advance towards victory. We must advance unswervingly, this is the mission of our time! The hearts of the people of the world are one, and the people will surely win, this is our confidence! He shouted: "Long live the victory of the Japanese people who are united and fighting bravely! Victory! Victory!" Ouyang Yuqian said: The Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle is becoming more and more magnificent and more and more popular, giving Kishi Nobusuke and American imperialism a serious blow, and greatly encouraging the struggle of the people of all countries, especially the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, for national independence, freedom, and democracy. The Chinese literary and art circles and the people of the whole country resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people. Lü Ji said: "The Japanese people's anti-imperialist patriotic and just struggle is an important part of the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and therefore, it is unstoppable and it is bound to achieve victory!" He shouted: "Long live the victory of the Japanese people!" In his speech, Mei Lanfang raised his glass to wish the Japanese people greater victory, and wished friends in the Japanese literary and art circles to make greater contributions in the anti-imperialist struggle, and extended his respects to friends in the Japanese drama circles, wishing them victory in the struggle against American imperialism.

After the speeches, the guests and hosts dined together. Subsequently, a literary and artistic program was performed. Almost every program was full of support for the Japanese people's just struggle, expressing lofty respect for the Japanese people standing at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism. Writers Xie Bingxin, Lou Shiyi, and poet Li Ying, respectively recited their own poems: "We Welcome You with Full Passion," "Welcome You, Friends from Japan," and "Twelfth-Grade Storm." Folk poet Wang Lao Jiu composed a poem to scold American imperialism, coal miner Sun You Tian read his poem "Salute to Japanese Miners," and farmer Wu Boxiong's poem was titled "The Japanese People Are Heroes." Yuan Shuipai's poem "Group of Ugly Creatures" and Ruan Zhangjing's poem "Ode to the Storm" were also recited at the meeting. Singers sang loudly to support the just struggle of the Japanese people. Song Chengxian sang "Fight, Heroic Japanese People!" Cai Guoping sang "Drive the American Robbers Out of Japan," Xue Ming sang "Sending Remotely to Japanese Youth," and Guo Lanying sang "Eisenhower, I Ask You." These poetry recitations and singing programs received bursts of warm applause.

Koichi Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, and Hwang Bong-koo, a Korean peace activist, were also invited to participate in the gathering.

    赋诗歌颂英勇斗争　举杯互祝战斗友谊
    首都文艺界盛会欢迎日本文学家代表团
    茅盾说：中国人民用整个身心支持日本人民，最后胜利必属日本人民野间宏说：日本人民将以更加尖锐的反美斗争来回答艾森豪威尔的访问
    新华社7日讯　中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会今天下午联合举行集会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团。
    在这个有四百多名文艺界人士参加的集会上，宾主一个接着一个讲话，欢呼日本人民反美爱国斗争的伟大胜利，祝日本人民再接再厉坚持斗争取得最后胜利。许多诗人即席朗诵了他们的诗作，许多歌唱家演唱了他们的新歌曲，向站在反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的日本人民表示崇高的敬意。宾主还频频为中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义斗争中的团结干杯。
    集会开始以后，中国作家协会主席茅盾和中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南先后讲话，热情地欢迎中国文艺界的战友、日本反美爱国斗争中的英勇的战士、日本文学家代表团的朋友们。
    茅盾在讲话中表示：“中国人民和文学艺术家永远运用整个身心，坚决支持日本人民和文化艺术界进步人士所进行的反美爱国正义斗争。”他说：围绕着日美军事同盟条约，日本人民一次又一次的掀起了声势越来越大的全民性的斗争。从北海道到鹿儿岛，从日本海到太平洋，到处都吼出了日本人民愤怒的呼声。日本人民这个反对美帝国主义、反对岸信介反动集团的爱国正义斗争的宏大规模和深入程度，它的坚韧性和持久性，在日本历史上是空前的。
    茅盾说：一浪高过一浪的日本人民反美爱国正义斗争，教育和锻炼了日本人民，加强了日本人民的团结，提高了日本人民争取真正独立、民主、自由、和平的胜利信心。他说：日本人民只要坚持团结、坚持反美爱国统一战线、坚持斗争，最终一定能够击败岸信介反动集团，一定能够粉碎侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，一定能够把美帝国主义势力彻底从日本驱逐出去。他说：“我们不论在什么时候都坚决站在日本人民这一边，最后胜利必然属于日本人民。”
    楚图南在讲话中说：“美帝国主义不仅是中日两国人民的共同敌人，而且也是全世界人民的共同敌人。日本人民在反美爱国的正义斗争中，完全可以指望得到六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。”
    人们以长时间的掌声热烈欢迎日本文学家代表团团长野间宏讲话。他说，他们在中国所受到的一连串的欢迎，使他“心里很高兴，也很感谢”。他说：“我们在这里所得到的东西是这样多，我们要运用它，使它成为日本人民斗争的力量。”
    野间宏愤怒地谴责美帝国主义的头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔即将对日本的访问“是干涉日本内政的访问”。他说：“美国在亚洲各地露骨地干涉内政，现在我们看得很清楚了。日本人民的愤怒集中到这一件事情上面，日本人民决不让艾森豪威尔跨进日本一步。”“日本人民认为他带给日本的东西将是最恶毒的。日本人民给他的回答将是：强烈的憎恨和更加尖锐的反美斗争。”
    野间宏说：“日本人民造下了反美斗争的最锋利的箭头，这个箭头就是反对艾森豪威尔，反对美帝国主义！”他说，日本人民“要行动起来，结成统一战线，对日本和中国的共同敌人——美帝国主义进行斗争，把它打垮。”“把美军从日本赶出去，建立民主独立的日本政权，实现日本和中国的真正合作。”他最后说：“我们一定全力以赴，斗争到底，一直到实现这一天！”他的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    日本文学家龟井胜一郎和松冈洋子也讲了话。龟井胜一郎说，日本人民对岸信介卖国政权十分愤怒，日本人民用罢工和示威表达他们的愤怒。“我们希望把一切战争势力从日本赶出去，埋葬一切独裁的政治。我们拥护民族独立和民主政治，以此为目标正在进行斗争。”他说：“中国朋友伸出的友谊之手，将成为日本青春的力量，成为日本的新的青春之歌。”松冈洋子说：“日本人民的将来，日本人民的命运，是由日本人民自己来决定的，如果有任何力量企图阻挠，日本人民的反对怒潮就会更加汹涌澎湃起来。”她说：“我们在中国找到了共同的语言，我们回去以后，将更加信心百倍地进行反美爱国斗争。我们的决心是不可动摇的。”
    日本文学家代表团的其他成员竹内实、开高健、大江健三郎、白土吾夫也参加了集会。
    在集会上，中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙、中国戏剧家协会主席田汉、中国作家协会副主席老舍、中国戏剧家协会副主席欧阳予倩、中国音乐家协会主席吕骥和全国文联主席团委员梅兰芳，都慷慨陈词，表示坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。阳翰笙颂扬了日本人民英雄的斗志和坚定不移的决心。他说：“美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团妄图扑灭日本人民斗争火焰的妄想，不但不能实现，归根结底日本人民猛烈地燃烧起来的斗争火焰，一定会把日美反动派烧个一干二净。”田汉在讲话中朗诵了他新写的一首诗，题目是：“怒吼吧，日本！”诗的最后写道：“前进吧，日本人民！你们并不孤立，有全世界进步人民作你们的朋友，六亿五千万中国人民热烈支持你们的战斗。怒吼吧，日本！日本啊，怒吼！”老舍告诉日本朋友：世界人民支持你们，你们也支持世界人民。今天正是中日人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒共同敌人，向胜利前进的时候。我们必须百折不挠地前进，这是我们时代的使命！世界人民心一条，人民必定胜利，这是我们的信心！他高呼：“团结一致，英勇斗争的日本人民胜利！胜利！胜利！”欧阳予倩说：日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争，越来越波澜壮阔，越来越深入人心，给了岸信介和美帝国主义以严重的打击，给各国人民特别是殖民地半殖民地人民争取民族独立、自由、民主的斗争以很大鼓舞。中国文艺界和全国人民一道，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。吕骥说：“日本人民的反帝爱国正义斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的一个重要组成部分，因此，是不可阻挡的，是一定要取得胜利的！”他高呼：“日本人民胜利万岁！”梅兰芳在讲话中，举杯祝日本人民获得更大的胜利，祝日本文学艺术界的朋友们在反帝斗争中，作出更大的贡献，并遥向日本戏剧界的朋友们致意，祝他们在反对美帝国主义的斗争中获得胜利。
    讲话以后，宾主一起进餐。随后，表演了文艺节目。差不多每个节目都充满了对日本人民正义斗争的支持，表达了对站在反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的日本人民的崇高敬意。作家谢冰心、楼适夷和诗人李瑛，分别朗诵了他们自己写的诗：“我们用满腔热血来欢迎你”、“欢迎你日本的朋友”和“十二级风暴”。民间诗人王老九赋诗痛骂美帝国主义，煤矿工人孙友田读了他“向日本矿工致敬”的诗，农民吴伯雄的诗题是“日本人民是英雄”。袁水拍的诗“群丑图”和阮章竞的诗“风暴颂”也在会上朗诵。歌唱家们引颈高歌支持日本人民的正义斗争。宋承宪唱“战斗吧，英勇的日本人民！”蔡国屏唱“把美国强盗赶出日本”，薛明唱“遥寄日本青年”，郭兰英唱“艾森豪威尔，我问你”。这些诗朗诵和歌唱节目受到了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
