    The report on the promotion, consolidation, and improvement of technological innovation achievements at the Shanghai Wanguo Rubber Factory, published on page two of this newspaper on June 23, raises an important question for us regarding the promotion of new technologies and experiences: What does it mean to be a thorough promoter who advances the growth of new things?

    The numerous inventions and creations that emerge from the mass movement of technological revolution are, in most cases, still seedlings. Although they possess great vitality, they also have imperfections, and their superiority is only just beginning to show, making it difficult for people to appreciate them. At this time, whether a seedling can grow into a large tree depends on whether the enterprise leaders resolutely stand on the side of the new thing, which may appear weak on the surface but has a promising future.

    Few people verbally oppose new things, but the correct identification of new things, and then the thorough support of new things, is a problem that many people have not yet solved well. In particular, when false appearances conceal the essence, and wheat seedlings grow together with weeds, it tests whether you can truly correctly identify new things and truly thoroughly support new things. When the Wanguo Rubber Factory's coreless hose-making technology was first used in production, output plummeted and quality was low; the situation was very serious. Was it really a new thing? Did it have a future? It is not unreasonable for people to raise such doubts at this time. New things face a severe test at this time: either they die prematurely, or someone firmly supports them, unswervingly paving the way for their growth. The leading cadres of the Wanguo Rubber Factory examined the practice, repeatedly engaged in "virtual work" (务虚, meaning theoretical study and discussion), and finally chose the latter path, firmly concluding that coreless hose-making was "heading in the right direction." Why were they able to make such a conclusion? This is because when observing and analyzing this new technology, they did not dwell on superficial phenomena, nor did they waver because of its temporary shortcomings. Instead, they grasped the essence of the matter, thereby adopting an affirmative attitude towards its superiority. "Since we can produce two good ones, why can't we produce forty-eight good ones?" This firm voice from the masses, safeguarding the growth of new things, shows that the leading cadres of this factory have made a correct decision. It is correct because the ideology of the leaders who made this decision conforms to the dialectical law of the development of things, that is, recognizing that contradictions can be transformed, that the minority can become the majority, because they saw that the successful but only "four percent" of coreless hose-making represented the essence of things, represented the correct direction, and therefore dared to take an affirmative attitude towards it.

    The leader's mere affirmation of the superiority of new things does not mean that the growth of new things will go smoothly from then on. To thoroughly support new things, it is also necessary to take some new technologies and new experiences that appear problematic on the surface but are very promising in essence to the masses for discussion, listening to various different opinions, including opposing opinions. There is no need to be afraid of some opposing opinions on new things; with correct understanding and correct methods, new things cannot be opposed. It is an objective law that new things will inevitably replace old things. Technological innovation and technological revolution are the urgent demands of millions of workers, and without the active participation of the broad masses, it is impossible to consolidate, promote, and improve the achievements of the technological revolution. The practice of the Wanguo Rubber Factory proves that after affirming that the "direction is correct," earnestly mobilizing the masses to speak out, debate, and express their opinions, listening to various different opinions, fully exposing contradictions, and analyzing contradictions, it is possible to achieve consensus in understanding and find ways and means to resolve contradictions. In fact, by helping the masses see the essence of things from all aspects through speaking out, debate, analysis, and comparison, it can make those who hold correct opinions more firm and make more people adopt an affirmative attitude towards the superiority of new things. As for some different opinions, it is also very beneficial to listen to them. These opinions should also be analyzed. For example, some of them point out certain shortcomings of new things. Listening to these opinions is conducive to better efforts to correct shortcomings, thereby further enhancing the superiority of new things. Some opinions reflect misunderstandings of new things. Listening to these opinions is also conducive to conducting more meticulous and patient persuasive education work, clearing away ideological obstacles on the road to the development of new things, and conducive to the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of the technological revolution. What's wrong with that? If you can only listen to positive opinions, and dare not listen to so-called opposing opinions, if you can only listen to the opinions of the majority, and dare not listen to the opinions of the minority, it is not a truly thorough attitude of supporting new things. Because it is not conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses, it restricts the vitality of new things from being brought into play, thereby failing to promote the faster and healthier growth of new things.

    Whether you thoroughly support new things also depends on whether your love and support for new things remains merely on the verbal and written level, or whether you take active action, combining the vigorous mass movement with a down-to-earth work style. Two different attitudes will inevitably produce two different results. The experience of the Wanguo Rubber Factory has vividly proven this point. When the leadership method is only satisfied with general leadership, without doing in-depth and meticulous work, without studying the specific circumstances of promotion, without fully mobilizing the masses from the bottom up, empty slogans of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, holding a passive waiting attitude of "it will get better slowly," as a result, new things cannot get real support, and innovation projects cannot be mastered by the broad masses. Only by doing what the Wanguo Rubber Factory later did—affirming the correct direction, criticizing and overcoming passive waiting ideas, improving work style, taking active action, concentrating the rich experience of the workers, organizing the strength of all parties, and earnestly solving problems—can difficulties be overcome and new things be rapidly and gradually grown, even if the situation seems serious. Empty slogans of support without active action is a kind of wait-and-see attitude towards new things. People who hold this attitude are also not thorough and steadfast promoters.

    We would like to recommend the successful experience of the Wanguo Rubber Factory to the leaders of industrial and mining enterprises, because it has given us important inspiration on how to be a promoter who thoroughly supports new things.

### 做彻底的踏实的促进派

    做彻底的踏实的促进派
    6月23日本报第二版发表的上海万国橡胶厂推广、巩固、提高技术革新成果的报道，向我们提出了新技术、新经验推广中的一个重要问题：怎样才算推动新生事物成长壮大的彻底的促进派？
    在技术革命的群众运动中出现的许许多多发明创造，在多数的情况下，都还是一种幼苗，它虽然有强大的生命力，但它还有不够完善的地方，它的优越性还只是刚刚露出一点苗头，因而不容易受到人们的赏识。在这个时候，幼苗能不能长成大树，就要看企业的领导者，是不是坚决地站在从表面上看来还很嫩弱但是前途无量的新事物这一边。
    口头上反对新生事物的人是很少的，可是正确识别新生事物，进而彻底支持新生事物，却还是很多人都没有很好解决的问题；特别是当假象掩盖了本质，麦苗和杂草长在一起的时候，就考验你是不是真正能够正确识别新事物和真正彻底支持新生事物了。万国橡胶厂无铁芯制胶管这项新技术刚刚用于生产时，产量剧减，质量低下，情况是很严重的。它究竟是不是新生事物呢？它有没有前途呢？在这个时候，人们提出这种怀疑也不是没有道理的。新生事物在这时面临着严重的考验，它或者从此夭折，或者有人坚定地扶持它，百折不回地为它的成长开辟道路。万国橡胶厂的领导干部考查了实践，反复地务虚，最后选取了后一条道路，坚定地作出了无铁芯制胶管的“方向对头”的结论。他们为什么能做出这样的结论呢？这是因为他们在观察、分析这个新技术时，没有停留在表面现象上，没有因它暂时存在某些缺点而动摇，紧紧地抓住了事物的本质，从而对它的优越性采取了肯定的态度。“既然能够生产二根好的，为什么就一定不能生产四十八根好的”，从群众中发出的这个维护新生事物成长的坚定声音，表明这个厂的领导干部采取的是一个正确的决定。它之所以正确，是因为产生这个决定的领导者的意识形态，是符合事物发展的辩证规律的，即认识到矛盾是可以转化，少数可以变为多数，是因为看到了那个成功的但只占“百分之四”的少数无铁芯制胶管表现了事物的本质，代表了正确的方向，因而就敢于对它采取肯定的态度。
    领导者只是肯定了新事物的优越性，还不能认为新生事物的成长就此一帆风顺了。要彻底支持新生事物还必须把一些表面上看来很有问题而本质上却很有前途的新技术、新经验，拿到群众中去讨论，倾听各种不同的意见，包括反对的意见。对新事物有些反对意见，这是丝毫不用害怕的，有了正确的认识，又有了正确的方法，新事物是反对不掉的。新事物一定会代替旧事物，这是一条客观规律。技术革新和技术革命是千百万工人群众的迫切要求，没有广大群众的积极行动，技术革命成果的巩固、推广、提高是不可能实现的。万国橡胶厂的实践证明：在肯定了“方向对头”之后，认真发动群众鸣放辩论，听取各种不同意见，充分揭露矛盾，分析矛盾，才有可能取得认识上的一致，找出解决矛盾的办法和途径。其实，通过鸣放、辩论、分析、比较，从各个方面帮助群众看清事物的本质，就可以使持正确意见的人更加坚定，使更多的人对新生事物的优越性采取肯定的态度；至于一些不同意见呢，听听也有很大好处。对这些意见也要有分析，比如有的是指出了新生事物的某些缺点，听取这些意见，有利于更好地去努力改正缺点，从而进一步发挥新生事物的优越性；有的是反映了对新生事物的错误认识，听听这种意见，也有利于进行更加细致耐心的说服教育工作，扫除新生事物发展道路上的思想障碍，有利于技术革命成果的巩固、推广、提高，这又有什么不好呢？如果只能听正面意见，不敢听所谓反面意见，只能听多数人的意见，不敢听少数人的意见，也不是真正彻底支持新生事物的态度。因为它不利于动员广大群众的积极性和主动精神，限制了新生事物生命力的发挥，从而也就不能促进新生事物更快更健康地成长壮大。
    是不是彻底支持新生事物，还要看对于新生事物的爱护和支持是仅仅停留在口头上和书面上呢？还是积极行动，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动与踏踏实实的工作作风结合起来？两种不同的态度必然产生两种不同的结果。万国橡胶厂的经验就已经生动地证明了这一点。当领导方法上只满足于一般的领导，不作深入细致的工作，不研究推广中的具体情况，不自下而上地充分发动群众，空喊巩固、推广、提高，抱着“慢慢来就会好的”的消极等待态度，结果，新生事物得不到真正的扶持，革新项目也不能为广大群众所掌握。而只有像万国橡胶厂后来所做的那样，肯定正确的方向，批判和克服消极等待思想，改进作风，积极行动，集中工人群众的丰富经验，组织各个方面的力量，认真解决问题，这样，即使情况似乎严重，也有办法克服困难，促使新生事物迅速逐步成长起来。空喊支持而不积极行动，是对新生事物的一种观望态度，抱有这样态度的人，也不是彻底的、踏实的促进派。
    我们愿意向工矿企业的领导者推荐万国橡胶厂的成功经验，因为它在如何做一个彻底支持新生事物的促进派的问题上，给了我们重要的启发。
