　　Secretary Goes Deep into Canteens to Arrange Grain Conservation

　　After the summer harvest, the Party Secretary of our commune and the branch secretaries of each production team went deep into the canteens, some as cooks, and some as administrators. They helped the canteens to do a good job in planning grain use, conserving grain, and improving the living system for commune members. After specific arrangements, the canteens have had significant effects in improving the lives of commune members and saving grain. Many canteens not only provide three meals a day, with thin and thick gruel and boiled water in the morning and evening, but also provide refined grains and cooked vegetables for lunch, and care for the sick, elderly, and women in confinement. According to statistics from one hundred and fifty-two canteens in the six management areas of Beiqi, Cuikou, and Gaowan, more than 21,200 jin of grain were saved in ten days.

    书记深入食堂安排节约用粮
    夏收结束以后，我们公社党委书记和各生产队的支部书记深入到食堂，有的当了炊事员，有的担任了管理员。帮助食堂搞好计划用粮，节约用粮，改善社员生活制度。经过具体安排以后，食堂在改善社员生活和节约粮食方面有了显著的效果，许多食堂不仅作到了一天三顿饭，早晚有稀有干有开水，中午吃细粮吃熟菜对病老产妇有照顾。据北齐、崔口、高湾等六个管理区的一百五十二个食堂统计，十天内还节约粮食两万一千二百多斤。
