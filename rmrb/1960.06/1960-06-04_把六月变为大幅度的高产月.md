    Turn June into a Month of Substantial Production Increase

    The great call to "Strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year" has already been realized ahead of schedule in many factories and mines. Enterprises that have not yet achieved this goal have also experienced varying degrees of production growth after a month of hard work in May. Completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year is entirely achievable. The current task is to focus on the last month of the first half of the year—June—and work diligently and earnestly. Enterprises that have not yet completed half of the annual plan should strive to complete or exceed the target ahead of schedule this month. Enterprises that have already completed half of the annual plan ahead of schedule should continue their efforts to overproduce and overproduce again. All workers across the country must race against time, seizing every minute and second to turn June into a month of universal and substantial production growth.

    Since the beginning of this year, the overall situation on China's industrial and transportation fronts has been very good. Production has been steadily increasing in many regions and enterprises. Cumulatively from January to May, the output of major industrial products has not only greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year, but the proportion of the completed quantity in the annual plan has also exceeded that of any previous year. Turning June into a month of comprehensive and substantial production growth, especially for raw materials and fuels such as steel, iron, coal, and ore, will not only ensure the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year but also directly prepare more favorable conditions for increasing production in the second half of the year, enabling a better-than-expected completion of the annual plan in the second half. In this way, we can break the so-called "usual pattern" of "high in the fourth quarter and low in the first quarter" after breaking the so-called "usual pattern" of "relaxed in the first half of the year and tight in the second half of the year" in the first quarter, thereby further establishing a new normal of stable and rising production, one wave higher than the other.

    The conditions for a substantial increase in production in June are very good. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on the "four modernizations," is advancing along a correct, scientific, and mass-based path. Workers in all walks of life have created many effective new experiences and technologies, opening up broad avenues for further tapping production potential. The masses of workers in all trades and industries are in high spirits, with high awareness, good style, and soaring enthusiasm. Production preparation work such as raw materials, material and fuel supply, and equipment maintenance in many enterprises has been greatly improved and strengthened in May. Due to the successive commissioning of newly built key enterprises and batches of small-scale modern and indigenous enterprises, the production capacity of various industries has increased to varying degrees. As long as leaders at all levels grasp production firmly, closely, and specifically, promote a realistic approach, and launch mass movements on a large scale, a substantial increase in production can surely be rapidly turned into reality.

    Grasping means first grasping ideology. Under certain material and technical conditions, whether production can increase substantially or not, people's mental state and ideological conditions often play a decisive role. Many enterprises have continuously and significantly increased production because cadres and the masses have never been complacent or relaxed in their thinking, resulting in the early achievement of the goal of completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year. Grasping ideology means continuing to promote the spirit of continuous revolution with diligence and steadfastness, constantly guarding against and preventing complacency and relaxation, and continuously leaping forward again and again. When encountering difficulties in production, it is necessary to be vigilant against and prevent fear of difficulties, to face up to objective difficulties, and to try every means to overcome these difficulties, rather than being overwhelmed by objective difficulties and relaxing one's subjective efforts. We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, seeing both the favorable and positive aspects and the unfavorable and negative aspects, promoting the favorable and positive aspects and overcoming the unfavorable and negative aspects. Only in this way can we always stand at the forefront of the mass movement and lead the masses forward without missing opportunities.

    The second thing to grasp is to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in depth, boldly create, and at the same time, vigorously promote those new experiences and technologies that have been effective for production, and apply these new technologies and new experiences to production quickly and widely, and adhere to them and consolidate them. At present, there are many effective new technologies and new experiences created in all walks of life, which are sharp weapons for improving labor efficiency. As long as we quickly and universally promote these new technologies and new experiences in the same type of work and in the same industry, the production of the entire enterprise and the entire department can increase substantially. The process of promoting new technologies and new experiences is also a process of ideological struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the conservative. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out meticulous political and ideological work to eliminate various ideological obstacles. Otherwise, new technologies and new experiences will not be promoted. In addition to this, it is also necessary to carry out specific organizational work, and all management systems that are not compatible with the development of the current technological revolution and the development of productive forces, such as planned quotas, labor organization, rules and regulations, etc., must be improved and adjusted in a timely manner. In this way, conditions can be created from all aspects for the wide application of new technologies and new experiences, thereby promoting a substantial increase in production.

    The third thing to grasp is to rationally use equipment, materials, manpower, and transportation tools, and use them where they are most urgently needed. Our construction must be carried out according to the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard, in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner, and we must concentrate our efforts to complete one batch before starting another. Therefore, at any time, the use of our manpower, material resources, and resources must be prioritized according to the "one, two, three" principle. The "one" referred to here refers to national planning projects, "two" refers to the planning projects of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and "three" refers to the planning projects below the prefecture and county level. Arranging according to the "one, two, three" principle is to implement the principle of the whole country as one chessboard, prioritizing the national level over the local level and prioritizing what is within the plan over what is outside the plan. At present, the allocation of equipment, materials, labor, and transportation forces must first guarantee the need for a substantial increase in the production and transportation of coal, iron, and ore. Coal, iron, ore, and transportation are the key areas that must be further strengthened in current industrial production and construction. Only by concentrating our efforts to meet their needs can we better promote the comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economy.

    The party organizations of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have been grasping industrial production and construction very closely, and regularly supervising and inspecting, which is the greatest guarantee for a substantial increase in production in June. The problem now is that the leadership of economic departments at all levels and the leadership of enterprises must keep up with the development of the objective situation. Leading comrades should hold as few meetings as possible and spend more time going deep into the production site and among the masses to understand and analyze the situation specifically, solve ideological problems if there are ideological problems, solve practical problems if there are practical problems, and solve whatever problems there are. We must be sure to solve problems practically and grasp measures practically. We must achieve ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point enthusiasm. The current targets are advanced, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers is also very high, but if the measures are not twelve points, but only eleven points, ten points, or even only nine points or eight points, then production cannot increase substantially. Our slogan is: "Grasp fiercely, specifically, meticulously, and comprehensively." Not only grasp output and progress, but also grasp quality, cost, and safety; not only grasp ideology and production, but also grasp life; not only grasp June, but also grasp the production preparations for the third quarter. The more output increases substantially, the more attention should be paid to grasping quality and safety, the more attention should be paid to reasonably arranging the life and rest of workers, and the more attention should be paid to arranging the next step of production preparation work. Summer has arrived, and attention should be paid to preventing heatstroke, rain, floods, high temperatures, and typhoons, building roads, and storing necessary raw materials, which is extremely important for ensuring a substantial increase in production in June, and for ensuring a sustained leap forward in the third quarter and in the future.

    In short, the current situation and subjective and objective conditions are very good. As long as we continue to exert great effort, prevent relaxation, leading comrades go deep into the forefront of production, promote a realistic approach, and practically arrange specific measures to ensure a substantial increase in production, a new production upsurge will come. Turning June into a month of substantial production growth and striving to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year is definitely achievable.

    把六月变为大幅度的高产月
    “力争上半年完成全年计划的一半”的伟大号召，在许多厂矿企业里，已经提前实现了。还没有实现的企业，经过5月份一个月的奋战，生产也有了不同程度的增长。上半年完成全年计划的一半，是完全能够实现的。现在的任务是，狠抓上半年最后一个月——6月份，扎扎实实地大干一番。还没有完成全年计划的一半的企业，要在这个月里，力争提前或者超额完成任务；已经提前完成全年计划的一半的企业，也要再接再厉，力争超产再超产。全国的职工同志们必须赶前不赶后，争分夺秒，把6月变为生产普遍大幅度增长的一个月。
    今年以来，我国工业、交通运输战线上总的形势是很好的。许多地方和许多企业的生产都节节上升。1—5月份累计，主要工业产品产量不仅大大超过了去年同期的水平，而且完成数量在全年计划中所占的比重，也超过已往任何一年。把6月份变为生产全面大幅度增长，特别是钢、铁、煤、矿石等原料和燃料生产大幅度增长的一个月，这就不但可以保证上半年完成全年计划的一半，而且也直接为下半年增加生产准备了更加有利的条件，使下半年更好地超额完成全年计划。这样，我们就有可能继第一季度打破所谓“四季度高，一季度低”的“常规”之后，再打破所谓“上半年松，下半年紧”的“常规”，从而进一步树立生产稳定上升、一浪高过一浪的新常规。
    6月份生产大幅度增长的条件非常好。以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，正在沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道前进。各行各业的职工都创造了许多行之有效的新经验、新技术，为进一步挖掘生产潜力开辟了宽阔的道路。各行各业的职工群众意气风发，觉悟高，风格好，干劲冲天。许多企业的原料、材料和燃料供应、设备维修等生产准备工作，在5月都有了很大的改进和加强。由于新建的重点企业和成批的小洋群、小土群企业的陆续投入生产，各行各业的生产能力都有不同程度的增加。只要各级领导对生产抓得狠、抓得紧、抓得具体，发扬实事求是的作风，大搞群众运动，就一定能够把生产大幅度增长迅速地变为现实。
    抓，首先是抓思想。在一定的物质技术条件下，生产能不能大幅度地增长，人们的精神状态、思想状况常常起决定性的作用。许多企业由于干部和群众在思想上自始至终地不自满、不松懈，生产不断显著地增长，结果提前达到了上半年完成全年计划一半的目标。抓思想，就是要继续发扬兢兢业业、踏踏实实的不断革命的精神，时刻警惕和防止自满松劲情绪，不断地跃进再跃进。在生产遇到了一些困难的时候，则要警惕和防止畏难情绪，要正视客观困难，并且千方百计地去克服这些困难，而不应当被客观困难压倒，放松自己主观的努力。我们要学会全面看问题，既要看到有利的和积极的一面，又要看到不利的和消极的一面，发扬有利的积极的东西，克服不利的消极的东西。这样才能时刻站在群众运动的前面，不失时机地领导群众前进。
    第二个要抓的，就是针对当前生产薄弱环节和关键问题，深入地开展技术革新、技术革命，大胆创造，同时，要狠狠地推广那些对生产已经行之有效的新经验、新技术，要把这些新技术、新经验迅速地广泛地应用到生产中去，并且坚持下去，巩固下去。现在各行各业创造的行之有效的新技术、新经验很多，它们都是提高劳动效率的犀利武器。只要我们迅速地使这些新技术、新经验，在同工种、同行业中普遍推广，那么，整个企业、整个部门的生产就能大幅度地增长。新技术、新经验的推广过程，也是一个新与旧、先进与保守的思想斗争过程，因此，必须进行细致的政治思想工作，扫除各种思想障碍。否则，新技术、新经验就推广不起来。除此以外，还要进行具体的组织工作，凡是与当前技术革命的发展、生产力的发展不相适应的各种管理制度，如计划定额、劳动组织、规章制度等都要作及时地改进和调整。这样，才能从各个方面为新技术、新经验的广泛应用创造条件，从而促进生产的大幅度增长。
    第三个要抓的，就是要合理地使用设备、材料、人力和运输工具，把它们用到最迫切需要的地方去。我们的建设必须根据全国一盘棋的精神，有计划、有步骤、有重点地进行，必须集中力量干完一批再干一批。因此，不论在什么时候，我们的人力、物力，资源的使用，都要分别轻重缓急，按照“一、二、三”原则排队。这里所讲的“一”，是指国家计划项目，“二”是指省、市、自治区的计划项目，“三”是指专、县以下的计划项目。按照“一、二、三”原则排队，就是贯彻先国家后地方、先计划内后计划外的全国一盘棋的原则。在当前，设备、材料、劳动力和运输力量的分配，首先是保证煤、铁、矿石生产和运输量大幅度增长的需要。煤、铁、矿石和运输，是现在工业生产和建设中必须进一步加强的重点，只有集中力量满足它们的需要，才能更好地推动整个国民经济的全面跃进。
    各省、市、自治区党组织对工业生产和建设抓得很紧，经常督促和检查，这是6月份生产大幅度增长的最大保证。现在的问题是，各级经济领导部门和企业的领导工作，要跟上客观形势的发展。领导同志要尽量少开会，要抽出更多的时间深入到生产现场中去，到群众中去，具体地了解和分析情况，有思想问题就解决思想问题，有实际问题就解决实际具体问题，有什么问题就解决什么问题。一定要切切实实地解决问题，切切实实地抓措施。我们要做到十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲。现在的指标是先进的，广大职工群众的干劲也是很足的，但如果措施没有十二分，而只有十一分、十分，甚至只有九分、八分，那么生产也是不能大幅度地增长的。我们的口号是：“要狠狠地、具体地、细致地抓，全面地抓。”不仅抓产量和进度，还要抓质量、成本和安全；不仅抓思想和生产，还要抓生活；不仅抓6月份，还要抓第三季度的生产准备。越是产量大幅度增长的时候，越要注意抓质量和安全，越要注意合理安排职工的生活和休息，越要注意安排下一步的生产准备工作。夏季已经到来，应当注意防暑、防雨、防洪、防高温、防台风，修筑道路，储备必要的原料材料，这对于保证6月份生产大幅度增长，对于保证第三季度以及今后持续的跃进，都是极其重要的。
    总之，当前形势和主观客观条件都很好，只要我们继续大鼓干劲，防止松劲，领导同志深入生产第一线，发扬实事求是的作风，切实安排好保证生产大幅度增长的具体措施，新的生产高潮就会到来。把6月份变为生产大幅度增长的月份，争取上半年完成全年计划的一半，是一定能够办得到的。
