    Our Beloved "Children's Home"
    Liang Guizhen, Representative of the "Children's Home" in Beiliu County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

    I am the representative of the "Children's Home" in Beiliu County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Before 1955, after school in Beiliu County, some of the children went home to help with housework, while others had nothing to do and wandered around. Some kicked footballs and rolled iron hoops in the streets, and some fought with each other. Children who didn't go to school also ran around and made noise, disrupting traffic. Some bad elements in the streets lured some of our children to steal things, smoke, gamble, read bad books, and use vulgar language. As a result, some children followed suit, not studying hard in school and making trouble after school. In addition, some children felt that the activities in school could not fully meet their needs and wanted to engage in some activities in their spare time and during vacations, but they did not have a public place to do so, so they had to find a place to do it secretly. Once, they stole a magic lantern lens from a theatrical troupe and hid in a room to make some kind of "instrument." Another time, they secretly cut off the tails of the People's Liberation Army uncles' horses to make erhus. Also, small pieces of cloth, iron wire, and small tools often disappeared from the homes of many children. After investigation, it was discovered that they had taken them to make some products. The public security police station felt a little troubled by these children and had to gather them every once in a while to educate them and notify the schools and the children's parents to "discipline" them properly. Sometimes the schools punished them for these behaviors, and their parents also beat and scolded them and forbade them from going out, but the problem was still not solved.

    Our dear Party cares most about us children. After the Beiliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party learned about this matter, it believed that we should not only blame our children but should also provide us children with a place to engage in activities after school, so that we could receive communist education well and study, work, and live well. Therefore, the County Committee proposed the establishment of a "Children's Home."

    Building the "Children's Home" with Our Own Hands

    There are more than 3,000 children between the ages of six and fifteen in Beiliu County. When the County Committee proposed the establishment of the "Children's Home," some people believed that so many people participating in activities would require the government to allocate a lot of money to build large houses and purchase a large number of supplies. However, the County Committee did not agree with this view and clearly stated that it should be done: "Build a home frugally, build a home through labor, and let the masses run the home." Secretary Pang of the County Committee personally took charge and served as the director of the preparatory committee for building the "home." He convened a meeting of cadres from government agencies, publicized the benefits of building the "home," and called on all government agencies and units to vigorously support the "Children's Home" by donating books, paintings, desks, chairs, various supplies, and toys. Under the care of the Party and with the strong support of all parties, the "Children's Home" was established on New Year's Day in 1956.

    The address of the "Children's Home" was a dilapidated temple. Besides a few empty rooms, there was nothing else. Although the government supported us and the masses donated many gifts, it still could not meet our needs. The County Committee instructed us to build the "home" with our own children's labor. The County Committee of the Communist Youth League, in accordance with the Party's instructions, mobilized more than 50,000 children throughout the county to support the "Children's Home." The children brought more than 90,000 jin of rice that they had picked up. Several primary schools in the county also mobilized more than 3,000 students to participate in the construction of the "home," moving 110 cubic meters of yellow mud, 200 cubic meters of river sand, collecting more than 40,000 old bricks, leveling 20 cubic meters of land, painting all the walls, and building a skating rink and an open-air dance floor. After more than a month of hard work, the construction was finally completed, and a desolate ancient temple was transformed into a children's paradise.

    In front of the "Children's Home" is a beautiful Gui River. Every year when spring is warm and flowers bloom, the children go to the river to play. How much we wanted to go boating in the middle of the river and learn the brave spirit of the naval uncles! The children proposed to establish a "Red Young Pioneers Shipyard." The children elected the son of a carpenter as the factory director, and more than 160 young workers participated in the shipbuilding work. Under the guidance of the worker uncles, they made 31 small boats in one summer vacation. When we rowed the small boats we made with our own hands, we were so happy! We thought we were just like the brave little navy defending the motherland.

    In order to enrich the activities of the "Children's Home," we also made various models, utensils, and toys; when they were broken, we repaired them ourselves. We did everything we could do ourselves, without wasting a penny of the country's money.

    Rich and Colorful Activities

    After our "Children's Home" was established, how should we carry out activities? Those who were older and had more knowledge loved to engage in creation, so they participated in electrical, chemical, meteorological, and agricultural experiment groups. The sisters who liked to sew clothes and embroider joined sewing and embroidery groups. Others participated in singing, dancing, skating, ball games, and other activities according to their own interests. Our "Children's Home" has organized more than 70 professional groups, with more than 1,300 children participating. The younger brothers and sisters, who did not participate in professional groups, learned to read by looking at pictures, made clay figures, raised white rabbits, and did various interesting labor and games.

    Last year, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed to the people of the whole country: Oppose Rightism, Defend the Three Red Banners. The "Children's Home" cooperated with the school to conduct education for the children on "Long Live the Three Red Banners." We invited an uncle who had just returned from a meeting in Beijing to introduce to the children the achievements of the motherland's construction. When he talked about the construction of the Great Hall of the People, the children jumped up with joy. After listening to the report, we knew that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune were really good. We also went to the commune to visit and saw that the commune's production and life were all good, and we received a great education. One child said: "In the past, I didn't love the People's Commune enough. I thought the public canteen was not free. After visiting the commune, I saw that the commune's production was so good and the pigs were so big. How much I love the commune!"

    Last summer vacation, we organized a ten-minute train trip. We took the train from Yulin to Rendong, which was exactly ten minutes. It was the first time for everyone to take the train, and everything we saw and heard on the train was new, and we learned a lot of knowledge. When we were talking enthusiastically, ten minutes passed, and we arrived at the station and got off the train. When we walked back, the weather was very hot, and the fifteen li of road took two hours, making everyone sweat all over. The counselor then said to us, what are your thoughts on this trip? Everyone said that it only took ten minutes to take the train, but it took two hours to walk back. The power of the train is really great! Little friend Zhang Bize said: "Developing heavy industry will provide steel to build railways. We must vigorously support heavy industry and realize industrialization as soon as possible."

    We also carried out the activities of "planting trees and afforestation, eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and speaking Mandarin" very well. In 1958, we opened a juvenile orchard of eight mu. This year, in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, more than 2,000 of our children spent two days planting more than 14,000 castor bean plants and more than 3,500 pigeon pea plants.

    Since the establishment of the "home" in 1956, with the help of uncles and aunts, we have established more than 20 small factories, made 25 kinds of products, experimented with radio transmitters, automatic lathes, granular fertilizers, rayon, and some other things that we can do. Little friend Yang Wencheng, who participated in the electrician group, is thirteen years old this year. Under the guidance of the uncles at the broadcasting station, he learned to make crystal radios, assemble and disassemble radios, and worked with the little friends in the electrician group to make wireless telegraphs, electric pens, electric motors, etc. Once, the loudspeaker of the construction engineering team was broken and was sent to the electrician group of the "Children's Home" for repair. The juvenile agricultural experiment station, in cooperation with the school's agricultural class, carried out 14 kinds of agricultural experiments, such as sexual and asexual hybridization and variety improvement, and the results of improving corn varieties were also very good.

    Our "Children's Home" happily holds sports competitions and art competitions during festivals, and often holds evening parties on Saturdays. When Li Yamei and other actors from the Young Pioneers dance troupe were raising white rabbits, they paid close attention to the living habits and movements of the white rabbits and created a very educational "White Rabbit Dance." Last year, under the guidance of counselors and teachers, our dance troupe created more than 30 programs such as "Seed Collection Dance" and "Deep Plowing Dance," of which "Seed Collection Dance" also won the first prize in the county's literary and artistic performance. The secretary of the County Committee loves to watch our programs very much and often comes to participate in our evening parties. Now, three actors from our dance troupe have been admitted to the juvenile class of the Guangxi Academy of Arts, one has been recommended to the prefectural cultural troupe, and three have been recommended to the county cultural troupe.

    The library of our "Children's Home" has 120,000 books and is open every day. The juvenile photography studio allows you to take photos yourself and develop photos. It only costs three cents to develop a photo. We show slides ourselves at every evening party, without charging money, and we also "enter with tickets." Our projection technology is so good, the narrators are children themselves, and the seats are very close to the screen, so it is very clear to see and hear. The children love to watch it, and it is always full every time it is shown. I remember once, a child bought a movie ticket, and later learned that the "Children's Home" was also showing slides, so he returned the movie ticket and ran to watch his own slides.

    Through these activities, the children's communist consciousness has been greatly improved. We love labor, and we also love working people, love the collective, and love public property. In recent years, no one has been found stealing things in the "Children's Home." Last year, the children picked up 120 items and returned them to their original owners. In the past two years, 28 children who used to be mischievous, lazy, and stealing things have now become good children. Little friend Lu Jiarui used to steal things. After participating in the activities of the "Children's Home," his thinking has improved. Last year, he picked up more than eleven yuan and automatically returned it to the original owner. The children respect the worker uncles and farmer uncles very much and help the street sweepers sweep the streets and help the farmer uncles push wooden carts. This is a common occurrence. Since last year, the sewing group has sewn and mended more than 320 pieces of clothing for the children.

    The activities of our "Children's Home" are closely integrated with the Party's central work and school education, so the Party Committee is satisfied, the parents are satisfied, and the children are also satisfied. The principal of Lingcheng Primary School said: "The 'Children's Home' is the second classroom for the students." Teachers from all schools welcome their students to participate in the activities of the Children's Home. Little friend Li Zhongyi said: "I always feel uneasy if I don't go to the Children's Home for a day." A teacher from Lingcheng Primary School went to Mo Changping's home to look for him. His mother said: "If you want to find my son, you don't need to go anywhere else. You will definitely see him at the 'Children's Home.'"

    Learning to Manage Ourselves

    Every day, five or six hundred children participate in the activities of our "Children's Home," and sometimes there are more than a thousand people. How do we lead so many children? We only have two full-time counselors, one of whom often goes to the countryside to participate in central work. How can the remaining counselor manage so many of us? The Party teaches us: We must learn to manage ourselves. After the "Children's Home" was established, everyone discussed: "How can we run the 'home' well?" Little friend Liang Shiquan said: "The 'Children's Home' was established by the Communist Party leading us with labor. We must run it well." Everyone said: "We must love our home and work for our home." Then we organized the "home" management committee, and the best children were selected to serve as group leaders of each group. Hu Chengqing, the leader of the sewing group, her family is in sewing, Zhang Guangchao, the director of the shipyard, his family is in woodworking, Cao Youquan, the leader of the barber group, his father is a barber worker, and the other group leaders are the same. These children are all good in ideology, study, and work, and most of them are team leaders and class leaders. When we have difficulties in our activities, we ask the uncles and aunts of the relevant units to help solve them. We often receive guidance from the broadcasting station, agricultural experiment station, farm, county cultural troupe, and other units.

    In order to carry out the activities well, more than a dozen children serve as duty officers every day. Their job is to manage toys, lend out books, maintain discipline, and manage cleaning and hygiene. Our duty officers are very responsible in their work. Last year, the children of Lingcheng Primary School went to see the movie "Lanlan and Dongdong." While everyone was enjoying the movie, little friend Chen Jianjun suddenly ran to the homeroom teacher and said: "Teacher, I don't want to watch it anymore. I want to go back." The teacher said: "Watch it first and then go back. I will send you home." Chen Jianjun said: "No, I am going back to the 'Children's Home.' Today is my duty day." After the teacher agreed, he ran to the "Children's Home." Recently, a mass meeting was held in front of the "Children's Home." Many people came to the "Children's Home" to borrow benches to sit on. The duty officers waited until the meeting was over late at night before moving all the remaining benches from the venue back to the "Children's Home" before going back to sleep.

    Uncles and aunts, we have only made such a small amount of achievements, but the Party and the Communist Youth League have given us great encouragement. Uncle Hu Yaobang, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, came to our "Children's Home" the year before last, gave us many important instructions, and also gave us radios and many books. The Central Newsreel Film Studio also came to our "Children's Home" to make a movie. Uncles and aunts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also gave us many valuable gifts. This has given us great encouragement.

    In the future, we will continue to listen to the Party's words well, continue to go all out, and run the "Children's Home" even better. We very much hope that the representatives of the uncles, aunts, and uncles will visit and guide our "Children's Home."

    我们心爱的“少年之家”
    广西僮族自治区北流县“少年之家”代表　梁桂珍
    我是广西僮族自治区北流县“少年之家”的代表。1955年以前，我们北流县县城里上学的小朋友放学以后，有的回家帮助家里做工作，有的没有事做，到处游荡，有的在街上踢皮球、滚铁环，有的在一起打架，没有上学的小朋友，也跟着乱跑乱闹，弄得街上乱嘈嘈的，妨碍交通。街上的一些坏分子，引诱我们的一些小朋友去偷东西、抽烟、赌博、看坏书、讲下流话。这样，有些小朋友就跟着学坏了，在学校不好好地学习，出学校就会捣乱。另外，还有一些小朋友，感到校内活动不能完全满足自己的要求，想在课余和假期搞一些活动，可是没有一个公开活动的场所，只得自己找个地方偷偷地干。有一次，他们偷了一个剧团的幻灯镜头，躲到一间房子里搞什么“仪器”；还有一次，解放军叔叔的马，也被他们偷偷地割掉马尾毛来做二胡；还有不少小朋友家里的小布头、铁线、小工具也经常不见，经过调查，才知道是他们拿去制造什么产品去了。公安派出所对这些小朋友感到有些伤脑筋，每隔一个时期，总是要集中他们来教育一番，并且通知学校和小朋友们的爸爸妈妈，好好地“管教”他们。有时学校对他们这些行为，也进行了处分，爸爸妈妈也打骂过他们，不准他们出去，但问题还是不能解决。
    我们亲爱的党是最关怀我们小朋友的。中共北流县委知道这件事情后，认为这不能光责备我们小朋友，应该使我们小朋友放学以后，也有一个活动的场所，使我们很好地受到共产主义教育，很好地学习、劳动和生活。于是县委提出要建立“少年之家”。
    用自己的双手建起“少年之家”
    北流县城有三千多个六岁到十五岁的小朋友。当县委提出建立“少年之家”的时候，有人认为，这么多人参加活动，一定要政府拨很多钱来盖大房子，买大批用具。但县委不同意这种意见，明确地提出，要做到：“勤俭起家、劳动建家、群众办家”。县委庞书记亲自挂帅，担任建“家”筹备委员会主任。他召开了机关干部大会，宣传建“家”的好处，号召各机关单位，大力支持“少年之家”，为“少年之家”送书画、桌椅、各种用具和玩具等。在党的关怀下，在各方面的大力支持下，“少年之家”便在1956年元旦成立了。
    “少年之家”的地址，是一座破庙。除了几间空房子外，什么东西也没有。虽然政府支持我们，群众也送了不少礼物，还是不能满足我们的要求。县委指示，用我们小朋友劳动的双手，把“家”建起来。团县委按照党的指示，发动全县五万多小朋友支援“少年之家”。小朋友们把捡来的九万多斤稻谷送来了；县城的几个小学，也发动了三千多同学参加建“家”的劳动，搬走黄泥一百一十土方，河沙二百方，收集旧砖四万多块，填平了二十个土方的土地，粉刷了全部墙壁，修建了滑冰场、露天舞池。经过一个多月的艰苦劳动，修建工作终于完成了，一座荒凉的古庙变成了儿童的乐园。
      “少年之家”的前面，有一条美丽的圭江，每年春暖花开的时候，小朋友们都到河边游戏。我们多么想到河中间去划船，学习海军叔叔们勇敢的精神呀！小朋友们提出，要成立“红色少年造船厂”。小朋友们推选了木工的儿子当厂长，有一百六十多个小工人参加了造船工作。在工人叔叔的指导下，用一个暑假的时间，便做成三十一只小船。当我们划着自己亲手制成的小船的时候，我们是多么高兴啊！我们想，我们真像英勇保卫祖国的小海军了。
    为了丰富“少年之家”的活动内容，我们还做了各种模型、用具、玩具；用坏了就自己修理。凡是自己能够做的，都自己做，不浪费国家一分钱。
    丰富多采的活动
    我们的“少年之家”办起来以后，怎样开展活动呢？年纪大的，知识多的，他们爱搞创造，就参加电工、化工、气象、农业试验等小组；姐姐们喜欢缝衣服、绣花的，就参加缝纫小组和绣花小组。其他还按各人的爱好，分别参加歌舞、滑冰、球赛等活动。我们“少年之家”先后共组织七十多个专业小组，有一千三百多个小朋友参加。小弟弟、小妹妹们，不参加专业小组，就看图识字，做泥工，养小白兔，做各种有趣味的劳动和游戏。
    去年，党的八届八中全会，向全国人民提出：反对右倾、保卫三面红旗。“少年之家”就配合学校对小朋友进行“三面红旗万万岁”的教育。我们请了刚从北京开会回来的叔叔，给小朋友们介绍祖国建设的成就，当他谈到人民大会堂建筑的时候，小朋友们都高兴得跳起来。听了报告，我们知道了总路线、大跃进、人民公社真是好。我们又到公社去参观，看到公社的生产、生活样样都好，受到很大教育。有个小朋友说：“过去我对人民公社不够热爱，认为公共食堂不自由，到公社参观后，见到公社生产这么好，猪这么大，我是多么热爱公社啊！”
    去年暑假，我们组织了一次十分钟的火车旅行。从玉林坐火车到仁东，正好是十分钟。大家都是头一次坐火车，在火车上看到的、听到的，都是新鲜的东西，学到不少知识。当我们正谈得很热闹的时候，十分钟过了，到了车站下了车，回来时走路，天气很热，十五里路走了两小时，弄得大家满身大汗。辅导员便对我们说，这次旅行，你们有什么感想。大家都说，坐火车只用十分钟，走路回来花了两个钟头，火车的威力真大啊！张碧泽小朋友说：“发展重工业，才有钢铁来建设铁路，我们要大力支援重工业，赶快实现工业化”。
    在“植树造林、除四害、讲卫生、讲普通话”的活动中，我们也开展得很好。1958年，我们开辟了八亩地的少年花果园。今年，为了响应团中央的号召，我们两千多个小朋友，用两天时间，种了蓖麻一万四千多株，木豆三千五百多株。
    1956年建家以来，在叔叔阿姨们的帮助下，我们办了二十多个小工厂，做成了二十五种产品，实验发报机、自动旋车、颗粒肥料、人造棉，还有些别的，我们都会做了。参加电工小组的杨文成小朋友，今年十三岁，在广播站叔叔的指导下，学会了做矿石收音机、装拆收音机，还和电工组的小朋友，一起做无线电发报机，电笔、电动机等。有一次，建筑工程队的喇叭坏了，也送到“少年之家”电工小组来修。少年农业试验站，配合学校农业课，进行了有性和无性杂交、改良品种等十四种农业试验，改良玉米品种的成绩也很好。
    我们“少年之家”，在节日都高高兴兴地举行体育比赛、文艺比赛，星期六还经常举行晚会。红领巾歌舞团李雅梅等几个演员在养小白兔的时候，很注意小白兔的生活习惯和动作，创作了一个很有教育意义的“小白兔舞”。去年，我们的歌舞团，在辅导员和教师的指导下，创作了“采树种舞”、“深耕舞”等三十多个节目，其中“采树种舞”还得到了县文艺会演一等奖。县委书记很爱看我们的节目，常来参加我们的晚会。现在我们歌舞团的演员，已经有三个考上广西艺术学院少年班，有一个保送专区文工团，有三个保送县文工团。
    我们“少年之家”的图书馆，有十二万本书，每天都开放。少年照相馆，可以自己照相，洗相片，冲洗一张相片，只要三分钱。我们每次开晚会，都自己放幻灯，不收钱，也“凭票入场”。我们的放映技术可好啦，讲解员是小朋友自己当，坐位又离布幕很近，看的、听的都很清楚，小朋友们很爱看，每次放映都坐得满满的。记得有一次，有一个小朋友，买了电影票，后来知道“少年之家”也放幻灯，他便退了电影票，跑来看自己的幻灯。
    通过这些活动，小朋友们的共产主义觉悟有很大提高。我们热爱劳动，也热爱劳动人民，热爱集体，热爱公共财产。几年来，“少年之家”没有发现过有人偷东西。去年，小朋友们捡到东西还给原主的就有一百二十件。两年来，有二十八个爱胡闹、懒劳动、偷东西的小朋友现在变成好孩子了。小朋友陆家瑞，去年爱偷东西，参加“少年之家”的活动后，思想进步了，去年捡到十一块多钱，自动还给原主。小朋友们对工人叔叔、农民叔叔很尊敬，帮助扫街工人扫街，帮助农民叔叔推木车，这是常见的事。车缝小组去年以来，为小朋友们缝补衣服三百二十多件。
    我们“少年之家”的活动，密切结合党的中心工作，结合学校教育，所以党委满意，爸爸妈妈满意，小朋友们也满意。陵城小学校长说：“‘少年之家’是同学们的第二课堂。”各学校老师都欢迎他们的学生参加少年之家的活动。李仲宜小朋友说：“我一天不到少年之家，心里总是不安的。”陵城小学的一位老师到莫昌平的家里去找他，他母亲说：“你想找我的儿子，不用到别处去，到‘少年之家’就一定能见到他了。”
    学习自己管理自己
    我们的“少年之家”，每天都有五、六百个小朋友参加活动，多的时候有一千多人。这么多小朋友怎么领导呢？我们只有两个专职辅导员，其中有一个，还经常下乡，参加中心工作。剩下一个辅导员，怎么管我们这么多人呢？党教导我们：要学习自己管理自己。“少年之家”办起来以后，大家就讨论：“怎样才能把
  ‘家’办好呢？梁诗全小朋友说：“‘少年之家’，是共产党领导我们用劳动办起来的，我们一定要把它办好。”大家都说：“我们要爱家，要为家工作。”接着就组织了“家”的管理委员会，选好的小朋友担任各组的组长。车缝小组组长胡成清，她家是车缝，造船厂厂长张广超，他家是做木工的，理发组长曹有泉，他的爸爸是理发工人，别的组长也是这样。这些小朋友都是思想好、学习好、工作好，大部分是队干和班干。我们活动中有困难，就请有关单位的叔叔、阿姨帮助解决。我们经常得到广播站、农业试验站、农场、县文工团等单位的指导。
    为了把活动搞好，每天有十多名小朋友担任值日员。他们的工作是管理玩具、出借图书、维持纪律和管理清洁卫生。我们的值日员，工作是很负责的。去年有一次，陵城小学的小朋友去看电影“兰兰与冬冬”，大家正看得津津有味的时候，陈建军小朋友忽然跑到班主任面前说：“老师我不看了，我要回去。”老师说：“看完再回去，我送你回家。”陈建军说：“不，我回‘少年之家’，今天是我值日。”老师同意后，他就跑到“少年之家”去了。最近“少年之家”门前开群众大会，许多人到“少年之家”来借凳子坐，值日员一直等到深夜散会后，把会场剩下的几张凳子全部搬回“少年之家”才回去睡觉。
    伯伯叔叔阿姨们，我们只做了这么点点成绩，党和团就给我们很大鼓励。团中央第一书记胡耀邦叔叔前年到我们“少年之家”，给了我们许多重要指示，还送给我们收音机和好多图书。中央新闻电影制片厂也到我们“少家之家”来拍电影。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的叔叔、阿姨们也送给我们许多珍贵的礼物。这都给我们很大的鼓舞。
    今后我们还要很好地听党的话，继续鼓足干劲，把“少年之家”办得更好。我们很希望代表叔叔、伯伯、阿姨们到我们“少年之家”去参观、指导。
