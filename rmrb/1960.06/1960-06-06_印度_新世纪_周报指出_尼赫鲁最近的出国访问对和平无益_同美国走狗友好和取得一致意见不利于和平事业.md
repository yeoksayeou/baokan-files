Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 3rd – A recent issue of the Indian weekly “New Age” published an article by Mohit Sen, stating that Nehru's recent trip abroad did not contribute to India's national interests, nor to world peace. The article called for extensive discussion of Nehru's visit and vigilance.

The article mentioned Tito and Nasser's attempts to form some kind of "neutralist" bloc, saying that any such bloc was unlikely to contribute to the easing of the international situation and would only help the warmongers in the United States.

Referring to Nehru's joint communique with Turkey's Menderes, the article said, "Nehru signed a joint statement with the open and direct puppet of U.S. imperialism." It said, "It is extremely strange that Nehru could find common ground with Menderes in estimating the breakdown of the summit meeting."

The article pointed out that U.S. imperialists "have damaged the cause of easing world tensions, which requires not friendship or agreement with war makers and their running dogs, but a relentless struggle against them."

The article said, "When Menderes desperately tried to save face for his tottering rule, Nehru agreed to let him use his name and the name of our country, which reached the height of hypocrisy, even worse than hypocrisy. Nehru's vague answer to Turkish journalists in Ankara was only adding shame to shame."

The article pointed out, "India is not a friend of Menderes, just as it is not a friend of Syngman Rhee or Chiang Kai-shek. There are no urgent, outstanding issues between the two countries that require the overworked Indian Prime Minister to personally visit."

Referring to Nehru's attitude towards the four-power summit meeting in the joint communique he issued with Nasser in Cairo, the article said that the absence of any opinion on the United States' determination to sabotage the four-power summit meeting was an unusually inappropriate attitude. "This extremely strange silence is consistent with Nehru's earlier speech in Cairo, when he said that even if he knew all the facts about the U-2 plane violating the Soviet border, he would not express an opinion. This attitude can only help the warmongers in the United States who are facing complete isolation."

The article said that this is "a wrong and harmful understanding of the policy of non-alignment and Panchsheel."

The article said, "Panchsheel requires open and unambiguous condemnation of the United States. Only worldwide protests and condemnations will help isolate the hotheads in the United States and restrain their provocative activities that seriously threaten peace and openly challenge the sovereignty of all countries."

The article said, "World public opinion, like Indian democratic public opinion, cannot but feel uneasy and disappointed that Nehru and Nasser have failed to fulfill their basic responsibilities."

### 印度“新世纪”周报指出  尼赫鲁最近的出国访问对和平无益  同美国走狗友好和取得一致意见不利于和平事业

    印度“新世纪”周报指出
    尼赫鲁最近的出国访问对和平无益
    同美国走狗友好和取得一致意见不利于和平事业
    新华社新德里3日电　最近一期印度“新世纪”周报刊载莫希特·森写的一篇文章指出，尼赫鲁的这次出国旅行无助于印度的国家利益，也无助于世界和平。文章要求对尼赫鲁这次出国访问进行广泛的讨论，并且保持警惕。
    文章提到铁托和纳赛尔主张搞某种“中立主义”集团的企图时说，任何这种集团很不可能对国际局势的缓和作出任何贡献。而只会帮助美国的好战分子。
    文章在谈到尼赫鲁同土耳其曼德列斯发表联合公报时说，“尼赫鲁同美帝国主义的公开的直接傀儡签订联合声明”。它说，“极其奇怪的是，在估计最高级会议破裂方面尼赫鲁竟能发现同曼德列斯有共同之点。”
    文章指出，美帝国主义者“损害了缓和世界紧张局势的事业，这个事业所要求的不是同战争制造者和他们的走狗友好或者取得一致意见，而是对他们展开无情的斗争。”
    文章说，“在曼德列斯拚命企图给他的摇摇欲坠的统治撑面子的时候，尼赫鲁竟会答应让他利用他的名字和我们国家的名字，这达到了伪善的极点，甚至比伪善更坏。尼赫鲁在安卡拉对土耳其记者的含糊的回答只是耻上加耻而已。”
    文章指出，“印度并不是曼德列斯的朋友，正如它不是李承晚或蒋介石的朋友一样。两国之间没有什么需要立即解决的、要求过劳的印度总理亲自访问的迫切的悬而未决的问题。”
    文章谈到尼赫鲁在开罗同纳赛尔发表的联合公报中对四国首脑会议的态度时说，没有对美国决心破坏四国首脑会议表示任何意见，这是一种异常不适当的态度。“这种极其奇怪的沉默同尼赫鲁早些时候在开罗发表的讲话是一致的。他当时说，即使他知道U—2型飞机侵越苏联边界的一切事实，他也不表示意见。这种态度只能帮助面临着完全孤立的美国的好战分子。”
    文章说，这是“对不结盟和潘查希拉政策的一种错误和有害的理解。”
    文章说，“潘查希拉要求公开地、毫不含糊地谴责美国。只有全世界的抗议和谴责才有助于孤立美国头脑发热的人和约束他们那种严重威胁着和平的挑衅活动和向一切国家的主权进行公开挑战。”
    文章说，“世界舆论同印度民主舆论一样，对尼赫鲁和纳赛尔没有尽到他们的基本责任不能不感到不安和失望。”
