Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th. A total of 485,000 people in the northern Korean cities of Chongjin, Kaesong, Haeju, Sariwon, Wonsan, Hyesan, Kanggye, Sinuiju, and Hamhung held rallies and demonstrations yesterday and today, condemning the heinous crimes of American imperialism in its aggression against Korea and demanding that American aggressor troops get out of South Korea immediately.

At these mass rallies, local leading cadres and representatives from all walks of life spoke. On the 24th, at a mass rally of 80,000 people in Chongjin City, Seo Eul-hyun, Chairman of the North Hamgyong Province Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, said that on the 10th anniversary of the "June 25th" incident, the Korean people harbor even greater hatred and anger towards the American beasts who have inflicted disaster and misfortune on them. He said that the wolfish nature of American imperialism has been exposed all over the world. The suppression and deception of the US imperialists and the Huh Jung clique can never subdue the South Korean people.

At a mass rally of 10,000 people in Kaesong City, near the armistice line, worker representative Kim Dong-soo said: The mere mention of American imperialism makes me gnash my teeth in anger. They have slaughtered countless of our compatriots with all kinds of barbaric means. The American imperialists are wolves in human skin and the deadly enemies of the Korean people. The American imperialists must be judged.

Lee Jae-young, Chairman of the North Hwanghae Province Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, said at a rally of 50,000 people in Sariwon City that as long as American imperialism occupies South Korea, the reunification of the fatherland cannot be realized, and the South Korean people cannot see the light of day. We must further strengthen the construction of the democratic base in the northern part of the Republic, and we must drive the US military out of South Korea and peacefully unify the fatherland.

    美国侵略军立即滚出南朝鲜！
    朝鲜北部近五十万人集会示威
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜北部清津、开城、海州、沙里院、元山、惠山、江界、新义州、咸兴等城市共四十八万五千多人先后在昨天和今天举行大会和示威，谴责美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的滔天罪行，并要美国侵略军立即滚出南朝鲜。
    在这些群众大会上，当地的领导干部和各界人民代表讲了话。24日，在清津市举行的八万群众的大会上，朝鲜劳动党咸镜北道委员会委员长徐乙贤说，在“六·二五”十周年的时候，朝鲜人民对于把灾难和不幸强加在朝鲜人民头上的美国野兽更加憎恨和愤怒。他说，美帝国主义的狼的本性在世界各地都暴露出来了。美帝国主义同许政集团的镇压和欺骗决不能使南朝鲜人民屈服。
    在靠近停战线的开城市举行的有一万人参加的群众大会上，工人代表金东洙说：我一听到美帝国主义这个名词就禁不住咬牙切齿地愤怒。它们用种种野蛮的手段屠杀了我们无数的同胞。美帝国主义者是披着人皮的狼，是朝鲜人民的死敌。必须审判美帝国主义者。
    朝鲜劳动党黄海北道委员会委员长李在英在沙里院市举行的五万人的大会上讲话时说，只要美帝国主义侵占着南朝鲜，就不能实现祖国的统一，南朝鲜人民也不能重见天日。我们要进一步加强共和国北部的民主基地的建设，一定要把美军赶出南朝鲜，和平统一祖国。
