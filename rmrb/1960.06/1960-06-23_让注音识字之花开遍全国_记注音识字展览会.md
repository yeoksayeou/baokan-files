    Let the Flowers of Zhuyin Literacy Blossom Across the Nation
    ——A Record of the Zhuyin Literacy Exhibition
    By Our Staff Reporter Zhang Lijun

    "One tree blooms with two flowers, learning both characters and Mandarin." People visiting the Zhuyin Literacy Exhibition unanimously used this phrase to praise the benefits of Zhuyin literacy.
    The Zhuyin Literacy Exhibition was held in Beijing from June 5th to June 24th, with over 13,000 visitors. Among those who visited the exhibition were representatives from various regions attending the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes, as well as representatives from factories, rural people's communes, or military units in Beijing. There were also primary school teachers and kindergarten educators. The exhibition aroused great interest among the visitors, who all expressed that after seeing the exhibition, their confidence in vigorously promoting Zhuyin literacy had increased a hundredfold.
    The students in the third grade and above at Yangrou Hutong Primary School in Xicheng District, Beijing, had not learned the Pinyin alphabet and were originally planning to start teaching it next semester. After Gao Ying and several other language teachers from the school visited the exhibition, they believed that Zhuyin literacy was the best method for implementing more, faster, better, and more economical language teaching, and they prepared to teach the students immediately after the end-of-term exams. Su Yunhua, an educator at the No. 1 Kindergarten in Mishi Hutong, was very excited after visiting the exhibition. She expressed her determination to be a cultural revolution vanguard and actively promote Zhuyin literacy. Now, everyone in their kindergarten, whether educators, cooks, or entrusted older children, has launched a wave of learning the Pinyin alphabet.
    Liu Jian and others, research interns at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stated after the visit that they would better integrate their research projects such as language reform with Zhuyin literacy and the promotion of Mandarin in the future, to serve the socialist cultural construction cause.
    The visiting group from Yanbian Han Language Normal School wrote in the guestbook: "Through the visit, we realized that Zhuyin literacy is also a very important tool for ethnic minorities to learn Chinese. After returning, we must make good use of the Zhuyin literacy method to improve the quality of Chinese teaching."
      Zhuyin Literacy is a Magic Weapon
    A prominent impression left on people by the exhibition is that a vigorous nationwide movement to learn Zhuyin literacy has been launched in full swing across the country. Zhuyin literacy is deeply rooted in people's hearts and is welcomed not only by young and middle-aged people, but also by the elderly and young people. Many charts show that whether in cities or rural areas, on plains or in mountainous areas, or even in areas with complex dialects, the method of annotating Chinese characters with Pinyin letters can be used without exception to help recognize Chinese characters and promote Mandarin. A illiterate or semi-literate person can generally learn the Pinyin alphabet after twenty to thirty hours of teaching; after more than one hundred hours of teaching, they can use Pinyin to recognize 1,500 Chinese characters, reaching the standard for graduating from literacy classes. Once the masses master the Pinyin tool, they can rely on it to independently read a large number of Zhuyin books and newspapers, and continuously increase the number of characters they know through self-study.
    The advantages of Zhuyin literacy lie in: eliminating the phenomenon of large-scale relapse after literacy campaigns, solving the problem of consolidation and improvement after literacy campaigns; accelerating the speed of literacy campaigns, shortening the duration of spare-time education; solving the problem of early reading and early writing; facilitating the self-study of workers and peasants in a decentralized manner during work breaks; and creating extremely favorable conditions for the promotion of Mandarin.
    At the exhibition, a record book using pictures instead of words attracted a group of viewers. This was the work notebook that Zhang Wenshun, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Nanwaizi Management District of the Chalukou People's Commune in Yongji County, Jilin Province, had used for many years. Zhang Wenshun started working as a cadre in 1952, working hard but regrettably unable to recognize even a few large characters. Whenever there was a meeting, he would draw pigs when the leadership assigned pig farming; he would draw little people for the work of nurseries; and he would draw a frame filled with black dots for close planting. Of course, this kind of "picture writing" could not record many things, and after returning to the management area, he could only convey a few sentences to the masses. Zhang Wenshun participated in Zhuyin literacy learning in November 1959, and removed the label of illiteracy after only two months. From then on, his notebook no longer resorted to pictures. When he encountered a character he did not know how to write, he would use Pinyin letters instead.
    There are many examples like Zhang Wenshun in rural areas. The masses reflected: "Pinyin letters are a magic weapon, the teacher follows along, ask it when encountering a new character, use it as a guide for reading, write articles by yourself, only then is a great cultural transformation."
    Illiterates Open Their Eyes, Steeds Gain Wings
    After the vast number of workers and peasants mastered the Pinyin alphabet, the difficulty of writing was greatly reduced. As a result, reading became a trend, and poetry competitions and literary contests became fashionable.
    At the exhibition, Cheng Shuqian and Cheng Kuanniu from Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, were two of the thousands upon thousands of cultural newcomers who emerged after the promotion of Zhuyin literacy. They were warmly welcomed by the audience. Many viewers surrounded them, asking them to leave their names in Pinyin characters in their notebooks, and some asked them to compose poems. Cheng Shuqian, a 48-year-old woman who was illiterate two years ago, had already left nearly two hundred poems for the audience during the short seven days of the exhibition.
    "The awns of wheat ripen, gold everywhere; the fields are full of gold harvesters; sweat rolls, sickles fly, like cutting bamboo in Nanshan." This is the poem she wrote on the theme of "Busy in May." Someone else asked her to write a poem on the theme of "Hanyu Pinyin." She immediately wrote: "Difficulties can't scare heroes, the ambition to leap forward remains unchanged, earnestly learn Pinyin characters, step by step climb the mountain of science."
    Cheng Shuqian wrote poems almost extemporaneously, with little hesitation. She also wrote beautifully. She has now mastered more than 3,000 Chinese characters and can use them freely.
    In fact, it is not just Wanrong County that is like this. The exhibition tells us that in Fujian, Shandong, Heilongjiang, etc., a new atmosphere and new appearance of the cultural revolution high tide beginning to arrive are everywhere.
    Wanrong County in Shanxi Province, Pingyuan County in Shandong Province, Zhaoyuan County in Heilongjiang Province, and Xiaoxian County in Anhui Province, through large-scale reading, large-scale writing, and large-scale discussions, combining reading, writing, and using, combining key analysis and explanation with guided large-scale reading, making concentrated attacks in stages, and advancing units directly, have accelerated the progress of spare-time higher primary schools. In the past, it took two or three years to graduate from spare-time higher primary schools, but now it only takes five or six months to reach the graduation level.
    The exhibition showed some convincing figures: Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, an advanced unit attending the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes, after adopting the Zhuyin literacy method last year, eliminated more illiterates than in the past eight years combined, and increased two and a half times more than in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. They not only completed the historical task of eliminating illiteracy, but also established 177 technical schools on the basis of popularizing spare-time higher primary schools, with more than 100,000 workers and peasants participating in technical school studies. The county has now trained more than 12,000 technicians, who have made many innovations and creations in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. After the peasants in the county mastered the Pinyin tool, another 320,000 people participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Wang Yuehai, a model in theoretical study, was still illiterate in 1958. After graduating from Zhuyin literacy classes this spring, he used Pinyin letters to study "On Contradiction," wrote 30,000 words of study notes, and applied what he learned to production.
    Dialect Areas Are No Exception
    Is there an exception to the promotion of Zhuyin literacy in dialect areas? The exhibition gave us a powerful answer.
    Fujian Province is the province with the most complex dialects. In the Fujian section of the exhibition, the first thing you can see is a distribution map of the ten major dialects in the Fujian region. The commentator made an interesting explanation: In the early days of liberation, a county party secretary from another province in Datian County had to go through six translators to convey his meaning to every cadre when he spoke at an expanded cadre meeting. If cadres traveled from one county to another, translators were even more indispensable. Therefore, the vast number of people in Fujian Province have always had a need to learn Mandarin. Datian County is a red flag in the nationwide promotion of Mandarin. At that time, the method of promoting Mandarin was to teach word-of-mouth, sentence by sentence, which was quite difficult. Chen Jinshi, a representative who attended the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes and was twice named a national youth socialist construction activist, is a banner for promoting Mandarin in Wushan Township, Datian County. In 1958, at the first national Mandarin observation meeting, she was the only specially invited peasant representative. It was at that meeting that she learned Zhuyin literacy under the care of Wu Yuzhang, director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee. After returning, she became an active promoter of Zhuyin literacy. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of the entire party and the large-scale mass movement, the entire province of Fujian has formed a climax of "everyone speaks, speaks everywhere, speaks in everything" in promoting Mandarin, and has achieved brilliant results. Now, the majority of young and middle-aged people in the province have basically learned Mandarin, and on this basis, more than 80% of the young, middle-aged, and elderly people have learned the Pinyin alphabet.
    The Fujian section also focused on introducing the experience of Datian County, Jiangle County, and the Sanming Iron and Steel Base in carrying out the "Pinyin, literacy, promotion of Mandarin" three-combination. Experience proves that Zhuyin literacy is not only a fast, good, and economical literacy method in the northern dialect area, but also an effective fast, good, and economical literacy method in the dialect area. In the past, it took about two years to eliminate an illiterate in the Nankou Brigade of Jiangle County. Now, using the Zhuyin literacy three-combination method, it only takes three months to eliminate an illiterate, and Mandarin can also be learned well at the same time.
      The "Pinyin, literacy, promotion of Mandarin" three-combination method has also achieved remarkable results in Shexian County, Anhui Province. This is a mountainous area with an unusually complex dialect. There are several different ways of saying the same word in Mandarin in the Chakou People's Commune. More than 500 of the 1,500 commonly used Chinese characters are pronounced differently from Chakou. Because of the different languages, literacy education requires dialect translation, which is very slow. In March of last year, through the three-combination Zhuyin literacy movement, illiteracy was completely eliminated in less than two months, forming a new atmosphere in which everyone spoke Mandarin.
      Paving the Way for Teaching Reform
    At the exhibition, many charts showed that the Pinyin alphabet also played a great role in primary school language teaching: it accelerated the speed of literacy, improved reading and writing skills, and improved the quality of Mandarin. This provides favorable conditions for the teaching reform and school system reform of primary schools. The experience of the advanced collective attending the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes, the Sandaozhen Primary School in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, in reforming the Pinyin alphabet teaching method was exhibited here. They adopted the method of teaching the alphabet first, and then using the method of "the initial and final sounds are inseparable, the syllables are fixed, the original sound carries the final sound, and the tone is directly determined," it only took five weeks for the children to skillfully spell out 400 syllables, and to be able to read all the syllables and Pinyin-Chinese character comparison readings. The second-grade students who know the most characters have reached more than 3,000 characters.
    The statistical materials of Yucai Primary School in Shenyang City exhibited in the Liaoning Province section show that: After this school strengthened the Pinyin alphabet teaching from the first grade, it used to take one class hour to learn more than a dozen characters and they were still not consolidated, but now one class hour teaches 42 new characters, and the rate of students being able to remember them firmly after class accounts for 92.3%. Within four months from February to May this year, first-grade students were able to recognize 1,600 characters, and generally able to write short articles with fluent sentences and complete content of about 500 words.
    If these written materials are not enough to convince those who are bound by the bourgeois principle of "measuring strength," then Song Dezeng, a child who performed publicly at the exhibition, is a good example. He is a first-grade student at Furong Street Primary School in Jinan City, Shandong Province, and is only eight years old this year. He and more than 50 children in the class, with the help of the Pinyin alphabet, have read an average of more than 50 Zhuyin readings each, and can generally recognize more than 1,200 Chinese characters. Song Dezeng can fluently read the language textbooks from the first to the eighth grade of elementary school. On the day that Lin Feng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Wu Yuzhang, director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, and other central leaders visited the exhibition, they asked Song Dezeng to read aloud the lesson "Two Diaries" in the eighth-grade language textbook. He read it very fluently and with full of expression, winning praise from the audience at the meeting.
    Shouldn't we let such children walk backwards and read the first-grade language textbook?
      Zhuyin Literacy Brought into Kindergartens
    At the exhibition, several children from kindergartens in Shanxi, Shandong, and Anhui attracted the interest of the audience. Liu Yili, Bu Wen, and Wang Wei, children from the Jiangsu Road Private Kindergarten in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, are all six years old, and they publicly performed their reading and writing abilities. Here is a non-Zhuyin Chinese character table including 569 relatively complex character shapes such as "hammer, axe, general line, great leap forward", and they recognized the characters on it one by one. These children can also self-compile application problems and calculate addition and subtraction within "one hundred". Such results are already equivalent to the level of the first grade of elementary school. Wu Jiansheng, a six-year-old girl from the Ronghe People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, told stories to the audience in Shanxi dialect and Mandarin.
    Through these vivid facts, it is proved that children in kindergarten can fully learn the Pinyin alphabet, and can also use the Zhuyin literacy method to recognize a batch of Chinese characters.

    The CPC Central Committee pointed out in its instructions on promoting Zhuyin literacy: Zhuyin literacy is a very important creation in China's cultural revolution and should be rapidly promoted throughout the country. At present, more than 20 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have promoted Zhuyin literacy. Let us wish the flowers of Zhuyin literacy to bloom more brightly and brilliantly throughout the country, and to shine in China's cultural revolution! (Attached pictures)

    让注音识字之花开遍全国
    ——记注音识字展览会
    本报记者　张丽君
    “一棵树开两朵花，又识字，又学普通话。”到注音识字展览会来参观的人们，异口同声地用这句话来赞扬注音识字的好处。
    注音识字展览会从6月5日到6月24日在北京展出，参观人数一万三千多人。来参观这次展览会的有出席全国文教群英会的各地代表，也有来自北京市的工厂、城乡人民公社或部队的代表。有小学教师和幼儿园的教养员。这个展览会引起了参观者的极大兴趣，他们都表示：看了展览会之后，对于大搞注音识字增强了百倍信心。
    北京市西城区羊肉胡同小学三年级以上的学生都没有学过拼音字母，本来打算下学期才开始教。这个学校高英等几个语文教师参观了展览会以后，认为注音识字是语文教学贯彻多快好省的最好方法，准备一结束期终考试，马上教会学生。米市胡同第一幼儿园的教养员苏蕴华参观展览会以后，非常兴奋。她表示要做一名文化革命的尖兵，积极推广注音识字。现在，她们全园无论是教养员、炊事员，或是受托的大班儿童，都掀起了学习拼音字母的热潮。
    中国科学院语言研究所研究实习员刘坚等人，在参观以后表示：今后要更好地把他们的文字改革等研究项目和注音识字、推广普通话结合起来，为社会主义文化建设事业服务。
    延边汉语师范学校的参观小组在留言簿上写着：“通过参观，使我们认识到：注音识字对于少数民族学习汉语也是非常重要的工具。回去以后，一定要好好地运用注音识字法提高汉语教学的质量。”
      注音识字是法宝
    展览会给人们留下的一个突出印象是：一个声势磅礴的全民学习注音识字运动，已经在全国各地轰轰烈烈地展开了。注音识字深入人心，不仅是青壮年欢迎，老年、少年也能接受。很多图表表明：无论在城市或者农村，是平原还是山区，甚至是方言复杂的地区，都无例外地可以用拼音字母给汉字注音的办法来帮助认识汉字，推广普通话。一个文盲或半文盲一般经过二十到三十小时的教学，就可以学会拼音字母；再经过一百多个小时的教学，就可以利用拼音认识一千五百个汉字，达到扫盲毕业标准。群众掌握了拼音工具，就可以依靠它无师自通地大量阅读注音书报，并且在自学中不断增加识字数量。
    注音识字的优越性在于：消灭了扫盲以后大量回生的现象，解决了扫盲后的巩固和提高问题；加快了扫盲的速度，缩短了业余教育的年限；解决了早期阅读和早期写作的问题；便于工农群众利用劳动间隙分散自学；为推广普通话创造了极为有利的条件。
    展览会上，一个用图画代替文字的记录本吸引了一群观众。这是吉林省永吉县岔路河人民公社南崴子管理区党支部副书记张文顺使用了多年的工作笔记本。张文顺从1952年开始当干部，工作上埋头苦干，遗憾的是他连斗大的字都认不了几个。每逢开会，领导上布置养猪，他画猪；布置托儿所工作，他画小人；布置密植，他画一个框框，上面点满了黑点。这种“图画文字”当然记不下很多东西，回到管理区向群众传达几句就没说的了。张文顺从1959年11月参加注音识字学习，只经过两个月，就摘掉了文盲帽子。从此，他的笔记本再也不求助于图画了。碰到不会写的字，就用拼音字母来代替。
    像张文顺这样的例子，在农村中是不少的。群众反映说：“拼音字母是法宝，老师随身跟着跑，遇到生字把它问，阅读它当领路人，自己读书写文章，才是文化大翻身。”
    文盲睁开眼、骏马添双翼
    广大工农群众掌握了拼音字母以后，大大地减少了写作的困难。于是，读书成风，赛诗比文形成风尚。
    展览会上，来自山西省万荣县的程淑欠和程宽牛，就是推广注音识字以后涌现出来的千千万万个文化新人中的两个。他们受到观众们的热烈欢迎。很多观众围着他们，请他们用拼音字在笔记本上留下名字，有人出题请他们作诗。两年以前还是文盲的四十八岁的程淑欠老大娘在展览会的短短七天期间，已经给观众留下了近二百首诗歌。
    “芒种麦熟遍地金，田间尽是收金人；汗水滚滚镰刀飞，好似南山砍竹林。”这是她以“五月忙”为题作的诗。有人又以“汉语拼音”为题请她作诗。她马上写道：“困难吓不倒英雄汉，跃进雄心不改变，认真学好拼音字，步步登上科学山。”
    程淑欠写诗简直是出口成章，很少迟疑。字也写得漂亮。她现在已经掌握了三千多个汉字，并且能够运用自如。
    其实，何止万荣县是这样呢，展览会告诉我们：福建、山东、黑龙江，……到处表现出了文化革命的高潮开始到来的新气象，新面貌。
    山西省万荣县，山东省平原县，黑龙江省肇源县和安徽省萧县，通过大阅读、大写作、大讨论，读、写、用相结合，重点分析讲解和有指导地大量阅读相结合的办法，分段突击，单元直进，一气呵成，加快了业余高小的进度。过去业余高小要两三年才毕业，现在，只用五、六个月就能达到毕业水平。
    展览会上，展出了一些令人信服的数字：出席全国文教群英会的先进单位——山东省平原县，去年采用注音识字的办法后，扫除文盲的人数比过去八年的总和还多，比大跃进的1958年猛增了两倍半。他们不仅完成了扫盲的历史任务，而且在普及业余高小的基础上，办了一百七十七所技术学校，参加技术学校学习的工农群众达十万多人。这个县目前已经培养出一万二千多名技术人员，他们在技术革新和技术革命运动中有很多革新创造，大大推动了工农业生产的发展。全县农民掌握了拼音工具以后，还有三十二万人参加了毛主席著作的学习。理论学习模范王曰海，1958年还是个文盲，今年春天注音扫盲毕业后，他使用拼音字母学习了“矛盾论”，写出了三万字的读书心得，并且学以致用，在生产中发挥了作用。方言地区也不例外
    推广注音识字，在方言地区有没有例外呢？展览会上给了我们有力的回答。
    福建省是方言最复杂的省份。在展览会的福建部分，首先可以看到一张福建地区十种主要方言的分布图。讲解员作着有趣的说明：解放初期，大田县一个外省人的县委书记在干部扩大会上讲话，要通过六个翻译，才能把他的意思传达给每个干部。干部如果从一个县到另一个县，那翻译就更不可少了。所以，福建省的广大群众一向有学习普通话的要求。大田县就是全国推广普通话的一面红旗。当时推广普通话的办法是口口相传，一句句教，困难是相当多的。这次出席全国文教群英会的代表、两次被评为全国青年社会主义建设积极分子的陈进四就是大田县吴山乡推广普通话的一面旗帜。1958年，第一次全国普通话观摩会上，她是唯一的一个特邀的农民代表。就在那次会上，她在中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章的关怀下学会了注音识字。回去以后，她又成了注音识字的积极推广者。几年来，福建全省由于全党动手，大搞群众运动，形成了“人人说，处处说，事事说”的推广普通话的高潮，取得了辉煌成果。现在，全省的青壮年中已经基本上学会了普通话，并且在这个基础上，占少、青、壮年总人数的80％以上学会了拼音字母。
    福建部分，还重点介绍了大田县、将乐县和三明钢铁基地开展“拼音、识字、推广普通话”三结合的经验。经验证明：注音识字不仅是北方话地区多快好省的识字法，同样也是方言地区行之有效的多快好省的识字法。将乐县南口大队过去扫除一个文盲约需两年，现在用注音识字三结合的办法，只要三个月就可以扫除一个文盲，同时还能学好普通话。
      “拼音、识字、推广普通话”三结合的办法，在安徽省歙县同样取得了显著的效果。这是一个方言异常复杂的山区。普通话的一个词，岔口人民公社就有几种不同的说法。一千五百个常用汉字，就有五百多字与岔口不同音。语言不同，扫盲识字要用方言翻译，速度很慢。去年3月，他们通过三结合的注音识字运动，不到两个月就彻底扫除了文盲，形成了人人说普通话的新风气。
      为教学改革开道
    展览会上，很多图表表现出拼音字母在小学语文教学中，也发挥了很大的作用：它加快了识字速度，提高了阅读和写作能力，提高了普通话的质量。这就为小学的教学改革和学制改革提供了有利条件。这里展出了出席全国文教群英会的先进集体——黑龙江省拜泉县三道镇小学改革拼音字母教学方法的经验。他们采取先教字母表，后用“声韵不分家，音节固定化，本音带韵母，直接定音调”的方法，只用五周的时间就使儿童熟练地拼读四百个音节，并且能够阅读全部音节和拼音、汉字对照的读物。二年级学生识字最多的已经达到三千多字。
    辽宁省部分展出的沈阳市育才小学的统计材料说明：这个学校从一年级起加强了拼音字母教学以后，过去一个课时学十几个字还不巩固，现在一个课时要教四十二个生字，课后检查学生能记牢的比率占92．3％。今年2月到5月的四个月内，一年级学生都能识字一千六百个，普遍能写五百字左右的语句通顺、内容完整的短文。
    如果这一些文字材料还不足以说服那些被资产阶级的“量力性”原则所束缚的人们，那么来展览会当众表演的宋德增小朋友就是一个很好的例证。他是山东省济南市芙蓉街小学一年级的学生，今年才八岁。他和全班五十多个小朋友，由于拼音字母的帮助，平均每人都阅读了注音读物五十多本，普遍能认汉字一千二百多字。宋德增能流利地阅读初级小学一到八册的语文课本。中共中央委员、人大常委会副委员长林枫和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章等中央负责同志去参观展览会的那天，他们让宋德增朗读了第八册语文中的“两篇日记”一课。他读得非常流利，充满了表情，博得会场观众的好评。
    像这样的孩子，难道还能让他倒退着走路，去念第一册语文吗？
      注音识字带进了幼儿园
    展览会上有几个来自山西、山东和安徽的幼儿园大班的孩子，特别吸引着观众们的兴趣。山东省青岛市江苏路民办幼儿园大班的孩子刘亦理、卜文和王伟，都是六岁，他们当众表演读写能力。这里挂着一张包括五百六十九个如“锤、斧、总路线、大跃进”等较复杂字形的不注音的汉字表，他们把上面的字一个个认下来。这些小朋友还能自编应用题，计算“一百”以内的加减法。这样的成绩，已经相当于小学一年级的水平。来自山西省万荣县荣河人民公社的六岁女孩吴建生在会上用山西方言和普通话对照着给观众讲故事。
    通过这些活生生的事实，证明幼儿园大班的孩子完全能学好拼音字母，也能用注音识字的办法认识一批汉字。
            ×　×　×
    中共中央关于推广注音识字的指示中指出：注音识字是我国文化革命中一项很重要的创造，应当在全国迅速推广。目前已经有二十多个省市和自治区推广了注音识字，让我们预祝注音识字之花在全国开得更鲜艳、更灿烂，在我国的文化革命中放出异彩！（附图片）
