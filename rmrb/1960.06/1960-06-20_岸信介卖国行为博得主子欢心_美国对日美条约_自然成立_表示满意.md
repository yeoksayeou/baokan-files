Xinhua News Agency, June 19th Dispatch from Washington: Kishida Nobusuke's traitorous government, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, brazenly declared the U.S.-Japan military treaty to have "naturally come into effect." Although this vile act pleased its American masters, it cannot make them feel at ease.

When Kishida Nobusuke's report that he had completed the "ratification procedures" reached the U.S. State Department yesterday, there were only two reporters in the State Department's press room. However, the State Department immediately had its press officer, Riph, issue a statement to these two reporters, expressing satisfaction with Kishida Nobusuke's "loyalty."

According to reports, the U.S. State Department yesterday notified the leaders of the Senate, hoping that the Senate would quickly complete the ratification procedures for the U.S.-Japan military treaty so that it could begin to "take effect" before the Kishida Nobusuke government collapsed. U.S. government officials also blatantly stated that they hoped the Kishida Nobusuke government could last a few more days in order to have time to exchange the "instruments of ratification" between the two parties.

    岸信介卖国行为博得主子欢心
    美国对日美条约“自然成立”表示满意
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：岸信介卖国政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对悍然宣布美日军事条约“自然获得成立”的丑行，虽然博得了它的美国主子的欢心，但是并不能使他们感到安心。
    岸信介宣布他已经完成“批准手续”的报告昨天到达美国国务院时，国务院的记者室里只有两个记者，但是国务院立即让它的新闻发布官里普对这两个记者发表了一项声明，对岸信介的“效忠”表示满意。
    据报道，美国国务院昨天已通知参议院的领袖们，希望参议院赶快完成对美日军事条约的批准手续，以便使它能在岸信介政府垮台之前开始“生效”。美国政府官员还露骨地表示，他们希望岸信介政府能够再多维持几天，以便有时间交换双方的“批准书”。
