    Press Forward in Victory, Seize Complete Victory in Field Management
    The Qinghai Daily published an editorial entitled "Press Forward in Victory, Seize Complete Victory in Field Management" on strengthening field management of spring-sown crops. The editorial pointed out that the current overriding central task in rural areas is to make persistent efforts, press forward in victory, quickly launch a high tide of field management centered on weeding, and fight hard in June and July to strive for an even greater harvest this year. We must earnestly strengthen leadership, mobilize the entire party and the entire people, and grasp field management with even greater effort than we put into land reclamation and sowing. Continue to adopt leadership methods such as division of labor and responsibility, contracting to the end, and going deep into the fields with five levels of cadres meeting in the fields to effectively strengthen leadership in field management; continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, technical innovation, and technical revolution, continuously improve tools, and increase labor productivity. We must be determined to put most of the labor force into the weeding battle. In areas where the planting of late-season crops has not yet ended, in addition to transferring a portion of the labor force to continue rushing to plant late-season crops, the main force should be invested in field management; in areas where planting has ended, all forces should be concentrated on doing a good job in field management. June and July are the crucial moments for field management, requiring concentrating all efforts, working hard and skillfully for two months, and seizing complete victory in field management. Ensure that all irrigated land is weeded three times, and strive for two weedings for mountainous and newly reclaimed land, and achieve timely and appropriate watering and topdressing, and timely prevention and control of disasters such as hail, floods, frost, freezing, diseases, and insect pests, to achieve multiple varieties and multiple harvests, and high yield and multiple harvests.
    The editorial pointed out that the shortage of labor is the main difficulty in field management. The main ways to solve this problem are, on the one hand, to continuously improve labor organization and labor management, and on the other hand, to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and quickly create and promote various new and improved agricultural tools. It is necessary to further improve labor organization, rationally arrange the labor force for basic construction, sideline occupations, and community-run industries, and during the busy period of field management in June and July, ensure that more than 80% of the labor force is invested in field management. The basic construction labor force should be appropriately controlled, and during the busy season, the labor force from industry, sideline occupations, and basic construction can also be temporarily transferred to carry out shock weeding. According to the needs of field management, establish specialized teams, implement special fields, special personnel, and special responsibility, contract for tasks, contract for quality, and contract for time, and contract for everything to the end. In particular, strengthen the management of high-yield plots and third-class seedlings, add processing, add water, and add fertilizer to ensure that third-class seedlings do not pass the tillering stage. In accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, widely carry out large-scale cooperation between mountains and rivers, farms and communes, and teams, concentrate superior forces, and attack weak links.
    Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and quickly creating and promoting various new and improved agricultural tools, is the most effective way to solve the shortage of labor, and the only correct way to do a good job in field management in a faster, better, and more economical way. It is necessary to further publicize and create momentum, deeply mobilize the masses, let everyone use their hands and brains, take state, county, and commune agricultural tool factories as the backbone, focus on weeding tools, first popularize hand hoes, and launch a vigorous mass tool reform upsurge, creating, promoting, popularizing, and improving simultaneously. Through this year's field management, create and summarize a set of field management tools that are suitable for local use, easy to manufacture, and have high work efficiency. And actively create and manufacture various harvesting and threshing tools to prepare for the autumn harvest.

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    乘胜猛进，夺取田间管理工作全胜
    青海日报对加强春播作物的田间管理，发表了题为“乘胜猛进，夺取田间管理工作全胜”的社论。社论指出，当前农村压倒一切的中心任务，就是再接再厉，乘胜猛进，迅速掀起以除草为中心的田间管理高潮，大战6、
  7月，为夺取今年的更大丰收而奋斗。我们必须切实加强领导，全党全民大动员，用比垦荒播种更大的劲头来抓田间管理。继续采取分工负责、包干到底和深入田间、五级干部会师到田等领导方法，切实加强田间管理的领导；继续大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命，不断改进工具，提高劳动生产率。要下决心把大部劳力投入除草战斗。晚田作物播种尚未结束的地区，除了抽调一部分劳力，继续抢种晚田外，应该将主要力量，投入田间管理；播种结束的地区，应该集中一切力量搞好田间管理。6、7两月是田间管理的关键时刻，要求集中一切力量，大干、巧干两个月，夺取田间管理的全胜。保证川水地全部除草三遍，山地和新垦荒地力争除草两遍，并作到适时适量浇水、追肥，及时防治雹、洪、霜、冻、病、虫等灾害，实现多种多收、高产多收。
    社论指出，劳力不足，是田间管理的主要困难，解决这一问题的主要途径，一方面是不断改进劳动组织和劳动管理，另一方面就是大搞技术革新和技术革命，迅速创造和推广各种新式农具和改良农具。要进一步健全劳动组织，合理安排基本建设、副业、社办工业的劳力，在6、7两月田间管理大忙期间，应保证80％以上的劳力投入田间管理。基本建设劳力应该适当控制，在大忙时，也可以临时抽调工业、副业和基本建设的劳力突击除草。要根据田间管理的需要，建立专业队，实行专田、专人、专责，包任务、包质量、包时间，三包到底。特别对丰产方和三类苗要加强管理，加工、加水、加肥，保证三类苗不过分蘖关。根据等价交换的原则，广泛开展山川、场社和队与队之间的大协作，集中优势兵力，突击薄弱环节。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，迅速创造、推广各种新式和改良农具，是解决劳力不足的最有效途径，也是多快好省地搞好田间管理的唯一正确道路。要进一步大做宣传、大造声势，深入发动群众，人人动手，个个动脑，以州、县、公社农具厂为骨干，以除草工具为中心，首先普及手锄，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众性工具改革高潮，边创造、边推广、边普及、边提高，通过今年田间管理，创造和总结出一套适合当地使用的、制造容易、工效高的田间管理工具。并且积极创造和制造各种收割、脱粒工具，为秋收做好准备。
