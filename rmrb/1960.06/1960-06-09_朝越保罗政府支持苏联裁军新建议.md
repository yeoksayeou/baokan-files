The North Korean government's statement points out: Only when the people of the world unite and wage a tenacious struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression, expose and smash its conspiracies of war provocation, can world peace be maintained and consolidated. The U.S. imperialists must withdraw their aggressive troops from South Korea, as well as Asia, Africa, Europe and all other regions, and dismantle their military bases.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 8th. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 7th, supporting the new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government on June 2nd.

The statement said: "The Soviet government has made consistent and sincere efforts for disarmament and consolidation of world peace. However, the Western powers, headed by U.S. imperialism, have rejected all reasonable and realistic proposals of the Soviet government, using empty talk about 'peace' and 'negotiation' to deceive the people, and continue to carry out aggressive and provocative conspiracies."

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism recently carried out a robber-like aggressive act against Soviet airspace, sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, revived militarism in Japan and West Germany, created various aggressive military blocs, increased aggressive military bases in foreign countries, and continued to prepare for a new war against the people of the world and socialist countries. In South Korea, U.S. imperialists violated the armistice agreement by transporting large quantities of new weapons, including missiles, and frequently conducted atomic maneuver exercises near the military demarcation line, turning South Korea into a base for nuclear war. U.S. imperialists have turned South Korea into a colony, plunged the people into hunger and poverty, and brutally suppressed the South Korean people who are struggling for freedom, democracy and the right to survive.

The statement emphasized: "All these facts prove that the people of the world must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the imperialists and must wage a thorough struggle against the imperialists' provocative conspiracies. Only when the people of the world unite their forces and wage a tenacious struggle against the imperialists' policy of aggression, expose and smash its war provocation conspiracies, can the international tension be eased and world peace be maintained and consolidated.

The statement pointed out, "The Soviet government, taking into account some of the views expressed by Western countries during the disarmament conference, has put forward a new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, bringing the possibility of progress to the stalled Geneva Disarmament Conference."

The statement said that now all peace-loving people in the world are watching the attitude of the Western powers towards the new Soviet proposal.

The statement pointed out, "The Western countries headed by U.S. imperialists must abandon empty talk and accept the Soviet proposal in practice. The U.S. imperialists must withdraw their aggressive troops from South Korea, as well as Asia, Africa, Europe and all other regions, and dismantle their military bases."

The statement concluded, "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people will continue to wage a tenacious struggle against the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism and to defend peace in the Far East and the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 7th. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, expressing its support for the new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists sabotaged the recent Four-Power Summit Conference in Paris, which once again proves that in the face of the Soviet Union's efforts to promote a peaceful solution to major international issues, the U.S. imperialists have repeatedly and blatantly created new obstacles to undermine peace. The statement said that all governments and people in the world who are sincerely committed to peace must resolutely hold back the claws of the U.S. imperialist warmongers and their lackeys and severely condemn any of their provocations and aggressive conspiracies.

The statement said, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people firmly believe that the Soviet government's new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament will receive enthusiastic support from peace-loving governments and people around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 7th. According to a report by the Bulgarian News Agency tonight, the Bulgarian government issued a statement expressing its full support for the new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet government.

The statement said that events in recent months have shown that although Western countries have issued statements saying that they welcome the principle of complete and thorough disarmament, they have put forward various reservations and objections, which in fact are intended to undermine the Soviet disarmament measures.

The statement pointed out that the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches great importance to the fact that the Soviet Union, which has an indisputable advantage in rocket weapons, has expressed its willingness to start disarmament by destroying rocket weapons first under the condition that military bases on the territory of other countries are dismantled at the same time as the rocket weapons are destroyed. This is new evidence that the Soviet government is determined to get the world out of the dead end created by Western countries and truly move forward along the road of complete and thorough disarmament.

The statement said that the People's Republic of Bulgaria hopes that the reconvened Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will take the Soviet Union's new proposal most seriously.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 8th. Newspapers here reported today that the Romanian Council of Ministers issued a communiqué fully supporting the Soviet government's new disarmament proposal.

The communiqué said that the Romanian Council of Ministers received a letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev on June 2 and studied the Soviet government's basic proposals for a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. The Romanian Council of Ministers decided to fully support the Soviet government's new proposal and has given corresponding instructions to the Romanian delegation participating in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference.

    朝越保罗政府支持苏联裁军新建议
    朝鲜政府声明指出：只有全世界人民团结起来，为反对帝国主义的侵略政策进行顽强斗争，揭露和粉碎它的战争挑衅阴谋，才能维护和巩固世界和平。美帝国主义者必须从南朝鲜以及亚洲、非洲、欧洲和其他一切地区撤走它的侵略军，撤除它的军事基地。
    新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府7日发表声明，支持苏联政府6月2日提出的关于全面彻底裁军的新建议。
    声明说：“苏联政府为裁军和巩固世界和平，作了始终一贯的真诚努力。但是，以美帝国主义为首的西方大国拒绝了苏联政府的一切合理的、现实的建议，以空谈‘和平’和‘谈判’来欺骗人民，继续进行侵略性的挑衅阴谋活动。”
    声明指出，美帝国主义最近对苏联领空进行了强盗般的侵略行动，破坏了四国首脑会议，在日本和西德复活军国主义，制造各种侵略性军事集团，在外国增设侵略性军事基地，继续准备进行反对全世界人民和社会主义国家的新战争。在南朝鲜，美帝国主义者违反停战协定，大量运进导弹等各种新式武器，频繁地在军事分界线附近进行原子机动演习，使南朝鲜变成核战争的基地。美帝国主义者使南朝鲜变成了殖民地，使人民陷入饥饿和贫苦中，并残酷地镇压为争取自由、民主和生存权利而进行斗争的南朝鲜人民。
    声明强调指出：“这一切事实证明，全世界人民对帝国主义者必须经常保持高度的警惕，必须为反对帝国主义者的挑衅性阴谋活动进行彻底的斗争。只有全世界人民把力量团结起来，为反对帝国主义者的侵略政策进行顽强的斗争，揭露和粉碎它的战争挑衅阴谋，才能缓和国际紧张局势，才能维护和巩固世界和平。
    声明指出，“苏联政府考虑了西方国家在裁军会议过程中表明的一部分见解，提出了关于全面彻底裁军的新建议，为陷入停顿状态的日内瓦裁军会议带来了前进的可能性。
    声明说，现在全世界爱好和平的人民都注视着西方大国对待苏联政府的新建议的态度。
    声明指出，“以美帝国主义者为首的西方国家必须抛弃空谈，以实际行动来接受苏联的这次建议。美帝国主义者必须从南朝鲜以及亚洲、非洲、欧洲以及其他一切地区撤走它的侵略军，撤除它的军事基地。”
    声明最后说，“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民将为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，为保卫远东和世界和平继续展开顽强的斗争。”
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明，表示支持苏联提出的关于全面彻底裁军问题的新建议。
    声明指出，美帝国主义破坏了最近在巴黎召开的四国首脑会议，这再一次证明了面对苏联为促进和平解决国际重大问题作出的努力，美帝国主义再三明目张胆地制造新的障碍来破坏和平。声明说，世界所有对和平具有诚意的各国政府和人民，必须坚决地扼住美帝国主义好战分子及其走狗的魔掌，严厉谴责它们的任何挑衅和侵略阴谋。
    声明说，“越南民主共和国政府和越南人民坚信，苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的新建议将会获得世界上爱好和平的各国政府和人民的热烈支持。
  新华社索非亚7日电　据保加利亚通讯社今晚报道：保加利亚政府发表声明，表示完全支持苏联政府提出的裁军新建议。
    声明说，最近几个月的事件表明，西方国家虽然发表声明，说它们原则上欢迎全面彻底裁军主张，然而却提出了种种保留和异议，这些保留和异议实际上是要破坏苏联的裁军措施。
    声明指出，保加利亚人民共和国政府非常重视这一事实：在火箭武器方面具有无可争辩的优势的苏联，表示愿意在这样的条件下先从销毁火箭武器开始裁军，这个条件就是：在销毁火箭武器的同时，撤除在别国领土上的军事基地。这是一个新的证据，证明苏联政府决心要使世界摆脱西方国家造成的死胡同，真正沿着全面彻底裁军的道路前进。
    声明说，保加利亚人民共和国希望现在复会的十国裁军委员会将能最严肃地对待苏联的新建议。
    新华社布加勒斯特8日电　这里的报纸今天报道，罗马尼亚部长会议发表公报完全支持苏联政府的新裁军建议。
    公报说，罗马尼亚部长会议接到了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫6月2日的信，并研究了苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军条约基本建议。罗马尼亚部长会议决定完全支持苏联政府的新建议，并已给参加十国裁军会议的罗马尼亚代表团作了相应的指示。
