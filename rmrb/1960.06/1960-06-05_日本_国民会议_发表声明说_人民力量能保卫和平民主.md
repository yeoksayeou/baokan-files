The Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement today regarding the general strike, pointing out: Today's unified movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a great victory. The statement emphasized continuing the struggle more vigorously.

The statement said that the actions taken in an organized manner today throughout Japan shattered all conspiracies by the police, right-wing elements, and Liberal Democratic Party members to provoke conflict, and issued the strongest warning to Nobusuke Kishi.

The statement pointed out that today's struggle once again proves that the power of the people can defend peace and democracy.

The statement said that all Japanese people will intensify the struggle to achieve their goals—overthrowing the Kishi cabinet, dissolving the Diet, and abolishing the revised "Security Treaty."

The National Council solemnly declared in the statement: "If the Kishi government dares to take repressive measures against the people's movement, all Japanese people will rise up to crush this attempt."

The Japan National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union also issued statements regarding the general strike, saying that this general strike "is proof of the people's demand for the Kishi cabinet's collective resignation and the dissolution of the Diet."
