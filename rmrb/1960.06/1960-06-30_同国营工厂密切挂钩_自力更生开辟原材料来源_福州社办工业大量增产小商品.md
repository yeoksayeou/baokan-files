　　Closely Linked with State-Owned Factories, Self-Reliance Opens Up Sources of Raw Materials
　　Fuzhou Community-Run Industries Greatly Increase Production of Small Commodities

　　(Our report) Fuzhou City is giving full play to the power of industries run by urban people's communes and street residents, developing the production of small commodities such as daily-use small general merchandise, small hardware, and daily-use groceries, which has not only powerfully supported the market but also promoted the consolidation and development of these community-run and street-run industries. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, the city now has more than a quarter more varieties of major small commodities than in the same period last year, and the output and supply of seasonal small commodities are generally one to four or five times higher than in the same period last year.

　　The number of factories and employees in Fuzhou's existing community-run and street-run industries has more than doubled compared to the beginning of this year. They can produce more than 2,000 kinds of large and small commodities, and the total output value in May increased more than seventy times compared to January. The Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has established small commodity production leading groups and offices at all levels throughout the city to strengthen leadership over community-run industries and small commodity production. These institutions, on the one hand, organize community-run and street-run industries to link up with state-owned factories and directly serve them. On the other hand, based on market needs, the production capacity of community-run and street-run industries, and the sources of raw materials, they uniformly organize various forces to carry out the production of small commodities that are not included in the state plan in a planned manner, and implement hierarchical management, conducting inspections and comparisons on a ten-day and monthly basis, grasping both output and variety, so that the production of small commodities can meet market needs.

　　Community-run street-run and local state-owned industries, according to the principle of "self-reliance as the main factor, state allocation as a supplement," adopt methods such as fully utilizing side materials, scraps, and waste materials, practicing economy and substitution, and comprehensive utilization, to self-reliantly open up sources of raw materials and materials, ensuring the continuous development of small commodity production. The Decorations Factory of Chating Commune uses waste materials such as glass scraps and iron and steel shavings left over from the production of large factories of glass jars and enamelware as raw materials to process and manufacture 190 kinds of small commodities such as hair clips, buttons, and shoe eyelets. In more than 20 days, they produced more than 5,000 packets of hair clips, more than 10,000 boxes of various buttons, and more than 2,000 dozens of face powder.

　　Community-run and street-run industries also adopt methods such as self-reliance and having large factories help small factories manufacture equipment and train technicians to carry out small commodity production technical innovation and technical revolution, continuously improving product output and quality. After basically realizing production mechanization and semi-mechanization, the city's bamboo and wood industry has not only improved the utilization rate of raw materials and saved a large amount of raw materials, but also increased output several times and greatly improved product quality. Fuzhou horn combs, a well-known daily-use handicraft product at home and abroad, have been transformed from manual operation to mechanical production by more than 700 manual workers who self-reliantly and using indigenous methods, combined native and foreign methods, and successively created 20 kinds of machines such as electric horn sawing machines, tooth sawing machines, and polishing machines, which has not only freed comb-making workers from heavy and cumbersome labor, but also increased production efficiency by half to four times respectively.

    同国营工厂密切挂钩　自力更生开辟原材料来源
    福州社办工业大量增产小商品
    本报讯　福州市充分发挥城市人民公社和街道居民办的工业的力量，发展日用小百货、小五金和日用杂货等小商品生产，既有力支援了市场，也促进了这些社办街办工业的巩固发展。据有关部门初步统计，全市现有各种主要小商品品种比去年同期增加四分之一以上，其中当令小商品的产量和供应数量，一般比去年同期增加一倍到四、五倍。
    福州市现有社办街办工业的厂数和职工人数都比今年年初增加一倍以上，能生产各种大小商品两千种以上，5月份总产值比1月份猛增七十多倍。中共福州市委在全市层层成立了小商品生产领导小组和办公室，加强对社办工业和小商品生产的领导。这些机构一面组织社办街办工业和国营工厂挂钩直接为国营工厂服务，一面根据市场需要，社办街办工业的生产能力和原材料来源等情况，把那些不列入国家计划的小商品，统一组织各方面力量有计划地进行生产，并且实行分级管理，按旬按月检查评比，既抓产量，又抓品种，使小商品的生产能够适应市场需要。
    社办街办和地方国营工业根据
  “自力更生为主、国家调拨为辅”的原则，采取充分利用边材、下脚料和废料，实行节约代用和综合利用等办法，自力更生大力开辟原料材料来源，保证小商品生产不断发展。茶亭公社装饰品厂在利用玻璃罐头搪瓷等大厂生产剩下的玻璃碎屑、铁边、钢屑等废料作原料，加工制造发夹、扣子、鞋眼等小商品一百九十种，二十多天共生产了发夹五千多罗、各种钮扣一万多盒，香粉两千多打。
    社办街办工业还采取自力更生和由大厂帮小厂制造设备、代训技工等办法，大搞小商品生产技术革新和技术革命，不断提高产品产量和质量。全市竹木器行业在基本实现了生产机械化半机械化以后，不仅提高了原材料利用率，节约了大量原材料，产量也成倍增加，产品质量大提高。名闻中外的日用手工艺品——福州角梳，经过七百多个手工工人自力更生土法上马土洋结合，先后创造成功电动锯角机、锯齿机、磨光机等二十种机械，变手工操作为机械生产，不仅使造梳工人摆脱了笨重和繁琐的劳动，同时生产效率也分别提高了半倍到四倍。（附图片）
