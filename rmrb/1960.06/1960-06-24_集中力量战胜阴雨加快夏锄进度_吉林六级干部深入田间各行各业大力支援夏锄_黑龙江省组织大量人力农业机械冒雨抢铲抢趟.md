Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Jilin Province's 180,000 cadres, from the province to the commune production teams (at six levels), have converged on the fields, leading commune members in rushing to shovel and till. They are making every effort to overcome unfavorable conditions such as excessive rain, insufficient sunshine, and low temperatures, to promote normal crop growth. To date, more than 42.6 million mu of autumn crops across the province have undergone the first round of shoveling and tilling, with some areas having basically completed the first round.

Jilin Province has a lot of land and little labor. Summer hoeing has always been the most intense farm work. Even a slight delay could lead to abandonment of fields. Especially since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain and low temperatures across the province have caused late seedling emergence and slow development of crops, and have made it difficult to cultivate and weed. In response to this situation, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the people of the province to carry forward their fighting spirit, seize the time, and launch a concentrated summer hoeing campaign. On the 18th, Zhao Lin, Li Diping, Fu Zhensheng, Li Youwen, Yu Yifu, and other secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, again led more than 2,000 cadres from provincial-level agencies to the front lines of summer hoeing, joining the vast numbers of commune members in advancing on the weeds in the fields. The Provincial Party Committee's call and the presence of the Provincial Party Committee's leading cadres on the front lines further promoted the development of the six-level cadres' field battle across the province. Party organizations at all levels are led by the First Secretary, with committee members dividing up responsibilities, leading commune members in a concentrated summer hoeing effort. At the same time, organs, organizations, enterprises, schools, and urban street residents are also vigorously supporting summer hoeing production with the same enthusiasm as they supported the fight against drought in 1958. Currently, the number of staff and workers from organs and enterprises, officers and soldiers from the army, and teachers and students from schools participating in summer hoeing has reached over 540,000.

The convergence of six-level cadres in the fields and the vigorous support of the vast numbers of workers, students, and soldiers for summer hoeing has greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the vast numbers of commune members. The number of people participating in summer hoeing across the province has increased by 1.7 times compared to the end of May, and the speed of shoveling and tilling has more than doubled. Various localities have universally promoted the method of "shoveling emerging sprouts" (shoveling once before the seedlings emerge from the soil) and tilling a plow before shoveling, solving the contradiction that early shoveling and tilling could not be carried out due to late seedling emergence and slow seedling growth.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Rural areas in Heilongjiang Province are concentrating superior forces to organize three summer hoeing campaigns from mid-June to mid-July, determined to fight this battle which is decisive for this year's agricultural production. Now the first campaign has ended, and the second campaign has begun. Counties such as Zhaozhou, Shuangcheng, Longjiang, and Bayan in the western and central regions have completed the first round of shoveling and tilling and have begun the second round.

Since the spring of this year, Heilongjiang Province has experienced continuous rain, and the temperature has been about three degrees lower than in previous years. Weeds and seedlings have grown together in the fields. In some areas, the weeds are even taller than the seedlings. Especially this year, with the implementation of small ridge close planting in various localities, the summer hoeing workload has increased by about one time compared with previous years. In order to overcome continuous rain and win a bumper harvest, more than 100,000 cadres across the province, leading more than 2 million male and female commune members, are concentrating a large number of mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved agricultural implements, braving the rain to rush to shovel and till in the fields. Wherever shoveling and tilling has been done, the seedlings are growing particularly fast. Early-sown spring wheat has already covered the ridges, and corn, sorghum, and soybeans are also growing robustly and neatly.

In Mudanjiang, the eastern region with the most rainfall, methods such as digging drainage ditches and water storage pits have been adopted before shoveling and tilling to drain water from farmland. Now, of the more than 4.3 million mu of cultivated land affected by waterlogging, 2.5 million mu have had standing water drained, and efforts are being organized to rush to shovel and till.

During the summer hoeing campaign, the First Secretaries of Party committees at all levels took the lead in going deep into the front lines of production, eating, living, and working with the commune members, grasping both production and life, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses. In Baiquan County, led by Xu Yuelin, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, more than 4,000 cadres were organized to go to the countryside to lead summer hoeing. The daily progress of shoveling and tilling in the county increased from the original 70,000 mu to more than 450,000 mu. In order to strengthen specific leadership, Wangkui County transferred 293 cadres with rural work experience to serve as deputy captains in weak production teams. In Zhaozhou County, due to the good work in public canteens and other collective living welfare, it was ensured that the commune members ate their fill and had good food during the intense summer hoeing, had both work and rest, were single-minded and had no worries, and that more than 10,000 women and semi-able-bodied laborers also participated in summer hoeing production.

The more than 270,000 pieces of mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved agricultural implements used in Heilongjiang Province this year's summer hoeing have exerted tremendous power. These new tools can shovel and till at the same time, greatly improving the efficiency of summer hoeing. In Zhaozhou County, due to the promotion of various new types of cultivating tools, 500,000 laborers were saved in the first round of shoveling and tilling.

    集中力量战胜阴雨加快夏锄进度
    吉林六级干部深入田间各行各业大力支援夏锄
    黑龙江省组织大量人力农业机械冒雨抢铲抢趟
    据新华社讯　吉林省由省到公社生产队的六级干部十八万人，会师田间，领导社员抢铲抢趟，千方百计地战胜阴雨多、日照少、气温低等不利条件，促使农作物正常生育。到目前为止，全省已有四千二百六十多万亩大秋作物进行了头遍铲趟，部分地区头遍铲趟工作已经基本结束。
    吉林省土地多，劳力少，夏锄向来是最紧张的农活，稍一迟缓，就有可能撂荒。特别是今年入夏以来，全省各地阴雨连绵，气温很低，恶劣的气候条件，使农作物出苗晚，发育慢；而且给中耕锄草带来困难。根据这种情况，中共吉林省委号召全省人民发扬斗志，抓紧时间，突击铲趟。18日，省委书记处书记赵林、李砥平、富振声、栗又文、于毅夫等，又分别率领二千多名省直属机关干部分赴夏锄生产第一线，同广大社员一道向田间杂草进军。省委的号召和省委领导干部的亲临第一线，进一步促进了全省六级干部田间大会战的发展。各级党组织都由第一书记挂帅，委员分片包干，领导社员突击夏锄。同时，机关、团体、企业、学校和城市街道居民，也以1958年支援抗旱的劲头，大力支援夏锄生产。现在全省机关企业职工、部队官兵和学校师生参加夏锄的人数已达五十四万以上。
    六级干部会师田间和广大职工、学生、战士的大力支援夏锄，大大鼓舞了广大社员的劳动积极性。全省参加夏锄人数已比5月末增加一点七倍，铲趟进度加快了一倍多。各地普遍推行了“铲萌生”
  （禾苗出土前铲一遍）和铲前趟一犁的办法，解决了因幼苗出土晚、禾苗生长慢而不能提早铲趟的矛盾。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省各地农村集中优势力量，从6月中旬到7月中旬组织三个夏锄战役，决心打好对今年农业生产具有决定意义的这一仗。现在第一个战役已经结束，第二个战役开始，西部和中部地区的肇州、双城、龙江、巴彦等县已完成头遍铲趟，开始第二遍铲趟。
    今年春季以来，黑龙江省雨水连绵，气温比往年低三度左右，田里草苗齐长，有些地区甚至草比苗高。特别是今年各地实行小垅密植，夏锄工作量比往年增加一倍左右。为了战胜连阴雨，夺取丰收，全省已有十万干部，带领二百多万男女社员，集中大量机械化、半机械化农具和改良农具，冒雨在田间抢铲抢趟。凡是铲趟过的地，禾苗长得特别快，早下种的春小麦已经罩垅，苞米、高粱、大豆等也都长得茁壮整齐。
    在降雨最多的东部牡丹江各地，铲趟前都采取挖顺水壕、挖蓄水坑等方法为农田排涝。现在受内涝的四百三十多万亩耕地，已有二百五十万亩排出积水，正在组织人力抢铲抢趟。
    在夏锄战役中，各级党委第一书记都带头深入生产第一线，和社员同吃同住同劳动，既抓生产，又抓生活，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。拜泉县以县委第一书记徐悦林为首，组织了四千多名干部下乡领导夏锄，全县铲趟日进度由原来的七万亩增加到了四十五万多亩。望奎县为了加强具体领导，抽调了二百九十三名有农村工作经验的干部到薄弱生产队担任副队长。肇州县由于公共食堂等集体生活福利抓得好，保证了社员们在紧张的夏锄中吃得饱，吃得好，有劳有逸，一心无挂，并且使一万多名妇女和半劳动力也参加了夏锄生产。
    黑龙江省今年夏锄中使用的二十七万多台（件）机械化、半机械化和改良农具，发挥了巨大威力。这些新工具都能随铲随趟，使夏锄工效大大提高。肇州县由于推广了各种新式中耕工具，在头遍铲趟中就节省了五十万个劳动力。
