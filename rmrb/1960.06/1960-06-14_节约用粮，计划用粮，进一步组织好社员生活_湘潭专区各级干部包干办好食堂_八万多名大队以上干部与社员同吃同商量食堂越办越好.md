Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 13th - More than 80,000 cadres at the brigade level and above in Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province, have gone deep into rural public canteens, adopting the "Four Guarantees" method: guaranteeing grain saving, planning grain use, guaranteeing good meals, guaranteeing the implementation of grain management systems, and guaranteeing the rapid achievement of the "Five-Good" canteen standard. This has made the rural people's commune canteens throughout the prefecture better and better. Now, the number of "Five-Good" canteens in the prefecture has surged from the original 53% to over 70%, and the number of third-class canteens has dropped from the original 10% to 4%. The remaining 20% or so of the canteens have also reached the "Four-Good" or "Three-Good" standards.

Since the establishment of rural public canteens in this prefecture a year ago, the principle of "actively running well and voluntary participation" has been adhered to, further organizing and arranging the lives of commune members, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.

Since the beginning of this year, in order to further improve the canteens, the Xiangtan Prefectural Party Committee has had cadres at all levels go deep into the canteens, enter the kitchens, and serve as cooks and managers, vigorously running "Five-Good" canteens. At the end of April, in order to ensure that all rural canteens in the district reach the following standards during the summer harvest: planned grain use, economical grain use, everyone eats their fill, eats economically, and eats well; firewood and vegetables are sufficient, oil, salt, and money are self-sufficient, pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish are raised well; cooking utensils are innovated, saving manpower and materials well; cleanliness and hygiene, prevention of diseases, and good health for commune members; democratic management, sound systems, convenience for commune members, unity and friendship, etc., the prefectural committee decided that each county should have the first secretary of the county party committee take the lead in grasping life. In addition to the general establishment of canteen management committees in public canteens to implement democratic management, it was also required that each cadre working in rural areas should contract to run one or two canteens well. This call was immediately supported by the majority of cadres and the masses. Now, more than 80,000 cadres at the brigade level and above in the prefecture have carried out the "Four Guarantees" for 45% of the public canteens. Among these cadres, there are more than 100 members of the county party committee and more than 1,600 secretaries and members of the commune party committee. Wang Zhiguo, first secretary of the prefectural party committee, and Zhao Chuqi, secretary, went to the Weixing Canteen in Shaoshan Commune and the Bingquan Canteen in Guandu Commune in Liuyang, respectively, to live with commune members and study ways to further improve the canteens. After Li Xueliang, first secretary of the Ningxiang County Party Committee, arrived at the Caomenwu Canteen in Xiaduopu Commune, he went to the kitchen to study cooking techniques with the cooks, went to the vegetable fields to study vegetable production with the vegetable growers, and went to the accounting room to study ways to improve the canteen with the managers, which quickly turned this backward canteen into a "Five-Good" canteen.

During the "Four Guarantees" for public canteens in various places, special attention was also paid to helping canteens develop sideline production. Many canteens are actively planting vegetables, raising pigs, raising chickens, raising ducks, raising fish, raising bees, and raising sheep. After the cadres carried out the "Four Guarantees" for more than 400 backward canteens in Yueyang County, they rushed to plant more than 6,000 mu of vegetables and increased the breeding of more than 1,500 pigs and more than 5,000 domestic fowls. Due to the daily development of canteen sideline production, most of these more than 400 backward canteens have achieved self-sufficiency in oil, salt, vegetables, and management expenses.

Because cadres go deep into the canteens, eating, living, working, and discussing matters with commune members, cadres and the masses are united, the canteens are getting better and better, and commune members are full of energy, which has greatly promoted production. The 72 canteens of the Yongan Brigade of the Liuyang Yongan Commune have good grain arrangements, sufficient vegetables, and fragrant rice, and the commune members' enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher.

    节约用粮，计划用粮，进一步组织好社员生活
    湘潭专区各级干部包干办好食堂
    八万多名大队以上干部与社员同吃同商量食堂越办越好
    新华社长沙13日电　湖南省湘潭专区八万多名大队以上干部，深入农村公共食堂，采取包节约用粮、计划用粮，包吃饭吃好，包粮食管理制度的执行，包尽快达到“五好”食堂标准的“四包”办法，使全专区农村人民公社食堂越办越好。现在，全专区“五好”食堂由原来53％猛增到70％以上，三类食堂由原来的10％下降到4％。其余20％多的食堂也都达到了“四好”或“三好”标准。
    这个专区的农村公共食堂兴办一年以来，由于坚持了“积极办好，自愿参加”的方针，进一步组织与安排好社员生活，大大鼓舞了广大群众的干劲。
    今年以来，湘潭地委为了进一步把食堂办好，各级干部纷纷深入食堂，进厨房，当炊事员、管理员，大办“五好”食堂。4月下旬，地委为了使全区的农村食堂在夏收中都达到：计划用粮、节约用粮，人人吃得饱，吃得省，吃得好；柴菜满足，油盐钱自给，猪鸡鸭鱼养得好；炊具革新，节省人力物力好；清洁卫生，防止疾病，社员身体好；民主管理，制度健全，方便社员，团结友爱等“五好”标准，决定各县由县委第一书记挂帅抓生活，公共食堂普遍建立食堂管理委员会实行民主管理外，并要求在农村工作的每个干部都包干办好一、两个食堂。这一号召，立即得到广大干部和群众的拥护。现在，全专区农村大队以上的八万多个干部，已对45％的公共食堂进行了“四包”，这些干部中，有县委委员一百多人，公社党委书记、党委委员一千六百多人，地委第一书记王治国、书记赵处祺分别到韶山公社卫星食堂和浏阳官渡公社兵泉食堂，和社员共同生活，研究进一步办好食堂的办法。宁乡县委第一书记李学良到夏铎铺公社的槽门屋食堂后，即到厨房与炊事员研究烹调技术，到菜地和种菜员研究蔬菜的生产，进账房与管理员研究办好食堂的办法，使这个后进食堂很快变成了“五好”食堂。
    各地对公共食堂进行“四包”中，还特别注意了帮助食堂发展副业生产。许多食堂正积极种菜、养猪、养鸡、养鸭、养鱼、养蜂、养羊等。岳阳县四百多个后进食堂在干部进行“四包”后，即突击种下了六千多亩蔬菜，增养了一千五百多头猪、五千多只家禽。由于食堂副业生产一天天发展，这四百多个后进食堂中绝大部分已实现油盐、蔬菜和管理费用三自给。
    由于干部深入食堂，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，干群打成一片，食堂越办越好，社员个个干劲冲天，对生产起了很大的推动作用。浏阳永安公社永安大队七十二个食堂粮食安排好，菜足饭香，社员生产劲头越来越高。
