Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a speech at a meeting held by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce on the 19th.

Chen Shutong said, after the "God of Plague" Eisenhower sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, he came to the Far East to play tricks of false peace and real war, creating tension in the Far East. His sinful activities have aroused a tidal wave of anti-American anger from the people of Asian countries. The Filipino people threw stones at his car, giving him a setback on the first stop of his "visit" to the Far East; the broad masses of patriotic people in Japan did not approve his "visit" to Japan, giving him the cold shoulder. This number one war monger also went to Taiwan, our sacred territory, to carry out rampant war provocations and threats against our people, and conspired to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to turn Taiwan into a colony of the United States. However, the Chinese people know how to teach the "God of Plague" a lesson. The People's Liberation Army on our Fujian front bombarded with thousands of cannons, representing the strong will of our 650 million people to resolutely fight back against the American aggressors, expressing the contempt and disdain of our people for Eisenhower.

He said that Taiwan, under the occupation of American imperialism, has become a living hell. American aggressors run rampant in Taiwan, committing murder, arson, rape, and plunder, with countless crimes. Taking Taiwan's industrial and commercial circles as an example, under the intrusion of American capital and the dumping of goods, they have been squeezed out and devastated, with factories and shops closing down in large numbers and forced into bankruptcy. Recalling before liberation, the industrialists and businessmen in our mainland also suffered the same devastation and plunder by American imperialism, which is still fresh in our memory, and today the same experience is still being imposed on the industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan. We have deep concern and sympathy for the tragic situation of our compatriots in Taiwan today; we express the greatest anger at the countless bloody atrocities of the American aggressors and will carry out a resolute struggle. Eisenhower's sinister attempt to create "two Chinas" and continue to enslave our Taiwan compatriots will never succeed. Taiwan is our sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan and bring Taiwan back to the big family of our beloved motherland.

Chen Shutong said that we love peace, but if we do not resolutely struggle against the "God of Plague" Eisenhower, who undermines peace, we will not be able to obtain peace. We have the strength to defend peace. We have 650 million united people and a strong socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. If American imperialism dares to invade, we will completely eliminate it from the earth.

Chen Shutong finally said that we Chinese industrialists and businessmen, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will definitely stand together with the people of the whole country, the whole of Asia, and the peace-loving people of the world to wage the most resolute struggle against American imperialism and give it the heaviest counterblow.

    陈叔通在全国工商联和北京市工商联集会上讲话
    最沉重的回击美国侵略者
    新华社19日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，19日在全国工商业联合会和北京市工商业联合会举行的集会上发表谈话。
    陈叔通说，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔在破坏了四国首脑会议之后，又到远东来玩弄假和平、真备战的伎俩，制造远东紧张局势。他的罪恶活动，激起了亚洲各国人民排山倒海的反美怒潮。菲律宾人民对他的汽车投掷石块，使他在“访问”远东的第一站就碰了壁；日本广大的爱国群众不批准他的“访”日计划，给他吃了闭门羹。这个头号战争贩子，又到我国神圣领土台湾，对我国人民进行猖狂的战争挑衅和威胁，阴谋制造“两个中国”妄图把台湾变为美国的殖民地。但是，中国人民是知道怎样教训“瘟神”的。我福建前线部队万炮轰击，代表了我国六亿五千万人民坚决回击美国侵略者的强大意志，表示了我国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。
    他说，台湾在美帝国主义的霸占下，成了一个人间地狱。美国侵略者在台湾横行霸道，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，罪行累累。仅就台湾的工商界来说，在美国资本的侵入和商品的倾销下，被排挤、被摧残，工厂、商店成批倒闭，被迫破产。回忆解放以前，我国大陆上的工商业者也曾受过美帝国主义同样的摧残和掠夺，记忆犹新，而今天同样的遭遇仍强加在台湾工商业者的头上。对于台湾同胞今天的悲惨处境，我们怀着深切的关怀和同情；对于美国侵略者罄竹难书的血腥暴行，我们表示最大的愤怒并进行坚决的斗争。艾森豪威尔阴谋制造“两个中国”，继续奴役我台湾同胞的强盗打算，是永远不能得逞的。台湾是我国的神圣领土，我们一定要解放台湾，使台湾回到亲爱的祖国大家庭来。
    陈叔通说，我们爱好和平，但是对破坏和平的“瘟神”艾森豪威尔，如果不同他坚决斗争，我们就得不到和平。我们是有力量保卫和平的。我们有六亿五千万团结一致的人民，有以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营，美帝国主义胆敢侵犯，我们就把它从地球上彻底消灭。
    陈叔通最后说，我们中国工商业者，在中国共产党的领导下，一定和全国、全亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，对美帝国主义作最坚决的斗争，给它以最沉重的回击。
