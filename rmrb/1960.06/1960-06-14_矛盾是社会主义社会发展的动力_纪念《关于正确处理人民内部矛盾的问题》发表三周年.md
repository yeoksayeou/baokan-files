    Contradiction is the Driving Force of Socialist Society's Development
    -- Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"
   Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Class society has class struggle, and there are antagonistic contradictions between hostile classes. This contradiction is the driving force for social progress. This is generally understood by those who believe in Marxism-Leninism. However, after the victory of the socialist revolution, after the reactionary ruling class's regime is overthrown and the social system of man exploiting man is eliminated, do contradictions still exist within society internally? Do contradictions still persist within the people? Are there still contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base? Even if contradictions still exist, are these contradictions the driving force for social progress? These issues have become highly inconsistent in people's understanding. Some people do not believe that in human society, besides the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, there are also contradictions among the people; some even believe that in the so-called atomic age, the boundaries between ourselves and the enemy can be blurred, and cats and mice can sleep together, with no contradictions at all. Some people do not believe that in socialist society, there are mutually contradictory aspects between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, in addition to the mutually adaptive aspects; some even believe that within socialist society, there are neither unadaptable contradictions, nor is there a need to seek development from resolving contradictions and struggles; even if further development towards communism is desired, there is no need to undergo qualitative leaps or revolutionary transformations. As for the driving force of socialist society's development, some people believe that as long as technology develops, the productive forces develop, and the level of productivity reaches a certain level, there is no need to further adjust and improve certain aspects of the social system, and there is no need to rely on the broad masses to conduct revolutionary struggles on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, in order to enter communist society. In other words, there is no need to resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, and society can still move forward. Contradiction is no longer the driving force for the wheels of society to continue moving forward. They only acknowledge that socialist society is united and as solid as a rock, believing that this is the driving force of social development. These statements clearly violate the objective laws of social development and the Marxist-Leninist theories of continuous revolution and dialectical materialism. These erroneous statements will mislead the broad masses of people in socialist society. Acting according to these statements will cause socialist society to stagnate. This illustrates the importance of addressing the question of what is the driving force of socialist society's development today.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," published three years ago, outstandingly and creatively applied the Marxist-Leninist theory of the unity of opposites, solving the question of what is the driving force of socialist society's development for people living in this era of immense socialist transformation. It also solved a fundamental issue for the socialist period and even after entering communist society. Comrade Mao Zedong said in this great work:

    "Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law exists universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in people's thinking. Contradictory opposites are both united and in struggle, thereby driving the movement and change of things. Contradictions are universal, but the nature of contradictions varies according to the nature of things. For any specific thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, and transitional, and is therefore relative, while the struggle of opposites is absolute. Lenin explained this law very clearly. In our country, more and more people are understanding this law. However, for many people, acknowledging this law is one thing, and applying this law to observe and handle problems is another. Many people dare not openly admit that contradictions still exist among our people, and it is precisely these contradictions that are driving our society forward. Many people do not admit that there are still contradictions in socialist society, which makes them hesitant and passive in the face of social contradictions; they do not understand that in the process of continuously and correctly handling and resolving contradictions, the unity and solidarity within socialist society will be increasingly consolidated. Therefore, it is necessary to explain to our people, especially the cadres, to guide them to understand the contradictions in socialist society, and to understand the correct methods to handle these contradictions."

    This is a summary explanation of what the driving force of socialist society's development is.

    During the socialist construction period, contradictions among the people are becoming increasingly prominent. This is an ironclad fact that does not depend on people's will. It is necessary to discover contradictions in a timely manner, adopt correct methods to resolve them, and enable the socialist construction cause to develop at a high speed.

    In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong first tells us to face the objective reality squarely, to face the existence of contradictions among the people squarely, and never to cover up or evade these contradictions. Currently, in addition to opposing the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, which is essentially a class struggle against the world's large monopoly bourgeoisie, a struggle of the enemy, Chinese people also have two types of contradictions with different natures: one is the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, which is antagonistic; the other is the contradiction among the people. This type of contradiction is non-antagonistic among the working people, and between the exploited and the exploiting classes, there is a non-antagonistic aspect in addition to the antagonistic aspect. The existence of these two types of contradictions is due to the fact that our country still has two exploiting classes and two working classes. Two exploiting classes: one is the anti-socialist bourgeois rightists, the overthrown landlord-comprador class, and other reactionaries (including the slave owners in Tibet who betrayed the motherland); the bourgeois rightists are essentially the agents of imperialists, feudal comprador remnant forces, and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They are very isolated among the masses and are still disintegrating. The other is the national bourgeoisie and its intellectuals who are gradually accepting socialist transformation. They have made great progress in ideological transformation in recent years, but most of them have not completely shed their wavering transitional state between the socialist and capitalist roads. Two working classes: one is the peasants and other former individual laborers, the vast majority of whom have joined the rural and urban people's communes, and are increasingly becoming ardent supporters of socialism. One is the working class, the most advanced force among the people of the whole country, and the leading force of our national regime and socialist cause. These two exploiting classes and two working classes each have their own different worldviews. "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its own worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." This is the class and ideological basis for the two types of contradictions that currently exist domestically. The nationwide rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle launched in 1957 and 1958 were socialist revolutions on the political and ideological fronts in our country; the struggle against right-leaning opportunism in 1959 was a continuation of this struggle. These struggles vividly demonstrated the different interests and different standpoints of the two exploiting classes and two working classes, and also fully proved that during the socialist construction period, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, have always been the main contradictions within our country (this contradiction is the specific manifestation of the basic contradiction mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong in this work). This contradiction manifests itself in some areas as a fierce, life-and-death struggle between ourselves and the enemy, as the bourgeois rightists showed in their offensive in 1957. Although this offensive by the bourgeois rightists was repelled, they will still stir up trouble whenever they have the opportunity. Therefore, we must prepare for a long and repeated struggle against the bourgeois rightists in order to completely resolve their contradictions with the people. Our current struggle against the five categories of elements – landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists – all belong to the category of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy in nature. However, under the current specific conditions in our country, the contradictions between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and between the capitalist road and the socialist road, are mostly manifested as contradictions among the people. Some of these contradictions are between the national bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and some are contradictions within the proletariat caused by the influence of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie on some people. As for the contradictions between right and wrong, advanced and backward in understanding among the working people, some of them are related to the influence of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, but most of them do not belong to the contradictions between classes. This kind of contradiction exists extensively and universally within the people in socialist society, and will continue to exist even in communist society. Contradictions among the people did not only appear in socialist society, but after our country entered the socialist construction period, contradictions among the people became increasingly prominent and rose to an important position. This is an ironclad fact, an objective reality that does not depend on people's will. Whether you admit its existence or not, it exists; whether you deny its existence or not, it exists; if you want to erase it, you cannot erase it; if you want to cover it up, you cannot cover it up; if you want to avoid it, you cannot avoid it. If you try to erase, cover up, and avoid contradictions among the people, the contradictions will not only not be resolved, but will become more acute, and may even lead to the transformation of contradictions, turning non-antagonistic contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions, thereby hindering the smooth progress of the socialist cause. If we confuse contradictions among the people with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and fail to clearly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, we will make "left" or right leaning, line-based errors and dangers. Comrade Mao Zedong's attitude on this issue is exactly the opposite of the attitude mentioned above. Not only does he advocate facing the existence of contradictions among the people squarely and correctly distinguishing between the boundaries of contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but he also advocates actively exposing contradictions, actively adopting correct policies and methods, and proactively and promptly handling these contradictions, so that we can turn negative factors into positive factors, mobilize all positive factors, unite the people of the whole country, and fight for the great cause of socialist construction.

    In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong especially emphasized teaching us: On the basis of recognizing the contradictions among the people in socialist society, we must further grasp the laws of contradiction, actively use these laws to transform the world, and strive to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The characteristic of socialist society, as far as internal affairs are concerned, is that contradictions among the people have risen to an important position. Although contradictions among the people include the contradictions between the working class and other working people and the bourgeoisie, including the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, in addition to this, they also exist within the working people and within the working class. Generally speaking, contradictions among the people are questions of right and wrong among the people, and most of them are questions of right and wrong, advanced and backward, and are contradictions based on the fundamental unity of the interests of the people. This is a non-antagonistic contradiction that is different in nature from the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. This contradiction can be resolved by non-antagonistic forms of struggle (not reconciliation). If the leadership of the Party and the state can pay attention to discovering contradictions in a timely manner, and can proactively and promptly adopt correct policies and methods to resolve contradictions, then it can eliminate the resistance and disharmony that exist in all aspects, mobilize all positive factors, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and enable the socialist cause to develop at a high speed. Our Party has rich experience in resolving contradictions among the people. In decades of struggle, our Party has accumulated a complete set of methods for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Comrade Mao Zedong concretized this method into a formula called "unity -- criticism -- unity." To put it in more detail, it is to start from the desire for unity, and through criticism or struggle, resolve contradictions, thereby achieving new unity on a new basis. Experience has proven that this method is very successful. It can isolate the enemy to the greatest extent and strengthen ourselves to the greatest extent. In 1942, our Party adopted this method to resolve the contradictions between the dogmatists and the broad masses of Party members, and the contradictions between dogmatic ideology and Marxist ideology. After several years of effort, by the time the Communist Party of China convened its Seventh National Congress in 1945, it had indeed achieved the goal of unity of the whole Party, and thus achieved the great victory of the people's revolution. The application of this method outside the Party began in 1927. In 1927, our Party began to establish the army and revolutionary base areas in the south. Regarding the handling of relations between the Party and the masses, relations between the army and the people, and relations between officers and soldiers, this method was adopted. By the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party established this method on a more conscious basis. In the anti-Japanese base areas, the relations between leaders and the masses, the relations between the army and the people, the relations between officers and soldiers, the relations between different parts of the army, and the relations between different parts of the cadres, all adopted this method, and great success was achieved. After the national liberation, our Party also adopted the "unity -- criticism -- unity" method towards the democratic parties and the industrial and commercial circles, and also achieved great success. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "Our current task is to continue to promote and better use this method within the entire people, requiring all factories, cooperatives, shops, schools, organs, groups, in short, 600 million people, to use this method to resolve the contradictions within them." Comrade Mao Zedong's call was immediately enthusiastically responded to by the people of the whole country, launching an unprecedented socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Through this struggle, the rampant offensive of the bourgeois rightists was repelled, bourgeois ideology was criticized, and the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses was raised, enhancing their ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. This greatly boosted the morale of the 650 million people, resulting in a continuous great leap forward situation since 1958. This is a typical example of correctly handling contradictions among the people and giving full play to the subjective initiative of the broad masses of people.

    The emergence and development of the people's commune vividly illustrates that under the socialist system, people can consciously and proactively resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the economic base and the superstructure, which arise from the rapid development of the productive forces.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: The contradictions in socialist society are fundamentally different from the contradictions in the old society. Although the basic contradictions in socialist society are still the contradictions between the relations of production, the productive forces and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base, they are fundamentally different in nature and situation from these contradictions in the old society. The contradictions in capitalist society cannot be resolved by the capitalist system itself, and can only be resolved by the socialist revolution; however, the contradictions in socialist society can be continuously resolved through the socialist system itself. In the capitalist era, the bourgeoisie used all its strength to maintain its relations of production and superstructure. To change them, it was necessary to engage in antagonistic class struggle with the bourgeoisie and go through a long period of revolutionary struggle. In socialist society, due to the proletarian dictatorship, both for the contradictions that arise between the relations of production and the productive forces, and for the contradictions that arise between the superstructure and the economic base, conscious and proactive measures can be taken to properly resolve these contradictions and turn non-adaptable situations into mutually adaptable ones. Under the socialist system, people can, through subjective efforts, constantly resolve the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the economic base and the superstructure, which arise from the rapid development of the productive forces, under possible conditions, so that socialist construction is constantly in a state of continuous leap forward. The emergence and development of people's communes in our country are such typical examples. In the winter of 1957, a mass movement to build water conservancy projects was launched across the country, which greatly developed production and construction in rural areas, such as the start of large-scale agricultural tool reforms, which required the development of industry in rural areas, etc. Thus, the original small-scale organizational form of advanced cooperatives that were solely engaged in agriculture showed that they were not adapted to the requirements of rapid and large-scale development of production. Comrade Mao Zedong considered this situation at the Chengdu Conference held in March 1958 and proposed to plan, appropriately and merge small agricultural production cooperatives into large cooperatives (Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the superiority of large cooperatives in 1955). This proposal was subsequently formally approved by the Party Central Committee. The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, held in May 1958, adopted the general line for socialist construction based on Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal, which further inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural cadres and people, thereby enabling agricultural production and basic construction, industry serving agriculture, transportation, rural commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, and militia affairs to achieve rapid development. At this time, the peasants demanded to organize labor more reasonably and collectively, and with the further collectivization of production, the collectivization of life was also required. At the same time, it was required to combine the grassroots political power organization and the economic organization to strengthen unified leadership. This new form of social organization had actually emerged in various places, but at the beginning, various names were used in various places. It was not until June that the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong chose the most suitable name of "People's Commune," and it was unanimously passed at the Beidaihe Conference of the Party in August. After the publication of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," the rural areas across the country achieved people's communalization in less than a few months, which greatly promoted the socialist revolution and socialist construction cause across the country. The people's commune is both a relationship of production and a superstructure. Its establishment and development vividly illustrates that there are contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base in socialist society. As long as the leadership discovers these contradictions in a timely manner and takes correct policies to actively resolve them, the role of promoting social development is immeasurable.

    The transformation process from advanced cooperative to people's commune can also illustrate the principle that the development of things has partial qualitative changes in quantitative changes. Although the people's commune and the advanced cooperative both belong to the category of socialist collective ownership, due to its "large size and high degree of public ownership," due to the further disappearance of the remnants of private ownership, due to the emergence of elements of ownership by the whole people, especially due to the development of collective welfare undertakings and the implementation of a distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system, it has begun to have the buds of the communist principle of distribution according to need. This shows that the transformation of advanced cooperatives into people's communes is not only a great development in quantity, but also has partial qualitative changes. The entire qualitative change of everything is completed through a series of continuous quantitative changes, through continuous partial qualitative changes in quantitative changes. Quantitative change and qualitative change are the unity of opposites. The process of socialist society completing its entire transition period is a process of continuous occurrence of contradictions and resolution of contradictions, and is a process of continuous quantitative change, completed through continuous partial qualitative changes in quantitative changes. For example, on the ideological transformation front of socialism, through continuous quantitative changes, as well as continuous partial qualitative changes in continuous quantitative changes, one day, the ideological influence of capitalism will be completely eliminated. At that time, the qualitative change of this ideological transformation will also be completed. Then, the process of quantitative change on a new qualitative basis will begin again. Because the nature of the contradictions and basic contradictions within socialist society are different from those of the old society, it can be resolved by socialist society itself. Therefore, socialist society is very conducive to giving play to people's subjective initiative. As long as people can gradually grasp the laws of internal contradictions in society, they can, as Engels predicted in "Anti-Dühring," "begin to fully consciously create their own history," and gradually "become the masters of their own social and economic relations." Then, society can develop more rapidly.

    Comrade Mao Zedong used the law of the unity of opposites to deal with the relationship between various economic sectors, the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and created the theory of active balance, which laid the theoretical foundation for fully giving play to people's subjective initiative.

    Comrade Mao Zedong also told us in this work that we should use the law of the unity of opposites to observe and handle the mutual relations between various departments of the national economy, and to handle various contradictions and imbalances that constantly arise in the development of the national economy. On April 25, 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "Ten Major Relationships" at an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, requiring the entire Party to correctly handle: (1) the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry; (2) the relationship between coastal industry and inland industry; (3) the relationship between economic construction and national defense construction; (4) the relationship between the state, cooperatives, and individuals; (5) the relationship between the central government and local governments; (6) the relationship between the Han nationality and minority nationalities; (7) the relationship between the Party and non-Party members; (8) the relationship between revolution and counter-revolution; (9) the relationship between right and wrong inside and outside the Party; (10) international relations. The problems of mutual relations in the above-mentioned aspects are also the problems of contradictions in various aspects. Heavy industry and light industry, industry and agriculture, coastal industry and inland industry, economic construction and national defense construction, the state and cooperatives, the collective and individuals, the central government and local governments, etc., all have contradictions. The world is composed of contradictions, and the world is contradictions. The purpose of correctly handling these contradictions is to mobilize all positive factors and to mobilize all available forces to serve socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong also specifically pointed out: "Our country makes an economic plan once a year, arranging the appropriate proportion of accumulation and consumption, and seeking a balance between production and needs. The so-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After a year, on the whole, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, this unity changes, the balance becomes imbalance, the unity becomes disunity, and a second year's balance and unity is needed. This is the superiority of our planned economy. In fact, this balance and unity is broken locally every month and every quarter, and local adjustments need to be made. Sometimes, because the subjective arrangements do not conform to the objective situation, contradictions arise and the balance is disrupted, which is called making mistakes. Contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved, which is the dialectical law of the development of things." Comrade Mao Zedong used the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people to guide economic construction, to handle the relationship between various economic sectors and the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and created the theory of active balance, which is the opposite of the theory of passive balance. This laid the theoretical foundation for fully giving play to people's subjective initiative in economic construction. By 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the above-mentioned principles into the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The several simultaneous developments and several mutual combinations included in the general line are the most specific policies and methods for correctly handling the contradictions between various economic departments. It can fully give play to the enthusiasm of the 650 million people, can fully give play to the active role of all localities and all economic departments, and can fully give play to the huge potential power of various technologies and materials.

    In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong also reminded us from the opposite side: In general, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic, but if they are not handled properly, or if we lose vigilance, become paralyzed and careless, antagonistic actions may occur. Because socialist countries have eliminated the system of man exploiting man, the interests of the people are fundamentally consistent. Even if antagonism occurs, it is usually only a local and temporary phenomenon, but it will inevitably suffer varying degrees of loss and should be avoided as much as possible.

    In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly explained that contradiction is the driving force of socialist society, repeatedly explained the importance of correctly handling contradictions among the people and the policies and methods that should be adopted, and took the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the guiding principle, running through all aspects like a red line, and specifically applied it to the problems of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, agricultural cooperation, industrialists and businessmen, intellectuals, minority nationalities, overall planning and appropriate arrangements, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, the problem of a few people making trouble, whether bad things can turn into good things, the road to economy and China's industrialization, and other eleven issues, which in essence has become the political program of the socialist period. The Marxist-Leninist truths revealed by Comrade Mao Zedong in this work have become an invincible and powerful material force once grasped by the whole Party and the broad masses of the people. In a short period of three years, a torrent of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has emerged, the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has emerged, the great leap forward that has lasted for three years and will continue to increase has emerged, and the social organization form of going to the road of communism—the people's commune—has emerged. Recently, a nationwide and comprehensive upsurge of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution has emerged. The situation described by Comrade Mao Zedong in "Introducing a Cooperative" that "The communist spirit is flourishing across the country. The political consciousness of the broad masses of the people has rapidly increased. The backward strata among the masses are striving to catch up with the advanced strata, and this fact marks that our country's socialist economic revolution (the part of the relations of production that has not yet completed the transformation), political revolution, ideological revolution, technological revolution, and cultural revolution are moving forward" is rising year by year. The goal that Comrade Mao Zedong said three years ago in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "At this time, we put forward the line of dividing the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the people, and put forward the problem of correctly handling the contradictions among the people, in order to unite the people of all ethnic groups across the country to carry out a new war - to fight against nature, develop our economy, develop our culture, so that all the people can smoothly pass through the current transition period, consolidate our new system, and build our new country" is rapidly being realized. Three years is not a long time, but this work has already played such a great role in promoting it domestically, and it has already had a profound impact internationally. It can be asserted that in the future, it will have an even greater role and influence, which is difficult for us to estimate, both domestically and internationally.

    矛盾是社会主义社会发展的动力
    ——纪念《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》发表三周年
   中共河南省委第一书记　吴芝圃
    阶级社会存在着阶级斗争，存在着敌对阶级的对抗性的矛盾，这种矛盾也就是推动社会向前发展的动力，这是相信马克思列宁主义的人，一般都能够了解的。但是当社会主义革命取得胜利以后，当反动统治阶级的政权被推翻、人剥削人的社会制度被消灭以后，社会内部是不是还存在着矛盾？人民内部是不是还存在着矛盾？生产关系同生产力之间、上层建筑同经济基础之间是不是还存在着矛盾？即使还存在着矛盾，这种矛盾是不是推动社会向前发展的动力？这些问题，就成为人们认识上很不一致的问题了。有些人不相信在人类社会中，除了敌我矛盾以外，还会有人民内部矛盾；甚至认为在所谓原子时代，敌我也可以化除界限，猫鼠同眠，没有什么矛盾了。有些人不相信在社会主义社会里生产关系同生产力之间、上层建筑同经济基础之间，除互相适应的一面以外，还有互相矛盾的一面；甚至认为社会主义社会内部，既没有不相适应的矛盾，也不需要再从解决矛盾、再从斗争中求得发展；即使还要向共产主义发展，也无须经过质的飞跃、经过革命性的转变了。至于推动社会主义社会发展的动力，有的人认为只要技术发展了，生产力发展了，生产率水平达到了一定的程度，就不需要进一步调整和改善社会制度的某些环节，不需要依靠广大群众进行经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的革命斗争，就可以进入共产主义社会。也就是说，不需要解决生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾、上层建筑同经济基础之间的矛盾，社会同样可以向前发展，矛盾已经不是推动社会的车轮继续前进的动力了。他们只承认社会主义社会团结一致，坚如磐石，认为这才是社会发展的动力。这些说法，显然是违反社会发展的客观规律的，是违反马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和辩证唯物主义的学说的。这些错误的说法会使社会主义社会的广大人民迷失方向，按照这些说法办事，就会使社会主义社会停滞不前。这就可以说明，在当前解决社会主义社会发展的动力是什么这一问题的重要性。
    毛泽东同志在三年前发表的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的著作，杰出地创造性地运用马克思列宁主义关于对立统一的学说，为生活在社会主义这一个巨大变革时代的人们，解决了什么是社会主义社会发展的动力的问题，也就是解决了在社会主义时期以至进入共产主义社会以后的一个带根本性的问题。毛泽东同志在这部伟大的著作中说：
    “马克思主义的哲学认为，对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。矛盾着的对立面又统一，又斗争，由此推动事物的运动和变化。矛盾是普遍存在的，不过按事物的性质不同，矛盾的性质也就不同。对于任何一个具体的事物说来，对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、过渡的，因而是相对的，对立的斗争则是绝对的。这个规律，列宁讲得很清楚。这个规律，在我国，懂得的人逐渐多起来了。但是，对于许多人说来，承认这个规律是一回事，应用这个规律去观察问题和处理问题又是一回事。许多人不敢公开承认我国人民内部还存在着矛盾，正是这些矛盾推动着我们的社会向前发展。许多人不承认社会主义社会还有矛盾，因而使得他们在社会矛盾面前缩手缩脚，处于被动地位；不懂得在不断地正确处理和解决矛盾的过程中，将会使社会主义社会内部的统一和团结日益巩固。这样，就有必要在我国人民中，首先是在干部中，进行解释，引导人们认识社会主义社会中的矛盾，并且懂得采取正确的方法处理这种矛盾。”
    这就是对于什么是社会主义社会发展的动力的概括的说明。
    社会主义建设时期，人民内部矛盾日益突出起来，这是不以人们的意志为转移的铁的事实；要及时地发现矛盾，采取正确的方法解决矛盾，使社会主义建设事业高速度地发展
    在这部著作里，毛泽东同志首先告诉我们要正视客观存在，正视人民内部矛盾的存在，决不要掩盖和回避这种矛盾。在目前，中国人民除了对外反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略，实质上是对于世界上大垄断资产阶级的阶级斗争，是敌我矛盾以外，在国内还存在着两类性质不同的矛盾，一类是敌我矛盾，对抗性的；另一类是人民内部矛盾，这类矛盾在劳动人民之间来说，是非对抗性的，在被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间来说，除了对抗性的一面以外，还有非对抗性的一面。这两类矛盾的存在，是由于我国现在还存在着两个剥削阶级和两个劳动阶级。两个剥削阶级：一个是反社会主义的资产阶级右派、被打倒了的地主买办阶级和其他反动派（包括西藏背叛祖国的奴隶主）；资产阶级右派实质上是帝国主义者、封建买办残余势力和蒋介石国民党的代理人，他们在群众中已经十分孤立，并且还正在分化。另一个是正在逐步地接受社会主义改造的民族资产阶级和它的知识分子，他们近几年来在思想改造方面有很大的进步，但他们的大多数人在社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间还没有完全摆脱动摇的过渡状态。两个劳动阶级：一个是农民和其他原先的个体劳动者，这些劳动者的绝大部分已经加入农村和城市的人民公社，愈来愈成为社会主义的热烈拥护者。一个是工人阶级，这是全国人民中的最先进的队伍，是我们国家政权和社会主义事业的领导力量。这两个剥削阶级和两个劳动阶级各有他们的不同的世界观，“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”这就是国内现在存在的两类矛盾的阶级基础和思想基础。1957年到1958年所展开的全民整风运动和反右派斗争，是我国在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命；1959年反对右倾机会主义的斗争，是这种斗争的继续。这些斗争生动地表明了两个剥削阶级和两个劳动阶级的不同的利害关系和不同的立场，同时也充分地证明了在社会主义建设时期中，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，始终是我国内部的主要矛盾（这种矛盾是毛泽东同志在这部著作中所说的基本矛盾的具体表现）。这种矛盾，在某些范围内表现为激烈的你死我活的敌我矛盾，资产阶级右派在1957年的进攻中所表现的就是如此。资产阶级右派的这次进攻虽然被击退了，但是以后一有机会，他们还会兴风作浪。因此，对于资产阶级右派必须准备作长时间的反复的斗争，才能彻底解决他们同人民之间的矛盾。我们现在和地、富、反、坏、右五类分子的斗争，在性质上都是属于敌我矛盾的范畴的。但是在我国目前的具体条件下，资产阶级同无产阶级之间、资本主义道路同社会主义道路之间的矛盾，在大多数的情况下表现为人民内部矛盾。这些矛盾，一部分是民族资产阶级、小资产阶级同无产阶级之间的矛盾，一部分是在无产阶级内部由于有一部分人受了资产阶级、小资产阶级的影响而产生的矛盾。至于劳动人民中间在认识上的正确与错误、先进与落后的矛盾，其中有些同资产阶级、小资产阶级的影响有关系，但多数不属于阶级间的矛盾。这种矛盾在社会主义社会的人民内部大量的普遍的存在着，甚至于到了共产主义社会，也还会继续存在。人民内部的矛盾并不是到社会主义社会才有，但我国进入社会主义建设时期以后，人民内部矛盾就日加显著地突出起来并日益上升到重要的地位。这是铁一般的事实，是不以人们的意志为转移的客观存在的事实。你承认它存在它也存在，不承认它存在它也存在，你想抹煞它是抹煞不了的，想掩盖它是掩盖不了的，想躲避它是躲避不了的。如果企图抹煞、掩盖和躲避人民内部矛盾，矛盾非但得不到解决，反而会变得更加尖锐，甚至会引起矛盾的转化，使人民内部的非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾，以致阻碍社会主义事业的顺利进展。如果把人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾混淆了，划不清两类矛盾的界线，就会发生“左”倾或右倾的路线性的错误和危险。毛泽东同志对这个问题所持的态度和上边所说的态度恰恰相反，他不但主张正视人民内部矛盾的存在，正确地划分人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的界线，而且主张积极地揭露矛盾，积极地采取正确的方针政策，主动地及时地处理这些矛盾，这样，就能变消极因素为积极因素，就能调动一切积极因素，团结全国人民，为进行伟大的社会主义建设事业而斗争。
    在这部著作里，毛泽东同志特别着重教导我们：在认识了社会主义社会人民内部矛盾的基础上，还要进一步掌握矛盾的规律，积极地利用这些规律去改造世界，努力进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。社会主义社会的特点，就对内来说，人民内部的矛盾已经上升到重要的地位。人民内部矛盾中间虽然包括着工人阶级和其他劳动人民同资产阶级之间的矛盾，包括着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，但除此以外，还存在于劳动人民内部和工人阶级内部。一般说来，人民内部矛盾是人民内部的是非问题，而且大量的是正确与错误、先进与落后的问题，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾，这是和敌我矛盾性质不同的非对抗性的矛盾，这种矛盾可以用非对抗的斗争形式（不是调和的）来解决。如果党和国家的领导上，能够及时注意发现矛盾，并能够主动地及时地采取正确的方针、方法去解决矛盾，那就可以消除各方面存在的阻力和不调和的现象，就可以调动一切积极因素，充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，使社会主义事业高速度的发展。对于解决人民内部矛盾，我们党是有丰富的经验的。在几十年的斗争中，我们党积累了一整套正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法。毛泽东同志把这种方法具体化为一个公式，叫做“团结——批评——团结”。讲详细一点，就是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。经验证明，这种方法是非常成功的。它可以最大限度地孤立敌人，最大限度地壮大自己。1942年我们党采用了这个方法去解决教条主义者和广大党员群众之间的矛盾，教条主义思想和马克思主义思想之间的矛盾，经过几年的功夫，到1945年中国共产党召开第七次全国代表大会的时候，果然达到了全党团结的目的，因此就取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。这种方法在党外的运用，是从1927年就开始了的。1927年我们党在南方开始建立军队和革命根据地，关于处理党群关系、军民关系、官兵关系，就是采用这个方法的。到了抗日时期，我们党就把这个方法建立在更加自觉的基础上。在各抗日根据地，处理领导和群众的关系，处理军民关系、官兵关系，几部分军队之间的关系，几部分干部之间的关系，都采用了这个方法，并且得到了伟大的成功。全国解放以后，我们党对民主党派和工商界也采取了“团结——批评——团结”这个方法，也得到了很大的成功。因此，毛泽东同志强调说：“我们现在的任务，就是要在整个人民内部继续推广和更好地运用这个方法，要求所有的工厂、合作社、商店、学校、机关、团体，总之，六亿人口，都采用这个方法去解决他们内部的矛盾。”毛泽东同志这个号召，马上得到了全国人民的热烈响应，展开了史无前例的政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。经过这场斗争，打退了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，批判了资产阶级思想，提高了广大群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，增强了他们分辨大是大非、识别香花毒草的能力，因而极大地鼓足了六亿五千万人民的干劲，出现了1958年以来连续大跃进的局面。这就是正确处理人民内部矛盾，充分发挥广大人民的主观能动性的典型的例子。
    人民公社的产生和发展，生动地说明：在社会主义制度下，人们可以自觉地主动地解决由于生产力的飞跃发展所出现的生产关系和生产力之间、经济基础和上层建筑之间的矛盾
    毛泽东同志指出：社会主义社会的矛盾同旧社会的矛盾根本不同，社会主义社会的基本矛盾虽然仍是生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑同经济基础之间的矛盾，但却同旧社会的这些矛盾具有根本不同的性质和情况。资本主义社会的矛盾，不可能由资本主义制度本身来解决，而只有社会主义革命才能加以解决；但社会主义社会的矛盾却可以经过社会主义制度本身，不断得到解决。在资本主义时代，资产阶级用尽一切力量来维护它的生产关系和上层建筑，要加以改变，就必须同资产阶级进行对抗的阶级斗争，必须经过长期的革命斗争。在社会主义社会，由于是无产阶级专政，无论对于生产关系同生产力之间所发生的矛盾，或者是上层建筑同经济基础之间所发生的矛盾，都可以采取自觉的主动的措施，把这些矛盾加以妥善地解决，变不相适应为互相适应。在社会主义制度下，人们可以由主观的努力，在可能的条件下，不断地解决由于生产力的飞跃发展所出现的生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾，经济基础同上层建筑之间的矛盾，而使社会主义建设经常处在持续跃进的状态。我国人民公社的产生和发展，便是这样的典型的例子。1957年冬天在全国范围内掀起了群众性的大兴水利运动，使农村中的生产建设有了极大的发展，如开始进行大量的农具改革，因而要求在农村也大办工业等等。这样，原来的小规模的单纯经营农业的高级社的组织形式显出了同迅速地大规模地发展生产的要求不相适应。毛泽东同志在1958年3月间召开的成都会议上考虑到这种情况，就提出了把小型的农业生产合作社有计划地适当地合并为大型的合作社的建议（毛泽东同志在1955年就指出了大社的优越性），这个建议随后得到了党中央的正式同意。1958年5月间举行的党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议根据毛泽东同志的建议，通过了社会主义建设的总路线，这就更大地鼓舞了广大农村干部和群众的积极性，从而使农业的生产和基本建设、为农业服务的工业、交通运输业、农村的商业、文化教育事业和民兵事业，都获得了迅速的发展。这时，农民越发要求把劳动力组织得更合理，更加集体化，而随着生产的更加集体化，也要求生活的集体化。同时，要求把基层政权组织和经济组织合而为一，以便加强统一领导。这种新的社会组织形式实际上已经在各地方产生，但在开始的时候各地方却采用过各种各样的名称。到6月间，党中央和毛泽东同志才选择了“人民公社”这个最合适的名称，而在8月间党的北戴河会议上被一致通过。在党中央《关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议》公布以后，不到几个月的功夫，全国农村就实现了人民公社化，这就大大推进了全国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。人民公社既是生产关系又是上层建筑，它的建立和发展生动地说明：社会主义社会的生产关系和生产力之间，上层建筑和经济基础之间，是存在着矛盾的，只要领导上及时发现这些矛盾，并采取正确的方针，主动地加以解决，对于社会发展的推动作用，是不可估量的。
    由高级合作社到人民公社的转变过程，还可以说明事物的发展在量变中有局部的质变这一原理。人民公社虽然和高级社同属于社会主义的集体所有制的范畴，但由于它的“一大二公”，由于私有制残余的进一步消失，由于全民所有制成分的出现，尤其是由于集体福利事业的发展及工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度的实行，它已开始带有共产主义的按需分配原则的萌芽。这就表明，高级社转变为人民公社，不但是量的大大地发展，而且已经带有部分的质的变化。一切事物的整个质变，都是通过一系列的不断的量变，通过量变中的不断的部分质变而完成的。量变和质变是对立的统一。社会主义社会完成它整个过渡时期任务的过程，就是一个不断发生矛盾和解决矛盾的过程，就是一个不断的量变，通过量变中不断的部分质变而完成的过程。例如在社会主义的思想改造的战线上，经过不断的量变，以及不断量变中的不断的部分的质变，总有一天，资本主义的思想影响会完全肃清。到那时，这种思想改造的质变也就完成了。然后又会开始在新的质的基础上的量变过程。由于社会主义社会内部矛盾和基本矛盾的性质和旧社会不同，它可以由社会主义社会本身来解决。因此，社会主义社会就十分便于发挥人的主观能动性，人们只要能够逐步掌握住社会内部矛盾的规律，便可以像恩格斯在“反杜林论”中所预言的，做到“开始完全自觉地自己创造自己的历史”，逐步做到“人们成为自己社会经济关系的主人”。那末，社会也就可以更迅速地向前发展了。
    毛泽东同志运用对立统一的规律处理各经济部门之间的关系，积累和消费之间的关系，创造出积极平衡论，这就为充分发挥人的主观能动性奠定了理论基础
    毛泽东同志在这部著作中还告诉我们，要运用对立统一的规律去观察和处理国民经济各部门之间的相互关系，处理国民经济发展中不断出现的各种矛盾和各种不平衡的问题。1956年4月25日毛泽东同志在党的中央政治局扩大会议上作了关于“十大关系”的报告，要求全党正确处理：（一）工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的关系；（二）沿海工业和内地工业的关系；（三）经济建设和国防建设的关系；（四）国家、合作社和个人的关系；（五）中央和地方的关系；（六）汉族和少数民族的关系；（七）党和非党的关系；（八）革命和反革命的关系；（九）党内党外的是非关系；（十）国际关系。上面讲的各方面的相互关系的问题，也就是讲各方面的矛盾问题。重工业和轻工业，工业和农业，沿海工业和内地工业，经济建设和国防建设，国家和合作社，集体和个人，中央和地方等，都有矛盾。世界是由矛盾组成的，世界即矛盾。正确处理这些矛盾的目的，就是要把一切积极因素都调动起来，要把一切可用的力量都调动起来，为社会主义服务。毛泽东同志又特别指出：“我国每年作一次经济计划，安排积累和消费的适当比例，求得生产和需要之间的平衡。所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一。这就是我们计划经济的优越性。事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整，有时因为主观安排不符合客观情况，发生矛盾，破坏平衡，这就叫做犯错误。矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律。”毛泽东同志运用正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则来指导经济建设，来处理各经济部门之间的关系以及积累和消费之间的关系，并且创造出和消极平衡论成为对立面的积极平衡论，这就为在经济建设上充分发挥人的主观能动性奠定了理论的基础。到1958年毛泽东同志又把上述的原则归纳为鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。总路线中所包括的几个并举，几种互相结合，就是正确处理各个经济部门之间的矛盾的最具体的方针和方法，它能够充分发挥六亿五千万人民的积极性，能够充分发挥各地方和各经济部门的积极作用，能够充分发挥各种技术和物力的巨大的潜在力量。
    毛泽东同志在这部著作里还从相反的方面来提醒我们：在一般情况下，人民内部的矛盾不是对抗性的，但是如果处理得不适当，或者失去警觉，麻痹大意，也可能发生对抗行动。由于社会主义国家消灭了人剥削人的制度，人民的利益在根本上是一致的，即使发生对抗，通常只是局部的暂时的现象，但也必然会遭受或轻或重的损失，应该竭力避免。
    毛泽东同志在这部著作里反复地说明了矛盾是社会主义社会的动力，反复地说明了正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要性和应该采取的方针、方法，并且以正确处理人民内部矛盾为纲，像一条红线一样贯串到各方面，具体地运用到肃反问题，农业合作化问题，工商业者问题，知识分子问题，少数民族问题，统筹兼顾、适当安排，关于百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督，关于少数人闹事问题，坏事能否变成好事，关于节约和中国工业化的道路等十一个问题上，在实质上已经成为社会主义时期的政治纲领。毛泽东同志在这部著作中所揭示的马克思列宁主义的真理，一为全党和广大人民群众所掌握，便成为不可战胜的强大的物质力量。在短短的三年间，出现了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的洪流，出现了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，出现了已经持续三年之久而且还要继长增高的大跃进，出现了走向共产主义道路的社会组织形式——人民公社，最近又出现了全民性全面性的技术革命和文化革命的高潮。毛泽东同志在《介绍一个合作社》中所说的“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展。广大群众的政治觉悟迅速提高。群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层，这个事实标志着我国社会主义的经济革命（生产关系方面尚未完成改造的部分）、政治革命、思想革命、技术革命、文化革命正在向前奋进”的局面，正在一年比一年的高涨。毛泽东同志三年前在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部著作中所说的“在这个时候，我们提出划分敌我和人民内部两类矛盾的界线，提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，以便团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战，发展我们的经济，发展我们的文化，使全体人民比较顺利地走过目前的过渡时期，巩固我们的新制度，建设我们的新国家”的目标，正在迅速地实现。三年的时间并不算长，但这部著作已经在国内起了这么伟大的促进作用，在国际上也已经有了深刻的影响。今后在国内和国外将要发生我们难以估量的更伟大的作用和影响，是可以断言的。
