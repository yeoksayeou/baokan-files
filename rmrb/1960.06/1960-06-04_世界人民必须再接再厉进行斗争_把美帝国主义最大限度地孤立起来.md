Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China held a grand state banquet tonight to warmly welcome Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania.

At 7:30 PM, Chairman Haxhi Lleshi, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai, entered the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. At this moment, the 500 Chinese and foreign guests attending the state banquet all stood up and applauded warmly for a long time to welcome them.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke first, expressing a warm welcome and high respect to the envoys of the fraternal Albanian people. Chairman Liu strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for infringing upon the Soviet Union, sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, and all its evil activities in the world, pointing out that all this has most profoundly educated the people of the world from the negative side, further arousing the world's people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Liu said: "Although U.S. imperialism's tactics have undergone this or that change in different periods, its arms expansion policy and the two-pronged approach of peaceful deception are used either simultaneously or alternately, the nature of U.S. imperialism and its ambition to dominate the globe and enslave the people of the world will not change." He said: "We must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism, such a most ferocious enemy, but must wage a tit-for-tat struggle against it. When it engages in war threats and launches wars of aggression, we must dare to counterattack and not be intimidated by it; when it engages in peace conspiracies, we must be good at seeing through and exposing its hypocritical tricks and not fall into its traps. Only in this way can we effectively curb the aggressive arrogance of U.S. imperialism." He said: "We firmly believe that with the improvement of the awareness of the people all over the world and the expansion of the anti-imperialist united front, the aggression and war preparations activities of imperialism headed by the United States will be defeated one after another. No matter what new conspiracies U.S. imperialism may play, their inevitable fate of failure cannot be reversed."

Chairman Liu said: The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is always a strong fortress for defending world peace. "Our socialist countries will never, cannot, and should not infringe upon any country, but if imperialism regards the sincerity of socialist countries in seeking peace as a sign of weakness and dares to provoke any socialist country, it will surely be met with a resolute counterattack from all socialist countries." "The Chinese people will always stand together with the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, to wage an unyielding struggle against the war policies and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States, and for the defense of world peace."

Chairman Liu said: "Although U.S. imperialism and its ringleader Eisenhower single-handedly ruined the Four-Power Summit Conference that the world was concerned about, and seriously threatened world peace, we have always believed that all international disputes should be resolved through negotiations, rather than resorting to force. However, we believe that any international negotiations must be conducted on the basis of equality, and must take non-aggression against each other's sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs as the minimum conditions. Experience has proved that imperialism, first and foremost U.S. imperialism, has no sincerity for peace and is the least trustworthy in international affairs." He said: "In order to realize the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and in order to realize the desire of peace-loving countries and people in the world to ease international tensions, the people of all countries in the world must continue to fight against U.S. imperialism, constantly strike at its conspiracies to undermine peace, and isolate it to the greatest extent possible. Only in this way can it be possible to force U.S. imperialism to sit down and negotiate with us, to postpone or even stop the plans of U.S. imperialism to launch a new war, and to make world peace reliably guaranteed."

Speaking of Sino-Albanian friendship, Chairman Liu said: "China and Albania are two fraternal countries closely united. Our unity is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is forever inseparable. For more than ten years, our two countries have always cooperated closely and supported each other in the common struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and for building socialism."

Chairman Liu said: The People's Republic of Albania is a staunch member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The heroic Albanian people have always stood firmly on the southwest outpost of our camp, never taking U.S. imperialism and its running dogs seriously, and have waged a tenacious and unremitting struggle against them. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian People, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, have constantly struck at the provocations and subversion activities of the Yugoslav modern revisionists, thoroughly exposing the ugly face of the Tito clique as agents of imperialism. All this has made outstanding contributions to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and encouraging the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people all over the world. The Chinese people, the people of other socialist countries, and all progressive mankind will always stand on the side of the Albanian people.

Chairman Haxhi Lleshi then spoke. He emphasized: "The close friendship between socialist countries and the unity of the strong socialist camp are as strong as steel, and no force can destroy them. Just as U.S. imperialism suffered a shameful defeat for infringing on Soviet airspace for espionage activities, all imperialist conspiracies to undermine peace are doomed to failure. The US government's destruction of the summit conference is new evidence of its aggressive policy and 'position of strength' policy."

Chairman Lleshi said: "The characteristic of the new situation is that imperialism is doing its utmost to intensify the international situation. In this situation, the Albanian people will continue to support the Soviet Union's just peace policy, will heighten their vigilance, and will spare no effort to make their own contributions to the cause of defending peace. The Albanian people will continue to support the People's Republic of China in liberating its sacred territory—Taiwan and restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations organization."

Chairman Lleshi said: The Albanian people cherish and protect their friendship with the fraternal Chinese people, and this friendship, strengthened by the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries, is an important factor for peace. We are proud that our two countries are members of the strong, invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and we are infinitely happy that the influence of the socialist camp in the world is expanding day by day, which is conducive to all progressive mankind and the guarantee of peace.

Chairman Lleshi said: "Under the leadership of our two countries' Marxist-Leninist parties, inspired by the common ideals and the sacred goal of defending peace, our two peoples will fight to further consolidate the iron-like unity of our two countries, and will be ready at any time to strike at the imperialists and their running dogs, the modern revisionists, who attempt to weaken our united socialist camp and seize the victories we have already achieved."

Chairman Lleshi finally congratulated the fraternal Chinese people on their new victories on the brilliant road of socialism.

After the speeches by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Lleshi, the band played the national anthems of Albania and China respectively. During their speeches, the audience burst into thunderous applause from time to time.

Premier Zhou Enlai also raised his glass at the state banquet. He said: "We warmly welcome Chairman Haxhi Lleshi and other distinguished Albanian guests who have come from afar to visit our country. Thank you for bringing us the deep friendship of the fraternal Albanian people towards the Chinese people. I propose: To the brilliant achievements made by the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, to the victory of the Albanian government's peaceful foreign policy, to the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to world peace and the friendship of the people of all countries, cheers!"

Liri Belishova, Member of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Secretary of the Secretariat; Lefter Goga, Vice Chairman of the People's Assembly; and Vasil Nathanaili, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other distinguished guests attended the state banquet.

Also attending the state banquet tonight were: Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and Geng Biao, Chinese Ambassador to Albania Luo Shigao, President of the China-Albania Friendship Association Jiang Nanxiang, and heads of government departments, people's organizations, democratic parties, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, responsible persons of Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Albanian Ambassador to China Piro Koci, as well as diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries to China, were invited to attend the state banquet.

The grand state banquet proceeded in a cordial and warm atmosphere throughout. (Attached picture)

    刘少奇主席在欢迎列希主席的盛大国宴上讲话
    世界人民必须再接再厉进行斗争
    把美帝国主义最大限度地孤立起来
    列希主席说：强大的社会主义阵营的团结坚强如钢，没有力量能破坏它们
    新华社3日讯　中华人民共和国主席刘少奇今晚举行盛大国宴，热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希。
    七时半，哈奇·列希主席由刘少奇主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理等陪同，步入人民大会堂宴会厅。这时，出席国宴的五百名中外来宾，全体起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    刘少奇主席首先讲话，对兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。刘主席强烈谴责美帝国主义侵犯苏联、破坏四国政府首脑会议以及它在全世界所进行的一切罪恶活动，指出这一切都最深刻地从反面教育了世界人民，更加激起了世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争怒潮。
    刘主席说：“尽管美帝国主义的策略在不同时期有这样或者那样的变化，它的备战政策同和平欺骗的两手或者同时并用或者交替运用，但是美帝国主义的本质和它企图独霸全球、奴役世界人民的野心是不会改变的。”他说：“对于美帝国主义这样一个最凶恶的敌人，决不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而必须同它进行针锋相对的斗争。当它进行战争威慑和发动侵略战争的时候，我们一定要敢于进行反击，不要被它吓倒；当它玩弄和平阴谋的时候，我们一定要善于识破和揭穿它的虚伪手法，不要上它的圈套。只有这样，才能有效地抑制美帝国主义的侵略气焰。”他说：“我们坚信，随着全世界人民觉悟的提高和反帝统一战线的扩大，以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和备战活动将会一个接着一个地被击败。不管美帝国主义还会玩弄什么新的阴谋，它们必然失败的命运是无法挽回的。”
    刘主席说：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营始终是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。“我们社会主义国家绝对不会、也不可能、也不应该侵犯任何一个国家，但是帝国主义如果把社会主义国家谋求和平的诚意看成是示弱，而敢于向任何一个社会主义国家进行挑衅，那么它就一定要受到社会主义国家全体一致的坚决回击。”“中国人民将永远同苏联和其他社会主义国家人民一起，同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，为维护世界和平进行不屈不挠的斗争。”
    刘主席说：“尽管美帝国主义和它的头子艾森豪威尔一手断送了举世关心的四国政府首脑会议，严重地威胁着世界和平，我们始终认为一切国际争端，应该通过谈判的方式求得解决，而不诉诸武力。但是，我们认为任何国际谈判都必须在平等的基础之上进行，都必须以互不侵犯对方的主权和互不干涉对方的内政为起码条件。经验证明，帝国主义首先是美帝国主义是毫无和平诚意的，也是最不讲国际信义的。”他说：“为了实现苏联和其他社会主义国家的和平倡议，为了实现世界上爱好和平的国家和人民要求和缓国际紧张局势的愿望，世界各国人民必须再接再厉地同美帝国主义进行斗争，不断地打击它破坏和平的阴谋活动，最大限度地把它孤立起来。只有这样，才有可能迫使美帝国主义坐下来同我们谈判，才有可能推迟以至制止美帝国主义发动新战争的计划，才有可能使世界和平得到可靠的保障。”
    谈到中阿友谊的时候，刘主席说：“中国和阿尔巴尼亚是两个亲密团结的兄弟国家，我们的团结是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础之上的，是永远不可分离的。十多年来，我们两国在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和建设社会主义的共同斗争中，始终紧密合作，相互支持。”
    刘主席说：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强一员。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民始终屹立在我们阵营的西南前哨，从来不把美帝国主义及其走狗放在眼里，并且同它们进行了顽强不屈的斗争。特别值得提出的是，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，不断地打击了南斯拉夫现代修正主义者的挑衅和颠复活动，彻底揭露了铁托集团作为帝国主义代理人的丑恶面目。这一切对于捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，对于鼓舞全世界劳动人民的革命积极性作出了卓越的贡献。中国人民、其他社会主义国家人民和全世界进步人类都永远站在阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。
    哈奇·列希主席接着讲话。他强调说：“社会主义国家之间的亲密友谊和强大的社会主义阵营的团结，坚强如钢，没有力量能破坏它们。正如美帝国主义为了进行间谍活动而侵犯苏联领空遭到了可耻的失败一样，帝国主义的一切破坏和平的阴谋都是要失败的。美国政府破坏最高级会议是它的侵略政策和‘实力地位’政策的新证据。”
    列希主席说：“新的形势的特点是帝国主义极力使国际局势紧张化，在这种形势下，阿尔巴尼亚人民将继续支持苏联的正义的和平政策，将提高警惕性，并且在保卫和平的事业中，不遗余力地作出自己的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚人民将继续支持中华人民共和国解放自己的神圣领土——台湾和恢复它在联合国组织中合法的席位。”
    列希主席说：阿尔巴尼亚人民极为珍惜和保护它同兄弟的中国人民的友谊，为我们两国的马克思列宁主义政党所加强了的这一友谊是和平的一个重要因素。我们为我们两国都是以苏联为首的强大的、不可战胜的社会主义阵营的成员而感到自豪，为社会主义阵营在世界上的影响日益扩大而感到无限高兴，这是有利于全体进步人类和保障和平的。
    列希主席说：“我们两国人民在自己的马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，在共同的理想和保卫和平的神圣目标的鼓舞下，将为更加巩固我们两国的钢铁般的团结而斗争，将随时准备着打击企图削弱我们团结一致的社会主义阵营和夺取我们已经取得的胜利的帝国主义分子及其走狗现代修正主义分子。”
    列希主席最后祝贺兄弟的中国人民在社会主义的光辉道路上取得新的胜利。
    在刘少奇主席和列希主席讲话以后，乐队分别奏起阿尔巴尼亚和中国的国歌。在他们讲话的过程中，全场不时响起暴风雨般的掌声。
    周恩来总理也在国宴上举杯致词。他说：“我们热烈地欢迎远道前来我国访问的哈奇·列希主席和其他阿尔巴尼亚贵宾同志们。感谢你们为我们带来了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。我提议：为阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府领导下所取得的辉煌成就，为阿尔巴尼亚政府和平外交政策的胜利，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为世界和平和各国人民的友谊，干杯！”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团委员、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记利丽·贝利绍娃，人民议会副主席列夫特·戈加，外交部副部长瓦西里·纳塔奈利等全体贵宾，出席了国宴。
    今晚，出席国宴的还有：国务院副总理陈毅、李先念、陆定一、罗瑞卿、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、彭真、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞、耿飚，我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使罗士高，中国阿尔巴尼亚友好协会会长蒋南翔，和政府各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派负责人，解放军高级将领，北京市负责人以及首都各界人士等。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻我国大使帕里夫蒂以及各国驻我国的使节和外交官员，都应邀出席国宴。
    盛大的国宴一直都在亲切和热烈的气氛中进行。（附图片）
