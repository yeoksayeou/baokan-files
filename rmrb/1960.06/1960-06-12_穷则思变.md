    Poverty Spurs Change
    Zhou Baolin, Fitter at Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard

    Chairman Mao said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to action, to revolution." This is our ambition and our style. With this ambition and style, in the past, under the leadership of the Party, we overthrew the three great enemies and established the People's Republic of China. In the period of socialist construction, we relied on this ambition and style to move mountains and seas, constantly achieving greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward. In the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, this ambition and style are particularly evident. In our factory, there is an internal fitter team, which in the past mostly relied on manual operation and was very "poor." Now they propose to "retire" fitter benches and "reassign" vise pliers. One day, an experienced master worker said to a pair of vise pliers: "I want to make these vise pliers grow teeth." He did what he said. He and other comrades fought together for a day and a night, and the vise pliers grew teeth and became a homemade milling machine. The next day, everyone was surprised. Two comrades wrote a poem: "Fitter masters make innovations, use their brains on vise pliers, want to make the vise pliers grow teeth, and turn a yellow dog into a unicorn." Now they have changed the team's work into a流水作业线 assembly line, fully realizing mechanization, and this vise pliers has become the "dragon head" of a "dragon."

    Poverty spurs change. Change what? It is to change the "poor and blank" face of our country. Old China was the poorest. Due to the poor foundation, although there has been unprecedented progress after liberation, the "poor and blank" face has not yet been fundamentally changed. Therefore, we must change, and change as soon as possible. During the Great Leap Forward, plans were higher every month and every ten days, aiming to change the "poor and blank" face of our country at a high speed. However, to change the face, relying solely on the old soldiers and old guns will not achieve this goal. Therefore, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and achieve various forms of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The so-called "化 -ization" means change. In order to "ize," comrades in various trades have proposed various forms of "化 -ization" in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Sacrifice equipment master workers propose optical layout, automated welding, multi-head gas cutting, and模子化 model forming for cold and hot work; lathe masters propose component standardization, high-speed cutting, and machine tool automation; fitter masters propose multi-head drilling machines and mechanization of grinding, sawing, filing, and scraping; even crane operators, although they do not know much about technical innovation, also want to vigorously promote轨道化railways and automated cranes. Only with these "化 -izations" can we thoroughly change the "poor and blank" face of our country and better achieve the goals of monthly and ten-day increases and continuous great leaps forward.

    To change, we must "ize." Change heavy physical labor and manual operation to mechanization and semi-mechanization, and change mechanical operation to automation and semi-automation. But who will "ize" it? First of all, it is our workers. People are alive, and people are the most important and decisive element in social productivity. Lenin once said: "The primary productive force of mankind is the workers, the laborers." Tools are dead, and production tools themselves are created by people. To "ize" is for living people to change dead tools, making them better, more perfect, more obedient, and more in line with human requirements. But to realize various "化 -izations" more quickly, people must also exert their conscious initiative. To be able to exert conscious initiative, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of our Qiuxin Shipyard, like those all over the country, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide practice by studying Chairman Mao's "Introducing a Cooperative," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," the idea of walking on two legs, and "How Marxists Should View New Things." In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we overcame the ideas of greed for the big and foreign, overcame the ideas of唯条件论 conditionism and fear of difficulties, and established the idea of continuous revolution and a positive and enthusiastic attitude towards new things. Once Mao Zedong Thought is mastered by our workers, the technical revolution movement will develop rapidly. In just three short months, great achievements have been made. In March of this year, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations quickly increased from 46% at the end of 1959 to 97.1%. The backward tools such as carrying poles and sledgehammers of hundreds of years have been sent to the "museum." In the past, foundry workers always worked squatting. After working for a day, their backs ached. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, foundry masters thought of changing due to poverty, wanting to change these backward tools. After several days of hard work, they are now working in very comfortable swivel chairs. The back pain of the past has completely changed. Under the guidance of the idea of "poverty spurs change," the whole factory is full of energy, and various "化 -izations" have appeared in every corner, greatly improving production efficiency. February of this year exceeded January, and March completed the task three days ahead of schedule. In the first quarter of this year, labor productivity increased by 147.1% compared with the same period last year.

    Chairman Mao's idea of "poverty spurs change" reflects the urgent desire and strong demand of the 600 million people of our country to change our "poor and blank" face. "Change" means continuous change, which is continuous revolution. We still have heavy physical labor and manual operation, and we must advance towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, and towards automation and semi-automation. Similarly, when we realize automation and semi-automation, we must also advance towards radioization, atomization, and even higher goals. Even in communist society, we must still change, act, and make revolution.

    Change is development, and development is the overcoming of old contradictions and the emergence of new contradictions. Contradictions are eternal, and without contradictions, there would be nothing. Since contradictions are eternal, the development of things is also infinite. If one thinks that one has reached the end after achieving certain results and does not want to change, then one will become stagnant and fall behind. We must regard things as constantly changing and developing, recognize that development is limited at a certain stage, while the overall process is infinite, thereby establishing the idea of continuous revolution. In this way, our enthusiasm for action and revolution will always be sufficient, and we can better achieve sustained leaps forward.

    穷则思变
    上海求新造船厂钳工　周宝林
    毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命”。这是我们的志气，也是我们的风格。有了这种志气和风格，在过去，我们在党的领导下，推翻了三大敌人，建立了中华人民共和国。在社会主义建设时期，我们又凭这种志气和风格，移山倒海，不断实现更大更好更全面的跃进。在当前轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，特别明显地表现了这种志气和风格。我们厂有一个内钳小组，过去大部分是手工操作，穷得很，现在他们提出要叫钳桌台转业、老虎钳改行。有一天，有一个老师傅对着一个老虎钳说：“我要叫这老虎钳长出牙齿来。”说干就干，他和别的同志一起奋战了一天一夜，老虎钳就长出了牙齿，变成了一台土铣床。第二天，大家看了很奇怪。有两个同志写了一首诗：“钳床师傅闹革新，老虎钳上动脑筋，要叫老虎长牙齿，黄狗出角变麒麟。”现在他们又把小组的工作改为一条流水作业线，全部实现机械化，这只老虎钳也成了一条龙的龙头了。
    穷则思变。变什么？就是改变我们国家的“一穷二白”的面貌。旧中国是最穷的，由于基础太差，解放后虽然有空前的进步，“一穷二白”面貌到现在仍未根本改变。因此，一定要变，要尽快地变。在大跃进当中，计划月月高，旬旬高，就是要高速度地改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。但要改变面貌，单靠老兵老枪这一套东西，就不能达到这个目的。因此，就要大搞技术革新和技术革命，要实现各式各样机械化半机械化，自动化半自动化。所谓“化”就是变化。为了要化，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，各个工种的同志都提出了各式各样的“化”。牺装老师傅提出放样光学化，电焊自动化，气割多头化，冷工火工模子化；车床师傅提出什么零件标准化，切削高速化，机床自动化；钳工师傅提出钻床多头化，研磨、锯、锉、刮机械化；起重工虽然技术革新不太懂，也要大搞轨道化，行车自动化等。只有有了这些“化”，才能彻底改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，才能更好达到月月高，旬旬高，不断大跃进的目的。
    要变就要化。变重体力劳动、手工操作为机械化半机械化，变机械操作为自动化半自动化。但谁来叫它“化”？首先是我们工人。人是活的，人是社会生产力中最重要的、决定性的要素。列宁曾经说过：“人类的首要生产力就是工人，劳动者。”工具是死的，生产工具本身就是人制造出来的。要“化”，就是活的人去改变死的工具，叫它更好更完善，更听人使唤，更符合人的要求。但要更快地去实现各种“化”，还必须人来发挥自觉能动性。要能发挥自觉能动性，就要用毛泽东思想武装头脑。
    我们求新造船厂的工人，在党的领导下，和全国各地一样，通过对毛主席的“介绍一个合作社”、“星星之火，可以燎原”和关于两条腿走路的思想以及“马克思主义者应当如何看待新生事物”等著作的学习，用毛泽东思想来指导实际。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，克服了贪大求洋思想，克服了唯条件论、怕困难的思想，树立了不断革命思想和对待新生事物的积极热忱的态度。毛泽东思想一被我们工人掌握，技术革命运动就迅猛地开展起来。仅仅在短短的三个月时间内，取得了巨大的成绩。在今年3月，手工操作机械化半机械化程度由1959年底的46％很快地提高到97．1％。几百年来的扛棒、大鎯头等这些落后工具，都送进“博物馆”去了。翻砂工人过去一向都是蹲着工作的，工作了一天，弄得腰酸背痛。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，翻砂师傅穷则思变，要变掉这些落后的工具。他们经过几天的奋战，现在，都坐在很舒服的转椅上工作了。过去那种腰酸背痛的情况完全改变了。全厂由于“穷则思变”的思想指导，干劲十足，各个角落都出现了各种“化”，生产效率大大提高，今年2月超过了1月，3月又提前三天完成任务，今年第一季度劳动生产率比去年同期增长147．1％。
    毛主席的“穷则思变”的思想，反映了我国六亿人民改变我们“一穷二白”的面貌的迫切愿望和强烈要求。“变”是指不断的变，就是不断革命。我们现在还有重体力劳动和手工操作，要向机械化半机械化进军，要向自动化半自动化进军。同样的，我们实现了自动化半自动化，还要向无线电化、原子化，甚至更高的目标前进。一直到了共产主义社会，我们仍要变，要干，要革命。
    变化就是发展，发展就是旧的矛盾的克服和新的矛盾的产生。矛盾是永远存在着的，没有矛盾就没有一切。矛盾既然永远存在，因此事物的发展也是无限的。如果以为取得一定成绩就到头了，就不想变，那就成了停滞不前了，结果就要落后。我们一定要把事物看作是不断变化发展的，认识到发展在一定阶段上是有限的、而总的过程是无限的，从而树立起不断革命的思想来。这样，我们要干、要革命的劲头就能始终充足，也才能更好地实现持续跃进。
