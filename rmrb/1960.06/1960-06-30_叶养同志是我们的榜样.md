    Comrade Ye Yang is Our Role Model
    To the Editor:
    We have studied the report published in the People's Daily on June 15th about Comrade Ye Yang's excellent work style of eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses. We held a discussion, and everyone agreed that Comrade Ye Yang's "three together" excellent work style is our role model. His thrifty and simple lifestyle, his sharing weal and woe with the masses, his concern for the lives of the masses, and his active efforts to run the canteen well are all things we should learn from in the future.
    I feel that only with Comrade Ye Yang's excellent work style can we solve and overcome all the difficulties and problems existing in the production team. This will enable us to achieve greater agricultural harvests, accelerate socialist construction, and realize communism as soon as possible.
    Inspired by Comrade Ye Yang's deeds, we have made personal plans and guarantees:
    We will resolutely leave the office and make sure to arrange the production and life of the Xinji Commune's Du Daying production team that we are responsible for. Furthermore, we must go deep into the front lines of production and participate in labor even for a few hours during breaks in our work, and consistently learn from the masses humbly during labor. At the same time, in addition to unified planning, individuals should also have plans for each ten-day period, day, and hour, not wasting a single second.

    叶养同志是我们的榜样编辑同志：
    我们学习了6月15日人民日报刊登的关于叶养同志和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的优良作风的报道。我们进行了讨论，大家认为叶养同志三同的优良作风是我们的榜样。他的勤俭节约生活朴素的品质、他和群众同甘共苦、关心群众的生活、积极办好食堂，这些都是我们今后应当学习的。
    我感到，只有像叶养同志的这种优良作风才能解决和克服生产队中存在的一切困难和问题。使农业上获得更大的丰收，使社会主义建设的更快，使共产主义尽早实现。
    在叶养事迹的鼓舞下，我们已作出了个人计划和保证条件：
    坚决走出办公室，一定将所包生产队辛集公社都大营的生产和生活安排好。并且要深入到生产第一线，在工作空隙中那怕是几个钟头的时间也去参加劳动，并且坚持经常在劳动中虚心向群众学习。同时，除统一计划外，个人还要有旬、日、时的计划，不浪费一秒钟。
