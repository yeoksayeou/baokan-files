Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement this morning, strongly protesting the fascist crimes of the Kishin Nobusuke government in persecuting patriotic demonstrating students and creating a bloody tragedy.

    The statement first pointed out that this bloody atrocity was carried out according to a pre-planned scheme. The statement said that the police force's "suppression operation was extremely cruel and barbaric. As a result of the police's attacks, some students were killed and many were seriously injured. In addition, the police placed the seriously injured students and the bodies of the dead in the reception room of the Diet Building, preventing Diet members and reporters from entering the room. They attempted in this way to prevent the people from knowing the truth."

    The statement pointed out: "This is one of a series of suppression actions taken by the Kishin Nobusuke government against the people's movement against the Security Treaty. The police illegally and unreasonably attacked the union offices of the workers of Nippon Kokan company, the student self-government offices of Hosei University and Tokyo University of Education, arrested students, and condoned the thugs who attacked demonstrators on the 15th, thereby fueling their arrogance. The attack on students on the 15th should be regarded as one of this series of meticulously planned fascist actions."

    The statement said: "We condemn the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, believing that it should be held responsible for the murder. Nothing can justify this barbaric murder and suppression. Prime Minister Kishin Nobusuke should be condemned for bearing the greatest responsibility for this incident, because he has consistently refused to take responsibility for his own crimes."

    The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement this morning regarding the Kishin Nobusuke government's instigation of fascist thugs to brutally injure patriotic demonstrators and create a bloody tragedy, strongly demanding that the murderers be severely punished and that the traitorous Prime Minister Kishin Nobusuke immediately step down.

    The statement said: "On June 15, the 18th National Unified Action against the Security Treaty was conducted in an orderly manner under the leadership of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty. During this movement, at approximately five o'clock (in the afternoon), a group of thugs bearing flags marked with the Restoration Action Squad suddenly drove their trucks into the ranks of the demonstrators, mostly composed of cultural workers from the Security Treaty Criticism Association. At that time, the demonstrators were demonstrating peacefully outside the Diet Building. Dozens of other thugs wielding large wooden sticks with nails rushed into the crowd of demonstrators. They beat unarmed cultural workers, including actors and actresses. Some were seriously injured, with the number of injured reaching four."

    The statement pointed out: "Obviously, these fascist thugs were vicious agents instigated by the Kishin Nobusuke group to pave the way for Eisenhower's visit to Japan. During the thugs' violence, the police force on duty near the scene of the violence sat idly by without taking any action to stop the thugs from using violence. We cannot help but think that the police were secretly helping these thugs."

    The statement said that regarding this June 15th incident, the Japanese Communist Party demands the following:

    1. The criminals and their leaders should be severely punished.
    2. The responsibility for this incident lies with Kishin Nobusuke, and Kishin Nobusuke should resign immediately.
    3. The government should take immediate measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The relevant authorities should also bear full responsibility for this incident.

    The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the morning of the 16th strongly protesting the bloody suppression by the Kishin Nobusuke government and demanding that Kishin Nobusuke step down.

    The statement said that the demand for the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet to step down has become the voice of the entire nation, but the police colluded with violent groups to attack students and workers who gathered to make this demand, not only causing the death of a female student, but also injuring many people, and even injuring university professors and passers-by.

    The statement said: The worst situation we feared has finally arrived, and now there is no other way to clean up the mess except for the resignation of the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet.

    The statement said: "If Prime Minister Kishin has even a little bit of human conscience, he should resign immediately. We strongly demand the resignation of the Kishin cabinet in the name of the people."

    The Socialist Party also held a meeting of the Illegal Suppression Countermeasures Committee last night, deciding to thoroughly investigate the Kishin Nobusuke government's responsibility for this tragedy and to file charges.

    The Socialist Party also decided to launch a protest movement.

    The spokesman of the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement at a press conference at 11 p.m. on the 15th, severely condemning the fascist atrocities of the Kishin Nobusuke government in massacring demonstrating students, and called on all Japanese people to immediately take stronger actions to engage in the patriotic struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, against Eisenhower's "visit to Japan," demanding the resignation of the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

    The statement said: "This is outright murder. This is an unprecedented act of violence that denies the basis of human rights. This is a true manifestation of fascism. We express our deep condolences to the martyrs of our great cause. We express our most vehement indignation towards the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet. The responsibility for this tragedy should be borne entirely by the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet." The statement pointed out that the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet is an out-and-out fascist government.

    The statement detailed the process of Kishin Nobusuke instigating fascist thugs to harm demonstrators. The statement said: The police of the Kishin Nobusuke government "attacked students in the most barbaric way, killing at least two students and injuring hundreds of students, many of whom were seriously injured."

    The statement stated: "From the early morning of the 16th, we will launch even stronger protest actions against the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet and the Metropolitan Police Department, awakening all Japanese people to take action, demanding the immediate collective resignation of the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet."

    The statement pointed out that if Eisenhower dares to disregard the indignation of the Japanese people and come to Japan to encourage the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet, "we will respond to him with the strongest protest actions. We declare that we will fight for the cause for which the dead students struggled."

    The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" has decided late on the night of the 15th to hold a large-scale protest rally in front of the Diet from 11 a.m. on the 16th to protest the Kishin Nobusuke government's atrocities of killing students.

    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the most powerful trade union in Japan, issued a statement late on the night of the 15th, saying: "We strongly protest the barbaric actions taken by Kishin Nobusuke today against demonstrators opposing the Security Treaty. We demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet and the cancellation of the invitation to Eisenhower to visit Japan. At the same time, we demand that the police who killed the students be severely punished."

    The "General Council of Trade Unions of Japan" also announced that it will launch a large-scale protest movement.

    The statement was announced by Iwai Akira, the secretary-general of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, at a press conference.

    The statement said: "Actions against the Security Treaty were carried out in an orderly manner throughout Japan today, with a total of more than 5.8 million people participating in this action. However, thugs barbarically attacked petitioners who were demonstrating in Tokyo as part of a nationwide action, injuring dozens of actors, workers, and students. When the thugs attacked the demonstrators, the police remained strangely silent.

    Then, the police barbarically attacked students who were protesting the thugs' brutal attacks. It is said that several students were killed and hundreds of students were injured, some of whom were seriously injured."

    The statement pointed out: Fascist thugs and police forces colluded on the 15th to barbarically attack petitioners who were demonstrating in an orderly manner. This atrocity is the last resort of the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet. The Kishin Nobusuke cabinet has been isolated in the sea of anger of the Japanese people demanding the resignation of the Kishin Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the "Security Treaty".

    岸信介政府的暴行激起公愤
    日共指出政府必须承担罪责　社会党强烈要求岸信介下台
    “国民会议”号召人民加强斗争　总评决定发动大规模抗议
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天清晨发表声明，强烈抗议岸信介政府残害爱国示威学生，制造流血惨案的法西斯罪行。
    声明首先指出，这次血腥暴行是按照事先策划好的计划进行的。声明说，警察部队的“镇压行动是极端残酷和野蛮的。由于警察的袭击，一些学生被打死，很多人受了重伤。此外，警察把受重伤的学生和死亡者的尸体放在国会大厦的接待室里，不让国会议员和记者进入这个房间。他们企图以这种方式不让人民知道事实真相。”
    声明指出：“这是岸信介政府现在对人民反对安全条约运动所采取的一系列镇压行动之一。警察非法地和蛮不讲理地袭击了日本钢管公司工人的工会办事处，政法大学和东京教育大学学生自治会办公处，逮捕了学生，并且默许15日对示威者进行袭击的歹徒，从而助长了他们的气焰。15日对学生的袭击应该被认为是这种事先周密策划的一系列法西斯行动之一。”
    声明说：“我们谴责东京警视厅，认为它应该对谋杀事件负责。没有任何东西能够说明这种野蛮的谋杀和镇压是正当的。岸信介首相应该被谴责对这种事件负最大的责任，因为他一直拒绝对他自己的罪行承担责任。”
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天早晨就岸信介政府唆使法西斯暴徒野蛮打伤爱国示威者，制造流血惨案发表声明，强烈要求严惩凶手，要求卖国首相岸信介立即下台。
    声明说：“6月15日，反对安全条约第十八次全国统一行动是在阻止修改安全条约国民会议的领导下有秩序地进行的。在这次运动的过程中，大约在（下午）五点钟左右，一伙打着上有维新行动队标记的旗帜的暴徒突然把他们的卡车冲入大半是由安全条约批判会的文化工作者组成的游行者的队伍中。当时游行者正在国会大厦外面有秩序地示威着。还有几十个暴徒挥舞着带钉子的大木棍冲入示威者的人群。他们打伤了手无寸铁的文化工作者，其中包括男女演员。有人受了重伤，受伤人数达四人。
    声明指出：显然，这些法西斯暴徒是受岸信介集团指使的为艾森豪威尔的日本之行铺平道路的恶毒的特务。在暴徒行凶的过程中，在发生暴力地点附近值勤的警察部队坐视暴力活动，而没有采取任何行动来阻止暴徒使用暴力。我们不能不认为警察是暗中帮助这些暴徒。
    声明说，关于这次六·一五事件，日本共产党要求如下：
    一、罪犯和他们的头子应该受到严厉的惩办。
    二、发生这一事件的责任在于岸信介，岸信介应该立即辞职。
    三、政府应该立即采取措施保证将来不再发生类似事件。有关当局还应该对这一事件承担全部责任。
    日本社会党16日早晨发表声明强烈抗议岸信介政府的血腥镇压，要求岸信介下台。
    声明说，要求岸信介内阁下台已经成了全民的呼声，但是警察却勾结暴力团体袭击为提出这个要求而集会的学生和工人，不仅使女学生遭到死亡，还有许多人受伤，而且甚至使大学教授和路上行人受了伤。
    声明说：我们所担心的最坏的局面终于来到了，现在收拾局面的途径除了岸信介内阁下台以外没有别的办法。
    声明说：“如果岸首相有一点点人类的良心，就应该立刻辞职，我们用国民的名义强烈要求岸内阁下台。”
    社会党并且在昨天晚上举行了非法镇压对策委员会会议，决定要就这个惨案彻底追究岸信介政府的责任，并且提出控告。
    社会党并且决定要展开抗议运动。
    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”发言人15日晚上十一点在记者招待会上发表声明，严厉地谴责岸信介政府屠杀示威学生的法西斯暴行，并号召全体日本人民即刻采取更强有力的行动投入反对日美军事同盟条约、反对艾森豪威尔“访日”、要求岸信介内阁下台和立即解散国会的爱国斗争。
    声明说：“这是真正的谋杀。这是否定人权基础的空前的暴力行动。这是真正的法西斯主义的表现。我们对我们伟大事业的殉难者表示深切的哀悼。我们对岸信介内阁表示最激烈的愤慨。这次惨案的责任应完全由岸信介内阁承当。”声明指出，岸信介内阁是不折不扣的法西斯政府。
    声明详细地叙述了岸信介唆使法西斯暴徒残害示威者的经过。声明说：岸信介政府的警察“以最野蛮的办法袭击学生，至少已打死了两名学生，使数以百计的学生受了伤，很多人的伤势十分严重。”
    声明表示：“从16日一清早起，我们将对岸信介内阁和首都警察发动更强有力的抗议行动，唤醒全体日本人民投入行动，要求岸信介内阁立即集体辞职。”
    声明指出，如果艾森豪威尔敢于无视日本人民的愤慨情绪到日本鼓励岸信介内阁，“我们将以最强有力的抗议行动来回答他。我们宣布，我们将为死难学生为之而奋斗的事业进行斗争。”
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”已在15日深夜决定从16日上午十一时起在国会前面举行大规模的抗议集会，反对岸信介政府杀害学生的暴行。
    日本最强大的工会日本工会总评议会15日深夜发表声明说：“我们强烈抗议岸信介今天对反对安全条约的示威者所采取的野蛮行动。我们要求立即解散国会，并取消对艾森豪威尔访问日本的邀请。同时，我们要求严厉惩办杀害学生的警察。”
    “总评”并且宣布它将发动大规模的抗议运动。
    这项声明是由日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在记者招待会上宣布的。
    声明说：“反对安全条约的行动今天在日本各地有秩序地进行，共有五百八十多万人参加了这个行动。但是暴徒野蛮地袭击了作为全国性行动的一部分而在东京举行示威的请愿者，使数十名演员、工人和学生受了伤。当暴徒袭击示威者的时候，警察保持奇怪的沉默。
    然后，警察野蛮地攻击了对暴徒的残暴袭击表示抗议的学生。据说有几个学生被打死，几百名学生受了伤，其中有些人伤势严重。”
    声明指出：法西斯暴徒和警察部队在15日勾结在一起，野蛮袭击有秩序地进行示威的请愿者。这种暴行是岸信介内阁的最后的手段。在日本人民要求岸信介内阁辞职、解散国会和废除“安全条约”的愤怒的海洋中，岸信介内阁已经陷于孤立。
