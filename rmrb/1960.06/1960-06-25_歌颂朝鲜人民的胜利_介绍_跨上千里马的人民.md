    Praising the Victory of the Korean People
    ——Introducing "The People Riding the Chollima"
  　Lao She
    The People's Daily Publishing House has printed a good book – "The People Riding the Chollima."
    This book is not very long, but it is rich in content, and succinctly and comprehensively introduces the vigorous Chollima Movement in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After reading this book, we can not only know what our beloved Korean people have done in the Chollima Movement, but also know how they did it, because the book not only introduces the amazing achievements in industry, agriculture, education, and culture, but also tells the revolutionary spirit and heroic face of the people who made these achievements.
    This is a good book. It not only excites us, but also makes us feel very close, because we have always regarded the victory of the Korean people as our own victory. It inspires us and makes us deeply realize that the Korean people, under the guidance of the spirit of revolutionary tradition, are indeed invincible. They won battles on the battlefield, and they also won battles on all fronts of construction. We cheer for their victory, and we must learn from them. We sincerely congratulate and thank the Korean people! Yes, we must thank them, because Korea is the eastern outpost of the socialist camp. The American imperialist aggressor troops have not yet withdrawn from southern Korea. The increasing strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is of great contribution to the security and construction of the socialist camp!
    Reading the text and pictures in this book reminds me of my visit to Korea in 1953. At that time, Korean cities were still in ruins. The crimes of the American imperialists' crazy bombing are indeed unforgivable! Seeing those ruins makes people grit their teeth and hate the American imperialists! However, the evil American imperialists only destroyed the buildings in Pyongyang and other places, but did not frighten the Korean people. The poisonous aggressive atrocities only strengthened the Korean people's determination to resist and increased their strong and unyielding national glory. Yes, despite the broken tiles and rubble everywhere, the Korean people still stood tall! Heroic Korean brothers and sisters, how can we not love you! The stinking Dulles clamored that Korea had been bombed to nothing, but it was the American imperialists who returned in defeat, not Korea! People who are not afraid of imperialism, people who dare to fight against imperialism, will surely win! The Korean people have proved this truth to the oppressed people all over the world, proving that American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger!
    As soon as the war ended, the Korean people immediately sang revolutionary songs, picked up their tools, and rebuilt their rivers and mountains and reconstructed their motherland with selfless spirit! With the people, with ambition, and with the socialist ideal, why worry about not building cities, factories, schools, theaters... even more magnificent and splendidly! The victorious Korean people ended the three-year recovery plan and immediately began the first five-year plan. The Chollima Movement unfolded, and as a result, the five-year plan's total industrial output value plan was completed two and a half years ahead of schedule. What a great achievement! This proves how noble the qualities of the Korean people are and how heroic their spirit is!
    In this short article, I cannot fully praise our closest friends – the heroic Korean people, so please take a look at this collection of communications! It lists the facts of the great Chollima Movement. Facts speak louder than words. This book is a powerful eulogy! This praise makes us rejoice and makes the enemy tremble!

    歌颂朝鲜人民的胜利
    ——介绍“跨上千里马的人民”
  　老舍
    人民日报出版社印出一本好书——“跨上千里马的人民”。
    这本书篇幅不算多，可是内容丰富，扼要而全面地介绍了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的轰轰烈烈的千里马运动。看了这本书，我们不但能够知道在千里马运动中，我们所敬爱的朝鲜人民作了什么，而且知道那是怎样作的，因为书中不仅介绍了工业、农业、教育、文化等方面的惊人成就，而且也说出了作出这样成绩的人民的革命精神与英雄面貌。
    这是本好书。它不但使我们兴奋，而且感到非常亲切，因为我们一向以朝鲜人民的胜利当作自己的胜利啊。它使我们欢欣鼓舞，深刻地认识到在革命传统精神教导下的朝鲜人民的确是战无不胜的。在战场上打胜仗，在建设的各战线上还打胜仗，我们为他们的胜利而欢呼，我们也必须向他们学习，我们衷心地向朝鲜人民致贺致谢！是的，我们必须致谢，因为朝鲜是社会主义阵营的东方前哨阵地，美帝侵略军还没有撤出朝鲜南部，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的日益强大，对社会主义阵营的安全与建设有很大的贡献！
    看了这本书中的文字与图片，使我想起我在1953年访问朝鲜的光景。那时候，朝鲜的城市还是些废墟。美帝国主义疯狂轰炸的罪恶的确是万死难赎！看到那些废墟，使人没法子不咬牙切齿痛恨美帝！可是，万恶的美帝只炸毁了平壤与各地的建筑物，而没有吓倒了朝鲜人民。毒恶的侵略暴行只增强了朝鲜人民的抵抗决心，增加了他们坚强不屈的民族光彩。是啊，尽管到处是破瓦残砖，朝鲜人民却依然昂首雄立！英雄的朝鲜兄弟姊妹，我们怎能不热爱你们呢！遗臭万年的杜勒斯叫嚣朝鲜已被炸光，可是大败而归的是美帝，不是朝鲜！不怕帝国主义的人民，敢和帝国主义斗争的人民，必定胜利！朝鲜人民给全世界被压迫的人民证明了这条真理，证明了美帝不过是纸老虎这条真理！
    战争刚一结束，朝鲜人民马上高唱着革命歌曲，拿起工具，以忘我的精神，重整河山，再建祖国！有人民在，有雄心在，有社会主义的理想在，何愁不把城市、工厂、学校、剧院……修建得越发雄伟壮丽呢！胜利了的朝鲜人民结束了三年恢复计划，马上开始第一个五年计划。千里马运动展开，结果是提前两年半完成了五年计划的工业总产值计划。这是多么大的成就啊！这证明朝鲜人民的品质是多么高贵，气魄是何等豪迈啊！
    在这篇小文里，我无法尽情地歌颂我们最亲密的朋友——英雄的朝鲜人民，就请看看这本通讯集吧！它列举了伟大千里马运动的事实，事实胜于雄辩，这本书就是强有力的歌颂！这歌颂使我们欢欣鼓舞，使敌人颤抖！
