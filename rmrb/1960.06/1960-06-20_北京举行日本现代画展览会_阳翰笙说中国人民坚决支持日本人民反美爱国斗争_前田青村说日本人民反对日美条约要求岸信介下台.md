Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: A Japanese modern painting exhibition opened this morning at the Wenhua Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman He Xiangning, and more than 800 people from various circles attended the opening ceremony.

Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, spoke at the opening ceremony, warmly congratulating the opening of the exhibition and wishing it success. He said that the exhibition of Japanese artists' exquisite creations is a good opportunity for the Chinese people and artists to observe Japanese painting art. Yang Hansheng expressed admiration for the efforts made by Japanese painters in inheriting national painting traditions and expressing the modern life of the people. He pointed out that in the past ten years or so, due to the occupation of Japan by U.S. imperialism, not only have Japan's independence, sovereignty, and dignity been trampled upon, and the people's democratic and free rights been severely undermined, but Japan's national culture has also been unable to develop normally. The Chinese people have personally experienced that only by driving away U.S. imperialism, overthrowing the reactionary rule of their own country, and gaining true independence, can they better inherit and develop their national traditional culture and express the modern life of the people.

Yang Hansheng said: At present, the Japanese cultural circles have closely combined the struggle to eliminate the poison of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression and develop national and progressive culture with the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and have exerted unprecedentedly powerful combat effectiveness in the surging anti-American and anti-Kishi great struggle. It is impossible for U.S. imperialism to attempt to enslave the Japanese nation, which has a high cultural tradition, for a long time. We firmly believe that if the Japanese cultural circles unite and the broad masses of the Japanese people unite and continue to persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rule of its running dog Nobusuke Kishi clique, and open up a bright and splendid prospect for Japanese culture.

Yang Hansheng sternly condemned the towering crimes of the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary government in bloody suppressing Japanese demonstrating students and masses, and expressed cordial condolences to the injured students and masses, and deep condolences to the martyred heroes. He said, "The atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi government have aroused even stronger protest demonstrations by the Japanese people. Faced with this situation, the Nobusuke Kishi government was forced to announce the postponement of Eisenhower's visit to Japan. This is a preliminary victory for the Japanese people, and we are delighted with this victory."

Yang Hansheng said, "The people of China and Japan not only have a long-standing cultural connection, but also have a deep friendship. The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The people and artists of China and Japan should unite, support each other, and carry out a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. We regard the victory of the Japanese people's struggle as the victory of the Chinese people."

Maeda Seison, head of the Japanese painters delegation, said in his speech that he was very happy that Japanese modern paintings could be exhibited in Beijing. He said that Japanese painting has developed since a thousand years ago on the basis of maintaining close contact with Chinese painting. He hopes that through this exhibition, painters from China and Japan, who have inherited the traditions of Oriental painting, can join hands to create new Oriental paintings. At the same time, he also hopes to "strengthen the friendship and mutual trust between the people of the two countries and fight against all forces that hinder the friendship between the people of the two countries."

The head of the delegation said: "Now is the time when the Japanese people are opposing the new Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, demanding the Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, and fighting bravely for independence, democracy, freedom, and equality. The Chinese people have expressed sympathy and support for this struggle. Our Japanese painters delegation expresses gratitude for this, and at the same time believes that the people of Japan and China can further strengthen mutual friendship and trust."

Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, cut the ribbon for the exhibition. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman He Xiangning and other Japanese friends in Beijing visited the exhibition together. This is the largest Japanese art exhibition held in our country in recent years. "Asahi Shimbun" of Japan has made many efforts for the exhibition. A total of eighty-two outstanding works were exhibited. Although their styles, brushwork, and styles are different, they all have common strong national styles and colors.

Attending the opening ceremony were also famous people such as Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Xiruo, Li Dequan, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, Luo Jun, Zhang Shizhao, Mei Lanfang, Wu Zuoren, Liu Kaiqu, and Ye Qianyu.

Banshi Shiraishi, the deputy head of the Japanese painters delegation, all the members of the delegation, the Japanese writers delegation headed by Kobo Abe, and Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, also attended the opening ceremony.

    北京举行日本现代画展览会
    阳翰笙说中国人民坚决支持日本人民反美爱国斗争
    前田青村说日本人民反对日美条约要求岸信介下台
    新华社18日讯　日本现代画展览会今天上午在北京故宫文华殿开幕。
    陈毅副总理、何香凝副委员长，以及各界人士八百多人参加了开幕式。
    中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙在开幕式上讲话，热烈地祝贺这个展览会的开幕，并预祝它的成功。他说，日本美术家们精湛的创作的展出，是中国人民和美术家们观摩日本绘画艺术的一次良好机会。阳翰笙对日本画家在继承民族绘画传统和表现现代人民生活方面所作的努力，表示钦佩。他指出，近十多年，由于美帝国主义对日本的占领不仅使得日本的独立、主权和尊严横遭蹂躏，人民的民主自由权利备受摧残，日本的民族文化也得不到正常的发展。中国人民切身体验到，只有赶走美帝国主义，推翻本国的反动统治，获得了真正的独立，才能更好地继承和发扬本民族的传统文化和表现现代人民生活面貌。
    阳翰笙说：目前日本文化界把排除美帝国主义的文化侵略的毒害以及发展民族文化和进步文化的斗争和日本人民争取独立、和平、民主和中立的斗争紧密地结合在一起，在汹涌澎湃的反美反岸的伟大斗争中发挥出空前强大的战斗力。美帝国主义企图长期奴役具有高度文化传统的日本民族是不可能的。我们深信：日本文化界团结起来，日本广大人民团结起来继续坚持斗争，一定能够战胜美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介集团的反动统治，开辟日本文化光辉灿烂的前景。
    阳翰笙严厉谴责岸信介反动政府血腥镇压日本示威学生和群众的滔天罪行，并且对于遭受伤害的学生和群众表示亲切的慰问，对于牺牲的烈士表示沉痛的悼念。他说，“岸信介政府的暴行，激起了日本人民的更加强大的抗议示威运动。面对着这种形势，岸信介政府被迫宣布艾森豪威尔延期访日。这是日本人民的一个初步胜利，我们为这胜利而喜悦。”
    阳翰笙说，“中日两国人民不仅有着悠久的文化联系，而且有着深厚的友谊，中国人民是坚决支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的，中日两国人民和两国艺术家团结起来，互相支援，同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。我们看待日本人民斗争的胜利，当做中国人民的胜利。”
    日本画家代表团团长前田青村在讲话中对日本现代画能在北京展出感到非常高兴。他说，日本的绘画自一千几百年以来，是在和中国绘画保持着密切联系的基础上发展起来的。他希望通过这个展览会，使继承了东方绘画传统的中国、日本两国的画家们，携起手来创造新的东方绘画。同时并希望“加强两国人民之间的友好和互相的信任，向阻碍两国人民友好的一切势力作斗争。”
    团长说：“现在正是日本人民反对新日美安全条约，要求岸信介政府下台，为了争取独立、民主、自由、平等而勇敢斗争的时期。中国人民对这种斗争表示了同情和支持，我们日本画家代表团对此表示感谢，同时相信日、中两国人民能够进一步加强相互之间的友好和信任。”
    展览会由全国文联副主席茅盾剪彩。陈毅副总理、何香凝副委员长等和在京的日本朋友们一起进行了参观。这是历年来在我国举办的有关日本的艺术性展览中规模最大的一个。日本“朝日新闻”社曾为这个展览会的展出作了许多努力。展览会共览出了八十二幅优秀作品，虽然它们的风格、笔法、格调各不相同，但是它们都有着共同的浓厚的民族风格和色彩。
    参加开幕式的，还有廖承志、张奚若、李德全、楚图南、丁西林、罗俊、章士钊、梅兰芳、吴作人、刘开渠、叶浅予等著名人士。
    日本画家代表团副团长白石凡和全体团员，以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一等都出席了开幕式。
