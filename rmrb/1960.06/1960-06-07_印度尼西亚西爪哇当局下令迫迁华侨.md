Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, Jakarta News: The military authorities in West Java, Indonesia, on the 4th, issued another order to forcibly relocate foreign nationals in many parts of West Java.

According to this new decision announced by the wartime ruler of West Java, foreign nationals who still resided in cities such as Cimahi, Lembang, Batujajar, and Majalaya, and the Ujung Berung district before May 31st must move out of these places by June 30th at the latest. According to Antara News Agency, those foreign nationals who wish to return to their country are allowed to temporarily reside in their original places of residence, but the time limit shall be determined by the Commander of the Priangan Military District.

The West Java military authorities announced on May 31st that foreign nationals in the aforementioned places would not need to be relocated temporarily. However, this decision was changed after only a few days.

This decision by the West Java military authorities is another forced relocation action since the letter from Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio to Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi on March 26th this year. In the aforementioned letter, Subandrio stated that the Indonesian government "has actually implemented" the recommendations made by Chen Yi in his letter to Subandrio on March 15th to stop the forced relocation and other persecution of Overseas Chinese. The West Java military authorities have not stopped forcibly relocating Overseas Chinese since November last year.

    印度尼西亚西爪哇当局下令迫迁华侨
    新华社6日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局4日又下令在西爪哇许多地方强行外国侨民迁移。
    根据西爪哇战时掌权者宣布的这项新决定。5月31日以前还住在芝马墟、冷邦、八达拉冷和马惹拉惹等城市和乌戎伯伦区的外国侨民至迟必须在6月30日迁出这些地方。据安塔拉通讯社报道，那些希望回国的侨民被允许暂时住在他们原来居住的地方，但是时限应由勃良安州军分区司令决定。
    西爪哇军事当局曾经在5月31日宣布，上述地方的外国侨民暂时毋需迁移。但是没有几天又改变了这项决定。
    西爪哇军事当局这一决定是印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今年3月26日给中国外交部长陈毅的信以来又一迫迁行动。苏班德里约在上述信中曾经表示，印度尼西亚政府“实际上已经执行了”陈毅3月15日给苏班德里约的信中提出的停止对华侨的迫迁和其他迫害活动的建议。西爪哇军事当局去年11月以来就一直没有停止武力迫迁华侨的行动。
