Masters of Culture
    Cheng Li

    Workers and peasants were universally called "roughnecks" in the old society. However, in the new society, these "roughnecks" have transformed into literati and "scholars," becoming masters of culture.

    In Qinggu Village, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, there is a young man named Cheng Kuanniu. In the past, because he was illiterate, others called him "Muddlehead." After literacy education, he shed his illiteracy, learned to recognize more than 3,000 characters, and read more than 200 books, writing more than 30,000 words of "autobiography." The cotton experimental field he cultivated using newly learned techniques yielded 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu, twice as high as the local yield. Due to enlightenment in thought and increased awareness and active work, Cheng Kuanniu was elected by the masses as the production team leader and the principal of the team's Red and Expert School, and gloriously joined the Communist Party. Now, he is studying "On Contradiction."

    In our country, examples like Cheng Kuanniu transforming from "roughneck" to "scholar" are not isolated cases, but are ubiquitous. In all walks of life and at every post, there are theorists, professors, experts, engineers, scientific researchers, poets, and writers who have transformed from "roughnecks"… There is no need to cite many examples; it is enough to read Wang Lao Jiu's poems, look at the inventions and creations of comrades such as Su Guangming and Xu Chenglong, and read the large number of papers written by workers and peasants.

    Science, technology, and theory are originally summaries of labor practice. The broad masses of working people are the practitioners of production labor. They have rich practical experience, and they can summarize rich experience and elevate it to scientific and theoretical experience. Therefore, the working people are the masters of culture. But in the old society, all the rights of the working people were deprived. They had no share in reading and writing. What was left to them was suffering from hunger, oppression, and exploitation. Their wisdom was buried, and their talents were suppressed. "Heavenly gods," "fate," and superstition and inferiority firmly ruled their minds. However, our working people are unwilling to accept this situation. We rose up and overthrew the cannibalistic old society and established a supremely superior socialist system. The working people turned themselves around and became masters, becoming masters of the country, with the right, opportunity, and conditions to study theory, write articles, delve into science and technology, and give full play to their talents and use their wisdom. More importantly, Mao Zedong Thought armed the minds of the Chinese people, illuminated people's eyes, and opened the door to the wisdom of the working people. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the talents and wisdom of the working people that had been buried and suppressed for thousands of years have been fully utilized, emitting dazzling light, blossoming into brilliant flowers, and bearing plump fruits. "Roughnecks" have become "scholars," and are also red and expert, both literate and martial "scholars." These red "scholars" and local "scholars" are far more brilliant than those bourgeois foreign scholars.

    Some people doubt the real ability and learning of these "scholars," believing that they have insufficient cultural knowledge and cannot solve profound theoretical and cutting-edge technical problems. Let the facts answer! Let's take one example:

    In Mudanjiang Cement Plant, from January 1st to 21st, 1959, there were 21 accidents of all sizes, directly affecting the continuous leap forward in production. Under the leadership of the plant's Party Committee, the plant's Marxist-Leninist Research Office conducted an investigation and study of the accidents, clarified the main causes of the accidents, and gave lectures to all factory workers on topics such as "the relationship between the host machine and auxiliary machines," "the relationship between man and machine," and "the relationship between the part and the whole," theoretically improving everyone's understanding and summarizing the five-character mechanical maintenance experience of "listen, touch, observe, look, and ask," ensuring the safe operation of the machinery and overfulfilling the production tasks. See, they use the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and study practical problems, and solve practical problems. Isn't this real ability and learning? Aren't they truly "scholars" with both theory and practice?

    As early as ten years ago, Chairman Mao solemnly declared: "The era when the Chinese were regarded as uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." Now, our country has witnessed an unprecedented new upsurge of cultural revolution. In this upsurge, thousands upon thousands of "roughnecks" have shed their illiteracy, climbed the peaks of science, technology, and theory, and radiated dazzling light of wisdom; thousands upon thousands of old intellectuals are transforming their thinking, strengthening their training, and advancing rapidly toward becoming both red and expert. Countless facts at the National Conference of Heroes of Culture and Education prove that the day when "we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture" is just around the corner.

    文化的主人
    承里
    工人、农民，在旧社会一律被人称为“老粗”。然而在新社会，这些“老粗”却变成了文人、“秀才”，变成文化的主人了。
    山西省万荣县青谷村，有位青年叫程宽牛。从前，因为他一个字不识，别人叫他“闷块”，经过扫盲，他摘掉文盲帽子，认识三千多字，先后读了二百多本书，写了三万多字的“自传”。他用学到的新技术培育的棉花试验田，亩产皮棉一百三十斤，比当地产量高两倍。由于思想开窍，觉悟提高，工作积极，程宽牛被群众选为生产队长和队的红专学校校长，光荣地参加了共产党。现在，他正在学习“矛盾论”。
    在我们的国家里，像程宽牛这样由“老粗”变成“秀才”的事例，不是个别的，而是到处皆是。各行各业，各个岗位，都有由“老粗”变成的理论家、教授、专家、工程师、科学研究员、诗人、作家……例子不用多举，只要读读王老九的诗，看看苏广铭、徐呈龙等同志的发明创造，读读工人、农民写的大批论文就够了。
    科学技术和理论，本来是劳动实践的总结。广大劳动人民是生产劳动的实践者，他们有丰富的实践经验，他们可以总结丰富的经验，使之上升为科学的、理论的经验。因此，劳动人民是文化的主人。但在旧社会，劳动人民的一切权利被剥夺了，读书识字，没份。留给他们的是受饥饿、受压迫、受剥削。他们的智慧被埋没了，才能被压抑了。“天神”、“命运”和迷信、自卑，牢牢地统治着他们的头脑。但是，我们劳动人民是不甘心于这种状况的，我们起来推翻了吃人的旧社会，建立了优越无比的社会主义制度。劳动人民翻身作主，当了国家的主人，有权利有机会有条件学理论、写文章，钻研科学技术，尽情地发挥自己的才能，运用自己的智慧。更重要的是，毛泽东思想武装了我国人民的头脑，照亮了人们的眼睛，打开了劳动人民的智慧之门。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，劳动人民那被埋没、被压抑了千百年的才能和智慧，得到充分发挥，放出耀眼的光彩，开出灿烂的花朵，结出肥硕的果实。“老粗”变成了“秀才”，而且是又红又专、能文能武的“秀才”。这些红“秀才”、土“秀才”，远比那些资产阶级的洋秀才，要高明得多。
    有人怀疑这些“秀才”的真才实学，认为他们文化不高，科学知识不多，不能解决高深的理论和尖端技术问题。让事实来回答吧！举一个例子：
    牡丹江水泥厂，在1959年1月份，从1日到21日，全厂出现大小事故二十一次，直接影响着生产的持续跃进。在厂党委领导下，该厂的马克思列宁主义研究室，对事故进行了调查研究，弄清了发生事故的主要原因，以“主机和附机的关系”、“人和机器的关系”、“局部和整体的关系”等题目，向全厂职工作了讲演，从理论上提高了大家的认识并总结出“听、摸、察、看、问”五字的机械维修经验，保证了机械安全运转，超额完成了生产任务。看，他们运用毛泽东思想的武器分析研究实际问题，解决了实际问题，这不是真才实学吗？不是有理论有实际的真正“秀才”吗？
    早在十年以前，毛主席曾庄严地宣告：“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”现在，我国已经出现了一个空前的文化革命新高潮。在这个高潮里，千千万万的“老粗”摘掉文盲帽子，攀上科学、技术、理论高峰，放射出耀眼的智慧光彩；千千万万的旧知识分子正在改造思想，加强锻炼，向又红又专急进军。全国文教群英大会上无数的事实证明：“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”的日子，就在眼前了。
