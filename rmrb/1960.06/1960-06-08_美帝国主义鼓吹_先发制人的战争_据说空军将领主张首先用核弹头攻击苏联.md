Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: The American ruling clique is advocating a so-called "preemptive war," that is, the United States launching an attack first before a so-called "potential aggressor" launches an "attack."

According to American newspapers, the U.S. Air Force is the most vigorous in advocating the so-called "preemptive war." According to "Time" magazine, under this strategy, the U.S. government, after considering defense policy, "decided to abandon wasteful defensive systems and concentrate its strength on strengthening offensive missile and bomber forces." According to this magazine, under this strategy, the U.S. government would be able to launch an offensive without a declaration of war from Congress.

The House Appropriations Committee recently issued a report supporting the development of a "mixed force" of missiles and bombers to prepare for a "preemptive war." The report clamored that the United States "should maintain its armed forces in such a way and with such an understanding" that it would "launch an offensive before an aggressor attacks us or our allies." This means that the United States can launch a large-scale surprise attack on the Soviet Union and other countries at any time under the pretext of a non-existent so-called "aggression." Mahon, chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the committee, also ranted wildly that the United States should not reject this deterrent factor. He said that the United States "has no other completely reliable form of deterrence" besides the so-called "preemptive war." He clamored that the United States "should say less and less about (the United States not launching a war under any circumstances) and make the other party more and more uneasy."

The Washington "Evening Star" pointed out in a series of articles that many Air Force generals support a "preemptive policy," "believing that when war is clearly breaking out, we (the United States) will attack Russia first." The newspaper also said that the current U.S. government policy "is largely the Air Force's policy." The U.S. government is trying "to build a bomber and missile force that can drop a nuclear warhead on every important Soviet air defense facility, airport, missile launch site, bomb factory, and transportation center." The newspaper also said, "A careful reading of the government's statements also shows that the United States (government) has not ruled out launching a 'preemptive strike'... The President has said that if the survival of our country is clearly threatened, he will order all necessary actions to be taken."

In preparation for this war of aggression, the American ruling group is planning to increase military spending and develop new weapons. A French News Agency dispatch from Washington on May 31 said that "both houses of Congress, especially the Senate, are demanding increased military spending, and the Democratic leader in the Senate is demanding that military spending for the 1960-1961 fiscal year be increased by two to three billion dollars due to the failure of the summit conference."

In preparation for the so-called "preemptive war," the U.S. government also attaches particular importance to gathering intelligence about the Soviet Union. "Stone" magazine recently wrote that the U.S. spy planes' reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union were less for preventing a Soviet "sudden attack" than for the U.S. launching a surprise "preemptive war." The magazine said that U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff White once said that he did not know where the Soviet Union's new intercontinental missile bases were, and that "unless these bases can be destroyed first, the Soviet Union can fatally retaliate against an attacker." The magazine said, "That is why even our (American) preemptive war advocates do not dare to act now..."

The Washington "Star" even clamored that the United States "can simply decide how many cities the Soviet Union must lose. To be on the safe side, double the number (of such cities), and you get the number of population, industrial, and government administration centers," to prepare for a surprise attack by the United States on the Soviet Union.

### 美帝国主义鼓吹“先发制人的战争”  据说空军将领主张首先用核弹头攻击苏联

    美帝国主义鼓吹“先发制人的战争”
    据说空军将领主张首先用核弹头攻击苏联
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国统治集团中正在鼓吹所谓“先发制人的战争”，即在所谓“可能的侵略者”发动“袭击”之前，由美国首先发动进攻。
    据美国报刊报道，关于所谓“先发制人的战争”以美国空军鼓吹最力。据“时代”周刊说，根据这种战略，美国政府在对防务政策进行了考虑之后，“决定放弃浪费金钱的防御性制度，而把力量集中于加强攻击性的导弹和轰炸机阵容”。据这家周刊说，根据这种战略，美国政府将无需经过国会宣战而即可发动进攻。
    众议院拨款委员会不久前发表一项报告，支持发展由导弹和轰炸机组成的“混合力量”以准备“先发制人的战争”的主张。报告叫嚷美国“应当以这样一种方式和在这样一种谅解下来维持它的武装部队”，就是在所谓“侵略者攻击我们或我们的盟国之前（由美国）先发动进攻”。这就是说，美国可以随时借口根本就不存在的所谓“侵略”，对苏联和其它国家发动大规模的突袭。这个委员会的国防小组委员会主席马洪还大发战争狂说，美国不应该拒绝这种威慑因素。他说，除了所谓“先发制人的战争”以外，美国“没有其他完全可靠的威慑形式”。他叫嚷美国“应当越来越少说有关（美国在任何情况下都不会发动战争）那一类的话，并让对方越来越坐立不安”。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”在一篇连载文章中指出，许多空军将领都支持“先发制人的政策”，“认为当战争显然正在发动起来的时候，我们（美国）将首先攻击俄国”。这家报纸还说，目前美国政府的政策“大体上就是空军的政策”。美国政府正力图“建立一支轰炸机和导弹力量，这支力量能够在苏联每一个重要的空军防御设施、机场、导弹发射场、炸弹工厂、交通运输中心都投下一枚核弹头”。报纸还说，“仔细阅读政府的声明也可以看出美国（政府）一直没有排除进行一次‘先发制人的攻击，……总统就曾说过，如果我国的生存显然受到威胁，他将下令采取一切必要的行动。”
    为了准备这种侵略战争，美国统治集团正打算追加军事开支，发展新式武器。法新社5月31日从华盛顿发出的一条消息说，“国会两院、特别是参议院都要求增加军事开支，参议院的民主党领袖正要求，由于最高级会议的失败，1960—1961财政年度的军事开支应增加二十亿到三十亿美元。”
    为了准备所谓“先发制人的战争”，美国政府还特别重视搜集有关苏联的情报的工作。“斯通”周刊不久前一期写道，美国间谍飞机对苏联的侦察飞行与其说是为了预防苏联的“突然袭击”，还不如说是为了美国发动偷袭的“先发制人战争”。这家周刊说，美国空军参谋长怀特曾经说他不知道苏联的新的洲际导弹基地在那里，而“除非这些基地可以首先予以摧毁，苏联是可以致命地对一个攻击者进行报复的。”周刊说，“正因为如此，甚至我们（美国）的先发制人战争鼓吹者现在还不敢动手……”
    华盛顿“明星报”甚至叫嚷，美国“可以简单地决定一下苏联损失不得的城市有多少。为了保险起见可以把（这种城市的）数字增加一倍，这样就得到这样一些居民、工业和政府管理的中心的数字”，以准备美国对苏联的突然进攻。
