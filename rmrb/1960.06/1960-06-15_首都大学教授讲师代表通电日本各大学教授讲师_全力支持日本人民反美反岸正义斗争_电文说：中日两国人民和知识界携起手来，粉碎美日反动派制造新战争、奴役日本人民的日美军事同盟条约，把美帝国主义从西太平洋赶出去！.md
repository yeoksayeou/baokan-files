Xinhua News Agency, 14th. A telegram from representatives of professors and lecturers from universities in Beijing to professors and lecturers from universities in Japan. The full text is as follows:
　　As the Japanese people hold high the banner of anti-American patriotism and launch the 18th unified action, representatives of professors and lecturers from Beijing University, Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, Normal University, the Iron and Steel Institute, and other institutions of higher learning held a cordial discussion with the Japanese literary delegation headed by Mr. Hiroshi Noma. We have been watching with admiration the struggle of the Japanese literary and intellectual circles, together with the Japanese people, against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." Your struggle is not only related to the future of Japan, but also has great significance for maintaining peace in Asia and the world. On behalf of the professors and lecturers of universities in Beijing, we extend our highest respect to the professors, lecturers, and researchers of universities and research institutions in Japan who are actively involved in the just struggle against American imperialism and for patriotism!
　　Currently, Kishi Nobusuke is plotting to use despicable and shameless means to pass the aggressive US-Japan military alliance treaty in the Senate, which sells out national interests, opposes China and the Soviet Union, and opposes Asian countries, before Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The enraged Japanese people, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet," "Defend Democracy," "Dissolve the Diet," "Smash the US-Japan Security System," "Oppose Eisenhower's Visit to Japan," and "Yankees Go Home," have launched a more turbulent struggle. In recent days, the vast number of Japanese academics have increasingly felt pained by the fascist crimes of the US-Japan reactionaries in preparing for a new war and trampling on democratic freedom. You have not only shouted loudly, denounced the US-Japan reactionaries, and encouraged the people's fighting spirit, but also taken to the streets, the Diet, and the US Embassy, joining the people of all strata in Japan to participate in various mass struggles, putting the US-Japan reactionaries in an unprecedentedly embarrassing and besieged situation.
　　The Chinese people and intellectuals, who have suffered from the aggression and oppression of US imperialism and Japanese militarism, and are currently engaged in a resolute struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys, have deep sympathy for the struggle of the Japanese people and patriotic intellectuals against US imperialism and its puppet, Kishi Nobusuke. We are determined to continue to fully support the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.
　　The people and intellectuals of China and Japan should join hands to smash the US-Japan reactionaries' scheme to create a new war and enslave the Japanese people through the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and drive US imperialism out of the West Pacific!
　　Long live world peace!
Representatives of Professors and Lecturers from Universities in Beijing

    首都大学教授讲师代表通电日本各大学教授讲师
    全力支持日本人民反美反岸正义斗争
    电文说：中日两国人民和知识界携起手来，粉碎美日反动派制造新战争、奴役日本人民的日美军事同盟条约，把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去！
    新华社14日讯　北京各大学的教授和讲师代表给日本各大学教授和讲师的通电。全文如下：
    当着日本人民高举反美爱国的旗帜，展开第十八次统一行动的时候，我们北京大学、中国人民大学、清华大学、师范大学、钢铁学院等高等学校的教授、讲师代表，和以野间宏先生为首的日本文学家代表团举行了亲切的座谈。我们一直怀着满腔钦佩的心情，注视着日本文学界和知识界同日本人民一道进行的反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争。你们的斗争，不仅关系到日本的前途，而且对维护亚洲与世界和平也具有重大的意义。我们代表北京各大学的教授、讲师谨向积极投入反美爱国正义斗争的日本各大学、研究机关的教授、讲师以及研究人员，致以崇高的敬意！
    目前，岸信介正在策划于艾森豪威尔访问日本之前，使用卑鄙无耻的手段，在参议院通过出卖民族利益的、以中苏为敌、以亚洲各国为敌的侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。激怒了的日本人民，高呼“打倒岸内阁”、“保卫民主”、“解散国会”、“粉碎日美安全体制”、“反对艾森豪威尔访日”、“美国佬滚回去”的口号，掀起了更加汹涌澎湃的斗争。这些天来，广大的日本学术界人士，对美日反动派准备新战争，蹂躏民主自由的法西斯罪行，越来越感到痛心疾首，你们不仅大声疾呼，声讨美日反动派，鼓舞人民斗志，而且走向街头，走向国会，走向美国大使馆，同日本各阶层人民一起，参加了各种群众斗争，使日美反动派陷入空前狼狈和四面楚歌的境地。
    曾经遭受美帝国主义和日本军国主义的侵略和压迫，并且正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决斗争的中国人民和知识分子，对于日本人民和爱国知识分子反对美帝国主义及其傀儡岸信介的斗争，有着深切的同情。我们决心继续全力支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争。
    中日两国人民和知识界携起手来，粉碎美日反动派制造新战争、奴役日本人民的日美军事同盟条约，把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去！
    世界和平万岁！
    北京各大学教授和讲师代表
