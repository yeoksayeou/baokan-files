Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th June: The "Daily Mail" editorial on the 16th stated that the anti-American demonstrations in Japan have made the Western world's "prospects bleak." The newspaper said, "It is mainly due to the (American) groping policies and wishful thinking that have formed this tragic predicament."

    The newspaper said that the Japanese people's demonstrations "are directed against the new Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, against the Kishi Nobusuke government that signed the treaty, and against the American government."

    It said: The Japanese people's "role of being manipulated in international affairs is coming to an end, and they don't like this situation. For a decade, although Japan has been nominally a sovereign country, it has actually been an occupied country under American protection."

    The newspaper said that the Japanese are worried that they might be dragged into another war. They are even more worried because the Soviet Union has stated that it will strike at the bases of American spy planes - because some U-2 aircraft are stationed in Japan. The newspaper emphasized that today, "the United States finds itself opposed and unwelcome not only in Japan, but also in South America, Cuba, and elsewhere."

    James Cameron wrote in the "News Chronicle" on the 16th that when Haggerty, who was "chased across the airport and finally rescued by helicopter after overcoming various obstacles," called the Japanese demonstrators "unpatriotic" left-wing anti-Americans, he "pathetically exposed the extent to which Washington does not understand the East, especially Japan." It is for this reason that Eisenhower "faces a painful and futile test."

    He said, "The United States realized too late" that "many people in Japan have long been disgusted with being dependent on others, being guarded, and being manipulated at will."

    The "News Chronicle" published an editorial on the same day stating that "Japan is experiencing the most serious crisis since the war, and its international impact may be very serious." It said, "To insist on dismissing the demonstrators as Communists is to ignore the facts." It also said, "The security treaty will impose military obligations on this country, while the descendants of the Hiroshima disaster hope to never bear such military obligations again."

    日本反美斗争高涨　西方世界前景暗淡
    英国报纸埋怨美国外交政策招致严重后果
    新华社伦敦16日电　“每日邮报”16日的社论说，日本的反美示威使西方世界“前景惨淡”。报纸说，“主要是由于（美国）瞎摸的政策和胡想出来的计划，才形成了这种悲惨的困境。”
    这家报纸说，日本人民的示威“是针对新日美安全条约，针对签订这个条约的岸信介政府和针对美国政府的。”
    它说：日本人民“在国际事务中听人摆布的角色即将结束，他们不喜欢这种情况。十年来，日本虽然名义上是一个主权的国家，但是实际上是在美国保护下的被占领国家。”
    这家报纸说，日本人担心他们可能被硬拖入另一场战争中。由于苏联声明要打击美国间谍飞机的基地，他们就更加担心了——因为有些U—2型飞机驻扎在日本。这家报纸强调说，今天，“美国发现自己不但在日本，而且在南美、古巴等地都遭到反对和不受欢迎。”
    詹姆斯·凯麦隆16日在“新闻纪事报”上撰文说，当“越过机场时被人追逐，跳过种种障碍终于侥幸被直升飞机救出的”哈格蒂把日本示威者叫做“不忠于祖国”的左翼反美分子时，他“可悲地暴露出华盛顿不了解东方，特别是不了解日本，达到何种程度”。正是由于这个缘故，艾森豪威尔“面临痛苦的和徒劳无益的考验”。
    他说，“美国过晚地认识到”，“日本有许多人老早就厌恶相继仰人鼻息、受人监护和任意摆布。”
    “新闻纪事报”同日发表社论说，“日本经历着战后最严重的危机，其国际影响可能非常严重。”它说“硬说示威者都是共产党人而加以摈斥，就是无视事实。”它又说，“安全条约将把军事义务强加于这个国家，而广岛灾难的后代却希望永远不再承担这种军事义务。”
