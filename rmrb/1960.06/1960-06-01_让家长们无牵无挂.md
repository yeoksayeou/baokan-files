Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Letting Parents Be Free From Worry
    Xia Weimin, Secretary of the CPC Dalian City Zhongshan District Committee

    This year, women on the streets of Zhongshan District, Dalian City, have launched a mass upsurge in establishing childcare services. Many people are busy cleaning houses, installing equipment, surveying the needs of children for childcare, and hiring childcare workers. In just over a month, a large number of childcare organizations have been established. The number of formal childcare organizations built by the district on the streets has increased from the original 56 to 146, and many simple childcare organizations have also been set up. The number of children cared for has increased from the original 4,100 to more than 25,500. Most of the preschool children under the age of seven are living a happy collective life in childcare organizations. These childcare organizations include large-scale kindergartens, nurseries in residents' homes, "kang" (platform bed) childcare groups, and simple kindergartens. Small-scale children's libraries, children's canteens, children's bathhouses, and barbershops have also been established. Because childcare organizations are ubiquitous, parents can drop off and pick up their children without even leaving their street, and some can even do so without leaving their courtyard.

    The emergence of childcare organizations like bamboo shoots after a spring rain has satisfied the long-standing urgent desire of the majority of housewives, freeing them from their stoves and aprons, and allowing them to put on neat work clothes and step onto the labor production front. As a result, people are all smiles and full of joy, as if they were celebrating a happy event.

    Since the childcare problem was solved, housewives have demonstrated tremendous power on the production front. In the past two months, over 18,000 female reinforcements have been added to the district's street-run industries and collective welfare undertakings. The broad masses of women are creating much valuable wealth for society on the production front; the bricks and tiles they produce are used to build high-rise buildings and factories; the fishing nets they skillfully weave catch full loads of fish and shrimp, providing urban and rural people with improved living conditions; the exquisite shell carvings they make enrich people's cultural and artistic lives; and many large factories and shops have obtained mechanical parts, emery, clothing, and toys from them...

    Lin Lanrong, a resident of Taoyuan Street, after sending her children to childcare, and Yu Bangfeng ran around looking for production opportunities. Although they didn't find any after dozens of attempts, they didn't lose heart. Later, they contacted an eyeglasses factory and agreed to let them process eyeglasses for export. Some people said they couldn't do it, but they replied, "We will do it no matter how difficult it is. If others can do it, we can do it; if others can't do it, we will do it. We will never be content to eat for free all our lives." They didn't have the technology and hadn't used machines, so they went to the factory to learn from masters and work as apprentices. Without a factory building, they carried out production in a glass cellar; without tools, they borrowed them from everywhere. No matter how many difficulties they encountered, they persevered and finally established a small processing factory with 23 people. Now, they can process and assemble more than 200 dozen eyeglasses every day.

    Due to the rapid development of production, childcare organizations, and many collective welfare undertakings, people's mental outlook has undergone fundamental changes, and neighbors are united and help each other. Because women are no longer burdened by their children, they have actively participated in cultural studies, bringing about a surge in the cultural revolution. In the Qingniwaqiao People's Commune, more than 1,200 housewives are studying culture; in the past few months, more than 500 people have shed their illiteracy, and more than 200 people have raised their educational level from primary school to higher primary school. Furthermore, some women have organized themselves to study Chairman Mao's works on a regular basis.

    In the process of establishing childcare organizations, the communist style of "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself" has emerged everywhere. If there are no houses, everyone thinks of ways; if there are no tools, everyone looks for them; if there is no equipment, everyone contributes; if there is no manpower, everyone helps. Communist Party member Liu Honghua, a mother of four, had already set up a nursery in her own home, caring for 19 children. When the streets began to establish childcare organizations on a large scale, she proposed adding another childcare class in her son's room. Zhao Yongxie, a 60-year-old worker, saw that the nurseries lacked benches, so during his time off, he used some waste wood to make 19 small benches and sent them to the nurseries. In this way, through collective wisdom and effort, starting from scratch and making do with whatever was available, a large number of childcare organizations were established. When some nurseries were first established, the children often fought with each other, and the new childcare workers were unable to manage them well and were not at ease in their work. However, under the leadership of older kindergartens and large nurseries, they helped the new nurseries establish a regular daily routine for the children, arranged homework and games on time, taught the children to sing and dance, educated the children to be polite, and helped the new childcare workers wash the children from head to toe. Neighbors saw that some dirty and naughty children changed their ways within a few days of entering the nursery, and everyone praised the nursery for doing a good job. Parents are truly free from worry.

### 让家长们无牵无挂

    让家长们无牵无挂
    中共辽宁旅大市中山区委书记　夏维民
    旅大市中山区街道妇女，今年掀起了群众性的兴办托儿事业的高潮。许多人忙着收拾屋子、安置设备、调查托儿所对象和聘请保育员；只用了一个多月的时间，办起了大批托儿组织。全区从街道上建起来的正规托儿组织从原有五十六个发展到一百四十六个，并搞起了许多简易托儿组织。收托儿童从原有四千一百多名，增加到二万五千五百多名；七周岁以前的学龄前儿童大半在托儿组织中过着幸福的集体生活。这些托儿组织有规模较大的幼儿园，有设在居民家里的托儿所，有炕头托儿组，有简易幼儿园，并且建立了小规模的儿童图书馆和儿童食堂、儿童浴池和理发室。由于托儿组织林立，家长们接送儿童可以不出街，有的还可以不出院。
    托儿组织像雨后春笋般出现，满足了广大家庭妇女长期以来的迫切愿望，使他们无牵无挂地离开锅台，解下围裙，换上整洁的工作服，纷纷走上了劳动生产岗位。因此人们笑逐颜开，喜气洋洋，如同办喜事一样。
    自从解决了托儿问题，家庭妇女在生产战线上显示了巨大的威力。二个多月来，我区街办工业和集体福利事业增添了一万八千多名妇女生力军。广大妇女在生产战线上，为社会创造了许多宝贵财富；她们生产的砖瓦，盖起了一座座高楼和厂房；她们巧手织成的渔网，捕获满舱鱼虾，供给城乡人民改善生活；她们精心制做的贝雕工艺品，丰富了人民的文化艺术生活；许多大工厂和商店从她们手中得到了机械零件、金刚砂、服装和玩具……。
    桃源街居民林兰荣把几个孩子送进托儿所以后，和于帮凤俩东奔西跑找生产门路，虽然寻找几十次没有找到，也不灰心；后来和眼镜厂联系，答应让她们加工出口的眼镜；有些人说她们干不了，她们回答说：“有天大的困难也要干，只要别人能干的我们就能干，别人不能干的我们也要干，决不甘心一辈子白吃饭。”她们不会技术，也没用过机器，就到工厂拜师傅，当学徒；没有厂房就在玻璃窖子里进行生产，没有工具就到处去借。多少道难关没挡住她们，终于办起了二十三个人的小加工厂；现在，每天能加工配制二百多打眼镜。
    由于生产和托儿组织和许多集体福利事业的迅速发展，人们的精神面貌发生了根本变化，邻里之间互相团结和帮助。由于妇女们不受孩子拖累，因而积极参加了文化学习，带来了文化革命的高涨；青泥洼桥人民公社就有一千二百多名家庭妇女学文化；几个月来，有五百多人摘掉了文盲帽子，二百多人由初小文化程度提高到高小文化水平，并且有些妇女还组织起来按时学习毛主席著作。
    在办托儿组织中，到处出现了“把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”的共产主义风格。没有房子，大家想办法；没有工具，大家找；没有设备，大家凑；没有人力，大家出。共产党员刘鸿华，是一个四个孩子的母亲，本来她已经在自己家里办了一个托儿所，收托十九名儿童；当街道上大办托儿组织的时候，她又提出在她儿子住的房间增加一个托儿班。六十岁的老工人赵永协，看到托儿所缺少凳子，就趁自己休班，用些废木料，动手做了十九个小凳送给托儿所用。就这样，群策群力，白手起家，因陋就简，办起了大批的托儿组织。有的托儿所刚一成立时，孩子们经常互相打闹，新保育员管理不好，不安心工作。但是在老幼儿园和大托儿所的带动下，帮助新托儿所给孩子们建立了有规律的生活制度，按时上作业和游戏，教会了儿童唱歌、舞蹈，教育儿童讲礼貌，又帮助新保育员把孩子们从头到脚洗得干干净净。邻里们看到有的脏孩子和淘气孩子进所不几天，都变了样，个个称赞托儿所办得好，家长们真是无牵无挂了。
