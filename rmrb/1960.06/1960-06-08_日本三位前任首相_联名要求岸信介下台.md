Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th -- Three former Japanese prime ministers today demanded the immediate resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the holding of general elections under the supervision of a temporary government.

The three former prime ministers are: Naruhiko Higashikuni, Tetsu Katayama, and Tanzan Ishibashi. They made this demand in an open letter to Nobusuke Kishi. The letter was delivered to Chief Cabinet Secretary Etsusaburo Shiina at the Prime Minister's official residence this afternoon by former Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, Saburo Endo.

The open letter stated: To resolve the current political crisis, there is no other way than for Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to bear full responsibility for it.

The letter said: "What we mean by this is that you should resign immediately, and furthermore, the Diet should be dissolved after a temporary cabinet to hold elections is formed."

The three former prime ministers also jointly issued a letter to the Japanese people, calling on the people to support their suggestions to Nobusuke Kishi. The letter to the people said: "At this critical moment, the issue of Nobusuke Kishi's resignation should be placed before all other measures that should be taken."

    日本三位前任首相
    联名要求岸信介下台
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本的三位前任首相今天要求岸信介内阁立即辞职和在临时政府的监督下举行大选。
    这三位前首相是：东久迩稔彦、片山哲和石桥湛山。他们在一封给岸信介的公开信中提出了这个要求。这封信是由前日本陆军中将远藤三郎于今天下午在首相官邸交给内阁官房长官椎名悦三郎的。
    这封公开信说：要解决目前的政治危机，除了岸信介首相对它承担完全的责任以外，别无其他办法。
    信中说：“我们说这话的意思是你应当立即辞职，再一点是在举行大选的临时内阁组成以后应当把国会解散。”
    三位前首相还联名发表告日本人民书，要求人民支持他们对岸信介的建议。告人民书说：“在这个决定性的时刻，岸信介辞职问题应当列在一切其他应当采取的措施的前面。”
