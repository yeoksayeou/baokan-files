Eisenhower Gets a Cold Shoulder
Chi Beiou poem, Ying Tao drawing

　　On the way to visit Japan,
　　The lackey suddenly came to advise stopping.
　　Disrupting the itinerary is a small matter,
　　Losing face is impossible to make up for.
　　This cold shoulder,
　　Is really hard to swallow.
　　Thinking it over, one can calm down,
　　Although hitting a wall doesn't count as losing.
　　Those beaten to death or injured are only a few hundred,
　　The police prepared to mobilize number twenty-five thousand;
　　It can be seen that those who oppose are only a minority,
　　Those who welcome are the majority.
　　Thinking about it again, the mood is completely calm,
　　Not going to Japan may not be a blessing.
　　To avoid being as embarrassed as Hagerty,
　　To avoid getting hit by tomatoes, eggs, and potatoes.
　　The accompanying thugs must also be happy,
　　The American insurance company is also delighted.

    艾森豪威尔尝了闭门羹
    池北偶诗　英鞱画去访日本已在中途，奴才忽然来劝止步。打乱行程事情还小，丢了面子无法弥补。这杯闭门羹，实在难下肚。回心一想也就息怒，虽然碰壁并不算输。打死打伤的不过几百人，准备出动的警察有两万五；可见反对的只是少数，欢迎的才是多数。再想一下心情完全平复，不去日本未必非福。免得像哈格蒂那样难堪，少挨些番茄、鸡蛋、马铃薯。随行的打手也必高兴，美国保险公司不亦乐乎。（附图片）
