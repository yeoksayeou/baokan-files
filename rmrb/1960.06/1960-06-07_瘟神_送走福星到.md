    "The Plague God" is Sent Away, the God of Fortune Arrives
    Representative of Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province Yang Longxiang
    Under the kind concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Yujiang County has made remarkable achievements in eliminating schistosomiasis and other parasitic diseases.
    Yujiang County is located in the eastern part of Jiangxi Province, with an area of 1,021 square kilometers. The north and south are mostly mountainous, and the central part is a plain. The Baita River runs through Yujiang County, with green mountains and clear waters on both banks and fertile land. However, in this rich and beautiful area, schistosomiasis was prevalent. Snails that transmit schistosomiasis were distributed over 782,000 square meters, and more than 35,100 people were severely threatened by schistosomiasis, with more than 4,300 patients, accounting for 12.5% of the epidemic area's population.
    In the past, due to the long-term bloody rule and exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, who turned a blind eye to the suffering of the people, schistosomiasis spread and harmed people more each year. In the past few decades, no less than 3,000 people lost their lives due to this disease. The mortality rate increased, and the birth rate decreased year by year. Many villages were destroyed as a result. For example, in Jiantou Village, which had more than 500 households, only 15 households remained. People who contracted schistosomiasis became thin and weak, with reduced labor power; in severe cases, their bellies swelled like drums, they became emaciated, lost their labor power, and many fertile fields were abandoned. The people described the situation at that time as: "A hoe weighs two pounds of iron, and you want to rest as soon as you pick it up"; "You need a stick to support yourself when going to the fields, and you want to sleep before you even get there"; "Lantian Slope, a large plain, where the grass grows taller than people, and wild animals roam everywhere." Coupled with the reactionary government's heavy taxes and levies, and the feudal landlords' cruel exploitation, the peasants were plagued by poverty and disease, and their lives were extremely miserable. There was a ballad circulating here that described the tragic life at that time: "No grain in the house, no clothes on the people, the plague god won't leave, and death is hard to escape."
    Dig Out the Roots of Disease, Send Away the Plague God, People Live Long and the Harvest is Bountiful
    After liberation, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee's Nine-Person Group for the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis and the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, in order to eradicate the roots of disease and poverty, while vigorously restoring and developing production, we established schistosomiasis prevention stations, resolutely implemented the policy of active prevention and treatment, and adopted comprehensive prevention and treatment measures. We organized and mobilized the broad masses to launch a magnificent and large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and treatment campaign. In the spring of 1956, with the upsurge of cooperativization and the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development, the Yujiang County Party Committee proposed a grand plan to "prepare for half a year, fight for one year, and finish up in half a year" to eradicate schistosomiasis within two years. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally supervised the battle, and the broad masses of people actively participated in the battle. At the peak of the snail eradication campaign, more than 20,000 people participated. After two years of hard work, a total of 397 li of new ditches were dug and old ditches were filled, and some ponds were filled in. After the snails were eradicated from the filled-in old ditches and ponds, they were all turned into fertile fields, totaling more than 1,500 mu. The newly dug ditches and ponds formed a water conservancy and irrigation system, which brought water from the Baita River into the newly built canals to irrigate the often drought-stricken fields, providing a reliable guarantee for production. At the same time, every patient received treatment and recovered their health. Most of them were the main force in production, and the labor efficiency increased from more than two mu of land per laborer in the past to more than ten mu.
    With the vigorous eradication of schistosomiasis and the improvement of the people's health, the face of the epidemic area has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, sparsely populated and barren areas are now places where people live long and the harvest is bountiful, and the singing of happiness can be heard everywhere. Women who had not given birth for many years now have babies; people who had been single for decades have now established happy families; villages that were about to be destroyed are now filled with smoke and prosperity; areas that used to be grain-deficient have become surplus grain areas. For example, in the past, the Gongtang Brigade was a severely epidemic area of schistosomiasis, with few laborers and weak bodies. Every year, they barely managed one planting and one harvest with the help of relatives and friends or by hiring short-term workers. By 1957, not only was there no shortage of labor, but more than 7,000 workdays were left over for sideline production activities. Grain production increased by 23.8% in 1957 compared to 1956, and the brigade changed from a grain-deficient brigade to a surplus grain brigade. People who used to "want to rest as soon as they picked up a hoe" have now become vigorous and energetic forces. They have great energy in the Great Leap Forward in Production, working from morning till night, and the more they work, the more energetic they become. An unprecedented scene of abundant harvests and prosperous livestock appeared in the entire epidemic area. The people sang from the bottom of their hearts:
    The Party's leadership is truly good, and it performs meritorious deeds for the people everywhere;
    Dig out the roots of poverty and the roots of disease, send away the "plague god" and the god of fortune arrives.
    In May 1958, schistosomiasis, which had been prevalent in our county for many years, was eradicated, the "plague god" was sent away, and the people's long-cherished dream was realized. We won the first red flag in the country for eradicating schistosomiasis. This victory should first of all be attributed to the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. It was the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao who called on us to eliminate schistosomiasis, organized and mobilized the people in our epidemic area to fight tenaciously against schistosomiasis. After our county achieved great success in eradicating schistosomiasis and created a miracle that no capitalist country could have dreamed of, Chairman Mao wrote a brilliant poem, praising the place that was once "thousands of villages overgrown with weeds and people defecating, tens of thousands of households desolate and ghosts singing," and is now a paradise on earth where "the spring breeze sways tens of thousands of willows, and the six hundred million people of China are all like Emperors Shun and Yao." This kind of concern from Chairman Mao is a great inspiration and encouragement to the entire Party and the entire people of Yujiang County. Now, on the basis of achieving a great victory in eradicating schistosomiasis, the people of our county, with the spirit of continuous revolution, are riding the wind and waves, and launching a massive and vigorous patriotic health campaign throughout the county, centered on eliminating the "four pests," promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, to further consolidate the achievements of schistosomiasis prevention, improve the environmental sanitation of the epidemic area, and launch an all-out battle against hookworm disease, filariasis, and other diseases that endanger the people's health.
    According to repeated investigations, there are 11,429 hookworm disease patients, 3,620 filariasis patients, 4,733 malaria patients, and 457 venereal disease patients in the county, which seriously endanger the people's health and affect the development of production. For example, in Xiashan Brigade of Maquan Commune, filariasis patients account for 60% of the total population. Patients have thick lower limbs and difficulty walking, and are unable to work in the fields for about seven to ten days each month. Under the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, the Yujiang County Party Committee, on the one hand, instructed health workers to do a good job in investigation and publicity and education, and on the other hand, held training classes to train new health backbones and pass on the relevant techniques for preventing and treating hookworm disease and other diseases to the masses. Immediately afterwards, a large-scale campaign was launched throughout the county to relocate toilets, pigsties, and cattle pens, and to implement "three no-nos" outdoors (no garbage, no sludge, no standing water) and "six clean surfaces" indoors, completely changing the environmental sanitation of urban and rural areas, completely destroying the breeding grounds of pests, and also eliminating a large number of mosquitoes, flies, rats, bedbugs, cockroaches, and other pests. The good habit of everyone paying attention to hygiene has become a common practice: not spitting everywhere, not urinating and defecating everywhere, and fruit peel boxes and garbage collection points have been established in every village, and each person has a towel and a toothbrush. At the same time, a rural medical and health care network was established. Communes have hospitals, production brigades have health centers, and production teams have three members: midwives, health workers, and environmental sanitation workers. Combining production, combining life, and adopting comprehensive prevention and treatment measures, the techniques for preventing and treating diseases are passed on to the masses, and a fierce attack is launched on hookworm disease and other diseases in an all-round way. As of now, hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria, and venereal diseases have been basically eliminated in the county, effectively protecting the health of the people and promoting the development of production. For example, in Chengshang Village, Yangxi Commune, after eliminating hookworm disease and other diseases and changing from a "dirty village" to a "hygienic village," the labor attendance rate has greatly increased, and grain production increased by 56% last year. The masses praised: "The East is Red, the rising sun, the Party's call inspires the people, men and women, old and young, all go into battle together, changing Chengshang Village in three days, eliminating diseases and epidemics, and ensuring healthy production." Another example is Xiashan Brigade of Maquan Commune, where grain production increased by 29% last year, and Xindian Brigade, where production increased by 25%. Both brigades have changed from poor teams to rich teams. The masses used two folk songs to describe the production situation in the past and present:
    In the past: The rice of Lantian Slope, one basket harvested per mu, happy for two people to carry, unhappy for one person to carry.
    Now: Lantian Slope, a granary; five hundred and ninety last year, more than a thousand this year.
    The Whole Party is Mobilized, the Whole People Take Action
    We Will Surely Be Able to Eliminate All Diseases
    The reason why we have been able to achieve unprecedented great victories in eradicating schistosomiasis and the entire campaign to eliminate pests and diseases is mainly because we have the absolute leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. On the basis of the original schistosomiasis prevention organization, the county party committee, commune party committee, and brigade party branch established and improved the leading organizations for schistosomiasis prevention and pest and disease elimination. Each level of organization assigned a secretary to be in charge, and put schistosomiasis prevention and pest and disease elimination on the party's regular agenda and into the production plan for unified deployment and inspection. Through conference reports, small group discussions, physical exhibitions, on-site visits, real people and real events, and personal experiences, political and health knowledge was widely and deeply publicized and educated, and the right-leaning emotions of fatigue and fear of trouble among a few cadres and the masses were continuously overcome, so that all health cadres and the people of the county in the campaign to eliminate pests and diseases had their enthusiasm redoubled and their fighting spirit became stronger and stronger, forming an invincible and inexhaustible force.
    We have learned that the elimination of pests and diseases and schistosomiasis prevention are closely related to daily production, life, work, and study, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole party, mobilize the whole people, create great momentum, and launch a mass movement. In the past few years, we have trained more than 7,000 mass health cadres and activists in the county, and technical skills have been passed on to the masses. At the same time, according to the characteristics of the agricultural season, under the principle of overall planning and unified arrangement, we have seized the opportunity and focused on key points, and have carried out many large-scale shock movements every year. Moreover, each shock determined a central content, making the movement form a climax again and again. For example, in September 1958, focusing on the elimination of hookworm disease, we applied the method of combining Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and fully utilized the wisdom of cadres and the masses to make a great technical revolution and a high-efficiency movement. A four-person fecal examination team, one microscope, and one assembly line created a new record of 6,240 salt water flotation fecal examinations in twelve hours, and conducted a general survey of feces for more than 170,000 people in the county in 20 days, and also treated 11,249 hookworm patients, achieving the brilliant result of basically eliminating hookworm disease.
    In order to make the work more and more meticulous and the quality higher and higher, we also adopted the method of building key points at all levels and inserting red flags everywhere to make the movement develop rapidly in depth. The county party committee focused on Dengbu Commune, and each commune also selected a brigade as the key point to take the first step, set an example, gain experience, and promote it in an all-round way. For example, after Yangsa Commune did a good job in piloting in Chengshang Village, it held an on-site meeting on health work in the commune here, immediately setting off a competition upsurge of "learning from Chengshang, catching up with Chengshang, and surpassing Chengshang" in the commune, and even the 18 villages that had always been backward, such as Laowei and Xiazai, also opened up the situation and joined the ranks of advanced hygiene. Key areas not only guided the overall situation in terms of work experience, but also cultivated technical forces for the all-round development. For example, in the general survey and treatment of hookworm disease, each commune selected brigade medical staff, midwives, and health workers to concentrate on pilot projects, and then dispersed them back to their brigades. Through these personnel, they adopted the method of learning while doing, and trained a large number of health backbones and mass activists, forming a vast mass technical team. In this way, the movement was improved step by step, and developed in a wider, deeper, more successful, and lasting way.
    We firmly believe that the work of eliminating pests and diseases, like other work, as long as we honestly and forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, listen to the Party, and follow the mass line, we will surely be able to achieve the great victory of eliminating all diseases.

    “瘟神”送走福星到
    江西省余江县代表　杨龙祥
    余江县在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，在消灭血吸虫病及其它寄生虫病方面作出了显著的成绩。
    余江县位于江西省东部，面积一千零二十一平方公里，南北多山，中部平原，白塔河横贯余江县，两岸山青水秀，土地肥沃。但就在这个富饶美丽的地区却流行着血吸虫病。传染血吸虫病的钉螺分布达七十八万二千余平方米，有三万五千一百多人受到血吸虫病的严重威胁，患者达四千三百多人，占疫区人口12．5％。
    过去由于国民党反动派的长期血腥统治和剥削，对人民疾苦熟视无睹，以致血吸虫病蔓延为害一年胜过一年。几十年来罹此病断送生命的不下三千余人，死亡率增加，生育率逐年降低，许多村庄因此而毁灭。如五百余户的建头村，只剩下十五户人家。得了血吸虫病的人，轻则面黄肌瘦，劳动力减弱；重则腹大如鼓，骨瘦如柴，丧失劳动力，荒芜了许多肥沃的良田。人民对当时情景的描绘是：“一把锄头二斤铁，拿到手里就想歇”；“下田扶根棍，不到田头就想困”；“兰田坂，大平原，草长比人高，野兽到处窜。”加上反动政府的苛捐杂税，和封建地主的残酷剥削，农民贫病交迫，生活苦不堪言。这里流行着形容当时悲惨生活的歌谣：家无粮米，人无衣穿，疫神不走，命终难逃。
    挖掉病根　送走瘟神　人寿年丰
    解放后，我们在中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组和中共江西省委直接领导下，为了铲除病根，挖掉穷根，在大力恢复发展生产的同时，建立了血防站，坚决贯彻执行了积极防治的方针，采取了综合性的防治措施，组织发动广大群众，展开了规模壮阔、声势浩大的血吸虫病防治工作。1956年春，随着合作化高潮和农业发展纲要四十条的公布，中共余江县委提出了“半年准备，一年战斗，半年扫尾”，要在两年内根除血吸虫病的宏伟规划。县委第一书记亲自督战，广大人民踊跃参加战斗，参加突击灭螺的群众，最多时达二万余人，经过两年的苦战，开新沟填旧沟共达三百九十七华里，填了部分水塘，开挖了一些新塘。填了的旧沟旧塘灭螺后，都变成良田，共有一千五百多亩；开挖的新沟新塘构成了一个水利灌溉系统，把白塔河水引进新修的渠道灌溉时常受旱的田园，给生产提供了可靠的保证。同时，每个患者都得到了治疗，恢复了健康，大部分都是生产上的主力，劳动效率由过去每个劳动力经营二亩多田提高到十亩以上。
    随着血吸虫病的大力根治和人民健康状况的改善，疫区面貌起了根本的变化。过去人烟稀少，田园荒芜的地区，现在是人寿年丰，到处可以听到幸福的歌唱。多年无生育的妇女，现在生了娃娃；打了几十年单身的人，现在建立了幸福的家庭；过去将要毁灭的村庄，现在是烟雾袅袅，繁荣兴旺；过去是缺粮区，现在变成余粮区。如弓塘大队过去是血吸虫病严重流行地区，劳动力少，人体弱，每年借助亲友的帮忙或雇一点短工，才勉强应付一种一收；到1957年劳动力不但不缺，而且剩下了七千多劳动日搞副业生产活动，粮食产量1957年比1956年增加23．8％，由缺粮大队变成为余粮大队。过去“拿起锄头就想歇”的人，现在成为生龙活虎的生力军，生产大跃进，浑身都是劲，一天干到晚，越干越有劲。整个疫区出现了从未有过的五谷丰登、人畜兴旺的欣欣向荣的景象。人民群众从心眼里歌唱：
    党的领导真正好，处处为民立功劳；
    挖掉穷根挖病根，“瘟神”送走福星到。
    1958年5月，多少年来流行在我县的血吸虫病得到了根除，送走了这个“瘟神”，实现了人民梦寐以求的宿愿，夺取了全国根除血吸虫病的第一面胜利红旗。这个胜利的取得应当首先归功于党中央和毛主席的领导。是党中央和毛主席号召我们消灭血吸虫病，组织和动员我们疫区的人民起来和血吸虫病作顽强的斗争；而在我县取得了根除血吸虫病的巨大成就，创造了一切资本主义国家所梦想不到的奇迹以后，毛主席又写下了光辉的诗篇，赞颂在解放以前曾经是“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疎鬼唱歌”的地方，如今成了“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”的人间乐园。毛主席的这种关怀，对余江县全党全民是极大的振奋和鼓舞。现在，我县人民在取得根除血吸虫病伟大胜利的基础上，又以不断革命的精神，乘风扬帆，破浪疾驰，在全县范围内开展了声势浩大、轰轰烈烈地以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的群众性的爱国卫生运动，进一步巩固血防工作的成果，改善疫区环境卫生面貌，与钩虫病，丝虫病等危害人民身体健康的疾病展开了全面战斗。
    根据反复摸底调查，全县有钩虫病患者一万一千四百二十九人，有丝虫病患者三千六百二十人，有虐疾病患者四千七百三十三人，有性病患者四百五十七人，严重危害人民健康，影响生产的发展。如马荃公社霞山大队丝虫病患者占人口总数60％，患者下肢粗大，行走困难，每月约有七天到十天不能下田生产。余江县委在江西省委的领导下，一面责成卫生工作人员做好调查摸底和宣传教育工作，一面举办训练班，培养新的卫生骨干，把防治钩虫病等疾病有关技术交给群众。旋即在全县范围内大搞厕所、猪栏、牛栏三搬家和室外“三不留”（不留垃圾、污泥、积水），室内“六面光”，彻底改变了城乡环境卫生面貌，全面摧毁了害虫的孳生场所，还扑灭了大批的蚊、蝇、老鼠、臭虫和蟑螂等各种害虫，人人讲卫生的良好习惯已蔚然成风：做到了不随地吐痰、不随地大小便，村村建立了果壳箱和垃圾集中点，一人一条手巾和一把牙刷。与此同时，建立起农村医疗保健网，公社有医院，生产大队有卫生所，生产队有三员：即接生员、保健员、环境卫生员。结合生产，结合生活，采取综合防治措施，把防治疾病的技术交给群众，全面向钩虫病等疾病开展猛攻。截至目前，钩虫病、丝虫病、虐疾、性病在全县范围内已经基本消灭，有力地保护了人民群众的健康，促进了生产的发展，如我县杨溪公社城上村，自消灭了钩虫病等疾病和由“肮脏村”变成“卫生村”之后，劳动出勤率大大提高，去年粮食增产56％，群众歌颂道：“东方红、旭日升，党的号召振人心，男女老幼齐上阵，三天改变城上村，病魔疫疠消灭净，健康生产有保证”。又如马荃公社霞山大队去年粮食增产29％，新店大队增产25％，这两个大队都由穷队变成了富队，群众用两首民歌描述今昔生产情况是：
    过去：兰田坂的禾，亩田割一箩，高兴两人抬，不高兴一人驮。
    现在：兰田坂，粮食屯；去年五百九，今年一千多。全党动员　全民动手
    一定能消灭一切病害
    我们在根除血吸虫病和整个除害灭病斗争中所以能取得史无前例的巨大胜利，主要是由于有了党的绝对领导，坚持了政治挂帅。县委、公社党委和大队党支部在原来血防组织机构的基础上，建立与健全了血防和除害灭病的领导机构，各级组织都指定了一名书记专管，并把血防和除害灭病工作列入党的经常议事日程，列入生产规划之中，统一部署和检查。通过大会报告，小会讨论，实物展览，现场参观，真人实事，现身说法等方法，广泛深入地进行了政治和卫生知识的宣传教育，不断地克服了少数干部和群众中的厌倦和怕麻烦等右倾情绪，使全体卫生干部和全县人民在除害灭病斗争中的干劲一鼓再鼓，斗志愈战愈强，形成了一支攻无不克、战无不胜的无穷无尽的力量。
    我们体会到除害灭病和血防工作是关系到日常生产、生活、工作和学习的切身问题，因此必须做到全党动员，全民动手，大造声势，大搞群众运动。几年来我们在全县培训了七千余名群众性的卫生干部和积极分子，技术交给了群众，同时根据农事季节特点，在全面规划与统一安排的原则下，抓住时机，突击重点，每年都开展了多次的大规模的突击运动。而且每次突击都确定一个中心内容，使运动一次又一次地形成高潮。如在1958年9月以消灭钩虫病为中心，应用中西结合，土洋并举的办法，充分发挥干部和群众的智慧，大闹技术革命，大搞高工效运动，一个四人检粪小组，一镜（显微镜）一条龙，在十二小时内创造盐水漂浮检粪六千二百四十份的新纪录，在二十天内为全县十七万余人民进行了粪便的普查，还治疗了一万一千二百四十九个钩虫病人，达到了基本消灭钩虫病的辉煌战果。
    为了使工作愈做愈细致，质量越来越高，我们还采取了层层建重点，处处插红旗的办法，使运动迅速向纵深发展。县委以邓埠公社为重点，各公社也选择一个大队为重点，先走一步，做出榜样，取得经验，全面推广。如杨洒公社在城上村搞好试点后，在这里召开全社卫生工作现场会，立即在公社掀起了“学城上，赶城上，超城上”的竞赛热潮，连一向落后的老危、夏梓等十八个村子也打开了局面，加入了卫生先进的行列。重点地区不仅在工作经验上指导了全面，而且为全面铺开培养了技术力量，例如在钩虫病等的普查普治中，各公社抽调了大队医务人员、接生员、卫生员集中进行试点，然后再分散回本大队通过这批人员采取边做边学的方式，又培训了大批的卫生骨干和群众积极分子，形成一支广大群众性的技术队伍。这样，就使运动步步提高，得到更广泛、更深入、更有成就地持久地开展。
    我们深信：除害灭病工作和其他工作一样，只要老老实实永远遵照毛主席的教导去做，听党的话，走群众路线，我们就一定能够取得消灭一切病害的伟大胜利。
