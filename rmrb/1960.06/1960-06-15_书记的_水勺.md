The water ladle that Secretary Fang Zixing uses to water flowers might seem mysterious to some. It has neither a handle nor a grip, and its edges slant outwards all around. This morning, he was again using the ladle to water the flowers. I secretly approached him, wanting to take a good look. Before I could ask, the Secretary had already guessed my question. He held the ladle in front of me, a smile on his face. "Young man, this is no ordinary water ladle. If you ask about its age, it's probably older than you. Its hometown is far across the Eastern Seas, originally created by the hands of fellow workers."

"Unexpectedly, its master was a bandit who stretched his devil claws towards our motherland. Burning, raping, looting, owing countless debts of blood, it was the steel helmet worn by the bandit."

"Before the Battle of Pingxingguan, the People's Army first reported victory, killing the Japanese devils so that their men and horses fled howling like wolves and dogs. It bid farewell to its bandit master and became a treasure for me to kill the enemy."

"For more than twenty years, it has helped me perform no small feats: on the Huaihai battlefield, it blocked falling stray bullets; in the tunnels of Shangganling, it melted hard ice and snow; beside the sentry post on Hainan Island, it planted fiery red peonies…"

"When I demobilized, I couldn't bear to throw it away, touching it over and over again, looking at it time after time. The leader truly understood my feelings. He said, 'Why don't you just take it with you?'" Speaking here, he became indignant and impassioned, the flames of hatred burning in his eyes. His huge fist clenched tightly, and his loud voice rose high: "The number one enemy of the world's people, the American imperialists, are again stirring up trouble and trying to engage in aggression. What 'Japan-U.S. New Security Treaty,' who doesn't know the bandits' evil intentions!"

"Warn the bandits, the Chinese people have already stood up! The incomparably powerful Soviet Union is closely allied with us. If the U.S.-Japan reactionaries insist on going against the tide of history, let them take a good look at my water ladle!" (Attached picture)

    书记的“水勺”
    方孜行书记浇花用的那个水勺，说起来也许会有人感到奥妙，既没有提手更没有把柄，四周的边儿斜着往外翘。这天清晨他又捧着勺儿把花浇，我偷偷靠近他身旁想好好瞧瞧，没容我提出问题书记早已猜着，勺儿端到我面前脸上露着微笑：“小伙子，这可不是普通的水勺，要问它的年岁恐怕比你还高。它的故乡远隔着东洋大海，本也是工人弟兄双手创造。“没想到它的主人是强盗，竟向我们祖国伸来魔爪。烧、淫、掳、掠欠下血债累累，它是强盗头戴的钢帽。“平型关前人民军队首传捷报，杀得鬼子人马飞天狼嗥狗叫。它永别了强盗主人，成为我杀敌的一宝。“二十多年来它帮我立功不小：淮海战场挡住过流弹的下掉，上甘岭坑道里化过坚硬的冰雪，海南岛哨棚旁栽过火红的芍药……“复员时我舍不得把它扔掉，一遍一遍摸来一次一次瞧。首长真看透了我的心情，他说：要不你就把它带走。”说到这里他变得愤慨激昂，眼眶里仇恨的火焰在燃烧。巨大的拳头握得紧紧，响亮的嗓门提得高高：“世界人民的头号敌人美国佬，又在兴风作浪想搞侵略。什么‘日美新安全条约’，强盗的鬼胎谁不知道！“警告强盗，中国人民早已站起来了！强大无比的苏联和我们紧紧相靠。美日反动派定要倒行逆施，叫它们好好瞧瞧我的水勺！”（附图片）
