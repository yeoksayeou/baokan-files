Xinhua News Agency, Yangon. Renowned economist U Ba Yin pointed out in a commentary published in Yangon newspapers on the 10th that the recent agreement between the U.S. and Indian governments for the U.S. to sell 17 million tons of "surplus" agricultural products to India will not only fail to solve India's food shortage problem, but may even cause significant losses to India.

The commentary stated that this agreement will make India more dependent on the United States in the future.

The commentary pointed out that the United States will certainly take full advantage of this opportunity to interfere in India's political and economic affairs.

The commentary noted that the U.S.'s so-called "aid" and "gifts" are carried out under principles that are beneficial to it. The commentary cited a report from an American weekly published on May 16 stating that the U.S. can save $500 million annually in storage and management fees by dumping "surplus" agricultural products in India.

The commentary emphasized that "It is a bad thing for the United States to openly engage in political interference under the name of 'aid.' This practice will undermine India's neutral policy and will also be harmful to Burma and other Asian and African countries."

The commentary stated that the U.S.-India food agreement is a direct blow to Burma. Burma relies on rice exports to earn foreign exchange. Burma exports one to two million tons of rice annually to enable itself to trade with foreign countries. India has always been Burma's largest customer for rice. If India stops buying Burmese rice, Burma's rice exports will decrease, which will cause Burma to encounter economic difficulties.

    缅经济学家评美印粮食协定
    印度将更加依赖美国
    美国倾销大米严重打击缅甸经济
    新华社仰光电　著名经济学家吴巴迎10日在仰光各报发表的一篇评论中指出，美印两国政府最近签订的美国向印度出售一千七百万吨“剩余”农产品的协定不仅不会解决印度的缺粮问题，而且甚至会给印度造成很大的损失。
    评论说，这项协定将使印度在将来更加依赖美国。
    评论指出，美国当然会充分利用这个机会来干涉印度的政治和经济事务。
    评论指出，美国的所谓“援助”和“赠送”是在对它有利的原则下进行的。评论援引5月16日出版的一家美国周刊的消息说，美国通过在印度倾销“剩余”农产品，每年可以节省五亿美元的储藏保管费。
    评论强调说，“美国在‘援助’的名义下公开进行政治干涉是件坏事。这种作法将使印度的中立政策受到破坏，对缅甸和其他亚非国家也将是有害的。”
    评论说，美印粮食协定是直接对缅甸的打击。缅甸需要靠大米出口来获得外汇。缅甸每年出口一、二百万吨大米以便使自己有能力同外国进行贸易。印度一直是缅甸大米的最大主顾，如果印度将停止购买缅甸的大米，缅甸大米的输出量就会减少，从而将使缅甸遇到经济困难。
