Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said at the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education held on the 3rd that our country now has a politically strong and modernly equipped army and a powerful militia force, and our national defense strength has been greatly strengthened. However, imperialism still exists in the world today, and US imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan. We are still suffering from the serious threat of imperialist wars of aggression. Only by resolutely struggling against imperialism and fully preparing for anti-aggression wars can we eliminate counter-revolutionary wars with revolutionary wars when imperialism launches a war. Completely eradicate the root cause of modern warfare—the imperialist system.

In his speech, General Xiao Hua first exposed the various war preparations and war conspiracies of US imperialism. He said that recently, the incident of the United States sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and brazenly sabotaging the Four-Power Summit once again exposed the aggressive nature of the United States under the guise of peace. This is a resounding alarm bell for those who harbor unrealistic illusions about US imperialism. Countless facts have proven that US imperialism has not only never abandoned its policy of aggression and war, but is also intensifying its preparations for launching wars of aggression in many ways. He said that after the end of the Korean War, the United States' military expenditures have remained at about 60% of the national budget every year. In recent years, the US government has also formulated a new five-year (1959-1963) plan for developing military power centered on the development of long-range missiles,妄想 to catch up with the Soviet Union, reverse the military decline, and step up preparations for launching wars of aggression. The United States is also actively expanding military bases around the world, strengthening its aggressive military blocs, and further strengthening the military encirclement of the socialist camp. The United States is further arming West Germany and Japan, attempting to make these two countries with the most military and aggressive traditions its two henchmen in future wars. The United States' war threats and military provocations against our country are becoming increasingly rampant. From September 7, 1958, to May 25 this year alone, US warships and aircraft have intruded into our territorial waters and airspace 156 times. The United States also constantly holds large-scale military exercises in the Far East. In the past sixteen months alone, there have been thirty-eight such exercises, including fourteen military exercises conducted in the Taiwan area and the Taiwan Strait, and it has publicly announced that these exercises are aimed at China. These circumstances fully demonstrate that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. As long as US imperialism is not overthrown for a day, the danger of war will not be eliminated for a day.

General Xiao Hua said that of course, the strength of the socialist camp is now in a dominant position. The United States is not only unprecedentedly isolated politically, but also far behind in cutting-edge science and technology. They can no longer launch wars as unscrupulously as in the past. However, we are not the chief of staff of imperialism after all, and we do not decide whether to fight or not. Moreover, it must also be estimated that the ruling groups of imperialism, based on class hatred and class interests, may go all out and make a desperate struggle even in the absence of any hope of victory. Therefore, on the one hand, we must constantly expose the war conspiracies of imperialism, try our best to postpone the outbreak of war, and strive for genuine world peace; on the other hand, we must always be vigilant, work hard to strengthen national defense, and make all preparations to cope with sudden incidents. If imperialism insists on fighting, our certainty of victory will be even greater. The views that the danger of war has disappeared due to the emergence of nuclear weapons, the socialist forces have surpassed the imperialist forces, the aggressive nature of imperialism has changed, the possibility of imperialism launching a large-scale war against the socialist camp no longer exists, etc., are not in line with the facts and violate Marxism-Leninism. If we lose vigilance and relax our preparations because of this, it would be even more wrong.

General Xiao Hua said that we are Marxists, and we are advocates of the elimination of war. Our ambition is to free mankind from the scourge of war forever. However, we know that war is an inevitable product of class society and the system of exploitation, and the root cause of modern war is the imperialist system. As long as imperialism exists, war is inevitable. Only by people's revolutionary war can we eliminate imperialism's counter-revolutionary war. To eliminate war and achieve lasting peace for mankind, we must eliminate the root cause of war.

General Xiao Hua said that in order to prepare for dealing with imperialist aggression, we must not only build a modern revolutionary army, but also build a strong militia force. Combining the building of a modern revolutionary army with the large-scale development of militia divisions is the concrete application of the "walking on two legs" policy in national defense construction and a major development of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war under modern conditions. The large-scale development of militia divisions is a fundamental measure for us to defend against imperialist aggression and defend socialist construction. The militia can not only assist the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland's land, sea and air defenses in peacetime, but also has an extremely important strategic position in modern warfare. The large-scale development of militia divisions not only strengthens national defense, but also greatly promotes economic construction. The central task of the militia during the period of peaceful construction is to go all out and carry out production and construction. Over the past two years, the militia has become a shock force and main force on all fronts of production and construction.

General Xiao Hua said that the great development of our country's economy and cultural undertakings is a necessary prerequisite and fundamental guarantee for the realization of national defense modernization. National defense strength is the comprehensive manifestation of the country's political strength, economic strength, and scientific and technological strength. In leading our country's successive revolutionary wars and in many instructions since the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized the importance of developing economic construction for winning the war and strengthening national defense. We must see that economic construction is the foundation of national defense construction, and the strengthening of national defense must be based on economic development. We must also see that national defense construction is a necessary condition for guaranteeing our country's economic construction. Our task is to both concentrate our efforts to build socialism as quickly as possible, and to continuously strengthen national defense on the basis of economic development to defend socialist construction. Practice over the past few years has fully proved that doing so is conducive to both national economic and cultural construction and enhances national defense. This is a completely correct path to enriching the country and strengthening the army.

General Xiao Hua finally said: To rapidly build our motherland into a great, prosperous and strong socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense is our common goal. We must not only achieve this goal, but we will certainly be able to achieve it! Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, strive forward to build and defend our great motherland and to defend world peace!

### 不断加强国防力量保卫祖国建设  萧华上将在全国文教群英会上讲话

    不断加强国防力量保卫祖国建设
    萧华上将在全国文教群英会上讲话
    新华社3日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将在3日举行的全国文教先进工作者代表大会上说，我国现在已经拥有一支政治坚强的、装备现代化的军队和一支强大的民兵队伍，我们的国防力量已经大大加强了。但是，今天世界上还有帝国主义存在，美帝国主义还霸占我国的领土台湾，我们还遭受着帝国主义侵略战争的严重威胁。我们只有坚决同帝国主义斗争，充分作好反侵略战争的准备，才能在帝国主义一旦发动战争的时候，用革命战争消灭反革命战争。彻底铲除现代战争的根源——帝国主义制度。
    萧华上将在讲话中首先揭露了美帝国主义的各种备战活动和战争阴谋。他说，最近，美国派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，悍然破坏四国首脑会议的事件，又一次暴露了美国在和平幌子下的侵略本性。这对于那些对美帝国主义抱有不切实际的幻想的人，是一次响亮的警钟。无数事实证明，美帝国主义不但从来没有放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策，而且正在从多方面加紧进行发动侵略战争的准备。他说，美国在朝鲜战争结束以后，每年的军事费用，仍然保持在国家预算的60％左右。近年来，美国政府又制订了以发展远程导弹为中心的、新的发展军事力量的五年（1959年—1963年）计划，妄想赶上苏联，挽回军事颓势，加紧进行发动侵略战争的准备。美国还在世界各地积极扩大军事基地，强化它的侵略性军事集团，进一步加强对社会主义阵营的军事包围。美国正在进一步武装西德和日本，企图使这两个最具有军事侵略传统的国家，成为它在未来战争中的两个打手。美国对我国进行战争威胁和军事挑衅，更是越来越猖狂。仅从1958年9月7日到今年5月25日，美国军舰和飞机侵入我国领海领空的事件就有一百五十六次。美国在远东地区还不断举行大规模的军事演习，仅在过去十六个月中，这种演习就有三十八次，其中在台湾地区和台湾海峡进行的军事演习有十四次，而且公然宣布这些演习是针对中国的。这些情况充分说明，美帝国主义是中国人民和世界人民最凶恶的敌人。只要美帝国主义一天不被打倒，战争的危险，就一天不会消除。
    萧华上将说，当然，现在社会主义阵营的力量已经处于优势。美国不但在政治上空前孤立，而且在尖端科学技术上也已远远落在后面。它们已经不能像过去那样毫无顾忌地发动战争了。但是，我们终究不是帝国主义的参谋长，打不打不由我们决定。而且还要估计到，帝国主义的统治集团，他们基于阶级仇恨和阶级利益，即使在毫无胜利希望的情况下，也可能孤注一掷，进行垂死挣扎。因此，我们一方面要不断揭露帝国主义的战争阴谋，尽力推迟战争的爆发，争取真正的世界和平；另一方面又要随时提高警惕，努力加强国防力量，作好应付突然事变的一切准备。如果帝国主义硬是要打，我们取得胜利的把握也就会更大。那种认为由于核武器的出现，由于社会主义力量已经超过了帝国主义力量，战争的危险已经消失了，帝国主义的侵略本性已经改变了，帝国主义向社会主义阵营发动大规模战争的可能性已经不存在了，等等看法，是不符合事实的，是违背马克思列宁主义的。如果因此而丧失警惕，放松准备，那就更是错误。
    萧华上将说，我们是马克思主义者，我们是战争消灭论者。我们的雄心壮志，就是要使人类永远摆脱战争的灾难。但是，我们知道，战争是阶级社会和剥削制度的必然产物，现代战争的根源就是帝国主义制度。只要帝国主义存在，战争就是不可避免的。只有用人民革命战争，才能消灭帝国主义的反革命战争。要想消灭战争，实现人类的永久和平，就必须消灭产生战争的根源。
    萧华上将说，为了准备对付帝国主义的侵略，不仅要建设一支现代化的革命军队，而且要建设一支强大的民兵队伍。把建设现代化革命军队和大办民兵师结合起来，这是“两条腿走路”的方针在国防建设上的具体运用，是毛泽东同志人民战争思想在现代条件下的重大发展。大办民兵师，这是我们防御帝国主义侵略、保卫社会主义建设的根本措施。民兵不但在平时可以协助人民解放军保卫祖国的陆海空防，而且在现代战争中具有极为重要的战略地位。大办民兵师，不但加强了国防力量，而且大大促进了经济建设。民兵在和平建设时期的中心任务，就是鼓足革命干劲，进行生产建设。两年来，民兵已经成为各个生产建设战线上的突击队和主力军。
    萧华上将说，我们国家的经济和文化事业的大发展，是实现国防现代化的必要前提和根本保证。国防力量就是国家政治力量、经济力量、科学技术力量的综合表现。毛泽东同志在领导我国历次革命战争中，在建国以来的许多指示中，都一再强调了发展经济建设对于争取战争胜利，对于加强国防力量的重要意义。我们要看到经济建设是国防建设的基础，国防的加强必须以经济的发展为前提。也要看到国防建设又是保障我国经济建设的必要条件。我们的任务是既要集中力量尽快地建设社会主义，又要在经济发展的基础上不断加强国防力量，来保卫社会主义建设。几年来的实践完全证明，这样做的结果，既有利于国家经济、文化建设，又增强了国防力量。这是一条完全正确的富国强兵的道路。
    萧华上将最后说：把我们的祖国迅速建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大的富强的社会主义国家，这是我们大家的共同奋斗目标。我们不但一定要实现这个目标，而且也一定能够达到这个目标！让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，为建设和保卫我们伟大的祖国，为保卫全世界的和平，奋勇前进！
