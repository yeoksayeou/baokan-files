Killing Many Birds with One Stone
　　Xu Hao

　　The story of killing two birds with one stone was once passed down as a beautiful tale for ages; nowadays, killing many birds with one stone is already a common occurrence.

　　The employees of the Wuchang Hongguang Paint and Oil Refinery, through diligent study and ingenious efforts, starting from scratch and using indigenous methods to vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization and repeated utilization, achieved great results by utilizing the by-product mixed asphalt from the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's coking plant in multiple ways. People say this approach is "killing five birds with one stone." Which five birds did this arrow hit? First, it achieved multiple uses for one material, extracting forty-six new products from the mixed asphalt; second, it promoted the development of production, increasing the number of products from six to sixty-four, and the daily output value from three thousand yuan to sixty thousand yuan; third, it promoted the in-depth development of the technological revolution; fourth, it promoted the rapid improvement of scientific and technological levels; fifth, it improved the ideological level of leading cadres and employees, clarifying that comprehensive utilization is an important method for developing industry at high speed. The benefits brought by these five big birds are truly extraordinary, from developing production to improving ideology, it can be said that everything is a bumper harvest.

　　Comprehensive utilization has so many benefits, and it truly is killing five birds with one stone, which cannot help but make people applaud and praise "Good arrow! Good arrow!". In fact, this good arrow is not in the comprehensive utilization itself, but in the people’s liberation of thought, breaking down superstitions, and having the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, with a high sense of responsibility for creating more wealth for society and a spirit of continuous revolution. With this spirit, we can discover treasures from so-called "waste," obtain treasures, turn useless into useful, and turn single use into multiple uses.

　　Truly possessing the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and mastering the ideological weapon of continuous revolution, with bow and arrow in hand, it is not just possible to hit five birds! But also to kill many birds with one stone, achieving multiple gains with one move, and achieving greater and more significant results in work and production.

    一箭多雕
    徐浩
    一箭双雕的故事，曾经传为千古美谈；如今，一箭多雕，已经是司空见惯的事情了。
    武昌虹光制漆炼油厂的职工苦学巧钻，白手起家，用土办法大搞综合利用和反复制用，多方面利用武钢焦化厂的副产品混合沥青，获得了巨大效果，人们说这种作法是“一箭五雕”。他们这一箭射中的是哪五雕呢？一是做到了一物多用，从混合沥青中提炼出了四十六种新产品；二是促进了生产的发展，产品由六种增加到六十四种，日产值由三千元升到六万元；三是促进了技术革命的深入开展；四是推动了科学技术水平的迅速提高；五是提高了领导干部和职工的思想水平，明确了综合利用是高速度发展工业的一个重要方法。这五只大雕带来的好处真是非同小可，从发展生产到提高思想，可以说是样样丰收。
    大搞综合利用有如此多的好处，而且果然是一箭五雕，这不能不使人拍手赞扬“好箭！好箭！”。其实这支好箭不在综合利用本身，而在于人们解放思想破除迷信，有了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，有了为社会创造更多财富的高度责任感和不断革命的精神。有了这种精神，才能从所谓“废物”中发现珍宝、取得珍宝，变无用为有用，变一用为多用。
    真正具备了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，掌握了不断革命的思想武器，弓箭在手，何止是能够射中五雕！而且能够一箭多雕，一举多得，使工作、生产获得更多更大的效果。
