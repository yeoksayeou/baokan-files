    Continuously Carry Out Cultural Learning Movement
    Representative of a certain army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Guo Chao
    In January 1959, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued instructions on popularizing intermediate and higher education among cadres, clearly proposing to popularize intermediate and higher education among all army cadres over a ten-year period starting from 1959. Since then, our army's cultural education has entered a new stage of development.
    This grand "ten-year plan" accurately reflected the actual needs of our army's construction and the urgent demands of the vast number of cadres. After it was spread in our unit, it was immediately warmly supported by the vast number of cadres, and quickly set off a large-scale learning upsurge. The number of participants reached 97.5%. Even cadres who were often out on duty, as well as section and regimental-level leading cadres who were very busy with work, almost all participated in the study. Amateur primary schools, middle schools, and universities sprang up like mushrooms after rain. Wherever there were troops, there were learning organizations; wherever the cadres went, they studied. The vast number of cadres got up early and went to bed late, competing for every minute and second, and rarely rested on holidays; books were always with them, taking advantage of every spare moment to study; whether on duty, on leave, or serving as soldiers, learning was never interrupted; waiting for trains, riding trains, taking ships, and staying in hotels all became good opportunities for learning. Everyone's slogan was: "Carry books with you at all times, seize time while waiting for trains and ships, squeeze out a little time every day, and compete to be the top scholar after ten years." This learning movement has become a magnificent and persistent mass movement.
    Over the past year, cultural learning has begun to achieve great results. Individuals generally spend 500 to 600 hours studying throughout the year. Cadres participating in middle school courses, in addition to completing more than one-third of the middle school Chinese language, have also completed two or three mathematics courses (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry). The annual exam pass rate reached 97.2%, with an overall average of 85.1 points. After a year of study, the cultural level of cadres has been significantly improved, and it has had a huge impact on all aspects of work, study, and thinking. First of all, it has created conditions for cadres to learn military science, master military technology, and improve the ability to train troops. In the past, cadres often relied on rote memorization for some formulas in military technology due to a lack of mathematical knowledge. Now that their mathematical knowledge has increased, they not only understand quickly but also remember firmly. Through Chinese language learning, the cadres' reading and writing skills have been further improved, especially for studying Chairman Mao's works, which has been of great help and promotion. In 1959, the number of articles published in various newspapers and periodicals by our unit increased by 40% compared to 1958. Most of the political cadres above the regimental level have written better work reports. According to statistics from a certain division, cadres throughout the division have purchased more than 21,000 political books this year. Many cadres also feel that their "minds have been greatly opened" due to the improvement of their cultural level, and their confidence in their work has greatly increased. Some cadres use "three worries turned into three joys" to summarize their cultural learning gains over the past year, saying that in the past, they were: "First worry, it is difficult to prepare lessons and teach well; second worry, unable to write even with experience; third worry, unable to conquer military science"; now they are: "First joy, the mind is quick and the hands are skillful; second joy, the pen runs smoothly; third joy, cultural and military skills are improved."
    Over the past year, the main experience of cadre cultural education has been to adhere to putting politics in command and launching a large-scale mass movement. Specifically, we have the following six aspects of experience.
    Continuously Encourage Enthusiasm, Oppose Rightism, and Break Conservatism
    After the General Political Department announced the grand plan for popularizing intermediate and higher education, the vast number of cadres warmly supported it and were overjoyed. However, some people lacked great ambitions, thinking that "it is enough to learn some Chinese and arithmetic, why learn so much?" More people lacked confidence, saying: "How can a roughneck become a college student?" "We are so busy with work, where is the time to learn culture? If we want to learn, we have to go to school?" "The army doesn't have university professors, how can we engage in higher education?" To sum up, there are three questions, namely: "Is it necessary to learn?" "Can we learn while on the job?" "Who should we mainly rely on for learning?" Accordingly, we launched a vigorous cultural education propaganda movement in the spring of 1959. First, we clarified our understanding among the party committees and leading cadres at all levels. Unify language, and then mobilize level by level from top to bottom; everyone speaks, and everyone promotes. We focused on clarifying the great significance of cultural education, explaining that military cultural education is an integral part of the national cultural revolution, and military cadres should actively respond to the great call of the Party's cultural revolution. It was explained that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always cared about the cultural education of the troops, and that earnestly carrying out cultural education work is a glorious tradition of our army. In particular, it was explained that cultural knowledge is the key to opening the treasure house of modern military science and political theory, and in order to strengthen the revolutionization and accelerate the modernization of our army, it is necessary to improve the level of cultural and scientific knowledge. It was explained that popularizing intermediate and higher education is one of the urgent and major tasks to improve the quality of our army's cadres and strengthen our army's construction. At the same time, we also vigorously promoted learning models in various aspects. Through such a free discussion and propaganda education, the cadres recognized the situation, enhanced their confidence, broke their sense of inferiority, criticized skepticism, overcame various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking, and clarified confused ideas, and an unprecedented learning upsurge was formed.
    However, ideological work is not a one-time effort. It is not difficult to do cultural learning in one go, but it is not easy to persevere. Therefore, ideological work must be gradually deepened with the development of the movement and continuously implemented throughout the process. It can be said that the process of popularizing intermediate and higher education is also a process of continuous ideological mobilization and ideological struggle. We used the thought of continuous revolution to guide the development of the movement, and through three on-site meetings, four larger debate meetings, and the use of many good and bad examples for vivid comparison, we put forward clear goals of effort at each stage, as well as the continuous ideological work of party committees at all levels, which enabled the cadres' understanding to gradually improve and constantly move forward, making the mass learning movement continuous and persistent, and finally winning high-speed, high-quality, and large-area harvest.
    Adapt to the characteristics of on-the-job cadres in the troops and adopt flexible and diverse forms of schooling
    Our troops are guarding the border of the motherland, performing various tasks such as training, construction, and participating in socialist construction; some of the garrisons are relatively concentrated, and some are relatively scattered; the professional categories of the vast number of cadres are diverse; the cultural level is uneven, and the requirements are different; and because of meetings, training, serving as soldiers, traveling on business, and participating in local work, cadres are often away from their posts and have high mobility. On-the-job cadres must also focus on their work; in terms of learning, military, political, professional, and cultural learning tasks are very heavy. This requires that in teaching, in addition to resolutely implementing the General Political Department's instructions to focus on on-the-job amateur self-study, the organizational form should be flexible and diverse yet strict. It is necessary to adapt to the time, place, and people in order to persist in learning in various situations. Various units have many creations in the flexible use of teaching organizational forms. For example, a certain artillery regiment, in the complicated and difficult situation of field training, still adopted various forms and stubbornly persisted in cultural learning. Such as sprinting before departure, "digesting" on the way; assigning learning tasks to the party branch for contracting, organizing learning in company units, and the regiment and camp jointly organizing several reporting groups, squatting points and mobile teaching, etc. During the 26-day field training, not only did they achieve good results in the overall tactical shooting evaluation; at the same time, the cadres studied an average of about 60 hours of culture, and in addition to learning one to two chapters of new lessons, each person also did an average of 67 review questions of old lessons. The various units have also made proper arrangements for the learning of cadres who are out on duty: such as "guarding the entrance and exit", all individual departures are given learning tasks, sprinting before departure, consolidating while away; several people are formed into study groups, and batches of departures are followed by teachers to form "temporary middle schools", etc. After returning to the team, they must check the "acceptance", and any missing must be supplemented. With flexible teaching methods, learning can be both widely carried out and sustained for a long time.
    Through more than a year of practice, we have found a set of practical methods for carrying out on-the-job cadre learning, that is: focusing on on-the-job learning, supplemented by short-term training; unified leadership, decentralized management, rooted in the company (branch), planned implementation; long-term plans, short-term arrangements; long-term flow, continuous line combined with organizing large and small learning upsurges; running large, medium, and small schools simultaneously; organizing separately according to the cadres' existing cultural level and work situation using various organizational forms; and putting forward different requirements according to different situations. In this way, we can take care of the majority, fully mobilize, implement a broad mass line, and take different approaches to move towards the goal of popularizing intermediate and higher education.
    Vigorously carry out self-study activities, cultivate cadres' self-study habits, and lay the foundation for in-depth and lasting movement
    When the vast number of cadres develop self-study habits, they can persist in learning under various difficult conditions and avoid the phenomenon of three days of fishing and two days of drying nets. Some people say: "Self-study is a treasure, it cannot be scattered by the wind or knocked down by thunder." Self-study is also an extremely important factor in improving teaching quality. Because only by independent thinking, studying enough hours, and completing assignments can one remember firmly, understand deeply, and achieve thorough understanding and proficiency. Self-study is the basis of all learning methods. "If you don't eat yourself, you will never be full." Facts have proved that the development of cadres' self-study habits is invaluable and is the foundation for the in-depth and lasting learning movement.
    For cadres to develop self-study habits, they must go through a process from being insufficiently conscious to being conscious, from lacking perseverance to having perseverance, and from being insufficiently habitual to forming habits. This requires a lot of detailed ideological and organizational work. According to more than a year of experience, first of all, we must do a good job in ideological mobilization, so that cadres can establish lofty ambitions, muster revolutionary enthusiasm, clarify the direction of learning, establish models, and carry out the movement of learning from models and catching up with models. At the same time, we must also do a good job in organizational work such as discussing learning indicators, formulating personal learning plans, organizing mutual assistance, arranging guidance for self-study, and conducting regular inspections and evaluations, so that cadres can gradually develop self-study habits. The specific leadership and supervision of cadres' self-study mainly rely on the party branch to grasp, combining ideological work and organizational measures with daily work and life, and persisting for a long time. Mass teaching and mass learning, the able are teachers, establish and
    Cultivate a strong team of teachers
    Establishing and cultivating a strong team of teachers is an important guarantee for completing the "ten-year plan." However, the number of full-time teachers in the army is very small, and their level is not high. Where do the teachers come from? We resolutely implemented the instructions of the General Political Department and adopted the mass line of "mass teaching and mass learning, the able are teachers" and "full-time teachers as the backbone, part-time teachers as the main body", and quickly built a large team of teachers. By the end of last year, the number of teachers had increased tenfold compared to the beginning of the year, with an average of one teacher for every five students, and two or three teachers in each teaching class. Part-time teachers are four times the number of full-time teachers, including cadres of all levels and categories and many soldiers.
    Can this teach well? Facts have proved that it can teach well. The advantages of part-time teachers are: teaching in their own units, being familiar with students, being familiar with their own industry, being able to teach students according to their aptitude, linking with reality, and integrating learning with application, because they are with the students, they can easily integrate with the students and teach anytime, anywhere. Although their cultural foundation is thinner, they wholeheartedly serve the students, learn a step ahead, prepare lessons carefully, and are good at following the mass line. The vast majority can be competent. According to a survey by a certain division, 80% of those who can teach well and are welcomed by the masses, and 59% of the teachers who have made meritorious service and received awards last year. Although some teachers were not at a high level at first, they have now completed most of the high school courses due to their self-study while teaching. In this way, "the tide rises", and they can also serve as teachers of higher courses in the future. The current teachers and students in the university class are the main force of the teacher team that will popularize higher education in the future.
    Continuously carry out teaching reform, so that education serves the army building, and learning is more, faster, better, and more economical
    The popularization of intermediate and higher education in our army can only serve the army building and serve the proletarian politics. Therefore, cultural education must be consistent with learning and application, and learning while using. Regarding the content of teaching, the General Political Department has carried out reforms when compiling teaching materials, reducing the parts that are not very needed by our army cadres and increasing the content that is urgently needed. In our teaching, on the one hand, we emphasize laying a good foundation and advancing steadily; on the other hand, we learn what is urgently needed in the course arrangement, and closely link the content with reality. In order to solve the problem of linking with reality, we collected a large number of realistic problems to enrich the teaching materials. In terms of teaching, we mobilized teachers and students to compile a large number of application problems based on the actual problems encountered in the work and life of the troops' training, technical innovation, construction, helping the people's labor, and sideline production. And link up to solve the difficult problems encountered by everyone in reading and writing. In this way, the teaching is vivid and practical, and it can be used immediately after learning, the effect is immediate, the students have a strong interest in learning, and it also helps to persist for a long time.
    In teaching, we also combine systematic classroom teaching with mobilizing the masses and carrying out diverse extracurricular teaching activities according to the characteristics of on-the-job cadre learning, and implement walking on two legs. That is, mobilizing cadres to combine work, study, and daily life to carry out large-scale exercises, calculations, reading, writing, intensive reading, and daily practice activities after class. This extracurricular teaching activity not only consolidates and deepens the knowledge learned in textbooks, but also seizes many learning hours, learns many practical new knowledge, and is directly beneficial to work, and also helps to develop self-study habits. Walking on two legs is a learning method that is more, faster, better, and more economical. It is required that teachers go deep into the masses and do everything possible to guide cadres to study.
    Leading cadres go deep into teaching, learning while leading, first as students, then as leaders
    With the continuous development of the work of popularizing intermediate and higher education, it is required that leaders at all levels implement specific, practical, and not general leadership on cultural education. Cultural education is unfamiliar to many leading comrades. In order to change this situation, we first emphasized the view of Chairman Mao's "On Practice",
  "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." It is emphasized that leaders at all levels should go deep into teaching practice, explore the laws, find concrete ways to implement the teaching policy, and strive for high-speed and high-quality, and lead teaching through teaching. At the same time, we also had military and division leaders take the lead on stage to give lectures at an on-site meeting and made demonstrations. Since then, leading comrades at all levels have invested in teaching practice and personally grasped teaching. There are three main ways for our leaders to go deep into teaching: First, attend classes and be good students, and learn from them how to learn and how to teach, and help teachers and students improve teaching and learning methods; second, directly participate in activities such as lesson preparation, lecturing, correcting homework, and summarizing experience, and find ways to improve teaching methods and reform teaching content; third, go deep into one school and one class, "dissect sparrows", conduct solid investigations and research, conduct on-site inspections, provide on-site guidance, correct shortcomings, and summarize and promote advanced experience. Over the past year, more than 100 leading cadres above the battalion level in our troops have taken the stage to give lectures; leading cadres above the regimental level have conducted multiple inspections of cultural education work and wrote 42 relatively systematic investigation materials. These activities have timely discovered and solved the problems in cultural education work, and vigorously promoted the continuous leap forward of cultural education work.

    持续地开展文化学习运动
    中国人民解放军某军代表　郭超
    1959年1月，中国人民解放军总政治部发布了在干部中普及中，高等教育的指示，明确提出了从1959年起，以十年为期，在全军干部中普及中、高等教育。从此，我军文化教育进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    这个宏伟的“十年大计”，正确地反映了我军建设的实际需要和广大干部的迫切要求，它在我们这支部队中传开之后，立即得到广大干部的热烈拥护，迅速掀起了一个声势浩大的学习高潮。参加学习的人数达到97．5％，连经常外出的干部，以及工作十分繁忙的科、团级领导干部，也几乎全部参加了学习。业余小学、中学、大学，如雨后春笋般地建立起来。哪里有部队，哪里就有学习组织；干部走到哪里，就学到哪里。广大干部早起晚睡、分秒必争，节假日也很少休息；书不离身，见缝插针，利用一切空隙时间学习；不论外出、执勤、探家、当兵，学习都不中断；候车、坐车、乘船、住店，都成为学习的好时机。大家的口号是：“书本随时带身边，等车坐船抓时间，每天挤出一点半，十年之后赛状元。”这个学习运动，已经成为一个波澜壮阔、持久不懈的群众运动。
    一年来，文化学习已开始取得巨大的成绩。个人全年学习时间一般达到五百至六百小时。参加中学课程学习的干部，除学完三分之一以上中学语文外，还学完了两门或三门数学课程（算术、代数、几何、三角）。年度大考，及格率达97．2％，总平均八十五点一分。经过一年学习，干部文化水平有了明显的提高，对工作、学习、思想等各个方面，都产生了巨大作用。首先为干部学习军事科学，掌握军事技术，提高训练部队的能力，创造了条件。过去，干部由于缺乏数学知识，对于一些军事技术中的公式，常常是凭死记、硬背，现在数学知识增长了，不仅懂得快，而且记得牢。通过语文学习，进一步提高了干部的阅读和写作能力，特别是对学习毛主席著作，有很大的帮助和推动。1959年，我们部队在各种报刊上刊登的稿件比1958年增加了40％。团以上的政治干部多数人写出了较好的工作报告。据某师统计，全师干部今年来买政治书籍达二万一千余册。很多干部还由于文化水平的提高，感到“心窍大开”，工作信心倍增。有的干部用“三愁变三喜”来概括自己一年来的文化学习收获，说过去是：“一愁备课困难讲不好，二愁有了经验写不了，三愁军事科学攻不倒”；现在是：“一喜心灵手又巧，二喜笔杆顺心跑，三喜文武双提高”。
    一年来，干部文化教育的主要经验就是要坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动。具体来说，我们有以下六个方面的体会。
    不断地鼓干劲、反右倾、破保守
    总政治部普及中、高等教育的宏伟规划公布后，广大干部热烈拥护，欢欣鼓舞。但是也有人缺乏雄心大志，认为“学点语文、算术就行了，学那么多干啥？”更多的人则是缺乏信心，说什么：“大老粗怎么能当大学生？”“工作这样忙，哪有时间学文化？要学就得进学校？”“军队又没有大学教授，那能搞高等教育？”归纳起来是三个问题，即：“需不需要学？”“在职能不能学？”“学习主要依靠谁？”据此，我们在1959年春季开展了一个大张旗鼓的文化教育宣传运动。首先在各级党委和领导干部中明确认识。统一语言，以后是自上而下地逐级发动；人人开口，个个宣传。着重讲清文化教育的重大意义，说明军队文化教育是全国文化革命的一个组成部分，军队干部应该积极响应党的文化革命的伟大号召。说明党中央和毛主席历来关怀部队的文化教育，认真开展文化教育工作是我军的光荣传统。特别是说明文化知识是打开现代化军事科学和政治理论宝库的钥匙，为了使我军加强革命化和加速现代化，必须提高文化科学知识水平。说明普及中、高等教育，是提高我军干部质量，加强我军建设的迫切的重大任务之一。同时，我们又大力宣扬了各方面的学习标兵。通过这样一场鸣放辩论和宣传教育，干部们认清了形势，增强了信心，打破了自卑感，批判了怀疑论，克服了形形色色的右倾保守思想，澄清了糊涂观念，一个前所未有的学习高潮就形成了。
    但是思想工作并不是一劳永逸的。文化学习一鼓作气并不难，持之以恒就不容易。因此，思想工作必须随着运动的发展而逐步深入，不间断的贯彻于过程的始终。可以说普及中、高等教育的过程，也就是不间断地进行思想发动和思想斗争的过程。我们以不断革命的思想指导运动的发展，通过三次现场会，四次较大的辩论会，运用了许多好坏典型作鲜明对照，在各个阶段都提出了明确的努力目标，以及各级党委不间断地进行思想工作，就使干部们的认识逐步提高，不断前进，使群众的学习运动持续不懈，终于赢得了高速优质、大面积丰收。
    适应部队在职干部的特点，采取灵活多样的办学形式
    我们部队守卫在祖国的边防，执行着训练、施工、参加社会主义建设等各种任务；驻地有的比较集中，有的比较分散；广大干部的专业门类繁多；文化程度不一，要求各异；而且因为开会、集训、当兵、出差、参加地方工作等，干部外出多，流动性大。在职干部又必须以工作为主；在学习上军事、政治、专业与文化学习任务都很重。这就要求在教学上，除坚决贯彻总政指示的以在职业余自学为主外，组织形式应该灵活多样而又严密。因时因地因人制宜，才能在各种情况下坚持学习。各部队在灵活运用教学组织形式上有许多创造，例如某炮团在野营训练的复杂而困难的情况下，他们仍然采用多种形式，顽强坚持了文化学习。如走前突击、中途“消化”；把学习任务交给党支部包干，以连为单位组织学习，团、营统一组织几个报员组，蹲点和巡回教学等。在二十六天野营中，不仅取得了战术射击总评良好的成绩；同时，干部们平均学了六十小时左右的文化，除学一至二章新课外，每人平均还做了六十七道旧课复习题。对外出干部的学习，各部队也作了妥善安排：如“把好出入口”，凡是个别外出的都交代学习任务，走前突击，在外巩固；几个人外出的编成学习小组，成批外出的跟去教员，组成“临时中学”等。回队后都要检查“验收”，有缺必补。有了灵活的教学方式，就使学习既能广泛开展，又可长期坚持。
    经过一年来的实践，我们摸到了开展在职干部学习的一套切合实际的办法，这就是：以在职学习为主，短期集训为辅；统一领导，分级管理，连队（支部）扎根，计划落户；长计划、短安排；长流水、不断线与组织大小学习高潮相结合；大、中、小学并举；按照干部现有文化程度和工作情况，用多种组织形式，分别组织起来；根据不同情况，提出不同要求。这样就能照顾多数、全面动员、实行广泛的群众路线，采取不同的方式，朝着普及中、高等教育的目标前进。
    大力开展自学活动，培养干部自学习惯，为运动深入持久打下基础
    广大干部养成了自学习惯，就可以在各种困难条件下坚持学习，避免三天打鱼、两天晒网的现象。有人说：“自学是个宝，风吹不散、雷打不倒。”自学也是提高教学质量极为重要的因素。因为只有独立思考，学够时数，完成作业，才能记得牢靠，领会深刻，达到融会贯通和熟练。自学是一切学习方式的基础。“自己不吃饭，永远不会饱。”事实证明，干部自学习惯的养成是无价之宝，是学习运动深入和持久的基础。
    要干部养成自学的习惯，要经过一个由不够自觉到自觉，由缺乏毅力到有毅力，由不够习惯到形成习惯的过程。这是需要做许多细致的思想工作和组织工作。根据一年多来的经验，首先要做好思想发动工作，使干部树立雄心壮志，鼓足革命干劲，明确学习方向，树立标兵，开展学标兵、赶标兵的运动。同时，还要作好讨论学习指标、订出个人学习计划、组织互助、安排对自学进行指导和定期进行检查、评比等组织工作，使干部逐渐养成自学的习惯。而对干部自学的具体领导与监督，主要是依靠党支部来抓，把思想工作和组织措施与日常工作、生活结合起来，长期坚持下去。群教群学，能者为师，建立和
    培养一支坚强的教员队伍
    建立和培养一支坚强的教员队伍，是完成“十年大计”的重要保证。而部队的专职教员数量很少，水平也不高。教员哪里来呢？我们坚决执行了总政治部的指示，采取了“群教群学，能者为师”、“以专职教员为骨干，以兼职教员为主体”的群众路线的办法，迅速建成了一支人数众多的教员队伍。到去年年底，教员人数已为年初的十倍，平均每五个学员就有一名教员，每个教学班有两、三名教员。兼职教员为专职教员的四倍，其中包括了各级、各类干部和不少士兵。
    这样做，能不能教得好呢？事实证明是可以教得好的。兼职教员的优越性是：在本单位教学，熟悉学员，熟悉本行业务，便于因人施教，联系实际，学用结合，因为和学员在一起，便于和学员打成一片，随时随地进行教学。他们的文化底子虽然薄些，但他们全心全意为学员服务，先学一步，认真备课，善于走群众路线，绝大多数是可以胜任的。据某师调查，能够教得好，受群众欢迎的占80％，去年立功、受奖的教员占59％。有些教师原来水平上虽然不高，由于他们边教边学自修，现在已学完大部分高中课程，这样“水涨船高”，将来还可以担任高等课程的教员。现在的教员和大学班的学员，就是将来普及高等教育的教员队伍的主力军。
    不断进行教学改革，使教育为建军服务，使学习多快好省
    我军普及中高等教育，只能是为军队建设服务，为无产阶级政治服务。因此文化教育必须做到学用一致，边学边用。关于教学的内容，总政治部在编写教材时已经进行了改革，削减了我军干部不十分需要的部分，增加了迫切需要的内容。我们在进行教学中，一方面强调打好基础，稳步前进；一方面在课程安排上急用先学，在内容上紧密地联系实际。为了解决联系实际问题，我们收集了大量的现实问题来充实教材。在教学方面，发动教员和学员，从部队需要出发，根据部队训练、技术革新、施工修建、助民劳动、副业生产等工作，生活中遇到的实际问题，编写了大量的应用题。并联系解决大家阅读、写作中遇到的疑难问题。这样教学生动实际、学了就能用，效果立竿见影，学员学习兴趣浓厚，也有助于长期坚持。
    在教学中，我们还根据在职干部学习的特点，将系统的课堂教学和发动群众，开展多种多样的课外教学活动结合起来，实行两条腿走路。即发动干部结合工作、学习和日常生活，在课外开展大演大算、大读大写、精读精写、日日练习活动。这种课外教学活动，不但巩固和加深了课本上学得的知识，而且抓到许多学习时间，学到许多实用的新知识，并且直接有利于工作，也有助于养成自学习惯。两条腿走路是多快好省的学习办法。要求教员要深入到群众中去，千方百计指导干部学习。
    领导干部深入教学，边学习，边领导，先当学生，后当领导
    随着普及中、高等教育工作的不断发展，要求各级领导对文化教育实施具体的、切实的、而不是一般化的领导。文化教育对许多领导同志来说，是不熟悉的。为了改变这种状况，我们首先强调宣传毛主席的“实践论”的观点，
  “你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”强调各级领导要深入到教学实践中去，摸索规律，找出贯彻执行教学方针、力争高速优质的具体道路，通过教学领导教学。同时，我们又在一次现场会议上，由军、师领导同志带头登台讲课，做了示范。从此，各级领导同志纷纷投入教学实践，亲自抓教学了。我们领导深入教学的主要方式有三种：一是跟班听课，当好学生，从中体会如何学、如何教，帮助教员和学员改进教与学的方法；二是直接参加备课、讲课、批改作业、总结经验等活动，从中寻找改进教学方法、改革教学内容的途径；三是深入一校一班，“解剖麻雀”，踏踏实实地进行调查研究，就地检查，就地指导，纠正缺点，总结与推广先进经验。一年来，我们部队营以上领导干部有百余人曾登台讲课；团以上领导干部对文化教育工作进行了多次考察，写出了较系统的调查材料四十二篇。这些活动，及时地发现和解决了文化教育工作中的问题，有力地推动了文化教育工作的持续跃进。
