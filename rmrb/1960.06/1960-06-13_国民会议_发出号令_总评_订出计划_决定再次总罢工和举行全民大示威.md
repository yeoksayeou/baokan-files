Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th: The "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," of Japan, issued a battle call to joint struggle organizations in all prefectures on the 11th: On the 15th, rallies and demonstrations on a scale larger than the unified action of June 4th, with the working class's second general strike at its core, will be held simultaneously throughout the country to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The National Council's directive also stipulates that, starting from the 13th, marches will be organized daily to demonstrate in front of the Diet, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's unilateral "deliberation" of the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors.

The directive stipulates that on the 14th, Tokyo's joint struggle organizations will hold rallies in various districts of the city and stage a large-scale demonstration to the Diet. On the 15th, various groups will organize marches to the Diet to demonstrate; on the same day, joint struggle organizations in each prefecture will send as many representatives as possible to Tokyo to participate in the demonstration.

The National Council also directed joint struggle organizations in each prefecture to fully carry out a signature collection campaign starting from the 12th and called on all people to launch vigorous propaganda activities to support the second general strike to be held by workers nationwide on the 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of member union representatives this afternoon and decided on a plan to hold a more powerful second general strike on the 15th. Sohyo announced that the goals of the general strike are: to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and to dissolve the Diet.

According to the plan, workers in private enterprises in various industries throughout Japan will hold a twenty-four-hour strike, longer than the first general strike. Civil servants in government agencies and public utilities will hold two-hour workplace rallies during working hours.

Kyodo News said that this general strike, held when Eisenhower is about to visit Japan, will "have a subtle impact on the tense political situation."

The plan stipulates that the National Railway Workers' Union, which played the main role in the first general strike, will hold large-scale two-hour workplace rallies focusing on the cargo transportation sector in twelve locations nationwide. The Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation will hold a nationwide timed strike, on a larger scale than the first general strike. The National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, composed of train drivers, will also launch a "maximum" show of force.

The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union will hold rallies in 200 post offices nationwide, and the All Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union, the All Printing Bureau Workers' Union, and the Alcohol Monopoly Workers' Union will also hold workplace rallies.

Local government civil servants will hold one-hour workplace rallies. In Tokyo, 30% of government employees will take leave to petition the Diet against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

In the private sector, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All Japan Federation of Metal Mine Workers' Unions, the National Federation of Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions, the National Federation of Automobile Transport Workers' Unions, the All-Japan Day Laborers' Union, the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, and the National General Contract Workers' Union Federation will hold twenty-four-hour strikes.
