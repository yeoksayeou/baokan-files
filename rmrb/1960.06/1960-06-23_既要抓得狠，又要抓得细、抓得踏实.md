Not Only Grasp Vigorously, But Also Grasp Meticulously and Steadfastly

    On June 17th, this newspaper published a news report about the West Mountain Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province, which insisted on using coal loading machines, gradually consolidating and improving this significant technological innovation in coal production, and exceeding its production plan for five consecutive months. A very important reason why the West Mountain Mining Bureau was able to achieve such great results in promoting coal loading machines is that the leadership style of this mining bureau is relatively thorough, not only grasping vigorously but also grasping meticulously and steadfastly, thus being able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. As early as January of this year, the West Mountain Mining Bureau fully promoted coal loading machines, increasing production efficiency by one and a half times. In this situation, if the leadership style were not steadfast and thorough, it would be easy to assume that everything was going well, and that there were no more problems with the promotion of coal loading machines. However, the comrades of the West Mountain Mining Bureau did not think this way. They noted that the promotion of any new technology must have a process of consolidation and improvement, and must go through in-depth work before it can be consistently used in production. They found that although coal loading machines had been fully promoted, there were still some problems in terms of consistent use, such as some coal loaders putting the coal loading machines aside and still using shovels. The problem was discovered, but if the leadership work was generalized, it was likely that they would only hold a meeting and verbally emphasize the need to adhere to the use of coal loading machines, considering it a "completed task." In this way, although the problem was discovered, it still could not be solved. The comrades of the West Mountain Mining Bureau did not adopt this method of making only general appeals. They went deep into the front line of production, both to units where coal loading machines were used well and to units where coal loading machines were not used well, to investigate, research, and get to the bottom of the various ideological, technical, material, and management reasons why coal loading machines could not be fully and normally used, and then organized forces to solve them one by one. The coal loading machines were not very flexible or perfect, so they mobilized the masses to improve them seventeen times, making them more flexible and perfect. Workers were not yet proficient in operating coal loading machines, so they selected forty-four pace-setters in operating coal loading machines from the entire bureau, organized them to perform in various pits, and imparted their skills. Then, they widely organized a training and competition movement among groups, teams, and pits in the use of coal loading machines, so that all coal loaders could skillfully master the operation of coal loading machines. Because they grasped vigorously, meticulously, and steadfastly, and were able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, the use of coal loading machines was finally consolidated in the West Mountain Mining Bureau, making the fruits of the technological revolution truly a powerful tool for promoting production leaps.

    Now, the good situation on the industrial front is encouraging leaders at all levels of factories and mines to go deep into the front line of production, promote the continued leap forward in production, and do a good job in preparing for the third quarter. When going deep into the front line, we must bring this style of grasping vigorously, meticulously, and steadfastly to the front line.

    Being vigorous is a kind of revolutionary spirit, a consistently enthusiastic support for all new things, and a determination and perseverance to never give up until the goal is achieved. For us revolutionaries, this vigor, this vigorous work style, is an expression of revolutionary will. In revolutionary war, this vigor is needed to defeat the enemy; in the struggle for production, this vigor is also needed to seize a bumper harvest. Revolutionary war is a bloody struggle of life and death. The enemy is fierce. If you are not vigorous, you may be eliminated by the enemy. Although the struggle for production is different from fighting a war, it is as much a part of the proletarian revolutionary cause as revolutionary war is, and requires a strong revolutionary will and a burst of vigor to thoroughly solve the problems in production development in order to promote the high-speed development of production. The great leap forward in production and construction in all walks of life, the widespread promotion and consistent use of many new technologies, and the blooming of "small-scale modern groups" and "small-scale indigenous groups" are all related to the development of a vigorous revolutionary style.

    With vigor, one must also be meticulous and steadfast. What is meticulousness and steadfastness? That is, work should involve thorough investigation, scientific analysis, and a pragmatic approach to all issues, so that the subjective conforms to the objective. To achieve success in anything we do, we must make our subjective understanding conform to objective reality. This pragmatic style of ensuring that the subjective conforms to the objective is the fine tradition of our Party, and the Marxist-Leninist style that must be possessed to understand and transform the objective world. Although the objective world is complex, and doing a good job in a revolutionary task is not easy, as long as we dare to think and dare to act, and establish a pragmatic style, working meticulously and steadfastly, ensuring that the subjective conforms to the objective, we can grasp the laws of motion of objective things and achieve victory in all tasks. Lacking a pragmatic style, being unsteadfast and not meticulous, and failing to ensure that the subjective conforms to the objective, it is difficult to do a good job. Taking the consistent use of new technologies, new equipment, and new tools as an example, whether they can be consistently used is often caused by many reasons. Among them are ideological reasons, such as whether one has full enthusiasm for new things; technical reasons, such as some new technologies, new equipment, and new tools may not be very perfect and need to be continuously improved, or even if they are perfect, workers may not be easy to master them for a while, and it is necessary to organize large-scale technical training; there are also material reasons, such as whether the necessary spare parts have been prepared and can be replaced and used in a timely manner; and there are also management reasons, such as whether labor organization, process regulations, etc., have been adjusted and revised accordingly. Only by doing the work meticulously and steadfastly can these detailed reasons be found, and effective measures can be taken to solve these problems. Being careless and missing things, lacking investigation and analysis, this un-meticulous and un-steadfast style cannot do things well. Examining our various achievements in production, they are all the result of developing a scientific style that combines vigorous and meticulous efforts.

    Grasping vigorously and grasping meticulously must be combined. Being vigorous without being meticulous is empty vigor. If one holds meetings all day long, relying only on repeated orders and injunctions, seemingly acting vigorously, but not basing one's work on meticulous scientific analysis, isn't this vigor empty? Being meticulous without being vigorous cannot solve major problems. Analyzing specific problems in detail, with good reason, but lacking the determination and swiftness to solve problems thoroughly, this meticulousness will not have any effect. We must combine vigor and meticulousness. The unity of vigor and meticulousness is the unity of soaring revolutionary drive and scientific analysis, the unity of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy. With this revolutionary spirit and leadership style that unites soaring revolutionary drive and scientific analysis, that unites strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy, and that unites vigor and meticulousness, we can be invincible.

    Only the last few days of the first half of the year remain. More and more enterprises have achieved the call to complete half of the annual plan ahead of schedule in the first half of the year. Now, the tasks before us are, on the one hand, to continue to seize the last few days of the first half of the year and strive to achieve greater achievements in production; on the other hand, to make full preparations for the next step, first of all for production in July, to ensure that the rate of production growth in July is greater than that in June. Production and production preparations are linked, and we must not only grasp vigorously, grasping to the end without any slackening, but also grasp meticulously and steadfastly, not ignoring every small link. Leaders at all levels of industrial and mining enterprises, go to the front line of production to grasp vigorously, meticulously, and steadfastly, and continue to develop the high tide of production wave after wave!

### 既要抓得狠，又要抓得细、抓得踏实

    既要抓得狠，又要抓得细、抓得踏实
    6月17日，本报发表了山西省西山矿务局坚持使用攉煤机，使煤炭生产上这项重大的技术革新逐步得到巩固、提高，连续五个月超额完成生产计划的新闻。西山矿务局推广攉煤机能取得这么大的成绩，一个很重要的原因就是这个矿务局的领导作风比较深入，不但抓得狠，而且抓得细，抓得踏实，因而能够及时发现问题，解决问题。早在今年1月，西山矿务局就全面推广了攉煤机，使生产效率提高了一倍半。在这种情况下，如果领导作风不踏实不深入，就很可能以为万事大吉，攉煤机的推广已经没有什么问题了。可是西山矿务局的同志们不是这样。他们注意到任何新技术的推广，都必须有一个巩固、提高的过程，都必须经过一番深入的工作，才能在生产中坚持使用。他们发现攉煤机虽然全面推广了，但是在坚持使用方面还存在一些问题，如有些攉煤工把攉煤机放在一旁，仍然在使用铁锹。问题是发现了，如果领导工作一般化，也很可能只是开一次会，在口头上强调一下要坚持使用攉煤机，就算“完成任务”了。这样，问题虽然发现了，却还是不能解决。西山矿务局的同志们，也没有采取这种只作一般号召的办法，他们深入到生产第一线，既到攉煤机使用得好的单位，也到攉煤机使用得不够好的单位，调查研究，寻根究底，找出了攉煤机没有能全面正常使用的思想上的、技术上的、物质上的、管理上的种种原因，然后组织力量一一解决。攉煤机还不很灵巧，不很完善，便发动群众前后经过十七次改进，使之更灵巧、更完善。工人对攉煤机的操作还不熟练，便从全局选拔出操作攉煤机的标兵四十四人，组织他们到各坑去表演，传授技术，紧接着便广泛组织组与组、队与队、坑与坑之间使用攉煤机的练武比武竞赛运动，使所有的攉煤工都熟练地掌握了攉煤机的操作。由于抓得狠、抓得细、抓得踏实，能够及时发现问题，及时解决问题，攉煤机的使用终于在西山矿务局巩固下来，使技术革命的成果，真正成为促进生产跃进的有力工具。
    现在，工业战线上的良好形势，正鼓舞着厂矿企业的各级领导干部深入生产第一线，促进生产继续跃进，和做好第三季度的准备工作。在深入第一线的时候，我们一定要把这种抓得狠、抓得细、抓得踏实的作风带到第一线去。
    狠，是一种革命的气魄，是对一切新生事物始终热情的支持，是百折不回、不达目的誓不罢休的决心和毅力。对于我们革命者说来，这种狠劲，这种狠的工作作风，是革命意志的表现。在革命战争中，要有这种狠劲，才能克敌制胜；在生产斗争中，也要有这种狠劲，才能夺取丰收。革命战争是你死我活的流血斗争，敌人是凶恶的，你不狠，就可能被敌人消灭。生产斗争虽然同打仗不同，但是它同革命战争一样，也是无产阶级革命事业的一部分，也要有坚强的革命意志，拿出一股狠劲来，彻底地解决生产发展中的问题，才能促进生产高速度地发展。各行各业生产建设事业的大跃进，许许多多新技术的普遍推广和坚持使用，“小洋群”和“小土群”的遍地开花等等翻天复地的变革，都和发扬抓得狠的革命作风有关。
    狠了，还要细，还要踏实。何谓细和踏实？即在工作中要有周密的调查，科学的分析，对待一切问题要实事求是，使主观同客观一致。我们做任何事情，要想得到成功，都必须使自己的主观认识符合客观实际。这种主观同客观一致的实事求是的作风，是我们党的优良传统，是认识客观世界、改造客观世界必须具有的马克思列宁主义的作风。客观世界虽然是复杂的，办好一件革命工作并不是轻而易举的，但只要我们敢想敢干，又树立起实事求是的作风，工作做得细，做得踏实，主观同客观一致，就可以掌握客观事物运动的规律，取得各项工作的胜利。缺乏实事求是的作风，不踏实，不细致，主观同客观不一致，就很难把工作做好。拿新技术、新设备、新工具的坚持使用来说，能不能坚持使用，常常是由许多原因造成的。其中有思想上的原因，例如对新生事物是不是怀有满腔热情；有技术上的原因，例如有些新的技术、新的设备和新的工具可能还不十分完善，需要不断地加以改进，或者虽然是完善的，但是工人一时还不容易掌握，需要组织技术大练兵；也有物质上的原因，例如是不是准备了必要的备品，能够及时替换使用；还有管理上的原因，例如劳动组织、工艺规程等等是不是作了相应的调整和修订。只有工作做得细致，做得踏实，才能找出这些具体入微的不同方面的原因，才能采取有效的措施，来解决这些问题。粗枝大叶，挂一漏万，没有调查，没有分析，这种不细致不踏实的作风，是不能把事情办好的。考查一下我们在生产事业上的各项成就，莫不都是发扬了狠抓和细抓相结合的科学作风的结果。
    抓得狠和抓得细要结合起来。狠而不细，狠是空狠。如果整天开会，只靠三令五申下命令，看似雷厉风行，却不把自己的工作建立在细致的科学分析的基础上，这种狠劲岂不是空的吗？细而不狠，也不能解决大问题。对具体问题分析得很细致，头头是道，但是没有彻底解决问题的决心和雷厉风行的气魄，这种细致是不会有什么效果的。我们要把狠和细结合起来，狠和细的统一，是冲天的革命干劲和科学分析精神的统一，是战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人的统一。有了这种把冲天的革命干劲和科学分析精神统一起来，把在战略上藐视敌人和在战术上重视敌人统一起来、把狠和细统一起来的革命精神和领导作风，我们就能无往而不胜。
    上半年只剩下最后几天的时间了。越来越多的企业提前实现了上半年完成全年计划一半的号召。现在，摆在我们面前的任务，一方面是要继续抓紧上半年这最后几天的时间，争取在生产上取得更大的成就；另一方面是要为下一步，首先是为7月份的生产作好充分的准备，保证7月份生产增长的幅度比6月份更大。生产和生产的准备工作，都是环环相扣的，既要抓得狠，一抓到底，毫不松懈，又要抓得细，抓得踏实，不忽视每一个细小的环节。工矿企业的各级领导干部，到生产第一线去狠抓、细抓、踏实地抓，把生产高潮一浪高一浪地持续发展下去！
