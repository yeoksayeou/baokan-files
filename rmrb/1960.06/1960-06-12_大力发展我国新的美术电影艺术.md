Vigorously Develop China's New Fine Arts Film Art
Representative of the Shanghai Fine Arts Film Studio Hu Jinqing

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction and inspired by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the staff of the Shanghai Fine Arts Film Studio have adhered to the Party's literary and artistic policies, vigorously engaged in mass movements, and achieved great successes in ideology, creation, production, and technology. In the past two years, our studio's output has surged from an average annual production of five films before 1958 to forty-seven films, an increase of more than eight times. The cost has decreased from an average of 33,000 yuan per film to the current 15,000 yuan, a reduction of 55%. The shooting time has been shortened from an average of 180 days per film to the current 120 days, a reduction of one-third, and the quality of the films has also been significantly improved. Of the forty-two fine arts films produced by our studio, one has won an international award, and three have been selected as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. More than twenty films, such as "Catching Up with England," "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest," "Stories in Murals," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," "A Zhuang Brocade," "Little Agronomist," "Little Inventor," and "The Fisherman Boy," have been warmly welcomed by audiences after being released domestically. In particular, our studio has promoted innovation, broken through the old scope of fairy tales, folk stories, and myths, and filmed films on modern themes such as the Great Leap Forward, children's lives, and political satire. We have created new types, new styles, new styles, and new techniques of fine arts films, bringing fine arts films to a new stage and initially forming our unique national style of fine arts films.

Open up new fields of fine arts film themes

For a long time, the themes of fine arts films were limited to the framework of old fairy tales, folk stories, and myths. In 1958, after the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the ideological consciousness of the creative staff of our factory was greatly improved, and they realized that the basic task of fine arts films, like other types of films and literary and artistic work, should follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Revolutionary literature and art should create all kinds of characters based on actual life to help the masses push history forward." Especially after the Party's general line for socialist construction was put forward, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production appeared throughout the country, and fine arts film creators all had a strong desire to reflect real life and cooperate with the current political struggle. For example, some directors said: "In today's new socialist era full of revolutionary miracles and revolutionary ideals, if fine arts films are still always drawing ancient people and drawing kittens and puppies, it is too inconsistent with the times." Some said: "We must reflect real life and blaze a new trail." These strong desires converged into a huge force and began to fiercely impact the old ideas and frameworks that fine arts films were difficult to reflect real life. First of all, everyone demanded to put down the originally planned folk stories and myths such as "Nine-Colored Deer" and "Learning Immortality" and enrich modern themes. A group of young comrades were particularly active. After the Party Central Committee put forward the fighting call to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in major industrial output in about fifteen years, they collectively created a political satire film "Catching Up with England." When China successfully trial-produced reactive dyes, it created another "Wonderful Colors." At the same time, it also filmed a number of films praising the general line, praising the Great Leap Forward, and praising the heroic ambitions and soaring energy of the Chinese working people, such as "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest" and "Singing the General Line." These films are new in both content and form, and are full of the atmosphere of the times. However, there are still certain difficulties in how to use the artistic form of fine arts films to express real themes more perfectly and to combine the strong desire of creators to reflect real life with actual life knowledge. At that time, the leaders of our factory organized everyone to discuss and study on the one hand; and focused on grasping the already successful films reflecting real themes, affirmed achievements, adhered to the direction, and encouraged everyone to continue to explore and practice; on the other hand, they organized everyone to go deep into life and participate in actual struggles. With the strong support of the leaders of our factory, films such as "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," "The Cuckoo Calls Late," "Little Agronomist," and "Little Inventor" appeared one after another. ("Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate" also won a silver medal at the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival.) At the same time, our factory also produced several political satire films such as "Who Sings Best," "Pigeon," and "Lobster." In March and April this year, driven by the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution, our factory used more than a month to produce two animated films and two puppet films with different styles and styles, with the current technical revolution as the content. Such a rapid reflection of real life and cooperation with the current political situation is an innovation in fine arts film creation and production. According to statistics, since the Great Leap Forward, a total of forty-eight films have been made, of which twenty-three are modern themes (before the Great Leap Forward, twenty-seven films were made in the past ten years, and only four were modern themes). All of these films are full of the breath of life of this great era and show the spirit of the Chinese working people daring to think and act. Therefore, fine arts films are not only an important tool for educating children and cultivating communist successors, but also an effective ideological education tool and a good artistic form of cultural life for adults.

Mark the new of the nation and establish the difference of the nation

Before 1958, fine arts films only had two types: puppet and animation. Since the Great Leap Forward, paper-cut films, origami films, and ink-wash animation films have been created. The birth of these new types and new forms embodies the pioneering spirit of Chinese fine arts films and implements the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and weed through the old to bring forth the new." In the spring of 1958, in order to enable fine arts film creation to better absorb the essence of folk art traditions, our factory sent some creative staff to Shaanxi, Hunan and other places to watch shadow puppet shows and puppet shows and collect materials. At that time, Wan Guchan and other comrades, seeing the extremely rich folk art such as shadow puppet shows, window grilles, and paper-cuts in the motherland, had the desire to put these gorgeous and colorful traditional arts on the silver screen of fine arts films. After knowing this, the Party leadership of our factory strongly supported them and immediately formed a group to conduct trial production. During the trial production process, a series of difficulties were encountered in exploring and creating character modeling, character movements, scenery, and shooting methods. The leadership tried every means to help overcome these difficulties. If there was no camera, they tried every means to buy it. If they could not buy a new one, they bought an old one. If there was no camera stand, the carpenters made a wooden frame to replace it. If the manpower was not enough, they immediately transferred the backbone of young creators from the animation department to support them. After many experiments, when the ideal requirements could not be met, some of the creative staff were somewhat discouraged and afraid that they would not succeed and would be sorry to the Party. After knowing this, the leadership immediately encouraged everyone to strengthen their confidence and persist in the experiment. Under the enthusiastic encouragement and strong support of the leadership, after eight or nine months of trial production, the first paper-cut film "Pig Bajie Eating Watermelon" was finally successfully shot. This innovative achievement deeply moved all our creative cadres. Comrade Wan Guchan shed tears of excitement. Under the encouragement of victory, three more paper-cut films such as "The Fisherman Boy" have been shot in the past two years, which have been welcomed and praised by the majority of audiences.

The birth of paper-cut films has further encouraged the heroic ambitions of the creative staff of our factory to be innovative. In the technical revolution movement, we created ink animation. The emergence of ink animation has opened a new page in the history of animation. It applies Chinese traditional art, ink painting, which is loved by the broad masses of the Chinese people and praised by people all over the world, to animated films, which greatly improves and develops the expression forms and techniques of animated films and enriches the national characteristics of fine arts films. At the same time, its creation also created conditions for other forms of Chinese painting to be put on the screen. In the technical revolution movement, we also made another new type of film, origami film, based on the three-dimensional origami method of children's manual work. This new type of film has novel and unique shapes, lively and vivid movements, and is particularly rich in children's fun. It is a new tool for early childhood education. At present, our factory is also filming "three-dimensional puppet films" and conducting research and experiments on new types of films such as "multi-synthetic fine arts films" and "insert wood films," which will make greater contributions to enriching the treasure house of Chinese fine arts film art.

Create new skills and new methods for fine arts films

For many years, people have always believed that fine arts films can only be drawn one by one, carved one by one, and shot frame by frame, and it is difficult to carry out technical innovations. Since the Great Leap Forward, the staff of our factory have deeply felt that this handicraft-style operation method is far from meeting the requirements of the rapid development of the fine arts film industry, and they have begun to reform and explore certain technologies and methods. However, at the beginning, some comrades still had a tendency to aim too high and be divorced from reality, thinking that to change, they must completely turn over and come up with "puppet automation" and radio remote control. After learning about this situation, the leadership clearly pointed out that technical innovation and technical revolution must be carried out around the requirements of improving production efficiency and film quality, and encouraged everyone to create and innovate in these aspects. Because the direction was correct and the leadership strongly supported it, in this year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we achieved "a revolution every five days" and innovated 55 projects in one fell swoop, including the ink animation mentioned above, which some people thought was "impossible to do in a lifetime." The puppet foot nails, which were always considered unchangeable, were removed, and the continuous shooting of paper-cut movements was basically solved. The removal of the puppet foot nails greatly reduced the labor intensity of the manipulators, accelerated the working speed, and reduced the shaking of the puppets, improving the artistic quality of the puppet films. The realization of partial continuous shooting of paper-cut films has increased the shooting speed by more than ten times and enriched certain expression techniques that are not available in frame-by-frame shooting.

Cultivate young cadres and boldly use new forces

In the past two years, in the process of creating and innovating in film types, themes, and technologies, more than 30 young creative cadres who can write scripts have been trained from the original personnel with general painting and production technology. They have written more than 30 scripts, of which 11 have been adopted, accounting for 26% of our factory's film production. Six young directors and those who have reached the level of directors have been trained, and they have filmed 12 films, accounting for 28.5% of our factory's film production. Twenty-nine young painters (original painting, animation, art design) with a certain level have been trained, accounting for 38% of the painting staff. Twelve young technical and artistic cadres such as photographers and puppet manipulators have been trained. In addition, 18 fine arts film creators have been trained for fraternal units such as Changchun Film Studio and Pearl River Film Studio. The growth of these new forces has greatly changed the creative, production, and ideological outlook of our factory and powerfully promoted the development of creative and innovative movements.

This practice of boldly using and cultivating new forces has also encountered many difficulties. First of all, these young comrades have less knowledge and lack experience. At the same time, some old directors and experts lack confidence in their ability to shoulder such complex creative production tasks. However, the leaders of our factory believe that the growth of new forces is the key to the rapid development of the fine arts film industry, so they have adopted an attitude of boldly letting go, enthusiastically supporting, and specifically helping. On the one hand, they actively encourage young creative cadres to break superstitions, liberate their minds, learn humbly, and study hard. On the other hand, they deeply mobilize experienced creative cadres to provide specific guidance to young people. In order to solve the difficulties of young people's lack of experience, they also organize them to carry out collective creation so that they can study each other, learn from each other's strengths, make up for their weaknesses, and improve together. In addition, the method of training classes is adopted to more systematically enrich their professional knowledge and improve their creative level.

Why can the fine arts film industry develop so fast? This is mainly due to the wise leadership of the Party and the superiority of the socialist system. In the future, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic policy, and all the staff of the factory must go all out, boldly create and innovate, so that fine arts film art can serve proletarian politics more closely, so that fine arts film art can be more prosperous and developed.

    大力发展我国新的美术电影艺术
    上海美术电影制片厂代表  胡进庆
    大跃进以来，上海美术电影制片厂职工在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞下，坚持了党的文艺方针，大搞群众运动，在思想上、创作上、生产上、技术上都取得了巨大的成绩。两年来，我厂产量从1958年以前的平均年产五部猛增至四十七部，增长了八倍以上；成本从原来的平均每部三万三千元减至现在的一万五千元，降低了55％；拍摄时间从原来的平均每部一百八十天缩至现在的一百二十天，缩短了三分之一，影片质量也有了显著的提高。从我厂所拍摄的四十二部美术片来看，获得国际奖的有一部，被选为建国十周年献礼片的有三部。“赶英国”、“庆丰收”、“壁画里的故事”、“大跃进万岁”、“一幅僮锦”以及“小农艺家”、“小发明家”、“渔童”等二十余部影片在国内上映后，深受观众的热烈欢迎。特别是我厂发扬了创新精神，突破了旧的童话、民间故事和神话的题材范围，拍摄了大跃进、儿童生活、政治讽刺等现代题材的影片；创造了美术电影的新片种、新样式、新风格和新技巧，使美术电影发展到一个新的阶段，初步形成了我们美术片民族的独特风格。
    开辟美术电影题材的新领域
    长期以来，美术电影的题材局限于旧的童话、民间故事、神话的框子里。1958年，我厂经过了反右派斗争和整风运动，创作人员的思想觉悟大大提高，认识到美术电影的基本任务与其他片种和文艺工作一样，应该遵循毛主席的教导：“革命的文艺，应该根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来，帮助群众推动历史前进。”特别是在党的社会主义建设总路线提出以后，全国出现了工农业生产大跃进的局面，美术电影创作人员，都有强烈的要求反映现实生活、配合当前政治斗争的愿望。如有的导演说：“在今天这个充满了革命奇迹、革命理想的社会主义新时代里，美术片如果还老是画古人、画小猫小狗，就跟时代太不相称了。”有的说：“我们必须反映现实生活，要闯出一条新的路子来。”这些强烈的愿望，汇成一股巨大的力量，开始向那种认为美术电影难以反映现实生活的旧思想、旧框框猛力冲击。首先，大家要求把原来计划拍摄的民间故事、神话等题材如“九色鹿”、“学仙记”等先放下来，充实现代题材；一批青年同志尤为积极，就在党中央提出要在十五年左右的时间内在主要工业产量方面赶上和超过英国的战斗号召后，他们集体创作了一部政治讽刺片“赶英国”。当我国试制成功活性染料的时候，又创作了一部 “美妙的颜色”；同时，还拍摄了一批歌颂总路线、歌颂大跃进、歌颂我国劳动人民豪情壮志、冲天干劲的影片，如“庆丰收”、“歌唱总路线”等。这些影片，无论内容和形式都是崭新的，充满了时代气息。但是，如何运用美术电影的艺术形式更完美地表现现实题材，并使创作人员要求反映现实生活的强烈愿望和实际的生活知识结合起来，还存在一定的困难。当时，我厂领导一方面组织大家进行讨论研究；并着重抓住已经拍摄成功的反映现实题材的影片，肯定成绩，坚持方向，鼓励大家继续探索、实践；另一方面又组织大家深入生活，参加实际斗争。在我厂领导的大力支持下，“小鲤鱼跳龙门”、“大跃进万岁”、“布谷鸟叫迟了”、“小农艺家”、“小发明家”等影片相继出现了。（“小鲤鱼跳龙门”还获得了1959年莫斯科国际电影节银质奖章。）与此同时，我厂还制作了“谁唱得最好”、“鸽子”、“龙虾”等几部政治讽刺片。今年3、4月间，在技术革新和技术革命高潮的推动下，我厂以一个多月的时间，摄制了以当前技术革命为内容的动画片两部、木偶片两部，而且都有不同的样式和风格。像这样迅速反映现实生活，配合当前政治形势，在美术片创作上和生产上都是创举。根据统计，大跃进以来，一共拍了四十八部影片，现代题材的占了二十三部（大跃进以前，十年来拍了二十七部影片，现代题材的只占四部）。所有这些影片，都充满了这个伟大时代的生活气息，表现了我国劳动人民敢想敢做的精神面貌。因此，美术电影不仅是教育儿童、培养共产主义接班人的重要工具；而且对成年人也是一种有效的思想教育工具和文化生活的良好的艺术形式。
    标民族之新，立民族之异
    1958年以前，美术电影只有木偶、动画两个片种；大跃进以来，创制了剪纸片、折纸片和水墨动画片。这些新片种、新形式的诞生，体现了我国美术电影的首创精神，贯彻了党的
  “百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针。1958年春，我厂为使美术电影创作更好地吸取民间艺术传统的精华，派了一部分创作人员到陕西、湖南等地观摩皮影戏、木偶戏，搜集资料。当时，万古蟾等几位同志，看到祖国皮影戏、窗花、剪纸等极为丰富的民间艺术，就产生了要把这些瑰丽多彩的传统艺术搬上美术片银幕的愿望。我厂党的领导知道后，就大力支持他们，立刻组成一个组进行试制。试制过程中，在探索和创造人物造型、人物动作、布景、拍摄方法等方面，都碰到了一系列的困难。对于这些困难，领导上都想尽办法帮助克服。没有摄影机，就千方百计地去购买，买不到新的，就买旧的；没有摄影架，就由木工同志造个木架子代替；人力不够，立刻从动画部门调动青年创作骨干前往支援。经过多次试验，仍不能达到理想的要求时，部分创作人员有些灰心，怕搞不成功，对不起党。领导知道后，马上鼓励大家要坚定信心，坚持试验。在领导的热情鼓励、大力支持下，经过八、九个月的试制，终于成功地拍摄了第一部剪纸片“猪八戒吃西瓜”。这一创新成就，使我们所有创作干部都深为感动，万古蟾同志激动得落下了眼泪，在胜利的鼓舞下，两年来又拍摄了“渔童”等三部剪纸片，得到广大观众的欢迎和好评。
    剪纸片的诞生，更鼓舞了我厂创作人员要标新立异的豪情壮志。在技术革命运动中，我们创制了水墨动画。水墨动画的出现，揭开了动画历史新的一页。它把我国广大人民所热爱，也为世界各国人民所称誉的我国传统艺术——水墨画，运用到动画片中，这就大大提高和发展了动画片的表现形式和技巧，丰富了美术电影的民族色彩。同时，它的创制也为我国国画中的其它形式搬上银幕，创造了条件。在技术革命运动中，我们还根据幼儿手工劳作的立体折纸方法，制成又一新片种——折纸片。这个新片种，造型新颖别致，动作生动活泼，特别富有儿童趣味，是进行幼儿教育的新工具。目前，我厂还在拍摄“立体木偶片”，又作“多种合成美术片”、“插木片”等新片种的研究试验，将为丰富我国美术电影艺术的宝库作出更大的贡献。
    创造美术电影的新技巧、新方法
      多少年来，人们一直认为美术片只能一张一张地画，一刀一刀地刻，一格一格地拍，很难进行技术革新。大跃进以来，我厂职工深深感到这种手工艺式的操作方法，远不能适应美术电影事业飞速发展的要求，便开始在某些技术和方法上进行改革探索。但一开始有些同志还存在着好高骛远、脱离实际的倾向，认为要改就得彻底翻身，来个“木偶自动化”，无线电远距离操纵。领导上了解到这些情况之后，就明确地指出，技术革新和技术革命必须围绕着提高生产效率和影片质量的要求来进行，并鼓励大家从这些方面去创造、革新。由于方向对头，领导大力支持，在今年的技术革新、技术革命运动中，实现了“五天革个命”，一举革新了五十五个项目，其中就包括上面提到的被某些人认为是“一辈子也办不到”的水墨动画；一向被认为是无法改变的木偶脚钉被革除了，剪纸动作拍摄连续化也基本上解决了。由于木偶脚钉的革除，大大减轻了操纵人员的劳动强度，加快了工作速度，并且减少了木偶的抖动，提高了木偶片的艺术质量；由于实现了剪纸片的部分连续拍摄，提高了拍摄速度十几倍，而且丰富了逐个拍摄所不具备的某些表现技巧。
    培养青年干部，大胆使用新生力量
      两年来，在片种、题材和技术的创造革新过程中，从原来只有一般绘画、生产技术的人员中，培养出能够编写剧本的青年创作干部三十多人，共编写了三十多个剧本，其中被采用的有十一个，占我厂影片产量的26％；培养了青年导演和达到导演水平的六人，共拍摄了十二部影片，占我厂影片的28．5％；培养了具有一定水平的青年绘画（原画、动画、美术设计）人员二十九人，占绘画人员的38％；培养了摄影、木偶操纵等青年技术、艺术干部十二人。此外，还为长春电影制片厂、珠江电影制片厂等兄弟单位培养了美术片创作人员十八人。这些新生力量的成长，大大地改变了我厂创作、生产和思想面貌，有力地推动了创造、革新运动的开展。
    这种大胆使用和培养新生力量的做法，也曾经遇到过不少困难，首先是这些青年同志知识少，缺乏经验；同时，有些老的导演和专家对他们担负如此复杂的创作生产任务还缺乏信心。然而我厂领导认为新生力量的成长是美术电影事业迅速发展的关键，所以采取了大胆放手，热情支持和具体帮助的态度，一方面积极鼓励青年创作干部破除迷信，解放思想，虚心学习，刻苦钻研；另一方面又深入动员有经验的创作干部对青年进行具体辅导。为了解决青年经验不足的困难，还组织他们进行集体创作，使他们互相研究，取长补短，共同提高。此外，还采用训练班的方法，较系统地充实他们的业务知识，提高他们的创作水平。
    美术电影事业为什么能发展这样快呢？这主要是党的英明领导，是社会主义制度的优越。今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，坚决贯彻执行党的文艺方针，全厂职工鼓足干劲，大胆创造革新，使美术电影艺术更紧密地为无产阶级政治服务，从而也使美术电影艺术得到更大的繁荣和发展。
