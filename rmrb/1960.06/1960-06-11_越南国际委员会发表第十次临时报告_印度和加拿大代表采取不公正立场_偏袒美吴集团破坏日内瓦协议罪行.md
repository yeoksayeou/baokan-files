Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam submitted its tenth interim report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina on April 6. The report reviewed the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from February 1, 1959, to January 31, 1960.

The report generally mentioned certain instances of the South Vietnamese authorities violating the Geneva Accords. However, on some major issues related to maintaining the stability of the ceasefire in Vietnam and ensuring the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, the Indian and Canadian representatives on the commission, disregarding the Polish representative's firm opposition and the serious warnings from the Vietnam People's Army, recently passed unjust resolutions violating the Geneva Accords by a majority vote. For example, regarding the implementation of the military clauses of the Geneva Accords, the Indian and Canadian representatives on the commission, on the one hand, had to acknowledge the South Vietnamese authorities' continuous violations of the military clauses. They noted that during the period from February 1959 to January 1960, incidents occurred several times of personnel holding "passes" issued by the South Vietnamese authorities illegally entering the demilitarized zone. The South Vietnamese authorities failed to comply with Article 16(e) of the agreement regarding prior reporting of military personnel entering Vietnam on twelve occasions, and failed to comply with Article 17(e) of the agreement regarding prior reporting of weapons and war materials entering Vietnam on twenty occasions. Furthermore, because the South Vietnamese authorities refused to participate in the joint commission composed of both sides of the ceasefire, the activities of the joint commission have not been restored to this day, thus some important issues concerning the demilitarized zone have not been resolved. However, on the other hand, the Indian and Canadian representatives on the International Commission, disregarding the Polish representative's stern opposition, overturned the commission's previous resolution, which required the withdrawal of the illegally stationed US "Temporary Equipment Replacement Mission" from South Vietnam by the end of June 1959, and passed a new resolution allowing the mission to remain until the end of 1960.

Regarding the issue of the US illegally stationed "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam, the report only stated that the commission was considering the South Vietnamese authorities' response to the commission's inquiry. In fact, the Indian and Canadian representatives on the commission not only failed to, based on the legitimate demands of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the clear provisions of the Geneva Accords, order the immediate withdrawal of the US "Military Assistance Advisory Group" illegally staying in South Vietnam, but also, recently, disregarding the Polish representative's opposition, passed a resolution by a majority vote, arguing that these US military personnel were replacing the French military personnel who had already withdrawn, deeming it permissible to greatly increase the number of US military advisors illegally staying in South Vietnam. The Indian side even stated that "This cannot be regarded as an increase in military personnel and therefore does not violate Article 16 of the agreement."

The report also indicated that the commission had not taken any effective measures regarding the extremely serious violation of the Geneva Accords by the United States using atomic weapons to equip the South Vietnamese army under the guise of the so-called "Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy".

Regarding the implementation of the political clauses of the Geneva Accords, although the report mentioned that the South Vietnamese authorities' attitude towards the clause prohibiting discrimination and retaliation against former resistance personnel (Article 14(c)) had not changed in principle, and the report also recorded that the Vietnam People's Army had submitted eighty-eight accusations to the commission regarding the South Vietnamese authorities' violations of this provision. However, the report did not mention that the commission had taken any effective measures against this serious violation of the Geneva Accords by the South Vietnamese authorities. Not only that, the Indian and Canadian representatives on the commission recently even made an unjust resolution by a majority vote, stating that the South Vietnamese authorities' Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, aimed at persecuting former resistance personnel and patriots, was not related to the Geneva Accords.

As previously reported, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has requested the commission to rescind the aforementioned resolutions made by the Indian and Canadian representatives favoring the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's undermining of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    越南国际委员会发表第十次临时报告
    印度和加拿大代表采取不公正立场
    偏袒美吴集团破坏日内瓦协议罪行
    新华社10日讯　越南国际监察和监督委员会4月6日向关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席提交了第十次临时报告。报告回顾了1959年2月1日到1960年1月31日期间日内瓦协议在越南的实施情况。
    报告一般地提到了南越当局违反日内瓦协议的某些事例。但是，在关系到维护越南停战的稳定和保证日内瓦协议在越南正确履行的一些重大问题上，委员会的印度和加拿大代表竟在不久前不顾波兰代表的坚决反对和越南人民军方面的严重警告，以多数票通过了违反日内瓦协议的不公正的决议。例如在日内瓦协议军事条款的执行方面，委员会的印度和加拿大代表一方面不得不承认南越当局对军事条款的不断违反，如说在1959年2月到1960年1月期间曾数度发生持有南越当局发出的“通行证”的人员非法进入非军事区的事件，南越当局曾十二次没有遵守协定第十六条巳款关于军事人员进入越南应事先提出报告的规定，二十次没有遵守协定第十七条戊款关于武器和作战物资进入越南应事先提出报告的规定，以及由于南越当局拒绝参加由停战双方组成的联合委员会，使得联合委员会的活动至今未能恢复，因而使得有关非军事区的一些重要问题一直未能得到解决。但是另一方面，国际委员会中的印度和加拿大代表却不顾波兰代表的严正反对，竟推翻了委员会以前通过的责成美国非法派驻南越的“临时装备更新团”于1959年6月底以前撤出南越的决议，而且还通过了允许该团留至1960年底的新决议。
    关于美国非法派驻在南越的“军事援助顾问团”问题，报告也只是说，委员会正在考虑南越当局对委员会的征询作出的答复。事实上，委员会的印度和加拿大代表不仅没有根据越南民主共和国方面的正当要求和日内瓦协议的明确规定，责成非法赖在南越的美国“军事援助顾问团”立即撤走，反而在不久以前，不顾波兰代表的反对，以这些美国军事人员是代替早已撤走的法国军事人员为理由，以多数票通过了认为可以大量增加非法赖在南越的美国军事顾问的决议。印度方面甚至还说，“这不能算作增加军事人员，因此并不违反协议第十六条。”
    报告还表明：委员会对于美国以所谓“和平利用原子能合作协定”名义用原子武器装备南越军队这一极严重违反日内瓦协议的问题也没有采取任何有效的措施。
    在日内瓦协议政治条款的实施方面，报告虽然提到南越当局对于不得对前抗战人员施加歧视和报复的条款（十四条丙款）的态度在原则上没有改变，并且报告也记载了越南人民军方面曾经向委员会提出关于南越当局违反这一规定的八十八次指控。但是，报告没有提到委员会对南越当局这一严重违反日内瓦协议的行动采取了任何有效措施。不仅如此，委员会的印度和加拿大代表最近甚至以多数票作出不公正的决议，说南越当局旨在迫害前抗战人员和爱国人士的1959年第十号法令同日内瓦协议无关。
    前已报道，越南民主共和国政府已经要求委员会撤销印度和加拿大代表所作偏袒美国—吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议条款的上述各项决议。
