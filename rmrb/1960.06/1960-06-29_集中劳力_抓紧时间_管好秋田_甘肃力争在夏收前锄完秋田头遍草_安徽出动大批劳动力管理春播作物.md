Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Concentrate labor, seize the time, and manage autumn fields well. A production upsurge of "turning small tasks into big tasks, and managing autumn fields early" is rapidly unfolding in various parts of Gansu Province.
    Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi and other early-sowing areas have weeded, topdressed and watered autumn crops ten days earlier than in previous years. In late-sowing areas such as the Hexi Corridor and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, rushing to sow and managing autumn fields are proceeding simultaneously. All areas are striving to weed autumn fields for the first time before the summer harvest.
    In Gansu Province, because the season is late, autumn field management and summer harvest and planting are carried out simultaneously every year, making summer particularly busy. This year, the wheat area has expanded by 5.2% compared with last year, and autumn field planting has also increased compared with last year. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, not losing a single grain, and replanting in time, Party committees at all levels have proposed early action, early start, turning the current small tasks into big tasks, and seizing the opportunity before the summer harvest to vigorously grasp autumn field management. Various localities have adopted methods such as exchanging, transferring, and drawing to tap labor potential. In areas where sowing is still in progress, male and female laborers are rationally divided; male laborers deliver manure and harrow the land, female laborers weed, and a suitable number of semi-laborers are drawn to participate in the labor of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, freeing up full laborers to participate in field production. In areas where spring sowing has basically ended, in addition to retaining a small number of laborers to continue rushing to expand sowing with moisture and preparing summer harvest tools, 60% of the labor force has been invested in field management.
    Various localities have also made comprehensive arrangements for various farm tasks in field management, organized specialized teams for checking seedlings and replanting, watering, topdressing, and weeding, replanting while fertilizing and weeding. In Huicheng County, people's communes have adopted measures such as transplanting and replanting seedlings, spot planting to fill gaps, replanting to preserve moisture, supplementary intercropping, supplementary plowing and planting, and supplementary fertilization according to local conditions. The number of first-class seedlings of spring-sown crops in the county is increasing day by day, and the number of third-class seedlings has greatly decreased.
    While comprehensively implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" responsibility system, all communes and teams have also universally promoted the "five fixings" small-scale contracting system of fixing quantity, fixing quality, fixing time, fixing labor, and fixing work points, and carried out labor competitions comparing awareness and attendance, comparing indicators and measures, comparing progress and quality, and comparing mutual assistance and cooperation.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Commune members in the Hexi Corridor and central regions of Gansu Province are carrying out a concentrated irrigation effort on spring wheat, peas and other crops in fields with crisscrossing canals and dotted reservoirs, ponds and wells, some having already been watered two or three times.
    This year, Gansu's spring-sown wheat fields and summer coarse grain areas are larger than in any previous year. These crops are mostly drought-resistant and planted in a race against time. In addition, field management is meticulous and fertilization is heavy, increasing water demand. Therefore, in field management, irrigation is given top priority. Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership over this work, implementing division of responsibility and guaranteeing early, extensive, and rapid irrigation. Wuwei County has organized more than 120 specialized irrigation teams to rush water day and night. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally goes deep into weak areas to implement planned water distribution, so that 80% of the irrigable area in the county is irrigated.
    Hefei, this newspaper, June 28th. The field management movement of spring-sown crops in various parts of Anhui Province has entered a new stage. At present, more than 10 million mu of early rice in the province has already returned to green and developed tillers, and some have already rounded their stems and closed the rows. Wuhu and Anqing prefectures along the Yangtze River are carrying out a production increase movement centered on topdressing and weeding according to the growth of rice seedlings; After the summer harvest is basically over, the Huaibei Plain immediately organizes forces to strengthen field management of high-yield crops such as spring rice, corn, and sweet potatoes. More than one million people throughout the province are mobilized every day to seize the time for topdressing and weeding, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest.
    Anhui Province has a large area of ​​spring-sown crops this year, which were sown early and managed carefully. Before the summer harvest and summer planting, various localities made labor use plans and fixed more than 50,000 specialized teams and dedicated personnel to manage spring-sown crops. After spring-sown crop seeds were planted, Anqing Prefecture mobilized 380,000 people every day to carry out field management. More than 2.7 million mu of early rice in the entire prefecture has been universally topdressed and weeded once, of which 40% has been topdressed and weeded twice. All localities have universally organized various specialized teams for checking, replanting, topdressing, weeding, and prevention for the spring cotton, corn, sweet potatoes and other crops that have emerged, linking them tightly and managing them to the end. After checking, Fuyang Prefecture found that there were a considerable number of crops missing seedlings and broken ridges. The entire prefecture immediately mobilized more than 300,000 people to carry seeds, seedlings, medicines, tools, and implements to replant, interplant, transplant, and spot replant, quickly filling and replenishing large areas of missing seedlings.
    In the process of topdressing and weeding, various localities have also particularly strengthened the management of mountain fields, remote fields, and barren fields, and widely carried out a mass movement of having mountain fields catch up with embankment fields, remote fields catch up with nearby fields, and barren fields catch up with fertile fields, promoting the universal classification of seedlings and striving for a large-scale balanced increase in production.

    集中劳力  抓紧时间  管好秋田
    甘肃力争在夏收前锄完秋田头遍草
    安徽出动大批劳动力管理春播作物
    据新华社讯　“小忙变大忙，及早管秋田”的生产热潮正在甘肃省各地迅速开展。
    天水、平凉、定西等早播地区均较往年提前十天给秋田作物锄草、追肥、浇水。河西走廊、临夏回族自治州等晚播地区，抢种和秋田管理同时并进。各地力争在夏收前，普遍给秋田锄完头遍草。
    甘肃省由于季节较晚，每年秋田管理和夏收夏种同时进行，夏季显得格外繁忙。今年小麦面积比去年扩大了5．2％，秋田播种也比去年增加。各级党委为了保证小麦丰产丰收，颗粒不丢和回茬复种，都提出了早行动，早动手，变当前的小忙为大忙，趁夏收前的间隙，及早大抓秋田管理。各地采取换、调、抽等办法挖掘劳动潜力。播种还在进行的地区，男女劳力合理分工，男劳力送粪、耙耱土地，女劳力锄草，并适当地抽出半劳力参加食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的劳动，换出全劳力参加田间生产。在春播基本结束的地区，除留一小部分劳动力继续抢墒扩种和准备夏收工具外，有60％的劳动力投入田间管理工作。
    对田间管理的各项农活，各地也作了全面安排，组织了查苗补苗、浇水、追肥、锄草专业队，边补边施肥，边锄草。徽成县各人民公社，因地制宜地采取移植补苗、点种补空、补墒保苗、补套种、补耕补种、补施肥料等办法，全县春播作物的一类苗逐日增加，三类苗大大下降。
    各社队在全面贯彻“三包一奖”责任制的同时，还普遍推行了定数量、定质量、定时间、定劳力、定工分的“五定”小包工制，开展了比觉悟看出勤，比指标看措施，比进度看质量，比互助看协作的劳动竞赛。
    据新华社讯　甘肃省河西走廊和中部地区各人民公社的社员，正在渠道纵横、库塘井泉星罗棋布的田野上，突击浇灌春麦、豌豆等作物，有的已浇过二至三次水。
    甘肃今年春播麦田和夏杂粮面积比过去任何一年都多，这些庄稼大都是抗旱抢种的，加之田间管理细致，施肥量多，需水量增加，因而在田间管理中，把灌水列为首要地位。各级党委都加强对这工作的领导，实行分片包干，进行早灌、多灌、快灌。武威县组织了一百二十多个灌溉专业队，日夜突击浇水。县委第一书记亲自深入薄弱地区，实行计划配水，使全县80％的应灌面积得到灌溉。
    本报合肥28日电　安徽省各地春播作物田间管理运动已进入新的阶段。目前，全省一千多万亩早稻已经返青发棵，有的已圆秆封行。沿江的芜湖、安庆两专区正根据禾苗生长情况，开展以追肥、耘草为中心的增产运动；淮北平原在夏收基本结束以后，立即组织力量加强对春稻、玉米、红芋等高产作物的田间管理。全省每天出动一百多万人抓紧追肥、锄草，力争全面丰收。
    安徽省今年春播作物面积大，种得早，管得细。在夏收夏种之前，各地就做好了劳力使用规划，固定了五万多个专业队、专人专班，管理春播作物。安庆专区在春播作物种子落地以后，每天就发动了三十八万人进行田间管理。全专区二百七十多万亩早稻已普遍追肥、耘草一次，其中有40％已追肥、耘草两次。各地对已出苗的春棉、玉米、红芋等作物，都普遍组织了查、补、追、锄、防等各种专业队，环环扣紧，一管到底。阜阳专区通过检查，发现有相当数量的缺苗断垅的作物以后，全专区立即发动了三十多万群众，携带种子、秧苗、药械、工具，进行重种、套种、移栽、点补，使大片缺苗面积，迅速补全补足。
    在追肥、锄草过程中，各地还特别加强对山田、远田、瘦田的管理，广泛开展山田赶畈田，远田赶近田，瘦田赶肥田的群众运动，促使禾苗普遍一类化，力争大面积平衡增产。（附图片）
