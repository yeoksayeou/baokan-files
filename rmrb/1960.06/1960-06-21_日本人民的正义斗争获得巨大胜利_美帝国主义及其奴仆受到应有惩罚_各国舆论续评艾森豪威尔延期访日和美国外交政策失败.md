Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 18th. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on June 18th, pointing out that the unprecedented failure of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan is the due result of the US ruling clique's aggressive actions.

The editorial said that the shameful failure of Eisenhower's visit to Japan has caused unprecedented panic and confusion within the Western ruling clique. In their panicked state, they openly admit that this is a failure of Washington's entire foreign policy.

The editorial said that now, they are reaping what they sowed. Aggressors are going from failure to failure, from bankruptcy to bankruptcy. They cannot stand on their feet in many countries around the world. The powerful chain reaction of anti-American actions is increasing day by day.

The American masters and their lackeys are getting the punishment they deserve.

The editorial, when talking about Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan, said that Eisenhower is visiting a "country" that does not exist at all. Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people's sovereignty over this territory must be restored.

The editorial, when talking about Eisenhower's visit to his South Korean colony, said that the Korean people have never been and will never be willing to let the United States continue to occupy South Korea. Here, as in Japan, people are shouting "Oppose Eisenhower's visit!" Now, the entire Far East is shouting this slogan. This is the result of Eisenhower's policy, the result of aggressive and barbaric policies that the people hate. Today, people all over the world see that this policy has gone bankrupt.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 19th. The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published an article today pointing out that the Japanese people, who are currently resolutely fighting against US imperialism, will surely achieve final victory.

The article said that the Japanese people's anti-American movement is caused by the brutal rule of US-Japanese militarism. This movement shows the will of the entire nation, which is in the midst of a struggle. The article pointed out that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East was mainly to visit Japan, and that Eisenhower being forced to postpone his "visit" to Japan was "a victory of great significance" for the Japanese people.

The article firmly believes that Japan's democratic forces will continue to fight for the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty, force Nobusuke Kishi to resign immediately, and dissolve the Diet.

The article said that after a more powerful and resolute struggle, "the heroic Japanese working class and people will surely win the final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 19th. "Rude Pravo" published a commentary today pointing out that the US-Japan new military treaty, which the Kishi Nobusuke government declared to be "naturally established," violates the will of the Japanese people. The Japanese people do not recognize it, and its "passage" is invalid.

The commentary, entitled "Invalid Passage," specifically mentioned the struggle launched by the Japanese people against the US-Japan military treaty. The commentary said that since the Japanese Diet discussed this treaty four weeks ago, a political earthquake has shaken Japan. It has not only shaken the foundation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, but also shaken all US bases in Japan.

The commentary said that the Japanese people will continue to fight, and they will not stop fighting as long as there is one American soldier on Japanese soil. The commentary pointed out that the "passage" of a treaty that the Japanese people will never recognize can never prevent the Japanese people from embarking on the path of getting rid of the US-Japan military treaty in the past, and they will persist in moving forward on this path.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 18th. The Press Trust of India reported that the people's comments heard everywhere here about Eisenhower being forced to cancel his trip to Japan were: This is "the biggest blow to the prestige of the United States in Asia." The news agency said that Indian officials "cautiously avoided" expressing a reaction.

The Tamil newspaper "Jana Sakti" published an editorial yesterday pointing out that Eisenhower being forced to cancel his visit to Japan is a victory for the Japanese people. The newspaper said that the Japanese people have given the American warmongers an unforgettable lesson, and they have prevented Eisenhower from going to their country. They told the Americans not to dream of using Japan as a front line for their war of aggression against the socialist camp. They have shown that the days when running dogs are in power are numbered.

A recent issue of the "Blitz" weekly said in an article, "The Dulles-Eisenhower policy toward Asia has collapsed like a house of cards in the past few weeks." "Blitz" said, "The United States has never suffered such a disastrous defeat in history as it is suffering in Asia today. In fact, it is an experience that no country has ever had in its diplomatic relations." It said, "The Americans made a huge bet. They lost."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, June 19th. The Lebanese newspaper "Al Nida" published a commentary today pointing out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's announcement that the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" was "naturally established" is against the will of the Japanese people.

The commentary said that Kishi Nobusuke did this "before he was forced to disappear from the political stage, before he ended his own political life and caught up with Syngman Rhee and Menderes, who were enemies of the people and loyal to imperialism, to complete his most dangerous service for his master, the American imperialists."

The commentary then asked, what is the value of a treaty opposed by the entire Japanese people?

The commentary pointed out that making this treaty "naturally established" will add fuel to the fire of the Japanese people's struggle. They will tear this treaty to pieces, and they will expel Kishi Nobusuke like the South Korean people expelled Syngman Rhee, and will cleanse the filth of American bases and spy planes on Japanese territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 19th. The Iraqi newspaper "Al Zaman" published an editorial today on the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle, saying that any victory achieved by the Japanese people will be an effective contribution to the cause of the Asian and African people and Asian-African solidarity. The editorial said that Eisenhower's postponement of his visit to Japan is a serious blow to the reputation of the United States and the West in Asia. The editorial said that the Japanese people believe that the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" is a tool to subject Japan to the dangers of war. Therefore, they are fighting to abolish this treaty.

    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联“真理报”18日发表社论指出，艾森豪威尔“访问”日本所遭到的史无前例的失败，是美国统治集团侵略行动的应有结果。
    社论说，艾森豪威尔访问日本的可耻失败，引起了西方统治集团内部的空前惊惶和混乱。它们在惊惶状态中公开承认，这是华盛顿整个外交政策的失败。
    社论说，现在，他们自食其果了。侵略者从失败走向失败，从破产走到破产。在世界许多国家，他们都站不住脚。反美行动的强大的链锁反应日益加强。
    美国主子及其奴仆正得到应有的惩罚。
    社论在谈到艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾时说，艾森豪威尔是到根本不存在的“国家”去作客。台湾是中华人民共和国的不可分割的一部分。中国人民对这块领土的主权是一定要恢复的。
    社论谈到艾森豪威尔到他的南朝鲜殖民地进行访问时说，朝鲜人民过去和将来都绝不甘心让美国继续占领南朝鲜。这里同日本一样，也高呼“反对艾森豪威尔访问！”现在，整个远东都喊着这个口号。这是艾森豪威尔政策的结果，是人民所仇视的侵略和蛮横政策的结果。今天，全世界人民都看到，这个政策破产了。
    越南“人民报”说日本人民反美运动显示了整个民族的意愿
    新华社河内19日电　越南“人民报”今天发表文章指出，目前正在坚决进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的日本人民，必将获得最后的胜利。

    文章坚信，日本的民主力量将继续斗争，争取取消日美军事同盟条约，迫使岸信介立即辞职，解散国会。
    文章说，经过更加有力和坚决的斗争，“英雄的日本工人阶级和人民一定会赢得最后胜利。”
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”说日本的政治地震动摇了美国的基地
    新华社布拉格19日电　“红色权利报”今天发表评论指出，岸信介政府宣布“自然成立”的日美新军事条约违反日本人民的意愿，日本人民不承认它，它的“通过”是无效的。
    这篇题为“无效的通过”的评论特别谈到日本人民所掀起的反对日美军事条约的斗争。评论说，从四个星期前日本国会讨论这个条约时起，政治地震就震撼着日本，它不仅动摇了岸信介政府的基础，而且动摇了美国在日本的所有基地。
    评论说，日本人民将继续进行斗争，只要在日本国土上还有一个美国兵，他们就一天不停止斗争。评论指出，为日本人民所永远不会承认的条约的“通过”，决不能阻止在过去的日子里日本人民所走上的摆脱美日军事条约的道路，他们将在这条道路上坚持前进。
    印度“人民力量”报说日本人民已给美国战争贩子一个难忘教训
    据新华社新德里18日电　印度新闻社报道，在这里各处听到的人民对艾森豪威尔被迫取消日本之行的评语是：这是“美国在亚洲的威信所受到的最大打击”。这家通讯社说，印度官方“谨慎地避免”表示反应。
    泰米尔文“人民力量”报昨天发表社论指出，艾森豪威尔被迫取消访问日本是日本人民的胜利。这家报纸说，日本人民已经给美国战争贩子一个不能忘掉的教训，他们阻止了艾森豪威尔到他们的国家去。他们对美国人说，美国人不要梦想用日本作为他们对社会主义阵营发动的侵略战争的前线。他们已经显示，走狗们掌权的日子已经屈指可数了。
    最近一期“闪电”周报在一篇文章中说，“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔对亚洲的政策在过去几周内像纸糊的房子一样地垮了。”“闪电”周报说，“美国在历史上从来没有遭到像它今天在亚洲所遭到的惨败。事实上那是任何国家的外交关系上从来没有过的经历。”它说，“美国人下了巨大的赌注。他们输了。”
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”说日美条约“自然成立”将给日本人民斗争火上加油
    新华社贝鲁特19日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表评论指出，岸信介政府宣布新日美“安全条约”的“自然成立”，是违反日本人民的意志的。
    评论说，岸信介这样做，“是在他被迫从政治舞台上消失以前，在结束他自己的政治生活和追上与人民为敌、为帝国主义效忠的李承晚和曼德列斯以前，为他的主子美帝国主义者完成他的最危险的效劳。”
    评论接着问道，为全体日本人民所反对的条约有什么价值呢？
    评论指出，使这项条约“自然成立”这件事将给日本人民的斗争火上加油，他们将把这项条约撕成粉碎，将会像南朝鲜人民驱逐李承晚一样驱逐岸信介，并且会清洗日本领土上的美国基地和间谍飞机的污秽。
    伊拉克“时代报”说日本人民的胜利是对亚非人民事业的贡献
    据新华社巴格达19日电　伊拉克“时代报”今天就日本人民的反美反岸爱国斗争发表社论说，日本人民所取得的任何胜利，都将是对亚非人民的事业和亚非团结的有效贡献。社论说，艾森豪威尔推迟访问日本这件事是对美国和西方在亚洲的名声的严重打击。社论说，日本人民认为，新日美“安全条约”是一种要使日本遭受战争危害的工具。因此，他们正在为取消这项条约而进行斗争。
