Xinhua News Agency, 18th: U.S. imperialism is dispatching vessels and aircraft of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which occupies Taiwan and threatens our country and Asian security, and is now engaging in rampant activities in the Taiwan Strait and its vicinity, coordinating with Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan. This is a U.S. imperialist delusion to use the long-bankrupt "gunboat policy" to carry out armed intimidation against the Chinese people, who extremely despise and scorn the American bandits.

According to the United States Information Service, Eisenhower, en route to Taiwan on the 17th, hid in the room of the Seventh Fleet flagship, the "St. Paul," to "address" the officers and men of the Seventh Fleet via radio. This chieftain of the American aggressor group clamored that "the Seventh Fleet must be strong enough to support our allies (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) and safeguard our (U.S.) interests." Eisenhower's shameless howling, in addition to once again exposing the bandit face of the United States, cannot conceal his panic in the embarrassing situation of being "a rat running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone." The British "Daily Express" wrote on the 18th, "Eisenhower is still terrified by the huge diplomatic blow caused by the cancellation of the Tokyo trip, and he is traveling to (Taiwan) on a warship under the strictest possible security."

According to a United Press International report filed on the 17th from the Seventh Fleet aircraft carrier "Yorktown," U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Charles Griffin clamored on the "Yorktown" that the pirate fleet under his command "is always on alert." He also shamelessly threatened, "If the Chinese Communists want to do something, we are ready." The UPI report said that the Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers "Ticonderoga," "Yorktown," "Ranger," missile cruiser "Canberra," and many submarines and destroyers were all sailing near Taiwan and its adjacent waters under the pretext of "escorting" the heavy cruiser "St. Paul," on which Eisenhower was traveling. Combat aircraft taking off from American aircraft carriers are also constantly patrolling the skies over this area. According to Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group's "Central News Agency" on the 18th, the U.S. Seventh Fleet now has at least four aircraft carriers anchored in the waters off Taiwan and is "ordered to be on alert and well prepared (for combat)."

According to a UPI Taipei report on the 17th, the U.S. aggressor troops stationed in Taiwan are now "on alert" under a plan drafted weeks ago. The Taipei report also said that under the instigation of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan and the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, the Chiang Kai-shek Navy began a week-long large-scale "amphibious landing exercise" in southern Taiwan on the 17th. With the cooperation of the Chiang army's air force, about one hundred ships of various types supplied to the Chiang army by the United States participated in this provocative exercise.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Taipei dispatch: Eisenhower, who came to Asia to spread war germs, rolled away from Taiwan to Okinawa this morning amidst the roar of ten thousand cannons of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops chasing away the plague god.

He left Taipei's Songshan Airport by plane at around 10:30 a.m. local time.

It was reported that Eisenhower delivered a speech at the airport before his departure, reiterating the U.S. government's policy of resolutely being hostile to the Chinese people. He shamelessly described the situation in Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States, where the economy is declining, hunger and poverty prevail, and the people are in dire straits, as a "living proof of a good life," and maliciously provoked the Chinese people, saying that "such a beacon of hope will accelerate the dawn of freedom for themselves (the Chinese people on the mainland)."

Eisenhower once again cheered up the American lackeys, saying: "Let me once again assure you (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) that your important role in our joint efforts to achieve a world of justice and peace in freedom" receives the "full and unwavering support" of the U.S. government.

Eisenhower also slandered the Chinese people at a banquet last night and nakedly stated that the U.S. government was deliberately trying to overthrow the Chinese government. He once again uttered the infamous ravings of the late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, cursing the Chinese people's great socialist cause as "a temporary rather than a permanent phenomenon."

Eisenhower continued to hold two talks with Chiang Kai-shek this morning. One of them was held secretly at the airport. It was reported that this meeting delayed the plane's take-off by twelve minutes. The two sides issued a communiqué on the results of the talks, but the communiqué did not reveal any specific issues discussed.

    妄图对我国人民进行武装恫吓
    美国海空军在台湾海峡猖狂活动
    艾森豪威尔在离台前重申美国敌视中国政策
    新华社18日讯　美帝国主义派遣霸占台湾、威胁我国和亚洲安全的美国第七舰队舰艇和飞机，现在正在配合艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾，在台湾海峡及其附近地区的海面和空中猖狂活动。这是美帝国主义妄想用早已破产的“炮舰政策”，来对极端蔑视和鄙视美国强盗的我国人民进行武装恫吓。
    据美国新闻处消息，艾森豪威尔17日在去台湾的途中，曾躲在第七舰队的旗舰“圣保罗号”的房间通过广播对第七舰队的官兵“训话”，这个美国侵略集团的强盗头子叫嚷说，“第七舰队必须强大到足以支持我们的盟国（此处指蒋介石集团），维护我们（美国）的利益”。艾森豪威尔的无耻嘶喊除了再一次暴露了美国的强盗面目以外，并不能掩盖他在“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的狼狈处境下的惊慌。英国“每日快报”18日写道，“艾森豪威尔对取消东京之行所造成的巨大的外交打击仍然胆战心惊，他是在能够做到的最严密的戒备下乘军舰前往（台湾）的”。
    据美国合众国际社记者17日从第七舰队航空母舰“约克城号”发出的消息，美国第七舰队司令查尔斯·格里芬在“约克城号”上叫嚣说，他指挥的这支海盗船队“随时保持着戒备”。他还无耻地恫吓说，“如果中共想搞点什么，我们是准备着的”。合众国际社的这则消息说，第七舰队的航空母舰“提康德罗加号”、“约克城号”、“徘徊者号”、导弹巡洋舰“坎培拉号”和许多艘潜水艇、驱逐舰等，都在“护送”艾森豪威尔乘座的重巡洋舰“圣保罗号”的借口下，驶近台湾及其附近地区的海面活动，从美国航空母舰上起飞的作战飞机，也不断在这一地区的上空巡逻。另据台湾蒋介石集团“中央社”18日消息，美国第七舰队现在至少有四艘航空母舰停泊在台湾海面，并且“奉命戒备，有很好的（作战）准备。”
    另据合众国际社17日台北消息，根据数周前拟订的计划，驻在台湾的美国侵略军现在“已经处于戒备状态”。台北消息还说，在美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团和侵台美军司令部的指使下，蒋介石海军17日起在台湾南部举行连续一星期的大规模“两栖登陆演习”，在蒋军空军配合下，大约一百艘各种类型由美国供给蒋军的舰艇参加这次挑衅性演习。
    新华社19日讯　台北消息：到亚洲散布战争细菌的艾森豪威尔今天上午在中国人民解放军福建前线部队万炮齐发逐瘟神的怒吼声中滚离台湾前往冲绳。
    他在上午当地时间十时半左右乘飞机离开台北松山机场。
    据报道，艾森豪威尔动身前在机场发表了一个讲话，重申美国政府坚决与中国人民为敌的政策。他恬不知耻地把在美国霸占下经济雕蔽、饥饿穷困、人民处于水深火热的台湾景况说成是“美好生活的活生生的证明”，并且向中国人民进行恶意地挑衅，说什么“这样一个希望的灯塔将加速他们自己（大陆上的中国人民）的自由的黎明的到来”。
    艾森豪威尔再次为美国的奴才打气，说：“让我再一次向你们（指蒋介石集团）保证，你们在我们为实现一个有着自由中的正义的和平的世界而作的共同努力中所起的重要作用”是得到美国政府的“充分和毫不动摇的支持的”。
    艾森豪威尔昨天晚上在一次宴会上也大肆诽谤中国人民，并且赤裸裸地表明美国政府处心积虑要推翻中国政府。他再次发出臭名远扬的美国已故国务卿杜勒斯的呓语，咀咒中国人民伟大的社会主义事业是“一种一时的而不是永久的现象”。
    艾森豪威尔在今天上午继续同蒋介石举行了两次会谈。其中的一次是在机场秘密举行的，据报道，这次会谈使得飞机起飞的时间推迟了十二分钟。双方就会谈结果发表了一个公报，但是这个公报没有透露会谈的任何具体问题。
