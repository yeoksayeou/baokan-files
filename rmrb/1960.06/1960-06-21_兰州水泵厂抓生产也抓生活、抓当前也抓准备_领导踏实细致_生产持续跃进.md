    Lanzhou, June 20th (This Newspaper) – The Lanzhou Water Pump Factory used the method of "grasping with both hands" to ensure a continuous leap forward and a substantial increase in production.

    This year, the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory has exceeded the state plan every month. In January, it exceeded the plan by 5% eleven days ahead of schedule, in February it exceeded the plan by 4.7% four days ahead of schedule, in March it exceeded the plan by 0.7%, in April it exceeded the plan by 11.8% five days ahead of schedule, and in May it exceeded the plan by 13.9% three days ahead of schedule.

    The reason why the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory has been able to ensure a continuous leap forward in production is mainly due to the use of the "grasping with both hands" method. In general terms, this means grasping production with one hand and life with the other. In terms of production, this means grasping current production with one hand and preparing for the next stage with the other. In terms of current production, this means grasping the issuance of plans with one hand and inspection and evaluation with the other. In terms of preparation for the next stage, this means grasping the supply of raw materials with one hand and accepting orders from other units with the other. In terms of time steps, emphasis is placed on grasping production in the first and middle ten days of the month, and emphasis is placed on grasping preparation in the last ten days of the month. The factory's Party committee frequently convenes meetings on production issues. Leaders at all levels, from the factory headquarters to workshops, sections, and teams, have specific divisions of labor, with one person specifically grasping current production and another grasping preparation for the next stage.

    When the factory conducts "two-handed" production, it first solves the problem of some employees believing that "the situation of being relaxed at the beginning and then tight at the end cannot be overcome" by emphasizing dialectics and the principle that continuous leap forward is a revolutionary routine. At the same time, it grasps the arrangement of plans and issues them as early as possible. The production plans for January to May were issued to the workshops about ten days ahead of schedule. With plans issued early, there is more time to prepare for production. When the plans begin to be implemented, it also grasps inspection and evaluation, announcing the production situation every day to encourage the workers' enthusiasm for labor. While grasping the plans, it also grasps the supply of raw materials. Starting at the end of last year, it strengthened ideological education for supply and marketing personnel, thereby ensuring the timely supply of the three major materials in the first half of the year. Currently, they are grasping the preparations for the third quarter, and they have made sufficient preparations for the raw materials for production in July.

    While grasping production with one hand, the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory also grasps the lives of its employees, achieving a balance between work and rest. On the basis of the factory's great development in production, it has vigorously promoted the technical and cultural education of its employees. The vast majority of employees who should be enrolled have participated in cultural and technical studies, and various recreational and sports activities have been carried out. Now, the factory has basically eliminated the phenomenon of working overtime.

    兰州水泵厂抓生产也抓生活、抓当前也抓准备
    领导踏实细致　生产持续跃进
    本报兰州20日电　兰州水泵厂运用“两手抓”的办法，保证了生产持续跃进和大幅度增长。
    今年来，兰州水泵厂月月超额完成了国家计划，1月份提前十一天超额5％、2月份提前四天超额4．7％、3月份超额0．7％、4月份提前五天超额11．8％，5月份提前三天超额13．9％。
    兰州水泵厂所以能够保证生产持续跃进，主要是运用了“两手抓”的办法。从总的方面来讲，即一手抓生产，一手抓生活。从生产上来讲，即一手抓当前生产，一手抓下阶段准备；从当前生产来讲，即一手抓计划下达，一手抓检查评比；从下阶段准备来讲，一手抓原材料供应，一手抓承接外单位订货；从时间步骤上来讲，上、中旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备。这个厂的党委经常召开有关生产问题的会议，从厂部到车间、工段、小组各级领导，都有具体分工，一人专门抓当前生产，一人抓下阶段准备。
    这个厂在生产上进行两手抓的时候，首先解决部分职工认为“前松后紧无法克服”的思想，大讲辩证法，大讲持续跃进是革命常规的道理。同时抓紧计划的安排和及早下达，元月至5月份的生产计划都先后提前十天左右下达到车间。计划下达得早，就有比较充裕的时间做生产准备工作。在计划开始执行的时候，又抓紧检查评比，每天公布生产情况，鼓舞职工的劳动热情。在抓计划的同时，还抓原材料供应。从去年年底起，就加强了对供销人员的思想教育，从而保证了上半年三大材料的及时供应。目前他们正抓紧三季度的准备工作，7月份生产的原料材料，已经有了较充分的准备。
    兰州水泵厂在一手抓生产的同时，一手抓职工生活，做到了有劳有逸，劳逸结合。这个厂在生产大发展的基础上，大搞职工的技术文化教育，全厂绝大多数应该入学的职工都参加了文化技术学习，开展了各种文娱体育活动。现在这个厂已经基本消灭了加班加点现象。
