Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today issued a statement regarding the Kishi Nobusuke government's secret exchange of ratification documents for the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the United States and Kishi Nobusuke's statement of resignation.

    The statement emphasized: "The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet should resign immediately. We will not be deceived by the compromise measures that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are attempting to take. We guarantee that we will fight for the immediate overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet."

    The statement said: "Although Kishi Nobusuke finally said this morning that he would resign, he once again avoided specifying the definite date of his cabinet's resignation, apparently attempting to prepare the next reactionary government to take over his policy of protecting big businesses before he resigns."

    The statement said: "We cannot tolerate the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's attitude of disregarding the Japanese people's demands for peace, democracy, and improved living standards. We will also resolutely oppose any attempt by any of those politicians who have dirtied their hands in the dirty deal of forcibly passing the Security Treaty to replace Kishi Nobusuke as Prime Minister."

    日本总评发表声明
    不许反动政客代替岸信介执政
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天就岸信介政府同美国偷偷交换新日美“安全条约”批准书和岸信介的辞职声明发表了声明。
    声明强调说：“岸信介内阁应该立即辞职。我们决不会受岸信介内阁和自由民主党企图采取的妥协措施的欺骗。我们保证我们将为立即推翻岸信介内阁和解散国会而斗争。”
    声明说：“虽然岸信介今天上午最后说他将辞职，但是他再一次避免说明他的内阁辞职的肯定日期，显然是企图准备下一届反动政府在他辞职之前接收他的保护大企业的政策。”
    声明说：“我们不能容忍岸信介内阁的这种无视日本人民争取和平、民主和改善生活的要求的态度。我们还将坚决地反对任何那些在强行通过安全条约的肮脏勾当中染污了双手的政客之一来代替岸信介执政的企图。”
