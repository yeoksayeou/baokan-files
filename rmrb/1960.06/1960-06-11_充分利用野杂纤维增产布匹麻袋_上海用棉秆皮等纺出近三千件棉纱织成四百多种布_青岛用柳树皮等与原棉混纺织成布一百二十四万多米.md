Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: Shanghai's textile industry departments have used more than 70 kinds of wild fibers such as ramie, cotton stalk bark, *Imperata cylindrica*, and broad bean stalks to spin nearly 3,000 bales of cotton yarn and trial-produce 408 kinds of fabrics for various purposes.

The effect of Shanghai's textile departments' trial spinning with wild plant fibers proves that although the properties of these wild plant fibers are different, as long as technical measures are strengthened, very good textiles can be woven. The twill overcoating fabric woven by State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 with a blend of wild fibers and cotton fibers is durable, stiff, and elegant for making coats and children's overcoats. The printed plain cloth and figured cloth woven by Yong'an No. 1 Factory and other factories with a blend of wild fibers are very suitable for making curtains and tablecloths.

In order to adapt to the needs of spinning wild fibers, many factories have reformed spinning and weaving machines. Some factories have also connected degumming, rinsing, and cutting processes into an assembly line so that wild fibers can be put into production as quickly and in large quantities as possible. In just over ten days, the staff and workers of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 9 refined 58 kinds of wild fibers and produced 66 different products. In just over ten days, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 also spun 19 kinds of yarn counts ranging from 3 to 36 from various wild fibers and wove more than 20 kinds of fabrics for different purposes. This factory also used wild fibers to spin high-count yarn and weave jacquard fabrics.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao: Under the slogan of "Breaking out of the cotton circle," Qingdao's textile industry is actively using wild fibers and miscellaneous fibers mixed with raw cotton for spinning and weaving.

From January to the first half of May this year, textile factories throughout the city used more than 20 kinds of wild plant fibers such as *Gymnema* bark, flax, birch bark, and willow bark mixed with raw cotton to spin more than 4,800 bales of yarn, weaving more than 1,246,000 meters of packaging cloth, canvas, twill, plain cloth, printed cloth, herringbone fabrics and other industrial and clothing fabrics. Due to the use of wild and miscellaneous fibers, a total of more than 380,000 kilograms of raw cotton were saved in the first four and a half months of this year. Various factories also mixed 50% cotton stalk bark into jute to weave more than 131,000 gunny sacks, saving about 60,000 kilograms of jute.

The blending ratio of wild fibers and the fineness of the spun yarn are gradually increasing in various places. At the beginning, only about 20% of wild and miscellaneous fibers could be mixed per 100 kilograms of raw cotton, but later it gradually increased to 25% to 60%. The fineness of the yarn has also increased from about 10 counts at the beginning to 21 counts now.

    充分利用野杂纤维增产布匹麻袋
    上海用棉秆皮等纺出近三千件棉纱织成四百多种布
    青岛用柳树皮等与原棉混纺织成布一百二十四万多米
    据新华社上海电　上海纺织工业部门用红野麻、棉秆皮、龙须草、蚕豆秆等七十多种野杂纤维，纺出了近三千件棉纱，试织出各种用途的布四百零八种。
    上海纺织部门用野生植物纤维试纺的效果证明，这些野生植物纤维的性能虽然各有不同，但是，只要加强技术措施，都可以织出很好的纺织品。国棉二厂用野生纤维和棉纤维混纺织出的人字大衣呢，用来做外套和小孩大衣，耐磨、挺硬，而且大方；永安一厂等厂用野生纤维混纺织出的印花平纹布、提花布，用来做窗帘、台布都很合适。
    为了适应纺织野生纤维的需要，许多厂都改革了纺机和织机。有些工厂还把脱胶、冲洗、切断等工序连成一条流水线，使野生纤维尽快大量地投入生产。国棉九厂职工在短短的十多天里，就炼制了各种野生纤维五十八种，制成了六十六种不同的产品；国棉一厂也在十多天的时间里，用各种野生纤维纺成了三支到三十六支等不同的十九种纱支，并且织成了二十多种不同用途的布。这个厂还用野杂纤维纺成高支纱，织成提花织物。
    据新华社青岛电　青岛市纺织工业在“跳出棉花圈子”的口号下，积极利用野生纤维和杂类纤维与原棉混合纺纱织布。
    今年1月到5月上半月，全市各纺织厂利用了胶藤皮、胡麻、桦香皮、柳树皮等二十多种野生植物纤维与原棉混纺，共纺出纱四千八百多件，织成了一百二十四万六千多米包装布、帆布、斜纹布、平布、花布及人字呢等多种工业、衣著用布。由于使用野杂纤维，今年前四个半月共节约了三十八万多公斤原棉。各厂还在黄麻里掺50％的棉秆皮织出十三万一千多条麻袋，节约黄麻约六万公斤。
    各地利用野生纤维的混纺比例和纺出纱的细度逐步提高。开始时，每百斤原棉只能掺20％左右的野杂纤维，后来逐渐增加到25％到60％；纱的细度也由起初时的十支左右，现在提高到二十一支了。
