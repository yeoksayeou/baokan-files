Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram today to Li Hyo-soon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, on the 10th anniversary of the US imperialists' launch of the Korean War on June 25th, stating that the 650 million Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's just and patriotic struggle against the United States. The telegram said: "We firmly believe that this heroic struggle of the Korean people, with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, will surely achieve final victory."

Liu Ningyi's telegram pointed out that although the American bandits were forced to sign the armistice agreement, "US imperialism still occupies South Korea, refusing to leave, constantly carrying out military provocations, and wantonly destroying the armistice agreement. This fully demonstrates that the bellicose and aggressive nature of US imperialism has not changed at all."

The telegram said: "The trip to Asia and South Korea by the head of US imperialism and plague god Eisenhower once again nakedly exposed that US imperialism is the pillar of the most reactionary and decadent forces in Asian countries and South Korea, and the most ferocious enemy of the people in Asia and the world."

Liu Ningyi said in the telegram: "We are pleased to see that the Korean people have launched a surging anti-American struggle. The South Korean people have overthrown the US puppet Syngman Rhee and are waging a persistent struggle against the US new puppet Huh Chung's reactionary group, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea. The 650 million Chinese people vow to be the backing of the Korean people and firmly support the Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. We firmly believe that this heroic struggle of the Korean people, with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, will surely achieve final victory.

"The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the Korean people's cause of striving for the reunification of their motherland and have made sincere efforts for this. In October 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to completely withdraw from North Korea, creating favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, due to the consistent obstruction and sabotage by US imperialism, the Korean people's national desire for peaceful reunification has not yet been realized. The Chinese people fully support the reasonable proposals and propositions put forward by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and your government on several occasions regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea, and firmly believe that the great cause of the Korean people's reunification of their motherland will surely be victoriously completed.

"China and North Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and share weal and woe. The people of the two countries are as close as brothers and sisters and share a common destiny. Our friendship is forged in blood and is unbreakable. The Chinese people will always stand closely with the Korean people and are ready at all times to smash the attacks of US imperialism together with the Korean people.

"May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people last forever!"

Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China , the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation, on the occasion of the upcoming tenth anniversary of the US imperialist launch of the war of aggression against Korea, sent telegrams to the Korean Democratic Youth League and the Korean Student Committee, representing all Chinese youth and students to express their high respect to the Korean youth and students who have persisted in the heroic struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and expressed firm support for the just struggle of the Korean people.

The telegram said: US imperialism suffered a shameful defeat in the Korean War, but its aggressive nature has not changed. A wolf is always a wolf. At present, US imperialism continues to occupy South Korea, continues to enslave the people of Japan, the Philippines, Turkey and other countries, continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and obstructs the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The telegram said that US imperialism has done all kinds of bad things, and the people will not forgive it. US imperialism must get out of South Korea, get out of our territory Taiwan, get out of Japan, and get out of Asia.

The telegram said that we Chinese youth and students will unite closely with our brotherly Korean youth and students to wage a resolute struggle against our common enemy, US imperialism. We firmly believe that, with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, the Korean people and youth and students' just struggle against US imperialist occupation of South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland will surely win final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the US imperialist launch of the war of aggression against Korea, the All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, expressing the highest respect to the Korean brothers and sisters who heroically defeated the US imperialist aggression and made immortal contributions to defending peace in the Far East and the world.

The telegram said, "The war of aggression against Korea launched by the heinous US imperialism ten years ago ended with the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people and the heavy defeat of US imperialism under the valiant and tenacious fight of the people of North Korea and China fighting side by side, making the people all over the world can clearly see that the seemingly powerful US imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, thus greatly encouraging the determination and confidence of the Asian people and the people of the world in the anti-US struggle.

"Now the storm against US imperialism and its running dogs is rising like a raging fire in Asia and around the world. The struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, Turkey and other countries have opened up a new battlefield against US imperialism and its running dogs. The "plague god" Eisenhower's thieving trip to the Far East has been badly defeated, all of which shows that the life of US imperialism is indeed not long.

"The people of China and North Korea have personally suffered the most barbaric massacres and plunder by US imperialism, and the devastation and trampling on women and children is even more severe. We must always remember this blood debt. US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of China and North Korea and the people of the world. The friendship between the people of China and North Korea forged in blood is unbreakable. The Chinese people and women resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and resolutely support the South Korean people's anti-American patriotic just struggle. We firmly believe that the Korean people will surely be able to drive US imperialism out of South Korea, and final victory belongs to the Korean people."

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the US imperialist launch of the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent telegrams to the Korean National Committee for the Support of Peace and the Korean Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and forwarded them to the Pyongyang Rally to Condemn US Imperialist Aggression against Korea and Demand the Immediate Withdrawal of US Imperialist Aggression Troops, warmly congratulating the convening of the rally, and through the rally to the Korean people standing on the front line of opposing US imperialist aggression and defending world peace, and Korean people's leader Premier Kim Il-sung, expressing the most lofty respect.

The telegram said that the glorious victory achieved by the heroic Korean people in the just war against US imperialist aggression and defending the independence and freedom of their motherland has made brilliant contributions to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. After Korean armistice, the Korean people have consistently abided by the armistice agreement and made unremitting efforts to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, which has been welcomed and supported by the people all over the world. The Korean people's demand that US aggression troops withdraw from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland not only conforms to the interests of the Korean nation, but is also the common aspiration of the people of Asia and the world. However, US imperialism wantonly sabotages the armistice agreement, continues to occupy South Korea, and turns South Korea into a base for launching new wars of aggression, seriously threatening peace in the Far East, once again thoroughly exposing the bellicose and aggressive nature of US imperialism. The Chinese people resolutely support the Korean people's just and patriotic struggle demanding the withdrawal of US aggression troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and strongly condemn and resolutely oppose US imperialism's policy of aggression and war. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean people's great cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and building socialism will surely achieve new and more brilliant achievements.

The telegram said that the friendship between the people of China and North Korea is an important guarantee for maintaining peace in Asia. The Chinese people heartily congratulate the fighting friendship between the people of China and North Korea, forged in blood, which will become even more consolidated and developed in the common cause of opposing US imperialism, defending peace, and building socialism. Let our two peoples of China and North Korea unite more closely, unite Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all forces in the world striving for national independence and defending world peace, and carry out the just struggle against the US-led imperialist forces of aggression and war and defending world peace to a complete victory.

    全国总工会、团中央和妇联等分别致电朝鲜各人民团体
    中国支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争
    朝鲜人民一定能把美国强盗赶出南朝鲜
    新华社23日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天就6月25日美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争十周年，打电报给朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳说，六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民的反美爱国正义斗争。电报说：“我们深信，朝鲜人民的这一英勇斗争在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和世界一切爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会获得最后胜利。”
    刘宁一的电报指出，美国强盗虽然被迫在停战协定上签了字，“但美帝国主义迄今仍霸占着南朝鲜，赖着不走，不断地进行军事挑衅，肆意破坏停战协定。这充分表明美帝国主义好战的侵略本性丝毫没有改变。”
    电报说：“美帝国主义头子、瘟神艾森豪威尔的亚洲和南朝鲜之行，再一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义是亚洲各国和南朝鲜最反动、最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。”
    刘宁一在电报中说：“我们高兴地看到，朝鲜人民掀起了风起云涌的反美斗争。南朝鲜人民已把美国的傀儡李承晚赶下了台，并正为反对美国的新傀儡许政反动集团、要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜而进行坚持不懈的斗争。六亿五千万中国人民誓为朝鲜人民的后盾，坚决支持朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。我们深信，朝鲜人民的这一英勇斗争在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和世界一切爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会获得最后胜利。
    “中国人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国统一的事业，并为此作出了真诚的努力。1958年10月，中国人民志愿军主动地全部撤出了朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的和平解决创造了有利的条件。但是由于美帝国主义的一贯阻挠和破坏，朝鲜人民要求和平统一的民族愿望，至今未能实现。中国人民完全支持朝鲜劳动党中央和贵国政时历次提出的有关和平统一朝鲜的合理建议和主张，并坚信朝鲜人民统一祖国的伟业必将胜利完成。
    “中朝两国唇齿相依，安危与共。两国人民亲如手足，休戚相关。我们的友谊是用鲜血凝成的，是牢不可破的。中国人民将永远和朝鲜人民紧密地站在一起，时刻准备着同朝鲜人民一道粉碎美帝国主义的进攻。
      “祝中朝两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万古长青！”
    新华社23日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会，在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争十周年将要到来的时候，致电朝鲜民主青年同盟和朝鲜学生委员会，代表全中国青年和学生向为反对美帝国主义侵略、争取祖国和平统一而坚持英勇斗争的朝鲜青年和学生致以崇高的敬意，并表示坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    电报说：美帝国主义在侵朝战争中遭到了可耻的惨败，但是它的侵略本性并没有改变。狼终究还是狼。目前美帝国主义继续霸占南朝鲜，继续奴役日本、菲律宾、土耳其等国人民，继续侵占我国领土台湾，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。
    电报说，美帝国主义做尽了坏事，人民不会饶恕它。美帝国主义必须从南朝鲜滚出去，从我国领土台湾滚出去，从日本滚出去，从亚洲滚出去。
    电报说，我们中国青年、学生将同兄弟的朝鲜青年、学生紧密地团结在一起，为反对我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义而进行坚决的斗争。我们深信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的有力支持下，朝鲜人民和青年、学生反对美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜和争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，必将获得最后的胜利。
    新华社23日讯　全国妇女联合会在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争十周年前夕，致电朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会，向英勇击败美帝国主义侵略为保卫远东与世界和平树立了不朽功勋的朝鲜兄弟姐妹们表示最崇高的敬意。
    电报说，“十年前万恶的美帝国主义所发动的侵朝战争，在朝中两国人民并肩作战，英勇顽强地打击下，以朝中人民的伟大胜利和美帝国主义的惨重失败而告终，使全世界人民可以清楚地看到，貌似强大的美帝国主义，不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎，从而大大地鼓舞了亚洲人民和世界人民反美斗争的决心和信心。
      “现在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的风暴正在亚洲和世界各地如火如荼地兴起。南朝鲜、日本、土耳其等国人民的斗争又开辟了一条反对美帝国主义及其走狗的新战场。“瘟神”艾森豪威尔远东的强盗旅行已遭到惨败，这些都表明美帝国主义的寿命的确不长了。
    “中朝两国人民都亲身遭受到美帝国主义最野蛮的屠杀和掠夺，妇女和儿童受到的摧残和蹂躏更为惨重，这笔血债我们是永远要记住的。美帝国主义是中朝人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，中朝人民用鲜血结成的友谊是牢不可破的，中国人民和妇女坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略、和平统一祖国的正义斗争，坚决支持南朝鲜人民反美爱国的正义斗争。我们深信，朝鲜人民一定能够把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，最后胜利是属于朝鲜人民的。”
    新华社24日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争十周年前夕，致电朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会、朝鲜亚非团结委员会并转平壤市谴责美帝侵略朝鲜、要求立即撤出美帝侵略军大会，热烈祝贺大会的召开，并通过大会向站在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平最前线的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民的领袖金日成首相致以最崇高的敬意。
    电报说，英勇的朝鲜人民，在反抗美帝国主义侵略、保卫祖国独立自由的正义战争中所取得的光辉胜利，对保卫远东和世界和平事业，作出了辉煌的贡献。朝鲜停战后，朝鲜人民一贯遵守停战协定，并为实现朝鲜的和平统一作了不懈的努力，受到全世界人民的欢迎和支持。朝鲜人民要求美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜和实现祖国和平统一，不仅符合朝鲜民族的利益，而且也是亚洲和全世界人民的共同愿望。但是，美帝国主义肆意破坏停战协定，继续霸占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成发动新的侵略战争基地，严重威胁着远东和平，再一次彻底暴露了美帝国主义的好战侵略本性。中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜和实现祖国和平统一的正义爱国斗争，严厉谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策。我们深信，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一和建设社会主义的伟大事业，一定能够取得新的更辉煌的成就。
    电报说，中朝两国人民的友谊是维护亚洲和平的重要保证。中国人民衷心祝贺中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，在反对美帝国主义、保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同事业中更加日益巩固和发展。让我们中朝两国人民更加紧密团结起来，联合亚、非、拉丁美洲及全世界一切争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的力量，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略战争势力和保卫世界和平的正义斗争进行到彻底的胜利。
