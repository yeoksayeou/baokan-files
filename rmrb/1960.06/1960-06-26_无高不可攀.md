    No Height is Unreachable
    The entire Chinese mountaineering team, returning triumphantly from Mount Everest, has arrived back in the nation's capital. Today, the people of the capital are holding a grand gathering to welcome the mountaineering heroes who have, for the first time in history, conquered the world's highest peak from the north face. We take this opportunity to once again extend our warm congratulations and heartfelt greetings to all members of the Chinese mountaineering team who have endured countless hardships, overcome numerous difficulties, and created a miracle in the history of world mountaineering!
    Mount Everest, at 8,882 meters above sea level, is the highest peak on Earth. From early times, mountaineers, explorers, and scientists from various countries have shown great interest in it. However, Mount Everest's unparalleled height and treacherous terrain, as well as its harsh climate, have long daunted people. Towering alone atop the Himalayas, Mount Everest has indeed set countless natural barriers for people. The layers upon layers of cliffs, the endless snow-capped ridges and glaciers, the unpredictable climate at high altitudes, the roaring winds, the piercing cold, the all-encompassing fog, the towering snow plumes whipped up by swirling winds, and the avalanches and icefalls, with hundreds of tons of ice and rock cascading down like volcanic eruptions, have laid unpredictable dangers in people's paths. The altitude of 8,000 meters above sea level was long ago declared "the edge of death" by past aviation physiology. In people's minds, Mount Everest was unscalable, something to be admired but never reached. Since human mountaineering activities began in 1786, it was not until the 1920s, more than a century later, that people began attempting to climb this world's highest peak, known as the "mysterious region." For decades, groups of mountaineering teams from capitalist countries, with the help of Chinese, Indian, and Nepalese laborers who served as porters and coolies, attempted to climb Mount Everest. It is said that only in 1953 and 1956 did a few mountaineers climb to the summit from the relatively gentler south face. As for climbing Mount Everest from the north face, it had never been successfully achieved in history. Starting in 1921, British mountaineering teams had tried seven times to climb Mount Everest from the north face, but they failed time and again. In the end, they had no choice but to retreat, knowing the difficulty.
    The Chinese people were not daunted by these difficulties. The great victory of the Chinese mountaineering team in climbing Mount Everest from the north face fully demonstrates the soaring ambition of the liberated Chinese people to conquer nature. More than two hundred outstanding sons and daughters of the Han and Tibetan nationalities from factories, rural areas, the military, fire brigades, and scientific research institutions across the country formed a strong mountaineering team, determined to compete with Mount Everest in height. The high-speed Great Leap Forward in our great motherland's socialist construction and the soaring ambition displayed by the people of the whole country in this great cause inspired all members of the mountaineering team to vow to trample Mount Everest under their feet. The poems "Heroes surpass mountains and rivers, daring to laugh at Everest's height" and "Treading on snow and ice, flying across cliffs, we will surely make the red flag flutter at the summit" were widely recited in the mountaineering camp. With this fearless revolutionary heroism, the Chinese mountaineering team began its long march to climb Mount Everest. Those so-called "insurmountable" treacherous sections like the "Second Step" and the "North Col" were all overcome by the Chinese mountaineering team. All the myths that it was impossible to climb Mount Everest from the north face were shattered. The Chinese mountaineering team, with only five years of mountaineering history, completed the great achievement that capitalist countries with more than a hundred years of mountaineering history had been unable to accomplish. In this world-shaking mountaineering activity, in addition to three Han and Tibetan team members placing the Five-Star Red Flag and a plaster bust of Chairman Mao on the top of the world, twenty-five other Han and Tibetan team members reached altitudes of 8,100 to 8,700 meters above sea level, and another twenty-five Han and Tibetan team members reached an altitude of 7,600 meters above sea level, all breaking China's previous highest mountaineering record of 7,590 meters for men. Never before in the history of world mountaineering have so many people reached such heights in a single mountaineering activity.
    The victory of climbing Mount Everest is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which closely integrates strategically looking down on difficulties with tactically taking difficulties seriously. Our heroic mountaineers regarded the numerous natural barriers leading to Mount Everest as smooth paths, vowing not to turn back until they reached the summit; while for every difficulty on the road ahead, they made full estimations and thorough preparations. They summarized the experience of our country in carrying out mountaineering activities, formulated an overall plan to climb Mount Everest in four stages; through scientific meteorological analysis, they grasped the patterns of climate change on Mount Everest and chose the most favorable time for climbing; they carried out arduous training and mastered various mountaineering techniques; they organized three acclimatization marches to gradually adapt to the climate and environment of high mountains; before each march, they carried out multiple reconnaissance missions to choose the most favorable route, and repeatedly studied every glacier, every snow ridge, and every cliff that had to be passed, chopping ice steps, tying ropes, and erecting hanging ladders on steep ice walls; throughout the entire mountaineering battle, they coordinated meticulous and superior logistics work, providing ample material supplies; all of these ensured that every step forward was both bold and solid. It was precisely this spirit of unity between strategically looking down on difficulties and tactically taking difficulties seriously that enabled the Chinese mountaineering team to smoothly overcome thousands of hardships and dangers and achieve the great victory of climbing Mount Everest from the north face for the first time in human history. The victory of climbing Mount Everest is also a victory for the lofty communist style of "leaving the difficulties to oneself and giving the honor to others." Under the strong leadership of the Party and under the ideological education of collectivism and communism, the mountaineers cared for each other, supported each other, encouraged each other, and did not care about personal honor, gain or loss, or even life, and everyone worked together for the collective cause. Like the heroic transport team members who transported sufficient supplies all the way to the "assault camp" at 8,500 meters, the strong will and good physical condition of these comrades showed that they were fully qualified to reach the summit, but they regarded the collective honor as their greatest honor. In order to reduce the consumption of the main climbers and ensure the victory of the entire team, they took on the heavy burden and undertook the arduous work without recognition. And like the outstanding Communist Party member Liu Lianman, in the most difficult moment, when he might lose his life without oxygen, he consciously gave his oxygen to others. These commendable heroic acts of collectivism and communism are the guarantee of victory and the guarantee that the mountaineering team was able to collectively and safely complete this arduous task.
    This victory once again proves that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, as long as we follow the idea of closely integrating strategically looking down on difficulties with tactically taking difficulties seriously, and as long as we fully develop the spirit of collectivism and communism, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and be invincible. What capitalist countries can do, we can certainly do; what capitalist countries cannot do, we can certainly do. This is true in mountaineering, and it is also true in all undertakings to conquer nature.
    A few years ago, the heroes who built the Kangzang Highway put forward a famous slogan: "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and let the rivers make way!" Our Party spread this heroic slogan throughout the country, inspiring the people of the whole country to overcome all difficulties and win victories in various undertakings of socialist construction. Today, the Yellow River, which has been the most difficult to tame since ancient times, has been cut off by us section by section, and the highest mountain in the world has also been conquered by us. For the liberated Chinese people, it is truly "no depth that cannot be measured, no height that cannot be reached." As we warmly celebrate the great victory of the Chinese mountaineering team in climbing Mount Everest from the north face, we must learn the dauntless revolutionary heroism of the Chinese mountaineering team, strategically despise difficulties, tactically take difficulties seriously, and like climbing Mount Everest, strive to climb the cutting-edge peaks of industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and more quickly build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science.

    无高不可攀
    从珠穆朗玛峰凯旋归来的我国登山队全体队员回到了祖国的首都。今天，首都人民举行盛大的集会，欢迎有史以来第一次从北坡攀上世界第一峰的登山英雄们。趁这个机会，我们再一次向历尽千辛万苦，克服了重重困难，在世界登山运动史上创立了奇迹的中国登山队全体队员表示热烈的祝贺和衷心的慰问！
    拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰，是地球上最高的山峰。很早以来，世界各国的登山家、探险家和科学家就对它发生了浓厚的兴趣。但是，珠穆朗玛峰无比的高度和险峻的地形，以及峰上恶劣的气候，一直使人们望而生畏。巍然独踞在喜马拉雅群峦之巅的珠穆朗玛峰，确实为人们设置了数不尽的天险。重重叠叠的悬崖绝壁，绵延不绝的雪岭冰川，高山之上变化莫测的气候，咆哮的狂风，透骨的严寒，弥天的大雾，被阵阵旋风卷起的擎天的雪柱和发生冰崩、雪崩时，千百吨重的冰岩和雪块像火山爆发一样喷泻而下，更在人们的历程中埋下了难以逆料的危险。拔海八千米的高度，则早被过去的航空生理学宣称为“死亡的边缘”。在人们的心目中，珠穆朗玛峰是高不可攀、可望而不可即的。从1786年人类开始登山活动以来，经过一个多世纪，直到二十世纪二十年代，才开始有人尝试攀登这座被称为“神秘地区”的世界第一峰。几十年来，一批又一批来自资本主义国家的登山队，借助为他们做挑夫、当苦力的中国的、印度的和尼泊尔的劳动人民的力量，尝试着攀登珠穆朗玛峰，据说直到1953年和1956年，才有少数几名登山家，从地形比较平坦的南坡攀上峰顶。至于从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰，则是有史以来从来没有得到成功的。从1921年开始，英国的登山队曾经七次试图从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰，但一次又一次遭到失败。最后，他们不得不知难而退。
    中国人民并没有被这些困难吓倒。中国登山队从北坡攀上珠穆朗玛峰的伟大胜利，充分显示出解放了的中国人民征服大自然的雄心壮志。来自祖国各地的工厂、农村、部队、消防队和科学研究机关的二百多名汉族和藏族的优秀儿女，组成了一支强大的登山队伍，要与珠穆朗玛峰比高低。我们伟大祖国社会主义建设事业的高速度大跃进，和全国人民在这个伟大的事业中所表现的雄心壮志，鼓舞着登山队的全体队员誓把珠穆朗玛峰踩在脚下。“英雄气盖山河，敢笑珠峰不高”，“踏雪蹬冰飞绝壁，定叫红旗顶峰飘”的诗句，在登山队的营地争相传诵。中国登山队就以这种大无畏的革命英雄主义，开始了攀登珠穆朗玛峰的长征。那些所谓“无法超越”的“第二台阶”、“北?”等等险恶的地段，一一被中国登山队超越了。不可能从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰的一切神话都破产了。仅仅只有五年登山运动历史的中国的登山队伍，就完成了具有一百多年登山运动历史的资本主义国家至今无法完成的伟大的业绩。在这次惊震世界的登山活动中，除了有三名汉族和藏族队员把五星红旗和毛主席的石膏像放在世界之巅以外，还有二十五名汉族和藏族队员分别达到拔海八千一百米到八千七百米的高度，并且还有二十五名汉族和藏族队员达到拔海七千六百米的高度，都打破了我国男子登山高度七千五百九十米的最高纪录。在一次登山活动中，同时有这样多的人达到这样的高度，在世界登山史上也是从来不曾有过的。
    攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，是把在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难紧密结合起来的毛泽东思想的胜利。我们英勇的登山队员把通向珠穆朗玛峰的重重天险视为坦途，不到峰顶，誓不回头；而对于前进道路上的每一个困难，又都作了充分的估计和周密的准备。他们总结了我国开展登山运动的经验，制订了分四个战役攀登珠穆朗玛峰的总体计划；通过科学的气象分析，掌握了珠穆朗玛峰气候变化的规律，选择了最有利于登山的时机；进行了顽强的锻炼，掌握了各种登山技术；组织了三次适应性行军，逐步适应了高山上的气候和环境；每一次行军前，又都进行多次的侦察，选择最有利的路线，对于必须经过的每一道冰川、每一座雪岭、每一处悬崖，都进行了反复的研究，刨冰阶、系绳索，在笔陡的冰壁上架起挂梯；在整个登山战斗中都配合了十分周密的优越的后勤工作，进行了十分充裕的物质供应；所有这些，就保证他们每一步的前进都是大胆的，又都是踏实的。正是这种在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难的统一的精神，使中国登山队顺利地克服了千难万险，在人类历史上第一次取得了从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰的伟大胜利。攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，也是人们“把困难留给自己，把荣誉让给别人”的高度共产主义风格的胜利。登山队员们在党的坚强领导下，在集体主义共产主义的思想教育下，互相爱护、互相支持、互相鼓励，不计较个人荣誉、得失以至生命，大家同心合力，为了集体事业而奋斗。像英勇的运输队员把充足的物资一直运送到八千五百米的“突击营地”，这些同志坚强的毅力和良好的体能，说明他们完全有条件登上顶峰的，但是他们把集体的荣誉看作自己最大的荣誉，为了减轻登山主力队员的消耗，保证整个队的胜利，他们把沉重的负担加在自己肩上，承担起默默无闻的艰苦的劳动。又像登山队员优秀的共产党员刘连满，在最困难的时刻，在没有氧气就可能丧失生命的时刻，自觉地把氧气留给别人。这些值得歌颂的集体主义共产主义的英雄行为，是胜利的保证，也是这次登山队员能够集体安全地胜利完成这一艰巨任务的保证。
    这个胜利再一次证明了，伟大的中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，只要我们遵循在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难紧密结合起来的思想，只要充分发扬集体主义共产主义的精神，我们就必然能够战胜一切困难，无往而不胜。资本主义国家做得到的事情，我们固然能做到；资本主义国家做不到的事情，我们也一定能做到。这在登山运动中是如此，在一切征服大自然的事业中也都是如此。
    几年前，修筑康藏公路的英雄们提出一个著名的口号：“让高山低头，叫河水让路！”我们党把这个英雄豪迈的口号传遍了全国，鼓舞着全国人民战胜一切困难，夺取社会主义建设各项事业的胜利。如今，自古以来最难驯服的黄河被我们节节拦断了，世界上最高的山峰也被我们征服了。对于解放了的中国人民说来，真个是“无深不可测，无高不可攀”。当我们热烈庆祝中国登山队从北坡攀上珠穆朗玛峰的伟大胜利的时候，我们要学习中国登山队大无畏的革命英雄主义精神，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，像攀登珠穆朗玛峰一样，奋力攀登工业、农业和科学文化等各项事业的尖端顶峰，更快地把我们的国家建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国！
