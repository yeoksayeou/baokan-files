    Anhui's summer harvest improved tools show great power
    In Anhui, the harvesting, transportation, threshing and other processes of the summer harvest mostly use improved tools and semi-mechanized tools. At present, about one million sets of various improved and semi-mechanized harvesting, threshing and other tools, and hundreds of thousands of modified transportation tools have been put into the summer harvest throughout the province.
    Various improved tools and semi-mechanized tools show great power in the summer harvest, generally improving work efficiency by several times, ten times, or even dozens of times compared with old-fashioned tools.
    The characteristics of Anhui Province's summer harvest tool reform this year are: early grasp, fast progress, and complete sets. In order to promote the new tools in the province in a timely manner, the Provincial Agricultural Tool Reform Office also organized performance teams to travel to various special districts with complete sets of advanced tools to organize cadres and the masses to visit and teach the use of technology.

    The number of pigs raised in Jilin increases month by month
    Jilin Province vigorously runs pig farms, expands the sow herd, focuses on reproduction and feeding management, and promotes the number of pigs raised to rise month by month. According to statistics in mid-May, the province's inventory reached 3.16 million heads, a net increase of 30.3% compared with the end of last year.

    Xinjiang conserves water and irrigates rationally
    All parts of Xinjiang have launched a mass movement to love, protect, and save water, which has doubled the efficiency of watering; the spring irrigation area has increased by more than 5 million mu compared with the same period last year, ensuring timely irrigation of various crops.
    While focusing on irrigation management, all localities have adopted the method of assigning leaders, assigning people, and assigning land sections to strengthen the management and maintenance of existing and newly built water conservancy projects, and tried every means to tap the potential of water sources. Dongfanghong Commune in Cele County, which is severely short of water, extracted 50% of its labor force and dug more than 1,700 wells and spring eyes in half a month.

    Fujian establishes more than 5,000 mass hydrological stations
    In order to strengthen flood control intelligence work, Fujian Province has established a large number of mass hydrological stations and carried out mass hydrological observation and research work. Most of the province's communes, brigades, reservoirs, power stations, farms, small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, etc. have established more than 5,000 hydrological stations.
    Fujian belongs to mountain stream-type rivers, and the floods in streams and rivers rise and fall sharply, and the rain surface distribution is uneven. Only by carrying out mass hydrological observation and research work can we grasp hydrological information in a timely and accurate manner.

    Wangkui comprehensively utilizes horse-drawn farm implements
    Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, comprehensively utilizes new-style horse-drawn farm implements, turning one tool into multiple uses, greatly exerting the role of new-style horse-drawn farm implements.
    In the past, the county's new-style horse-drawn farm implements could only perform single operations. After comprehensive utilization, they can be used in the main farm work throughout the year. For example, they slightly modified the horse-drawn seeder so that it can sow both dry land and paddy fields; it can both sow and hoe. The county is currently modifying more than 600 horse-drawn seeders. After the modification, it can be used for inter-row cultivation and weeding, which can hoe more than 980,000 mu of land, saving more than 32,000 man-days and more than 92,000 horse-days.

    Lezhi makes a simple wheat thresher
    The foot-operated simple wheat thresher created in Lezhi County, Sichuan, has been repeatedly tested and identified. It proves that it improves work efficiency by five times compared with manual threshing, and the threshing is clean and does not damage the wheat grains. During operation, as long as one person steps on the pedal, and one person delivers and transmits the wheat, 2,700 jin to 3,000 jin can be threshed per day.
    This thresher was researched and developed by Lu Yongquan, secretary of the Baolin District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and employees of the 7-1 Agricultural Tool Factory. More than 1,000 units have now been manufactured throughout the county, basically realizing the semi-mechanization of wheat threshing.

    Renhuai and other counties vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of wheat straw
    Some people's communes in Renhuai, Hezhang, Bijie and other counties in Guizhou Province are vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization of wheat straw. The wheat straw comprehensive utilization processing plant run by the Guanyinqiao Management District of the Haizijie People's Commune in Bijie County can produce 7 jin of maltose and 12 jin of wine from every 100 jin of wheat straw, as well as soy sauce, vinegar, and pulp. Seven communes in Renhuai County have begun to use wheat straw to manufacture pulp board and yellow cardboard.

    要闻快报
    安徽夏收改良工具大显威力
    安徽各地夏收中的收割、运输、脱粒等工序，大都已使用改良工具和半机械化工具操作。目前，全省投入夏收的各种改良的和半机械化的收割、脱粒等工具约有一百万部左右，改制的运输工具约有几十万件。
    各种改良工具和半机械化工具在夏收中大显威力，一般比旧式工具提高工效几倍、十几倍，甚至几十倍。
    安徽省今年夏收工具改革的特点是：抓得早，进度快，配套成龙。为使新式工具在全省及时推广，省委农具改革办公室还组织表演队，携带着成套的先进工具，到各专区巡回表演，组织干部和群众参观，传授使用技术。
    吉林养猪头数逐旬逐月上升
    吉林省大办养猪场，扩大母猪群，一手抓繁殖，一手抓饲养管理，促使养猪头数逐旬逐月上升。据5月中旬统计，全省存栏数达三百一十六万头，比去年年底净增30．3％。
    现在全省还有三十三万头怀胎母猪正在陆续产仔。
    新疆节约用水合理灌溉
    新疆各地开展全民性的爱水、保水、省水运动，使浇水效率提高一倍；春灌面积比去年同期增加五百多万亩，保证了各种作物适时灌溉。
    在狠抓灌溉管理的同时，各地都采取了定领导、定人、定地段的办法，加强原有和新修水利工程管理养护，并千方百计挖掘水源潜力。缺水严重的策勒县东方红公社抽出50％劳力，半个月挖井掏泉眼一千七百多口。
    福建办群众水文站五千多处
    为了加强防洪情报工作，福建省各地大办群众水文站，开展群众性的水文观测研究工作。全省大部分地区的公社、大队、水库、电站、农场、中小型水利工程等，已设立水文站五千多处。
    福建系属山溪性河流，溪河洪水暴涨暴落，雨面分布又不均匀，只有开展群众性的水文观测研究工作，才能及时准确掌握水文情报。
    望奎综合利用马拉农具
    黑龙江省望奎县综合利用新式马拉农具，使一具变为多用，大大地发挥了新式马拉农具的作用。
    这个县过去的新式马拉农具，只能进行单项作业，经过综合利用以后，在一年四季的主要农活中都能使用。例如他们把马拉播种机略加改装，既能播种旱田，又能播种水田；既能播种，又能铲趟。全县正在把六百多件马拉播种机进行改装，改装后，用于中耕除草，可以铲趟九十八万多亩地，节省三万二千多个人工和九万二千多个马工。
    乐至制成简易小麦脱粒机
    四川乐至县创造的脚踏式简易小麦脱粒机，经过反复试验鉴定，证明比手工脱粒提高工效五倍，而且脱粒干净，不伤麦粒。操作时，只要一人踩踏板，送麦、传麦各一人，一天可脱粒两千七百斤至三千斤。
    这个脱粒机是由中共宝林区委书记陆永全和七一农具厂职工研究制成的。现在全县已制成一千多部，基本实现了小麦脱粒半机械化。
    仁怀等县大搞麦秸综合利用
