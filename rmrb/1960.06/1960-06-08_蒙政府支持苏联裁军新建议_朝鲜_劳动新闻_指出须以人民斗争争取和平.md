    Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, June 6th: The government of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement today saying that the Mongolian people and its government warmly welcome and fully support the new proposals of the Soviet government regarding the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament.
    The statement pointed out that the reactionary imperialist bloc is unwilling to conduct negotiations on reducing armaments, which is the reason why the four-nation heads of government meeting was sabotaged due to the fault of the U.S. government.
    The statement said: "At present, just as the Western imperialist groups, headed by the American monopolists, are doing everything possible to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation and obstruct the peaceful resolution of mature international problems, the imperialists, and first and foremost the American ruling clique, still rely on war as a means of resolving international problems. The Soviet government's new proposal delivers the most serious blow to the imperialist groups' policy of aggression and is a clear example of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' persistent struggle for a rational resolution of the disarmament issue and the consolidation of peace."
    The statement said that the Mongolian People's Republic will continue to unremittingly fight alongside the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and with all peace-loving forces in the world, to defend and strengthen universal peace and for the security of all peoples.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 7th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today supporting the new proposals put forward by the Soviet government on June 2nd regarding complete and thorough disarmament.
    The editorial said: "What the U.S. imperialist aggressive clique is pursuing in the disarmament talks is not disarmament, but to deceive the people with empty talk of disarmament, attempting to gain time to strengthen the arms race and war preparations, in order to regain military superiority."
    The editorial said, "The U.S. imperialism's vicious actions of talking about talks with the Soviet Union on the one hand, and conducting military reconnaissance flights in preparation for a war against the Soviet Union on the other, fully exposes the essence of its old two-faced tactics and the true face of the cunning enemy of human peace."
    The editorial said: "All facts show that the U.S. imperialists are not pursuing peace but pursuing war. It also shows that there should be no illusions about imperialism, peace cannot be begged for, but must be won by the people's own struggle." "Only when the peace-loving people of the world unite as one, resolutely launch a struggle against U.S. imperialism, and always maintain vigilance, expose and shatter U.S. imperialism's war provocation schemes, can the desire to ease international tensions and consolidate peace be realized.
    The peace-loving people of the world must not be deceived by this or that 'peace' talk of the U.S. imperialists, but must unite the anti-imperialist, peace forces to further strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism."
    The editorial said: The new proposals put forward by the Soviet government regarding complete and thorough disarmament have opened up the possibility of progress for the stalled Geneva disarmament conference. All peace-loving people in the world are watching how the Western countries, headed by U.S. imperialism, will treat the new proposals of the Soviet government.

    蒙政府支持苏联裁军新建议
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出须以人民斗争争取和平
    新华社乌兰巴托6日电　蒙古人民共和国政府今天发表声明说，蒙古人民及其政府热烈欢迎和完全支持苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的新建议。
    声明指出，反动的帝国主义集团不愿进行关于裁减军备的谈判，这就是四国政府首脑会议由于美国政府的过错而遭到破坏的原因。
    声明说：“目前，正当以美国垄断资本家为首的西方帝国主义集团千方百计阻挠国际局势的缓和，阻挠和平解决成熟的国际问题的时候，帝国主义者，首先是美国统治集团仍然指望以战争作为解决国际问题的手段。苏联政府的新建议给予帝国主义集团侵略政策最严重的打击，并且是苏联和社会主义各国为合理解决裁军问题、巩固和平而进行顽强斗争的明显例证。”
    声明说，蒙古人民共和国将继续不懈地同苏联及其它社会主义国家、同全世界爱好和平力量在一起，为保卫和加强普遍和平，为各国人民的安全而斗争。
    新华社平壤7日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，支持苏联政府6月2日提出的关于全面彻底裁军的新建议。
    社论说：“美帝国主义侵略集团在裁军谈判中所追求的不是裁军，而是以空谈裁军来欺骗人民，企图获得时间，加强军备竞赛和战争准备，来挽回军事优势。”
    社论说，“美帝国主义一方面侈谈同苏联会谈，另一方面为了准备反对苏联的战争而进行军事侦察飞行的凶恶的行动，充分暴露了它的老一套的两面手法的本质和人类和平的狡猾的敌人的真面目。”
    社论说：“一切事实都说明，美帝国主义者不是追求和平而是追求战争。同时也说明，不能对帝国主义有任何幻想，和平不能乞求，而必须以人民自己的斗争来争取。”“只有全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致，坚决展开反对美帝国主义的斗争，始终保持警惕、揭露和粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅阴谋，才能实现缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的愿望。
    全世界爱好和平的人民决不能被美帝国主义者的这样或那样的‘和平’的空谈所迷惑，而要团结反帝、和平力量进一步加强反对美帝国主义的斗争。”
    社论说：苏联政府提出的关于全面彻底裁军的新建议，为陷入停顿的日内瓦裁军会议打开了前进的可能性。全世界爱好和平人民都在注视着以美帝国主义为首的西方国家怎样对待苏联政府的新建议。
