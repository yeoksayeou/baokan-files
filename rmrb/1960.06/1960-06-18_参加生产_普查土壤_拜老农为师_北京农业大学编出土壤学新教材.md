Participating in Production, Conducting Soil Surveys, and Learning from Experienced Farmers
Beijing Agricultural University Compiles New Soil Science Textbook

Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The Soil Science Teaching and Research Group of Beijing Agricultural University actively participated in agricultural production and construction, and the mass soil survey movement. Based on this, they vigorously reformed the teaching of soil science and compiled a new soil science textbook to serve agricultural production.

The new soil science course has undergone significant changes in terms of research objects, basic viewpoints, and content. In the past, soil science regarded soil merely as a natural body and rarely studied the enormous impact of humans on soil. The new soil science course clearly proposes that the research object is mainly agricultural soil, that is, the "soil" in the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, explaining that humans can not only change the properties of soil but also directionally control its development. In the past, the teaching material mainly focused on foreign soils, but now, based on the collected and sorted soil survey data from various regions of the country, it has been changed to focus on teaching about Chinese soils.

Corresponding reforms have also been made in teaching methods. Now, students taking the soil science course start by participating in production labor and soil surveys, establishing a correct understanding of soil from their own production practice and farmers' experience. Then, through classroom lectures and discussions, this understanding is elevated to a rational level. The entire soil science teaching is also combined with the growth of various crops, increasing the proportion of on-site teaching and strengthening the connection between theory and practice.

Many people in the Soil Science Teaching and Research Group originally believed that soil science was only responsible for understanding soil, not for utilizing and improving it. They believed that agricultural soil cultivated by farmers had destroyed natural soil, making it difficult to find patterns, so they had to go to remote mountains and wilderness to study soil. After the Great Leap Forward, the teachers of the Soil Science Teaching and Research Group led students to participate in agricultural labor and conduct soil surveys, and their understanding changed greatly. They personally saw that farmers were not only very keen in observing soil structure and properties but also had extremely high discriminating ability for the production performance of various different soils. In the mountainous area of Miyun County near Beijing, there is a kind of small yellow soil, which is viscous, impermeable, difficult to cultivate, and can only grow some drought-resistant crops. In the past, teachers believed that changes in soil properties would take hundreds or even thousands of years. To turn this small yellow soil into large yellow soil that is loose, permeable, and suitable for growing anything, it would be almost impossible unless the Chaobai River changed its course. However, farmers used a series of measures such as mixing sand, applying fertilizer, and deep plowing, and within two years, they turned the small yellow soil into large yellow soil, and the yield increased from tens of catties per mu to more than 600 catties. The heroic spirit of the broad masses of farmers under the leadership of the Party, who have turned the world upside down and transformed it, and their rich experience in understanding, utilizing, and improving soil accumulated from long-term production struggles, have deeply educated the teachers and students. The soil survey movement also gave teachers and students a vivid lesson in the mass line. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, they worked with the masses and completed the soil survey of 44 million mu of cultivated land and 200 million mu of mountainous land in just over a month, assisting leading departments at all levels and production brigades of the People's Commune in compiling soil chronicles and drawing soil maps, planting maps according to local conditions, and deep plowing and soil improvement maps. These work results have become important data for comprehensive planning. (Attached picture)

### 参加生产  普查土壤  拜老农为师  北京农业大学编出土壤学新教材

    参加生产  普查土壤  拜老农为师
    北京农业大学编出土壤学新教材
    据新华社17日讯　北京农业大学土壤教研组积极参加农业生产建设和群众性的土壤普查运动，并在此基础上大力进行了土壤学的教学改革，编出了为农业生产服务的土壤学新教材。
    新的土壤学课程，在研究对象、基本观点和内容方面都有了很大变化。过去的土壤学把土壤仅仅看成是一种自然体，很少研究人对土壤的巨大影响；新的土壤学课程明确提出，研究对象主要是农业用的土壤，即农业八字宪法中的“土”，说明人不仅可以改变土壤的性质，而且可以定向控制土壤的发展。教材内容过去主要讲外国土壤，现在根据所搜集和整理的全国各地区土壤普查资料，改以讲授中国土壤为主。
    教学方法上也作了相应改革。现在学生上土壤学课程，一开始是参加生产劳动和土壤普查，从自己的生产实践和农民的经验中树立对土壤的正确认识，然后通过课堂讲授和讨论，把这一认识提高到理性的高度。整个土壤学教学又同各种作物的生长情况结合起来，增加了现场教学的比重，加强了理论和实际的联系。
    土壤学教研组中有不少人原来认为土壤学只管认识土壤，不管利用和改良土壤，认为农民耕种的农业土壤把自然土壤破坏了，不好找规律，因而要到绝无人迹的深山野地去研究土壤。大跃进以后，土壤教研组的教师带领学生们下放参加农业劳动，并且进行土壤普查，认识有很大改变。他们亲身看到，农民不仅对土壤结构、性质的观察非常敏锐，对各种不同土壤的生产性能也具有极高的鉴别能力。北京郊区密云县靠山一带有一种小黄土，粘性大、不透水，难耕作，只能种些耐旱作物。过去教师们认为，土壤性质的改变是几百年甚至几千年的事。要把这种小黄土变成土性轻松透水，种啥长啥的大黄土，除非潮白河改道，否则几乎没有可能；但是农民用掺沙、施肥、深翻等一系列措施，在两年内就把小黄土变成了大黄土，产量由每亩几十斤提高到六百斤以上。广大农民在党的领导下发挥出来的翻天复地改造世界的英雄气概，他们从长期生产斗争中积累起来的对土壤的认识，利用和改良土壤的丰富经验，使师生们受到深刻的教育。土壤普查运动，也给师生们上了一堂生动的群众路线课。他们在当地党委领导下，同群众在一起，仅一个多月就完成了四千四百万亩耕地和二亿亩山地的土壤普查任务，协助各级领导部门和人民公社的生产大队编写了土壤志，绘制了土壤图、因地种植图、深耕改土图等。这些工作成果，已成全面规划的重要资料。（附图片）
