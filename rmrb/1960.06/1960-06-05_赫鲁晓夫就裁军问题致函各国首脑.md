Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd, TASS dispatch: Khrushchev's disarmament proposal takes into account certain arguments put forward by the negotiating parties. This proposal elaborates on the provisions for monitoring disarmament measures, which do not allow anyone to evade the implementation of a comprehensive and thorough disarmament agreement.

The Soviet government believes that this proposal should first be fully reviewed by the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, which will soon reconvene in Geneva.

The Soviet government is very skeptical that Western countries represented in this body want disarmament. In essence, what the Western countries are proposing is supervision without disarmament, and to put it bluntly, this supervision is nothing more than reconnaissance and espionage.

Following is the full text of a letter from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N. Khrushchev, to the heads of government of various countries regarding the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament:

I would like to discuss with you the most important issue facing the world today: comprehensive and complete disarmament. In this age of atoms, space rockets, and electronics, the need to take bold and far-reaching actions to seek a solution to the disarmament issue has become particularly acute. Is it not obvious now that reason can no longer tolerate the arms race, which leads to unprecedented catastrophes and has truly fatal effects on all aspects of social life?

While preparing for the Paris summit of government leaders, the Soviet government formulated a proposal that developed the plan for comprehensive and complete disarmament, which I, entrusted by the Soviet government, submitted to the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly for discussion last September. In this proposal, we considered certain arguments put forward by our negotiating counterparts, particularly the proposal made by the French government that measures be taken to destroy the means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets at the beginning of the implementation of the disarmament plan. The proposal also considered certain other suggestions made by many governments, including those made during the negotiations of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. However, unfortunately, we were unable to discuss this proposal at the summit of government leaders.

Recent events have not diminished, but have strengthened the Soviet government's determination to fundamentally resolve the disarmament issue and eliminate the arms race, which endangers the people of all countries and is not needed by them. Following its consistent policy of peaceful coexistence among countries, the Soviet government intends, as before, to make all necessary efforts to improve the international situation and improve relations between countries.

After returning to Moscow from Paris, the Soviet government discussed the current situation and came to the conclusion that the proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament prepared for the summit of government leaders must be submitted to the governments of various countries for consideration.

Relevant documents stating the content of the Soviet government's proposal for achieving comprehensive and complete disarmament are attached to this letter.

We are convinced that this proposal meets the requirements put forward in the United Nations General Assembly resolution on comprehensive and complete disarmament unanimously adopted on November 20, 1959.

I would like to remind you that the Soviet government's plan stipulates that in the first stage, all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets will be prohibited and destroyed—rockets of various ranges, military aircraft, surface warships that can be used to carry nuclear weapons, submarines of all classes and types, various cannons, and other means that can be used to carry atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. Obviously, only by unconditionally and uniformly prohibiting and destroying all means of transporting atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons from the military equipment of various countries can the security of various countries be duly guaranteed. It goes without saying that at the same time, all military bases on the territories of other countries must be removed, and all foreign troops stationed on these territories must be withdrawn, because the retention of such bases and troops may be used to attack neighboring countries.

Implementing these measures in the initial stage of the disarmament plan can eliminate the danger of a sudden outbreak of nuclear war and fundamentally change the international situation. In the subsequent stages, measures to prohibit nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction, disband troops, and abolish the military machinery of countries can be implemented, which will make it possible to completely and permanently eliminate war from human social life and end the arms race. As the disarmament plan is implemented, a portion of the funds freed up as a result should be used to provide economic assistance to underdeveloped countries.

As you can see from our proposal, it elaborates on the provisions for monitoring disarmament measures, which do not allow anyone to evade the implementation of a comprehensive and thorough disarmament agreement. We have formulated specific monitoring measures adapted to each stage of the disarmament plan, pointed out the targets of monitoring, and stipulated the structure and members of the monitoring agency, as well as the powers and authority of supervisors in various places. The detailed provisions on supervision in our new proposal once again prove that the Soviet Union advocates strict and effective supervision of disarmament.

The Soviet government believes that this proposal should first be fully reviewed by the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, which will soon reconvene in Geneva.

I would also like to emphasize that the Soviet government is very skeptical that Western countries represented in this body want disarmament. Although these countries also voted in favor of the resolution on comprehensive and complete disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, it gives people the impression that they are actually not prepared to implement this resolution. Everyone knows that the Western countries have put forward a plan in the committee that cannot be said to be comprehensive and complete disarmament in any way. Because even after the implementation of this plan, troops, military aircraft, tanks, cannons, military bases in other countries' territories, general staff headquarters, and nuclear bombs will still be maintained. In essence, what the Western countries are proposing is supervision without disarmament. To put it bluntly, this supervision is nothing more than reconnaissance and espionage. But no government that cares about national sovereignty can do this.

The Soviet Union hopes for genuine and thorough disarmament, hopes to destroy all types of weapons, and hopes to establish strict supervision of disarmament so that no one can be armed and no one can threaten with war.

The Soviet government's proposal stems from the sole desire to promote and accelerate an agreement on the most important issue of our time: comprehensive and complete disarmament. I sincerely hope that this proposal of the Soviet government will be understood and supported by your government. Sincerely, N. Khrushchev. June 2, 1960, in the Kremlin, Moscow.

    赫鲁晓夫就裁军问题致函各国首脑
    苏联政府的裁军建议考虑了谈判对方所提出的某些论点。这个建议中详细阐述了对裁军措施进行监督的条款，这些条款不允许任何人逃避执行全面彻底裁军的协议。
    苏联政府认为，这个建议首先应该由即将在日内瓦复会的十国裁军委员会加以全面的审议。
    苏联政府非常怀疑在这个机构内派有代表的西方国家希望裁军。实质上，西方国家所提议的是没有裁军的监督，如果直截了当地说，这种监督不是别的，而是侦察和间谍活动。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席尼·赫鲁晓夫就全面彻底裁军问题致各国政府首脑的信，全文如下：
    我想同您谈谈目前世界所面临的最主要问题——全面彻底裁军问题。在已经到来了的原子、宇宙火箭和电子的世纪里，采取大胆的、深远的行动以寻求解决裁军问题的必要性变得特别尖锐起来。现在，理智不能再容忍引向空前浩劫和对社会生活的各个方面产生真正致命影响的军备的漩涡，这难道不明显吗？
    苏联政府在准备政府首脑巴黎会议时，曾制定了一个建议，这个建议是我受苏联政府委托于去年9月提请联合国大会第十四届会议讨论的全面彻底裁军计划的发展。在这一建议中，我们考虑了我们的谈判对方所提出的某些论点，特别是法国政府提出的在实现裁军计划开始时，即能采取措施销毁把核武器送到目标的手段的主张。建议中还考虑了许多政府提出的，其中包括十国裁军委员会在谈判过程中提出的某些其他建议。但是，遗憾的是，我们没有能够在政府首脑会议上讨论这个建议。
    最近的事态不仅没有减弱，反而加强了苏联政府争取根本解决裁军问题、消除危害各国人民和为他们所不需要的军备竞赛的决心。苏联政府遵遁着它的始终一贯的各国和平共处的政策，打算像从前一样尽一切必要的努力使国际局势健康化并改善国与国之间的关系。
    在我从巴黎返回莫斯科以后，苏联政府讨论了目前的局势，并得出一个结论：必须把为政府首脑会议准备的全面彻底裁军建议提交给各国政府审议。
    陈述苏联政府关于实现全面彻底裁军建议的内容的有关文件随本函附上。
    我们确信，这个建议是符合联合国大会1959年11月20日一致通过的全面彻底裁军决议中提出的要求的。
    我想提醒您注意，苏联政府的计划规定，在第一阶段就禁止和销毁把核武器送到目标的一切手段——各种射程的火箭、军用飞机、可以被用来运载核武器的水上军舰、各级各类的潜水艇、各种大炮以及可以用来运载原子武器和氢武器的其他手段。显然，只有把所有运送原子武器和氢武器的手段从各国军备中毫无例外地一律加以取缔和销毁，各国的安全才能得到应有的保证。不言而喻，与此同时还必须撤除在别国领土上的一切军事基地和撤退在这些领土上的一切外国军队，因为保留这样的基地和军队，就有可能被用来进攻邻近的国家。
    在执行裁军计划的最初期就实现这些措施，便可以消除突然爆发核战争的危险，并可以根本改变国际形势。在随后的各阶段中，可以实现禁止核武器以及其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器、解散军队和取消国家的军事机器的措施，这将使得有可能彻底地和永远地把战争从人类社会生活中排除出去，并终止军备竞赛。随着裁军计划的实现，由此而腾出来的一部分资金应该用于给不发达国家以经济援助。
    您从我们的建议中可以看出，其中详细地阐述了对裁军措施进行监督的条款，这些条款不允许任何人逃避执行全面彻底裁军的协议。我们制定了适应于裁军计划各个阶段的具体监督措施，指出了监督的目标，规定了监督机构的结构和成员、各地监督员的权力和权限。我们的新建议中详细地规定了关于监督的条款，这个建议又一次证明苏联主张对裁军进行严格的和有效的监督。
    苏联政府认为，这个建议首先应该由即将在日内瓦复会的十国裁军委员会加以全面的审议。
    我还想强调指出，苏联政府非常怀疑在这个机构内派有代表的西方国家希望裁军。虽然这些国家在联合国大会上也投票赞成全面彻底裁军的决议，但是，使人有这样一种看法：它们实际上是不准备执行这一决议的。大家知道，西方国家在委员会上曾提出了一个无论如何也不能说是全面彻底裁军的计划。因为甚至在实现这个计划以后仍然会保持着军队、军用飞机、坦克、大炮、在别国领土上的军事基地、总参谋部和核弹。实质上，西方国家所提议的是没有裁军的监督。如果直截了当地说，这种监督不是别的，而是侦察和间谍活动。但是，任何一个关怀国家主权的政府都不能这样做。
    苏联希望真正的、彻底的裁军，希望销毁各种类型的武器，并对裁军建立严格的监督，以便使谁也不能进行武装，谁也不能以战争进行威胁。
    苏联政府的建议出自唯一的愿望，即希望能促使并加速就当代最重要的问题——全面彻底裁军问题达成协议。谨希望苏联政府的这一建议能得到贵国政府的理解和支持。此致敬礼尼·赫鲁晓夫1960年6月2日于莫斯科克里姆林宫
