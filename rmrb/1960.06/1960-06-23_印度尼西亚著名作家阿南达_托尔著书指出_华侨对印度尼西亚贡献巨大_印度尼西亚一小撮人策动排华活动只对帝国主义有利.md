Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Jakarta: "The Overseas Chinese in Indonesia," a book written by the famous Indonesian writer Ananta Toer, has recently been published in Jakarta. The book points out that the Overseas Chinese have long labored and struggled together with the Indonesian people, and are their friends and comrades-in-arms. The anti-Chinese activities incited by a small group of people in Indonesia violate the conscience and justice of the Indonesian people, and anti-Chinese activities will only benefit imperialism.
	This 200-page book proves with many facts that the Overseas Chinese have played an active role in the development of Indonesia's national economy and in the Indonesian people's struggle for national independence.

	The Overseas Chinese Have Labored Alongside the Indonesian People for a Long Time
	Making Significant Contributions to Indonesia’s Economic Development

	Ananta Toer points out in the book that from the 10th century onwards, in the process of working together with the Indonesian people, the significant contributions made by the Overseas Chinese to Indonesian agriculture, forestry, mining, fisheries, and other fields cannot be denied by anyone. He pointed out that the Overseas Chinese brought improved methods of planting and cultivating pepper, brought tea seeds to Indonesia, and introduced sugar-making tools that greatly increased production; pepper, tea, and sugar are now Indonesia's main products. The Overseas Chinese also opened the Bagan Siapi-api fishing port on Sumatra and reclaimed many barren mountains and forests.
	The author pointed out that before the arrival of Dutch imperialists, the Overseas Chinese were the first to introduce mining tools to the tin mines of Bangka and Belitung. After Dutch capital monopolized these mines, Overseas Chinese workers and Indonesian workers labored together, sharing the same fate, facing a common enemy.

	Indonesia's Economic Development is Hindered by Imperialist Capital
	The Overseas Chinese Economy is a Positive Factor in the Indonesian Economy

	"The Overseas Chinese in Indonesia" also points out that the Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese have jointly suffered oppression from imperialism and colonialism. The enemies of the Indonesian people are imperialism and colonialism, not the Overseas Chinese. It is imperialist monopoly capital that hinders Indonesia's economic development. It writes that the claim that the Overseas Chinese and their capital are harming Indonesia's national economy is a shameless slander, and this slander is to cover up the fact that there exists in Indonesia a truly and absolutely capitalistic, monopolistic foreign big capital—the American, British, and Dutch oil companies that are protected under official laws and regulations. The book reveals that those large foreign monopoly capitalists with the right to remit profits remit as much as 15 billion rupiah abroad each year through open or illegal means, and this does not include all their profits.
	The author emphasizes that excluding the Overseas Chinese economy, a positive factor in the Indonesian economy, creates greater difficulties for the Indonesian people. He said that the abolition of foreign small traders in rural areas "first and foremost hits the consumers in the countryside, who are also small producers, with the initial and final blow." The author calls on everyone to be vigilant against anti-Chinese elements. He wrote, "They certainly have their own interests."
	The author also criticized the inhumane actions taken against the Overseas Chinese by certain people in Indonesia during the anti-Chinese activities. He demanded respect for the basic human rights of the Overseas Chinese.

	The Overseas Chinese are Friends of the Indonesian National Struggle
	This Friendship Cannot Be Sacrificed for a Handful of Adventurers

	In a chapter entitled "The Overseas Chinese Can Become Comrades-in-Arms," the book enthusiastically praises the contributions made by the Overseas Chinese to the Indonesian people's struggle for national independence. He said that the Overseas Chinese are friends of the Indonesian national struggle. There are many facts to prove this before, during, and after the Indonesian independence revolution. The author pointed out that as early as 1740, the Overseas Chinese joined the Indonesians in resisting the brutal suppression of the Dutch colonialists. He also cited examples to show that the Overseas Chinese participated in the anti-Dutch war led by Diponegoro at the end of the 19th century, joining his army and providing material support. Starting in 1945, many Overseas Chinese joined the revolutionary ranks of Indonesia's struggle for national independence, and many Overseas Chinese gave their lives for it. In the famous Battle of Surabaya, many Overseas Chinese youths took up arms and fought alongside the Indonesian people, and many Overseas Chinese organized "wartime service groups" to serve the Indonesian Republic's army, and Overseas Chinese women participated in relief work.
	The author specifically cites the fact that many Overseas Chinese have received citations from the Indonesian Republic's army, and many have received the title of "Participant in the August 1945 Revolution," to prove the contribution of the Overseas Chinese in fighting alongside the Indonesian people.
	The author wrote that the Overseas Chinese have the right to be treated with civility by the Indonesian government.
	The author calls for maintaining the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. The author points out that the common enemies of the two peoples are imperialism and colonialism. This relationship must never be sacrificed to satisfy the political ambitions of those adventurers.
	He refuted the nonsense that the Overseas Chinese are a "fifth column." He pointed out that this is an inseparable part of the international anti-communist movement.

    印度尼西亚著名作家阿南达·托尔著书指出
    华侨对印度尼西亚贡献巨大
    印度尼西亚一小撮人策动排华活动只对帝国主义有利
    新华社21日讯　雅加达消息：在雅加达最近出版了印度尼西亚著名作家阿南达·托尔所写的“在印度尼西亚的华侨”一书。这本书指出：华侨长期以来同印度尼西亚人民共同劳动，共同斗争，是他们的朋友和战友，印度尼西亚一小撮人所策动的反华排华活动是违反印度尼西亚人民的良心和正义的，排华活动只会对帝国主义有利。
    这本长达二百页的书以许多事实证明，华侨对印度尼西亚民族经济的发展和对印度尼西亚人民争取民族独立的斗争起着积极的作用。
    华侨长期同印度尼西亚人民共同劳动
    对印度尼西亚经济发展作出重大贡献
    阿南达·托尔在书中指出，从公元十世纪起，华侨在同印度尼西亚人民共同劳动的过程中，对印度尼西亚的农业、林业、矿业、渔业和其他方面所作出的重大贡献是任何人也抹煞不了的。他指出，华侨带来了改良胡椒的种植和培养方法，把茶的种子带到印度尼西亚，介绍了大大提高生产的制糖工具，而胡椒、茶和糖现在都是印度尼西亚的主要产品。华侨还开辟了苏门答腊岛巴眼阿比渔港，开辟了许多荒山野林。
    作者指出，在荷兰帝国主义者到来之前，华侨首先把采矿工具介绍到邦加和勿里洞等锡矿。荷兰资本垄断了这些矿场后，华侨工人和印度尼西亚工人同劳动，共命运，面对着共同的敌人。
  印度尼西亚经济发展受帝国主义资本妨碍
  华侨经济是印度尼西亚经济中的积极因素
    “在印度尼西亚的华侨”这本书还指出，印度尼西亚人民和华侨共同遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫。印度尼西亚人民的敌人是帝国主义和殖民主义而不是华侨。妨碍印度尼西亚经济发展的是帝国主义垄断资本。它写道，所谓华侨及其资本损害印度尼西亚民族经济的说法是一种无耻的诬蔑，而这种诬蔑是为了掩盖这样一个事实：即在印度尼西亚存在着真正的和绝对的资本主义垄断性质的外国大资本——在官方的法令和条例下受到保护的美、英、荷石油企业。这本书揭露：那些具有转汇利润权利的外国大垄断资本每年通过公开的或非法的方式刮到国外去的利润多达一百五十亿盾，这还不包括它们的全部利润。
    作者强调指出，排斥华侨经济这个在印度尼西亚经济中的积极因素，对印度尼西亚人民造成更大困难。他说，取缔乡村地区的外侨小商贩这件事，“首先使农村中的消费者，也是小生产者，受到了最初和最后的打击”。作者要求大家对排华分子保持警惕。他写道：“他们的确有着他们自己的利益”。
    作者还抨击了印度尼西亚某些人在排华活动中对华侨采取的违背人道主义的行动。他要求尊重华侨的基本人权。
      华侨是印度尼西亚民族斗争的朋友
      不能让少数冒险分子牺牲这种友谊
    这本书在“华侨可以成为战友”为题的一章中热情洋溢地赞扬华侨对印度尼西亚人民争取民族独立的斗争所作出的贡献。他说，华侨是印度尼西亚民族斗争的朋友。在印度尼西亚独立革命前、革命时期和革命以后都有许多事实证明这一点。作者指出，早在1740年华侨就同印度尼西亚人一起反抗荷兰殖民者的残暴镇压。他还举例指出，华侨参加了十九世纪末迪波内戈罗领导的反荷战争，参加他的部队和提供了物力支援。从1945年开始，不少华侨参加了印度尼西亚争取民族独立的革命队伍，并且有不少华侨因而献出他们的生命。在有名的泗水保卫战中，不少华侨青年拿起武器同印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，许多华侨组织了“战时服务团”为印度尼西亚共和国军队服务，华侨妇女参加了救护工作。
    作者特别举出这个事实来证明华侨同印度尼西亚人民共同斗争的贡献：有许多华侨曾经获得印度尼西亚共和国军队所颁发的奖状，其中并且有许多人获得了“1945年8月革命参加者”的称号。
    作者写道，华侨有权利获得印度尼西亚政府的文雅的待遇。
    作者要求维护中国和印度尼西亚人民的友谊。作者指出，两国人民共同的敌人是帝国主义和殖民主义。绝不应当为了满足那些冒险分子的政治野心而让这种关系被牺牲掉。
    他驳斥了所谓华侨是“第五纵队”的胡说。他指出，这是国际反共运动的不可分割的一部分。
