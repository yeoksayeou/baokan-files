    A Trip of "Insufficient Anticipation"
    Su Ziming
    When plague god Eisenhower arrived at America's Pacific "island fortress"—Okinawa—he was met with a fierce anti-American demonstration of over a hundred thousand people. American officials, in describing the Okinawan people's demonstration, said sadly: the demonstration was "quite fierce. Worse than we anticipated."
    This sentence can actually be used to describe Eisenhower's entire Far East trip. The Asian people gave the warmonger Eisenhower a severe lesson this time. It wasn't as if American imperialism didn't know beforehand that the Asian people opposed their policy of arms expansion and war preparation, but the aggressive nature of imperialism forced Eisenhower to brace himself and come at the risk of danger. However, the unprecedented breadth and intensity of the Asian people's anti-American struggle was something he had not fully anticipated. Due to insufficient anticipation, when Eisenhower received Kishida's message asking him to cancel his "visit" to Japan halfway through the trip, a "look like he was sucking on a lemon" appeared on his face. (New York Herald Tribune) The trip to Tokyo was originally the main destination of his trip, but who knew that halfway there, he would be given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people, becoming a laughing stock in the history of international diplomacy. Due to insufficient anticipation, this time in Okinawa, he re-enacted Haggerty's embarrassing situation at the Tokyo airport.
    Eisenhower has now ended this bandit trip and sneaked back home amidst the cries of expulsion from the Asian people. Eisenhower's trip was a trip full of embarrassing appearances, a trip that was worse than he himself had anticipated. Although he has now sneaked back home, the Asian people and the people of the world will never forgive his criminal activities. The masses of people have already and will continue to use resolute struggle to severely teach him a lesson, until his demise.

    “预料不足”之行
    苏子明
    瘟神艾森豪威尔到达美国在太平洋的
  “海岛堡垒”——冲绳岛时，遇到了上十万人的猛烈的反美大示威。美国官员在形容冲绳人民示威的情况时伤感地说：示威
  “相当厉害。比我们预料的更糟。”
    这句话，其实可以用来形容这次艾森豪威尔整个的远东之行。亚洲人民这次给了战争贩子艾森豪威尔以狠狠的教训。美帝国主义事先也未尝不知道亚洲人民对他们扩军备战政策的反对，但帝国主义的侵略本性，使艾森豪威尔不得不冒着危险硬着头皮前来。然而亚洲人民反美斗争的空前壮阔和强烈，却是他没有充分预料到的。由于预料不足，艾森豪威尔在半路上收到岸信介要他取消“访问”日本的消息时，脸上“出现了像他啃柠檬时那样的表情”。（纽约先驱论坛报）东京之行原是他这次出行的主要目的地，谁知走到半途，就吃了日本人民的闭门羹，成为国际外交史上的千古笑谈。由于预料不足，这次在冲绳，又使他重演了哈格蒂在东京机场的狼狈相。
    艾森豪威尔现在已经结束了这次强盗旅行，在亚洲人民的一片驱逐声中溜回老家去了。艾森豪威尔这次旅行，是一次出尽洋相的旅行，是一次比他自己预料的糟还要糟的旅行。现在他虽然已经溜回了老家，但亚洲人民以及世界人民绝不会饶恕他的罪恶活动。人民群众已经而且还将用坚决的斗争来狠狠地教训他，直到它的灭亡。
