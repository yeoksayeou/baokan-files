    **Second March**

Led by Captain Shi Zhanchun, all members of the mountaineering team set off from base camp in batches, starting on April 6th, for their second acclimatization march.

On April 11th, the main force departed from the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level—the destination of their first acclimatization march—and began their perilous and arduous journey to climb the North Col.

At 11:00 AM, Mount Everest was shrouded in clouds and mist. The fierce northwest wind battered the rock faces of the North Peak and the main peak, carrying ice shards and granular snow like a rainstorm, whistling and swirling into a powerful whirlwind.

Mountaineers, armed with ice axes and crampons attached to their mountaineering boots, advanced along the ice slope of the North Col.

As the altitude increased and the slope became steeper, the mountaineers began to breathe rapidly, and their pace gradually slowed. People opened their mouths wide, gasping for air, yet still felt tightness in their chests, unable to catch their breath. Some had to stop and rest after only a few steps.

The wind and snow grew stronger, and the mountaineers’ pace slowed even more. At this moment, Captain Shi Zhanchun, who was leading the way, stopped. He looked at the weary expressions of his team members, smiled, and enthusiastically encouraged everyone: “Advance, comrades! Persistence is victory! We are heroic Chinese mountaineers, staunch warriors of the Mao Zedong era, and we have only one slogan: Forward! Always forward! The North Col cannot stop us, and the summit of Mount Everest cannot defeat us. We must achieve victory! And we will surely achieve victory!”

Shi Zhanchun's words were like a blazing fire, burning in the hearts of every mountaineer. People were instantly filled with confidence and strength. The ice slope seemed less steep and slippery, breathing seemed less difficult, and their pace became more rapid and steady than ever before.

Athlete Liu Lianman—a firefighter from Harbin—was the first to climb to the top of the ice crevasse that the mountaineers called "Ice Alley." After a day of exhaustion, he longed to sit down and rest. But when he saw his companions still below the "Ice Alley," he resolutely stood up, using his ice axe for support, then grabbed a nylon rope and lowered it down the vertical "Ice Alley" to help his companions climb up one by one. Two hours passed, and his clothes were soaked with sweat, and his limbs were extremely sore, but he still did not rest until all the team members had climbed up.

In this way, the mountaineers safely crossed the ice slope of the North Col and ascended to an area more than 7,000 meters above sea level on Mount Everest. However, the main force was later prevented from advancing further by a snowstorm. Only the reconnaissance group reached an altitude of 7,300 meters, thus ending the second acclimatization march.

    **New Challenges**

Altitude is the goal that mountaineers strive to conquer. In the history of world mountaineering, some mountaineers, due to differences in physical condition and high-altitude adaptation ability, have been fortunate enough to conquer altitude, while others have been exhausted by altitude and suffered failure. Therefore, in some countries around the world, there is a so-called "altitude limit," which holds that there is an implicit limit to a mountaineer's ability to conquer altitude.

China's highest altitude record for male mountaineers is 7,590 meters above sea level. This record was set by athletes Shi Zhanchun, Liu Lianman, Liu Dayi, and three other mountaineers when they conquered Mount Gongga in Sichuan in 1957. In the years since, no one in China has reached a higher altitude.

What would the ice, snow, climate, and terrain be like above 7,590 meters above sea level, and what would be the human body's reaction? These were all new challenges for Chinese mountaineers. Before the Chinese mountaineering team began its third acclimatization march—advancing to areas above 7,600 meters above sea level—the mountaineering team headquarters launched a mass movement among all team members to contribute ideas and strategies for conquering new heights. The mountaineers used their brains, fully assessed all possible situations that might occur at the new altitude, conducted careful analysis and research, and proposed many corresponding solutions. The mountaineering team headquarters then formulated a detailed plan for the third march based on these suggestions.

    **Third March**

The third acclimatization march began on April 25th.

On April 29th, all members of the Chinese mountaineering team set off from the camp near the North Col at 7,007 meters above sea level, stepped onto the ridge of Mount Everest, and began their third acclimatization march to conquer new heights.

The climate in Mount Everest is ever-changing. The sky above the North Col had just been sunny and cloudless, but in an instant, a storm blew up, turning the sky dark and the temperature plummeted to around minus 37 degrees Celsius.

The mountaineers advanced against the cold wind on a sloping snowfield.

The snow was deep and soft. With each step, they sank more than a foot deep. After a few steps, they were exhausted and sore all over. The mountaineers had to stop and rest almost every one or two steps; almost every few minutes, they had to lie flat on the snow to avoid the cold wind. However, no one in the mountaineering team fell behind. They gritted their teeth and moved forward one after another.

In the evening, the high-altitude wind became even more violent, and the temperature continued to drop. The mountaineers wore specially made cold-proof fleece hats, high-quality nylon and down clothing, and thick, warm mountaineering boots, but they were still shivering all over. The breath they exhaled immediately condensed into a circle of white frost around their mouths, and their nostrils were quickly frozen and covered with ice, making it difficult to even breathe.

    **Reaching New Heights**

The main force now stepped onto a rocky slope strewn with rocks and continued to advance.

As the altitude increased, the air became even thinner. People became weak, and activities became difficult. With each step, their hearts pounded violently, and they gasped for breath. When the main force passed a section of rocky slope near 7,400 meters above sea level that was less than 20 meters in a straight line, they had to rest four times before climbing up.

A wide and steep snow gully blocked the way. The snow had turned into hard, thick ice, which was smooth and slippery. Even with mountaineering boots fitted with steel nails, they still slipped and fell from time to time. Athlete Liu Lianman carried a backpack weighing more than 30 kilograms, but he volunteered to go to the front of the team. He used the "three-beat method" of mountaineering technique to walk forward and clear the way for the main force. He first braced himself with his ice axe to stand firmly on the ice, and then used his ice axe to carve out steps on the ice, one at a time. At this altitude, every movement consumed the strength of the whole body. But Liu Lianman persisted in clearing the way for the main force. Due to high-altitude hypoxia and severe physical exertion, Liu Lianman's eyes often flashed with "stars," and his chest was painful and swollen. Several times he almost fell, but when he thought of the entire main force advancing along the path he had cleared, he felt the weight of his responsibility and quickened his pace. Only when the main force came to a rock to rest did Liu Lianman breathe a sigh of relief.

After two days of arduous marching, the main force finally safely reached a height of 7,600 meters—a new height in the history of Chinese mountaineering.

    红旗杆上了珠穆朗玛峰

    第二次行军
    登山队全体队员在队长史占春的率领下，从4月6日开始分批先后由大本营出发，开始了第二次适应性进军。
    4月11日，大队从第一次适应性行军时到达过的目的地——拔海六千四百米的营地出发，攀登北坳，又开始了险峻而艰苦的旅程。
    上午十一时，珠穆朗玛峰上空云雾缭绕，猛烈的西北风冲击着北峰和主峰的岩壁，带着暴雨一样的冰渣和粒雪，嘶啸着，翻滚着，形成一股强力的旋风。
    登山队员们拿着冰镐，在高山靴底绑上冰爪，沿着北坳冰坡前进。
    随着高度的上升和坡度的险陡，登山队员们呼吸开始变得急促，脚步也逐渐缓慢下来。人们张大了嘴拼命地吸气，仍然感到胸脯闭塞，喘不过气来。有的人每走几步，就不得不停下来休息一会。
    风雪更大了，登山队员们的脚步也就更慢了。这时，走在最前面的队长史占春停了下来，他望了望队员们疲惫的神情，笑了笑，热情地鼓励大家说：“前进，同志们！坚持就是胜利！我们是英雄的中国登山队员，毛泽东时代的坚强战士，我们的口号只有一个：向前！永远向前！北坳阻挡不了我们，珠穆朗玛峰顶峰也难不了我们，我们一定要取得胜利！也一定能取得胜利！”
    史占春的话像一把烈火，在每一个登山队员的心灵中燃烧起来。人们又顿时充满了信心，充满了力量，冰坡也显得不那样陡滑，呼吸也显得并不那样困难，他们的脚步开始变得比任何时候都更加迅速而稳健。
    运动健将刘连满——一位来自哈尔滨的消防员，最先攀到被登山队员们称作“冰胡同”的冰裂缝的顶部。累了一天，多想赶快坐下来休息一会啊。但当他看到自己的同伴们还停留在“冰胡同”下面时，他坚决地站起来，用冰镐保护着自己，然后抓起一根尼龙绳垂到竖着的“冰胡同”下面，用力帮助同伴们一个个地向上攀登。两个小时过去了，汗水湿透了他的衣衫，四肢也十分酸疼，但他仍不休息，直到队员们全部上完为止。
    就这样，登山队员们安全地通过了北坳冰坡，登到了珠穆朗玛峰拔海七千米以上的地带。但后来由于暴风雪所阻，大队没能再继续前进，只是侦察组曾到达拔海七千三百米的高度，这样，就结束了第二次的适应性行军。
    新的课题
    高度是登山运动员征服的目标。在世界登山运动史上，登山运动员们由于体质条件和高山适应能力的差别，有些人成了征服高度的幸运者，有些人却被高度弄得筋疲力尽，而遭到失败。因此，在世界有些国家中，都流传着所谓“高度极限”的说法，认为登山运动员征服高度的能力有不言而喻的极限。
    我国登山运动男子的高度最高纪录是拔海七千五百九十米。这个纪录是运动健将史占春、刘连满和刘大义等六名登山运动员在1957年征服四川贡嘎山时创造的。以后几年来，我国没有人达到过比他们更高的高度。
    在拔海七千五百九十米这个高度以上，冰雪、气候、地势会是怎样，人体机能的反应又会是怎样，这一系列的问题，对于中国登山运动员来说，都是新的课题。中国登山队在开始第三次适应性行军——向拔海七千六百米以上的地区进发以前，登山队队部在全体队员中，展开了一个为征服新高度的群众献计献策的运动。登山队员们开动脑筋，充分估计了在新的高度上可能发生的各种情况，进行了仔细的分析和研究，并提出了许多相应的解决办法。登山队队部就根据这些意见，制订了第三次行军的详尽计划。
    第三次行军
    第三次适应性行军从4月25日开始了。
    4月29日，中国登山队全体队员从拔海七千零七米的北坳附近的营地出发，跨上了珠穆朗玛峰的山脊，开始了第三次适应性行军征服新高度的战斗。
    珠穆朗玛山中的气候瞬息万变。北坳上空刚刚还是阳光灿烂、万里无云，霎时却刮起暴风，变得天昏地暗，气温骤然下降到摄氏零下三十七度左右。
    登山队员们顶着寒风行进在一道倾斜的雪坡上。
    雪，深厚而松软。一脚下去，踩进一尺多深。走几步，就累得人满身酸疼。登山队员们几乎每走一、两步，就不得不停下来休息；几乎每隔几分钟，就不得不全身匍伏到雪地上以避寒风。但是，登山队员中没有一个人掉队，他们咬紧牙关，一个跟着一个向前走去。
    傍晚，高空风更加狂暴，气温还在继续下降。登山队员们头上戴着特制的防寒毛绒帽，身上穿着高质量的尼龙衣裤和鸭绒衣裤，脚下是坚厚保暖的高山靴，但是，他们一个个仍然被冻得全身战栗。呼出来的气立刻在嘴边凝成了一圈白霜，鼻孔很快就被冰冻封盖住，连吸气都发生困难。
    登上新高度
    大队现在跨上了乱石垒垒的岩石坡，继续前进。
    随着拔海高度的上升，空气中氧气更加稀薄。人们在这里变得虚弱了，活动变得困难了，每移动一步，心脏就剧烈地蹦跳起来，呼吸时上气不接下气。在大队通过拔海七千四百米附近一段直线距离不到二十米的岩坡时，人们竟不得不休息了四次才攀登上去。
    一道宽阔而陡滑的雪槽拦阻着去路，雪已经变成了坚硬的厚冰，光溜溜的。穿着镶有钢钉的高山靴，仍然一走一滑，不时地跌倒。运动健将刘连满背上背着三十多公斤重的背包，但他仍然自告奋勇地走到队伍的最前面。他使用着登山技术中的“三拍法”，向前走着为大队开路。他先撑着冰镐，使自己在冰面上站稳了脚步，不时地用冰镐一下一下地在冰上刨出台阶。在这样的高度，每一个动作都要耗费全身的力量。但是刘连满却一直坚持着在前面为大队开路。由于高山缺氧和体力的严重消耗，刘连满的眼睛里不时地迸散着“金星”，胸口疼痛而胀塞，好几次他都几乎要倒下来，但他一想到整个大队正沿着他的开出的路前进时，他感到自己责任的重大，就又加快了自己的步伐。大队来到一座山岩下准备休息时，刘连满才松了一口气。
    经过两天艰苦的行军，大队终于安全地到达了拔海七千六百米的地方——我国登山史上的新高度。
