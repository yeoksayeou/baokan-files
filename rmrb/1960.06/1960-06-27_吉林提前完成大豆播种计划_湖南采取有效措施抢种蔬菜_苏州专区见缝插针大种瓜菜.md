Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th: Jilin Province has completed its soybean planting plan. Early-planted soybeans are already over an inch tall, and the seedlings are growing vigorously.

This year, soybean planting in Jilin Province was about ten days earlier than in previous years. Generally, the most suitable land was selected, and the planting was carried out after careful land preparation, ridge-making to conserve moisture, and increased application of base fertilizer. Seeds were selected from improved varieties such as "Little Golden Yellow," "Full Granary Gold," "Fengdi Yellow," and "Large Grain Yellow," and were artificially selected twice. At the time of planting, the seeds were mixed with soybean rhizobium, and the advanced experience of equidistant dibbling was widely promoted. In mountainous areas, because of the low temperature and short frost-free period, the increased production experience of intercropping corn and soybeans, which is easy for ventilation and light transmission, was vigorously promoted this year. Various places have also planted large areas of soybean experimental fields and high-yield fields, which account for about 15% of the province's soybean planting area. These measures have provided extremely favorable conditions for increasing the yield per unit area of soybeans and increasing total output.

In order to ensure the completion of the soybean planting plan, all localities have tried every means to expand the planting area. Soybeans like water, and various places have planted them on newly reclaimed low-lying land; some places have intercropped them in corn fields on a large scale; and some places have also used scattered land such as paddy field ridges and canals to expand planting.

Field management has now begun successively. On the one hand, fields are checked and seedlings are replanted to strive for 100% seedling emergence in every ridge; on the other hand, hoeing is carried out to promote the vigorous growth of soybean seedlings.

This newspaper reports: Hunan is seizing the time, with cadres taking the lead in person, organizing professional teams, and making full use of all available land to plant vegetables on a large scale.

In order to further improve vegetable production, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed all parts of the province that each canteen should have a dedicated person to grow vegetables; once the person is fixed, do not move them easily, even during the busy farming season. And instructed the local, municipal, county party committees and commune party committees, brigade general branches, must have a dedicated person to grasp vegetable production, specific study of canteen vegetable varieties arrangements, seasonal convergence, cultivation management and technical measures. All localities have promptly solved the problems of land, seeds, and technology, and quickly launched a mass movement to rush-plant early-maturing vegetables. Ningxiang County adopted the method of combining professional teams with mass assault, mobilized 150,000 people, and planted more than 123,400 mu of hot water cabbage, radish greens, rapeseed, amaranth, cucumber, water spinach, etc. The county established an early-maturing vegetable production command structure at all levels from the commune to the production team, and determined that more than 10,000 cadres, including the deputy secretary of the commune party committee, the deputy captain of the production brigade, the deputy leader of the work team, and the canteen accountant, would specifically lead vegetable production and implement three guarantees (guarantee ideological mobilization, guarantee the solution of specific problems, and guarantee the completion of planting tasks on time, in quantity, and with quality). Comrade Li Xueliang, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally went deep into the Xiaduo Pu commune to plant vegetables together with the commune members. Daoxian widely carried out the movement of interplanting and intercropping early-maturing vegetables, made full use of all available land, fixed 5,110 people in the county to grow vegetables, and established a responsibility system for vegetable growers.

During sowing, all localities generally achieved fine soil preparation, uniform sowing, and universally applied human manure and burnt soil ash to ensure the quality of sowing. After sowing, in addition to fixed professional teams implementing the management responsibility system to strengthen cultivation management, they also carried out appraisals and competitions, inserted red flags, established pacesetters, promptly commended units with good vegetable planting results, and promoted advanced experience.

This newspaper reports: While grasping summer planting, all parts of Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are planting melons and vegetables wherever space is available. Recently, more than 200,000 mu of melons and vegetables have been newly planted. Including the previous ones, there are a total of 370,000 mu of vegetable land in the entire region, with an average of one fen of vegetable land per person.

In planting melons and vegetables, all localities have vigorously promoted multiple cropping and intercropping to fully improve land utilization. Guli Commune in Changshu County generally promotes the method of intercropping tall and short stalk crops, interplanting sweet potatoes and soybeans in corn fields, and intercropping corn and sorghum in pumpkin fields. Taicang County, known for its skillful farming, utilizes pumpkin fields to intercrop vegetables and yams, watermelon fields to intercrop vegetables, and medicinal material fields to intercrop vegetables and melons, doing whatever can be intercropped and whatever can be interplanted.

Wanfeng Brigade of Xinmao Commune in this county also held a meeting of skillful farming veteran farmers to summarize vegetable growing experience, further develop the experience of planting pumpkins, yams, corn, carrots, etc. four times a year, and plans to insert spinach and cabbage again this year to turn it into six crops a year.

    吉林提前完成大豆播种计划
    湖南采取有效措施抢种蔬菜
    苏州专区见缝插针大种瓜菜
    新华社长春26日电　吉林省已完成大豆播种计划，早种的大豆已长出一寸多高，小苗茁壮。
    今年吉林省大豆播种比往年提前十天左右。一般都选择最适宜的土地，经过细致整地、起垅保墒、增施底肥以后才播种。种子都选择
  “小金黄”、“满仓金”、“丰地黄”、“大粒黄”等良种，并且经过两次人工粒选，播种时又用大豆根瘤菌拌种，普遍推行了等距点播的先进经验。山区因为气温低，无霜期短，今年大力推行了易于通风透光的苞米、大豆间种的增产经验。各地还大面积地种植了大豆试验田和高产田，这些田约占全省大豆播种面积15％。这些措施，为提高大豆的单位面积产量，增加总产量提供了极为有利的条件。
    为了确保完成大豆播种计划，各地都千方百计地扩大了播种面积。大豆喜水，各地都在新开垦的低洼地上种植；有的地方在苞米地里大面积间种；有些地方还利用水田池埂、渠道等零星土地扩种。
    现在已陆续开始进行田间管理。一方面查田补种，力争块块垅垅达到十成苗；一方面进行铲趟，促使豆苗茁壮成长。
    本报讯　湖南各地抓紧时机，干部亲自带头，组织专业队伍，充分利用一切可以利用的土地，大种蔬菜。
    为了进一步搞好蔬菜生产，中共湖南省委最近指示全省各地，每个食堂都要固定专人种菜；固定之后就不要轻易调动，即使农事大忙的时候也不要调动。并指示各地、市、县委和公社党委、大队总支，都要有专人抓蔬菜生产，具体研究食堂蔬菜的品种安排、季节衔接、培育管理和技术措施等工作。各地及时解决了土地、种子、技术等问题，迅速掀起一个抢种早熟蔬菜的群众运动。宁乡县采取专业队伍与群众突击相结合的办法，出动十五万人，大种热水白菜、萝卜菜、油菜、苋菜、黄瓜、瓮菜等共十二万三千四百多亩。全县从公社到生产队层层成立早熟蔬菜生产指挥机构，确定各公社党委副书记、生产大队副队长、作业组副组长、食堂会计等干部共一万多人，具体领导蔬菜生产，实行三包（包思想发动，包具体问题解决，包如时如数如质完成种植任务）。县委第一书记李学良同志亲自深入夏铎铺公社同社员一道种菜。道县广泛开展套种间种早熟蔬菜运动，充分利用了一切可以利用的土地，全县固定了五千一百一十人专人种菜，建立了种菜人员责任制。
    各地在播种时一般都作到了整土精细、撒播均匀，并普遍追施了人粪尿和火土灰，保证了播种质量。播种以后，除固定专业队伍推行管理责任制加强培育管理工作以外，还开展了评比竞赛，插红旗、树标兵，及时表扬种菜成绩好的单位，并推广先进经验。
    本报讯　江苏省苏州专区各地在抓紧夏种的同时，见缝插针，大种瓜菜。最近已新种上瓜菜二十多万亩。连同过去的在内，全区共有蔬菜地三十七万亩，平均每人有菜地一分。
    在种植瓜菜中，各地大搞复种套种，充分提高土地的利用率。常熟县古里公社普遍推行高低秆作物间种的办法，在玉米地里夹种山芋黄豆，南瓜地里套种玉米和高粱等。以巧种田著称的太仓县，许多地方利用南瓜田套种蔬菜和洋山芋，西瓜田套种蔬菜，药材田夹种蔬菜、瓜类等，做到能夹则夹，能套则套。
    这个县的新毛公社万丰大队还召开了巧种田老师傅会议，总结种菜经验，把一年种南瓜、洋山芋、玉米、胡萝卜等四熟的经验，进一步发扬，今年计划再插上菠菜、白菜，变成一年六熟。
