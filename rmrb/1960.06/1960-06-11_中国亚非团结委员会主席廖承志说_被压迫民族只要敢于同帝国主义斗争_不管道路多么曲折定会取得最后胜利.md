Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Chairman Liao Chengzhi of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee said in his speech at the welcoming meeting for the visiting delegation of Congolese political parties: Respected delegates of the visiting delegation of Congolese political parties, comrades, and friends:

　　On June 30th, the Congo is about to declare its independence. On the eve of the Congo's declaration of independence, we, the people of all circles in the capital, are holding a grand gathering here to welcome friends from the Congolese political parties delegation, and we feel particularly excited. On behalf of the people of all circles in the capital, and in the name of the 650 million Chinese people, I would like to express my heartfelt welcome to the friendly envoys of the Congolese people who have come from afar, and extend warm congratulations to the Congolese people who are about to achieve independence.

　　For more than eighty years, the Congolese people have suffered the cruel enslavement and oppression of the colonialists. The Congo is a very rich and beautiful place, seventy-six times larger than Belgium. However, the Belgian colonialists, riding on the heads of the Congolese people, have long sucked the blood of the Congolese people and ruthlessly plundered the wealth of the Congolese people, plunging them into the abyss of poverty and disaster. Under the cruel torment of the colonialists, the Congolese population has decreased sharply from the original 20 million to the current 13 million! What a shocking fact! This is the so-called "benevolent government" propagated by imperialism, and this is the product of the so-called "Western freedom and democracy" propagated by imperialism. In this case, how can the Congolese people, as the imperialists and their running dogs, the modern revisionists, say, live in harmony with the executioners who ravage them? How can they "tolerate" the robbers who plunder their wealth and do not allow them to survive? And how can they not rise up to fight resolutely against the colonialists?

　　The history of the Congolese people suffering colonial oppression and enslavement is also the history of the Congolese people's heroic struggle against the colonialists. For decades, the Congolese people's struggle against colonialism has been surging, one after another. Especially in recent years, with the rise of the entire African national independence movement, the Congolese people's struggle for independence has also developed vigorously. Since the beginning of last year, the Congo has continuously erupted in large-scale mass struggles against Belgian colonial rule. Although the colonialists carried out bloody suppression of the Congolese people and played various conspiracies and tricks, the Congolese people were not intimidated or deceived. On the contrary, the flames of the national independence struggle were ignited everywhere in the Congo. The Congolese people's tenacious struggle finally forced the Belgian government to agree to the Congo's independence on June 30 this year. A new banner of national independence will be raised in the heart of Africa. The Congolese people's victorious struggle has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, making the imperialist colonial system in Africa even more fragmented. The Congolese people's victorious struggle has greatly encouraged the African people's national independence movement and made an important contribution to the cause of the world's people against imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people, the Asian and African people, and all peace-loving people in the world warmly hail the great victory of the Congolese people.

　　The Congolese people, with their long experience in anti-colonialist struggle, are not satisfied with the victories they have already achieved, and have not ignored the arduous tasks of struggle they face. The Belgian colonialists are planning a series of conspiracies in an attempt to continue to control the Congo militarily, politically, and economically. The Belgian colonial army is stubbornly staying in the Congo, and the Belgian colonialists are sparing no effort to support a group of running dogs they have raised as their agents in the Congo. It is particularly worth noting that the Belgian colonialists are employing despicable and shameless means to sow discord in an attempt to split the unity of the Congolese people. However, these conspiratorial activities of the Belgian colonialists are being seen through by more and more Congolese people. The Congolese people deeply understand that strengthening national unity is the most important guarantee for winning and safeguarding national independence. Now, the various patriotic political parties and patriotic forces in the Congo are uniting. We believe that as long as the Congolese people further unite, form a broad national united front that does not include the enemy, and continue their efforts in the struggle, they will surely be able to continuously smash the destructive conspiracies of the colonialists and defend and develop their victorious achievements.

　　The Congolese people not only face the task of completely overthrowing Belgian colonial rule, but also face the task of opposing US imperialism replacing Belgium, controlling, and plundering the Congo. The forces of US imperialism have invaded the Congo since World War II. US monopoly groups have infiltrated the main economic sectors of the Congo through capital exports, and have plundered a large amount of Congo's resources, especially important strategic materials such as uranium and cobalt. As early as 1952, Eisenhower openly said: "I really can't understand what we would do without the Congo?" This clearly exposed the aggressive ambitions of US imperialism towards the Congo. US imperialism not only attempts to control the Congo economically, but also directly or in the name of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" establishes huge military bases in the Congo. When the Congolese people launched a mass struggle against colonialism in January last year, US imperialism used these military bases to help Belgium airlift colonial troops to massacre the Congolese people. This fact exposed the true face of US imperialism as an enemy of the Congolese people. However, US imperialism is now hypocritically pretending to sympathize with the independence of the Congolese people, attempting to use this method to conceal its aggressive ambitions, deceive the Congolese people, and make them lose their vigilance. This conspiracy of US imperialism will never succeed. We believe that the awakened Congolese people, having been able to get rid of Belgian colonial rule, will never allow US imperialism to enslave and oppress them again.

　　The Congolese people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism is not isolated. It is a component of the Asian-African national independence movement and a component of the struggle of the people of the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. Now, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, and in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, which are under the strict control of US imperialism, a storm of struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs has also risen. The largest general strike after the war that recently broke out in Japan marks a new upsurge in the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The common struggle against imperialism unites the Congolese people with the people of the world. The Congolese people's struggle encourages the people of the world and has also received the sympathy and support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world. This situation is very favorable for the Congolese people's struggle, and no force can stop the Congolese people from advancing towards new victories.

　　The era we live in is an era in which the imperialist system is further accelerating its collapse, and an era in which the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism is constantly achieving victory. History has proven, and will continue to prove, that in the face of the powerful people's struggle, imperialism headed by the United States can be defeated. The struggles of the Cuban and Algerian people very clearly prove this truth. Cuba is an island country with a population of only 6.5 million, only half an hour's flight from the United States, facing the direct threat of US imperialism. However, the Cuban people, relying on their own awakening and unity, and after a long period of struggle, finally achieved the victory of the national democratic revolution, and after the victory, they have continuously repelled the interference of US imperialism and defended the fruits of their revolution. The Algerian people persisted in a long national liberation war, giving the French colonialists and their supporters, US imperialism, a heavy blow, and achieved continuous victories. All oppressed nations, as long as they dare to fight against imperialism, will achieve final victory no matter how tortuous the road of struggle may be. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The life of imperialism will not be long, they have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people of the world will never forgive them." The day when the people of the world unite to drive imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is not far away.

　　The Chinese people have always been concerned about and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Congolese people. Every victory you have achieved in the struggle has brought great encouragement to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always stand with the Congolese people, the Asian and African people, and all oppressed nations and people to fight to the end against our common enemy.

　　Let us shout:

　　Long live the victory of the Congolese people's struggle!

　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Congolese people!

　　Long live the victory of the world's people's struggle against imperialism!

　　Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!

　　Long live world peace!

    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志说
    被压迫民族只要敢于同帝国主义斗争
    不管道路多么曲折定会取得最后胜利
    新华社10日讯　中国亚非团结委员会廖承志主席在欢迎刚果政党访华代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的刚果政党访华代表团的全体代表们，同志们，朋友们：
    6月30日，刚果就要宣告独立了。在刚果宣告独立的前夕，我们首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，欢迎刚果政党代表团的朋友们，感到特别兴奋。我代表首都各界人民，并且以六亿五千万中国人民的名义，向不远千里而来的刚果人民的友好使者，表示衷心的欢迎，向即将取得独立的刚果人民，表示热烈的祝贺。
    八十多年来，刚果人民受尽了殖民主义者残酷的奴役和压迫。刚果是一个非常富饶美丽的地方，它比比利时大七十六倍，但是骑在刚果人民头上的比利时殖民主义者，长期吸吮着刚果人民的膏血，无情地掠夺着刚果人民的财富，使刚果人民陷于贫困和灾难的深渊。在殖民主义者残酷的折磨下，刚果人口从原来的二千万人急剧减少到现在的一千三百万人！这是多么骇人听闻的事实！这就是帝国主义宣扬的所谓“仁政”，这就是帝国主义宣扬的所谓“西方自由民主制度”的产物。在这种情况下，刚果人民怎么能够像帝国主义者及其走狗现代修正主义者所说的那样，同蹂躏他们的刽子手和睦相处呢？怎么能够对掠夺他们的财富、不许他们生存的强盗“忍让”呢？又怎么能够不起来同殖民主义者进行坚决的斗争呢？
    刚果人民遭受殖民压迫和奴役的历史，也是刚果人民同殖民主义者进行英勇斗争的历史。数十年来，刚果人民反对殖民主义的斗争，此起彼伏，连绵不断。特别是近年来，随着整个非洲民族独立运动的高涨，刚果人民争取独立的斗争也有了蓬勃的发展。从去年年初起，刚果不断地爆发了声势浩大的反对比利时殖民统治的群众斗争。尽管殖民主义者对刚果人民进行了血腥镇压，玩弄了种种阴谋诡计，刚果人民并没有被吓倒，也没有被欺骗，相反地，却在刚果全境到处燃起了民族独立斗争的熊熊烈火。刚果人民的顽强斗争，终于迫使比利时政府不得不同意刚果在今年6月30日独立。一面新的民族独立的旗帜将在非洲的心脏升起。刚果人民的胜利斗争，给了帝国主义以沉重的打击，使帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系更加支离破碎。刚果人民的胜利斗争极大地鼓舞了非洲人民的民族独立运动，并且对全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的事业做出了重要的贡献。中国人民、亚非人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都热烈欢呼刚果人民的伟大胜利。
    具有长期反殖民主义斗争经验的刚果人民并不满足已经取得的胜利，并没有忽视他们所面临的艰巨的斗争任务。比利时殖民主义者正在策划一系列的阴谋，企图在军事上、政治上和经济上继续控制刚果。比利时的殖民军队死赖在刚果不走，比利时殖民主义者正在不遗余力地扶持它所豢养的一批走狗，作为它在刚果的代理人。特别值得注意的是，比利时殖民主义者正在施展卑鄙无耻的手段，挑拨离间，企图分裂刚果人民的团结。但是，比利时殖民主义者的这些阴谋活动正在为越来越多的刚果人民所识破。刚果人民深深懂得，加强民族团结是争取和维护民族独立最重要的保障。现在，刚果的各个爱国政党，和各种爱国力量正在联合起来。我们相信，只要刚果人民进一步团结起来，结成不包括敌人在内的广泛的民族统一战线，并且再接再厉地进行斗争，他们就一定能够不断粉碎殖民主义者的破坏阴谋，保卫和发展自己的胜利成果。
    刚果人民不仅面临着彻底推翻比利时殖民统治的斗争任务，而且面临着反对美帝国主义代替比利时、控制和掠夺刚果的斗争任务。美帝国主义的势力从第二次世界大战以后就侵入了刚果。美国垄断集团通过资本输出的办法，渗入刚果的主要经济部门，大量掠夺刚果的资源，特别是铀、钴等重要战略物资。早在1952年，艾森豪威尔就公开说过：“我真不能理解，如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办？”这就清楚地暴露了美帝国主义对于刚果的侵略野心。美帝国主义不仅企图在经济上控制刚果，而且还直接地或者利用“北大西洋公约组织”的名义在刚果设立庞大的军事基地。当去年1月，刚果人民发动反殖民主义的群众斗争的时候，美帝国主义就利用这些军事基地帮助比利时空运殖民军队，屠杀刚果人民。这个事实揭穿了美帝国主义同刚果人民为敌的真面目。可是美帝国主义现在居然假惺惺地装出一副同情刚果人民独立的模样，企图用这种办法，掩盖它的侵略野心，欺骗刚果人民，使刚果人民丧失警惕。美帝国主义的这种阴谋是决不会得逞的。我们相信，觉醒了的刚果人民既然能够摆脱比利时的殖民统治，就决不会允许美帝国主义再来奴役和压迫他们。
    刚果人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争不是孤立的，它是亚非民族独立运动的一个组成部分，是全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争的一个组成部分。现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前壮大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动日益高涨，在美帝国主义严密控制下的南朝鲜、土耳其、日本，也兴起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴。最近在日本爆发的战后规模最大的总罢工，标志着日本人民反美爱国斗争的新高涨。反对帝国主义的共同斗争把刚果人民和全世界人民联结在一起。刚果人民的斗争鼓舞了世界人民，也得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界人民的同情和支持。这种形势对于刚果人民的斗争十分有利，任何势力都阻挡不了刚果人民朝着新的胜利前进。
    我们所处的时代，是帝国主义制度进一步加速崩溃的时代，是各国人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争不断取得胜利的时代。历史已经证明，还将继续证明，在强大的人民斗争面前，以美国为首的帝国主义是可以被打败的。古巴人民和阿尔及利亚人民的斗争非常清楚地证明了这个真理。古巴是一个只有六百五十万人口的岛国，离美国只有半小时的航程，面对着美帝国主义的直接威胁。但是，古巴人民依靠自己的觉醒和团结，经过长期斗争，终于取得了民族民主革命的胜利，并且在胜利之后，又不断击退了美帝国主义的干涉，保卫了他们革命的成果。阿尔及利亚人民坚持了长期的民族解放战争，给了法国殖民主义者及其支持者美帝国主义以沉重的打击，取得了不断的胜利。一切被压迫的民族只要敢于同帝国主义斗争，不管斗争道路是怎样曲折，都一定会取得最后的胜利。毛泽东主席说：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们”。全世界人民团结起来把以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义从亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲赶出去的日子已经不远了。
    中国人民一向关心并且坚决支持刚果人民的正义斗争。你们在斗争中取得的每一个胜利，都给中国人民带来了很大的鼓舞。中国人民永远同刚果人民、亚非人民和一切被压迫的民族和人民一起，为反对我们的共同敌人斗争到底。
    让我们高呼：
    刚果人民的斗争胜利万岁！
    中国和刚果人民的友谊万岁！
    全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的胜利万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
