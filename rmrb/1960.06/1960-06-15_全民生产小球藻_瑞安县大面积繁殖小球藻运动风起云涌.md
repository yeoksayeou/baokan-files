	Mass Production of Chlorella by All the People
	——A Vigorous Mass Movement for Chlorella Breeding Sweeps Across Rui'an County
	中共瑞安县委畜牧办公室 (Livestock Office of the Rui'an County Party Committee)
	Under the correct leadership of the Party, the vast number of cadres and masses in Rui'an County, Zhejiang, have broken through mystical viewpoints and launched a vigorous mass movement to breed chlorella on a large scale. Now, the entire county presents a scene of total mobilization by the whole Party and all the people, with teams, farms, households, government offices, schools, factories, shops, and residents all engaged in breeding. According to statistics from May 10th, there are 1,150 production teams and 2,981 farms in the county breeding chlorella. In the past three months, over 15 million jin of algae liquid have been bred, opening up a broad source of feed for the high-speed development of livestock production. Currently, most areas have been using chlorella to feed pigs and cattle, greatly improving the nutritional status of livestock and saving concentrated feed. In Shanxi Commune, after feeding pigs with growth liquid, concentrated liquid, and algae powder, the amount of meat growth increased by 10-50% respectively.

	Persist in Putting Politics in Command
	Because breeding chlorella is a new thing, in the process of its promotion, the struggle between people's advanced and backward, new and old ideas is very prominent. At the beginning, cadres and the masses generally had insufficient understanding of the benefits of chlorella and held mystical views. For example, some said: "How can green sewage feed pigs? Why bother with this?" Some said: "Breeding chlorella is something unattainable. We don't understand science and technology, and we don't have chemical instruments. How can we do it?" Some well-off middle peasants sarcastically said: "Breeding chlorella is a waste of effort, like a toad trying to eat swan meat." In response to the above ideological problems, the County Party Committee convened a Standing Committee meeting to conduct a special study, made a resolution, and determined that the secretaries and ministers in charge of animal husbandry, and the directors of the Animal Husbandry Office would take charge. It also held several telephone conferences of commune secretaries and meetings of responsible persons of county-level organs and units to make arrangements. At the same time, it also widely carried out publicity and education, organized the masses to conduct special forum-style debates, and in particular, seized on the successful experience of Shanxi Commune in adopting indigenous methods to breed chlorella and increase pig production. It treated this commune as a school for promoting chlorella and a technology transfer station, and organized the masses to visit and study. The county newspaper and radio station regularly reported and broadcast news in this regard. Rui'an Middle School and Rui'an Normal School organized more than 1,000 teachers and students to go to the countryside with samples to promote the movement. Each commune also adopted methods such as conducting experiments, setting up on-site demonstrations, and organizing the masses to take turns to visit and learn. Through the methods of "if you don't believe it, take a look, if you don't understand, debate, if you don't know how, learn," it powerfully criticized various conservative ideas. In the movement, leaders at all levels personally went to the front lines. Ji Diankai, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, Yang Xiufeng, the Secretary of the Secretariat, Wang Weiguo, and other comrades respectively went deep into production teams, livestock farms, government offices, schools, and factories to make chlorella breeding models to mobilize the masses. Huang Qingyue, the Secretary of Shanxi Commune, and technicians and commune members persisted in experiments for seven months. This greatly educated and encouraged the vast number of cadres and masses. Ye Peng, the Secretary of the Party Branch of the County Iron and Steel Livestock Farm, led all the employees of the farm to work hard overnight and built seven cultivation ponds in five days.

	Rely on the Masses to Break Through Three Barriers
	In the mass movement to breed chlorella on a large scale, difficulties were encountered in terms of algae strains, technology, and equipment. However, by adopting the method of combining leaders, technicians, and farmers, fully mobilizing the masses, and launching a movement for everyone to use their brains and offer suggestions, the above difficulties were finally overcome one by one. At the beginning, there was a shortage of algae strains, and it was also the dead of winter. In order to provide the algae strains needed for large-scale breeding, various places adopted methods such as greenhouses, bathrooms, fire roasting, boiling water, sun exposure during the day, and charcoal baking at night to maintain a temperature of about 15 to 20 degrees Celsius to promote the reproduction of chlorella. The Feiyunjiang Farm created a warm water breeding method, harvesting three days in advance. Regarding the technical force issue, methods such as on-site meetings, short-term training, experience exchange, inviting in, sending out, and apprenticeship were adopted to quickly train 10,000 chlorella experts. Each commune also established technology transfer stations based on agricultural technology stations and demonstration livestock farms, formulated technical operating procedures for breeding chlorella, and promptly guided the technical issues in each link. On the issue of equipment, the "poor way" was adopted, making do with whatever was available, and mobilizing the masses to fully utilize old wooden barrels, stone troughs, water tanks, old manure pits, and dug mud pits to replace cultivation ponds. In particular, using mud pits to raise chlorella does not require a single brick, a single jin of cement, or oyster lime. As long as the bottom of the pit is compacted after digging so that it does not leak water, it can be cultivated. A mud pit of eight square meters and forty centimeters deep only costs two laborers, saving 68 yuan compared to a brick cultivation pond. When chemical fertilizer liquid was lacking, human and animal manure and bird droppings were used instead. In this way, the masses were mobilized to overcome difficulties in every possible way, starting from scratch, and spreading the flowers of chlorella to every corner of the county. This left those who believed that indigenous methods could not breed chlorella speechless. Although Rui'an County has achieved great success in large-scale chlorella breeding, the people of the whole county are not satisfied with the status quo and are working with even greater effort to complete the task of cultivating 10,000 mu of chlorella in 1960.

    全民生产小球藻
    ——瑞安县大面积繁殖小球藻运动风起云涌
    中共瑞安县委畜牧办公室
    在党的正确领导下，浙江瑞安县广大干部、群众，打破神秘观点，轰轰烈烈地开展了大面积繁殖小球藻运动。现在全县出现了一个队养、场养、户养、机关养、学校养、工厂养、商店养、居民养的全党全民总动员的局面。据5月10日统计，全县有一千一百五十个生产队，二千九百八十一个牧场繁殖小球藻，在近三个月来，已繁殖藻液一千五百多万斤，为高速度发展畜牧业生产开辟了广阔的饲料来源。现在，大部分地区已用小球藻喂猪、喂牛，大大改善了牲畜的营养状况，节省了精饲料。珊溪公社用生长液、浓缩液、藻粉喂猪后，长肉量分别增加10—50％。
    坚持政治挂帅
    由于繁殖小球藻是一个新鲜事物，在推广中，人们的先进与落后的新旧思想斗争显得非常突出。开始时，干部、群众较普遍地对小球藻的好处认识不足和有神秘观点，如有的说：绿污水，怎能喂猪，何必搞这个。有的讲：繁殖小球藻是高不可攀的东西，不懂科学技术，又没有化学仪器，怎么行呢？部分富裕中农冷言冷语讽刺说：繁殖小球藻是白费心机，是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。县委针对上述思想问题，召开了常委会，进行专门研究，作出决议，确定专管畜牧业的书记、部长、畜牧办公室主任来抓，并连续召开了多次公社书记电话会议、县级机关各单位负责人会议，作了部署。同时，还广泛地开展宣传教育，组织群众专题鸣放辩论，特别是抓住珊溪公社采取土法繁殖成功和喂猪获得增产的经验，把这个公社当作推广小球藻的学校和技术传授站，组织群众前去参观学习。县报和广播站经常报道和播送这方面的新闻。瑞中、瑞师组织师生一千余人，带样品下乡宣传。各公社也都采取搞试验、摆现场、组织群众轮流参观学习，通过不信就看，不通就辩、不会就学的方法有力地批判了各种保守思想。在运动中，各级领导人亲临前线。县委第一书记季殿凯、书记处书记杨秀峰、王维果等同志都分别深入到生产队、畜牧场、机关、学校、工厂做繁殖小球藻样版，来发动群众。珊溪公社书记黄青岳同志与技术员、社员一直坚持七个月的试验。这对广大干部、群众教育与鼓舞很大。县钢铁牧场党支部书记叶砰同志带领全场职工连夜苦战，在五天中建了培养池七个。
    依靠群众大破三关
    在大面积繁殖小球藻运动中，曾经遇到了藻种、技术和设备的困难。但是，采取了领导、技术员、农工三结合的方法，充分发动群众，开展一个人人动脑筋，个个献计策的运动，终于一一地战胜了上述困难。开始时，藻种不足，又是严冬之际。为了提供大面积繁殖所需的藻种，各地都采取温室、浴室、烤火、开水冲、白天太阳晒、晚上用炭烘等办法。莘塍公社利用学校的室内电光和木炭烤火，保持温度十五至二十度左右，促进小球藻的繁殖。飞云江农场创造了温水繁殖法，提前三天采收。对技术力量问题，采取现场会议、短期训练、经验交流、请进来、派出去、师傅带徒弟的方法，迅速培养了一万名小球藻能手。各公社还以农技站、示范牧场为基础，建立了技术传授站，制订了繁殖小球藻技术操作规程，及时地指导每一个环节的技术问题。在设备问题上，采取了“穷办法”，因陋就简，发动群众充分利用旧木桶、石槽、水缸、旧粪坑、挖泥坑来代替培养池，特别是用泥坑养小球藻，不花一块砖、一斤水泥与蛎灰，只要挖土后把坑底拍打结实，不会漏水，即可养殖，一个八平方米大，四十厘米深的泥坑只花二个劳力，比砖砌培养池节省成本六十八元。缺少化学肥液，就利用人粪尿和鸟粪来代替。就这样发动群众千方百计克服困难，白手起家，把小球藻之花开遍全县每个角落。使那些认为土法不能繁殖小球藻的人看得哑口无言。瑞安县大面积繁殖小球藻虽然取得了很大成绩，但是全县人民并不满足现状，正在鼓足更大干劲，为完成1960年养殖小球藻一万亩而努力。
