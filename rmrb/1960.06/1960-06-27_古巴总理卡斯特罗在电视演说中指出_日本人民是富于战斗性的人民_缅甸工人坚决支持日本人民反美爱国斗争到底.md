Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 24th: Cuban Premier Castro pointed out in his televised speech tonight that the Japanese people's great struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" shows that the Japanese people "oppose policies that put Japan in danger of atomic war." He emphasized that U.S. imperialism's forcing Japan to ratify this treaty has aroused the opposition of the Japanese people. Eisenhower had to stop his visit to Japan under the strong opposition of the Japanese people. He said that America's erroneous policies have similarly aroused anti-U.S. imperialist demonstrations in South Korea and Turkey. He emphasized that the people of the world are awakening and refusing to accept America's policy of strength, a policy destined to go bankrupt.

Premier Castro emphasized that the recent demonstrations show that the Japanese people are a militant and noble people. He said that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is just.

Castro emphasized that although Japan was an aggressor in the last war, the Japanese people were not at fault, because the war was launched by the Japanese imperialist and militarist oligarchs. Castro said that this oligarchy is as bellicose as the oligarchy that rules the United States today.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 25th: U Mya Maung, Deputy General Secretary of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, told Xinhua News Agency reporters here today, "Burmese workers will resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle until a complete victory is won."

U Mya Maung pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. They support reactionaries in other countries, establish military bases around socialist countries, prepare for war, and undermine peace. Their arrogant activities will inevitably be opposed by the people of the world.

The Japanese people's struggle prevented Eisenhower's scheduled "visit" to Japan and has forced the traitorous Nobusuke Kishi to resign. One victory after another will surely encourage the Japanese people to launch a struggle to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

U Mya Maung emphasized that Burmese workers will join hands with the working class of all countries in the world to oppose war, defend world peace, and thoroughly expose the U.S. imperialists' false peace conspiracy.

The Deputy General Secretary of the Burmese Trade Union Congress also said that the Burmese people, like the people of Southeast Asia, have fresh memories of the Second World War. During the Second World War, Japanese militarists killed tens of thousands of Burmese people, raped women, burned villages, and destroyed homes. Therefore, the Burmese people will stand on the side of the Japanese people and will resolutely oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." U Mya Maung said, "We will resolutely oppose the recurrence of the Second World War."

    古巴总理卡斯特罗在电视演说中指出
    日本人民是富于战斗性的人民
    缅甸工人坚决支持日本人民反美爱国斗争到底
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天晚间在他发表的电视演说中指出，日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的巨大斗争表明日本人民“反对使日本陷入原子战争危险的政策”。他强调指出，美帝国主义强使日本批准这个条约激起了日本人民的反对。艾森豪威尔在日本人民的强烈反对下不得不停止对日本的访问。他说，美国的错误的政策同样激起了南朝鲜和土耳其的反对美帝国主义的示威。他强调指出，全世界的人民都在觉醒，都拒绝接受美国的实力政策，这个政策是一个注定要破产的政策。
    卡斯特罗总理强调指出，最近的示威表明，日本人民是富于战斗性的崇高的人民。他说，日本人民反对日美新“安全条约”的斗争是正义的。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，虽然日本在上一次战争中是侵略国，但是日本人民并没有过失，因为战争是日本帝国主义、军国主义寡头分子发动的。卡斯特罗说，这个寡头就像今天统治着美国的寡头一样好战。
    新华社仰光25日电　缅甸工会大会副总书记吴苗密今天在这里向新华社记者发表谈话时说，“缅甸工人将坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争，直到获得彻底胜利为止。”
    吴苗密指出，美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。他们扶植其他国家的反动分子，在社会主义国家周围建立军事基地，准备战争，破坏和平。他们的这种蛮横的活动必将遭到全世界人民的反对。
    日本人民的斗争阻止了艾森豪威尔原定对日本的“访问”，并已迫使卖国的岸信介辞职。一个接着一个的胜利，必将鼓舞日本人民展开废除新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    吴苗密着重指出，缅甸的工人将同全世界各国工人阶级携手来反对战争、保卫世界和平，彻底揭露美帝国主义的假和平阴谋。
    这位缅甸工会大会副总书记还说，缅甸人民和东南亚的人民一样，对于第二次世界大战是记忆犹新的。在第二次世界大战期间，日本军国主义者杀害了数以万计的缅甸人民、强奸妇女、烧毁村庄、破坏家园。缅甸人民因此将站在日本人民的一边并将坚决反对新日美“安全条约”。吴苗密说，“我们将坚决反对第二次世界大战的重演”。
