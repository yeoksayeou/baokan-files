    Run Agricultural Science Experiment Stations Well
    Agricultural scientific experimentation and research in our country has already become a mass activity of the broad masses of farmers. A nationwide agricultural scientific experimentation and research network based on the people's communes has basically taken shape.
    It can be seen that with the advantages of the people's commune system being brought into play and the further development of commune-run agricultural scientific research activities, our country's agricultural science cause will advance by leaps and bounds at a rapid pace. At the same time, due to the effective activities of these agricultural scientific experimental organizations, they have universally become powerful assistants and consultants for the communes to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" according to local conditions, bases for promoting new scientific achievements and demonstrating increased production, and schools for cultivating a mass technical force that is both red and expert. Many agricultural labor models and advanced producers, who were originally illiterate or had little literacy, have raised their years of experience to rational understanding through carrying out scientific research in production practice, and are now researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences or provincial branch academies (institutes), and some have been hired to lecture at universities.
    The task now before us is how to go further and run the people's commune scientific experiment stations well, so that they can play a greater role in promoting the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.
    According to the experience of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in addition to strengthening Party leadership and adhering to putting politics in command, running commune experiment stations well must focus on three aspects: taking good production as the foundation, experimental research as the guide, and actively cultivating junior agricultural technical personnel. In other words, commune experimental research organizations must implement the policy of combining scientific research, productive labor, and cultural education.
    The history of scientific development tells us that the development of production is the fundamental driving force for promoting scientific progress. Without production, science cannot truly develop. Because the commune experiment stations in Guangxi closely combine their research activities with the key issues in local production, they have gained the support of leaders and the welcome of the masses. The Party committee calls them consultants and assistants, and the commune members say they are good teachers and helpful friends. They are run with great success and are getting better and better. If they are divorced from production and conduct experiments in isolation, they will not be able to achieve anything, and the experiment stations are destined to fail. Although we now have the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as a guide for agricultural production, our country has a vast territory and different conditions in different regions. When exploring ways to increase agricultural production, what various regions urgently need is to study the special laws of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" locally under the guidance of the general laws of the "Eight-Point Charter." Because natural conditions vary greatly, a good seed that is considered to increase production in one place may not necessarily achieve high production increases when moved to another place. This requires commune-run agricultural scientific experimental organizations to arrange research topics in accordance with local production needs and combine them with the broad masses from beginning to end to solve the most pressing problems. Therefore, commune experiment stations must firmly establish the view of serving production. Only in this way can commune experiment stations be continuously consolidated and developed.
    With the drive to do a good job in scientific experiments, there must also be a certain level of cultural knowledge. Therefore, another very important issue in running experiment stations well is that the experiment stations must run spare-time cultural and technical education in combination with production and scientific experiments. The commune members' cultural level cannot keep up with the needs of scientific research activities, which is a prominent contradiction in the current experiment stations. However, there is now a relatively successful experience in solving this contradiction. The Guangxi rural people's commune experiment station's method of combining scientific research, production, and spare-time education published in this newspaper today is a relatively good example. Judging from the current situation, commune experiment stations should combine running schools and cooperate closely with agricultural middle schools to continuously improve the cultural level and professional level of the commune members in the stations. This is a self-reliant method and a method to run the people's commune experiment stations in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This requires commune experiment stations to plan comprehensively, arrange uniformly, grasp both the scientific research closely combined with production and the spare-time cultural education suitable for scientific research, so that agricultural scientific research can be higher than one wave and better serve agricultural production.
    In order to run the commune's agricultural science experiment stations well, various professional research departments should regard supporting and promoting the development of mass agricultural scientific research activities as their glorious task. Various agricultural research units have established many base points in the communes. Whether these base points can be moved into the commune experiment stations and combined with the commune experiment stations, and use their knowledge and technology to help the experiment stations further improve scientific research and run education well, is indeed an important issue that should be considered. We hope it can be resolved.

### 办好农业科学试验场

    办好农业科学试验场
    我国农业科学试验研究已经成为广大农民的群众性活动，以人民公社为基础的全国性的农业科学试验研究网已经基本形成。
    可以看到，随着人民公社制度优越性的发挥和社办农业科学研究活动的进一步开展，我国的农业科学事业，将会以一日千里的速度大踏步的向前发展。同时，由于这些农业科学试验组织有成效的活动，它们已经普遍成为公社因地制宜贯彻农业“八字宪法”的有力助手和参谋，推广科学新成就和作增产示范的基地，培养又红又专的群众性技术队伍的学校。许多农业劳动模范和先进生产者，本来是不识字或识字不多的，就是由于在生产实践中开展科学研究，把多年来的经验提高到理性认识，现在成了中国农业科学院或者省分院（所）的研究员，有的被聘到大学去讲学。
    现在摆在我们面前的任务是，如何百尺竿头更进一步办好人民公社科学试验场，使它在促进农业生产持续跃进的工作中，发挥出更大的作用。
    根据广西僮族自治区的经验，除了加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅以外，办好公社试验场必须抓住以搞好生产为基础，以试验研究为主导，积极地培养初级农业技术人材三个方面。换句话说，就是公社试验研究组织要贯彻执行科学研究、生产劳动和文化教育三结合的方针。
    科学发展的历史告诉我们，生产发展是推动科学前进的根本动力，离开了生产，科学是不能真正有所发展的。广西各地公社试验场由于紧密结合当地生产中的关键问题开展研究活动，因此得到领导的支持和群众的欢迎，党委称它是参谋助手，社员说它是良师益友，办得有声有色，而且愈办愈好。如果脱离生产，孤立地搞试验，是搞不出什么名堂来的，试验场也注定办不好。我们现在虽然有了农业“八字宪法”作为农业生产的指导，但是我国地区辽阔，各地情况不同，在探索农业增产的途径时，各地迫切需要的是在“八字宪法”一般规律指导下，研究当地贯彻“八字宪法”的特殊规律。因为自然条件千差万别，此地认为是增产的良种移到彼地就不一定能获得高额增产。这就要求社办农业科学试验组织必须针对当地生产需要安排研究课题，自始至终与广大群众相结合，解决当前最迫切的问题。因此，公社试验场必须牢固地树立起为生产服务的观点，只有这样，公社试验场才能不断巩固和发展。
    有了搞好科学试验的干劲，还要有一定的文化知识水平。因此，办好试验场又一个很重要的问题，就是试验场要结合生产和科学试验来办好业余文化技术教育。社员文化水平赶不上科学研究活动的需要，这是当前试验场的一个突出的矛盾。但是，现在已经有了解决这个矛盾的比较成功的经验了。今天本报发表的广西农村人民公社试验场科学研究、生产、业余教育三结合的办法就是一个比较好的典型。从现在的情况看，公社试验场应结合办学校，并与农业中学密切配合，不断提高场内社员的文化水平和业务水平，这样才是自力更生的办法，也是多快好省办好人民公社试验场的办法。这就要求公社试验场全面规划，统一安排，既抓紧密结合生产的科学研究，又抓适合科学研究需要的业余文化教育，使农业科学研究一浪高过一浪，更好地为农业生产服务。
    为了办好公社的农业科学试验场，各专业研究部门应把支援和促进群众性农业科学研究活动的发展作为自己的光荣任务。各农业研究单位都在公社建立了不少基点，是否可以把这些基点搬进公社试验场去，与公社试验场结合起来，利用自己的知识和技术帮助试验场进一步搞好科学研究，办好教育，确是应当考虑的一个重要问题。我们希望能够得到解决。
