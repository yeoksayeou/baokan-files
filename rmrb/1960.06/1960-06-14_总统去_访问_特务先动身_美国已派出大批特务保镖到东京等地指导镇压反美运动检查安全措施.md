Xinhua News Agency, June 13th dispatch from New York: The American magazine "Newsweek," published today, revealed in an article that the United States has sent a large number of special agents and bodyguards to several Asian cities that the U.S. President will soon visit to guide the "local authorities" in suppressing anti-American movements in order to protect Eisenhower's "security."

This American magazine, in an article entitled "A Dangerous Trip to the Orient," admitted that Eisenhower will face "hostile crowds" when he visits the four major Asian cities of Manila, Taipei, Tokyo, and Seoul. It wrote, "Anti-American undercurrents are emerging in Manila, South Korea is boiling, Tokyo is still experiencing large-scale riots against the pro-American Nobusuke Kishi, and for days, students have been marching in front of the American embassy with signs reading 'Ike Go Home'."

"Newsweek" emphasized that "therefore, the responsibility for the (American) President's safety – perhaps the heaviest responsibility ever borne by guards for an individual – falls on the shoulders of secret agents."

It said, "Twenty-five special agents left last week for the areas Eisenhower will visit, and they are the advance party for the forty-five guards who will protect him wherever Eisenhower goes. They are all burly men, mostly college graduates, extremely courteous in appearance, but rigorously trained to use guns and knives very quickly, and to wield their hands and feet."

The article also said that American special agents will make recommendations to the "local authorities" in every Asian city on the U.S. President's itinerary on "security" issues. It said, "They will also check the list: Who is preparing the president's meals? Are there explosives or speakers in his bedroom? Are there any identified madmen to watch out for? Are the manholes, balconies, and roofs along the car's route safe?"

The article also stated that "the White House recently revised its plans and decided to use a cargo plane to transport Eisenhower's Lincoln automobile with a plastic roof to Tokyo. Under the bright, plastic roof of this car, the president can be seen by everyone, but no bullet can hit him."

    总统去“访问”特务先动身
    美国已派出大批特务保镖到东京等地指导镇压反美运动检查安全措施
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：今天出版的美国“新闻周刊”在一篇文章中透露，美国已经派出大批特务保镖到美国总统即将访问的几个亚洲城市指导“地方当局”镇压反美运动以保护艾森豪威尔的“安全”。
    这家美国杂志在一篇题为“危险的东方之行”的文章中承认，艾森豪威尔在即将访问马尼拉、台北、东京和汉城这四个亚洲大城市时，都将面对“抱有敌对情绪的群众”。它写道，“马尼拉涌现反美暗流，南朝鲜在沸腾，东京仍在发生大规模的反对亲美的岸信介的骚乱，好几天来，学生们拿着‘艾克别来’的标语在美国大使馆前游行。”
    “新闻周刊”强调说，“因此，负责（美国）总统安全的责任——也许是卫兵的有史以来对一个个人所负的最重责任——就落在特务人员的身上了。”
    它说，“二十五个特工人员上周已经动身去艾森豪威尔将访问的地区，他们是在艾森豪威尔所到之处保卫他的四十五个卫兵的先行人员。他们都是彪形大汉，大部分是大学毕业生，外表上极其温文有礼，然而却受过严格训练，能够非常迅速地使用枪刀，挥动手足。”
    文章又说，美国特工人员将对列入美国总统访问日程表上的每个亚洲城市的“地方当局”就“保安”问题提出建议。它说，“他们还将检查名单，谁为总统准备伙食？他的卧室里有爆炸物或扩音器吗？有没有任何已被发觉的要加以注意的狂人？汽车将经过之处的地洞口、阳台和屋顶都安全吗？”
    文章还说，“白宫最近修改了计划，决定以运货飞机替艾森豪威尔把塑料制车顶的林肯牌汽车运到东京。在这辆汽车的明亮的、塑料制的车顶之下，总统可以让人人都看到，但是没有一个子弹可以打中他。”
