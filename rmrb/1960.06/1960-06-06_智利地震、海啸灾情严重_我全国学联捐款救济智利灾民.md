Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 3rd: Chile is currently carrying out post-earthquake and tsunami relief work. Since May 21st, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions have occurred continuously. On May 31st and June 1st, earthquakes still occurred in the Concepción province.

According to Chilean Senator A. Rodríguez's estimate during the Senate's disaster debate on the evening of May 31st, the number of people who died in Chile due to the recent series of earthquakes is no less than 10,000. Ten provinces with a population of 2,448,578 people were affected by the disaster. He also said that the affected area is between 36 and 48 degrees latitude. This area originally produced wheat, flour, livestock, timber, steel, coal, textiles, fish, potatoes, and sugar.

The terrain of the affected area has changed, and a group of geologists will depart to redraw Chile's new topographic map.

According to reports, approximately 320 kilometers of coastline in southern Chile, including the coastlines of Valdivia Province and Chiloé Province, has permanently sunk. In areas along the coast of Valdivia, the land has sunk by as much as three meters. The sinking of the land has brought serious consequences. The city of Valdivia has practically become a huge natural port where ships with a displacement of 5,000 tons can dock. In order to avoid new disasters that may be brought about by the current unstable subsoil, cities such as Puerto Montt, Valdivia, and Ancud will be forced to abandon their sites and be rebuilt in new locations.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The All-China Students' Federation today donated RMB 2,500 yuan to the Liaison Committee of Chilean Universities to relieve the Chilean people and students who recently suffered from the earthquake disaster.

After the earthquake occurred in Chile, the Liaison Committee of Chilean Universities sent a telegram to the All-China Students' Federation requesting a donation.

    智利地震、海啸灾情严重
    我全国学联捐款救济智利灾民
    新华社3日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利目前正在进行地震、海啸后的善后救济工作。从5月21日以来，地震、海啸、火山爆发连续发生。5月31日和6月1日，公塞普森省仍有地震。
    据智利参议院议员阿·罗德里格斯5月31日晚在参议院灾情辩论中估计，智利由于最近一系列地震而死亡的人数不下于一万人。人口为二百四十四万八千五百七十八人的十个省受到灾害影响。他还说，受害地区在纬度三十六度到四十八度之间。这个地区原来出产小麦、面粉、牲畜、木材、钢、煤、纺织品、鱼类、马铃薯和糖等物品。
    受害地区的地形已经改变，一批地质学家将出发去重新绘制智利的新地形图。
    据消息说，智利南部大约三百二十公里长的海岸线，包括瓦尔的维亚省和济罗省的海岸线在内已永久下沉。在瓦尔的维亚沿海岸线的地方下沉了三米之多。土地下沉的结果带来了严重的后果。瓦尔的维亚城实际上已经变成一个巨大的天然港口，排水量为五千吨的船只都可以在那里停泊。为了避免因目前下层底土不稳定而可能带来新的灾害，像蒙特港、瓦尔的维亚和安库特等城市将被迫放弃而改建在新的地方。
    新华社4日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天捐助人民币二千五百元给智利大学联络委员会，救济最近遭受地震灾害的智利人民和学生。
    在智利发生地震后，智利大学联络委员会曾打电报给中华全国学生联合会，要求给以捐助。
