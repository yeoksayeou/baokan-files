Xinhua News Agency, 6th—Walter Warnke, Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Free German Trade Union of the German Democratic Republic, stated in a speech at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the afternoon of the 5th that, for German workers, the struggle for peace is, in part, to establish a close alliance between Japanese and German workers to counter the revival of German and Japanese militarism.

He pointed out that American imperialism, which is trying to gather all the reactionary forces in the world around it, is tightly tying West German and Japanese imperialism to the Pentagon through the North Atlantic Treaty and military treaties. These attempts are against the interests of peace and the people of all countries, especially the interests of the Japanese, West German, and American people.

Warnke expressed complete agreement with the report made by Marcel Bras, representing Louis Saillant, at yesterday's meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, and he believes this report "detailed the working class's struggle for peace."

He believes that after the American plane provocations and Eisenhower's statement, striving for complete disarmament and peaceful coexistence became absolutely necessary. Warnke believes that "after the American plane provocations and Eisenhower's statement, further strengthening the struggle for peace, for complete and thorough disarmament, and for peaceful coexistence has become absolutely necessary." He said that therefore, our delegation welcomes with particular satisfaction the new disarmament proposal made by the Soviet government to the governments of all countries two days ago, which is fully in line with the interests of the working class and peace.

Warnke said that the policy of oppression of the people of all countries by Japanese and German militarism is well known. They are now colluding with each other and want to arm themselves with atomic weapons to oppose lasting peace. We are sounding the alarm to workers all over the world, asking them to pay attention to this danger.

He said, we say to our Japanese friends, the Japanese workers: "Let us replace the friendship between German and Japanese militarists, which endangers world peace, with true friendship between Japanese and German workers."

He said that friendly cooperation has been established between the Free German Trade Union Federation and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) for several years. In the three declarations signed successively by representatives of our two federations in November 1956, October 1957, and November 1959, we declared: German and Japanese workers are very hardworking, and this quality should not be used to prepare for atomic war, but should be used to strive for the maintenance of peace and the happiness of workers all over the world. We call on German and Japanese workers to achieve domestic unified action in: (1) opposing the production, testing, and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs; opposing the establishment of military bases and launch pads; (2) opposing militarism; (3) opposing re-militarization and striving for disarmament.

On behalf of the delegation of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Warnke paid tribute to the Japanese working class who are waging selfless and combative struggles for peace and against Japanese militarism.

Warnke said that German militarism first threatens the German Democratic Republic, it wants to oppress the workers of the German Democratic Republic and place them under the exploitation of German monopoly capitalists.

In addition, German imperialism wants to oppress the people of Western Europe and put them under its plans. He pointed out that West German monopoly capital, as in the past, is ready to launch aggression against France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and other countries in order to ensure its rule in Western Europe.

Warnke said that the Bonn government's arms policy has placed unprecedented burdens on West German workers. In West Germany, the entire life is increasingly subject to atomic armament and war preparations.

He said: "If armament is ended, the West German people will not only be able to guarantee lasting peace, but will also be able to save 12 billion marks in military spending each year, and if they can effectively fight to achieve these goals, then the West German people will be able to enjoy an ever-increasing standard of living." He said that our struggle against armament is also a national struggle to safeguard peace and national security of Germany, and a struggle for democracy and social progress.

Warnke pointed out that every blow to militarism is also a blow to American imperialism. He expressed his support for the signing of a peace treaty that can truly subdue German militarism and demanded that West Berlin be transformed into a free, demilitarized city.

He said that Khrushchev defended the cause of peace in Paris, and therefore also defended the interests of the German people. Statements by some American officials openly admitted that American spy planes frequently operated from West German airports, and these planes flew to the East.

Continue to Wage Unremitting Struggle for Socialism, People's Welfare, and Peace

When talking about the brilliant achievements made by the workers of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction and the contributions made by the Free German Trade Union to socialist construction, Warnke said that our workers use competitions aimed at improving labor productivity to realize the national economic plan, thereby also improving their standard of living. Trade unions have made direct contributions to the formulation of laws and orders governing the working and living conditions of the working people. For a long time, we have forgotten what unemployment is, and in industry, the working day is only seven and a half hours.

He said that this is only a small part of our achievements and tasks. We will continue to wage unremitting struggle for socialism, for the people's welfare, and for peace.

He said that every one of our achievements will be a support to the West German working class in their struggle against militarism and for democratic institutions and social progress.

Warnke finally said, "Our answer to the provocations of the American and West German reactionaries who hindered the summit conference is: every action by workers at the machines for the victory of socialism, every extra quintal of grain and meat produced, is a step forward towards eliminating war, consolidates our republic, and brings us closer to a better, more cultured life."

    世界工联副主席自由德国工会主席瓦恩克的发言
    据新华社6日讯　世界工联副主席、德意志民主共和国自由德国工会主席瓦恩克，5日下午在世界工联理事会会议上发言时说，对于德国工人来说，争取和平的斗争，部分地是要在日本和德国工人之间建立紧密的同盟，以对付德国和日本军国主义的复活。
    他指出，力图把世界上一切反动势力集结在其周围的美帝国主义，通过北大西洋公约和军事条约，把西德和日本帝国主义紧紧地拴在五角大楼上。这些企图是违反和平和各国人民的利益的，特别是违反日本、西德和美国人民的利益。
    瓦恩克表示完全同意马赛尔·布拉代表路易·赛扬昨天在世界工联理事会会议上作的报告，他认为这个报告“详细地叙述了工人阶级争取和平的斗争”。
    他认为，美机挑衅和艾森豪威尔发表声明后，争取彻底裁军、争取和平共处就成为绝对必要了瓦恩克认为，“在美国飞机进行挑衅和艾森豪威尔发表声明之后，进一步加强争取和平、争取全面彻底裁军、争取和平共处的斗争，就成为绝对必要的了。”他说，因此，我国代表团以特别满意的心情欢迎苏联政府两天前向各国政府发出的新的裁军建议，这个建议是完全符合工人阶级和和平的利益的。
    瓦恩克说，日本和德国军国主义对各国人民的压迫政策是人所共知的。他们现在互相勾结，要以原子武器武装起来，来反对持久和平。我们向全世界工人发出警报，请他们注意这种危险。
    他说，我们向日本朋友们、日本的工人们这样说：“让我们以日本和德国工人间的真正的友谊，来代替德国和日本军国主义者之间的危及世界和平的友谊。”
    他说，几年来，在自由德国工会联合会和日本总评之间建立了友好合作。由我们两个联合会的代表相继在1956年11月、1957年10月、1959年11月签署的三项声明中，我们宣布：德日两国工人是十分勤劳的，这种品质不应该用在准备原子战争，而应该用来争取维护和平、争取全世界工人的幸福。我们呼吁德日两国工人在：（一）反对生产、试验和使用原子弹和氢弹；反对建立军事基地和发射台；（二）反对军国主义；
    （三）反对重新军国主义化和争取裁军的斗争中实现国内的统一行动。
    瓦恩克以自由德国工会联合会代表团的名义，向正在为争取和平、反对日本军国主义而进行着忘我的、富于战斗性的斗争的日本工人阶级致敬。
    瓦恩克说，德国军国主义首先威胁着德意志民主共和国，它想压迫德意志民主共和国的工人，把他们置于德国垄断资本家的剥削之下。
    另外，德国帝国主义想压迫西欧人民，把他们置于它的计划之中。他指出：西德垄断资本像过去一样，已准备好发动对法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡等国家的侵略，以便保证它在西欧的统治。
    瓦恩克说，波恩政府的军备政策，给西德工人造成了前所未闻的负担。在西德，整个生活都越来越厉害地从属于原子军备和战争准备。
    他说：“如果结束军备的话，西德人民就不仅能保证得到持久和平，而且每年有可能节省一百二十亿马克的军事预算，并且，如果能够有效地为争取实现这些目标而斗争，那么西德人民就能享受日益提高的生活水平”。他说，我们反对军备的斗争，同时也是为了保障和平、保障德国国家安全的民族斗争，为了民主和社会进步的斗争。
    瓦恩克指出，对军国主义的每一次打击，同时也是对美帝国主义的打击。他表示赞成签订真正能够制服德国军国主义的和约，并要求把西柏林改变为自由的非军事化的城市。
    他说，赫鲁晓夫在巴黎保卫了和平的事业，因而也就保卫了德国人民的利益。一些美国官员的声明公开承认了美国的间谍飞机从西德的机场出发经常进行活动，这些飞机是向东方飞的。
    继续为社会主义、为人民福利和和平进行不懈的斗争
    在谈到德意志民主共和国工人在社会主义建设中创造的光辉成就，以及自由德国工会对社会主义建设作出的贡献时，瓦恩克说，我国工人用旨在提高劳动生产率的竞赛来实现国民经济计划，从而也提高着他们的生活水平。在制定劳动人民工作与生活条件的法律和命令方面，工会作出了直接贡献。长久以来，我们已经忘了失业是什么东西，在工业中，工作日只有七个半小时。
    他说，这仅是我们成就和任务中微小的一部分。我们将继续为社会主义、为人民的福利和和平进行不懈的斗争。
    他说，我们的每一个成绩，对西德的工人阶级反对军国主义、争取民主制度和社会进步的斗争都将是支持。
    瓦恩克最后说，“对阻碍首脑会议的美国和西德反动派的挑衅，我们的回答是：工人为了社会主义胜利在机器旁的每一动作，超额生产出的每一公担粮食和肉，都是向消灭战争前进一步，都巩固我们的共和国，并使我们迅速地接近更加美好的、有更高文化水平的生活。”
