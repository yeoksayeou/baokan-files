Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The World Federation of Trade Unions Council continued its meeting this morning. The just appeals from trade union representatives from colonial and semi-colonial countries and regions demonstrate that colonial people under imperialist rule cannot discuss "peaceful coexistence" with imperialism.

    Belarmino, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Portuguese Guinea, spoke about the tragic lives of the people of Portuguese Guinea, who have been ruled by Portuguese colonialism for five centuries. He said that their people have suffered long-term famine and extreme poverty under the cruel rule of the colonialists, their civil rights have never been realized, and in particular, the shameful practice of lynching used by the colonialists is appalling.

    He appealed to the trade union representatives attending the meeting, hoping that they would mobilize the power of the people of various countries to help them eradicate the darkest rule in Portuguese Guinea. He said, can you remain indifferent to the calls of the colonial people?

    African People in Final Decisive Battle Against Imperialism and Colonialism
    Trade union representatives from the Ivory Coast and Equatorial Africa condemned the crimes of the colonialists in their speeches. They issued a unanimous call for independence and for the overthrow of colonialism. Blaise, a trade union representative from the Ivory Coast, which is subjected to French colonialism and its lackeys' fascist rule, said that Africa today has become the last stronghold of imperialism and colonialism, and the struggle of the African people is the final decisive battle against imperialism and colonialism. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions should take anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism as its fundamental program of action, and it should devote all its strength to supporting the struggle of the African people against the evil colonial rule. Blaise said that he wanted to remind the World Federation of Trade Unions Council to pay attention to the increasingly broad tendency of past conferences, which only produced "theoretical" resolutions that lacked practical effect. He believed that this meeting would produce practical and concrete resolutions that would enable the entire working class and the working masses of the world to fight against international imperialism and colonialism, and to liberate the African people from the injustice, disaster, and cruelty caused by imperialism and colonialism. He said that the African people know that their cause is just and that they will surely achieve victory. We are more optimistic than before, and we have seen the fate of such fellows as Syngman Rhee and Menderes.

    Danga Paul, General Secretary of the Ubangi-Shari-Bangui Local Union of the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Equatorial Africa, spoke to expose the French colonial rule over Ubangi-Shari and the tragic lives of the people. He said that in Ubangi-Shari, trade union rights are violated, and many trade union leaders are arrested and imprisoned by the authorities, but the people have not been intimidated, and they are continuing to fight for the abolition of the colonial system and the struggle for national liberation.

    He said, we oppose de Gaulle's "French Community," and we demand national independence.

    Finally, he shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with colonialism!" "U.S. imperialism and colonialism get out of Africa!" "Africa is Africa for Africans!" "Long live proletarian internationalism!"
   "ICFTU" is a hired organization to maintain the rule of U.S. imperialism. Special guest Damber, Executive Committee Member of the Ghana Trades Union Congress, revealed the conspiracy of the "ICFTU" controlled by U.S. imperialism to undermine the unity of African workers in his speech. He said that the "ICFTU" has proven to be an enemy of the African liberation movement and an agent of imperialism and colonialism, a hired organization to maintain the rule of U.S. imperialism in the world today.

    Damber finally shouted "Down with imperialism and colonialism!" along with all the representatives.

    Bendura Vanegas, General Secretary of the Colombian Workers' Confederation, thoroughly exposed the brutal attacks launched by U.S. imperialism against the Colombian workers and people through military treaties, economic aggression, and even espionage activities in his speech.

    Vanegas pointed out that we must be vigilant against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. He mentioned the recent visit of the President of Colombia to the United States. After this, the United States publicized that it would carry out a so-called "suitable" land reform in Colombia that was in direct opposition to the Cuban revolution, and Colombian newspapers, radio stations, and churches also launched a large-scale anti-Cuban propaganda campaign. Vanegas said, but the Colombian people do not agree with the President's attitude, we want to stop this conspiracy, and we have friends in Cuba in our country.

    He said that the people's democratic movement in Colombia has now begun to organize joint actions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals to fight for the abolition of the U.S.-Colombia military assistance treaty.

    The Current Era is One of Socialist Victory and National Independence Struggle Victory
    Loberto Antonio Laha Olate, Executive Committee Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Secretary of Labor-Management Mediation of the Chilean Unified Trade Union, pointed out in his speech that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the people of the world. He said that at present, in Chile and in Latin America, the anti-U.S. imperialist sentiment is unprecedentedly high. Police measures cannot stop the Latin American people from openly expressing their contempt and indignation towards U.S. imperialism during Nixon's visit to South America in 1958 and during Eisenhower's recent visit.

    Olate emphasized that the current era is one of socialist victory and one of national independence struggle victory. It is inevitable that Latin American countries will be liberated from imperialist rule. He affirmed that the road to liberation from U.S. imperialist control has been opened, and the Latin American people realize that they must take the path of Cuba to achieve true liberation.

    Olate exposed that the Latin American Workers' Regional Organization controlled by the U.S. State Department is doing its utmost to obstruct the unity of Latin American workers, conspiring to convene a Pan-American trade union conference, promoting so-called "class cooperation," and buying and supporting trade union cadres who are subordinate to the United States. He asked the World Federation of Trade Unions to support their struggle.

    Special guest Justino Jose del Orbe of the Dominican Republic said in his speech that the Dominican Republic is a semi-colony of U.S. imperialism. U.S. capital controls the important production sectors and foreign trade of the Dominican Republic such as sugar, bananas, and iron. The Trujillo terrorist dictatorship, which represents the interests of pro-imperialist landlords and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, has carried out brutal suppression of the people's just resistance. He said that despite facing the bloody suppression of the army, Dominican workers have still struggled to improve their living conditions, especially the sugar workers, who have also held significant strike movements. He pointed out that Dominican workers support the movement launched by Cuban and Venezuelan workers to boycott the Dominican dictatorship. He said that any support for the anti-dictatorship struggle is support for the cause of peace and progress. He asked the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting to decide to take measures to support this movement.

    George Hare, Secretary of the Lebanese Hotel Workers' Union, said in his speech that after the Four-Power Summit Conference was sabotaged by the provocative actions of the United States, a protest movement involving a wide range of classes was launched in Lebanon. Statements issued by all sectors unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism, pointing out that it should bear full responsibility for the failure of the summit conference.

    Hare said that after the struggle against U.S. imperialist interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, the Lebanese people are fighting for national unity, consolidation of sovereignty and independence, and the implementation of a neutral policy. They advocate developing the national economy to free it from dependence on foreign countries and oppose imperialist "aid." He said that Lebanese workers have emerged as a political force in the struggle.

    Delegertsungnai Barginyam, Chairman of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions, said in his speech that Mongolian workers and people strongly condemned the U.S. war provocations and sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, and demanded that this Council meeting pass a declaration condemning the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism and calling on workers of all countries to struggle to implement the resolution on disarmament of the 20th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    He believes that when imperialism is stepping up its war provocations, workers all over the world face serious tasks and must strengthen unity.

    The Attitude and Nature of Imperialism Will Not Change, and the Working Class of All Countries Must Strengthen Vigilance
    Janos Bruzcho, General Secretary of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions, emphasized in his speech that according to the Hungarian people's own experience, U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the international working class and the main enemy against lasting peace and progress in the world.

    Bruzcho then emphasized that the attitude and nature of imperialism will not change, and the working class of all countries must strengthen vigilance. Waiting for monopoly capital and arms merchants to ease the situation is tantamount to asking them to reduce profits, which is just a fantasy. At present, the U.S. government and the Bonn government support monopoly capital and arms merchants, and the policies of these countries are determined by armament.

    Bruzcho said that the situation is constantly developing in a direction that is beneficial to peace and socialism. The Soviet Union has made great achievements in science, technology, and economic construction, the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is booming, and the struggle to defend peace has also had great development.

    In his speech, Bruzcho expressed his complete agreement with the content of the report made by the Executive Committee at the Council meeting.

    Otto Hornell, a member of the Central Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. He said that U.S. imperialism is reviving West German militarism, and West German militarism has once again become a threat to the people of the world.

    After exposing the penetration of West German monopoly capital into Austria, he said that this penetration not only threatens Austria's independence but also attempts to guide Austria economically, politically, and militarily to the position of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    He said that China is an increasingly powerful factor in ensuring world peace, and for those colonial countries and people who have not yet achieved independence, China is a guarantee of their victory.

    许多国家工会代表在世界工联理事会议上的发言说明
    被压迫人民同帝国主义不能“和平共处”
    据新华社7日讯　世界工联理事会今天上午继续举行会议。来自殖民地半殖民地国家和地区的工会代表所发出的正义呼声表明，在帝国主义统治下的殖民地人民，是无法同帝国主义谈论“和平共处”的。
    葡属几内亚总工会总书记贝拉尔明诺在发言中，谈到被葡萄牙殖民主义者统治了五个世纪的葡属几内亚人民十分悲惨的生活。他说，他们的人民在殖民主义者惨酷统治下，长期发生饥荒，生活十分贫困，公民权利从未实现过，特别是殖民主义者使用的可耻的私刑，更是骇人听闻。
    他向到会的各国工会代表呼吁，希望他们动员各国人民的力量，帮助他们铲除在葡属几内亚的最黑暗的统治。他说，难道你们能对殖民地人民的呼声无动于衷吗？
    非洲人民同帝国主义和殖民主义作最后决战
    象牙海岸和赤道非洲的工会代表在发言中，都谴责了殖民主义者的罪行，他们发出一致的呼声，要求独立，要求打倒殖民主义。受到法国殖民主义和它的走狗法西斯统治的象牙海岸的工会代表布莱斯说，非洲今天已成为帝国主义和殖民主义的最后据点，非洲人民的斗争，是同帝国主义和殖民主义的最后决战。他说，世界工联应当把反帝反殖民主义作为它根本性的行动纲领，它应该在支援非洲人民反对罪恶殖民统治的斗争中拿出自己的全部力量。布莱斯说，他希望提醒世界工联理事会注意到越来越广泛的历次大会上的倾向，在这些大会只产生“理论”性的缺乏实际效果的决议。他相信这次会议将产生实际具体的决议，这些决议将使整个工人阶级和全世界的劳动大众对国际帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争，使非洲人民从帝国主义和殖民主义所造成的非正义、灾难和残酷生活中解放出来。他说，非洲人民知道自己的事业是正义的，是一定能够取得胜利的。我们比从前更为乐观，我们看到了李承晚、曼德列斯等家伙们的下场。
    赤道非洲总工会乌班吉沙立邦吉地方工会总书记丹加·保尔发言揭露了法国对乌班吉沙立的殖民统治，和人民的悲惨生活。他说，在乌班吉沙立工会权利受到侵犯，许多工会领袖被当局逮捕监禁，但人民并没有被吓倒，他们正在继续为取消殖民主义制度，争取民族解放而斗争。
    他说，我们反对戴高乐的“法兰西共同体”，我们要求民族独立。
    最后他高呼，“打倒美帝国主义”，“打倒殖民主义”，“美帝国主义、殖民主义从非洲滚出去”，“非洲是非洲人的非洲”，“无产阶级国际主义万岁”。
   “自由工联”是维持美帝国主义统治的御用组织特邀代表加纳工会大会执行委员丹姆贝尔在发言中揭露了美帝国主义控制的“自由工联”破坏非洲工人团结的阴谋活动。他说，“自由工联”已经证明它是非洲解放运动的敌人和帝国主义、殖民主义的代理人，是维持美帝国主义今天在世界的统治的一个御用组织。
    丹姆贝尔最后和全场代表一起，高呼“打倒帝国主义和殖民主义”！
    哥伦比亚工人联合会总书记本杜拉·伐涅加斯的发言，彻底揭露了美帝国主义通过军事条约、经济侵略以至特务活动对哥伦比亚工人和人民进行的横暴的进攻。
    伐涅加斯指出，必须警惕和平敌人的阴谋。他提到哥伦比亚总统不久前到美国的访问。在这之后，美国就宣传要在哥伦比亚搞一个与古巴革命针锋相对的所谓“合适”的土改，哥伦比亚的报刊、电台、教会也展开了大规模的反古巴宣传。伐涅加斯说，但是哥伦比亚人民不赞成总统的这种态度，我们要阻止这个阴谋，在我们国家里有着古巴的朋友。
    他说，目前哥伦比亚的人民的、民主的运动已经开始了组织工人、农民和知识分子的共同行动以取消美国——哥伦比亚军援条约的斗争。
    目前是社会主义胜利和民族独立斗争胜利的时代
    世界工联执委、智利统一工会劳资调解书记洛泊尔多·安东尼奥·拉哈·奥拉特在发言中指出，美帝国主义是世界人民的主要敌人。他说，目前在智利、在拉丁美洲，反对美帝国主义的情绪空前高涨。警察措施也阻挡不了拉丁美洲人民在1958年尼克松访问南美、和最近艾森豪威尔访问时公开表示他们对美帝国主义的鄙视和愤慨。
    奥拉特强调说，目前的时代是社会主义胜利的时代，是民族独立斗争胜利的时代。拉丁美洲国家从帝国主义统治下解放出来是必不可免的。他肯定地说，从美帝国主义控制下解放出来的道路已经打开，拉丁美洲人民认识到必须走古巴的道路才能得到真正的解放。
    奥拉特揭露美国国务院控制下的拉丁美洲工人区域组织，正竭力阻挠拉丁美洲工人的团结，阴谋召开泛美工会会议、宣传所谓“阶级合作”、收买与扶植屈从于美国的工会干部。他要求世界工联支援他们的斗争。
    特邀代表、多米尼加的胡斯底诺·何塞·德尔奥尔贝在发言中说，多米尼加是美帝国主义的一个半殖民地。美国资本控制了多米尼加的糖、香蕉、铁等重要生产部门和对外贸易。代表亲帝国主义的大地主和官僚资产阶级利益的特鲁希略恐怖独裁政权，对人民的正当反抗进行了残暴的镇压。他说，尽管面临着军队的血腥镇压，多米尼加工人依然为改善生活条件进行了斗争，特别是糖业工人，还举行了意义重大的罢工运动。他指出，多米尼加工人支持古巴和委内瑞拉工人发起的抵制多米尼加独裁政权的运动。他说，任何对反独裁斗争的支持都是对和平和进步事业的支持。他要求世界工联理事会会议决定采取措施支持这个运动。
    黎巴嫩旅馆业工人工会书记乔治·哈雷在发言中说，四国首脑会议被美国的挑衅行动破坏以后，在黎巴嫩展开了一个有广泛阶层参加的抗议运动。各界发表的声明一致谴责美帝国主义，指出它应对首脑会议的失败负完全的责任。
    哈雷说，黎巴嫩人民继反对美帝国主义干涉黎巴嫩内政的斗争以后，正在为民族团结、巩固主权和独立以及执行中立政策而斗争。他们主张发展民族经济，使它摆脱对外国的依赖，反对帝国主义的“援助”。他说，黎巴嫩工人已作为一股政治力量在斗争中出现。
    蒙古工会中央理事会主席德勒格尔忠奈·巴尔吉尼雅姆发言中说，蒙古工人和人民强烈谴责美国的战争挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议，要求这次理事会议通过宣言，谴责美帝的侵略政策，号召各国工人为实现世界工联执委会第二十次会议有关裁军的决议而斗争。
    他认为，当帝国主义加紧战争挑衅的时候，全世界工人面临着严重的任务，必须加强团结。
    帝国主义的态度和本性不会改变，各国工人阶级必须加强警惕
    匈牙利工会中央理事会总书记亚诺什·布鲁乔在发言中强调指出，根据匈牙利人民自己的经验，美帝国主义是国际工人阶级的第一号敌人，是反对世界持久和平和进步的主要的敌人。
    布鲁乔接着强调说，帝国主义的态度和本性是不会改变的，各国工人阶级必须加强警惕。等待垄断资本和军火商人缓和局势就等于要他们降低利润，这只是幻想。目前美国政府和波恩政府支持垄断资本和军火商人，这些国家的政策是由军备决定的。
    布鲁乔说，局势正向着有利于和平和社会主义方面不断发展。苏联科学技术和经济建设方面获得巨大胜利，亚、非、拉丁美洲民族解放运动蓬勃地发展，保卫和平斗争也有着巨大的发展。
    布鲁乔在发言中表示完全同意执委会在理事会会议上所作报告的内容。
    奥地利工会联合会中央委员会委员奥托·霍恩尔发言时指出，美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人。他说，美帝国主义正在复活西德军国主义，西德军国主义已重新成为对全世界人民的一个威胁。
    他在揭露西德垄断资本向奥地利渗透后说，这种渗透不仅威胁奥地利的独立，而且企图从经济上、政治上和军事上把奥地利引导到北大西洋公约组织的立场上去。
    他说中国是保障世界和平的日益强大的因素，对那些还没有取得独立的殖民地国家和人民来说，中国是他们取得胜利的保障。
