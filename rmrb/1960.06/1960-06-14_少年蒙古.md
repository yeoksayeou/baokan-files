    Young Mongolia
    Lin Boqu's posthumous work
        First poem:
        Mountains embrace a river, the city of Ulaanbaatar is so beautiful; spring fills the new land, and everything is revived. The lingering custom of horse racing always makes one energetic, and skilled eagle shooters have a promising future. Young pines grow naturally, flourishing on the sunny side; fine grasses grow abundantly in the Gobi Desert. Talking about history in the Mongolian yurt, the master and slave relationship has been lost for farmers and herdsmen.
          Second poem:
        Looking through the clear dawn, I couldn't sleep soundly, but the rooster has already crowed, taking the lead. Following the elders in great undertakings, heroic ambition always yearns for youthful years. A full life requires vitality, and harmonious musical tones rely on the main string. Building a foundation is precisely for grand and far-reaching plans, and the truth has never been overturned.
    [Editor's Note] Comrade Lin Boqu's posthumous work from his visit to Mongolia was written during his visit to Mongolia in August 1959, when Comrade Lin led the delegation of the National People's Congress. Comrade Chen Yi copied and sent it to this newspaper, which is specially published for readers to read.

    少年蒙古
    林伯渠遗作
        其　一山环一水太丽都，春满新邦万象苏。跑马余风总作健，射雕能手有前途。稚松自长背阳茂，戈壁丛生细草腴。蒙古包中话沿革，牧农已失主和奴。
          其　二望澈曙光苦未眠，却已鸡鸣步独先。伟业相将随老大，雄心终是思华年。充分生活需维达，协调宫音赖主弦。建基正为谋宏远，真理从来破不颠。
    〔编者注〕林伯渠同志访蒙古遗作，系1959年8月林老率领全国人民代表大会代表团访蒙期间所作。顷由陈毅同志抄寄本报，特刊登以供读者阅读。
