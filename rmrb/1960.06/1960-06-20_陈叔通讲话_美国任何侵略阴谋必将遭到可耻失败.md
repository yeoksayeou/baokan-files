Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Chen Shutong said at the rally of democratic parties and non-party democrats against U.S. imperialist aggression on the 18th that butcher Eisenhower's so-called "visit" to Taiwan is a malicious conspiracy by U.S. imperialism, disregarding world opinion after flagrantly sabotaging the four-power summit, in order to further promote its policy of aggressive war, create tension in the Far East, intensify its military aggression deployment against China and the Soviet Union, and attempt to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan.

He said that U.S. imperialism has always played the trick of false peace and real war preparations, attempting to paralyze the world people's will to resist aggression and strive for independence and freedom, in order to achieve its despicable goal of further enslaving the people of the world. Since sabotaging the four-power summit, all the disguises of U.S. imperialism have been completely torn off, and Eisenhower's ferocious face has been fully exposed. Under the occupation of U.S. imperialism, Taiwan is experiencing rural bankruptcy, industrial depression, and the people's lives have no guarantee, and has become a gloomy and terrifying hell on earth. The Chinese people will never allow the U.S. imperialists to occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan for a long time, and the Taiwan compatriots will never tolerate the long-term cruel trampling by the U.S. imperialists. The Chinese people have long solemnly declared: Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country, and the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and U.S. imperialism has no right to interfere. Our people across the country express unparalleled indignation at butcher Eisenhower's conspiracy to "visit" Taiwan, and we firmly oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Chen Shutong finally said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have completely sufficient strength to smash all the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. The heroic Taiwan compatriots will surely be able to break the shackles of the U.S. imperialism and return to the embrace of the motherland. In the face of the increasingly high tide of just struggle of the people of all countries, Eisenhower has become a rat running across the street, and everyone shouts to beat him. U.S. imperialism is becoming more and more isolated. Any conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to invade China will be shamefully defeated. Victory will surely belong to the Chinese people!

    陈叔通讲话
    美国任何侵略阴谋必将遭到可耻失败
    新华社19日讯　陈叔通18日在各民主党派和无党派民主人士反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，屠夫艾森豪威尔所谓“访问”台湾，是美帝国主义在不顾世界舆论，悍然破坏四国首脑会议之后，为了进一步推行侵略战争政策，制造远东紧张局势，加紧以中苏两国为敌的军事侵略部署，妄图制造“两个中国”，永远侵占我国神圣领土台湾的恶毒阴谋。
    他说，美帝国主义一贯玩弄假和平、真备战的手法，妄图麻痹世界人民反抗侵略、争取独立自由的斗志，以达到它进一步奴役全世界人民的卑鄙目的。自从破坏了四国首脑会议以后，美帝国主义的一切伪装完全撕毁，艾森豪威尔的狰狞面目已经毕露。台湾在美帝国主义侵占下，农村破产，工业萧条，人民生命毫无保障，已经变成一座阴森可怖的人间地狱。中国人民决不能允许美帝长期侵占我国神圣领土台湾，台湾同胞也决不能容忍美帝长期的残酷蹂躏。中国人民早已庄严地宣告：台湾是我国不可分割的一部分，台湾问题是我国的内政问题，美帝国主义无权干涉。我们全国人民对于屠夫艾森豪威尔的“访”台阴谋，表示无比的愤慨，我们坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    陈叔通最后说，在中国共产党领导下，我国人民有完全足够的力量，能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。英勇的台湾同胞一定能够打烂美帝的枷锁，回到祖国的怀抱。在各国人民越来越高涨的正义斗争面前，艾森豪威尔已经成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。美帝国主义越来越孤立了。美帝国主义任何侵略中国的阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。胜利是一定属于中国人民的！
