Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Taipei News - In recent days, the invading American military and political personnel and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have been in a chaotic frenzy "welcoming" Eisenhower. They are stepping up efforts to "rectify the appearance of the city" and implement so-called "security measures" in Keelung and Taipei, causing tens of thousands of residents to suffer before the "plague god" Eisenhower arrives.

According to reports from Taipei's "United Daily News" and Taiwan's "New Life Daily," a group of American secret agents arrived in Taipei on the 8th of this month to confer with the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, and the intelligence agencies of the U.S. "Embassy" in Taiwan regarding "security" issues during Eisenhower's stay in Taiwan. They are also in close contact with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's police and secret service agencies. Under American deployment, Taipei and Keelung have seen "sudden inspections" and "nighttime household registration checks" and other police measures in recent days. Some residents have been labeled with the so-called "crime" of being "suspicious elements" and arrested.

The so-called "rectification of the city's appearance" work, planned by the United States, mainly involves the forced demolition of many shanties and wooden houses of the poor in Keelung and Taipei, so as not to obstruct Eisenhower's "view." In the past half-month, a large number of houses in the slums along the route from Songshan Airport to Dunhua Road, Nanjing East Road, and Zhongshan North Road in Taipei have been demolished, leaving thousands of poor people homeless. This route is the one Eisenhower will take when he arrives in Taipei. At the same time, the United States also notified the Chiang Kai-shek clique to order the police authorities to step up the "crackdown on street vendors." Street vendors in Renai District in downtown Keelung have been driven away since June 1st, and street vendors on Nanjing East Road and Zhongshan North Road in Taipei have also been prohibited from selling goods, and their stalls have been forcibly dismantled. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of street vendors in Keelung and Taipei, who rely on meager profits to support their families, have been greatly affected as a result, and many have been driven to desperation. Homeless people and beggars sleeping on the streets of Keelung and Taipei have also been successively driven away by the police in recent days, or forcibly escorted out of these two cities by large trucks and sent to other remote areas of Taiwan.

    瘟神艾森豪威尔到台前夕
    基隆、台北市民遭殃
    新华社17日讯　台北消息：连日以来，侵台美国军政人员和蒋介石集团都为“迎接”艾森豪威尔而乱作一团，他们加紧在基隆、台北两市“整顿市容”和采取所谓“安全措施”，使成千上万的市民在“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到达前已经遭殃。
    据台北市“联合报”，台湾“新生报”消息，一批美国特务在本月8日就到台北与侵台美军司令部、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团和美国驻台湾“大使”馆的情报机构会商艾森豪威尔在台湾期间的“安全”问题，并且与蒋介石集团的警察、特务机构密切联系。在美国的部署下，台北、基隆两市连日都有“突击检查”、“夜间户口检查”等警察措施，一些市民被加上所谓“可疑分子”的“罪名”受到逮捕。
    美国策划的所谓“整顿市容”工作，主要是把基隆、台北两市的许多贫民竹棚、木屋强迫拆除，以免有碍艾森豪威尔的“观瞻”，半个月来，台北市从松山飞机场到敦化路、南京东路、中山北路两旁的贫民窟的房屋大量被拆，使成千贫民无家可归，这条路线就是艾森豪威尔到台北时经过的地方。与此同时，美国还通知蒋介石集团下令警察当局加紧“取缔摊贩”。基隆市中心仁爱区的摊贩从6月1日起都被赶走，台北市南京东路、中山北路的摊贩也被禁止摆卖商品，并且把摊棚强行拆去。基隆、台北两市数以万计的靠蝇头小利养家活口的摊贩生活因此大受影响，许多人陷入绝境。基隆、台北两市露宿街头的流浪汉和乞丐，连日也纷纷被警察驱逐，或用大卡车强迫押解离开这两个城市，送往台湾其他偏僻地区。
