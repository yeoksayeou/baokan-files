    Garment Industry Workers Innovate, Fabric Store Clerks Learn Tailoring
    Shanghai Widely Promotes Advanced Tailoring Methods
    Garment industry workers in Shanghai have broken with the long-standing conventions of fabric consumption for clothing, such as “15 chi for men, 14 chi for women, and 7 chi for children aged six,” and have created more than three thousand advanced tailoring methods. After evaluation by various districts and the Municipal Garment, Shoes, and Hats Company, 266 of these methods have been prioritized for promotion. These advanced tailoring methods involve precise calculations and clever arrangements, piecing together large and small clothing pieces edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner, like a tangram, ensuring no scrap is wasted. By adopting these methods, while guaranteeing quality and unchanged specifications, the fabric consumption for a medium-sized Zhongshan suit has decreased from 15 chi to 12 chi, and for a men's shirt, from 7.5 chi to 6.4 chi.
    Currently, the vast number of workers in Shanghai's garment industry are actively promoting these advanced tailoring methods. At the same time, they are closely collaborating with cotton fabric stores to teach these methods to sales clerks. In Yangpu District alone, more than 4,200 garments were processed in half a month, saving more than 1,200 chi of cotton fabric. While focusing on saving cotton fabric, efforts are also being made to improve service quality, ensuring that clothing styles and specifications meet the requirements of practicality, comfort, and aesthetics, thereby gaining popularity among consumers.

    服装业职工搞革新  布店营业员学裁剪
    上海广泛推行先进剪裁法
    上海市服装业职工打破了多年来“男十五、女十四、六岁儿童用七尺”的服装用料陈规，创造了三千多种先进裁剪方法，经各区及市服装鞋帽公司的鉴定，着重推广的有二百六十六种。这些先进裁剪法，计算精密，巧排套裁，把大小衣片边对边、角对角，拼得像七巧板一样，做到分寸不丢。采用这些方法裁剪，在保证质量，规格不变的前提下，做一套中号中山装从十五尺下降到十二尺，做一件男式衬衫，从七尺半下降到六尺四寸。
    目前，上海服装行业的广大职工，正在积极推广这些先进裁剪方法。同时，并和棉布店紧密协作，把这些方法教给营业员。单是杨浦区一个区，在半个月内，加工四千二百多件衣服，节约了棉布一千二百多尺。在注意节约棉布的同时，还力求提高服务质量，使服装式样、规格都达到实用、舒适、美观的要求，因而受到消费者的欢迎。
