Grand Rally in the Capital Warmly Welcomes Chairman Leshi
Mayor Peng Zhen said that further exposing the essence of U.S. imperialism and opposing its policies of aggression and war is an urgent task for the people of the world.
Chairman Leshi said that the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the unity and cohesion of the socialist camp should be defended as protecting the eyes.
Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon to warmly welcome Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and all the distinguished Albanian guests.

The magnificent Great Hall of the People was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and joy. The national flags of China and Albania were hung side by side on the central curtain of the rostrum. At 3:15 p.m., Chairman Haxhi Lleshi and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, Mayor Peng Zhen and other leaders, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, the military band played a welcoming march, and the entire audience stood up and burst into thunderous applause.

Also seated on the rostrum were Liri Belishova, Member of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Secretary of the Secretariat; Lefter Goga, Vice-Chairman of the People's Assembly; Vasil Nathanaili, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Piro Pirovs, Albanian Ambassador to China; Nushi, head of the delegation of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania, who is currently in Beijing; Blemti, head of the delegation of the Albanian Labor Youth League, and others.

A group of Young Pioneers ran onto the rostrum and presented flowers to all the distinguished guests.

The welcoming rally began with the solemn playing of the national anthems of Albania and China.

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the beginning of the welcoming rally, extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of all the people of Beijing. He spoke of Albania's construction achievements and its peaceful foreign policy. He pointed out that the Albanian people have always been loyal to proletarian internationalism and have resolutely defended the great unity among the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Albanian Labor Party and the people, in order to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, have consistently waged an irreconcilable struggle against Yugoslav modern revisionism. The Chinese people sincerely admire the high degree of revolutionary principle and strong fighting will demonstrated by the Albanian people in the struggle against modern revisionism.

Mayor Peng Zhen said: "At present, the people of the world are facing the urgent task of further exposing the essence of U.S. imperialism, opposing its policies of aggression and war, and safeguarding world peace. After destroying the four-nation summit conference, U.S. imperialism, despite talking a lot about so-called 'peace efforts' and expressing its willingness to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union, is actually creating tension everywhere and frantically stepping up its arms race and war preparations." He cited a series of facts to prove that "U.S. imperialism is continuing to use double-dealing tactics, continuing to use the guise of 'peace' to wash away its guilt for destroying the four-nation summit conference, and to cover up its further activities of aggression and expansion." He said: "This is something that the people of the world should be highly vigilant about."

Mayor Peng Zhen rebuked the Tito clique for deliberately distorting facts, confusing right and wrong, and for its slavish face in defending its American masters. He said: The Tito clique's actions not only cannot help U.S. imperialism and its boss Eisenhower, but also once again expose that the Tito clique is completely the most loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that the nature of U.S. imperialism will absolutely not change. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and also the best teacher by negative example for the people of the world. It constantly promotes the awakening and unity of the people of the world with its aggressive actions. The result of U.S. imperialism's insistence on war and aggression policies can only lead to the opposite of its wishes. This is the inevitable law of historical development, and no force can change it.

Mayor Peng Zhen said: "Our socialist camp has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and that international disputes should be resolved through negotiations rather than resorting to force. Our position is firm and unwavering. However, countless experiences tell us that the achievement of world peace must mainly rely on the struggle of the people of the world, and we must not harbor unrealistic illusions about imperialism."

Mayor Peng Zhen said: China and Albania are close brothers in the socialist family. "The friendship between our two peoples will continue to be consolidated and developed. Let us join hands more closely, encourage each other, and advance victoriously towards our common goal."

When Mayor Peng Zhen invited Chairman Leshi to speak, thunderous applause shook the meeting hall for a long time. Chairman Leshi warmly praised the socialist construction of China and Albania. He said: "All our common victories and achievements show the indisputable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system and the great power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Chairman Leshi said: "The current international situation shows that the balance of power in the world is favorable to socialism, that the socialist system is infinitely superior to the capitalist system, and that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become an indestructible pillar of peace and freedom for the people of all countries." He pointed out: "Imperialism is trying its best to adopt new means to intensify international tensions, oppose peaceful coexistence, and hinder the solution of pending issues." He condemned the aggressive actions and criminal policies of the United States in sending spy planes to violate Soviet airspace.

He said: "The espionage and sabotage policies of U.S. imperialism threaten the national sovereignty and freedom of all countries. Therefore, our entire socialist camp and all progressive forces in the world unanimously condemn this despicable act of the U.S. government and fully support the correct position of the Soviet Union."

He said: "Although the American imperialists have answered the Soviet Union's peaceful policy with aggression and provocation, our peoples will continue to struggle for the peaceful resolution of pending issues."

Chairman Leshi said: "The main danger of the international workers' movement and the communist movement remains right-wing opportunism and revisionism." "The despicable mission of Yugoslav revisionism, acting on the orders of imperialism to 'breach the fortress from within' to split our socialist camp, has been and will continue to be defeated. The socialist family headed by the Soviet Union is unbreakable. It is more united than ever before. No force can split our unity, because our friendship and unity are required by life and have become an objective historical necessity."

Chairman Leshi said that Albania and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers and vast oceans, but the correct policies of our Marxist-Leninist parties have forever eliminated this distance and obstacles. Our friendship has taken root and sprouted in the hearts of our two peoples who are fighting for socialism and communism. They will always maintain vigilance against all attempts by imperialism and will defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the unity and cohesion of the socialist camp as protecting the eyes. Our two countries will join hands with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries to make every effort to maintain and ensure world peace, to crush the imperialist policies of aggression, and for the victory of the immortal Marxist-Leninist ideology.

The speeches of Mayor Peng Zhen and Chairman Haxhi Lleshi were constantly interrupted by thunderous applause from the audience.

After the speeches, Mayor Peng Zhen, on behalf of the people of Beijing, presented a flag and gifts to Chairman Leshi. The silk banner with red background and gold letters read: "Pay tribute to the heroic Albanian people. Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people." After Chairman Leshi took the banner from Mayor Peng Zhen, he shook hands tightly with Mayor Peng Zhen. At this moment, the lights in the magnificent Great Hall of the People shone brightly, and the applause thundered for a long time.

After the welcoming rally, artists from the capital performed wonderful cultural programs such as choruses, Peking opera, symphonic poems, and dance dramas to add to the excitement.

Also present at the meeting today were Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru and Guo Moruo, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Albania Luo Shigao, President of the China-Albania Friendship Association Jiang Nanxiang, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Ren, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wan Li, and heads of various departments in Beijing.

    向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！中阿两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    首都万人隆重集会热烈欢迎列希主席
    彭真市长说，进一步揭穿美帝国主义的本质，反对它的侵略和战争政策，是全世界人民的迫切任务
    列希主席说，应该像保护眼睛一样的捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、社会主义阵营的团结和一致
    新华社4日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂举行盛大集会，隆重、热烈地欢迎阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希和全体阿尔巴尼亚贵宾。
    瑰丽的人民大会堂洋溢着一片友好欢乐的气氛，主席台中央的帷幕上并排高挂中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国的国旗。下午三时十五分，哈奇·列希主席等贵宾由刘少奇主席、周恩来总理、朱德委员长、彭真市长等领导人陪同走上主席台。这时，军乐队奏欢迎乐曲，全场起立，发出暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    在主席台上就座的贵宾，还有阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团委员、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记利丽·贝利绍娃，人民议会副主席列夫特·戈加，外交部副部长瓦西里·纳塔奈利，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂，正在北京的阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会代表团团长努什，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟代表团团长布列姆提等。
    一群少年先锋队员跑上主席台，向全体贵宾献了鲜花。
    欢迎大会在高奏阿尔巴尼亚和中国国歌声中开始。
    彭真市长在欢迎会开始的时候讲话，代表北京市全体人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。他谈到了阿尔巴尼亚建设的成绩，谈到了阿尔巴尼亚执行的和平外交政策。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义，坚决捍卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的伟大团结。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，始终不渝地对南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行不调和的斗争。中国人民衷心地敬佩阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对现代修正主义斗争中所表现的高度的革命原则性和坚强的战斗意志。
    彭真市长说：“目前，全世界人民正面临着进一步揭穿美帝国主义的本质，反对它的侵略和战争政策，维护世界和平的迫切任务。美帝国主义在破坏了四国政府首脑会议以后，尽管还大谈所谓‘和平努力’，表示愿意继续同苏联谈判，实际上却到处制造紧张局势，疯狂地加紧扩军备战。”他列举一系列事实证明，“美帝国主义正在继续施展两面手法，继续利用‘和平’伪装，洗刷它破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪责，掩护它进一步侵略扩张的活动。”他说：“这是值得全世界人民高度警惕的。”
    彭真市长斥责铁托集团故意歪曲事实，混淆是非，为它的美国主子辩护的奴才嘴脸。他说：铁托集团这样做不仅帮不了美帝国主义和它的头子艾森豪威尔的忙，反而再一次暴露了铁托集团完全是美帝国主义的最忠实的走狗。
    彭真市长说，美帝国主义的本质是绝对不会改变的。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，同时也是全世界人民最好的反面教员。它用自己的侵略行动，不断地促进全世界人民的觉悟和团结。美帝国主义坚持战争和侵略政策的结果，只能走向他的愿望的反面。这是历史发展的必然规律，是任何力量也不能改变的。
    彭真市长说：“我们社会主义阵营一贯坚持和平的外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，应该通过谈判解决国际争端，而不诉诸武力。我们的这种立场是坚定不移的。但是，无数的经验告诉我们，世界和平的取得必须主要依靠世界人民的斗争，对于帝国主义不能抱有不切实际的幻想。”
    彭真市长说：中国和阿尔巴尼亚是社会主义大家庭的亲密兄弟。“我们两国人民之间的友谊将不断得到巩固和发展。让我们更加紧密地携起手来，互相鼓舞，向着我们共同的目标，胜利前进。”
    当彭真市长邀请列希主席讲话的时候，暴风雨般的掌声长时间地震荡着会场。列希主席热情地赞扬了中阿两国的社会主义建设。他说：“我们的所有这些共同的胜利和成就显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的不容置疑的优越性、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大威力。”
    列希主席说：“当前的国际局势说明世界的力量对比有利于社会主义，说明社会主义制度无比优越于资本主义制度，说明以苏联为首的社会主义阵营成了各国人民和平和自由的不可摧毁的支柱。”他指出：“帝国主义正尽力企图采用新的手段加剧国际紧张局势，反对和平共处，阻碍悬而未决问题的解决。”他谴责美国派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的侵略行动和罪恶政策。
    他说：“美帝国主义的间谍破坏政策威胁着各国的国家主权和自由。因此，我们整个社会主义阵营和世界全体进步力量一致谴责美国政府的这一卑鄙行为，全力拥护支持苏联的正确立场。”
    他说：“尽管美国帝国主义者用侵略和挑衅的行动回答了苏联的和平政策，我们各国人民仍将继续进行为以和平方式解决悬而未决的问题的斗争。”
    列希主席说：“国际工人运动和共产主义运动的主要危险仍然是右倾机会主义和修正主义。”“南斯拉夫修正主义奉帝国主义之命‘从内部攻破堡垒’以分裂我们社会主义阵营的卑鄙使命遭到了并将继续遭到失败，以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭是牢不可破的，它比任何时候都更团结一致，没有一种力量能分裂我们的团结，因为我们的友谊和团结一致是生活所要求的，已成为客观历史的必然性。”
    列希主席说，阿尔巴尼亚和中国相隔千山万水，汪洋大海，但我们马克思列宁主义的党的正确政策永远消除了这种距离和障碍，我们的友谊在为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的我们两国人民的心灵深处已经生根发芽。对于帝国主义的一切企图，他们都将永远保持着警惕性，将像保护眼睛一样的捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、社会主义阵营的团结和一致。我们两国将同苏联和其他兄弟国家并肩携手为维护和确保世界和平，粉碎帝国主义的侵略政策，为不朽的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利而进行一切努力。
    彭真市长和哈奇·列希主席的讲话，不断被全场春雷般的掌声所打断。
    讲话以后，彭真市长代表北京市人民向列希主席赠旗、赠礼。这面红底金字的锦旗上写着：“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬。中阿两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁。”列希主席从彭真市长手中接过锦旗以后，同彭真市长紧紧握手。这时，灯光辉煌的大会堂里，掌声雷动，经久不息。
    欢迎大会结束后，首都艺术工作者演出了大合唱、京剧、交响诗、舞剧等精彩文艺节目助兴。
    今天，出席大会的，还有国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使罗士高，中国阿尔巴尼亚友好协会会长蒋南翔，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，北京市副市长万里，以及北京市各方面的负责人。（附图片）
