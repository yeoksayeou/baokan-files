Paving the Way for New Things
    -- On the Main Experiences in Promoting Rice Transplanters This Year

Creating new tools and technologies requires diligent effort, and promoting new tools and technologies requires even more arduous effort. We must use a tenacious and indomitable spirit to continuously solve the ideological, organizational, and technical problems in promotion and use, constantly paving the way and clearing obstacles for new tools and technologies, ensuring that they exert even greater power in production and that they are improved more perfectly in widespread use. This is the case with the promotion of new tools and technologies in industry, and it is also the case with the promotion of new tools and technologies in agriculture. This year, in the process of promoting rice transplanters, a wealth of experience has been accumulated. Seriously summarizing and absorbing these experiences and lessons is not only of great benefit to further promoting and improving rice transplanters, but also provides valuable lessons for promoting and improving new tools and technologies on the agricultural front and all production fronts.

During the early and mid-season rice transplanting this year, all rice-growing areas across the country have universally promoted various types of rice transplanters. The number of rice transplanters manufactured in various regions has reached more than 2.4 million. As soon as the rice transplanter was born, it demonstrated its great power, saving communes a lot of labor and improving the speed and quality of transplanting. According to statistics from Guizhou Province, the area of ​​rice fields transplanted by machine in the province has reached more than 60%; as of early June, it has saved approximately 2 million workdays compared to manual transplanting, and the transplanting progress is several times to more than ten times faster than manual transplanting, and the vast majority is transplanted densely, evenly, straight and firmly. In many other provinces and regions, the promotion and use of rice transplanters has also formed a widespread mass movement. The rice transplanter has attracted the broad masses, and improved the enthusiasm and creativity of millions of rural commune members to participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In areas that have resolutely and actively promoted rice transplanters, people's thinking has been continuously improved, and rice transplanters have also been continuously improved. In a few months, many better types of rice transplanters suitable for different local conditions have emerged, one better than the other. There are also individual areas where many of the rice transplanters that have already been created have not been used. After a brief trial, some problems and shortcomings were seen, and promotion was stopped without analysis and research. This not only cooled the enthusiasm for the newborn rice transplanter, but also dampened the enthusiasm of the masses for promoting and using new tools and technologies.

In the sharp contrast between these two types of regions, there are several experiences in promoting rice transplanters, which are also experiences in promoting other new tools and technologies, which are worthy of our attention. These are: First, leading cadres at all levels must go to the forefront of using rice transplanters, take rice transplanter experts as their teachers, and go to the fields to hold rice transplanters and work with the masses; Second, we must go deep into the masses to investigate and study, specifically understand the advantages and disadvantages of existing rice transplanters, and earnestly absorb the experience and opinions of the masses, concentrate them, improve existing rice transplanters, and then continue to promote them, and then absorb them again, study them again, improve them again, and promote them again, constantly revolutionizing; Third, ideological problems and technical problems must be solved simultaneously. Solving ideological problems can solve technical problems, and solving technical problems can more thoroughly solve ideological problems; specific analysis must be done for both ideological problems and technical problems, and a key must be used to open a lock.

Leading cadres walking in the forefront can not only play a leading role, but more importantly, only in this way can we grasp the key to the movement. As Comrade Mao Zedong told us in "On Practice": "Only by personally participating in the struggle to change reality and change certain or some things can we touch the phenomena of those things, and only by personally participating in the struggle to change reality can we expose the essence of those things and understand them." Responsible comrades from departments such as the Jiangxi Communist Youth League Provincial Committee, the Provincial Women's Federation, the Agriculture Department, and the Agricultural Machinery Department enthusiastically went to the fields in the rain to learn how to use rice transplanters, learning and learning again, striving for perfection. They seriously learned the operating techniques from the experts in using rice transplanters, carefully studied the structure of the rice transplanters, and personally experienced the benefits of the rice transplanters and specifically understood the characteristics of the rice transplanters. This not only enables them to take the lead in mobilizing the broad masses to use rice transplanters through practical actions, but also enables them to master living knowledge from practice in order to further improve rice transplanters. Party committee secretaries and many cadres at all levels in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, used rice transplanters together with the masses and studied rice transplanters together with the masses. A slight improvement to the original rice transplanter doubled the work efficiency; at first, the rice was not transplanted straight with the rice transplanter, but after the cadres operated and discussed it together with the masses, they also found a way to improve it. In this way, they learned while working, grasped the key to promoting rice transplanters, and opened up a situation of mechanization and semi-mechanization of rice transplanting.

Going deep among the masses, investigating and researching, repeatedly improving, and continuously promoting are precisely the leadership methods of the mass line and also the ideological methods that are completely in line with Marxist epistemology. When the Wuming County Party Committee in Guangxi promoted rice transplanters, it conducted extensive and in-depth investigation and research work among the masses. They discovered that two communes had improved the rice transplanter, making it easier to use, so they universally promoted the experience of these two communes throughout the county. Later, they discovered that another commune had made new improvements to the rice transplanter, so they seized the opportunity to promote it throughout the county. In this way, the interest of the masses throughout the county in using and improving rice transplanters was quickly and universally aroused; as a result, more and more new creations, new suggestions, and new experiences were concentrated from various communes to the county party committee. The county party committee attached great importance to the opinions from the masses, and promptly convened a meeting of cadres at all levels and departments and representatives of the masses to concentrate forces and comprehensively and systematically study how to further improve the rice transplanter. In seven days, the original rice transplanter was greatly improved. This is precisely the correct leadership method instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong: concentrate the opinions of the masses, then go to the masses to persist, and test them in the actions of the masses. Then gather from the masses and persist in the masses. This is an infinite loop, which is more correct, more vivid and more abundant each time.

The universal promotion and use of rice transplanters is a revolution in rice paddy farming technology and a major step in realizing the technological transformation of the entire agriculture. It will inevitably cause some new problems in ideology and technology, and it will inevitably take repeated struggles to achieve final victory. Ideological problems and technical problems must be analyzed concretely. Some people are unwilling to promote and use rice transplanters because they do not understand the benefits of rice transplanters and are still bound by old habits; or they do not understand the current economic situation and the great significance of vigorously engaging in the technical revolution. In order to solve these ideological problems, it is necessary to demonstrate the superiority of rice transplanters through typical demonstrations, and at the same time, talk about the favorable situation of the overall leap forward and the technical revolution, and use facts to carry out sharp persuasive education work against conservative thinking. The process of promoting rice transplanters in many places is like this. At first, some people were happy, some were skeptical, and some were opposed. The Party committee first organized discussions among the cadres to solve ideological problems; in the process of promotion, it continued to struggle against conservative thinking. Some places also organized rice transplanting competitions using rice transplanters and manual transplanting, and used vivid facts to persuade people with conservative thinking. Some people are not very active in promoting the use of rice transplanters because they have incorrect views on the shortcomings of new things. The existing rice transplanters do have some shortcomings, such as being prone to missing seedlings, injuring seedlings, and so on. These shortcomings are very small compared to the advantages; as long as we study them together with the masses with a positive attitude, the shortcomings can be eliminated. The facts in many places prove that rice transplanters can only more clearly expose various specific shortcomings in the course of universal promotion, and can only discover various effective ways to correct these shortcomings, so that rice transplanters can be improved more quickly. The process of improving rice transplanters in Wuming County is the most representative. Some rice transplanters are not easy to use, not because the design style of the rice transplanter is not good, but because the manufacturing quality is not good, or the use technology is not good. Therefore, special attention should be paid to grasping every important link in manufacturing and use. One of the important signs of grasping every link is that at every link, leading cadres go deep among the masses and work and think together with the masses. Many leading cadres in Guizhou Province have closely integrated with skilled craftsmen who manufacture rice transplanters and rice transplanting experts who use rice transplanters: on the one hand, they stay in the workshop with the experts in using rice transplanters and work with the workers to assist the factory in improving the rice transplanters; on the other hand, they go to the fields with the workers who manufacture rice transplanters and work with the farmers to discover and solve problems in time in the use of rice transplanters. In this way, many agricultural machinery factories have already achieved that every rice transplanter they manufacture is useful and the quality is fully qualified; in many areas, the phenomena of seedling injury and hooking seedlings have been basically eliminated in the rice seedlings transplanted by rice transplanters. At the same time, they also universally train rice transplanter operators, organize roving performances, and promote new rice transplanting technologies in a timely manner. In this way, they have achieved the combination of point and surface, the combination of leadership and the masses, the combination of general appeals and specific guidance, and the combination of ideological work and technical work, which has greatly promoted the technical revolution movement to develop in agricultural production at high speed and with high quality.

The birth of new tools and new technologies requires resolute promoters, and the promotion of new tools and new technologies requires even more resolute promoters. Who is still unwilling to be a promoter now? However, there is still a big gap between the "promoters" in words and the real promoters. The most resolute promoters must be the most mass-oriented and the best at following the mass line, and they must be the most realistic and pragmatic; they always go to the forefront of the struggle between the old and new things, lay a solid foundation for new things, and open up a broad road for new things. Things are constantly developing, and newer things are constantly appearing in the front; only by always going deep among the masses and going deep into reality can we always walk in front.

    为新生事物开辟道路
    ——论今年推广插秧机的主要经验
    创造新工具新技术要作很辛勤的努力，推广新工具新技术更要作十分艰巨的努力。要用坚韧不拔、百折不挠的顽强精神，不断解决在推广使用中的思想问题、组织问题和技术问题，不断为新工具新技术开辟道路、扫清道路，保证它在生产中发挥更为巨大的威力，保证它在广泛使用中改进得更加完善。在工业中推广新工具新技术是这样，在农业中推广新工具新技术也是这样。今年，在推广插秧机的过程中，积累了很丰富的经验。认真总结和吸取这些经验教训，不只是对进一步推广和改进插秧机有很大好处，对于在农业战线和一切生产战线上推广和改进新工具新技术，都有很可贵的教益。
    在今年早稻、中稻插秧期间，全国各个种植水稻的地区普遍推广了各式各样的插秧机。各地制造的插秧机，已经达到二百四十多万部。插秧机刚一诞生，就表现出来了巨大的威力，为公社节约了大量的劳动力，提高了插秧的速度和质量。据贵州省统计，全省稻田机插面积已经达到60％以上；到6月上旬为止，已经比手工插秧节约了大约二百万个工作日，插秧进度比手插秧快几倍到十几倍，绝大部分插得又密又匀又直又稳。在其他许多省、区，推广使用插秧机也形成了广泛的群众运动。插秧机吸引了广大群众，提高了千百万农村公社社员参加技术革新和技术革命运动的积极性和创造性。凡是坚决地积极地推广了插秧机的地区，人们的思想都在不断提高，插秧机也在不断改进。几个月间，适合各地不同情况的更好型式的插秧机，又出现了很多，一个赛过一个。也有个别地区，已经创造出来的插秧机还有不少没有使用，刚试用了一下，看到一些问题和缺点，不加分析研究就不再推广，这就不只冷淡了插秧机这个新生的事物，而且冷淡了群众推广使用新工具新技术的积极性。
    在这两种地区的鲜明对比中，有几条推广插秧机的经验，也是推广其他新工具新技术的经验，很值得我们注意。这就是：一、各级领导干部要走到使用插秧机的最前线去，拜使用插秧机的能手为师，到田间去手持插秧机同群众一起干；二、要深入群众调查研究，具体地了解现有的插秧机的优点和缺点，认真地吸取群众的经验和意见，把它们集中起来，对现有的插秧机加以改进，然后再继续推广，以后又再吸取，再研究，再改进，再推广，不断革命；三、思想问题和技术问题要同时解决，解决了思想问题才能解决技术问题，解决了技术问题又能更彻底地解决思想问题；对思想问题和技术问题都要具体分析，一把钥匙开一把锁。
    领导干部走在最前面，不只是可以起带头作用，更重要的是，只有这样才能抓住运动的关键。正如毛泽东同志在“实践论”中告诉我们的：“只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”江西共青团省委、省妇联、农业厅、农业机械厅等部门的负责同志，兴致勃勃地冒雨到田间学习使用插秧机，学了再学，精益求精。他们认真地向使用插秧机的能手们学习操作技术，精心地研究插秧机的构造，亲身体验到了插秧机的好处，具体了解了插秧机的特性。这样做，不但能够以实际行动带动广大群众使用插秧机，并且能够从实践中掌握活的知识，以便进一步提高插秧机。江西进贤县各级党委书记和许多干部同群众一起使用插秧机，同群众一起研究插秧机，把原有的插秧机稍加改进，就提高工效一倍；开初用插秧机插得不直，在干部同群众一起操作、一起讨论之后也找到了改进的办法。他们就这样一边干、一边学，掌握了推广插秧机的关键，打开了插秧机械化半机械化的局面。
    深入群众，调查研究，反复改进，不断推广，这正是群众路线的领导方法，也是完全合乎马克思主义认识论的思想方法。广西武鸣县委在推广插秧机的时候，到群众中作了广泛的深入的调查研究工作。他们发现两个公社对插秧机作了改进，使插秧机更加好用了，就把这两个公社的经验在全县普遍推广。以后发现另一个公社对插秧机有了新的改进，就又紧紧抓住向全县推广。这样，很快就普遍地引起了全县群众使用和改进插秧机的兴趣；于是，越来越多的新创造、新建议、新经验从各个公社集中到县委来。县委十分重视来自群众的意见，及时召集各级各部门干部和群众代表开会，集中火力全面地系统地研究更进一步提高插秧机，七天时间就把原有的插秧机大大改进了一番。这正是毛泽东同志指示我们的正确的领导方法：将群众的意见集中起来，又到群众中去坚持下去，在群众行动中去考验。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次更正确、更生动、更丰富。
    普遍地推广使用插秧机，是水田耕作技术上的一次革命，是实现整个农业技术改造的一个重大步骤，在思想上和技术上必然会引起一些新问题，必然要经过反复的斗争才能得到最后的胜利。对于思想问题和技术问题，都要具体分析。有人不愿推广使用插秧机，是不了解插秧机的好处，还受着旧的习惯势力的束缚；或者是不了解当前的经济形势，不了解大搞技术革命的重大意义。为了解决这些思想问题，就要通过典型示范，把插秧机的优越性表现出来，同时大讲全面跃进和技术革命的有利形势，用事实对保守思想进行针锋相对的说服教育工作。许多地方推广插秧机的过程都是这样的。起初，有人高兴，有人怀疑，有人反对。党委首先在干部中组织讨论，解决思想问题；在推广过程中，继续不断地对保守思想进行斗争。有些地方还组织了使用插秧机插秧和手工插秧的比赛，用生动的事实说服了有保守思想的人。有些人对于推广使用插秧机不很积极，是因为对待新生事物的缺点有不正确的看法。现有的某些插秧机的确还有若干缺点，如容易漏秧、伤秧等等。这些缺点同优点比较起来是很小的；只要用积极的态度同群众一起研究，缺点都是可以消除的。许多地方的事实证明，插秧机正是要在普遍推广中才能更明显地暴露出各种具体的缺点，才能发现改正这些缺点的各种有效办法，才能使插秧机更快地健全起来。武鸣县改进插秧机的过程，就是最有代表性的。有些插秧机不好使，并不是插秧机设计的样式不好，而是制造的质量不好，或者使用技术不好。因此，要特别注意抓紧制造和使用的每个重要环节。抓紧每个环节的重要的标志之一，就是在每个环节上领导干部都深入群众，同群众一起干、一起想。贵州省各地很多领导干部同制造插秧机的能工巧匠和使用插秧机的插秧能手密切结合：一方面同使用插秧机的能手一起驻车间，同工人一起协助工厂改进插秧机；另方面同制造插秧机的工人一起下田间，同农民一起在使用插秧机中及时地发现问题和解决问题。这样，许多农具厂已经做到制造的插秧机每一部都管用，质量完全合格；许多地区用插秧机插的秧苗已经基本上消灭了伤秧、勾秧等现象。同时，他们还普遍地培训插秧机手，组织巡回表演，及时推广新的插秧技术。这样，就做到了点和面相结合，领导和群众相结合，一般号召和具体指导相结合，思想工作和技术工作相结合，就很好地促进技术革命运动高速度高质量地在农业生产中也发展起来。
    新工具新技术的诞生，需要坚决的促进派，新工具新技术的推广，更需要坚决的促进派。现在还有谁不愿意做促进派呢？可是，口头上的“促进派”和真正的促进派还有很大的距离。最坚决的促进派，一定是最有群众观点、最善于走群众路线的，一定是最深入实际、最实事求是的；他们总是到新旧事物斗争的最前线去，为新生事物打下坚实的基础，为新生事物开辟宽阔的道路。事物在不断发展，不断有更新的事物在前头出现；只有永远深入群众、深入实际，才能永远走在前面。
