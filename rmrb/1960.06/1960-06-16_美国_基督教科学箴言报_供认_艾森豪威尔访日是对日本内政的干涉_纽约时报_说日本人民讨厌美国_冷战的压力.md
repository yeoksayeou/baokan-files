Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 15th: Numerous American newspapers, in commenting on Eisenhower's trip to the Far East, continue to reveal that this is an important step for the United States to intensify its aggression and new war conspiracies in the Far East. At the same time, in view of the strong anti-American imperialist sentiments of the people in various Far Eastern countries, these newspapers remain concerned about Eisenhower's reception.

The "New York Times" said on the 14th that "Eisenhower, on this current visit, will reach every important bastion of the northern arc of the American defense (system) in Asia," and the president decided to go to the Far East because of the region's "political and strategic importance" to the United States.

The newspaper went on to say that the four objects of Eisenhower's visit—Japan, Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group, the Philippines, and South Korea—their rule "greatly relies on American policies and support. Washington's prestige, not to mention its Pacific defense system, is linked to their fate."

At the same time, the "New York Times" had to admit: In the Far East, many Asians in countries allied with the United States "hate the pressures of the Cold War."

The newspaper said: "In Japan, this sentiment has recently been most evident." What kind of reception Eisenhower "will receive in Japan is a serious question."

The newspaper also said that "many observers are concerned that the president's stay in Japan could be dangerous for both himself and American prestige. Even if no serious incidents occur during the visit and the (U.S.-Japan military alliance) treaty is passed, the movement against the Nobusuke Kishi government seems certain to continue."

The editor of the "Christian Science Monitor," Erwin D. Canham, admitted that Eisenhower's trip has the nature of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. He said: "At a time when fierce opposition to the new treaty (referring to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty) is rising in Japan, it is clear that the existence of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet relies, at least to some extent, on the president's visit."

He also said, "It is believed that (Eisenhower) is making this visit to help the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is in crisis... Almost from the beginning, Eisenhower's arrival in Japan has definitely become a kind of interference in Japanese affairs," and "it is basically illegal for a country to interfere in the internal affairs of another country."

An editorial in the Washington "Evening Star" on the 12th advocated that Eisenhower cancel his trip to Japan. The newspaper's editorial said that demonstrators besieged Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's private residence, "which means to us that the Japanese cannot or are unwilling to protect their own prime minister... So why imagine that they can or are willing to protect the President of the United States?"

According to an Associated Press report on the 14th, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who has been to the Far East many times, is also concerned about Eisenhower's trip. He said: "The Far East is white-hot. Anything can happen, and they (the people there) still remember how we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

### 美国“基督教科学箴言报”供认  艾森豪威尔访日是对日本内政的干涉  “纽约时报”说日本人民讨厌美国“冷战的压力”

    美国“基督教科学箴言报”供认
    艾森豪威尔访日是对日本内政的干涉
    “纽约时报”说日本人民讨厌美国“冷战的压力”
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：不少美国报刊在评论艾森豪威尔的远东之行时继续透露，这是美国加紧在远东推行侵略和新战争阴谋的重要步骤。同时，鉴于远东各国人民反对美帝国主义的强烈情绪，这些报刊仍然对艾森豪威尔的遭遇感到担心。
    “纽约时报”14日说，“艾森豪威尔在当前的这次访问中，将要到达美国在亚洲的防御（体系）北部弧形地带的每一个重要堡垒”，而总统之所以决定去远东，就是因为考虑到这个地区对美国的“政治和战略的重要性”。
    这家报纸接着说，艾森豪威尔访问的四个对象——日本、台湾蒋介石集团、菲律宾和南朝鲜、其统治都是“大大依靠美国的政策和支持而存在的。华盛顿的威信，更不用谈它的太平洋防御体系，都同它们的命运连在一起。”
    同时“纽约时报”不得不承认：在远东地区，同美国结盟的那些国家里的许多亚洲人“讨厌冷战的压力”。
    这家报纸说：“在日本，这种情绪近来表现得最为明显。”艾森豪威尔“在日本会受到什么样的接待，这是个严重的问题”。
    这家报纸又说，“许多观察家都担心总统在日本的停留对他自己和美国的威信都可能是危险的。即使访问期间没有发生严重的事件而且（美日军事同盟）条约得以通过，反对岸信介政府的运动看来仍然肯定要继续下去。”
    “基督教科学箴言报”总编辑坎汉承认，艾森豪威尔此行具有干涉他国内政的性质。他说：“正当日本国内对新的条约（指日美军事同盟条约）的激烈反对日益高涨的时候，很明显，岸信介内阁的存在至少在若干程度上是依靠总统的访问的。”
    他还说，“人们认为，（艾森豪威尔）作这次访问是要帮助处在危机中的岸信介政府……差不多从一开始，艾森豪威尔的到达日本就肯定地成为对日本事务的某种干涉”，而“一个国家干涉他国内政基本上是非法的”。
    华盛顿“明星晚报”12日的社论主张艾森豪威尔取消日本之行。这家报纸的社论说，示威者围困了岸信介首相的私邸，“这对我们来说意味着日本人不能或不愿意保护他们自己的首相……那么为什么要设想他们能够或愿意保护美国的总统呢？”
    据美联社14日报道，曾多次去远东活动的美国最高法院法官道格拉斯对艾森豪威尔这次出行也感到担心。他说：“远东是白热化的。任何事情都可能发生，他们（那里的人民）仍然记得我们是怎样轰炸广岛和长崎的。”
