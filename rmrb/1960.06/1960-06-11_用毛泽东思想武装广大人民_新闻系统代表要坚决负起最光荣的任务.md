Xinhua News Agency, 10th: News system representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education held a meeting today to exchange work experience.

Mei Yi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association and Director of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, said at the meeting: Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the glorious banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, our country's news undertakings have actively publicized the Party's lines, principles, and policies, the revolutionary spirit and communist style of the people, and the great victories of socialist revolution and construction. At the same time, they have resolutely exposed and attacked imperialism, first and foremost U.S. imperialism, all reactionaries at home and abroad, modern revisionism, and right-leaning conservative thinking. Thus, our news undertakings have played the role of organizing, encouraging, inspiring, criticizing, and promoting, becoming an important weapon for socialist revolution and construction.

Mei Yi concluded by saying that arming the broad masses of people with Mao Zedong Thought is the most important and glorious task of our news work. News workers across the country must launch a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our news undertakings should have a stronger political nature, ideological nature, guiding nature, and fighting nature, which means a stronger Party spirit. Subsequently, fifteen representatives spoke at the meeting. They respectively introduced the achievements and experiences of newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and mass-based communication writing work under the leadership of Party committees since the Great Leap Forward. Ding Jicang, representative of Shaanxi Daily, Deng Yingjun, representative of Yilong County Newspaper in Sichuan Province, and Wang Wei, representative of the Writing and Communication Group of the Xiaoxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Anhui Province, all introduced the achievements and experiences of further implementing the policy of the whole Party running newspapers in their speeches. Ding Jicang said that under the leadership of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shaanxi Daily, relying on Party committees at all levels, vigorously promoted the "internal and external three-way combination" of Party committees at all levels, the editorial department, and the masses, further giving play to the initiative of Party committees at all levels in organizing news reports, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of actual work cadres and worker-peasant activists to participate in newspaper work, and carrying out large-scale collaboration among news workers throughout the province. He used many facts to illustrate that vigorously promoting the "three-way combination" is a new development in the whole Party running newspapers and is the fundamental way to run newspapers well. Wang Wei introduced the achievements and experiences of the Xiaoxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in establishing and leading writing and communication organizations.
