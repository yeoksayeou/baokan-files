    杂技团演出的所有节目受到观众高度的赞赏和热烈的鼓掌。演出结束时，巴德尔王太子走上舞台，同演员们一一握手，并一起合影。巴德尔王太子在王宫的接待厅里接见了杂技团的负责人。
    巴德尔王太子代表也门国王和也门人民，向中国杂技团全体人员表示感谢。他说：“我访问过你们的国家，我在那里有很多朋友，我相信你们在也门也将会找到许多朋友。”他又说，他肯定，代表团不论到也门的那里去，都将会受到也门人民的欢迎。杂技团是在19日乘也门国王所派的专机从塔兹来到萨那的。杂技团在塔兹期间共演出了三次。
    中国杂技团的表演在塔兹是空前的。观众在开幕前四小时就开始在塔兹检阅场上的舞台前面聚集。遇到下雨，观众们还是等着不走。有些人接连看了三次表演。
