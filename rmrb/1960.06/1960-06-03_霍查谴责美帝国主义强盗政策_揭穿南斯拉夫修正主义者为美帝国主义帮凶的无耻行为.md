    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 1st: The Albanian newspapers "People's Voice" and "Unity" today published news of Albanian Labor Party First Secretary Hoxha's recent inspection of the Peshkopi District and excerpts from his speech during a visit to the "Road of the Party" Agricultural Cooperative.

    In his speech, Hoxha condemned the robber policies of US imperialism, particularly its dispatch of spy planes to violate Soviet airspace. He then pointed out that US imperialism shamelessly sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference.

    Hoxha emphasized that the claims of the Yugoslav revisionists shamelessly attempted to minimize the seriousness of this robber behavior of US imperialism, which is condemned by all progressive humanity, while at the same time trying to shift the responsibility for the failure of the summit conference onto the Soviet Union.

    In his conversation with cooperative members, Hoxha also spoke about the economic achievements of the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries, as well as the unity and strength of the great socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. He also spoke about agricultural cooperativization and other issues. He said that by the time of the Fourth Party Congress to be held in November this year, Albania will have completed agricultural cooperativization.

    He said that socialist labor emulation can promote productivity. He also said that in order to make our agriculture advance faster, the Party has taken a series of important measures in the past and present, such as increasing agricultural machinery and expanding irrigation areas.

    霍查强调指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者的主张无耻地竭力缩小美帝国主义这种受到整个进步人类谴责的强盗行为的严重性，同时竭力把首脑会议开不成的责任推到苏联身上。
    霍查在同合作社社员们谈话时还谈到苏联和所有其他社会主义国家在经济方面获得的成就，以及以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的团结和坚强的力量。他还谈到农业合作化等问题。他说，到将在今年11月召开的第四次党代表大会时，阿尔巴尼亚将完成农业合作化。
