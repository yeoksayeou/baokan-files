    "All Foreign Troops Out!"
    – The Moroccan People's Struggle Against Foreign Military Bases
    Wang Wei, Lu Mingzhu
            The People's Anger
    The clear Moroccan sky is often polluted by American jet planes; the beautiful Moroccan land is stationed with tens of thousands of American, French, and Spanish troops; the picturesque Moroccan coast is docked with warships flying the Stars and Stripes.
    "As long as foreign military bases (American, French, Spanish) and foreign troops exist in Morocco, Morocco's independence is incomplete." This is the common feeling of Moroccan patriots. For four years since independence, the Moroccan people have been waging an unyielding struggle to withdraw foreign troops and recover occupied territories. They have made a common oath: "Independence is not complete, the struggle will not end!"
    On February 21, 1959, a demonstration that shook the imperialist elements appeared on the streets of Rabat, the capital of Morocco. Angry masses surged towards the American Embassy, the Spanish Embassy, and the French Embassy, holding high the banners of "Yankees Go Home," "Imperialists Get Out," and "Africa is for Africans." They protested against the occupation of Moroccan territory by foreign troops, and they demanded that all foreign troops get out.
    The people have expressed this righteous indignation more than once. At a rally held by young workers to protest the French killing of Algerian trade union leaders, and in the recent march in Casablanca protesting French atomic weapons tests in the Sahara, the first angry roar was "All foreign troops get out," because the disaster that the Moroccan people feel most acutely is that foreign troops are still occupying Moroccan territory. Every political party and every organization in Morocco considers the withdrawal of foreign troops as one of their main current tasks. They have put forward a clear program for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Last November, the King of Morocco said in his "Speech from the Throne," "The withdrawal of foreign troops is Morocco's top priority."
        Startling Scenes
    Looking at a map of Morocco, no other African country is filled with so many foreign military bases from north to south. Not far from the capital Rabat, along the highway, are the power grids of American military bases, and tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land are surrounded by these barbed wire fences. When Eisenhower stepped off the plane from the Nouasseur military base near Casablanca, we witnessed with our own eyes the enormous aircraft hangars of this military base filled with various types of military aircraft, countless shells piled up at the airport, and hundreds of cars belonging to American members of the base densely packed at one end of the airport.
    After World War II, when Morocco was still a "protectorate," the United States and France signed a secret agreement, and the United States spent $400 million to establish four military bases in Morocco in 1950 and 1951, and expanded the Kenitra base. These bases are the Nouasseur, Sidi Slimane, Ben Guerir, and Boulhaut strategic air bases and the Kenitra US-French joint naval and air military base. Nouasseur was originally a transit and storage base, but in 1958 the United States assigned it to the "Strategic Air Command," making it an important American strategic air base near the Moroccan capital. In the words of the American newspapers, these bases have become purely American "combat strongholds." These strategic air bases all store nuclear weapons. According to the American Embassy in Morocco, there are 21,000 American troops stationed at these bases.
          Endless Calamities
    Foreign military bases have caused endless calamities to Morocco. People still remember that on July 9 last year, an American plane taking off from the American Ben Guerir military base dropped twenty-five bombs for no reason near Ben Ahmed on Moroccan territory. Fortunately, these bombs fell in the fields and did not hurt anyone. Although some newspapers exposed these incidents, the American authorities still did nothing.
    Another thing that aroused the anger of the Moroccan people was that at the Sidi Slimane American military base, a plane carrying atomic bombs caught fire. At such a dangerous moment, the American soldiers and officials at the base climbed into cars and fled, leaving the Moroccan workers at the airport and the nearby residents unattended. In the Nouasseur base, there were also atrocities of American staff and military police unreasonably beating Moroccan workers.
    A few months ago, there was also an incident in which two soldiers from the American base were sent to court because they used the base to smuggle large quantities of goods. American military supplies and trucks appeared in large quantities on the black market because these materials, as "military use," were exempt from import and export duties, and were completely free to enter and exit.
    Moroccan newspapers have strongly demanded that American nuclear weapons be removed from Moroccan territory. "Liberation" said that Morocco is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the storage of American nuclear weapons in Morocco not only endangers world peace but also threatens Morocco's own security.
    The American imperialists themselves admit that the American military bases in Morocco and other parts of Africa are for launching wars against socialist countries. The "New York Herald Tribune" once undisguisedly said: "The American military bases in Morocco are part of a chain of air bases around the globe to defend against a possible Soviet offensive." However, people still remember that on October 15, 1957, an American bomber squadron took off from a military base in Morocco and went to Turkey and Saudi Arabia, preparing to use them as bases to armed intervention in Syria at that time. The United States also used its military bases in Morocco, colluding with France to oppose the Moroccan people. Because France frequently armed invaded the Moroccan border and killed Moroccan people, in June 1958, Morocco refused French troops to land in Casablanca, but the United States colluded with France, and these French troops used the Nouasseur American military base to enter Morocco. From this, it can be seen that the American military bases in Morocco are not only aimed at socialist countries, but also used to deal with the people of the Middle East and Africa.
      Raise Vigilance and Persist in Struggle
    Due to the resolute struggle of the Moroccan people, when Eisenhower "visited" Morocco last year, he was forced to agree to abolish the American military bases in Morocco after four years (i.e., in 1963). In March of this year, the United States was forced to withdraw from the Sidi Slimane base. This is a preliminary victory for the Moroccan people. However, the Moroccan people are vigilantly paying attention to the next conspiracy of American imperialism. Just in March of this year, on the day when the United States was forced to withdraw from the Sidi Slimane base, teams of American jet military aircraft unscrupulously flew low over Rabat, making deafening screams, as a demonstrative "farewell." How can the Moroccan people not be vigilant? Not long ago, the Moroccan "Opinion" pointed out to the people that the United States is trying to gradually turn its military bases into bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, thereby pulling Morocco into the "North Atlantic Treaty System," and these bases will exist forever. As early as in the secret treaty signed between the United States and France on the base agreement, the United States harbored this malicious intention. The "preamble" to this secret agreement signed on December 22, 1950, began like this:
    "Both parties take into consideration their respective responsibilities for defending Western Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization..." Article 14 of the agreement stipulates that "the validity period of the treaty is the same as that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
    Moroccan public opinion has repeatedly pointed out this dangerous conspiracy. The Moroccan government has also repeatedly stated that it pursues a neutral policy of non-alignment. Last year, the Moroccan government rejected the generals of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters from coming to Morocco to "inspect" the military bases. The purpose of these generals' planned "visit" and "inspection" was to implement the proposal of Spaak, Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council. Spaak had stated at the Washington Conference of the North Atlantic Group parliamentarians held last November that the way to save the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was to expand this treaty to the Middle East and African countries.
    However, this conspiracy of imperialism will not succeed, and the foreign invading troops will one day finally get out of Morocco.

### “一切外国军队滚回去！”——摩洛哥人民反对外国军事基地的斗争

    “一切外国军队滚回去！”
    ——摩洛哥人民反对外国军事基地的斗争
    王纬　陆明珠
            人民的愤怒
    清明澄澈的摩洛哥天空，常常被美国的喷气飞机所污染；美丽的摩洛哥国土驻扎着成千上万的美国的、法国的、西班牙的军队；风光绮丽的摩洛哥海滨停泊着插着星条旗的军舰。
    “只要摩洛哥还存在着外国军事基地（美国、法国、西班牙）和外国军队，摩洛哥的独立就是不完整的。”这是摩洛哥的爱国者共同的感受。独立四年来，摩洛哥人民为争取撤出外国军队，收复被占领的领土进行着不屈不挠的斗争。他们发出共同的誓言：“独立不完整，斗争不终止！”
    1959年2月21日，摩洛哥首都拉巴特街头出现了震撼帝国主义分子的示威游行。愤怒的群众涌向美国大使馆、西班牙大使馆和法国大使馆门前，他们高举着“美国佬滚回去”，“帝国主义滚回去”，“非洲是非洲人民的非洲”的旗帜。他们抗议外国军队占领摩洛哥的领土，他们要求一切外国军队滚回去。
    人民群众不止一次表示了这种义愤。在青年工人举行的抗议法国杀害阿尔及利亚工会领袖的集会上，在不久前在卡萨布兰卡举行的抗议法国在撒哈拉试验原子武器的游行示威中，人们第一个愤怒的吼声就是“一切外国军队滚回去”，因为摩洛哥人民切身感到的灾难就是外国军队还霸占着摩洛哥的领土。摩洛哥的每个政党，每个团体，都把撤退外国军队作为他们当前的主要斗争任务之一。他们提出了撤退外国军队的明确的纲领。去年11月摩洛哥国王在他的“御前演说”中说，“撤退外国军队是摩洛哥的当务之急。
        触目惊心的景象
    打开摩洛哥地图一看，非洲国家没有一个像摩洛哥这样，从北到南布满了这样多的外国军事基地。离开首都拉巴特不远，沿公路就是美国军事基地的电网，千万顷肥沃的土地被围进了这些铁丝网。当艾森豪威尔从卡萨布兰卡附近的努瓦塞军事基地走下飞机的时候，我们亲眼看见这个军事基地庞大的飞机库里停满了各式各样的军用飞机，机场内堆积着无数的炮弹，机场的一端密密麻麻地摆了数百辆属于基地上的美国成员的小汽车。
    第二次世界大战之后，当摩洛哥还是“保护国”的时候，美国和法国签订了秘密协定，美国花了四亿美元，在1950年、1951年在摩洛哥建立了四个军事基地并扩大了肯尼特基地。这些基地是努瓦塞、西迪·斯里曼、本·古列赫、布纳赫特战略空军基地和肯尼特美法海空联合军事基地。本来努瓦塞是一个转运和储存基地，但是1958年美国把它隶属于“战略空军司令部”，成为摩洛哥首都附近的美国重要的战略空军基地。用美国报纸的话来说，这些基地已经纯粹是美国的“战斗据点”了。这些战略空军基地都储存有原子武器。据驻摩洛哥的美国大使馆宣布，驻在这些基地的美国军队有二万一千人。
          无穷无尽的祸害
    外国军事基地给摩洛哥造成了无穷的祸害。人们还记得，去年7月9日，美国另一个军事基地本·古利赫起飞的一架美国飞机在摩洛哥领土本·艾哈默德附近无缘无故的扔下二十五枚炸弹，因为这些炸弹落在田里，幸未伤人。尽管这些事情有的报纸进行了揭露，但美国当局还是不了了之。
    另一件引起摩洛哥人民愤怒的事情是，在西迪·斯里曼美国军事基地，一架载运原子弹的飞机起了火，在这样危险的时刻，基地的美国兵和官员爬上汽车逃之夭夭，而撇下机场的摩洛哥工人和附近的居民不管。在努瓦塞基地还发生美国职员和宪兵无理殴打摩洛哥工人的暴行。
    几个月以前还发生了美国基地的两个士兵被送进法院的事件。因为他们利用基地大量走私。美国的军用物资、卡车在黑市上大量出现。因为这些作为“军用”的物资，进出口都免税，而且进出完全自由。
    摩洛哥的报纸曾经强烈地要求把美国的原子武器从摩洛哥的领土上搬走。“解放报”说，摩洛哥不是北大西洋公约组织的成员，美国在摩洛哥储存原子武器不但危害世界和平而且威胁着摩洛哥自身的安全。
    美帝国主义者自己也承认，美国在摩洛哥以及非洲其它地区的军事基地是为了对社会主义国家发动战争的。“纽约先驱论坛报”曾经毫不掩饰地说：“美国在摩洛哥的军事基地是防御苏联可能的进攻的环绕全球的空军基地锁链的一部分”。但是，人们还记得，1957年10月15日美国一个轰炸机飞行中队从摩洛哥的军事基地起飞，前往土耳其和沙特阿拉伯，准备从那里武装干涉当时的叙利亚。美国还利用它在摩洛哥的军事基地，和法国沆瀣一气来反对摩洛哥人民。由于法国经常武装侵犯摩洛哥边境、杀害摩洛哥人民，1958年6月，摩洛哥拒绝法国军队从卡萨布兰卡登陆，但是美国同法国串通一气，这些法国军队利用努瓦塞美国军事基地进入了摩洛哥。从这里可以看出，美国在摩洛哥的军事基地，不仅针对社会主义国家，而且也是用来对付中东和非洲人民的。
      提高警惕坚持斗争
    由于摩洛哥人民坚决的斗争，去年艾森豪威尔“访问”摩洛哥的时候，被迫同意在四年之后（即1963年）取消美国在摩洛哥的军事基地。今年3月，美国被迫撤出了西迪·斯里曼基地。这是摩洛哥人民所取得的初步胜利。但是，摩洛哥人民警惕地注意着美国帝国主义的下一步的阴谋。就在今年3月，当美国被迫撤出西迪·斯里曼基地的那天，成队的美国喷气式军用飞机肆无忌惮地低低掠过拉巴特上空，发出震耳的尖叫，作示威式的“告别”。摩洛哥人民怎能不加以警惕呢？不久前，摩洛哥“舆论报”向人民指出，美国企图把它的这些军事基地逐步变成北大西洋公约组织的基地，从而把摩洛哥拉入“北大西洋公约体系”，这些基地也就永远存在下去了。早在美国和法国签定基地协定的秘密条约中，美国就包藏着这个祸心了。这个在1950年12月22日签订的秘密协定的“序言”是这样开端的：
  “双方考虑到它们根据北大西洋公约组织保卫西欧的各自的责任……”，协定的十四条规定，“条约的有效期限与北大西洋公约组织同”。
    摩洛哥舆论一再指出这个险毒的阴谋。摩洛哥政府也一再表示，它奉行中立的不依附政策。去年摩洛哥政府就拒绝了北大西洋公约组织司令部的将军们来摩洛哥“视察”军事基地。这些将军们计划“访问”“视察”的目的在于实行北大西洋公约组织理事会秘书长斯巴克的主张。斯巴克曾在去年11月间召开的北大西洋集团议员华盛顿会议上声言，拯救北大西洋公约组织的途径是把这个公约扩大到中东和非洲国家。
    但是帝国主义这个阴谋是不会得逞的，外国侵略军队终有一天要最后地滚出摩洛哥的。
