    Vigorously Grasp Fertilizer Production
    The Jiangsu Xinhua Daily published an editorial on June 4 entitled "Grasp Fertilizer Production Like Water Conservancy." The following is a summary:
    Everyone knows that fertilizer is the "grain" of crops and an important factor in increasing agricultural production. Since the Great Leap Forward, all localities have implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture relatively comprehensively, with great achievements. If we compare these eight points, we will find that in most areas of the province, fertilizer shortage is the most prominent problem.
    How to solve the fertilizer problem? What kind of fertilizer should we focus on? "Heavy application of base fertilizer, skillful application of top dressing" is an experience accumulated over many years in agricultural production. This means that we should focus on solving the problem of base fertilizer. Among base fertilizers, we should focus on grasping farmyard manure, green manure, and other refined fertilizers. The current actual situation is that both the quantity and quality of base fertilizer are insufficient. In many places, base fertilizer mainly consists of river mud, smoked soil, compost, stagnant silt, wall soil, etc. In short, it is mainly mud fertilizer, and the amount of grass fertilizer, farmyard manure, and other refined fertilizers used as base fertilizer is small. Of course, in the case of insufficient refined fertilizer, it is extremely necessary to produce more mud fertilizer. However, mud fertilizer requires a lot of labor and has little effect. Relying solely on mud fertilizer cannot solve the problem. While continuing to grasp crude fertilizer (mud fertilizer), we must take all effective measures to quickly change the situation of insufficient refined fertilizer.
    Our province has ample sources of refined fertilizer and many avenues. The conditions for planting green manure, accumulating farmyard manure, and developing aquatic green manure are extremely favorable. The province also has more urban fertilizer that can be utilized.
    An important measure for accumulating and producing refined fertilizer is to actively develop animal husbandry production, with pigs as the leader. Raising one pig can accumulate 30 to 60 dan of fertilizer per year, which can fertilize two to three mu of land. Therefore, we must accelerate the development of pigs and other large livestock. If the province's pig raising first reaches the current level of Binhai County, with an average of three pigs per household, a large amount of refined fertilizer can be accumulated. We must vigorously grasp animal husbandry production, accumulate farmyard manure, and gradually change the current situation of insufficient refined fertilizer.
    Green manure can be planted everywhere in the province, which is one of the main ways to solve the fertilizer problem. The potential of green manure is great and must be grasped well. To develop green manure, we must effectively solve three key issues. First, grasp the area. The central issue in expanding the area of green manure is the rational arrangement of crop rotations. Plant it alone if you can plant it alone, interplant it if you can interplant it, plant summer green manure if you can plant summer green manure, plant spring green manure if you can plant spring green manure, and plant winter green manure if you can plant winter green manure. Green manure should be planted all year round. Second, vigorously solve the seed problem. Enough seeds must be reserved. Effective measures should be taken to encourage communes and brigades to reserve seeds. Third, actively increase the yield per unit area. To increase yield per unit area, we must also grasp three links: one is rational close planting, the second is to use fertilizer to nourish fertilizer, and the third is intensive cultivation and meticulous farming.
    Top dressing is also an issue that cannot be ignored. For some crops, such as rape and rice, top dressing is an indispensable link. In the past, we mainly relied on four types of fertilizer for top dressing: grass pond mud, human and animal manure, local chemical fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer. However, the fertilizer effect of grass pond mud is slow, and there is a certain limit to human and animal manure and chemical fertilizer. Now it seems that the most promising and effective fertilizer is local chemical fertilizer. Communes must set up factories to vigorously carry out the movement to manufacture local chemical fertilizer.
    In practical work, there will definitely be more ways to accumulate and produce fertilizer. The problem now is to inspire everyone to further study, analyze, and pay attention to the fertilizer problem, take immediate action to plant summer green manure, reserve enough seeds for winter green manure, and raise pigs in large numbers. After the summer harvest and planting are over, launch a fertilizer accumulation movement such as collecting aquatic plants, cutting green grass, and accumulating grass pond mud to ensure the needs of top dressing for autumn crops and prepare sufficient base fertilizer for autumn sowing.
    Since the problem of accumulating and producing fertilizer is a major issue related to the early realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development, the Party's leadership must be strengthened and comprehensive planning must be carried out; after the summer harvest and planting, a large-scale production movement centered on fertilizer production and accumulation must be launched.

### 大抓肥料

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    大抓肥料
    江苏新华日报6月4日发表“像抓水利一样大抓肥料”的社论，摘要如下：
    大家都知道肥料是农作物的粮食，是农业增产的一个重要因素。大跃进以来，各地贯彻农业八字宪法，一般是比较全面的，有很大成绩。如果我们再把这八个字进行一番比较，就会发现，在全省大多数地区，肥料不足是最突出的问题。
    怎样解决肥料问题呢？抓什么肥料呢？“重施基肥，巧施追肥”，是农业生产上多年积累的经验。这就是说，应该着重地解决基肥问题。在基肥中，又应着重抓厩肥、绿肥等精肥。当前的实际情况是，基肥的数量质量都不足，在很多地方，基肥主要是河泥、熏土、堆肥、汪淤、墙头土等，总之，主要都是泥肥，用草肥、厩肥等精肥作基肥的数量较少。当然，在精肥不足的情况下，多搞些泥肥是极为必要的。但是，泥肥费劳力多，效果小，单靠泥肥是不能解决问题的。必须在继续抓好粗肥（泥肥）的同时，采取一切有效措施，迅速改变精肥不足的状况。
    我省的精肥肥源是充分的，门路多得很。种绿肥、积厩肥、搞水生绿肥的条件是极为有利的，全省还有较多的城镇肥料可以利用。
    积造精肥的一条重要措施，就是积极发展以猪为首的畜牧业生产。养一头猪，一年可以积肥三十担到六十担，可以垩两三亩地。因此，必须加速生猪和其它大家畜的发展。如果全省养猪首先达到滨海县的现有水平，每户平均三头猪，就可以积大量的精肥。我们必须大抓畜牧业生产，大积厩肥，逐步改变当前精肥不足的状况。
    绿肥，全省到处都可以种，这是解决肥料问题的主要办法之一。绿肥的潜力很大，必须抓好。发展绿肥必须切实解决三个关键性的问题。第一是抓面积。扩大绿肥面积的中心问题是合理的安排茬口。能单种的就单种，能间种的就间种，能种夏绿肥的就种夏绿肥，能种春绿肥的就种春绿肥，能种越冬绿肥的就种越冬绿肥，要一年四季都种绿肥。第二，大力解决种子问题。种子一定要留足。要采取有效措施，鼓励公社、大队留种。第三是积极提高单位面积产量。提高单产也要抓住三个环节，一是合理密植，二是以肥养肥，三是精耕细作。
    追肥，也是一个不容忽视的问题。有些农作物，如油菜、水稻等，追肥是一个不可缺少的环节。我们过去追肥主要是靠四种肥料，一是草塘肥，二是人粪尿，三是土化肥，四是化肥。但是，草塘泥的肥效慢，人粪尿和化肥有一定的限度，现在看来，出路最为广阔、肥效较好的还是土化肥，必须社社办厂，大力开展制造土化肥的运动。
    在实际工作中，积肥造肥的门路一定会更多。现在的问题是，启发大家去进一步研究、分析和重视肥料问题，立即行动起来，把夏绿肥种下去，把越冬绿肥的种子留足，大养其猪。在夏收夏种结束以后，开展一个捞水草、刈青草、积草塘泥等积肥运动，保证秋熟作物追肥的需要，并为秋播准备足够的基肥。
    积肥造肥问题，既然是关系到提前实现农业发展纲要的一件大事，这就必须加强党的领导，进行全面规划；必须在夏收夏种以后，开展一个以造肥积肥为中心的大规模的生产运动。
