    Learning Mandarin in the Train Car
    To the Editor:
    I transferred from Beijing on express train number 41 (Beijing to Taiyuan) to visit my son in Shijiazhuang who is ill. After the train slowly pulled out of the station, the sky darkened, and the sounds of people talking and laughing gradually quieted down along with the sound of the train wheels. Some passengers even dozed off. Suddenly, the train car's loudspeaker broadcast a crosstalk promoting Mandarin Chinese, and the announcer introduced the benefits of learning Mandarin to the passengers. At this point, the passengers' spirits were lifted again. A conductor pointed to the phonetic alphabet chart that had been set up in advance, and the announcer led the passengers in reading through the loudspeaker. The passengers were very interested, and their voices grew louder and louder as they read. Some people even read and wrote at the same time. I am from the South, and I had always mispronounced some words while teaching myself the phonetic alphabet, but this time I was corrected.
    In the train car, this short cultural lesson was unanimously praised by the passengers.

### 在车厢里学习普通话

    在车厢里学习普通话编辑同志：
    我由北京转乘四十一次（北京至太原）的快车，去石家庄看望儿子的病。当列车徐徐地开出车站以后，天色将晚，这时人们谈笑的声音跟随着车轮转动的声音慢慢静下来了，有些旅客甚至打起了瞌睡。忽然车厢里的播音器播送推广普通话的相声，广播员向旅客介绍学习普通话的好处。这时旅客的情绪又兴奋起来了，一位乘务员指着预先设置的注音识字字母表，广播员通过播音器，领着旅客们读。旅客们兴趣很大，读声越来越高，有的人还边读边写。我是南方人，在自修注音识字中有些字读音一直不正确，这次却得到了纠正。
    在车厢里，这一节为时不长的文化课，获得了旅客们一致的好评。
  　刘晓海
