Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest dispatch: The Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party continued on the afternoon of the 22nd. Representatives of fraternal parties delivered congratulatory messages to the congress.

The head of the Albanian Labor Party delegation, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Kambo, said in his congratulatory message that the socialist camp is growing stronger, while the situation of imperialism is getting worse. The destruction of the Paris Four-Power Summit by U.S. imperialism was not accidental, and it will continue to create international tensions in the future. Imperialism is preparing for war, therefore, it is necessary to constantly expose imperialism.

Kambo then spoke of the need to expose the traitors to Marxism-Leninism and the Yugoslav revisionists. He said that the Communists and people of Albania believe that Yugoslav revisionism is a danger to the entire communist movement and the international workers' movement, and it has become a running dog used by U.S. imperialism to undermine the unity of the working class and the national liberation movement. Albanian Communists resolutely expose revisionism in order to defend Marxism-Leninism. The unbreakable unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union will crush any conspiracy of the enemy and guarantee our victory after victory.

The head of the Korean Workers' Party delegation, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Kim Chang-man, first praised the achievements of the Romanian people in his congratulatory message. He expressed his gratitude for the help Romania gave to the Korean people.

He said that due to the struggle of the South Korean people, Syngman Rhee fell. As long as the people unite and awaken, their struggle can be victorious. The "strength" policy of U.S. imperialism will inevitably fail in the face of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The Korean people will not stop fighting and will continue to be vigilant. The unity and strength of the socialist camp is the greatest guarantee of victory. Although revisionists are trying their best to undermine this unity, their illusions will burst like soap bubbles.

The head of the Polish United Workers' Party delegation, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Ochab, said in his congratulatory message that the imperialist aggressive groups have been exposed. We tell the masses that the essence of imperialism has not changed, but the balance of power has changed, and we can deal with imperialism.

The head of the Vietnamese Labor Party delegation, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Le Duan, said in his congratulatory message that the Romanian Workers' Party pays great attention to strengthening the unity of the Party and the people, and strengthening friendship and cooperation with socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The Romanian people tirelessly struggle for peace and the friendship of all peoples. Le Duan also condemned the U.S. imperialist aggression in South Vietnam in his speech. He said that the Vietnamese people are determined to oppose the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, and to fight for the reunification of the motherland.

The head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party delegation, Politburo member and Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party, Dugersuren, said in his congratulatory message that the remarkable achievements of the Romanian people in socialist construction and the achievements of the people of other countries in the socialist camp encourage the enthusiasm of the Mongolian people to build socialism. After talking about the achievements of the Mongolian people in socialist construction, he said that at present, in the struggle against the enemies of peace and socialism, the most important thing is to unite all peace-loving forces and constantly strengthen the rock-solid unity between the countries of our great socialist camp, and strengthen the unity of the international communist and workers' movement. Neither the tricks of the reactionaries, the conspiracies of revisionism, nor any other conspiracies of the enemies of the international proletariat, can weaken the impact of the invincible Marxist-Leninist thought on the progress and development of human society. No conspiracy can split the international unity of the people of all countries in the world who are fighting for peace, democracy and socialism.

The head of the French Communist Party delegation, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the French Communist Party, Figer, said in his congratulatory message that the outstanding achievements of the Romanian people encourage all honest French people. In discussing the situation in France and the struggle of the Algerian people for freedom and independence, he emphasized that the French people oppose the French government's unjust war in Algeria, just as they opposed the French government's war in Vietnam in the past.

Italian Communist Party representative, Collomb, spoke in his congratulatory message about the difficult situation of the Italian working people and their struggle against U.S. military bases. Collomb said that the struggle of the Japanese people is an example for the Italian people.

At the morning session on the 23rd, the first speaker was Maurer, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian Grand National Assembly. He talked about the role of the people's democratic state and the active participation of the whole people in the construction of the regime. Maurer said that the central issue of any revolution is the issue of political power. The Party plays a leading role in socialist transformation, and the state is one of the important tools in this work. The dictatorship of the proletariat gives the people democratic rights. Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, the form and content of socialist democracy have been constantly developing. The state has taken a series of measures to enable the broad masses of the people to participate in socialist construction and state power work.

Maurer said that the work of the socialist democratic regime will be strengthened, which requires attracting more and more people to participate in this work.

Chairman of the State Planning Commission, G. G. Marin, spoke at the meeting about national electrification, the adoption of new technologies, automation, and other issues.

Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Apostol, focused on the role of trade union organizations in socialist construction in his speech. He pointed out that trade unions are schools of communism and play an important role in eliminating the remnants of capitalist ideology. Now, trade union organizations have become one of the main pillars of socialist construction in Romania. Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, trade unions have paid attention to organizing and carrying out socialist competitions, mobilizing workers to tap potential, catch up with the advanced, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. In 1959 alone, trade union organizations at all levels organized approximately 12,000 experience exchange meetings. In the past four years, employees in the industrial sector have put forward approximately 160,000 innovation proposals, increasing the wealth of the country by approximately 1 billion lei (Romanian currency).

The representative of the Argentinian Communist Party delegation, Secretary of the Buenos Aires Municipal Committee, No. Iscaro, said in his congratulatory message that the Argentine people oppose imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. The Argentine Communist Party, together with other anti-imperialist forces, supports the Cuban revolution. The example of the Cuban revolution has encouraged the struggles of the people of various countries in the Americas.

The head of the British Communist Party delegation, member of the Political Committee of the British Communist Party, Pete Kreegan, spoke in his congratulatory message about the struggle of the British working class to improve living conditions, fight for peace, and oppose American aggressive conspiracies. He emphasized that the British Communist Party is doing everything possible to strengthen the international communist movement and the international workers' movement.

The head of the Swedish Communist Party delegation, Chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, Xi. Hagueburg, said in his congratulatory message that the United States destroyed the Four-Power Summit, which proves that the United States government opposes peace.

Canadian Communist Party representative, member of the National Committee of the Canadian Communist Party, Ann B. Guranik, said at the meeting, "Canada has U.S. military bases, which is a fatal threat to us." The Canadian people condemn the United States for sending "U-2" aircraft to violate the Soviet Union, condemn the war policy of the Canadian government, and demand the removal of American military bases. The Canadian Communist Party has carried out an anti-revisionist struggle, and the revisionists have been defeated.

The head of the Colombian Communist Party delegation, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Colombian Communist Party, Fi. Ba. Hernandez, said in his congratulatory message at the meeting that Colombia, like other countries in Latin America, is ruled by U.S. imperialism. Today, the national consciousness of the Colombian people has been raised, and they are determined to oppose the reactionaries at home and abroad. Hernandez said that the Cuban revolution is of great significance, as it has strengthened the united front against imperialism. The Colombian people support the policies of socialist countries and oppose war provocations. He said that as long as we unite and struggle, we will achieve victory.

The head of the Iranian People's Party delegation, member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the People's Party, Ehsan Tabari, said in his congratulatory message that the current Iranian government came to power with the open support of U.S. imperialism. He said that now the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is growing stronger, and the national liberation movement of the people of oppressed countries is flourishing. The Iranian People's Party is leading the Iranian people to continue their struggle. The Iranian People's Party fully supports the peace-loving policies pursued by the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union.

At the morning session on the 23rd, representatives of fraternal parties from New Zealand, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland also delivered congratulatory messages to the conference.

    毛雷尔和阿波斯托尔发言谈政权建设和工会工作
    阿、朝、波、越、蒙等十余个兄弟党代表致贺词
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　在罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会22日下午会议上，一些兄弟党的代表先后在大会上致了贺词。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员卡博在向大会致贺词时说，社会主义阵营日益强大，而帝国主义的情况愈来愈糟。美帝国主义破坏巴黎四国政府首脑会议不是偶然的，它今后还会制造国际紧张局势。帝国主义在准备战争，因此，要不断地揭露帝国主义。
    卡博接着谈到了揭露马克思列宁主义的叛徒、揭露南斯拉夫修正主义的必要性。他说，阿尔巴尼亚的共产党人和人民认为，南斯拉夫修正主义是整个共产主义运动和国际工人运动的危险，它已成为美帝国主义用来破坏工人阶级的团结和民族解放运动的走狗。阿尔巴尼亚共产党人为了保卫马克思列宁主义而坚决地揭露修正主义。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结，将会粉碎敌人的任何阴谋，将保证我们从胜利走向胜利。
    朝鲜劳动党代表团团长、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满在致贺词时首先赞扬了罗马尼亚人民所取得的成就。他对罗马尼亚给予朝鲜人民的帮助表示感谢。
    他说，由于南朝鲜人民的斗争，李承晚垮台了。只要人民团结和觉醒起来，他们的斗争就能取得胜利。美帝国主义的“实力”政策在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营面前必将遭到失败。朝鲜人民将不停止斗争，将继续提高警惕。社会主义阵营的团结和强大是胜利的最大保证，尽管修正主义者竭力破坏这种团结，但是他们的幻想必将像肥皂泡一样破灭。
    波兰统一工人党代表团团长、波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员奥哈布在致贺词时说，帝国主义侵略集团已被揭露。我们告诉群众，帝国主义的本质没有改变，但是力量对比起了变化，我们能对付帝国主义。
    越南劳动党代表团团长、越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋致贺词说，罗马尼亚工人党十分注意加强党和人民的团结，加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的友谊和合作。罗马尼亚人民不倦地为和平和各国人民的友谊而斗争。黎笋在讲话中还谴责了美帝国主义在南越的侵略行动。他说，越南人民坚决反对美帝国主义者和它的走狗，为祖国的统一而斗争。
    蒙古人民革命党代表团团长、人民革命党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记杜格苏伦致贺词说，罗马尼亚人民在社会主义建设中所取得的显著成就和社会主义阵营其他各国人民所取得的成就鼓舞着蒙古人民建设社会主义的热情。他在谈到蒙古人民在社会主义建设中所取得的成就后说，目前，在反对和平和社会主义的敌人的斗争中，最重要的是团结一切爱好和平的力量和不断地加强我们伟大的社会主义阵营各国之间的磐石般的团结，并加强国际共产主义和工人运动队伍的团结。无论是反动派的诡计、修正主义的阴谋以及其他一切国际无产阶级敌人的阴谋，都不能削弱战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想对人类社会的进步与发展所起的影响。没有任何一种阴谋可以分裂为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的世界各国人民的国际团结。
    法国共产党代表团团长、法共中央书记处书记斐盖尔在致贺词时说，罗马尼亚人民所取得的卓越成就，鼓舞了一切正直的法国人。他在谈到法国的局势和阿尔及利亚人民争取自由与独立的斗争时强调指出，法国人民像反对法国政府过去在越南进行的战争一样，反对法国政府在阿尔及利亚进行的非正义的战争。
    意大利共产党代表科隆比在贺词中谈到了意大利劳动人民的困难处境和他们反对美国军事基地的斗争。科隆比说，日本人民的斗争是意大利人民的榜样。
    在23日上午会议上，第一个发言的是罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团主席毛雷尔。他谈到了人民民主国家的作用和全国人民积极参加政权建设的情况。毛雷尔说，任何革命的中心问题是政权问题。党在社会主义改造工作中起着领导作用，而国家是这一工作中的重要工具之一。无产阶级专政给予人民以民主权利。罗马尼亚工人党“二大”以来，社会主义民主的形式和内容都有了不断的发展。国家采取了一系列措施使广大人民群众参加社会主义建设和国家政权工作。
    毛雷尔说，社会主义民主政权的工作将加强，这就需要吸引愈来愈多的群众参加这一工作。
    国家计划委员会主席格·加·马林在会上谈到国家电气化、采用新技术、自动化等问题。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员阿波斯托尔在发言中着重谈到了工会组织在社会主义建设中的作用。他指出，工会是共产主义的学校，在消灭资本主义思想残余方面起着重要作用。现在，工会组织已成为罗马尼亚社会主义建设中的主要支柱之一。罗马尼亚工人党“二大”以来，工会注意组织和开展社会主义竞赛，发动职工们挖掘潜力，赶先进，增加生产，提高质量，降低成本。仅在1959年一年中，各级工会组织就曾组织了约一万二千次经验交流会议。近四年来，工业部门的职工们共提出了约十六万条革新建议，为国家增加了约十亿列伊（罗币）的财富。
    阿根廷共产党代表团代表、布宜诺斯艾利斯市委书记诺·伊斯卡罗在会上致贺词说，阿根廷人民反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义。阿共和其他反帝力量一起支持古巴的革命。古巴的革命榜样鼓舞了美洲各国人民的斗争。
    英国共产党代表团团长、英共政治委员会委员彼·克里根在贺词中谈到英国工人阶级争取改善生活条件、争取和平和反对美国侵略阴谋的斗争。他强调指出，英国共产党正在尽一切努力来加强国际共产主义运动和国际工人运动。
    瑞典共产党代表团团长、瑞共主席希·哈格堡致贺词时说，美国破坏了四国政府首脑会议，这证明美国政府反对和平。
    加拿大共产党代表、加共全国委员会委员安·布·古拉尼克在会上致词说，加拿大有美国的军事基地，这对我们是一个致命的威胁。加拿大人民谴责美国派“U—2”型飞机侵犯苏联，谴责加拿大政府的战争政策，并要求撤除美国的军事基地。加共进行了反修正主义的斗争，修正主义者已遭到失败。
    哥伦比亚共产党代表团团长、哥共中央执行委员会委员菲·巴·埃尔南德斯在会上致贺词说，哥伦比亚也像拉丁美洲其他国家一样，受到美帝国主义的统治。今天，哥伦比亚人民的民族觉悟提高了，他们坚决反对国内外的反动派。埃尔南德斯说，古巴革命具有重大意义，它加强了反对帝国主义的统一战线。哥伦比亚人民支持社会主义国家的政策，反对战争挑衅。他说，只要团结起来进行斗争，就会取得胜利。
    伊朗人民党代表团团长、人民党中央政治局委员埃赫桑·塔巴里致贺词说，伊朗现政府是在美帝国主义的公开支持下上台的。他说，现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强大，被压迫国家人民的民族解放运动蓬勃发展。伊朗人民党正领导伊朗人民继续进行斗争。伊朗人民党完全支持以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国所执行的爱好和平的政策。
