    The Wider Dissemination of Advanced Experience, the Faster the Improvement of Production Level
    More Than 400 Factories in Liaoning Implement the "Four Eight Cross Operation" System; Hunan's Small and Medium-Sized Towns Promote Cooperative Power Supply and Consumption

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram: Many factories and enterprises in Liaoning Province's iron and steel, machinery, chemical, textile, light industry, and power industry systems are widely promoting the advanced experience of the "Four Eight Cross Operation" system created by the coal industry. To date, more than 400 enterprises across the province have adopted this experience.
    Practice has proven that the "Four Eight Cross Operation" is not only suitable for coal mines and all kinds of mines, but also for all factories and enterprises that operate continuously day and night. After the No. 10 giant blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Works changed its original four-shift rotation system to a "Four Eight Cross Operation" system, the daily output of pig iron increased by more than 400 tons. After workers at the No. 2 and No. 4 electric furnaces of Benxi Steel Plant implemented the "Four Eight Cross Operation" system, the average daily output increased by 12.6% compared to the past, while ensuring production according to variety. A number of machinery industry factories in Shenyang have also achieved significant results after implementing the "Four Eight Cross Operation" experience. Chemical departments, power departments, and railway departments have all saved manpower and improved production efficiency by implementing the "Four Eight Cross Operation" system.
    According to this newspaper, a power reform movement centered on cooperative power supply and consumption is vigorously developing in various parts of Hunan Province. To date, cities and towns such as Changsha, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Changde, Jishou, Lingling, Hengshan, and Dong'an have achieved loop power supply. Yueyang, Shaoyang, Chenxi, Yuanling and other places are also fully promoting it.
    Since the launch of the cooperative power supply and consumption movement, the province has dismantled and saved a large number of transformers, copper wires, poles, lightning arresters, and electricity meters, solving the power supply problems of 236 units lacking or without electricity. By simplifying line equipment, it has also greatly reduced energy loss. According to statistics from eight cities and towns including Changsha, the annual reduction in power loss can exceed 12 million kilowatt-hours.
    Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to the staff and workers of the province's power supply and consumption system: large and medium-sized cities should quickly achieve large loop power supply; small towns and self-provided power plants should fully realize small loop power supply.

    先进经验传播越广　生产水平提高越快
    辽宁四百多工厂实行四八交叉作业　湖南各中小城镇推行供用电合作化
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省钢铁、机械、化工、纺织、轻工和电力工业系统的许多工厂企业，正在普遍推广煤炭工业部门创造的“四八交叉作业”先进经验。到目前为止，全省已有四百多个企业推广了这一经验。
    实践证明，“四八交叉作业”不仅适用于煤矿和一切矿山，而且也适用于一切昼夜连续生产的工厂企业。鞍钢炼铁厂十号巨型高炉把原来四班轮休制改为四八交叉作业制以后，生铁日产量比过去提高四百多吨。本溪钢厂二号、四号两座电炉的工人执行四八交叉作业制以后，平均日产量比以前提高了12．6％，同时保证了按品种生产。沈阳一批机械工业工厂推行“四八交叉作业”的经验以后，也都收到了极显著的效果。化工部门、电力部门和铁路部门推行四八交叉作业制方法，既节省了人力，又提高了生产效率。
    本报讯　湖南省各地以供用电合作化为中心的电力改革运动正在蓬勃开展。到目前为止，长沙、湘潭、株洲、衡阳、常德、吉首、零陵、衡山、东安等市、镇已经实现了环形供电。岳阳、邵阳、辰溪、沅陵等地也正在全面推行。
    供用电合作化运动开展以来，全省已拆除和节省大批变压器、铜线、杆木、避雷器和电度表等，解决了二百三十六个缺电无电单位的供电问题。由于简化了线路设备，还大大减少了电能损失。据长沙等八个市、镇的统计，全年可减少电能损失一千二百多万度。
    最近，中共湖南省委向全省供用电系统的职工提出：各大、中城镇迅速实现大环形供电；小城镇和自备电厂全面实现小环形供电。
