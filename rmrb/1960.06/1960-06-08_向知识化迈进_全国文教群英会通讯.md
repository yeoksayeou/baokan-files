    Marching Towards Knowledge
    ——Report from the National Conference of Cultural and Educational Heroes
  　Our reporter　Yu Huiyin
    On the cultural and educational front of our great motherland, a new and increasingly large force has emerged, and that is the force of hundreds of millions of workers and peasants marching towards knowledge. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of working people have defeated enemies at home and abroad and liberated themselves. After seizing power and becoming masters of their own affairs, they have displayed equally heroic spirit in the battle to capture the fortresses of culture and science. Among the delegates attending this National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, the vast majority are of worker and peasant origin.

    Breaking Through Difficulties, Shedding the Illiteracy Label
    Let's not talk about the factories, mines, and rural areas with better conditions, but first look at how six peasant households in Xiejia Gully overcame numerous difficulties to turn a poor mountain gully into a cultural village.

    Xiejia Gully is a remote village at the foot of Baiyun Mountain in Xingtai County, Hebei Province. Before liberation, thirteen poor peasant households lived here, none of whom were literate. After liberation, the peasants of Xiejia Gully, like peasants all over the country, freed themselves politically and economically, and their desire to learn culture grew stronger day by day. They sent all school-age children to elementary schools in other villages to cultivate the next generation; at the same time, they actively responded to the Party's call to establish year-round people's schools and set up study groups.

    There was not a single literate person in the whole village, so who would teach? They decided to rely on their own efforts. The young peasant Hao Jiusheng was publicly elected to travel over a mountain to a neighboring village's people's school twice a week to learn from experience, learning one or two lessons each time, and then coming back to teach everyone. At the same time, adults and children were organized to seek teachers and friends to learn to read, forming a movement of learning words whenever they saw them and asking questions whenever they saw people. Some peasants went to the market in town and, seeing people playing Chinese chess, learned the character "炮" (pào, cannon) on the chess piece and came back to teach everyone. By the time of the wheat harvest in 1956, all the young and middle-aged people in the village, as well as two elderly people in their fifties, had reached the non-illiterate standard. They, "without leaving the saddle, without stopping the horse," then studied the Chinese language, arithmetic, and abacus of spare-time higher primary schools. After completing the spare-time higher primary school courses in the second half of 1959, they all transferred to spare-time junior high school studies. Now they have completed the first volume of the junior high school Chinese textbook. Young students are also studying junior high school mathematics.

    The more than 800 boatmen of the Linqing Navigation Station in Shandong Province are distributed on 103 sailing boats, navigating day and night on the more than 1,000-kilometer-long Grand Canal, passing through more than 80 docks. According to the decentralized and mobile characteristics of production, they formed study groups by boat, with literate people teaching illiterate people, and more literate people teaching less literate people. Flexible arrangements were also made for study time to ensure that each person had more than eight hours of study time per week. The navigation station also set up tutoring stations in ports with more incoming and outgoing ships and longer berthing times, and each fleet also set up tutoring boats, forming an education network closely combining water and land points and lines, so that workers could learn wherever they went. Originally, illiterates and semi-illiterates in this navigation station accounted for more than 95% of the total number of employees, and there was not a single person with a junior high school education. Now, all young and middle-aged boatmen in the station have shaken off illiteracy, 70% of the newly literate employees are studying in spare-time higher primary schools, and 146 boatmen have been promoted to spare-time junior high school studies. The boatmen happily wrote poems describing their study life: "Busy with production, wearing the stars and moon, We must read articles in our busy lives. The canal is full of the sound of reading, The bow and cabin are classrooms."

    Establishing Spare-Time Universities, Studying Scientific Theories
    Like the peasants of Xiejia Gully and the boatmen of Linqing Station, factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas all over the country are implementing the policy of "combining with production, unified arrangement, flexibility and diversity, and teaching according to aptitude," and organizing spare-time cultural education for the worker-peasant masses. With the development of production and the unfolding of the technical revolution movement, the number of people participating in learning is increasing, and the requirements for learning are also increasing. Simply eliminating illiteracy can no longer meet people's needs. While vigorously eliminating remaining illiteracy and popularizing spare-time elementary education as quickly as possible, various places have been vigorously running spare-time universities and secondary specialized schools. By the first quarter of this year, there were more than 370,000 spare-time university students among workers and staff across the country, doubling the number at the end of last year. The number of students in spare-time secondary specialized schools and spare-time high schools has also increased by 40% and 50% respectively compared to the end of last year. In many large and medium-sized factories, mines, enterprises, and some rural areas, a set of spare-time education system from elementary school to university has been initially formed.

    In the half-work, half-study university run by the Jinxi Machine Factory in Shanxi, worker-born university students are being trained. Half a month ago, the first batch of 43 people graduated. They are all old workers with high awareness, long years of service, and good production, ten of whom were illiterate or semi-illiterate seven years ago. Now their cultural knowledge has basically reached the level of university mechanical and electrical specialties. In many aspects of the ability to solve practical problems, they even surpass ordinary university students. During their study of university courses, this group of worker-university students has combined book knowledge with practical experience and proposed more than 300 technical innovation and technical revolution measures, increasing production efficiency by tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times, and are praised by all the factory employees as "key assault teams."

    Ten years ago, when the young Gou Wenbin first arrived at the Chongqing Enamel Factory as an apprentice, he only had an elementary school education. In the past few years, under the guidance and help of the factory's Party organization, through diligent spare-time self-study, he successively studied many of Chairman Mao's works, junior and senior high school physics and chemistry courses, middle school and university physics and chemistry books related to silicate specialties in higher mathematics, as well as Russian, German, French, Polish and other foreign languages. During the Great Leap Forward, he also cooperated with veteran workers, and on the basis of summarizing practical experience and conducting scientific research, he wrote the missing professional book "Design Principles of Enamel Glaze". After appraisal by the higher-level technical management department, it was considered that this book put forward a new design scheme, explored the secrets of glaze design, and comprehensively expounded the physical and chemical properties of raw materials, which can be used as a teaching reference for enamel factory employees and professional schools. Now Gou Wenbin is the deputy director and engineer of the Chongqing Enamel Factory, and a director of the National Silicate Chemical Society.

    In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province, after basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in 1957 and popularizing spare-time elementary schools in 1958, a complete set of farmer spare-time education system from elementary school to university was initially formed. Each people's commune in the autonomous prefecture has an average of 30 young and middle-aged people with university or university graduate degrees. The 74 farmer university students in the second grade of the Liming Spare-time Agricultural University of Dongsheng People's Commune in Yanji County, combined production and study, and carried out a series of scientific research. According to Michurin's theory that grafting cold-zone apples can improve cold resistance and improve varieties, they grafted wild grapes and domestic grapes from within the pass, solving the problem that local cold weather prevented grapes from overwintering. They also wrote more than 130 scientific papers, some of which have been published, and have been valued by scientific units and farmers.

    Studying Chairman Mao's Works, Arming Our Minds
    The improvement of cultural level has also promoted the development of theoretical study. Tens of millions of workers and peasants have been invested in the movement to study Marxism-Leninism and study Mao Zedong's works, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and guide their thoughts and work. They said: "Chairman Mao's works are carried with us, time is squeezed out, drops of water become the vast sea, and we vow to be red scholars."

    All levels and types of worker spare-time schools are closely cooperating with the current technical revolution movement and are conducting extensive research and experiments in reforming the school system, teaching content, teaching materials, and teaching methods. The Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory combines the factory's production, worker spare-time education, and scientific research. In cooperation with the scientific research of workers improving dyeing tanks, the spare-time school taught the electricity part of physics in advance. According to the electromagnetic principle they had just learned, the students quickly created an automatically directional dyeing tank controlled by electromagnetism, reducing half of the labor force, while improving the quality of colored cloth, and the first-class product rate averaged more than 99%. The first worker spare-time middle school in Jing'an District, Shanghai, launched teachers and students to carry out teaching reforms. In the past two months, the students have dedicated a total of 2,500 "treasures," solving more than 900 difficult problems in the technical revolution. The school also held various short-term professional training classes and lectures to popularize the scientific and technological knowledge urgently needed in production and the technical revolution, and to consolidate, improve, and promote the results of the technical revolution.

    Countless facts prove that the broad masses of workers and peasants under the leadership of the Party, once they master culture and science and become the masters of culture and science, are like galloping horses with wings added. Their rich practical experience and endless creative spirit will be more fully brought into play, and will promote the leap forward of our socialist construction.

    向知识化迈进
    ——全国文教群英会通讯
  　本报记者　余辉音
    在我们伟大祖国的文化教育战线上，出现了一支新生的越来越壮大的队伍，这就是亿万工农向知识化迈进的队伍。广大劳动人民，在党的领导下，战胜了国内外敌人，解放了自己。他们掌握政权，当家作主以后，在攻占文化科学堡垒的战斗中，同样显示了无比英勇的气概。出席这次全国文教先进工作者代表大会的代表中，工人和农民出身的就占绝大多数。
    突破重重困难　摘掉文盲帽子
    且不说那些条件较好的工矿农村，先看看谢家沟六户农民怎样克服重重困难把穷山沟变成文化村吧。
    谢家沟是河北省邢台县白云山下一个偏僻小村。解放前这里住有十三户贫苦农民，没有一个识字的。解放后，谢家沟的农民和全国农民一样，从政治上、经济上翻了身，学习文化的要求一天比一天迫切。他们一面把学龄儿童都送入外村小学，好好培养下一代；一面积极响应党提出的建立常年民校的号召，建立了学习小组。
    全村没有一个识字人，谁来教呢？他们决定自力更生。公推青年农民郝九生每周两次翻一道山到邻村民校取经，每次学一、二课书，回来教大家。同时大人小孩都组织起来，寻师访友来识字，形成了一个见字就学，见人就问的运动。有的农民在镇上赶集，看见人家下象棋，就把棋子上的“炮”字学会，回来教给大家。到1956年麦收前，村内的青壮年和两个五十来岁的老年，全都达到非文盲标准。他们“人不离鞍，马不停蹄”，接着又学习了业余高小的语文、算术和珠算。1959年下半年学完了业余高小课程后，又全部转入了业余初中学习。现在已学完了初中语文课本第一册。青年学员还在学初中数学。
    山东临清航运站的八百多名船工，分布在一百零三条帆船上，他们在一千多公里长的运河上昼夜航行，途经八十多个码头。他们根据分散流动的生产特点，以船为单位成立学习小组，由识字的教不识字的，识字多的教识字少的。在学习时间上也作了机动灵活的安排，保证每人每周有八小时以上的学习时间。航运站还在进出船只较多、停泊时间较长的港口设立了辅导站，各船队也都设立了辅导船，形成了一个水、陆点线密切结合的教育网，工人走到那里，学到那里。原来，这个航运站的文盲半文盲占职工总数95％以上，初中程度的一个没有。现在，全站青壮年船工已全部摆脱文盲，70％的脱盲职工在业余高小学习，还有一百四十六名船工升入业余初中学习。船工们高兴地写诗描述了自己的学习生活：“披星戴月生产忙，要在忙里读文章。河道一片读书声，船头船舱当课堂。”
    创办业余大学　攻研科学理论
    和谢家沟的农民、临清站的船工一样，全国各地工厂、矿山、企业、农村，到处都在贯彻执行“结合生产，统一安排，灵活多样，因材施教”的方针，组织工农群众的业余文化教育。随着生产的发展和技术革命运动的开展，参加学习的人数愈来愈多，学习的要求也愈来愈高。单单是扫盲识字，已经远远不能满足人们的需要了。各地在大力扫除剩余文盲、尽可能及时普及业余初等教育的同时，已在大办业余大学和中等专业学校。到今年第一季度，全国职工业余大学生已有三十七万多人，比去年年底翻了一番。业余中等专业学校和业余高中的学员，也比去年年底增加了四成和五成。在许多大、中型厂矿企业和部分农村，已经初步形成了从小学到大学的一套业余教育体系。
    在山西晋西机器厂举办的半工半读大学里，正在培训着工人出身的大学生。半个月前，第一批四十三人已经毕业。他们都是觉悟高、工龄长、生产好的老工人，其中有十个人在七年前还是文盲或半文盲，现在的文化知识基本上已达到大学机械、电机专科的水平。在解决实际问题能力的许多方面，更超过一般大学生。这批工人大学生在学习大学课程期间，已经把书本知识和实践经验结合起来，提出了三百多项技术革新和技术革命措施，使生产效率增长几十倍、几百倍以至成千倍，被全厂职工誉为“关键突击队”。
    十年前，年轻的苟文彬刚到重庆搪瓷厂当学徒工时，只有小学的文化水平。几年来，他在工厂党组织的指导和帮助下，通过刻苦的业余自修，陆续学习了毛主席的许多著作、初中高中理化课程、高等数学有关硅酸盐专业的中学和大学理化书籍，以及俄、德、法、波等外国语。在大跃进中，他还和老工人合作，在总结实践经验和进行科学研究的基础上，写出了缺门的专业书籍“搪瓷瓷釉设计原理”。经过上级技术管理部门鉴定，认为这本书提出了新的设计方案，探讨了瓷釉设计的秘密，比较全面地阐述了原材料的物理和化学性能，可供搪瓷厂职工和专业学校教学参考。现在苟文彬已经是重庆搪瓷厂副厂长兼工程师，全国硅酸盐化学学会理事。
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州，在1957年基本上扫除青壮年文盲，1958年普及业余小学以后，初步形成了由小学到大学的一套完整的农民业余教育体系。自治州的每个人民公社平均有三十个大学程度和大学毕业程度的青壮年。延吉县东盛人民公社黎明业余农业大学二年级的七十四名农民大学生，结合生产和学习，开展了一系列的科学研究。他们根据米丘林的寒带苹果接枝后可以提高抗寒能力和改良品种的学说，用野生葡萄和关内的家葡萄接枝，解决了当地天气寒冷葡萄不能过冬的问题。他们还写出了一百三十多篇科学论文，有些已经刊登和出版，受到科学单位和农民群众的重视。
    学习毛主席著作　武装自己头脑
    文化水平的提高，还推动了理论学习的开展。已有几千万工农群众投入了学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作的运动，自觉地运用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，指导自己的思想和工作。他们说：“毛主席著作随身带，时间挤出来，滴水成沧海，誓当红秀才”。    
    各级各类职工业余学校，正紧密配合当前的技术革命运动，在改革学制、教学内容、教材、教学方法等方面，广泛进行研究和试验。青岛印染厂把厂内的生产、职工业余教育和科学研究结合起来。配合职工们改进染缸的科学研究，业余学校提前讲授了物理学中的电学部分。学生根据刚刚学到的电磁原理，很快创制成功由电磁控制的自动调动方向的染缸，减少了一半劳动力，同时提高了色布质量，一等品率平均达到99％以上。上海静安区第一职工业余中学，发动师生进行教学改革，两个月来，学生一共献出了二千五百件“宝”，解决了技术革命中的九百多个困难问题。学校还举办了各种短期的专业训练班和讲座，普及生产和技术革命中迫切需要的科学技术知识，巩固提高和推广技术革命的成果。
    数不清的事实证明，党领导下的广大工农群众，一旦掌握了文化科学，成为文化科学的主人，就好比奔腾中的骏马频添了双翼。他们丰富的实践经验和无穷无尽的创造精神，将要更加充分地发挥出来，推动我们的社会主义建设事业飞跃前进。
