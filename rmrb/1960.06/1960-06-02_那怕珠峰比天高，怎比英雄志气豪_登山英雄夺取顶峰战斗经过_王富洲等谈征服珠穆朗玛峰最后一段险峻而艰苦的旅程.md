Xinhua News Agency, Mount Everest, June 1st. Three climbing heroes who reached the world's highest peak, upon returning to the Chinese Mountaineering Team's base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level, recounted to Xinhua News Agency reporters the thrilling battle to conquer the summit.

At 9:30 AM Beijing time on May 24th, athletes Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, Liu Lianman, and first-class athlete Gonbu, left the Chinese Mountaineering Team's last camp, the "Assault Camp," located on the slope of Mount Everest at 8,500 meters above sea level, and began the final treacherous and arduous journey to conquer Mount Everest.

Not long after they set off, they encountered the famous "Second Step" that had thwarted the British "expedition" twenty or thirty years ago—a rock wall located between 8,570 meters and 8,600 meters above sea level, with an average slope of 60 to 70 degrees.

As the four of them struggled to climb near the top of the "Second Step," they encountered the final approximately three-meter vertical and smooth rock wall. At this time, Liu Lianman, a firefighter from Harbin, led the way, reaching into the rock crevices with his hands and stepping on the rock face with his toes to climb upwards, but failed four times. It was then decided to use the "human ladder" method, allowing his comrades to climb by stepping on his shoulders. When they all reached the top of the "Second Step," they realized that this vertical and smooth rock wall of about three meters had taken them three hours.

That evening, when they ascended to an altitude of 8,700 meters, they had very little artificial oxygen left. Liu Lianman was extremely exhausted due to overexertion. Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Liu Lianman, three Communist Party members, immediately stopped to hold a Party group meeting, deciding that Liu Lianman would stay behind, and Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu would continue forward.

It was already dark, and the three of them relied on the faint starlight to stubbornly continue forward.

Late at night, when they reached 8,830 meters above sea level, the artificial oxygen they had brought was completely used up. They were silent for a moment. Wang Fuzhou spoke first: The oxygen is gone, but can we retreat! Qu Yinhua and Gonbu firmly said: Continue forward. They threw away the empty oxygen cylinders and continued forward with firm and slow steps.

Headache, blurred vision, shortness of breath, weakness—all the reactions of high-altitude hypoxia cruelly tormented them. They even needed more than half an hour to climb over a one-meter-high rock. But they still encouraged each other to move forward.

After crossing a rocky slope with scattered white snow, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu finally reached the summit. Looking around, in the hazy night, the black shadows of the Himalayan mountain range all lay at their feet. Now, above them, there were only stars, and no more mountains to climb.

They finally completed a feat in human history—climbing the 8,882-meter summit of Mount Everest from the north slope. At this time, the hands of the luminous watch pointed to 4:20 AM Beijing time on May 25th. After nearly nineteen hours of struggle, enduring oxygen deprivation and the torment of freezing temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius, they were extremely exhausted. Wang Fuzhou and Qu Yinhua's limbs were also frostbitten.

However, the joy of victory made them so excited and moved.

The Tibetan team member Gonbu took out a five-star red flag and a small white plaster statue of Chairman Mao that the mountaineers had entrusted him to take to the summit from his backpack. He placed the national flag and the half-length statue of Chairman Mao on a large rock on the northwest side of the summit, and then protected them with small stones.

At this time, Wang Fuzhou groped in the dark and took out a "Sports Diary" notebook, using a black mechanical pencil to write on it:

"Wang Fuzhou and two others conquered Mount Everest.
May 25, 1960, 4:20 AM."

Because it was dark and they could not see clearly, and their hands were frozen by the severe cold, it took Wang Fuzhou about three minutes to write this line of words crookedly.

Gonbu put this memorable piece of paper in a white woolen glove and buried it in a pile of small stones.

Because it was dark, although they brought a movie camera, they could not film the scene at the summit. Only after they descended the mountain and it was dawn did they shoot some footage back at an altitude of 8,700 meters. Here, when they met Liu Lianman again, Liu Lianman gave them the last few dozen liters of artificial oxygen that he had deliberately saved for the three of them to use, and all three of them were moved to tears.

The four warriors joined together again and went down the mountain with difficulty.

At 1:30 PM Beijing time on May 30th, the four of them, together with all the mountaineers, safely returned to the mountaineering team's base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level. From their departure on May 17th to their descent on May 30th, they lived on the world's highest peak for two weeks.

### 那怕珠峰比天高，怎比英雄志气豪  登山英雄夺取顶峰战斗经过  王富洲等谈征服珠穆朗玛峰最后一段险峻而艰苦的旅程

    那怕珠峰比天高，怎比英雄志气豪
    登山英雄夺取顶峰战斗经过
    王富洲等谈征服珠穆朗玛峰最后一段险峻而艰苦的旅程
    新华社珠穆朗玛1日电　三名登上世界最高峰的登山英雄，在返回中国登山队拔海五千一百二十米的大本营后，向新华社记者叙述了这场惊心动魄的夺取顶峰的战斗经过。
    5月24日北京时间九点半，运动健将王富洲、运动健将屈银华、运动健将刘连满和一级运动员贡布四个人，离开中国登山队设在珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千五百米山坡上的最后一个营地——“突击营地”，开始了征服珠穆朗玛峰最后一段险峻而艰苦的旅程。
    他们前进不久，就遇到了二、三十年前曾经使英国“探险队”碰了壁的著名的“第二台阶”——座落在拔海八千五百七十米到八千六百米的之间、平均坡度在六、七十度的岩壁。
    四个人奋力登到接近“第二台阶”顶部时，遇到了最后约三米垂直而光滑的岩壁。这时，来自哈尔滨的消防员刘连满在前面开路，他用双手伸进岩缝，脚尖蹬着岩面向上攀登，但四次攀登四次失败。这时，就决定用搭“人梯”的办法，让战友们踏在他的双肩上进行攀登。当他们全部登上“第二台阶”的顶部时，才发现这垂直光滑的约三米高的岩壁，竟使他们花费了三个小时的时间。
    当天傍晚，当他们上升到拔海八千七百米的高度时，他们带的人造氧气已经剩下很少了。刘连满因为过度疲劳，体力已经非常衰弱。王富洲、屈银华和刘连满这三名共产党员立即停下来举行党小组会，决定刘连满留下，由王富洲、屈银华、贡布三人继续前进。
    天已经黑下，三个人依靠着微弱的星光，顽强地继续前进。
    深夜，当他们到拔海八千八百三十米时，三个人所带的人造氧气已经全部用完，他们沉默了片刻。王富洲首先开口说：氧气没有了，但我们能后退吗！屈银华和贡布坚定地说：继续向前。他们抛掉空氧气筒，用坚定而迟缓的步伐继续向前。
    头痛、眼花、气喘、无力——这一切高山缺氧的反应残酷地折磨着他们。他们甚至攀过一米高的岩石，也需要半个多小时。但他们仍然相互鼓励地前进着。
    在越过一片点点白雪的岩石坡以后，王富洲、屈银华和贡布终于到达了山顶。举目四望，朦胧的夜色中，喜马拉雅山脉群峰的一座座黑影，都伏在他们的脚下。现在，在他们的头上，只有星斗，再也没有可攀登的山岩。
    他们终于完成了人类历史上的创举——沿珠穆朗玛峰的北坡，登上了它拔海八千八百八十二米的顶峰。这时，夜光表的指针正指着5月25日北京时间清晨四点二十分。经过了近十九个小时的搏斗，他们忍受着缺氧和摄氏零下三十多度严寒的煎熬，已经异常疲劳了。王富洲、屈银华的四肢也已受了冻伤。
    但是，胜利的喜悦使他们变得那样兴奋和激动。
    藏族队员贡布从背包里拿出了登山队员们托他带上顶峰的一面五星红旗和一座小型白色毛主席石膏像。他把国旗和毛主席半身塑像，放到顶峰西北边一块大岩石上，然后用细石保护起来。
    这时，王富洲摸着黑，拿出一本“体育日记”本，用黑色自动铅笔在上面写道：
    “王富洲等三人征服了珠峰。
    1960年5月25日四时二十分”。
    因为天色很暗，看不清楚，双手又被严寒冻僵，王富洲花了约三分钟才歪歪斜斜地写完了这行字句。
    贡布把这张值得纪念的纸条放在一只白色羊毛织的手套里，然后埋进了垒垒的细石堆里。
    因为天黑，他们虽然带了电影摄影机，但却没能拍下顶峰的情景。只是在他们下山天亮以后，才在拔海八千七百米的地方往回拍摄了一些镜头。在这里，他们又遇到刘连满时，刘连满把特意保存的最后几十公升人造氧气交给他们三人使用，他们三人都感动得落了泪。
    这四位勇士又汇合一起艰难地下山去了。
    5月30日北京时间十三点半，他们四人和全体登山队员一道，全部安全地回到了山下拔海五千一百二十米的登山队大本营。从5月17日他们出发，到5月30日下山，他们在世界最高峰上生活了两个星期。
