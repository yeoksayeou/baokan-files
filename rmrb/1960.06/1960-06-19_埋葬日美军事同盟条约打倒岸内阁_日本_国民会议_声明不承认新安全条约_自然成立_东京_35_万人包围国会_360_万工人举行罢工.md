Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" issued a statement tonight, saying that it cannot recognize the "natural establishment" of the new "Security Treaty".

Kishi Nobusuke government's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Shiina Etsusaburo, announced at midnight on June 18th that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty", which was forcibly put to a separate vote in the House of Representatives on May 19th, had "naturally come into effect" after thirty days.

The National Council's statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet had not submitted the new "Security Treaty" to the House of Councillors for deliberation after it was separately voted on in the House of Representatives, and then declared its "natural establishment." Such a "passed" treaty is unprecedented in the world. Judging from its content, it is absolutely unacceptable.

The statement said that June 19th is not the day the "Security Treaty" was "passed," but will be the day of the national general mobilization to fatally strike the "Security Treaty." The National Council will continue to fight with the goal of demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th: The Japanese people's patriotic struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet, reached a new climax today, with 350,000 people in Tokyo surrounding the Japanese Diet, holding an unprecedentedly powerful demonstration.

The Kishi Nobusuke government claimed that the new treaty, which was illegally "passed" by the House of Representatives on May 20th, would "naturally come into effect" at midnight today without being "passed" by the House of Councillors. However, the angry masses around the Diet shouted earth-shattering slogans: "Bury the new Security Treaty!" "Overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet!" "Dissolve the Diet immediately!" "Kishi Nobusuke, get lost to Hawaii!" The demonstrators were high in morale. They have greatly strengthened their determination to fight through more than a year of powerful struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the U.S. imperialists.

The first wave of demonstrators today came from all over the country, including 30,000 demonstrators from Hokkaido and Kyushu. They demonstrated around the Diet early in the morning.

Many universities throughout Japan have gone on strike, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. At the University of Tokyo, 6,000 teachers and students held a memorial service this morning for Michiko Kamba, the female student killed by the police. After the meeting, 6,000 teachers and students began to march towards the Diet.

At the same time, 25,000 students held a memorial service for their murdered friend in Hibiya Park. Many professors attended the students' meeting. After the memorial service, teachers and students began to set off and join forces with the demonstrators near the Diet.

At around 2:00 p.m., demonstrators from all walks of life gathered at the wide Miyakezaka Plaza to hold a massive "Down with the Kishi Cabinet, Demand the Dissolution of the Diet, Prevent the Ratification of the Security Treaty, Oppose the Illegal Suppression of the National Congress." When the meeting was announced to be convened at 3:00 p.m., the number of attendees far exceeded 200,000.

Thousands of red flags fluttered in the square, and behind the flags was a huge portrait of Michiko Kamba. Because the square could not accommodate so many people, thousands of people poured into the various streets facing the square. The square was crowded with people, with no space left.

Chairman Nosaka Sanzo of the Communist Party and Chairman Asanuma Inejirō of the Socialist Party spoke at the meeting. Nosaka Sanzo said: We absolutely cannot agree to the forced passage of the Security Treaty in bloodshed and terror. Let us force the Kishi cabinet to step down immediately. Asanuma strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's atrocities in his speech. Their speeches won cheers and thunderous applause from the masses.

Kamba Toshio, the father of the murdered female student, delivered a moving speech, which won warm applause. Michiko Kamba's mother was also on the stage when her husband spoke. Professor Kamba assured the meeting that they would hold back their tears and fight alongside all the Japanese people until the cause for which their daughter sacrificed herself was accomplished.

The meeting passed three resolutions and declarations amid thunderous applause. One resolution demanded the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the treaty. One resolution expressed the deep grief of the Japanese people for the death of the young female student. Another resolution expressed firm opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's bloody suppression of the people's patriotic struggle.

The meeting's declaration said: The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's tyrannical actions on May 19th caused the outbreak of national anger. Scholars, cultural figures, and citizens also stood up hand in hand with workers, farmers, youth, students, and women. Millions of people launched actions across the country, forcing the Kishi cabinet into crisis and preventing Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The declaration expressed anger at the "June 15th" massacre created by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the attack on Socialist Party member Kawakami Jotaro, and other incidents. The declaration said: We will fight resolutely to the end to overthrow the Kishi cabinet and smash the new "Security Treaty," and we will never stop until we achieve peace and democracy.

The resolutions and declarations of the meeting also unanimously declared that although the Kishi Nobusuke government announced that the new "Security Treaty" would "naturally come into effect" at midnight today, the Japanese people will never recognize the validity of this treaty.

After the meeting, the vast masses formed into mighty columns and marched towards the Diet. They joined forces with tens of thousands of demonstrators who had already arrived near the Diet.

Demonstrators also held a powerful protest demonstration in front of Kishi Nobusuke's Prime Minister's residence, as it was said that Kishi Nobusuke and several cabinet members were holding a meeting in the residence. The masses shouted "Down with Kishi Nobusuke!"

While the main force of the demonstration was still near the Diet, thousands of people had already begun to march towards Kishi Nobusuke's residence, six kilometers from the Diet.

In addition, about 5,000 people began to advance towards the downtown area of Tokyo, carrying out a magnificent demonstration. They went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to protest the police's atrocities in killing Michiko Kamba. Traffic in many places in downtown Tokyo was paralyzed.

At the same time, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department deployed 15,000 police officers near the Diet, the Prime Minister's residence, and the US Embassy. These armed police and plainclothes police hid inside the above-mentioned buildings and the walls of the Diet.

Demonstrators are still surrounding the Diet Building, and a very tense atmosphere is enveloping the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th: 3.6 million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a one-hour strike or workplace rally across the country today, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Today's strike is part of the 18th National Unified Action launched by the Japanese people from the 11th to the 19th.

From early this morning, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union held one-hour workplace rallies at 200 post offices. Workers in other industries picketed outside the post offices where the strikes were taking place. The rallies held by these postal workers passed resolutions demanding the overthrow of the Kishi cabinet, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

During the rallies, all postal services were suspended. This is because not only did these 200 post offices hold one-hour rallies, but other post offices also held at least 25-minute workplace rallies.

Members of the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union working in 1,600 post and telecommunications offices also held workplace rallies today.

Members of the 29 unions belonging to the Government Employees' Joint Struggle Conference stopped work at 11:00 a.m. today and participated in rallies against the new "Security Treaty" across the country.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, the National Federation of Printing and Publishing Workers' Unions, and other major unions also participated in today's one-hour strike or workplace rally.

Industrial workers in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures also shortened their working hours to participate in the Tokyo people's rally against the new "Security Treaty."

    岸信介政府官房长官椎名悦三郎18日午夜宣布，在5月19日强迫众议院单独表决的新日美“安全条约”，经过三十天已经“自然成立”。
    国民会议的声明指出，岸信介内阁在众议院单独表决新“安全条约”后，一直没有经过参议院审议就宣布“自然成立”。这样获得“通过”的条约，在全世界是史无前例的。从它的内容看来，也是绝对不能予以承认的。
    声明说，6月19日不是“安全条约”获得“通过”的日子，而将是给“安全条约”以致命打击的国民总奋起的日子。国民会议今后将继续以要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会为目标展开斗争。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”、要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会的爱国斗争今天达到新高潮，东京三十五万群众包围了日本国会，举行空前未有的强大示威。
    岸信介政府声称，5月20日在众议院非法“通过”的新条约，将不经参议院“通过”于今天午夜“自然成立”。但是，在国会周围的愤怒的群众发出震天动地的吼声：“埋葬新安全条约！”、“打倒岸信介内阁！”、“立即解散国会！”、“岸信介滚到夏威夷去！”示威群众斗志昂扬，他们经历了一年多的反对岸信介内阁和美帝国主义者的有力斗争，斗争的决心大大加强。
    今天的第一批示威队伍是来自全国各地，包括北海道和九州的三万名示威者。他们一早就在国会周围示威。
    日本各地的许多大学，都罢课罢教，要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。在东京大学，六千师生于今天上午为被警察杀害的女学生桦美智子举行追悼会。会后，六千名师生开始走向国会。
    同时，二万五千名学生在日比谷公园为他们的被杀害的朋友举行追悼会。许多教授参加了学生的大会。在举行追悼后，师生开始出发，同国会附近的示威者会师。
    在下午两点钟左右，包括各阶层人民的示威者聚集在宽广的三宅坂广场举行声势浩大的“打倒岸内阁、要求解散国会、阻止批准安全条约、反对非法镇压国民大会”。三点钟大会宣布开会时，与会者远远超过二十万人。
    在广场上，成千的红旗飘扬，旗帜后面是桦美智子的巨幅遗像。由于广场容纳不了那么多群众，数以千计的人涌向面对广场的各个街道。广场上挤满了人群，一点空隙也没有。
    共产党主席野坂参三和社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在大会上讲了话。野坂参三说：我们绝对不能同意在流血和恐怖中强行通过安全条约，让我们迫使岸内阁立即下台。浅沼在讲话中强烈谴责了岸信介政府的暴行。他们的讲话博得群众的欢呼和雷动的掌声。
    被杀害的女学生的父亲桦俊雄发表了令人感动的讲话，他的讲话博得热烈的掌声。桦美智子的母亲在丈夫讲话时也在台上。桦教授向大会保证，他们将忍住眼泪同全体日本人民一道斗争，直到他们的女儿为之牺牲的事业完成。
    大会在雷鸣般的掌声中通过三项决议和宣言。一项决议要求岸信介内阁立即辞职、解散国会和废除条约，一项决议表示了日本人民对青年 女学生的死亡的深切悲痛。另一项决议表示坚决反对岸信介政府对人民爱国斗争的血腥镇压。
    大会宣言说：岸信介内阁和自由民主党在5月19日采取的横暴行为使国民的愤怒爆发了。学者、文化界人士、市民也起来同工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女手挽着手，几百万群众在全国展开行动，迫使岸内阁陷于危机，阻止了艾森豪威尔访日。
    宣言对岸信介政府制造的“六·一五”屠杀事件以及袭击社会党议员河上丈太郎事件等表示愤怒。宣言说：我们要为打倒岸内阁，粉碎新“安全条约”，坚决斗争到底，不取得和平和民主绝不停止。
    大会的决议和宣言还一致宣布，尽管岸信介政府宣布新“安全条约”在今天午夜“自然成立”，但是日本人民决不承认这个条约是有效的。
    大会以后，广大群众编成了声势浩大的纵队向国会进发。他们同数以万计的已经到达国会附近的示威者会师。
    示威者还到岸信介的首相官邸前举行了强大的抗议示威，因为据说岸信介和几个内阁成员正在官邸里开会。群众振臂高呼“打倒岸信介！”。
    当示威队伍的主力仍在国会附近时，数以千计的人已开始向离国会六公里的岸信介住宅进发。
    另外约有五千人开始向东京闹区前进，进行气势磅礴的示威。他们到东京都警视厅抗议警察屠杀桦美智子的暴行。东京闹区许多地方的交通陷于瘫痪。
    与此同时，东京都警视厅在国会、首相官邸和美国大使馆附近派驻了一万五千名警察。这些武装警察和便衣警察躲藏在上述建筑物和国会的围墙内。
    示威者仍然在包围着国会大厦，国会周围笼罩着十分紧张的气氛。
