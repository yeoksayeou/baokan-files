Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: Increasingly more young students and professors in Japan are deciding to take action to force the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to step down and immediately dissolve the Diet.

The joint struggle organization composed of more than 40 high school student councils in Tokyo decided at a representative meeting held on the evening of the 13th to mobilize 1,000 high school students to participate in the nationwide unified action on the 15th.

They also issued a statement firmly demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet. The statement indicated that they would do their utmost to participate in the protest struggle to prevent the House of Councillors from forcibly passing the new "Security Treaty."

One hundred and fifty-eight scholars belonging to the Kanto Sociological Society jointly issued a statement on the 13th, also firmly demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet. The statement also stated that they were determined to strive for democracy and academic freedom.

According to the "Sankei Shimbun" report, professors from twenty-seven universities in Kyoto established the "Kyoto Professors Group Demanding Immediate Dissolution of the Diet" on the 13th, deciding to jointly launch actions to safeguard the Japanese Constitution and force the Diet to dissolve immediately. They also decided that, in order to achieve this goal, professors should actively organize propaganda teams to give speeches on the streets and participate in demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: Japanese women are writing letters to newspapers one after another, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's forced passage of the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet, demanding the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet step down and the Diet be dissolved. The editorial department of the "Moment" women's column in the "Asahi Shimbun" evening edition published a batch of such letters.

Michiko Shimura, a junior high school teacher in Tokyo, said in her letter that she had "never participated in strikes and had always taken a bystander attitude towards union activities." She said, "This time is different. Angry feelings naturally make me want to participate in the protest action." Akiko Nakajima, who has been treated in the hospital for a long time due to rheumatism, voluntarily participated in the large demonstration on June 4. She said in her letter, "On this day, I participated in the demonstration for three hours, and my illness relapsed, but I expressed my will."

When publishing these letters, the editorial department of the "Moment" column published a preface on the 13th, pointing out that the editorial department receives 30 to 40 pieces of such opinions on political issues every day, most of which express anger at the Kishi Nobusuke government's violent behavior and demand the dissolution of the Diet. The preface said that it is noteworthy that most of them are writing to the newspaper for the first time to express their will.

The famous female writer Yaeko Nogami published a conversation in the same day's "Moment" column, saying that this attitude of Japanese women means that the lessons and thoughts learned from the painful experience of the last war have been growing in their minds for fifteen years, and women urgently feel that the new "Security Treaty" involves the life and death of their own husbands and children.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: Twenty-eight Japanese children's theater groups and many university professors today issued statements opposing the Diet's approval of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Twenty-eight Japanese famous children's theater groups, such as "Scarecrow Troupe" and "Little Bear Troupe," also announced in a joint statement issued today, "For the happiness and future of children, the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' cannot be recognized."
