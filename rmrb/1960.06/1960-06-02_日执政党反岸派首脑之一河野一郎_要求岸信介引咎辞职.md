Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st - Tokyo News: Ichiro Kono, one of the leaders of the anti-Kishi faction within Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, stated at a press conference yesterday, openly demanding that Nobusuke Kishi resign and dissolve the Diet. He said that Nobusuke Kishi, on the one hand, extended the Diet session and, on the other hand, forcibly passed the new "Security Treaty," which angered the people. Therefore, if the people say "dissolve the Diet," the Prime Minister should take responsibility and dissolve the Diet.

He said that in order to convince the people, the Kishi Cabinet should resign as a way to do so.

Ichiro Kono also said that a considerable number of people agree with the demonstrations against the "Security Treaty," and this must be noted. The Prime Minister needs to conduct "sufficient reflection" on this point.

    日执政党反岸派首脑之一河野一郎
    要求岸信介引咎辞职
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党内反岸派首脑之一河野一郎昨天在记者招待会上发表谈话，公开要求岸信介辞职和解散国会。他说，岸信介一方面延长国会会期，一方面又强行表决了新“安全条约”，这件事激怒了国民。所以如果国民说“解散国会”，首相就应该负起责任，解散国会。
    他说，为了使国民信服，岸内阁实行辞职，也是一个办法。
    河野一郎还说，相当多数的国民对于反对“安全条约”的游行是赞同的，必须注意到这一点。首相在这一点上有必要进行“充分的反省”。
