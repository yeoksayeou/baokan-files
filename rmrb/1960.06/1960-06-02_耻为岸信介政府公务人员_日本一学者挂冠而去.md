Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: Japanese philosopher and commentator, and associate professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tsurumi Shunsuke, submitted his resignation on the afternoon of the 30th, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's use of fascist violence on the midnight of May 19th to forcibly "pass" the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives.

Tsurumi's letter of resignation stated, "Given the situation since May 19th, I am unwilling to serve the Japanese government as a national public servant."

Tsurumi said that his resignation had nothing to do with ideology. He believes that Kishi Nobusuke's forced "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty" in order to cater to Eisenhower's visit to Japan on June 19th was a form of "flattery." He said they had gone too far. There is no other way but to overthrow (them). "I think this is the time when not only those on the left, but also people like me should speak out."

    耻为岸信介政府公务人员
    日本一学者挂冠而去
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本哲学家和评论家、东京工业大学副教授鹤见俊辅在30日下午提出了辞职书，抗议岸信介政府在5月19日午夜用法西斯暴力强使众议院“通过”日美“安全条约”的行为。
    鹤见的辞职书说，“以5月19日以后的情况来说，我不愿意作为国家公务人员，为日本政府服务。”
    鹤见说，他提出辞职同思想是没有关系的。他认为，岸信介强行“批准”新“安全条约”以便迎合6月19日艾森豪威尔访问日本的做法是一种“阿谀”。他说，他们欺人太甚了。除了打倒（他们）以外，没有别的办法。“我认为，目前是这样的时候了，不仅限于站在左派立场的人们，就像我这样的人也应当大声疾呼了。”
