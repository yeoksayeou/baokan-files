    The Plague God Crosses the Street
    2. Forerunners of Thugs

    New York Dispatch: Before Eisenhower’s departure for his foreign tour, secret service agents moved out in advance. They are all burly men, mostly college graduates, with extremely gentle manners, yet they have undergone rigorous training and can use guns and knives with great speed, and swing their limbs... As the president goes abroad for a visit, thugs hurry ahead. Such gentle and courteous people, a group of burly men, can both punch and kick, and wield knives, guns, and big sticks. The president waves his hand with a fake smile, feigning composure as he leaves the palace gate. The people of the world shout "Down with him!" Asia roars, "Drive out the plague god!" He is helpless against the raging storm, the president's heart is in turmoil...
