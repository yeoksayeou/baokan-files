The conference will be adjourned for one day tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: At the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education held yesterday afternoon and today, eleven representatives reported their achievements to the Party and the state in various fields such as education, culture, health, sports, and news. The representatives who spoke unanimously pointed out that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of all undertakings in the motherland, and also the source of all strength in their work. They expressed their firm belief and determination to dedicate all their strength to the socialist cultural and educational cause of the motherland and to continuously advance along the road pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao.

Zhang Zigao, a 74-year-old professor from Tsinghua University, excitedly talked about the most profound experiences he had gained in half a century of educational work, which were: always follow the Communist Party; rely on the masses and the new forces; and use Marxism-Leninism to command professional work and transform the world outlook. This old professor, who gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in January 1959, spoke in detail about the entire process of how, under the leadership of the Party, he transformed from a dispirited old intellectual in the old society into a vanguard fighter of the proletariat. He said that after more than sixty years of tortuous roads, he finally found his glorious destination, which made him even more convinced that only under the leadership of the Party, adhering to ideological transformation, studying Marxism-Leninism, participating in actual struggles, and closely integrating his own destiny with the cause of the Party, is the only correct path for intellectuals.

Gu Chaohao, a representative from the Department of Mathematics at Fudan University, introduced their achievements and experiences in reforming mathematics teaching. Gu Chaohao said that the mathematics teaching reform movement at Fudan University broke through many old frameworks in mathematics teaching and carried out reforms based on the following three requirements: enriching new teaching content based on the needs of socialist construction and the development of modern science; scientifically and reasonably handling the curriculum setting and interrelationships, avoiding unnecessary repetition, fragmentation, and cumbersome content; and guiding mathematics teaching and research with a dialectical materialist viewpoint, breaking away from the metaphysical viewpoint of detachment from reality. Teachers and students, according to the teaching reform plan and the new education plan requirements, have compiled teaching outlines and new teaching materials for various courses, and preliminary trials have begun in some classes, and students feel that the results are very good.

Chen Jun, representative of the People's Daily, spoke on the topic of "News Workers Should Be Promoters," introducing the great leap forward of the People's Daily in the past two years. He said that Chairman Mao put forward instructions on the five major roles of newspapers: organization, encouragement, motivation, criticism, and promotion, when the people of the country had just embarked on the path of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. According to this instruction, the editorial board of the People's Daily called on all staff members of the newspaper to actively improve their political and ideological and professional levels, constantly improve their work, and strive to be good promoters. Over the past two years, under the direct leadership and close care of the Central Committee, the People's Daily has made great progress in domestic and international publicity.

Chen Jun said that the People's Daily has the following preliminary experiences in its work over the past two years: timely, accurate, and systematic propaganda of the Party's principles and policies under the leadership of the Central Committee; enhancing the theoretical and ideological nature of the newspaper, and improving the level of the entire newspaper's propaganda of Marxism-Leninism; further implementing the principle of running newspapers by the whole Party, and more closely connecting with reality and the masses; and launching mass movements and carrying out competitions within the editorial department. Chen Jun said that the achievements made by the People's Daily over the past two years have confirmed this truth: all the things we do correctly are the result of consciously and conscientiously following the Party's instructions; all the issues we promote well are the result of carefully and deeply understanding the Party's principles and policies. Conversely, mistakes and bad results are inevitable.

Tong Erchang, representative of the Surgical Teaching and Research Group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College, introduced the thrilling battle to rescue the class brother Cheng Debao in his speech. Cheng Debao is an advanced producer of the national red flag unit - Hankou Loading and Unloading Station No. 2. On January 14th of this year, he was suddenly crushed by a seventeen-story high pile of rice bags weighing more than 3,000 kilograms, and almost all of his internal organs were severely injured, on the verge of death. Tong Erchang talked about three experiences in the battle to rescue Cheng Debao in his speech. He said that first, the Party's leadership and putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for the final victory of the rescue work; the Party not only points out the direction politically, but also points out the direction professionally, leading us in specific work at all times. Secondly, the success of rescuing Cheng Debao is the result of implementing the Party's mass line and the result of communist collaboration. Thirdly, as long as superstitions are broken, minds are liberated, and integrated treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine is combined, miracles can be created.

Ma Lin, representative of the Third Troupe of the Henan Yu Opera Theatre, said in her speech entitled "Singing to Our Heroic Era with All Our Hearts" that the Third Troupe of the Henan Yu Opera Theatre resolutely follows the path pointed out by the Party, creatively uses the Yu Opera art form to express modern people's lives, and develops opera art. She said that the process of creatively using local opera to express modern life is also a process of continuous ideological revolution under the leadership of the Party. After a series of struggles, the most fundamental and profound experience and lesson learned is that as long as we conscientiously do things in accordance with Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art and advance along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, the work will improve, and the art will improve; if we deviate slightly from Chairman Mao's thought, there will be errors in the work, and failures in the art.

Liu Jintao, from the Hunan Provincial Institute of Parasitic Disease Prevention and Treatment, talked about her deeds in parasitic disease prevention and treatment work over the past four years in her speech entitled "Dedicate Youth to the People's Health Cause." Liu Jintao is a medical assistant who graduated from a secondary health school. In 1958, she and the pioneer team for schistosomiasis prevention and treatment she led went to the suburbs of Chengxiang Town, Yueyang County, to engage in "experimental fields." Under the direct leadership and care of the Provincial Party Committee, closely relying on the masses, and based on the principle of "everything for the patients," they continuously innovated treatment methods and greatly improved treatment efficiency.

Li Zhentang, representative of Zunhua County No. 1 Middle School in Hebei Province, introduced the situation of this school in a remote mountainous area, carrying forward the communist style of daring to think and act, and carrying out in-depth educational revolution and teaching reform in the spirit of "poor sticks running a cooperative". They overcame various difficulties, established a solid production base with a certain scale of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry from scratch, from small to large, and from indigenous to modern, and realized the combination of education and productive labor. Teachers and students participate in various productions according to the courses they teach or learn.

Ren Jiran, an old traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the Subei People's Hospital in Jiangsu Province, said excitedly in his speech today: Although I am sixty-eight years old this year, I have a warm young heart. I will resolutely listen to the Party and serve the people diligently, and be a red doctor of the working class. Ren Jiran's family has practiced medicine for generations, and he is the tenth generation. His son and grandson are also studying medicine. He said that in old China, traditional Chinese medicine was severely ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionary government and was in a dying state. He personally has also experienced vicissitudes, tasted all the bitterness, and suffered the discrimination and exclusion of the old society. After liberation, traditional Chinese medicine has been valued by the Party and the people.

Yang Ruixue, a lecturer at the Changchun Institute of Physical Education, the creator of the group exercise "National Celebration," performed by nearly 10,000 students at the opening ceremony of the First National Games, introduced in detail in his speech today how their creation team created this set of group exercises with a clear theme and diverse forms with the heart of "winning glory for the motherland's sports cause". She said that in the entire creation process, they continuously studied the Party's principles and policies, learning while doing. They watched various literary and artistic performances, consulted with acrobatic troupes, song and dance troupes, and martial arts teams; read magazines, looked at street murals, and even observed Beijing's new and ancient buildings, and so on. It is through these studies and observations that they constantly enriched their nutrition and finally created the first large-scale group exercise in my country involving nearly 10,000 people in history.

Yang Ruixue emphasized when introducing the process of creating the group exercises that the entire process of this work has made us further realize that only by relying on the leadership of the Party and constantly criticizing bourgeois ideology and arming ourselves with proletarian ideology can we make the work move forward continuously.

Li Yinghai, Deputy Director of the Composition Department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, talked about the teaching reforms he has made in theoretical composition and the achievements he has achieved. He said that in the past few years, he has broken the conventions of bourgeois music education in old China, and by studying and researching national music and folk music modes, exploring the harmony issues of folk modes, he gradually opened formal courses in national mode harmony in teaching. Later, he changed all harmony courses to be based on national mode harmony, combined with creation for teaching. After the Great Leap Forward, he boldly suggested opening a basic course in polyphonic writing, combining the original basic courses into one on the basis of national mode harmony, and completely changed the unreasonable phenomena of their mutual isolation and cumbersomeness and repetition. The facts of the past year or so have proved that the direction of this change is correct. Because it conforms to national characteristics and combines theory with practice, it enables learners to quickly master the techniques needed in practical creation, and the quality has been significantly improved.

Li Yinghai said that when he was teaching the composition course, he also went deep into the people's communes with his students under the leadership of the Party branch, participated in mass poetry and song competitions, and went to performing groups for on-site teaching. In the past six months, he has written a lot of mass songs in coordination with political movements and production movements, and collectively created the song "Young Pioneer Chorus".

Gong Meizhen, a teacher at Qingshanqiao Primary School in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, a young woman whose face was burned by rightists but showed a truly beautiful spiritual outlook, used her own touching experience and heroic deeds to illustrate that only the Party can cultivate people into steel-like giants and cultivate them into true heroes; it also illustrates the vast difference in the attitude of the new and old societies towards people. During the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production in 1958, a rightist threw a cigarette butt into a dynamite barrel. Gong Meizhen and her three students were staying nearby at the time. In an instant, the flames burned off her hair and clothes. On the verge of death, a belief controlled this Communist Youth League member: to protect three lives with her own life. She used her body to cover the three children, but she herself was finally burned into a coma. When she woke up, she found that she had been rescued to the hospital. The Party branch of the hospital mobilized a large number of medical staff to do everything possible to rescue her. The county party committee repeatedly instructed the hospital: "As long as Gong Meizhen is cured, there will be money if money is needed, blood if blood is needed, and skin if skin is needed." The hospital director guarded her day and night, and the comrades vied to give her blood transfusions.

When Gong Meizhen returned to her job after her burn injuries were initially healed, the children cared about her health and secretly put eggs, fish, and shrimp in her drawers. Under the inspiration of this heroic teacher, the children made particularly rapid progress in their studies and thinking, and Gong Meizhen also felt more and more glorious and proud to be a people's teacher. Last August, she was gloriously accepted into the Communist Party of China.

This daughter of a landlord's domestic worker before liberation said at the end of her speech, "The Party gave me a second life. Everything I have belongs to the Party. I will always listen to the Party and follow the Party, and dedicate everything I have to the cause of the Party."

    有九位代表在今天的会上发言。他们是：人民日报代表陈浚，武汉医学院第二附属医院外科教研组代表童尔昌，河南省豫剧院三团代表马琳，湖南省寄生虫病防治研究所医士刘锦桃，河北省遵化县第一中学代表李振唐，江苏省苏北人民医院中医任继然，长春体育学院讲师杨瑞雪，上海音乐学院作曲系副主任黎英海，湖南省湘潭县青山桥小学教师龚梅珍。
    明天大会休会一天。
    据新华社6日讯　在昨天下午和今天举行的全国文教先进工作者代表大会上，有十一位代表分别从教育、文化、卫生、体育、新闻等各个方面，向党和国家汇报了他们的成就。发言的代表一致指出，党的领导是祖国各项事业高速度发展的根本保证，也是他们工作中的一切力量的源泉。他们满怀信心地坚决表示：一定要把自己的全部力量献给祖国的社会主义文教事业，沿着党和毛主席指引的道路不断前进。
    七十四岁高龄的清华大学老教授张子高，在大会上激动地谈到他从事教育工作半个世纪所得到几点最深切的体会，这就是：永远跟着共产党走；依靠群众，依靠新生力量；用马克思列宁主义统帅业务，改造世界观。这位在1959年1月光荣参加了中国共产党的老教授详细地谈到自己在党的领导下，由一个在旧社会中意志消沉的旧知识分子转变为无产阶级先锋战士的全部过程。他说，经过六十多年曲折的道路，我终于找到了自己光荣的归宿，这使我更加确信只有在党的领导下，坚持思想改造，学习马克思列宁主义，参加实际斗争，把自己的命运和党的事业紧密地结合在一起，才是知识分子唯一正确的道路。
    复旦大学数学系代表谷超豪在发言中介绍了他们改革数学教学的成就和经验。谷超豪说，复旦大学数学教学改革运动冲破了数学教学工作中许多旧框框，根据下面三个要求进行了改革：依据社会主义建设需要和现代科学发展的情况，充实了许多新的教学内容；科学地、合理地处理课程的设置和相互关系，避免课程不必要的重复、割裂以及内容繁琐等现象；以辩证唯物主义观点指导数学的教学和研究，破除脱离实际以形而上学的观点。师生们根据教学改革方案和新教育计划要求，编写出了各门课程的教学大纲和一部分课程的新教材，目前已开始在一些班级中初步试验，学生们都感到效果很好。
    人民日报代表陈浚以“新闻工作者要做促进派”为题发言，介绍了人民日报两年来大跃进的情况。他说，毛主席在1958年全国人民刚迈开大跃进步伐的时候，就提出了关于报纸的组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动五大作用的指示。人民日报编委会根据这个指示，号召报社全体工作人员积极提高政治思想和业务水平，不断改进工作，努力当好促进派。两年多来，人民日报在中央的直接领导和亲切关怀下，在国内和国际宣传方面，有了很大的进步。
    陈浚说，人民日报两年多的工作有下面一些初步的体会，这就是：在中央领导下及时地准确地系统地宣传党的方针政策；增强报纸的理论性和思想性，提高整个报纸宣传马克思列宁主义的水平；进一步贯彻全党办报方针，更密切地联系实际联系群众；在编辑部内部大搞群众运动，开展评比竞赛。陈浚说，人民日报两年多来所取得的成就，证实了这样一条真理：凡是我们做得正确的事情，一定是自觉地、认真地按照党的指示办的结果；凡是我们宣传得好的问题，一定是细心地深刻地体会党的方针政策的结果。反之，必然产生错误和不好的结果。
    武汉医学院第二附属医院外科教研组代表童尔昌，在发言中介绍了他们抢救阶级兄弟成德保的惊心动魄的战斗经过。成德保是全国红旗单位——汉口装卸二站的先进生产者，今年1月14日，他被突然倒塌的十七层高、重达三千多斤的米袋堆压倒，几乎全部内脏都被严重压伤，濒于死亡。童尔昌在他的发言中谈了他们在这次抢救成德保的战斗中的三点体会。他说，首先，党的领导、政治挂帅，是抢救工作获得最后胜利的根本保证；党不仅在政治上指出方向，在业务上也指出方向，每时每刻地在具体工作中领导我们。其次，抢救成德保的成功，是贯彻党的群众路线的结果，是共产主义大协作的结果。第三，只要破除迷信，解放思想，中西医结合综合治疗，就能够创造奇迹。
    河南豫剧院三团代表马琳在以“尽情地歌唱我们英雄的时代”为题的发言中说，河南豫剧院三团坚决地遵循着党所指出的道路，创造性地运用豫剧艺术形式表现现代人民生活，发展戏曲艺术。她说，创造性地运用地方戏曲表现现代生活的过程，也是在党的领导下，思想上进行不断革命的过程。经过了一系列的斗争，得到一条最根本的最深刻的经验教训就是：只要兢兢业业地按照毛主席的文艺思想办事，按照毛主席指引的道路前进，工作就有起色，艺术就有提高；如果稍微离开了毛主席的思想，工作上就要出错，艺术上就要失败。
    湖南省寄生虫病防治研究所的刘锦桃在她的题为“把青春献给人民的卫生事业”的发言里，谈到了自己四年来在寄生虫病防治工作方面的事迹。刘锦桃是一个中级卫生学校毕业的医士，1958年，她和他领导的防治血吸虫病先锋小组，到岳阳县城厢镇郊区搞“试验田”，在省委的直接领导关怀下，紧紧依靠群众，本着“一切为了病人”的原则，不断革新治疗方法，大大提高了治疗效率。
    河北省遵化县第一中学代表李振唐在发言中介绍了这个在偏僻山区的学校，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，以“穷棒子办社”的精神，深入开展教育革命，进行教学改革的情况。他们克服了各种困难，从无到有，由小到大，由土到洋，建立了包括工业、农业、畜牧业具有一定规模而又巩固的生产基地，实现了教育和生产劳动相结合。教师和学生都是根据所教或所学的课程分别参加各种生产。
    江苏省苏北人民医院老中医任继然今天在发言中激动地说：我今年虽然已经六十八岁，但是我有一颗火热的年轻人的心，我要坚决听党的话，勤勤恳恳为人民服务，做一个工人阶级的红色医师。任继然一家祖传行医，到他是第十代，他的儿子、孙子也在学医。他说，在旧中国，祖国医学受到国民党反动政府的严重摧残，处于奄奄一息的状态。他个人也是历尽沧桑，饱尝辛酸，受尽了旧社会的歧视和排斥。解放以后，中医受到党和人民的重视。
    在第一届全国运动会开幕式上由近万名学生一起表演的名为“全民同庆”的团体操的创编者、长春体育学院讲师杨瑞雪，在今天发言中，详细介绍了他们创编组怎样抱着“为祖国体育事业争光”的心情，克服困难创编了这套主题鲜明、形式多样的团体操。她说，在整个创编过程中，他们不断学习党的方针政策，边作边学。他们看各种文艺演出，到杂技团、歌舞团、武术队请教；看杂志，看街头壁画，甚至观察北京的新型与古老的建筑物，等等。他们就是通过这些学习和观察，不断丰富自己的营养，最后创造出了有史以来我国第一个将近万人参加的大型团体操。
    杨瑞雪在介绍他们创编团体操的经过时强调说，这一工作的全部过程，使我们进一步认识到：只有依靠党的领导和不断地批判资产阶级思想，用无产阶级思想武装自己，才能使工作不断前进。
    上海音乐学院作曲系副主任黎英海在发言中谈到他在理论作曲方面进行教学改革的情况和获得的成绩。他说，几年来，他打破了旧中国资产阶级音乐教育的成规，通过学习和研究民族音乐、研究民间音乐的调式，摸索民间调式的和声问题，逐渐在教学中开办了民族调式和声的正式课程。以后，他又把和声课全部改为以民族调式和声为主，联系创作进行教学。大跃进以后，他又大胆建议开设多声部写作基础课，将原来的几门基础课在民族调式和声的基础上合而为一，彻底改变它们彼此孤立和繁琐、重复的不合理现象。一年多来的事实证明，这种变革的方向是正确的，由于它符合民族特点，理论联系实际，使学的人能较快地掌握到实际创作中所需要的技术，质量显著提高。
    黎英海说，他在担任作曲课教学时，还在党支部领导下，带着同学深入到人民公社，参加群众的赛诗赛歌会，到演出团体进行现场教学，半年来配合政治运动和生产运动，写了不少群众歌曲，并集体创作了“红领巾大合唱”的歌曲。
    湖南省湘潭县青山桥小学教师龚梅珍，一个被右派分子放火烧坏了容貌、但却显出真正美丽的精神面貌的女青年，用她自己的可歌可泣的经历和英勇事迹说明了，只有党才能把人培育成钢铁一样的巨人，培育成真正的英雄；也说明了新旧两个社会对待人的态度是怎样的天差地别。1958年大炼钢铁运动中，一个右派分子把一个烟蒂头扔进了炸药桶里，龚梅珍和她的三个学生当时正住宿在靠近的地方，倾刻间火焰烧掉了她的头发和衣服，在死亡的边缘上，一个信念支配着这个共青团员：用自己的一条生命保住三条生命。她用身体掩护着三个孩子，但她自己终于被烧得昏迷过去，醒来时发现自己已被抢救到医院里，医院的党支部动员了大批医务人员想尽一切办法急救她，县委一再指示医院：“只要治好龚梅珍，要钱有钱，要血有血，要皮有皮。”医院院长夜以继日地守护在她身边，同志们争着为她输血。
    当龚梅珍烧伤初愈回到工作岗位以后，孩子们都关心她的健康，偷偷地把鸡蛋、鱼虾放在她的抽屉里。孩子们在这个英雄教师的感召下，在学习和思想上都进步得特别快，而龚梅珍也因此而更加感到作一个人民教师的光荣和自豪。去年8月，她被光荣地吸收参加了中国共产党。
    这个解放前地主家佣工的女儿在结束她的发言时说，“党给了我第二次生命，我的一切都是属于党的，我要永远听党的话，跟党走，把我的一切献给党的事业。”
