    Party Committee Secretary's Notes:

    Cultural Revolution Rides Dragon and Straddles Phoenix
    Li Ming, First Secretary of the CCP Wanrong County Committee, Shanxi
    Wang Guoying, Secretary of the Secretariat
    Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, cultural flowers are blooming exuberantly in Wanrong County. With the Great Leap Forward in production, the cultural revolution rides the dragon, straddles the phoenix, and soars with wings.
    After achieving phonetic literacy, the county party committee put forward the slogan "Massively run spare-time middle schools, extensively read and write articles," like a spring breeze blowing into every household, like spring thunder echoing across the vast wilderness. Districts established spare-time schools, teams set up classes, forming a network of spare-time education. Xinhua Bookstore was bustling with activity, and 570,000 copies of phonetic reading materials were snapped up by farmers. Farmers carried schoolbags, with four treasures inside (books, newspapers, pens, notebooks). Parents gave books and dictionaries as dowries to their daughters. "The Beggar Becomes a Cultured Person" is an excellent drama, and the playwright Zhang Wu'e used to be a beggar. A year ago, she was still illiterate! The catalog tables of many management district libraries showed tens of thousands of books in stock, but the bookshelves were empty, and the books were circulating outside for a long time, being exchanged and borrowed among farmers. Duan Xiuying, a member of the Zhangyi Management District and mother of four children, studied in her spare time every day and read 178 books in three months. Each farmer in Qinggu Village bought more than 50 books, and some even bought hundreds. In the past, people read picture books and pamphlets, but now they are reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "How to Be a Good Communist" and other works. More than 2,000 farmer-authors have emerged in Wangxian and Sunji communes. Farmers not only write short articles but can also write long ones. "Changes in Qinggu" written by Wang Minying, a student in a spare-time school, "Autobiography" written by Cheng Kuanniu, "Fragments of My Life" written by old man Li Taibai, and "Tour of the Reservoir" written by Yan Lieju are all as long as 10,000 to 50,000 words, written concretely and vividly, with such full emotions! In our era, it is common for working people to write books.
    After mastering culture, farmers have further promoted the Great Leap Forward in production and created more material wealth for society. Young farmer Cheng Kuanniu was known as a "dunce" before he shed his illiteracy, but now that he is literate, he has been elected as the production team leader. Last year, his experimental field overcame a severe drought and five hailstorms and achieved a bumper harvest, with cotton yielding 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu and sweet potatoes yielding more than 6,000 jin per mu. This year, he and everyone else set up a "Garden of One Hundred Flowers" to experiment with various plants. After mastering culture, farmers have liberated their minds, dare to think and act, and brought their wisdom into play, making tool reforms even more enthusiastically. Wang Zhuwa, a carpenter in the Weiyang Management District, invented a deep-well water lifting machine after studying the principle of leverage in spare-time high school, which can lift 960 dans of water from a 520-foot-deep well every day. "Technology is a treasure, but you can't learn it without culture," "Cultural flowers bloom for thousands of miles, and production fruits are fat and big." Farmers correctly understand the relationship between learning culture and production, allowing their learned knowledge to shine brilliantly in the Great Leap Forward in production.
    After the cultural level of farmers has improved, a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works has followed, with 89,000 people in the county involved in the theoretical study movement. While everyone was studying, they suddenly couldn't find the 60-year-old Zhang Qinye. It turned out that she had quietly returned home to smash the clay idol that had deceived her for many years and hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao. After farmers gained cultural and scientific knowledge, they armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and gods, ghosts, fate, etc., were all cleared away in one fell swoop.
    Now, what you see and hear in the countryside is everywhere loud singing, everywhere full of confidence and pride in building a new socialist countryside, everywhere with soaring enthusiasm and high spirits. Mass cultural activities are extensive and in-depth. Farmers create miracles with their own hands, and use the culture they have learned to compose lyrics to praise their miracles. Cheng Shuqian, a 47-year-old woman, felt younger and younger after learning culture and became fond of dancing and singing. She wrote five short plays, including "Ten Sings for the Elderly Class," and personally went on stage to dance and act. The magnificent socialist construction itself is the most beautiful poem, and the beautiful things are as vast as the sea. They have written many beautiful and moving poems and articles. Mass sports activities are also more widely carried out. Most people in the county participate in various forms of physical exercise, and exercise teams of various genders and ages are booming like mushrooms after rain. Wu Wenxue, an old man in Tongai Village, and his family of three generations and six people have all participated in physical exercise, and they are known as the "sports family." Women used to be "golden lilies wrapped under their skirts," but now they "kick their feet and dance their arms to punch."
    Mountains have peaks, but there is no peak in production leap forward; seas have borders, but there is no limit to culture and science. Under the wise leadership of the Party, the 210,000 people of Wanrong County will, with the spirit of continuous revolution, hold high the banner of cultural revolution and continuously move forward!

    文化革命骑龙跨凤
    中共山西万荣县委第一书记　李明
    书记处书记　王国英
    在党的总路线光辉照耀下，万荣县怒放文化花朵。随着生产的大跃进，文化革命骑龙跨凤，插翅高飞。
    在实现注音扫盲之后，县委提出“大办业余中学，大读大写文章”的口号，像春风吹进了每户农家，像春雷响彻在辽阔的原野。区区建业余学校，队队设班级，形成了业余教育网。新华书店门庭若市，五十七万册注音读物，被农民争购一光。农民背书包，包内有四宝
  （书、报、笔、抄本）。娘家给女儿送书本、字典作嫁妆。“乞丐变成文化人”是个优秀剧目，剧作者张五娥，过去就是个乞丐。一年前，他还是个睁眼瞎子呢！许多管理区图书室目录表上存书万册，书架上空空如也，书本长期流动在外，被农民互相交换借阅着。张仪管理区社员段秀英，是四个孩子的妈妈，她每天抽空就学习，三个月阅读了一百七十八本书。青谷村每个农户买书五十余本，多至百本，过去人们读的是连环画，小册子，现在在阅读“毛泽东选集”、“论共产党员的修养”等著作了。王显、孙吉两个公社，出现了两千多名农民作者。农民不只写短篇文章，而且能写长篇。业余学校学员王民英写的“青谷变迁”，程宽牛写的“自传”，李太柏老汉写的“我的生活片断”，阎列菊写的“游水库”等作品，篇幅都长达一万到五万字，写得具体而又生动，感情是那样的充实！在我们的时代里，劳动人民写书已经是平常事了。
    农民在掌握了文化之后，更加促进了生产大跃进，为社会创造更多的物质财富。青年农民程宽牛，在没有摘掉文盲帽子的时候，人称“闷块”，而今脱了盲，被选为生产队长。去年他种的试验田，战胜七旬大旱，五次雹灾，取得丰收，棉花亩产一百三十斤皮棉，红薯亩产六千多斤。今年他和大家一起搞了个“百花园”，作各种植物的试验。农民掌握了文化之后，思想解放了，敢想敢干，发挥了自己的智慧，在工具改革上更搞得热火朝天。卫阳管理区木工王朱娃，在业余高中学习了杠杆原理后，发明了一种深井取水机，从五百二十尺深的水井内，每天可提九百六十担水。“技术是个宝，没有文化学不了”，“文化花开千里香，生产果实肥又大”，农民正确地理解了学习文化和生产之间的关系，使自己学到的知识在生产大跃进中放出了奇光异采。
    农民的文化水平提高后，接着出现了学习毛主席著作的高潮，全县有八万九千多人卷入理论学习运动。大家正在学习时，忽然找不见六十岁的张亲叶老太太了，原来她悄悄回家去第一个摔掉了欺骗自己多年香火、献供的泥胎，挂上了毛主席像。农民有了文化科学知识后，又用毛主席思想武装了自己，神、鬼，命运等等，被一古脑儿清除了。
    现在，农村所见所闻到处是嘹亮的歌声，到处是充满着建设社会主义新农村的信心和自豪，到处是干劲冲天，意气风发。群众性的文艺活动广泛而深入。农民以自己的双手创造奇迹，又用自己学到的文化，编词歌颂自己的奇迹。程淑欠这个四十七岁的老太婆，自从学文化之后，觉得越活越年青，变得爱跳爱唱了，自编“十唱老年班”等五个短剧，亲自登台跳舞演戏。宏伟的社会主义建设，本身就是最美的诗篇，美好的事物浩如烟海。他们写出了许多优美动人的诗文。群众性的体育活动也更为广泛地展开，全县大部分人参加了各种不同形式的体育锻炼，各种不同性别，不同年龄的锻炼队，雨后春笋般地蓬勃发展起来。通爱村吴文学老汉一家三辈六口人，都参加了体育锻炼，人称“体育之家”。妇女们过去是“罗裙下面裹金莲”，而今是“踢脚舞臂会打拳”。
    山高也有顶，生产跃进没有顶；海宽也有边，文化科学无止境。在党的英明领导下，万荣县二十一万人民将以不断革命的精神，高举文化革命的旗帜，不断地迈进！
