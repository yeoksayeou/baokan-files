Chronic Illness and Inevitable Doom: Systemic Corruption and Short Lifespan
The United States Faces a New Economic Crisis

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, New York Dispatch: The economic situation in the United States in the first five months of this year indicates that the shadow of a new economic crisis is approaching.

The Cycle of Crises is Shortening

The decadent American imperialism suffered the impact of three economic crises in the short span of ten years from 1949 to 1958. The cycle of economic crises is shortening more and more. After finally getting rid of the most recent economic crisis in the second half of 1958, the recovery of industrial production in the United States only continued for a little over a year. By the second half of 1959, the speed began to "weaken." At the beginning of this year, stagnation reappeared, followed by continuous declines of varying degrees in many industrial sectors.

Serious Decline in Industrial Production

The most serious declines in production have occurred in the steel and automobile industries, which are the foundations of American industry. After the 116-day steelworkers' strike last year, the steel monopoly capitalists took advantage of the greatly reduced steel inventories to launch a production speculation frenzy, pushing the steel industry operating rate to over 95% at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. However, the steel shortage was quickly filled by this feverish production, and steel production began to decline continuously from February. The steel industry operating rate fell from 95% in January to 85% at the end of March, and then to 61.9% at the end of May. According to estimates by the American Iron and Steel Institute, the national steel industry operating rate will fall to 54.8% this week.

Production and sales of the automobile industry are also declining continuously. In the first quarter of this year, the United States originally planned to produce 2.25 million vehicles, but the actual output was only 2 million vehicles. Automobile production in March decreased by 15% compared to January, and then decreased by 11% in April compared to March. It is estimated that automobile production in the second quarter may decrease by another 16% compared to the first quarter.

Inventory Stagnation and Order Reduction

The inventory volume, which has a direct impact on the prospects of industrial production, has reached a new historical peak. The current steel inventory in the United States has exceeded the storage volume before the steel strike last year. National enterprise inventories have now reached 93 billion US dollars, exceeding the highest level (91.3 billion US dollars) before the start of the 1957 crisis.

With so much inventory, new orders for enterprises will naturally continue to decrease. According to "The Wall Street Journal," as of April, the orders on hand for American manufacturers have been declining for five consecutive months.

The Unemployment Problem is Becoming Increasingly Serious

The serious unemployment problem is developing towards major industrial areas. Areas such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Birmingham have now been listed as severely unemployed areas (unemployment rate above 6%), with Detroit's unemployment rate reaching over 8%, and some severely affected areas even reaching as high as 25%. Unemployment is causing a decline in people's income, and private debt is rising rapidly. According to statistics, consumer credit and mortgage loans alone now account for 53% of the American people's after-tax income.

The Agricultural Crisis Continues to Deepen

The agricultural crisis continues to deepen, with millions of small farmers going bankrupt, a large number of farmers flowing into cities, and rural purchasing power declining sharply. According to reports, the agricultural population in the United States has been declining continuously over the past 25 years, and in the past decade, it has decreased by an average of 500,000 people per year.

The well-known American bourgeois economic expert and former Deputy Director of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Langham, said not long ago, "Based on the current situation, a major economic panic is imminent."

Stepping Up War Preparations to "Stimulate" Production

The American monopoly consortiums that make fortunes from war are trying to cope with the arrival of this new economic crisis by stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. After the United States sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, it hurriedly passed a huge military appropriation of 40.51 billion US dollars in the Senate in the middle of this month, an increase of 1.17 billion US dollars over the original military budget. These measures have caused jubilation in the Wall Street monopoly consortiums. Nelson Rockefeller, a representative of the most powerful monopoly consortium in the United States, recently clamored that the U.S. government should increase military spending by another 3.5 billion US dollars to "stimulate" American production.

### 痼疾缠身难逃厄运  制度腐朽寿命不长  美国面临一场新的经济危机

    痼疾缠身难逃厄运  制度腐朽寿命不长
    美国面临一场新的经济危机
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：今年头五个月美国的经济情况表明，一场新的经济危机的阴影又在逼近。
  危机周期越来越缩短
    腐朽的美帝国主义从1949年到1958年的短短十年间，一连遭受了三次经济危机的冲击。经济危机的周期越益缩短。1958年下半年，美国好容易摆脱最近一次经济危机后，工业生产的回升仅仅继续了一年多，到1959年下半年速度便开始
  “疲软”下来，到今年年初，重新出现了停滞，紧接着许多工业部门生产便开始了幅度不同的连续下降。工业生产严重下降
    生产下降最严重的是作为美国工业基础的钢铁、汽车工业部门。在去年一百一十六天钢铁工人大罢工之后，钢铁垄断资本曾经利用钢铁存货大大减少的机会，掀起了一场生产投机狂，使钢铁工业开工率在去年年底和今年年初曾达到95％以上。但是，钢铁缺货很快便被这种狂热的生产所填满，从2月份开始，钢铁生产便连续下降。钢铁工业开工率从1月份的95％，下降到3月底的85％，到5月底又下降到61．9％。据美国钢铁工业研究所估计，美国全国钢铁工业开工率本周将下跌到54．8％。
    汽车工业的生产和销售量也在不断地下降。今年第一季度美国原拟生产汽车二百二十五万辆，但实际产量只有二百万辆。3月份的汽车生产比1月份下降了15％，4月份又比3月份下降了11％。据估计，第二季度的汽车生产可能比第一季度再下降16％。存货滞销订货减少
    对工业生产前景有直接影响的存货量已经达到了历史的新高峰。目前美国钢铁存货量已经超过了去年钢铁大罢工前的储存量。全国企业存货目前已达到九百三十亿美元，超过了1957年危机开始前的最高水平（九百十三亿美元）。
    存货已如此之多，对企业的新订货单自然要不断减少。据“华尔街日报”报道，到4月份为止，美国制造商手头的订单已经连续下降了五个月。失业问题日益严重
    严重的失业问题正在向主要大工业区发展。底特律、匹兹堡和伯明翰等地区，现在都已被列为严重的失业区（失业比率在6％以上），底特律的失业比率达到8％以上，有些严重的地区甚至高达25％。失业造成人民收入的下降，私人债务迅速上升。据统计，现在仅消费者信贷和抵押借款两项债务已占美国人民纳税后的收入的53％。
    农业危机继续加深
    农业危机仍在继续加深，数以百万计的小农户破产，农民大量流入城市，农村购买力急剧下降。据报道，美国农业人口在过去二十五年来不断下降，而在最近十年中，每年平均减少五十万人。
    美国著名的资产阶级经济专家、前任芝加哥联邦储备局副局长兰格姆不久前说，“根据目前的情况看来，一次重大的经济恐慌即将来临。”
  加紧备战“刺激”生产
    靠战争发财的美国垄断财团又在力图用加紧扩军备战的办法来应付这场新的经济危机的来临。美国在破坏四国政府首脑会议以后，本月中旬急急忙忙地在参议院通过了四百零五亿一千多万美元庞大的军事拨款，比原军事预算增加十一亿七千多万美元。这些措施在华尔街垄断财团中引起了欢腾。美国最有势力的垄断财团代表纳尔逊·洛克菲勒最近叫嚣美国政府应该再把军费增加三十五亿美元，来“刺激”美国的生产。
