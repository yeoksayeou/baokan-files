Xinhua News Agency, Xining Telegram: The Hala Zhigou Commune in the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County of Qinghai Province has launched a socialist labor competition for "Ten-Good" cadres and "Ten-Good" commune members, overfulfilling the sowing tasks and expanding the planting area by more than 50% compared to last year; other work has also achieved an all-round leap forward.

This competition movement in Hala Zhigou Commune began after the commune members' representative meeting in January this year. The meeting put forward the conditions for "Ten-Good" commune members and "Ten-Good" cadres, setting off a wave of competition for everyone to learn from advanced individuals. The competition is closely integrated with production, and evaluations are carried out after each stage of production. After the spring sowing, the commune's first evaluation selected 328 "Ten-Good" cadres and 1,495 "Ten-Good" commune members. Additionally, three production teams and forty households were awarded the honorary titles of "Ten-Good Cadres Full House Red" or "Ten-Good Commune Members Whole Family Red" because all cadres and family members reached the "Ten-Good" standards. Furthermore, seventy-nine units and more than five hundred cadres were commended on the honor roll and blackboard bulletin for outstanding achievements in certain aspects of their work.

The "Ten-Good" competition has extensively mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres and commune members. The work style of cadres has greatly improved, and the excellent qualities of loyalty, vigor, and hard work have been further developed. In the movement of land reclamation, drought prevention and resistance, and spring sowing, the vast majority of the commune's more than seven hundred cadres participated in production and led production.

Because the cadres and commune members are of one heart and one mind, the production and work of Hala Zhigou Commune have achieved great results. The commune's labor force has consistently maintained full attendance, overfulfilling the annual land reclamation task by 3.5% within a month. Afforestation and spring sowing have also been overfulfilled. (Picture attached)

    作十好干部　当十好社员
    哈拉直沟公社开展“十好”竞赛
    据新华社西宁电　青海省互助土族自治县哈拉直沟公社开展“十好”干部、“十好”社员的社会主义劳动竞赛，超额完成了播种任务，种植面积比去年扩大50％以上；其他工作也得到了全面跃进。
    哈拉直沟公社的这一竞赛运动是从今年1月公社社员代表大会后开始的。会上提出了“十好”社员和“十好”干部的条件，掀起了人人学先进的竞赛热潮。竞赛紧密结合生产展开，生产告一段落就进行评比。春播结束后，全社第一次评选出“十好”干部三百二十八名，“十好”社员一千四百九十五名，并有三个生产队和四十户社员，由于全体干部和全家成员都达到“十好”标准，分别受到“十好干部满堂红”或“十好社员全家红”的荣誉奖励。此外，还有七十九个单位和五百多个干部因为某一方面工作成绩突出，在光荣榜和黑板报上得到表扬。
    “十好”竞赛广泛地调动了干部和社员的积极性和创造性。干部工作作风有了很大改进，忠心耿耿、朝气勃勃、艰苦朴素等优秀品质得到进一步发扬。在开荒、防旱抗旱和春播运动中，全社七百多个干部绝大多数都参加生产，领导生产。
    由于干部社员一条心、一股劲，哈拉直沟公社的生产、工作都取得了巨大成绩。全社劳动力经常保持满勤，在一个月时间内就超额3．5％完成全年的开荒任务，造林、春播都已超额完成。（附图片）
