    Japanese people from all walks of life are enthusiastically supporting the general strike.
    Worker Yoshio Tanaka said: General strikes must be held repeatedly until Nobusuke Kishi falls.
    Lecturer Fujiko Isono said: The people's support for the strike shows a great improvement in their awareness.
    Poet Sumako Fukao said: The strike shows the people's anger at Nobusuke Kishi.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: News from Tokyo: People from all walks of life in Japan have issued statements celebrating the victory of the June 4th general strike and expressing their intention to continue the struggle to force Nobusuke Kishi to step down, dissolve the Diet, and crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    A worker named Yoshio Tanaka published his opinion in today's "Mainichi Shimbun," saying that the people must use all their strength to protest against the Nobusuke Kishi government, which tramples on democracy, and repeatedly hold general strikes until Nobusuke Kishi falls.
    Emi Suda, a 26-year-old housewife, said that the June 4th general strike was a way for workers to express our wishes through strikes. She said she was very grateful to the workers.
    Hiroko Kawai, a ward office employee, pointed out that the June 4th general strike was a wave of opposition to Nobusuke Kishi that surged from all the people. She said that they held a meeting at their workplace, which delayed the opening of the ward office by one hour. The citizens who came to the ward office treated them very well.
    Fujiko Isono, a lecturer at Japan Women's University, emphasized that the masses support the strike, which marks a great improvement in the people's political awareness.
    Critic Jun Eto pointed out that citizens expressed sympathy for the strike, which is a frank expression of the Japanese workers and people from all walks of life demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.
    Cartoonist Ryū Takashi said that the June 4th general strike was well-organized, which is good. If Nobusuke Kishi does not step down even at this point, we should pick up our powerful weapon again -- launch a general strike.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: News from Tokyo: Well-known figures from all walks of life in Japan have published comments in newspapers on the June 4th general strike, expressing their support for the workers' strike and condemning the reactionary policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government. Renowned female poet Sumako Fukao published her opinion in the "Sankei Shimbun," saying that the June 4th strike not only showed the anger of Japanese workers but also the anger of all the people at Nobusuke Kishi's lawless behavior. She expressed her joy at the fact that the strike strengthened the unity of people from all walks of life.
    University professor Tanren Fujiwara said that this general strike was a sound strike and an effective way to remind Nobusuke Kishi of his responsibility to the people. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published the opinions of critics Chieko Akiyama and Yujiro Chiba.
    Chieko Akiyama asked Nobusuke Kishi to listen to the people's voices from the June 4th strike.
    Yujiro Chiba pointed out that in the June 4th strike, ordinary train passengers and striking railway workers cooperated, "which shows that dissatisfaction with the government's behavior is a widespread sentiment among the Japanese people now. This also shows that the Japanese people have made astonishing political progress in the past few years."
    Professor Kiyoko Ikeda of Keio University said in a conversation published in the "Tokyo Shimbun" that the strike was supported by the people because it was a strike against the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. She asked politicians to re-examine their attitudes according to the issues illustrated by the June 4th strike.

    今年二十六岁的家庭妇女须田惠美说，六·四总罢工是工人通过罢工表达了我们的意愿。她说，她很感谢工人。
    区公所职员川井弘子指出，六·四总罢工是从全体人民中涌出的反对岸信介的声浪。她说，她们在工作场所举行了大会，使区公所推迟一小时开始办工。前来区公所办事的市民对待他们的态度都很好。

    千叶雄次郎指出，在6月4日罢工中，普通火车乘客和罢工的铁道工人合作，“这说明对政府的行为的不满是现在在日本人民中广泛存在的情绪。这还说明，日本人民在过去几年中已经有了惊人的政治上的进步。”
    庆应大学教授池田洁道子在“东京新闻”上发表的谈话中说，这次罢工得到了人民的支持，因为它是反对岸信介内阁的罢工。她要求政界人士按照6月4日罢工所说明的问题来重新检查他们的态度。
