    For the Health of Women and Children on the Grasslands
    Jin Zhong, Women and Child Health Worker of Urad Front Banner, Bayannur League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    I am extremely excited and overjoyed to participate in the National Congress of Heroes. In the old society, I was the most miserable slave. My father died when I was twelve, and my mother couldn't support me and my sister, so she sold me to a tyrannical herd owner as a slave, where I suffered all kinds of humiliation and torment. After the liberation of the grasslands, the Party rescued me from the clutches of the tiger and cultivated me, a former illiterate, into a women and child health worker with a primary school education.

    In September 1952, the Party sent me to Hohhot to study new midwifery methods and women and child health care. Because I was illiterate at the time, I encountered many difficulties in my studies. Under the guidance and encouragement of the Party, I mustered up the courage and resolved to learn culture while learning technology. Often, I couldn't sleep all night to memorize the lectures. Fearing that I would affect my classmates' sleep, I used a flashlight in my quilt to memorize the words one by one. I studied like this for three months. At the beginning of 1953, I returned to Urad Front Banner and began to work on women and child health care in the pastoral areas. In 1958, I was transferred from the banner to Alaben Hashao People's Commune, which covers an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers and is inhabited by more than 3,000 people. In such a vast and sparsely populated grassland, it is impossible for a single women and child health worker to solve the diseases and suffering of all women and children. There must be more women and child health workers. When I raised this issue with the Party, I immediately received the Party's support and concern. First, I concentrated all my energy, and under the leadership of the Party, selected activists from the masses, and trained them through concentrated training and on-the-job apprenticeship, with on-site practice. Over the past seven years, I have trained more than 100 non-detached new midwifery personnel, more than 30 women and child health activists, and 5 nursery workers. Most of these midwives, in addition to learning injections and hemostasis, have also mastered general dystocia techniques. On this basis, with the support of the Party committee, we established the first maternity hospital in the production team, gradually expanding its influence, and later established a pastoral area central maternity hospital and a commune central kindergarten. All of this was done by everyone contributing ideas and relying on our own efforts. I took the lead in donating my white aluminum pot and thermos. In this way, by contributing people, materials, and money, we equipped it and now it has become a maternity hospital with 20 beds, housing an average of more than 10 maternity patients every day. 70% of the pregnant women in our commune deliver in the maternity hospital, and the remaining 30% are delivered by non-detached midwives.

    In January 1960, not long after the establishment of the commune central maternity hospital, a young pregnant woman came from 170 miles away. After examination, the pregnant woman had heart disease and the fetus was in breech position. Because the fetus had already entered the pelvis, it was too late to correct the fetal position. A few days later, on a dark night with strong winds, the time of delivery arrived. Sure enough, it was a difficult labor. One foot came out first. I used all the midwifery methods, but could not get the other foot out. If the fetus's head is not immediately separated from the mother's body, the fetus will soon suffocate and die, and the mother's life will also be in danger. However, the commune maternity hospital did not have surgical equipment. What should I do? Time passed second by second. Ten minutes passed. Massive bleeding and heart disease caused the pregnant woman to faint. At this time, I felt a little nervous and flustered, and I was about to have an accident, but I immediately remembered the teachings of the Party and said in my heart, "Be calm, don't panic." I calmed down and, based on past work experience, with meticulous and ingenious midwifery, the other foot finally came out. But the child's arms and head were still firmly stuck in the pelvis and could not be born. Half an hour passed, and both mother and child were at a critical juncture. I used the baby turning method to get the baby out of the mother's body. But the baby's mouth and nose were full of dirty blood and amniotic fluid, and it was suffocating and apparently dead. At this time, there was no suction device, and the situation was urgent. What should I do? For the sake of the child's life, I didn't care about anything, and I sucked the dirty blood and amniotic fluid out of the child's mouth, one mouthful at a time. After resuscitation, the child survived. The Party and the people gave me encouragement everywhere, cared for me all the time, and taught me. Only then could I deliver more than 200 babies in seven years, including 16 cases of various dystocias. These children are now very strong and lively.

    In 1952, I only studied women and child health knowledge of new midwifery methods for three months, and I didn't know how to treat any diseases at all. However, I encountered many sick people in my women and child health work. I am a Party member and a health worker. I cannot stand idly by and watch the folks get sick and not receive early treatment. If I want to truly relieve the pain of acute diseases in adults and children, it is far from enough to only know how to deliver babies. I must learn to treat diseases. Since I started working in 1953, I have been learning medical techniques while working. I asked medical personnel when I met them, and learned from people who knew a little medical knowledge. Every day, while eating, walking, and sleeping, I recited diagnostics, symptoms, drug names, and dosages. Now I can use more than 100 kinds of Western medicine and more than 10 kinds of Mongolian medicine, can diagnose general common diseases, and can treat more than 30 kinds of acute diseases.

    In January 1959,牧民萨色楞's most beloved son did not know what illness he had contracted. He had been twitching two or three times in a row, his eyes were tightly closed, and his condition was very dangerous. 萨色楞 and his wife were heartbroken and crying. This was forty miles away from my home, so I carried my medicine kit and ran to the patient's home in one breath. As soon as I entered the door, I saw the young mother standing blankly by the edge of the kang, staring desperately at her beloved child. When I picked up the child, I found that the child's limbs were cold, his breathing was weak, and there was only a little heat in his heart. Suddenly, the child convulsed again in my arms. A few minutes later, the child exhausted his last bit of strength and slumped down softly. After diagnosis, I knew it was acute pneumonia. Because the treatment was too late, the child's life was in danger. I injected penicillin and streptomycin one after another. The child had difficulty breathing. When various artificial respiration methods were ineffective, I used my mouth to help the child breathe, mouth to mouth. In this way, the child's breathing slowly increased, his body temperature rose, and I finally saved the child's life. This was the first time I treated a disease in an environment without a doctor.

    One day in February 1959, at noon, the sheep farm reported that thirteen children had malignant influenza, with high fever for five consecutive days, and four children had measles complicated with pneumonia. That noon, I rushed to the sheep farm. I was just about to inject针剂into何占贵's only child, who was already dying, when a woman who was neither here nor there sneered and walked away. 何占贵's wife wiped her tears and said:
  "We don't need you to treat the disease."何占贵 also stood up and said:
    "Can you cure the child? You will be responsible if you kill the child!" When I heard this, my nose soured and tears almost came out. But I was attracted by the child's serious illness. No matter how people distrusted me, I still seized every second to rescue the child. When I walked into张银虎's house,张银虎 was carrying his child outside. He glanced at me with desperate eyes and said sadly: "The child is possessed by an evil spirit and is already dying. I'm just waiting to throw him away." At this time, a force to save the child's life encouraged me. Without saying a word, I stepped forward and snatched the child back from张银虎's hands. The child's eyes were already closed, his hands and feet were slightly trembling, his long eyelashes, his dark short hair, and his round face were so lovely! I put my ear to the child's heart and listened carefully, and started giving the child an injection. When I walked to高四娃's door, the situation in front of me suddenly stunned me. It turned out that the woman who had just slipped away from何占贵's house was holding a "驱邪" dog skin whip, staring fiercely with both eyes, whipping the child who was less than four years old. It turned out that the witch was taking advantage of the villagers' eagerness to get rid of diseases to cheat people for money. While gently stroking the beaten scars on the sick child, I secretly made up my mind: "I must cure all the patients and break the superstition." The patients were distributed in three villages. I rushed around for two full days, regardless of everything, before treating all the patients once, but many patients had not yet improved.

    The next day,巴图陶格陶胡, the secretary of the commune party committee, came to comfort the patients. I reported the situation and asked 巴书记 to send some experienced doctors. 巴书记 said: "Leave these patients to you, you must cure them." Then he said: "We only have you as a women and child health worker in our commune. The Party and the folks completely believe that you can do it."巴书记's words gave me endless strength. After five days and five nights of hard work, seventeen lives were saved. In the past few years, I have rescued more than 50 critically ill patients.

    When I walk to every village, see the smiles of the mothers, and see many rosy little faces, I am full of energy and never feel tired. I feel that what I have done is far from enough, and I must work harder.

    I am a Mongolian woman and joined the Communist Party of China in 1959. Although I am already thirty-eight years old this year, I have only worked for the Party for seven or eight years. In the past few years, I have deeply felt that the Party is like my parents, nurturing me, cultivating me, educating me, liberating me from slavery, and now cultivating me from an illiterate to a people's health worker. I am determined to dedicate everything I have to the great cause of communism and to the cause of women and child health on the grasslands. Wherever the Party points, I will go there.

    为了草原上的妇幼健康
    内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟乌拉特前旗妇幼保健员　金钟
    我参加全国群英大会，万分激动，压不住内心高兴。我在旧社会里是个最痛苦的奴隶。十二岁上死去了父亲，母亲领我和妹妹活不下去，就把我卖给了恶霸牧主，当了奴隶，受尽了欺辱和折磨。草原解放，党把我从虎口里救了出来，并把我这个原来连一个字不识的文盲，培养成了具有高小文化程度的妇幼保健员。
    1952年9月间，党派我到呼和浩特学习新法接生和妇幼保健。因为我当时是文盲，学习上碰到不少困难。在党的教导和鼓舞下，我鼓足了勇气，下决心一面学文化，一面学技术，经常为了记讲的课程，通宿睡不着觉，又怕影响同学睡觉，在被窝里用手电筒照着一个字一个字地背下来。就这样学习了三个月。1953年初回到乌拉特前旗，开始做牧区的妇幼保健工作。1958年从旗里下放到阿力奔哈少人民公社，面积一千多平方公里，居住着三千余人。在那样地区广阔，居住分散的草原上，单靠一个妇幼保健员是解决不了整个妇女和儿童的疾病痛苦的，必须有更多的妇幼保健工作者。当我向党提出这个问题时，立即得到党的支持和关怀。我就首先集中全部精力，在党的领导下，从群众中挑选积极分子，用集中起来训练和实地带徒弟，当场实习的方法，七年来培训了不脱产的新法接生员一百多名，妇幼保健积极分子三十多名，还培养了五名保育员。他们中间大部分接生员除学会了注射和止血外，还掌握了一般难产技术。在这个基础上，由于党委的支持，我们在生产队成立了第一个产院，慢慢扩大影响，后又成立了牧区中心产院和公社中心幼儿园。这一切都是大伙献计献策自力更生办起来的，我带头把白铝锅和热水瓶献了出来。就这样你出人我出物他出钱的装备起来，目前已成为拥有二十个床位，每天平均住有十多名产妇的产院了。我们公社70％的孕妇在产院接生，其余30％的产妇则由不脱产接生员接生。
    1960年1月间，公社中心产院成立不久，从一百七十里外来了个青年孕妇，经过检查，产妇有心脏病，胎儿是臀位，因为胎儿已进入骨盆，要纠正胎位已经来不及了。没过几天，就在一个刮大风的黑夜，分娩的时候到了。果然是难产，先生出一只脚，我使用了所有的助产方法，都没有能使另一只脚生出来。如果不立刻使胎儿的头部脱离母体，胎儿很快会窒息而死，产妇的生命也很危险。可是，公社产院没有手术用具，怎么办？时间一秒一秒地度过，十分钟过去了。大量出血和心脏病使产妇昏了过去。这时我有些心跳发慌，眼看就要出事故，但立刻想起党的教导，在心里说，“要镇静，不要慌。”我定了定神，凭过去工作经验，经过细致而又巧妙的助产，另一只脚终于生出来了。可是孩子的双臂和头又牢牢卡在骨盆上，还是生不下来。半个小时过去了，母婴都到了生死关头。我使用了婴儿转身法，使婴儿脱出母体。但是婴儿口鼻堵满污血和羊水，窒息假死。这时又没有吸具，情况紧急，怎么办？为了孩子的生命，我什么都不管了，就嘴对孩子的嘴，一口一口地吸净污血羊水，经过抢救，孩子活了。党和人民处处给我鼓舞，时时关心我，教导我，才能这样的在七年中，接生了二百多个婴儿，其中有十六个是各种难产。这些小孩现在都很健壮活泼。
    我在1952年只学过三个月的新法接产的妇幼保健常识，根本不会治疗什么疾病。但在妇幼工作中遇到很多有病的人，我是个党员，是个卫生工作者，不能眼巴巴地看到老乡有了病，不能得到及早治疗。要想真正解除大人小孩急性疾病的痛苦，只会接生是非常不够的，必须学会治病。1953年工作以来，我就边工作边学医疗技术，碰到医疗人员就问，向懂一点医药常识的人学。每天吃饭、走道、睡觉都背诵诊断学、症状、药名和剂量等。现在我能应用一百多种西药和十几种蒙药，能诊断一般常见疾病，能治疗三十多种急性病症。
    1959年1月间，牧民萨色楞最疼爱的儿子不知害了什么病，已经连续抽搐两三次了，两眼紧闭，眼看病情十分危险了。萨色楞两口子伤心流泪。这是离我家四十里以外地方的事，我就背上药箱一口气跑到病人家去。一进门就看到年青的母亲垂着头呆呆地站在炕沿旁，绝望地看着心爱的孩子。当我抱起孩子时，发现孩子四肢冰冷，呼吸微弱，只有心口上还有点热气。突然孩子在怀里又痉挛起来。几分钟以后，孩子耗尽了他最后的一点力气，软瘫下去。经过诊断，知道是急性肺炎，因为治疗太晚了，孩子的生命有危险。青霉素链霉素一次接一次的注射，孩子呼吸困难，在使用各种人工呼吸无效时，即用嘴对着孩子的嘴帮助呼吸。这样孩子的呼吸慢慢增加，体温上升，总算把孩子救活了。这是我在没医生环境里第一次治病。
    1959年2月间一天中午，羊场传报出来，有十三个孩子患恶性流感，连续五天发高烧，有四个儿童患了麻疹合并肺炎。那天中午我就赶到羊场，正要给何占贵唯一的已经奄奄一息的孩子注射针剂，旁边有一个不三不四的女人冷笑一声走开了。何占贵的老婆拭着眼泪说：
  “我们不用你来治病。”何占贵也站起来说：
    “你能治好孩子吗？治死孩子你要负责！”我听到这儿，鼻子一酸，眼泪差一点流出来。但是我被孩子的严重病症吸引住了。不管人们怎样不信任，我还是抓紧每一秒时间抢救孩子。当我走进张银虎家中时，张银虎正抱着自己的孩子往外走，他用绝望的眼光把我打量了一下，悲伤地说：“孩子中了邪，已经不行啦，只等扔了。”这时要救活孩子的一股力量鼓舞着我，没讲二话跨上一步从张银虎手里夺回了孩子。孩子的眼睛已经闭上了，手脚稍微有点儿颤动，长长的睫毛，乌黑的短头发，圆圆的脸蛋子，多么惹人疼爱的孩子呀！我把耳朵贴到孩子心口上仔细听了听，开始给孩子打针。当我走进高四娃家门口时，眼前的情况，一下子叫我怔住了。原来刚刚从何占贵家溜掉的那个不三不四的女人正手拿“驱邪”的狗皮鞭，两眼狠狠地瞪着，鞭打着不满四周岁的小孩。原来是巫婆利用老乡急于摆脱疾病的时机，骗人赚钱。我一面轻轻抚摸着病孩被鞭打的伤痕，一面暗暗下了决心：“一定要治好全部病人，破除迷信。”病人分布在三个屯子里，我不顾一切整整跑了两天，才把所有的病人治疗了一遍，但许多病人还没有好转。
    第二天，公社党委书记巴图陶格陶胡同志来慰问病人，我把情况汇报了一下，并要求巴书记增派一些有经验的医生来。巴书记说：“这些病人交给你，一定要治好。”接着又说：“我们公社只有你一个妇幼保健员，党和老乡完全相信你能行。”巴书记的这几句话，给我增添了无穷的力量，经过五天五夜的苦战，十七条生命都得救了。几年来，经我手抢救好五十多个危重的病人。
    当我走到每个村屯，看到母亲们的笑容，看到许多绯红绯红的小脸的时候，就周身是劲，总不知疲倦。我感到自己做的还很不够，还要好好努力。
    我是一个蒙古族妇女，1959年加入了中国共产党。虽然我今年已经三十八岁了，但是为党才作了七、八年工作。几年来深深感到，党像父母一样，抚育我，培养我，教育我，把我从奴隶中解放出来，现在又把我从一个文盲培养成为人民的保健员，我决心把自己的一切都贡献给伟大的共产主义事业，贡献给草原上的妇幼保健事业，党指向哪里，我就到那儿去。
