Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th - "The Indian Express" published an editorial on the 6th regarding the new disarmament proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government, viciously slandering Soviet foreign policy. It falsely accused Khrushchev of making "diplomacy by means of threats" an integral part of his approach.

The newspaper reviled Khrushchev's disarmament proposals as "old Russian salad dressed with new salad oil."

This newspaper, which once excused the United States for sending U-2 spy planes to invade the Soviet Union and sabotage the Four-Power Summit, praised the so-called "supervision" used by the United States to undermine disarmament, saying, "Effective international observation and supervision are necessary conditions to ensure that all countries disarm in accordance with common agreements."

At the same time, this newspaper smeared Khrushchev for undermining disarmament, saying that he "has been doing his best to undermine" the so-called "international trust" on which disarmament depends "in recent weeks."

This Indian newspaper also brazenly attacked Khrushchev for exposing what it called "Eisenhower, the leader respected by the entire non-communist world, thereby further exacerbating the situation."

"The Hindustan Times" also attacked Khrushchev's recently proposed new disarmament proposals, saying that the proposal has "little new in it." The newspaper also attacked Khrushchev's condemnation of the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit as "highly unrestrained." It also slandered the Soviet Union's stern warning to strike at the bases from which American spy planes took off as a "threat," and said, "Doing so would have the opposite result."

    两家印报攻击苏联裁军建议
    诬蔑赫鲁晓夫的声明是“浇了新色拉油的老色拉”
    大捧艾森豪威尔并极力为美国侵略行为开脱罪责
    新华社新德里8日电　“印度快报”6日就苏联政府最近提出的裁军新建议发表社论，大肆诽谤苏联的外交政策。它诬蔑赫鲁晓夫已经使“威胁手段办外交”成为他的做法的不可分割的一部分。
    这家报纸谩骂赫鲁晓夫的裁军建议是“浇了俄国新色拉油的老色拉”。
    这家曾经为美国派遣U—2间谍飞机侵犯苏联、破坏四国首脑会议推卸罪责的报纸又吹捧美国借以破坏裁军的所谓“监督”，它说，“有效的国际观察和监督是确保一切国家按照共同协议进行裁军的必要条件”。
    同时这家报纸污蔑赫鲁晓夫破坏裁军，说他“在最近几星期来竭尽全力破坏”它所谓的赖以实现裁军的“国际信任”。
    这家印度报纸还放肆攻击赫鲁晓夫揭露了它所谓的“整个非共产党世界所尊敬的领袖——艾森豪威尔，从而进一步加剧了局势”。
    “印度斯坦时报”也攻击赫鲁晓夫最近提出的裁军新建议，说这个建议“新东西很少”。这家报纸还攻击赫鲁晓夫谴责美国破坏四国首脑会议是“高度的不自制”。它并且诽谤苏联要打击美国间谍飞机起飞基地的严正警告是一种“威胁”，而且说，“这样做会得到相反的结果”。
