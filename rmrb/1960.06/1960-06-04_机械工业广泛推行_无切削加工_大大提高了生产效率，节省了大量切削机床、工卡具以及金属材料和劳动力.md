(Reported by our newspaper) China's mechanical industry is vigorously promoting "non-cutting machining" methods, and some places have already launched a great upsurge in "non-cutting machining."

"Non-cutting machining" refers to directly manufacturing parts using methods such as precision casting, precision forging, precision rolling, and punching, pressing, extrusion, drawing, twisting, and stretching, without or with minimal cutting processes, to achieve the goal of producing mechanical equipment more quickly, better, and more economically. Currently, mechanical factories in Harbin have adopted "non-cutting machining" methods in the production of more than 200 products and more than 8,000 parts. Among them, more than 150 products, such as electric vehicles, ten-horsepower winches, fifty-horsepower winches, and oxygen generators, have achieved "non-cutting machining" for more than 90% of their parts. More than 20 factories in Shanghai, including the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, the Crane and Transportation Machinery Factory, and the Machine Tool Factory, have widely promoted "non-cutting machining." The national bearing manufacturing system has also quickly applied this advanced technology, and many bearing products have completely or largely achieved "non-cutting machining."

The experience of these places in promoting "non-cutting machining" proves that "non-cutting machining" can greatly improve labor productivity, save a lot of cutting machine tools, fixtures, and a large amount of metal materials and labor. For example, the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory eliminated all processes such as blanking, drilling, rough milling, and fitter filing in the processing of steam turbine partition blades, and switched to punching methods, which increased production efficiency by more than 2,000 times. The Shanghai Ball Bearing Factory adopted the method of precision hot-rolling bearing rings, which increased the material utilization rate from 40% to 75% to 80%, and the hot-rolled bearing rings have a tight metal structure, which can extend the service life of the bearing. The "swaged" drill bit made by the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory not only improves efficiency tenfold compared to cutting, but also increases the durability of the drill bit by 50%.

This advanced technology of "non-cutting machining" has been applied in the mechanical industry since 1958, but its promotion has been relatively slow due to the constraints of erroneous ideas such as "adopting advanced technology requires modern equipment" and "non-cutting machining can only be used for general products and not for precision products." In the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, these erroneous ideas were criticized, and the fact that many advanced enterprises and advanced regions achieved significant results by using indigenous methods to engage in "non-cutting machining" greatly encouraged the broad masses of workers in the mechanical industry, thereby enabling "non-cutting machining" to be rapidly promoted from pilot projects in a few enterprises to all parts of the country. With the deepening of the technical revolution movement, "non-cutting machining" is being further widely applied in more enterprises and more product production. (Attached picture)

    机械工业广泛推行“无切削加工”
    大大提高了生产效率，节省了大量切削机床、工卡具以及金属材料和劳动力
    本报讯　我国机械工业正在大力推广“无切削加工”的办法，有的地方已经掀起了大搞“无切削加工”的热潮。
    “无切削加工”，就是采用精铸、精锻、精轧和冲、压、挤、拔、扭、拉等方法直接制成零件，不经过或少经过切削加工的过程，达到多快好省地生产机械设备的目的。目前，哈尔滨市机械工厂已经在二百多种产品、八千多种零部件的生产中采用了“无切削加工”的办法，其中电瓶车、十马力卷扬机、五十马力卷扬机和制氧机等一百五十多种产品，已经有90％以上的零件实现了“无切削加工”。上海市柴油机厂、起重运输机厂、机床厂等二十多个工厂，都广泛推行了“无切削加工”。全国轴承制造系统也很快地运用了这种先进工艺，许多轴承产品，已经全部或大部实现了“无切削加工”。
    这些地方推行“无切削加工”的经验证明，“无切削加工”可以大大提高劳动生产率，节省很多切削机床、工卡具以及大量的金属材料和劳动力。例如，哈尔滨汽轮机厂在汽轮机隔叶片加工过程中，把下料、钻孔、粗铣、钳工锉修等工序全部取消，改用冲制办法，使生产效率提高了两千多倍。上海滚珠轴承厂采用了精密热轧轴承环的办法，使材料利用率由40％提高到75％至80％，而且热轧的轴承环金属组织紧密，能延长轴承的使用寿命。成都量具刃具厂制成的“搓制”钻头，不仅比切削加工可以提高效率十倍，而且钻头的耐用度还可以提高50％。
    “无切削加工”这种先进工艺，从1958年起已经开始在机械工业中应用，但由于受“采用先进工艺就得有现代化设备”、“无切削加工只能用于一般产品而不能用于精密产品”等错误思想的束缚，推广比较缓慢。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，这些错误思想受到了批判，许多先进企业和先进地区土法上马大搞“无切削加工”取得显著效果的事实，大大鼓舞了机械工业的广大职工，从而使“无切削加工”由少数企业试点迅速推广到全国各地。随着技术革命运动的深入发展，“无切削加工”正进一步在更多的企业和更多的产品生产中广泛应用。（附图片）
