    New Type of Socialist Enterprise Management System
    The Chinese Communist Party Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory Committee

    Editor's Note: The factory enterprise internal management system of "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" has seen some important developments in the past two years, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is one of the advanced models in this regard. The report written by the Party Committee of this factory systematically summarizes the experience in this area and looks forward to the future. It is a very good document. We are now publishing it for comrades in all factories and mines to study carefully. Factories and mines where conditions are already in place should promote the experience of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. Factories and mines where conditions are not yet in place should actively create conditions so that they can also promote it in the near future. There are two main conditions for promoting this experience: First, the leading cadres of the factory and mine have implemented the Party's mass line in their work, adhered to the system of cadres participating in labor, adhered to the work style of hard struggle, and thus won the complete trust of the vast majority of workers; second, the political consciousness of the majority of workers has been greatly improved, and they are truly able to treat state-owned enterprises with the attitude of masters, and implement the principle of putting the public first and the private second in all work. Because of these two conditions, a new relationship of "one heart, one mind, one look" can appear between leaders and those being led, promoting the rapid development of productive forces. In addition to the advanced model of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, there are many such advanced models in other provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. It is hoped that they can all be summarized and published in the central and provincial/municipal/autonomous region newspapers to promote further development of our factory and mine management system.

    Our factory is a newly built, modern large-scale enterprise mainly producing measuring and cutting tools. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past few years, we have deeply realized that believing in the Party and relying on the masses are the fundamental guarantees for running socialist enterprises well. As Chairman Mao said: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then nothing can be done." (On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation)

    From the beginning of its preparation, our factory has closely relied on the masses and adhered to the principle of building enterprises diligently and thriftily. It took only one year and ten months from preparation to completion, and it was put into full production in January 1958 ahead of schedule. Within six months of being put into production, it reached its original design capacity. In September 1959, it completed the various production targets assigned by the state's Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The profits turned over to the state in the past two years can be used to build two factories of the same scale as our factory. The current actual level of production has exceeded five times the design capacity. From January to April of this year, 62.3% of the annual plan was completed, which guarantees that the annual plan can be completed in half a year, realizing "one factory is worth six factories." According to the urgent needs of production, we have vigorously developed diversified operations and built new complex cutting tool branch factories, steel branch factories, and fourteen satellite factories for chemicals, grinding wheels, cement, etc. This has played a significant role in ensuring the continuous leap forward in production. At the same time, we have also vigorously supported the technical transformation of agriculture and the development of local industry.

    The above achievements were made under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, carrying out the struggle between the two lines, and constantly criticizing various right-leaning erroneous ideas. This is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of carrying out mass movements on a large scale.

    More, Faster, Better, and More Economical in Building Factories Diligently and Thriftily

    At the beginning of the factory construction in 1956, three questions were encountered: Should it be faster or slower? Should it be "launched" or "dismounted"? Should we focus on production first, then welfare, and build enterprises diligently and thriftily, or focus on welfare first, then production, and build enterprises with the airs of a young master? In the final analysis, this was a sharp struggle between more, faster, better, and more economical and less, slower, worse, and more expensive in terms of construction principles. Under the leadership of the Party at a higher level and with the vigorous support of various fraternal factories, we resolutely adopted the former and negated the latter. We abandoned the assertion of those who advocated "professional development" that measuring and cutting tool factories must be built separately. We reused the design of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and modified it according to actual conditions and the principle of economy, which allowed construction to take only eighty-three days. Regardless of the assertions of those who advocated "regular capital construction procedures," we adopted the principle of designing, constructing, and producing simultaneously. As soon as a factory building had water, we installed machines for production. Some workshops even organized trial production in other locations before the factory buildings were built. In this way, most of the workshops were put into production one after another in 1957, allowing workers to quickly become familiar with production technology, and they were fully put into production in January 1958. In the spring of 1957, under the circumstances of cutting capital construction investment, we further adopted the method of building the main production factory buildings first, followed by general buildings, concentrating 92.24% of the factory construction investment on productive construction. The office building was converted into a production workshop, and thatched huts were built as offices. Other living and welfare facilities such as children's schools, workers' spare-time schools, kindergartens, nurseries, canteens, and dormitories were also simply built as thatched huts. In this way, the investment in non-productive construction only accounted for 7.76%. This saved time, accelerated the progress of factory construction, expanded production capacity, and saved factory construction investment.

    The process of implementing the principle of building factories more, faster, better, and more economically and thriftily is a process of struggle between the two lines in politics and ideology. At that time, a small number of cadres had a skeptical attitude towards the principle of building factories more, faster, better, and more economically. These people mainly did not proceed from reality, adhered to conventions, and believed that this violated "regular capital construction procedures" and was "guerrilla习气" [guerrilla habits] and a "rural style." Bourgeois rightists took advantage of this confused thinking to attack the leadership of the Party, shouting that "capital construction was a miscalculation" and opposing our method of focusing on production first, then welfare, and putting production into operation in stages and batches, slandering that "building thatched huts is even more wasteful than building buildings." They even more frantically wanted the Party to withdraw from the enterprise and organize a "technical committee" to replace it. At this time, the main spearhead of the struggle must be directed at the bourgeois rightists. Only by carrying out the struggle between the two roads in politics and ideology can we further implement the principle of building factories more, faster, better, and more economically and thriftily. Through the rectification movement, the broad masses of workers and staff improved their socialist awareness, distinguished between right and wrong, educated those who doubted and wavered, solved the question of whether the Party could lead industry and whether non-professionals could lead professionals, affirmed the correct principle of building factories diligently and thriftily, and achieved a decisive victory in the struggle between the two roads in politics and ideology. From then on, the Party's General Line for socialist construction took root among the masses and cadres.

    Vigorously Develop Diversified Operations and Carry Out Technical Revolution on a Large Scale

    Since the Great Leap Forward, industrial and agricultural production throughout the country has developed rapidly, and the demand for measuring and cutting tools has increased unprecedentedly. In order to adapt to this new situation, we followed Chairman Mao's instruction that large-scale enterprises can gradually be developed into comprehensive joint enterprises, mobilized the masses to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, and used profit retention to vigorously develop diversified operations. A total of fourteen factory-wide satellite factories and one hundred and fifty-seven small group satellite factories have been established successively, gradually forming a comprehensive enterprise mainly producing measuring and cutting tools.

    The great call of the Party Central Committee to launch a mass steelmaking campaign gave us great encouragement. We started with small earthen furnaces for stir-frying steel and have now built a small steel joint enterprise including iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. Without refractory materials, we built a refractory materials workshop. Without carbon electrodes, we built an electrode workshop. As of the end of April this year, a total of 13,400 tons of steel, 3,140 tons of steel products, 7,540 tons of pig iron, and 1,640 tons of steel castings have been produced; and eight types of high-quality steel have been successfully trial-smelted.

    The insufficient supply of grinding tools such as grinding wheels, which are needed in large quantities for production in our factory, seriously affected production. The management staff of the tool library developed a communist style of daring to think and daring to act. Without any technical data or technical strength, they recruited some family members to set up a grinding wheel factory. Whatever is needed for production is manufactured, and whatever is lacking is supplemented. As of the end of April this year, 14 varieties, 156 specifications, and more than 1.8 million grinding wheels, as well as a large number of products such as sandpaper and abrasive cloth, have been produced, and the quality has reached national standards. The cost of grinding wheels is only half the state allocation price.

    There is a shortage of chemical materials such as potassium nitrate for heat treatment and quenching, so the supply section set up a small chemical factory. As of the end of April this year, 20 kinds of chemical raw materials have been produced, totaling 102 tons, which has solved part of the urgent needs of production.

    We also organized a capital construction engineering team of the factory by using a set of甲方 [Party A] organizations at the time of factory construction, which undertook all equipment installation tasks and finishing projects and dormitory projects at the time of factory construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the cooperation of relevant technical departments in the factory, they have completed more than 150,000 square meters of construction tasks. Now they can not only construct but also design, and can not only build small factory buildings but also factory buildings with more complex structures.

    The large-scale development of diversified operations has formed a widespread mass movement throughout the factory. Various branch factories, offices, workshops, and production groups have closely combined with needs and set up many satellite factories. The capital construction section used blast furnace slag to set up a cement factory. Without bricks and tiles, they set up a brick and tile factory. They also set up factories such as sawdust board using local materials. Various production groups also set up satellite factories using production intervals, some jointly by several groups, and some together with family members of employees. They made their own simple equipment, armed themselves, supported agriculture, and used waste products and old materials to make other products. In this way, whatever is lacking is done, whatever is needed is done, and whatever can be done is done, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees.

    This year, we actively responded to the Party's call to advance towards the "Four Modernizations" and quickly launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on the "Four Modernizations." The degree of mechanization of the entire factory has been greatly improved. As of the end of April this year, 42 new processes and technologies such as rubbing and twisting drills, powder metallurgy, and electrical discharge machining have been successfully tested and adopted; 27 automatic production lines and assembly lines, 184 single-machine automated and semi-automated machine tools, and one automated remote control workshop and one automated remote control section have been realized; 30 new precision products have been successfully trial-produced; and 387 major key production problems have been solved. With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations," new contradictions have emerged between the growth of production capacity and the supply of raw materials. Therefore, overcoming the difficulties of raw materials in every possible way has become a major direction of attack for the current technical innovation and technical revolution in our factory. In addition to proposing comprehensive leap forward targets of "one factory is worth six factories, quadrupling varieties, reducing staff by 20%, drawing 7 cadres, contracting 2 counties for agriculture, and helping 50 more factories," we particularly emphasized the action slogan of "smashing the materials barrier and doubling production." After repeated discussions by all the employees of the factory, a technical revolution plan and measures were formulated for three modernizations (mechanization, automation, and equipment specialization), three reforms (design, process, and equipment), three increases (increase precision, cutting-edge, and new products), thirteen grasps (smelting, rolling, drawing, pulling, rubbing, twisting, forging, welding, punching, heat, casting, substituting, saving), and one big (carrying out large-scale technical training). In this way, with a prominent center and clear direction, a new situation of mass movement focused on large-scale steelmaking to break through the materials barrier was formed again. Measuring and cutting tools, complex cutting tools, and electromechanical branch factories have all built small electric furnaces of 100 kg to 500 kg, using iron filings and waste materials to smelt steel, which has received remarkable results and can solve some of the difficulties in measuring and cutting tool production caused by insufficient steel.

    The diversified operations of our factory have developed in the continuous struggle between the two lines. In the two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, production has increased several times, and the demand for various raw materials has become greater and greater. Under these circumstances, should we be revolutionary self-reliant factions or stretching-hand factions of "sitting in sedan chairs and being carried by others"? Should we establish revolutionary ambitions and continuously leap forward in overcoming difficulties, or should we waver and shrink in front of difficulties and stagnate? In short, this is a struggle between more, faster, better, and more economical and less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Under the correct leadership and support of the Party committee at a higher level, we insisted on putting politics in command, mobilized the masses to drum up their enthusiasm, greatly increased their revolutionary spirit, and after carrying out a resolute struggle against all passive waiting thoughts and lazy coward views, we strengthened our determination to take the revolutionary road of self-reliance. And we have turned the difficulty of overcoming the shortage of raw materials into a positive factor to encourage the broad masses of employees to think of change when they are poor and make revolution, and turned it into a driving force to mobilize the masses to develop diversified operations on a large scale. After developing diversified operations on a large scale, the production of various raw materials has been developed; the comprehensive utilization of existing raw materials has been carried out, which has not only partially met the needs of our factory, but also supported the needs of fraternal factories. We have further achieved the goal of making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of things, promoting the continuous Great Leap Forward in production. In the large-scale development of diversified operations, some people believe that this is "not doing one's job properly" and "meddling in other people's business." We carried out a resolute struggle against this wrong view. The facts are just the opposite of this wrong view. The large-scale development of diversified operations is precisely to do the right thing for the General Line and to manage the right thing for the Great Leap Forward.

    Vigorously Support Agriculture and Establish an Overall Concept

    While vigorously developing diversified operations, we resolutely implemented the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. We vigorously supported agricultural production and agricultural technical transformation, and vigorously supported the development of local industry. We established an overall communist collaboration ideology among all employees.

    Vigorously supporting agriculture is a question of treating partial interests and overall interests, and current interests and long-term interests. We constantly strengthened the education of the worker-peasant alliance for the employees and regarded supporting agriculture as our glorious political task. In the past two years, we have successively helped Jintang County, Guan County, and the suburbs of Chengdu to establish eight factories such as machinery factories, fertilizer factories, and alcohol factories, and a small hydropower station. We have supported 510,000 tools, 61 kilometers of wires, 130 electric motors, and transformers in various special districts of the province. We have repaired and manufactured 160 sets of mechanical equipment and processed more than 5,000 parts and components. At the end of last year, we adopted the method of factory departments being responsible for communes, workshops being responsible for management areas (production brigades), and groups being responsible for production teams, with each level being responsible, targeted contracting, and the entire factory being mobilized. In just over a month, we helped the Qinglong Commune in the suburbs to establish three factories, eight repair and assembly stations, and one pumping station, and supported 200 sets (vehicles) of machinery and equipment and transportation tools. This year, adopting the same method, we have formulated a long-term plan to help Jianyang and Guan counties to establish county and commune machinery industry, carry out comprehensive transformation of agricultural technology, and help them actively develop the production of raw materials such as steel, iron, coal, and cement. When helping agricultural technical transformation and establishing raw material production bases, we basically adopted the principle of equivalent exchange, which prevented both the view of giving alms and the idea of dependence. Recently, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, we decided to draw some leading cadres and technical workers to work as backbones in the rural commune industry, so that the commune industry can lay a good foundation in both ideological leadership and production management from the beginning. At the same time, a part of farmers will be systematically transferred from rural areas to factories for training and support industrial production.

    It is our unshirkable responsibility to give full play to the backbone role of large-scale enterprises and help local industry develop production. In the past two years, we have adopted the methods of contracting construction, helping construction, large leading small, and delivering to the door to help 19 local factories grow rapidly. In 1958, we adopted the method of contracting to the end, from architectural design, process design to partial equipment manufacturing, installation, and production preparation, to help Chengdu Machine Tool Factory and Chengdu Bearing Factory to be built rapidly. In the past two years, we have transferred a total of 146 cadres to support five fraternal factories in complete sets. We helped various fraternal factories to manufacture 160 various machine tools. We helped the measuring and cutting tool factories in Wuhan and other cities to train more than 2,000 apprentices. We are now helping Shenyang and other places to design measuring and cutting tool factories. According to the spirit of large leading small and all people leading collectives, we have successively established comprehensive cooperative relations with more than 20 local factories and commune-run factories. We also organized advanced producers from the entire factory to frequently and actively go to various fraternal factories in the city to "pass on experience and give treasures" and exchange technical experience with each other.

    Supporting others also promotes one's own development. Through supporting industrial and agricultural activities, the communist style of the broad masses of employees has been cultivated, laying a good ideological foundation for the continuous leap forward of the enterprise. We often use the example of the rapid completion of our factory to educate employees to clearly recognize that this is inseparable from the vigorous support of many fraternal units. We must remember where the water comes from and not tear down the bridge after crossing the river. Now, the communist collaboration ideology and the idea of supporting industry and agriculture of all employees in the factory have been generally established, and the style of "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself" has been greatly promoted.

    Strengthen Group Work and Carry Out Mass Movements on a Large Scale

    The mass line is the Party's fundamental line, and of course it is also the fundamental line for running socialist enterprises well. The working class is the master of socialist enterprises and is the most active factor in production. Workers are both producers and managers of production. To run socialist enterprises well, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize workers to participate in the management of enterprises. In addition to holding regular workers' representative conferences, the most frequent and effective form is workers' participation in group management. And cadres' participation in labor is a prerequisite for workers' participation in management.

        First, Adhere to Cadres' Participation in Labor

    Each cadre's regular participation in labor every year, especially the frequent participation in labor by leading cadres, has extremely important significance for further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, improving leadership methods, overcoming bureaucracy, strengthening enterprise management, and promoting the continuous leap forward in production.

    In the past two years, the participation of cadres in labor in our factory has roughly taken the following forms. First, from factory-level cadres to workshop cadres, the leadership method of planting "experimental fields" has been generally promoted, and advanced experiences in various aspects have been summarized and promoted in a timely manner to help the backward quickly catch up with the advanced. Second, the system of following shifts for labor has been implemented throughout the factory. Cadres take workers as teachers and learn about and solve problems in ideology, production, and work in actual labor. Third, focusing on the key issues in current production, cadres take the lead in organizing technicians and workers to participate in surprise labor by adopting the method of "three combinations." Go wherever there are difficulties and solve them. Go wherever the weak links are and make a breakthrough. The participation in this kind of labor is the broadest, the number of people is the largest, the time is the most frequent, and the effect on promoting production is also the greatest.

    Through participating in labor, the relationship between cadres and workers has become closer, and cadres have also learned certain production skills. Now, the vast majority of cadres in the factory are able to operate one or several kinds of machines. Through their experience in production labor practice, cadres have further realized the creative ability and rich practical production knowledge of the working masses, realized the greatness of the collective wisdom of the masses, and therefore, they believe in the masses in everything, rely on the masses everywhere, and have learned to follow the mass line in their work, greatly reducing bureaucracy and winning the trust of workers. In the past, workers in the tool workshop criticized the planners, saying:

    Our workshop planners are busy from morning to night.
    But there is one thing, the planning is not thorough.
    If the machine tool stops, it doesn't matter, the workers are too bored.
    Wasting equipment and wasting electricity, time passes and will never return.
    We ask you to give us work, and ask the branch to take care of it.

    After the planner followed the shift for labor, he truly realized that the planning management was lagging behind the development of production, and together with the workers, he rearranged the production plan and helped the group solve the difficulties of insufficient supply of tools, fixtures, and raw materials. In this way, the workers saw that the cadres proceeded from the actual situation of production, consulted with the masses about things, and truly solved the problems, and they were very satisfied. They compared the relationship between cadres and the masses to: "In the past, it was like a pyramid, high above; now it is a satellite, revolving around the earth."

    Cadres have become close comrades-in-arms with workers through participating in production labor. They have established a deep feeling in the struggle to overcome difficulties, forming a strong force that can win every battle and overcome every difficulty. The original quota for a part in the micrometer group was 300 pieces, and some workers said it was too high. The cadres took the lead and did it themselves, with a daily output of 400 pieces. The workers were inspired and encouraged, and continued to study and improve, and the daily output soared to 600 and 700 pieces. The workers said:

    Cadres come to plant experimental fields, and everyone's enthusiasm breaks through the sky.
    From top to bottom, everyone is of one mind, and they are willing to work hard for ten years.

    Facts have proved that whether workers trust cadres and to what extent they trust them depends first on whether cadres believe in the masses and to what extent they believe in them. In the past, many cadres were too busy to do everything themselves, but they did not dare to hand over work to the masses, fearing that "decentralizing power would lead to chaos." In the past, the cadres in charge of finance thought, "Our eighty or ninety cadres can't do a good job of economic accounting, how can we hand it over to the workers to manage?" After participating in labor, they saw that the group's various economic management tasks were done quickly and well. For example, the management of work-in-progress was an old account that could not be settled for a long time in the past, but after group management, it was made clear and could be counted on the same day. The annual final accounts in the past could not be reported for two or three months, but this year it only took two or three days to report them. From these practices, everyone deeply realized that the working masses not only have rich production knowledge, but also have the ability to manage production; they can not only manage production, but also comprehensively manage ideology and life; they can not only manage, but also manage well. In this way, we have become more determined to mobilize the masses to participate in management, and we have boldly handed over the powers that should be decentralized and can be decentralized to the workers to manage. Those cadres who did not dare to let go in the past also said with emotion: "Relying on the masses, there are no old accounts that cannot be settled, and there are no dead accounts that cannot be revived."

    After the workers participated in management, they shared most of the cadres' daily management work, which created better conditions for the cadres to participate in labor and favorable conditions for the cadres to go deep into reality and better lead production. And the cadres, while participating in labor, helped the group establish various systems and methods for managing production, truly combining professional management and mass management, and further promoted the improvement of the group's management level. In the past, some cadres believed that "decentralizing power would leave nothing to do and lose their jobs"; now they believe that "not going deep into the masses and not going to production to lead production is the real unemployment." Participating in labor promoted the ideological transformation of cadres and technicians, and they learned to follow the mass line. They said happily: "This is the real abandonment of the employment-oriented professional ideology and the establishment of the communist career ideology."

    Without cadres participating in labor, there can be no workers participating in management. Cadres' participation in labor promotes workers' participation in management; and workers' participation in management creates conditions for cadres to participate in labor, prompting cadres to go deeper into production to lead production. This mutually reinforcing process is the process of production relations continuously adapting to the development of productive forces and promoting the continuous leap forward in production. In the process of continuous leap forward in production, it is required to more widely concentrate the wisdom of the masses to solve new contradictions in production. This repeatedly developing process is also the process of fully playing the role of "three combinations" of leading cadres, technicians, and workers.

    Second, Fully Mobilize Workers to Participate in Enterprise Management

    The practice of mass movements on a large scale in our factory in the past two years has proved that there are many forms of workers' participation in management, and participation in group management is the most effective and most basic form at present. The production group is both the starting point for launching mass movements on a large scale and the foothold for doing various tasks in a down-to-earth manner. And the key to strengthening group management lies in whether the Party's mass line is resolutely implemented and whether all the powers that the group should manage and can manage are boldly and thoroughly decentralized to the group. This is a revolution in enterprise management, a main sign to measure whether the enterprise's leading cadres implement the mass line, and also the focus of the struggle between two ideas in enterprise management in the past two years: relying on a small number of people to manage well, or relying on the masses to participate in management and manage well.

    The process of strengthening group management and decentralizing power in our factory is a process of continuously implementing the "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations" and the hierarchical and decentralized management system. At the beginning, workers participated in daily production management, and gradually developed into a mass movement of group economic accounting, participating in economic management, and then developed into participating in technical management, until participating in comprehensive enterprise management. In this way, the content of group management is richer, and professional management has a broad mass base. Combining professional management and mass management, further implementing the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership and mass movements on a large scale, constantly adjusting the contradictions between productive forces and production relations, and promoting the continuous leap forward in production.

    Through the great rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the sense of responsibility as masters of the working masses has been greatly strengthened. Therefore, the requirements for participating in enterprise management and reforming unreasonable rules and regulations are becoming more and more urgent. In the Double Anti movement, about 80% of the more than 100,000 big-character posters posted by the masses of workers and staff were aimed at the contradiction that management work was lagging behind the development of production. One big-character poster wrote:

    Go to work early in the morning, there are a lot of tasks.
    Borrow tools and drawings, running around takes time.
    Quarreling here and there, talking more and doing less.
    Everything has to be done by cadres, how can the masters be good.

    We resolutely supported this reasonable demand of the masses, mobilized the masses to break old rules, resolutely and boldly decentralized power, reformed the system, implemented cadres' participation in labor, established the organization and system of group management by eight people, implemented "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations," adjusted the internal relations of the enterprise, adapted to the requirements of the development of productive forces, and the entire factory took on a new look. The workers praised this reform, saying:

    Decentralizing power makes me feel happy, we arrange production ourselves.
    Tools and drawings are prepared early, heroes have martial arts to use.
    Without three or five years, the old British and American brands will be left behind.

    The Party's mass line has further taken root among the cadres in our factory, and the production groups have gradually grown up. Practice has proved that the more the leaders believe in the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, and the more they can give play to infinite wisdom and strength. With the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of the working masses and the continuous leap forward in production, in early 1959, the workers urgently demanded that power continue to be decentralized to further participate in the economic management of the enterprise. They said: "If you don't manage money when you are the master of the house, how can you be a good master?" However, some people with right-leaning ideas said: In the past, "decentralizing power caused chaos" and "the old rules and regulations were excessively uglified." They doubted and negated the achievements of the mass movement on a large scale and attempted to go backwards. We mobilized the masses to resolutely criticize this wrong thinking, adhered to the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership and carrying out mass movements on a large scale, resolutely implemented the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee on the hierarchical and decentralized management system, actively supported the demands of the masses, and decentralized financial power at all levels. In May, a mass movement of economic accounting based on group accounting was launched throughout the factory, reversing the cold and deserted situation of a small number of people doing cost accounting in the past. The idea of running enterprises diligently and thriftily was further established, the atmosphere of thrift was greatly promoted, and a new atmosphere of everyone accounting and everyone managing money emerged. After the group managed the money, the workers were very active and serious about the economic accounting work, and they did it quickly and well. They took the initiative to propose advanced indicators and measures, established easy-to-understand and practical original records, personal statistical manuals, and account cards and charts for the management of the eight people, and established and improved a complete set of group management systems such as grasping planning and preparation before the shift; grasping inspection during the shift; grasping analysis and evaluation after the shift, which promoted the entire enterprise management work to take a big step forward. After the group accounting was carried out, it greatly promoted the development of technical revolution, and the development of technical revolution promoted economic accounting. In 1959, the cost target of the entire factory was set at a reduction of 7% at the beginning of the year, but it actually reduced by 26.8%.

    Group economic accounting should be combined with the conscious labor competition of the working class and appropriate material rewards. According to the provisions of comprehensive rewards, combined with the specific situation of our factory, we have formulated and implemented the "Reward Method for Excellent Groups." Under the premise that the group completes the three major indicators of output value, quality, and cost every month, and there are no major accidents, exceeding the production task will be calculated and awarded bonuses according to different exceeding numbers. Those who catch up with the production progress by the 10th of each month are first class, those who catch up with the progress by the 20th are second class, and those who catch up with the progress after the 20th are third class. In order to prepare for production work in advance, the group takes the initiative to urge the workshop for the planning indicators, drawings, cards, materials, and tools for the next month around the 20th of each month. This has played a positive role in breaking the routine of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month. The specific method of reward is: only if the group wins the award, can individuals be rewarded; the individual bonus is divided into three levels according to each person's performance in completing the group's task, and those who are not good are not rewarded. The reward method is closely combined with the labor competition, and large-scale evaluations and comparisons are conducted regularly. At the same time as issuing red flags and certificates, bonuses are issued. This method is very popular among the masses, embodies the spirit of adhering to putting politics in command and combining it with appropriate material rewards, and avoids certain economistic tendencies that were prone to occur when the piece-rate wage system was implemented in the past, which hindered the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Group economic accounting, labor competition, and appropriate rewards form a complete set of regular group management systems. This promotes each other, promotes the development of the movement, promotes the technical revolution and the improvement of the management level, and guarantees the continuous Great Leap Forward in production.

    Under these circumstances, some of the original technical management systems have been unable to adapt to the requirements of production development, and even restrict the production enthusiasm of the masses. The workers' requirements for participating in technical management, especially participating in process management, are becoming more and more urgent. We have also decentralized the powers of process preparation and product design to the group.

    Process is a summary of the practical experience of workers. The more the masses create, the more advanced and perfect the content of the process will be. In the past, some technicians mystified the process and regarded it as an unchangeable and sacred law. The workers criticized this view as "there are dashed lines and solid lines on the drawings, but there is no mass line." Through the anti-rightist struggle, the technicians improved their ideological awareness, strengthened their mass viewpoint, gradually approached the workers in terms of thoughts and feelings, and took the initiative to decentralize the process and asked to settle down in the group. We supported this positive suggestion. After decentralizing the process to the group, the workers' ability to be masters of their own affairs was further brought into play. For example, after the automatic lathe group of the measuring tool branch factory prepared its own process cards, it designed and manufactured the cams that were difficult to design and manufacture in the past, and the production efficiency was several times higher than before the decentralization, and the product quality was also significantly improved. The technicians said: "Going to the masses will give you a way."

    Technicians and workers combined to summarize the experience of advanced pacesetters, greatly simplified the process documents, and creatively compiled them into vivid and lively forms such as poems and rhymes, so that the masses could easily learn and understand and easily promote them. The continuous emergence and promotion of advanced operation methods have kept the process regulations at the most advanced level. This ensures the continuous improvement of product quantity and quality.

    The simplification of the process and the workers' own design and preparation of the process have freed the technicians from the circle of affairs and given them more time to frequently go deep into the group, participate in discussions and approve the new processes prepared by the workers, and jointly study and solve technical problems with the workers, summarize and promote various advanced experiences that have been successfully tested by the group. In this way, there is not only "release," but also strengthened "management." Therefore, the idea that decentralizing power will cause management chaos is not realistic.

    After the group implemented comprehensive management of planning, finance, and technology, it paid special attention to political and ideological work while strengthening leadership over production. The core leading members of many groups played an exemplary role everywhere, truly achieving the goals of going up when

    新型的社会主义企业管理制度
    中共成都量具刃具厂委员会
    编者按：工厂企业内部“两参一改三结合”的管理制度，近两年来有了一些重要的发展，这是一种十分可喜的现象。成都量具刃具厂就是这方面的先进典型之一。这个厂的党委会所写的这个报告，系统地总结了这方面的经验，并且展望了将来的前途，是一个很好的文件。现特加以发表，望各厂矿企业的同志们细心地加以研究。凡是条件业已具备的厂矿企业，应当推广成都量具刃具厂的经验，条件尚未具备的厂矿企业，则应积极创造条件，以便在不久以后也能推广。推广这项经验的主要条件有两个：一是厂矿企业的领导干部在工作中贯彻执行了党的群众路线，坚持干部参加劳动的制度，坚持艰苦奋斗的工作作风，因而取得绝大多数工人的完全信任；二是大多数工人的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，真正能够以主人翁的态度对待国营企业，在一切工作中贯彻执行了先公后私的原则。由于有了这两个条件，所以在领导者和被领导者之间就能够出现“一条心，一股劲，一个样”的新的相互关系，促进生产力的迅速发展。除开成都量具刃具厂的先进典型之外，在其他各省、市、自治区还有不少这类先进典型，希望都能加以总结，并且在中央和各省、市、自治区的报纸上发表，以便推动我们的厂矿企业的管理制度能有普遍的进一步的发展。
    我厂是一个新建不久的以生产量具刃具为主的现代化大型企业。在几年来的连续大跃进中，我们深深地体会到，相信党，依靠群众，是办好社会主义企业的根本保证。正如毛主席所说的：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”（关于农业合作化问题）
    我厂从筹建开始，就紧密依靠群众，坚持了勤俭办企业的方针。从筹建到建成仅用了一年零十个月的时间，提前在1958年1月全面投入生产。在投入生产后半年之内，就达到了原来的设计能力。1959年9月提前完成国家下达的第二个五年计划的各项生产指标。两年来完成的上缴利润，可以再建两个与我厂同样规模的工厂。目前的生产实际水平，已经超过设计能力的五倍以上。今年1至4月完成了全年计划的62．3％，这样，就可以保证在半年内完成全年计划，实现“一厂顶六厂”。我们根据生产的迫切需要，大办多种经营，新建了复杂刃具分厂、钢铁分厂和化工、砂轮、水泥等十四个卫星厂。这对于保证生产的持续跃进起了重大作用。同时，我们还大力支援了农业技术改造和地方工业的发展。
    上述成就的取得，是在省委和市委的直接领导下，坚持政治挂帅，开展两条路线的斗争，不断批判各种右倾错误思想的结果。这是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，大搞群众运动的胜利。多快好省　勤俭办厂
    1956年建厂一开始，就遇到了三个问题：是快一点还是慢一点？是“上马”还是“下马”？是先生产、后福利，勤俭办企业，还是先福利、后生产，以大少爷的派头办企业？归根到底，这是多快好省同少慢差费在建设方针上的一场尖锐斗争。我们在上级党的领导下，在各兄弟厂的大力支援下，坚决采取了前者，否定了后者。我们抛弃了“专业发展论”者一定要把量具刃具分开建厂的主张，重复使用了哈尔滨量具刃具厂的设计，根据实际情况和节约原则加以修改，使筹建时间仅仅用了八十三天。我们不顾那些“基建正规程序论”者的主张，采取边设计、边施工、边生产的方针，只要厂房一断水，就安装机器生产，甚至有的车间在厂房还没有盖起来的时候，就利用其他场地组织试生产。这样，在1957年内，大部分车间陆续投入了生产，使工人很快熟悉了生产技术，到1958年1月就全面投入了生产。在1957年春削减基建投资的情况下，我们进一步采取了先建主要生产厂房，后建一般性建筑的办法，把92．24％的建厂投资集中使用在生产性的建设上。把办公大楼改作了生产车间，另盖草房作了办公室。其他生活福利设施如子弟学校、职工业余学校、幼儿园、托儿所、食堂、宿舍等，也都是因陋就简修盖草房。这样，用在非生产性建设上的投资，只占7．76％。这就赢得了时间，加快了建厂进度，扩大了生产能力，节约了建厂投资。
    贯彻执行多快好省勤俭建厂方针的过程，是一个政治上、思想上两条路线斗争的过程。当时，少数干部对于多快好省的建厂方针，抱着怀疑的态度。这些人主要是不从实际出发，墨守成规，认为这是违反“基建正规程序”，是“游击习气”、“农村作风”。资产阶级的右派分子利用这种混乱思想，乘机攻击党的领导，大叫
  “基建失策”，反对我们先生产后福利、分期分批投入生产的办法，诬蔑“盖草房比盖楼房还要浪费”。他们更猖狂地要党退出企业，另组织“技术委员会”取而代之。这时候斗争的主要矛头必须指向资产阶级右派，只有开展政治上、思想上两条道路的斗争，才能进一步贯彻多快好省的勤俭建厂方针。通过整风运动，广大职工群众提高了社会主义觉悟，划清了大是大非，教育了怀疑动摇的人，解决了党能不能领导工业、外行能不能领导内行的问题，肯定了勤俭建厂的正确方针，取得了政治上思想上两条道路斗争的决定性的胜利。从此，党的社会主义建设总路线在群众和干部中生了根。大办多种经营　大闹技术革命
    大跃进以来，全国工农业生产飞跃发展，对于量具刃具的需要空前增长。为了适应这种新的情况，我们遵循毛主席关于大型企业可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业的指示，发动群众大闹技术革命，利用利润留成，大办多种经营。先后共举办了全厂性的卫星厂十四个，小组卫星厂一百五十七个，逐步形成一个以生产量具刃具为主的综合性企业。
    党中央提出全民大办钢铁的伟大号召，给了我们极大的鼓舞。我们从小土炉炒钢开始，到现在已建成一个包括炼铁、炼钢、轧钢的小型钢铁联合企业。没有耐火材料，就建了耐火材料车间。没有炭精棒，就建了电极车间。到今年4月底止，共生产了钢一万三千四百吨，钢材三千一百四十吨，生铁七千五百四十吨，浇钢件一千六百四十吨；并且试炼成功八种优质钢材。
    我厂生产上需要的大量砂轮等磨料工具供应不足，严重地影响到生产。工具库的管理人员发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，在一无技术资料二无技术力量的情况下，吸收一些家属办起了一个砂轮厂。生产上需要什么，就制造什么，缺什么就补什么。到今年4月底止，已经生产了十四个品种、一百五十六个规格、一百八十多万件砂轮，以及大量的砂纸、砂布等产品，质量达到了国家标准。砂轮的成本仅为国家调拨价格的一半。
    热处理淬火用的硝酸钾等化工材料缺乏，供应科就办起了一个小化工厂。到今年4月底，生产了二十种化工原料，共计一百零二吨，解决了生产上的部分急需。
    我们还把建厂时的一套甲方组织机构，组成工厂的基建工程队，在建厂时担负了全部设备安装任务和收尾工程、宿舍工程。大跃进以来，在厂内有关技术部门的配合下，完成了十五万多平方米的建设任务。现在他们不仅能施工，而且能设计，不仅能建筑小型厂房，而且能建筑结构比较复杂的厂房。
    大办多种经营，在全厂范围内形成了一个广泛的群众运动。各个分厂、办公室、车间、生产小组，都紧密结合需要，办起了许多卫星厂。基建科利用高炉矿渣办起了水泥厂。没有砖瓦，就办了砖瓦厂。又就地取材办起了锯末板等厂。各生产小组利用生产间隙时间，也办起了卫星厂，有的是几个小组合办，有的是和职工家属一起办。他们自制简易设备，武装自己，支援农业，利用废品和废旧料做其他产品。这样缺啥干啥，要啥干啥，能干啥就干啥，充分发挥了职工群众的积极性和创造性。
    今年我们积极响应了党提出的向“四化”进军的号召，迅速开展了以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命的群众运动。全厂机械化程度大大提高。到今年4月底止，试验成功并采用了搓制、扭制钻头、粉末冶金、电火花加工等新工艺、新技术四十二项；实现了自动生产线、流水线二十七条，单机自动化和半自动化机床一百八十四台，以及自动化遥控车间和工段各一个；试制成功了精密的新产品三十种；解决了生产上的重大关键三百八十七项。随着以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动的开展，生产能力的增长和原材料供应之间出现了新的矛盾。因此，千方百计战胜原材料困难，就成为我厂当前技术革新、技术革命的一个主攻方向。我们除了提出“一厂顶六厂，品种增四倍，人员减二成，干部抽七套，农业包两县，再帮五十厂”的全面跃进指标外，特别强调提出了“大破材料关，生产翻一番”的行动口号。经过全厂职工反复讨论，制定了三化（机械化、自动化、设备专用化）、三改（改设计、工艺、设备）、三增（增加精密、尖端、新产品）、十三抓（炼、轧、拉、拔、搓、扭、锻、焊、冲、热、铸、代、节）和一大（大搞技术培训）的技术革命规划和措施。这样，中心突出，方向明确，又一次形成了以大办钢铁为中心的突破材料关的群众运动新局面。量具刃具、复杂刃具和机电等分厂，都建起了一百公斤至五百公斤的小电炉，利用铁屑废料炼钢，收到了显著的效果，已能自己解决因钢材不足而影响量具刃具生产的部分困难。
    我厂的多种经营，是在不断进行两条路线的斗争中发展起来的。在两年的持续大跃进中，生产成倍地增长，对各种原材料的需要量越来越大。在这种情况下，是当自力更生的革命派，还是当“自己坐轿别人抬”的伸手派？是树立革命的雄心壮志在战胜困难中不断跃进，还是在困难面前动摇畏缩停滞不前？总之，这是一个多快好省同少慢差费的斗争。我们在上级党委的正确领导和支持下，坚持政治挂帅，发动群众大鼓干劲，大长革命志气，在同一切消极等待思想和懒汉懦夫观点进行了坚决的斗争以后，坚定了走自力更生的革命道路。并且把克服原材料供应不足的困难，变成为激励广大职工穷则思变，大闹革命的积极因素，变成为发动群众大办多种经营的动力。大办多种经营以后，发展了多种原材料的生产；进行了现有原材料的综合利用，不仅部分地满足了本厂的需要，而且也支援了兄弟工厂的需要。进一步做到了人尽其才，物尽其用，促进了生产持续大跃进。在大办多种经营中，有人认为这是“不务正业”“多管闲事”。我们同这种错误观点进行了坚决的斗争。事实同这种错误观点恰恰相反，大办多种经营，正是务了总路线的正业，管了大跃进的正事。
    大力支援农业　树立整体观念
    我们在大办多种经营的同时，坚决贯彻执行了国民经济以农业为基础，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。大力支援了农业生产和农业技术改造，大力支援了地方工业的发展。在全体职工中，树立了共产主义大协作的整体思想。
    大力支援农业，是一个对待局部利益和整体利益、目前利益和长远利益的问题。我们不断地对职工群众加强工农联盟的教育，把支援农业作为自己光荣的政治任务。两年来，我们先后帮助金堂县、灌县和成都市郊区，建立了机械厂、肥料厂、酒精厂等八个工厂和一个小型水电站，支援了全省各专区五十一万件工具、六十一公里电线、一百三十台电动机和变压器，修理和制造了一百六十台机械设备，加工了五千多个零件、部件。去年年底，我们采取了厂部对公社、车间对管理区（生产大队）、小组对生产队，层层负责、对口包干、全厂动手的办法，仅在一个多月的时间内，帮助郊区青龙公社建立了三个工厂，八个修配站，一个抽水站，支援了二百台（辆）机器设备和运输工具。今年采取同样的办法，制定了长远的规划，帮助简阳、灌县两个县，建立县、社机械工业，进行农业技术的全面改造，帮助他们积极发展钢、铁、煤、水泥等原材料的生产。在帮助农业技术改造和建立原材料生产基地时，我们基本上采取了等价交换的原则，既防止了恩赐观点，也避免了依赖思想。最近，我们根据市委的指示，决定抽出部分领导干部和技术工人，到农村公社工业中作骨干，使公社工业一开始就在思想领导和生产管理两个方面，打下良好的基础。同时，由农村有计划地抽调一部分农民来厂培训和支援工业生产。
    充分发挥大洋企业的骨干作用，帮助地方工业发展生产，是我们义不容辞的责任。两年来，我们采取了包建、帮建、大带小和送上门的办法，帮助了十九个地方工厂迅速成长。1958年我们采取包干到底的办法，从建筑设计、工艺设计到部分设备制造、安装和生产准备，帮助成都机床厂、成都轴承厂迅速建成。两年来，我们共抽调了一百四十六名干部，成套地支援了五个兄弟工厂。帮助各兄弟工厂制造了各类机床一百六十台。帮助武汉等市的量具刃具厂培训了二千多名学工。现在正帮助沈阳等地设计量具刃具厂。根据大带小、全民带集体的精神，先后同二十几个地方工厂和社办工厂，建立了全面的协作关系。我们还组织全厂的先进生产者，经常主动地到市内各兄弟工厂“传经送宝”，互相交流技术经验。
    支援了别人，也就促进了自己的发展。通过支援工农业的活动，培养了广大职工的共产主义风格，为本企业的持续跃进奠定了良好的思想基础。我们经常以本厂迅速建成的事例，教育职工明确认识，这是和许许多多兄弟单位的大力支援分不开的，我们要饮水思源，不能过河拆桥。现在，全厂职工的共产主义大协作思想，支援工农业的思想，已经普遍地树立起来，“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”的风格，得到大大发扬。加强小组工作　大搞群众运动
    群众路线是党的根本路线，当然也是办好社会主义企业的根本路线。工人阶级是社会主义企业的主人，是生产中最活跃的因素。工人既是生产者，也是生产的管理者。要办好社会主义企业，必须相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动工人参加企业的管理。除了定期召开职工代表大会外，最经常、最有效的形式是工人参加小组管理。而干部参加劳动，又是工人参加管理的前提。
        一、坚持干部参加劳动
    每个干部每年定期参加劳动，特别是领导干部经常参加劳动，对于进一步密切干部同群众的关系，改进领导方法，克服官僚主义，加强企业管理，推动生产的持续跃进，都具有极其重大的意义。
    两年来，我厂干部参加劳动大约有以下几种形式。第一、从厂一级干部到车间干部，普遍推行了种“试验田”的领导方法，及时总结和推广各方面的先进经验，帮助落后的迅速赶上先进的。第二、在全厂范围内，实行了跟班劳动的制度。干部拜工人为师，在实际劳动中，了解和解决思想、生产和工作中的问题。第三、围绕当前生产中的关键问题，由干部带头，组织技术人员和工人，采取三结合的办法，参加突击性的劳动。哪里有困难就到哪里解决。哪里是薄弱环节就到哪里突击。参加这种劳动的面最广，人数最多，时间最经常，对于推动生产的作用也最大。
    通过参加劳动，更加密切了干部和工人的关系，也使干部学会了一定的生产技能。现在，全厂绝大多数干部都能够操纵一种或数种机器。干部通过在生产劳动实践中的体验，进一步认识到工人群众的创造能力和丰富的生产实际知识，认识到群众集体智慧的伟大，因此，事事相信群众，处处依靠群众，学会了在工作中走群众路线，大大减少了官僚主义，赢得了工人的信任。工具车间的工人过去批评计划员说：
    我们车间计划员，从早到晚不得闲。
    就是有一点，计划不周全。
    机床停了还不算，工人闲得太心烦。
    浪费设备浪费电，时间过去不再还。
    我们向你要活干，要求支部管一管。计划员跟班劳动以后，真正认识到了计划管理落后于生产发展的情况，同工人一道重新安排生产计划，帮助小组解决了工卡具、原材料等供应不足的困难。这样，工人看到干部从生产实际出发，有事和群众商量，真正解决了问题，非常满意。他们把干部和群众的关系比作是：“过去像金字塔，高高在上；现在是卫星，围绕着地球转。”
    干部通过参加生产劳动和工人结成了亲密的战友，在克服困难的斗争中，建立了深厚的感情，形成战无不胜，攻无不克的坚强力量。量具千分尺小组原先有个部件定额是三百件，有的工人说太高了。干部以身作则，亲自动手，日产量达到四百件，工人受到启发鼓舞，继续钻研改进，日产量又猛升到六百、七百件。工人们说：
    干部来种试验田，大伙干劲冲破天。
    上上下下一条心，苦战十年也心甘。
    事实证明，工人信不信任干部和信任到什么程度，首先决定于干部是不是相信群众和相信到什么程度。过去有不少干部自己忙不过来，但是又不敢把工作交给群众去做，怕“下放权力出乱子”。过去管财务的干部认为“我们八、九十个干部都搞不好经济核算工作，交给工人怎么能够管得好呢？”参加劳动后，他们看到小组的各项经济管理，做得又快又好。例如对于在制品的管理，过去很长时间是一笔算不清的老账，而小组管理以后，弄得一清二楚，当天就能统计起来。过去的年度决算，两三个月都报不出去，今年只用两三天就报出去了。从这些实践中，大家深深地体会到，工人群众不仅有丰富的生产知识，而且有管理生产的才能；不仅能够管理生产，而且能够全面管理思想、生活；不仅能管，而且能管得好。这样，我们就更加坚定了发动群众参加管理的决心，放手地把当前应该下放和能够下放的权力交给工人去管。原来不敢放手的那些干部也感动地说：“依靠了群众，就没有算不清的老账，没有算不活的死账。”
    工人参加管理以后，分担了干部大部分日常的管理工作，这就为干部参加劳动创造了更好的条件，也为干部深入实际，更好地领导生产创造了有利条件。而干部在参加劳动中，帮助小组建立起各种管理生产的制度和办法，真正作到专业管理和群众管理相结合，促使小组管理水平进一步提高。过去有的干部认为“下放权力就无事可作，失了业”；现在则认为“不深入群众，不到生产中去领导生产，才是真正的失业。”参加劳动促进了干部和技术人员的思想改造，学会了走群众路线。他们高兴地说：“这才真正丢掉了雇佣观点的职业思想，树立了共产主义的事业思想。”
    没有干部参加劳动，就不可能有工人参加管理。干部参加劳动，促进了工人参加管理；而工人参加管理又为干部参加劳动创造了条件，促使干部更加深入生产领导生产。这种互相促进的过程，是生产关系不断适应生产力的发展，推动生产持续跃进的过程。在生产不断跃进的过程中，要求更加广泛地集中群众的智慧，解决生产中出现的新的矛盾。这个反复发展的过程，也是充分发挥领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合作用的过程。
    二、充分发动工人参加企业管理
    从我厂两年来大搞群众运动的实践证明：工人参加管理的形式很多，而参加小组管理则是当前最有效和最基本的形式。生产小组既是轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动的起点，又是扎扎实实作好各项工作的落脚点。而加强小组管理的关键，在于是否坚决贯彻了党的群众路线，敢不敢把小组应该管而且能够管的一切权力，大胆地彻底地下放到小组。这是企业管理的革命，是衡量企业领导干部是否贯彻群众路线的主要标志，也是两年来在企业管理上依靠少数人管理好，还是依靠群众参加管理好的两种思想斗争的焦点。
    我厂加强小组管理、下放权力的过程，是不断贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”和分级分权管理制度的过程。开始是由工人参加日常的生产管理，逐步发展到大搞小组经济核算，参加经济管理，进而发展到参加技术管理，直至参加全面的企业管理。这样，小组管理的内容就更加丰富，专业管理也就有了广泛的群众基础。把专业管理和群众管理结合起来，进一步贯彻了党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，不断地调整了生产力和生产关系的矛盾，促进了生产的持续跃进。
    经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，职工群众的主人翁责任感大大加强，因此，对于参加企业管理和改革不合理的规章制度的要求越来越强烈。在双反运动中，职工群众贴出的十多万张大字报，有80％左右是针对着管理工作落后于生产发展的矛盾提出的。有一张大字报这样写道：
    清早来上班，任务一大摊。
    借工具、借图纸，跑来跑去费时间。
    这里争，那里吵，动嘴多，动手少。
    事事都要干部搞，主人翁那能当得好。我们坚决支持了群众的这个合理要求，发动群众大破陈规，坚决、大胆地下放权力，改革体制，实行了干部参加劳动，建立了小组八大员管理的组织和制度，贯彻了“两参一改三结合”，调整了企业内部的关系，适应了生产力发展的要求，全厂的面貌焕然一新。工人们赞扬这个改革说：
    权力下放心畅快，生产我们自安排。
    工具图纸早准备，英雄有武用出来。
    不用三年和五载，英美老牌往后甩。
    党的群众路线在我厂干部中进一步生根，生产小组也逐步成长起来。实践证明，领导越是相信群众，群众的干劲就越大，就越能发挥无穷无尽的智慧和力量。随着工人群众政治觉悟的不断提高和生产的持续跃进，1959年初工人迫切要求继续下放权力，进一步参加企业的经济管理。他们说：“当家不理财，那能当好家。”但是，一些有右倾思想的人却说：过去“下放权力造成了混乱”，“把旧的规章制度丑化过分了”。他们怀疑和否定大搞群众运动的成绩，企图走回头路。我们发动群众坚决批判了这种错误思想，坚持了党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，坚决执行了省委和市委关于分级分权管理制度的指示，积极支持群众的要求，又把财权逐级下放。5月份，在全厂范围内，掀起了以小组核算为基础的经济核算的群众运动，一反过去少数人搞成本搞核算的冷冷清清的局面。勤俭办企业的思想进一步树立，节约之风大兴，出现了一个人人核算、个个理财的新气象。小组理财以后，工人们对于经济核算工作非常积极认真，而且做得又快又好。他们主动地提出先进指标和措施，建立了简明易懂和切实可行的原始记录、个人统计手册和八大员管理的账卡图表，建立和健全了班前抓计划、抓准备；班中抓检查；班后抓分析、抓评比等一整套小组管理制度，促使整个企业管理工作又大大前进了一步。小组核算开展以后，大大促进了技术革命的发展，而技术革命的开展又推动了经济核算。1959年全厂的成本指标，年初订的是降低7％，实际降低了26．8％。
    小组经济核算应当同工人阶级自觉的劳动竞赛和适当的物质奖励相结合。我们根据综合奖励的规定，结合我厂具体情况，制定和实现了“优胜小组奖励办法”。小组在每月完成产值、质量和费用三大指标，并无重大事故的前提下，超额完成生产任务，同时在政治思想工作、出勤率、协作配合、设备维护修理等方面都是很好的，按照不同的超额数计算发给奖金。每月10日赶上生产进度的为一等，20日前赶上进度的为二等，20日以后赶上进度的为三等。小组为了提前作好生产准备工作，一到每月20日左右，就主动向车间催要下月的计划指标、图纸卡片、材料工具。这样对于打破月初松、月末紧的常规，起了积极作用。奖励的具体办法是：只有小组得奖，个人才有奖励；个人奖金是根据每人在完成全组任务中的表现，分三级评定，个别不好的不得奖。奖励办法密切结合劳动竞赛，定期进行大评大比，在发给红旗、奖状的同时，发给奖金。这种办法深受群众欢迎，体现了坚持政治挂帅为主和适当物质奖励相结合的精神，避免了过去实行计件工资时，易于产生的某些妨碍群众积极性和创造性的经济主义倾向。小组经济核算、劳动竞赛和适当奖励，形成了一整套经常性的小组管理制度。这样互相推动，促使了运动的开展，促进了技术革命和管理水平的提高，保证了生产持续地大跃进。
    在这种情况下，一些原有的技术管理制度已经不能适应生产发展的要求，甚至束缚了群众的生产积极性。工人对于参加技术管理，特别是参加工艺管理的要求越来越迫切。我们又把工艺编制和产品设计权力，下放到小组。
    工艺是劳动者实践经验的总结。群众的创造愈多，工艺的内容也就愈先进和完善。过去有些技术人员把工艺神秘化，看作是一成不变和神圣不可侵犯的法规。工人们批评这种观点是“图纸上有虚线、有实线，就是没有群众路线。”通过反右倾斗争，技术人员提高了思想觉悟，加强了群众观点，逐渐从思想感情上接近了工人，也主动提出下放工艺，要求到小组安家落户。我们支持了这种积极建议。把工艺下放小组以后，更加发挥了工人当家作主的才能。例如量具分厂自动车床小组，自己编制工艺卡片后，把过去难于设计和制作的凸轮，自己设计自己制造，生产效率比下放前成倍提高，产品质量也有显著改进。技术人员们说：“到群众中去就有了办法”。
    技术人员和工人结合，一起总结先进标兵的经验，大大简化了工艺文件，并且创造性地编成诗歌、顺口溜等生动活泼的形式，使群众易学易懂，便于推行。先进操作法的不断出现和推广，使工艺规程经常保持着最先进的水平。这就保证了产品数量和质量的不断提高。
    工艺的简化和工人自己设计、编制工艺，促使技术人员从事务圈子里解放出来，有了较多的时间经常深入小组，参加讨论和审批工人们编制的新工艺，和工人共同研究解决技术问题，总结和推广小组已经试验成功的各种先进经验。这样不但有“放”，而且加强了“管”。因此，那种认为下放权力就会造成管理混乱的想法是不切合实际的。
    小组实行计划、财务和技术等全面管理以后，在加强对生产领导的同时，特别重视政治思想工作。许多小组的核心领导成员，处处起模范带头作用，真正作到了见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮，成为全组成员学习的榜样。同时，小组发动全体成员人人作思想工作，事事作思想工作，处处作思想工作，时时作思想工作。特别重视发动和组织老工人、先进生产者，通过各种各样的方式，向新工人或暂时处于落后状态的工人，进行阶级教育和劳动教育。帮助他们解开思想上的“疙瘩”；学习生产技术；合理地安排经济生活。工具车间田景琦小组，有一个工人一直不安心工作，最初工人们叫他“废品大王”。后来经过老工人、先进生产者和全组成员热情的帮助，这个工人提高了觉悟，变成了生产上的先进标兵。工人们写了一首顺口溜说：
    废品大王变标兵，小组人人喜在心，
    父亲忙来看喜报，妹妹要哥再鼓劲。
    许多小组除了规定有经常的政治学习制度外，还在生产现场建立了思想教育的宣传鼓动阵地，做到“好人好事一出现，喜报捷报就见面”。许多小组把政治思想工作深入到宿舍、食堂和生活的一切方面。有的小组还采取家庭访问的方式，发动家属们一起作思想工作。工人们赞扬小组“既是物质财富的生产组织，又是共产主义思想的教育组织。”在加强政治思想工作的同时，小组对文化技术学习、文化娱乐、体育、卫生以及探亲、储蓄等方面，也作到了合理的统一安排。真是“上有千条线，下有一根针”。一切工作有了群众性，就有经常性，一切任务一经落实到小组，就能够得到合理安排，很快实现。
    随着小组管理工作的不断发展，仅靠过去小组长和八大员的组织形式，就不能适应新的工作要求，必须相应的改变。进一步建立和健全以党的小组长为首的、党政工团小组长和各职能组长组成的核心领导。每个生产小组的成员适当增多，以便保持小组活动的一定独立性。各个小组设立了经济计划、生产准备、技术、宣传教育、生活等五个职能组，每组又设立若干职能员，分管各项工作，做到人人有事干，事事有人管。这样，既有广泛的群众性，又有坚强的集中领导，使生产小组真正发挥了基层战斗组织的作用。
    工人参加小组的全面管理工作，特别是参加技术管理以后，要求学习科学技术文化和理论知识的愿望更加强烈。许多小组都订立了远期和近期相结合的技术文化学习规划，广泛开展了包教包学、互教互学的技术培训和科学研究活动。全厂建立了从业余大学、中等技术、初中、高小到识字班的文化教育网，现在已有99．6％以上的职工，卷入了学习文化技术的热潮。今年大学将有机械、外文、文学、美术四个系各一个班共七十人毕业；中等技术学校有四十四人毕业。许多1958年进厂的新学工，现在已经达到了相当于二级或三级技工的水平，成批的普通生产者逐步达到技术员和工程师的水平。最近，我们准备将具备条件的二百多个工人分别提拔为工程师和技术员。这些都意味着工人和技术人员之间的差别正在逐步缩小，而且为最后消灭这种差别找到了途径。
    企业内部的各项管理工作落实到小组以后，凡是上面管的小组几乎什么都管，而且管得很好。工人们说：“我们虽然是个小组，但是样样都管，真像一个小工厂。”下放权力，使工人有了在实际工作中锻炼和提高管理企业能力的机会。现在，大约有20％的小组长，已经达到或接近车间领导干部的水平。再经过一定时期的锻炼，将能够达到厂一级领导干部的水平。到那时候，能够当厂长和其它管理人员的人就会多起来。事实上，两年来我们已经提拔了一百八十五个工人干部，担任科室和车间的领导工作。工人管理企业能力的迅速提高，新型管理人员的大批涌现，将使工人同管理人员和技术人员之间的差别逐步缩小。随着工人政治觉悟和技术水平的提高，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间差别的逐步消灭，必将彻底地根除资本主义的残余——官僚主义。这对于走向共产主义具有重大的意义。
    三、不断改进企业的管理工作
    干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，要求企业的管理工作不断进行改革，以适应生产力高速度发展的需要。我们把全厂业务相近、联系频繁的科室组织了七个办公室，把产品性质基本上相同的车间，合并组成五个分厂；又把厂部直属的热处理、机修、锻工、备料等车间全部下放到分厂，使各分厂建立起一套较完整的生产体系。这些改革又为干部参加劳动和工人参加管理创造了有利条件，进一步促进“两参一改三结合”制度的发展。同时，全厂各业务系统由科室、分厂、车间直到小组职能人员，上下左右，条条块块，贯通一气，开展了各系统的“一条龙”竞赛，使专业管理和群众管理真正结合起来。这就进一步实行了分级分权管理制度，加强了集中领导，密切了相互间的协作。
    在贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”的制度中，我们还摸索出了“一竿子、一揽子、一串子”群众路线的“三一”工作方法。“一竿子”是把党的决议指示迅速和群众见面，一竿子插到小组。“一揽子”是发现生产上的薄弱环节和关键问题，及时地召开有关领导人员、管理人员一直到工人参加的“三结合”会议，迅速解决。“一串子”是组织企业内部的共产主义大协作。这样，既可以作到上情充分下达，下情充分上达，防止领导脱离群众、脱离实际，减少官僚主义，又可以防止和克服过去多用行政命令、少和群众商量、互相制约、彼此推脱、是非不清、经常扯皮、影响生产的不良现象。同时更能充分发扬广大职工群众的共产主义协作的思想，主动联系，互相支持，密切配合，共同跃进。
      “两参一改三结合”制度的不断发展，为最后消灭脑力劳动同体力劳动之间的差别，过渡到共产主义社会创造必要的条件。当然要达到这个目标，还需要一段很长的时间，还必须不断地提高职工群众的文化水平和道德水平，也必然会遇到形形色色的资产阶级思想的阻挠。例如过去就曾经有人说什么“工人参加管理是义务而不是职务”，这种人以为只有他才能够管理社会主义的企业，工人群众则不可能也不应当管理社会主义的企业，这是资产阶级思想的反映。因此，继续贯彻执行这个制度，仍然是一个较长时期的思想斗争过程。
    几年来，我们依靠党的领导，依靠群众，在如何办好社会主义企业这个问题上，初步摸索出一些经验。但是，随着工作的不断发展，还需要不断地充实和提高。今后还会出现许多新的问题，还需要我们继续深入研究和摸索。这就要求我们必须认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习马克思列宁主义，不断提高领导水平，进一步把党所交给我们的社会主义企业办好。作到全党一条心、一股劲、一个样，为实现更好、更全面的持续大跃进而努力。
