Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th: The broad masses of the Tianjin people warmly support and endorse the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops shelling Jinmen in an armed anti-American demonstration, and are determined to strike at the "plague god" Eisenhower with practical actions, and resolutely liberate our territory of Taiwan.

Eisenhower, the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, enraged the broad masses of the Tianjin people by plotting new war schemes in the Far East. In recent days, many factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, people's communes, and PLA troops stationed in Tianjin have held gatherings. Steelworkers working beside the roaring furnaces severely condemned Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, for stepping onto our territory of Taiwan. Many steelworkers stated that since the "plague god" has arrived, we must give him a taste of our firepower. Workers from the Tianjin Special Model Group, the Qi Zisheng steelmaking group of the No. 1 Steel Plant, said that Eisenhower's new war provocations on our territory of Taiwan show he is underestimating the Chinese people. We must produce more steel and better steel to support the People's Liberation Army in punishing the aggressors. Workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill held 47 consecutive discussion meetings. Weaver Tian Shuqing said that Eisenhower's visit to the Far East was with ill intentions. His tricks have long been seen through by the Chinese people. If this paper tiger dares to show its claws and teeth again, we will smash it to pieces.

When the news of our army's shelling of Jinmen in an armed anti-American demonstration reached Tianjin's universities and colleges, the teachers and students were greatly encouraged and expressed their firm support. Nearly 10,000 teachers and students from Tianjin University and Nankai University held gatherings. Professor Shen Yulin of Tianjin University said that Eisenhower, who has done so many bad things, is now peddling the "two Chinas" scheme on our territory of Taiwan. We cannot tolerate this serious provocation, and we firmly support our army's shelling of Jinmen in an armed anti-American demonstration on the Fujian front. Teachers and students of the Normal University put up one hundred large-character posters protesting the war-monger Eisenhower's bandit-like trip. Employees of Tianjin's three major department stores—Quanyechang Department Store, Department Store Building, Women's and Children's Store—and many shops on Binjiang Road all decorated their windows with various cartoons, models, and slogans, exposing the ugly face of U.S. imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: Responsible persons from democratic parties and people's organizations in Hebei Province and Tianjin City, along with people from all walks of life, gathered today to severely condemn the U.S. war instigator Eisenhower's criminal activities in Asia to plot a new war. Those present unanimously stated their firm support for the just struggle of patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit-like trip. They said that any conspiracy by U.S. imperialists to create "two Chinas" will be thoroughly bankrupted. Yang Yizhou, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), said at the meeting that the Chinese people firmly protest the U.S.'s criminal provocative acts of escalating tensions in Asia, and resolutely oppose Eisenhower's shameless act of stepping onto our sacred territory of Taiwan. He said that we will never allow the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He hoped that the patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, who are still under the control of U.S. imperialism, will unite with the people of the motherland to drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan. Zhang Guofan, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu issued by the Fujian Front Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army fully reflects the wishes of the 650 million Chinese people. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and Eisenhower is the head of U.S. imperialism. Like a "plague god," he spreads toxins everywhere to undermine world peace. We resolutely oppose his bandit-like trip.

Responsible persons from provincial and municipal CPPCCs, Industry and Commerce Federations, as well as democratic parties such as the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiu San Society, also spoke at the meeting. Wu Yunshan, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that Eisenhower's trip to Asia has been met with anti-American storms in various Asian countries, demonstrating once again that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak inside. As long as the people of all countries persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to shatter all the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

Responsible persons from provincial and municipal people's organizations and representatives from all walks of life, including science, education, medicine, religion, and ethnic minorities, condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism at the meeting. Zhai Kang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out that all workers in Hebei Province and Tianjin City express their immense indignation and protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Eisenhower's bandit-like trip. The working class of the province is determined to fight to the end with the people of the whole country and with all peace-loving people of the world to shatter all the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism! Gu Yiran, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Zheng Sen, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Women's Federation, representing the entire youth and women of the province and city, stated that we will never stop fighting until the American aggressors get out of Taiwan, get out of Japan, get out of Korea, and get out of Asia!

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: People from all walks of life in Wuhan held a gathering on the 18th to warmly support the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops using artillery fire to "welcome and send off" Eisenhower, the public enemy of the people of the world.

He Yuankai, Standing Committee member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), and Tang Zhe, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said in their speeches that the decision of the Fujian Front Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to shell Jinmen when Eisenhower intruded into our territory of Taiwan is a demonstration against U.S. imperialism, and every shell represents the voice of the 650 million people of China. They pointed out that the bandit chieftain Eisenhower already stinks in the eyes of the Asian people. During his bandit-like trip to the Far East, he was opposed by the people wherever he went. The Fujian Front troops "welcoming and sending him off" with artillery fire is even more satisfying.

Jin Tongyin, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Wang Jiaji, Chairman of the Wuhan Branch of the Jiu San Society, pointed out that the provocative activities of U.S. imperialism can only be exposed and struck hard. The surging struggle of the Asian people has caused some of the U.S. imperialists' running dogs to be overthrown, while others are tottering. In order to plot new war conspiracies and at the same time save the fate of its running dogs, the bandit chieftain Eisenhower braced himself and made a bandit-like trip to various parts of the Far East. However, his conspiracy has been seen through by the people of Asian countries, and the Asian people will surely drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia.

Chen Jingshe, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Hua Yuqing, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, expressed warm support for the letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu issued by the Fujian Front Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They said that the shelling demonstration is a stern warning to the number one war-monger Eisenhower that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with.

Chen Huanying, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Chen Zhiguang, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said, "Welcome the robber with sticks." In order to support the anti-American struggle of the people of Asian countries and the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and to oppose the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and vainly attempt to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan, our army's shelling of Jinmen on the Fujian front expresses the wishes of the youth and workers of Wuhan. They also stated on behalf of the city's workers and youth that they will definitely use the practical action of building a socialist motherland at high speed to counter the aggression and provocation of U.S. imperialism.

Tang Wuyuan, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Wu Gengyang, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, pointed out that Eisenhower, disregarding the opposition of the Asian people, braced himself and made a bandit-like trip to Asia in a dispirited manner, attempting to cheer up and support his running dogs and suppress the people's resistance. However, things developed in the opposite direction. The more Eisenhower disregards the people's opposition, the more he arouses the people's anger. They warned Eisenhower that the people are not to be provoked.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: Responsible persons from democratic parties and people's organizations in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, along with people from all walks of life, held a forum on the afternoon of the 18th to angrily denounce the bandit-like trip of Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, and warmly support the anti-American demonstration shelling conducted by the artillery of our army on the Fujian front.

Ning Wu, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), said: "As soon as this wolf Eisenhower showed his face in Asia, he was pelted with stones by the people of the Philippines. He was afraid of being drowned by the angry ocean of the Japanese people and dared not go. This shows the awakening of the Asian people. Now, Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, is like a rat crossing the street, and everyone shouts to beat him." He said: "On the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in Taiwan, the Fujian Front Headquarters of our army announced an anti-American demonstration shelling, which fully reflects the contempt and disdain of the people of the whole country for the head of U.S. imperialism." Che Xiangchen, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "Eisenhower's bandit-like trip this time served as a negative example for the people of the world, especially the people of Asia. When he went to Taiwan, we 'welcomed and sent him off' with artillery fire. This solemnly shows that we will not allow U.S. imperialism to invade Taiwan." Chen Xianzhu, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: "Eisenhower vainly attempts to permanently invade our territory of Taiwan. We 'welcome and send off' this 'plague god' with artillery fire, so that he understands that the Chinese people must liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan and must not let his conspiracy succeed."

Fu Chengming, Vice Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of all workers in the province, expressed his firm support for the letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu issued by the Fujian Front Headquarters of our army. He said: "The days of imperialism running rampant are gone forever. Taiwan is an inseparable part of our territory, and we will never allow the U.S. conspiracy to create 'two Chinas' to succeed. We must liberate Taiwan. Eisenhower's criminal activities can only arouse greater anger and firm opposition from us." Han Zishen, Deputy Director of the Liaoning Provincial Women's Federation, said: "It is gratifying and heartening to 'welcome and send off' Eisenhower with artillery fire. Inspired by the anti-American armed demonstration on the Fujian front, the women of our province must participate in socialist construction and the struggle to defend world peace with greater enthusiasm." Wu Yongli, Standing Committee member of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Liaoning Provincial Youth Federation, representing the youth of the province, stated: Resolutely oppose the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and firmly support the patriotic and just struggle of the youth of various Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: Responsible persons from local organizations of democratic parties in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City and leaders of various people's organizations held a gathering this morning to angrily condemn the bandit-like trip of Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, to the Far East, strongly protest against this number one war-monger stepping onto our sacred territory of Taiwan, and resolutely support the shelling of Jinmen by the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops in an armed anti-American demonstration.

Xiao Junying, Deputy Director of the Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), spoke first at the meeting. He said that the number one war-monger Eisenhower has come with ill intentions. He has come from the eastern side of the Pacific to the western side of the Pacific in order to maintain the U.S. imperialist aggression base in Asia and to strengthen its oppression of the people of various Asian countries. For such a "plague god," we must fiercely counterattack him and expose his criminal conspiracy in front of the broad masses of the people. The People's Liberation Army's armed anti-American demonstration on the Jinmen front expresses the wishes of the entire Chinese people, and we express our firm support and endorsement.

Wang Yue, member of the Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that Eisenhower's bandit-like trip once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the pillar of the most reactionary and decadent forces in Asian countries and the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asian countries. When Eisenhower arrived in Taiwan, our army on the Fujian front launched an anti-American armed demonstration, giving him a head-on blow. This shows the disdain and contempt of the great Chinese people for U.S. imperialism, and at the same time shows the determination of the Chinese people to resist aggression and realize the unification of the motherland. Under the firm blows of the Chinese people and the Asian people, U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to plot a new war and its activities of hostility towards the Asian people will surely be completely defeated.

Fang Wenyu, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said that the earth-shattering rumble of artillery fire from our army on the Fujian front is to let U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower know that the 650 million Chinese people under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China will never allow U.S. imperialism to act recklessly. All the criminal activities and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are destined to suffer a shameful defeat.

Qiu Lin, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: The thunderous sound of shelling Jinmen is the roar of 650 million Chinese people against U.S. imperialism's occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan, and it is the roar of our people against U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He hopes that all patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu will recognize the general trend, unite, and work with the people of the whole country to fight to drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan.

Guan Yun, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Deng Jian, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Women's Federation, Liao Yue, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Youth Federation, and Feng Naichao, Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, also spoke at the meeting.

    据新华社天津18日电　河北省、天津市各民主党派、人民团体负责人和各界人士今天集会，严厉谴责美国战争祸首艾森豪威尔到亚洲策划新战争的罪恶活动。到会的人们一致表示坚决支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。他们说美帝国主义者制造“两个中国”的任何阴谋，都将遭到彻底破产。民革河北省委员会主任委员杨亦周在会上说，中国人民坚决抗议美国加剧亚洲紧张局势的罪恶挑衅行为，坚决反对艾森豪威尔无耻地踏入我国神圣领土台湾的罪恶活动。他说，我们决不允许美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，希望仍处在美帝国主义控制下的台湾爱国军民同胞，和祖国人民团结在一起，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。民盟天津市主任委员张国藩说，中国人民解放军福建前线司令部所发表的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，完全反映了六亿五千万中国人民的意愿。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，艾森豪威尔是美帝国主义的头子，他像“瘟神”一样到处散播破坏世界和平的毒素，我们坚决反对他的强盗旅行。

    民进武汉市委主任委员金通尹、九三学社武汉分社主席王家楫指出，对美帝国主义的挑衅活动，只有狠狠地揭露和打击。亚洲人民风起云涌的斗争，使美帝国主义的走狗有的被赶下了台，有的摇摇欲坠。强盗头子艾森豪威尔为了策划新的战争阴谋，同时为了挽救它的走狗的命运，硬着头皮到远东各地作强盗旅行，可是他的阴谋已被亚洲各国人民识破，亚洲人民一定会把美帝国主义从亚洲赶出去。
    武汉市工商联主任委员陈经畲、民建武汉市委主任委员华煜卿表示热烈拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书。他们说，打炮示威，是给头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔的严正警告，中国人民不是好欺侮的。

    农工民主党武汉市委主任委员唐午园和政协湖北省武汉市委员会副主席吴耕阳指出，艾森豪威尔不顾亚洲人民的反对，硬着头皮灰溜溜地到亚洲作强盗旅行，妄图为他的走狗打气撑腰，压制人民的反抗。可是事情却向它的反面发展，艾森豪威尔越是不顾人民的反对就越发激起人民的愤怒。他们警告艾森豪威尔说，人民是不好惹的。
    新华社沈阳19日电　辽宁省和沈阳市各民主党派、各人民团体负责人和各界人士，18日下午举行座谈会，愤怒斥责美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，热烈支持福建前线我军炮兵进行的反美大示威炮击。
    民革辽宁省委员会主任委员宁武说：“艾森豪威尔这只狼在亚洲一露面，便吃了菲律宾人民的石头。他怕被日本人民的愤怒海洋淹没，不敢前往了。这显示出亚洲人民的觉醒。现在，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔好像过街的老鼠，人人喊打。”他说：“在艾森豪威尔到台湾的前夕，我军福建前线司令部宣布进行反美大示威炮击，这充分地反映了全国人民对美帝国主义头子的藐视和鄙视。”民进辽宁省委员会主任委员车向忱说：“艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行，当了世界人民特别是亚洲人民的反面教员。他到台湾，我们用炮火‘迎送’，这庄严表示了我们不容美帝国主义侵略台湾。”民盟辽宁省委员会主任委员陈先舟说：“艾森豪威尔妄图永远侵略我国领土台湾。我们用炮击‘迎送’这个‘瘟神’，就是让他懂得中国人民一定要解放我国神圣领土台湾，决不能让他的阴谋得逞。”

    民革中央委员会、广东省委员会副主任委员萧隽英首先在会上发言。他说，头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔来者不善，善者不来，他这次从太平洋东边跑到太平洋西边来，是为了维持美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略阵地，为了加强它对亚洲各国人民的压迫。对于这么一个“瘟神”，我们必须狠狠地反击它，必须在广大的人民面前揭穿它的罪恶阴谋。人民解放军在金门前线举行反美武装示威，表达了全中国人民的意愿，我们表示坚决支持和拥护。
    民盟中央委员、广东省委副主任委员王越说，艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行，再一次证明了美帝国主义是亚洲各国最反动最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲各国人民最凶恶的敌人。在艾森豪威尔到达台湾时，福建前线我军举行反美武装示威，给他以迎头痛击，这表示了伟大中国人民对美帝国主义的蔑视和鄙视，同时表示了中国人民反抗侵略、实现祖国统一的决心。美帝国主义策划新战争的阴谋和敌视亚洲人民的活动，在中国人民和亚洲人民的坚决打击下，必将遭到彻底的失败。
    民建广州市委副主任委员方文瑜说，福建前线我军震天动地的隆隆炮声，是叫美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔知道：在伟大的中国共产党领导下的六亿五千万中国人民决不容许美帝国主义胡作非为。美帝国主义的一切罪恶活动和战争阴谋，都注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    台盟广州市支部副主任委员丘琳说：炮击金门的隆隆响声，是全中国六亿五千万人民反对美帝国主义霸占我国神圣领土台湾的吼声，是我国人民反对美帝国主义制造
  “两个中国”阴谋的吼声。他希望台、澎、金、马的全体爱国同胞，认清大势，团结起来，和全国人民一道，为把美帝国主义逐出台湾而斗争。
