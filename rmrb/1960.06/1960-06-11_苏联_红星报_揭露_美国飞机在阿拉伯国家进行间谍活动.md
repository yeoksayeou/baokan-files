    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: According to a report in the Soviet "Red Star" today, American spy planes are also conducting espionage flights in Arab countries.
    The newspaper cited a report from Istanbul by the Greek newspaper "News" that after the United States declared a halt to espionage flights in Soviet airspace, reconnaissance aircraft of the American "10-10" unit have intensified reconnaissance flights over Arab countries.
    American aircraft are conducting espionage flights over Arab countries along two specific routes: one from Adana in Turkey along the Turkish-Syrian border to Mardin in Turkey, then through Iran to Dhahran in Saudi Arabia; the other from Adana south along Syria, Lebanon, Israel to Al Arish in the United Arab Republic and Port Sudan in Sudan, and then to Dhahran. Flying along these two routes similarly passes through all areas of Arab countries.
    According to "News", two squadrons of American aircraft are stationed at the Ulus-Feld air base in Libya and the Dhahran air base in Saudi Arabia. These aircraft are under the command of the Near East Countries Special Intelligence Department of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

    苏联“红星报”揭露
    美国飞机在阿拉伯国家进行间谍活动
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　据苏联“红星报”今天报道，美国间谍飞机也在阿拉伯国家作间谍飞行。
    这家报纸援引希腊“新闻报”来自伊斯坦布尔的消息说，在美国声明停止在苏联领空作间谍飞行以后，美国“10—10”部队的侦察飞机加强了对阿拉伯国家的侦察飞行。
    美国飞机沿着两条专门路线对阿拉伯国家作间谍飞行：一条是从土耳其的亚达那沿着土叙（叙利亚）边境到土耳其的马尔丁，然后，经过伊朗到沙特阿拉伯的扎赫兰；另一条是从亚达那向南沿着叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列到阿拉伯联合共和国的阿里希和苏丹的苏丹港，然后再到扎赫兰。沿这两条路线飞行，同样都经过阿拉伯国家的全部地区。
    据“新闻报”报道，在利比亚的乌卢斯—费尔德和沙特阿拉伯的扎赫兰空军基地，驻有两个中队的美国飞机。这些飞机属美国中央情报局近东国家专门情报部指挥。
