Xinhua News Agency dispatch: An anti-American storm is raging across Japan. The 18th National United Action of the Japanese people immediately demonstrated this characteristic.

On the first day of the 18th National United Action on the 11th, in addition to the unprecedented large-scale anti-American and anti-Kishi demonstrations held in Tokyo, people in various parts of Japan also held grand demonstrations and rallies.

In Osaka, over 100,000 people from all walks of life held demonstrations and rallies in the afternoon and evening of the 11th to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan and demand the abolition of the new Japan-US "Security Treaty." At 2:00 PM, 60,000 government employees and students held rallies in three locations in Osaka, and then held demonstrations in the city. Thirty students from schools for the blind and deaf participated in the demonstration. It is also noteworthy that many middle school students participated in the demonstration. About 3,000 of them participated spontaneously. At 6:00 PM, another 40,000 people held a conference in Osaka's Ogimachi Park and held demonstrations in three routes. In addition, about 100 professors and scholars held a gathering at Osaka Normal University at 2:00 PM and passed a resolution demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The meeting immediately telegraphed this resolution to the Japanese government and the US Embassy.

In Kyoto, 24,000 people from all walks of life also held rallies and demonstrations on the 11th. Government employees and members of various mass organizations gathered in Nijo-cho from 1:00 PM. Students and members of cultural organizations held a gathering at 3:00 PM. Participants in both gatherings held demonstrations after the meeting. Workers from private enterprises and members of the Communist and Socialist parties then held rallies and demonstrations at 6:00 PM.

Seven thousand government employees, students, and professors in Kobe City held a gathering in front of the Kobe Customs. Later, another 25,000 workers held a rally and demonstration.

The call to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan is also growing louder in Japan. Many political parties, groups, and prominent figures have declared Eisenhower a "persona non grata."

In a statement issued on the 18th National United Action, the Japanese Socialist Party reiterated its opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan, demanding the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet.

The statement pointed out that the number of people participating in the grand rally in front of the Diet in Tokyo on the 11th exceeded 200,000. The Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's official residence and the US Embassy were completely surrounded by crowds holding red flags and placards. From Hokkaido to Kyushu, people from all walks of life in Japan participated in the nationwide mass demonstrations. The call to oppose the US President's visit to Japan is even louder. This is the characteristic of the unified action that began on the 11th. The statement said that under these circumstances, if the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet still attempts to prolong its life, insisting on inviting Eisenhower to visit Japan, and forcing the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet should bear the responsibility for all events that may occur in the future.

The Japanese Women Voters' League recently wrote to the US League of Women Voters, strongly requesting the US President to stop his visit to Japan, and calling on American women to launch a joint struggle with them for this purpose.

Twenty-eight professors and associate professors at Tokyo Women's University said in a letter sent to Eisenhower on the 11th that the current call against the Kishi Nobusuke government in Japan is not caused by a part of "radicals," and the letter asked Eisenhower to stop his visit to Japan.

With the development of the eighteenth united action, the Japanese people's anti-American struggle will become increasingly intensified.

Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, called on the Japanese people on the 11th to carry out a resolute struggle against the two enemies of US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries while speaking to 15,000 students gathered in the square behind the Diet. He said that the protest demonstration by workers and students at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on the afternoon of the 10th was a heroic protest action against US imperialism. Miyamoto Kenji also said, "We can be proud of this anti-imperialist action." Miyamoto said, "Hagerty drove into the midst of Japanese demonstrators in his car. He thought he could force his car through the demonstrators, he regarded the demonstrators as slaves. But the Japanese people are not slaves."

Referring to the conspiracy between the United States and the Japanese government, Miyamoto said, "The Kishi government requested the US to send Eisenhower to Japan to help it continue to govern. On the other hand, the US government ordered Kishi Nobusuke to have the new Security Treaty passed by the Senate on June 15 or 16. This fact shows that the Japanese people must fight against two enemies. He finally said, "We should carry out the struggle against these two enemies together with the people of the world. This is the most reliable road that will lead us to independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality."

The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag), also published an editorial on the 11th, emphasizing the need to intensify the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism.

The editorial said, "The current development of the situation shows that if the Japanese people do not carry out the struggle against US imperialism at the same time, their struggle against the reactionaries will not be effective."

The editorial emphasized that there are still many people in Japan who are afraid to oppose US imperialism, "We should not be afraid of imperialism. Those who are afraid of imperialism will be despised by the imperialists. Imperialists are only afraid of those who are not afraid to fight them."

The editorial pointed out that US Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty came to Tokyo to directly investigate the political situation in Japan in order to implement Eisenhower's plan to visit Japan. "There is no doubt that Eisenhower is here to save the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Security Treaty, which are now submerged in the tide of public opposition. This is why the Japanese people strongly oppose Eisenhower's visit."

    日本兴起猛烈反美风暴
    大阪京都神户近十六万人举行反美反岸示威
    各界人士宣布艾森豪威尔是“不受欢迎的人”
    “赤旗报”号召加紧反对美帝国主义的斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：反美风暴正在日本全国各地猛烈兴起。日本人民第十八次全国统一行动一开始就显示了这个特点。
    在11日第十八次全国统一行动的第一天，除了在东京举行了空前规模的反美反岸大示威外，日本各地人民也分别举行了盛大的示威和集会。
    大阪市，各界人民十余万人11日下午和晚上分别举行示威和集会，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，要求废除新日美“安全条约”。在下午两点钟时，六万名政府公务人员和学生在大阪市的三个地方举行集会，然后在市内举行示威游行。在示威队伍中有三十名盲聋学校的学生。另外令人注意的是有很多中学生参加了示威。他们之中大约有三千人是自动参加示威的。在晚上六点钟，又有四万人在大阪市的扇町公园里举行大会，并且分三路举行了示威游行。另外，大约一百名教授和学者下午两点钟在大阪师范大学举行集会并通过决议，要求岸信介内阁辞职，立即解散国会，并取消艾森豪威尔对日本的访问。会议并且立即用电报把这项决议拍给了日本政府和美国大使馆。
    在京都，各界人民二万四千人11日也举行了集会和示威。政府公务人员和各个群众团体的成员从下午一点钟起在二桥町集会。学生和文化团体的成员下午三点钟举行了集会。这两个集会的参加者在会后都举行了示威。私营企业的工人和共产党、社会党的党员接着在下午六点钟举行了集会和示威。
    神户市的七千名政府公务人员、学生和教授在神户海关前举行集会。后来，又有二万五千名工人举行了集会和示威。
    反对艾森豪威尔访日的呼声在日本也越来越高。很多政党团体和各界著名人士纷纷宣布，艾森豪威尔是“不受欢迎之人”。
    日本社会党11日在就第十八次全国统一行动发表的声明中就重申反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。
    声明指出，11日在东京参加国会前面广场大集会的人数超过二十万。岸信介首相官邸和美国大使馆完全被拿着红旗和标语牌的群众包围起来。从北海道到九州，日本所有各阶层人民都参加了全民性的大示威。反对美国总统访日的呼声更加高涨。这是11日开始的统一行动的特点。声明说，在这种情况下，如果岸信介内阁仍然企图苟延残喘，硬要邀请艾森豪威尔访日，强使国会通过新“安全条约”，今后可能发生的一切事件的责任应由岸信介内阁承担。
    日本妇女选民同盟最近写信给美国妇女选民同盟，强烈要求美国总统停止访日，呼吁美国妇女为此和她们共同展开斗争。
    东京女子大学二十八位教授和副教授在11日寄给艾森豪威尔的信中说，目前日本国内反对岸信介政府的呼声并不是由一部分“急进分子”造成的，信中要艾森豪威尔停止访日。
    随着十八次统一行动的开展，日本人民反美斗争将越来越加紧。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治11日在向聚集在国会后面的广场上的一万五千名学生讲话时就号召日本人民进行坚决的斗争，反对美帝国主义和日本反动派这两个敌人。他在谈到10日下午在东京羽田机场的工人和学生的抗议示威时说，这是反对美帝国主义的英雄抗议行动。宫本显治并且说，“我们可以为这种反对帝国主义的行动而感到自豪。”宫本说，“哈格蒂乘着车开进日本示威者的中间去。他以为，他可以使他的车子强行通过示威者，他把示威者看成为奴隶。但是，日本人民不是奴隶。”
    宫本在提到美国同日本政府之间的阴谋时说，“岸政府请求美国方面派艾森豪威尔到日本来帮助它继续执政。另一方面，美国政府命令岸信介使新安全条约在6月15日或16日由参议院通过。这个事实说明了，日本人民必须同两个敌人进行斗争。他最后说，“我们应当同全世界人民一起进行反对这两个敌人的斗争。这是会引导我们走向独立和平、民主和中立的最可靠的道路。”
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”11日也发表社论，强调指出有必要加紧日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    社论说，“目前局势的发展表明，如果日本人民不同时进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，他们反对反动派的斗争是不会有效的。”
    社论在谈到日本还有不少人不敢反对美帝国主义时强调指出，“我们不应当害怕帝国主义。那些害怕帝国主义的人将受到帝国主义者的轻视。帝国主义者只害怕那些不怕同他们进行斗争的人。”
    社论指出，美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂到东京是为了直接调查日本的政治局势以便实行艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划。“毫无疑问，艾森豪威尔是来挽救现在被淹没在公众的反对浪潮之中的岸信介内阁和安全条约的。这就是日本人民强烈反对艾森豪威尔访问的原因。”（附图片）
