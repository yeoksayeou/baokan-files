Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is blossoming and bearing fruit in Shanghai, a large industrial city, playing an increasingly powerful role in promoting production leaps. Many factories have recently seen fruitful production leaps after a vigorous period of technical revolution. As of the 29th, according to incomplete statistics, nearly a thousand factories in the city have completed their May production plans ahead of schedule, with over a hundred of them also completing half of their annual plans.

The technical revolution movement has brought about a new situation in Shanghai's second-quarter production that is very different from previous years. Especially after entering "Red May," all sectors have deeply and meticulously focused on consolidating, promoting, and improving the results of technical innovations, rapidly spreading many effective advanced experiences and powerfully promoting the development of production. After the call for "one equals several" was issued at the industrial conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in early May, the broad masses of workers were even more invigorated and enthusiastic, forming a mass movement to strive for "one person doing the work of several, one unit of material being used as several, one factory doing the work of several, and one product being used as several." This has combined technical revolution and production more closely, not only pushing the movement to a new stage but also more significantly demonstrating its effect on production. Since the latter half of the month, good news has kept pouring in, with batches of factories excellently completing their "Red May" production tasks ahead of schedule. This month, the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant mobilized all its workers to comprehensively inspect and summarize the technical innovation achievements of the previous period. Now, 98% of the machine tools in the plant have achieved single-machine automation and semi-automation, and more than 12,000 innovation projects and 56 production lines have been put into normal production. In the first five months of this year, the factory's three major products—turbo generators, electric motors, and transformers—have completed more than 60% of their annual plans. The Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, which supports the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant, has produced approximately 70% of its annual planned output of steam turbines in these five months.

In response to the new situation of generally increased raw material consumption after the launch of the technical revolution, Shanghai's industrial departments have adopted various methods to focus on increasing production, conserving materials, and comprehensive utilization, tapping great potential and playing a significant role in completing plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 31st: The broad masses of workers on Tianjin's industrial front have achieved brilliant accomplishments in the "Great Battle of Red May." As of the 29th, more than 150 factories and enterprises have completed their half-year state plans and May leap forward plans respectively.

Since entering May, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on Tianjin's industrial front has become increasingly in-depth, and the broad masses of workers are fighting more courageously. Through large-scale promotion, consolidation, and improvement, all sectors have closely integrated innovation results with current production, generally achieving large-scale harvests, and the production level has been increasing month by month, showing a new and thriving situation. Tianjin Integrated Chemical Plant No. 2 promptly applied the newly tested and successful techniques and technologies to production in the technical innovation movement, promoting the production level to rise linearly, increasing by 230% in May compared to April. The factory completed 56% of the annual plan thirty-six days ahead of schedule on the 25th of this month.

In the "Great Battle of Red May," Tianjin's factories and enterprises also launched a mass movement of "demanding raw materials from waste and scraps; vigorously running comprehensive utilization and diversified management satellite factories." For example, workers at the Yongda Hypochlorite Plant proposed the slogan "Refine treasures from waste residue and waste liquid, don't ask the state for raw materials." They actively contacted sixteen units, including the Weijin Chemical Plant and the Tianjin Pesticide Plant, to establish relationships for supplying scraps and waste liquid, so that all the main products used scraps and waste materials, thereby continuously leaping forward in production. As of the 20th of this month, the factory had completed 51% of its annual plan, an increase of 1.6 times compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 31st: Hundreds of thousands of workers in the steel capital of Anshan held a mobilization and competition radio conference on the afternoon of the 30th, determined to work hard in June to ensure the completion of half of the annual steel and steel materials production plan three to ten days ahead of schedule in the first half of the year.

Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting first, calling on the entire party and people of Anshan to mobilize, unite as one, and work together to work hard in June to ensure the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, laying a solid foundation for achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward throughout the year. To this end, Yang Shijie asked all departments to focus on key links such as raw materials, fuel, and transportation, continue to deepen the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and quickly summarize and promote effective new technologies and new experiences. At the same time, party organizations at all levels should properly arrange the production, study, and life of workers, so as to achieve a balance between work and rest and ensure the continued leap forward of production.

Yuan Zhen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel, on behalf of all Anshan Iron and Steel workers, expressed his firm response to the call of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, ensuring the completion of half of the annual steel and steel materials production plan three to ten days ahead of schedule in the first half of the year.

As soon as Yuan Zhen's speech ended, Sun Meiwu, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant No. 1, immediately took the stage and challenged the brother steel plants on behalf of all the workers. Representatives from the second and third steel plants immediately responded to the challenge from the first steel plant with the great aspirations of all their workers.

Zhang Zhonghou, Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, on behalf of all the workers of the plant, assured the steel-winning heroes at the conference: "We will let the blast furnace produce as much pig iron as needed, ensuring that the open-hearth furnace is fed fully and on time." Representatives from the Anshan Iron and Steel's important raw material base—the Dagushan Iron Mine—guaranteed that the blast furnace would be fed better and more fully.

Speaking at the meeting on the 30th were also representatives from the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Department, Anshan Iron and Steel Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute, Black Metal Mine Design Institute, Anshan Rolling Mill Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Commercial Bureau. They all expressed their firm response to the call of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, fully supporting Anshan Iron and Steel in achieving the guarantee of completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 31st: The Anshan Iron and Steel Mining System completed the May state production plan two days ahead of schedule with an excess of 11.1%. The average daily iron ore production level in May increased by 23.3% compared to April. The daily production levels of the five major iron mines, including Gongchangling, East Anshan, Cherry Orchard, Dagushan, and Dalizi, increased by 12% to 50% or more compared to April.

    上海天津上千工厂红五月生产满堂红  鞍钢力争提前三到十天完成半年任务
    据新华社上海31日电　技术革新和技术革命运动正在上海这个大工业城市开花结果，在促进生产跃进方面发挥出愈来愈大的威力。许多工厂前一个时期技术革命轰轰烈烈，最近以来生产跃进果实累累。截至29日为止，据不完全的统计，全市已有近千家工厂提前超额完成了5月份的生产计划，其中一百多家工厂还完成了今年全年计划的一半。
    技术革命运动使上海第二季度的生产出现了一个和往年大不相同的新局面，特别在进入红5月以后，各行各业都深入细致地大抓技术革新成果的巩固、推广和提高工作，使许多行之有效的先进经验迅速推广，有力地促进了生产的发展。5月初闭幕的中共上海市委召开的工业会议上，发出了“一顶几”的号召后，广大职工精神更加振奋，情绪更加饱满，形成了一个力争“一个人顶几个人用，一分材料顶几分材料用，一个厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用”的群众运动，把技术革命和生产结合得更加紧密，不但把运动推向一个新阶段，在生产上的效果也更显著地表现出来。下旬以来，捷报不断传来，一批又一批的工厂出色地提前完成了红5月的生产任务。上海电机厂在这个月内，发动全厂职工把前一时期的技术革新成果加以全面的检查和总结，现在全厂已有98％的机床实现了单机自动化和半自动化，有一万两千多个革新项目和五十六条生产流水线都投入了正常生产。今年头五个月内，这个厂的三种主要产品——汽轮发电机，电动机，变压器，都完成今年全年计划的60％以上。同上海电机厂产品配套的上海汽轮机厂，这五个月内汽轮机的总产量，已完成全年计划的70％左右。
    上海各工业部门针对技术革命开展以后原材料消耗普遍增加这一新情况，采取各种办法，大抓特抓原材料的增产节约和综合利用工作，挖出了很大的潜力，对完成计划起了很大的作用。
    据新华社天津31日电　天津市工业战线上的广大职工在大战红5月中取得辉煌成就。截至29日止，共有一百五十多个工厂企业分别完成了上半年国家计划和5月份跃进计划。
    进入5月以来，天津工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动越来越深入，广大职工越战越勇。各行各业通过大推广、大巩固、大提高，使革新成果与当前生产紧密结合，普遍获得了大面积丰收，生产水平逐月提高，出现了蒸蒸日上的新局面。天津市综合化工二厂在技术革新运动中把试验成功的新工艺新技术及时地运用到生产上，促进生产水平直线上升，5月份比4月份提高了230％。这个厂已在本月25日提前三十六天完成全年计划的56％。
    在大战红5月中，天津各工厂企业还掀起了“向废料、下脚料要原材料；大办综合利用多种经营卫星工厂”的群众运动。例如，永达海波化工厂职工提出“废渣废液炼百宝，不向国家要原料”的口号，主动地同卫津化工厂、天津农药厂等十六个单位联系，建立供应下脚料、废液的关系，使主要产品全部使用下脚料和废料，从而生产不断跃进；到本月20日止，这个厂已完成全年计划的51％，比去年提高一点六倍。
    据新华社鞍山31日电　钢都鞍山数十万职工在30日下午举行了誓师比武广播大会，决心大干6月，保证在上半年提前三天到十天完成全年钢铁和钢材生产计划的一半。
    中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰，首先在会上讲话，号召鞍山全党、全民大动员，大家一条心，上下一个样，拧成一股绳，大干6月，确保上半年完成全年计划的一半，为实现全年更好更全面的跃进奠定巩固的基础。为此，杨士杰要求各部门大抓原料、燃料和运输等关键环节，继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命运动，尽快地总结、推广行之有效的新技术和新经验。同时，各级党组织要很好地安排职工的生产、学习和生活，作到有劳有逸，保证生产的持续跃进。
    中共鞍山市委书记处书记兼鞍钢党委书记袁振，代表全鞍钢职工在会上表示，坚决响应中共鞍山市委的号召，保证在上半年提前三天到十天完成全年钢铁和钢材生产计划的一半。
    袁振的讲话刚刚落音，鞍钢第一炼钢厂党委书记孙梅武立即上台，代表全厂职工向兄弟炼钢厂挑战。第二、第三炼钢厂的代表，立即带着他们全体职工的雄伟的意愿，向第一炼钢厂应战。
    鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长张忠厚代表全厂职工在大会上向夺钢英雄们保证：要多少生铁就让高炉吐多少铁，保证按时、按量让平炉吃饱喝足。鞍钢的重要原料基地——大孤山铁矿的代表，保证让高炉吃得更好更饱。
    在30日大会上发言的，还有鞍钢运输部、鞍钢修建部、鞍钢焦化耐火材料设计院、黑色金属矿山设计院、鞍山市轧钢机械厂、锅炉厂、商业局等单位的代表。他们纷纷表示，坚决响应中共鞍山市委的号召，全力支援鞍钢实现上半年完成全年计划一半的保证。
    据新华社鞍山31日电　鞍钢矿山系统提前两天超额11．1％完成了5月份国家生产计划，5月份铁矿石平均日产水平比4月份提高23．3％，弓长岭、东鞍山、樱桃园、大孤山、大栗子等五大铁矿的日产水平都分别比4月份增长12％到50％以上。（附图片）
