    Hebei People Fight Drought for Sowing and Grain
    Beijing Suburbs Continuously Carry Out Drought Resistance, Seedling Protection, Pest Control, and Disease Treatment
    (By Our Newspaper) The broad masses of cadres and people in Hebei Province, facing the severe threat of drought, have launched a large-scale struggle to resist drought, protect summer sowing, and ensure the survival of seedlings with the heroic spirit of "If the drought increases by one point, our enthusiasm increases tenfold."
    In Hebei, there has been no thorough rainfall for nearly two hundred and seventy days from October of last year until now. Under the leadership of the Party, the heroic people of Hebei have launched a struggle to resist drought, protect wheat, and ensure spring sowing since the beginning of this year. The entire province, the entire Party, and all the people have been mobilized, led by 50,000 Party committee secretaries at all levels, leading 200,000 rural cadres deep into the front lines of drought resistance, leading an army of more than 10 million people to fight tenaciously against the drought. Industrial, commercial, cultural, and educational departments across the province have also drawn more than 1.3 million people to support drought resistance. Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, have led the masses in vigorously developing water conservancy projects. After a long and arduous struggle, more than 18,000 new machine wells and more than 200,000 brick wells have been dug throughout the province, more than 240,000 new and renovated canals have been built, and the irrigated area has been expanded and improved. In addition to carrying water for planting, spring crops have been sown on more than 69 million mu throughout the province. Currently, there are still 15 million mu of spring land and 35 million mu of summer stubble land being planted while fighting drought.
    In this drought resistance struggle, all localities have continued to implement the policy of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting, in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions. On the one hand, vigorous efforts have been made in water conservancy construction to enable areas with water sources to expand high-yield plots as much as possible during summer planting, striving to achieve high yields and multiple harvests in the autumn. On the other hand, all localities have concentrated superior forces to encircle and suppress "dead zone areas" lacking water sources, making every effort to find water sources and striving to plant all arable land in a timely manner. In order to ensure the sowing of dry land, Handan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other regions have extensively opened up water sources and actively resisted drought and rushed to plant by using methods such as multiple well convergence irrigation, pumping water up the mountains, and carrying water for spot watering.
    While vigorously grasping water capture and shock sowing, all localities have further strengthened the management of seedlings. After a week of shock work by 80,000 people in Renqiu County, the 130,000 mu of seedling fields lacking seedlings reached full seedlings. Without removing their armor or stopping their horses, they launched another shock battle to ensure strong seedlings, hoeing more than 300,000 mu of large field crops in three days, of which more than 200,000 mu were top-dressed with fertilizer.
    In the continuous struggle against drought, Party committees at all levels have also carefully arranged the lives of the masses, grasping livelihood as they grasp production. Earnestly implementing the policy of planned grain use and economical grain use, continuing to implement the spirit of "politics entering the canteen and secretaries entering the kitchen," vigorously developing canteen family production, vigorously reforming cooking tools, and vigorously grasping canteen management.
    The main problems currently existing in the drought resistance struggle in various localities are: irrigation and drainage machinery and drilling machinery cannot meet the needs of the drought resistance struggle. Party committees in various localities have taken vigorously grasping the supporting of engineering machinery as an important task, on the one hand, mobilizing various units to clear warehouses and tap the potential of drought resistance materials to support drought resistance; on the other hand, they have organized relevant departments to vigorously rush to produce, repair, and support irrigation and drainage machinery so that the machines can exert their effectiveness as soon as possible.
    (Xinhua News Agency) The broad masses of commune members in the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, under the strong leadership of Party organizations at all levels, have launched a continuous and tenacious struggle against the long-term drought and other natural disasters since the beginning of spring. Now, the suburban peasants, with high morale, are fighting heroically with drought-resistant summer planting as the center, striving to win the victory against disasters and achieve autumn harvest.
    Since the beginning of this spring, there has been a general lack of rain in various parts of the suburbs. After entering summer, the drought continues to threaten agricultural production.
    The broad masses of people in the suburbs have launched an unyielding struggle against the drought, seizing time and soil moisture, and most areas have completed the spring sowing task early, quickly, and well. After emergence, various places also universally launched seedling inspection and replanting activities. Transplanting and replanting were carried out on some plots of land that had serious loss of soil moisture and lacked seedlings, basically achieving full seedlings.
    Due to the continued development of the drought, the struggle to protect seedlings against drought has now been launched in various places. During the tense summer harvest and summer planting period, labor is properly arranged to add water, fertilizer, eliminate weeds, and preserve soil moisture to spring seedlings, so that some drought-stricken, withered, and curled seedlings can regain vitality and thrive. In some areas where insect plagues have occurred, in the spirit of "attack early, attack small, and attack thoroughly," they have actively launched a struggle against insect pests.

    有水源地区争高产多收　缺水地区保及时下种
    河北人民抗旱播种与天争粮
    北京郊区持续开展抗旱保苗除治病虫害斗争
    本报讯　河北省广大干部、群众在严重的干旱威胁面前，以“干旱增一分，干劲增十倍”的英雄气概，展开了规模宏大的抗旱保夏播、抗旱保全苗的斗争。
    河北各地从去年10月到现在，在将近二百七十天中没下透雨。英雄的河北人民，在党的领导下，从今年入春以来，就展开了抗旱保麦抗旱春播的斗争。全省全党全民总动员，由五万名各级党委书记挂帅，率领二十万农村干部，深入抗旱第一线，领导一千多万名抗旱大军，同干旱进行了顽强的搏斗。全省工业、商业和文教等部门也抽调一百三十多万人支援抗旱。各级党委根据河北省委的指示，领导群众，大抓水利建设。经过持久的艰苦奋战，全省新打机井一万八千多眼，砖井二十多万眼，新修和整修渠道二十四万多条，扩大和改善了灌溉面积，再加上担水点种等等，全省春播作物已播种了六千九百多万亩。现在，还有一千五百万亩春地和三千五百万亩夏茬地在抗旱抢种。
    在这次抗旱斗争中，各地都本着省委指示精神，继续贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针。一方面大抓水利建设，使有水源的地区在夏种中尽量扩大丰产方，力争秋季实现高产多收；另一方面都集中优势兵力，围攻缺乏水源的“死角区”，千方百计，突击找水源，力争把一切耕地都能适时种上。邯郸、保定、石家庄等地区，为了保证旱地播种，广开水源，并用多井汇浇，扬水上山和担水点浇等办法，积极抗旱抢种。
    各地在狠抓夺水突击播种的同时，还进一步加强了幼苗管理。任丘县八万名苗田管理大军，经过一周突击，使十三万亩缺苗断垅的苗田达到全苗以后，兵不卸甲、马不停蹄，又掀起了一个确保苗壮的突击战，三天当中就锄大田作物三十多万亩，其中二十多万亩追了肥。
    在持续的抗旱斗争中，各级党委还认真安排好群众生活，像抓生产一样抓生活。认真贯彻计划用粮、节约用粮的方针，继续贯彻政治进食堂书记下伙房的精神，大搞食堂家底生产，大搞炊事工具改革，大抓食堂管理。
    当前各地抗旱斗争中存在的主要问题是：排灌机械和钻井机械不能满足抗旱斗争的需要。各地党委都把狠抓工程机械配套，作为一项重要任务，一面发动各个单位，清理仓库，挖掘抗旱物料的潜力，支援抗旱；一面组织有关部门大力突击排灌机械生产、修配和配套，使机器尽快发挥效益。
    据新华社讯　北京郊区各人民公社的广大社员，在各级党组织的坚强领导下，同入春以来长时期的干旱和别的自然灾害，展开了持续不断的顽强斗争。现在，斗志昂扬的郊区农民，正在以抗旱夏种为中心，为夺取抗灾胜利和秋季丰收而英勇奋战。
    今春以来，郊区各地普遍缺雨，进入夏季以后，旱象仍继续威胁农业生产。
    郊区广大群众，同干旱展开百折不挠的斗争，抢时间抢墒情，大部分地区都又早、又快、又好地完成了春播任务。出苗以后，各地又普遍展开了查苗补苗活动。对一些因严重失墒，缺苗断垅的地块，进行移苗、补苗，基本上做到了全苗。
    由于旱象的继续发展，目前各地又展开了抗旱保苗的斗争。在紧张的夏收、夏种期间，妥善安排劳力，给春苗加水、加肥、灭草、保墒，使一些受旱枯萎卷叶的幼苗，重新生机勃勃，欣欣向荣。一些发生虫灾的地区，本着“打早、打小、打了”的精神，和虫害积极展开了斗争。
