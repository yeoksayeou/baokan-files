Yesterday a Lake Field Garbage Dump, Today a Clean and Happy Village
Futian Commune Combines Production to Achieve Ten Major Sanitary Reforms

(Our dispatch) The Futian Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, under the leadership of the Party, has launched a patriotic health campaign in conjunction with production, achieving ten major sanitary reforms, fundamentally changing the sanitary conditions, and promoting the development of production.

The Futian Commune in Pingxiang County is located in a mountainous area. In the past few years, although it has made considerable achievements in carrying out health campaigns, it has not completely changed the sanitary conditions. The Commune Party Committee was determined to change the backward state of health work. In February of this year, with the assistance of the County Party Committee working group, it conducted a pilot project for health work in the Futian Brigade. The Commune Party Committee decided to combine the health campaign with the current production movements of accumulating manure, making fertilizer, and transforming low-yield fields. In this way, it would not only improve sanitation but also promote production. At the same time, it was determined to launch a large-scale mass movement to carry out thorough reforms. He Hesheng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, personally took charge, formulated a plan, and put forward the slogan of "Six Changes and Six Transformations," that is, changing private toilets to public toilets, changing open ditches to covered ditches, and achieving smooth flow, etc. More than 300 male and female laborers in the Futian Brigade carried out a large-scale sanitation and manure accumulation movement every day. During the movement, the masses raised issues such as preparing boiled water in the canteen, disinfecting tableware, and renovating pigsties. The Commune Party Committee immediately studied the issues raised by the masses and decided to carry out fundamental reforms on the basis of "Six Changes and Six Transformations," and convened cadres and the masses to study and discuss. Someone from the Fifth Production Team suggested building an insulated box, which could not only disinfect tableware but also keep the food hot, ensuring that commune members who finished work late also had hot food and dishes to eat. The Commune Party Committee gathered the opinions of the masses and decided on ten innovation projects. Thus, a mass health movement to carry out ten major sanitary innovations was launched.

In order to closely integrate the health campaign with production, a method of four combinations was adopted, that is, starting from cleaning the bottom of four things (cleaning the bottom of toilets, cleaning the bottom of cowsheds, cleaning the bottom of pigsties, and cleaning the bottom of poultry sheds), combining with sanitary manure accumulation; starting from developing pig raising, combining with building pigsties and improving environmental sanitation; starting from transforming low-yield fields, combining with establishing three-purpose field huts; and starting from eliminating pests and diseases, combining with launching major sanitary reforms and physical exercises to enhance the people's physical fitness.

The Futian Brigade first focused on the sanitary reform of collective living areas such as public canteens, and then reformed toilets and pigsties. The sanitary conditions of the commune members' homes were also greatly improved. After more than ten days of hard work, the commune members finally achieved ten major sanitary innovations, completely changing the sanitary conditions.

These ten major innovations are: 1. Establish insulated disinfection boxes in each canteen to disinfect tableware using boiling water steam, while ensuring that commune members have hot meals and dishes; 2. Establish three-purpose insulated tanks near each canteen so that commune members can have hot water to wash their faces every day, and rinse their mouths with medicinal or salt water before meals to prevent epidemics; 3. Establish insulated bathrooms near each canteen so that commune members can take showers regularly; 4. Add three-purpose spittoons in public places such as canteens and clubs, and in commune members' homes: put paper scraps at the bottom, a spittoon in the middle, and a bonsai on top, which is both sanitary and beautiful; 5. Demolish one toilet per household, and establish public toilets for men and women based on natural villages. The toilet doors are equipped with foot-operated automatic switches. This not only achieves centralized management of feces, meets sanitary requirements, but also greatly reduces the infection of bacteria; 6. Establish high-yield manure storage cellars in each village, and lead the village's sewage into them through covered ditches, combine with garbage and turf, and ferment it into fertilizer, turning waste sewage into useful things; 7. Establish garbage bins in each village to collect garbage and transport it away regularly; 8. Change pigsties, leaving open space around the pigsties and enclosing them with fences to make playgrounds for the pigs. In this way, the pigs are not prone to illness and there is no odor; 9. Establish three-purpose field huts near remote fields and low-yield fields. The upper layer stores tools, the middle layer stores ash, and the lower layer digs cellars to compost manure, which can centrally manage fertilizer and is conducive to transforming low-yield fields and sanitation; 10. Establish sanitary manure accumulation stoves in the canteen, that is, put a wooden bucket on the chimney and put palm fiber in the bucket to collect soot, which increases fertilizer and improves sanitary conditions.

The experience of the Futian Brigade was quickly promoted in each production team and production squad. All communes have achieved ten major innovations and have received significant results. Now, the sanitary conditions here have been greatly improved. Everywhere is a scene of prosperity.

The masses' habit of paying attention to hygiene has been greatly promoted. A small cleaning every day, a big cleaning every three days, and a blitz every seven days have gradually become a habit; men, women, old and young rinse their mouths before meals every day, eat with their own tableware, use public chopsticks for eating dishes, and their clothes and bedding are also clean.

Through sanitary manure accumulation, 177 three-purpose field huts and 198 manure cellars have been established on low-yield slopes, and 188 wide machine-耕 roads leading to low-yield slopes have been built, and hundreds of ditches have been opened. Since then, more than 8,000 mu of low-yield fields in the whole commune have been basically transformed. The pig raising industry has developed greatly, and 32 new collective pig farms have been built. The pigsties are spacious and suitable for use, and wooden rails or bamboo cableways have been erected to automate the transportation of soil and water.

The Pingxiang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting on health work in Futian Commune and promoted the commune's experience in ten major sanitary innovations throughout the county.

    昨日湖田垃圾地　今朝清洁幸福村
    福田公社结合生产实现卫生十大改革
    本报讯　江西省萍乡县福田公社，在党的领导下，结合生产，大搞爱国卫生运动，实现了卫生十大改革，根本改变了卫生面貌，促进了生产的发展。
    萍乡县福田公社地处山区，几年来，大搞卫生运动，虽然取得了不少成绩，但仍未彻底改变卫生面貌。公社党委决心改变卫生工作落后面貌，今年2月，在县委工作组的协助下，在福田大队进行卫生工作试点。公社党委决定把卫生运动同当前生产积肥、造肥和改造低产田的运动结合起来，这样既搞了卫生，又推动生产；同时，决心大搞群众运动，进行彻底改革。公社党委第一书记何和生同志亲自挂帅，制订了计划，提出“六改、六化”的口号，即改私厕为公厕，改阳沟为阴沟，实现流通化等。福田大队每天有三百多男女劳动力大搞卫生积肥运动。在运动中，群众提出食堂预备开水、餐具消毒、猪舍的改建等问题。公社党委立即研究了群众提出的问题，决定在“六改、六化”的基础上，进行根本的改革，并召集干部和群众研究讨论。第五生产队有人提出搞保温箱，不仅餐具可以消毒，还可以把饭菜放在保温箱里，保证收工晚的社员也有热饭、热菜吃。公社党委集中群众的意见，定了十个革新项目。于是一个大搞卫生十大革新的群众卫生运动开展起来了。
    为了使卫生运动紧密配合生产，采取了四结合的办法，即从四清底（厕所清底、牛栏清底、猪栏清底、家禽棚清底）入手，结合卫生积肥；从发展生猪入手，结合建猪舍、搞环境卫生；从改造低产田入手，结合建立三用田头屋；从除害灭病入手，结合大搞卫生改革和体育锻炼，增强人民体质。
    福田大队首先抓住公共食堂等集体生活区的卫生改革，然后改革厕所、猪舍。对社员们的家庭环境卫生也大力改进。社员们经过十几天的奋战，终于实现了卫生十大革新，彻底地改变了卫生面貌。
    这十大革新是：一、每个食堂建立保温消毒箱，利用沸水蒸汽使餐具消毒，同时保证社员都有热饭热菜吃；二、每个食堂设立三用保温缸，使社员每天都有热水洗脸，饭前有药水或盐水漱口，以预防疫病；三、各食堂邻近建立保温浴室，使社员们可以经常洗澡；四、在食堂、俱乐部等公共场所和社员家里添置三用痰盂：下面放纸屑，中间放痰盂，上面放盆景，既卫生又美观；五、拆除一户一厕，以自然村为单位建立男女公共厕所，厕所门装上脚踏自动开关。既做到粪便集中管理，合乎卫生要求，又大大减少了细菌的感染；六、在每个村庄建立丰产积肥窖，把全村的污水通过阴沟引进来，合上垃圾、草皮，发酵作肥料，使废污水变成有用之物；七、村村建立垃圾箱，收集垃圾，定期运走；八、改变猪舍，在猪舍的周围留出空地，用篱笆围起来，给猪做运动场，这样猪不易生病，又没有臭味；九、在远田、低产田附近，建立田头三用屋。上层放工具，中层放灰，下层挖窖沤肥积肥，可以集中管理肥料，有利于改造低产田，有利于卫生；十、在食堂建立卫生积肥灶，就是在烟囱上放一个木桶，桶内放棕，收集烟灰，既增加了肥料，又改善了卫生条件。
    福田大队的经验迅速在各生产队和生产小队普遍推行。全公社都实现了十大革新，并且收到了显著的效果。现在，这里的卫生面貌已经大大改观。处处是一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    群众讲卫生的风气大大发扬，每天一小扫，三天一大扫，七天一突击已逐渐成为习惯；男女老少每天饭前漱口，吃饭用自己的餐具，吃菜有公筷，衣服被褥也干干净净。
    通过卫生积肥，在低产坂上建立了一百七十七个三用田头屋，一百九十八个粪窖，修了通往低产坂的一百八十八条宽敞的机耕道，开了几百条水沟，从此全社八千多亩低产田基本上都得到了改造。养猪事业大发展，新建了三十二个集体养猪场，猪舍宽敞合用，还架上了木轨道或竹索道，运土、用水自流化。
    中共萍乡县委曾在福田公社召开全县卫生工作现场会议，在全县推广了这个公社关于卫生十大革新的经验。
