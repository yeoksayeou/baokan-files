    A Successful Experience in Promoting New Technologies

    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, should we rely on a small number of people to promote new technologies and experiences, or should we rely on the masses and launch a mass movement to promote new technologies? The experience of the Shanghai Huafeng Woolen Mill provides a vivid and concrete answer to this question. Initially, this factory did not fully mobilize the masses and relied only on a few people to promote new technologies. As a result, about half of the innovation projects were not promoted, and some workers even disliked using the new machines that had been installed. Later, the factory Party committee mobilized the masses to speak out freely and let the masses themselves carry out the appraisal, summarization, matching, and promotion of new technologies and experiences. As a result, the situation quickly changed. In less than half a month, the utilization rate of innovation projects increased from 50% to 95%, and the output of major products also increased by 24%. The workers all actively used new technologies. This fact shows that only by using the method of launching a mass movement can new technologies and experiences be promoted quickly and well, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, it will be slow and poor, achieving half the result with twice the effort.

    Why can launching a mass movement achieve such good results? This is because promoting new technologies and experiences is not as convenient as buying things; it cannot be used simply by getting it. It requires appraisal, summarization, matching, and improvement, and a series of corresponding preparations. Taking appraisal as an example, so many new technologies and experiences are created in so many fields that it is difficult to fully evaluate their effects in actual application and make correct appraisals by relying on the strength of a few people. Only by launching a mass movement can the wisdom and strength of the masses be concentrated, and the best experiences and technologies can be truly matched together. For example, the Tianjin Dazhonghua Rubber Factory adopted the advanced experience technology of "going to the market," mobilizing the masses to contribute experiences on the spot, performing on the spot, and appraising and matching on the spot. Many new creations that were not known in the past were discovered; some new experiences that could not be found in the past were matched on the spot; some new technologies and experiences that had already been matched were found to be better matched with new technologies and experiences. In just over two hours, they made all thirty-one processes in a workshop have a complete set of good experiences. If only a few people were to appraise and match, it would definitely be impossible to do it so quickly and well. Furthermore, new technologies and experiences are often not perfect when they first appear, and they need to be processed, matched, and improved. Of course, these tasks cannot be done well by a few people. In addition, the promotion work itself is a process of breaking the old and establishing the new. To establish the new, we must do specific preparatory work well. For example, to knock down the scaffolding that has been used for thousands of years overnight, like the construction industry in Shenyang, we must prepare new machinery to replace the scaffolding in advance. This work can only be done quickly and well by fully mobilizing the masses.

    Even if the new technology or new experience itself is very perfect, and all the preparations that need to be done have been done, it will not be possible to promote it quickly and use it well if the old habits are not broken in the mass movement. As a result of the long-term use of old technologies and experiences among the masses, people have mastered their objective laws, so they can use them more easily and are very accustomed to them. However, new technologies and experiences have just emerged, and people are not yet familiar with them and have not fully grasped their laws, so they are not easy to use and are not accustomed to them, and it is not easy to persist in using them. Since habits are formed in practice, they must be broken in practice. The most effective way to break them is for the masses to practice new technologies and experiences themselves. After the masses do the appraisal, summarization, matching, and promotion of new technologies and experiences themselves, they will discover the superiority of new technologies and experiences in the comparison between the old and the new, consciously accept them ideologically, and consciously promote them. Of course, this goal cannot be achieved without launching a mass movement.

    From the masses, to the masses, is the fundamental political and organizational line of our Party. All work can only be done quickly and well by believing in the masses and relying on the masses from beginning to end. There is a view that the creation of inventions can be done through a mass movement, but the promotion work can only be done by a few technicians. This view is actually still a wrong view that does not believe in the wisdom and creativity of the masses. We should firmly believe that since the masses can create inventions, they will certainly be able to do a good job in promotion and improvement. In fact, the creation of inventions and the promotion of use are closely related. Since the masses have created it, they must have more ways to promote it and improve it. We advocate that the promotion of new technologies should be carried out through a mass movement, without neglecting the role of technicians in the slightest. On the contrary, we advocate that management personnel, technical personnel, and the broad masses of workers should combine to do the promotion work quickly and well.

    From creation and invention to promotion and use, we must consistently adhere to the mass movement, and we must realistically and earnestly appraise and summarize new technologies and experiences. In addition, we should also practically and specifically solve the problems that arise in the process of promoting new technologies, and ensure that business management, production management, and technical management keep up with them, so that we can truly ensure that every successful new technology and new experience is quickly applied to production. The experience of Shanghai Huafeng Woolen Mill in quickly promoting new technologies through a mass movement is a successful experience. It tells us that we must do the promotion of new technologies meticulously and down-to-earth, and not be satisfied with how many innovation and creation projects we already have. All factories and mining enterprises can emulate the methods of Huafeng Woolen Mill, and through mass movements, appraise, match, and improve all the innovation achievements of their enterprises, and apply them to production in a practical and concrete way. This will further guarantee that the production in the third quarter will have a greater increase.

    推广新技术的一个成功经验
    在技术革新、技术革命运动中，是依靠少数人做新技术、新经验的推广工作呢？还是依靠群众，大搞群众运动来推广新技术呢？上海华丰毛纺厂的经验在这方面作出生动具体的回答。这个厂开初由于没有充分发动群众，只依靠少数人做新技术的推广工作。结果有一半左右的革新项目没有得到推广，甚至有的新机器安装好了工人还是不喜欢用它。后来，厂党委发动群众大鸣大放，让群众自己动手做新技术、新经验的鉴定、总结、配套、推广工作，结果，局面迅速改观，在不到半个月时间内，就使革新项目的使用率由50％上升到95％，主要产品的产量也随之提高了24％。工人们都人人积极地使用新技术。这个事实说明了只有用大搞群众运动的方法，才能使新技术、新经验推广得又快、又好，收到事半功倍的效果。反之就又慢又差，事倍功半。
    为什么大搞群众运动就能收到这样良好的效果呢？这是因为推广新技术、新经验并不像买东西那徉方便，只要拿到手就可以用。它需要进行鉴定、总结、配套、提高，需要做一系列相应的准备工作。即以鉴定来说，新技术、新经验创造得那样多、方面也那样广，依靠少数人的力量就很难充分估价它在实际运用中的效果，并且作出正确的鉴定。只有大搞群众运动才能把群众的智慧和力量集中起来，真正做到把最好的经验技术配搭在一起。比如天津大中华橡胶厂采用先进经验技术“赶集”的办法，发动群众现场献经验，现场表演，现场鉴定、配套，许多过去不知道的新创造发现了；一些过去找不着对象的新经验，当场配搭上了；一些已经配套了的新技术、新经验，又找到了更好的新技术、新经验相配合。仅仅在两个多小时之内，他们就使一个车间的三十一道工序，全都有了成套的好经验。如果只是少数人去鉴定、配套，肯定是不可能办得这样又快又好的。再就是新技术、新经验在最初出现时往往是不够完善的，它需要做加工、配套、改进的工作，这些工作，少数人当然也是办不好的。此外，推广工作本身就是一个破旧立新的过程，要把新的树立起来，就一定要做好具体的准备工作。比如要像沈阳市建筑业那样在一夜之间放倒千百年沿用的脚手架，就必须事前准备好代替脚手架的新机具。这个工作，也只有充分发动群众，才能做得又快又好。
    即便新技术或新经验本身十分完善，需要做的准备工作都做了，但如果不在大搞群众运动中破除旧的习惯势力，要想推广得快，使用得好，也是不行的。由于旧的技术和经验在群众中长期使用的结果，人们掌握了它的客观规律，因而使用起来比较得心应手，十分习惯。而新的技术和经验刚刚出现，人们对它还不太熟悉，还没有完全掌握它的规律，因而用起来就不大得心应手，不大习惯，也就不容易坚持使用。既然习惯势力是在实践中形成的，也就必须在实践中破除它。最有效的破除办法就是群众自己进行新技术、新经验的实践。当群众自己动手做新技术、新经验的鉴定、总结、配套、推广工作以后，就会在新旧对比中发现新技术、新经验的优越性，自觉地从思想上把它接受下来，自觉地去推广它。而要达到这个目的，不大搞群众运动，当然也是不行的。
    从群众中来，到群众中去，是我们党的根本政治路线和组织路线。一切工作都只有自始至终地相信群众，依靠群众才能做得又快又好。有一种看法，认为创造发明可以大搞群众运动，推广工作就只能由少数技术人员来做，这种看法，实际上仍然是不相信群众的智慧和创造力的错误看法。我们应当坚定地相信，既然群众能够创造发明，也就一定能够做好推广提高的工作。事实上创造发明和推广使用是密切相连的，群众既然创造了它，也一定有更多的办法去推广它，提高它。我们提倡新技术的推广工作要大搞群众运动，丝毫没有忽视技术人员的作用。相反，我们提倡管理人员、技术人员和广大工人群众结合起来，把推广工作做得又快又好。
    从创造发明到推广使用，必须始终如一地坚持大搞群众运动，必须实事求是地做到对新技术、新经验认真地加以鉴定、总结；此外，还应当切实地、具体地解决推广新技术过程中出现的间题，并且使经营管理、生产管理和技术管理等工作紧紧跟上去，这样才能真正做到把每一项成功的新技术、新经验都迅速地用于生产。上海华丰毛纺厂大搞群众运动迅速推广新技术的经验，是一个成功的经验，它告诉我们必须细致踏实地做新技术的推广工作，而不要满足于已经有了多少多少革新创造项目。一切厂矿企业都可以仿效华丰毛纺厂的办法，通过群众运动把本企业所有革新成果经过鉴定、配套、提高，切切实实地运用到生产中去。这样就能够进一步保证第三季度的生产有更大的增长。
