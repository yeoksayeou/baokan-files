Resolutely Be Promoters of New Things
Wuming County, Guangxi, Concentrates People's Wisdom to Improve Rice Transplanters

    (Our dispatch) Guangxi's Wuming County, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement, has successfully improved the original 56-3 rice transplanter into the 59-3 Wuming-style rice transplanter with even better performance, and has widely promoted it throughout the county, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the masses. By June 1st, two thousand eight hundred and fifty-six rice transplanters had been produced and passed inspection, operated by more than three hundred rice transplanter professional teams composed of more than six thousand rice transplanter operators, showcasing their power in the intermediate rice fields.

    When Wuming County promoted the use of rice transplanters during the early rice season, some shortcomings appeared in the rice transplanters, leading to various discussions. Some praised them, others criticized them, and a few even attacked them as being a waste of manpower and resources. However, the Wuming County Party Committee unswervingly followed the mass line, treated new things with enthusiasm, and enabled this newborn infant—the rice transplanter—to quickly grow and become stronger. While continuously mobilizing the masses to criticize right-leaning thoughts and searching for the causes of the shortcomings, the Wuming County Party Committee, focusing on Shuangqiao Commune, conducted in-depth research and sent "medical teams" to various places to absorb experiences and lessons. Through various activities, mutual inspiration, collective research, and the combination of top-down efforts, and the integration of blacksmiths, carpenters, rice transplanter operators, and technicians, all advantages were concentrated, and improvements were gradually made, resulting in rice transplanters with performance that improved with each iteration. In early March, during a county-wide rice transplanter competition, it was discovered that the reciprocating wheels of two rice transplanters from Liangjiang Commune and Ganxu Commune were placed in the middle, and other connecting components were also modified accordingly, making them far superior to unimproved machines. The County Agricultural Machinery Bureau summarized and improved upon this, and first manufactured one for use in the Pingwen Brigade of Shuangqiao Commune. It was used continuously for seven days without needing repairs, proving that the modification was reasonable. In mid-March, it was promoted throughout the county, allowing it to return to the masses for further testing. At the end of March, it was discovered that the fixed seedling clip baffles of a machine from the Qiquan Brigade of Matou Commune had triangular holes opened in them, resulting in the seedling clips not carrying mud and the seedling distribution being more even. The County Party Committee immediately instructed for research, improvement, and enhancement, and arranged for the County Farm Tool Factory to produce and distribute them to various places. After these two rounds of partial improvements, the idea of comprehensively improving rice transplanters became more mature, and even more experience was gathered from below. At this time, the early rice transplanting had already ended, but the County Party Committee decided to promote rice transplanters even more extensively during the intermediate and late rice transplanting seasons. Therefore, in early April, a meeting of more than one hundred and twenty people from the Agricultural Machinery Bureau, the Science and Technology Commission, blacksmiths, carpenters, and technicians was held in Shuangqiao Commune, calling on everyone to contribute ideas and specifically study the performance and usage effects of various rice transplanters with different structures, paying particular attention to collecting a large number of opinions from rice transplanter operators, and conducting research, manufacturing, and experimentation simultaneously. After seven days, these collective experiences and wisdom gathered from the masses bore the fruitful results of the current 59-3 Wuming-style rice transplanter.

    Currently, more than one thousand blacksmiths and carpenters throughout Wuming County are working day and night to produce more "59-3 Wuming-style rice transplanters" before the intermediate and late rice transplanting season.

    坚决做新生事物的促进派
    广西武鸣县集中群众智慧改进插秧机
    本报讯　广西武鸣县坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把原来56—3型插秧机，改进成功性能更加良好的59—3型武鸣式插秧机，并在全县普遍推广，受到群众热烈欢迎。到6月1日，已出厂验收合格的二千八百五十六架插秧机，由六千多名插秧机手所组成的三百多个插秧机专业队操纵着，在中稻田间大显威风。
    武鸣县在早稻推广使用插秧机的时候，插秧机出现一些缺点，便有人议论纷纷。有说好的，也有说不好的，甚至个别人还攻击这是劳民伤财。但是，武鸣县委坚定不移地走群众路线，热情地对待新生事物，使这个初生婴孩——插秧机很快就成长壮大起来。中共武鸣县委在不断发动群众批判右倾思想，寻找缺点产生原因的同时并以双桥公社为重点，深入研究，派出“医疗队”到各地吸取经验教训。通过各种活动，互相启发，集体研究，做到上下相结合，铁木工、插秧机手和技术人员三结合，集中一切优点，逐步改进，插秧机性能一次比一次提高。3月初，全县在进行插秧机大评比中，发现两江公社和甘墟公社的两架插秧机的往复轮都放在中间，其它联系机件也作了相应的改进，比没有改进的机子优越得多。县农械局就加以总结提高，并先在双桥公社平稳大队制造一架使用，连续七天不用修理，证明改得合理，3月中旬就向全县推广，让它再回到群众中去考验。3月底，又发现马头公社奇泉大队一架机子的固定秧夹档片开了三角洞，结果秧夹没有带泥，分秧也比较均匀，县委马上指示加以研究改进提高，并布置县农具厂照样生产分配各地使用。经过这两次的局部改进，全面提高插秧机的思想就更加成熟了，来自下面的经验也更加多了。这时候早稻插秧已经结束，但县委决定在中、晚稻插秧中要更大量地推广插秧机，便于4月初旬在双桥公社召开农械局、科委、铁木工、技术人员等一百二十多人的会议，号召人人献计，具体研究各种不同构造的插秧机的性能和使用效果，特别注意了从插秧机手那里收集大量意见，边研究边制造边试验。经过七天的时间，这些集中起来的群众性的经验和智慧就结出了现在59—3型武鸣式插秧机的硕果。
    现在，武鸣县全县一千多铁木工人正在日夜赶制，保证在插中晚稻以前制造出更多的“59—3型武鸣式插秧机”。
