    Automatic Line Changes from Dedicated to Multi-Purpose

    Since the workers of the cutting tool workshop of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant successfully manufactured the city's first automated production line for hand taps in October last year, after more than five months of use and continuous improvement, they have not only improved the degree of automation, but also developed from "one line for dedicated use" to "one line for multiple uses." It can produce hand taps, as well as high-precision screws and general screws, fully exploring the potential of the automated production line.

    自动线专用变多用
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂刃具车间职工，自从去年十月份制造成功全市第一条手用丝锥自动化生产线以后，经过五个多月的使用和不断的改进，不仅提高了自动化程度，而且由“一线专用”发展为“一线多用”。它既能生产手用丝锥，又能生产高精度螺丝和一般螺丝，充分地挖掘了自动化生产线的潜力。
