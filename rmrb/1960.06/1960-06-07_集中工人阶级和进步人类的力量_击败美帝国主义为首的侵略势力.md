Xinhua News Agency, 6th June: Premier Zhou said at a banquet in honor of the delegates to the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting:
    Concentrate the Strength of the Working Class and Progressive Humanity
    Defeat the Aggressive Forces Headed by U.S. Imperialism
    Modern revisionists spread illusions of peace, blur the lines between friend and foe, and attempt to abolish revolutionary struggle. Their traitorous faces must be thoroughly exposed, their ideological toxins eliminated, and their sabotage activities crushed.

Premier Zhou Enlai said tonight to the trade union representatives from various countries who are attending the meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing that, in order to stop wars of aggression and safeguard world peace, it is necessary to rely on the people themselves to rise up and struggle against imperialism. In the face of powerful people's struggles, imperialism headed by the United States can be defeated.

Premier Zhou made these remarks at a banquet tonight in honor of the delegates attending the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The banquet was held in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People.

The atmosphere of friendship and solidarity prevailed at tonight's banquet. The Chinese hosts and trade union friends from 58 countries and regions across the five continents constantly raised their glasses to the great unity of the people of the world, to the victory of the cause of liberation of the working class of the world, to proletarian internationalist solidarity, and to world peace.

At 8:30 p.m., Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi, and others, along with World Federation of Trade Unions President Novella (Italy), Vice-Presidents Grishin (Soviet Union), Benoît Frachon (France), Vicente Lombardo Toledano (Mexico), Herbert Warnke (German Democratic Republic), Dange (India), František Zupka (Czechoslovakia), Loga-Sowiński (Poland), and Enrique Pastorino (Uruguay) entered the banquet hall. At this time, warm applause and welcoming music resounded in the hall.

Premier Zhou spoke at the beginning of the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed a warm welcome to the representatives of hundreds of millions of working-class brothers around the world. In warmly wishing the meeting success, he said that he believed that this meeting would have a positive effect on strengthening the international solidarity of the working class and on promoting the struggle of the working class of all countries against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace.

Premier Zhou said that the fundamental task facing the working class and progressive humanity of the world is to make full use of the current excellent situation, concentrate all forces, defeat the aggressive war forces headed by U.S. imperialism, continue to advance the cause of the people of all countries in striving for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism, and achieve the lofty goals of lasting peace and human progress.

Premier Zhou emphasized that begging imperialism for peace will never achieve peace. The aggressive and bellicose nature of imperialism cannot be changed, but as long as the people of the world wage a persistent struggle against it, imperialist wars and acts of aggression can be defeated.

He quoted Comrade Mao Zedong as saying that imperialism will always "make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until its extinction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will never go against this logic."

Premier Zhou said that the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the working class of all countries are the most reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace, the cause of liberation of the working class, and the cause of liberation of all oppressed nations. The most vicious and insidious trick of imperialism in undermining the unity of the working class of the world is to use modern revisionists who specialize in splitting the working class. Therefore, the working class of the world faces a serious combat task, which is to continue to thoroughly expose the traitorous faces of modern revisionists, thoroughly eliminate the ideological toxins they spread, and thoroughly smash all their destructive activities in splitting the working class.

Premier Zhou concluded by saying that the Chinese people will always be loyal to the cause of liberation of the working class of the world, loyal to the cause of liberation of all oppressed nations, and that the Chinese people will always stand on the same front with the people of all countries, encourage and support each other, and fight to the end against our common enemy.

Premier Zhou's speech won warm applause from the audience.

World Federation of Trade Unions President Novella said in his speech, "On behalf of all participants in the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I thank the Premier, the government, and all departments of the People's Republic of China for their warm and fraternal reception, and extend the warmest and most friendly greetings from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the millions of workers it represents to the workers of Beijing and all of China."

Speaking about the current situation, Novella said that U.S. imperialism, with its provocative and aggressive actions, persists in its Cold War and colonial policies. In order to continue this policy, it relies on all the most aggressive, most reactionary, and militaristic forces of world capitalism.

Novella emphasized that striving for the relaxation of the international situation, striving for disarmament, and striving for the establishment of lasting peace based on full respect for the sovereignty and national independence of all peoples remain today, and more than ever, the fundamental tasks of the international labor movement and the World Federation of Trade Unions. He said that we are discussing this task with great confidence.

Novella concluded by saying that the forces of peace and the forces of national independence of all countries are invincible. Through unity and struggle, they will find the path to victory throughout the world.

Peng Zhen and Lin Feng, vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Li Xiannian and Xi Zhongxun, vice-premiers of the State Council, and Liu Lantao, alternate secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were Liu Changsheng, Zhu Xuefan, and Li Jiebo, vice-chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as well as heads of various government departments, heads of democratic parties and people's organizations, heads of Beijing Municipality, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

During the banquet, Chinese artists performed excerpts from the famous Peking Opera "San Cha Kou" and the dance drama "The Little Knives Society," as well as the symphonic poem "Mu Guiying Takes Command," and other wonderful programs.

    周总理在招待世界工联理事会议代表的宴会上说
    集中工人阶级和进步人类的力量
    击败美帝国主义为首的侵略势力
    现代修正主义者散布和平幻想、模糊敌我界线，企图取消革命斗争。必须彻底揭穿他们的叛徒面目，消除思想毒素，粉碎他们的破坏活动。
    新华社6日讯　周恩来总理今晚对目前正在北京举行会议的世界各国的工会代表们说，要制止侵略战争，维护世界和平，必须依靠人民自己起来同帝国主义斗争，在强大的人民斗争面前，以美国为首的帝国主义是可以被战胜的。
    周总理是在今晚招待出席世界工会联合会第十一次理事会会议代表的宴会上讲这番话的。宴会是在人民大会堂宴会厅里举行。
    在今晚的宴会上，洋溢着友谊和团结的气氛。中国主人同来自五大洲的五十八个国家和地区的工会朋友们不断举杯，为全世界人民的伟大团结，为全世界工人阶级解放事业的胜利，为无产阶级国际主义团结，为世界和平干杯。
    八时半，周恩来总理、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一等和世界工联主席诺维拉（意大利），副主席格里申（苏联）、贝诺瓦·弗拉商（法国）、维森特·隆巴多·托列达诺（墨西哥）、赫伯特·瓦恩克（德意志民主共和国）、丹吉（印度）、弗朗齐歇克·苏普卡（捷克斯洛伐克）、洛加—索文斯基（波兰）、恩里克·帕斯塔里诺（乌拉圭）进入宴会厅。这时大厅里响起热烈的掌声和欢迎的乐曲声。
    周总理在宴会开始时讲话。他代表中国政府和中国人民向全世界亿万工人阶级兄弟的代表们表示热烈的欢迎。他在热情地预祝会议成功时说，相信这次会议对于加强工人阶级的国际团结，对于推动各国工人阶级反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争将发生积极的作用。
    周总理说，摆在世界工人阶级和进步人类面前的根本任务，就是要充分利用当前的大好形势，集中一切力量，击败以美帝国主义为首的战争侵略势力，继续推进各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的事业，实现持久和平和人类进步的崇高目的。
    周总理强调指出，向帝国主义乞求和平，是永远得不到和平的。帝国主义侵略和好战的本性是不可能改变的，但是只要全世界人民同它进行坚持不懈的斗争，帝国主义的战争和侵略活动是可以被击败的。
    他引用毛泽东同志的话说，帝国主义永远是“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    周总理说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，各国工人阶级的团结，是世界和平事业、工人阶级解放事业和一切被压迫民族解放事业的最可靠保障。帝国主义破坏世界工人阶级团结最毒辣最阴险的一手，就是利用现代修正主义者专门从事分裂工人阶级的活动。因此，世界工人阶级面临着一个严肃的战斗任务，就是要继续彻底揭穿现代修正主义者的叛徒面目，彻底消除他们所散布的思想毒素，彻底粉碎他们分裂工人阶级的一切破坏活动。
    周总理最后说，中国人民永远忠实于世界工人阶级的解放事业，忠实于一切被压迫民族的解放事业，中国人民将永远同各国人民站在一条战线上，互相鼓舞，互相支持，为反对我们的共同敌人斗争到底。
    周总理的讲话博得全场热烈的掌声。
    世界工联主席诺维拉在讲话中说，我以世界工联第十一次理事会全体参加者的名义感谢中华人民共和国总理、政府和各部门给予我们热烈的兄弟般的接待，并向北京和全中国的工人们致以世界工联和它所代表的千百万工人的最热烈和最友好的敬意。
    诺维拉在谈到当前形势时说，美帝国主义以挑衅和侵略行动，坚持冷战政策和殖民主义政策。为了能继续进行这种政策，它依靠着世界资本主义最具有侵略性、最反动和军国主义性的一切势力。
    诺维拉强调，争取国际局势缓和、争取裁军、争取建立在充分尊重各国人民的主权和民族独立基础上的持久和平，今天仍然是，并且比以往更加是国际工人运动和世界工联的根本任务。他说，我们正以巨大的信心讨论这项任务。
    诺维拉最后说，和平力量和各国人民的民族独立力量是不可战胜的。通过团结和斗争，它们将在全世界找到胜利的道路。
    人大常委会副委员长彭真、林枫，国务院副总理李先念、习仲勋，中共中央书记处候补书记刘澜涛出席了宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的还有中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜、朱学范、李颉伯，以及政府各部门负责人，各民主党派、人民团体负责人，北京市负责人和首都各界人士等。
