Xinhua News Agency Report: In Qinghai Province, hundreds of large and small reclamation areas distributed across grasslands, mountains, and plains are currently displaying a scene of joyful busyness. People of all ethnic groups are busy weeding, topdressing, watering, and preventing various natural disasters for the crops on the newly reclaimed land, striving for high yields and bumper harvests from all newly reclaimed areas.

Last winter and this spring, Qinghai Province newly reclaimed over seven million mu of land, and land reclamation, preparation, fertilizer production, and sowing were carried out in one go. As of mid-June, the area sown with spring wheat, highland barley, rapeseed, and other crops has doubled compared to last year.

After last autumn's harvest, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee further strengthened ideological education for people of all ethnic groups on the principle that the national economy should be based on agriculture and agricultural production should be based on grain. They formulated the policy of "focusing on large-scale land reclamation, expanding cultivated land area, and increasing yield per unit area simultaneously," launching a large-scale land reclamation and sowing campaign. Employees of state-owned farms and ranches, commune members of people's communes, and cadres of government agencies worked together, toiling through the winter and spring. In addition to sowing all the original cultivated land, they also reclaimed and planted over seven million mu, increasing the average cultivated land area per agricultural labor force by about eight mu, laying a reliable foundation for further agricultural development.

When the sowing was basically completed, people of all ethnic groups concentrated their main efforts on field management. Many people's communes put forward the slogan "New Land Catches Up with Mature Land," requiring that management measures for newly reclaimed land should match those for mature land. In order to manage the newly reclaimed land well and thoroughly, the broad masses of commune members went to the fields to set up camps. Rows of tents were pitched on many newly reclaimed lands, and some places even built earth houses, forming new villages.

Targeting the fact that newly reclaimed land has more weeds, poorer water conservancy facilities, and less base fertilizer, people of all ethnic groups are focusing on weeding during the current crop tillering and jointing period, combined with topdressing and watering. In the rush to weed, various localities have skillfully modified weeding tools, and have created and promoted a large number of new tools such as hollow hoes, double-headed hoes, single-wheel hand-pushed weeders, and tractor-drawn weeders, greatly improving weeding efficiency. In Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where newly reclaimed land accounts for two-thirds of the sown area, due to scarce rain and snow this spring, various communes and farms are focusing on water conservancy construction while weeding, making every effort to irrigate more fields. As a result of large-scale small-scale water conservancy projects in Gonghe County of this prefecture, the irrigated area has been expanded to 90% of the total sown area. In topdressing, localities are paying attention to applying phosphate and potash fertilizers based on the fact that newly reclaimed land soil contains more nitrogen but less phosphorus and potassium, ensuring the comprehensive needs of crops. The newly reclaimed land in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County is currently being topdressed with grass ash and soil fertilizer, with each mu of high-yield fields having been topdressed with more than 5,000 jin of fertilizer. Although the conditions for newly reclaimed land are worse than those for mature land, due to the above-mentioned series of management measures, the crops are generally growing better and better, the second and third-class seedlings are constantly upgraded, and the proportion of first-class seedlings is constantly increasing.

Since the vast majority of newly reclaimed land is located in mountainous and grassland areas, where climate change is greater, preventing natural disasters is an important measure to strive for a bumper harvest. In Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which has high altitudes and cold temperatures, commune members are building earthen stoves early, storing fuel, and preventing frost. Jiuzhi County of this prefecture has built more than 1,800 earthen stoves at the heads of fields in the newly reclaimed areas, established thousands of frost prevention points, and stored enough fuel, ready to fight against possible frost. In Minhe County, where the sown area has doubled, because hailstorms often occur in the mountainous areas during the height of summer, various communes have organized hail prevention joint defense organizations and have generally established hail prevention strongholds. Manping People's Commune has established more than 200 hail prevention points on various mountain tops, set up material piles and anti-hail cannons, and has more than 120 veteran farmers stationed at these points to observe the weather. Once hail clouds are detected, they use smoke and fire cannons for prevention. Since June, they have overcome two frosts and one hailstorm.

### 锄尽杂草追施细肥　及时浇水  青海要新垦地赶上熟地

    锄尽杂草追施细肥　及时浇水
    青海要新垦地赶上熟地
    据新华社讯　分布在青海省草原、山区、平川的几百个大小垦区，目前呈现出一派欢乐繁忙的景象。各族人民正在忙着给新垦地上的庄稼除草、追肥、浇水和防止各种自然灾害，力争全部新垦地高产多收。
    去冬今春，青海省新开荒地七百多万亩，而且开荒、整地、造肥、播种一气呵成，截至6月中旬止，已经播种的春小麦、青稞、油菜等作物，面积比去年扩大一倍。
    中共青海省委在去年秋收以后，就进一步加强对各族人民进行国民经济以农业为基础，农业生产以粮食为纲的思想教育，制定了“以大量开荒为主、扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量并举”的方针，掀起了规模壮阔的开荒、播种运动。全省国营农牧场职工、人民公社社员和机关干部三支大军齐发，大干了一冬一春，除全部播种原有耕地以外，又边开垦边种了七百多万亩，使全省每个农牧业劳动力平均增加了耕地八亩左右，为进一步发展农业奠定了可靠基础。
    当播种基本结束时，各族人民就集中主要力量投入田间管理。许多人民公社提出了“新地赶熟地”的行动口号，要求新垦地的管理措施向熟地看齐。广大社员为了把新垦地管好、管到底，纷纷到地头安营下寨。许多新垦地上扎起了一排排的帐篷，有的地方还盖了土房，形成了新的村落。
    各族人民针对新垦地杂草较多、水利设施较差、基肥较少的情况，在当前庄稼分蘖拔节期间都以除草为中心，结合进行追肥和浇水。在突击除草中，各地巧改除草工具，大量创制和推广了空心锄、双头锄、单轮手推式除草器、牵引式除草器等多种新式工具，使除草效率大大提高。新垦地占到播种面积三分之二的海南藏族自治州，由于今春雨雪稀少，各公社和农场在除草的同时大抓水利建设，尽一切可能使更多田地能够浇上水。这个州的共和县大修小型水利的结果，已使水地扩大到总播种面积的90％。在追肥中，各地根据新垦地土壤含氮较多，含磷含钾较少的情况，注意追施磷肥、钾肥，保证庄稼全面的需要。门源回族自治县的新垦地目前都在追施草木灰和土化肥，丰产田每亩已追施肥料五千斤以上。新垦地虽比熟地条件差，但由于进行了上述一系列的管理，庄稼普遍越长越好，二、三类苗不断升级，一类苗比例不断增大。
    由于绝大部分新垦地位于山区和草原，气候变化较大，防止自然灾害是争取丰收的一项重要措施。地势高寒的果洛藏族自治州，社员们及早修筑土炉，储备燃料，预防霜冻。这个州的久治县已经在新垦区的田头修筑了一千八百多座土炉，建立了千百处防霜点，并储足了燃料，随时准备迎击可能发生的霜冻。播种面积扩大一倍的民和县，因为山区在盛夏期间常有冰雹为害，各公社已经组织了冰雹联防机构，普遍建立了防雹据点。满坪人民公社在各个山头建立两百多个防雹点，设置了料堆和防雹火炮，由一百二十多位老农驻点观察天气，一发现雹云就熏烟放炮预防。6月以来，他们已经战胜了两次霜冻和一次冰雹。
