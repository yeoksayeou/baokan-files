    Vow to Make U.S. Imperialists Pay Their Blood Debt
    Lin Zhen'ai, Head of the 14th Work Team, "August 15th" Agricultural Cooperative, An'yue County, Huanghai South Province, Korea

    Our cooperative's crops are bountiful every year. New houses have been built in the places that were reduced to ruins by the massive bombings of American planes. Tractors and cars race across our collectivized fields. We have completely healed the wounds of war, and our lives have completely changed.

    When people who have suffered so much live a good life, they recall the past even more profoundly. When we and the people in our village look at our current happy lives, we cannot help but feel extreme anger towards the American imperialist aggressors who brought us countless pain and misfortune. American imperialism is a devil in human skin, a heinous enemy that humanity cannot live under the same sky with.

    In October 1950, the American imperialist aggressors who invaded my hometown—Zhongcun (now An'yue Township), An'yue County, Huanghai South Province—seized sixty-three men, women, and children from a village of only forty households and buried them alive under the cliffs of Futan Cave. They also threw many people into the Zaining River. My parents and three older brothers were slaughtered by those vicious bandits at that time.

    The American devils, who inhumanly murdered my father, a true and honest old farmer, broke into my house in the middle of the night and used knives and guns to force away my mother, who was carrying my three-year-old younger brother on her back, and my twin older brothers. I was only fourteen years old at the time, and I naively thought: my mother and older brothers will come back in a few days.

    My younger sister, Zhennü, and younger brother, Zhenjun, looked for their mother every night, and I hugged them tightly and said, mother and older brothers will be back after one night. But day after day passed, and mother did not return.

    When our People's Army and the valiant brotherly Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors defeated the American imperialist aggressors and liberated our village, I went with the people in the village to Futan Cave to dig out sixty-three corpses, and found our family among them: a mother tightly holding her child, a young brother with his mouth full of dirt, and two older brothers hugging each other tightly.

    As long as American imperialism is entrenched in South Korea, as long as there is imperialism in the world, the various inhuman atrocities of imperialism against innocent people will not be eliminated.

    The armistice has been in place for seven years. I, an ignorant girl, have grown up in the embrace of the Party to become the head of the agricultural production team of the agricultural cooperative. My younger sister and brother are also studying in middle school and primary school, respectively. Our rural areas have completed socialist collectivization, and both paddy and dry fields are irrigated. Agricultural mechanization will be completed in one or two years, and people are living a prosperous new life in new houses.

    People often say that with time, the past will be forgotten. But the older I get, the more I understand, the more I cannot forget the great pain that I and our people have suffered, and the more I cannot suppress my anger towards the mortal enemy—American imperialists. Since ancient times, there has been a saying: treat friends with warmth and hospitality, and demand a blood debt from enemies. I must avenge my family. I must demand a blood debt from the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, and I must realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    In order to prevent the head of world imperialism—the American imperialists—from repeating the heinous deeds of June 25th, and in order not to bring such days to the lives of billions of people around the world, I will do my best to complete my task of increasing grain production. The Party tells us that the more consolidated the democratic base in the northern part of the Republic is, the sooner the peaceful reunification of the fatherland can be realized.

    The common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, the enemy of peace—American imperialism—must be driven out forever from South Korea, from Taiwan, and from all over the world.

### 誓要美帝国主义者偿还血债

    誓要美帝国主义者偿还血债
    朝鲜黄海南道安岳郡“八·一五”农业社
      第十四作业班班长  林贞爱
    我们社的庄稼年年丰收。在美国飞机大肆轰炸下成了废墟的地方，盖起了一排排的新房子。拖拉机和汽车奔驰在我们合作化后的田野上。我们已经完全医好了战争创伤，我们的生活也完全变了样。
    受尽苦难的人们过着好日子，就更深刻地回忆起过去的经历。我和我们村里的人们看看现在的幸福生活，就不由地对给我们带来了数不清的痛苦和惨祸的美帝国主义侵略者表示极大的愤怒。美帝国主义是披着人皮的魔鬼，是人类不共戴天的凶恶的敌人。
    1950年10月，侵略我的家乡——黄海南道安岳郡中村（现在的安岳邑）的美帝国主义侵略者，在仅有四十户人家的村庄中抓去了六十三名男女老少居民，在佛坛洞峭地下活埋了。他们还把很多人投进了载宁江里。我的父母和三个哥哥就是那时被凶恶的强盗屠杀的。
    惨无人道地屠杀了道地的老农民——我的父亲的美国鬼子，又在半夜闯进了我家，用刀枪逼着抓走了背着三岁的弟弟的我的母亲和双胞胎的哥哥，当时我只有十四岁，还天真地想：过几天母亲和哥哥会回来。
    年幼的妹妹贞女和弟弟贞俊每晚都找妈妈，我就紧紧地抱住他们说，过一夜妈妈和哥哥就回来。可是，过了一天又一天，妈妈也不回来。
    我们的人民军和英勇的兄弟般的中国志愿军勇士们击溃了美帝国主义侵略者解放了我们村庄时，我才同村里的人们一道到佛坛洞峭地下挖出了六十三具尸体，从中找到了我们家里的人。牢牢地紧抱着孩子的母亲、满嘴泥土的年幼的弟弟和紧紧抱在一起的两个哥哥。
    只要美帝国主义盘据在南朝鲜，世界上只要有帝国主义，就不会消除帝国主义对无辜人民的各种非人道的暴行。
    停战已经整整七年了。我这一个无知的少女已经在党的怀抱里成长为农业社农产作业班班长。妹妹和弟弟也分别在中学和小学念书。我们的农村已完成了社会主义的合作化，水旱田都实行了灌溉。在一两年内就能完成农业机械化，人们在新住宅里过着富裕的新生活。
    人们常说，时间长了就会忘记过去的事。但是，我的年纪越大，越懂道理，就越不能忘记我和我们的人民经受的巨大的痛苦，也越压不住对不共戴天的敌人——美帝国主义者的愤怒。自古以来有这样一句话：对朋友要热情款待，对敌人要讨还血债。我一定要为我们家里的人报仇。一定要向朝鲜人民和中国人民的共同敌人讨还血债，一定要实现祖国的和平统一。
    为了使世界帝国主义的头子——美帝国主义者不再重演6月25日的可恶勾当，为了不给全世界亿万人民的生活带来这样的日子，我要全力完成我的增产粮食的任务。党告诉我们，共和国北部的民主基地越巩固，祖国的和平统一就能尽早实现。
    必须从南朝鲜、从台湾、从世界各地永远赶走朝中两国人民的共同的敌人、和平的敌人——美帝国主义。
