　　The God of Plague crosses the street nine times, always with protection
　　A United Press International reporter, Smith, traveling with the U.S. President, said that when Eisenhower appeared in public processions in South Korea, "a U.S. helicopter always hung overhead with a two-hundred-foot-long ladder and a special device to rescue the President from the crowd in case of trouble." The plane buzzes loudly overhead, the ladder sways in the wind, protected from all five sides, the President greases his soles, at the slightest sign of trouble, he slips into the sky at any moment, out of the siege and loses face, but cares for his life and has no time to care about shame.

    瘟神过街九，随时保驾
    随同美国总统旅行的合众国际社记者史密斯说，艾森豪威尔在南朝鲜的公开行列中出现的时候，“头上一直有一架美国直升飞机挂着二百英尺长的吊梯和一个特别的装置，以便在发生麻烦时把总统从群众中救出来”。飞机当头响嗡嗡，吊梯随风晃悠悠，上下五面保了险，总统脚底抹了油，一遇风吹和草动，随时就往天上溜，出了重围丢了脸，顾得性命顾不得羞。东方剑诗　蓝建安画（附图片）
