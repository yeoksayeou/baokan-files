    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: Liberal Democratic Party Diet Member Otani Eijun, a person of standing within the Liberal Democratic Party leadership, announced his withdrawal from the Liberal Democratic Party today in opposition to the new "Security Treaty".

    Otani released a statement saying that he firmly opposes the conclusion of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and therefore cannot support the party's decision.

    Otani is one of the most influential leaders of the Shinshu sect in the Japanese Buddhist world, and is also the chairman of the Committee for Comforting the Spirits of Martyred Chinese Soldiers. Otani condemned the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" for violating Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which stipulates that Japan renounces war. He emphasized, "Japan should not take any action that could involve it in war. Japan should not sacrifice itself to be cannon fodder." He said, "Japanese politicians have a responsibility to provide future generations with every possible measure to prevent them from suffering the dangers of war. Therefore, Japan should not agree to take joint action with foreign countries in the event of war."

    The news says that Otani's statement has caused a sensation in Japanese political and Buddhist circles. Many people visited him or called him to express their support for his actions.

    反对卖国的新“安全条约”
    日执政党参议员大谷退党
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：在日本自由民主党领导机构中有地位的参议员大谷莹润，今天为反对新“安全条约”宣布退出自由民主党。
    大谷发表声明说，他坚决反对缔结新日美“安全条约”，因此他不能支持这个党的决定。
    大谷是日本佛教界中最有势力的一派真宗派的领袖之一，同时是中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会的委员长。大谷谴责新日美“安全条约”违反规定日本放弃战争的日本宪法第九条。他强调说，“日本不应当采取可能把日本卷入战争的任何行动。日本不应当牺牲自己去当炮灰。”他说，“日本政治家有责任给后代提供一切可能的措施，使他们可以不遭受战争的危险。因此日本不应当答应在发生战争时使它不得不同外国采取共同行动。”
    消息说，大谷发表的这项声明，在日本的政界和佛教界中引起了轰动。许多人去访问他或者打电话给他，表示支持他的行动。
