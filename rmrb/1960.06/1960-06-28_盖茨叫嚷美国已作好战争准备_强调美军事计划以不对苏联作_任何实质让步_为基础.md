Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 27th: U.S. Defense Secretary Gates once again made warlike clamors in a television speech on the 26th. He yelled that the United States was "ready for combat" to conduct small-scale wars and world wars.

Gates emphasized that the U.S. military plan was drafted on the basis of making "no substantial concessions" to the Soviet Union.

Gates advocated increasing military appropriations to build new aircraft carriers and "Bomarc" surface-to-air missiles.

Gates demanded continued support for reactionary regimes of satellite countries with massive military "aid." He emphasized that America's "entire strategy is based on our collective security arrangements" and that U.S. foreign "aid" programs are an "absolutely integral part" of America's "defense."
