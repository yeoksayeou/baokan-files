Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 16th: News from Manila:

    U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to the Philippines has ended, and he issued today a joint communiqué in Manila on the results of his talks with Philippine President Garcia. This communiqué, full of the smell of gunpowder, fully demonstrates the purpose of Eisenhower's Far East trip to plan aggressive conspiracies, and smashes the false cloak of peace that he attempted to mend.

    The joint communiqué begins aggressively, saying that the two sides "discussed the possibility of increased tensions due to recent remarks by Moscow and Peking (Beijing) Communist leaders" and "assessed the continued threat posed by Communist China to peace in the Far East." The joint communiqué stated that "they reaffirmed the importance of regional cooperation (i.e., piecing together regional aggressive blocs)" and "emphasized the important role of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in promoting such cooperation and promoting a sense of regional unity."

    The communiqué emphasized "the importance of close military cooperation and joint planning between the relevant authorities of the United States and the Philippines," and said that this "close military cooperation and planning should aim at the most effective formulation and implementation of the U.S. (to the Philippines) military assistance program, and further strengthen the Philippines' defense capabilities in accordance with modern needs."

    The communiqué expressed satisfaction with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting recently held in Washington, which plotted new aggressive conspiracies in the Far East, saying that this group "remains a deterrent (force) to Communist aggression (activities) in Southeast Asia."

    The communiqué said that both parties "reviewed the provisions of the (U.S.-Philippine) Mutual Defense Treaty," and "Eisenhower reaffirmed the assurance he made to Garcia in Washington that, in accordance with the terms of this treaty and other defense agreements between the two countries, and in accordance with deployments and configurations made under these provisions, any armed attack on the Philippines would be an attack on U.S. forces stationed there and on the United States."

    At the same time, when the communiqué referred to the disputes between the two countries caused by the establishment of military bases by the United States in the Philippines, it only said vaguely that it hoped to achieve a "solution satisfactory to both governments."

    The communiqué declared that the United States would continue to "aid" the Philippines in developing its economy, but the communiqué showed that Eisenhower made no commitments in this regard. The communiqué only stated that they "discussed the possibility of increasing (U.S. to the Philippines) private investment and expanding trade between the two countries under conditions conducive to free enterprise and the free flow of capital."

    According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty, Eisenhower is scheduled to leave the Philippines tonight and arrive in Taiwan tomorrow morning to carry out his provocative activities hostile to the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 16th: News from Manila: Eisenhower, in a speech at a joint session of the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives on the 15th, reiterated that the United States insists on implementing the policy of "strength." He said that in order to maintain the position of the United States, "the United States must remain strong."

    He bluntly supported the Philippine government's "initiative in strengthening ties with its neighbors." Eisenhower said that the United States advocates expanding relations between countries, "in addition to the guarantee of U.S. strength, we also seek to expand collective security."

    As everyone knows, Philippine President Garcia just visited Taiwan in early June and openly declared that if the Chiang Kai-shek clique applies to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Philippines will definitely support it.

    In order to conceal the aggressive essence of U.S. policy, Eisenhower tried his best to dress himself up as a fighter against colonialism. He actually said, "The banner of freedom and just nationalism is" what "we (the United States) fought for when we fought for our own freedom in 1776, and we must still fight for it in 1960."

    Eisenhower's speech shows that he is trying his best to win over nationalist forces. He stated that he recognized nationalism as "a powerful force," and that "no collusion of forces, no coercion of weapons can suppress nationalism forever." He emphasized that the United States is opposed to colonialism. At the same time, he babbled about the need for "positive nationalism," clamoring not to "cultivate" nationalist sentiments "to the extent that the people of a country forget that they are part of the human family."

Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 16th: News from Manila: According to United Press International on the 15th, quoting U.S. officials, Eisenhower, in talks with Philippine President Garcia, has agreed to consider the possibility of providing the Philippines with more modern weapons (including missiles).

    Garcia said at a press conference on the evening of the 15th that he had asked Eisenhower for "defensive nuclear missiles" to increase the Philippines' military strength.

    头号战争贩子远东之行的侵略阴谋毕露
    美菲联合公报充满火药味
    艾森豪威尔在菲国会叫嚣坚持“实力”政策
    新华社16日讯　马尼拉消息：
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在菲律宾的访问已经结束，今天在当地发表了他同菲律宾总统加西亚会谈结果的联合公报。这份充满火药味的公报，充分说明了艾森豪威尔这次远东之行策划侵略阴谋的目的，并且把他企图补缀的假和平外衣撕得粉碎。
    联合公报一开始就杀气腾腾地说，会谈双方“讨论了紧张局势由于莫斯科和北平（京）共产党领导人最近发表的言论而加剧的可能性”，“估计了共产党中国对远东和平构成的持续的威胁”。联合公报说，“他们重申区域合作（即拼凑地区性的侵略集团）的重要性”，并且“强调东南亚条约组织在促进这种合作和促进区域团结感方面的重要作用”。
    公报强调美菲“两国有关当局之间在军事上密切合作和共同进行计划工作的重要性”，并且说，这种“密切的军事合作和计划，目的应该是在于最有效地制定和执行美国（对菲律宾）的军事援助计划，和根据现代的需要进一步加强菲律宾的防务能力”。
    公报对最近在华盛顿举行的、策划在远东的新侵略阴谋的东南亚集团理事会会议表示满意，它说什么这个集团“仍然是对共产党在东南亚的侵略（活动）的阻遏（力量）”。
    公报说，双方“回顾了（美菲）共同防务条约的条款”，“艾森豪威尔重申了他在华盛顿曾经向加西亚作出的保证，即根据这一条约和两国间其他防务协定的条款，和依照在这些规定下进行的部署和配置，对菲律宾的任何武装攻击都会是对驻在那里的美国军队和对美国的攻击”。
    同时，公报在谈到因为美国在菲律宾设立军事基地而引起的两国间的纠纷时，只是空洞地说希望取得“使两国政府都感到满意的解决”。
    公报扬言美国将继续“援助”菲律宾发展经济，但是公报表明，艾森豪威尔在这方面未作任何承诺。公报只是说，他们“讨论了增加（美国对菲律宾的）私人投资和在有利于自由企业和资本自由流动的情况下，扩大两国贸易的可能性”。
    据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂宣布，艾森豪威尔定今晚离开菲律宾，明早到达台湾进行他敌视中国人民的挑衅活动。
    新华社16日讯　马尼拉消息：艾森豪威尔15日在菲律宾参议院和众议院联席会议的一次讲话中，重申美国坚持执行“实力地位”的政策。他说，为了维持美国的立场，
  “美国必须保持强大。”
    他露骨地支持菲律宾政府“在加强同它的邻国的联系方面采取的主动”。艾森豪威尔说，美国主张扩大各国之间的关系，“除了美国的实力的保障以外，我们还设法扩大集体安全”。
    大家知道，菲律宾总统加西亚在6月上旬刚刚去过台湾，并且公然宣称如果蒋介石集团申请加入东南亚条约组织，菲律宾一定予以支持。
    为了掩盖美国政策的侵略实质，艾森豪威尔竭力把自己打扮成反殖民主义的斗士。他竟然说，“自由和正当的民族主义的旗帜是“我们（美国）在1776年为自己的自由而斗争的时候为之奋斗的，我们在1960年仍然要为之奋斗”。
    艾森豪威尔的讲话表明他竭力打算笼络民族主义力量。他表示，他承认民族主义是“一股强大的力量”，“任何力量的勾结、任何武器的胁迫都不能永远压制民族主义”。他强调美国是反对殖民主义的。同时他又胡诌什么要有“积极的民族主义”，叫嚷不要把民族主义的情绪“培养到一个国家的人民忘记了他们是人类大家庭的组成部分的程度”。
    新华社16日讯　马尼拉消息：据合众国际社15日引用美国官员的话说，艾森豪威尔在同菲律宾总统加西亚会谈中，已经答应考虑给菲律宾提供更多的现代武器（其中包括导弹）的可能性。
    加西亚15日晚上在记者招待会上说，他已经向艾森豪威尔要求“防御性的核导弹”来增加菲律宾的军事力量。
