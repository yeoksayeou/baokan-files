Xinhua News Agency, 10th June. Today, representatives from the archives work system attending the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education gathered to exchange advanced experiences and listen to a speech by Zeng San, Director of the National Archives Bureau.

In his speech, Zeng San pointed out that China's archives undertaking has developed vigorously over the past decade, making significant achievements in serving China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. At present, 1,581 county-level archives, 106 special district archives, 16 provincial (municipal, autonomous region) archives, and 2 central archives have been established nationwide. Some specialized archives are also under preparation.

Zeng San said that China's archives undertaking, like other cultural undertakings, serves proletarian politics. Therefore, it has played a certain role in the comprehensive, continuous, and great leap forward in socialist construction over the past year. For example, the compilation of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong this year and the writing of historical materials for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country in 1959 fully utilized the archival materials preserved in archives (offices) at all levels. Many industrial construction departments have utilized geological, hydrological, meteorological, and other archival materials and design drawings preserved in archives during capital construction, saving time in surveying, designing, and construction. In terms of serving cultural construction, the writing and filming of movies such as "The Party's Daughter," "Red Children," and "Song Jing Shi" also utilized archival materials preserved in archives. In addition, archives have done a lot of work in providing materials for educational departments to compile local textbooks, for scientific research, and for compiling history and local chronicles. Zeng San then put forward opinions on how to do a good job in the current archives work based on the spirit of this National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education. He asked the archives to find ways to further improve the level of work in all aspects, strengthen scientific and technological archives work, and carry out more work in the education of archives work and the theoretical construction of archives work.

At today's meeting, Liang Tiancai from Xichuan County, Henan Province, Lin Zhengqian from Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, Xia Zhenzhang from Hengshan County, Hunan Province, Meng Zhao'e from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Cheng Changli from Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, Yue Shoulin from Hua County, Henan Province, Wang Qingfeng from State-owned Huifeng Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province, Zhang Wanqi from Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, Zhang Dechao from Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, and Han Hude from Xingning County, Guangdong Province, introduced the achievements and experiences of local archives work.

In the speeches of the representatives, it was more specifically shown that the archives workers in various places, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, were making every effort to build the archives undertaking and serve the current socialist politics and economy. Liang Tiancai from Henan Province introduced that the Xichuan County Archives had provided nearly 20,000 pieces of archival materials for various tasks since last year. During the county's water conservancy movement, they compiled "Collection of Rivers and Springs in Xichuan County." During the busy wheat field management work this spring, they searched and compiled materials such as "Methods for Preventing Wheat Lodging" and "Vigorously Promote High-Yield Plots," which were welcomed by grassroots cadres. Lin Zhengqian from Fujian Province said that the "Basic Knowledge Reference Manual for Industrial and Agricultural Production" compiled by the Zhao'an County Archives was regarded as a "treasure" by rural cadres. This archive began to cooperate with relevant agencies in the county in March this year to carry out the writing of "Four Histories" (county chronicles, commune history, commune brigade history, and agency history) throughout the county. Now it has completed nearly 300,000 words of the county chronicles' first draft, and three-quarters of the communes have written their commune histories. Cheng Changli from Anhui Province introduced how the Jinzhai County Archives took the mass line in its work. Xia Zhenzhang from Hunan Province also talked about the experience of archives storage work and vigorously carrying out tool reforms to improve work efficiency in his speech.

The meeting will continue tomorrow morning.

    千方百计为当前斗争服务
    档案工作系统会议今天举行
    新华社10日讯　今天，出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的档案工作系统代表集会，交流先进经验，并听取了国家档案局局长曾三的讲话。
    曾三在讲话中指出，我国档案馆事业十年来已经取得蓬勃发展，为我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务方面，作出了显著的成绩。目前，全国已建立县档案馆一千五百八十一个，专区档案馆一百零六个，省（市、自治区）档案馆十六个，中央档案馆二个，还有一些专门性的档案馆在筹建中。
    曾三说，我国的档案馆事业，正如同其他文化事业一样，它是为无产阶级政治服务的。因而一年来，在社会主义建设全面连续大跃进中发挥了一定的作用。例如今年编辑毛泽东选集和1959年编写建国十周年史料，都充分利用了各级档案馆（室）所保存的档案材料。许多工业建设部门在进行基本建设时，都利用了档案馆保存的地质、水文、气象等方面的档案资料和设计图纸，节省了勘查、设计和施工时间。在为文化建设服务方面，如“党的女儿”、“红孩子”和“宋景诗”等电影的编写、拍摄也都利用了档案馆保存的档案资料。此外，档案馆在为教育部门供应编写地方教材的素材、为科学研究、为编史修志服务等方面也做了很多工作。曾三接着根据这次全国文教先进工作者代表大会的精神，对如何做好目前档案工作提出了意见。他要求档案馆从各方面设法进一步提高工作水平；加强科学技术档案工作；在档案工作的教育方面和档案工作的理论建设方面也要展开更多的工作。
    今天的会上，河南省淅川县的梁天才、福建省诏安县的林镇乾、湖南省衡山县的夏振璋、内蒙古自治区的孟昭鄂、安徽省金寨县的程长里、河南省滑县的岳守林、山西省国营惠丰机械厂的王庆丰、吉林省蛟河县张万起、安徽省全椒县章德超、广东省兴宁县韩湖德等代表先后介绍当地档案馆工作的成绩和经验。
    在代表们的发言中，更具体地显示出各地档案工作者在各级党委的领导下，千方百计地建设档案事业，为当前社会主义政治、经济服务。河南省梁天才介绍淅川县档案馆去年以来为各项工作提供了近两万件档案资料。在全县水利化运动中，编写了“淅川县河流泉汇集”，在今春麦田管理工作繁忙时，搜编了“小麦防倒伏的方法”、“大搞丰产方”等资料，都受到基层干部的欢迎。福建省林镇乾说，诏安县档案馆所编的“工农业生产基本知识参考手册”被农村干部看成是“随身宝”，这个馆于今年3月份开始，在县的有关机关配合下开展了全县范围的编写“四史”（县志、公社史、公社大队史、机关史）工作，现在已经完成了近三十万字的县志初稿，有四分之三的公社写出了公社史。安徽省程长里介绍了金寨县档案馆在工作中如何走群众路线的做法；湖南省夏振璋发言中还谈到了档案的保管工作和大闹工具改革，提高工作效率等经验。
    会议将于明天上午继续进行。
