These enterprises pointed out in their pledges that the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy and its principles in the struggle against the aggressive activities of American warmongers inspire the working people of Moscow to work more effectively to strengthen the country's strength. In order to welcome the July Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, in addition to expressing their desire to complete the first half-year production plan ahead of schedule and increase labor productivity, all enterprises have proposed to complete the task of mechanization and automation of the production process in the shortest possible time. For example, in order to realize the comprehensive mechanization of the factory, the "Red Proletarian" machine tool factory will mechanize the various sections of the assembly workshop before the July Plenum is held. The Red October Confectionery Factory will put the first automated sugar production line in the country's confectionery industry into production ahead of schedule, which will increase labor productivity by 15%.

　　Workers and staff of industrial, construction, scientific research and design institutions in Leningrad City and Oblast recently expressed their unanimous support for the Soviet government's position in Paris in a letter to the CPSU Central Committee and the government. It was pointed out that this position once again demonstrated the Soviet people's determination to retaliate against any aggressor. The letter put forward a guarantee to welcome the Plenum, saying that enterprises in Leningrad City and Oblast will complete the first half-year production plan on June 24; complete the annual production plan on December 24; will overproduce various machines and automation equipment worth 150 million rubles on the basis of the original guarantee, and greatly improve product quality.

In a letter to the Party Central Committee and the government, the workers and staff who participated in the meeting said that in order to counter the aggression of American warmongers, the working people of the Central Urals will work harder to enhance the strength and defense of the motherland. They will reach the level of the total output value of the Seven-Year Plan in five years without increasing basic investment. The letter also put forward a guarantee that the province's industry, transportation, and construction industries will complete the first half-year and annual plans ahead of schedule, respectively.

    创造出色的劳动成就来增强祖国威力
    苏联劳动人民准备回击美国侵略
    斯维德洛夫斯克和基米罗伏州一百五十万人分别集会支持政府严正立场
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联全国各工矿企业的职工纷纷举行了会议，表示为了增强祖国的威力，打击帝国主义者的无耻挑衅行动，一定要把争取提前完成七年计划的竞赛推向新的高潮，用更加出色的劳动成就迎接苏共中央七月全会。
    在首都莫斯科，有数十个大型企业最近在“莫斯科真理报”上联合发表了它们迎接苏共中央全会的保证。这些企业保证中指出，苏联一贯的和平对外政策以及它在反对美国黩武主义者侵略活动斗争中的原则，激发着莫斯科的劳动人民为加强祖国的实力进行更有成效的劳动。为了迎接苏共中央七月全会，各企业除表示要提前完成前半年的生产计划和提高劳动生产率的任务外，都提出要在最短的时期内完成生产过程机械化和自动化的任务。例如，“红色无产者”工作母机制造厂为了实现工厂的综合机械化，要在七月全会召开前使装配车间各工段机械化。红十月糖果厂将提前把全国糖果工业中第一条自动化制糖作业线投入生产，这将提高劳动生产率15％。
    列宁格勒市和州的工业、建筑业和科学研究设计机关的职工最近在给苏共中央和政府的一封信中，一致表示支持苏联政府在巴黎采取的立场。指出这一立场再次显示了苏联人民准备给任何侵略者以回击的决心。信中提出迎接全会的保证说，列宁格勒市和州的企业将在6月24日完成前半年生产计划；在12月24日完成全年生产计划；将在原来保证的基础上再超额生产价值一亿五千万卢布的各种机器和自动化设备，并且大大提高产品质量。
    斯维德洛夫斯克州的各工矿企业和科学设计机关的职工也都举行了集会，参加的人数达九十万人。参加会议的职工在给党中央和政府的信中说，为了回击美国黩武主义者的侵略，中乌拉尔的劳动人民将更加努力增强祖国的实力和国防。他们将在不增加基本投资的情况下，用五年的时间达到七年计划总产值的水平。信中还提出了全州的工业、运输业和建筑业将分别提前完成前半年和全年计划的保证。
    基米罗伏州的工矿企业在最近举行了共有六十万职工参加的会议。苏联其他州和各大城市的职工也举行了会议。这些地方劳动人民也都表示要用更加忘我的劳动争取提前完成七年计划来迎接苏共中央七月全会的召开，并以此来回击和平敌人的侵略活动。
