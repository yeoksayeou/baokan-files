Grasping with both hands as a leadership method has been proven by many places and enterprises to be a good way to promote a sustained and substantial increase in production. A current example is the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory. Because this factory implemented grasping with both hands, it not only exceeded its production plan every month, but also ensured a balance between work and rest, and did a good job in the cultural and technical education of its employees.

The so-called grasping with both hands means grasping comprehensively. All aspects of anything are interconnected and influence and restrict each other. Modern enterprise production is even more so. If we only grasp one aspect and not the other, there will be loopholes, the various links will not be adapted to each other, and production will not increase, or will not be able to rise continuously. For example, production and production preparation, production and life are interconnected and mutually promote each other. If we grasp with both hands, we can maintain and strengthen this connection and promote the continuous development of production. If we only grasp with one hand, then the internal connection of things will be destroyed, the opposites will not be unified, and of course, it will affect production.

The principle and benefits of grasping with both hands are now understood by everyone. The question is how to implement grasping with both hands. The experience of many enterprises has proved that to do a good job in grasping with both hands, one must grasp specifically and practically. There are roughly two aspects to specific grasping. First, make specific arrangements for grasping with both hands. Modern enterprise production is mostly continuous and complex. Without specific arrangements, grasping with both hands may fall through. In this regard, many enterprises have some successful experiences, such as focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month, focusing on preparation in the last ten days, and the leaders of production organizations at all levels having specific divisions of labor, with some specializing in production and others specializing in preparation, etc. These methods are all very good, but having specific arrangements does not mean that grasping with both hands has been done well. A more important aspect is whether the leaders frequently go deep into the front line of production to discover and solve specific problems in grasping with both hands. Because whether it is production and preparation, or production and life, the standard of whether it is grasped well lies in whether problems are solved. If enterprise leaders only sit in the office and grasp with both hands, it is not easy to grasp the specific key points in the work, just like looking at the peaks of the mountains from a distance, you can only see the outline, and you cannot clearly see the specific image of the flowers, plants and trees on the mountain, so it is not easy to grasp well. To grasp production, you must go to the workshops, sections, and groups; to grasp life, you must go to the canteens, dormitories, and nurseries; this makes it easier to discover problems. Problems that used to require "passing five checkpoints" to solve can now be solved by passing one checkpoint. Therefore, specific grasping is the guarantee for doing a good job in grasping with both hands.

Now, large numbers of enterprise leading cadres have gone to the front line to set up camp, which has created a more favorable situation and conditions for grasping with both hands. If we both learn to grasp with both hands and can grasp deeply, practically, and specifically, then the foundation of our leadership work will be stronger and more powerful, and we will definitely be able to increase production even more in the third quarter on the basis of increased production in the second quarter.

### 两手抓和具体抓

    两手抓和具体抓
    陈之衍
    两手抓的领导方法，已经被许多地方许多企业证明是促进生产持续大幅度上升的好方法。眼前的一例是兰州水泵厂。这个厂由于实行了两手抓，不仅做到生产月月超额完成计划，而且有劳有逸，职工的文化技术教育也搞得好。
    所谓两手抓，也就是全面抓。任何事物的各方面都存在着一定的联系，彼此影响着，制约着，现代企业的生产更是这样，如果只抓其一，不抓其二，出了漏洞，各环节之间就不相适应，生产就上不去，或者不能持续地上升。比如生产和生产的准备工作、生产和生活都是相互联系相互促进的，如果我们两手抓，就能保持和加强这种联系，促进生产不断发展。如果我们只是一手抓，那末事物内部的联系受到破坏，对立面就得不到统一，当然就要影响生产。
    两手抓的道理和好处，现在大家都是明白的。问题是怎样实行两手抓。许多企业的经验证明，要做好两手抓，必须具体抓、踏踏实实地抓。具体抓大致有两个方面。一要作好两手抓的具体安排。现代企业的生产大都是连续性的也是复杂的，没有具体安排，两手抓就可能落空。在这方面许多企业都有了一些成功的经验，比如一个月的上中旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备，各级生产组织的领导人有具体分工，有人专抓生产，有人专抓准备等等。这些方法都很好，但是光有具体安排，并不等于就作好了两手抓。更重要的一个方面，还在于领导者是不是经常深入生产前线，及时发现和解决两手抓中的具体问题。因为不论生产和准备，也不论是生产和生活，抓好抓不好的标准，在于是不是解决问题。企业领导人只坐在办公室中两手抓，不容易捉摸到工作中的具体关键，就好像从远远的地方看山的峰峦，只能看到轮廓，看不清楚山上花草树木的具体形象，因而是不容易抓好的。抓生产，就要到车间、工段、小组中去抓；抓生活就要到食堂、宿舍、托儿所去抓；这样就易于发现问题。过去要“过五关”才能解决的问题，现在过一关就把问题解决了。所以具体抓是做好两手抓的保证。
    现在，大批大批的企业领导干部都到第一线去安营扎寨了，这给两手抓创造了更为有利的形势和条件。我们既学会了两手抓，又能深入、踏实、具体地抓，这样，我们领导工作的基础就更强固了，也更有力了，我们就一定能在第二季度增产的基础上，使第三季度有更大的增产。
