Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 1st. The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary today stating: "Recently, the frequent provocations by US imperialism against the People's Republic of China have intensified the tension in the Taiwan Strait. American robbers are dispatching aircraft and warships from the air and sea to undermine China's territorial sovereignty, stepping up espionage and acts of banditry. This is a deliberate and despicable action by the US government."

The commentary said that the Chinese government has issued one hundred warnings to US imperialism regarding these provocative actions. This demonstrates the Chinese people's well-considered and immense patience, but at the same time, they are determined to inflict a painful blow on anyone who dares to launch a reckless attack.

The commentary pointed out that the "paper tiger" cannot intimidate the Chinese people. The clamoring from the imperialist side and the piratical behavior of aircraft and warships muddy the peaceful waters, but the enemy will never be able to fish in troubled waters. The Chinese people are vigilant.

    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”发表评论
    斥美帝国主义对中国的侵略
    新华社地拉那1日电  阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”今天发表评论说：“最近，美帝国主义反对中华人民共和国的经常挑衅加剧了台湾海峡的紧张局势，美国强盗从空中、从海上派遣飞机和军舰破坏中国的领土主权，加紧间谍活动和强盗行为，这是美国政府蓄意的卑鄙行动。”
    评论说，中国政府已经就这些挑衅行为向美帝国主义提出了一百次警告，这是中国人民深思熟虑的巨大耐心，但同时他们有着对任何胆敢发动疯狂进攻的人予以痛击的决心。
    评论指出：“纸老虎”是吓不倒中国人民的，从帝国主义那一边发出的叫嚣和飞机军舰的海盗行为搅浑了平静的海水，但敌人永远也不能混水摸鱼，中国人民是警惕着的。
