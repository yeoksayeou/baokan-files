Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Tokyo News: In order to strive for the victory of the "June 22nd" general strike, Japanese workers and various groups are actively carrying out various preparatory work.

The "June 22nd" general strike is the fourth general strike held by Japanese workers in June to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The streets of Tokyo these days are full of the active atmosphere of struggle. Propaganda teams composed of workers from various enterprises are carrying out propaganda activities at the main train stations in Tokyo. They are distributing leaflets to passers-by, calling on people to support the "June 22" general strike.

The main force of this general strike, the national railway workers, are actively preparing to launch a strong struggle. At Tokyo Station, the starting point of Japan's main railway line, the Tokaido Line, 500 railway workers have been organized into pickets since the morning of the 20th to guard against sabotage by the national railway authorities, police agencies, and right-wing violent groups. The number of pickets is constantly increasing, and workers from other enterprises have also come to participate in the picket activities.

About 4,000 students in one group and about 3,000 students in another group in Tokyo went to the main stations in Tokyo this evening to support the railway workers who are scheduled to hold a general strike on the morning of the 22nd.

The students called on citizens to support the general strike. Many of them will stay overnight at various train stations to protect the strikers from attacks by hired fascist thugs.

This afternoon, these students held mass rallies near the Diet, and braved heavy rain to march to the Prime Minister's Residence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and protesting against the Nobusuke Kishi group's atrocities in killing Michiko Kamba, a female student at the University of Tokyo.

This morning, the Joint Struggle Conference of the National Public Service Employees' Union distributed many leaflets in the Kasumigaseki area, where Tokyo government agencies are concentrated. Through leaflets, it called on government agency employees to hold two-hour workplace meetings on the morning of the 22nd to replace the banned strike.

The cadres and activists of the All-Japan Federation of Agricultural Associations' Union are busy printing leaflets, and their faces show confidence that the struggle will surely be won. Nishikawa Megumu, secretary-general of the All-Japan Federation of Agricultural Associations' Union, said that because the law stipulates that state public servants will be punished for participating in strikes, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry authorities are looking for opportunities to punish union activists, but the workers have clearly realized that only by launching a strong struggle can they smash their conspiracy and overthrow the reactionary and traitorous Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Union of the Japan Teachers' Union, which is scheduled to suspend classes on the 22nd, has distributed letters to students' parents, calling on parents to support the teachers' struggle. Many teachers visited students' parents door-to-door and handed them the letters.

The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union decided to hold one-hour workplace meetings at sixty-six union branches, with the Railway Postal and Telecommunications Bureau as the main force, to participate in the general strike.

The Tokyo Postal and Telecommunications Bureau dispatches a propaganda team of 150 people to the nearby streets every day to call on citizens to support the general strike, and also sends out about 20 bicycle propaganda teams to carry out propaganda on the streets.

Sixty thousand stores in twenty-four prefectures have decided to close down on the 22nd. Eight thousand stores in Tokyo and ten thousand stores in Osaka will also participate in the strike. The store owners in Tokyo who participated in the strike also decided to send food to the workers and citizens who participated in the strike and demonstrations.

The National Federation of Farmers' Associations of Japan, a nationwide organization of Japanese farmers, issued a statement on the 21st, expressing full support for the general strike of worker brothers.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Tokyo News: More than a dozen mass rallies attended by ordinary citizens were held in Tokyo tonight to show support for the fourth general strike against the "Security Treaty" scheduled for tomorrow.

Citizens and male and female actors participated in the meeting held at Shibuya Station. Yoshimi Takeuchi, former professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, spoke at the meeting, calling on participants and passers-by to help workers hold a general strike, thereby giving the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet a fatal blow.

Naraoka Tomoko, a stage actress, said at the meeting that she enthusiastically supports the workers' strike because she does not want the catastrophe of war to repeat itself.

After the meeting, the participants were divided into several groups, each of which went to a major station in Tokyo to participate in the preparations for tomorrow's general strike.

Groups of workers and citizens arrived at the main stations in Tokyo to support the general strike of railway employees.
