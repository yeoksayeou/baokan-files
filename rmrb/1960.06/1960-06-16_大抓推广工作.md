    Vigorously Grasp Promotion Work

    The entire process of the technological revolution is a continuous process of innovation and creation, continuous promotion, that is, continuous improvement and continuous popularization. Popularization and improvement are unified and inseparable. There is no great improvement without great popularization. Popularization is the basis of improvement, and it has a particularly important significance in the entire technological revolution. We know that innovation and creation itself is not the purpose, nor is innovation and creation for show or to look good, but for use in production to promote the development of social productive forces. A large number of innovations and creations have been made, but if they are not used or promoted, then the innovations and creations will lose their meaning. Therefore, innovation and creation is not the end of the technological revolution, but only the beginning of the technological revolution. When the technological revolution blossoms and bears fruit, we must harvest and eat these fruits, so that advanced technologies, experiences, and innovations become the level of the entire type of work, the entire industry, and even the entire society. Promoting advanced technologies and advanced experiences not only prepares the conditions for further improvement of various innovations and promotes the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, but also has a pivotal impact and an immediate effect on our current socialist construction. The faster and better the promotion, the faster our production and construction will soar and the face of our society will change greatly. For example, after more than 5,000 resin-tapping workers in various counties of Nanping Prefecture widely promoted the new chemical resin-tapping method created by resin-tapping workers in Chong'an County, the resin-tapping volume rapidly increased from more than ten catties per person per day to about forty catties, and the average resin yield per pine tree increased sharply from one or two taels to more than three or four taels, thereby increasing the production of rosin in the entire prefecture by four times compared with the same period last year, achieving a non-slack season in the off-season. After the metallurgical system of Fuzhou City promoted the experience of anti-circumferential discs for steel rolling, work efficiency increased by four to thirty times. It is not difficult to imagine how great an impact it would have on socialist construction if hundreds of thousands or millions of innovations and advanced experiences in the entire province, as well as many major advanced experiences from fraternal provinces, were rapidly and widely promoted. Therefore, in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, we must never ignore or relax the important link of promotion.

    Innovations and creations made with indigenous methods are native-born and raised, and come from the masses with rich practical production experience, and therefore have strong vitality. Indigenous innovations and indigenous creations are original methods that start from our actual conditions and actual needs. Although they may not be found in technical and theoretical works from ancient times to the present, they are by no means backward. Indigenous methods are not only simple and easy to implement, easy to solve raw materials, and easy to promote, which is conducive to the most fully mobilizing the masses, but many are advanced, and even in certain conditions, some far exceed foreign methods. Engels said it well: "Once a technical need arises in society, this need will push science forward more than a dozen universities." Moreover, the concepts of indigenous and foreign are not fixed. The indigenous can produce the foreign. In the process of promoting the hand-cranked drill recommended by the Shaowu on-site conference, the Yongchun Tianhushan Coal Mine further developed the hand-cranked drill and trial-produced an electric drill, which increased work efficiency dozens of times compared to manual labor and five times compared to pneumatic picks. It can be seen that there is much to be done with "indigenous" methods. It is wrong to look down on indigenous methods, to be unwilling to promote innovations and creations made with indigenous methods, or to think that the conditions of one's own department or enterprise are poor and it is impossible to organize promotion.

    The emergence of any new thing cannot be perfect and complete from the beginning. The innovations and creations of the masses may also be relatively simple and crude at the beginning. However, it should be understood that it is an objective law of the development of things to go from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. There is no complex without simple, and no high-level without low-level. Only through large-scale popularization and promotion, through the practice of millions of people, and by concentrating the wisdom of millions of people to summarize and improve, can the initial and simple creation be rapidly improved. We cannot lie down and wait for various technologies to develop to the "top" before promoting them. The development of the technological revolution is endless. "There are mountains beyond mountains, and there is heaven beyond heaven." The time to reach the top simply does not exist. If everyone lies down and waits, then the technological revolution cannot develop, which is equivalent to abolishing the technological revolution. In this situation of surging technological revolution and galloping construction, whoever is complacent and relaxes, and stays in the middle for a while, will fall behind. Therefore, the correct attitude should be: to be down-to-earth, start from reality, hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, create and innovate non-stop, organize promotion non-stop, summarize while creating, promote while summarizing, and improve while promoting. To experiment in the process of promotion, and to improve in the process of popularization, so that advanced experience can be continuously consolidated, developed, expanded, improved, and perfected in the process of promotion.

### 大抓推广工作

    大抓推广工作
    整个技术革命的进程，是不断革新创造，不断推广，亦即不断提高、不断普及的过程。普及和提高是统一和不可分割的。没有大普及就没有大提高。普及是提高的基础，它在整个技术革命中具有特殊重要的意义。我们知道，革新创造本身不是目的，革新创造也不是为了摆样子、好看，而是为了用于生产，促进社会生产力的发展。革新创造了一大批，如果不使用，不推广，那么，革新创造也就失去了意义。因此，革新创造并不是技术革命的终结，而仅仅是技术革命的开始。技术革命开了花，结了果，我们就要去收获，吃这些果实，使先进的技术、经验和革新创造，成为整个工种、整个行业甚至于整个社会的水平。推广先进技术、先进经验，不仅为各项创造革新的进一步提高准备条件，推动技术革新、技术革命运动的发展，而且对我们当前社会主义建设具有举足轻重的影响和立竿见影的效果。推广得快，推广得好，我们的生产建设就能扶摇直上，面貌大变。譬如南平专区各县五千多个采脂工人，在普遍推广了崇安县采脂工人创造的化学采脂的新方法后，采脂量由原来每人每天十几斤迅速提高到四十斤左右，每株松树的出脂率平均由一两猛增到三、四两以上，从而使全专区今年松香生产比去年同期增长了四倍，作到了淡季不淡。福州市冶金系统推广了轧钢的反围盘的经验后，提高工效四倍到三十倍。不难想像，如果全省几十万条、成百万条革新创造和先进经验，以及兄弟省的许多重大的先进经验，都迅速地普遍地推广起来，这将对社会主义建设发生何等巨大的作用。因此，在技术革新、技术革命运动中，我们绝不能忽视或放松推广这一重要环节。
    用土办法搞出的革新创造是土生土长的，是从有丰富的实际生产经验的群众中来的，因而是具有强大生命力的。土革新土创造是从我们实际条件和实际需要出发的独创的办法，虽然它可能是古今中外技术理论著作中找不到的，但它绝不是落后的。土办法不仅简便易行，易于解决原材料，易于推广，有利于最充分地动员群众，而且许多是先进的，甚至在一定条件下有的还远远超过洋办法。恩格斯说得好：“社会方面一旦发生了技术上的需要，则这种需要就会比十数个大学更加把科学推向前进”。况且，土和洋的概念也不是固定不变的。土中能够出洋。永春天湖山煤矿在推广邵武现场会议推荐的手摇钻的过程中，进一步发展了手摇钻，试制成一种电钻，工效比人工提高数十倍，比风镐提高五倍。由此可见，“土”中大有文章可做，看不起土办法，不愿意推广土法搞的革新创造，或认为自己部门、企业条件差，无法组织推广的思想都是错误的。
    任何一个新生事物的出现，不可能一开始就十全十美、完整无缺的。群众的革新创造开始时也可能比较简单粗糙。但是，应该了解，从简单到复杂，从低级到高级，这是事物发展的客观规律，没有简单就没有复杂，没有低级就没有高级。只有大普及、大推广，通过千百万人的实践，集中千百万人的智慧，进行总结和改进，才能将初级的简单的创造迅速提高。我们不能躺着等各种技术发展到了“顶”再来推广。技术革命的发展永无止境，“山外有山，天外有天”，到顶的时候是根本不存在的。如果大家都躺着等，那末技术革命就不能发展，这也就等于取消了技术革命。在这技术革命浪潮汹涌、各项建设万马奔腾的形势下，谁要是自满松懈，在中途稍一停留，谁就会落到下游。因此，正确的态度应该是：脚踏实地，从实际出发，高举不断革命的红旗，一刻不停地创造革新，一刻不停地组织推广，边创造边总结，边总结边推广，边推广边提高，从推广中试验，从普及中提高，使先进经验在推广的过程中，不断巩固、发展、扩大、提高和完善。
