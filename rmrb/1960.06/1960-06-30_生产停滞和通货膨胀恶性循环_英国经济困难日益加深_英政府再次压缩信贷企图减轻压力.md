Xinhua News Agency, London, Electric Dispatch by Reporter Peng Di: The British government is once again compressing credit, attempting to alleviate the pressure of economic difficulties in this way. On the 24th, it announced an increase in the bank discount rate from 5% to 6%, and a reduction in investment in state-owned industries and social services.

It is anticipated that the government's recent decisions will severely restrict industrial development and will increase unemployment and high prices.

The British bank discount rate was 7% in September 1957, reaching the highest level since the war. In 1958, the discount rate fell five times, dropping to 4%. In January of this year, the discount rate rose to 5%. Now it has risen to 6%, approaching the unprecedentedly high record since the war.

The British government's monetary measures going from one extreme to the other reflect the country's economic state being in a long-term difficult situation. A policy of compressing credit always creates a state of economic stagnation, as in the period from 1956 to 1958; while a not-so-tight monetary policy will certainly create the threat of domestic inflation, as well as difficulties in foreign payments and a pound crisis. A noteworthy recent tendency is that the cycle of the vicious circle between economic stagnation and inflation has become shorter and shorter.

The "Financial Times" editorial on the 24th talked about the difficulties facing Britain, saying that inflationary pressures have once again become a threat to the British economy. The editorial also said: "There are already signs that excessive domestic demand has hampered some exports. Although people believe that last year's balance of payments was somewhat disappointing, this year will probably be worse than last year. Due to inventory accumulation, imports have expanded. If further measures are not taken, things may be more difficult by the weak pound's autumn. What makes the risk even greater is that this year, unlike in the past, countries in the sterling area other than the UK are using up their reserves instead of accumulating them."

The "Financial Times" pointed out: "The lack of continuous development has become the most serious weakness of the British economy since the war."

    生产停滞和通货膨胀恶性循环
    英国经济困难日益加深
    英政府再次压缩信贷企图减轻压力
    据新华社伦敦电　记者彭迪报道：英国政府再次压缩信贷，企图这样来减轻经济困难的压力。它在24日宣布把银行贴现率从5％提高到6％，并且削减对国营工业和社会服务业的投资。
    预料，最近政府的决定将使工业发展受到严格限制，并且将使失业增加和物价高涨。
    英国的银行贴现率在1957年9 月是7％，达到了战后最高的水平。在1958年，贴现率下降了五次，直跌到4％。今年1月，贴现率上升到5％。现在又上升到6％，接近于战后空前高的纪录。
    英国政府的货币措施从一个极端转到另一个极端，这反映了这个国家的经济处于长期的困难状态中。压缩信贷的政策总是会造成经济停滞的状态，像1956年到58年期间那样；而一个不怎样紧缩的货币政策则肯定会造成国内通货膨胀的威胁以及对外支付困难和英镑危机。最近值得注意的倾向是：经济停滞和通货膨胀之间的恶性循环的周期已经愈来愈短。
    “金融时报”24日的社论谈到英国面临的困难，它说，通货膨胀的压力再度成为对英国经济的威胁。社论还说：“已经有迹象表明，过份的国内需求已经妨害了一些输出。虽然人们认为去年的支付平衡是有些令人失望的，而今年则大概要比去年更糟。由于积累存货，输入已经扩大。如果不进一步采取措施，到英镑疲软的秋天，事情就可能更难办。使得风险更大的是：今年和过去不一样，除英国以外的英镑区国家正在用掉它们的储备，而不是再积累储备。”
    “金融时报”指出：“缺乏不断的发展已经成为战后英国经济最严重的弱点。”
