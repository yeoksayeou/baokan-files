    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 21 – The people of Calcutta, India, held a rally on the 18th to express their support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    According to Calcutta newspapers, a resolution passed at the rally emphasized that world peace can only be achieved by driving U.S. imperialism into a corner. The resolution demanded the cancellation of U.S. military bases in all countries, especially in Asian countries, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

    The rally was convened by the West Bengal branch of the Communist Party of India and the Marxist Forward Bloc.

    Jyoti Basu, a leader of the Communist Party in West Bengal, spoke at the meeting, congratulating the Japanese people on their initial victories in the broad struggle against U.S. imperialism. He called on those attending the meeting to spread the news of the Japanese people's struggle to all urban and rural areas of West Bengal.

    The Indian "Liberty" newspaper published an editorial on the 18th calling on the Indian people to "rise up and support the historically significant struggle of the Japanese masses." The editorial pointed out that the odious U.S. war plan has not ended, and patriots in Asian countries should resolutely unite to express their fraternal solidarity with the struggling Japanese people.
