Comrades!

I fully endorse the instructions given by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the conference, and the report by Comrade Lin Feng. With boundless excitement, I extend my warm congratulations to this conference and to the representatives present. Congratulations on the great victories of the leap forward in cultural and educational undertakings in the past few years under the leadership of the Party, congratulations on the great unity of advanced representatives from all aspects of the cultural and educational front and all cultural and educational workers, and congratulations on the continuous development and greater victory of the new high tide of China's cultural revolution.

China's cultural and educational undertakings, along with the rapid development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, have seen an unprecedented flourishing situation. Chairman Mao said, "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear. The era when the Chinese were regarded as uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." Chairman Mao's instruction is inspiring us to forge ahead courageously.

The development of China's sports cause after liberation proves that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership is also manifested in sports work. Because we have continuously criticized bourgeois ideas such as sports being detached from politics and "sports for sports' sake" under the leadership of the Party, shattered the rampant attacks of bourgeois right-wing elements on the sports front, and won the victory against right-leaning opportunist elements within the Party, resolutely implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's sports work policy, our sports cause has truly become a socialist cause led by the Party and serving production labor and national defense construction. This has enabled sports to develop into a mass movement involving hundreds of millions of people today. Doing exercises, practicing boxing, playing ball games, and strengthening the body have become new fashions of our time. More than 30 million people across the country have reached the labor and defense system standards in regular physical exercise, and more than 5 million people have reached the standards of graded athletes. A vigorous scene of vigorously engaging in sports and diligent exercise has emerged in many cities and villages.

The popularization of mass sports has created a broad and solid foundation for the rapid improvement of sports technology. In the past decade, Chinese athletes have created and broken 3,860 national records and 32 world records, and won the world championship in men's singles table tennis. At the First National Games held last year to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four world records and 844 national records were broken in just two weeks. New forces continue to emerge and grow rapidly. For example, Mei Yan, Guo Xin'e, and Zhang Jingwen, who broke the world record for women's parachuting, had been learning parachuting for less than a year; Dong Guangrong participated in shooting sports for only one year and achieved a score equal to the world record in small-bore rifle shooting; Zhou Yongqi, an 18-year-old backstroke swimmer, has broken the national record 20 times; the Chinese table tennis B team, composed of young players such as Zhuang Zedong and Li Furong, went on an expedition to Europe and defeated many world-class masters, achieving a brilliant record of five wins and one draw in the United Kingdom, and won four championships and four runner-up titles in two international competitions held in Hungary and Sweden. This kind of atmosphere of new people emerging endlessly shows the vigorous vitality and infinitely bright prospects of China's sports cause.

The speed of improvement in China's sports technology far exceeds that of all capitalist countries. Recently, China's mountaineering team, after all kinds of hardships and overcoming numerous difficulties, in the face of unpredictable and harsh weather conditions, and in the extreme lack of oxygen, with soaring drive, the heroic spirit of collectivism, and the steadfast and indomitable, united and mutually assisting communist qualities, braved violent winds and blizzards, along glaciers and snow ridges and jagged cliffs, stepping on ten thousand years of accumulated snow, crossed unfathomable ice crevasses, and planted the five-star red flag on the world's highest peak - Mount Qomolangma, at an altitude of 8,882 meters above sea level. This is the victory of the Party's general line, the victory of the incomparably superior socialist system, and the victory of the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples. People once compared Mount Qomolangma to the South Pole and North Pole because of its treacherous terrain and inaccessible human traces, calling it the world's "third pole." The north slope of Mount Qomolangma is also the most complex terrain in the entire mountain range. Since 1921, foreign mountaineering teams have attempted to climb Mount Qomolangma from the north slope seven times, but failed time and time again. As a result, they came to the conclusion that "this road cannot be climbed" and is "impossible to surpass." However, the new China has only been engaged in mountaineering for five years, and the young mountaineers have succeeded in one fell swoop, creating a feat in human history of climbing the world's highest peak from the north slope, leaving the mountaineering teams of capitalist countries with a history of more than 100 years far behind. Not long before this, eight young Han and Tibetan girls climbed the 7,546-meter "Father of Ice Mountains" - Muztagh Ata Peak, setting a world record for women's mountaineering. Western capitalist countries have been engaged in women's mountaineering for more than 60 years, and have only climbed to 7,456 meters. China's mountaineering movement and countless other facts vividly prove that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people not only have the infinite power and wisdom to transform the old world and build a new society, but also have outstanding athletic talents.

With the development of the sports cause, the sports team is growing day by day. Various sports colleges and universities have trained a group of sports professionals and sports scientific research talents. In particular, through youth amateur sports schools and grassroots sports teams, tens of millions of sports activists have been trained. Such a strong team is the backbone of carrying out mass sports activities, and also provides a solid foundation for improving sports technology. The political and ideological outlook of the sports team has also undergone tremendous changes. Under the leadership and education of the Party, the vast number of sports workers have worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's writings, actively participated in various political movements, continuously transformed their thinking, and followed the road of being both red and expert. They have further recognized the role of sports in socialist construction, and thus love this cause even more, working actively, studying diligently, and making great achievements. Many people have joined the Communist Party, and advanced figures have emerged in batches. At this grand gathering of heroes, among the advanced representatives from the sports front are sports teachers who have worked diligently for years, constantly improving teaching methods and improving teaching quality; coaches who have worked hard, boldly created, dared to innovate, and cultivated a large number of outstanding athletes; sports cadres who are good at contacting the masses, mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in exercises; sports activists who set an example and lead others to exercise diligently; models who have made comprehensive leaps forward in thinking, labor, learning, and sports, and so on. A working-class sports team that is both red and expert is growing rapidly.

China's brilliant achievements in sports are the result of adhering to politics in command, adhering to serving labor production and national defense construction, implementing "walking on two legs," and closely combining the popularization and improvement of sports under the leadership of the Party and the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is also inseparable from the efforts of the vast number of sports workers.

The Party and Chairman Mao have always cared about and attached importance to sports, and clearly instructed that the fundamental task of sports is to enhance the people's physique and serve labor production and national defense construction. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the vast number of sports workers, following the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, have displayed soaring energy, worked diligently, and done everything possible to mobilize and organize the masses to participate in physical exercise. Mass sports activities have been widely carried out, thus effectively enhancing the people's physique and promoting socialist construction. For example, the Shanghai Food Company's Meat Processing Factory, despite having small sports grounds and poor sports equipment, has made great efforts to engage in sports in a simple and economical way. The number of employees regularly participating in activities has reached more than 90%, and their physical fitness has been generally enhanced. The factory's attendance rate has increased from 94.98% in 1957 to 98.01% in 1959. Many people are not only advanced producers but also active participants in physical exercise. In 1959, sports activists accounted for 50.7% of the factory-level advanced producers. This situation has played a positive role in improving labor productivity. Compared with 1958, labor productivity increased by 100% in 1959. The factory's main workshop, the livestock workshop, was also rated as a national advanced production unit.

The establishment of urban and rural people's communes and the development of public canteens have opened up broader prospects for carrying out mass sports activities. Public canteens have not only become the center for organizing and arranging people's lives and conducting political and cultural education, but also facilitate organizing mass cultural entertainment and sports activities. Tongren County, Guizhou Province, mobilized the masses throughout the county to build "four-in-one" sports grounds next to nearly 2,000 canteens that are "able to exercise, able to train soldiers, able to hold meetings, and able to dry grain," made more than 30,000 pieces of various sports equipment by themselves, and mobilized and organized about 50% of the people to regularly participate in physical exercise. This has enhanced the physique, cheered the mood, and increased the enthusiasm of the people in this mountainous area, with an attendance rate of more than 98%. Although they suffered a severe drought in the past year, the worst in a century, under the leadership of the Party and the commune, they organized an anti-drought army of 110,000 people, fought for 40 days, and saved 200,000 mu of dry land. The total agricultural output value increased by 13% compared to the great leap forward of 1958. This completely changed the miserable scene of abandoned crops due to illness before liberation, where "in August when the millet turns yellow, people go to bed with malaria, get well and go to harvest the grain, leaving a desolate scene."

The widespread development of sports activities not only enhanced the physical fitness of the commune members and promoted production, but also played a great role in changing customs and habits. In Peizhuang People's Commune, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, there is a "Seagull" sports training team organized by young women. When it was first established, many people "stabbed their backs" behind their backs, and some people with deeper old ideas even composed allegro to satirize them, saying: "A strange wind is blowing in Peizhuang Village, young women have become monsters." Some team members were somewhat shaken in their thinking. At this time, the Party gave them encouragement and support. Under the leadership of Captain Liu Qinglian, all team members worked hard on production while adhering to exercise, determined to use practical achievements to reverse some of the masses' backward views. After more than a year of exercise, several weak and sick team members became strong and became strong laborers and youth assault team members. Their transformation from weakness to health was widely publicized among the masses like important news. In this place, women never did farm work such as plowing and harrowing. Driven by the Seagull team members, the number of women attending work greatly increased, and they could also do some farm work. During the great drought last year when it did not rain for 100 days, the Seagull team members responded to the Party's call and formed a 60-member assault team to carry water to fight the drought, saving more than 40 mu of corn and more than 60 mu of cotton, driving the whole commune to form a climax of drought resistance. The wheat experimental field they planted achieved a high yield of 720 jin per mu. Because of their remarkable achievements in production and sports under the education of the Party, they were rated as an advanced collective and attended the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. People who used to satirize them had to change their tune and sing: "This group of women is not simple, they take the lead everywhere, exercise and engage in production, who doesn't like to see them?" The elderly personally send their daughters and daughters-in-law to participate in the Seagull team. Young men want to find capable, healthy, and lively Seagull team members as objects, which is a popular story.

Examples of production driving sports and sports benefiting production can be found everywhere, such as Gaotang County in Shandong Province, Beipiao County in Liaoning Province, and the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory, which are all well-known throughout the country.

In schools at all levels, sports are one of the important aspects of cultivating a younger generation with all-round development of morality, intelligence, and physique. Dunhua No. 2 Middle School in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has always been very active in sports activities. 90% of the students have passed the labor and defense system and have broken the national speed skating record 11 times. The widespread development of sports activities has enhanced the students' physical fitness. When the flu spread, Dunhua No. 2 Middle School was able to avoid the flu and continue classes as usual. The medical expenses in the first quarter of this year were only 3.7 yuan. Students' academic achievements and communist ideology are also constantly improving. According to the statistics of four subjects, Chinese, algebra, etc., in the second class of the second year of senior high school, the percentage of students with excellent grades has increased from 35% to 54.5% in the past year; all 136 members of the school's various sports teams have been rated as excellent in conduct. The improvement in physical fitness has also powerfully promoted labor production. This school is not only a national red flag unit for school sports, but also an advanced unit for cultural revolution and a pacesetter for work-study programs in the autonomous prefecture. The facts in many schools prove that wherever the Party's all-round development education policy is implemented, which follows Chairman Mao's instruction "to enable those being educated to develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physique, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," excellent results can be achieved.

At present, the east wind is blowing vigorously, and the situation in our country is very good, and the situation in sports is also very good. Not long ago, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed that whatever can be done should be promoted, such as gymnastics, ball games, running, climbing mountains, swimming, practicing Taijiquan, and various other sports activities. This instruction, once implemented among the broad masses of people, immediately became a huge material force, powerfully promoting the further development of mass sports in urban and rural areas. From the east coast to the Tianshan Mountains, from Qiongya to Heilongjiang, a magnificent new upsurge of mass sports is unfolding vigorously across the country. For example, Sichuan Province has launched a mass movement with 40 million people participating in various sports projects; more than 50% of the people in many cities and counties participate in physical exercise; many places have launched large-scale mass competition activities. Various places have also cooperated with the movement of all people becoming soldiers to vigorously engage in national defense sports activities such as shooting, radio, aviation models, and navigation. In Liaoning Province alone, the number of participants has reached more than 4 million, accounting for one-sixth of the province's total population. In Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, 150,000 militiamen are vigorously engaged in national defense sports, and more than 1,000 grassroots national defense sports clubs have been established in just a few months. In teaching work, a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is forming a climax. Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education have contributed more than 7,000 suggestions on teaching methods, teaching aids, and equipment, which has greatly promoted teaching reform, and people's ideological outlook has also undergone profound changes. Under the leadership of the Party, the sports front is showing a flourishing and prosperous scene.

However, our work is still far from the demands of the Party and the people. The vast number of sports workers must conscientiously study the congratulatory message delivered by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the conference, and the report by Comrade Lin Feng, conscientiously study the instructions and reports made to us by Premier Zhou and other leading comrades, recognize the current excellent situation, and closely follow the development of the situation, with the magnificent spirit of changing customs and habits and transforming the world, the spirit of continuous revolution, continue to make persistent efforts, and push China's sports movement to a new stage.

In order to better enable sports to serve the enhancement of the people's physique and serve labor production and national defense construction, we must continue to implement the Party Central Committee's instruction to vigorously carry out mass sports activities, and on the basis of the widespread development of sports activities, improve technical level and constantly create new records. We must promote vigorously, publicize greatly, and mobilize the masses to participate in 10-20 minutes of sports activities every day. Among the broad masses of young people, we must actively carry out ten major sports projects such as basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, skating, and shooting. Schools should continue to carry out labor and defense system exercises. Among children, we should actively promote active games. The elderly and weak can do exercises, practice Taijiquan, and take a walk. Among the militia, especially the backbone militia, we must vigorously carry out national defense sports activities. Factories and mines and rural areas should also combine with production to vigorously engage in field exercises, work break exercises, and various production exercises. While widely carrying out mass sports, we must do everything possible to improve China's sports level, strengthen training work, improve training quality, and constantly create new records and new achievements, and rapidly climb the peak of world sports. With the increasing development of the sports cause, more sports cadres are needed. We must run sports colleges, sports schools, and sports departments and disciplines of normal colleges and universities well, and also hold a large number of short-term training courses for sports cadres and various amateur sports schools. The movement of technological innovation and technological revolution in sports work should be carried out more widely and deeply, setting off a wave of enthusiasm. To accomplish the above tasks, we must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to politics in command; implement the mass line, vigorously engage in mass movements; implement the policy of walking on two legs, closely combining the popularization and improvement of sports; focus on production, combine with production, and carry out a variety of sports activities according to the different characteristics of various labor productions. In order to promote the continuous development of sports wave after wave, we must promptly summarize experience, promote experience, insert red flags widely, set up pacesetters widely, advocate the communist style of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, mobilize the people to participate in exercise, and make sports better serve the people's health, labor production, and national defense construction.

Sports are not only the most active and effective way to enhance the people's physique, but also one of the important means of conducting communist education among the masses. In carrying out sports activities, we must greatly promote the revolutionary spirit of collectivism, cultivate communist moral qualities, and fight against various bourgeois ideologies and styles of work.

Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for guiding all work from victory to new victories. In order to do sports work better, the vast number of sports workers must work hard to study Chairman Mao's writings, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, strengthen ideological transformation, continuously launch irreconcilable struggles with various bourgeois ideas, improve socialist and communist consciousness, establish a proletarian world view, and strive to move towards the direction of being both red and expert.

We believe that with the great leap forward and great development of production, sports will also inevitably experience a new situation of continuous leap forward with one upsurge after another, with great popularization and great improvement. It can be imagined that in the future, sports will become an indispensable part of the daily life of the people throughout the country, and the people who regularly participate in sports will not only be tens of millions, but hundreds of millions, and the people's physique will be further enhanced, and the younger generation will be tall, strong, and physically strong, with sufficient physical capital for interstellar travel or undersea exploration. At that time, China's sports technology level will also be greatly improved, and we will have a large number of world record holders and world champions. China will surely become a country with a highly developed sports.

The task of sports work is glorious and great. In fulfilling these tasks, advanced sports workers should become models for the vast number of sports workers, maintain humility, prevent arrogance and complacency, promote the communist style of giving honor to others and leaving difficulties to themselves, further play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridging role, and lead the vast number of masses to move forward together.

Let us, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the three red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, vigorously engage in urban and rural sports, and work together with comrades on the education, culture, health, and news fronts to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense! Strive to realize communism in the future!

    大力开展城乡体育运动为社会主义建设服务
    ——在全国文教先进工作者代表大会体育工作系统会议上的讲话
    中华人民共和国体育运动委员会副主任　　黄中
    同志们！
    我完全拥护陆定一同志代表党中央、国务院对大会所作的指示和林枫同志的报告，并以无限兴奋的心情向这次大会和到会的代表致以热烈的祝贺。祝贺在党的领导下，几年来文教事业大跃进的巨大胜利，祝贺文教战线各方面的先进代表及全体文教工作者的大团结，祝贺我国文化革命新高潮不断地向前发展，取得更大的胜利。
    我国文化教育事业随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的迅速发展，出现了空前繁荣的局面。毛主席说过：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。毛主席的这个指示正在鼓舞着我们奋勇前进。
    解放后，我国体育事业发展的过程，证明无产阶级同资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争也表现在体育工作中。由于我们在党的领导下，不断地批判了体育脱离政治、“为体育而体育”等资产阶级思想，粉碎了体育战线上资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，取得了反对党内右倾机会主义分子的胜利，坚决贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和党的体育工作方针，才使我国的体育事业真正成为党所领导的、为生产劳动和国防建设服务的社会主义事业；才使体育运动发展为今天成亿人参加的、规模巨大的群众运动。做操练拳、赛球竞技、强身习武已成为我们时代的新风尚。全国有三千多万人在经常的体育锻炼中达到了劳卫制标准，五百多万人达到等级运动员标准。在许多城市和乡村中出现了大搞体育、勤奋锻炼的蓬勃景象。
    群众体育的普及，为运动技术水平的飞速提高造成了广阔、坚实的基础。十年来，我国运动员创造和打破了三千八百六十次全国纪录、三十二次世界纪录，并获得乒乓球男子单打世界冠军；去年迎接建国十周年举行的第一届全运会，在短短的两周中，就打破四项世界纪录，八百四十四次全国纪录。新生力量不断出现，迅速成长。如打破女子跳伞世界纪录的梅严、郭新娥、张景文，学跳伞还不到一年；董光荣参加射击运动仅仅一年，就在小口径步枪射击中获得了和世界纪录相等的成绩；十八岁的仰泳运动员周咏琪已二十次打破全国纪录；由小将庄则栋和李富荣等组成的中国乒乓球乙队，远征欧洲，打败了许多世界第一流名手，在英国获得了五胜一平的辉煌战绩，在匈牙利、瑞典举行的两次国际比赛中获得四项冠军和四项亚军。这种新人辈出、生生不已的气象，显示了我国体育事业旺盛的生命力和无限灿烂的前景。
    我国运动技术水平提高的速度，远远超过一切资本主义国家。最近，我国登山队，历尽千辛万苦，克服重重困难，在变化无常的恶劣气候中，在氧气极缺的情况下，以冲天的干劲，集体主义的英雄气魄，坚毅顽强、团结互助的共产主义品质，冒着狂风暴雪，沿着冰川雪岭和巉岩峭壁，踏着万年积雪，越过深不可测的冰裂缝，把五星红旗插上了拔海八千八百八十二米高度的世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰。这是党的总路线的胜利，是无比优越的社会主义制度的胜利，是汉藏各族人民团结一致的胜利。人们曾经因为珠穆朗玛峰的形势险恶、人迹难至，而把它和南极、北极相比，称之为世界“第三极”。珠穆朗玛峰的北坡又是整个山峰地形最复杂的地带。从1921年起，外国爬山队曾七次企图从北坡登上珠穆朗玛峰，但是一次一次地遭到失败。于是他们得出了一个结论，说“这条路是不能爬上去的”，是“无法超越的”。而新中国开展登山运动仅仅五年，年轻的登山运动员就一举成功，创造了人类历史上从北坡登上这个世界之巅的创举，把具有一百多年历史的资本主义国家的登山队远远抛在后边。在这以前不久，我国八名年轻的汉族和藏族姑娘登上了七千五百四十六米的“冰山之父”——慕士塔格山峰，创造了女子登山世界纪录。而西方资本主义国家女子登山运动已搞了六十多年，只爬到七千四百五十六米。我国登山运动和其他无数事实生动地证明：在党和毛主席的领导下，我国人民不仅具有改造旧世界、建设新社会的无穷力量和智慧，而且也有卓越的运动才能。
    随着体育事业的发展，体育队伍日益壮大。各体育院校培养了一批体育专业人才和体育科学研究人才。特别是通过青少年业余体育学校和基层运动队，培养了数以千万计的体育积极分子。这样一支强大的队伍是开展群众体育运动的骨干，也为提高运动技术提供了雄厚的基础。体育队伍的政治思想面貌也有巨大变化。在党的领导和教育下，广大体育工作者努力学习马列主义和毛主席著作，积极参加历次政治运动，不断地改造思想，走又红又专的道路。对于体育在社会主义建设中的作用有了进一步认识，从而更加热爱这项事业，积极工作，勤学苦练，作出了很大成绩。不少人参加了共产党，先进人物成批地涌现。在这次盛大的群英会上，从体育战线上来的先进代表中，有数年如一日、勤勤恳恳、不断改进教学方法、提高教学质量的体育教师；有刻苦钻研、大胆创造、敢于革新、培养了大批优秀运动员的教练；有善于联系群众、发动和组织群众参加锻炼的体育干部；有以身作则、带动别人勤奋锻炼的体育积极分子；有思想、劳动、学习、体育全面跃进的模范，等等。一支又红又专的工人阶级的体育队伍正在迅速成长。
    我国体育事业的辉煌成就，是在党的领导和毛泽东思想的旗帜下，坚持政治挂帅，坚持为劳动生产和国防建设服务，实行“两条腿走路”，把体育运动的普及和提高紧密结合起来，大搞群众运动的结果。也是和广大体育工作者的努力分不开的。
    党和毛主席一贯关怀和重视体育运动，并明确指示体育运动的根本任务是增强人民体质，为劳动生产和国防建设服务。广大体育工作者在各级党委的领导下，遵循着党和毛主席的指示，发挥了冲天干劲，兢兢业业，千方百计地动员和组织群众参加体育锻炼，群众性体育运动有了广泛开展，从而有效地增强了人民体质，促进了社会主义建设。如上海市食品公司肉类加工厂在运动场地小、体育设备差的情况下，因陋就简大搞体育，经常参加活动的职工达到90％以上，体质普遍增强。全厂出勤率从1957年的94．98％提高到1959年的98．01％。不少人不仅是先进生产者，而且是体育锻炼的积极分子。1959年厂级先进生产者中，体育积极分子占50．7％。这种情况对提高劳动生产率起了积极的作用，1959年和1958年比较，劳动生产率提高百分之百。该厂主要车间——牲畜工场还被评为全国先进生产单位。
    城乡人民公社的建立，公共食堂的发展，给开展群众性体育运动开辟了更为广阔的天地。公共食堂不仅成为组织、安排人民生活、进行政治文化教育的中心，而且是有利于组织群众文化娱乐和体育活动。贵州铜仁县发动全县群众在近两千个食堂旁边，修建了“能锻炼、能练兵、能开会、能晒谷”的四合一运动场，自制各种体育器材三万多件，发动和组织了约50％的人经常参加体育锻炼。使这个山区的人民体质增强、心情舒畅、干劲更大，出勤率高达98％以上。去年虽然遭受了百年来的特大旱灾，但在党和公社领导下，组织了十一万人的抗旱大军，奋战四十天，挽救了二十万亩旱田。农业总产值比大跃进的1958年还增长了13％。完全改变了解放前那种“八月谷子黄，摆子上了床，病好去收谷，满坝一片荒”的因病而荒芜庄稼的凄惨景象。
    体育活动的广泛开展，不仅增强了社员体质，促进了生产，而且大有移风易俗的作用。山西万荣县裴庄人民公社有一个由女青年组织起来的“海鸥”体育锻炼队。刚成立时，不少人在后面“戳背脊”，某些旧思想较深的人还编了快板讽刺她们说：“裴庄村里怪风兴，年青女子成妖精”。少数队员思想有些动摇，这时候，党给了她们鼓励和支持，在队长刘青莲的带领下，全体队员一面搞好生产，一面坚持锻炼，决心用实际成绩来扭转一些群众的落后看法。经过一年多锻炼，几个体弱多病的队员身体棒了，成了强劳动力，当上了青年突击队员。她们转病弱为康强的事，像重要新闻一样，为群众争相传诵。这个地方妇女从来不做犁地、耙地等农活，在海鸥队员的带动下，妇女出勤的人数大大增多，有些农活也都能做了。在去年百日无雨的大旱期间，海鸥队员响应党的号召，组成了一支六十多人的突击队，挑水抗旱，抢救了四十多亩玉米、六十多亩棉花，带动全社形成抗旱高潮。她们种的小麦试验田，获得亩产七百二十斤的高额丰收。由于她们在党的教育下，生产和体育成绩都很显著，被评为先进集体，出席了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表大会。过去讽刺她们的人也不得不改口唱道：“这群妇女不简单，处处带头起模范，锻炼身体搞生产，谁人见了不喜欢？”老人们亲自送自己的女儿、媳妇参加海鸥队。青年小伙子都要找能干、健壮、活泼的海鸥队员当对象，一时传为佳话。
    生产带动体育、体育有利于生产的例子，到处都可以找到，像山东高唐县、辽宁北票县、天津绒毛加工厂等，都是在全国闻名的。
    在各级学校中，体育是培养德智体全面发展的青年一代的重要方面之一。延边朝鲜族自治州敦化第二中学，体育活动一直很活跃，90％的学生通过劳卫制，并十一次打破速度滑冰全国纪录。体育活动的广泛开展，增强了学生的体质，在流行性感冒蔓延时，敦化二中却能免受感冒侵袭，照常上课，今年第一季度医疗费只用了三点七元。学生学业成绩和共产主义思想也不断提高。据高二二班汉语、代数等四门功课统计，一年来成绩优良的由35％增至54．5％；该校各项体育运动代表队员一百三十六人品行全部评为甲等。体质增强也有力地推动了劳动生产。这个学校既是全国学校体育红旗单位，又是自治州文化革命的先进单位和勤工俭学的标兵。很多学校的事实证明，凡是贯彻了毛主席关于“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的全面发展的教育方针，就一定能作出优异的成绩。
    目前，东风劲吹，我们国家的形势好得很，体育运动的形势也好得很。不久以前，党中央和毛主席指示，凡能做到的，都要提倡做体操，打球、跑步、爬山、游水、打太极拳及各种各色的体育运动。这个指示一贯彻到广大人民中，立即成为巨大的物质力量，有力地推动了城乡群众体育运动的进一步发展。从东海岸到天山、从琼崖到黑龙江，一个波澜壮阔的群众体育运动新高潮正在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地展开。如四川省掀起了有四千万人参加的多种多样体育项目的群众运动；好些市、县50％以上的人参加体育锻炼；许多地方开展了大规模的群众性竞赛活动。各地还配合全民皆兵运动，大搞射击、无线电、航空模型和航海等国防体育活动。仅辽宁一省参加活动的人数即达四百多万，占全省总人口的六分之一。山东寿张县十五万民兵大搞国防体育，短短几个月中就建立了一千多个基层的国防体育俱乐部。在教学工作中，一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮正在形成，北京体育学院师生，在教学方法、教具、器材等方面就献计七千多条，大大推动了教学改革，人们的思想面貌也起了深刻的变化。在党的领导下，体育战线出现了一片万紫千红、欣欣向荣的大好景象。
    但是，我们的工作离党和人民对我们的要求还很远。广大体育工作者必须认真学习陆定一同志代表党中央、国务院向大会所致的祝词和林枫同志的报告，认真学习周总理及其他领导同志对我们所作的指示和报告，认清当前的大好形势，并紧紧跟上形势的发展，以移风易俗、改造世界的雄伟气魄，不断革命的精神，再接再厉，把我国体育运动推向一个新阶段。
    为了更好地使体育为增强人民体质、为劳动生产和国防建设服务，必须继续贯彻党中央指示的大力开展群众性的体育运动，在体育运动广泛开展的基础上，提高技术水平，不断地创造新纪录的方针。大张旗鼓，大做宣传，动员群众每天参加一、二十分钟体育活动。在广大青少年中，积极开展篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球和田径、游泳、举重、体操、滑冰、射击等十个主要运动项目，学校中应继续进行劳卫制锻炼。在儿童中，积极提倡活动性游戏。老年、体弱的人可以做做操，打打太极拳，散散步。在民兵中，特别是基干民兵中要大力开展国防体育活动。厂矿、农村还应结合生产，大搞田间操、工间操和各种生产操。在广泛开展群众体育的同时，要千方百计地提高我国运动水平，加强训练工作，提高训练质量，不断创造新纪录、新成绩，迅速攀登世界体育运动的高峰。随着体育事业的日益发展，需要更多的体育干部。要办好体育学院、体育学校和师范学院体育系、科，还要大量举办体育干部短期训练班和各种业余体育学校。体育工作中的技术革新和技术革命运动应该得到更加广泛、深入的开展，掀起一个热潮。为完成上述任务，必须坚决依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅；实行群众路线，大搞群众运动；贯彻两条腿走路的方针，把体育运动的普及和提高紧密结合起来；围绕生产、结合生产，根据各种劳动生产的不同特点，开展多种多样的体育活动。为推动体育运动一浪接一浪地向前发展，要及时总结经验，推广经验，大插红旗，广树标兵，提倡学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的共产主义风格，动员人民参加锻炼，使体育运动更好地为人民的健康、为劳动生产和国防建设服务。
    体育运动不仅是增强人民体质的最积极有效的方法，而且是向群众进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。在开展体育运动中，必须大大发扬集体主义的革命精神，培养共产主义的道德品质，同各种资产阶级的思想作风作斗争。
    毛泽东思想是指导一切工作从胜利走向新的胜利的根本保证。为了把体育工作做得更好，广大体育工作者必须努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，加强思想改造，不断和各种资产阶级思想展开不调和的斗争，提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，树立无产阶级世界观，努力向又红又专的方向迈进。
    我们相信，随着生产的大跃进、大发展，体育运动也必然一个高潮接一个高潮，出现大普及、大提高的持续跃进的新局面。可以设想，在将来，体育运动将成为全国人民日常生活中不可缺少的一部分，经常参加体育运动的人不只是几千万，而是几万万，人民的体质将有更大的增强，年轻的一代都将是身高体大、筋骨强壮，无论作星际旅行或海底探矿都有充足的身体本钱。那时，我国的运动技术水平也会有更大的提高，我们将拥有大量的世界纪录保持者和世界冠军。中国一定会成为一个体育高度发展的国家。
    体育工作的任务是光荣的，巨大的。在实现这些任务时，先进体育工作者应该成为广大体育工作者的表率，要保持谦虚，防止骄傲自满，发扬把荣誉让给别人、把困难留给自己的共产主义风格，进一步发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，带领广大群众一起前进。
    让我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，大搞城乡体育运动，和教育、文化、卫生、新闻战线的同志们一道，为把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大社会主义强国而奋斗！为将来实现共产主义而奋斗！
