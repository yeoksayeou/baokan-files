Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 2nd. Today's editorial in the Soviet "Red Star" emphasized: "The US ruling group's destruction of the Paris conference confirms the conclusion that as long as imperialism exists, the reactionary forces representing the interests of monopoly capital will try to carry out military adventures and aggression. Therefore, we must show the utmost vigilance against the conspiracies and threats of the aggressors and do our best to strengthen the power of our socialist motherland."

The editorial said that the last layer of disguise of those who sabotaged the Paris Four-Power Summit has been torn off, and the ugly face of the American "peace lovers" has been exposed to the people of all countries. Even American bourgeois commentators admit that the so-called "leader of the free world"—the United States—feels today as if it has been stripped of its pants.

The editorial said that the US imperialists, who sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, intended to intimidate and demean the Soviet Union, and attempted to consolidate their aggressive blocs and clear the way for new war adventures. However, they miscalculated greatly. Today, it is the American aggressors themselves who are in a state of panic, discredit, embarrassment, and nervousness.

The editorial emphasized that the US government's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit has resulted in its moral and political failure. After suffering such a serious defeat, American officials are still making shameless threats against the Soviet Union, declaring military readiness, and claiming that they will continue to carry out provocations and espionage activities against the Soviet Union in the future.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. Our country steadfastly strives to resolve all disputes through negotiations. However, recent events show that the US aggressive bloc insists on pursuing a policy of sharpening the international situation and continuing to intensify the "Cold War," which cannot but arouse our vigilance.

The editorial pointed out that the US aggressors will carry out various provocations and criminal activities against the Soviet Union. Our responsibility is to prevent their surprise attacks from succeeding. In our ranks, complacency and carelessness must not be tolerated.

    苏联“红星报”评美国统治集团破坏首脑会议
    帝国主义存在一天就要进行军事侵略
    决不允许在我们队伍中有麻痹大意情绪存在
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联“红星报”今天的社论强调指出：“美国统治集团破坏了巴黎会议，从而确证了这样一个结论：即当帝国主义还存在的时候，代表垄断资本的利益的反动势力就要力图进行军事冒险和侵略活动。因此，我们必须对侵略者的阴谋和威胁表现出最大的警惕性，全力加强我们社会主义祖国的威力。”
    社论说，那些破坏巴黎四国政府首脑会议的人的最后一层伪装已经被撕下来了，美国的“和平爱好者”的丑恶面貌已经在各国人民面前暴露无遗。连美国资产阶级评论员也承认，所谓“自由世界的首领”——美国今天感到自己就像被剥掉了裤子一样。
    社论说，破坏四国政府首脑会议的美帝国主义者打算吓倒和贬低苏联，企图巩固自己的侵略集团并为新的战争冒险扫清道路，然而，他们是大大地失算了。今天处于恐慌、威信扫地、狼狈不安和神经紧张的境况的是美国侵略者自己。
    社论强调指出，美国政府破坏了四国政府首脑会议，从而使它遭到了道义上和政治上的失败。美国官方人物在遭到这样严重的失败之后，仍然对苏联进行无耻的威胁，宣布军事戒备，宣称今后还将继续对苏联进行挑衅和间谍活动。
    社论说，苏联是爱好和平的国家。我国坚定不移地争取通过谈判的途径来解决一切争端问题。但是，最近的事件表明，美国侵略集团坚持奉行使国际局势尖锐化的方针，继续加剧“冷战”，这就不能不使我们引起警惕。
    社论指出，美国侵略者是会对苏联进行各种挑衅和罪恶活动的，我们的责任是，不让他们的突然袭击得逞。在我们的队伍中，决不能容许有自安自慰和麻痹大意的情绪存在。
