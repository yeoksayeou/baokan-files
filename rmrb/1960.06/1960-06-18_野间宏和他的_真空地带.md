Noma Hiroshi and His "Vacuum Zone"
	Nankai University Chinese Department 1957 Grade Oriental Literature Group

	At a time when people all over the world are waging heroic struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and at a time when the Japanese people are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the traitorous government of Nobusuke Kishi, a delegation of Japanese writers headed by Noma Hiroshi came to our country from the forefront of this fierce struggle for a visit. We would like to take this opportunity to talk about his famous work, "Vacuum Zone".

	Noma Hiroshi is a famous progressive writer in Japan. He was born in Kobe in 1915. During his school days, he participated in the student movement and actively supported the revolutionary struggle. In 1941, after Japanese imperialism launched the Pacific War, Noma Hiroshi was conscripted into the army. During this period, due to his advanced thinking, he was considered to have "ideological problems" and was constantly monitored by the military police. Finally, in 1944, he was imprisoned as an "ideologically unsound element". During his three years in the army and in prison, he was forced to accept fascist militarist education. The cruel rule of fascism aroused his greater anger and resistance. He once said: "During the war, I always held this determination: I should write anti-war novels, especially novels that expose the army. When I was in military service, I once declared to the corporal and squad leader: 'After I am discharged from the army, I will definitely write a novel exposing the inside of the army for you to see.' Every time I was punished by them, my heart was filled with intense anger, and I secretly vowed: I cannot die until I have exposed the essence of this army!" Noma Hiroshi harbored a strong hatred for militarism. This thought and personal experience were the basis for his writing of the novel "Vacuum Zone". In 1946, he joined the Japanese Communist Party. Since then, Noma Hiroshi has more actively participated in various social struggles and revolutionary activities, and has continued to grow in the struggle, using his honed pen to wage an unyielding struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. "Vacuum Zone" is his successful work.

	"Vacuum Zone" is a novel reflecting the life of soldiers under the fascist rule in Japan. Through the unfortunate experience of a soldier, Koya, in the late stage of World War II, it thoroughly and comprehensively exposes the barbaric, cruel, and corrupt nature of the Japanese militarist army.

	Soldier Koya is an orphan. Before being conscripted into the army, he was an apprentice who had suffered all kinds of human suffering. After joining the army, he suffered all kinds of torture and humiliation. During one duty shift, because he picked up Lieutenant Hayashi's wallet and did not hand it in, he became a victim of the power struggle and mutual exclusion between Lieutenant Hayashi and another Lieutenant Nakahori. Lieutenant Hayashi believed that Koya was on Nakahori's side, so he resolutely wanted to send him to a military court for trial, in order to retaliate against and attack the Nakahori group. In this way, Koya was sent to a military court. The military court sentenced him to two years and three months in prison. He was stripped naked and locked in a dark and cold cell, and was constantly beaten, even subjected to the torture of being "wrapped in leather clothing and watered". Later, he was sent back to the army. He wanted revenge, he wanted to appeal for justice, but he was immediately transferred to the front line and sent to his death.

	The novel revolves around this incident, peeling back the layers of the dark secrets of the Japanese fascist army, exposing the cruel fascist rule of the Japanese army over its soldiers. After young people are conscripted into the army, they lose their freedom and are completely isolated from society. They are not allowed to read books or newspapers, and even sending a letter requires the officer's review. At the same time, they are forced to accept fascist education. This kind of ideological rule is maintained by inhumane corporal punishment. Soldiers can only say "Yes!" under the officers' bamboo swords, leather boots, whips, and fists! The abuse suffered by the soldiers is outrageous. In order to prevent the soldiers from resisting, the rulers create a hierarchy among the soldiers, making them hate each other and suppress each other at every level. Soldiers only hope to climb higher, so they can take revenge. The rulers use this method to shift the contradictions between the vast number of soldiers and themselves. The novel exposes and accuses how the fascist army turned young people into bestial soldiers of aggression. The novel compares the Japanese fascist army to a suffocating "vacuum zone" full of death.

	The novel also exposes the utterly corrupt nature of the Japanese fascist army. Corruption, theft, flattery, power struggles and factional infighting among officers, as well as their arrogance, debauchery, and shamelessness are rampant here. The novel also focuses on exposing the irreconcilable contradictions between the vast number of soldiers and the rulers, as well as their hatred for military life and anti-war sentiments. Koya's words represent the voices of thousands of Japanese youths. He said: "Where in the world is there a soldier who likes this kind of army?" The Japanese people deeply hate this invading army and regard them as jackals and tigers. The invading army and the war of aggression are unpopular, which is the fundamental reason for the inevitable failure of imperialism.

	"Vacuum Zone" has great significance in exposing the essence of the Japanese militarist army and the war of aggression. It was published at a time when the Japanese people were resolutely opposing the entry into force of the one-sided "peace treaty" signed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. As soon as the novel was published, it was immediately welcomed and valued by the broad masses of the Japanese people, and was recognized as one of the most outstanding works of progressive literature in Japan after the war, and was made into a movie. This novel timely and powerfully encouraged the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

	Today, in order to oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the traitorous government of Nobusuke Kishi, the Japanese people are waging an increasingly heroic struggle. Noma Hiroshi's "Vacuum Zone" still has a great role to play in helping the Japanese people further understand the essence of the fascist war of aggression and its army. It can enable the people to more clearly recognize the crimes of the Japanese militarist system, thereby strengthening the people's determination to struggle.

    野间宏和他的“真空地带”
    南开大学中文系一九五七级东方文学组
    正当全世界人民为反对美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇斗争的时候，正当日本人民为反对新日美“安全条约”与岸信介卖国政府进行英勇不屈的斗争的时候，以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团从这场激烈斗争的最前线来到我国进行访问。我们想乘此机会谈谈他的名作“真空地带”。
    野间宏是日本著名的进步作家。他于1915年诞生在神户，还在求学时代，就参加了学生运动，积极支持革命斗争。1941年，日本帝国主义发动了太平洋战争以后，野间宏被征入伍，这期间由于他思想先进而被认为有“思想问题”，始终受宪兵监视，终于在1944年被当作“思想不良分子”关进了监狱。在三年的军队和监狱生活中，他被强迫接受法西斯军国主义的教育。法西斯的残酷统治，激起了他更大的愤怒和反抗。他曾经说过：“在战争期间，我始终抱着这个决心：我应该写反战小说，尤其要写暴露军队的小说。在服兵役时，有一次我对上等兵和班长宣告说：‘等我复员后，一定写一部揭露军队内部的小说给你们看。’每当受他们的处罚时，我的心都被强烈的怒火所燃烧，我暗自发誓：没有把这个军队的实质揭露以前决不能死！”对军国主义，野间宏怀着强烈的憎恨，这种思想和亲身经验，是他写作“真空地带”这部小说的基础。1946年，他加入了日本共产党。从此以后，野间宏更加积极地参加了各种社会斗争和革命活动，并且在斗争中不断成长，用他那支经过锻炼的笔，向美日反动派进行着不屈的斗争。“真空地带”就是他的成功之作。
    “真空地带”是一部反映日本法西斯统治下士兵生活的小说。它通过第二次世界大战后期一个士兵木谷不幸的遭遇，彻底、全面地揭露了日本军国主义军队野蛮残酷、腐败透顶的本质。
    士兵木谷是一个孤儿，他在被征入伍之前是个学徒，饱尝人间的痛苦，入伍之后又受尽了摧残和侮辱。在一次值勤中，他因为拾到了军官林中尉的钱包未交，便做了林中尉和另一个中堀中尉争权夺利、排挤倾轧的牺牲品，林中尉认为木谷是中堀一方的人，便坚决要把他送交军事法庭处理，借以报复和打击中堀集团。就这样，木谷被送上了军事法庭。军事法庭判处了他两年零三个月的徒刑。他被脱光了衣服关进又黑又冷的监房，接连不断地被殴打，甚至受到“穿上‘皮裹衣’浇水”的酷刑，以后，他又被送回了军队。他要复仇，他要申冤，可是立即就被调到前线，送上了死亡的道路。
    小说就围绕着这个事件，把日本法西斯军队的黑幕一层层剥开了，揭露了日本军队对士兵残酷的法西斯统治。青年们被征入伍之后，就失去了自由，他们和社会完全隔绝开来。不准看书看报，寄一封信也要交给军官审查。同时，还要强迫接受法西斯主义的教育。这种思想统治，是用惨无人道的肉刑来维持的。士兵只能在军官的竹刀、皮靴、马鞭、拳头之下说：“是！”士兵受到的虐待是令人发指的。统治者为了防止士兵的反抗，又在士兵中制造等级界限，让他们彼此仇视，层层镇压。士兵只希望爬得更高，好去复仇。统治者用这种方法来转移广大士兵和他们之间的矛盾。小说揭露和控诉了法西斯军队怎样把青年变成了侵略军队的兽兵。小说把日本法西斯军队比做一个令人窒息、充满死亡的“真空地带”。
    小说也揭露了日本法西斯军队腐败透顶的本质。在这里盛行着贪污盗窃、钻营拍马，军官之间争权夺利、派系倾轧，以及他们的作威作福、荒淫无耻的丑恶面目。小说还着重揭露了广大士兵和统治者之间不可调和的矛盾，以及他们对军队生活的憎恶和厌战情绪。木谷的话代表了千千万万日本青年的声音。他说：“天下哪有喜欢这种军队的兵？”日本人民对这支侵略军是深恶痛绝的，把它们看做是豺狼虎豹。侵略军队和侵略战争不得人心，这正是帝国主义必然失败的根本原因。
    “真空地带”在揭露日本军国主义的军队和侵略战争的实质上，有着重大的意义。它出版的时候，正是日本人民坚决反对美日反动派签订的片面“和约”生效的时候。小说一出版，立即受到了日本广大人民的欢迎与重视，被公认为日本战后进步文学中最优秀的作品之一，并且拍成了电影。这部小说及时、有力地鼓舞了日本人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。
    今天，为了反对新日美“安全条约”和岸信介卖国政府，日本人民进行了一次比一次更加英勇的斗争。野间宏的“真空地带”对日本人民进一步地去认识法西斯的侵略战争及其军队的实质，仍然有着巨大的作用。它能使人民更加清楚地认识日本军国主义制度的罪恶，从而加强人民斗争的决心。
