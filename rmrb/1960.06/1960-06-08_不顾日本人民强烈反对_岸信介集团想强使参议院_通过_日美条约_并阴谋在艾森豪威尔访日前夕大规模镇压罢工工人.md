Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 7th: Despite the opposition of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique in Japan brazenly decided today to begin a unilateral "deliberation" in the House of Councillors on June 8th regarding the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which violates the interests of the Japanese nation and threatens Asian peace.

It is reported that Kishi Nobusuke convened a meeting this morning with leaders of the ruling party, including Masajiro Kawashima, Kenji Fukunaga, and Etsusaburo Shiina, to discuss the issue of forcibly "passing" this treaty in the House of Councillors. The meeting decided that if the Socialist Party and the Democratic Socialist Party cannot reach an agreement with the ruling party on the so-called "normalization of the Diet," the Liberal Democratic Party will begin unilaterally "deliberating" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors from June 8th, and will conduct a vote solely by the Liberal Democratic Party around the 15th or 16th. It is reported that the Kishi Nobusuke group's tactic for forcing the House of Councillors to "pass" this treaty is to first adjourn the House of Councillors for ten days, and during the recess, negotiate with the Socialist Party and the Democratic Socialist Party on the issue of "normalization of the Diet." They are attempting to use "normalization of the Diet" to deceive the people and public opinion, in order to realize their conspiracy to unilaterally "pass" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors.

However, the Socialist Party has already decided to reject this plan. At a joint meeting of both houses of parliament and a meeting of the Diet Policy Committee held by the Socialist Party this afternoon, it was decided to designate the 10th and 11th as the most important period for the struggle to prevent the "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty," and all members of parliament should remain in Tokyo and not travel elsewhere.

The meeting also decided to hold a nationwide mass demonstration against the "ratification" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the 11th.

In addition, the Japanese Democratic Socialist Party has also notified the ruling party that it does not agree to hold talks on the issue of "normalization of the Diet" for the time being.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 7th: The Kishi Nobusuke government actually decided today to carry out a large-scale suppression of workers who participated in the June 4th general strike.

The Kishi Nobusuke government convened a cabinet meeting today to study the June 4th general strike and the recent "public order" situation. It decided to "severely punish" the "relevant personnel" involved in the strike.

Because the U.S. imperialists, upon whom the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique relies, are facing strong protests from the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government is in a state of panic. It is rushing to appease its American masters, while simultaneously plotting to deprive the Japanese people of their legitimate right to demonstrate in front of the American Embassy. Ganichiro Ishihara, Chairman of the "National Public Safety Commission," said at a "consultative meeting of cabinet members responsible for public order issues" held after the cabinet meeting that during the June 4th general strike, the masses frequently demonstrated in front of the American Embassy, "which is a loss of international etiquette and should be avoided as much as possible." He stated that he would raise this issue at the National Public Safety Commission meeting and "study countermeasures."

At these two meetings, the Kishi Nobusuke government also studied the "security deployment" issues for its master Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

It is reported that the Kishi Nobusuke government's state-run railway authorities have already announced today that they will withhold wages and dismiss four thousand railway workers who participated in the June 4th general strike in order to implement suppression. Sources revealed that the state-run railway authorities are preparing to take these suppression measures within this week.

    不顾日本人民强烈反对
    岸信介集团想强使参议院“通过”日美条约
    并阴谋在艾森豪威尔访日前夕大规模镇压罢工工人
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介卖国集团不顾日本人民的反对，今天悍然决定要从8日起在参议院由执政党单独“审议”违背日本民族利益和威胁亚洲和平的日美军事同盟条约。
    据报道，岸信介今天上午召集川岛正次郎、福永健司、椎名悦三郎等执政党首脑举行会议，讨论在参议院强行“通过”这个条约的问题。会议决定，如果社会党和民主社会党不能同执政党就所谓“国会正常化”问题达成协议，自由民主党将从8日开始在参议院单独“审议”新日美“安全条约”，并在15、16日左右由自由民主党单独表决。据报道，岸信介集团强使参议院“通过”这个条约的手法是，首先使参议院休会十天，在休会期间同社会党和民主社会党洽商“国会正常化”问题。企图用“国会正常化”来欺骗人民和公众舆论，来实现它单独在参议院“通过”新“安全条约”的阴谋。
    但是，社会党已经决定拒绝接受这种方案。社会党今天下午举行的两院议员全体会议和国会对策委员会会议上决定，把10日和11日定为阻止批准新“安全条约”斗争的最重要时期，全体议员都要留在东京不外出。
    会议还决定在11日举行全国规模的反对“批准”新日美“安全条约”大游行。
    另外，日本民主社会党也通知执政党，表示暂时不同意就“国会正常化”问题举行会谈。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府今天竟然决定要对参加六·四总罢工的工人进行大规模的镇压。
    岸信介政府今天召开内阁会议，研究了六·四总罢工和最近的“治安”情况。决定“要严厉处分”罢工的“有关人员”。
    由于岸信介卖国集团依附的美帝国主义者正在受到日本人民的强烈抗议，岸信介政府惊惶万状，连忙向它的美国主子陪小心，同时阴谋剥夺日本人民向美国大使馆举行示威的正当权利。“国家安全委员会”委员长石原干市郎在内阁会议后举行的“负责治安问题阁员恳谈会”上说，在六·四总罢工的时候，群众频繁地向美国大使馆举行了示威，“这是有失国际礼节的，应当竭力避免”。他表示，将在国家公安委员会会议上提出这个问题，“研究对策”。
    岸信介政府在这两个会议上还研究了他们的主子艾森豪威尔访日时的“戒备部署”问题。
    据报道，岸信介政府的国营铁道当局已经在今天宣布要对四千名参加六·四总罢工的铁路工人扣工资、解雇，来实行镇压。有消息透露，国营铁道当局准备在本周内就要采取这些镇压措施。
