    Stone Carving on the "38th Parallel"
    Zhang Zhimin
    One: On the heroic "38th Parallel," there is a very unique sight. It is not a historical site or scenic spot, but it is a remarkable work of art. It is an extremely exquisite stone carving, a line of vigorous cursive script. Some say it is a farewell poem from the Volunteers, others say it is a gift from the People's Army to the motherland. The seven large characters are carved on the giant stone – "The Final Resting Place of American Bandits." At the foot of that giant stone lies the grave of the invaders…

    Two: The grave is nothing special, but it is world-famous. People come from thousands of miles to admire this great masterpiece. Countless photographers take pictures of it, and many painters rush to copy it. The people of China and Korea report the creative process to them.

    Three: It is said that creating such a stone carving is not a difficult task. All the stones in the world are suitable for carving this kind of epitaph. The South Koreans want to carve it in Busan, the Japanese people want to carve it on Mount Fuji. The Americans are preparing to carve it on ancient castles, and the Africans are preparing to carve it on the rocks by the sea. The people are taking action! Every country has chosen this kind of location. The people are fighting! All the people are clenching hammers and chisels.

    “三八线”上的石刻
    张志民一在英雄的“三八线”上，有一处很别致的景物。不是什么古迹名胜，但却是件了不起的艺术。那是一件极精美的石刻，一行刚劲的草书。有人说是志愿军的临别题诗，有人说是人民军给祖国的礼物。巨石上刻着七个大字，——美国强盗的归宿。在那巨石的脚下，便是侵略者的坟墓……二坟墓没有什么特别，但它闻名世界。人们千里而来，欣赏这伟大的杰作。多少摄影师为它拍照，多少画家赶来临摹。中朝两国的人民，向他们报告创作的经过。三据说搞这样的石刻，并不是什么难事。全世界所有的石块，都适于刻这种墓志。南朝鲜人要把它刻在釜山，日本人民要把它刻在富士。美洲人准备刻上古老的城堡，非洲人准备刻上海边的岩石。人民行动起来了！每个国家都选好了这种地址。人民战斗起来了！所有的人民都握紧了锤子和凿
  子。
