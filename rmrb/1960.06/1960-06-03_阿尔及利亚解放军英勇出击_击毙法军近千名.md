    新华社1日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报
  “圣战者报”5月31日发表社论，谴责美帝国主义在阿尔及利亚战争中同法国殖民者狼狈为奸。社论说，帝国主义在亚洲和非洲的侵略行动是各国人民的祸患。
    这家报纸强调说，法国从北大西洋公约组织和某些西方国家例如西德获得支持。报纸要求人民团结起来，同共同的敌人——帝国主义进行战斗。
    这家报纸说，西方国家宁愿要冷战，而不要局势缓和，以便使它们能够继续推行它们的奴役和侵略亚非各国的政策。
    社论最后说，“北非的人民密切注意国际局势的一切发展，并且从中吸取一切必要的教训。他们将不再容忍在西方赞许下在阿尔及利亚进行的屠杀。”
