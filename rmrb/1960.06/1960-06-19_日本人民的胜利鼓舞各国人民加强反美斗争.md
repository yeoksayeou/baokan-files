The Just Struggles of the People of All Countries Support Each Other
Japanese People's Victory Inspires People of All Countries to Strengthen Anti-American Struggle
Vietnam’s "People's Daily" says: The struggle of people worldwide against US imperialism will be encouraged.
Cuba’s "Hoy" says: The victory of the Japanese people will influence the anti-American struggle of the Latin American people.
"Neues Deutschland" says: West German workers should force the Bonn government to break away from dependence on the United States.
The Italian Communist Youth Federation calls on youth to stand at the forefront of the struggle to eliminate American missile bases.
France's "L'Humanité" says: Eisenhower's friends are destined to be driven off the stage of history by the people.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 17th. Vietnam's "People's Daily" today published an editorial on Kishi's forced announcement to postpone Eisenhower's visit to Japan, saying that the Japanese people's magnificent fighting spirit dealt a powerful blow to the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique and their master, US imperialism, discrediting both the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke clique.

The editorial said, "The Japanese working class and people, with their fierce actions, warned US imperialism: The Japanese people, who were once victims of US atomic bombs, will never allow US imperialism to turn Japan into a military base to launch an atomic war."

The editorial condemned the Kishi Nobusuke clique for firing on the Japanese people in order to serve their master. The editorial said: "This barbaric act of suppression fully exposes their reactionary nature."

The editorial said: "The Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique struggle is just," and "The victory of this struggle will greatly encourage the struggle movements against US imperialism and its lackeys that are sweeping Asia, Latin America, and the world."

In another commentary published by "People's Daily" today, it was pointed out that the Japanese people will never allow the evil god Eisenhower to visit Japan and bring disaster to Japan. The commentary said that the Kishi Nobusuke clique's armed suppression of the people of Tokyo on June 15th shows that Eisenhower's so-called "millions of friends" in Japan only include some hired police and hooligans, while his so-called anti-American "minority" in Japan includes millions of people.

The commentary emphasized that the momentum of the Japanese people's struggle is like a volcano shaking the entire Japan, and the Kishi Nobusuke clique and its master across the Pacific are also terrified.

Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. Cuban newspapers on the 17th published commentaries on Eisenhower being forced to postpone his visit to Japan.

"Hoy" published an editorial saying, "The situation in Japan proves that we are in the century of the death of imperialism and the freedom of the people, and that no matter how big or small the country is, as long as the unity of the whole country turns into mass action, this unity is invincible." "Hoy" said, "The President of the United States cannot go to Japan because a wave of popular movements has been set off there. Soon he will not be able to go anywhere. The people will inevitably have the last word everywhere." The newspaper pointed out, "This great victory in the Far East will inevitably affect the struggle of the people of Latin American countries against their arch-enemy, which once again shows that it is a ferocious and weak paper tiger. The great victory of Japan will encourage the people of Puerto Rico and the people of Panama - victims of American occupation and people demanding national independence. Japan's (people's) insistence on saying 'no' to the demands of imperialism is an aid to the Cuban people."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 17th. Newspapers here today all hailed the US President Eisenhower's forced cancellation of his visit to Japan as a victory for the forces of peace. The newspapers also demanded that West German workers take similar actions to force the Bonn government to break away from dependence on the United States.

"Neues Deutschland" said in an editorial that the forces of peace have won a battle, and imperialism has suffered a defeat with worldwide impact. The editorial said that there is no doubt that the Japanese people will continue to fight with the same courage and indomitable spirit until they tear up the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and regain control of their own destiny.

The editorial said: The Japanese people's inspiring actions are a reply to the American militarist warmongers. The Japanese people refuse to be the vanguard of America's dream of dominating the world, and they demand true self-determination. The editorial said: The American militarists sowed the seeds of war and have now reaped the whirlwind.

The editorial called on West German workers to take action like the Japanese people to force the Bonn government to abandon its subservience to the United States. The editorial said that it is useless for the West German power holders to pray to escape this storm. Kishi Nobusuke, Adenauer's close confidant, has already fallen into this storm, and he will certainly not be the last.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th. Rome dispatch: After hearing the news that Eisenhower was forced to postpone his "visit" to Japan, the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Youth Federation today issued a communique, congratulating the Japanese people on their victory in the struggle, and urging the Italian Communist Youth to stand at the forefront of the struggle to abolish American missile bases in Italy.

The joint meeting of the Rome Provincial Committee, the Provincial Supervisory Committee, the secretaries of various branches in the city of Rome, and the Rome Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Italian Communist Party passed a resolution expressing strong support for the Japanese people. The meeting also urged all communists in Rome to fight against the establishment of American bases in Italy.

The leading body of the Rome Provincial Council of Trade Unions also expressed full support for the Japanese people's struggle and called on workers to participate in the struggle against war provocateurs.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 17th. France’s “L'Humanité” today published Pierre Gaillard’s commentary on Eisenhower’s postponement of his visit to Japan. The commentary said, "The Japanese people have won a significant victory over US imperialism."

The commentary continued, "The vast majority of Japanese people refuse to allow their country to be dragged into the American military system in Asia."

The commentary emphasized, "The developments in Japan will have an impact not only in Asia but throughout the world." The commentary concluded that Eisenhower's remaining friends include Franco, Chiang Kai-shek, and Adenauer, and these people are also destined to be driven off the political stage.

"Libération" published a commentary saying that this "dealt a heavy blow to the already highly questionable prestige of Eisenhower and the US government." The commentary said that the decline of American prestige and the power of world opinion "will further weaken the regimes in Laos and South Vietnam."

    法国“人道报”说：艾森豪威尔的朋友注定要被人民赶出历史舞台
    新华社河内17日电　越南“人民报”今天就岸信介被迫宣布要艾森豪威尔延期访日一事发表社论说，日本人民磅礴的斗争气势对岸信介反动集团及其主子美帝国主义给予了有力的打击，使美国和岸信介集团威信扫地。
    社论说，“日本工人阶级和人民以他们猛烈的行动警告美帝国主义：曾经是美国原子弹受难者的日本人民，绝不容许美帝国主义把日本变成军事基地以发动原子战争。
    社论谴责岸信介集团为了替他们的主子效劳，竟然向日本人民开枪。社论说：“这种野蛮的镇压行为，充分暴露了他们的反动本质”。
    社论说：“日本人民反美反岸信介反动集团的斗争是正义的”，“这一斗争的胜利，将大大地鼓舞正在席卷亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各地的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争运动。”
    “人民报”今天发表的另一篇评论中指出，日本人民决不允许凶神艾森豪威尔访问日本，把灾难带到日本。评论说，岸信介集团6月15日对东京人民的武装镇压说明，艾森豪威尔所谓他在日本的“千百万朋友”，只包括一些雇佣警察和流氓，而他所谓的日本反美“少数派”，却包括有千百万人民。
    评论强调指出，日本人民斗争的气势犹如撼动着整个日本的火山，对此，岸信介集团和它在太平洋彼岸的主子也为之心惊胆战。
    新华社18日讯　古巴报纸17日就艾森豪威尔被迫推延对日本的访问发表评论。
    “今日报”发表社论说，“日本的情况证明，我们正处在帝国主义死亡和人民获得自由的世纪，国家无论大小，只要全国的团结变成群众的行动，这种团结就是不可战胜的。”“今日报”说，“美国总统去不了日本，因为那里掀起了人民运动的浪潮。不久他就会什么地方也去不成。各个地方最后讲话的都必然是人民。”报纸指出，“远东的这个巨大胜利必将影响到拉丁美洲各国人民反对他们宿敌的斗争，这个敌人再一次表明它是一只凶残同时又是虚弱的纸老虎。日本的巨大胜利必将鼓舞波多黎各人民和巴拿马人民——美国占领的受害者和要求民族独立的人民。日本（人民）坚持对帝国主义的要求说‘不’的做法对古巴人民是一种援助。”
    新华社柏林17日电　此间报纸今天都欢呼美国总统艾森豪威尔被迫取消对日本的访问是和平力量的一个胜利。报纸并要求西德的工人也采取类似的行动，来迫使波恩政府脱离对美国的依赖。
    “新德意志报”在一篇社论中说，和平力量打了一次胜仗，帝国主义遭到了具有世界影响的失败。社论说，毫无疑问，日本人民将继续以同样的勇气和不屈不挠的精神继续进行斗争，直到撕毁日美“安全条约”并使自己重新掌握自己的命运为止。
    社论说：日本人民的这种令人鼓舞的行动是对美国军国主义战争贩子的答复。日本人民拒绝充当美国梦想霸占世界的急先锋，他们要求真正的自决权。社论说：美国军国主义者播下了战争的种子，现在已收到风暴。
    社论号召西德工人也像日本人民那样采取行动，迫使波恩政府放弃对美国的屈从。社论说，西德掌权者靠祷告来逃出这场风暴是没有用的。阿登纳的心腹之交岸信介已经陷入这场风暴了，肯定的，他不会是最后一个。
    新华社17日讯　罗马消息：在听到艾森豪威尔被迫推迟他对日本的“访问”的消息后，意大利共产主义青年团书记处今天发表了一项公报，祝贺日本人民的斗争获得胜利，并且敦促意大利共产主义青年站在斗争的前列，为争取取消在意大利的美国导弹基地而斗争。
    意大利共产党罗马省委员会、省监察委员会、罗马市各支部的书记和共青团罗马省委员会的联席会议通过了一个决议，表示大力支持日本人民。会议还敦促罗马的一切共产主义者为反对在意大利设置美国基地而斗争。
    罗马省工会理事会的领导机构也表示全力支持日本人民的斗争，并且号召工人参加反对战争挑衅者的斗争。
    据新华社巴黎17日电　法国“人道报”今天就艾森豪威尔延期访日发表了皮埃尔·古达德的评论。评论说，“日本人民对美帝国主义赢得了意义重大的胜利”。
    评论接着说，“绝大多数的日本人拒绝让他们的国家被卷入美国在亚洲的军事体系”。
    评论强调指出，“日本的事态发展将不仅在亚洲，而且在全世界产生影响。”评论最后说，艾森豪威尔剩下的朋友还有佛朗哥、蒋介石、阿登纳之流，而这些人也是注定要在政治舞台上被赶走的。
      “解放报”发表评论说，这使“已经大成问题的艾森豪威尔和美国政府的声望受到沉重的打击”。评论说，美国声望的下降以及世界舆论的威力“将使老挝和南越的政权进一步削弱”。
