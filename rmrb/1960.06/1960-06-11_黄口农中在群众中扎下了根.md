Huang Kou Agricultural Middle School Has Taken Root Among the Masses
Ren Xunzhan, Representative of Huang Kou Agricultural Middle School in Xiao County, Anhui Province

Our school was founded in the spring of 1958 with only two classes, eighty students, three teachers, simple equipment, and a small scale. Now it has eight classes, three hundred and forty-six students (excluding those who graduated early), nineteen full-time teachers, and thirty-eight technicians; it has established a farm with two hundred and fifty mu of cultivated land and a livestock and poultry farm; it has established seven factories producing pesticides, fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and furfural; and it has added relatively complete teaching instruments and more than one thousand books and materials. The quality of teaching has been continuously improved. Last year, students participated in the county's unified final examination for secondary schools, and their scores caught up with the level of full-time ordinary middle schools. In terms of production, in addition to achieving complete self-sufficiency in school expenses and the living and learning expenses of teachers, students, and staff, it also turns over more than 10,000 yuan in surplus to the commune every month. In terms of scientific research, in the past two years, it has successively created advanced tools such as wheat threshers, seeders, blowers, and sweet potato slicers, as well as more than 530 kinds of products such as various pesticides and fertilizers. Teaching, production, and scientific research are integrated into one.

How does Huang Kou Agricultural Middle School closely integrate teaching, production, and scientific research?

In terms of teaching, we adhere to the principle of half-work and half-study, combining theory with practice. Agricultural knowledge courses are closely integrated with the characteristics and needs of local agricultural production, learning, teaching and applying, and serving production. In terms of time arrangement, we adopt alternating days, with eight classes divided into two groups, four classes attending classes and four classes working every day. On the day of labor, there are two hours of self-study time in the morning and evening. In terms of curriculum setting, in addition to the four courses of politics, Chinese, mathematics, and agricultural technology, professional courses are added according to production needs. For example, agricultural chemistry was added to the first grade this year, cotton cultivation, agricultural meteorology, and animal husbandry were added to the second grade, and agricultural machinery and physics are planned to be added to the third grade. In this way, students can reach the level of junior agricultural technicians after graduation. In terms of teaching methods, political classes are closely integrated with the political movements of various periods to strengthen students' socialist and communist education. Scientific and technical classes, according to the characteristics of the disciplines, adopt a combination of classroom teaching and on-site teaching, field teaching, and a combination of learning theoretical knowledge and summarizing production experience. For example, explain the principles of fertilizer preparation in the fertilizer factory, and explain corn artificial pollination and cotton cultivation techniques in the field, while explaining and doing it. When teaching the "soil structure" section in the agricultural technology class, the teacher took the students to the field to collect various soils and explained the characteristics of these soils on the spot. Since most of the local land is alkaline land, a detailed analysis of the alkaline land was made, so that students knew that the main reason why this kind of soil does not grow seedlings is that it contains too much alkali. After class, under the leadership of the school, a soil survey team was organized to participate in the soil census of the commune and carry out scientific research activities to "turn alkaline land into fertile land." As a result, soil replacement, deep plowing, flushing, and acid-base combination and other alkaline improvement methods were successfully tested, which promoted the development of soil improvement work in the whole commune. School teachers and students have used the agricultural scientific knowledge they have learned to summarize the high-yield experiences of local cotton, rice, Chinese cabbage, etc., and compiled "Cotton Cultivation Technology," "Rice Seedling Raising," and "Chinese Cabbage Cultivation Method" as supplementary teaching materials. In addition, agricultural labor models were invited to give lectures at the school, and students were sent to state-owned farms and other relevant units to learn advanced technologies. The adoption of these teaching methods not only has good learning effects, consolidates and develops the knowledge learned by students, and improves the quality of teaching, but also directly promotes production and scientific research.

In terms of production, establish a production base and combine production with internship and scientific experiments. At the beginning of the school's establishment, due to the lack of a fixed production base, production could not be carried out in a planned way, and learning and scientific research lacked experimental sites. After the school set up farms, breeding farms and factories, agriculture and industrial production have fixed bases. The school's agricultural production, like the commune, focuses on grain and cotton, and industrial production mainly serves the commune's agriculture. As a production unit of the commune, the school completes production tasks under the unified plan of the commune. At the same time, teachers and students conduct teaching internships and scientific research on their own production bases. For example, when learning the advanced experience of Sun Jinghou, a national labor model, in hoeing cotton roots on cloudy days to prevent cotton bolls from falling off, after learning, students applied this experience in cotton production, which not only increased production, but also powerfully broke the doubts and concerns of some people at that time, so that this advanced experience was quickly promoted throughout the commune. Another example is the method of improving alkaline soil mentioned above. The school also first implemented it on its own farm and improved 200 mu of alkaline land. This not only set an example for the entire commune, but also verified and developed the research results obtained in production labor.

In terms of scientific research, on the one hand, it combines the needs of production within the school, producing what it produces, and researching what it researches, and uses new scientific and technologies to guide production; on the other hand, it is based on the needs of commune production and solves key problems that urgently need to be solved in commune production. In the summer of 1958, cotton pests seriously threatened the bumper harvest of cotton in Huang Kou Commune. It was impossible to buy pesticides from the cities near Huang Kou Commune for a while, and even if some were bought, they could not meet the needs. In the face of this situation, the school timely carried out research on the prevention and control of cotton diseases and insect pests. After many experiments, it finally took local materials and used croton and other native medicines to make "311" pesticides. According to the appraisal of the East China Scientific Research Institute, the insecticide rate of this pesticide is 10% higher than that of "666." In the past year, the school has also used various local poisonous wild plants to make 97 kinds of pesticides. Among them, the insecticidal efficiency of the two pesticides, native "666" and "9099," is higher than that of the "222 emulsion" produced by foreign methods, and they can prevent and control all cotton pests. Huang Kou Commune is a crop area that combines grain and cotton production. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, the school has researched and manufactured fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers suitable for various crops to supply the needs of commune production. In the past year alone, 172 kinds of fertilizers were trial-produced, among which the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium mixed fertilizer made of saltpeter water, grass ash, bone meal, etc. has very high fertilizer efficiency, and one catty can be worth ten catties of human manure. In order to help the commune improve labor productivity and save labor, the school has vigorously carried out research on the transformation of tools. In the past two years, a total of 21 new tools have been created, reformed, and imitated. Among them, the sweet potato grinder reformed from the cotton gin is 40 times more efficient than ordinary stone mills. In order to find out the cultivation methods of various plants suitable for the natural conditions in the Huang Kou area, starting from November last year, the school farm established various small hill comparison experiment gardens, and conducted comprehensive research on the water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, protection, density, and management of crops such as cotton, sweet potatoes, wheat, rice, and corn. Such research work has not only promoted school production and commune production, but also enriched teaching content.

Trained technical talents in a faster, better and more economical way.

Running agricultural middle schools by integrating the three aspects of teaching, production and scientific research, and closely combining teaching, production and scientific research, has shown great benefits in two years of practice, and has trained a large number of talents in a faster, better and more economical way, promoting the great development of production.

Due to the three combinations, students are both producers and scientific researchers, so it is easier to achieve both red and expert, both socialist and communist consciousness, and more complete knowledge, and to be able to write and fight. Last year, according to the needs of the commune, our school selected 298 outstanding students to graduate early and sent them to the commune to take up various technical jobs. These students are generally competent for the work assigned to them by the commune, and some have made outstanding achievements. For example, Li Zhiying, an agricultural technician in Dingzhai Brigade, used the knowledge she learned in school and adopted new cultivation methods to manage crops, creating a high yield of 12,000 catties per mu of sweet potatoes and 1,500 catties of seed cotton. She also often goes deep into the production team to impart production technology and study production technology with the commune members. Due to her responsible work, she has been promoted to deputy captain of the women's brigade and honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Another example is Li Lechao, who is in charge of drainage and irrigation. During the drought last year, he was responsible for irrigating 30,000 mu of rice fields in Yangzhuang Brigade. Due to his skilled technology and active work, he completed the task and ensured a bumper harvest. He has been rated as an expert in drainage and irrigation in the county. In addition to sending this group of students to the commune, our school also held four short-term training courses on pesticides and fertilizers, training 378 cadres for the commune to manufacture pesticides and fertilizers. Now, in Huang Kou Commune, when people talk about agricultural middle schools, they often give a thumbs up and praise: "Agricultural middle school, agricultural middle school, both civil and military are proficient."

Due to the three combinations, the school has played a great role in production. In the past, there was a great contradiction between young people over the age of ten in rural areas going to school and production. Although the situation has changed with the implementation of general half-work and half-study, it still has some impact on production. With the establishment of production bases and the development of scientific research, the situation is very different. The school not only plays the role of an ordinary production team, but also becomes the commune's experimental field, playing the role of guiding and promoting production throughout the commune. Last year, the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the Huang Kou Agricultural Middle School farm was 1,100 catties, the average yield of rice per mu was more than 1,300 catties, and the yield of wheat per mu was more than twice the average yield of the commune production team. In industry, 950,000 catties of native pesticides were produced for the commune last year, and more than 80% of the diseases and insect pests of 60,000 mu of wheat and 70,000 mu of cotton in the commune were controlled by native pesticides manufactured by the agricultural middle school; more than 11 million catties of fertilizers and 3 million catties of bacterial fertilizers were produced, which basically met the needs of 150,000 mu of cultivated land in the commune. Last year, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our school reached more than 850,000 yuan, and the average per teacher, staff member, and student reached more than 2,000 yuan. If we estimate the role played by the school's scientific research results and the manufactured pesticides and fertilizers in the commune's production, the achievements will be even greater. Therefore, the masses now love this school very much. They sing: "The commune has set up a new school, studying, farming, and running factories, doing all kinds of farm work, all new tricks, cotton grows like peach trees, rice ears are better than sorghum, half-work and half-study has great benefits, all thanks to Chairman Mao's good policies."

    黄口农中在群众中扎下了根
    安徽省萧县黄口农业中学代表　任训赞
    我们学校在1958年春天创办时，只有两个班，八十个学生，三位教师，设备简陋，规模很小。现在已有八个班，三百四十六个学生（不包括提前结业的），十九个专职教师，三十八个技术工人；建立了拥有二百五十亩耕地的农场和一个家畜家禽饲养场；兴办了农药、化肥、菌肥、糠醛等七个工厂；添设了较完备的教学仪器和图书资料一千多册。教学质量不断提高，学生去年参加全县中等学校期终统一考试，成绩赶上了全日制普通中学的水平。在生产上，除做到学校经费和师生员工生活、学习费用全部自给外，还每月向公社上缴盈余一万多元。在科学研究上，两年来先后创制了小麦脱粒机、播种机、鼓风机、红芋切片机等先进工具，以及各种农药、化肥等产品五百三十余种。教学、生产、科学研究三位一体
    黄口农业中学是怎样把教学、生产、科学研究三者密切结合起来的呢？
    在教学方面，坚持半工半读，理论与实际相结合，农业知识课紧密结合当地农业生产的特点和需要，边教边学边用，为生产服务。时间安排上，采取隔日轮流，八个班分两批，每天四个班上课，四个班劳动，在轮着劳动的那一天，早晚有两小时自学时间。课程设置上，除政治、语文、数学、农技四门功课外，根据生产需要增设专业课，例如今年初一增加了农业化学，初二增加了棉花栽培、农业气象、动物饲养，到初三时打算再增加农业机械和物理等课程。这样学生毕业后就可以达到初级农业技术员的水平。教学方法上，政治课紧密结合各个时期的政治运动，加强对学生的社会主义和共产主义教育。科学技术课根据学科特点，采取课堂教学与现场教学、田间教学相结合，学习理论知识与总结生产经验相结合。如在化肥厂讲授化肥配制原理，在田头讲玉米人工授粉、棉花栽培技术，一边讲解，一边做。在农业技术课讲到“土壤结构”一节时，教师把学生带到野外，搜集各种土壤，当场讲解这些土壤的特性，当地土地以碱地为多，着重对碱地作了详细的分析，使学生知道这种土壤不立苗的主要原因就是含碱过多。课后在学校的领导下，又组织土壤调查小组，参加本社的土壤普查，开展“变碱地为良田”的科学研究活动，结果试验成功了换土、深翻、冲洗、酸碱化合等改碱方法，促进了全社的土壤改良工作的开展。学校师生曾运用学到的农业科学知识，总结了当地棉花、水稻、大白菜等的丰产经验，编写了“棉花栽培技术”、“水稻育秧”、“大白菜栽培法”等作为补充教材。此外，还请农业劳动模范到学校讲课，派学生到国营农场和其他有关单位学习，以学习先进技术。采用以上这些教学方法，不但学习效果好，使学生所学到的知识得到巩固和发展，提高了教学质量，而且直接推动了生产和科学研究工作。
    在生产方面，建立生产基地，把生产和实习、科学试验结合起来。学校开办之初，由于没有固定的生产基地，生产不能有计划进行，学习和科学研究也缺乏实验场所。学校办起农场、饲养场和工厂后，农业、工业生产都有了固定的基地。学校农业生产和公社一样以粮棉为主，工业生产以为公社农业服务为主。学校作为公社的生产单位，在公社的统一计划下完成生产任务。同时，学校师生在自己的生产基地上进行教学实习，开展科学研究。例如在学习全国劳动模范孙景厚阴天锄棉根，防止棉铃脱落的先进经验时，学生学习后，就在棉花生产中运用这一经验，结果既增了产，又有力地打破了当时有些人的怀疑和顾虑，使这种先进经验在全社范围内很快得到了推广。又如前面所说的改良碱土的方法，学校也首先在自己农场里实行，把二百亩碱土地改好了，这样既为全社做出了榜样，又在生产劳动中验证和发展了所获得的研究成果。
    在科学研究方面，一方面结合校内生产的需要，生产什么，研究什么，以新的科学技术指导生产；一方面根据公社生产的需要，解决公社生产中急待解决的关键问题。1958年夏季，棉花虫害严重威胁着黄口公社棉花大丰收，从黄口公社附近的城市一时买不到农药，就是买到一些也满足不了需要，面对这一情况，学校及时开展了棉花病虫害防治的研究，经过多次试验，终于就地取材，利用人言、巴豆等土药，制成了“三一一”农药。经华东科学研究所鉴定，这种农药的杀虫率比“六六六”还高10％。去年一年中，学校又利用当地各种有毒野生植物，制成农药九十七种，其中土“六六六”和“九○九九”两种农药，经试验，杀虫效率比洋法生产的“二二二乳剂”还高，可以防治棉花的一切虫害。黄口公社是粮棉兼产的作物区，为了解决肥料问题，学校研究和制造了适合各种作物的化肥和细菌肥，供应公社生产的需要。去年一年就试制了化肥一百七十二种，其中用硝老水、草灰、骨粉等制成的氮、磷、钾混合肥料，肥效很高，一斤可抵上十斤人粪。为了帮助公社提高劳动生产率，节约劳动力，学校大搞改造工具的研究工作，两年来共创制、改制、仿制新工具二十一种，其中用弹花机改制的山芋磨粉机，比普通石磨提高工效四十倍。为了找出适合黄口地区自然条件的各种植物栽培方法，从去年11月开始，学校农场建立了各种小丘对比实验园地，对棉花、山芋、小麦、水稻、玉米等作物的水、肥、土、种、保、密、管，进行了全面的研究。这样的开展研究工作，结果既促进了学校生产和公社生产，又丰富了教学内容。
    多快好省地培养了技术人材
    用三位一体的方法办农业中学，把教学、生产和科学研究密切结合起来，在两年的实践中，已显示出极大的好处，多快好省地培养出了大批人材，推动了生产大发展。
    由于三结合，学生是生产者，又是科学研究人员，所以比较易于达到又红又专，既有社会主义和共产主义觉悟，又有较完全的知识，能文能武。去年根据公社的需要，我们学校挑选了二百九十八名优秀的学生提早结业，输送给公社担任各种技术工作。这些学生一般都能胜任公社分配给他们的工作，有的已做出了出色的成绩。如在丁寨大队当农业技术员的李志英，运用在学校所学得的知识，采取新的栽培方法管理作物，创造了亩产山芋一万二千斤，籽棉一千五百斤的高产成绩。她还经常深入到生产队传授生产技术，和社员们一起钻研生产技术。由于工作负责，已被提拔为妇女大队副，并光荣地加入了中国共产党。又如担任排灌机手的李乐超，去年大旱时，他负责杨庄大队三万亩稻田的灌溉，由于技术熟练，工作积极，完成了任务，保证了丰收，已被评为全县排灌能手。除了向公社输送了这批学生以外，我们学校还举办了四期农药、化肥短期训练班，为公社培训了三百七十八名制造农药、化肥的干部。现在在黄口公社，谈起农业中学，人们常常会竖起大拇指称赞说：“农中农中，文武皆通”。
  由于三结合，使学校在生产中发挥了很大作用。过去，农村里十几岁以上的青年人进学校读书，和生产有很大矛盾。实行一般的半工半读，情况虽然有改变，但对生产总有些影响。建立了生产基地，开展了科学研究，情况就大不同了，学校不仅起了一个普通生产队的作用，而且成为公社的试验田，发挥指导、推动全社生产的作用。黄口农中的农场，去年棉花平均亩产籽棉一千一百斤，水稻平均亩产一千三百多斤，小麦亩产比公社生产队平均产量高一倍以上。工业上去年为公社生产土农药九十五万斤，全社六万亩小麦、七万亩棉花的病虫害，80％以上是用农中制造的土农药防治的；生产化肥一千一百多万斤，细菌肥三百万斤，基本满足了全社十五万亩耕地的需要。去年我们学校工农业总产值达八十五万多元，教职员工、学生平均每人达两千多元。如果把学校的科学研究成果和制造的农药、肥料，对公社生产所起的作用估计进去，成绩就更大了。所以群众现在非常喜爱这所学校，他们歌颂说：“公社办起新学校，读书种田办工厂，庄稼活儿样样会，全是搞的新花样，棉花长的像桃树，稻子穗儿赛高粱，半工半读好处大，都是毛主席的好主张。”
