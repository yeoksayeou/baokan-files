Zhang Jichun said in his closing address that class struggle must be carried out in the ideological field, and the revolution of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology should be continued in depth.
Twenty-eight delegations, more than 3,000 advanced units, more than 2,000 advanced workers, and specially invited representatives were awarded prizes.
Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: The National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and News concluded victoriously this afternoon after lasting eleven days.

Zhang Jichun, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Cultural and Educational Office of the State Council, said in his closing address to the congress that this congress was conducted under the direct leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The congress has achieved its intended goals and successfully completed its tasks.

Zhang Jichun said: "Now, comrades, you are about to return to your respective posts with the glorious missions entrusted by the Party and the country, with the revolutionary spirit of the congress, and with the advanced ideas and experiences you have learned, and throw yourselves into new battles. It is fully foreseeable that, under the leadership of the Party, by giving play to the leading role, backbone role, and bridging role of advanced workers, and through the active efforts of all cultural and educational workers and the people of the whole country, a new climax will soon appear in our country's cultural revolution."

The closing ceremony of the congress was held at 3:30 PM. Lin Feng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Jichun, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Cultural and Educational Office of the State Council, and Wu Yuzhang, Yang Xiufeng, Shen Yanbing, Li Dequan, Zhou Yang, Qian Junrui and other responsible persons of cultural and educational departments attended today's closing ceremony.

Also attending the closing ceremony were Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, and He Xiangning, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Xu Teli, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council, and General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The closing ceremony of the congress was presided over by Zhou Yang, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Xu Maijin, Secretary-General of the congress, announced to the representatives: During the congress, 2,614 congratulatory letters and telegrams and 88 good news reports were received from grassroots cultural and educational units, industrial and mining enterprises, and people's communes across the country. All the representatives expressed their gratitude and support to the people of various places for their concern and support for this congress with warm applause.

Subsequently, more than 6,000 representatives unanimously adopted the congratulatory telegram from the congress to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao (full text to be issued separately).

At today's closing ceremony, Comrade Lin Feng presented awards to the representatives on behalf of the congress. Twenty-eight delegations from provinces, cities, autonomous regions, central organs, and the People's Liberation Army each received a red flag. The 3,092 advanced units attending the congress all received certificates of merit, and 2,714 advanced workers and 260 specially invited representatives received prizes such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The flags and certificates were respectively printed with the four characters "Advanced Unit" written by Premier Zhou Enlai and General Secretary Deng Xiaoping of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The award ceremony was held in the melodious music of "Ode to the Motherland", and rhythmic applause resounded throughout the venue from beginning to end. Afterwards, Zhang Jichun delivered a closing speech. He said that we must firmly remember the instructions of the Party Central Committee, carry out class struggle in the ideological field, and continue to deepen the revolution of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology". If we forget this, our cultural and educational work will lose its soul. Zhang Jichun said that the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is the last life-and-death class struggle in human history. As long as the bourgeoisie and its remnants and influences have not been completely eliminated throughout the world, the class struggle will not be extinguished. Anyone who denies this is violating the most basic common sense of Marxism-Leninism and violating the most fundamental law of the unity and struggle of opposites.

Zhang Jichun said that in the international arena, opposing imperialism, especially US imperialism, is our long-term and serious task. We must expose the aggressive and reactionary nature of US imperialism, expose its peaceful deception and war conspiracies, and resolutely struggle against the so-called "Western civilization" and the American way of life that imperialists are doing their best to spread, which are used to paralyze and poison the people of the world, in front of the people of the world.

Zhang Jichun pointed out that thoroughly exposing the traitorous face of modern revisionism that serves imperialism, eliminating the ideological toxins they spread, safeguarding the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism, arming the proletariat and working people of the world with the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and striving for the complete victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause is the lofty historical mission of our generation of communists.

Zhang Jichun finally said that we must forever strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we must forever be loyal to the cause of the liberation of the world proletariat, loyal to the cause of the liberation of oppressed nations, and always stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, and unyieldingly fight to promote the cause of world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism for the people of all countries.

After Zhang Jichun's speech, the congress concluded victoriously at 4:10 PM in the music of "Socialism is Good". (Picture attached)

    高举毛泽东思想红旗把文化革命推向新的高潮
    全国文教群英大会胜利闭幕
    张际春致闭幕词说，要在意识形态领域里进行阶级斗争，继续深入兴无灭资的革命
    二十八个代表团、三千多个先进单位、二千多个先进工作者和特邀代表分别受奖
    新华社11日讯　全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会历时十一天，今天下午胜利闭幕。
    中共中央委员、国务院文教办公室主任张际春在向大会致闭幕词时说，这次大会是在党中央和国务院直接领导和关怀下进行的。大会已经达到了预定的目的，胜利地完成了任务。
    张际春说：“现在，同志们就要带着党和国家所给予的光荣任务，带着大会的革命精神，带着学习到的先进思想和先进经验，回到各自的工作岗位，投入新的战斗了。完全可以预料，在党的领导下，发挥先进工作者的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，通过全体文化教育工作者和全国人民的积极努力，我国文化革命一定会很快出现一个新的高潮。”
    大会闭幕式是在下午三时半举行的。中共中央委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫、中共中央委员、国务院文教办公室主任张际春和文教各部门负责人吴玉章、杨秀峰、沈雁冰、李德全、周扬、钱俊瑞等出席了今天的闭幕式。
    出席闭幕式的还有人大常委会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、何香凝，人大常委会委员徐特立，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将。
    大会闭幕式由中共中央候补委员、中共中央宣传部副部长周扬主持。
    大会秘书长徐迈进向代表们宣布：在大会期间，收到全国文教基层单位、工矿企业和人民公社发来的贺信、贺电二千六百一十四件，喜报八十八件。全体代表以热烈的掌声表示感谢各地人民对这次大会的关怀和支持。
    接着，六千多名代表一致通过了大会向中共中央和毛主席的致敬电（全文另发）。
    在今天的闭幕式上，林枫同志代表大会向代表们发奖。二十八个省、市、自治区和中央机关以及解放军部队的代表团各领到一面红旗。出席大会的三千零九十二个先进单位都领到了奖状，二千七百一十四个先进工作者和二百六十个特邀代表领到了毛泽东选集等奖品。奖旗和奖状上分别印着周恩来总理和中共中央总书记邓小平同志题写的“先进单位”四个大字。发奖的仪式在悠扬的“歌唱祖国”的乐曲声中进行，全场自始至终响着有节奏的掌声。接着，张际春致闭幕词。他说，我们要牢牢记住党中央的指示，在意识形态领域里进行阶级斗争，继续深入“兴无灭资”的革命。如果忘记了这一点，我们的文化教育工作就失去了灵魂。张际春说，资产阶级和无产阶级之间的阶级斗争，是人类历史上最后的一场你死我活的阶级斗争。只要全世界还没有彻底消灭资产阶级及其残余和影响，阶级斗争就不会熄灭。谁要否认这一点，谁就是违背马克思列宁主义最起码的常识，违背对立面的统一和斗争这个最根本的规律。
    张际春说，在国际范围内，反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是我们长期的严重的任务。我们必须在全世界人民面前，揭露美帝国主义的侵略和反动本质，揭露它的和平欺骗和战争阴谋，同帝国主义者极力散布的、用来麻痹和毒化全世界人民的所谓“西方文明”以及美国生活方式进行坚决的斗争。
    张际春指出，彻底揭露现代修正主义为帝国主义效劳的叛徒嘴脸，清除他们所散布的思想毒素，保卫马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂，用马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说武装全世界无产阶级和劳动人民，争取无产阶级革命事业的彻底胜利，是我们这一代的共产主义者崇高的历史使命。
    张际春最后说，我们要永远加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，要永远忠实于世界无产阶级的解放事业，忠实于被压迫民族的解放事业，始终如一地站在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争的最前列，不屈不挠地为推进各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的事业而坚决斗争。
    在张际春致词以后，下午四时十分，大会在“社会主义好”的乐曲声中胜利闭幕。（附图片）
