The Plague God Crosses the Street

Eight, although Mount Fuji is near, it can only be seen from the air; the city of Tokyo can only be sought in dreams. In an instant, the plane flies past, as if I still see the shadow of the red flag, as if I still hear the roar of anger. You lackey with the surname of Kish*, ah, do you know my mood at this moment? Seeing it so close, yet so far, how can it not break my heart, how can it not break my heart!

Dongfang Jian Poem Fang Cheng Painting (with picture)

*Note: "那岸姓的奴才" refers to Nobusuke Kishi, then Prime Minister of Japan, who was seen as a puppet of the US and thus a "lackey".

    瘟神过街八、咫尺天涯富士山只好空中看，东京城只好梦中寻。一霎时飞机过也，仿佛犹见红旗影，仿佛犹闻怒吼声。那岸姓的奴才啊，你可知我此时心境？眼看得咫尺天涯，怎不叫人心痛，怎不叫人心痛！东方剑诗　方成　画（附图片）
