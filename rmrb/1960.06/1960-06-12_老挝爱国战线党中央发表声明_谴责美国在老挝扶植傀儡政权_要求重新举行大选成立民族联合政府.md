Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 11th: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on June 6th, sternly condemning the reactionary clique of Phoumi Nosavan and Chao Somsanith, the running dogs of the United States in Laos, for recently forming a reactionary government that serves as the most effective tool of US imperialism. The statement demands new general elections and the formation of a national united government to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

The statement, published by "Lao Patriotic News" on June 6th, points out that the Phoumi Nosavan and Chao Somsanith clique has seized a majority of seats in the National Assembly and monopolized the power in the government. This will allow them to implement an extremely militaristic policy more brutally and frantically, completely destroy the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and abolish all democratic freedoms, plunging the Lao people into greater suffering.

The statement exposes the Chao Somsanith government's so-called "Pacification Plan" as actually a plan to continue expanding the civil war and persecuting patriots; the so-called "Rural Consolidation Plan" as actually a plan to carry out village mergers and force people to leave their homes; and the so-called "Plan to Increase National Income" as actually a plan to increase taxes, making the already impoverished Lao people even poorer.

The statement says that faced with the malicious conspiracies of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan and Chao Somsanith clique that are seriously threatening the motherland, the Lao Patriotic Front, representing the wishes of all Lao people, once again clarifies its following position:

(1) Sternly condemn the dictatorial and fraudulent general election, and oppose the establishment of a reactionary government controlled by the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and the heads of the People's Social Party—the Phoumi Nosavan and Chao Somsanith clique. Demand that new general elections be held strictly in accordance with the principles of freedom and democracy stipulated in the Constitution to elect a National Assembly with a national and democratic nature, and establish a national united government to implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and pursue a genuine policy of peace and neutrality.

(2) The policy line of the Lao Patriotic Front will not change in the slightest due to the escape from prison of Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee, and other leaders and cadres of the party. Contrary to the distorted propaganda of US imperialism and its running dogs, the Lao Patriotic Front has always been loyal to the interests of the nation and the people, and has consistently pursued a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, so as to free the motherland from the enslavement of US imperialism and resolutely safeguard national harmony.

The Lao Patriotic Front believes that in order to stop the civil war and promote the normalization of the situation, both sides must earnestly meet and consult on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

The statement, in discussing the issue of Prince Souphanouvong's escape from prison, points out that the Phoumi Nosavan and Chao Somsanith clique had shamelessly illegally imprisoned Prince Souphanouvong and other members of parliament and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front for more than ten months, and had painstakingly attempted to accuse and frame them.

The statement says that thanks to the unremitting struggle of the people throughout the country and the help of officers and soldiers of the Royal Army guarding the prison, Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front escaped from prison. The statement says that this is a major victory for the people of our country, and all patriotic and peace-loving Lao people are rejoiced by it. At the same time, it is a heavy defeat for US imperialism and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

    老挝爱国战线党中央发表声明
    谴责美国在老挝扶植傀儡政权
    要求重新举行大选成立民族联合政府
    新华社河内11日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会6月6日发表声明，严厉谴责美国在老挝的走狗富米·诺萨万、昭·松萨尼特集团最近组成的反动政府充当美帝国主义最得力的工具。声明要求重新举行大选，成立民族联合政府，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    “老挝爱国新闻”6月6日刊载的这篇声明指出，富米·诺萨万、昭·松萨尼特集团占据了国会的多数席位，把持了政府中的独断权，这样他们将更加残暴、更加疯狂地实行极端黩武政策，彻底破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，并取消一切民主自由权利，使老挝人民陷入更大的痛苦。
    声明揭露昭·松萨尼特政府制定的所谓“安宁计划”，实际上是继续扩大内战和迫害爱国者的计划；所谓“巩固农村计划”，实际上是进行并村、强迫人民离乡背井的计划；所谓“增加国家收入的计划”；实际上是增加赋税的计划，使已经贫穷的老挝人更加贫穷。
    声明说，面对着美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万、昭·松萨尼特集团的恶毒阴谋正在严重地威胁着祖国这种情况，老挝爱国战线党代表全体老挝人民的愿望，再一次阐明自己的下述立场：
    （一）严厉谴责独裁的欺诈的大选，反对成立由“保卫国家利益委员会”和人民社会党头目们——富米·诺萨万、昭·松萨尼特集团把持的反动政府。要求严正地按照宪法规定的自由民主原则，来重新举行大选，选出具有民族、民主性质的国会，成立民族联合政府、以履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，奉行真正的和平中立政策。
    （二）老挝爱国战线党的政策路线，并不因为中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王以及党的其他领导人和干部脱狱而有丝毫的改变。同美帝国主义及其走狗的歪曲宣传相反，老挝爱国战线党一贯忠诚于民族和人民的利益，始终不渝地奉行真正的和平中立政策，以使祖国摆脱美帝国主义的奴役，并坚决维护民族和睦。
    老挝爱国战线党认为，为了制止内战，促使局势正常化，双方必须严正地在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上进行会晤和协商。
    声明在谈到苏发努冯亲王等越狱的问题时指出，富米·诺萨万、昭·松萨尼特集团曾经无耻地把苏发努冯亲王以及老挝爱国战线党其他议员和干部非法监禁了十个多月，并曾经煞费心机地企图加罪和陷害他们。
    声明说，由于全国人民不懈的斗争和看守监狱的王国军队官兵们的帮助，苏发努冯亲王以及老挝爱国战线党其他领导人和干部逃出了监狱。声明说，这是我国人民的重大胜利，所有爱国、爱和平的老挝人都为之欢欣鼓舞，这同时是美帝国主义和“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们的沉重失败。
