Xinhua News Agency, June 15th, Tokyo dispatch: Over two thousand Korean residents in Tokyo, Japan, held a rally today to oppose Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea and demanded severe punishment for the traitor Syngman Rhee.

　　The rally was hosted by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.

　　Chairman Han Dok-su of the General Association pointed out at the rally that Eisenhower's trip to South Korea aimed to boost the morale of the new puppet Huh Chung group, stabilize the increasingly collapsing colonial rule of US imperialism there, and further prepare to launch a new war. Han Dok-su pointed out that US imperialism allowed Syngman Rhee, the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean nation, to escape to Hawaii because it feared that its war policies and colonial policies would be further exposed when Syngman Rhee was judged by the people.

　　The rally unanimously passed a resolution firmly opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea. It also demanded that the United States immediately hand over the traitor Syngman Rhee to the Korean people for trial; and demanded the immediate arrest and punishment of all members of the Huh Chung group who helped Syngman Rhee escape.

　　The rally passed a letter to Premier Kim Il-sung amidst enthusiastic applause. The letter stated that Korean residents in Japan would unite and fight to the end to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

　　The rally also passed letters of protest to the Huh Chung group and Eisenhower.

　　Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan-Korea Association, and various Japanese mass organizations were invited to address the meeting. They unanimously stated that the Japanese people would unite with the Korean people and fight their common enemy to the end.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 15th: Seoul dispatch: The struggle of the South Korean people from all walks of life against US imperialism and its lackeys is becoming increasingly high.

　　According to Tonghwa News Agency, this morning, when the South Korean puppet "National Assembly" was passing a "revised constitution bill" to deceive the people, hundreds of people held a demonstration in front of the "National Assembly Building." The demonstrators shouted slogans: "The unqualified National Assembly should be dissolved immediately!"

　　According to a broadcast by Daegu Radio Station, more than three thousand farmers in the suburbs of Daegu City held a rally on the afternoon of the 14th, demanding that the US invading army authorities forcibly occupying South Korea immediately compensate for the 130 "jeongbo" (one "jeongbo" equals fifteen Chinese mu) of farmland requisitioned by the United States. At the rally, the farmers decided to submit a written request to the relevant authorities. If the relevant authorities did not accept the request, they would continue to launch a struggle. According to reports, the farmers, having been deprived of their land, have repeatedly demanded that the relevant authorities at least compensate them 3.9 billion hwan, but their requests have been unreasonably rejected every time.

    反对艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜
    旅日朝侨集会谴责美国包庇卖国贼李承晚
    大丘市郊农民集会要求美军赔偿占用土地
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：住在日本东京的两千多名朝鲜侨民今天举行大会，反对艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜，并且要求严惩卖国贼李承晚。
    大会是由旅日朝鲜人总联合会主持的。
    总联合会议长韩德铢在大会上指出，艾森豪威尔这次南朝鲜之行其目的在于给新傀儡许政集团打气，稳定在那里日益趋向崩溃的美帝国主义的殖民统治，并进一步准备发动新的战争。韩德铢指出，美帝国主义使朝鲜民族不共戴天的死敌李承晚逃到夏威夷去，是它害怕在李承晚受到人民的审判时，它的战争政策和殖民政策会更加暴露出来。
    大会一致通过决议，坚决反对艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜。并且要求美国立即把卖国贼李承晚交给朝鲜人民审判；要求立即逮捕和惩办帮助李承晚逃走的许政集团全体人员。
    大会在热烈掌声中通过给金日成首相的信。信中表示，旅日朝侨将团结起来，为争取和平统一祖国而斗争到底。
    大会还通过给许政集团和艾森豪威尔的抗议书。
    日本共产党代表、日朝协会和日本各群众团体的代表应邀在会上致词。他们一致表示，日本人民将同朝鲜人民联合起来，对共同敌人进行斗争到底。
    据新华社平壤15日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争更加日益高涨。
    据同和通讯社报道，今天上午，南朝鲜伪“国会”正在通过欺骗人民的“修改宪法案”的时候，数百名群众在“国会议事堂”前举行示威。示威群众高呼口号：“没有资格的国会立即解散！”。
    据大丘广播电台广播，大丘市郊区的三千多农民14日下午举行大会，要求强占在南朝鲜的美国侵略军当局立即对美国征用的一百三十町步（一町步合十五市亩）耕地进行赔偿。在大会上，农民们决定向有关当局提出书面要求。如果有关当局不接受要求，就继续展开斗争。据报道，农民们由于被剥夺了土地，曾一再要求有关当局起码赔偿三十九亿圜，但是他们每一次的要求都遭到了无理拒绝。
