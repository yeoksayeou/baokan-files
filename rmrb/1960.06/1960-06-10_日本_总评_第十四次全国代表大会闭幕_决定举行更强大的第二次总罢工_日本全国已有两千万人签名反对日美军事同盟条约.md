Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sōhyō") successfully concluded its 14th National Convention today. The action plan unanimously adopted by the convention stipulates that "Sōhyō" will hold an even stronger second national general strike on the 15th, demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the overthrow of the Kishi Cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet.

    On the day of the general strike on the 15th, workers in private enterprises will hold a 24-hour strike, and local government employees will carry out a more powerful show of force than the previous one.

    The action plan states that "Sōhyō" workers will participate in the grand rally against the "Security Treaty" to be held in Tokyo on June 11th, as well as the subsequent demonstrations. All workers of the unions affiliated with "Sōhyō" will also actively participate in the four-day street signature campaign starting on June 14th.

    Regarding opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the action plan stipulates that a large-scale demonstration will be held on June 10th to protest against US Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on that day. If the US President comes to Japan despite the opposition of the Japanese people, all "Sōhyō" workers will hang black banners in various places and hold demonstrations or protest rallies. The action plan also stipulates that "Sōhyō" will suggest that all households in Tokyo hang mourning banners at their doors to protest Eisenhower's visit.

    The action plan points out that all member unions of "Sōhyō" should step up their fundraising efforts to support the striking workers of the Miike Coal Mine and send more union cadres to the Miike Coal Mine to participate in the miners' on-site struggle.

    During the discussion of the action plan, many representatives expressed strong anger towards US imperialism. Another feature of this discussion was that almost all speakers expressed firm confidence in victory. The representative of the National Railway Workers' Union pointed out that, due to the strengthening of the railway workers' unity, the struggle on June 15th will be more successful than the struggle on June 4th.

    The congress also passed three resolutions on the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and support for the striking workers of the Miike Coal Mine.

    The congress passed a declaration, guaranteeing that "Sōhyō" workers will work unyieldingly to promote the cause of peace and democracy.

    The congress declaration said: "We, who are attending this national congress, affirm that the workers are now full of confidence in their own strength after experiencing the victorious general strike on June 4th. We guarantee that we will stand at the forefront in the future struggle of the entire Japanese people against the Kishi Cabinet and the Security Treaty. We will never stop our struggle until the decision to dismiss the Miike miners is withdrawn, the Kishi Cabinet is overthrown, the Diet is dissolved, and the Security Treaty is abolished."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" of Japan decided today that on the 15th, the Japanese people will hold a powerful national unified struggle, including a second general strike, against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This decision was made as an emergency measure to deal with the Kishi Nobusuke group's outrageous behavior of unilaterally deliberating on the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors.

    The National Council also unanimously decided that a large-scale protest rally will be held near the Diet on the 11th, and starting from the 12th, workers and ordinary citizens will be mobilized to go to the vicinity of the Diet every day to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal unilateral deliberation of the treaty in the House of Councillors.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: According to a report in the "Akahata" today, the number of signatures across Japan against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" had reached 20 million by June 8th.

    The number of signatures includes those on petitions submitted to the Diet by the end of May opposing the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty," signatures collected since May 31st to demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the "Security Treaty," as well as signatures collected by the Communist Party to protest against the Japanese and American governments' conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The signatures are from people of a wide range of strata across the country. It reflects the Japanese people's firm and unyielding will to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, demand the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, demand the dissolution of the Diet, and strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

    Currently, the signature campaign is continuing to develop across Japan. "Akahata" said that because the number of signatures is increasing rapidly, the number of signatures against the "Security Treaty" will soon reach 27 million – more than half of all Japanese voters.

    In Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture, 40,000 signatures have already been collected, while in Kamaishi City in the same prefecture, 30,000 people have signed petitions against the "Security Treaty." In the signature campaigns in these two cities, most of the eligible voters have signed.

    In Tokyo, about 500 students from about 20 universities conducted a signature campaign on the streets today. The Socialist Party also used ten broadcasting vehicles for a motorcade. Fifty Socialist Party members of parliament called on Tokyo citizens from the propaganda vehicles to participate in the large-scale demonstration to surround the Diet, which will be held on June 11th.

    日本全国已有两千万人签名反对日美军事同盟条约
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第十四次全国代表大会今天胜利闭幕。大会一致通过的运动方针规定，“总评”将在15日举行更强大的第二次全国总罢工，要求废除新日美“安全条约”、推翻岸内阁和解散国会。
    在15日总罢工日，私营企业工人将举行二十四小时罢工，各地政府公务人员将进行比上一次更强大的实力斗争。
    运动方针说，“总评”的工人将参加6月11日在东京举行的反对“安全条约”的盛大集会以及随后举行的示威。“总评”所属的各工会的全体工人还将积极参加从6月14日开始的为期四天的街头签名运动。
    关于反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，运动方针规定，将在6月10日举行大规模的示威，向预定当天到达东京的美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂表示抗议。如果美国总统不顾日本人民的反对而前来日本，“总评”的全体工人将在各地挂起黑色吊幡，举行示威或抗议大会。运动方针还规定，“总评”将建议东京所有住户在门口挂吊幡，抗议艾森豪威尔的访问。
    运动方针指出，“总评”的所有会员工会应当加紧支持三池煤矿罢工工人的募捐运动，并派更多的工会干部前往三池煤矿，参加矿工们的现场斗争。
    在讨论运动方针的时候，许多代表对美帝国主义表示强烈的愤怒。这次讨论的另一个特点是，差不多所有的发言者都对胜利表示了坚定的信心。国营铁道工会的代表指出，由于铁道工人的团结的加强，6月15日的斗争将比6月4日的斗争更加成功地进行。
    大会还通过了关于反对“安全条约”斗争和支持三池煤矿罢工工人斗争的三项决议。
    大会通过宣言，保证“总评”的工人将不屈不挠地为促进和平和民主事业而努力。
    大会宣言说：“出席这次全国代表大会的我们肯定：工人们在经历了胜利的6月4日总罢工以后现在对于自己的力量充满了信心。我们保证，我们将在今后日本全体人民为反对岸内阁和安全条约进行的斗争中站在最前列。我们决不停止我们的斗争，直到收回开除三池矿工的决定，推翻岸内阁，解散国会和废除安全条约。”
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定，在15日，日本人民将举行包括第二次总罢工在内的强大的全国统一斗争，反对日美“安全条约”。这个决定是作为一个紧急措施作出的，来对付岸信介集团在参议院开始单独审议新“安全条约”的横暴行为。
    国民会议还一致决定，11日将在国会附近举行声势浩大的抗议大会，从12日起每天动员工人和普通市民到国会附近去，抗议岸信介集团非法地在参议院单独审议这个条约。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本全国签名反对新日美“安全条约”的到6月8日为止已经达到了两千万人。
    签名的人数中包括到5月底为止在向国会提出的反对国会批准新“安全条约”的请愿书上的签名，自5月31日开始为要求岸信介内阁总辞职、解散国会和废除“安全条约”的签名，以及共产党为抗议日本政府和美国政府缔结日美军事同盟征集的签名。签名的有全国各地广泛阶层的人民。它反映了日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，要求打倒岸信介内阁，要求解散国会，争取独立、和平、民主、中立的坚强不屈的意志。
    现在，日本各地的签名运动在继续发展。“赤旗报”说，由于签名的人数正在迅速增加，反对“安全条约”的签名将很快地达到二千七百万人——日本全体选民的过半数。
    在岩手县的盛冈市已经征集了四万人的签名，而在这同一个县的釜石市，已经有三万人在反对“安全条约”的请愿书上签了名。在这两个市的签名运动中，大多数有资格的选民都签了名。
    在东京，有大约二十个大学的五百名学生今天在街头上进行了征集签名的运动。社会党今天也用十辆广播车进行了汽车游行。五十名社会党议员在宣传车上呼吁东京市民参加即将在6月11日举行的包围国会的大规模示威游行。
