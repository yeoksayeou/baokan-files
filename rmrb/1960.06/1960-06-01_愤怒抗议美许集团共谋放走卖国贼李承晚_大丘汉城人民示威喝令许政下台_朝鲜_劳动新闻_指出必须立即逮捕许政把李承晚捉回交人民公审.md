    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 30th -- Seoul dispatch: The crime of the South Korean Xu Zheng clique and its American masters in releasing traitor Syngman Rhee on the morning of the 29th has aroused unparalleled anger among the people of South Korea.

    According to reports from the South Korean News Agency, a large-scale demonstration broke out in Daegu city today. First, more than 1,500 university students took to the streets. The slogans on their banners read: "The Xu Zheng regime, get out!" "Immediately bring Syngman Rhee back!" Then, large groups of Daegu citizens also joined the ranks of the demonstrators. When the demonstration reached the city center, they angrily shouted slogans such as "Don't allow the United States to harbor Syngman Rhee in exile!" "Down with the Xu Zheng regime!" "Ambassador McConaughy, get out immediately!" The Hapdong News Agency said that the angry demonstrations of the Daegu people had put the entire city in a state of "chaos."

    People from all walks of life in Seoul angrily condemned the crime of the American-Xu Zheng clique in letting the traitor Syngman Rhee escape. According to the Dongyang News Agency, the spokesman for the "Social Mass Party," which is preparing to establish a party, issued a statement on the 29th saying that Syngman Rhee "feared a public trial" for his crimes of treason, so he fled.

    According to the Tonghwa News Agency, people who are preparing to establish the "National Salvation Youth Party" said today that the authorities "must explain to the people" the criminal act of letting Syngman Rhee escape.

    The "Korean Professors Association," which was just established on the 29th, condemned Syngman Rhee's despicable act of fleeing to the United States in its "Declaration on the Current Situation." The declaration said that although he fled, he "cannot escape the responsibility of the past twelve years," and "the people will continue to pursue his responsibility."

    Agence France-Presse reported from Seoul on the 29th that in South Korea, except for the Freedom Party followers of the disgraced Syngman Rhee, all political figures condemned the traitor Syngman Rhee's escape to the United States as "despicable and shameful." They want the Xu Zheng "caretaker cabinet" to "bear full responsibility" for Syngman Rhee's escape. Some parties demanded "severe punishment for those who approved Syngman Rhee's escape abroad."

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 31st -- Seoul dispatch: Today, more than 1,000 university students in Seoul held a demonstration demanding the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly and investigation of the Xu Zheng clique's crime of letting the traitor Syngman Rhee escape. According to the South Korean News Agency, at 9:30 this morning, more than 1,000 students from Dankook University in Seoul took to the streets. They angrily shouted in front of the puppet "National Assembly Building": "The corrupt National Assembly, step down!" "No trust in the dictatorial remnant - the Xu Zheng cabinet!" "We must investigate the responsibility for letting the traitor Syngman Rhee escape!" "Chang Myon (leader of the South Korean Democratic Party), who stained the students' blood, must confess to the students nationwide!"

    The demonstration also included a broadcasting vehicle that distributed many leaflets along the way.

    According to Seoul Radio, students from Kyung Hee University in Seoul also participated in the demonstration.

    According to a report from the South Korean Hapdong News Agency, when the demonstrating students held a sit-in demonstration in front of the puppet "National Assembly Building" at 2:00 p.m., the puppet authorities mobilized military police to suppress them, but they were repelled by the students.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 31st -- The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today, severely condemning the crime of the American-Xu Zheng clique in conspiring to release the heinous traitor Syngman Rhee. The editorial said that Xu Zheng, the perpetrator who released the traitor Syngman Rhee, must be arrested and punished immediately, and Syngman Rhee must be brought back immediately for public trial by the people.

    The editorial pointed out that the act of the US imperialists and their new lackey, the Xu Zheng clique, in conspiring to release the heinous criminal Syngman Rhee is a blatant challenge to the South Korean people who have stood up to fight. This incident proves that the Xu Zheng clique is the mortal enemy of the Korean people, a lackey of US imperialism like the traitor Syngman Rhee, and a scum who sells out the country and betrays the nation.

    The editorial emphasized that at a time when the South Korean people's calls for punishing Syngman Rhee are rising, US imperialism hastily sent this criminal to the United States, which is a tacit admission to the world that US imperialism itself is the mastermind directly responsible for the crimes of this old lackey, and Syngman Rhee is only its tool. US imperialism fears that once Syngman Rhee is publicly tried by the people, it will completely expose all the heinous acts of aggression and crimes it has committed in Korea.

    The editorial said that Syngman Rhee's so-called "lifelong career" was to implement the most barbaric murderous colonial policy of US imperialism in the twentieth century. The name Syngman Rhee is synonymous with the crimes committed by US imperialism in the twentieth century.

    The editorial said that even if the traitor Syngman Rhee has escaped, all the crimes he and US imperialism committed in Korea must be settled. The Korean people must demand blood debts! We must punish the traitors!

    愤怒抗议美许集团共谋放走卖国贼李承晚
    大丘汉城人民示威喝令许政下台
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出必须立即逮捕许政把李承晚捉回交人民公审
    新华社平壤30日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜许政集团同它的美国主子在29日上午放走了卖国贼李承晚的罪行，激起了南朝鲜各地人民无比的愤怒。
    据南朝鲜通讯社报道，今天大丘市爆发了大规模示威。先是一千五百多名大学生走上大街。他们高举着的标语牌上写着：“许政政权滚下台来！”“立即把李承晚解回来！”接着，数量很多的一群群的大丘市民，也参加了示威者的行列。示威队伍到达市中心时，还愤怒地高呼“不准美国留纳李承晚流亡！”“打倒许政政权！”“麦康瑙吉大使立刻滚蛋！”等口号。合同通讯社说，大丘人民的愤怒的示威已使整个城市处于“混乱状态”中。
    汉城各界人士都愤怒地谴责美国—许政集团放跑卖国贼李承晚的罪行。据东洋通讯社报道，正在筹备建党的“社会大众党”的发言人29日发表谈话说，李承晚“害怕民众审判”他的卖国罪行，所以逃跑了。
    据同和通讯社报道，正在筹备建立“救国青年党”的人士今天说，当局“必须向国民交代”放跑李承晚的罪恶行为。
    刚在29日成立的“韩国教授协会”在它发表的“时局宣言”中谴责李承晚逃往美国的卑鄙行为。宣言说，他虽然逃跑了，但是他“逃避不了十二年来的责任”，“国民将继续追究他的责任”。
    法新社29日发自汉城的消息说，在南朝鲜，除了名誉扫地的李承晚的自由党党徒之外，所有的政界人士都谴责卖国贼李承晚逃往美国是“卑鄙可耻”的。他们要许政“看守内阁”对李承晚逃跑“负全部责任”。有些党派要求“严惩批准李承晚逃跑出国的那些人”。
    新华社平壤31日电　汉城消息：今天汉城市一千多名大学生举行示威，要求立即解散国会，并且追究许政集团放走卖国贼李承晚的罪行。据南朝鲜通讯社报道，今天上午九时半，汉城檀国大学全校一千多名学生走上了大街。他们在伪“国会议事堂”门前愤怒地高呼：“腐败的国会下台！”“不信任独裁残余——许政内阁！”“要追究放走卖国贼李承晚的责任！”“玷污学生鲜血的张勉（南朝鲜民主党领袖）要向全国学生认罪！”
    示威的队伍里还开着一辆广播汽车，沿路散发了许多传单。
    据汉城广播电台广播，汉城庆锡大学的学生也参加了示威。
    另据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，当示威的学生下午两点钟在伪“国会议事堂”门前举行静坐示威时，傀儡当局曾调动军警镇压，结果被学生们击退了。
    新华社平壤31日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，严厉谴责美国—许政集团共谋放走罪大恶极的卖国贼李承晚的罪行。社论说，必须立即逮捕和惩办放走卖国贼李承晚的现行犯许政，必须立即把李承晚捉回来交给人民公审。
    社论指出，美帝国主义和它的新走狗许政集团共谋放走罪大恶极的罪犯李承晚的行为，是对站起来进行斗争的南朝鲜人民的公然的挑战。这一事件证明许政集团是朝鲜人民的死敌，是和卖国贼李承晚一样的美帝国主义的走狗，是出卖国家、背叛民族的败类。
    社论强调指出，在南朝鲜人民要求惩办李承晚的呼声日益高涨的时候，美帝国主义把这个罪犯慌忙送到美国，这就向全世界不打自招地承认了对这个老走狗的罪行负直接责任的主谋者是美帝国主义自己，李承晚只是它的工具。美帝国主义害怕李承晚一旦被人民公审会完全暴露它在朝鲜进行的一切穷凶极恶的侵略行为和罪恶。
    社论说，李承晚的所谓“毕生大业”就是执行了二十世纪最野蛮的美帝国主义的杀人的殖民政策。李承晚的名字就是美帝国主义在二十世纪制造的罪恶的同义语。
    社论说，即便是卖国贼晚李承逃跑了，也要清算他同美帝国主义一道在朝鲜犯下的一切罪行。朝鲜人民一定要讨还血债！一定要惩办卖国贼！
