Running newspapers by the whole Party is the fundamental policy of newspaper work
Representative of Anhui Daily, Zhong Chong

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, Anhui Daily has held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, publicized the great victories of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, basically completed the tasks assigned to us by the Party, and played the role of the provincial newspaper in "organizing, inspiring, motivating, criticizing, and promoting." The main reason why Anhui Daily has achieved certain successes in publicity is that it has relatively thoroughly resolved the relationship between the newspaper and the Party, resolutely obeyed the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and conscientiously implemented the policy of running newspapers by the whole Party.

I.

Running newspapers by the whole Party is the fundamental policy of Party newspaper work. In the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, Anhui deeply launched the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party. The main characteristics of this movement are: the Party Committee strengthens its leadership over newspaper work, establishes writing groups headed by the First Secretary at each level, and implements the methods of "walking on two legs" and "three combinations" in newspaper work.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee strengthens its leadership over newspapers, first of all, by constantly analyzing the situation to the newspaper, helping the newspaper to distinguish the direction and resist adverse currents, and clarifying the direction of publicity, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in accordance with the spirit of the General Line. Anhui launched large-scale water conservancy projects in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, creating the miracle of "800 million, 800 million, and another 800 million" cubic meters of earthwork, completing more earthwork in one winter and spring than the total completed in the eight years after liberation. At this time, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out to the newspaper that the current task was to guide the situation and promote all fronts to learn from the water conservancy front and launch a high tide of overall Great Leap Forward. The newspaper then continuously published a series of articles, publicizing the great significance of the water conservancy Great Leap Forward, the soaring enthusiasm of all fronts in learning from the water conservancy front, and also published the editorial "Simultaneous Development and Simultaneous Advancement," which played a certain guiding role in promoting the mass movement of the overall Great Leap Forward. After the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, some comrades regarded planting less, high yield, and more harvest as the current guiding principle, and doubted whether they should plant more. At this time, the Provincial Party Committee analyzed the basic situation of agricultural production in our province to the newspaper, pointing out that agricultural production still has three barriers to overcome: "water conservancy, fertilizer, and machinery," and the yield per unit area has not reached the due level. Now, we must resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs proposed by the Party Central Committee, and while striving for high yield and more harvest, continue to adopt various measures to adhere to planting more and harvesting more. Therefore, in the autumn planting of 1958 and the spring planting of 1959, we continuously and intensively publicized measures such as land reclamation, expanding planting area, using all vacant land and wasteland for planting, and intercropping to expand the planting area. Whenever right-leaning adverse currents struck, the Provincial Party Committee promptly instructed the newspaper to improve its sense of smell, discern the direction, and resist the right-leaning adverse currents. For example, in the spring of 1957, some people stirred up the evil wind of opposing "rash advances." The Provincial Party Committee adopted a firm attitude of resistance, instructing the newspaper to repeatedly publicize the superiority of cooperation, publicize the great achievements of socialism, and published the editorial "Vigorously Develop Production and Strive to Accelerate the Speed of Socialist Construction in Anhui." In this editorial, various ideas promoting retreat were criticized, pointing out that Anhui has great potential for vigorously developing industrial and agricultural production, and proposed that the speed of socialist construction should be accelerated. This was an editorial that adhered to Chairman Mao's policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and opposed the right-leaning adverse current. In the spring of 1959, some people, under the pretext of implementation, advocated that construction targets should be as low as possible, and under the pretext of opposing exaggeration, advocated slowing down the speed of construction. Under the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the newspaper correctly realized that implementing the targets and opposing exaggeration were for a better leap forward, and therefore resolutely resisted this right-leaning cold wind, vigorously and systematically publicized the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, talked about the favorable situation, talked about the favorable conditions, thoroughly criticized right-leaning ideas, and boosted revolutionary enthusiasm, constantly pushing forward the industrial and agricultural production movement. Because Anhui Daily resolutely obeyed the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, it also paid close attention to the publicity of directional issues. Of course, due to the low level of our newspaper staff, more efforts must be made to strengthen the ideological and combat effectiveness of the newspaper.

The Provincial Party Committee also instructed the newspaper to focus on the publicity of central tasks, correctly publicize the Party's policies and principles; and promote the development of the mass movement of socialist construction by grasping new things and typical reports. When large-scale steelmaking began in the second half of 1958, Anhui Daily lacked sufficient understanding of the significance of "small-scale modern iron smelting furnaces" and did not give it due attention. The Provincial Party Committee promptly criticized this and helped us correct our understanding of a series of issues. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, we prominently publicized the significance and achievements of the "small-scale modern iron smelting furnaces," correctly pointed out the relationship between vigorously developing mass movements and strengthening technical guidance, the relationship between production and capital construction, and the relationship between shock production and balanced high production. The Party's policy was more completely reflected, and the development of the mass movement was powerfully promoted. "Three Improvements" is an effective method for developing agricultural production in our province. In recent years, under the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, we have not only deeply publicized the significance of "Three Improvements," but also publicized many new developments of "Three Improvements."

In order to strengthen the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee over newspaper work, not only the First Secretary frequently grasps it, but also a leading group headed by the First Secretary was established in the organization to regularly discuss the publicity center of the newspaper, study reporting plans and commentary plans, and uniformly arrange writing forces; secretaries in charge of various aspects of work and responsible comrades of various departments grasp relevant publicity, and simultaneously consider reporting issues when arranging tasks and solving problems, and frequently give instructions to the newspaper, propose topics, talk about viewpoints, and provide reporting clues. In order to promote the method of the Provincial Party Committee leading the newspaper to the Party organizations at all levels throughout the province, and mobilize the strength of the whole Party to run the newspaper well, the Provincial Party Committee decided that Party committees at all levels above the county level and Party committees of larger factories and mines should establish writing groups headed by the First Secretary, and absorb responsible comrades from various departments and comrades with a certain political level and writing ability to participate, and gave instructions on the working methods of writing groups of Party committees at all levels.

Due to the importance and leadership of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels, since 1958, Party committees of prefectures (cities), county committees, commune Party committees, factory and mine Party committees, and university Party committees throughout the province have established writing groups headed by the First Secretary. Among them, there are 182 writing groups of Party committees above the county level alone, with 2,354 full-time and part-time personnel, and each writing group has 5 to 10 full-time writing cadres. The establishment of writing groups headed by the First Secretary by Party committees at all levels is a new organizational form that has emerged in the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party. In the past, although the newspaper had a large number of correspondence groups, which also played a role in reporting, they were not headed by the First Secretary of the Party Committee, and a considerable number of them lacked practical work experience. Therefore, relying solely on them could not promptly and powerfully reflect the Party's intentions and fully reflect the breadth and depth of the Great Leap Forward movement. After the establishment of Party Committee writing groups headed by the First Secretary, because the First Secretary of the Party Committee and the Party's backbone at all levels personally lead the mass movement, have a deep understanding of the Party's line and policies, can clearly distinguish the direction, grasp the climate, and have rich experience in struggle, they form the writing group with them as the main force, regularly propose topics and write articles, mobilize the strength of all aspects to organize reports, and together with the vast number of correspondents, reflect the situation to the newspaper from different corners, the newspaper can better grasp the political climate, closely combine with actual struggles, and reflect the scale and trend of the Great Leap Forward movement.

With the establishment of writing groups by Party committees at all levels and the allocation of full-time cadres, the method of "walking on two legs" and "three combinations" can be better used to lead newspaper work and writing work. The so-called two legs, in terms of the entire news team, are professional and non-professional; in terms of the non-professional team, there are writing groups directly led by the Party Committee and correspondents distributed in various fronts and corners. The so-called "three combinations," in terms of the entire newspaper work, are the combination of Party Committee leadership, professional journalists, and vast numbers of correspondents. The Party Committee points out the direction and puts forward tasks, and professional journalists organize vast numbers of correspondents to complete them together; in terms of the writing of an important manuscript, it is the combination of leading cadres, editors, and the masses. Leading cadres put forward viewpoints, the masses provide specific materials, editors write, collectively revise, and the Party Committee reviews; in terms of the working methods of the writing group, it is the combination of learning, work, and writing, emphasizing learning to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze problems and guide writing, and unifying the writing process with the process of investigation and research and summarizing work. Party committees at all levels study the reporting plan of the writing group on a monthly basis, absorb writing group personnel to attend Party committee meetings as non-voting delegates, go to the countryside and factories with the Secretary, and study theory together with the person in charge of the Party committee. Competitions are also frequently carried out among the writing groups of Party committees in various places to write more manuscripts and better manuscripts.

The role of the Party Committee writing group is very significant. According to statistics, the writing groups of Party committees at all levels wrote only for the Anhui Daily an average of more than 330 articles per month in 1958, with an adoption rate of 23.6%, and an average of more than 700 articles per month from 1959 to the present, with an adoption rate of 26.3%. The writing groups of Party committees at all levels have undertaken the writing tasks of most of the important manuscripts for the newspaper, not only writing general news and newsletters, but also writing typical reports and group reports, writing commentaries and articles, organizing special pages, and providing pictures. The writing groups of Party committees at all levels also frequently and promptly tell the newspaper editorial department about the local work situation and the opinions of the local Party Committee on the reports. Writing groups that come to the editorial department to talk about reports and the situation are four or five every day. In short, deeply launching the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party has created an extremely favorable situation for running Party newspapers well.

II.

In order to resolutely implement the policy of running newspapers by the whole Party, Anhui Daily has deeply carried out the struggle between the two lines of running newspapers since the rectification and anti-rightist movement. The anti-Party activities of rightist elements and right-leaning opportunists who opposed the Party's leadership, used newspapers to publicize bourgeois ideology, and insisted on the "expert-run newspaper" line were thoroughly exposed and criticized, further establishing the proletarian world outlook and the idea of resolutely obeying the Party's leadership. After the two rectification and anti-rightist movements, the education of running newspapers by the whole Party was repeatedly carried out through regular political and ideological work, pointing out that the ideological transformation of intellectuals is a long-term and arduous process. Calling on everyone to consciously carry out ideological transformation, thoroughly break the bourgeois world outlook, consolidate the proletarian world outlook, and be a good mouthpiece and ears and eyes of the Party. Not only should we listen to the Party in major aspects, but also in all aspects; not only should we actively ask the Party Committee to give instructions on reporting work, but also carefully study why the Party Committee gives such instructions and how to accurately, comprehensively, and forcefully implement them; not only should we resolutely and promptly implement every instruction of the Party Committee, but also study what the Party Committee is considering, and keep pace with the Party Committee and be in harmony with each other; not only should we absolutely obey the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, but also resolutely rely on the support of Party committees at all levels and closely cooperate with all aspects, emphasizing that only by closely relying on the Party's backbone at all levels and relying on the strength of the whole Party can we improve the ideological and guiding nature of the newspaper, better connect with reality and the masses, and complete the new tasks put forward by the Great Leap Forward situation to the newspaper. In order to strengthen ideological transformation, Anhui Daily has always adhered to the system of cadres taking turns to go down to participate in physical labor and participate in grassroots work since the large-scale steelmaking began. Eighty-two cadres have been sent down to the People's Commune so far. This has had a significant effect on improving the labor point of view, increasing production knowledge, and cultivating the style of cadres closely combining with reality.

On the basis of thoroughly solving the relationship between the newspaper and the Party, the editorial board of Anhui Daily has formulated a series of systems. Such as: the system of studying the Party Central Committee's policies and principles and the articles of the responsible persons of the Central Committee; the system of participating in relevant meetings of the Party Committee and timely conveying and studying the implementation; the system of sending the reporting plan and commentary plan to the Provincial Party Committee for review every month; the system of reporting the selection and arrangement of the week to the responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee every week; the system of studying the articles of the responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee and studying the important manuscripts revised by the Provincial Party Committee; as well as the regulations for handling manuscripts from the responsible persons of the Party Committee of the prefecture (city) and county, the regulations for handling manuscripts signed by the responsible persons of the Party Committee of the prefecture (city), and the regulations for earnestly receiving visits from the writing group of the Party Committee, etc. The editorial board also decided to allocate full-time cadres in the collection and communication department to specifically manage the manuscripts from the writing groups of the Party Committee, receive visits from the writing groups, and edit the "Interview and Communication" publication. For local reporter stations, they are handed over to the leadership of the local Party Committee in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Party Committee. They are required to promptly tell the local Party Committee about the requirements of the editorial department, and the local Party Committee formulates the reporting plan for the region according to the requirements of the editorial department and the local situation. The reporter station then completes the tasks assigned to it under the unified arrangement of the local Party Committee. At the same time, reporters are required to rely on the local Party Committee every time they go to an interview, closely cooperate with the writing group personnel and correspondents, and interview, help, and learn from each other.

After taking the above measures, most of the staff of the editorial department of Anhui Daily can absolutely obey the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and have always been active, proactive, and enthusiastic in striving for Party committees at all levels to participate in newspaper work. Whenever the Provincial Party Committee arranges any major task or puts forward instructions on the report, the editorial department immediately discusses it and studies how to correctly and forcefully reflect it in the newspaper; and promptly conveys the requirements of the editorial department to the writing groups of Party committees at all levels, relying on them to organize reports in a timely manner. The editorial department frequently invites the responsible persons of Party committees at all levels to summarize the work of the region, discuss the facts and the theory, and write commentaries and articles for the newspaper. For the manuscripts from the responsible persons of the Party Committee, as long as the content is commendable, even if the first draft is poor, it is repeatedly supplemented and rewritten, and never easily discarded. When organizing key manuscripts, the editor can make clear and specific explanations of the reporting intention, the theme of the manuscript, and even the structure, and play a leading role in writing business as much as possible. Some major typical or campaign-type reports are written by the newspaper sending people to cooperate with the Party Committee writing group. The editorial department also conveys the publicity requirements formulated by the newspaper according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee through communication publications, reports how the responsible persons of the Party Committee in various places strengthen the leadership of the writing work, timely disseminate the successful working experience of the writing groups of the Party Committee in various places, and regularly publishes the manuscript submission situation of the writing groups in various places to promote the competition between the writing groups.

Since the reporter station was handed over to the local Party Committee for leadership, most of the reporters have resolutely obeyed the leadership of the local Party Committee, and have made more obvious progress in ideology and work. For example, the Ma'anshan reporter station of this newspaper has done everything by relying on the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee. As long as the Municipal Party Committee puts forward any task, it always seizes the time to complete it quickly. The reporter delves into and conducts investigations and studies on any issues of particular concern to the Party Committee, and proactively serves as the Party Committee's eyes and ears.

III.

The significance of the movement to run newspapers by the whole Party is very great. Since deeply launching the movement to run newspapers by the whole Party, we have initially realized the following gains:

First, it is more timely and prominent to grasp directional, critical, and major campaign-type reports. In the past, the newspaper paid attention to grasping directional and critical issues under the leadership of the Party, but there were still many difficulties in how to firmly grasp these issues, make a big deal of articles, and explain them accurately and thoroughly. After universally launching the movement to run newspapers by the whole Party, the situation has greatly changed. After clarifying the direction of publicity, as long as the editorial department relies on Party committees at all levels and does a good job of organization, it will not be powerless, but will be more handy in making a big deal of directional and critical issues and organizing large-scale campaign-type reports. Last spring, a few people stirred up a cold wind and issued the so-called right-leaning fallacy that "the lower the target, the better." At this time, the Provincial Party Committee instructed to resist the adverse current and enthusiastically launch the spring production movement, and clearly put forward three distinct slogans: "Great publicity, boost enthusiasm," "Great inspection, grasp preparation for plowing," and "Great competition, seize a bumper harvest." According to this instruction, the newspaper editorial department immediately organized the writing groups of Party committees at all levels to jointly complete this reporting task. In less than ten days, the editorial department received more than 300 articles in this regard, selected more than 50 of them, and continuously organized five full-page reports to conduct concentrated and prominent publicity, and published three editorials in a row with the three slogans of the Provincial Party Committee as the title. These manuscripts implemented the spirit of anti-rightist and boosting enthusiasm, expressed the ambition of the people of the province to continue to strive for the top, publicized the hot red flag competition movement, and introduced various measures to seize the victory of the spring production movement. In December last year, the Provincial Party Committee's light industry conference called for accelerating the development of light industry. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the newspaper immediately organized the writing groups of Party committees in various places to concentrate their efforts to strengthen the publicity of light industry. With their strong support, the newspaper published nearly 100 articles in more than a month. These articles systematically publicized from the necessity and possibility of realizing the call of the Provincial Party Committee, how to further implement the Party's policy of vigorously developing light industry, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and how to solve the key problems in the high-speed development of light industry, with generalization and typicality, and played a certain role in promoting the mass movement of vigorously developing light industry. Many other important campaign-type reports in the past two years have also been completed by relying on the writing groups of Party committees in various places. For example, the publicity celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China had a huge number of published articles and a vast amount of materials, which must be carefully selected, supplemented, and sorted out. Because we relied on the Provincial Party Committee, clarified the reporting intention, and organized the writing groups of Party committees at all levels to complete it together, we published more than 30 special pages and more than 200 articles in a short period of time, and the content was generally more substantial. This spring, our province convened an agricultural hero conference. Forty writing groups from prefecture and county Party committees sent 50 writing cadres to undertake the writing tasks of most of the manuscripts. The writing groups of Party committees in various places also organized many people to conduct on-site interviews and supplement materials, achieving a combination of interviews at the conference and interviews outside the conference. As a result, in eight or nine days, they completed the writing task of 120,000 words and eight special pages.

Second, the number of commentaries has greatly increased, and the quality has also improved. According to statistics, from July 1959 to April this year, 32 editorials, 36 commentaries, and 156 articles written by the secretaries of Party committees of prefectures, cities, and counties were published in the newspaper. These commentaries and articles are all written by summarizing the successful experiences of various places or commenting on certain new things and new problems, combined with advanced typicals, and can generally clearly reflect the Party's ideas and analyze problems more thoroughly. Among the commentaries published in Anhui Daily in March and April this year, 43 were internally reviewed and red flags were inserted, of which 27 were written by responsible comrades of the Party Committee and writing groups, accounting for more than half.

Third, Party committees at all levels select typicals, and red flags are inserted more and more accurately. In the past, the newspaper found typicals, but now Party committees at all levels select typicals to recommend to the newspaper. Party committees at all levels originally grasp typicals to guide the overall situation in leading actual work, have a large number of typicals, can select the best from the best when reporting, and make accurate and profound analyses of the significance of typical things. Last year, the editorial department prepared to introduce an advanced production team in the newspaper. When this request was submitted to the Fuyang Prefectural Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee immediately instructed several county Party committees to recommend reporting objects; the Fuyang County Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Prefectural Party Committee, arranged at the county commune Party committee secretary meeting that each commune report an exemplary production team to the meeting for comparison. After three discussions and studies, the best was selected from the best, and it was finally decided to introduce the Taoyuan Production Team. The responsible comrades of the county and prefectural Party committees repeatedly studied and revised each written manuscript. After it was published, it was universally cited as an example to learn from by production teams throughout the province. The report on the large-scale cultural and educational cooperation organized by the Hefei Municipal Party Committee in March this year is also a more prominent example. In order to complete this group of typical reports of great significance, the First Secretary of the Hefei Municipal Party Committee and the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee in charge of culture and education personally took command, convened several symposiums, talked about the situation, talked about problems, and talked about experience. The responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee put forward viewpoints, determined the selection of topics, and drew eleven cadres to specialize in the crash project, and went to conduct special interviews separately. After the manuscripts were written, they were personally revised by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. In more than ten days, two or more versions of manuscripts were written, including news, editorials, newsletters, and experiences, which concentrated and powerfully publicized the new thing of cultural and educational cooperation. Other relatively successful typical reports, such as the transformation from poor to rich in Jilunzhai in Guoyang, the starting of a factory from scratch by the Red Five Women in Bengbu, and the handling of major events with poor methods in the Anqing Silk Guang Printing and Dyeing Factory, were also recommended by Party committees in various places.

Fourth, the balance of aspects and regions in the reports has been further resolved. In the past, we also strived to achieve balance in the reports, but it was still impossible to solve this problem well by relying solely on the efforts of the editorial department. We have certain limitations in terms of manpower and understanding of the situation. After Party Committee writing groups were established in various regions and departments, the new achievements, new experiences, and new problems of various regions and departments can be promptly reflected to the editorial department, which greatly facilitates solving the balance problem and eliminating the so-called "blank areas" and "blank spots" in the reports. Since the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the strong support of Party committees at all levels, we have not only concentrated and prominently reported on the Great Leap Forward in economic construction, but also made considerable improvements in the reports on education, culture, science, health, and sports. For example, the popular science and popular philosophy in Lai'an County, the cultural work in Siji Township in Chao County, the literacy work in Huangkou Town in Xiao County, the education revolution in Bengbu, and the recently reported cultural and educational cooperation in Hefei are all typical reports with greater influence. In terms of regional balance, some places that used to receive very few manuscripts and were rarely reported, such as Tianchang, Yuexi, Guangde, Hanshan, and He County, have not only sent a large number of manuscripts to the newspaper since the establishment of the writing group, but the quality of the manuscripts has also improved compared to the past, and manuscripts are frequently published. According to statistics, from the third quarter of last year to April this year, the Tianchang County Committee writing group sent a total of 255 manuscripts, 61 of which were adopted, and the Yuexi County Committee sent a total of 73 manuscripts, 18 of which were adopted.

Fifth, the strength of local reporter stations has been used more rationally. After the reporter station was handed over to the local Party Committee for leadership, the relationship with the Party Committee became closer, the local Party Committee's leadership of them became more specific and more frequent, and the reporter station could better divide and cooperate with the local Party Committee writing group. This promoted the integration of the reporter station with actual work, enabling the reporter station to use its main strength to conduct in-depth investigations and studies, and grasp typical reports of great significance. For example, the manuscripts written by the Bengbu reporter station in the first quarter of this year, the typical reports have rapidly increased from about one-third of the total number of published articles last year to more than two-thirds. In the vigorous mass movement of technological revolution, the comrades of this station conducted in-depth interviews, seized advanced units to make a big deal of articles, and made three consecutive systematic, concentrated, and prominent reports on the rapid realization of mechanization, gasification, and continuous operation of thermos bottle production in the Bengbu Glass Factory. After these manuscripts were published, red flags were inserted in the editorial department's review of the reports.

Sixth, the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party has promoted the use of newspapers by the whole Party. With the development of the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party, Party committees at all levels organically combine writing for newspapers with guiding the work of the region and departments, and are more concerned about using newspapers. After the leadership experience of the Taoyuan Production Team in Fuyang County was published in Anhui Daily, the Fuyang Prefectural Party Committee immediately made arrangements at the county Party committee secretary meeting, requiring all localities to seriously study the experience of the Taoyuan Team and launch a competition to learn from and catch up with the Taoyuan Team. After Anhui Daily published the news and editorial on the formulation of agricultural production operating procedures in Taihu last year, the vast majority of county and commune Party committees in the province studied and promoted this experience.

Seventh, the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party has promoted investigation and research and summarizing work. Last year, Dongzhi County achieved full possession of plowing cattle. After the County Party Committee decided to report it, it seriously started from summarizing experience. The secretary in charge of animal husbandry convened a meeting of 75 animal husbandry veterinarians and technical cadres and conducted many symposiums. At the same time, the comrades of the writing group went to the commune to investigate and visit, mastered rich materials, and then, after collective research, analysis, and improvement, and repeated revisions, they wrote "The Experience of Full Possession of Plowing Cattle in Dongzhi County," which was of very good quality. After Anhui Daily published it, relevant departments of the Central Committee also compiled this article into a book and recommended it to various places as a typical example.

Eighth, the movement of running newspapers by the whole Party has cultivated the writing team. Through writing for newspapers, the comrades of the Party Committee writing group often went to the countryside and factories with the leading comrades of the Party Committee to understand the situation, study theory, and study problems. Their ideological level and writing level have been universally improved. Some of them started by writing dynamic news and gradually learned to write typical reports, newsletters, feature articles, experience articles, and commentaries, and some also learned to write editorials and organize full-page special reports. This provides a strong guarantee for further improving the propaganda quality of the newspaper.

Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, Anhui Daily has achieved certain results in implementing the policy of running newspapers by the whole Party. However, our level is far from being able to meet the needs of Party newspaper work, and there are still many shortcomings and problems in our work. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, study the Party's policies and principles, strengthen the connection with actual work, learn from the experience of People's Daily and brother newspapers, and strive to improve the theoretical, ideological, and guiding nature of newspaper publicity.

    全党办报是报纸工作的根本方针
    安徽日报代表　仲冲
    大跃进以来，安徽日报在省委的领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，宣传了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，基本上完成了党交给我们的任务，发挥了省报“组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动”的作用。安徽日报所以能够在宣传上取得了一定的成绩，主要的原因是比较彻底地解决了报纸和党的关系问题，做到坚决地服从省委的领导，认真地贯彻全党办报的方针。
    一
    全党办报是党报工作的根本方针。在大跃进的新形势下，安徽深入地开展了全党办报运动。这个运动的主要特点是：党委加强对报纸工作的领导，逐级建立以第一书记挂帅的写作组，在办报工作中实行两条腿走路和“三结合”的方法。
    安徽省委加强对报纸的领导，首先是根据党中央和毛主席的指示，根据总路线的精神，经常地向报社分析形势，帮助报纸辨风向、顶逆流，明确宣传方向。安徽1957年冬和1958年春大兴水利，创造了“八亿、八亿、再八亿”的奇迹，一个冬春完成的土石方，比解放后八年来完成的总数还多。这时，省委向报社指出：现在的任务是要因势利导，推动各个战线向治水战线看齐，掀起一个全面大跃进的高潮。报社便连续发表了一系列的稿件，宣传治水大跃进的伟大意义，各个战线向治水战线看齐的冲天干劲，而且发表了“同时并举、齐头并进”的社论，对于促进全面大跃进的群众运动，起了一定的指导作用。1958年农业生产大跃进以后，有一部分同志把少种、高产、多收，当作是当前的行动方针，对是否应该多种发生了怀疑。这时，省委向报社分析了我省农业生产基本形势，指出：农业生产还有“水利、肥料、机械”三关未过，单位面积产量也未达到应有水平，现在还必须坚决贯彻党中央提出的两条腿走路的方针，在力争高产多收的同时，继续采取各种措施，坚持多种、多收。因此，在1958年秋种和1959年春种中，我们便连续而集中地宣传了开荒、扩种，利用一切空隙地、废地扩种以及套种等措施，扩大播种面积。每当右倾逆流袭来的时候，省委便及时指示报社要提高嗅觉，辨明风向，顶住右倾逆流。如1957年春，有人刮起反“冒进”的歪风，省委采取了坚决抵制的态度，指示报社反复地宣传合作化的优越性，宣传社会主义的伟大成就，发表了“大力发展生产，为加速安徽的社会主义建设速度而奋斗”的社论。在这篇社论中，对各种促退思想进行了批判，指出了安徽有大力发展工农业生产的巨大潜力，提出应该加速社会主义建设的速度。这是一篇坚持毛主席的多快好省建设方针的社论，反对右倾逆流的社论。1959年春季，又有些人借落实为名，主张建设指标越低越好，借反浮夸为名，主张放慢建设的速度。报社在省委指示下，正确地认识到指标落实、反对浮夸是为了更好的跃进，因而坚决抵住了这股右倾冷风，大张旗鼓地、系统地宣传了总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝，大讲有利形势，大摆有利条件，大破右倾思想，大鼓革命干劲，把工农业生产运动不断推向前进。安徽日报由于坚决服从省委的领导，对方向性问题的宣传也是抓得紧的。当然，由于我们报社工作人员水平低，如何加强报纸的思想性和战斗性，还必须作更多的努力。
    省委还指示报纸必须围绕中心任务的宣传，正确地宣传党的方针、政策；通过抓新生事物，抓典型报道，以推动社会主义建设群众运动的发展。1958年下半年开始大办钢铁时，安徽日报对于钢铁“小洋群”的意义缺乏足够的认识，没有加以应有的重视，省委及时提出了批评，帮助我们端正了对于一系列问题的认识。根据省委的指示，我们突出地宣传了“小洋群”的意义和成就，正确地指出了大搞群众运动和加强技术指导的关系，生产和基建的关系，突击生产和均衡高产的关系。比较完整地体现了党的方针，有力地推动了群众运动的发展。“三改”是我省发展农业生产行之有效的办法，近几年来，我们在省委的指示下，不仅深入宣传了“三改”的意义，而且宣传了“三改”的许多新发展。
    省委为了加强对报纸工作的领导，不仅第一书记经常抓，还在组织上建立了第一书记挂帅的领导小组，定期讨论报纸的宣传中心，研究报道计划和言论计划，统一安排写作力量；分管各方面工作的书记和各部门负责同志，都抓有关的宣传，在布置任务、解决问题的时候，同时考虑报道问题，经常向报纸做指示，出题目，谈观点，提供报道线索。为了把省委领导报纸的方法推广到全省各级党组织中去，调动全党的力量来办好报纸，省委决定县以上各级党委和较大的厂矿党委，建立以第一书记挂帅的写作组，吸收各部门负责同志和有一定政治水平、写作能力的同志参加，并对各级党委写作组的工作方法作了指示。
    由于安徽省委、各级党委的重视和领导，从1958年以来，全省各地（市）委、县委、公社党委、厂矿党委、大专学校党委，都已建立了第一书记挂帅的写作组。其中，仅县以上党委写作组有一百八十二个，拥有专职、非专职人员二千三百五十四人，每个写作组都有专职写作干部五至十人。各级党委建立第一书记挂帅的写作组，这是全党办报运动中出现的新的组织形式。过去，报社虽有大量的通讯组，在报道中也起过作用，但不是党委第一书记挂帅的，其中又有相当的一部分人缺乏实际工作经验。因此，仅仅依靠他们，不能及时、有力地体现党的意图，充分反映大跃进运动的广度和深度。建立了第一书记挂帅的党委写作组以后，由于党委第一书记和各级党的骨干，是亲自领导群众运动的，对于党的路线、方针有深刻的认识，能够明辨方向，掌握气候，具有丰富的斗争经验，以他们为主组成写作组，定期出题目作文章，调动各方面的力量来组织报道，再加上广大通讯员个人，从不同的角落里向报纸反映情况，报纸便能更好地掌握政治气候，和实际斗争紧密结合，反映大跃进运动的规模和趋向。
    各级党委建立了写作组，配备了专职干部，就可以更好地运用两条腿走路和“三结合”的方法领导报纸工作和写作工作。所谓两条腿，就整个新闻队伍讲，有专业与非专业；就非专业队伍讲，有党委直接领导的写作组，有分布在各个战线、各个角落的通讯员。所谓“三结合”，就整个报纸工作讲，是党委领导、专业新闻工作者与广大通讯员相结合，由党委指出方向、提出任务，由专业新闻工作者组织广大通讯员共同完成；就一篇重要稿件的写作讲，是领导干部、编写人员和群众相结合，由领导干部提出观点，群众提供具体材料，编写人员执笔，集体修改，党委审查；就写作组的工作方法讲，是学习、工作、写作三结合，强调学习运用毛泽东思想来分析问题、指导写作，把写作的过程和调查研究、总结工作的过程统一起来。各级党委按月研究写作组报道计划，吸收写作组人员列席党委会议，随书记下乡、下厂，和党委负责人一道学习理论。在各地党委写作组之间，还经常地开展多写稿、写好稿的竞赛。
    党委写作组的作用是非常显著的。据统计，各级党委写作组仅为安徽日报采写的稿件，1958年平均每月为三百三十多篇，采用率为23．6％，1959年至最近，平均每月为七百多篇，采用率为26．3％。各级党委写作组为报纸担负了绝大部分重要稿件的写作任务，不仅写一般新闻、通讯，还采写典型报道和成组报道，撰写言论和文章，组织专页，供给图片。各级党委写作组还经常地把当地的工作情况和当地党委对报道的意见，及时告诉报社编辑部。到编辑部谈报道、谈情况的写作组，每天都有四、五个。总之，深入地开展全党办报运动，便为办好党报造成了极其有利的形势。
    二
    为了坚决贯彻全党办报的方针，安徽日报从整风反右以来，便深入地开展了两条办报路线的斗争。对于右派分子、右倾机会主义分子反对党的领导，利用报纸宣传资产阶级思想，坚持“专家办报”路线的反党活动，作了彻底的揭发和批判，进一步树立了无产阶级的世界观，树立了坚决服从党的领导的思想，在两次整风反右以后，又通过经常性的政治思想工作，反复地进行全党办报的教育，指出知识分子的思想改造，是一个长期的、艰苦的过程。号召大家自觉地进行思想改造，彻底地破资产阶级世界观，巩固地立无产阶级世界观，当好党的喉舌和耳目。不仅要在大的方面听党的话，而且要在所有的方面听党的话；不仅要主动地请党委对报道工作提出指示，而且认真研究党委为什么作这样的指示，如何才能准确、全面、有力地加以贯彻；不仅要坚决、及时地贯彻党委的每一个指示，而且要做到党委正在考虑什么，便同时去研究这一方面的问题，和党委步调一致，心心相印；不仅要绝对服从省委的领导，而且要坚决地依靠各级党委的支持，和各方面密切协作，强调只有在紧密地依靠各级党的骨干、依靠全党的力量，才能提高报纸的思想性、指导性，更好地联系实际、联系群众，完成大跃进形势对报纸提出的新任务。为了加强思想改造，安徽日报从大办钢铁以来，一直坚持了干部轮流下放，参加体力劳动、参加基层工作的制度，先后下放到人民公社的干部已有八十二人。这对提高劳动观点，增长生产知识，培养干部密切结合实际的作风，都有显著的效果。
    在彻底地解决了报纸和党的关系的基础上，安徽日报编委会又制订一系列的制度。如：学习党中央方针、政策和中央负责人文章的制度；参加党委有关会议，及时传达和研究贯彻的制度；每月向省委送审报道计划、言论计划的制度；每周向省委负责人报告一周选题安排情况的制度；学习省委负责人文章和研究省委修改过的重要稿件的制度；以及处理地（市）、县委负责人来稿的规定，处理地（市）委负责人签发稿件的规定，认真接待党委写作组来访的规定等等。编委会还决定在采通部配备专职干部，专门管理党委写作组的来稿，接待写作组来访，编辑“采访与通讯”刊物。对于地方记者站，则根据省委的规定交给所在地的党委领导。要求他们及时把编辑部的要求告诉当地党委，由当地党委根据编辑部的要求和当地的情况，制订本地区的报道计划，记者站则在当地党委统一安排下，完成其指定的任务。同时要求记者每到一处采访，都要依靠当地党委，和写作组人员与通讯员密切协作，和他们一道采访，相互帮助，相互学习。
    采取上述措施以后，安徽日报编辑部的绝大部分工作人员，能够绝对服从省委的领导，对于争取各级党委来参加报纸工作，也一直是积极的、主动的、热情的。每当省委布置了什么重大的任务，在报道上提出了指示，编辑部便立即加以讨论，研究如何在报纸上正确、有力地反映出来；并把编辑部的要求迅速传达到各级党委写作组，依靠他们及时组织报道。编辑部经常约请各级党委负责人通过总结本地区的工作，就实论虚，为报纸撰写言论和文章。对于党委负责人的来稿，只要内容有可取之处，即使初稿较差，都反复地补充、改写，决不轻易弃置。在组织重点稿件时，编辑能够将报道意图、稿件的主题思想以至结构等等，作明确、具体的交代，尽可能在写作业务上发挥主导作用。有些重大典型或战役性的报道，则由报社派人与党委写作组合作采写。编辑部还通过通讯刊物，传达报社根据中央和省委的指示拟定的宣传要求，报道各地党委负责人如何加强对写作工作的领导，及时传播各地党委写作组成功的工作经验，定期公布各地写作组来稿情况，促进写作组之间的竞赛。
    自从把记者站交给当地党委领导以来，绝大部分记者对于当地党委的领导，也是坚决服从的，思想上、工作上都有了比较明显的进步。如本报马鞍山记者站，做到了一切依靠马鞍山市委进行工作，只要市委提出什么任务，总是抓紧时间迅速完成。党委对什么问题特别关心，记者便深入下去，进行调查研究，主动做党委的耳目。
    三
    全党办报运动的意义是十分巨大的。深入开展全党办报运动以来，我们初步体会有以下一些收获：
    第一，抓方向性、关键性和重大战役性的报道，更及时、更突出。过去，报纸在党的领导下，对于抓方向性、关键性的问题也是注意的，但是怎样才能把这些问题牢牢地抓住，大做文章，讲得准，讲得透，还是存在着许多困难的。普遍开展全党办报运动以后，情况便有了很大的改变。编辑部在明确了宣传方向以后，只要依靠各级党委，做好组织工作，在方向性、关键性的问题上大做文章、组织大规模的战役性的报道，就不会是力不从心，而是比较得心应手了。去年春季，有少数人吹起一股冷风，发出所谓“指标越低越好”的右倾谬论。这时，省委指示要顶住逆流，把春季大生产运动热烈开展起来，并明确地提出了三个鲜明的口号：“大宣传，鼓干劲”，“大检查，抓备耕”，“大竞赛，夺丰收”。根据这一指示，报纸编辑部立即组织各级党委写作组共同完成这一报道任务。不到十天，编辑部就收到这方面的来稿三百多篇，从中挑选了五十多篇，连续组织了五个整版的报道，进行了集中、突出的宣传，并以省委三个口号为题，连续发表了三篇社论。这些稿件贯彻了反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，表达了全省人民继续争上游的雄心大志，宣传了热火朝天的红旗竞赛运动，介绍了夺取春季大生产运动胜利的种种措施。去年12月，省委轻工业会议号召加速发展轻工业，报社根据省委的指示，立即组织各地党委写作组集中力量加强轻工业的宣传。在他们的大力支持下，报纸在一个多月内便发表了近一百篇稿件，这些稿件从实现省委号召的必要性和可能性，如何进一步贯彻党的大办轻工业的方针，调动广大群众的积极性，以及如何解决高速度发展轻工业中的关键性问题等等方面，有计划地进行了宣传，有概括、有典型，对大办轻工业的群众运动起了一定的推动作用。近两年来的很多重要战役性的报道，也都是依靠各地党委写作组来完成的。如去年庆祝建国十周年的宣传，发稿数字庞大，材料浩如烟海，必须认真加以挑选、补充、整理。由于我们依靠省委，明确了报道意图，并组织各级党委写作组共同完成，便在短时期内发表了三十几个专页、二百多篇稿件，内容大都比较充实。今年春季我省召开农业群英会，有四十个地委、县委写作组，派来了五十个写作干部，担负了绝大部分稿件的写作任务，各地党委写作组还组织了许多人就地采访，补充材料，做到了会议上采访和会外采访结合起来。因而在八、九天的时间内，便完成了十二万字、八个专页的采写任务。
    第二，言论的数量大大增加，质量也有所提高。据统计，从1959年7月到今年4月份，在报纸上发表的各地、市、县委书记撰写的社论有三十二篇，评论有三十六篇，文章一百五十六篇。这些言论和文章，都是总结各地成功经验，或评介某些新事物、新问题，结合先进典型写的，一般都能鲜明地体现党的思想，分析问题较透。今年3、4月份安徽日报发表的言论中，内部评报插红旗的有四十三篇，其中党委负责同志和写作组写的就有二十七篇，占一半以上。
    第三，各级党委挑选典型，红旗插得多，插得准。过去是报社找典型，现在是各级党委挑出典型来向报社推荐。各级党委在领导实际工作中，本来就是抓典型来指导全面的，掌握的典型多，报道时能够优中选优，并对典型事物的意义作准确而深刻的分析。去年编辑部准备在报纸上介绍一个先进的生产队，当把这个要求向阜阳地委提出后，地委立即指示几个县委推荐报道对象；阜阳县委根据地委的指示，在全县公社党委书记会议上布置每个公社自报一个典型的生产队，拿到会上来评比。经过三次讨论研究，好中挑好，最后确定介绍桃园生产队。县委、地委负责同志还对写出来的每一篇稿件，反复进行研究修改，发表后，全省生产队普遍引为学习的榜样。今年3月间，由合肥市委组织的文教大协作的报道，也是一个比较突出的例子。为了完成这一组意义重大的典型报道，合肥市委第一书记和市委分管文教的书记亲自挂帅，召开了几次座谈会，谈情况、谈问题、谈经验，由市委负责同志提出观点，确定选题，抽调了十一个干部专门突击，分头去作专题采访，稿子写好后，又经市委书记亲自修改，十多天时间内，便写成了两个多版的稿件，有新闻、社论、通讯、经验，对于文教大协作这一新生事物作了集中、有力的宣传。其它如涡阳纪伦寨由穷变富、蚌埠红五女白手起家办工厂、安庆丝光染织厂用穷办法办大事等等比较成功的典型报道，也都是由各地党委推荐的。
    第四，进一步解决了报道中的方面和地区的平衡问题。过去我们也力求做到报道上的平衡，但是，要很好地解决这个问题，光靠编辑部的努力还是不行的，不论在人力和对情况的了解等方面，我们都有所限制。各个地区、各个部门都建立了党委写作组以后，各个地区、各个部门的新成就、新经验、新的问题都能及时地反映到编辑部来，这就大大有利于解决平衡问题，消灭报道中的所谓“空白地区”和“空白点”。大跃进以来，由于各级党委的大力支持，我们不仅集中、突出地报道了经济建设方面的大跃进，对教育、文化、科学、卫生、体育等方面的报道也有相当的改进。如来安县的全民办科学、全民学哲学，巢县司集乡的文化工作，萧县黄口镇的扫盲工作，蚌埠的教育革命，以及最近报道的合肥市文教大协作等等，都是影响较大的典型报道。在地区平衡方面，过去来稿很少、经常不见报的一些地方，如天长、岳西、广德、含山、和县等县，建立写作组以来，不仅给报社寄来大批稿件，而且稿件质量也都比过去有所提高，经常有稿见报。据统计，从去年第三季度到今年4月份，天长县委写作组共发稿二百五十五篇，采用六十一篇，岳西县委共发稿七十三篇，采用十八篇。
      第五，地方记者站的力量得到了更合理的使用。记者站交给当地党委领导以后，和党委的关系更密切了，当地党委对他们的领导也更具体、更经常，而且记者站可以和当地党委写作组更好地分工协作。这便推动了记者站和实际工作的结合，使记者站把主要力量用于深入调查研究，抓好具有重大意义的典型报道。如蚌埠记者站采写的稿件，今年第一季度的典型报道，已由去年占发稿总数的三分之一左右，迅速增加到三分之二以上。在开展全民轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动中，这个站的同志深入采访，抓住先进单位大做文章，对蚌埠玻璃厂迅速实现保温瓶生产手工操作机械化、煤气化、连续化，接连作了三次系统、集中、突出的报道，这些稿件发表后，在编辑部评报中都被插上了红旗。
    第六，全党办报推动了全党用报。随着全党办报运动的发展，各级党委都把为报纸写稿同指导本地区、本部门的工作有机地结合起来，对运用报纸也就更为关心。阜阳县桃园生产队的领导经验在安徽日报上发表后，阜阳地委立即在县委书记会议上作了部署，要求各地认真学习桃园队的经验，开展一个学桃园、赶桃园的竞赛热潮。去年安徽日报发表太湖制定农业生产操作规程的新闻、社论后，全省绝大多数县委、公社党委都学习、推广了这一经验。
    第七，全党办报运动推动了调查研究、总结工作。去年东至县实现了耕牛满怀，县委确定进行报道以后，认真地从总结经验入手，由分管畜牧业的书记召开七十五名畜牧兽医人员和技术干部的会议，多次进行座谈，同时派写作组的同志深入公社调查访问，掌握了丰富的材料，再经过集体研究，分析提高，反复修改，结果写成了“东至县耕畜满怀的经验”，质量很好。安徽日报发表后，中央有关部门还把这篇文章汇编入册，作为典型向各地推荐。
    第八，全党办报运动培养了写作队伍。党委写作组的同志通过为报纸写稿，经常和党委领导同志一起下乡下厂，了解情况，学习理论，研究问题，思想水平和写作水平普遍有了提高。他们中间有的人，从写动态新闻开始，逐步学会写典型报道、通讯、特写、经验文章和言论，有的还学会写社论和组织整版的专页报道。这样就为进一步提高报纸的宣传质量，提供了有力的保证。
    两年多来，安徽日报在省委的领导下，贯彻全党办报方针虽然取得了一定的成绩，但是，我们的水平还远远不能适应党报工作的需要，工作中的缺点和问题还很多。我们必须努力学习毛泽东思想，学习党的方针、政策，加强和实际工作的联系，学习人民日报和各兄弟报纸的经验，为提高报纸宣传的理论性、思想性、指导性而斗争。
