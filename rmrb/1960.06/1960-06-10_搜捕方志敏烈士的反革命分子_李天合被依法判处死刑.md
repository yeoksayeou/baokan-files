Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th - The Yumen City People's Court of Gansu Province recently held a sentencing rally attended by more than 20,000 people, sentencing the counter-revolutionary element Li Tianhe, who hunted down Martyr Fang Zhimin, to death according to law, and executed him immediately.

The counter-revolutionary element Li Tianhe, originally named Xiao Xinghan, joined Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary army in 1931 and repeatedly followed the counter-revolutionary army to attack the Red Army base areas. He consistently plundered people's property, raped women, and engaged in counter-communist and anti-people criminal activities. In January 1935, he followed the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army to attack the Huaiyushan Red Army base area at the junction of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces. At that time, the Red Army, in order to preserve its strength, broke through enemy forces more than ten times its size and transferred to other areas. The counter-revolutionary element Li Tianhe, in order to curry favor with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, actively searched for and arrested our scattered personnel everywhere, and personally searched for and arrested Comrade Fang Zhimin, Chairman of the 10th Army Group of the Red Army. Later, Comrade Fang Zhimin was heroically unyielding and was killed in Nanchang. Because of this "great achievement," Li Tianhe was promoted and heavily rewarded by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group.

After liberation, Li Tianhe changed his name, fabricated his history, and sneaked into Xinminbao, Yumen City, Gansu Province, continuing to be an enemy of the people. During his concealment, he wantonly spread rumors to incite the masses, sabotage the government's various policies and decrees, steal and destroy the property of the state and agricultural cooperatives, and repeatedly raped women, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in a frenzy. After investigation by the masses and thorough investigation by the relevant authorities, this extremely wicked counter-revolutionary element, who had been hiding for ten years, whose hands were stained with the blood of revolutionary martyrs, and who had consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, finally received the punishment he deserved under the law.

    搜捕方志敏烈士的反革命分子
    李天合被依法判处死刑
    新华社兰州9日电　甘肃省玉门市人民法院最近举行有两万多名群众参加的宣判大会，将搜捕方志敏烈士的反革命分子李天合依法判处死刑，并立即执行。
    反革命分子李天合原名萧兴汉，1931年参加蒋介石反革命军队，多次随反革命军队向红军根据地进攻，并一贯掠夺民财，奸淫妇女，进行反共反人民的罪恶活动。1935年1月，他随国民党反革命军队向安徽、江西、浙江三省交界处的怀玉山红军根据地进攻。当时红军为保存有生力量，突破了十倍以上的敌人兵力，转移到其他地区。反革命分子李天合为了向蒋介石反动集团邀功请赏，积极地四处搜捕我失散人员，亲手搜寻逮捕了红十军团政治委员会主席方志敏同志，后来方志敏同志英勇不屈被杀害于南昌。由于这件“大功”，李天合受到蒋介石反动集团的提升和重赏。
    解放后，李天合改名换姓，伪造历史，潜来甘肃省玉门市新民堡，继续与人民为敌，在潜藏期间，大肆造谣煽惑群众，破坏政府各项政策法令，盗窃和破坏国家与农业合作社的财产，并多次奸污妇女，狂妄地进行反革命活动。在广大群众的检举揭发并经有关机关的周密调查，这个隐藏了十年之久、双手沾满革命烈士鲜血，并在解放后一贯进行反革命活动的罪大恶极的反革命分子，终于受到了应有的法律制裁。
