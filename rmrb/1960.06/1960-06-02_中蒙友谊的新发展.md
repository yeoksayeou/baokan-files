    New Development of Sino-Mongolian Friendship
    By our reporters Yu Minsheng and Peng Fengfeng
    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi returned home, laden with the profound friendship of the Mongolian people.
    During the friendly visit of the Chinese guests to the Mongolian People's Republic, they were met with grand and warm welcomes everywhere by the Mongolian people. From cities to grasslands, from factories to farms and ranches, whether elderly herdsmen, young workers, or children wearing red scarves, all used the greatest enthusiasm and the best wishes to welcome Premier Zhou. Bright red flags, flowers of friendship, the sincere feelings of workers and herdsmen, the joyful laughter of children, so many exciting scenes, so many words expressing brotherly feelings, are engraved in people's memories and will never be forgotten.
    Chairman Tsedenbal once said: "The days that the esteemed Comrade Zhou Enlai spent with us have become a true festival of brotherly friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people." These words summarize the deep friendship of the Mongolian people for the Chinese people. During these days, Ulaanbaatar has been dressed up to welcome distinguished guests. In the center of Sukhbaatar Square, the national flags of China and Mongolia and red flags were hung high every day. The huge slogan on the Government Building next to the square was particularly eye-catching, which read: "Long Live the Brotherly Friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese People!" The people of Ulaanbaatar were immersed in the joy of friendship. Every day, as long as the citizens saw Premier Zhou's car approaching from afar, they would automatically line up on both sides of the road and wave enthusiastically to Premier Zhou Enlai to pay their respects. The simple and ardent scene of the herdsmen of the Kharkhorin grassland welcoming Premier Zhou was even more moving. It is said that in order to fulfill the wishes of the herdsmen to welcome Premier Zhou, the Mongolian government sent a plane to Kharkhorin grassland for a trial flight as early as half a month ago. A large plane had never landed here before, but the grassland was flat and the trial flight was successful. Premier Zhou Enlai, as a precious guest of the Kharkhorin herdsmen, finally took a special plane to the grassland on May 29 for a visit. The long-awaited herdsmen came from all directions of the Kharkhorin grassland to welcome Premier Zhou. When Premier Zhou Enlai stepped off the plane and came among the herdsmen, an old herdsman stepped forward and presented Premier Zhou with a Hada and dairy products. The herdsmen expressed their highest respect to the precious guests with the traditional Mongolian etiquette. Not only the old and the enthusiastic young people, but also the Mongolian children expressed their pure feelings for the Chinese guests. On the eve of International Children's Day, the children of Ulaanbaatar spent a very happy morning with Premier Zhou and Chairman Tsedenbal. On this day, the Mongolian Children's Palace was decorated very beautifully. Thousands of children extended from outside the gate to every study room of the Children's Palace, lined up to welcome the Chinese distinguished guest uncle. Premier Zhou played chess, took pictures, and played games with the children. After Premier Zhou played a few moves with a Young Pioneer, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Premier Zhou lost to you!" which made the child laugh with joy. Little photographers surrounded Premier Zhou to take pictures. Premier Zhou asked Chairman Tsedenbal to join him in the lens of the little photographers to fulfill their wishes. After Premier Zhou watched the song and dance performances of the children, he spoke to the children, wishing them good health, good study, good labor, and a happy Children's Day. The children clapped and cheered again and again to thank Premier Zhou for his encouragement.
    The Mongolian workers not only showed the ardent enthusiasm of the working class for Premier Zhou Enlai's visit, but also took practical actions to increase production to welcome the distinguished guests. The employees of the woolen textile factory and the shoe factory launched a production competition to welcome Premier Zhou and achieved outstanding results. When Premier Zhou came to visit the factory, the workers presented the red flags of victory they had won in the production competition to Premier Zhou.
    During the tour, the Chinese guests personally saw that the workers of China and Mongolia worked side by side and established close feelings in their labor. What exciting scenes of friendship those were! In the woolen textile factory, Mongolian workers used the affectionate term "master" to refer to the Chinese technicians who helped with the construction. On the construction sites in cities and grasslands, examples of close cooperation between the two countries' workers can be seen everywhere. Almost every Mongolian comrade can tell some stories of Sino-Mongolian friendship that they have personally experienced. Mongolian construction worker Dakharjab said that he and Chinese workers had worked together for four years, loved each other, and established a brotherly relationship. This friendship between the working classes of the two countries will be further consolidated and developed in socialist construction. Dashnyam, the president of the "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative," said that their cooperative was named "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship," which is a concrete manifestation of the friendship between the collective farmers and herdsmen of the two countries. He thanked the Chinese people for donating agricultural machines and feed seeds to the cooperative. Mongolian comrades often talk about the Chinese people helping Mongolia build factories, enterprises, water conservancy projects, bridges, and roads. Speaking of these, they said with such passion of friendship: "This fully embodies the brotherly friendship of mutual assistance between the people of the two countries." Whenever this happened, the Chinese guests could not help but think of the Mongolian people's help to China. Over the past few years, through trade relations, the Mongolian People's Republic has supplied China with a huge number of draft horses, and in 1958, it also donated 15,000 draft horses to China to support China's Great Leap Forward. Our two peoples cooperate so closely and support each other, constantly promoting the development of our two countries' socialist cause. When Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech at the banquet held by Premier Zhou Enlai, he said that China and Mongolia should learn from each other and support each other. Chinese comrades should learn from Mongolian comrades the experience of building factories on the plateau, building water conservancy projects on the grassland, surveying geology, and developing agriculture and animal husbandry. Mutual learning is a manifestation of sincere friendship.
    During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held sincere and friendly talks with Chairman Tsedenbal, and the two sides exchanged views on specific issues of further consolidating and developing the brotherly friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries, as well as major international issues. And reached a complete consensus. Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal also signed the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement, and the Joint Declaration of the two governments on behalf of China and Mongolia. After the signing, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal attended the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Rally held by nearly 80,000 Ulaanbaatar citizens. In their speeches at this grand rally, they unanimously emphasized that the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance will further promote the development of friendly relations and socialist cause between the two countries. At that time, nearly 80,000 people cheered enthusiastically, celebrating the new development of Sino-Mongolian friendship.
    Now, Premier Zhou has concluded his visit to the Mongolian People's Republic. May the people of China and Mongolia always cooperate closely and move forward hand in hand, and achieve even more brilliant achievements in the lofty cause of building socialism and defending world peace!

    中蒙友谊的新发展
    本报记者　于民生、彭逢熢
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理满载着蒙古人民的深厚友谊回国了。
    中国贵宾在蒙古人民共和国进行友好访问的日子里，到处都受到了蒙古人民盛大的、热烈的欢迎。从城市到草原，从工厂到农牧场，无论是年老的牧民，年青的工人，还是带着红领巾的儿童，都用最大的热情，最好的祝愿来欢迎周总理。鲜艳的红旗，友谊的鲜花，工人和牧民们诚挚的感情，孩子们欢乐的笑声，多少激动人心的场面，多少表达兄弟情谊的话语，都铭刻在人们的记忆里，永志不忘。
    泽登巴尔主席曾经说过：“敬爱的周恩来同志和我们相处在一起的日子，已经变成了蒙中人民兄弟友谊的真正的节日。”这些话概括了蒙古人民对中国人民的深厚友情。这些天来，乌兰巴托市一直是盛装迎贵宾。苏赫巴托尔广场中心，天天高挂着中蒙两国的国旗和红旗。紧靠着广场的政府大厦上的巨幅标语特别醒目，那上面写道：“蒙中人民兄弟友谊万岁！”乌兰巴托市人民沉醉在友谊的欢乐中，每天，市民们只要远远看到周总理乘坐的汽车到来的时候，就自动排列在马路两旁，热情迸发地向周恩来总理挥手致敬。哈拉和林草原牧民欢迎周总理的纯朴而炽热的情景，更加动人。据说，蒙古政府为了满足牧民们欢迎周总理的愿望，早在半个月以前，就派飞机到哈拉和林草原试航。这里还从来没有降落过大型飞机，但是草原平坦，试航成功了，周恩来总理作为哈拉和林牧民珍贵的客人，终于5月29日坐专机到草原进行访问。期待已久的牧民们从哈拉和林草原的四面八方赶来欢迎周总理。当周恩来总理走下飞机来到牧民群众中的时候，一位老牧民赶上前去，向周总理敬献哈达和奶食品，牧民们用蒙古民族传统的礼节表达了对珍贵客人的崇高的敬意。不仅是龙钟的长者，热情的青年，就是那些蒙古少年儿童们也对中国客人表达着他们纯真的感情。在六一儿童节的前夕，乌兰巴托市的少年儿童和周总理、泽登巴尔主席一块度过了一个十分快乐的早晨。这一天，蒙古少年宫打扮得很漂亮，成千的儿童们从大门外一直伸延到少年宫的每个学习室，列队夹道欢迎中国的贵宾伯伯。周总理和孩子们下棋、照像、玩游戏。周总理和一个少先队员下了几步棋后，陈毅副总理说，“周总理输给你了！”逗得这个孩子满心欢乐的笑起来。小摄影师们围着周总理拍照，周总理请泽登巴尔主席一块让小摄影师摄入镜头，满足了他们的愿望。周总理看完少年儿童们的歌舞表演以后，对儿童们讲了话，祝儿童们身体好、学习好、劳动好，好好过儿童节。儿童们一次再一次的鼓掌、欢呼，感谢周总理的勉励。
    蒙古工人对周恩来总理的来访，不仅表现了工人阶级的炽热的盛情，而且他们还要以增加生产的实际行动来迎接贵宾。毛纺织厂和皮鞋厂的职工们就为了迎接周总理开展生产竞赛，取得了出色的成就。周总理来到工厂参观的时候，工人们把他们在生产竞赛中得到的优胜红旗献给周总理。
    在参观访问中，中国客人们亲自看到，中蒙两国工人并肩劳动，在劳动中建立了亲密的感情。那是一些多么激动人心的友谊情景啊！在毛纺织厂里，蒙古工人用“师傅”这个亲切的字眼称呼帮助建设的中国技术人员。在城市和草原的建筑工地上，两国工人的亲密合作事例，随处可见。几乎每一位蒙古同志都能讲出一些他们亲身经历蒙中友谊的故事来。蒙古建筑工人达哈尔扎布说，他和中国工人在一块工作了四年，彼此相亲相爱，建立了亲如手足的兄弟关系，两国工人阶级的这种友谊，将在社会主义建设中更加巩固发展。“蒙中友谊合作社”社长达什尼亚木说，他们的合作社以“蒙中友谊”命名，就是实现了集体化的两国农牧民友谊的具体表现。他感谢中国人民赠送合作社农业机器和饲料种子。蒙古同志经常谈起中国人民帮助蒙古兴建工厂、企业、兴修水利、修建桥梁、马路的事情。谈起这些，他们是那样地满怀友谊的激情说：“这充分地体现了两国人民相互帮助的兄弟友谊。”每当这个时候，就使中国客人禁不住想起了蒙古人民对中国的帮助来。几年来，通过贸易关系，蒙古人民共和国曾经供应我国数目巨大的耕马，在1958年还赠送给我国一万五千匹耕马，支援了我国的大跃进。我们两国人民就是这样的亲密合作，相互支援，不断地促进我们两国的社会主义事业的发展。陈毅副总理在周恩来总理举行的答谢宴会上致词的时候曾经说，中蒙两国应该互相学习，互相支援。中国同志应该学习蒙古同志在高原建工厂，在草原修水利、勘察地质和发展农牧业的经验。相互学习就是真诚友谊的表现。
    在访问期间，周恩来总理同泽登巴尔主席举行了真诚友好的会谈，双方就进一步巩固和发展两国间兄弟友谊和全面合作的具体问题以及国际间的重大问题交换了意见。并且取得了完全一致的看法。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席还代表中蒙两国签订了中蒙友好互助条约、经济技术援助协定和两国政府的联合声明。在签字以后，周恩来总理又和泽登巴尔主席一起出席了近八万乌兰巴托市民举行的蒙中友谊集会，他们在这个盛大集会上的讲话中，一致强调指出，中蒙友好互助条约的签订，将进一步促进两国友好关系和社会主义事业的发展。那时候，近八万群众齐声热烈欢呼，庆祝中蒙友谊的新发展。
    现在，周总理已经结束了对蒙古人民共和国的访问。愿中蒙两国人民，永远紧密合作，携手前进，在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的崇高事业中取得更加辉煌的成就！（附图片）
