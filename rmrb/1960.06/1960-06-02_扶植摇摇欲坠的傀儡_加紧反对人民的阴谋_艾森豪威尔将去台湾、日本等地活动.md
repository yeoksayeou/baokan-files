Xinhua News Agency, June 1st, Washington dispatch: After sabotaging the four-power summit conference, U.S. President Eisenhower decided to "visit" Taiwan on the 18th in order to further strengthen U.S. control over the Chiang Kai-shek group and to use this Chinese territory occupied by the United States as a base to intensify aggression and military provocations against China.

The decision was announced by White House Press Secretary Hagerty shortly before Eisenhower met with representatives of Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries currently holding a council meeting in Washington.

Recently, the powerful mass movements against U.S. oppression and dictatorial rule launched by the broad masses of people in South Korea, Japan, Turkey, and other countries have caused some of the puppets fostered by the United States to collapse and others to become precarious. In order to strengthen U.S. rule over these countries and suppress the patriotic movements of the people, in addition to going to Taiwan, Eisenhower will also go to other places in the Far East, while further plotting activities hostile to the people of Asian countries. According to Hagerty, he will leave Washington on the 12th, visit the Philippines from the 14th to the 16th or 17th, inspect U.S. military bases in Okinawa on the 19th, arrive in Japan on the afternoon of the 19th to meet with the Nobusuke Kishi government, leave Japan on the morning of the 22nd to visit South Korea and inspect the U.S. invasion troops stationed in South Korea, and leave South Korea on the evening of the 22nd to return home via Japan.

According to United Press International, in view of the increasing struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, Eisenhower is very worried about his reception in Japan. Therefore, he decided to spend only one night at an airport on the outskirts of Tokyo when he passes through Japan on his way back from South Korea, instead of staying overnight at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo as originally planned, in an attempt to "reduce the opportunities for the Japanese public to hold demonstrations against Eisenhower."

    扶植摇摇欲坠的傀儡　加紧反对人民的阴谋
    艾森豪威尔将去台湾、日本等地活动
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：在破坏了四国政府首脑会议后，美国总统艾森豪威尔决定在18日“访问”台湾，以便进一步加强美国对蒋介石集团的控制，并且以美国所侵占的这块中国领土为基地，加紧对中国的侵略和军事挑衅。
    这个决定是在艾森豪威尔同目前在华盛顿举行理事会会议的东南亚条约组织国家的代表会晤前不久，由白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂宣布的。
    近来南朝鲜、日本、土耳其等国广大人民展开的反对美国压迫和独裁统治的强大群众运动，使美国豢养的这些傀儡们有的坍倒、有的岌岌可危。为了加强美国对这些国家的统治和镇压人民的爱国运动，除了去台湾之外，艾森豪威尔还将到远东其他地方，同时并进一步策划同亚洲各国人民为敌的活动。据哈格蒂宣布，他将在12日离开华盛顿，14日至16日或17日访问菲律宾，19日到冲绳视察美国军事基地，19日下午抵达日本同岸信介政府会晤，22日早上离开日本前往访问南朝鲜和视察美国驻南朝鲜的侵略部队，22日晚上离开南朝鲜取道日本返国。
    据合众国际社报道，鉴于日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争日益高涨，艾森豪威尔对他在日本的遭遇感到很担心。因此，他决定在访问南朝鲜后途经日本返国时只在东京郊外的机场上过夜，而不是像原来打算的那样在美国驻东京大使馆过夜，企图这样来“减少日本公众举行反对艾森豪威尔的示威的机会”。
