    Beat the Dog in the Water!
    Bing Xin
    The No. 1 war-monger, Eisenhower, has suffered three consecutive blows: the spy plane he sent was shot down, his invasion plot was exposed; his invitation to visit the Soviet Union was angrily withdrawn by the Soviet Union; and his visit to Japan to consolidate his puppet regime was canceled by his puppet in fear of the power of the Japanese people's opposition. After losing his footing and not knowing whether to advance or retreat, this shameless habitual thief still plucked up his courage, braced himself, and braved the deafening artillery fire of our heroic coastal defense soldiers towards the Taiwan Strait, sneaking into Taiwan to carry out the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas" in an attempt to permanently occupy our sacred territory. This is what our 650 million people will resolutely not tolerate!
    The U.S. imperialists have been entrenched in Taiwan for a full ten years today. Taiwan has been China's sacred territory since ancient times, which is an indisputable ironclad fact known to all. In order to occupy a base for invading mainland China, the U.S. imperialists have stationed a large number of army, navy, and air force personnel on our treasure island to exploit Taiwan's resources, enslave our Taiwan compatriots, and pose a war threat to China. These sinful facts, throughout these three thousand six hundred and fifty days and nights, our 650 million people have never forgotten for a single moment!
    Eisenhower will remember the experience of sneaking through the Taiwan Strait in fear and tension under the strict protection of warships and aircraft on June 17th and 19th! The soaring anger and infinite contempt of the Chinese people were all shot at this rat scurrying across the street in the form of thunderous Chinese artillery shells. Let him know that this angry expression of ours is just the beginning, and even greater and denser artillery fire is yet to come! Our 650 million people will use all kinds of weapons to unleash the roar of struggle, to announce to the people of the world: the U.S. aggressors have done all kinds of bad things, creating tension everywhere, occupying other countries' lands, and oppressing people. Hundreds of millions of awakened people have already stood up and united. In Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other places, people are constantly attacking the heinous U.S. imperialists with indomitable and overwhelming force. The U.S. imperialists' pirate ship has been drifting in the raging waves, with its mast broken and rudder lost, sinking imminently. The days of their rampaging are gone forever!
    Eisenhower hastily and despondently ended his most disgraceful trip under the impact of the angry tide of the Far Eastern people and sneaked back to Washington. This is a victory for the people's power and a victory for the forces of peace. But we must never let him return to his lair to quietly lick his wounds and conspire with his cronies to come up with any more bad ideas. Beat the dog in the water! If we don't pursue him, we cannot completely eliminate this scourge of the people of the world! We must remember that Taiwan is still in their hands, and our compatriots have suffered these years of humiliation and devastation under their iron hooves. We must never let our compatriots endure their enslavement again, and we must never let our sacred territory endure their trampling again. We must unite strongly, use all weapons, exert all our strength, with the force of a thunderbolt, and the speed of lightning, sound the horn, beat the drums, and relentlessly pursue this gang of incorrigible robbers, drive them out of Taiwan, drive them out of Japan, drive them out of South Korea, drive them out of the Philippines, drive them out of the places they shouldn't be staying, and drive them back to their old home!

    穷寇必追！
    冰心
    第一号战争贩子艾森豪威尔，接连挨了三下迎头大棒：他派遣的间谍飞机被打落了，侵略阴谋被揭露了；他到苏联访问的邀请，也被苏联愤怒地撤消了；他到日本去巩固走狗政权的访问，在日本人民的反对威力之下，被他的走狗惶恐地取消了。而这个强颜无耻的惯盗，在进退失据之后，还壮着胆子，硬着头皮，冒着我们英勇的海防战士向台湾海峡射出的震天的炮火，灰溜溜地溜到台湾，去进行制造“两个中国”企图永久侵占我们神圣领土的阴谋，这是我们六亿五千万人民所坚决不能容忍的！
    美帝国主义者赖在台湾到今天已整整十年了。台湾自古以来，就是中国的神圣领土，这是天下皆知不容争辩的铁一般的事实。美帝国主义者为了占据一块侵略中国大陆的进攻基地，在我们的宝岛上驻扎了大量的陆海空军，来榨取我们台湾的资源，奴役我们台湾的同胞，来对中国进行战争威胁。这些罪恶的事实，在这三千六百五十个日日夜夜之中，我们六亿五千万人民，一时一刻也没有忘记！
    艾森豪威尔他会记得，当6月17日和19日这两天，他在军舰飞机的严密保护之下，惶恐紧张地溜过台湾海峡的经历吧！中国人民的冲天的愤怒和无限的鄙夷，都在中国人民的震天炮弹声中，射向这只狼狈过街的老鼠。让他晓得我们这愤怒的表示还不过是个开始，更大更密的炮火，还在后头！我们六亿五千万人民，将以各种各样的武器，发出斗争的怒吼，来周告普天下人民：美国侵略者做尽了坏事，他们到处制造紧张局势，到处侵占别国土地，压迫人民。亿万的觉悟的人民已经站立起来、团结起来了。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等地，人民以不屈不挠的、排山倒海的力量，向着万恶的美帝国主义者，不断地冲击。美帝国主义者这只贼船已经漂泊在汪洋怒潮之中，桅折舵断，沉没在即，他们横冲直撞的日子，已经一去不复返了！
    艾森豪威尔在远东人民的怒潮冲击之下，急急忙忙失魂落魄地结束了他的最丢丑的旅行，溜回到华盛顿去，这是人民力量的胜利，是和平力量的胜利。但是我们决不能让他回到窝里安安静静地去舐他的创伤，去和他的狐群狗党再商量出什么坏主意，穷寇必追，不追就不能彻底消灭这个世界人民的祸害！我们要记住台湾还在他们的手里，我们的同胞们已经在他们的铁蹄下受了这些年的凌辱摧残，我们决不能让我们的同胞再忍受他们的奴役，我们决不能让我们神圣的国土再忍受他们的践踏，我们一定要坚强地团结起来，用一切的武器，尽一切的力量，以雷霆万钧之力，疾风掣电之势，吹起号角，擂起战鼓，穷追这伙怙恶不悛的强盗，把他们赶出台湾，赶出日本，赶出南朝鲜，赶出菲律宾，赶出他们所不应该呆的地方，把他们赶回老家去！
