    Beijing, June 3rd. The head of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society issued a statement on June 3rd regarding the Greek Communist Party's demand to abolish the special law that unreasonably prohibits the Greek Communist Party's activities, stating that on May 3rd of this year, the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party sent a memorandum to the Greek government, parliament, and various Greek political parties, demanding the restoration of the Greek Communist Party's legal status. This demand from the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party is entirely reasonable and in line with the interests and aspirations of the Greek people. Chinese political science and law workers firmly support the Greek Communist Party's demand.

    The head of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society pointed out that the Greek authorities declared the Greek Communist Party illegal in 1947 to suppress domestic democratic and progressive forces, in order to clear the way for its reactionary dictatorial rule, relying on American imperialism. For more than a decade, the Greek government, relying on this reactionary decree, has intensified its betrayal of Greece's national interests, and has been wantonly suppressing and persecuting patriotic democrats at home, even unreasonably arresting the Greek national hero Glezos, attempting to kill him. Externally, the Greek Karamanlis government has agreed to allow American and West German militarists to establish atomic rocket bases and military bases on Greek territory, and has tightly bound Greece to the American chariot. All these perverse actions of the reactionary Greek government have placed the Greek people in an extremely dangerous situation. This cannot but arouse strong protests and opposition from the Greek people.

    The head of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society said: Any terrorist methods of the Greek government will absolutely not be able to stifle the just voice of the Greek people. Just as the memorandum of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party pointed out: a party representing the interests of the working class cannot be eliminated. The Greek Communist Party has always existed, and it has always stood at the forefront of the Greek people's struggle for easing tensions, for peace and democracy. The Greek people see that the Greek Communist Party is the strongest fighter in defending the national interests of Greece. Prohibiting the Greek Communist Party is not in the interest of the country.

    The head of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society concluded: The Political Science and Law Society and political and legal workers, like all the Chinese people, closely follow and support the just struggle of the Greek people and the Greek Communist Party. We express our infinite indignation at the reactionary terrorist rule of the Greek Karamanlis government. We must solemnly warn the reactionary Greek government that any measures that rely on foreign imperialism and suppress domestic patriotic and just struggles are doomed to failure. Facts have proven that all traitorous and reactionary governments will be consumed in the raging flames of the people's struggle.

    我政治法律学会负责人发表谈话
    支持希共争取合法地位的斗争
    警告希腊反动政府任何镇压措施注定要失败
    本报讯　中国政治法律学会负责人于6月3日就希腊共产党要求废除无理禁止希腊共产党活动的特别法律问题发表谈话说，今年5月3日希腊共产党中央委员会曾向希腊政府、议会和希腊各政党致送了一份备忘录，要求恢复希腊共产党的合法地位。希腊共产党中央委员会的这一要求是完全合理的，也是符合希腊人民的利益和愿望的。中国政治法律工作者坚决支持希腊共产党的要求。
    中国政治法律学会负责人指出，希腊当局在1947年宣布希腊共产党非法，是为了镇压国内的民主和进步力量，以便为它的投靠美国帝国主义的反动独裁统治扫除障碍。十几年以来，希腊政府凭借它的这种反动法令，变本加厉地出卖着希腊的民族利益，在国内大肆镇压和迫害爱国民主人士，甚至把希腊民族英雄格列索斯也无理逮捕，企图加以杀害。对外，希腊卡拉曼利斯政府同意美国和西德军国主义者在希腊的国土上建立原子火箭基地和军事基地，并且把希腊紧紧地绑在美国的战车上。希腊反动政府这一切倒行逆施已经使希腊人民置于极其危险的境地。这不能不激起希腊人民的强烈的抗议和反对。
    中国政治法律学会负责人说：希腊政府任何恐怖手段是绝对窒息不了希腊人民的正义呼声的。正像希腊共产党中央委员会的备忘录所指出的：一个代表了工人阶级的利益的政党是不可能被消灭的。希腊共产党始终存在着，并且它一直站在希腊人民争取缓和紧张局势、争取和平和民主的斗争的最前列。希腊人民看到：希腊共产党是保卫希腊民族利益最坚强的战士。禁止希腊共产党是不符合国家的利益的。
    中国政治法律学会负责人最后说：政治法律学会和政法工作者像全中国人民一样，密切关注和支持希腊人民和希腊共产党的正义斗争。我们对于希腊卡拉曼利斯政府的反动恐怖统治表示无限的愤慨。必须正告希腊反动政府，任何投靠外国帝国主义、镇压国内爱国正义斗争的措施是注定要失败的。事实已经证明，一切卖国反动政府必将在人民斗争的烈火中所焚毁。
