Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: U.S. imperialism is blatantly directing its lackey, the Kishi Nobusuke group, to intensify the suppression of the Japanese people's increasingly surging anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, met with Kishi Nobusuke yesterday to demand that Kishi suppress the Japanese people's demonstrations against Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Today, speaking at a luncheon held by the American Chamber of Commerce, he openly slandered the anti-American patriotic struggle of millions of Japanese people as "not representing the true sentiments of the Japanese people," and blatantly implied that the Kishi Nobusuke group should step up the suppression of the Japanese people's struggle. He clamored that he did not believe that Americans and Japanese "would allow a tiny minority to jeopardize U.S.-Japan relations," and also said that he was very aware of the "ability and determination of responsible Japanese leaders."

    指示岸信介集团加强镇压人民示威运动
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：美帝国主义正在明目张胆地指使它的走狗岸信介集团来加强镇压日本人民日益高涨的反美爱国正义斗争。
    美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二在昨天同岸信介会谈，要岸信介镇压日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的示威行动。今天，他在美国商会举行的一个午餐会上讲话时又公开诬蔑日本千百万人民的反美爱国斗争“不代表日本人民的真正情绪”，并且露骨地暗示要岸信介集团加紧镇压日本人民的斗争。他叫嚷说，他不相信美国人和日本人“会允许极少数人危害日美关系的行动”，还说什么：他非常知道“日本负责领袖的能力和决心”。
