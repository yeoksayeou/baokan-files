Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Religious figures in the capital held a rally today to angrily protest the "God of Plague" Eisenhower's stepping onto our country's territory of Taiwan, and resolutely support the frontline troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in using artillery to "welcome" this war "God of Plague."

    Representatives from all religious denominations across the country spoke enthusiastically at the meeting.  Xirao Jiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, spoke on behalf of Chinese Buddhists, angrily protesting Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan. He said that this war "God of Plague," after only a few days in the Far East, had become a rat scurrying across the street, beaten black and blue by the people of Asia. Yesterday, he sneaked into our territory of Taiwan in utter disgrace, spreading his plague and poison there. He said: We must warn this "God of Plague" whose mind is going: the powerful People's Republic of China and its heroic people will certainly liberate Taiwan, and will resolutely not allow these monsters and demons to continue to occupy our territory.

    Pi Shushi, Chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, emphasized at the meeting that American imperialism is not only carrying out military aggression everywhere, but also cultural aggression, such as using religion to invade our Taiwan and engaging in espionage activities everywhere. He said that in a small area like Taiwan, there are more than 7,200 missionaries, most of whom are Americans, and these American missionaries have close ties with American intelligence organizations.

    Zhao Zichen and Jiang Yizhen, Standing Committee members of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, pointed out in their speeches that the miserable experience of Eisenhower's robber trip shows that the power of the people cannot be deceived. The noose around the neck of American imperialism is tightening. There is a saying in China: "Those who do many unrighteous deeds will destroy themselves." American imperialism is doing evil all over the world in this way, and it will not live long.

    Wang Jinxi, a member of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, said that American imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, but also the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. Today, our army's artillery barrage gave the head of American imperialism a heavy blow. In the future, American imperialism will be bombarded by hundreds of millions of artillery shells from the people of the world and will be punished even more severely.

    Gala Zang, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, angrily denounced Eisenhower's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He pointed out that this conspiracy of American imperialism can only make compatriots in Taiwan and the people of the world see its imperialist nature more clearly. Eisenhower's experience in the Far East shows that American imperialism has become the most odious thing in the world.

    Meng Minghui, Vice President of the Chinese Taoist Association, said that Eisenhower is such a "God of Plague" that he cannot survive without creating tension. Wherever he goes, the people there will rise up to teach him a lesson. The artillery barrage on the Fujian front shows that Eisenhower's conspiracy for his trip to the Far East has gone bankrupt in the cannon fire.

    Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, said that the artillery fire of the frontline troops in Fujian has enhanced the morale of the people of the world and extinguished the prestige of imperialism.

    Da Piao Sheng, Deputy Director of the Islamic Association of China, said that Eisenhower's robber trip to Asia and our Taiwan is a new conspiracy by American imperialism to plan wars and create tension in Asia, and we resolutely oppose it.

    Li Depei, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, Yan Jiale, Standing Committee member of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, Li Yuhang, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Taoist Association, Zhengguo, Professor of the Chinese Buddhist Academy, Lian Qiuhang of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, Gao Guanru, Director of the Buddhist Association of China, and Yao Xianyu, Bishop of the Beijing Diocese of the Catholic Church also spoke at the meeting, representing various religious denominations.

    首都宗教界人士集会抗议“瘟神”到台湾
    我军炮声灭了帝国主义威风
    据新华社19日讯　首都宗教界人士今天举行集会，愤怒抗议“瘟神”艾森豪威尔踏上我国领土台湾，坚决拥护中国人民解放军前线部队用大炮来“迎送”这个战争“瘟神”。
    全国各教派的代表人物在会上踊跃发言，中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错在会上代表中国佛教徒愤怒抗议艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾。他说，这个战争“瘟神”到远东来不几天，就变成了一只被亚洲人民打得遍体鳞伤的过街耗子，昨天他狼狈万分地窜进了我国的领土台湾，在那里施瘟降毒。他说：我们要警告这个头脑发昏的“瘟神”：强大的中华人民共和国和它的英雄人民一定要解放台湾，坚决不让这些牛鬼蛇神继续霸占我国的领土。
    中国天主教友爱国会主席皮潄石在会上着重指出，美帝国主义不仅到处进行军事侵略，而且还进行文化侵略，例如利用宗教侵略我国台湾，到处进行间谍活动。他说，像台湾这样一个小小的地区，竟有七千二百多名传教士，其中大多数是美国人，这些美国传教士同美国特务组织有密切的联系。
    中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会常务委员赵紫宸和蒋翼振在发言中指出，艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行的悲惨遭遇，说明人民的力量是不可欺侮的。套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索正在抽紧。中国有一句俗话：“自作孽，不可活”，美帝国主义就是这样地在全世界到处作孽，它就活不久了。
    中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会委员王近溪说，美帝国主义不仅是中国人民的死敌，也是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。今天，我军万炮齐发给美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔以沉重的打击，将来美帝国主义还要遭到全世界人民亿万发大炮的轰击，遭到加倍的惩罚。
    中国佛教协会副会长噶喇藏在讲话中愤怒斥责了艾森豪威尔制造
  “两个中国”的阴谋，他指出，美帝国主义的这个阴谋，只能使台湾同胞和全世界人民对他的帝国主义本性看得更加清楚。艾森豪威尔在远东的遭遇，说明美帝国主义已经成了全世界一个最臭的东西。
    中国道教协会副会长孟明慧说，艾森豪威尔是这样一个“瘟神”，他不制造紧张局势就活不下去，他走到哪里，哪里的人民就要起来教训他。福建前线万炮齐发，说明艾森豪威尔远东之行的阴谋已在炮声中破产了。
    中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初说，福建前线部队的炮声长了全世界人民的志气，灭了帝国主义的威风。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生说，艾森豪威尔在亚洲和我国台湾的强盗旅行，是美帝国主义策划战争、制造亚洲紧张局势的一个新的阴谋，我们坚决反对。
    在会上讲话的还有中国天主教友爱国会副主席李德培，中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会常务委员阎迦勒，中国道教协会副秘书长黎遇航，中国佛教学院教授正果，中国天主教友爱国会连秋航，中国佛教协会理事高观如，天主教北京教区主教姚先裕等各教派的代表人士。
