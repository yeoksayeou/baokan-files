Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Washington: The world's public enemy, Eisenhower, who hurriedly returned to Washington, delivered a radio address to the nation on the 27th, attempting to whitewash his disgraceful Far East trip. He indicated that the United States was not reconciled to failure and would continue to cause trouble and disrupt peace in Asia and the world.

Eisenhower, after concluding his anxiety-ridden Far East trip, had "rested" in Honolulu for several days to calm his nerves.

In his speech, which provided a so-called "simple factual background" to his Far East trip, Eisenhower disregarded the "like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts 'kill it!'" treatment he received in the Far East and boasted that "many significant events occurred" during his trip, claiming that people expressed "warm friendship" to him and that the "relationship" between the United States and the people of the Far East had been "strengthened."

However, even Eisenhower, who is skilled at fabricating such tall tales, could not conceal the embarrassment of being turned away by the Japanese people. He admitted that "unpleasant events" had occurred in Japan in the past few weeks for the United States, and that his inability to visit Japan "was disappointing." In his speech, Eisenhower became enraged and went so far as to slander the Japanese people's patriotic and righteous struggle as merely "violent acts taken by a few rabid and disorderly people." Eisenhower absurdly claimed that the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle was "manufactured" by the Soviet Union and China and "not caused by the United States," and that the United States "must not mistakenly attribute what the communists have done to ourselves."

Eisenhower emphasized that the U.S. government's "basic policy" toward Japan would remain unchanged and that the "future of relations" between the United States and Japan was "good." He described the so-called "ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty as an "important victory for the free world." He emphasized the "necessity" of "more forcefully linking" Far Eastern countries "with the United States" for the sake of so-called "common interests." He clamored that the United States would use Japan as a tool to pursue its aggressive policies in the Far East, saying, "We are seeking and continuing to build and strengthen this connection with Japan and with other countries through various actions—my recent trip is just one example. Under the current circumstances, a Far East policy of 'waiting for things to calm down on their own' will not meet the needs of the free world."

In his speech, Eisenhower once again peddled his "sham peace" wares, saying that the United States "must continue to be steadfastly committed to a peace of freedom and justice," and that if the situation or circumstances made it feel necessary to make another trip, he "will not hesitate for a second" to make such a trip again. However, Eisenhower emphasized that the "first thing" the United States must do "is to keep our (America's) own defenses strong, modern, and prepared."

### 艾森豪威尔惊魂甫定又叫嚷坚持战争政策  美帝要继续利用日本扩张侵略

    艾森豪威尔惊魂甫定又叫嚷坚持战争政策
    美帝要继续利用日本扩张侵略
    据新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：匆匆忙忙返回华盛顿的世界人民公敌艾森豪威尔27日向全国发表了一篇广播演说，粉饰他的丢尽了丑的远东之行，并且表示美国不干心失败，而要继续捣乱，继续破坏亚洲和世界的和平。
    艾森豪威尔在结束了他的提心吊胆的远东之行以后，曾经在檀香山“休息”了好几天以稳定惊魂。
    在为他的远东之行提供所谓
  “一个简单的事实背景”的演说里，艾森豪威尔不顾他远东之行中“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的遭遇，而吹嘘在他远东之行期间“发生了许多意义重大的事件”，说什么人们对他表示了“热烈的友谊”，说什么美国同远东地区人民的“关系有了加强”。
    但是，即使善于编造这些弥天大谎的艾森豪威尔，也无法掩饰他被日本人民饷以闭门羹的窘态。他承认，过去几周在日本发生了对美国说来是“不愉快的事件”，他不能访问日本，“这是令人失望的”。艾森豪威尔在演说中恼羞成怒，竟然大肆诬蔑日本人民的爱国正义斗争只是“少数狂暴的、不守秩序的人采取了强暴的行为”，艾森豪威尔把日本人民的反美反岸斗争荒谬地说成是苏联和中国“制造的”，而“不是美国引起来的”，美国“决不能错误地把共产党人所做的事情归咎于自己”。
    艾森豪威尔强调，美国政府对日本的“基本政策”仍将不变，日美“关系的前途是良好的”。他把美日军事同盟条约的所谓“批准”，说成是什么“自由世界一个重要的胜利”。他强调为了所谓“共同利益”而把远东国家“同美国更有力地联接起来的必要性”。他叫嚷美国要利用日本作为在远东推行侵略政策的工具，他说，“我们正通过多种行动——我最近的旅行只是其中的一个例子——设法并继续建立和加强同日本以及同其他国家的这种联系。在目前情况下，一个‘等待事情自己平静下去’的远东政策将是不能满足自由世界的需要的。”
    艾森豪威尔在演说里再次兜售他“假和平”的货色，说什么美国“必须继续坚定不移地致力于自由和正义的和平”，只要局势或情况使他觉得有再作一次旅行的必要，他“将一秒钟也不犹豫地决定”再作一次这样的旅行。但是，艾森豪威尔强调，美国所要做的“首要的事情是使我们（美国）自己的防务保持强大、现代化和戒备”。
