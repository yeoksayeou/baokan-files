Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Telegram: Seoul News: Workers, farmers, and students in various parts of South Korea continue to widely launch struggles against fascist rule and for democratic and survival rights.

According to Seoul Radio Station broadcasts, on May 31, the employees of the Seoul area bus union began a general strike to demand an eight-hour work system and higher wages.

According to Daejeon Radio Station broadcasts, 600 male and female workers at the Daejeon Textile Factory held a sit-in demonstration on May 26, demanding higher wages. It is reported that the workers at this factory have to work like slaves for 18 hours a day, and the wages they receive are less than one-third of the local minimum living expenses. On May 30, fifty workers working at the Seosan Station in Chungcheongnam-do launched a resolute struggle to demand that the employer immediately pay the 1.5 million won in wages owed to the workers.

According to Busan Radio Station broadcasts, more than 200 workers dismissed by the "Joseon Textile Busan Factory" held a two-hour demonstration on May 23, demanding reinstatement. The placards held by the workers read "Immediately reinstate those illegally dismissed." They shouted slogans such as "The gangster capitalists confess their crimes!" The demonstrators dispersed after the employer agreed to negotiate with the workers. The workers said they would continue the struggle until their demands were met.

According to reports, more than 200 farmers near Cheongju City, Chungcheongbuk-do, recently held a demonstration demanding that the puppet authorities stop collecting excessive water taxes. The news said that most of the water conservancy facilities in this area were originally built by the farmers themselves. However, the puppet authorities' so-called "Cheongmi Water Conservancy Association" forcibly collects water taxes from farmers every year, equivalent to land rent. Enraged by this plundering behavior of the puppet authorities, the farmers rushed into the office of the "Cheongmi Water Conservancy Association" and carried out a demonstration struggle.

Students in various parts of South Korea continue to hold class boycotts and demonstrations to drive out the US-Lee agents and loyalists from schools. In some places, the students' struggle has achieved initial victories.

After a week of tenacious struggle, the students of the Busan branch of Yonsei University in Busan have driven out the principal who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group. According to Busan Radio Station broadcasts, the students of this school held a "condemnation meeting" on May 12 to expose the crimes of this loyalist principal, and then passed a resolution to begin a class boycott.

According to Daegu Radio Station broadcasts, on May 31, more than 500 students from Bonghwa Middle School in Bonghwa County, Gyeongsangbuk-do, held a sit-in demonstration, demanding that the principal and three teachers who served as US-Lee agents get out of the school. Students of Sangju Agricultural Sericulture High School in this province also held a demonstration demanding the expulsion of the loyalist principal.

According to Cheongju Radio Station broadcasts, all the students of Cheongju High School in Cheongju City held a "condemnation meeting" on May 23, driving out the principal and teachers who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group from the school.

In addition, more than 1,200 students from Youngshin High School in Daegu City held a class boycott on May 31 to protest the corruption of the principal, school supervisor, and chairman of the foundation. The students demanded that they return the fees illegally collected from the students.

According to Jinju Radio Station broadcasts, all the students of Shinhung High School in Jinju City began a class boycott on May 23, demanding that the authorities revise the education policy, give students freedom and democracy, and resolutely demanding that the four teachers who colluded with the puppet authorities get out of the school.

Xinhua News Agency Pyongyang, May 31st Telegram: Seoul News: The struggle of people from all walks of life in South Korea against fascist tyranny has become increasingly deeper after a month of development. Recently, under the influence of the increasingly high fighting spirit of the broad masses of the people, merchants and small and medium business owners in various parts of South Korea have also held demonstrations and collective market strikes to oppose the puppet government's heavy taxes.

According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, small merchants and small and medium business owners in Gwangju City jointly held a market strike today to oppose the puppet authorities' collection of excessive taxes. They demanded the immediate abolition of the "head tax" and demanded that other taxes they currently bear be reduced by at least one-third. They also distributed leaflets regarding the above requirements.

More than 500 merchants in Masan Port also held a demonstration on May 30. The placards they held read: "Replace the gangster tax officials!" "Abolish exorbitant taxes!" They also protested against the shameless behavior of the pseudo-education authorities in forcibly collecting double education taxes. According to Jeonju Radio Station broadcasts, more than 500 merchants in Jeonju City held a demonstration on May 27, shouting slogans demanding "lower taxes" and the establishment of sanitary facilities in the market.

In Masan, which first launched a large-scale struggle against the US-Lee group, more than 200 merchants held a demonstration on May 23 to protest against the puppet authorities' forced collection of exorbitant taxes. According to Busan Radio Station broadcasts, on this day, the merchants held up placards with the words "Gangster tax officials get out!" and passed in front of the Masan pseudo "Tax Office" to the Masan City pseudo "City Hall," shouting: "The gangster tax officials in the City Hall step down!" "Abolish excessive taxes!".
