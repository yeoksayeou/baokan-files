(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Some prominent Chinese scientists have issued statements enthusiastically responding to the appeal to peace-loving people worldwide adopted by the Korean Peace Defenders Congress held in Pyongyang on May 23.

This congress was held to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialists' launching of the war of aggression in Korea. The congress called on peace-loving people of all countries worldwide to resolutely denounce the crimes of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism in Korea.

Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the National Science and Technology Association, said that ten years ago, U.S. imperialism frantically launched the war of aggression against Korea, seriously undermining peace in Asia and the world. However, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, and with the sympathy and support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people worldwide, and with the direct assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people, after more than three years of arduous and tenacious struggle, finally brought about the shameful defeat of U.S. imperialism. Li Siguang said that the growing strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the most important pillar for the entire Korean people to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Korean people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Vice Chairman of the National Science and Technology Association, said that recently, U.S. imperialist chieftain Eisenhower, immediately after trampling on China's territory of Taiwan, personally went to the vicinity of the 38th parallel to cheer on his invading troops. This fully proves that the warmongering nature of U.S. imperialism will absolutely not change. To safeguard world peace, people worldwide must unite and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Pan Zinian, Deputy Director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressed his firm belief in his speech that the heroic Korean people will certainly drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea. He pointed out that the Chinese and Korean people are supporting each other with their anti-American struggles. The Korean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland is a powerful support for the Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and war provocations. The Chinese people also firmly support the Korean people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle, and firmly believe that the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will definitely be unified.

Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that "make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their final destruction," this is the law of imperialism and all reactionaries. The Chinese people will join hands with the Korean people, shoulder to shoulder, to resolutely struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression until the death of U.S. imperialism.

Chen Yuan, member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and President of Beijing Normal University, said that the Chinese people have always firmly supported the Korean people's just struggle. It is the Korean people who decide the fate of Korea, and absolutely not U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries. The Korean people will definitely be able to drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Liu Chongle, member of the Department of Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a biologist who participated in the opposition to the U.S. imperialists' bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, said that U.S. imperialist military aggression and economic exploitation of South Korea are the root cause of all the suffering of the South Korean people. In order to eliminate the root cause of the suffering of the South Korean people, and in order to not allow U.S. imperialism to continue to occupy the sacred territory of the Korean people, we must wage the most resolute and continuous struggle against imperialism. Today is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and our common struggle will inevitably achieve complete victory.

    我国科学界著名人士
    谴责美帝国主义破坏世界和平
    支持朝鲜人民的反美爱国斗争
    据新华社讯　我国一些著名科学家发表谈话，热烈响应5月23日在平壤举行的朝鲜保卫和平者代表大会通过的致全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书。
    这次代表大会是为了纪念美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争十周年而举行的。大会呼吁全世界各国爱好和平的人民坚决声讨美帝国主义在朝鲜犯下的侵略罪行。
    中国科学院副院长、全国科学技术协会主席李四光说，十年前，美帝国主义猖狂地发动了侵朝战争，严重地破坏了亚洲和世界和平。但是，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，在中国人民志愿军的直接援助下，经过三年多艰苦顽强的斗争，终于使美帝国主义遭到了可耻的失败。李四光说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的日益发展壮大，是全朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略、争取祖国和平统一的最主要的支柱，朝鲜人民的反美爱国正义斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    中国科学院副院长、全国科学技术协会副主席吴有训说，最近美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔紧接着践踏我国领土台湾之后，又亲自到三八线附近去为他的侵略军打气，这充分证明，美帝国主义的好战本性是绝对不会改变的。为了保卫世界和平，全世界人民必须团结起来和美帝国主义作坚决的斗争。
    中国科学院哲学社会科学部副主任潘梓年在谈话中表示深信英勇的朝鲜人民一定能把美帝国主义从南朝鲜赶出去。他指出，中国人民和朝鲜人民正在用自己的反美斗争互相支持。朝鲜人民为反对美帝国主义侵略和争取和平统一祖国而进行的正义斗争，是对中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和战争挑衅的正义斗争的有力支持，中国人民也坚决支持朝鲜人民的反美爱国正义斗争，并且坚信朝鲜人民的三千里江山定能统一。
    中国科学院技术科学部主任严济慈说，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直到最后灭亡，这是帝国主义和一切反动派的规律，中国人民将和朝鲜人民一起手携着手、肩并着肩地为反对美帝国主义的侵略而坚决斗争，直到美帝国主义死亡。
    中国科学院哲学社会科学部委员、北京师范大学校长陈垣说，中国人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争，决定朝鲜命运的是朝鲜人民，绝不是美帝国主义和反动派，朝鲜人民一定能够把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一。
    中国科学院生物学部委员、曾参加反对美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行的细菌战的生物学家刘崇乐说，美帝国主义对南朝鲜的军事侵略与经济压榨，是南朝鲜人民一切痛苦的根源。为了消除南朝鲜人民痛苦的根源，为了不容许美帝国主义继续霸占朝鲜人民的神圣领土，我们必须对帝国主义进行最坚决的与持续的斗争。今天是东风压倒西风的时代，我们的共同斗争必然会获得完全的胜利。
