    The Older, the Stronger; Continuously Revolutionizing
    Zhang Zigao, Professor of Tsinghua University

    I fully agree with Comrade Lin Feng's report. I am seventy-four years old this year and have been engaged in education for nearly half a century. Today, I have the opportunity to participate in such an unprecedentedly grand national gathering of heroes from the cultural and educational sectors as a representative of the people's teachers. I feel extremely excited and encouraged. Now, I would like to share a few of my insights:

    Always Follow the Communist Party
    From my life experience, I deeply understand that the Party's leadership is the guarantee of all victories. It was the Party that pointed out the correct direction for me, guided me onto the path of revolution, and gave me new life.

    I remember sixty years ago, when I was fourteen years old, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing and ravaged our motherland, causing me great indignation. From that time on, I developed the idea of "enriching the country and strengthening the people." In the decades that followed, I dreamed of "saving the country through science," "saving the country through education," "saving the country through industry," and "saving the country through agriculture." However, under the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang, all these dreams were shattered. By the eve of liberation, I had become disheartened and planned to retire. In 1949, with the liberation of the whole country, I saw that the Party and the government quickly stabilized social order, stabilized prices, developed production, and ushered in a new era. I also saw the spirit of the Party members and cadres serving the people wholeheartedly and their hardworking and simple style. I was fortunate that the Chinese people had such a good party and government. Later, the Party also helped me learn the guidelines and policies, making me understand that the Party truly represents the long-term and fundamental interests of the 650 million Chinese people, and that the Party is open and aboveboard, selfless, and never conceals its views. What moved me most was the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. The Party earnestly expects and helps every intellectual to transform themselves and catch up with the times. More importantly, through various political movements, such as the land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against America and aid to Korea, the Three-Anti Campaign, and ideological remolding, I realized that imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism were the three major enemies of the Chinese people. This also made me finally find the reasons why my past ideals could not be realized. Especially in the struggle against American aggression and aid to Korea, the Chinese people, who had just been liberated, under the leadership of the Party, actually defeated the world's number one and most vicious American imperialism. The Chinese people truly stood up! I sincerely felt that the Party is the savior of the motherland and the people.

    Since 1953, with the victory of the socialist revolution and the development of construction in the motherland, the teaching reform in schools has also made great achievements. Like the people of the whole country, I felt greatly encouraged. However, the bourgeois rightists were not reconciled to their defeat and launched a frenzied attack on the Party in 1957. The rightists at Tsinghua University also attacked the Party, completely negating the achievements of teaching reform since liberation and slandering the Party for not giving play to the role of intellectuals. I was very angry at their reversal of right and wrong and their betrayal of kindness. After the Party's education, I realized that this was not a personal grievance, nor a lack of understanding, but a life-and-death class struggle, and I had to participate in the battle to defend socialism. The struggle made me see the stubbornness and cunning of the rightists and the complexity of the class struggle, greatly improving my class consciousness.

    In 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line, an unprecedented Great Leap Forward situation appeared throughout the country, and a people's commune movement was launched in the countryside. This excellent situation greatly encouraged and educated me, making me see the bright prospects of communism. At this time, the Party put forward the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. I earnestly studied the educational theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and Chairman Mao's writings on education, making me understand that the fundamental task of the educational revolution is to finally eliminate the difference between mental and manual labor and cultivate well-rounded communist new people. In order to realize the most sublime ideal of mankind—to establish a communist society—I urgently requested to join the vanguard of the proletariat and contribute all my strength to this magnificent cause. In January 1959, I was honorably admitted into the Communist Party of China. Looking back on the past ten years, the Party has transformed me, an old intellectual who had become dispirited in the old society, into a vanguard fighter of the proletariat. I deeply realized the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy toward intellectuals. After more than sixty years of tortuous roads, I finally found my glorious destination, which made me even more convinced that only under the leadership of the Party, adhering to ideological remolding, studying Marxism-Leninism, participating in actual struggles, and closely integrating one's destiny with the cause of the Party is the only correct path for intellectuals.

    Rely on the Masses, Rely on New Forces
    After the reorganization of departments in 1952, in addition to me, only nine young teachers were left in the chemistry teaching and research group of Tsinghua University. Most of them were fresh graduates, but they had to offer chemistry courses to more than 1,200 students. At the same time, they had to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fundamentally reform teaching. The difficulty was great. At that time, some people advised me that it would be better to deal with it with the old teaching experience of more than 30 years. This seemed easy, but in fact, it was avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial and sticking to the old ways. I did not listen to him, but listened to the Party, and resolutely embarked on the new path. When the old teaching materials were no longer applicable, I studied the new Soviet teaching materials with the young people. Not knowing a single Russian word, I started learning from scratch with everyone. When young teachers lacked experience and were afraid to go on the platform, I helped them develop training plans, gave them teaching demonstrations, and listened to their trial lectures. Everyone was afraid of giving introductory lectures, so I studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" with everyone and volunteered to give trial lectures to everyone. In the end, the young people were more motivated and learned quickly. Difficulties were overcome one by one, and everyone went on the platform one by one. In this way, we not only offered brand-new general chemistry courses, and the teaching quality far exceeded the past, but also offered a complete set of basic chemistry courses required by the six departments of engineering physics, and the number of teachers also increased from ten to more than forty. From here, I began to understand the power of the masses.

    In 1958, according to the needs of socialist construction, the chemistry teaching and research group, which had just gained a firm foothold, took on the task of establishing the Department of Chemical Engineering, and first started new majors with weak domestic strength. I served as the head of the department.

    At the beginning of the establishment of the department, it can be said that it was poor and blank. Almost all the teachers did not understand chemical engineering. Many of the new young people had transferred from other fields and had only studied general chemistry in their freshman year. As for instruments and equipment, there were very few. It was indeed a "poor stick department." At that time, there were three question marks in front of us: Could we build a chemical engineering department? Should we carry out scientific research and production while preparing for new majors? Dare we tackle cutting-edge projects? Some comrades in the teaching and research group had doubts, and a bourgeois expert from another school also laughed at us: "The chemistry of the Tsinghua Chemistry Teaching and Research Group can only score two points, and it is impossible to run such a new major!" However, we were not intimidated by the difficulties. Taking advantage of the east wind of the Great Leap Forward, teaching, production, and scientific research were launched simultaneously, and a mass movement to build the department and tackle cutting-edge projects was carried out with the revolutionary spirit and methods of the "poor stick." In the battle to attack a certain cutting-edge scientific research project, a group of young teachers and first-year students dared to think and act. After twenty-six failures, they finally trial-produced a cutting-edge product in the laboratory. Immediately afterwards, in just over three months, they built an intermediate factory for producing this cutting-edge product. It was with this revolutionary drive that we prepared all the major major courses, established six teaching laboratories, carried out five scientific research projects, built four intermediate factories and four research laboratories, and produced more than ten products in just over a year. Our department was built at the high speed of the Great Leap Forward. The teaching, production, and scientific research base is also taking shape. The number of faculty, staff, and students has also greatly increased. The young people who were laymen in the past have now become the backbone of building the department who are capable in both writing and martial arts. From the opening of the Department of Chemistry of Old Tsinghua in 1923 to 1949, the number of faculty, staff, and students never exceeded 150, and the main courses offered were only a few chemistry theory courses that the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group had already offered. Scientific research was even less, and as for production, there was none at all. We used only a little over a year to comprehensively surpass the achievements of the Old Tsinghua Chemistry Department in more than 20 years in teaching, production, and scientific research. It was truly a Great Leap Forward where one year is better than twenty years.

    The enthusiasm of these young people deeply moved me. On the tenth anniversary of the National Day, I could not help but write a poem entitled "Song of Youth's Enthusiasm." Some of the lines are:
    In the past, I loved Du Linglao,　　bragging about the yellow calf.
    After thousands of years of earth-shaking changes,　　the spirit of youth is unprecedented.
    High mountains bow their heads and rivers make way,　　Heaven is shaken up again.
    The establishment of a new department is needed by the times,　　it has not been long for a week.
    Rooting and sprouting and flowering,　　will see it become a forest.

    The enthusiasm of the young people greatly encouraged me and infected me. In those days, I also fought with them. When they felt difficult with new technical problems, I always studied with them and tried to solve them. When someone hesitated in the face of difficulties, I encouraged them to show the spirit of mountain climbers climbing peaks and grow in battle. Seeing these young people grow rapidly and catch up with the older generation, I felt happy from the bottom of my heart. I feel that it is the responsibility of our older generation to fully cultivate young people. "Green comes from blue and is better than blue" is also the expectation of our older generation. Only by being with young people and throwing ourselves into the torrent of mass movements can our older generation progress faster and feel younger and more energetic.

    Use Marxism-Leninism to Command Business and Transform the Worldview
    Since the first teaching reform in 1952, the Party Committee of Tsinghua University has been calling for resolutely implementing dialectical materialism in teaching, commanding business with politics, and cultivating students' correct worldview. At that time, some people opposed it, saying: "No matter whether you use a materialist or idealist point of view to teach, chemistry is still chemistry after all, and you will never teach chemistry as biology." Some people also worried that philosophy is profound and unattainable and difficult to do. I firmly believe that the Party's policy is completely correct. In the past few years, the practice of the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group has also shown that dialectical materialism must be implemented in teaching, and it must be able to be implemented.

    I have taught for decades. Although I have some chemical business knowledge, I am a primary school student in the face of Marxism-Leninism theory. I made up my mind to learn respectfully and diligently, and I must learn it well. The vivid examples of workers and peasants learning philosophy to solve practical problems greatly encouraged us and dispelled everyone's mysticism about philosophy. In the past few years, I and the young comrades have often studied Chairman Mao's works by ourselves. And systematically listened to the philosophy courses offered by the school twice, taking notes carefully and participating in discussions. When the Soviet expert Babanov gave a demonstration lecture on physics, although it was not a chemistry course, I went to listen to every class and learned how he implemented the dialectical materialist viewpoint in the teaching process. At the same time, we also often organized special discussions on philosophical issues in chemistry within the teaching and research group, and tried to implement them in all teaching processes such as lectures, tutoring, and experiments. In this way, by learning and practicing, the level of philosophy has been continuously improved, and some achievements have also been made in implementing the dialectical materialist viewpoint in teaching.

    In the past, when teachers taught chemistry, they often listed various chemical phenomena in isolation, without contact with each other. Therefore, students felt that chemistry did not have a universal law and relied on rote memorization. Now, we use the dialectical materialist viewpoint to analyze materials. For example, when talking about the structure of matter, we explain the unity of various atoms and analyze that their inherent main contradiction is the tendency of electrons to gain and lose. When talking about various molecular bond crystals and various dispersed systems, we not only analyze the inherent unified connection between them, but also clearly point out their differences. In this way, students reflect that chemistry is not so chaotic and without laws, and their understanding of chemistry has been greatly deepened. This greatly helps them form a dialectical materialist worldview. After teachers study and implement dialectical materialism, they also feel that it has greatly deepened their understanding of the chemistry discipline and improved their ideological level.

    Marxism-Leninism has also brought new life to our scientific research. Before liberation, my research on the history of Chinese chemistry was mainly based on interest, and I could not get out of the simple collation and textual research of historical materials. In this way, the research work could only become a soulless body, or even a body with incomplete limbs. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, after studying Marxism-Leninism, especially after participating in the criticism of bourgeois idealist viewpoints in the field of chemistry, I realized that the history of chemistry is a science with strong ideology and a fighting weapon of Marxism-Leninism; I realized that studying the history of chemistry is to study the objective laws of the development process of chemistry and to conduct materialist historical view and patriotism education for the broad masses of the people. For example, regarding the origin and development of the ancient yin and yang five elements theory, I emphasized that it is the ancient simple materialism, which is summarized by the ancient working people through social practice and continuous deepening of their understanding of nature. Another example is to research, sort out, and improve the unique technologies of ancient Chinese working people in steelmaking, papermaking, and ceramics, which can play a role in current production and achieve the purpose of using the past for the present.

    In this way, relying closely on Mao Zedong Thought, I finally completed the first draft of "History of Chinese Chemistry" with a total of 150,000 words at the end of last year in less than two years with the care and encouragement of the Party and the help of young comrades. For me personally, the amount and quality of scientific research in the past year exceeded the total scientific research in the 30 years before liberation. The comparison between the past and the present makes me deeply realize that Marxism-Leninism must be resolutely implemented in all business fields of teaching and scientific research. Only in this way can academic research have the correct direction, can it better serve socialist construction, and can it truly make achievements.

    Comrades! There is a very powerful Chinese idiom called "The older, the stronger." I am willing to encourage each other with comrades with the spirit of continuous revolution, move forward together, implement the spirit of this conference, learn from the advanced experience of comrades, and strive for a greater leap forward in ideology and work.

    老当益壮　不断革命
    清华大学教授　张子高
    我完全同意林枫同志的报告。我今年七十四岁了，从事教育也将近半个世纪，今天能有机会作为人民教师的代表，来参加这样空前盛大的全国第一届文教界群英大会，真是感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞。现在谈谈我的几点体会：
    永远跟着共产党走
    从我的一生经历中深深体会到党的领导是一切胜利的保证。是党，给我指出了正确的方向，引导我走上了革命的道路，给了我新的生命。
    我记得还在六十年前，当我十四岁的时候，八国联军侵占北京，蹂躏我们的祖国，引起我极大的愤慨。从那时起就产生了“富国强民”的思想。以后几十年间，我曾经梦想过“科学救国”、“教育救国”、“工业救国”、“农业救国”等念头。但是在清朝、北洋军阀和国民党的反动统治下，这些梦想全都破灭了。到解放前夕，我已经心灰意懒，准备退休养老了。1949年全国解放，我看到党和政府很快就安定了社会秩序，稳定了物价，发展了生产，出现了一片开国的新景象。我还看到党员干部全心全意为人民服务的精神，艰苦朴素的作风。我为中国人民能有这样好的政党和政府而庆幸。以后，党又帮助我学习了方针政策，使我知道了党确实是代表着六亿五千万中国人民的最长远、最根本的利益，党是光明磊落，大公无私的，从不隐蔽自己的观点。最使我感动的是党对知识分子的团结、教育、改造的政策，党殷切地期望和帮助每个知识分子改造自己，赶上时代。更重要的是通过历次政治运动，如土改、镇反、抗美援朝、三反、思想改造等，使我认清了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义是中国人民的三大敌人，也使我终于找到了过去的理想不能实现的原因。特别是在抗美援朝的斗争中，刚刚获得解放的中国人民在党的领导下，居然战胜了世界第一号最凶恶的美帝国主义，中国人民真正站起来了！我衷心感到党是祖国人民的救星。
    1953年以来，随着祖国社会主义革命的胜利，建设的发展，学校的教学改革也取得很大的成绩。我和全国人民一样感到很大的鼓舞。但是资产阶级右派却不甘心失败，在1957年向党发动了猖狂的进攻。清华大学的右派分子也向党大肆攻击，一笔抹杀解放以来教学改革的成绩，诬蔑党不发挥知识分子的作用。我对于他们这样颠倒黑白，恩将仇报，感到十分气愤。经过党的教育，我才认识到这不是个人恩怨，也不是认识不清，而是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，为了捍卫社会主义必须参加战斗。从斗争中使我看到右派分子的顽强狡猾，以及阶级斗争的复杂性，大大提高了我的阶级觉悟。
    1958年，在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国出现了史无前例的大跃进的形势，农村里兴起了人民公社化的运动。这种大好形势极大地鼓舞教育了我，使我看到了共产主义光辉的前景。这时党提出了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。我认真地学习了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的教育理论和毛主席关于教育工作的论著，使我明白了教育革命的根本任务就是最后消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差异，培养全面发展的共产主义新人。为了实现人类最崇高的理想——建立共产主义社会，我迫切要求参加无产阶级的先锋队，把自己全部力量贡献给这个壮丽的事业。1959年1月我光荣地被吸收为中国共产党的党员。回顾过去这十年，党使我这个在旧社会中已经意志消沉的旧知识分子转变成为无产阶级的先锋战士，我深深体会到党对知识分子政策的正确和伟大。经过六十多年曲折的道路，我终于找到了自己光荣的归宿，这使我更加确信只有在党的领导下，坚持思想改造，学习马克思列宁主义，参加实际斗争，把自己的命运和党的事业紧密地结合在一起，才是知识分子唯一正确的道路。
    依靠群众，依靠新生力量
    1952年院系调整后，清华大学化学教研组除我以外，只留下九个年轻教师，大都是刚毕业的新手，却要开出一千二百多人的化学课。同时要学习苏联先进经验，从根本上改革教学。困难是很大的。当时有人劝我不如先用三十多年来老一套的教书经验对付对付再说。这看来是驾轻就熟，其实是避重就轻，因循守旧。我没有听他的话，而是听党的话，坚决上马。老教材不适用了，我就和年轻人一起学习苏联新教材。俄文一字不识，我就和大家一起从头学起。青年教师没经验不敢上讲台，我就帮他们订进修计划，给他们作讲课示范，听他们试讲。大家怕讲绪论课，我就和大家一起学毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”，自告奋勇给大家试讲。到底还是年轻人干劲大，学得快，困难一个个被克服，大家一个个登上讲台。就这样，我们不但开出了全新的普通化学课，教学质量远超过去，而且开出了六门工程物理系所需的全套化学基础课，教师也由十人发展到四十多人。从这里我开始体会到了群众的力量。
    1958年，根据社会主义建设的需要，刚刚站稳脚跟的化学教研组又担负起建立工程化学系的任务，而且首先办起国内力量较薄弱的新专业。我担任了系主任。
    建系伊始，可说是一穷二白。几乎所有教师都不懂化工。新来的年轻人，不少还是转行来的，只念过大一的普通化学。至于仪器设备更是寥寥无几。确实是个“穷棒子系”。当时有三个问号摆在我们面前：能不能建成化工系？要不要在筹备新专业的同时就开展科学研究和生产？敢不敢攻尖端项目？教研组里有的同志心存疑虑，外校一位资产阶级专家也嘲笑我们：“清华化学教研组的化学只能考两分，根本办不了这种新专业！”但是，我们没有被困难吓倒。乘大跃进的东风，教学、生产和科学研究同时上马，用穷棒子的革命精神和革命办法大搞建系和攻尖端的群众运动。在猛攻某项尖端科学研究项目的战斗中，一批年轻教师和一年级同学敢想敢干，经过二十六次失败，终于在实验室里试制出尖端产品。紧接着，仅仅用了三个多月的时间，又建成了生产这项尖端产品的中间工厂。就是以这种革命干劲，仅仅一年多时间，我们就已准备好了全部主要专业课，建立了六个教学实验室，进行了五项科学研究，建成了四个中间工厂及四个研究实验室，生产出了十几种产品。我们的系以大跃进的高速度建成了。教学、生产、科学研究三联基地也正在形成。师生员工数量也有了大发展。过去是外行的年轻人，今天也都成了能文能武的建系骨干。老清华的化学系从1923年开办到1949年，师生员工人数从来没有超过一百五十人，开出的主要课程不过是化学教研组早已开出的几门化学理论课，科学研究更是少得可怜，至于生产则根本没有。我们仅用了一年多的时间就在教学、生产、科学研究各方面全面的超过了老清华化学系二十多年的成就，真是一年胜似二十年的大跃进。
    青年人这种劲头使我深受感动。在国庆十周年的时候，我情不自禁地提笔赋诗一首，名曰：“青年干劲之歌”。其中有几句是：
    昔日尝爱杜陵叟　　黄犊来个夸人口
    地复天翻千载后　　青年意气古无偶
    高山低头河让路　　天公为之重抖擞
    建置新系应时需　　寒暑一周未之久
    生根茁芽复放花　　行看蔚然成林薮
    青年人的干劲大大鼓舞了我，感染了我，那些时候，我也和他们一起战斗。当他们对新的技术问题感到有困难，我总是和他们一起研究，设法解决。当有人在困难面前有点犹豫时，我就鼓励他们拿出登山队员攀高峰的精神，在战斗中成长。看到这些年轻人迅速成长赶到老一辈的前面，我就从心里感到高兴。我觉得全力培养青年正是我们老一辈人的责任。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，也正是我们老一辈人的期望。要和青年人在一起，投身到群众运动的洪流中，我们老一辈人也才会进步更快，也才感到越活越年轻，愈干愈有劲。
    用马克思列宁主义统帅业务改造世界观
    清华大学党委从1952年第一次教学改革起，就一直号召教学中要坚决贯彻辩证唯物主义，以政治统帅业务，培养同学正确的世界观。当时有人反对说：“不论用唯物观点还是唯心观点讲课，化学毕竟还是化学，总不会把化学讲成生物学。”也有人顾虑哲学深奥，高不可攀，很难作到。我则坚信党的方针是完全正确的。几年来，化学教研组的实践也说明了辩证唯物主义在教学中必须贯彻，而且也一定能够贯彻。
    我教了几十年书，虽然有了一些化学业务知识，但在马克思列宁主义理论面前却是一个小学生。我下定决心，要恭恭敬敬地学，勤勤恳恳地学，非学好不可。工农群众学习哲学解决实际问题的生动事例给我们很大的鼓舞，破除了大家对哲学的神秘论。这几年来，我和青年同志一起，经常自学毛主席著作。并前后系统地听了两次学校开出的哲学课，认真记笔记，参加讨论。当苏联专家巴巴诺夫作物理学示范讲课时，虽然不是讲化学课，但我每堂课都去听，学习他在教学过程中如何贯彻辩证唯物主义观点。同时，我们在教研组内还经常组织有关化学中哲学问题的专题讨论，并在讲课、辅导、实验等全部教学过程中力图加以贯彻。就这样，边学习、边实践，哲学水平得到了不断提高，在教学中贯彻辩证唯物主义观点也取得一些成绩。
    过去，教师们在讲化学课时，往往是孤立地罗列各个化学现象，互不联系，因此学生们感到化学没有普遍的规律，要靠死记。现在，用辩证唯物主义观点来分析材料。譬如讲到物质结构时就说明各种原子的统一性，并分析它们内在的主要矛盾就是电子得失的趋势。讲各种分子键晶体和各种分散系时，既分析了它们之间的内在统一的联系，同时又明确指出了它们的差别。这样，学生们反映，化学并不是那么杂乱无章，没有规律，对化学的理解大大加深了。这就大大有助于他们辩证唯物主义世界观的形成。教师们在学习和贯彻辩证唯物主义以后，也感到大大加深了对化学学科的理解，并且提高了思想水平。
    马克思列宁主义给我们科学研究也带来了新的生命力。解放前我研究中国化学史，主要是从兴趣出发，还不能脱出单纯的史料整理和考据，这样研究工作只能成为没有灵魂的躯壳，甚至是四肢不全的躯壳。近几年来，在党的领导下，学习了马克思列宁主义，尤其是参加了对化学领域中资产阶级唯心主义观点的批判后，我认识到化学史是一门思想性很强的科学，是一个马克思列宁主义的战斗武器；体会到研究化学史就是要研究化学发展过程的客观规律，向广大人民进行唯物史观和爱国主义教育。譬如关于古代阴阳五行理论的起源和发展，我就强调了它是古代朴素的唯物论，是古代劳动人民通过社会实践对自然界认识不断加深而概括出来的。又如研究、整理、提高我国古代劳动人民炼钢、造纸、陶瓷等方面的独特技术，就可以对现在生产发挥作用，达到古为今用的目的。
    就这样紧紧依靠毛泽东思想，终于用不到二年的时间，在党的关怀、鼓励和青年同志的帮助下，去年年底完成了“中国化学史”初稿，共十五万字。就我个人而言，去年一年的科学研究无论数量和质量都超过了解放前三十年科学研究的总和。今昔对比，使我深刻体会到在教学、科学研究一切业务领域中必须坚决贯彻马克思列宁主义。只有这样才能使学术研究有正确的方向，才能更好地为社会主义建设服务，才能切切实实做出成绩。
    同志们！中国有句很有力量的成语，叫做“老当益壮”。我愿以不断革命精神与同志们互相勉励，共同前进，贯彻这次大会的精神，学习同志们的先进经验，争取思想和工作的更大跃进。
