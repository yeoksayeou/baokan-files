Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Nanyang region in Henan Province is vigorously developing agricultural scientific research and cultivating agricultural technical talents. In the past year, they have cultivated more than 297,000 intermediate and primary agricultural technical talents through professional schools, agricultural middle schools, amateur technical night schools, and methods such as sending out, inviting in, and mentoring; through short-term training, mutual visits, exchange of experience, and holding on-site meetings, they have trained more than 175,000 technical talents who can master more than two agricultural technical skills. The region has also produced 3,744 "native experts," 77 of whom have been hired as special researchers by scientific research institutions at or above the regional level.

This new scientific and technological force is distributed in all aspects of the agricultural front, combining with the production center of each period to conduct various researches and technical guidance, which has promoted the development of agricultural production and the transformation of agricultural technology.

The work of Nanyang region in cultivating technical talents is closely linked to the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Under the guidance of the principle of combining professional institutional research with large-scale mass movements, the region carried out agricultural scientific research. In the past year, agricultural scientific research institutions and peasant technicians at all levels in the region completed a total of 2,451 research projects, and organized 64 professional research activities in the first quarter alone. According to the growth of crops and the problems found, they put forward more than 840 technical suggestions and compiled 474 kinds of technical reference materials. In the water conservancy construction work, scientific research work, according to the construction requirements at the time, successively improved and created more than 100 kinds and more than 50,000 pieces of advanced tools, which greatly improved the efficiency of river excavation in the region. In wheat management, scientific and technical personnel absorbed foreign experience and successfully manufactured indigenous pesticides and indigenous fertilizers for treating rust and preventing lodging using local methods.

The Party committees at all levels in Nanyang Prefecture attach great importance to agricultural scientific research. The Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county committees of various counties have established leading groups for scientific and technological research with the secretaries taking the lead. Prefectures and counties have established agricultural science research institutes and agricultural middle schools, and communes have also established agricultural science research stations.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 29th: Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, is actively expanding the ranks of industrial and agricultural technology, and the county has successively trained more than 15,000 industrial and agricultural technical talents.

Most of these industrial and agricultural technical talents have emerged from production movements. Among them, 104 are experts from worker and peasant backgrounds, and 9 of them have been hired as special researchers by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences. They all have certain inventions. For example, the improved wheat varieties cultivated by peasant seed expert Zhang Jieji, a special researcher at the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, have been promoted throughout the province. Wu Guangxia, a young peasant technician from the Hongyan Production Team of the Suxi Commune, mastered the rules of pest occurrence and pest control techniques, and created the county's first insect-free production team. Wu Xiaoying, the deputy director of the pig farm in Pudong Commune, has created and accumulated 35 kinds of local methods for treating pig diseases through long-term practice, and can make sows have multiple births and high yields. Lou Yuantu, a carpenter from the county's agricultural implement research institute, created 27 kinds of new tools such as wooden water turbines and power threshing machines, which strongly supported agricultural production.

    南阳  义乌培养技术人材支援农业生产
    新华社郑州29日电　河南省南阳地区大力开展农业科学研究工作，培养农业技术人材。一年来，他们通过专业学校、农业中学、业余技术夜校，和派出去、请进来、以师带徒等办法，已经培养出中级和初级的农业技术人材二十九万七千多人；通过短期训练、互相参观、交流经验、开现场会等方法，已经培养出能掌握两种以上农业技术知识的技术人材十七万五千多人。全区还出现了三千七百四十四名土专家，其中的七十七人已被专区级以上的科学研究机关聘请为特约研究员。
    这批新的科学技术队伍，分布在农业战线的各个方面，结合各个时期的生产中心，进行着各种研究和技术指导，对农业生产的发展和农业技术改造起了促进作用。
    南阳地区培养技术人材的工作，是紧密结合农业“八字宪法”进行的。在专业机构研究和大搞群众运动相结合的方针指导下，全区开展了农业科学研究工作。在去年一年内，全区各级农业科学研究机构和农民技术员，共完成二千四百五十一个研究项目，仅第一季度就组织各种专业研究活动六十四次。他们根据农作物生长情况和发现的问题，提出技术性建议八百四十多条，编印各种技术参考资料四百七十四种。在水利建设工作中，科学研究工作根据当时施工要求，先后改良和创造了一百多种、五万多件先进工具，使全区挖河工效大大提高。在小麦管理当中，科学技术员又吸收外地经验，用土法制造成功了治锈病和防止倒伏的土农药、土化肥。
    南阳专区各级党委对农业科学研究工作非常重视。中共南阳地委和各县县委都以书记挂帅，成立了科学技术研究工作领导小组。专区、县都建立了农业科学研究所，举办农业中学，各公社也建立了农业科学研究站。
    据新华社杭州29日电　浙江省义乌县积极壮大工农技术队伍，全县已先后培养出一万五千多名工农技术人材。
    这批工农技术人材，大都是从生产运动中涌现出来的。他们中有一百零四名是工农出身的专家，其中的九人已被浙江省农业科学院聘为特约研究员。他们都有一定的创造发明。如农民种子专家、浙江农业科学院特约研究员张介吉培育的小麦良种，已在全省各地推广。苏溪公社红焰生产队青年农民技术员吴光夏掌握害虫发生规律和治虫技术，创造了全县第一个无虫生产队。浦东公社养猪场副场长吴小英经过长期实践，仅在治疗猪病方面就创造和积累了三十五种土办法，并能使母猪多胎多产。县农具研究所木工楼元土创制了木制水轮机、动力打稻机等新式工具二十七种，有力地支援了农业生产。（附图片）
