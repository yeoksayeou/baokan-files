Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 22nd: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand rally this afternoon, warmly welcoming the Japanese Literary Delegation headed by Noma Hiroshi, and resolutely supporting the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke traitorous clique.

The rally was held at the Friendship Cinema. Large banners hung around the venue, reading: "Salute to the Heroically Struggling Japanese People!" "Resolutely Support the Japanese People's Anti-U.S. Patriotic and Just Struggle!" "Drive U.S. Imperialism Back Home!"

At 2:30 p.m., Ba Jin, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, announced the opening of the rally. Zhang Chunqiao, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, first spoke at the meeting. He expressed a warm welcome to the representatives of the heroic Japanese people who came to Shanghai from the front lines of the struggle against U.S. imperialism, at a time when our people are holding a large-scale "Propaganda Week Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace." He expressed admiration for the great victories achieved by the Japanese people in their anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. He said that the Japanese people's great struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, together with the anti-U.S. struggle waves of the South Korean people, the Turkish people, and the people of the whole world, has placed the U.S. imperialist aggressive front in the Far East in danger of complete collapse. The heroic struggle of the Japanese people overturned Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. Now the "plague god" Eisenhower, amidst the Far Eastern people's high-spirited slogans of "Yankee Go Home" and the "welcoming" artillery bombardments of the People's Liberation Army's Fujian front line troops, has scurried back to his old home. This is a shameful defeat for U.S. imperialism and a great victory for the people of the Far East and the world. The Japanese people have made important contributions in this struggle.

Zhang Chunqiao said: The Japanese people have solemnly declared with strong actions that the Japanese people will never approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that betrays the interests of the Japanese nation and endangers peace in Asia and the world, and therefore this treaty is completely invalid. The heroic Japanese people will surely continue their struggle with renewed vigor, and the Japanese people's struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Zhang Chunqiao said: The overall situation is now very good. U.S. imperialism is already surrounded by the people of the world. As long as we continue to strengthen unity, strengthen the struggle, and form a united front of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism, we will certainly be able to drive U.S. imperialism from our Taiwan, from Japan, from the Philippines, from South Korea, from Asia, and from all parts of the world back to its old home.

Li Wanxia, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Student Federation, expressed boundless anger in her speech at the heinous crime of the Kishida Nobusuke reactionary group in murdering the Japanese patriotic student Michiko Kamba. She said that the blood of the martyr will not be shed in vain. The bloody massacre by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries has aroused an even more fierce anti-U.S. storm of struggle among the Japanese people. The days of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs acting against the tide will not last long.

Head of the delegation, Noma Hiroshi, spoke amidst warm applause. He first expressed his gratitude to the literary and art circles and people from all walks of life in Shanghai for holding a grand welcome meeting for the Japanese literary delegation.

In his speech, Noma Hiroshi detailed the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He said that the blood shed by the Japanese people in the fierce battle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty will never be shed in vain. Their cause will never be interrupted. Nothing can stop the advancing strength of the Japanese people. He said: Today, Japanese workers are holding their fourth general strike to continue the struggle to overthrow Kishida Nobusuke and oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The scale of this strike will exceed the scale of the "June 4th" and "June 15th" general strikes. The struggle is becoming more and more intense and rising higher and higher. The struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and establish a democratic and independent regime in Japan will move further forward.

Noma Hiroshi said: The Japanese literary delegation is very honored to have the opportunity to participate in the "Propaganda Week Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace" activities in Shanghai. He said: Through our visit to China, we have clearly realized that the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people is heartfelt, and the Chinese people have a fighting friendship with the Japanese people. We will definitely bring this friendship back to Japan and convey it to the Japanese people. He expressed his belief that the close unity between the Japanese and Chinese people and their resolute opposition to the common enemies, U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism, will surely achieve victory. Noma Hiroshi finally shouted: "Long live the close unity between the Japanese and Chinese people, and victory in the struggle against imperialism!"

Kamei Katsuichiro, a member of the Japanese literary delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He said: It is unprecedented in the history of the two countries that the Japanese and Chinese people can form a united front against U.S. imperialism. This also means that a new dawn has appeared in Japanese history. After severely condemning the cultural aggression carried out by U.S. imperialism against Japan, he said: The decadent and corrupt lifestyle of the United States is poisoning the minds of the Japanese people. If we do not fight against American cultural aggression, the Japanese people cannot completely defeat U.S. imperialism. He also said that the U.S.-Japan military alliance, which was single-handedly created by U.S. imperialism, contains the most vicious conspiracy, which is to use Asians to fight Asians. This conspiracy of U.S. imperialism will never succeed.

Their speeches repeatedly aroused warm applause.

This rally was jointly organized by the Shanghai Branch

    上海各界一千多人集会
    盛大欢迎日本文学家代表团
    野间宏说没有任何东西能阻止日本人民前进
    据新华社上海22日电　上海各界人民一千多人今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，坚决支持日本人民反对美帝国主义和岸信介卖国集团的爱国正义斗争。
    大会在友谊电影院举行。会场四周悬挂的大幅标语上写着：“向英勇斗争的日本人民致敬！”“坚决支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争！”“把美帝国主义赶回老家去！”
    下午二时半，中国作家协会上海分会主席巴金宣布大会开始后，中国人民对外文化协会上海市分会会长张春桥首先在会上讲话。他对正当我国人民举行声势浩大的“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的时候，从反对美帝国主义斗争前线光临上海的英勇的日本人民的代表表示热烈的欢迎；对日本人民在反美爱国正义斗争中取得的巨大胜利表示敬佩。他说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的伟大斗争，同南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民、全世界人民反美斗争的浪潮汇集在一起，使美帝国主义在远东的侵略阵线面临着整个崩溃的危险。日本人民的英勇斗争，推翻了艾森豪威尔的“访”日计划。现在“瘟神”艾森豪威尔已经在远东人民高昂的“美国佬滚回去”的口号声中，在中国人民解放军福建前线部队的“迎送”大炮轰击声中，慌慌张张地滚回老家去了。这是美帝国主义一次可耻的失败，是远东人民和世界人民的一次大胜利。日本人民在这个斗争中作出了重要的贡献。
    张春桥说：日本人民已经用强有力的行动庄严宣告，日本人民永远不会批准出卖日本民族利益、危害亚洲和世界和平的日美军事同盟条约，因而这个条约是完全无效的。英勇的日本人民必将再接再厉地不断斗争下去，日本人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    张春桥说：现在整个形势很好。美帝国主义已经处在全世界人民的包围之中。只要我们继续加强团结，加强斗争，结成各国人民反对美帝国主义的统一战线，我们一定能够把美帝国主义从我国的台湾，从日本、从菲律宾、从南朝鲜，从亚洲和世界各地赶回它的老家去。
    上海市学生联合会副主席李皖霞在讲话中对于岸信介反动集团杀害日本爱国学生桦美智子的滔天罪行感到无比的愤怒。她说，烈士的鲜血是不会白流的。美日反动派的血腥屠杀已经激起了日本人民更加激烈的反美斗争风暴，美帝国主义及其走狗倒行逆施的日子不会长久了。
    野间宏团长在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先对上海文艺界和各界人民为日本文学家代表团举行盛大欢迎会表示感谢。
    野间宏在讲话中详细地介绍了日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争情况。他说，日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的激战中所流的鲜血，是决不会白流的。他们的事业决不会中断。对于日本人民的前进的力量，是任何东西都阻止不了的。他说：今天，日本工人举行第四次总罢工，继续进行打倒岸信介、反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，这次的规模将超过“六·四”、“六·一五”总罢工的规模。斗争越来越激烈，越来越高涨。为粉碎日美军事同盟条约、建立日本的民主、独立的政权的斗争，将进一步前进。
    野间宏说：日本文学家代表团很荣幸地得到了参加上海市的“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”活动的机会。他说：我们通过在中国的访问，明确地认识到，中国人民对日本人民的支持是由衷的，中国人民对日本人民有着战斗的友谊，我们一定把这种友谊带回日本去，转达给日本人民。他表示相信，日中两国人民紧密团结，坚决反对共同敌人美帝国主义和日本军国主义的斗争，必定能够取得胜利。野间宏最后高呼：“日中两国人民紧密团结，反对帝国主义的斗争胜利万岁！”
    日本文学家代表团团员龟井胜一郎也在会上讲了话。他说：日中两国人民能够结成反对美帝国主义的统一战线，这在两国历史上是空前的。这也意味着在日本历史上出现了新的黎明。他在严厉地谴责了美帝国主义对日本进行的文化侵略后说：美国堕落腐化的生活方式正在毒害着日本人民的心灵，如果不跟美国文化侵略进行斗争，日本人民就不能彻底战胜美帝国主义。他还说，美帝国主义一手制造的日美军事同盟包含着最毒辣的阴谋，那就是用亚洲人来打亚洲人。美帝国主义的这种阴谋绝对不会得逞。
    他们的讲话都一再激起了热烈的掌声。
    这个大会是由中国人民对外文化协会上海市分会、上海市文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会上海分会和上海市学生联合会联合举办的。
    出席大会的还有，对外文协上海市分会副会长苏步青、上海市文学艺术界联合会副主席贺绿汀、上海市妇联副主任沈粹缜、中国亚非团结委员会在上海委员张瑞芳，以及上海文艺界著名人士叶以群、孔罗荪、胡万春等。
    日本和平人士西园寺公一也应邀出席了大会。
    会后放映了纪录影片“上海人民支持日本人民的正义斗争”和彩色故事片“海鹰”。
