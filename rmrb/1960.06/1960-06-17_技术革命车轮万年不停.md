    The Wheel of Technological Revolution Turns Ceaselessly for Ten Thousand Years
    Wang Linhe
    My comrade-in-arms, Xie Wen, is bold in thought and action. Recently, he boldly "operated" on the high-voltage bridge I had successfully trial-produced, achieving a situation where one unit of material performs the work of twelve, one unit of labor performs the work of eight, and one unit of product serves multiple purposes. This further achieved the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. In this way, it has created extremely favorable conditions for the continued high-speed leap forward in our factory's production. I am excited and proud of Comrade Xie Wen's outstanding achievements and extend my warm congratulations to him. From this, I have once again realized that the technological revolution is truly a wheel that never stops turning, revolving every day and every moment. Each time it turns, it raises our scientific and technological level by a step; each time it turns, it propels our national construction endeavor forward by a step.
    Perhaps some people will say: "Wang Linhe only recently conquered this high-precision product, why is it being reformed again?" In fact, this is not strange at all. The Party has repeatedly taught us: The technological revolution has no end, and more, faster, better, and more economical results have no bottom line. My successful trial production of the high-voltage bridge is merely taking a step forward on the road to scaling peaks; it does not mean that I have reached the summit and cannot move forward anymore. The road of science and technology is wide and long, with no end; any achievement is only a new starting point, never the end point. Going from nothing to something, filling a gap in the motherland's instrument industry, is certainly a victory, but we cannot be satisfied with simply "having"; once we have it, we must strive for "better," constantly striving for perfection. There are no solidified, unchanging, perfect products in the world, and the high-voltage bridge is no exception. When this type of bridge was first successfully trial-produced, its shortcomings were not immediately apparent, but with production practice, its shortcomings were exposed: large volume, high material consumption, and long working hours, unable to keep up with the needs of the Great Leap Forward. This requires us to continuously revolutionize and constantly improve the bridge. Therefore, after I successfully trialed it, I worked with comrades to make an improvement, and the volume was reduced, but it was still far from enough. This time, Comrade Xie Wen broke the superstition of attacking cutting-edge technology, and with the help of the collective, bravely took on the task of product revolution, excellently completing the major "surgery" task. In a short period of time, he not only caught up with me but also surpassed me. This is a very exciting thing. Comrade Xie Wen's spirit of continuous revolution and his bold thinking and action style are worthy of our study.
    Our country's instrument industry is still very young, and many peaks need to be climbed and many gaps need to be filled. I want to work with Comrade Xie Wen and others to better arm ourselves with the thought of continuous revolution, cross one peak and then another, so that the motherland's industry can ride on the wheel of technological revolution and fly forward tirelessly!

    技术革命车轮万年不停
    王林鹤
    我的战友谢文同志，敢想敢做，最近把我试制成功的高压电桥大“开刀”，做到了材料一顶十二，人工一顶八，产品用途一顶几，更加达到了多快好省的要求。这样，就为我厂生产的继续高速度跃进，创造了十分有利的条件。我为谢文同志的出色成就感到兴奋和自豪，并向他表示热烈的祝贺。从这里我又一次体会到，技术革命真是个万年不停的车轮，它天天在转，时时在转。每转动一次，就把我们的科学技术水平提高一步；每转动一次，就把我们国家的建设事业推进一步。
    也许有人会说：“这个高精产品王林鹤攻下还不久，怎么又要改革了呢？”其实，这一点也不奇怪。党一再教导我们：技术革命无止境，多快好省没有底。我试制成高压电桥，不过是在攀高峰的道路上先走了一步，绝不是说我已经到达顶峰，不能再前进了。科学技术的道路又宽又长，永无尽头；任何一个成就，都只是新的起点，决不是终点。从无到有，填上祖国仪表工业的一个空白，这当然是一个胜利，但我们不能满足于“有”，有了还要“好”，还要精益求精。世界上没有凝固不变十全十美的产品，高压电桥也不能例外。这种电桥刚试制成功的时候，一下子还看不出缺点，随着生产实践，它的缺点就暴露出来了：体积大，耗料多，工时多，跟不上大跃进的需要。这就要求我们不断革命，使电桥不断完善。因此，我试成以后，曾和同志们一起作过一次改进，体积是缩小了，但还很不够。这次谢文同志破除了对攻尖端的迷信，在集体的帮助下勇敢地挑起了产品革命的担子，出色地完成了大“开刀”任务。在不长的时间里，他不但赶上了我，而且跑到我前面去了。这是十分令人兴奋的事情。谢文同志这种不断革命精神和敢想敢做的风格，值得我们学习。
    我国的仪表工业还很年轻，许多高峰要我们去攀登，许多空白要我们去填补。我要和谢文同志等一起，更好地用不断革命思想武装自己，跨过一峰，再跨一峰，让祖国的工业驾在技术革命的车轮上，永不停息地向前飞奔！
