    Do a Good Job of Selecting and Retaining Seeds
    The summer harvest has generally begun. Combining the summer harvest with doing a good job of selecting and retaining seeds, preparing enough high-quality varieties for next year's bumper summer harvest, is a very important task. Rural people's communes in all areas should do this job well. Since last winter, when various summer harvest crops were sown, many people's communes have planned and established seed fields. This is a favorable condition for selecting good seeds and retaining sufficient seeds this year. Selecting seeds every year leads to a continuous increase in production. This is the summary of the long-term experience of the masses. Launching a mass movement for selecting and retaining seeds is of great significance for ensuring the sustained leap forward in agricultural production and realizing a bumper agricultural harvest next year.
    Due to the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, the demand for high-quality varieties is increasing year by year, and the quality requirements are getting higher and higher. Especially after changes in farming conditions, the good varieties used today may not be able to meet the new needs tomorrow. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly select the best from the good, and the superior from the superior, to select and breed new superior varieties, and to multiply and promote them in a timely manner; during the promotion process, continue to select and breed even more superior varieties. In recent years, various regions have selected and bred a number of relatively good new varieties, such as Fujian's high-yielding early-maturing white wheat, and Guizhou and Shandong's early-maturing and high-yielding rapeseed. These varieties not only adapt to local natural conditions, but also increase production significantly. All such varieties this year should be selected and retained in a planned way, without eating a single grain or mixing a single seed, and all should be retained for seed. This is of great significance for striving for even greater harvests in the future.

    做好选种留种工作
    夏收已经普遍开始了。结合夏收作好选种留种工作，为明年夏季大丰收准备下足够的优良品种，是一件很重要的事情，各地农村人民公社应该把这个工作作好。去冬以来，在各种夏收作物播种的时候，很多人民公社便有计划地建立了种子田，这是今年选好种子、留足种子的有利条件。种子年年选，产量节节高，这是群众长期经验的总结。开展群众性的选种留种运动，对保证农业生产的持续跃进和实现明年农业大丰收具有重要意义。
    由于农业生产持续跃进，需要的优良品种一年比一年更多，质量要求一年比一年更高了。尤其在耕作条件变化之后，今天用的良种，明天不一定能满足新的需要。因此，必须经常不断地从良中选良，优中选优，选育出新的良种，及时繁殖推广；在推广过程中继续再选育更优良的品种。几年来，各地都已经选育出一批比较优良的新品种，如福建的高产早熟白麦、贵州和山东的早熟丰产的油菜等等。这些品种不但能适应当地自然条件，而且增产比较显著。今年所有这样的品种，都应有计划地选留起来，一粒不吃，一颗不混，全部留下作种。这对争取今后更大丰收，具有重要意义。
