Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: On June 22nd, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Iran (the predecessor of the People's Party of Iran), the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran on the 20th to express congratulations. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Dear Comrades of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of Iran (the predecessor of the People's Party of Iran), the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm and fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to all members of the People's Party of Iran.

For the past forty years, the Iranian Communists have joined the Iranian people in waging a heroic and arduous struggle to break away from the rule of imperialism and the domestic reactionary dynasty with unyielding spirit. Today, the reactionary dictatorial regime in Iran, supported by US imperialism, continues to intensify its brutal rule over the Iranian people, but they will eventually be overthrown by the Iranian people. The recent just struggles of the people of South Korea and Turkey have once again demonstrated that the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and cannot withstand the impact of the power of the masses. We firmly believe that the Iranian people's national democratic revolution against US imperialism and domestic reactionaries will surely achieve final victory.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    电贺伊朗共产党成立四十周年
    新华社21日讯　6月22日是伊朗共产党（伊朗人民党的前身）成立四十周年，中国共产党中央委员会在20日打电报给伊朗人民党中央委员会，表示祝贺。电文如下：伊朗人民党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    值此伊朗共产党（伊朗人民党的前身）建立四十周年的时候，中国共产党中央委员会谨向你们，并通过你们向伊朗人民党全体党员致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，伊朗的共产党人同伊朗人民一起，不屈不挠地为摆脱帝国主义和国内反动王朝的统治而进行了英勇艰苦的斗争。今天，伊朗的反动独裁政权在美帝国主义的扶植下仍然继续加紧对伊朗人民实行残暴的统治，但是，它们终会被伊朗人民所推翻的。最近发生的南朝鲜和土耳其人民的正义斗争，又一次说明了帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治是外强中干，抵挡不住人民群众的威力的冲击。我们深信伊朗人民反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的民族民主革命运动一定会取得最后的胜利。
