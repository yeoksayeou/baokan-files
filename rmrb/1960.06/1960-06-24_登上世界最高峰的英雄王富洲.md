    On May 17th, the Rongbuk Valley was bathed in bright sunshine. In the square of the Chinese Mountaineering Team's base camp, the five-star red flag was raised, signaling the start of the fourth assault on the summit of Mount Everest. At this solemn moment, Wang Fuzhou and all the members of the Chinese Mountaineering Team assaulting the summit raised their right hands and swore to the Party: As long as our hearts are still beating, we will resolutely contribute our strength to the Party's cause and fight to the end to conquer Mount Everest.

    This was the second time Wang Fuzhou had sworn an oath to the Party. The first time was in 1956, when he joined the Party, and he raised his right hand to swear to the Party for the cause of the proletariat and the cause of human liberation.

    This twenty-five-year-old youth was born in a rural village in Xihua County, Henan Province, a well-known flood-prone area. It was not until 1948, when Chairman Mao's army liberated eastern Henan, that warmth and happiness came to him. Under the care and education of the Party, he received higher education and was cultivated into a person with communist moral qualities.

    Wang Fuzhou, who loved labor since childhood, fell in love with nature and the mountains and rivers of the motherland in his middle school years. He was determined to become an industrial vanguard, visiting the high mountains and great rivers of the country to find resources for the country's industrial construction. Later, he finally entered the Beijing Institute of Geology. In 1957, he and his classmates went to Qaidam for an internship. On the journey, they had to travel by car for more than ten days in a row. Many classmates who had never traveled far could not adapt to this kind of life at first, eating poorly, sleeping poorly, and increasing travel fatigue, and their thoughts and emotions became abnormal. In this situation, Wang Fuzhou always silently contacted for everyone's meals, arranged accommodations, and helped classmates solve ideological problems.

    During field exploration, it was often necessary to carry luggage for dozens of miles. If things didn't go well, they would miss the lodging place and spend the night hungry in the barren mountains. At this time, Wang Fuzhou always walked at the front of the team, often carrying two or even three backpacks on his shoulders.

    Wang Fuzhou also deeply realized from field work that without a strong body, a geological worker could not well complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Therefore, although his work was relatively heavy, he insisted on regular exercise. This gave him a better physique.

    Two years ago, when Wang Fuzhou finished his university life, the Party organization also sent him and a group of mountaineering students to the Soviet Union to climb Mount Lenin, which is 7,134 meters above sea level, together with Soviet mountaineers. The Soviet elder brother gave Wang Fuzhou great care and help in all aspects of mountaineering technology and life, which made him progress rapidly.

    Last year, Wang Fuzhou, as a member of the Chinese mixed-gender mountaineering team, participated in the battle to conquer Muztagh Ata Peak in Xinjiang and climbed to its summit, which is 7,546 meters above sea level, and was awarded the title of Master of Sports.

    During the third march to conquer Mount Everest, according to the overall plan of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, a camp was to be established above 8,000 meters above sea level, and the supplies needed for the assault on the summit were to be transported there. Wang Fuzhou and other team members undertook this arduous task. On April 29th, when they set off from the top of the North Col, 7,007 meters above sea level, and advanced along the snow and ice slope, they encountered a gale, and the temperature dropped to minus 37 degrees Celsius. The breath people exhaled immediately formed a circle of white frost around their mouths, and their nostrils were sealed with ice. After walking a few steps, they had to prostrate themselves on the ground to avoid the wind and cold. Wang Fuzhou saw that whoever was tired, he would go over and take the things out of his backpack and put them in his own backpack. In the end, the things on his back became heavier and heavier.

    As the altitude rose, the oxygen in the air became thinner. It was very difficult for Wang Fuzhou to take each step. His heart was beating violently, and his breathing was intermittent, but he did not say a word and continued to persevere. When he reached 7,400 meters above sea level, he suddenly fainted due to excessive load. When he woke up, the first thing he said was: "It's okay, my physical strength is still very good, and I can continue to go up." So, he picked up his backpack and moved forward with the team.

    May 24th - the day of the assault on the summit of Mount Everest, Wang Fuzhou, the leader of the assault team, and his comrades Liu Lianman, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu tied themselves together with a rope, put on crampons, and after hugging and saying goodbye to Xu Jing, the deputy captain who stayed behind to support them, Wang Fuzhou waved his ice axe and said: "Let's go, make a final assault on Mount Everest!" At about seven o'clock that evening, they reached a place 8,700 meters above sea level and rested under a large rock. At this time, they checked the oxygen cylinders and found that the pointer of the pressure gauge had dropped sharply. Wang Fuzhou convened a temporary Party group meeting, asking everyone to reduce the oxygen flow and decided to leave Liu Lianman, who had overexerted himself. There was very little artificial oxygen, and a battle comrade with proficient mountaineering skills had to stay behind. In this very unfavorable situation, Wang Fuzhou said to his comrades: "Climbing to the summit is the task the Party has given us. We must move forward even without oxygen." At this time, Liu Lianman said: "I can't go, I can still climb!" But Wang Fuzhou again assured his comrade Liu Lianman with a firm voice: "Rest assured, we will definitely complete the task."

    The three of them continued to move forward. Wang Fuzhou shouted from time to time: "Be careful!" "Protect yourself!" This was not just a warning, but a reminder to his comrades and himself that you are not alone now, but have comrades by your side, a strong collective.

    Difficulty came again. The direction of advance "suddenly" protruded a smooth ice slope. Although the slope was only two meters long, it was such a long journey for extremely tired people! Gonbu, who was walking in front, slipped and fell with a "snap." Wang Fuzhou and Qu Yinhua then climbed up and also slipped back to the original place. Everyone was so tired that they didn't even want to say a word. Wang Fuzhou thought, can we let this small slope block us? No, we must find every possible way to get up! He stood up, tried the crampons under his feet on the ice surface again and again, and finally stabbed the ice axe hard into the ice in front of him, pulling the handle of the ice axe, and letting Qu Yinhua and Gonbu push from behind, so that he could climb up the ice slope. Then, he pulled the two people up.

    Now, it was already twelve o'clock at night, and the three people's oxygen had all been used up. They threw away the empty oxygen cylinders and moved forward with difficulty.

    Without oxygen, their legs became a thousand pounds heavy, and moving one step required several times more energy than before. They could only rest after each step. At that time, they forgot about time, forgot about the cold, and only knew how to move forward. Finally, they finally climbed to a tip where rock and snow met. At this time, Wang Fuzhou remembered to look at his watch, it was already 4:20 am on May 25th. They finally finished the "longest journey in the world" and stepped on the summit of Mount Everest. After placing the souvenirs, the three stood shoulder to shoulder, no one spoke, and they were thinking silently in their hearts: Dear Party, we have completed the arduous task you have given us.

    登上世界最高峰的英雄王富洲
    新华社记者　景家栋
    5月17日，绒布河谷阳光灿烂，在中国登山队大本营的广场上，升起了五星红旗，第四次行军突击珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的战斗就要开始了。在这庄严的时刻，王富洲和中国登山队所有突击顶峰的队员都举起右手，向党宣誓：只要我们的心还在跳动，坚决为党的事业贡献自己的力量，为攻克珠穆朗玛峰而奋斗到底。
    这是王富洲第二次向党宣誓。第一次是在1956年，那是他在入党的时候，他为无产阶级事业，为人类解放事业举起右手向党宣誓过。
    这个二十五岁的青年，出生在河南省西华县的农村里。那里是有名的黄泛区。1948年，毛主席的队伍解放了豫东，才给他带来温暖和幸福。在党的抚养教育下，使他受到了高等教育，并且把他培养成具有共产主义道德品质的人。
    从小就热爱劳动的王富洲，还在中学时代，就爱上了大自然，爱上了祖国的山河，立志要做个工业尖兵，遍访全国的高山大川，为祖国的工业建设寻找资源。后来，他终于进入了北京地质学院。1957年，他和同学到柴达木去实习。在旅途上，一连要坐十来天的汽车，许多没出过远门的同学，开始时不能适应这种生活，吃不好，睡不好，增加了旅途疲劳，思想情绪就不正常起来。在这种情况下，王富洲总是不声不响地为大家接洽膳食，安排住处，帮助同学解决思想问题。
    在野外勘察，时常要背着行李走几十里路，碰得不巧，还会错过住处，挨饿夜宿荒山。这时候，王富洲总是走在队伍的最前头，肩上的背包经常是两个，甚至三个。
    王富洲从野外工作中也深深地体会到，作为一个地质工作者，没有坚强的身体是不能很好地完成党所交给的任务的。因此，虽然自己的工作比较多，他还是坚持经常的锻炼。这就使他有了较好的体质。
    两年前，当王富洲结束了大学生活时，党组织又让他和一批登山学员一同到苏联去，和苏联登山运动员一起，共同攀登拔海七千一百三十四米的列宁峰。苏联老大哥从登山技术和生活等各方面，都给了王富洲极大的关怀和帮助，使他进步得很快。
    去年，王富洲作为中国男女混合登山队的一员，参加了征服新疆境内慕士塔格峰的战斗，并登上了它拔海七千五百四十六米的顶峰，获得了运动健将的称号。
    在征服珠穆朗玛峰的第三次行军中，按照中国登山队的总体计划，要在拔海八千米以上建立营地和把突击顶峰时所需要的物资运到那里。王富洲和其他队员担任了这个艰难的任务。4月29日，当他们从拔海七千零七米的北坳顶部出发，沿着冰雪坡前进时，遇到了狂风，气温降到摄氏零下三十七度，人们呼出的气立刻在嘴边结成一圈白霜，鼻孔被冰冻封盖住，走动几步就不得匍伏在地上躲避风寒。王富洲看到谁走累了，就过去拿下他背包里的东西，放到自己的背包里。最后，他背上的东西越来越重。
    随着拔海高度的上升，空气中的氧气更加稀薄，王富洲每走动一步都很困难，心脏在剧烈地跳动，呼吸上气不接下气，但他没有吭声，继续坚持前进。到达拔海七千四百米的地方，由于负重过多，忽然晕倒了，当他醒过来时，第一句话就说：“不要紧，我的体力还很好，能继续上。”于是，他又背起背包和队伍一同前进了。
    5月24日——突击珠穆朗玛峰顶峰这一天，担任突击小组组长的王富洲，和他的战友刘连满、屈银华、贡布结好主绳，绑上冰爪，同留下来支援的副队长许竞等人紧紧拥抱告别以后，王富洲就挥了一下冰镐说：“出发，向珠穆朗玛峰最后一段突击！”当天下午七点钟左右，他们到达了拔海八千七百米地方，在一块大岩石下休息。这时，他们检查氧气筒，发现气压表的指针大大下降。王富洲召集了临时党小组会议，要大家减少氧气流量，并决定让体力过度消耗的刘连满留下。人造氧气很少了，而登山技术熟练的战友又要留下来一个，在这种十分不利的情况下，王富洲对同志们说：“登上顶峰是党交给我们的任务，没有氧气也要前进。”这时，刘连满说：“我不能走，我还能爬！”但王富洲又以坚定的声音向战友刘连满保证说：“你安心休息，我们一定完成任务。”
    三个人又继续前进了。王富洲不时地喊着：“小心！”“保护住！”这不只是警告，而是在提醒战友和自己，你现在并不是孤独一个人，而是有着同志在身边，有着坚强的集体。
    困难又来了，前进的方向“骤然”凸起一道光溜溜的冰坡，斜坡虽然只有两米长，可是对于极度疲劳的人，它是多么长的里程啊！走在前面的贡布，“拍”的一声滑跌下来。王富洲和屈银华接着向上攀登也连续滑跌到原来的地方。大家累得连一句话也不想说。王富洲想，难道能让这个小坡挡住吗？不，想尽一切办法也要上去！他站起来，用脚下的冰爪在冰面上试了再试，最后狠狠把冰镐扎在前面的冰里，拉着冰镐的柄，让屈银华和贡布在后面推，这样才攀上冰坡。随后，他再把两个人拉上来。
    现在，已是深夜十二点，三个人的氧气已全部用光了。他们摔掉了空氧气筒，又艰难地前进了。
    断了氧，他们的腿变得有千斤重，挪动一步比先前要多付出几倍的精力，只能一步一休息。当时，他们忘记了时间，忘记了寒冷，只知道前进。最后，他们终于登上了一个岩石和积雪交界的尖端。这时，王富洲才记起看表，已是5月25日清晨四时二十分了。他们终于走完了“世界上最长的里程”，把珠穆朗玛峰顶峰踩在脚下。他们安放好纪念品以后，三个人肩并肩地站在一起，谁也没有说话，心中在默默地想着：亲爱的党啊，我们完成了你所交给的艰巨任务了。
