    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th: Hebei Province's summer harvest is unfolding fully from south to north. The harvesting work in the southern Handan area is basically complete and threshing is underway; the central Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Tianjin areas are in a tense harvesting stage; Tangshan and Chengde areas, where the summer harvest is later, will also begin harvesting one after another. Statistics up to June 7 show that the cities of Handan, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang alone have brought 12 million mu of wheat to the fields.
    High speed and high standards are the prominent features of this year's summer harvest in Hebei. People's communes in various places have universally organized professional teams, adopting a one-stop approach of harvesting, transporting, threshing, and storing. They have also launched a technical innovation movement centered on reforming and creating summer harvest tools. The entire province's summer harvest presents an excellent situation of being both fast and good.
    Mutual cooperation has also been carried out between communes and teams. According to statistics from the Handan area, 121 cotton-producing production teams mobilized more than 70,000 laborers and more than 99,000 livestock, helping 955 production teams with larger summer harvest tasks complete their summer harvest tasks in a timely manner under the principle of equivalent exchange. Cadres from various agencies, factory workers, officers and soldiers of the stationed troops, teachers and students of schools, etc., have all organized large forces to go to the countryside for emergency harvesting. During the summer harvest, all localities also paid special attention to achieving a bumper harvest, ensuring every grain goes to the granary.
    While carrying out the summer harvest, all parts of Hebei Province are also promptly carrying out summer planting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: Shanxi Province's wheat harvesting work is rapidly developing from south to north. From the Zhongtiao Mountains and the Lüliang Mountains to the banks of the Yellow River and the Fen River, there is a busy scene of rushing to harvest. As of June 8, more than 5 million mu of wheat had been harvested throughout the province. In Ruicheng, Pinglu, Yuanqu, and other counties where the harvesting started earlier, more than half of the wheat fields have been harvested; Yuncheng, Linyi, Jishan, Wanrong, Wenxi, Yicheng and other counties harvest 80,000 to 100,000 mu of wheat every day, achieving reaping as it ripens.
    This year's winter wheat in Shanxi Province is generally tall, with large ears and full grains. From the sowing of wheat until before the harvest, although all parts of the province suffered drought, wheat stripe rust, wheat aphids, red spider mites, and late frost damage were also more serious than in previous years. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people in the wheat-producing areas did everything possible to build water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than half compared to the same period last year. At the same time, they applied topdressing fertilizer once or twice to more than 60% of the wheat fields and repeatedly extinguished various pests and diseases, thus ensuring a bumper wheat harvest.
    After the wheat harvest began, all localities universally organized labor rationally, reformed harvesting tools, and organized the elderly and children to glean grain, so that the work of harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing wheat was done quickly and well. In Linyi County, four professional teams composed of more than 100,000 people, responsible for cutting, transporting, threshing, and gleaning, cooperated with each other in the rush harvest, harvesting more than 140,000 mu of wheat per day, and ensuring that the wheat harvested on the same day was transported on the same day, leaving the ground clear. All localities have also built large-scale field comprehensive harvesting points, implementing on-site construction of threshing floors, harvesting, transporting, threshing, sun-drying, and storing at the same time, which not only saves transportation power but also reduces grain loss, ensuring that every grain enters the warehouse.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th: The summer coarse grain crops sown in Shaanxi Province this year have achieved a bumper harvest. At present, all localities are rushing to harvest. As of the 3rd, 37.2% of the province had been harvested. The three districts in southern Shaanxi, where harvesting started earlier, have mostly completed the harvest.
    This year, summer coarse grain crops throughout the province have generally grown well. The Quanping Production Team of the Lengshui Commune Yueiri Management Area in Baihe County cultivated seventeen mu of high-yield pea fields, which, after harvesting, threshing, and weighing, averaged as high as 587 jin per mu. The 11,350 mu of barley, peas, and broad beans harvested by the Fusai Commune in Shiquan County averaged 148 jin per mu. The potatoes harvested in many places are also abundant.

    随黄随收　精割细打　颗粒归仓
    河北山西麦收一片大好景象
    陕西各地抢收豌豆蚕豆大麦等夏杂粮
    据新华社天津10日电　河北省夏收工作从南到北全面展开。南部邯郸地区收割工作已基本完毕，正在突击打场；中部的石家庄、保定、天津地区正处在收割紧张阶段；夏收较晚的唐山、承德地区也将陆续开镰收割。到6月7日统计，仅邯郸、天津、石家庄三市就有一千二百万亩小麦登场。
    高速度、高标准是今年河北夏收的显著特点。各地人民公社普遍组织了专业队，采取收割、运输、打场、入库一条龙的办法，并开展了以改制、创制夏收工具为中心的技术革新运动，全省夏收呈现出又快又好的大好形势。
    各地社与社、队与队之间还互相开展协作，城镇各行各业齐到农村支援。据邯郸地区统计，有一百二十一个棉区生产队，出动了七万多名劳力和九万九千多头牲口，在等价交换的原则下帮助夏收任务较大的九百五十五个生产队及时完成了夏收任务。各地机关干部、工厂职工、驻军官兵、学校师生等都组织了大批力量下乡进行抢收。在夏收中，各地还特别注意做到丰产丰收，颗粒归仓。
    在夏收同时，河北省各地及时进行了夏种。
    据新华社太原9日电　山西省的小麦收割工作正由南向北迅猛发展，从中条山、吕梁山区到黄河、汾河沿岸到处都是一片繁忙的抢收景象。截至6月8日，全省已收割小麦五百多万亩。开镰较早的芮城、平陆、垣曲等县，全部麦田已收割了一半以上；运城、临猗、稷山、万荣、闻喜、翼城等县每日都收割小麦八万至十万亩，做到随黄随收。
    今年山西省的冬小麦普遍株高穗大，颗粒饱满。从小麦下种一直到收获之前，全省各地虽然遭到干旱，小麦的条锈病和麦蚜虫、红蜘蛛等病虫害和晚霜冻害也较往年严重。但是，各产麦区人民在党的领导下，千方百计修水利，使灌溉面积比去年同期扩大了一半多。同时，给60％以上的麦田施了一至二次追肥，一次又一次地扑灭各种病虫害，因而保证了小麦丰收。
    麦收开始以后，各地普遍合理组织劳动力，改革收割工具，组织老年、儿童拣粮，使小麦的收、打、运、藏等工作做得又快又好。临猗县由十万多人组成的割、运、打、拾四支专业队伍，在抢收中互相配合，日收割小麦十四万多亩，并且做到当天收割的当天运，地光路净。各地还大建田间综合收割点，实行就地建场，边割、边运、边打、边晒、边入库，既节省了运输力量，又减少了脱粒损失，保证了颗粒入仓。
    据新华社西安9日电　陕西省今年播种的夏杂粮作物获得了丰收。目前各地正在抢收。到3日止，全省已收割37．2％，收割较早的陕南三个专区，大部分已收割完毕。
    今年，全省夏杂粮作物普遍生长良好。白河县冷水公社月日管理区全平生产队，培育的十七亩豌豆丰产方，经过收打过秤，平均亩产高达五百八十七斤。石泉县福洒公社收打的一万一千三百五十多亩大麦、豌豆、蚕豆，平均亩产一百四十八斤。不少地方收获的洋芋也是丰收。
