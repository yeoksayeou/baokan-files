Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an observer's article on the 12th, issuing a warning to U.S. imperialism and the hot-headed Japanese reactionaries colluding with the United States. The article stated that the situation in the Far East will not be determined solely by U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries. "The Soviet Union cannot tolerate threats to its security and any infringements on its sovereignty. The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to new aggressive actions by the United States and its running dogs."

The article exposed the U.S. attempt to turn Japan into its main military base. The article wrote that the purpose of U.S. imperialism's policy towards Japan after the war was: to attempt to prevent Japan from developing along the path of peace, independence, and cooperation with all peace-loving countries; the United States intends to completely drag Japan into the U.S. military aggression bloc system with the help of a new military treaty; the United States wants to establish an extremely reactionary revanchist rule in Japan, turning the country into its dependency and a tool for the United States to carry out new adventures in the Far East; they want to turn Japan into a bunker, hoping that this bunker can protect the United States from retaliation in the event that the United States launches a war of aggression.

"Pravda" then pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is not a treaty of peace, but a treaty for preparing new wars and carrying out aggression. The Soviet Union and Japan's other neighbors have not threatened Japan with attack.

"Pravda" then wrote: "Once the U.S.-Japan military treaty comes into effect, Japan will accelerate its advance on the road of militarism and aggression following the United States. Then, only the ruling classes of the United States and Japan will be responsible for this."

    “真理报”观察家谴责日美军事条约
    苏联不能漠视美日侵略行动
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”12日发表观察家的文章，对美帝国主义和同美国勾结的、头脑发热的日本反动派提出了警告。文章说，远东的局势不会只取决于美帝国主义者和日本反动派。“苏联不能容忍对它的安全的威胁和对它的主权的任何侵犯，苏联不能对美国及其走狗的新的侵略行动漠然视之”。
    文章揭露了美国把日本变成它的主要军事基地的企图。文章写道，美帝国主义者战后对日本的政策的目的是：企图阻挠日本沿着和平、独立和同一切爱好和平的国家合作的道路发展；美国打算借助新的军事条约彻底地把日本拖进美国的军事侵略集团体系中；美国想在日本建立极端反动的复仇主义统治，把这个国家变成它的附庸国，变成美国在远东进行新的冒险活动的工具；他们想把日本变成一个掩体，想使这个掩体在一旦美国发动侵略战争时能使美国免遭回击。
    “真理报”接着指出，日美“安全条约”不是和平的条约，而是准备新战争和进行侵略的条约。苏联和日本的其他邻国都没有以进攻来威胁日本。
    “真理报”接着写道：“一旦美日军事条约生效，日本就将跟在美国后面在军国主义和侵略的道路上加速前进，那么，要对此负责的只有美国和日本的统治阶级。”
