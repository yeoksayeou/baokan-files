After the entire workforce of the Fenghuangshan Iron Mine in Jiangsu Province overfulfilled half of the annual state plan for ore production on June 4th, they are advancing victoriously, determined to increase the annual plan by another 600,000 tons to support the great leap forward of the metallurgical industry.

While focusing on "Surpassing June over May, completing the half-year task ahead of schedule," the mine's Party committee considered the current leaping forward situation on the metallurgical front. After research, it put forward the battle call of "One mine acts as two, increasing another 600,000 tons" to the entire workforce. The entire workforce enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party committee, offering suggestions for key problems, putting forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, and creating a new upsurge in production where everyone is engaged in innovation, tackles key issues, strives for high output, and creates miracles.

The secretary of the mine's Party committee, the mine manager, and other leading cadres took turns leading the staff of the departments to go deep into the front line of production and fought side by side with the workers to solve key problems, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers. For example, the transportation shift efficiency of Wang Nianzhang, Gao Jigen, Wang Shuhui, and other groups in the processing workshop transportation section rose linearly from 50 trips to 105 trips, creating a new record since the establishment of the mine. The daily output of ore increased more than doubled.

    上半年大超产　下半年再加码
    江苏省凤凰山铁矿全体职工，在6月4日提前完成矿石生产全年国家计划的一半以后，乘胜前进，决心把全年计划再增加六十万吨，支援冶金工业大跃进。
    这个矿的党委在大抓“6月超5月，半年任务提前完”的同时，考虑到当前冶金战线上的跃进形势，经过研究以后，向全体职工提出了“一矿顶两矿，再增六十万吨”的战斗号召。全体职工热烈响应党委号召，针对关键问题大献计策，共提出合理化建议一千多条，掀起了人人搞革新、攻关键、闹高产、创奇迹的生产新高潮。
    矿党委书记、矿长等领导干部轮班率领科室人员深入生产第一线，和工人一道并肩战斗，解决关键问题，大大鼓舞了职工的干劲。如加工车间运输工段王念章、高继根、王淑惠等小组的运输台班效率，由五十趟直线上升到一百零五趟，创造了建矿以来的新纪录。矿石日产量猛增一倍多。
