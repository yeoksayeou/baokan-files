    Return Knowledge to the Laboring People
    ——On Tong Huiwen, from Literacy Teacher to University Lecturer
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Lijun
    As soon as I arrived in Tianjin, I heard that Tong Huiwen, a literacy teacher, was teaching "Analytic Geometry" at the university level. I rushed to the Tianjin Amateur Electrical Engineering University, and the bell rang to end the class. The employees of the electrical system came out of the first-year classroom, each with a satisfied expression. Shi Jianmin, a technician from the Dispatch Section of the Tianjin Electrical Power Bureau, said to me, "Teacher Tong has demystified analytic geometry." Wang Shaorong, a shift worker from the substation, eagerly chimed in, "He has grasped the characteristics of us adults – strong comprehension but poor memory – and his lectures emphasize key points and are easy to understand. He knows where we'll have problems and helps us get to the root of them."
    The students couldn't stop talking about the good things about Tong Huiwen. They call Tong Huiwen's teaching method a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Yang Shaowen, a substation apprentice, is an excellent student. He immediately wrote down the three-line mnemonic rhyme that Tong Huiwen compiled and drew a diagram to explain it to me, saying, "These three sentences help us memorize the forty-eight formulas for calculating angle function values all at once, solving many problems!" It turns out that this is the result of Tong Huiwen absorbing the teaching experience of other teachers and flexibly applying it to his teaching.
    In this class, there are technicians and workers from various production departments, such as substations, power supply, power generation, and power transmission; some had a high school or university education, while others were junior high school graduates. However, Tong Huiwen's teaching won unanimous praise from them all.
    Tong Huiwen, this twenty-six-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, was just a literacy teacher with a higher primary school education four years ago. In the past few years, under the guidance of the Party, he has studied diligently and worked hard, learning and teaching simultaneously, and has rapidly grown into a university mathematics teacher. Now, he is still learning and teaching at the same time, teaching analytic geometry while taking a course in calculus at Tianjin University, preparing to teach it next semester.
    The path that Tong Huiwen has taken proves that the Party's instructions are correct. Learning while teaching, the water rises as the boat rises; it is entirely possible to cultivate teachers at high speed.

    The Road is Made by Walking
    In 1956, the Tianjin electrical system, as the vanguard of industry, saw a situation of high-speed development. New factories were constantly being built, and new units were constantly being put into production. Workers were eager to break away from the backward state of culture and technology and become masters of the equipment. The situation was pressing, and the Tianjin Electrical Power Bureau's amateur secondary technical school came into being. When the school was first established, it had only one principal and one teacher. Tong Huiwen was the clerk who handled the school's food, finances, and all the odd jobs, as well as a literacy teacher.
    "The road is made by walking, and conditions are created by people." Principal Pan Qinghui said, "As long as we show soaring drive and bring our subjective initiative into play, learning when we don't know, learning while teaching, it is possible to cultivate our own full-time teachers at high speed." His principle was to "teach what you need, learn what you need, make up what you lack, and advance in a single subject for rapid training." It was under his supervision that Tong Huiwen, while working as a clerk, entered the amateur teacher training college to make up for junior high school courses. By 1958, the amateur electrical engineering secondary technical school had added a preparatory class for technical secondary school. Without a teacher, Pan Qinghui had Tong Huiwen, who had just finished his junior high school courses, take on the role.
    The workers' desire to acquire knowledge was deeply felt by Tong Huiwen, who came from an urban poor family. Before liberation, he suffered the pain of being out of school. It was not until the liberation of Tianjin that the working people had the opportunity to learn culture, and he was able to graduate from an amateur higher primary school. After graduating from higher primary school, he became a literacy teacher. From the first day he served as a literacy teacher, he was determined to contribute to the intellectualization of the working class. But he never thought that he, who had never even taught higher primary school courses, would suddenly be teaching junior high school.
    Just as he was hesitating about his teaching, Pan Qinghui came to encourage him, saying: You can only learn to swim by going into the water first; there is no such thing as learning before doing in revolutionary work. Only by learning and doing in practical work and treating work with the spirit of continuous revolution can we overcome difficulties and advance victoriously.
    Pan Qinghui had him prepare for a trial lecture.
    The topic of the trial lecture was algebraic expressions. Tong Huiwen buried himself in preparing for a few days, but he still wasn't sure. When he stepped onto the podium, he felt flustered and confused, and he presented the tight content of the book in a disjointed manner. He finished only twenty minutes of the forty-five-minute content. After this class, the teachers commented on his lecture. Pan Qinghui encouraged him, saying, "Even a university professor can fail when he gives a new lecture for the first time. The main problem is to deeply grasp the teaching material and express it in your own language."
    Tong Huiwen realized that the acquisition of any knowledge is by no means easy and requires hard work. He was not discouraged by the failure of this trial teaching but instead, it became a force to spur him on. In order to give good lectures, he read the teaching materials ten or twenty times and often prepared lessons late into the night. He also often went to empty classrooms to rehearse again and again until every word he wanted to say in each class was engraved in his heart and the arrangement of oral and board statements was properly arranged before he stopped.
    At the very beginning of teaching, he always avoided the students, fearing that they would ask questions that he would not know the answer to. Therefore, he would enter the classroom only after the bell rang for class and leave as soon as the bell rang after class. But he gradually realized how irresponsible this was. In addition to making thorough preparations beforehand, teachers can only help students understand how well they are learning through tutoring and Q&A. So he stopped avoiding the students and took the initiative to learn about the learning situation among the students and established a close friendship with them. In this way, he gradually mastered the learning patterns of the employees, and the more he taught, the more experienced he became, and the better he taught.

    By the end of 1958, when the technical secondary school preparatory class taught by Tong Huiwen finished reviewing the junior high school mathematics and physics courses in half a year, the employees were no longer satisfied with improving from junior high school to technical secondary school graduation level in five years. They demanded a higher speed, demanding to improve to the university graduation level in five and a half years. Therefore, a new task of educational revolution was placed before all the teachers of the school: to run an amateur electrical engineering university and teach the most essential and useful knowledge to the employees in the shortest possible time. The technical secondary school preparatory class was to be transformed into a university preparatory class. Pan Qinghui then had Tong Huiwen teach alongside the class, spending one year helping the students in the technical secondary school preparatory class review the high school mathematics - algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
    For Tong Huiwen, if teaching junior high school algebra was mainly a matter of spending time getting familiar with the teaching materials, then teaching high school courses required him to spend ten times as much time mastering it and being proficient in it. Learning, memorizing, and lecturing became the keys to his lesson preparation. Especially trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent,... at first, these symbols confused him. He wrote the symbols and formulas on cards like square characters, memorizing them early in the morning and late at night, and not even letting go of the few minutes while walking. He mastered knowledge with the perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and conquered time with the spirit of seizing every minute and second.

    Draw Nourishment from Collective Wisdom
    Even so, learning while teaching, Tong Huiwen inevitably had places where he did not understand or comprehend thoroughly, but the Party was always concerned about him. Whenever he encountered difficulties, he would receive timely help from the Party organization and gain strength from the collective. In Tianjin, he could go to universities or middle schools to attend classes at any time, and the mathematics teachers in the same school were even more mutually beneficial and cooperative teachers and friends. Once, when Tong Huiwen talked about not understanding the chapter "The Meaning of Real Number Operations" while eating, the teacher Liu Yingchun immediately put down his rice bowl and took him into the classroom, where the two of them, one as a teacher and the other as a student, lectured earnestly.
    At the end of 1959, the Tianjin Electrical Power Bureau held a bureau-wide teaching performance competition. The content of the performance competition was to talk about a chapter in high school algebra: how to solve application problems. Three teachers participated in the performance: one was a university graduate, one was a high school graduate, and one was Tong Huiwen. When preparing for the lesson, Tong Huiwen and the two mathematics teachers Liu Yingchun and Weng Zhufang jointly conducted research and decided that solving application problems should start from reality, so they looked for examples from production to explain theoretical problems. In order to strengthen the teaching effect, they also made teaching aids. As a result of the competition, Tong Huiwen's lecture received the best evaluation.
    Although Tong Huiwen has continuously achieved success in teaching, he has not been complacent in the slightest. He takes Chairman Mao's words: "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind" as his motto.
    Thanks to Tong Huiwen's efforts, by the end of 1959, when the university preparatory class graduated, more than 92% of the more than 100 students in this class who took the mathematics exam reached the standard required by the school, of which more than 70% scored four or more points. Starting this year, he is teaching alongside the class again, serving as the teacher of "Analytic Geometry". (Attached picture)

    把知识还给劳动人民
    ——记从扫盲教师到大学教师的童会文
    本报记者　张丽君
    一到天津，就听说扫盲教师童会文在教大学“解析几何”的课程。赶到天津市业余电业大学，下课铃声响了。从一年级教室里走出来的电业系统的职工，一个个带着满意的神色。天津市电业局调度科技术员石健民对我说：“童老师打破了解析几何的神秘关。”变电站的值班工人王绍荣抢着说：“他抓住了我们成年人理解强、忘性大的特点，讲得重点突出，通俗易懂。知道我们那里会有疙瘩，就帮助我们挖根。”……。
    学员们一谈起童会文的好处，就没有个完。他们称童会文的教学方法是土洋结合。变电站的徒工杨绍文是个优秀学员。他当场写下童会文编的三句顺口溜，并且画出图表来向我解释说：“这三句话就帮助我们一下子记住了计算角度函数值的四十八个公式，多解决问题！”原来这是童会文吸取了其他教师的教学经验，灵活地应用到教学中去的结果。
    这个班的学员中，有变电、供电、发电、输电等各个生产部门的技术员和工人；原有的文化程度有上过高中或大学的，也有初中毕业的。可是童会文的教学博得了他们异口同声的赞扬。
    童会文这个才二十六岁的共青团员，四年以前还是一个只具有高小程度的扫盲教师。几年来，他在党的教导下，苦学苦干，边学边教，迅速成长为大学的数学教师。现在，他仍然边教边学，一边教解析几何，一边在天津大学进修微积分，准备下学期开课。
    童会文走过的道路证明党的指示是正确的。边教边学，水涨船高，用高速度培养教师是完全可能的。
    路是人走出来的
    1956年，天津市电业系统作为工业的先行官，出现了高速度发展的局面。新厂不断的建立，新机组不断的投入生产。工人们迫切地要求摆脱文化技术的落后状态，成为设备的主人。形势逼人，天津市电业局的业余中等技术学校就应运而生。当学校刚成立时，全校只有一个校长和一个教师。童会文是包办全校伙食、财务和一切零星杂务的事务员兼扫盲教师。
    “路是人走出来的，条件是人创造的。”校长潘庆惠说：“只要拿出冲天干劲，发挥我们的主观能动性，不会就学，边教边学，是可以高速度地培养出自己的专职教师的。”他遵循的一条原则是“教什么，学什么，缺什么，补什么，单科独进，快速培养。”童会文就是在他的督促下，一面当事务员，一面进入业余教师进修学院补学初中课程。到1958年，业余电业中技术学校增办了中技预备班。没有教师，潘庆惠就让刚进修完初中课程的童会文来担任。
    工人群众渴望获得知识的心情，对于出身城市贫民的童会文是深有体会的。解放前，他饱尝失学的痛苦。一直到天津解放，劳动人民才有学文化的机会，他才有可能从业余高小毕业。高小毕业后，他担任了扫盲教师。从他担任扫盲教师的第一天起，他就下定决心要为工人阶级知识化贡献一份力量。可是他从来没有想到：自己连高小课程都没教过，会一下子教初中。
    正当他对自己的教课表示犹豫的时候，潘庆惠就来鼓励他：先下水才能学会游泳，革命工作没有先学会以后再去干的。只有在实际工作中边学边干，并以不断革命的精神对待工作，才能克服困难，胜利前进。
    潘庆惠让他准备作一次试讲。
    试讲的一节课是代数式。童会文埋头紧张地准备了几天，可是心里还没个底。当他一走上讲台就心慌意乱，书本上严密的内容，他讲得丢三拉四。四十五分钟的内容，他才讲了二十分钟就讲完了。这一堂课下来，教师们对他的讲课进行了评议。潘庆惠鼓励他说：“即使是大学教授，当他第一次讲新课时也是可能失败的。主要问题是深入掌握教材，用自己的语言去表达它。”
    童会文体会到：任何知识的获得决不是轻而易举的，要付出艰苦的劳动。这次试教的失败，他并不气馁，却成了鞭策他继续前进的力量。为了使自己讲好课，他成十遍、二十遍地熟读教材，经常备课到深夜。他还经常到空无一人的教室里去，一次又一次地演习，直到每堂课要口述的一字一句都铭记在心，口述和板述安排妥当，才算罢休。
    刚一开始上课，他总是躲着学生，唯恐学员提问题，一问三不知。因此，上课铃打后他才进教室，下课铃一打他就走了。可是他逐渐意识到：这样做是多么不负责任。教师讲课除了事先作充分准备外，只有通过补课，有问有答，才能帮助教师了解学员究竟学得怎样。于是他不再躲着学员了，主动地到学员中去了解学习情况，和学员建立了亲如手足的友谊。这样他就逐步地掌握了职工学习的规律，越教经验越丰富，越教越教得好。
    当1958年底，童会文所教的中技预备班以半年时间复习完初中的数学和物理课程时，职工们已经不满足于用五年的时间从初中程度提高到中技毕业的水平。他们要求更高的速度，要求用五年半的时间提高到大学毕业的水平。于是一项新的教育革命的任务又摆在全校教师面前了：要举办业余电业大学，用最短的时间，把最本质、最有用的知识教给职工。中技预备班要转为大学预备班。潘庆惠又让童会文跟班教学，用一年时间帮助中技预备班的学员复习完高中的数学——代数、几何和三角。
    对于童会文来说，如果说教初中代数的时候主要是付出时间去熟悉教材的问题，那么，教高中的课程就需要他付出成十倍的时间去掌握它，熟练它。学、背、讲成为他备课的关键。特别是三角函数，什么飞弦、余弦、正切、余切，……一开始这些符号就把他扰混了。他就把符号、公式像方块字一样写在笺上，早起背，晚上背，即使走在路上的几分钟也不放过。他以愚公移山的毅力去掌握知识，以分秒必争的精神去战胜时间。
  从集体智慧中吸取养料
    即使这样，边学边教，对于童会文仍然难免有学不懂，理解不透的地方，党时刻在关怀着他。每逢遇到困难，他就会及时地得到党组织的帮助，从集体中得到力量。在天津，他随时可以到大学或中学去听课，同校的数学教师更是互相切磋琢磨的良师益友。一次，童会文在吃饭时谈起“实数运算的意义”一章看不懂时，刘迎春教师马上放下饭碗，把他带进教室，两人一个当教师，一个当学生，认真地讲起来了。
    1959年底，天津市电业局举行了一次全局范围的教学表演赛，表演赛的内容是讲高中代数中的一个章节：如何解应用题。参加表演的有三个教师：一个是大学毕业生，一个是高中毕业生，一个就是童会文。童会文在备课时，和刘迎春、翁竹舫两位数学教师共同进行了研究，决定解应用题应从实际出发，所以他们从生产中去找实例来阐明理论问题。为了加强教学效果，他们还做了教具。比赛结果，童会文的讲课获得了最好的评价。
    童会文在教学中虽然不断地取得成绩，可是他并没有丝毫自满。他以毛主席的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”作为座右铭。
    由于童会文的努力，到1959年底，大学预备班结业时，这一班一百多人，参加数学考试的成绩，有92％达到学校要求的标准，其中四分以上的占70％。从今年起，他又跟班教学，担任“解析几何”课的教师了。（附图片）
