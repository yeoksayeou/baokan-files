Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, following the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and ensuring Party leadership in education, the Yili Women's Middle School in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, like other middle schools, has achieved considerable success in recent years.

Now, I will report on my work in leading a class in this school, specifically in the area of political and ideological education.

In my political and ideological work, first, I pay attention to constantly observing and understanding the students' ideological situation and promptly educating them. I eat, live, and labor with the students, integrating with them in life and gradually establishing a close teacher-student relationship. Through contact with the students, I gain an in-depth understanding of their ideological situation, family life, and economic circumstances, and provide timely education targeting different ideological problems. For example, I discovered that Yardanmuhan, a student from a landlord family, was unwilling to work and claimed to be sick every time there was labor. To help her establish the idea that labor is glorious, I worked with her and, during breaks, told them about the greatness and glory of labor, and raised questions for the students to discuss. In this way, the consciousness of all the students improved, and Yardanmuhan also improved her understanding and changed her past negative attitude towards labor.

Second, I pay attention to leveraging the power of the Communist Youth League in the class, strengthening ideological education for students through the League organization. For example, I work with the League branch to jointly formulate plans, integrating the class's educational plan with the League branch's educational plan. At the same time, I also require Communist Youth League members to actively play exemplary and leading roles in learning, labor, and participation in political movements. In this way, all the students in the class are closely united, forming a whole, helping each other, and advancing together.

Third, I attach great importance to grasping the students' studies and thoughts. I often have individual conversations with students to understand their understanding of learning, explain the important meaning of learning to them, and explain that learning is the most glorious task entrusted to our younger generation by the Party. We should be determined to become successors to socialist construction and good students of Chairman Mao. At the same time, I also maintain frequent contact with teachers to understand the students' learning situation and solve problems existing in their studies in a timely manner. For example, after talking with the physics teacher, I learned that student Zidegule failed three exams. After analysis and research, I realized that the reason for this student's failure was that she did not understand the lessons in class. In order to overcome this situation, we listened to the students' opinions on the teachers and promptly conveyed them to the teachers to improve their teaching methods. On the other hand, we organized teachers of relevant courses to tutor students in areas they did not understand. In addition, mutual aid groups were organized among the students to help each other. For example, when Patiguli Haji Khan was sick, the students went to her home to give her tutoring, copy notes, so that she would not be delayed in her studies due to illness.

In addition, we also conducted organizational discipline education for students, so that students realize that abiding by learning discipline can guarantee learning.

Through the above work, the students have established a correct learning attitude and increased their confidence. Therefore, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of learning.

Fourth, grasp the political lessons teaching. In addition to explaining systematic political theories and the Party's policies, political lessons also organize students to study other relevant works based on the characteristics of the students and in combination with the political movements of each period. For example, in connection with the study of the theory of continuous revolution related to the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we organized students to study the exemplary deeds of heroic figures such as Liu Hulan, and organized them to discuss their learning experiences and gains after the study, and write down their own feelings. Through the study of heroic figures, the students can absorb endless spiritual power from them and enrich and transform their spiritual outlook. At the same time, we also conducted atheistic education for students in political lessons teaching. And timely solve the students' ideological problems.

In addition, we also resolutely implemented the educational policy of "combining education with productive labor" and educated students on all vague understandings and wrong ideas about the educational policy. Various handicraft groups were organized to enable students to participate in labor; and before each labor, the purpose and meaning of the labor were explained to the students, and a summary was made after the labor. In this way, the students' labor concepts were improved. In the labor of steelmaking, digging ditches, accumulating fertilizer, and planting trees, they showed great enthusiasm. Now it can be said that there is no one who is unwilling to participate in labor.

In short, in recent years, due to our continuous strengthening of students' ideological education in the class, the students' socialist consciousness has been continuously improved, righteousness has risen, evil has declined, learning is peaceful, and achievements are remarkable, making our class one of the best classes in the school.

The reason why we have achieved the above results is due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Party committees at all levels. In the future, we must continue to unswervingly implement the Party's educational policy, study Chairman Mao's writings hard, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and do a better job of the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    我怎样对学生进行政治思想教育工作
    新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁女子中学代表  以乃提·伊敏
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，遵循着党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，教育工作要由党来领导的教育工作方针，新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁女子中学和其它中学一样，几年来取得不小的成绩。
    现在，我把自己领导这所学校中的一个班级的政治思想教育工作，作个汇报。
    我在政治思想工作中，首先，注意经常观察和了解学生的思想情况，并及时加以教育。我和学生们同吃、同住、同劳动，与学生在生活上打成一片，逐步建立起亲密的师生关系。通过与学生的接触，深入了解学生的思想情况，家庭生活与经济情况，针对不同思想问题，及时进行教育。例如，我发现牧主家庭出身的学生雅尔旦母汗不愿劳动，每次劳动就说自己有病。为了帮助她树立起劳动光荣的思想，就和她们一块劳动，利用劳动的空隙时间向她们讲述劳动的伟大和光荣，并且提出问题让同学们进行讨论。这样，全班同学们的觉悟提高了，雅尔旦母汗也提高了认识，改变了过去对劳动消极的态度。
    第二、我在班里面注意发挥共青团的力量，通过团组织的力量，加强对学生的思想教育。如我与团支部一起共同制定计划，使班内的教育计划和团支部的教育计划结合起来。同时又要求共青团员在学习、劳动和参加政治运动中积极起模范带头作用，这样把全班同学紧密地团结起来，结成一个整体，互相帮助，共同前进。
    第三、我比较重视抓同学们的学习、思想。我经常与学生进行个别交谈，了解她们对学习的认识，向她们讲解学习的重要意义，说明学习是党交给我们青年一代的最光荣的任务。我们应该立志作社会主义建设的接班人，做毛主席的好学生。同时，我也和教师经常联系，掌握学生的学习情况，及时解决学生在学习中存在的问题。如我和物理教员谈话以后，了解到学生孜的古勒三次考试都不及格，经过分析研究，了解到这个学生考试不及格的原因，是因为她在课堂上就没有听懂课。为了克服这种情况，我们一方面听取了学生对教师的意见，及时转达给教师，以改进教学方法；另一方面则组织有关课程的教师，对学生们不懂的地方进行辅导。此外，还在同学们中间组织了互助小组，使她们互相帮助。如帕提古丽哈吉汗有病了，同学们就去她家，给她补课，抄笔记，使她不致因为有病而耽误了学习。
    此外，我们还向学生进行了组织纪律教育，使学生认识到遵守学习纪律，才能保证学习。
    经过以上工作，同学们树立了正确的学习态度，增加了信心，因而，在学习质量上有了显著的提高。
    第四、抓紧学生的政治课教学工作。政治课除了讲解系统政治理论和党的方针政策外，还根据学生的特点和结合每个时期的政治运动，组织同学们学习其它有关著作。如我们结合党的八届八中全会有关不断革命论的学习，组织学生学习了刘胡兰等英雄人物的模范事迹，并在学习后组织她们座谈学习的心得和收获，写出自己的感想。使同学们通过对英雄人物的学习，从中吸取无穷的精神力量，丰富和改造自己的精神面貌。与此同时，我们还在政治课教学中，向学生进行了无神论的教育。并且针对学生的思想问题，及时加以解决。
    除此而外，我们还坚决贯彻了“教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，对学生中一切对教育方针的模糊认识和错误思想进行了教育。组织了各种手工艺小组，使同学们参加劳动；并在每次劳动前，给同学们讲这次劳动的目的和意义，劳动后进行总结，这样就提高了同学们的劳动观念。在大炼钢铁、挖渠、积肥、植树等劳动中，她们表现了很大的积极性，现在不愿意参加劳动的可以说没有了。
    总之，几年来，由于我们在班上不断加强学生的思想教育，因之，同学们的社会主义觉悟不断提高，正气上升，邪气下降，学习安心，成绩显著，使我们这个班已经成为全校最好的班级之一。
    我们所以取得上述成绩，是由于党中央毛主席和各级党委正确领导的结果。今后，我们一定要继续坚定不移地贯彻党的教育方针，努力学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东的思想武装自己，把党所交给的任务做得更好。
