Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 20th: The Lao Patriotic Front Party has issued an appeal to the people, calling on people from all walks of life and all democratic parties to unite and wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against the Phoui Sananikone-Phoumi Nosavan dictatorial government and against the deceptive and arbitrary elections.

The appeal also demands that truly free and democratic elections be held again, that a new national democratic assembly be formed, and that both sides meet to negotiate on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements in order to stop the civil war and restore security and unity to Laos.

The appeal, published on June 10th by "Lao Patriotic News," states that the American imperialists and their lackeys, the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" and the leaders of the People's Social Party, disregarding the wishes of the people of the whole country, have trampled on the constitution and democratic freedoms. The government program they have prescribed is extremely reactionary. Domestically, they will continue the civil war, carrying out "sweeps," suppression, and village consolidation, concentrating residents according to the so-called "rural consolidation plan." In foreign affairs, they are dependent on American imperialism, turning Laos into an American colony and military base, and continuing to undermine the path of peace and neutrality that the Lao people want to take.

The appeal emphasizes that "faced with the vicious actions of the leaders of the 'Committee for the Defence of National Interests' and the ever-deepening interference of American imperialism, there is only one path for our people: to overthrow the military dictatorship of the leaders of the 'Committee for the Defence of National Interests', to repel the conspiracy of American imperialist interference, and to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, so that Laos can truly take the path of peace and neutrality."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 21st: "Lao Patriotic News" published on June 13th an appeal from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on June 12th to the officers and soldiers of the Royal Lao Army, calling on them not to be tools of the reactionary clique to bring disaster to the country and harm the people, not to "sweep" and massacre the people, but to work together to support the national struggle for salvation.

The appeal stated: "The action of American imperialism in letting its most effective lackeys take power is a new step in their plan to turn Laos into an American colony and war base."

The appeal stated that under the direction of their American masters, the government formed by Phoui Sananikone, Phoumi Nosavan, and Khamphan Panya falsely claims to be taking the path of peace and neutrality and restoring peace to the country. However, you have seen with your own eyes in the past year that their actions are to continue the civil war and massacre the people, and the suffering of the Lao people is the result of their policy of dependence on the United States and provoking civil war.

The appeal stated that the leaders of the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests," the faithful lackeys of American imperialism, have used you, forced you to "sweep" and massacre the people, and forced you to serve the interests of American imperialism, the enemy of the Lao people, causing thousands of you to lose your lives in vain. Therefore, in the past, especially during the general election, many of you expressed hatred for the traitors and sympathy for the people, the most representative of which was the brave action of the nine soldiers who helped Prince Souphanouvong escape safely from prison.

The appeal stated that at present, Phoumi Nosavan, Phoui Sananikone, and Khamphan Panya are stepping up their efforts to serve the plans of American imperialism for interference and provocation. The duty of the national army is to defend the motherland and the people. Are you willing to let these thugs exchange the blood of the Lao people for US dollars, and sell the future of the motherland, the happiness of the people, and your own lives and happiness, as well as those of your families, to American imperialism in exchange for their personal official positions and enjoyment?

The appeal stated that for the sake of the power of the motherland and the supreme interests of the people, everyone should work together to support the national struggle for salvation.

    老挝爱国战线党发表告人民书
    团结起来打倒亲美独裁政府
    号召王国军队官兵支持人民救国斗争
    新华社河内20日电　老挝爱国战线党发表告人民书，号召全国各阶层人民和各民主政党团结起来，进行坚决的、不屈的斗争，反对昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万独裁政府，反对欺骗和独断的大选。
    告人民书还要求重新举行真正自由和民主的大选，成立民族民主的新国会，要求双方会晤，在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上进行协商，以停止内战，恢复老挝的安全和统一。
      “老挝爱国新闻”6月10日刊登的这项告人民书说，美帝国主义及其走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”和人民社会党的头目们，不顾全国人民的愿望，蹂躏了宪法和民主自由权利。他们所规定的政府纲领是极其反动的。在对内方面，他们将继续进行内战，“扫荡”、镇压和并村，根据所谓“巩固农村的计划”集中居民。在对外方面，他们依附美帝国主义，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，继续破坏老挝人民要走的和平中立的道路。
    告人民书强调指出，“面对着‘保卫国家利益委员会’头目们的凶恶行为，面对着美帝国主义日益加深的干涉，我国人民只有一条唯一的道路：就是打倒‘保卫国家利益委员会’头目们的军事独裁制度，打退美帝国主义的干涉阴谋，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，使老挝真正走和平中立的道路。”
    新华社河内21日电　“老挝爱国新闻”6月13日发表了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会6月12日给老挝王国军队官兵号召书，号召他们不当反动派祸国殃民的工具，不去“扫荡”和残杀人民，而同心协力支持全国人民的救国斗争。
    号召书说：“美帝国主义让它最得力的走狗掌握政权这个行动，是它们把老挝变成美国的殖民地和战争基地的计划中的新步骤。”
    号召书说，在美国主子指使下，昭·松萨尼特、富米·诺萨万、坎番·班雅集团组成的政府诡称走和平中立的道路和恢复国家的安宁。但是，你们在去年一年中亲眼看到了它们的行动是继续内战、残杀人民，老挝人民所遭受的惨祸是它们依附美国、挑起内战政策的结果。
    号召书说，美帝国主义的忠实走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们利用了你们，强迫你们去“扫荡”和残杀人民，强迫你们为老挝人民的敌人美帝国主义的利益服务，使你们当中的成千人白白地送了命。因此，在过去期间，特别是在大选时，你们许多人表示憎恨卖国贼，同情人民，其中最有代表性的是帮助苏发努冯亲王安全脱狱的九个士兵的勇敢行动。
    号召书说，目前，富米·诺萨万，昭·松萨尼特，坎番·班雅正在加紧为美帝国主义的干涉和挑战计划效劳。国家军队的义务是保卫祖国、保卫人民，难道你们甘心情愿让这些暴徒拿老挝人的血来换美元，把祖国的未来、人民的幸福和你们自己以及你们家属的生命和幸福，出卖给美帝国主义来换取他们个人的官位和享乐吗？
    号召书说，为了祖国的政权，为了人民的最高利益，大家应当同心协力地支持全国人民的救国斗争。
