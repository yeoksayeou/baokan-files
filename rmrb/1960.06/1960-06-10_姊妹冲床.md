    "Sister Punch Presses"
    Fang Zixing, Worker at Beijing Jinxing Pen Factory
    We have two girls in our workshop,
    Who look like twin sisters:
    Their faces are red, like bright spring flowers,
    Their eyes are round, like the bright moon on an autumn night.
    The elder sister's personality is straightforward and strong,
    Nicknamed a fierce general like Zhang Fei;
    The younger sister's temperament is quiet and reserved,
    Everyone calls her the resourceful Little Wang.
    At a technical innovation mobilization meeting,
    The secretary's report was sonorous and impassioned.
    Everyone listened with shining eyes,
    Everyone felt like they had wings!
    During the discussion, the elder sister was the first to speak,
    She suddenly stood up and raised her hand:
    "To realize the 'Four Modernizations,' we women workers will lead the way,
    We dare to compete with the male comrades!"
    Before her voice faded, applause roared like a tsunami,
    The male workers whispered to each other in praise.
    The younger sister, lost in thought, didn't say a word,
    An automatic punch press appeared before her eyes.
    The morning stars twinkled as the workshop bell rang,
    Until the sun slowly peeked out to look around:
    The younger sister tightly gripped the iron tongs, wielding a fiery dragon,
    The elder sister swung a large hammer overhead.
    Welcoming one round of sunrise after another,
    Seeing off one night after another;
    After one improvement after another,
    After one installation after another.
    The wind is gentle and the sun is bright, a beautiful spring scene,
    The workshop workers are vying to see a happy event:
    "Blanking" is no longer a sweaty task,
    With a tap of the toe, the steel sheet obediently enters the chamber.
    The punch head jumps rapidly like raindrops,
    One product after another flows under the punch press.
    Suddenly, the elder sister hurriedly called to the younger sister to wait:
    "Quick! Change to another material-receiving basket."
    On the factory's gate's honor roll,
    The sisters' photos shine brightly.
    Like two fresh flowers on the same branch,
    Blooming in the sun's radiant glow!

    Early Exercises
    Chen Wenhe
    Birds chirp in the trees,
    Spring City wakes up early.
    The loudspeaker shouts "Commands,"
    Housewives do gymnastics.
    "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."
    Grandma in her seventies also bends over.
    Little brother, don't laugh,
    Look how well grandma is doing.
    The commune brings a new life,
    Old trees meet spring and sprout new shoots.

    “姊妹冲床”
    北京金星笔厂工人　方孜行
    我们车间有两位姑娘，
    像孪生姊妹一个模样：
    脸儿红红似春天鲜艳的花朵，
    眼睛圆圆如秋夜皎洁的月亮。
    姊姊的性格直爽刚强，
    绰号叫赛张飞的猛将；
    妹妹的脾气沉默寡言，
    都称她为智多星小王。
    一次技术革新的动员会上，
    书记的报告字字铿锵豪壮。
    人人听得目光炯炯，
    个个心上插了翅膀！
    讨论时姊姊第一个开腔，
    她倏地站起身把手一扬：
    “实现‘四化’我们女工开道，
    敢和男同志们比武较量！”
    话音未落掌声如海啸雷响，
    男工们交头接耳同声赞扬。
    妹妹正痴思凝想一言不发，
    眼前浮现着一台自动冲床。
    晨星点点车间里钟声叮当，
    直打得太阳慢慢探头张望：
    妹妹紧握铁钳舞着一条火龙，
    姊姊手中的大锤在头顶摇晃。
    迎来一轮又一轮朝阳，
    送走一个又一个晚上；
    经过一回又一回改进，
    作了一次又一次安装。
    风和日丽好一片明媚春光，
    车间工人争看着喜事一桩：
    “毛坯落料”不再是满头大汗，
    脚尖一踩钢皮就乖乖进膛。
    冲头像雨点般急骤跳荡，
    一件件产品在冲床下流淌。
    忽地，姊姊忙叫妹妹等等：
    “快！再换一只盛料的筐筐。”
    工厂大门口的光荣榜上，
    姊妹俩的相片闪着光芒。
    像同一枝上的两朵鲜花，
    在阳光普照下争艳怒放！
    早操
    陈文和树上鸟儿噪，
    春城醒得早。
    喇叭筒里喊“口令”，
    家庭妇女做体操。
    “一二三四五六七……”
    七十奶奶也弯腰。
    小弟弟呀你别笑，
    你看奶奶操多好。
    公社带来新生活，
    老树逢春发新梢。
