    Yankee Imperialists Get Out of Taiwan!
    Representative of Demobilized and Retired Soldiers Yang Yumin
    Comrades of the Entire Militia:
    I represent all demobilized and retired soldiers in the capital in denouncing the most ferocious enemy of the world's people—Yankee imperialism. After the outbreak of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, I joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and, together with the Korean People's Army, defeated the American aggressors. After our army entered Korea, it fought the American imperialist aggressors in several battles. Countless facts have proved that the invaders are vulnerable and outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tigers, and have long been exposed in front of the Chinese and Korean people.
    Now Yankee imperialism has been forcibly occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan for a full ten years. For more than ten years, Yankee imperialism has committed countless crimes against the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries of the world, and has been strongly resisted by the people of the world. In Korea, Cuba, Japan, and other places, American imperialism has suffered disgraceful defeats. However, Yankee imperialism has not learned its lesson and changed its aggressive nature. On the contrary, Yankee imperialism is intensifying its policy of aggression. A few days ago, American imperialism even sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, which once again exposed its ferocious aggressive face. Recently, it has intensified its arms expansion and war preparations, plotting to further enslave the people of all countries. The head of Yankee imperialism, Eisenhower, even personally sneaked into our sacred territory of Taiwan, stepped up the creation of "two Chinas," and further plotted new wars. Eisenhower's bandit behavior is an open provocation to our 650 million people, and the Chinese people express great anger at this. We must liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.
    I am a demobilized soldier, and I was once a soldier in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. I want to warn American imperialism, warn Eisenhower, your bandit army is our defeated foe! If you have forgotten the heavy lessons of the Korean War and dare to launch a new war of aggression, all of us demobilized soldiers will return to the front line and defeat you utterly, completely eliminating the invaders from the earth!
    Let us shout: Yankee imperialism get out of our sacred territory of Taiwan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of Asia!

### 美帝国主义滚出台湾去

    美帝国主义滚出台湾去
    转业退伍军人代表  杨毓敏全体民兵同志们：
    我代表首都所有转业退伍军人痛斥世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。1950年6月美帝国主义侵朝战争爆发后，我曾参加中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军一道，打败了美国侵略军。我军进入朝鲜以后，在几次战役中曾和美帝侵略军较量过。无数事实证明，侵略者是不堪一击的、外强中干的纸老虎，在朝中人民面前早已原形毕露了。
    现在美帝国主义武装侵占我国神圣领土台湾已经整整十年了。十年多以来，美帝国主义对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民犯下了无数的罪行，遭到了全世界人民的强烈反抗，在朝鲜、在古巴、在日本等地，美国帝国主义都已经遭到了可耻的失败。但是，美帝国主义并不因此就接受教训改变它的侵略本性，相反的，美帝国主义还在变本加厉地推行它的侵略政策。前些日子，美国帝国主义竟然破坏了四国首脑会议，这再一次暴露了它狰狞的侵略面目，最近它更加紧扩军备战，策划进一步奴役各国人民。美帝国主义的头子——艾森豪威尔居然亲自钻到我国神圣的领土台湾，加紧制造“两个中国”，进一步策划新战争。艾森豪威尔这种强盗行为是对我国六亿五千万人民的公开挑衅，中国人民对此表示极大的愤怒。我们一定要解放我国神圣的领土台湾。
    我是一个转业军人，我曾经是一个抗美援朝的战士，我要警告美国帝国主义，警告艾森豪威尔，你的强盗军队是我们的手下败将！如果你忘了侵朝战争的沉重教训，胆敢发动新的侵略战争，我们全体转业军人，将重返前线再打你一个落花流水，彻底把侵略者从地球上消灭！
    让我们高呼：美帝国主义从我国的神圣领土台湾滚回去！从南朝鲜滚回去！从日本滚回去！从亚洲滚回去！
