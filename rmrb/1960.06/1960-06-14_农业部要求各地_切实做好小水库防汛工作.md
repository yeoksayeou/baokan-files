Xinhua News Agency, June 12th -- The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on June 10th regarding the implementation of flood prevention work for small reservoir projects.

The notice said that small reservoirs are numerous and widely distributed; they are connected to large and medium-sized backbone projects, forming a system that not only improves the efficiency of irrigation or power generation but also strengthens flood control capabilities. Therefore, flood prevention work for small reservoirs needs to be given high importance.

The notice requires all regions to do the following:

One, in the management and operation of reservoirs, it is necessary to both store water for drought prevention and to seize the opportunity to leave leeway for receiving and storing floodwaters. Any complacency that thinks the project is small and irrelevant, or that assumes there will be no problems with small reservoirs because of the protection of large and medium-sized projects, and thus does not actively study countermeasures, is wrong. Two, further improve inspection work. In particular, for projects that have not been tested by floods, the flood control capacity should be carefully verified and the quality of the project should be checked. Three, establish and improve mass flood prevention teams, assign responsibility for each project to specific individuals, and ensure that this is implemented. Four, improve communication and liaison work during the flood season, promptly report rainfall conditions, and ensure close contact between projects, villages, counties, and communes, so as to take the initiative.

    农业部要求各地
    切实做好小水库防汛工作
    据新华社12日讯　农业部在10日发出作好小型水库工程防汛工作的通知。
    通知说，小型水库数量多，分布面广；它与大、中型骨干工程连在一起，形成一个系统，不仅提高了灌溉或发电的效能，并且加强了防洪能力。因此，小型水库的防汛工作需要引起高度重视。
    通知要求各地做到以下几点：
    一、在水库的管理运用上，既要蓄水防旱，又要掌握时机，留有余地，准备接蓄洪水，任何认为工程小，无关紧要；或认为有了大、中型工程的防御，小型水库就不会有问题了，因而不积极研究对策的麻痹思想都是错误的。二、进一步做好检查工作。特别是未经过洪水考验的工程，应切实核算防洪能力，检查工程质量。三、建立和健全群众性防汛队伍，分片包干每一个工程，固定专人负责，落实到底。四、作好汛期通汛联络工作，及时通报雨情，作到工程、村镇、县、公社之间紧密联系，争取主动。
