Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th - Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company actively participate in the steel seizure and steel preservation joint technical performance competition, promoting the continuous rise of iron and steel production levels. Compared with the average daily output in May, the average daily output in early June increased by 5.5% for steel, 2.4% for pig iron, and 4.7% for artificial rich ore.
    In order to ensure that June becomes a high-yield month for iron and steel, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has established a steel seizure war headquarters headed by Yang Shijie, the first secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. Yuan Zhen, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and secretary of the Party Committee and manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, carried out a furnace protection key breakthrough performance competition with the steel workers in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, focusing on the three key areas of the front wall, water jacket, and furnace head, thereby shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel compared to the past.
    Steel workers, taking No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace as an example, launched a competition. The steel workers of the Second Steelmaking Plant put forward the slogan "Maintain the new furnace as an old furnace, and use the old furnace as a new furnace," and formed five shock teams for blowing water jackets, blowing furnace tops, and pasting front and rear walls, and launched a single-item key breakthrough performance, breaking through more than 200 key points of large and small furnace bodies in just five days. In early June, the average daily output of high-quality steel was more than 400 tons higher than in May.
    Tens of thousands of miners are fighting even harder to ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed, and the average daily output of artificial rich ore in early June increased by 4.7% compared with May.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th - Leading cadres at all levels of Wuhan's metallurgical system go deep into the front line of production, into workshops, and on-site, eating, living, and laboring with the broad masses of workers, setting off a new upsurge in iron and steel production. The city's steel output in the first seven days of June increased by 22% compared with the same period in May, and steel products increased by 47% compared with the same period in May; the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces increased by 3% compared with the same period in May, and the coke ratio decreased by 10%.
    The party and government leading cadres of the Metallurgical Bureau established five working groups, went to various factories, contracted areas, and helped various factories carry out their work. The main leading cadres of the party committees of the factories and companies under the bureau also adopted the method of division of labor and contracting, going to workshops and construction sites to participate in production and lead production, and solving key problems in production together with the workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th - Henan Province's daily pig iron production level from June 1st to 7th increased by 4% compared with the previous month.
    In order to turn June into a high-yield month for iron and steel, Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the First Secretaries of the Xinxiang, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou Municipal Committees of the Communist Party of China, as well as the Secretaries of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee and many county and municipal party committees, went deep into various key iron and steel plants, and together with the leading cadres of various plants, vigorously grasped the iron and steel overproduction movement.
    The technical transformation of small blast furnaces has also been further accelerated. At present, the reformed blast furnaces in the province account for about one-third of the total volume of blast furnaces in production, which has played a great role in increasing pig iron production. For example, after the small blast furnaces of the Xinxiang No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant were all transformed, the average utilization coefficient was often maintained above 2, the coke consumption per ton of iron was reduced to below one ton, and the pig iron qualification rate reached more than 90%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th - Leading cadres of Jiangsu Province went to the front line of iron and steel production, implementing the principle of "more varieties and more harvests," making the average daily output of pig iron in the first week of June increase sharply by 15% compared with the last ten days of May, and steel output also increased.
    Since May, party secretaries at all levels in Jiangsu have taken the lead, leading a large number of cadres to go deep into the furnace front, mobilizing the masses to vigorously tackle key production points, and promoting the rise in iron and steel output.
    In the battle for iron, various localities have focused on the furnace opening rate and tried every means to improve the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces. In the first week of June, the furnace volume opened in the province increased by 9% compared with the last ten days of May, and the average utilization coefficient increased by 16%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th - The workers on the steel, iron, and coal fronts in Jiangxi Province won a great victory in the first week of June, with a substantial increase in the main products such as pig iron, raw coal, ore, steel, and steel products. As of the 8th, the province's daily pig iron production level increased by 33% compared with the average daily production level in the last ten days of May, ore increased by about 20%, and the daily coal production increased by more than 2,000 tons to 6,864 tons compared with the average daily production in the last ten days of May, and the daily production level of steel and steel products also increased to varying degrees.
    Since entering June, the broad masses of workers on the steel, iron, and coal fronts in the province have launched a magnificent battle to seize high yields of iron and steel coal. Yongxin County, a red flag county for iron and steel, quickly built twelve new small blast furnaces of three to five cubic meters and put them into production, making the county break through the 120-ton mark for six consecutive days in early June, an increase of 20% compared with the average daily output in May. Leading cadres of Anyuan Coal Mine went to the front line to contract areas and break through weak links. The average daily output from the 1st to the 6th reached 5,520 tons, an increase of 41.6% compared with the average daily output in the last six days of May.

    各级领导干部深入车间深入现场
    鞍钢六月上旬生产水平不断上升
    河南江苏江西和武汉飞传六月第一周丰产捷报
    新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工，奋勇参加夺钢、保钢大联合技术表演赛，推动钢铁生产水平不断上升。6月上旬的平均日产量与5月份的平均日产量比较，钢增长5．5％，生铁增长2．4％，人造富矿增长4．7％。
    为了保证把6月变成钢铁丰产月，中共鞍山市委已成立了由市委第一书记杨士杰挂帅的夺钢大战总指挥部。市委书记兼鞍钢党委书记和经理袁振，在第一炼钢厂和炼钢工人一起冒着高温开展护炉攻关表演赛，大攻前墙、水套、炉头三大关键，从而使每炉钢熔炼时间比过去缩短。
    炼钢工人们以六号平炉为榜样，开展对手赛。第二炼钢厂炼钢工人提出“把新炉子当老炉子维护，把老炉子当新炉子使用”的口号，组成了吹水套、吹炉顶、贴前后墙等五个突击队，展开了单项重点攻关大表演，在短短五天中突破大小炉体关键二百多项，6月上旬，平均每天比5月份多生产四百多吨优质钢。
    几万名矿工为了保证高炉吃饱吃好，更是越战越酣，6月上旬人造富矿的平均日产量比5月提高4．7％。
    新华社武汉11日电　武汉市冶金系统各级领导干部深入生产第一线，下车间，下现场，同广大职工同吃同住同劳动，掀起钢铁生产新高潮。全市6月前七天钢产量比5月同期增长22％，钢材比5月同期增长47％；小高炉的利用系数比5月同期增长3％，焦比降低10％。
    冶金局党政领导干部共成立了五个工作组，下到各厂，分片包干，帮助各厂开展工作。局属各厂、公司党委主要领导干部也采取分工包干的办法，下车间、工地参加生产领导生产，同职工一起解决生产上的关键问题。
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省6月1日至7日的生铁日产水平比上月增长4％。
    为了把6月变为钢铁丰产月，中共河南省委书记处书记杨蔚屏，中共新乡地委、洛阳地委、中共郑州市委的第一书记，以及信阳地委和许多县委、市委书记，都深入各重点钢铁厂，与各厂领导干部一起大抓钢铁超产运动。
    小高炉的技术改造工作也进一步加速。目前全省已经改造好的高炉，约占正在生产的高炉总容积的三分之一，这对于提高生铁生产起了很大的作用。如新乡市第二钢铁厂的小高炉全部改造后，平均利用系数经常保持在二以上，每吨铁消耗的焦炭降低在一吨以下，生铁合格率达到90％以上。
    据新华社南京10日电　江苏省领导干部走上钢铁生产前线，贯彻“多种多收”，使6月第一周的生铁平均日产量比5月下旬猛增15％，钢的产量也有增长。
    5月以来，江苏各级党委书记挂帅，率领大批干部深入炉前，发动群众猛攻生产关键，促进了钢铁产量上升。
    在夺铁大战中，各地狠抓开炉率，并且千方百计提高高炉的利用系数。6月第一周，全省开炉容积比5月下旬增加了9％，利用系数平均提高了16％。
    据新华社南昌10日电　江西省钢、铁、煤战线上的职工，6月第一周赢得了生铁、原煤、矿石以及钢和钢材等主要产品大幅度增长的巨大胜利。至8日止，全省生铁日产水平较5月下旬平均日产水平增长33％，矿石增长20％左右，煤炭日产量比5月下旬平均日产量增长两千多吨到六千八百六十四吨，钢和钢材的日产水平也都有不同程度的增长。
    进入6月份以来，全省钢、铁、煤战线的广大职工开展了波澜壮阔的夺取钢铁煤高产的大会战。钢铁红旗县——永新县，很快新建了十二座三到五立方米的小高炉，投入生产，使全县6月上旬连续六天突破一百二十吨大关，比5月平均日产量增加了20％。安源煤矿领导干部亲临前线分片包干，突破薄弱环节，1到6日平均日产达到五千五百二十吨，比5月最后六天平均日产提高了41．6％。
