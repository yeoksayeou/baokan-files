Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 17th: Teachers and students of the Shanghai Higher Institute of Technology have greatly promoted the school's teaching reform by participating in the technical revolution and have begun to explore an effective way to reform engineering education.

This year, after the technical innovation and technical revolution movements were launched on the industrial front, the degree of mechanization and automation in many production departments has significantly improved, and a large number of new technologies and new processes have emerged, causing a series of major changes in production. As a higher institute of technology that trains senior technical cadres for industrial construction, how to keep up with these changes in teaching has become an urgent task. When the technical revolution movement was just launched, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China foresaw this and promptly organized teachers and students from various higher institutes of technology to participate in the torrent of the technical revolution. Schools quickly saw an unprecedented surge of going down to the factories. So far, more than 10,000 teachers and students from four engineering universities and colleges, including Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Chemical Engineering College, and Textile College, have participated in the technical revolution, producing more than 7,700 innovations, nearly 600 of which are major.

The storm of the technical revolution has not only changed the backwardness of production technology but also impacted bourgeois educational thought and many old frameworks. People have a clearer understanding of many fundamental problems in the original teaching. After the teachers and students of the Shipbuilding Department of Jiaotong University went to the factory to participate in the construction of ships, they generally felt that much of what they had learned was useless, and what they needed was not taught. Many processes and technologies in the factory were new, but the professional teaching still spent a lot of time teaching outdated old technologies. After the teachers and students of the Chemical Engineering College participated in the technical revolution, they saw the new situation of the entire chemical industry and felt that some courses in the chemical engineering major also had to be reformed. Similar situations exist in almost all majors in engineering colleges. In the technical revolution, many majors have found the fundamental problems that their majors need to solve, which is the key to teaching reform.

After grasping the contradictions and clarifying the direction, a movement to thoroughly reform engineering education, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has vigorously unfolded. While participating in the technical revolution, schools are conducting extensive investigations and research, and on this basis, they are compiling textbooks and outlines for professional courses and formulating innovation plans. The most important characteristic of the textbooks that schools are currently compiling or have already compiled is that they are closely linked to China's production practices. In the past, when talking about the modernization of courses, people mostly focused on foreign technologies and theories. Now, they are summarizing the creations in China's production practices in a timely manner, raising them to the level of theory, and supplementing them into textbooks, which has become a very important aspect of course modernization. The textbooks compiled in this way have a greater guiding role for production. Through participating in the technical revolution, teachers and students have also made the three aspects of school teaching, scientific research, and productive labor more closely integrated.

At present, the teaching reform of Shanghai's engineering colleges is in full swing. In addition to strengthening basic theory courses, each school has initially formulated a set of professional reform plans and compiled 350 outlines and 86 textbooks. Each school has included participation in the technical revolution in the teaching plan. Certain fundamental reforms have emerged in the teaching system and teaching content, and teaching is being organized in light of the actual development of production and technology in China.

    参加技术革命推进教学改革
    上海高等工科学校摸索出一条有效的改革教学途径
    据新华社上海17日电　上海高等工科学校师生通过参加技术革命大大推动了学校的教学改革，并且开始摸索到了一条有效的改革工科教学的途径。
    今年工业战线上技术革新、技术革命运动展开后，许多生产部门机械化、自动化程度显著提高，还出现了大量的新工艺、新技术，引起了生产上的一系列重大变化。作为培养工业建设高级技术干部的高等工科学校，在教学上如何跟上去，就成了一个迫切的任务。中共上海市委在技术革命运动刚掀起时，就预见到这点，及时组织各高等工科学校的师生投身到技术革命的洪流中去。各校迅速出现了一个空前的下厂高潮。到目前为止，交通大学、同济大学、化工学院、纺织学院等四所工科高等学校已有一万多师生参加了技术革命，搞出了革新七千七百多项，其中重大的近六百项。
    技术革命的风暴不仅改变了生产技术上的落后面貌，也冲击了资产阶级教育思想和许多旧框框，人们对原来教学中存在的许多根本问题看得更加清楚了。交通大学船舶制造系师生下厂参加建造轮船的工作后，普遍感到许多学过的用不上，要用的没有学，工厂里许多工艺、技术都是新的，但专业教学中还花很大篇幅去讲授早已不用的旧技术。化工学院的师生参加技术革命后，看到了整个化工工业的新局面，觉得化工专业的一些课程同样必须进行改革。类似的情况，差不多在工科院校的所有专业中都存在。许多专业在技术革命中摸到了自己专业需要解决的根本问题，也就是教学改革的纲。
    在抓住矛盾，明确方向以后，一个高举毛泽东思想红旗、彻底革新工科教学的运动就蓬勃地开展起来。各校都在参加技术革命的同时，广泛进行调查研究，在这个基础上编写专业课程的教材、大纲，制订革新方案。各校正在编写或已经编成的教材，最大特点就是联系我国的生产实际。过去谈到课程现代化，多从外国的技术、理论着眼，现在都及时地总结我国生产实际中的创造，提到理论高度，补充到教材中去，成为课程现代化的一个很重要的方面。这样编成的教材，对生产的指导作用也就更大。师生们通过参加技术革命，也使学校教学、科学研究和生产劳动三者更加紧密地结合起来。
    现在上海工科高等学校教学改革正方兴未艾，各校除加强基础理论课之外，已初步订出了一套专业改革的方案，并编出三百五十部大纲和八十六本教材。各校都把参加技术革命列入了教学计划。在教学体系、教学内容上已出现了某些具有根本意义的改革，开始联系我国生产和技术科学发展的实际，组织教学。
