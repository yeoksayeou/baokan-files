Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 20th: People from all walks of life in Shanghai have recently issued statements or held gatherings, resolutely supporting the anti-American armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops.

    Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, stated: The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army's shelling of the "God of Plague" fully expresses the firm will and determination of the Chinese people to oppose American imperialism. We must unite with all the people in Asia and the world who oppose imperialism, resolutely fight American imperialism to the end, and tighten the noose around the neck of American imperialism. Li Qitao, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: American imperialism owes the Chinese people many blood debts, and every debt must be repaid. Guo Jian, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation, said that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the American army must get out of the Taiwan area. Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said that the "God of Plague" Eisenhower went to Taiwan, our territory, to continue to create the "two Chinas" conspiracy, maintain its aggressive base in Asia, and expand the threat to peace in the Far East. We believe that relying on the resolute struggle of the broad masses of the people, we will surely be able to crush the American imperialist aggression and war conspiracy and defend world peace.

    Advanced producers and veteran workers in Shanghai held a meeting on the 18th. Han Xinliang, a national advanced producer and engineer from the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, said: When we heard the news of the shelling of the "God of Plague," we all cheered that it was a good hit, a satisfying hit. He said that for such an aggressive ringleader, only artillery shells could be used to "welcome" him. Zhou Ronghua and Bu Zhanxi, Shanghai railway workers who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, pointed out that the Chinese people, who won a glorious victory on the Korean battlefield, know how to deal with aggressors. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Shanghai Municipal Youth Federation, and the Shanghai Municipal Student Federation also jointly held a meeting. Hao Jianxiu, a nationally renowned textile worker studying at the East China Textile Engineering Institute, pointed out at the meeting that the Chinese people will never forgive the aggressors. Professors from Fudan University also held a meeting. President Chen Wangdao said at the meeting that the sound of artillery from the Fujian Front driving away the "God of Plague" expressed the voice of the Chinese people's firm opposition to American imperialism and support for the anti-American and patriotic just struggle of the people of Asian countries and compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu.

    Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Shanghai held a gathering on the 19th. Huang Qinshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said at the meeting: Eisenhower's robber trip to the Far East is like adding fuel to the fire, which will burn him to a crisp.

    Some famous figures in Shanghai's cultural circles have also issued statements in the past few days supporting the anti-American armed demonstration by the Fujian Front troops. Writer Ba Jin said: Eisenhower's robber trip has tightened the noose around his own neck. American imperialism will one day be strangled to death by this noose.

    We Will Never Give Up Until We Drive the American Robbers Out of Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 20th: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the Chongqing Municipal Organizations of various democratic parties, and various people's organizations held gatherings in the afternoon of the 19th to severely condemn the chief war criminal Eisenhower's conspiracy to plan new wars in Asia, and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army's shelling to "welcome" and "see off" the "God of Plague."

    At the joint meeting held by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and the Chongqing Municipal Organizations of various democratic parties, Xia Zhongshi, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and Pei Changhui, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the RCCK, unanimously pointed out in their speeches: The chief war criminal of American imperialism, Eisenhower, came to Asia for a robber trip, which is a provocation to the great Chinese people and the Asian people. The People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops used powerful artillery fire to "welcome" him, expressing the will and determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. Xia Zhongshi and Pei Changhui also warned the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan at the meeting to properly recognize the current international situation, recognize the future, break away from the situation of living under the eaves of others, unite, and wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism. Xiao Huaqing, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Robbers can't do good deeds when they go out. We express our utmost indignation at the heinous activities of the chief war criminal of American imperialism, Eisenhower, in planning wars in the Far East.

    At the meeting held by the heads of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, various industrial trade unions, and representatives of advanced producers from ten systems including steel, machinery, coal mining, and electricity, Ding Changhe, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, represented more than 600,000 workers in the city in expressing resolute support for the People's Liberation Army's shelling of Jinmen to hold anti-American armed demonstrations, and firmly fighting American imperialism's shameless aggression and military provocations against our country to the end. He said: The chief war criminal, the head of American imperialism, Eisenhower, came to the Far East to plot a war conspiracy, which will never succeed.

    The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Municipal Youth Federation jointly held a symposium, and the Chongqing Municipal Women's Federation also held a meeting. The participants expressed their firm support for the anti-American armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops, and their determination to fight together with the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan and drive away the American aggressors.

    Resolutely Fight American Imperialism to the End
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 20th: People from all walks of life in Harbin have held gatherings for several days in succession, resolutely supporting the anti-American armed demonstrations held by the People's Liberation Army in shelling Jinmen, and resolutely supporting the struggle of compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu and the people of Asia against Eisenhower's robber trip.

    Wei Shuqin, a representative attending the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education, a salesperson from the Nangang No. 7 Department Store in Harbin, and an advanced figure in the theory of workers, peasants, and students nationwide, said in her speech that the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops used shelling to "welcome" the war criminal Eisenhower, expressing our intentions, and we resolutely support it. If American imperialism does not get out of Taiwan, we will resolutely fight it to the end. Ma Chizong, a representative attending the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education and an engineer from the Harbin Institute of Technology affiliated factory who came from a worker's background, said that Eisenhower is the number one war criminal in the world. He came from the east coast of the Pacific Ocean to the western Pacific to plan aggression and war conspiracies, openly provoking the great Chinese people. We resolutely support the Fujian Front troops in holding armed demonstrations against American imperialism and against Eisenhower. Su Guangming, an engineer from the Harbin Vehicle Factory who came from a worker's background and a national labor model, said: The Asian people are not to be trifled with. The Japanese people gave the "God of Plague" Eisenhower the cold shoulder, and we Chinese people used artillery to "welcome" this "God of Plague." This made American imperialism once again reveal its paper tiger form in front of the people of the world, and will further encourage the people of Asia and the world to fight it to the end with confidence. Fan Zhaobao, the instructor of the Second Militia Company of the Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3 Branch, said that he represented the entire company of militiamen in expressing their willingness to heighten their vigilance, practice military skills well, and be ready at all times to deal a head-on blow to the American aggressors who are planning new war conspiracies.

    The Chinese People Know What Way to Teach the Enemy
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 20th: Responsible persons from local organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City, as well as people from all walks of life, held a gathering on the morning of the 19th to angrily condemn the robber trip of the number one war criminal Eisenhower, and resolutely support the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops.

    Yang Zixiu, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the RCCK, said at the meeting: Eisenhower's trip to the Far East was full of gunpowder, and he was strongly opposed by the people wherever he went. He said that Taiwan is an inalienable part of our country's sacred territory, and liberating Taiwan is the sacred task of our people. Our people must liberate Taiwan, and American imperialism must get out of Taiwan. Feng Sutao, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Eisenhower came to our territory Taiwan for a robber trip and was shelled by the People's Liberation Army on our Fujian Front. This artillery fire expressed the contempt and disdain of the 650 million people of China for American imperialism, and was a powerful support for the anti-American just struggle of the Asian people. We will severely teach this war criminal and resolutely fight back against his provocations. Wang Mengling, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, expressed her firm support for the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops' head-on blow to Eisenhower, the "God of Plague." Zhang Yu, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: The People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops' artillery shelling to "welcome" and "see off" the "God of Plague" Eisenhower fully expresses the strong will and determination of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country to oppose American imperialism. Wang Liang, member of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Youth Federation, said that after the news of the Fujian Front troops using artillery shelling to "welcome" the "God of Plague" came, the youth of the entire province applauded. He said that we Chinese people know best what way to teach the enemy. The youth of the whole province are determined to unite with the people of Asia and the world to carry out unremitting struggles against American imperialist aggression.

    We Must Liberate Taiwan and Rescue Our Compatriots in Dire Straits
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 19th: People from all walks of life in Fujian Province on the coastal defense front enthusiastically support the letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu issued by the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, resolutely oppose the American imperialist aggression, and angrily protest the war criminal Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan.

    Workers in Fuzhou factories gathered in workshops to protest Eisenhower's robber trip. Chen Yiduan, a Fuzhou industrial labor model, a worker at the Fuzhou No. 6 Machine Factory, and a militia captain, said that the war criminal Eisenhower's "visit to Taiwan" is ill-intentioned. We will never allow the U.S. imperialism to create the "two Chinas" conspiracy. Our workers are determined to support the anti-American armed demonstration with practical actions to improve steel production.

    Lin Qiguang, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Women's Federation, said that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East this time is to further strengthen war preparations and attempt to permanently occupy our country's territory of Taiwan. We express our strong protest. We must liberate Taiwan, rescue our Taiwanese compatriots who are in dire straits, rescue the women and children of Taiwan, and drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.

    More than 1,700 students from Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School gathered early in the morning to angrily protest the "visit" to Taiwan by the head of American imperialism, Eisenhower.

    Lin Zhuguang, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that we used artillery fire to "welcome" the God of Plague Eisenhower, which made the returned overseas Chinese and their families in the entire province feel extremely excited. Many of our overseas Chinese are directly persecuted by U.S. imperialism. Chen Shousheng, Standing Committee member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the RCCK, Chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee, and Vice Chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal CPPCC, said that we warmly support the anti-American armed demonstrations on the Jinmen Front. All patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu who are unwilling to succumb to the pressure of U.S. imperialism should unite under the banner of patriotism and expel U.S. imperialism from Taiwan.

    Enhance the People's Morale and Diminish the Enemy's Prestige
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 20th: People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province have gathered for several days to angrily condemn the "God of Plague" Eisenhower for climbing onto our territory of Taiwan and launching war provocations against our country.

    The representatives attending the Third Session of the Second Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress held gatherings on the 18th. Ye Jisheng, a representative of the Provincial People's Congress and a veteran worker from the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory, said at the meeting that the People's Liberation Army used artillery shelling to "welcome" and "see off" the "God of Plague," and it was a good shelling. This expresses the contempt and disdain of the 650 million people of China for the head of American imperialism, Eisenhower.

    At the meeting held by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC on the 19th, Li Shizhang, a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the RCCK, said that the bandit chief Eisenhower went to the Far East to carry out conspiracies after he single-handedly sabotaged the four-nation government summit. He climbed onto our territory of Taiwan to provoke the great Chinese people. The People's Liberation Army bombarded him with artillery, which enhanced the morale of the people and diminished the prestige of the enemy. Liu Zhigang, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the RCCK, said that Taiwan is our country's sacred and inviolable territory. American imperialism has occupied Taiwan for ten years and turned Taiwan into a hell on earth. We hope that all patriotic Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan will quickly wake up, abandon the dark and turn to the light, and join the people of the entire country in driving American imperialism out of Taiwan. Responsible persons from the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Jiangxi Provincial Women's Federation also made statements one after another, exposing Eisenhower's conspiracy in his trip to the Far East, condemning American imperialism for provoking us, and unanimously expressing their determination to fight American imperialism to the end.

    We Will Definitely Give the Provocateurs a Double Response
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 20th: The American bandit chief Eisenhower's conspiracy activities in coming to our territory of Taiwan to plot aggression and create "two Chinas" have angered the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Qinghai Province and Xining City. In recent days, people have held gatherings or issued statements, expressing their firm support for the great anti-American armed demonstration of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front in shelling Jinmen, and their firm support for the anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the people of Asian countries.

    Wang Dingbang, Acting Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said in a statement, "The crime of the "God of Plague" Eisenhower in coming to our territory of Taiwan to plot aggression is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must drive American imperialism out of Taiwan. We will never give up until we win a complete victory." Zhao Ximin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, said in a statement: "The so-called 'visit' to Taiwan by the American bandit chief Eisenhower is another serious provocation against our people. The youth of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front in using artillery shelling to 'welcome' this war 'God of Plague.'" Hong Guangyuan, Deputy Director of the Qinghai Provincial Women's Federation, said in a statement: "Eisenhower, disregarding the resolute opposition of the people of all countries, insisted on his robber trip to the Far East. This further exposed the ugly face of American imperialism, which interferes in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, plots new wars of aggression, and insists on being an enemy of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world, and will inevitably lead to a greater upsurge in the anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the people of all countries."

    Many workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, students, and residents have held gatherings in recent days. They have severely condemned the United States for invading our territory of Taiwan and resolutely supported the armed anti-American demonstration of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front.

    Give the Warmongers a Good Lesson
    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The war "God of Plague" Eisenhower's bandit activities in Taiwan have angered the broad masses of militiamen in the capital. After hearing the news on the 17th that the militiamen on the Fujian Front cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in shelling Jinmen, the various militia divisions unanimously cheered, "Well done!" On the 18th and 19th, many militia divisions and regiments turned out one after another and gathered in the spirit of the armed demonstration of the soldiers and civilians on the front line to demonstrate, and angrily lodged a serious protest against the "God of Plague" Eisenhower's blatant trampling on our territory of Taiwan.

    Guo Qingzeng, Deputy Platoon Leader of the Militia Regiment of the Beijing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, said at the meeting: "Eisenhower, who is full of germs, has gone from the East Pacific to the West Pacific for the purpose of plotting wars of aggression and maintaining his colonial rule. Since this war criminal continues to run into walls everywhere and refuses to turn back, let the Chinese and Asian people who have stood up give him a good lesson!" Zhao Guanqun, a backbone militiaman, wrote a poem on the spot with righteous indignation: "Eisenhower's trip is ill-intentioned, he runs into walls wherever he goes, the 600 million people, how can we let you bully us, we 'welcome' you with cannons, we 'send' you off with cannons!" The militia division of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company condemned Eisenhower in meetings organized by platoons and squads. Lang Huai, a militiaman from the Iron Smelting Workshop, said: "Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan is like 'a weasel visiting a chicken,' he has no good intentions at all. The People's Liberation Army's artillery shelling to 'welcome' and 'see off' him has vented my full stomach of anger!" The Hebei Normal School Militia Division was filled with excitement. When some militia regiments were reading the proclamation of the headquarters of the Fujian Front, everyone couldn't help shouting: "Fire the cannons! Eisenhower get out!" (Attached picture)

    青海省总工会代主席王定邦发表谈话说，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到我国领土台湾策划侵略的罪恶活动，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民一定要把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，不获全胜，决不罢休。共青团青海省委常委赵喜民发表谈话说：美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔对台湾进行的所谓“访问”，是对我国人民的又一次严重挑衅。青海省各族青年和全国人民一起，坚决支持福建前线人民解放军用炮轰“迎送”这个战争“瘟神”。青海省妇联副主任洪光远发表谈话说：艾森豪威尔不顾各国人民的坚决反对，坚持他的远东的强盗旅行，这进一步暴露了美帝国主义到处干涉别国内政，策划新的侵略战争，坚持与中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民为敌的强盗嘴脸，必然要引起各国人民反美爱国正义斗争的更大兴起。
    许多工人、农民、战士、干部、学生、居民，连日来纷纷举行了集会。严厉斥责美国侵略我国领土台湾，坚决支持福建前线人民解放军的武装反美大示威。
    狠狠地教训一下战争贩子
    据新华社20日讯　战争“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到台湾进行强盗活动，激怒了首都广大民兵。各民兵师在听到17日福建前线民兵配合解放军炮轰金门的消息后，一致欢呼“打得好！”18、19两日，许多民兵师团纷纷出动，以前线军民武装大示威的精神集会示威，对“瘟神”艾森豪威尔明目张胆地践踏我国的领土台湾，愤怒地提出严重抗议。
    北京市染织厂民兵团副排长郭庆增在会上说：“满身毒菌的艾森豪威尔，从东太平洋走到西太平洋，目的就是策划侵略战争，维护他的殖民统治。这个战争贩子既然到处碰壁还是死不回头，那么就让站起来了的中国人民和亚洲人民狠狠地教训他一顿吧！”基干民兵赵冠群义愤填胸地当场作诗一首：“艾克旅行，不怀好意，走到那里，那里碰壁，六亿人民，岂容你欺，大炮‘迎’你，大炮‘送’你！”石景山钢铁公司民兵师，以班、排为单位集会谴责艾森豪威尔。炼铁车间的民兵郎怀礼说：“艾森豪威尔到台湾是‘黄鼠狼给鸡拜年’，根本不怀好心，解放军开炮‘迎送’他，给我出了满肚子气！”河北师范民兵师，群情激昂，有的民兵团在宣读福建前线司令部文告的时候，大家情不自禁地喊道：“开——炮！艾森豪威尔滚回去！”（附图片）
