Great Leap Forward in Production, Culture Takes Wing
Representative of Siji People's Commune, Chaoxian County, Anhui Province: Tang Jianjun

We, the members of the Siji People's Commune in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, love to compose and sing folk songs the most. People elsewhere call our place the land of poetry. Someone once used this folk song to encourage us:

    Poems and paintings cover the walls, songs are sung continuously,
    Everyone studies and reads,
    Breaking through the cultural barrier in one fell swoop,
    Writers and poets are seen in the fields.

Actually, there are no writers or poets there; we are all peasants, farmers. It's just that in the Mao Zedong era, the working people seized the handle of power, and were neither oppressed nor exploited, so they felt comfortable and naturally wanted to sing. As early as the advanced cooperative stage, Shu Shouxian, who was sixty-eight years old in the joint production brigade, sang a folk song:

    I'm like Zhang Guolao standing on a cloud,
    With white beard, I come to sing,
    If someone asks me why,
    Life is getting happier and happier.

This folk song reveals the secret of why the Siji Commune loves to sing folk songs.

However, it was only after the Great Leap Forward that we sang more and louder, and used various forms of art to express our new life.

In 1958, the Party's general line for building socialism emitted a brilliant light, illuminating everyone's heart. Everyone was full of energy, striving to be the best, and the hot and exciting socialist construction inspired everyone's creative enthusiasm. At this time, the Party called for a cultural revolution, and Chairman Mao advocated collecting new folk songs. All of our commune members were really happy and encouraged, everywhere "looking for willows" and "singing impromptu," resulting in a folk song creation movement of thousands of composers and tens of thousands of singers. A large number of peasant singers emerged in all aspects, and some families participated in singing together. Wan Bangcai, a member of the Fangji Brigade, and his entire family of eleven all happily sang. His son was the director of the team's club, Wan Bangcai participated in the Huang Zhong Chorus, his wife Xia Faying participated in the Grandma Dance Troupe, his daughter-in-law participated in the March 8th Chorus, and his grandchildren participated in the Children's Dance Troupe. Sometimes the whole family would form a chorus and perform on stage. In short, in the Siji Commune, young people sang, old people sang, men sang, women sang, they sang at home, they sang while working in the fields, dozens of people or hundreds of people would sing in a chorus, a few people would sing in a small chorus, two people would sing in a duet, and one person would sing a solo. Composing folk songs and singing folk songs, everyone simply became "song fans." Commune member Xu Liangying sang while transplanting rice seedlings:

    There is no singing in the rice planting field,
    Planting is slow and tiring,
    Clear your throat and sing a song,
    In the blink of an eye, the field is all green.

For the members of our commune, singing folk songs has such a great use. It can replace rest. Singing folk songs while working can add strength.

Combining folk songs with big-character posters to criticize those who are ideologically backward and lazy in production is truly awe-inspiring. There was a woman in our area who was gluttonous and lazy, nicknamed "Lazy Leech." The neighbors persuaded her to help her, but she never changed. Later, she was awakened and educated by a folk song posted in her home's hall. The folk song was written like this:

    There is a lazy leech in our team,
    Doesn't get out of bed until late morning,
    Afraid of dew in the morning, afraid of the sun at noon,
    Everyone is making a breakthrough in production,
    She stays at home holding her baby,
    If you want to mobilize her to work,
    She raises her nose and doesn't answer,
    After much persuasion, she opens her mouth,
    Rolls her eyes and pretends:
    "My little treasure needs to be taken care of,
    Who will take responsibility if something goes wrong?",
    It's clear the baby is being taken care of,
    Lying and loafing is too absurd,
    If you insist on not correcting,
    Folk songs will be sung everywhere immediately.

Folk songs can be composed and sung at any time, and can sing about the real life of the commune at any time, singing out the love of the members for the Party and the leaders. The great victories of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune made everyone more deeply aware of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Our commune members love to sing this folk song that they composed themselves:

    The Yangtze River flows endlessly,
    Singing folk songs, the mouth is hard to stop,
    Thousands of sentences into one sentence,
    One sentence sings into the heart:
    Happiness is all thanks to Chairman Mao,
    May he have much happiness and longevity.

Everyone composes and sings, singing about what they are doing, singing out the heroic spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, overcoming difficulties, and conquering nature. In the fight against drought, the commune members split the mountains and led the water of Chaohu Lake over the hills, which was unimaginable before communization, but now they have split the mountains and diverted water with their own hands, which has educated the broad masses of commune members to realize that man can conquer nature. The commune members used thousands of moving anti-drought poems to express their fighting spirit and determination. For example:

    Commune members are all heroes,
    Dare to think, dare to say, and dare to do,
    Move the lake water to the top of Huangshan,
    The earth will have to follow my lead.

Gao Wenhua, who had just gotten rid of illiteracy, sang an anti-drought folk song that was said to be revolutionary romanticism. He sang:

    The Milky Way in the sky is thousands of miles long,
    Cowherd and Weaver Girl are on opposite sides,
    Now drain the water of the Milky Way,
    Men will farm and women will weave forever.

The term romanticism is not familiar to farmers, but our folk singers in that area always like to exaggerate, use metaphors, and describe static things as living things when composing and singing folk songs, and they always want to write their ideals into the new folk songs. For example, to achieve agricultural harvest, there are many conditions, and fertilizer accumulation is an important one. The principle is very obvious, and the matter is also very ordinary. But our singers sang about the accumulation of fertilizer vividly. A fertilizer accumulation folk song sings:

    Fertile mud piles are piled up in every village,
    Piling up a lazy dragon to the sky,
    When encountering a commune member shouting,
    The lazy dragon rolls down into the field in fright,
    The lazy dragon shakes its body and turns into a fierce change,
    Turning into crops that pierce the sky,
    Grain is piled up like mountains in autumn harvest,
    The lazy dragon pile returns to its original state.

After communization, women were particularly happy. The commune set up canteens and kindergartens, and women were freed from the shackles of household labor. After work, they had more time to participate in singing activities. Sun Yezhen of the Wuyue Production Brigade had a natural good voice and loved to dance and sing. Before communization, once, in order to welcome visiting guests from afar, the township held a gala, and she had a performance program, but she was entangled in heavy housework and could not get away. By the time the meal was cooked and the children were put to sleep, the gala was over. She was blamed by everyone, saying that she delayed the performance, which made her feel very wronged. After the establishment of the commune, her family ate in the canteen, and the two children were sent to the nursery, so she was freed from household labor. She was not only a production expert, but also an active member of cultural activities. In 1959, she went to Beijing to participate in the song and dance performance observation of eight provinces and cities. She couldn't help but compose the following folk song:

    Women have turned over now,
    No need to ask about three meals a day,
    Show their skills on the production front,
    Singing and dancing all the way to Beijing.

Young women sang, and old women also sang. Grandma Wang Changying, who was seventy-eight years old, sang:

    Don't laugh at my teeth not closing tightly,
    I insist on singing The East is Red,
    Thousands of sentences into one sentence,
    Thanking the leader Chairman Mao.

I have cited so many folk songs created by the commune members, but it is only to show that people in our area like to sing. In fact, our commune's singing movement is still not enough compared with other places. Taking Zongyang County in our Anhui Province as an example, they have composed and sung many good folk songs there. The folk song they created, such as "The rice piles are piled round, the commune members pile the rice to the sky, tear a piece of white cloud to wipe sweat, and take a puff of cigarette facing the sun," is the one we love to sing the most, so in addition to our own creations, we also like to sing good folk songs from other provinces and counties to enrich our cultural life. We know that liking to sing is only one aspect of cultural life. Like the working people of the whole country, our hobbies are also diverse. The Party encourages us to say that once the laborers grasp their own destiny and become the masters of culture, they will inevitably grasp cultural knowledge from all aspects and create our own culture of the working people from all aspects. In addition to singing, our commune has an amateur cultural troupe, a large theater, and thirty-five amateur cultural teams in the production teams. The commune also has seven central clubs, a film projection team, and thirty-five slide projection stations. The commune also has a cultural center, a library, and an exhibition hall. Each production brigade also has a library, a science and technology lecture hall, and a technical research group. Primary school education has been popularized, and illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been eliminated. Currently, there are four agricultural middle schools and one ordinary middle school. In the second half of last year, the commune also established a Federation of Literary and Art Circles, under which there are 267 creation groups. The commune runs two types of lithographic and mimeographed newspapers, a wired broadcasting station, fifty propaganda teams, and sixty-seven newspaper reading groups. Other things such as field soil broadcasting, production mobilization signs, Leap Forward propaganda workshops, and blackboards are everywhere. Sports activities are also more active, with thirty-five basketball teams, and some brigades also have women's basketball teams. In terms of health care, there is one hospital and seven maternity hospitals. These cultural organizations and the various cultural activities carried out around these organizations have made the entire commune begin to form a situation of cultural popularization. People describe this situation as "the Great Leap Forward in production, culture takes wing." Since the Great Leap Forward, the whole commune has created 1,030,000 folk songs, painted more than 2,800 large murals, written more than 270 scripts, quyi, and novels, eleven folk music ensembles, created eleven dances, 143 dance tunes and songs, and excavated and sorted out 386 folk songs with sheet music. There were 657 folk songs and folk music published in national and provincial newspapers and periodicals. The provincial film studio also filmed the "Siji New Year" film about the production and cultural activities of the commune members. It needs to be pointed out here that in the autumn of 1958, the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Musicians Association held a national on-site meeting on the socialist singing movement in our commune, which gave us many valuable instructions and learned the advanced experience of fraternal provinces and regions, which was a great encouragement and a great impetus to the cultural activities there.

Our cultural activities resolutely implemented the policy of serving proletarian politics and serving socialist construction. In June 1959, when cotton in the commune was infested with pests, the cultural organizations of each brigade made pest control technology signs in the form of poetry and paintings and inserted them into the fields. The commune members learned pest control methods by looking at the paintings and singing songs, and all 8,000 acres of affected cotton were cured in three days.

During last year's autumn plowing and autumn planting, all production teams carried out a lively labor competition. At that time, there was a lot of farm work and a tight labor force, and everyone wanted to be the first to complete the task. Teams with too tight farm work did not get the support they deserved, so the amateur cultural troupe arranged a play advocating communist collaboration and toured to perform in various teams. After watching this play, the Huji and Shanggong Production Teams immediately organized mutual support. The Huji Production Team supported the Shanggong Production Team with wheat seeds and cattle, and the Shanggong Team immediately sent four full labor forces to help the Huji Team rush to harvest late rice.

The commune's exhibition hall played a significant role in the mass campaign for tool reform. Jiang Daofa's enthusiasm and drive increased after seeing his imitation cotton strip seeder displayed in the exhibition hall. In more than ten days, he successively trial-produced seven new agricultural tools, such as fertilizer transport pulley and rice transplanter finger rowers. After seeing it, the commune members also started to create new tools, and the technical revolution was immediately promoted in the commune. The long-term plan for the commune displayed in the exhibition hall gave every commune member great encouragement. One team in Fangji used to have poor production. After the commune members saw the long-term plan, their production enthusiasm was even greater, and the attendance rate reached full attendance. Seeing that the ideals of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification were gradually being realized, they sang with joy:

    "Plowing the land with iron cattle, reaching the end in the blink of an eye,
    Sowing a piece of rice field, black and oily in an instant,
    The old cow nods and smiles, saying that I am behind,
    Apply to the commune to transfer to be a dairy cow."

In 1959, rich peasant elements of the Wuyue Brigade conspired to disintegrate the canteen and sabotage the People's Commune. Under the instruction of the Party branch, the club immediately wrote and performed a play called "The Canteen is Good." After the masses watched it, they were deeply educated. Lou Liangfa, a member of the Xilou Village, wrote a poem and exposed the conspiracy of the rich peasant element Wang Qinghua on the spot. He angrily sang:

    Rich peasant element Wang Qinghua,
    Blind eyes, deflated mouth,
    Outwardly a smiling tiger,
    A sword hidden in the liver,
    Inciting the masses to disband the canteen,
    Sabotaging the commune with a vicious heart,
    Now take out the demon mirror,
    See where you bad egg is hiding.

Due to the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members and the cultural work serving politics and production, we have been working hard to achieve a continuous leap forward in production. In 1958, we achieved a great harvest in the entire commune and gloriously attended the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural and Socialist Construction at the end of 1958. We received awards from the State Council. In 1959, we overcame the severe drought between summer and autumn and won a greater harvest than in 1958. Compared with 1958, the yield per unit area of ​​grain increased by 47.7% and cotton increased by 59.6%. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline fisheries, and commune-run industries have also achieved comprehensive development. The average income of commune members increased by 52.6%. Awarded the "Production Excellence" red flag by the Anhui Provincial People's Committee.

Due to the Great Leap Forward in production and the Great Leap Forward in culture, everyone is even more energetic, full of joy, and in a happy mood. In work, politics is always in command and propaganda comes first; in production, we are vigorous and full of energy, and as soon as there is a task, the broadcasting horn sounds, if we need to produce, we immediately go to work; if we need to attend a meeting, everyone arrives at the venue. Usually, the cultural center, library, and exhibition hall are the places commune members love to go to the most. In the village, at intersections, in the fields, and on the ridges, there are soil broadcasts, Leap Forward workshops, Leap Forward gates, and mobilization signs. All of these have become good teachers and helpful friends for the broad masses of commune members, and everyone learns political current affairs and scientific and technological knowledge from them. Big-character posters are even more lively and powerful. In September 1958, a comrade left this poem after participating in a field meeting there:

    Entering Siji, the atmosphere is new,
    Liberation of thought inspires people,
    Sowing the seeds of cultural revolution,
    Leap Forward flowers bloom for ten thousand years.

    Murals are full of walls, poetry is high,
    Songs are everywhere, the red flag flutters,
    The seedlings are painted green and strong,
    The mountains and earth are shaken by singing.

    Leap Forward gates and Leap Forward looks,
    The Leap Forward horn is blown everywhere,
    Leap Forward township, Leap Forward people,
    Competing for heroes in the Leap Forward.

This is too high of praise for our work. If we have achieved success in cultural popularization, it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the result of the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committees and the enthusiastic efforts of the broad masses of commune members. We know that the achievements we have made are still far from the requirements of the cultural revolution. We must continue to work hard, with the spirit of continuous revolution, and always forge ahead along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, holding high the three red banners, and striving to continue to achieve the Great Leap Forward in production and the Great Leap Forward in culture.

    生产大跃进　文化插翅飞
    安徽省巢县司集人民公社代表　唐健军
    我们安徽省巢县司集人民公社社员，最喜欢编民歌、唱民歌。别处的人，都叫我们那儿是诗歌之乡。有人曾用这样一首民歌来鼓励我们：
    诗画满墙歌连片，人人进学把书念，
    一马冲破文化关，作家诗人田头见。
    其实那里有什么作家诗人，我们那儿都是泥腿子，庄稼汉。只不过在毛泽东时代，劳动人民抓住了印把子，既不受人压迫，也不被人剥削，心情舒坦，自然地要唱一唱。还在高级合作社的时候，联合生产大队的已经六十八岁的疏寿祥，唱过一首民歌：
    我像张果老站云头，白胡苍苍来唱歌，
    有人问我为什么，日子越过越快活。这首民歌，把司集公社爱唱民歌的秘密讲出来了。
    但是，唱得更多更响亮，并且运用各种文艺形式，来表现新的生活，那还是大跃进以来的事。
    1958年，党的建设社会主义总路线，发出了万丈光芒，把每个人的心都照亮了。个个鼓干劲，人人争上游，热气腾腾的社会主义建设，激发了大家的创作热情。就在这时候，党号召文化大革命，毛主席提倡收集新民歌，我们全体社员真是欢欣鼓舞，到处“望风采柳”、“即兴唱歌”，出现了一个千人编、万人唱的民歌创作运动。大量的农民歌手在各方面涌现出来，有的全家参加唱歌。坊集大队社员万邦才，全家老少十一口个个欢喜唱歌。儿子是队里俱乐部主任，万邦才参加了黄忠合唱队，老伴夏发英参加了奶奶歌舞队，媳妇参加了三八合唱队，孙儿孙女参加了儿童歌舞队，有时全家还单独组成合唱队，登台演出。总之，在司集公社，青年人唱，老年人唱，男的唱，女的唱，在家里唱，下田干活也唱，几十个人几百个人在一起就大合唱，几个人在一起就小合唱，两个人在一起就对唱，一个人就独唱。编民歌，唱民歌，大家简直成了“歌迷”。社员许良英在插秧时唱道：
    栽秧田里没歌声，栽的慢来又累人，
    亮亮嗓子把歌唱，转眼田里一片青。对我们公社的社员来说，唱民歌就有这样大的用处，它可以代替休息，在干活时唱唱民歌，可以添劲。
    把民歌与大字报结合起来，去批评那些思想落后，生产懒惰的人，真是威风凛凛。我们那里有个女人好吃懒做，外号叫她“懒蚂蝗”，左邻右舍劝她帮她，总是不改。后来她被一首贴在她家堂前的民歌吓醒了，也教育过来了。这首民歌是这样写的：
    我队有个懒蚂蝗，大天四亮不起床，
    早上怕露水，中午怕太阳，
    人人生产打突击，她在家里抱儿郎，
    你要动员她干活，她翘起鼻子不答腔，
    东劝西说开了口，眼睛一翻又装佯：
    “我家小宝要照应，要有好歹谁承当”，
    明明宝宝有人带，撒谎偷懒太荒唐，
    如果坚持不改正，民歌马上唱四方。
    民歌能随编随唱，可以随时唱出公社的现实生活，唱出社员对党对领袖的敬爱。总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，使大家更加深刻认识到党和毛主席的正确领导，我们社员最爱唱自己编的这样一首民歌：
    长江水，不断流，唱起山歌口难收，
    千句万句并一句，一句唱到心里头：
    幸福全亏毛主席，愿他多福又多寿。
    大家自编自唱，做什么就唱什么，唱出那些不怕困难，克服困难，战胜自然的英雄气概。在抗旱斗争中，社员们劈开了山岭，把巢湖的水引过山岗，这在公社化以前，想也不曾想过，但是现在却凭着自己的双手劈山引水了，这就教育了广大社员认识到人定胜天的道理。社员们用了成千成万动人的抗旱诗歌，表现了自己的斗志和决心。例如：
    社员都是英雄汉，敢想敢说又敢干，
    湖水搬上黄山顶，地球也得随我转。刚刚摘掉文盲帽子的高文华，唱出了一首被人说成是革命浪漫主义的抗旱民歌，他唱道：
    天上银河万里长，牛郎织女各一方，
    如今车干天河水，男耕女织永成双。
    浪漫主义这个名词，庄稼汉对它并不熟悉，但是我们那儿的民歌手在编唱民歌时，总是爱夸张，爱用比喻，爱把静止的事物，说成有生命的东西，并且总要把自己的理想写到新民歌里面去。例如要农业丰收，条件是很多的，积肥是重要的一条。道理极为明显，事情也很普通。但是我们的歌手，却把积肥事儿唱得活灵活现
  一首积肥民歌唱道：
    村村肥泥堆连堆，堆个懒龙通上天，
    遇到社员一声吼，吓的懒龙滚下田，
    懒龙摇身猛一变，变做庄稼戳破天，
    秋收粮食堆成山，懒龙堆子又还原。
    公社化以后，妇女群众特别高兴。公社办起了食堂、幼儿园，妇女摆脱了家务劳动的牵扯，她们在下工以后，就有更多的时间来参加歌唱活动了。五岳生产大队孙业珍，天生成一副好嗓子，喜欢跳舞唱歌。公社化以前，有一次为了欢迎远方参观的客人，乡里举行联欢晚会，有她一个演出节目，但是被繁重的家务缠得走不脱，等饭烧好，服侍孩子睡好，晚会已经结束。她受到大家的责备，说她耽误了演出，使她受到很大委屈。公社成立以后，她一家都在食堂吃饭，两个孩子送进托儿所，从此摆脱了家务劳动，她既是生产能手，也是文化活动的积极分子，1959年到北京参加过八省市歌舞观摩演出，她情不自禁地编了下面这首民歌：
    妇女如今大翻身，三餐茶饭不用问，
    生产战线显能手，秧歌唱到北京城。
    年青的妇女唱，年老的妇女也在唱，七十八岁汪长英老奶奶唱道：
    莫笑我牙齿不关风，偏要唱个东方红，
    千句并作一句唱，感谢领袖毛泽东。
    我引用了社员创作的这样多民歌，不过是说明我们那儿的人好唱歌。其实我们公社的歌唱运动与别的地方比较还是不够的，就以我们安徽枞阳县来说，他们那里，就编过唱过不少好民歌，他们创作的那首民歌，如“稻堆脚儿堆的圆，社员堆稻上了天，撕片白云揩揩汗，对着太阳吸袋烟。”就是我们那里最喜爱唱的，所以我们除自己创作外，也喜欢唱外省外县的好民歌来丰富我们的文化生活，我们知道，喜欢唱歌，不过是文化生活中的一个方面，和全国劳动人民一样，我们的爱好也是多方面的。党鼓励我们说，劳动者一旦掌握了自己的命运，当上文化的主人，就必然要从各方面去掌握文化知识，从各方面去创造我们劳动人民自己的文化。除了唱歌以外，我们公社有业余文工团一个，大型剧院一座，生产队里有业余文工队三十五个。全社还有七个中心俱乐部，一个电影放映队，三十五个幻灯放映站。公社还有文化馆、图书馆、展览馆各一个。各生产大队也都有图书室、科技讲演室、技术研究组。小学教育已经普及，青壮年文盲已经扫除，目前有四所农业中学，一所普通中学。去年下半年，公社还成立了文联，文联下面有二百六十七个创作组。公社办有石印油印报刊两种，有线广播站一个，有五十个宣传队，有六十七个读报组，其他如田间土广播、生产鼓动牌、跃进宣传坊、黑板报到处都有。体育活动也较活跃，有三十五个篮球队，有的大队还有女子篮球队。在保健方面有医院一所，妇产院七所。这些文化组织，和围绕这些组织所展开的各种文化活动，使整个公社开始形成了文化大普及的局面。人们把这种局面说成是“生产大跃进，文化插翅飞”。大跃进以来，全社创作了一百零三万首民歌，画了二千八百多幅大型壁画，写了二百七十多个剧本、曲艺、小说，十一支民间音乐合奏曲，创作了十一个舞蹈，一百四十三支舞曲和歌曲，挖掘整理了三百八十六首有曲谱的民歌，在全国和省内报刊上发表的民歌和民间乐曲就有六百五十七首。省电影制片厂还把社员的生产和文化活动拍成了“司集新春”影片。这里需要提出的是在1958年秋天，中央文化部和中国音乐家协会在我们公社开过一次全国社会主义歌唱运动现场会议，使我们得到了许多宝贵的指示，学到了兄弟省区的先进经验，对我们那里的文化活动是一个大大地鼓励，也是一个大大地推动。
    我们的文化活动坚决地贯彻了为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务的方针。1959年6月间，在社里棉花发生虫害的时候，各个大队的文化组织把治虫的方法用诗画的形式，制成治虫技术牌，插到田头，社员看画唱歌，学到了防治方法，把八千多亩受害的棉花在三天内全部治好了。
    去年秋耕秋种时，各生产队都开展了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。当时农活多，劳力紧，大家都要争先完成任务，农活太紧的队得不到应有的支援，业余文工团就编排了一个提倡共产主义大协作的戏，到各队巡回演出。胡集、上龚生产队看完了这出戏以后马上相互组织支援。胡集生产队用麦种、耕牛支援上龚生产队，上龚队也马上派出四个整劳力帮助胡集队抢割晚稻。
    在大搞工具改革运动中，公社展览馆发挥了不小的作用。江道法看到自己仿制的棉花条播机在展览馆展出以后，积极性更高，干劲更足，在十多天中又接连试制了运肥滑车、插秧指行器等七种新农具，社员们看了，也都动手创造新式工具，技术革命马上在公社推广开来。展览馆展出的关于公社的远景规划，更给每个社员极大的鼓舞，坊集一个队，原来生产较差，社员看过远景规划后，生产劲头更足，出勤率达到满堂红。他们看到水利化、机械化、电气化的理想正在逐步实现，欢欣鼓舞地唱道：
    “耕地驾铁牛，眨眼就到头，一片稻
    播地，顷刻乌油油，老牛点头笑，说我已
    落后，申请到公社，转业当奶牛。”
    1959年，五岳大队富农分子阴谋瓦解食堂，破坏人民公社。在党支部的指示下，俱乐部立即编写“食堂好”一个戏，进行演出，群众看了以后，受到深刻的教育，西娄村社员娄良法编了一首诗，当场揭穿富农分子王青花的阴谋，他愤怒地唱道：
    富农分子王青花，瞎眼睛、瘪嘴巴，
    外表是个笑面虎，肝里暗藏剑一把，
    煽动群众散食堂，破坏公社心毒辣，
    如今拿出照妖镜，看你坏蛋那里藏。
    由于社员的冲天干劲，由于文化工作为政治服务，为生产服务，我们努力实现生产上的持续跃进。1958年获得全社大丰收，光荣地出席了1958年底全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表大会。获得了国务院的奖励。1959年又战胜了夏秋之间的特大干旱，赢得比1958年更大的丰收。单位面积产量与1958年相比，粮食增长47．7％，棉花增长59．6％。农林牧副渔和社办工业，也都获得全面大发展。社员平均收入增长52．6％。得到安徽省人民委员会奖给的“生产优胜”红旗。
    由于生产大跃进，文化大跃进，大家更是劲上加劲，喜气洋洋，人人心情舒畅。工作上事事政治挂帅，宣传当先；生产上生龙活虎，干劲冲天，一有任务，广播筒一叫，要生产，立即上阵出工；要开会，大家齐到会场。平常，文化馆、图书馆、展览馆，都是社员最爱到的场所。在村头、路口、田头、塝头，都有土广播、跃进坊、跃进门、鼓动牌，所有这些都成为广大社员的良师益友，人人从那上面学到政治时事，学到科学技术知识。大字报更是生动活泼，威力无比。1958年9月，有一位同志参加我们那里的一次现场会以后，曾经留下这样一首诗：
    一进司集气象新，　思想解放振人心，
    播下文化革命种，　跃进花开万年春。
    壁画满墙诗兴高，　遍地歌声红旗飘，
    画得禾苗绿又壮，　唱得山幌地又摇。
    跃进门坊跃进貌，　处处吹起跃进号，
    跃进乡里跃进人，　跃进之中比英豪。
    这是对我们工作过高的称赞。如果说，我们在文化大普及方面有成绩，这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是上级党的正确领导和广大社员鼓干劲的结果。我们知道，我们所取得的成绩距离文化革命的要求还很远。我们要继续努力，以不断革命的精神，永远沿着毛主席所指引的道路奋勇前进，高举三面红旗，为继续实现生产大跃进，实现文化大革命而努力奋斗。
