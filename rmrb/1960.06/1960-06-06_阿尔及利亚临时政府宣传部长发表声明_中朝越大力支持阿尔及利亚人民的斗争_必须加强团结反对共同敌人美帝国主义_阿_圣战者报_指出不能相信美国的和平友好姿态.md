Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 3rd: According to a report from the "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station here on the 2nd, the Minister of Information of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government, Mohammed Yazid, issued a statement saying that during the recent visit of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Krim Belkacem to the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, these three countries decided to strengthen their material and moral support for the Algerian people.

He also said that during the delegation's visit to China, they met with Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other Chinese leaders, and studied the Algerian situation with them. The delegation and the Chinese government agreed that the Algerian Republic Provisional Government should establish a diplomatic representative office in Beijing to consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries. The Algerian government will soon send an official delegation to Beijing.

He said that after studying the international situation with the governments of the three countries, they unanimously agreed that the aggressive activities of French and American imperialism pose a threat to the freedom of people all over the world.

He said that the delegation members delivered speeches in the capitals of these three countries, condemning US imperialism for standing with France and participating in the Algerian war, and pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other Western countries such as West Germany are providing France with massive military assistance.

He added that the delegation pointed out that the United States' policy in Taiwan—an inseparable part of China—and its policies towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are the sources of tension in Asia and also endanger world peace.

He concluded by saying that we and the governments of the three countries unanimously believe that it is necessary to strengthen the unity of the people of all countries in order to fight against our common enemy, US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Tunis dispatch: Following the visit of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation to China, North Korea, and Vietnam, the Algerian National Liberation Front's official newspaper "El Moudjahid" published an editorial on May 31st entitled "Unite Against Imperialism."

The editorial stated that the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are all friendly countries that recognized the Algerian Republic Provisional Government from the very beginning. During our delegation's visit, these countries decided to further provide assistance to our liberation struggle.

The editorial stated that in order to strengthen our relations with China, the Algerian Republic Provisional Government has proposed to the Chinese government to send an Algerian diplomatic delegation to be stationed in Beijing. This proposal has been accepted. The Algerian Republic Provisional Government will send a formal delegation to reside in China for a long period.

The editorial said that when discussing the development of the international situation, the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation and the representatives of China, Vietnam, and Korea unanimously believed that the aggressive conspiracies of French and American imperialism in Asia and Africa are a threat to the freedom of the people of all countries. The Algerian delegation in Beijing, Hanoi, and Pyongyang condemned the collusion between the United States and French colonialists in the Algerian war. The delegation also emphasized that the French government's Algerian policy is also supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and certain Western countries, especially West Germany.

The editorial stated that the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation also noted that the United States' policies, especially its policy towards Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and its policies in Vietnam and Korea, are the constant causes of tension in Asia and a threat to international peace.

The editorial then pointed out, "Therefore, it is imperative for the people of all countries to unite to combat the common enemy of imperialism. The Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation reached a complete consensus with the governments of China, Vietnam, and Korea that the people of our countries must strengthen their unity in the struggle against imperialism."

The editorial said, "Based on the policies pursued by the United States in Algeria and in other countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, it is obvious that Western imperialism cannot possibly approve of a genuine relaxation of the international situation. American and French imperialists want a cold war, not relaxation, because the cold war allows them to further continue implementing their policies of enslaving and aggressing against Asian and African countries."

The editorial asked, how can we take as genuine the United States' claim that it wants to make efforts for peace and friendship between the people of all countries when it has been continuously supporting the colonialists' war of annihilation against the Algerian people for many years?

The editorial said that since the United States recently expressed to De Gaulle its full support for France's North Africa policy, how can we Algerians believe the fine words of American leaders who claim that they oppose colonialism and are loyal to the cause of liberation?

The editorial then asked again: Hasn't Eisenhower reiterated his confidence in the war policy implemented by the French government in Algeria?

The editorial said that if the US government believes that such news is not factual, then it should deny it, if it has the courage. The editorial said that the people of the whole world today have clearly recognized the disastrous policies of the West. The situation is developing rapidly, and the revolutionary upsurge of the people of all countries is shattering the chains imposed on the people by imperialism, colonialism, and their running dogs everywhere.

"El Moudjahid" finally called on the people of North African countries to closely observe the development of the international situation and draw all necessary lessons from it. It said that they can no longer tolerate the massacres being carried out in Algeria under the protection of Western countries. (Attached picture)

    阿尔及利亚临时政府宣传部长发表声明
    中朝越大力支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争
    必须加强团结反对共同敌人美帝国主义
    阿“圣战者报”指出不能相信美国的和平友好姿态
    新华社开罗3日电　据这里“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台2日报道，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣传部长穆罕默德·亚齐德发表声明说，在副总理兼外交部长克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团最近访问中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国期间，这三个国家决定加强对阿尔及利亚人民的物质和道义的支持。
    他又说，阿尔及利亚代表团在访问中国期间，会见了毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和其他中国领导人，并且同他们研究了阿尔及利亚的局势。代表团和中国政府同意阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在北京设立外交代表机构以便巩固两国的友好关系。阿尔及利亚政府不久将派遣一个官方代表团去北京。
    他说，代表团同三国政府研究了国际局势以后，一致认为，法国和美国帝国主义的侵略活动形成对全世界人民的自由的威胁。
    他说，代表团人员在这三个国家的首都发表了演说，谴责美帝国主义站在法国一边，参与阿尔及利亚战争，并且指出，北大西洋公约组织和西德等其他西方国家给予法国大量军事援助。
    他又说，代表团指出，美国在台湾——中国的不可分割的一部分——的政策，对待朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的政策是亚洲的紧张局势的根源，并且也危及世界和平。
    他最后说，我们同三国政府一致认为，有必要加强各国人民的团结，以便同我们的共同敌人美帝国主义进行斗争。
    新华社4日讯　突尼斯消息：在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团访问中国、朝鲜、越南之后，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”5月31日发表了题为“联合起来反对帝国主义”的社论。
    社论说，中国、越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国都是从一开始就承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的友好国家。在我们代表团访问期间，这些国家决定进一步对我们的解放斗争提供援助。
    社论说，为了加强我们同中国的关系，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府向中国政府建议派遣阿尔及利亚外交代表团驻在北京。这项建议已被接受。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府将派遣一个长驻中国的正式代表团。
    社论说，在讨论国际形势的发展时，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团同中国、越南和朝鲜的代表们一致认为，法帝国主义和美帝国主义在亚洲、非洲的侵略阴谋是对各国人民的自由的威胁。阿尔及利亚代表团在北京、河内和平壤谴责美国同法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚战争中狼狈为奸。代表团还强调指出，法国政府的阿尔及利亚政策也受到北大西洋公约组织和某些西方国家，特别是西德的支持。
    社论说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团还注意到，美国的政策，特别是他对中国领土的不可分割的一部分台湾的政策，以及在越南和朝鲜的政策，是造成亚洲紧张局势的经常性的原因，也是对国际和平的威胁。
    社论接着指出，“因此，各国人民迫切需要联合起来打击共同的敌人帝国主义。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团同中国、越南和朝鲜政府取得完全一致的意见，认为我们这些国家的人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中必须加强团结”。
    社论说，“根据美国在阿尔及利亚和在非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲其他国家所奉行的政策，显而易见，西方帝国主义是不可能赞成真正的国际局势缓和的。美国和法国帝国主义者要冷战而不要缓和，因为冷战可以使他们更进一步继续执行他们的奴役和侵略亚非各国的政策。”
    社论责问道，美国多年以来不断支持殖民主义者针对阿尔及利亚人民的歼灭战争，我们怎么能把美国声称要为和平和各国人民之间的友好作出努力的表示当作真的呢？
    社论说，既然美国最近向戴高乐表示它完全支持法国的北非政策，那么，我们阿尔及利亚人怎么能相信美国领导人宣称他们反对殖民主义和忠于解放事业的好听话呢？
    社论接着又责问道：艾森豪威尔不是重申他信任法国政府在阿尔及利亚实行的战争政策吗？
    社论说，如果美国政府认为，这样一些消息不符合事实，那么它就应该加以否认，如果它有勇气的话。社论说，全世界人民今天已经清楚地认识到西方的造成祸害的政策。形势发展很快，各国人民的革命的兴起，到处粉碎了帝国主义、殖民主义和它们的走狗所强加于人民的锁链。
    “圣战者报”最后呼吁北非各国人民密切注视国际局势的发展，并且从中吸取一切必要的教训。它说，他们不能再容忍在西方国家庇护下在阿尔及利亚进行的屠杀。（附图片）
