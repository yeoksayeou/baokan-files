    Protesting American Enslavement and Plunder of the Philippines
    Philippine Workers to Demonstrate Against Eisenhower

    Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 7th. The executive committee of the National Federation of Labor Unions (NAFLU), the largest labor union organization in the Philippines, decided on the evening of the 6th to hold a demonstration in front of the American Embassy on the day Eisenhower arrives in Manila, to express “the dissatisfaction of the Filipino people towards the United States due to the American foreign policy towards the Philippines.”

    Lacsina said that the demonstration will be led by the union's national cadres and will begin in front of the American Embassy on the afternoon of June 14th, when Eisenhower is expected to pass by this location on his way from the airport to the Philippine Presidential Palace.

    According to United Press International, the Philippine labor union's announced protest plan "greatly surprised the Philippine authorities." This American news agency immediately promoted that the Philippine authorities should "exert pressure to stop the demonstration." The Mayor of Manila, Lacson, hurriedly told United Press International reporters today that he had ordered the police authorities to arrest anyone attempting to hold a demonstration.
