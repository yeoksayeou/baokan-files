    Two Umbrellas
    I was pushing two hundred *jin* of wheat to the Huajiao Grain Station to sell as public grain. On the road, I ran into rain, and I quickly took off my clothes and covered the bags of wheat. But the rain was too heavy to cover them. I wanted to find a place to take shelter from the rain, but I couldn't find a house anywhere. At this moment, two Young Pioneers came towards me with umbrellas. From afar, they asked, "Uncle, what are you pushing? Public grain? This won't do!" One child handed me his umbrella, "Take it." "One isn't enough," the other child also handed me his umbrella. I quickly said, "Don't give me both your umbrellas, you'll get sick if you get wet in the rain." They repeatedly said it was okay, and they securely tied the umbrellas to my cart. I saw that their clothes were all wet, and the rain dripped straight from their foreheads. I really felt bad and was about to return one of the umbrellas to them, but they insisted, "Public grain is important," "We're not afraid of getting wet," "When you come back, just send the umbrellas to Huajiao Primary School." Saying that, they flew forward like two little eagles. Looking back, I could still see their two bright red scarves from afar.
    Later, I only found out that one Young Pioneer's name was Wang Yixiu, a fifth-grade student at Huajiao Primary School.

    两把雨伞
    我推着两百斤麦子到花茭粮站交售公粮。在路上，正碰上了下雨，我忙把衣服脱了下来，盖在麦袋上。可是，雨太大了，盖不住。我想找个地方避避雨，可四处找不到房子。这时，迎面来了两个打着雨伞的少先队员。他们在老远就问道：“叔叔你推的啥？公粮？这怎么行呢！”一个孩子把自己的伞递给了我，“拿去”。“一把不行”，另一个孩子也把他的伞递给了我。我忙说：“你们别把雨伞都给我，淋了雨要生病的。”他们口口声声说不要紧，并且还把伞牢靠地绑在我的车子上。我看见他们身上的衣服都淋湿了，雨水从他们的额前直滴，我实在过意不去，准备还给他们一把伞，可是他们坚持说：“公粮要紧”、“我们不怕淋”、“你回来把雨伞送到花茭小学就行了”。说着就像两支小鹰一样向前飞去了。我回头看过去，老远还见到他们那两条鲜艳的红领巾。
    后来，我只打听到一个红领巾的名字叫王衣秀，是花茭小学五年级学生。
