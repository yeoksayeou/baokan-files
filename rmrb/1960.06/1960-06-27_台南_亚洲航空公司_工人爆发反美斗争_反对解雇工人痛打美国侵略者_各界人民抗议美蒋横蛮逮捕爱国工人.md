Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Taipei News: The Chinese workers of the American "Asia Airlines" in Tainan City, who have been persisting in an anti-American struggle for more than two months, beat American aggressors on June 24th when they could no longer tolerate it. Patriotic workers were arrested, which aroused anti-American anger among people from all walks of life in Tainan City. That night, many people rushed into the local court to protest, demanding the immediate release of the arrested workers.

On that day, a group of Chinese workers went to find Vigit Leamon, the director of the Tainan repair shop of "Asia Airlines," to continue protesting against the crimes of the U.S. side in unreasonably dismissing workers, deducting workers' wages, and insulting Chinese workers. However, this American rogue treated the Chinese workers' protests with an extremely brutal and vile attitude, which aroused the great anger of the Chinese workers, who beat him severely.

According to the American United Press International, U.S. Embassy officials in Taiwan were "shocked" that "this beating occurred at a time when labor unrest in Formosa (referring to Taiwan) is becoming increasingly serious." They even slandered the Chinese workers of "Asia Airlines" as a "mob" and lodged a so-called "verbal protest" with the Chiang Kai-shek group regarding the beating of Vigit Leamon. At the same time, the American aggressors of "Asia Airlines" in Tainan notified the local police to arrest a group of Chinese workers, and sent four of them to the Tainan City Local Court of the Chiang Kai-shek group, preparing to try them for so-called "crimes of assault and disturbing public order."

The act of the United States colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek group to persecute Chinese workers of "Asia Airlines" aroused great indignation among people from all walks of life in Tainan City. On the evening of the 24th, many people rushed into the Tainan City Local Court to protest, their emotions were high, demanding the immediate release of the arrested patriotic workers. The protest of Tainan citizens at the court lasted for six and a half hours. Later, the Tainan City Police Department of the Chiang Kai-shek group dispatched a large number of police in the middle of the night to temporarily "disperse" the demonstrators.

The news also said that as early as three weeks ago, the Chinese workers of "Asia Airlines" in Tainan City surrounded the residence of Weisiti, the vice president of the company, angrily throwing stones at the American aggressor's residence and smashing the door, protesting against the unreasonable dismissal and insult of Chinese workers by the U.S. side.

The news said that the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," "Ministry of Interior" and other four ministries and police officials of the Chiang Kai-shek group had held an "emergency joint meeting" with American officials on the 24th to discuss the anti-American incident of "Asia Airlines." After receiving the "verbal protest" from the U.S. Embassy, Shen Jianhong, the spokesman of the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek group, shamelessly said that the "law enforcement agencies" of the Chiang Kai-shek group "have taken steps to prevent such incidents from happening." The director of the Labor Bureau of the "Ministry of Interior" of the Chiang Kai-shek group also shamelessly said that the Chiang Kai-shek group "will try to persuade the dismissed workers to accept the opinions of Asia Airlines," that is, preparing to persecute the dismissed workers of "Asia Airlines."

"Asia Airlines" is an American company chaired by Stuput, former commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. This company has taken in a large number of American rogues, thugs and special agents, often engaged in drug trafficking and smuggling, with many dark secrets. Therefore, in the past few years, more than 2,000 Chinese workers working in "Asia Airlines" have often been involved in anti-American incidents. This anti-American struggle, which has persisted for more than two months and is developing, was caused by the unreasonable dismissal of 27 workers including Cai Jianhai and Gao Deshuo by the American aggressors on April 1. Now, more than 2,000 Chinese workers of "Asia Airlines" insist that the U.S. side must fully reinstate the jobs of Cai Jianhai and the other 27 workers, and that the wages for the period when they were unreasonably dismissed must also be paid in full. At the same time, the U.S. side must abolish all regulations that cruelly exploit and discriminate against Chinese workers. The anti-American struggle of the workers of "Asia Airlines" has won the support of people from all walks of life in Taiwan. At present, the people of Taiwan are angrily and closely watching the development of the "Asia Airlines" incident.

    台南“亚洲航空公司”工人爆发反美斗争
    反对解雇工人痛打美国侵略者
    各界人民抗议美蒋横蛮逮捕爱国工人
    新华社26日讯　台北消息：已经坚持了两个多月反美斗争的台南市美国“亚洲航空公司”中国工人，6月24日在忍无可忍的情况下，痛打了美国侵略者，爱国工人竟遭逮捕，因而激起了台南市各界人民的反美怒火，当晚有许多人冲进地方法院表示抗议，要求立即释放被捕工人。
    这一天，一群中国工人前去找寻“亚洲航空公司”台南修配所主任维季·莱蒙，对美方无理解雇工人、克扣工人工资和侮辱中国工人的罪行继续提出抗议。但是，这个美国流氓对中国工人的抗议，竟以极端横蛮恶劣的态度来对待，于是激起了中国工人的极大愤怒，群起把他痛打一番。
    据美国合众国际社消息，美国驻台湾“大使馆”官员对于“这次殴打发生在福摩萨（指台湾）劳工动荡不安的现象日益严重的时候”，感到十分“震惊”。他们竟然诬蔑“亚洲航空公司”中国工人为“暴众”，就维季·莱蒙被痛打一事向蒋介石集团提出所谓“口头抗议”。与此同时，台南“亚洲航空公司”的美国侵略者竟通知当地警察逮捕了一批中国工人，并且把其中四名工人押往蒋介石集团台南市地方法院，准备以所谓“打人和破坏治安的罪名”加以审讯。
    美国勾结蒋介石集团迫害“亚洲航空公司”中国工人的行为，激起了台南市各界人民的极大愤慨。24日晚上，许多人冲进台南市地方法院表示抗议，群情激昂，要求立刻释放被捕的爱国工人。台南市民在法院的抗议一直坚持了六个半小时，后来蒋介石集团台南市警察局在半夜三更出动了大批警察，暂时把示威群众“驱散”。
    消息还说，早在三个星期以前，台南市“亚洲航空公司”的中国工人曾包围这家公司的副经理魏思悌的住宅，愤怒地向这个美国侵略者的住宅抛掷石头，并且打烂了屋门，抗议美方无理解雇和侮辱中国工人。
    消息说，蒋介石集团的“外交部”、“内政部”等四个部和警方官员，已在24日与美国官员举行了“紧急联席会议”，讨论“亚洲航空公司”的反美事件。而在接到美国“大使馆”的“口头抗议”以后，蒋介石集团“外交部”发言人沈剑虹竟无耻地说，蒋介石集团的“执法机构已经采取步骤，防止此类事件发生”。蒋介石集团“内政部”劳工局长也无耻地说，蒋介石集团“将设法说服被解雇的工人接受亚航的意见”，也就是准备对“亚洲航空公司”被解雇的工人加以迫害。
    “亚洲航空公司”是由前美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普担任董事长的美国公司。这家公司收容了大批美国流氓、恶棍和特务人员，经常从事贩毒走私等勾当，黑幕重重，因此，几年来，在“亚洲航空公司”工作的二千多中国工人常常发生反美事件。这次已坚持了两个多月并且正在发展的反美斗争，是由于美国侵略者在4月1日无理解雇蔡建海、高德硕等二十七名工人引起的。现在，“亚洲航空公司”二千多中国工人坚持美方必须全部恢复蔡建海等二十七名工人的工作，并且在他们被无理解雇时期的工资，也必须全部照付。同时，美方必须取消残酷剥削、歧视中国工人的各种条例。“亚洲航空公司”工人的反美斗争获得了台湾各阶层人民的声援和支持。目前，台湾人民正在愤怒地密切注视“亚洲航空公司”事件的发展。
