Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: In order to guarantee the sustained leap forward in production and construction this year, factories and mines across the country are vigorously strengthening labor protection work and carrying out the "Ten Defenses and One Elimination" movement. "Ten Defenses and One Elimination" refers to: preventing collisions, collapses, explosions, electric shocks, poisoning, dust, fires, flooding, burns and scalds, and eliminating fatal accidents. Through this movement, we can better ensure safe production and the health of workers.

The strengthening of labor protection work in enterprises across the country is being carried out in conjunction with the technological innovation and technological revolution movements. The broad masses of workers have carried out many creative reforms aimed at key issues in safety technology, ensuring safe production and the health of workers, and promoting the development of production. In the coal industry, hydraulic coal mining has been promoted, greatly reducing the dangerous factors for mining workers; Kailuan Zhaogezhuang and Chongqing Yutianbao and other coal mines have created three-no work faces unprecedented in the history of coal mining, that is, no people, no pit props, and no electric conveyors in the work face, eliminating the threat of roof collapses, coal dust and gas explosions; small coal kilns in Hunan and Sichuan have promoted the use of earthen lamps and earthen batteries instead of open-flame lamps, preventing gas explosion accidents. In the metallurgical industry, many small blast furnaces have realized mechanized charging, and many steel rolling mills have realized full mechanization and automation. These measures have to a considerable extent eliminated the heavy labor of workers and reduced the threat of dust, high temperatures, and splashing molten iron causing injury. The automatic lifting platforms adopted in construction projects have replaced scaffolding, which not only saves wood, but also greatly reduces the risk of high-altitude fall accidents. In addition, the mechanization of concrete mixing, automatic bricklaying machines, mechanized transportation, mechanized woodworking, and automatic production lines for reinforcing steel have all changed the heavy physical labor. Some advanced technologies created by workers in the machinery manufacturing system in riveting, electric welding, casting, forging hammers, etc., have also eliminated to some extent the dangers of cutting and punching machines causing injury, as well as the hazards of electric arc eye damage, noise, smoke, dust, and high temperatures. The workers on the transportation front have also created some machines and operating methods that are conducive to the safe operation of vehicles and ships.

Since last year, factories, mines, construction sites, and transportation enterprises across the country have generally carried out several mass safety production inspection campaigns. Through inspections, they have revised and improved safety production rules and regulations, and summarized and promoted advanced experiences in safety production. According to statistics from sixteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, more than 1,000 provincial-level safety regulations have been issued. In addition to revising and establishing enterprise safety regulations, workers in factories and enterprises in Xi'an City have also formulated nearly 60,000 safety covenants. Many enterprises have equipped full-time cadres and established and improved labor protection agencies. Various regions have also held more than 2,000 exhibitions to extensively exchange advanced experiences in labor protection work and expand publicity and education on safe production. More than 10,000 advanced units and hundreds of thousands of advanced individuals in safe production that have emerged across the country have become models for the broad masses of workers in factories and mines to learn from. The recent safety production inspection campaign carried out in various places focuses on solving key problems that are prone to accidents, and incorporates the discovered problems that need to be solved into the planning of technological innovation and technological revolution, in order to systematically improve working conditions and eliminate various dangerous and harmful factors. Various regions are also preparing to carry out mass safety production competitions and appraisals in this year's inspection campaign.

At present, as summer approaches, enterprises across the country are actively promoting last year's experience in preventing heatstroke and cooling down, and are actively implementing various measures for preventing heatstroke and cooling down. Before last year, cooling measures had basically been taken in high-temperature workplaces in enterprises. This year, enterprises across the country are preparing to further add new facilities and improve the cooling effect of the original facilities.

In order to make labor protection work better adapt to the new situation of the development of socialist construction and the sustained leap forward in production, the Ministry of Labor and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the Fourth National Labor Protection Work Conference in mid-April. It summarized the experience of labor protection work in the Great Leap Forward, further studied labor protection work under the new situation of technological innovation and technological revolution, and determined the work tasks for 1960.

### 结合技术革命开展“十防一灭”确保安全生产  各地厂矿大力加强劳动保护工作

    结合技术革命开展“十防一灭”确保安全生产
    各地厂矿大力加强劳动保护工作
    新华社4日讯　为了保证今年生产建设的持续跃进，各地的厂矿企业正在大力加强劳动保护工作，开展“十防一灭”运动。“十防一灭”是：防止撞压、坍塌、爆炸、触电、中毒、粉尘、火灾、水淹、烧烫和坠落，消灭死亡事故。通过这个运动，更好地保障安全生产和职工健康。
    各地企业加强劳动保护工作，是结合着技术革新和技术革命运动进行的。广大职工针对安全技术方面的关键问题，进行了许多创造性的改革，保障了安全生产和职工健康，促进了生产的发展。在煤炭工业方面，推行了水力采煤，大大减少了采掘工的危险因素；开滦赵各庄和重庆鱼田堡等煤矿创造了采煤史上从未有过的三无工作面，即在工作面中无人、无坑木、无电溜子，免除了冒顶和煤尘、瓦斯爆炸的威胁；湖南、四川的小煤窑中推行了用土电灯、土电瓶代替明火灯，防止了瓦斯爆炸事故。冶金工业方面，许多小高炉实现了上料机械化，许多轧钢厂实现了全盘机械化、自动化，这些措施都在相当程度上免除了工人的繁重劳动，减少粉尘、高温和铁水喷溅伤人等等威胁。建筑工程方面采用的自动升降台、代替了脚手架，既节省了木材，也大大减少了发生高空坠落事故的危险。此外，混凝土搅拌的机械化，自动砌砖机，运输机械化，木工机械化和钢筋工序自动线等等，都改变了笨重的体力劳动。机械制造系统的工人们在铆接、电焊、铸造、锻锤等方面创造的一些先进技术，也在一定程度上消除了切削、冲床可能伤人的危险以及电光灼眼、噪音、烟尘和高温等危害。交通运输战线的职工们，也创造了一些有利于车船运行安全的机械和操作方法。
    去年以来，各地的工厂、矿山、建设工地和交通运输企业，普遍开展了几次群众性的安全生产大检查运动，通过检查，修订和健全了安全生产的规章制度，总结和推广了安全生产的先进经验。据十六个省、市、自治区的统计，仅全省性的安全规章制度就颁发了一千多项，西安市各工厂企业的职工，除了修订和建立企业的安全规章外，还订了近六万个安全公约。许多企业配备专职干部，建立和健全了劳动保护机构。各地区还先后举办了二千多次展览会，广泛交流了劳动保护工作的先进经验，扩大安全生产的宣传教育工作。各地涌现出来的一万多个安全生产先进单位和十几万名安全生产先进人物，成为厂矿企业广大职工学习的榜样。最近各地开展的安全生产大检查运动，更着重解决容易发生事故的关键问题，把所发现的、需要解决的问题纳入技术革新和技术革命的规划里，有计划地改善劳动条件，消灭各种危险和有害的因素。各地还准备在今年的检查运动中开展群众性的安全生产竞赛评比。
    目前夏天将临，各地企业正纷纷动手推广去年的防暑降温经验，积极实现各种防暑降温措施。去年以前，企业中的高温作业场所基本上都已经采取了降温措施，今年各地企业准备要进一步增添新的设施，并且提高原有设施的降温效果。
    为了使劳动保护工作更好地适应社会主义建设事业发展和生产持续跃进的新形势，劳动部、全国总工会在4月中旬召开了第四次全国劳动保护工作会议。总结了大跃进中劳动保护工作经验，进一步研究了技术革新和技术革命运动新形势下的劳动保护工作，确定了1960年的工作任务。
