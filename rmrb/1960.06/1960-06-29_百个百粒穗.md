    Hundred Ears with Hundred Grains
    Last autumn, the members of the good seed breeding farm of our Dajiao Commune selected a hundred-grain wheat plant as seed. This year, it produced a total of two hundred and forty-one ears, of which one hundred and fifteen were large ears, each with more than one hundred grains. The largest ear had one hundred and thirty-two grains. We have now harvested and threshed these wheat ears separately and stored them, ready to plant again this autumn for cultivation and propagation.

    百个百粒穗
    去年秋季我们大交公社良种繁育场的场员们，选了一株百粒穗小麦做种子，今年共长出二百四十一个穗，其中有一百一十五个大穗，每穗都在百粒以上，最大的一穗是一百三十二粒。现在，我们已经把这些麦穗单收单打保存起来，准备今年秋天再种，进行培育繁殖。
