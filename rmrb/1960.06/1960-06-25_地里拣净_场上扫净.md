    Shaanxi: Assign Sections to Teams and Pick Up Everything While Harvesting
    (Our report) When summer harvesting basically ended in the southern Shaanxi and Guanzhong regions of Shaanxi Province, they immediately launched a second summer harvest campaign of extensive gleaning, picking, and sweeping. All localities organized auxiliary labor into small summer harvest professional teams to glean scattered wheat ears, wheat grains, wheat straw, bean pods, and bean vines from the fields, roadsides, and threshing grounds. Incomplete statistics from Lintong, Xingping, Xianyang (two counties and one city), and five communes in five counties, including Dali, show that more than 150,000 people participated in the small summer harvest professional teams, recovering more than 2.3 million jin of wheat in a very short time, as well as a large amount of beans, straw, vines, etc. During threshing, various localities also carried out re-threshing. Mian County re-threshed 85,000 jin of grain from the wheat straw of 40,000 mu of wheat.
    This year's summer harvest in various parts of Shaanxi was generally more meticulous and thorough than in previous years. However, because the wheat matured at the same time this year, dried quickly, and the wheat grains were full and the wheat mouths were loose, there were incidents of dropped ears and grains during harvesting. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, all localities drew on the experience of last year's small summer harvests and small autumn harvests, and organized auxiliary laborers such as children and the elderly into small summer harvest professional teams during harvesting, setting times, plots, tasks, and quality standards, assigning sections to teams, and ensuring that no ears or grains were lost.

    Sichuan: Cadres Take the Lead in Picking Up Wheat Ears
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. After the basic completion of spring crop harvesting in various parts of Sichuan Province, a mass movement of spring crop re-harvesting and re-threshing was immediately launched.
    During the re-harvesting and re-threshing, all localities designated special personnel to be responsible for strengthening specific leadership, and mobilized the masses to adopt the methods of gleaning, turning over, picking, and sweeping to universally re-harvest and re-thresh.
    Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the fields to lead the re-harvesting and re-threshing work. Niu Tianluan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Nanchong Prefectural Committee, picked grain in Laolin Commune with Zhang Zhenzhong, the first secretary of Yingshan County, and Secretary Li Bingquan and other comrades when they inspected work in Yingshan County. They found that about five to ten jin of grain could be picked up per mu of wheat land, and immediately issued a call to the masses of the county to carry out "careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and everyone should harvest ten more jin of grain and two liang of oil." Liangshui Commune in this county picked up more than 1,000 jin of grain in just one day.

    Anhui: Reform Tools to Speed Up Re-harvesting Progress
    (Our report) After basically completing the wheat harvesting task, various parts of Anhui launched a wheat re-harvesting and re-threshing movement. Communes and brigades in many areas established re-harvesting and re-threshing headquarters, and production teams established inspection and acceptance groups. In Linquan County, Fuyang Prefecture, more than 68,000 auxiliary laborers, organized into more than 2,200 professional teams, re-harvested 1.07 million mu, and re-threshed 4.5 million jin of wheat, averaging 4.4 liang per mu. Huangcang Commune in Xiaoxian County, which achieved a large-scale wheat harvest last year, also proposed the slogan "No ears left in the field, no grains scattered on the threshing ground." The entire commune was composed of more than 6,000 auxiliary laborers, forming 264 re-harvesting and re-threshing professional teams, carrying out a re-harvesting and re-threshing movement in the fields and threshing grounds: "Gleaning clean in the fields, picking clean on the roads, beating clean on the stalks, and sweeping clean on the threshing ground."
    People's communes in various localities also paid attention to the reform of re-harvesting tools in order to speed up the progress of re-harvesting and improve the quality of re-harvesting. The re-harvesting professional team in Funan County enlarged the rakes for picking up wheat, increased the number of spikes, and added rakes, which not only did not leak wheat, but also did not leak grass; their imitated sweeper could sweep up the broken wheat on the road, improving the quality of re-harvesting; an improved two-person wheat picking device increased work efficiency by twenty times compared to manual wheat picking.

    陕西：分片包干随收随拾
    本报讯　陕西省的陕南、关中地区在夏收基本结束时，立即展开了大搂、大拾、大扫的第二次夏收运动。各地都把辅助劳力组织成小夏收专业队，到地里、路旁、场边、拾拣抛撒的麦穗、麦粒、麦草、豆荚、豆蔓等。单是临潼、兴平、咸阳两县一市和大荔等五个县的五个公社不完全统计，参加小夏收专业队的就有十五万多人，很短时间内就收回小麦二百三十多万斤，还有大量的豆子、草、蔓等。在脱粒中各地还进行了复碾。沔县就从脱过粒的四万亩小麦的麦草中，复碾出八万五千多斤粮食。
    今年陕西各地夏收一般比往年收的细、收的净。但是，因为今年麦子成熟集中，干的快，麦粒饱满，麦口松，因此收割中有遗穗掉粒现象。为了确保丰产丰收，各地都吸取了去年小夏收、小秋收的经验，在收割时就把儿童、老人等辅助劳力组成了小夏收专业队，定时间、定地段、定任务和定质量，分片包干，作到块块不让、片片拾到，保证穗粒不丢。
    四川：干部带头拾麦穗
    据新华社成都讯　四川省各地人民公社在小春作物基本收完后，立即掀起群众性小春作物复收复打运动。
    在复收复打中，各地都确定专人负责，加强具体领导，并发动群众采取拣、翻、摘、扫办法，普遍复收复打。
    各级领导干部都深入田间领导复收复打工作。中共南充地委宣传部长牛天鸾在营山县检查工作时，和这个县第一书记张振中、书记李炳全等同志，在老林公社冒着烈日拣粮。发现每亩小麦地约可拣回五至十斤粮食，便立即向全县群众发出开展“精收细打，每人多收十斤粮、二两油”的号召。这个县的凉水公社仅一天时间就拣回粮食一千多斤。
    安徽：改革工具加快复收进度
    本报讯　安徽各地在基本完成小麦收割任务之后，又开展了小麦的复收复打运动。许多地区的公社、大队，分别成立复收复打指挥部，小队成立检查验收小组。阜阳专区临泉县，组织老年人、儿童等辅助劳动力六万八千多人，二千二百多个专业队，复收一百零七万亩，复打出小麦四百五十万斤，每亩平均合四斤四两。去年获得小麦大面积丰收的萧县皇藏公社，还提出“田里不丢穗，场上不撒粒”的口号，全社由六千多个辅助劳动力，组成二百六十四个复收复打专业队，在田间、场上开展“地里拣净、路上拾净、秸上打净、场上扫净”的复收复打运动。
    各地人民公社，还注意了复收工具的改革，以加快复收的进度和提高复收质量。阜南县的复收专业队把拾麦的筢子加大、增多钉齿，带上箆子，使用起来不仅不漏麦子，也不漏草；他们仿制的扫地机可扫净路上的碎麦，提高了复收质量；一种改进后的二人操作拾麦器，比手工拾麦提高工效二十倍。
