    Self-Reliance: County-Run University
    Deng Feng, Representative of Pingyao County Comprehensive University, Shanxi Province
    Pingyao County Comprehensive University was born during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It was developed on the basis of Pingyao No. 1 Middle School by adopting the method of "putting on a hat" and "putting on boots." Currently, the university department has two two-year teachers' college classes in Chinese language and mathematics, graduating this summer, and one three-year industrial college class, graduating next summer, with a total of 69 students in the three classes. Including primary, middle, and kindergarten schools, there are a total of 2,404 students. People call it a "four-story building, one-dragon" comprehensive university. The school also has a sizable factory, farm, and livestock farm.
    Although Pingyao Comprehensive University has been established for less than two years, under the guidance of the Party's education policy, under the direct leadership of the Pingyao County Party Committee, and with the strong support of the people of the county, it has made remarkable achievements and initially accumulated some experience in running county-run universities through the efforts of all teachers, students, and staff.

    Interlocking Rings, One-Dragon
    Seek Success First, Then Perfection
    Pingyao Comprehensive University does not simply piece together the four levels of schools—university, middle school, primary school, and kindergarten—but organically combines the four levels of schools in teaching practice. This form of schooling can not only give full play to the role of some excellent teachers in middle schools and the capacity of existing middle school equipment, but also solves the difficulties of county-run universities that have "three no's": no teachers, no high school graduates, and no decent equipment. According to the principles of using local materials, learning while teaching, and gradually improving, we selected some excellent high school teachers to teach university courses, excellent junior high school teachers to teach high school courses, outstanding normal school students to teach junior high school courses, and excellent high school students to teach junior primary school courses. This method of "interlocking rings, one-dragon" not only solved the difficulty of the lack of teachers, but also, because the teaching and research groups were established with veteran teachers and excellent teachers as the center, the teaching ability of teachers and the academic performance of part-time students have gradually improved. This ensures the continuous improvement of teaching quality. The result is not that there are fewer junior high school and high school teachers, but that a group of new junior high school, high school, and university teachers are rapidly growing. Teaching aids, instruments, and production bases are planned uniformly and arranged reasonably for middle schools and universities. One set of equipment is used comprehensively. For example, the machine factory can be used for teaching and practical training of the industrial college class, as well as for on-site teaching of mathematics and science courses in the middle school class. At the same time, it is easy to equip a chalk factory, a small woodworking factory, etc., suitable for the characteristics of primary schools. When conducting scientific research, teachers in specialist classes cooperate with teachers in middle school classes, teachers cooperate with students, lower-grade teachers are assistants to higher-grade teachers, and lower-grade students are assistants to higher-grade students. This method of vertical and horizontal combination and complete supporting facilities provides extremely favorable conditions for carrying out scientific research, conducting teaching reforms, and improving teaching quality. At the same time, it provides great possibilities for understanding the laws of intellectual development and personality growth of students at all levels from kindergarten to university, effectively improving students' knowledge level, cultivating students' communist world outlook, and making students well-rounded new people.
    Running county-run universities is our bold attempt and is driven by the excellent situation of industrial and agricultural development since the Great Leap Forward. In the new era of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, the Pingyao County Party Committee encountered the difficulty of insufficient talent in various aspects of construction and realized that as industrial and agricultural production grows day by day, this problem will become bigger and more numerous. Therefore, the county committee wanted to establish a county-run university in our county. However, under the conditions of the "three no's," how can we realize this wish? Should we wait until we have university professors, high school graduates, teaching equipment, and other conditions before running the university, or should we explore a new way for county-run universities based on our existing conditions? After repeated research, the county party committee decided to establish a regular county-run university on the basis of Pingyao Complete Middle School that is different from the comprehensive universities usually referred to and different from the red and expert spare-time universities currently run in large numbers by factories and rural areas. However, the growth of new things always has to go through twists and turns and struggles. Some people with bourgeois educational viewpoints and educational thoughts sarcastically said: "It cannot be a university without professors. Without recruiting high school graduates, university students cannot be cultivated. Without university equipment, university knowledge cannot be learned." Our view is that the law of development of any thing is always from nothing to something, from low to high. We should adopt an attitude of seeking success first and then perfection towards new things. We followed the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, starting from scratch, and poor people should have lofty aspirations. Without professors, we used excellent high school teachers to teach university courses, learning before teaching and teaching while learning, and fully exploited the collective wisdom of the teaching and research groups. We hired leading comrades from the Party and government and technicians from county-run factories and mines to give political and technical classes. In addition, we used the "borrowing the east wind" method to invite cadres who had been transferred to lower levels for labor training to give concentrated lectures on professional courses and help cultivate new professional course teachers. Without high school graduates, we recruited working-class and peasant intellectuals, on-the-job workers, peasants, cadres, and primary school teachers who had a certain level of education. Without university teaching equipment, we used and modified high school equipment, made our own teaching aids, used production income to increase the purchase of instruments, and made full use of the equipment of our own factories and farms and visits to other places to initially solve the difficulties of teaching equipment.

        Reform Teaching According to Actual Needs
    After the university was established, the struggle between two educational ideologies was again exposed in terms of the academic system, curriculum, teaching content, and teaching methods. Some people with bourgeois educational thoughts said: If we want to run a university, we must run it in a decent manner, and it should be like "Tsinghua" and "Peking University," otherwise it is not enough to be called a university. It is like "planting a big tree in a flower pot," which will inevitably lead to "neither literary nor military success." Of course, "Tsinghua" and "Peking University" are good schools. With the development of our country's cultural and educational undertakings, our country will inevitably have more and better "Tsinghua" and "Peking University." However, the view that a newly established county-run university should meet the standards of "Tsinghua" and "Peking University" in everything is obviously divorced from reality and does not conform to the policy of developing education in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Through many major debates, the above-mentioned opinions were refuted with sufficient reasons, and we persisted in proceeding from actual needs and using a revolutionary spirit to carry out a series of reforms in the academic system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods. In terms of the academic system and professional settings, according to the county's urgent need for talents and the possibility of cultivating professional talents, it was decided to run two two-year normal school classes and one three-year industrial college class. The teaching process was to first spend half a year making up for the relevant high school basic knowledge, and then learn professional courses, reflecting the spirit of bamboo shoots bursting forth, rising steadily. In terms of curriculum setting, adhering to the spirit of combining current needs with future systematic improvement, and following the guiding ideology of "excelling in one major and combining several" and "specializing in one skill and having multiple abilities," the courses were taught in a suitably concentrated manner. In terms of teaching content, the teachers compiled and taught outlines or lecture notes based on the training objectives and the full estimation of students' learning initiative and enthusiasm, and adopted a method that combined "swallowing ravenously" with "chewing the cud." Teachers were required to explain key teaching materials in depth and thoroughly, and students were required to study and chew them carefully. The progress of general teaching materials was accelerated to lay the foundation for self-study and future self-improvement. For example, the literary history course in the normal school Chinese class adopted the method of attacking points (in-depth analysis of representative writers and typical works) and expanding the scope (appropriately introducing contemporary writers and general works) along the line (along the historical sequence), so that students learned quickly and deeply. In the entire teaching activity, classroom teaching was still the main form, but based on the characteristics that students have certain practical experience and strong comprehension ability, classroom teaching, classroom discussion, on-site teaching, and extracurricular reading were combined. The mass line was implemented in teaching work. For example, in the literary theory class of the Chinese language department, after the teacher explained Chairman Mao's literary thought in class, the students were mobilized to read literary books and organized classroom discussions. Taking the "Human Comedy" by the 19th-century French writer Balzac as an example, a heated debate was launched on "whether there is a contradiction between the writer's world outlook and creative method." With the opposing side, the students more actively read and studied reference books, searched for arguments, and conducted debates. Finally, the teacher summarized, which effectively deepened the students' understanding of the teaching materials and improved the students' analytical and critical abilities. When students in the electromechanical class of the industrial college studied mechanical principles, they used the form of classroom discussion to solve difficulties and the method of systematic review, and the effect was good. 90% of the students got excellent grades of around 90 points. When studying electrical instruments in electrical engineering, it was not easy to understand in classroom lectures, so students were organized to visit the electrical appliance factory on site and asked the factory masters to explain with real objects, so that they not only understood the principles but also learned how to operate.
    The university classes also carried out more than 20 scientific research activities such as semiconductor refining and trial production of indigenous motors, and combined them with teaching and production labor. Under the conditions of no blueprints, no materials, no experience, and no equipment, the students participated in the design work of the trial-produced motor, drew according to the design blueprints, and participated in the actual operation of mechanical processing. In this way, the students not only clarified the operating technologies such as line winding, short-circuit inspection, and slip ring production, but also comprehensively consolidated the professional knowledge of mechanical drawing, mechanical principles, and electrical engineering.
    In view of the students' low and uneven level, the teachers also combined teaching with self-study counseling and adopted the method of "three supplements, three helps, and one encouragement": supplementing middle school courses, supplementing difficult-to-learn teaching materials, and supplementing students with poor foundations. Teachers personally helped, designated people helped, and students helped each other. In three forms, they constantly encouraged students' learning confidence. Therefore, students had great enthusiasm for learning and made rapid progress.
    The normal school class broke the convention of studying pedagogy first and then practicing. From the time they entered school, the students taught junior high school courses part-time and tried to be class teachers. Veteran teachers were mobilized to take apprentices, help lecture students analyze the text, impart teaching methods, and conduct on-site demonstrations. The lecturing students improved their academic level through individual lesson preparation, collective research, teaching activities, summary evaluation, etc.

        A Glorious Page in the History of County Education
    In the past two years, because we have always adhered to the principle of combining theory with practice, teaching with production labor, and political activities, students have learned solid knowledge, obtained excellent academic results, and powerfully refuted the erroneous arguments of those with bourgeois ideological viewpoints. In two years, the 49 students in the Chinese language class of the normal school not only made up for the relevant courses in high school, but also completed professional courses such as Chinese modern literary history, ancient literary history, literary theory, and modern Chinese. They also studied Chinese history, and each person read more than 50 classical, "May Fourth," and modern excellent works on average. They carried out criticism of literary thought and created many poems, novels, essays, etc. Normal school students were generally welcomed by junior high school students in their lectures. The lecturing students were not just teachers who could teach one subject, but all-rounders who could teach several subjects. Students in the Chinese language class could teach Chinese, history, and politics, and students in the mathematics class could teach mathematics, physics, politics, and other courses. This year's graduates from the normal school class can meet the needs of junior high school teachers in our county this year. This is a glorious page in the history of education in our county and a great victory for the Party's education policy.
    The electromechanical class of the industrial college made up for high school mathematics and physics courses in half a year and completed analytical geometry, mechanical principles, and mechanical drawing in one year. Outside of class, they also read more than 40 kinds of reference books such as motor manufacturing and metal cutting. They went to the countryside to support industrial and agricultural electrification and participated in production labor such as motor manufacturing in electrical appliance factories for 72 days, which greatly improved the quality of their studies. After the students in this class graduate next year, they will add a group of highly skilled technical talents to local industry.
    University students also participated in rectification with county cadres and participated in the political movements of various periods in the county. They received all-round training, initially transformed their world outlook, and enriched their knowledge of class struggle and production struggle. They have developed in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education.
    The fundamental reason for the above-mentioned achievements lies in the leadership of the Party. Ren Jingfu, the first secretary of the county party committee, concurrently served as the secretary of the school party committee and president, and constantly came to the school to provide specific guidance, which is the decisive factor in running a county-run university well. We are also fortunate to have received the personal guidance of Comrades Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng at the time of our founding. In the process of running the school, we have always received the strong support of the provincial and prefectural party committees whenever we encountered twists and turns and difficulties. This has increased our confidence, boosted our morale, persisted, and constantly improved.
    Although our school has achieved the above-mentioned achievements and explored some preliminary experience, there are still many problems that need to be solved in such a new type of county-run university. According to the needs of local construction, the scale of the school urgently needs to be further expanded, and existing experience urgently needs to be continuously improved. We believe that as long as we can adhere to the implementation of the Party's education policy, adhere to our school-running direction, and constantly overcome difficulties and create new experiences, a regular county-run comprehensive university with a considerable scale of four professional departments of engineering, agriculture, medicine, and teachers will definitely be run well.

    自力更生  县办大学
    山西省平遥县综合大学代表　邓峰
    平遥县综合大学，是在1958年大跃进中诞生的。它是在平遥第一中学的基础上，采用“戴帽”、“穿靴”的办法发展起来的。现有大学部二年制师范专科语文、数学两个班，今年暑期毕业，三年制工业专科一个班，明年暑期毕业，三个班共有学生六十九人；连同中、小学、幼儿园共有学生二千四百零四人。人们称它为：“四层楼一条龙”的综合大学。学校还附设有相当规模的工厂、农场、畜牧场等。
    平遥综合大学成立到现在虽然还不到两年，但是在党的教育方针的指导下，在中共平遥县委的直接领导下，在全县人民的大力支持下，经过全校师生员工的努力，已取得显著的成绩，初步积累了一些县办大学的经验。
    连环套　一条龙
    先求成　后求全
    平遥综合大学，不是把大、中、小、幼四级学校简单地拼凑在一起，而是在教学实践中把四级学校有机地结合起来，这种办学形式不仅可以充分发挥中学某些优秀教师的作用，和中学现有设备的能力，而且解决了县办大学没有教师，没有高中毕业生，没有像样的设备的“三没有”的困难。我们根据就地取材，边教边学，逐步提高的原则，选拔了一部分高中优秀教师教大学课程，初中优秀教师教高中课程，师专优秀学生兼教初中课程，高中优秀学生兼教初小课程，这种“连环套，一条龙”的办法，既解决了教师缺乏的困难，又由于以老教师、优秀教师为中心建立了教研组，使教师教学能力和兼课学生的学业成绩逐步地提高了起来，这便保证了教学质量的不断提高，这样做的结果，不是初中、高中教师少了，而是有一批初中、高中、大学的新教师迅速地成长起来了。教具、仪器、生产基地，中学、大学，统一筹划，合理安排，一套设备，综合利用，如机械厂，既可供工专班教学实习之用，又可作为中学班数、理课的现场教学之用，同时，又很容易地装备了适合于小学特点的粉笔制造厂，小木工厂等。在进行科学研究的时候，专科班教师与中学班教师合作，教师与学生合作，低年级教师是高年级教师的助手，低年级学生是高年级学生的助手。这样纵横结合、成龙配套的办法，对于开展科学研究，进行教学改革，提高教学质量，提供了极为有利的条件，同时，对于了解从幼儿园到大学各级学生的智力发展和个性成长的规律，有效地提高学生的知识水平，培养学生的共产主义世界观，使学生成为全面发展的新人提供了极大的可能性。
  县办大学是我们大胆的尝试，是大跃进以来工农业发展的大好形势逼出来的。中共平遥县委在技术革命与文化革命的新时期，遇到了各方面建设人才不足的困难，同时又意识到随着工农业生产的日益发展，这方面的问题会更多更大，于是便想在我县创办一座县办大学。但是，在“三没有”的条件下，如何实现这个愿望呢？是等待着具有了大学教授，高中毕业生，教学设备等条件之后才办呢，还是要根据我们现有的条件摸索一条县办大学的新出路呢？县委经过反复研究之后，便决心在平遥完全中学的基础上创办一所既不同于通常所说的综合大学，又不同于目前工厂、农村大量举办的红专业余大学的县办正规大学。但是，新事物的成长，总是要经过曲折与斗争的，一些具有资产阶级教育观点和教育思想的人，便冷讽热嘲地说：“没有教授就不成其为大学，不招收高中毕业生，就培养不出大学生来，没有大学设备，那能学到大学知识。”我们的看法是任何事物的发展规律，总是从无到有，由低到高，对新鲜事物应抱着先求成，后求全的态度，我们本着自力更生，白手起家，穷人要有志气的革命精神，没有教授就用高中优秀教师教大学的办法，先学后教，边学边教，充分发挥教研组的集体智慧，聘请党政领导同志和县营厂矿的技术人员，讲政治课与技术课，另外，用“借东风”办法请中央下放劳动锻炼的干部集中讲授专业课。并帮助培养了新的专业课教师。没有高中毕业生，就招收具有一定文化程度的工农知识青年、在职工农干部和小学教师。没有大学教学设备，就利用和改装高中设备，自制教具，用生产收入增购仪器，充分利用自办工厂、农场的设备与外出参观等办法，初步解决了教学设备的困难。
        根据实际需要改革教学
    大学办起以后，在学制、课程、教学内容、教学方法等方面，又暴露出了两种教育思想的斗争，一些具有资产阶级教育思想的人说：既要办大学，就要办得像个样子，就应该像“清华”、“北大”那样，否则就不足以称其为大学。就是在“花盆里栽大树”，必然要弄个
  “文不成，武不就”。当然，“清华”、“北大”是好学校，随着我国文化教育事业的发展，我们的国家必将出现更多更好的“清华”、“北大”。然而，要求一个初创的县办大学一切都以“清华”、“北大”为标准的观点，显然是脱离实际的，是不符合多快好省地发展教育事业的方针的。通过多次大争大辩，以充分理由驳倒了
  上述意见，坚持了从实际需要出发，用革命的精神，对学制、课程、教材、教法都进行了一系列的改革。在学制与专业设置上根据本县需要人才的迫切性与培养专业人材的可能性，决定办两个二年制师专班，一个三年制的工专班，教学进程是先用半年时间补起有关的高中基础课知识，然后学专业课程，体现了春笋怒放节节高的精神；在课程设置上，掌握当前需要与将来系统提高相结合的精神，本着“精一兼数”、“一专多能”的指导思想，把课程适当集中的讲授。教学内容上，根据培养目标和充分估计学生学习的自觉性和积极性，教师自编讲授提纲或讲义，采用了“狼吞虎咽”与“含英咀华”相结合的方法。对关键性教材要求教师讲深讲透，学生深钻细嚼，一般教材则加快进度，为自习与将来自己进修打下基础，如师专语文班讲授文学史，采用了沿线（沿着历史顺序）攻点（深入分析代表作家、典型作品）扩面（适当介绍同代作家和一般作品）的办法，学生学的又快又深。在整个教学活动中，仍以课堂教学为主要形式，但根据学生有一定的实际经验，理解能力较强的特点，把课堂教学、课堂讨论、现场教学、课外阅读结合起来。贯彻了教学工作中的群众路线。如语文科的文艺理论课，教师在课堂讲解了毛主席的文艺思想后，发动学生阅读文艺书籍，组织课堂讨论，以十九世纪法国作家巴尔扎克的“人间喜剧”为例，对“作家的世界观和创作方法有无矛盾”，展开了热烈的争论，有了对立面，学生更加积极翻阅钻研参考书，寻找论据，进行辩论，最后教师总结，这便有效地加深了学生对教材的理解，提高了学生分析批判能力。工专机电班学生学机械原理时，用课堂讨论的形式解决难点和系统复习的方法，效果良好，有90％的学生得到了九十分左右的优良成绩。学电工学的电学仪表时，课堂讲授不易理解，就组织学生到电器厂现场参观，请工厂的师傅用实物讲解，不仅懂了原理，还学会了操作。
    大学班还开展了半导体提炼，试制土电机等二十多项科学研究活动，并与教学、生产劳动结合起来。在没图纸、没材料、没经验、没设备的条件下，学生参加了试制电机的设计工作，按设计图纸进行描绘，并参加了机械加工的实际操作。这样一来，学生不仅明确了线路绕阻、短路检查、集流环制作等操作技术，而且全面地巩固了机械制图、机械原理、电工学等专业知识。
    教师针对学生程度低，而又参差不齐的情况，还把教学与自习辅导结合起来。采取了
  “三补、三帮、一鼓励”的办法：补好中学课，补好难学的教材，补好基础差的学生。教师亲自帮，指定专人帮，学生相互帮，三种形式，不断鼓励学生的学习信心。因此，学生学习劲头大，进步快。
    师专班，打破了先学教育学后实习的惯例，学生从入学起就兼教初中课和试做班主任，并发动老教师带徒弟，帮助讲课学生分析课文，传授教法，现场示范，讲课学生通过个人备课，集体研究，教学活动，总结评议等，提高了学业水平。
        县教育史上光辉一页
    二年来，由于我们始终坚持了理论联系实际、教学与生产劳动、政治活动相结合的原则，学生学到了扎扎实实的知识，获得了优异的学业成绩，有力地反驳了那些具有资产阶级思想观点的人们的错误论调。师专语文班四十九个学生，在二年内不仅补起了高中有关课程，学完了中国现代文学史，古代文学史，文艺理论，现代汉语等专业课程，并且学习了中国历史，每人平均还阅读了古典的、“五四”以来的、现代的优秀作品五十余册，开展了文艺思想批判，创作了许多诗歌、小说、散文等。师专学生在讲课中，普遍受到初中学生的欢迎。讲课的学生，不只是光能教一门课的教师，而且是能教几门课的多面手。语文班学生是能教语文、历史、政治，数学班学生是能教数学、物理、政治等课程。师专班今年毕业的学生，可以满足我县今年初中师资的需要。这是我县教育史上光辉的一页，是党的教育方针的大胜利。
    工专机电班，半年补起了高中数理课，一年学完了解析几何、机械原理和机械制图。在课外还阅读了电机制造、金属切削等四十多种参考书。他们下乡支援工农业电气化，在电器厂参加电机制造等生产劳动七十二天，大大提高了学业质量。明年该班学生毕业后，将给地方工业增添一批水平较高的技术人才。
    大学生还随同县干部进行了整风，参加了全县各个时期的政治运动，受到了全面锻炼，初步改造了世界观，丰富了阶级斗争、生产斗争知识，在德育、智育、体育等方面都得到了发展。
    取得上述成绩的根本原因，是在于党的领导。县委第一书记任井夫同志兼任了学校党委书记和校长，不断到学校具体指导，这是办好县办大学的决定因素。我们还幸运的是在创办的时候就受到了陆定一同志和康生同志的亲自指导，在办学过程中，每逢遇到曲折与困难的时候，总是得到省委和地委的有力支持。这就使我们提高了信心，鼓足了干劲，坚持下来，不断提高。
    我们学校，虽然取得了上述的成绩，摸索到了一些初步的经验，但是这样一座新型的县办大学需要解决的问题是会很多的。根据地方建设需要，学校的规模急需继续扩大，现有经验急需继续不断完善。我们相信，只要能够坚持贯彻执行党的教育方针，坚持我们的办学方向，不断的克服困难，创造新的经验，一座具有相当规模的工、农、医、师四种专业系科的正规的县办综合大学，一定会办好的。
