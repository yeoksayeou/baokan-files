Eisenhower's Trip to Taiwan is a Provocation to China
The US propaganda machine reveals that Eisenhower's trip attempts to continue the conspiracy of "two Chinas" and permanent occupation of Taiwan. This once again exposes the aggressive policy of US imperialism, which is determined to be hostile to the Chinese people.
Xinhua News Agency, June 14th. Amidst the flames of anger against US imperialism burning across Asia, US President Eisenhower will "visit" Taiwan, our territory under US armed occupation, on the 18th. News and articles published by US news agencies and some American newspapers confirm that Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan is full of gunpowder and once again exposes the US imperialist policy of continuing to occupy Taiwan, create "two Chinas," and resolutely antagonize the Chinese people.

According to a report from Taipei by United Press International on May 31, Eisenhower's "primary task during his trip to Taipei will be to reaffirm US support for the Kuomintang regime" and to "boost the morale of the 600,000 Chiang soldiers who maintain a near-wartime alert day and night." The report also said that Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan is an attempt to "firmly fix the current US policy toward China so that a Democratic president cannot change it in the near future."

An op-ed in the "Washington Star" on June 3 more nakedly revealed that the purpose of Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan was to deliberately provoke the 650 million Chinese people. In this article, American columnist Walter said that Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan was not only to "offer direct assurances of continued US support" to the Chiang Kai-shek group, but also to use the so-called "personal presence to issue a new threat to the CCP (referring to the righteous struggle of our people to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Ma Zu), 'warning' it in the strongest possible way."

At the same time, the "New York Times" published an article by its reporter Jacques Nevart on June 1, dispatched from Taipei on May 31, revealing that Eisenhower would continue to play the conspiracy of the United States to create "two Chinas" during his "visit" to Taiwan. In this article, titled "Taiwanese Seek Eisenhower's Aid," it was revealed that the United States, on the one hand, expressed its intention to continue supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group, and on the other hand, "in view of the downfall of the unpopular regimes in South Korea and Turkey," the United States intends to create a so-called "Taiwanese Taiwan" to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan. The "New York Times" reporter viciously and openly incited Taiwan to secede from the motherland, falsely claiming that mainland compatriots in Taiwan are "foreigners," and encouraged a small group of pro-American "Taiwanese independence elements" to submit a "petition" through American officials when Eisenhower arrives in Taiwan, requesting American "aid," saying that Eisenhower will require the Chiang Kai-shek group to ensure that "Taiwanese parties" "gain a place on the ballot" in future elections. According to a United Press International report from Washington on the 9th, "The White House will consider advocating that Eisenhower hold talks with Taiwanese leaders during his upcoming visit to Formosa (referring to Taiwan)," a suggestion made to Eisenhower by Congressman Porter, who is keen on creating "two Chinas."

It is worth noting that on June 10, on the eve of Eisenhower's upcoming "visit" to Taiwan, the US Court of Appeals suddenly issued a "ruling" using the excuse of two Chiang army air force lieutenants who announced their defection from the Chiang Kai-shek group while training in the United States in 1953, and actually wrote in the "ruling" that "because Formosa is a very clear geographical, social, and political entity, and because there is a government on Formosa that undeniably controls the island, we believe it is a country." It is not difficult to see that this kind of shouting by the US Court of Appeals is entirely to footnote the so-called "de facto political entity" of Taiwan by the deceased former US Secretary of State Dulles. The US Court of Appeals is now digging up the case of the two Chiang Kai-shek air force lieutenants seven years later to make such a "ruling," the purpose of which is clearly to cooperate with Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan and provide a so-called "legal basis" for the United States to step up its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Various facts show that the US conspiracy to "isolate Taiwan" and then "trusteeship Taiwan" is becoming increasingly clear.

The Chinese people have long solemnly declared that Taiwan is an inalienable part of our territory, and we will never allow the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy Taiwan to succeed. No matter what tricks Eisenhower plays in Taiwan, he will never be able to change the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. Eisenhower's sinister activities in Taiwan can only arouse greater anger and condemnation from the entire Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, and the people of the world against US imperialism.

### 艾森豪威尔台湾之行是对中国的挑衅

    艾森豪威尔台湾之行是对中国的挑衅
    美国宣传机器透露，艾森豪威尔此行妄图继续推行“两个中国”和永久霸占台湾的阴谋。这再一次暴露了美帝国主义坚决同中国人民为敌的侵略政策。
    新华社14日讯　在亚洲人民燃遍了反对美帝国主义的怒火中，美国总统艾森豪威尔将在18日到美国武装侵占下的我国领土台湾进行“访问”。美国通讯社和一些美国报纸发表的消息和文章证实，艾森豪威尔这次台湾之行充满了火药味，再一次暴露了美帝国主义要继续推行霸占台湾、制造“两个中国”和坚决与我国人民为敌的侵略政策。
    据美国合众国际社5月31日从台北发出的消息，艾森豪威尔“台北之行的首要任务将是重申美国支持国民党政权”和为了“助长日日夜夜保持着近于战争戒备状态的六十万蒋军的士气。”消息还说，艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾是企图“能够有力地固定美国现在对华政策，使一个民主党总统无法在不久将来予以改变”。
    美国“华盛顿明星报”在6月3日发表的一篇专栏文章中，更加赤裸裸地揭示了艾森豪威尔台湾之行的目的是蓄意对六亿五千万中国人民挑衅。美国专栏作家华特在这篇文章中说，艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾不仅是为了向蒋介石集团“提出美国继续予以支持的直接保证”，而且是企图以所谓“亲身莅临以对中共发出的新威胁（指我国人民一定要解放台，澎、金、马的正义斗争），用可能范围内最有力的方式‘加以警告’”。
    在这同时，“纽约时报”在6月1日刊载了该报记者雅克·尼瓦特5月31日从台北发出的一篇文章，还透露了艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾时将继续玩弄美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。在这篇题为“台湾人谋求艾森豪威尔援助”的文章中，暴露了美国一方面表示要继续支持蒋介石集团，另一方面“鉴于南朝鲜和土耳其的不得人心的政权的垮台”，美国打算制造所谓“台湾人的台湾”来永久霸占我国领土台湾。“纽约时报”记者在文章中恶毒地公开煽动台湾脱离祖国，胡说在台湾的大陆同胞是“外国人”，并且鼓动一小撮亲美的“台湾独立分子”在艾森豪威尔到台湾时通过美国官员提出“请愿”，要求美国“援助”，说艾森豪威尔将要求蒋介石集团保证让“台湾人的政党”在未来的选举中  “取得选票上的地位”。另据合众国际社9日从华盛顿发出消息说，“白宫将考虑主张艾森豪威尔在他即将进行的对福摩萨（指台湾）的访问中同台湾人领袖举行会谈的建议”，这项建议是由热衷于制造“两个中国”的美国众议员波尔特向艾森豪威尔提出的。
    值得注意的是，在艾森豪威尔即将“访问”台湾的前刻，美国上诉法院突然在6月10日以“裁决”1953年在美国受训时宣布脱离蒋介石集团的两名蒋军空军尉官为借口，竟在“裁决书”上写道，“由于福摩萨是一个非常明确的地理、社会和政治实体，并且由于在福摩萨有一个无可争辩地控制着该岛的政府，因此我们认为它是一个国家。”不难看出，美国上诉法院的这种叫喊，完全是替已死去的前任美国国务卿杜勒斯所谓台湾是一个“事实上存在的政治单位”这种说法下注脚。而美国上诉法院在两名蒋介石空军尉官的案件已事隔七年以后，现在还把它翻出来作出这样的“裁决”，其目的显然是配合艾森豪威尔的台湾之行，为美国加紧推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋作出所谓“法律根据”。种种事实说明，美国“孤立台湾”进而“托管台湾”的阴谋越来越明显地暴露出来。
    中国人民早已庄严地宣布，台湾是我国领土不可分割的一部分，绝不容许美国制造“两个中国”、永久霸占台湾的阴谋实现。不论艾森豪威尔到台湾耍什么花招，都绝不能改变中国人民一定要解放台湾的坚决意志。艾森豪威尔到台湾的罪恶活动，只能激起包括台湾人民在内的全中国人民和世界人民对美帝国主义更大的愤怒和谴责。
