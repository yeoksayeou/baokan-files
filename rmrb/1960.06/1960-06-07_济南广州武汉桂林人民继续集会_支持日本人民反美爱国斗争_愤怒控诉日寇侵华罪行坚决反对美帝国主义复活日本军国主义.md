Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: People in Jinan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Guilin, and other places continue to hold rallies to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　Some victims of the bloody massacre created by Japanese imperialism thirty-two years ago – the "May 3rd Tragedy" (Jinan Massacre) – held a rally on the 2nd. They expressed their firm opposition to American imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism. Zhang Yutian, whose elder brother was bombed to death by Japanese fascists in the "May 3rd Tragedy," angrily said, "On May 3, 1928, Japanese fascists fired 3,600 shells at the street where we lived. The whole street was filled with blood and flesh, and the fire blazed into the sky. As a result, only four incomplete houses were left. To forever remember the blood debt owed by the Japanese fascists, we renamed this street 'May 3rd Street.' Today, American imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism, causing Japan to return to the old path of fascist aggression. We firmly stand with the Japanese people and fight to the end against the revival of Japanese militarism." Liu Huchen, who survived the "May 3rd Tragedy," was shot four times in his hands and waist by the Japanese invading army but did not die because he jumped over a wall to escape. He expressed his full support for the Japanese people's just struggle to resolutely stop the war conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and wished the Japanese people would send Japan's militarist forces to the grave as soon as possible.

　　The militiamen of the Sanyuanli Commune militia battalion in Guangzhou City accused the Japanese fascists of their atrocities during their aggression against China at the rally. Li Guangxi, a militia activist in Guangzhou and deputy battalion commander of the Sanyuanli militia battalion, said that more than ten years ago, Japanese fascists committed all kinds of evils in Sanyuanli, including rape, arson, and murder. More than two hundred people died of starvation alone due to being displaced after their houses were demolished by the Japanese invading army. He said: American imperialism wants to support the revival of Japanese militarism and conspires to launch a new aggression, but the Japanese people have awakened. They are waging a resolute struggle against this conspiracy to prevent history from repeating itself. We fully support their struggle and believe they will achieve final victory.

　　The workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant expressed their admiration and support for the Japanese people and workers' persistence in opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and accused the Japanese fascists of the suffering they endured during their aggression against China. Dispatch worker Guan Yingyu said that his grandfather was taken away by Japanese fascists and beaten to death on the front line, and his father had one arm broken by Japanese fascists and was disabled for life. He himself was taken away to work at the age of thirteen, and he still has scars on his body from being bitten by Japanese fascist dogs. He pointed out that the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will be completely crushed by the resolute opposition of the Japanese people.

　　The people of Guilin City, who suffered from the bombing and massacres by Japanese militarism during the War of Resistance Against Japan, were extremely angry at the Kishida Nobusuke group's crime of using force to force the Japanese House of Representatives to "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. During the Japanese fascist aggression against China, this famous city with its beautiful scenery was almost completely looted by the Japanese fascist army, and more than 90% of the houses in the city were destroyed. On the central avenue, more than seven li long, from the North Gate to the South Gate, only three or four complete houses were left. The residents of West Shang Street on this central avenue recently held a rally. Yang Niuzai, a worker in the children's socks workshop of the Guilin Knitting Factory, had his father and sister bombed to death by the Japanese invading army nineteen years ago, and his legs were also broken by machine gun fire from the Japanese fascist army. He was extremely angry after hearing that the Kishida Nobusuke reactionary group was colluding with American imperialism to attempt to launch a new war of aggression. He said: "We want peace, but we are not afraid of war. We have experience in fighting Japanese imperialist aggression. If the U.S.-Japan reactionaries dare to launch a war, they will be met with a devastating counterattack."

    济南广州武汉桂林人民继续集会
    支持日本人民反美爱国斗争
    愤怒控诉日寇侵华罪行坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义
    据新华社6日讯　济南、广州、武汉、桂林等地人民，继续举行集会支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。
    三十二年前日本帝国主义制造的血腥大屠杀——“五三惨案”（济南惨案）的部分受难者2日举行集会。他们表示坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义。哥哥在“五三惨案”中被日本法西斯炸死的张玉田愤怒地说：“1928年5月3日那天，日本法西斯向我们住的那条街开了三千六百发炮弹，全街血肉横飞，火光冲天，结果只烧剩了四间残缺不全的房子，我们为了永远记住日本法西斯欠下的血债，就把这条街改名‘五三街’。今天美帝国主义又在复活日本军国主义，使日本重新走上法西斯侵略的老路，我们坚决和日本人民站在一起，为反对复活日本军国主义而斗争到底”。在“五三惨案”中死里逃生的刘虎臣，当时两手和腰部曾被日本侵略军打中四枪，因为跳墙逃命未死。他表示完全支持日本人民坚决制止美日反动派战争阴谋的正义斗争，并且祝日本人民早日把日本的军国主义势力送进坟墓。
    广州市三元里公社民兵营的民兵们在集会上控诉了日本法西斯侵略中国期间的暴行。广州市民兵积极分子、三元里民兵营副营长李广禧说，十多年前，日本法西斯曾在三元里奸淫烧杀、无恶不作，全村仅因房子被日本侵略军拆掉而流离失所，活活饿死的就有二百多人。他说：美帝国主义要扶植日本军国主义复活，阴谋发动新的侵略，但是日本人民已经觉醒，他们正在为反对这一阴谋进行坚决斗争，不让历史重演。我们全力支持他们的斗争，并且相信他们一定会取得最后胜利。
    武汉钢铁公司炼钢厂的工人们对日本人民和工人坚持反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争表示钦佩和支持，并且控诉了日本法西斯侵略中国期间他们所受到的苦难。调度工关英玉说，他的祖父被日本法西斯掳走后在前线被打死，父亲被日本法西斯打断一支胳膊残废终身；自己在十三岁时便被掠去做工，至今身上还有当年被日本法西斯分子放狼狗咬的伤痕。他指出，美日反动派的阴谋在日本人民的坚决反对下，一定会被彻底粉碎。
    在抗日战争期间惨遭日本军国主义轰炸和屠杀的桂林市人民对岸信介集团用武力迫使日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约的罪行极为愤怒。在日本法西斯侵略中国期间，这座山水秀丽的名城几乎被日本法西斯军队洗劫一空，全市90％以上的房屋被毁。从北门到南门七里多长的市中心大道，仅留下三、四幢完整的房屋。这条中心大道西上街的居民们最近举行了集会。桂林针织厂童袜车间工人杨牛仔十九年前被日本侵略军炸死了父亲和妹妹，自己的双腿也被日本法西斯军队用机枪扫断。他听到岸信介反动集团勾结美帝国主义妄想发动新的侵略战争的情况后愤怒极了，他说：“我们要和平，但是也不怕战争，我们有打击日本帝国主义侵略的经验，如果美日反动派胆敢发动战争，就将遭到毁灭性的回击。”
