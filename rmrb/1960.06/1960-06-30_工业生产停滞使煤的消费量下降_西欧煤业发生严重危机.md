Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: Paris dispatch: A yearly report issued on June 28th by the Coal Committee of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" admitted that the Western European coal industry is undergoing a "serious crisis."

Regarding this crisis, which has persisted for more than two years, the report pointed out that the coal stockpiles near the mines in Western European countries are unprecedentedly huge, having risen from 16 million tons in December 1957 to 68 million tons in December 1959.

The report said that in the two years of 1958 and 1959, the coal consumption of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" countries decreased by 62 million tons, a decrease of nearly 6% per year.

In listing the reasons for the decline in coal consumption, the report mentioned factors such as the "recession in industrial activity" in 1958.

The report believes that the supply and demand relationship for coal in Western European countries will remain "unbalanced" this year. (Attached picture)
