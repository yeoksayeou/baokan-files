(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang dispatch) The early-sown crops in Liaoning Province are a lush green, universally covered by ridges. People's communes throughout the province, under the slogan of "Not a single mu missed, not a single ridge broken, not a single seedling missing," have universally launched a mass field inspection and replanting campaign, striving for complete, uniform, strong, and thriving seedlings. Gaiping County, which acted quickly, has already inspected and replanted over 300,000 mu of land.

Many communes, based on universal inspection and replanting, have adopted the method of "assigning plots to teams, assigning ridges to individuals, bringing seeds to the field, and replanting wherever there is a gap," establishing a responsibility system to completely eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings. To ensure that the replanted crops emerge quickly, commune members are using methods such as soaking seeds to promote germination and replanting with water to facilitate rapid seedling emergence.

Underground insect pests are a major cause of missing seedlings and broken rows. While vigorously carrying out field inspection and replanting, various localities are taking measures to eliminate insects and protect seedlings. In the Chaoyang area, more than 21,000 mu of land were found to be infested with insects in early May. The broad masses of commune members immediately rose up to eliminate them, ensuring that "wherever insect pests occur, they are captured and eliminated," protecting the normal growth of seedlings.

(Xinhua News Agency, Changchun dispatch) Jilin Province has entered the high tide of summer hoeing production, with the focus on ensuring complete and strong seedlings. People's communes are vigorously grasping seedling inspection and replanting, intertillage and weeding, topdressing and irrigation, and pest control, striving for full stands in every plot and thriving plants in every field. As of May 30th, the province's spring-sown crops had been inspected and replanted on 800,000 mu, and over 4 million mu of spring-sown crops had been hoed once.

Since the spring sowing, due to attacks by wind, sand, and frost, a small portion of farmland in various localities has experienced missing seedlings and broken ridges. In response to this situation, people's communes have widely launched a major inspection and replanting campaign to check quality, check seedling emergence, and supplement measures and missing seedlings. More than 20,000 seedling inspection and replanting teams in the Siping and Tonghua areas have adopted the method of inspecting and replanting plot by plot, processing, fertilizing, replanting, and transplanting seedlings on the type three fields with poor sowing quality and missing seedlings, and 460,000 mu of type three seedlings have been upgraded to type one fields. At present, about 70% of the missing seedling fields in the province have been replanted.

Intertillage and weeding are the main contents of field management. In order to achieve timely hoeing and thorough tillage, the grass was hoeed once before the seedlings of sorghum, millet, and other crops emerged, and corn and soybean crops were plowed before hoeing.

Various localities have also particularly strengthened the tillage, topdressing, and weeding of newly reclaimed wasteland. Dunhua County launched a campaign to turn wasteland into fertile land, taking six measures such as multiple tillage and soil accumulation and increased application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to ensure that wasteland and fertile land produce the same yield.

Various localities have also vigorously prevented and controlled plant diseases and insect pests. The plant disease and insect pest prevention and control networks of people's communes in the Siping area closely cooperated and timely eliminated plant diseases and insect pests on 30,000 mu of farmland. Various regions have established more than 70 indigenous pesticide factories, using local materials to produce pesticides.

While strengthening field management, various localities are also grasping the accumulation and production of fertilizer to prepare sufficient topdressing for autumn crops. Yushu County gave full play to the role of more than 1,700 indigenous fertilizer factories and farm manure processing plants, producing more than 760,000 tons of topdressing.

(Xinhua News Agency, Harbin dispatch) In Heilongjiang Province, where the agricultural season is the latest in China, field crops such as soybeans, corn, and sorghum are sown by mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved agricultural tools, making the planting earlier, faster, more numerous, and better. By the end of May, the province had sown 90% of the planned area for field crops, an expansion of several million mu compared with last year. At present, the early-sown crops are already a lush green. Most areas are stepping up intertillage and weeding. During the spring sowing upsurge, more than 10,000 tractors and hundreds of thousands of sets of new-style horse-drawn farm implements were mobilized to rush the planting, with a daily planting speed of more than 3 million mu. By the Xiaoman season, 80% of the province's fields had completed spring planting earlier than in previous years.

Implementing the policy of planting more, harvesting more, high yield, and more income, various localities also adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland for planting and largely planting gaps to expand the planting area. Hailun County, where the grain commodity rate reached as high as 50% last year, mobilized more than 60 tractors to organize expedition teams this spring, plowing and planting simultaneously, expanding the county's planting area by 450,000 mu. At present, all localities in the province are focusing on ensuring uniform, complete, even, and strong seedlings, and vigorously grasping field management. Many areas immediately launched seedling inspection and replanting activities after sowing.

This newspaper reports that the Jinbei area of Shanxi Province is launching a mass movement to transform low-yield areas into high-yield areas and poor areas into rich areas, with the expansion of high-yield grain crops as the center. Therefore, the biggest feature of this year's spring sowing is the unprecedented expansion of the planting area of ​​high-yield crops. According to statistics on May 23, the district’s plan for seven million mu of high-yield crops has been basically completed, and the corn planting area has exceeded the planned area by 120,000 mu; potatoes and sorghum are also close to the plan, and the planting progress of other high-yield crops has greatly exceeded that of previous years. Now all areas are still rushing to plant.

Recently, most of the spring-sown crop seedlings have emerged, and a large-scale seedling management campaign is being widely launched throughout the region.

The expansion of high-yield crop areas in the Jinbei area is proposed by the Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China after studying and summarizing the production rules since liberation for more than ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Jinbei has historically been known for its low yield and barrenness. Extensive cultivation and extensive planting with low yields are the reasons for the low yield, but the small number of high-yield crops is also a major reason. Before liberation, there were few other high-yield crops other than potatoes; after liberation, with the development of the collectivization movement and the innovation of the cultivation system, the varieties and area of ​​high-yield crops gradually expanded. Ten years of practice have proved that the more corn and potatoes are planted in any year, the higher the total output is; conversely, the fewer high-yield crops are planted in any year, the lower the output is. Especially in 1958, which marked a major transformation in Jinbei’s production, high-yield crop land accounting for more than 27% of the total grain land, grain output reached 44.8% of the total output. The Jinbei Prefectural Committee believes that expanding high-yield crops is the key to changing the low-yield situation. Therefore, in determining the grain production plan for 1960, it regards expanding high-yield crops as the central measure for the movement to transform low-yield areas into high-yield areas and poor areas into rich areas.

In order to ensure the implementation of the measures to expand high-yield crops, on the one hand, wasteland is reclaimed, and on the other hand, land is saved, and three million mu of newly expanded cultivated land is added throughout the region. This not only ensures the proportional development of various crops, but also increases the area of ​​economic crops compared with the past.

In order to truly ensure that expanding high-yield crops achieves the goal of high yield, many innovations have been made in sowing. (Picture attached)

    寸垅不断　棵苗不缺　块块全苗　株株茁壮
    东北三省狠抓查田补苗中耕锄草
    晋北大种粮食高产作物　开展苗期管理运动
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省早播作物一片葱绿，普遍罩垅。各地人民公社在“一亩不漏，一垅不断，一棵不缺”的口号下，普遍展开群众性的查田补苗运动，力争苗全、苗齐、苗壮、苗旺。行动较快的盖平县，经过查补的田已达三十万亩以上。
    许多公社在普遍查补的基础上，采取“以组定地块，以人定垅，下地带种，见缺就补”的办法，建立责任制度，彻底消灭缺苗现象。为了使补种的作物出苗快，社员们用浸种催芽、坐水补种等方法，促使幼苗迅速出土。
    地下虫为害是缺苗断条的主要原因之一，各地在大搞查田补苗的同时，都采取措施灭虫保苗。朝阳地区各县5月上旬有二万一千多亩地发现虫害，广大社员立即奋起消杀，做到了“虫害发生在哪里，就捕灭在哪里”，保护了幼苗正常生长。
    据新华社长春电　吉林省进入以苗全苗壮为中心的夏锄生产高潮。各人民公社狠抓查苗补种、中耕除草、追肥灌水和防治虫害，力争农田块块全苗，禾苗棵棵茁壮。到5月30日止，全省春播作物已查苗补苗八十万亩，并有四百多万亩春播作物已经锄过一遍。
    春播以来，由于风沙、霜冻等灾害的袭击，各地都有一小部分农田发生缺苗断垅现象。根据这种情况，各人民公社广泛开展了查质量，查出苗和补措施、补缺苗的大查大补运动。四平和通化地区的两万多个查苗补苗小组，采取逐块查，逐块补的办法，对播种质量较差的和缺苗的三类田进行加工补肥和补种移苗，已有四十六万亩三类苗上升为一类田。目前，全省70％左右的缺苗田已经补足。
    中耕除草是田间管理的主要内容。各地为了做到适时铲趟，细铲细趟，在高粱、谷子等作物禾苗未出土以前就锄草一遍，玉米、大豆作物实行了铲前趟一犁。
    各地还特别加强了新垦荒地的铲趟、追肥工作。敦化县开展起一个荒地赶熟地运动，对新垦荒地采取多铲趟多培土、增施磷钾肥等六项措施，保证荒地和熟地同样增产。
    各地还大力防治了病虫害。四平地区各人民公社的病虫害防治网密切协作，及时的消灭了三万亩农田的病虫害。各地区建立了七十多处土农药厂，就地取材，生产农药。
    各地还在加强田间管理的同时，抓紧积肥造肥，为秋收作物备足追肥。榆树县充分发挥一千七百多个土化肥厂和农家肥料加工场的作用，已制造出追肥七十六万多吨。
    据新华社哈尔滨电　我国农事季节最迟的黑龙江省，大豆、玉米、高粱等大田作物，用机械化、半机械化和改良农具播种，种得又早又快又多又好。到5月底，全省已播大田作物占计划播种面积90％，比去年扩大了数百万亩。目前，早播的作物已经碧绿一片。大部分地区正抓紧进行中耕锄草。春播高潮中，全省出动一万多台拖拉机、几十万套新式马拉农具抢播，每天播种速度达三百多万亩，到小满季节，全省已有80％的大田比往年提早完成了春播。
    贯彻多种多收高产多收的方针，各地在春播中还采用了垦荒播种、大种隙地等办法，扩大播种面积。去年粮食商品率高达50％的海伦县，今春出动六十多台拖拉机组织远征队，随开荒随播种，使全县播种面积扩大了四十五万亩。目前全省各地正在以保证苗齐、苗全、苗匀、苗壮为纲，大抓田间管理。许多地区播种后，立即开展了查苗补种活动。
    本报讯　山西省晋北地区以扩种粮食高产作物为中心，开展低产变高产、穷区赶富区的群众运动。因此今年春播最大特点是高产作物种植面积空前扩大。据5月23日统计，全区七百万亩高产作物计划已基本完成，玉米播种面积已超过计划面积十二万亩；薯类、高粱也接近计划，其它高产作物播种进度都大大超过了往年，现在各地仍在突击下种。
    最近，大部分春播作物幼苗已经出土，全区大规模苗期管理运动正在广泛展开。
    晋北地区扩大高产作物面积，是中共晋北地委研究总结了解放以后十多年来，特别是大跃进以来的生产规律提出来的。晋北历史上以低产、贫瘠著称，耕作粗放、广种薄收是低产的原因，但是种高产作物少也是一个重大原因。解放以前，除山药蛋以外，很少有其它高产作物；解放以后，随着集体化运动的开展和耕作制度的革新，高产作物的品种和面积逐步有了扩大。十年来的实践证明，哪一年种玉米、薯类多，哪一年的总产量就高；相反，哪一年种高产作物少，哪一年产量也就少。特别是标志着晋北生产大转变的1958年，占总粮田27％多的高产作物粮田，粮食产量达到了总产量的44．8％。晋北地委认为，扩大高产作物是改变低产面貌的关键，因此在确定1960年粮食生产计划中，把扩大高产作物作为低产变高产、穷区变富区运动的中心措施。
    为了保证扩种高产作物措施的贯彻执行，一方面开垦荒地，一方面节约用地，全区新扩大耕地三百万亩。这样不仅保证了各项作物按比例发展，同时也使经济作物的面积比已往有了增长。
    各地为了确实保证扩大高产作物达到高产目的，在播种中进行了许多革新。（附图片）
