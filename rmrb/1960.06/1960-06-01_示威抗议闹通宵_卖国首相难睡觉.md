Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st: The Japanese people are demonstrating day and night at Nobusuke Kishi's residence, causing this traitorous prime minister to lament that he "can't sleep well."

A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 30th stated that if Nobusuke Kishi is not prepared to resign, his neighbors hope he can move so they can get a good night's sleep.

The message said that every day, people demonstrate in front of the Prime Minister's private residence in the quiet Nanpeidai residential area. Some monks, beating gongs and drums, arrive at dawn and don't leave until late at night. These persistent monks, along with other demonstrators, shout slogans such as "Kishi Nobusuke resign!" and "Smash the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!"

They do this every day, and this situation has lasted for two weeks. Now, the neighbors' children run around in the streets, imitating the demonstrators by shouting slogans, singing the demonstrators' songs, and "The Internationale."

One of Japan's largest newspapers said in an editorial that it is unfair to the neighbors for Nobusuke Kishi to continue living there, unless, of course, he resigns.

The newspaper said, "If the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet resigns, we dare say the Nanpeidai area can immediately be peaceful, just like the house of Syngman Rhee."

United Press International said that if the demonstrations disturb Nobusuke Kishi's neighbors, think how much they disturb Nobusuke Kishi himself.

According to newspaper reports, Nobusuke Kishi's servants quoted him as saying, "Those monks beating gongs and drums are keeping me from sleeping well."

    示威抗议闹通宵  卖国首相难睡觉
    据新华社31日讯  东京消息：日本人民日夜不停地到岸信介住宅举行示威，使这个卖国首相哀叹他“睡不好觉”。
    合众国际社30日发自东京的一则电讯说，如果岸信介不准备辞职的话，他的邻居们希望他能搬家，以便让他们能够睡个好觉。
    这则消息说，每天都有人在幽静的南平台住宅区的首相私人住宅门前示威游行。有一些敲锣打鼓的和尚，天亮就来，到深夜才回去。这些有恒心的和尚同其他示威者一起高呼“岸信介辞职”和“粉碎日美安全条约”等口号。
    他们每天都这样干，这种情况已经持续了两个星期。现在，邻居的小孩在街上跑来跑去，他们学着示威者高呼口号，唱示威者唱的歌和“国际歌”。
    日本一家最大的报纸在社论中说，岸信介继续住在那里对邻居是不公道的，当然，除非他辞职。
    这家报纸说，“如果岸信介内阁辞职，我们敢说南平台地区马上可以得到安宁，正如李承晚的房子那样。”
    合众国际社说，如果示威打扰了岸信介的邻居，想想看它打扰岸信介到什么程度。
    据报纸消息说，岸信介的佣人援引岸信介的话说，“那些敲锣打鼓的和尚使我睡不好觉。”
