Xinhua News Agency, 28th: From 8:00 AM on the 27th to 8:00 AM on the 28th, within a 24-hour period, it rained in central and eastern Shandong, central and northern Hebei Plain, and southern Henan. This rainfall is beneficial for alleviating the drought in these areas.

The rainfall in the central and northern Hebei Plain was generally between ten and twenty millimeters. Among them, Cang County had the largest rainfall at thirty millimeters, Baoding at forty-five millimeters, and Zunhua at seventy-two millimeters. The area north of Jinan, Shandong, only had three to eight millimeters of rainfall, but southeastern Shandong and the Shandong Peninsula generally had thirty to fifty millimeters of rainfall, with Weihai reaching ninety-six millimeters. Southern Henan generally had twenty to fifty millimeters of rainfall, with Xinyang having the most rainfall at over one hundred and twenty millimeters. In addition, the Huaibei areas of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which are adjacent to Henan, also had rain.

Most of the areas that received rainfall have been lacking rain for a long time. This rainfall is beneficial to the current summer planting and the growth of spring-sown crops. Currently, these areas are seizing the opportunity to rush planting while the soil is moist.

In some parts of the Shandong Peninsula and near Xinyang in Henan, where the rainfall was heavier, torrential rains have continued for four days, and flood peaks have already appeared in the main and tributary rivers of the Huai River.

Currently, southwestern Hebei, southwestern Shandong, and central and northern Henan are still lacking rain. These areas are still vigorously fighting drought to sow seeds and protect seedlings.

    冀鲁豫部分地区喜雨
    各地正抓紧时机趁墒抢种
    新华社28日讯　27日上午八时到28日上午八时二十四小时内，山东中部和东部，河北平原中部和北部，以及河南南部都下了雨。这场雨对于缓和这些地区的旱情是有利的。
    河北平原中北部一般雨量在十到二十毫米之间。其中以沧县降雨三十毫米，保定四十五毫米，遵化七十二毫米为较大。山东济南附近以北地区仅降雨三到八毫米，但山东东南部和山东半岛一般降雨三十到五十毫米，其中威海降雨达九十六毫米。河南南部一般降雨二十到五十毫米，其中信阳降雨达一百二十多毫米，是这次下雨最大的地方。此外，与河南相邻的安徽、江苏两省淮北地区也下了雨。
    这次下雨地区绝大部分久已缺雨。这场雨对当前的夏种和春播作物生长都有一定好处。现在，这些地区都在抓紧时机，趁墒抢种。
    这次下雨较大的山东半岛部分地区和河南信阳附近地区，四天以来连降暴雨，淮河干支流已经出现了洪峰。
    目前，河北西南部、山东西南部和河南中部、北部仍然缺雨。这些地区仍在大力抗旱播种和抗旱保苗。
