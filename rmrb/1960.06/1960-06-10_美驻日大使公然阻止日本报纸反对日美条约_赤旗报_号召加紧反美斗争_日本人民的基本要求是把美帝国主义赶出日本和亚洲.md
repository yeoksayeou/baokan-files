Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: "Akahata" published an editorial today stating that millions of Japanese people now clearly recognize their two main enemies: U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Japanese reactionaries.

The editorial pointed out that the struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government is rapidly developing into a struggle against U.S. imperialism. This is a major ideological development for the Japanese people, and it will lay a solid foundation for their future struggles.

The editorial, in criticizing U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II for publicly interfering with Japanese newspapers opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, said that such behavior should remind the Japanese people that U.S. imperialists are determined to interfere in Japanese affairs.

The editorial called on Japan's democratic forces to rely on the power of the people to openly declare war on U.S. imperialism, to intensify the struggle against U.S. interference in Japan's internal affairs and against Eisenhower's visit, and to further strengthen the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and for the withdrawal of U.S. Black Cat Squadron spy planes from Japan. The editorial called for further development among the people of the movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan, the removal of U.S. military bases, and the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan.

The editorial concluded by saying that the basic demand of the Japanese people is to get the American devils out of Japan and out of all of Asia.
