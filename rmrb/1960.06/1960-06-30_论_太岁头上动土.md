　　On "Moving Earth on the Head of Tai Sui"
　　Fan Xing
　　"Who dares to move earth on the head of Tai Sui?" This shows that "Tai Sui" is an extremely powerful and fierce thing that no one can move; if you do, you will bring bad luck on yourself.
　　What is "Tai Sui"? Scholars might as well study it. It seems that this thing appeared very early in Chinese books. The "Erya" already has the saying "Tai Sui is in Jia" and "Tai Sui is in Yin." It is said to be a star in the sky, and the direction it is in is the ominous direction. When "Tai Sui" is in charge, people cannot move earth, build houses, get married, or even move their homes. If you do these things, it is called offending "Tai Sui," and you will be injured even if you don't die. It can be seen that it is really powerful.
　　However, there are always tough guys who do not believe in "Tai Sui" and are not afraid of offending "Tai Sui." More than 1,800 years ago, Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty wrote many books that broke superstitions and "hated falsehoods." He specially wrote an article called "Discourse on the Year Star," stating that this is "the dangerous heart of vulgar people, who like to believe in taboos." He simply did not admit that there was such a thing as "Tai Sui" in the world, saying that it was just "a name accumulated by the sun and the moon, why should it be a god?" "There is really no misfortune, but it is a false prohibition of north and south, isn't it absurd!"
　　However, even today, some people still believe that there is some "Tai Sui" on their heads, "either in the east and west of people, or in the north and south of people, not in the sky, but on the ground, not now, but in ancient times, not on the top of the head, but in the brain," there is always something "Tai Sui" placed there, making themselves shrink back and dare not move. If someone next to him shouts: There is no "Tai Sui," you can move around. He would also be frightened and pale, his limbs weak, and his mouth shivering: "Who dares to move earth on the head of Tai Sui?"
　　"Tai Sui" is just a "taboo," and "vulgar people" are just some fools who believe in gods and ghosts. It seems very ridiculous. "There is no one who is not hurt, regardless of whether they are facing east, west, south or north." How can there be such a thing in the world, and how can there be such superstitious fools? However, this kind of "taboo" does exist, and this kind of "vulgar people" also exist. Engels analyzed all the religions and superstitions in the world and said that all religions and superstitions are a fantastic reflection in people's minds of the external forces that dominate them. This external force was originally nature, and then "social forces appeared." People also thought that this "social force" was dominating them and was irresistible, just like when they first saw natural forces that they could not understand. In this way, the natural attributes of God are combined with social attributes, and it becomes "an almighty God" (see "Anti-Dühring").
　　This means that the content or object of superstition is not only natural forces, but also social forces.
　　In foreign countries, this thing with both natural and social attributes is called "God." Similarly, in China, there is also such a thing with both natural and social attributes, which should probably be called "Tai Sui." However, I don't know when the Chinese "Tai Sui" went abroad and studied abroad, bringing back a foreign flavor. It was originally a local "Tai Sui," but now it also serves as a foreign "Tai Sui," holding two positions at once. There are many people who believe in both local "Tai Sui" and foreign "Tai Sui," not only the monks, Taoists, bishops, priests, and pastors who believe in ghosts and gods—now called religious professionals—but also some people who do not believe in ghosts and gods but believe in "taboos." These are Wang Chong's so-called "vulgar people."
　　Most of these "vulgar people" are people with knowledge or other spiritual property. Because they have spiritual property, they like to believe in "taboos." Those who do not believe in taboos cannot be called "vulgar people." Those who do not believe in "taboos" and are not afraid of "Tai Sui" are mostly poor and blank "paupers" because "poverty leads to change."
　　"Vulgar people" and "paupers" are representatives of two kinds of thoughts and two kinds of worldviews. "Vulgar people" like to believe in taboos, while "paupers" do not believe in taboos; "vulgar people" have a "Tai Sui" on their heads, either a local "Tai Sui" or a foreign "Tai Sui," while "paupers" have no "Tai Sui" on their heads: speaking, walking, moving, getting married, and even revolution or productive labor, they dare to think, dare to say, and dare to do, and do not believe in things like "resisting Tai Sui is ominous" or "harming by touching it."
　　"Who dares to move earth on the head of Tai Sui?" This is the thinking and saying of the "vulgar people." You say that the literary heritage of China and foreign countries should be accepted critically, and the vulgar people will be frightened when they hear it: they are the highest peak of human culture, too high to reach, and your own literary works are still far behind them, but you criticize them, isn't this "moving earth on the head of Tai Sui?" Literary heritage, whether it is from the feudal landlord class or the bourgeoisie, seems to be the "Tai Sui" in charge in the eyes of these people, and cannot be touched.
　　If you say that in philosophy, you want to criticize the idealist masters Hegel and Kant, what about it? Anyone who has studied the philosophy of these two masters, as long as they hear you mention the names of these two people, will be at a loss and frightened, and hurriedly wave their hands to persuade: Didn't Marx say that there is a "rational kernel" in Hegel's dialectics? Didn't Engels also praise Kant's "General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens" for "opening the first gap in the rigid view of nature"? If you criticize them, aren't you "moving earth on the head of Tai Sui?"
　　In natural science, although there are also local "Tai Sui," they are not eye-catching, but there are thousands of foreign "Tai Sui." Newton's mechanics and Morgan's genetics, one is the "Tai Sui" in physics, and the other is the "Tai Sui" in biology. Who dares to move earth "on the head of Tai Sui?"
　　There are also "Tai Sui" in pedagogy or teaching methods. The local ones have been discarded, but the foreign "Tai Sui" are still in charge. A "great pedagogy" authority, Comenius, is difficult for you to surpass his greatness. His "principle of proportion," is the "Tai Sui" in teaching, dare you move earth on the "head of Tai Sui?"
　　There are also many "Tai Sui" in production technology. The first Tai Sui is foreign machines, and foreign machines have also become "Tai Sui." It is true that foreign machines have high production efficiency, but can we go further and carry out some technological innovations and technological revolutions to improve efficiency even more? The "vulgar people" will come out and wave their hands to stop: This is the latest scientific and technological achievement of others, and the efficiency has already reached the maximum limit. Others can only reach this level, but you insist on higher, isn't this "moving earth on the head of Tai Sui?"
　　In addition to large-scale foreign steelmaking, is it okay to use small-scale foreign or local steelmaking to produce more? No, large-scale foreign steelmaking has high output and low cost. Your small foreign groups or small local groups are "backward" production methods, "not worth the loss," how can they catch up with it? Large-scale foreign steelmaking furnaces have also become the "Tai Sui" on the heads of the "vulgar people," and cannot be touched.
　　Natural science must be learned, but natural science is not the stars and moon in the sky, but grows from the land. Although we don't understand botany, soil science, chemistry, zoology, or genetics, can we develop agricultural production, increase the output of agriculture and animal husbandry, and carry out some agricultural and animal husbandry technical reforms based on the experience and energy of a group of peasant experts? I personally heard an agricultural science expert talk eloquently: "Science is science after all, and reckless actions are not allowed." Science is the "Tai Sui" in agricultural production. There are many "Tai Sui," and there seem to be many "vulgar people" who dare not move earth on the "head of Tai Sui."
　　Chairman Mao used the language of the masses to call all those who do not believe in "taboos" and dare to think, dare to say, and dare to do "paupers," and said that there are 600 million "paupers" in China. In his short article "Introducing a Cooperative," Chairman Mao explained the benefits of poverty and blankness: "Poverty leads to change, wanting to work, wanting to make revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burdens, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures."
　　What is a "burden?" The burden is the "Tai Sui" on the heads of the "vulgar people" mentioned earlier. Without a burden, they are people who do not have "Tai Sui" on their heads, so they naturally dare to think, dare to say, and dare to do, and are not afraid of "Tai Sui being ominous, and being burdened by Tai Sui is also ominous." They not only do not believe in any "Tai Sui," but also do not believe in the ancient truth that "chicken feathers cannot fly to the sky." They adopt a "hating falsehood" attitude towards all the taboos of the "vulgar people," and like Wang Chong, they scold: "Isn't it absurd!"
　　Of course, today's "paupers" would not say anything as elegant as "Isn't it absurd!" In their tone, they would probably say: What nonsense about not being able to move earth on the head of Tai Sui, we must move it and see!
　　Wang Chong was probably the first person in Chinese history to make things difficult for "Tai Sui," so he wrote "Discourse on the Year Star." He not only did not believe in gods and ghosts, but also did not believe in any "Tai Sui" with natural or social attributes. The Han Dynasty was an era of exclusive reverence for Confucianism and dismissal of other schools of thought, but he wrote many articles criticizing Confucian books and Confucianism, "Questioning Confucius," "Criticizing Han Fei," and "Stabbing Mencius," criticizing these three "sages" by name. He said: "Scholars in the world like to believe in teachers and admire the ancients, thinking that what the sages said is all true, and they specialize in lecturing and learning, without knowing how to ask questions." So he raised many questions, stripping the "words of the sages" beyond recognition.
　　He was just a small official, a poor scholar, and although he denied the existence of "Tai Sui," he lived to be seventy-three years old before he died. "Tai Sui" could do nothing to him.
　　Counting the historical figures, philosophers, writers, historians, and scientists in China and foreign countries, no matter which line, which industry, or which discipline, there are a large number of "paupers" who do not believe in "taboos" and are not afraid of moving earth on the head of Tai Sui. However, no matter how many superstitions the "paupers" in history have broken and how much earth they have dug on the head of "Tai Sui," they are not comparable to the emergence of talents from the 600 million liberated paupers in China today. Wang Chonglun, a technician who had only read five years of books, dared to race against time; Cai Zuquan, a worker technician who had only read three years of books, became an expert in the manufacture of high-vacuum precision instruments; Sun Shougang, a twenty-one-year-old laboratory worker, made high-quality silica gel; Li Shimei, a rural youth with only a junior high school education, became a termite expert and a professor at Zhongshan University; Wang Zhihai, a cowherd and technician who had only read two years of books, became a technician in an agricultural research institute after liberation and revealed the overwintering secrets of the rice pest brown planthopper, overturning the conclusions of foreign authoritative entomologists who had studied for fourteen years; Zhou Hanhua, a twenty-three-year-old young farmer who had only read four years of books, used distant hybridization of rice and sorghum to experiment with five excellent rice varieties. This is not only an extraordinary creation in agriculture, but also, and most importantly, it broke the long-term "taboo" of genetics. Biological organisms cannot be hybridized at a distance, which is a "Tai Sui" in biology, and this "Tai Sui" was not only moved but also uprooted by a twenty-three-year-old farmer.
　　There are so many "paupers" like this who break superstitions and move earth on the head of "Tai Sui" that we can't count them all.
　　One type of people is the so-called "vulgar people," who like to believe in "taboos" and "touch people in all directions," and dare not move any earth on the "head of Tai Sui," so they shrink their limbs, lower their heads and necks, and dare not think, say, move, or do anything. Why is this? Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave a very true description of these people. He said: "The mental state of many people still bears the imprint of the oppressed, and their minds are still filled with various superstitions, fears, and inferiority complexes. They are not going all out, but are depressed; they are not striving to move upward, but are content to be in the lower reaches."
　　Another type of people is the 600 million "paupers" mentioned by Chairman Mao. They not only do not believe in taboos, but also dare to move earth on the "head of Tai Sui," and are also able to move earth on the "head of Tai Sui." They move it without any "misfortune," and are not afraid of any "misfortune." Why is this? Chairman Mao answered this question in an editor's note in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside":
　　"Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not avoid problems, but will solve them with a positive attitude, and any human difficulties can always be solved."
　　Can earth be moved on the head of Tai Sui? I say: The "vulgar people" who like to believe in taboos cannot move earth; the "paupers" who do not believe in taboos can move earth, and can also completely dig out the "Tai Sui" on their heads! Don't Marx and Engels have these two famous sayings in the "Communist Manifesto?"
　　"The proletarians have nothing to lose in this revolution but their chains. They have a world to win."
　　If the "vulgar people" who like to believe in taboos want to be able to move earth on the "head of Tai Sui," I think there is only one condition, that is, to kick over a few "Tai Sui" in their minds first.

    论“太岁头上动土”
    繁星
      “谁敢在太岁头上动土”？可见“太岁”是个极厉害、极凶恶的东西，谁都动不了它；如果动了，就会自己倒霉。
    “太岁”是个什么东西，考据家们倒不妨去考证考证。看来这东西在中国的书上出现得很早，《尔雅》上就有“太岁在甲”、“太岁在寅”的说法。据说它是天上的一颗星，它所在的方位，就是凶方，“太岁”当头，人们动不得土，盖不得房屋，不能结婚成亲，连家也搬不得。倘使干了这些，就叫冲犯了“太岁”，不死亦伤。可见它实在厉害。
    但是也有始终不相信“太岁”，不怕冲撞“太岁”的硬汉子。一千八百多年前，东汉有个王充，写过很多破迷信，“疾虚妄”的书，他就专门写过一篇文章，叫《难岁篇》，开宗明义，说这是“俗人险心，好信禁忌。”干脆不承认世界上有“太岁”这个东西，说它不过是“日月积聚之名耳，何故有神”？“实无凶祸，而虚禁南北，岂不妄哉”！
    但是，直到今天，还有人总相信自己的头上有什么“太岁”，“或在人之东西，或在人之南北，不在天上，就在地下，不是今时，就是古代，不是在头顶上，就是在脑袋中，总有个什么“太岁”摆在那里，使自己手足蜷缩，不敢动弹。如果有人在旁大喝一声：没有什么“太岁”，你尽管走动走动吧。他也会吓得面无人色，四肢发软，嘴里打着哆嗦：“谁敢在太岁头上动土”？
    “太岁”不过是个“禁忌”，“俗人”不过是些迷信神鬼的傻瓜，看来都是很可笑的。“无从横负乡（向），皆中伤焉”，世界上哪有这样一个东西，又哪有这样迷信的蠢人？但是这种“禁忌”确实有，这种“俗人”也确实存在。恩格斯把世界上的一切宗教和迷信作过一番分析，说一切的宗教、迷信，都是支配着人们的外界力量，在人们头脑中的一个幻想的反映。这种外界力量，最初是自然界，随后“出现了社会力量”。对这种“社会力量”，人们也像当初看见自然力量无从索解一样，以为是它支配着人，是不可抗御的。这样就使神的自然属性同社会属性综合为一体，变成了“一个万能之神的上帝”（见《反杜林论》）。
    这就是说，迷信的内容或对象不只有自然力量，而且还有社会力量。
    在外国，这个有自然属性又兼有社会属性的东西，叫“上帝”。同样的，在中国也有这样一个兼有自然属性和社会属性的东西，恐怕就得称为“太岁”。不过不知道中国的“太岁”什么时候出过洋、留过学，带回了一身洋气，本来是个土“太岁”，现在也身兼洋“太岁”，一身二任。相信土“太岁”也相信洋“太岁”的人很不少，不但有迷信鬼神的和尚、道士、主教、神甫、牧师——现在称为宗教职业者，而且也有一些虽不迷信鬼神，却迷信“禁忌”的人，这是王充的所谓“俗人”。
    这类“俗人”多数是有学问或有其他精神财产的人。因为他们有精神财产，所以好信
  “禁忌”。不信禁忌的不能叫“俗人”。凡是不信“禁忌”，不怕“太岁”的人，大抵是些一穷二白的“穷棒子”，因为“穷则思变”。
      “俗人”和“穷棒子”是两种思想和两种世界观的代表者。“俗人”好信禁忌，“穷棒子”不信禁忌；“俗人”头上都有个“太岁”，或者是土“太岁”，或者是洋“太岁”，而“穷棒子”的头上却什么“太岁”都没有：说话、走路、搬家、结婚以至革命或生产劳动，他们都敢想、敢说、敢干，不相信什么“抵太岁之冲”，“触而为害”。
      “谁敢在太岁头上动土？”这就是“俗人”们的想法和说法。你说中国和外国的文学遗产都要批判地接受，俗人们一听就吓慌了：它们是人类文化的最高峰，高不可攀，你们自己的文学作品，离开它们还差十万八千里，却批判人家，这不是“太岁头上动土”？文学遗产，不论是封建地主阶级的，还是资产阶级的，在这些人的眼中看来，都是当头的“太岁”，动不得土。
    如果说，在哲学上要批判唯心主义的大师黑格尔和康德，怎么样呢？凡是学过这两位大师的哲学的，只要听你一提这两人的姓名，就手足失措，心惊胆裂，赶忙摇手劝说：马克思不是说过黑格尔的辩证法中也有“合理的内核”，恩格斯不是也赞美过康德的“一般自然历史和天体理论”，“把僵硬的自然观打开第一个缺口”吗？你去批判他们，不是在“太岁头上动土”？
    在自然科学上，土“太岁”虽也有，但是看不入眼，洋
  “太岁”却成千上万。牛顿的力学，摩尔根的遗传学，一个是物理学上的“太岁”，一个是生物学上的“太岁”，“太岁头上”谁敢动土？
    教育学或教学方法上也有“太岁”，土的已经丢弃了，洋的“太岁”却还在当头。一个“大教育学”的权威作者夸美纽斯，你就难以超过他的伟大。他的一条“量力性原则”，就是教学上的“太岁”，你敢在“太岁”头上去动土？
    生产技术上的“太岁”，也多得很，头一个太岁是洋机器，洋机器也成了“太岁”。洋机器生产效率高，是不错的，是不是还可以百尺竿头，再闹点技术革新、技术革命，把效率提得更高一些呢？“俗人”们会出来摇手劝止：这是人家最新的科学技术成就，效率已经是最高限度了，人家只能达到这个程度，你偏要求更高，这不是“太岁头上动土”？
    大型洋法炼钢之外，也用点小型洋法或者土法炼钢，可以多炼些，行不行呢？那不行，大型洋法炼钢，产量高，成本低，你的小洋群或小土群是“落后”的生产方法，“得不偿失”，怎能赶得上它？大型洋法炼钢炉，也成了“俗人”们头上的“太岁”，动不得土。
    自然科学是要学的，但是自然科学不是在天上的星星和月亮，而是从土地上长出来的。虽然不懂得植物学、土壤学、化学、动物学、遗传学，但是凭一群农民土专家的经验和干劲，是不是也可以发展农业生产，提高农牧业的产量，进行一些农牧业的技术改革呢？我亲耳听过一位农业科学专家口沫横飞地侃侃而谈：“科学到底是科学，蛮干是不行的”。科学是农业生产上的“太岁”。“太岁”多得很，不敢在
  “太岁”头上动土的“俗人”也似乎多得很。
    毛主席采用群众的口语，把一切不信“禁忌”，敢想、敢说、敢干的人称为“穷棒子”，说中国有六万万个“穷棒子”。毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》的短文中，解释穷和白的好处是：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图”。
    什么是“负担”？负担就是前面说过的，“俗人”们头上的“太岁”。没有负担，就是头上没有“太岁”的人，自然敢想敢说敢干，不怕“抵太岁凶，负太岁亦凶”。他们不但不相信什么“太岁”，而且不相信“鸡毛不能上天”这个古代真理。他们对一切“俗人”们的禁忌，采取“疾虚妄”的态度，像王充一样，斥道：“岂不妄哉”！
    当然，现在的“穷棒子”不会这样文绉绉的说什么“岂不妄哉”。照他们的口吻，大约是说：什么太岁头上不能动土废话，偏要动动看！
    王充恐怕是中国历史上第一个跟“太岁”为难的人，所以他写《难岁篇》。他不但不信神和鬼，连任何有自然属性或社会属性的“太万岁”都不信。汉朝是独尊儒学，罢黜百家的时代，他却一连写了好多篇非难儒书、儒学的文章，“问孔”、“非韩”、
  “刺孟”，是提名指姓的批驳这三位“圣贤”。他说：“世儒学者，好信师而是古，以为贤圣所言，皆无非专精讲习，不知难问”。所以他提出许多问难，把“圣贤之言”，剥得不成样子。
    他不过是个小官吏，穷书生，虽否定过“太岁”的存在自己倒也活到七十三岁才死。
  “太岁”都拿他无可奈何。
    算算中国的和外国的历史人物，哲学家、文学家、史学家、科学家，无论哪一行、哪一业、哪一学科，不信“禁忌”，不怕在太岁头上动土的“穷棒子”，真可以数出一大批。但是不论历史上的“穷棒子”，破除了多少迷信，在“太岁”头上挖动了多少土，总比不上今日中国六万万翻了身的穷棒子人才辈出。只读过五年书的技工王崇伦，敢和时间赛跑；只读过三年书的工人技术员蔡祖泉，成了高真空精密仪器制造的专家；二十一岁的化验工孙守纲，制成质量优越的矽胶；不过初中程度的农村青年李始美，成了白蚁专家、中山大学的教授；只读过两年书的看牛娃和技工王治海，解放以后，在一个农业研究所当技工，竟揭开水稻害虫褐飞虱的越冬秘密，把外国权威的昆虫学家研究了十四年的结论，一举推翻；二十三岁的青年农民周汉华，只读过四年书，用水稻同高粱远缘杂交，试验出五个优良水稻品种。这不但是农业上的非凡的创造，而且最重要的是打破了遗传学的长期“禁忌”。生物不能远缘杂交，这是生物学中的一个“太岁”，而这个“太岁”被一个二十三岁的农民不仅动了它的土，而且挖了它的根。
    像这样打破迷信、在“太岁”头上动土的
  “穷棒子”，我们实在太多，多得数不尽。
    一种人，就是所谓“俗人”，好信“禁忌”，“东西南北，皆逢触人”，不敢在“太岁”头上动任何一点土，因此蜷着四肢，低头缩颈，什么事都不敢想、不敢说、不敢动、不敢干。这是为什么呢？刘少奇同志对这些人作过很真切的描绘。他说：“不少人的精神状态还带着被压迫者的烙印，头脑里还装满了种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感。他们不是鼓足干劲，而是萎靡不振，不是力争上游，而是甘居下游。”
    另一种人，就是毛主席所说的六万万“穷棒子”，他们不但不信禁忌，而且敢在“太岁”头上动土，也能够在“太岁”头上动土，动了，也毫无“凶祸”，也不害怕什么“凶祸”。这是为什么呢？毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》这本书中的一段按语，回答了这个问题：
    “社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的”。
    太岁头上能不能动土呢？我说：好信禁忌的“俗人”是不能动土的；不信禁忌的“穷棒子”，就能够动土，而且能够把头上的“太岁”，根本挖掉！马克思和恩格斯所写的《共产党宣言》，不是有这么两句名言吗？
    “无产者在这革命中只会失去自己颈上的一条锁链。他们所能获得的却是整个世界”。
    好信禁忌的“俗人”们要能够在“太岁”头上动土，我看只要一条，就是在头脑里先踢翻几个“太岁”。
