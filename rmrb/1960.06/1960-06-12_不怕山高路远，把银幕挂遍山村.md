Not Afraid of High Mountains and Long Distances, Hanging Screens All Over Mountain Villages
Representative of the Film Projection Team of the Yao Autonomous County of Da Yao Mountain, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Chen Yongfa

I come from Da Yao Mountain. Da Yao Mountain is a Yao autonomous county in Guangxi. The area is vast, four hundred li long and two hundred li wide, full of towering mountains. The county has a population of more than 36,000, living very scattered. There are Yao, Zhuang, and Han nationalities, and more than ten kinds of dialects, such as Chashan Yao, Shanzi Yao, Hualanyu Yao, Panyao Yao, ? Yao, Zhuang, Hakka, Pingnan, and Mengshan. Before liberation, the masses had never seen a movie. After liberation, although there was a projection team, it was not widely seen due to inconvenient transportation and scattered residences. Moreover, due to language reasons, most of the masses did not understand it after watching it. Now all villages with more than 100 people have projection points. In 1959, each person could see more than ten films on average. Through the efforts of the film team, the masses can basically understand the content of the films.

Being Able to Let the Masses See Movies Is Our Greatest Pleasure

In order to meet the masses' demands for cultural life, our film team comrades often fight against the natural environment of high mountains, deep water, and unpredictable climate, overcoming the difficulties of inconvenient transportation. Every time we change spots, we often have to carry machines to climb mountains and wade through water for forty or fifty li, and the far ones have to walk seventy or eighty li. In some areas, because the mountains are high and the roads are narrow, we cannot walk while carrying the machines, so we have to disassemble the machines into several parts and carry them on our backs to climb the mountains; sometimes when we encounter dangerous cliffs and steep walls, we have to cut trees to build bridges and pass the machines piece by piece; some big mountain slopes are too steep, so we have to dig mud steps first when going uphill, and push the machines up step by step. Although this is very hard, the comrades often say:
	"Being able to let the masses see movies is our greatest pleasure." Last winter, we went to Nalitun in the remote Luoxiang Commune to show a film, which required walking more than eighty li of mountain roads. This area is full of dangerous cliffs and dense forests. Because we were not familiar with the road, we got lost. At this time, a strong wind blew and it started to rain heavily. We were forced to spend the night in the deep mountains. The wind and rain were heavy, and we were cold and hungry. When we arrived at the projection point the next night, we saw that the masses from nearby villages had already come from ten or twenty li away waiting to see the movie. The comrades immediately hung up the screen and installed the machines to show the film, regardless of hunger and fatigue. When the masses learned that the film team comrades had gotten lost in the deep mountains yesterday, endured the rain and dew, and rushed here to show the film to the masses without even eating, everyone was deeply moved and took meat and vegetables to treat the film team. Yao old grandpa Tao Shanmei said to us with emotion: "You are really good cadres of Chairman Mao. You have worked hard so that our Yao family can see movies."

It is not easy for the masses to come to the projection point to watch a movie in Da Yao Mountain because of the inconvenient transportation. Some masses have to climb mountains and cross ridges for ten or twenty li. Based on this situation, in addition to adopting fixed points and routes, and pre-announcing the projection routes and film content to the masses through the production teams, it is more important to earnestly implement the projection plan and keep our word. Every time we change a projection point, we try our best to overcome difficulties and ensure on-time arrival. Of course, it is not easy to do this. Last year, once our film team had to walk more than seventy li of mountain road from Shuiwan to Luoxiang. On the way, we encountered a strong wind and heavy rain, the road was slippery and difficult to walk, and there were mountain floods blocking the way. The comrades and the masses carrying the machines still endured the biting cold wind, braved the rapid current, and used their heads to carry the machines across the river to rush to the projection point to show the film. Because we have always adhered to the planned projection and kept our word, we have gained credibility among the masses, so many viewers come to every projection point. In order to take care of the audiences who come from far away, we often mobilize students and the masses through local cadres to give up part of the beds for them to stay in.

Everyone Learns Ethnic Languages and Sings Folk Songs Everywhere

There was a period when the number of people watching movies at some projection points decreased because the masses could not understand the words in the movies and could not understand the content. It was also found that many viewers left halfway. For example, when "The Gooseherd Boy Ma Ji" was shown in Liuduan Brigade, Jinxiu Commune, most of the audience left halfway. The comrades didn't know what was going on and were very anxious. After investigation and visits, it turned out that the masses liked to watch movies at the beginning mainly because they thought the movies were rare, could walk and talk, but because they didn't understand the content, they gradually found it tasteless after watching too much. We held a meeting to study these problems and believed that the main reason was that the propaganda work was not done well and the masses could not understand it. In Da Yao Mountain, where the language is relatively complex, to make the masses understand the movies, we must first solve the ethnic language problem in the propaganda work. Among the six comrades in our two teams, only one is Yao and one is Zhuang, and they only know one language of their own ethnic group. The only way is for everyone to learn. Therefore, a climax of learning ethnic languages was set off in the film team. Everyone learned, and learned everywhere. We asked the masses to teach us during rest, and asked the masses carrying the machines to teach us on the way to the transfer point. Sometimes we used ethnic languages to promote exercises against the mountains. The comrades also tested each other, and some comrades also used the phonetic alphabets learned in school to record the Yao language to help them remember. After a period of hard study, the comrades in our projection team can generally use three or four ethnic languages to explain the films and promote the central work. Later, when "The Gooseherd Boy Ma Ji" was shown in Liuding Brigade, Sanjiao Commune, because we could promote and explain it in ethnic languages along with the plot of the film, not only did the masses not leave halfway, but also when they saw the scene of Ma Ji fighting the landlord, they also shouted to fight along with it.

While learning ethnic languages, we deeply understand the folk singing forms that each ethnic group likes. For example, the Zhuang and Yao people like to sing mountain songs, and the Chashan Yao people like to sing tunes and fisherman's drums, etc., so we actively learn from the masses and veteran artists of various ethnic groups, and carefully record the music scores and lyrics for research, so that the propaganda forms are diversified and the masses like to hear and listen to them. After hard study and practice, we can now generally use various ethnic mountain songs and colorful tunes, allegro, fisherman's drums, linglingluo, cross talk, small singing, recitation poems and other diverse literary and artistic forms to promote films and central work. Sometimes after the performance, the masses in the audience also sang along, forming a pre-screening mountain song party. In some areas, the masses still sing the mountain songs compiled by our film team during production. In 1959, the two teams compiled a total of 695 propaganda films and central work song and other singing materials, and compiled 55 sets of slides.

Let the Masses Understand the Movies and Promote Production

The comrades not only pay attention to the diversification of propaganda forms, but also emphasize the ideological content and propaganda effect of propaganda. When the central work arrives in each period, we take the initiative to ask the Party committee for instructions on propaganda work, and earnestly study the documents. When going to communes or brigades to show films, as soon as we arrive at the projection point, we first ask the Party committee for instructions on the propaganda work for that night. Sometimes the projection point is not where the Party committee and branch are located, and even if we have walked dozens of miles that day, we don't care about sore feet and hunger, and we have to climb mountains and ridges to find the Party branch secretary. For example, in July last year, we went from Liubu to Nalai to show a film. We walked more than seventy li of mountain road that day. When we arrived at the projection point, it was already dusk. In order to do a good job in propaganda work, the film team leader did not have time to eat and rest, and ran more than eight li, climbed three mountains, and crossed two rivers to Dadong to ask the Party branch secretary for instructions on the propaganda work. In order to save time, he hurriedly groped in the dark to rush back to the projection point, immediately lit the oil lamp, drew slides, and compiled mountain songs for propaganda until the movie was shown before eating. At the same time, after each screening, we solicit opinions from the Party committee and the masses. We have been doing this all the time for the past two years, so the quality of propaganda has been continuously improved. Because the propaganda work is done well, the masses understand the movies, improve their thinking, and promote production. For example, last spring, the county launched a afforestation campaign, and we focused on "There Are Many Benefits of Forests" as a key film, and cooperated with the screening of propaganda. When screening in Guchen Production Team, Liuxiang Commune, we used slides and local mountain songs that the masses love to sing to promote the benefits of afforestation. After watching the movie, the masses further realized the great significance of afforestation and worked harder. The next day, before dawn, all more than 200 laborers in the team were dispatched to the mountains to plant trees, overfulfilling the afforestation task by more than double. For example, during the busy summer harvest and planting season, "Steel People and Iron Horses" was shown in the Mutual Aid Brigade, combined with encouraging the commune members to learn the steelmaking enthusiasm of the Shanghai workers and big brothers to rush to harvest and plant. After watching it, more than a dozen young people organized a commando team that night and rushed to plant more than five acres of paddy fields under the moonlight.

In addition to using feature films to cooperate with production movements, we also actively select science and education films suitable for local agricultural production for screening and publicity. For example, last summer, after learning that the Guanyinshan Brigade was carrying out corn field management, we took the initiative to ask the film company for "Corn Artificial Pollination" film to cooperate with the screening. The next day, more than 80% of the commune members gave corn artificial pollination, and as a result, a bumper corn harvest was obtained. Before the autumn harvest, the Party committee called for "destroying beasts to protect grain", and the film team selected "Eliminating Harm in the Deep Mountains" film for screening in the Shanjie Production Team to publicize the significance of destroying beasts to protect the harvest, and combined it with introducing local experience in destroying beasts. The next day, when the masses killed a wild boar, they said: "The film team's propaganda is good, and they also deserve credit for killing the wild boar." Although we have transferred the point and left there, they still sent a young man to climb over the mountains for more than thirty miles to send us a few pounds of wild boar meat.

Carry Out Technological Innovation Movement and Improve Projection Quality

Because the projection machines have been used for too long, the projection light is poor, the image is a bit blurred, and the sound is not clear. In order to improve the sound and light quality, ensure safe screening, and make the masses further watch the movies well, we established a technical innovation research group and vigorously launched a technical innovation movement centered on improving the projection quality. According to the characteristics of the film team's work and the use of the machines, we formulated an innovation plan, adopted various methods such as separate activities, centralized learning, and summarizing work, carried out collective research, and repeatedly experimented, forming a technical innovation upsurge in which everyone contributed ideas and everyone took action. In the past year or so, the number of film technical innovation projects has reached as many as 25. The main projects include: successfully trial-producing a projection and recording dual-purpose machine, a horizontal and vertical frame simultaneously moving automatic slide projector, modifying the lens bracket of the Type 54 old projector, and adding six safety devices such as a safety device for the motor capacitor. After this technical innovation, the sound and light quality and the propaganda quality were improved, and the safety screening rate was also improved. In 1959, the safe screening rate was as high as 99.2%, and continuous safe screening reached 573 screenings. There have been no interruptions due to machine accidents in the past two years. In this way, the masses like to watch movies even more.

The above achievements we have made in film technical innovation have not been smooth sailing. For example, we started to conceive and trial-produce a projection and recording dual-purpose machine as early as 1957. We added a recording part to the existing projection machine, so that we can not only play movies but also use local ethnic languages for publicity during screening. After more than a year of experimentation and more than 300 failures, it was finally successfully trial-produced on March 21 this year. Although this machine can only do pre-screening propaganda now, we are further studying it to enable it to provide inter-screening explanations.

The reason why we have achieved these achievements is the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the comrades' resolute implementation of the Party's film work policy of serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants and soldiers. This year, we have mustered greater enthusiasm and realized a good start in the first quarter. The number of screenings increased by 23% compared with the same period last year, and the number of viewers increased by 36%. At the same time, with the continued great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the film industry in Da Yao Mountain has further developed. In addition to adding a commune film team at the end of last year, a new simple cinema was established this year. Under the leadership of the Party, the comrades are holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and striving to achieve a greater leap forward in 1960 and further prosper the cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in Da Yao Mountain!

    不怕山高路远，把银幕挂遍山村
    广西僮族自治区大瑶山瑶族自治县电影放映队代表　陈永发
    我是从大瑶山来的。大瑶山是广西的一个瑶族自治县，地区辽阔，长四百里，宽二百里，到处都是崇山峻岭。全县有三万六千多人口，居住很分散，有瑶、僮、汉三个民族，有茶山瑶话、山子瑶话、花篮瑶话、盘瑶话、?瑶话、僮话、客家话、平南话、蒙山话等十来种方言。解放前，群众从来没有看到过电影。解放后，虽然有了放映队，但由于交通不便，居住分散，看的人并不普遍，而且由于语言的关系，大部分群众看了也不懂。现在达百人以上的村屯都已设了放映点，1959年平均每人可看到十多部影片。经过电影队的努力，使群众也基本上能够看懂了电影的内容了。
    能让群众看到电影，就是我们最大的愉快
    为了满足群众对文化生活的要求，我们电影队的同志经常与山高水深、气候变化无常的自然环境作斗争，克服交通不便的困难。每次转点经常都要带着机器爬山涉水走四、五十里，远的要走七、八十里。有的地区因为山高路窄，抬机器不能走，就得把机器拆开分为几部分，背着爬山；有时遇到险要的悬崖陡壁，就要砍树架桥，把机器一件件地传递过去；有些大山坡度过陡，上山时就要先挖泥级，逐级把机器推上去。虽然这很艰苦，但同志们常这样说：
  “能让群众看到电影，就是我们最大的愉快。”去年冬天，有一次到边远的罗香公社那黎屯去放映，需要走八十多里的山路。这一带都是险要的山崖，森林密布，因为道路不熟，迷失了方向，这时又刮起了大风，下起了大雨，当晚被迫在深山露宿。风大雨大，又冷又饿。第二天晚上到达放映点时，见附近各屯的群众早已从一二十里路赶来等着看电影，同志们不顾饥饿与疲劳，立即挂好银幕，装好机器放映。当群众知道电影队同志昨天在深山迷路，挨雨露宿，赶到这里连饭都未吃就为群众放电影时，大家深为感动，纷纷拿肉和菜来款待电影队。瑶族老爷爷陶善美感动地对我们说：“你们真是毛主席的好干部，为了让我们瑶家能看到电影，辛苦你们了。”
    大瑶山交通不便，群众来放映点看一次电影是不容易的，有些群众要爬山越岭走一二十里路。根据这样的情况，我们除了采取定点定线、提前将放映路线和影片内容通过各生产队向群众预告外，更重要的是认真执行放映计划，说到就到。我们每转一个放映点，都千方百计地克服困难，保证按期到达。当然要做到这一点，也不是容易的。去年，有一次我们电影队从水湾到罗香，要走七十多里山路，行至途中遇狂风暴雨，路滑难行，还有山洪阻挡着去路，同志们和抬机器的群众仍然忍受着刺骨寒风，冒着平胸的急流，用头顶着机器运过河去，赶到放映点放映。由于一贯坚持计划放映，说到就到，在群众中有了信用，因此每到一个放映点观众都来得很多。为了照顾远路来的观众，我们经常通过当地干部动员学生和群众让出一部分的床辅，来给他们住宿。
    人人学民族语言处处学民间歌唱
    有一个时期，群众因听不懂电影里的话，看不懂内容，有些放映点来看电影的人减少了，还发现不少观众在中途退场。如在金秀公社六段大队放映“牧鹅少年马季”时，中途观众走了一大半。同志们不知道是怎么回事，心里很着急，经过调查访问，原来群众开头爱看电影主要是觉得电影稀奇，会走路、会讲话，但因为不懂内容，后来看多了就逐渐觉得无味了。我们针对这些问题开会进行研究，认为主要原因是宣传工作没有做好，群众看不懂。在语言比较复杂的大瑶山，要使群众看懂电影，首先要解决宣传工作当中的民族语言问题。我们两个队六个同志中只有一个是瑶族，一个是僮族，而他们也只会本民族一种语言，唯一办法只有大家学。于是在电影队掀起了学习民族语言的高潮，人人学，处处学，休息时找群众学，转点途中向抬机器的群众学，有时对着山谷用民族语言作宣传演习，同志之间也互相测验，有的同志还用在学校学的拼音字母来记录瑶语，以帮助记忆。经过一段时间的刻苦学习，我们放映队的同志一般都能用三、四种民族语言来解释影片，和对中心工作进行宣传。以后在三角公社六定大队放映“牧鹅少年马季”时，由于能够随着影片的情节用民族语言进行宣传解释，因此群众不但没有中途退场的现象，而且在看到马季打地主这一镜头时，还跟着喊打。
    在学习民族语言的同时，我们深入了解各个民族自己喜爱的民间歌唱形式，如僮族、瑶族爱唱山歌，茶山瑶爱唱调子、渔鼓等等，就积极地向各族群众、老艺人学习，细心地把乐谱、唱词记下来进行研究，使宣传形式多样化，让群众喜闻乐听。经过勤学苦练，现在已能普遍用各民族的山歌和彩调、快板、渔鼓、零零落、相声、小演唱、朗诵诗歌等多种多样的文艺形式，对影片和中心工作进行宣传了。有时演唱之后，全场群众也跟着唱起来，形成了映前山歌会。有的地区群众在生产中还唱着我们电影队所编的山歌。1959年两个队共编写宣传影片和中心工作的山歌等演唱材料六百九十五篇，编制幻灯片五十五套。
    让群众看懂电影　对生产起推动作用
    同志们不但注意宣传形式的多样化，同时还强调宣传内容的思想性和宣传效果。在各个时期中心工作到来时，我们都主动向党委请示宣传工作，并认真学习文件。到公社或大队去放映时，一到放映点首先是找党委请示当晚的宣传工作，有时放映点不是党委和支部所在地，尽管当天走了几十里，也顾不得脚痛肚饿，都要翻山越岭去找党委。如去年7月从六补到那来放映，那天走了七十多里山路，到放映点已是黄昏时候，为了搞好宣传工作，电影队队长来不及吃饭和休息，又跑了八里多路，翻了三个山头，过了两道河，到大垌去找党支书请示宣传工作。为了争取时间，又急忙摸黑赶回到放映点，马上点起油灯，绘制幻灯片，编写山歌进行宣传，直到放映完电影才吃饭。同时每次放映后，都向党委和群众征求意见。两年来一直坚持这样做，所以宣传质量不断地提高。由于宣传工作做得好，群众看懂了电影，提高了思想，对生产起到了推动作用。如去年春天，县里开展造林运动，我们即以“森林好处多”作重点片，配合放映宣传。在六巷公社古陈生产队放映时，运用了幻灯片和当地群众爱唱的山歌，来宣传造林的好处。群众看过电影，进一步认识了造林的重大意义，干劲更足了，第二天天未亮，全队二百多劳动力全部出动上山造林，超额完成造林任务一倍多。又如夏收夏种紧张的时候，在互助大队放映“钢人铁马”，结合鼓励社员学习上海工人老大哥的炼钢干劲来抢收抢插，群众看了之后，当晚就有十多个青年组织突击队，在月光下抢插了五亩多水田。
    除运用艺术片来配合生产运动外，我们还积极选择适合当地农业生产的科教片进行放映宣传。如去年夏天，了解到观音山大队一带正在开展玉米田间管理工作，就主动向影片公司要来“玉米人工授粉”影片配合放映，第二天80％以上的社员都给玉米人工授粉，结果获得玉米丰收。在秋收前，党委号召“灭兽保粮”，电影队就选择了“深山除害”影片在山介生产队放映，向群众宣传灭兽保丰收的意义，并结合介绍当地灭兽经验。第二天群众打得山猪时说：“电影队宣传好，打得山猪也有他们的功劳。”虽然我们已转点离开那里，但他们还是派一个青年翻山越岭赶了三十多里，送几斤山猪肉给我们。
    开展技术革新运动，提高放映质量
    由于放映机器使用时间过长，放映光线差，影象有些模糊，声音不清楚。为了提高声光质量，保证安全放映，使群众进一步看好电影，我们建立了技术革新研究小组，大力开展以提高放映质量为中心的技术革新运动。根据电影队工作的特点和机器使用的情况，订出革新规划，采取分头活动、集中学习、总结工作等各种办法，进行集体研究，反复试验，形成了人人献计、人人动手的技术革新高潮。一年多来，电影技术革新项目达到二十五项之多。其中主要项目是：试制成功了放映录音两用机、横直画幅同时活动自动幻灯机，修改了五四型旧放映机镜头支架，增设了马达电容器的安全器等六项安全设备。经过这次技术革新，提高了声光质量和宣传质量，还提高了安全放映率。1959年安全放映率高达99．2％，连续安全放映达五百七十三场，两年来没有因机器事故而停映过。这样群众对电影就更喜欢看了。
    我们在电影技术革新方面取得以上成绩，并不是一帆风顺的。例如，我们早在1957年就开始设想试制放映录音两用机，在现有放映机器中增加录音部分，放映时既能放电影又能用当地民族语言进行宣传。经过一年多时间的试验和三百多次的失败，终于在今年3月21日试制成功。这个机器，现在虽然还只能作到放映前宣传，但我们正进一步钻研，要使它能够进行映间解说。
    我们所以取得这些成绩，是党的正确领导，和同志们坚决地贯彻执行了党的电影工作为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的方针的结果。今年，我们鼓起了更大的干劲，实现了第一季度的开门红，放映场次比去年同期增加了23％，观众增加了36％。同时，随着工农业继续大跃进，大瑶山的电影事业又有了进一步发展，除去年底增加了一个公社电影队外，今年又新办了一个简易电影院。在党的领导下，同志们正更高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，为实现1960年更大跃进，进一步繁荣大瑶山各族人民的文化生活而奋斗！
