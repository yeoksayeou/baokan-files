　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th. TASS reported from Moscow on the 18th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev said in his reply letter to Reverend Collins, chairman of the "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," that the facts irrefutably prove that the disruption of the Paris Conference was planned and then carried out in advance by the U.S. government, which took a series of measures to this end.

　　On May 20th, Collins wrote to Khrushchev, suggesting that national leaders of all countries study the possibility of "no longer blaming each other," and suggesting that no steps be taken "that might hinder the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests." In addition, Collins asked Khrushchev on behalf of the Soviet government to provide a guarantee that the Soviet Union would not be the first to use nuclear weapons.

　　In his reply on June 13th, Khrushchev emphasized that not exposing the subversive and provocative activities of U.S. military and political figures would be a direct encouragement to the forces of aggression, and the result would inevitably intensify the threat to the cause of peace.

　　When talking about the issue of concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. government's intention to unilaterally resume nuclear weapon tests cannot but make all honest people in the world worry about the fate of future negotiations on this issue. Khrushchev wrote that the impression is now being formed that, both in this negotiation and in the negotiations in the Disarmament Committee, the U.S. government does not want to make progress, but only wants to lead to the breakdown of negotiations, or to bring the negotiations to a standstill indefinitely.

　　In answering Collins' hope that the Soviet Union would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Khrushchev wrote: The Soviet government's position is very clear: we advocate that all countries undertake the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; as long as other countries are willing to do so, we will immediately sign such an agreement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th. TASS reported from Geneva: Soviet delegation leader Zorin condemned the U.S. government's negative stance on the new proposals of the Soviet Union for the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament at the regular meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee on the 17th.

　　Zorin emphasized that it can be seen from the speech of U.S. representative Eaton that the United States opposes the destruction of the tools for transporting nuclear weapons to their destinations, opposes the cancellation of foreign military bases in other countries' territories, opposes the withdrawal of foreign troops from their territories, and fundamentally opposes any thorough disarmament measures. The U.S. delegation actually regards obstructing the progress of comprehensive and thorough disarmament negotiations as its own task. The United States neither wants comprehensive and thorough disarmament, nor does it want the first phase of disarmament measures we have proposed, and it simply does not want any fundamental disarmament measures.

    赫鲁晓夫在给柯林斯的复信中说
    美国企图使裁军谈判破裂
    佐林在裁军会议上揭露美国不想裁军
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给
  “争取核裁军运动”主席柯林斯牧师的复信中说，事实无可辩驳地说明，破坏巴黎会议是美国政府事先策划、然后执行的，它为此采取了一系列的措施。
    5月20日柯林斯写信给赫鲁晓夫，建议各国国家领导人研究“不再互相指责”的可能性，建议不要采取“可能妨碍达成停止核武器试验协定”的任何步骤。此外，柯林斯要求赫鲁晓夫代表苏联政府提出苏联不第一个使用核武器的保证。
    赫鲁晓夫在6月13日的回信中强调指出，不揭露美国军界政界人士的颠复活动和挑衅活动，那将是对侵略势力的直接鼓励，结果势必加剧对维护和平事业的威胁。
    在谈到缔结关于停止核武器试验协定的问题时，赫鲁晓夫指出，美国政府打算单方面恢复核武器试验的做法不能不使全世界一切正直的人耽心今后这个问题的谈判的命运。赫鲁晓夫写道，现在正在形成这样一种印象：即在这个谈判以及在裁军委员会的谈判中，美国政府都不想取得进展，而只想导致谈判的破裂，或者使谈判无限期停滞不前。
    在回答柯林斯希望苏联不要第一个使用核武器的要求时，赫鲁晓夫写道：苏联政府的立场是十分明确的：我们主张各国承担关于各国不第一个使用核武器的义务，只要其他国家愿意这样做，我们立即就在这样的协定上签字。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表团团长佐林17日在十国裁军委员会的例会上谴责美国政府对苏联的全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的新建议采取的否定立场。
    佐林强调指出，从美国代表伊顿的发言中可以看出，美国反对销毁运送核武器到目的地的工具，反对取消别国领土上的外国军事基地，反对撤出它们领土上的外国军队，根本反对任何彻底的裁军措施。美国代表团实际上把阻碍全面彻底裁军谈判的进展看作是自己的任务。美国既不想全面彻底裁军，不要我们所建议的裁军第一阶段的措施，也根本不希望任何根本的裁军措施。
