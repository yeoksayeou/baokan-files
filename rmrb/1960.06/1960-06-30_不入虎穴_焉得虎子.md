    If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs?

    In China's film machinery manufacturing industry, there were many gaps in the past. In recent years, thanks to our boosted energy and liberated thinking, we have manufactured many new products, filling many of these gaps. However, there are still some gaps waiting to be filled, and "stereoscopic cameras" are one of them. Therefore, we must establish lofty ambitions to completely fill the gaps, and achieve what others don't have, we must also have.
    
    When the leadership decided that I should trial-produce a stereoscopic camera, my mood was both happy and fearful. I was happy because I would personally fill this gap, which is an extremely glorious thing; I was fearful because I had never even seen such a product. Could I make it? I really wasn't sure. A passage from Chairman Mao's "On Practice" seemed to be directed at me. He said: "We often hear some comrades say when they are unable to bravely accept work tasks: 'I'm not sure.' Why aren't they sure? Because they don't have a systematic understanding of the content and environment of this work, or they have never been exposed to this type of work, or have not been exposed to it much, so there's no way to talk about the regularity of this type of work." My situation was exactly like this. In the past, when our factory manufactured cameras, we were imitating them, with drawings, technical data, and physical samples. Although there were many difficulties, it was still relatively easy. However, this time, the manufacture of the stereoscopic camera was a huge problem, with no drawings, no technical data, and no physical samples. It was simply "empty-handed." What did a stereoscopic camera look like? I hadn't seen it. What were the regularities of its internal structure? I didn't understand it at all. What to do? Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "If you want to directly understand a certain thing or things, you can only participate in the practical struggle to change reality, change a certain thing or things, in order to touch the phenomenon of that thing or those things, and only by personally participating in the practical struggle to change reality can you expose the essence of that thing or those things and understand them." He also said: "There is an old Chinese saying: 'If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs?' This saying is true for people's practice, and it is also true for epistemology. Knowledge divorced from practice is impossible." Right! To directly acquire the knowledge of manufacturing stereoscopic cameras and manufacture it, you must bravely invest in the practice of trial-producing stereoscopic cameras. Only through practice can you gain experience and knowledge, find regularity, and succeed. That is to say, only by entering the "tiger's den" can you catch the "tiger cub." If you stop in front of the "tiger's den," it is absolutely impossible to get the "tiger cub."
    
    In this way, I boldly began the trial-production work. However, there were indeed many difficulties. At one point, I was somewhat lacking in confidence and couldn't persist. The Party branch secretary saw what I was thinking and said to me: "As long as you have courage and energy, any difficulty can be overcome. Difficulties can be transformed into smoothness, the key is whether you can give play to your subjective initiative." The Party's words greatly encouraged me, greatly increased my courage and strength, and made me deeply believe that as long as I carry out tenacious practice and serious exploration, I will surely succeed. Failure is nothing, "failure is the mother of success." Experiment, fail, re-experiment, fail again,... until finally achieving success, this is the inevitable law of technological revolution and any cutting-edge product.
    
    However, the biggest and most difficult problem encountered in the trial production was: the interlocking horizontal shaft on the camera must not only move the lenses of the two cameras left and right, but also drive other gears to rotate synchronously, without any deviation. This problem stumped me. A passage from Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" gave me inspiration. Chairman Mao said: "In the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions, and one of them must be the main contradiction, and due to its existence and development, it stipulates or affects the existence and development of other contradictions." Therefore: "We must use all our strength to find its main contradiction. If we grasp this main contradiction, all problems will be solved easily." So where is the main contradiction in manufacturing a stereoscopic camera? I calmly analyzed it and affirmed that it was the position of the "interlocking horizontal shaft." Once, I saw an old master using a compass to draw circles on a workpiece, which touched my "inspiration." I thought that the reason why a circle can be drawn is because one foot of the compass is used as the center. Based on this principle, I determined that the "interlocking horizontal shaft" should be set in the middle of the camera, and the main gearbox should be placed in the center to control the linkage and synchronization of the shaft and gears, as well as the position of the same direction rotation and left and right movement. After many experiments, this key problem was finally solved. After this problem was solved, other problems became easier to handle. Finally, the "stereoscopic camera" was successfully created. After trial use, the quality fully met the requirements and the effect was very good.
    
    From the practice of this stereoscopic camera trial production, I deeply realized the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is truth, is victory. We must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves. In this way, we will surely be able to be invincible in our work and production, and leap forward again and again.

    不入虎穴　焉得虎子
    上海电影机械厂二车间钳工　闵长远
    在我国的电影机械制造工业上，过去有许多的空白点。近几年由于我们鼓足了干劲，解放了思想，制造出了不少新产品，已填补了不少空白。但是，还有一些空白有待于填补，“立体摄影机”就是其中之一。因此我们必须树立雄心大志，把空白完全填补起来，并做到别人没有的，我们也要有。
    当领导上决定由我来试制立体摄影机的时候，我的心情是：又喜又惧。喜的是，这项空白将由我来亲手填补，这是一件无上光荣的事情；惧的是，这种产品，我见都没有见到过。能够把它搞出来吗？实在没有把握。毛主席在《实践论》中说的一段话好像是针对我说的。他说：“常常听到一些同志在不能勇敢接受工作任务时说出来的一句话：没有把握。为什么没有把握呢？因为他对于这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解，或者他从来就没有接触过这类工作，或者接触得不多，因而无从谈到这类工作的规律性。”我的情况正是这样。过去我们厂在制造摄影机时，是仿制的，有图纸、有技术资料、有实样，虽然困难也不少，但毕竟还比较好办。可是，这次立体摄影机的制造，却是一个天大的难题，一无图纸，二无技术资料，三无实样，简直是“赤手空拳”。立体摄影机是什么样子呢？我没有见到过。它的内部结构有什么规律性呢？我更不了解。怎么办呢？毛主席在《实践论》中说：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”他又说：“中国人有一句老话：‘不入虎穴，焉得虎子’，这句话对于人们的实践是真理，对于认识论也是真理。离开实践的认识是不可能的。”对！要直接取得制造立体摄影机的知识，并把它制造出来，就必须勇敢投入试制立体摄影机的实践中去。只有实践，才能取得经验和知识，才能摸出规律性，才能成功。这就是说：只有钻进“虎穴”，才能抓得“虎子”。在
  “虎穴”面前，裹足不前，“虎子”是决不可能到手的。
    就这样，我大胆地开始了试制工作。但是，困难确实是不少。有一度我曾经有些信心不足，有点坚持不下去。党支部书记看出了我的心思，对我说：“只要有勇气和干劲，天大的困难也是可以克服的。困难可以转化为顺利，关键在于你是不是能够发挥主观能动性。”党的话给我极大的鼓舞，大大增添了我的勇气和力量，使我深信，只要进行顽强的实践，认真的摸索，一定会取得成功。失败不算什么，“失败是成功之母”。试验、失败，再试验、再失败，……以至最后取得成功，这是技术革命以及任何尖端产品产生的必然规律。
    但是，在试制中遇到最大的、难于解决的困难是：摄影机上的连锁横轴，既要使两台摄影机镜头左右移动，同时又要联带其他的齿轮同步地转动，其中不能有半点偏差。这个难题，可把我难住了。毛主席在《矛盾论》中的一段话，给了我启发。毛主席说：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”因此：“就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”那末制造立体摄影机的主要矛盾在哪里呢？我冷静地分析了一下，肯定了是“连锁横轴”的位置问题。有一次，我看到老师傅拿着一把圆规在工件上划圆圈，这触动了我的“灵机”。我想圆圈之所以能画出，是由圆规的一个脚作为中心，根据这个原理，我断定“连锁横轴”应设在摄影机的中间，中央放主齿轮箱来控制轴和齿轮连锁和同步，以及同方向的转动和左右移动的位置。经过多次的试验，终于解决了这个关键性的问题。这个问题解决之后，其他问题也就好办了。最后，终于胜利地把“立体摄影机”创制出来了。经过试用，质量完全符合要求，效果很好。
    从这次立体摄影机试制的实践中，我深深体会到，毛泽东思想的伟大力量。毛泽东思想就是真理，就是胜利。我们必须认真地学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装自己。这样，就一定能够使我们在工作中和生产中无往而不胜，跃进再跃进。
