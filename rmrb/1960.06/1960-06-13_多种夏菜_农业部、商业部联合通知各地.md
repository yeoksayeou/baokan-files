Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued a notice on the 11th, requiring all regions to seize the opportunity to grow more summer vegetables and do a good job in supplying vegetables during the peak season. The notice said that the sowing and planting of summer vegetables has now basically ended. Most cities have planted more summer vegetables than last year. However, the completion of summer vegetable sowing plans in various regions is still uneven. Therefore, all regions should immediately organize forces to conduct an inspection of the sowing of summer vegetables. Where the sowing plan has not been completed in a timely manner, land, labor, and other resources must be properly arranged to strive to complete the plan. Where the plan has already been completed, intercropping, interplanting, and mixed cropping should continue to be vigorously carried out to increase the area of multiple cropping.

The notice also requires all regions to promptly carry out watering, fertilization, cultivating and weeding, and disease and pest control for the vegetables that have already been planted. Labor must be unified and properly arranged under the leadership of the Party committee. Agricultural and commercial departments in various regions should also arrange transportation, supply, and processing of vegetables during the peak season. Efforts should be made to actively improve the supply and distribution during the peak season, and to do a good job in drying, pickling, and processing to reserve sources of goods for the off-season.

    多种夏菜
    农业部、商业部联合通知各地
    据新华社讯　农业部、商业部11日发出联合通知，要求各地抓紧时机多种夏菜，做好旺季蔬菜供应工作。通知说，现在夏菜播种定植工作已基本结束，大部分城市已种的夏菜比去年都有增加，但各地夏菜播种计划的完成情况在地区上还不很平衡，因此，各地应立即组织力量对夏菜的播种情况进行一次检查。凡是没有及时完成播种计划的地方，一定要把土地、劳动力等切实安排，力争完成计划；已经完成计划的地方，也应继续大搞间作、套种、混作，增加复种面积。
    通知还要求各地对已种的蔬菜要及时浇水、施肥、中耕除草和防病治虫等工作；一定要在党委领导下，统一安排好劳动力。各地农业和商业部门还应安排好旺季蔬菜运输、供应加工等工作，既要积极搞好旺季的供应、分配工作，又要做好晒干、腌制加工，以便为淡季贮备货源。
