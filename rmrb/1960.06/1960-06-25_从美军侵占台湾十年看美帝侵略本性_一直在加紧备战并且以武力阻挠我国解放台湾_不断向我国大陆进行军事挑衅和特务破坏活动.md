Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: It has been a full ten years since June 27, 1950, when former U.S. President Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy the Taiwan Strait, marking the beginning of U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory, Taiwan. Over the past decade, U.S. imperialism has been intensifying war preparations in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, directly using force to obstruct our people's liberation of Taiwan, and constantly engaging in military provocations against our mainland, threatening our country's security and undermining peace in Asia and the world.

In December 1954, it signed the so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The treaty stipulates that the United States will not only station its naval and air forces in the Taiwan area for a long time, but also deploy ground forces in "Taiwan, Penghu and its vicinity." In February 1955, when our People's Liberation Army liberated islands such as Dachen, Yushan, and Pishan, the United States dispatched a large number of naval vessels to cover and assist the Chiang Kai-shek troops in their retreat, and together with the Chiang army, abducted more than 18,000 residents of Dachen and other islands to Taiwan. The then commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Pride, and others directly participated in this most blatant act of aggression and gangsterism. In August 1958, after the failure of U.S. imperialism's aggression in the Middle East, it created tension in the Taiwan Strait area and seriously threatened our people with war. During the Jinmen炮战 (炮战 literally cannon battle is probably better translated as the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis), the U.S. Seventh Fleet directly invaded our territorial waters to escort the Chiang army. From September 7, 1958, to June 19 this year, a total of 183 U.S. warships of various types have intruded into our territorial waters 90 times, and 254 U.S. aircraft of various types have intruded into our airspace 81 times, totaling 171 times. U.S. aircraft not only intruded into our territorial airspace, but also brazenly intruded into the airspace over our coastal islands, cities, and inland areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces. Most recently, during Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan, U.S. Seventh Fleet warships and aircraft engaged in rampant activities in the Taiwan Strait, carrying out armed intimidation against our people.

U.S. imperialism is attempting to turn Taiwan into a springboard for the United States to prepare and launch aggressive wars in the Far East. It has been accelerating the construction and expansion of air and naval bases in Taiwan. Before 1954, the United States had built air force bases in Taoyuan, Chiayi, Pingtung, Tainan, Hsinchu and other places in Taiwan, and not long ago expanded the Kung Kuan and Songshan air force bases. Recently, the United States has also expanded the Lanyu military airport. The United States has also turned Keelung, Kaohsiung, Magong on the Penghu Islands, Zuoying naval port, and Hualien port into naval bases.

In order to strengthen its military control over Taiwan, U.S. imperialism has established U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, U.S. Seventh Fleet Task Force 72 Command, U.S. Air Force Thirteenth Air Force Forward Command and other military institutions in Taiwan. The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, which specializes in controlling and managing the Chiang Kai-shek army, has been constantly increasing its personnel in recent years, from 54 in 1951 to about 3,000 now. The U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, the unified military command organization in the Taiwan area, not only commands the U.S. army, navy, and air force occupying Taiwan, but also controls the Chiang Kai-shek army. U.S. Seventh Fleet Task Force 72, which specializes in activities in the Taiwan Strait area, frequently intrudes into the waters of Jinmen, Mazu, and Dongyin in our country.

In order to maintain tension in the Far East, U.S. imperialism is stepping up military provocations against our people and constantly conducting military exercises with the Chiang Kai-shek army. In the joint military exercise conducted by the U.S. and Chiang armies from mid-March to early April this year, which lasted for more than 20 days, 50,000 U.S. troops participated. The exercise openly used our country as a hypothetical enemy, with the U.S. Marine Corps "acting as the attackers," fully demonstrating U.S. imperialism's determination to be an enemy of the Chinese people.

The American bandits have also established many spy agencies in Taiwan to collect intelligence on our country's military, political, economic and other aspects, and to carry out sabotage activities against our mainland. In recent years, our public security organs have captured some spies and secret agents of U.S. intelligence agencies who were airdropped or smuggled into our mainland, many of whom were trained in Taiwan by U.S. intelligence agencies.

U.S. imperialism has also been stepping up the arming of Chiang Kai-shek's army in order to use the Chiang army as a tool to attack the Chinese people. According to the Associated Press, the total amount of "military aid" given by the United States to the Chiang gang from 1946 to the present has reached $3,637,810,000. "Military aid" in the last ten years alone accounted for more than $2,560 million. In recent years, in addition to handing over some aircraft and warships to the Chiang army, the United States has also shipped "Nike-Hercules" missiles, "Matador" missiles, and Sidewinder missiles to Taiwan.

Over the past decade, the robber face of the American aggressors has become more and more exposed, which has increasingly aroused the contempt, disdain, and hatred of the great Chinese people. The Chinese people have declared that they must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan, and U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan. This firm will of the 650 million Chinese people can never be intimidated by the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism.

    从美军侵占台湾十年看美帝侵略本性
    一直在加紧备战并且以武力阻挠我国解放台湾
    不断向我国大陆进行军事挑衅和特务破坏活动
    新华社24日讯　从1950年6月27日美国前总统杜鲁门命令第七舰队侵驻台湾海峡那天起，美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾，到现在已整整十年。十年来，美帝国主义一直在台湾和台湾海峡地区加紧备战，直接以武力阻挠我国人民解放台湾，并且不断向我国大陆进行军事挑衅，威胁我国安全，破坏亚洲和世界和平。
    1954年12月和蒋介石集团签订了所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”。条约规定，美国不仅让它的海空军长期驻扎在台湾地区，而且要在“台湾、澎湖及其附近”部署陆军。1955年2月，当我人民解放军解放大陈、渔山列岛、披山岛等岛屿时，美国出动了大量的海军掩护和协助蒋介石军队撤逃，而且和蒋军一起把大陈等海岛一万八千多居民劫往台湾。当时的美国第七舰队司令普赖德等，直接参与指挥了这一最露骨的侵略行动和强盗勾当。1958年8月，美帝国主义在侵略中东失败以后，又在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，向我国人民严重进行战争威胁。在金门炮战中，美国第七舰队又直接侵入我领海，为蒋军护航。从1958年9月7日到今年6月19日为止，计有一百八十三艘各种类型的美国军舰侵入我国领海九十次，二百五十四架各种类型的美国飞机侵入我国领空八十一次，共计一百七十一次。美国的飞机不仅侵入我国领海上空，并且猖狂地侵入我国沿海岛屿、城市以及浙江、福建、江西、广东等省内陆地区上空。最近在艾森豪威尔到台湾“访问”期间，美国第七舰队的军舰和飞机，在台湾海峡猖狂活动，对我国人民进行武装恫吓。
    美帝国主义妄图把台湾变成美国在远东准备和发动侵略战争的跳板。它在台湾加紧修建和扩充了空军和海军基地。1954年前，美国就在台湾的桃园、嘉义、屏东、台南、新竹等地修建了空军基地，不久前又将公馆和松山两个空军基地加以扩建。最近，美国又扩建了兰屿军用机场。美国还把基隆、高雄、澎湖列岛的马公、左营海军军港和花莲港，变为海军基地。
    美帝国主义为了加强对台湾的军事控制，在台湾设立了美国军事援助顾问团、美国台湾防御司令部、美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令部、美国空军第十三航空队驻台前进指挥部等军事机构。专门控制和管理蒋介石军队的美国军事援助顾问团，几年来不断增加人员，从1951年的五十四人增加到现在的三千人左右。美国在台湾地区的军事统一指挥机构——美国台湾防御司令部，不仅统一指挥着侵占台湾的美国陆海空军，并且控制着蒋介石军队。专门活动在台湾海峡地区的美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队，经常侵入我国金门、马祖、东引海域。
    美帝国主义为了在远东保持紧张局势，加紧对我国人民进行军事挑衅，不断同蒋介石军队举行军事演习。今年3月中旬到4月初，美蒋军队举行的为期二十多天的联合军事演习，美军就有五万人参加。演习中公然以我国为假设敌，由美国海军陆战队“充当进攻者”，充分说明美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌。
    美国强盗还在台湾设立了许多特务机关，收集有关我国军事、政治、经济等各方面的情报，对我国大陆进行破坏活动。几年来，我国公安机关捕获了一些在我国大陆空投或偷渡入境的美国情报机构的间谍和特务，其中许多都是在台湾由美国谍报机关训练出来的。
    美帝国主义还为了把蒋军作为进攻中国人民的工具，一直在加紧武装蒋介石的军队。据美联社消息，从1946年到现在，美国给予蒋帮的“军事援助”总数达三十六亿三千七百八一万美元。最近十年来的“军事援助”即占二十五亿六千多万美元。几年来，美国除得一些飞机和军舰交给蒋军外，还把“奈克——赫尔克里士式”导弹、“斗牛士式”导弹和响尾蛇导弹运进台湾。
    十年来，美国侵略者的强盗面目越来越原形毕露，从而也越来越引起伟大的中国人民的蔑视、鄙视和仇视。中国人民已宣布，一定要解放自己的神圣领土台湾，美帝国主义一定要滚出台湾。六亿五千万中国人民的这个坚强意志，绝不是美帝国主义这只纸老虎所能吓倒的。
