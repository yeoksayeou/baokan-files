Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 14th: The Indian Lucknow Hindi "People's Century" weekly published a commentary refuting the recent anti-China remarks made by Indian Home Minister Pant on the Rana Pratap Memorial Day. The commentary said that Pant "is silent about the heinous acts of the imperialists on the one hand, but furious with the socialist countries on the other; he is respectful to the imperialists on the one hand, but enraged with the socialist countries on the other; this shows that he is neither neutral nor prudent."

The commentary pointed out that Pant's statement that a certain country was not unhappy that the Four-Power Summit did not take place "is a deliberate attempt to insult and ridicule China. He wants to say that China does not want peace, does not want to reach an agreement, and China wants quarrels and wars," so it is happy that the Four-Power Summit did not take place.

The commentary refuted that, firstly, such accusations are completely incorrect, not only fundamentally but also from a factual point of view. Many statements by Chinese leaders and newspapers oppose the US undermining the summit. They believe that "the US imperialists, their spy planes, and their President Eisenhower should be held responsible for undermining the summit. They are not the only ones who think so. World opinion believes that Eisenhower is responsible for this."

The commentary also said that, secondly, Pant did not point out that those who were truly happy that the Four-Power Summit did not take place were primarily the American warmonger groups, including Eisenhower.

The commentary, written by Ramesh Sinha, also revealed that the planned anti-China propaganda in India after the US sabotaged the Four-Power Summit was instigated by the US and supported by US funding. The commentary said, "If anyone thinks that all this is not planned, that no one is instigating and funding this behind the scenes, then he is either unfamiliar with the ugly deeds of the Americans, or he is a fool or a hypocrite."

    印度“人民世纪”周刊揭露
    美国出钱支持印度反华宣传
    潘特对帝国主义者毕恭毕敬，对社会主义国家怒气冲冲，这既不中立，也不慎重。
    新华社新德里14日电　印度勒克瑙印地文“人民世纪”周刊刊载了一篇评论，驳斥印度内政部长潘特最近在拉纳·普拉塔普纪念日发表的反华言论。评论说，潘特“一方面对帝国主义者的恶劣行为一声不吭，另一方面却对社会主义国家怒气冲冲，一方面对帝国主义者毕恭毕敬，另一方面却对社会主义国家怒不可遏；这说明既不中立，也不慎重。”
    评论指出，潘特所谓的有一个国家对四国首脑会议开不成并不感到不高兴这句话，“是故意想污辱和揶揄中国的。他是想说，中国不要和平，不想达成协议，中国要争吵和战争”，所以它对四国首脑会议开不成感到高兴。
    评论驳斥说，首先，这种指责不仅从根本上来讲，而且从事实的观点上来讲，都是完全不正确的。中国领袖们和报纸的许多言论，都反对美国破坏最高级会议。他们认为“美帝国主义者、他们的间谍飞机和他们的总统艾森豪威尔应该对破坏最高级会议负责。不只是他们那样认为。全世界舆论都认为艾森豪威尔要对这件事负责。”
    评论又说，其次，潘特没有指出那些对四国首脑会议开不成真正感到高兴的首先是美国的战争贩子集团，包括艾森豪威尔在内。
    这篇由拉梅希·辛哈撰写的评论还揭露，在美国破坏四国首脑会议以后，印度有计划的反华宣传是受美国指使，并得到美国出钱支持的。评论说，“如果有人认为这一切不是有计划的，认为没有人在背后指使和出钱来支持这种事情，那他或者是不熟悉美国人的丑行，或者就是傻瓜或伪君子。”
