    Soviet Scientist Kozyrev Proposes Important Hypothesis
    Time Can Spontaneously Transform into Energy

    Soviet scientist Kozyrev recently proposed a new hypothesis of great scientific significance: time can spontaneously transform into energy.

    The basic content of his new hypothesis is that the transfer of time can become a source of mechanical power. Time can spontaneously transform into energy. It is this energy that enables the universe to maintain the process of "self-preservation."

    Kozyrev believes that the passage of time is not constant in all circumstances. It changes in rotating objects. The transfer of time is faster at the equator of a rotating object than at any other latitude. This difference in the passage of time creates a special type of force, previously unknown to science. In huge rotating objects, such as the Earth, planets, and stars, the flow of time generates considerable energy. According to Kozyrev's calculations, this energy is equivalent to the thermonuclear reactions occurring inside stars.

    A basic principle of thermodynamics states that all processes in nature tend to develop in only one direction, so as to equalize temperatures, thus requiring equilibrium to be established at the lowest level of energy (heat). However, if all processes in the universe could only balance energy towards a low level, then the entire world would have long ago become an ice wasteland. Engels once proposed a hypothesis: the heat emitted into space should be able to be re-concentrated through some means. This is indeed the case. New stars and star clusters are constantly forming in the universe. Kozyrev's hypothesis can explain this phenomenon. According to his hypothesis, there is not only a process of energy dissipation in the universe, but also a process of energy concentration due to the flow of time. The existence of the world is permanently guaranteed because the passage of time drives the permanent circulation of cosmic energy.

    According to Kozyrev, his theory has been partially confirmed. One of the direct conclusions drawn from his theory is that all rotating celestial bodies are in fact heart-shaped. This is because the inward gravitational force of these celestial bodies makes them spherical, the centrifugal force makes their equators bulge, and the poles contract toward flatness. The third force, the "Kozyrev force," draws the mass of the planet or star towards the north, flattening the North Pole and making the South Pole bulge, so that the distance from the South Pole to the equator is greater than the distance from the North Pole to the equator.

    It has now been clarified that the South Pole of the Earth bulges more than the North Pole. Because the Earth's rotation speed is not too high, the North Pole is only flattened by one hundred meters, and the South Pole is only extended by one hundred meters accordingly. However, this effect is more pronounced on some large planets with faster rotation speeds, such as Saturn and Jupiter. Jupiter has a diameter of 140,000 kilometers, and the peripheral speed at the equator is about 25 times that of the Earth. Its North Pole is 210 kilometers closer to the equator than the Earth, and the South Pole is 210 kilometers farther away.

    Kozyrev believes that his theory can be practically applied in many aspects. For example, the fact that most of the denser continents on Earth are in the Northern Hemisphere is due to the "squeezing" effect of this force. The action of this force makes the Northern Hemisphere warmer than the Southern Hemisphere, and so on.

    Professor Kozyrev, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, was the first to discover the phenomenon of lunar volcanic eruptions, negating the idea that the moon is a "dead celestial body." He also discovered auroras on Venus.

### 苏科学家科齐列夫提出重要假说  时间可以自行转变为能量

    苏科学家科齐列夫提出重要假说
    时间可以自行转变为能量
    苏联著名科学家科齐列夫最近提出一个在科学上有重大意义的新假说：时间可以自行转变为能量。
    他的新假说的基本内容是，时间的转移可以成为机械动力的来源。时间可以自行转变为能量。正是由于这种能量，才能使宇宙维持“自我永存”的过程。
    科齐列夫认为，时间的进程不是在任何情况下都是不变的。它在旋转物体中就有变化。时间的转移在一个自转物体的赤道上要比在任何其它纬度为快。时间进程的这种差异，造成了一种特殊类型的力，这是科学上前所未知的。在巨大的自转物体中，如地球、行星和恒星上，时间的流动产生了相当巨大的能量。据科齐列夫计算，这种能量相当于恒星内部发生的热核反应。
    热力学的一条基本原理认为，自然界的一切过程都有仅朝一个方向发展的趋势，以便使温度相等，这样就需要在能量（热量）的最低水平建立平衡。但是，如果宇宙间一切过程都只能使能量向低水平平衡，那么整个世界早已就变成一片冰荒了。恩格斯曾经提出一种假说：向空间发出的热量应该能通过某种途径重新集中起来。事实也是如此。宇宙中经常有新的恒星和星群在形成。科齐列夫的假说就可以解释这种现象。根据他的假说，宇宙中不仅存在着能量消散的过程，而且由于时间的流动而存在能量集中的过程。世界的存在，正是由于时间进程推动了宇宙能量的永久循环，因而得到了永久的保证。
    据科齐列夫的意见，他的理论已经得到某些证实。从他的理论得出的直接结论之一是，所有自转的天体事实上都是心脏形的。这是因为，这些天体的内心引力使它们成为球形，离心力使它们的赤道凸出，而两极收缩趋向于扁平。第三种力，也就是“科齐列夫力”，把行星或恒星的质量引向北方，压扁了北极，而使南极凸出，从而使南极与赤道的距离，大于北极与赤道的距离。
    现在已经阐明，地球南极比北极凸出。由于地球自转速度不是太大，北极只被压扁了一百米，南极也只相应地延伸了一百米。但是，在一些自转速度较快的大行星上，如土星、木星等，这种效应更显著。木星直径为十四万公里，赤道上的周边速度约为地球的二十五倍，其北极距赤道较地球近二百一十公里，南极则较远二百一十公里。
    科齐列夫认为，他这种理论可以实际运用到许多方面。例如，地球上密度较大的大陆，大部分在北半球，是由于这种力的“压挤”作用。这种力的作用使得北半球比南半球温暖等等。
    物理数学博士科齐列夫教授第一个发现月球火山爆发现象，否定了月球是一个“死天体”的说法。他还发现了金星上的极光。
