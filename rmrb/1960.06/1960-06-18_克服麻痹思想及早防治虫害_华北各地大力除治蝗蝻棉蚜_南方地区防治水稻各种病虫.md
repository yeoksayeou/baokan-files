Xinhua News Agency Report: In parts of North China, vigorous efforts are underway to eliminate newly hatched locust nymphs and control cotton aphids.

Due to prolonged drought in these areas, summer locusts emerged earlier this year than in previous years. Locust nymphs have been discovered in parts of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, as well as in northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The situation is most serious in the coastal areas of Hebei and Shandong, the Weishan Lake area, and the Yellow River floodplains.

To eliminate locusts at the young nymph stage, these areas have organized the masses to vigorously encircle and annihilate them. In eastern Henan Province, more than 1,800 locust-killing investigation teams, comprising over 40,000 people, and more than 3,000 locust-killing shock brigades, comprising over 310,000 people, have been organized. Wherever locust nymphs have been found, anti-locust battles have been launched. Kaifeng County has already eliminated locust nymphs on more than 5,000 mu of land. In Hebei Province, Yanshan, Fengrun and other counties along the coast of Bohai are conducting investigations and treatments simultaneously. Yanshan County has eliminated concentrated locust nymphs and is beginning to sweep up the remaining ones. In Jiangsu Province, Guanzhen Commune of Sihong County is implementing a system of assigning people based on fields, determining points based on workload, combining wheat harvesting with locust control, contracting for locust control while harvesting wheat, achieving great results amidst the busy summer harvest and planting season.

Similarly, due to drought and little rain, cotton aphids and other pests are spreading rapidly in cotton-growing areas of North China. Cotton fields in central and southern Hebei Province have generally found cotton aphids, with over 50% of cotton plants infested with aphids, and in severely affected cotton fields, the rate of leaf curling reaches about 30%. According to investigations in late May in Xinxiang and Nanyang prefectures in Henan Province, more than 3 million mu of cotton fields have been affected by cotton aphids. In addition, some areas have cotton spiders, thrips, and other pests in addition to cotton aphids. Currently, cotton-growing areas are vigorously spraying pesticides to control the pests and protect cotton seedlings. In Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tianjin and other areas in Hebei Province, the first round of aphid control has covered more than 3.5 million mu, and the second round of spraying and control is now underway.

In Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Hebei, Shanxi and many other regions, armyworms are currently in peak adult emergence, with larger numbers of moths than in previous years. Egg-laying has already begun in areas where they appeared earlier. A large-scale mass moth-killing movement has been launched in various places.

In some southern regions, early rice has been affected by rice borers, rice planthoppers, rice blast and other diseases and pests. According to a typical survey by the Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the occurrence of rice stem borers in Hunan Province this year is greater than last year. In addition, rice gall midges have been found on Hainan Island, Guangdong Province. These areas are also vigorously carrying out prevention and control measures.

Currently, it is an important season for the management of various crops in the seedling stage. Party committees and governments at all levels, while leading rural people's communes in strengthening summer field management, have generally paid attention to the issue of preventing and controlling diseases and pests. Industrial and commercial departments in various regions are vigorously producing and supplying pesticides and equipment. Agricultural scientific research departments have also sent many cadres and technicians to rural areas to support farmers in pest control.

Relevant departments pointed out: Now is the period when various diseases and pests are occurring in large numbers, and it is necessary to overcome all kinds of complacency, mobilize the masses to prevent and control them early, and eliminate them within a set time limit.

    华北各地大力除治蝗蝻棉蚜
    南方地区防治水稻各种病虫
    据新华社讯　华北部分地区正在大力消灭初生的蝗蝻和除治棉蚜。
    这些地区由于长时间干旱，今年夏蝗出土比往年早。河南、山东、河北三省和江苏、安徽两省北部的部分地区，都发现了蝗蝻。比较严重的仍是河北、山东的渤海沿岸，微山湖地区和黄河泛区。
    为了把蝗虫消灭在幼龄蝗蝻阶段，这些地区已经组织群众大力围歼。河南省东部各地已组织灭蝗侦查队一千八百多个、四万多人，灭蝗突击队三千多个、三十一万多人。凡是发现有蝗蝻出土的地区都展开了灭蝗战斗。开封县已消灭五千多亩面积上的蝗蝻。河北省渤海沿岸的盐山、丰润等县正在边查边治。盐山县已经把集中的蝗蝻消灭，开始扫荡残余蝗蝻。江苏省泗洪县管镇公社在夏收夏种大忙中实行以田定人，以工作量定分，结合收麦，包干治蝗，边割麦边治蝗，收效很大。
    同样，由于干旱少雨，北方各地棉区棉蚜等虫害蔓延很快。河北省中部和南部的棉田普遍发现了棉蚜，一般生蚜的棉株达50％以上，严重的棉田卷叶率达30％左右。河南省据新乡、南阳两专区5月下旬的调查，发生棉蚜的棉田有三百多万亩。此外，有些地区的棉田除棉蚜外还有棉蜘蛛、蓟马等虫害。现在，各地棉区正在大力喷药除治，保护棉苗。河北省邯郸、石家庄、保定、天津等地区所属各县第一遍治蚜的面积已达三百五十多万亩，现正开展第二遍喷药除治。
    东北和内蒙古各地以及甘肃、河北、山西等省的许多地区，目前粘虫成虫盛发，蛾量比往年大，发生较早的地区已经开始产卵。各地已经掀起了一个大规模的群众性扑蛾运动。
    南方部分地区的早稻发生了螟虫、稻飞虱、稻瘟病等病虫害。据湖南省农业科学研究所的典型调查，今年湖南省二化螟虫发生比去年多。此外，广东省海南岛发现有稻瘿蚊。现在这些地区也在大力防治。
    目前正是各种农作物苗期管理的重要季节。各地党和政府在领导农村人民公社加强夏季田间管理的工作中，普遍注意了防治病虫害的问题。各地工商部门正大力生产和供应药械。农业科学研究部门也派了很多干部和技术人员下乡，支援农民治虫。
    有关部门指出：目前是各种病虫大量发生时期，必须克服各种麻痹思想，发动群众及早防治，限期消灭。
