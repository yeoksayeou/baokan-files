Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Eighty thousand people in Tokyo today surrounded the Diet, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the U.S. Embassy, shouting "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, severely punish the murderers!" The demonstrators are determined to take action to stop the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to unilaterally vote on the new "Security Treaty" in the Senate.

The Liberal Democratic Party held a general meeting of its members this morning and decided to unilaterally vote on the new "Security Treaty" in the Senate. This news immediately aroused a tsunami of anger among people from all walks of life in Tokyo.

Students from various universities in Japan immediately mobilized. About 30,000 students in two groups poured into the Diet, where they held a protest rally. It is reported that the characteristic of today's demonstration rally was the unified display and chanting of placards and slogans such as "Down with Kishi Nobusuke" and "Abolish the Security Treaty." People shouted to the police guarding the entrance of the Diet, "Murderers!" Among these student teams were students from Saitama Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Kyoto University, and also Christian church students.

Around 4:00 p.m., workers belonging to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union joined forces with the student union. Soon, the number of workers demonstrating near the Diet had increased to 50,000. Like yesterday, the workers' teams marched to the south gate of the Diet, where they offered wreaths to the altar of the martyred Kamba Michiko, who was killed, and then held a demonstration inside the Diet, shouting slogans such as "Let us overthrow the Kishi Cabinet," "Abolish the Security Treaty," and "Americans, get out!" with very high morale.

In order to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group from unilaterally voting on the new "Security Treaty" in the Senate, Socialist Party members began gathering at the Diet Building from noon, occupying the entrance of the Senate Budget Committee.

Demonstrators sat on the ground around the Diet, determined to cope with the emergency situation. The sit-in demonstration continued, finally forcing the Kishi Nobusuke group to abandon its plan to forcibly pass the new "Security Treaty" today.

In today's demonstration, there were a large number of ordinary citizens who did not belong to any organization, who automatically formed many small teams to hold rallies and demonstrations together with workers and students.

A particularly noteworthy thing happened in today's demonstration crowd: in the demonstration team composed of children, a twelve-year-old child appealed to the demonstrators gathered in front of the Diet Building, saying, "I am still a child, but I understand that this treaty will lead us to war, let us fight together." The child's appeal was met with thunderous applause from the demonstrators.

At 7:00 p.m., the demonstrators marched to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Embassy to continue their protests. Ten thousand students are still sitting in front of the Diet demonstrating.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Tens of thousands of angry people continued to hold demonstrations and parades near the Japanese Diet and in downtown Tokyo on the afternoon of the 16th, protesting against the bloody atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Give us back our friend Kamba Michiko" and "We want to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government."

The 30,000 workers, students, university professors, and ordinary citizens who held a protest demonstration in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department were divided into two teams: one team marched to the Diet, and the other team went to Tokyo Station. Workers and students established a temporary altar at the south gate of the Diet, where Kamba Michiko was killed on the night of the 15th. Protesters gathered near the Diet went there to offer wreaths to express their condolences to the young victim. After paying their respects at the altar, the demonstrators held a particularly strong demonstration. The demonstration continued until 9:00 p.m. before gradually dispersing.

At the same time, another approximately 20,000 people, mainly workers, marched in the Tokyo commercial district, singing revolutionary songs and shouting slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" in Japan decided today to hold a "National Funeral" ceremony for the female student Kamba Michiko, who was cruelly killed by the Kishi Nobusuke government's police last night for participating in a patriotic demonstration, and called on all member organizations to mobilize as many people as possible to hold protest demonstrations against Kishi Nobusuke's Prime Minister's Office and residence, as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has 3.6 million members, decided to support the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty"'s decision and decided to participate in the "National Funeral" ceremony.

    决心阻止岸政府在参议院强行通过日美军事条约的阴谋
    东京八万人包围国会和美大使馆
    示威群众愤怒高呼打倒岸内阁，美国人滚回去，严惩杀人犯
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：东京八万公众今天包围了国会、警视厅和美国大使馆，高呼打倒岸信介内阁，严惩杀人犯。示威群众决心用行动阻止岸信介集团在参议院单独表决新“安全条约”的阴谋。
    自由民主党今晨召开议员全体会议，决定在参议院单独表决新“安全条约”。这个消息立即激起了东京各界人民海啸般的怒吼。
    日本各大学学生立即动员起来。约有三万多学生分两批涌向国会，他们在那里举行了抗议集会。消息说，今天示威集会群众的特点是统一打着和喊着“打倒岸信介”和“废除安全条约”的标语牌和口号。人们向守在国会门口的警察喊道：“杀人犯！”在这些学生队伍中，有来自埼玉县、千叶县和京都大学生，也有基督教会的学生。
    下午四点钟光景，属于东京都政府职员工会的工人们同学生会师。不久，在国会附近示威的工人已经增加到五万人。像昨天一样，工人队伍走向国会的南门，他们在那里向被杀害的桦美智子烈士的祭坛献了花圈，然后在国会院内举行示威，高呼“让我们推翻岸内阁”，“废除安全条约”和“美国人，滚回去”等口号，斗志非常昂扬。
    为了阻止岸信介集团在参议院单独表决新“安全条约”，社会党议员从中午开始在国会大厦集合，他们占据了参议院预算委员会的门口。
    示威群众在国会周围席地而坐，决心应付紧急状态。静坐示威一直继续着，终于迫使岸信介集团放弃了在今天强行通过新“安全条约”的计划。
    在今天的示威中，有大批不属于任何组织的普通市民，他们自动组成了许多小队伍同工人、学生一起举行大会和示威。
    今天在示威人群中发生一件特别引人注目的事情：在由儿童组成的示威队伍中，有一个十二岁的孩子向集会在国会大楼前面的示威者呼吁说，“我还是一个孩子，但是我懂得这个条约将把我们带向战争，让我们一起斗争吧。”这个儿童的呼吁获得了示威群众的雷鸣般的掌声。
    晚七点钟，示威群众走向东京都警视厅和美国大使馆继续进行抗议活动。一万名学生仍然坐在国会前面示威。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：数万愤怒群众16日下午继续在日本国会附近和东京中心市区举行示威游行，抗议岸信介政府的血腥暴行。示威者高呼“把我们的朋友桦美智子还给我们”、“我们要推翻岸信介政府”等口号。
    在东京都警视厅前举行抗议示威的三万名工人、学生、大学教授和普通市民分成两路队伍：一路队伍游行到国会去，另一路队伍到东京车站去。工人和学生在桦美智子15日夜间被打死的国会南便门前建立了一个临时祭坛。在国会附近集会的抗议者都到那里献花圈，对年青的死难者表示哀悼。示威者在祭坛致哀后，举行了特别强有力的示威。示威一直继续到九点钟才开始逐渐解散。
    同时，另外大约两万人，主要是工人，在东京商业区游行，他们高唱革命歌曲和高呼“打倒岸信介内阁”的口号。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定为昨天晚间因参加爱国示威而被岸信介政府警察残酷杀害的女学生桦美智子举行“国民葬”仪式，并且号召各成员组织动员尽量多的人参加，以便向岸信介的首相官邸和住宅及东京都警视厅举行抗议示威。
    拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会决定支持“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的这个决定，并决定参加“国民葬”仪式。
