Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 6th – After achieving a bumper harvest of spring crops, Sichuan Province is comprehensively carrying out the summer grain purchase and storage work. As of May 25th, the wheat and beans sold and stored by people's communes across the province have reached over 460 million jin. Tongnan, Huidong, Jingyan, Ebian, and two other counties have completed or overfulfilled their summer grain purchase tasks.

This year, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan Province have particularly emphasized closely integrating summer grain purchase work with arranging the masses' lives, coordinating and balancing the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members, and conducting political and ideological education for commune members. Mianyang, Yibin, Xichang, and other regions have educated commune members about not forgetting patriotism in times of good harvest. Zizhong County, while assigning summer grain purchase tasks to the communes, strengthened publicity and education. From the county to the commune and management district, a Party committee secretary was specifically assigned to arrange the masses' lives. As a result, both the completion of the state purchase task was ensured, and sufficient seeds, rations, and fodder were retained. Before the summer grain harvest, the grain departments of Neijiang and Leshan regions, under the leadership of the Party committee, educated commune members, repeatedly verified the output, and conducted trial calculations for summer grain distribution. The results were announced to the masses, so that commune members understood the output, the purchase volume, and the amount of grain retained, which improved their enthusiasm for selling grain. Commune members implemented quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick sale, and quick storage. Now, the summer grain has been basically harvested in these two regions, and the summer grain purchase task has been completed by more than 60%. The relevant departments of Daxian region assisted the communes in reforming 1,312 water mills and more than 6,000 animal-powered mills, and added roller stone mills and steel mills, basically solving the wheat processing problem and meeting the needs of the region's 5.66 million agricultural population for flour.

Because the amount of summer grain purchased this year is large and the time is concentrated, the grain departments in Sichuan Province have paid special attention to helping communes and production teams properly arrange labor and organize timely storage. Under the unified leadership of the county Party committee, the finance and trade departments of Tongnan County worked together and sent cadres to the communes to assist in arranging the summer grain harvesting, threshing, drying, and transportation. In less than ten days, the entire summer grain purchase task was completed. The relevant departments of Nanbu County helped the communes with the arrangement of grain sources and the preparation of storage capacity, so that more than 95% of the purchased summer grain could be directly loaded onto vehicles and ships at once, eliminating the secondary collection and transportation work. It is estimated that this can save 120,000 labor days and 48,000 yuan in transportation costs. In the purchase process, the policy of pricing according to quality was also conscientiously implemented. Fuling County adopted a method of joint consultation between leaders and the masses. In addition to publicly announcing the purchase price, sample tables and "fair scales" were set up at each purchase point, which made the masses very satisfied.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th – Shandong Province, one of the major wheat-producing areas, has fully prepared for the summer grain purchase. While celebrating the bumper wheat harvest and rushing to harvest and thresh, the vast number of commune members have begun to sell summer grain to the state. The people's communes in Guan County, which were the first in the province to complete the wheat purchase task last year, have taken the lead again this year, competing to hand in public grain and sell surplus grain. Many people's communes in Licheng, Qihe, Cao County, and Zou County have also sent well-dried and cleaned high-quality wheat to the state's grain warehouses.

In early May, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of the first secretaries of local (city) and county Party committees, analyzed the excellent summer situation, and made comprehensive arrangements for summer grain purchase, distribution, and commune members' lives. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the counties generally convened meetings in mid-May, fully discussed the policies and methods of purchase and distribution, and carried out publicity and education among the vast number of cadres and the masses. Now the summer grain purchase task has been generally implemented.

The grain departments have prepared sufficient warehouses according to this year's purchase task, cleaned and disinfected them, and laid sand at the bottom. They have also added a large number of grain receiving points. According to statistics from six regions and cities, including Heze, Jinan, Yantai, Changwei, Jining, and Zibo, more than 4,300 grain receiving points have been set up. The grain delivery distance in most areas is shorter than last year. All grain purchasing personnel have generally received political and ideological education and technical training. The grain departments have also trained custodians for the communes and production teams, assisted them in establishing a relatively complete grain management system, and built warehouses for storing rations, seeds, and fodder, in order to effectively achieve dedicated grain for dedicated use, and create conditions for comprehensive management from receipt to use. Commercial departments at all levels have prepared a large number of means of production and means of livelihood, which are continuously transported to the countryside to meet the needs of commune and team production and commune members' lives after the wheat harvest.

Currently, Party committees at all levels are further strengthening their leadership over the purchase and distribution work. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee dispatched more than 1,000 cadres, led by responsible comrades, to go deep into various places to inspect the preparations for summer harvest and summer planting, and purchase and storage. The prefectural committees, county committees, and commune committees have also organized thousand-person and ten-thousand-person inspection teams to go deep into the communes and teams, live, eat, and work with the commune members, carry out the "five sides" (harvesting, threshing, purchasing, transporting, and distributing simultaneously), "five goods" (good harvest, good purchase, good distribution, good storage, and good use), and "four timelys" (timely harvesting, timely purchasing, timely distribution, and timely arrangement of the masses' lives) campaign, in order to complete the purchase task quickly and well.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th – Changde Prefecture in Hunan, which has achieved a bumper rapeseed harvest, had overfulfilled its annual rapeseed unified purchase task by the end of May.

This year, the people's communes in Changde Prefecture have achieved a bumper rapeseed harvest and are very grateful for the leadership and support of the Party and the government, and are eager to sell their oilseeds to the state. Before the start of the rapeseed oil unified purchase work, Party committees at all levels in the region held meetings and conducted in-depth patriotic education among cadres and the masses. The grain and oil purchasing departments adopted the method of setting up points in warehouses and storing them in presses, which facilitated the masses to sell.

At the beginning of the unified purchase work, all localities closely combined production, seized every opportunity, and concentrated their efforts to rush purchase. Many places implemented simultaneous harvesting, threshing, drying, rectifying, and storing, which accelerated the storage progress. After the purchase was basically completed, the entire region immediately launched a "double high" (high yield, high oil yield) oil extraction campaign, organizing more than 11,000 people and more than 3,000 oil presses to work day and night in shifts, vigorously processing edible oil.

    四川山东各公社踊跃交售新粮
    湖南省常德专区超额完成全年油菜籽统购任务
    新华社成都6日电　四川省各地在获得小春作物丰收以后，全面开展夏粮征购入库工作，截至5月25日，全省各人民公社交售入库的小麦和豆类已达四亿六千多万斤；潼南、会东、井研、峨边等六个县，已经完成或超额完成夏粮征购任务。
    今年，四川省各级党委特别强调把夏粮征购工作和安排好群众生活紧密结合起来，统筹兼顾国家、集体、社员三方面的利益，并且对社员进行政治思想教育。绵阳、宜宾、西昌等专区，对社员进行了丰收不忘爱国的教育。资中县把夏粮收购任务安排到公社的同时，加强了宣传教育，从县到公社、管理区，都由一位党委书记具体安排群众生活，结果，既保证了国家征购任务的完成，又留足了种子、口粮、饲料。内江、乐山专区粮食部门在夏粮收获以前，在党委领导下，对公社社员进行了教育，然后反复核实了产量，进行夏粮试算分配工作，向群众公布，使社员明了产量、征购量和留粮数量，提高了社员的售粮热情。社员们实行了快收、快打、快交售、快入库。现在这两个专区的夏粮已基本收割完毕，夏粮收购任务已完成60％以上。达县专区有关部门协助公社改革水磨一千三百一十二处，畜力磨六千多副，增添了滚筒石磨和钢磨，基本解决了小麦加工问题，满足了全区五百六十六万农业人口吃面粉的需要。
    由于今年夏粮收购的数量大，时间集中，四川省粮食部门特别注意帮助公社、生产队妥善安排劳力，及时组织入库。潼南县财贸各部门在县委统一领导下，拧成一股绳，派干部到公社协助安排夏粮的收、打、晒、运工作，不到十天时间，就完成了全部夏粮征购任务。南部县有关部门帮助公社进行了粮源摆布和仓容准备工作，使95％以上的征购夏粮都能一次直接上车上船，消灭了二度集运工作，据计算，可以节约劳动日十二万个和运费四万八千多元。各地在征购中，还认真贯彻了依质论价的政策。涪陵县采取领导和群众共同协商的办法，除了张榜公布收购价格以外，各收购点都设了样品台、“公平秤”，使群众十分满意。
    新华社济南6日电　小麦主要产区之一的山东省，已全面做好夏粮征购的准备工作。广大社员在欢庆小麦丰收、突击抢收抢打的同时，开始向国家出售夏粮。去年全省第一个完成小麦征购任务的冠县各人民公社，今年又一马当先，争先恐后交公粮卖余粮。历城、齐河、曹县、邹县的许多人民公社，也都纷纷把晒干扬净的上好小麦送入国家的粮食仓库。
    中共山东省委于5月初召开了各地（市）县委第一书记会议，分析了夏季大好形势，对夏粮征购、分配和社员生活安排作了全面部署。各县根据省委指示，于5月中旬普遍召开了会议，充分讨论了征购、分配的政策和办法，并在广大干部和群众中进行了宣传教育。现在夏粮征购任务已普遍落实。
    粮食部门根据今年的征购任务，准备了充足的仓房，进行了清扫消毒和铺沙垫底，还增设了大批征购粮接收点。据菏泽、济南、烟台、昌潍、济宁、淄博等六个专区、市统计，已设接粮点四千三百多处。大部分地区的送粮里程都比去年缩短。各地对粮食收购人员普遍进行了政治思想教育和技术训练。粮食部门还为公社、生产队训练了保管员，协助公社、生产队建立一套较完整的粮食管理制度，建设储藏口粮、种子、饲料的仓库，为切实做到专粮专用，从收到用，全面管好创造了条件。各级商业部门准备了大批生产资料和生活资料，源源不断地运往农村，以满足麦收后社、队生产和社员生活的需要。
    目前，各级党委正在进一步加强对征购、分配工作的领导。最近省委又派出一千多名干部，由负责同志率领，深入各地检查夏收夏种和征购入库的各项准备工作。地委、县委和公社党委也都组织了千人、万人检查团，深入社队与社员同吃同住同劳动，开展“五边”（边收割、边打晒、边征购、边调运、边分配）、“五好”（收获好、征购好、分配好、保管好、使用好）、“四及时”（及时收割、及时征购、及时分配、及时安排群众生活）的运动，做到又快又好地全面完成征购任务。
    新华社长沙6日电　获得油菜籽大丰收的湖南常德专区，到5月底已超额完成今年油菜籽统购任务。
    今年，常德专区各人民公社获得油菜丰收，十分感激党和政府的领导与支持，踊跃将油料卖给国家。全区各级党委在菜油统购工作开始以前，都召开了会议，深入地向干部和群众进行了爱国主义教育。粮油收购部门采取了就仓设点、就榨入库的办法，便利群众出售。
    在统购工作一开始，各地又紧密结合生产，见缝插针，集中力量突击收购。许多地方实行边收、边打、边晒、边整、边入库，加快了入库进度。在收购基本结束以后，全区又紧接着开展了一个“双高”（产量高、出油率高）的榨油运动，组织了一万一千多人、三千多筒榨，日夜轮流作业，大力加工食油。（附图片）
