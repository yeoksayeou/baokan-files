    Sōhyō and Neutral Trade Union Federation Issue Statement:
    Japanese Workers to Counterattack Authorities' Suppression
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō) and the Federation of Independent Unions issued a joint statement on the general strike, saying that today's unified action "has received the support of the vast majority of the people nationwide and has achieved great success."
    The statement pointed out: "The reason it has developed into an unprecedented unified action is due to the undemocratic practices of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. Therefore, the Kishi Cabinet should honestly reflect and immediately take responsibility for what has happened so far. If Prime Minister Kishi not only shows no intention of reflecting but also suppresses the unified action of the 4th, we will immediately counterattack with the power of all workers and the people of the whole country."

    总评和中立工会联合会发表声明说
    日本工人要反击当局镇压
    日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会就总罢工发表联合声明说，今天的统一行动“得到了全国绝大多数国民的支持，获得了很大成功。”
    声明指出：“所以发展成为空前未有的统一行动，其原因在于岸信介内阁不民主的做法。因此，岸内阁应该老老实实进行反省，立即承担迄今为止的责任。如果岸首相不仅没有反省之意，并对4日的统一行动加以镇压，我们就要立即以全体工人和全国国民的力量加以反击。”
