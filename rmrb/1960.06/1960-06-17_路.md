    Road
    Ye Ping, Gaoghuang People's Commune, Huixian, Henan
    I don't know when, the car climbed onto the winding mountain road, and in a moment it disappeared into the misty fog. After two or three more turns, it would only take three minutes to reach Bixi Station.
    I was the only passenger getting off the car. A few steps out of the slope, I heard the clanging sound of flowing springs, how quiet!
    I looked up at the road ahead, the winding path was covered by lush green grass, looming, as if no one had trampled on it for a long time. However, I also felt that in the past, the people from my hometown of Fengchuan had to walk this winding path every day with loads on their shoulders, so it would never be desolate. Looking around, I could only see the green rocks exposed in the distance from the grass, with the white characters "Mu Po" written on the rocks, and nothing else could be seen clearly. After climbing a few more steps, I accidentally discovered that steep slope, oh! What a familiar little slope... I can't remember what year it was, in the summer, pears and apples were all ripe, and life at home was not easy. Dad picked a basket of pears and a basket of apples and asked me to sell them. It was at this place that I accidentally slipped and fell on my back, and the two baskets of pears and apples rolled all over the slope, into the grass. At this time, I forgot the pain in my body, and only cared about looking for pears and apples in the grass. As a result, I only found a dozen or so, and the ones I found were all broken, and the sweet juice was oozing out. ...
    I went home preparing to be scolded by my dad, but my dad didn't scold me, he just patted my head and said, "We are so unfortunate," and then started cursing the mountain road.
    Yes, this is the place, no mistake. I climbed to the top of the small hill, but I heard the bleating of sheep in my ears.
    "Comrade, where are you going?" A "Red scarf" was herding a few sheep, and he spoke fluent Mandarin.
    "I'm from Fengchuan, I'm going home."
    "Oh--" he paused, "What are you doing?" he asked vigilantly.
    I had to explain to him that I hadn't been home for a few years.
    "Oh, no wonder you got lost. Now everyone going to Fengchuan Township takes the highway. Look, there's no road to walk here anymore, isn't it all a pasture now? Here, I'll take you to the highway." Saying that, he immediately urged his flock of sheep and led me on the road.
    I asked him who he was herding the sheep for. He said it was the sheep for their Young Pioneers' work-study program, and it was his turn to be on duty today. Only then did I notice that he was also carrying a schoolbag behind him.
    "The highway is great, don't look at how many turns it has, but the road surface is very smooth, and many cars have come through it." It seems that this child really loves that highway.
    "Comrade, this was built last year. It was the year after the People's Commune was established. At that time, Secretary Li of the commune mobilized the strength of the entire commune and built it in only a week, and used tens of thousands of catties of explosives! Comrade, if it weren't for the great strength of the commune, we wouldn't be able to build it no matter what. A while ago, Secretary Li also said that we should accumulate funds, and in two years we will make it into asphalt. --I don't know what asphalt looks like, but I heard it's smooth and soft. Comrade, you must have seen it."
    I replied that I had seen it. I was simply intoxicated by his description.
    "Do you know that in the year before last, that is, in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, the exploration team came here. They said there were many good mines here..."
    I smiled and asked him what his name was, what grade he was in, and which village he was from. He answered me one by one. I learned that his name was Xiao Fu, and he would be entering junior high school this summer, and he was from Lingxi. As we talked, we had crossed two small hills and arrived at the highway. I thanked him and parted ways with him.
    At this time, the spring breeze was gently blowing, the sky and the mountains seemed so light, and a flat highway appeared in front of me. What a wide road this is...

    路
    河南辉县高庄公社  叶萍
    不知在什么时候，汽车爬上了蜿蜒的盘山路，一忽儿又隐匿在蒙蒙的雾中了。再转两三个弯，费不了三分钟就是碧溪车站了。
    下车的旅客只是我一个。出斜坡数步便听见铮铮的流泉声，多么幽静啊！
    我抬头望望前面的路，蜿蜒的小径被萋萋的青草复没，若隐若现，好像已经很久没有人践踏过了。但是，我又觉得，以往丰川家乡的人每天挑担往返来去，都是要盘这条弯曲的小路的，所以它是怎么也不会荒芜的。四周觅寻，只能看到远处露出草丛的青岩，岩石上写着白字“牧坡”，别的什么也看不清了。又爬了几步，偶然发现那个陡斜的小坡，哦！多么熟悉的小斜坡呀……是哪一年我记不太清了，夏天，梨子、苹果都下来了，家里生活不好过，爹爹摘了一篮子梨和一篮子苹果，要我去卖。也就是挑到这个地方，脚下一不小心，骨碌一滑摔了个仰面朝天，两篮子梨和苹果便滚了满坡，滚到草丛里去了。这时我把身上的痛也忘了，只顾去草中寻梨子找苹果，结果只找了十多个，找到的也都碰破了，那甜水儿浸浸地直往外溢。……
    我回家准备着要挨爹爹的骂，但是爹没有骂我，他只拍了拍我的头说了声“我们苦命哇”，接着竟骂起山路来了。
    对，是这个地方，不会错的。我爬上了小山顶，耳边却听到咩咩的羊叫声。
    “同志，去哪的？”一个“红领巾”正赶了几只山羊在牧放，他说的是满口的普通话。
    “我是丰川人，我是回家的。”
    “噫——”他停了停，“你是干啥的？”他警觉地转问。
    我不得不向他解释了一番，说我有几年没回过家了。
    “哦，怨不得你迷路了。这会去丰川乡的都要走公路了，你看这哪里还有路可走呢，不是都成了牧坡了吗？喏，我领你上公路去。”说着立即?斥他的羊群便领我上路了。
    我问他是给谁放羊。他说是他们少先队勤工俭学的羊，今天该他值班牧放。这时我才发现他身后还挂着个书包。
    “公路好极了，别看它拐的弯多，但是，那路面才平哩，来过的汽车可多呢。”看来这孩子对那条公路是真的爱呀。
    “同志，这是去年才修的。是成立了人民公社的后一年。那时，公社李书记调动了全公社的力量，只用了一星期就修好了，光炸药就用了上万斤！同志，要不是公社的力量大，说什么也修不起来呀。前时，李书记还说要我们积累资金，再过两年还要把它修成柏油的。——我也不知道柏油的是什么样子，反正听说是光滑的，又是软绵绵的。同志，你总会见过的吧。”
    我回答他说见过。我简直被他的描述陶醉了。
    “你知道吗，在前年，就是1958年大炼钢铁那年，勘探队来过我们这里，他们说这里有很多很好的矿……”
    我笑着问他叫什么名字，上几年级了，是哪村的。他一一回答了我。我知道了他的名字叫小福，今年暑期就该升初中了，是岭溪的人。说着说着，我们已经翻过了两个小山丘，来到了公路上。我谢了谢他，便和他分手了。
    这时春风正温和地吹拂着，天空和群山显得那么清淡，一条平坦的公路呈现在我的眼前。这是一条多么宽阔的路啊……
