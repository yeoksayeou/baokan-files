    Reforming Music Teaching
    Li Yinghai, Deputy Director of the Composition Department, Shanghai Conservatory of Music

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, our Shanghai Conservatory of Music has made great achievements in recent years. After the 1958 teaching reform, our conservatory's Theory and Composition Department underwent relatively large changes in its curriculum. Currently, under the leadership of the Party Committee, we are conducting continuous educational revolution to establish a socialist and national musical teaching system.

    Old China's comprador-bourgeois music education rigidly copied the Western system, believing that everything foreign was good. Students learning composition needed to first study several technical foundation courses in order to write choral, ensemble, or accompanied pieces. These courses taught materials from the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe, even some from the 16th century, much of which was outdated and no longer used in European composition, with heavy rules and layers of constraints, making it very mysterious. As a result, some people, after completing their studies, had heads full of rigid rules and simply couldn't compose, or dared not compose. Even if they did, the content was empty, and the melody, harmony, and style were all Europeanized.

    I was a graduate of the last class of the old Chinese Conservatory of Music, and that is how I learned.

    Must Start Learning National and Folk Music From Scratch

    In the early days after liberation, I was assigned to teach composition theory at a military art academy. At that time, the leadership pointed out to me: "You are teaching creative cadres from military cultural troupes, so you must not teach the old way you learned." I was truly at a loss upon hearing this. At this point, the Party organization clearly pointed out that to solve this problem, we must first criticize bourgeois literary and artistic thought, study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and conduct teaching using the principle of integrating theory with practice. Therefore, it was necessary to start learning national and folk music from scratch. But if I didn't love it, even if good things were placed before me, I couldn't see them, so how could I learn anything from national and folk music? The leadership also helped me, asking me to have more contact with reality, to learn from the working people, and to conscientiously transform my thinking and improve my understanding.

    In this way, I began to study and research national music more consciously, to study the modes of folk music, to explore the harmonic problems of folk modes, and to try to incorporate some national music content in my teaching. Initially, I was just holed up in a room, relying on my little theoretical knowledge, and not only couldn't solve practical problems, but got more and more confused. When I read Chairman Mao's "On Practice," which mentioned that "the basis of theory is practice," I suddenly woke up. While learning folk music, I adapted some folk songs, began to study the works of Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and explored national modal harmony problems by arranging accompaniments for some of Nie Er's and Xian Xinghai's works, which then enabled learning and research to develop in a new way.

    In 1952, I came to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to teach, continuing to study national and folk music. But some people said that my work on these things was "child's play," unreasonable, and even said that a handout I made on studying folk modes was "unlearned." At this time, I began to waver, fearing that people would say I didn't know much about European music and that I would be looked down upon by experts. For a while, I even thought about abandoning my original research work and specializing in modern European music. At this time, the Party member comrades who were with me encouraged me to continue studying national harmony problems. Under the Party's enlightenment and education, I realized that to reform the curriculum, I must first transform my own thinking. When I realized that my work itself was part of the revolutionary cause, I generated real motivation that allowed me to move forward quickly.

    Starting in 1954, I included national modal harmony content as a unit in the formal curriculum. Although the teaching materials were still very rough at that time, they received the enthusiastic support of the veteran cadres studying in my class. At that time, some people still said that this was nonsense, saying that this problem was originally very simple, nothing great, and they believed that national things were simple and primitive.

    After the Double-Anti Movement, I incorporated national modal harmony content into harmony lessons and taught in conjunction with composition. Under the encouragement of the great general line for building socialism, and under the Party's call to break down superstitions and liberate thought, I wrote the book "Chinese Modal Systems and Their Harmonies," summarizing the experiences I had accumulated in research and teaching over the years, hoping to help solve the problem of national harmony. At that time, I was very busy with my work. In addition to my own work, I also had to substitute for the classes of sick comrades. What to do when there was not enough time? I used my evening time to conduct scientific research in conjunction with lesson preparation.

    With the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the educational revolution was carried out vigorously in our school. Inspired by the masses, I boldly proposed opening a basic course on multi-part writing, combining the original several foundation courses on the basis of national modal harmony, completely changing the unreasonable phenomenon of their mutual isolation and cumbersomeness and repetition, and also adding content that should have been there but was not. The establishment of this course not only greatly reduced the learning time of basic technical theory, but also improved the quality of teaching because many of the problems were presented more scientifically and were based on national melodies, making it easier for learners to understand and master.

    The Support of the Party and the Masses Gave Me a Foothold

    In the spring of 1959, a few people, under the guise of emphasizing scientific analysis, used strict technical exercises, standardization, and the need for key schools to improve as excuses to raise many criticisms of the multi-part writing course. A few people with serious blind worship of foreign ideas thought: "The European system has been tested for hundreds of years, how can you overturn it all at once?"

    However, the Party promptly provided me with education and encouragement, and the masses also strongly supported my persistence in experimenting with the new course. I had strength and courage. I thought that this course must not be cancelled. This is the result of the Great Leap Forward and the result of the educational revolution. I stood firm and was not intimidated by them. My understanding of the problem became clearer, and I also improved my thinking.

    Now, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, this course has been consolidated. After more than a year of teaching, it has been preliminarily proved that the direction of this change is correct, and the students are learning with great interest. Because it conforms to national characteristics and integrates theory with practice, learners have broken down mysterious views and can quickly master the writing techniques needed in actual creation, and the quality has been significantly improved. For example, shortly after the course started last year, some students were able to write basic accompaniments for songs such as "Socialism is Good" and "I am a Soldier," as well as folk songs. Some students said: "In the past, I studied traditional Western harmony for two years, but after finishing, I didn't know how to use it, but now I have solved many problems in two classes." Currently, the "Multi-Part Writing" course is developing to a higher stage.

    New attempts have also been made in the teaching methods of this course. The homework tutoring classes adopt a combination of collective and individual methods. After the anti-Rightist rectification movement, this method has been further improved. We have added "exercise classes." We arrange the students' homework time immediately after class, arranging for two or three collective exercises. The teacher is present to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Students can also inspire and help each other more easily, and supplementary teaching is carried out when necessary. In this way, students' thinking is concentrated, and the phenomenon of rework and unstable quality is avoided. The time spent on homework is less than before, the course progress is accelerated, and the quality is also improved.

    Starting this academic year, I have also been teaching the composition course. The previous composition course mainly focused on technical exercises, emphasizing form and not content, and most of the techniques were a set of foreign practices. Due to being divorced from politics and divorced from life, many students did not know what to write, so they wrote a lot of things expressing personal feelings, writing some incomprehensible things, and even putting the name of the song on it after the song was finished. Some students couldn't write songs and could only complain that they had no creative talent. Although these situations have changed somewhat since the anti-Rightist movement in 1957, the problem has not been fundamentally solved. Going to labor and going to life practice, the Party's educational policy and literary and artistic policy have long pointed out the direction for us, that we should go to the working people and go to life practice. We have rich experience in revolutionary art education, as well as the experience of our school in creating works such as the "Happiness River Chorus" in 1958, but these important experiences have not been fully applied to the composition course. Therefore, not long after the start of school, the branch secretary and I took the students to the Maqiao Commune, asking the students to write mass songs to reflect the reality of the struggle in a timely and rapid manner. In this way, students had something to write about and would no longer be depressed about not finding a subject. We promoted learning through collective creation, closely linking the composition course with social needs and social musical life, participating in mass poetry and song competitions, and conducting on-site teaching at performing groups. One overseas Chinese student originally did not know many national musical instruments, but during an on-site teaching session at a national orchestra, she immediately understood them. Later, we combined the composition course with the labor course and developed the "Creation Day" system, writing many mass songs in coordination with political movements and major events on the production front, and collectively created the "Young Pioneers Chorus."

    I have personally realized that in order to truly make students become composers needed by the Party, we must care about their thinking. Before creation, we often engage in theoretical discussions, attach importance to grasping creative ideas and creative methods, so that students not only learn their profession in the composition class, but also greatly improve their thinking.

    Currently, I, along with the students and all the comrades in the college, am continuing to work hard for the further reform of the teaching work in our college. Under the leadership of the Party, we have the confidence to build a new type of music teaching system in a not too long time.

### 改革音乐的教学工作

    改革音乐的教学工作
    上海音乐学院作曲系副主任　黎英海
    我们上海音乐学院在党的正确领导下，几年来取得了很大的成绩。我们学院的理论作曲系经过1958年教学改革，在课程上发生了比较大的变化。目前我们正在党委的领导下，为建立社会主义的、民族的音乐教学体系进行着不断的教育革命。
    旧中国买办资产阶级的音乐教育，硬搬西洋的一套，认为一切都是外国的好。学作曲的人，为了写合唱合奏或者带伴奏的乐曲，就需要先学几门技术基础课。这些课程中讲的都是欧洲十七、十八世纪的材料，甚至还有十六世纪的，其中有不少内容陈旧，在欧洲创作上也早已不用了，重重规则，层层束缚，弄得非常神秘。因此，有些人学完后满脑子的清规戒律，根本就不会作曲，也不敢作曲，即使作出来了，也是内容空洞、而且从旋律、和声到风格全部是欧化的。
    我是旧中国音乐学院最后一届毕业生，就是这样学过来的。
    必须从头学习民族、民间音乐
    解放初期，我被派到部队艺术学院教作曲理论，当时领导上向我指出：“你教的是部队文工团来的创作干部，千万不能照你学的老一套来教。”我一听真是不知所措。这时党组织明确指出要解决这一问题，首先要批判资产阶级文艺思想，学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，用理论联系实际的原则进行教学。因此必须从头学习民族、民间音乐。但自己不喜爱，就是好的，摆在我面前也是看不到，又怎能从民族民间音乐中学习到什么呢？领导上又帮助我，要我多接触实际，向劳动人民学习，认真改造思想，提高认识。
    这样，我才开始较有意识地去学习和研究民族音乐、研究民间音乐的调式、摸索民间调式的和声问题，并且在教课中尝试结合一点民族音乐的内容。最初只是关在屋子里凭自己的一点理论知识在搞，不仅不能解决实际问题，反而越弄越糊涂。当读了毛主席的实践论中提到“理论的基础是实践”，才使我猛醒过来。在学习民间音乐的同时，改编一些民歌，着手研究聂耳、星海等同志的作品，并通过为聂耳、星海的一部分作品编配伴奏来探索民族调式和声问题，于是才使学习和研究有了新的开展。
    1952年我来到上海音乐学院担任教学工作，继续进行民族民间音乐的研究。但是有人说我搞这些玩意儿是“小儿科”，没有道理，甚至还说我搞的一份研究民间调式的讲义是“不学无术”。这时我就动摇起来了，生怕人家说我懂得欧洲的不多，被专家瞧不起。有一段时间曾想放弃原来的研究工作，专门去钻研欧洲近代的音乐。这时，和我在一起的党员同志却鼓励我继续研究民族和声问题。在党的启发教育下，我认识到要改革课程首先要改造自己的思想。当我认识到本身工作是革命事业的一部分时，就产生了真正的动力，使我快步前进。
    从1954年开始，我就把民族调式和声的内容作为一个单元列入正式的课程中，尽管那时教材还很粗糙，却得到在我班上进修的老干部们的热情支持。当时还有人说这是胡搞，说这个问题本来很简单，没啥了不起，他们认为民族的东西是简单原始的。
    双反运动后，我便把民族调式和声的内容贯穿到和声课中，并联系创作来进行教学。在伟大的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，在党提出破除迷信，解放思想的号召下，我写出了“汉族调式及其和声”这本书，将几年来研究的心得，和在教学中积累的经验总结出来，希望对解决民族和声问题有所帮助。当时我的工作很忙，除了本身工作外，还要兼代生病同志的课。时间不够怎么办？我就利用每天晚上时间，结合着备课进行科学研究。
    随着工农业大跃进，教育革命在我们学校中轰轰烈烈地开展起来。在群众的启发下，我大胆提出开设多声部写作基础课的建议，将原来的几门基础课在民族调式和声的基础上合而为一，彻底改变他们彼此孤立和繁琐、重复的不合理现象，而且还增加了本来应当有而没有的内容。这门课的建立，不仅可以大大减少基础技术理论的学习时间，而且由于其中许多问题的提法比较科学，又是以民族音调为基础的，学习的人容易融会贯通，因而提高了教学质量。
    党和群众的支持使我站住了脚跟
    1959年春天，有少数人在强调科学分析的幌子下，以严格技术锻炼、正规化、重点学校要提高等为借口，对多声部写作课提出了许多非难。少数盲目崇洋思想严重的人认为：“人家欧洲的一套是经过几百年考验的，你能一下子把它推翻吗？”
    但是，党及时对我进行了教育与鼓励，群众也大力支持我坚持新课的试验，我有了力量，有了勇气。我想，这门课决不能取消，这是大跃进的成果，是教育革命的成果。我站住了脚没有被他们吓倒。对问题的认识更明确了，也提高了自己的思想。
    现在这门课已在党的领导下和群众的支持下巩固下来了。经过一年多来的教学，初步证明，这种变革的方向是对头的，同学们学得很有兴趣。由于符合民族特点，理论联系实际，学的人打破了神秘观点，能较快地掌握到实际创作中所需要的写作技术，质量显著提高。如去年开课不久，有些同学便能较好的为“社会主义好”“我是一个兵”等歌曲及民歌写基本的伴奏。有的同学说：“从前学了两年西洋传统和声学，学完了不会用，而现在两堂课就解决了不少问题。”目前“多声部写作”课正向更高的阶段发展。
    在这门课的教学方法上，也相应地作了新的尝试。作业辅导课，采取集体与个别相结合的方式，经过反右倾整风运动，这一方式又有了新的改进。我们增加了“习题课”。把同学们的做习题时间紧接在上课后，安排为二、三次集体做习题，教师在场发现问题及时解决，同学更便于相互启发帮助，必要时进行补充教授。这样同学思想集中，避免了返工、质量不稳定的现象。作业所花费的时间比以前少，课程进度加快了，质量也提高了。
    这学年起，我又担任了作曲课。从前的作曲课主要是技术锻炼，重形式，不讲内容，手法上大半是外国的一套。由于脱离政治、脱离生活，很多学生不知道写什么好，因而大量写抒发个人感情的东西，写一些不可捉摸的东西，甚至是写完了曲子才来安上曲子名字，有些学生写不出曲子只好埋怨自己没有创作才能。这些情况虽然自1957年反右以后有所改变，但还没有从根本上解决问题。到劳动中去，到生活实践中去党的教育方针与文艺方针早就给我们指出了方向，应当到劳动人民中去，到生活实践中去。我们有丰富的革命艺术教育的经验，以及我们学校在1958年创作“幸福河大合唱”等作品的经验，但是这些重要的经验都没有完全应用到作曲课中来。因此在开学不久，支部书记和我带着同学下马桥公社，要求同学写群众歌曲来及时迅速地反映现实斗争生活。这样同学有东西好写了，再不会为找不到题材而苦闷。我们以集体创作带动学习，把作曲课和社会需要、社会音乐生活紧密地联系起来，参加群众的赛诗赛歌会，到演出团体进行现场教学。有个华侨同学本来有很多民族乐器都不认识，但在到民族乐团的一次现场教学中，她一下就弄清楚了。以后我们把作曲课和劳动课结合起来，发展为“创作日”的制度，配合政治运动、生产战线上重大的事件写了不少群众歌曲，并集体创作了“红领巾大合唱”。
    我切身体会到，要使学生真正能成为党所需要的作曲人材，必须关心他们的思想。在创作前我们经常务虚，重视抓创作思想和创作方法，这样同学们在作曲班上不仅学到了业务，而且在思想上也有很大提高。
    目前，我和同学们以及全院同志们一道，正在为我院教学工作的进一步改革继续努力。在党的领导下，我们有信心在一个不长的时间内建成新型的音乐教学体系。
