Grasp Life Like Grasping Production

    The annual summer harvest is about to end. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, our people have won the first round of victory on this year's agricultural front after a difficult battle with various natural disasters last winter and this spring. Now, the vast number of commune members of the rural people's communes are advancing victoriously, making persistent efforts, rushing to plant wheat stubble crops, and grasping the management of autumn fields to win a complete and comprehensive victory in this year's agricultural production.

    The greater the enthusiasm of the masses for production, the more we must care about the lives of the masses. We must seize the favorable opportunity after the summer harvest, grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other, comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses in the same way as comprehensively arranging the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    Comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses, the first thing is to properly arrange the food rations for the masses after the summer harvest. When food rations are arranged well, other things will be easier to handle. For several years, the most important experience in arranging food rations for the masses has been to grasp it early, grasp it well, and grasp it to the end. The earlier you grasp it, the more proactive you are, and the earlier you grasp it, the easier it is to handle. It is better to be tight at the beginning and loose at the end, "saving on the bottom of the granary rather than the top," and never be loose at the beginning and tight at the end. That is to say, when the grain is harvested, we should immediately seize the time, lead the masses to make comprehensive arrangements, make careful calculations, and plan the use of grain; advocate thrift and frugality, continuous flow, and live prosperous days as poor days, and wide days as tight days. Looking ahead and behind in this way, leaving room for maneuver, everyone's life can be good. Our laboring farmers have always had the habit of being diligent and thrifty in managing their families and planning the use of grain. When farmers cook meals on their own, they first make a calculation every year when the grain is harvested, how much to eat every day during the busy farming season, how much to eat every day during the slack farming season, how much adults eat every day, how much children eat every day, and try to adjust it appropriately and make a plan. Since liberation, especially in the past two or three years, China's agricultural production has continued to make great leaps forward, grain output has increased year by year, and the level of grain consumption of farmers has generally improved, and their lives have been greatly improved. With the existing grain, with appropriate arrangements, everyone can live a better life.

    Since 80 to 90 percent of China's rural population has joined public canteens, for the vast majority of residents, grain consumption has changed from a family matter to a collective matter. In collective life, on the basis of certain material conditions, whether the plan is good, whether the arrangement is good, and whether the management is good can often play a decisive role. In the past, during the war years, the supply standards of two companies were completely the same, but due to different levels of management, the food may be good or bad. Now, in some areas, under roughly the same level of grain consumption, most communes and teams manage and use grain well, and the lives of commune members are often full and good, and there is also a surplus of grain; some communes and teams, due to poor management and unplanned use of grain, are sometimes too loose and sometimes too tight, making the lives of commune members sometimes good and sometimes bad. The people's commune is the organizer of large-scale collective production, and also the organizer of the collective life of all members of the commune. The leading cadres of the commune should not only be good at directing the production and labor of thousands of people, but also be good at leading thousands of people to live a good life, managing the use of grain very well, and becoming good stewards for thousands of people.

    Since the vast majority of commune members have joined public canteens, after the grain is arranged well, running public canteens well becomes the key to comprehensively arranging the lives of the masses.

    Since the universal rectification of public canteens in rural areas across the country this spring, they have been getting better and better, and they are increasingly showing their unparalleled superiority. Now what people are talking about is no longer whether to run canteens or whether canteens can be run, but how to run canteens better, and how to summarize and promote the experience of running canteens well. China's rural public canteens have entered a new period of sound development.

    How can we run public canteens well? There are many experiences in various places, the most important of which are two: 1. Cadres eat in the canteen and run the canteen; 2. Resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants. These two points are actually one, which is to solve the problem of who to rely on to run the canteen. When the problem of who to rely on is solved, other specific problems are easier to solve.

    The public canteen is a position of socialism in the countryside, an important aspect of developing a socialist way of life, and an important aspect of consolidating the people's commune. Therefore, to run the public canteen well, we must rely on those in the countryside who love socialism, and hand it over to advanced elements who resolutely support the people's commune to manage, and improve the democratic mess management committee. At present, this is the poor and lower-middle peasants. They regard the commune as their backing and wholeheartedly safeguard it; they regard the public canteen as the iron rice bowl of the people and try every means to run it well. This is because they have learned from their own experience that because they listen to the Party and run the commune well and the canteen well, today's life is much better than yesterday's, and tomorrow's life will be even better. Relying on such people to run the canteen, it is of course easier to implement democratic management, easier to establish family production, and easier to reform cooking utensils and reduce mess management costs. Relying on such people to run the canteen, it is of course easier to achieve planned use of grain and economical use of grain, because they have not only the idea of ​​running the commune thriftily, but also the excellent quality of running all undertakings thriftily, as well as good habits and rich experience in living frugally, and they will try every means to strive to achieve the goal of both improving food and saving grain.

    Cadres are advanced elements among the masses, and the embodiment and representative of the interests and demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Cadres of communes and production teams, and all cadres working in rural areas, should eat, live, and work with the masses, and resolutely run the canteen well. Cadres eat in the public canteen, they will have a deep understanding and personal feelings about the situation and problems of the canteen, and can lead the masses to take measures to help the canteen improve its work. The masses say that cadres eating in the canteen means that the leadership enters the canteen and politics enters the canteen, which is very reasonable. Running the public canteen well, like running all undertakings well, the key to the decision is to realize political leadership and strengthen the leadership of the Party. In addition to the county party committee, the commune party committee, and the production team branch often grasping the canteen, managing the canteen, checking the work of the canteen, and helping the canteen solve various problems, the largest and most frequent leadership is manifested in the cadres eating in the canteen. This is how to run the organ canteen well, and it is even more so to run the rural public canteen well.

    When the lives of the masses are arranged well, the masses will be happier and more motivated, and will promote agricultural production to leap forward at a faster pace. Grasping both production and life is our current important task, and we must do both of these things well.

### 像抓生产一样地抓生活

    像抓生产一样地抓生活
    一年一度的夏收即将结束。我国人民在党和政府正确领导下，在去冬今春，和各种自然灾害进行了艰巨的战斗后赢得了今年农业战线上第一回合的胜利。现在，广大农村人民公社社员正在乘胜直前，再接再厉，抢种麦茬作物，狠抓秋田管理，夺取今年农业生产全年全面的胜利。
    群众的生产劲头越大，越要关心群众的生活。我们必须抓紧夏收后的有利时机，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，像全面安排农林牧副渔生产一样地全面安排群众的生活。
    全面安排群众的生活，首先是要妥善地安排夏收后的群众的口粮。口粮安排好了，别的事情就好办了。几年以来，安排群众口粮最主要的经验，就是要抓早、抓好、抓到底。越早抓越主动，越早抓越好办。宁可前紧后宽，“省囤尖不省囤底”，切勿前松后紧。这就是说，粮食打下来了，应当立即抓紧时间，领导群众全面安排，精打细算，计划用粮；提倡省吃俭用，细水长流，把富日子当穷日子过，宽日子当紧日子过。这样瞻前顾后，留有余地，大家的生活都是可以过好的。我国劳动农民素有勤俭持家、计划用粮的习惯。在农民一家一户烧锅起伙的时候，每年打下粮食，先有一个计算，农忙时每天吃多少，农闲时每天吃多少，大人每天吃多少，孩子每天吃多少，尽量调剂适当，定出一个计划。解放以来，特别是近两三年来，我国农业生产连续大跃进，粮食产量逐年增加，农民的粮食消费水平普遍提高了，生活大大改善了，以现有的粮食，作适当的安排，完全可以使大家的日子过得更好。
    由于我国农村人口的百分之八、九十参加了公共食堂，对绝大多数居民来说，粮食的消费已经由家庭的事情变成集体的事情。在集体生活中，在一定的物质条件的基础上，计划的好不好，安排的好不好，管理的好不好，常常能起决定性的作用。过去，在战争年代，两个连队的供给标准完全相同，但因管理工作水平不同，伙食可能有好有坏。现在，在某些地区，在粮食消费水平大体相同的情况下，大多数社、队粮食管的好，用的好，社员生活经常吃得饱吃得好，粮食也有节余；有的社、队由于管理不好，粮食使用无计划，一时偏松一时偏紧，使社员生活时好时差。人民公社是大规模的集体生产的组织者，也是公社全体成员的集体生活的组织者。公社的领导干部不仅要善于指挥千百人生产劳动，而且要善于领导千百人过好日子，把粮食的使用管理得很好，成为千百人的好管家。
    由于绝大多数社员都参加了公共食堂，粮食安排好了以后，办好公共食堂，就成为全面安排群众生活的关键。
    我国各地农村的公共食堂，自从今年春季普遍整顿以来，越办越好，越来越显示出它的无比的优越性。现在人们谈论的早已不是要不要办食堂，能不能办食堂，而是怎样把食堂办的更好，怎样总结和推广办好食堂的经验。我国农村公共食堂已经进入健全发展的新时期。
    怎样才能把公共食堂办好？各地的经验非常多，其中最重要的是两条：一、干部吃食堂，办食堂；二、坚决依靠贫农和下中农。这两条，其实是一条，就是解决了依靠什么人办食堂的问题。依靠什么人的问题解决了，别的具体问题就比较容易解决。
    公共食堂是社会主义在农村的一个阵地，是发展社会主义生活方式的一个重要方面，也是巩固人民公社的一个重要方面。因此，我们要办好公共食堂，必须依靠农村中热爱社会主义的人，把它交给坚决拥护人民公社的先进分子去管理，健全民主的伙食管理委员会。在目前，这就是贫农和下中农。他们把公社看成自己的靠山，全心全意地维护它；他们把公共食堂看作人民群众的铁饭碗，千方百计地去办好它。这是因为他们从切身经验中体会到了：由于听党的话，把公社办好了，把食堂办好了，今天的生活已经比昨天好了许多，到明天还会生活得更好。依靠这样的人来办食堂，当然就比较容易实行民主管理，比较容易建立家底生产，比较容易改革炊事用具，降低伙食管理费用。依靠这样的人来办食堂，当然也就比较容易作到计划用粮和节约用粮，因为他们既有勤俭办社的思想，又有勤俭办一切事业的优良品质，还有勤俭过日子的良好习惯和丰富经验，他们会千方百计地去争取达到既改善伙食又节约粮食的目的。
    干部是群众中的先进分子，是贫农和下中农的利益和要求的体现者、代表者。公社和生产队的干部，到农村工作的一切干部，都应该跟群众同吃、同住、同劳动，坚决把食堂办好。干部到公共食堂吃饭，对食堂的情况和问题就有了深刻的了解，切身的感受，就可以领导群众，采取措施，帮助食堂改进工作。群众说，干部吃食堂，就是领导进食堂，政治进食堂，这是很有道理的。办好公共食堂，跟办好一切事业一样，决定的关键是实现政治挂帅，加强党的领导。除了县委、公社党委和生产队支部经常抓食堂，管食堂，检查食堂的工作，帮助食堂解决各种问题以外，最大量、最经常的领导，就表现在在食堂吃饭的干部身上。办好机关食堂要这样，办好农村公共食堂更要这样。
    把群众生活安排好，群众心情更舒畅，干劲更高，就会推动农业生产以更快的速度向前跃进。既抓生产，又抓生活，这是我们当前的重要任务，我们一定要把这两件事情全都作好。
