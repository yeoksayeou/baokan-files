Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 21st - According to the Indian Press Trust, the governments of the United States and India signed an agreement here on the 20th to establish an "Indian Investment Center" in New Delhi. The purpose of this organization is to promote the inflow of private foreign capital into India.

It is reported that this center will "create benefits for foreign investors in India," provide "advice to Indian entrepreneurs" on "issues of attracting foreign capital," and "provide assistance to potential foreign investors interested in investing in India."

According to this agreement, the United States will provide "assistance" worth approximately 5,910,000 rupees to this center through the US "Technical Cooperation" delegation.

Recently, a large amount of American private capital has flowed into India, cooperating with India's largest monopoly capital groups. For example, the American capitalist Kaiser recently reached an agreement with Birla, one of India's largest monopoly capitalists, to establish an aluminum plant. According to the Indian Press Trust, the Deputy Minister of Commerce and Industry of India, Chandra, recently revealed after returning from the United States that the capital for establishing nitrogen fertilizer plants by Indian private enterprises may come from American industrialists.

Another way the United States exports capital to India is through bank loans. As of September 30th last year, American banks had provided India with loans totaling 2,819,400,000 rupees, of which 958,400,000 rupees were allocated to the Indian private sector.

A portion of the American "aid" to India is also used to subsidize Indian private enterprises. Earlier, Wood, the Minister for Economic Affairs at the US Embassy in India, claimed that in the ten years since 1951, the US "aid" to India had reached 16.66 billion rupees, of which food accounted for 10.68 billion rupees. Some of the remaining "aid" was used for Indian private enterprises, such as Tata Iron and Steel Company and Indian Martin Burn & Co.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th - Bonn News: A joint West German-Indian communique was released yesterday in the West German capital. The communique stated that West Germany would provide India with another $30 million (approximately 120 million marks) loan.

Prior to this, West Germany had already provided India with $70 million in loans. The joint communique was released at the end of Indian Finance Minister Desai's visit to West Germany.

Desai also said that the issue of protecting West German investments in India is being discussed by the governments of India and West Germany.

    为外国资本流入印度“提供帮助”
    美印两国签订投资协定
    印度又从西德得到三千万美元贷款
    新华社新德里21日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，美国和印度两国政府20日在这里签订了一项关于在新德里建立“印度投资中心”的协定，这个组织的目的是促进外国私人资本流入印度。
    据报道，这个中心将“为外国投资者在印度创造利益”，“就吸引外国资本的问题向印度企业家”提供“建议”，并“为对在印度投资感兴趣的潜在的外国投资者提供帮助”。
    根据这项协定，美国将把价值大约五百九十一万卢比的“援助”通过美国“技术合作”代表团交给这个中心。
    最近来，大量的美国私人资本流入印度，同印度最大的垄断资本集团合作。例如，美国的大资本家凯塞同印度最大的垄断资本家之一比拉最近达成了建立铝厂的协议。据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度工商部副部长钱德拉最近从美国回国后透露，印度私营企业建立氮肥工厂的资本可能来自美国工业家。
    美国向印度输出资本的另一种方式是银行贷款。美国银行到去年9月30日为止已向印度提供了总额为二十八亿一千九百四十万卢比的贷款，其中有九亿五千八百四十万卢比是拨给印度私营部分的。
    美国给印度的“援助”中也有一部分用于资助印度私人企业。早些时候，美国驻印度大使馆的负责经济事务的公使伍德曾经宣称，从1951年以来的十年中，美国给印度的“援助”已达一百六十六亿六千万卢比，其中粮食一项占一百零六亿八千万卢比，其余的“援助”中有些是用于印度私营企业的，例如用于塔塔钢铁公司和印度马丁·伯恩斯钢铁公司的就属于这一类。
    新华社25日讯　波恩消息：昨天在西德首都发表了关于西德—印度的联合公报，公报说，西德将再给印度三千万美元（约合一亿二千万马克）的贷款。
    在这以前，西德已经给印度七千万美元的贷款。这个联合公报是在印度财政部长德赛结束他在西德的访问时发表的。
    德赛还说，关于保护西德在印度的投资的问题正在由印度和西德两国的政府商谈中。
