Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, deeply fearing that requesting Eisenhower to postpone his "visit" to Japan would offend and cause him to fall out of favor with his master, hastily summoned U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, today to meet with him and offer a personal apology. Kishi explained the circumstances surrounding the decision to the U.S. Ambassador, expressing his "apologies" in an obsequious manner.

The U.S. Ambassador consoled Kishi, saying, "I understand the situation in Japan very well. I believe that requesting Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan was also a matter of necessity."

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama announced at a press conference today that the Kishi government intends to send a delegation to Okinawa so that it can express its "apologies" to Eisenhower upon his arrival in Okinawa. It is said that Kishi is also preparing to personally write a letter of "penitence" to take to Okinawa and give to Eisenhower. Fujiyama did not reveal the other missions of this "delegation."

    对人民穷凶极恶　对主子奴颜卑膝
    岸信介当面向美大使陪罪
    并将派代表团去冲绳向艾森豪威尔道歉
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介深恐要求艾森豪威尔延期“访问”日本而得罪和失宠于他的主子，今天连忙把美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二请去会面，当面陪罪。岸信介向美国大使解释决定这件事的经过情形，奴颜卑膝地表示“歉意”。
    美国大使抚慰岸信介说：“我很了解日本国内情况，我认为请求艾森豪威尔延期访日也是迫不得已的。”
    日本外相藤山爱一郎今天在记者招待会上宣布说，岸信介政府打算派遣一个代表团前往冲绳，以便艾森豪威尔到达冲绳时向他表示“歉意”。据说，岸信介还准备亲笔写一封“请罪”的信带到冲绳去交给艾森豪威尔。这个“代表团”的其他使命，藤山没有透露。
