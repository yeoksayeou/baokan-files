    A good idea: Some mechanical factories in Nanjing have linked up with coal mines to help them carry out technological transformations. This is a good way to promote raw material production.
    Generally speaking, it is easier and faster for processing departments to innovate technology and double production, while it is relatively more difficult and slower for raw material production departments, especially mines. This has created a contradiction: the need for raw materials is growing rapidly, while the production capacity of raw materials is rising slowly. At present, solving this new imbalance has become the main task to ensure sustained leaps forward.
    How to solve this contradiction? In addition to building new and expanding existing raw material production enterprises, the main thing is to improve the production level of existing enterprises. For mines, it is necessary to accelerate technological transformation and change manual operation to mechanized or semi-mechanized production.
    An enterprise should mainly rely on itself to mobilize the masses, rely on its own efforts, and carry out a technical innovation movement to carry out technological transformation. However, external assistance is also essential. Especially when it has become a key production issue of common concern to all departments of the national economy, it is even more necessary to concentrate the necessary forces to help it and accelerate its transformation process.
    There are two ways to organize external assistance. One is the administrative method, in which the mine submits an application, the leading agency assigns tasks to other enterprises, and delivers goods according to the contract. The other method is to launch a mass movement, like Nanjing, to organize factory workers to directly link up with mines, help with the transformation, and take full responsibility. Undoubtedly, the latter approach is a faster, better, and more economical approach, and the practice in Nanjing has provided strong proof.
    Nanjing's experience is very practical in the current situation. We suggest that other regions also consider implementing this method, using the power of large-scale cooperation to accelerate the increase in production of raw materials such as ore and coal.

### 好办法

    好办法
    南京的一些机械工厂和煤矿挂钩，帮助煤矿进行技术改造，这是一个促进原材料生产的好办法。
    一般说来，加工部门革新技术、生产翻番，比较容易一些，快一些，而原材料生产部门，特别是矿山，相对地要难一些、慢一些。这就形成了一个矛盾：对原材料的需要增长得快，而原材料的生产能力上升得慢。在目前，解决这个新的不平衡已成为保证持续跃进的主要任务。
    怎样解决这个矛盾呢？除了新建、扩建一批生产原材料的企业外，主要是提高现有企业的生产水平。对矿山来说，就要加速进行技术改造，把手工操作变为机械化、半机械化生产。
    一个企业进行技术改造，主要依靠自己发动群众，自力更生，开展技术革新运动。但是，外力的援助也是必不可少的。特别是当它已成为国民经济各部门共同关心的生产关键时，集中必要的力量来帮助它，加速它的改造进程，就更为必要了。
    组织外力协助，有两种做法。一种是行政的办法，由矿山提出申请，领导机关给别的企业下达任务，按合同交货。一种办法是大搞群众运动，像南京那样，组织工厂的职工直接和矿山挂钩、帮助改造，包干到底。无疑的，后一项做法是多快好省的做法，南京市的实践已经提供了有力的证明。
    南京的经验在当前很有实际意义。我们建议其他地区也考虑实行这个办法，用大协作的力量来加速矿石、煤炭等原材料的增产。
