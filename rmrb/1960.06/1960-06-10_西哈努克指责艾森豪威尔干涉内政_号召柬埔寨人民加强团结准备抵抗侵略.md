Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 9th: According to Cambodian National Radio, Prince Sihanouk pointed out on the 7th that the recent referendum was a victory for all Cambodian people, its neutrality, and its policy of peaceful coexistence.

Sihanouk accused Eisenhower of violating international law by interfering in other people's affairs. He also said that the results of the referendum exposed the slander of Cambodia by them (the United States, South Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) as fabricated. If they continue to do so, no one will believe them.

Sihanouk said that although Cambodia has achieved a great victory in this referendum, its enemies, angered and humiliated by their setbacks and loss of face, will retaliate against Cambodia even more. They will continue to undermine Cambodia's reputation, do everything possible to undermine internal unity, and create instability in Cambodia's domestic life in order to force Cambodia to submit. Sihanouk also said that if the Cambodian people want to achieve more victories, they must strengthen and consolidate unity and prepare to resist aggression. Cambodian soldiers, militiamen, and members of the Royal Socialist Youth League of Cambodia must improve their military knowledge and skills in order to fight the enemy to defend the government and territory. Sihanouk reiterated that Cambodia does not want to be an enemy of any country and hopes to get along with all countries. He hopes that those countries that are hostile to Cambodia will become its friends.

    西哈努克指责艾森豪威尔干涉内政
    号召柬埔寨人民加强团结准备抵抗侵略
    新华社金边9日电　据柬埔寨国家电台说西哈努克亲王7日指出，最近举行的公民投票是柬埔寨全体人民、它的中立及和平共处政策的胜利。
    西哈努克指责艾森豪威尔违反国际法干涉别人的事。他又说，公民投票的结果揭露了他们（美国、南越、泰国等）对柬埔寨的污蔑是捏造的，如果他们再这样干，将没有人相信他们。
    西哈努克说，虽然柬埔寨在这次公民投票中获得很大的胜利，可是它的敌人们因挫折和丢了面子而恼羞成怒，将加倍对柬埔寨进行报复，他们将不断破坏柬埔寨的声誉，千方百计破坏柬埔寨内部的团结，在柬埔寨的国内生活中制造不稳定，以便迫使柬埔寨屈服。西哈努克又说，柬埔寨人民要获得更多的胜利就必须加强和巩固团结并准备抵抗侵略。柬埔寨的士兵、民兵和柬埔寨皇家社会主义青年联盟盟员必须提高自己的军事知识和技术以便为保卫政府和领土而同敌人作战。西哈努克重申，柬埔寨不想同任何国家为敌，它希望同一切国家和好相处。他希望敌视柬埔寨的那些国家变为它的朋友。
