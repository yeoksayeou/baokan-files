Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The following is the full text of the "General Resolution on the First Item on the Agenda" passed by the 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council today:

    I. The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council held in Beijing observed that since the Fourth Congress, socialist forces and world peace forces have achieved enormous development and unprecedented achievements. This development, the upsurge and achievements of the struggle against colonialism and imperialism, and the strength of the movement of workers in capitalist countries to achieve demands, have created objective conditions conducive to strengthening the united struggle of workers to force imperialism to engage in serious negotiations and accept disarmament and peaceful coexistence in order to eliminate the disaster of a world atomic war.

    II. Imperialism, hostile to this progress, facing the intensification of its general crisis, while verbally talking about peace, has intensified its provocative activities and continued war preparations. By sending spy planes into Soviet airspace and shamelessly boasting that it was an established policy, U.S. imperialism has once again affirmed that it is the most ferocious enemy of peace and the people of all countries. It bears full responsibility for sabotaging the summit conference, and it has disappointed the expectations of the people of all countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions and workers around the world condemn these provocative actions by the United States against the Soviet Union, considering them a serious danger to the cause of peace and the interests of the working class of all countries.

    III. Workers will understand better than ever that in the face of the policies adopted by the leading groups of the United States and other Western powers—especially West Germany and Japan—there is an urgent need to strengthen their vigilance. Due to the power of world peace forces, the peaceful policies of the socialist camp, and the series of steps taken by the Soviet Union, it has become truly possible to eliminate the threat of a destructive atomic war, to force imperialism to accept disarmament, and to use the enormous resources now wasted on the arms race for the economic, social, and cultural progress of the people of all countries. However, the situation must be clearly explained to the workers so that they never harbor illusions about the willingness of imperialism to accept disarmament.

    IV. All workers must understand that only through the unremitting, unprecedentedly strong, and more unified struggle of the people of all countries and the isolation of imperialism, the root of war and aggression, is it possible to defeat imperialism's war policy.

    V. The Council warmly welcomes the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on June 2, 1960, aimed at developing and specifying its plan for complete and thorough disarmament, which once again proves the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts for peace, despite the provocations of U.S. leaders.

    VI. These proposals are particularly concerned with prohibiting and destroying, under international supervision, all means of launching nuclear weapons to their targets, linked to the abolition of all military bases on foreign territories, the prohibition of atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, the dissolution of armies, and the abolition of military budgets. The World Federation of Trade Unions Council recommends that trade unions widely inform workers of these proposals so that they actively support them.

    VII. The Council believes that, in this situation, maintaining and consolidating peace remains the basic struggle goal of the international trade union movement. Therefore, it believes that, while exposing the conspiracies of imperialism, unremitting efforts to take joint action are indispensable:
    —To demand the easing of international tensions and peaceful coexistence;
    —To demand complete and thorough disarmament;
    —To demand the abolition of military bases on foreign territories;
    —To demand the cessation of testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons;
    —To demand the national independence of all countries;
    —To demand democracy;
    —To oppose the revival of German militarism and, in order to eliminate militarism, to sign peace treaties with the two Germanys; to turn West Berlin into a free, demilitarized city;
    —To oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and to demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military treaty.

    VIII. The Council reiterates the close link between the struggle to ease international tensions and the struggle against colonialism and against imperialism for independence. The Council expresses its respect and support for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence. The Council calls on workers and their trade unions to strengthen their active support for the struggle of their Algerian brothers, demanding that the French government stop the colonial war in Algeria. The Council expresses its respect and warm support for the struggle of the Turkish people and the uprising of the South Korean people that led to the downfall of Syngman Rhee. The ongoing struggle of the Korean people will force the withdrawal of U.S. troops and promote the peaceful reunification of the country. The Council expresses its full support for the powerful movement launched by Japanese workers and people to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, oppose the revival of militarism, and demand the abolition of military bases. The Council expresses its warm support to the workers and trade unions of Venezuela, Argentina, and Chile, especially to the people of Cuba who are heroically and unitedly defending the economic and social achievements of the people's democratic revolution and defending the sovereignty of the country.

    IX. After studying the economic situation of capitalist countries, the Council noted that its main characteristics are the increasing militarization of the economy, the further concentration of monopoly capital, and the significant increase in productivity achieved through intensified labor and automation, which only benefits monopoly capital. The recovery after the 1958-1959 crisis has not reduced unemployment, which is long-term in some countries and generally at a high level, especially in some important industrial sectors.

    X. Monopoly capital groups and the governments that serve them are attacking the purchasing power of wages, trade union rights, and freedom rights. Thousands of trade union leaders have been arrested and imprisoned. In Greece, Spain, Argentina, and other countries, tens of thousands of strikers have been suppressed by the police and punished by capitalists. In some countries, such as the Union of South Africa, workers and people are subjected to barbaric racial oppression.

    XI. The Council reminds everyone of the fact that while attacking trade unions, some new laws are being passed that attempt to legalize violations of the basic rights stipulated in the Charter of Workers' Trade Union Rights adopted by the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1954, including the right to strike.

    XII. The intensification of the general crisis of the capitalist world stands in increasingly stark contrast to the unprecedented upsurge in the economy, society, science, and culture of all socialist countries where the people are masters of their own affairs; this upsurge in socialist countries has liberated social productive forces, enabling continuous and significant increases in purchasing power and improving working conditions, social welfare, and the entire living standards of the masses. Workers around the world attach importance to the significance of the recent measures taken by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, namely, announcing the expansion of the implementation of the six- and seven-hour workday, gradually reducing income tax for employees over six years, and expanding the role and rights of trade union organizations in socialist countries.

    XIII. The Council warmly congratulates the men and women workers of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, for the great achievements they have made in the economic and social fields. Due to their creative enthusiasm, the socialist system is gaining victories that are more and more important year by year, and these victories are the victories of the working class and the cause of peace throughout the world.

    XIV. The Council pays tribute to the millions of workers and trade unions in capitalist countries who are carrying out particularly strong joint struggles to fight for wages, shorten working hours, and defend trade union rights. In the past three years, the strike movement in Argentina, Japan, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, and other countries has reached a considerable scale rarely seen since the last war. This scale shows the sharpening of the class struggle during this period, the desire for unity, and the high combativeness of the working class. This evolution completely negates the theory of class cooperation that monopoly capital and some trade union leaders constantly spread among workers in order to make them abandon their struggles. Workers should expose and reject all attempts to guide the trade union movement towards class cooperation and strengthen joint action, seeking:
    —To shorten working hours without reducing wages;
    —To generally increase wages;
    —The right to work, guaranteed employment, and relief for unemployment;
    —The establishment, protection, and expansion of social security systems;
    —To defend trade union rights and freedoms;
    —To limit the power of monopoly groups;
    These demands will enable new progress to be made in unified action.

    XV. The Council recommends that all workers and trade unions strengthen actions to fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms and to fight for the release of all arrested trade union workers.

    XVI. In order to help raise the indispensable common front of workers and trade unions to the international level to deal with these attacks, the Council instructs the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to study with the relevant organizations the establishment of an international trade union committee to defend and protect those who have been victimized by the suppression of trade unions.

    XVII. The Council also noted that the demand for universal shortening of working hours and the demand for the implementation of a forty-hour work week in highly industrialized capitalist countries have been consistently put forward by various organizations. These demands are in line with the vital and increasingly urgent demands of the working class. On this basis, and in order to promote the unity of trade union and worker forces in the context of monopoly concentration in the Common Market, the Council instructs the Secretariat to convene a European trade union conference on the forty-hour work week in the first quarter of 1961. Trade union central organizations from other continents should also be invited to attend this conference in order to subsequently popularize the experience gained.

    XVIII. In view of the attacks on social insurance systems in many capitalist countries and the need to improve existing systems, the Council decided to convene a broad international trade union action committee meeting on social insurance. The purpose of this committee is to promote new developments in unified action and international solidarity on this issue.

    XIX. The Council notes with satisfaction that while the struggle to meet demands is surging forward, significant progress has been made in unified action in various capitalist countries. Workers are increasingly understanding from their own experience that their struggles will be more effective when they unite at the grassroots level and take joint action to achieve clear common goals. Discussion and formulation of demands that best meet their needs in the local situation with the workers themselves at the local, regional, and national levels is a necessary condition for achieving unified action, which requires all organizations to become increasingly proactive.

    XX. Solidarity is consolidated on a class basis, in action, and through action. This solidarity must be realized in a clear manner, constantly exposing the excuses and conspiracies of the enemies of solidarity through facts. Due to the development of unified action in various capitalist countries and the alliance against monopoly capital, positive developments favorable to solidarity have emerged on an international scale.

    XXI. Despite the stubborn opposition of some leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the view that meetings and talks between national and international trade union organizations of various tendencies are possible and indispensable today is increasingly accepted by more and more trade union leaders, especially those middle-level cadres of trade unions that do not belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    XXII. Trade union organizations are seeking the best ways in bilateral and multilateral contacts to jointly deal with the main problems faced by workers in the struggle against imperialism and monopoly capital:
    —Defending peace;
    —The struggle against colonialism;
    —Major economic and social demands;
    —Taking joint action against monopoly capital at the national and international levels;
    —The struggle for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

    XXIII. The Council particularly welcomes and endorses the activities of the Liaison Action Committee of the Common Market countries and the steps taken by the International Trade Union Support Committee for Algerian Workers and People. Mutual visits by trade union delegations between capitalist and socialist countries, as well as between capitalist countries themselves, and the signing of bilateral and multilateral agreements between trade union organizations of different affiliations as advocated by the Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, have increased significantly in recent years.

    XXIV. The Council welcomes the fact that, despite the enormous obstacles created by some leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the trend towards trade union unity is strengthening throughout the continents of Africa and Latin America. It condemns the leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions for stubbornly refusing to respond to the World Federation of Trade Unions' many proposals over the past decade for joint action at the international level to defend peace, more effectively support national independence movements, and meet the vital economic and social demands of workers.

    XXV. The Council calls on all workers and trade unions to continue and strengthen mutual visits by delegations between trade unions, national trade unions, and federations, as well as bilateral and multilateral contacts, in order to strengthen joint action to fight for peace, to fight for the satisfaction of demands, to fight for trade union freedom, and to eliminate colonialism.

    XXVI. The Council urges workers and trade unions to hold conferences and meetings this year, the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to celebrate this festival by recalling the birth of the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945 in the common struggle of workers and people around the world against fascism and for lasting peace.

    XXVII. The World Federation of Trade Unions Council is convinced that this meeting will help strengthen the unity of the working class and trade unions of all countries in struggle.

### 世界工联理事会第十一次会议  关于第一项议程的总决议

    世界工联理事会第十一次会议
    关于第一项议程的总决议
    新华社9日讯　世界工联理事会第十一次会议今天通过的“关于第一项议程的总决议”，全文如下：
    一、在北京举行的世界工联理事会第十一次会议看到，自从第四次代表大会举行以来，社会主义力量与世界和平力量取得了巨大的发展和空前的成就。这种发展和反对殖民主义、帝国主义斗争的高涨和成就以及资本主义国家争取实现要求的运动的力量，创造了有利于加强工人为迫使帝国主义进行认真的谈判和接受裁军和和平共处以便消除一次世界原子大战的灾难的统一斗争的客观条件。
    二、敌视这种进展的帝国主义，面临着它们的总危机的加剧，一方面口头上说要和平，却加紧了挑衅活动和继续进行战争准备。美帝国主义者派遣间谍飞机到苏联领空并可耻地吹嘘那是一个既定政策，这样，美帝国主义就再一次肯定了它是和平和各国人民的最凶恶的敌人。它对破坏最高级会议负有全部责任，它辜负了各国人民的期待。世界工联和全世界工人谴责美国对苏联的这些挑衅行动，认为这是对和平事业和所有国家工人阶级的利益严重危害。
    三、工人们将比以往任何时候都更好地了解，面对着美国和其他西方大国——特别西德和日本——领导集团所采取的政策，迫切地需要加强他们的警惕性。由于世界和平力量的威力，由于社会主义阵营的和平政策和苏联所采取的一系列的步骤，已经真正有可能排除破坏性的原子战争的威胁，强迫帝国主义接受裁军，并把现在浪费在军备竞赛上的巨大资源用于各国人民的经济、社会和文化进步。但是，必须向工人们清楚地说明形势，以便他们对于帝国主义接受裁军的愿望，决不抱有幻想。
    四、必须使所有的工人懂得，只有通过世界各国人民不懈的、空前强大的和更为统一的斗争以及作为战争和侵略的根源帝国主义的孤立，才有可能使帝国主义的战争政策失败。
    五、理事会热烈欢迎苏联在1960年6月2日提出的新建议，提出新建议的目的是发展它的全面彻底裁军计划并使它具体化，这就又一次证明了，不顾美国领导人的挑衅，苏联为了和平所做的不懈努力。
    六、这些建议特别关系到在国际监督下禁止并毁灭一切把核武器发向它们的目标的手段，联系到取消在外国领土上的一切军事基地，禁止原子、化学和细菌武器，解散军队，取消军事预算。世界工联理事会建议各工会把这些建议广泛地告诉工人，以便他们积极支持这些建议。
    七、理事会认为，在这种情况下，维护和巩固和平依然是国际工会运动基本斗争的目标。因此，它认为，在揭露帝国主义阴谋活动的同时，为采取共同行动而不懈地努力是不可少的：
    ——要求缓和国际局势和和平共处；
    ——要求全面彻底裁军；
    ——要求取消在外国领土上的军事基地；
    ——要求停止试验并禁止核武器；
    ——要求各国人民的民族独立；
    ——要求民主；
    ——反对复活德国军国主义，并且为了消灭军国主义，同两个德国签订和约；把西柏林变成一个自由、非军事化的城市；
    ——反对复活日本军国主义并要求废止日美军事条约。
    八、理事会再次指出争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争和反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义以争取独立的斗争之间的密切联系。理事会向阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的英勇斗争表示敬意和支持。理事会号召工人们和他们的工会加强对阿尔及利亚兄弟的斗争的积极支援，要求法国政府停止在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。理事会对土耳其人民的斗争和对导致李承晚倒台的南朝鲜人民起义表示敬意和热烈的支持。在继续中的朝鲜人民的斗争将迫使美国军队撤退和促进这个国家的和平统一。理事会对日本工人和人民为争取废除日美军事同盟条约，反对军国主义的复活和争取取消军事基地而展开的强大运动表示全力支持。理事会对委内瑞拉、阿根廷、智利的工人和工会，特别是对英勇地和团结一致地保卫人民民主革命的经济和社会成就和保卫国家的主权的古巴人民表示热烈的支援。
    九、理事会在研究了资本主义国家的经济形势以后，注意到它的主要特点是经济的日益军事化，垄断资本的进一步集中，和通过加强劳动强度和自动化而取得的生产率的显著提高，仅仅有利于垄断资本。1958—1959年的危机以后的复苏，不能减少失业，失业在某些国家是长期的并且一般的处于很高水平，特别是在某些重要的工业部门中。
    十、垄断资本集团和为它们服务的政府正在向工资的购买力、工会权利和自由权利进攻。几千名工会领袖被逮捕和监禁。在希腊、西班牙、阿根廷及其他国家里，成千上万罢工者遭到警察的镇压和受到资本家的惩罚。在某些国家里，如在南非联邦，工人和人民遭到野蛮的种族压迫。
    十一、理事会提醒大家注意这样的事实，就是在反对工会的进攻的同时，一些新的法律被通过，这些法律企图使违反世界工联在1954年通过的工人工会权利宪章所规定的基本权利，包括罢工的权利成为合法化。
    十二、资本主义世界的总危机的加剧，同人民当家作主的一切社会主义国家在经济、社会、科学文化等方面的空前高涨形成了愈来愈显著的对照；社会主义国家的这种高涨解放了社会生产力，使购买力得以不断的、显著的提高，工作条件、社会福利和人民群众的整个生活水平得以改善。全世界工人重视苏联最高苏维埃最近采取的措施的重要性，即宣布扩大实施六、七小时工作日，在六年内逐步减少职工的所得税，以及扩大社会主义国家的工会组织的作用和权利。
    十三、理事会热烈祝贺社会主义国家，特别是苏联和中国的男女工人在经济和社会方面所获得的巨大成就。由于他们的创造性的热情，社会制度获得一年比一年更为重要的胜利，这些胜利是全世界工人阶级和和平事业的胜利。
    十四、理事会向资本主义国家的千百万工人和工会致敬，他们为争取工资、缩短工作时间和保卫工会权利进行着特别强大联合斗争。在过去的三年中，罢工运动在阿根廷、日本、美国、法国、意大利、比利时及其他国家中达到了上次大战以来罕见的可观的规模。这种规模表明了这个时期阶级斗争的尖锐化、要求团结的愿望和工人阶级高度的战斗性。这个演变完全否定了垄断资本和某些工会领导人为了使工人放弃他们的斗争而在他们中间不断散布的阶级合作的理论。工人们应该揭发并摒弃把工会运动导向阶级合作的立场的一切企图，并加强共同行动，谋求：
    ——缩短工作时间而不降低工资；
    ——普遍增加工资；
    ——工作权利、保障就业和救济失业；
    ——社会安全制度的建立、保护与扩大；
    ——保卫工会权利和自由；
    ——限制垄断集团的权力；
    这些要求将使统一行动取得新的进展。
    十五、理事会建议所有的工人和工会加强争取工会权利和民主自由的行动，争取释放一切被捕的工会工作者。
    十六、为了帮助把工人和工会的必不可缺的共同阵线提高到国际水平以对付这些进攻，理事会责成世界工联书记处与各有关组织研究设立一个国际工会委员会，以捍卫和保护由于镇压工会而受害的人。
    十七、理事会还注意到，普遍的缩短劳动时间的要求与高度工业化的资本主义国家中实行四十小时工作周的要求，已一致为各种组织所提出。这些要求是符合工人阶级的切身与愈益紧迫的要求的。在这一基础上，并为了在共同市场垄断集中的情况下促进工会和工人力量的团结，理事会责成书记处在1961年第一季度召开一次争取四十小时工作周的欧洲工会会议。其他大陆的工会中央组织也应被邀出席这一会议，以便随后普及所获得的经验。
    十八、鉴于在很多资本主义国家中对社会保险制度的进攻和鉴于现有的制度有必要加以改进，理事会决定召开一次广泛的国际工会社会保险行动委员会会议。这个委员会的目的是为了在这个问题上促进统一行动和国际团结的新发展。
    十九、理事会满意地注意到最近在争取满足要求的斗争汹涌澎湃地掀起的同时，各资本主义国家在统一行动方面取得了重大进展。工人们根据本身的经验日益理解到当他们在基层团结起来，采取共同行动来争取实现明确的共同目标时，那么他们的斗争就会获得更多的效果。在地方、地区和全国范围内同工人们自己进行讨论和制定，在当时当地情况下最切合他们需要的要求，是实现统一行动的必要条件，这要求所有的组织越来越主动。
    二十、团结是在阶级的基础上，在行动中和通过行动得到巩固的。必须以明确的方式来实现这种团结，通过事实来不断揭露团结的敌人的借口和阴谋。由于各资本主义国家中统一行动发展和为了反对垄断资本的同盟，已在国际范围里出现有利于团结的积极发展。
    二十一、尽管国际自由工联某些领导人顽固地反对，这样一个看法在越来越多的工会领导人、特别是那些不属于世界工联的工会的中层干部中愈来愈得到接受，即：各种倾向的全国性和国际性的工会组织之间进行会见和晤谈，今天是可能的和必不可少的。
    二十二、各工会组织正在双边和多边接触中寻求最好的办法来共同对付工人们在反对帝国主义和垄断资本的斗争中所面临的主要问题：
    ——保卫和平；
    ——反对殖民主义的斗争；
    ——主要的经济和社会要求；
    ——在全国和国际范围内采取联合行动反对垄断资本；
    ——争取工会权利和民主自由权的斗争。
    二十三、理事会特别欢迎和赞同共同市场各国联络行动委员会的活动和国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人人民委员会所采取的步骤。资本主义国家和社会主义国家之间，以及资本主义国家相互之间工会代表团进行互访，以及世界工联第四届代表大会所主张的所属不同的各工会组织间签订双边和多边协定，近年来显著地增加了。
    二十四、理事会欢迎这一情况：尽管国际自由工联某些领导人制造巨大的障碍，工会统一的倾向在非洲、拉丁美洲等整个大陆上正在加强。它谴责国际自由工联的领导顽固地拒绝答复世界工联将近十年来向它提出的为保卫和平、更有效的支持民族独立运动，和满足工人们切身的经济和社会要求而在国际范围内采取联合行动的许多建议。
    二十五、理事会号召所有工人和工会为了加强争取和平、争取满足要求，争取工会自由和消灭殖民主义的共同行动，继续和加强各工会，全国性工会和联合会之间代表团进行互访以及进行双边与多边的接触。
    二十六、理事会敦请工人和工会在世界工联成立第十五周年的今年举行大会和会议，回忆一下1945年世界工联在全世界工人和人民为反对法西斯和争取持久和平所进行的共同斗争中诞生的情况，以志庆祝这个节日。
    二十七、世界工联理事会深信这次会议将有助于加强各国工人阶级和工会在斗争中的团结。　1960年6月9日于北京
