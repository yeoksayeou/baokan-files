Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 17th: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial today stating that the Japanese people did not allow Eisenhower to visit Japan, and their angry protests blocked the path of this "unwelcome guest."

The editorial said that the Japanese government was forced to cancel Eisenhower's visit, which is a heavy blow to the aggressive plans of the American and Japanese reactionaries. The era when the American ruling group arbitrarily controlled the fate of other countries that were dragged into military blocs and occupied by the American military is gone forever. The American ruling group is now reaping the bitter fruit of its aggressive policies. One after another, American puppet regimes have collapsed. The Kishi Nobusuke government is also on the verge of collapse. As the Eastern proverb says: A drowning man clutches at a snake. Kishi Nobusuke tried to grab the American president, but this was all in vain.

The editorial concluded that Japan's progressive forces are wholeheartedly continuing the struggle against militarism, against turning their country into an American rocket-nuclear base, and against suppression and terror. The Japanese people, together with the people of other countries around the world, are resolutely fighting for peace and against the American occupiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 17th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today on Eisenhower being forced to postpone his "visit" to Japan, saying that this is a preliminary victory for the Japanese people in their struggle to crush the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, a running dog of American imperialism, and prevent Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

The commentary also said that this is also a heavy blow to the American imperialists and the Kishi Nobusuke group, who are attempting to turn Japan into an aggressive logistics base and are frantically preparing for a new war in Asia, as well as to the puppets and reactionary forces that are dependent on American imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that the Japanese people have demonstrated the power of unity through arduous, long-term, and heroic struggles. It also proves that as long as the people are firmly united and fight, they can thwart the sinister attempts of imperialist war forces.

The commentary said that it is now even clearer that the American imperialists' cannons and tanks have not been able to save its lackeys Syngman Rhee and Menderes, and there is no way to save the bankruptcy of the Kishi Nobusuke government. The commentary demanded: "The American imperialists get out of South Korea, out of Japan, out of Taiwan, out of South Vietnam, and out of the areas where it has gone immediately! If it doesn't leave on its own, the people will definitely drive it out."

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 17th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary today saying: The mass movement of the Japanese people is of such a huge scale that it finally forced the Kishi Nobusuke government to cancel Eisenhower's visit to Japan. This failure of the American government is an inevitable result of American policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 17th: The Hungarian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 17th stating that the bankruptcy of Eisenhower's trip to Japan is a new and extremely heavy failure of American policy.

The editorial said that the powerful protest movement of the Japanese people dealt a fatal blow to Eisenhower's plan to "visit" Japan. The American government's huge travel plan for Eisenhower has been completely shattered.

The editorial concluded that the Kishi Nobusuke government was forced to postpone Eisenhower's visit to Japan in an attempt to calm down future protests, but he is still trying to approve the U.S.-Japan treaty as soon as possible and will continue to take new violent measures to extinguish the mass movement of the people. However, the Japanese people are determined to fight bravely. The victory that has been achieved now will undoubtedly give new strength to their protest movement. The Japanese people are continuing to fight for the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the rejection of the Japan-U.S. military treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 17th: The "People's Daily" published an editorial today commenting on the news of Eisenhower's postponed visit to Japan.

The editorial said that this is a great victory for the Japanese people and proves that the unity of the people's power can destroy any "fortress."

The editorial pointed out that the purpose of Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke in postponing Eisenhower's trip to Japan is obviously to avoid the "decisive struggle" that the Japanese people will launch on June 19. The editorial warned that if Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke believe that they can make the Japanese people give up their basic demands – Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and the cancellation of the "Security Treaty" – they will definitely be disappointed.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Rome Dispatch: Yesterday, the Italian Communist Party's organ "L'Unità" published an editorial on the Japanese people's general strike and mass demonstration on the 15th, praising the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism, for peace, and to defend national sovereignty.

The editorial wrote that American imperialism, especially in Asia, is pursuing a shameless policy of provocation, and the people of all countries who oppose this policy are constantly fighting.

The editorial said that peace and relaxation can only be guaranteed by completely overthrowing and defeating the imperialist aggression plan. It pointed out that the people of all countries in the world must defeat imperialism and force imperialism to retreat.

    各国舆论评艾森豪威尔延期访日
    美日反动派受到了沉重打击
    苏联“真理报”说
    美国统治集团自食侵略政策恶果
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表社论说，日本人民不允许艾森豪威尔访问日本，他们的愤怒抗议堵绝了这位“不速之客”的道路。
    社论说，日本政府被迫取消艾森豪威尔访问，这是对美日反动派的侵略计划的沉重打击。美国统治集团任意支配被拉进军事集团和被美军占领的其他国家的命运的时代已经一去不复返了。美国统治集团现在正自食其侵略政策的恶果。美国的傀儡政权一个接一个地垮了台。岸信介政府也处在崩溃的边缘。正如东方谚语所说：溺水者攀蟒求生。岸信介企图抓住美国总统，但是，这全然无济于事。
    社论最后说，日本的进步力量一心一意地继续着反对军国主义、反对把自己的国家变成美国的火箭—核基地、反对镇压和恐怖的斗争。日本人民和世界其他各国人民一道，坚决地争取和平，反对美国占领者。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    美帝国主义挽救不了岸信介
    据新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天就艾森豪威尔被迫延期“访问”日本发表评论说，这是日本人民为粉碎侵略性的日美军事同盟条约、打倒美帝国主义的走狗岸信介政府、阻止艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的斗争所取得的初步胜利。
    评论又说，同时，这也是对企图把日本变成侵略性的兵站基地，在亚洲疯狂地准备新战争的美帝国主义和岸信介集团以及依附美帝国主义的傀儡和反动势力的沉重的打击。
    评论指出，日本人民通过艰苦的、长期的、英勇的斗争显示了团结的威力。同时也证明，只要人民牢固地团结进行斗争，就能够挫折帝国主义战争势力的凶恶的企图。
    评论说，现在更加清楚的是：美帝国主义者的大炮和坦克没有能够挽救它的奴才李承晚和曼德列斯，而且也没有办法挽救岸信介政府的破产。评论要求：“美帝国主义者从南朝鲜、从日本、从台湾、从南越以及它所到的地区立即滚出去！如果它自己不走，人民就一定要把它赶走。”
    波兰“人民论坛报”说
    美国政策的失败是不可避免的
    新华社华沙17日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天发表评论说：日本人民群众的运动具有如此巨大的规模，终于迫使岸信介政府取消艾森豪威尔对日本的访问。美国政府的这个失败，是美国政策的不可避免的结果。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”说
    日本人民的斗争得到了新的力量
    新华社布达佩斯17日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”17日发表社论说，艾森豪威尔日本之行的破产，是美国政策的一个新的、异常惨重的失败。
    社论说，日本人民威力巨大的抗议运动，给了艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的计划以致命的打击。美国政府为艾森豪威尔所作的庞大的旅行计划被彻底粉碎了。
    社论最后说，岸信介政府被迫推迟艾森豪威尔对日本的访问，是企图使今后的抗议活动平静下来，但他仍然企图及早批准美日条约，并且会继续采取新的暴力措施来扑灭人民群众运动。但是，日本人民是具有勇敢地进行斗争的决心的。现在所取得的胜利无疑地将给他们的抗议运动以新的力量。日本人民正继续为推翻岸信介政府和拒绝日美军事条约而进行着斗争。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说
    人民的力量能摧毁任何“堡垒”
    新华社雅加达17日电　“人民日报”今天发表社论评艾森豪威尔延期访问日本的消息。
    社论说，这是日本人民的伟大胜利，并且证明，人民力量的团结能够摧毁任何“堡垒”。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔和岸信介推迟艾森豪威尔的日本之行的目的显然是要躲过日本人民将在6月19日发动的“决定性斗争”。社论警告说，如果艾森豪威尔和岸信介认为，他们这样做会使日本人民放弃他们的基本要求——岸信介下台和取消“安全条约”，他们肯定会失望。
    意大利“团结报”说
    各国人民必须强迫帝国主义退却
    新华社17日讯　罗马消息：昨天，意大利共产党机关报“团结报”就日本人民15日的总罢工和大示威发表社论，赞扬日本人民反对帝国主义、争取和平和保卫国家主权的斗争。
    社论写道，美帝国主义，特别是在亚洲，奉行着一种无耻的挑衅政策，反对这种政策的各国人民都在不断地进行斗争。
    社论说，只有把帝国主义的侵略计划彻底推翻和打倒，和平和缓和才有可能得到保证。它指出世界各国人民必须打倒帝国主义，强迫帝国主义退却。
