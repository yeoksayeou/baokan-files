Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: With the arrival of summer, all parts of the country are strengthening flood prevention work. In order to strengthen leadership over flood prevention work in various regions, the Central Flood Control Headquarters has now officially resumed operations, and flood control organizations in various regions have also resumed operations one after another according to the flood situation in each region. Starting from June 1st, all major rivers in China, including the Huai River, the Yellow River, the Hai River system, and the Liao River and Songhua River in the Northeast, have begun to report flood conditions daily.

The National Flood Prevention Work Conference held in late April already deployed national flood prevention work. Due to the great achievements in river management and farmland water conservancy construction, and the achievements in soil and water conservation work in various regions, the area of ​​soil erosion that has been initially controlled has increased, and experience has been accumulated in flood prevention work, and flood prevention capabilities have been enhanced. However, due to the construction of a large number of new water conservancy projects, the scope of flood prevention is larger, and the flood prevention task is more arduous. The national flood prevention work has changed from flood prevention on the river lines to flood prevention on the vast mountainous and plain areas. In particular, preventing mountain floods and flood prevention for millions of large, medium, and small reservoirs is the focus of this year's flood prevention work. This year's flood prevention must not only ensure the safety of river embankments but also ensure the safety of a large number of reservoir projects. The flood prevention preparations in various regions are being prepared in accordance with this spirit. Rural people's communes in various regions have trained a large number of hydrological and flood prevention personnel for this purpose, and many regions are continuing to train flood prevention personnel.

The southern provinces and regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan have entered the flood season before the start of summer. In April and May, the Han River in Guangdong, the Xiang River and Yuan River in Hunan, and the Jiulong River in Fujian have all experienced relatively large flood peaks. The tense flood prevention work in various parts of the South has already begun. Flood prevention preparations in various parts of the South were also made relatively early, with Guangdong and Fujian starting preparations in February and March this year. The dikes and weirs in the Dongjiang River in Guangdong have been generally inspected, reinforced, raised, and thickened. The earth and stone work for the dike and weir reinforcement project in the Pearl River Delta alone reached more than 40 million cubic meters, and the hidden dangers of the North River levee have also been dealt with. Warehouses for flood prevention materials have also been established in key areas along the dikes, and projects such as flood prevention pavilions and flood rescue roads have been built. Fujian has also generally renovated and reinforced river dikes and seawalls, improving the ability to defend against floods.

As the peak summer flood season arrives, under the leadership of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, various regions are further conducting inspections of flood prevention preparations, inspecting projects, inspecting organizations, and inspecting equipment and materials; especially inspecting the flood prevention preparations of key projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th dispatch: Under the guidance of the idea that "man will conquer nature," the people of Hunan Province are further strengthening flood prevention work. According to meteorological forecasts, the rainfall in Hunan in June will be higher than in previous years. The provincial leading organs require all regions to pay attention to some new changes in the laws of water flow in the lake area, especially since some newly built dikes and reservoirs have not yet been tested by major floods, and water conservancy projects in mountainous and hilly areas are widely distributed. All regions are required to strengthen this year's flood prevention work based on these new situations. The flood prevention inspection teams sent by the Provincial Party Committee have gone deep into various regions to conduct serious inspections, and problems are dealt with in a timely manner.

At present, various regions are vigorously rushing to transport flood prevention equipment and materials, and continue to reinforce dangerous dike sections and reservoir ponds and dams. All counties in the lake area have divided the defense scope according to the water flow and dike system, and each commune has organized crack flood prevention teams with production brigades as units. In addition to establishing flood control organizations in mountainous and hilly areas, each reservoir, pond, and dam is assigned a fixed observer responsible for mastering the water situation. Liuyang County inspected and found that four reservoirs within its territory had not yet opened spillways and immediately organized manpower to rush to dig them; and adopted measures such as sorting out spillways, opening ditches, and building gully weirs to divert the main stream of reservoirs with large water storage areas, change rapid water into slow water, in order to reduce the pressure of mountain floods on the reservoirs and ensure safety.

Since April and May, due to excessive rainfall, the water levels of some rivers in Hunan Province have exceeded the warning line. In order to overcome water disasters and ensure a bumper harvest, various regions have actively launched flood prevention struggles under the leadership of the Party. Commune members in Changde County put forward the slogan "Every second counts, every seedling must be protected, no waterlogging even after 300 millimeters of heavy rain," and concentrated drainage machinery to rush to drain the accumulated water in the dikes. All the communes bordering the lake in Xiangyin County have completed preparations for wave prevention.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th dispatch: Gansu Province is concentrating its efforts to complete a number of key reservoir projects before the flood season, striving to bring the benefits of the projects into play early, increase drought resistance and flood prevention capabilities, and expand the irrigated area of ​​summer and autumn fields.

Gansu Province has started construction on many reservoirs this year, with large capacities. The planned storage capacity to be completed is equal to four times the original storage capacity. At present, the summer flood season is approaching. All localities have conducted a thorough investigation and ranking of reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than one million cubic meters that are under construction, according to the project progress of each reservoir, workload, labor, time, work efficiency, equipment supply, and hydrological conditions, and have reorganized the labor force. All the canal, well, and reservoir projects that have been completed and can be temporarily postponed have been suspended, and manpower has been drawn out to support key projects. Efforts are being made to complete the construction before the arrival of floods, or to repair the dam to the flood control standard, in order to increase the drought resistance and flood prevention capabilities of summer and autumn crops.

In order to ensure the timely completion of key projects, all projects have implemented the method of secretary in charge of the reservoir and graded responsibility. The Provincial Party Committee decided that the county party committee is responsible for reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than one million cubic meters and less than ten million cubic meters; the prefectural and state party committees are responsible for those with a storage capacity of more than ten million cubic meters and less than one hundred million cubic meters; and the prefectural committee and the provincial party committee are jointly responsible for those with a storage capacity of more than one hundred million cubic meters. The implementation of the secretary in charge of the reservoir in the Tianshui Special District has greatly promoted the progress of the project. All departments of industry, transportation, finance and trade, and culture and education in the province have also contributed to accelerating the construction of reservoirs. The Third Engineering Bureau of Lanzhou Urban Construction and the Pingliang Municipal Bureau of Commerce and other departments actively cleared warehouses and inventories, cleared out more than 10,000 pieces of various reservoir construction site equipment and sent them to the construction site.

    发动群众　充分准备　提早防汛
    各主要河流开始报汛　大中小水库成为防汛工作重点
    湖南各地深入检查防汛准备工作　甘肃抓紧汛前时机突击水库工程
    新华社12日讯　随着夏季到来，全国各地都加强了防汛工作。为了加强对各地防汛工作的领导，中央防汛总指挥部现在已经正式恢复办公，各地的防汛组织也都根据各地汛情陆续恢复办公。从6月1日起，我国所有主要河流，包括淮河、黄河、海河水系各河和东北的辽河和松花江都已开始逐日报汛。
  　早在4月下旬举行的全国防汛工作会议，就部署了全国的防汛工作。由于江河治理和农田水利建设成就巨大，各地水土保持工作也获得成绩，初步控制的水土流失面积有所增加，防汛工作也积累了经验，防汛能力有所增强。但是，由于新修了大量的水利工程，防汛的面更大，防汛任务也更加艰巨。全国防汛工作已由各江河线上的防汛，变成广大山区和平原面上的防汛。特别是防止山洪和千百万大中小水库的防汛，是今年防汛工作的重点。今年防汛不仅要保证江河堤防安全，还要保证大量水库工程的安全。各地的防汛准备工作都是根据这个精神来进行准备的。各地农村人民公社为此训练了大批水文、防汛的人员，很多地区还继续在训练防汛人员。
    南方广东、广西、福建、浙江、江西、湖南等省区在入夏以前就已进入汛期。4、5月间，广东韩江、湖南湘江、沅江、福建九龙江等河流都曾出现过较大的洪峰。南方各地的紧张的防汛工作早已开始。南方各地的防汛准备工作也作得比较早，广东、福建今年2、3月间就已开始准备。广东东江堤圩都普遍进行过检查和培修加高、加厚，仅珠江三角洲的堤圩培修工程的土石方就达四千多万立方米，北江大堤的隐患也都作了处理。沿堤重点地区还建立了防汛器材的仓库，修了防汛亭和防汛抢险道路等工程。福建也普遍整修加固了江堤和海塘，提高了防御洪水的能力。
    由于夏季大汛时期到来，在中央防汛总指挥部的领导下，各地正在进一步作防汛准备的检查工作，检查工程、检查组织，检查器材物资；特别是检查重点工程的防汛准备。
    新华社长沙12日电　湖南省人民在“人定胜天”的思想指导下，正进一步加强防汛工作。根据气象预报，湖南6月份的雨量比往年多。省的领导机关要求各地注意湖区水流规律出现的一些新变化，特别是有些新修的大堤和水库还没有经过大汛的考验，山区、丘陵区水利工程散布面很广，要求各地根据这些新情况来加强今年的防汛工作。省委派出的防汛防洪检查团，已深入各地认真检查，发现问题就及时处理。
    各地目前正大力抢运防汛器材，继续加固险工堤段和水库塘坝。湖区各县都按照水流和堤坝系统，划分了防守范围，各公社以生产大队为单位组织了精悍的防汛队伍。山区、丘陵区除建立防洪组织外，对每个水库、塘、坝都固定了一个观测员，负责掌握水情。浏阳县检查出境内有四个水库还没有开溢洪道，立即组织人力突击挖好；并且采取整理溢洪道、开辟水沟、建谷坊等办法，使蓄水面大的水库分化主流，改急水为缓水，以减少山洪对水库的压力，确保安全。
    湖南省从4、5月以来，由于雨量过多，有些江河的水位就曾经超过了警戒线。为了战胜水害保丰收，各地在党的领导下积极展开了防汛斗争。常德县各公社社员提出“分秒必争，蔸禾必保，连下三百毫米暴雨无渍灾”的口号，集中排水机械抢排了垸内积水。湘阴县临湖的各公社，已完成了防浪准备工作。
    新华社兰州12日电　甘肃省集中力量在汛前突击建成一批重点水库工程，力争提早发挥工程效益，增加抗旱防涝能力，扩大夏秋田灌溉面积。
    甘肃省今年开工的水库多，容量大，计划完成的库容量等于原有库容量的四倍。目前，夏汛行将到来。各地对正在施工的库容量在一百万立方米以上的水库，都按照每座水库的工程进度，工程量、劳力、时间、工效、器材供应、水文等情况进行了摸底排队，重新安排了劳动力，把目前已经完成和可以暂缓修建的渠、井、水库工程都暂停下来，抽出人力支援重点工程。力争在洪汛到来之前突击建成，或将大坝修到拦洪标准，以增加夏秋作物抗旱防涝能力。
    为了保证重点工程如期完成，所有工程都实行了书记包库，分级负责的办法。省委决定库容量在百万立方米以上，千万立方米以下的水库，由县委负责；千万立方米以上，一亿立方米以下的由地、州委负责；一亿立方米以上由地委和省委共同负责。天水专区实行书记包库后，大大促进了工程进度。全省工业、交通、财贸、文教等部门，也都为加速水库修建贡献力量。兰州市城市建设第三工程局，平凉市商业局等部门，积极清仓翻库，清理出各种水库工地用具一万多件，送往工地。（附图片）
