Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 21st: Indonesian Communist Party Chairman D.N. Aidit pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's brazen announcement of the "natural enactment" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a disregard for the interests and dignity of the Japanese people and an arbitrary act taken entirely for the benefit of the United States, which should be condemned.

Aidit made these remarks in an interview with a reporter from the Indonesian "People's Daily." He also said that Kishi Nobusuke's arbitrary behavior is reminiscent of the rampant actions of Japanese militarism during World War II, which cruelly ignited the flames of war in Asia. Kishi Nobusuke, like the Japanese militarists during World War II, is bound to be defeated.

Aidit pointed out that Eisenhower's forced cancellation of his trip to Japan was a victory for the Japanese people and Asian peace. He said that it was the first time in American history that a U.S. president had been declared persona non grata by the people of another country, thus becoming a ridiculous old clown.

Aidit said that the Indonesian people must continue to support the Japanese people. This is not only because the demands of the Japanese people are justified, but also because these demands involve the interests of the Asian people, including the Indonesian people. He said that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" not only endangers the Japanese people, but also endangers the people of all of Asia and the world. The collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet would be a good thing for the Japanese people and the Asian people, including the Indonesian people. He said that Kishi Nobusuke was notorious for the crimes he committed as a cabinet member of the Tojo cabinet, which launched the "Greater East Asia War" and caused the sacrifice of four million Indonesians.

Aidit pointed out that the imperialism opposed by the Japanese people is the same imperialism that the Indonesian people are fighting against—U.S. imperialism, which is the most ferocious enemy of mankind. It allows the Dutch armed forces occupying West Irian and attempting to attack other areas of the Republic of Indonesia to use American weapons.

Aidit paid the highest respect to the Japanese people who stand at the forefront of the struggle against the most ferocious U.S. imperialism, and extended the warmest greetings and best wishes to the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

    印度尼西亚共产党主席
    艾地支持日本人民正义斗争
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地指出，岸信介政府悍然宣布新日美“安全条约”的“自然成立”这种做法，是漠视日本人民的利益和尊严，并完全是为了美国的利益而采取的武断行为，这种行为应该受到谴责。
    艾地是在向印度尼西亚“人民日报”的记者发表谈话时这样说的。他还说，岸信介的这种武断行为使人想起日本军国主义在第二次世界大战中残酷地在亚洲燃起战火的猖狂行为。岸信介像第二次世界大战期间的日本军国主义者一样，肯定是要被击败的。
    艾地指出，艾森豪威尔被迫取消他的日本之行，是日本人民和亚洲和平的胜利。他说，美国总统被其他国家的人民宣布为不受欢迎的人，从而成为一个可笑的老丑角，这在美国历史上还是第一次。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚人民必须继续支持日本人民。这不仅是由于日本人民的要求是正当的，而且还由于，这些要求涉及包括印度尼西亚人民在内的亚洲人民的利益。他说，修改日美“安全条约”，不仅危及日本人民，而且也危及整个亚洲和全世界的人民。岸信介内阁垮台，对日本人民和包括印度尼西亚人民在内的亚洲人民来说，都将是好事情。他说，岸信介在担任东条内阁阁员时就由于犯下了罪行而臭名昭著，东条内阁发动了“大东亚战争”，使四百万印度尼西亚人牺牲。
    艾地指出，日本人民反对的帝国主义就是印度尼西亚人民跟它斗争的帝国主义——美帝国主义，它是人类最凶恶的敌人。它让占据西伊里安和企图袭击印度尼西亚共和国其他地区的荷兰武装部队使用了美国武器。
    艾地向站在反对最凶恶的美帝国主义的斗争前列的日本人民致崇高的敬礼，并向日本共产党和社会党表示最热烈的问候和最美好的愿望。
