    新华社布拉格9日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克逮捕了三个美国特务。他们是在潜入国境后不久就被逮捕的。
    这三个美国间谍叫瓦夫拉、穆利德兰和斯拉维克。
    瓦夫拉曾在一名美国老间谍的监督下，在设在西德的贝许斯加登、慕尼黑的美国谍报总部中接受了特别训练。后来，他就被转移到西柏林，接受了进行间谍活动的指示。
    穆利德兰也是在贝许斯加登情报总部中接受间谍训练的。他的任务是为北大西洋侵略集团在斯洛伐克搜集军事和经济情报。
    斯拉维克是美国间谍机关的老特务，他在纽伦堡接受了长期的情报训练。他到捷克斯洛伐克来的目的是建立间谍网，同其他的美国间谍建立联系，并且只在战争爆发的时候进行活动。
