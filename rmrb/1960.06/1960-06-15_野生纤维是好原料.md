    Wild Fibers Are a Good Raw Material
    Sun Kuifeng, female worker in the No. 2 Fine Yarn Workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory
    I have been working as a doffer for over eighteen years. In April of this year, I started tending the fine spinning machines that spin wild fibers. Now it seems like spinning this kind of yarn is nothing special, one person can tend one machine (800 spindles).
    But in the beginning, the yarn kept breaking. Walking and sitting, I pondered, splicing the yarn while studying the problem. Later I thought it must be that the traveler was too light, and the yarn strand couldn't be pressed down, a problem of the force not being evenly distributed. I tried adding another traveler. It really worked, and this time it didn't break. So I spliced the yarn and installed travelers, and when this side of the machine was fully equipped, it ran smoothly, without a single break on all four hundred spindles. I told the foreman about this experiment, and it was fully implemented that day. Since then, one person tending one machine is not busy at all. Currently, we are mixing in 30% wild fibers. At this rate, spinning yarn with pure wild fibers will not be a problem. If we can find a way to improve the machine further, high-count yarns can also be spun.
    The Party Secretary said it well: as long as we always listen to the Party, constantly use our brains, and everyone comes up with ideas, no matter how many difficulties there are, we can overcome them. We must not only use wild fibers to spin yarn and weave ordinary cloth, but also spin high-count yarns and weave high-grade cloth.

### 野生纤维是好原料

    野生纤维是好原料
    金州纺织厂二细纱车间女工　孙魁凤
    我做落纱工作已经十八年多了。今年4月份，我开始看纺野生纤维的细纱机。现在看来纺这种纱倒没什么，一个人可以看一台机（八百锭）。
    可是刚开始的时候，纱条一个劲儿地断头。走着、坐着琢磨，我一面接头，一面研究。后来我想，一定是钢丝圈轻了，纱条压不下去，劲缓不开的毛病。我就试着又增加了一个钢丝圈。也真灵，这回不断头了。我就一面接头，一面安钢丝圈，等把这面车子都安齐了，开得刷刷地，四百个锭一个不断。我把这个试验告诉了工长，当天就全面推广了。打那以后，一个人看一台机一点不忙。现在是混用野生纤维30％，照这样，纯用野生纤维纺纱也没问题。如果再想法改进改进机器，高支纱也能纺出来。
    党委书记说得好：只要我们时刻听党的话，不断地开动脑筋，大家都来想办法，困难再多也能克服。我们不仅要用野生纤维纺出纱，织出一般的布，而且要纺高支纱，织高级布。
