Without Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty, the Souls of Martyrs Cannot Rest in Peace
Tokyo: 5,000 Mourn Michiko Kamba

Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, Tokyo News: Five thousand Japanese students, filled with grief and indignation, held a memorial service today for Michiko Kamba, the female student murdered by the Nobusuke Kishi government on June 15th.

About three thousand students packed the Hibiya Public Hall, the venue for the memorial service.

Outside the public hall, another two thousand people participated in the memorial service.

At the altar, those who paid their respects to Michiko Kamba's portrait included Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Akira Kazami, representative of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," Ikutaro Shimizu, professor at Gakushuin University, and female poet Sumako Fukao.

Michiko Kamba's parents expressed their gratitude to those who organized and participated in the memorial service for their daughter. They said that only after the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" is abolished can the soul of their beloved daughter rest in peace in the netherworld.

The memorial service ended with attendees offering flowers to the altar and singing The Internationale in unison.

After the memorial service, five thousand attendees solemnly proceeded to the West Gate of the Diet, the site of her murder. Those at the front of the procession carried Michiko Kamba's portrait. They offered flowers and observed a moment of silence at the altar set up there.

The students then held protest demonstrations at Nobusuke Kishi's Prime Minister's Office and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.
