    The Struggle of the People of Hokkaido
    By Hidetaka Shinkawa, Standing Director of the "Hokkaido Citizens' Conference for Crushing the Japan-U.S. 'Security System'"

    Hokkaido is one of Japan's four major islands, with a population of over 5.6 million. Since the defeat of Japanese imperialism in 1945, the people of Hokkaido have actively fought for independence, peace, and democracy. After the war, democratic forces held the position of Governor of Hokkaido for twelve years.

    In 1958, while plotting to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Nobusuke Kishi also conspired to revive the military police state by revising the "Police Duties Law" to adapt to the so-called new Japan-U.S. "security system." In order to crush this conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke group, the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, various democratic and peace organizations, as well as figures from the legal and cultural circles, formed a huge united front to struggle and achieved great victories. The people of Hokkaido also organized joint struggle organizations in this struggle, and all democratic groups joined the ranks of the battle. The working class of Hokkaido showed great enthusiasm and courage in the struggle. At that time, Nobusuke Kishi repeatedly threatened to punish union members who participated in the struggle in the form of strikes. However, the National Railway Workers' Union, which stood at the forefront of this struggle, held a strike despite this threat. A national railway worker in Hokkaido said: "If I am punished, and it is written in red ink on my resume, I will proudly show this resume to my children and grandchildren so that they know that I once fought to defend the rights of the people." These words, famous throughout the country, showed the heroic spirit of the Japanese working class.

    The struggle against the "Police Duties Law" was actually the prelude to the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Following the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law," the people of Hokkaido, together with the people of the whole country, launched a struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." During the local elections in April 1959, the people of Hokkaido took the lead in forming the "Hokkaido Citizens' Conference for Crushing the Japan-U.S. 'Security System'." Forty-three organizations, including the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Peace Committee, the Hokkaido Trade Union Council, the Farmers' League, and the Fishermen's League, joined this organization.

    After the formation of the "Citizens' Conference," it combined the strength of the trade unions and launched propaganda activities throughout Hokkaido aimed at organizing joint struggle organizations in towns and villages. By October, major towns and villages throughout Hokkaido had formed regional joint struggle conferences and completed the work of raising funds for activities. After this, each city and town further formed grassroots regional joint struggle conferences based on the school districts of elementary school students.

    From mid-October to November 6, the "Citizens' Conference" organized a "Grand Parade to Eliminate Unemployment, Defend the Right to Life, and Oppose the 'Security Treaty'" with the participation of 30,000 people. Mass rallies were held in all the towns and villages through which the parade passed, with a total of 780,000 people participating in the rallies. This grand parade exposed the essence of the "Security Treaty" to the masses.

    Recently, the news of the grand rallies held in various parts of China to support the struggle of the Japanese people has quickly caused a huge reaction in Hokkaido. In particular, the telegram from the Harbin mass rally on May 14 to the "Hokkaido Citizens' Conference for Crushing the Japan-U.S. 'Security System'" greatly encouraged the morale of the people of Hokkaido and strengthened the unity between the people of Japan and China. The strong support of the Chinese people made the Japanese people deeply feel that "our struggle is by no means isolated!"

    The struggle goal of the joint struggle organizations in Hokkaido is to crush the Japan-U.S. "Security System," that is, "never provide military bases to the United States" and "Yankees get out of Japan!"

    Our struggle is only just beginning. The people of Hokkaido, who have always stood at the forefront of the Japanese democratic front, are determined to carry out a long-term struggle to achieve this goal.

    北海道人民的斗争
    “北海道粉碎日美‘安全体制’道民会议”常任干事  新川辉隆
    北海道是日本四大岛之一，人口五百六十多万。从1945年日本帝国主义战败后以来，北海道人民一直积极地为争取独立、和平、民主而斗争。战后，民主力量掌握北海道道知事的职位达十二年之久。
    1958年，岸信介在策划修改日美“安全条约”同时，阴谋通过修改“警职法”复活军事警察国家，以适应所谓新的日美“安全保障体制”。为了粉碎岸信介集团的这一阴谋，日本社会党、共产党、各民主和平团体以及法学界、文化界人士组成了一个巨大的统一战线进行斗争，并且取得了巨大的胜利。北海道人民在这一斗争中也组织了共同斗争组织，所有的民主团体都加入了战斗的行列。北海道的工人阶级在斗争中表现得十分积极、英勇。当时，岸信介一再威胁说，要处分以罢工形式参加斗争的工会会员。但是，站在这个斗争前列的国营铁道工会，不顾这种威胁而举行了罢工。北海道的一个国营铁道工人说：“如果给我处分，用红笔写在我的履历书上，我将要自豪地把这份履历书给我的儿孙们看，让他们知道我曾经为保卫人民的权利而进行了斗争。”这句驰名全国的话，显示了日本工人阶级的英勇气概。
    反对“警职法”的斗争，实际上就是反对“安全条约”斗争的前哨战。继反对修改“警职法”斗争后，北海道人民和全国人民一起，掀起了反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。1959年4月份举行地方选举期间，北海道人民率先组成了“北海道粉碎日美‘安全体制’道民会议”。加入这个组织的有日本社会党、共产党、和平委员会、全道工会协议会、农民同盟、渔民同盟等四十三个团体。
    “道民会议”组成后，就结合工会的实力行动，在全道各地展开了以组织镇村共同斗争组织为目标的宣传活动。到10月份，全北海道的主要镇村都组成了地区共同斗争会议，并且完成了筹集活动资金的工作。在这以后，各市镇更进一步以小学生的走读区为单位，组成基层的地区共同斗争会议。
    从10月中旬到11月6日，“道民会议”组织了有三万人参加的“消灭失业、保卫生活权利、反对‘安全条约’大游行”。所有游行队伍经过的镇村都举行群众集会，参加集会的人数共计七十八万人。这次大游行向广大群众揭露了“安全条约”的本质。
    最近中国各地召开的支持日本人民斗争的盛大集会消息，很快在北海道引起了巨大的反响。特别是5月14日哈尔滨市群众大会给“北海道粉碎日美‘安全体制’道民会议”的通电，大大地鼓舞了北海道人民的斗志，并加强了日中两国人民的团结。中国人民的强有力支持，使日本人民深切地感到“我们的斗争决不是孤立的！”
    北海道的共同斗争组织的斗争目标，是要粉碎日美“安全体制”，也就是“决不给美国提供军事基地”、“美国佬从日本滚出去！”
    我们的斗争还不过是刚刚开始。一向站在日本民主战线斗争前列的北海道人民，决心为实现这个目标进行长期的斗争。
