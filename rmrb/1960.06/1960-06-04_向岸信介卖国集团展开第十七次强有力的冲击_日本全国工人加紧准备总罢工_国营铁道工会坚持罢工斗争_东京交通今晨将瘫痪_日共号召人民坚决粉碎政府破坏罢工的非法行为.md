Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd— News: All sectors in Japan are intensifying preparations for the victory of the historic June 4th general strike.

Five thousand workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held rallies in various parts of Tokyo this afternoon to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Following this, the workers went to various stations to encourage and support the strike of the National Railway ("Kokutetsu") workers. They will guard the stations overnight to prevent sabotage by fascists and the police authorities; tomorrow morning, the workers will hold a rally with passengers to oppose the new "Security Treaty" and demand the dissolution of the Diet.

Two thousand Japanese students held a demonstration in front of the Diet this afternoon to support the June 4th general strike.

The main force of the general strike, the "Kokutetsu" Workers' Union, is filled with an active atmosphere at every post. The union offices are filled with red flags, and encouraging letters from various groups are pouring in like snowflakes.

At Tokyo Station, many passenger cars yesterday had leaflets pasted on them, reading: Demand the Kishi Cabinet resign en masse! Dissolve the Diet! Railway workers are carrying out various deployments in accordance with the strike plans of the "Kokutetsu" Workers' Union and the Motive Power Workers' Union, so that they will stop running from the first train in the early morning of the 4th until 7:00 a.m.

In the past few days, people have been distributing leaflets in front of every tram station in Tokyo from early morning. At the same time, loudspeakers constantly broadcast calls for pedestrians and residents to support the June 4th general strike and participate in the 17th National Unified Action. Those participating in these publicity and mobilization efforts include workers, students, youth, elderly women, and famous university professors.

The owners of approximately eight thousand stores have jointly decided that they will not deduct wages from employees participating in the general strike. The Kishi Shinsuke government is preparing to dispatch railway police to suppress the general strike. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is also preparing to mobilize 12,000 police officers, directly commanded by the Superintendent-General, to begin "alerting" from the afternoon of the 3rd. The authorities also began abducting some drivers from the evening of the 2nd, plotting to force them to drive trains on the morning of the 4th.

The "Kokutetsu" Workers' Union issued a statement on the evening of the 2nd, strongly condemning the authorities' despicable behavior of plotting to sabotage the strike, and stated that the union will not succumb to any pressure, but will unite with people from all walks of life to severely protest the Kishi Shinsuke group's act of forcibly passing the new "Security Treaty" that endangers the interests of the Japanese nation through a strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd— News: On the eve of the Japanese workers' general strike on June 4th, more than 500 train drivers of the National Railway have gathered at designated locations in accordance with the instructions of the union, and are ready for the general strike that will begin tomorrow morning. The purpose of this general strike is to demand the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the dissolution of the Diet, and the resignation of the Kishi Cabinet.

At important stations in Tokyo such as Kamata, Shinagawa, Ikebukuro, and Shimo-jujo, a large number of railway workers have gathered to stand guard at the stations to prevent police attacks.

At the same time, near the main railway stations in Tokyo, students, women, artists, stage actors, university professors, and members of peace organizations are distributing leaflets to passengers, urging them to support the June 4th strike. Their publicity efforts will continue until late at night.

Tokyo's traffic will be paralyzed on the morning of June 4th. By 7:00 a.m. on the 4th, the operations of the National Railway, trams, and buses will be stopped.

The government issued a "warning"-style statement on the 2nd, threatening the workers who were going to strike. However, the "warning" had almost no effect on the workers.

This afternoon, Shinji Sogō, the president of the Japanese National Railways, summoned the leaders of the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Locomotive Workers' Union, and strongly demanded that the planned strike be canceled. Union leaders flatly rejected this request.

The Tokyo Transportation Workers' Union decided today to stop trams and buses on the morning of the 4th until 7:00 a.m.

The main force of the strike on the morning of the 4th, the Tokyo National Railway workers, began preparing for the strike this morning. The Kishi Shinsuke government dispatched approximately 4,000 railway police to the main railway stations to kidnap train drivers, attempting to force them to work on the 4th. However, the authorities did not kidnap enough drivers to keep the trains running.

The suppression by the Japanese police cannot scare the organized workers. At Shinagawa Station, Iguchi Sumio, a member of the strike committee of the union, was attacked by railway police this morning. But it could not prevent him from persisting in his will to strike. At Tsudanuma Station in Chiba Prefecture, union workers bravely resisted the attack when police attempted to kidnap train drivers. At stations in Chiba Prefecture and East Kanagawa Prefecture, similar struggles occurred between workers and police dispatched by the Kishi Shinsuke government to suppress them. Yoshida Chuzaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, told reporters tonight that all railway workers have been mobilized to prepare for the start of the strike. He said, "I firmly believe that the workers of our union will hold an orderly strike tomorrow as planned."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd— News: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today protesting the "warning" issued by the Kishi Shinsuke government to workers regarding the June 4th general strike against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Kishi Shinsuke government issued a "warning" to workers yesterday, attempting to sabotage this general strike.

The statement said that when the Kishi Shinsuke group colludes with the American imperialists to push Japan into a serious crisis, the Japanese workers must fight bravely. Workers are taking strike action for the just cause of building a democratic, peaceful and independent Japan.

The statement said that all Japanese people must now resolutely support the striking workers, thereby defending the great cause they are engaged in.

The statement pointed out that the right of workers to take protest actions on political and economic issues is an inalienable right guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution.

The statement revealed that the Kishi Shinsuke group is plotting to exploit the temporary chaos that will inevitably result from the strike action to incite some people against the striking workers, and to profit from it in order to prolong his political life. The statement called on the Japanese people to crush this conspiracy.

The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party resolutely protests the Kishi Shinsuke government's malicious "warning" against the general strike and guarantees to stand at the forefront in the patriotic and just struggle on June 4th.

    向岸信介卖国集团展开第十七次强有力的冲击
    日本全国工人加紧准备总罢工
    国营铁道工会坚持罢工斗争　东京交通今晨将瘫痪
    日共号召人民坚决粉碎政府破坏罢工的非法行为
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本各界正在为有历史意义的6月4日总罢工的胜利展开，加紧进行准备。
    属于日本工会总评议会的五万名工人今天下午分别在东京各地举行集会，反对日美军事同盟条约。接着，工人们到各个车站去鼓励和支援国营铁道（“国铁”）工人的罢工。他们今晚将通宵守卫在各个车站，以防备法西斯分子和警察当局的破坏活动；明天清早，工人们将同乘客一起举行反对新“安全条约”、要求解散国会的大会。
    两万名日本学生今天下午在国会前面举行示威游行，支援六·四总罢工。
    总罢工的主力“国铁”工会的各个岗位，充满了活跃的气氛。工会办公室里挂满了红旗，各界团体的鼓舞信像雪花似地飞来。
    在东京车站，昨天有许多客车车身上贴着传单，上面写着：要求岸内阁全体辞职！解散国会！铁路工人正在按照“国铁”工会和动力车工会的罢工计划进行各项部署，以便从4日清晨第一班车起停驶一直到上午七时。
    这几天，东京每一个电车车站前面从清早起就有人在散发传单。同时播音器里不断传出号召行人和居民支持六·四总罢工和参加第十七次全国统一行动的呼声。参加这些宣传鼓动工作的有工人、学生、青年、年迈的妇女和著名的大学教授。
    约有八千家商店的业主已经联合作出决定，他们对参加总罢工的职工不扣薪水。岸信介政府准备出动铁道警察镇压总罢工。东京警视厅另外准备动员一万二千名警察，由警视总监直接指挥，从3日下午起开始“警戒”。当局并且从2日晚上开始掳走一部分司机，阴谋强迫他们在4日早晨开火车。
    “国铁”工会在2日晚上发表声明，强烈谴责当局阴谋破坏罢工的卑鄙行为，并且表示工会将不屈服于任何压力，同各阶层人民团结起来，通过罢工严重抗议岸信介集团强行通过危害日本民族利益的新“安全条约”的行为。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：在日本工人6月4日举行总罢工的前夜，国营铁道的五百多名火车司机已经遵照工会的指示在指定地点集合，为明天早上开始的总罢工作好了准备。这次总罢工的目的是要求废除新日美“安全条约”、解散国会和岸内阁总辞职。
    东京的蒲田、品川、池袋和下十条等重要车站，大批的铁道工人已经聚集起来在车站上放哨，防备警察的袭击。
    同时，在东京的各主要火车站附近，学生、妇女、艺术家、舞台演员、大学教授以及和平组织的成员，正在向旅客们散发传单，敦促他们支持6月4日的罢工。他们的宣传工作将一直继续到深夜。
    6月4日上午东京的交通将陷于瘫痪。到4日上午七点钟，国营铁道、电车和公共汽车的业务都将停顿。
    政府2日发表了一项“警告”式的声明，威胁将要罢工的工人。可是，“警告”对工人差不多没有发生任何作用。
    今天下午，日本国营铁道总裁十河信二召集了国营铁道工会和国营机车工会的领导人，强烈要求取消预定的罢工。工会领袖们断然拒绝这种要求。
    东京交通工会今天决定，在4日上午停止电车和公共汽车，直到七点钟为止。
    4日上午罢工的主力东京国营铁道工人今天上午开始作罢工的准备。岸信介政府派遣了大约四千名铁道警察到主要的火车站上去绑架火车司机，企图强迫他们在4日上工。但是当局并没有绑到可以使火车开行的足够数量的司机。
    日本警察的镇压吓不倒已经组织起来的工人。在品川车站，工会罢工委员会委员井口澄雄今天上午遭到了铁路警察的袭击。但是并不能阻止他坚持罢工的意志。在千叶县的津田沼车站，当警察企图绑架火车司机的时候，工会工人勇敢地抵抗他们的袭击。在千叶县和东神奈川县的车站，工人同岸信介政府派去镇压的警察发生了类似的斗争。国营铁道工会中央执行委员会主席吉田忠三郎今晚向新闻记者发表谈话说，所有铁路工人已经被动员起来准备开始罢工。他说，“我深信，我们工会的工人将按预定计划在明天举行有秩序的罢工”。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天发表声明，抗议岸信介政府就反对日美新“安全条约”的6月4日总罢工向工人发出的“警告”。
  岸信介政府昨天曾经对工人发出“警告”，企图破坏这次总罢工。
    声明说，当岸信介集团同美帝国主义者勾结在一起把日本推进严重危机的时候，日本工人要奋勇斗争。工人采取罢工行动是为了建立一个民主、和平和独立的日本的正义事业。
    声明说，日本全体人民现在必须坚决支持罢工的工人，从而保卫他们从事的伟大事业。
    声明指出，工人就政治和经济问题采取抗议行动，是由日本宪法保障的不可剥夺的权利。
    声明揭露：岸信介集团正在阴谋利用罢工行动会不可避免地造成的暂时的混乱来煽动一些人反对罢工工人，从中渔利，以便延长他的政治生命。声明号召日本人民粉碎这种阴谋。
    声明说，日本共产党坚决抗议岸信介政府对总罢工的恶毒的“警告”，并保证在6月4日的爱国正义斗争中站在最前列。
