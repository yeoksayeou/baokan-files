Guangdong canteens grow vegetables, raise pigs, and develop non-staple food processing production
Hebei canteens establish vegetable bases to improve food quality
Guizhou's Nayong County canteens have a rich foundation, commune members say it's like a big tree taking root.

(Reported by our newspaper) Rural canteens in Guangdong are actively developing canteen-based production, growing large quantities of vegetables, raising pigs, fish, and poultry, further improving the lives of commune members and promoting production.

According to incomplete statistics from Zhanjiang, Shantou, Foshan, and other special districts, more than 470,000 mu of various melons and vegetables have been planted, more than 300,000 pigs are being raised, and more than 960,000 poultry are being raised. In Lechang County, more than 1,400 of the 1,700 canteens have achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency in non-staple foods. Various places have also planted large quantities of oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, and sunflowers. Jiangkou Commune in Qingyuan County used barren land to plant 1,800 mu of sesame, rapeseed, and peanuts, averaging more than six mu per canteen. Canteens in various places have also established thousands of non-staple food processing plants, processing large quantities of starch, pickling salted vegetables, pickled cabbage, and preserved vegetables, and making tofu, soy sauce, chili sauce, etc. Yongkou Canteen in Shilong Commune, Dongguan County, now has enough pickled mustard greens, preserved radish, and pickled cabbage to feed all commune members for three months. Canteens in river network areas also organize fishing teams to catch fish and shrimp. Dongcun Canteen in Xingtan Commune, Shunde County, recently caught more than 30,000 jin of fish and shrimp in one month, greatly improving the lives of commune members.

The development of canteen-based production not only ensures that commune members eat their fill and eat well, but also provides a certain amount of commodities to the market.

Party committees at all levels in Guangdong have always attached importance to the development of canteen production. At the beginning of this year, the Provincial Party Committee called on all rural canteens in the province to strive for self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and oil within a short period of time, and Party committees at all levels also assigned special personnel to strengthen leadership over this work. Therefore, a great upsurge in developing canteen-based production quickly swept the province. Various places generally adopted a combination of mass-based shock tactics and specialized teams, using spare time to plant vegetables, oil crops, and feed crops, and assigning special personnel to manage them after planting, thereby solving the contradiction of insufficient labor. In order to avoid occupying the production team's cultivated land, Zhanjiang and Shaoguan special districts, which have more barren land, reclaimed wasteland to expand the planting of vegetables and oil crops. Shantou, Foshan, and other special districts with less barren land used areas in front of and behind houses and alongside roads and ditches for planting. For example, Sanjiang Commune in Xinhui County has an average of only two li of vegetable land per person, but they adopted the cultivation methods of intercropping tall and short plants, intercropping long-term and short-term crops, and "five generations under one roof," greatly increasing the harvest of vegetables. In addition to ensuring that each person has two or three jin of vegetables to eat every day, the commune's canteens can also supply more than 200,000 jin to the market every month. When developing vegetable production, canteens in various places paid special attention to planned planting, diverse varieties, evergreen in all seasons, and year-round supply.

(Reported by our newspaper) In the vigorous production movement to combat drought and harvest and plant summer crops, Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province have focused on running public canteens well, paying close attention to the masses' lives, and promoting an all-round upsurge in the province's work of combating drought, protecting seedlings, harvesting summer crops, and planting summer crops.

Hebei Province has not had a thorough rain for more than 200 days from October of last year to now. Under such drought conditions, the broad masses of commune members, with tenacious heroic spirit, have vigorously dug underground water sources and made full use of all water sources, deeply carrying out the struggle against drought and achieving remarkable results. At present, the province's daily watering progress has increased from one million mu in early May to more than 1.7 million mu. At present, the broad masses of the people in the province are rushing to combat drought and protect seedlings on the one hand, and are throwing themselves into the battle of harvesting summer crops on the other, fighting to win an all-round bumper harvest.

During this period, Party organizations at all levels in various places have paid great attention to arranging the lives of the masses. In addition to paying attention to ensuring that the masses get appropriate rest and achieve a balance between work and rest, they have also paid close attention to the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of rural public canteens. Various places have generally adopted the methods of "politics entering the canteen" and "Party secretaries going down to the kitchen," starting with improving operation and management, grasping politics, production, and technology simultaneously, and consolidating and improving while rectifying. According to statistics from the four cities of Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, more than 30,000 Party secretaries and cadres at all levels have been invested in arranging people's lives and participating in canteen management, which quickly improved the management of the canteens. After these leading cadres went deep into the canteens, they not only ate, lived, and worked with the commune members, went deep into the masses to discover problems and solve problems, but also relied on the masses to mobilize the masses, cleaned up landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the canteens organizationally, established the superiority of poor and lower-middle peasants, and consolidated the socialist position of rural public canteens. A large number of Category III canteens in the province have risen to Category I canteens.

Vigorously developing canteen-based production is an important link in running canteens well. According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of spring, more than 130,000 canteens in the province have generally established vegetable bases, sowing a total of more than 1.5 million mu of vegetables. Many canteens have also built their own vinegar, sauce, soy sauce, and tofu processing plants, achieving self-sufficiency in non-staple foods.

Because Party committees at all levels care about the lives of the masses, commune members are full of energy. After rectifying the canteen, the labor attendance rate of Guozhuang Production Team in Guozhuang Commune, Gaocheng County, often remains above 95%.

(Reported by our newspaper) Rural canteens in Nayong County, Guizhou Province, vigorously develop canteen-based production, continuously improve the lives of commune members, and run the canteens better and better, becoming the best county in the province for running rural public canteens.

Nayong County is a border county where many ethnic groups live together. All the people in the county, except for a few with infectious diseases, have joined the canteens. All public canteens in the county grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, and process non-staple foods. Commune members said that having a family foundation for the canteen is like a big tree taking root, eternally green.

Over the past year, the canteen family foundation construction of the vast majority of canteens in Nayong County has developed from nothing to something, from small to large, and is becoming increasingly rich. Rural canteens in the county have planted more than 60,000 mu of vegetables, averaging more than two fen of land per person; raised more than 24,000 pigs and more than 130,000 chickens. Many canteens have realized "seven raisings" (pigs, chickens, ducks, fish, bees, rabbits, sheep) and planted a large number of fruit trees. When the Fake Canteen in Guokai Commune was first established, it had no family foundation. After more than a year of construction, this canteen of thirty-two Miao commune members now raises more than 100 pigs and more than 280 chickens; the canteen's thirty-two mu of vegetable land now not only provides enough fresh and tender green vegetables for the commune members every day, but also stores more than 1,000 jin of dried vegetables, and makes a variety of delicious pickles from radishes, garlic, and vegetable stalks.

With the establishment and continuous enrichment of the canteen family foundation, the food is diverse, and the diet of the commune members is getting better and better. With their own family foundation, the canteen can take care of the elderly, children, the sick, pregnant women, and women in confinement. Children can often eat candies and snacks processed by the canteen from wild plants. In addition to enjoying nutritious food in the canteen, every woman in confinement also receives a certain amount of brown sugar, glutinous rice, eggs, hens, and oil for free. Around the Spring Festival this year, public canteens also held weddings for 161 newly married couples.

Nayong County's vigorous development of canteen-based production has further consolidated the people's communes. More than 80% of the canteens in the county have changed the distribution system, transitioning from a grain supply system to a food supply system, increasing the communist elements of the commune. Secondly, because the canteen family foundation is constantly expanding and most of the daily life needs are solved, it is conducive to promoting the growth of commune members' collectivist thinking and increasing unity among commune members. Thirdly, the development of canteen-based production has also greatly promoted the development of breeding, vegetables, and non-staple food production. Finally, because the canteen provides full meals and fragrant dishes, commune members' enthusiasm for production is increasing. In the current high tide of rushing to harvest and plant, the labor attendance rate in the county has generally increased.

    广东食堂种菜养猪发展副食加工生产

    贵州纳雍县食堂有了丰厚家底，社员说像大树扎下粗根
    本报讯　广东各地农村食堂积极发展食堂家底生产，大量种菜、养猪、养鱼和饲养家禽，进一步改善了社员的生活，促进了生产。
    据湛江、汕头、佛山等专区不完全统计，目前已种下各类瓜菜四十七万多亩，养猪三十多万头，家禽九十六万多只。乐昌县一千七百多个食堂中，有一千四百多个食堂作到了副食品自给或半自给。各地还种下了大批花生、芝麻、向日葵等油料作物。清远县江口公社利用荒地种下芝麻、油菜、花生一千八百多亩，平均每个食堂有六亩多。各地食堂还开办了成千上万的副食品综合加工场，大量加工淀粉、腌制咸菜、酸菜、酱菜，制作豆腐、豉油、辣酱等。东莞县石龙公社涌口食堂现在腌制的大头菜、菜脯、酸菜，可供全体社员吃三个月。位于河网地区的食堂还专门组织捕鱼队伍捕捞鱼虾。顺德县杏坛公社东村食堂最近一月捕捞鱼虾三万多斤，大大改善了社员的生活。
    食堂家底生产的发展，不仅保证了社员吃饱吃好，而且还为市场提供一定数量的商品。
    广东省各级党委一直重视发展食堂生产。今年初，省委就号召全省农村食堂争取在短期内做到蔬菜、肉食、油料自给和半自给，各级党委也都指派专人加强对这项工作的领导。因此，全省迅速掀起了一个大搞食堂家底生产的热潮。各地普遍采用群众性的突击和专业组相结合的办法，利用业余时间种植蔬菜、油料作物和饲料作物，种下后由专人管理，从而解决了劳动力不足的矛盾。为了避免占用大队的耕地，荒地较多的湛江、韶关专区开荒扩种蔬菜、油料作物。荒地较少的汕头、佛山等专区，则利用屋前屋后，路边沟旁种植。如新会县三江公社平均每人只有二厘多菜地，但他们采取了高矮间种、长短套种、五代同堂的栽培方法，大大提高了蔬菜的收获量，除保证每人每天有二、三斤菜吃外，全社食堂每月还能供应市场二十多万斤。各地食堂在发展蔬菜生产时，都特别注意计划种植，品种多样，四季长青，常年供应。
    本报讯　中共河北省各级党组织在大力领导抗旱和夏收夏种的生产运动中，以办好公共食堂为主，大抓群众生活，促进了全省抗旱保苗和夏收夏种工作的全面高涨。
    河北省从去年10月到现在，已二百多天没有落过透雨。在这样干旱的情况下，全省广大社员以顽强的英雄气概，大挖地下水源和充分利用一切水源，深入开展抗旱斗争，并取得显著成就。目前全省浇水日进度已由5月上旬百万亩上升到一百七十多万亩。目前全省广大人民群众一面突击抗旱保苗，一面投入夏收战斗，为夺取全面大丰收而战斗。
    各地各级党组织，在这期间十分注意安排群众生活。除注意使群众得到适当休息，作到有劳有逸以外，并大抓农村公共食堂的整顿巩固提高工作。各地普遍采用了政治进食堂，书记下伙房方法，从改进经营管理入手，政治、生产、技术一齐抓，作到边整顿边巩固提高。据石家庄、唐山、天津、张家口等四个市的统计，目前投入安排人民生活、参加食堂管理的各级书记和干部达三万多人，很快改进了食堂的管理。这些领导干部深入食堂以后，不光同社员同吃、同住、同劳动，深入群众发现问题解决问题，还依靠群众发动群众，从组织上清洗了食堂中的地、富、反、坏分子，树立起贫农、下中农的优势，巩固农村公共食堂的社会主义阵地，全省三类食堂大量上升为一类食堂。
    大搞家底生产，是办好食堂的重要一环。据不完全统计，从入春以来，全省有十三万多个食堂普遍建起蔬菜基地，共播种蔬菜一百五十多万亩。许多食堂还自建起制醋、酱、酱油、豆腐加工厂，实现了副食品自给。
    由于各级党委关心群众生活，社员个个干劲十足。藁城县郭庄公社郭庄生产队，整顿食堂以后，社员劳动出勤率经常保持在95％以上。
    本报讯　贵州纳雍县农村食堂大搞家底生产，不断改善社员生活，把食堂办得愈来愈好，成为全省农村公共食堂办得最好的县。
    纳雍县是多民族杂居的边沿县。全县人民除个别患传染病者外，都参加了食堂。这个县所有公共食堂都种菜、喂猪、养鸡、加工副食品。社员们说，食堂有了家底，就像大树扎下粗根一样，万年长青。
    一年多来，纳雍县绝大多数食堂的家底建设，由无到有，由小到大，日益丰厚。全县农村食堂种菜六万多亩，平均每人合两分多地；养猪两万四千多头，养鸡十三万多只，有不少食堂实现了“七养”（猪、鸡、鸭、鱼、蜂、兔、羊），种植了大量果树。姑开公社法科食堂初办时什么家底也没有，经过一年多来的建设，这个三十二户苗族社员的食堂，现在养猪一百多头，养鸡二百八十多只；食堂的三十二亩蔬菜地现在除了每天供应社员足够的鲜嫩青菜，还储备干菜一千多斤，用萝卜、蒜头、菜秆等做出多种可口的泡菜。
    随着食堂家底的建立和不断丰厚，饭菜多样，社员的饮食愈来愈好，有了自己的家底，食堂对老人、小孩、病人、孕妇和产妇的照顾也就更加周到。孩子们经常可以吃到食堂用野生植物加工的糖和点心。每个产妇在食堂除了享受营养伙食，还免费得到一定数量的红糖、糯米、鸡蛋、母鸡、油脂等。今年春节前后，公共食堂还为一百六十一对新婚夫妇办了喜事。
    纳雍县大搞食堂家底生产，进一步巩固了人民公社。全县80％以上的食堂改变了分配制度，由粮食供给制过渡到伙食供给制，增长了公社的共产主义因素。其次，由于食堂家底不断扩大，日常生活需要大部分得到解决，这就有利于促使社员集体主义思想的成长，有利于增加社员间的团结。第三，食堂家底生产的发展，也大大促进了饲养、蔬菜和副食品生产的发展。最后，由于食堂饭饱菜香，社员生产积极性愈来愈高，在当前抢收抢种高潮中，全县劳动力出勤率普遍提高。
