Lament for compatriots, lament for compatriots, the time of death is approaching, the time of death is approaching. Foreigners' methods are cunning and cunning, slaughtering us without knives, destroying us without guns and cannons, secretly plotting cleverly. Severing our vitality and monitoring our minds, look at the dense American treaties that make people's souls tremble.

Lament for compatriots, lament for compatriots, the poison suffered is no small matter. Sailing across the ocean, the journey is long and obscure, vainly seeking a good livelihood, unexpectedly met with harsh abuse with no one to tell. Affecting scholars and merchants, their families and lives are difficult to protect, most pitiful are the old prisoners in wooden houses weeping in silence.

Lament for compatriots, lament for compatriots, everyone must not be restless. Arise, our four hundred million countrymen, and only through unity can we succeed. May we never be laughed at by white people, our hot blood surging like a tide. At the critical moment of life and death, fight for a second, unafraid of the fierce winds and high waves in the Atlantic Ocean.

    哀同胞歌
    陆荪畦
    哀同胞，哀同胞，死期将到了，死期将到了。外人手段狡复狡，屠我不用刀，灭我不用枪和炮，暗中布置巧。绝我生机监我脑，试看美约森森令人魂胆消。
    哀同胞，哀同胞，受毒原非小。航洋渡海程途杳，空求生计好，横来苛虐苦无告。波及士与商，身家性命都难保，最怜饮泣吞声木屋囚徒老。
    哀同胞，哀同胞，大家休要躁。振起国民四百兆，能得团体好。始终不被白人笑，热血涌如潮。生死关头争一秒，那怕大西洋里风急浪头高。
