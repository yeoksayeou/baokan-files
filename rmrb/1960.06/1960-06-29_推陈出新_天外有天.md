    Get Rid of the Stale and Bring Forth the Fresh
    Heaven Beyond Heaven
    The National Advanced Clothing Tailoring Experience Promotion Team recently conducted a five-day advanced tailoring technology performance in Nanjing. Now, the advanced experiences they brought have been rapidly promoted in Nanjing and have been well received by the masses.
    The characteristics of the advanced tailoring method are: tight layout, full use of cloth corners and edges, minimizing scrap, and not only not borrowing materials, but also using small materials to connect, which fully meets the quality regulations and technical requirements. It is suitable for both mass production and piecework.
    After learning this advanced tailoring method, the clothing industry workers in the city created 160 new varieties in five days. The Tianfu Processing Factory of the Qinhuai People's Commune originally required 1.4 zhang (1 zhang is about 3.3 meters) of cloth for a Zhongshan suit. After adopting the advanced tailoring method, it only requires 1.15 zhang, saving 0.25 zhang of cloth per suit; women's shirts originally required 0.36 zhang, now only 0.25 zhang. According to the factory's annual production of 36,000 pieces of clothing, 54,000 chi (1 chi is about 0.33 meters) of cotton cloth can be saved.

    全国服装剪裁先进经验推广队，最近在南京市进行了五天的先进裁剪技术表演，现在，他们带来的先进经验已在南京市迅速推广，受到群众的好评。
    先进剪裁方法的特点是：紧密排料，充分利用布角布边，使碎料减到最低限度，而且不仅不借料，小料接的也少，完全合乎质量规定和技术要求，既适合成批生产，也适用于零活。
    全市服装业职工学习了这种先进剪裁法后，五天中就创造了一百六十件新品种。秦淮人民公社天福加工厂，原来一套中山服要一丈四尺布料，采用先进剪裁法以后，只需一丈一尺五寸，每套节约用布二尺五寸；女式衬衣原需三尺六寸，现在只需二尺五寸。根据这个厂一年生产服装三万六千件计算，可节约棉布五万四千尺。
