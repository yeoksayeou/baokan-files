    Listen to the Party's Words, Raise the Red Flag Higher and Higher
    Representative of the Liuzhou People's Broadcasting Station, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Yang Luosheng
    Liuzhou Radio Station was established in January 1958, during the Great Leap Forward. At that time, the entire station had only ten people, over 90% of whom were novices. Every day, political programs had to be broadcast in Mandarin, Liuzhou dialect, and Cantonese. The technical equipment was also relatively rudimentary; broadcasting and amplification were in the same room; the reception room was the meeting room and also the dining room, as well as the recording studio; the machine room was also a dormitory; the 200-watt transmitter was modified from a 50-watt machine; the antenna was short, and the ground network was replaced with tap water pipes; there was not a single sheet of iron or a pound of enameled wire. It was under these conditions that the radio station overcame various difficulties and actively served the Great Leap Forward. Over the past two years, under the leadership and care of the Party, broadcasting propaganda has made certain achievements in serving politics and production.

      The Radio Station is a Powerful
          Propaganda Tool of the Party
    The radio station is a powerful propaganda tool of the Party. As soon as it was established, it immediately plunged into the Party's central tasks, actively carrying out propaganda and mobilization work, creating a strong East Wind, a hot atmosphere, and boosting morale, thereby powerfully promoting the smooth progress of various tasks. For example, during the nationwide steelmaking campaign in 1958, when the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee issued the order to the city's people to fight for steel on the radio, the radio station, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, promptly conducted continuous broadcasts ranging from one day and night to seven weeks during each battle, with the Party Committee arriving whenever called, and starting the machine in the middle of the night when summoned. It broadcast battle reports on time, promptly broadcast the Party's instructions, and vigorously publicized the new people and new things that emerged in steelmaking, so that the Party Committee could skillfully use the radio station as a tool. Subsequently, the Party Committee further demanded that the radio station "not only vigorously carry out propaganda and mobilization, but also do a good job of organization in the propaganda." According to the instructions of the Party Committee, we took the initiative to delve into the masses' production struggles to discover and cultivate typical examples, establish banners, and organize production competitions to learn from, catch up with, and surpass, thereby not only making the content of broadcast propaganda concrete and vivid, and well-received by the masses, but also directly promoting production to a great extent, demonstrating the powerful power of broadcast propaganda. For example, in the second battle to seize steel, the city's daily steel production target was 1,000 tons, and five factories, including Liuzhou Machinery Factory and Dongfeng Steel Plant, were responsible for half of the task. The Municipal Steel Command put forward the battle slogan of "Five Tiger Generals Breaking Through the 100-Ton Barrier." According to the instructions of the Party Committee, we focused on organizing two pathbreakers among the Five Tiger Generals—Liuzhou Machinery Factory and Dongfeng Steel Plant—to carry out a production contest between steel plants. When Dongfeng Steel Plant completed its steelmaking task two hours ahead of schedule, we immediately broadcast a recording of the good news to the city's steel warriors and carried out propaganda and mobilization to the Machinery Factory. Upon hearing the news, the Machinery Factory immediately convened an emergency meeting, calling on all factory workers to launch a surprise hard battle to catch up with "Dongfeng." As a result, more than fifty furnaces, both large and small, indigenous and foreign, were put into operation simultaneously in this factory. That night, they exceeded the output of Dongfeng Steel and overfulfilled the task, taking first place in the city. At the same time, under the driving force and influence of Dongfeng Plant and Machinery Plant, all steelmaking units also launched a high tide of competition to catch up with each other, thereby ensuring the smooth completion of the city's second battle task.

    This spring, during the city's Four Modernizations movement, the radio station broadcast a half-hour special program every day, reporting on the momentum and achievements of the movement, paving the way for the movement. In particular, it seized on the achievements and experiences of the Fans Factory and Paper Mill, two small factories, in vigorously carrying out innovation and realizing automated production lines, and publicized them extensively, attracting the attention of the city's people. After the movement was fully launched, we again focused on grasping typical examples and organizing competitions to promote the movement to advance wave upon wave. When we found that the Four Modernizations movement in the production materials station of the commercial system was progressing well, we organized them to send competition initiatives to brother units in the city. At the same time, we also reported to the Municipal Finance and Trade Department. The Finance and Trade Department immediately convened an on-site meeting in this station. In this way, a wave of technological innovation was immediately formed throughout the commercial system. Through competition, the non-staple food and sundry wholesale station created more than 60% more innovation projects in the second battle of the Four Modernizations movement than in the first battle, and the movements in other stations were also carried out vigorously.

    For advanced units, we also paid attention to promoting their advancement to become even more advanced, and raising the red flag higher and higher. On March 17 this year, a factory in Liuzhou completed the production plan assigned by the region for the first quarter ahead of schedule. In addition to running a congratulatory special program for them, the radio station also took the initiative to discuss with the factory's Party committee and decided to mobilize the workers to complete the plan assigned by the city for the first quarter ahead of schedule, and strive to run another report of good news special program to broadcast to the city. The factory's Party committee immediately convened a meeting of the branch secretaries of all workshops in the factory to discuss and study, and made arrangements. After hearing the news, the workers' enthusiasm doubled, and they immediately launched a five-day decisive battle, and finally completed the plan assigned by the city ahead of schedule on the 22nd. On the 24th, the factory workers heard the congratulatory broadcast held by the radio station for them, and were greatly encouraged. The workers in the third workshop carried out voluntary labor after work, and the office cadres also went to the workshop to support. In this way, the factory's daily output value on that day increased by more than 22% compared with the average daily output value since March. The factory's Party committee immediately wrote a letter of thanks to the radio station, saying: "You have added strength to us."

    In June and July 1959, reactionary factions and right-leaning opportunists at home and abroad launched a frenzied attack on the Party, slandered the Three Banners, and stirred up a cold wind. Some people in the city were affected by this cold wind and mistakenly believed that "we worked hard in 1958, and we should take a break this year," "the target has reached its peak," and "implementation means cutting the target," and so on. However, dark clouds cannot obscure the brilliance of the sun. The Party called on the masses to continue to hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and to advance courageously. The radio station, in the face of serious political struggle, stood firm and opened fire on right-leaning thoughts, resolutely defending the Three Red Banners. In response to the situation at the time, in addition to using the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 to systematically conduct positive propaganda and education for the workers, the radio station repeatedly broadcast the People's Daily's important editorials "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions, Strictly Practice Increasing Production and Practicing Economy" and "Oppose Right-Leaning, Boost Morale, and Strive to Complete the Main Targets of the Second Five-Year Plan This Year," and broadcasted fourteen articles such as "Make the Drums of the Great Leap Forward Beat Louder," "Difficulties Are Also Paper Tigers," and "Looking at Problems Should Look at the Essence," which criticized right-leaning views and speeches. When the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee listened to the radio station's broadcast of "Talking about Leaving Room" in response to "How to Correctly Understand the Idea of Leaving Room," he immediately called the radio station and said: "The article 'Talking about Leaving Room' is very good. The propaganda is timely. Immediately give it to the newspaper for reprinting." Liuzhou City also used this article as one of the study documents for cadres.

    The Radio Station Staff Must First
        Be Revolutionaries Themselves
    Few people, many things, and poor equipment are our actual difficulties. But we were not intimidated by the difficulties. The Party taught us: Those who engage in propaganda work are agitating others to make revolution, and they must first be revolutionaries themselves. In order to change the conditions of the radio station's few people, many things, and poor equipment, we did not rely on adding people and increasing equipment, but adopted the method of closely relying on the leadership of the Party and vigorously launching mass movements to strive to achieve the requirement of doing more and doing better with fewer people and poorer equipment. Over the past two years, the radio station has consistently adhered to carrying out versatile activities with one specialty and multiple skills. Now, all cadres in the station can record, 85% of the people can turn on the machine, manage the machine and relay broadcasts, and literary and artistic cadres can all broadcast. During the several battles of the steelmaking campaign in 1958, an average of 15,000 to 20,000 words of written drafts were broadcasted every day. The entire station, from leaders to reporters and broadcasters. The machine operators, in addition to being on duty, formed a frontline propaganda team, carrying microphones and tape recorders to the steelmaking furnace to collect and edit materials, conduct frontline on-site broadcast mobilization, and transmit them back to the radio station by telephone for broadcast to the city, ensuring that good news, victories, and experiences were quickly spread throughout the city. The station director and machine operators also participated in the broadcast. Because the subjective initiative of the cadres was fully发挥, the broadcasting formats of political programs increased to as many as 19 types, and the quality of the programs continued to improve.

    Vigorously implementing the policy of the whole Party running broadcasting and organizing a mass communication and reporting team is an inexhaustible source of稿件 and literary and artistic programs for the radio station. Due to the vigorous launching of mass movements,来稿 increased greatly, increasing by 50% in 1959 compared to 1958, and increasing by more than 50% in the first quarter of 1960 compared to the same period last year; for example, during the most intense stage of the steelmaking campaign in 1958, because the radio station implemented the policy of the whole Party running broadcasting, the situation reflected by the masses through telephones alone was more than 10,000 words per day.

    In 1959, 36 broadcasting conferences and 49 special broadcasts were held successively. In the first quarter of this year alone, 41 special programs and 42 special literary and artistic broadcasts were held. During the Four Modernizations movement, more than 30 units were organized to hold three consecutive literary and artistic broadcasting meetings. In the first quarter of this year, more than 5,000 minutes of literary and artistic programs were organized to cooperate with the center, most of which were written and performed by the workers themselves. In terms of the development of the cause, more than 1,300 wired loudspeakers were installed in the latter half of March, which is more than the cumulative number of development of broadcasting stations in the past three or four years.

    With poor equipment, we do not act as伸 手派, but take the road of self-reliance and arming ourselves. Through study and debate, the staff put politics in command, liberated their minds, broke down superstition, everyone contributed ideas, everyone contributed suggestions, and implemented the spirit of combining土 and 洋, from 土 to 洋, from small to large, and from simple to complex, and vigorously engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution. With the in-depth development of the mass movement of the technological revolution, the technical equipment of the radio station is constantly enriched and updated. For example, at the end of September 1959, under the circumstances that we had neither drawings nor a high level of technology, we designed ourselves and used the method of three combinations, worked hard for a month, and finally manufactured a 1,000-watt radio transmitter. In the Four Modernizations movement this spring, the radio station staff also focused on the key issues of improving work efficiency, and carried out more than 20 innovations and creations, reducing 28 processes to one, greatly improving work efficiency; making playback, recording, relaying, and startup automatic or semi-automatic, which not only saves manpower, but also ensures the accuracy of broadcasting time and the cooperation of various departments. This has played a great role in solving the difficulties of the radio station's few people, many things, poor equipment, and heavy tasks. Recently, we have also successfully trial-produced some more advanced products.

    Over the past two years, we have listened to the Party's words and achieved certain achievements in broadcast propaganda, career development, and technological innovation. We have been successively rated as an advanced unit in the city's socialist construction in 1959, an advanced unit in the city's Four Modernizations movement in the first quarter of 1960, an advanced unit in the city's cultural and educational heroes' meeting in 1959, a red flag unit in the region's cultural and educational heroes' meeting in 1959, an first-class outstanding collective reporter and first-class outstanding literary and artistic communication group of the Guangxi People's Broadcasting Station in 1959, and 45% of the radio station staff have been rated as various advanced workers or activists at the municipal level.

    听党的话，红旗越举越高
    广西僮族自治区柳州人民广播电台代表　杨洛生
    柳州电台是大跃进的1958年1月建立的。当时，全台仅有十个人，其中90％以上都是新手。每天要播出普通话、柳州话、广东话三种语言的政治节目。技术设备也比较简陋，播音、增音在一起；会客室是会议室又是饭厅，同时也是录音室；机房兼宿舍；二百瓦发射机是用五十瓦机改的；天线矮，地网是用自来水管代替；没有一张铁皮、一斤漆包线。电台就是在这样的条件下，克服各种困难，积极为大跃进服务的。两年多来，在党的领导和关怀下，广播宣传在为政治为生产服务方面作出了一定的成绩。
      电台是党的有力的
          宣传工具
    电台是党的有力的宣传工具，它一成立便立即投入党的各项中心工作中去，积极开展宣传鼓动工作，大刮东风、大造热气、大鼓干劲，从而有力地推动了各项工作的顺利开展。如1958年全民炼钢运动时，当市委第一书记在电台向全市人民发出为钢而战的号令后，电台根据市委指示，及时地在各个战役中都进行过一昼夜到七周夜的连续广播，党委随喊随到，半夜喊半夜开机。按时播送战报，及时播送党的指示，大力宣传炼钢中出现的新人新事，使党委能得心应手地运用电台这个工具。接着，党委又进一步对电台提出“不仅要大力做好宣传鼓动，还要在宣传中做好组织工作”。根据党委的指示，我们主动地深入到群众的生产斗争中去发现和培植典型，树立旗帜，组织学、赶、超的生产竞赛，从而不仅使广播宣传的内容具体、生动，为群众喜闻乐听，而且直接地对生产起了很大的推动作用，显示了广播宣传的强大威力。如在夺钢第二战役中，市的日产钢指标是一千吨，而柳州机械厂、东风钢厂等五个厂担负着一半任务，市钢铁指挥部提出了“五虎将大破百吨关”的战斗口号。我们根据党委指示，深入重点组织了五虎将中的两名闯将——柳州机械厂和东风钢厂，开展钢厂现场比武的生产对手竞赛。当东风钢厂提前两小时完成炼钢任务时，我们立即向全市钢铁战士播出了报喜录音，并向机械厂进行宣传鼓动。机械厂闻讯立刻召开紧急会议，号召全厂职工突击苦战赶“东风”。结果这个厂的大、小、土、洋五十多个炉子一齐上阵，当晚以超过东风钢产量的数量超额完成任务，取得了全市第一。同时在东风厂和机械厂的带动和影响下，所有炼钢单位也掀起了你追我赶的竞赛高潮，从而保证了全市第二战役任务的顺利完成。
    今春，在全市四化运动中，电台办了每天半小时的专题节目，报道运动的声势和成效，为运动鸣锣开道。特别抓住了粉丝厂、造纸厂两个小厂大闹革新，实现生产自动线的成绩和经验，大肆宣传，引起全市人民的注意。运动全面铺开后，我们又深入重点抓典型，组织竞赛，促使运动一浪高一浪地前进。当我们发现商业系统生产资料站四化运动开展得好，就组织他们向全市兄弟单位送竞赛倡议书，同时我们还向市委财贸部作了汇报。财贸部立即在这个站召开了现场会议，这样，使全商业系统的技术革新热潮立即形成。副食杂货批发站通过竞赛，在四化运动第二战役中创造的革新项目比第一战役增加了60％以上，其它各个站的运动也搞得轰轰烈烈。
    对于先进的单位，我们也注意促使其先进更先进，红旗越举越高。今年3月17日，柳州某厂提前完成了首季区下达的生产计划，电台除为他们办了祝捷专题之外，并主动和厂党委商量决定，发动职工再提前完成市下达的首季计划，争取再办一次报喜专题向全市广播。厂党委立即召开全厂各车间支部书记会议，讨论研究，并且作了部署。职工听到消息后，干劲倍增，立即开展五天决战，终于又在22日提前完成了市下达的计划。24日，该厂职工听到了电台为他们举办的祝捷广播，受到了更大鼓舞。三车间的职工，下班后，又进行了义务劳动，科室干部也到车间支援。这样，这个厂当天的日产值比3月份以来的平均日产值提高了22％以上。厂党委立即给电台写来感谢信，说：“你们给我们增添了力量”。
    1959年6、7月间，国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子，猖狂向党进攻，诬蔑三个万岁，刮了一股冷风。市内一部分人被这股冷风影响，错误地认为“1958年苦战了，今年要歇歇气”，“指标到顶了”，“落实就要砍指标”等等。但是，乌云遮掩不了太阳的光辉，党号召人民群众继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗奋勇前进，电台在严重的政治斗争面前，站稳脚跟向右倾思想开火，坚决保卫三面红旗。针对当时的情况，除用1958年大跃进的成绩系统地对职工进行正面宣传教育之外，还反复播送了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”、“反右倾、鼓干劲，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗”的重要社论，播出了“把大跃进的战鼓擂得更响”，“困难也是纸老虎”、“看问题要看本质”等批驳右倾观点、言论的文章十四篇。当市委第一书记听了电台针对“如何正确理解留有余地的思想”播出“谈留有余地”的文章以后，立即打电话给电台说：“谈留有余地这篇文章很好，宣传得正是时候，马上给报社转载”。柳州市还把这篇文章作为干部学习文件之一。
    电台工作人员自己首先
        要做革命派
    人少事多，设备差，这是我们的实际困难。但我们并没有被困难吓倒。党教导我们：搞宣传工作的人是鼓动别人革命的，自己首先要做革命派，为了改变电台人少事多设备差的条件，我们不靠加人增设备，而是采取了紧紧依靠党的领导和大搞群众运动的办法，努力达到人少设备差也要多办事、办好事的要求。两年来，电台一直坚持开展一专多能的多面手活动。现在全台干部已经人人会录音，85％的人会开机、值机转播，文艺干部都能播音。1958年炼钢运动的几次战役中，平均每天播出文字稿一万五千到两万字，全台从领导到记者、播音员。机务员，除值班外，组成火线宣传队，带话筒录音机到炼钢炉旁采编，进行火线现场广播鼓动，并用电话传回电台，向全市播出，保证捷报、喜讯、经验迅速传遍全市。台长、机务员也参加了广播。由于干部的主观能动性充分发挥，政治节目的播出形式增加到十九种之多，而且节目的质量不断提高。
    大力贯彻全党办广播的方针，组织群众通讯报道队伍，这是电台稿件和文艺节目取之不尽用之不竭的源泉。由于大搞群众运动，来稿大增，1959年比1958年增长50％，1960年第一季又比去年同期增长50％以上；如在1958年炼钢运动最紧张的阶段，由于电台贯彻了全党办广播的方针，每天单是群众通过电话反映的情况就在一万字以上。
    1959年先后举办了三十六次广播大会和四十九次专题广播，今年第一季就举办了四十一个特别节目和四十二个专题文艺广播。四化运动中，还组织三十多个单位连续举办了三次文艺广播会。今年第一季组织了五千多分钟配合中心的文艺节目，绝大部分都是职工群众自编自演的。在事业发展上3月下半月就安装了一千三百多只有线喇叭，比过去广播站三、四年的发展累计数还要多。
    设备差，我们不做伸手派，走自力更生，武装自己的道路。通过学习辩论，职工们政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信，人人献计，个个献策，贯彻土洋并举，由土到洋，由小到大，从简到繁的精神，大闹技术革新和技术革命。随着技术革命的群众运动的深入开展，电台的技术设备不断充实和更新。如在1959年9月底，我们在既无图纸，技术水平又不高的情况下，自己设计，用三结合的办法，苦战一个月，终于制造出一千瓦无线电发射机。在今年春天的四化运动中，电台职工又针对提高工作效率的关键问题，共搞了二十多项革新和创造，把二十八次工序减少到一次，大大提高了工作效率；使放音、录音、转播、开机实现自动化半自动化，不仅节约人力，还保证了播出时间的准确和各部门的协作。这对解决电台人少事多设备差而任务又重的困难来说，起了很大作用。最近还试制成功一些较高级的产品。
    两年来，我们听党的话，在广播宣传，事业发展，技术革新上取得了一定的成绩，先后被评为1959年市的社会主义建设先进单位，1960年第一季度市四化运动先进单位，1959年市文教群英会先进单位，1959年区文教群英会红旗单位，1959年广西人民广播电台一等优秀集体记者和一等优秀文艺通讯组，电台有45％的职工被评为市级各种先进工作者或积极分子。
