Xinhua News Agency, June 21st -- Amidst the surging nationwide tide of resolute opposition to American imperialist aggression and angry condemnation of the "plague god" Eisenhower's bandit-like trip, the War to Resist America, Aid Korea Hall of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum solemnly opened this afternoon. This is a component of the Chinese people's "Propaganda Week Against American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace." The thieving face of American imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of world peace, with its inherent aggression, and its paper tiger essence of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak, is concentratedly and greatly exposed here. The immortal achievements of the Chinese and Korean peoples fighting side by side to defeat American aggression and defend world peace will forever shine with the sun and the moon.

Marshal Chen Yi, Luo Ruiqing, Tan Zheng, Guo Moruo, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Liao Chengzhi, Bao Erhan, Fu Zuoyi, and others visited the War to Resist America, Aid Korea Hall today.

Today, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum was bustling with people, and the music of the "Volunteer Army Battle Song" resounded. Huge banners were hung high on the magnificent building: "American Imperialism is the Most Ferocious Enemy of World Peace!" "We Must Liberate Taiwan!" "People of the World, Unite and Smash the Aggression and War Policies of American Imperialism!"

At 3 p.m., the golden giant doors of the War to Resist America, Aid Korea Hall slowly opened. More than two thousand historical relics and pictures are displayed here, covering the entire period of the great War to Resist America, Aid Korea, from the American imperialist planning of the war of aggression against Korea until they were beaten to the point of bowing their heads and being forced to accept the armistice, and the triumphant return of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Here, viewers can see the various pieces of evidence of how, ten years ago, American imperialism launched its long-premeditated war of aggression against Korea, armed and occupied our territory of Taiwan, and disregarded our people's repeated warnings, boldly crossed the 38th Parallel, extended the flames of war to the banks of the Yalu River, bombed our territory, and murdered our compatriots. They can also see the moving historical traces of the great Chinese people launching a vigorous War to Resist America, Aid Korea movement, sending their outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteers—across the Yalu River, to jointly strike the aggressors with the Korean people, and ending the Korean War in three years of heroic fighting, eliminating more than 1.09 million enemy troops, with the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples and the disastrous defeat of American imperialism. Here, there are the brilliant instructions of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao on the War to Resist America, Aid Korea struggle; there are the commemorative artifacts of the Volunteers braving ice and snow to bravely annihilate the enemy in the early stage of entering Korea; there are the physical objects, pictures, models, and important captured items of famous battles such as the first to fifth campaigns, the Battle of Shangganling, and the Battle of Kumsong; there is evidence of American imperialism's germ warfare crimes; there are the deeds and relics of famous heroes such as Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, and Qiu Shaoyun; there are cultural relics and pictures reflecting the Korean armistice negotiations and exposing the ugly faces of American imperialism's consistent duplicity in the negotiations; there are various souvenirs marking the lofty combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and their armies and their jointly achieved great victory. People can clearly see from here that the seemingly powerful American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. As long as the people of all countries unite and wage a resolute struggle, the American bandits will not be able to escape the fate of a miserable defeat.

After carefully viewing the various exhibits, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, excitedly told reporters that the towering crimes of American imperialism's aggression against Korea must not be tolerated. This bloody war of aggression was planned ten years ago by the warmonger Dulles himself near the 38th Parallel. Ten years later, American imperialism and its puppet troops still occupy South Korea. Recently, the head of American imperialism, Eisenhower, after trampling on our territory of Taiwan, personally went to the vicinity of the 38th Parallel to cheer on his invading troops. These facts fully prove that the war-loving nature of imperialism will never change. American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, and the most ferocious enemy of world peace. As long as imperialism exists, world peace will be seriously threatened. To defend world peace, the people of the world must unite and fight American imperialism to the end.

Guo Moruo emphasized that the great victory of Resisting America, Aiding Korea proves Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis: imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The brilliant victory of Resisting America, Aiding Korea provides a model for resolutely dealing with imperialism. The friendship forged in blood by the Chinese and Korean people is unbreakable and is a guarantee for defending peace in Asia. We firmly believe that the Korean people will surely drive American imperialism out of South Korea and achieve peaceful reunification. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and must drive American imperialism out of the Taiwan Strait.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, led a delegation to Korea to express condolences during the most difficult years of the War to Resist America, Aid Korea, and led the Chinese people in a delegation to welcome the returning Volunteer Army to warmly welcome the "most beloved people" back to the country amidst triumphant songs. After the visit, he told reporters that the War to Resist America, Aid Korea Hall fully reflects the heroic spirit of the Chinese and Korean people in opposing American imperialism, and reflects the true face of American imperialism as a paper tiger that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

After carefully viewing many weapons seized by the Volunteers from the American invading army, Liao Chengzhi said that among these captured weapons, in addition to those manufactured by American imperialism, there are also those manufactured by Japan, which is worthy of people's vigilance, especially today, when American imperialism and the Japanese traitorous government Kishi Nobusuke running dogs are trying to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and revive Japanese militarism, which is even more worthy of everyone's vigilance.

Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yongho, also gave a speech to reporters during his visit. He said that this visit reminded him again of the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against Korea and the massacre of the Korean people, and he felt very angry. He pointed out that American imperialists are the most barbaric executioners and the most ferocious enemies of the people of the world.

Ambassador Li Yongho said that in recent years, American imperialism is still expanding military bases everywhere and pursuing policies of aggression and war everywhere. Imperialism is always imperialism, and its nature will never change. We have never had any illusions about it, and we will not have any in the future. The ambassador said that modern revisionists are trying to whitewash American imperialism, which we will never believe and resolutely oppose.

Ambassador Li Yongho said that we demand peace, but we will never beg for peace. If the enemy dares to provoke war again, the Chinese and Korean people will join hands and give the enemy an even heavier blow. He said that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East was resolutely opposed by the people of Asia. We must work harder to drive American imperialism out of South Korea, out of China's territory of Taiwan, out of South Vietnam, and out of the Asian region, and defend peace in Asia and the world.

Former Volunteer Army heroes who have made immortal contributions to the motherland and peace, wearing glittering medals and orders on their chests, were warmly welcomed and respected by the audience during their visit. With their own victorious record of defeating American aggressors, they thoroughly exposed the aggressive nature and "paper tiger" essence of American imperialism to the audience. They angrily condemned the "plague god" Eisenhower, who was stained with the blood of the Korean people, for climbing onto Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, and unanimously expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan, resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle against American aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and resolutely fight American imperialism to the end. Zhang Xinyuan, the regimental commander who commanded and led his troops to defend their position for more than 30 days and nights and annihilated a large number of enemies in the world-shaking Battle of Shangganling, stood in front of the large sand table of the "Battle of Shangganling" and introduced to the audience who visited with him the combat scenes of how they severely attacked the American invading army that year. Li Baocheng, the company commander of the "Iron Eighth Company" of Shangganling, also introduced the moving deeds of his heroic company, which stubbornly defended the tunnels for fourteen days and nights under extremely difficult conditions and annihilated a large number of enemies. They said angrily that the American invading army must get out of Taiwan, get out of Korea, and get out of Asia. If they insist on staying, they will encounter Shangganling everywhere. Zhang Jihui and Wu Shengkai, famous former Volunteer Air Force heroes, and Li Shiying, the Volunteer Air Force squadron leader who once led a squadron to shoot down and damage 14 enemy aircraft, introduced to the audience their record of severely attacking American air bandits and shattering the myth of America's so-called "air superiority." Zhang Jihui stood in front of the wreckage of the plane piloted by the American "ace" pilot Davis that he shot down and said excitedly: "American imperialism has long been our defeated army. If the American bandits still want to compete, Davis is their shameful end."

Also visiting the War to Resist America, Aid Korea Hall today were Xu Deheng, Shi Liang, Xu Guangping, Guo Zechen, and Liu Xiyuan, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations; Yang Chengwu, Fu Zhong, Xiao Hua, Gan Siqi, Li Zhimin, Qiu Huizuo, Cheng Jun, Cui Tianmin, Hu Qicai, and Zhu Ming, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and people from all walks of life in the capital. Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China and some foreign experts in Beijing, as well as foreign guests visiting the capital, were also invited to visit.

During a rest break, Marshal Chen Yi, General Luo Ruiqing, and General Tan Zheng met with Zhang Jihui, a first-class hero of the former Volunteer Army, Wu Shengkai, a second-class hero, and Li Weibin, a tank commander who was awarded first-class and second-class merits in combat, pilot Li Shiying, regimental commander Li Shiying, company commander Li Baocheng, etc., who were visiting together, and had cordial talks with them. Korean Ambassador to China Li Yongho also met with former Volunteer Army heroes and meritorious personnel during the visiting break and had cordial exchanges with them.

    抗美援朝的光辉胜利是对付帝国主义的范例
    中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆昨日开放
    二千多件史料集中暴露了美帝国主义的强盗面目和外强中干的纸老虎原形
    新华社21日讯　在全国人民汹涌澎湃地坚决反对美帝国主义侵略、愤怒谴责“瘟神”艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的燎原怒火中，中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆今天下午隆重开放。这是中国人民“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的一个组成部分。世界和平最凶恶的死敌美帝国主义侵略成性的强盗面目及其外强中干的纸老虎原形在这里得到了集中的大暴露。中朝人民并肩打败美国侵略、保卫世界和平的不朽功勋，永远与日月同辉。
    陈毅元帅、罗瑞卿、谭政、郭沫若、李维汉、陈叔通、廖承志、包尔汉、傅作义等今天参观了抗美援朝战争馆。
    今天，中国人民革命军事博物馆人群川流不息，“志愿军战歌”乐声嘹亮。雄伟的建筑物上高悬着巨幅标语：“美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶的敌人！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”“全世界人民团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策！”
    下午三时，抗美援朝战争馆金色巨门徐徐敞开。这里陈列着从美帝国主义策划侵朝战争直到它们被朝中人民军队打得低下头来被迫接受停战，中国人民志愿军凯旋归国，整个伟大抗美援朝时期的历史文物、图片二千多件。观众们在这里可以看到，十年前，美帝国主义发动蓄谋已久的侵朝战争，武装霸占我国领土台湾，并无视我国人民的一再警告，大举越过三八线，把战火延烧到鸭绿江边，轰炸我国领土和杀害我国同胞的种种罪证；可以看到伟大中国人民掀起轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，派遣自己的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民共同打击侵略者，在三年多的英勇战斗中，消灭敌军一百零九万多人，以朝中人民的伟大胜利和美帝国主义的惨重失败结束的朝鲜战争的动人史迹。这里有我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于抗美援朝斗争的英明指示；有志愿军入朝初期餐冰饮雪、奋勇歼敌的纪念文物；有第一到第五次战役、上甘岭、金城反击战等著名战役的实物、图片、模型和重要缴获品；有美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证；有杨根思、黄继光、丘少云等著名英雄的事迹和遗物；有反映朝鲜停战谈判、揭露美帝国主义在谈判中一贯玩弄两面手法的丑恶嘴脸的文物和图片；有标志中朝两国人民及其军队之间的崇高战斗友谊和共同取得伟大胜利的各种纪念品。人们从这里可以清楚地看到，貌似强大的美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。只要各国人民团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，美国强盗就无法逃脱惨败的命运。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若仔细观看了展出的各种展品后激动地对记者说，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的滔天罪行是决不能容忍的。这次血腥的侵略战争，是十年前战争贩子杜勒斯亲自到三八线附近去策划的，十年后的今天，美帝国主义和他的仆从军队依然霸占着南朝鲜，最近，美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔紧接着践踏我国领土台湾之后，又亲自到三八线附近去为他的侵略军打气。这些事实充分证明：帝国主义好战成性的本质是决不会改变的。美帝国主义是中朝人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，是世界和平最凶恶的敌人。只要帝国主义存在一天，世界和平就受到严重威胁。为了保卫世界和平，全世界人民必须团结起来，和美帝国主义斗争到底。
    郭沫若强调指出，抗美援朝的伟大胜利证明了毛主席的英明论断：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。抗美援朝的光辉胜利，提供了坚决对付帝国主义的范例。中朝人民用鲜血结成的友谊是牢不可破的，是保卫亚洲和平的保证。我们深信，朝鲜人民一定能够把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，实现和平统一。中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要把美帝国主义从台湾海峡赶出去。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，在抗美援朝战争最艰苦的年代，曾经率领赴朝慰问团入朝慰问，又在凯歌声中率领中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团热情欢迎“最可爱的人”归国。他在参观后对记者说，抗美援朝战争馆充分反映了中朝人民反对美帝国主义的英雄气概，反映了美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎的真面目。
    廖承志在仔细观看了志愿军缴获美国侵略军的许多武器后说，在这些缴获的武器中，除了美帝国主义制造的以外，还有日本制造的，这是值得人们警惕的，特别是在今天，美帝国主义同日本卖国政府岸信介走狗正力图强行通过日美军事同盟条约，复活日本军国主义，更是值得大家警惕的。
    朝鲜驻我国大使李永镐在参观中也对记者发表了谈话。他说，这次参观使他重新想起美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、屠杀朝鲜人民的罪行，感到非常愤怒。他指出，美帝国主义者是最野蛮的刽子手，世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    李永镐大使说，近年来美帝国主义仍在到处扩建军事基地、到处推行侵略政策和战争政策，帝国主义总是帝国主义，它的本质是永远不会改变的。我们对它从来没有、今后也不会有任何幻想。大使说，现代修正主义者企图为美帝国主义搽粉，我们不但永远不会相信，并且坚决反对。
    李永镐大使说，我们要求和平，但是我们绝不乞求和平，如果敌人胆敢再一次挑起战争，朝中两国人民将并肩携手，给敌人以更沉重的打击。他说，艾森豪威尔的这次远东之行，受到亚洲人民的坚决反对，我们要更加努力，把美帝国主义从南朝鲜、从中国领土台湾、从南越和亚洲地区赶出去，保卫亚洲和世界和平。
    为祖国与和平建树了不朽功勋的前志愿军英雄们，胸前挂着金光闪闪的奖章和勋章，在参观中受到观众的热烈欢迎和尊敬。他们以自己亲身击败美国侵略者的胜利战绩，向观众彻底揭露美帝国主义的侵略本性和“纸老虎”原形。他们愤怒谴责沾满朝鲜人民鲜血的“瘟神”艾森豪威尔爬上朝鲜和我国领土台湾，一致表示坚决解放台湾、坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美国侵略，和平统一祖国的正义斗争，坚决和美帝国主义斗争到底。曾经在震撼世界的上甘岭大捷中，指挥和率领部队坚守阵地三十多个昼夜，消灭大量敌人的团长张信元，站在“上甘岭战役”的大沙盘前，向一起参观的观众们介绍了他们当年痛击美国侵略军的战斗情景。上甘岭“钢铁第八连”的连长李保成也介绍了他的英雄连队，在极端艰苦的情况下，顽强坚守坑道十四昼夜，消灭大量敌人的动人事迹。他们愤怒地说，美国侵略军必须从台湾滚出去，从朝鲜滚出去，从亚洲滚出去。如果它们硬是赖着不走，他们到处都会碰到上甘岭，著名的前志愿军空军英雄张积慧、吴胜凯和曾经率领一个中队击落击伤敌机十四架的志愿军空军中队长李世英，向观众们介绍了他们痛击美国空中强盗，使美国的所谓“空中优势”神话破产的战绩。张积慧站在他击落的美国“王牌”飞行员戴维斯驾驶的飞机残骸前激昂地说：“美帝国主义早已是我们的手下败兵了。美国强盗如果还想较量的话，戴维斯就是它们的可耻下场。”
    今天参观抗美援朝战争馆的还有各民主党派各人民团体负责人许德珩、史良、许广平、郭则沉、刘西元，中国人民解放军高级将领杨成武、傅钟、萧华、甘泗淇、李志民、丘会作、成钧、崔田民、胡奇才、朱明，以及首都各界人士。各国驻华使节和在北京的部分外国专家，以及在首都访问的各国外宾也应邀进行了参观。
    参观休息时，陈毅元帅、罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将等会见了在一起参观的前志愿军一级英雄张积慧、二级英雄吴胜凯和在战斗中荣立一等功、二等功的坦克车长李维斌、飞行员李世英、团长李世英、连长李保成等，并和他们进行了亲切谈话。朝鲜驻我国大使李永镐也在参观休息时会见了前志愿军英雄、功臣，和他们进行了亲切交谈。
