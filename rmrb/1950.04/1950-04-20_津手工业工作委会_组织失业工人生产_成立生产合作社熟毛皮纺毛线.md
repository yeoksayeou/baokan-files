    Organizes Unemployed Workers for Production

    Establishes Production Cooperatives for Tanning Hides and Spinning Wool

    [From Our Correspondent] In order to organize the production of unemployed workers and famine refugees and solve their livelihood problems, the Tianjin Handicraft Industry Working Committee has specially organized production cooperatives. These cooperatives are purely labor combinations, and under the leadership of the Handicraft Industry Working Committee, they process goods for the North China Leather and Fur Company. The main tasks are tanning hides and spinning wool by female workers. The Leather and Fur Company pays the cooperative wages based on the complexity of the product processing, and then the cooperative pays the members according to their labor. Currently, each person can spin up to nine catties of yarn per day, earning wages equivalent to six catties and twelve ounces of rice; ordinary workers can spin three catties, earning wages equivalent to two catties and four ounces of rice. Since the organization began in June of last year and lasted until February of this year, it has developed into three processing factories, with a total of thirteen male workers (hide tanners) and six hundred and ten female workers (yarn spinners), and over a thousand people by early April. Taking the Second Wool Spinning Factory under the cooperative as an example, the factory has a total of 240 workers, and in January, it produced 17,947 catties of wool yarn, receiving processing fees from the Leather and Fur Company totaling 33,650 catties of corn flour. At the then market price of 850 yuan per catty, this was equivalent to 28,600,339 yuan in Renminbi. After deducting expenses for wages, wool carding fees, rent, electricity, water, coal, and other spinning wheel oil, there was a surplus of 2.5 million yuan, equivalent to about 2,940 catties of corn flour. According to the above situation, if the factory can spin an average of 545 catties of wool yarn per day, it can break even; and the current actual output of the factory is an average of 598 catties per day. According to the cooperative's articles of association, 60 percent of the surplus is used for expanded reproduction, and 20 percent is used as labor insurance funds, but this provision has not yet been implemented, and all the current surplus is used for expanded reproduction.

    组织失业工人生产
    成立生产合作社熟毛皮纺毛线
    【本报讯】天津市手工业工作委员会，为了组织失业工人及逃荒农民的生产并解决其生活问题，特地组织了生产合作社。此种合作社纯系劳动力组合，在手工工委会领导下，为华北皮毛公司作加工活，主要是熟毛皮和女工纺毛，由皮毛公司按产品加工繁简付给合作社工资，然后再由合作社按劳付给社员。现纺线每日每人最多能纺九斤线，可得工资米六斤十二两；普通者亦可纺三斤，可得工资米二斤四两。自去年六月开始组织到今年二月为止，已经发展到三个加工工厂，计有男工（熟皮工人）十三人，女工（纺线工人）六百一十人，迄至四月初已有千余人。以该合作社所属第二纺毛厂为例，该厂共有工人二百四十人，一月份产毛线一七、九四七斤，从皮毛公司领到加工费三三、六五○余斤玉米面，按当时市价八百五十元一斤，合人民币二八、六○○、三三九元；除支出工资、弹毛费、房、电、水、煤及其他纺车用油等支出外，尚盈余二五○万元，合玉米面二、九四○斤左右，根据以上情形看，每日该厂如平均能纺五四五斤毛线，即可做到不赔不赚；而目前该厂的实际产量是平均每日五九八斤。按社章规定：盈余的百分之六十用作扩大再生产，百分之二十作劳保金，惟此项规定现尚未实行，目前全部盈余均用作扩大再生产。（吴方）
