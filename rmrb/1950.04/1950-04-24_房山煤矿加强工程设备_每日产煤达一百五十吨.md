　　Fangshan Coal Mine Strengthens Engineering Equipment, Daily Coal Production Reaches 150 Tons
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the People's Government vigorously invested in the renovation of the Fangshan Mine of the Jingxi Coal Mining Company last year, the underground engineering has now been completed, and the daily coal production can reach about 150 tons. The Fangshan Coal Mine is located on the west side of the Jinghan Railway, 50 li away from Liangxiang Station, with reserves of 200 million tons, belonging to the Jurassic coal seam. If calculated at a daily output of 5,000 tons, it can be mined for more than a century. The famous "Fangshan Gao Mo" sold in Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding is produced here. During the period when the Kuomintang bandit gang managed the mine, the coal mining tunnels collapsed and were unbearable, with a daily output of only ten tons. The safety of the workers' lives was even more unguaranteed. After the liberation of Beijing, in order to guarantee the daily coal consumption of Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding, the People's Government invested heavily in opening up the downhill slope, widening the flat tunnels, and erecting high-voltage transmission lines from Liangxiang to the mine. The high-line railway and machinery equipment from Tuoli to the mine have also been installed. More than 80 dormitories for employees have been built, with bathrooms, clinics, workers' clubs, etc. Currently, more than 800 workers are actively producing, and it is expected that the daily coal production of the mine will reach 700 to 800 tons in half a year.

　　房山煤矿加强工程设备  每日产煤达一百五十吨
    【本报讯】京西煤矿公司房山矿厂，自去年人民政府大力投资整顿后，现已重点完成地下工程，每日可产煤一百五十吨左右。房山煤矿位于京汉路西侧，距良乡车站五十华里，蕴藏量达两亿吨，为侏罗纪煤层。如以日产五千吨计，可开采百年以上。京、津、保等地销售的有名“房山高末”即产于此。该矿在国民党匪帮管理时期，采煤巷道坍塌不堪，每日仅产煤十余吨。工人生命安全更毫无保障。北京解放后，人民政府为保障京、津、保等地日常用煤，即大量投资开凿了下山斜坡，加宽平洞，架设了良乡至矿厂高压输电线。坨里至矿厂高线铁路、机器设备亦已安装就绪。并建筑有职工宿舍八十余间，设有浴室、医疗所、工人俱乐部等。目前八百余工人正积极生产，预计半年后达到该矿每日产煤将达七、八百吨。
