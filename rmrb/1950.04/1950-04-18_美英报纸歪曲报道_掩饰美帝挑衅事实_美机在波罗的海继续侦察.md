　　US and British Newspapers Distort Reports, Concealing US Imperialist Provocation Facts
    US Planes Continue Reconnaissance in the Baltic Sea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] A comprehensive TASS dispatch of the 15th reports: American bourgeois newspapers continue to distort the facts of the US plane's invasion of Soviet borders, deliberately concealing facts that would reveal the true purpose of the US air activities in the Baltic Sea region. The newspapers deliberately downplay the Soviet statement regarding the US plane's brazen invasion of the Soviet border and its opening fire on Soviet planes first. The newspapers only publish in a minor position that the missing plane was equipped with reconnaissance radar and aerial photography equipment, as well as onboard personnel, including three radar experts. American bourgeois newspapers also deliberately ignore that the "search" for the missing plane is actually a cover for accusations of American aerial reconnaissance in the Baltic Sea region. The New York Times published a dispatch from Frankfurt on the 12th saying, "People here point out that the Baltic coast is an interesting place for aerial reconnaissance," which exposes the motives of American aerial activities in the Baltic Sea region.
    British bourgeois newspapers continue to attempt to distort the US plane's invasion of Soviet territory and the resulting Soviet protest. The Daily Mail glosses over the fact that the US plane invaded Soviet airspace and opened fire first, but instead demands politeness. The newspaper laments that the Soviet note "did not express a word of regret, but only protested against the 'serious violation' of their territory."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] According to a TASS dispatch of the 16th: The so-called "search" for the missing US plane in the Baltic Sea area is in fact a large-scale reconnaissance operation. This operation is still ongoing. According to London Broadcasting, the US Air Force Command in Wiesbaden, Germany, announced that the various aircraft at the airport near Copenhagen will maintain their current number. Fifty aircraft will participate daily in the "search for traces of the missing aircraft."

　　美英报纸歪曲报道  掩饰美帝挑衅事实
    美机在波罗的海继续侦察
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社十五日电：美国资产阶级报纸继续对美机侵犯苏联边境的事实作歪曲的报道，故意掩饰那些足以表明美国在波罗的海地区空中活动真实目的的事实。各报故意不重视苏联所发表的关于美机蛮横侵犯苏联边境并首先向苏机开火的声明。各报仅以次要地位刊载消息说：失踪的飞机装有侦察雷达和空中照像器材，并有机上工作人员，其中包括三个雷达专家。美国资产阶级报纸并故意漠视关于“寻找”失踪的飞机，实际上是掩盖对美国在波罗的海地区空中侦察的指责。纽约时报十二日登载法兰克福的电讯说：“此间人士指出，波罗的海海岸是空中侦察的一个有趣味的地方”，这就暴露了美国在波罗的海地区空中活动的动机。
    英国资产阶级报纸继续企图歪曲美国飞机侵犯苏联领土以及由此而来的苏联的抗议。每日邮报抹煞美国飞机侵犯苏联领空并首先开火的事实，却反而要求礼貌。该报慨叹苏联照会“没有只字表示遗憾，而只对‘严重侵犯”它们领土的行为，提出抗议。”
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社十六日讯：关于在波罗的海区对失踪美机的所谓“搜寻”，事实上就是一次大规模的侦察行动。这种行动仍在进行中。据伦敦广播，驻德国威斯巴登美空军司令部发表：在哥本哈根附近机场中的各种飞机，仍将保持现有数目。每日将有五十架飞机参加“寻找失踪飞机的踪迹”。
