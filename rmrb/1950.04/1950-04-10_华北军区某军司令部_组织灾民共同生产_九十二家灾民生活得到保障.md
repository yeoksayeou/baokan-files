　　Headquarters of a Certain Army of the North China Military Region
　　Organizes Disaster Victims for Joint Production
　　Ninety-Two Disaster-Stricken Families' Livelihoods Guaranteed
　　Sharing Weal and Woe with the People!

　　[Report from this newspaper] The headquarters of a certain army of the North China Military Region, concerned about the lives of disaster victims, has, through various efforts, organized the first group of fifty-three disaster victims to participate in the army's directly-subordinated labor brigade on March 26th. A second group of thirty-nine people has also been organized. Currently, most of these disaster victims, who are largely accompanied by their families, are actively engaged in production, and their livelihoods have been guaranteed.

　　Some disaster victims from Baodi, Fengrun, Yutian, and other counties, because the water in the fields has not receded, are unable to carry out spring plowing and have gone to Tangshan to beg for food. After learning about this situation, the army leaders planned to help the government organize the disaster victims for production and self-salvation; and to participate with the army's directly-subordinated labor brigade in the construction of the Tangshan Steel Plant. Immediately, dedicated personnel were dispatched to cooperate with the government in conducting investigations and registrations; and 1,800 jin of millet were lent to the disaster victims to solve their current food problem. At the same time, negotiations were conducted with the factory. Initially, the factory had some concerns, but the army leaders were determined to withdraw some of the troops' labor force to give the disaster victims work. The factory did not want the troops to withdraw personnel (because the troops were very active in their labor, and the factory was very satisfied). Later, consultations were held with the labor bureau. Finally, the army proposed to take responsibility for organizing and educating the disaster victims to ensure that work would not be affected in the slightest. In this way, on March 26th, fifty-three disaster victims began work. The person in charge of the army's directly-subordinated labor brigade organized them into a disaster victim team, appointed Pei Zhiguo, a disabled soldier from Fengrun County, as the captain, and divided them into five groups according to the county, democratically electing group leaders, and working together with the troops. The troops conducted daily awards and evaluations, and the soldiers constantly carried out propaganda and education among them during their work. The vast majority of them are poor and lower-middle peasants. Although they were initially pale and emaciated, each carrying at most five or six pieces of broken cakes (begged for) as lunch, eating only two or three pieces and reluctant to eat more, leaving them for their children and wives; but when they started working, they were very self-conscious. Ten hours a day, except for lunch, they never took a break, and no one was lazy. On the first day, gloves were not yet distributed. When carrying large stones weighing hundreds of jin, they almost wore off the old skin on their hands, revealing tender red skin, but no one complained of hardship. Guo Zhongsan's foot was broken by a stone, but he said, "I can't rest. If I rest, I'll be letting down our troops!" He still limps along as he works. Meng Xianhui, Wang Kun, and others, from the beginning until now, have worked ten hours a day without rest (except for lunch), and their work efficiency is very high. The factory is satisfied and says, "Anyone can work hard once they come to the People's Liberation Army!"

　　The disaster victims are not only highly motivated in their work but have also taken a step forward in their understanding. Initially, they reflected, "The People's Liberation Army saved our lives, and we can't let down the troops if we don't work hard." But now they further understand that the People's Liberation Army is the people's army, truly sharing food and hardship with the people. Some even realize the glory and importance of production for self-salvation and national construction. For example, an older disaster victim called on everyone during work, "Work hard! This is not for the capitalists, this is for the country!" The troops provided them with various forms of education and appropriate management; and took care of their health, such as teaching them how to pay attention to hygiene, washing their hands and faces before meals, and advising them to eat their fill. Now their sallow faces have regained some color; they are no longer frowning all day long but are talking and laughing. Many people are preparing their strength, waiting for the water to recede so that they can go home and farm. In particular, upon hearing the news that the troops are digging rivers and building dikes in their hometowns to eliminate harm for the people, they are overjoyed and say, "The troops are truly considering everything for us. Once this river is repaired, we will never suffer again!" The factory has also increased its confidence in the disaster victims' work and has requested the troops to organize more disaster victims. Recently, a second group of thirty-nine people has started work. Each person earns eight jin and twelve liang of millet a day, guaranteeing the livelihood of the whole family. (Dong Ren)

　　华北军区某军司令部
    组织灾民共同生产           
    九十二家灾民生活得到保障
    和人民同甘苦共患难！                  
    【本报讯】华北军区某军司令部关心灾民生活，经过多方努力，已于三月二十六日组织起第一批五十三个灾民参加军直劳动大队，第二批又组织了三十九人。现在这批大部分带有家口的灾民，正在积极生产，生活上已经有了保证。
    宝坻、丰润、玉田等县的部分灾民，因为地里积水没退，无法春耕，到唐山要饭。该部了解这情况后，军首长就计划帮助政府组织灾民生产自救；和军直劳动大队一起参加修建唐山制钢厂的工作。随即派了专人协同政府进行调查登记；并以一千八百斤小米借给灾民，解决他们目前吃饭问题。同时向工厂交涉，起初厂方有些顾虑，军首长就决心抽回部队一部分劳动力，让给灾民工作。厂方又不愿意部队抽出人（因为部队劳动积极，厂方非常满意）。后来又向劳动局商量，最后该部提出负责组织教育灾民，保证工作不受丝毫损失。这样，三月二十六日，五十三个灾民开始上工。军直劳动大队负责人把他们编成一个灾民队，指定丰润县荣誉军人裴治国为队长，下按县划分五个小组，民主选举组长，和部队在一起劳动。每天由部队进行奖评，战士们在工作中不断对他们进行宣传教育。他们绝大多数是贫雇农，起初虽然面黄肌瘦，每人最多带五、六块碎饼子（讨来的）当午饭，只吃二、三块就舍不得吃了，留给孩子老婆；可是干起活来，都非常自觉，一天十个钟头，除了吃午饭，一回不休歇，也没一个偷懒的。第一天手套没发下来，搬运百十斤的大石头，差不多把手上的老皮都磨掉了，露出红嫩的肉皮，但没一个人说苦的。郭仲三叫石头砸破了脚，还说：“我怎也不能歇，歇了对不起咱们部队！”到现在还是一拐一拐的干。孟贤惠、王坤等从开始到现在，那天都十个钟头一会不歇（除吃午饭），工作效率很高，厂方就满意的说：“什么人一到解放军就能干了！”
    灾民不仅工作情绪高，在认识上也提高了一步，起初反映：“解放军救了咱的命，不好好干对不起部队。”但现在进一步明白了解放军是老百姓的队伍，和人民真是有饭同吃，有难同当。更有的认识到生产自救和建设国家的光荣和重要，如一个年纪较老的灾民在工作中号召大家：“干呀！这可不是给资本家干哪，这是为国家干呢！”部队对他们进行各种教育及适当的管理；并照顾他们的健康，如教他们如何讲卫生，吃饭前洗手洗脸，劝他们要吃饱饭。现在他们焦黄的脸上已有了血色；不是整天愁眉不展，而是有说有笑了。好多人都准备力量，等水下去，好回家种地。尤其听到部队在他们家乡挖河修堤，为民除害的消息，更是高兴的了不得，都说：“部队真是处处为咱们打算，这河修好了，咱就永远不遭难了！”厂方对灾民的工作，也提高了信心，就要求部队再给组织灾民。最近第二批三十九人又上了工。每人一天赚八斤十二两小米，全家的生活有了保证。（冬人）
