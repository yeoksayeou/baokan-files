Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Vice Minister Mao Qiuhua of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government issued a statement regarding the relief of unemployed workers in Shanghai:

　　After seeing the letter from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions regarding the relief of unemployed workers, we express our deep concern for the suffering of unemployed workers in Shanghai. We fully agree with this method of appealing to workers across the country for mutual assistance and relief, and we believe that workers across the country will surely display class friendship and provide consistent sympathy and assistance to brothers suffering from unemployment. However, at present, a considerable number of unemployed workers exist not only in Shanghai, but also in major cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing, Beijing, and Tianjin. This is not just a problem for the working class, but a problem concerning the entire people of the country. Therefore, not only should workers across the country demonstrate the spirit of class friendship, but people from all walks of life should actively respond to this call for relief. At the same time, we are also studying more concrete and planned relief measures to alleviate the current suffering of unemployed workers.

　　This phenomenon of unemployment is the result of the long-term sinful rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China for over a century, the result of war damage over the past ten years and the serious disasters in various places last year, the result of the fact that land reform has not been carried out in vast areas, farmers' lives are poor, and purchasing power is low, the result of the recent stabilization of prices, and the collapse of industrial and commercial enterprises that have relied solely on speculation and profiteering for many years with the end of inflation, and the result of the blockade and bombing by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Therefore, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions said in its letter: "As long as the Chiang bandits are annihilated and Taiwan is recovered, Shanghai's economy will begin to improve; and after the implementation of land reform and the increase of farmers' purchasing power, the national industrial and commercial situation can be fundamentally resolved, the unemployment problem can be gradually resolved, and the lives of workers will gradually improve." This is very reasonable. Therefore, the capitalists and employees of various industrial and commercial enterprises should consult together, find concrete ways to overcome difficulties, and tide over the difficulties. At the same time, the working class and people from all walks of life across the country should be mobilized to provide emergency relief to unemployed workers on the one hand, and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army, completely eliminate the Chiang bandits, recover Hainan Island and Taiwan, and eliminate the last nest of the reactionaries on the other hand, striving for the early arrival of the improvement of the overall economic situation.

　　劳动部毛副部长发表谈话
    号召援助沪失业工人     
    坚决支援解放军消灭残匪  争取整个经济情况的好转
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府劳动部毛齐华副部长对于救济上海失业工人发表谈话：
    我们看到了上海总工会给全国总工会关于救济失业工人的一封信之后，对于上海失业工人的生活痛苦表示深深的关怀。我们完全同意这个向全国工人兄弟呼吁互助救济的办法，并且相信全国工人一定都能发挥阶级友爱，给予遭受失业痛苦的弟兄以一致的同情和援助。但在目前，不仅上海一地，而且在武汉、南京、北京、天津等各大城市中都存在着相当数量的失业工人，这不单是工人阶级的问题，而是有关全国人民的整个问题。因此，不只是全国职工要发挥出阶级友爱的精神，并且全国各界人士都应该踊跃地起来响应这个救济的号召。同时，我们也正在研究比较更具体的有计划的救济办法，以减轻失业工人当前的痛苦。
    这种失业的现象是由于中国百余年来受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期罪恶统治所造成的结果，是由于十几年来的战争破坏以及去年各地严重灾荒的结果，是由于广大的地区尚未进行土地改革、农民生活贫困、购买力低弱的结果，是由于最近物价开始稳定，多年来专靠投机倒把而获利的工商业随着通货膨胀的终止而垮台的结果，是由于美帝国主义和国民党反动派封锁与轰炸所造成的结果，所以上海总工会的信上说：“只要歼灭蒋匪，收复台湾，上海经济便将开始好转；而在实行土地改革、提高农民购买力后、全国工商业情况便能根本好决，失业问题便可逐步解转，并且工人生活也就会逐渐改善起来。”这是很有道理的。因此，各个工商企业的资方与职工应共同协商，找出具体办法，克服困难，渡过难关；同时，全国工人阶级和各界人士，都应一致动员起来，一方面对失业工人予以紧急的救济，另一方面要坚决支援人民解放军，彻底消灭蒋匪，收复海南岛和台湾，肃清反动派的最后巢穴，争取整个经济情况好转的早日到来。
