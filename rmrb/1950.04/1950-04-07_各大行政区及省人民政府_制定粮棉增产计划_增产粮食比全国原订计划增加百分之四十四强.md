　　Major Administrative Regions and Provincial People's Governments
    Formulate Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plans
    Grain Production Increase Exceeds Original National Plan by Over Forty-Four Percent
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] All major administrative regions and provincial people's governments across the country have formulated specific plans suited to local conditions based on the national grain and cotton production increase plan adopted at the National Agricultural Production Conference this year. The plans formulated by various regions have generally raised the production increase targets, exceeding the original plans set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. According to statistics on the grain production increase plans formulated by Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, Northwest (only including Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia provinces and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps), and the suburbs of Beijing, the planned grain production increase totals 14.5 billion catties, exceeding the original planned increase figure of the National Agricultural Production Conference (the original plan did not include Guangdong, Beijing suburbs, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps production) by 4.45 billion catties, an increase of over 44 percent. The planned cotton production quantity in various regions totals 14,138,200 dan, also exceeding the original planned figure of the National Agricultural Conference by 854,200 dan, an increase of 6.43 percent. Various regions have also formulated special crop planting plans based on specific conditions. For example, Northeast plans to plant 980,000 mu of flax and 180,000 mu of tobacco, East China plans to plant 190,000 mu of flax and 11,740,000 mu of peanuts, Guangdong plans to plant 420,000 mu of sugarcane and 580,000 mu of jute, and Shandong and Zhejiang have also formulated plans to maintain and increase the yield of special crops.

    In order to ensure the realization of the above-mentioned production increase plan, the people's governments of various regions have also separately stipulated specific implementation methods. In old liberated areas, such as the Northeast region, it is stipulated that the first priority is to improve agricultural technology and increase the yield per unit area; the second is to expand the cultivated land area, and it is decided to take the organization of mutual aid teams as the basic direction for leading rural production this year. North China stipulates that labor mutual aid and agricultural technology improvement movements should be widely carried out to improve the level of cultivation, promote improved varieties, build water conservancy projects, and prevent and control pests and diseases. In general, the old liberated areas of North China can be restored to the pre-war production level this year, and some areas can exceed the pre-war level; 67 percent of the villages in Xingtai Special Zone of Hebei Province can be restored to the pre-war production level, and 33 percent of the villages can exceed the pre-war level; all 33 counties and parts of 5 counties in Shanxi Province can restore to the pre-war level; Chahar has relatively poor conditions, and efforts will also be made to restore most areas to the pre-war level next year.

    In the new liberated areas, such as the vast new areas of Northwest, East China, and Central South, it is stipulated that the first priority is to strengthen policy propaganda and stabilize the production sentiment of the peasant masses. At the same time, it is stipulated that every step of work such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, land reform, and building political power must be closely combined with the production of the masses. Among them, Central South and East China mainly focus on building water conservancy projects, increasing the purchase of agricultural tools and draft animals, and adjusting improved varieties in the specific measures for increasing production. The general new liberated areas have full confidence in maintaining the existing production level and striving for a slight increase.

    The people's governments of various regions emphasize that overcoming natural disasters is the main key to completing the 1950 production increase task for agricultural production in disaster areas. At the same time, various regions stipulate that disaster relief through production and spring plowing production should be the overriding central task in the spring, and leading cadres at all levels should go to the disaster areas to grasp the disaster relief work, emphasizing the planting of various melons, vegetables, and early-maturing crops in order to shorten the spring famine; at the same time, the difficulties of seeds and livestock in spring plowing production of disaster victims should be effectively solved to ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing. At present, Hebei Province has completed the drainage and planting of 12 million mu of wheat. The disaster area in southern Anhui has put forward the slogan of planting 0.2 mu of rapeseed per person. The trade company in the area has lent 39,000 catties of rapeseed to the disaster victims. Kenli Special Zone of Shandong Province has lent 400,000 catties of early-maturing crop seeds to the disaster victims.

    The troops in various regions are also launching large-scale agricultural production movements. The Northwest Military Region is preparing to reclaim more than 1 million mu of farmland, plant 50,000 mu of cotton, and plant more than 200,000 mu of vegetables. The troops in some areas are preparing to participate in water conservancy project construction with a large amount of manpower to ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan. The Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army are preparing to participate in railway construction and sideline production according to the objective conditions of their stationed locations, and plan to complete 150 million catties of grain.

　　各大行政区及省人民政府
    制定粮棉增产计划
    增产粮食比全国原订计划增加百分之四十四强
    【新华社六日讯】全国各大行政区、省人民政府，已根据全国农业生产会议所通过的今年全国粮棉增产计划，分别制定适合各地情况的具体计划。各地所订计划，一般都提高了增产任务，超过了中央人民政府农业部所原订的计划。据东北、华北、华东、中南、西北（仅包括陕西、甘肃、宁夏三省和新疆部队生产）和北京郊区等地所订的粮食增产计划的统计，计划增产的粮食共达一百四十五亿斤，超过全国农业生产会议原订增产计划数（原计划未包括广东、京郊和新疆部队生产在内）四十四点五亿斤，计增加百分之四十四强。各地计划的棉花生产数量共为一、四一三点八二万担，也超过全国农业会议原订计划数八五点四二万担，计增加了百分之六点四三。各地亦都根据具体情况拟定特种作物种植计划，如东北计划种麻九十八万亩、烟草十八万亩，华东计划种麻十九万亩、花生一千一百七十四万亩，广东种植甘蔗四十二万亩、黄麻五十八万亩，山东、浙江亦订出保持和提高特种作物产量的计划。
    为了保证上述增产计划的实现，各地人民政府又分别规定了具体的实施办法。在老区，如东北地区规定首先是改进农业技术，提高单位面积的产量；其次是扩大耕地面积，并决定以组织变工互助为今年领导农村生产的基本方向。华北规定广泛地开展劳动互助和改进农业技术运动，提高耕作水平，推广优良品种，兴修水利和防除病虫害等。华北一般老区可在今年恢复至战前生产水平，部分地区可超过战前水平；河北邢台专区有百分之六十七的村庄可恢复至战前生产水平，百分之三十三的村庄可超过战前水平；山西省有三十三个县全部和五个县部分村庄可恢复战前水平；察哈尔条件较差，亦争取明年大部地区恢复战前水平。
    在新区，如西北、华东和中南的广大新区，规定首先是加强政策宣传，稳定农民群众的生产情绪，同时规定剿匪、反恶霸、减租、土地改革、建政等工作的每一步骤都必须与群众生产密切相结合。其中中南、华东在增产的具体措施上是以兴修水利，增购农具、耕畜，调剂优良品种为主。一般新区对保持现有生产水平，争取略加提高，均具有充分信心。
    各地人民政府对于灾区的农业生产，都强调战胜灾荒是完成一九五○年增产任务的主要关键。同时，各地规定在春季应以生产救灾和进行春耕生产为压倒一切的中心工作，各级领导干部应亲赴灾区，掌握救灾工作，强调多种瓜菜和早熟作物以期缩短春荒；同时，并应切实解决灾民春耕生产中的籽种、牲畜等困难，以保证春耕的进行。现河北省已完成排水种麦一千二百万亩，皖南灾区提出每人种二分油菜的口号，该区贸易公司已贷给灾民三万九千斤菜籽，山东垦利专区贷给灾民早熟作物种籽四十万斤。
    各地部队亦大规模展开农业生产运动。西北军区准备垦种农田一百余万亩，植棉五万亩，种菜二十余万亩。有些地区的部队准备以大量人力参加水利工程建设，以保证完成今年增产计划。中南军区及第四野战军根据驻地的客观条件，准备参加修筑铁路和副业生产，计划完成一亿五千万斤粮食。
