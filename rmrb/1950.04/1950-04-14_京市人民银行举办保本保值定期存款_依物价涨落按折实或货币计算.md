[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, in order to adapt to the current price situation, promote thrift, reward savings, and effectively protect the interests of depositors from the impact of price fluctuations, is launching inflation-proof time deposit savings starting today (14th). When depositing, the deposit will be calculated according to the real value exchange rate on that day. When the deposit matures, if prices rise, interest will be calculated based on the real value savings; if prices fall or remain unchanged, interest will be calculated based on the original currency amount. The term ranges from a minimum of half a month to a maximum of one year, in units of half a month. The deposit amount starts from five real value units, with no upper limit. The interest rate regulations are: for those calculated based on real value savings, the monthly interest rate is 0.15% for half a month, increasing by 0.05% per half month, and all rates are calculated at 1% per month for nine months or more; when calculated in currency, the monthly interest rate is 0.3% for half a month, increasing by 0.03% per half month. This savings deposit is currently only available as a lump-sum deposit with lump-sum withdrawal. Except for government agencies, public enterprises, and cooperatives, staff, students, citizens, and people from all sectors of industry and commerce can deposit.
