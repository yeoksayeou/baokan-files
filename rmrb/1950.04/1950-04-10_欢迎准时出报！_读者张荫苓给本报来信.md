　　Welcome prompt delivery!
    To the Editor of the People's Garden:
    On March 31st, I wrote to the People's Garden to inquire about the late delivery of newspapers. On April 3rd, Comrade Ma from the People's Daily came to my place and inquired about the details. The past delivery time was indeed abnormal. At first, I thought it was due to the inconsistent publication time. Later, I saw that the posting time on the newspaper boards by the roadside was sometimes earlier than the time I received the newspaper. So I wanted to ask the delivery comrade, but I never saw him (he put the newspaper at the door and threw it in through the crack and left immediately). On March 31st, I still hadn't received the newspaper by 2:30 pm. I was anxious and wrote a letter to you, asking where the delay in the delivery time was. The next morning, I put a note on the door again, asking the delivery comrade to wait a while and ask him in person why the newspaper of the 31st hadn't been delivered. He said it was his negligence and immediately made up for the missing newspaper. I also made some suggestions to him at the time, asking him to deliver the newspaper earlier within the possible range. He also agreed, and from April 1st to today, for four days, the delivery time has indeed been much earlier, and the latest has not been later than 9:30. When Comrade Ma came, he explained the reasons for the delay in delivery to me, and I understood. Comrade Ma said that from April onwards, the publication time will be normal, and the delivery time must also be normal. If so, it is sincerely welcomed by the readers. Today, I received your letter again, specifically inquiring about this matter; I am very impressed by your spirit of serving the readers so conscientiously.
        Sincerely,
                                Reader Zhang Yinling
                                            April 4th

　　欢迎准时出报！
    读者张荫苓给本报来信编辑同志：
    三月三十一日，我为了查询迟送报纸的事情，曾写给人民园地一信，四月三日，人民日报马同志来我处，已将详细经过问明。过去送报时间确是不正常，起初我以为是出版时间不固定的原故，后来看见马路旁报牌上的贴报时间有时比我收到报纸的时间还早，于是我就想问问送报的同志，但是老是见不到他（他把报纸送到门口由门缝投进来马上就走了）。三月三十一日，到午后两点半我还没有收到报纸，我着急了，就给你们去了一封信，问问送报时间太晚究竟延误在何处。第二天一早，我又在门口贴了一张纸条，请送报同志稍等一会，当面问他三十一日的报为什么没有送来。他说，这是他疏忽了，并立刻把欠报补交给我。我当时也对他提了意见，请他在可能范围中早些送报。他也答应了，并且从四月一日到今天四天中，送报时间的确早多了，最晚也没有迟至九点半。马同志来时，把送报延误的原因讲给我好些，我才明白了。马同志说，从四月份起出版时间正常，送报时间一定也要正常了。如果这样，实在是读者所衷心欢迎的。今天，我又接到你们的来信，特为询问此事；我对你们这样认真的为读者服务的精神，很是敬佩。
        此致敬礼！
                                读者  张荫苓
                                            四月四日
