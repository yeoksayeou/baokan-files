　　Jeju Island is a Brilliant Beacon of Armed Struggle for the South Korean People
    *Democratic Korea* Comments on the Second Anniversary of the Jeju Island Uprising
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th] April 3rd marked the second anniversary of the armed uprising of the people of Jeju Island, South Korea, against the rule of the US imperialists and their running dog Syngman Rhee. *Democratic Korea*, the organ of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, published an editorial on the 3rd, stating that the armed uprising of the people of Jeju Island opened up a new path for the people of South Korea to carry out armed struggle.
    The editorial emphasized: The power of the people is invincible. The armed struggle of the people of Jeju Island has made all the people of South Korea realize that under the criminal rule of the US imperialists and their running dog Syngman Rhee gang, armed struggle is the only correct way to defend the motherland and the destiny of the people. Encouraged by this lesson, the people of South Korea have widely ignited the flames of armed struggle in various regions, crushed the Syngman Rhee gang's crazy "suppression," and greatly weakened the puppet rule in South Korea. The editorial concluded: Today, Jeju Island, though covered in blood due to the traitor Syngman Rhee's frenzied "suppression," remains a brilliant beacon of the South Korean people's armed struggle for the reunification and independence of the motherland. The People's Guerrillas are forever glorious.

　　济州岛是南朝鲜人民武装斗争的灿烂灯塔
    民主朝鲜报评济州岛起义二周年
    【新华社平壤四日电】四月三日是南朝鲜济州岛人民为反抗美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的统治而举行武装起义的二周年纪念日。朝鲜共和国最高人民会议机关报民主朝鲜报三日为此发表社论称：济州岛人民的武装起义，为南朝鲜人民开辟了进行武装斗争的新道路。
    社论强调指出：人民的力量是不可战胜的。济州岛人民的武装斗争，使南朝鲜的全体人民体验到，在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的罪恶统治下，只有进行武装斗争，才是保卫祖国和人民命运的正确方法。为这一教训所鼓舞的南朝鲜人民，已在各个地区广泛地燃起武装斗争的烽火，粉碎了李承晚匪帮的疯狂的“讨伐”，大大地削弱了南朝鲜的傀儡统治。社论结语说：今天的济州岛，虽因卖国贼李承晚的疯狂“讨伐”而血流成河，但它依然是南朝鲜人民为争取祖国统一独立的武装斗争的灿烂灯塔。人民游击队是永远光荣的。
