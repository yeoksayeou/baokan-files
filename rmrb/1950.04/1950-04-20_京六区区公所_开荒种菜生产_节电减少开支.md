The Jing No. 6 District Public Office continues to implement the production and frugality campaign. At a district affairs meeting held by the office a few days ago, it was decided to turn the wasteland in the backyard into a vegetable garden, with production areas allocated to each department. The meeting requested that each person produce 150 catties of vegetables this year, to solve one-third of the district government's vegetable expenses. In addition, it was decided to produce chalk, with the agency cooperative responsible for contacting and promoting sales. If 1,000 boxes can be produced each month, the profits will be enough to subsidize the agency's insufficient expenses. Due to the reasonable allocation of tasks, all departments have launched competitions with extremely high production enthusiasm. Now the backyard land has been cleared, and the sown vegetable seedlings have emerged. A small chalk factory has also started production.

    开荒种菜生产  节电减少开支
    【本报讯】京市六区区公所继续贯彻生产节约运动。该公所日前召开的区务会上，决定将后院荒地辟为菜园，以科室为单位分配生产面积。会议要求今年每人生产一百五十斤蔬菜，达到解决区政府三分之一的菜金开支。此外并决定生产粉笔，由机关合作社负责联络推销。如每月能制出一千匣，所获利益足够补助机关开支的不足。由于任务分配的合理，各科室都展开了竞赛，生产情绪极高。现在后院地已开出，播种的菜苗已出土。小型粉笔厂也开工了。
