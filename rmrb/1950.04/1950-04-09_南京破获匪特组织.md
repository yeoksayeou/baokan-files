　　Nanjing Cracks Down on Bandit-Spy Organization
　　[Report from this Newspaper] According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily News on March 31st, the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Chen Shihe, the pseudo "Commander of the 5th Detachment of the Suwan Special District Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army," and other bandits on January 21st, and seized guns, stolen goods, and other items. Bandit Chen was originally a squad leader of the 3rd Regiment of the Kuomintang's Anhui Security Force, and later transferred to the captain of the 2nd Battalion of the independent detachment of the pseudo "Justice Force." In the summer of the year before last, he served as the deputy captain of the 2nd Joint Defense Zone in He County. During this period, he carried out numerous illegal crimes such as open highway robbery, kidnapping, and looting. For example, in May of last year, he robbed 250 shi of rice in one instance in Niuhe, He County. After June and July, he planned three times to organize special agent armed forces, conspiring to disrupt the revolutionary order. This spring, the bandit was appointed by remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek faction as the pseudo "Commander of the 5th Detachment of the Suwan Special District Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army," engaging in open extortion and causing casualties. In the areas along the Yangtze River in Dangtu and He County, Anhui, such as Cihu River Estuary and San Shan Ying, statistics show that they were robbed 15 times in more than half a year. During a robbery in Xiaowangzhou in July of last year, he hung up an elderly couple surnamed Sha and used fire to smoke them, demanding that they hand over their property, which resulted in the old man being burned to death. In October of the lunar calendar last year, when robbing a passenger ship at Niutou River under Xiliang Mountain, Chen accidentally injured his left foot when his gun went off. Enraged, Chen ordered bandits Xu Jinlong and others to tie up three passengers and throw them into the river. Recently, he sneaked into Nanjing City to carry out activities. Finally, our Municipal Public Security Bureau detected his presence and cracked the case at Yan Dahe's clothing store on Mochou Road, arresting him and bringing him to justice.

　　南京破获匪特组织
    【本报讯】据南京新华日报三月三十一日消息：南京市公安局于一月二十一日，捕获了伪“苏皖特区反共自卫军第五总队总队长”陈世和及其他匪徒多名，并缴获枪枝赃物等多件。陈匪原系蒋匪安徽保安第三团的一个分队长，后转任伪“正义部队”独立支队第二大队队长，前年夏天又任伪和县第二联防区中队副，在此期间，即曾进行多次公开路劫、绑票、抢劫等非法罪行。如去年五月间，在和县牛河一次即抢得食米二百五十石。六、七月后，曾三次计划组织特务武装，阴谋破坏革命秩序。今春该匪被蒋系残匪委任为伪“苏皖特区反共自卫军第五总队总队长。”进行公开勒索，并伤害人命。仅安徽当涂及和县沿江一带之慈湖河口、三山英等地统计，半年余即遭其抢劫十五次。去年七月在小王洲抢劫中，曾将事主沙姓老夫妇吊起，用火熏烤，勒令交出财物，以致老头被火烧死。该匪又于去年旧历十月，在西梁山下牛头河抢劫客船时，因自己不慎，枪枝走火，打伤了左脚，陈匪即迁怒船客，令匪徒许金龙等将三个船客绑起抛入江中。最近又潜入南京市内活动，终于被我市公安局侦悉，在莫愁路严大和成衣铺内将其破获，逮捕归案。
