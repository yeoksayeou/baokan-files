Reduce Waste and Increase Food Supply
Government Administration Council Issues Decision to Change Grain Processing Standards and Implement the Use of 92 Rice and 81 Flour
Everyone Eats 92 Rice and 81 Flour
The Country Can Save 800 Million Jin of Grain Per Year
More Nutrients are Extremely Beneficial to the Body
All Grain Companies and Stores are Only Allowed to Sell Coarse Rice and Coarse Flour

[Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch] The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on changing grain processing standards and increasing edible grain (approved by the 25th meeting of the Government Administration Council on March 24, 1950).

Last year, water and drought caused food shortages in some areas. In order to overcome this difficulty, in addition to transferring grain from grain-rich areas to disaster areas and cities, we must also earnestly change grain processing methods and produce standard rice and flour, named 92 rice and 81 flour. It is hoped that the people's governments at all levels and people's organizations throughout the country will universally promote everyone eating standard rice and standard flour, saving as much grain as possible, in order to reduce the difficulty of grain supply. Our people's habits are that the countryside has always been simple and self-reliant, eating mostly whole-milled rice and ordinary flour, while cities prefer to eat double-milled or even triple-milled polished rice and first-class flour, resulting in great waste. Rough calculations show that if all regions and cities across the country stop producing polished rice and first-class flour, and everyone only eats 92 rice and 81 flour, then the country can save at least 800 million jin of grain per year. This will help our country, improve the difficulty of food shortages in some areas this year, and play a certain role in overcoming the spring famine in North China and the summer famine in the Jiangnan area this year. It must be pointed out that doing so does not limit people's food rations or the nutritional content contained in the rations. On the contrary, 92 rice and 81 flour contain more nutrients and vitamins than polished rice and refined flour, and eating them is extremely beneficial to health. This also shows that the habit of eating polished rice and refined flour is not only a waste but also the most unhygienic habit. For this reason, the following decisions are made, and it is hoped that people's governments at all levels will instruct their subordinate state-owned and private grain processing factories, state-owned and private grain trading companies, and grain stores to comply:

(1) All rice mills in large and small cities, rice milling workshops in rural areas, and people's rice mortars should only mill unhusked rice once, ensuring that at least 92 jin of edible rice are produced from every 100 jin of unhusked rice. All flour mills in large and small cities, flour milling workshops in rural areas, and people's small mills should ensure that at least 81 jin of flour are produced from every 100 jin of wheat. Whether they are state-owned or private factories and workshops, they must all comply with this from now on. Violators will be punished.

(2) All personnel in all government agencies, troops, schools, organizations, and enterprises should take the lead in responding to the government's call and eat standard rice and standard flour. All group, agency, troop, school, and enterprise public canteens, all restaurants, hotels, bakeries, biscuit factories, and other workshops must not exceed the above-mentioned precision standards in the rice and flour they produce. Violators will be punished.

(3) All public and private grain trading companies and their branches, grain stores and their branches, cooperatives, etc., should stop selling polished rice and first-class flour, only selling coarse rice and coarse flour, and make grain processing as standardized as possible. However, the sale of rice and flour below the standard is still allowed without prohibition. State-owned trading companies are responsible for canceling the price tags of polished rice and first-class flour. State-owned grain companies and cooperatives should be responsible for publicizing and persuading private grain stores, state-owned grain trading companies, and cooperatives to only sell coarse rice and coarse flour and not to sell polished rice and first-class flour.

(4) We request all health workers, doctors, and food chemistry experts to explain the nutritional value of standard rice and standard flour and their benefits to the human body based on scientific analysis and to carry out extensive publicity. All cultural and artistic workers, all newspapers, magazines, films, dramas, operas, broadcasting stations, and news agencies should conduct extensive publicity to the people, creating a habit among the people of emphasizing science and hygiene and not wasting grain, in order to achieve the purpose of changing grain processing methods and increasing edible grain.

(5) People's governments at all levels should, based on the above-mentioned measures, earnestly investigate and study the status of local grain processing factories, workshops, and grain stores, formulate specific measures to restrict the milling of polished rice and the production of refined flour and promote the eating of standard rice and standard flour, and carry out systematic organizational work.

　　减少浪费增加口粮
    政务院发布决定  改变粮食加工标准  制用九二米八一面
    人人都吃九二米八一面
    全国一年可节粮八亿斤
    营养成分多对身体好处极大
    一切粮食公司商店只许出售粗米粗面                                            
    【新华社一日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布关于改变粮食加工标准、增加食用粮食的决定（一九五零年三月二十四日政务院第二十五次政务会议通过）
    去年水旱成灾，造成某些地方粮食不足。为了克服此种困难，除从粮食富庶的地区调运粮食到灾区和城市以外，并切实改变粮食加工办法，制作标准米面，定名九二米、八一面。望全国各级人民政府、各人民团体普遍地提倡人人吃标准米，吃标准面，节约可能节约的粮食，以减少粮食供应的困难。我国人民习惯，乡村向来朴素自持，多吃元熟米和普通粉，而城市则喜吃二机以至三机精白米和头等面粉，浪费甚大。约略计算：如果全国各地方各城市一律不制精白米和头等面粉，人人只吃九二米和八一面，则全国全年至少可节约粮食八亿市斤。这样就会给我们国家以帮助，对今年某些地方缺粮的困难有所改善，对渡过今年华北各地的春荒和江南各地的夏荒将起一定的作用。必须指出：这样做，并不是限制人们的口粮额和口粮中所含的营养成分，恰恰相反，九二米和八一面所含营养成分和维生素，较之精米、精面为多，食用起来，对身体健康好处极大。这也说明：吃精米、精面的习惯，不但是一种浪费，而且是最不合卫生的习惯。为此特作如下各项决定，望各级人民政府通令所属公营的和私营的粮食加工工厂、公营的和私营的粮食贸易公司与粮食商店遵照办理：
    （一）各大、小城市的一切碾米工厂、乡村的碾米作坊和人民的舂米碾子，对所有糙米都只许碾一道，要保证每一百斤糙米至少出九十二斤食米。各大小城市的一切面粉工厂、乡村的磨面作坊和人民的小磨房，要保证每一百斤麦子至少磨出八十一斤面粉。不论是公营的和私营的工厂和作坊，今后一律要遵照执行，违者将予以处罚。
    （二）各机关、各部队、各学校、各团体和各企业部门的所有人员，均应以身作则，响应政府号召，一律食用标准米、标准面。所有团体、机关、部队、学校和各企业部门公共食堂，所有饭馆、旅店、面包坊、饼干厂等作坊，所制用的米面，均不得超过上述的精度标准，违者将予处罚。
    （三）所有公共的和私营的粮食贸易公司及其分、支公司、粮食商店及其分、支店、合作社等，应一律停止出售精白米，头等面粉，只出售粗米、粗面，并尽可能的使加工粮食标准化，但出售标准以下的米和面仍一律允许，不加禁止。国家贸易公司负责取消精白米、头等面粉的牌价。公营粮食公司和合作社应负责宣传说服各私营粮食商店和公营粮食贸易公司和合作社，只卖粗米、粗面，不卖精白米和头等面粉。
    （四）请求一切卫生工作者、医生、食品化学专家，根据科学的分析，说明标准米标准面的营养价值及对人身的好处，并作广泛的宣传。一切文化艺术工作者，一切报纸、杂志、电影、戏剧、曲艺、广播台、通讯社，应向人民作广泛宣传，在人民中造成讲科学卫生，不浪费粮食的习惯，以达到改变粮食加工办法，增加食用粮食的目的。
    （五）各级人民政府，应根据上述各项办法，切实调查并研究当地粮食加工工厂、作坊、粮食商店的状况，规定限制碾精米、制精面和提倡吃标准米标准面的具体办法，并进行系统的组织工作。
