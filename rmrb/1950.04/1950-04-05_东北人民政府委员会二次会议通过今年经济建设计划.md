Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd -- The Second Meeting of the Northeast People's Government Committee was held from March 20th to 22nd. Thirty-three government committee members attended, and more than 250 people from various departments, institutes, bureaus, banks, and other military and civilian organizations of the Northeast People's Government attended as observers. The meeting heard and discussed Chairman Gao Gang's report on the restoration and reconstruction of the national economy in the Northeast. In the report, Chairman Gao first explained the importance of the Northeast's position in the national economy based on various figures, explaining why the people of the whole country are paying attention to the restoration and development of the Northeast's economy and the correct policy of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to build the Northeast into a national industrial base.

Last year, the total output value of state-owned industries in the Northeast exceeded the original plan by 4.2%. Prices have reached relative stability.

In his report, Chairman Gao Gang made a basic summary of the work of national economic recovery in 1949, pointing out that the total output value of the industrial department system for the whole year (of which the value of the means of production accounted for 74%) exceeded the original plan by 4.2%; agricultural production only reached a little over 90% of the planned output due to floods in the south and droughts in the north. The speed of increase in the production of state-owned industry and agriculture is extremely noteworthy, and the speed of recovery of industrial production exceeds the speed of recovery of industrial equipment, which especially illustrates the superiority of state-owned industry and shows the great prospect of our productivity that may rapidly develop. The industry and commerce of private capital have also developed due to the development of state-owned industry and agriculture, and the increase in people's purchasing power. For example, the number of private industrialists in Shenyang increased by 23%, and the number of workers they employed increased by 18%. The development of the Northeast's economy not only supported the army entering the customs and going south, but also began to improve the people's lives: in 1949 alone, the number of employees in state-owned industries increased by 240,000, the actual wages of workers and staff increased by an average of 27%, the state's expenditure on labor insurance and various welfare measures accounted for 9% to 11% of the total wage bill, the exchange ratio of grain and cloth changed the situation of cheap grain and expensive cloth, prices reached relative stability, the burden on farmers was also lighter than the previous year, and state-owned stores and cooperatives supplied consumers with essential necessities while purchasing various grains and local products, resulting in a relatively stable internal market and the beginning of improvement in people's lives. Chairman Gao Gang pointed out: Although this is only a beginning, it is indeed a preliminary good beginning.

In addition, Chairman Gao Gang made a brief summary of other government work last year, such as the establishment of people's representative conferences at all levels, culture, education, health, public security, and judicial work, pointing out that these works around the center of economic construction have been successful.

Chairman Gao Gang put forward the economic plan for 1950 in his report. According to this plan, the total output value of state-owned industries in 1950 will be equal to 193% of that in 1949, of which the production of means of production will account for 79% of the total; agricultural production requires an output of 18 million tons, equal to 137% of that in 1949. The realization of this plan will bring about new changes in the proportion of industry and agriculture, and the proportion of industry will increase from about 35% in 1949 to about 43%; the fiscal revenue and expenditure budget will be balanced, and 54% of the total expenditure will be used as investment in the restoration and development of the economy. In terms of commercial planning, the total retail sales of state-owned stores and cooperatives this year will account for 50% of the total social retail circulation, an increase of 16% compared with last year; the number of state-owned retail stores will increase to 1,500. In order to expand the variety of materials necessary for the people's supply, in addition to the planned expansion of state-owned light industry, the development of local state-owned light industry and private light industry must be encouraged.

Our economy is moving in a planned direction, and the best way to promote and strengthen planning is to promote the contract system.

After Chairman Gao Gang presented the basic figures of the Northeast's economic construction in 1950 to the meeting, he emphasized the following four important issues: First, regarding the issue of planning, he pointed out: Our economy is moving in a planned direction, and we must transform our economic plan into organized action and combine it with the mass production movement. At the same time, based on the practical experience of the past year, he believes that the best way to promote and strengthen planning is to promote the contract system. Second, regarding the issue of enterprise management, he emphasized the importance and interrelationship of establishing a responsibility system, democratizing management, and economic accounting. He said: With a responsibility system, it is convenient for us to effectively organize ourselves in enterprises, ensure the realization of our plans, and thereby improve the management system and management organization. The responsibility system and the democratization of management are mutually combined, not mutually conflicting. Our enterprise responsibility system is a responsibility system based on democracy, and the democratization of management is a democracy with a responsibility system. The main task of implementing the democratization of management at present is to do a good job in the factory management committee. The responsibility system and the democratization of management must serve the implementation of economic accounting and fight for the economic accounting system, that is, to fight for reducing costs, for saving, and for expanding our productivity. Third, regarding the new record movement, he pointed out: The new record movement is a broad mass movement to improve production. It has changed the face of our factories and mines, educated cadres, and also improved the workers themselves. In the future, the promotion of the new record movement must use the main attention to guide and encourage workers and technicians to give play to their creativity, improve operating methods, and improve technical conditions. At the same time, he pointed out that the errors and biases in the past movement, mainly focusing on quantity rather than quality, and the blindness in the movement, must be improved in the future. Fourth, regarding the issue of developing agricultural production, based on the four main forms of agricultural economy in the Northeast, he proposed the policies that the government should adopt. The individual economy of farmers must be protected and its enthusiasm must be given play. The labor mutual aid organizations and rural supply and marketing cooperatives must be led and specifically helped with great attention, but anyone who wants to participate in exchanging labor or working alone has complete freedom of choice and must not be forced. The key to developing labor mutual aid lies in the fact that participating in exchanging labor can truly produce more grain, and a united and educational attitude is adopted towards farmers working alone; the development of the rich peasant economy is allowed, not excluded, and it is not appropriate to adopt restrictive policies at present; state-owned farms should do more work in promoting excellent varieties, improving agricultural tools, and applying agricultural science in the future to guide and influence mass production.

Finally, Chairman Gao Gang said: After the plan is set, from possibility to reality, it will still take arduous struggle, and there are still many difficulties on the road ahead that need to be overcome. In this regard, he called on governments at all levels to unite as one, stand closely with the working class, farmers, technicians, and all intellectuals, work diligently and thriftily under the banner of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, study hard, correct shortcomings, and strive to complete the arduous and glorious task of 1950.

Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin, Northeast People's Government Committee member Ning Wu and more than a dozen others spoke successively, unanimously expressing their approval of Chairman Gao Gang's report, and unanimously expressing their determination to overcome difficulties from their respective positions and resolutely implement the 1950 plan. In their speeches, the committee members briefly reported on the work of their departments last year and made self-criticisms of the shortcomings in their work.

Vice Chairman Lin Feng finally spoke, saying: Chairman Gao Gang's report will have its role and influence in the history of Northeast development and in the history of national economic construction. His report summarized the work of 1949, indicating that the Northeast embodied the policies and guidelines instructed by Chairman Mao in the specific work. Due to the correct implementation of the transition from the countryside to the cities, the work in 1949 achieved great results and also received good feedback from the masses. In the words of the masses, it was "grain is expensive and goods are cheap, and public grain is light." Regarding the plan for 1950, he said: This was formulated under the direction of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, based on the policy direction decided by the Northeast People's Representative Conference, on the basis of the work last year, and based on the actual situation this year. Therefore, the work plan for 1950 should become a unified effort direction for people's governments at all levels.

After heated discussions, the meeting basically approved Chairman Gao Gang's report—the Northeast Economic Construction Plan for 1950, the Fiscal Budget for 1950, the draft personnel establishment, and the cooperative charter, and submitted them to the Central People's Government for final revision and approval before being promulgated and implemented.

Finally, Chairman Gao Gang made a summary for the meeting amidst warm applause. He called on everyone to rely on the people to overcome difficulties. He said: We must educate all cadres: In the past, we relied on the people to win the victory of the war. Today, we must rely on the people to win the achievements of economic construction. This is the decisive key to completing the plan for restoring and developing the national economy. In his concluding remarks, he said: "Planning is not equal to reality, and turning the plan into the reality of materials is an arduous task. We are responsible to the people, and the people have the right to check our work. To turn the plan into reality, we must organize and mobilize the power of the broad masses of people to invest in the actions of realizing the plan; we must strictly check in the process of realization, discover problems, and solve problems. I think as long as we all face production, earnestly and humbly study, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, closely unite the entire Northeast people, and use our hands, feet, and brains, we can overcome all difficulties, give play to great strength, and victoriously complete our Northeast people's construction plan."

　　东北人民政府委员会二次会议通过今年经济建设计划
    公营工业生产总值将等于去年之百分之一百九十三。工业的比重将增至百分之四十三。                            
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北人民政府委员会第二次会议于三月二十日至二十二日举行。出席政府委员三十三人，东北人民政府各部、院、局、行及其他军民机关团体列席者二百五十余人。会议听取和讨论了高岗主席关于东北国民经济恢复和重建问题的报告。在报告中，高主席首先根据各种数字说明东北在全国国民经济地位中的重要性，说明全国人民为什么均注视东北经济的恢复和发展及毛主席和中央人民政府决心要把东北建设为全国工业化基地的正确方针。
    去年东北公营工业生产总值超过原计划百分之四点二。物价达到了相对稳定。
    高岗主席在报告中对一九四九年国民经济恢复的工作作了基本总结，指出在工业部系统全年生产总值（其中生产手段所值占百分之七十四）超过原计划的百分之四点二；农业生产因南涝北旱，只达计划产量的百分之九十强。公营工业和农业生产提高的速度是极值得注意的，而工业生产量恢复的速度超过了工业设备恢复的速度，尤其说明公营工业的优越性，并表明了我们生产力可能迅速发展的伟大前途。私人资本的工商业，因公营工业和农业的发展，以及人民购买力之提高，也得到了发展，如沈阳私人工业家数增加了百分之二十三，其雇用工人数目增加了百分之十八。东北经济的发展，不但支援了入关南下的大军，而且已经开始改善了人民生活：一九四九年仅公营工业就业人数增加了二十四万人，职工实际工资平均提高百分之二十七，国家为劳动保险和各种福利措施支出合工资总数百分之九至十一，粮布的交换比价改变了粮贱布贵的状况，物价达到了相对稳定，农民负担也比前年减轻了，国家商店和合作社供给消费者主要必需品，同时购入各种粮食和土产，致使内部市场相对稳定，人民生活开始改善。高岗主席指出：这虽还只是一个开端，但确是初步良好的开端。
    此外，高岗主席对于去年政府其他工作如建立各级人民代表会议、文教卫生、公安司法等项工作均有扼要总结，指出这些工作围绕经济建设的中心都是有成绩的。
    高岗主席在报告中提出了一九五○年的经济计划。根据这个计划，一九五○年公营工业生产总值将等于一九四九年的百分之一百九十三，其中生产手段的生产将占总数的百分之七十九；农业生产要求产量达一千八百万吨，等于一九四九年的百分之一百三十七。这个计划之实现，将使工业和农业的比重发生新的变化，工业的比重将由一九四九年的百分之三十五左右增至百分之四十三左右；财政收支预算平衡，并将以全部支出的百分之五十四作为对恢复与发展经济的投资。商业方面的计划，今年国营商店和合作社零售总额将占社会零售流通总额的百分之五十，较去年增加百分之十六；国营零售商店增加到一千五百处，为扩大供给人民所必需的物资品种，除计划中预定扩大公营轻工业外，必须鼓励地方公营轻工业及私营轻工业的发展。
    我们的经济是朝着计划方向走，促进和加强计划性最好的办法是推广合同制。
    高岗主席向会议提出了一九五○年东北经济建设的基本数字后，着重说明了下面的四个重要问题：第一、关于计划的问题，他指出：我们的经济是朝着计划方向走，必须使我们的经济计划变为有组织的行动，和广大群众的生产运动结合起来。同时，他根据一年来的实际经验，认为促进和加强计划性的最好办法就是推广合同制。第二、关于企业管理问题，他着重说明了建立责任制、管理民主化和经济核算的重要性及其相互联系。他说：有了责任制，就便于我们在企业上有效地组织起来，保证我们计划的实现，并从而做到改进管理制度和管理组织。责任制与管理民主化是互相结合，而非互相冲突的。我们的企业责任制乃是在民主基础上的责任制，而管理民主化乃是有责任制的民主。实行管理民主化当前主要的工作是搞好工厂管理委员会。责任制与管理民主化，必须为贯彻经济核算而服务，为经济核算制而斗争，就是为减低成本、为节约而斗争，为扩大我们生产力而斗争。第三、关于新纪录运动，他指出：新纪录运动是一个广泛的群众性的提高生产的运动，它改变了我们厂矿的面貌，教育了干部，也改进了工人自己。今后推广新纪录运动必须用主要注意力去引导和鼓励工人们与技术人员们发挥自己的创造力，改进作业方法，改进技术条件。同时，他指出，过去运动中的错误和偏向，主要是重量不重质，运动中的盲目性，今后必须加以改进。第四、关于发展农业生产的问题，他根据目前东北农业经济四种主要形态，提出政府所应采取的政策，对于农民个体经济必须保护和发挥其积极性，对于劳动互助组织与农村供销合作社必须用很大注意力去领导与具体帮助，但谁愿参加变工或单干完全有选择自由，不得强迫。发展劳动互助关键在于参加变工真正能多打粮食，对于单干的农民并采取团结教育的态度；对于富农经济是允许其发展，而不是排斥，在目前也不宜采取限制政策；对于公营农场今后在推广优良品种、改良农具、运用农业科学上应多作些工作，以指导与影响群众的生产。
    最后，高岗主席说：计划订了之后，从可能到现实，还要经过艰苦奋斗，前进的道路上还有很多困难，要去克服。于此，他号召各级政府团结一致，和工人阶级、农民、技术人员及一切知识分子紧紧站在一起，在中国人民领袖毛主席的旗帜下，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，努力学习，纠正缺点，为完成一九五○年的艰巨又光荣的任务而奋斗。
    高崇民副主席、东北人民政府委员宁武等十数人相继发言，一致表示赞同高岗主席的报告，并一致表示决心各从自己岗位上克服困难，坚决贯彻一九五○年计划。各委员在发言中均简略报告了本部门去年的工作，及对工作中的缺点进行了自我批评。
    林枫副主席最后发言，他说：高岗主席的报告在东北发展的历史上以及全国经济建设史上，都将发生其作用和影响。他的报告总结了一九四九年的工作，说明东北在具体进行工作中是体现了毛主席所指示的方针和政策的。由于正确地贯彻了从乡村到城市的转变，一九四九年工作收到很大成果，也在群众中得到了好的反映，照群众的话说，就是“粮贵物贱公粮轻”。关于一九五○年的计划，他说：这是在毛主席和中央人民政府规定的方向下，根据东北人民代表会议决定的施政方针，在去年的工作基础上，依据今年的实际情况而制订的。因此，一九五○年的工作计划，应该变成各级人民政府统一的努力方针。
    会议经过热烈讨论后，对于高岗主席的报告——一九五○年的东北经济建设计划、一九五○年财政预算、人员编制草案、和合作社章程，均已作基本通过，交由东北人民政府作最后修正后呈请中央人民政府审查，经批准后即公布实行。
    最后，高岗主席在热烈的掌声中为会议作总结。他号召大家要依靠人民群众克服困难。他说：要教育一切干部：过去我们依靠人民赢得了战争胜利，今天我们要依靠人民赢得经济建设的成绩。这是完成恢复与发展国民经济计划的决定关键。他于结语中说：“计划不等于现实，把计划变成物资的现实，是艰巨的工作。我们对人民负责，人民有权利来检查我们的工作。要把计划变为现实，就要组织动员广大人民的力量，投入实现计划的行动；就要在实现过程中严格检查，发现问题、解决问题。我想只要我们大家面向生产，切实虚心学习，坚决执行毛主席的指示，紧紧地团结全东北人民，动手、动脚、动脑，就能克服一切困难，发挥出伟大力量，胜利完成我们东北人民的建设计划。”
