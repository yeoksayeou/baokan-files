    Shandong Province, Jinan County, Prevents and Treats Mass Edema
    [Our Newspaper] Since November of last year, Jinan County, Shandong Province, has successively discovered edema, with a large number of patients. The Shandong Provincial Government, the Lunan Administrative Office, and the local Special Commissioner's Office and County Government have organized medical personnel to go to the countryside for treatment. After diagnosis and testing, it was confirmed that the disease was caused by a lack of nutrition and did not require drug treatment. In order to subsidize the nutrition of the sick masses, the government has successively distributed 21,000 jin of black beans and a batch of cod liver oil. In addition to treating patients, the county is currently calling on all regions to do a good job in production for self-salvation, improve the lives of the masses, and fundamentally eliminate the disease.

　　山东省济北县防治群众水肿病
    【本报讯】山东省济北县自去年十一月起，陆续发现水肿病，患者甚多。山东省府、鲁中南行署、及当地专署、县政府等曾组织医务人员下乡疗治。经诊断检验，证实此病系缺乏营养所致，无需药物治疗。政府为补助患病群众营养，曾先后发下黑豆二万一千斤和鱼肝油一批。该县目前除一面治疗病人外，并号召各地作好生产自救，改善群众生活，从根本上消灭此病。
