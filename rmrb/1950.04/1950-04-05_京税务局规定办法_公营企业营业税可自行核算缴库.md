　　Beijing Tax Bureau Stipulates Measures:
    Public Enterprises Can Self-Assess and Pay Business Tax Directly into the Treasury

    [This newspaper reports] According to Article 8 of the "Provisional Measures for the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Tax by Public Enterprises" promulgated by the Government Administration Council on March 3, the Beijing Tax Bureau notified all public enterprises in Beijing on April 1st to declare their business turnover and pay the previous month's business tax to the tax bureau before the 7th of each month. Units such as the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China have already declared on time. The Municipal Tax Bureau has now stipulated that all public enterprises can, while declaring, self-assess the tax amount based on the declared business turnover according to the tax rate (plus one-tenth for local education and health expenses), and directly pay it into the treasury at the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China and its various offices before the deadline. If the assessment is incorrect, the Municipal Tax Bureau will notify them to make supplementary payments later. If there is intentional concealment with the intent to evade taxes, it will be punished according to regulations upon investigation by the tax bureau. This new regulation can ensure that tax payments are promptly deposited into the treasury. Moreover, public enterprises already have experience in paying industrial and commercial tax for 1949 and business tax for 1950, and are familiar with tax assessment methods and tax rates, so its implementation is not considered difficult. For example, when the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau paid its business tax for January and February of this year, it self-assessed the tax amount, issued a check for the amount, and after declaring it to the tax bureau, immediately obtained a payment voucher and went to the bank to pay the tax into the treasury.

　　京税务局规定办法
    公营企业营业税可自行核算缴库
    【本报讯】根据政务院三月三日颁布之公营企业缴纳工商业税暂行办法第八条，北京市税务局已于四月一日通知京市各公营企业于每月七日前向税局申报营业额缴纳上月营业税。刻已有人民银行北京分行等单位按时申报。市税务局兹又规定各公营企业可一面申报，一面根据所申报的营业额按税率自行核算（外加十分之一的地方教育卫生费），于限期前迳向人民银行北京分行及各办事处缴库；如核算错误，以后再由市税局通知补缴，如有意匿报企图逃税，经税局查出即照章处罚。此项新规定可以使税款及时纳库，而各公营企业已有缴纳一九四九年工商业税及一九五○年营业税的经验，对税款核算方法及税率都已熟悉，实行并不感困难。如北京电信局在缴纳今年一、二两月份营业税时，就自己核算出税额，按数开出支票，到税局申报后当时就拿到缴款书到银行缴税纳库。
