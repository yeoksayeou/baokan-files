A Good Way for the Government to Maintain Close Ties with the Masses
    Record of People's Representative Conferences in Various Districts of Guangzhou

    To enable the government to maintain broader and closer ties with the masses, and to mobilize the masses to assist the government in completing revolutionary construction work, Guangzhou, from the end of January to mid-March, has convened district people's representative conferences in 23 out of its 28 districts.

    Before the convening of representative conferences in various districts, some cadres thought that the masses had not been deeply mobilized, there were few cadres, the tasks were diverse and heavy, and the organization was not sound. Moreover, no such conferences had been held in cities across the country, so confidence was not high and a hesitant attitude was adopted. The districts then first convened cadre meetings to clarify their thinking, making cadres unanimously recognize that convening district people's representative conferences was a good way to help the government understand the situation and mobilize and organize the masses. At the same time, before the conference, symposiums or individual interviews were held with workers, shop assistants, various industries, and freelancers to solicit opinions from all walks of life on the representative conferences and to listen to their proposals on issues to be discussed. Preparatory committees were established. Some districts also posted slogans, published blackboard newspapers, and big-character posters, and convened mass meetings in the streets to publicize the significance of the people's representative conferences and the central issues to be resolved. The method of generating representatives: In areas or industries with a relatively solid foundation, democratic elections and government review and appointment were adopted; in general, government appointment was used. In terms of the proportion of representatives: generally, workers and shop assistants accounted for one-third, ensuring the leading and driving role of the working class. The focus of the conference discussions, based on the current demands of the masses, was on doing a good job in winter prevention, consolidating public security, and the most closely related to the vital interests of the masses, so the discussions were also the most heated, and the methods proposed were also the most specific. Proposals on this issue accounted for almost more than one-third in various districts. When discussing the issue of winter prevention, the Xichan District brought eight captured bandits to the meeting, publicly pointed out that bandits, special agents, and hooligans were a trinity, and exposed their criminal facts, requesting everyone to organize to cooperate with the government to consolidate local public security. After educating with examples, the awareness of the representatives attending the meeting and their enthusiasm for anti-espionage and anti-banditry were greatly improved.

    Several districts that convened people's representative conferences around the Spring Festival immediately absorbed representatives to participate in the three committees of public security, supporting the army and government, and promoting public bonds at the meeting. After the meeting, the representatives immediately brought the spirit of the conference to the masses. Due to their promotion, district street offices, resident groups, and mutual aid groups were generally organized, and the neighborhood patrol teams were improved and strengthened. The masses automatically reported crimes, which played a great role in winter prevention work, and robbery cases in various districts were greatly reduced. In Xichan District, before the representative conference was held, more than ten robbery cases occurred every month. After the conference, only one or two cases occurred, and they were quickly solved through mass reporting and assistance. Under the leadership of the representatives in Deji Street, Taiping District, the collection of 26 million yuan for troop support was completed in one and a half days. After the people's representative conferences, the district governments, which previously felt that they could not break the situation, now also felt that "after communicating with the masses, things are easier to handle."

　　政府密切联系群众的好方法
    记广州市各区各界代表会
    为使政府更广泛而密切的联系群众，发动群众协助政府完成革命建设工作，广州市于一月底开始迄三月中旬，在二十八个区中，已有二十三个区召开了区各界人民代表会议。
    在各区召开代表会前，某些干部思想上以为群众还未深入发动，干部少，任务多样而繁重，组织不健全。且全国各城市都没有开过这样会议，信心不高，采取了犹豫态度。各区乃先召开干部会议，打通思想，使干部一致认识召开区各界人民代表会议，正是帮助政府了解情况，发动与组织群众的良好办法。同时，在会前曾召开工人、店员、各行业、自由职业等座谈会或个别访问，征询各界对代表会议的意见和倾听他们对讨论问题的提案，并成立了筹备会。某些区更张贴标语、出黑板报、大字报、召开街的群众大会，宣传各界代表会议的意义和准备解决的中心问题。代表产生办法：工作较有基础地区或行业，采取民主选举、政府审查聘定；一般的采用政府聘请。在代表成份比重上：一般的做到工人、店员代表占三分之一，保证了工人阶级的带头、推动作用。会议讨论中心，根据当前群众要求出发，以搞好冬防，巩固治安，与群众切身利益最密切，因此讨论也最热烈，提出的办法也最具体。各区有关此问题的提案几乎普遍占三分之一以上。西禅区则在讨论冬防问题时，将捕获之八个匪徒带到会上来，当众指出土匪、特务、流氓是三位一体的，并揭露其罪恶事实，要求大家组织起来协同政府巩固地方治安，以实例作教育后，大大提高了到会代表的认识和反特防匪的积极性。
    在春节前后召开各界代表会议的几个区，在会上即吸收代表们参加了治安、拥军拥政、推销公债等三个委员会，会后代表们即将会议精神带到群众中。由于他们的推动，区街办事处、居民小组、互助小组普遍组织起来，并健全和加强了街坊纠察队，群众自动告密，对冬防工作起了很大作用，各区抢案大大减少。西禅区在未开代表会议前，每月有十余件抢案发生，会后，只发生了一两件，也经群众告密和协助而很快破案。太平区德济街由于代表们带头推动下，一天半功夫即超额完成二千六百万元劳军款的筹集。经过各界代表会议后，过去觉得没法打开局面的区政府，现在也感到“与群众通了气，事情也好办了”。
