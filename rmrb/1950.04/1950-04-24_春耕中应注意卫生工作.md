　　Attention to Hygiene Work During Spring Plowing
    Since the beginning of spring, infectious diseases have been discovered in some areas. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Health Department of the Military Commission issued "Instructions to People's Governments and Troops at All Levels Regarding Launching Spring Epidemic Prevention Work for the Military and Civilians" as early as February 10th. The instructions require People's Governments at all levels, all troops, all people's organizations, and even Chinese and Western doctors and other health workers to regard spring epidemic prevention work as one of the current urgent tasks.
    According to the epidemic prevention work in the Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province, as reported in today's newspaper, many local governments have attached importance to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Health and the Health Department of the Military Commission, paid attention to hygiene and epidemic prevention work, were able to quickly report epidemics, promptly organize prevention and treatment, and were able to discover problems and solve problems in their work. This is a concrete manifestation of the People's Government being responsible to the people. However, some local government personnel still ignore the instructions of their superiors and despise hygiene and epidemic prevention work. When they discover epidemics, they neither actively organize prevention and treatment nor report to their superiors. Even people like the township head of Xiaogao Township and the village head of Ningdu Village in Wuzhi County falsely report the epidemic and conceal the epidemic. This is a serious manifestation of irresponsibility! This is likely to cause undue losses to the masses, and we should resolutely oppose it!
    Now that the weather is getting warmer and spring plowing is in full swing in various places, the possibility of infectious diseases spreading has also increased. In order to protect the health of farmers, all localities should pay attention to epidemic prevention work and must not allow epidemics to undermine our production tasks.

### 春耕中应注意卫生工作

　　春耕中应注意卫生工作
    入春以来，个别地区已发现传染病。中央人民政府卫生部、军委卫生部早在二月十日发出的“关于开展军民春季防疫工作给各级人民政府及部队的指示”要求各级人民政府、各部队、各人民团体以至各地中、西医师们和其他卫生工作者应把春季防疫工作看作当前紧急任务之一。
    根据本报今日发表的平原省新乡专区防疫工作的情况看来，许多地方政府已重视中央卫生部与军委卫生部的这一指示，注意了卫生防疫工作，能迅速地报告疫情，及时组织防治，并能在工作中发现问题，解决问题，这是人民政府对人民负责的具体表现之一。可是，部分地方政府人员仍忽视上级的指示，轻视卫生防疫工作，他们发现疫病既不积极组织防治，又不向上级报告。甚至像武陟县小高镇镇长与宁都村村长那种人，还假报疫情、掩饰疫情。这是严重的不负责的表现！这很可能给群众造成不应有的损失，我们应该坚决反对！
    现在天气日暖，各地正在紧张地进行春耕，而传染病流行的可能性也加大了，为保护农民健康，各地对于防疫工作应加以注意，决不能让疫病来破坏我们的生产任务。
