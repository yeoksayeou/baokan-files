　　Yao Cixiang Neglects Human Life
　　Gao Zhentian, a stoker from the Kailuan Zhaokuang Train Depot, suddenly fell ill at 10:25 PM on March 25th, suffering from chest pains and diarrhea. His fellow workers immediately carried him to the hospital. Upon arrival, the nurse took his pulse and temperature, discovering his temperature and pulse were weak, and his face was pale. The nurse was at a loss and reported the details to Dr. Yao Cixiang by telephone at 10:40 PM. Dr. Yao instructed the nurse to administer a cardiac stimulant, but it proved ineffective. The nurse then telephoned the doctor a second time. The doctor instructed her to ask Linxi for a car for transfer. The nurse complied, but the patient's condition gradually worsened before the car arrived. The nurse telephoned Dr. Yao a third time, but Dr. Yao remained at home. Ten minutes later, seeing that the doctor had not arrived, the nurse called the doctor a fourth time, finally prompting Dr. Yao to leave. Unfortunately, the patient stopped breathing at 11:30 PM; at this time, the Linxi car had arrived. Dr. Yao arrived ten minutes after the Linxi car (it would have taken a maximum of fifteen minutes for the doctor to arrive at the hospital after being notified, including dressing and travel time).
　　Dr. Yao Cixiang has served at Zhaokuang for over ten years and has consistently displayed a bureaucratic style. Not only does he fail to care properly for sick workers, but he also glares at them; after liberation, he continues to treat workers' lives as a game. Once, worker Li Xingwu from the riveting factory was hammering when iron slag splashed into his eye. Dr. Yao treated it carelessly, resulting in Comrade Li Xingwu suffering over ten days of pain, finally being cured at Linxi Hospital, narrowly avoiding blindness. Worker Feng Guoxing from the transportation department was injured in the back of the neck by the iron gate of a coal car. When he sought treatment, Dr. Yao did not conduct a detailed examination, casually applying some medicine, causing Comrade Feng Guoxing to endure pain for over twenty days. Unable to bear it any longer, he went to Linxi for an X-ray, which revealed that half of the bone in the back of his neck was broken. Similar situations are countless. This bureaucratic style that neglects the health and lives of workers must be thoroughly reflected upon. To ensure the health care of the over ten thousand workers at Zhaokuang, we request that Kailuan Hospital take this matter seriously and replace Dr. Yao with a suitable doctor to handle the medical work at Zhaokuang Hospital.

　　姚慈祥玩忽人命
    开滦赵矿火车房司炉高振田同志，在三月二十五日夜十时二十五分突患急病，胸疼下泻，当即由工友们背至医院。到医院后，护士对病人诊脉、试表，发现他的体温与脉搏微弱，并且脸色发青。护士束手无策，于十点四十分用电话将详情报告姚慈祥大夫。姚大夫指示给注射强心剂，但注射后仍无效。护士又二次电知大夫。大夫指示向林西要汽车转送。护士照办，但在汽车没来前，病人已经逐渐严重。护士又三次电知姚大夫，姚大夫仍在家里没动，隔十分后护士见大夫没来，又进行四次电话催大夫，姚大夫才动身。不幸病人于十一点三十分，呼吸断绝；此时林西汽车已到。姚大夫在林西汽车到后十分钟才赶来（按大夫若得通知后及时来医院，连穿衣行路包括在内最多十五分钟）。
    姚慈祥大夫服务于赵矿十余年，一贯是官僚作风。他对患病工人不仅不好好照顾；反而横眉瞪眼；解放后仍拿工人生命当儿戏。一次铆工厂工人李兴武同志抡铁锤，把铁渣溅到眼里，姚大夫马虎从事，结果使李兴武同志受十余天的痛苦，在林西医院才治好，险些失明。运输处工友冯国兴被煤车铁门将脖子后骨拍伤，找他诊疗，他又不详加检查，随便涂上点药，使冯国兴同志忍痛二十余天，实在不能支持，到林西透视才发现脖子后骨已断一半。类似此种情形，数不胜数。这种玩忽工人生命健康的官僚作风必须彻底反省。为了顾全赵矿一万多工友的保健工作，我们要求开滦医院重视这件事，更换适当的大夫担任赵矿医院的医务工作。
