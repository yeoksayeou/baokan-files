    Suspicious Dealings of American Adventurers
    Nikolia Gortsev
    (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 14th) The Pravda published on the front page on the 13th a special article titled "Suspicious Dealings of American Adventurers," commenting on the recent intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into the southern region of Libau on the Soviet border.
    The author of the article, Nikolia Gortsev, after recounting the incidents of Soviet border violations, wrote: The fact that a U.S. military aircraft appeared over Soviet territory not only constitutes a rude violation of the Soviet border, but also an unprecedented violation of the basic principles of international law. Among the international laws and treaties and customs that have been considered sacred for centuries, no provision is more indisputable than the one stipulating that national borders are inviolable and that no one may cross the border without the consent of the country. Violating this provision is nothing but a deliberate infringement of another country's national sovereignty and international law.
    Soviet aircraft guarding the Soviet frontier have given a deserved rebuff to the rude actions of the American reconnaissance aircraft. The intruder received a deserved lesson and was forced to retreat. The Soviet government's firm protest to the U.S. government against this rude violation of the Soviet border by a U.S. military aircraft rightfully describes these actions of American adventurers as an unheard-of violation of the basic principles stipulated by international law.
    Now, the U.S. authorities are trying to cover their tracks. For example, the U.S. Air Force representative stationed in Wiesbaden asserted on April 11th that a U.S. aircraft was reported missing after a routine training flight over northern Germany and Denmark. However, he remained silent about the so-called "training" of this aircraft intruding into the Soviet border and carrying out its mission in Soviet airspace.
    The U.S. ruling clique is trying to complicate the issue in various ways, pointing out that this so-called "accident" occurred in Latvian airspace, which the U.S. does not recognize as Soviet territory. They attempt to conceal their rude reconnaissance acts by this means. However, this absurd statement only confirms that the U.S. government disregards international public law in a brazen and shameless manner. American adventurers believe they can do whatever they want, and as the U.S. Air Force representative in Wiesbaden did, openly say, "If we need to, we can fly over the Baltic Sea."
    Facts refute this foolish arrogance. Facts compel respect for international law, as the incident involving the U.S. B-29 four-engine military aircraft south of Libau on April 8th illustrates.
    It should be absolutely clear that any futile talk about whether the U.S. government recognizes or does not recognize the Baltic Soviet Republics and the Soviet borders cannot cover up the illegal actions of the U.S. military aircraft that arrogantly intruded into Soviet airspace. The current U.S. rulers are attempting to use the claim that they do not recognize the Soviet Baltic border to conceal their illegal actions. This attempt is neither original nor new. The Hitler gang once made the same attempt, but also suffered the same misfortune. For example, Baukhoff, one of the notorious writers of the Hitler organization's publication, the *National Socialist Monthly*, even asserted that the entire Soviet Union could not be recognized as a subject of international law in order to justify the fascist anti-Soviet policy. American adventurers, having learned the fascist ideas of Hitler's diplomats almost entirely, are following the same path.
    However, there is no need to discuss this topic in further detail. It is enough to ask the U.S. government: if a Soviet military aircraft appeared in U.S. airspace, and, moreover, opened fire on a U.S. aircraft, what would the U.S. government say? It is appropriate to remind the U.S. ruling clique that even in the last century, the famous U.S. Senator and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Charles Sumner, explained some basic rules in international relations to the U.S. Senate. In his speech in the U.S. Senate in March 1871, he pointed out that Americans should not infringe on other countries, but they would not allow others to infringe on them either.
    There is another important aspect to this issue, namely that the U.S. government has seriously violated the sovereignty of Denmark. Newspaper reports show that the U.S. aircraft landed in Denmark without any prior permission and even without any notification to the Danish authorities. The U.S. Command occupied the Kastrup Airport in Denmark. Copenhagen newspapers reported that dozens of aircraft have been parked at the airport, and U.S. aircraft are continuing to arrive. According to the Swedish Telegraph Agency, there are widespread rumors in Sweden that the Americans are "testing the possibility of occupying the country under the pretext of peace." More accurately, they have already occupied the country in order to, as they insist, "search" for their aircraft.
    The actions of the U.S. military authorities are the most brazen.
    Gortsev mentioned Swedish newspaper reports about the surprise at the U.S. aircraft flying over the Swedish Karlskrona naval base. He wrote: The Swedish public recognizes the fact that the U.S. government is trying to exploit the situation to concentrate the U.S. Air Force in the Baltic Sea in order to exert pressure on the Swedes. It is no accident that the Scandinavian press continues to focus on the intensified activities of the U.S. Air Force in the Baltic region.
    Gortsev concluded: American adventurers are running rampant. The United States is implementing its "total" diplomatic policy, embarking on a new round of adventures to dominate the world, and using all means to achieve this goal. However, without a doubt, this adventurous policy is inevitably doomed to failure, just as it has been in the past.

    美国冒险家可疑的勾当
    尼可拉·哥尔捷也夫
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十三日以首页地位刊载题为《美国冒险家可疑的勾当》的专文，评论美军用机一架最近侵入苏联边境利巴雅南部一事。
    该文作者尼可拉·哥尔捷也夫在追述苏联边境受到侵犯的情况以后写道：美国军用机出现于苏联领土上空这一事实，不仅构成了对于苏联边境的无礼侵犯，并且也构成了对于国际法基本原则的空前违犯。在数百年来被认为是神圣的国际法和国际条约与惯例中，没有别的条款比规定国境不容侵犯，未经该国同意，任何人不得越境的这一条款更加无可置辩的了。违背这一规定不是别的，只是蓄意侵犯他国的国家主权与国际法。
    警卫苏联边疆的苏联飞机，已给予美国侦察机的粗鲁举动以应得的还击。犯境者得到了应得的教训，而被迫退却了。苏联政府向美国政府坚决抗议美国军用机这一无礼侵犯苏联边境的行为，正当地把美国冒险家这些行动形容为对于国际法所规定的基本原则的闻所未闻的违犯。
    现在，美国当局正在试图掩盖他们的形迹。例如，驻威斯巴登的美国空军代表，就在四月十一日一口咬定说：美国飞机在德国北部及丹麦上空作例行教练飞行后，据悉已告失踪。然而，他却对这架飞机侵入苏联边疆进行其在苏联领空的所谓“教练”闭口不谈。
    美国统治集团多方设法使问题复杂化，他们指出这次所谓“事故”是在美国不承认为苏联领土的拉脱维亚领空发生的，他们企图以此掩饰其进行侦察的粗鲁行径。但是，这个荒谬的言论，只不过证实美国政府把国际公法蛮横无礼地而又无耻地置若罔闻而已。美国的冒险家们认为，他们可以随心所欲，像美国驻威斯巴登的空军代表所作的那样，公然说什么“如果我们需要的话，我们就可以飞临波罗的海上空”。
    事实驳斥了这种愚蠢的自高自大。事实迫人尊重国际法，美国Ｂ——二十九式四引擎军用机四月八日在利巴雅南部所发生的事件，就说明了这一点。
    应该绝对弄明白这一点：任何关于美国政府承认或不承认波罗的海各苏维埃共和国和苏联边疆的无谓之谈，都不能掩盖住骄横无礼地侵入苏联领空的美国军用机的非法行动。目前的美国统治者，企图以说什么他们不承认苏联波罗的海边疆来掩饰他们的非法行动，这种企图既不是独创一格，也不是什么新的东西。希特勒匪帮就曾一度作过同样的企图，可是，也曾遭到了同样的恶运。譬如，希特勒机关刊《国社党月刊》的臭名远扬的撰稿人之一鲍克霍甫，他为了替法西斯对苏政策进行诡辩，甚至断言整个苏联不能被承认为国际法上的主体。美国的冒险家在可以说已全盘学会了希特勒外交家的法西斯思想后，就这样来遵循着同样的道路。
    可是，没有必要再加详细讨论这个题目了。只要这样问一问美国政府就够了：如果苏联军用机出现在美国领空，并且，不但如此，它还向美国飞机开火，那么，美国政府将会说什么呢？在这里提醒一下美国统治集团是恰当的，这就是甚至在上一世纪，著名的美国参议员和参院外交委员会主席查利·苏末尔，就曾对美国参议员讲解了国际关系中的某些基本规则。一八七一年三月，他在美国参院发表的演说中指出：美国人不应侵害其他国家，可是，他们也不容许别人来侵害他们。
    这一问题还有另外一个重要的方面，那就是，美国政府严重地侵犯了丹麦的主权。报纸的消息显示：美国飞机在丹麦着陆了，事先不仅没有得到任何准许，而且甚至也没有给丹麦当局以任何通知。美国司令部占领了丹麦的加斯特鲁普飞机场。哥本哈根的报纸报道：已经有好几十架飞机停在该飞机场，而美国飞机还正在继续飞来。据瑞典电报通讯社称：瑞典盛传美国人正在“和平的借口下试验占领该国的可能性”。更正确的说法是，为了像他们所硬说的要“搜寻”他们的飞机，他们已经占领了这个国家。
    美国军事当局的行动，是最厚颜无耻的。
    哥尔捷也夫提到瑞典报纸关于美国飞机飞越瑞典卡尔斯克罗那海军基地的惊讶的报道。他写道：瑞典公众认识到这种事实，即美国政府企图利用环境，集中美国在波罗的海的空军，来对瑞典人施以压力。斯堪的纳维亚的报界之继续集中注意于美国空军加紧在波罗的海地区活动一事上，这并不是偶然的。
    哥尔捷也夫结语称：美国的冒险家正在放肆横行。美国正在实行其“总体”外交政策，开始从事于称霸世界的花样翻新的冒险，并不择手段，以求达此目的。然而，毫无疑义，这一次正如过去一样，这种冒险政策是必然要遭受失败的。
