Conspiracy to Use Western European People as Cannon Fodder
    War Profiteers Gather in The Hague

    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch] Under the auspices of the American reactionaries, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has recently been holding a series of military conferences in The Hague and London.

    The meetings held so far include the second meeting of the Military Production and Supply Bureau on March 24, chaired by Howard, director of the U.S. Munitions Board; the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Military Committee on March 25, chaired by Lieutenant General Crittenberger, deputy to General Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the second meeting of the Military Committee on March 28, chaired by Bradley himself. The third meeting of the so-called "Defense Committee," which will open on April 1, will be chaired by U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson. Johnson flew from Washington to The Hague on the 29th. In addition to the chiefs of staff (attending the Military Committee) and defense ministers (attending the Defense Committee) of the North Atlantic Group countries, 250 military experts from various countries are also participating in the above meetings.

    The main purpose of the series of meetings convened by the American reactionaries is to further concretize the aggression plan of the North Atlantic Group when the so-called "military aid materials" worth 1 billion US dollars are shipped from the United States to Europe. According to a communiqué issued after the meeting of the Military Committee, the meeting has adopted a "comprehensive defense plan for the North Atlantic region that coordinates the local plans drafted by the five regional groups" under the North Atlantic Group. This so-called comprehensive defense plan stipulates the division of labor among the countries within the aggressive bloc when launching a war. According to a report from The Hague on the 28th by the United Press International, citing well-informed sources, this division of labor will be: the United States will assume the role of strategic bombing and supply, becoming the "arsenal" of the North Atlantic; other countries will be responsible for offensive tasks in the sea, land, and air forces; and "France and other participating countries on the continent" must "supply the immediately needed troops" to fight alone "before the full mobilization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization crosses the sea." In this way, the cruel conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to use the people of Western Europe as cannon fodder for its aggressive war has been further concretized. In addition, the plan also stipulates close cooperation among the contracting countries in terms of manpower and material resources, thereby enabling the United States to further strengthen its control over its vassal states. This plan will be submitted to the "Defense Committee" of the North Atlantic Group for approval.

    The so-called North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense, Finance and Economic Committee also held a meeting in London on the 29th under the chairmanship of U.S. representative Harriman, the European administrator of the Marshall Plan, to discuss the financial supply issues of the above-mentioned war plan, and its conclusions will also be submitted to the "Defense Committee" for review.

　　阴谋用西欧人民作炮灰
    战贩集会海牙
    【新华社三十一日讯】在美国反动派的主持之下，北大西洋侵略集团最近正在海牙与伦敦陆续举行一连串的军事会议。
    迄今为止，已举行过的会议，计有三月二十四日的军事生产供应局第二次会议，由美国军火局局长荷华德主持；三月二十五日的军事委员会常务委员会会议，由美国联合参谋长会议主席布莱德雷的副手克里腾堡格主持；三月二十八日的军事委员会第二次会议，由布莱德雷亲自主持。尚待举行的还有四月一日开幕的所谓“防务委员会”的第三次会议，将由美国国防部长詹逊主持。詹逊已于二十九日自华盛顿飞抵海牙。参加上述会议的，除北大西洋集团各国参谋总长（出席军事委员会）与国防部长（出席防务委员会）外，尚有各国军事专家二百五十人。
    美国反动派召集这一连串会议的主要目的，是企图在十亿美元的所谓“军援物资”自美启运赴欧之时，使北大西洋集团的侵略计划进一步具体化。据军事委员会会后发表的公报称，会议已通过了在北大西洋集团之下，“使五个区域集团草拟的地方性计划互相配合的北大西洋地区的全面防御计划”，这个所谓全面防御计划，却规定了侵略集团内各国在发动战争时的分工。据合众社海牙二十八日电引消息灵通人士透露称：这种分工将为：美国担负战略轰炸与供应任务的角色，成为北大西洋的“军火库”，其他国家则分别担任在海陆空军方面的攻击任务，而“法国及其他大陆上的参加国家”，并须“在北大西洋公约缔约国全部动员渡海以前，供应立即所需的军队”单独作战。这样，美帝国主义拿西欧人民作为它的侵略战争炮灰的残忍阴谋，已进一步具体化。此外，这个计划又规定各缔约国在人力、物力方面的密切配合，从而使美国得以进一步加强其对仆从国家的控制。这一计划将提交北大西洋集团的“防务委员会”批准。
    所谓北大西洋公约防务财政及经济委员会，亦已于二十九日在美国代表、马歇尔计划欧洲执行人哈里曼主持之下在伦敦举行会议，讨论了上述战争计划的财政供应问题，其结论亦将送交“防务委员会”审核。
