Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th. The Central Disaster Relief Committee's inspection team for the disaster areas of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu received a warm welcome from the disaster victims upon their arrival in Liugou Village, Bailong District, Laiyang County, Shandong. After arriving in Liugou Village on the 27th of last month, the masses eagerly spread the word: "Chairman Mao has sent people! This is truly the greatest joyous event since ancient times." An old woman leaning on a cane happily said, "I want to see the people who have come from Chairman Mao." That evening, the inspection team participated in the village's spring planting preparation meeting, listened to the situation, and provided specific guidance. In the past few days, the team members have gone deep into each household to investigate and offer condolences, and have specifically helped disaster victims formulate production and famine relief plans, visiting farmers in the fields during the day. The villagers were deeply moved and unanimously expressed their determination to guarantee the successful completion of sowing, strive to increase grain production by ten percent, overcome the famine, and ease Chairman Mao's concerns.

　　灾区视察组到达柳沟村
    灾民保证胜利完成播种  争取多打粮食战胜灾荒
    【新华社济南十一日电】中央救灾委员会山东、苏北灾区视察组到达山东莱东县白龙区柳沟村时，受到灾民的热烈欢迎。视察组于上月二十七日到达柳沟村后，群众争相传告：“毛主席派人来了，真是从古以来没有的大喜事。”一个老太婆拄着拐棍高兴地说：“我看看从毛主席那里来的人。”当晚，视察组便参加了该村准备春种会议，听取情况，并予以具体指导。几日来该组人员深入到各户调查慰问，并具体帮助灾民订制生产渡荒计划，白天又随同农民下泊访问。全村农民深受感动，一致表示坚决保证胜利完成播种，争取多打一成粮，战胜灾荒，好让毛主席不挂心。
