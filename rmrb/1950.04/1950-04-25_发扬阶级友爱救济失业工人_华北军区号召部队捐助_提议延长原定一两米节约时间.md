　　Promote Class Fraternity, Relieve Unemployed Workers
    North China Military Region Calls on Troops to Donate
    Proposes Extending Original One-to-Two-Rice-Grain Savings Period
    Directly Subordinate Organs of the North China Bureau of the CPC Donate More Than Four Million Yuan
    [Our Newspaper] Following the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' call to relieve unemployed workers, the North China Military Region immediately called on the entire army to promote class fraternity, save and donate to relieve unemployed workers. The call pointed out that in Shanghai, due to enemy blockade and bombing, and because land reform has not yet been carried out in the new areas, farmers' purchasing power is weak, and the industrial and commercial enterprises that previously relied on inflationary speculation have collapsed due to price stability, the number of unemployed workers has temporarily increased, and their lives are extremely difficult. Several large cities also have similar situations. The People's Liberation Army is extremely sympathetic and concerned about the difficulties encountered by the working masses during this transitional period from war victory to the construction of a new China and should provide assistance. The call proposed extending the original one-to-two-rice-grain savings period and donating the savings to unemployed workers. Doing so will not only enhance the close unity between the People's Liberation Army and the working class brothers but also be an extremely practical and important class education for the troops. This call from the North China Military Region is currently under heated discussion in various units.
    [Our Newspaper] In order to support unemployed workers in Shanghai and other places, the directly subordinate organs of the North China Bureau of the CPC launched enthusiastic donations. On April 22, the General Branch of the organs called for "promoting class fraternity and the spirit of unity and mutual assistance," and the comrades responded unanimously. Although they are on a supply system, all personnel actively donated. On the same day, they handed in all their donations, totaling more than 4,267,000 yuan. Some generously donated 100 or 70 catties of millet, while others had no money on hand and borrowed next month's allowance to donate. (Bing Ye)

　　发扬阶级友爱救济失业工人
    华北军区号召部队捐助
    提议延长原定一两米节约时间
    中共中央华北局直属机关捐款四百余万
    【本报讯】在全国总工会发出救济失业工人号召后，华北军区即号召全军发扬阶级友爱，节约捐输救济失业工人。号召中指出，上海由于敌人封锁轰炸和新区尚未进行土地改革，农民购买力低弱，加以过去靠通货膨胀投机的工商业因物价稳定而垮台，失业工人一时增多，其生活极为困难，若干大城市亦有类似情况。人民解放军对于工人群众在此由战争胜利转向新中国建设的过渡时期所遭遇的困难，异常同情关切，应给以援助。号召中提议，延长原定一两米节约时间，以节约所得，捐助失业工人。这样做，不仅足以增进人民解放军与工人阶级弟兄的亲密团结，并对于部队是一个极其实际的重要的阶级教育。华北军区这号召，正在各部队热烈讨论中。
    【本报讯】为支援上海及各地失业工人，中共中央华北局直属机关展开热烈捐献。四月二十二日机关总支号召“发扬阶级友爱与团结互助精神”，同志们一致响应；他们虽属供给制待遇，但所有人员莫不踊跃捐献，当天即交齐全部捐款，达四百二十六万七千余元。其中有慨捐小米百斤或七十斤者，有手边无钱而预借下月津贴费捐献者。（并野）
