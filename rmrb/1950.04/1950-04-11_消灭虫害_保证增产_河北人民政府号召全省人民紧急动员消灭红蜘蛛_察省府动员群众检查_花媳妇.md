Eliminate Pests, Guarantee Increased Production
    Hebei People's Government Calls on the People of the Province to Mobilize Urgently to Eliminate Red Spiders
    Chahar Provincial Government Mobilizes the Masses to Inspect "Painted Ladybugs"
    [Report from this newspaper] The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued an emergency call on April 4th regarding the "eradication of red spiders." It first pointed out that red spiders have now occurred in forty-seven counties throughout the province, and if this pest is not eliminated, it will lead to a serious reduction in wheat production. Therefore, eradicating red spiders and protecting wheat seedlings is the current urgent task of Party and government personnel and all the people in these areas! All localities should immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of wheat fields, and once discovered, quickly organize the masses to carry out repeated treatments to ensure that where they occur, they are eliminated, preventing them from spreading and causing disaster. Regarding treatment methods, it was pointed out that we must be good at discovering local people's pest control methods, and if they are effective, they should be immediately promoted. Through the leading role of model workers and production activists, a mass upsurge in pest extermination should be created. It was also pointed out that in the pest control movement, a system of responsibility at each level should be established, with clear rewards and punishments. Finally, it was pointed out that all localities should emulate the spirit of Zhengzhuang Village cadres in Anping County leading the masses to create pest control methods to eradicate pests, and the emergency measures taken by the Dingxian Special District Office in dispatching more than 400 cadres, led by responsible comrades from the special district, to various counties to lead pest control efforts.
    The Chahar Provincial People's Government also issued a notice on March 28th, "Mobilizing the Masses for Strict Inspection of Pests and Thorough Eradication." The notice pointed out that painted ladybugs and leaf beetles have now been found in Chongli, Wanquan, Huai'an, Hunyuan and other places. In all other areas of the province where painted ladybugs and leaf beetle infestations have occurred, they are bound to reoccur this year. In order to prevent and control them as early as possible, cadres at all levels and the vast number of farmers must promptly and strictly inspect for pests and quickly and thoroughly eliminate them.
