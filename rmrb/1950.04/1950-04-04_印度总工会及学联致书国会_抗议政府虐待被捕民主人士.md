　　Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 3rd: The Indian government's suppression of democrats is increasing daily. Arrests are being carried out nationwide, and prisons are overcrowded. In Amritsar, police used tear gas against demonstrating workers and arrested 52 people. In Ahmadnagar, approximately 200 people were arrested. In Adawa, 60 people were arrested. In the Cuttack jail in Orissa, 56 political prisoners began a hunger strike on March 18th, and many are in critical condition. The hunger strike of political prisoners in Delhi Jail has also reached 20 days.
　　The Delhi Committee of the All-India Trade Union Congress and the Delhi branch of the All-India Student Federation recently sent an open letter to members of the Indian Parliament protesting the authorities' crimes of persecuting political prisoners. The letter emphasized that the Indian people will never forget the authorities' beatings, poisoning, and shootings of defenseless prisoners in jails in Calcutta, Nashik, Sabarmati, Vellore, and Salem. The letter protested that political prisoners in Delhi Jail are being detained there without trial or interrogation. Some of those detained are released after their condition has deteriorated to the point of almost no hope, but many political prisoners are still being held in prison even when they are on the verge of death. Among these are Narayan, chairman of the Delhi Provincial Trade Union Congress, Nand, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, La Shande, a member of the Trade Union Congress, Ge Puda, general secretary of the All-India Postal Workers' Union, and others. The letter protested that those who sell themselves to Anglo-American imperialists and British agents can escape the bloody punishments inflicted on unprotected political prisoners. The letter declared: "We demand the release of political prisoners! They should not die!"

    抗议政府虐待被捕民主人士
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社德里二日电：印度政府对民主分子的镇压，日益增加。全国都在进行逮捕，各监狱已有人满之患。在阿姆利则，警察对示威工人施放催泪瓦斯弹，并逮捕了五十二人。在阿马德那加，约有二百人被捕。在阿达瓦，有六十人被捕。在奥里萨的卡塔克监狱中，有五十六名政治犯于三月十八日起开始绝食，很多绝食者已处于危急的状态中。德里监狱中政治犯的绝食，亦已达二十天。
    全印总工会的德里委员会和全印学生联合会的德里分会，最近为此曾以公开信件送交印度国会的议员，抗议当局迫害政治犯的罪行。该信着重指出，印度人民将永远不会忘记当局在加尔各答、纳西克、萨巴玛蒂、维洛尔和撒冷等地监狱，对手无寸铁的囚犯们的殴打、毒害和枪杀。该信抗议德里监狱中的政治犯未经审判和侦讯，就被拘禁在那里。有些被拘禁的人在他们的情况已经恶化得几乎没有希望以后，才获得释放，但是也有很多政治犯，虽然已到了死亡的边沿，却仍旧被关在狱中。这些人中有德里省的总工会主席纳拉扬、总工会的总书记南德、总工会会员拉善德、全印邮务工人工会的总书记葛浦达和其他等人。该信抗议那些卖身投靠英美帝国主义者和英国代理人的人们，反而可以免除那些毫无保护的政治犯所遭到的血腥刑罚。该信宣称：“我们要求释放政治犯！他们不应该死！”
