In Ding County Special District, Hebei Province, members of the Communist Youth League in various localities have played an active leading role in this year's spring plowing preparations, promoting the masses. There are nearly 30,000 League members in the entire special district. During the Spring Festival celebrations in February, many League members took advantage of the holidays to mobilize their parents to make annual production plans. For example, in the 32 League branches in the 12th district of Ding County, 500 League members held family meetings during the Spring Festival to make annual production and planting plans. Some League members used accounting to explain the benefits of planting cotton, persuading their parents to plant more cotton in response to the government's call to increase the planting of industrial raw materials. In the 12 League branches in Xinle County, 72 League members not only helped their own families make production plans but also helped 12 households of the masses formulate family production plans. In carrying out household planning, many League members took the initiative to discuss with the masses, proposing joint ventures to purchase agricultural tools, increase digging and repair of wells, and purchase waterwheels, adding strength to this year's great production.

As soon as the Spring Festival was over, while ordinary women were still wearing red flowers and new clothes, many young men and women League members started building pigsties, turning manure, delivering manure, and accumulating fertilizer at home. According to statistics from five League branches, such as Xihe in the sixth district of Lixian County, at the end of February, 193 League members had delivered 2,738 carts of manure, and mobilized non-League youths to deliver 2,377 carts of manure. Eighty percent of all fertilizers have been delivered. In Anguo’s second district, 150 League members in twelve League branches such as Zhang Ling accumulated nearly 6,000 carts of fertilizer in February. Some League members also joined with the masses to form mutual aid groups to deliver manure and pull soil to accumulate fertilizer. Some League members persuaded their families and the masses to increase pigsties and purchase piglets, which not only increased the source of fertilizer but also promoted the family's sideline production. In addition, League members in various places actively helped the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and cadres who lacked labor, as well as widowed and lonely households. For example, six League members in Wujiao Village in the fourth district of Ding County helped the families of military dependents and widowed and lonely households deliver manure and pull soil for a total of 112 carts.

Currently, League members in various places are using vacant land, sandy beaches, and other areas to carry out tree planting activities. According to statistics from nine League branches in Ding County and Xinle, 703 League members have planted 13,840 trees.

In their labor, League members actively responded to the government's call to promote the organization of mutual assistance. According to statistics from 12 League branches in Xinle, 129 League members led the masses to organize 32 mutual assistance production groups. According to statistics from eight mutual aid groups in Boye, 48 of the 94 mutual aid group members were League members. Some League members also united the masses, working together during the day and studying together at night, achieving a combination of production and learning.

The leadership work of the League branches in various places still has shortcomings. For example, they only pay attention to leading League members and neglect leading and uniting the production work of the vast number of young people in the entire village. The leading organs in various places should pay attention to inspection and guidance to improve this.

　　定县专区团员带头生产  帮助家长订出植棉计划
    【本报讯】河北省定县专区各地的青年团员，在今年的春耕准备工作中起了积极带头，推动群众的作用，全专区青年团员将近三万名。在二月份欢渡春节声中，许多团员即利用年节，动员家长作出全年的生产计划。如定县十二区三十二个团支部中，即有五百名团员在春节中召开了家庭会议，作出了全年的生产计划和种植计划。有的团员以算账的方式，说明种棉的利益，说服家长多种棉花，以响应政府增加工业原料种植的号召。新乐县的十二个团支部中，有七十二名团员不独帮助自己家庭作了生产计划，还帮助十二户群众订了家庭生产计划。在开展订户计划中，许多团员主动与群众商量，提议合资添购农具，增凿和修理水井，购买水车，为今年大生产增加了力量。
    春节刚过，一般妇女还在戴红花、穿新衣的时候，许多男女青年团员即动手在家起圈、倒粪、送粪和积肥。如蠡县六区西河等五个团支部二月底统计，一百九十三名团员已送粪二千七百三十八车；并发动团外青年送粪二千三百七十七车；全部肥料已送完百分之八十。安国二区张令等十二个团支部，一百五十名团员在二月份积肥近六千车。有的团员并与群众合组互助小组，共同送粪和拉土积肥。有的团员说服家庭与群众，增加猪圈，添购小猪，既增加了肥料来源，也促进了家庭的副业生产。此外，各地团员并积极帮助缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属和干部家属以及孤寡户。如定县四区吴交村等处六名团员即帮助军属和孤寡户送粪、拉土共一百十二车。
    现在，各地团员正利用隙地沙滩等开展植树运动，据定县、新乐九个团支部的统计，七百零三名团员已植树一万三千八百四十棵。
    团员们在劳动中，积极响应了政府推行组织互助的号召，据新乐十二个团支部的统计，有一百二十九名团员带动群众组织了三十二个互助生产小组。博野八个互助组中的统计，九十四名互助组员中有四十八名为团员。有的团员并团结群众，白天在一起生产，晚上在一起学习，做到了生产与学习相结合。
    各地团支部的领导工作，有的还存在着缺点：如只注意领导团员，而忽视领导、团结全村广大青年群众的生产工作。各地领导机关应注意检查指导，加以改进。
