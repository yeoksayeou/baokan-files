    Is a Voucher System Feasible?
    Comrade Cao Jukun, Deputy Director of the State Council's Financial and Economic Commission Planning Bureau, Believes There are Many Difficulties.
    Editor:
    In order to coordinate with our new financial management system and save on cash usage, I suggest that government agencies and public enterprise departments (including the agencies themselves and all their employees) should not use cash when purchasing goods from state-owned trading companies and cooperatives.
    When agencies buy goods, they can use checks; when employees buy goods, the agencies (including public enterprises) can first enter into credit guarantee contracts with state-owned trading companies, guaranteeing that their employees can purchase goods from state-owned trading companies without cash, using vouchers instead, and the agencies will be responsible for settlement and transfer of funds later. I believe this voucher can be divided into two types:
    (1) Registered vouchers – State-owned trading companies that have signed contracts issue vouchers to the agencies that have signed contracts. If an employee of an agency wants to purchase goods from a state-owned trading company, they can apply to the voucher issuing unit of the agency (such as the accounting department or general affairs department) for a voucher from that state-owned trading company. The applicant must first state the amount of goods they intend to purchase. After the voucher issuing unit of the agency verifies and issues the voucher, it fills in the maximum purchase amount and the purchaser's name and unit on the voucher, and affixes the official seal and the responsible person's signature. The employee or family member requesting the voucher can then take the voucher to the designated state-owned trading company to purchase goods. The purchasing procedures and the internal accounting procedures of the trading company will be studied and formulated separately. The trading company records and tabulates the amount of purchases made by employees of each agency separately each day, converts it into real value, and settles accounts with each agency once a week, after which it can transfer funds through the People's Bank. As for how the agency deducts the real value from the employee's salary, or deducts the real value in installments, it can study and stipulate it itself.
    (2) Unregistered vouchers – Printed by each agency, or issued to employees as part of their salary. This type of unregistered voucher has a fixed amount printed on it, and can be used to purchase goods in state-owned trading companies like currency, replacing cash circulation. After receiving this type of voucher, the state-owned trading company can exchange it for a bank check from the issuing agency. As for the amount of the voucher, it is of course difficult to match the amount of the purchase exactly. If the purchase amount is higher than the voucher amount, the purchaser can make up the difference with cash. If the purchase amount is less than the voucher amount, the trading company will make change with small denomination circulating coupons (or vouchers) issued by the company, instead of cash. These small denomination circulating coupons issued by the company can be used to purchase goods at the issuing company at any time, just like cash.
    I believe this method is suitable for the current cash management system's policy of saving cash as much as possible and promoting transfer accounts. It can also be said that this is one of the specific links in the transfer account system of our new economic policy. This may save some cash, so that one yuan can be used many times over, which will be beneficial to restoring production and stabilizing the currency; and it can also strengthen the recirculation of currency through state-owned trading companies. If this voucher method can be implemented, it can be extended to schools, organizations and private factories in the future. (Even in the capital alone, the figures are considerable.) This will be beneficial to price stability.

    Comrade Chen Yikun:
    Regarding your suggestion, we have specifically asked Comrade Cao Jukun to reply as follows:
    The idea of ​​agencies, organizations and all employees not using cash when purchasing goods from state-owned trading companies, but using vouchers instead, is very good, and it can indeed reduce some cash payments. Last year, the Northeast issued wage coupons to guarantee the income of employees, which played a significant role in protecting the interests of employees. However, in actual implementation, there are still many difficulties. The main problem is that employees need miscellaneous, diverse and dispersed items, and state-owned trading companies cannot yet meet the needs of the vast majority of employees. In remote cities, it is even more difficult for state-owned trading companies to have all the goods available, and the settlement procedures are extremely troublesome, and there are many accounting problems that are difficult to solve. According to the experience of the Northeast, when prices are stable, although this method can save some cash, it is better to use cash because the procedures are troublesome. In order to save cash, transactions between state-owned enterprises and between state-owned enterprises and cooperatives can use a contract system and transfer accounts with bank checks, which has obvious effects.

### 购货券制度可行吗？政务院财政经济委员会计划局副局长曹菊如同志认为困难很多。

　　购货券制度可行吗？
    政务院财政经济委员会计划局副局长曹菊如同志认为困难很多。编辑同志：
    为配合我们的新财政管理制度，节省现金的占用，我建议目前应急速实施政府机关及公营企业部门（包括机关本身及其全体职工），向国营贸易公司及合作社购货时，概不用现金的办法。
    在机关买货时，可以用支票；在职工购货时，可先由各机关（包括公营企业）与国营贸易公司间订立信用保证合同，保证各该机关职工向国营贸易公司购货时可以不用现金，而用购货券来代替，将来再由各该机关来负责清算划账。这种购货券我以为可以分为二种：
    （一）记名的购货券——由订立合同的国营贸易公司，发给订立合同的机关购货券。该机关职工如果要上哪一个国营贸易公司去购货时，就可向该机关核发购货券的单位（如会计科或总务等单位）请求发给哪一个国营贸易公司的购货券，请求者需先声明预定购货的金额。经该机关核发购货券单位审核后发给购货券，并在券上填上购货的最高金额和购货人姓名、单位，再盖上了公章及负责人名章。请求发票的职工或家属即可持券往指定的国营贸易公司去购买东西。购货手续及贸易公司内部的会计手续，则另行研究拟定。贸易公司方面每天将各机关职工购货额分别记载统计，并折实，每周与各机关清算一次，清算后即可在人民银行划账。至于机关方面如何向职工薪资内折实扣回，或者折实分期扣回，则可自行研究规定之。
    （二）不记名的购货券—由各机关印发，或发薪时发给职工一部分。这种不记名的购货券上面是有一定的金额的，与货币一样，可以在国营贸易公司里购货，代替现金流通。国营贸易公司收到这种购货券后，即可向发券机关换取银行支票。至于购货券的金额，当然很难与购货的金额一致。如果购货额高于购货券金额时，购者可以现金来补齐。如果所购货额小于购货券金额时，则贸易公司以本公司发行的小额流通券（或购货券）来找齐，而不以现金来找齐。这种公司所发的小额流通券，则同现金一样，随时可以到发行的公司里去购货。
    这种办法我认为是适合于当前现金管理制度的尽量节省现金推行转账的方针的。亦可说这亦是我们新经济政策里的转账制度中的具体环节之一。这样可能省下来若干现金，使一块钱的票子能顶很多倍的用处，这才能有益于恢复生产与通货稳定的；并且还可加强通货经过国营贸易公司来回笼。这种购货券办法如果可以实行的话，将来还可以推展到学校团体和私营工厂里来实行。（即在首都一地，其数字亦是很可观的）这样对物价稳定是会有好处的。
                                    百货公司会计科  陈漪坤陈漪坤同志：
    你的建议，我们特请曹菊如同志答复如下：
    关于机关团体及所有职工向国营贸易公司购货时，概不用现金，而使用购货券来代替的办法，用意是很好的，也确能减少一部现金支付。去年东北为保证职工的薪金所得，发行了工薪券，在保证职工利益上是起了很大作用。但实际执行结果，困难还很多，最主要问题是职工所需物品，零星、多样而分散，国营贸易公司暂时还不能满足广大职工要求。在偏僻城市中，国营贸易公司更不易商品俱全，且在结算手续上极其麻烦，在会计手续上更有许多难以解决的问题。据东北经验，在物价平稳时，用此办法虽能节省些现金，但因手续麻烦，还不如用现金为好。为节省现金，国营企业之间的往来及国营企业与合作社之间的往来，可以用合同制度，用银行支票转账清算的办法，这是有明显效果的。  编者
