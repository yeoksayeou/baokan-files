According to the Hebei Daily, the Spring Ploughing Inspection Group led by Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and member of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, arrived in Ding County Prefecture on April 7th, focusing on inspecting the preparations for cotton planting.

The task of planting 1.4 million mu of cotton in Ding County Prefecture accounts for 11.66% of the province's cotton planting task, more than double that of last year. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office had already assigned the task to the counties, and each county had made resolutions at the People's Representative Conference to complete the cotton planting task. In order to increase the cotton planting area and improve cotton production, most villages have launched a subscription plan campaign. However, many district-level cadres still lack confidence in completing the cotton planting task, and most counties and districts have failed to meet the tasks required by the Provincial Economic Conference. For example, Boye County's cotton planting task is more than 150,000 mu, but according to preliminary statistics, the cotton fields reserved by the masses are still 40,000 mu short. There is still a lack of specific solutions to the contradiction between cotton planting and other crops. As a result, individual farmers have falsely reported reserved cotton fields. Secondly, farmers seriously maintain conservative, self-sufficient small-peasant economy thinking, fearing that planting more cotton will not guarantee a harvest, and it is better to plant all kinds of crops. In newly planted cotton areas, they are afraid of lacking cotton planting experience and not being able to pick much cotton. Some are even worried that the price of cotton will fall if more cotton is planted.

Based on the above situation, Lin Tie pointed out that the previous cotton planting preparation work in Ding County Prefecture focused more on political mobilization and lacked specific in-depth organizational inspection work. No solutions were found to resolve the contradiction between cotton planting and other crops, and therefore, there was a lack of a material foundation to break down farmers' concerns about planting cotton.

Oppose Waiting for Luck, Conduct Cotton Field and Cottonseed Inspection

The Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Party Committee decided that it is very timely to start with full force and combat actions to focus on cotton planting and drive the cultivation of other crops. In order to ensure the completion of the cotton planting task, it is emphasized to oppose waiting for luck and to start early. Large flowers must be planted early to bloom early. It is necessary to carry out the movement of checking cotton fields and cottonseeds in a practical and in-depth manner. Through the methods of exchange, loan, and sale, the 3,694,500 jin of cottonseeds prepared by the prefecture must be loaned and sold to households before the Grain Rain solar term. All levels of cadres must take action immediately to guarantee the realization of this. In particular, it is necessary to widely publicize cotton cultivation methods through various forms, pick cottonseeds, and check the germination rate of cottonseeds to increase cotton production. Advocate intercropping, such as planting peanuts, grains, and sweet potatoes between wheat ridges, and freeing up land for cotton planting to solve the contradiction between cotton planting and grain planting. In particular, planting sweet potatoes between wheat ridges will not only yield a considerable harvest of sweet potatoes, but also allow the sweet potatoes to be dug up at the Autumn Equinox without delaying wheat planting; or planting cotton between sweet potatoes, peanuts and other crops. These methods should also be promoted and tried throughout the province. To ensure the cotton harvest, we must focus on several key aspects, such as selecting seeds, planting large-ridge flowers, applying more fertilizer, and preventing and controlling cotton pests and diseases. In particular, aphids (honeydew bugs) are prone to occur when the Grain in Ear solar term arrives, so tobacco water and other methods must be used repeatedly to eliminate them in order to increase cotton production.

Trial Establishment of Cotton Purchase Contracts to Eliminate Farmers' Doubts about Cotton Prices

Based on its own strength or acting as an agent for the cotton yarn and cloth company, the prefectural supply and marketing cooperative should try to establish cotton purchase contracts in villages with a lot of cotton planting. After autumn, the masses will deliver cotton according to the specifications of the contract, and the supply and marketing cooperative will supply the masses with necessities according to the agreement. This is a specific method to eliminate the masses' doubts about the cotton price policy and fears of food and fuel shortages from planting too much cotton. It can be piloted with focus to create experience.

Lin Tie also pointed out: We should repeatedly explain to the farmers that with the leadership of the People's Government, we must move towards a planned economy, which will reasonably regulate the market for industrial and agricultural products. Our cotton is not too much, but insufficient, and the government will absolutely guarantee the cotton price policy.

　　中共河北省委书记林铁等
    赴定县专区检查种棉
    替群众想办法解决耕作中的困难才能打破农民对于种棉花的顾虑
    【本报讯】据河北日报消息：由中共河北省委书记、河北省人民政府委员林铁所率领的春耕检查组于四月七日到达定县专区，着重检查了种棉准备工作。
    定县专区一百四十万亩的植棉任务，占全省种棉任务的百分之一一·六六，比去年增种一倍以上。专署早已将任务分配到县，各县又都在本县人民代表会上作出完成植棉任务的决议，为了增加植棉面积与提高棉花产量，一般村庄都开展了订户计划运动。但不少区级干部还缺乏完成种棉任务的信心，一般县区均达不到省经济会议所要求的任务。像博野植棉任务十五万多亩，据初步统计，群众所留的棉田仍少四万亩。对种棉和其他作物的矛盾，还缺乏具体解决办法，结果个别农民有假报留棉田的现象。其次是农民严重的存在着保守的自给自足的小农经济的思想，怕多种棉花保不住收成，不如什么庄稼都种些好。在新开始种棉的地区，怕没种棉经验，多摘不了棉花。更有的顾虑种的棉花多了棉价跌落。
    林铁根据上述情况指出：定县专区过去的种棉准备工作，多着重在政治动员，缺乏具体深入的组织检查工作，没想出解决种棉和种其他作物矛盾的办法，因此缺乏物质基础，打不破农民对种棉的顾虑。
    反对等待侥幸心理进行棉田棉籽检查
    专署与地委决定目前开始以全力和以战斗行动突击种棉带动其他作物的耕作，是很合时机的。为保证完成种棉任务，强调反对等待侥幸心理，一定要早动手，大花要早种早开花，切实深入地开展查棉田、查棉籽运动，通过换贷卖的办法，将专区准备的三百六十九万四千五百斤棉籽，于谷雨节前贷卖到户。这些都须各级干部马上行动起来，保证实现。特别是须要通过各种形式，广泛宣传棉花的耕作法，拣棉籽和检查棉籽的发芽率，使棉花增加产量。提倡兼作，如在麦垅间种花生、谷物、洋山芋，腾出地来种棉，解决种棉和种谷物的矛盾。特别是在麦垅间插洋山芋，不但不少收获山芋，还能在秋分节刨掉山芋不误种麦；或在山芋、花生等作物间种棉花，这些办法全省也应推广试行。在保证棉花的收成上，要抓住选种，耩大垅花，多施肥，防治棉花的病虫害等几个环节，尤其是芒种节到来易发生蚜虫（蜜虫），要三番五次的用烟草水等办法消灭它，来达到棉花的增产。
    试办订立订购棉花合同消除农民对棉价的怀疑
    专区供销社根据自己的实力或预代花纱布公司，在种棉多的村庄，试办订购棉花的订立合同工作，秋后群众按合同的规格交棉花，供销社按约供给群众必需品，这是消除群众怀疑棉价政策、怕种棉多缺吃烧的具体办法之一，可以有重点的去试办，创造经验。
    林铁并指出：我们应反复的向农民解释，说明有人民政府的领导一定要走向有计划的经济，会合理的调剂工农业产品的市场，我们的棉花不是多，而是不够用，政府绝对能保住棉价政策。
