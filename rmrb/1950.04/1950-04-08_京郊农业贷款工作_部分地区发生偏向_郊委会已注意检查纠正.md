Agricultural Loan Work in the Suburbs of Beijing Suffers from Deviations in Some Areas
	Suburban Committee Has Noticed and is Inspecting and Correcting
[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency, agricultural loan work in some areas of the Beijing suburbs has deviated from the correct path. The Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government, in addition to issuing a circular to all districts to conduct a general inspection and correction, has also formed an inspection team with the Municipal People's Bank of China and the Municipal Cooperative General Society to conduct inspections in various districts. There are four main deviations: First, loans are not made with emphasis based on the degree of need of the farmers, but are distributed equally. For example, when early-maturing crop loans were being made, Huangtugang Village in the Fifteenth District divided 9,800 jin of millet equally among the farmers' association groups; Bazhen Administrative Village divided the loans equally by "lv" (a local administrative unit), and the Seventh "lv" further divided them equally by household. Second, a small number of farmers, after receiving loans, indulge in eating, drinking, and wasting, and do not use the loans for production. For example, a poor peasant in the Fourteenth District used all of his early-maturing crop loan for drinking; a middle peasant gambled away thirty jin of millet he had borrowed. Third, some farmers used the loans as living expenses. For example, Liu Zhangshi, a farmer in the Sixteenth District, ate ten jin of the fifty jin of millet she borrowed. Fourth, some areas gave loans to landlords and rich peasants who were not short of production materials. For example, Zhendesi Village in the Fourteenth District lent 92 jin of millet to three landlord households and one rich peasant household. The main reasons for these deviations are that some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the loan work, and there is a serious prevalence of careless, rough-and-ready work styles, a lack of investigation and research, and a bureaucratic work style of not conducting timely inspections. On the other hand, some farmers only care about solving their immediate living difficulties and do not plan for long-term interests. In response to the above situation, the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government specifically pointed out in its circular: loans must be given to farmers who are truly actively engaged in production and lack production materials, and farmers must be actively assisted and educated to solve their living difficulties through mutual aid and mutual assistance in developing sideline production, so as to ensure that all production loans are used for production.

　　京郊农业贷款工作  部分地区发生偏向
    郊委会已注意检查纠正
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京郊部分地区的农业贷款工作发生偏向。市府郊区工作委员会除通令各区普遍检查纠正外，并与市人民银行、市合作总社共同组成检查小组分赴各区进行检查。主要偏向共有四种：第一、不是根据农民需要程度进行重点贷放，而是平均分配。如进行早熟作物贷款时，十五区黄土岗村按农会小组平分小米九千八百斤；巴沟行政村把贷款按闾平分，而第七闾又按户平分。第二、少数农民得到贷款后，吃喝浪费，不用于生产。如十四区中一个贫农将全部早熟作物贷款用于喝酒；一个中农将贷得的小米三十斤赌光。第三、有些农民将贷款充作生活费用。如十六区农民刘张氏贷得小米五十斤后，吃掉了十斤。第四、有的地区给了并不缺乏生产资料的地主和富农。如十四区镇国寺村贷给三户地主，一户富农小米九十二斤。发生这些偏向的主要原因是由于部分干部对贷款工作认识不够，并严重存在着粗枝大叶，缺乏调查研究，不及时检查的官僚主义作风。另一方面是由于部分农民只顾解决目前生活困难，不为长远利益打算。针对上述情况，市府郊委会在通令中特别指出：必须将贷款贷给真正积极生产而又缺乏生产资料的农民，并积极帮助与教育农民从互助互济发展副业生产中解决生活困难，务使生产贷款全部用于生产。
