Xinhua News Agency, 17th - Compiled from TASS dispatches of the 16th: The people of France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria angrily denounce the provocative act of American military aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace. According to *l'Humanité*, just protests are surging from all parts of France. The Standing Committee of the Fighters for Peace and Freedom Association issued a communiqué stating: "At a time when the movement to ban the atomic bomb is underway worldwide, the deliberate intrusion of U.S. aircraft into Soviet airspace is one of the preparatory stages for using the atomic bomb in a war of aggression. Clearly, the aggressor is assessing the defenses of the country it intends to attack."

The Polish newspaper *Armed Poland* pointed out that this act is a practical manifestation of the "total diplomacy" of American imperialist adventurers. However, the strong note from the Soviet government has defeated this provocation. Even the reactionary *New York Daily Mirror* had to admit: "Despite all the efforts of the total diplomats, the Soviet Union has once again defeated us diplomatically." The *Warsaw Daily* stated: American military aircraft, under the orders of Acheson and Johnson, are barbarically infringing upon the sovereignty of two European countries (referring to Denmark and Sweden), but the Soviet Union is neither Denmark nor Sweden. *Republic* stated: The Soviet Union's decisive response is a bucket of cold water and a warning thrown in the face of the provocateurs.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party's *Red Right* stated: The provocative actions of American imperialism are a crime against all of humanity, which strives for peace.

The Bulgarian *Workers' Cause* commented: The appearance of American military aircraft over Soviet territory cannot be explained as a "mistake." Here, we see first and foremost a rude disregard for the Soviet border and a deliberate violation of international law. The American exercises in the Baltic Sea are unprecedented and disgusting provocations. Washington's lies say that the United States and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty are carrying out "defense" against "Soviet aggression," but on this coast, thousands of miles away from the United States, they are organizing aggression and not defense. The provocations of American imperialists make it even clearer to everyone that it is necessary to strengthen the struggle to stop the instigators of a new war.

　　警告美帝对全人类和平挑衅罪行
    法、波、捷、保人民抗议美机侵苏领空
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社十六日消息：法、波、捷、保人民怒斥美国军用机侵犯苏联领空的挑衅行为。据人道报报道：法国人民的正义的抗议正自各地涌来，争和平自由战士协会常设委员会为此发表公报，指出：“当此禁用原子弹运动正在全世界进行之际，美机的蓄意侵犯苏联领空，就是将原子弹用于侵略战争的准备阶段之一。显然侵略者是在估量它所要进攻的国家的防务”。
    波兰《武装的波兰》报指出：这一行为是美帝国主义冒险家的“总体外交”的实际表现。但苏联政府的坚强的照会已击败了这种挑衅，就连反动的纽约每日镜报也不得不承认：“纵使有总体外交家的一切努力，苏联还是再度在外交上把我们打倒了。”华沙报称：美国军用机奉艾奇逊和詹逊的命令，正在野蛮地侵犯两个欧洲国家的主权（按指丹麦和瑞典），但是苏联既不是丹麦，又不是瑞典。共和报称：苏联的断然回答，成为对挑衅者迎面泼来的一盆冷水和警告。
    捷共红色权利报指出：美帝国主义的挑衅行动，就是反对力求和平的全人类之罪行。
    保加利亚工人事业报评称：美国军用飞机出现于苏联领土上空是不能以“错误”来解释的。这里我们首先看到了对于苏联边境的无礼蔑视和对于国际法的蓄意违犯。美国在波罗的海的演习，乃是空前的和令人厌恶的挑衅。华盛顿的谎言说：美国和北大西洋公约的国家正进行“防御”“苏联的侵略”，但在这远距美国数千公里的海岸上，他们正在组织着侵略而不是什么防御。美帝国主义者的挑衅，使每一个人都更明白必须加强制止新战争挑拨者的斗争。
