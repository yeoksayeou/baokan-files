    Chairman Mao said: The Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements facilitate our efforts to carry out domestic construction work and jointly deal with possible imperialist aggression, and strive for world peace.

    The Sixth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee was held yesterday at 7:30 PM. The meeting was attended by Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairmen Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, and Central People's Government Committee members Li Lisan, Lin Boqu, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Wu Yuzhang, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Zhou Enlai, Luo Ronghuan, Ulanhu, Xu特立, Liu Geping, Ma Yinchu, Chen Yun, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Deng Xiaoping, Shen Junru, Shen Yanbing, Chen Shutong, Li Xijiu, Huang Yanpei, Cai Tingkai, Peng Zemin, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Li Zhuchen, Zhang Bojun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Xiruo, Chen Mingshu, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Yazi, Zhang Dongsun, and Long Yun, totaling forty-three people. Those attending as observers included members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Presidents and members of the Supreme People's Court, Deputy Procurators-General and members of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, members of the Government Administration Council, heads and deputy heads of various committees, ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, and banks under the Central People's Government, and the mayors and deputy mayors of Beijing and Tianjin, totaling more than one hundred and seventy people.

    The main agenda of the meeting was to approve the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements signed simultaneously. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai first delivered a report on the Sino-Soviet treaties and agreements, followed by speeches from Committee members Cheng Qian, Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Committee member Zhang Zhizhong, Committee member Guo Moruo, and Committee member Ma Xulun, all of whom unanimously praised the Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements. After a brief speech by Chairman Mao Zedong, the meeting unanimously passed resolutions approving the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed in Moscow on February 14, 1950, the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet Agreement on a loan to the People's Republic of China. In addition, the meeting also heard reports from Committee member Lin Biao on the work situation in the Central and Southern region and from Committee member Deng Xiaoping on the work situation in the Southwest region, and passed four appointment proposals.

    Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report on the Sino-Soviet treaties and agreements that due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the profound friendship that has long existed between the people of China and the Soviet Union has now been solidified by treaties and agreements. The signing of these treaties and agreements not only consolidates and develops the comprehensive friendly mutual assistance and cooperation between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, but also powerfully defends peace in the Far East and world peace. It makes a population of more than 700 million people, unbreakable united together, becoming an invincible force.

    Committee member Cheng Qian, in his speech, recounted the facts that the Soviet Union has consistently sympathized with and assisted the Chinese people since the October Revolution. He said: The Sino-Soviet New Treaty thoroughly shattered the conspiracies of reactionary factions at home and abroad, consolidated lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world, and will greatly help China's peaceful construction and economic prosperity. The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China in the new treaty is deeply appreciated.

    Committee member Huang Yanpei said: The Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements effectively blocked imperialist aggression, strengthened the forces for defending world peace, and consolidated the foundations for the universal security of mankind. The New Treaty was concluded on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Therefore, it is a comprehensive manifestation of a high degree of internationalism and patriotism.

    Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: The Soviet Union has always extended a helping hand to the Chinese people. Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted everyone to take Russia as a teacher during his lifetime, and his will also called on everyone to unite with nations in the world that treat us equally and fight together. Therefore, we were deeply confident of success before the treaty was signed, but the Sino-Soviet New Treaty is even better than we originally imagined. All democratic parties wholeheartedly support the historic work of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou.

    Committee member Zhang Zhizhong said: The Sino-Soviet New Treaty stipulates the prompt conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, which is of particularly great significance. It severely strikes at the conspiracy of American imperialism to rearm Japanese aggressor forces and stir up trouble to disrupt peace in the East, and greatly helps China's economic construction. Committee member Zhang Zhizhong also explained in detail the huge benefits to the economic construction of Northwest China from the two agreements on economic cooperation in Xinjiang signed in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

    Committee member Guo Moruo said: This truly friendly treaty, which unites 700 million people, is a great encouragement to the Chinese people and China's friends, and a great blow to reactionaries, crazy imperialists, and warmongers.

    Committee member Ma Xulun said: The Sino-Soviet New Treaty, filled with the spirit of equality and friendship, is completely in line with the common interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and is especially valuable to the newly established People's Republic of China.

    Chairman Mao Zedong said before the vote: We have pointed out that implementing the people's democratic dictatorship and uniting international friends are two basic conditions for consolidating the victory of the revolution. The Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements concluded this time have fixed the friendship between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union in legal form, giving us a reliable ally, which facilitates our efforts to carry out domestic construction work and jointly deal with possible imperialist aggression, and strive for world peace.

    The meeting adjourned at 11:30 PM.

　　中央人民政府委员会第六次会议
    批准中苏条约及协定
    毛主席说：中苏条约和协定便利我们放手进行国内建设工作和共同对付可能的帝国主义侵略，争取世界的和平。
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府委员会于昨日下午七时半举行第六次会议。出席会议的有中央人民政府主席毛泽东，副主席朱德、刘少奇、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜，中央人民政府委员李立三、林伯渠、林彪、彭德怀、吴玉章、彭真、薄一波、聂荣臻、周恩来、罗荣桓、乌兰夫、徐特立、刘格平、马寅初、陈云、马叙伦、郭沫若、邓小平、沈钧儒、沈雁冰、陈叔通、李锡九、黄炎培、蔡廷锴、彭泽民、张治中、傅作义、李烛尘、章伯钧、程潜、张奚若、陈铭枢、谭平山、张难先、柳亚子、张东荪、龙云共四十三人。列席者有中国人民政协全国委员会委员，最高人民法院副院长、委员，最高人民检察署副检察长、委员，政务院政务委员，中央人民政府所属各委、部、会、院、署、行正副首长及京津两市正副市长共一百七十余人。
    会议的主要议程是批准中苏友好同盟互助条约和同时签订的两项协定。首由周恩来总理兼外交部长关于中苏间的条约和协定问题作了报告，继由程潜委员、黄炎培委员、李济深副主席、张治中委员、郭沫若委员、马叙伦委员等先后发言，对中苏条约和协定一致予以赞扬。会议在毛泽东主席简短致词后，全体一致通过决议，批准一九五○年二月十四日在莫斯科签定的中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，及中苏关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定。此外，此次会议还听取了林彪委员关于中南区工作情况的报告，邓小平委员关于西南区工作情况的报告，并通过了四项任命案。
    周恩来总理兼外交部长在报告中苏条约协定问题时指出：由于中国人民革命的胜利，久已存在于中苏两大国人民间的深厚友谊，现在得以条约和协定固定起来了。这些条约和协定的签定，不仅巩固和发展了中苏两大国家全面的友好互助合作，也有力地保卫了远东和平与世界和平。它使得七万万以上的人口，牢不可破地团结在一起，成为不可战胜的力量。
    程潜委员发言历述苏联自十月革命后，始终不渝地同情和援助中国人民的事实。他说：中苏新约彻底粉碎了内外反动派的阴谋，巩固了远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全，对中国的和平建设和经济繁荣将有重大帮助。苏联在新约中对中国无私的援助是十分可感的。
    黄炎培委员说：中苏条约和协定，有力地拦阻了帝国主义的侵略，加强了保卫世界和平的力量，巩固了世界人类普遍安全的基础。新约是在双方平等互利、互相尊重国家主权、领土的完整和不干涉对方内政的原则下缔结的，因此它是高度国际主义和爱国主义精神的综合表现。
    李济深副主席说：苏联对中国人民从来是伸出援助之手的。孙中山先生生前要大家以俄为师，遗嘱上也要大家联合世界上平等待我之民族共同奋斗。因此，在缔约之前就深信一定成功，但中苏新约却比我们原来设想的更好。各民主党派对斯大林大元帅和毛主席、周总理的历史性工作，衷心拥护。
    张治中委员说：中苏新约规定迅速缔结对日和约和中苏两国的经济合作，有特别重大意义，它严重地打击了美帝国主义重新武装日本侵略势力再起扰乱东方和平的阴谋，极大地帮助了中国的经济建设。张治中委员并详细地说明了根据中苏友好同盟互助条约精神而签订的关于在新疆实行经济合作的两个协定对于中国西北部经济建设的巨大利益。
    郭沫若委员说：这一团结了七万万人口的名实相符的友好条约，对中国人民与中国的友人是很大的鼓励，对反动分子、疯狂的帝国主义者和战争贩子是很大的打击。
    马叙伦委员说：充满了平等、友好精神的中苏新约是完全符合于中苏两国人民的共同利益，而对新成立的中华人民共和国尤其宝贵。
    毛泽东主席在表决前致词说：我们曾经指出，实行人民民主专政和团结国际友人是巩固革命胜利的两个基本条件。这次缔结的中苏条约和协定，使中苏两大国家的友谊用法律形式固定下来，使得我们有了一个可靠的同盟国，这样就便利我们放手进行国内的建设工作和共同对付可能的帝国主义侵略，争取世界的和平。
    会议至晚十一时半散会。
