　　Pravda Calls on Soviet Party and Government Personnel
    Correctly Handle Workers' Letters
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] TASS Moscow News: Pravda published an editorial on the 18th, pointing out that paying great attention to the letters and complaints of the working people is the sacred duty of every leader, every party, Soviet or administrative organ worker. The editorial stated: These letters and calls express the political activism of the masses, expressing their concern for further improving the work of all our organs and organizations, and concern for the consolidation of the strength of our socialist motherland. The Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin have repeatedly taught us to pay attention to listening to the voices of the masses. The letters of the working people help to develop Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, are signals pointing out violations of Soviet law, and help us fight against lifelessness, inertia, and bureaucracy, which are shackles restricting the creativity and spontaneous activism of the masses. Proper handling of these letters will help improve the work of state organs and help strengthen ties with the masses.

　　真理报号召苏联党政人员
    正确处理劳动者来信
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十八日发表社论，指出对劳动人民的函件和申诉加以极大注意，乃是每一个领袖，每一个党的、苏维埃的或行政机关的工作者的神圣责任。社论称：这种信件和呼声表示群众的政治积极性，表示他们关怀进一步改进我们所有机关和组织的工作，关怀我们社会主义祖国力量的巩固。布尔什维克党和斯大林同志曾一再教导我们要注意倾听群众的呼声。劳动人民的信件有助于发展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，是指出违犯苏维埃法律的信号，帮助我们和死气沉沉、因循苟且的作风斗争，和官僚主义斗争，这些作风是拘束群众的创造性和自发积极性的枷锁。对这些信件加以适当的处理，便有助于改进国家机构的工作，有助于加强与群众的联系。
