　　Students of Weihui Provincial High School in Pingyuan Province
    Assist Farmers in Pest Control Over a Thousand Mu
    [Report from this newspaper] Responding to the government's call to "Kill Pests to Protect Seedlings and Support the Masses," approximately 800 students from Weihui Provincial High School in Pingyuan Province assisted the Yancun and Da Liwan villages in the Fourth District of Ji County, the areas most severely affected by pests, for four and a half days from March 30th to April 3rd, controlling pests on a total of 1,193 mu. Due to the impact of the students' practical actions, the masses also generally took action to control pests, saving 3,400 mu of rapeseed seedlings in the two villages. The students also used their rest time to promote Sino-Soviet friendship, production policies, resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, and marriage policies. Some students even carried water for the masses. They were deeply welcomed by the local farmers. When they returned after completing their task, the masses posted slogans all over the streets, and the entire village held a meeting and saw them off for several miles.

　　平原省立卫辉中学学生
    协助农民打虫千余亩
    【本报讯】平原省立卫辉中学全体学生约八百人，响应政府“打虫保苗，支援群众”的号召，于三月三十日至四月三日共四天半时间，协助汲县四区虫灾最严重的彦村、大李湾二村，共打虫一千一百九十三亩。由于学生实际行动的影响，群众也普遍动手打虫，使两村三千四百亩菜籽苗获救。同学们并利用休息时间，宣传中苏友好、生产政策、人民代表会决议及婚姻政策等，有的同学还给群众担水。深受当地农民的欢迎。任务完成归来时，群众满街贴标语，全村人集会一直送了好几里。
