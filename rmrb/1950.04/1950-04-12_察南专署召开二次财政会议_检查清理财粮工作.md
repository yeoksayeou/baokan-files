　　Chanan Special District Administrative Office Convenes Second Fiscal Conference to Inspect and Rectify Financial and Grain Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News on April 4th: The Chanan Special District Administrative Office convened its second conference of county finance section chiefs on March 17th. In addition to arranging for unified fiscal management, this year's production assessment, and local grain management, it also inspected and summarized the work of village financial rectification, public bond sales, and the clearing of outstanding public and land grain.
    Regarding village financial rectification: in Chicheng, 30 villages were rectified; in Yu County, 174 villages; in Yanqing, 57 villages; in Huailai, 280 villages; in Xuanhua, 69 villages; in Yangyuan, 6 villages; in Longguan, 64 villages; and in Tianzhen, 82 villages. A total of 762 villages across eight counties. Although this rectification work was not entirely thorough, it played a significant role in stopping corruption and waste, and ensuring expenditures followed standards. Chicheng County performed relatively well. Statistics from the 30 rectified villages in the county showed that only 13 villages adhered to the system and spent according to regulations, while 17 villages exceeded the prescribed standards. The overspending was mainly on lamp oil, averaging more than 15% per village. This investigation proved that the previous lamp oil expenditure standard was slightly low, so the provincial finance conference's decision to raise the village fund expenditure standard by one level was correct.
    Regarding public bond sales: From January to March 24th, statistics show that all 13 counties in the special district had on average completed their quotas. Wanquan completed it the fastest, Yu County sold the most, while Yangyuan and Yanqing were the worst performers, with Yangyuan only completing 68% and Yanqing 70%. The main reason for failing to complete on time was insufficient leadership awareness.
    With the exception of Huaian and Wanquan counties, all other counties in the special district had not fully completed the collection of local grain, and there were large outstanding balances. In clearing the outstanding balances, Chicheng County performed the best, with concrete and practical methods. In January, the county had outstanding land grain in 170 villages, and now 119 villages have been cleared. During the clearing in February, based on the actual situation, 1,161 households were given a deadline to pay 35,453 jin of grain. 989 households substituted labor for payment (using labor to transport or work to offset public grain), providing 5,139 workdays, equivalent to 31,122 jin of rice, accounting for 28.8%. 1,070 households were exempted from paying 41,603 jin of grain, accounting for 38.5%.
    When clearing the outstanding balances, the village representatives, through democratic discussion, handled each case separately, considering the real situation of each household. This fostered mutual understanding between households with outstanding balances and those who had paid on time. In particular, the method of substituting labor for payment is a new clearing method in disaster areas or other regions, and this experience should be promoted in various places.

　　察南专署召开二次财政会议
    检查清理财粮工作
    【本报讯】据四月四日察哈尔日报消息：察南专署于三月十七日召开二次各县财政科长会议，除布置统一财政管理及今年评产工作、地方粮管理工作外，并检查与总结了村财政清理、公债推销、公粮地粮尾欠清理等工作。
    村财政整理了的村，赤城有三十村，蔚县有一百七十四村，延庆五十七村，怀来二百八十村，宣化六十九村，阳原六村，龙关六十四村，天镇八十二村。共计八个县七百六十二村。这些村清理工作虽不十分彻底，但对停止贪污浪费，按标准开支所起的作用是很大的。其中赤城县作得较好，该县在清理过的三十个村中统计，坚持制度按规定标准开支者只十三个村，超出规定标准者十七个村。其超支的主要是灯油部分，平均每个村超支百分之十五以上。根据这一调查证明过去灯油开支标准稍低一些，因此省财政会议决定村款开支标准提高一等的措施是正确的。
    公债推销工作：从一月份至三月二十四日统计，全专区十三个县，平均已全部完成。其中万全完成时间最快，蔚县最多，阳原、延庆最差，阳原才完成百分之六十八，延庆完成百分之七十。其所以未按期完成的主要原因是领导上对此认识不够。
    全专区除怀安、万全两县外，各县地方粮征收均没有全部完成，尾欠很大。在清理尾欠中，赤城县作得最好，方法具体，切合实际情况。在一月份该县地粮尾欠达一百七十个村，现已清理了一百一十九个村。二月份清理时根据实际情况，限期交纳者一千一百六十一户，粮三万五千四百五十三斤。以工代交（用劳力运送或作工顶交公粮）者九百八十九户，出工五千一百三十九个，折米三万一千一百二十二斤，占百分之二十八点八。免征者一千零七十户，粮四万一千六百零三斤，占百分之三十八点五。
    清理尾欠时，通过村代表会，经过民主评议，分别处理，一方面是切合各户真实情况，而又使尾欠户与完纳户之间，互相谅解，特别是以工代交的办法，在灾区或其他地区都是一个新的清理方法，各地应推广这一经验。
