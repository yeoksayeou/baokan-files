    Northeast China Exceeds First Quarter Industrial and Commercial Tax Revenue Target
    [Our Dispatch] Reporter Ai Fang reports: Northeast China has now exceeded its industrial and commercial tax revenue target for the first quarter of 1950. The first quarter has completed 42.56 percent of the annual target. The annual industrial and commercial tax revenue target for Northeast China was proposed at the joint conference of directors of tax bureaus of provinces and cities in Northeast China last October. The Northeast Taxation Bureau also learned about tax sources, industrial and commercial capital, its turnover rate, turnover, income and other situations from many aspects, and according to the tax regulations and tax rates promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, after detailed calculations, the final figures were determined. This figure is 53.8 percent higher than before. With the addition of customs duties and salt taxes, it has greatly exceeded the agricultural tax amount. According to the materials obtained by the Northeast Taxation Bureau, it shows that the final determined figure is far more accurate than in the past. However, due to the widespread false reporting by merchants and the incomplete investigation materials, it is estimated that this number is still lower than the actual amount that should be collected. As long as tax evasion can be prevented and collection is grasped, the task can be completed and exceeded. The results of the actual collection in the first quarter fully illustrate this situation. The industrial and commercial tax payments in the six provinces of Northeast China and five cities including Shenyang have generally exceeded the target. In January, Rehe exceeded the target by more than one time, and other provinces and regions exceeded the target by at least 40 percent. In March, Liaoxi exceeded the target by more than one time, and Harbin exceeded the target by 73.63 percent. In January, the entire Northeast exceeded the target by 61.84 percent, in February it exceeded the target by 22.45 percent, and in March it exceeded the target by 33.78 percent. The reasons for achieving the above results are first of all the active efforts of all tax workers. The Northeast Taxation Bureau used meetings, tax publications, quick reports, instructions and other forms to conduct full mobilization among all tax workers. When various places reported the smooth completion and exceeding of the target in January, the Minister of Finance and Director of the Taxation Bureau of the Northeast People's Government jointly issued a congratulatory letter, proposing to "make persistent efforts and complete greater victories," which further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. Once the peak tax season arrived, tax personnel worked day and night, automatically canceling holidays, demonstrating a high degree of work enthusiasm. The leadership promptly commended those who correctly implemented policies and successfully completed their tasks; those who performed particularly poorly were criticized. And they often exchanged experiences from various places, organized everyone to learn from each other, and studied their business. Secondly, leading cadres overcame the work style of bureaucracy and strengthened external work, using forces with emphasis, thus turning the past passive situation into an active one. Leading cadres specially proposed to seize the peak season, with the first and fourth quarters of the year being the peak tax seasons. It is estimated that these two quarters can complete 80 percent of the annual target. In terms of collection areas, the administrative division of importance and unimportance was broken, and the weight was determined according to tax revenue, forces were allocated, and some tax offices were cut and merged, and some tax offices were strengthened. In various taxes, the goods tax, which occupies a major position, was grasped. At the same time, a set of institutions and systems for taxation work was established and improved in order to truly grasp the materials, break through false accounts, lead democratic appraisal, and determine the amount of burden. These are important guarantees for achieving a reasonable burden and being able to complete the plan.

    东北第一季工商业税收超额完成
    【本报讯】记者艾方报道：东北一九五○年首季工商业税收任务，现已超额完成。第一季度已完成全年任务的百分之四十二点五六。东北全年工商业税收任务，是在去年十月东北省、市税务局长联席会上提出的。东北税务总局又多方面了解税源、工商业资金及其周转率、营业额、所得额等情况，按照中央人民政府政务院所颁布的税则、税率，经过详细计算，方最后确定数字。这个数字较前提高了百分之五十三点八。加上关税和盐税，已大大超过农业税额。根据东北税务总局所得材料，说明最后确定的这个数字，已远较过去精确。但由于商人普遍假报，调查材料还不够完备，估计此数仍较实际应征收数为低。只要能杜绝漏税，抓紧征收，是可以完成并超过任务的。第一季度实际征收的结果，充分地说明了这个情况。东北六省及沈阳等五个市缴纳工商税，已普遍超过任务。一月份热河超过任务一倍多，其他省区最少的也超过任务百分之四十。三月份辽西超过任务一倍多，哈尔滨超过任务百分之七十三点六三。全东北一月份超过任务百分之六十一点八四，二月份超过任务百分之二十二点四五，三月份超过任务百分之三十三点七八。取得以上成绩的原因，首先是全体税务工作人员的积极努力。东北税务总局利用会议、税刊、快报、指示等形式，在全体税工人员中进行了充分的动员。当一月份各地纷纷报告顺利完成并超过任务时，东北人民政府财政部长和税务总局长联署发出贺信，提出“再接再厉，完成更大的胜利”，更鼓舞了大家的情绪。税收旺季一到，税务人员日夜工作，自动取消了假期，表现出高度的工作积极性。领导方面对正确贯彻政策、圆满完成任务的人员，及时进行表扬；对完成任务特别不好的人员，则进行了批评。并且经常交流各地经验，组织大家相互学习，钻研业务。其次是领导干部克服了文牍主义的作风，加强了外部工作，有重点地使用力量，这样就把过去的被动状况变成主动。领导干部特别提出抓紧旺季，全年第一季度与第四季度为税收旺季。预计这两个季度可完成全年任务的百分之八十。在征收地区上，打破了行政上划分重要次要的界线，根据税收确定轻重，配备力量，裁撤合并了一些税务所，加强了一些税务所。在各种税收上抓紧了占主要地位的货物税。同时并建立、健全了税务工作上一套机构和制度，以便确实掌握材料，突破假账，领导民主评议，确定负担额。这都是做到负担合理，并能完成计划的重要保证。
