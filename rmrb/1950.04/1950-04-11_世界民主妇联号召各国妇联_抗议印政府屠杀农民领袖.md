Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th: A delayed dispatch from Paris: On March 31st, the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) sent a letter to democratic women's federations of all countries, requesting them to protest against the Indian authorities' rejection of appeals for peasant leaders sentenced to death. The letter stated: Among the 108 peasant leaders in the Telangana region of Hyderabad State who were illegally sentenced to death by an Indian military court, thirteen are about to be executed first. This sentence was delayed due to protests from all over the world. However, recently, the High Court of Hyderabad State, disregarding the opposition of progressive public opinion around the world, rejected their appeal to the Supreme Court. The WIDF, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and other democratic groups have unanimously protested against this illegal treatment of political prisoners and request that democratic women's federations of all countries take immediate action by sending delegations to the Indian embassies in their respective countries to protest against the Indian government's sentencing of these peasant leaders to death and to save those friends who are at the forefront of the Indian people's liberation struggle and have been sentenced to death.

　　世界民主妇联号召各国妇联
    抗议印政府屠杀农民领袖
    【新华社布拉格九日电】巴黎迟到消息：世界民主妇联于三月三十一日曾致函世界各国民主妇联，要求对印度当局拒绝被判死刑的农民领袖提出上诉一事，发出抗议。该函略称：曾被印度军事法庭非法判处死刑的海德拉巴邦特仑甘纳区的一百零八名农民领袖中有十三人即将首先被处死刑。这一判决前因世界各处的抗议，因而被延迟执行。但最近海德拉巴邦的高等法庭竟不顾世界进步舆论的反对，拒绝他们向最高法院的上诉。世界民主妇联、世界工联与世界民主青年联盟以及其他民主团体已一致抗议此一非法处置政治犯的行为，并请各国民主妇联立即采取行动，派遣代表团赴驻各国的印度大使馆，对印度政府把这些农民领袖判处死刑提出抗议，挽救那些站在印度人民解放斗争最前线的被判处死刑的朋友们。
