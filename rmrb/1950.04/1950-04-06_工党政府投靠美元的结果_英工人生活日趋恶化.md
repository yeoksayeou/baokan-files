　　The Result of the Labour Government's Reliance on the Dollar:
    The Deterioration of British Workers' Lives
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 5th] According to the British Information Service in London, the British Labour Government's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Cripps, released the annual "Economic Report" on March 28th. This report somewhat reveals that the lives of British working people are continuing to deteriorate. The report points out that clothing, food, and other household goods account for a greater proportion of household expenses, while expenses for beverages, tobacco, and entertainment have decreased. Although food expenses have increased significantly, the consumption of important foods such as meat and sugar is "much lower" than before the war. This means that due to rising prices, working people have to use a greater portion of their limited income for some of the most essential aspects of life, further lowering the overall standard of living. Secondly, the report proves that the difficulties in Britain's foreign trade after the war remain serious. Despite the Labour government's continuous reduction of domestic supply, increasing so-called "dollar" exports, and devaluing the pound, the total dollar deficit for the past year still amounted to approximately 1.1 billion dollars. Therefore, the issue of balance of payments will remain the "central economic problem for 1950 and many years to come." The report finally proposes four "hopes for this year," predicting that the Labour Party will continue to follow the old policy of relying on the dollar and intensifying the exploitation of workers. These four are: increasing the labor intensity of workers, continuing to freeze wages, continuing to rely on Marshall Plan "aid," and striving to enhance so-called overseas sales.

　　工党政府投靠美元的结果
    英工人生活日趋恶化
    【新华社五日讯】据英国新闻处伦敦消息，英工党政府财政大臣克利浦斯于三月二十八日发表一年一度的“经济报告”。这个报告多少透露了英国劳动人民的生活正在继续恶化。报告指出：衣着、食物及其他家庭用品在家庭开支上所占的分量加重，但饮料、烟及娱乐的开支，反而减少。虽然食物的开支增加很多，但像肉、糖重要食品的消费量，却较战前“减少很多”。这就是说，由于物价的上涨，劳动人民不得不以其有限收入中更多的部分，用于某些生活上最必需的方面，而使总的生活水平是更加降低了。其次，报告证明战后英国对外贸易上的困境，依然严重。尽管工党政府不断削减国内供应，增加所谓“美元”出口，贬低英镑，但去年全年美元的亏蚀，仍约达十一亿美元。因此，收支平衡问题，仍将是“一九五○年及以后许多年的中心经济问题”。报告最后提出四项“今年的希望”，预示工党将继续遵循投靠美元和加强压榨工人的旧方针，这四项就是增加工人的劳动强度，继续冻结工资，继续依靠马歇尔计划“援助”和努力增强所谓对国外的推销。
