　　Xuanhua Songjiaying Village CCP Branch Writes to Chairman Mao Reporting Production Plan
    Striving to Exceed Pre-War Levels and Challenging All Branches in the County
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Li Yongsheng reports: The Communist Party branch members of Songjiaying Village, Gujiaying District, Xuanhua County, Chahar Province, responded to the call for increased production and wrote to Chairman Mao to report this year's production plan, striving to make this year's agricultural production exceed the pre-war level. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    Our entire membership resolutely responds to the call to strive to make this year's agricultural production exceed the pre-war level. We have made a concrete plan and have the confidence to guarantee its realization. Now we are writing this plan to report to you, and with this plan, we challenge the branches of all villages in our county. The following is our plan:
    The whole village has 177 households, population: 373 males, 323 females, a total of 696 people. Labor force: 206 males, 106 females, a total of 312. Livestock: 2 horses, 8 mules, 76 donkeys. Land: 446 mu of paddy fields, a total of 3,838.3 mu including alkaline dry slopes and mountain paddy fields. We strive to increase production by 10% under the same weather conditions, increasing production by 1.2 dou (city dou) per mu.
    Improve agricultural techniques: millet, sorghum, wheat, and glutinous millet should be soaked before sowing. To complete this task, all party members must first learn to soak seeds. Before planting, each household should train a seed soaking person. And before the vernal equinox, organize women, children, and old men to pick up all the millet stubble. In order to kill viruses (especially??), purchase 100 jin of arsenic. Birds and animals are very harmful. When harmful birds are hatching, mobilize each child to pick 20 sparrow, pigeon eggs and small birds. There are 85 children in the village, which can pick 1,700 birds and eggs. Party member Luo Zhongyou guarantees to kill one wolf, and party member Zhao Tang guarantees to kill 15 rabbits. Promote improved crops: plant 100 mu of White Horse Tooth corn, and transfer 3 dou of Yuhuanggu seeds from Yu County, which can plant 30 mu. And ensure that each person plants 10 nests of large hemp seeds, a total of 7,000 nests. Sow rapeseed on 100 mu of bean fields and flax on 20 mu. The whole village has a total of 400 mu of bare stubble land, guarantee deep plowing once. Guarantee that the autumn plowed land will be plowed again, and guarantee that not a single mu of bare stubble land will be planted. In terms of fertilization, in addition to applying all the accumulated fertilizer, we will also mobilize every household to build a kang, and each household guarantees to build one kang, which can only be more, not less, and purchase 2,000 jin of ramie (fertilizer).
    There are 400 mu of river滩, which require 1,000 workers to open a canal. The entire land has been silted up and cannot be planted this year. There are two old wells, which will be restored this year to irrigate 6 mu of land. In terms of afforestation: For long-term construction, the county's all-sector representative meeting resolved that each person should plant 30 trees. This village is in a position to guarantee 40 trees per person, to be planted in three seasons. Plant 25 trees in spring, and plant the remaining trees in summer and autumn, totaling 28,000 trees. And plant 3 mu of nursery on the south river beach and build 10 mu of windbreak forest. Each young and middle-aged person collects 4 liang of elm seeds, and mobilizes every household to plant 4 *dong* of alfalfa, totaling 710 *dong*. Sideline occupations should be greatly developed this year: raising pigs, with a plan of one pig per household, and 15 households raising one sow. There are 95 pigs originally, and 82 more will be added. There were originally 3 large sows, and 8 more will be added. One chicken per person, there were originally 320 chickens, and 376 more will be added, and 30 more nests will be hatched, enough for one chicken per person. According to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, 80% of the manpower and animal power will be organized this year. 60% of women participate in picking stubble, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, and threshing. In terms of substitute farming: there are 10 households of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers' families, and workers' families, and 4 households lack labor. It is necessary to educate the masses to overcome the attitude of perfunctoriness and must do a good job of substitute farming. The whole village guarantees to weed millet, glutinous millet, and sorghum three times, and beans and wheat twice. This year's autumn plowing land will be 100% completed. Field selection will be done completely this year. In order to relieve the spring famine, 150 mu of wheat will be planted this year. At the same time, in all work, use the method of mobilization and persuasion on the masses, and do not commit the error of coercion and command. In addition, we saw that the Shalingzi Songjiazhuang branch in the ninth issue of the Branch Life magazine is doing a good job of leading production, and we specifically propose to challenge their village. If the Songjiazhuang branch accepts the challenge, they can send a letter of acceptance.
                                        Songjiaying Village, Gujiaying District
                                            Initiated by all Communist Party members of the CCP Branch

　　宣化宋家营村中共支部党员上书毛主席报告生产计划
    争取超过战前水平并向全县各支部提出挑战
    【本报讯】通讯员李永胜报道：察哈尔省宣化县顾家营区宋家营村中共支部党员响应增产号召，上书毛主席报告今年生产计划，争取今年农业生产超过战前水平。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们全体党员坚决响应号召，争取今年农业生产超过战前水平，我们作出了具体计划，有信心保证实现。现在把这计划写出来报告你，并以这个计划，向我们全县各村支部提出挑战。下面是我们的计划：
    全村一百七十七户，人口：男三百七十三口，女三百二十三口，共计六百九十六口。劳动力：男二百零六个，女一百零六个，共计三百一十二个。牲畜：马二匹，骡子八头，毛驴七十六头。土地：水地四百四十六亩，碱旱坡山水地在内共三千八百三十八亩三分。我们争取在同等年景下把产量提高一成，每亩增产一斗二升（市斗）。
    提高农业技术：谷子、高粱、小麦、黍子作到浸种。为完成这一任务，全体党员要首先学会浸种。未种地前，每户训练好一个浸种人员。并在春分前组织妇女儿童老汉拾完谷茬。为杀害病毒（特别??），购买砒霜一百斤。鸟兽为害很厉害，在害鸟孵化时，发动每个儿童掏麻雀、鸽子蛋和小鸟二十个，全村儿童八十五名，计可掏鸟、蛋一千七百个。党员罗忠有保证打狼一只，党员赵堂保证打十五个兔子。推广优良作物：种白马牙玉米一百亩，调蔚县玉皇谷籽三斗，能种三十亩。并保证每人种大麻子十窝，计种七千窝。在豆地内带种菜籽一百亩，胡麻二十亩。全村白茬地假耕地计四百亩，保证深耕一遍。秋耕地保证再耕一次，并保证不种一亩白茬地。施肥方面，除把积下的肥施完外，并发动户户打炕，每户保证打炕一条，能多不能少，并购买麻生（肥料）二千斤。
    有河滩四百亩，用工一千个，开渠一道，全地已淤出，今年不能种上。有旧井两眼，今年恢复起来，浇地六亩。植树造林方面：为长期建设，县各界代表会决议每人植三十棵。本村有条件每人保证四十棵，分三季植完。春季植二十五棵，下剩夏秋植完，计二万八千棵。并在南河滩种苗圃三亩，造防风林十亩。每个青壮年采榆树籽四两，并发动户户种桔桔草四埬，计七百一十埬。副业要在今年大大发展：养猪，计划每户一猪，十五户养母猪一口，原有猪九十五口，还要增加八十二口，大母猪原有三口，还要再增八口。一人一鸡，原有鸡三百二十只，要再增三百七十六只，再孵三十窝，够一人一鸡。根据自愿两利，要在今年把百分之八十的人力畜力组织起来。百分之六十的妇女参加拾茬、夏锄、收秋、打场。代耕方面：有烈、军、工属十户，四户缺乏劳动力。要教育群众克服应付态度，必须作好代耕工作。全村谷子、黍子、高粱保证锄三遍，豆类小麦锄两遍。今年的秋耕地完成百分之百。今年完全作到田间选种。为了接济春荒，今年种小麦一百五十亩。同时在一切工作中对群众用动员说服的办法，不犯强迫命令的错误。另外，我们看到支部生活第九期沙岭子宋家庄支部领导生产搞得好，特提出与他们村挑战，宋家庄支部如果应战，可寄来应战书。
