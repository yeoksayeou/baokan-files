    Shangrao Concentration Camp
    Shao Yu

    In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of over 200,000 men launched a perfidious attack on the more than 10,000 men of the New Fourth Army's Jinan troops, who were tenaciously fighting behind enemy lines both north and south of the Yangtze River, creating the shocking Anhui Incident at home and abroad. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic individuals imprisoned at that time. With skilled brushstrokes, and filled with intense hatred and love, he depicted the facts he witnessed, creating the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The monstrous crimes of the Kuomintang secret agent bandit gangs and the revolutionary soldiers' heroic deeds of preferring death to submission are powerfully portrayed. This collection consists of twenty-three paintings and is being serialized in this edition. Twelve paintings have already been published, and today we are publishing the thirteenth. – Editor

    上饶集中营
    邵宇
    一九四一年，蒋介石匪军二十余万人对坚持大江南北敌后战场、艰苦奋斗的新四军晋南部队万余人进行背义的袭击，造成震惊中外的皖南事变，许多被捕的新四军将士们就被囚禁在上饶集中营。邵宇同志即是当时被囚禁的爱国分子之一，他用熟练的画笔，带着强烈的憎和爱，描出当日目睹的事实，构成“上饶集中营”画集。国民党特务匪帮的滔天罪行，革命战士宁死不屈的英勇事迹，都作了有力的表现。本集共二十三幅，在本版连载。前此已刊登十二幅，今日刊登第十三幅。　——编者
