　　Beijing First Tax Bureau Actively Mobilizes for Early Tax Payment;
    Industrial and Commercial Businesses Enthusiastically Challenge Themselves to Ensure Early Payment
    [Beijing News Agency Report] After the First Branch of the Beijing Tax Bureau issued the 1949 second half-year industrial and commercial tax payment notices, it immediately launched a campaign to mobilize industrial and commercial businesses to pay taxes early. In addition to sending staff to various groups to conduct publicity, the bureau held two mobilization meetings on March 31st and April 1st. At the mobilization meetings, various industrial and commercial businesses enthusiastically put forward challenges and pledged to pay early. For example, the entire Western clothing industry guaranteed to deposit taxes within five days, and the billiard hall industry guaranteed to deposit taxes within two days. Furthermore, of the 48 antique businesses within the jurisdiction of the branch bureau, 46 had already paid their taxes by the 1st. The Zhang Yugui group of the jewelry and jade industry, consisting of 15 households, had already paid all their taxes in advance on March 31st. (Shen Hua)
