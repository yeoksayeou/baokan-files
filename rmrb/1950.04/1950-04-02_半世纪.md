Half a Century
H. Ehrenburg

Forrest has long been surpassed. Not long ago, Paul Hoffman, a senior U.S. government official, declared: "This may surprise you, but Moscow is changing its mind about conquering America." I don't know if the listeners were surprised, but there were no reports of anyone seeking treatment from a psychiatrist. Senator Thomas (the one who comforts his mother with bombs) slightly altered Hoffman's nonsense, turning his gaze to another part of the world and saying, "The Soviet Union is going to occupy Africa." Secretary of Defense Johnson also raised the alarm, saying, for example, "An attack on the United States will be carried out at four o'clock in the morning." Senator Wiley, suffering from persecution mania, went even further, demanding that the U.S. government "move its offices onto constantly running trains and use television to manage the country." General Piott, the French representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, recently visited the United States; after meeting with his American colleagues, he stated, "The Russians may use various methods to hurl atomic bombs at the United States – using submarines, through Mexico, using ships with secret compartments, and even using diplomatic mail." And no one examined General Piott's health either.

A few weeks ago, General Eisenhower arranged a heartfelt conversation with Field Marshal Montgomery. Of course, this conversation was not just idle chat. When curious journalists asked them what they were talking about, Field Marshal Montgomery replied, "We were talking about the weather." The Field Marshal was mistaken: the weather now is not something he can command. Nor can General Eisenhower or those madmen in the Senate. Even if they make all the needles on their barometers point to "thunderstorm," it will not happen. Because the weather is now managed by the people. The people clearly know that we Soviets do not want to conquer America or seize Africa, that we do not intend to send atomic bombs to American senators in diplomatic mail or secret compartments, and that we will not attack them at four o'clock in the morning – or at four o'clock in the afternoon, either. People clearly know that the Soviet Union, China, and all the people's democracies are vigilantly guarding peace. That is why mothers in Europe and America, when putting their children to sleep, say to them: "Sleep soundly, little one, there are not only Johnson's bombs in the world, but also 800 million people who will never let Johnson run wild."

U.S. government officials always insist: "The communist movement is Russian expansion." If that were true, they might think about why there are so many communists in the world. They can hire two hundred or two thousand spies in many countries, but these people will never spread Truman's worldview; they are thoroughgoing professional deceivers. You can buy ministers, generals, inventors, but you can't buy the people. Who truly loves China – the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, now being cursed by even the American newspapers for ruining the country and harming the people, or the Chinese Communist Party, which has resolutely defended the motherland and fought against Japanese, American, and British imperialism for twenty years? Who are the patriots of France – the Communist Party members who fought heroically in the ranks of the Maquis (the French underground resistance organization during the fall of France), the comrades of Gabriel Péri and Daniel Casanova, or the Catholic Party members, the exiles in London, and the Washington sycophants who smile obsequiously in the reception room of the American embassy and are half-Vichyites? Who fought for the freedom of Italy – Gramsci's comrades-in-arms, or the gentlemen who live a wretched existence in the confessional chairs of the Vatican and the bedrooms of the Quirinal Palace?

Not long ago, while sitting in the Bolshoi Theatre, I thought of my childhood, of this theater at the beginning of the century. Moscow was then the edge of the world. If it is now the center of the world, it is not because we are arrogant and consider ourselves the most superior race, taking first place, but because we were the first to open the road to the new century. While they were lynching blacks and massacring Arabs, Annamese, and Indians, we created a country where people of all races live together in peace. While they were demolishing factories and burning grain, we built Kuznetsk, manufactured tractors, and reclaimed deserts. While they were educating their children with contempt for ordinary people, we raised the consciousness of the people, giving books to shepherds and bringing bricklayers into museums. While they were spreading ideas of hatred for humanity, we lived by Stalin's idea: "There is nothing more noble and sublime than the title of human being." That is why Mao Zedong and Togliatti, Poles and Frenchmen, are sitting together in the Bolshoi Theatre. I don't want to ask the person full of the smell of money to show their conscience—he simply has no conscience. If these madmen have not forgotten how to count, then let them count. Let them weigh the weight. Let them measure seven times.

After the First World War, they lost Russia. After the Second World War, they lost half a dozen European countries. Now they have lost another country, China, whose population is almost equal to the entire population of Europe. They should not think about a Third World War: if they dare to take this great risk, they will certainly lose everything.

Some centuries are like storms, others are calm; some centuries have inventions, others have plagues; some centuries are full of passion, others are stagnant like dead water. The twentieth century has its own destiny, a difficult and great destiny. It began with small things, with colonial wars and market scandals. It has experienced many things, too many things for these fifty years. But it resolutely moves towards its goal: this century will be written in history as the century of communism. The children now gathered around the simple or beautiful New Year tree, whether in Moscow, Paris, or New York, will see the happiness that has been bought at a great price, three times as precious. As this new year begins, we wish you a happy New Year and wish the great century and the carefree children a bright future.

专栏：摘文

　　半世纪
    Ｈ·爱伦堡
    福莱斯特老早被人超越。不久前，美国政府大员之一的保罗·霍夫曼宣称：“这可能使你奇怪，但莫斯科正在转念头征服美国。”我不知道听的人是否奇怪，但是到精神病专家那里去求治的消息一点也没有。参议员汤麦斯（就是那个用炸弹来安慰母亲的人），略为改变了霍夫曼的谰言，把目光投到世界上的另一部分道：“苏联要占领菲洲了。”国防部长约翰生也举起危险的号志，例如，他说：“对美国的进攻，将在早晨四点钟实行。”患着迫害狂想病的参议员怀利则更进一步，要求美国政府“移在不断奔驰的火车上去办公，用电视来管理国家。”联合国军事参谋委员会法国代表皮奥特将军不久前访问美国；他在和美国同僚会谈之后，发表谈话称：“俄罗斯人可能用各种方式向美国投掷原子弹——用潜水艇，通过墨西哥，利用具有秘密室的轮船，甚至可以使用外交邮件。”而这个皮奥特将军，也没有谁为他检查身体。
    几星期以前，艾森豪威尔将军约了蒙哥马利元帅举行恳谈，当然这种谈话不会是聊天性质。当好奇的新闻记者问他们谈些什么时，蒙哥马利元帅答道：“我们说的是天气怎么样。”元帅此言差矣：现在的天气不是他能指挥的。也不是艾森豪威尔将军或参议院中的那批狂人所能命令。即使他们使自己所有晴雨表上的针都指着“雷雨”，它也不会发生的。因为天气现在是由人民管理了。人民清楚地知道：我们苏维埃人不想征服美国或夺取菲洲，我们不预备在外交邮件或秘密室中把原子弹寄给美国参议员，我们更不会在早上四点钟——即在下午四点钟也不会去进攻他们的。人们清楚地知道苏联、中国、一切人民民主国家都是目光炯炯地守护着和平。这就是为什么欧洲和美国的母亲们在使孩子入睡时对他说：“安稳地睡吧，好宝宝，世界上不只有约翰生的炸弹，还有决不让约翰生胡作非为的八万万人在”的缘故。
    美国政府的官员总是一口咬定：“共产主义运动，是俄国的扩张。”如果真是这样，他们大可以想一想，世界上共产党为什么这样多？他们可以在许多国家雇佣二百或二千个间谍，但这些人决不会传播杜鲁门的世界观，他们是彻头彻尾的职业欺骗家。可以收买部长、将军、发明家，而买不到人民，谁真正爱中国——现在连美国报纸也在大骂着祸国殃民的蒋介石匪帮，还是二十年来坚决保卫祖国打倒日、美、英等帝国主义者的中国共产党？谁是法国的爱国者——是在马基（法国沦陷时的地下抵抗组织）的队伍中英勇搏斗的共产党员、迦勃利爱尔·潘利和达尼爱尔·卡尚诺夫的同志们，还是在美国大使馆传达室中胁肩谄笑的半维希分子的天主教党徒、伦敦的流亡者、华盛顿的食客？为意大利的自由而战的是谁——是迦姆希的战友，还是那些在梵蒂冈的悔罪椅上和宽利那的寝室中苟活着的绅士？
    不久前，坐在大剧院中的时候我想起了童年时代，本世纪初期的这个剧场。莫斯科在那时是世界的边缘。如果现在它成了世界的中心，那不是因为我们妄自尊大自命为最优秀的种族，以第一自居，而是因为我们第一个开辟了到新世纪的道路。在他们私刑黑人，屠杀阿拉伯人、安南人、印度人的时候，我们缔造了各种族人民和平共处的国家。在他们拆毁工厂焚烧谷物的时候，我们建设了库兹聂茨克，制造了拖拉机，开垦了沙漠。在他们以蔑视普通人教育孩子的时候，我们提高了人民的觉悟，把书送给牧童，把泥水匠带进了博物馆。在他们散播仇视人类的思想时，我们则以斯大林：“再没有比人这个称号更尊贵更崇高的东西了”的观念生活着。这就是为什么毛泽东和托里亚蒂、波兰人和法兰西人并坐在大剧院中的缘故。我不想请满身铜臭的人拿出良心——他是根本没有良心的。如果这些疯子还没有忘记计算，那么让他们算一算吧。让他们掂一下轻重吧。让他们量七次⑦吧。
    第一次世界大战之后，他们失去了俄罗斯。第二次世界大战之后，他们失去了半打欧洲国家。现在他们又失去人口几乎和欧洲全部居民相等的国家——中国了。他们还是不要再想第三次大战的好：如果他们敢于冒这个大不韪，他们一定失掉一切。
    有的世纪像疾风暴雨，有的风平浪静；有的世纪有发明，有的有疫疠；有的世纪热情澎湃，有的凝滞像死水。二十世纪有自己的命运，困难的、伟大的命运。它从细小的事情、从殖民地战争和市场上的丑事开始。它经历了许多事情，这些事情对于这五十年真是太多了。但它坚决地向自己的目标前进：这个世纪将以共产主义世纪的身份写在历史上。现在围在简陋的或是漂亮的新年树四周的孩子们，不论在莫斯科、巴黎或是纽约，将看到以重大代价换来的、三倍宝贵的幸福。当此岁序更新之际，我们敬祝新年快乐，愿大世纪和无忧无虑的小孩子们前途无量。
