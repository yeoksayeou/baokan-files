“Anti-Japanese Prisoners”
    A group of New Fourth Army revolutionary fighters, both men and women, are being escorted to a concentration camp. Seven or eight days of fighting and hunger have not diminished the comrades' heroic spirit. Among them are military commanders, political workers, medical staff, and soldiers... Some come from worker and peasant backgrounds, others are intellectuals; some are old soldiers from the Red Army era, and others are revolutionary youths from all over who joined during the Anti-Japanese War; many of them are Communist Party members. Look! In their hearts, the fire of anger is burning.

    “抗日囚徒”
    一群新四军的男女革命战士，正被押送到集中营去。七八天的战斗，饥饿，并未减少同志们的英雄气概。这里面有军事指挥员，政治工作人员，医务工作人员，战士……有的来自工农，有的是知识分子；一部分是红军时代老战士，一部分是抗日战争时来自各方的革命青年；其中有不少是共产党员。看吧！在他们的心头，愤怒之火在燃烧着。
