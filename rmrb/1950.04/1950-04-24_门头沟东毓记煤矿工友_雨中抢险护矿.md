Mentougou Dong Yuji Coal Mine Workers
　　Bravely Rescue the Mine in the Rain

[This Newspaper News] The workers of the jointly-owned public-private Mentougou Dong Yuji Coal Mine bravely repaired dangerous sections during the heavy rain, preventing serious damage to the mine. The factory had already prepared a flood prevention plan, but because it did not anticipate such heavy spring rains, the waterproofing project was not completed before this heavy rain. Heavy rains on the 15th and 16th created a dangerous situation in the mine. At this critical moment, all the mine's workers, in order to preserve the mine, bravely threw themselves into the rescue work. Foreman Chen Airen (Communist Party member) inspected the mine as early as 6:00 a.m. on the 15th and discovered that two large holes had been washed away in the shed road of the Puzheng small kiln well (connected to the mine's mechanized mining well). He reported to the administrative负责人(person in charge) on the one hand and mobilized six workers to actively repair and protect the kiln well on the other. Machinist Bai Zichuan (Communist Party member, model worker), mechanic He Weizhong, and mine police squad leader Han Zengxiang (Communist Party member) patrolled everywhere in the rain. When they discovered that the houses where the workers of the Puzheng small kiln lived were in danger, they helped the workers move to a safe place. Soon the houses collapsed, and the workers were saved from harm. Bai Zichuan also braved the rain to block the water flowing down from the mountain. Mechanic He Weizhong stayed up all night actively preventing flooding. Staff member Hui Shangang and surface worker Jia Shuan, among others, were soaked by the rain four or five times while blocking water and dredging ditches. Foreman Zheng Yuxiang, bricklayer Zhao Jinchun, carpenter Li Gentang, odd-job man Li Deyu, and twelve coal mining workers temporarily transferred from underground all actively participated in flood prevention, saving the mine from damage. The mine administration and the trade union are preparing to reward them on May Day. Those who are irresponsible will be given due criticism or punishment.

　　门头沟东毓记煤矿工友
    雨中抢险护矿
    【本报讯】公私合营的门头沟东毓记煤矿的工友们，在大雨中抢修险工，使矿井避免了严重损失。该厂早已作好防淹计划，但因未估计到春天会下这样大的雨，致防水工程在此次大雨前尚未完工。十五、十六两日连下大雨，矿井险象严重。在此紧急关头，全矿职工为保全矿井，奋勇投入抢救工作。监工陈爱仁（共产党员）于十五日早六点即绕矿巡视，发现普正小窑井（与本矿机采井相通）棚道被水冲破两个大洞，他一面向行政负责人报告，一面发动六个工友积极抢修保全了这个窑井。机师白子川（共产党员模范工人）机工何维忠矿警班长韩增祥（共产党员）三人，冒雨四处巡逻，发现普正小窑工人住的房子有危险就帮助工人搬到安全地方。不久房子倒塌，工友得免受害。白子川又冒雨堵挡了山上流下来的水。机工何维忠为积极防水一夜未睡。职员惠山刚，地上工人贾树安等人，为堵水、疏浚水沟被雨淋湿了四、五次。监工郑玉祥，瓦工赵锦春、木工李根堂、杂役李德玉和由井下临时调到井上的十二位采煤工友，都是积极参加防水使矿厂免受损害。该矿行政与工会正准备到五一劳动节时给以奖励。对于不负责任的分子将给予应得的批评或处分。
