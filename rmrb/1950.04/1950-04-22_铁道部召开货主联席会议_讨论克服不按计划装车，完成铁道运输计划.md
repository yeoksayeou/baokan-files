Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Central Ministry of Railways convened its first joint meeting with consignors on April 19th. Representatives from over twenty units, including the Ministry of Heavy Industry, China National Grain Corporation, and China Coal Corporation, attended. The central topic of discussion was the railway transportation plan. Additionally, opinions were exchanged on issues such as freight rates, cargo classification, loading and unloading, etc. Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, in his report on the implementation of the railway transportation plan, explained that in the first quarter of this year, the northern and southern railways only completed 58% of the consignment plans submitted by public and private enterprises due to the impact of consignors failing to load according to plan. However, there was progress month by month, with January completing 55% of the plan, February completing 58%, and March increasing to 63%. The main reason why various public and private enterprises could not load according to the consignment plan was that they did not submit wagon request plans based on the minimum quantity actually needed. Therefore, after the plan was approved, it was impossible to have enough goods to consign. Secondly, some enterprises temporarily changed their plans or altered the direction of transportation due to the impact of prices. Some goods were even transported aimlessly without regard to the needs of material exchange. Failure to load according to plan affected the completion of the railway transportation plan and caused a huge waste of national transportation capacity and financial losses. Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao pointed out in his speech that the railway transportation plan is a concentrated expression of the country's planned economic activities and is fundamentally different from the blind transportation of capitalist countries. He hoped that all enterprises and departments would thoroughly implement the ideology of planned economy and work together with the Ministry of Railways to thoroughly complete the people's railway transportation plan.

The representatives at the meeting unanimously agreed in their speeches that the reason why the consignment plan was not implemented on schedule and in full was that, in addition to the original failure to submit wagon request plans based on the minimum needs, many enterprises and units were newly established organizations with insufficient initiative and lack of experience, making it difficult to propose wagon request plans close to actual needs. Everyone also expressed that they would gradually overcome this difficulty in the future by uniformly strengthening business plans and accumulating management experience, so as to more fully and reasonably utilize the great artery of national economic construction – the people's railway.

### 铁道部召开货主联席会议  讨论克服不按计划装车，完成铁道运输计划

　　铁道部召开货主联席会议
    讨论克服不按计划装车，完成铁道运输计划
    【新华社二十日讯】中央铁道部于四月十九日召开首次货主联席会议。到会的有重工业部、中国粮食公司、中国煤业公司等二十余单位代表。会议讨论中心议题是铁路运输计划问题，此外，并就运费、货运分等、装卸等问题交换意见。滕代远部长在报告铁路运输计划执行情况中说明：今年第一季度南、北方铁路因受货主不能按计划装车影响，只完成公私营企业所提托运计划的百分之五十八，但逐月有进步，一月份完成计划内的百分之五十五，二月份完成百分之五十八，三月份增为百分之六十三。各公私营企业所以不能按托运计划如数装车的主要原因，是没有按照实际需要的最低数量提出要车计划，所以在计划核定后，便不可能有足够货物托运。其次是若干企业因受物价影响而临时变更计划或改变运送方向，甚至有部分货物未根据物资交流的需要而无目的地运输。不按计划装车的结果，影响了铁路运输计划的完成，并造成国家运输力的巨大浪费和财政上的损失。铁道部吕正操副部长在讲话中指出：铁路运输计划是国家计划经济活动的集中表现，根本区别于资本主义国家的盲目运输。他希望各企业部门把计划经济思想彻底贯彻，与铁道部共同为彻底完成人民铁路运输计划而奋斗。
    会议代表在发言中一致认为：托运计划没有如期如数实行，其原因除了原来未按最低需要提出要车计划外，还由于许多企业单位是新成立的机构，主动性不够和缺乏经验，难于提出接近实际的要车计划。大家并表示今后要在统一加强业务计划和积累经营经验的过程中，逐渐克服这一困难，以更充分、合理地利用国家经济建设的大动脉——人民铁路。
