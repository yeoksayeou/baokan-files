The People's Government's Surtax is for Building Local Enterprises:
	The Incorrect Explanation in "New Terminology Dictionary" Must Be Revised
	To the Editors:
	The "New Terminology Dictionary" (edited by Hu Jitao and Tao Pingtian), published by Chunming Bookstore, defines surtax in the economics category as: "A surtax is a type of local tax, levied as an addition to national taxes. Surtaxes are often a form of abnormal, extra-economic exploitation of the people."
	We believe this general explanation is inappropriate. If it refers to the surtaxes of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the past, it can be explained this way, but it does not apply to the tax laws of the current People's Government. Because the People's Government's local surtaxes are for the purpose of building local enterprises, and are reviewed and managed by the people themselves, there is no question of exploitation. This explanation must be corrected.

	Comrades Zhang Jing and Feng Benhua:
	The explanation of surtax in the "New Terminology Dictionary" is obviously incorrect. In order to give readers a correct understanding of surtax, we have specially requested the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government to explain as follows:
	We agree with the criticism made by Comrades Zhang and Feng of the explanation of surtax in the economics section of the "New Terminology Dictionary." The local surtaxes (we call them "attached levies") levied by the current People's Government are for the purpose of building various undertakings for the people (such as culture, education, and health), and are by no means exploitation. The Soviet Union also adopted the method of surtax in the past, which promoted the development of productive forces and ensured the consolidation of the socialist economic structure in the national economy. Therefore, the current surtax (attached levy) is essentially different from the surtax during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The "New Terminology Dictionary" published by Chunming Bookstore must revise this explanation.

### 人民政府的附加税是为兴建地方事业  《新名词词典》的错误解释必须修正

　　人民政府的附加税是为兴建地方事业
    《新名词词典》的错误解释必须修正编辑同志：
    春明书店出版的《新名词词典》（编者胡济涛、陶萍天）、在经济类畴内对附加税的注解为：“附加税是地方税收的一种，是附加于国税上征收的，附加税常为变态的超经济剥削人民的一种税收。”
    这种笼统的解释，我们认为是不妥当的。如指过去国民党反动统治时期的附加税，那是可以这样解释的，但不适用于现在人民政府的税法。因为人民政府的地方附加税是为了兴办地方事业的，由人民自己审核和管理，根本谈不到什么剥削。这种解释必须纠正。
            张竞  封本化张竞、封本化同志：
    《新名词词典》对附加税的解释，显然是不对的。为了使读者对附加税有正确的认识，我们特请中央人民政府财政部税务总局解释如下：
    我们同意张、封两同志对《新名词词典》经济栏中附加税解释的批评。现在人民政府所征收的地方附加税（我们说是附征），是为了兴建人民各项事业（如文教、卫生等），决不是剥削。苏联在过去亦曾采取附加税的办法，这促进了生产力的发展和保证了国民经济中社会主义经济结构成分的巩固。所以，现在的附加税（附征）与国民党反动统治时的附加税有本质上的不同。春明书店出版的《新名词词典》对这一解释必须加以修正。
