　　Favorable Conditions for Legitimate Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises are Growing
　　Sun Xiaocun

　　(I)

　　Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued the decision on unifying national financial and economic work, due to the diligent implementation by governments at all levels, the nation's materials and cash have been unifiedly dispatched, tax revenues and public grain are under the central government's unified control, warehouse clearance work is actively underway, and all levels of government agencies are tightening their staffing and saving expenses. All of this, in the short month of March, has brought about significant changes in the national financial and economic situation. It can be said that it has begun to enter a new stage.

　　Among these significant changes, the first to be pointed out is the abundance of material supply. The grain panic that was most easily encountered in large cities in the past has now basically disappeared. The unified control of public grain nationwide, and the unprecedented large-scale allocation that has been carried out, has solved the grain problem in large cities such as Shanghai, and even in medium-sized cities in various regions. This can be fully proven by the stability of grain prices in various places from the Spring Festival to the present. The supply situation of cotton, yarn, cloth, coal, and other daily necessities is similar to that of grain, and in some cases, the supply quantity greatly exceeds the consumption needs. This situation is most evident in cotton, yarn, and cloth. The abundance of material supply has stabilized the lives of urban people and is enabling the urban economy to return to normal day by day.

　　Second is the stability of prices. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, significant changes have taken place in the price situation in March. If December 31, 1949, is taken as the base number, i.e., 100, the price index on March 1 was 238.86, and by March 29, the price index had dropped to 189.67. This means that the price at the end of March increased by less than one time compared to the end of 1949, but decreased by about 20% compared to the beginning of March. Taking the quoted price of the real value unit as an example, in Tianjin, after the real value unit price broke the 6,000 yuan mark on February 19, it reached a peak of 6,651 yuan on February 22, and then gradually declined, reaching 5,924 yuan on March 29. In Shanghai, the highest price of the real value unit was 6,552 yuan on March 2, and it returned to 6,060 yuan on March 26, and recently it has retreated into the 6,000 yuan range. In Beijing, the highest price in mid-March also reached 6,640 yuan, and it dropped to 6,195 yuan on March 30, and recently it has also retreated into the 6,000 yuan range. Across the country, except for South China which is higher, and the Northwest and Central South which are next, the quoted price is higher than in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. In places such as Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Chongqing, it is only around 5,000 yuan. The steady decline in prices in March has many factors. For example, the payment of public bonds, the maturity of taxes, and the withdrawal of currency through trade, but the more important thing to point out is: First, the sufficient supply of materials. Second, the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. The importance of these two factors not only enabled the initial stabilization of prices in March, but also pointed out a future in which prices will become more and more stable. Because according to the decision of the Government Administration Council on unifying financial and economic work, it is generally not necessary to issue more currency in the future. If the currency is no longer issued, there is no reason for prices not to be stable. This is a truth that has been experienced for many years and that everyone cannot but admit.

　　Third, bank deposits have increased. This is because the stability of prices has changed the general public's concept from valuing goods over currency to valuing currency over goods. From the second half of March, commercial banks' deposits have increased. On March 30 and 31, Shanghai paid in public bond funds amounting to 300 billion yuan, but commercial banks' deposits of 400 billion yuan did not decrease much. According to the reflection from the trade sector, the amount of commodities listed on markets across the country has greatly increased, but the volume of transactions is not large. From this point, it can also be seen that the speed of currency circulation must have greatly decreased. As for the fact that commercial banks are finding it difficult to make loans after absorbing deposits because the situation of industry and commerce has not improved, this is also true.

　　Fourth, interest rates have fallen. Due to the above three factors, interest rates in the financial market have gradually decreased in the past month. The degree of recent declines can be said to have set a new record that has not been seen in five years. Since the second half of 1946, Shanghai's monthly lending interest rate has often been around 20%. In the following years, with the inflation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, interest rates have increased rather than decreased. In each major price surge, interest rates created a new record. On the one hand, this reflects the role of currency value insurance premiums, and on the other hand, it is really a heavy burden for industry and commerce. During the price surge in November last year, the black market interest rate in Shanghai reached over 100 yuan per thousand yuan per day. Regarding the situation in the past three months, according to the statistics of the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, the average daily interbank lending rate was 13.6 yuan in January, 14.2 yuan in February, 14.6 yuan in the first week of March, and dropped to 6.8 yuan in the fourth week. After that, it gradually decreased. After entering April, commercial bank lending retreated to a monthly interest rate of 18%. This is really the most gratifying phenomenon in the sound of price stability, because high interest rates are not only a burden for industrialists and merchants, but also play a role in inflating credit, which is extremely unfavorable to prices.

　　(II)

　　As the national economic situation begins to enter a new stage, while the broad masses of the people are watching this change with joy, an opposite phenomenon has occurred in several large cities, that is, some private industrialists and merchants are encountering great difficulties and are in danger of not being able to last. As far as the phenomenon is concerned, since the Spring Festival, dozens of private silver shops in Shanghai have closed down, and many factories have reduced production or closed down. Some factory or shop owners have even abandoned their factories and fled. What we hear from Shanghai is a chorus of difficulties. When analyzing this phenomenon, the main difficulty for industry and commerce today is the inflexibility of turnover. The reasons for this are: First, the shortage of funds themselves. They have always relied on borrowing to carry out production. After borrowing, the interest burden increases, but in the periodic price increases of inflation, not only is the interest burden not a problem, but sometimes they can even make a profit. This practice has been customary for more than a decade. Now that prices have begun to stabilize, if industrialists and merchants still rely on borrowing money to hoard goods or engage in production, it will put them in a very difficult situation. They hope that there will be another price surge, but the more they wait, the lower the prices become, and the more they wait, the heavier the interest burden becomes. This is one aspect. On the other aspect, the sales market for goods is sluggish, and they also encounter state trading institutions selling large quantities of materials in order to complete the task of currency withdrawal. This makes it even more difficult for their products to be sold. In this situation, industrialists and merchants are unable to repay their debts on the one hand, and feel exhausted for the conduct of reproduction at the same time.

　　(III)

　　The difficulties of industry and commerce, and some of the results produced thereby, are worthy of attention. But we must understand the reasons why these difficulties arise from the essence. Today's difficulties for industrialists and merchants have essential factors. Because China is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the long-term inflation of the Kuomintang reactionary government after the Anti-Japanese War has made China's industry and commerce, in general, accustomed to surviving under inflation and high prices. Individually, some industries and businesses, their business methods and objects, are inseparable from the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. For example, the excessive number of banks, money shops, import and export companies, and consumer places in Shanghai are not needed by a healthy and normal society. Since liberation, as our society and economy are gradually changing in nature, the elimination of some industries and businesses is inevitable. Industrialists and merchants must adapt to the new democratic society in the future. We should not and cannot make the future society adapt to that kind of industry and commerce in the past. Since the unification of national financial and economic work, the government will make great efforts to balance revenue and expenditure, control materials, shrink currency, and stabilize prices. All of this could not be done by the reactionary governments in the past, but today's People's Government is confident that it can complete it. If industrialists and merchants still treat today's government with the past's view, and still deal with today's business with the past's style, then they have arranged a wrong tragedy for themselves. This is one. The Chinese people have experienced more than a hundred years of imperialist exploitation, longer-term feudal landlord exploitation, and more than twenty years of bureaucratic capital plunder, plus long-term wars and disasters. The vitality is really exhausted. The lack of purchasing power of the general public, especially the broad masses of peasants, is a major problem in China's social economy today, and it is also the biggest obstacle to the development of industry and commerce. Before the purchasing power of the broad masses of the people has recovered, it is impossible for industrialists and merchants to exist and prosper in isolation. In the past, the false prosperity created by speculation, as well as the extravagance and waste of imperialists, feudal landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats, maintained the market in a few major cities. Now all of this no longer exists. This is two. Because industry and commerce have such essential difficulties, in this period, they must go through a period of transformation, conversion, and orientation towards the inland and facing the countryside. In other words, before embarking on the road to prosperity, a period of hardship that must be endured is inevitable. At present, industry and commerce are universally feeling pain. From another point of view, it can be said that they are in the midst of transformation and molting. We believe that what comes with this painful period is no longer greater pain, but a situation of stability and recovery. Now we can point out that these favorable conditions have been produced and are growing.

　　(IV)

　　These favorable conditions for industry and commerce have come with the new financial and economic situation. First of all, we must point out that the lowering of interest rates has greatly reduced the burden on industry and commerce, giving industrialists and merchants a considerable opportunity to breathe. Because the lessons of years of inflation have made every industrialist and merchant "short of funds." In cities with more developed credit, the situation where industrialists and merchants do ten yuan of business with one yuan of capital is more common. Therefore, in the early stage of price declines, interest rates did not fall quickly, which was the most painful thing for industrialists and merchants. The main key to the particularly deteriorated situation in Shanghai recently lies in this. Now that interest rates have fallen to the level before 1946 and are continuing to fall, the embarrassing situation of urgently seeking to sell goods because they cannot bear the burden of interest can gradually improve, and the interest rate decline makes borrowing easier, and the period can also be longer, which is of great benefit to industrialists and merchants. From now on, the interest figure will no longer be a prominent part of every industrial and commercial expenditure. As a result, the credit relationship and business of industry and commerce will gradually move towards a standardized path day by day.

　　Second, grain prices fell significantly in March, and the price trend in April is that grain prices in various places will tend to be more flat. In the past ten days, the grain markets in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have shown this situation. The stabilization of grain prices will reduce all expenses paid by industrialists and merchants, mainly wages linked to grain prices (although Shanghai uses real value units as the standard, grain accounts for the largest proportion), which will play a significant role in reducing industrial and commercial expenses. The stabilization of grain prices, from the perspective of the entire market relationship, is also a relative increase in the prices of other commodities. In the past, due to the uniquely high price of grain, industrialists and merchants suffered a double blow, that is, the production cost (mainly wages) continued to increase on the one hand, while the goods produced were relatively depreciated. In the future, grain prices will be stable, which will have a double beneficial impact on the industrial and commercial side.

　　Third, under the conditions of abundant material supply, currency contraction, and stable prices, all the efforts that industrialists and merchants have made in the past to protect currency value, maintain materials, and maintain reproduction, in addition to all normal business operations, will be unnecessary in the future. The interest and other expenses borne by interbank lending, the losses and warehouse rent borne by hoarding goods, and the huge manpower used to fight against inflation and high prices, can all be saved from now on. The set of standard business practices from more than a decade ago will re-emerge. Speculation is not allowed to exist, and excessive profits will no longer exist. Only the hard-working and honest business style of seeking profits from capital can exist and develop in the future society. We only need to see that the ones that are clamoring the most and suffering the most blows are only a few big cities, while the vast inland cities do not have this situation, or have it but not so serious. This proves that the more honestly the business is done, the smaller the pain felt in this transition period, and the greater the development in the future.

　　Fourth, the land tax and tax revenue levied by the reactionary Kuomintang government, and the public bonds that were collected, in other words, this power concentrated from the people, was not only not used properly, but a part of it fell into the pockets of the four major families and flowed abroad. Today, what the People's Government takes from the people will be used entirely for the people. This part of the concentrated purchasing power will be used in construction one after another. It is true that the purchasing power of the staff in today's People's Government is pitifully small, but the government's purchasing power is strong, and it will be of great help to industry and commerce when the appropriate time comes. For example, recently the large and small iron factories in Tianjin have been very developed. This is because the Ministry of Agriculture has customized 20,000 waterwheels in Tianjin. A government customizes 20,000 waterwheels for farmers (only a small part of the total). This would have been impossible in the era of the reactionary government in the past. There will be many such orders in the future. In short, when this fiscal accumulation in the hands of the government is used in a planned manner, it will be of great help to industry and commerce. Today, industrialists and merchants only see the government collecting taxes, raising public bonds, and withdrawing currency, and they inevitably have a misconception that these forces are concentrated from the people to the government, and will never come out again. This is a ridiculous idea. After the government concentrates this part of the power, it still has to use it, but it is used more reasonably, more effectively, in a planned way, and in a concentrated way. This part of the purchasing power will still take private industry and commerce as the main object in the future, and the arrival of this time will not be very slow.

　　Fifth, the purchasing power of the broad masses of peasants is the decisive factor in whether industry and commerce can prosper. From now on, the purchasing power of peasants will gradually increase. Tea and silk, which are important spring income for farmers in East China and other regions, will be launched one after another, and then the wheat harvest season will also arrive. This spring's rainfall in North China is more abundant than last year, and according to recent reports from various places, it is predicted that wheat can be harvested abundantly. If wheat can be harvested abundantly everywhere, the purchasing power of the broad masses of peasants will greatly increase, which means that the market problem that is most painful for industrialists and merchants today will be fundamentally solved. The total consumption of cloth in Northeast China in 1948 was only 1.2 million pieces, which increased to 3.2 million pieces last year. If wheat and rice can be harvested abundantly this year, then the sales market will be greatly changed. Therefore, we can say that assuming that the difficulties called for by industrialists and merchants today are all facts, then this difficulty, in addition to the type that should be converted in nature, has also reached its peak.

　　Sixth, since this unification of national financial and economic work, public enterprises are also required to pay taxes in accordance with regulations, and must hand in profits and depreciation on a monthly basis according to the plan. In this way, public enterprises have more arduous responsibilities in management than private industrial and commercial enterprises. This decision, on the one hand, forces public enterprises to embark on the road of economic accounting system and enterprise, and on the other hand, from the perspective of private industry and commerce, public enterprises no longer enjoy special rights and compete with private enterprises on an equal footing. This new situation is also worth mentioning, because compared to the era of the reactionary Kuomintang government, when state-owned enterprises under the leadership of bureaucratic capital enjoyed privileges and oppressed private enterprises, today's equal treatment should be regarded as a favorable condition for private industry and commerce.

　　(V)

　　In summary, today's private industry and commerce are in difficulty, but this difficulty is not as widespread and serious as some industrialists and merchants themselves have emphasized. The funds of industry and commerce are scarce, but this problem of scarcity should be viewed in conjunction with two situations, one is past consumption and the other is the hesitation and concern of reserve capital. Why do we say that difficulties should not be overemphasized? We can see from the situation in Tianjin and Beijing: In Tianjin, the number of industrial and commercial households last year was originally 32,305, the number of households that closed down at the end of the year was 1,255, and the number of households that were added was 6,120. After offsetting the increase and decrease, there was an increase of 4,865 households. The ones that increased were the hardware industry, iron and wood factories, grain stores, coal, salt, matting, and other industries that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. The ones that closed down or switched to other industries were mostly foreign goods consumption stores that completely relied on imperialism in the past, money shops that relied on bureaucratic capital, as well as superstition products manufacturing, Western clothing stores, gold and silver jewelry, and other industries. In Beijing, from January to February this year, a total of 477 new factories were approved to open by the Industry Bureau (including 203 households that had been opened before December 1949 but not registered), and a total of 153 households closed down. After offsetting the increase and decrease, there was an increase of 324 households. Among them, the weaving and dyeing industry increased the most, with a total of 109 households, the machinery and iron industry with 62 households, and the chemical industry with 14 households. Conversely, the trend and number of bank and money shop closures in Shanghai are indeed alarming, but during the capital increase last autumn, according to various estimates, half of the banks and money shops should not have increased their capital, but the result was unexpected, and the vast majority of them increased their capital. Some of Shanghai people describe the weakness of some banks and money shops well: "If a factory's turnover is stranded, it can drag down three or four banks and money shops." What is the necessity for the existence of such financial institutions? The recent successive closures only show that about half of them should not have increased their capital to continue operating last year.

　　Today, the scarcity of industrial and commercial funds is a fact, but this situation can be improved immediately if the reserve capital that is hesitating and even deeply hidden can be won over. Naturally, there are many conditions for winning these reserve capital to participate in production, such as market recovery, profit guarantee, normal labor-capital relations, investment guarantee, etc. Some of these conditions are growing, and some need to be worked hard, but basically they are moving in this direction. This matter is the work of the government and the responsibility of industrialists and merchants. In addition, after the economic situation is normal, the situation in which social scattered forces are concentrated through financial institutions and invested in industrial and commercial undertakings will also develop day by day. Therefore, the difficulty of the scarcity of industrial and commercial funds can be overcome.

　　The new is already being produced, and the old must be eliminated or converted; in the most difficult and painful time, new favorable conditions are growing. This is the new situation of today that every industrialist and merchant should recognize.

　　正当私营工商业的有利条件在成长中
    孙晓村
    （一）
    自从中央人民政府政务院发布了关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定以来，由于各级政府执行的努力，使全国的物资现金得到了统一的调度，税收、公粮由中央统一的掌握，仓库清理工作在积极进行，各级机关都在紧缩编制，节约开支。这一切，在三月份短短的一个月中，已使全国财政经济起了显著的变化，可以说，开始进入了一个新的阶段。
    在这些显著的变化中，首先要指出的，就是物资供应的充裕。过去大城市里，所最容易遇到的粮食恐慌，现在基本上已不存在了，全国公粮的统一掌握，并且进行了空前的大规模的调拨，已使上海这些大都市，甚至各地的中等城市在粮食问题上得到了解决。这从春节以来到现在为止，各地粮食价格稳定上可以充分证明。花、纱、布、煤炭以及其他日用必需品的供应情形，也与粮食相类似，有的甚至供应的数量大大的超过了消费的需要，这种情形，花、纱、布方面表现得最显著。物资供应的充裕，安定了都市人民的生活，并且使都市的经济一天一天的恢复到正常的状态。
    第二是物价的稳定。根据中央人民政府贸易部的统计，三月份的物价情况发生了显著的变化，如以一九四九年十二月三十一日为基数，即一○○，三月一日的物价指数为二三八·八六，到三月二十九日物价指数就降为一八九·六七，这就是说三月底的物价，比一九四九年年底涨了不到一倍，但比三月初降低了二成左右。拿折实单位的牌价而言，天津从二月十九日折实牌价破六千元大关以后，二十二日达到最高峰六六五一元，以后即盘旋下降，三月二十九日为五九二四元。上海折实单位牌价三月二日最高为六五五二元，三月二十六日回到六○六○元，最近已退入六千元大关。北京牌价三月中旬最高亦达六六四○元，三月三十日降到六一九五元，最近也退入六千元大关。全国各地除华南较高，西北、中南次之，牌价在京津沪以上外，南昌、九江、重庆等地，都只在五千元上下。三月份的物价稳步下降，因素固然很多，例如公债的缴款，税收的到期以及贸易上的通货回笼，但是更主要的应当指出：第一、是物资的足量供应。第二、是财政和现金的收支平衡。这两个因素，其重要性，不仅使三月份的物价能够初步稳定，并且指出了今后物价将愈来愈稳定的一个前途。因为根据政务院统一财政经济工作的决定，今后大体上已不需要再增发通货，通货不再增发，物价没有不稳定的道理。这是多少年的经验，也是谁都不能不承认的一条真理。
    第三，银行存款增加，这是由于物价稳定改变了一般人的观念，从重物轻币，开始转变为重币轻物。从三月下半月起，商业行庄的存款，均有增加，三月三十日三十一日两日，上海缴进的公债款，达三千亿元之巨，然而商业行庄的存款四千亿元，并没有减少什么；从贸易部门所反映的，全国各市场的商品上市量，都大大的增加，但是成交量却不大，由这一点也可以看出，通货流转的速率，也一定大大的减小了。至于商业行庄吸收存款后，因工商业情况尚未好转，一时感到放款困难，也是事实。
    第四，利息下降。由于上述的三种因素，使近一个月来，金融市场上的利息逐步降低，最近降低的程度，可以说开了五年来未曾有过的新纪录，一九四六年下半年起上海放款月息经常在百分之二十上下，以后这几年，随着国民党反动政府通货的膨胀，利息有增无减，在每一次物价大涨风中，利息即创造出一次新纪录，这一方面固然表现了币值保险费的作用，另一方面也实在是工商业很重的负担。去年十一月物价涨风时，上海的黑市利息，每千元每天达百元以上，最近三个月的情形，据中国人民银行华东区行统计，市场日拆，一月份平均为一三·六元，二月份为一四·二元，三月第一周为一四·六元，第四周即下降为六·八元。以后步步降低，进入四月份以后，商业银行放款退到月息百分之十八。这实在是物价稳定声中最可喜的现象，因为高利息不仅是工商业者的负担，而且他本身还起着膨胀信用的作用，对于物价是极为不利的。
    （二）
    在这全国经济情况开始进入一个新的阶段的过程中，广大人民正以愉快的心情在注视这种变化时，在几个大都市里，却发生了一个相反的现象，就是若干私营工商业者，遭遇到很大的困难，而且有岌岌乎不可终日之势。就发生的现象来讲，自从春节以来，上海的私营银钱业，停业的已有数十家，工厂减产停业的也很多，有的工厂或商店的老板，甚至弃厂逃跑，我们从上海所听到的是一片的困难声。把这种现象，加以分析时，则今天工商业的困难，主要的是周转不灵。其原因，第一是由于本身资金短绌，向来依靠借债来进行生产，借债以后，利息负担增加，但在通货膨胀物价周期性上涨中，不但利息的负担不成问题，而且有时还可以得到赚头的。这种做法，大家已经习惯了十几年了。现在物价开始稳定，工商业者还靠借钱来囤货或从事生产，便会使他们陷于非常困窘的境地。他们希望物价再有一次涨风，但是愈等而物价愈下，愈等而利息的负担愈重，这是一个方面。另一个方面，商品的销售市场不振，又遇到国家贸易机构为了完成通货回笼任务，而大量的销售物资，这样，使得他们的产品，更难于脱售。在这种情况下，工商业者一面无法偿还他们的债务，同时对于再生产的进行，也有力竭之感。
    （三）
    工商业的这种困难，以及由此而产生的一些结果，是值得注意的。但是我们对于这种困难何以会发生的原因，必须从本质上去了解。今天工商业者的困难，是有其本质上的因素的。由于中国是一个半封建半殖民地的社会，抗战以后，国民党反动政府的长期通货膨胀，使中国的工商业，一般的说来，习惯于在通货膨胀物价高涨下取得生存的，个别的说来，有些工商业，他们的经营方式和对象，是与半封建半殖民地的社会分不开的。如上海的过多的银行、钱庄、进出口公司、以及消费场所，不是一个健康正常的社会所需要的。解放以来，我们的社会经济，在逐步的改变性质中，一部分工商业的被淘汰，是无法避免的。工商业者要适应今后的新民主主义的社会，我们不应当也不可能，使今后的社会适应过去的那种工商业。自从全国财政经济工作统一之后，政府将以大力来平衡收支，掌握物资，收缩通货，平稳物价，这一切，在过去的反动政府，是想办亦办不到的，但今天的人民政府有把握的可以完成。如果工商业者，还以过去的看法，来对待今天的政府，还以过去的作风，来处理今天的业务，那是他自己为自己安排了一场错误的悲剧。这是一。中国人民经历了一百余年的帝国主义剥削，更长期的封建地主的榨取，以及二十余年的官僚资本的掠夺，再加上长期的战争和灾荒，元气实在是伤尽了，一般民众，尤其是广大农民的购买力的缺乏，是今天中国社会经济上的一大问题，也是工商业者发展经济的最大障碍。在广大人民购买力没有恢复之前，工商业者希望能够孤立的存在和繁荣是不可能的。过去，由投机所造成的虚伪的繁荣，以及帝国主义者、封建地主、军阀、官僚的奢侈与浪费，在维持少数几大都市的市面，现在这一切不再存在了。这是二。因为工商业存在着这样的本质上的困难，所以在这个时期内，必须要经过一段改造转业以及走向内地面对农村的过程，换言之，在走上繁荣途径之前，一段必须忍耐的困难时期，是无法避免的。目前工商业，在普遍的感觉痛苦，这从另一个意义上来看，可以说，正在转变蜕化的期中。我们相信，随着这一段痛苦时期而来的，不再是更大的痛苦，而是一个安定和复苏的局面。现在我们可以指出，这种有利的条件，已经产生，而且正在成长着。
    （四）
    这种对于工商业有利的条件，是随着财政经济新形势而来的。首先我们要指出，利息的降低，大大的减轻了工商业的负荷，给与工商业者一个不小的喘息的机会。因为多少年通货膨胀的教训，使工商业者，没有一个不“缺单”的，在信用愈发达的都市里，工商业者以一个钱资本做十个钱生意的情形愈普遍，因此，物价下降的初期，利息没有迅速的降落，这在工商业者是最痛苦的一件事。近来上海情况特别恶化的主要关键，便是在此。现在利息降落到一九四六年以前的程度，且仍在继续下降中；为了经不起利息的负担，而急求脱货的窘迫的情形可以逐渐好转了，而利息下降，借债反而容易，期间也可以较长，这对于工商业者是受惠很大的，从此每一个工商业的开支中，利息的数字不再成为突出的一个部分，其结果，将使工商业的信用关系与业务，一天一天走上正规化的途径。
    第二，三月份的粮价显著下落，四月份的物价趋势，各地的粮价将更趋疲平，最近十天来，上海、天津等地的粮食市场、已表现出这种情形。粮价疲平，使工商业者所支付的一切开支，主要的是与粮价联系的工资（上海虽以折实单位为标准，但粮食所占比重最大），将因之随着减少，这对于工商业的开支的减轻上，将起着显著的作用。粮价的疲平，从整个市场关系说来，也就是其他商品的价格的相对的提高。过去由于粮价的独特的高昂，使工商业者受了双重的打击，就是一方面生产成本（主要是工资）不断增高，另一方面，生产出来的商品，却相对地跌价，今后粮价稳定，则对于工商业方面，是起着双重的有利的影响的。
    第三，在物资供应充裕，通货收缩，物价稳定的状况下，工商业者过去为了保障币值，为了保持物资，为了维持再生产所从事的一切正常业务以外的努力，今后都成为不必要的了，拆头寸所负担的利息与其他开支，囤货物所负担的损耗与仓租，以及为与通货膨胀物价高涨作斗争所使用的庞大的人力，从今以后，都可以省掉了。十余年前那套经营业务的正规办法，将重新抬头，投机取巧是不容许存在了，暴利不再有了，只有勤勤恳恳老老实实将本求利的作风，才能在今后的社会中存在而且发展。我们只要看，最近叫嚣得最利害，打击受得最重的，只是几个大都市，而广大的内地的城市，反而没有这种情形，或者有而没有那样严重，这就证明了业务做得愈老实，在这转变期中所感受的痛苦便愈小，今后的发展也愈大。
    第四，过去国民党反动的政府所征收的田赋和税收，派募的公债，换言之，从人民身上集中起来的这份力量，不但没有好好的使用，而且一部分落入了四大家族的私囊，流到外国去了。今天人民政府所取之于人民的，将完全用之于人民。这部分集中了的购买力，将陆续使用在建设上。今天人民政府中的工作人员，购买力小得可怜，这是事实，但政府的购买力是强大的，在适当的时机到来时，对于工商业，将起着很大的帮助作用。例如最近天津的大小铁工厂，都业务很发达，这就是因为农业部在天津定制二万辆水车，一个政府为农民定制二万辆水车（仅仅总数的一小部分），这在过去的反动政府时代是不可能有的一件事，这样的定货将来很多。总之，政府手头这笔财政积累，有计划的使用时，对于工商业将是很大的帮助。今天工商业者，只看见政府收税款，募公债，通货回笼，不免有一种错觉，以为这些力量，从民间集中到政府，从此不再出来了，这是可笑的想法。政府集中了这部分力量之后，仍然要用出来的，不过是更合理、更有效、有计划的、而且集中的使用而已，这部分购买力，将来仍然要以私营工商业为主要的对象的，而且这个时间的到来，不会很慢的。
    第五，广大农民的购买力，是工商业繁荣与否的决定因素，从现在起农民的购买力，将逐渐增加了。华东等地区农民春季重要收入的茶叶、蚕丝将陆续登场，接着麦收的季节也将到来，今年春天华北的雨量，比去年充足，最近各地的报告，预卜麦子可以丰收。麦子如能普遍丰收，广大的农民购买力，将大大的增加，就是说，将基本的解决今天工商业者所最感痛苦的市场问题。东北一九四八年全年布匹的消费量，仅一百二十万匹，去年即增至三百二十万匹，今年麦子稻子如都能丰收，那么销售市场就大大地改观了。所以，我们可以这样的说，假定今天工商业者所呼吁的困难都是事实，那么这个困难，除了基本上应当转业的一类外，也已经到了最高峰。
    第六，自从这次全国财政经济工作统一以后，公营企业，依照规定也要纳税，而且要依照计划按月上缴利润和折旧。这样一来，公营企业，在经营上的责任，只有比私营工商业来得艰巨。这个决定，一方面，使公营企业不得不走上经济核算制以及企业化的途径，另一方面，从私营工商业立场来看，公营企业不再享受特殊的权利，与私营企业在同等的基础上竞争。这一新的情势，也是值得提出的，因为比到国民党反动政府时代，官僚资本领导下的官办企业，享受特权，以及对私营企业压迫的情形，那么今天的这种平等待遇，应当看作私营工商业的有利条件。
    （五）
    总结起来说，今天私营工商业是有困难的，但这种困难没有如一部分工商业者自己所强调的那样普遍，那样严重。工商业的资金是匮乏的，但这个匮乏的问题，应当结合两种情形来看，一种是过去的消耗，一种是后备资本的踌躇与顾虑。为什么说，困难不应当太强调呢？我们从天津与北京情况来看：天津方面，去年一年工商业户原为三二、三○五户，年底歇业者一、二五五户，增设者六、一二○户，增减相抵，共增四、八六五户。增多的是对国民生计有益的五金业，铁木厂，粮食店，煤炭，盐，席等业，歇业或转业的则多是过去完全依靠帝国主义的洋货消费店，依靠官僚资本的钱庄等，以及迷信品制造业，西服店，金银首饰等业。北京方面，今年一、二月份经工业局批准新开业工厂共四七七户（内有一九四九年十二月前已开设而未登记的二○三户），歇业共一五三户，增减相抵，计增加三二四户。其中织染业增加最多，共一○九户，机器铁工业六二户，化学工业一四户。反过来说，上海的银行钱庄停业的趋势和数字，固然惊人，但去秋增资时，据各方估计，应当有半数的银行钱庄不应该增资的，结果出人意外，绝大部分都增了资了。有些银行钱庄资力的薄弱，上海人形容得好：“一家工厂周转搁浅，可以拖倒三四家银行钱庄。”这种金融机构，有什么存在的必要呢？最近的相继停业，无非说明去年有半数上下是不应该增加资本继续营业而已。
    今天，工商业资金的匮乏是事实，但这种情形，如果能把正在犹豫徘徊甚至深藏的后备资本争取过来，立即可以好转。自然，争取这些后备资本来参加生产，是有许多条件的，例如市场的恢复，利润的把握，劳资关系的正常，投资的保障等。这些条件，有的正在成长，有的尚待努力，但基本上是在向着这个方向做。这件事，是政府的工作，也是工商业者的责任。此外，经济局势正常后，社会零星力量通过金融机构集中后，投向工商事业的情形，也会一天比一天发展。所以，工商业资金匮乏的困难，是可以克服的。
    新的已在产生，旧的必归消灭，或者转业；在最困难最痛苦的时候，新的有利条件已在成长了。这是每个工商业者应当认清的今天的新的形势。
