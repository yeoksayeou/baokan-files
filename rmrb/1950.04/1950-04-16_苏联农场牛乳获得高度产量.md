　　Soviet Farms Achieve High Milk Yields
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th] TASS, Moscow: Soviet collective farms and state farms achieved high milk yields last year. The "October 12th" Collective Farm in Kostroma Oblast has completed its three-year livestock breeding plan. The average milk yield per cow in the farm is 5001 liters, which is 11 percent more than the output stipulated for the end of 1951 in the three-year plan. The income from milk production accounts for half of the total income of the collective farm.
    In 1949, the amount of milk delivered by state farms to the state increased by 35 percent compared to 1948. At the purebred cattle breeding farm of the Omsk State Farm, the average annual milk yield per cow is 5002 liters. The Udava State Farm in Estonia produces 5775 liters, and the "Forest Square" State Farm in Moscow Oblast produces 5010 liters.
