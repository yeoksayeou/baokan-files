　　Yuci Prefecture Carries Out Spring Plowing Propaganda
    Using Slides and Exhibitions to Promote Agricultural Technology
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Hao Jinrui reports: Cultural centers in various counties of Shanxi Province's Yuci Prefecture are extensively using forms such as slides and exhibitions to carry out propaganda and mobilization work during spring plowing. The Yuci Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of the directors of the cultural centers of each county on March 15th, clarifying that propaganda for large-scale production is the central task of the cultural centers; the cultural centers should become the core institutions for organizing propaganda in the entire county. The meeting also exchanged and studied the past experiences of carrying out propaganda work such as with slides and exhibitions. After the cadres of the cultural centers of each county returned to their counties, they all held discussions with relevant departments (the Propaganda Department of the CCP County Committee, the County Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, various farms, hospitals, supply and marketing cooperatives, etc.), formulated plans for spring plowing propaganda, and have actively commenced work. Various localities are taking advantage of occasions such as spring temple fairs, town livestock fairs, and market days to hold exhibitions: for example, Yushe exhibited comparative pictures of seed soaking versus non-seed soaking at the town market. Jiexiu has already drawn twenty pictures based on the agricultural production reward measures promulgated by the provincial government; and has prepared more than seventy pictures including the comic strips "Li Shunda's Laboring Family," "Planting Trees and Making Forests," "How to Raise Babies," "Preventing Smallpox," and "Attending People's Schools," which are scheduled to be exhibited at the Hongshan Village temple fair on the 19th (third day of the third lunar month). Shouyang County had the farm prepare publicity materials for new-style agricultural implements, and the supply and marketing cooperative prepare publicity materials for black alum insecticide, while the cultural center, together with the judicial section and the public security bureau, drew pictures on the prohibition of gambling and drugs, which are scheduled to be exhibited in the county seat for five days, and in Songta Town, Zhong'ai Town, and other places for three days each. Taigu, Yuci, and other counties have convened symposiums for art workers, organized some folk artists, primary school teachers, and intellectuals in the countryside, who are drawing cartoons and organizing materials in preparation for spring plowing propaganda.
    At the same time, the cultural centers of each county are adding slide projectors and going deep into the countryside to show slides. Before March, six counties in the prefecture, including Xiyang and Heshun, already had slide equipment, and now other counties are also actively adding slide projectors. The Taigu Cultural Center has already drawn more than thirty slides on planting cotton, accumulating fertilizer, raising pigs, and epidemic prevention, and is preparing to go to the countryside after a trial screening in the town. The Zuoquan Cultural Center accepted the experience of the Heshun Cultural Center, improved its slide equipment, and newly produced more than fifty slides such as "Restoring Pre-War Production Levels," "Agricultural Production Reward Measures," and "Planting Trees and Making Forests," which were first shown at the end of March, and are now being shown at livestock fairs in Tongtan, Guai'er Town, and other places, in conjunction with exhibitions for propaganda. The cadres of the Pingyao slide propaganda team who go to the countryside, in addition to showing slides in the evening, also visit farmers during the day to collect on-the-spot materials and draw new slides in a timely manner. Shouyang had one set of slide equipment, and is now planning to add one or two more sets. According to statistics from all twelve counties in the prefecture, a total of more than one hundred and fifty kinds of new slides, nearly a thousand slides, have been drawn and are being shown in the countryside.
    In addition, various localities have universally reorganized propaganda equipment such as blackboards, radio stations, and clubs, and have compiled some lyrics and clapper rhymes that publicize production and express the deeds of model laborers, in order to carry out propaganda among the broad masses of farmers in a variety of ways.
    The Commissioner's Office also issued instructions a few days ago, ordering the cultural centers of each county to strengthen their leadership over spring plowing propaganda, and stipulating that they must report to the Commissioner's Office once every ten days.

    【本报讯】通讯员郝晋瑞报道：山西省榆次专区各县的文化馆，正大量运用幻灯、展览会等形式，开展春耕中的宣传鼓动工作。榆次专署曾于三月十五日召开各县文化馆主任会议，明确了为大生产宣传是文化馆的中心任务；文化馆要成为全县组织宣传的核心机构。会上并交流、研究了过去进行幻灯、展览会等宣传工作的经验。各县文化馆干部回县之后，均与各有关部门（中共县委宣传部、县府文教科、各农场、医院、供销社等）进行了商议讨论，订定了春耕宣传的计划，并已积极开展工作。各地一面利用春季庙会、城镇骡马大会与集市等场合举办展览会：如榆社在城关集会时展览了浸种与不浸种的对比图画。介休已根据省府颁布的农业生产奖励办法，绘制图画二十幅；并准备了连环画“李顺达劳动家庭”、“植树造林”、“怎样养娃娃”、“预防天花”与“上民校”等图画七十多幅，并定在十九日（阴历三月初三）举行的洪山村大庙会上展出。寿阳县由农场准备了新式农具、供销社准备了黑矾杀虫药剂的宣传材料，并由文化馆与司法科、公安局等绘制了关于禁赌、禁毒的图画，预定在县城展览五天，松塔镇、钟爱镇等地各展览三天。太谷、榆次等县均召开了美术、艺术工作者座谈会，组织了一部分民间艺人、小学教员和在乡知识分子等，正绘制漫画、整理材料，准备春耕宣传。
    同时，各县文化馆正增设幻灯，深入农村放映。三月份以前，该专区昔阳、和顺等六县已有幻灯设备，现在其他各县亦正积极增置幻灯。太谷文化馆现已画好种棉、积肥、养猪、防疫等三十多幅幻灯片，在城关试映一次，正准备下乡。左权文化馆接受了和顺文化馆的经验，改良了幻灯装备，又新制了“恢复战前生产水平”、“农业生产奖励办法”、“植树造林”等五十多片，已于三月底首次放映，现正在桐滩、拐儿镇等地的骡马大会上映出，并结合展览会进行宣传。平遥幻灯宣传队下乡干部，除晚间放映幻灯外，白天并访问农民，收集实地材料，及时绘制新片。寿阳原有幻灯设备一套，现正计划增加一套至两套。全专区十二县统计，现共绘制了新幻灯片一百五十多种，将近千片在农村中放映。
    此外，各地普遍整理了黑板报、广播台、俱乐部等宣传设备，并编出了一些宣传生产，表现劳动模范事迹的歌词、快板等，以多种多样的方式在广大农民中进行宣传。
