　　Plant Cotton with Confidence!
    Government Guarantees Normal Profits for Cotton Farmers

To the Editor:

　　Recently, the cadres of my township convened a meeting of farmers to persuade everyone to consider planting cotton (the Taicang area of Jiangsu is a cotton-producing region), hoping to restore production to pre-Anti-Japanese War levels, because the country urgently needs this industrial raw material to ensure people's clothing.

　　Based on the current situation, seeds, farm tools, and planting methods are not a problem. What everyone is concerned about is the price ratio between cotton and other agricultural products. Before the war, every hundred *guan jin* (local name *sima jin*) of seed cotton was roughly equal in price to two *shi* of white *japonica* rice. During the war, due to the Japanese occupation and later the Kuomintang’s allowing massive dumping of American cotton, the price of cotton fell, and as a result, no one planted cotton anymore. Therefore, we hope that the government will have a detailed overall calculation for increasing cotton production, and it would be best to guarantee a price ratio that allows cotton farmers to have appropriate profits. We also hope that this price ratio can be announced so that we farmers can calculate it.

Jiangsu Taicang County Farmer Fan Guisheng

Mr. Fan Guisheng:

　　The government pays great attention to the reasonable price ratio between industrial raw material crops and food grains. Currently, the Industrial Raw Materials Division of the Ministry of Agriculture is collecting cotton and grain prices from various places before the war, during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the war, as well as the production costs of planting cotton and grain, the food production and regulation situation in various cotton-producing areas, transportation conditions, and referring to the experience of implementing cotton-grain price ratios in North China last year for careful research. Initial opinions have been sent to relevant departments for discussion and are being submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for review, and are planned to be announced soon.

　　In 1949, in order to dispel farmers' concerns, North China announced a price ratio of one *jin* of ginned cotton to eight *jin* of millet during the spring sowing season. According to existing data statistics, the average cotton price in various parts of North China from September to December last year, except for November, which happened to match the price ratio of eight *jin* of millet, was one *jin* of ginned cotton equivalent to more than eight to nine *jin* of millet for the remaining three months. Many areas even exceeded the price ratio of eleven *jin* of millet due to the good quality of the cotton. In some individual areas, due to inconvenient transportation, insufficient strength of state-owned trading companies, failure to improve cooperatives, and market disruption by speculative merchants, the price of cotton was not guaranteed to be eight *jin* of millet, but this year will be an improvement over last year.

　　Last year, North China also adopted the method of paying public grain in cotton, which was: "Using dry, white, clean medium spray cotton with a lint length of 7/8 inch medium-grade American (foreign cotton) seed cotton as the standard, each *jin* of standard seed cotton is converted into 3.7 *jin* of millet, with price increases or decreases according to grade differences, but not lower than 3 *jin* of rice." This also greatly guaranteed the benefits of cotton planting. In short, the government wants to find various ways to ensure the normal interests of farmers planting industrial raw material crops, and hopes that everyone will plant with peace of mind.

　　As for sales, there is even less of a problem, because according to this year's cotton production increase plan, even the best harvest will barely be enough for the existing yarn factories to use.

### 安心种植棉花！  政府保证植棉农民正常利润

　　安心种植棉花！
    政府保证植棉农民正常利润编辑同志：
    最近我乡干部召集农民开会，劝告大家看植棉花（江苏太仓一带系棉产区），希望能把产量恢复到抗日战争前，因为国家很需要这种工业原料，以保证人民的衣着。
    根据现在的情况，种籽、农具、和种法都不成问题。大家所关心的是棉花与其他农产品的比价问题。战前每百关斤（我乡称司马斤）籽花价约等于白粳米两市石，战时由于日寇的垄断，国民党来后，又听任大量的美棉倾销，使棉花的价格跌落，结果大家都不种棉花了。因此希望政府对增产棉花有细密的通盘计算，最好能保证使棉农有适当利润的比价，并希望将该项比价公布出来，使我们农民来合计一下。
                        江苏太仓县农民  范桂生范桂生君：
    政府对工业原料作物与食粮的合理比价，是十分注意的。目前农业部工业原料司正着手搜集各地战前、抗战期间及战后的棉粮价格，种棉种粮的生产费用，各产棉区粮食生产和调剂的状况，运输情形，并参照去年华北区实行棉粮比价的经验等进行审慎的研究。现已将初步意见送有关部门商讨及呈报政务院财委会审核中，拟于最近公布。
    一九四九年华北区为了解除农民的顾虑，在春季播种时曾经公布了一斤皮棉与八斤小米的比价。根据现有资料统计，去年九月至十二月华北各地的平均棉价，除十一月恰巧合到八斤小米的比价外，其余三个月都是一斤皮棉折合八斤多至九斤小米，还有许多地区因为棉花的品质良好，高出了十一斤小米的比价。在个别地区，由于交通不便、国营贸易公司力量不足，合作社未能健全以及投机商人扰乱市场等原因，使棉花价格没有保证八斤小米，但今年会较去年改进一步。
    去年华北区还采用了以棉花折交公粮的办法，其办法是：“以干、白、净中喷花，绒长八分之七英寸中级美种（洋花）籽棉为标准，每斤标准籽棉折小米三斤七两，按等级差价升降之，但最低不低于三斤米。”也大大的保证了植棉利益。总之政府是要想各种办法保证农民种植工业原料作物的正常利益的，希望大家安心的种植。
    至于销路更不成问题，因为按今年的棉花增产计划，须有最好的收成，才刚够现有纱厂的使用。
