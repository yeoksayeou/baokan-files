　　Inspecting the Designated Use of Agricultural Loans
    Qiu Xinwu's Work Ethic is Worth Learning
    Qiu Xinwu, a comrade from the Dongjiao Branch of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, went to Dahuangzhuang Village in the 13th District to inspect the production loan work. When early-maturing seed loans were being distributed, a farmer named Zhao Zhong applied for a loan for 25 jin of potato seeds, and the working group approved his request. However, Zhao Zhong did not buy potato seeds. He told Comrade Qiu Xinwu this time: "I didn't plant potatoes. I bought 20 jin of spring wheat seeds, and I bought sorghum with the remaining money." Comrade Qiu was a little suspicious, fearing that the designated funds had not been used for their intended purpose, so he went to his field to see for himself. It turned out that autumn wheat seedlings were growing in the field. At this time, Zhao Zhong also honestly admitted his mistake and resolved to correct it thoroughly. We believe that Comrade Qiu Xinwu's serious and responsible work attitude is worth learning. (Yan Zirong)

　　检查农贷专款专用
    邱馨吾工作态度值得学习
    北京市供销总社东郊分社邱馨吾同志到十三区大黄庄村去检查生产贷款工作，该村农民赵忠在发放早熟种籽贷款时，他申请贷土豆种二十五斤，工作组批准了他的请求。但赵忠并没有买土豆种，他这次对邱馨吾同志说：“土豆我是没有种，我买了春麦种籽二十斤，剩的钱买了红粮。”邱同志有些怀疑，怕专款没有达到专用的目的，便亲上他地里去看，原是地里长着秋麦苗子。赵忠这时也老老实实承认了自己的错误，决心痛改。我们认为邱馨吾同志这种严肃负责的工作态度，是值得学习的。              （阎子荣）
