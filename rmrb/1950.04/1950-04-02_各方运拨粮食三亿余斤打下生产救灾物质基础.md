In order to urgently aid households without food and assist disaster victims in production, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office allocated another 190 million jin of relief grain and sideline production loans around the Spring Festival. This, coupled with the 96.9 million jin of grain allocated by the Central People's Government for the Huai River levee repair project, implemented a "work-for-relief" program. Recently, the East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee allocated another 20 million jin of grain for emergency relief to Northern Anhui. The Northern Anhui Production and Disaster Relief Committee also launched a comprehensive social mutual aid campaign during the Spring Festival, raising over 3.128 billion yuan in disaster relief donations from all sectors in cities such as Shanghai, Bengbu, Hefei, and Anqing, as well as over 2.5 million jin of rice. The 309 non-disaster-stricken townships also donated over 2.7 billion yuan and over 880,000 jin of grain, and over 2,000 pieces of clothing. These grains and funds played a significant role in stabilizing and alleviating the development of the disaster situation in the region, laying a sufficient material foundation for the entire production and disaster relief movement.

After the production and disaster relief movement was universally launched in various places, in addition to generally promoting and organizing disaster victims to help themselves through various representative conferences, the production and disaster relief committees at all levels also focused on carrying out the work of supply and marketing cooperatives. Through supply and marketing cooperatives, they vigorously supported and organized disaster victims to engage in sideline production and supply the needs of disaster victims. The local product sales company in the area and its nine county branches and seventeen sub-branches purchased a total of 138,000 jin of sideline products such as vermicelli, soybean oil, and sesame oil from disaster victims in two months, as well as 120,000 chi of homespun cloth. They also lent 500,000 jin of edible salt to disaster victims and sold a large amount of grain at fair prices. With the support of the supply and marketing cooperatives, nearly 10,000 various sideline production cooperatives and production mutual aid groups were organized throughout the area. In Xiao County (formerly under Jiangsu, now under the jurisdiction of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office) alone, there were 856 large and small sideline production cooperatives and more than 2,200 production mutual aid groups, with as many as 75 types of sideline production. The county can maintain the lives of more than 43,000 people through sideline production alone. Coupled with work-for-relief levee repairs and social mutual assistance, the 100,000 food-deprived disaster victims in the county can survive the spring famine. In the severely affected counties of Dangshan, Yongcheng, Su County, Lingbi, Si County, and Wuhe, with the focused support of local people's governments and the promotion and assistance of supply and marketing cooperatives, disaster victims were enabled to engage in sideline production, which also initially laid the foundation for self-reliance through production.

Although the disaster situation in Northern Anhui has stabilized, 60 percent of the 1.4 million mu of wheat seedlings in the region, which were submerged by rain and snow, urgently need drainage and rescue or replanting with early-maturing crops. The ideological complacency and reliance on relief among individual cadres, as well as the tendency to focus solely on emergency relief in severely affected areas while neglecting preparatory work in lightly affected areas, have not been completely overcome. Currently, the leading organs in the region are combining efforts to vigorously organize spring plowing and production to correct the above-mentioned deviations.

    各方运拨粮食三亿余斤打下生产救灾物质基础
    为急救断炊户和扶助灾民进行生产，皖北行署春节前后又拨出数达一亿九千万斤的救济粮和副业生产贷粮，加上中央人民政府拨给该区的修复江淮干堤工程费的粮食九千六百九十万斤，实行以工代赈。最近华东生产救灾委员会又拨给皖北急赈粮二千万斤。皖北生产救灾委员会并于春节期间发起了全面的社会互济运动，在上海、蚌埠、合肥、安庆等城市募得各界救灾捐款人民币三十一亿二千八百余万元、大米二百五十余万斤。非灾区三百零九个乡并捐助人民币二十七亿余元，粮八十八万余斤，衣物二千余件。这些粮款对于稳定与缓和该区灾情发展上起了很大作用，给整个生产救灾运动打下了充分的物质基础。
    当生产救灾运动在各地普遍展开后，各级生产救灾委员会除普遍通过各种代表会议推动与组织灾民生产自救外，并抓紧了开展供销合作社的工作。通过供销合作社大力扶助与组织灾民进行副业生产和供应灾民需要。该区土产运销公司及其下设的九个县社、十七个分社，在两个月内共收购灾民粉丝、豆油、麻油等副业产品达十三万八千斤、土布十二万尺，并贷给灾民食盐五十万斤及平粜了大批粮食。在供销合作社的扶助下，全区共组织起各种副业生产合作社和生产互助组近一万个。仅萧县（原属江苏，现划归皖北行署管辖）组织起来的大小副业生产合作社即有八百五十六个，生产互助组二千二百余个，各种副业生产的种类有七十五种之多。该县以副业生产即可维持四万三千多人的生活，再加以工代赈修堤、社会互济等，该县十万断炊灾民可以渡过春荒。砀山、永城、宿县、灵璧、泗县、五河等灾重县份，在各地人民政府有重点地支援与供销合作社推动扶助下，使灾民进行副业生产，亦初步奠立了生产自救的基础。
    目前皖北灾情虽趋稳定，但全区遭雨雪淹没的一百四十万亩麦苗，尚有百分之六十急待排水抢救或补种早熟庄稼。个别干部中思想上麻痹及依赖救济、单注意重灾区急救忽视轻灾区的备荒工作等偏向尚未完全克服。现该区领导机关正结合大力组织春耕生产，纠正上述偏向。
