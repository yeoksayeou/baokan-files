　　Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: A comprehensive report from TASS and the Polish Press Agency states: The movement to complete production plans ahead of schedule is widely unfolding in Poland, with workers in all industries participating in this movement.
    The achievements of the miners are particularly outstanding. For example, the work teams in the Gravitz mine have exceeded their norms by 112% or 124%. The staff and workers of the Smiley mine have guaranteed to complete the 1950 plan in nine months. By March 20th, the excavation workers of the mine had over-fulfilled the coal excavation plan by 12,000 tons.
    In March, Polish miners excavated an average of 17,000 tons of coal per day more than in the fourth quarter of 1949. The coal mining industry exceeded the March plan by 5.2%, producing a total of more than seven million tons of coal in March. This is the highest figure since the liberation of Poland. The peat industry exceeded the plan by 30% in February.
    In the Florian metallurgical factory, the work team led by Banusik completed the first quarter plan in February. It is now fulfilling the second quarter guarantee. Polish railway workers have also participated in the movement to complete production plans ahead of schedule. Thirty-two railway worker teams in Olsztyn participated in the competition, one of which guaranteed that their locomotives would travel 80,000 kilometers without any repairs. Three locomotive driver teams in Poznan achieved a running speed of 715 kilometers per 24 hours, setting an unprecedented record in Poland.
    In agriculture, the Farmers' Mutual Aid Union has formulated new regulations to carry out labor emulation between planting groups and animal husbandry groups, rationalization workers, and innovators. The Farmers' Mutual Aid Union will also encourage competition for new tasks such as land reclamation and afforestation, and long-term labor emulation to increase the planting area of wheat, barley, and industrial crops.
