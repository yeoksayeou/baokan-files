　　Hainan Frontline Dispatch
    The Night of a Thousand Sails Crossing the Sea
    Shǐ Yē

    On the evening of April 16th, the main force of the People's Liberation Army set sail in a mighty fleet, heading straight for Hainan Island. The weather that day changed particularly quickly. In the morning, a southwest wind still blew from the sea, but by noon it had turned into a southeast wind. Around 2 PM, the southwest corner of the sky was covered with dark clouds, thunder rumbled, and then a violent south wind began to blow, with waves in the sea rising high and violently crashing against the shore. The headquarters had already issued an order: the troops were to temporarily board the ships and stand by. The soldiers couldn't help but become anxious, each worried that the crossing operation that night would be forced to be postponed.

    After a large storm surge passed, a gentle breeze slowly blew from the southeast. Then, the order to board the ships came. Small barges and sampans carried the troops gathered on the beach to the large sailing ships for the crossing, one trip after another. Some soldiers couldn't wait and took off their clothes, carrying their backpacks on their heads, and waded through the water to board the ships. After everyone was on board, loud military music rose from the shore, sending off the warriors. The soldiers on the ships, seeing the huge statue of Chairman Mao held high in the distance, clapped their hands excitedly and said with smiles, "Look! Chairman Mao is also here to see us off." The soldiers shouted out thunderous slogans with indescribable excitement, harmonizing with the sound of the ocean waves.

    In the dim night sky, the signal to set sail rose brilliantly. Countless ships on the sea spread out in battle formation, heading towards the designated direction. Although the southeast wind blowing on the sea was not quite right, the sailing ships still raised their sails to the fullest and advanced against the waves towards the southwest.

    After sailing for more than twenty miles, the sound of engines came from far to near in the sky, and flares illuminated the vast sea. Several enemy planes circled and scouted. Enemy warships patrolling the sea also discovered our ships and began firing their cannons. Our gunboats immediately bravely advanced to meet them. A fierce artillery battle began between the two sides. The echoes of the cannons roared like spring thunder. Fearing to expose their targets, the enemy warships dared not use searchlights, only firing flares. The cowardly enemy warships, in order to avoid the bombardment of our gunboats, even tried to insert themselves into the middle of the large fleet; but under the threat of the concentrated firepower of each ship, they had no choice but to scurry to the distant sea and blindly fire. Each fleet broke through the enemy warships' obstruction and advanced in mutual support. At this time, a strong east wind blew on the sea, carrying hundreds of wooden boats with their sails full, speeding across the main currents of the ocean.

    Suddenly, the sea breeze stopped, the wooden boats moved slowly, and the enemy warships took the opportunity to rush over and bombard us frantically. Some of the sail ropes were broken, some of the sails were pierced, and some of the ship bottoms were holed. But the brave and unparalleled soldiers calmly responded without panic, on one hand organizing firepower to counterattack, and on the other hand, exerting themselves to row forward. Cadres, soldiers, boatmen, and sailors encouraged each other: "We're almost to the shore, work hard!" In this way, our fleet sailed for more than twenty miles while fighting the enemy warships. At this time, the quiet seawater stirred up layers of waves, and the wind rose again. Countless sails were raised on the sea again, and the wooden boats sped forward with the wind, following the waves.

    At three o'clock in the middle of the night, our powerful fleet had approached the coast of Qiongya. The defending enemy used all kinds of artillery fire and light and heavy machine guns to form a web of fire, blocking the sea. The covering fire from each ship also began to counterattack at the same time. The flares fired by the enemy and the signal flares fired from the ships cut through the pitch-black night sky. The thousands of masts of the landing ships illuminated by the enemy warships' searchlights looked like a forest without leaves emerging from the sea. Lingao Cape, illuminated by flares, searchlights, and signal flares, was clearly laid out before our eyes.

    Our landing forces defeated the enemy's front and rear attacks and quickly broke through the enemy's coastal defense lines on the left and right sides of Lingao Cape, occupied the beachhead positions, and by 6:30, had completed the entire successful landing.

    An inspection revealed that no ships had fallen behind. One sailing ship that had been trapped on the beach at the time of departure also arrived after our army had completely landed. Only the enemy warship "Submarine Chaser No. 1," which had hindered our army's advance, was lying obliquely on the sea off Lingao Cape after being damaged by our artillery fire.

    千帆渡海之夜
    史耶
    四月十六日晚，解放军渡海主力部队浩浩荡荡地启航，直指海南岛。这一天的天气变化得特别快，早晨从海面上还吹来一阵阵的西南风，到中午便转为东南风了。下午二时光景，西南角的上空乌云密布，雷声隆隆，接着又刮起暴烈的南风，海里的波涛卷起很高的浪头，猛烈地冲激着海岸。指挥部已发出命令：部队暂上上船，停着待命。战士们不由得焦急起来，个个都担心着今晚渡海行动会被迫延期。
    一阵大风浪过去，东南方徐徐吹来微风。接着，上船的命令传来了。小驳船和舢板船一趟又一趟地把聚集在海滩上的部队载到渡海的大帆船上去。有些战士等不及了，便脱光衣服，头顶着背包，涉水登船。上完船后，岸上扬起欢送勇士们的响亮的军乐声。船上的战士们，遥遥望见高举着的毛主席巨像，一齐兴奋地拍手笑着说：“瞧！毛主席也给咱们送行来了。”战士们以难言的兴奋一齐喊出了雄浑的口号，与海涛声相和。
    昏暗的夜空，灿然升起了启航的讯号。海面上无数船只摆开了战斗队形，朝着指定的方向驶去。海上吹着的东南风，虽然不很对劲，风船却一样地扯起满帆，向西南方破浪前进。
    船行二十余里，天空中马达声自远而近，辽阔的海面上闪耀着照明弹，数架匪机在盘旋侦察。巡逻在海上的敌舰也发现了我们的船只，通通地打起炮来。我们的炮艇随即奋勇向前迎击。双方开始了一场激烈的炮战。炮声的回声像春雷似地轰响着。敌舰怕暴露目标，不敢使用探照灯，只是打着照明弹。胆怯的敌舰为了躲开我炮艇的轰击，曾插到大航队中间；但在各船密集火力的威胁下，又只好窜到远远的海面上盲目地射击。各航队冲破敌舰的阻挡，相互呼应地前进。这时海上东风大作，将扯满风帆的千百只木船，疾驰过海洋的主流。
    突然，海风停了，木船迟迟不前，敌舰即乘机赶来疯狂地开炮轰击。有的船篷绳被打断了，有的帆被打穿了，有的被打漏了船底。但英勇无比的战士们，毫不惊慌地沉着应战，一面组织火力反击，一面使劲摇橹前进。干部、战士、船工、水手互助鼓励着：“快到岸了，努力干！”就这样，我们的船队和敌舰边打边进下航行了二十多里。这时，静静的海水掀起了一层层的波浪，风又起了。海面上顿时又扬起无数道风帆，木船顺着风势，随着浪涛飞速地前进。
    午夜三时，我强大航队已逼近琼崖海岸。守敌以各种炮火和轻重机枪组成一片火网，封锁着海面。各船的掩护火力也一齐开始反击。敌人打出的照明弹和船上发出的信号弹，划破了漆黑的夜空。在敌舰探照灯照射下的登陆船只的千百根桅杆，就像从海里冒出来的一片没有树叶的森林。照明弹、探照灯、信号弹照耀下的临高角，清清楚楚地摆在眼前。
    我登陆部队击溃敌人的前后夹攻，很快地突破了临高角左右两面的敌人海防线，占领了滩头阵地，到六点半钟，即全部胜利登陆完毕。
    检查所有船只无一掉队。在起航时被陷在沙滩上的一只风船，也在我军全部登陆后赶来了。只有阻扰我军前进的敌舰“驱潜一号”，被我炮火打坏后斜躺在临高角的海面上。
