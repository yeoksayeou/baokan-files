Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 12th: The various units of the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army, in conjunction with the production campaign, are vigorously helping farmers with spring plowing, carrying out mass work, and resolutely suppressing the activities of remaining bandits and special agents.

The troops stationed in Qinghai help the local poor masses with voluntary labor for half a day to a day each week. A certain unit instructed its subordinates not to compete with the people for land or forcibly buy seeds during production, strictly prohibited mobilizing civilian labor, and forbade trampling on young seedlings. It also called on its subordinates to publicize the significance of labor creating wealth and the army's participation in production to the masses, achieving "everyone publicizes, everyone speaks." In order to understand the situation in a timely manner and handle relations with the masses well, the unit also stipulated that mass discipline be checked once a week. The troops stationed in Luntai, Xinjiang, jointly formed a water conservancy committee with the government and farmers, resolving years of water disputes and establishing the principle of "irrigate distant lands first, then nearby lands; irrigate the poor first, then the rich; irrigate the masses first, then the army," which the local residents are extremely satisfied with. A certain unit of the Lanzhou garrison helped local people repair a canal that could irrigate 500 mu of gardens in eight days. More than 2,000 people from a directly subordinate team of a certain corps in Xi'an helped farmers cultivate more than 700 mu of land. In order to ensure that the troops have strong production enthusiasm and do not infringe upon the interests of the masses, temporary CCP party branches have been established in all production units to strengthen leadership.

When entering the production front, all units paid close attention to suppressing the opportunistic activities of bandits and special agents. Taking the troops stationed in Qinghai as an example, after each unit entered the production area, they first built fortifications and carried out production while carrying weapons. When opening up wasteland and camping, they sent out guard troops to carry out guard duties, and the cooking staff staying in the villages also organized to strengthen security. In March, a certain unit not only completed the production tasks for that month, but also eliminated more than 800 bandits and special agents.

Regarding the troops' hygiene, health work, and cultural studies, all units have also actively launched them in conjunction with the great production campaign.

　　结合生产展开群众工作
    一野各部大力助民春耕
    坚决镇压匪特乘隙活动
    【新华社兰州十二日电】人民解放军第一野战军各部结合生产运动，大力帮助农民春耕、展开群众工作并坚决镇压残余土匪特务的活动。
    青海驻军每周帮助驻地贫苦群众义务劳动半天到一天；某部指示所部在生产中不许与民争地、强买籽种，严禁动员民力，不准踏青苗，并号召所属向群众宣传劳动致富和部队参加生产的意义，做到“人人宣传、个个开口”。为及时了解情况，处理好群众关系，该部并规定每周检查一次群众纪律。新疆轮台驻军与政府、农民合组水利委员会，解决了多年的水利纠纷，确定了“远地先浇、近地后浇，贫者先浇、富者后浇，群众先浇、军队后浇”的原则，当地居民极为满意。兰州市驻军某部，在八天内协助当地群众修好一条可灌溉五百亩园地的水渠。西安市某兵团直属队两千余人，帮助农民耕地七百余亩。各生产单位为保证部队有旺盛的生产情绪和不侵犯群众利益，都成立临时的中共党支部，以加强领导。
    各单位在进入生产阵地时，都密切注意镇压土匪特务的乘隙活动。以青海驻军为例，各部进入生产地带后，首先做好工事，携带武器进行生产；在开荒和宿营时，均派出警戒部队作警卫工作，留在村中的炊事人员也组织起来，加强戒备。某部在三月份内不仅完成了该月的生产任务，而且还消灭了八百多土匪特务。
    关于部队的卫生、健康工作和文化学习，各部队也都结合着大生产运动积极展开。
