　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a Powerful Guarantee for Our Country's Construction

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 12th] Vice Chairman Song Qingling of the Central People's Government recently issued a statement on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assitance, stating:

　　The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Frienship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is the most powerful guarantee for the construction of a New Democratic New China. It gives the enemy a heavy blow, exceeding the power of the atomic bomb. It enables us to achieve true democracy and world peace.

　　As far as I know, before the July 7th Incident, the Soviet Union once proposed to China to sign a non-aggression treaty. If we had accepted this suggestion at that time, Japanese imperialism would not have dared to invade us, the lives of millions of compatriots could have been spared from sacrifice, and the land of our motherland could have been spared from devastation. However, the Chinese reactionaries rejected this goodwill proposal, causing us more than ten years of bloodshed and sacrifice, hindering our construction and progress.

　　Today, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with our friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union, which enables our country's war wounds to be quickly recovered and guarantees our country's construction. China's bright future is unfolding before us.

　　宋副主席发表谈话
    中苏友好同盟互助条约是我国建设的有力保证
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府宋庆龄副主席顷就中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立发表谈话称：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立，是新民主主义新中国建设的最有力的保证。它给敌人以沉重的打击，超过了原子弹的力量。它使我们能够达到真正的民主与世界和平。
    据我所知道的，在七七事变前，苏联曾经建议和中国订立互不侵犯条约。如果在那时候我们接受了这个建议，日本帝国主义就不敢侵犯我们，千百万同胞的生命可以免遭牺牲，祖国的大地可以免遭蹂躏。但是，中国的反动派拒绝了这善意的建议，使我们遭受十多年的流血和牺牲，阻碍了我们的建设和进步。
    今天，在英明的毛主席的领导下，我们和友邦苏联签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，使我国的战争创伤可以迅速恢复，使我国的建设得到了保证。中国的光明前途已在前面展开了。
