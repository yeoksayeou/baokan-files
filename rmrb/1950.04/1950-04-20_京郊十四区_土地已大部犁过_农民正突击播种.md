　　Fourteen Districts of Beijing Suburbs:
    Most of the Land Has Been Plowed, Farmers Are Rushing to Sow Seeds
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Most of the land in the fourteen districts of Beijing suburbs has been plowed, and farmers are rushing to sow seeds. In Yinghai Village, Zhiyuan Village, and five other villages, as of April 3rd, 50,321 mu of land had been plowed (out of a total of 52,681 mu). The remaining unplowed river depressions and wetlands will soon be dried and plowed. During plowing, most farmers are carrying out mutual assistance based on the existing work exchange customs and the principle of mutual benefit and voluntarism. Party members and Youth League members have played a backbone and leading role in the work exchange. In Yinghai Village, ten groups with a total of forty-nine people are exchanging labor. All 13,030 mu of land in the village has been completely plowed. In Erbaozi, a natural village of Shibalidian, six households with thirteen laborers, both male and female, exchanged labor and rushed to sow three mu of kidney beans, eleven mu of millet, two and a half mu of corn, and one mu of sorghum in two days. The district production work team discovered that some poor households were unable to plow. They have now initiated work exchanges between poor households providing labor and households with livestock providing animal power. Poor households with grass are using grass to exchange for animal power. Now, the labor for substitute plowing is converted into wages, which will be repaid after the autumn harvest.
    [Another Dispatch] Some villages in the fourteen districts are rushing to plant trees. The entire village of Yinghai has planted 8,450 trees. Zhongnong Liu Zhenting's household planted more than 300 trees. Shibalidian plans to plant 500 trees.

　　京郊十四区
    土地已大部犁过  农民正突击播种
    【本报讯】京郊十四区大部土地已犁完，农民们正在突击播种。瀛海庄、志远庄等七村，截至四月三日，已犁地五万零三百二十一亩（共有土地五万二千六百八十一亩）。还未犁过的河洼湿地，不久即可晒干开犁。在犁地时农民大部在旧有的拨工习惯上及自愿两利的原则下进行拨工互助。党员团员在拨工上起了骨干带头作用。瀛海庄现有十个组共四十九人拨换工，全村一万三千零三十亩土地已完全犁过。十八里店自然村二堡子有六户男女十三个劳力，拨工两天突击播种芸豆三亩、谷子十一亩、玉米二亩半、高粱一亩。区生产工作组曾发现有些贫苦户无力耕犁，现已发起贫苦户以劳力和有牲畜户的畜力的拨工，贫苦户有草的，用草换畜力工。现在把代耕劳力折成工资，秋后偿还。
    【又讯】十四区某些村庄正突击栽树。瀛海庄全村已植树八千四百五十棵，中农刘振廷一户栽了三百多棵。十八里店计划植树五百棵。
