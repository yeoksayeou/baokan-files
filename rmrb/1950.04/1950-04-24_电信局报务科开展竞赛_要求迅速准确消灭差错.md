Telecommunications Bureau Telegraph Office Launches Competition to Rapidly and Accurately Eliminate Errors

[This newspaper's dispatch] Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's Telegraph Office, in order to respond to the call from the All-China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union National Member Representative Assembly regarding "eliminating errors," and with the guarantee and support of administrative leading cadres, the Enterprise Management Committee, the CCP branch, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League branch, launched a work competition movement on the 15th of this month with the goal of being rapid, accurate, and eliminating errors. Prior to this competition movement, various departments of the bureau had already engaged in various small-scale competitions. For example, Zhang Ruifu's broadcasting team in the first section of the Telegraph Office took the lead in initiating an error reduction week, which had a very good effect. Errors occurred as many as thirteen times in January, but were reduced to three in February. In March, the competition movement of "striving to be the group with the fewest errors" was further launched among the four groups. At the end of the month's summary, the errors of the entire broadcasting group were reduced by 40% compared to February (74 errors in February, reduced to 29 in March). Zhang Guowei's group, which won the victory, completely eliminated major errors in the second half of March, with only one small pasting error. The bureau's deliverymen also launched a movement of groups and individuals making plans to strive to eliminate errors. Deliveryman Bai Baolong proposed the "Four Looks for Delivery" method, that is, when receiving the delivery slip, delivering it to the user, receiving the receipt, and returning the receipt, one must carefully look at it once to check for errors. This method was promoted and publicized, and has been officially implemented since March 20th. Up to now, there has not been a single error.
The deliverymen also conducted an eight-day "delivery blitz competition." In this blitz competition, in addition to ensuring that no major errors were made, work efficiency was also improved. For example, Bai Baolong's group delivered an average of 3.1 telegrams per person per day in March, which increased to 5.8 in April. Group member Zhai Xianglin delivered a total of 31 telegrams in the eight days from March 5th to 12th, while from April 5th to 12th, he delivered as many as 50 telegrams. Delivering a Xinhua News Agency telegram, a round trip of twenty li, was originally scheduled for sixty minutes. He once made the round trip in twenty-eight minutes. This movement has enabled all deliverymen to leave immediately upon receiving a telegram, eliminating the backlog of telegrams. In the past, some deliverymen only liked to take telegrams with nearby routes, but now they are competing to take telegrams with far routes; in the past, when handing in cards in sequence, they hoped to be called upon later, but now everyone is quickly competing to hand in cards first, striving to deliver one more telegram.

　　电信局报务科开展竞赛  要求迅速准确消灭差错
    【本报讯】北京电信局报务科为了响应中国邮电工会全国会员代表大会关于“消灭差错”的号召，在行政领导干部、企业管理委员会、中共支部、工会及青年团支部的保证和支持下，于本月十五日展开以迅速、准确、消灭差错为目标的工作竞赛运动。在此次竞赛运动以前，该局各部已有过各种小型的竞赛，如报务科一股广播小组张瑞符组首先发起了减少错误运动周，收效很好，一月份出差错十三次之多，二月份则减少到三件。三月份更进一步在四个小组间展开了“争取错误最少的一组”的竞赛运动，月终总结时，全广播组的差错比二月份减少了百分之四十（二月份七十四件，三月份减少到二十九件）。获得胜利的张国维组在三月下半月更做到了完全消灭大错，仅出了一个粘贴的小错。该局送报员也开展了小组订计划和个人订计划，争取消灭差错的运动。送报员白葆珑提出了“送报四看”的办法，即领到报单、交到用户、收到回执，交回回执的时候都要细看一次，检查是否有错误。这办法经推广和宣传，由三月二十日起正式实行以来，到现在为止，没有发生过一件差错。
    送报员还进行了八天的“送报突击竞赛”。这次突击竞赛中，除作到了没出大错外，工作效率也有所提高，如白葆珑小组三月份平均每人每日送报三·一次，四月份增至五·八次。组员翟祥林在三月五日至十二日八天中共送报三十一次，而四月五日至十二日则送报达五十次。送新华社电报，来回二十里，原定时间为六十分钟。他有一次却在二十八分钟内打了来回。这一运动使全体送报员做到有了电报即走，消灭了电报积压现象。过去有些送报员只欢喜拿路近的报，现在却争着拿路远的报；过去交牌顺次序时希望慢些轮到自己，现在大家都很快的争先交牌，争取多送一次报。（北京电信局通讯组）
