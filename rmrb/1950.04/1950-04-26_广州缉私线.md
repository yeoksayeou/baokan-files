    Exactly how many people in Guangzhou rely on smuggling for a living is not yet precisely known. Here is a province-wide figure that may help in understanding the Guangzhou situation. According to statistics from the Provincial Tax Bureau, 1.5 million people in Guangdong province depend on smuggling to survive. On the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, over ten thousand people are constantly going back and forth across the border, engaged exclusively in smuggling. Guangzhou is the economic center of the province, and also the economic center of South China, so the serious problem of smuggling is reflected very clearly here.
    In Guangdong, smuggling has a long history and has become a mass phenomenon. The figure of 1.5 million people clearly illustrates this point. These people are very familiar with the geography of Guangdong, possess a large number of weapons, and operate out of the complicated coastal and riverine inlets, making it relatively easy to evade capture. Guangdong is close to Hong Kong and Macau, making it very convenient to engage in smuggling. A group of people who have completely lost their means of livelihood are forced to take this path, and over time, they have come to regard it as a profession. For decades, the Kuomintang bandit gang engaged in "anti-smuggling" on the one hand, and accepted bribes to protect smugglers on the other; some "military and political bigwigs" were themselves major smugglers. As a result, smuggling spread throughout the province, and the Pearl River Delta was particularly serious. The Kuomintang left behind this mess, which is already troublesome enough; and when they collapsed and retreated, they sent a group of bandits and special agents to infiltrate this industry, specifically to sabotage our taxation. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Tax Bureau attaches great importance to this issue and is using various methods to overcome it.
    Now, Guangzhou has made great strides in this work.
    In January and February, the tax revenue increased in Guangzhou City due to anti-smuggling, including back taxes and fines, totaled 33,086,734 yuan. An average of one case of smuggling was detected per day. In March, the tax revenue increased due to anti-smuggling surged to 1,120,447,930 yuan, with an average of eight cases of smuggling detected per day. The tax revenue increased in March due to the seizure of illicit alcohol was equivalent to 730,000 catties of rice, which is sixteen times the city's total alcohol tax revenue for March. This figure proves the severity of the smuggling problem and also demonstrates the significant progress made in anti-smuggling work in March.
    The great achievements in March benefited from improvements in working methods. The main problem with anti-smuggling work in February was a lack of planning. At the beginning of March, a full-month plan was formulated, a weekly work schedule was stipulated, and a system of daily and weekly summaries was implemented to check the progress of work at any time. In specific practices, the principle of "grasping the small ones and pursuing the big ones" was strictly adopted. In the past, staff members were busy all day long, running here and there, and only seized smuggled goods from small merchants, while large smuggling merchants could cunningly escape our eyes. Now, the small smuggling merchants are used as clues to track down the large smuggling merchants, and as a result, a large number of smuggled goods were seized from five major companies, including the Golden Star Match Factory. In the past, staff also lacked organization, and there were more scattered and individual activities, and the raids also lacked focus and targets. In March, the staff was divided into groups of two to three people, areas were designated, and patrols were dispatched regularly. If important clues were found in a certain area, several groups were concentrated to raid the major tax evaders. Smugglers often unload goods when inspectors are resting, and the time varies, so patrols were always on duty in key areas, regardless of rest periods or Sundays. In terms of inspection methods, March also saw improvements over the previous period. Originally, some merchants often used old tax tickets or borrowed other people's tax tickets to deceive us. Our method is to first clarify the merchants in each district, and then conduct inspections with a focus. For example, when inspecting illicit alcohol, we first clarify the alcohol merchants and launch a general census to prevent mutual substitution. At the same time, each tax ticket is stamped with a verification seal to avoid repeated use. As a result, a considerable number of loopholes have been plugged.
    It should be admitted that our anti-smuggling work has just begun, experience is limited, and not many problems have been identified. Moreover, the work throughout March focused more on inspection and less on extensive policy publicity and education. The Municipal Tax Bureau intends to make up for these shortcomings in future work and actively carry out inspections of factories, fields, warehouses, and general markets to strive for greater achievements.

　　广州缉私线
    萧航
    广州究竟有多少人靠走私吃饭，眼下还没有确实材料可资查考。这里有一个全省的数字，对于了解广州情况，不无帮助。根据省税务局的统计，广东有一百五十万人依靠走私过日子。在广九线上，为数逾万的一批人，整天在边界上来来往往，专干走私生涯。广州是全省的经济中心，也是华南的经济中心，严重的走私问题，在这里反映得很鲜明。
    在广东，走私有着久远的历史，而且还是带群众性的。一百五十万人的数字，正好说明这一点。这些人非常熟悉广东的地理，拥有大量的武器，依托沿海沿江的纷杂港汊活动，因此比较容易逃避缉捕。广东贴近香港、澳门，搞私货十分方便。有一批完全失去生活依据的人，被迫走上这条道路，久而久之，就当成职业来做了。几十年来，国民党匪帮一面“缉私”，一面接受贿赂，包庇走私；有些“军政大员”，自己就是大走私者。于是走私范围遍及全省，珠江三角洲更显得严重。国民党把这个烂摊子丢下来，已经够麻烦了；而他们在溃退的时候，又派遣了一批土匪特务混进这一行，专门破坏我们的税务。因此，广东省税务局十分重视这个问题，正用种种办法克服它。
    现在，广州市在这一工作中已经大大前进了一步。
    在一、二两月份中，广州市因缉私而增加的税款，包括补税、罚款在内，共有三千三百零八万六千七百三十四元。每日平均查获走私货物一宗。三月份因缉私而增收的税款，骤增至十一亿二千零四十四万七千九百三十元，每日平均查获走私货物八宗。三月份因查获私酒而增收的税款，折米七十三万斤，等于三月份全市所征酒税税款的十六倍。这个数字足证走私问题的严重，也说明三月份的缉私工作有了很大进步。
    三月份的巨大成绩，得助于工作方法的改进。二月份缉私工作的主要毛病是无计划。三月份一开始就拟定了全月计划，规定了每周工作的进度表，执行了每日总结、每周总结的制度，随时检查工作的进行。在具体作法上，则严格采取了“抓紧小的，追寻大的”的原则。过去，工作人员终日忙忙碌碌，东跑西跑，只查获了些小商的走私货物，而走私大商，却能狡猾地逃开我们的眼睛。现在是以走私小商作线索，追寻走私的大商，结果查获了金星火柴厂等五家的大批私货。以往，工作人员也缺乏组织，分散的个别的活动较多，突击也没有重点和目标。三月里，把工作人员分编为二——三人的若干小组，划定地区，经常出动查缉。如果在某一地区发现了重要线索，就把若干组集中起来，去突击大的偷漏分子。走私商常常乘缉检人员休息时才起卸货物，并且时间早晚不定，所以不论休息时间或星期日，凡是重点地区总有人放哨巡缉。在检查方法上，三月份也较前有了改进。原来有些商人常常利用旧税票或借用别人的税票来瞒混我们。我们采取的办法是：先把各区的商户弄得清清楚楚，然后有重点地进行检查。例如检查私酒的时候，就先把酒商搞清楚，发动普查，借以防止互相顶替。同时，每检查一张税票，就加盖验章，免得重复使用。这一来，有相当一部分漏洞是给堵塞住了。
    应该承认，我们的缉私工作还刚刚开始，经验有限，发现的问题还不多。而且整个三月份的工作，偏重于缉检者多，进行广泛的政策宣传教育不够。市税务局打算在今后的工作中弥补这些缺点，并积极开展厂、场、仓库及一般市场的检查工作，争取作出更大的成绩。
