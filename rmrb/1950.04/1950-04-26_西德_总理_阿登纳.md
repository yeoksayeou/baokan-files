　　The entire life story of Adenauer, the "Chancellor" of the West German puppet government, is a record of speculation, opportunism, baseness, and filth.

　　During the time of Kaiser Wilhelm II, he served as the mayor of Cologne, and later as a member of the Prussian House of Lords. In 1919, he even participated in the conspiracy to organize the "Independent Rhineland Republic."

　　Afterwards, he became an admirer of Hitler and Mussolini. He praised Mussolini as "the most glorious figure in Catholic history."

　　Adenauer was one of the leaders of the reactionary Catholicism in the Rhineland, and he vigorously supported the propaganda of Hitler's fascism. In 1927, he made a big fuss about the Nazis' "living space" theory, saying: "The Greater German Reich must obtain colonies at any cost. For its large population, the German Reich is too small."

　　He served as an assistant to the Nazi boss Brüning and paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. When he was Chairman of the Prussian State Council, he helped Göring to fascize Prussia. In 1942, when Adenauer's financial fraud case was exposed, Göring personally ordered a ban on the investigation to cover it up and repay his assistance.

　　After the Second World War, he transformed himself into an "anti-fascist." He gathered some extremely reactionary elements to form the "Christian Democratic Union" and became its leader. On July 13, 1945, he told a United Press reporter that he strongly supported the "long-term occupation" of Germany and supported the American occupation authorities' "occupation regulations," "moving the capital to Bonn," "American imperialist supervision of armed West Germany," and a series of reactionary policies such as "American monopoly capital controlling the Ruhr industry."

　　Adenauer is one of the directors of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank, and also serves as a director of Germany's four major monopoly companies. As early as 1920, he became an important intermediary for American capital to infiltrate Germany. And an even more important fact is that the current U.S. High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy (an American banker), is Adenauer's brother-in-law.

　　This is why Adenauer was chosen to be the "Chancellor of the Bonn government" and why he dared to openly lead the singing of the "Nazi national anthem."

### 西德“总理”阿登纳

　　西德“总理”阿登纳
    西德傀儡政府“总理”阿登纳的全部生活史，就是一部投机、取巧、卑鄙、龌龊的记录。
    在德皇威廉二世时代，他当过柯罗克的市长，后来又当过普鲁士上议院的议员。一九一九年他还参加过组织“独立莱茵共和国”的阴谋活动。
    此后，他即成为希特勒、墨索里尼的崇拜者。他恭维墨索里尼为“天主教历史中最辉煌的人物”。
    阿登纳是莱茵区反动天主教的领袖之一，他极力支持希特勒法西斯的宣传。一九二七年，他曾为纳粹的“生存空间”学说大事吹擂，他说：“大德意志帝国必须不惜以任何代价取得殖民地。对它的众多的人口来说，德意志帝国是太小了。”
    他充当纳粹头子布鲁宁的助手，并为希特勒的上台铺平道路。在他任普鲁士邦务会议主席时，帮助过戈林使普鲁士法西斯化。一九四二年，阿登纳的财政舞弊案被揭发时，戈林私人下令禁止调查，为之遮掩耳目，报答他的援助。
    第二次世界大战以后，他又摇身一变成为“反法西斯”人士了。他纠集了一些极端反动分子组成“基督教民主联盟”，并成为它的领袖。他在一九四五年七月十三日曾对合众社记者表示过竭力赞成“长期占领”德国，并支持美国占领当局的“占领法规”，“迁都波恩”，“美帝监督武装西德”和“美独占资本控制鲁尔工业”等一系列的反动政策。
    阿登纳是德意志银行的监察会理事之一，又身兼德国四大独占公司的理事，早在一九二○年，他就成了美国资本渗入德国的重要牵线人。而更重要的一桩事实就是：现任美国驻西德的高级专员麦克洛埃（美国的银行家）与阿登纳是连襟。
    这就是为什么阿登纳会被捧出来当“波恩政府总理”，为什么他胆敢公开领唱“纳粹国歌”的道理。
