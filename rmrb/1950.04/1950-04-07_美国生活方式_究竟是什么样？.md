　　What Exactly is the "American Way of Life"?
　　Mei Hao Shi

　　The mouthpieces of American imperialism are constantly peddling the "American way of life." What exactly does the "American way of life" look like? This article is based on a writer's conversation about his experiences in the United States, after living there for many years, and it can help answer this question.

　　Americans have always boasted of their democracy. But it may be unbelievable to say that it is not a democratic country in law. The American Constitution only stipulates that the United States is a republic and does not stipulate that it is a democratic country. Recently, some Democrats in the southern United States shouted in Congress: "The United States is a republic, not a democracy."

　　The population of several states in the southern United States is two million, but less than ten thousand people participate in the election of senators. In many areas, blacks and poor whites are deprived of their right to vote because they cannot afford to pay the poll tax. There is a law in Alabama that stipulates that the election committee has the right to ask voters to interpret the Constitution. Those who cannot interpret the Constitution have no right to vote. These committee masters certainly will not ask white voters to interpret it; they only ask blacks to interpret it. Once, an election committee asked a black voter to explain a question on the Constitution. The black man could not answer, and of course, he was deprived of his right to vote. Later, they gave this question to the dean of the law school of the state university to study. The doctor of law studied it for three days before making an answer. This answer said: "This question cannot be answered."

　　Some people say that the United States is a Protestant country, but in recent years, Catholicism has flourished and has become overwhelmingly powerful. As is well known, the church is an indispensable part of American life, especially in small towns and villages. In these small towns and villages, the only things that Americans can use to relieve boredom are radio, movies, bars, and churches. Churches sometimes have fashion shows, dances, speeches, and a type of gambling called Bingo. Those who win money have to give 15 percent to God as a cut. For the church, this is a considerable income. So, when New York State passed a bill banning Bingo, pastors of all factions stood up to oppose it, and the bill was repealed as a result.

　　The most reactionary religion in the United States is Catholicism. The head of the Vatican in the United States is named Spellman. He once mobilized Catholic students to sabotage a strike. There is also a Catholic University of Washington dedicated to training diplomats for the State Department. Forty percent of the State Department's new officials come from this school.

　　America's lack of democracy can also be seen in the issue of ethnic minorities. The Native Americans who first lived in the Americas have long been wiped out by the Americans using the annihilation method. Now only a small number of Native Americans are designated to live in demarcated areas.

　　In the United States, Mexicans are also a pitiful minority. They do all the hard and rough work. Americans transport them back and forth like cattle and horses. When they are needed, they are recruited, and when they are not needed, they are deported. In American movies, the good guys are all golden-haired and white-skinned, and the bad guys are always non-Anglo-Saxons.

　　The ethnic minority with the largest population is the Black people. They number between twelve and fifteen million. The American definition of black people is the same as Hitler's definition of Jews. No matter how many generations there have been, as long as there is one black person in your ancestry, you become a black person. Once, a black university president and two local senators went to Washington to meet the president about school matters. This black man had blonde hair, white skin, blue eyes, and his last name was White. After the president asked them to sit down, he said to the black-haired senator sitting on the left: "You know how I have always treated you black people!" The senator stood up and said: "I'm sorry, I am of Anglo descent!" The president felt presumptuous and immediately said to the friend on the right whose skin color was not quite right: "It turns out that what I just said was addressed to you!" That gentleman also jumped up and said: "I am of pure European descent!" The president was surprised and said: "Mr. White, you certainly can't be black either!"

　　Discrimination against black people is most prevalent in the South. There, buses are segregated, and white hotels, restaurants, hospitals, etc., are not allowed to admit black people. We can often see a black person run over by a car and lying dead on the street because white hospitals refuse to admit him, and black hospitals are pitifully few. During World War II, even the toilets in the American army were divided into black and white.

　　In Washington, black people cannot enter noble restaurants or hotels. Once, the president wanted to host the King of Abyssinia in "Daughters of the American Revolution Hall", but a white lady insisted on driving out the black people, so the black king had to retreat. Another time, the president introduced the President of Haiti to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. The hotel owner could not refuse, so he emptied half of the hotel and specially prepared an elevator for the President of Haiti to use alone. These examples are simply endless. Let me give another typical example of lynching. According to American law, buses traveling between states cannot discriminate against black people. But a black soldier who had retired from the war took such a bus back to his hometown in Virginia. When the driver reached the state line, he suddenly asked the black man to get off the bus. The black man refused to get off the bus, relying on the law. The driver asked the local police officer to drag the black man off the bus, and also gouged out both of his eyes. Later, the black man sued the court, and the result of the verdict was: the black man disobeyed the police officer and was sentenced to one year in prison.

　　American opposition to Jews is no less than Hitler's. American universities secretly limit the number of Jewish students. As for American discrimination against Asians, that goes without saying.

　　The United States has always been very proud of its economy. But even according to the journalist Gunther, who is very sympathetic to capitalism, half of Americans have a monthly income of less than $122. This money is only enough to rent a decent place to live. According to official American statistics, there are five million unemployed people in the United States. If those who are semi-employed are included, there are eighteen million people. However, President Truman is still proudly saying: As long as the number of unemployed does not exceed six million, this kind of unemployment is very normal.

　　An so-called "economist" named Johnson complacently said: "Every American has a share of capital in American capitalism." It is true that there are quite a few Americans who hold one or two shares of stock. On the surface, this seems to be economic democratization. But the fact is completely the opposite. In the past, if you wanted to control a business, you had to have 51 percent of the stock. But now you only need to have 15 to 20 percent of the stock to control the whole thing, because those scattered small shareholders simply don't care and can't care.

　　Americans have now invented light bulbs that can be used for ten years, but capitalists are unwilling to manufacture such light bulbs because these light bulbs will cause the light bulb business to plummet. The United States has only recently begun to use television more widely. In fact, this thing was invented more than ten years ago, because wireless businessmen did not want it to be born early, so it was shelved for ten years before it was taken out.

　　Money has become a fetish in American society. This can be seen from the following small matter: In France, the shape of tie clips is a heart; in Germany, the form of the clip is a sword; in the United States, it becomes a money shape. Suppose there is a black person who has served in the White House for 40 years and retires. What reward will he get? He will definitely get a one-dollar bill with the president's autograph on it. In other countries, people often put photos of their loved ones in the frame on the table, but in the United States, what is placed here is the first bill he earned. There is an old saying: Time is money. So Americans are in a hurry all day long, for fear of losing time, and thus losing money. A New York tavern hung a good advertisement saying: "Please drink two pounds of whiskey, get drunk in one go, so you can save time."

　　In ordinary countries, in order to prevent forest fires, signs are hung in the forest saying "Be careful of fire, please do not violate the law." But in the United States, the sign says, "If there is a fire, you won't be able to afford it." In ordinary countries, when we ask about someone's status, the other party's answer must be what he does, but in the United States, their answer will be: "His salary is 10,000 yuan!" Furthermore, when we have some new ideas, we propose them to people. But Americans don't like to use the word "propose." They like to say: "I sold my ideas to so-and-so." That's right, the "Voice of America" of the US State Department is an organization that specializes in selling the so-called "American way of life."

　　The culture produced in this kind of society is of course childishly ridiculous. You can often see some dignified gentlemen on American streetcars reading the newspaper with relish. What are they reading? Not news, but children's comic strips. Everyone knows that the best-selling cereal in the United States is Kellogg's cereal, because this company is good at advertising, saying that a person who eats this cereal can be strong and vigorous, and even that eating it will give them the strength to lift a thousand pounds and run on walls. This absurd thing can only be popular in the United States.

　　American movies are either Westerns or crime movies. There are also some nonsensical films about beautiful women and wealthy people, describing how a poor girl marries a millionaire. In American newsstands, you can often find one or twenty kinds of superstitious fortune-telling books. It is said that Hollywood has recently invented a new type of Buddhism. An American invented an artificial rain machine, but when people asked him how he invented it, he replied: "This is because God gave me this idea, this is the merit of Catholicism." As Steinbeck said, the status of American artists is only between clowns and donkeys. We all know how valuable the title of university professor is. But in the United States, when people look down on someone, they will disdainfully scold: "Humph, this university professor!"

　　This degenerate culture also reflects the reactionary policies of the American government. As is well known, there is a most famous character in American comic strips called Superman, who is said to be immune to bullets, fly, box, and specialize in rescuing beautiful women in distress. Truman's foreign policy is also this kind of American-style Superman diplomacy. He believes that the United States can overwhelm China with a mouthful of saliva, and pacify the world with the movement of a finger.

　　In addition to degeneration, American culture also has a commercial characteristic, which is mass production. But Americans don't have time to watch, so the form of mass production has become excerpts. It shortens novels, scripts, or any other books into very short things, specially for those who have no time to use their brains to read. American public opinion can also be produced in large quantities and ordered in large quantities. Even the same writer can simultaneously write two articles with absolutely opposite views and publish them in newspapers in various places belonging to the two news trusts, and not be ashamed.

　　Americans scold Marxism every day, so they probably understand something about Marxism! In fact, this is not the case. People in the American government are proud of saying, "I have never read a sentence of Marx's works." News reporters talk about anti-communism all the time. When asked, "What is the meaning of the communism you are talking about?" They said: "Communism is the most common term, does it still need to be explained!" But none of the twenty people could say what communism is.

　　American science and schools cannot but be commercialized. The vice presidents of American universities are mostly responsible for raising money. When Eisenhower took office as the president of Columbia University, he boasted that he would raise 100 million US dollars for the school. People who donate money are not willing to donate money for nothing. They have conditions. They do not allow the school to cultivate students who oppose capitalists. The president of New Jersey University said: "I want to truly cultivate some just union leaders, but I cannot donate a penny to the industrial leaders because of this."

　　As everyone knows, the US Department of the Army has a large research fund. In order to strive for a small share of this fund, American universities have to cater to the Army's wishes and open some militaristic courses.

　　Now, the United States has become a base for harboring communist traitors. These traitors can make a lot of money by writing articles attacking or slandering the Soviet Union. When the United States was founded, the people looked down on traitors the most, but unexpectedly, their descendants became people who specialize in supporting traitors.

　　If Washington were alive now, still leading an independence movement in a certain colony, and accidentally came to the United States, then Truman would definitely lock him up, because Washington dared to advocate revolution!

### “美国生活方式”究竟是什么样？

　　“美国生活方式”究竟是什么样？
    梅豪士
    美帝国主义的喉舌，天天在叫卖着“美国生活方式”。“美国生活方式”究竟是什么样子呢？这篇文字是根据一位在美国住了多年的作家关于他在美国见闻的谈话写成的，可以帮助答复这个问题。         
    美国人一向以民主自夸。但说来也许令人不信，它在法律上却并不是一个民主国。美国的宪法上只规定美国是一个共和国而没有规定它是一个民主国。最近美国南方的一些民主党人就在国会大叫：“美国是共和国，不是民主国。”
    美国南部几州的人口有二百万，但参加参议员选举的人不足一万名。很多地区的黑人和没有钱的白人都因纳不起人头税而被剥夺去了选举权。阿尔巴马州有一条法律规定选举委员会可有权要求投票人解释宪法，不能解释宪法就没有选举权。这些委员老爷当然不会叫白色选民来解释的，他们只要求黑人解释。有一次，选举委员要一位黑人选民解释宪法上的一个问题，这位黑人不能回答，当然也就被剥夺选举权利。后来他们把这个问题交给了州立大学法学院长去研究，这位法学博士研究了三天才作出了一个答案，这个答案说：“这个问题是无法解答的。”
    有些人说美国是一个新教国家，但这几年来，天主教已蒸蒸日上而具有压倒之势了。如所周知，教堂是美国人生活中不可少的一部分，尤以在小镇与乡村中为然。在这些小镇与乡村中，美国人所可解闷者就是无线电、电影、酒巴与教堂。教堂里有时装表现、有跳舞会、有演讲，也有一种叫Ｂingo的赌博。赢钱的人要拿出百分之十五给上帝作头钱。对教堂来说，这是一笔不小的收入。所以有一次纽约州通过了一个禁止Ｂingo的法案时，各派牧师都起来反对，结果这个法案是被废除了。
    美国宗教中最反动的就是天主教。梵蒂冈在美国的头子名叫斯比尔曼，他有一次曾发动天主教学生去破坏罢工。还有一个天主教华盛顿大学专门在那儿替国务院训练外交人员，百分之四十的国务院新官员就是从这个学校里出来的。
    美国的无民主又可在少数民族问题上看出来。最先生长在美洲的印第安人早已被美国人用清剿法把他们消灭殆尽了，现在只剩下很少数的印第安人被指定居住在圈定的区域内。
    在美国，墨西哥人也是一个可怜的少数民族，他们做的都是苦工和粗工。美国人把他们当牛马一般装运来往。需要时把他们招来，不要了又把他们驱逐出境。美国电影中的好人都是黄金发的白皮肤人，坏蛋总是非盎克鲁撒克逊人。
    少数民族人数最多的是黑人。他们有一千二百万至一千五百万。美国对黑人的定义是与希特勒对犹太人的定义一样的。不管有几代，只要你的祖先系统中有一个黑人，你就成了黑人。有一次，一位黑人的大学校长和当地的两位参议员为了学校事到华盛顿谒见总统。这位黑人长的是黄头发、白皮肤、碧眼睛、而且又姓白（Ｗhi—Ｔe）。总统待他们坐下后就对坐在左边的黑头发的参议员说：“你知道我对你们黑人态度一向是如何的吧！”那位参议员站起来说：“对不起，我是盎格鲁种呵！”总统自感冒失，马上向右边那位肤色不大对的朋友说：“我刚才的话原来是对你讲的呀！”那位先生也跳了起来说：“我是纯粹欧洲种呵！”总统吃了一惊说：“白先生，你一定也不会是黑人呀！”
    歧视黑人的现象最盛行于南方。在那儿，坐公共汽车是黑白分开的，白人的旅馆、饭馆、医院等是不准黑人进去的。我们常可看到一个被汽车辗伤的黑人暴尸在街上，因为白人医院不肯收他，而黑人医院又少得可怜。第二次大战中，甚至连美国军队的厕所也分了黑白两种。
    在华盛顿，黑人不能进高贵的饭馆或旅馆。有一次，总统要在“革命儿女大厅”招待阿比西尼亚王，但有一位白色女士非要赶走黑人不可，所以这位黑国王只好退回去。还有一次，总统介绍海地总统往纽约华尔道夫大旅馆，旅馆老板不好拒绝，就把旅馆的一半都空了出来，特准备了一个升降机，供这位海地总统一人使用。这些例子简直举不胜举。不妨再说一个典型的私刑例。照美国的法律，来往于两州间的公共汽车是不能有歧视黑人之举的。但有一位从大战中退伍的黑人士兵乘了这种公共汽车回老家佛吉尼亚州，司机在开到州界时忽然要请这位黑人下车，黑人就以法律为凭不肯下车，司机就请当地的警官来把黑人拖下车，而且还挖去了他的两只眼睛。后来黑人向法院起诉，判决的结果是：黑人违抗警官，处徒刑一年。
    美国反对犹太人也不稍逊于希特勒，美国大学都秘密地限制犹太学生人数。至于美国歧视亚洲人，那也是不必提了的。
    美国对自己的经济一向很自傲的。但即使照很同情资本主义的记者根室说，美国人有二分之一其每月收入不足一百二十二元。这些钱只够租一间像样的住所而已。据美国官方统计，美国的失业人数有五百万，若把半失业的算入，则有一千八百万人。不过杜鲁门总统还在那儿很骄傲地说：只要失业人数不超过六百万，这种失业是很正常的。
    有一位叫约翰生的所谓“经济学家”沾沾自喜的说：“每一个美国人在美国的资本主义中有其一份资本。”不错，持有一二张股票的美国人的确不少。这表面上看来似乎是经济民主化。但事实却完全相反。在从前，你若要控制一个企业就须有百分之五十一的股票。但现在你只要有百分之十五至二十的股票就可控制全体了，因为那些零星散户根本就不管事，也管不了事。
    美国现在已有人发明了可用十年的灯泡，但资本家不愿制这种灯泡，因为这种灯泡将使灯泡商的生意一落千丈。美国最近才较普遍地使用电视了，其实这东西在十多年前早已发明，因为无线电商不愿它早出世，所以就搁了十年才拿出来。
    金钱已成了美国社会的拜物教。从下面一件小事中就可看出来：在法国，领带别针的形状是鸡心；在德国，别针的形式是剑；在美国，它就成了金钱形。假设现在有一个黑人在白宫服务了四十年而告老退休了，那他将得到什么报酬呢？他一定将得到一张一元钞票，上加总统的亲笔签名。在别的国家内，人们常在桌上的镜框内放上自己爱人的照片，但在美国，这里头放的却是他第一次赚到的一张钞票。有一句老话说：时间是金钱。所以美国人一天到晚在匆忙中，惟恐失去时间，也就少了金钱。有一家纽约酒馆中就挂了一个很好的广告说：“请喝两磅装威士忌，一喝就醉，好节省时间。”
    在普通的国家内，为防止森林失火计，会在森林中挂“小心火烛，请勿违法”的牌子。但在美国的牌子上写的却是“若一失火，你就赔不起呵。”在普通国家内，我们问及某人地位如何时，对方的回答一定是说他做的什么事，但在美国，他们的回答将是：“他的薪水一万元！”再说，当我们有什么新的意见时，我们是向人提出意见。但美国人不爱用“提出”两字，他们喜欢说：“我向某某人卖出了我的意见。”不错，美国国务院的“美国之声”就是专门出卖所谓“美国生活方式”的机关。
    这种社会中所产生的文化当然也就幼稚得可笑。你常常可以在美国电车中，看到一些道貌岸然的绅士在津津有味的阅报，他读的是什么呢？不是新闻，而原来是小孩儿看的连环图画。大家都知道，美国的麦片中最畅销的是克洛革牌麦片，因为这个公司善于做广告，说一个人吃了这种麦片可身强力壮，甚至说吃了它会力举千钧、飞檐走壁。这种荒谬的事也只有在美国吃得开。
    美国的电影不是西部片就是犯罪片。还有一些胡说八道的佳人财主片，描述一个穷女孩如何嫁给了一个百万大富翁。在美国书报摊上，你经常可以找到一、二十种迷信算命书籍，听说好莱坞最近又发明了一种新佛教。有一位美国人发明了一种人造雨机器，但当人家问他怎样发明的时候，他回答说：“这是因为上帝赐给我这种思想，这是天主教的功德呵。”正如史坦倍克所说，美国艺术家的地位仅在小丑与驴子之间。我们都知道大学教授是一个多么可贵的头衔。但在美国，当人家看不起一个人时，就会不屑的骂道：“哼，这个大学教授！”
    这种堕落的文化也反应了美国政府的反动政策。如所周知，美国连环画中有一个最著名的就叫做超人大力士，据说他会枪弹不入，飞行拳击，而且专门挽救受难的漂亮女人。杜鲁门的外交政策也就是这种美国式的超人外交，他认为美国只要吐一口痰就可把中国压倒，只要动一个手指就可把世界镇平。
    除了堕落以外，美国的文化还有一个商业特点，这就是大量生产。但美国人没有时间看，所以大量生产的形式就成了摘录。它把小说、剧本、或其他任何书籍缩成很短的东西，专供那批没有时间用脑筋的人阅读。美国的舆论也是可以大批制造的，大批定货的。甚至同一个作家，可以同时写出两种主张绝对相反的论文，登在两个新闻托拉斯所属的各地报纸上，而恬不为耻。
    美国人天天在骂马克思主义，那他们大概多少会懂得一些马克思主义吧！事实上却并不如此。美国政府中的人竟以“我从来没有念过一句马克思作品”为自荣。新闻记者口口声声反共，问他们“你们所说的共产主义是什么意义呀？”他们说：“共产主义是一个最普遍的名词，这难道还要解释吗！”但他们二十人中竟没有一个人能说出什么是共产主义。
    美国的科学与学校当然也不能不商业化。美国大学的副校长就大多是专门负责弄钱的。艾森豪威尔在就任哥伦比亚大学校长时就夸口说他要为学校弄一万万美金。捐钱的人可不肯白捐钱的，他们是有条件的，他们不许学校培养反对资本家的学生。有一位纽杰西大学的校长说：“我想真正培养一些正义的工会领袖，但我竟因此而不能向工业界领袖捐到一分钱。”
    大家知道，美国陆军部有一大笔研究费，美国各大学为了想争取这笔款子中的一小份，就不得不迎合陆军之意，开了一些军国主义的课程。
    现在，美国已成了收容共产主义叛徒的大本营，这些叛徒们只要写一些攻击或污蔑苏联的文章就可大发其财。美国在开国时，人民是最看不起叛徒的，不料他们的子孙却成了专门捧叛徒的人了。
    如果华盛顿现在活着，仍然在某一个殖民地领导独立运动，并且因为不小心而来到美国，那杜鲁门一定会把他关起来的，因为华盛顿竟敢倡导革命啊！
