　　Adapting to the Actual Needs of Rural Elementary Schools
    Chicheng Unifies the Supply of Teaching Materials
    Improving the Efficiency of Elementary School Office Expenses and Saving Expenditures
    [Our Newspaper] Chicheng County, Chahar Province, has been piloting the unified supply of teaching materials to rural elementary schools since April of last year, which has improved the efficiency of elementary school office expenses. This method is now being promoted in seven counties of Southern Chahar. Due to inconvenient transportation in the counties of Southern Chahar, there is a significant price difference between urban and rural areas. Elementary schools in Chicheng County purchase stationery, lamp oil, and other supplies for teaching and office use, with prices in rural areas being about twice as high as in the county seat. For example, sesame oil in the county seat costs the equivalent of six catties of millet per catty, while in rural areas it costs twelve catties. Rural elementary schools only have twenty-five catties of millet per month for office expenses, which can only buy one catty of lamp oil, one box of chalk, and one ink stick, making it impossible to purchase other supplies. Only seventeen elementary schools in the entire county are able to subscribe to newspapers, and there is no discussion of teachers' learning materials. Last spring, the county held an education work conference, where this situation was discussed, and it was decided to stop issuing office expenses to each school and instead provide supplies in kind. A cadre with experience in business management was selected to be responsible for organizing a cultural supply cooperative to uniformly purchase the office and teaching supplies needed by each elementary school and distribute them to each school according to the prescribed standards. Since the implementation of this method, the supply of lamp oil, stationery, and other teaching and office supplies to rural elementary schools has been guaranteed, and each school has been subscribed to one copy of the newspaper and one copy of "Chahar Education" as materials for teachers' professional development. At the same time, from April of last year to March of this year, under the item of office expense savings, each rural elementary school added a kang mat, and also saved two thousand five hundred catties of millet. The county plans to use this, together with this year's savings, to gradually purchase harmoniums for each complete elementary school; and to purchase some popular reading materials to lay the foundation for the establishment of cultural and educational centers. Now, seven counties in Southern Chahar are also promoting the methods piloted in Chicheng County to solve the difficulties of shortage of elementary school office expenses.

　　适应农村小学实际需要
    赤城统一供应教学用品
    提高小学办公费效用节省开支
    【本报讯】察哈尔省赤城县自去年四月起试行统一供应各农村小学的教学用品，提高了小学办公费的效用。此项办法现已在察南七个县推行。察南各县因交通不便，城乡物价相差颇大。赤城县各小学购买教学办公用的文具、灯油等，乡村间的价格高于县城一倍左右。如麻油在县城每斤合小米六斤，而在农村则需十二斤。农村小学每月仅有办公费小米二十五斤，只能买到灯油一斤、粉笔一盒、墨一锭，其他用品均无法购置。全县仅有十七处小学能订阅报纸，教员学习材料更谈不到。去年春该县召开教育工作会议时，讨论了此一情况，确定停发各校办公费，改成实物供给。并抽调一名富有经营商业经验的干部，负责组织文化供应社，统一购置各小学所需的办公教学用品，按规定的标准发给各校。自实行此办法后，各农村小学教学办公用的灯油、文具等的供应均获得保证，并为每校订阅了一份报纸和一份《察哈尔教育》，以作教师业务学习的材料。同时，自去年四月到今年三月，在办公费节余项下，每个乡村小学添置了一条炕席，另外还节余了小米二千五百斤。该县计划以此再加上今年的节余，逐渐为各完全小学添购风琴；并购买一些办众读物，打下成立文教馆的基础。现在，察南七个县亦正推行赤城县所试行的办法，以解决小学办公费短少的困难。
