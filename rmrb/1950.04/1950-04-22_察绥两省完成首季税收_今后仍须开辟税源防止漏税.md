　　Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces Complete First Quarter Tax Revenue
    Continued Efforts Needed to Develop Tax Sources and Prevent Tax Evasion
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Chahar Daily News of April 15th, Chahar Province's tax revenue for the first quarter of 1950 (January to March) has exceeded the central government's assigned task by 3.2 percent, completing 89.79 percent of the task self-assigned to the central government. Among them, the Yanbei Special Bureau completed 74.16 percent of the task assigned by the provincial bureau, Chanan completed 68.94 percent, and Chabei completed 83.07 percent. Zhangjiakou City Bureau exceeded the provincial bureau's assigned figure by 6 percent, and Datong City Bureau exceeded it by 8.89 percent. Xuanhua City Bureau only completed 76.54 percent of the task assigned by the provincial bureau. The first quarter's tax revenue task has been overfulfilled according to the central government's assigned figures; however, the task self-assigned to the central government by the provincial bureau, based on the province's specific conditions, has not been completed. Apart from the fact that the industrial and commercial tax for March was levied in April according to instructions from higher authorities, and a portion of the tax revenue was not yet deposited, other taxes such as stamp, transaction, and itinerant merchant taxes were indeed poorly completed in some areas. In addition to objective reasons such as unfamiliarity with the business and poor control of tax sources in individual regions, the main reason lies in the fact that some tax cadres still harbor the idea of downplaying tax revenue, and the phenomenon of tax evasion remains serious. Chabei is sparsely populated with a relatively small industrial and commercial tax base, but a relatively large number of itinerant merchants and transaction taxes. However, itinerant merchants conduct transactions in remote rural areas, and due to the unsound tax institutions, there are large loopholes. Other places such as Yanbei and Xuanhua also have tax evasion. Continued attention must be paid to developing tax sources and preventing tax evasion in the future.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Suiyuan Daily News of April 15th, the Suiyuan Provincial Tax Bureau has conducted a preliminary inspection of the first quarter's tax revenue work. According to incomplete statistics, it has overfulfilled the task according to the central government's regulations. According to the province's Second Tax Conference, the self-assigned first quarter task was exceeded by 13 percent in Shanba City, Baotou City completed 100 percent of the task, Guisui City completed 80 percent, Suidong completed 54 percent, and Suinan completed 35 percent. According to preliminary understanding, serious instances of tax evasion exist in all regions, regardless of whether they exceeded the task or failed to complete it. In Suidong, stamp tax evasion in Jining alone is 50 percent, and transaction tax evasion is about 30 percent. Therefore, in-depth leadership inspection and management of tax revenue is the direction of effort to implement policies and complete tasks in the future.
    The main reasons for achieving these results are: (1) Correctly implementing the tax revenue work policy for the new district, that is, temporarily using the old tax system uniformly after entering the Sui West New District, and carrying out steady reforms in a planned manner during the process of using it. Therefore, the tax revenue work was not affected in any way at the time of provincial political unification and thereafter. (2) Grasping the two tax revenue focuses of the province – Baotou City and Guisui City, and striving to unify the tax institutions of these two cities as soon as possible at the beginning of provincial political unification. The total amount completed by the two cities in the first quarter reached 82 percent of the total amount completed by the province, and the annual budget of the two cities accounts for almost two-thirds of the province. The work focuses on grasping several central tasks, such as levying transaction taxes in the new district, clearing old inventory in the market, and clearing old taxes. Among the clearing of old taxes, the focus was on clearing last year's income tax and business tax. For example, the newly opened transaction tax in Guisui City ranked third in the city's tax revenue, accounting for 17 percent of the city's total completion. (3) Replacing the old regime's practice of contracted tax payment with practical and serious collection methods. For example, the stamp tax in Guisui City in the past was paid at one-tenth of the business tax. Taking the stamp tax obtained in November as an index, in January of this year, it was only 1.57 times that of November due to lack of consideration for rectification. After the rectification in February, it suddenly increased to 7 times that of November. (4) Paying attention to investigation, research, and control of tax sources. For example, in clearing the income tax for the second half of last year in Guisui City, a relatively in-depth representative household survey was conducted, and a preliminary understanding of the industrial and commercial situation was obtained. Various methods were used to break through the false accounts of commercial firms and master the true materials, so that the work of clearing old taxes in the two cities could be completed smoothly. Furthermore, various localities generally paid attention to controlling tax source issues. Every time they arrived in a place, they first controlled the main concentration areas of goods, such as stations, post offices, and passenger and freight yards, as well as traffic arteries. Goods arriving must be registered and guaranteed, and orders must be inspected, so that tax revenue loopholes were reduced. In addition, the hard work of all comrades in the tax bureau was also one of the reasons.
    The main shortcomings in the work are the existence of isolated practices, the inability to carry out general work around the center, and taking care of the center but not other things. There is also the small-scale handicraft industry method of the rural era, and unfamiliarity with the work methods of urban tax revenue work. The central work in the future is to strengthen tax institutions, improve the quality of existing cadres, and strengthen inspection and supervision work to ensure that all regions can complete the scheduled tasks. Furthermore, we will rectify tax revenue, develop tax sources, strengthen propaganda work and tax management work, and block tax evasion so that all taxes that should be collected can be collected in full.

### 察绥两省完成首季税收  今后仍须开辟税源防止漏税

　　察绥两省完成首季税收
    今后仍须开辟税源防止漏税
    【本报讯】据四月十五日察哈尔日报消息：察省一九五零年第一季度（一至三月份）税收已超过中央分配任务的百分之三点二。完成向中央自认任务的百分之八十九点七九。其中雁北专局完成省局分配任务的百分之七十四点一六，察南完成百分之六十八点九四，察北完成百分之八十三点零七；张家口市局超过省局分配数字百分之六，大同市局超过百分之八点八九。宣化市局仅完成省局分配任务的百分之七十六点五四。第一季税收任务根据中央分配数字已超额完成；但省局根据该省具体情况，向中央自认任务则未完成。除了三月份工商业税根据上级指示在四月份开征，一部税款没有入库外，其他如印花、交易、行商等税，有些地方确是完成的很差。除了个别地区因业务不熟悉，对税源控制较差等客观原因外，主要原因，还在于某些税务干部，轻视税收思想和漏税现象依然严重存在。察北地广人稀，工商业税源较少，行商、交易税源较多，可是行商都在偏僻的乡村交易，因税务机构不健全，漏洞很大。其他如雁北、宣化等地均有漏税现象。今后仍须注意开辟税源，防止漏税。
    【本报讯】据四月十五日绥远日报消息：绥远省税务局初步检查了第一季税收工作，据不完全统计，按中央规定已超额完成。按该省二届税务会议自拟的第一季任务则陕坝市超过任务百分之十三，包头市百分之百的完成了任务归绥市完成百分之八十，绥东完成百分之五十四，绥南完成百分之三十五。据初步了解，各区不论超过任务或未完成任务，都还存在着严重的偷漏现象。绥东方面，在集宁仅印花税偷漏百分之五十，交易税偷漏百分之三十左右，因此今后深入领导检查与管理税收是贯彻政策完成任务的努力方向。
    能获致这些成绩，其主要原因是：（一）正确的执行了新区税收工作方针，即在进入绥西新区后暂时一律沿用旧的税制，在沿用过程中，有计划的进行稳步改革，因此在省政统一时及以后税收工作上并没有受到什么影响。（二）抓住全省的两个税收重点——包头市与归绥市，省政统一之初尽先争取该两市税务机构的统一。第一季两市完成总额即达到全省完成数的百分之八十二，按两市全年预算几占全省的三分之二。工作上是抓住几件中心工作，如开征新区交易税，清理市场旧存货物和清理旧税。清理旧税中，又确定了主要清理去年的所得税与营业税。如归绥市新辟交易税，为该市税收的第三位，占全市完成总额的百分之一七。（三）以切实认真的稽征方法代替了旧政权时代的包税认缴的作法，如归绥市过去印花税是按营业税的十分之一认缴。以十一月份所得印花税作为指数，今年一月份因未顾及整顿仅为十一月的一·五七倍，二月份整顿后突然增至十一月的七倍。（四）注意了调查研究和控制税源，如归绥市在清理去年下半年所得税，比较深入的进行了代表户调查，初步了解了工商情况，运用各种方式突破商号的假账，掌握了真实材料，使两市清理旧税工作得以顺利完成。再就是各地一般均注意控制税源问题，每到一地首先把车站、邮局、客货栈等货物的主要集中地以及交通要道控制起来，来货必须登记找保，定货须经查验，使税收漏洞减少，此外税局全体同志的艰苦工作也是其中的原因之一。
    在工作中的主要缺点是存在着单打一的作法，不善于把一般工作围绕着中心去进行，顾了中心顾不了其它。还有农村时代小手小脚的手工业方式，不熟习城市税收工作的工作方式。今后中心工作是加强税务机构，提高现有干部质量和加强检查督促工作，保证各地都能完成预定任务，再进一步整顿税收，开辟税源，加强宣传工作和课税管理工作，堵塞漏税，使应收的税都能收齐。
