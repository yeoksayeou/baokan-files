　　The Northeast Innovation Record Movement is Also Feasible in Guannei

To the Editors:

    The People's Daily published on December 22nd last year on page three a short commentary entitled "Beware of Mechanical Copying", which explained the conditions for launching the innovation record movement in the Northeast and opposed the launch of the innovation record movement in some newly liberated cities, resulting in a tendency towards physical fatigue. But what attitude should we take towards this movement, which is already being widely launched in the Northeast? What experience should we draw from this movement to apply to our own work? These questions were not clearly explained. Therefore, we doubt: is the Northeast's innovation record movement equally feasible in Guannei?

Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League:

    The innovation record movement promoted by various factories, mines and economic construction departments in the Northeast Liberated Area is also feasible in Guannei. Many factories and mines across the country are accepting the advanced experience of the Northeast to launch a new record movement, and the facts have already proven that it is successful.

    Why can the innovation record movement be promoted in Guannei?

    This is because (1) the working class has been liberated and become the leading class of the country. They manage their own factories and mines as masters, and give full play to their creativity to build the country. This political condition is a prerequisite for creating a new record movement. This condition is available in all factories and mines across the country. (2) The content of the innovation record movement is multifaceted. The new record movement is a multifaceted movement. There are new records for shortening working hours; new records for increasing production and quality; new records for reducing costs; new records for saving water and electricity; new records for reducing raw material consumption and reducing the number of defective products; new records for eliminating accidents; new records for increasing recovery rates; new records for improving the safe operation rate of machinery and equipment; new records for improving management systems and management methods, etc. Therefore, the innovation record movement can adapt to different environments and conditions and have different content. (3) The new record movement is a mass movement. New records can be individual or collective, workers or cadres. It often starts from individual, piecemeal, and spontaneous new records, and gradually develops in a wider mass direction with the help of leadership, to achieve the goal of completing and exceeding the overall production tasks. Therefore, the innovation record movement is the result of the combination of leadership and the masses, rather than a product of the special circumstances of the Northeast.

    Guannei is fully qualified to carry out the new record movement, this is certain.

    Some people believe that: "Only after the organization is sound and everyone assumes responsibility can we engage in the creation of a new record movement"; "We must first establish a system, and only after sufficient preparation can we engage in the new record movement"; "The ideological awareness of workers is not enough, we must run training classes before engaging in the new record movement"; "We must first promote democracy and rectify the cadres before engaging in the new record movement." These views are setting this widespread mass innovation record movement against "reorganization," "establishing systems," "democracy," and "improving the political and ideological level of employees," which is wrong. These tasks can be solved completely in the innovation record movement, otherwise these tasks will fall through.

    This newspaper published an article entitled "Beware of Mechanical Copying" on page three on December 22nd last year, criticizing some local factories and mines for ignoring specific circumstances and mechanically copying the experience of the Northeast, resulting in certain phenomena that could affect production, harm workers' health, and waste tools and raw materials. It is right to criticize this phenomenon. However, the article did not explain that the innovation record movement is a successful experience, and all parts of the country can learn from this experience to improve enterprise management based on actual conditions, which is a major shortcoming.

### 东北创新纪录运动在关内同样是可行的

　　东北创新纪录运动在关内同样是可行的编辑同志：
    去年十二月二十二日人民日报三版载有一则题目为“警惕机械搬运”的短评，解释了创新纪录运动在东北展开的条件，反对某些新解放城市也搞创新纪录运动。并发生了肉体疲劳的偏向；但对东北已在广泛展开的这一运动应对它采取什么态度？我们应从这一运动中吸取什么经验以应用于自己的工作中？这些问题解释的还不够明确。因此我们怀疑：东北的创新纪录运动在关内是否也同样可行呢？
        北京市青年团工委会北京市青年团工委会：
    东北解放区各厂矿及经济建设部门所推行的创新纪录运动，在关内同样是可行的。全国很多厂矿正接受东北的先进经验开展新纪录运动，而且事实已经证明它是成功的。
    为什么创新纪录运动在关内可以推行呢？
    这是因为（一）工人阶级得到了解放，成为国家的领导阶级，他们是以主人翁姿态来管理自己的厂矿，发扬自己最大的创造性，建设国家。这种政治条件是创造新纪录运动的先决条件。这个条件，在全国一切厂矿中都是具备的。（二）创新纪录运动的内容是多方面的，新纪录运动是一个多方面的运动。有缩短工作时间的新纪录；有提高产量、质量的新纪录；有减低成本的新纪录；有节省水电的新纪录；有降低原材料消耗，减少废品数量的新纪录；有消灭事故的新纪录；有提高回收率的新纪录；有提高机器设备安全转率的新纪录；有改善管理制度和管理方法的新纪录等，因此，创新纪录运动可以适应不同的环境及条件而有其不同的内容。（三）新纪录运动是一个群众性运动，新纪录可以是个人的，也可以是集体的，可以是工人的，也可以是干部的。它往往是从个别的零碎的自发的新纪录，经过领导上的帮助，逐渐向更广泛的群众性的方向发展，达到完成与超过总的生产任务的目的。因此，创新纪录运动是领导与群众结合的结果，而不是东北特殊情况的产物。
    关内完全有条件开展新纪录运动，这是可以肯定的。
    有人认为：“机构健全后，大家都负起责任来，才能搞创造新纪录运动”；“先建立制度，有了充分的准备后才能搞新纪录运动”；“工人思想觉悟还不够，要办过训练班后再搞新纪录运动”；“先发扬民主，整一整干部再搞新纪录运动。”这些看法，是把这个广泛的群众性的创新纪录运动和“整编”、“建立制度”、“民主”、“提高职工政治思想水平”对立起来，这是不对的。这些工作完全可以在创新纪录运动中去解决，否则就会使这些工作落空。
    本报三版去年十二月二十二日发表一篇题名为“警惕机械搬运”的短文。批评某些地方厂矿不顾具体情况，机械搬运东北经验，以致发生某些足以影响生产、妨害工人健康、浪费工具原料的现象。批评这一现象是对的。但该文对于创新纪录运动是一个成功的经验，全国各地均可从实际出发吸取这一经验来改进企业的管理这一基本的一面，并未加以说明，则是一个很大的缺陷。
