The women of the Hufangqiao Adult Night School in the ninth district outside of Hepingmen in the capital were deeply moved after hearing the teacher tell the story of Zhao Guilan, and wrote letters of sympathy. In addition to sending the original eleven letters directly to Comrade Zhao Guilan, we have selected the following three to publish. Among them, Han Yushi is a 49-year-old housewife. - Editor

Dear Revolutionary Pioneer Comrade Zhao Guilan:

I am a student at the Hufangqiao Adult Night School in Beijing. On March 30th, when Teacher Liu was giving us a Chinese class, he said: Today I will tell you the story of a female Communist Party member, Comrade Zhao Guilan. Teacher Liu told Comrade's story completely from beginning to end. After listening, I felt very sad, and I also thought that your courage is really great. In order to protect our people's factories and the lives of everyone, you sacrificed your own life to protect our construction and the lives and property of our people. This is truly a great and glorious thing, and you have truly created a glorious deed for the working people of our motherland. Our people all know your sincerity and your courage. We don't know how to thank you enough. You are truly a model for our working people.

Please don't worry about your low level of education. After you recover from your illness and are discharged from the hospital, we will sincerely help you study. Not much more to say. I wish you a speedy recovery!

                                                Wang Baochun

Comrade Zhao Guilan:

Since I saw the article in the March 13th People's Daily: "Regarding Whether Zhao Guilan Should Throw Away the 'Fulminate of Mercury'", in my opinion, it was right for you not to throw away the "Fulminate of Mercury." Because Comrade Liu Shaoqi clearly stated that for the sake of the interests of the entire Party, in serious situations, it is necessary to sacrifice oneself to take care of the property and interests of the country. You resolutely implemented the Bolshevik principles. Under the education of the Party, you represented the working women of China in doing a sensational thing. This is worthy of our learning from you. Finally, I wish you a speedy recovery. And regards!

                                            Your comrade Wang Xiuzhen

Comrade Guilan:

Recently, I heard Mr. Liu from our night school say that you were seriously injured in the factory. The doctor in the hospital performed surgery to remove one arm and one hand. When I heard this news, I was so scared that I broke out in a cold sweat and felt very sad. I hope you take good care of your body in the hospital, and after you recover, with your keen mind and active work spirit, you can also serve the people in the new society. You are a good and famous hero of the country. Not much to write, we'll talk next time. I wish you a speedy recovery and discharge from the hospital!

                                          Your comrade Han Yushi

　　首都虎坊桥成人夜校妇女写信慰问赵桂兰
    首都和平门外第九区虎坊桥成人夜校的妇女们，听到教师讲述赵桂兰的故事后，非常感动，纷纷写信慰问。我们除将原信十一封直接寄交赵桂兰同志外，特选登以下三封。其中韩俞氏是四十九岁的家庭妇女。——编者亲爱的革命先锋赵桂兰同志：
    我是北京虎坊桥成人夜校的学生。三月三十日，刘老师给我们上国文课的时候说：今天我给大家讲一个女共产党员赵桂兰同志的故事。刘老师把同志你的故事从头至尾讲的很完全。我听完后觉得很难过，又想同志你的勇气真不小，为了保护我们人民的工厂，保护大家的生命，牺牲自己生命来保护咱们的建设，保护咱们人民的生命财产，这真是件伟大光荣的事情，真给咱们祖国劳动人民创造了一件光荣的事。我们人民都知道同志你的真心，你的勇气。我们不知道怎样感谢你才好。你真是我们劳动人民的模范。
    请你不要挂念你的文化程度低，好好的养病出院后我们拿出真心来帮助你学习。别不多叙。祝你早日出院！
                                                王宝春赵桂兰同志：
    自从我看到三月十三日人民日报所载：关于赵桂兰应不应扔“雷汞”一篇文章后，依我的意见看来你不扔“雷汞”是对的。因为刘少奇同志说的明白，不为别的，就是为了整个党的利益，在严重情况下，是应当牺牲自己，顾全国家的财产和利益的。你坚决执行了布尔什维克的原则。在党的教育下，你代表中国劳动妇女们作出一件轰轰烈烈的事。这是值得我们向你学习的。最后，我祝你早日恢复健康。并致敬礼！
                                            你的同志王秀珍桂兰同志：
    最近听见我们夜校的刘先生说你在工厂里受了很重的伤。医院里的大夫动手术把一只胳膊和一只手已经取掉了。我听了这样的消息当时吓的我就出了一身的冷汗，心里很难过。希望你在医院好好保养你的身体，等待痊愈之后，就凭你那灵敏的脑力和积极的工作精神，也能在新社会上为人民服务。你是国家有功有名的好英雄。不多写了，下次再谈。祝你病愈早些出院！
                                          你的同志韩俞氏启
