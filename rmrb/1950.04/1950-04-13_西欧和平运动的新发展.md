　　New Developments in the Western European Peace Movement
    Compiled by Cai Yingping
    Currently, under the leadership of the Communist Parties of Western European countries, the working people of these nations are actively engaging in organized actions to oppose the conspiracies of American and British imperialism to launch new wars of aggression. This anti-war peace movement is combined with the struggles of the people of Western European countries to win democratic freedom and national independence, and to fight for bread, work, and other social rights. Because of this, it has the power to attract millions of people to participate in this battle, and is increasingly becoming a broad mass movement.

    The leading force of the surging peace movement in Western Europe is the working class of the Western European countries, especially the working class of France and Italy. This class unites all patriotic and democratic strata, focusing its opposition on the aggression of American imperialism—against the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact; and also against the domestic reactionaries who are implementing this plan and pact, including the likes of Bidault and Blum in France, Gasperi and Saragat in Italy, Attlee and Bevin in Britain, and Adenauer and Schumacher in West Germany.

    In the course of the struggle, the masses have created many forms of struggle, among which the two most effective in striking at the warmongers are: one is the mass anti-war signature campaign, which, following the recent appeal by the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, has become a global form of struggle. The other is the refusal to load, unload, or transport war materials shipped by the United States to Western Europe. This struggle was first initiated by dockworkers in Saint-Nazaire, France, and quickly spread to dockworkers in ports in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and North Africa.

    In France, by the end of last year, 8 million people had directly participated in the peace movement. The French "Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace" held a meeting in Paris on January 6 this year, and put forward a program of struggle, demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs, universal disarmament, the cessation of the colonial war against the Vietnamese people, and that those who threaten the world with atomic war be judged as war criminals. This program of struggle was then taken to factories, mines, government offices, and rural areas across the country for publicity and discussion, mobilizing the masses to elect delegations to demand that local and central government personnel state their position on peace in person.

    At various ports and railway lines, workers cooperated to refuse to load, unload, or transport munitions to Vietnam to slaughter the Vietnamese people. Dockworkers in Nice threw V-2 rocket launchers into the sea. This year, near Cannes, a large group of women, with the help of workers, threw an entire trainload of tanks, destined to be shipped to Vietnam, off the train. Shipyard workers in Toulon and Lorient went on strike, refusing to repair ships to fight in Vietnam. When reactionaries sent troops to suppress the dockworkers, some soldiers refused to do so. For example, the entire artillery of the 701st Artillery Regiment, which was sent to the port of La Rochelle, expressed its support for the just actions of the dockworkers and refused to carry out orders from above.

    Currently, dockworkers in various French ports, including Marseille, Bordeaux, Lorraine, Nantes, La Rochelle, Dunkirk, Le Havre, Cherbourg, etc., and North African ports have organized a "Joint Action Committee" to unite and strike at the war preparation conspiracies of the American and French reactionaries. French railway workers are also acting in conjunction with dockworkers, expanding this struggle from the ports to all parts of France.

    The working people of Italy are also bravely participating in this battle. Last year, after the closure of the Paris-Prague World Congress of Supporters of Peace, Italian peace supporters immediately launched a widespread movement, using newspapers, radio, and various large and small gatherings to publicize the resolutions and declarations of the Congress. They organized thousands of local peace committees throughout the country; in the province of Bologna alone, there are 220 such organizations. When American imperialism was organizing the Atlantic Military Alliance, local peace committees launched a petition movement of seven million people, demanding that the government not participate in this aggressive alliance or the proposed Mediterranean Pact. When the Gasperi government signed the Atlantic Pact despite everything, angry protests poured in from all over the country. This was also an important factor that contributed to the government crisis in January of this year.

    Like the French people, the Italian people elected delegations to deliver the five-point peace program of the Permanent Committee to local governments and members of the upper and lower houses of parliament. In cities such as Milan, Livorno, Cosenza, and Ancona, the people forced the city councils to pass resolutions demanding a halt to the arms race, the abolition of atomic weapons, and the signing of a peace pact between the major powers. In the cities of Venice and Genoa, people held peace demonstrations, flying large peace slogans on the roofs of the American consulates. Dockworkers in Venice, Livorno, Bari, Taranto, and other seaports refused to unload war materials shipped from the United States, and this struggle was also supported and coordinated by railway workers.

    The peace movement in West Germany, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands has also seen considerable development. In the past few months, workers in major cities in West Germany have held many mass rallies, expressing their determination not to allow American imperialists to rearm West Germany and turn it into an important base for launching new wars. Ninety-seven thousand union members in Nuremberg passed a resolution condemning the governments of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the Potsdam and Yalta agreements, and opposing their establishment of reactionary armies in West Germany. In Britain, at the beginning of this year, 350 youth representatives held a "Youth Parliament" in London, deciding to fight for peace and demanding the immediate abolition of atomic weapons and the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers. In a recent march and demonstration in London, demonstrators hung two large banners on the roof of Parliament, one reading: "Ban the Atomic Bomb!" and the other with two large characters: "Peace!"

    The current peace movement in Western Europe is very different compared to before the Second World War. Before the war, the people of Western European countries also did not want war, but they did not organize themselves and use their actions to prevent the outbreak of war. Now they are not only organized around the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, continuously using mass propaganda, signature protests, strikes, demonstrations, and other means to strike at the war preparation attempts of the American and British warmongers, but, more importantly, the working class of each country has become increasingly active in participating in and leading this movement. It is precisely because this class and its party—the Communist Party—most resolutely and courageously oppose imperialism and its various conspiracies of war and enslavement, that this movement, under their leadership, can persevere, will not give up halfway, and will not go astray. With this correct leadership, the peace movement has a guarantee of victory. (April 4)

　　西欧和平运动的新发展
    蔡英平编
    目前，西欧各国的劳动人民正在各该国共产党的领导下，积极地以有组织的行动，反对美英帝国主义发动新侵略战争的阴谋。这个反战的和平运动，是和西欧各国人民争取民主自由与民族独立，争取面包、工作及其他社会权利的斗争结合起来的。正因为如此，它就有力量吸引千百万群众参加这个战斗，日益变为广泛的群众性的运动。
    西欧汹涌澎湃的和平运动的主导力量，是西欧各国的工人阶级，尤其是法国和意大利的工人阶级。这个阶级团结了所有爱国和民主的阶层，集中反对美帝国主义的侵略——反对马歇尔计划和大西洋公约；同时也反对执行这个计划和公约的国内反动派，包括法国的皮杜尔和勃鲁姆，意大利的加斯贝利和萨拉盖特，英国的艾德礼和贝文，西德的阿登纳和许马赫之流。
    在斗争过程中，群众创造了许多斗争方式，其中打击战争贩子最为有效的有两种，一种是群众性的反战签名运动，这种方式经由世界拥护和平大会常设委员会最近的号召后，已成为全世界性的一种斗争方式。另一种是拒绝装卸、运输美国运到西欧去的战争物资，这个斗争由法国圣纳赛尔港码头工人首先发起，很快地传布到法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、丹麦和北非各港口的码头工人中去。
    在法国，到去年年底为止，已有八百万人直接参加了和平运动。法国“争和平自由战士协会”今年一月六日在巴黎开会，提出了一个斗争纲领，要求禁止原子弹，普遍裁军，停止对越南人民的殖民地战争，并要求把那些用原子战争来威胁世界者判为战争罪犯。这个斗争纲领随即拿到全国各工厂、矿场、机关和农村中去宣传和讨论，发动群众选出代表团，当面要求各地方政府和中央政府的人员表明其对和平的立场。
    在各港口和铁路线上，工人们配合起来拒绝装卸或运输军火到越南去屠杀越南人民。尼斯的码头工人把外运的Ｖ—２火箭炮掷到海里去。今年，在坎城附近，一大群妇女在工人的帮助下把预备运到越南去的一整列火车的坦克都抛出车外。吐伦和罗利安的造船工人进行怠工，不修理船只去打越南。当反动分子派了军队去镇压码头工人时，有些兵士拒绝不干，例如被派往罗舍勒码头的第七○一炮兵团全体炮兵表示支持码头工人的正义行动，拒绝执行上级的命令。
    目前，法国各港口，包括马赛、波尔多、洛林、南特、罗舍勒、敦刻尔克、哈佛尔、瑟堡等和北非各港口的码头工人，已经组织了一个“联合行动委员会”，团结一致打击美法反动派的备战阴谋。法国的铁路工人也和码头工人联合行动，使这个斗争从港口扩展到全法各地。
    意大利的劳动人民同样勇敢地参加了这个战斗。去年，当巴黎——布拉格世界拥护和平大会闭幕以后，意大利的和平拥护者立即发动广泛的运动，用报纸、无线电和各种大小集会等方式宣传大会的决议和宣言。他们在各地组织了千百个地方和平委员会，单在波伦亚省就有二二○个这样的组织。在美帝国主义进行组织大西洋军事同盟时，各地和平委员会发动了七百万人的请愿运动，要求政府不参加这个侵略性的同盟或拟订中的地中海公约。当加斯贝利政府不顾一切在大西洋公约上签字时，愤怒的抗议从全国各地纷至沓来。这也是促使今年一月政府发生危机的一个重要因素。
    像法国人民一样，意大利人民选举了代表团把和大常设委员会的五项和平纲领送交各地政府和上下议院的议员。在米兰、里窝诺、科森纳和安科纳等城市中，人民迫着市参议会通过决议，要求停止军备竞赛，废止原子武器，并签订大国间的和平公约。在威尼斯和热那亚城，人民举行和平示威时，把大幅的和平标语飘扬到美国领事馆的屋顶上。威尼斯、里窝诺、巴里、大兰多和其它海港的码头工人，都拒卸从美国运来的战争物资，这个斗争同样获得铁路工人的响应和配合。
    和平运动在西德、英国、比利时和荷兰等国，都有了相当的发展。在过去几个月中，西德各大城市的工人们，曾举行了许多次群众性的大集会，表示决心不让美帝国主义者重新武装西德，把西德变为发动新战争的重要基地。努连堡有九万七千个工会会员通过决议，谴责美、英、法政府破坏波茨坦协定和雅尔塔协定，反对他们在西德成立反动的军队。在英国，今年年初，三百五十个青年代表在伦敦举行了“青年议会”，决定为和平而奋斗，要求立即废止原子武器，订立五大国的和平公约。在伦敦最近一次游行示威中，示威者把两面大旗挂在议院的屋顶上，一面写着：“禁止原子弹！”另一面写着两个大字：“和平！”
    目前西欧的和平运动，如果和第二次世界大战前比较起来，已有了很大的不同。战前，西欧各国的人民也不要战争，但是他们并没有组织起来，用自己的行动去阻止战争的爆发。现在他们不但已经组织在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的周围，不断地用群众宣传、签名抗议、罢工、示威等方式打击美英战争贩子的备战企图，而且更重要的是各国的工人阶级已经日益积极地参加与领导了这个运动。正由于这个阶级及其政党——共产党，最坚决、最勇敢地反对帝国主义及其各种战争和奴役的阴谋，因此，这个运动在他们领导之下，就能坚持下去，不会半途而废，也不会走入歧途。有了这个正确的领导后，和平运动才有了胜利的保障。（四月四日）
