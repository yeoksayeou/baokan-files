　　Introducing "The Poet Rainis"
    ——Excerpts from Speeches by Poetry Workers at a Film Forum on "The Poet Rainis"

Ai Qing:
    This film is very good and has great educational significance. This film portrays the Latvian poet Rainis transforming himself in the process of integrating with the masses. Initially, the poet meets a peasant named Rainis and sees him struggling uphill pulling a heavy cart without a horse. The poet offers the peasant money to buy a horse, but the peasant refuses and says, "This is not an individual's problem." This sentence has a deep and important meaning. The poet receives a profound education from this, so later he uses the peasant's name to write poetry. This means that only when the poet is first educated by the people can his creation in turn play an educational role among the people. Poet Rainis' creative activity貫穿了 is贯彻了the idea of "art should serve life and the people" from the great theorists including the Russian Belinsky. His contact with his lover reflects the struggle in literary and artistic thought between him and those who advocate "art for art's sake." This film also correctly resolves the relationship between love and politics, that they are not opposed, but when contradictions arise between them, Rainis turns to political struggle—because this is a cause related to the fate of the entire people, and precisely because of this, his lover admires him even more and follows him towards revolution.
    Rainis grew up among the working masses, under the education of the Party. He joined the working masses in demonstrations, comforted injured workers, and was imprisoned and exiled... Living such a life among the masses, living in the heat of struggle, his poetry was loved by the broad masses.
    This film also achieves a high degree of integration of political content and artistic skill. The strong lyrical atmosphere does not diminish the strong political content within it in the slightest. On the contrary, this lyrical atmosphere makes the poet's character and the life of political struggle better and more vividly expressed.
    This is one of the best Soviet films. This film teaches people that they should learn from the people and live and struggle with the people. I think not only should all literary and art workers watch this film, but all intellectuals, young students, cadres, workers, and even progressive citizens should watch this film.

Zang Kejia:
    After watching this film, I feel very close to it, especially for friends who are engaged in writing. The poet is also a fighter, a revolutionary. This also makes me think of the revolutionary tradition of Chinese poets and the struggles they have made for the cause of the people's liberation.
    We see that when he returns after his term of exile is over, thousands upon thousands of people gather at the station to welcome him. This scene, contrasted with his passionate and stirring situation in the courtroom, is very meaningful and moving. People who fight for the people are loved by the people. He is a poet, and he uses poetry to serve the revolution. In him, art and politics are combined, and the person and the poem are unified. People love his person and also love his poems.
    The whole film is very good and moving. It is of course very intimate for friends who write poetry, and it is also extremely educational for the general public.

Tian Jian:
    This film is well worth watching. After watching it myself, I feel that I have received a great education.
    Poet Rainis undergoes trials in prison, in court, in love, etc., overcomes various contradictions, and the relationship between the individual and the masses, and the relationship between the individual and the revolution, are all truthfully narrated in this film. From this film, one can see how a revolutionary worker (revolutionary poet) grows. From one person, one can also see a certain era. Its ideology seems clearer than in films like "Lermontov" and "Going to the People."
    Therefore, this film is not only worth watching for those who write poetry, but also for general literary and art workers, general cadres, and the general public. Don't think that this is a poet's film and not watch it. In fact, because "The Poet Rainis" has clear ideological content, and from a film technology perspective it also appears simple in image and rich in content, it doesn't seem difficult or unappealing just because it is a "poet's film."

Wu Kewen (General Representative of the Soviet Film Export Company):
    In the Soviet Union, the film "The Poet Rainis" has received high praise from audiences and the nation. Rainis is a model for literary and art workers and poets. I think introducing this poet to Chinese poets will also be helpful. In the film, the poet Rainis helps and encourages the masses in the revolutionary struggle. These will also educate Chinese audiences. The film translation and dubbing work of the Central Film Bureau is done very well, which can enable ordinary audiences to directly understand the content of Soviet films, eliminating language barriers, which is much more advanced than printing subtitles on films. I hope that artists and writers will help this work progress.

### 介绍《诗人莱尼斯》——诗歌工作者在《诗人莱尼斯》影片座谈会上发言摘录

　　介绍《诗人莱尼斯》
    ——诗歌工作者在《诗人莱尼斯》影片座谈会上发言摘录艾青：
    这部片子很好，有很大的教育意义。这个片子刻画了拉脱维亚诗人莱尼斯在与群众结合的过程中改造了自己。最初，诗人遇见农民莱尼斯，看见他没有马，拖着很重的车上坡，诗人送钱给农民买马，农民不要，而且说：“这不是一个人的问题。”这句话含义很深，很重要，诗人是从这里得到了深刻的教育的，所以后来他就借用这个农民的名字来写诗。这就是说，诗人只有首先从人民群众中得到教育，他的创作才能反转来在人民群众中起教育作用。诗人莱尼斯的创作活动，是贯穿了俄罗斯伯林斯基以来的伟大的理论家们的“艺术应该为人生，为人民群众服务”的思想的。他和他爱人的接触中，反映了他和“为艺术而艺术”的人之间的文艺思想上的斗争。这个片子也正确地解决了恋爱与政治的关系，它们不是对立的，但它们之间发生了矛盾的时候，莱尼斯走向政治斗争——因为这是有关于整个人民的命运的一种事业，也正因为这样做，才使得他的爱人更崇拜他，跟随他走向革命。
    莱尼斯是在工人群众中，在党的教育下成长起来的，他和工人群众一起，参加游行示威，慰问受伤工人，被监禁、流放……这样的生活在群众中，生活在火热的斗争中，他的诗才为广大群众所热爱。
    这个片子在技术方面也做到了政治性与艺术性的高度的结合。很浓厚的抒情气味，没有丝毫损害了里面的强烈的政治性，恰恰相反，这种抒情气味，使诗人的性格，政治斗争的生活，都得到了更好的、形象的表现。
    这是苏联的最好的影片中的一部。这个片子教育了人们应该向人民群众学习，和人民群众一起生活和斗争。我以为不但所有的文艺工作者都应该看这个片子，所有的知识分子、青年学生、干部、工人，以至要求进步的市民，都应该看这个片子。臧克家：
    看了这个片子感觉非常亲切，特别是对于从事写作的朋友们。诗人也就是战斗者，革命者。这也使我想到了中国诗人们革命的传统和为了人民解放事业而作过的斗争来。
    我们看到当他流放期满被释放回来时，在车站上聚集了成千成万的群众在欢迎他，这个场面和他在法庭上，那激昂慷慨的情况对照一下是很有意义，很动人的。为人民斗争的人，才被人民所热爱。他是诗人，他用诗来服务革命，在他，艺术和政治结合在一块了，人和诗统一了，人民爱他的人，也爱他的诗。
    整个的片子是很好的，动人的，它对写诗的朋友们固然很觉亲切，即使对一般人也极有教育的意义。田间：
    这部影片很值得我们看的。我自己看了以后，觉得受到一次很大的教育。
    诗人莱尼斯经过监狱、法庭、恋爱等等考验，战胜各种矛盾，个人与群众的关系，个人与革命的关系，在这一部片子中都有真实的叙述，从这部片子可以看出一个革命工作者（革命诗人）如何成长的，从一个人又可以看出某一个时代，它的思想性，好像比“莱蒙托夫”“到民间去”那几部片子更明确些。
    所以这部片子，不仅值得写诗的人去看，一般文艺工作者，一般干部都值得去看，一般的群众也值得去看，不要觉得这是诗人的片子，而不去看。其实，因为“诗人莱尼斯”思想性明确，从电影技术上看也是显得形象单纯，内容丰富，看起来并不因为是“诗人片子”就难看，不好看。邬克文（苏联电影输出公司总代表）：
    在苏联，诗人莱尼斯这个片子受到了观众和国家很高贵的赞扬。莱尼斯是文艺工作者诗人的榜样，我想介绍这个诗人给中国诗人也会有帮助。影片中的诗人莱尼斯在革命斗争中帮助鼓舞了群众，这些，也会使中国观众受到教育。中央电影局的影片翻译配音工作作的很好，能够使普通一般观众直接理解苏联影片的内容，消除了语言的隔阂，比片子印字幕进步多了。希望文艺家多帮助这个工作的进行。
