　　How to Calculate Electricity Consumption?
　　——Radio Station Responds to Readers Again

To the Editor:
    After the publication of our reply regarding the electricity consumption of radios in the People's Forum on April 8th, we received many letters and phone calls from listeners who felt that our answer was not specific enough. We will now explain in more detail as follows:

    In electrical engineering, electrical power is expressed as the product of voltage and current, and its unit is called the watt. If the voltage is one volt and the current is one ampere, the electrical power is one watt. In practical applications, this unit is often considered too small, so one thousand times one watt is also used as a unit, called a kilowatt. If one kilowatt of electricity is used for one hour, it is called one kilowatt-hour. Electricity companies charge according to this unit. Usually, one kilowatt-hour is also called one "degree," and sometimes it is called one "unit."

    Ordinary light bulbs are mostly marked with how many watts and how many volts. If it is a 50-watt light bulb, the electricity consumption per hour should be 50/1000, which is 1/20 of a degree. In other words, a 50-watt light bulb will use one degree of electricity in 20 hours. If it is a 100-watt light bulb, then the electricity consumption will be doubled. That is, a 100-watt light bulb will use one degree of electricity in 10 hours.

    Some radios are marked with how many watts, and some are marked with the voltage and current used. Generally speaking, an ordinary three-tube radio consumes about 25 watts, a four-tube radio consumes about 30 watts, and a five-tube radio consumes almost 40 watts. Therefore, a three-tube radio uses about one "unit" in 40 hours, a four-tube radio uses about one "unit" in 33 hours, and a five-tube radio uses about one "unit" in 25 hours.

　　如何计算用电量？
　　——广播电台再答读者编辑同志：
    四月八日人民园地刊出了我们关于收音机用电量问题的答复后，我们收到不少听众来信和电话，认为我们所答的还不具体。现在我们再详细的解释如下：
    在电学上，电工率是用电压和电流的乘积来表示的，它的单位叫作瓦特，如果电压是一伏特，电流是一安培，电工率就是一瓦特。在实际应用上，常嫌这个单位太小，所以也用一瓦特的一千倍来做单位，叫作千瓦。一千瓦的电，如果用了一小时，叫作一个千瓦小时，电灯公司就是按照这个单位来收费，平常一个千瓦小时也叫作一度，有时又叫一个字。
    普通电灯泡上，多注明是多少瓦特，及多少伏特。如果是一只五十瓦特的电灯泡，每小时用电应当是千分之五十也就是二十分之一度。换句话说就是一个五十瓦特的灯泡，二十个钟头要用一度电。假如是一百瓦特的灯泡，那么所用的电就要费一倍了。也就是一百瓦特的灯泡十个钟头就用一度电。
    有些收音机上面注明是多少瓦特，也有些注明使用电压和电流的。一般来讲，普通一只三个真空管的收音机，大约用电二十五瓦特左右，一只四管机，大约在三十瓦特左右，五管机差不多有四十瓦特，所以说，三管收音机，大约四十个钟头用一个字。四管机大约三十三个钟头用一个字。五管机大概有二十五个钟头，就可以用一个字。
