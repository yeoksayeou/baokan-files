　　"Study" Magazine Volume II, Issue 3 to be Published
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The third issue of the second volume of "Study" magazine will be published on the 16th. This issue publishes Tian Jiaying's "Learning Scientific Leadership Methods." In this article, the author quotes the basic arguments of Chairman Mao's "Decision of the Central Committee on Methods of Leadership" to analyze the subjectivism and bureaucracy that are prevalent in various aspects of work. It points out that we should learn the scientific methods taught by Chairman Mao in the "Decision of the Central Committee on Methods of Leadership" to improve incorrect work methods and styles. It also publishes Wang Huide's "What is the Most Basic Law of Social Development?" and Shen Zhiyuan's "Grasping the Essence of Capitalist Exploitation." The former explains in a simple and clear way what the most basic law of social development is, correcting certain errors or vague views in some books regarding the laws of social development and the driving forces of development. The latter explains in detail some basic issues in Chapter 4 of Leontief's "Political Economy." These two articles are very helpful for studying the history of social development and political economy. The "Questions and Answers" column in this issue answers questions such as: "What is a commodity? Must a product produced for the purpose of exchange be considered a commodity?" "Why does the increase in the organic composition of capital lead to relative overpopulation?" "Where do the specific differences lie between the Kemalist revolution in Turkey and the Chinese revolution?" "Several questions about land reform," "What are the differences between our taxation and the Kuomintang's taxation?" and other questions. The "Learning Experience" column in this issue introduces experiences in holding learning lectures, leading learning seminars, and studying newspapers. In addition, there are articles such as Fei Xiaotong's "On Purely Technical Viewpoints," Fan Ruoyu's "Why Am I Not Interested in Studying Politics?" and columns such as "Words and Thoughts," "Reader's Notes," and "Study Notes," including a total of more than twenty articles.

　　《学习》杂志第二卷第三期将出版
    【本报讯】《学习》杂志第二卷第三期将于十六日出版。这一期发表了田家英的《学习科学的领导方法》，在这篇文章里，作者引用毛主席所写的《中央关于领导方法的决定》的基本论点，来分析目前各方面工作中普遍存在着的主观主义和官僚主义作风，指出应当学习毛主席在《中央关于领导方法的决定》里所教导我们的科学方法来改进错误的工作方法和作风。并发表了王惠德的《什么是社会发展最基本的规律？》及沈志远的《把握资本主义剥削的实质》两文，前者通俗地、明确地说明了究竟什么是社会发展最基本的规律的问题，纠正了某些书本上的关于社会发展规律和发展动力问题的错误或模糊观点。后者详尽地解释了列昂节夫《政治经济学》第四章的一些基本问题。这两篇文章，对于学习社会发展史和政治经济学都是很有帮助的。这一期的《问题解答》栏，解答了：“什么是商品，是不是一定要以交换为目的而生产出来的生产物才算是商品？”“何以说资本有机构成的提高造成相对的人口过剩？”、“土耳其基马尔式的革命与中国革命具体不同处在那里？”、“关于土改的几个问题”、“我们的税收与国民党的税收有什么区别？”等问题。这一期的《学习经验》栏介绍了关于举办学习讲演会、关于领导学习讨论会、关于学习报纸等经验。此外尚有费孝通的《论纯技术观点》、范若愚的《为什么对学习政治没有兴趣？》等文及《文字与思想》、《读者笔谈》、《学习笔记》等专栏，共包括文章二十余篇。
