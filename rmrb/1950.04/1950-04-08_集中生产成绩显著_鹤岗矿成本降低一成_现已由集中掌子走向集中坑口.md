　　Remarkable Achievements in Centralized Production:
    Hegang Mine Reduces Costs by 10%;
    Now Moving from Centralized Workfaces to Centralized Pitheads

    [This Newspaper] News: Our newspaper's special correspondent Xu Tiemin reports: Since the Northeast Hegang Coal Mine boldly implemented centralized production management last November, concentrating three hundred and fifty scattered workfaces into one hundred and thirty-six workfaces, due to the increased efficiency of machinery, increased output, and reduced consumption, the production cost in January has decreased by 9.48% compared to the end of November before centralized production. In order to further implement the policy of centralized production, the mine has begun a process of highly centralized concentration of pitheads in March, moving from centralized workfaces to centralized pitheads.
    Before the centralized production, the total mechanical equipment was 23,239 horsepower, of which 15,980 horsepower were in use; after centralization, the amount of equipment decreased by 15.9%, and the amount in use decreased by 13.4%, but in terms of efficiency, each ton of coal required 0.68 horsepower less than before, while each horsepower could produce 0.15 tons more coal than before. From the perspective of average daily output and average output per worker, the average daily coal production before centralization was 6,000 tons, with each worker producing 1.97 tons; after centralization, the average daily output has increased to 7,200 tons, with each worker producing 2.83 tons, an increase of 43.7% compared to before. The proportion of mining and tunneling has also improved the unreasonable phenomenon of more tunneling than mining before centralization. With the concentration of workfaces, safety work has also been strengthened compared to before, reducing the occurrence of accidents. Before centralization, except for the four mechanical Tonghua inclined shafts, the remaining pitheads had less than three cubic meters of wind per minute; after centralization, seventeen out of twenty-eight inclined shafts had three to ten cubic meters, and eleven had ten to thirty cubic meters. Due to the increase in air volume, gas has been relatively reduced, and the casualty rate has been reduced from 11 injuries and 0.176 deaths per 10,000 tons of coal before centralization to 6.8 injuries per 10,000 tons of coal. In terms of consumption, except for the increase in gunpowder consumption due to the change in the regular backfilling method of coal mining, which requires roof picking, other consumptions have generally decreased, so the production cost in January has been reduced by 9.48% compared to before centralization, and by 9.3% compared to the original plan. This ironclad fact proves that implementing the policy of centralized production in coal mine management is a fundamental link in implementing economic accounting and reducing costs.
    The mine has indeed achieved many successes in centralized production, but because this is a new exploration process, there are still many shortcomings in the work. The main problem is that the mechanical efficiency has not yet been brought into play to the due efficiency, and waste is still very serious. For example, with the existing equipment, it can produce 11,000 tons per day, but currently only produces 7,200 tons of coal, so the actual mechanical efficiency is only 60%. On the one hand, the operation of the machinery itself is poor, and on the other hand, the coal output from the pithead is insufficient, which also prevents the winch efficiency from being brought into play. To fully utilize mechanical efficiency, in addition to improving operating skills and strengthening the training of technical personnel, the pitheads must be further concentrated to further exert the efficiency of centralized use of machinery. Therefore, in the process of revising and studying the 1950 production plan in March, Hegang proposed a plan to further concentrate the pitheads: in the second quarter production plan, the current twenty-eight inclined shafts will be changed into a more concentrated twenty inclined shafts, combined with the cultivation of mechanized (main pithead) pitheads, so that the machinery can be focused on the main pitheads, first making all the main pitheads mechanized, and striving to achieve 80% mechanized coal mining in the entire mine today.

### 集中生产成绩显著  鹤岗矿成本降低一成  现已由集中掌子走向集中坑口

　　集中生产成绩显著
    鹤岗矿成本降低一成
    现已由集中掌子走向集中坑口
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员许铁民报道：东北鹤岗煤矿自去年十一月大胆实行生产集中管理，由三五○个分散的掌子集中为一三六个掌子后，由于提高了机械效能，增加了产量，减少了消耗，一月份生产成本已较去年十一月末集中生产前降低百分之九·四八。为进一步贯彻集中生产的方针，该矿三月份已开始由集中掌子走向集中坑口的高度集中过程。
    该矿在集中生产前，全部机械设备二三、二三九马力，运用了一五、九八○马力；集中后设备量减少百分之一五·九马力，运用量减少百分之一三·四马力，但在效率上，集中后每吨煤较前减少○·六八马力，而每马力可较前增产煤○·一五吨。从平均日产量及平均每工产率来看，集中前平均日产煤六、○○○吨，每工合一·九七吨；集中后平均日产量已增为七、二○○吨，每工合二·八三吨，较前提高百分之四三·七。在采掘比例上，也改进了集中前掘进煤量多于采煤量的不合理现象。随着掌子的集中，保安工作亦较前加强，减少了事故的发生。集中前除四个机械通化斜坑外，其余坑口每分钟都不到三立方米风；集中后，二十八个斜坑中三立方米到十立方米者十七个坑口，十立方米到三十立方米者十一个坑口。由于风量增加，瓦斯则相对减少，伤亡率已由集中前每万吨煤伤十一人，亡○·一七六人，减为每万吨煤伤六·八人。在消耗上，除因改变正规回采采煤方法，需要挑顶而增加火药消耗外，其他消耗均普遍降低，因而一月份生产成本已较集中前减低百分之九·四八，较原计划减低百分之九·三。这一铁的事实证明：在煤矿经营上实行集中生产的方针，是贯彻经济核算，减低成本的基本环节。
    该矿在集中生产上确实收到了不少成绩，但由于这是一个新的摸索的过程，在工作中仍有许多缺点。其中主要问题是机械效能还未发挥到应有的能率，浪费仍很严重。如以现有设备可日产一一、○○○吨，目前只产煤七、二○○吨，故机械效率实际发挥百分之六十。这一方面是机械本身的运用操作不良，另方面坑口出煤量不足，也使绞车能率不能发挥。要充分发挥机械效能，除提高操作技术，加强培养技术人员外，必须使坑口再加集中，进一步发挥机械集中使用的效能。因之鹤岗在三月份修正研究一九五○年生产计划中，又提出进一步集中坑口的计划：准备在第二季生产计划中，把目前二十八个斜坑变为较集中的二十个斜坑，结合培养机械化（主要坑口）坑口，把机械有重点的配合到主力坑口，先使主力坑口全部做到机械化，并争取在今天全矿做到百分之八十的机械化采煤。
