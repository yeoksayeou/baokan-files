　　Overview of Transaction Tax Collection in Beijing
　　By our reporter Lin Hong

　　(1) The Origin of Transaction Tax
　　Transaction tax is a new tax that originated in the old liberated areas of North China during the Anti-Japanese War. It was mainly levied on buyers in rural market towns. Years of experience have shown that this tax plays a significant role in strengthening market management and reducing the heavy feudal exploitation of both buyers and sellers by middlemen such as brokers; the tax revenue has also gradually occupied a considerably important position in the entire tax revenue. Beijing Municipality began collecting transaction tax in the market towns of the suburbs from April 15, 1949, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Transaction Tax" promulgated by the former North China People's Government. According to the principle of "no double taxation on goods," industrial and commercial tax is no longer collected in the suburbs.

　　(2) The Process of Collection in the City
　　Could transaction tax be collected in cities, especially large cities like Beijing? Many people believed that the urban environment was complex, and problems might arise. The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau was cautious and lacked experience in collecting taxes in the city, so it was not in a hurry to proceed. It was not until October 15 of last year that the Municipal Taxation Bureau decided to first collect transaction tax on livestock transactions in the city, while continuing to collect industrial and commercial tax on other items.

　　The existence of two different taxes within Beijing, separated by a single city wall, gave speculative merchants an opportunity to exploit loopholes. Grain is a major consumer product in the city. Because transaction tax was not levied in the city and industrial and commercial tax was not levied in the suburbs, grain merchants bought grain in the city and then transported it to the suburbs to sell. In this way, merchants evaded both transaction tax and industrial and commercial tax, while also creating an abnormal reverse flow of materials.

　　How should this problem be solved? The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, the Commercial Bureau, and other relevant departments discussed this before and after the large-scale collection of grain transaction tax in the city on December 15. Finally, a consensus was reached. First, regarding the issue of "double taxation," because transaction tax is levied on the buyer, business tax is levied on the business turnover of the sedentary merchants, and industrial and commercial tax is levied on the business turnover of the itinerant merchants (similar in nature to business tax), the three are not repetitive. Second, would this stimulate price increases? In the past, when grain, livestock, etc., were traded, brokers and intermediaries heavily exploited both buyers and sellers. Now that this has been eliminated and only a small transaction tax is levied, this will definitely not stimulate price increases. The result of Beijing's collection of livestock transaction tax in the city on December 15 powerfully proves this point. Looking at the market price of meat, the price was slightly lower after the collection of livestock transaction tax than before. As for the issue of being unsuitable for urban conditions, this is a conservative idea, and in fact, it is entirely possible and should be carried out in cities.

　　Based on the above understanding and with the approval of the leading authorities, the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, in addition to continuing to collect industrial and commercial tax in the city, universally began collecting transaction tax in the city on January 6 of this year. Due to the small transaction volume of native cloth and cotton, they are temporarily not subject to tax. At the same time, the collection of industrial and commercial tax was also resumed in the suburbs. The transaction tax revenue in January was more than 1.02 million jin of millet, an increase of 2.2 times compared to the period before the universal collection in December, occupying an important position in the regular tax revenue.

　　(3) Collection Situation
　　The transactions of grain and livestock in Beijing are mainly concentrated in several markets. The grain markets are located at the Four Faces Clock, Xizhimen, and Xian Nong Tan. The daily transaction volume at the Four Faces Clock ranges from 700,000 jin to 1.4 million jin. The daily transaction volume at Xizhimen is approximately 50,000 jin. The method of transaction and taxation for both is as follows: there are no traders; buyers and sellers negotiate directly, and the seller displays the goods samples on the stall and indicates the price. After the transaction is completed, the goods are picked up at the warehouse, and the transaction tax is deducted by the seller (grain warehouse). Xian Nong Tan is a spot grain transaction with a daily transaction volume of approximately 200,000 jin. The transaction is completed by traders, and after weighing, the tax bureau's on-site receiver directly collects the tax. The Beijing Grain Corporation's operating profit from wholesale purchases is subject to transaction tax. The tax bureau has sent two cadres to the company to directly collect the tax. On the one hand, the company is spared the trouble of collecting the tax on its behalf, and on the other hand, the tax bureau reduces the expenditure on handling fees.

　　The livestock markets include the Mule and Horse Market outside Deshengmen, the Madian Cattle and Sheep Market, and the Pig Shop Industry, etc., which are all composed of the original mule and horse shops, cattle and sheep shops, etc., and transaction tax is collected on their behalf by the traders.

　　(4) Several Experiences
　　Based on the past collection situation, the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau has gained several experiences in doing a good job in collecting transaction tax in the city:

　　First, strengthening market management and the transformation and education of traders are important links in doing a good job in the collection of transaction tax. In the larger markets in Beijing, there were original tax and management institutions; the former was mainly responsible for taxation, and the latter was responsible for market management. In order to further combine them, it is planned to form a market management committee in accordance with the provisions of the tax law. Before the collection of transaction tax in each market, the registration of brokers, intermediaries, etc., should be handled first. After registration, a certificate will be issued, and they can serve as traders under the unified leadership of the market management committee. In the initial stage, the number of traders was large, and the handling fees extracted by each person each day according to regulations were insufficient to maintain their livelihood; and the market did not need so many people. Later, those with good quality and a positive attitude were retained, and the rest were introduced to other professions. In addition to formulating measures to reward good traders, the market management committee should also pay attention to their transformation and education at any time, so that the phenomenon of smuggling and tax evasion will not easily occur.

　　Second, pay attention to the registration and management of industry associations, and conduct surprise inspections when necessary to find out whether there are any tax evasion behaviors from the industry association's customer accounts.

　　Third, transaction tax should not only be grasped from the seller (mainly industry associations), but also attention should be paid to the buyer. For example, the collection of grain transaction tax can also find out whether there are any tax evasion behaviors in the city by checking the purchase accounts of rice and flour industry, powder mills, sugar mills, and pastry industry.

　　Fourth, livestock transaction tax should be combined with slaughter tax. Whenever pigs, cattle, sheep, mules, horses, etc., are required to have a breeding certificate, a road pass, or enter the slaughterhouse, they must present a transaction tax payment certificate.

　　京市交易税征收概况
    本报记者  林洪
    （一）交易税的起源
    交易税是一项新的税收，起源于抗日战争期间的华北老解放区。它主要是在乡村的集镇上向买方课征的。多年的经验证明：这一税收对于加强市场管理、减少牙纪等中间人对买卖双方苛重的封建性剥削有很大作用；税款的收入也逐渐在整个的税收中，占据了相当重要的地位。北京市根据前华北人民政府颁布的交易税暂行办法，于一九四九年四月十五日起始，在城郊的集镇上开征。根据“货不重征”的原则，在郊区不再征收行商税。
            （二）城内开征经过
    交易税能否在城市特别是像北京这样大的城市征收呢？许多人认为城市环境复杂，恐怕会出问题。北京市税务局为了慎重，同时也缺乏在城市征收的经验，没有急于进行。直到去年十月十五日，市税务局才决定先在城内开征牲畜交易税，其余仍照征行商税。
    京市由于一城之隔而存在着两种不同的税收，就给了投机商人钻空子的机会。粮食是城市的大宗消费品。因为城内不上交易税，郊区不上行商税，粮商就在城内买粮，再运到城外去卖。这样，商人既逃避了交易税，又逃避了行商税；同时造成了不正常的物资倒流的现象。
    这一个问题应如何解决呢？京市于十二月十五日在城内大部开征粮食交易税前后，税务局、商业局及其他有关部门曾讨论过。最后取得了一致的认识。首先关于“重税”的问题。因交易税是征自买方，营业税征自座商的营业流水，行商税则征自行商的营业流水（性质同于营业税），三者并不重复。其次，是否会因此刺激物价上涨呢？过去粮食、牲畜等于成交时，牙行牙纪对买卖双方剥削苛重。现在取消了，而只征轻微的交易税，这绝不会刺激物价上涨。京市十二月十五日在城内开征牲畜交易税的结果，有力地证明了这一点。以肉类的市场价格来看，开征牲畜交易税后，价格反较前微落。至于不适合城市情况的问题，则是一种保守思想，实际上是完全可以而且应该在城市进行的。
    基于以上认识，并经领导机关批准后，京市税务局除在城内照征行商税外，于今年一月六日在城内普遍开征了交易税，土布、棉花因交易额小，暂不征收。与此同时，在郊区也恢复征收行商税。一月份交易税收入为一百零二万余斤小米，与十二月份未普遍开征前相较，增加了二点二倍，在经常性的税收中，占着一个重要地位。
            （三）征收情形
    京市粮食、牲畜的交易主要集中在几个市场。粮食市场有四面钟、西直门及先农坛三处。四面钟每日成交量在七十万斤到一百四十万斤之间。西直门每日成交量约五万斤。两者交易和征税的方式是：无交易员，由买卖双方直接谈判，卖方将货样摆在摊上并标明价码。成交后到货栈提货，即由卖方（粮栈）代扣交易税。先农坛是现粮交易，每日成交量约二十万斤。由交易员代为成交，过秤后，报由税局在场的经收人直接征收。北京粮食分公司所经营的粮食，批购营利部分照征交易税。税局派了两个干部到该公司直接征收，一方面该公司省去了代征的麻烦，同时税局也减少了手续费开支。
    牲畜市场有德胜门外骡马市场、马甸牛羊市场及猪店业等，均由原来的骡马店、牛羊店等组成，由各交易员代征交易税。
            （四）几点经验
    根据过去征收的情形，京市税务局取得了在城市作好征收交易税的几点经验：
    第一、加强市场管理和对交易员的改造教育，是作好交易税征收工作的重要环节。京市较大的市场上原有税收与管理机构的设立，前者主要负责征税，后者负责市场管理。现为进一步结合起见，拟依照税法的规定，合组市场管理委员会，每一市场在开征交易税前，先办理牙纪、牙行等人的登记。登记后发给证件，便可以在市场管理委员会的统一领导下担任交易员。初期，交易员的数量较多，每人每日按规定提取的手续费，不足维持生活；而市场也不需要这许多人。后来，将品质好、工作积极的人继续留用，其余的都分别介绍转业。市场管理委员会除应制订办法奖励好的交易员外，并要随时注意对他们的改造教育，这样走私漏税的现象便不易发生。
    第二、注意行栈的登记管理，必要时可进行突击检查，从行栈的往来户上，可发现是否有偷漏税的行为。
    第三、交易税不但要从卖方（主要是行栈）掌握，还应注意买方。如粮食交易税的征收，从检查米面粮业、粉房业、糖房业、糕点业等的进货账上，也能发现在本市成交的粮食，是否有偷漏交易税的现象。
    第四、牲畜交易税应与屠宰税结合掌握。凡猪、牛、羊、骡马等在起长养票或路引或入屠宰场时，应提出交易税完税证。
