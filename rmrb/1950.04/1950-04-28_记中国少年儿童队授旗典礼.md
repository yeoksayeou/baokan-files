    A Record of the Flag Conferral Ceremony of the Chinese Young Pioneers
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    The military band struck up a brisk march, the doors of the hall opened, and two teams of boys and girls, beating Western drums and carrying red flags, marched in with neat steps. The red scarves gleamed around their necks, and the five stars and torches together radiated light on the red silk flags. "Young Pioneers!" people cheered!
    These children felt their happiness and glory, their faces flushed, their eyes shining, and they walked briskly to the stage, unfolded the two team flags, paid tribute to the New Democratic Youth League, which was entrusted by the Party to be responsible for cultivating and educating the young pioneers of New China, and presented flowers that rivaled the youth of the children!
    Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, stood on the stage with a gentle smile, gazing kindly at these happy children. Just two hours earlier, he had told here the glorious history of the children's organizations that were the predecessors of the brave Young Pioneers: during the Great Revolution, there were "Labor Children's Corps" who, together with the urban workers, carried out heroic struggles under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Socialist Youth League; during the ten years of the Land Revolution and the eight years of the War of Resistance, the deeds of the children's corps members in the revolutionary base areas standing guard, keeping watch, and checking road passes were the stories that children in other parts of China and around the world yearned for the most. Now, with the development of the victorious situation of the revolution, the young pioneers of New China will be organized in the tens of thousands, just like this group of children in front of us.
    Two little girls dressed in Xinjiang ethnic minority costumes appeared on the stage. Although people had seen Xinjiang brothers and sisters more than once, they couldn't help but cheer happily in a low voice when they saw this pair of beautiful children with long braids and wearing small, colorful silk caps. When the hall began to quiet down, the smaller girl stood in front of the microphone and recited her tribute in Kazakh. She said that she was a Kazakh girl from the Tianshan grasslands, and she represented the children of Xinjiang in paying tribute to the children of the whole country. She was willing to represent the children of Xinjiang in promising to study hard and exercise well in order to build a free and happy life. She said that the children of Xinjiang and the children of the whole country were one family. Her short and innocent wishes aroused a storm of applause from the audience. People saw from her unrestrained speech the prospect of the children of all ethnic groups in New China loving and uniting each other and moving towards a happy future together.
    The flag of the Young Pioneers was unfurled—red—the victory of the revolution; five-pointed star—the leadership of the Communist Party; torch—a bright future. The fact is just like this: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the young pioneers of New China will inevitably move towards a bright future.
    The song of the Young Pioneers, with lyrics by Mr. Guo Moruo and music by Ma Sicong, president of the Central Conservatory of Music, was sung loudly by the children of the Youth Art Theater. Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, awarded the glorious red scarves of victory to the cadres of the Young Pioneers work in various regions. Soon they and the presidium on the stage all wore red scarves. Wearing the red scarves, they dispersed to bring this glorious banner to millions of children in various places!
    "Be prepared: to struggle for the cause of building the motherland, to realize Chairman Mao's great ideals!" Comrade He Li, Minister of the Youth and Children's Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, shouted the first team call of the Chinese Young Pioneers. "Always prepared!" More than 100 cadres from all over the country, representing 478,000 young pioneers work cadres, answered in unison. This is the fighting team call and answer of the Chinese Young Pioneers. Soon, millions of young pioneers across the country will shout the same voice. They will advance with this voice and march towards a bright and splendid tomorrow!

　　记中国少年儿童队授旗典礼
    本报记者  金凤
    军乐奏起了轻快的进行曲，大厅的门开了，两队男女孩子打着洋鼓，拿着红旗，踏着整齐的脚步走了进来。红领巾在他们的颈上闪光，五星和火炬在红绸旗上一起吐露着光明。“少年儿童队员”，人们欢呼了起来！
    这些孩子们感觉到自己的幸福和光荣，脸上浮起一片红晕，眼睛闪闪发亮，矫健地走到台前，将两面队旗展开，向着受着党的委托，负责培养教育新中国少年儿童的新民主主义青年团致敬，献上了和孩子们的青春争辉的鲜花！
    站在台上的青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志，带着温和的微笑，亲切地凝视着这一批幸福的孩子们。就在两个钟头以前，他在这里讲述过勇敢的少年儿童队前身的儿童组织的光荣历史：在大革命时候，和城市的工人一起，在中国共产党和社会主义青年团的领导下进行着英勇的斗争的，有“劳动童子团”；在十年土地革命和八年抗战时期，革命根据地的儿童团员站岗、放哨、查路条的事迹，是中国其他地区和世界各国的儿童们最向往的故事。现在，随着革命胜利形势的发展，新中国的少年儿童们将要成千成万地组织起来，像眼前这一群孩子一样。
    两个穿着新疆少数民族服装的小姑娘出现在台上。虽然人们已经不只一次地看过新疆的兄弟姊妹，但看到这一对有着长长的发辫，戴着那五彩锦绸的小圆帽的美丽的孩子们，还是禁不住快乐得低声欢呼起来。当大厅开始肃静，那个更小的女孩子就站在扩音器前，用哈萨克语念出了她的祝献。她说她是从天山草原来的哈萨克姑娘，她代表新疆的小朋友向全国的小朋友致敬。她愿意代表新疆的小朋友们保证为建立自由幸福的生活而好好学习，好好锻炼自己。她说新疆的小朋友和全国的小朋友是一家人。她的简短的天真的祝辞，引起了全场暴风雨似的掌声。人们从她的无拘束的讲辞里，看到了新中国各族儿童友爱团结，共同走向幸福未来的远景。
    少年儿童队的队旗展了开来——红色——革命的胜利；五角星——共产党的领导；火炬——光明的未来。事实正是这样，新中国的少年儿童，在中国共产党的领导下必然走向光明的未来。
    由郭沫若先生作词，中央音乐学院院长马思聪作曲的少年儿童队队歌，由青年艺术剧院的孩子们嘹亮地唱了起来。青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志把光荣的胜利的红领巾，授给各地区的少年儿童工作的干部。很快地他们和台上的主席团都带上了红领巾。他们带着红领巾，散开去，要把这光荣的标帜带给各地千百万的孩子们！
    “准备着：为建设祖国的事业，为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗”！青年团中央委员会少年儿童部部长何礼同志喊出了中国少年儿童队第一声的队呼。“时刻准备着”！台下一百多位来自全国各地、代表着四十七万八千少年儿童工作干部齐声回答着。这是中国少年儿童队的战斗的队呼和回答，不久，全国将有千百万少年儿童喊出这同样的声音。他们将要随着这声音前进，向光明灿烂的明天进军！
