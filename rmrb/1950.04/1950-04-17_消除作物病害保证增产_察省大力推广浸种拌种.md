　　Eliminate Crop Diseases and Guarantee Increased Production
    Chahar Province Vigorously Promotes Seed Soaking and Seed Dressing

    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Comprehensive reports from various locations in Chahar Province: In order to eliminate crop diseases and guarantee increased production, the province is vigorously promoting seed soaking and seed dressing. Crop diseases have occurred in the province for many years, especially wheat, naked oats, corn smut (or anthracnose), millet and other diseases such as head smut, which are quite common and serious. For example, last year in Chahar North, where wheat anthracnose was the most severe, production was reduced by as much as 70%; the average reduction was also 30-40%, becoming an important factor in last year's production decline. The province's agricultural production conference decided to promote agricultural science and technology as one of the important measures to complete this year's production increase task. Leaders at all levels also attach great importance to this. The Chahar North, Yanbei, and Chahar South Prefectural Offices all held special meetings to impart the use of warm water soaking scientific equipment to cadres at the prefectural level. The Yanbei Prefectural Office then dispatched cadres to Datong and seven other counties to promote seed soaking and seed dressing technology. At the beginning of last month, the Provincial Department of Agriculture also dispatched more than 20 agricultural technicians, focusing on Chahar North, and went to various prefectures in three groups to inspect this work and assist various counties in promotion. As of now, more than 170 cadres have been dispatched to the countryside to promote this work. In addition to conducting extensive publicity in conjunction with recreational activities during the Spring Festival, various counties have also convened people's representative conferences, expanded cadre meetings, Communist Youth League representative conferences, women's representative conferences, and other meetings at the county and district levels, explaining the benefits of seed soaking and seed dressing, imparting technology, and conducting on-the-spot experiments, greatly boosting confidence in increasing production. The representatives all said: "We have mastered the knack, we must publicize it well and teach everyone to soak seeds." After returning to the villages, the representatives actively took the lead with cadres, Party members, and League members to promote and experiment with the masses, using examples to break the superstitions, conservatism, and wait-and-see attitudes among the masses. For example, in Chicheng County, under the leadership of the people's representatives, Party members, and cadres, 145 villages have successfully experimented with seed soaking. Wang Yue, a people's representative in Xiaozhuangzi Village (and the village's Party branch secretary), mobilized the masses, saying: "Seed soaking is not difficult, as long as you master the time and temperature." Once the experiment was done, the seeds sprouted, which influenced every household in the village to prepare for seed soaking. In order to train a large number of technicians to carry out the promotion work, various counties have also held cadre training courses. In the eleven counties of Yanbei and Xuanhua County alone, the cadre training courses have taught more than 12,000 people. In Wanquan and Yangyuan, there are one to three technical extension workers in each village, ensuring the smooth progress of the promotion work. In addition, in order to solve the problem of medicines and equipment required for seed soaking and seed dressing, the province purchased and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government distributed 180 dozen thermometers (for warm water soaking), with each district in control of four to seven. 270,000 jin of alcohol for seed dressing has also been purchased, which can meet the needs of 1.5 million mu of land, all of which are supplied to Chahar North. Yanbei and Chahar North have also prepared a batch of good wine themselves, and the provincial government has prepared 85 seed dressing machines, which have been distributed to various prefectures. In order to facilitate the masses to learn seed soaking and seed dressing methods, 15,000 copies of popular science picture books are being printed and distributed. At present, the seed soaking and seed dressing work in the province has been extended to households and has achieved some results. For example, in Xuanhua County, an average of two-tenths of the masses in each village have learned the technology, and among the 6,300 mu of wheat planted in Zhuolu urban area, 5,390 mu of seeds have been soaked. However, there are still many shortcomings. For example, at the people's representative conference in Yanqing County, when conducting seed soaking experiments, because the person in charge of the experiment did not pay attention to preserving the seeds, the seeds did not sprout, which did not eliminate the representatives' ideological concerns, and the seed soaking work could not be widely carried out. In the Mantouying District of Zhangbei, the cadre Chen Hua learned the technology but did not convey it, and the leadership did not pay attention to it either. The village chief of Taifu Village in Zhuolu did not patiently promote the experiment, but monitored it at the village entrance, and if anyone planted wheat without soaking the seeds, he would not let them plant it. Some people planted it secretly, and the village chief forced them to beat gongs and parade through the streets to confess their mistakes to the masses. Fan Chunbao, a cadre in the Xiacang District of Longguan, could not do anything because he had not learned the technology himself, and watched the masses plant wheat without soaking the seeds. Even more harmful is the blind transmission of knowledge. For example, Liang Shengying, the Party branch secretary of Daxi Village in Zhuolu County, led three households to soak the seeds for seven and a half mu of wheat, but because they only soaked them in hot water, none of them sprouted. From the above examples, it can be seen that some district and village leaders in some counties do not have a serious and responsible attitude towards promoting seed soaking work, but adopt bureaucratic methods of forcing orders without earnestly learning the technology themselves. Facts have proved that this approach cannot do the work well. In particular, when establishing a new scientific habit, we should carry out in-depth, patient and repeated publicity, and use examples to educate the masses, so that the masses can appreciate its benefits and take action.

　　消除作物病害保证增产
    察省大力推广浸种拌种
    【本报讯】综合察哈尔省各地报道：为了消除作物病害保证增产，该省正大力推广浸种、拌种。该省作物病害历年发生，特别是小麦、莜麦、玉米的黑穗病（或黑疽病）、谷子的白发病等，相当普遍而严重。如去年察北小麦黑疽病最严重的地方，减产竟达百分之七十；一般减产平均也在百分之三、四十，成为去年减产的一个重要因素。该省农业生产会议上，即决定把推广农业科学技术作为完成今年增产任务的重要措施之一。各级领导机关对此亦十分重视。察北、雁北、察南专署均专门召开了会议，对专区级干部传授了温汤浸种科学器械之使用，雁北专署随即抽调干部分赴大同等七县推广浸种拌种技术。该省农业厅亦在上月初旬抽调农业技术干部二十余人，以察北为重点，分三组赴各专区检查此项工作，并协助各县进行推广。截至目前为止，该省各地抽调下乡推广的干部已达一百七十多名。各县除在春节时结合文娱活动作了广泛宣传外，并召开了县、区各界人民代表会、扩大干部会、团代会、妇代会等会议，讲解浸种、拌种的好处，传授了技术，并作了实地试验，大大鼓舞了增产信心。代表们都表示：“摸着诀窍了，一定好好宣传，教大家都来浸。”各县代表回村后，即和干部，党员、团员积极带头，向群众推广，进行试验，以实例打破了群众中存在着的迷信、保守、观望等思想。如赤城县在人民代表、党员、干部带头下，已有一百四十五个村庄试验浸种成功。该县小庄子人民代表王悦（村中共支书）动员群众说：“浸种可不难，只要掌握住时间和度数就行。”一经试验，即出了芽，影响了全村家家都准备浸。为了培养大批技术人员，进行推广工作，各县还举办了干部训练班，仅雁北十一县及宣化县的干部训练班，就教会了一万二千多人；万全、阳原达到每村有一个至三个技术推广员，保证了推广工作的顺利进行。另外，为了解决浸种、拌种所需之药械问题，该省自购及中央人民政府农业部配售了一百八十打温度计（温汤浸种用的），每个区掌握四至七支。拌种用的酒精，亦购妥二十七万斤，可供一百五十万亩土地之需要，全部供给察北。雁北、察北也都自行准备了一部好酒，省府已做好拌种器八十五架，分配各专区。为了便于群众学习浸种、拌种方法，正在印发推广画刊一万五千册。目前该省浸种、拌种工作又已推广到户，并获得了一些成绩。如宣化县每村平均已有十分之二的群众学会了技术，涿鹿城区已种六千三百亩的麦子中，有五千三百九十亩的种籽浸了种。但还存在着不少缺点，如延庆县各界代表会上，进行浸种实验时，由于主持试验的人没有注意保存种籽，结果没有出芽，使代表们的思想顾虑没有解除，浸种工作未能普遍开展。张北馒头营区干部陈华学了技术不传达，领导上也不加过问。涿鹿太府村村长不去耐心宣传试验，而在村头监视，谁种麦不浸种就不让去种，有的偷种了，村长便强令其打锣游街，向群众坦白认错。龙关下仓区区干部范春宝，由于自己没学会技术，眼看着群众种麦不浸种，也没办法。更有害的是瞎传授，如涿鹿县大西庄村支书梁盛英，领导三户浸种的七亩半麦子，由于只用热水泡了泡，结果都没有出芽。从以上几个例子，可以看出有些县的区、村领导干部，对推广浸种工作不是严肃负责的态度，而是采取自己不切实学技术，强迫命令的官僚主义的办法。事实证明这种作法是不能把工作作好的。特别是要建立一种新的科学习惯时，更应深入耐心反复宣传，并用实例教育群众，才能使群众体会到它的好处而行动起来。（国勋）
