Implement the Principle of "Less is More"
	Wuhan University Law Department Reforms Curriculum
	Students' Enthusiasm for Learning Unprecedentedly High
[Reported by this newspaper] The Law Department of Wuhan University has further reformed its curriculum, which has improved the students' enthusiasm for learning. Before liberation, the curriculum of the Law Department was entirely arranged according to the Kuomintang reactionaries' "Six Codes," which was not only full of content that maintained the interests of the reactionary ruling class and was anti-people, but also voluminous and complex, making students feel very distressed when studying. After liberation, the department's curriculum underwent preliminary reforms, and group teaching was conducted, but the content of the curriculum still had a "new wine in old bottles" situation, and the students' enthusiasm for learning was still very low.

After the political studies in the previous semester, the ideological understanding of teachers and students has been improved a step further. Coupled with the experience gained in the past six months, the department decided to further reform the curriculum when summarizing the work of the previous semester. Through long-term brewing and repeated discussions between teachers and students, listening to opinions from all parties, and absorbing experiences from all parties, the curriculum reform in this semester of the department implemented the principle of "less is more," and integrated professional learning with political learning. Most of the previous courses were suspended, and efforts were concentrated on adding two new courses—Marxist-Leninist Legal Theory and Policies and Laws—which were listed as compulsory and key courses in the department. Most of the time is spent on studying these two courses, with twelve hours of class per week. It was also decided that the first six weeks would be devoted to studying Marxist-Leninist legal theory, divided into three units: social outlook, national outlook, and legal outlook; followed by the study of policies and laws, divided into four units: political system and new judicial system, land policies and laws, labor policies and laws, and marriage policies and laws. At the same time, the teaching methods have also changed accordingly, with collective teaching and collective learning being implemented. Teachers and students from the entire department also elected representatives to form a learning committee to lead the learning. Each class organized learning groups to conduct mutual assistance learning. Teachers participated in the discussions of each group separately, so that teachers and students were integrated. A summary was conducted after each unit of study.

In order to learn better after the curriculum reform, all teachers and students in the department held a learning mobilization meeting. At the meeting, teachers and students expressed full confidence in the reform of the curriculum, and each group also guaranteed to strengthen unity and mutual assistance to complete the learning tasks.

Now, the teaching of the department is proceeding according to the new plan, and the students are very busy and happy. Each collective self-study and discussion can solve some problems, and the students' enthusiasm for learning has been unprecedentedly improved. (Bai Zhang, Wuhan University)

　　贯彻少而精的原则
    武大法律系改革课程
    同学们学习情绪空前提高
    【本报讯】武汉大学法律系进一步改革课程，提高了同学们的学习情绪。解放前法律系的课程，完全是按照国民党反动派的“六法全书”安排的，不独充满了维护反动的统治阶级利益与反人民的内容，而且量多质杂，同学们学习时感到十分苦闷。解放以后，该系课程曾作初步改革，进行了分组教学，但课程内容仍有换汤不换药的情况，同学们学习情绪仍很低落。
    经过上学期的政治学习，教师与同学的思想认识都提高了一步，加上半年中摸索的经验，该系在上学期总结工作时，便决定进一步改革课程。通过师生的长久酝酿，反复讨论，听取了各方面的意见，吸收了各方面的经验，该系本期的课程改革贯彻了少而精的原则，并且将业务学习与政治学习溶成一片。停开了过去的大部分课程，集中力量增开了两门新课——马列主义的法律理论和政策法令，列为本系的必修和重点课程。将大部分时间放在这两门课的学习上，每周上课十二小时。并决定前六周学习马列主义法律理论，分为社会观、国家观、法律观三个单元进行；接着学习政策法令，分为政权制度及新司法制度，土地政策法令，劳工政策法令，婚姻政策法令等四个单元。同时教学方法也随着有了改变，实行集体教学和集体学习。全系师生并选出代表组成学习委员会来领导学习。各班均组织学习小组进行互助学习。各小组举行讨论时，均有教师分别参加，使师生打成一片。学习中每一单元结束后，均进行总结。
    为了使课程改革后能学习得更好，该系全体师生曾举行学习动员大会。会上，教师、学生均对改革课程充满信心，各小组亦保证以加强团结互助来完成学习任务。
    现在，该系的教学正按新的计划进行，同学们都非常紧张愉快。每次集体自学和讨论中，都能解决一些问题，同学们的学习情绪空前地提高了。（武汉大学白章）
