　　【Xinhua News Agency, Petrozavodsk, 1st】TASS, Petrozavodsk dispatch: March 31st marks the fourth anniversary of the Karelia Autonomous Republic's change to the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.
　　Before the revolution, Karelia was a backward and remote region of Tsarist Russia. At that time, Karelia had no industry, agriculture was very primitive, and the vast majority of residents were illiterate.
　　Now, the republic has built dozens of large manufacturing plants and factories, including the large Kondopoga paper mill and the Segezha pulp and paper mill, the largest in Europe. New towns and residential areas have been built. In agriculture, the sown area has been expanded, and many collective farms have harvested fifteen to twenty centners (one centner equals two hundred catties) of grain per hectare. Horticulture and beekeeping are developing. Dozens of power stations have been built.
　　The timber industry has developed into a huge mechanized sector of the national economy. Power stations, as well as timber handling and loading machines, have been put into operation in the forests. Electric saws have been used on a large scale. The paper industry has exceeded the pre-war production level. Highways and narrow-gauge railways have been built. The republic is able to manufacture prefabricated houses, furniture, internal combustion engines, canned food, cloth, and woven goods. The republic has implemented a seven-year compulsory education system, and many secondary schools, higher education institutions, scientific institutions, and theaters have been established. Literature and art are also developing. The Karelo-Finnish branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has been established.

　　卡累利阿—芬兰共和国巨大的建设成就
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社彼得罗萨佛得斯克讯：三月三十一日是卡累利阿自治共和国改为卡累利阿——芬兰加盟共和国的四周年纪念。
    革命前，卡累利阿是沙俄的一个落后的边远地区。那时，卡累利阿没有工业，农业是很原始，绝大多数居民都是文盲。
    现在，该共和国已建立了几十个大制造厂和工厂，其中有康多波加的大型造纸厂、塞格日的欧洲最大的纤维素与造纸厂。新的城镇和住宅区都兴建起来了。在农业方面，播种面积已经扩大，许多集体农场每公顷收获了十五至二十生丁纳（一生丁纳合二百市斤）的谷物。园艺和养蜂都在发展着。数十个动力站已经建立起来。
    木材工业已经发展成为国民经济中一个巨大的机械化部门。动力站以及木材搬运机与装载机，已在森林内开动。电锯已被大规模地使用。造纸工业已超过了战前的生产水平。公路和窄轨铁路已经修筑起来。共和国已能制造活动房屋、家具、内燃机、罐头食品、布及编织品等。共和国实行了七年制强迫教育，又开办了许多中等学校、高等教育机关、科学机关和剧院。文学艺术也在发展着。苏联科学院卡累利阿——芬兰分院业已成立。
