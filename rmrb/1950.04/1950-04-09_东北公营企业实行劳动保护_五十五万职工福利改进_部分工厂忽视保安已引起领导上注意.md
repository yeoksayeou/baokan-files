　　Northeast Public Enterprises Implement Labor Protection
    Welfare Improved for 550,000 Workers
    Leadership Attention Drawn to Security Neglect in Some Factories
    [This Newspaper News] Special Correspondent Zeng Fuliu reports: Since the Northeast region officially implemented the labor protection system for state-owned and public enterprises in April of last year, significant achievements have been made over the past year. The number of employees covered by labor insurance has reached more than 550,000, accounting for over 90% of the total number of employees in state-owned and public enterprises in the Northeast. 1.5 million dependent relatives of employees have been guaranteed labor protection. The establishment of collective labor protection undertakings is being promoted. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions directly manages two clinics and two hot spring sanatoriums and one worker's hospital. Enterprises have established a total of 22 nurseries, 6 homes for the elderly and disabled, 2 orphanages, 4 sanatoriums, and 2 after-work sanatoriums. Medical equipment is constantly increasing and improving. According to statistics, the region has 40 workers' hospitals and 220 clinics, with 3,923 medical personnel working in these institutions. As of November of last year, the total labor protection fund legally concentrated in the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions was 7,666,366 points (according to the Northeast wage calculation unit). Expenditures on disability and death benefits due to work-related injuries, sickness and disability relief funds, family death allowances, on-the-job and retirement pension allowances, childbirth allowances, and collective undertaking expenses totaled 5,238,282 points. The total expenditure was 41.36% of the income. The remaining accumulated total fund will continue to be used for the establishment of various collective welfare undertakings.
    According to the labor insurance regulations promulgated by the Northeast People's Government, some expenses are directly paid by enterprise administrations, such as medical expenses, wages during the period of medical treatment for work-related illnesses and injuries and the maternity period for female employees, funeral expenses for work-related deaths, wage subsidies during the period of medical treatment for non-work-related injuries, and the operating expenses and equipment costs of hospitals and nurseries. This part of the expenditure is relatively large, and the number of people who benefit is also relatively large. In heavy industry, general expenditure is 8% to 9% of the total wage bill. In light industry, it is generally 4% to 5% of the total wage bill. Taking the Benxi Coal and Iron Company as an example, from January to October of last year, the above-mentioned expenses accounted for 9.19% of the total wage bill.
            Saving Expenses and Increasing Production
    The widespread implementation of labor insurance in Northeast state-owned and public enterprises has made workers more determined to support the People's Government and the Communist Party and has strengthened the concept of being masters of the country, dispelling the ideas of technological conservatism, "raising children to guard against old age," and "relying on heaven for protection" that have been left to the workers by history. Consequently, enterprises have overcome the phenomenon of some employees hopping between factories, and apprenticeship competitions have been launched spontaneously in railways and some mines. There has also been a significant increase in production. Workers at the Harbin Chicken and Duck Company have automatically found ways to save expenses for the factory in many ways. The output of the soap department of Harbin Industrial Company has increased by 50%, and the output of the oil pan department has increased by one-third. Female workers have reflected: "In the past, children were raised in the machine room, and we still lost our jobs. Now the factory is so good to us, we would be letting the factory down if we didn't work hard."
    The implementation of labor protection work is a deep-going publicity and education effort and also a complex and meticulous organizational work. Railway and mining units have made great use of various forms in their publicity work, such as organizing training classes, lectures, symposiums, respect-for-the-elderly meetings, family symposiums, songs, and dramas, so that workers have further recognized the power of class unity, recognized the importance of consolidating the trade union and consolidating the people's regime, and strengthened the view of actively producing to support the war. Organizationally, labor protection committees have been established at all levels, and all parties work closely together from top to bottom to preside over and implement the work. Labor protection cadres are also set up in trade union groups to carry out daily work. The various regulations and procedures for labor protection work are very complex, which requires striving for unity and brevity. Registration work is the most important link in determining whether labor protection is implemented accurately. Without the self-consciousness of the masses and the resulting mutual supervision of the masses, the registration of hundreds of thousands of employees and their dependent relatives cannot be completed accurately and quickly.
            Preventing Diseases and Injuries is More Important Than Post-Event Relief
    The main experience in implementing labor protection work in Northeast China over the past year is that labor insurance must be combined with strengthening work safety and health in factories and mines. To protect the health of employees to facilitate production, it is not only about relief and compensation after illness or disability, but more importantly, about preventing and reducing the occurrence of illness and disability.
    The Hegang Coal Mine is a Northeast coal mine where work safety has been somewhat successful. The mine has basically changed the passive state of being busy dealing with water, fire, wind, and gas in the past and has turned to actively finding ways to improve working conditions and improve water prevention, fire prevention, ventilation, and other equipment. In the ten months of 1949, the average number of injuries per 10,000 tons of coal was reduced by 45% compared with the same period in 1948, and accidents were reduced by 80%. After inspecting safety equipment and rewarding those who did well and criticizing those who did poorly, the mine established a work responsibility system, assigned safety personnel to work at the pit entrances, and clearly defined the responsibilities of the personnel. In the campaign to create new production records, a new record campaign was launched to eliminate accidents and reduce casualties, creating safety facilities such as water wind turbines, rock dust boron, safety gates, sprinkler pipes, safety hooks, and personnel vehicles. In September of last year, the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions issued a decision on establishing a labor protection supervision system, promulgated the work regulations for labor protection supervisors, and stipulated that labor protection officers and cadres should be set up from the Federation of Trade Unions to trade union groups. A series of inspection methods were also clearly stipulated for the safety and health equipment, collective welfare undertakings, and strict adherence to working hours and rest days of stations, sections, and factories. The Party Committee and administration of the railway also issued instructions at the same time to closely cooperate. Subsequently, a safety campaign month was launched throughout the railway, which has initially achieved results. For example, in the month before the safety campaign month at the Mudanjiang Railway Factory, work-related injuries accounted for 6.4% of the factory's employees, and illnesses accounted for 48.8%. After the safety campaign month in September, work-related injuries decreased by 76.3% compared with the previous month, illnesses decreased by 27.4%, and medical expenditure decreased by more than 46%. As a result, the factory's production task of repairing 14 vehicles was completed on time, and the vehicle production plan exceeded 110%. This powerfully illustrates that labor protection has an important positive significance for improving production and increasing national wealth. In other industries and cities, the implementation of such safety and health improvements has also received more or less effect. For example, the trade union of Anshan Iron and Steel Company led workers to improve 23 safety equipment. A military industrial company organized a technical inspection team by the trade union administrative and technical departments and also improved dozens of safety equipment. In the six months before the promulgation of the Mechanical Safety Law in Harbin, there were 14 workers who were injured or disabled due to work-related causes. However, in the four months after the promulgation of the law, there were only two minor injuries in the city.
            Establishing a Labor Supervision System to Organize Accident Inspections
    However, the above situation is still a very small part of the preliminary improvements in the entire Northeast region, and there are still many shortcomings in work safety and health. The colonial and slave-like forced labor of Japanese imperialism in Northeast China meant that the safety and health equipment in factories and mines was very poor. In addition, the destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army formed the main difficulty in improving working conditions in factories and mines. In some enterprises, the leading cadres of the administration and trade unions generally do not pay enough attention to this undertaking, which is directly related to production. The administration only pays attention to completing production tasks and ignores the safety equipment necessary for production. The trade union lacks initiative and proactiveness and focuses on passive and simple relief. The health department also focuses on simple treatment and lacks preventive views and active collaborative measures. It has not solved the necessary equipment as much as possible. 70% of the machines in Harbin Railway Factory do not have safety equipment. Song Weiming, a blacksmith at the Harbin Locomotive Depot, was injured because he did not have gloves. However, adding up his wages and production losses could buy 850 pairs of gloves. This lack of labor protection policy thinking is another important obstacle to improving work safety and health in factories and mines. The formulation and implementation of labor protection regulations and systems are also very weak. Because of the lack of safety and health education for workers, coupled with the fact that workers do not abide by labor discipline and lack technical knowledge, many accidents have occurred. In addition, failing to improve labor organization, improve operations, and strengthen planning in production, but only working overtime to increase production, greatly affects the health of workers and the sustainability of production. In general, government labor departments have not yet established an inspection system and an accident and injury reporting system, and have not fulfilled their responsibility to improve work safety and health equipment in factories and mines. Due to the existence of these reasons, the situation of work safety and health in Northeast factories and mines needs to be improved urgently, and accidents are constantly occurring. From April to September of last year, the Xian Coal Mine lost 2,298 workdays due to sick leave. If the productivity of each worker is calculated at 0.4 tons, then 919 tons of coal were underproduced.
    The relevant departments of the Northeast Industry Department, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Coal Mine Federation of Trade Unions, the Labor General Bureau, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly organized an accident inspection committee, which has conducted inspections of the Benxi and Fushun mines. The Northeast People's Government has made a decision on establishing a labor supervision system, and the relevant departments have begun to implement the work regulations for labor supervisors.

　　东北公营企业实行劳动保护
    五十五万职工福利改进 
    部分工厂忽视保安已引起领导上注意
    【本报讯】特约记者曾伏流报道：东北区自去年四月正式实行国营公营企业劳动保护制度，经过一年的时间，已获得显著成绩。实行劳动保险的职工，已达五十五万余人，占东北国营公营企业职工总数百分之九十强。职工直系供养亲属有一百五十万人获得劳动保护的保障。集体劳动保护事业的创设正在推行，由东北总工会直接管理的已有医疗所二处，温泉疗养所二处，工人医院一处。由各企业创办的托儿所共二十二处，养老残废院六处，孤儿保育院二处，疗养所四处，业余疗养所二处。至于医疗设备则尤在不断的增长与改进中，据统计全区已设四十个工人医院，二百二十个医务所，在上述院所工作的医务人员，数达三千九百二十三人。截止去年十一月份，各企业依法集中于东北总工会的劳动保护总基金为七百六十六万六千三百六十六分（按照东北工资之计算单位），因公残废及死亡抚恤金，疾病及残废救济金，亲属死亡补助金，在职及退职养老补助金，生育儿女补助金，集体事业费等，共支出五百二十三万八千二百八十二分。支出总额为收入的百分之四一·三六。其余积累着的总基金，亦将继续用于各种集体福利事业的创设。
    根据东北人民政府所颁布的劳动保险条例中，有些费用是由企业行政直接支付的——如医疗费、因公病伤医疗期间及女职工生育期间的工资、因公死亡丧葬费、非因公伤医疗期间的工资补助金、医院及托儿所之经常费与备品费等。而这一部分的开支数目比较大，享受的人数也较多。重工业方面一般开支为工资总额的百分之八到九。轻工业方面一般为工资总额的百分之四到五。以本溪煤铁公司为例，自去年一月至十月份，上述各项开支即占工资总数的百分之九·一九。
            节省了开支提高了产量
    东北国营公营企业普遍推行劳动保险后，使工人更加坚决拥护人民政府和共产党，更加强了国家主人翁的观念，打消了历史上遗留给工人的技术保守，“养儿防老”、“靠天保佑”的思想，随之各企业单位克服了部分职工的跳厂现象，在铁路和有些矿山都自动的展开了带徒弟竞赛。在生产上也有了显著的提高。哈市鸡鸭公司工人自动的多方面设法为工厂节省开支。哈市实业公司肥皂部产量提高了百分之五十，油锅部产量提高三分之一。女工们则纷纷反映：“过去孩子养在机器房，还得失业，现在工厂对咱们这样好，不好好干，就对不起工厂。”
    劳动保护工作的实施是一个深入的宣传教育工作，也是一个复杂细致的组织工作。铁路矿山等单位在宣传工作中利用了各种形式作用很大。如组织训练班、讲演、座谈会、敬老大会、家属座谈会、歌、剧等，使工人进一步认识了阶级团结的力量，认清了巩固工会，巩固人民政权的重要性，加强了积极生产支援战争的观点。在组织上则建立了各级劳保委员会，从上到下各方密切配合，主持与贯彻工作的进行。在工会小组内并设立劳保干部，以执行日常工作。劳动保护工作的各种规章，手续制度是很庞杂的，这需要力求统一与简要。登记工作是劳动保护实施准确与否的最主要环节，几十万职工及其直系供养亲属的登记，没有群众的自觉及由此而来的群众的互相监督，是不能准确迅速完成的。
            平时预防疾病残伤比事后救济更重要
    一年来东北执行劳动保护工作的主要经验，就是劳动保险必须和加强工矿安全卫生工作相结合。要保护职工的健康，以利生产，就不仅是在其疾病伤残之后的救济与抚恤，更重要的是预防和减少疾病伤残的发生。
    鹤岗煤矿是东北八大煤矿保安工作略有成效的企业单位，该矿基本上已改变了过去忙于处理水、火、风、瓦斯的被动状态，而转入积极的设法改善劳动条件，改善防水、防火、通风等设备。在一九四九年十个月内较一九四八年同一时期平均每万吨煤负伤者已减少百分之四十五，事故减少百分之八十。该矿经过检查安全设备，并奖励了做的好的和批评了做的不好的以后，又确立了工作负责制，把安全工作人员分配到坑口上班，明确划分了该项人员的职责。在创造生产新纪录运动中，同时发起了消灭事故减少伤亡的新纪录运动，创造了如水风机、岩粉硼、安全闸、洒水管、安全钩、人车等安全设施。东北铁路总工会在去年九月发布了关于建立劳动保护监察制度的决定，公布了劳动保护监察员工作条例，规定了从总工会到工会小组，都设劳动保护员与干事，并明确的规定了一系列的对站、段、厂的安全与卫生设备、集体福利事业、严守劳动时间与休息日等等的检查办法。该路党委与行政亦同时发出指示，密切配合。继又在全路开展安全运动月，亦已初步收到效果。如牡丹江铁路工厂在安全运动月前一月中，公伤员工为全厂员工的百分之六点四，疾病为百分之四十八点八。在九月的安全运动月后，公伤员工较前减低百分之七十六点三，疾病降低百分之二十七点四，医疗支出减少百分之四十六强。因而该厂修车十四辆的生产任务得以按时完成，车辆生产计划并超过百分之一百一十。这有力的说明了劳动保护，对提高生产与增加国家财富，是有其重要的积极意义。在其他产业及城市中，这种安全卫生改进的实施，亦收到或多或少的效果。如鞍山钢铁公司总工会领导工人曾改进了二十三处的安全设备。军工某公司，由工会行政及技术部门组织了技术检查组，亦改进了数十种安全设备。哈尔滨市在机械安全法令颁布前的六个月内，因公伤残的工人有十四名，但该法令颁布后的四个月中，全市有二人轻伤。
            建立劳动监察制组织对事故检查
    但上述情况，在全东北范围尚是极少部分的初步改进，安全卫生工作中存在的缺点还是极多的。日本帝国主义在东北殖民地奴隶式的强迫劳动，工矿安全卫生的设备是很恶劣的，加之国民党匪军的破坏，形成了改善工矿劳动条件中的主要困难。在某些企业行政与工会的领导干部，一般的对这项直接与生产有关的事业重视还很不够，行政上只注意完成生产任务，而忽略生产所必需的安全设备；工会则缺乏主动与积极性，偏重于消极的单纯救济；卫生部门也偏重了单纯治疗，缺乏预防观点和积极的协同措施；没有尽可能的解决必要的设备。哈尔滨市铁路工厂百分之七十的机器是没有安全设备的。哈尔滨市机务段大锤工宋维明因为没有手套设备而负伤，但是把本人工资和生产上的损失两项加起来，即可买八百五十双手套。这种劳动保护政策思想的缺乏，便是工矿安全卫生改进上的另一重要障碍。劳动保护规程和制度的制订和执行，也是非常不力的。因为缺乏对工人的安全卫生教育工作，加之工人不遵守劳动纪律，缺乏技术知识而发生的事故也不少。此外，不善于改进劳动组织，改进操作，加强生产中的计划性，只是加班加点来提高生产，就大大影响了工人的身体健康和生产中的持续力。政府劳动部门一般的尚没有建立检查制度及事故伤亡的报告制度，没有尽到改进工矿安全卫生设备的责任。由于这些原因的存在，东北工矿安全卫生的情况是需要急待改善，事故已在不断发生。西安煤矿去年四月至九月的六个月内，因病假误工即达二千二百九十八个，如果每个工的生产率以零点四吨计算，则少产煤九百一十九吨。
    现东北工业部，东北总工会，东北煤矿总工会，劳动总局，公安部等有关部门，已共同组织了事故检查委员会，已进行了对本溪、抚顺两矿的检查。东北人民政府做出了关于建立劳动监察制度的决定，劳动监察员工作条例，有关部门已开始执行。
