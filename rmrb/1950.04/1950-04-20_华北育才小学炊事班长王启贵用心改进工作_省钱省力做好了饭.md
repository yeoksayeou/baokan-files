Huabei Yucai Primary School Kitchen Staff Head Wang Qigui Improves Work with Dedication
Saving Money and Effort to Make Good Meals

[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Qigui, head of the kitchen staff of Huabei Yucai Primary School, studied and improved his work, saving a significant amount of manpower and construction costs. The school will reward him. After Huabei Yucai Primary School moved to Beijing last year, it initially had only over 600 students, while the kitchen employed 28 cooks and 2 administrators. In November of last year, Wang Qigui, the head of the kitchen staff, responded to the superior's call to change the way of working in rural areas and practice strict economy. He carefully studied the work in the kitchen. Yucai Primary School originally had two large kitchens, burning eight stoves. Each kitchen cooked rice and dishes at the same time, which made it difficult to allocate manpower and wasted coal. Therefore, he suggested changing to one kitchen specializing in cooking rice and one kitchen specializing in cooking dishes, which could reduce the number of stoves burned by four, saving one administrator and eight cooks. At that time, some administrators and cooks did not agree with his opinion, believing that the number of students had increased and the number of stoves and personnel could not be reduced.

However, the results of a two-month trial proved that Wang Qigui's opinion was correct. One administrator can completely handle two kitchens. Each kitchen only needs nine cooks to complete the task. Including the two cooks who make meals for the sick and boil water, a total of only twenty people are used. Not only can they make meals for 700 students, but they can also do better than before.

In January of this year, the Ministry of Education decided that Yucai Primary School should increase by 500 students. The school initially planned to build a large kitchen, and the construction company estimated that it would cost more than 86,900 jin of millet. Later, after research by the cadres in charge of food work and Wang Qigui, it was decided not to build a new kitchen, but only to modify the original kitchen and stoves. As a result, only 10,000 jin of millet were used, saving construction costs of more than 76,900 jin of millet. At the same time, only eight more cooks were added, and they can make meals for 1,200 students. In this way, although the number of students has doubled since entering the city, the number of cooks is still the same as before.

In addition, the school's bathhouse used to consume 400 jin of coal every day. Since the winter vacation last year, Zhao Xi was transferred to be in charge of coal burning. He modified the stove and studied the method of sealing the fire. As a result, the average daily coal consumption was only 100 jin, saving 300 jin compared to before.

### 华北育才小学炊事班长王启贵用心改进工作  省钱省力做好了饭

　　华北育才小学炊事班长王启贵用心改进工作
　　省钱省力做好了饭
    【本报讯】华北育才小学炊事班长王启贵，研究改进工作，节省了大量人力和修建费。该校将予以奖励。华北育才小学去年迁至北京后，最初仅有学生六百余人，而伙房用炊事员二十八名，管理员二名。去年十一月，炊事班长王启贵响应上级改变农村工作方式，厉行精简节约的号召，细心研究伙房工作。育才小学原来有两个大厨房，烧八个炉灶，每个伙房同时做饭做菜，人手摆不开，而且浪费煤火。因此他建议改为一个厨房专做饭，一个厨房专做菜，可以少烧四个灶，节省一名管理员和八名炊事员。当时有的管理员和炊事员不赞成他的意见，认为学生增多了，不能减灶减人。
    但试行两个月的结果，证明了王启贵的意见是对的。一个管理员管两个厨房，完全可以胜任。每个伙房只用九名炊事员，也完成了任务。加上做病号饭和烧开水的两名炊事员，一共才用二十人。不独可以做出七百学生的菜饭，而且比过去做的还好。
    今年一月教育部决定育才小学要增加五百学生。该校最初预计要建一所大厨房，建筑公司估价要用小米八万六千九百余斤，后来经领导伙食工作的干部和王启贵研究，决定不建新厨房，只把原来的伙房与炉灶加以修改。结果只用了一万斤小米，节省了七万六千九百余斤小米的修建费。同时，炊事员也只增加了八人，就能作出一千二百名学生的菜饭。这样，学生较入城时虽增加了一倍，而炊事员还和原来一样多。
    又，该校洗澡塘过去每天需用煤四百斤，上年寒假以来，调赵西去担任烧煤工作。他把炉灶加以修改，同时研究封火办法，结果每天平均只烧煤一百斤，比从前节省了三百斤。
