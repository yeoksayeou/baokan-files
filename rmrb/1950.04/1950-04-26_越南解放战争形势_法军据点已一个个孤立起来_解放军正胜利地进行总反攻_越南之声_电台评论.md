Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, April 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, "Voice of Vietnam" radio commented on the military situation in Vietnam during the first quarter of this year, stating: At the beginning of this year, great diplomatic victories and a series of military victories across Vietnam arrived simultaneously.

　　In North Vietnam, French military strongholds along the line from Mong Cai in the east to Lao Cai in the west have been gradually and tightly surrounded by the Vietnamese Liberation Army. Most of the Lao Cai to Ha Giang area has been liberated, and the French troops in Lao Cai city are frantically awaiting reinforcements from the south. However, the French forces are tied down on battle lines throughout Indochina.

　　In South Vietnam, the liberation war is reaching a fever pitch, and the Liberation Army has been able to concentrate a large number of troops to launch strong attacks on the provinces of Can Tho, Tra Vinh, Vinh Long and Bien Hoa. To coordinate with these large-scale offensives, the people of Saigon and Cholon have held demonstrations to protest against the American and French imperialists and their running dogs. All the bunkers in Tra Vinh Province and other areas have been destroyed by the Liberation Army, and the main cities controlled by the French army in South Vietnam are threatened by the Liberation Army day and night. These facts demonstrate why the French command has abandoned its original plan to reinforce North Vietnam from the South.

　　In Central Vietnam, the armed struggle against the French army has also entered a new stage. After eliminating thousands of French troops, the armies in the areas of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien, relying on the full support of the people, have successively isolated French strongholds one by one. Thousands of villagers have successively built obstacles and formed guerrilla teams to besiege French military strongholds.

　　In the third war zone of North Vietnam, the French army has achieved some success in a large-scale operation, with the aim of controlling this reserve of manpower and materials, and compensating for their serious losses in the areas of Hoa Binh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien, the Hanoi-Haiphong highway, and during the Viet Minh's attack on the Ba Me airport south of Hanoi. However, the French army's offensive in the third war zone has not affected the nationwide preparations for the upcoming general counter-offensive. The Liberation Army continues to launch fierce attacks on French military strongholds throughout Vietnam. Moreover, at present, because the Liberation Army in the third war zone is besieging a large number of French troops there with the people through ever-increasing armed struggles, the French forces in other important areas have been exposed to the deadly blows of the Liberation Army.

　　The American military aid to the French army may cause some difficulties for the Vietnamese Liberation Army and the people. However, due to the ongoing general mobilization and the development of the world situation which is favorable to our struggle, all the aggressive conspiracies of the American and French imperialists will eventually be crushed, and the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army and the Vietnamese people will surely win the final victory.

　　越南解放战争形势
    法军据点已一个个孤立起来  解放军正胜利地进行总反攻
    “越南之声”电台评论
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十二日讯：“越南之声”电台评论今年第一季越南的军事形势称：在今年年初，伟大的外交胜利与全越各地一系列的军事胜利同时到来。
    在北越，东自芒街西至老开一线的法军据点，都已逐渐被越南解放军紧密地包围起来。老开至河江地区已大部解放，老开城中的法军正狂乱地等待着南方的增援。但法军都被牵制在印度支那全境各处的战线上。
    在南越，解放战争正极度高涨，解放军已经可能集中大量兵力对芹苴、茶荣、臻滀与边和各省发动强力攻击。为了与这些大规模的攻势配合，西贡与堤岸的人民已举行了示威游行，以抗议美、法帝国主义者及其走狗们。茶荣省和其他区域的所有碉堡，已被解放军破坏，南越法军控制的主要城市，也日夜受到解放军的威胁。这些事实说明了法军统帅部为什么已经放弃了从南方增援北越的原定计划。
    在中越，对法军的武装斗争也进入一个新的阶段。在消灭了数千法军之后，广平、广治、承天这一区域的军队，依靠人民的全力支持，已把法军据点一个一个地相继孤立起来。成千的村民相继建筑障碍物并成立游击队，围困法军据点。
    在北越第三战区，法军在一次大规模的作战上虽曾获得某些成功，其目的，是想控制这个人力和物力的储蓄地，并补偿他们在和平、广平、广治、承天、河内、海防公路各处，以及越军对河内以南巴梅机场攻击时所受的严重损失。但是，法军在第三战区的攻击，绝未影响到全国范围的对于即将到来的总反攻的准备。解放军继续对全越各处的法军据点发动猛烈攻击。而且，在目前，由于第三战区的解放军正与人民以不断增多的武装斗争，把大量法军围困在那里，因而使得其他重要地区的法军，已暴露在解放军的致命打击之下。
    美国将以军事援助交予法军，越南解放军与人民也许还要遭遇一些困难。然而，由于正在进行的总动员，以及有利于我们斗争的世界局势的发展，美、法帝国主义者一切侵略阴谋终将被粉碎，而越南人民解放军与越南人民定将赢得最后的胜利。
