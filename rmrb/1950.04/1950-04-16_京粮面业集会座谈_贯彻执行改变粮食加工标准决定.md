　　Beijing Grain and Flour Industry Holds Symposium
    Implement the Decision to Change Grain Processing Standards
    [This newspaper dispatch] To implement the State Council of the Central People's Government's decision to change grain processing standards, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Commerce, in addition to issuing a notice on the 13th, specially convened more than 80 representatives from machine-milled flour industry, rice and flour industry, and grain depot industry at the preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce at 2 PM on the 14th. The purpose was to communicate the spirit of implementation and registration methods. First, the nutritional value of Standard 81 flour and the importance of saving grain were conveyed. Representatives from all industries unanimously expressed their support and determination to implement the government's call.
    During the exchange of opinions, the representatives raised two questions: (1) What standard should be used for flour production given the different qualities of wheat? (2) How can milling techniques be standardized? After research, it was stipulated that the standard should be 81.01 jin of flour per 100 jin of medium-grade Hebei spring wheat. The flour quality of other wheat should also be based on this standard, and should not be exceeded; lower qualities are not limited. As for manufacturing techniques and methods, information can be obtained from the Processing Section of the Beijing Grain Corporation. Samples of Standard 81 flour "Beijing Universal Flour" and explanatory notes were distributed on the spot for reference by various industries. The meeting adjourned successfully at 4 PM.
                                                  (Ji Tao)

　　京粮面业集会座谈
    贯彻执行改变粮食加工标准决定
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府商业局为执行中央人民政府政务院关于改变粮食加工标准的决定，除于十三日发布通告外，十四日下午二时，特假北京市工商联合会筹备会召集机制面粉业、米面粮业、粮栈业等代表八十余人，传达贯彻执行精神暨登记实行办法。首先传达标准八一面的营养价值暨节约粮食的重要性，各业代表一致表示拥护，并坚决执行政府号召。
    交换意见时，各代表提出两项疑问：（一）小麦品质不同，今后出面应按如何标准，（二）磨制面粉之技术如何划一。经研究后规定可按河北省中等花小麦每百斤出八一点○一斤的面粉为标准，其它小麦出面质量亦按此粉为标准，不许超过，低者不限。至于制造技术与办法，可赴北京市粮食公司加工科了解研究。当场并分发标准八一面“北京通粉”样品暨说明书供各业参考。迄四时圆满散会。
