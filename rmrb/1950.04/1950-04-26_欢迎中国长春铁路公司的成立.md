　　Welcome the Establishment of the China Changchun Railway Company

　　In order to implement the Sino-Soviet agreement on the China Changchun Railway of February 14, 1950, the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments, after negotiations in Beijing this month, jointly decided: To formally establish the China Changchun Railway Company from April 25, 1950, as an institution for the joint management of the railway by China and the Soviet Union before the railway is handed over to China. Both parties also determined, in accordance with the principle of equality, that the leadership positions of the company would be held in rotation by representatives of the Chinese and Soviet sides every other year. The candidates for the leadership of the company for the first year have also been appointed by mutual agreement between the two governments. From now on, the management of the China Changchun Railway enters a new period.

　　The work of restoring and constructing railways in New China has achieved great results in the past short two or three years. One of the important reasons for this achievement is that we have extensively absorbed the advanced experience of Soviet railways and received technical assistance from Soviet experts. The Northeast Railway was the first to absorb the Soviet experience in railway management and operation with the help of Soviet experts from the Changchun Railway, and implemented scientific systems such as unified management, planned transportation, crew responsibility system, new road maintenance method, and station operations. Therefore, the railway industry in Northeast China has developed the fastest. Later, when these experiences were推广 (tuī guǎng - popularized) to the interior, the railway landscape in the interior was also renewed. These facts prove that the advanced experience of Soviet railways has been effective in the Chinese people's railway industry. However, it should be pointed out that our learning and application of the advanced experience of Soviet railways is still relatively piecemeal and not systematic enough. This is a major shortcoming. In order to further advance the railway cause of New China, it is necessary to more systematically master the advanced experience of Soviet railways. The establishment of the China Changchun Railway Company provides a good opportunity for our railway workers to study in depth. We must regard the China Changchun Railway Company as a good cadre school and the Soviet experts as our teachers, and learn from them with an open mind. According to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet agreement on the Changchun Railway, the time for the transfer of the Changchun Railway to China is no later than the end of 1952. By that time, we will have a group of railway technical talents trained by the China Changchun Railway Company cadre school who have systematically mastered the advanced Soviet experience, and we will be more confident in managing it as well as it was during the Sino-Soviet joint management after taking over the Changchun Railway, and further build other Chinese railways as well as the Changchun Railway.

　　For the development of Sino-Soviet equal, friendly, and mutually beneficial relations, and for the advancement of the Chinese people's railway construction cause, let us celebrate the establishment of the China Changchun Railway Company! Celebrate the smooth completion of the glorious tasks entrusted to it by the Chinese and Soviet governments by all the Chinese and Soviet personnel of the China Changchun Railway Company!

　　欢迎中国长春铁路公司的成立
    为了实施一九五零年二月十四日中苏关于中长春铁路的协定，中苏两国政府代表已于本月间在北京经谈判后共同议定：自一九五零年四月二十五日起，正式成立中国长春铁路公司，作为中苏两国在该路移交中国前共同管理该路的机构。双方并按照平等原则，确定了该公司的领导职务每隔一年由中苏双方代表轮换担任。该公司第一年的领导人选也已由双方政府相互同意任命。从此，中国长春铁路的管理进入了一个新的时期。
    新中国的铁路恢复与建设工作，在过去短短的两三年内已获得很大成绩。获得这一成绩的重要原因之一，就是因我们广泛吸取了苏联铁路的先进经验，并得到了苏联专家的技术援助。东北铁路最先在长春铁路苏联专家的帮助下吸取了苏联在铁路管理和经营方面的经验，实行了统一管理、计划运输、乘务负责制、新养路法、车站作业等科学制度，因此东北的铁路事业发展得最快。以后这些经验推广到关内，又使关内的铁路面貌为之一新。这些事实证明，苏联铁路的先进经验在中国人民铁路事业中已行之有效。但是应该指出，我们对于苏联铁路先进经验的学习和运用，还是比较零碎的，不够系统化的。这是一个重大缺点。为了把新中国的铁路事业更向前推进一步，就必须更系统地掌握苏联铁路的先进经验。中国长春铁路公司的成立，正是给了我国的铁路工作人员一个深入学习的好机会。我们必须把中国长春铁路公司当作一个良好的干部学校，把苏联专家当作我们的教师，虚心地向他们学习。按照中苏关于长春铁路的协定的规定，长春铁路移交给中国的时间不迟于一九五二年末，到那时我们有了一批经过中国长春铁路公司这个干部学校训练出来的有系统地掌握了苏联先进经验的铁路技术人材，我们就可以更有把握地在接管长春铁路以后把它管理得像在中苏共管时一样好，并进而把中国其他铁路建设得也像长春铁路一样好。
    为了中苏平等友好互助关系的展开，为了中国人民铁路建设事业的前进，让我们庆祝中国长春铁路公司的成立！庆祝中国长春铁路公司的中苏全体人员顺利地完成中苏两国政府所给予它的光荣任务！
