Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 14th: Yinji District in Linxia, Gansu, earnestly implements ethnic policies, establishes a joint democratic government of all ethnic groups, and resolves Hui-Han ethnic disputes. In this area, Han people account for 60% of the population, and Hui people account for 40%. After the area was liberated in August of last year, remnants of the Ma bandits, under the guise of the "People's Salvation Army," engaged in robbery and murder, causing Han people to flee to areas such as Xiahe and Tufang. At that time, it was the autumn harvest season, and some Hui people took the opportunity to harvest the crops of the Han people. In addition, bandits and special agents spread rumors and sowed discord, and the local people's government also had shortcomings in implementing ethnic policies, which led to ethnic disputes and mutual killings. To address this, the Gansu Provincial People's Government, in coordination with cadres from the sub-district, county, and district-level people's governments, formed a work team and went deep into various areas to assist in establishing grassroots government organizations. First, a mass meeting of the entire district was convened, and township heads and village directors were elected based on ethnic unity. During the elections, Hui people elected Han people, and Han people elected Hui people, electing working cadres who truly served the Hui and Han people. They worked day and night, vigorously promoting the importance of Hui-Han unity, promptly resolving various disputes, and calling on Hui and Han people to mutually ensure unity and cooperation. In the four townships (three, four, five, and six) where ethnic disputes were more severe, a Solidarity and Mutual Assistance Committee was specifically established, a unity conference was held, a pact of solidarity and mutual assistance was drawn up, and Hui and Han people were mobilized to comfort and provide relief to the families of victims. As a result, both Hui and Han sides gradually dispelled hostile feelings, and all Han and Hui residents who had fled to the surrounding villages returned. Each township also organized a disaster relief committee. In addition to the 30 metric tons of relief grain allocated to the district by the People's Government, villages also launched mutual assistance and mutual lending activities, and started a production campaign.

　　甘肃临夏尹集区
    建立各族联合民主政权
    解除回汉民族纠纷加强团结
    【新华社西安十四日电】甘肃临夏尹集区认真执行民族政策，建立各族人民联合的民主政权，解除了回、汉民族纠纷。该地汉民占百分之六十，回民占百分之四十。去年八月该地解放后，马匪潜伏残部曾以“救民军”为幌子，一度在该区抢劫烧杀，汉民相率逃至夏河、土房等地。当时正值秋收，部分回民趁机收割了汉民庄稼，加上土匪特务从中造谣挑拨，当地人民政府在执行民族政策时也存在缺点，因而酿成了民族纠纷，相互仇杀。为此，甘肃省人民政府特配合分区、县和区乡人民政府干部组成工作组，深入各地工作，协助建立基层政权组织，首先召开全区群众大会，在民族团结的基础上，选出各乡乡长、村主任。选举中，回民选汉民，汉民选回民，选出了真正为回汉人民服务的工作干部。他们日夜奔走，大力宣传回汉团结的重要性，及时解决了各种纠纷，并号召回汉人民互相保障团结和合作。在民族纠纷较严重的三、四、五、六四个乡，特别成立了团结互助委员会，召开了团结大会，订立了团结互助公约，并发动回汉人民安抚和救济受难家属，因而回汉双方逐渐解除了仇视心理，逃至四乡的汉、回居民全部回庄。各乡并组织了救灾委员会，除人民政府拨发给该区救济粮三百公担外，各村还发动互助互借，展开了生产运动。
