Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch. TASS dispatch from Tokyo, 1st: The Akahata newspaper reported: When Syngman Rhee visited Japan in mid-February, he concluded a secret agreement with Yoshida. According to the agreement, Japan will transport war materials to South Korea. The method of transportation in the treaty has been negotiated by the former South Korean puppet government's Army Chief of Staff, Tsai Bing-te, who recently visited Japan. The newspaper stated that Syngman Rhee and Yoshida may have reached an agreement on cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek, with the aim of making South Korea a base for Japanese pilots to bomb cities in Northeast China and North Korea. The English version of the Mainichi Shimbun, Seoul, March 29th, reported: Tsai Bing-te made a statement explaining that the South Korean puppet government, the Japanese government, and MacArthur's staff are negotiating to forcibly deport Koreans in Japan to South Korea. Korean人士 in Tokyo pointed out that 250,000 to 300,000 Koreans residing in Japan will be sent to South Korea, most of whom are unemployed and pro-democracy elements, including leaders of Korean pro-democracy groups. In South Korea, the Syngman Rhee group will deal with them decisively. MacArthur's staff has taken an active role in preparing to forcibly deport Koreans from Japan to South Korea. The Akahata newspaper also pointed out that the work of deporting Koreans from Japan has already begun.
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd dispatch: US imperialism is stepping up its crimes of arming the Syngman Rhee puppet clique to slaughter the Korean people. Under the direct command of the US military "advisory" group, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has decided to establish 120 "military training centers" in major cities in South Korea, attempting to drive 200,000 South Korean youths to receive American-style military training, to serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee puppet government to "suppress" people's guerrillas and provoke civil war.
The South Korean pseudo-"National Assembly" announced on March 30th the "official approval" to allow the US military "advisory" group to operate openly in South Korea, and to accept US military "aid" aimed at ruling South Korea.

　　美日朝反动派签秘密协定
    日本军火将运南朝鲜     
    图使南朝鲜成为轰炸中国和北朝鲜各城市的基地
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社一日电引东京消息：赤旗报报道：李承晚于二月中旬访问日本时，曾与吉田订立一秘密协定。根据该协定，日本将输送战争物资予南朝鲜。条约中的运送办法，已由新近访问日本的前南朝鲜傀儡政府陆军参谋长蔡秉德负责谈判。该报称：李承晚与吉田可能已在与蒋介石合作的问题上取得协议，其目的，在于使南朝鲜成为由日本飞行员驾驶的飞机轰炸中国东北与北朝鲜各城市的基地。每日新闻英文版汉城三月二十九日消息：蔡秉德曾发表谈话，这一谈话说明南朝鲜傀儡政府方面和日本政府及麦克阿瑟参谋部方面，正在进行谈判，要强迫驱逐在日本的朝鲜人到南朝鲜去。在东京的朝鲜人士指出，二十五万到三十万的旅日朝鲜人，将被送到南朝鲜去，他们大部是失业者及民主分子，其中包括朝鲜的民主团体领袖。在南朝鲜，李承晚集团将断然处置他们。麦克阿瑟的参谋部在准备自日本强行驱逐朝鲜人到南朝鲜去的工作中，担负了积极的任务。赤旗报并指出：自日本驱逐朝鲜人的工作业已开始。
    【新华社平壤二日电】美帝国主义现正加紧进行其武装李承晚傀儡集团以屠杀朝鲜人民的罪行。李承晚傀儡政府在美国军事“顾问”团的直接指挥下，已决定在南朝鲜各大城市设立一百二十处“军事训练所”，企图驱使二十万南朝鲜青年受美国式的军事训练，以充当李承晚傀儡政府用于“讨伐”人民游击队和挑拨内战的炮灰。
    南朝鲜伪“国民议会”已于三月三十日宣布“正式批准”允许美国军事“顾问”团在南朝鲜公开活动，并接受以统治南朝鲜为目的的美国军事“援助”。
