Some Experiences in Developing Workers' Spare-Time Education

Based on the work during this period, I have learned that to develop spare-time schools, it is best to achieve the following: (1) Establish a unified leadership organization to seek close cooperation from all parties and resolve all issues in a timely manner. (2) Clarify that it is the responsibility of public and private primary and secondary schools to run spare-time schools and actively solve the problems of school sites and teachers themselves. (3) Strive to use all possible forces to advance the work. Facts have proven that leadership's attention is the primary condition for running spare-time schools well, and it also makes it easier to solve difficult problems. For example, the steel plant built classrooms for the spare-time school; the tram company set up full-time cadres and adjusted shifts; the military representatives of the bicycle factory and the rubber factory personally checked attendance after the school started, and the number of students enrolled in these two factories accounted for more than 90% of the total number of workers; the Fourth Cadre Spare-Time School run by the Public Security Bureau had the bureau chief make a mobilization report before enrollment, and the division chiefs and section chiefs took the lead in learning, with Party members guaranteeing, which set off a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture. (4) When mobilizing workers in private factories to enroll in school, we should conduct extensive publicity and individual in-depth education and explanation to eliminate certain capitalists' concerns. During this mobilization, because some capitalists did not understand the purpose of workers' enrollment, they used methods such as overtime work and delayed dinners to prevent workers from enrolling. In order to dispel these people's concerns, the hardware branch of the handicraft industry association convened a forum of managers of private factories, and managers of factories with workers studying in spare-time schools introduced the good impact of workers' learning on production, so that the capitalists had a correct understanding of spare-time schools. In addition, some spare-time schools also absorbed capitalists to join the school committee.

Other things like opening up the thinking of cadres responsible for publicity and mobilization, simplifying registration procedures, doing a good job in preparation, and cultivating professional cadres are all very necessary.

Strengthen Leadership, Establish Systems, and Continue to Consolidate Spare-Time Schools

At present, the city is continuing to consolidate the work of various spare-time schools. The person in charge of the Municipal Education Bureau also specifically put forward the following points at the work briefing meeting of the cultural and educational sections of various districts held on the 8th: Responsible cadres at all levels must attach importance to spare-time schools ideologically and must not relax leadership; at the same time, the work of spare-time schools should be listed as one of the main contents of inspection work. Each spare-time school should earnestly implement the principal responsibility system and establish various formal systems according to the requirements of the workers. All districts, schools, factories, institutions, trade unions, and relevant departments should strengthen connections and solve all problems in a timely manner. In addition, each school should carefully select teachers and strengthen teachers' professional learning; teaching should be combined with practice, and research should be conducted to solve the problem of teaching materials.

　　开展工人业余教育的几点体会
    根据这一时期的工作，体验到要展开业余学校，最好作到下列各点：（一）成立统一领导机构，求得各方面的紧密配合，及时解决一切问题。（二）明确开办业余学校是公私立中小学校的责任，由自己主动解决校址问题、教师问题。（三）争取一切可能使用的力量，推进工作。事实证明，领导上重视是办好业余学校的首要条件，同时也容易解决困难问题。如制钢厂给业余学校盖了教室；电车公司设脱产干部，调动班次；自行车厂、橡胶工厂的军代表在开学后亲自查堂，该两厂入学人数占工人总数的百分之九十以上；公安局办的第四干部业余学校，在入学前由局长作动员报告，处长、科长带头学习，党员保证，掀起了学习文化的热潮。（四）在动员私营工厂工人入学时，应广泛宣传，并个别地深入地进行教育解释，消除某些资方的顾虑。在这次动员的时候，因为有的资方不明了工人入学的目的，曾用加班、迟吃晚饭等方法来阻止工人入学。为了打消这些人的顾虑，手工业的五金分会召集了私营工厂的经理开座谈会，由有工人在业余学校学习的工厂的经理，介绍工人学习后在生产上的好影响，使资方对业余学校有正确认识。另外，有的业余学校并吸收了资本家加入校委会。
    其他像打通负责宣传动员干部的思想，简化报名手续，作好准备工作，培养专业干部等，都是很必要的。
　　加强领导建立制度  继续巩固业余学校
    目前，该市正继续进行巩固各业余学校的工作。市教育局负责人并在八日举行的各区文教股汇报工作会议上，特别提出了下列几点：各级负责干部要从思想上重视业余学校，不能放松领导；同时把业余学校工作列为检查工作主要内容之一。各业余学校要认真执行校长负责制，并根据工人要求，订立各种正规制度。各区、各学校和工厂、机关、工会及有关部门要加强联系，及时解决一切问题。此外，各校要慎选师资，加强教师的业务学习；教学要与实际相结合，并研究解决教材问题。（白山）
