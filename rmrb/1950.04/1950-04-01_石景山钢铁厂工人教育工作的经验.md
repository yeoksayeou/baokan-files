　　Experiences in Worker Education at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

　　The achievements of worker education at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant over the past year have been significant. In addition to political education through large lectures, a training course and three "Worker Schools" were held, and several literacy classes and technical training classes were organized, with a total of approximately 1,700 workers participating in learning.
　　Through this education, the political consciousness of the workers has generally improved, a new attitude towards labor has been initially established, and they have a basic understanding of issues such as the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, and the status and responsibilities of the working class. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for labor has increased, and a new record of 330 tons of iron was created last December, exceeding the pre-liberation level by 70 percent. At the same time, in coordination with the Party's education, forty or fifty cadres were cultivated; the workers' enthusiasm for learning has also increased, laying the foundation for the establishment of a regularized spare-time school this time.
　　Based on the experiences of worker education at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant over the past year, the following are some insights:
　　1. In the early stages of factory liberation, it was entirely correct and necessary to carry out political enlightenment education; however, after the workers' consciousness has been initially raised and production has returned to normal, education work focusing on culture and technology should be carried out, while systematically strengthening political education. According to the workers' requirements and possible conditions, regularized spare-time schools should be established, and long-term and clear educational guidelines should be formulated to improve workers' culture step by step and in a planned way. According to a survey of 2,290 workers in the factory, 50 percent want to learn culture and 30 percent want to learn technology. Among these workers, illiterates and semi-illiterates account for 70 percent. If the cultural level is not improved, it will be difficult to rapidly improve technical learning and political learning.
　　2. Worker spare-time education work must closely rely on the masses and mobilize workers to run and learn on their own. At the same time, fixed teachers should be set up, systems should be established, and the trade union should provide specific leadership and assistance. The leadership organization for learning should be streamlined and powerful, and the grassroots learning groups must be strengthened. When the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant ran the second "Worker School," it did not involve workers in learning management, but relied solely on a few cadres designated by the trade union. As a result, many tasks could not be implemented because the part-time cadres themselves were very busy; in addition, the teachers often changed, which led to low enthusiasm for learning among the workers, and the number of people attending classes became less and less, until only one-third remained. When the third "Worker School" started, the slogan of "running the school by everyone" was put forward, and workers elected branch school principals and team leaders, and strengthened grassroots group activities. This not only cultivated a large number of learning backbones among the workers, but also maintained an attendance rate of over 70 percent in learning performance.
　　3. The close cooperation of the Party, government, trade union, and youth league to ensure learning time is a prerequisite for running spare-time schools well. The factory had not done this before, and overtime, meetings, and learning often conflicted, which was also an important reason for the gradual decrease in the number of people attending classes in each "Worker School." The workers in the factory's machine repair shop had spontaneously run three literacy classes, but they were suspended one after another due to too much overtime and meetings. Therefore, when the regular spare-time school was opened this time, special emphasis was placed on the joint guarantee of the Party, government, trade union, and youth league, and efforts were made to ensure that there would be no overtime or meetings on learning days.

　　石景山钢铁厂工人教育工作的经验
    周耀东
    一年来，石景山钢铁厂工人教育工作的成绩是很大的。除采用上大课等方式进行政治教育外，前后举办了一期训练班和三期“职工学校”，还组织了一些识字班和技术训练班，共计约有一千七百工人参加了学习。
    经过这些教育，职工的政治觉悟普遍提高，初步的建立了新的劳动态度，对中国共产党与工人阶级的关系、工人阶级的地位与责任等问题已有了基本认识。因之，工人的劳动热情提高，去年十二月曾创造产铁三百三十吨的新纪录，超过解放前百分之七十。同时，配合党的教育，培养了四五十名干部；工人的学习情绪亦因之提高，为此次设立正规化的业余学校创立了基础。
    根据石景山钢铁厂一年来工人教育工作的经验，有如下几点体会：
    一、工厂解放的初期，进行政治启蒙教育是完全正确的和必要的；但当工人觉悟已初步提高，生产走入正常以后，则应开展以文化、技术为主的教育工作，同时有系统的加强政治教育。根据工人的要求及可能的条件，创设正规化的业余学校，制订长期的、明确的教育方针，有步骤有计划的来提高工人文化。据该厂里工二千二百九十个人中的调查：要求学文化的占百分之五十，要求学技术的占百分之三十。这些工人的文化程度，文盲和半文盲占百分之七十，如不提高文化程度，技术学习与政治学习也难迅速提高。
    二、工人业余教育工作，必须紧密依靠群众，发动工人自办自学。同时，设置固定的教员，订立制度，工会加以具体领导和帮助。学习的领导组织要精简有力，基层的学习小组必须加强。石景山钢铁厂办第二期“职工学校”时，在学习管理上没有吸收职工参加，光凭工会指定的几个干部去办。结果，由于兼职干部本身工作很忙，很多工作不能贯彻下去；再加上教员常变动，致使工人学习情绪不高，上课人数愈来愈少，到后来只剩三分之一了。第三期“职工学校”开始时，就提出了“大家办学”的口号，由工人选出分校校长及班组长，并加强了基层小组活动。这样不但培养了大批工人的学习骨干。在学习成绩上亦保持了百分之七十以上的出席率。
    三、党、政、工、团共同密切配合，保证学习时间，这是办好业余学校的先决条件。该厂以前没有作到这一点，加班、开会和学习经常发生冲突，这也是各期“职工学校”上课人数逐渐减少的重要原因。该厂机修场工人，曾自发地办过三个识字班，也因为加班、开会太多而先后陷于停顿。所以这次开办正规业余学校时，特别强调党政工团共同保证，争取作到学习日不加班，不开会。
