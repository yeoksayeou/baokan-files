　　Attention Fresh Egg Distributors to Tianjin

　　At the beginning of its business this year, the China Egg Products Company determined the acquisition areas and acquisition figures for different seasons for each branch company. The main method of acquisition is through cooperatives at all levels to complete the acquisition tasks. However, at present, quite a few state-owned stores and cooperatives in various regions are transporting large quantities of fresh eggs to Tianjin, directly contacting the company for transactions. This will cause a large concentration of fresh eggs in Tianjin, which will not only affect the egg sources in other regions, but also affect the planned production of egg factories outside Tianjin. In addition, the longer the distance of transportation of fresh eggs, the greater the loss than selling them locally. Therefore, state-owned stores or cooperatives in various regions should not only consider that the egg price in Tianjin is slightly higher than in other regions, but should also give more consideration to transportation losses and the overall planned acquisition and production. It is hoped that state-owned stores or cooperatives in various regions will adopt this suggestion to avoid unnecessary losses.

　　The addresses of the branch companies of the China Egg Products Company are as follows: East China Region, Jinan Branch, Shanghai Branch. Central South Region, Kaifeng Branch, Hankou Branch. North China Region, Beijing Branch, Shijiazhuang Branch, Zhangjiakou Branch, Gui Sui Branch. In addition, small groups are set up in major fresh egg distribution markets, or cooperatives are entrusted to purchase on their behalf. Various regions can directly contact them.

　　鲜蛋运津推销者注意
    中国蛋品公司于今年业务开始时，即确定了各分支公司的收购地区与不同季节的收购数字。在收购方式上，是以通过各级合作社来完成收购任务为主。但目前尚有不少地区的公营商店与合作社，将大量鲜蛋运津，直接与该公司接洽交易。这将使各地鲜蛋大量集中天津，不仅影响其他地区之蛋源，并影响天津以外各蛋厂之有计划生产。另外，鲜蛋过远的运输比在就近销售要增加很大的耗损。因此各地公营商店或合作社不应只从天津蛋价略高于其他地区这一点来着想，而应在运输耗损，与整个有计划的收购与生产方面更多的加以考虑。这一点建议深望各地公营商店或合作社采纳，以免不应有的损失。
    中国蛋品公司之分支公司地址如下：华东区，济南分公司、上海分公司。中南区，开封分公司，汉口分公司。华北区，北京分公司，石家庄分公司，张家口分公司，归绥支公司。此外，在各主要鲜蛋集散市场均设有小组，或委托合作社代购，各地可以直接与之联系。
