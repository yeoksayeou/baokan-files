　　This is a book that describes the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and natural science, and it is a collection of several articles.

　　"Why should people engaged in natural science study Marxism-Leninism? I know that the Communist Party truly represents the interests of the people, so isn't it enough for me to follow it?"

　　"I now know that people engaged in natural science should study Marxism-Leninism. The trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals by the Soviet Maritime Territory Military Tribunal gave me a great lesson not long ago, but I am still not very clear about the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and natural science."

　　Aren't friends who study natural science often arguing and discussing similar questions as above? Therefore, the publication of "Marxism-Leninism and Natural Science" is very necessary at present.

　　In this book, Engels' "Introduction to 'Dialectics of Nature'" and "Dialectics" are two important essays. In the former, the author first provides an overview of the history of natural science, using historical facts to prove that the metaphysical worldview has become a "thing that must be discarded" as a result of its own development. Engels said: The Greek philosophers believed that nature is eternally produced and destroyed, constantly flowing, with unceasing movement and change. This view is only a kind of genius intuition; but what about us? We base it on strict scientific methods, on the results of experience. Therefore, it is even clearer. This article is of particular significance to those who have not yet abandoned, or are reluctant to abandon, that "thing that must be discarded."

　　"Dialectics" is a chapter in the book "Dialectics of Nature," where Engels briefly describes the general nature of dialectics. Some people often think that dialectics is only a law in social science, and do not know that it is also a law in natural science—or even deny its great role in natural science. In fact, the laws of dialectics are not mysterious or profound. Engels tells us that it is only drawn from the history of mankind and the history of nature. The law of dialectics is the most general law of the above two historical stages and human thought itself.

　　Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin not only made brilliant achievements in revolutionary theory and practice, but also made great contributions in natural science. Li Ya's article "Natural Science Illuminated by Marxism-Leninism" provides a brief description of the contributions of these four great human mentors in this regard, and proves historically that only under the banner of Marxism-Leninism can natural science have infinitely bright prospects.

　　The two articles, "Soviet Science - Advanced Science" and "American Science Serving Monopoly Forces and Militarists," should be read in contrast. From the former article, we see that the Soviet Union used atomic energy to change the course of rivers such as the Ob River in Siberia, and planned to turn tens of millions of hectares of deserts and depressions into fertile fields; biologists such as Michurin and Lysenko created many new plant varieties. What kind of situation do we see in the latter article? American monopoly capitalists control science in their own hands, handling it according to their own (not according to the people's!) will. In order to obtain excess profits and prevent the decline of fixed capital, they often deliberately fail to use new inventions. For example, the famous "General Motors Corporation" (a monopoly organization in the automobile industry) only used one percent of all the patent rights it enjoyed! These two articles, based on facts, thoroughly shatter the lies and fallacies of science being "neutral," science being "independent," and science being "irrelevant to politics."

　　In addition, the articles in this book are quite related to reality, especially Comrade Qian Zhengying's "Political Study and Professional Study" and Professor Pei Wenzhong's "Do People Who Study Natural Science Have to Study Marxism-Leninism?" The authors use the conclusions drawn from their own work to illustrate the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and natural science, which is especially specific and worthy of our careful study.

　　马列主义与自然科学（新书介绍）
    中国青年社编  青年出版社出版

    这是一本叙述马列主义与自然科学关系的书，是由几篇文字汇集而成的。
    “搞自然科学的人何必学马列主义呢？我认识了共产党是真正代表人民利益的，我跟着它走不就得了？”
    “我现在知道搞自然科学的人应该学习马列主义了。不久以前苏联滨海军区审讯日本细菌战犯就给了我很大的教训，但我还不大清楚马列主义与自然科学的关系究竟怎样。”
    类似以上的问题，一些研究自然科学的朋友们不是常常在争辩和讨论的吗？因此，“马列主义与自然科学”这本书的出版，在目前是非常需要的。
    在这本书中，恩格斯的“‘自然辩证法’导言”和“辩证法”是两篇重要的论文。在前一篇中，作者首先对自然科学的历史作了一个概述，用历史的事实证明了自然科学由于它自身发展的结果，使形而上学的世界观成为“必须摈弃的东西”。恩格斯说：希腊时代的哲学家们认为自然界是永远地产生与消灭、不断地流动、不休息的运动和变化着，这种观点只是一种天才的直觉；但是我们呢？却是以严格的科学方法，以经验为基础而研究的结果。因此也就更为明确。这篇文章对那些到今天还没有放弃，或者还舍不得放弃那“必须摈弃的东西”的人，具有特别重要的意义。
    “辩证法”是“自然辩证法”一书中的一章，恩格斯在这里简明地叙述了辩证法的一般性质。有些人往往以为辩证法只是社会科学中的法则，而不知道它也是自然科学中的法则——甚至否认它在自然科学中的伟大作用。事实上，辩证法的规律并没有什么神秘，也并不深奥。恩格斯告诉我们：它不过是从人类历史和自然界历史中抽引出来的。辩证法的规律就是上面两个历史阶段与人类思想本身的最一般的规律。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林不仅在革命理论和实践上有辉煌的成就，在自然科学上他们也有伟大的功绩。李亚的《在马列主义照耀下的自然科学》一文，他对这四位人类伟大导师在这方面的贡献分别作了扼要的叙述，并且以历史证明：只有在马列主义的旗帜下，自然科学才可能有无限光辉的前途。
    《苏联的科学——先进的科学》和《美国科学为垄断势力与军国主义者服务》这两篇文章应该对照着读。从前一篇文章中，我们看到了苏联利用原子能改变西伯利亚鄂毕河等河的河道，计划把几千万公顷的沙漠和洼地变成肥沃的田地；米邱林、李森科等生物学家创造了许多新的植物品种。在后一篇文章中，我们看到的是怎样一种情形呢？美国垄断资本家们把科学掌握在自己的手里，按照自己的（不是按照人民的！）意志来处理，为了获得超额利润，防止固定资本的跌落，常常故意不去利用新的发明，如有名的“通用汽车公司”（汽车工业的垄断机构），仅利用了它享有的全部专利权的百分之一！这两篇文章以事实为证，彻底地粉碎了科学“中立”，科学“独立”，“科学与政治无关”的谎言和谬论。
    此外，在本书中的文章，都相当联系到实际，特别是钱正英同志的“政治学习与业务学习”，裴文中教授的“学习自然科学的人是否要学马列主义”，作者都以自己工作中得出的结论，来说明马列主义与自然科学之间的关系，尤其具体，值得我们好好地研读。
