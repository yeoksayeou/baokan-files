Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th: Hebei Province's governments at all levels conducted a streamlining and staffing reduction effort from early December of last year to the end of January this year. This laid a good foundation for implementing the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" regarding staffing issues. The purpose of this reorganization was to adjust organizations based on the importance and urgency of tasks, reduce support staff, supplement essential professional cadres in key departments, strengthen political power organs, bolster economic departments, and provide some cadres with learning opportunities. To this end, the Provincial Government and all Special Districts established Staffing Review Committees to uniformly lead the streamlining efforts. Before the streamlining, governments and departments at all levels conducted ideological mobilization among all cadres, correcting the doubts of some cadres, enabling the streamlining work to proceed smoothly. The province's original total staffing was 114,238 people, which was reduced to 73,560 after the reorganization, a reduction of more than a quarter. Because the original staffing was not full, there was an actual surplus of 15,118 people. Of these, apart from those demobilized, assigned to work in grassroots villages, or studying, there remained 6,322 people, who have been concentrated in each Special District to form work teams, both studying and assisting in urgent tasks, awaiting unified disposition by higher authorities.

During this reorganization, the provincial leadership first focused on adjusting organizations, supplementing 995 cadres to cooperative, trade, industrial, and mining enterprises that had long been understaffed. According to incomplete statistics from five Special Districts and one city, county-level supply and marketing cooperatives alone were supplemented with 51 county-level cadres. To strengthen grassroots work, some cadres were also sent to work in grassroots villages. In addition, 2,000 veteran cadres who had participated in the revolution for a long time but had low educational levels were transferred to middle schools for study. Secondly, administrative divisions were adjusted. The province originally had 1,185 districts, which were consolidated into 1,002 districts: each district had approximately 45 villages and a population of 30,000. This strengthened district-level leadership. Some departments at the provincial and Special District levels were also adjusted based on the current work situation, reducing layers, thereby improving work efficiency.

During this reorganization and review in Hebei Province, a total of 4,960 people were found to have illegally, excessively, or repeatedly claimed expenses. In individual organs, family members and nannies were also listed under cadres' names, and enterprise-oriented organ production personnel were also included in the staffing. There were also cases of non-compliance with staffing regulations and unauthorized addition of personnel; some guesthouses regularly housed dozens or hundreds of people without assigning them work for extended periods. These phenomena have been corrected after review and organizational adjustments.

Generally, organs in Hebei Province were able to conduct staffing review and reorganization work with a serious and responsible attitude. However, some individual organs adopted simple reduction methods, affecting the morale of cadres. Some organs also failed to consider the overall situation and were reluctant to streamline; surplus cadres were also unwilling to be sent to higher authorities, remaining in their own organs as "mobile forces," making it impossible for higher authorities to accurately determine the precise numbers. These factors affected the smooth progress of staffing work.

　　河北去冬进行整编
    减少层次提高工作效率         
    发现冒领重领经费人员近五千名
    【新华社保定四日电】河北省各级人民政府曾在去年十二月初至今年一月底，进行了一次精简编制的工作，为执行中央人民政府政务院“关于统一全国财政经济工作的决定”中关于编制问题的规定打下良好基础。该次整编的目的，是根据工作的轻重缓急调整组织，减少勤杂人员，补足各重要部门必需的业务干部，加强政权机构，充实经济部门，并使部分干部得到学习的机会。为此，省府及各专区都曾成立了清点编制委员会，以统一领导精简编制工作。各级政府、各部门在精简编制前，都向全体干部进行了思想动员，纠正了某些干部的疑虑，使精简工作得以顺利进行。全省原编制总计十一万四千二百三十八人，编后为七万三千五百六十人，约减少了四分之一强。因原编制未满员，实编余一万五千一百十八人。其中除复员、分配到基点村工作或学习的以外，尚余六千三百二十二人，已分别集中在各专区组成工作队，一面学习，一面帮助突击性的工作，听候上级统一处理。
    在此次整编中，省领导机关首先注意了调整组织，对长期得不到补充的合作、贸易、工矿等企业部门，补充了九百九十五个干部。据五个专区一个市的不完全统计，仅各县供销社就补充了县级干部五十一人。为加强下层工作，又派了部分干部到基点村去工作。此外，还调了参加革命时间较长而文化水平很低的老干部二千人到中学学习。其次是调整区划。全省原有一千一百八十五个区，经调整合并为一千零二个区：每区约四十五个村，三万人口。区级领导因此得以加强，省及各专区两级的有些部门，也根据当前工作情况作了调整，减少层次，因而提高了工作效率。
    河北省在此次整编清点中，曾发现各地冒领、多领或重领经费的人员共达四千九百六十余人。个别机关家属、保姆也顶干部名字，企业化的机关生产人员也列入编制，还有不遵守编制和擅自增添人员的；有的招待所则经常住着数十人或百余人，长久不分配工作。这种现象在经过清点与调整组织后已得到纠正。
    河北省一般机关此次均能以认真负责的态度来进行清点整编的工作，但也有个别机关采取简单的裁减方法，影响了干部情绪。还有些机关不从全局着想，迟迟不肯精简；编余干部也不愿送到上级，留在自己机关里作“机动力量”，致使上级始终闹不清精确人数。这些都影响到编制工作的顺利进行。
