　　Answering the Provocations of the Warmongers
    The incident on April 8th in which American military aircraft brazenly violated the Soviet border was a provocation against the peace-loving people of the world by American imperialist adventurers. As pointed out in the Soviet government's statement to the US government, this was "an act that flagrantly violates the fundamental norms of international law."

    The American thugs, who are frantically preparing for a war of aggression, want to hold naval exercises in the Southwest Pacific and military exercises in northern Canada, but they are troubled by the fact that they cannot conduct such exercises off the Soviet coast to scout Soviet defenses and test whether the airfields in Denmark and naval bases in Norway near the Soviet Union can be used by the United States. To achieve this goal, they recklessly intruded into Soviet airspace with military aircraft. The Soviet Air Force fulfilled its duty to guard the border and defend peace. They demanded that the American aircraft that had invaded their territory land. The American aircraft ignored them and fired on Soviet aircraft. After the Soviet aircraft returned fire, the American aircraft were forced to flee. The United States then announced that the aircraft was "missing" and then used this as an excuse to conduct large-scale air force exercises in the Baltic Sea region. One or two days before the American aircraft intruded into the Soviet Union, American air force officers flew to the Kastrup Airport in Denmark; several days earlier, American ammunition boxes were being transported in this airport. After April 8, American aircraft continued to fly to this airport. In the shameful actions of the American aircraft, they also openly flew over the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. American press officers openly declared that American aircraft would "search" Danish and Norwegian territory. The attitude of the Danish and Norwegian governments toward this incident was a shameful surrender to the dictates of the American imperialists. All of this proves that this incident was a criminal conspiracy planned long ago by American warmongers.

    This incident has made the people of Denmark and Sweden more aware of the ugly faces of the American imperialists and their own reactionary rulers; it has made the people of the world more aware that war adventurers will stop at nothing to achieve their evil goals. We must unite the forces of all peace-loving people and wage a resolute struggle to defend world peace. The people of all countries understand how to respond to the provocative actions of warmongers. The peace signature campaign is unfolding on a large scale all over the world, peace conferences including representatives from all walks of life are being held in many countries, and actions to refuse to transport American military supplies are developing from France, Italy, and Belgium to North Africa and other places. The Chinese people are effectively defending peace with practical actions such as thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits, completely expelling American aggressive forces from China, and strengthening the construction of a new democratic country. American aircraft also used to fly wantonly in Chinese airspace, and the US Marines also occupied Qingdao and other places in China during the Kuomintang rule, and held military exercises in many places to intimidate the Chinese people. But the Chinese people have never been intimidated by these provocations of imperialism. The effective guarding of the borders by the Soviet Union has set an example for us. The Chinese people must also, like the Soviet Union, guard our borders and defend world peace.

　　回答战争挑拨者的挑衅
    四月八日美国军用飞机蛮横侵犯苏联边境的事件，是美国帝国主义冒险家对全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅。正如苏联政府向美国政府的声明中所指出的，这是“闻所未闻地违犯了国际公法基本法规的行径”。
    疯狂准备侵略战争的美国暴徒们，要在西南太平洋举行海军演习，要在加拿大北部举行军事演习，但他们却苦于无法在苏联海岸进行这样的演习，以侦察苏联的防务，并试验在苏联附近的丹麦的飞机场、挪威的海军基地，是否可供美国使用。为了实现这个目的，他们以军用机狂妄地侵入苏联领空。苏联空军尽了他们警卫边境、保卫和平的职责，他们要求侵入国境的美机降落，美机竟置之不理，并向苏联飞机射击。苏联飞机还击之后，美机就被迫逃逸了。于是，美国就宣布飞机“失踪”，然后以此为借口，在波罗的海区域进行大规模的空军演习。在美机侵入苏联的前一两天，美国空军军官就飞抵丹麦的加斯特鲁普机场；更早几天，美国弹药箱就在这个机场中搬运着了。四月八日以后，美国飞机就继续不断飞到这个机场去。在美机的可耻行径中，他们还公然飞越瑞典的卡尔斯克罗那海军基地。美国新闻官公然宣称美机要“搜寻”丹麦、挪威的领土。丹麦和挪威政府对这事件的态度则是可耻地顺从美帝国主义者的摆布。这一切都证明这个事件是美国战争挑拨者早就安排好了的罪恶阴谋。
    这事件使丹麦、瑞典人民更认清了美帝国主义者和他们本国的反动统治者的丑恶面目；使全世界人民都更认清了战争冒险家们为了达到他们的罪恶目的是不择手段的。我们必须紧紧团结一切爱好和平的人们的力量，为保卫世界和平作坚决的斗争。世界各国人民是懂得如何回答战争挑拨者的挑衅行为的。和平签名运动正在全世界各地大规模展开，包括着各阶层人民代表的和平大会正在许多国家举行，拒运美国军火的行动从法国、意大利、比利时直到北非等地都在发展着。中国人民正以彻底肃清国民党残匪、完全驱逐美国侵略势力退出中国、加强新民主主义国家建设的实际行动，有效地捍卫着和平。美国飞机也曾在中国领空肆无忌惮地飞行，美海军陆战队也曾于国民党统治时在中国窃据过青岛等地，在许多地方举行过军事演习，恐吓中国人民。但是中国人民从来没有被帝国主义的这些挑衅所吓倒。苏联对于国境线有效的警卫，更给我们作了一个榜样。中国人民也要像苏联那样，警卫我们的边疆，保卫世界和平。
