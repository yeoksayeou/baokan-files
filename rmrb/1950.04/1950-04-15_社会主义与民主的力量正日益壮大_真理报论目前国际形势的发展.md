　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Fourteenth: Pravda published an editorial on the 12th entitled "The Forces of Socialism and Democracy are Growing and Becoming Stronger," stating: The development of the current international situation shows that the forces of socialism and democracy are constantly growing and winning more and more victories. The Soviet Union is an indestructible fortress of socialism and democracy. The People's Democratic countries are confidently moving towards socialism, progressing and becoming stronger. The epoch-making victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is another devastating blow to the entire imperialist system. The world proletariat's class struggle against the bourgeoisie is intensifying, and the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries are developing. The Soviet state, founded by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, has become the decisive progressive force of our time and brings all mankind closer to an era of happiness.
　　The entire course of historical development is making the vast majority of people in the world more and more actively participate in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The peace camp is constantly growing and becoming stronger, while the imperialist reactionary camp is weakening. The increasingly serious blows of panic are shattering the economies of imperialist countries, especially that of the United States. Mass unemployment and unprecedented impoverishment of the working masses are occurring alongside production cuts. The general crisis of imperialism is deepening and becoming more acute, and the struggles and quarrels within the camp of imperialist plunderers are becoming increasingly clear. An atmosphere of hopelessness and instability pervades the imperialist camp. Filled with a bestial fear of the future, the imperialist bandits are doing everything possible to prolong the life of dying capitalism. The American reactionaries, posing as the "savior" of capitalism, unscrupulously use the most despicable means to attack socialism and democracy. They utilize the fascist Tito scum—typical traitors, the right-wing social-democratic lackeys of capitalism, the Vatican, and the reactionary upper echelons of the Catholic clergy. The most despicable slander and atomic blackmail, espionage and sabotage, terror and bribery, conspiracy organizations and incitement of hatred between nations—all of these are the vicious tricks played by the ruling cliques of the United States and Britain in carrying out their misanthropic conspiracies.
　　However, all the efforts and attempts of the capitalist gentlemen are in vain. The scale of the working people's struggle against imperialism for peace, democracy, and socialism is becoming increasingly broad. The will of the people of all countries to strive for peace is vividly expressed in the fact that all progressive humanity actively supports the appeal of the Stockholm meeting of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress. Peace advocates are not limited to publicizing and agitating for peace but are beginning to take practical actions to stop the warmongers. The most convincing example of this is the refusal of workers in Western Europe to unload ships carrying American military equipment and to manufacture weapons for another war of aggression prepared by the American and British imperialists.
　　The powerful socialist and democratic camp, engaged in peaceful creative labor, is vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the imperialist war-makers. Ordinary people all over the world hail the Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy. The all-conquering ideas of Lenin and Stalin illuminate the people of all countries, leading them towards a happy future.

　　社会主义与民主的力量正日益壮大
　　——真理报论目前国际形势的发展
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十二日以《社会主义与民主的力量正日益成长壮大》为题发表社论称：目前国际形势的发展，表明社会主义与民主的力量正在不断成长，而且赢得了越来越多的胜利。苏联是社会主义与民主的不可摧毁的堡垒。人民民主国家满怀信心地朝着社会主义迈进，它们在进步着，并且更加强有力了。中国人民革命划时代的胜利，乃是对帝国主义整个体系的又一毁灭性打击。世界无产阶级反对资产阶级的阶级斗争正日益加紧，殖民地与附属国的民族解放运动正在发展中。苏联人民在列宁、斯大林党的领导下所创立的苏维埃国家，已经成为我们这个时代的决定性的进步力量，并使全人类更接近幸福的时代。
    整个历史发展的过程，使世界上绝大多数的人愈来愈积极地参加为和平、民主和社会主义而进行的斗争。和平阵营正在始终不断地增长壮大，而帝国主义反动阵营却日益削弱。日益严重的恐慌的打击，使帝国主义国家的经济支离破碎，首先是使美国的经济支离破碎。大量失业和劳动群众的空前贫困化，正与生产减缩俱来。帝国主义的总危机日益加深，而且已变得愈来愈尖锐了，帝国主义掠夺者阵营内部的斗争和争吵，正在愈来愈明晰地暴露出来。无望与不稳的气氛，笼罩着帝国主义阵营。帝国主义强盗们充满着对未来的兽性的恐惧，便想尽办法以延长垂死的资本主义的寿命。美国反动派把自己装成资本主义的“救世主”，肆无忌惮地使用最卑鄙的手段来进攻社会主义与民主。他们利用法西斯的铁托败类——典型的叛徒，资本主义的右翼社会党从仆，梵蒂冈和天主教教士的反动上层人士。最卑鄙的诽谤与原子讹诈，间谍活动与阴谋破坏，恐怖与贿赂，阴谋组织与煽起各民族间的仇恨，所有这一切，都是美英统治集团在推行他们的仇恨人类的阴谋诡计时所玩弄的凶恶的伎俩。
    然而，资本主义的大人先生们的一切努力和企图都是徒然的。劳动人民为和平、民主和社会主义而进行的反对帝国主义的斗争，其规模正越来越广泛。各国人民争取和平的意志，生动地表现在全体进步人类积极支持世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的呼吁书一事上。和平拥护者并不局限于宣传及鼓动和平，而且开始以实际行动来制止战争贩子。关于这一点的最具有说服性的例子，就是西欧工人拒绝为装载美国军备的船只卸货，并拒绝为美英帝国主义者所准备的另一次侵略战争制造武器。
    从事和平的创造性劳动的、强大的社会主义及民主阵营，在警觉地注视着帝国主义战争制造者的阴谋。全世界的普通人民都欢呼苏联爱好和平的外交政策。列宁和斯大林战胜一切的思想，照耀着各国人民，向幸福的将来迈进。
