Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th: The first phase of Shandong's Yellow River spring repair project has been completed in all areas except for the Jinan region. The main tasks of the first phase of Shandong's spring repair project were to raise and thicken the Yellow River embankment, repair damaged sections, and increase and build up the dam foundations. This project, which started on March 6, involved approximately 80,000 people working on the dikes daily. By April 5, within a month, a total of 1,427,300 laborers were mobilized, completing 1,054,700 cubic meters of earthwork. During the project, most areas implemented the standard of ramming each clod of earth three times, with Gaoqing, Zhangli and other counties even exceeding 2.5 inches per clod, reaching the highest requirements for project strength. In the course of Yellow River control, various localities simultaneously integrated production with disaster relief work. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 12,600 disaster victims participated in the dike repair, with an average daily wage of four to five catties of grain per person. Localities also launched emulation campaigns during the dike repair, conducting immediate evaluations and rewards for the laborers, which played a significant role in ensuring project quality and improving work efficiency. For long-distance earth transportation, the system of issuing tickets for recording work was generally implemented, while for short distances, work was also recorded and rated, implementing the wage policy of more pay for more work.

　　山东第一期治黄工程大部完成
    【新华社济南十四日电】山东第一期黄河春修工程，除济南地区外已全部竣工。山东第一期春修工程主要是将黄河大堤加高培厚、修补残缺以及坝基的增添加高堆集等工程。这一工程自三月六日动工后，每天约有八万余人上堤做工。至四月五日一个月内，共动员民工一百四十二万七千三百余人，完成土方一百零五万四千七百余方。在工程进行时，一般地区均执行了每坯土打三遍套硪的标准，高青、章历等县甚至每坯土超过两公寸五，达到工程强度的最高要求。在治黄中，各地同时结合了生产救灾工作。据不完全统计，此次参加修堤的灾民，计有一万二千六百余人，平均每人每天得工资粮四斤至五斤。各地在修堤中并开展了立功运动，对民工进行随评随奖，对贯彻工程质量，提高工作效率起了很大的保证作用。远距离的运土，一般都做到了发签记功，近距离也做到记功评分，贯彻了多劳多得的工资政策。
