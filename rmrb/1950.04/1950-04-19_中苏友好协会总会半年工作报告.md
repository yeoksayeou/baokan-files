Semi-Annual Work Report of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters
Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters was established on October 5, 1949. Prior to this, local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations had already been established in Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Bei'an, Fushun, Dalian, and other places in Northeast China to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda and education work. Preparations for organizing a national headquarters began in July 1949.

During the preparatory period, the preparatory committee, in addition to actively carrying out various preparatory tasks, also issued a declaration calling on various regions to organize friendship associations to carry out various propaganda activities. At that time, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Zhangjiakou, Xuzhou, and other places had already begun preparing to establish branch associations. The Northeast regions summarized the initial work of the friendship associations and established general and branch associations. On October 5, the National Headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was formally established. At the inaugural meeting, the declaration and charter of the Friendship Association were adopted, the president and council members were elected, the nature and tasks of the Friendship Association were defined, and a secretariat was organized. From then on, truly national mass-based Friendship Association work gradually unfolded.

The following is a brief summary of the main work of the Headquarters in the six months since its establishment:

A. Temporary Propaganda, Education, and Friendship Work:

1. Welcoming the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation. At the time of the Headquarters' establishment, the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, led by Fadeyev and Simonov as the head and deputy head respectively, came to New China at the invitation of our association to participate in the inaugural meeting of our association. They stayed in China for a month. At that time, the friendship association organizations and other mass organizations in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places invited them to give a total of 57 special lectures, attended by 77,200 people; 29 large and small gatherings were held, with a participation of 563,200 people, which greatly enhanced the Chinese people's understanding of the Soviet Union. For commemorative purposes, our association specially compiled "The Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation in China for a Month."

2. Commemorating the 32nd Anniversary of the October Revolution. The Headquarters held grand celebrations and organized a delegation led by Ding Ling to go to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution. Local organizations also enthusiastically commemorated the event. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 40 cities across the country carried out various celebration activities, with a total mass participation of 915,500 people in 20 of those cities.

3. Celebrating the 70th Birthday of Marshal Stalin. The Headquarters took the lead in launching celebrations and held a birthday celebration. Various regions enthusiastically launched various birthday celebration activities. According to incomplete statistics, enthusiastic celebrations were launched in 47 cities, with a total mass participation of 1,313,700 people in 18 of those cities.

4. Inviting Soviet Experts to China to Lecture. Seven people, including Kemenov and Nuzhdin, have been invited. The first group to come to China included Dr. Nuzhdin in Biology, Dr. Giselev in History, and Master Makarov in Economics. The three gave 27 lectures in Beijing, attended by 25,300 people; and held five discussion forums. They then went to Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places to continue lecturing. Master Baudrev in Economics, who came to China after the three professors, gave eight lectures and held seven discussion forums in Beijing, and has now left Beijing to lecture in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. The third group, including Kemenov, will come to China at the end of April.

5. Celebrating the Signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Headquarters called on various regions to launch celebration and propaganda activities. According to incomplete statistics, mass rallies, lectures, and forums were held in Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Hubei, Chahar, Hebei, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Xinxiang, Beijing, Dezhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, and other places, and propaganda celebrations were carried out among the masses through street propaganda, costumed performances, and other forms. The Liaoxi Branch Association also called on all members to write letters to their relatives and friends to explain the new Sino-Soviet Treaty.

The above activities not only demonstrated the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet Union, but also educated the broad masses of the people nationwide, enabling them to improve their understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet relations, and also provided great assistance to our academic circles and economic construction.

B. Regular Work:

(1) Publishing Various Books and Periodicals. The Headquarters edits and publishes the monthly magazine "Sino-Soviet Friendship," which has been published for six issues, each with approximately 150,000 characters. In North China alone, the average number of copies distributed per issue is 15,000. The Headquarters published two types of Soviet science series (namely, "Heredity and Variation" by Lysenko and "The Basic Principles of Michurin Biology" by Stolev); and published "The Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation in China for a Month." Various general and branch associations have published the following publications: The Northeast General Branch Association published "Introduction to the Soviet Union," Dalian published "Friendship," Chahar published "Sino-Soviet Friendship," Qingdao published "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Journal," Jinan published "Sino-Soviet Friendship," Wuhan published "Beneficial Friend," Lanzhou published "Friendship," Nanjing published "Sino-Soviet Voice," Tianjin published "Special Issue on the Establishment of the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," Shanghai published "Special Issue on the October Revolution," Wuhu published "Sino-Soviet Friendship Documents," and Yangzhou published "Journal." Harbin and Lushun-Dalian both issued pictorials, and various regions also compiled and printed many popular pamphlets from time to time. In order to exchange experiences and promote work, the Headquarters will soon publish "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Newsletter," and the Northeast General Branch Association has already published "Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship," and Harbin has published "Sino-Soviet Friendship" to guide the work of the Friendship Association itself.

(2) Touring Film Screenings. With the help of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (which donated 15 films), the Headquarters screened Soviet films 387 times in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xi'an, Baoji, Xianyang, Wugong, Gaoling, and other places, with a total audience of 893,434 people. Friendship associations in various regions attach great importance to film education: the Beijing Branch Association screened Soviet films 167 times in January, February, and March this year, with a total audience of 200,2759 people; the Northeast screened Soviet films 839 times in the past six months, with an audience of 2,202,800 people.

(3) Holding Photo Exhibitions. The Headquarters received four sets of photos donated by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries: (1) "Soviet Construction Photos," which were exhibited in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Hankou, Wuchang, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and other places for a total of 92 days, with a total audience of 313,898 people. (2) "Soviet Women's Work and Life Photos," which were exhibited in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Nanjing for a total of 56 days, with an audience of 169,397 people (currently being exhibited in Shanghai). (3) "Photos of the 32nd Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Union," which were exhibited in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xi'an, Baoji, Xianyang, Wugong, Gaoling, and other places for a total of 46 days, with an audience of 116,278 people. (4) "Photos Commemorating the 26th Anniversary of Lenin's Death," which were exhibited in Beijing, Jinan, and Nanjing for a total of 39 days, with an audience of 110,612 people. In total, the above exhibitions lasted for 233 days, with an audience of over 740,000 people. In addition, the Headquarters held more than ten issues of "Window on the Soviet Union" in Beijing. There were more than 20 large and small photo exhibitions organized by various regions. The Beijing Friendship Association held 24 exhibitions in January, February, and March this year, with 11,950 visitors. The Northeast held 153 exhibitions in the past six months, with 1,269,350 visitors. These exhibitions related to Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union have had a great impact on mass education.

(4) Holding Lectures, Broadcasts, Forums, Wall Newspapers, Singing, and Drama. Friendship associations in various regions mostly use the above forms to conduct specific education. Northeast China, Beijing, Hebei, Chahar, and other places have regular broadcasts or lectures. The Northeast has held more than 5,670 large and small gatherings in the past six months, with an estimated total audience of approximately 2,207,000 people. Dalian performed plays about Sino-Soviet friendship such as "Gratitude as Heavy as a Mountain," "Benefactor," "Old Wang Returns Home," "Replacing the Old with the New," "Two Sections of Iron Rods," and "Flowers of Friendship Bloom Everywhere," which played a broad and in-depth educational role among the local masses. The People's University of China recently compiled and performed "Profound Friendship," which is currently being revised.

(5) Establishing Russian Language Night Schools. The Headquarters sponsors a Russian language night school, the purpose of which is to gain experience in running amateur Russian language remedial education to guide the work of learning Russian in various regions. Currently, due to limited manpower and resources, only 228 students have been selected to participate in the study. There are 37 Russian language night schools in various parts of the Northeast, with 3,870 students. Other places such as Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Qingdao, and other places also have Russian language night schools. Radio stations in Beijing and other places have launched Russian language teaching, which has been enthusiastically welcomed by the masses in various places.

Through the above work, the broad masses have received great education. They have shown a new atmosphere in their actual life and work. For example, during the commemoration of the great October Revolution and the celebration of Marshal Stalin's birthday, railway workers in Qingdao rushed to repair a locomotive in a short period of time, naming it "Sino-Soviet Friendship"; railway employees in Tangshan and Xi'an also expressed their celebration with the same actions; workers in Taiyuan used voluntary labor to repair five locomotives in response to the birthday celebration movement, and 19 workers cleared 35 tons of coal slag in four hours. 20,000 people in Beijing rushed to the Soviet Embassy to present gifts and birthday wishes to Marshal Stalin; the masses in various places scrambled to buy Soviet books, read Soviet pictures and movies, and enthusiastically learn Russian, etc. These actions show that the Chinese people's love for the Soviet Union has greatly increased, and at the same time, the atmosphere of learning from the Soviet Union has begun to form.

C. Development of Friendship Association Organizations in Various Regions:

Due to the gradual improvement of the masses' political awareness and the organizational work of the Headquarters and various branch associations, Friendship Association organizations in various regions have developed rapidly. General branch associations have been established in Northeast China and South China. Provincial branch associations and directly affiliated municipal branch associations have been established in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, Rehe, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Ningxia, Henan, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Beijing, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Shenyang, Tianjin, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Jinan, Hangzhou, Guilin, Fuzhou, Kaifeng, Changsha, Nanchang, and other places. In Northeast China, Chahar, Hebei, and other regions, Friendship Association organizations have also developed to many small cities and some rural areas.

According to reports from various regions, as of now, the number of members nationwide has increased from 700,000 in November 1949 to more than 2,079,100 at present. According to statistics from Fushun City, among the 9,686 members, workers accounted for 35%, staff accounted for 23%, students accounted for 24%, and other personnel accounted for 18%; among the 2,052 members in Xinxiang City, workers accounted for 27%, students accounted for 29%, staff accounted for 18%, teachers accounted for 6%, and other citizens accounted for 15%; among the more than 36,000 members in Rehe Province, farmers accounted for half. From this, it seems that the foundation of Friendship Association organizations in various regions is mainly built on the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Although Friendship Association organizations have gradually spread throughout the country, their work is only at the beginning, and it is necessary to continue to work hard to develop and gradually consolidate the organization, carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, and establish and strengthen regular work.

In addition to generally strengthening the leadership of Friendship Association operations in various regions, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters should provide more and more various propaganda and educational materials related to Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union to various regions, and establish closer contact and cooperation with the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, so as to make the work of Friendship Associations throughout the country more widespread and in-depth, and achieve the purpose of enhancing and consolidating the permanent friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

　　中苏友好协会总会半年工作报告
    中苏友协总会总干事  钱俊瑞
    【新华社十七日讯】中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞在该会第一届理事会第一次会议上的半年工作报告，全文如下：
    中苏友好协会总会半年工作报告
    中苏友好协会总会成立于一九四九年十月五日。在此以前，东北的哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯、北安、抚顺、大连等地即已开始建立地方性的中苏友好协会，进行中苏友好宣传教育工作。一九四九年七月开始筹备组织全国性的总会组织。
    在总会筹备期间，筹委会除积极进行各项筹备工作外，并发表宣言，号召各地组织友协进行各种宣传工作。其时，上海、天津、济南、南京、青岛、郑州、张家口、徐州等地已经开始筹组分会支会。东北各地则总结了初期的友协工作，成立了总分会。十月五日，中苏友好协会全国总会正式成立。在成立大会上通过了友协的宣言和章程，选举了会长和理事，规定了友协的性质和任务；并组织了干事会。真正全国群众性的友协工作，从此才逐渐展开。
    兹将总会成立半年以来比较主要的工作简述如下：
    甲、临时的宣传教育与友好工作：
    一、欢迎苏联文化工作者代表团。总会成立时，以法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫为正副团长的苏联文化工作者代表团应本会之邀，来到新中国，参加本会成立大会。他们留在中国一个月。当时北京、天津、济南、南京、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨等地的友协组织及其他群众团体，请他们作专题讲演共五十七次，参加听讲者七万七千二百人；举行大小联欢会二十九次，参加人数五十六万三千二百人，大大提高了中国人民对苏联的认识。为留作纪念，本会特编了“苏联文化工作者代表团在中国一月”。
    二、纪念十月革命三十二周年。总会举行盛大庆祝，并组织出国代表团，由丁玲率领前往莫斯科参加十月革命三十二周年纪念典礼。各地组织也均热烈纪念，根据不完全统计，全国进行各种庆祝活动的共有四十余城市，其中二十个城市参加的群众共达九十一万五千五百人。
    三、庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰。总会首先发动庆祝并举行祝寿大会，各地热烈展开各种祝寿活动。根据不完全统计，曾有四十七个城市掀起热烈庆祝，其中十八个城市参加的群众共达一百三十一万三千七百人。
    四、邀请苏联专家来华讲学。已经应邀者有凯缅诺夫、努日金等七人。第一批来华者为生物学博士努日金、历史学博士吉谢列夫、经济学硕士马卡洛娃。三人在京讲学二十七次，听讲者二万五千三百人；举行座谈会五次；接着并去天津、南京、上海、杭州、汉口、广州、西安等地继续讲学。继三教授来华的经济学硕士包德列夫，在京讲演八次，举行座谈会七次，现已离京去上海、广州等地讲学。第三批凯缅诺夫等将于四月底来华。
    五、庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订活动。中苏条约签订后，总会即号召各地展开庆祝宣传活动。根据不完全统计，上海、南京、长沙、湖北、察哈尔、河北、辽东、辽西、新乡、北京、德州、郑州、天津等地都开群众大会、讲演会、座谈会，并采取街头宣传、化装演出等形式，深入群众进行宣传庆祝。辽西分会并号召所有会员各向自己亲友写信解释中苏新约。
    以上这些活动，不仅表现了中国人民对苏联的深厚友谊，而且教育了全国广大群众，使他们对苏联、对中苏关系的认识上得到提高，对我国学术界和经济建设方面也得到很大帮助。
    乙、经常性工作：
    （一）出版各种书刊。总会主编《中苏友好》月刊，已出刊六期，每期约十五万字，仅华北一地，每期发行册数平均即为一万五千册。总会出版了苏联科学丛刊两种（即李森科所著《遗传与变异》，斯托列夫所著《米丘林生物学的基本原理》）；并出版了《苏联文化工作者代表团在中国一月》。各地总分会和分会则出版了下列刊物：东北总分会为“苏联介绍”，大连为《友谊》，察哈尔为《中苏友谊》，青岛为《中苏友好会刊》，济南为《中苏友好》，武汉为《益友》，兰州为《友好》，南京为《中苏友声》，天津则出版了《天津市中苏友好协会成立特辑》，上海出版了《十月革命特刊》，芜湖出版了《中苏友好文献》，扬州出版了《会刊》。哈尔滨与旅大两地都发行了画报，各地还随时编印了不少通俗小册子。为交流经验推进工作，总会即将出版《中苏友协通讯》，东北总分会已出版了《东北中苏友好》，哈尔滨已出版了《中苏友好》，借以指导友协本身的业务。
    （二）巡回放映电影。总会在苏联对外文化协会的帮助下（他们赠送十五部影片），在北京、张家口、保定、石家庄、新乡、郑州、开封、西安、宝鸡、咸阳、武功、高陵等地放映苏联影片三百八十七场，共计观众八十九万三千四百三十四人。各地友协对电影教育均极重视：北京分会在今年一、二、三三个月内放映苏联电影一百六十七场，观众共为二十万零二千七百五十九人；东北半年来放映苏联电影八百三十九场，观众达二百二十万二千八百人。
    （三）举办图片展览。总会接到苏联对外文化协会赠送的图片四套：（１）“苏联建设图片”一套，曾在北京、天津、济南、张家口、汉口、武昌、长沙、郑州、开封、徐州等地先后展览共九十二天，共计观众三十一万三千八百九十八人。（２）“苏联妇女工作与生活图片”一套，曾在北京、天津、济南、南京四地先后展览五十六天，观众十六万九千三百九十七人（目前正在上海展览中）。（３）“苏联建国三十二周年图片”一套，曾在保定、石家庄、新乡、郑州、开封、西安、宝鸡、咸阳、武功、高陵等地先后展览四十六天，观众十一万六千二百七十八人。（４）“列宁逝世二十六周年纪念图片”一套，曾在北京、济南、南京三地展览三十九天，观众十一万零六百一十二人。总计以上各项展览天数共为二百三十三天，观众达七十四万以上。此外，总会又在北京举办“苏联之窗”十余期。各地自办的大小图展共有二十余次。北京友协在今年一、二、三三个月内共举行了二十四次，参观人数一万一千九百五十人。东北方面半年来共举行了一百五十三次，参观人数一百二十六万九千三百五十人。此类有关中苏友好和学习苏联的展览，在群众教育中发生了极大的影响。
    （四）举办讲演、广播、座谈、墙报、歌咏、戏剧等。各地友协大都利用上述各种形式进行具体的教育。东北、北京、河北、察哈尔等地都有定期的广播或讲演。东北半年来曾举行大小各种集会五千六百七十余次，统计历次听众共约二百二十万七千余人。大连演出了“恩重如山”、“恩人”、“老王还家”、“去旧换新”、“两节铁棍”、“友谊之花到处开”等关于中苏友谊的剧本，在当地群众中发挥了广泛而深入的教育作用。中国人民大学最近编演“深厚的友谊”，现正修改中。
    （五）创设俄文夜校。总会主办俄文夜校一所，其目的在取得办理业余俄文补习教育的经验，以指导各地学习俄文的工作。现因限于人力物力只考选了二百二十八名学员参加学习。东北各地的俄文夜校共有三十七处，学员达三千八百七十人。其他各地如保定、张家口、上海、汉口、广州、兰州、青岛等处都设有俄文夜校。北京等地广播电台举办了俄文讲授，受到各地群众的热烈欢迎。
    经过以上的各项工作，广大群众获得很大的教育。他们在实际生活和工作中表现出了新的气象。例如：在纪念伟大十月革命和庆祝斯大林大元帅寿辰时，青岛铁路工人在短期内抢修了一辆机车——命名“中苏友好”号；唐山和西安铁路员工也都以同样行动表示庆祝；太原工人为响应祝寿运动利用义务劳动修成了五辆机车，并由十九名工人在四小时内清除了三十五吨煤渣。北京二万群众奔向苏联大使馆，为斯大林大元帅献礼祝寿；各地群众争购苏联书籍，争阅苏联图片和电影，热烈学习俄文等等。这些行动，说明了中国广大群众热爱苏联的情绪已大为提高，同时，学习苏联的风气也开始形成。
    丙、各地友协组织的发展：
    由于群众政治觉悟逐渐提高和总会及各地分会的组织工作，各地友协组织随着迅速发展起来。东北和华南两大地区业已建立了总分会。省分会和直属市分会已建立者有黑龙江、吉林、辽东、辽西、松江、热河、河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、湖北、浙江、江西、宁夏、河南、绥远、内蒙、新疆、北京、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、沈阳、天津、苏南、苏北、皖北、南京、上海、汉口、重庆、广州、西安、兰州、济南、杭州、桂林、福州、开封、长沙、南昌等处。在东北、察哈尔及河北等地区，友协组织还发展到了许多小城市和一部分农村。
    根据各地报告，截至目前为止，全国会员已由一九四九年十一月间的七十万人增至现在的二百零七万九千一百余人。各地会员的成份，据抚顺市的统计，在九千六百八十六个会员中，工人占百分之三十五，职员占百分之二十三，学生占百分之二十四，其他人员占百分之十八；新乡市的二千零五十二个会员中，工人占百分之二十七，学生占百分之二十九，职员占百分之十八，教员占百分之六，其他市民占百分之十五；热河省的三万六千多会员中，农民占其半数。由此看来，各地友协组织的基础，主要是建筑在广大工农群众上。
    虽然友协组织已经逐渐遍及全国，但其工作还只在开端，还需要继续努力发展和逐步巩固组织，广泛深入地进行宣传教育，建立和加强经常工作。
    中苏友好协会总会，除应一般的加强对各地友协业务的领导外，尤应多多供给各地以各种有关中苏友好与学习苏联的宣传教育资料，并与苏联对外文化协会取得更密切的联系与配合，务使全国友协工作更加广泛深入地展开，达到增强与巩固中苏永久友谊的目的。
