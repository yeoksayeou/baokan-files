　　Improving Parcel Shipping Procedures
    Mr. Fan Fanwu Submits Suggestions to the Beijing East Railway Station Shipping Department

    To the Editor:
    A few days ago, a comrade and I went to Beijing East Railway Station to take the 10:00 AM Beijing-Shenyang train to Tianjin. Because we were carrying more than ten kilograms of public funds, we went to the parcel shipping department to ship it. We first obtained a self-service shipping form from window number four at the shipping department, filled it out, had it stamped by the tax bureau, and weighed it, then went to window number three to pay. The comrade at window number three ignored me and only collected receipts for the 11:40 AM train to Taiyuan. I told him several times, "It's 9:55 AM now, and the train is about to leave." But he still ignored me, saying, "None of my business!" I had no choice but to let that comrade take the money onto the train first. By the time I finished paying and got the self-service ticket, the train had already passed Chongwenmen. In the afternoon, that comrade telegraphed from Tianjin saying, "Tianjin station charged 23,000+ yuan for a 20-kilogram self-service ticket, plus double the fine." Thus, including the payment made at the Beijing station, it totaled more than 60,000 yuan, and I also lost a train ticket. I hope that the Ministry of Railways and the Railway Bureau will change the procedures at the Beijing East Railway Station shipping department. It would be best to prioritize the train that is leaving first and collect parcels that will be shipped on that train first. Furthermore, the cashier should strengthen their work and save time to avoid causing unnecessary losses to passengers.

### 改进包裹托运手续  范范五君向京东站托运处提意见

　　改进包裹托运手续
    范范五君向京东站托运处提意见编辑同志：
    前几天我和一位同志到北京东站乘上午十时的京沈车赴津，因身带公款超过十公斤，便到包裹托运处托运。先向托运处四号窗台领了自理托运单，填毕并经税局盖章、过磅后，便到三号窗台交款。三号窗台的那位同志却不理我，只收十一时四十分开往太原的托运收据。我几次告他“现在九时五十五分了，要开车。”而他还是不理，反说：“管不着！”我没有办法，只好先让那位同志带款上车。等我交完款自理票到手时，车已开过崇文门了。下午我那位同志由津来电说：“津站补自理票二十公斤，两万三千多元，再加一倍罚金。”这样，连京站所缴的款，就是三个两万多元了，还损失了一张车票。我希望铁道部及路局把北京东站托运处的手续改变一下，最好那次列车先开，先收那次列车运走的包裹。再者，收款员要加强工作，争取时间，以免造成乘客不必要的损失。
