Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Beijing is vigorously developing spare-time education for workers and worker-peasant cadres. According to statistics, the city has now established 26 spare-time schools, with a total of 20,523 students, of whom workers account for more than three-quarters.

　　The main purpose of spare-time schools is to improve the cultural level of industrial workers and cadres of worker-peasant origin. The content of study is mainly cultural subjects. At present, it is divided into two levels: primary (equivalent to elementary school) and intermediate (equivalent to junior high school). The primary level is stipulated as a three-year system, with three semesters a year and six hours of classes per week, with courses in Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge; the intermediate level has two types, a three-year system and a four-year system, with two semesters a year. The three-year system has ten hours of classes per week, and the four-year system has six hours of classes per week, with courses in Chinese, mathematics, botany (including physiology and hygiene), physics and chemistry, history, geography, and other subjects. Students are divided into classes according to their different levels in various subjects after passing the entrance examination; graduates who pass the examination are issued graduation certificates equivalent to the level of elementary school or ordinary junior high school.

　　Beijing's formal spare-time schools were established in accordance with the resolution of the Beijing People's Representative Conference in November last year. The Beijing Municipal People's Government has allocated a special fund of 2.85 million jin of millet as funding for spare-time education. The Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Party Committee attach great importance to this work. The Municipal People's Government has also invited the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Municipal Education Workers' Union and other groups to form a spare-time education working committee to unify leadership. The organization of schools is established according to factories, institutions or administrative regions. In spare-time schools based on factories, the Communist Party branch, factory administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League organize the school affairs committee, and the trade union's culture and education department is responsible for actual leadership, and the principal is concurrently held by the administrative负责人. All factories have made reasonable arrangements for spare-time study time to ensure that work and study do not interfere with each other.

　　The textbooks for spare-time schools are compiled and printed by the Spare-Time Education Working Committee in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for primary classes; the textbooks used in ordinary middle schools are temporarily used for intermediate classes. In terms of teachers, in addition to hiring full-time teachers to teach, part-time teachers are selected and hired from among factory staff and institutional cadres.

　　Since the start of school, the students have been in high spirits to learn. Some workers are reluctant to go home after class because they have not finished their homework. The teachers are also active and responsible, and help the workers organize extracurricular assignments in their spare time. The teachers of the spare-time school of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also participated in the democratic management of the plant.

　　At the beginning of the school year, some shortcomings occurred due to insufficient in-depth investigation and research by the leadership: The first was the difficulty in grading and class placement. Individual schools did not take into account the students' study time and location, and did not accurately notify the students of the start date, so that the schools were somewhat chaotic at the beginning of the school year due to the uneven level of students; during the class placement examination, the students' complex level was not accurately measured, so that after the start of school, many students requested a re-adjustment of classes. Secondly, the level of teachers is also uneven. Although many are relatively experienced in teaching, they are very unfamiliar with adult spare-time education, and their general political level is also very low, so they often encounter many difficulties in teaching. In addition, in terms of textbooks, there are also many shortcomings due to the hasty writing time. In response to these shortcomings, the Spare-Time Education Working Committee, in addition to urging the schools to organize teachers to conduct political and professional studies, will also plan to strengthen inspection and guidance to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation and provide specific guidance.

　　京市大力开办业余学校
    现有二十六校学生二万余人中工人占四分之三
    【新华社廿二日讯】北京市大力开展工人和工农干部的业余教育。据统计全市现已建立了业余学校二十六所，学生总数为二万零五百二十三人，其中工人约占四分之三以上。
    业余学校主要是以提高产业工人和工农出身的机关工作人员的文化水平为目的。学习内容以文化课为主。目前分为初级（相当于小学）和中级（相当于初中）两种。初级规定为三年制，一年分三个学期，每周上课六小时，课程有国文、算术、常识三科；中级有三年制和四年制两种，一年分两学期，三年制每周上课十小时，四年制每周上课六小时，课程有国文、数学、博物（包括生理卫生）、理化、历史、地理等科。学生经过入学考试，按各种学科及学生不同的程度分班；毕业时，经过考试及格者，分别发给相当于小学或普通初中程度的毕业证书。
    京市正规的业余学校，是根据去年十一月北京市各界人民代表会议的决议而建立的。北京市人民政府特拨专款二百八十五万斤小米作为业余教育的经费。京市人民政府和中共市委对这一工作都非常重视。市人民政府并邀集市总工会、青年团市工委、市妇联、市教育工作者工会等团体组成业余教育工作委员会，以统一领导。学校的组织是按照工厂、机关为单位或按行政地区设立的。在以工厂为单位的业余学校，由中共支部、工厂行政、工会、青年团组织校务委员会，工会文教部则负责实际领导，校长由行政负责人兼任。各厂都将业余学习时间作了合理的分配，保证了工作学习互不妨碍。
    业余学校的教材，初级课本由业余教育工作委员会会同教育部和全国总工会编印；中级暂时采用普通中学用的课本。师资方面，除请专任教员担任讲授外，并在各厂职员和机关干部中选聘兼任教员。
    各校自开学以来，学员的学习情绪都很高。有的工人因为功课没有作完，下课以后还不肯回家。教员们也都积极负责，课外时间并协助工人组织课外作业。石景山钢铁厂业余学校的教员并参加了该厂的民主管理工作。
    各校在开课之初，由于领导上事先调查研究工作不够深入，曾发生一些缺点：首先是在编级、编班工作上遇到困难。个别学校因为没有照顾到学生学习的时间、地点并确切通知学员开学日期，以致各校在开课的初期，因为学生程度不齐，学习秩序有些混乱；在编班考试时，没有完全准确地测定学生的复杂程度，以致到开学以后，还有不少学生要求重新调整班次。其次，教员的程度也不齐，虽有很多是比较有教学经验的，但对成人的业余教育都很生疏，并且一般的政治水平也很低，因此他们在教学上就常碰到许多困难。此外，在课本方面，因编写时间仓促，也有很多的缺点。业余教育工作委员会针对这些缺点，除督促各校组织教员进行政治和业务的学习外，并将有计划地加强视导工作，以深入了解情况，进行具体指导。
