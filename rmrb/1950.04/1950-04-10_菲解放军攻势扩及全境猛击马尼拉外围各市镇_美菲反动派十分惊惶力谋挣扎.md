Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on April 8th: Newspaper reports indicate that the Philippine national liberation movement has recently erupted with even greater strength. According to a Manila-based correspondent for the *New York Times*, the activities of the Philippine People's Liberation Army (PLA), which last year were limited to only a part of Luzon Island, are now unfolding throughout the entire Philippine archipelago, even extending to islands such as Cebu, Panay, and Negros. The PLA has recently launched numerous fierce attacks on the towns surrounding Manila—Muntarbán, San Mateo, Los Baños, Calamba, as well as Tayabas, San Pablo, and Mabalacat. According to the correspondent's report, the People's Liberation Army numbers nearly 30,000 and possesses ample modern weaponry, including mortars and light artillery. Representatives from the Philippine Department of National Defense recently went to Tokyo to confer with MacArthur on methods to combat the strengthened People's Liberation Army. The United States has allocated fifty Mustang fighter planes to the Philippines. After conferring with General Anderson, head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group, Philippine President Quirino decided to have the Philippine Army replace the police in carrying out the struggle against the Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The offensive of the Philippine People's Liberation Army continues to expand. According to Agence France-Presse, Manila: Quirino and his cabinet received intelligence from the army on the 5th that the Liberation Army's offensive had swept across twenty provinces and two special cities. The Liberation Army in central Luzon has entered the north. According to a United Press report citing information received by the Philippine Constabulary on the 4th: 500 Liberation Army soldiers attacked Aparri on the north coast of Luzon.

The U.S. and Philippine reactionaries are extremely alarmed by the offensive of the Philippine People's Liberation Army. According to a report from the Kuomintang's Central News Agency: Quirino's current residence in Baguio, the capital Manila, and the important U.S. military base Clark Air Base have all taken "precautionary measures" for fear of an attack by the Liberation Army. Many places in Baguio are deploying double sentries, and Manila is "filled with a war atmosphere." The U.S. military at Clark Air Base is on "special emergency alert" all day long and is prepared to "kill anyone to protect American lives and property within the base." In order to salvage its precarious fate, the Quirino government is planning to conscript a large number of university students to fight. Quirino has also issued suppression orders within his not-so-solid ruling clique. According to a United Press report from Baguio on the 7th: Quirino instructed Constabulary Commander Ramos that any governor who does not cooperate with the armed forces will be subject to "severe punishment," and "any governor or mayor who sympathizes with the Hukbalahap (i.e., the Liberation Army) will be "immediately replaced."

Anderson, head of the U.S. "Military Advisory Group" in the Philippines, who actively supports the Quirino government in waging war against the Philippine people, has been replaced by the U.S. government in the face of repeated defeats of the Philippine government forces. According to a dispatch from the United States Information Service in Washington on the 6th: The successor is Major General Hobbs, former commander of the U.S. Ninth Army Corps in Japan.

　　菲解放军攻势扩及全境猛击马尼拉外围各市镇
    美菲反动派十分惊惶力谋挣扎
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约八日讯：报纸消息，菲律宾民族解放运动，近以更为壮大的力量爆发起来。据《纽约时报》驻马尼拉记者报道，菲人民解放军的活动，去年还仅限于吕宋岛的一部分，而现在却在全部菲律宾群岛展开活动，甚至扩展到宿雾、班乃和内革罗等岛。解放军最近又在马尼拉的外围市镇——芒塔尔班，圣·马提阿，洛斯班鸠斯，卡兰巴以及塔奥安，圣·巴布洛和马巴拉卡特作多次猛烈的攻击。根据该记者的报道，人民解放军人数已近三万人，并拥有充分的现代化武器，包括迫击炮和轻型炮。菲律宾国防部代表最近曾去东京和麦克阿瑟商议对壮大了的人民解放军作战的方法。美国已将五十架野马式战斗机拨给菲律宾。菲律宾总统季里诺日前和美国联合军事顾问团团长安德逊将军会商以后，决定以菲律宾陆军代替警察来担任反解放军的斗争。
    【新华社九日讯】菲律宾人民解放军的攻势继续扩大中。据法新社马尼拉讯：季里诺及其内阁五日接获陆军方面的情报称：解放军的攻势已席卷二十个省和两个特别市。吕宋中部的解放军已进入北部。据合众社引菲警备队四日接获的消息称：解放军五百名进攻吕宋北岸的阿巴利。
    美、菲反动派对菲人民解放军的进攻，十分惊惶。据国民党中央社消息：季里诺现在所住的碧瑶、首都马尼拉和美国的重要军事基地克拉克飞机场均已作“事先的防范”，唯恐解放军进击。碧瑶许多地方正布着双哨，马尼拉“充满了战争气氛”。克拉克基地的美军，整天都处在“特别紧急戒备状态”，并准备“格杀任何人，以保障基地以内的美国生命财产”。季里诺政府为了挽救其危急的命运，正计划征召大量大学生作战。季里诺对其并不巩固的统治集团内部，也发布了镇压的命令。据合众社碧瑶七日讯：季里诺指令警备队司令拉莫斯称：任何对武装部队不合作的省长，都将受“严厉处分”，“任何省长或市长同情民抗军（按即解放军）”，“立即撤换”。
    积极支持季里诺政府进行反对菲律宾人民的战争的美国驻菲“军事顾问团”团长安德逊，在菲政府军一再败挫的情势下，已被美国政府撤换。据美国新闻处华盛顿六日电称：继任人选为前美国驻日第九军团长霍布斯少将。
