The First Branch of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 5 Guarantees and Supervises Production Experience
    The General Branch of the Communist Party of China at the Fifth Machine Tool Plant in Shenyang, Branch No. 1, has gained preliminary experience in guaranteeing and supervising production:
        I. The Branch Secretary Goes Deep into the Field to Understand Production Conditions
    Branch Secretary Wang Jinping is often on-site, except when he is in meetings or studying. There is a branch and trade union office on-site. Party members can report situations to him at any time. Wang Jinping also frequently goes to the statistics officer's inspection section, production teams, and groups to understand production conditions through casual conversations. In this way, the branch has a clear understanding of the execution of the production plan.
            II. Relying on Party Members' Reports to Understand Workers' Thoughts and Solve Problems in a Timely Manner.
    In July of last year, Zhao Yongchun (branch committee member), the leader of the Third Production Group, reported: "The outer revolving part (Group 3) has a heavy task, with few machines and a lot of work. Six lathes are needed to complete the plan, but there are only three outer lathes. Comrade Xu Jinglin is the most skilled worker in Group 3; however, Xu Jinglin has ideological concerns. He joined the Kuomintang in the past. He believes this is an indelible stain, so he is not active enough in his work." After clarifying this issue, the branch focused its work on Xu Jinglin. Branch Secretary Wang Jinping often talked with Xu, and group leader Comrade Zhao Yongchun often helped him in his work. Aiming at Xu's ideological concerns, the Party's policies were explained and publicized, and Xu's younger brother (a meritorious worker in Group 1) was mobilized to persuade him to dispel his concerns and concentrate on production. Every bit of his progress was praised promptly. Xu Jinglin thus realized that we do not discriminate against Kuomintang members who confess, and his work gradually became active. Soon, he joined the trade union. His enthusiasm for labor became even higher. He reorganized the labor force and led all the workers in the group to work hard on production. As a result, not only was the plan completed, but the task was exceeded by 25 percent. Afterward, Old Xu was rated as a second-class meritorious worker.
    On one occasion, Party member Ma Hengchang reported to the branch that new records rarely appeared in the Second Lathe Production Group. The branch then went deep into the group to understand the situation and discovered the reason why the group did not create new records. It turned out that they felt the leadership did not value them and did not pay attention to small jobs; at the same time, they believed that small screws could not break any records. Seeing that others had made meritorious contributions and won awards, they became somewhat pessimistic and disappointed. Based on this situation, the branch repeatedly mobilized them, explaining that "small jobs can also break records," and through the trade union, praised and encouraged the advantages of the Second Group on the blackboard newspaper, even if there was a tiny new record, it was praised on the red list. As a result, the Second Group quickly took action and launched a mass movement to create new records, collectively winning a first-class prize banner.
            III. Relying on Workers to Assist Administration in Solving Key Problems in Production in a Timely Manner.
    In October of last year, the milling worker team accepted the task of making spiral mills. The plan was for 1,921 working days, equivalent to 15,369 hours. According to the personnel, machinery, and equipment at that time, the plan would not be completed until January 15th of this year. However, the production plan for the lathe team was to be completed in November. If the milling workers could not complete it until mid-January, there would be a difference of one and a half months between the completion dates of the two departments. The products could not be connected, and 50 out of 110 lathes would have no work to do. This was a serious problem. Cadres above the level of foreman began to worry. Foreman Ding Fuchen put the blueprints in his pocket but had no solution and became ill with anxiety. The planning department proposed outsourcing the work. At that time, the situation of the milling worker team was: ① Ten of the 28 workers had joined the Kuomintang in the past, and none were Communist Party members. ② Foreman Ding Fuchen became ill with anxiety. ③ The workers only knew that the plan could not be completed until January 15th, and did not know the details or what the task was. ④ There was a shortage of tools. ⑤ There was a shortage of personnel. Based on the above situation, the branch believed that the key to solving the above problems was to rely on the masses, especially the activists. Therefore, the Party first established a goal among the masses: "We must overcome all difficulties and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule." Subsequently, Branch Secretary Wang Jinping (who was then the political officer of the First Field Supervision Room and the organization committee member of the Fifth Plant Trade Union) cooperated with the director of the First Branch of the Trade Union to convene several group meetings in the name of the trade union and to individually talk with activists to solicit opinions on improving work. Finally, the following decisions were made:
    First, separate the originally mixed vertical milling and spiral milling. Subdivide groups according to individual strengths. For example, those with expertise in gears were assigned to the gear group, and those with expertise in vertical milling were assigned to the vertical milling group. Second, concentrate the scattered spiral milling machines. Change from one technician watching one machine in the past to one technician paired with one apprentice watching three machines. It was also decided to change from one shift to three shifts (three people rotate work, one shift during the day, one shift in the first half of the night, and one shift in the second half of the night. People are idle but the lathe is not idle). In this way, machine efficiency increased ninefold. The shortage of personnel was basically solved, and the difficulties of insufficient machinery and equipment and tools were initially overcome. Third, launch a challenge competition for the entire team: After the challenge competition between the vertical milling group and the gear group was launched, the work of the entire team immediately became tense. The vertical milling group proposed to guarantee the completion of the task by November 15th. The gear group proposed to guarantee completion by the end of November (because their task was heavier). After the branch further mobilized deeply, they all finished half a month ahead of schedule. The vertical milling group resolutely completed it by the end of October. The gear group resolutely completed it by November 15th. The branch used blackboard newspapers and loudspeakers to spread the spirit of the turning workers throughout every corner of the factory. The workers of the team worked even harder. In order to understand the progress of the movement in a timely manner, grasp the workers' ideological sentiments, and closely check and supervise the implementation of the competition conditions of each subgroup, the branch held four subgroup meetings in its spare time. Such as the black and white shift members exchange of views meetings, production review meetings, detailed accounting meetings (detailed calculation of whether it can be completed on time, to what extent should it be done to complete, etc.), solved many problems. For example, in late October, three shifts produced a total of sixty gear rings and twelve eight-foot wheels. After the detailed accounting meeting, it was necessary to reach seventy gear rings and fourteen eight-foot wheels to complete on schedule. After the meeting, seventy gear rings were made, and fifteen eight-foot wheels were made. For example, because the gear group had a heavy task and few people, they were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task on schedule. The branch took the initiative to suggest to the administration to add five apprentices and one technician to the gear group. In this way, in November 15th - in a month and a half, the task of three and a half months was successfully completed.
    The branch found that many people had made meritorious contributions and won awards in the new record movement, but the monthly production tasks were always not completed. Why was this? After investigation and research, it was found that a lot of working hours were wasted on "indirect production time." In December alone, 7318 points of time were wasted on indirect work. Such as diagnosis and sharpening knives, preparing tools, receiving materials, straightening materials, clamping work, meetings, etc. during production, which were completely counted as the factory's "indirect production time" and not included in the quota. As a worker in Group 3 said: "Except for the time when the knife starts cutting, which is calculated as the worker's quota time, the other sharpening knives, receiving materials, preparing tools, are reported as indirect work, and the factory's economic accounting is not done! How can there not be many workers who get excess awards, make meritorious contributions, but still have not completed the task?! "Even some workers are assigned less than 208 hours of work per month (monthly standard production time). For example, a worker in Group 1 was assigned only 150 points of work in one month. At the end of the month, he got a lot of excess awards. If calculated according to 208 points, the task has not yet been completed. The branch first discovered the seriousness of this problem. Immediately called on the whole factory to pay attention to effectively solve this problem. And called on Party and Youth League members to take the lead in guaranteeing the elimination of wasted working hours. The trade union also issued the slogan of eliminating indirect work. The branch also suggested that the administration decided on the following issues: 1. Everyone should be assigned at least 208 points of work per month. Mobilize workers to ask for tasks themselves, and get more for more work. Now at least 250 points or more are automatically requested in the lathe workers Group 3. 2. Party, government, trade union and Youth League cadres are not allowed to find workers for meetings or talks during production time. If there is something to be notified in advance to do it in spare time (special circumstances excepted). 3. No matter which department, anyone who finds someone during production time must go through the administrative director of the field room and be allowed before going. Otherwise, it will be treated as absenteeism. 4. Change the previous waste of technicians cutting and receiving materials themselves and making the lathe idle. Material cutting, receiving and all the odd jobs are completely the responsibility of the apprentices. After everyone's joint efforts to implement these effective measures, wasted working hours have been greatly reduced. In January, 3691 points were reduced. Equivalent to more than 50 percent of the total wasted working hours in the past.
            IV. Grasp the Key Points and Change Backwardness
    The lathe workers' first and third production groups in the plant have the best beds, which are all motor lathes. There are also many old technical workers. The amount of production and the quality of the fifth plant are determined by these two groups. Therefore, the focus of the branch's work is placed on Groups 1 and 3, and these two key points are broken through in a planned manner. In June last year, after Group 1 (ie, the Ma Hengchang Group) was rated as a model group, the branch seized this banner and mobilized Group 3 to challenge them. However, due to factionalism in Group 3, those with factionalism were rated at 190 points for wages, and general workers were rated at 145 points. Workers were uneasy and wanted to jump to other factories. In response to this situation, the branch suggested that the administration transfer the group leader and other backward workers of the group, and transfer five activists, such as Zhao Yongchun, to reorganize the force and encourage them to challenge Group 1. As a result, the production outlook of Group 3 has greatly changed, from backward to advanced, and is now not much different from Group 1 (model group). In the new record movement, 14 out of 15 workers in Group 3 have made meritorious contributions.
    In short, the branch has grasped the following principles: 1. Rely on Party members, activists, and all workers. 2. Go deep into the grassroots to help one person and one group solve problems specifically. 3. Timely publicity, mobilization, and commendation. Therefore, it can understand the situation in a timely manner and solve specific difficulties in production. The result of doing so not only does not affect the development of Party members and the education of Party members, but on the contrary makes these tasks more specific and easier to carry out. The branch developed 41 Party members in December, accounting for more than 17 percent of the number of employees at that time.

### 沈阳机器五厂第一支部保证与监督生产的经验

　　沈阳机器五厂第一支部保证与监督生产的经验
    中共沈阳第五机器厂总支第一支部，在保证与监督生产方面取得了初步经验：
        一、支书深入现场了解生产情况
    第一支部书记王金平除了开会学习外，经常都在现场。在现场设有支部及工会办公室。党员可以随时到他那里反映情况。王金平也经常到统计员检查股、生产班、小组里以闲谈方式了解生产情形。这样支部对生产计划的执行情况就心里有数了。
            二、依靠党员汇报，了解工人思想，及时解决问题。
    去年七月，第三生产小组组长赵永春（支委）汇报：“外旋部分（三组）任务繁重，机器少活多，必须六台床子才能完成计划，但是仅有三台外车床。徐景林工友在三组是技术最高的，然而徐景林思想上有顾虑。他过去加入过国民党。他认为这是洗不清的污点，所以工作不够积极。支部弄清这个问题后，便把该组的工作重点放在徐景林身上。支部书记王金平经常和徐谈话，小组长赵永春同志在工作中经常帮助他。针对徐的思想顾虑，宣传解释我党政策，并动员了徐的弟弟（一组功臣）劝他打消顾虑，安心生产。又及时表扬了他每一点的进步。徐景林从此体会到了我们对坦白的国民党员并不歧视，工作便逐渐积极起来。不久又加入了工会。他的劳动热情便更加高涨。他重新组织了劳动力，并带动全组工友努力生产，结果不但完成计划，并且超过任务百分之二十五。事后老徐被评为二等功臣。
    有一次，党员马恒昌同志向支部汇报：第二车工生产小组新纪录出现很少。支部便深入该组了解情况，发现了该组没有创造新纪录的原因。原来他们认为领导上不重视他们，不注意小活；同时认为小螺丝也没法创纪录；看见人家都立功得奖了，他们便有些悲观失望。根据这种情况，支部对他们反复动员，解释说“小活也同样能创纪录”，并通过工会在黑板报上表扬鼓励第二小组的优点，那怕有一点一滴的新纪录，也表扬在红榜上。结果，二组很快地动起来了，展开了群众性创造新纪录运动，集体荣获一等奖旗。
            三、依靠工人协助行政及时解决生产中的关键问题
    去年十月，铣工班接受了作螺旋铣的任务。计划是一千九百二十一个工，折合一万五千三百六十九小时。按当时人员机器设备，计划需要到今年一月十五日才能完成。但车工班生产计划是十一月完成。如果铣工在一月中旬才能完成的话，两部门完成日期相差一个半月，产品连接不上，一百一十台车床中，将有五十台车床没有活做。这是个严重问题。工长以上的干部都发起愁来。工长丁福臣将图纸放在自己兜内，毫无办法，急病了。计划科提出要到外面去包活做。当时铣工班的情况是：①二十八名工友中有十名过去加入过国民党，没有一个是共产党员。②工长丁福臣急病了。③工友仅知道计划一月十五日才能完成，不知道详细情况和任务是个啥。④工具不足。⑤人员不够。支部根据以上情况，认为解决以上问题的关键则是依靠群众，特别是积极分子。于是党首先在群众中树立起：“我们要战胜一切困难，为提前完成任务而努力”的奋斗目标。继之支部书记王金平（当时是第一场监委室的政治干事，兼五厂工会组织委员）协同工会第一支会主任以工会名义召开全组会议讨论数次，并和积极分子个别谈话征求改进工作的意见。最后作出以下决定：
    一、将原先混淆的立铣、螺旋旋分开。按个人的特长编分小组。如齿轮特长即编齿轮组，立铣特长即编立铣组。二、将分散的螺旋铣床集中起来。由过去一个技工看一台床子，改变成一个技工配一徒工看三台。并且决定把一班倒改变三班倒（三个人轮换工作，白天一班，前半夜一班，后半夜一班，人闲车床不闲）。这样机器效能增加九倍。基本解决了人员不足的问题，并初步克服了机器设备、工具不足的困难。三、发动全班挑战竞赛：立铣组和齿轮组竞赛展开后，全组工作立时紧张起来。立铣组提出要保证在十一月十五日完成任务。齿轮组提出保证在十一月底完成（因他们任务较重）。经过支部更进一步深入动员，又都提前半个月。立铣组坚决在十月底完成。齿轮组坚决在十一月十五日完成。支部利用黑板报扩音机把旋工班的精神传遍了工厂每个角落，该班工友干的更起劲了。支部为了及时了解运动情况，掌握工人思想情绪，抓紧检查督促各分小组竞赛条件执行情形，在业余时召开了四次小组会议。如黑白班团员交换意见会，生产检讨会，算细账会（细算究竟是否能按期完成，应当做到什么程度才能完成等），解决了不少问题。如在十月下旬三班倒，一共出六十个牙轮，十二个八英尺轮。经过算细账会，必须要达到七十个牙轮，十四个八英尺轮才能如期完成。会后就做到七十个牙轮，八英尺轮则做到十五个。又如由于齿轮组任务重，人又少，恐怕他们如期完不成任务。支部便主动向行政建议增添五名徒工，一名技工到齿轮组。这样在十一月十五日——一个半月期间，胜利完成了三个半月的任务。
    支部发现在新纪录运动中立功得奖的很多，但是每月的生产任务总是拖个尾巴完不成。这是为什么？经过调查研究发现浪费工时的“间接生产时间”很多。在十二月中就有七千三百一十八点的时间是浪费在间接工上。如在生产中诊疗磨刀、准备工具、领料、直料、卡活、开会等等，完全算厂方的“间接生产时间”而不算在定额内。正如三组一工友说：“除了一动刀开始切削时间算工人的定额时间外，另外磨刀、领料、准备工具，都报间接工，也不给厂里的经济核算一下！怎能不发生很多工人得了超额奖、立了功，可是还没完成任务的现象？！‘甚至有的工友每月所分配的任务尚不足二○八小时（每月生产标准时间）。如一组一工友，有一个月只分配了一五○点任务。到月底得了很多超额奖。若按二○八点计算则还未完成任务。支部首先发现了这个问题的严重。随即号召全场注意切实解决这一问题。并号召党、团员要带头保证消灭浪费工时。工会也发出消灭间接工的口号。支部并建议行政决定了下面几个问题：一、每个人每月分配的任务起码要达到二○八点。发动工人们自己要任务，多劳多得。现在车工三组至少都自动要二五○点以上。二、党政工青干部在生产时间不准找工人开会或谈话。如有事预先通知在业余时间办（特殊情形例外）。三、无论任何部门，在生产时间内找人，均要通过场房行政主任，经允许后才可去。否则以旷工处理。四、改变以前技工自己断料领料而使床子闲着的浪费。领料断料及一切零活，完全由徒工负责去作。经过大家共同努力执行这些有效措施，浪费工时大大减少了。一月份减少了三千六百九十一点。相当于过去总浪费工时百分之五十强。
            四、掌握重点，改变落后
    该场的车工第一、三生产小组，床子最好都是马达车床。老技术工人也比较多。五厂生产的数量多少质量好坏，这两组都起决定作用。因之支部的工作重点便放在一、三组上，有计划地突破这两个重点。去年六月间，一组（即马恒昌小组）被评为模范小组后，支部抓紧这面旗帜，发动三组和他们挑战竞赛。但由于三组闹宗派，评工薪时有宗派的都是一九○分，一般工人一四五分。工人情绪不安，想跳厂子。支部针对这种情况便建议行政调换了该小组长及其他落后工友，另将积极分子赵永春等五名调进去，从新组织了力量，鼓动他们与一组挑战竞赛。结果三组生产面貌大大改变，由落后到先进，现在和一组（模范小组）不差上下了。在新纪录运动中，三组十五名工友中有十四名立了功。
    总之，该支部掌握住了以下几个原则：一、依靠党员积极分子及全体工友。二、深入下层具体帮助一个人一个组解决问题。三、及时的宣传鼓动表扬。因之能及时了解情况并解决生产中的具体困难。这样做的结果，不但对发展党员，教育党员没有影响，相反地使这些工作更具体更容易进行。该支部在十二月份中发展了四十一名党员。占当时职工人数的百分之十七强。
