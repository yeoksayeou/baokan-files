[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Public Bus Company has achieved initial success in piloting collective contracts with some bus routes and repair shops. Work efficiency has increased, costs have decreased, and it has prompted the company's administration to recognize the urgent need to establish a quota system.

The collective contract for the Sixth Route (formerly the Guangci Line, now abolished), based on a package responsibility system for drivers and conductors, has been implemented since February 1st. The workers on the route have enhanced their sense of ownership, cooperating, caring for the vehicles, overcoming difficulties, and reducing traffic accidents and breakdowns. They can also accurately control travel time and shorten travel intervals. In February, the interval was reduced from the original 9 minutes and 14 seconds to 7 minutes and 33 seconds. At the same time, the company's income increased and expenses decreased. Comparing the Sixth Route's performance in February with that of January, the total mileage driven increased by 20.9%, the number of passengers increased by 49.8%, and the ticket revenue increased by 54.9%. On the expenditure side, fuel consumption in February decreased by 27.4% compared to January. Looking at the results for March, the Sixth Route's revenue per kilometer was 1.871 jin of millet, which is 0.352 jin of millet more than the average revenue per kilometer for all routes.

The collective contract with some workers in the repair shop was piloted to smoothly complete the conversion of charcoal stoves to wood stoves, and to use wood as fuel to reduce costs. This contract was temporary, with fifteen workers signing the contract, guaranteeing to complete the task of converting five stoves with two hundred and five work days, ensuring good quality, no rework, and no waste of materials. The administration guaranteed timely supply of materials and formulated reward measures for completing the task ahead of schedule. After the contract was implemented on March 21, it took only one hundred and sixty and a half work days to complete the task in ten days, saving 21.7% of labor, and the quality was very good.

The success of these two trial contracts has driven all the workers in the factory to correctly understand the necessity of signing collective contracts, and they unanimously believe that "signing a contract gives us a goal to strive for, and we have a clear direction in our minds." The company is absorbing these two experiences and promoting them to all routes and the entire repair shop to generally sign collective contracts. Production competitions will also be launched based on the contracts. The workers on the Second and Fifth Routes have already matured their plans and will soon sign contracts.

The company's trial signing of these two collective contracts has been basically successful, but there are still some shortcomings, mainly that the contract lacks specific provisions. For example, the administration guarantees the supply of raw materials and tools, but it is not clear how much is supplied; the workers guarantee the good quality of the converted stoves, but the required specifications are not specified, making it difficult to clarify the responsibilities of the administration and the workers. Another example is that the standard for calculating the completion of the task has not been accurately determined, especially the over-work reward. For example, the fifteen workers in the repair shop who completed the stove conversion ahead of schedule were rewarded a total of 217 jin of millet by the administration, but there was no specific distribution method, so the workers had to discuss and allocate it at their discretion. The basic reason for all these problems is that the company lacks a quota standard. From the experience of these two contracts, the company's administration has realized the urgent need to establish accurate quota standards for the work of various departments. With quota standards, collective contracts can play a greater role.

### 京公共汽车公司  试订集体合同制度  效率提高成本降低

    试订集体合同制度  效率提高成本降低
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市公共汽车公司试订部分车路和修理厂的集体合同，获得初步成绩，工作效率提高，成本降低，并促使该公司行政上认识到树立定额制的迫切需要。
    该公司试订的第六路（原广磁线，现已撤销）包乘制集体合同，自二月一日起实行后，车路工人首先增强了主人翁的感觉，互助合作，爱护车辆，克服困难，减少了行车事故，减少了抛锚次数，并且能准确掌握行车时间，缩短行车间隔，二月份即由原来九分钟十四秒的间隔降低到七分钟三十三秒。同时，公司收入增多，开支减少。第六路的二月份成绩和一月份比较，全月行车里数增加百分之二十点九，乘客人数增加百分之四十九点八，因而票款收入增加了百分之五十四点九；开支方面，燃料消耗二月份比一月减少百分之二十七点四。就三月份成绩看，第六路行车每公里的收入折米一点八七一斤，比各路平均每公里收入多零点三五二斤小米。
    试订修理厂一部分工人的集体合同，是为了顺利完成改装木炭炉为木柴炉，燃料改用木柴以减低成本。这次合同是临时性的，订合同的有十五名工人，保证以二百零五个工完成改装五部炉子的任务，并且要质量好，不反工，不浪费材料。行政上保证材料供应及时，并订出提前完成任务的奖励办法。三月二十一日实行合同后，十天工夫只用了一百六十零半个工完成任务，节省人工百分之二十一点七，而且品质很好。
    这两次试订合同的成绩，已带动了全厂工人正确认识订立集体合同的必要，一致认为：“订了合同就有了努力目标，心里有谱。”该公司正吸取这两次经验，推广到各路和修理厂全厂，普遍订立集体合同。并将根据合同展开生产竞赛。现第二路和第五路车路工人已酝酿成熟，即可签订合同。
    该公司试订这两次集体合同，基本上是成功的，但也还存在一些缺点，主要是合同中缺少具体规定，如行政上保证供给原料工具，但究竟供给多少没有明确规定；工人保证改装炉子质量好，但未规定应有的规格，因而行政上和工人的责任就难以明确。又如计算完成任务的标准也没有精确定出，特别是超工奖励，如这次修理厂十五个工人改装炉子提前完成，行政上共奖励二百十七斤小米，却无具体分配办法，只好由工人自行讨论酌情分配。这一切问题的基本原因是该公司没有定额标准。由这两次订合同的经验中，该公司行政上认识到急需树立各部门工作精确的定额标准，有了定额标准才能使集体合同发挥更大的作用。
