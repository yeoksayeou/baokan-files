　　Overcoming Difficulties Leads to Brightness
    ——The Difficulties and Future of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce
    Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: He Li
  (1) Difficulties Arise Amidst Improvement

    March was a very difficult month for Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. This difficulty may continue for a short period. However, as far as Shanghai is concerned, although difficulties exist on one hand, on the other hand, there are various conditions to overcome these difficulties.

    The most concentrated manifestation of this difficulty is sluggish sales and a lack of funds, leading to the shutdown of some factories and shops. According to the Industry and Commerce Bureau, a total of 1,039 businesses applied for shutdown in March. Among them, 243 were factories and 796 were shops. Among the closed businesses, those dealing in luxury consumer goods were the most numerous, such as tailor shops, clothing companies, silk and cloth, woolens, shoes and hats, restaurants, high-end barbershops, cafes, hotels, dance halls, bathhouses, entertainment venues, and intermediate industries that buy and sell on behalf of customers. The closure of these businesses has little impact on people's lives. What is noteworthy is industry, with textiles and dyeing accounting for the largest proportion, most of which are related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. According to the trend in April, this situation is continuing. Due to the shutdown of factories and shops, a large number of workers have become unemployed. This issue has now become an important issue that the Shanghai leadership and all sectors of the country are paying attention to and are working hard to resolve.

    This phenomenon is not occurring under conditions of rising prices, but under conditions of stable prices. Since January of this year, prices in Shanghai have begun to stabilize. In early March, the government implemented currency withdrawal, and prices in Shanghai fell slightly again. The People's Government's measures to stabilize prices are absolutely necessary, not only benefiting the lives of the majority of workers and ordinary citizens, but also paving the way for future development of production and economic prosperity. However, some industrialists and businessmen who have been accustomed to profiting from inflation for more than a decade hold erroneous views about the People's Government, believing that the Renminbi will be the same as the puppet currency. Therefore, whenever prices fluctuate, they desperately borrow at high interest rates, rush to buy raw materials, hoard goods, and even engage in empty buying and selling to manipulate the market and stir up prices. However, the People's Government's unified financial and economic work has solved the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure and the problem of price stability. This cannot but be a serious blow to speculative activities and certain speculative behaviors of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises.

    When the state banks and trade companies withdrew currency from the market in early March, and taxes and public bonds were successively issued, the circulating funds in the market decreased. In the past, all industrial and commercial households had too much stock. Today, seeing that prices are falling, they will lose money if they do not sell early. As a result, industrialists and businessmen throughout the city competed to sell. The doors of large and small shops on Nanjing Road were plastered with posters such as "Big Sale," "Clearing Stock," and "Selling at a Loss," with prices marked under each item to provide convenience for buyers as much as possible. The more sellers there were, the fewer buyers there were. In the past, when inflation was rampant, ordinary citizens would quickly turn any money they had into real goods. Every household had accumulated a batch of real goods. Since prices are falling, no one is willing to easily take money out of their pockets, so the market is "depressed." Industrialists and businessmen are also experiencing financial difficulties.

    This situation immediately affected the financial industry. Due to the high-interest loans that many private banks and money shops had made in the past, many could not be recovered, with an average of about 30 to 40 percent becoming bad debts. On the other hand, they had to pay depositors relatively high interest rates. And many depositors, due to the tightening of social funds, withdrew their deposits from banks to solve their own needs. Most of Shanghai's private banks had developed during the inflation of the past decade or so, and they did not have much capital themselves, relying on speculation to survive. Now, it is impossible to lend at high interest rates as in the past. Coupled with depositors withdrawing funds and their own large expenses, many small banks have successively closed down. According to statistics, on February 5th, there were still 157 private banks and money shops in Shanghai (excluding joint public-private and foreign-owned). By April 1st, a total of 45 had closed or suspended business (29 banks and 16 money shops). With this wave of failures, private banks did not dare to lend to others, and many depositors switched to depositing in state banks and joint public-private banks. This has created serious difficulties for those industrial and commercial enterprises that have always relied on private bank loans to survive.

  (2) Imperialism and Feudalism are the Main Causes of Difficulties

    The main reason for the difficulties is still the semi-colonial nature of Shanghai's industry and commerce. And now Shanghai is in a situation of enemy blockade and bombing, and the inland new rural areas have not yet implemented land reform and there are disasters.

    Since Shanghai was opened as a commercial port after the Opium War, it has relied on imperialism and its agents, the comprador bourgeoisie, to prosper for more than a century. During the reactionary rule, its economic lifeline was basically controlled by imperialism. Shanghai only has a little light industry. Not only do machines and chemical raw materials have to rely on imperialism, but even the cotton for the yarn weaving industry relies on imperialism. Before liberation, from January to May 1949, foreign cotton accounted for more than 60% of the total cotton used by private yarn factories in Shanghai, and even the rice was foreign rice. Now, we are independent, and sales and raw materials must be solved domestically by ourselves, which cannot but temporarily cause some difficulties. Taking cotton as an example, within eleven months since liberation, thanks to the efforts of various economic departments of the People's Government, the cotton problem has been largely solved, but it cannot be completely solved. It will take three or four years to solve it well, which cannot but affect the cost of cotton yarn. More importantly, sales are not good. Due to the long-term exploitation by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital in China, coupled with the aggressive war launched by Japanese imperialism and the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Kuomintang bandits, the lives and property of the people throughout the country have suffered serious losses. Originally, China's industry was very backward, and productivity was not developing, but even such a weak production could not be digested by the people. Years of inflation have weakened the people's purchasing power on the one hand, and on the other hand, have caused many consumers to store a lot of yarn and cloth long ago as a means of savings and even circulation to resist inflation. Therefore, the need for yarn and cloth is now even less. Under these circumstances, although the 1.4 million spindles of Shanghai's private cotton spinning industry are operating at a insufficient capacity and for a short period of time, the sales of yarn and cloth are still very difficult. In addition, the enemy's blockade and bombing have greatly deepened this difficulty. As a sales market for Shanghai's industrial products, the vast rural areas of Jiangnan have not yet implemented land reform, and the purchasing power of farmers has not yet been liberated. Last year's disaster also weakened the people's purchasing power.

    These conditions have already put Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles in an increasingly difficult position, but under the conditions of a speculative and chaotic market, the Shanghai market still has some false prosperity. Once prices stabilize, the difficulties of many industrial and commercial enterprises are revealed.

　　渡过困难就是光明
    ——上海工商业的困难及其前途
    本报特派记者  贺笠
  （一）好转中出现了困难
    三月，是上海工商界很困难的一月。这个困难还可能继续一个短时期。不过，就上海的情形看来，虽然一方面存在着困难，但另一面，却有克服这些困难的各种条件。
    这个困难最集中的表现，是销路不畅，资金缺乏，以致引起一些工厂商店停工歇业。据工商局的材料，三月份申请停工歇业的共一千零三十九家。其中工厂二四三家，商店七九六家，歇业的商业之中以奢侈消费性的行业为最多。如西服店、服装公司、绸布、呢绒、鞋帽、酒菜、高级理发、咖啡、旅馆、舞厅、沐浴、娱乐场所及代客买卖的中间行业等，这些事业的倒闭与人民生活是无多大影响的。值得注意的是工业，其中以纺织、织染等所占比重最大，大多均与国计民生有关。据四月份的趋势，这种情况尚在继续。由于工厂商店的停工歇业。同时连带地发生了大批工人失业。这一问题现已成为上海领导机关以及全国各界共同注意的一个重要问题，正在努力救济中。
    这种现象不是出现在物价高涨的条件下，而是出现在物价平稳的情况下。今年一月以来，上海的物价就已开始稳定。三月初旬，政府实行通货回笼，上海物价又略有下跌。人民政府这种稳定物价的措施是完全必要的，不仅有利于广大职工和一般市民的生活，也为将来发展生产繁荣经济铺平了道路。但是，十余年来一向习惯于在通货膨胀中猎取暴利的某些工商业者，对于人民政府却抱着错误的看法，以为人民币将同伪法币一样，因此每当物价波动时，他们就拚命地不惜高利拆借，抢购原料，囤积商品，甚至买空卖空，操纵市场，掀动物价。但是人民政府的财经统一工作，解决了财政收支平衡与稳定物价问题。这，对于投机事业及某些正当工商业的投机行为就不能不是严重的打击了。
    当三月上旬国家银行及贸易公司在市场上回笼通货，又加税收公债陆续进行之后，市场上流动资金减少，过去各工商户都是囤货太多，今天眼见物价下跌，如不及早出售就要亏本。于是全市工商业者争相出售，南京路上的大小商店门口，都贴满了“大减价”“清出存货”“亏本贱卖”等招贴，每件货物下面都注明了价钱，尽量给购买者以方便。卖者愈多，买者也就愈少。而一般市民过去在通货膨胀时，腰里有一个钱也要赶快去变买成实物。家家都积存有一批实物。既然物价下跌，钱装在腰包里谁也不肯轻易往外放，于是市场就“萧条”了。工商业家的资金也困难了。
    这种情况立刻影响了金融业方面。由于许多私营银钱业过去放的高利贷，很多都收不回来，平均约有百分之三十到四十成为呆账。另一方面却不得不支付存户相当高的利息。而许多存户由于社会资金紧缩，为解决自己的需要，纷纷向银行提存。上海的大多数私营银行本来都是十余年来通货膨胀中发展起来的，本身原来就没有多少资本，依靠投机为生。现在像过去那样高利拆放已不可能，加上存户提款，自己开销又大，于是许多小银行就陆续倒闭。据统计上海二月五日尚有私营行庄一五七家（不包括公私合营及外商），至四月一日先后倒闭停业的共四十五家（银行二十九家，钱庄十六家）。这种倒风一起，私营银行均不敢向外放款，许多存户都改向国家银行及公私合营银行存款。对于那些一向依靠私营银行借贷过活的工商业，就发生了严重的困难。
  （二）帝国主义与封建主义是困难的主要原因
    困难最主要的原因还是上海工商业的半殖民地性。而现在上海又处在敌人封锁轰炸，与内地新区农村尚未实行土地改革且有灾荒的条件下面。
    上海自鸦片战争开辟为商埠以后，百余年来都是依赖帝国主义及其代理人买办资产阶级而繁荣起来的。在反动统治时期，它的经济命脉基本上是控制在帝国主义手中的。上海只有一点轻工业，不仅机器和化工原料等要依靠帝国主义，连纱织业的棉花也是依赖帝国主义的。在解放前，一九四九年一月至五月，上海私营纱厂所用外棉占总用棉百分之六十以上，连食米也是洋米。现在，我们自主了，销路与原料均要由国内自己来解决，这就不能不暂时产生一些困难。以棉花而论，解放以来十一个月之内，由于人民政府各经济部门的努力，棉花问题已大部解决了，但还不能完全解决，还须有三几年时间才能很好的解决，这就不能不影响棉纱的成本。更重要的是，销路不好。中国由于帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本长期的搜括，再加日本帝国主义所发动的侵略战争及国民党匪帮所发动的反革命内战，使全国人民生命财产受了严重的损失。本来中国的工业就很落后，生产力就不发展，但就这样一点微弱的生产，人民都还消化不了。连年的通货膨胀，一面削弱了人民的购买力，另一面又使很多消费者早已储存了许多纱布作为抵抗通货膨胀的储蓄手段乃至流通手段，因此现在对纱布的需要更见减少。在这种情形下，上海私营棉纺业一百四十余万枚纱锭今天数量虽然开得不足，开的时间虽然很少，纱布的销路仍然很困难。加以敌人的封锁轰炸，更大大地加深了这种困难。作为上海工业品销场的广大江南农村，至今还未实行土地改革，农民的购买力还没有解放出来。去年的灾荒，也削弱了人民的购买力。
    这些条件本已使上海工商业界处于日益困难的地位，但在投机性的混乱市场还继续的条件下，上海市场还有些假繁荣气象，一旦物价稳定，许多工商业的困难都表现出来了。
