　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: According to the South Korean Hapdong News Agency: In order to strengthen its espionage activities on the Asian continent, US imperialism has established a radio station on Heuksan Island, at the southwestern tip of Korea, as an advanced base for directing such activities. The radio station was completed last month and is entirely managed and controlled by Americans. Heuksan Island is located at 34 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, in a strategic position in the Jeju Strait, which is the only way to pass from the Sea of Japan through the Korea Strait to the Yellow Sea.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to TASS quoting Tokyo, MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 13th that the US occupation forces in Japan will train South Korean army officers. Thirty-three officers of Syngman Rhee will arrive in Tokyo on April 15 for three months of training. They will receive "combat training in infantry, artillery, engineers, medical and logistics units of the United States Army."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: Under the direction of its American masters, the South Korean puppet government of Syngman Rhee is now carrying out a conspiracy to recruit Japanese soldiers to participate in the massacre of the Korean people. After Syngman Rhee personally visited Japan in February, he sent his confidant, Cai Bingde, Minister of Armaments Administration of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, to Japan on March 4, under the pretext of "visiting Japanese industry" and "hiring technical personnel," to recruit mercenaries and Japanese military officers. According to the "Hankook" News Agency in Seoul: Cai Bingde returned to Seoul on March 21. He told reporters: "In any case, it is very necessary to hire Japanese 'technical personnel' to South Korea." At the same time, six Korean traitor war criminals, Kim Ok-dong, Zheng Bingkui, Park Byunghan, Lee Kwonjae, Lee Youngbyung, and Kim Doo-sam, who were detained in Sugamo Prison in Japan, were released by MacArthur the day after Syngman Rhee's visit to Japan (February 17) and returned to South Korea at the end of March.

    【新华社平壤十七日电】据南朝鲜合同社讯：美帝国主义为加强其在亚洲大陆的间谍活动，已在朝鲜西南端的小黑山岛上建立了一个无线电台，作为指挥此种活动的前哨据点。该电台已于上月完工，全由美国人管理掌握。小黑山岛位于北纬三十四度、东经一百二十五度处，地当济州海峡要冲，是从日本海通过朝鲜海峡到黄海的必经之路。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社引东京消息，麦克阿瑟总部十三日宣布，美国驻日占领军将训练南朝鲜陆军军官。李承晚的三十三名军官，将于四月十五日抵达东京，受训三个月。他们将受“美国陆军的步兵、炮兵、工兵、医务以及后勤部队的战斗训练”。
    【新华社平壤十七日电】南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府在其美国主子的指使下，现正进行招募日军参加屠杀朝鲜人民的阴谋。李承晚自二月间亲自访日后，又于三月四日派遣其亲信伪国防部兵器行政部部长蔡秉德，以“参观日本工业”和“聘请技术人员”为名，赴日招募雇佣兵和日军将校。据“韩国”通讯社汉城消息：蔡秉德已于三月二十一日返抵汉城。他曾对新闻记者说：“无论如何，聘请日本‘技术人员’来韩国，是很必要的。”与此同时，拘押在日本巢鸭监狱中的鲜奸战犯金沃东、郑秉奎、朴炳汉、李权济、李英炳、金斗叁等六名，在李承晚访日的第二天（二月十七日），即被麦克阿瑟释放，并已于三月底回到南朝鲜。
