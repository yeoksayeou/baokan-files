　　Greeting "May First" Labor Day
   Fengtai Inspection Depot Rushes Production
    [Our Newspaper] The Fengtai Inspection Depot is greeting "May First" Labor Day with enthusiastic and intense production.
    The Eastern Train Inspection Class C workers were the first to take the lead by using their off-duty time to rush repairs on heavily damaged cars as a gift to "May First", driving all train inspection workers to join the movement. After the first locomotive, outside of the entire repair plan, was completed by train inspection comrades who were not repair workers, this locomotive was named "Train Inspection May First". The woodworking shop workers refused to be outdone. They decided to use Sundays and spare time to guarantee the completion of the woodworking production and distribution of two inspection cars before "May First", and issued a friendly challenge to the mechanical, welding, ironworking, warehouse, oil line, and repair departments. The challenge letter from the mechanical field workers guaranteed to complete five tasks in the Red May production competition: (1) Create a tool for disassembling buffers; (2) Transform the wheel lathe; (3) Improve the tile scraping tool; (4) Create a new diamond plate screw disassembler; (5) Create a track measuring device. The ironworkers' response to the veteran workers of each group guaranteed the timely supply of all repair tools and vehicle parts, and that they would meet the standards. All the workers in the braking group guaranteed that the repair time would not be extended due to the B-check, and that the braking work would be done absolutely timely. Each car must be thoroughly and carefully tested, and safe departure and safe operation would be guaranteed. In addition to ensuring the completion of the daily inspection and repair plan, the overhaul group and the A-check group will also rush to repair an A-check car with their spare time before "May First". The women comrades in the oil line room originally had five people, but now only three are left, but they put forward the slogan "Three people do the work of five people", guaranteeing the normal supply of a large number of oil rolls for car repair. The challenge letter from the material section took the lead in the administrative departments. In order to do a good job in the general survey and the inventory work of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, they will use Sundays to sort out materials, fuels, coal, etc., and propose to go to work one hour earlier every day.
