Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 14th: The Southwest region is currently undertaking an extremely arduous transportation task to allocate one billion jin of grain. Among this, 400 million jin will be transported to the disaster areas in East China, and 600 million jin will be distributed to cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Kunming to regulate food supplies and guarantee other expenditures.

　　This grain transportation will utilize waterways and major highways as much as possible. However, due to the mountainous terrain and inconvenient transportation in the Southwest region, some areas will rely on a large amount of manual labor to carry the grain to transportation hubs. For example, transporting 280 million jin of grain in Eastern Sichuan will require 2 million laborers. To ensure the smooth completion of the allocation and transportation work, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee has instructed the Southwest Ministry of Finance Shipping Bureau and the Southwest Military Region Command to jointly form a Grain Transportation Headquarters with the grain receiving personnel from East China to unify the leadership of the grain transportation work. The Grain Transportation Headquarters has now gathered nearly 60 ships, including steamers, landing craft, and iron barges, totaling over 15,700 tons, and 12,000 tons of wooden boats to participate in the transportation. Transfer stations have been set up in Chongqing, Luxian, Wanxian, and other places along the Yangtze River to transport grain eastward to Yichang for unloading. Currently, it is the dry season, and the ship's load capacity is reduced by three-quarters compared to the flood season. The Shipping Bureau is trying to speed up the turnover rate of ships, minimize loading and unloading time, and stipulate that the round trip between Chongqing, Wanxian, and Yichang should not exceed eight days.

　　Currently, 30 million jin of grain have been transported to East China. The Grain Transportation Headquarters is determined to overcome all difficulties and ensure that the task of transporting 400 million jin of grain eastward is completed by the end of September this year at the latest.

　　西南调拨粮食十亿斤
    分别运华东灾区及西南各大城市
    【新华社重庆十四日电】西南区现正大力进行一项极其艰巨的调拨十亿斤粮食的运输工作。其中四亿斤运济华东灾区，六亿斤分运重庆、成都、贵阳、昆明等城市，用以调剂民食及保证其他开支。
    此次粮食运输将尽量利用水路及公路干线进行。但由于西南地区多山，交通不便，部分地区在将粮运至交通线上集中时，将依靠大量人力担运。如川东运粮二亿八千万斤，即需二百万个劳动力。为保证调运工作的顺利完成，西南财政经济委员会已责成西南财政部航运局、西南军区司令部配合华东区粮食接运人员共同组成运粮指挥部，统一领导运粮工作。现运粮指挥部已调集轮船、登陆艇、铁驳船等近六十艘，计一万五千七百余吨，木船一万二千吨参加运输，并在长江沿岸的重庆、泸县、万县等地设立转运站，东运粮食至宜昌卸货。目前正值枯水季节，船只装载量较水涨季节减少达四分之三。航运局正设法加速轮船运转率，尽量缩短装卸时间，并规定重庆、万县两地至宜昌间航行往返一次不超过八天。
    现运往华东粮食已达三千万斤，运粮指挥部决克服一切困难，保证至迟在今年九月底前完成四亿斤粮食东运任务。
