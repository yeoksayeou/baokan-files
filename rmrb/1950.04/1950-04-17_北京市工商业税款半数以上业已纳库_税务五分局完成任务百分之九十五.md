[Beijing News Agency Report] According to statistics from the Municipal Taxation Bureau, the amount of industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949 paid into the treasury during the first payment period in Beijing has reached over 17.58758 billion RMB, accounting for approximately 52.7% of the total tax amount (plus grain certificates convertible to over 147,000 jin of grain). In this collection of industrial and commercial tax, the government, to accommodate the industrial and commercial sectors, stipulated that payments be made in two installments: the first from April 1st to 15th, and the second from April 16th to 30th. Each industrial and commercial entity should pay at least half of the tax amount during the first period. As a result of consultations between the various tax bureaus and the industrial and commercial entities, the majority of industrial and commercial entities enthusiastically completed the first installment payment; many have already paid the entire amount. However, a considerable number of entities had not paid half of the tax amount by the deadline of April 15th for the first installment. The Municipal Taxation Bureau has decided to impose late payment fees according to the original regulations.

[Further News] As of April 15th, the percentages of tax revenue paid into the treasury by each tax bureau, in relation to the amount due from industrial and commercial entities within their respective jurisdictions, are as follows: First Tax Bureau, 72%; Second Tax Bureau, 51%; Third Tax Bureau, 41%; Fourth Tax Bureau, 47%; Fifth Tax Bureau, 95%; Sixth Tax Bureau, 72%; Seventh Tax Bureau, 41%; Eighth Tax Bureau, 65%.

　　北京市工商业税款半数以上业已纳库
    税务五分局完成任务百分之九十五
    【京市新闻处讯】据市税务局统计，京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税在第一期缴款期间纳库数字已达人民券一百七十五亿八千七百五十八万余元，约占此次全部税款的百分之五十二点七（另有折米券折米十四万七千余斤）。此次征收工商业税，政府为照顾工商业者起见，规定分两期缴款第一期自四月一日至十五日，第二期自十六日至三十日；各工商业户在第一期内至少应缴纳税款一半。由于各税务分局与工商业者进行协商的结果，一般工商业者都踊跃完成了第一期的缴纳任务，且有很多户已经全部缴清；但也有不少户到十五日第一期缴款截止时，并未缴纳一半税款，市税务局决根据原定办法，处罚滞纳金。
    【又讯】京市各税务分局到十五日止已纳库税款占各该分局界内工商业者应纳库数字的百分比如下：税务第一分局占百分之七十二，二分局占百分之五十一，三分局占百分之四十一，四分局占百分之四十七，五分局占百分之九十五，六分局占百分之七十二，七分局占百分之四十一，八分局占百分之六十五。
