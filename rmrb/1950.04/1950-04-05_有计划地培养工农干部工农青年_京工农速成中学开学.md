    Beijing Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School Opens

    The "Beijing Experimental Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School," jointly established by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, held its opening ceremony today after more than two months of preparation. Those present at the ceremony included Minister of Education Ma Xulun, Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Wei Que, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Education Liu Aifeng, Deputy Director Ge Zhicheng, Director of the Secondary Education Department Lin Liru, Deputy Director Zhang Cuizhong, Deputy Director of the Social Education Department Jiang Ling, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Weng Dujian, Deputy Director Hou Junyan, as well as all faculty and staff, the first group of students, and guests, totaling about 200 people. After a speech by the school's Principal Hu Chaozhi, Minister Ma Xulun gave a speech in which he pointed out that the direction of the Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School is to systematically cultivate worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth, providing them with basic education in middle-level culture and science so that they can pursue advanced studies at universities, serving as the strong backbone for the construction of the new China. The enrollment targets are cadres who have participated in revolutionary struggles for more than three years, have a cultural level equivalent to graduation from senior primary school, are between sixteen and thirty years old, are ideologically progressive, physically healthy, and active in their work, or excellent workers with more than three years of work experience, are between sixteen and twenty-eight years old, have a level equivalent to graduation from senior primary school, are ideologically progressive, active in their work, and physically healthy, with emphasis first placed on industrial workers. The duration of study is tentatively set at three years. The main subjects are Chinese and mathematics, followed by basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, history, politics, geography, and nature. Then come physical education, music, art, and drafting. Russian is offered as an elective foreign language.

    Vice Minister Qian Junrui pointed out in his speech that culture was originally created by the working people, but later it was seized by the exploiting classes as a tool to rule over the working people. Today, the Chinese working people have politically turned over, and economically they have also begun to turn over, and they must also turn over culturally. If the cultural turn-over is not realized, the political and economic turn-over cannot be consolidated. The cultural turn-over means returning culture to the working people, combining it with labor production, so that workers and peasants can master culture, master theory, and strengthen the struggle and construction work. He called on the students to study hard, enter universities in the future, and after graduation, become the most loyal intellectuals of the working class and the peasant class, serving the workers and peasants for life. Subsequently, Vice Minister Wei Que, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Weng Dujian, and guests gave speeches, unanimously congratulating the establishment of this new type of school and encouraging everyone to work hard for the construction of the new China.

　　有计划地培养工农干部工农青年
    京工农速成中学开学
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府教育部与北京市文教局联合创办的“北京实验工农速成中学”，经过两月余的筹办，并已于今日举行开学典礼。出席典礼者有中央教育部马叙伦部长，钱俊瑞、韦悫副部长，教育部办公厅刘皑风主任，葛志成副主任，中等教育司林砺儒司长，张萃中副司长，社会教育司江凌副司长，北京市文教局翁独健局长，侯俊岩副局长以及该校全体教职员、第一期学员和来宾等共约二百人。该校校长胡朝芝致词后，即由马叙伦部长讲话，他指出：工农速成中学的方针，是有计划地培养工农干部及工农青年，给以中等文化科学的基本教育，以便升入大学深造，作为新中国建设的坚强骨干。招生对象，是以参加革命斗争三年以上、具有相当高小毕业文化程度、年在十六岁至三十岁、思想进步、身体健康、工作积极的干部，或有三年以上的工龄、年在十六岁至二十八岁、具有相当于高小毕业程度、思想进步、工作积极、身体健康的优秀工人，首先着重产业工人。修业年限暂定三年，主要科目是国文和数学，其次是物理、化学、历史、政治、地理、自然的基本知识，再次是体育、音乐、美术及制图，外国语为选修俄文。
    钱俊瑞副部长在讲话中指出：文化原是劳动人民创造的，后来被剥削阶级夺了去作为统治劳动人民的工具。今天中国劳动人民在政治上翻身了，经济上亦开始翻身，文化上也必须翻身。如果文化上不翻身，则政治、经济上的翻身还不能巩固。文化上翻身是要把文化交还劳动人民，与劳动生产结合，使工农掌握文化、掌握理论，加强斗争和建设工作。他号召学员们努力学习，将来进大学，毕业后做工人阶级和农民阶级的最忠实的知识分子，终身为工农服务。接着由韦悫副部长、北京市文教局翁独健局长及来宾讲话，他们一致庆贺这一新型学校的成立，勖勉大家为新中国的建设而努力学习。
