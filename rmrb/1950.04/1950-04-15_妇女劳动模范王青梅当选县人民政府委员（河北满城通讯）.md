　　Woman Labor Model Wang Qingmei Elected as Member of County People's Government
　　(Hebei Mancheng Communication)
　　Our Correspondent Wang Derui

　　Wang Qingmei, a woman labor model from Xiyuhe Village, Fourth District, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, is a twenty-year-old outstanding female member of the Youth League. She is a representative of the village people's congress and a member of the village women's federation. On March 25th, she was elected as a county representative to the county people's congress and was elected as a member of the county people's government at the county people's congress.

　　There are three people in Wang Qingmei's family: her fifty-year-old mother and her fourteen-year-old younger brother. They cultivate ten and a half mu of land. She is mainly responsible for the affairs inside and outside the home. She can do plowing, sowing, hoeing, and reaping, and she can spin, weave, and transport goods for sale. She has never hired anyone to work in the fields. The villagers all say, "Qingmei is truly worthy of being called a labor hero."

　　When she was twelve years old, her father developed a mental illness and could not do heavy work. He could not plant crops properly, and there was not enough food to eat. They even had to beg for food. Because the family lacked labor, Qingmei began to participate in field labor at the age of thirteen. Whether it was going up the mountain to cut grass, pulling a *haozi* (a kind of farming tool for plowing), or hoeing, she learned to do everything and became a good helper to her father. In the autumn of her fifteenth year, she and her father cut grain in the fields during the day and ginned cotton for the villagers at night (to earn manual labor wages). Her father pedaled the ginning machine, and she pedaled the sieve, ginning fifteen to twenty *jin* every night. In the winter, when she worked at night, the sweat soaked her cotton clothes, but she kept pedaling. Wang Zhixue's mother praised her, saying, "This is truly a promising good child!" The money earned from ginning cotton was used to buy cotton, which was spun into thread. In four months, she earned a small donkey and seven hundred *jin* of vegetables.

　　When she was seventeen, her father passed away. At that time, her younger brother was only eleven years old and could not do the work of an adult. All the work depended on Qingmei. Some people in the village saw that Qingmei's father had died and advised her mother to say, "Find Qingmei a husband, and the remaining two people will have an easier time!" But Qingmei said to her mother, "Mom! Don't worry! Women under the leadership of the Communist Party are different from the past. Isn't everyone an individual?! I will definitely work hard to produce in the future." From then on, she worked even harder in production.

　　She is an outstanding expert in the village when it comes to working in the fields. When hoeing, she wears a purple floral dress, covers her head with a towel, and goes barefoot. Every day, she works from early morning until late at night. At night, she also feeds the livestock. When she works, she is no different from a man. She can hoe two *mu* of land in one day for the first hoeing, two and a half *mu* for the second hoeing, and more than three *mu* for the third hoeing. She hoes every crop four times, and the crops grow stronger than others. Every year, she plows the land early after the autumn harvest, leaving no bare land. Last year, she also learned to plow and sow from her uncle. Her neighbors Liu Laizi and Wang Luoqian praised her, saying, "Don't underestimate her just because she's a woman. She takes care of the land so well. She's number one in the whole village."

　　Every year, after the autumn harvest is completed, she and her younger brother go to Xishan, six *li* away from the village, to cut grass very early in the morning, bringing dry food and returning only at night. Last year alone, she cut three thousand *jin* of foreign grass. In addition to using more than a thousand *jin* to feed the livestock, she sold the rest for money to engage in transportation and sales. She transported corn from Yi County to Mancheng market (a distance of more than fifty *li*) to sell, earning more than one *dou* per trip. She transported eggs to Baoding six or seven times, earning a new set of clothes. In order to accumulate more fertilizer and cultivate the land well, she raises a large pig every year. She often says to the villagers, "Without manure, you're just messing around; if you want to eat, don't leave the pigpen empty." Sometimes, she even carries a manure basket when she goes up the mountain to cut grass. Every day, she sweeps the soil in the yard and puts it in the pigpen. In 1947, she accumulated more than a hundred *dan* of fertilizer, in 1948, two hundred *dan*, and last year, nearly three hundred *dan*, fertilizing each *mu* of land with thirty *dan*.

　　Because there is more and more fertilizer in the fields every year, and she cultivates diligently, the harvest is stronger every year. Last year, ten and a half *mu* of land yielded fifteen *shi* of grain, and she also picked two hundred *jin* of cotton and dug up one thousand six hundred *jin* of Chinese yam. In addition to the whole year's consumption, she had a surplus of more than one *shi*; and apart from paying public grain for cotton, she still had a hundred *jin* in storage. In terms of firewood, what she and her brother gathered was enough. Dai Lianjin's mother said, "People's wheat stalks from the year before last are still untouched!" The whole family's life has greatly improved. Her mother happily said to others, "Now I have no difficulty in eating and wearing clothes. This is my daughter's ability!"

　　Last December, the village elected her as a village representative and a labor model to attend the county representative meeting. Later, she honorably joined the Youth League. At the county labor model conference, she happily said, "In the old society, women had no status. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, women's status has improved, and I can also participate in this conference." On March 8th, she was invited to be a representative to attend the provincial conference commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day; on March 25th, she was elected as a county representative to attend the county people's congress; and on April 2nd, she was elected as a member of the county people's government at the county people's congress. After participating in the first county people's government committee meeting to discuss important county affairs, she said, "In the past, how could we be a county representative?! Let alone a government committee member. I feel very honored."

　　Since returning from attending the provincial "March 8th" commemoration meeting, she said to her mother, "I participated in this meeting and understand better that only by actively participating in agricultural and sideline production and improving our culture can we improve the status of women. We must produce well and ensure the completion of the production increase task." She also told the League members about the meeting in the province. Others said, "Qingmei has gained a lot of knowledge from attending the meeting and is much more enlightened than before." Her family also held a family meeting and divided the labor for production: her mother was mainly responsible for cooking, spinning, and feeding pigs; Qingmei was responsible for organizing the work exchange group and working with her younger brother to do a good job in field production, ensuring that cotton was hoed four or five times, grain was hoed four times, corn was hoed three times, and yam was hoed five or six times; she would do careful cultivation to ensure increased production; and at the same time, everyone would ensure that they were thrifty everywhere to achieve prosperity through production. The whole family was energized in production. In order to respond to careful cultivation and timely sowing, she immediately harrowed five *mu* of bare land once and prepared three *mu* of cotton land even better. She planned that if there was no rain when sowing, she would also guarantee to carry water to plant two *mu* (the wells in the village are fifteen *zhang* deep, which is mountainous land). The fertilizer had already been transported, and she personally ginned cotton and selected good cotton seeds. She was just waiting to harrow it again before sowing, and she planned to apply thirty *dan* of topdressing fertilizer per *mu* to five and a half *mu* of wheat. The manure for the three *mu* of land that had not been transported before the new year was now also transported to the fields, and she would spread the green manure as soon as it rained. In her spare time from farming, she also assisted Liu Zhenhua, the director of the women's federation, in mobilizing twenty young women to join the literacy class.

　　Since being elected as a government committee member, her production enthusiasm has been even higher. She plans to convene a village people's congress first after returning to the village, and have the village representatives convey the spirit of the county people's congress resolution to each household so that the masses can understand it. She will call on the masses of the whole village to hoe the wheat once (the village has never had the habit of hoeing wheat), eliminate fire spiders immediately if they occur, select wheat seeds in the fields, and mobilize the masses to quickly harrow the cotton fields and reserve more cotton fields; when planting corn and millet, they should soak the seeds in warm water to prevent diseases. She will first ensure that all the members of her work exchange group (she and Wang Lanshui and other four households have formed a new group) do the above methods, to influence the masses. And through the League members, she will mobilize all the young people to create a mass production movement to complete this year's production increase task.

　　妇女劳动模范王青梅当选县人民政府委员         
   （河北满城通讯）
    本报通讯员  王德瑞
    河北省满城县四区西渝河村妇女劳动模范王青梅，今年二十岁，是一个优秀的女青年团员，是村人民代表大会的代表兼村妇联会委员，于三月二十五日被选为县人民代表大会的县代表，并在县人民代表大会上被选为县人民政府的委员。
    王青梅家中共三口人，有五十岁的母亲和十四岁的小弟弟，种地十亩半。家里家外的事主要都靠着她。耕、耩、锄、?都能干，纺线、织布、运销样样都行。地里的活儿没雇过人。村里人都说：“青梅真称得起劳动英雄”。
    十二岁上父亲得了疯症，不能干重活，庄稼刨种不到，打粮食不够用，曾经要过饭吃。因为家里缺少劳动力，青梅十三岁就参加了田间劳动，无论是上山割草、拉耠子（一种耕田的农具）、锄地，什么活都学着干，从此成了父亲的一个好助手。十五岁那年秋天，和父亲白天下地割谷子，晚上给本村老乡轧花（挣手工），父亲蹬轧车，她蹬筛子，每晚轧十五斤至二十斤。冬天夜里干起活来，出的汗把棉衣湿透了，还蹬个不停。王志学的母亲夸她说：“这才是一个有出息的好孩子呢！”轧花挣的钱买成棉花纺成线，四个月整赚了一个小毛驴和七百斤菜。
    她十七岁时候父亲去世了。那时弟弟才十一岁，不能顶个大人做活，一切活儿都靠着青梅。同村有的人见到青梅的父亲死了，劝她母亲说：“给青梅找个婆家，剩下两口人就好过啦！”可是青梅对母亲说：“娘！你放心！共产党领导下的妇女，跟过去不同啦，谁不是个人呢？！我以后一定努力生产。”从此以后，她对生产更加劲了。
    她在庄稼地里做活，是全村出色的能手。锄地时穿着一身紫花衣裳，头上蒙着条手巾，光着脚，每天都是陪星星伴月亮，起早搭黑的劳作；夜里还要喂牲口，干起活来和男人没有分别。锄头遍茬子一天锄二亩，二遍二亩半，三遍三亩多。每种庄稼都能作到锄四遍，庄稼比别人长的还强。每年秋后早早把地耕出来，不留一亩白茬地。去年跟她大伯又学会了耕地、耩地。地邻刘来子、王洛钱夸她说：“别看是个妇女，地弄的真像个样子，全村就得数第一。”
    每年收清了秋后，每天很早就和弟弟到离村六里的西山去割草，带着干粮，晚上才回来。只去年就割了洋草三千斤，除了喂牲口用一千多斤外，其余的卖了钱搞运销。从易县运玉米到满城集（相距五十多里）去卖，每趟赚一斗多；向保定运了六七趟鸡蛋，赚了一身新衣裳。为了多积肥，把地种好，年年养着一口大猪，她常向老乡们说：“不上粪，瞎胡混；要吃饭，别空圈。”有时上山割草都背着粪筐，每天扫院子的土，都垫在圈里。一九四七年积肥百余?，一九四八年二百?，去年则将近三百?，每亩地上粪三十?。
    因为地里的粪一年比一年多，又耕种的到，所以收成一年比一年强。去年十亩半地打了十五市石粮，还摘了二百斤棉花，刨了一千六百斤山药。除全年吃用外，还余一石多；棉花除缴公粮外，还存一百斤。烧柴上，光和她弟弟拾的就够。戴连进的母亲说：“人家前年的麦子秸现在还没动呢！”全家生活大大提高了。她母亲高兴的对别人说：“如今我吃穿都不困难啦，这是俺闺女的能耐（即本领）换来的！”
    去年十二月，村里选她为出席县代表会的村代表和劳动模范，随后光荣的参加了青年团。在县劳模大会上，她高兴地说：“在旧社会里妇女没地位，共产党领导下的妇女地位提高了，我也能参加这个大会了。”三月八日被聘请为出席省纪念“三八”节大会的代表；三月二十五日被选为出席县人民代表大会的县代表；四月二日在县人民代表大会上又被选为县人民政府的政府委员。她在参加了讨论全县大事的首届县人民政府委员会议之后说：“要是早先，咱们干什么能当个县代表啊？！更不用说政府委员了，我觉得很光荣。”
    自参加省“三八”节纪念会回来，她就对她母亲说：“我参加了这次会，更明白了，只有积极参加农业、副业生产，提高文化，才能提高妇女的地位；咱们要很好生产，一定保证增产任务的完成。”并向团员们讲述在省里开会的事。别人都说：“青梅开会长了不少知识，比早先开通多了。”她家又召开了家庭会议，进行了生产上的分工：母亲主要负责做饭、纺线、喂猪；青梅负责组织拨工组和弟弟把地里的生产搞好，保证棉锄四、五遍，谷锄四遍，玉米三遍，山药五、六遍；作好精耕细作，保证增产；同时每人都保证处处作到节约，达到生产致富。全家生产上都起了劲，为了响应精耕细作和按时播种，自己马上把五亩白地擦耙了一遍，三亩棉地整理的更好。她计划如果临播种时无雨，也保证挑水点种二亩（该村井十五丈深是山地）。肥料早已运齐，并亲自轧花，挑选了好棉籽种，只等到时再耙擦一遍即行播种，并计划五亩半小麦每亩施追肥三十?。年前未运的三亩粪地现在粪也运到地里了，只要落了雨即行泼青（铺粪）。她在耕作余暇，并协助妇联会主任刘振华动员了二十名青年妇女入了午校。
    从被选为政府委员后，她的生产情绪更高涨了，计划回村后，先召开村人民代表大会，由村代表向各户传达，使群众都了解这次县人民代表大会决议的精神，号召全村群众把小麦普遍锄一遍（该村历来就无锄麦习惯），发生火蜘蛛立即消灭，作到田间选麦种，和动员群众把棉田迅速打耙好，多留棉田；在耩玉米、谷子时要作到温汤浸种以防病害。以上办法，首先保证自己拨工组里的人全部做到（她和王兰水等四户新组织了一组），来影响群众。并通过团员把全体青年带动起来，造成群众性的大生产运动，来完成今年的增产任务。
