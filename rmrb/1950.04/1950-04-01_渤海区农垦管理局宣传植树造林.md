　　Bohai District State Farm Bureau Promotes Afforestation
    [This newspaper dispatch] In order to green the countryside, the Bohai District State Farm Bureau is expanding its afforestation and seedling cultivation work this year. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, it has completed spring plowing preparations such as seed and seedling provision. To mobilize the masses to plant trees, the bureau has been conducting extensive publicity in conjunction with local governments before the thaw in each farm. The entire district is expected to plant 200,000 trees.
