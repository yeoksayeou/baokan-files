　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Leadership Conducts Self-Criticism
    Democratic Management Campaign Launched, Determined to Rely on Workers to Run the Factory Well
    [Our Newspaper News] Reporter Yi Bing reports: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is gradually striving to improve various unreasonable systems in accordance with the production policy of "reducing costs and improving quality." In the past three months of September, October, and November, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and other agencies successively inspected the plant and found several serious shortcomings. On March 2nd of this year, this newspaper exposed the plant's leadership for having a style of work characterized by bureaucratism and preoccupation with routine matters, which aroused great attention from the plant's employees. In addition to the plant's military representative, Zhang Fang, and deputy military representative, Guo Ji, having already publicly reviewed their shortcomings (see page one of this newspaper on March 24), the entire plant, based on this newspaper's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" and other documents, and in light of practical situations, has been studying and launching a democratic factory management movement based on the increased awareness of the employees. The employee representative conferences of the plant's various factories have now concluded, and the factory management committee's branch committees in the various factories have also been established, and a plant-wide employee representative conference will soon be convened. At the employee representative conferences in the various factories, employees have engaged in criticism and self-criticism of existing shortcomings, and have put forward many specific suggestions for improving production. This series of work shows that the plant's leading cadres are trying to break out of the circle of preoccupation with routine matters, overcome bureaucratic work styles, and avoid blindly carrying out their work.
    Workers Have Confidence in Increasing Production
    Party Members and League Members Actively Take the Lead in Promoting and Guaranteeing Production
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is equipped with the conditions to "run the factory well." The plant's employees have been considerably mobilized. Workers have extremely high morale for production. For example, in the coking plant, the Jia and Yi groups of the coking furnace increased the suction of the flue on March 15, replaced the fire tube baffles, and raised the second, third, and fourth fire channels to 1,300 degrees Celsius, thus creating a new record of pushing out 60 coke ovens in one day and night. Coke production increased from 240 tons to 280 tons, coking time was reduced from 23 and a half hours to 20 hours, and the actual coking time was reduced from two hours to one and a half hours. The No. 3 boiler room of the power plant uses washed coal stone (waste material) and Datong coal for co-firing, which not only ensures that the firepower is no weaker than before, but also reduces the cost of each kilowatt-hour of electricity from 1.37 kilograms of coal to 0.993 kilograms of coal, saving more than 2,700 kilograms of millet per day. The workers said, "As long as the leadership above leads well and comes up with a plan, we guarantee to complete the task." The work of most retained employees has turned to be more practical, and they often contact workers on the front lines, teach workers production techniques, and mutually examine their own shortcomings. The attitude of viewing employment as a business is also gradually changing, and the phenomenon of complaining and making strange remarks has decreased. Over the past year, the work of the plant's Chinese Communist Party organization, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union has laid a foundation. Chinese Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for one-fifth of the total number of employees in the plant. Party members and League members have played a role in promoting and guaranteeing the completion of production tasks. For example, in the voluntary overtime work of the casting plant and the production competition launched by the coking furnace of the coking plant, Party members, League members, and activists are all vanguards in the movement. Trade union work has gradually shifted from a purely emphasizing welfare perspective to focusing on production as the central task, that is, combining production with expanding, consolidating, and strengthening the organization and system of the trade union, and reasonably resolving worker welfare with the improvement of production tasks. Although these foundations are not very complete, they are beneficial to future production development.
    Urgently Need to Form a Leading Core and Come Up with Ideas to Give to Employees
    Since September of last year, although the ideology and steps of the Party, government, and trade union leadership in the plant have gradually become consistent, a solid leading core has not been formed, so the work lacks focus, has no plan, and the leadership often lags behind the masses. For example, the administrative side did not organize the Party, League, and trade union to comprehensively study this year's production plan, nor did they put the plan in front of the masses to launch a wide-ranging discussion, which resulted in the entire plant still not having a complete plan to this day. At the first employee representative conference of the power plant, a representative said, "Work should not only stay on paper, it must be done after it is said. In the past, the operating rules and disciplinary rules were sometimes not practical, and sometimes they were only placed on the office desk and not given to the masses for discussion before specific implementation. A pile of plans is also useless." The workers in the plant generally said, "Come up with a plan, and if there are difficulties, we will overcome them." Specific facts show that always staying in the office and not relying on the vast masses of workers will inevitably lead to setbacks, no matter how busy you are all day long. After a year of restoration of production work, the cadres who took over the plant have explored more or less experience. However, weighing the new tasks ahead, these experiences are still not enough. Therefore, cadres at all levels should absorb more advanced production experience from the Soviet Union and the Northeast, and pay attention to the study of theory and policy to meet the new tasks. The experience of the trade union director of the Andong Machinery Factory, who went deep into the workshop and created a new record movement for trade union leadership, is worth emulating. At present, some individual leaders in the plant still have a serious bureaucratic work style, and they still need to be patiently enlightened and educated.
    The workers in the plant are confident in developing production. They said, "Come up with a solution, and we guarantee to complete the task." Comrade Zhou Jiahua, the newly appointed director of the plant, is confident in "running the factory well." He said, "We are not afraid to expose shortcomings, we have the courage to accept criticism, and although we have difficulties ahead, as long as the leadership relies on the strength of all employees and unites all employees, in the near future, we will definitely make the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant brand new."

　　石景山钢铁厂领导干部进行检讨
    普遍开展民主管理运动  决心依靠工人办好工厂
    【本报讯】记者一兵报道：石景山钢铁厂正按着“减低成本、提高质量”的生产方针，逐步努力改进各种不合理的制度。去年九、十、十一三个月内，政务院财经委员会、重工业部等机关先后检查出该厂存在着若干严重缺点；今年三月二日，本报揭露该厂领导上有事务主义官僚主义作风，引起该厂职工高度的注意。除该厂军代表张方、副军代表郭际等已公开检讨缺点外（见本报三月廿四日一版），全厂并根据本报“学会管理企业”社论等文件，联系实际，进行学习，在职工们认识提高的基础上，开展工厂管理民主化运动。现该厂所属各厂职工代表会议已经结束，工厂管理委员会所属各厂分会亦已成立，并即将召开全厂职工代表会议。在各厂职工代表会议上，职工们对存在的缺点进行了批评和自我批评，并提出许多改进生产的具体意见。这一系列的工作，说明该厂领导干部力图跳出事务主义圈子，克服官僚主义作风和工作中的盲目性。
    工人具有提高产量的信心
    党员团员积极带头推动和保证了生产
    石景山钢铁厂是具备了“办好工厂”的条件的。全厂职工已有相当发动。工人生产情绪极高。像炼焦厂炼焦炉甲、乙组炉，在三月十五日加大了烟道的吸力，撤换了送火管挡片，使第二、第三、第四火道提升到摄氏一千三百度，因而创造了一昼夜推出六十只炉焦的新纪录，焦炭产量由二百四十吨增至二百八十吨，炼焦时间由二十三个半小时缩短到二十小时，实际成焦时间由二小时缩短到一小时半；动力厂三锅炉房利用洗煤石（废料）和大同煤合烧，不但保证火力比以前不弱，每度电的成本反由一点三七公斤煤降低到零点九九三公斤煤，每天可节省小米二千七百多斤，工人们说：“只要上面领导得好，拿出计划来，我们保证完成任务。”大多数留用职员的工作转向踏实，并经常到现场和工人联系，教授工人生产技术，互相检讨自己的缺点，过去抱雇佣态度的也渐渐的转变过来，发牢骚、说怪话的现象减少了。一年来，该厂中共党的组织，青年团和工会工作已打下基础，该厂中共党员和青年团员占全厂职工人数五分之一，在完成生产任务上，党员和团员都起了推动和保证作用。如铸造厂的义务加班、炼焦厂炼焦炉展开的生产竞赛，党员、团员和积极分子都是运动中的先锋。工会工作已由单纯的强调福利观点，逐渐转入以生产为中心任务、即结合生产，扩大、巩固与健全工会的组织和制度，随着生产任务的提高，合理地解决工人福利。尽管这些基础不甚完备，但对今后发展生产是有利的。
    亟需组成领导核心拿出主意交给职工
    自去年九月以来，该厂党、政、工领导思想和步调虽已渐趋一致，但一直没有形成坚固的领导核心，因此表现在工作上缺乏重心，没有计划，领导往往落在群众的后面。如本年度的生产计划，行政上没有组织党、团、工会来全面研究，没有将计划摆在群众面前展开广泛的讨论，致全厂直到现在尚没有一套完整的计划。动力厂第一届职工代表会议上，一个代表说：“工作不应只停留在书面上，必须说了就做，过去运转规则，纪律通则，有的不切合实际，有的只搁在办公桌上，不拿给群众讨论后具体执行，计划出一大堆，也是不顶用。”该厂工人们普遍地说：“拿出计划来，有困难，我们克服。”具体事实说明老是关在办公室里，而不去依靠广大工人群众，尽管终日忙来忙去，结果必然碰壁。经过一年来的恢复生产工作，该厂接管的干部已经摸索了或多或少的经验，然而权衡今后新的任务，这些经验仍然是不够的，因此各级干部应该多多吸收苏联和东北的生产先进经验，并注意理论和政策的学习，来迎接新的任务。像安东机械厂工会主任深入车间，创造了工会领导新纪录运动的经验，这是值得效法的。目前该厂个别领导人员仍存在着严重的官僚主义作风，还得耐心地进行启发和教育工作。
    该厂工人对发展生产是有信心的。他们说：“拿出办法来，我们保证完成任务。”该厂新任厂长周家骅同志对“办好工厂”是具有信心的，他说：“我们不怕暴露缺点，我们有勇气接受批评，我们面前虽有困难，只要领导上依靠全体职工的力量，团结全体职工，不久的将来，我们必然会使石景山钢铁厂面目一新的。”
