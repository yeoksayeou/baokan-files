　　Immediately Sowing After Rain
    Cotton Sprouts Already Emerging in Guangping
    [This Newspaper's Report] In Guangping, Handan Prefecture, Hebei, after the rain on March 25th, the leadership called on the masses to sow seeds, and the planted cotton has now sprouted. Because there was only about two fingers worth of rain, broadcasting the seeds would not allow them to sprout, so the masses responded to the call and used a seed drill to plant the cotton. In the Masaonggu and other villages of the Fourth District, a portion of cotton was planted with a drill. In the First District, 60% of the sorghum and millet has been sown. The planted cotton is now emerging.
