　　Shangrao Concentration Camp

    Don't Allow You To Think
    The Kuomintang secret agents said, "Don't let you be idle!" "Don't allow you to think!" They used constant, half-day, day and night "special exercises," "labor," "running" and other cruel tortures to destroy the comrades' bodies and spirits.
    Run! Run! Several "run," "kneel," "stand up," and "lie down" in a minute!
    Run! Run! They ran until they stumbled, collapsed from exhaustion, and fainted.
    Run! Run! The comrades firmly believed: "One day, we will run out of this circle."

    不许你们思想
    国民党特务们说，“不让你们闲着!”“不许你们思想!”他们用经常的一连半天，没日没夜的上“特别操”、“劳役”、“跑步”等酷刑来摧残同志们的肉体和精神。
    跑啊！跑啊！一分钟几个“跑步”、“跪下”、“起立”、“卧倒”！
    跑啊！跑啊！跑蹶了，累倒了，昏过去了。
    跑啊！跑啊！同志们坚信：“总有一天，我们会跑出这个圈子去。
