　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The General Administration of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, in order to implement national financial and economic policies, uniformly manage national telecommunications funds, and achieve the goals of unified allocation and rational use, has signed a contract with the Head Office of the People's Bank of China to act as the telecommunications treasury. The contract stipulates that the daily business revenue of local telecommunications bureaus must be fully remitted to the bank on the same day or the next day and transferred to the General Telecommunications Treasury. If there is any delay in payment or underreporting of revenue, the bank has the right and obligation to inspect and urge its entry into the treasury and report the situation to the General Administration of Telecommunications for handling. As for the regular expenses of local telecommunications bureaus, they must go through strict budget and final accounting procedures before funds can be allocated from the treasury for application. This enables the General Administration of Telecommunications to immediately grasp the overall income and expenditure situation and to uniformly allocate and centrally use funds in a planned manner, eliminating the phenomena of disconnection between income and expenditure, decentralized funds, and unbalanced financial development in various regions. After the above-mentioned contract for acting as the telecommunications treasury was signed, the General Administration of Telecommunications, in order to do a good job in this important work, and at the same time understand the situation and solve existing difficulties, sent special personnel to the telecommunications bureaus in North China to help the financial personnel of each bureau study and implement the relevant documents of the telecommunications treasury system, so that they could clearly recognize the importance of unified management of funds for the restoration and construction of the national financial economy and the telecommunications industry, and assist them in establishing the treasury. The telecommunications treasuries of the seven telecommunications administrations of Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, and Xinxiang were established on the 1st of this month, and the amount deposited on that day reached more than 7.3 billion yuan. Now the General Administration of Telecommunications is summarizing experience and preparing to continue to promote it to Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Lanzhou in the middle of this month, and then extend it to the whole country.

　　电信总局建立金库
    各局营业收入须每日悉数缴库
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府邮电部电信总局为执行国家财经政策，统一管理全国电信资金，达到统筹调拨、合理使用的目的，已与中国人民银行总行签订代理电信金库的合同。合同规定各地电信局每日的营业收入，须于当日或次日悉数解缴银行，转解电信总金库；如有迟延不缴或收多缴少情事，银行有权利和义务检查督促其入库，并将情况反映电信总局处理。至于各地电信局的经常开支，必须经过严格的预决算手续，才能由金库拨款应用。这样便使电信总局能够即时掌握全面收支情况，可以有计划地统一调拨和集中使用资金；消灭收支脱节、资金分散和各地财务发展不平衡的现象。上述代理电信金库合同签订后，电信总局为搞好了这一重要工作，同时了解情况，解决存在的困难问题，曾指派专人分赴华北各地电信局，帮助各局财务人员学习实行电信金库制的有关文件，使他们在思想上清楚地认识到统一管理资金对于国家财政经济和电信事业恢复与建设的重要性，并协助其进行建库。北京、天津、张家口、石家庄、太原、归绥、新乡等七个电信管理局的电信金库已于本月一日建立起来，当日解库的款额，达七十三亿余元。现在电信总局正总结经验，准备于本月中旬内继续推行至上海、汉口、广州、重庆、西安、兰州六地，然后推展至全国。
