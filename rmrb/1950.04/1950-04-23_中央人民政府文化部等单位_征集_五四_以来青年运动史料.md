　　Central People's Government Ministry of Culture and other units
    Collect Historical Materials on the Youth Movement Since the "May Fourth" Movement
    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and other units jointly issued an announcement on the 21st to collect historical materials on the Chinese Youth Movement since the May Fourth Movement. The original text is as follows:
    Chinese youth played a pioneering and active role in the people's liberation struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party. It has left behind a series of extremely rich and moving heroic deeds, which are a very important part of the glorious struggle history of the Chinese people. We have decided to hold an exhibition of historical materials on the Chinese Youth Movement this year to mark the 31st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The content includes historical materials on the struggles of Chinese youth under reactionary rule since the May Fourth Movement, materials on participation in armed struggle, land reform, production, study, cultural and sports activities in the liberated areas, and participation in international democratic youth movements for peace and democracy. This will be the basis for continuing to collect scattered historical materials on the youth movement, organize and compile them, and prepare for the establishment of a permanent Chinese Youth Movement Museum in the future. We are soliciting photos, charts, woodcuts, cartoons, slogans, documents, newspapers, books, biographies, models, physical objects, souvenirs, and counter-revolutionary archives and murder weapons related to the youth movement. The methods are divided into: donation, loan or borrowing (returned after reprinting), and purchase. Those who are willing to support us, please contact the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League at No. 3 Yuhe Bridge, Beijing (telephone 5-2947). For other places, please contact the local Chinese New Democratic Youth League Committee or relevant units for consultation. We warmly hope that all government agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life will assist us in doing this important work, and at the same time, we request that relevant departments at all levels in all regions pay attention to this regularly, actively collect materials, and send them to us as soon as possible.
