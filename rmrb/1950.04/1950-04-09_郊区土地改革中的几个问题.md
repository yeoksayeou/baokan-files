　　Several Questions Regarding Land Reform in Suburban Areas

　　Zhao Xiangjun, Northeast Wang Village, West Suburb of Beijing:

　　The questions you raised have been answered by the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government as follows:

　　I. Does renting out houses count as exploitation? How does renting out houses relate to class designation?

　　Answer: Renting out houses is a form of exploitation. However, because the circumstances and effects of renting in today's cities and in rural areas are different, the methods of handling it are also different. The Beijing Military Control Commission promulgated the "Proclamation on Housing Issues in the City" on May 16th of last year, which recognized "the right of homeowners to rent out their houses." This is the reason. In rural areas, the houses occupied by the landlord class are inseparable from the feudal land system. Therefore, regardless of whether they are rented out or not, the surplus houses will be confiscated during land reform (except for those engaged in industry and commerce). The income from rent has a certain relationship with class designation if it affects the family's economic life.

　　II. When houses are distributed to landlords, is it the house they currently live in, or another house?

　　Answer: When confiscating landlords' surplus houses in rural areas, peasants can, based on the specific circumstances, leave them a portion to live in, but it is not necessarily their current residence.

　　III. Should the land distributed to landlords who voluntarily labor be less than that distributed to poor peasants?

　　Answer: During land reform, landlords who voluntarily participate in labor and landlords who rely on land for their livelihood should be given a portion of land roughly equal to that of the peasants. If they have other income, they may be given less or none.

　　IV. A poor peasant's daughter married a landlord for less than a month. How should this be handled when determining class status?

　　Answer: Before land reform, if a poor peasant's daughter married a landlord and lived a landlord's life for five years or more, she was considered a landlord. After land reform, if a poor peasant's daughter marries a landlord, her class status is still that of a poor peasant.

　　V. If individual members of a landlord or rich peasant family engage in acts that infringe upon the interests of the people, does this have any bearing on the class designation of the entire family?

　　Answer: If an individual engages in acts that infringe upon the interests of the people, this responsibility should be borne by that individual and has nothing to do with his family members, let alone the matter of class designation.

　　郊区土地改革中的几个问题北京西郊东北旺村兆祥君：
    你提的问题，已由北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会解答如后：
    一、房屋出租是否算剥削？出租房屋对划阶级有什么关系？
    答：出租房屋是一种剥削，但是，因为这种出租在今天的城市中和在乡村中的情况和作用不同，所以处理的办法也不一样。北京市军事管制委员会曾于去年五月十六日颁布了“关于本市房屋问题布告”，承认“房主有出租其房屋之权”，便是这个原故。在农村里面，地主阶级所占有的房屋，却和封建土地制度分不开，因此，不论其出租不出租，在土地改革时，其多余房屋都是要没收的（经营工商业的不在此例）。房租的收入，对其家庭经济生活有影响的，划阶级时和它有一定的关系。
    二、分给地主房屋，是留给他现在住的，还是另给他别的房屋？
    答：征收地主在农村中的多余的房屋时，农民可根据具体情况，给他留一部分居住，但不一定是他的现住房。
    三、分土地给自愿劳动的地主，是否应比贫农分地少些？
    答：土地改革中，对于自愿参加劳动的地主以及依靠土地为生活的地主，应留给他一份大体与农民相等的土地；如果有其他收入的，可以少给或不给。
    四、贫农女儿嫁给地主时间没有超过一个月，在划阶级时，应该怎样处理？
    答：在土地改革以前，贫农女儿和地主结婚，过地主生活已满五年的，才算地主成份。土地改革以后，贫农女儿和地主结婚，成份还是贫农。
    五、地主、富农家里个别分子，有侵犯人民利益行为，和他全家划成份有关系吗？
    答：个人有侵犯人民利益行为，这个责任，应由他个人负，与他的家人无关，更与划成份一事无关。 编者
