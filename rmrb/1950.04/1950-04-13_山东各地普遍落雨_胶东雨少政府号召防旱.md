Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th. Since the beginning of spring, Shandong Province has generally experienced spring rainfall, which is extremely beneficial for the development of spring plowing. In the Lu Zhongnan area, there were three rainfalls in March alone, with the rainfall on the 24th and 25th accounting for about half a plow. At the beginning of April, when the area was in the midst of spring plowing and sowing, there was another widespread timely rain. Since the beginning of spring, the rainfall around Xuzhou has been 133.9 mm. In the Bohai area, there was a widespread rainfall of about two or three fingers on March 25th and 26th. The spring rain that has fallen in the above-mentioned areas is sufficient for spring plowing and sowing, and it is even more beneficial for the development of wheat seedlings. Farmers are overjoyed and are now stepping up spring plowing and sowing. Only the Jiaodong area has received less rain since the beginning of spring. The Administrative Office of the area issued instructions on disaster prevention and drought control on April 4, calling on all localities to carry out well-digging and watering, and to use river water, bay water, and spring water to irrigate wheat fields.

　　山东各地普遍落雨
    胶东雨少政府号召防旱
    【新华社济南十二日电】山东各地入春以来普降春雨，对开展春耕裨益极大。鲁中南区仅三月份即降雨三次，其中二十四、五两日所降雨量约半犁。四月初该区正值春耕播种之际，又普降时雨。徐州周围自立春以来，已降雨量为一三三·九公厘。渤海区于三月二十五、六两日普遍降雨约二、三指。上述各地所降春雨，足够春耕春种之用，对麦苗发育裨益更大。农民喜形于色，现正加紧春耕播种。唯胶东区入春以来落雨较少。现该区行署已于四月四日发出防灾防旱工作指示，号召各地开展打井浇地，利用河水、湾水、泉水灌溉麦田。
