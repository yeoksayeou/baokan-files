　　The People's Governments of Fengzhen and Other Counties in Suiyuan Province
    Reform Opium Smokers and Encourage Participation in Production
    [Our Newspaper, Gui Sui News] In Suiyuan, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, opium smoking was extremely common, even to the point where every village had opium smokers. After liberation, the People's Governments of Fengzhen and other counties immediately called on smokers to quit their addiction. Jining County established opium detoxification centers in counties, districts, and villages; Fengzhen and Wudong established labor teams in counties and districts, reforming opium smokers through labor. According to recent statistics from various counties, in Jining Chengguan, under the planned education and reformation of the opium detoxification centers, more than two hundred male and female opium smokers quit their addiction within forty days. In the Dalikuohao Village opium detoxification center in the Second District, in less than twenty days, twenty-two out of thirty-six opium smokers quit their addiction and left the center to participate in production. In Fengzhen's Third District alone, from November of last year to the end of March of this year, out of 621 opium smokers in the entire district, 527 have been initially reformed through persuasion and education by district and village cadres, resolution of production materials, and supervision of production.

　　绥远丰镇等县人民政府
    改造烟民参加生产
    【本报归绥讯】绥远在国民党反动统治时期吸大烟者极为普遍，甚至村村有烟民。解放后，丰镇等县人民政府即号召吸烟者戒绝烟瘾。集宁县、区、村设立了戒烟所；丰镇、武东在县、区成立了劳动队，从劳动中改造烟民。据最近各县统计，集宁城关在戒烟所有计划的教育改造下，四十天内即有男女烟民二百余戒绝了烟瘾。二区大六号村戒烟所不及二十天，三十六个烟民即有二十二人戒绝出所参加生产。丰镇仅第三区从去年十一月起至今年三月底全区六百二十一名烟民，经过区村干部说服教育，解决生产资料，监督生产，已有五百二十七名得到初步改造。
