　　Repaired Roads Damaged Again
    Beijing Municipal Agencies Should Strengthen Communication

To the Editor:
    I have discovered the following situation: the Construction Bureau has just finished repairing a section of road, and then the Sanitation Engineering Bureau comes to dredge the sewers, and the Water Company also comes to renovate the water pipes. This results in the road surface being damaged again. For example, the section of Beigouyan Street from North Wuwanghou to South Fengsheng Hutong in Xisi was repaired by the Construction Bureau over dozens of days. But now the Sanitation Engineering Bureau is dredging the sewers there, creating mud and gravel all over the road. The Water Company is also digging trenches there to install main pipes. Digging the trenches for the main pipes on the side of the road doesn't cause much obstruction, but renovating the branch pipes requires crossing the road. They have already dug three or four such trenches, and filling them back up will be laborious and difficult to level. I believe this is a waste of manpower and resources. I suggest that the above departments should maintain close contact in their future work and try to avoid this phenomenon.

### 修好马路又遭损害  京市各机关应加强联系

　　修好马路又遭损害
    京市各机关应加强联系编辑同志：
    我发现了这样一个情况：建设局刚刚修好一段马路，卫生工程局就来掏挖下水道，自来水公司也来装修自来水管。这样，路面就又被破坏了。如北沟沿从西四北武王侯到西四南丰盛胡同这段，建设局经过数十天时间，才修理完工。但现在卫生工程局又在那里掏挖下水道，弄的满路污泥和碎石头。自来水公司也在那里挖沟装设干管，装设干管的沟挖在马路边上，还没有什么妨碍，但装修支管却要横穿马路，现在他们已经挖了三、四条这样的沟，以后填起来又费工，又填不平。我认为这是一种人力与物力的浪费。我建议上述几个部门今后在工作中应取得密切联系，尽力避免这种现象。
