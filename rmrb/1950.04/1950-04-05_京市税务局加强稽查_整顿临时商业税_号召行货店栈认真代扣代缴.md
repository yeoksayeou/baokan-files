Beijing News Agency Report: The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau is strengthening inspection work to strictly rectify the phenomenon of tax evasion in temporary business (peddler) tax. The tax evasion of temporary business tax in Beijing in February and March was quite serious. According to the statistics of the Municipal Tax Bureau, this kind of tax revenue was equivalent to over 1.5 million jin of rice in January, but it dropped to just over 1.18 million jin in February, and only just over 1.2 million jin in March. The decline in this tax revenue is due in part to the stable prices and slightly smaller temporary business activities in the past two months, but the main reason is still the serious phenomenon of tax evasion. Because the tax bureau's inspection cadres were busy with the supplementary tax on goods and the collection of industrial and commercial tax in February and March, some illegal merchants took the opportunity to evade taxes. For example, Tongyi Wholesale Shop on Waitiao (Outer) Yichang Lane used two sets of books, one true and one false, and concealed more than 286 million yuan of turnover on January 28 alone. The tax evasion on peddler's tax alone amounted to more than 8 million yuan. Another example is Lulin Auction House in Chunshu Hutong, Neiyi District, which only recorded commissions or profits in its books, without recording sales turnover, evading more than 1.3 million yuan in temporary business tax. Dachang Flour Mill in Shifuma Street, Neier District, did not record large quantities of goods entering and leaving the factory, evading more than 760,000 yuan in taxes from January to March. In response to this kind of tax evasion, the Municipal Tax Bureau, in addition to educating the wholesale shops and businesses that withhold and pay temporary business tax to be conscientious and responsible, has decided to further strengthen inspection work to rectify the collection of temporary business tax.

Beijing News Agency Report: In order to rectify the income from temporary business (peddler) tax, the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau convened a meeting of managers and representatives of wholesale shops and businesses at the Democratic Theater yesterday (4th) afternoon, calling on everyone to be conscientious and responsible in withholding and paying temporary business tax, and not to illegally evade taxes. At the beginning of the meeting, Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Tax Bureau, delivered a speech. After explaining the tax policy of the People's Government, he particularly pointed out that although peddlers play a role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas to a certain extent, they are generally not professional businesses, have small burdens, and the profits they get are greater than those of general stationary businesses. If they are allowed to evade taxes, it will seriously affect the operation of fixed industrial and commercial operators. He hoped that the managers and representatives of the wholesale shops and businesses must recognize their responsibilities to the country and the people, and conscientiously withhold and report temporary business tax in the business of buying and selling on behalf of customers, and must not have any more tax evasion attempts. After Director Zhao's report, Wu Xing, Chief of the Direct Tax Section of the Tax Bureau, reported on matters related to the collection of temporary business tax: 1. Scope and objects of taxation: All those who do not have a fixed place of business but operate commercial activities intermittently, and the part of the business of stationary businesses in this city that exceeds the reported business scope, shall be taxed as peddler's tax unless otherwise specified. And from this (4th) day, according to the unified regulations of the Central Government, peddlers and stallholders from other places (regardless of whether they are public, private or cooperative businesses) who come to Beijing to sell goods, must pay temporary business tax in this city, regardless of whether they have certificates or tax payment vouchers, except for those who produce and sell their own products and have certificates from the local government. 2. Withholding and payment by wholesale shops: In order to facilitate control, the Municipal Tax Bureau has stipulated that the relevant wholesale shops and businesses in this city should implement the method of withholding and paying taxes on behalf of others, but they must first register with the competent tax authorities, abide by government laws and regulations, conscientiously withhold taxes, and report and pay them on time. The government will give a handling fee of 2% to wholesale shops and businesses that withhold temporary business tax. 3. Penalties: Anyone who withholds taxes privately without registration and approval, fails to report and pay taxes on time by the withholding business households, falsifies account books, evades taxes, or embezzles taxes or extorts money under false pretenses, is an illegal act. The Municipal Tax Bureau will impose fines or send them to judicial organs for punishment according to the seriousness of the circumstances.

    【京市新闻处讯】京市税务局正加强稽查工作，严格整顿临时商业税漏税现象。本市二、三月份临时商业（行商）税的漏税现象颇为严重，据市税务局统计，此种税收在一月份折米一百五十万余斤，二月份即落至一百十八万余斤，三月份也只有一百二十余万斤。此种税收减少原因，虽受两月来物价平稳，临时商业活动稍小的影响，但主要的仍是漏税现象严重所致，由于税局的稽查工作干部在二、三月间忙于货物补税及工商业税征收工作，一些不法商人便更借机偷税。如外一长巷上四条同益货栈用真、假两套账，仅今年一月二十八日所隐漏的流水就有二亿八千六百余万元，其中行商税一项，偷税即达八百多万元。又如内一区椿树胡同鲁麟拍卖行，账上仅记佣金或所得利益，不载销货流水，偷漏临时商业税一百三十余万元；内二区石驸马大街大昌面粉厂，大批进销货都不记账，一月至三月漏税七十六万多元。市税务局对此类漏税现象，除教育代扣缴临时商业税的行栈商号认真负责外，并决进一步加强稽查工作，以整顿临时商业税的征收。
