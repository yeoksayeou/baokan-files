　　National Economic Defense Work Conference Opens
    Luo Ruiqing Calls for Relying on the Working Class, Strengthening Specialized Work, and Ensuring the Safe Progress of Economic Construction.
    [Xinhua News Agency] The National Economic Defense Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government officially opened at 9:00 AM on April 21st. Over 100 representatives from the Northeast, North China, East China, Central South and other regions, as well as representatives from relevant central government departments, attended. Minister Luo Ruiqing addressed the conference. Minister Luo briefly described the current domestic situation. He said that the reactionaries have been overthrown. Except for Taiwan and Tibet, which are yet to be liberated, the People's China is beginning to enter a new historical period of peaceful construction. Economic construction is the most important task of the country. Therefore, the arduous and important task of ensuring the safe progress of national economic construction and protecting the people's wealth from loss has been placed before the public security organs at all levels of our country. Minister Luo emphasized that although the Chinese and foreign reactionaries have been overthrown in China, they are not reconciled to their defeat. On the contrary, they are intensifying their frantic struggle and sabotage day and night. After listing several examples, Minister Luo then analyzed in detail the fully favorable conditions and some difficult conditions for eliminating the remnants of the counter-revolutionaries and crushing the counter-revolutionary sabotage conspiracies, as well as the long-term nature of this hidden struggle. He called on public security and defense work cadres to not be complacent in the slightest, to conscientiously summarize and carry forward the successful experiences in economic defense work, overcome all difficulties, and more effectively stop the counter-revolutionary elements' sabotage activities against the national economy. Regarding the future direction of economic defense work, Minister Luo pointed out that it is necessary to rely on the working class and strengthen the specialized work of economic defense, and prevent the isolationist tendency of public security work that does not rely on the masses and the tendency of simply emphasizing relying on the masses while neglecting specialized work. Finally, Minister Luo explained the spirit of the lenient policy and pointed out that those counter-revolutionary elements who resolutely engage in sabotage against the People's China must be severely suppressed.
