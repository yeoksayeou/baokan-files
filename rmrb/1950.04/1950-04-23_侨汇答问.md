　　Q&A on Overseas Remittances
    Recently, this publication has received many letters inquiring about how to handle overseas remittances. We have summarized them into the following questions, which are answered by the Business Department of the Head Office of the Bank of China.
        —Editor
    Q: How should overseas Chinese remit money to China?
    A: (1) For countries that have established diplomatic relations with China, where the Bank of China has branches, the Head Office has established leadership relationships with them. Therefore, they can all accept remittances from overseas Chinese. These include London in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Penang in Malaya, Jakarta in Indonesia, Calcutta and Bombay in India, Karachi and Chittagong in Pakistan, Rangoon in Burma, and Hong Kong.
    (2) If the overseas Chinese are located in a place without a Bank of China, or if there is a Bank of China but it is outside of the eleven locations mentioned above and without diplomatic relations, they can find other local banks to handle the remittance procedures. However, these banks must have established agency relationships with the Bank of China in China or commercial banks with designated foreign exchange bank status.
    (3) You can also use local letter of credit agencies, but apart from Guangdong and Fujian provinces, there are very few letter of credit agencies in other parts of China that handle overseas remittances. Therefore, entrusting overseas letter of credit agencies to handle overseas remittances to areas other than Guangdong and Fujian would require them to entrust the Bank of China in China to handle the remittance, which would be a circuitous process. It would be faster to directly entrust the banks mentioned above to handle the remittance.
    (4) If none of the above three methods are convenient in the place where the remittance is being made, you can buy a Hong Kong dollar draft payable in Hong Kong or a U.S. dollar draft payable in New York from a reputable foreign bank, write the detailed address of the recipient in China, and send it by registered mail to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. It will be quickly transferred to the destination.
    (5) If remitting to Beijing, it is best to have the Bank of China remit directly. You can also use banks such as Xinhua, Shanghai Commercial, and HSBC.
    Q: How to remit money?
    A: To protect the interests of remitters and prevent losses due to adjustments in foreign exchange rates during the remittance process, the overseas branches of the Bank of China remit money in local currency or converted into Hong Kong dollars. Other banks and letter of credit agencies are also generally required to remit in the original currency. We hope that overseas Chinese will firmly request them to do so. As for the remittance method, it is the same as remitting ordinary funds.
    Q: How much is the handling fee?
    A: To reduce the burden on remitters, the Bank of China currently only charges postage and telegram fees for overseas remittances. No handling fees are charged. However, other banks and letter of credit agencies will charge fees.
    Q: How are remittances in the original currency converted and paid out in China?
    A: The original currency remittance received can be converted into RMB at the foreign exchange rate on the date of payment. If the recipient does not need to use the received original currency remittance immediately, or only needs to use part of it, they can open a foreign currency current account at the Bank of China. All or part of the remittance can be handled, and later, when needed, RMB can be withdrawn at any time at the foreign exchange rate of the day.
    Q: What if there are no such banks in the receiving location?
    A: As long as there is a People's Bank or post office near the receiving location, the Bank of China can entrust them to handle the remittance without charging any transfer fees, and is also in contact with transferring in the original currency.
    Q: If there are regular remittances coming back, is there a simpler method?
    A: Yes. The Bank of China abroad is currently offering a service called "Scheduled Fixed Amount Remittance." As long as the remitter registers with the Bank of China abroad, specifies the place of payment and the name of the recipient in China, the number of times the payment is made per month, the date of payment, and the amount of each payment. After completing this procedure, on the agreed date, the remitter pays abroad, and the recipient can collect the money in China. For this type of remittance, the Bank of China in China must pay on schedule without waiting for the funds to arrive. The procedure is very simple.
    Q: If there are any questions about overseas remittances, where can I go to ask for detailed answers?
    A: If you have any questions, you can call, write, or go directly to the Bank of China at No. 1 Xijiaominxiang, Beijing (telephone number 3-4340) for detailed answers.

### 侨汇答问

　　侨汇答问
    近来本刊接到不少来信，询问如何办理侨汇，兹归纳成如下几个问题，并由中国银行总管理处营业部加以解答。
        ——编者
    问：国外侨胞对国内汇款应该怎样办理？
    答：（一）与我国建立外交关系的国家，有中国银行设在那里的，总管理处对他们都已建立了领导关系，因此都可以接受侨胞的汇款，如英国的伦敦，马来亚的新加坡，吉隆坡和榔槟屿，印尼的耶各达，印度的加尔各答和孟买，巴基斯坦的喀拉蚩和吉大港，缅甸的仰光和香港等十一个地方。
    （二）如国外侨胞所在地，没有中国银行或虽有中国银行但在上述十一个地方以外的无外交关系的地方，则可找当地的其他银行办理汇款手续。但这些银行必须是与国内中国银行或有外汇指定银行身份的商业银行，建立了代理关系的。
    （三）找当地的批信局也可办理，但除广东福建两省以外，国内其他各地经解侨汇的批信局很少，因此委托国外批信局代解广东福建以外地区的侨汇，他们就得转托国内的中国银行代解，这样辗转的关系，反不如直接托上述所举的银行汇来，要比较快捷。
    （四）假使在国外汇款的地方，上述三种办法都不方便，那么可以向国外信用好的外商银行去买一张香港付款的港币汇票，或美国纽约付款的美金汇票，写明国内收款人的详细地址，一起用挂号信寄交香港中国银行，就可很快的转汇到目的地。
    （五）如汇款来北京，最好能交中国银行直接汇来。也可交新华、上海商业、汇丰等银行承汇。
    问：汇款的方法怎样？
    答：为了照顾汇款人的利益，不受在汇款过程中因外汇牌价的调整而受到损失，中国银行的国外分行一律用当地货币或折换港币汇来，其他银行与批信局，原则上也规定用原币汇款的，希望侨胞们坚决要求他们这样做，至于汇款的方法，与汇普通款一样。
    问：要收多少手续费？
    答：政府为减轻汇款人的负担，目前在国外的中国银行汇款，只酌收邮电费，手续费是不收的，但经过其他银行及批信局办理的，是要收费的。
    问：原币汇款汇到国内如何折算付给？
    答：收到的原币汇款，可以按付款日的外汇牌价折取人民币。如果收款人对所收的原币汇款，不立即需用，或需用一部分，可以把汇来的款项在中国银行开立外汇活期存款，全部或一部分都可以照办，以后需用随时凭摺按当天的外汇牌价折取人民币。
    问：假使收款地点没有上述银行，又怎么办？
    答：只要在靠近收款的地方，有人民银行或邮局，中国银行都可委托他们代解，不收任何转解费用，而且还在接洽用原币转汇中。
    问：倘使经常有一定的汇款汇回来，是否有更简便的办法？
    答：有的。现在国外中国银行正在举办一种名叫“约期定额汇款”，只要汇款人向国外的中国银行登记，指定国内付款的地方与收款人姓名，及按月交款的次数和交款的日期暨每次交款的数目。备妥了这个手续以后，到了约定日期，汇款人一面在国外交款，收款人一面便能在国内领款了。这种汇款国内的中国银行不待款项汇到，即须按期照付，手续非常简便。
    问：对侨汇问题，如还有不明白的地方，向什么地方去问，可以得到详细的答复？
    答：你假使还有什么疑问，可以用电话、写信或直接到本市西交民巷一号中国银行（电话三局四三四○号），去询问，一定能够得到详细的解答。
