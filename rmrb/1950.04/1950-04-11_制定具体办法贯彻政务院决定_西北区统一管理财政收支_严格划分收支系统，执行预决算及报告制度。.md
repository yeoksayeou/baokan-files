[From Our Correspondent in Xi'an, Lin Wei]: In order to implement the decision of the Central People's Government Administration Council on unified management of financial revenue and expenditure, the Northwest Administrative Region formulated specific implementation measures at the financial conference held in mid-March. According to the central government's decision, this method divides the financial revenue system and expenditure system, as well as revenue and expenditure items, strictly separates the financial revenue of the central government from that of the administrative region, provinces, cities, and counties, and emphasizes that no organization or individual has the right to arbitrarily use revenue belonging to the central government. It stipulates that financial authorities at all levels should distribute revenue tasks to revenue collection agencies on a quarterly and monthly basis according to the annual revenue plan, and supervise and inspect them at any time. Establish a timely reporting system for financial and taxation departments. Regarding the management of financial expenditure, the method emphasizes strict implementation of the budgeting and final accounting system. Within the budget scope, when provincial finance departments request appropriations from the Northwest Finance Department, they must also report the treasury revenue balance of the province. If there is no revenue report, the Finance Department will refuse to allocate funds. If provinces and cities fail to complete their revenue tasks on time, their administrative expenses for the month will be reduced. The reduced portion will be supplemented in the future when the task is exceeded. All financial expenditures of all agencies must prepare monthly and quarterly payment statements. No budget will be reviewed without a payment statement, and no funds will be allocated without a budget.

Revenue and Expenditure are Handled According to Certain Procedures to Overcome Past Confusion

In addition, it is stipulated that all transfers and payments of financial funds must be handled according to financial procedures; no organization shall set its own standards or collect and use funds independently. Financial funds received by various agencies shall not be used to purchase non-saleable materials. Even the materials needed for supply are not allowed to be hoarded, let alone used for business. All financial surpluses of various units (excluding surplus food expenses) shall be turned over to the public in full, and the turnover time shall be once every six months. These specific measures are very powerful and timely for changing certain chaotic phenomena existing in the financial revenue and expenditure of the Northwest region in the past. Although unified revenue and expenditure have been implemented in the Northwest in the past, some units still misappropriated financial revenue at will, or did not report revenue, or reported it after it was used, or did not turn over surpluses, etc. Fifteen cases of misappropriation of public grain and received materials have been discovered in Shaanxi Province, involving a total of more than 380,000 kilograms of various types of public grain and 5,000 kilograms of cotton. The director of the Chengguan warehouse in Fuping County even privately lent 20,000 kilograms of public grain to a grain store. Some did not even notify their superiors before misappropriating; others reported to their superiors but used the funds themselves without approval. In terms of taxation, the phenomenon of using public funds from revenue for personal use has also been discovered. For example, Gansu Province used 2.8 billion yuan; Ningxia used 400-500 million yuan. These were all borrowed by the government. The tax bureaus of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and some special districts also had cases of using tax funds. During the liberation of the Greater Northwest last year, some of the materials seized, received, and confiscated by various agencies were converted into cash and used locally without reporting. Only Xi'an submitted a form after using the funds. Many agencies have income in their undertakings, some do not report at all; some only say they have income but do not report the income figures. In the past, the financial departments did not pay close attention to the revenue part. They knew that certain agencies had certain income, but they did not urge them to report it, let alone send people to check, calculate, and clarify the amount in time. When these agencies with income received funding, they were still given the amount they should have received, so these units with income had surpluses. They controlled a large amount of cash. Some deposited it in the bank to earn interest (when the Xi'an Transportation Bank closed its accounts on March 25, it had 4.69143 billion yuan in deposits from various agencies), and some hoarded materials when prices fluctuated. The financial departments focused most closely on tax revenue; however, they did not strictly urge all units to report on time. For example, the monthly tax report of the General Taxation Bureau was often reported only once every two or three months. There has never been a definite figure for various taxes. In terms of expenditure, the budgets made by various places mostly did not have calculation explanations, and some units had not yet established a budgeting system. These situations greatly increased the chaos in financial revenue and expenditure. This method decided by the Northwest Region will overcome these chaotic phenomena.

　　制定具体办法贯彻政务院决定
    西北区统一管理财政收支
    严格划分收支系统，执行预决算及报告制度。
    【本报西安讯】特派记者林韦报道：西北行政区为贯彻实现中央人民政府政务院关于统一管理财政收支的决定，已于三月中旬召开的财政会议上，制定了具体执行的办法。这个办法根据中央的决定，划分了财政收入系统和支出系统及收支项目，规定中央与行政区、省、市、县的财政收入严格分清，强调任何机关、个人无权擅自动用属于中央的收入。规定各级财政机关要根据全年收入计划，按季按月分配收入任务给收入机关，并随时督促检查。建立财政税收部门的按时报告制度。关于财政支出的管理，该办法强调严格执行预决算制度。在预算范围内，各省财政厅要求西北财政部拨款时，要同时报告该省国库收入结存情况，如无收入报告，财政部拒绝拨款。各省市未按期完成收入任务的，在该省市本月行政费内减发。减发部分于以后超过任务内补发。各机关一切财政开支，要按月按季编造支付计算书，无计算书不审核预算，无预算不拨款。
    收支都按一定手续克服过去混乱现象
    此外，规定凡财政款项的调拨支付，一律要按财政手续；任何机关不得自定标准或自收自用。各机关所领财政款项，不得买卖非卖品的物资，即是供给所需要的物资也不准囤积，更不准做营业。各单位一切财政节余（节余的伙食费除外）要扫数缴公，交公时间半年一次。这些具体办法，对于改变过去西北地区财政收支中存在着的某些混乱现象，是非常有力而且恰合时宜的。西北过去虽然已经实行了统筹统支，但仍有些单位随意挪用财政收入，或收入不报，或用完再报，或节余不上交等。陕西省已发现挪用公粮与接收物资事件十五起，共挪用各类公粮三十八万多斤，棉花五千斤。富平县城关仓库主任竟私自借给粮店公粮达两万斤。有的在挪用之前根本没有向上级打过招呼；有的是向上级报告了，但没有经上级批准，自己就用了。在税收方面，也发现了将收入的公款先尽自己动用的现象。如甘肃省用了二十八亿元；宁夏用了四、五亿元。这些都是政府借用的。甘肃、宁夏、青海等省税务局与某些专区税务局，也有动用税款情事。在去年大西北解放时，各机关缴获、接收与没收的物资，有些是在当地变成现款用了，没有报告。只有西安在用过之后补了一张表报。不少的机关在事业上有收入，有的根本不报；有的只说有收入而不报收入数字。财政部门过去对于收入部分抓得不紧，明明知道某些机关有某项收入，但未抓紧让他们上报，更没有及时派人去检查，计算及弄清数目。当这些有收入的机关领取经费时，仍按应领数领给，于是，这些有收入的单位都有节余。他们掌握了大批现款。有的存到银行去生息（西安交通银行三月二十五日结账时，即有各机关存款四十六亿九千一百四十三万元），有的在物价波动时去囤积物资。财政部门对税收是抓得最紧的；但也未严格的督促各单位按时报告。例如税务总局的税收月报，常常是两、三个月才能报告一次。各种税收，一直没有一个确切的数字。在开支方面，各地造的预算多半没有计算说明，有的单位还没有建立起预决算制度。这些情况大大增加了财政收支的混乱。西北区决定的这个办法，是会克服这些混乱现象的。
