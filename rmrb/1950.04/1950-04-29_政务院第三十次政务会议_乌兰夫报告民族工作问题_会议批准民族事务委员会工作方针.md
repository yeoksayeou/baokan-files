Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The 30th Political Affairs Council meeting of the Central People's Government was held this afternoon at 3:30 PM. At the meeting, Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, gave a report on the current issues in nationalities work. Ulanhu said in his report: Due to the establishment of the Central People's Government and the victorious development of the People's Liberation War, the relationship between nationalities within the country, except for Tibet and Taiwan in the areas awaiting liberation, has undergone a fundamental change nationwide—from a relationship of oppression and being oppressed to one of equality and mutual assistance. All minority nationalities people enthusiastically support the Central People's Government and the nationalities policy in the Common Program. They believe that the policies of national equality, unity, mutual assistance, and regional autonomy are precisely the long-cherished wishes of many years. Today's problem is how to minimize the remaining gaps and contradictions between nationalities, strengthen and consolidate the unity of the people of all nationalities, and help all minority nationalities gradually develop their politics, economy, and culture in a planned and step-by-step manner as much as possible. Due to the extremely uneven political, economic, and cultural development of the various minority nationality areas, all our work must adopt a cautious and gradual approach, and move forward steadily. Any rash approach will lead to serious mistakes or even serious losses. This requires special attention in the new areas.

Subsequently, Li Weihan, Chairman of the Commission, and Wang Feng, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, made supplementary speeches. After listening to and discussing the above reports and supplementary speeches on nationalities work issues, the meeting approved the working guidelines of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. In addition, the meeting also passed several appointments and motions to be submitted to the Central People's Government Committee for approval.

　　政务院第三十次政务会议
    乌兰夫报告民族工作问题
    会议批准民族事务委员会工作方针
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府政务院第三十次政务会议于今日下午三时半举行。会上，中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员乌兰夫作了关于当前民族工作问题的报告。乌兰夫报告中说：由于中央人民政府的成立和人民解放战争的胜利发展，国内的民族关系，除待解放区西藏和台湾外，已经在全国范围内起了根本的变化——从压迫、被压迫的关系转变到平等、互助。各少数民族人民都热诚的拥护中央人民政府及共同纲领中的民族政策，他们认为民族平等、团结、互助和区域自治的政策，正是他们多年来殷切的愿望。今天的问题是如何尽量减除民族间残存的隔阂和矛盾，加强和巩固各民族人民的团结，并尽可能有计划、有步骤地帮助各少数民族逐渐发展其政治、经济和文化。由于各少数民族地区政治、经济、文化发展的极不平衡，我们的一切工作必须采取慎重缓进的方针，稳步前进。一切急性的做法，必会犯严重的错误甚至造成严重的损失。这在新区，尤须特别注意。
    继由该会主任委员李维汉及西北军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋作补充发言。会议在听取和讨论了以上关于民族工作问题的报告和补充发言后，批准了中央人民政府民族事务委员会的工作方针。此外，会议并通过任命及提请中央人民政府委员会批准任命案多起。
