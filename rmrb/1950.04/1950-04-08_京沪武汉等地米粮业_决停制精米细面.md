Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Changing Grain Processing Standards and Increasing Edible Grain" has been warmly embraced in many regions. Twelve labor unions, including those for private oil, salt, grain, restaurant, and hotel industries in Beijing, jointly issued a notice on the 4th of this month, calling on all members to discuss specific measures for implementing this decision and to propose to employers that they no longer purchase, produce, or operate grain, flour, and food that do not meet the prescribed standards. Industries in Tianjin such as flour mills, grinding shops, Chinese and Western restaurants, and cake shops have unanimously supported this decision by the Government Administration Council. Zhao Jiyang, chairman of the Flour Industry Association, said: Manufacturing "August 1st" flour can produce at least two more catties of flour per hundred catties of wheat compared to the current "Li Zi" flour. This is a considerable amount when added up. In Shanghai, the East China Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation has begun processing in accordance with the standards stipulated in the Government Administration Council's decision on the 4th of this month. The Central South Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation in Wuhan also notified its subordinate branches and sub-branches on the 3rd of this month to implement the Government Administration Council's decision. Its affiliated Wufeng and Zhongfu flour mills, Hankou Rice Mill, and more than one hundred private processing plants that process for the company have all stopped processing refined rice and refined flour. The Kaifeng Branch of the company and various organs, troops, organizations, schools, and enterprises in Kaifeng City have not only expressed their firm commitment to implementing the decision but have also launched a publicity campaign throughout the city to "eat coarse rice and coarse flour." The preparatory office of the Chongqing Cereals Corporation notified all rice-selling units under its jurisdiction on the 3rd of this month, stipulating that from the 4th, they should stop selling twice-milled rice and only sell once-milled rice and Qi rice. The preparatory office of the Kunming City Trade Corporation in Yunnan Province is currently preparing specific measures for the processing and sale of standard rice and flour.
