　　Cultural Train is Very Popular
　　The cultural train is jointly organized by the Ministry of Railways and the China Youth Art Theatre. The train's first working route is along the Longhai Railway to Luoyang, Xi'an and other places, and the working time is about half a year. The accompanying work units also include a photography team from the Beijing Film Studio, and a mobile cultural supply station jointly formed by publishing institutions such as Xinhua Bookstore, Sanlian Bookstore, Workers' Publishing House, and Youth Publishing House. The following letter is from the train club to the Youth Art Theatre. From this letter, we can see how railway employees and the masses along the route welcome the cultural workers who serve them.
　　　　　　Editor
　　　　　　　　　　　　To all Comrades of the Youth Theatre:
　　We left Beijing at 8:00 pm on March 25th, and arrived at our first stage working destination - Luoyang at 4:00 pm on the 30th.
　　During the five days of driving, we performed seven times for the workers at the stations along the route, and received their cordial hospitality and warm welcome. We seized the time to humbly learn from the people. In Dingxian, we invited experienced farmers who were experienced with Yangko to perform and teach us how to sing; in Shijiazhuang, we invited Comrade Wei Lianzhen, a worker playwright, to give a report.
　　On the second day after we arrived in Luoyang, we plunged into a tense working upsurge. In the morning of the 31st, we invited Director Yang of the Political Department of the First Detachment of the Railway Corps to give a report on "The Situation of the First Detachment". In the afternoon, we started to set up the stage, and showed a movie in the evening.
　　On April 1st, we performed all the short programs, including "Anti-Somersault", "Glorious Lamp", "Good News", "The Army Loves the People and the People Support the Army", "Old Geng Catches Up with the Team", and "Victory Waist Drum". Each program aroused stormy applause from the soldiers and folks; the stage was in the original aircraft hangar, crowded with more than 2,000 spectators.
　　On April 2nd, our performance of "Patriot" was also very popular with the audience, and the soldiers also asked us to add programs, specifically requesting "Dayangko" and "Sending Public Grain." We temporarily added "Dayangko" and "Victory Waist Drum".
　　The soldiers' welcome to us is unparalleled. They wrote welcome letters to us, and insisted that we accept the pork and cigarettes they sent. The highest leader of the First Detachment of the garrison came to the train to visit and comfort us. The soldiers often come to our train club to play, and we also often go to the technology company and propaganda team to play. The comrades of the technology company helped us pull wires, and the comrades of the propaganda team helped us set up the stage. We asked them for their opinions, and they said: "There is only one, that is, come more often and perform more!"
　　Our photos and books have been exhibited for three days since the 1st, and the two exhibition rooms are crowded with soldiers!
　　On April 3rd, the stage was dismantled, and the club organized the comrades to take a bath and wash clothes, and had a dumpling dinner in the evening; the soldiers surrounded us, reluctant to let us go.
　　On April 4th, we left Luoyang and went deep into the First Great Team of the First Detachment of the Railway Corps. There, in addition to studying Comrade Stalin and Chairman Mao's documents on "Communists must be good at uniting and cooperating with non-Party masses", all comrades went deep into the scene and the company to approach the soldiers and learn from the soldiers.
　　Today (the 7th), the Luoyang Bridge held a traffic opening ceremony (the Luoyang Bridge, which had not been repaired in the twelve years under the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, was completed yesterday by all the comrades of the Bridge Brigade of the First Great Team of the First Detachment of our Railway Corps), the "Cultural Train" participated in this ceremony, and drove over this bridge for the first time, we feel great honor! Performing short plays in the evening. We plan to perform for four consecutive days, and leave here on the 12th to work for a week each in the 21st and 25th Great Team. This is how the work in the First Detachment will be for one month. We firmly believe that we can do our work well!
　　The cultural train is welcomed by soldiers, workers and peasants everywhere, which means that they need new cultural food, and it also fully shows the great significance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction on the country's literary and artistic front!
　　Salute to the revolution!
　　All Comrades of the Youth Cultural Train Club of the Ministry of Railways April 7th

　　文化列车大受欢迎
    文化列车是铁道部和中国青年艺术剧院联合组织的。列车第一次的工作路线是沿陇海路至洛阳、西安等地，工作时间约为半年。随行工作单位尚有北京电影制片厂摄影队，及新华书店、三联书店、工人出版社、青年出版社等出版机构合组的流动文化供应站。下面发表的这封信是列车俱乐部写给青年艺术剧院的。从这封信里，我们可以看见铁路员工以及沿线群众是如何欢迎为他们服务的文化工作者。
            编者
                  青年剧院全体同志们：
    我们在三月二十五日晚上八点离开了北京，三十日下午四点抵达我们第一阶段工作目的地——洛阳。
    在行车的五天中，我们为沿线车站上的工人演出了七次，受到了他们亲切的招待与热烈的欢迎。我们抓紧时间虚心的向人民学习。在定县，我们请了对秧歌有经验的农民们来表演和教我们唱歌；在石家庄，我们请了工人剧作者魏连珍同志作报告。
    我们到洛阳的第二天，就投入了紧张的工作热潮中。三十一日的上午请了铁道兵团一支队政治部杨主任作了关于“一支队的情况”的报告。下午我们就动手装台，晚上放映电影。
    四月一日，我们上演了全部小节目，包括《反翻把》、《光荣灯》、《喜报》、《军爱民民拥军》、《老耿赶队》、《胜利腰鼓》。每个节目都引起战士们及老乡们暴风雨似的掌声；台子在原来的飞机库里，拥挤着观众有二千多人。
    四月二日，我们演出的《爱国者》也受到了观众们很大的欢迎，战士们并且要求我们加演节目，指名要《大秧歌》、《送公粮》。我们临时便加演了《大秧歌》和《胜利腰鼓》。
    战士们对我们的欢迎是无可比喻的。他们写欢迎信给我们，并且坚持要我们接收他们送来的猪肉和香烟。驻军一支队的最高首长到车上来参观并慰问我们。战士们常到我们车上的俱乐部来玩，我们也常到技术连、宣传队去玩。技术连的同志们帮助我们拉电线，宣传队的同志们帮我们搭台子。我们请他们提意见，他们说：“只有一个，就是多来，多演！”
    我们的照片，书籍从一日起展览了三天，两间展览室里拥满了战士们！
    四月三日拆了台，俱乐部组织了同志们去洗澡、洗衣服，晚上吃了一顿饺子；战士们都围着我们，舍不得我们走。
    四月四日我们离开洛阳，深入到铁道兵团一支队的一大队中去。在那里我们除了自己学习斯大林同志和毛主席的“共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作”的文件外，全体同志均深入现场及连队中和战士们接近，向战士们学习。
    今天（七日），洛河大桥举行通车典礼（十二年来在日寇和国民党反动派都没有修复的洛河大桥，在我们铁道兵团一支队一大队桥梁大队的全体同志们手上昨天完成了），“文化列车”参加了这次典礼，并第一次驶过这座大桥，我们感到莫大的荣耀！晚上演小戏。我们准备连演四天，十二日离开这里到二十一、廿五大队各工作一周。在一支队的一个月工作就是这样。我们坚信能将工作做好的！
    文化列车到处都受到战士们、工人们和农民们的欢迎，这意味着他们对新文化食粮的需要，也充分的显示毛主席的文艺方向在祖国的文艺战线上的伟大意义！
    此致革命的敬礼！
    铁道部青年文化列车俱乐部全体同志  四月七日
