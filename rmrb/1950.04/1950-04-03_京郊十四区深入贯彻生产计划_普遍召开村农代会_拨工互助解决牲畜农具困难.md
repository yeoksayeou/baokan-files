　　The Fourteen Districts of Beijing Suburbs Thoroughly Implement Production Plans
　　Village Representative Conferences Widely Held
　　Mutual Aid in Labor Allocation Solves Difficulties with Livestock and Farm Tools
　　[Our Newspaper News] After the expanded cadre meeting in the fourteen districts of Beijing suburbs on the 23rd of last month, it was decided to organize work teams to further delve into each village and convey the Beijing suburban production plan. According to investigations, the following problems generally exist in each village: 1. Rich peasants and a small number of wealthy middle peasants are afraid to hire laborers, fearing they will be accused of feudal exploitation and a second land reform struggle. 2. Peasants who have been allocated land fear that the state will take it back, and therefore are hesitant to dig wells and apply fertilizer. 3. Newly emancipated peasants lack production tools, seeds, and fertilizer. The village representative conferences especially discussed the above-mentioned problems; the work teams explained the land reform policy in more detail. Regarding the issue of livestock and farm tools, it was proposed to seek solutions based on the principle of mutual aid. Village cadres in Jixian Village proposed at the meeting: "We cadres should set an example by allocating labor and helping each other." Youth League members in each village have guaranteed that they will not lag behind in allocating labor and helping each other. Farmers in Shibalidian were extremely concerned about increasing production by planting an extra crop per season, and they enthusiastically discussed solutions. Farmer Li Hai proposed: "After the barley harvest, we should plant wide-row corn, and plant kidney beans and cabbage between the ridges." Farmers in Wudian proposed that they must plant more sweet potatoes and cotton this year, which will yield more than planting corn. After this representative conference, the farmers generally recognized the favorable conditions for this year's production, believing that: "If we do not suffer any special disasters this year, increasing production by 10% will definitely not be a problem."

　　京郊十四区深入贯彻生产计划
    普遍召开村农代会   
    拨工互助解决牲畜农具困难
    【本报讯】京郊十四区各村农民代表会普遍开完，农民生产情绪提高，增产一成充满信心。该区于上月二十三日扩大干部会议之后，决定组织工作组进一步深入各村，传达京郊生产计划。据调查，各村一般都存在有下列问题：一、富农及少数富裕中农不敢雇工，怕算封建剥削，怕二次土地改革斗争。二、分得土地的农民怕国家抽回土地，因而打井、施肥上有顾虑。三、新翻身的农民，生产工具及种籽、肥料缺乏。各村农民代表会上特别针对上述问题做了讨论；工作组更详尽地解说了土地改革政策。关于牲畜、农具问题，提出根据互助原则来求得解决。集贤村村干部在会上提出：拨工互助，我们干部们应先做示范。各村青年团员们都保证拨工互助准不落后。十八里店农民对争取多种一季增加产量一事极为关心，曾热烈讨论办法。农民李海提出：大麦收割后应种宽边玉米，在垅间种芸豆及白菜。庑店农民提出今年一定多种白薯与棉花，可较种玉米多收成。经过此次代表会议，农民普遍认识到今年生产的有利条件，认为：今年如不特别遭受灾害，增产一成定没问题。  （十四区赵有福）
