Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw dispatch from Polish Press Agency: The Polish People's Forum newspaper recently published an editorial commenting on the bill to ensure socialist labor discipline recently submitted by the Polish government to the parliament.

The editorial first described the achievements made in the implementation of the six-year economic plan at the beginning of this year, stating: In the first two months of 1950, the electricity production plan was exceeded by 4%, coal production by 4%, woolen fabrics by 9%, cotton fabrics by 4%, tractors by 9%, and the plans for crude steel, cement, and many other raw materials and industrial products were exceeded.

However, while our working class is struggling for over-production and for the timely completion of production tasks, it also condemns and denounces individuals who show negligence and indifference towards work and great tasks; these loafers create many difficulties for the plan to strive for good work. They are often absent from work and drunk, wasting valuable working hours. They cause our coal mining industry to lose a huge amount of coal, and the working hours lost by the cotton textile industry in January alone reached 5.7% of the planned working hours. The working class cannot tolerate loafers remaining in the ranks. At production meetings, workers have expressed indignation and pointed out that it is impossible to obtain extra over-planned products if the losses caused by loafers are not compensated. In view of this, the Polish government has recently submitted a bill to the parliament to guarantee socialist labor discipline, thus realizing the aspirations of the working class.

The implementation and guarantee of labor discipline are completely different from the discipline implemented in the capitalist system that is based on the fear of unemployment. Socialist discipline is a conscious discipline arising from the understanding of being entrusted with glorious and proud tasks. This is our great and fighting task. Those who neglect and disrupt labor discipline without the threat of unemployment will be persuaded by effective methods to consciously respect their responsibilities.

### 改造懒虫提高生产效率  波兰政府实现工人意愿  确立社会主义工作纪律

　　改造懒虫提高生产效率
    波兰政府实现工人意愿  确立社会主义工作纪律
    【新华社十日讯】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰人民论坛报顷发表社论，评论波政府最近提交议会的确保社会主义工作纪律的法案。
    社论首先叙述今年年初执行六年经济计划所获的成就称：在一九五○年头两月当中，电能生产计划已超过了百分之四，煤产计划百分之四，羊毛织物百分之九，棉织物百分之四，拖拉机百分之九，原钢、水泥及其他许多原料和工业产品的计划都被超过了。
    但是，我国工人阶级在为超计划生产、为及时完成生产任务而斗争的同时，也谴责与痛斥了个别对工作与伟大任务表现轻忽与漠不关心的人；这些懒虫给争取良好工作的计划制造了许多困难。他们时时旷工和酗酒，浪费宝贵的工时，他们使我们的采煤工业损失数量巨大的煤斤，而棉织工业所损失的工时，在一月间就达计划工时的百分之五点七。工人阶级不能容忍懒虫留在队伍里，在生产会议上工人们曾表示了愤慨，并指出如不弥补懒虫们所造成的损失，是不可能获得额外的超计划产品的。有鉴于此，波兰政府最近已将保证社会主义工作纪律的法案提交议会，这样实现了工人阶级的意愿。
    实行和保证工作纪律，和资本主义制度实行的那种建基于失业恐惧之上的纪律绝不相同，社会主义纪律是因了解负有光辉与可以骄傲的任务而产生的自觉的纪律，这就是我们的伟大与战斗的任务。对那些在没有失业威胁的情况下，玩忽和破坏工作纪律的人，将以有效的方法进行劝导，以使他们自觉地尊重他们的职责。
