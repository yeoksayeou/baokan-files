The Evil Consequences of the Gratuitous Viewpoint
Wanping Supply and Marketing Work Suffers Losses
More Than Thirty Village Cooperatives Successively Fall into Shutdown; The Tong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Has Taken Appropriate Measures

[Reported by this newspaper] Due to the erroneous gratuitous viewpoint existing at the county level leadership in the Wanping County supply and marketing work in the Tong County Special District of Hebei, the state's assets have suffered considerable losses, and more than thirty village cooperatives in the county have thus fallen into shutdown. The special district leadership has now taken appropriate measures in response.

Wanping is located in a mountainous area, and half of the masses rely on mountain products, operating kilns, and carrying coal for a living. The local supply and marketing cooperative should have made good use of state assets to do a good job in promoting local products, exchanging them for daily necessities, and organizing mass production. However, the county-level leadership of the county had an erroneous gratuitous viewpoint regarding the supply and marketing work. It not only caused considerable losses to state assets, but also failed to benefit the masses as they should have. The county-level leadership, disregarding market production and sales conditions, always wanted to give the masses generous profits. Therefore, in guiding the supply and marketing business, they adopted a high-price purchase method. For example, when purchasing red sticks (for whip handles) last year, they simply started from the idea of "enabling the masses to obtain generous profits" and did not consider sales or prices. They subjectively stipulated that each hundred catties should be purchased at the price of ten catties of millet. If the processing fee, wire binding fee, and transportation fee are added, the cost of transporting them to Chengzizhen, eight miles away from Mentougou, is 26 catties of millet per hundred catties. And one laborer can plane 100 to 300 of these red sticks a day. As a result, the county supply and marketing cooperative purchased 200,000 sticks at once. Twelve million sticks shipped to the Northeast have not yet been sold. During the purchase period, the county leadership did not pay attention to the opinions raised by the supply and marketing cooperative to set up fixed receiving locations, and subjectively insisted on on-site purchase. As a result, large and small mountain gullies were filled with red sticks, wasting a lot of manpower and resources. At that time, private merchants from the Northeast also came to Zhangjia Village in the county to purchase. Seeing that the supply and marketing cooperative was not skilled in this area, they thought they could deceive it, so they took the opportunity to purchase 40,000 high-quality red sticks that the supply and marketing cooperative had already ordered, paid for with rice, and bound with wire, at a slightly higher price. The deputy secretary of the county committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the county said after learning about it: "This is freedom of trade, and it's sold if it's sold!" For example, when collecting anemarrhena (medicinal material) last winter, the purchase price in various places was below three taels of millet per catty, but the county leadership decided to call the supply and marketing cooperative to collect at six taels and five taels of millet per catty. It costs two catties of millet to dry, pack and transport one catty of anemarrhena to Tianjin; while the market price in Tianjin at that time was only one catty of millet. For example, when peanuts were collected last autumn, the county called on the supply and marketing cooperative to collect more than 10,000 catties at a price half higher than the price in Beijing. Also, recently the Tong County Special District Supply and Marketing General Cooperative notified to collect eggs. At that time, the price in Tongzhou Town was only 400 yuan per egg, but the county notified each village to collect one at 400 yuan. Under the influence of the county's consistently high-priced purchase gratuitous viewpoint, the masses have developed an incorrect idea of generous profits. Women are unwilling to do handicrafts of spinning one catty of thread for eight catties of corn, while the average in other disaster areas only requires four to five catties of red sorghum.

In the supply and marketing cooperative itself, there have been no practical organizational cadres for a long time, so the idea of organizing or transforming old cooperatives is very vague. For example: in June of last year, when transforming a village cooperative in the original Fifth District into a district cooperative, the masses were unwilling to change due to concerns. The county cooperative did not start by opening up their minds and mobilizing the masses, but bluntly sent four cadres and invested 10,000 catties of rice as shares. The county cooperative then transferred away the original cadres of the village cooperative. Because the cadres sent were not familiar with the situation and were not good at business, they lost money in six months. By the time of the reorganization in December last year, the masses had withdrawn their shares one after another. The remaining 6,000 catties of millet were the fruits of victory to be distributed to the ten villages whose shares had not been withdrawn. The county cooperative mistakenly distributed the 6,000 catties of millet equally to the ten villages, determined that each household should receive two catties, and asked the masses to pay three catties of rice per household as a share. The masses discussed: "I don't want the two catties of rice, I won't make up the three catties of rice, and I won't be a member of the cooperative." The district cooperative usually treats members and non-members the same, only offering preferential treatment to members (5% discount) for three days of large-scale price reductions at the end of each month. At the beginning of this year, the county held a training class for village cadres, and when talking about supply and marketing cooperatives, it wrongly promoted: "In the future, all cooperatives will be changed to supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives have benefits, do not pay taxes, and the public also assists them." As a result, the villages in the county generally demanded to be changed to supply and marketing cooperatives. At this time, bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors: "Supply means returning to the public, and marketing means eliminating the old cooperatives." The masses panicked and demanded to withdraw their shares and divide the cooperatives. The county government did not think of publicizing and educating, but only ordered: "No division is allowed. Whoever divides is responsible!" The masses used the method of credit arrears to withdraw shares in disguise. The Yanhe Village cooperative owed 18,000 catties of goods, while the actual share capital of the village cooperative was only 25,000 catties of millet. Now all 34 old village cooperatives in the county have successively closed down around the Spring Festival, and individual village cooperatives have been divided by the masses!

After discovering these errors, the Tong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred the work of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, and suggested that the government send the training section chief of the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to restore and develop the county's supply and marketing work.

    恩赐观点的恶果
    宛平供销工作受损失
    三十多个村合作社相继陷于停业中共通县地委对此已采适当措置
    【本报讯】河北通县专区宛平县供销工作，由于县级领导上存在着错误的恩赐观点，致使国家资财遭受不小损失，全县三十余村的合作社亦因而陷于停业，现专区领导上对此已采适当措置。
    宛平地居山区，半数群众，均依靠山货、走窑、背煤为生，该地供销社本应很好使用国家资财，为群众做好推销土产、换回日用必需品及组织群众生产等工作。但该县县级领导对于供销工作却存在着错误的恩赐观点，不但使国家资财受到了相当的损失，而且群众也没有得到应有的好处。该县县级领导，不顾市场产销情况，总想给予群众厚利，因而对供销业务的指导上，就采用了高价收买办法。如去年收买红棍（鞭杆用），即单纯从“使群众获得厚利”出发，并不考虑销路、价格等，主观地规定每百斤按十斤小米收购。如加上加工费、铁丝包扎费、运输费等，运到离门头沟八里地的城子镇，每百斤成本即达二十六斤小米。而此种红棍，一天一个劳动力就能刨一百根到三百根。因此该县供销社一下子即收购了二十万根。运往东北的十二万根，至今仍未能销出。在收购期间，县领导上对供销社所提的设立固定收货地点的意见，并未加以理会，又主观地坚持就地收购。结果大小山沟里都堆满了红棍，浪费了许多人力物力。当时东北私商也来该县张家村收购，见供销社不精此道，以为可欺，便乘机用稍高价格，将供销社已订购下并已付米和用铁丝包扎好的上等红棍收去了四万根。该县中共县委副书记得知后竟说：“这是交易自由，卖了就算卖了！”又如去冬收知母（药材）时，各地收购价每斤均在三两小米以下，该县领导上却决定每斤以六两五小米叫供销社收。一斤知母晒干包装运到天津，成本就达二斤小米；而当时天津市价才一斤小米。再如去秋收花生时，该县以高于北京市价一半的价格叫供销社收了一万多斤。又最近通县专区供销总社通知收鸡蛋，当时通州镇的价格也不过是四百元一个，而该县却通知各村四百元收一个。该县群众在这种一贯以高价收购的恩赐观点的影响下，已养成了不正确的厚利思想。纺一斤线给八斤玉米的手工，妇女们尚不愿做，而其他灾区平均只须四到五斤红高粱。
    在供销社本身，长期没有实际的组社干部，故组社或改造旧社的思想非常模糊。例如：去年六月在改造原五区一个村社为区社时，群众因有顾虑不愿改，县社不从打通思想，发动群众着手，却生硬的派去了四个干部，入了一万斤米的股金，县社又把村社原有的干部调走，派去的干部因不熟悉情况，又不善于经营，六个月功夫就赔了本。至去年十二月进行整理时群众纷纷把股抽出，剩下的六千斤小米，却是没有人抽股的十个村来分配的胜利果实。该县社却又错误地把六千斤小米平均分配给十个村，确定每户二斤，并叫群众每户再缴三斤米算做一股。群众纷纷议论：“二斤米不要了，三斤米不补了，社员不当了。”该区社平日对社员与非社员一律看待，只在每月月底大减价三天算是优待社员（减价百分之五）。今年初县里开办村干训练班，讲到供销社时，错误地宣传：“以后一切合作社都改供销社了，供销社有好处，又不拿税，公家还扶助”。因之该县各村社就普遍要求改为供销社。此时坏分子乘机造谣说：“供就是归公家，销就是消灭旧社”。群众恐慌，于是纷纷要求退股分合作社，县府不想法宣传教育，却只命令说：“一律不许分。谁分谁负责任！”群众即用赊账的变相抽股方式赊，沿河村社一万八千斤米的东西，而该村社实际股本才两万五千斤小米。现全县三十四个旧村社已于春节前后相继停业，个别村社则被群众分了！
    通县专区中共地委发现了这些错误后，已将该县县委正副书记调动工作，并建议政府派遣专区供销社组训科长去恢复并发展该县供销工作。
