　　Nearly 2,000 People Enroll in the First District Workers and Cadres Spare-Time School in Beijing
    [Our Newspaper] Since the preparatory work for the First District Workers and Cadres Regular Spare-Time School in Beijing began on March 14th, a total of 1,952 cadres and workers from the district have registered, including 71 units from public and private factories and government organizations, of which industrial workers account for nine-tenths of the total number. The class assignment work is now underway. There are currently 21 elementary classes and 3 intermediate classes. Shijia Hutong Elementary School, Dengshikou Yuying Middle School, and Waijiaobu Street Datong Middle School have been designated as classrooms for each class. Among them, nine elementary classes, totaling 398 people, started classes on March 26th. Another 653 people will start classes within this week. The remaining 700 to 800 people will also undergo class assignment testing. The students who have already started classes have automatically organized service teams to solve the problem of bicycle parking and the difficulty of students finding classrooms when classes begin. Generally, students can arrive at school on time. Now, each group is brewing the formulation of learning covenants. The students' enthusiasm for learning is very high. (Zhang Wei)
