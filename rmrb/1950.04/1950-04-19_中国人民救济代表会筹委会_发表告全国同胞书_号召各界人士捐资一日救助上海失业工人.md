The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Relief Representative Conference has issued a letter to the nation to provide relief to unemployed workers in Shanghai and other cities. The full text is as follows:

After reading the letter from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions calling for national workers to help and relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai, and the speech by Mao Qihua, Deputy Minister of Labor of the Central People's Government, on providing relief to unemployed workers in Shanghai, we express our deep sympathy to the unemployed workers and their families in Shanghai and other cities. We immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee today and unanimously decided to call on people from all walks of life across the country to enthusiastically respond to this mutual aid and relief campaign.

The workers of Shanghai were very brave in the anti-imperialist and anti-Chiang struggle. Especially before and after liberation, they made indelible contributions in protecting factories, supporting the army, vying to purchase Victory Bonds, and restoring production. Now, due to the blockade and bombing by the US imperialists and Chiang bandits, some areas have suffered from natural disasters, and the purchasing power of the people has temporarily declined. Industrial and commercial enterprises that relied on inflationary speculation have closed down due to price stability, resulting in a sudden increase in the number of unemployed workers and their families in Shanghai, and their lives have become difficult. The same phenomenon exists in cities such as Hankou and Nanjing. Although this unemployment situation is a temporary transition, it can be gradually improved after the liberation of Taiwan, the realization of land reform in various provinces, and the recovery and development of agriculture and industry. However, their current practical difficulties must be resolved immediately. Therefore, this committee calls on people from all walks of life to follow the example of workers in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and other places who are generously donating one day's wages, and voluntarily donate one day's income to help unemployed workers and their parents, wives and children overcome their difficulties. We should have compassion for those who are drowning or hungry, promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe, mutual assistance and mutual relief, and help our unemployed worker brothers and sisters tide over their current difficulties peacefully. At the same time, we must work hard to support the Liberation Army, completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and strive for the early success of the New Democratic economic construction. Only in this way can the phenomenon of worker unemployment be gradually eliminated in the New China.

　　中国人民救济代表会筹委会
    发表告全国同胞书
    号召各界人士捐资一日救助上海失业工人
    【新华社十八日讯】中国人民救济代表会议筹备委员会为救济上海及其他城市失业工人，顷发表告全国同胞书，全文如下：
    在读了上海总工会致中华全国总工会呼吁全国工人互助救济上海失业工人的信，和中央人民政府劳动部毛齐华副部长关于救济上海失业工人的谈话后，我们对上海与其他城市的失业工人及其家属们，寄予深切的同情，并即于今日召开了常委紧急会议，一致决定号召全国各界人士都来热烈响应这一互助救济运动。
    上海的工人在反帝反蒋斗争中非常英勇，尤其是在解放前后在护厂、劳军、争购胜利公债和恢复生产等方面，都有不可磨灭的功绩。现在因为美帝蒋匪的封锁轰炸，部分地区遭受灾荒，人民购买力暂时低落，素靠通货膨胀发投机财的工商业因物价稳定而歇业，致上海失业工人及其家属人数骤然增多，他们的生活也发生了困难。汉口、南京等城市也有同样现象。这一失业情况虽是暂时的过渡现象，等到台湾解放，各省土地改革实现，农业工业都已恢复发展后，就可以逐渐得到改善，但是他们目前的实际困难必须立予解决。因此，本会号召各界人士，都向上海、北京、天津等地在业工人乐捐一天工资的义举看齐，也自愿的捐助一天所得，救助失业工人及其父母妻子们渡过苦难。我们应本己溺己饥的同情心，发扬同甘共苦互助互济的精神，帮助失业的工人弟兄们平安渡过目前的困难。同时，我们要努力工作，支援解放大军，彻底消灭蒋匪残余，争取新民主主义经济建设的早日成功。只有这样，工人失业现象才能在新中国逐步被消灭。

                                                  四月十八日
