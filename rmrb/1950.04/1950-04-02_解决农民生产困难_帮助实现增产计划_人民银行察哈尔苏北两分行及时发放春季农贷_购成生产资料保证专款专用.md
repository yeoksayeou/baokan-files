    People's Bank of China, Chahar and Subei Sub-branches, Promptly Issue Spring Agricultural Loans
    Purchasing Production Materials to Ensure Dedicated Use
    Chahar Issues 25.5 Million Jin of Grain Loans
    [Our Dispatch] To realize the Chahar Province's 1950 agricultural production plan to increase grain by 3 million shi, the People's Bank of China, Chahar Branch, has issued 25.5 million jin of spring grain loans. In order to ensure that the grain loans are truly used for their intended purpose, the bank has adopted the method of purchasing or organizing various production materials through special and county banks and supply and marketing cooperatives to loan to farmers. It has been determined that newly emancipated poor peasants and farm laborers should be given more consideration to help them become rich through labor. In accordance with the government's agricultural production plan, the priorities for use are: A. 6 million jin for farmland water conservancy loans, used in the Chahar South, Yanbei, and Chahar North areas, with the focus on supporting small and medium-sized canal construction and well-digging. B. 2 million jin for agricultural tool loans, used in Chahar South, Chahar North, and Yanbei, with the method of using supply and marketing cooperatives to manufacture and purchase, then lending or selling. C. 3 million jin for breeding livestock loans, used in Chahar South, Yanbei, and Chahar North, with the emphasis on breeding, purchasing breeding livestock from Inner Mongolia or Suiyuan through supply and marketing cooperatives or organized farmers. D. 12.5 million jin for water conservancy project loans, used for the three major state-owned canals in Yanbei, used under the plan and control of the Water Conservancy Bureau. E. 2 million jin for pesticide and alcohol loans, purchased uniformly by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and distributed to various places for lending or selling. F. 1.49 million jin for chicken hatching loans, used in Chahar South, Yanbei, Chahar North, Zhangjiakou and other areas, lent out through the turnover of business funds in various places and industries. Other draft animals and seeds are planned and resolved by each bank and office according to the actual situation and surplus financial strength in each place. The above totals 25.5 million jin (excluding chicken hatching loans).
    In order to facilitate the progress of agricultural loan work, the sub-branch, in accordance with the regulations of the head office and the government's agricultural policies, has drafted "Draft Regulations for Handling Agricultural and Sideline Product Loans" and "Draft Procedures for the Receipt and Payment of Grain Loans," distributing them to each bank and office for research and implementation, in order to clarify the understanding of agricultural loan work and establish a strict working system.
    According to reports from various localities, after the loans were issued, the business departments and cooperative sub-offices of each sub-branch purchased 16,430 iron shovels from Yangquan through the Provincial Cooperative (6,000 have been shipped back), 40,500 plowshares from Yangquan and Changzhi, 47,000 jin of arsenic from Hankou, and 270,000 jin of alcohol from Zhangjiakou Enterprise Company (180,000 jin have been shipped to Chahar North). All iron shovels and alcohol are used in Chahar North. Plowshares are used in Chahar South and Chahar North. Arsenic is used in the three special districts of Chahar North, Chahar South, and Yanbei. 113,900 jin of grain loans were lent to the Agricultural Department for hatching chickens, purchasing 10 incubators and 40,000 eggs. 20,000 jin of millet was lent to farmers in the four districts of Zhangjiakou, purchasing 10,000 jin of Chinese yam seeds. There are also castor seeds, corn seeds, arsenic, etc. The Duolun branch used 80,000 jin of loan rice through the supply and marketing cooperative to order nearly 3,000 pieces of plowshares, plow ears, wooden plows, iron shovels, iron plows, hoes, lassos, and plows for opening land. The Baoyuan branch lent out 13 million yuan of livestock loans, requiring the purchase of more than 100 head of breeding livestock. Other Weixian and Shangdu branches have also purchased a batch of seeds and agricultural tools through the supply and marketing cooperatives with loan grain. The Huailai branch used 92,800 jin of loan grain combined with 125,310 jin of private capital to plan to dig a total of 557 earth wells, brick wells, and stone wells. In January, it also used more than 2,000 jin of loan grain to help the masses burn asphalt, and 41,395 jin of loan grain to order a large number of tools such as iron shovels, hoes, and sickles. The Wanquan branch lent out 54,000 jin of grain for draft animal loans, purchasing 64 head of draft animals; lent out 80,000 jin of manure and 60,000 jin of sesame cakes. It also supported the farm tool factory to order 2,500 iron shovels with 23,000 jin of loan rice and 5 million yuan through the supply and marketing cooperative, and lent 400 jin of millet to casting plowshare households, nailing 1,000 plowshares.
