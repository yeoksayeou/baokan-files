　　Ministry of Interior Issues Instructions
    Helping Relocate Some Disaster Victims from Severely Affected Areas or Repatriate Fleeing Disaster Victims to Their Hometowns for Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government has issued instructions regarding helping to relocate some disaster victims from severely affected areas or repatriate them to their hometowns for production. The instructions point out: The main focus in disaster areas should be on mobilizing the masses for self-salvation through production, enabling disaster victims to be resettled locally. However, for certain severely affected areas where agricultural production is impossible within two to three years, or where the foundation for sideline production is weak, making local resettlement truly difficult and requiring relocation, local governments should issue certificates for relocation and provide appropriate care. The issuance of certificates must be done cautiously to avoid encouraging blind flight from famine among disaster victims.
    The instructions stipulate: When repatriating fleeing disaster victims to their hometowns for production, it must be done on a voluntary basis, in an organized and timely manner. If the original hometown is still flooded and unable to engage in agricultural production, they should be transported to areas with available land for cultivation or resettled through social mutual assistance. Disaster victims relocating or returning to their hometowns for production are generally granted a 40% discount on train tickets. Those who genuinely cannot afford the travel expenses may receive subsidies according to the following methods: (1) Ordinary subsidy: The government pays 40% of the train fare. (2) Special subsidy: In addition to the ordinary subsidy, a living allowance will be provided based on the distance traveled, but not exceeding one jin of millet per person per day. The instructions also stipulate: Disaster victims relocating or returning to their hometowns for production should, as much as possible, travel in groups with assigned leaders to facilitate transportation. For individuals, the Railway Bureau will uniformly issue preferential travel certificates, which relevant governments can obtain from nearby Railway Administrations for use.

　　内务部发布指示
    帮助重灾区部分灾民外移或遣送外逃灾民回乡生产
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府内务部发出关于帮助重灾区部分灾民外移或回乡生产的指示。指示指出：各灾区主要是发动群众生产自救，使灾民就地得以安置，但对某些重灾地区二三年内无法从事农业生产或副业生产基础薄弱，就地安置确有困难必须外移者，各地政府应发给证明进行外移，并予以适当照顾。在发给证明时必须慎重，以免助长灾民盲目逃荒现象。
    指示规定：在遣送外逃灾民回乡生产时，必须在自愿原则下有组织地及时遣送，若原籍积水仍不能从事农业生产者，应输送到有荒可垦地区进行生产或从开展社会互济中予以安置。灾民外移或回乡生产一般准予四成购票乘车，对确无法自筹路费者得按下列办法进行补助：（一）普通补助：由政府支付四成车费。（二）特别补助：除按普通补助外，并按路程酌情补助生活费，但每人每日不得超过小米一斤。指示并规定：灾民外移或回乡生产应尽量集体行动，着人带领，以利运送；若属零星者由铁路局统一制定乘车优待证，各有关政府可向附近铁路管理局领取使用。
