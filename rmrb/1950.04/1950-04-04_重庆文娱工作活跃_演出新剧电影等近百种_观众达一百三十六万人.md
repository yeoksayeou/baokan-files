　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: The literary and art work groups of the People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Municipal Cultural Troupe, in coordination with various propaganda efforts in the three and a half months after the liberation of Chongqing, especially around the Spring Festival, carried out mass cultural and entertainment activities, achieving good results. A total of 96 kinds of dramas, songs, dances, and movies were performed, reaching an audience of more than 1.36 million people. The performance programs included: operas "The White Haired Girl," "Wang Xiuluan," "Liu Hulan," spoken drama "Conscripting Soldiers," Peking opera "Nine Pieces of Clothing," "Huang Chao," "Lian Po and Lin Xiangru," etc., totaling 76 kinds. 180 performances were staged, of which 25 were performed in squares, with an audience of about 720,000 workers, soldiers, students, citizens, and farmers from the suburbs. Films such as "The Bridge," "The Birth of New China," "A Million Brave Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "Danya," "Michurin," etc., totaling 20 kinds, were screened 570 times, with some screenings held in factories and suburbs, reaching an audience of about 600,000 people. These programs were warmly welcomed by the citizens of Chongqing. After the performance of "The White Haired Girl," the supplement of the Xinhua Daily held a symposium, receiving a large number of submissions, which unanimously agreed that after watching the play, they had a deeper understanding of the evils of the old society, making their determination to struggle even stronger. The performance of "The Bridge" particularly aroused the enthusiasm of the workers. Li Guangrui, a worker at the Chongqing Power Company, wrote: "’The Bridge’ has given us too much inspiration and education. We must be more courageous in the future. Everyone should learn from Lao Liang, quickly complete the factory repair, restore production, and strengthen unity to strive for large-scale production increases. We must produce countless Lao Liangs in future construction work." Workers at the woolen mill automatically processed goods after watching the opera "Wang Xiuluan." All literary and art work groups went deep into factories, schools, and among the citizens. People were sent to factories and troops within 40 li around Chongqing to help them develop cultural and entertainment activities. Under this influence, the old theaters in Chongqing also began to rehearse new scripts, successively performing "Blood and Tears of Vengeance," "The White Haired Girl," "Nine Pieces of Clothing," and others. The audience's demand for literary and art with new content is very urgent. The Peking Opera troupe's performance of "Huang Chao" was originally scheduled for three days, but at the request of the audience, it was extended for another week. Audiences as far away as Jiangbei County also wrote requesting additional matinee performances. The Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Region and the Municipal Cultural Troupe are now performing the spoken drama "Victory Crossing the Yangtze River" and "Red Flag Song." In the past three and a half months, new cultural and entertainment activities have been widely promoted and developed among the masses.

    【新华社讯】重庆消息：人民解放军西南军区驻重庆的部队文艺工作团体和重庆市文工团，在重庆解放后的三个半月内，配合历次宣传工作，特别是春节前后，开展了群众性的文化娱乐活动，得到很好的成绩。前后共演出戏剧、歌曲、舞蹈和电影九十六种，观众达一百三十六万余人。演出节目包括：歌剧：《白毛女》、《王秀鸾》、《刘胡兰》，话剧：《抓壮丁》，京剧：《九件衣》、《黄巢》、《廉颇蔺相如》等七十六种；共演出了一百八十场，其中二十五场是在广场演出的，观众工人、部队、学生、市民、近郊农民约七十二万人。影片《桥》、《新中国的诞生》、《百万雄师下江南》、《丹娘》、《米邱林》等二十种，共放映五百七十次，其中若干场是到各工厂、市郊放映的，观众约六十万人。这些节目，受到重庆市民热烈的欢迎。《白毛女》演出以后，新华日报副刊举行了一次笔谈，收到大批稿件，一致认为：看了这个戏，对于旧社会的罪恶，有了更深刻的认识，使斗争的决心更为坚定。《桥》的演出，特别引起工人们的振奋。重庆电力公司的工人李光瑞写道：“‘桥’给我们的启发和教育太大了，我们今后要更加鼓起勇气，大家学习老梁，迅速完成修复工厂，恢复生产的工作，更要加强团结，努力地做到大量增产，要在今后建设工作中产生无数的老梁。”织呢厂工人看了歌剧《王秀鸾》后，自动加工。各文艺工作团体都深入工厂、学校、市民中间去，凡是在重庆市区周围四十里路以内的工厂、部队，都派了人去帮助他们开展文化娱乐活动。重庆市原来的旧剧院在这种影响下，也纷纷排演新剧本，先后演出了“血泪仇”、“白毛女”、“九件衣”等。观众对于新内容的文艺要求十分迫切。京剧队演出《黄巢》原定三天，后经观众要求，又续演了一个星期，远在江北县的观众也来信要求加演日场。军区政治部文工团和市文工团现正上演话剧《胜利渡长江》和《红旗歌》。三个半月来，新的文化娱乐活动在群众中间已得到广泛的推动和开展。
