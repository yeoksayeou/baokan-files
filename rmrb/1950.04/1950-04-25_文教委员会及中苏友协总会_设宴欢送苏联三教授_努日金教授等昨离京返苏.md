　　The Cultural and Educational Committee and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters
    Hold a Banquet to See Off Three Soviet Professors
    Professor Nurzhin and Others Left Beijing Yesterday to Return to the Soviet Union
Xinhua News Agency, 23rd -- Three Soviet professors, including Dr. Nurzhin (biology), Dr. Giselev (history), and Ms. Makarova (economics), who were invited by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters to lecture in China, have completed their lectures in various parts of the country and are scheduled to return to the Soviet Union within days. The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters held a farewell banquet on the 22nd. Attendees included Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters; Ma Xulun, Lu Dingyi, and Shen Yanbing, Deputy Directors of the Cultural and Educational Committee; Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters; heads of various ministries, departments, and bureaus under the Cultural and Educational Committee; and more than 60 experts in biology, history, and economics. Federin and Chikhvin, counselors of the Soviet Embassy, and Xie Liejin, representative of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, were also invited to attend. Guo Moruo delivered a farewell speech, saying that the three Soviet scholars had held more than 100 lectures and symposiums in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Luoyang, and other places. They imparted Marxism-Leninism and valuable Soviet experience to us. In addition to expressing our deep gratitude to them, we will take the most resolute action to ensure the realization of everything they have imparted to us. The profound friendship of the three professors for the Chinese people will forever remain in the hearts of the Chinese people. The arrival of the three professors in our country is even more due to Marshal Stalin's concern for the Chinese people. In his reply, Dr. Nurzhin said: We have seen in our lectures in various places that the Chinese people are engaged in building a free and happy new life with a victorious spirit. Imperialists are trying to lead the world into a new war, and we should strive for lasting world peace. Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are active participants in the struggle for peace, and the great victory of the Chinese people is the most powerful blow to the instigators of new wars. Dr. Nurzhin's speech was interrupted by warm applause. At the meeting, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Cultural and Educational Committee presented gifts to the three professors. Finally, the Central Academy of Drama and the Beijing Opera Institute performed entertainment programs.
[This newspaper] Report: Soviet professors Nurzhin, Giselev, and Makarova left Beijing by train yesterday (24th) at 9 pm to return to their country.
