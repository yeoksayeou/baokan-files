　　Seize the Season and Hasten Tree Planting
    Qingming has arrived. The period around Qingming is the good season for planting trees. This spring, we must plant trees on a large scale, and everyone should strive to plant and keep alive one or two easily surviving trees (such as willows, etc.).
    In the past, some people said that planting trees depends on fate, that only those with a "water" fate can keep them alive, and that those with other fates cannot. This is superstition.
    Generally speaking, willows are relatively easy to keep alive. When planting willows, it is necessary to achieve "deep planting and firm tamping," which means that the pit should be dug about one and a half feet deep, and when filling the pit, effort should be made to tamp it firmly. Otherwise, it will dry out and die when exposed to the sun and wind.

　　抓紧季节  赶快植树
    清明到了。清明前后正是植树的好时节，在今年春天要大量植树，每人应争取栽活一、二棵易活的树（如杨柳树等）。
    过去有些人说栽树论命啦，水命能栽活，其他命都不行，这是迷信话。
    杨柳树一般说来比较容易栽活的。栽杨柳树时，要作到“深栽实捣”，就是说窟要挖到一尺半深上下，在填窟时再出力捣实，否则太阳一晒和风一吹，就会干死了。
