　　The People of Korea and Mongolia Warmly Respond to the Grand Appeal
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch] The World Peace Congress Standing Committee's peace appeal has received a warm response from the people of Korea and Mongolia. Pyongyang dispatch: Han Sorya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, stated on the 20th that people from all walks of life in Korea unanimously support the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal and are launching a signature campaign throughout the country. We have printed 400,000 copies of the appeal and 500,000 signature sheets for this purpose. Han Sorya emphasized that, in Korea, this peace signature campaign is closely linked to the struggle against the American imperialists' colonial policy in South Korea and the conspiracies of their tool of aggression—the "United Nations Commission on Korea"—and to overthrowing the traitorous Syngman Rhee bandit gang.
　　According to TASS, Ulan Bator dispatch: The Mongolian National Committee for the Defense of Peace held its second meeting on April 20th, the anniversary of the World Peace Congress, and resolved to endorse the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to ban atomic weapons and declare the first government to use atomic weapons a war criminal. It also decided to establish local peace committees in the central areas of the Mongolian People's Republic, major enterprises, and state-owned farms.

　　朝鲜与蒙古两国人民热烈响应和大呼吁书
    【新华社二十三日讯】世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的和平呼吁书已获得朝鲜与蒙古人民的热烈响应。平壤消息：朝鲜拥护和平全国委员会委员长韩雪野二十日发表谈话称：朝鲜各阶层人民一致拥护世界和大常委会的呼吁书，并在全国范围内展开了签名运动。我们为此已印了呼吁书四十万份，签名纸五十万份。韩雪野强调指出：在朝鲜，这个和平签名运动是和反对美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民政策及其侵略工具——“联合国朝鲜委员会”的阴谋、与打倒李承晚卖国匪帮的斗争密切地联系着的。
    另据塔斯社乌兰巴托尔讯：蒙古拥护和平全国委员会于四月二十日世界和大召开周年纪念日举行第二次会议，决议拥护世界和大常委会号召禁止原子武器并宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战犯的呼吁书，并决定在蒙古共和国各区中心、各大企业和国营农场中，成立地方和平委员会。
