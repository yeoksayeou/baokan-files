　　Letter of Correction
    In the news item published on the 6th of this month regarding the more than 2,000 industrial and commercial households in Beijing having paid their taxes (Note: published on this paper's June 6th edition), the last paragraph stated that the Tax "Fifth Branch Bureau" convened two mobilization meetings. This is an error, it should have been the "Second Branch Bureau".
