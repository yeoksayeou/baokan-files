　　The Ministry of Finance and the Central Taxation Bureau
    Send Personnel to Inspect Tax Work in Central and Southern China
    After Arriving in Wuhan, They Departed for Hunan and Guangdong Provinces
    [Hankou News] The group of more than ten personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Taxation Bureau of the Central People's Government departed from Beijing on April 5th, arrived in Wuhan on the 7th, and left Wuhan for Hunan and Guangdong provinces on the 15th. The purpose of this trip is to inspect and assist in tax work. During their stay in Wuhan, they gained an in-depth understanding of the tax work in Wuhan City and Hubei Province through methods such as interviews, meetings, and conducting investigations from both direct and indirect angles. They also worked with staff from the Central and Southern China Tax Administration Bureau to practically participate in the collection of the spring industrial and commercial tax in Wuhan City. They carefully studied and analyzed the collection methods of the spring industrial and commercial tax in Wuhan City, gave them a correct evaluation, and provided valuable opinions. In addition, they also conducted a few days of inspection on the tax work in the Xiaogan Special District of Hubei, and found that the assessed collection of commodity tax was quite different from its actual output, resulting in significant tax evasion, which is a loss to the national fiscal revenue. Remedial action should be taken quickly.

　　财政部及中央税务总局
    派员检查中南税收工作
    抵汉检查后已赴湘粤各省
    【汉口讯】中央人民政府财政部及中央税务总局所派十余人员，于四月五日自北京起程，七日抵汉，十五日离汉赴湘粤各省。此行目的为检查与帮助税收工作。在武汉停留期间，他们以谈话、开会及正面、侧面进行调查等方式，深入的了解了武汉市及湖北省的税收工作情况并配合中南税务管理局工作人员实际参加武汉市春季工商业税的征收工作。他们对武汉市春季工商业税的征收方法，进行了仔细的研究分析，给以正确的评价，并提供了可贵的意见。此外对湖北孝感专区税收工作也进行了几天检查，发现货物税的查定征收部分与其实际产量颇有悬殊，漏税不少，在国家财政收入上是一个损失。应迅速补救。
