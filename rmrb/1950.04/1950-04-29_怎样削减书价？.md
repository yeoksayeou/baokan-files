How to Reduce Book Prices?
    According to the recent survey of readers' opinions by the Jiangxi Provincial Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, most readers believe that the current prices of books and periodicals published by state publishing houses are too high, especially those published by the Central and Southern General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore in Wuhan.

    Why do readers have such a reaction? This is because:

    First, since March, prices across the country have generally fallen, but the multiples used for book and periodical sales at that time have not fallen accordingly.

    Second, the general situation of prices across the country is that major cities are higher than general cities, and general cities are higher than counties and rural areas (based on the gold yuan deposit exchange rate, Beijing is about 80 to 85 percent higher than Nanchang). Book and periodical prices are determined based on the cost of materials in the place of publication (major cities). Therefore, when books and periodicals are distributed to the interior, their prices are relatively high (for example, a book that can be bought with one gold yuan deposit unit in Beijing requires 1.8 units in Nanchang).

    Another issue related to the high book prices is the inconsistent pricing of publishing houses in different regions. Taking the prices of Xinhua editions from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou currently sold in Nanchang as an example, the Hankou edition is the most expensive, followed by the Beijing edition, and the Shanghai edition is the cheapest (the price of the Hankou Xinhua edition is as much as 100 percent higher than that of the Shanghai Xinhua edition). Although Shanghai's printing conditions are more advanced than Hankou's, and paper is cheaper, Shanghai's general prices are about 40 percent higher than Hankou's (according to the gold yuan deposit exchange rates in the two places). Combining the two, the cost difference between the two places should not be too large, and the significant difference in book and periodical prices may also be due to differences in calculating costs, profits, and management and expenses.

    Currently, the purchasing power of the people is generally low. If the pricing of publications cannot appropriately take this into account, it will seriously reduce sales figures and affect the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and the popularization of culture.

    Secondly, because the pricing of publications varies from region to region, the business of publishing houses in various regions will be difficult to develop in a balanced way. For example, Nanchang is within the business scope of the Central and Southern region, but given the high prices of the Hankou Xinhua edition, private bookstores here have recently begun to establish contacts with Shanghai bookstores. This will inevitably affect the development of the Central and Southern Xinhua Bookstore's business.

    In response to these situations, I believe that state publishing houses must achieve the following points on the issue of book and periodical pricing:

    1. Strive for the scientific and enterprise-oriented management, carefully budget, minimize waste, reduce costs, and ensure that book and periodical pricing is appropriate and reasonable, so as to avoid unnecessary burdens on readers.

    2. Profits should not be too high. According to the author's investigation and research, for some books, based on their selling price, even if they are printed in Nanchang, where printing conditions are extremely backward, the cost is only about 20 to 30 percent of the selling price, that is, the profit exceeds 200 percent. This is unreasonable.

    3. For the printing of books and periodicals, it is best to use paper molds as much as possible and send them to various places for printing. Pricing should also be determined according to the price situation in each place. In this way, not only can the difference between book prices and prices be eliminated, but also the transportation trouble and postage can be reduced (the latter is also related to the burden on readers). At the same time, local paper produced in places like Jiangxi can also be fully utilized.

### 怎样削减书价？

　　怎样削减书价？
    根据新华书店江西省分店最近征求读者意见的结果，多数读者认为目前国家出版机关书刊售价太高，尤以武汉新华书店中南总分店的出版品为最。
    为什么读者会有这样的反应呢？这是因为：
    第一、从三月以来，全国物价都普遍下跌，但当时书刊发售的倍数，并未相应下跌。
    第二、全国物价的一般情形是：各主要城市较一般城市为高，一般城市较各县及农村为高（以折储牌价为标准，北京较南昌约高百分之八十至八十五左右），书刊的售价都是按出版地（各主要城市）的物价成本决定的，因此书刊发行到内地，其价目便相对的提高（比如在北京一个折实单位分可以买到的书，到南昌便要一·八个单位了）。
    与上述书价太高有关的另一个问题，便是各地出版机关的定价不统一。就目前南昌所出售的北京、上海、汉口三地新华版的定价言，以汉口版最贵，北京版次之，上海版最低（汉口新华版的定价比上海新华版有高达百分之一百者）。虽然上海的印刷条件比汉口较进步，纸张较便宜，但上海的一般物价则比汉口约高百分之四十（根据两地的折储牌价）。两者结合起来，两地的成本相差应不致太远，而书刊定价的高低悬殊，可能还有计算成本、利润，以及管理、开支等方面的差别。
    目前，人民的购买力一般都很低，出版品的定价如不能适当的照顾到这一点，便会严重地减低销售数字，影响马列主义与毛泽东思想的传播和文化的普及。
    其次，由于各地出版品的定价不统一，各地出版机关的业务，就很难获得平衡的发展。比方南昌是在中南区的业务范围以内，但鉴于汉口新华版的定价过高，这里的私营书店，近来便纷纷与上海书店建立往来了。这就不免要影响中南新华书店业务的发展。
    针对这些情形，我以为目前国家出版机关，在书刊定价问题上，必须做到下列各点：
    一、力求管理工作的科学化、企业化，精打细算，尽量避免浪费，减低成本，使书刊定价做到适当与合理，以免读者不必要的负担。
    二、利润不应过高。据作者调查研究，有的书本，按它的售价，即在印刷条件极其落后的南昌付印，成本也只及售价百分之二十至三十左右，亦即利润超过了百分之二百以上。这是不合理的。
    三、书刊的印刷，最好多多运用纸型，分寄各地付印。定价亦按各地的物价情形决定。这样，不但可以消除书价与物价的差别，而且可以减少运输上的麻烦和邮寄费（后者亦与读者负担有关）。同时，像江西所出的土产纸，亦可以得到充分利用的机会。
