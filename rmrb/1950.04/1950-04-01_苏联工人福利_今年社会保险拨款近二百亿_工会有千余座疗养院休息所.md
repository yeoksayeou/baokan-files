　　Soviet Workers' Welfare
    Nearly 20 Billion Allocated to Social Insurance This Year; Trade Unions Have Over a Thousand Sanatoriums and Rest Homes
    In the Soviet Union, allocations for social insurance were 8.6 billion rubles in 1940, reached 17 billion rubles in 1949, and this year, this allocation will exceed 19 billion rubles.
    Before the war, Soviet trade unions owned nearly 900 sanatoriums and rest homes; now, trade unions own 1,148 sanatoriums, rest homes, and hospitals. Last year, 2.1 million people went for recuperation and treatment.
    Members of the Leningrad Oblast Machine and Tool Manufacturing Workers' Union, in addition to their annual income, can also receive funds from the social insurance fund almost equal to their average monthly salary. Last year, 3,000 employees from the twelve enterprises affiliated with the union went to sanatoriums and rest homes for recuperation. In the past two years, the union's employees have built well-equipped housing covering an area of 21,000 square meters.
    The Leningrad Oblast Committee of the Soviet Textile Workers' Union has a social insurance fund budget of 50 million rubles this year. Throughout the year, 5,000 textile workers will go to resorts for vacation at no cost. A portion of the fund will be allocated specifically for renovating housing for elderly female workers. Pregnant textile workers will receive subsidies totaling 4 million rubles. Allocations for textile workers' children in Young Pioneer summer camps will exceed 3 million rubles.
    During the post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Ministry of Railways built dormitories for railway workers with an area of over 2 million square meters. Tens of thousands of railway workers have received assistance from state loans to build their own homes. This year, the social insurance fees for the Central Railway Workers' Union have increased by 340 million rubles compared to last year. Currently, highly skilled railway workers in the transportation industry who are over 50 years old and have worked for more than 20 years can receive an additional subsidy of 50% of their basic salary.
    The Soviet coal mining areas have more than 650 clubs and cultural palaces, and more than 700 libraries with 3 million books.
    Last year, public health expenditures in the Soviet Byelorussian Republic totaled more than 678 million rubles. In the western states of the republic, there are now a total of 274 hospitals.
    The Moldavian Republic has allocated a large amount of funds for subsidies to mothers with many children and single mothers; currently, 46,000 mothers are receiving subsidies. In the post-war years alone, 245 million rubles have been paid to them.
