Xinhua News Agency, Yangzhou, 1st: The Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office held a water conservancy conference at the end of last month and formulated this year's water management plan. The plan determined that the general principle of water management in the Northern Jiangsu area this year is: vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to prevent floods and defend against tides, drain accumulated water, and safely pass the flood season; at the same time, combine this with the reconnaissance and research of fundamental projects. According to this principle, the Administrative Office stipulated that the water management tasks for the entire area this year are: (1) Continue to complete the Yi River guidance project from Zhangshan to Linhongkou, releasing all the Shu River into the sea; (2) Repair breaches and restore embankments on the Grand Canal, focusing on heightening and thickening to ensure that the dikes do not collapse when the flood reaches the highest water level of 1931 this year; (3) Focus on reinforcing dangerous sections of the Yangtze River dikes and necessary dike retreat, while also mobilizing the masses to reinforce branch dikes; (4) Dredge the main silted river channels in the inland rivers, and at the same time mobilize the masses to build embankments and dig ditches to develop farmland irrigation projects; (5) Continue to build sea dikes in the cotton reclamation area and dredge the main rivers leading to the sea.

According to the above tasks, the plan specifically stipulates that the spring repair project in Northern Jiangsu this spring will focus on guiding the Yi River and developing land, combined with the key reinforcement of the Yangtze River dikes and the Grand Canal dikes, and the continued excavation of the Tangyu River and other projects. All spring repair projects are required to complete more than 68.253 million cubic meters of earthwork, and 6,400 cubic meters of fascine and stonework, requiring the mobilization and organization of more than 697,000 civilian workers (an average of 40 days of work per person in good weather). In order to carry out the above tasks, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office decided to allocate more than 245.6 million catties of grain to implement work-for-relief, closely combining production and disaster relief, so that the disaster victims can get through the spring famine.

The large-scale spring Yi River guidance project stipulated in the plan officially started in full swing in early March. 300,000 civilian workers from ten counties including Shuyang, Xin'an, Siyang, Suining, Guanyun, Huaiyin, Suqian, and Lianshui are working hard on the 400-li Yi River line. This spring's Yi River guidance project involves a total of 27 million cubic meters of earthwork, and 22 percent of the entire project has now been completed. Guanyun County has completed an average of 35 percent, and Shuyang County has completed 43.5 percent. Some dike repair teams have completed more than 70 days of work in just ten days.

　　苏北制定治水计划
    防洪挡潮排除积水
    今春实行以工代赈导沂兴垦
    【新华社扬州一日电】苏北人民行政公署于上月底召开水利会议，制定了今年的治水计划。该计划决定今年苏北区的治水总方针是：大力发动与组织群众，防洪挡潮，排除积水，安渡汛期；同时并联系治本工程的勘察与研究。根据这一方针，行署规定今年全区治水任务为：（一）继续完成嶂山至临洪口导沂工程，放全部沭水入海；（二）运河堵口复堤，是有重点地进行加高培厚，确保今年洪水达到一九三一年最高洪水位时，不使河堤溃决；（三）有重点地培修长江堤险段和必要的退堤，同时发动群众培修支堤；（四）疏通内河主要淤塞河道，同时并发动群众筑圩挖沟，兴办农田灌溉工程；（五）继续修筑棉垦区海堤及疏通通海各主要河道。
    按照上述的任务，计划具体规定今春苏北的春修工程以导沂兴垦为重心，结合进行长江堤、运河堤的重点培修及继续唐豫河等的开凿工程，全部春修工程要求完成土工六千八百二十五万三千余公方土，埽工、石工六千四百立方公尺，共需动员组织六十九万七千余民工（平均每人做四十个晴天工）。为执行上述任务，苏北行署决定拨粮二亿四千五百六十余万斤，实行以工代赈，密切结合生产救灾，使灾民渡过春荒。
    计划中规定的规模巨大的春季导沂工程已于三月上旬全面动工。沭阳、新安、泗阳、睢宁、灌云、淮阴、宿迁、涟水等十县三十万民工，正在四百华里的沂河线上，从事紧张的劳动。今春导沂工程共二千七百万公方土，现已完成全部工程的百分之二十二，灌云县平均完成百分之三十五，沭阳县已完成百分之四十三点五，有些修堤小组在十数天内便完成了七十多天的任务。
