　　Two Points of Supplementation
　　Editor:
    Regarding the matter of "Wang Hengxiang Actively Leads the Masses to Plant Cotton" that I wrote (published in the People's Garden on April 28th), there is some new information today. Comrade Wang Hengxiang and all the cadres and party members have led the masses of the entire village to complete the planting of 2,535 mu of cotton (original task was 2,000 mu).

    In addition, regarding the matter of "Feng Chengui Should Be Punished" that I wrote (published in the same day's People's Garden), what should be supplemented is that the leading organization has already given Feng Chengui the punishment of dismissal.

　　两点补充编辑同志：
    关于我所写的“王恒祥积极领导群众种棉花”的事（刊四月二十八日人民园地），今天又有了一点新消息。王恒祥同志及全体干部、党员，已领导全村群众，完成种棉二千五百三十五亩（原任务二千亩）。
    另外，关于我所写的“冯辰桂应受处分”一事（刊同日人民园地），应当补充的是领导机关已给冯辰桂以撤职处分。
