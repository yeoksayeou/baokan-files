Xinhua News Agency, April 28th:

　　A total of thirty-nine officers, soldiers, and sailors from a certain unit of our People's Liberation Army, led by political instructor Dong Lifa, platoon leader Xu Junguang, and deputy platoon leader Wang Wengui, were sailing a junk from Beihai in Guangdong Province to Dongxing on the border on February 26th for training navigation and purchasing supplies. Unexpectedly, they encountered a gale, lost their direction, and went missing. It was not until March 4th that we learned they had been blown by the wind to Qingmei, opposite Yueshan in Vietnam, and were being detained by French troops, and had been disarmed. It is common for ships of one country to drift into the territory of another country due to wind, but our ships and personnel have been detained by the French army for a month without being released. Our side is now continuing to try to negotiate with the French side locally to return all personnel, weapons, and ships.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: It has been found that in recent months, incidents of French troops arbitrarily invading our territory have frequently occurred on the Sino-Vietnamese border. On March 15th, five French soldiers again invaded our territory and were discovered and detained by our border troops. The five French soldiers are currently under the custody of our army.
