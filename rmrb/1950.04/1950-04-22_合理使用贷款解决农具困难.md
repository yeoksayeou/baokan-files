　　[This newspaper reports] To solve the problem of farm implement shortages for newly land-owning poor and lower-middle peasants, the government granted Wulituo Village, District 19 of Beijing, an agricultural implement loan of 1,000 *jin* of millet. The village cooperative organized the households needing implement loans and signed a contract with the village blacksmith, stipulating: (1) Prices: large hoes at 35 *jin* each, small hoes at 7 *jin*, picks at 8 *jin*, sickles at 5 *jin*, manure rakes or iron spades at 8 *jin* each (all calculated in terms of millet). (2) Weight: large hoes at 5.5 *jin* each. (3) Delivery: large hoes to be made first, other implements not to interfere with the wheat harvest. (4) Payment: half to be paid in advance, the other half upon delivery. (5) Repairs: free repairs for any damage this year. After the contract was signed, a total of 41 implements, large and small, were made, saving 400 *jin* of millet on large hoes alone. The masses said, "This is a really good way, saving both trouble and money." Upon hearing the news, neighboring villages Sanjiadian and Long'ensi are also preparing to sign contracts with blacksmiths through their village cooperatives.

    【本报讯】为了解决新得地的贫雇农农具缺乏的困难，京十九区五里坨村由政府贷给农具贷款伏地米一千斤。村合作社将需要贷农具的户，组织起来和该村铁匠订立了合同，规定：（一）价格：大锄每把三十五斤，小锄七斤，镐八斤，镰刀五斤，粪耙或铁铣各八斤（均以口小米计算）。（二）分量：大锄每把重五斤半。（三）交货：先打大锄，其他农具不误麦收。（四）交款：先交一半，交货再给一半。（五）修理：今年坏了管修。合同订立之后，共打农具大小四十一件，仅大锄一项就可省小米四百斤。群众说：“这办法真好，又省事，又省钱。”邻村三家店和隆恩寺闻讯也准备由村合作社和铁匠订立合同。
