Introducing the Lightweight Iron Plow
    Wang Lianchen and Gong Lianyin Invent a Plow that Turns Soil Evenly and Saves Half the Labor
Editor:
    According to a report in the *Pingyuan Daily*, workers Wang Lianchen and Gong Lianyin of the Yumin Iron Factory in Liaocheng, Pingyuan Province, after returning from a visit to the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, actively researched and manufactured tools suitable for the local rural areas. They improved upon the single-handle plow they saw in Tianjin and successfully tested a lightweight iron plow. The main improvements to the plow's construction are as follows: (1) The front and rear plow supports have been replaced with two rollers, making it much lighter than having wooden supports touching the ground. (2) The plowshare and moldboard are made longer, which reduces the soil resistance. Additionally, the plowshare is flat, ensuring that all the soil is turned over, preventing the formation of clods. (3) A blade is installed in front of the plowshare to cut the soil to the desired width before the plowshare engages, preventing the plowshare from lifting wide swaths of soil. This makes plowing easier and lighter. The method of use is the same as the old plow, but the front roller can be raised or lowered freely to adjust the plowing depth as needed. The advantages of this plow are that it is not only lightweight and fast but also plows the soil evenly. Compared to the old-style plow, it can save half the labor. The results of the trial use show that it can be pulled by three people, plowing five mu of land in a day, and the plowing depth is the same as that of an old-style plow pulled by two medium-sized animals. The masses have reported that this improvement has solved a major problem for those with fewer or smaller livestock for plowing.
    We believe that this new agricultural tool should be widely promoted, so we are writing to you about this matter and the construction of the lightweight iron plow. We hope you will publish it to let everyone know.

### 介绍轻便铁犁  王连臣宫连印发明翻土均匀省力一半

　　介绍轻便铁犁
    王连臣宫连印发明翻土均匀省力一半编辑同志：
    据《平原日报》载称：平原省聊城裕民铁工厂工人王连臣、宫连印自参观天津工业展览会回厂后，即积极研究制造适用本地农村的工具，把在天津看到的单把犁，加以改良，试验一种轻便铁犁，已获成功。该犁经改造后其构造主要为（一）将前边和后边的犁托，改用两个滚轮，便比木托着地轻得多。（二）将犁铧和犁镜子作成长形，使土阻力较小，且犁铧为平面形，可使土全部翻过来，不致存留土块。（三）是在犁铧前边的犁按上装置一个刀子，把犁铧要犁多宽的土先离开来，使犁铧不致掀动横宽的土块，这样既翻土容易，又轻。使用方法上和旧犁子相同，但另可依需犁的深浅自由将犁前边的前滚轮弄高或弄低。该犁优点不但轻快，而且翻土均匀。与旧式犁子比较可省一半气力。现经试用结果，三人即可拉动，一天能犁五亩地，并和旧式犁用中等牲口两个所犁的深度相同。群众反映这个改进是给牲口少或小的耕地上解决了很大困难。
    我们觉得，这种新的农具，是应当普遍推广的，所以把这件事情和轻便铁犁的构造，写给告诉你们。希望你们刊登，让大家知道。
