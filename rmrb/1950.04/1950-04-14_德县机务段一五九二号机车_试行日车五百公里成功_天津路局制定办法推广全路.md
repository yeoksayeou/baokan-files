　　Dezhou Locomotive Depot Locomotive No. 1592
    Successfully Trials 500 Kilometers per Day
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Formulates Measures to Promote Across the Entire Railway System
    [Our Dispatch] The Dezhou Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau has successfully completed the demonstration operation of Locomotive No. 1592 (ㄇㄎ１) running 500 kilometers per day. The Railway Bureau has specially formulated temporary measures for the 500-kilometer Red Banner Locomotive Movement to promote it throughout the entire railway system. Under the personal guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Briebegen, the Tianjin Railway Bureau began round-trip experiments using Locomotive No. 1592 (ㄇㄎ１) of the Dezhou Locomotive Depot between Tianjin East Station and Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway from April 1st. Driver Liang Zongren and all the crew members worked together under the guidance of experts with full confidence. In addition, with the close cooperation of all relevant parties, the results of all three trials exceeded the goal of 500 kilometers per day, averaging 575.9 kilometers. The technical speed reached a maximum of 39.1 kilometers per hour, and the travel speed reached a maximum of 31.4 kilometers per hour. The locomotive turnaround time was shortened to 54 minutes, and the stay in the depot was shortened to 28 minutes. There were still some shortcomings in the experiment, such as too many stops outside the station, which affected the technical speed; the driver's operation of the brakes and steam valve switches was too rapid, and attention was not paid to the impact on the train; the stoker's firing training for the "One-Two-Three Movement" was insufficient. According to the calculation of this achievement, the Jinpu Railway alone can save three locomotives, 4,500 kilograms of coal, and 27 crew members per day. In order to promote this movement, in addition to awarding the locomotive a "500-kilometer" Red Banner and 100 points of wages, the Railway Bureau has specially formulated temporary measures for the 500-kilometer Red Banner Locomotive Movement, calling on each locomotive depot to first train at least one locomotive per depot to run 500 kilometers per day, and then gradually promote it, in order to achieve the goal of reducing locomotives, saving coal, reducing expenses, increasing daily kilometers, and reducing transportation costs.

　　德县机务段一五九二号机车
    试行日车五百公里成功 
    天津路局制定办法推广全路
    【本报讯】天津路局德县机务段ㄇㄎ１一五九二号机车日车五百公里运转示范作业胜利成功，路局特制定五百公里红旗机车运动暂行办法，以推广到全路。天津路局在苏联专家布里别根同志亲自指导下，从四月一日起，使用德县机务段ㄇㄎ１一五九二号机车在津浦线天津东站与德县间开始往返试验。司机长梁宗仁及全体包乘人员在专家指导下共同努力，信心充足，加之各有关方面密切配合，结果三次成绩均超过日车五百公里的奋斗目标，平均达到五七五点九公里。技术速度，最高三九·一公里，旅行速度最高三一·四公里。机车折返时间缩短到五十四分，库内停留时间缩短到二十八分。在试验当中仍有一些缺点，如机外停车太多，影响了技术速度；司机操纵制动机及汽门开关，动作太急，对列车冲动没有提起注意：司炉烧火对一二三运动训练尚不够。根据此次成绩计算，只津浦线每日即可节省机车三台，机煤四千五百公斤，乘务员二十七个。路局为推广这一运动，除奖给该机车“五百公里”红旗一面、工薪一百分外，特制定五百公里红旗机车运动暂行办法，号召各机务段每段至少先培养日车五百公里机一台，再逐渐推广，以达到减省机车，节约机煤，减少开支，提高日车公里减低运输成本的目的。
