How to View the Three Sino-Soviet Agreements?
    ——A Self-Criticism by Wu Yangpu, a Student at Peking University
    After the three Sino-Soviet economic cooperation agreements were published in the newspaper, I initially had some misconceptions about them. Because I saw that the three companies were "formed on the principle of equal rights and joint stock," that "the products of the two companies (petroleum and non-ferrous metals companies) shall be equally divided between China and the Soviet Union," and that "the expenses of the company and the profits derived therefrom shall also be equally divided between the two parties," I thought these provisions were beneficial to the Soviet Union and detrimental to China's interests. I even felt that they were "no different from the treaties signed by the Kuomintang with Britain and the United States." But after reading the People's Daily editorial on the 5th, "Welcome the Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation That is Beneficial to China's Economic Construction," I realized that I was not a practical patriot!
    My initial misconception was caused by the phrases "equal rights and joint stock" and "equal division of profits." The reasons for this misperception were twofold: (1) I did not understand the essential difference between the help given to China by socialist countries and the "help" (aggression) given to China by imperialist countries; (2) There was a latent exploitative consciousness: We need something, and the Soviet Union should give it to us for free. This is completely a lazy and selfish idea.
    With this confused idea, it is easy to be poisoned by imperialist propaganda. Imperialists, as the People's Daily editorial said: "If the Soviet Union does something that is obviously beneficial to others - 'Why are you so good? You have a conspiracy.' If the Soviet Union does something that is beneficial to both the Soviet Union and others - 'Why do you also take care of yourself? You are selfish.'" Now that the Soviet Union has done something that is beneficial to itself and even more beneficial to others, if we do not look at it from the standpoint of internationalism, and do not stand on the standpoint of true patriotism, then it is easy to be captured by the deceptive propaganda of imperialism.
    I initially did not understand that the material resources (people and machines) that the Soviet Union used to help us develop our economy are the fruits of the labor of the Soviet people, not something that fell from the sky; therefore, it should get its "worth." This is true brotherly relationship.
    With this understanding, I re-read the telegrams reporting the three Sino-Soviet economic cooperation agreements and the People's Daily editorial on the 5th. After self-reflection, I came to the following understanding:
    The three major Sino-Soviet economic cooperation agreements were first of all concluded to help China develop its economy on the principle of not harming the sovereignty of either side. From the Soviet side, it is an agreement that is both for friends and can take care of its own legitimate interests; from the Chinese side, it is an agreement that is both for its own great interests and can take care of the legitimate interests of friendly countries. China and the Soviet Union have common enemies and friends, and a common ultimate goal. From these three economic cooperation agreements and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance not long ago, we can clearly see a great spirit of internationalist friendship and mutual assistance.
    The People's Daily editorial said it well: "Every practical patriot knows that these agreements have made a good start for our country to use foreign capital and technology to develop economic construction on the principle of complete equality and mutual benefit." This is of course a serious blow to the imperialists, and it is a practical educational material for some people (like myself) who do not yet have enough understanding of true patriotism.

　　怎样看中苏三个协定？
    ——北大学生吴杨圃自我检讨
    报上前后发表了中苏三个经济合作协定，我最初对这些协定有些错觉，因为我看见三个公司“均按平权合股原则组成”、“两公司（石油、有色金属两公司）之产品由中苏双方平分之”、“公司之开支及其所得之利润亦由双方平分之”等规定，认为这是有利苏联而有损中国利益的规定，甚至觉得“和国民党与英美所订的条约没有什么分别”。可是等到我读了五日人民日报社论《欢迎有利于中国经济建设的中苏经济合作》以后，我知道自己并不是一个实际的爱国者！
    我最初的错觉，是由于“平权合股”、“利润平分”这些字样所引起的。所以造成我这个错误认识的原因有二：（一）不了解社会主义国家对中国的帮助，和帝国主义国家对中国的“帮助”（侵略）有本质的不同；（二）存在着一种潜伏的剥削意识：我们需要什么，苏联都该白送给我们，这完全是损人利己的懒汉思想。
    有了这种糊涂观念，就很容易中帝国主义者宣传的毒。帝国主义者，正如人民日报社论所说：“如果苏联做了一件显然有利于旁人的事，——‘你为什么这样好呢？你有阴谋。’如果苏联做了一件既有利于苏联又有利于旁人的事，——‘你为什么也顾到自己呢？你自私自利。’”现在苏联做了既有利于自身，更有利于旁人的事，我们如果不站在国际主义的立场上，不站在真正爱国主义的立场上来看它，那就很容易被帝国主义的欺骗宣传所俘掳。
    我最初不了解：苏联帮助我们开发经济的物质资料（人和机器），是苏联人民劳动的成果，并不是天上掉下来的；因此，它是应该得到一份“所值”的。这才是真正的兄弟关系。
    在这样一个认识下，我又重新读了报导中苏三个经济合作协定的电讯，和五日人民日报社论。经过自我反省，我才得到如下的了解：
    中苏三大经济合作协定，是首先为了在不损害双方主权的原则下，帮助中国发展经济而订定的。站在苏联方面说，是既为了朋友，而又能顾全自己正当利益的一种协定；站在中国方面说，是既为了自己巨大利益，而又能照顾友邦的正当利益的一种协定。中苏两国有共同的敌友，和共同的最后目标，我们从这三个经济合作协定和不久前的中苏友好同盟互助条约，可以明确看出一种伟大的国际主义友爱互助精神。
    人民日报社论说得好：“每一个实际的爱国者都知道，这些协定对于我国在完全平等互利的原则下利用外国资本和技术发展经济建设这一件大事，是作了一个良好的开端。”这对于帝国主义者当然是一种严重的打击，而对于一些对真正爱国主义还不够了解的人们（如我自己），则是一种实际的教育材料。
