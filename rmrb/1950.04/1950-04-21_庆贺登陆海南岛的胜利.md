　　Celebrating the Victory of Landing on Hainan Island

　　The powerful corps of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, after a night of crossing the sea on the 16th, has successfully landed on Qiongyai (Hainan Island); most of the Chiang bandits' fortifications along the northern coast of Qiongyai have been destroyed; the entire defense system of the enemy in Qiongyai has been completely disrupted. Now, the liberation army has successfully joined forces with the local people's armed forces in Qiongyai and is advancing in several directions, taking advantage of the victory. The complete liberation of Hainan Island will come soon. This is another great joy for the people of the whole country. We extend our respects to the brave commanders and fighters of the Fourth Field Army who victoriously crossed the sea! We extend our respects to the Qiongyai People's Liberation Army and the people of Qiongyai who have fought bravely for more than twenty years!

　　The successful landing of the People's Liberation Army on Qiongyai is a heavy blow to American imperialism and the remaining Chiang bandits. After the liberation army liberated all the mainland except Tibet, the Chiang bandits gathered their remnants and fled to several islands. The only fantasy of the bandit leaders and their main deception of the remaining bandit troops was the myth that the liberation army "cannot fight at sea, cannot cross the sea." This myth also comforted the American imperialists and the reactionaries of other countries. In recent months, with the assistance of American imperialism, the Chiang bandits have blockaded the mouth of the Yangtze River, the mouth of the Minjiang River, and coastal cities with the navy, frantically bombed major coastal cities with the air force, and directed special agents and bandits to carry out harassment and sabotage on the mainland, in an attempt to disrupt our plan for crossing the sea; at the same time, they strengthened fortifications on Taiwan, Qiongyai, Zhoushan, and Kinmen Islands, dreaming of escaping final destruction. However, due to the successful landing of the People's Liberation Army in front of the enemy on Qiongyai, this fantasy of the enemy has now been fundamentally shattered!

　　Qiongyai is the second largest island in our country after Taiwan, and it is a military strategic location in South China, once known as the "gateway to South China." It faces the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong Province across the sea; the island covers an area of more than 40,000 square kilometers, with a population of about 2.5 million, abundant agricultural products, three harvests a year, and rich mineral resources. For the past twenty years, the people of Qiongyai, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have been waging arduous and heroic struggles against the oppression, exploitation, and massacre of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, Japanese imperialism, and American imperialism. The Qiongyai Red Army, organized during the land revolution, developed into the anti-Japanese Qiongyai Independent Column during the Anti-Japanese War, and became even stronger in the Liberation War, developing into the Qiongyai Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, liberating vast areas of Qiongyai, and establishing the Qiongyai People's Government. After the basic liberation of the mainland, bandit troops such as Bai Chongxi, Xue Yue, and Yu Hanmou fled to Qiongyai one after another. In order to cooperate with the sea-crossing operations of the brother troops on the mainland, our Qiongyai Liberation Army launched several powerful offensives in the heartland of the Qiongyai bandit troops, which played a significant role in coordinating the sea-crossing operations of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army against Qiongyai. The unyielding struggle of the military and civilians of Qiongyai for more than 20 years will soon achieve complete victory.

　　The successful landing of the People's Liberation Army on Qiongyai is of utmost importance for future sea-crossing operations against Kinmen, Zhoushan, and Taiwan. Facts have proven that the powerful People's Liberation Army can not only cross the natural barriers of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River to liberate the entire Chinese mainland, but also has full confidence in crossing the wide ocean to liberate any islands at sea. The People's Liberation Army, which has annihilated 7.5 million Chiang bandit reactionary troops, has now hoisted the banner of victory on Qiongyai. Therefore, everyone can be confident that the complete and thorough annihilation of the more than 500,000 remaining bandits entrenched on Taiwan and other islands is not far away.

　　However, it must be pointed out that the victory of the Qiongyai landing operation is only the beginning of the entire sea-crossing operation, and the liberation of Taiwan still requires more serious battles. We cannot ignore the difficulties of larger-scale sea-crossing operations in the future because of the victory in Qiongyai. The People's Liberation Army, which is tasked with liberating Kinmen, Zhoushan, and Taiwan, must not slacken our preparations for sea-crossing operations. We must complete the task of liberating Taiwan, which is to complete the final battle of liberating all of China, as accurately as the Fourth Field Army attacking Qiongyai. People from all walks of life across the country should continue to vigorously support the People's Liberation Army and thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the enemy. After the liberation of Taiwan, the enemy will no longer be able to gain a foothold on Chinese territory, and will no longer be able to impose blockades and bombings. Our country will completely shift from war to peaceful construction, and our country's economic and financial situation will greatly improve accordingly. For this final battle, let the military and civilians of the whole country work together!

### 庆贺登陆海南岛的胜利

　　庆贺登陆海南岛的胜利
    人民解放军第四野战军的强大兵团，经过十六日一夜的渡海作战，已经在琼崖（海南岛）胜利登陆了；蒋匪在琼崖北岸沿海的防御工事，大部分已经被摧毁了；琼崖敌人全部防御体系，被完全打乱了。现在，解放大军已和琼崖本地的人民武装胜利会合，正分成几路，乘胜前进。海南岛的彻底解放，很快就要到来了。这是全国人民又一次的大喜事，我们谨向胜利渡海作战的第四野战军的英勇指战员致敬！谨向二十几年来英勇奋斗的琼崖人民解放军和琼崖人民致敬！
    解放军在琼崖胜利登陆，对美帝国主义和残余的蒋匪是一个沉重的打击。在解放大军解放除西藏以外的全部大陆以后，蒋匪收拾起残兵败将，逃到几个海岛上。匪首们唯一的幻想和他们对于残余匪军的主要的欺骗，就是所谓解放军“不能海上作战、不能渡海作战”的神话。这个神话也安慰着美帝国主义者和其他国家的反动派。近几个月来，蒋匪在美帝国主义援助下，一面用海军封锁我长江口、闽江口和沿海城市，用空军疯狂轰炸我沿海各大都市，指挥特务土匪在大陆上进行骚扰破坏，想破坏我渡海作战的计划；一面在台湾、琼崖、舟山、金门各岛加强防御工事，梦想能逃避最后的灭亡。但是，由于人民解放军在琼崖敌前登陆成功，敌人这个幻想现在是被根本打破了！
    琼崖是我国仅次于台湾的第二个大岛，是华南的军事战略要地，曾被称为“南中国的门户”。它和广东省的雷州半岛隔海相望；全岛面积四万余方公里，人口约二百五十万，农产富足，一年三收，矿产也很丰富。二十年来，琼崖人民为了反对国民党匪帮、日本帝国主义和美帝国主义的压迫、剥削和屠杀，在中国共产党领导下，一直作着艰苦的英勇斗争。土地革命时代组织起来的琼崖红军，在抗日战争中发展成为抗日的琼崖独立纵队，在解放战争中更为壮大，发展成为中国人民解放军琼崖纵队，解放了琼崖广大地区，成立了琼崖人民政府。大陆基本解放以后，白崇禧、薛岳、余汉谋等匪军先后逃到琼崖，我琼崖解放军，为了配合大陆上兄弟部队的渡海作战，在琼崖匪军的心腹地区发动了几次强大的攻势，这对于配合人民解放军第四野战军对琼崖的渡海作战，起了重大的作用。琼崖军民廿几年不屈不挠的斗争，不久就可以得到完全的胜利了。
    人民解放军在琼崖的胜利登陆，对于今后对金门、舟山和台湾的渡海作战有极重要的帮助。事实已经证明，强大的人民解放军不但能渡过黄河和长江的天险，解放全部中国大陆，并且也有完全的把握，渡过宽阔的海洋，解放任何海上的岛屿。已经消灭了七百五十万蒋匪反动武装的人民解放军，现在又把胜利的大旗插上了琼崖，因此，大家可以确信，窃据台湾等海岛上的五十几万残余匪帮之被全部干净彻底消灭，已经为期不远了。
    但是，必须指出：琼崖登陆作战的胜利，还只是整个渡海作战的开始，解放台湾还须经过更严重的战斗。我们不能因为琼崖的胜利而忽视了今后更大规模渡海作战的困难，担任解放金门、舟山和台湾任务的人民解放军，丝毫也不能松懈我们的渡海作战准备，我们必须要和进攻琼崖的第四野战军一样准确完成解放台湾，也就是完成解放全中国最后一战的任务。全国各界人民应继续大力支援解放军，彻底肃清残敌。在台湾解放以后，敌人再不能在中国领土上立足，再不能施行封锁和轰炸了，我们的国家将全部由战争转入和平建设的轨道，我们国家的经济财政状况也就将随之而大大好转了。为着这最后一战，全国的军民一致努力啊！
