We also recognize that the Kuomintang bandit gang's so-called propaganda of destroying religion, killing monks, and burning temples was purely shameless rumors. Monks and laypeople alike pledge to unite as one and strive to realize the Common Program under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party."
