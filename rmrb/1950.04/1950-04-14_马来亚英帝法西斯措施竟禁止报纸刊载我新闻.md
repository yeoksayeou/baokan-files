　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: According to a report from the Electric News Agency in London on the 11th: The British colonial authorities in Malaya have recently issued an order prohibiting newspapers from publishing news broadcast by Beijing. The authorities have implemented this ban in Singapore and announced that if the ban is violated, the newspaper's distribution license will be revoked. This ban clearly shows how concerned and sympathetic the people of Malaya are to the Asian liberation movement and the progress of the Chinese revolution; and will mean that in the future, newspapers can only publish news released by the authorities. The imperialists have adopted this new measure similar to fascist legislation without giving any reason.
    At the same time, the film censorship implemented by the British colonial authorities in Malaya has blocked the situation of progressive movements around the world. The Malayan Film Bureau is about to ban two newsreels depicting the Chinese People's Liberation Army arriving at the border between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The ban also includes prohibiting the screening of the Soviet documentary "May Day Parade" in Malaya.

　　马来亚英帝法西斯措施竟禁止报纸刊载我新闻
    【新华社十二日讯】据电通社伦敦十一日讯：马来亚英国殖民地当局最近又颁布命令，不准报纸刊载北京广播的新闻。当局已将这个禁令在新加坡实施，并且宣布如若违反禁令，即取消该报的发行许可证。这个禁令清楚地表明马来亚人民对亚洲的解放运动及中国革命的进展表示如何的关注与同情；并将意味着报纸今后可以刊载的消息，只有官方所发表的新闻。帝国主义者采取这一类似法西斯立法的新措施，并未举出任何理由。
    同时，马来亚英国殖民当局所实施的电影检查，已使全世界各地进步运动的情况为之堵塞。马来亚电影局即将取缔两部描绘中国人民解放军到达广州和香港交界地点的新闻片。禁令也包括禁止苏联记录片《五一大检阅》在马来亚放映。
