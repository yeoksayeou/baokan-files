People's Postal Worker Sun Wang Delivers Letters Through Wind and Rain

Comrade Sun Wang is a hero of the wartime post office before the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing. He joined the army after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, fought bravely, and was gloriously wounded twice, making it impossible for him to continue working in the army. In July 1947, he joined the Xincheng Post Office. After arriving at the post office, he was proactive in his work, able to complete tasks in difficult environments, and was very good at uniting with comrades. Therefore, he was supported and loved by all comrades in the bureau, and was twice elected as a hero by the 10th Postal Office and received a certificate of merit from the Jizhong Bureau.

On the morning of April 15th this year, the wind was very strong, but Comrade Lao Sun put his newspapers and letters in order with a smile, rolled up his trousers, tied the document bag around his waist, put on a raincoat and went to work. He said to his comrades: "Wind and rain can't stop us from delivering newspapers and letters. During the war, we had to complete our tasks in the hail of bullets. We defeated the stubborn enemy, so can't we defeat the wind and rain?"

Under his influence, all the comrades set out to work. But most of the comrades came back without completely completing their tasks. Comrade Lao Sun delivered mail to eighteen villages along the route, completing a task of more than fifty li. In Chenzhuang, an old woman said with emotion: "The People's Post Office is so good, sending us letters even in the rain." When Comrade Lao Sun returned to the bureau, his clothes were soaked, and his lips were frozen blue. The comrades all said, "Comrade Lao Sun must be cold." Comrade Lao Sun replied, "As long as I can complete the task, I am happier than anything else." He also said: "The rainy season will be here soon, and I want to guarantee that not a single newspaper or letter from Beijing and Baoding will be delayed."

　　人民邮务员孙旺  风雨无阻投送信件
    孙旺同志是平津未解放前战时邮局功臣。他在抗日战争爆发后参加军队，作战勇敢，光荣负伤两次，不能在部队继续工作。一九四七年七月，他参加了新城邮局工作。到邮局后，对工作积极，能在艰苦的环境中完成任务，对同志们团结也很好，因此，得到全局同志们拥护和爱戴，在邮政第十办事处两次被选为功臣，并得到冀中局的奖状。
    今年四月十五日早上，风很大，老孙同志却面带笑容的把自己的报纸和信件整理好，挽起裤子，赤着脚把文件包捆在腰内，披上雨布出去工作。他对同志说：“风雨挡不住咱们送报与送信。在战争时，我们在枪林弹雨中还要完成任务。咱们把顽强的敌人都战胜了，就不能战胜风雨吗？”
    同志们在他的影响下，大家都出发工作了。但多数同志没有彻底完成任务就回来了。老孙同志沿着线投了十八个村，完成了五十余里的任务。在陈庄，一位老大娘感动的说：“人民邮局真好，下着雨还给我们送信。”老孙同志回局时，衣服都淋湿了，嘴唇也冻得发青了。同志们都说：“老孙同志冷吧。”老孙同志回答说：“只要能完成任务，我比什么也痛快。”他还说：“雨季不久即要来到，北京、保定来的报纸信件，我要保证不压一份。”
