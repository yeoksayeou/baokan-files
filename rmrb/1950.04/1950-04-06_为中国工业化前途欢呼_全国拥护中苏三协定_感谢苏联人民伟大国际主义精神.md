　　Xinhua News Agency, April 5th - Northeast China: People from all walks of life in Northeast China are unanimously elated by the signing of the agreements between China and the Soviet Union to jointly establish three companies. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, said: These three agreements will powerfully promote the development of new China's industrial construction. With the development of industrial construction, they will bring an ever-increasing happy life to the working class. Northeast workers will strive to improve their skills and establish a high sense of responsibility to ensure the timely completion of the national industrial production plan, to show their support for these three agreements. The Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Northeast Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Northeast Student Federation, and the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation have all expressed their opinions, expressing infinite joy and support. Xu Yingnian, Director of the Industrial Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, said: Our China is an industrially backward country. In the past, due to imperialist aggression and oppression, heavy industry and aviation were unable to develop, and rich oil and non-ferrous metal mineral resources were buried underground and could not be exploited. The establishment of Sino-Soviet oil and non-ferrous metal joint-stock companies will solve the extremely important source of raw materials for the construction of new China's heavy industry, enabling China's industrial construction to move forward at an accelerated pace. This makes us industrial and mining personnel even more confident in building a new industrialized China. Wang Qingzheng, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, said: The new Sino-Soviet agreement proves that only the socialist Soviet Union can help the Chinese people build and develop China's industry. People from all walks of life in our province express their deep gratitude for the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people. Deng Jianqiao, Vice President of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: The entire policy of the American government is to turn China into its colony, but the great Soviet Union is helping us accelerate our progress towards industrialization and eliminate the backward state of the Chinese economy caused by imperialism and domestic reactionaries more quickly. We Chinese people warmly welcome this forward development of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and our country. People from all walks of life in Liaoxi Province have also expressed their opinions and unanimously expressed their support for this agreement.
    East China
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 5th - People in various parts of East China warmly support the agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union to establish two joint-stock companies for oil and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang, and the agreement to establish a Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint-Stock Company. The Nanjing Federation of Trade Unions, with 70,000 members, issued a written statement saying: The signing of the three agreements signifies a further development of the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. The agreement stipulates joint exploration and exploitation of oil and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang, and rotation of company leaders, fully embodying the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. Sa Zhenbing, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office of the Fuzhou Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: With the correct leadership of the People's Government and the assistance of Soviet friendship, the underground treasures of China's largest province - Xinjiang - can now be exploited to supply the needs of the motherland's industrial construction. Wu Liangjie, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: These three agreements have encouraged the working class in Fujian to intensify the struggle against blockade and bombing, support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea to fight, eliminate the remaining enemies, and jointly carry out industrial construction. Gu Dehuan, Director of the Industry and Mining Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, said: This agreement on equal rights and joint ventures to develop China's basic industries is completely in line with the interests of the people of both China and the Soviet Union, and is especially beneficial to China's industrialization. Without Soviet assistance and cooperation in terms of funds and technology, it would be completely impossible for us to undertake such large-scale oil and non-ferrous metal exploitation work in the difficult period when the mainland of China has just been liberated and the war has not yet completely ended. Shi Jingtang, Vice President of the Xuzhou Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: The establishment of the three companies will help the construction of the New Democratic economy and shorten the process of China's industrialization. Xia Zhengnong, President of the Jinan Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: These three agreements are another major blow to American imperialism, telling them: The friendship between the two great brotherly countries of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable! The Qingdao Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee issued a written statement saying: The signing of the new agreements marks the increasingly close unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union. The person in charge of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee believes that these agreements are another strong guarantee for the rapid development of China's industry.
    Central and South China
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 5th - People from all walks of life in the Central and South China region unanimously and warmly support the three agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union on jointly establishing oil, non-ferrous metals, and civil aviation companies. Wu Zili, Deputy Minister of the Communications Department of the Central and South China Military and Political Committee, praised the Sino-Soviet joint venture civil aviation company as a new era for China's aviation industry. Zhou Qide, manager of the Central China Petroleum Company, pointed out: In the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, China's oil market was completely monopolized and controlled by the United States and Britain, who used it to extract a large amount of money from China. In the future, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, China's oil industry will be able to obtain conditions for full development. Industrialist Mao Bosheng believes that the exploitation of oil and non-ferrous metals will accelerate the realization of industrialization throughout China. The Hubei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a written statement, supporting these agreements, and issued a notice to all branches, calling for the immediate launch of widespread and in-depth publicity to smash the shameless rumors of imperialism and reactionaries, and to dispel the doubts of some people. People from all walks of life in Kaifeng, Henan, and Nanchang, Jiangxi, compared the socialist countries' assistance to China with the imperialist countries' destruction and oppression of China, and pointed out the great significance of these agreements. Fu Fochen, a member of the industrial and commercial circles in Kaifeng City, said: With the enthusiastic assistance of the great Soviet Union, China will completely get rid of all imperialist exploitation. Looking back on all the mining industries jointly run with imperialist countries in Chinese history, none have not suffered from imperialist seizure. For example, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan was manipulated by the British to absorb most of the profits, and its mining technology was not allowed to be known to the Chinese. But the current Sino-Soviet agreement is completely equal and mutually beneficial. Li Zhangda, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee in Guangzhou, said: The Soviet Union is helping China, with its advanced technology, to develop urgently needed resources and develop China's young civil aviation industry. We express our warm welcome. Situ Meitang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: We overseas Chinese warmly support the Sino-Soviet agreements on jointly establishing oil, non-ferrous metals, and civil aviation companies. This will shorten our process of transforming from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The articles of association, personnel, capital, and profits of the three companies are all based on the spirit of equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union.
    Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 5th - People from all walks of life in Tianjin support the Sino-Soviet agreements on oil, non-ferrous metals joint-stock companies, and civil aviation joint-stock companies. Huang Huoqing, Director of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, said: This agreement is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit between China and the Soviet Union. It will strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. At the same time, the establishment of the two companies will also train a lot of technical personnel for China. Luo Yun, Director of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, Zhang Huaisan, Director of the Municipal Youth League Working Committee, and He Qijun, President of the Democratic Youth Federation, unanimously expressed their support for the agreements between China and the Soviet Union. Zhou Shutao, General Manager of Qixin Cement Company, said: Oil and non-ferrous metals are the most needed things for our Chinese industry, but with our China's existing manpower, material resources, and experience, there is absolutely no way to exploit them alone. Now the Soviet Union is completely helping us in the spirit of equal rights and joint ventures, which is what we most welcome. Bi Mingqi, Manager of Huasheng Trading Company, said: The demand for oil in China is very large, and it has always been imported from Britain and the United States. The annual import volume of non-ferrous metals is also quite large. The two items consume a large amount of our country's foreign exchange. Now the Soviet Union is helping us to exploit the oil and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang, which is unanimously welcomed by the Chinese people. Li Zhuchen, General Manager of Jiuda Salt Industry Company, Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of Renli Industrial Company, and others have expressed their support for the agreements between China and the Soviet Union.

    感谢苏联人民伟大国际主义精神
    东北
    【新华社五日讯】东北各界人士一致为中苏签订合办三个公司的协定而欢欣鼓舞。东北总工会主席张维桢说：这三个协定将有力地促进新中国工业建设的发展，随着工业建设的发展，将给工人阶级带来日愈增大的幸福生活。东北工人们将努力提高技术，树立高度的责任观念，以保证国家工业生产计划按期完成，来表示对这三个协定的拥护。中苏友好协会东北总分会、新民主主义青年团东北工作委员会、东北学生联合会、东北民主妇女联合会都发表意见，表示无限的欢欣与拥护。黑龙江省人民政府工业厅厅长许英年说：我们中国是一个工业落后的国家，过去由于受帝国主义的侵略与压迫，重工业和航空事业得不到发展，丰富的石油和有色金属矿产都埋藏地下无力开采。这次中苏石油、有色金属股份公司的创立，将为新中国重工业建设解决极重要的原料来源问题，使中国工业建设得以兼程迈进。这使我们工矿人士愈加增强了建设工业化新中国的信心。黑龙江省人民代表会议协商委员会副主席王清正说：中苏新协定证明，只有社会主义国家的苏联才能帮助中国人民建设和发展中国的工业。我们全省各界人民，对于苏联人民的伟大国际主义精神表示深切的谢意。哈尔滨市中苏友好协会副会长邓建桥说：美国政府的全部政策是要使中国变成它的殖民地，而伟大的苏联却帮助我们加速度地向工业化迈进和更快地扫除帝国主义和国内反动派所造成的中国经济的落后状态。我们中国人民热诚欢迎苏联与我国的这种经济合作的向前发展。辽西省的各界人士也纷纷发表谈话一致表示对于这个协定的拥护。
    华东
    【新华社上海五日电】华东各地人民热烈拥护中苏两国签订在新疆创办石油和有色金属两股份公司的协定及创办中苏民用航空股份公司协定。包括七万会员的南京市总工会发表书面意见说：三个协定的签订，表示中苏两国的友谊关系是更进一步的发展了。协定规定共同勘测和开采新疆石油和有色金属，并轮流担任公司正副负责人，充分体现了平等互惠的精神。中苏友好协会福州分会筹备处副主任萨镇冰说：靠着人民政府的正确领导和苏联友谊的援助，使中国最大省份——新疆的地下富藏现在能够开采，以供给祖国工业建设的需用了。福建省总工会筹备会主任吴良杰说：这三个协定鼓舞了福建工人阶级，将更加紧地展开反封锁、反轰炸的斗争，支援人民解放军渡海作战，肃清残敌，共同进行工业建设。浙江省人民政府工矿厅厅长顾德欢说：这个平权合股发展中国基本工业的协定，是完全符合中苏两国人民利益的，尤其有利于中国工业化，如果没有苏联在资金上、技术上的帮助和合作，我们中国要想在全国大陆刚刚解放而战争尚未完全结束的困难时期来兴办这样大规模的石油和有色金属的开采工作是完全不可能的。中苏友好协会徐州分会副会长史敬棠说：三公司的创办，有助于新民主主义经济的建设，将缩短中国工业化的过程。中苏友好协会济南市分会会长夏征农说：这三个协定又给美帝国主义一个重大的打击，告诉他们：中苏两大兄弟国家的友谊是牢不可破的！青岛市民主妇联筹委会发表书面意见说：新协定的签订，标志着中苏两国人民日益紧密的团结。该市工商联合会筹委会负责人认为这些协定是中国工业迅速发展的又一有力保证。
    中南
