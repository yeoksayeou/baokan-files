　　Selecting Models by Summarizing Winter School Achievements
    Licheng Establishes Over Two Hundred People's Schools
    [This newspaper report] Correspondent Li Jiangyuan reports: Licheng County, Shandong Province, through summarizing winter school learning achievements and selecting winter school models, has established 210 people's schools that persist in year-round learning, with a total of 6,106 students. This includes 148 youth night schools, with 4,358 students; 39 women's literacy classes, with 1,163 students; 22 adult night schools, with 575 students; and 1 children's class, with 10 students.

    The county is mostly newly liberated area and has not yet carried out land reform. In addition, it is close to Jinan City, and many farmers engage in sideline occupations such as transportation and sales during the winter slack season, making it relatively difficult to establish winter schools. However, due to the county government, the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and the leading organs of various people's organizations attaching importance to mass literacy education (such as jointly running winter school teacher training classes and holding winter school teacher meetings, with the county head and the Communist Youth League secretary personally giving reports, etc.), the winter school movement last year achieved results, with 316 winter schools established, with a total of 9,821 students. Before the Spring Festival holiday, the county government made unified arrangements in a planned way: all winter schools were to conduct unified tests, announce results, and select models. Through this work, activists in winter schools were discovered and became the backbone of the transition to people's schools, and the learning enthusiasm of the masses was encouraged. It changed the suspicions and concerns of some of the masses who thought that "attending winter school is a waste of effort, one cannot read," or even feared "being drafted into the army," and laid a mass foundation for the transition from winter schools to people's schools. Some farmers who had not participated in winter schools before also joined the people's school learning this time.

    On March 4th (Lunar January 16th), the county government held a winter school teacher meeting to summarize the county's winter school work, and selected good winter schools and good teachers to make typical reports and exchange work experience. Good winter school teachers were also commended, and all the winter school teachers present were educated, consolidating and enhancing the teachers' morale. At this meeting and the subsequent second joint meeting of cultural and educational assistants from all districts in the county, the issues in the transition from winter schools to people's schools were also discussed, and several measures were studied: (1) People's schools must improve teaching effectiveness on the one hand, so that the masses truly feel the benefits of attending school; on the other hand, they must adhere to certain systems (such as roll call, testing, model evaluation, and summary), and formulate conventions through mass democratic discussion, in order to gradually move towards a new type of regular school. (2) Depending on the different seasons and the busy and slack periods of the farmers, the form of learning organization should be changed to adapt to the needs of production. If necessary, the whole should be broken down into parts, and small teachers should be used for decentralized teaching, but the learning group should be maintained as the basic unit of learning. The learning group should be combined with production organizations (such as labor exchange teams). (3) Learning time is not necessarily in the evening; it can also be at noon (generally, young people do not rest at noon), and the time can be shortened during busy farming seasons. (4) More new lessons should be taught during centralized classes, and review time should be spent on self-study and group activities. Rainy days and slack farming seasons should be used for inspections, tests, and summaries.

    Regarding the issue of the treatment of people's school teachers, the county government formulated specific measures based on the experience of some villages in the winter schools, which were widely supported by the masses after being communicated.

### 通过总结冬学成绩评选模范  历城建民校二百余所

　　通过总结冬学成绩评选模范
    历城建民校二百余所
    【本报讯】通讯员李江源报道：山东省历城县通过总结冬学学习成绩，评选冬学模范等工作，已建立坚持长年学习的民校二百一十处，共有学员六千一百零六人。其中包括青年夜校一百四十八处，学员四千三百五十八人；妇女识字班三十九处，学员一千一百六十三人；成人夜校二十二处，学员五百七十五人；儿童班一处，学员十人。
    该县大部分是新解放区，还未进行土地改革，加之邻近济南市，农民到冬季农闲时，多从事运销等副业，开办冬学的条件是比较困难的。但由于该县政府、共产党、青年团以及各民众团体领导机关重视群众补习教育（如协力开办冬学教师训练班、召开冬学教师会议，县长、青委书记亲自作报告等）。去年的冬学运动获得了成绩，开办了冬学三百一十六处，学员共九千八百二十一名。春节放假前，县府有计划地作了统一的布置：所有冬学一律进行测验，公布成绩，并评选模范。通过这工作，发现了冬学中的积极分子，成为转民校学习的骨干；并鼓励了群众的学习情绪。转变了一部分群众认为“上冬学白搭工，不识字”，甚至怕“拔兵”等怀疑和顾虑，打下了冬学转民校的群众基础。有些原来没有参加冬学的农民，这回也参加了民校学习。
    三月四日（旧历正月十六），县府又召开了冬学教师会议，总结了全县冬学工作，并选出好的冬学、好的教师作了典型报告，交流了工作经验，从中也表扬了好的冬学教师，教育了所有到会的冬学教师，巩固和提高了教师的情绪。在此次会议以及接着举行的第二次全县各区文教助理员联席会议上，又着重讨论了冬学转民校中的问题，研究了几项办法：（一）各民校一方面要提高教学效果，使群众真正感到上学的好处；另一方面还要坚持有一定的制度（如点名、测验、评模、总结等），通过群众民主讨论，订立公约，以期逐步走向新型的正规学校。（二）随着不同的季节、农民的忙闲情形，适应生产的需要而改变学习组织形式，必要时化整为零，利用小先生分散教学，但应保持以小组为学习的基本单位。学习小组与生产组织等（如变工组）结合一致。（三）学习时间不一定在晚上，中午（一般青年中午不歇晌）也可以，农忙时可以缩短些时间。（四）集中上课时多授新课，复习时间放在自我学习与小组活动中。并利用雨天农闲时间，进行检查、测验、总结等。
    关于民校教师的待遇问题，该县根据冬学中一些村庄的经验，由县府规定了具体办法，经传达后深得群众拥护。
