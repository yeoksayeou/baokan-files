　　The CCP Huixian Luokou Village Branch Solved Two Problems in Spring Plowing
　　Wang Changlong
　　Luokou Village in Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, is an old revolutionary base area with 147 households. The branch has 23 party members. Last winter, the branch's leadership in sideline production achieved considerable success.

　　This spring is short, and spring plowing must start early. The branch proposed: "The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring." A late start will greatly affect the year's increased production. Before the Lunar New Year, the branch studied what should be done first after the New Year and made a resolution. Through discussion and modification by the People's Representative Assembly, it became a plan and resolution approved by the entire village. During the New Year's group greeting, the People's Representative Assembly announced the village's production plan and resolution and made a production mobilization.

　　The plan and resolution of the People's Representative Assembly had two points: First, for spring plowing, the whole village must prepare enough fuel to prevent a shortage during spring plowing. Second, to ensure increased production in the wheat season, it is necessary to hoe the wheat and apply top dressing fertilizer, and start early.

　　The branch issued a call for party members to take the lead in ensuring the implementation of the People's Representative Assembly's resolution, and decided that Comrade Hao Taoshan would lead the villagers to Lingchuan to carry coal. However, it was impossible to return from Luokou to Lingchuan in one day, and staying overnight on the road incurred high accommodation and food expenses, so everyone was reluctant to go. In this situation, the branch actively sought solutions, helping and organizing the village's blacksmiths to set up iron stoves in Shuangnao Village, both repairing farm tools to earn money and solving the problem of accommodation for those from the village who went out to carry coal. This way, through transshipment, both ends could make a round trip in one day, and the shorter distance allowed them to carry more. After everyone calculated, they felt that this approach was very worthwhile, and they happily went to Lingchuan to carry coal. After the fifth day of the first lunar month, Hao Taoshan led 31 people on two trips, spending four days, and carried back 6,237 catties of coal, averaging over 200 catties per person, enough for cooking until the end of May. The women happily said, "Now that everyone is in the fields, we don't have to worry about cooking fuel."

　　If the men go to carry coal, who will hoe the wheat? The branch's conclusion was: "We must educate and organize young and middle-aged women to work in the fields." At the same time, this would lay the foundation for women to participate in major agricultural labor throughout the year. Therefore, it was decided that Comrade Bai Fengying (chairwoman of the Women's Association and labor hero) and Comrade Guo Baoming (chairman of the Farmers' Association) would lead and organize women to hoe wheat. Initially, 31 women were organized to hoe wheat in the fields, but they were all clumsy and didn't know how to hoe. Comrades Guo Baoming and Bai Fengying actively sought solutions and patiently taught everyone how to hoe. Guo Baoming came up with the idea of using livestock to pull a furrower in front to loosen the soil, making it easier for the women to hoe. Bai Fengying hoed in front, letting everyone watch from behind. While hoeing, she taught everyone: "The right hand has more strength in front, bend your back and arch your shoulders to hoe deep, keep your feet steady and don't step on the ground, keep some distance between each person and each row." She would also put down the hoe from time to time, holding the hands and legs of women who didn't know how to hoe, pointing out where to hold the hands and where to step with the feet. In this way, under the organization and leadership of Guo and Bai, 30 more women were gradually organized to hoe wheat. In six days, the whole village hoed 800 mu (with men participating, but mainly women), with only 150 mu unhoed. Because women were organized to participate in hoeing wheat, the entire village completed the hoeing ahead of schedule. People who previously looked down on women working in the fields also said, "When women are organized, things are really different!" And the women who learned how to hoe are also different from before! After returning from the fields, the topics they discussed were no longer about trivial family matters, but they stood together with the men, discussing how to hoe the fields better.

　　中共辉县罗口村支部解决了春耕中的两个问题
    王昌隆
    平原省辉县罗口村是老区，有一四七户人家。支部党员有二十三人。去年冬天，支部领导副业生产曾获得不少成绩。
    今年春短，春耕要早动手。支部提出：“一年之计在于春”。动手晚了，全年增产就要受大影响。支部在旧历年前，就研究了过了年首先应该干什么并做出决议，通过人代会的讨论修改，成为全村群众所赞成的计划和决议。过年团拜时，由人代会宣布了全村的生产计划和决议，并做了生产动员。
    人代会的计划和决议，有两个：一、为了春耕，全村必须准备足够的燃料，以防备正在春耕时没啥烧。二、为了保证麦季增产，必须锄麦上追粪。并需及早动手。
    支部发出了党员带头保证实现人代会决议的号召，并决定郝桃山同志，领导全村群众到陵川担炭。但是从罗口到陵川去担炭一天中回不来，路上要住店，食宿盘费大，大家都不肯去。支部在这样的情况下，就积极的想办法，帮助和组织本村的铁匠到双脑村去按铁炉，一面修理农具赚钱，一面给本村出外担炭的人解决店房住宿问题。这样隔栈转运，两头在一天内都可打个来回，且又路近担的多。大家盘算一下觉得这样做很合得来，都高兴地到陵川去担炭了。过了正月初五，郝桃山带领三十一人担了两回，费四天工夫，担回炭六、二三七斤，每人平均二百余斤，只做饭烧可烧至五月底。妇女们高兴的说：“大家上了地，不愁没啥烧。”
    男人去担炭，锄麦谁来干？支部研究的结果是：“必须教育与组织青壮年妇女下地劳动”。同时，也可为妇女全年参加农业主要劳动打下基础。因此决定由白凤英同志（妇女会主席、劳动英雄）与郭保明同志（农会主席）带领和组织妇女锄麦。开始组织起来到地里锄麦的妇女，有三十一个，东倒西歪的谁也不会锄。郭保明、白凤英两同志就积极想办法并耐心地教大家学锄地。郭保明想出：用牲口套上耠在前边按垅背，耠松土，使妇女们锄着省劲些。白凤英在前边锄，让大家后边看着。她一边锄，一边教大家：“右手在前气力大，下腰弓肩锄的深，蹬稳脚步不踏地，一人一行拉开些距离”。她还不时把锄放下，捉住不会锄的妇女的手和腿，指着手要捉那里，脚要踏到那里。这样在郭、白的组织领导下，又逐渐组织起三十个妇女锄麦。全村六天锄完八百亩（有男人参加，但主要是妇女），未锄的只有一百五十亩。由于组织了妇女参加锄麦，使全村锄麦提前完成。以前看不起妇女上地的人，也说：“妇女组织起来，就是不简单！”而学会锄地的妇女，也和以前不一样了！她们从地里回来后，谈论的问题，已不是什么张家长、李家短，而是和男人们站在一块儿，讨论着如何才能把地锄好了。
