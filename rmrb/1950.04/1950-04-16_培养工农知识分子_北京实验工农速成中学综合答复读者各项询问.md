To the Editor:
    Recently, our school has received many letters forwarded by various newspapers from readers inquiring about the nature and enrollment of our school. We now provide a comprehensive and brief response to these questions as follows:

    (1) The mission of our school is to absorb worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth, providing them with secondary-level cultural and scientific education, so that they can be promoted to universities or specialized schools for further studies, becoming strong backbones for the construction of New China (please refer to page 3 of the People's Daily on April 5).

    (2) This enrollment is being conducted by the personnel departments of central and Beijing municipal-level agencies, selecting supplied-system government workers who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years, possess a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate, are between the ages of 16 and 30, ideologically progressive, actively working, and in good health. They are only admitted after passing the school's entrance examination.

    (3) The treatment of students in our school: food, lodging, clothing, stationery, etc., are provided by the school.

    (4) The number of students for this term is full, and the enrollment for the next term has not yet been decided.

    (5) Our school is an experimental school, being run on a trial basis first. In the future, the Central People's Government will systematically and gradually establish such worker-peasant rapid middle schools in various regions, agencies, and troops. Worker-peasant youth and worker-peasant cadres who meet the above conditions will still have the opportunity to study.
