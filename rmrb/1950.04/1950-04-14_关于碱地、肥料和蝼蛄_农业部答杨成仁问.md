To the Editor:

　　My home is in Xiaoyi County, Shanxi. Some of the land there is alkaline, and the crops grown there do not do well. What methods can be used to improve it? Besides manure and fertilizer powder, what other substitutes are there for fertilizer? What methods can be used to prevent and control mole crickets? Please reply!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yang Chengren
Comrade Yang Chengren: Your questions have been answered by the Ministry of Agriculture as follows:

　　(1) The reason why crops do not grow well on alkaline land is that the soil contains too much alkali, which is not suitable for crop growth. There are many ways to improve alkaline soil. Here are a few simple and easy-to-implement methods:

　　(1) Ensure smooth drainage to reduce alkali in the soil. However, the drained water should be directed to areas where crops are not planted and not into areas where crops are already planted.

　　(2) Apply gypsum and then flush with water, which is more effective than the previous method.

　　(3) In early spring, when the weather is dry, alkali accumulates on the soil surface. At this time, scraping away the surface alkaline soil can reduce the concentration of alkali.

　　(4) Plant and apply green manure.

　　(5) If the alkalinity is not severe, crops with strong alkali resistance, such as millet, wheat, barley, cotton, hemp, and beets, can be planted.

　　(2) In addition to manure and fertilizer powder, there are quite a few other materials that can be used as fertilizer, such as oil cake (seed cake, sesame cake, cotton cake, peanut cake, soybean cake, etc.), fertile pond mud, river mud, green manure, kang (heated brick bed) soil, burned soil, sludge, bone meal, and the collection of all kinds of weeds, stubble, fallen leaves, and waste materials, which are piled up and rotted. All of these are very good fertilizers.

　　(3) Mole crickets are a very serious pest in North China. Last year, more than 280,000 mu were damaged in Pingyuan Province alone, and more than 380,000 mu were damaged in the whole of North China. Mole crickets have already begun to be active and should be controlled in a timely manner. Here are some of the most effective methods used in various regions last year:

　　Poisoned grain or poisoned bait killing method. There are currently two types of medicines used to make poisoned bait:

　　(1) One catty of millet or sorghum, one liang to one and a half liang of arsenic trioxide powder.

　　(2) One catty of millet or sorghum, one liang of sodium fluorosilicate (this medicine can be purchased from nearby farms).

Method: First cook the millet or sorghum until it is half-cooked, take it out and mix it with the medicine powder, dry it in the sun, and mix it with the seeds before sowing. The first method is a method that the villagers have used for many years. The second is a newly introduced medicine, which has been proven to be very effective by experimental fields and the villagers' application.

　　Pit trapping method: Pit trapping is a more effective method, because catching a female mole cricket in early spring can reduce the number of mole crickets in the future. The pit digging period should be carried out before the beginning of summer; it will be difficult to catch them if it is delayed until the awns of grain crops are visible. Dig pits in the field that are one chi (Chinese foot, about 1/3 meter) long, wide, and deep, with ten to fifteen pits per mu. The four walls of the pits should be smooth, and some horse manure should be placed at the bottom. In this way, mole crickets will run into the pits in search of food. Check once every morning, and you can catch many mole crickets.

　　Use a stone roller to compact: Mole crickets like to roll around in soft soil. When they encounter hard soil, they feel it is difficult. Therefore, after sowing, use a stone roller to compact the ridges two or three times to make it difficult for mole crickets to pass. However, it is not advisable to compact dicotyledonous plants (such as cotton, beans, and sesame) too many times.

　　关于碱地、肥料和蝼蛄——农业部答杨成仁问
    编辑同志：
    我家在山西孝义县，那里的土地有部分是碱地，种出农作物来成绩很不好。有何方法可以改造一下？肥料除用粪及肥田粉外，还有什么代用品？蝼蛄这种害虫有何方法可以防止和除治？请答复！
                                                      杨成仁杨成仁同学：你提的问题，已请农业部解答如下：
    （一）碱地种农作物长不好的原因，是由于土中含碱质过多，不适合农作物生长所致。改良碱土方法甚多，在这里介绍几个简单而易行的如下：
    （１）畅通排水，减轻土中碱质。但排出的水要设法使它流至不种作物地区，不要导入已种植作物地区。
    （２）施用石膏，然后放水冲洗，效果比前法较大。
    （３）早春干旱之时，碱质聚集土壤表面，此时将表面碱土刮走，可减少碱质的浓度。
    （４）种植及施用绿肥。
    （５）如碱性不重，可栽种抗碱性较强之作物如小米、小麦、大麦、棉、麻、甜菜等。
    （二）肥料除了粪及肥田粉外，其他可利用做肥料的颇不少，如油饼（籽子饼、芝麻饼、棉饼、花生饼、大豆饼等），肥沃的塘泥河泥、绿肥、炕土、烧土、污泥，骨粉，以及采集一切野草、残株、落叶、废物等堆积沤烂，都是很好的肥料。
    （三）蝼蛄在华北为害非常严重，去年平原一省有二十八万多亩被害，全华北则有三十八万多亩。目前蝼蛄已开始活动，即应及时防治。仅将去年各地最有效的方法介绍如下：
    毒谷或毒饵诱杀法。做毒饵的药，现在所用有两种：
    （１）小米或谷子一市斤，信石粉一市两至一市两半。
    （２）小米或谷子一市斤。氟矽酸钠一市两（此药可向各地附近农场购买）。制法：先把小米或谷子煮成半熟，捞出拌和药粉，晒干，拌于种子内下种。第一种方法是老乡们多年常用的方法，第二种是新介绍的一种药，经试验场证明和老乡们的施用都很有效。
    掘坑捕捉法：掘坑捕捉为较有效办法，因为在早春捉一雌蝼蛄就可减少将来若干个蝼蛄。掘坑时期，应在立夏前施行；迟至芒种，即不易捉获。在田中掘长、宽、深各一尺深的坑，每亩挖十至十五个，坑的四壁要光滑，下面放些马粪，这样蝼蛄因觅取食物就跑到坑里来，每天早晨检查一次，可捉到好多蝼蛄。
    用石砘镇压：蝼蛄喜欢在松软的土地里翻滚，逢着坚硬的土地，他是感觉困难的，所以在播种后要用石砘在垄间压二次或三次，使蝼蛄通行困难。但是双子叶植物（如棉、豆、芝麻）是不宜镇压次数过多的。
                                                  编者
