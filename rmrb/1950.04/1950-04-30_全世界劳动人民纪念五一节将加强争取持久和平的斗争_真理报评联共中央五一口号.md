　　Worldwide Laboring People Celebrate May Day
    Will Strengthen the Struggle for Lasting Peace
    Pravda Comments on the All-Union Communist Party's May Day Slogans
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th] TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda published an editorial on the 27th commenting on the May Day slogans released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating: The May Day slogans stipulate the tasks facing the Soviet people in the struggle for the further prosperity of the socialist motherland and for the victory of communism. May Day is a festival of unity for the working people of the world, a festival of fraternal solidarity for the workers of all countries, and this year, the banner commemorating May Day will be: further strengthening the struggle of all peace-loving people against the instigators of imperialist war and for lasting peace.
    The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful, constructive endeavors to build communism. At the same time, the Soviet people steadfastly defend the cause of peace throughout the world. The peace policy of the Soviet state, the wise Stalin's policy of friendship among all nationalities, has won the approval of all progressive humanity. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world are increasingly recognizing that defending peace is the common cause of all people in the world.
    The editorial continued: This year, the Soviet people are welcoming May Day with outstanding achievements in communist construction. The results of the economic plan implementation in the first quarter of this year brilliantly demonstrate the Soviet people's glorious new victories. The total industrial output in the first quarter of 1950 increased by 22 percent compared to the same period last year.
    On May Day, the working people of all countries, comparing the results of the development of the two systems, will be more convinced that the Soviet socialist economic system is infinitely superior to the capitalist system, which is doomed to perish.
    The editorial concluded: Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members stand at the forefront of the struggle to further consolidate the strength of the Soviet state. The Party of Lenin and Stalin unites and inspires the heroic Soviet people and leads them forward along the road of building a communist society.

    将加强争取持久和平的斗争
    真理报评联共中央五一口号
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十七日发表社论，评论苏联共产党中央委员会发布的五一口号称：五一口号规定了苏联人民在为社会主义祖国的进一步繁荣、为共产主义的胜利而进行的斗争中所面临的任务。五一节是全世界劳动人民团结的节日，是各国工人们兄弟般团结的节日，而在今年，纪念五一节的旗帜将是：进一步加强一切爱好和平的人民反对帝国主义战争挑拨者、和争取持久和平的斗争。
    苏联人民正从事于建设共产主义的和平的、建设性的努力，与此同时，苏联人民坚定不移地保卫着全世界的和平事业。苏维埃国家的和平政策，英明的斯大林各民族友好政策，获得了一切进步人类的赞同。全世界亿万的普通人民，已越来越深地认识到保卫和平乃是世界上一切人民的共同事业。
    社论继称：今年，苏联人民以共产主义建设中的卓越成就来迎接五一节。今年第一季执行经济计划的结果，光辉地证明了苏联人民辉煌的新胜利。一九五○年第一季的工业总产量，较去年同期增加了百分之二十二。
    在五一节，一切国家的劳动人民比较着两个制度发展的结果，将更加信服苏联的社会主义经济制度，无限优越于注定要灭亡的资本主义制度。
    社论结语称：共产党党员和共产主义青年团团员站在为进一步巩固苏维埃国家的力量而斗争的最前列。列宁与斯大林的党团结着和鼓舞着英勇的苏联人民，并且领导他们沿着建设共产主义社会的大道前进。
