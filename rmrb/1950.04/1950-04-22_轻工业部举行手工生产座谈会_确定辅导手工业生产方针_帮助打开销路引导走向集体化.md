Xinhua News Agency, April 20th – To assist handicraft production, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government convened a symposium on handicraft production in March, inviting representatives from relevant agencies, organizations, and experts. The meeting conducted in-depth discussions on the important role of handicrafts in China's national economy, the current situation and existing problems of handicrafts, and the guiding principles and priorities for assisting handicraft production in the future. In addition, special studies were conducted on methods for assisting handicraft textiles, papermaking, and arts and crafts industries. The symposium summarized the discussions on the above issues, and this summary has now been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. The Ministry of Light Industry has decided to establish a Handicraft Production Guidance Committee based on this summary, inviting relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Trade, the Central Cooperative Administration, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Culture to participate, in order to connect, communicate, plan, and guide the national handicraft production.

According to the discussions and summaries of the symposium, handicrafts still occupy a very important position in China's overall national economy. It is not only a sideline for the vast number of farmers, but also an important component of the economy in small and medium-sized cities. Due to the inadequacy of China's modern mechanized industry and inconvenient transportation, it cannot meet the needs of the daily necessities of the vast number of workers and peasants, so a large part of it still needs to rely on handicrafts to supply. At the same time, according to preliminary estimates, there are currently about 15 million to 20 million workers engaged in handicraft production in China, and more than 50 million people directly rely on it for their livelihoods. Therefore, assisting handicraft production is a serious issue related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

According to the current situation of handicrafts, the symposium believes that the key issue in restoring and developing handicraft production is the supply and sales issue. Only by opening up sales channels can production be effectively organized; and to open up sales channels, products must first meet social needs. Therefore, local state-owned trading agencies and cooperative marketing agencies should, as far as possible, use methods such as ordering, purchasing products, entrusting processing, and exchanging raw materials for finished products to lead and support handicraft production and help them find sales channels. State-owned trading agencies and cooperative marketing agencies must adopt various organizational forms in leading the supply and sales of handicraft products to organize small producers and gradually move from a scattered individual economy to a collective path, while also promoting the improvement of production technology. In terms of organizational forms, production teams can be organized for seasonal sideline businesses and family handicrafts in rural areas; independent handicraftsmen can organize production cooperatives; and small factories and workshops can organize joint operations. In assisting handicraft production, development should be in the following directions: (1) Combining with mechanical industry, such as manual cotton ginning and weaving should be coordinated with machine textile production, and manual pulp making should be coordinated with machine papermaking production; (2) Developing in departments where machine industry is insufficient, such as the current lack of packaging materials and the backwardness of the hemp spinning industry, it is possible to promote hand-woven hemp bags; (3) Combining with disaster relief work to promote various rural sideline productions; (4) Combining with international trade, such as the processing industry of agricultural products available for export; (5) Combining with troop production, such as part of the consumer goods for troops' own use can be solved by their own handicraft production.

Regarding the key points for promoting manual production, the symposium proposed that they should be determined based on the specific environment and conditions of various regions, according to the principles of (1) those with a foundation in the past and easier to restore now; (2) those on which the livelihoods of the vast number of people depend; (3) those that have economic value for promotion and future development prospects, but do not require huge investments at present. Local governments should first conduct investigations and research on the guidance of local key handicraft production, understand the specific situation, formulate practical and feasible methods, and consult with relevant institutions to solve their supply and sales problems, and then determine the production plan and guide the masses to organize production.

Regarding handicraft textiles, papermaking, and arts and crafts industries, after special studies by the symposium, it was believed that the shortage of machine-made yarn and cloth in China still requires the assistance of handicraft textiles in the short term, and handicraft textiles are an important sideline production in rural areas, so it should be given attention. However, the current domestic raw cotton is not enough for machine spinning, and the efficiency of hand spinning is too low, so it should not be promoted. Hand weaving still has the conditions for existence and development because it can utilize the surplus labor force in rural areas, and machine-woven fabrics are still insufficient. Local handicraft textile industries should utilize and restore the original production equipment under the leadership of the Cooperative Marketing General Cooperative and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to carry out planned production. As for manual papermaking, it should be coordinated with machine papermaking to produce art or special-purpose paper, such as Xuan paper, waxed paper, carbon paper blanks, or low-cost printing paper, such as Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper. Or organize Cao households to process bamboo and grass materials and supply them to nearby machine paper mills. For the manufacture of superstitious paper, guidance should be given to change it to other paper or pulp, etc. Regarding the production policy of the handicraft industry, it should be mainly for export and supplemented by domestic sales. In terms of business methods, it should move towards joint supply and sales, and the foreign sales business should be controlled by public or public-private joint professional institutions in order to unify specifications, inspect quality, and improve technology. The Ministry of Light Industry is preparing to establish a Handicraft Design Committee under the Handicraft Production Guidance Committee to supply various novel patterns and styles and assist in improving technology.

The summary of this symposium also called on various local and industry organizations to organize handicraft federations, gradually forming national federations to strengthen the unity and education of handicraftsmen and make handicrafts gradually develop along the path of cooperation or joint operations.

　　轻工业部举行手工生产座谈会
    确定辅导手工业生产方针
    帮助打开销路引导走向集体化
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府轻工业部为辅导手工业生产，曾于三月间邀集有关机关团体代表及专家，举行手工生产座谈会。会议对手工业目前在我国国民经济中所占重要地位、手工业的现状和存在的问题，以及今后对手工业生产的辅导方针和推行的重点，都作了深入的讨论。此外对于手工纺织、造纸、手艺工业的辅导办法并作了专题研究。座谈会对上述各问题的讨论曾做了总结，这一总结现已经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。轻工业部决定根据这一总结，成立手工生产指导委员会，邀集贸易部、中央合作管理局、纺织工业部、人民银行总行、文化部等有关机关参加，以联系、沟通、计划和指导全国的手工业生产。
    根据座谈会的讨论和总结，手工业目前在我国整个国民经济中，还占有很重要的地位，它不仅是广大农民的副业，在中小城市经济中，也是重要构成部分。由于中国近代化机械工业不足和交通不便，还不能适应广大工人农民的日常生活用品的需要，因此其中很大部分仍要依靠手工业来供应。同时据初步估计，我国目前从事手工业生产的工人，约计一千五百万至二千万人，直接赖以维持生活的，在五千万人以上，因此，辅导手工业生产问题，实为关系国计民生的严重的问题。
    按照目前手工业的状况，座谈会认为，恢复和发展手工业生产的关键问题是供销问题，只有打开销路，才能有效地组织生产；而要打开销路，首先必须使产品适合社会需要。因此，各地国营贸易机关和合作社供销机构，应尽可能利用订货、收购产品、委托加工、以原料换成品等方式领导和扶助手工业生产，帮助其找到销路。国营贸易机关和合作社供销机关在领导手工业产品供销业务上，必须采取各种组织形式把小生产者组织起来，使其由散漫的个体经济，逐渐走上集体化的道路，同时并推动其改进生产技术。在组织形式上，对农村中有季节性的副业和家庭手工业可以领导其组织生产小组；独立手工业者，可以组织生产合作社；对于小工厂与小作坊可组织联营。在辅导手工业生产时，应向下列几个方向发展，即：（一）与机械工业相结合，如手工轧花纺织应配合机器纺织生产，手工制纸浆配合机器造纸生产；（二）向机器工业不足的部门发展，如目前包装材料缺乏，而麻纺工业落后，即可提倡手织麻袋；（三）与救灾工作结合，推广各种农村副业生产；（四）与国际贸易结合，如可供出口的农产品加工工业；（五）与部队生产结合，如部队自用的消费品部分由自己手工生产解决。
    关于手工生产推行重点，座谈会提出应就各地具体的环境和条件，根据（一）过去已有基础，现在较易恢复者；（二）赖以解决广大人民生活者；（三）在经济上有提倡价值，将来有发展前途，而目前无需巨额投资者等原则而定。各地方政府对当地重点手工生产的辅导，应先进行调查研究，了解其具体情况后，拟定切实可行的办法，会同有关机构解决其供销问题，然后决定生产计划，指导群众组织生产。
    关于手工纺织、造纸和手艺工业，经座谈会进行专题研究后，认为我国机器纱布生产之不足，在短时期内还需要手工纺织来辅助，手工纺织又为农村重要的副业生产，故应予以重视。但目前国内原棉尚不敷机纺之用，手纺效能过低，不宜提倡。手织因其可利用农村剩余劳动力，且机织布匹还不敷供应，故仍有存在和发展的条件。各地手工纺织业应在合作供销总社和花纱布公司领导下，利用和恢复原有的生产设备，进行有计划的生产。至于手工造纸，应使与机器造纸配合起来，生产艺术或特种用纸，如宣纸、蜡纸，复写纸之纸胚或成本低廉的印刷纸张，如连史、毛边纸等。或组织槽户将竹料、草料加工，供给附近机器纸厂。对于迷信用纸的制造，应辅导其改制其他纸张，或制纸浆等。关于手工艺工业的生产方针，应以外销为主，内销为辅。在经营方式上，应走向供销联营，并由公营或公私合营专业机构掌握外销业务，以统一规格，检定品质，改进技术，轻工业部已准备在手工生产指导委员会下设一手工艺设计委员会，从事供应各种新颖图案式样及协助改进技术等。
    此次座谈会的总结中并号召各地方各行业间组织手工业联合会，逐步组成全国性的联合会，以加强手工业者的团结和教育工作，并使手工业逐渐同合作或联营的道路发展。
