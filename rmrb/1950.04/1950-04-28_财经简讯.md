　　In order to facilitate the payment of taxes by merchants and residents and to assist the tax bureau in completing its tax revenue tasks as soon as possible, the Chaigoubao branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to collect the 1950 first, second, and third month industrial and commercial tax and income tax for the Chaitown Tax Office, and has negotiated the following collection methods: 1. Each household will obtain a payment slip from the tax office to go to the bank to complete the payment procedures and exchange it for a formal tax receipt. If there is a deposit in the bank, you can directly issue a transfer voucher to the bank, and then exchange the voucher for a tax receipt, in order to reduce the trouble of counting money. From April 13th to 19th, a total of 535 households paid taxes, totaling 140,088,693 yuan, which has reached 98.7% of the total tax revenue. All industrial and commercial households in the town are satisfied with this collection method.
