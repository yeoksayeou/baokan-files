　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 4th: The Twelfth National Congress of the French Communist Party continued its meeting on the 3rd to discuss Thorez's report. Louet, secretary of the Paris Metal Industry Workers' Union Federation, Lanbin, secretary of the Nord Provincial Party Committee, Agasse, secretary of the Lower Charente Provincial Party Committee, Central Committee members Faron and Marty, and Aisne Provincial Party Committee secretary Renard all spoke enthusiastically.

　　Louet emphasized the need to develop and expand the actions and unity of the working masses when talking about the lessons of the metalworkers' strike movement. Lanbin, in reviewing the mistakes made by the Nord Provincial Party organization, stated: We adopted opportunism in handling certain issues and had economistic tendencies. We underestimated the importance of mass work. Our main mistake was that we did not sufficiently trust the broad masses and underestimated the vanguard role played by the working people in the struggle to win their economic and political demands and in the struggle for peace. Lanbin emphasized that in most textile factories in the Nord Province, not only are there no Party organizations, but in fact, there are no trade union organizations at all. So far, our main attention has been focused on establishing street organizations. Lanbin concluded by saying: The Nord Provincial Party organization will reorganize its work according to the requirements of the current stage.

　　Agasse, in his speech, emphasized the significant activities of the broad working people and the entire people of Lower Charente Province in defending peace and opposing war preparations. He said: Dockworkers at the Port of La Pallice have announced that they do not want to turn their seaport into a base for anti-Soviet aggression. The entire people support their activities, and not only enterprise workers, but also small merchants and farmers have expressed their solidarity with the dockworkers. Despite the authorities' intensified suppression of peace supporters, the struggle for peace in Lower Charente Province is expanding daily. Support for those who are persecuted is also increasing.

　　Faron urged that active work begin first in enterprise departments, attracting the broad masses to the struggle for peace and consolidating and expanding the work of Party organizations in enterprises.

　　Renard emphasized the need to strengthen theoretical and ideological education in Party organizations and to educate the broad masses from the perspective of political struggle. He thanked the Central Committee of the Communist Party for its timely criticism and correction of the mistakes made by the Party workers in Aisne Province, thereby helping the Party organization in the province.

　　Marty's speech mainly emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle to defend peace and oppose the Vietnam War. After Marty finished speaking, the meeting adjourned.

　　法共十二次全国代表大会讨论多列士报告
    强调应扩大劳动群众的团结
    坚决保卫和平反对侵越战争
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法国共产党第十二次全国代表大会三日继续举行会议，讨论多列士的报告。巴黎区五金工业工会联合会书记卢莱，诺尔省省委书记蓝彬，下夏朗德省省委书记阿加塞，中央委员法戎和马尔梯，艾斯纳省省委书记雷纳等人都热烈发言。
    卢莱谈到五金工人罢工运动的教训时着重指出：必须发展和扩大劳动群众的行动和团结。蓝彬检讨诺尔省党组织所犯的错误称：我们在处理若干问题时，采取了机会主义，并有经济主义的偏向。我们低估了群众工作的重要性，我们的主要错误就在于我们不够相信广大群众，低估了劳动人民在争取他们经济和政治要求的斗争中，争取和平的斗争中所起的先锋作用。蓝彬着重指出：在诺尔省的大多数纺织工厂中，不仅没有党的组织，并且实际上根本没有工会的组织。迄今为止，我们主要的注意力，都集中在建立街道组织上。蓝彬结束时说：诺尔省党组织将按照现阶段的要求而重新组织它的工作。
    阿加塞在讲话中，强调下夏朗德省的广大劳动人民和全体人民在保卫和平、反对战争准备的斗争中的重大活动。他说：拉巴利港的码头工人已经宣布，他们不要把他们的海港转变为反苏侵略基地。全体人民都支持他们的活动，不但企业工人，就是小商人和农民也表明了与码头工人的团结一致。尽管当局加紧镇压和平拥护者，但下夏朗德省争取和平的斗争却日益扩大。各处对于被迫害者的支持，也在日益增强。
    法戎敦促首先在企业部门中开始活跃的工作，吸引广大群众到和平斗争中来，进行巩固和扩大企业中党的组织工作。
    雷纳强调必须在党组织中加强理论的思想教育工作，并以政治斗争的观点，教育广大群众。他感谢共产党中央委员会对艾斯纳省党工作人员所犯的错误，予以及时的批评与纠正，从而帮助了该省的党组织。
    马尔梯的讲话主要强调必须加强保卫和平和反对越南战争的斗争。马尔梯讲话完毕后，会议即宣告休会。
