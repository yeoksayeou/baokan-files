　　Preventing Smallpox
　　Da Wen
　　Smallpox is a very serious and dangerous infectious disease that often occurs in the spring and winter. It is especially prevalent in the vast rural areas, where many people die from it, and children are particularly susceptible.

　　When infected with smallpox, a person initially experiences fever and chills, followed by a rash after three or four days. The rash first appears on the face and head, and spreads throughout the body in about two or three days. The rash gradually turns into pus-filled blisters, as large as peas. At this stage, the patient's skin exhibits edema, and the face may swell, making it difficult to recognize them. This is the most painful stage, and when life is most at risk. Around the tenth to twelfth day after the rash appears, the blisters gradually dry up and scab over. This causes intense itching all over the body, and it takes three to four weeks for the scabs to fall off, leaving behind a scar, commonly known as a pockmark. Smallpox can sometimes affect the eyes, potentially leading to blindness.

　　The pathogen of smallpox is a microorganism called a filterable virus. This microorganism is extremely small and invisible under ordinary microscopes. It is highly contagious. The nasal and oral secretions of smallpox patients contain this virus. Healthy individuals can be infected simply by sitting opposite a patient. Objects used by patients can also be contaminated with the smallpox virus, and contact with such objects can lead to infection. The air in the rooms where smallpox patients reside contains the smallpox virus, so there is a high risk of infection when passing through such rooms.

　　If infected with smallpox, in addition to seeking treatment from a doctor with appropriate medication, the first step should be strict isolation of the patient. The isolation period should last from the onset of the disease until the scabs have completely fallen off. The patient should remain completely bedridden from the onset of the illness until four or five days after the symptoms subside. The patient should drink plenty of boiled water, especially when experiencing a fever. Semi-liquid foods are most suitable for consumption. If there are ulcers in the throat and mouth, liquid foods should be consumed. To prevent the patient's rash from being infected by other bacteria, clothing and bedsheets should be changed and washed frequently to maintain cleanliness.

　　Although smallpox is a very serious infectious disease, it is not to be feared. As long as vaccination is widely promoted, it will be the most effective way to prevent smallpox. In the era of Tsarist Russia, many people suffered from smallpox every year. Now, thanks to the Soviet government's implementation of mandatory vaccination, smallpox has almost disappeared in the Soviet Union. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government in China did not pay much attention to these matters, so smallpox was very prevalent every year. The current People's Government cares about the health of the people and pays special attention to vaccination. Vaccination is one of the central tasks of spring prevention work. As long as everyone is vaccinated with cowpox, smallpox can be eradicated.

　　预防天花
    大文
    天花是很严重很危险的一种传染病，每年春天和冬天时常流行，特别是在广大农村里，因天花死亡的人是很多的，其中尤以小孩子最易传染。
    传染了天花，开始发热、恶寒，三四天发疹，最初在面部和头部，约二三天后即可蔓延全身。疹子渐渐化脓成泡，脓泡大如豌豆。这时病人皮肤有水肿现象，面部有时肿胀，令人不易辨认，感觉非常痛苦，生命发生危险多在此时。在发疹后的第十到十二天，脓泡即渐渐干燥结痂。这时病人发生全身奇痒，需三至四星期痂皮才能脱落，遗留一个瘢痕（疤）这就是普通说的麻子。天花有时也发生在眼睛上，说不定要变成瞎子。
    天花的病原是一种微生物，叫做泸过性病毒。这种微生物非常小，用普通的显微镜看不见。它的传染性很强，天花病人的口鼻分泌物内含有这种病毒，无病的人与病人对坐，就可能被传染；病人使用的物件，都可被天花泸过性病毒沾污，如果与这种东西接触也可能被传染。天花病人住室内的空气中，浮游着天花泸过性病毒，所以经过病室很有被传染的可能。
    如果传染了天花，除了延请医生施以对症药物疗法外，一般的首先应当把病人严格隔离。隔离期限应当从得病起一直到痘痂完全脱落为止。病人从得病起，到病状消退后四五日止，应当完全卧床休养；病人应当多喝开水，发热的时候更应多喝；吃的东西以半流质食品为最适当；如果咽喉和口腔内有痘疹溃疡时，应当吃流质食品。为了预防病人的痘疹受其它病菌的传染，衣服被单等应当常常换洗以保持清洁。
    天花虽然是一种很严重的，但传染病并不可怕，只要能普遍的推行种痘，便是预防天花最有效的办法。在帝俄时代，俄国每年害天花的人很多；现在由于苏联政府实行了强制种痘，苏联国内，天花几乎已经绝迹了。我们中国过去国民党反动政府，对于这些事是不大注意的，所以每年天花流行得很厉害。现在的人民政府是关心人民健康的，对种痘也特别注意。种痘是春季预防工作的中心之一。只要大家都种牛痘，天花是可以消灭的。
