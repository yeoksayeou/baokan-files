　　Soviet Spring Planting Campaign Widely Unfolded
    National Crop Sowing Increased by One and a Half Times Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    Soviet Union Has the World's Highest Level of Machine Cultivation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch] TASS, Moscow dispatch: The Soviet spring planting campaign is underway across the country. In Ukraine, Moldova, the Don and Kuban regions, in the Central Asian republics, and in Transcaucasia, spring crops have already been sown on millions of hectares of vast fields. This year's agricultural work is being carried out more successfully than in 1949. As of March 25, the total industrial and other crops sown by collective farms and individual farmers nationwide have increased by one and a half times compared to the same period in 1949.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch] TASS, Moscow, March 30th: The "Truth" newspaper recently published an editorial discussing the activities of machine and tractor stations in the increasingly large-scale spring field work, pointing out that the Soviet Union's level of using powered cultivation is second to none in the world, and the technical level of agriculture is also gradually improving. In the past year, the number of machine and tractor stations and machine and tractor maintenance stations has increased significantly. As of this spring, the number of 15-horsepower tractors has increased by 22 percent compared to last spring. This year, the total amount of tractor work on collective farms will increase by 17 percent compared to last year. 85-90 percent of all cultivation and more than 60 percent of sowing work will be completed by tractors from machine and tractor stations. Due to the significant increase in the level of agricultural mechanization in 1949, the role of machine and tractor stations in increasing harvests, developing agriculture, and consolidating collective farms economically and organizationally will further increase.

　　苏联春播运动广泛展开
    全国农作物播种较去年同期增加一倍半
    机器耕作水平苏联是世界第一
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联春播运动正在全国开展中。在乌克兰、摩尔达维亚、顿河州与库班州，在中亚细亚各共和国以及在外高加索等数百万公顷广袤的田地上，已首先播种了春季农作物。今年的农田工作较一九四九年更为成功地进行着。截至三月二十五日为止，总计全国集体农场与个体农场所播种的工业及其他农作物，已较一九四九年同一时期内增加了一倍半。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三月三十日讯：真理报顷发表社论，论述机器与拖拉机站在规模愈来愈大的春季田间工作中的活动，指出苏联使用动力耕作的水平，在全世界是首屈一指的，农业的技术水平，也在逐渐提高。在去年一年内，机器与拖拉机站以及机器与拖拉机保养场的数目已大量增加。截至今春为止，十五匹马力的拖拉机数目，已较去年春天增加了百分之二十二。今年，集体农场的拖拉机工作总量，将较去年增加百分之十七。全部耕作的百分之八十五——九十和播种工作的百分之六十以上，将由机器与拖拉机站的拖拉机来完成。由于一九四九年农业机械化水平的大大提高，机器与拖拉机站在增加收获量，发展农业和从经济上与组织上巩固集体农场方面的作用，将更为增加。
