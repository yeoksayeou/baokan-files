The People's Government of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province,
    Smashes Large-Scale Spy Organization
    Bandits Zhuge Yumin and More Than Twenty Others Arrested
    [Our Newspaper] The People's Government of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, recently smashed a large-scale bandit spy organization. Bandits Zhuge Yumin (Director of the Political Work Department of the Ouhai Column of the Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army), Chen Yuzhang (Chief of Staff of the Wenling Detachment), Lin Wenzhao (Secretary-General of the Wenling Detachment), Cao Yuting, Chen Wei'yue, Wang Chuanlin (all Directors of the Political Work Department of the Brigade), Jin Lianming (Staff Officer), Wu Zhongjie, Xu Chengbo, Ren Junjian (all Company Commanders), Lin Xiaoyu (Squad Leader), Chen Yiwen (Instructor), as well as more than twenty other bandit secretaries, intelligence officers, liaison officers, and harborers were all arrested. On February 27th, just as tens of thousands of people in the urban area gathered to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, spies lurking in the urban area took the opportunity to hold a secret meeting, which was detected by the County People's Government. They were all arrested, and a series of spy organizations were also smashed. In order to overcome the麻痹(mabi - careless) mindset of the staff and raise the people's vigilance, the County People's Government held an anti-bandit and anti-special agent conference in the old Confucius Temple on March 11. People from all walks of life expressed extreme resentment against the heinous crimes of the bandits and special agents and unanimously demanded that the government severely punish them. At the meeting, Director Ma of the Public Security Bureau and Deputy County Chief Zhu called on people from all walks of life to raise their vigilance, strengthen their organizations, and assist the government in eliminating all hidden enemies; and to strengthen production, support the front lines, liberate the Zhoushan Islands, Taiwan, and Tibet as soon as possible, and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits.
