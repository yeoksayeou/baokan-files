The cotton seed strain promotion and management work in the North China region in the first year after the complete liberation of North China has given us a lot of experience and lessons, which can be used as a reference for this year.

	I. Selection of Promotion and Propagation Areas

In 1949, the sown area of improved varieties in the Tianjin area was 43,498 mu, but due to drought, alkali, and floods, the abandoned area reached 88.7%; while in the Handan area, the sown area of improved varieties was 24,841 mu, and the harvested area was 24,229 mu, with an abandonment rate of less than 2.5%. With the same propagation, in Shijiazhuang, Handan and other places, an average of 200 jin of seed cotton could be harvested per mu, while in Beijing, Tianjin, Langfang and other areas, due to floods, the average yield of seed cotton per mu was at most 73 jin (Junliangcheng Cotton Farm) and at least 24 jin (Daxing); moreover, the proportion of frost-affected flowers in Handan accounted for only 15% of the total output, while in Tongxian and Daxing it accounted for 45%, and in Langfang and Baxian it was as high as 60%. Although the results of 1949 were not normal, experience tells us that in order to ensure the results of promotion, the propagation of fine purebreds must be placed in areas with reliable harvests and the most favorable conditions for cotton planting, so as to ensure its safety and maximize its propagation role.

	II. The Promoted New Cotton Varieties Must Be Significantly Better Than the Local Original Cotton Varieties

Although the Si Zi 2B cotton promoted by the Cotton Production Improvement Office in various places in 1949 was mostly successful, it failed in Shijiazhuang City. Shijiazhuang City used to be the original seed farm for the promotion of Si Zi No. 4 cotton during the enemy and puppet period, and it still retains a fairly good foundation. We did not have enough understanding of this beforehand, and transported a large amount of Si Zi 2B cotton for promotion, which was not welcomed by the local people. Therefore, a full understanding of the local original cotton varieties in advance – an investigation of varieties and yields, an examination of quality and purity, as well as adaptive tests and demonstration verifications of new varieties – are essential preparations.

	III. Seed Farms Are the Foundation for Promoting New Varieties

Before new varieties are widely promoted in various places, they must go through a certain propagation process, which should be done by seed farms. On the one hand, they can concentrate on cultivation and management, strictly remove false and refine selections, effectively increase the quantity of improved varieties, and maintain and improve the quality of improved varieties; on the other hand, they can confirm the adaptability of new varieties and at the same time play a role in demonstration and verification, arousing the public's understanding and confidence in them. Therefore, the work of seed farms is the foundation for promoting new varieties. The Si Zi 2B cotton variety promoted last year did not have the foundation of seed farms in the past, and the large-scale propagation resulted in a rapid decline in the quality of the seeds, which greatly affected the effect of promotion.

	IV. The Necessity of Centralized Promotion and Management

The preservation of cotton seed strains is more difficult than that of general edible crops. First, cotton is a crop that is easily hybridized. Second, cotton is almost purely for commercial production and must be processed. Therefore, the preservation of cotton seed strains must have strong organizational and management work to avoid mixing and degradation. Under our current decentralized small-scale peasant economy, the large-scale propagation and preservation of cotton seed strains must rely on the masses. When promoting excellent cotton varieties, designate areas and villages with better conditions, delineate improved variety management areas, organize the masses, concentrate on planting one type of cotton, and send resident technical cadres to conduct dedicated guidance and management, thereby increasing the quantity of improved varieties and continuing to expand promotion. Facts have proved that the establishment of improved variety management areas is completely correct and very necessary. For example, Tongxian, Cheng'an, Nangong, Xiajin, and Lixian counties have achieved good results because they have achieved centralized promotion and management. In Qingyuan, 4,667 mu of improved variety cotton fields were scattered in 21 villages, and the tens of thousands of mu of improved varieties in the Shijiazhuang guidance area were also widely dispersed. In the case of not being able to concentrate on promotion and management, farmers in the same village could not completely change varieties, and some households even planted two kinds of cotton at the same time, and some even mixed improved varieties with local cotton varieties, or replanted other cotton varieties due to the lack of seedlings in the improved variety cotton fields. As a result, not only was the quality of the improved varieties greatly reduced, but also the quantity of improved varieties was lost a lot. In Qingyuan, only 45,000 jin could be collected centrally in 1949. In the Shijiazhuang guidance area, most of the thousands of mu of improved varieties promoted in various counties other than the urban area were also lost. In addition, the experience of 1949 tells us that if we want to concentrate on promoting and managing improved varieties in a new area, it is difficult to get the masses to generally change varieties and establish improved variety management areas if we do not first go through demonstration and verification to obtain the deep understanding and acceptance of confidence of the local people. It is difficult for the masses to easily abandon their original cotton varieties, especially the cotton varieties retained by cotton farmers that are relatively good in the local area, and entrust their year's production to new varieties that they think are uncertain.

	V. Pay Attention to Checking the Germination Rate and Quality of Improved Varieties

Most of the Si Zi 2B improved cotton seeds distributed in 1949 were propagated by promotion farmers in the Beijing-Tianjin area. The climate was cold and the maturity was not very good. In addition, the grading and inspection were not strict when harvesting and ginning, and the sorting and storage were not proper. Therefore, the germination rate was generally not high and the quality was very uneven. We did not have enough time to pay attention to inspection in advance, and the germination test was also carried out very late. After the promotion, in some places in Shijiazhuang and Baoding areas, due to the mixed cotton seeds and poor germination, it caused serious resentment among the masses, and encountered many difficulties in the work, destroying and confusing a lot of improved variety areas, and creating a prejudiced view of suspicion and contempt for improved varieties. It was not until the mature harvest period that most of the masses' faith in improved variety cotton was restored. Therefore, in the future promotion of improved varieties, we must pay attention to checking and trying to improve the germination rate and quality of improved varieties, and we must achieve mature harvest, separate harvest, separate drying, separate storage, separate sales, separate ginning, and fine selection of seeds, and conduct indoor inspections and germination tests in areas with conditions to determine appropriate guidance standards. Only by properly grasping the germination rate and quality of improved varieties can the promotion work proceed steadily without encountering failure.

	VI. Selecting Good and Separating Harvest Movement

The Si Zi 2B cotton seeds we received were already quite mixed, which caused some comrades to doubt the excellent quality of the Si Zi 2B cotton. In order to maintain the excellent quality of Si Zi 2B cotton and ensure the increase in production of good cotton this year, we attempted to launch a movement to remove impurities and inferior products, but this method required the removal of 30% to 40% of the cotton plants, which was too much loss for the masses, and the state could not afford this huge loss compensation fee, so it could not be implemented. Therefore, it was decided to launch a movement to select good and separate harvests in the 200,000 mu of Si Zi 2B cotton fields that had been promoted, and a cotton production work team was organized. They went to various improved variety management areas, combined with the promotion teams of agricultural farms in various regions and the local governments, to carry out the selection and separation of improved varieties, respectively investigate different situations, mobilize and organize the masses to carry out whole field seed retention, separate harvest of mixed and inferior products, and select plant seed retention, and cooperate with high-priced purchases of selected cotton. As a result, the quality of improved varieties was improved. We believe that if such practices continue to be widely promoted, the excellent quality of improved varieties can not only be maintained, but also improved.

	VII. Organize Self-Seed Retention

In the past, cotton production improvement work mostly distrusted the masses' ability to maintain improved varieties. Every year, they focused on collecting improved variety cotton centrally after the autumn, processing it through publicly owned or specially contracted ginneries, and then lending the cotton seeds to the masses. They did not pay much attention to guiding farmers to retain seeds themselves. Therefore, the promotion of improved varieties did not take root, and the achievements of improving cotton varieties were intermittent and could not establish a solid foundation. This year, we have universally organized and guided the masses' self-seed retention in all improved variety promotion areas, which has been welcomed by the vast majority of the masses. Most of the masses have mastered the seed selection technology and selected pure seed cotton for seed retention. According to the results of the investigation, the self-retained seeds selected and collected by farmers in Tongxian and Wu'an and other places are generally of good quality, especially the germination rate has greatly increased, which provides an important guarantee for this year's seedling emergence. The facts in 1949 prove that organizing self-seed retention is the most effective way to consolidate the promotion foundation and maintain the quality of improved varieties.

	VIII. Improving Varieties Should Be Combined with Guidance on Cultivation Techniques and Prevention and Control of Diseases and Insect Pests

Some places regard the promotion of improved varieties as a simple variety change work, and fail to pay attention to the simultaneous cooperation with general guidance work such as cultivation techniques and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. For example, Zhengding and other places still habitually use small-distance cultivation of American cotton, only distributing Si Zi 2B cotton seeds to farmers, but not correcting this inappropriate cultivation technique? In this way, the promotion value of improved varieties will naturally not have good results. The promotion of improved varieties should not only be combined with the improvement of cultivation techniques and attention to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, but also should not ignore cotton field improvement and even the farming system. In some areas, land utilization and diseases and insect pests basically limit cotton production. Without overcoming these difficulties, it is impossible to fully achieve the task of increasing production by simply improving cotton varieties. Therefore, the promotion of improved varieties must carefully study the local agricultural conditions, understand the cotton production conditions, and promote the improvement of cotton varieties in conjunction with the entire cotton production improvement work.

### 华北区去年棉花良种推广管理工作

　　华北区去年棉花良种推广管理工作
    华北全部解放后第一年的棉花良种推广和管理工作，给了我们不少的经验和教训，可作为今年的参考。
            一、推广繁殖地区的选择
    一九四九年天津区良种播种面积四三、四九八亩，由于旱、碱、水灾等，废弃的面积达百分之八十八点七；而邯郸区良种播种面积二四、八四一亩，收获面积有二四，二二九亩，废弃面积不到百分之二点五。同样的繁殖：在石家庄、邯郸等地，每亩平均可收二百斤籽棉，而在京津廊坊等区，由于水灾平均每亩籽棉产量最高七十三斤（军粮城棉场），最少只二十四斤（大兴）；而且霜后花的成数，在邯郸仅占全产量的百分之十五，通县、大兴则占到百分之四十五，廊坊、霸县更高达百分之六十。一九四九年的结果虽不是正常的情形，但经验告诉我们，为了保证推广的成果，优良纯种的繁殖，必须摆在收获可靠及对植棉最有利的地区，以保障它的安全使之发挥最大的繁种作用。
            二、推广的新棉种必须显著的比当地原有棉种好
    去年一九四九年棉产改进处在各地推广的斯字二Ｂ棉，虽然大部获得成功，但在石家庄市则遭到失败。石家庄市过去是敌伪时期推广斯字四号棉的原种圃，现仍保留有相当好的基础，我们对此因为事前没有足够的了解，把斯字二Ｂ棉运去大量推广，以致不受当地群众的欢迎。因此事先对当地原有棉种情况的充分了解——对品种和产量的调查，品质和纯杂的考查，以及新种的适应试验和示范表证，都是必不可少的准备。
            三、繁种场是推广新种的基础
    新种在各地大量推广前，必须经过一定繁种的过程，这应该由繁种场去做，一方面可以集中栽培管理，严格去伪精选，有效地增加良种数量，保持和提高良种品质；一方面可以证实新种适应情形，同时发生着示范表证作用，引起群众对他的认识和信心。所以繁种场的工作，乃是推广新种的基础。去年推广的斯字二Ｂ棉种，因为过去没有繁种场的基础，大地繁殖的结果使种籽的品质迅速降低，因此大大影响到推广的效果。
            四、集中推广管理的必要
    棉花良种的保持，较一般食用作物困难，第一棉花是容易杂交的作物，第二棉花几乎为纯商品生产，须经过加工，所以棉花良种的保持，必须有强有力的组织与管理工作，以避免混杂退化。在我们目前分散的小农经济条件下，棉花良种的大量繁殖和保持必须依靠群众。优良的棉种开始推广时，划定条件较好的区村，划定良种管理区，组织群众，集中种植一种棉花，派驻技术干部，进行专责的指导和管理，由此增殖出多量的良种，继续扩大推广。事实证明：良种管理区的设置，是完全正确和十分必要的，如通县、成安、南宫、夏津、蠡县等地，都因做到集中推广管理，获得良好的成绩。清苑，四、六六七亩良种棉田便散布了二十一个村庄，石家庄指导区的一万几千亩良种也是分散很广，在不能集中推广管理的情形下，同一村内的农户做不到完全换种，甚至有一户兼种两种棉花的，更有把良种和当地棉种混播、或因良种棉田缺苗补播其他棉种的，因之不但良种品质大大降低，而且良种数量也散失很多。清苑一九四九年可能集中收回的，只有四万五千斤，石家庄指导区除市区以外，其他各县推广的几千亩良种也大部散失。此外，一九四九年的经验告诉我们：良种要到一个新的地区去集中推广管理，如果不先经过示范表证，取得当地群众的深切认识和接受的信心，而要群众普遍换种，成立良种管理区，也是很难办到的。群众不会轻易放弃他们原来种惯了的棉种，尤其是棉农保留的在当地比较好的棉种，使他们一年的生产寄托给认为没有把握的新种，这是相当困难的。
            五、注意检查良种的发芽率和品质
    一九四九年分发的斯字二Ｂ良种棉籽，大部是在京津区由推广农家繁殖出来的，气候较冷，成熟度不太好，加之收花轧花时分级检验不严格，整理储藏也欠妥善，因之发芽率一般都不高，品质也很参差，我们事先未有充分的时间去注意检查，发芽试验也进行得很迟，推广出去以后，在石家庄区、保定区一些地方，即由于棉种较杂和发芽不佳，引起群众的严重反感，工作上遭到很多困难，毁弃和混乱了不少的良种面积，且对于良种发生怀疑和轻视的成见，直到成熟收获期，才大部挽回了群众对良种棉花的信仰。所以今后推广良种，必须注意检查和设法提高良种的发芽率和品质，要做到熟收、分收、分晒、分存、分售、分轧以及种籽的精选，并在有条件地区举行室内考查和发芽试验，以定出适宜的指导标准。唯有好好掌握了良种的发芽率和品质，推广工作才能稳步进行，不致遭到失败。
            六、选良分收运动
    我们接收的斯字二Ｂ棉种，已经相当的混杂，引起一部分同志对斯字二Ｂ棉本质优良的怀疑。我们为保持斯字二Ｂ棉的优良品质，保证今年良棉的增产，曾企图发动去杂去劣，但这种办法，须拔去棉株的百分之三十到四十，群众损失太大，国家又无法开支这一笔庞大的损失补偿费，以致未能行通，于是，即决定在已推广的二十万亩斯字二Ｂ棉田内，发动选良分收运动，组织了棉产工作团。分赴各良种管理区，结合各地区农场的推广队及当地政府，进行良种的选种分收工作，分别查清不同情况，发动与组织群众，进行全田留种、杂劣分收、与选株留种，并配合以高价收买选种棉花，结果使良种质量提高了。我们认为像这样的做法，如继续普遍的推行，对于良种的优良品质，不但可以保持，而且还会有所增进。
            七、组织自留种
    过去的棉产改进工作，大都不信任群众会保持良种，每年都着重在秋后把良种棉花集中收回，经过公营的或特约的轧花厂加工后，再把棉籽贷给群众；不很注重指导农民自留种，因此良种推广生不了根，改良棉种的成绩时断时续，不能建立稳固的基础。我们今年在所有良种推广区内，普遍的组织和指导了群众的自留种，受到了广大群众的欢迎。多数群众都能掌握了选种技术，选出纯正的籽棉留种。据考查的结果，通县武安等地农民选收的自留种，一般质量都很好，特别是发芽率大为增高，对今年捉苗有了重要的保证。一九四九年的事实证明，组织自留种是巩固推广基础和保持良种质量的最有效的办法。
            八、改良品种要与栽培技术防治病虫害指导相结合
    有些地方将良种推广看作单纯的换种工作，对于栽培技术，防治病虫害等一般指导工作，未能同时注意配合作好；如正定等地一般还习用小距离栽培美棉，仅发给农民斯字二Ｂ棉种，而不去纠正这个不适当的栽培技术？这样良种的推广价值，自不会有好结果。推广良种，不但同时要配合着去改进栽培技术和注意防治病虫害，而且对于棉田改良以至耕作制度都不应忽视，有些地区土地利用和病虫害基本上限制着棉花的生产，不去克服这些困难，单凭改良棉种是决不能完满达成增产任务的。所以推广良种必须详细研究当地农情，了解棉花生产条件，将改良棉种结合着整个棉产改进工作向前推进。
