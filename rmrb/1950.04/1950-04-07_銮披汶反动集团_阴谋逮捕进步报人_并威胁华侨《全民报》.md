Xinhua News Agency, 6th: A delayed dispatch from Bangkok: According to a report in the Thai newspaper "San Yai Bao" in early March: The Luang Phibuns ruling clique of Thailand, which is increasingly relying on American imperialism, will soon announce an "Anti-Communist Ordinance" and, simultaneously with the announcement of the ordinance, will arrest a large number of journalists from Thai and foreign language newspapers who are deemed to be taking an "opposing stance." The blacklist of journalists planned for arrest is already in the hands of a senior police officer. According to "Lak Chat Bao," the Thai government has drafted a plan for this mass arrest and will first arrest journalists from five Thai and Chinese newspapers with large circulations.

On March 9, Nai Chamrat, Deputy Inspector General of the Special Department of the Thai government, met with the person in charge of the "Quan Min Bao," a Chinese newspaper in Bangkok, and made unreasonable threats under the pretext of "not promoting communism in the future."

    阴谋逮捕进步报人
    并威胁华侨《全民报》
    【新华社六日讯】曼谷迟到消息：据泰文《真言报》三月初报道：日益投靠美国帝国主义的泰国銮披汶统治集团，最近将宣布“反共条例”，并准备与宣布该条例同时，大批逮捕被指为站在“反对立场”的泰文及外文报社的报人。计划逮捕的新闻工作者的黑名单，已在某高级警官的手里。据《叻猜报》载，泰国政府已将此次大拘捕的计划拟就，并将首先拘捕销路广大的五家泰文及中文报的报人。
    三月九日，泰国政府特别部副总巡警上校乃针叻曾约见曼谷华侨主办的《全民报》主持人，以“今后不要宣传共产主义”为辞，进行无理威胁。
