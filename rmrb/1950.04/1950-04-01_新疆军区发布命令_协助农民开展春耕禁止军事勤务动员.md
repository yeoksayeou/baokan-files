Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 30th -- The Xinjiang Military Region issued an order on the 25th of this month regarding "Prohibiting all military service mobilization and vigorously assisting the people in carrying out spring planting." The order requires all agencies and troops, in addition to actively engaging in production and not hindering mass production, to also publicize and encourage the masses' enthusiasm for production. When poor farmers encounter difficulties such as a lack of seeds and farm implements, they should cooperate with the government to find ways to purchase or manufacture them, or borrow from landlords and rich peasants, and mobilize middle peasants to help each other, so that they can return the items after the autumn harvest, ensuring they do not miss the agricultural season and complete spring planting. The order stipulates: starting from the 28th, all mobilization of civilian labor, animal power, and other agricultural implements is strictly prohibited. All military service tasks should be borne by the troops themselves, preventing any actions by troops that may harm the interests of the masses due to production activities.

　　新疆军区发布命令
    协助农民开展春耕禁止军事勤务动员
    【新华社迪化三十日电】新疆军区本月二十五日发布关于“禁止一切军事勤务动员、助民大力展开春耕”的命令。命令要求各机关部队，除积极进行生产，不得防碍群众生产外，并应宣传鼓励群众生产的积极性；遇有贫苦农民缺乏种籽、农具等困难时，即应协同政府设法为其购制或向地主富农借贷及发动中农相互帮助，秋后归还，使其不失农时，完成春耕播种。命令规定：自二十八日起，一律禁止动员民力、畜力及其他农具，一切军事勤务应自行担负，防止各部队因为生产而发生损害群众利益的行为。
