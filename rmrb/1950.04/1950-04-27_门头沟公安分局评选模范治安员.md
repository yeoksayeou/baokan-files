　　Mentougou Public Security Sub-bureau Selects Model Public Security Officers
    [Our Dispatch] Last winter, in order to more closely connect with the masses and complete the task of protecting the lives and property of the people, the Mentougou Public Security Sub-bureau of Beijing Municipality, with the police station as a unit, selected a group of activists from the masses as public security officers and established a mass public security organization - the public security group. For the past six months, under the correct leadership and constant education of the Mentougou Public Security Sub-bureau, they have played a certain role in assisting the public security bureau's public security work.
    In order to strengthen the public security group and improve their work enthusiasm, the Mentougou Public Security Sub-bureau held a model public security group and public security officer selection campaign in mid-March, selecting one special-class model group and eight first-class model groups; one special-class model officer, thirty-one first-class model officers, thirty-one second-class model officers, and six third-class model officers. Yang Chunlin, the public security officer selected as a special-class model, is a small merchant. He assisted the Public Security Bureau in capturing eight secret agents and fifteen scattered soldiers (including five officers above the company or platoon level); he also solved a theft case, successfully mediated four civil disputes, and discovered a clue in a opium smoking case. In addition, he often helped residents solve difficulties and was also a model in obeying government laws and decrees.
    After this model selection campaign, the enthusiasm of the public security officers has been generally improved, and some groups have already put forward competitive challenges to each other.

    门头沟公安分局为加强治安小组力量，提高其工作积极性，曾于三月中旬举行模范治安组及治安员评选运动，选出一个特等模范组，八个甲等模范组；一个特等模范员，三十一个甲等模范员，三十一个乙等模范员，六个丙等模范员。被选为特等模范的治安员杨春林，是一个小商人，他曾协助公安局查获特务八名，散兵游勇十五名（其中连排长以上者五名）；并曾破获窃案一起，完满调解民事纠纷四起，查出烟毒案线索一起。此外，他经常帮助居民解决困难，并且还是服从政府法令的模范。
