　　Trade Treasury Established for One Month
    State-Owned Specialized Companies in Beijing Submit Over 60 Billion in Cash
    [Our Newspaper News] Reporter Jin Yu reports: After the establishment of the Beijing branch of the Trade Treasury, ten specialized branches and sub-companies in Beijing dealing with grain, cotton yarn, general merchandise, coal and iron, oils and fats, salt, eggs, pig bristles, fur, and local produce, remitted a total of over 66.2 billion yuan in cash into the treasury in March. Among the specialized companies, in addition to the general merchandise company exceeding 10 billion in sales, the grain and cotton yarn companies, among others, have completed more than half of their planned currency recall targets. Due to the vigorous promotion of goods by the specialized companies, a considerable amount of currency has been recalled; at the same time, due to the deposit of cash into the treasury, decentralized individual purchases have been stopped, overcoming the blindness of putting cash into the market. This has directly and indirectly played a role in stabilizing prices.
    The implementation of this system has also brought about new improvements in the business operations of the companies: (1) It has initially increased the planning of the specialized companies' operations. In the past, the business plans of the companies were mostly based on the situation of their own units, not only with great flexibility but also without taking the overall situation into account. The plans set this time must be carefully calculated based on the overall policy. Some companies have revised their plans several times because they were not practical enough. The cotton yarn company, among others, held special meetings to conduct thorough research in order to formulate their plans. Some cadres felt that today's plans were too difficult to set. They said: In the past, plans were easy to set and would not be criticized, but that is not the case today! However, most cadres have realized in more than a month of practice that formulating accurate and practical financial and business plans is the first step in enhancing planning. (2) The modes and methods of business operation of the specialized companies have also greatly changed. Because if business is not further developed, the task of currency recall cannot be completed. In March, the cotton yarn and coal and iron companies, among others, dispatched business personnel to strengthen rural sales. The general merchandise and grain companies, among others, added branches and sub-stores. Some companies have extended business hours and tried to simplify purchasing and payment procedures in order to sell more goods. The long-standing idea among business cadres of the specialized companies that "there is no worry about selling goods if there is stock" has begun to change. (3) After the change in business policy, some specialized companies have begun to earnestly economize on operating expenses to reduce expenditures. For example, the cotton yarn company uses waste materials (iron hoops, hemp ropes, wrapping cloths, etc.) to pack raw cotton or colored cloth, and the general merchandise company has reduced a large amount of start-up costs when opening branches and sub-institutions.
    After the implementation of the cash deposit system, some urgent problems have been discovered that need to be solved. The most important of these is that the plans they have set cannot be quickly approved by the competent departments, which affects the specific conduct of business. Another problem is that some cadres of the specialized companies, due to being in a decentralized operation for a long time, feel unfamiliar, strained, or do not fully understand the general spirit when carrying out specific work in the new transformation. They hope that the leading departments will give them more specific help.

### 贸易金库建立一月  京国营各专业公司缴库现金六百余亿

　　贸易金库建立一月
    京国营各专业公司缴库现金六百余亿
    【本报讯】记者近宇报道：贸易金库北京分库在京建立后，北京粮食、花纱布、百货、煤铁、油脂、盐业、蛋品、猪鬃、皮毛、土产等十个专业分、支公司在三月份中解缴入库现金总计六百六十二亿余元。各专业公司中，除百货公司超过百亿销货额外，粮食、花纱布等公司均完成预定货币回笼数字半数以上。由于各专业公司大力推销货物，回笼了相当数量的货币；同时，由于现金入库，停止了分散的个别收购工作，克服了把现金投入市场的盲目性。这就直接和间接地起了稳定物价的作用。
    这一制度的施行，使各该公司的业务经营上也有了新的改进：（一）初步增加了各专业公司经营的计划性。以往各该公司的业务计划多是根据本单位情况订定的，不仅伸缩性很大，同时也不照顾全面。这次所定计划则一定要根据总的方针精打细算。有若干公司因为计划不够切实曾反复修订几次。花纱布等公司为订定计划曾专门举行会议缜密研究。有些干部感到今天的计划太难定了。他们说：过去的计划既容易定，又不会碰到批驳，今天可不行了！但多数干部在一个多月的实践中，已认识到：订定精确实际的财务、业务计划，是增强计划性的第一步。（二）各专业公司的业务经营的方式方法也大加转变。因为业务不更加开展，回笼货币的任务就无法完成。在三月份，花纱布、煤铁等公司抽出了业务人员加强农村推销工作。百货、粮食等公司增添了分、支门市部。若干公司为多销货而延长营业时间和尽量简化购买、交款等手续。专业公司业务干部长期存在的“有货不愁卖”的思想，开始有了转变。（三）若干专业公司自经营方针转变之后，开始切实做到撙节营业费用以减少开支。如花纱布公司利用废料（铁腰子、麻绳、包布等）包装原棉或色布，百货公司在开设分、支机构时，减少了大量的开办费用等。
    现金入库制度实行之后，相继发现一些亟需解决的问题。其中最主要的是他们订定的计划不能很快地得到主管部门的核准，因而影响了业务的具体进行。另一问题是各专业公司的若干干部，由于长期处于分散经营情况下，在新的转变中进行具体工作时感到生疏、吃力或对总的精神领会不够。他们希望领导部门对他们多给予具体的帮助。
