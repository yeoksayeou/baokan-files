Shijiazhuang Specialized Companies Vigorously Promote Sales
Recapturing 35.6 Billion Currency Units
Coal, Iron, and Egg Products Companies Exceed Purchase and Sales Targets
[This newspaper's dispatch] This newspaper’s special correspondent Xu Dake reports: Since March, Shijiazhuang City’s coal and iron, grain, cotton yarn, general merchandise, and salt specialized branches and retail companies have been actively promoting the sale of goods to supply the needs of urban and rural people, recapturing 35.6 billion currency units for the entire month. Among the companies, the coal and iron company and the egg products company performed best. The coal and iron company’s sales of coal exceeded the original target by 13 percent, and iron goods exceeded it by 20 percent. The egg products company overfulfilled its egg purchasing task by 111 percent.

Overcoming Conservative Thinking, Exhausting All Means to Promote Sales

The main reasons for the success of these two companies are: first, they corrected the conservative thinking of "being reluctant to sell things" and "not actively thinking of ways to sell things" and the tendency towards empiricism, which greatly changed their business operation methods. Most cadres went out to promote sales, changing the past practice of sitting behind counters in a few cities and waiting for buyers. At the same time, they proactively dropped off coal cars along the railway lines, established relationships with cooperatives and various parties, ran to various towns and villages to set up stalls for sales, established sales networks, simplified procedures, expanded the scope of direct sales, and reduced intermediate exploitation. Second, they unified prices, adopted a strategy of small profits and quick turnover, and closely monitored the situation. In the past, due to inconsistent coal prices, private merchants had many loopholes to exploit. After adjustments, the price differences of coal in various regions have become more reasonable. For example, the price of large coal in Shijiazhuang City has dropped from 300,000 to 270,000 per ton. Last winter, coal prices in some areas often differed by one or two times, but now it has been reduced to 10-20%. At the same time, they massively sold off existing stocks, reducing the phenomenon of regular coal reserves of 40,000-50,000 tons to more than 20,000 tons; implementing small profits and quick turnover, which made the excessively high coal prices of private merchants drop rapidly.

Closely Cooperating with Relevant Departments, Expanding the Market for Goods Sales

Second, they closely cooperated with various departments and earnestly fulfilled contracts. For example, after signing a transportation contract with the Railway Bureau, they received full assistance from the Railway Bureau, allowing for flexible allocation. Combining with cooperatives greatly expanded the sales market and vigorously developed retail work. This time, the company had more than 20 official stalls and set up groups along the station lines for both retail and wholesale, overcoming the past operating method of only focusing on wholesale and neglecting retail.

Insufficiently Active Business Operations, Difficulty in Completing Sales Targets

In addition to the coal and iron and egg products companies, the grain company only completed 96.4 percent of its target, the general merchandise company completed 85.7 percent, the cotton yarn company completed 58 percent, the oil company completed 63 percent, the retail company completed 41.6 percent, and the salt company completed 25.2 percent. All failed to meet their targets. The main reason is that the overall cadres' reversal of old operating ideas was not enough, the tasks were not strictly defined, and the spirit of actively finding all possible ways to promote sales was not implemented. In addition, the past sales organizations were weak, resulting in the failure of industrial products to be massively distributed to the countryside, limiting operations to a few points, which led to the failure to complete the recovery task, which in turn affected the completion of the acquisition task. For example, if cloth cannot be sold, cotton cannot be sufficiently acquired. Secondly, there was a lack of thorough planning and inflexible allocation. The general merchandise company's goods were not transported in time in March, resulting in no goods to sell, hot items not arriving, and unpopular items piling up, forming a contradiction between inbound and outbound goods. Furthermore, the plan was not revised in a timely manner according to the actual situation. The Trade Treasury was not established until March 11, after Deputy Minister Yao of the Trade Department personally arrived in Shijiazhuang to convey the message. Therefore, the actual date of vigorous promotion only started in mid-March, and one-third of the whole month had already passed. The plan was originally made in February, but after the situation changed greatly in March, it was not revised in time, resulting in a large discrepancy.

New Difficulties Should Be Fully Estimated, Old Shortcomings Should Be Vigorously Overcome

Based on the above experience, judging from the completion of tasks by the coal and iron and salt companies, the main reason for the failure to complete the tasks is not the low purchasing power or the lack of currency, but that not enough effort has been made to actively find ways to open up sales channels. In addition, due to the tightening of credit and the shortage of bargaining chips, farmers directly exchange grain. Sales in larger markets are approaching saturation. For example, daily coal sales used to be 4,000 tons, but now they have been reduced to 2,000 tons. Of the 14,560 tons of coal stored in Shijiazhuang City on March 16, public and private jointly accounted for 14,032 tons, and state-owned only accounted for 528 tons, indicating that there is too much inventory in the market. Massively continuing sales in the short term will encounter new difficulties. For example, due to the different speeds and magnitudes of price drops in various places, some abnormal phenomena have occurred, such as the price of some goods in the selling area being lower than the price in the producing area, or the difference between the two places being negligible, which is not enough to cover the freight; the price of some finished goods being lower than the price of raw materials and semi-finished products, or the difference being negligible, which is not enough to cover the production cost. Although these phenomena are difficult to avoid immediately in the process of bringing the national economy into order, they should be fully estimated. Therefore, in addition to relying on cooperatives for sales, actively developing retail business, grasping the situation at any time, and summarizing experiences and lessons in a timely manner, cautious work has become the most important task for the future. For example, based on various situations in March, the retail company decided in April to add five retail stores without adding cadres. State-owned companies also jointly set up stalls in Zhengding and Hongzidian, strengthen mobile teams, and seize the temple fairs to promote sales. In the future, we should correct the phenomena of failure to unify thinking, mutual competition in sales between state-owned, public-owned, cooperative, and institutional production, or price-cutting competition by a few units, which offset the strength of state-owned enterprises and accelerated the gradual decline in market prices. We should appropriately centralize the transaction of grain and cloth, so as to further manage the larger transaction households of both public and private sectors, and unify the public-owned grain and cloth prices. In market transactions, the sales method of "state first, then public" should be implemented. In addition, some units do not act according to the plan, which destroys the state-owned plan. For example, the general merchandise company does not allocate materials according to the plan; the funds of oil, pig bristle and other companies cannot be allocated on schedule; some require the grain company to increase the supply from 30 catties to 40 catties per person per month, but after the grain company includes it in the March plan, they themselves do not want it or want less, without notifying the grain company to revise the plan in advance, and they do not implement it according to the plan. This style has played a destructive role in the entire plan, and it should be corrected immediately in the future. Local party and government also need to check and supervise at any time and help greatly to ensure the completion of the task. If the various companies that have not completed the task could have conducted strict and timely inspections in the past, the situation of the plan failing would not have been so serious. At the same time, in the actual work of implementing the plan, model cadres and irresponsible cadres should be rewarded and punished in a timely manner to encourage all staff to turn the plan into everyone's plan, promote the spirit of creating new methods to overcome difficulties in the new situation, and overcome the laissez-faire attitude towards the plan and the liberal attitude towards completing the task, so as to ensure the completion and exceeding of the task.

### 石市各专业公司大力推销  回笼货币三百五十六亿  煤铁蛋品两公司超额完成购销任务

　　石市各专业公司大力推销
    回笼货币三百五十六亿
    煤铁蛋品两公司超额完成购销任务
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员徐大可报道：石家庄市煤铁、粮食、花纱布、百货、盐业等专业分公司与零售公司，自三月份起，积极推销货物，供应城乡人民需要，全月回笼货币三百五十六亿元。各公司中以煤铁公司与蛋品公司成绩最好，煤铁公司推销煤超过原任务百分之十三，铁货超过百分之二十；蛋品公司超额完成百分之一百十一的收蛋任务。
    克服保守思想  想尽办法推销
    该两个公司获得成绩的主要原因：首先是纠正了“舍不得卖东西”以及“不积极想法卖东西”的保守思想与经验主义倾向，使业务经营方法有了很大的改变。大部分干部出去推销，改变了过去只限在几个城市中，坐在柜台里等买主的作风；同时主动的在沿铁路线，甩下煤车，向合作社及各方面建立关系，跑到各乡镇设摊推销，建立销售网，并简化手续，扩张了直接销售范围，减少了中间剥削。其次是统一价格，薄利广销，缜密地掌握情况。过去因煤价不统一，给予私商不少空子；经调整后已使各地煤价差额趋于合理。如石市大煤每吨由三十万降至二十七万；去冬有些地区煤价经常相差一、两倍，目前已缩小为一、两成。同时大量出脱存货，使过去经常存煤四、五万吨的现象减至两万多吨；贯彻薄利多销，使私商过高的煤价迅速下降。
    密切联系有关部门  扩大货物销售市场
    第二、密切与各部门配合，认真履行合同。如与铁路局订立运输合同后，得到铁路局全力协助，调拨灵活。与合作社结合，大大的扩展了销售市场，并用力展开了零售工作。这次该公司所属正式摊子即达二十余个，在沿站线设有小组，零整批发，克服过去只注重批发、忽视零售的经营方式。
    业务经营不够主动  推销任务即难完成
    除了煤铁、蛋品两公司外，粮食公司仅完成任务百分之九十六点四，百货公司完成百分之八十五点七，花纱布公司完成百分之五十八，油脂公司完成百分之六十三，零售公司完成百分之四十一点六，盐业公司完成百分之二十五点二。均未完成任务。其原因主要是全体干部扭转旧经营思想不够，任务确定也不严格，没有贯彻想尽一切办法积极设法推销的精神。加以过去推销机构薄弱，造成工业品未能大量下乡，使经营局限在几个点上，以致回笼任务不能完成，反过来影响收购任务亦不能完成。如布销不出，棉花便收不足。其次是缺乏周密计划，调拨不灵。百货公司三月份货物调运不及时，以致有销无货，热货不来，背货拥到，形成进销矛盾。且未根据实际情况及时修正计划，贸易金库直到上旬末贸易部姚副部长亲到石家庄传达后，始于三月十一日建立。故大力推销实际日是从中旬才开始的，全月时间已过去三分之一。计划原来是二月订的，进入三月情况大变后，并未能及时修正，以致出入悬殊。
    新困难应充分估计  旧缺点应大力克服
    根据以上经验，从煤铁和盐业两公司完成任务的情况看来，任务不能完成的主要原因，并非是购买力低，也不是票子不足，而是积极想办法打开销路做得不够。另外由于银根抽紧，筹码短少，农民直接以粮交换。较大市场销售接近饱和状态。如燃煤过去日销四千吨，现减至二千吨。石市三月十六日全市存煤一万四千五百六十吨中，公私共占一四、○三二吨，国营仅占五二八吨，说明市场滞货过多，今后短期内大量续销，当会碰到新的困难。如由于各地各种物价跌落的速度和幅度各不相同，产生的若干不正常的现象，如有些货物销地价格反而低于产地，或者两地相差无几，以致不够运费，有些货物成品比价反而较原料与半制品的比价为低，或者相差无几，以致不够生产成本等等现象，虽然是在开始把全国经济纳入正轨的进程中，一些难于立即避免的现象，但要充分的估计到。因此，除依靠合作社推销外，积极开展零售业务，随时掌握情况，及时总结经验教训，谨慎的工作成为今后头等重要的工作任务。如零售公司根据三月份各种情况决定四月份在不添干部原则下，增设五个零售店。国营公司并在正定、洪子店联合设摊，加强流动小组，抓紧庙会推销。对未能统一思想，国、公营、合作社、机关生产等相互竞销或少数单位削价竞售，抵销了公营力量，加速市价步步滑跌的现象，今后应加纠正，适当集中成交粮食、纱布，达到进一步管理公私较大成交户，并统一公营粮布价格，在市场交易上，执行先国后公的出售办法。又部分单位不按计划办事，破坏了国营计划，如百货公司不按计划调拨物资；油脂猪鬃等公司款项不能按期拨到；有的要求粮食公司供应量由每人每月三十斤增到四十斤，待粮食公司编入三月份计划后，自己却又不要或少要，事先既不通知粮食公司修正计划，自己又不按计划执行。这种作风，对整个计划起了破坏作用，今后亦应即时纠正，地方党政亦须随时检查督促与大力帮助，保证任务的完成。凡未完成任务的各公司过去如能严格及时检查，则计划落空的情况决不致那样严重。同时，在执行计划的实际工作中，对模范的干部与不负责任的干部，应及时分别奖惩，以鼓舞起全体工作人员把计划变成大家的计划，发扬在新情况下创造新办法克服困难的精神，克服对计划的自流态度与对完成任务的自由主义态度，以保证完成并超过任务。
