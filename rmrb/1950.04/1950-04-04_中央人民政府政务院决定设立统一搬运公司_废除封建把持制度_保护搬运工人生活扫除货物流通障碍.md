Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Central People's Government Administrative Council accepted the suggestion from the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union regarding the establishment of a unified handling company and the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions, and made the following decision (adopted at the 26th Administrative Meeting of the Administrative Council on March 31, 1950):

The Administrative Council, after reviewing the suggestion from the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union to the Central People's Government regarding the establishment of a handling company and the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions, believes that the existing situations of foremen, headmen, and gang leaders monopolizing docks, extorting merchants, and cruelly exploiting workers in handling services in various regions are indeed the most prominent feudal remnants in various cities. Appropriate measures should be taken to abolish them in order to protect the livelihoods of handling workers, remove obstacles to the circulation of goods, and facilitate the development of production and the prosperity of the economy. The suggestion from the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union on this issue is justified and reasonable, and the proposed interim handling measures are also practical and feasible. Therefore, the following decisions are made:

(1) Accept the suggestion from the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union regarding the establishment of a handling company and the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions, and approve the interim handling measures for abolishing the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions, which will be promulgated and implemented immediately.

(2) To eliminate the feudal and tyrannical forces in the handling industry, it is necessary to rely on the awareness and organization of handling workers. Therefore, when carrying out this work, the people's governments in various regions should first help handling workers to organize and establish and consolidate the organization of the handling workers' union, so as to rely on the support and endorsement of the handling workers' union to establish a unified handling company.

(3) The people's governments of relevant cities should appoint capable cadres as managers and deputy managers of the handling company, and designate representatives from public security organs, trade departments, and representatives elected by the handling workers' union to form the management committee of the handling company, with the manager as the chairman and one of the representatives of the handling workers' union as the vice-chairman.

(4) After receiving this decision, the people's governments of relevant cities should immediately convene relevant agencies and organizations to discuss the methods for implementing this decision, adopt a steady approach, and report to the people's government of the Greater Administrative Region (or Military and Political Committee) for approval before implementation. The five provinces and two cities in North China should report to this Council for approval before implementation. The implementation situation in various regions should be reported to this Council at any time.

The First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union
Suggestion to the Central People's Government Regarding the Establishment of a Handling Company and the Abolition of the Feudal Monopoly System in Handling Services in Various Regions

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The suggestion from the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union to the Central People's Government regarding the establishment of a handling company and the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions (adopted by the National Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union on February 6, 1950) (approved by the 24th Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on March 9, 1950), is as follows:

In the past, dock loading and unloading operations in various parts of China have been ruled and monopolized by feudal forces such as foremen, headmen, gang leaders, and coolie bosses. These feudal leaders occupy the docks, and their positions are inherited from generation to generation, creating a state of feudal separatism in the cities. They implement cruel feudal exploitation and enslavement of handling workers, taking most of the handling workers' labor income (in some cases, more than 80%) for themselves, and often force workers to perform unpaid compulsory labor. Some even set up private courts, using torture to beat workers, even raping workers' wives and daughters, and driving people to death. They forcibly handle goods for merchants and customers, arbitrarily extorting and blackmailing them, doing whatever they want, and creating various pretexts to collect fees, sometimes as many as fourteen or fifteen kinds, thus forming a highly unreasonable freight rate phenomenon. For example, the cost of unloading goods from a ship to a warehouse and then to a merchant's store in Hankou is almost equivalent to the freight cost from Shanghai to Hankou. In order to compete for dock territory, these feudal leaders not only formed gangs and created their own tyrannical forces, often instigating workers to fight each other, resulting in tragic deaths, but also bribing officials, colluding with special agents and bandits, and protecting their criminal acts. During the Kuomintang's rule, this became even more intensified. The heads of large coolie gangs in various cities jumped to become important figures in the Kuomintang party-state, national representatives, and openly committed evil without any scruples. The existence of these feudal forces not only seriously affects the exchange of materials and the development of industry and commerce, not only plunges the lives of workers into a deep abyss of suffering, but also hinders urban security and the implementation of democratic politics. Therefore, the First Congress of the Chinese Handling Workers' Union unanimously resolved to request the Central People's Government to promulgate laws and decrees, and for the people's governments in various regions to establish unified handling companies, abolish the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various cities, in order to protect the lives of handling workers, remove obstacles to the smooth flow of goods, and facilitate the development of production and the prosperity of the economy. To this end, the Congress has specially drafted interim handling measures for abolishing the feudal monopoly system in handling services in various regions, and submitted them to the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government for review, promulgation and implementation.

The 25th Administrative Meeting of the Administrative Council Passes Interim Handling Measures for Abolishing the Feudal Monopoly System in Handling Services in Various Regions

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The full text of the Interim Handling Measures for Abolishing the Feudal Monopoly System in Handling Services in Various Regions (adopted at the 25th Administrative Meeting of the Administrative Council on March 24, 1950) is as follows:

    中国搬运工会第一届代表大会关于设立搬运公司、废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度向中央人民政府的建议，经本院审查后，认为各地搬运事业中存在的包工头、把头、脚行头等把持码头、勒索商旅、并对工人实行残酷剥削的情形，实为各地城市中最显著的封建残余制度，应当采取适当办法予以废除，以保护搬运工人生活，扫除货物流通的障碍，并便利发展生产繁荣经济的事业。中国搬运工会第一届代表大会关于本问题的建议是正当的、合理的，所拟暂行处理办法，亦是切实可行的。因此特决定如下：

    中国搬运工会第一届代表大会
    关于设立搬运公司废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度向中央人民政府的建议
    【新华社三日讯】中国搬运工会第一届代表大会关于设立搬运公司废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度向中央人民政府的建议（一九五○年二月六日中国搬运工会全国代表大会通过）（一九五○年三月九日中华全国总工会第二十四次常务委员会批准），全文如下：
    中国各地的码头起卸搬运事业，历来为包工头、把头、帮头、脚行头等封建势力所统治把持。这些封建头子霸占码头，子孙世袭，造成城市中封建割据状况，对搬运工人实行残酷的封建剥削和奴役，将搬运工人劳动收入的大部分（有的达到百分之八十以上）占为己有，并经常强迫工人作无报酬的义务劳役，有的甚至家设法堂，私刑拷打工人，甚至强奸工人妻女，逼死人命。对于客商货物，则强行搬运，任意敲诈勒索，为所欲为，巧立名目，勒收费用，竟至十四、五种之多，因而形成运价极不合理的现象。如汉口客商货物，由船舱卸入仓库，到客商的店铺，几等于上海运至汉口的运费。这班封建头子，为了争夺码头地盘，不仅结合帮口，造成自己的恶霸势力，常常挑唆工人互相殴斗，发生人命惨剧，而且贿赂官府，勾结特务匪徒，庇护自己的罪恶行为。到了国民党统治时代，更变本加厉，各城市中大脚行头子一跃而为国民党的党国要人、国大代表，更是公然作恶，毫无忌惮。这种封建势力的存在，不仅严重的影响到物资交流和工商业的发展，不仅使工人的生活陷入痛苦的深渊，而且妨碍城市治安与民主政治的设施。因此中国搬运工会第一届代表大会，一致决议，请求中央人民政府颁布法令，由各地人民政府设立统一的搬运公司，废除各城市搬运事业中的封建把持制度，以保护搬运工人的生活，扫除货物畅通的障碍，并便利发展生产、繁荣经济的事业。为此代表大会特拟定关于废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度暂行处理办法草案，送请中央人民政府政务院审核颁布施行。
