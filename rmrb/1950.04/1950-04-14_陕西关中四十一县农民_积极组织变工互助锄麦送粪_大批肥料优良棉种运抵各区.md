Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th: Farmers in 41 counties in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, are actively organizing labor exchange and mutual aid to weed wheat and deliver manure in order to complete this year's grain production increase task. The aforementioned 41 counties are the main wheat and cotton producing areas in the Northwest. Currently, there are 22,246,800 mu of wheat land in the entire area, most of which has been weeded once, and some wheat land has been top-dressed with fertilizer. During the weeding process, cadres in various places have gone to the countryside to help farmers work. Some counties have also universally established labor exchange and mutual aid groups through farmer representative meetings to mobilize farmers to actively weed wheat and deliver manure. For example, the southeast district of Pingmin County organized 37 labor exchange groups, which weeded more than 3,400 mu of wheat fields in the entire district and delivered more than 300 carts of manure within seven days. Another example is Chang'an County, which organized a total of 2,607 labor exchange groups, and has now weeded 698,800 mu of wheat land. In Zhanghong District, Gouyi County, 28 labor exchange groups launched a weeding competition, weeding the entire township's 2,600 mu of wheat land twice before Qingming Festival and delivering 300 carts of manure.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, in addition to focusing on spring weeding, is also carrying out the following related tasks: First, expanding cotton field area, increasing water conservancy irrigation, rewarding farmers for planting cotton, promoting intensive cultivation, and improving varieties. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government has now transported 2,000 tons of chemical fertilizer and 25,680 dan of high-quality cotton seeds to cotton-producing areas and distributed them to farmers. Secondly, mobilizing laborers to actively repair the Jinghui Canal and Luohui Canal, two major water conservancy projects, in order to expand the area under water conservancy irrigation, and mobilizing more than 200,000 laborers in flood-stricken areas such as Huayin County to carry out drainage and dam repair. Huayin County has now repaired 13 drainage gates, and Chang'an County has repaired 11 river embankments.

　　陕西关中四十一县农民
    积极组织变工互助锄麦送粪
    大批肥料优良棉种运抵各区
    【新华社西安十二日电】陕西关中四十一县农民，为完成今年粮食增产任务，正积极组织变工互助进行锄麦送粪。上述四十一县是西北主要的麦棉产区，现全区二千二百二十四万六千八百余亩麦地，其中绝大部分已锄完一次草，有些麦地已施上追肥。在锄麦中，各地干部都纷纷下乡帮助农民工作。有的县并通过农民代表会普遍地建立变工互助发动农民积极进行锄麦送粪。如平民县东南区即组织了三十七个变工组，七天内就锄完了全区三千四百余亩麦田，还送上三百余车粪。又如长安县全县共组织起二千六百零七个变工组，现已锄完麦地六十九万八千八百余亩。枸邑县张洪区二乡二十八个变工组，开展锄草竞赛，在清明前即把全乡二千六百亩麦地锄了两次，并送完三百车粪。
    为了保证今年粮棉增产任务的完成，陕西省人民政府除以春季锄麦为中心任务外，并进行下列几项有关的工作：首先是扩大棉田面积，增加水利灌溉，奖励农民植棉，提倡精耕细作，改良品种。陕西省人民政府现已将两千吨化学肥料和二万五千六百八十担优良棉种运抵各产棉区，发放给农民。其次，动员民工积极整修泾惠渠和洛惠渠两大水利工程，以扩大水利灌溉面积，并在华阴等县水灾区动员二十余万民工进行排水修坝。现华阴县已修好排水闸十三个，长安县已修好河堤十一处。
