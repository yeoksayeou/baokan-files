Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 14th: The spring repair projects for water conservancy and irrigation in various counties of western and northern Sichuan have been completed, and some canals have already begun releasing water ahead of schedule. The Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Guanxian County, the largest water conservancy project in Southwest China, has begun releasing water on the 2nd of this month after active repairs by the local military and civilians. The Western Sichuan People's Government allocated 20,000 shi of grain to mobilize farmers to rush to repair the canal. The People's Governments of the counties near the weir also seized the leadership of the water conservancy project, lending grain and loans, and actively rushing to repair it. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the canal repair dug more than 2,000 shi fang of river in just four days (digging one zhang long, one zhang wide, and one chi thick is one shi fang), which doubled the efficiency of migrant workers digging rivers in previous years, thus enabling the project to be completed ahead of schedule. The weir used more than 200,000 workers and more than 1,100 tons of bamboo and wood. After the completion of this project, 3.5 million mu of fertile land in the Chengdu Plain of western Sichuan will be fully irrigated. Due to the People's Government's improvement of the grain distribution system in the Silianshan Weir renovation project in Suining County, the elimination of the past exploitation by foremen, and the elimination of the old engineering personnel's corrupt practices, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was extremely high, which enabled the weir renovation project to be completed ahead of schedule, and saved 237 shi of grain more than the budget. The weir is 60 li long, irrigates more than 27,000 mu of farmland, and supplies power to the entire city of Suining. The Peng County People's Government mobilized the masses to rush to repair the Jiangyan Weir project in January. Now six rivers, including the Yazi River, have been released to irrigate farmland in seven counties, including Peng County and Xinfan. In addition, Mianzhu County completed the Guan, Peng, and Song three major weirs irrigating 120,000 mu of farmland in seven days, and Mianyang County completed nine major canals including Huize and Longxi, so that more than 54,000 mu of fertile land was spared from drought.
    Due to the rapid completion of water weirs in various places, coupled with the bumper wheat harvest this spring, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been greatly improved. At present, spring plowing and production have generally begun in various places.

　　川西、川北各县水利灌溉春修竣工
    西南最大水利工程灌县都江堰开始放水
    【新华社重庆十四日电】川西、川北各县水利灌溉春修工程业已竣工，部分渠道已经提前放水。西南最大水利工程的灌县都江堰，经当地军民积极抢修，已于本月二日开始放水。川西人民政府为发动农民抢修该渠，曾拨发粮食两万市石，该堰附近各县人民政府亦抓紧对水利工程的领导，贷粮贷款，积极赶修。参加修渠的人民解放军某部，仅四天内即挖河二千余市方（挖一丈长、一丈宽、一尺厚为一市方），比往年民工挖河效率提高一倍，因此使工程提前完成。该堰共用工二十多万，竹木料一千一百余吨。这一工程完成后，川西成都平原三百五十万亩良田即可获充分灌溉。遂宁县四联堰整修工程，由于人民政府改进了发粮制度，取缔过去工头的中间剥削，并扫除了旧工程人员的贪污中饱恶习，工人劳动热情极高，使该堰整修工程提前完成，并比预算节省粮二百三十七石。该堰长达六十里，灌溉农田二万七千余亩，并供给遂宁全城发电动力。彭县人民政府于一月间发动群众抢修湔江堰工程，现已有鸭子河等六道河放水，使彭县、新繁等七县农田获得灌溉。此外，绵竹县七天内完成灌溉十二万亩农田的官、堋、宋三大堰，绵阳县完成了惠泽、龙西等九道大渠，使五万四千余亩良田免遭干旱。
    由于各地水堰迅速竣工，加之今春小麦丰收，农民生产情绪大大提高。现各地已普遍开始进行春耕生产。
