　　New Contributions from Workers of the Beijing Public Bus Company:
    Successful Conversion of Coal-Fired Buses
    Convenient to Use, Saves Fuel, No Damage to Machinery. Eighteen buses can be put into operation throughout the city on "May Day".
    [This newspaper's report] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: The Beijing Public Bus Company's repair shop has successfully converted buses to run on coal instead of gasoline, charcoal, and wood, overcoming the shortcomings of previous coal-fired buses. The new type of coal-fired bus saves more than twice as much fuel cost as charcoal and wood-fired buses, which plays a significant role in reducing the cost of public transportation. The factory has now begun the conversion process, and eighteen coal-fired buses will be in operation on "May Day".
    Although coal-fired buses have been around for a long time, they have not been popularized due to many shortcomings. For example, after the coal is burned, it forms cinders, which hinder the fire's heat; the sulfur contained in the coal turns into sulfur trioxide, which corrodes cylinders, engines, and other parts; and if the bus is parked for a little while, the temperature drops, and a layer of white ash forms on the surface of the coal, making it difficult to burn, etc. The workers and technicians of the Beijing Public Bus Repair Shop, in response to these shortcomings of coal-fired buses, have redesigned a new type of coal-fired furnace after many studies and improvements: a movable bottom is set under the furnace. When the coal burns and forms cinders, the movable bottom can be slowly lowered to separate the cinders from the fire, and the unburned coal in the upper layer of the furnace also falls down to replenish the fire, so that the fire always maintains a certain temperature. It is also not necessary to "shut down the fire" when moving the movable bottom. Sulfur is contained in the coal (generally coal contains about 5%, a type of coal produced in Yangquan contains 0.4%), which is not easy to remove, but sulfur trioxide is easily soluble in water and can be filtered out with water. In addition, a small electric blower is installed in the car to increase the gasification rate in the furnace, and a "gas oversupply device" is installed next to the engine, which uses the engine's rotation to rock the wind and inject it into the coal furnace to help speed up the gasification rate, so as to maintain a certain temperature in the furnace when driving slowly or parking for a long time.
    After such a conversion, it can run continuously for sixteen hours without having to remove the cinders. After the sulfide is filtered out, it has reached a level that will not corrode the machinery. The temperature inside the furnace does not drop even when driving slowly, and when igniting and starting, because of the blower's wind, it only takes twelve minutes and does not require charcoal or wood to ignite.
    General wood-fired buses generate tar and wood vinegar after the wood is burned, which easily corrodes the cylinders and engines; charcoal-fired buses have a lot of ash, which also damages the machinery. The new type of coal-fired bus not only does not have these shortcomings, but also has no less power than a charcoal-fired bus. If higher quality coal is burned, the driving performance of the coal-fired bus can be further increased. The Beijing Public Bus Company has now sent people to the Yangquan Coal Mine to investigate the quality of the coal.
    Coal is cheaper than charcoal and wood, and coal-fired buses can greatly save on fuel costs compared to charcoal-fired buses. Currently, the cost of fuel for buses running in the city is equivalent to one jin of millet per kilometer for charcoal, 0.8 jin of millet for wood, and only 0.4 jin of millet for coal. The public buses in Beijing run an average of 3,000 kilometers per month (up to more than 5,000 kilometers at most). In terms of fuel costs alone, each coal-fired bus can save 1,800 jin of millet per month compared to a charcoal-fired bus.
    It is very easy to convert ordinary wood-fired or charcoal-fired buses into new coal-fired buses; it is also not difficult to install a coal-fired furnace in ordinary gasoline cars. The conversion cost of each car is only equivalent to the fuel cost saved in half a month.

    改装石炭汽车成功     
    使用方便，节省燃料，对机件无损害。“五一”节全市可出驶十八辆
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：北京公共汽车公司修理厂改装石炭汽车，用煤作燃料代替汽油、木炭、木柴，克服过去一般石炭车的缺点，现已试验成功。新式石炭车较木炭、木柴车节省燃料费在一倍以上，对公共汽车减低成本起极大作用。现该厂已着手改装，在“五一”劳动节可出石炭汽车十八辆。
    石炭汽车虽发明已久，但因存在着许多缺点，迄未普及。如煤经过燃烧后结成焦碴，妨碍火带之火力；煤内所含之硫磺变成三氧化硫侵蚀汽缸、引擎等机件；以及停车时间稍久，温度降低，煤的表面结一层白灰，不易燃烧等等。京公共汽车修理厂工人及技术人员针对石炭车这些缺点，经过多次研究改进，设计一新式石炭炉：炉下设一活底，煤燃烧结成焦碴时，可将活底徐徐降低，使焦碴脱离火带，而炉内上层未燃之煤亦随之下降补进，使火带经常保持一定的热度。在移动活底时又不必“歇火”。煤内含有硫磺（一般煤约含百分之五，阳泉矿产一种煤含千分之四）不易去掉，但三氧化硫易溶于水，可以用水滤清。此外又在车内按装一小型电动鼓风机，增加炉内气化率，另在引擎旁装置“气体过供器”，利用引擎的转动，摇风打入石炭炉，帮助加快气化速度，以在开慢车或停车久时维持炉内一定温度。
    经过这样改装以后，可连续行驶十六个小时不必掏焦碴。硫化物经滤清后、已达到不致侵蚀机件的程度。走慢车时炉内温度也不致降低，且在点火发动时，因有鼓风机的吹风，仅需十二分钟，且不需要木炭、木柴引火。
    一般木柴汽车，木柴燃烧后发生焦油及木醋酸，极易侵蚀汽缸及引擎；木炭汽车则灰多亦损害机件。新式的石炭汽车不仅没有这些缺点，发动力量也毫不低于木炭车，如再燃用质量好的煤，更可增加石炭车行驶效能。现京公共汽车公司已派人赴阳泉煤矿考察煤质。
    煤较木炭、木柴价格均低，石炭汽车较木炭汽车可大大节省燃料费。现市内行驶之汽车每行一公里燃用木炭费合一斤小米，燃用木柴费合○·八斤小米，燃用煤费仅合○·四斤小米，京市的公共汽车每辆每月平均跑三千公里（最多时跑五千余公里），仅燃料费一项，每辆石炭车较木炭车每月可节省一千八百斤小米。
    用一般的木炭车或木柴车改装成新式石炭车非常容易；一般汽油车装石炭炉亦不难，每辆车的改装费仅当跑半个月节省下的燃料费。
