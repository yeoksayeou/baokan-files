　　Tangshan Railway Factory External Wiring Team
    Continuously Exceeds Targets
    Automatically Collects Materials Saving Over 60,000 Catties of Rice
    [Our Dispatch] The workers of the Tangshan Railway Factory's external wiring team, displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm, have repeatedly completed and exceeded their work targets, and have consecutively received three "Red Flag" awards; they have also automatically collected materials, saving the equivalent of over 67,000 catties of rice. In October of last year, five workers of this team, Bian Yaodong, Wang Anzhai, Zhao Junqi, Wang Jianzhong, and Liu Chunzhi, used an iron ladder, braving black smoke, to repair the lightning rod line on the factory's No. 1 boiler room's 15-zhang high chimney, completing in two hours a project that was originally planned to take two months to complete with scaffolding. Since then, they have been awarded the glorious title of "Five Warriors." This glorious achievement has been adapted into a play by literary and artistic workers. This team of thirteen, under the leadership and active example of team leader Bian Yaodong, completed in February of this year in 217 workdays a task that the factory estimated would require 335 workdays, exceeding the original plan by more than 35 percent. In March, the factory launched a record-breaking campaign. The team completed the originally stipulated 20-day task in 14 days, and also completed an additional 909 work-hours of work outside the plan. This was due to the team's increased work efficiency. Comparing the latter half of March with the previous period, the efficiency of replacing 15 KVA transformers increased by 88.3 percent; the efficiency of modifying light lines increased by 226.8 percent; the efficiency of modifying DC power lines and power switches increased by 91.5 percent; the efficiency of modifying AC power lines and adding power switches increased by 122.2 percent; and the efficiency of installing electric lights increased by 233 percent. In addition, to save expenses and cherish materials, the team workers automatically dismantled more than six tons of discarded wires (all usable) from electric poles, worth over 67,000 catties of rice, and collected more than 400 magnetic heads. Recently, they also automatically modified high-voltage lines. This positive and responsible work attitude fully demonstrates the working class's sense of responsibility as masters of their country and their enthusiasm for cherishing national property.

　　唐山铁路工厂外线组
    连续超额完成任务
    自动收集器材节米六万余斤
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂外线组工友，发挥高度劳动热情，屡次完成并超过工作任务，连续获得三次“红旗”奖励；并自动收集器材，可节省米六万七千余斤。去年十月间，该组工友边耀东、王安宅、赵俊岐、王建忠、刘春芝等五人曾利用铁梯，冒着黑烟，抢修该厂第一号锅炉房高达十五丈烟筒的避雷针线路，在两小时内完成了原计划搭架子修理需时二月的工程。从此，他们获得“五勇士”的光荣称号。这一光辉成绩，文艺工作者已编写为剧本。该组十三人在边耀东组长的领导和积极带头影响下，今年二月份以二百一十七个工，完成了厂方估计需三百三十五个工的任务，并超过原订计划的百分之三十五强。三月份该厂展开创纪录运动，该组在十四天中即完成了原规定二十天的任务，而且在计划外又完成了九百零九个工时的工作，这是由于该组工作效率更加提高的结果。以三月后半月与以前比较，换十五ＫＶＡ的变压器，提高效率百分之八十八·三；改灯线提高了百分之二二六·八；改直流动力线、插电门等工作提高效率百分之九一·五；改交流动力线加电门提高了百分之一二二·二；装电灯提高了百分之二三三等。此外，为节省开支、爱护器材，该组工友自动拆下电杆上废线（都能用）六吨多，值小米六万七千余斤；搜集磁头四百多个。最近他们又自动改装高压线，这种积极负责的工作态度，充分表现出工人阶级主人翁的劳动态度和爱护国家资财的热忱。
