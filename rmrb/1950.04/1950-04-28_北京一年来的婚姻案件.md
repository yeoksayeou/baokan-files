　　Marriage Cases in Beijing Over the Past Year
　　By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng
　　From the establishment of the Beijing Municipal People's Court on March 18 last year to March of this year, it has handled more than 1,000 marriage cases in civil matters (the former Peiping Local Court under the pseudo-regime handled only 159 marriage cases before 1948). Among them, divorce cases account for more than 90 percent, and two-thirds are filed by women, mostly young women aged 20 to 30. In criminal matters, more than 500 marriage cases have been handled, with cases of disrupting the family, such as bigamy or adultery, being the most numerous; followed by cases involving lawsuits due to unbearable abuse. This reflects that the people of Beijing after liberation, especially women who have suffered the deepest oppression, urgently demand freedom of marriage.
　　Before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the Beijing Municipal People's Court handled marriage cases according to the Provisional Marriage Regulations of the old liberated areas—the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region—based on the principle of independent and voluntary monogamy. In the past year, marriage problems in Beijing have generally fallen into the following categories:
　　Regarding the issue of one party insisting on divorce, the People's Court first examines whether the union of both parties was based on independence and voluntariness, then understands whether the party insisting on divorce has sufficient reasons and conditions, whether it conforms to the marriage policy of the People's Government, and whether there is still a possibility of maintaining the relationship between the two parties; whether this maintenance is beneficial to society and both parties. When a man or woman firmly requests a divorce, a judgment is rendered after mediation has failed. Those who firmly request divorce are mostly rural women in the suburbs of Beijing and urban petty bourgeois women. The People's Government firmly supports women who are oppressed and abused by feudal families to gain liberation, but gives strict education and criticism to those who take a frivolous and irresponsible attitude towards marriage issues. A rural woman named Li Lushi firmly demanded a divorce from her husband, Li Kun, due to abuse. Li Lushi was married to Li Kun through a arranged marriage by her parents when she was in her teens. The relationship between the two was not good after marriage, and Li Lushi suffered extreme abuse from her parents-in-law and her husband. Her father-in-law once forced her into adultery, but failed, and became angry and often beat and scolded her. Li Lushi, unable to bear the abuse, ran back to her parents' home, and after Beijing was liberated, she went to the People's Court to request a divorce. After several trials by the court, the facts were confirmed, so the man was given severe criticism and education, a divorce was granted, and the man was ordered to bear the woman's current living expenses.
　　Regarding the issue of bigamy. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, although the pseudo-Six Codes flaunted the articles of monogamy, the fact that men could have three wives and four concubines was still allowed. Most of these women became concubines due to natural disasters, man-made calamities, or being deceived by men; some were also willing to be concubines because they were dominated by backward hedonistic ideas that loved vanity and money. In the old society, they were subjected to all kinds of discrimination and completely lost their freedom in life. Some women were abandoned because their husbands favored their younger wives; others were jointly abused by their husbands and wives. In short, under the extremely unreasonable feudal marriage relationship, women suffered all kinds of spiritual and physical pain. Therefore, after the liberation of Beijing, many concubines, unable to bear this painful situation, recognized the People's Government's policy of freedom of marriage, and consciously requested divorce, while some original wives filed petitions requesting that their husbands be divorced from their concubines. The People's Court adheres to the principle of monogamy, breaks such unreasonable feudal marriage relationships, and judges them to be divorced. Those who committed bigamy before liberation are only given strict criticism and education and are not punished. As for bigamy incidents that occur after liberation, they must be subject to criminal punishment. For example, the daughter of a vegetable vendor, Li Futing, married Sun Hong, who was twenty-nine years older than her, when she was twenty years old. After marriage, she found that Sun Hong also had a wife and abused her very much, so she requested a divorce. The court granted the divorce.
　　As for women who are given to others as adopted daughters or child brides due to family poverty, the oppression and abuse they suffer are even more serious than others, and some are even forced into prostitution. In the cases handled by the People's Court in recent years, there are many such cases of people who cannot bear the persecution and come to the court to file charges. This was rarely dared to complain about in the old society; and the People's Government gives absolute support to such persecuted women, while the violent feudal forces are given the legal sanctions they deserve. Last year, a seventeen-year-old girl named Zhang Shumin asked the Municipal People's Court to terminate her adoptive relationship. When she was five years old, her biological father, Li Wenchun, adopted her to Zhang Wengui and his wife as an adopted daughter. The Zhang couple specialized in lending land for people to commit adultery and profited from it. In 1947, because Zhang Shumin was older, they wanted to force her into prostitution. Zhang Shumin refused. The Zhang couple's poisonous plan failed, and they became angry, so they often beat and scolded her. Finally, in September 1949, they forced Zhang Shumin to have intercourse with Meng Xiangmao, a businessman from an auto parts shop. The Zhang couple stated that the intercourse would last for half a month, and the price would be five bags of flour. Later, the Zhang couple continued to force Zhang Shumin to engage in prostitution. Zhang Shumin could not bear it any longer, so she sued the People's Court, requesting to terminate the adoptive relationship. The People's Court accepted Zhang Shumin's reasonable request and sentenced Zhang Wengui and his wife to five years in prison for their criminal behavior and made necessary compensation to Zhang Shumin.
　　Regarding the divorce of cadres, this also accounts for a considerable number of divorce cases, and most of them are filed by male cadres. According to investigations, this situation is mostly because they are dissatisfied with the marriages arranged by their parents in the past, or because there is a distance in their thinking and they cannot live together, so they request a divorce. When dealing with these issues, the People's Court mostly adopts persuasive mediation methods first, because both or one party is a revolutionary cadre, has a certain understanding of policies and laws, and has the obligation to help transform and promote the progress of the ideologically backward party. Divorce is only granted after mediation has failed. This is beneficial to both revolutionary work and the men and women involved. For example, Chai Zhengzhi of the People's Revolutionary University was married to Guo Shuxiu by his parents in 1940. After marriage, he felt pain because of the unfree marriage, so he left in 1942 and did not write home for six and a half years. Later, although he returned home once, he did not live with Guo Shuxiu. After marriage, the woman completely pinned her hopes on her husband and children. The husband firmly requested a divorce. She felt that it was "dishonorable" and expressed her firm disagreement. Even if her husband found another wife, she would be willing. After mediation failed, the facts proved that they could no longer continue their marriage relationship. Finally, the court granted them a divorce.
　　These unfortunate marriage cases are the evil consequences of the unreasonable marriage system in the old society. If they continue to be maintained reluctantly, it will inevitably cause greater pain to both parties. The new Marriage Law, based on the foundation of independent and voluntary monogamy, is designed to break this unreasonable phenomenon and open up the path to a happy and fulfilling family life.

　　北京一年来的婚姻案件
    本报记者  柏生
    从去年三月十八日京市人民法院成立，至今年三月的一年中，在民事方面共受理了一千余件婚姻案件（一九四八年前伪北平地方法院仅受理婚姻案件一百五十九件），其中离婚案件占百分之九十以上，三分之二是由女方提出来的，且大部分是二十岁到三十岁的青年妇女。在刑事方面共受理了五百余件婚姻案件，其中以妨害家庭的案件最多，如重婚或通奸等；其次为不堪虐待而涉讼的。这反映了解放后的北京人民，尤其是受压迫最深重的妇女，迫切地要求婚姻得到自由。
    北京市人民法院在婚姻法未公布前，是依照过去老解放区——晋冀鲁豫边区婚姻暂行条例，以自主自愿的一夫一妻制的原则处理婚姻案件的。一年中，北京市发生的婚姻问题，大约可分下面几种情况：
    关于一方坚持离婚的问题，人民法院首先审查双方的结合是否出诸自主自愿，然后了解坚持离婚的一方是否有充分的理由和条件，是否合乎人民政府的婚姻政策，以及双方是否还有继续维系感情的可能；这种维系对社会和双方是否有利。普通男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经调解无效时始予判决。一方坚决请求离婚的以京郊农村妇女和城市小市民妇女为最多。人民政府对受封建家庭压迫虐待的妇女，是坚决支持其获得解放的，但对婚姻问题采取轻率和不负责任的态度，则给以严格的教育与批评。有一个叫做李鲁氏的农村妇女，因受虐待坚决要求和她的丈夫李坤离婚。李鲁氏十几岁的时候，便由父母包办婚姻，把她嫁给了李坤。婚后双方感情不好，李鲁氏极受公婆和丈夫的虐待。她的公公曾强迫她从奸未成，因而恼差成怒，经常打骂。李鲁氏因不堪虐待，跑回娘家，直到北京解放后，便到人民法院来请求离婚。经法院几次审讯后，证明确为事实，乃给男方以严厉的批评和教育，判决离婚，并由男方负担女方目前的生活费用。
    关于重婚的问题。在国民党匪帮统治时代，伪六法全书上虽然标榜着一夫一妻制的条文，但实际上男子三妻四妾的重婚事实，却仍然是被允许的。这些妇女多是因天灾、人祸生活无着，或被男人欺骗而为妾的；也有个别因爱虚荣，爱金钱的落后享乐思想所支配而自愿给人做妾的。在旧社会里，她们是受着种种歧视，生活上完全失去了自由。有些妇女则因丈夫宠幸小妻而被遗弃；也有夫妻共同虐待为妾的。总之，在封建的极不合理的婚姻关系下，妇女精神肉体受着种种的痛苦。因此在北京解放后，许多做妾的不堪这种痛苦的处境，认识了人民政府婚姻自由的政策，自觉的请求离婚，也有原来的妻子提出，请求判决其夫与妾离婚的。人民法院掌握一夫一妻制的原则，打破这种不合理的封建婚姻关系而判决他们离婚。对发生在解放前的重婚罪，只给予严格的批评教育，不予治罪。至于解放以后发生的重婚事件，则须受刑事处分。如菜贩李福亭的女儿，二十岁时嫁给了一个比她大二十九岁的孙鸿，婚后她发现孙鸿还有妻子，并且十分虐待她，乃请求离婚，经法院判决准予离婚。
    至于妇女因家庭贫困而给人做养女或童养媳的，其所受压迫虐待更较其他为重，甚至有被迫卖淫的事情。年来人民法院受理的案件中，像这种不堪迫害而到法院控告的事情也不少，这在旧社会中是很少敢于申诉的；而人民政府则对这种受迫害的妇女，给以绝对的支持，而对强暴的封建势力，则给以应得的法律制裁。去年有一个十七岁的女孩张淑敏，曾向市人民法院要求脱离继养关系。当她五岁时，由她生父李文纯立字过继给张文贵夫妇作养女。而张姓夫妇专以借地供人奸宿，从中营利为生。一九四七年因张淑敏年龄已大，遂欲令为娼，为张淑敏所拒绝，张姓夫妇毒谋未遂，恼差成怒，乃时加打骂，终于一九四九年九月强令张淑敏与一汽车零件行商人孟祥茂奸宿，张姓夫妇并言明奸宿半个月，代价为五袋面粉。以后张姓夫妇又继续逼令张淑敏卖淫，张淑敏忍无可忍，乃向人民法院起诉，要求脱离继养关系。人民法院接受了张淑敏的合理要求，并对张文贵夫妇的罪恶行为各处徒刑五年，对张淑敏作必要的赔偿。
    关于干部离婚问题，这在离婚案件中也占相当大的数目字，而且多数是由男干部提出来的。据调查，这种情形多半是因为对过去父母包办的婚姻表示不满，或是双方思想上存在着距离及生活不到一起而请求离婚的。人民法院在处理这些问题时，多首先采取说服调解方法，因为双方或一方为革命干部，对政策法令有一定了解，且对思想落后的一方有帮助改造促其进步的义务。经调解无效后始判决离婚。这对革命工作与男女双方也都是有利的。如人民革命大学柴正之，于一九四○年由父母包办与郭淑秀结婚。婚后对不自由的婚姻感到痛苦，便于一九四二年出走，六年半未给家里写信。后来虽回家一趟也未和郭淑秀同居。而女方在结婚后完全把希望寄托在丈夫和孩子身上，丈夫坚决提出离婚，她认为“不名誉”，表示坚不同意，即使丈夫再找个妻子她也愿意。经调解无效，事实证明他们已无法再继续婚姻关系了，最后法院乃判决他们离婚。
    这些不幸的婚姻案件，是旧社会不合理的婚姻制度所造成的恶果，如果继续勉强维系，势必造成双方更大的痛苦。建立在自主自愿的一夫一妻制基础上的新的婚姻法，就是为了打破这种不合理现象，开拓美满幸福的家庭生活的道路。
