　　Decision on Implementation Procedures for Afforestation Plan
    Soviet People Warmly Support
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th] (TASS) - The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the implementation procedures for the plan to transform nature by planting farmland protective forest belts has been warmly supported by working farmers and agricultural workers. Specialized discussions have been held in collective farms and state farms in various regions, and specific measures have been decided upon.

    Pravda, Izvestia, and Trud have all published editorials discussing the realization of Stalin's plan to transform nature. Pravda stated: Under the common labor enthusiasm, collective farmers, power tillage personnel, state farm and forestry workers, experts, and scientific workers have all participated in the work, and in their work, they constantly experience the Stalin-style care of the Party and the government. The state is helping collective farms with a large number of machines and skilled personnel, and the land is becoming more fertile year by year. Soviet farmers are engaged in the work of ensuring that agriculture is free from natural disasters, in order to move towards years of bumper harvests. However, in capitalist countries, due to the plunder system of cultivating land, the land has been eroded and agricultural products are decreasing day by day. The governments of capitalist countries do not have, nor can they possibly adopt, fundamental measures to avoid such disasters.

　　植林计划履行程序决定
    苏联人民热烈拥护
    【新华社二十六日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联部长会议及联共中央关于种植农田防护林带的改造自然计划之执行程序的决定，获得劳动农民和农业工作者的热烈拥护。各地集体农场及国家农场都进行了专门讨论，并决定了具体措施。
    真理报、消息报、劳动报均发表社论，论述斯大林改造自然计划的实现。真理报称：在共同的劳动热情下，集体农民、动力耕作人员、国营农场和林场工人、专家和科学工作者都参加了工作，并在工作中经常体会到党和政府的斯大林式的关怀。国家正以大量机器和熟练人员帮助集体农场，田地一年比一年肥沃。苏联农民正从事于保障农业免于灾荒的工作，以走向年年丰收。但在资本主义国家内，由于耕作土地的掠夺制度，已使土地受到侵蚀，农产品日益减少。资本主义国家的政府，是没有也不可能采取避免此种灾祸的根本办法的。
