　　Photos of the Chongqing Massacre by the American Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
	The National Revolution Museum Prints a Copy for Loan to Local Organizations, Groups and Schools
　　[Report from this newspaper] The "Exhibition of Photos of the Chongqing Massacre by the American Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Bandits," organized by the Preparatory Office of the National Revolution Museum, closed on the 10th of this month. It was exhibited for a total of twenty-four days, with a total of 356 organizations and groups visiting, and a total audience of 105,219 people including individual visitors. The audience was extremely indignant at the heinous crimes of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in massacring the Chinese people. For example, Wang Qiang wrote in the comments book: After seeing these photos, the anger in my heart burns even more fiercely. This blood debt must be repaid by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. I must restrain my grief and work harder for the people's cause, and strive to eliminate the reactionaries as soon as possible. Lin Huizhuang wrote: We will never forget that this is the "gift" given to us by American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek; we must dispel illusions, resolutely struggle, and make this gang of bandits repay the blood debt. A junior high school student from Peimang Girls' High School wrote: After seeing these pictures, my hatred for the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits has deepened. I will study hard to avenge these martyred martyrs.
　　Now, in order to enable the people of all regions to further recognize the crimes of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in massacring the Chinese people, the office has reprinted a complete set of these photos for loan to various places for exhibition. Currently, eight units including Fu Jen Catholic University, North China People's Revolutionary University, Beihai Park Management Office, Beijing Municipal Second People's Education Center, Tsinghua University, Nanjing Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, Tangshan Municipal Education Bureau Social Education Section, and Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic League have registered for loan and exhibition. Exhibitions are being held in each unit in turn.
