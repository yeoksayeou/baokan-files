　　Handan Special District Strengthens Livestock Epidemic Prevention Work
    Inoculations Universally Given to Livestock in Five Counties
    Administrative Cadres Make Publicity and Preparations in Advance
    Attention Paid to Checking Livestock Health Before and After Inoculations
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Zhang Huanan reports: The Handan Special District of Hebei Province is strengthening epidemic prevention work for draft animals. The district propagated 10,928 head of livestock last year; however, due to the prevalence of animal diseases, livestock mortality reached 7,483 head. Animal diseases have continued to occur this spring. Therefore, the Special Commissioner's Office decided to vigorously carry out veterinary work, establish veterinary stations with a focus, and plans to universally administer livestock epidemic prevention inoculations in Shexian, Wu'an, Cixian, Cheng'an, and Handan counties, where animal diseases occurred last year. For epidemic areas in other counties, focused inoculations will be carried out. Since mid-March, with the assistance of technical personnel from the Hebei Provincial Government and the veterinary education and work stations of the Agricultural University, the district has formed epidemic prevention teams, which have already inoculated more than 47,500 head of livestock and treated more than 500 head of sick animals. The inoculation work is continuing.
    Before the commencement of inoculation work in various localities, local administrative cadres did a good job in publicity and preparation, demarcated inoculation areas, and determined inoculation locations and times. As soon as the epidemic prevention team arrived, inspection and inoculation were carried out. This improved work efficiency and saved time; at the same time, it also enabled the inoculation to be universal. For example, in Gunao Village, Zhangjiazhuang, Wangjindian and other places in Shexian County, more than 98 percent of the livestock were inoculated. However, in individual areas, due to insufficient coordination between administrative cadres and the epidemic prevention team, the inoculated livestock only accounted for one-third; also, inappropriate regulations regarding the time and location of assembly caused the masses to lead their livestock back and forth in vain.
    When carrying out inoculation, the epidemic prevention team first mobilized the masses to "compare livestock," gave verbal rewards to those who raised them well, and introduced common knowledge of livestock raising and health care, overcoming the masses' idea of emphasizing treatment over prevention. At the same time, they united local Chinese and Western veterinarians, mobilized them to assist in treatment work, and absorbed old veterinarians to participate in internships on the spot, helping them improve their skills. In addition, the epidemic prevention teams inspected the veterinary stations in various counties, helped them improve their work, so as to lay the foundation for grassroots epidemic prevention work.
    Experience in the work proves that inspection work before and after inoculation is extremely important. If there are sick livestock, they will be difficult to treat or die after inoculation, which will affect the credibility of the epidemic prevention team. For example, after the epidemic prevention team inoculated livestock in the second district of Shexian County, a horse died, and the masses suspected that it was "killed by the injection." Later, the district and village cadres convened a mass meeting, and the doctor dissected the dead horse, proving that it had contracted grass impaction before the injection, and introduced the symptoms, which dispelled the doubts of the masses and restored the reputation of the epidemic prevention team. The epidemic prevention team accepted this lesson, and in addition to strengthening the inspection before inoculation, they also left a part of the medical staff in the areas where inoculation has been carried out to generally check the health of livestock after inoculation, listen to the feedback from the masses, and re-inoculate livestock that have not been inoculated. Making the inoculation work more effective.

　　邯郸专区加强牲畜防疫工作
    普遍注射五县牲口
    行政干部事先作好宣传准备工作
    注射前后注意检查牲畜健康情形
    【本报讯】通讯员张化南报道：河北省邯郸专区加强耕畜防疫工作。该区去年繁殖了牲畜一万零九百二十八头；但因兽疫流行，死亡牲畜达七千四百八十三头。今春又不断发生畜疫。专署为此决定大力展开兽医工作，有重点地建立兽医站；并计划在去年发生畜疫的涉县、武安、磁县、成安、邯郸等五县，普遍施行牲畜防疫注射；对其他县的疫区，则进行有重点的注射。自三月中起，在河北省府与农业大学各兽医教育工作站技术人员的协助之下，该区已组成防疫队，现已注射了牲畜四万七千五百余头，治疗病畜五百余头。注射工作正在继续进行。
    各地在注射工作开始前，地方行政干部作好了宣传、准备工作，划好注射地区，拟定注射地点和时间，防疫队一到，即进行检查注射。这样，提高了工作效率，节省了时间；同时，也使注射能作到普遍，如涉县古脑村、张家庄、王金店等地，百分之九十八以上的牲口都打了针。但也有个别地区由于行政干部与防疫队配合不够，注射的牲口仅及三分之一；还有因集合时间、地点规定不适当，使群众牵着牲口徒劳往返的。
    防疫队在进行注射时，首先发动群众“比牲口”，对于喂养好的给以口头奖励，并介绍牲畜饲养、保健常识，克服群众重治疗轻防疫的思想。同时，又团结当地中、西兽医，发动他们协助治疗工作，并就地吸收旧兽医参加实习，帮助他们提高技术。此外，防疫队又检查各县兽医站，帮助他们改进工作，以打下下层防疫工作的基础。
    工作中的经验证明，注射前后的检查工作极为重要。如有带病牲畜，经过注射后不好治疗或致死亡，将影响防疫队的威信。如防疫队在涉县二区注射后死马一头，当时群众怀疑是“打针打死的”。后经区村干部召集群众大会，由医生将死马解剖，证明其打针前已患草结病，并介绍了病症情况，才解除了群众的疑虑，挽回了防疫队的信誉。防疫队接受了此一教训，除加强注射前的检查外，并在已进行注射的地区，留一部分医务人员普遍检查注射后牲畜的健康情况，听取群众反映；并为未注射的牲口补行注射。使注射工作收效更大。
