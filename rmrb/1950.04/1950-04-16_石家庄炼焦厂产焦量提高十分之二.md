　　Shijiazhuang Coking Plant Increases Coke Production by Two-Tenths
    [Our Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, after breaking its production level of the past twenty years in February this year (for details, see this edition of February 24th), has continued to create new production records up to April 1st. Since the official production of coke, the plant has always maintained a level of pushing fifteen small ovens and ten large ovens per day. After liberation, due to the increased class consciousness of the workers, they broke with conservative thinking and worked hard to improve firing techniques. By February 6th, they had reached a level of pushing sixteen small ovens and eleven large ovens per day, producing 2.7 tons more coke daily. Subsequently, they inspected the equipment in all areas and improved the quality of coal used. As of April 1st, it has increased to pushing eighteen small ovens and twelve large ovens per day. The coking time has also been shortened compared to the past, with small ovens reduced from 32 hours to 26 hours, and large ovens reduced from 24 hours to 20 hours. The daily coke production has increased from 101 tons to 125 tons, and the quality fully meets the ironmaking standards.
    In the process of increasing furnaces, in addition to adjusting necessary machinery, meetings of relevant staff were held each time, focusing on breaking down ideological concerns and clarifying responsibilities to enhance employee confidence and responsibility. However, because all the equipment in the plant is extremely old, the production increase work is carried out gradually and steadily. A detailed inspection is carried out before each furnace increase to ensure safety. Now, the plant has accepted the advice of Soviet experts from the Anshan Iron and Steel Coking Plant and is studying how to improve the speed and quantity of air entering the combustion chamber to further adjust the temperature in order to achieve another production increase.

　　石家庄炼焦厂产焦量提高十分之二
    【本报讯】石家庄炼焦厂继今年二月突破二十余年来生产水平之后（详情见二月二十四日本版），至四月一日，又连续创造生产新纪录。该厂自正式出焦炭以来，一直是保持住日推十五小炉、十大炉的水平。解放后，由于工友们阶级觉悟提高，打破了保守思想，努力改进烧火技术，至二月六日已达日推十六小炉、十一大炉，每日多产焦炭二·七吨。继又检查了各处设备，提高了用煤质量。截至四月一日，已增为日推十八小炉、十二大炉。炼焦时间亦较前缩短，小炉由三十二小时减为二十六小时；大炉由二十四小时减至二十小时。每日产焦炭量由一○一吨增为一二五吨，质量完全合乎炼铁标准。
    在增炉过程中，除调整必要的机械外，每次均召开有关工作人员会议，着重打破思想顾虑，明确职责，以增强员工信心和责任。但该厂因各种设备均极陈旧，故增产工作采取逐步稳进，每次增炉前均经过详细检查，以保证安全。现该厂接受鞍钢炼焦厂苏联专家的意见，正在研究改进燃烧室空气进入的速度与数量，进一步调整温度，以达再度增产的目的。
