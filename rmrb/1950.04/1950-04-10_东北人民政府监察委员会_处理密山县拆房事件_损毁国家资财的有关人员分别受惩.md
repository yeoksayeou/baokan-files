　　Northeast People's Government Supervisory Committee
    Handles the Mishan County House Demolition Incident
    Personnel Responsible for Damaging State Assets Punished
    The Main Reason for this Incident was Departmentalism

    [This newspaper's report] Special correspondent Ai Fang reports: In January of this year, Military Factory No. 24, stationed in Mishan County, violated national laws and demolished state-owned buildings, causing enormous losses to state property. After this serious incident occurred, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, paid great attention to it and immediately instructed the Supervisory Committee to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation in cooperation with relevant departments. The facts and responsibilities have now been clarified, and those responsible for the mistakes have been given appropriate punishments based on the severity of their offenses.
    Mishan County is under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Province. Before August 15th, it was the location of the Japanese invaders' "Defense Headquarters," so there were many warehouses, buildings, and transportation equipment. After August 15th, these warehouses and buildings were partially damaged by residents, but after sorting and repairs, most of them were restored. After the liberation of Shenyang, government agencies and factories moved south, leaving many vacant public houses in Mishan County. Because the local government failed to take responsibility for protecting state assets, theft and destruction became rampant for a time. Even in houses that were permanently occupied, some were transferred from one person to another, with everyone only knowing how to use them and not how to take care of them. One large building in the county, with an area of more than 3,980 square meters and complete heating and water systems, was repaired and used by a school in 1946. When the school moved in 1948, it sold the public house to an electrical factory for 5 million Northeast currency. The electrical factory then transferred it to Military Factory No. 24. Because the factory found the houses scattered and difficult to manage, it proposed to the county government to hand them over, but the county government did not accept them. Zhou Ming, director of Military Factory No. 24, and Wei Zuye, deputy director, then proposed to Hou Kai, the former county magistrate of Mishan County, and Chen Yingtong, the secretary of the county party committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to demolish the houses and use the dismantled materials as the factory's repair materials for this year. The former county magistrate and county party committee secretary of Mishan County agreed to this idea without principle. Starting from January 10th, the building was completely demolished in one month, the usable materials were transported away, and what remained were some broken frames. This was a great loss. According to the report of the investigation team of the Northeast People's Government Supervisory Committee: calculating that each square meter of house construction requires 400,000 RMB (equivalent to 4 million Northeast currency; all figures below are in RMB), it would cost approximately 1.6 billion RMB to repair and construct this building. Deducting half for depreciation, it would still require 800 million RMB. Based on current construction prices, it would cost 140 million RMB to reconstruct using the dismantled materials. An even greater loss was that the demolition of the houses by Military Factory No. 24 damaged the government's decree prohibiting the demolition of houses and lowered the government's prestige among the masses. At the people's representative conference of Dong'an District, when the government proposed to prohibit the demolition of buildings, some representatives said, "The common people are not allowed to demolish, so why does the military industrial department's factory still demolish?"
    This incident has been preliminarily dealt with. Based on the report of the investigation team, the Northeast People's Government Supervisory Committee, after careful study, put forward opinions, which were approved by the Northeast People's Government. It was decided to give the comrades who made mistakes the following punishments:
    Zhou Ming, director of Military Factory No. 24, is a Communist Party member. He only saw the interests of his own factory and did not see the interests of the state. He even proposed demolishing state buildings, causing huge losses to the state. Judging from the bad consequences of this matter, he should be dismissed from his post for investigation. Considering that this member has consistently worked hard in the past and made considerable contributions, and that he has already conducted a self-criticism after the incident, it was decided to give him a punishment of dismissal but retaining his position. The party decided to give him a public warning within the party.
    Deputy Director Wei Zuye, who assisted the director in demolishing state buildings, was given a demerit.
    Hou Kai, the former county magistrate of Mishan County, is a Communist Party member. This time, he agreed to demolish state buildings and abandoned the government's responsibility to protect state assets, causing serious errors. Based on the degree of his mistake and the extent of his reflection, the Northeast People's Government decided to give him a major demerit. The party decided to give him a public warning within the party.
    Zhang Shuxian, the current county magistrate of Mishan County, is a Communist Party member. Although Comrade Zhang Shuxian had only recently assumed the position of county magistrate and was not involved in the demolition of the houses, he did not report it to higher authorities afterwards. When the Northeast Daily sent a letter to inquire, he only "glanced" at the letter. This is also an irresponsible attitude towards state assets and it was decided to give him a criticism.
    Chen Yingtong, the secretary of the Mishan County Party Committee, and Gu Dancheng, the secretary of the general party branch of Military Factory No. 24, disregarded state losses and the impact on the masses and agreed to demolish state buildings. The above two comrades have conducted self-reflection on their mistakes. Based on the severity of their mistakes and the extent of their understanding of the mistakes, the party decided to give them public warnings and admonishments, respectively.
    From the incident of the demolition of state buildings by Military Factory No. 24 in Northeast China, two main problems in the thinking and work style of the responsible comrades of the factory and the party and government leading cadres of Mishan County are exposed. The first is the lack of a comprehensive perspective and the idea of departmentalism. As Hou Kai said in a letter, he believed that "Dong'an is mainly agricultural, and factories will not be established," and that "the number of people is decreasing day by day, and the prospects for development are not great." Therefore, they could not seriously manage state assets and allowed people to steal them. In fact, it objectively encouraged theft. For example, one of the county's arrangements for the masses' sideline production was to collect hardware materials. The masses will not produce hardware materials, and the scattered hardware materials are also limited. Most of them are going to destroy state buildings to obtain hardware materials. In fact, it is not "saving the country's huge expenses," nor is it production, but the destruction of the country's buildings. This is "only seeing the present, not seeing the future, only seeing Dong'an, not seeing the whole country," or only seeing one's own unit.
    This incident of demolishing state houses also reflects the bureaucratic and careless work style of some staff. Zhou Ming, the director of Military Factory No. 24, proposed to demolish state buildings for the benefit of his unit. Hou Kai, the former county magistrate of the county, and Chen Yingtong, the secretary of the county party committee, also casually agreed to the demolition indifferently. After the incident occurred, the Social Services Group of the Northeast Daily sent a letter to inquire, but Zhang Shuxian, the current county magistrate, only "glanced" at the letter and ignored it. There was neither prior request for instructions nor subsequent reporting, and the decision to request instructions and report was made a year ago, but it has not been seriously implemented to this day.
    The third is the issue of criticism and self-criticism. This incident reflects that some comrades lack the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Zhang Shuxian, the current county magistrate of Mishan County, only "glanced" at a letter inquiring about such a major matter. When the newspaper published the initial understanding of the incident, Comrade Hou Kai only "read it twice." It was not until Comrade Gao Gang raised this matter in his report at the First Party Congress of the Northeast Region of the Chinese Communist Party that he "felt that the matter was a bit serious."
    This fully demonstrates that these comrades do not attach enough importance to using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to correct shortcomings in their work. Comrades Zhou Ming, Hou Kai, Chen Yingtong, and Zhang Shuxian have already reflected on and examined their mistakes and publicly published their self-criticism reports in the Northeast Daily.

　　东北人民政府监察委员会
    处理密山县拆房事件     
    损毁国家资财的有关人员分别受惩
    发生此次事件主要原因是本位主义思想            
    【本报讯】特派记者艾方报道：今年一月间，驻密山县军工二十四厂，违犯国家法令，拆毁国家建筑，造成国家财产的浩大损失。这一严重事件发生后，东北人民政府高岗主席极为注意，当即指示监察委员会派员协同有关部门前往实地调查，现已将事实经过及责任究查清楚，并依情节轻重，予犯错误人员以应得的处分。
    密山县属松江管辖。“八一五”前，为日寇之“国防司令部”驻地，因此仓库、房产建筑、交通器材很多。“八一五”后这些仓库、建筑曾被部分居民所破坏，后经整理修补，已经大部恢复。沈阳解放后，机关、工厂南迁，密山县空出公房很多。由于当地政府未能负起保护国家资财的责任，致偷盗、破坏一时成风。就是长住的房子，有些也是你转给我，我转给你，大家只知使用，不知爱护。该县有一所面积三千九百八十多平方公尺、暖气、水道等设备完整的巨大建筑，一九四六年，由某学校修补住用，至一九四八年该校搬家，竟以公房作价东北币五百万元卖给电器工厂；电器工厂后又转交给军工二十四厂。该厂因房子分散不好看管，曾向县政府提出移交，县政府没有接收。军工二十四厂厂长周明、副厂长魏祖冶乃向该县原县长侯凯及中共县委书记陈应廷提出拆毁房屋，利用拆下的材料，作为该厂今年的修建器材的意见。密山县前任县长和县党委书记无原则的同意了这个意见。从一月十日开始，一个月中即将这一所建筑拆光，能用的材料运走，剩下的是一些破房框子。这是一个很大的损失。根据东北人民政府监察委员会调查组的报告：以每建一平方公尺房子需四十万元人民币计算（合东北币四百万，以下数字均为人民币），修造这所建筑，约需十六亿元，减去一半折旧，尚需八亿元，按现在修建价格，以所拆材料重修，亦需一亿四千万元。而更大的一个损失，是此次军工二十四厂拆毁房屋，破坏了政府禁止拆毁房屋的法令，降低了政府在群众中的威信。东安区人民代表会上，政府提出禁止拆毁建筑时，有的代表就说：“不叫老百姓拆，军工部的工厂为什么还拆？”
    此事件已作初步处理，东北人民政府监察委员会根据调查组的报告，经过详密研究，提出意见，经东北人民政府批准，决定给犯错误同志以如下处分：
    军工二十四厂厂长周明，系共产党员。他只看到本厂的利益，没有看到国家利益，竟向县政府提出拆毁国家建筑的意见，使国家遭受浩大损失。从这个事情的恶果来看，应撤职查办。政府体念该员过去工作一贯努力，并有相当贡献，此次事件发生后，他已进行了检讨，决定给予撤职留任处分。党内决定予以当众警告处分。
    副厂长魏祖冶，协助厂长拆毁国家建筑，予以记过一次的处分。
    密山县原任县长侯凯，系共产党员。这次他竟同意拆毁国家建筑，放弃政府保护国家资财的责任，造成严重错误。东北人民政府根据其错误及反省的程度，决定予以记大过一次的处分。党内决定予以当众警告处分。
    密山县现任县长张树先，系共产党员。张树先同志虽然接受县长职务不久，未参与拆毁房子的事情，但事后不向上级报告，东北日报曾去信询问，他只将信“浏览一下”，这也是对国家资财不负责任的态度，决定予以批评。
    密山县党委书记陈应廷、军工二十四厂中共总支书记顾达成，不顾国家损失与群众影响，同意拆毁国家建筑。以上两同志对自己所犯错误，已进行了反省检讨。根据其错误轻重及其对错误认识的程度，党决定分别予以当众警告与劝告的处分。
    从东北军工二十四厂拆毁国家建筑的事件中，暴露了该工厂的负责同志及密山县党政领导干部思想、作风上的两个主要问题。首先是缺乏从全面看问题的观点，和本位主义的思想。如侯凯同志一封信中所说的，以为“东安以农业为主，工厂不会建立”，“人数日渐稀少，发展前途不大”，因之就不能认真管理国家资产，任人偷盗。甚至于在客观上鼓励了偷盗，如该县布置群众副业生产中，其中竟有一条是搜集五金材料。群众是不会生产五金材料的，同时散存的五金材料也有限，大多是去炸毁国家建筑，来取得五金材料。事实上，不是“节省国家的庞大开支”，更不是生产，而是破坏了国家的建筑。这是“只看到了现在，并未看到将来，只看到了东安，并未看到全国”，或者是只看到了自己的一单位。
    此次拆毁国家房屋事件，也反映了某些工作人员，官僚主义的，粗枝大叶的作风。军工二十四厂厂长周明同志为了本单位的利益，提议拆毁国家建筑。该县原县长侯凯、县委书记陈应廷同志也就漠不关心地随便答应可以拆。事情发生后，东北日报社会服务组曾去信查询，现任县长张树先同志，只是将信“浏览一下”，就置之不理。事前既不请示，事后也不报告，而请示报告制度的决定是在一年前的事，直到现在仍未认真执行。
    其此是批评与自我批评的问题，这次事件中反映了一部份同志缺乏批评与自我批评的精神。现任密山县长张树先同志，对一封查询这样重大事情的信件，只是“浏览一下”。当报上发表了对这次事件初步了解的情况时，侯凯同志就只“看了两遍”，到中共东北区第一届党代表会上高岗同志在报告中提出这件事的时候，才“觉得事情有点重大”。
    这就充分的表现了这些同志对于运用批评与自我批评的武器改正工作缺点的重视之不足。周明、侯凯、陈应廷及张树先等同志，对自己的错误已经作过反省与检讨，并在东北日报公开发表了他们的检讨报告。
