Xinhua News Agency, 16th: In the production and construction work carried out by the People's Liberation Army, the vast majority of units have strictly abided by policies and disciplines, united the masses, and acted in a planned and prepared manner. However, a small number of units have made some mistakes and deviations due to insufficient production education for soldiers and a lack of understanding of the significance of troop production. These mistakes or deviations have been promptly corrected by leaders at all levels.

A small number of units have not conducted in-depth production education according to Chairman Mao's instructions, resulting in violations of policies and disciplines. For example, a few units of the troops stationed in Guangdong, starting from a purely profit-seeking point of view, engaged in commercial activities, and a few individuals even went to Hong Kong to traffic in goods, and some even sheltered smuggling and tax evasion. Some units purchased large quantities of materials needed for production directly in the market without going through local trade departments, thereby stimulating price increases; some bought goods but did not pay taxes. The phenomenon of indiscriminate logging has been found in many areas. Some troops cut down tung trees, tea trees, fruit trees, and useful trees for firewood; some even cut down the private mountains of the masses, arousing resentment. A deputy company commander of a certain company led soldiers to steal trees from the masses. The soldiers reflected that they should not do this, but the leading cadres of the company did not accept the soldiers' opinions, which led to low morale in the entire company. Some units did not make good preparations before production, temporarily borrowed farm tools from the masses, and did not compensate for the damage in time.

At the same time, some units did not conduct good investigation and research in advance and set very high plans, which resulted in failure. A certain regiment of the Pingyuan Military Region made a plan to plant 3,000 mu of land beside Weishan Lake. Without detailed investigation or contact with the local government, they sent troops there. As a result, they found that the land was not suitable for cultivation and had to travel a long distance to another place. The soldiers reflected, "The higher-ups have no plan, today they tell us to go east, tomorrow they tell us to go west!" Some units, due to a lack of long-term planning, made excessive assaults, which affected the health of the soldiers. For example, when a certain unit of the troops stationed in Dihua was building the Heping Canal, the commanders and fighters were extremely enthusiastic, but there was a deviation of overwork. Some people slept only two hours a day at noon out of the twenty-four hours of day and night. The superiors stipulated that each person should pull an average of 50 jin of stones per day, but some people pulled as much as 294 jin, so some people fainted, got sick, and some even had their wounds recur. A staff officer of the Puyang Sub-district of the Pingyuan Military Region vomited blood after two days of shock production; several soldiers of the direct detachment of the Heze Sub-district fell ill due to excessive assaults in the first week of the embankment restoration project. Individual units stationed in Hunan worked for eleven hours a day, which greatly affected the production morale and the progress of production work. In addition, some units did not consult the masses for production knowledge. They bought livestock such as pigs and chickens but did not know how to raise them, and they all died.

The above-mentioned mistakes and deviations have been promptly discovered and corrected by leaders at all levels. The Central South Military Region and the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army have successively issued circulars to the entire army, strictly prohibiting troops from engaging in commercial activities and harming the interests of the masses, and from indiscriminately logging forests in production; and notified all units to pay attention to inspection at any time. The Guangdong Military Region Headquarters also issued a circular strictly prohibiting activities that violate policies and disciplines. A certain unit of the troops stationed in northern Guangdong specially organized an inspection team to inspect the production policies and disciplines of the troops. At the same time, many units invited old farmers to have discussions and asked them for production knowledge.

　　部队生产应严守纪律  禁止从事商业等活动
    中南军区和四野通报检查偏向
    【新华社十六日讯】人民解放军各部在展开生产建设工作中，绝大多数的单位都做到了严格遵守政策、纪律，团结群众，有计划、有准备；但也有少数单位由于对战士们的生产教育工作进行得不够，对部队生产的意义认识不足，因而发生一些错误和偏向。对于这些错误或偏向，各级领导方面已予及时纠正。
    少数单位没有根据毛主席的指示来进行深入的生产教育，因而产生违犯政策、纪律的行为。如驻广东部队的少数单位，从单纯营利观点出发，从事商业活动，甚至有少数人员私去香港贩运货物，个别的还有包庇走私、漏税的行为。有的单位不经过当地贸易机关而自行在市场上收购大批生产所需的物资，以致刺激物价上涨；有的买了货又不纳税。滥伐林木的现象，在较多地区都有发现。有些部队将桐、茶、果树和有用的树木都砍作柴烧；有的还砍了群众的私山，引起群众反感。某连副连长带着战士偷砍群众的树，战士们反映说不该这样做，该连领导干部不接受战士意见，因此使全连生产情绪低落。有些单位生产前没有作好准备工作，临时借用群众农具，损坏了又没有及时赔偿。
    同时，有些单位事先没有经过很好的调查研究，订出很高的计划，结果落了空。平原军区某团订了在微山湖旁种地三千亩的计划，既没有详细调查，又没有与当地政府接好头就把部队开去，结果发现土地不适于耕种，跑了很远的路又折向别处。战士们反映说：“上级没有计划，今天叫上东，明天又叫上西！”有的单位由于没有作长期打算，过分突击，影响战士的健康。如迪化驻军某部修和平渠时，指战员们劳动热忱极为高涨，但发生了劳动过度的偏向。有的人在昼夜二十四小时中只睡两小时的午睡。上级规定每人每天平均拉石五十斤，有的人竟拉了二百九十四斤，因此有些人就晕倒、生病，还有些人伤口复发。平原军区濮阳分区的一个参谋突击生产两天，累得吐血；菏泽分区直属队在复堤工程第一周中过分突击，几个战士因而病倒。驻湖南的个别单位一天劳动十一小时，这样大大影响了生产情绪，也影响生产工作的进行。另外有些单位不向群众请教生产知识，买了猪、鸡等家畜回来不会养，都死掉了。
    上面说的这些错误和偏向，都经各级领导方面及时发现并予纠正。中南军区和第四野战军政治部已接连通报全军，严格禁止部队生产中从事商业活动和损害群众利益、滥伐林木的行为；并通报各部随时注意检查。广东军区司令部也发出通令，严禁违犯政策、纪律的活动。粤北驻军某部特别组织了检查组，检查部队生产政策和纪律。同时很多单位都请老农座谈，向他们请教生产知识。
