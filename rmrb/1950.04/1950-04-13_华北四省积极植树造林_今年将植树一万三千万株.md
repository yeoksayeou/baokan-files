Xinhua News Agency, April 11th—Four provinces in North China, namely Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, have launched extensive tree-planting and afforestation campaigns. These four provinces will plant a total of over 130 million trees and sow seeds on 390,000 mu of barren mountains for afforestation this year.

    To implement the above-mentioned tree-planting and afforestation plan, Hebei Province has decided to organize the masses to plant large-scale protective forest belts and farmland forest networks in sandy areas in a planned manner; in mountainous areas, vigorously organize sowing and afforestation on barren mountains to conserve water and prevent erosion; and systematically plant flood control forest belts along both sides of rivers. The province has also decided that in areas with large sandy and barren mountain areas and better conditions, based on the principle of mutual benefit and voluntarism, it will focus on mobilizing the masses to contribute labor, saplings, and land as shares to organize various forms of afforestation mutual aid groups and afforestation cooperatives, and democratically formulate methods for profit sharing, afforestation, and forest protection. The province launched a "Afforestation Week" and "Afforestation Ten Days" blitz before the Qingming Festival. As of March 25, the province had planted more than 1,559,000 trees and eliminated more than 20,000 mu of sandy wasteland.

    The Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau organized technical extension teams and afforestation teams, which went to various places in February to help with tree planting. The provincial government has instructed local authorities to ensure that 60% of the afforestation work in sandy areas and along both sides of major rivers is completed in the spring. State-owned forests should pay a certain price to mobilize the masses to complete the tree planting tasks; county-owned forests can sign contracts with the masses and adopt a profit-sharing system; village-owned forests will be managed and operated by the villagers, and forestry agencies can provide technical guidance. Xinxian Prefecture in the province launched a "Ten-Day Tree Planting Campaign" in early April, aiming to plant one tree per person throughout the county and 3.25 million trees along the river areas. The Railway General Trade Union of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau called on all employees to launch a campaign to plant one million trees.

    Chahar Province has decided that those who sow seeds in barren mountains and sandy areas will own what they plant, in order to encourage the masses to plant trees and create forests. The government will also solve the difficulties of the masses in obtaining saplings and seeds based on specific circumstances. Zhangjiakou City has established an afforestation committee to unify the leadership of afforestation and forest protection work in order to complete the plan of planting 850,000 trees and sowing seeds on 10,000 mu of barren mountains.

    Suiyuan Province plans to plant more than 2.43 million trees this year, and a mass tree-planting and afforestation upsurge has already begun.

    华北四省积极植树造林
    今年将植树一万三千万株
    【新华社十一日讯】河北、山西、察哈尔、绥远四省已展开广泛的植树造林运动。上述四省今年将共植树一万三千余万株，荒山播种造林三十九万亩。
    为贯彻上述植树造林计划，河北省确定在沙荒地区，组织群众有计划地植造大型防护林带与耕地防林网；在山岳地区大力组织荒山播种造林，以保水分，防止冲刷；河流两岸则有计划地植造防洪林带。该省并决定在沙荒、山荒面积较大、条件较好的地区，本自愿两利原则，有重点地发动群众以人力、树秧、土地入股，组织各种形式的造林互助组与造林合作社，民主订立分红、造林、护林等办法。该省于清明节前展开“造林周”、“造林旬”的突击运动，截至三月二十五日止，全省已植树一百五十五万九千余株，消灭沙荒两万余亩。
    山西省林业局组织了技术推广队及造林队，于二月间曾分赴各地帮助植树工作。省府已指示各地，要求沙荒造林及沿各主要河流两岸的植树工作在春季完成百分之六十。国有林应付出一定代价，发动群众完成植树任务；县有林可和群众订立合同，采取分红制度；村有林由村中群众管理经营，林业机关可帮助技术指导。该省忻县专区于本月上旬已开展“十日植树运动”，拟做到全县每人植树一棵，沿河区植树三百二十五万株。太原铁路局铁路总工会号召全体职工展开栽树一百万株的运动。
    察哈尔省决定：在荒山及荒沙地区播种者，谁种归谁，以奖励群众植树造林。政府并根据具体情况，解决群众树秧树籽困难。张家口市为完成植树八十五万株、荒山播种一万亩的计划，已成立了造林委员会，统一领导造林及护林工作。
    绥远省计划今年植树二百四十三万余株，现已展开群众性的植树造林热潮。
