　　Starting Production and Other Matters
　　Edited by Song Wenmao
　　　　　　Soldier Poetry Collection
    Our troops, following Chairman Mao's production instructions, participated in water conservancy projects such as building dikes and repairing canals around mid-March. The soldiers loved labor and, like in past battles, competed to be labor heroes. From the following poems by soldiers, you can see their fervent emotions.
    Some of these poems were passed down orally by soldiers (like the poem "Ramming"); some were written as wall newspaper contributions; and some were quick verses posted on tools. I thought they were very good, so I transcribed a few, making slight modifications to individual sentences, which I hereby declare.
           Starting Production
　
    Hearing we're starting production,
    Joy in our hearts, smiles on our faces,
    Pickaxes and shovels all prepared,
    Soil baskets and carrying poles on our shoulders.
    No trains to ride, we'll travel on foot, (Note 1)
    Not adding any burden to the nation.
    Every one of us is an iron-legged hero,
    Who would want to be a "dud egg"?
    One says:
    "If you can't carry it, give it to me."
    Another says:
    "Don't underestimate people like that."
    Just hoping to reach the destination soon,
    Measure out our sections and get to work quickly!
　
           Opening Canals and Repairing Dikes
　
    Repairing the canal, a real blessing,
    Constant water flow, clear and sparkling,
    Watering the crops, making them fat and strong,
    Harvesting grain, filling the granaries full.
    Dig the river well, repair the dike strong,
    Guarantee no floods to cause harm,
    Protecting life and property for all,
    Farmers living good days.
　
           Sharpening Shovels
　
    Talking about digging the river, not slacking off,
    "Scritch, scritch" sharpening the shovels,
    The shovels sharpened bright and shining,
    Digging mud and excavating soil is really convenient.
    Those carrying soil, take a look,
    Baskets filling as soon as they're set down,
    Not afraid of your legs running fast.
    My shovel wasn't sharpened in vain,
    We'll get to sit in an airplane. (Note 2)
    Others say we are heroes,
    But we wouldn't dare say that.
　
           Ramming (Sung while ramming)
　
    We're repairing the dike, for the people,
    Fighting team, production army,
    Chairman's words, kept in our hearts,
    Heave-ho, hey heave…
    More effort!
    All hands together, raise the ram high,
    Plum blossom petals, (Note 3) ramming well,
    New river dike, rammed strong,
    Heave-ho, hey heave…
    The people, say we're good!

Appendix:
      (One) "Traveling on foot" is a local Hebei term, meaning walking.
      (Two) "We'll get to sit in an airplane" means working happily and getting first place.
      (Three) "Plum blossom petals" refers to the impression left by the wooden ram during ramming, which looks like plum blossom petals.

　　出发生产及其他
    宋文茂辑
            战士诗抄
    我们的部队，按照毛主席的生产指示，于三月中旬，前后参加了打堤修渠的水利工程。战士们热爱劳动，和过去作战一样，个个争作劳动英雄。从下面这几首战士诗里，可以看出他们这种火热的情绪。
    这几首诗，有的是战士口传的（如《打夯》这一首）；有的是他们写的墙报稿子；有的是贴在工具上的快板；我认为很好，抄录了几首，其中个别句子略加了一些修改，特此声明。
           出发生产
　
    听说出发去生产，
    喜在心头笑在脸，
    镐头、铁铣准备全，
    土篮子、扁担放在肩。
    不坐火车地下撵，（注一）
    不给国家添负担。
    个个都是铁脚汉，
    谁肯落个“草鸡蛋”？
    这个说：
    “你背不动快给咱。”
    那个说：
    “别那么把人来小看。”
    只盼到了目的地，
    量好工段快着干！
　
           开渠和修堤
　
    修好渠，真沾光，
    常流水，清汪汪，
    浇的庄稼肥又壮，
    打的粮食灌满仓。
    河挖好，堤修牢，
    保证不把水灾闹，
    生命财产都能保，
    农民日子过的好。
　
           磨铁铣
　
    说挖河，不怠慢，
    “刺楞，刺楞”磨铁铣，
    铁铣磨的亮又亮，
    挖泥掘土真便当。
    挑土的，你看一看，
    篮子一放土就满，
    不怕你两腿跑的欢。
    俺的铁铣没白磨，
    一架飞机咱来坐。（注二）
    别人说咱是英雄，
    咱可不敢那么说。
　
           打夯（打夯时口里唱着）
　
    咱修堤，为人民，
    战斗队，生产军，
    主席话，记在心，
    嗨哟，嘿嗨……
    多加油（来）多使劲！
    齐动手，夯举高，
    梅花瓣，（注三）砸的好，
    新河堤，打得牢，
    嗨哟，嘿嗨……
    老百姓，说咱好！附注：（一）“地下撵”是冀中的土话，步行的意思。
      （二）“一架飞机咱来坐”是说干的欢，得了第一的意思。
      （三）“梅花瓣”是打夯时木夯落的印，形状好象梅花瓣。
