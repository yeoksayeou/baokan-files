　　Ideological Remolding Cannot Be Rushed
    *China Youth* Editorial

The New Democratic Youth League Central Committee’s publication, *China Youth*, published an editorial in its 36th issue titled "Ideological Remolding Cannot Be Rushed." The full text is as follows:

In schools in the newly liberated areas, students have launched New Democratic studies and are undergoing ideological remolding. This ideological remolding primarily aims to eliminate the influence of imperialism and the reactionary classes spread within students' minds, and secondly, to remold petty-bourgeois ideology. Although the petty bourgeoisie are one of the four friends, the characteristics of this class, such as its laxity, its attachment to private ownership, its disdain for labor, and its supra-class viewpoints, when reflected in students, will hinder them from becoming good builders of the new China if they are not remolded. Over the past year, many schools have achieved great success in the ideological remolding of students, shedding old burdens and beginning to establish a revolutionary worldview. However, a few schools have displayed an over-eagerness in the ideological remolding of students. Such schools treat the remolding of student ideology as a crash task, demanding that a school-wide wave of ideological self-criticism be launched within a few short days. They do not consider the target, conditions, or the degree of awareness, attempting to immediately and completely defeat all non-proletarian ideologies existing in all students throughout the school. They seek out exemplary individuals among League members and the masses, asking them to reflect and self-criticize, and the self-criticism focuses on ideas such as "purely technical viewpoints" and "individualism." There are also actions similar to the "Three Checks" campaign, in which the affairs of three generations of ancestors are brought out for criticism. If one self-criticism is not considered profound enough, further pursuit is demanded. An ideological summary must be discussed and revised more than ten times. Furthermore, for students who are lagging behind, so-called methods of "attacking backward fortresses" and "besieging" are adopted, demanding that they immediately clear their minds within one or two days.

This approach is incorrect. First of all, we must understand that petty-bourgeois ideology has social roots in the general students from petty-bourgeois backgrounds. Remolding the petty bourgeoisie is a fairly long-term process. We cannot and should not use the methods of party rectification and rectification of work styles to rectify the thinking of ordinary school students; we cannot use the standards of a Communist Party member to measure ordinary school students, requiring them to defeat all non-proletarian ideologies in a short period. Moreover, in fact, even a Communist Party member from a non-proletarian background, after participating in the revolution, must constantly strive in long-term revolutionary practice to defeat and eliminate non-proletarian ideology. According to past experience, remolding the thinking of school students mainly relies on New Democratic studies, enabling students to establish a revolutionary outlook on life through learning. Ideological remolding can be carried out during certain periods (such as holidays) through participation in land reform, labor service, and other movements, but fundamentally it still relies on learning. This is a work of patient persuasion and education. We must adopt an attitude of patient guidance and kindness. If the following atmosphere prevails during self-criticism, that is, the so-called "killing atmosphere," "sharpening knives," and "pursuing enemies," then those who are besieged, although they frankly expose their thoughts, inevitably engage in far-fetched interpretations, rigidly attributing all past mistakes, large and small, to a "leading ideological source." Even cheating on exams is elevated to a "sin in hell." If the mistake is admitted, it is only because of fear of being attacked, not because of ideological understanding, so they do not understand themselves, and it increases latent resentment. In this way, the meaning of ideological remolding is lost, the excellent quality of adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes cannot be cultivated, and new obstacles are added to the mind.

In short, we believe that the progress of students' thinking mainly lies in carrying out New Democratic studies, strengthening the study of political classes, and cultivating a correct viewpoint of serving the people. Strengthen the study of cultural and scientific courses to cultivate their basic knowledge to serve the people. Only by strengthening various courses can we improve ourselves ideologically. Comrades, we need to study better now.

### 改造思想，急性不得  《中国青年》社论

　　改造思想，急性不得
    《中国青年》社论
    【新华社讯】新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物《中国青年》第三十六期以“改造思想，急性不得”为题，发表社论。全文如下：
    新区各学校学生，在学校里开展了新民主主义学习，进行了思想的改造。这一思想改造，主要是消灭帝国主义及反动阶级在学生思想中散布的影响，再就是改造小资产阶级思想。因为小资产阶级虽是四个朋友之一，但这一阶级的散漫性、私有性、轻视劳动、超阶级观点等等思想反映在学生中，如不加以改造，是会妨害他们成为很好的新中国的建设者的。一年来，许多学校学生思想改造有了很大的成就，抛弃了旧的包袱，开始建立了革命人生观；但是，有个别学校，对于学生的思想改造，却产生了过急的偏向。这样的学校把改造学生思想看做一个突击任务，要求在短短几天之内，掀起全校性的思想检讨热潮；他们不问对象、条件、觉悟的程度，企图把存在于全校一切学生中的一切非无产阶级的思想，立刻完全打垮；在团员和群众中间，来寻找典型，让他们反省检讨；而检讨的又是“单纯技术观点”、“个人主义”等思想；还有类似“三查”的行动，祖宗三代的事情都拿出来批判；检讨一次，觉得还不深刻，还要再次地追；一个思想总结，要讨论修改十几次，甚至，对于中间落后的同学，还采取所谓“打落后堡垒”、“围攻”等办法，要他们在一两天之内，立刻打通思想。
    这种作法是不正确的。首先我们必须了解：小资产阶级思想，在一般小资产阶级出身的学生身上是有着社会根源的。改造小资产阶级是一个相当长期的过程。我们不可能也不应该用整党整风的办法，来整顿普通学校学生的思想；用一个共产党员的标准来衡量普通学校的学生，要求他们在短期内打垮一切非无产阶级的思想。何况事实上，就是一个非无产阶级出身的共产党员，参加革命以后，也须在长期革命实践中，不断地努力，才能打垮与肃清非无产阶级思想。根据以往的经验，改造学校学生的思想，主要是依靠新民主主义的学习，使学生从学习中树立起革命人生观。在一定时期（如假期）中可以通过参加土地改革、劳动服务等运动，进行思想改造，而在根本上还是依靠学习。这是一个耐心说服教育的工作。要抱着循循善诱，与人为善的态度。如果在检讨时有下列这样的气氛，即所谓类似“杀气腾腾”“磨刀霍霍”“紧追敌人”的情景，那么被围攻的人，有的虽坦白暴露自己思想，但不免有牵强附会，把过去一切大小错误都硬归结到一个“主导思想根源”。连考试作弊也提高成为“落在地狱里的罪恶”。如果错误虽承认了，但这是因为免遭打击所承认的，不是从思想上认识到的，因而自己也不懂得，而且还增加了潜伏的反感。这样就失去了改造思想的意义，不能培养出坚持真理修正错误的优良品质，在思想上反增加了新的障碍。
    总之，我们认为，学生思想上的进步，主要的是开展新民主主义学习，加强学习政治课，培养自己有正确的为人民服务的观点。加强学习文化科学的课程，培养自己有为人民服务的基本知识。也只有加强各种课程，才能使自己在思想上提高一步。同学们，目前需要我们更好地学习。
