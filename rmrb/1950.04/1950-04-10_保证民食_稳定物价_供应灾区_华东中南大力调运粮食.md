　　Guarantee People's Food Supply, Stabilize Prices, Supply Disaster Areas
    East China and Central South Vigorously Transfer Grain
    [This newspaper report] Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The East China and Central South regions are vigorously transferring grain to solve the grain supply problem and stabilize financial prices. In addition to organizing the transfer of grain from the inland, East China is also vigorously receiving grain from other regions. The grain received by the region comes from Northeast China, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and Henan. At present, about 30% of the receiving task has been completed, part of which has been transported to Shanghai, and part of which has been transported to southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, Shandong, northern Anhui, southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and Nanjing. The inland transfer has reached 40% of the original plan. Some grain from northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, northern Anhui, and Shandong has been transported to Shanghai; some grain from southern Jiangsu and northern Anhui has been transported to Nanjing; and some grain from northern Anhui has been transported to southern Anhui. This work began in January this year, and was carried out jointly by local grain bureaus and grain companies. After the establishment of the East China Grain Transfer Headquarters at the end of February, it unified planning and led this work. In the past few months, grain transfer work has played a significant role in guaranteeing people's food supply, stabilizing prices, and supplying grain to disaster areas.
    The 5th Administrative Meeting of the Central South Military and Political Committee adopted a resolution on the transfer of trade grain. The decision pointed out: In December last year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council decided to allocate 1.5 billion jin of trade grain from the Central South region. This task has been specifically assigned to various provinces by the Central South Military and Political Committee. The allocation of this trade grain is to regulate the needs of markets in other regions and various provinces in Central South China, and to recover currency in a timely manner. This is an important measure to solve the relationship between grain supply and demand and stabilize financial prices. The grain transfer of this huge quantity is an unprecedentedly arduous task in history. The Central South Military and Political Committee specifically requires all provinces to complete 80% of the task by the end of April and the entire task by May.

　　保证民食  稳定物价  供应灾区
    华东中南大力调运粮食
    【本报讯】据新华社九日电：华东、中南两区正大力调运粮食以解决粮食供应问题，稳定金融物价。华东地区除组织内地粮食的调运外，并大力接运外区粮食。该区所接运的粮食来自东北、江西、湖南、四川和河南等地，目前已完成接运任务百分之三十左右，其中一部运至上海，一部则分运苏南、苏北、山东、皖北、皖南、浙江和南京等地。内地调运则已达到原计划的百分之四十，苏北、苏南、浙江、皖北和山东均有一部粮食运上海；苏南和皖北有一部粮食运南京；皖北有一部粮食运皖南。这一工作开始于今年一月间，当时由各地粮食局与粮食公司协同进行。二月底，华东区粮食调运指挥部成立后，即统一计划与领导进行这一工作。粮食调运工作数月来在保证民食、稳定物价以及供应灾区粮食方面，已经起了很大的作用。
    中南军政委员会第五次行政例会，通过了关于调运贸易粮的决定。决定指出：去年十二月中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会决定由中南区调拨贸易粮十五亿斤，此一任务业经中南军政委员会具体分配各省。此项贸易粮的调拨，是为了调剂外区及中南各省市场需要，并及时回笼货币。这是一个解决粮食供求关系，稳定金融物价的重要措施。这一巨大数字的粮食调运，为历史上空前的艰巨任务，中南军政委员会特责成各省必需在四月底完成百分之八十，五月份全部完成。
