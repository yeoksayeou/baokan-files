	Current Remittance Issues
	Xia Ming

	Remittances are an important source of foreign exchange for our country and a major economic source for the masses in the South China region. Before liberation, there were no precise statistics on the amount of remittances each year. According to general estimates: from approximately 1929 to 1941 before the Pacific War, the average annual remittance was about US$80 million to US$100 million. From 1942 to 1945, it was less, averaging only about US$40 million per year. After Japan's surrender and before liberation, the annual remittance figures fluctuated greatly, about US$130 million in 1946, US$80 million in 1947, and only US$66 million in 1948. In terms of the number of overseas Chinese, there is no accurate survey either. General estimates range from 8 million to 10 million, mostly in Southeast Asia, accounting for more than 95% of the total. Most of them are Fujianese working locally with limited economic power, so in terms of remittance amount, they only account for about 30% of the total. Most of the overseas Chinese residing in the Americas are Cantonese engaged in business locally, but in terms of remittance amount, they account for about 70% of the total.

	This huge foreign exchange resource, under the Kuomintang's unreasonable foreign exchange policy before liberation, resulted in: first, the vast majority of remittances went into the black market. For example, in 1947, the pseudo-Central Bank's total remittance income was only over 21 million yuan, and in 1948, it was 26 million yuan, accounting for only 26-44% of the total remittance amount. The rest mostly flowed into the black market, facilitating the acquisition of wealth by wealthy families and speculators, and was not controlled by the state. Second, the exchange rate was unreasonable, and coupled with inflation, overseas Chinese suffered too much loss when remitting at the official price. Third, in order to preserve value, the masses mostly kept foreign currency, creating a chaotic situation in the South China monetary market where foreign currency dominated.

	After liberation, the people's government adopted a truly rewarding policy for remittances. Under the principle of "public-private partnership, foreign exchange goes to the public, and benefits go to the private," various measures were formulated to facilitate remittances and take care of the families of overseas Chinese. For example, since liberation, Fujian and Guangdong provinces have successively promulgated measures for handling remittances, managing remittance agencies, and serving overseas Chinese. It is also stipulated that the Bank of China in various places is the agency for handling remittances. The Bank of China in various overseas Chinese areas also has overseas Chinese service departments to help the families of overseas Chinese solve difficulties. The main contents of these measures are the following five points:

	First, establish a reasonable exchange rate and adjust it dynamically at any time, with the principle of not letting overseas Chinese suffer losses: most remittances are family support remittances, so the exchange rate should be changed at any time according to the price situation. For example, according to statistics in Guangzhou from early January to early February, the closing price of the exchange rose from 2,930 (Hong Kong exchange rate) to 3,750, while the black market price was often about 5% lower than the closing price of the exchange, which effectively guaranteed the value of remittances. In addition, since the beginning of January, due to our unstable prices, preferential exchange rates for remittances have been set to distinguish them from general foreign exchange rates. The preferential price for remittances is uniformly calculated based on the highest exchange rate in the country. For example, in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and other places, the US exchange rate in late March was 41,000 yuan, while the price of remittances during the same period was 42,000 yuan, about 2-5% higher, to take care of the families of overseas Chinese. However, since April, prices have stabilized, and the exchange rate for remittances is not much different from the general exchange rate, and sometimes it is even lower than the general exchange rate when calculated based on purchasing power parity, so the national remittance price has been cancelled, and a unified exchange rate is used.

	Second, effectively protect the value of currency: In the past few days, under the condition of unstable prices, the following effective measures were taken to solve the problem of preserving the value of remittance funds:
	1. It is stipulated that letter agencies should remit remittances abroad in the original currency and should not arbitrarily convert them into RMB abroad to deceive overseas Chinese.
	2. After the original currency is remitted in, if the overseas Chinese do not use the funds immediately, they can be converted into original currency deposits or real-value deposits, and withdrawn at the current exchange rate as needed.
	3. If the families of overseas Chinese live in remote rural areas and it is inconvenient to withdraw money, original currency deposit slips for remittances are also issued. The families of overseas Chinese can withdraw RMB for use at the current exchange rate from nearby Bank of China or People's Bank or post office where there is no Bank of China at any time. This deposit slip has the regulations of being registered, fixed amount, limited area (payment in a certain area, such as the Chao-Mei area cannot be exchanged in the Si Yi area), and time limit (recalled after six months). If it is transferred, it needs to be endorsed by the Bank of China or the handling agency.

	Third, convenient and rapid disbursement: Strive for convenience in disbursement procedures. In areas with Bank of China, the Bank of China will disburse the money. People's Bank agencies at all levels and post office agencies in areas without Bank of China are entrusted to disburse on behalf of the bank. As early as January this year, the number of remittance disbursement agencies of the Bank of China in Fujian reached as many as 68. Efforts are also made to facilitate remittance methods. For example, the Bank of China in Singapore has established a fixed-term remittance method, in which the remitter pays on time abroad, and the paying bank in China pays on time, which is extremely convenient.

	Fourth, provide practical and thoughtful services for overseas Chinese: The Overseas Chinese Service Department of the Bank of China regularly publishes publications to report news from home and introduce news of domestic new democratic economic construction to overseas Chinese, and also helps the families of overseas Chinese introduce their children to schools, write letters, write and keep valuable item contracts, act as an agent for investment and rent collection, handle tickets and exit passports, guide going abroad and returning home, and set up overseas Chinese hostels to provide food and lodging for overseas Chinese in transit.

	Fifth, unite and manage the remittance agency industry: The existence of the remittance agency industry has its own social foundation. Some better letter agencies have a certain degree of trust among overseas Chinese in terms of credit, service spirit, and rapid disbursement, so they can be united to continue serving overseas Chinese and strive for remittances. However, in the past, under the Kuomintang's unreasonable foreign exchange policy, most letter agencies tended to operate in the black market. In the early days of liberation, on the one hand, the letter agencies did not understand our policies, and on the other hand, they were accustomed to operating in the black market. In addition, in our initial short period, the listed price was slightly lower, so there were still operators in the black market. Some foreign letter agencies did not comply with the regulations when remitting money abroad, arbitrarily converting it into RMB to exploit overseas Chinese, or arbitrarily accumulating and disbursing money, etc., all of which are subject to management.

	The current problems are: first, how to strengthen foreign propaganda: Overseas Chinese live abroad all year round and do not understand the true situation in China. In addition, the counter-propaganda of the reactionaries also makes overseas Chinese hesitate to invest and remit money back home. In the future, we should regularly introduce our new democratic policies to overseas Chinese, promote their consistent enthusiasm for loving the motherland, and help the motherland build. Second, foreign exchange controls in various countries are being strengthened, and the struggle for remittances will intensify in the future. For example, in December last year, the Philippines stipulated that remittances from overseas Chinese should not exceed US$50 per person per month, which is 2% of the past. Other places also have different degrees of restrictions, so how to unite letter agencies, water travelers, and strive for remittances through overseas Chinese leaders is an issue that should be studied. Third, the issue of material supply in overseas Chinese areas: The areas where families of overseas Chinese are concentrated in Guangdong and southern Fujian lack daily necessities such as grain and cloth. Due to the obstruction of transportation with the mainland and the difficulty of material transfer, in addition to using a part of the remittances to import necessities through trading companies to solve some of the difficulties, a comprehensive solution should also be studied.

　　目前侨汇问题
    夏鸣
    侨汇为我国外汇重要来源之一，也是华南一带群众主要经济来源之一，解放前侨汇数字每年均无精确统计，据一般估计：大约在一九二九年——一九四一年太平洋战争前，每年平均汇入约在美金八千万至一亿元之间，一九四二年——一九四五年则较少，每年平均不过四千万元左右，日本投降后至解放前每年汇入数字上落较大，一九四六年约一亿三千余万，一九四七年八千万，一九四八年仅六千六百万。就侨胞数量言，亦无确切调查，一般估计约在八百万至一千万之间，以南洋一带居多，约占全数九五％以上，其中多为闽人在当地作工者，经济力量较小，故就汇额言，只占全部汇额三○％左右。旅居美洲者大多为粤人在当地经商者，但就汇额言则占全部七○％左右。
    这样庞大的外汇资源，在解放前国民党不合理的外汇政策下，其结果是第一，侨汇绝大部分走入了黑市，如一九四七年全年伪中央银行收入侨汇仅二千一百余万元，一九四八年为二千六百万元，只占全部汇额二六—四四％，其余大部都流入了黑市，便利了豪门及投机家之套取，而并未为国家掌握，第二，汇率不合理，加上通货膨胀，侨胞按官价汇入，吃亏太大，第三，群众为保值起见，率皆保存外币外汇，造成了华南货币市场外币占统治地位的混乱局面。
    解放后，人民政府对侨汇的政策是采取了名符其实的奖励政策，在公私兼顾的“外汇归公利益归私”的原则下，制定了各种便利侨汇照顾侨眷的办法，如在闽粤两省自解放以来都先后颁布了处理侨汇办法，侨批业管理办法，华侨服务办法等。并规定各地中国银行为经办侨汇之机构，在侨区各地中国银行内又设有华侨服务部，帮助侨眷解决困难，这些办法的主要内容有下列五点：
    第一、订立合理汇率，随时机动调整，不使侨胞吃亏为原则：侨汇多属赡家汇款，故应随物价情况随时变动汇率，如广州自一月初旬至二月初旬统计，交易所收盘价由二九三○（港汇）提到三七五○，黑市价格则经常低于交易所收盘价五％左右，这就切实的保障了侨汇的币值，此外又自一月初开始由于我物价不甚稳定，又订有侨汇优待汇率，以别于一般外汇牌价，此优待侨汇之牌价即统一按全国最高地区之汇价计，如厦门，泉州等地美汇在三月下旬为四一、○○○元，同时期侨汇之价则为四二、○○○元，高出约二—五％，以资照顾侨眷。但自四月以来物价已臻稳定，侨汇汇价已与一般汇价无甚轩轾，且如按购买力平价计，有时尚低于一般汇价，故即取消全国侨汇牌价，而统一一个汇价。
    第二、切实保障币值：在前些日期，物价不很稳定条件下，曾采取下列有效措施，解决侨汇款项的保值问题
    １、规定信局在国外承汇侨汇应按原币，不应在国外任意折合人民币欺骗侨胞。
    ２、原币汇入后，如侨胞不立即用款可转做原币存款，或做折实存款，随用随按当日牌价支取。
    ３、如侨眷居在穷乡僻壤，支取不便，又发行了侨汇原币存单，侨眷可随时向附近中国银行或无中国银行处之人民银行或邮局，按当日牌价支取人民币应用。此存单有记名，定额，限区（一定地区支付，如潮梅区不能到四邑区兑付）限时（六个月到期收回）等规定，如经转让，需经中国银行或经办机构之背书。
    第三、解款便利迅速：在解款手续上力求方便，除有中国银行地区由中国银行解付外，并委托无中国银行地区之人民银行各级机构和邮政局机构代解，如福建中国银行早在今年一月份，解付侨汇机构即达六八处之多。在汇款方式上，亦力求方便，如新加坡中国银行订有约期汇款等办法，汇款人在国外按期交款，国内付款行按期付款，极为方便。
    第四、切实周到为侨胞服务：中国银行之华侨服务部经常出版刊物，向海外报导家乡消息及介绍国内新民主主义经济建设消息，并代侨眷介绍子弟入学，代写书信，代写保管贵重物品契约，代理投资收租，代办车船票及出口护照，指导出洋归乡，以及设立华侨招待所招待过境华侨食宿等。
    第五、团结及管理侨批业：侨汇业之存在，有其一定社会基础，某些较好信局在信用上，服务精神上，解款迅速上，在侨胞中有一定信任，故可以团结继续为侨胞服务，并争取侨汇。但在过去国民党不合理的外汇政策下，信局大多趋于黑市经营，解放初期，信局一方面不了解我之政策，一方面习于黑市经营，再加上我最初一短时期内牌价稍低，故尚有经营黑市者，还有部分国外信局不遵规定在国外汇款时，即任意折成人民币剥削侨胞，或任意积压解付等都在管理之列。
    现在的问题是第一，如何加强国外宣传问题：侨胞终年旅居海外，不明现在国内真象，加上反动派之反宣传，亦使侨胞回国投资及汇款有所顾虑，今后应经常向海外侨胞，介绍我新民主主义政策，发扬其一向热爱祖国之热忱，帮助祖国建设。第二、各国外汇管制加强，侨汇汇出的斗争，今后更要加剧，如去年十二月份，菲律滨规定限制华侨汇款每人每月不得超过五○美元，为过去之二％。其他各地亦有不同程度之限制，故应如何团结信局水客以及通过侨领争取侨汇是应研究之问题。第三、侨区物资供应问题：广东和闽南一带侨眷集中地区，粮布等日用必需物品向甚缺乏，因与内地交通梗阻，物资调运困难，现除以一部侨汇交由贸易公司进口必需品解决一部困难外，还应研究通盘解决办法。
