The ○9 fire alarm and ○0 police alarm telephone numbers in Beijing are related to the safety of the lives and property of all citizens of the capital. Some citizens do not sufficiently recognize the importance of these two telephone numbers and often dial them incorrectly or dial them for fun inadvertently. Some users even fail to prevent young children from using these numbers to dial randomly for fun. This causes many unnecessary troubles for the fire and public security authorities and also affects the calls of users who truly need them. Users who dial incorrectly mostly do so carelessly when dialing ○7 (time service) and ○8 (long distance telephone service). The Telecommunications Bureau is therefore calling on citizens to recognize the importance of these two numbers and to stop dialing them for fun or by mistake.

　　○九、○○号电话切勿错拨试拨
    京市○九号火警和○○号匪警电话关系首都全体市民生命和财产的安全，部分市民对这两个电话号码的重要性认识不够，时常不经意的拨错或试拨；甚至于有些用户不禁止幼童用这两个号码来随便拨着玩。使消防、治安机关徒增许多不必要的麻烦，也影响到真正需要用户的拨叫。拨错的用户多半是在拨○七（报时台）和○八（特快电话台）时不留神的缘故。电信局为此号召市民要认识到这两个号码的重要性，勿再试拨、错拨。
