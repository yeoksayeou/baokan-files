　　Unity of the Masses is Strength
    Remembering Communist Party Member Ma Zhengkun's Leadership in Production
    Shenyang Machinery Factory Party Committee Zhang Zhimin
    Comrade Ma Zhengkun is the planer team leader of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau in Shenyang. He is twenty-seven years old this year and has eleven years of service. In February of this year, the trade union recommended him to study in the staff and worker training class, which improved his class consciousness. After returning to the factory, he became active in production and was elected as the planer team leader (not directly participating in production). He honorably joined the Communist Party in June and received the Northeast Industrial Department's Second Class Hero award in October.

    When the factory was first liberated two years ago, the workers were all new arrivals from all over the country. They looked down on each other, were not united, and the eight people were divided into three small groups, unable to work together on anything, and their skills were not proficient. As a result, out of the twelve planing machines in the team, two or three would break down every day, and three or four workers would be idle every day. This made Old Ma, the team leader, quite worried. No matter how hard Old Ma worked alone, only 30 percent of the production task was completed in March and April of last year.

    In Red May, in order to promote the development of the competition, Old Ma worked even harder, working all day and secretly working overtime after work. However, he neglected the power of the masses and the scientific allocation of high and low skills and good and bad machines, resulting in only 60 percent of the production task being completed.

    Old Ma lay on the kang and couldn't sleep, thinking hard about the reasons for the failure. What could he do to complete or exceed the task? As a result, he came to a correct conclusion: The key is that if everyone is not mobilized, relying solely on oneself will not achieve much, even if one is exhausted to death.

    In June, Old Ma began to learn from past lessons, made a work plan, and decided to mobilize all the workers in the group to eliminate disunity. He used his spare time, adopted a family visit approach, or talked with workers during work breaks to understand what difficulties everyone had and tried to help solve the difficulties raised.

    Workers Li Wanqing and Mao Zongyi both had good skills, but they looked down on each other and were very at odds. Once, both Old Li and Old Mao wanted to use a jack (tool). Neither would give way, and they both wanted to use it first, resulting in the two men fighting each other. Old Li's head was injured, and Old Mao's shoulder was also broken. After the workers pulled them apart, both wanted to "go home and quit." Old Ma was not in the room at the time, but went to the factory management committee. When he came back and saw this situation, he took care of Li Wanqing at the clinic, letting him go home to rest; he found a good apprentice to help Mao Zongyi crank the handle. After work, Old Ma mobilized Wang Chonglian, who lived in the front and back yards with Old Li, to persuade Li Wanqing. Mao Zongyi had an apprentice to look after the bed, so he could free up his hands. Old Ma took this time to persuade Old Mao, saying, "Calm down, no matter what, we can't fight. Don't you know Old Li has a bad temper? You have a flexible mind, just turn a corner and it's over! Why don't you go to his house tonight and apologize? If we want to sum up our hatred, won't this team become more and more chaotic?" Old Mao said, "He hit me like this, and I'm going to apologize to him? I'm not going!" Old Ma said, "If two people are always right, it will never end. If you can go to his house and apologize, people's hearts are made of flesh, and it's not a disgrace!" Finally, Old Mao agreed. The next morning, just after starting work, Old Li and Old Mao came to Old Ma hand in hand, with smiles on their faces. Li Wanqing said, "Old Mao even came to my house yesterday to apologize! The main reason is that I have a bad temper that caused the fight."

    From then on, no matter when working, speaking, or using tools, they no longer saw the two of them bickering with each other.

    Worker Zhang Hongjie usually liked to be idle. One day, he took his child to the clinic to see a doctor. Old Ma saw him and went to his house the next day to see the child. Old Ma tried to help cure the child's illness and mobilized Old Zhang to work. Old Zhang said, "I know these things, but how can I rest assured to continue working?" Old Ma repeatedly explained to him, "You should find a way to treat your child's illness, but you can't not go to work!" Finally, he persuaded Old Zhang to go to work.

    In early August of last year, the factory implemented a cutting experiment, and the higher authorities mobilized preparations for this work. Old Ma began to study with the workers and repeatedly explained every morning and evening to dispel doubts such as "It's going to be terrible if we get a number!" "Do we have to record everything, even when we go to the toilet?" He began experimenting with new cutting speeds. When making a large tool holder, Zhang Hongjie said, "In the past, it took twenty points to make one. Now you want me to set it at nine points. Can I do it?" Old Ma encouraged him, saying, "Because you have excellent skills, you should set an example." As a result, Old Zhang made a large tool holder in nine minutes and nine seconds, setting a new record.

    In early September, the belt pulley was wet by the next month's rain, and everyone was afraid to change the belt, fearing the danger of the electricity running away. Worker Old Li said, "Let's find the repair department, otherwise I won't do it!" Old Ma thought that finding the repair department would take time to issue a ticket, and the bed car couldn't supply it. So, regardless of the danger, he came up and down to find a way and finally took down the wet belt. Old Li felt very sorry when he saw it and said, "You just put it there, I'll fix it!"

    In addition to using practical actions to unite workers and help solve difficulties, Old Ma also actively studied, reformed tools, and created new records. For example, in the past, tooth plates and tooth strips were made one by one. After his research, they were made in one piece and then cut into seven pieces. This not only saved the planer half the time and 40 percent of the material, but also saved a lot of work for sand turning and wood molds.

    Under his influence, five workers in the planing team created new records in September. For example, worker Li Wanqing, who used to like to fight, not only changed his temper but also created a new record for planing a bed, from twenty-eight points to fifteen minutes and five seconds. Mao Zongyi created a new record for planing the "bed center joint," from eight points to three points. Old Han, who didn't go to work when he was sick, planed a large tool holder more than twice as fast as before. Wen Rongkui, Zhou Jingfu, apprentice Wang Xiaogen, and others also successively created new records. In September, the team's production task exceeded 30 percent.

    However, Old Ma's active production and unity with the masses were resented by the bad element Yi Chungen. One day, Yi Chungen cut Old Ma's car tire five times. After investigation, the personnel department, based on the opinions of the masses, expelled Yi Chungen and sent him to the public security bureau for handling. At this time, Old Ma thought, "Now that my car has been damaged, will there be bad guys looking for trouble with me in the future?" After a ideological battle, he realized that this was a cowardly thought that a Communist Party member should not have. He thought, "The soldiers at the front are fighting hard and are so strong and brave despite the enemy's artillery fire. What is it to me to encounter this little setback? Not to mention a Communist Party member, even ordinary workers should not be discouraged by a little setback!" In this way, Old Ma continued to work tirelessly.

    At the Workers' Congress of the Machinery Bureau at the end of October last year, Old Ma won a five million yuan bonus. He thought, "The main reason I can win the award today is that everyone has contributed." So he took out some money to buy each of the twenty-two apprentices a pair of socks, a pencil, and a piece of soap. The rest of the money was lent to workers who had urgent needs. When his wife complained to him when he returned home, he said, "We won the award today, isn't it because of everyone's efforts! Buying some things makes everyone feel honored and promotes production a step further. We all have honor, isn't it much better than you buying a big cloth shirt?!"

　　团结群众有力量
    记共产党员马正坤领导生产
    沈阳机械工厂党委会  张智民
    马正坤同志是东北机械局沈阳第一机器厂刨工班长，今年二十七岁，工龄十一年。今年二月工会介绍他去职工训练班学习，提高了阶级觉悟。回厂后，生产积极起来，当选为刨工班长（不直接参加生产）。六月光荣参加了共产党，十月荣获东北工业部二等功臣奖励。
    前年刚解放时，工友都是新从四面八方来的，互相瞧不起，闹不团结，八个人就分成三小伙，啥事也整不到一块，技术也不熟练。因之，一班十二台刨床，一天就要坏两三台，每天还有三、四个歇工的。这样弄的老马这个班长当的实在有点发愁。不管老马一个人如何卖力气干，去年三、四月，只完成生产任务的百分之三十。
    红五月，老马为推动展开竞赛，自己干的更带劲，白天干一天，下班后还偷着加班，但忽略了群众的力量，及技术高低、机器好坏的科学配备，结果才完成生产任务的百分之六十。
    老马躺在炕上睡不着觉，一心思考失败的原因在那里？想什么办法才能完成或超过任务？结果得到一个正确的结论：关键在于：假如不把大家发动起来，光靠自己，就是累死，也起不了多大作用。
    六月，老马开始接受过去教训，订出了工作计划，决定把全组工友发动起来，消灭不团结现象。他就利用业余时间，采取家庭串门方式，或工作休息时间和工友们进行谈话，了解究竟大家有那些困难，并尽可能帮助解决提出的困难。
    李万庆和毛宗义两个工友，技术都较好，就是互相瞧不起，很不对头。一次老李和老毛都想使千金顶（工具），谁也不让谁，争着都要先使，结果两个人打在一块了。老李的头部被打伤，老毛的肩也被打破皮了，工友们拉开后，两个人都想“回家不干啦。”老马当时没在屋，开工厂管委会去了，他回来后看到这种情形，一面照顾李万庆到医务所上药，代替请假让他回家休息；一面找个好徒工，帮助毛宗义摇摇把。下班后，老马又动员了和老李住前后院的王崇连去劝李万庆。毛宗义有徒工给看床子，就能倒开手了。老马就利用这个时间劝老毛说：“消消气吧，不管怎的咱也不能打架。老李脾气不好，你还不知道吗？你脑筋挺灵活的，转个弯就完啦！是不是下晚你到他家给他陪个不是算啦！要总结仇，咱们这班不是越弄越乱了。”老毛说：“他把我打这样，我还给他陪不是，我不去！”老马说：“两个人要是都讲自己的理，就没完了，你要是能到他家去陪不是，人心都是肉长的，也不算低气呀！”最后老毛总算是答应了。第二天早晨刚上班，老李和老毛两个拉着手，面带笑容来找老马。李万庆说：“昨天老毛还到我家去道歉！主要还是我脾气不好才打起来的。”
    从此以后，不论干活、说话、使工具等等，再也看不见他俩互相闹蹩扭的现象了。
    工友张鸿洁平日很爱歇工。有一天他带小孩到医务所去看病；老马看见了，第二天就到他家去看孩子。老马一面想法子帮助给小孩治病，一面动员老张上班。老张说：“这些事我都知道，但叫我怎能放心干下去呢？”老马就反复向他解释说：“小孩有病应该想法子好好治，但也不能不上班啊！”终于说服了老张去上班了。
    去年八月初，工厂实行切削实验，上级动员准备这个工作。老马开始和工友们研究，并利用每天早晚时间反复解释，打消“弄出数来就够呛！”“拉屎撒尿也要记吗？”等怀疑。开始试验新的切削速度。作大刀架子时，张鸿洁说：“在从前干一个二十点，如今给我定九个点，我能干下来吗？”老马就鼓励他说：“因为你技术很好，应当起模范作用。”结果老张九点零九分作出一个大刀架子，创出了新纪录。
    九月初，下月浇湿了皮带轮，大家都不敢换皮带，怕电滚跑电危险。工友老李说：“找修理部吧，要不我不管！”老马一想找修理部要开票费时间，床车更供不上。于是他不顾危险，自己上来下去的想办法，终于把湿皮带拿下来。老李看见很不过意说：“你放那就行啦，我整吧！”
    老马除了用实际行动团结工友帮助解决困难外，自己还积极研究，改造工具，创新纪录。如以前作牙板牙条单根作，经他研究后，一块作出来，然后再切成七根。这样不但刨工节省二分之一时间、百分之四十材料，翻沙、木型也省了很多工。
    在他影响下，九月份刨工班有五名工友创出新纪录。如起初爱打架的李万庆工友，不但改了脾气，而且创出刨床身从过去二十八点作一个，提高到十五点零五分的新纪录。毛宗义创出刨“床身中接”从过去八个点提高到三点的新纪录。没病不上班的老韩，刨大刀架子比过去快二倍多。温荣魁、周景福、徒工王小根等都相继创出新纪录。九月份该班生产任务超过百分之三十。
    但是老马的积极生产和团结群众却遭到了坏分子伊春根的嫉恨。一天伊春根把老马的车子外带狠狠割了五刀。经查出后，人事科根据群众意见将伊春根开除，并送公安局处理。这时老马心里想：“这回把我车子割坏了，将来是否还有坏家伙再找我蹩扭呢？”经过了一场思想战斗，他认识了这是共产党员所不应有的退缩思想，他想着：“前方战士艰苦作战，冒着敌人炮火还那样坚强、勇敢，自己碰到这点小挫折算什么？不用说是共产党员，就是一般工人也不应当碰到一点挫折就泄气呀！”这样老马又一直不泄劲的干下去。
    去年十月末，在机械局工代大会上，老马荣获五百万奖金。他想：“我今天能得奖，主要是大家出力的结果”于是拿出一部分钱来给二十二个徒工每人买一双袜子，一支铅笔，一块胰子。其余的钱也全借给有急用的工友。回到家老婆瞒怨他时，他说：“咱们今天得奖，还不是大家的力气啊！买点东西叫大家光荣，把生产推动一步，咱们都有光荣，不比你买个大布衫强的多吗？！”
