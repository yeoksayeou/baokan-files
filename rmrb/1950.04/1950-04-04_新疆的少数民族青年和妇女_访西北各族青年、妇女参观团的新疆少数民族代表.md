Xinjiang's Minority Youth and Women

—A Visit to Xinjiang Minority Representatives of the Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Delegation

By our reporter Bai Sheng

How joyfully the youth and women of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang sing of liberation and freedom on this bountiful land beyond the Great Wall after liberation! Listen to the song of the Uyghur people praising liberation:

　　Little bird in the sky,
　　I hope you fly downward,
　　Take a message to Beijing for me,
　　To thank Chairman Mao.
　　………………
This song has also been brought to the people's capital.

The reporter recently had the opportunity to interview several Xinjiang minority youth and women representatives from the Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Delegation in the capital. "Two are the deputy leaders of the delegation—Uyghur youth representative Shadir and Tatar woman representative Roumanna, and the other two Uyghur youth representatives are Tursun and Tohuti Bahai. They are part of the representatives of youth and women from more than a dozen ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

They were selected to attend the first Northwest Student Congress, the third Northwest Youth Congress, and the first Northwest Women's Congress, which will soon be held in Xi'an, as representatives and preparatory workers. Taking advantage of the completion of the preparatory meeting and before the official congress is convened, they came to the people's capital to visit and exchange work experiences and opinions with the youth and women of the capital.

Tursun first introduced us to the history of the heroic struggle of the people of Xinjiang before and after liberation, especially the struggle of the youth in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan. Tursun looked calm and enthusiastic, with deep-set eyes and a high nose. He is only twenty-six years old, a chemistry teacher at Yili College in Xinjiang, deputy director of the Northwest Youth Federation Preparatory Committee, and a member of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League; among the youth in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan, he is a highly respected Uyghur youth with a history of heroic revolutionary struggle. In 1942, he was once arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Yili, but he always persisted in revolutionary activities.

Tursun spoke excitedly in Uyghur. Tohuti Bahai—a twenty-three-year-old Uyghur youth who speaks several languages—vividly translated for us with enthusiasm.

The three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan are located in northern Xinjiang, with a population of about one million. Historically, like other areas of Xinjiang, they have been continuously oppressed by the ruling classes of both the Manchu and Han nationalities since the rule of the Qing Dynasty.

In 1944, under the dark rule of Sheng Shicai and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan launched a heroic armed revolutionary struggle. They organized the National Liberation Army, first occupied Yining, and then quickly liberated the three districts of Yili, Ashan, and Tacheng. In 1947, the three districts declared themselves autonomous regions. It was not until September of last year, when all of Xinjiang was peacefully liberated, that the people of the three districts voluntarily abolished the name of the autonomous region. At this time, Xinjiang became a unified and completely new Xinjiang of the people.

After 1947, the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan became the revolutionary cradle for young men and women in Xinjiang. The Revolutionary Democratic Youth League was organized in the three districts, with 15,000 members. Various newspapers promoting revolution were published. Under the leadership of the League, the League's organ newspaper "Struggle" was published, the Kazakh youth published the "Revolutionary Upsurge" newspaper, and there were also progressive magazines such as "Forward Newspaper," "Revolutionary Youth," and "Literary Vanguard," and "Light." The Han Forward Youth also ran the "Democracy Newspaper," and the Naturalized (Russians who became Chinese citizens) people ran the "People's News," widely spreading the views of Marxism-Leninism and internationalism. Youth accounted for more than 80 percent of the cadres in various agencies in the three districts. In 1948, the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League was organized in the three districts. This was composed of progressive people and youth from various ethnic groups. The League members developed to 50,000. The purpose was to achieve true peace and democracy in Xinjiang. Because of the improvement of political consciousness, the general youth were extremely concerned about national affairs. They eagerly waited to read every message sent by Xinhua News Agency. When major cities in the interior were liberated, they held joyous celebrations, showing the Xinjiang youth's keen concern and support for the Liberation War. After the peaceful liberation of the entire province of Xinjiang, the people of the autonomous region held ten consecutive days of enthusiastic parades. The people of all ethnic groups expressed extreme love and concern for Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army. They also proposed to take practical actions to thank the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, thoroughly implement the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government, strengthen the mutual assistance and unity of the people of all ethnic groups, and work together under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government to build a new Xinjiang, a new Northwest, and a new China of the people.

Next, Shadir began to introduce us to the youth activities in the other seven administrative regions of Xinjiang before and after liberation under the rule of the Kuomintang. This twenty-five-year-old Uyghur youth, who had just graduated from the Mathematics Department of Xinjiang College, was full of enthusiasm in his speech. Before the liberation of Xinjiang, he was one of the leaders of the Democratic Youth League in Dihua City. After liberation, he joined the New Democratic Youth League and is currently a member of the Dihua City Working Committee of the Youth League, chairman of the Dihua City Student Federation, and deputy director of the Northwest Student Federation Preparatory Committee.

Shadir recounted happily:

Before liberation, there was also an organization of the Revolutionary Youth League in Dihua, which was composed of revolutionary youths of various ethnic minorities such as Uyghur, Tatar, Uzbek, and Kazakh, and some Han revolutionary youths. They also organized revolutionary groups such as "Combat Society" and "Vanguard Society." The Youth League also carried out underground activities in other regions, establishing branches and sub-branches. They carried out propaganda among general peasants and workers, so that the vast number of Xinjiang people could gain political awareness. Under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Youth League members carried out work in various combat ways until Xinjiang was peacefully liberated.

After liberation, the revolutionary Youth League members from all regions of Xinjiang victoriously joined forces, and at the same time, many of them joined or are applying to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. At present, the Youth League members are carrying out anti-spy, anti-despot, and anti-corruption movements in accordance with the Xinjiang Provincial Government's policy guidelines. The arduous and simple style of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Communist Party cadres stationed in Xinjiang has had a great influence on the Xinjiang youth, making the Xinjiang youth truly realize the correctness and greatness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries promoted the so-called "Pan-Turkism" among the people of Xinjiang. The youth who were poisoned by this thought have also gained awareness and publicly made self-criticism and reflection in the newspapers. These have repeatedly proved the correctness of the ethnic policies of the People's Government and the Communist Party and the great role they have played among the ethnic minorities. The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang made Xinjiang truly unified for the first time in history, and the ethnic issues have gradually been correctly and reasonably resolved.

Our conversation shifted from youth to women. Then, Roumanna, the deputy leader of the delegation, began to talk with me cordially. She is a daughter of the Tatar people from a poor background, an elementary school teacher, twenty-nine years old this year. Her father was innocently killed in prison by the reactionaries for "political crimes." She also suffered the pain of being abandoned by her husband in her personal life. But all this did not reduce her courage in life, but on the contrary, made her more determined in her fighting will. While raising two children, she also participated in social struggles. She participated in the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League. After the liberation of Xinjiang, she was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the New League and Minister of Propaganda of the Women's Department of the New League. In addition, she also served as the deputy director of the Northwest Women's Federation Preparatory Committee.

Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the oppression of the feudal system, Xinjiang women lived a painful life. The marriage system of most ethnic groups, such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Tatar, and Uzbek, was still a trading type, and polygamy was prevalent. Uyghur women married at the age of twelve or thirteen. In southern Xinjiang, women had to wear veils when they went out, otherwise they would be insulted. These were all kinds of unreasonable oppression brought to women by the feudal system.

The liberation of ethnic minority women in Xinjiang followed the same path as the liberation of ethnic minority youth in Xinjiang. When the people of the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan rose up in revolution, the women of the three districts also began to establish their own organizations—women's associations, absorbing a large number of women to participate in revolutionary work. Four hundred and sixty-five women became teachers in primary and secondary schools, and female students in primary schools reached 36,316. Female students accounted for more than 20 percent of middle school students.

In 1948, after the establishment of the New League, until the peaceful liberation of the entire region last year, women had gradually gained a position in society, and the organization of women's associations was merged into the Women's Department of the New League. At this time, the number of women members had increased to more than 10,000; the Women's Department also had sixteen women's technical classes and a women's nursery class. The Women's Department also clearly stipulated that women have two months of leave during the production period and are paid their salaries. In the three districts, women's special publications such as "Women's Voice" (Yili), "Women's Bi-Monthly" (Tacheng), and "Peace" (Ashan) were published. There were forty-eight women engaged in journalism in the three districts. A women's handicraft factory was established for poor women in Yili, and kindergartens were also established in Dihua and the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan. Illiteracy night schools were also established in winter and autumn.

The liberation of Xinjiang brought unlimited light and freedom to the ethnic minority youth and women in Xinjiang. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Xinjiang turned over for the first time in history. (Attached picture)

　　新疆的少数民族青年和妇女
    ——访西北各族青年、妇女参观团的新疆少数民族代表
    本报记者  柏生
    解放后的新疆各少数民族的青年、妇女们，他们在塞外这片丰饶的土地上，是多么欢欣地在歌唱着解放和自由！你听，那维吾尔族人民歌唱解放的歌声：
    天空中的小鸟儿，
    我希望你朝下飞，
    给我带信到北京，
    致谢毛主席。
    ………………
    这歌声又带到了人民的首都。
    记者最近有机会在首都访问了西北各族青年、妇女参观团中的几位新疆少数民族的青年和妇女代表。“有两位是参观团的副团长——维吾尔族青年代表沙迪尔和塔塔尔族妇女代表柔曼娜，另外两位维族青年代表吐尔逊、托胡提巴海。他们是新疆十余个少数民族青年、妇女代表中的一部分。
    他们都是被选派出席不久即将在西安召开的西北第一届学生代表大会、西北第三届青年代表大会和西北第一届妇女代表大会的代表和筹备工作者。这次趁大会筹备会开完，正式大会尚未召开前，来人民的首都参观，并和首都青年、妇女们交换工作上的经验和意见。
    吐尔逊首先给我们介绍了解放前后新疆人民英勇斗争的历史，特别介绍了伊犁、塔城、阿山三区青年的斗争情况。吐尔逊看起来沉静而热情，有着一对深陷的大眼睛和高鼻子。他今年才只有二十六岁，是新疆伊犁专科学校的化学教员、西北青年联合会筹委会的副主任、新疆保卫和平民主同盟盟员；在伊、塔、阿三区的青年中，他是一位很有威望的，有过英勇革命斗争历史的维族青年。一九四二年他在伊犁曾一度被国民党反动派逮捕，但他始终坚持着革命活动。
    吐尔逊用维语兴奋地讲着。托胡提巴海——一个才只有二十三岁的，会说数种语言的维族热情活泼的青年，生动地为我们翻译着。
    伊、塔、阿三区在新疆北部，人口约一百万左右，在历史上和新疆其他地区一样，从满清统治以来，不断遭受着满汉两族统治阶级的压迫。
    一九四四年伊、塔、阿三区人民在盛世才和国民党反动派的黑暗统治下，展开了英勇的武装革命斗争。他们组织了民族解放军，首先占领了伊宁，更迅速地解放了伊犁、阿山、塔城三区。一九四七年，三区宣布为自治区。一直到去年九月新疆全部和平解放，三区人民自动将自治区的名字取消，这时新疆便成为一个统一的崭新的人民的新疆了。
    一九四七年以后，伊、塔、阿三区便成为新疆青年男女们的革命摇篮。在三区组织了革命民主青年团，团员达到一万五千人，出版了各种宣扬革命的报纸，并在团的领导下出版了团的机关报《战斗》，哈萨克青年出版了《革命的热潮》报，此外还有《前进报》、《革命青年》和《文艺先锋》、《光芒》等进步杂志，汉族前进青年也办了《民主报》，归化族（入中国籍的俄罗斯人）人民办了《人民新闻》，广泛地传播了马列主义、国际主义的观点。三区各机关的干部中，青年占百分之八十以上。一九四八年，三区更组织了新疆保卫和平民主同盟，这是由各族的进步人士，青年组成的，盟员发展到五万，目的是在新疆实现真正的和平民主。一般青年因政治觉悟的提高，对国事都极其关心。他们热情地等待着读每一个由新华社发来的消息。当内地各大城市解放时，他们都欢天喜地的举行了庆祝会，表现了新疆青年对解放战争的热切关心和支援。当新疆全省和平解放后，自治区的人民曾连续举行了十天狂热游行。各族人民对毛主席和人民解放军都表现着极端的爱戴和关切。他们并提出要以实际行动来感谢中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民解放军，彻底实行中央人民政府的民族政策，加强各族人民的互助团结，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，共同为建设新的新疆、新西北和人民的新中国而努力。
    接着是沙迪尔开始为我们介绍新疆其他七个在国民党统治下的行政区解放前后青年活动的情况。这位新疆学院数学系刚毕业的二十五岁的维族青年，在谈话中充满着热情。新疆解放前，他是迪化市民主青年团领导者之一，解放后他加入了新民主主义青年团，现任青年团迪化市工作委员会委员、迪化市学联主席和西北学联筹委会副主任。
    沙迪尔愉快地叙述着：
    解放前在迪化也有革命青年团的组织，是维吾尔、塔塔尔、乌孜别克、哈萨克等少数民族的革命青年和一部分汉族革命青年所组成的。他们还组织了“战斗社”、“先锋社”等革命团体。青年团在其他各地区也同样进行地下活动，设立分会、支部，他们在一般农民、工人中间进行了宣传，使广大的新疆人民在政治上能得到觉悟。在国民党反动派统治的压迫下，青年团员用各种战斗的方式进行工作，直到新疆获得和平解放。
    解放后的新疆各地区的革命青年团员胜利会师了，同时他们中间很多人加入了或正在申请加入中国新民主主义青年团。目前青年团的团员们正按照新疆省政府施政方针，进行反特务、反恶霸、反贪污运动。驻在新疆的中国人民解放军和共产党的干部的坚苦诚朴的作风，对新疆青年起了很大的影响，使新疆青年真实的认识到中国共产党领导的正确和伟大。过去国民党反动派在新疆人民中宣传所谓“泛土耳其主义”，受着这种思想毒害的青年，也已得到了觉悟，并公开地在报纸上作自我批评和反省。这些，都一再的证明了人民政府和共产党的民族政策的正确和在少数民族中所起的伟大作用。新疆的和平解放，使新疆在历史上第一次真正统一起来，民族问题也逐步的得到了正确合理的解决。
    我们的谈话由青年又转到妇女方面来了。于是参观团副团长柔曼娜亲切地开始和我畅谈起来。这是一个贫苦出身的塔塔尔族人民的女儿，一个小学教员，今年二十九岁。父亲因“政治罪”无辜的被反动派杀害在狱中。她在个人的生活中又遭受了丈夫遗弃的痛苦。但这一切并没有减低了她生活的勇气，而且相反的使她更坚强了自己战斗的意志。他一面养育着两个孩子，同时还参加了社会斗争，她参加了新疆保卫和平民主同盟。新疆解放后，她被选为新盟中央委员兼新盟妇女部宣传部长，此外并担任了西北妇联筹委会的副主任。
    在国民党反动派统治下和封建制度的压迫下，新疆妇女过着痛苦的生活。大多数的民族如维吾尔、哈萨克、回族、塔塔尔、乌孜别克等民族的婚姻制度，还都是买卖式的，而且盛行一夫多妻制。维族妇女十二、三岁就结婚，在南疆妇女出去都要戴面罩，否则便会被侮辱，这都是封建制度带给妇女的种种不合理的压迫。
    新疆少数民族妇女的解放是与新疆少数民族青年的解放走着同样的道路。当伊、塔、阿三区人民起来革命后，三区妇女也开始成立了自己的组织——妇女会，吸收了大量的妇女参加革命工作。有四百六十五位妇女做了中小学的教员，入小学读书的女学生达三万六千三百一十六人，中学生中女学生占有百分之二十以上。
    一九四八年，新盟成立后，直到去年全疆和平解放，妇女已逐渐在社会上取得了地位，妇女会的组织归并到新盟妇女部中了。这时妇女会员已增加到一万人以上；在妇女部下更附设了十六个妇女技术班，和一个妇女保育班。在妇女部中更明确地规定了妇女在生产期间有两个月假期并照发薪金。在三区中并出刊了《妇女呼声》（伊犁）、《妇女半月刊》（塔城）、《和平》（阿山）等妇女专刊。三区妇女从事新闻工作的有四十八人。在伊犁并为穷苦妇女设立了一个女子手工厂，同时迪化以及伊、塔、阿三区也都设立了幼稚园，在冬秋两季更成立了文盲夜校。
    新疆的解放，给新疆的少数民族青年、妇女带来了无限的光明与自由，在人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，新疆人民第一次在历史上翻了身。（附图片）
