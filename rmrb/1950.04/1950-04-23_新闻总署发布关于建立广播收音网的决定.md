Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd – The Central People's Government News Administration has issued a decision on establishing a radio receiving network, the full text of which is as follows:

    Wireless broadcasting is one of the most powerful tools for mass publicity and education. In our country, where transportation is inconvenient, illiteracy is widespread, and newspapers are insufficient, its role is even more significant. Over the past year, the people's broadcasting事业 has developed rapidly. Many local authorities and military units have set up dedicated radio operators responsible for receiving and disseminating the content of the People's Broadcasting Station, which has achieved good results. In order to effectively and universally organize listening work, the following decisions are made:

    (1) All county and city people's governments that have not yet set up radio operators, except those located in central cities with large daily newspapers, should designate appropriate personnel within the government to serve concurrently as radio operators. Their task is to listen to or record news, government policies, and other important content broadcast by the central and local People's Broadcasting Stations, introduce and preview broadcast programs to the masses, and organize listeners to listen to important programs (such as speeches by government leaders, social science lectures, etc.). The full text of news and government policies and the key points of other important programs recorded by the radio operators shall be used by the county and city people's governments and county and city mass education centers to compile small newspapers and wall newspapers for distribution and posting within government agencies and among the people.

    (2) People's Liberation Army units that have not yet set up radio operators should designate appropriate personnel in political organs at all levels to serve as radio operators. Their tasks are the same as above. The full text of news and government policies and the key points of other important programs recorded by the radio operators shall be compiled by the political staff of the units into small newspapers and wall newspapers for distribution and posting among the troops and local residents.

    (3) All national agencies, organizations, factories, and schools should also consider setting up radio operators. Their task is to introduce and preview broadcast programs, organize personnel of agencies and organizations, factory workers, and school teachers and students to listen to important programs, record and post particularly important news, etc.

    (4) Active members of the audience may voluntarily apply to the radio station to become radio operators. Their task is to establish radio listening groups, publicize broadcast content to the masses, introduce the masses to listen to or participate in broadcasting, etc.

    (5) All radio operators should register with the local or central radio station and report their work progress and audience feedback on a monthly basis. Local and central radio stations should be responsible for guiding the work of radio operators, helping radio operators purchase, order, use, and repair radios and loudspeakers, helping radio operators subscribe to recording discs, and improving broadcast content according to the needs and opinions of the audience.

    无线电广播事业是群众性宣传教育的最有力的工具之一，在我国目前交通不便、文盲众多、报纸不足的条件下，作用更为重大。一年以来，人民广播事业已有迅速发展，许多地方机关和部队设立了专门收音员负责收听和传播人民广播电台的广播内容，获得了良好的效果。为了有效地普遍组织收听工作，兹决定如下：
    （一）全国各县市人民政府之尚未设置收音员者，除所在地为中心城市，出有大型日报者外，应一律指定政府内适当人员兼任收音员，其任务为收听或纪录中央和地方人民广播电台广播的新闻政令和其他重要内容，向群众介绍和预告广播节目，组织听众收听重要节目（如政府首长讲演、社会科学讲座等）。收音员所纪录的新闻政令全文和其他重要节目要点，应由县市人民政府和县市民众教育馆负责编写小报和墙报，在政府机关内和人民中发行和张贴。
    （二）人民解放军部队中之尚未设置收音员者，应在各级政治机关指定适当人员担任收音员，其任务同上项。收音员所纪录的新闻政令全文和其他重要节目要点应由部队政治工作人员编为小报和墙报，在部队和驻地居民中分发和张贴。
    （三）全国机关、团体、工厂、学校亦应酌量设置收音员，其任务为介绍和预告广播节目，组织机关团体人员、工厂职工、学校师生收听重要节目，纪录并张贴特别重要的新闻等。
    （四）听众中的积极分子得依自愿向广播电台声请为收音员，其任务为：成立收音小组，向群众宣传广播内容，介绍群众收听或参加播音等。
    （五）所有收音员均应向地方或中央广播电台登记，并按月报告工作情况和听众意见。各地方和中央广播电台应负责指导收音员的工作，帮助收音员购置、订制、使用、修理收音机和扩音器，帮助收音员订购留音机片，按照听众的需要和意见改进广播内容。
