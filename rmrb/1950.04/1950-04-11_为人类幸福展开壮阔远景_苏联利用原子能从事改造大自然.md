　　Unveiling a Magnificent Vision for Human Happiness
    The Soviet Union Uses Atomic Energy to Transform Nature
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th] According to a France-Presse report from Moscow on April 4th: The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's publication, "Bolshevik" magazine, recently published an essay by the renowned economist Khobinstai, discussing the Soviet Union's achievements and development in atomic energy research, stating: Unlike the United States, which uses atomic energy for military purposes, the Soviet Union uses it for economic construction. The article lists the magnificent prospects unfolded by the Soviet Union after mastering atomic energy, including: blasting away large mountains that hinder certain enterprises, opening up new lakes, changing river courses, digging wide canals, irrigating deserts to make them flourishing gardens, changing the climate of individual regions, fundamentally changing and mastering the technology of various production processes, discovering the greatest secrets in nature, such as the secret of changing inorganic matter into organic matter, and curing diseases that have always been considered incurable. Khobinstai declared: The Soviet state, having mastered the secrets of atomic energy, is now stronger than ever before. This event is not only of great significance for the further success of the Soviet Union, but also of particularly great significance for the entire course of future world history.

    苏联利用原子能从事改造大自然
    【新华社十日讯】据法新社莫斯科四日讯：苏联共产党中央机关刊物“布尔什维克”杂志最近一期刊载著名经济学家霍宾斯泰的论文，论述苏联研究原子能的成就与发展称：苏联不像美国那样把原子能用于军事目的，而把它用于经济建设的目的。文中列举苏联掌有原子能之后所展开的壮阔远景，包括：炸毁对某些企业有妨碍的大山，开辟新的湖泊，改变河道，开凿宽阔的运河，灌溉沙漠使成为欣欣向荣的花园，改变个别地区的气候，根本改变而且精通多种多样生产过程中的技术，发现自然界中最大的秘密，如改变无机体为有机体的秘密及医疗一向认为是不治之症的秘密等。霍宾斯泰宣称：苏维埃国家由于掌握了原子能的秘密，已经比以前任何时期更为强大，这一事件不仅对于苏联进一步成功有重大意义，而且对于未来世界历史的全部发展进程也具有特殊重大的意义。
