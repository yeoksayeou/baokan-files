Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Jessup, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large and one of the architects of the U.S. State Department's Asian aggression policy, delivered a lengthy radio address in Washington on the 13th, reporting on the results of his three-month fact-finding trip to the Far East. Jessup openly stated the U.S. government's intention to interfere in the affairs of the Asian people. He said, "What is happening in Asia is of extreme importance to the United States." Although he fabricated that Asia is important "because Soviet Communism obviously wants to seize the continent and colonize it," he had to admit, "Asia is important not only because Asia possesses huge material and human resources, but also because many great and promising things are happening there, because a great continent and a great people are eager to establish a free and prosperous society." Everyone knows that the U.S. government is trying to prevent the people of Asian countries from establishing a truly "free and prosperous society."

Jessup said that after investigating in Asia for three months, he "discovered" two "basic facts." One is the upsurge of national liberation wars in Asian countries. Jessup also said: There exists in Asian countries "the desire for independence, the awakening of national self-esteem, and the great force of tenacious resistance to foreign interference." Jessup said, "In most of the areas I visited, there is a very serious problem of violence. You cannot travel in these countries without realizing that you are in a war environment." "No matter where you are, you can always feel the impact of this." He helplessly described the massive scale of the people's liberation wars in South Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and Burma. For example, in Vietnam, when he traveled, he needed "several jeeps full of guards to escort him, with watchtowers and tanks lined up along the way." Another basic fact that Jessup discovered "is that the governments of Asian countries (referring to the puppet governments) are mostly relatively weak." Although Jessup boasted that "there are several experienced and responsible leaders in these countries," he had to admit that "there is often a big gap between these leaders and the people," and "the extreme poverty of the people and their growing dissatisfaction with the status quo are also weak points."

However, imperialists like Jessup cannot draw useful lessons from these basic facts. Jessup drew the inevitable conclusion based on the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Asia, believing that the "necessary central task" of these countries' weak "governments" "lies in public order, suppressing rebellions or civil wars." In order to support these "weak" "governments" to "suppress" the people's liberation wars in Asian countries, Jessup said that the actions the United States needs to take in Asia are: providing these "weak" reactionaries with military assistance and implementing the so-called "Point Four Program" to develop backward areas.

When talking about China, Jessup said resentfully: "Unfortunately, I have not been able to travel in that unfortunate country." Jessup explained the upsurge of national liberation movements in Asian countries with the unparalleled hatred of the Chinese people's victory that is unique to U.S. imperialists. He fabricated that this upsurge is due to some countries having "common borders" with the new China, or "the existence of a large number of Chinese minorities in Southeast Asia." Jessup's provocative fabrication is obviously stupid and ridiculous. Because without the aggression of U.S. imperialism and other imperialisms against Asian countries, and without their evil colonial system that has been established and intends to continue to maintain in Asian countries, then the people of Asian countries would not have engaged in national liberation struggles one after another.

The U.S. policy towards Asia announced by Jessup proves that the growing liberation struggle of the Asian people against U.S. imperialist aggression is by no means accidental. The main content of this aggressive policy is to pretend to be a "sponsor" of the independence, democracy, and freedom of the Asian people in order to achieve the purpose of deceiving and enslaving the Asian people. Jessup said: "The United States believes that every nation has the right to independence," but he immediately explained that the "independence" he was talking about is the "independence" like the Philippines and South Korea. Jessup calls this so-called "independence" of colonies the "right of every nation to solve its own problems in its own way." Jessup said: "The United States believes in the system of democratic government and encourages its realization wherever democratic government is possible, as we have done in Germany and Japan." This proves that the democratic government that U.S. imperialism wants to realize in Asia is to realize fascist puppet regimes like Adenauer and Yoshida. Jessup advocated continuing to provide military and economic assistance to the "free people" of Asia to "help them maintain their freedom." But Jessup immediately stated: This "freedom" is the kind of freedom that has been implemented in the Philippines and South Korea. Jessup also advocated continuing to provide economic assistance to the Kuomintang remnants in the form of loans and technical assistance.

However, even Jessup himself lacks confidence in this new U.S. aggression plan for Asia. Therefore, he put forward "two necessary conditions" for completing this plan, namely "resolutely moving forward in the face of many difficulties and setbacks that must occur" and "learning more about the actual situation of Asian life." But for the U.S. imperialists who have repeatedly suffered failures, Asia, where revolutionary flames are burning everywhere, seems to be forever difficult to understand.

### 亚洲到处正在燃烧着革命烽火  耶塞普招认侵略计谋发生困难  但仍要挣扎着支持摇摇欲坠的傀儡政权

　　亚洲到处正在燃烧着革命烽火
    耶塞普招认侵略计谋发生困难
    但仍要挣扎着支持摇摇欲坠的傀儡政权
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国无任所大使、美国国务院亚洲侵略政策制订人之一耶塞普，十三日在华盛顿发表冗长的广播演说，报告他三个月远东调查旅行的结果。耶塞普一开始就明目张胆地道出了美国政府要干涉亚洲人民事务的意图。他说：“亚洲正在发生的事情，对美国具有极端的重要性”。他虽然捏造一句亚洲之所以重要是“因为苏维埃共产主义显然要夺取大陆并使之殖民地化”，但他不能不接着承认：“亚洲之所以重要，不但因为亚洲拥有巨大的物资与人力资源，亚洲之所以重要，也是因为许多巨大而且有希望的事正在那里发生，因为一个伟大的大陆和伟大的人民，正急于要建立一个自由而富裕的社会”。尽人皆知，美国政府正力图阻止亚洲各国人民建立真正“自由而富裕的社会”。
    耶塞普说：他在亚洲调查了三个月，才“发现”了两个“基本事实”。一个是亚洲各国人民解放战争的高涨。耶塞普又说：亚洲各国存在着“独立的愿望、民族自尊心的觉醒和对外来干涉的顽强抵抗的巨力”。耶塞普说：“在我访问的多数区域中，都有一个很严重的暴力问题。你不会在这些国家中旅行，而不察觉到你是处身在一个战争环境中。”“不论你在何处，你总能感觉这事的影响。”他无可奈何地叙述了南朝鲜、越南、马来亚、菲律宾与缅甸等地的人民解放战争的巨大规模。例如在越南，他在旅行时，就需要“若干吉普车满载卫兵护送，沿途排列着了望塔与坦克”。耶塞普发现的另一个基本事实，“就是亚洲国家的政府（按指傀儡政府），大多是相对地孱弱的。”耶塞普虽然扬言“这些国家中都有若干有经验而负责的领袖”，但不能不接着就承认：这些“领袖与人民之间，往往有个大鸿沟”，而“人民极端贫困与他们对生活现状日益不满，也是薄弱点”。
    但是，美帝国主义分子如像耶塞普之流不可能从这些基本事实得到有益的教训。耶塞普根据美帝国主义对亚洲的侵略政策而引伸出必然的结论，认为这些国家的孱弱的“政府”的“必要的中心工作是在于公共秩序、扑灭叛乱或内战”。为了支持这些“孱弱”的“政府”“扑灭”亚洲各国的人民解放战争，耶塞普说，美国需要在亚洲采取的行动是：给予这些“孱弱”的反动派以军事援助，并实行所谓开发落后区的“第四点计划”。
    耶塞普在说到中国时，悻悻地说：“不幸得很，我未曾能够在那个不幸的国家旅行”。耶塞普以美帝国主义者所特有的对中国人民胜利的无比愤恨，来解释亚洲各国民族解放运动的高涨。他虚构这一高涨是由于有些国家与新中国有“共同的边界”，或者“东南亚存在有众多的中国少数民族”。耶塞普这种挑拨性的捏造，显然是愚蠢可笑的。因为如果没有美帝国主义及其他帝国主义对亚洲各国的侵略，如果没有它们在亚洲各国已经建立并企图继续保持罪恶的殖民地制度，那末，亚洲各国人民就不会如此前仆后继地进行民族解放斗争了。
    耶塞普所宣布的美国对亚洲的政策，正说明亚洲人民日益增长的反对美帝国主义侵略的解放斗争完全不是偶然的。这一侵略政策的主要内容便是，伪装亚洲人民独立、民主、自由的“赞助者”，来达到其欺骗和奴役亚洲人民的目的。耶塞普说：“美国相信每一民族都有独立的权利”，但是他随即解释了他所说的“独立”，乃是菲律宾、南朝鲜那样的“独立”。这种殖民地之所谓的“独立”，耶塞普称为每一民族“按照其自己的方式解决其自己问题的权利”。耶塞普说：“美国信仰民主政府的制度，并在任何可能实现民主政府的地方都鼓励其实现，我们已在德国和日本这样做了。”这里证明美帝国主义所要在亚洲实现的民主政府，就是要实现阿登纳和吉田那样的法西斯傀儡政权。耶塞普力主继续以军事和经济援助给予亚洲的“自由人民”，以“帮助他们保持自由”。但是耶塞普随即声明：这种“自由”，乃是在菲律宾、南朝鲜已实行的那种自由。耶塞普还主张继续用贷款与技术协助的形式给予国民党残匪等以经济援助。
    但是，甚至连耶塞普自己也对美国这种新的亚洲侵略计划缺乏信心。因此，他提出了完成这一计划的“两个必要条件”，即“在许多一定要发生的困难和挫折面前，坚决前进”；并“对亚洲生活的实际情形，多多了解”。但是对于屡遭失败的美帝国主义者来说，到处燃烧着革命烽火的亚洲似乎是永远难于了解的。
