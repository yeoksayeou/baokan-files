Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 27th: Shanghai's total tax revenue target for March was exceeded as scheduled. The total tax paid in the city in March reached over 580.1 billion yuan, which is 116% of the original target. Most taxes exceeded their targets, with only seven items, including tobacco and superstitious items in commodity tax, falling short.

The main reason why Shanghai's total tax revenue target was exceeded this time was the result of the strengthened tax collection work by tax officials at all levels. For example, when collecting income tax from profit-making enterprises, the method of "democratic appraisal" was initially adopted for some small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, which gradually reduced tax evasion. As a result, income tax revenue from profit-making enterprises in March exceeded the target by 121.6%. Strict implementation of the regulations on stamping capital account books also resulted in actual stamp tax revenue exceeding the original target by 291.7%. In terms of commodity tax, categories such as food and beverages, daily necessities, industrial products, cosmetics, agricultural and forestry products, and mineral products all exceeded their predetermined targets because they were collected in accordance with the newly promulgated "Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax" by the Government Administration Council. Due to stable prices in March and an increase in deposits in banks, income tax from deposit interest also exceeded the original target by 166.7%.

　　上海上月税收如期超额完成
    【新华社上海二十七日电】上海市三月份税收总任务如期超额完成。三月份全市实缴税款共达五千八百零一亿余元，这原定任务百分之十六。其中各种税收大都超额完成任务，未完成的只有货物税的烟类、迷信品等七个项目。
    上海市这次税收总任务所以能超额完成，主要是各级税务工作人员加强了稽征工作的结果。如在征收营利事业所得税时，对部分中小型工商业初步采取“民主评议”的方式，使逃税现象逐渐减少，因而三月份营利事业所得税收入即超过任务百分之一二一点六。严格执行资本账簿贴印花的规定，也使印花税实收超额完成原定任务的百分之二九一点七。在货物税方面的饮食品类、日用品类、工业品类、化妆品类、农林产品类、矿产品类等，因依照政务院新颁的《货物税暂行条例》征收，也都超过了预定任务。由于三月份物价稳定，行庄存款增加，存款利息所得税也超额完成原定任务的百分之一六六点七。
