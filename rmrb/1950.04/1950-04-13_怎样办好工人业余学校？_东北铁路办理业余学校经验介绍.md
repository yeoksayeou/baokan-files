　　How to Run Workers' Spare-Time Schools Well?
　　——Introducing the Experience of Northeast Railway in Running Spare-Time Schools
　　China Railway Trade Union National Committee
　　It has been four months since the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions started running workers' spare-time cultural literacy schools. The following points are worth introducing:
　　1. Based on the principle of voluntarism, mobilizing workers to consciously participate in learning and implementing the policy of everyone running the school is the best way to consolidate spare-time learning and overcome the initial difficulties of spare-time schools. When mobilizing workers to enroll, some educated workers to recognize the pain of illiteracy, such as the Qiqihar Railway Bureau's coal platform workers and the Harbin Railway Factory organizing illiteracy complaint meetings, and Suihua's staging of the short play "Learn Culture," all of which were very effective. Some used labor models or responsible cadres to take the lead in enrolling, such as the old hero Chen Zhijiu, the Zhang Zhongye of the 884 hero locomotive, the female hero Dong Yulan, Liu Jimin, the director of the Organization Department of the Northeast Railway General Bureau's directly affiliated Party Committee, and Wang Xuezeng, the vice chairman of the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions, who took the lead in participating in learning, which drove many workers. Experience has shown that as long as workers voluntarily participate in learning, the difficulties of spare-time schools can be easily overcome. For example, the Suiling Spare-Time School had no school buildings, so the workers organized themselves and built three houses through voluntary labor, solving the problem of school buildings. After the Zhangwu Spare-Time School was established, the workers of the engineering section made blackboards themselves, the workers of the telecommunications section borrowed light bulbs, and a student borrowed a stove, and everyone put together a chimney, quickly completing the teaching equipment.
　　2. The cadres responsible for organizing spare-time education must take the initiative to find ways and take the initiative to seek cooperation and help from all parties in order to overcome the difficulties in running spare-time schools. For example, the Minister of Culture and Education of the Qiqihar Sub-Federation of Trade Unions often actively consulted with the administration, the CCP branch, and the Communist Youth League to rationally and uniformly allocate workers' spare time, solving the major difficulty of "not having time to study." Conversely, some cadres do not mobilize workers, and when they encounter difficulties, they do not think of solutions, but rely solely on external forces, either shouting that there is no time to study or blaming all parties for not providing enough help, resulting in poorly run spare-time schools.
　　3. Use contracts to improve teaching efficiency. At present, there are three types of learning contracts signed between employees of the Northeast Railway: The first type is a contract signed between students and teachers to guarantee good learning and good teaching; the second type is a contract signed between the Qiqihar Spare-Time School and the administrative heads of the students' units, with the school guaranteeing to teach students to an average score of 70 or higher, and the administrative heads guaranteeing that meetings and overtime work will not affect students' attendance; the third type is a learning assistance contract between students, such as the assistance contract signed between stokers and drivers, and between young workers and older workers in the Harbin Railway Bureau. These contracts have a great effect and are planned to be widely promoted.
　　4. Summarize the experiences of spare-time schools and literacy classes in a timely manner, establish a reward system using champion circulating banners, attendance charts, and other methods, and use selected learning models to promote learning. After the Harbin Sub-Federation of Trade Unions held a learning model conference in February this year, it greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm, and the number of spare-time schools increased from 22 to 47, the number of literacy classes increased from 60 to 266, and the number of enrolled students increased from 7,891 to 12,998.
　　5. Adopt appropriate learning organizational forms according to different local conditions. The railway is a scattered point and line, with many production departments and day and night work, and the work and rest times are not uniform. Therefore, diverse organizational forms must be used. Even for regular spare-time schools, the set of ordinary schools cannot be rigidly applied. We believe that regularization means having a certain organization, a certain school system, fixed students and fixed teachers, a regular examination system, and conducting teaching in a planned and step-by-step manner under the policy of focusing on improving culture. At present, the spare-time schools for railway employees in various parts of Northeast China can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is regional spare-time schools, which are led by school committees composed of people from various units, with more classes, including primary, advanced, and middle school classes. This type of school allows students to enter suitable classes according to their existing level of education, and they can make faster progress in learning. However, due to the large number of production departments, students are prone to mobility, and there is a need for dedicated full-time academic affairs directors to be responsible, which can only be done in key areas at present. The second type is spare-time schools in independent large production units, such as those established in factories and large stations. The advantage of this type of spare-time school is that it is combined with the production situation of the unit, which is convenient for leadership to grasp, and there may be fewer classes. The third type is spare-time schools with centralized leadership and decentralized teaching, such as the current spare-time school in the Jilin Engineering Section. The school headquarters is located in the section's location, with branch schools on each line, and the work areas form classes. Each branch school and learning class are centrally led by the school headquarters, with unified plans, unified teaching materials, unified progress, and unified examinations, while teaching is decentralized. This organizational form solves the difficulty of workers living in scattered locations, solves the difficulty of inconsistent working hours, and unifies the progress of literacy class teaching, so that scattered literacy classes gradually move towards a regular school system. This organizational form is worth advocating and promoting in departments where centralized teaching is not possible.

　　怎样办好工人业余学校？
    ——东北铁路办理业余学校经验介绍
    中国铁路工会全国委员会
    东北铁路总工会办理工人业余文化补习学校已经四个月了，有下面几点值得介绍：
    一、根据自愿原则，发动工人自觉地参加学习，贯彻大家办学校的方针，是巩固业余学习，克服业余学校初创困难的最好方法。发动工人入学时，有的是启发工人认识不认字的痛苦，如齐齐哈尔局煤台工与哈尔滨铁路工厂组织文盲诉苦会，绥化编演“学文化”短剧，都收效很大。有的以劳动模范或负责干部来带头入学，如老英雄陈志久、八八四号英雄机车的张忠业、女英雄董玉兰、东北铁路总局直属党委组织部长刘济民、东北铁路总工会副主席王学增等同志首先参加学习，带动了许多工人。经验证明，只要工人自愿参加学习，业余学校的困难就容易克服。如绥棱业余学校没有校舍，工人们自己组织起来，以义务劳动盖好三间房子，解决了校舍困难。彰武业余学校成立后，工务段学员自己动手制黑板，电务段学员借灯泡，一位学员借来炉子，大家凑烟筒，很快就办齐了教学设备。
    二、负责组织业余教育的干部，要主动地想办法，主动地找各方面配合帮助，才能克服办理业余学校中的困难。如齐齐哈尔分总工会文教部长，经常主动地找行政、中共支部和青年团商讨，合理地统一地分配了工人的业余时间，解决了“没有时间学习”的大困难。相反的，有些干部不去发动工人，遇到困难也不想法解决，一味依赖外力，不是空喊没有学习时间，就怪各方面帮助不够，结果业余学校就办不好。
    三、以订合同的方式来提高教学效率。目前，东北铁路员工间订立的学习合同已有三种：第一种是学生与教员订立的保证学好教好的合同；第二种是齐齐哈尔业余学校与学生本单位的行政首长订立的合同，学校保证把学生普遍教到七十分以上的成绩，行政首长保证不因开会、加班影响学生缺席；第三种是学生之间的学习互助合同，如哈尔滨铁路局司炉与司机、青年工人与老年工人间订立的互助合同。这几种合同的作用都很大，准备普遍推广。
    四、及时总结业余学校和识字班的经验，用优胜循环旗，出席升降表等方式，建立奖励制度，用选出的学习模范来推动学习。哈尔滨分总工会今年二月召开了学习模范大会后，大大鼓励了学习情绪，业余学校由二十二个增加到四十七个，识字班由六十个增加到二六六个，入校学员由七、八九一名增加到一二、九九八名。
    五、根据各地不同情况，采用合适的学习组织形式。铁路是分散的点与线，生产部门繁多，昼夜工作，作息时间不统一。因此必须用多样的组织形式。即使是正规业余学校，也不能硬搬普通学校的一套。我们以为正规化就是有一定的组织、一定的学制、固定的学生和固定的教员，有定期的考试制度，在以提高文化为主的方针下，有计划有步骤地进行教学。目前，东北各地铁路员工的业余学校，大致可以分成三种类型：第一种是地区性的业余学校，由各单位派人组成校委会领导，班次较多，有初级、高级、中学班。这样类型的学校，可使学员根据已有文化程度进入适宜的班次，学习起来进步较快。但由于生产部门多，学生容易流动，需要有专门脱离生产的教务主任等负专责，目前还只能有重点地举办。第二种是独立大生产单位的业余学校，像工厂、大站段所建立的。这种业余学校的好处，是与该单位生产情况结合，便于领导掌握，可能班次少一点。第三种是集中领导、分散教学的业余学校，如吉林工务段现在的业余学校，校部设在段的所在地，各线设分校，工区组成班。各分校与学习班由校部集中领导，统一计划，统一教材，统一进度，统一考试，而分散教学。这种组织形式解决了工人居住分散的困难，解决了工作时间不一致的困难，统一了识字班教学的进度，使分散的识字班逐渐走向正规的学制。这种组织形式，在不能集中教学的部门是值得提倡推广的。
