Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th—The South China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Guangdong Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Guangdong Provincial People's Government jointly issued a letter to compatriots on Hainan Island. The full text is as follows:

Dear Compatriots on Hainan Island!

With the liberation of the mainland of the entire province, the remaining enemy is trapped on Hainan. Our mighty Liberation Army is determined to eliminate this enemy. Now, the vanguard troops have defeated the enemy's desperate resistance and landed victoriously on Hainan Island. The complete liberation of Hainan Island is about to arrive. We extend our greatest joy to you and our heartfelt condolences for your more than twenty years of unyielding struggle.

Since the Great Revolution, the people of Hainan Island and their armed forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have fought continuously for the cause of people's liberation through the Agrarian Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War. Under the enemy's layers of blockade and far from the main force, despite repeated devastation by the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism, they have never slackened their fighting will. Especially in the past three and a half years, in order to cooperate with the national liberation war, they have advanced wave upon wave, fearless of sacrifice, smashed countless enemy "encirclements" and "sweeps," established large liberated areas and tens of thousands of armed forces, and created favorable conditions for responding to the army's cross-sea operation this year and finally eliminating the remnants of the Chiang bandits. These achievements are forever admired by the people of the whole country.

Compatriots on Hainan Island! Your heroic and long-term struggle has now reached the final moment of victory. Chiang Kai-shek's dream of relying on the vast sea as a shield for his life has been completely shattered in our victorious crossing of the sea. Facts have proved that the People's Liberation Army can not only cross the natural barriers of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River to liberate the entire Chinese mainland, but also cross the wide ocean, overcome滔天 waves, and liberate any island at sea. Now the flag of the People's Liberation Army has been flying on the beaches of Hainan. Our powerful main force of the Liberation Army will follow closely behind the vanguard troops to continue landing and sweep away the remnant soldiers and defeated generals of the Chiang bandits. The liberation of Hainan Island is imminent, and the liberation of the entire province of Guangdong will finally be completed.

At the final moment when Hainan Island is facing complete liberation, we call on all compatriots on Hainan Island to quickly mobilize, carry forward the spirit of struggle of the past twenty years, and bravely cooperate with the army's actions:

First, the people's armed forces on Hainan Island must closely cooperate with the field army that has landed. In addition to assisting in combat and helping the field army to understand the enemy's situation, geography, and other information, it is also necessary to organize armed activities in a wide area to prevent the enemy from escaping from the battlefield in order to gather and annihilate them, and to surround and capture the fleeing bandit troops at any time to prevent them from turning into bandits, infiltrating the countryside and continuing to disrupt public security and undermine the people's cause.

Second, with the exception of a few diehard elements of the Chiang bandit officers and soldiers who are willing to be enemies of the people and must be resolutely eliminated, all those who are determined to repent and sincerely surrender to the people, regardless of their rank, should be guaranteed the safety of their lives after disarming them, and their personal belongings should not be confiscated or killed. They should be sent to the People's Government or the Liberation Army for resettlement.

Third, all patriotic people on Hainan Island must organize the protection of mines, factories, warehouses, transportation, cities, rural areas, and other construction and materials in a planned way, strictly prevent destructive destruction by the Chiang bandits after military failure, and arrest and punish all criminals who dare to infringe upon the people's property.

Fourth, all public and private factories, shops, and public utilities must continue to operate and produce with peace of mind, and must not stop work without reason. Farmers should actively carry out spring plowing. The ownership of all cultivated land will not be changed before the implementation of land reform. The crops are guaranteed to be harvested by whoever sows them, and others must not encroach on them.

Fifth, the people of Hainan Island should, like the people of Guangdong mainland, give full support to the supply of food, firewood, and other combat materials for the army's cross-sea operations. All combat requisitioned materials shall be allowed to be offset against public grain and taxes.

Compatriots on Hainan Island! The complete liberation of Hainan Island is about to arrive immediately. Let us bravely greet this victory and make it quickly realized!

We shout:

Welcome the battle to liberate Hainan, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits!

Give full support to the front line, expand the victory of the landing, and quickly liberate Hainan!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

　　中共中央华南分局、广东军区和人民政府
    发表告海南岛同胞书
    号召配合大军歼灭匪军保护国家财产
    【新华社广州二十日电】中共中央华南分局、中国人民解放军广东军区、广东省人民政府联合发表告海南岛同胞书。全文如下：亲爱的海南岛同胞们！
    全省大陆解放，残敌困守海南，我雄壮的解放大军坚决消灭该敌，现在先头部队已击溃敌人的绝望抵抗，在海南岛胜利登陆了。海南岛的彻底解放，马上就要到来了。我们谨以最大的欢欣向你们祝贺，并对你们二十余年的不屈斗争，致以亲切的慰问。
    自大革命至今，海南岛的人民及其人民武装，在中国共产党领导之下，经过土地革命、抗日战争、人民解放战争，不间断地为人民解放事业而奋斗，在敌人的层层的封锁与远离主力的情况下，虽经国民党与日本帝国主义的反复摧残，从未松懈过斗争意志；尤其近三年半来，为配合全国解放战争，更加前仆后继，奋不顾身，粉碎了敌人无数次的“清剿”、“扫荡”，建立了大块解放区与数万武装队伍，创造了今年呼应大军渡海作战、最后肃清蒋匪残余的有利条件。这些功绩，是永远为全国人民所景仰的。
    海南岛同胞们！你们的英勇的、长期的斗争，现在已到了最后胜利的时候了。蒋匪企图依托汪洋大海作其护命屏障的梦想，已在我渡海胜利中完全粉碎。事实证明，人民解放军不但能横渡黄河、长江的天险，解放全部中国大陆，并且能够跨越宽阔海洋，克服滔天波浪，解放任何海上的岛屿。现在人民解放军的旗帜业已飘扬于海南滩头，我强大解放军主力将紧随其先头部队之后，继续登陆，扫清蒋匪残兵败将，海南岛的解放顷刻可至，广东全省解放，也将最后完成了。
    在海南岛已面临彻底解放的最后关头，我们号召全海南岛同胞，迅速动员起来，发扬你们过去二十余年的斗争精神，勇敢配合大军行动：
    第一，海南岛的人民武装部队，要和登陆的野战军取得密切配合，除了必须协助作战、帮助野战军去了解敌情、地理和其他情况以外，还须在广大地区上组织武装活动，阻止敌人从战场上逃脱，以便聚集歼灭，并随时围困与捕捉溃散匪军，防止其化成土匪，渗入农村继续扰乱治安、破坏人民事业。
    第二，蒋匪官兵，除少数首恶分子甘心与人民为敌者必须坚决予以消灭以外，凡决心悔悟、诚意投向人民者，不论其官阶大小，各界人民应于解除其武装之后，一律保障其生命安全，其随身财物不加没收，不加杀害，就近送交人民政府或解放军收容。
    第三，所有海南岛的爱国人民，要有计划地组织对矿山、工厂、仓库、交通、城市、农村及其他建设和物资的保护，严防蒋匪于军事失败后的毁灭性的破坏，逮捕与惩处各个敢于侵犯人民财产的罪犯。
    第四，所有公私工厂、商店、公用企业，要继续开工营业，安心生产，不得无故停工。农民要积极进行春耕，一切耕地的所有权在未实行土地改革以前不加变动，作物保证谁种谁收，他人不得侵夺。
    第五、大军渡海作战之粮食、柴草及其他作战物资的补给，海南岛人民要与广东大陆人民一致，给以全力的支援。所有作战征用物资，一律准予在公粮及税收项下抵缴。
    海南岛同胞们！海南岛的彻底解放立即就要到来了，让我们勇敢地迎接这一胜利，并使之迅速实现吧！
    我们高呼：
    迎接解放海南战斗，彻底、全部、干净消灭蒋匪残余！
    全力支援前线，扩大登陆胜利，迅速解放海南！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
          中共中央华南分局
          中国人民解放军广东军区
          广东省人民政府
            四月十六日
