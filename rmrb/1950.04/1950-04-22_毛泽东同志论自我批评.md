Comrade Mao Zedong on Self-Criticism

　　We have said that a house should be swept regularly; if it is not swept, it will be covered with dust. A face should be washed regularly; if it is not washed, it will be covered with dust. The thoughts of our comrades and the work of our Party will also accumulate dust and should be swept and washed. "Running water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot," because they resist the erosion of microorganisms or other organisms through constant movement. For us, regularly reviewing our work, promoting a democratic style in these reviews, not fearing criticism and self-criticism, and practicing the beneficial maxims of the Chinese people such as "Say all you know and say it without reservation," "The speaker is not to blame, but the listener should take warning," and "Correct mistakes if you have committed them, and guard against them if you have not," are the only effective ways to resist errors and shortcomings, these political microorganisms, from eroding the thoughts of our comrades and the body of our Party. The rectification movement, with the aim of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient," has been so effective precisely because we have unfolded correct rather than distorted, serious rather than perfunctory, criticism and self-criticism in this movement. The Chinese Communists, with the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is entirely just, are ready to sacrifice everything personal, and are always ready to give their lives for our cause. Do we still have any thoughts, viewpoints, opinions, or methods that are erroneous and unsuitable to the needs of the people that we are reluctant to discard? Do we still welcome any political dust or political microorganisms to stain our clean faces and erode our healthy bodies? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making each of us who are alive feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests, errors, or shortcomings that we cannot sacrifice? (On Coalition Government, April 1945)

　　Our border region's production, whether in the peasant masses, government institutions, schools, the army, or factories, has achieved great results. There has also been great progress in the relationship between the army and the people. The face of the border region is very different from what it used to be. All of these are manifestations of our comrades' deepened understanding of the mass viewpoint and a great step forward in integrating with the masses. However, we should not be complacent. We must continue to engage in self-criticism and continue to seek progress. If there is dust on our faces, we should wash them every day. If there is dust on the ground, we should sweep it every day. Although we have fundamentally overcome the tendency of bureaucratism in our local work and the tendency of warlordism in our military work, these bad tendencies can still grow again. We are surrounded by layers of Japanese imperialism and Chinese reactionary forces. We are surrounded by the scattered petty bourgeoisie. Extremely foul bureaucratic dust and warlordist dust are pouring onto our faces in large quantities every day. Therefore, we must never become complacent and self-satisfied at the sight of achievements. We should restrain complacency and constantly criticize our own shortcomings, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day for the sake of cleanliness and to remove dust. (Get Organized!, November 1943)

　　Finally, in our opposition to subjectivism, sectarianism, and stereotyped Party writing, there are two principles that must be noted: The first is "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones," and the second is "cure the sickness to save the patient." Past mistakes must be exposed without any consideration of personal feelings. We must analyze and criticize the bad things of the past with a scientific attitude so that future work will be more cautious and better done. This is the meaning of "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones." However, the purpose of our exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings is entirely to save people, just like a doctor treating an illness, not to diagnose a person to death. If someone develops appendicitis, the doctor removes it, and the person is saved. Anyone who makes mistakes, no matter how big their mistakes are, as long as they do not conceal their illness and refuse treatment, do not stubbornly cling to their mistakes to the point of being incurable, but are honest and truly willing to be treated and corrected, we should welcome them in order to cure their problems and turn them into good comrades. It is definitely not possible to solve problems by being momentarily happy and giving a chaotic beating. We must not adopt a reckless attitude towards ideological and political problems. We must adopt the attitude of "curing the sickness to save the patient," which is the correct and effective method. (Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing, February 1942)

　　毛泽东同志论自我批评
    我们曾经说过，房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘。脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会发生灰尘的，也应该打扫与洗涤。“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”，是说它们在不停的运动中抵抗了微生物或其他生物的侵蚀。对于我们，经常地检讨工作，在检讨中推广民主作风，不惧怕批评与自我批评，实行“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”这些中国人民的有益的格言，正是抵抗错误、缺点这类政治微生物侵蚀我们同志的思想与我们党的肌体的唯一有效的方法。以“惩前毖后，治病救人”为宗旨的整风运动之所以发生了很大的效力，就是因为我们在这个运动中展开了正确的而不是歪曲的、认真的而不是敷衍的批评与自我批评。以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有什么错误的不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘、政治的微生物来点污我们的清洁的面貌与侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？（《论联合政府》，一九四五年四月）
    我们边区的生产，无论在农民群众方面、机关学校方面、军队方面、工厂方面，都得到了很大的成绩，在军民关系上也有了很大的进步，边区的面目，和以前大不相同，所有这些，都是我们的同志对于群众观点已经加深，对于结合群众大进一步的表现。但是我们不应该自满，我们还要继续作自我批评，还要继续求进步。我们脸上有灰尘，就要天天洗脸，地上有灰尘，就要天天扫地。尽管我们在地方工作中的官僚主义倾向，在军队工作中的军阀主义倾向，已经根本上克服了，但是这些恶劣倾向又可以生长起来的。我们是处在日本帝国主义与中国反动势力的层层包围之中，我们是处在散漫的小资产阶级的包围之中，极端恶浊的官僚主义灰尘与军阀主义灰尘天天都向我们的脸上大批地扑来。因此，我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来，我们应该抑制自满，时时批判自己的缺点，好像我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。（《组织起来》，一九四三年十一月）
    最后，我们反对主观主义、宗派主义、党八股，有两条宗旨，是必须注意的：第一是“惩前毖后”，第二是“治病救人”。对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去坏的东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些，这就是“惩前毖后”的意思。但是我们揭发错误、批评缺点的目的，好像医生治病一样，完全是为救人，而不是为了把人诊死。一个人发了盲肠炎，医生把他割了，这个人就救出来了。任何犯错误的人，也不管他的错误犯了多大，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，以便把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。决不是痛快一时，乱打一顿，所能解决问题的。思想上的毛病与政治上的毛病，决不能采取鲁莽态度，必须采用“治病救人”的态度，才是正确有效的方法。  （《整顿学风党风文风》，一九四二年二月）
