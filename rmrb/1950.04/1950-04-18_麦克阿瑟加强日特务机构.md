Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 17th: According to MacArthur's orders, the Japanese Yoshida government has appointed Japanese Prosecutor-General Ueda as the head of the secret police agency. This organization is currently being formed as part of the American "Counter Intelligence Corps" (CIC). Among the main officials of this new Japanese secret police agency are personnel from the former Japanese "Counter Intelligence" organization, who until recently were working at MacArthur headquarters, serving as "advisors" to the American espionage agencies in the Far East. The new Japanese secret police agency will receive a large number of work plans from the American "Counter Intelligence Corps" related to anti-labor movement, anti-communism, and anti-peace movement activities. The American occupation authorities have transferred many political files to the Japanese government, including lists of democratic civil servants and individuals suspected of "anti-Japanese activities." The Americans have appointed liaison officers from the American espionage agencies and appointed advisors to supervise the activities of American agents within the Japanese secret police. Ueda's police agency has also obtained the files that the Americans received from the former Japanese espionage agencies after the war. The Japanese secret police agency will currently be divided into three groups: political, military, and "counter-espionage." Police personnel will be directed by MacArthur headquarters personnel through representatives of the American espionage agencies.
