　　A Paradise for Children of Ethnic Minorities
    ——Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Takeover of the Mongolian and Tibetan School
    Chen Zhicun
    April 4th of this year marks the first anniversary of the National Mongolian and Tibetan School being taken over by the People's Government. In this short year, significant changes have taken place in all aspects.

    During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Mongolian and Tibetan School had more than 500 students. After the liberation of Beijing, due to some students voluntarily participating in the construction of Inner Mongolia, there are now only over 190 students. Among them, excluding eight students from the Tibetan, Manchu, and Miao ethnic groups, the rest are all Mongolian students. Although there were so many students in the past, there were no proper housing facilities. At that time, Dormitory No. 12, although a very small bungalow, was crammed with six double beds. When students on the upper bunks sat up, they would touch the ceiling. The students ate in tents. When it was windy, the tables were covered with dust; when it rained, there was mud everywhere underfoot.

    Kuomintang members, Three Youth League members, and sycophantic students were constantly creating trouble and undermining the unity of the students. They tried to provoke the Mongolian students into two irreconcilable opposing groups. I remember one night, a Kuomintang student suddenly yelled wildly: "Students from Eastern Mongolia, get up quickly, students from Western Mongolia are attacking us!" As a result, the Eastern Mongolian students gathered in the yard, dismantling tables and chairs, picking up stones, making a lot of noise, and preparing to fight. Finally, two Western Mongolian students risked their lives to come out and make peace. They said: "We are all Mongolians, what hatred could we have? Let's unite!" After the storm passed, it was found that this was caused by a few people fighting; later they still looked for opportunities to create incidents.

    During the Kuomintang rule, although the school was called the Mongolian and Tibetan School, it never paid attention to the culture of the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. Taking Mongolian language as an example, every semester they only learned the basics, and after two or three years, they still hadn't mastered it.

    In the past, there was one thing that seemed to "value" the customs and habits of ethnic minorities: every year on March 29th, they would "expand the celebration," saying that this day was the "Great Day of Commemoration of Genghis Khan, the Great Yuan Emperor." To celebrate, they started preparations a month in advance, some donating money outside the school, some rehearsing plays… As a result, very few attended classes. It was a joke, to "expand the celebration" they wasted a month of the students' learning time.

    If a few dishonest students went out and fought or committed violence, they would not be educated and corrected when they returned to school. Instead, they would be comforted by saying, "It's nothing, our border nationalities are just like that!" Is that really what our ethnic minorities are like? The principal even brazenly sang about how he had always used this kind of "education of love" in his years of running the school.

    The school was destroyed under this kind of "education of love": a few people gambled, went out of school to stroll the streets at will, scolded teachers, beat teachers, didn't pay at restaurants, embezzled money, no one cared when students got sick, students had no books for class, let alone any library, microscope, physics and chemistry experiment equipment, etc. This is the true face of the "education of love" that the principal sang about at the time. This is the educational policy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang towards ethnic minorities!

    However, the People's Government takeover on April 4th last year brought infinite light and happiness to the Mongolian and Tibetan School! In this short year, the Mongolian and Tibetan School has been completely transformed.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, all nationalities are as close as brothers and sisters. The dilapidated houses that originally had no glass have now become neat school buildings with sparkling glass. There is a library with enough books to read. The students' food, clothing, textbooks, stationery, etc., are all provided by the government. Microscopes and physics and chemistry experiment equipment have also been added. The school clinic also has considerable medical equipment and medicines.

    The students no longer deliberately violate school rules. Everyone is respecting teachers and studying diligently and actively on a voluntary basis. Every day when the library door opens, many students fill the seats. When the seats are full, they stand and read magazines and newspapers.

    The culture of our ethnic minorities has been valued. Still taking Mongolian language as an example, now the students have not only mastered the new alphabet, but can also generally read articles. In order to increase the students' opportunities to learn Mongolian and Tibetan languages, the school has cancelled English this semester. Now everyone is actively and earnestly learning their own languages and scripts. The school has also held Mongolian language speech contests and Mongolian language wall newspapers. To encourage them, prizes were also awarded.

    The current Mongolian and Tibetan School has become a paradise for children of ethnic minorities! The students are all firmly under the banner of Mao Zedong, intensifying their studies, improving their cultural level, and preparing to return to build a new Inner Mongolia and a new Tibet in the future.

　　少数民族子弟的乐园
    ——庆祝蒙藏学校接管一周年
    陈芝村
    今年四月四日，是国立蒙藏学校为人民政府接管的一周年。在这短短的一年过程中，各方面都起了显著的变化。
    蒙藏学校在国民党反动派统治时期，共有五百余同学。北京解放后，由于一部同学自愿参加了内蒙建设工作，现在只有一百九十多同学。其中除去八个藏、满、苗各族同学外，其余均为蒙族同学。过去的同学虽然那样多，但是没有房舍。当时第十二宿舍，虽然是一个很小的平房，还硬挤进六个双人床。住在上层的同学，当坐起时，便与天棚接触。同学们都在帐蓬里吃饭。遇到刮风天，饭桌上便充满了一层尘土；遇到下雨天，脚下一片稀泥。
    国民党员、三青团员和拍马吹牛的流氓学生们，随时都在挑皮捣蛋和破坏同学们的团结。硬把蒙族同学挑拨成两个难于调和的对立集团。记得一天夜里，一个国民党员学生突然狂叫：“东蒙同学快起来，西蒙同学打我们了！”结果，东蒙同学都聚集在院里，拆桌椅，捡石头，吵吵闹闹，准备打架。最后，有两位西蒙同学冒着危险出来讲和，他们说：“我们都是蒙古人，难道有什么恨吗？团结起来吧！”风波过后，才知道这是由于几个人打架引起的；后来他们仍然互相寻隙，制造事故。
    国民党统治时，学校虽然名为蒙藏学校，但从不注意蒙藏民族的文化。拿蒙文来说，每学期都是学字头，学两、三年，仍没弄清。
    过去有一件事从表面上看来好像是在“重视”少数民族的风俗习惯：每逢三月二十九日“扩大庆祝”，说这天是“伟大的元太祖成吉思汗纪念日”。为了庆祝，在前一个月就开始筹备，有的到校外捐钱，有的在排剧……于是上课的就极少了。真是笑话，为了“扩大庆祝”却浪费了同学们一个月的学习时间。
    少数不老实的同学们出去如果打架行凶，回校后不但不对其教育改正，反而安慰他们说：“没什么，我们边疆民族就这样！”难道我们少数民族就是如此吗？校长还厚颜地唱着什么：我办了这些年教育一向是用这种“爱的教育”。
    学校就在这种“爱的教育”下被摧毁了：少数人赌博、随便出校逛大街、骂先生、打先生、吃饭馆不给钱、贪污、同学得病无人管，学生上课没书，更谈不到什么图书馆、显微镜、理化实验器等设备了。这就是当时校长所唱的“爱的教育”的真象。这就是蒋介石匪帮对少数民族的教育政策！
    但是，去年四月四日人民政府接管后给蒙藏学校带来了无限的光明与幸福！在这短短的一年中间，却使蒙藏学校变得焕然一新。
    共产党领导下的各民族像亲兄弟姐妹一样亲热。原来没有玻璃的破乱房屋，现在已变为整齐而有晶莹玻璃的校舍。有了图书馆，其中有足够看的书籍。同学们的衣食与课本文具等等都由政府供给。又添设了显微镜与理化实验器等设备。校医室也有了相当的医疗器材和药品。
    同学们再也不故意违犯校规了。大家都在自觉自愿的基础上，尊敬师长与认真积极地学习着。每天图书馆门一开，许多同学就挤满了座位。座位满员时，便站着看杂志报纸。
    我们少数民族的文化受重视了。还是拿蒙文来说，现在同学们不但弄清了新文字字母，且一般都能读文章。学校当局为了增加同学们的学习蒙藏文的机会，在这学期取消了英文。现在都积极认真地学习着自己的语言文字。学校还举办过蒙语讲演会，蒙文壁报。为了鼓励，还发给了奖品。
    现在的蒙藏学校，它已成为少数民族子弟的乐园了！同学们都坚定地在毛泽东的旗帜下加紧学习，提高自己的文化水平，准备将来回去建设新内蒙与新西藏。
