　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty Defends World Peace
    Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor Sends Letter Congratulating the General Confederation of Trade Unions of China and the Soviet Union
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 29th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has received a letter from the Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor to our General Confederation of Trade Unions and the Soviet General Confederation of Trade Unions, congratulating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as follows: At the time of the signing of this extremely important Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor respectfully extends to you our most sincere greetings, and kindly requests you to convey to the Government of the Soviet Socialist Republics and the Government of the People's Republic of China the warmest congratulations of the Vietnamese working class.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty defends world peace and consolidates and develops the victory of the world revolutionary movement recently achieved in China. The working class and people of Vietnam are convinced that, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class and people will victoriously and rapidly build a new China. The great Soviet Union and the new China are the main forces of the world's peace and democracy camp, and will frustrate the sinister schemes of all reactionary imperialist warmongers.
    Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance!
    Long live the Soviet Socialist Republics!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Marshal Stalin!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
        Chairman Viet Hoang Trung
        General Secretary Xuan Thanh Duong
