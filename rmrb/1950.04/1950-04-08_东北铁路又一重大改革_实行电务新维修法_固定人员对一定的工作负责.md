　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. The Northeast Railway Bureau has decided to implement a new electrical maintenance method throughout the Northeast Railway. This is another major reform in electrical work, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. When implementing this new maintenance method, all electrical personnel will be divided into three groups: inspection, repair, and construction. The inspection group will regularly inspect electrical facilities within its jurisdiction and perform minor repairs to maintain the standardized operation of various electrical facilities. The repair group will be further divided into signaling, motor, and line groups, generally performing periodic "medium repairs" on various facilities. The construction group will specialize in new projects and temporary tasks or projects occurring in various sections, supervisor areas, or work areas. Before construction, the construction group will sign repair contracts with each section, and both parties will fulfill their responsibilities according to the contract. After the project is completed, it will be inspected and evaluated. If the construction group saves materials and reduces the original budget expenditure during the project, it can also obtain a certain percentage of the reward. Therefore, this can not only implement cost accounting, but also improve project quality.
　　In the past, in railway electrical work, whether it was signaling, lines, or machinery, people were sent to repair wherever a failure occurred. There were no fixed personnel responsible for specific tasks, and there were no fixed work standards. The new maintenance method completely eliminates these shortcomings of past work. This new maintenance method is essentially the maintenance responsibility system for electrical work. At the same time, to implement this responsibility system, it is necessary to strengthen the planning and scientific division of labor in electrical maintenance work, so that all work can be carried out in a reasonable, planned, and step-by-step manner, using manpower according to the technical operation process table implemented by the Soviet Union.
　　In addition, the Bureau has also decided to implement a responsibility system for the utilization of telegraph and telephone business circuits. This responsibility system, due to its clear division of labor and fixed responsibilities, not only increases the number of notifications and calls but also strengthens the protection of machinery.

　　东北铁路又一重大改革
    实行电务新维修法
    固定人员对一定的工作负责
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北铁路局决定在东北全路实行电务新维修法，这是东北铁路学习苏联先进经验在电务工作上的又一重大改革。实行这种新维修法时，所有的电务人员将分为包检、包修、包工组三个部分：包检组除按时巡检管内电气施设物外，并随时进行小的补修，以维持各种电气施设物的经常标准化。包修组中又分为号志、电机、线路三组，工作一般地是进行各种施设物的定期“中修”。包工组则专做新的工程和各段、监工区或工区发生之临时任务或工程。包工组在施工前与各段签订包修合同，双方按合同规定履行职责，工程完竣后，经过检查，作出评定。工程中如包工组节省了材料而减少了原预算的支出时，还可以取得一定比例的报酬。因此，这不仅能贯彻成本核算，而且可以提高工程质量。
    过去，在铁路电务工作上，不管是号志、线路或机械，总是那里发生了故障就派人到那里修理。没有固定的人员对一定的工作负责，也没有一定的工作标准。新维修法则完全消除了过去工作上的这些缺点。这种新维修法实际上就是电务工作的检修负责制。同时，为了贯彻这种负责制，就必须加强电务检修工作的计划性和科学分工，使全部工作按照苏联实行的技术作业过程表，合理地有计划有步骤地运用人力进行工作。
    此外，该局还决定实行电报、电话业务回线运用负责制，这种负责制由于分工明确、责任固定，不仅提高通报通话数量，且可加强对机械的保护。
