　　After-School Production Preparations Completed
    Beijing Middle Schools Begin Planting
    Municipal Schools Production Committee Organizes Inspection and Guidance Work Groups to Strengthen Leadership
    [Our Newspaper] The seventy middle schools in Beijing participating in after-school agricultural production have mostly established specific production plans and have completed preparations to enter the planting phase. The seventy schools have been allocated a total of 1,198 mu of land; of these, 37 schools have received loans equivalent to 84,600 jin of millet, resolving the issue of production funds. In formulating the plans, due to the varying degrees of understanding of this work among the schools, the following different performances and results emerged:

    First, the issue of learning from farmers and technical workers: Schools that did well resolved the questions of what to plant and how to plant. For example, when Beijing Normal University initially drafted its plan, some suggested planting watermelons and large head cabbages; and using 200 jin of potato seeds per mu. After talking with farmers, they learned that watermelons are difficult to grow; the planting season for large head cabbages had passed, with the second planting season being in the autumn; and only 130 jin of potato seeds are needed per mu. Hebei High School learned from farmers that Chinese cabbage can be planted in stages every few days to avoid the phenomenon of having too much to eat at times and no vegetables to eat at other times. Xinhua Middle School even established close relationships with farmers, exchanging labor and borrowing farm tools, solving the issues of technology and tools. Therefore, these schools are full of confidence and dare to make appropriate investments in the land allocated to them. Some other schools, however, failed to do this and lacked confidence in managing even the best garden land; they lacked long-term plans and wanted to switch to planting dry land crops. Still others were afraid of losing money and invested very little.

    Second, the issue of technical mutual aid and cooperation in purchasing tools: Among the eight schools in the fifth group (Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Duzhi, Xiehua, Muzhen, Xin Sheng No. 1 Hospital, Lida, Songyun, Beining Midwifery), some schools with little land did not need to hire a technical worker, so they hired several together. They also bought tools together, which was more economical than buying them separately. However, some schools, even though their land was very close to each other, insisted on buying separately, even digging their own wells, resulting in overly large budget investment amounts. Neighboring schools should pay attention to the sharing of wells, farm tools, etc.

    Third, the organization and use of labor: Most schools adopted a combination of labor exchange and collective labor. For example, students at Hebei High School exchanged labor with four workers. The workers were regularly in the fields, and the students took their original jobs. When a large amount of labor was needed, the students took turns exchanging labor, and they recorded the nature of the work and the working hours in detail. This solved some of the production technology problems and better guaranteed learning.

    Fourth, the coordination of production and learning: Huiwen Middle School appropriately advanced the teaching of seed germination and growth processes, pest prevention methods in biology class, soil and climate in geography class, and the relationship between the hardness and softness of water and plants in chemistry class, so that production and learning were combined and became the best tools for practical teaching. North China Middle School and other schools also have similar plans.

    The arrangements for production time in each school are as follows: one is for schools close to the land, such as Beijing Normal University, where each class has one production time per week, all scheduled in the afternoon, with lessons scheduled on other days; one is for schools far from the land, where teachers have implemented a full-time system, such as North China Middle School, where each class has one full day of production time per week, with lessons evenly distributed over the other five days; and the other is for private middle schools that are far from the land and where teachers are part-time, making it more difficult to schedule classes, so some lessons are scheduled on other days, and the rest are made up on Saturday afternoons or Sundays, ensuring that the teaching plan is completed. Students who do not participate in production must still stay at school to study when others go to production. However, some schools failed to grasp this point, resulting in a disguised holiday for students who did not participate in production.

    Fifth, the method of deducting long-term investments (such as waterwheels, livestock, wells, etc.): Only a few schools deduct them in installments according to the depreciation method, and most schools have not yet clearly stipulated this. Some schools stipulate that they should be deducted in full within this year. A production committee member of a certain school once told the students: Don't expect to eat unwanted vegetables this year, and cheap vegetables can't be eaten either. Otherwise, there will be no way to deduct the costs. This erroneous deduction method will seriously affect the students' enthusiasm for production.

    In addition, some individual schools do not proceed from reality and set the amount of investment too high. For example, a certain school that was only allocated five mu of land also wants to dig a well, buy livestock, a waterwheel, and an iron plow. Some schools plan to buy fertilizer for the next year now. These are inappropriate. What is even more erroneous is that some individual schools have not yet completed their preparations and have not even gone to the land once. The Production Committee has not held meetings to study work for a long time since its establishment, or there is insufficient democracy, so that the production enthusiasm of the vast number of students has not been mobilized. This phenomenon of neglecting and passively treating this work should be overcome quickly.

    Based on the above situation, the Beijing Municipal Schools Production Committee has separately encouraged the schools that have done well and instructed the schools where deviations have occurred to correct them immediately. In order to further strengthen understanding of the situation and provide guidance at any time, the Production Committee has recently formed an inspection and guidance work group.

　　课余生产准备工作完成
    京市各中学开始播种       
    市学校生产委员会组织检查指导工作组加强领导
    【本报讯】京市参加课余农业生产的七十个中等学校，绝大部分已订出具体的生产计划，并已完成准备工作进入播种阶段。七十个学校共分得土地一千一百九十八亩；其中三十七校已领到相当于八万四千六百斤小米的贷款，解决了生产资金问题。在订计划中，由于各校对这一工作认识程度不同，也就有下列不同的表现和结果：
    第一、向农民和技术工人学习的问题：作的好的学校解决了种什么和怎样种的问题。如北京师范在初步拟订计划时，曾有人提出种西瓜和大头菜；马铃薯在每亩地里下二百斤种子。与农民谈话后，知道西瓜不好种；大头菜播种期已过，第二季的播种期是秋天；马铃薯的种子每亩地只需一百三十斤。河北高中从农民那里学到：小白菜可以分期隔几天种一次，以避免有时吃不了和有时没菜吃的现象。新华中学更与农民建立了密切的关系，与农民拨工，并借得农具，解决了技术和工具问题。因此，这些学校都充满了信心，敢于在分得的土地上作适当的投资。另有少数学校由于没有作到这一点，便对最好的园地也缺乏经营的信心；不作长期打算，想改种旱庄稼。还有的学校怕赔本，投资的极少。
    第二、在技术上的互助与购买工具方面的合作问题：第五大组的八个学校（女一中、笃志、协化、慕贞、新生一院、立达、嵩云、北宁助产）中，有的学校地少没有必要聘一个技术工人，大家就合起来聘几个。工具也合伙买。这比单独买一套节省。但有的学校，两校的地离得很近也要单独买，甚至单独打井，以致预算的投资额订得过分庞大。邻近学校的水井、农具等调剂使用是应注意到的。
    第三、劳动力的组织与使用：多数学校都采用了变工与集体劳动相结合的办法。如河北高中的同学与四位工友变工，工友经常在地里，他们原来的工作由同学代替；需要大量劳力时，同学轮流拨工。并详细地记载工作性质与工时。这样解决了部分生产技术问题，且能更好地保证学习。
    第四、生产与学习的配合：汇文中学把生物课的种子发芽生长过程、虫害预防方法，地理课的土壤和气候，化学课的水的软硬性质与植物的关系等，都适当地提前讲授，使生产与学习结合，成为实物教学的最好的工具。华北中学等校也有同样的计划。
    各校生产时间的安排有下列三种办法：一种是离地较近的如北京师范，每班每周有一次生产时间，都排在下午，功课排在其他各日；一种是离地较远，教员已实行专任制的如华北中学，每班每周有一整日生产时间，功课匀在其他五天里去；另一种是离地远、教员又是兼任的私立中学，排功课表比较困难，就把部分功课排在他日，剩下的在星期六下午或星期日补授，保证不影响教学计划的完成。没参加生产的同学，在别人去生产的时候仍须留校学习。但部分学校却未能掌握这一点，形成了不参加生产的同学的变相放假。
    第五、长期性投资（如水车、牲口、水井等）的扣除办法：仅有少数学校按着折旧办法分期扣除，多数学校还没有明确规定。部分学校却规定在今年一年中扣完。某校生产委员曾向同学们说：今年别想吃不要的菜，便宜菜也不能吃。不然就没办法扣除。这种错误的扣除办法，将会严重地影响同学们的生产积极性。
    此外，还有个别学校不从实际出发，把投资额订的太高。如某校仅分到五亩地，也要打井、买牲口、水车和铁犁。有的学校则计划现在买下一年的肥料。这都是不妥当的。更错误的是个别学校到现在还没有作好准备工作，甚至没下过一次地。生产委员会从成立以来很久也不开会研究工作，或民主不足，使广大同学的生产积极性没有发动起来。这种轻视和消极地对待这一工作的现象应速克服。
    根据上述情况，京市学校生产委员会已分别鼓励了作得好的学校，并指示发生偏向的各校应立即纠正。生产委员会为进一步加强了解情况与随时指导工作，已于日前组成检查指导工作组。
