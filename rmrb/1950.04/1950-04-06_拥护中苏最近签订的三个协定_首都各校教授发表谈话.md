　　Supporting the Three Recently Signed Sino-Soviet Agreements
　　Professors from Universities in the Capital City Express Their Views
　　Tsinghua
　　Professor Fei Xiaotong of Tsinghua University stated: The three agreements recently signed between China and the Soviet Union are a concrete implementation of the clause in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance that stipulates "conducting necessary economic cooperation." The Soviet Union not only provides us with technical assistance but also invests in joint ventures with us, enabling us to realize undertakings that we cannot temporarily manage on our own. This friendship is worthy of our gratitude. Accelerating the coordination with China's industrialization and cultivating sufficient cadres as soon as possible is the task that our educators should strive to complete.
　　Professor Hua Luogeng, who recently returned to China, said: The world is now clearly divided into two major blocs: one is the aggressive bloc headed by the United States, and the other is the anti-aggression bloc headed by the Soviet Union. The brotherly cooperation of the anti-aggression bloc is the most powerful counterattack against the aggressive bloc. This cooperation strengthens our forces internally, increases our resources, and increases brotherly love; externally, it demonstrates to the world that our anti-aggression bloc's steps are unified, cooperative, and advancing in unison! The three agreements recently concluded between China and the Soviet Union are merely examples of this.
　　Professor Wu Jingchao commented on the signing of the three Sino-Soviet agreements: If a country without a heavy industry foundation wants to modernize its national economy in the short term, utilizing the experience and technical assistance of advanced countries is the most convenient and rational method. Lenin advocated the concession system, which is similar to today's Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies. The difference is that capitalist countries at that time adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union and were unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union according to the methods proposed by Lenin. We are now engaged in economic construction and have the Soviet Union, a socialist friendly nation, willing to help us. This is a better situation than that of the Soviet Union in 1921. I hope that through this assistance, our economic construction work can make rapid progress.
　　Peking University
　　Tseng Chao-lun, Dean of Peking University, said: The development of people's aviation must be supported by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union treats us completely equally in politics and economics, so that we can cultivate a large number of management and technical personnel in our work, enabling China's aviation industry to move forward.
　　Professor Wen Jiasi said: The agreement on the establishment of a Sino-Soviet civil aviation company was signed on the basis of equality and mutual assistance. We firmly believe that in the future, the Soviet Union will provide much more economic assistance to us like this. The establishment of the Sino-Soviet civil aviation company shortens the spatial distance between China and the Soviet Union and facilitates contact between the people of the two countries, which is very exciting.
　　Yenching University
　　Lin Handa, Dean of Yenching University, said: The signing of three agreements between China and the Soviet Union that are beneficial to China's construction will not only enable China to gradually embark on industrialization but also add another layer of protection to world peace. All patriotic Chinese people and all international friends who oppose imperialism will express their warm support upon hearing this news. Professor Cai Liusheng of the Chemistry Department and Gao Mingkai, Director of the Chinese Department, also expressed their views in support of the signing of the three Sino-Soviet agreements.
　　Normal University
　　Professor Huang Guozhang of the Geography Department of Normal University said: "Xinjiang is a region rich in mineral resources, especially non-ferrous metals such as oil, gold, and copper. For example, the gold mines in Tacheng and Chenghua on the southern slope of the Altai Mountains (meaning Golden Mountain in Turkic), and the oil mines in Usu and Dihua in the northern Tianshan Mountains, have very rich reserves. This time, with the friendly assistance of our friend the Soviet Union, the exploitation will undoubtedly promote the development of our industry.
　　In addition, Professor Huang Yaomian of the Chinese Department of the school also excitedly expressed his views on the signing of the three Sino-Soviet agreements.

　　拥护中苏最近签订的三个协定
    首都各校教授发表谈话
    清华
    清华大学教授费孝通发表谈话称：最近中苏两国签订的三个协定，是中苏友好同盟互助条约中所规定“进行必要的经济合作”那一条款的具体实施。苏联不但在技术上给我们援助，而且在资本上和我们合股，使我们自己能力一时不能经营的事业得以付诸实现。这种友谊是值得我们感激的。从速配合中国工业化的建设，提早培养出足够干部，这是我们教育工作者应当努力完成的任务。
    归国不久的华罗庚教授说：现在的世界很明显地分为两大集团，一是以美国为首的侵略集团，一是以苏联为首的反侵略集团。反侵略集团的兄弟般的合作，就是对侵略集团最有力量的反击。这种合作对内是加强力量，增加资源，增加兄弟般的友爱；对外则昭示世界；我们反侵略集团的步伐是统一的，合作的，齐步前进的！中苏间最近所成立的三个协定只不过是其中的例证。
    吴景超教授对中苏三个协定的签订发表意见说：一个没有重工业基础的国家，如想在短期内使国民经济的各部门走上现代化的道路，利用先进国家的经验和技术的帮助，是最方便而合理的方法。列宁所提倡的租让制，便与今日中苏的合股公司相类似。所不同的，就是当年资本主义的国家，对于苏联采仇视的态度，不肯照列宁所提出的方法来与苏联合作。我们现在进行经济建设，有苏联这样一个社会主义的友邦，肯来帮助我们，这是我们的处境，胜于一九二一年苏联之点。我希望由于这种协助，使我们经济建设的工作，可以有很快的进展。
    北大
    北大教务长曾昭抡说：发展人民航空事业必须得到苏联的帮助。苏联在政治上和经济上完全以平等待我，这样，在工作中才能大量培养我们的管理和技术人才，使中国航空事业向前发展。
    闻家驷教授说：中苏创办民航公司的协定是在平等互助的基础上签订的。我们深信将来苏联类似这种对我们在经济上的帮助，一定还有很多。中苏民航公司的成立，缩短了中苏两国空间的距离，更便利两国人民的联系，这是令人非常兴奋的事情。
    燕大
    燕京大学林汉达教务长说：中苏签订有利于中国建设的三个协定，不但是可使中国逐步走上工业化，而且使世界和平又多了一层保障。凡是爱国的中国人民以及反对帝国主义的一切国际友人听到了这个消息，都要表示热烈拥护。化学系蔡镏生教授、国文系主任高名凯也发表谈话，拥护中苏三协定的签订。
    师大
    师大地理系黄国璋教授说：“新疆乃一矿产蕴藏丰富的地区，尤以石油、金、铜等有色金属为最多。如阿尔泰山（土语金山之意）南麓的塔城、承化的金矿，天山北路乌苏、迪化等地的石油矿蕴藏量都很丰富。这次在友人苏联的友谊协助下开采，无疑将会促进我国工业的发展。
    此外，该校国文系教授黄药眠，也为中苏三协定的签订兴奋地发表了谈话。
