　　Production Decreases, Exports Plummet Sharply
    U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sawyer Admits Gloomy Economic Future
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 4th] According to the U.S. News Service, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer gave the latest report on the U.S. economy at a business conference in Florida on March 30th. In his report, although he lavishly spoke of the "obvious trend of greater production" this year, he also admitted that "the gross dollar production value in the first quarter of this year was 4% to 5% lower than the post-war production peak in the fourth quarter of 1948." At the same time, because "the demand for production equipment has been satisfied," "investment in production equipment this year is 11% lower than last year." When talking about the unemployment problem, Sawyer attributed the huge number of unemployed people in the first quarter of this year (according to official statistics, the number of fully unemployed people in February has reached 4.68 million) to "seasonal" reasons. At the same time, he also admitted without confidence that the current development of enterprises "still needs to be proven by facts whether it can lead to a decrease in the number of unemployed people." According to a Chicago dispatch from the U.S. News Service on March 30th, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp, when talking to Chicago industrialists about the "future of international trade," admitted that "exports in January of this year were the fewest in a month since October 1946."

　　生产降低出口锐减
    美国商务部长沙逸承认经济前途暗淡
    【新华社四日讯】据美新闻处讯，美商务部长沙逸三月三十日在佛罗里达州一个企业会议上，作了关于美国经济的最新报告。他在报告中虽然侈谈今年“更大量的生产是明显的趋势”，但也承认：“今年第一季的美元生产总值比一九四八年第四季战后生产最高峰低百分之四至百分之五”，同时，由于“生产设备的需求已经满足”，“生产设备的投资今年比去年低百分之十一”。谈到失业问题时，沙逸一方面将本年第一季庞大失业人数（按即据官方统计，二月份完全失业人数，已达四百六十八万）说成为“季节性”的原因；但同时又毫无信心地承认当前企业的发展，“到底能否引起失业人数的减少，尚有待事实证明”。另据美新闻处芝加哥三月三十日讯，负责经济事务的助理国务卿索尔浦对芝加哥工业界人士谈到“国际贸易的前途”时，承认“今年一月份的出口，是一九四六年十月以来最少的一月”。
