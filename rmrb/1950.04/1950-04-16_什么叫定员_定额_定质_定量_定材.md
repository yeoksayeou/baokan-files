To the Editor:

　　I have two questions that I don't know how to explain. Please answer them.

　　1. What are "fixed staffing, quotas" and "fixed staffing, quality, quantity, and materials"?

　　2. How are "state-owned" and "public-owned" explained? How are they distinguished?

Mr. Zijing:

　　Your questions are answered as follows:

　　1. "Fixed staffing, quotas, quality, quantity, and materials." In order to practice thrift and overcome waste, the state requires all agencies and public schools to stipulate the quantity ratio of staff and students, as well as the work tasks, time, and degree of completion for each staff member. This is called "fixed staffing, quotas." After "fixed staffing, quotas" are determined, if the total workload of an agency expands or shrinks, its authorized personnel should also increase or decrease accordingly. Therefore, based on "quotas and fixed staffing," it is possible to assess whether the personnel establishment of the agency is reasonable and whether there is waste. In order to strengthen the rational operation of public enterprises and strictly implement the economic accounting system, the state requires all state-owned factories and enterprises to stipulate the number of employees and the quality and quantity of production. At the same time, it is also necessary to implement a quota system for raw material consumption to eliminate the wasteful practice of hoarding materials. This is "fixed quality, quantity, and materials," which also includes "fixed staffing." As mentioned above, regardless of fixed staffing, quotas, quantity, quality, or materials, they are all calculated based on a certain period of social average work or production level as a standard. Due to the continuous improvement of the social average work or production level, fixed staffing, quotas, quality, quantity, and materials are not permanent regulations, but will be subject to necessary changes or revisions after a considerable period.

　　2. "State-owned and public-owned." Broadly speaking, all enterprises invested and managed by the state, and owned by the state, whether directly managed by the central government or managed by large administrative regions, provinces, cities, or counties, are called state-owned enterprises, because they are all people's property and owned by the state. The general distinction between "state-owned" and "public-owned" in the past was that those directly managed by the central government were called state-owned, while those managed by local governments and the agency production undertakings operated by various agencies, groups, and troops were respectively called local or agency public-owned. This is a distinction in management, but in reality, they should all be called state-owned because they are actually invested and managed by the state.

### 什么叫定员  定额  定质  定量  定材

　　什么叫定员  定额  定质  定量  定材编辑同志：
    我现有二个问题，不知如何解释。请你们答复一下。
    一、什么叫“定员、定额”及“定员、定质、定量、定材”？
    二、“国营、公营”如何解释？怎样区别？
                                                  子敬子敬先生：
    你的问题答复如下：
    一、“定员、定额、定质、定量、定材”。国家为了厉行节约，克服浪费，所有机关和公立学校，都须规定工作人员和学生的数量比例及每个工作人员的工作任务、时间及完成的程度，这叫做“定员、定额”。“定员、定额”确定以后，如果某机关的工作总量扩大或缩小时，其编制人员，亦应随之增加或减少。因此，根据“定额、定员”，便可以考核该机关人员编制是否合理，有无浪费。国家为了加强公营企业的合理经营，严格实现经济核算制度，所有国营工厂和企业，须规定职工人数及生产的质与量，同时还须实行原料消费的定额制度，铲除囤积材料的浪费行为，这就是“定质、定量、定材”，其中也包括了“定员”在内。以上所述，不论定员、定额、定量、定质和定材，都是依据某一时期社会平均的工作或生产水平作为标准计算的，由于社会平均的工作或生产水平的不断提高，所以定员、定额、定质、定量、定材，便不是永久不变的规定，而是经过相当期后也随之进行必要的变更或修正。
    二、“国营与公营”。广泛地说，凡国家投资经营，属于国家所有的企业，不论是中央直接经营管理或系大行政区、省、市、县经营管理者，都称之为国营企业，因为都是人民财产并为国家所有。一般分“国营”与“公营”两个名称，是过去将中央直接经营管理者称为国营，地方经营管理者及各机关、团体、部队所经营的机关生产事业，分别称之为地方或机关公营。这是区别管理而言，实际都应称之为国营。因为实际都是国家投资经营的。
