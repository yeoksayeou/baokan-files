　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 8th, TASS dispatch: As spring returns to the earth, the Soviet Union is actively building a new socialist countryside. The Scientific Research Institute, specifically engaged in the construction of rural areas and collective farms, has been established within the Soviet Academy of Architecture, and is starting to formulate a general plan for rural construction. This year, more than 300,000 modernized houses will be built in the rural areas of the Russian Federation. These projects will be carried out by special construction teams composed of collective farmers. In the Bryansk Oblast, collective farmers have formed more than 3,000 work teams, planning to build 8,000 houses and 100 clubs by this autumn. In the Kuban River basin, 1,200 work teams are working.

　　Nearly 100,000 collective farmers in Ukraine are engaged in constructing 50,000 houses, 18,000 farm buildings, and more than 1,000 cultural and educational institutions. It is particularly worth mentioning that two collective farm towns in Ukraine have already started construction this year. In the Kherson Oblast, on the land of the largest Stalin Collective Farm in Ukraine, collective farmers have built their first town. All construction in the new town is carried out using industrial methods. A cultural palace, middle school, transportation facilities, cultural institutions, and other institutions will be built. Beautiful houses for collective farmers are being laid. The new town is the beginning of new rural construction, and many villages in Ukraine will be redesigned according to this model.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, compiled from TASS dispatches: The electrification of the Soviet countryside is developing universally. In Ukraine, before the revolution, there was only one rural hydroelectric power station. Today, more than 4,500 collective farms obtain cheap power from local or regional hydroelectric power stations. This year, 254 collective farms in Ukraine are building their own thermal power units, and many collective farms are jointly building 84 hydroelectric power stations.

　　The Yangi-Yul Machine and Tractor Station in Uzbekistan has completed the work of erecting high-voltage power lines on the fields of many collective farms in the Tashkent Oblast. Recently, cultivation will be carried out with electricity here. All state farms in the Kurgan Oblast of the Urals are also erecting power lines. By the end of next year, all farms and affiliated enterprises and apartments there will be electrified. State farms are continuously adding a large number of electrical equipment, and labor-intensive production processes will be completely mechanized.

　　　　　Ten Oblasts of Ukraine Completed Spring Sowing Area More Than Twice That of the Same Period Last Year

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, May 5th, TASS dispatch: Spring sowing is proceeding at an ever-increasing pace in various parts of Ukraine, the main agricultural region of the Soviet Union. The cooperation between grain growers and tractor drivers has enabled collective farms in ten oblasts of Ukraine to complete the sowing of early grain. The area sown with grain is more than twice that of the same period last year. More than 60 percent of the sunflower sowing plan has been completed. The area sown with annual pasture grasses, vegetables, and other crops has more than doubled that of the same period last year. The planting of sugar beets is also earlier than last year, and tens of thousands of hectares have been planted. The characteristic of this year's spring sowing in Ukraine is the improved efficiency of cultivation and the widespread use of the latest scientific inventions. Spring wheat is sown in a checkerboard pattern in vast areas. This sowing method can increase the yield by 200 kilograms of grain per hectare. The area of topdressing of winter crops has increased by 1.3 million hectares compared with last year. In early spring, collective farmers are concentrating their efforts on maintaining soil moisture and taking advantage of the good opportunity to carry out deep plowing and careful cultivation.

　　苏联正积极建设新农村
    乡村将大量兴建现代化房舍 
    农场广泛利用发电站廉价动力
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：大地回春，苏联正积极建设社会主义的新农村。在苏联建筑科学院内，已经成立了专门进行农村与集体农场建设工作的科学研究院，着手拟订农村建设的总计划。今年俄罗斯联邦的乡村将建筑三十万余幢近代化房舍。这些工程将由集体农民组成的特别建筑工作队去执行。布利安斯克州的集体农民已组成了三千余个工作队，计划到今年秋天，要建筑起八千幢房舍，和一百个俱乐部。在库班河流域则有一千二百个工作队工作着。
    乌克兰有将近十万集体农民，从事建设五万幢房舍，一万八千座农场建筑物，和一千余个文化与教育机关。特别值得提出的是：今年乌克兰有两座集体农民的市镇已经动工。在刻松州，在乌克兰最大的斯大林集体农场的土地上，集体农民已建设了他们的第一个市镇，新市镇的一切建设都用工业方法进行，将建筑起文化宫、中学、交通机关、文化机关及其他机关。集体农民的美丽房舍，正在奠基。新市镇是新农村建设的开端，乌克兰许多乡村都将按照这个模型重新设计。
    【新华社八日讯】综合塔斯社讯：苏联农村电气化普遍发展。在乌克兰，革命前只有一个农村水力发电站，今天已有四千五百多个集体农场从当地或区的水力发电站得到廉价的动力供应。今年，乌克兰有二百五十四个集体农场正在建筑它们自己的火力发电单位，许多集体农场正在共同建筑八十四个水力发电站。
    乌兹别克的扬吉——儒尔机器与拖拉机站，已完成了在塔什干州许多集体农场的田地上架设高压电线的工作。最近此间即将以电力进行耕作。乌拉尔库尔干州的所有国家农场也正在架设电线，到明年年底该处全部农场及附设的企业、公寓，都将用电。国家农场正陆续增添许多电力设备，耗费劳力的生产过程将完全机械化。
            乌克兰十个州完成春播面积为去年同期两倍多
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社基辅五日讯：苏联主要农产区乌克兰各地正在以与日俱增的速度进行春播。谷物种植者与拖拉机驾驶员的合作，已使乌克兰十个州的集体农场完成了早谷播种。播种谷物的面积为去年同期的两倍以上。葵花子播种计划完成了百分之六十以上。播种一年生牧草、蔬菜及其他作物的面积超过了去年同期的两倍。甜菜的种植亦较去年为早，并已种植了数万公顷。乌克兰今年春播的特色，是耕作的效率提高和科学最新发明的广泛利用。广大地区的春季小麦是用棋盘式播种，这种播种方式可使每公顷多产二百公斤谷物。冬季作物的追肥面积较去年增加一百三十万公顷。初春时节，集体农民正集中力量保持泥土的润湿，并利用大好时机进行深耕细作。
