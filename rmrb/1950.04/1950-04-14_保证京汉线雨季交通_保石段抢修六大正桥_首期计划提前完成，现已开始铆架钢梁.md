　　Guaranteeing Jinghan Railway Traffic During the Rainy Season
　　Repairing Six Major Bridges on the Baoshi Section
　　First Phase of Project Completed Ahead of Schedule, Now Riveting Steel Beams
　　[Report from Baoding by our correspondent Lü Guangming] The permanent repair work on the six major bridges (five steel bridges and one cement arch bridge) on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Jinghan Railway's northern section is currently underway. Under the guidance of advanced technology from Soviet expert General Bagriev, and with the active efforts of all staff and workers of the First Engineering Division of the Railway Corps, the first phase of the bridge's underwater cement concrete pouring work was completed ahead of schedule, one month earlier than originally planned, on March 14th. The second phase of riveting steel beams has now begun. The six major bridges between Shijiazhuang and Baoding—the First, Second, and Third Shahe Rivers, the Mudaogou, the Wukong River, and the Hutuo River—total 2,104 meters in length and comprise 89 spans. The bridge foundations are all reinforced concrete, and the upper structures are modern steel beam constructions. The entire project is divided into two phases. To complete this permanent repair work before this year's flood season, work on the Wukong River, Hutuo River, and Mudaogou bridges began in late November last year, and work on the First, Second, and Third Shahe Rivers began in early February this year. The first phase of the project was successfully completed by mid-March.
　　During the construction process, construction units frequently held "bridgehead meetings" to promote collective wisdom and technical democracy, partially resolving the difficulties caused by a lack of machinery. For example, because the water in the Mudaogou was shallow, it was difficult to use a water pump. After everyone's research, a hole was blasted in the cement riverbed to maintain a certain depth of water inside, and the intake of the pump was placed in the hole, maximizing the pump's effectiveness. The Third Shahe River was being cleaned simultaneously at six well casings and only had three water pumps. Everyone made a simple road with small wooden stakes and used a flatcar to move the water pumps back and forth, so one water pump could do the work of two. When the steel inspection team was riveting the 42-meter-long Warren truss steel beams of the Hutuo River Bridge, they created a manual derrick to overcome the difficulty of not having a crane. Only six or seven people were needed to send the longitudinal and transverse beams into the Warren truss, saving more than 30 workdays compared to carrying them by hand. In addition, they created a hanging device for working between bridge spans and piers, eliminating the need to build wooden scaffolding.
　　To save labor and materials, the Third Engineering Team came up with many ideas. In the past, when driving piles in the river, the piles were high and the water was deep, so wooden frames had to be built. Thirty people used a spud driver to drive one pile, moving the frame each time, which was both time-consuming and laborious. After careful research, the team came up with a "manual rocking" method. A horizontal piece of wood was riveted onto the pile, and one person stood on it. Ropes were tied to both sides of the pile, and two or three people on each side pulled the ropes back and forth, rocking the pile two or three feet deep before manpower was used to ram it. Four or five people could drive a pile well, saving labor sixfold compared to before. When the team was pouring cement concrete bridge piers in the Wukong River, the team held technical democracy meetings and used number eight lead wire, twisting it together and attaching both ends to a tensioner to form a large iron ring, which was then placed around the outside of the formwork to replace supports and save a lot of materials. The steel inspection team also used waste materials to make tools, saving a lot of expenses. Thanks to the Soviet experts' scientific guidance, the technical difficulties in winter concrete pouring and repairing the lower structures of steel bridges were solved, allowing the project to proceed smoothly.
　　To respond to Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways' call to complete the permanent repair of the six major bridges before the flood season, the staff and workers of all units under the First Engineering Division launched a vigorous revolutionary competition. Wang Yongzhi, a comrade from the work vehicle team, told reporters that in order to strengthen the supply of various tools for carpenters and masons, the workers in the work vehicle team made axes, planes, etc. Initially, four people made eight pieces a day, but after improvements, they could make fourteen pieces with the same time and manpower. The original plan was for 30 people to complete the angle iron on the telegraph poles of the three large bridges in 40 days, but under the influence of the model role of veteran worker Huang Kuiwu, it was completed in 27 days. Now, all engineering teams are actively riveting steel beams.

　　保证京汉线雨季交通
    保石段抢修六大正桥
    首期计划提前完成，现已开始铆架钢梁
    【本报保定讯】记者吕光明报道：京汉线北段保定至石家庄间六大正桥的永久修复工程（五座钢桥，一座洋灰拱桥），现正积极进行中。经苏联专家巴格列夫将军先进技术的指导，和铁道兵团第一工程处全体职工的积极努力，第一期桥下洋灰混凝土的灌注工程，已较原计划提前一月，于三月十四日前先后完成。现已开始第二期铆架钢梁工程。石保段间一、二、三沙河，木道沟，悟空河，滹沱河等六座正桥，总长二千一百零四公尺，共计八十九孔，桥基全部是钢骨混凝土，上部是近代化的钢梁建筑，全部工程分两期进行。为了在今年洪泛前完成此项永久修复工程，在去年十一月下旬，悟空河，滹沱河，木道沟三桥即已开始动工，一、二、三沙河系于今年二月初开工。至三月中旬，已胜利结束第一期工程。
    在施工过程中，各施工单位经常召开“桥头会议”，发扬集体智慧，开展技术民主，部分地解决了机械缺乏的困难。如木道沟因水较浅，抽水机不好使用，经过大家研究，在洋灰河床上崩一个洞，使洞内的水保持一定深度，把龙头放在洞里，发挥了抽水机械的效能。第三沙河同时清理六个井筒，只有三台抽水机。大家用小木桩作成便道，把抽水机放在平车上来回运转，一架抽水机便顶两架使用。钢检队铆修滹沱河四十二公尺长的花架钢梁时，为了克服没有吊车的困难，领工牛春元、杨鸿俊等便创造了人力吊杆，只用六七个人就能把纵横梁送到花架里去，较用人抬节省三十多工。此外还创造了吊挂，在桥孔桥墩间进行工作，可以省去再搭木架脚手。
    为了省工节料，第三工程队想出了好多办法。过去在河里打桩，桩高水深，必须搭上木架子。三十个人用穿心铊拉打一根桩，打一根移动一次，既费事又费劲。该队经过精心研究，想出“人力摇晃”办法，即在一根桩上铆上一条横木，有一个人站在上面，桩的两侧拴上绳子，两边各有两三个人拉着绳头来回摇晃，待摇下二三尺深，再由人力抬夯砸打。四五个人就可打好一根桩，较前可省工六倍。该队在悟空河打洋灰混凝土的桥墩时，因该河是沙底，模型板外边没法打支撑杆子。该队开展技术民主，用八号铅丝拧起来，把两端拴在紧线器上，紧成一个大铁环，然后套在模型板外，代替了支撑，还省下好多材料。钢检队更利用废料制造工具工料，也节省下好多开支。由于苏联专家的科学指导，解决了冬季灌注混凝土和整修钢桥下部结构中的技术困难，使工程得以顺利进行。
    为响应铁道部滕部长号召在洪汛前完成六大正桥的永久修复工程，第一工程处所属各单位的职工们，开展了热烈的革命竞赛，工作车的王永治同志告诉记者说，为了加强供应木，泥工用的各种工具、工作车的工人们打斧、?刨釰等，最初四个人一天打八件，经过改进后，以同样时间和人力可以增打到十四件。原计划三十个人四十天完成三座大桥的电讯柱子上的角铁，在老工人黄奎武的模范作用影响下，二十七天便完成了。现在各工程队正积极铆架钢梁。
