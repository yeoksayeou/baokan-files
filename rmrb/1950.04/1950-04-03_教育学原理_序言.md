　　Preface to "Principles of Education"
    The book "Principles of Education" by Soviet scholar N.K. Goncharov aims to explain the principles of Soviet pedagogy. In order to elucidate the essence of the fundamental problems, the book also provides detailed annotations on how a certain pedagogical theory reflects the author's political and methodological viewpoints in its historical development. Therefore, the book covers important issues such as the interrelationship between politics and education, philosophy and pedagogy, political philosophy and pedagogy, the object of Soviet education, the goals of communist education, the content of education, the principles of didactics, and moral education. The entire book consists of eight chapters, totaling approximately 360,000 words. The entire book has now been translated and is being proofread. It will soon be completed and published by Xinhua Bookstore. The preface to the book is introduced below.
                                                 ——Translator
    The issue of the principles of education is extremely difficult and complex. All sciences are closely related to each other, so studying one science inevitably involves other sciences.
    The object of science is the entire objective world. Therefore, Engels emphasized that there is only one science—history. However, the objective world is divided into the natural world and human society, and therefore there is natural history and social history. The development and in-depth research of knowledge about nature and society have differentiated science. Science gradually refines its research object, and various individual parts become a complete system, thus new laws also appear. Engels wrote: "For each separate science, it is necessary to explain its place in the general system of things and knowledge" (Engels, "Anti-Dühring," p. 60, 1938 edition).
    The science of education has a rich history. But at the same time, it has never been isolated from other sciences. In studying the most complex issues of child rearing, education, and teaching, pedagogy always proceeds from certain general principles in terms of methodological procedures for solving these problems, and is always closely linked to politics. The development of education is not a smooth process, but has gone through sharp class struggles. The history of education systems indicates that every education system proceeds from certain methodological principles, and the struggle between these systems reflects deeper methodological and political disputes and differences.
    Any education system only possesses a certain integrity and consistency under the conditions of the existence of general principles; these general principles unify the individual principles of this system, making them purposeful.
    Studying pedagogy, like studying historical science and social science, can only be done from a certain standpoint; otherwise, it will be regarded as a pile of obsolete principles abandoned by life, rather than as an education science that develops according to the laws, constrained by the complex chains of social and political relations. Since education permanently reflects certain social relations—and this is undoubtedly the case—then these social relations cannot be observed from an anti-historical standpoint. The past has not disappeared, and human life continues to this day. The new generation must create certain productive forces, create the relationship between man and nature and their relationship with each other. These circumstances are changed by the new generation, but on the other hand, these circumstances to some extent determine the conditions of life. "History is nothing but the succession of the separate generations, each of which exploits the materials, capital funds, productive forces handed down to it by all preceding generations; thus, on the one hand, each generation continues the activity received from its predecessors, but continues it under completely changed circumstances and, on the other hand, modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed activity" ("Marx and Engels Collected Works," Vol. 4, p. 335).
    There is no doubt that the new generation must have a specific system of various educational facilities, and there must be a certain theory as the basis for organizing these facilities. Precisely because of this, the correct Marxist-Leninist attitude towards pedagogy requires that past educational thought be elaborated in a systematic way from a certain methodological standpoint, and be regarded as a law-governed development of ideas in the comprehensive experience of past generations.
    The task of this book is to explain our Soviet principles of education. At the same time, we must strive to explain how a certain pedagogical system reflects the political and methodological viewpoints of its author in its historical development; this is necessary for elucidating the essence of the fundamental problems. Therefore, we feel that politics, as the concentrated expression of economics, and philosophy are the foundation of any educational theory. The historical examination of the issue of general principles of education can make the general principles of our Soviet education more clear and understandable.
    The compilation of this book is difficult due to the fact that Soviet educators have done very little research on the essence of the issues discussed in this book. And current educational science cannot provide detailed explanations for all issues without exception. Therefore, individual shortcomings and oversights are inevitable in this book.

　　“教育学原理”序言    
    苏联Ｎ·Ｋ·冈察洛夫所著《教育学原理》，以说明苏维埃的教育学原理为目的。为了阐明基本问题的本质，该书对于某种教育学学说在其历史发展中，怎样地反映作者在政治上和方法论上的观点，也作了详尽的注释。因而该书包括了政治和教育、哲学和教育学、政治学哲学和教育学的相互关系、苏维埃教育的对象、共产主义教育的目的、教育的内容、教学论和道德教育的原理等重要问题。全书计八章，约达三十六万字。全书现已译毕，正在校订中，不久即可全部脱稿，由新华书店出版。兹将该书序言，介绍于下。
                                                 ——译者
    关于教育学原理的问题，是极困难和极复杂的。所有的科学全都相互密切地联系着，所以研究一门科学的时候，不能不涉及其他的科学。
    科学的对象是整个的客观世界。因此，恩格斯曾强调说，只有一种科学——就是历史。但是客观世界分为自然界和人类社会，因而就有自然史和社会史。关于自然界和社会的知识之发展和深入研讨，使科学有了差别。科学把自己的研究对象逐渐精确化起来，各种单独的部分变成一种完整的体系，因而也出现了新的规律。恩格斯写道：“对于每一门单独的科学，都需要说明它在事物和知识的一般体系中所占的地位”（恩格斯：《反杜林论》，第六○页，一九三八年版）。
    教育学这门科学是具有丰富的历史的。但同时它从来也不曾脱离过其他科学而孤立。在研究儿童的教养、教育和教学这些最复杂的问题时，教育学对于这些问题的解决，总是从方法论程序上一定的一般原理出发，总是和政治密切地联系在一起。教育学的发展，并不是一个平稳的过程，而是经过了尖锐的阶级斗争的。教育制度史指示出，每种教育制度，都是从一定的方法论原理出发，并且在这些制度之间的斗争，乃反映了比较深刻的方法论上和政治上的争论与分歧。
    任何一种教育制度，只是在一般的原理存在的条件下，才具有一定的完整性和一贯性；这些一般的原理，把这种制度的个别原理统一起来，使它们成为有目的的。
    研究教育学，一如研究历史科学和社会科学，只有从一定的立场出发才成，不然，它将被看做是一堆为生活所摒弃了的陈腐的原理，而不被看做是受着复杂的社会、政治关系的锁链所制约的按规律发展的教育科学。既然教育学永久是反映一定的社会关系——而这无疑地是如此——那么，这些社会关系就不能从反历史的立场来观察。过去的东西并没有消失殆尽，而人类的生活现在依然继续着。新一代的人要创立一定的生产力，创立人与自然的关系和他们彼此间的关系。这些情况是由新一代的人所改变的，可是另一方面，这些情况在某种程度上又决定着生活的条件。“历史不过是一代人一代人的连续更替，从这些更替中每一代人利用着先前各代人所交给他们的物质、资本和生产力，因此每一代的人，一方面在完全改变了的情况下继续着继承下来的事业，而另一方面则用完全改变了的事业使着旧日的情况改观”（“马、恩全集”，第四卷，第三三五页）。
    新一代的人须有各种教育设施的特定制度，并须有一定的理论，来作为组织这些设施的基础，这是毫无疑义的。正因为如此，所以正确的马列主义对于教育学的态度，要求把已往的教育思想，从一定的方法论的立场出发，以一定的体系来阐述，当做历代的综合经验中按规律发展的思想来考察。
    本书的任务，是说明我们苏维埃的教育学原理。同时我们要力求说明，某种教育学体系在其历史的发展中，是怎样地反映其著作者在政治上和方法论上的观点；这对于阐明基本问题的本质，是有这种必要的。因此，我们觉得作为经济集中表现的政治以及哲学，乃是任何教育学理论的基础。对于教育学一般原理的问题加以历史的考察，可以把我们苏维埃教育学的一般原理，研究得更为清楚和更为明白。
    本书的编著，由于这样的情形而感到困难，即就本书所讨论的问题本质而言，苏维埃教育家研究得很少。而目前的教育科学，又不可能对一切问题都毫无例外地加以详尽的说明。因此在本书中，个别的缺点和照顾不到的地方，是在所难免的。
