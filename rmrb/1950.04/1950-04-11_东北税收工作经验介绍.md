Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 10th:

　　Since October of last year, urban taxation in Northeast China has been further emphasized and strengthened, along with the gradual transformation of the overall financial work. If we compare the situation from 1948 to the present, year by year and quarter by quarter, we can see that urban taxation in Northeast China is growing rapidly. Calculated annually, 1949 increased more than five times compared to 1948, and the budget for 1950 increased ten times compared to 1948. Divided by quarter, if we consider the first quarter of 1949 as 100%, the second quarter rose to 187%, the third quarter to 290%, and the fourth quarter increased to 635%. The first quarter of this year is the peak season for taxation, and a commodity supplementary tax was collected, so the tax revenue for January and February exceeded the original plan by 43%. As of the 21st, the task of currency withdrawal in March has also exceeded the original figure.
    The growth of urban taxation in Northeast China is due, on the one hand, to the gradual development of urban work and the increasing recovery and development of industry and commerce, but more importantly, it is due to the attention of leading organs at all levels and the responsible efforts of tax workers. Since March of last year, in the process of shifting the focus of work from rural areas to cities, the Northeast People's Government has repeatedly emphasized and clarified the importance of urban taxation, fundamentally changing the common idea among cadres of underestimating taxation, as well as the erroneous views that one-sidedly emphasize the development of industry and commerce, or that progressive taxation hinders the development of industry and commerce. Governments at all levels have strengthened their leadership and assistance to tax work. After the Northeast Provincial and Municipal Tax Bureau Chiefs Conference in October last year, tax authorities at all levels corrected the incorrect view among cadres that the task was contradictory to the policy, actively explored tax sources, established departments specializing in direct taxes, and strengthened planning. They changed the past practice of only assigning overall tasks without assigning specific tasks at each level. They formulated income plans from top to bottom, assigning tasks all the way down to the county level. After accepting the tasks, the provincial, municipal, and county tax bureaus formulated specific plans and assigned tasks based on local possibilities. Except for a few places, the tasks assigned generally exceeded the quota set by the Northeast Tax Bureau. The potential increase in state revenue greatly encouraged the tax workers. During the peak tax season last winter and from January to March this year, they worked tirelessly day and night. Zhang Min, director of the Shuangliao County Tax Bureau in Liaoxi Province, provided specific leadership and took the lead in working hard during the collection of industrial and commercial income tax. He went to bed late every night, and despite being weak and coughing up blood, he insisted on completing and exceeding the task. The Northeast Tax Bureau continuously sent cadres above the section chief level to lead work groups to inspect work in various places in rotation. Tax bureaus in provinces such as Liaodong and Songjiang also frequently had a director go deep into the lower levels to urge and help with the work.
    In terms of mastering the key points of tax sources and gaining an in-depth understanding of tax sources, significant progress has been made in the past six months. This is one of the main keys to exceeding the task. Before 1948, due to the unfinished war and the abnormal state of industry and commerce, urban taxation was decentralized and focused on indirect taxes. In 1948, industrial and commercial taxes in the entire Northeast region only accounted for about 20% of the total tax revenue. When collecting this part of the industrial and commercial tax, only democratic appraisal was used, without combining it with typical investigations, so it was not possible to effectively implement the policy of reasonable burden. Starting in August last year, the entire region began unified collection, and in addition to closely monitoring the inspection and management of indirect taxes, it was proposed to strengthen the investigation and research of direct taxes. From November last year to February this year, during the second phase of pre-collection and year-end actual collection of industrial and commercial income tax, typical investigations were conducted in various places, revealing the behavior of private industrial and commercial operators in reporting false accounts. The most common rate of concealed income was one to two times. The Zhenxinghao grocery store in Qiqihar City concealed its income by as much as 38 times its self-reported amount. The result of exposing false accounts not only increased tax revenue and boosted the confidence of cadres in exceeding tasks, but also changed the attitude of industrial and commercial operators from complaining about "heavy taxes" in the past to acknowledging that the burden was fair and reasonable. After breaking through the false accounts, Heilongjiang and Liaodong provinces exceeded the task by one time in the actual collection at the end of last year. Tax officials in the Liaoxi New Area expressed hesitation when they initially received the task, fearing that they would not be able to complete it; since January, after typical investigations, they have generally exceeded the task.
    The investigation of false accounts generally includes the following aspects: (1) In each industry, according to the size of capital and business scale, classify them into different grades, and select typical representatives of each grade for investigation. For example, Heilongjiang Province divides private shops and factories in each industry into upper, middle, and lower grades, and finds several typical households in each. After discovering false accounts, hold industry seminars and use comparison methods to mobilize each household to report false accounts. (2) When checking accounts, first collect information about the household's business situation, management methods, number of employees, daily living expenses, joint venture, sole proprietorship, or counter partner relationships, compare and analyze them, and review them in detail together with the household's account books, receipts, delivery orders, account statements, and other relevant documents. Then conduct a physical inventory, and then review the purchase accounts based on the physical inventory accounts. (3) Understand the situation through side investigations. For example, before the collection in Andong City, a meeting of shop employee representatives was held, and false accounts were found through the shop employees. Jinzhou City obtained materials from state-owned enterprises and found false accounts in the city's private printing industry. While breaking through false accounts, all localities helped medium and large-sized private industrial and commercial operators establish account books and invoice systems in order to further grasp their business situation. According to statistics in Andong City as of mid-January, nearly 3,000 industrial and commercial households have established account books, accounting for 47% of the city's industrial and commercial households, an increase of more than 84% compared to the number of accounts last year. As of recently, in counties such as Nehe in Heilongjiang Province, those who have established account books account for 40% to 50% of the total. All localities strive to ensure that 80% of industrial and commercial operators establish account books and invoices within a certain period. This system is an important means of tax management. According to statistics from Boli County, Songjiang Province, the amount of money sold after the establishment of invoices generally increased by 50% compared to the self-reported amount of money sold.
    Another factor guaranteeing increased income is reducing tax evasion. After October last year, the Northeast Tax Bureau grasped the key points and overcame the past bias of using forces equally and having more internal personnel than external personnel. For example, in the deployment of the tax network, it is not mechanically allocated according to administrative divisions, but rather decided to increase, decrease, or abolish them according to the size of the tax source. Andong City abolished and reduced three unnecessary tax offices and strengthened important branch offices. Shenyang City originally set up six tax bureaus evenly according to districts instead of tax sources, resulting in a lot of tax evasion. Now, it has reduced two unnecessary branch offices and increased six collection offices in the key areas of tax sources to facilitate the control of the collection surface and gradually reduce tax evasion. External anti-smuggling work has also been gradually strengthened. At present, most localities have reached the ratio of two internal personnel to one external personnel in the allocation of tax personnel, and they plan to achieve one internal personnel to one external personnel in the future. Songjiang Province has proposed to achieve one internal personnel to two external personnel this year. The Changchun City Tax Bureau in Jilin Province has also organized an anti-smuggling team. After strengthening anti-smuggling work, the Siping Railway Station can find more than 50 cases of tax evasion every month on average. After the reduction of internal personnel in tax bureaus in various places, work efficiency has also been greatly improved. The invoice review section of the Liaodong Provincial Tax Bureau originally had 16 people, each reviewing 15,000 tax invoices per month. Now, with seven people, each can review more than 39,000 invoices per month. Another major aspect of expanding anti-smuggling work is to closely cooperate with other agencies and mobilize the masses to assist in anti-smuggling. Tax bureaus in various places in Songjiang Province and public security bureaus have achieved joint inspections. Due to the strengthening of inspection work, the province exceeded the tax revenue task for the first quarter by 6.8% in January and February.
    In terms of collection methods, various places in Northeast China have begun to implement the responsibility system with emphasis. Andong City has achieved preliminary results in this regard. Referring to the experience of Dalian City, where one person manages 100 households, the city divides each 300 households into a responsible area, with two cadres in each area responsible for management. In Andong, Yingkou, and Hulan and Boli in Songjiang Province, taxpayer mutual aid groups are organized in the responsible areas, generally 10 households per group, with small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators elected by the industrial and commercial households as the group leader. A covenant is established within the group to ensure that no false accounts are made, and if false accounts are found, the entire group is responsible. In this way, taxpayers supervise each other and report other people's false accounts to the tax bureau, which has achieved remarkable results. The reason why Andong City's tax revenue ratio in January and February can relatively exceed Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun, and make industrial and commercial operators bear an average of only 12.8%, is closely related to the implementation of the responsibility system and the organization of industrial and commercial households. In order to strengthen the management of taxpayers, for small and medium-sized businesses that cannot keep accounts, a periodic fixed-amount tax system is adopted, with a three-month period and monthly payments. When determining the tax amount, conduct careful investigation and research first, and then make mutual comparisons; when there are changes in business, the tax amount is also changed at any time. After trying this system in Harbin, Anshan, and other places, taxpayers are quite satisfied. In the collection process, attention is also paid to cultivating upright industrial and commercial operators, and timely rewards are given to those who take the lead in paying taxes into the treasury, or report other people's false accounts, or are actively responsible in the evaluation process.
    According to the existing materials from various places, the burden rate of industrial and commercial operators is reasonable. However, due to the failure to grasp the overall true materials, there are still imbalances between some large, medium, and small cities, and between large, medium, and small businesses. After the Spring Festival, various places in Northeast China have begun a comprehensive investigation from point to area. The content includes the number of private industrial and commercial operators, capital, trade volume, profit margin, expenditure rate, and turnover of working capital. The purpose of this investigation is to fully grasp the business situation of industrial and commercial operators and lay the foundation for taxing based on actual turnover and income. At present, when collecting income tax, the method of "self-reporting by operators, typical investigation, and democratic appraisal" is still adopted, because in the absence of a universally established accurate account book and invoice system, and the inability to implement strict management, this method must still be adopted in order to ensure income. When collecting business tax starting in March, it has been tried to collect it without appraisal, but by self-reporting combined with account verification, while small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators without accounts adopt a periodic fixed-amount tax system. It is planned to gradually promote it after gaining experience in pilot projects. The purpose of doing so is to gradually improve the collection method of typical investigation and democratic appraisal in a measured and step-by-step manner, so as to transition from this to "self-reporting and verification collection" under comprehensive and strict management. Preliminary experience has shown that areas that have implemented the responsibility system, organized industrial and commercial mutual aid groups, and combined investigations have collected business tax into the treasury faster and have been able to exceed the task. For example, after Yingkou City deployed the task of collecting business tax for January and February at the end of February, most of it was put into the treasury on March 4. As of now, Heishan County in Liaoxi Province has exceeded the task by 57%.
    The main shortcomings and biases existing in the urban tax work in Northeast China are that the taxation of large cities is not grasped tightly enough. For example, the Shenyang City Tax Bureau does not pay attention to typical investigations and only relies on democratic appraisal by merchants and people, so the proportion of Shenyang's tax revenue is still behind other parts of Northeast China. Secondly, it only pays attention to grasping the industrial and commercial tax tightly and relatively relaxes the timely supervision and inspection of commodity tax. In the future, in addition to paying attention to strengthening the leadership of taxation in large cities and grasping the inspection and management of commodity tax, we will further study the collection methods of business tax and strengthen the ideological and business education of tax cadres, overcoming the complacency of some tax cadres that "the materials have been almost obtained." From April to September, tax revenue will enter the off-season, and it is necessary to work even harder to ensure the completion and exceeding of tax revenue tasks.

　　东北税收工作经验介绍
    自去年十月以来，东北的城市税收，随着整个财政工作的逐步转变，而被进一步重视和加强了。如果把一九四八年到现在的情况按年按季地加以比较，就可看到东北的城市税收是在迅速增长着。以年度来计算，一九四九年较一九四八年增加了五倍多，而一九五○年的预算，则比一九四八年增加了十倍。以季度来分，如把一九四九年第一季度算作百分之百，第二季度就上升为百分之一百八十七，第三季度为百分之二百九十，第四季度增加到百分之六百三十五。今年第一季度为税收旺季，并征收了货物补税，因此一、二月份的税收，超过了原订计划的百分之四十三。三月份的回笼货币任务，截至二十一日止，也超过了原定的数字。
    东北城市税收的增长，一方面是由于城市工作的逐步开展，工商业的日益恢复发展，而更重要的则是各级领导机关的重视和税务工作人员的努力负责。去年三月以后，在执行工作重心从乡村转变到城市的过程中，东北人民政府一再强调阐明城市税收的重要性，基本上改变了干部思想中较普遍存在的轻视税收的思想，以及片面强调发展工商业、或以为按累进课税有碍工商业发展等的错误观点。各级政府都加强了对税收工作的领导和帮助。去年十月，东北各省市税务局长会议以后，各级税务机关纠正了干部中认为任务与政策矛盾的不正确观点，积极开辟税源，并增设了专管直接税的部门，同时加强了计划性，改变了过去只布置总任务而没有层层布置具体任务的做法，上下结合地制定了收入计划，将任务一直布置到县。而各省、市、县税务局在接受任务后，又都根据当地的可能订出具体计划布置任务。其中除个别地方外，一般所布置的任务都超过了东北税务总局的预定额。国家收入的可能增加，大大鼓舞了税务工作人员。去年冬季及今年一至三月税收旺季中，他们都不分昼夜星期地紧张工作。辽西省双辽县税务局局长张敏在征收工商所得税期内，具体领导、带头苦干，每天到深夜才睡觉，虽体弱吐血，仍坚持完成并超过了任务。东北税务总局不间断地派出处长以上的干部，领导工作小组轮流到各地检查工作。辽东、松江等省税务局也经常有一个局长深入下层督促帮助工作。
    在掌握税源重点和深入了解税源方面，半年来是显著地大进了一步。这是超过任务的主要关键之一。在一九四八年前，由于战争没有结束，工商业还不正常，所以城市税收是分散的，而且偏重于间接税。全东北一九四八年的工商税，只占全部税收总额的百分之二十左右。在征收这部分工商税时，又仅依据民主评议，没有结合典型调查，因此不能够很好地贯彻合理负担政策。去年八月起，全区开始了统一征收，除了抓紧间接税的稽查、管理外，还提出加强直接税的调查研究。去年十一月至今年二月，在第二期工商所得税预征及年末实征中，各地都进行了典型调查，揭露私营工商业者报假账的行为，其隐瞒所得率最普遍的是一倍至二倍。齐齐哈尔市振兴号杂货店隐瞒所得竟达其自报额的三十八倍。揭露假账的结果，不仅增加了税收、提高了干部超过任务的信心；而且使工商业者由过去的埋怨“税重”，改变为承认负担公平合理。黑龙江、辽东两省突破假账后，去年底实征超过任务一倍。辽西新区税务人员，在初接到任务时，表示犹疑，怕完成不了任务；一月份以来，经过典型调查，均已普遍超过任务。
    查假账时，一般包括下列几个方面：（一）在每个行业中依资金大小、营业规模，分别等级，选出代表该等级的典型来进行调查。如黑龙江省把每种行业的私营商店、工厂分成上中下三种，在每种里边找出几户典型。查出假账后，再开行业座谈会，利用评比方式，动员各户报出假账。（二）查账时要首先收集有关该户之营业情况、经营方法、从业人数、日常生活用费、合资、独资或柜伙等关系，加以对照、分析，并与该户的账目单据、发送货单、往来户头及其他各种有关的单据一起详细审查。然后进行点货，再根据点货账对照购货账审查。（三）通过侧面调查了解情况，如安东市在征收前，先开店员代表会，通过店员查出了假账。锦州市从公营企业中得出材料，查出了该市私营印刷业的假账。与突破假账同时，各地都帮助中等以上的私营工商业者建立账簿与发货票制度，以便进一步掌握他们的营业情况。安东市截至一月中旬统计，建立账簿的工商业户将近三千家，占全市工商业数的百分之四十七，较去年有账户增加了百分之八十四强。黑龙江省讷河等县，到最近为止，建立账簿者占总数的百分之四十到五十。各地争取在一定期限内做到百分之八十的工商业者都建立账簿与发货票。这一制度是税务管理上的重要手段。据松江省勃利县统计，建立发货票后的卖钱额，一般较其自报卖钱额增加百分之五十。
    保证增加收入的另一个因素，是减少偷漏。东北税务总局在去年十月后，抓住重点，克服了过去平均使用力量及内部人员多于外部人员的偏向。如在税网布置上，不机械地按照行政区划来配备，而是根据税源的大小，分别决定增强、减少或撤销。安东市撤销和减少了三个不必要的税务所，加强了重要的分所。沈阳市原来未按税源而是按分区平均地设了六个税务分局，结果偷漏很多，现在裁减了两个不必要的分局，改在税源重点上增设六个稽征所，便于控制征收面，逐渐减少了偷漏。外部的缉私工作也已逐渐加强。各地目前在税务人员配备上，大部已达到里面二人外面一人的比例，准备在将来做到里一外一。松江省已提出要在今年内做到里一外二。吉林省长春市税务局还组织了稽私队。四平车站在加强缉私工作后，平均每月都可查出偷税案件五十多件。各地税务局内部人员减少后，工作效率也大大提高。辽东省税务局票照审核股，原来十六个人，每人每月审核税票一万五千张，现在七个人，每人每月可审票三万九千多张。扩大缉私工作的另一个主要方面，是和其他机关密切配合，并发动群众来协助缉私。松江省各地税务局与公安局做到联合检查。由于稽查工作的加强，该省在一、二两个月份内就超过了第一季税收任务的百分之六点八。
    在征收方法上，东北各地已开始有重点地实行专责制。安东市在这方面并已取得初步成绩。该市参照大连市一人管理一百户的经验，按每三百户划分专管区，每区设干部两名专责管理。安东、营口和松江省呼兰、勃利等地，在专管区内再组织纳税工商互助小组，一般每十户为一组，由工商户自选中小工商业者为组长。小组内订立公约，保证不搞假账，如查出假账时，由全组负担。这样，纳税者互相督促，向税局揭发别人假账，收效显著。安东市一、二月份税收比重所以能相对地超过沈阳、哈尔滨和长春，并使工商业者平均只负担百分之十二点八，是和实行专责制与组织工商业户有密切关系的。为了加强对纳税者的管理，凡不会记账的中小商号，即采取定期定额税制，三个月一期，按月交纳。在确定税额时，先经过认真调查研究，再作相互比较；营业有变动时，税额也随时变更。哈尔滨、鞍山等地试行这一制度后，纳税者颇为满意。在征收中，也注意了培养正直的工商业者，对自己争先纳税入库、或揭发别人假账，或在评议中积极负责的，都给予及时的奖励。
    据各地现有的材料来看，工商业者的负担率是合理的。但由于对全盘真实材料尚未掌握，若干大中小城市之间、大中小商户之间，还存在着不平衡现象。春节以后，东北各地已开始了由点推向面的全面调查。内容包括私营工商业者的户数、资本、贸易额、利润率、开支率及流动资金周转情况。这一调查的目的，是全盘掌握工商业者的营业情况，打下按实际营业额及所得课税的基础。目前在征收所得税时，仍采取“业者自报、典型调查、民主评议”的方法，因为在没有普遍建立精确的账簿与发货票制度、还不可实行严格的管理时，为着保证收入，这个办法还是必须采取的。三月份开始征收营业税时，已试行不经过评议、而按自报结合查账的方法征收，无账的中小工商业者则采取定期定额税制。计划在试点取得经验后，再逐渐推广。这样做的目的是为了有把握、有步骤地逐渐将典型调查、民主评议的征收方法提高一步，以便由此过渡到全面严格管理下的“自报查征”。目前初步经验证明：凡实行了专责制、组织了工商互助小组、结合了调查的地区，营业税征收入库都较快，并能超过任务。如营口市二月底布置了征收一、二月份营业税任务后，三月四日即大部入库。辽西省黑山县，截至目前为止，已超过任务百分之五十七。
    东北城市税收工作中，存在的缺点和偏向，最主要的是对大城市的税收还抓得不紧。如沈阳市税务局，不重视典型调查，只凭商人民主评议，因此沈市税收比重至今尚落后于东北其他各地。其次，只注意抓紧了工商业税，相对地放松了对货物税的及时督促检查。今后除注意加强对大城市税收的领导和抓紧货物税的稽查、管理外，还将进一步研究营业税的征收方法，并加强税务干部的思想教育与业务教育，克服目前部分税务干部中存在着的所谓“材料已搞得差不多了”的自满情绪。四月起至九月，税收进入淡季，更需要加倍努力工作，才能保证完成并超过税收任务。
