To strictly prevent the recurrence of plague this year, Chahar Province is actively carrying out various epidemic prevention measures. The Chahar-Mongolia Plague Prevention and Control Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, stationed in the province, formed epidemic prevention teams of nearly a hundred people on March 28th and April 6th respectively, and went to the Zuyin area of Inner Mongolia, Kangbao in northern Chahar, and Jijiabafangzi Village in the Fourth District of Zhangjiakou City, and other areas where plague occurred last year, to begin organizing and leading the masses to carry out plague prevention work. The provincial government has also prepared 700,000 doses of live plague vaccine, which are being transported to various epidemic areas and will be ready to begin comprehensive injections in epidemic areas around the 15th. The second echelon of epidemic prevention personnel, currently undergoing training, is also stepping up training and equipping themselves and will soon go to the epidemic areas to work. Since the conclusion of last year's epidemic prevention work, the leading organs have repeatedly pointed out that all localities should pay close attention to this year's epidemic prevention work and have conducted inspections and supervisions several times. According to the most recent inspection results, the epidemic prevention work in the Zuyin area of Inner Mongolia has been done relatively well, while in the Kangbao area of northern Chahar, the county epidemic prevention committee has neglected epidemic prevention work, and work such as digging rat-proof ditches and catching rats has not been carried out, and the masses' understanding of epidemic prevention is extremely poor. After learning about this situation, the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Committee has telegraphed the Chahar North Epidemic Prevention Committee to quickly correct the shortcomings in the Kangbao County epidemic prevention work and urge it to mobilize its forces and actively begin epidemic prevention work. The Chahar Provincial People's Government also issued instructions on this year's plague prevention and control work a few days ago. It pointed out the serious losses caused by last year's plague epidemic and warned all epidemic areas that without necessary preventive work, the possibility of plague recurrence this year is very high; if it occurs in spring and summer, the spread will inevitably be even more severe. Therefore, it requires all localities to first carry out extensive publicity and education, break through the ideological barriers of cadres, improve grassroots health organizations, and, in conjunction with production and other work, use various gatherings, people's schools, markets, temple fairs, etc. to carry out publicity and educate the masses to understand the severity of the plague and the importance of prevention. In areas where plague occurred last year and in nearby villages, rat-proof ditches should be dug universally, to be completed by the end of April. At the same time, carry out mass cleaning and hygiene work, and mobilize the masses to inject plague prevention vaccines; and prepare for epidemic reporting, blockade and isolation, disinfection and treatment, and other work, so that in case of a plague outbreak, it can be "discovered there and eliminated there." In addition, the instructions require each county to create at least one or two pilot villages to lay a solid foundation for long-term epidemic prevention work.

　　严防本年再发生鼠疫
    察省加强防疫工作
    即将开始疫区普遍预防注射
    【本报察哈尔讯】察哈尔省为切实防止鼠疫再起，正积极进行各种防疫措施。驻该省的中央人民政府卫生部察蒙鼠疫防治所，已于三月二十八日及四月六日分别组成近百人的防疫队前往内蒙租银地、察北康保及张家口市四区姬家房子村等去年曾发生鼠疫的地区，开始组织领导群众，进行鼠疫预防工作。省府并预备了七十万人份的鼠疫生菌疫苗，正分别运往各疫区，十五日左右即可开始疫区全面注射工作。正在受训中的防疫第二梯队，亦加紧训练装备，不久即可赴疫区工作。该省自去年防疫工作告一段落后，领导机关曾再三指出各地严格注意今年的防疫工作，并数度进行检查督促。据最近检查结果，内蒙租银地防疫工作作得较好，而察北康保地区因县防疫委员会忽视防疫工作，挖防鼠沟、捕鼠等工作均未进行，群众对防疫的认识极差。省防疫委员会了解此一情况后，已电察北防疫委员会迅速纠正康保县防疫工作中的缺点，促其动员力量，积极开始防疫工作。察省人民政府亦于日前发出关于本年防治鼠疫工作的指示。指出去年鼠疫流行所引起的严重损失，并警告各疫区，如无必要的预防工作，今年鼠疫再次发生的可能性很大；如在春夏发生，蔓延势必更凶。因此要求各地首先进行广泛的宣传教育，打通干部思想，健全基层卫生组织，并结合生产及其他工作，利用各种集会、民校、集市、庙会等进行宣传，教育群众认识鼠疫的严重与预防的重要。在去年发生鼠疫地区及其附近村庄，普遍挖防鼠沟，限四月底完成。同时开展群众性的清洁卫生工作，并动员群众注射鼠疫预防菌苗；并作好疫情报告、封锁隔离、消毒治疗等工作的准备工作，以备万一发生鼠疫时作到“发现在那里，消灭在那里”。此外，指示要求每县至少要作一个或两个试点村，打下长期防疫工作的坚强基础。
