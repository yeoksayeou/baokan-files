Guaranteeing Supply of Fuel to the Masses and Recapturing Currency
    Coal Companies in Various Regions Vigorously Promote Coal Sales
    Breaking Conservative Thinking and Implementing the Policy of Small Profits and Quick Turnover
    [Our Newspaper News] Special Correspondent Xu Dake reports: In order to implement the directive of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to "think of all kinds of ways to vigorously promote materials and complete the task of currency recapture," the branch companies of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company are vigorously promoting sales in various regions. At present, there is a large amount of coal stored throughout the country, while many small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas still face a shortage of fuel. How to sell the large amount of stockpiled coal to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas that need coal has become an extremely important task for coal companies in various regions at present. In March, in order to cooperate with stabilizing prices and implementing large-scale coal sales, various district companies set sales targets much higher than in February. Due to the active efforts of all cadres in various regions, as of March 15, the coal sales task in the Central South Region has been completed by 65%, and the East China Region by 38%. As of the 20th, the Shijiazhuang branch company has completed 56%, the Handan branch company 50%, the Beijing branch company 45%, the Xinxiang branch company 41%, and the Tianjin branch company 24%. Judging from the sales figures, except for the Central South Region, other regions have not yet completed their tasks.

    The reasons why the sales work achieved some results during this period were, first of all, that the leading cadres clarified their thinking, broke the conservative thinking that emphasized seasonality and supply-demand relationships, actively and resolutely expanded their business, and made good preparations for mobilization and organization in advance, while also closely monitoring, supervising, and providing timely guidance during the sales process. They concentrated all their strength and sent a large number of cadres out to sell coal. For example, the Xinxiang branch company only left accounting personnel to watch the house, and the responsible cadres of the company and coal plant led a large number of cadres to the streets and countryside, and stipulated the sales tasks for each person, thus greatly increasing the coal sales figures. Comrade Li Guichun, the head of the iron industry section of the company, sold 4,800 tons of coal in ten days, exceeding the original task by 92%. The Shijiazhuang branch company sent people to various stations along the Shide and Shiba Line railways to assist in inspecting coal sales and clearly allocated tasks, launching a coal sales competition, and putting forward the slogan that nothing can be delayed except coal sales. The Handan branch company even sent the dispatch and receiving clerk out to sell coal. The Tangshan office, which had never sold coal before, also started selling coal. The Beijing branch company formed seven or eight groups, and even the head of the general affairs section participated in the sales group, and signed a long-term contract with the Beijing bathhouse industry. Only the Tianjin branch company completed the least amount of its task because the leading cadres did not grasp the situation tightly and did not organize street and rural coal sales well.

    This coal sale was a correct implementation of the policy of small profits and quick turnover. In the past, coal prices were higher in some areas, and coal users needed coal but could not afford it. This time, it was thoroughly corrected. For example, the Hengshui office could not sell coal due to high prices in the past, but the coal sales figures increased immediately after reducing prices. Another sales method is to universally establish agency sales relationships with cooperatives and set up more coal sales agencies. The Shijiazhuang branch company universally established relationships with cooperatives at various stations along the railway line and sent people to assist them in selling coal. At stations without cooperatives and with a large amount of coal sales, people were stationed to sell coal or coal plants were established. In order to ensure timely supply, the Shijiazhuang branch company also sent people to Yangquan, Jingxing, and other places to contact the station at any time and signed a transportation contract with the railway bureau, thus timely solving the transportation difficulties.

    Improving quality and maintaining credibility are also important keys to developing business. During the peak season, some coal in the Beijing branch company was upgraded, and some coal contained more stones, which affected sales. Now, the grades have been re-ordered according to the coal quality, and stones have been picked out in the mining area and Beijing plant to improve the quality and change the business situation.

    In the future, in order to resolutely implement coal sales, complete and exceed the task, the following existing phenomena must be corrected in various regions. That is, in some individual regions, because they are used to engaging in allocation work, they still cannot overcome the "official-run" style and still have the phenomenon of being willing to wholesale and unwilling to retail, and even some cadres are unwilling to engage in the coal industry work, calling the coal industry work "unlucky" work. This bias must be thoroughly corrected.

    Secondly, in large cities, due to incomplete institutions, such as Shanghai, Tianjin and other large cities, there are very few coal plants, making it extremely inconvenient for citizens to purchase coal, and in some areas, the amount of coal sold must be more than one ton, and no processing and manufacturing of coal balls is carried out, which is very inconvenient for the majority of coal users. Therefore, in addition to actively combining with cooperatives and retail companies to handle retail sales, the coal industry departments must also set up more business offices, coal plants, and agency sales stores. What is particularly important is to organize processing and open retail coal ball shops to solve the problem of coal burning for citizens. Beijing plans to organize 200 coal ball shops, Tianjin plans to organize 500, and other regions should also start organizing immediately according to the specific situation. In addition, North China should set up more coal sales agencies on major traffic arteries and river wharves, and East China and Central South China should develop from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and along railway lines to vigorously expand the sales area in order to complete and exceed the task.

　　保证供应群众燃料回笼货币
    各地煤业公司大力销煤
    打破保守思想贯彻薄利多销方针
    【本报讯】特约通讯员徐大可报道：中国煤业建筑器材公司为贯彻中央人民政府贸易部“想尽各种办法大力推销物资完成回笼任务”的指示，各地分公司正大力进行推销。目前全国各地存煤甚多，而许多中小城市和广大农村则尚存在着缺乏燃料情形。如何把积压的大量存煤推销到需要煤的中小城市和农村里去，就成为各地煤业公司当前极其重要的任务。三月份各区公司为了配合稳定物价及贯彻大量卖煤，规定了远较二月份为高的推销任务，由于各地全体干部的积极努力，截至三月十五日，中南区销煤任务已完成百分之六十五，华东区完成百分之三十八；截至二十日石家庄分公司完成百分之五十六，邯郸分公司完成百分之五十，北京分公司完成百分之四十五，新乡分公司完成百分之四十一，天津分公司完成百分之二十四。从推销数字上看除中南区外，其他地区尚未完成。
    这一时期推销工作之所以获得一些成绩，首先是从领导干部起搞通了思想，打破强调季节性与供求关系的保守思想，积极地坚决地向外伸展业务，并事先作好动员和组织工作，在推销中抓紧检查、督促与及时指导。他们集中了一切力量，抽出大批干部出外卖煤。如新乡分公司只留会计人员看家，公司及煤厂的负责干部均带领着大批干部下街、下乡，并规定每个人的推销任务，因而卖煤数字大见增加，该公司铁业股长李贵春同志，在十天当中卖了四、八○○吨煤，超过原规定任务的百分之九十二。石家庄分公司派人到沿铁路石德、石保线各站，协助检查卖煤，并明确的分配了任务，开展了卖煤竞赛，提出了误了什么也不能误了卖煤的口号。邯郸分公司连收发员都出去卖煤。向来不卖煤的唐山办事处也开始卖煤。北京分公司组成七、八个小组，连总务股长也参加了推销组，并与京市澡堂业签订长期合同。只有天津分公司，因为领导干部抓得不紧，没有很好地组织下街、下乡卖煤，因而完成任务最少。
    这次卖煤是正确的执行了薄利多销方针。过去有些地区煤价较高，用煤户需要煤而买不起煤，这次则彻底的加以纠正，如衡水办事处过去售价高卖不了煤，减低价格后卖煤数字即见增加。另一个推销的方法是普遍地与合作社建立代销关系和多设销煤机构。石家庄分公司普遍地与沿铁路线各站的合作社建立关系，并派人协助其卖煤。没有合作社和销煤多的车站，住人卖煤或设立煤厂。石家庄分公司为了保证及时供应并派人到阳泉、井陉等地，随时与车站连系，并与路局签订运输合同，因而及时解决了运输上的困难问题。
    又提高质量，保持信誉也是开展业务的重要关键。北京分公司在旺月期间有些煤升了级，有些煤含石较多，影响了销路，现已根据煤质重新订出等级，并在矿区及京厂挑出石头，提高质量，以转变业务。
    今后为了坚决贯彻卖煤，完成并超过任务，各地必须改正以下尚存在的现象。即是仍有个别地区，因搞惯调配工作，还不能克服“官办”的作风，仍存在着愿意作批发不愿意作零售的现象，甚或有的干部不愿意搞煤业工作，把煤业工作叫作“倒霉”工作，这种偏向必须彻底纠正。
    其次是在大城市中由于机构尚不健全，如上海、天津等大城市煤厂极少，市民购买极为不便，更有的地区卖煤数量必须在一吨以上，且不办理加工和制造煤球，使广大用煤户十分不便。为此，各煤业部门除了积极结合合作社及零售公司办理零售外，并须多设经营处，煤厂，代销店，而特别重要的是组织加工和开设零售煤球铺解决市民烧煤。现北京市计划组织二百个煤球铺，天津计划组织五百个，其他地区亦应根据具体情况，即刻着手组织。此外，华北区应在交通要道、河路码头多设销煤机构，华东、中南区应由大城市向中小城市和沿铁路线发展，大力扩展推销面，以完成并超过任务。
