Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 27th: The Headquarters of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has issued a communiqué on the first stage of the Hainan Island campaign, stating:

	A part of our army, in order to liberate the Central South mainland, launched a seaborne operation to eliminate the remnant bandits in Qiongya. Our army, with two powerful units starting from the Leizhou Peninsula, and in coordination with the Qiongya Column and our advance batch of secretly landed troops, on the morning of April 17th, shattered the joint defense of the enemy's land, sea, and air forces, broke through the bandit's northern Hainan coastal defense line, and successfully achieved landing in front of the enemy.

	The western route of our army landed in the area of Bopu Port and Lingao Cape, defeating two regiments of the 131st Division of the bandit's 64th Army's coastal defense troops and annihilating a part of them. On the 19th, we continued to annihilate most of the guard battalion of the 156th Division headquarters of the U.S.-Taiwanese occupying forces and four other companies, and pursued and annihilated part of the bandit's 64th Army headquarters fleeing south from Jialai. On the 26th, our army occupied Chengmai city.

	The eastern route of our army landed in the area of Linshi Port and Shengyan Mountain, and first surrounded the 393rd Regiment of the enemy's 131st Division and part of the 457th Regiment of the 153rd Division in Huachang and Ma, north of Chengmai. At that time, the bandit army transported two regiments of its Provisional 13th Division by train from Haikou to reinforce them, and the 453rd Regiment of its 62nd Army's 151st Division reinforced from Ding'an. After the two bandit armies met in Fushan City, they organized the so-called "second line of defense" to confront our army. On the 18th, our army annihilated a part of the bandits north of Fushan City and occupied Fushan City. On the 21st and 22nd, our army again annihilated the 252nd Division headquarters and the 755th Regiment, and part of one battalion of the 754th Regiment in Meiting and Huangzhu. At the same time, we also repelled two regiments of the bandit's 62nd Army's 153rd Division who came to help from Bailianshi at the 105 Heights of Maocaoshan, north of Meiting. The bandit army, with the cooperation of land and air forces, launched thirteen consecutive assaults, but all failed. The remnants of the bandit's 64th Army's 131st Division, who were defeated on the coast and surrounded in Lingao, broke through to the south on the evening of the 22nd and were also intercepted and annihilated by our army. Lingao City was then liberated.

	At this point, the main forces of our eastern and western routes joined forces and went straight to the bandit's nest, Haikou, and occupied the city and Qiongshan county seat on the 23rd. On the 24th, our pursuing troops quickly liberated Wenchang, thus controlling the 400-plus-mile-long coastline in the east-west direction of northern Hainan Island.

	In the week-long seaborne operation, the 100,000 remnant bandits on the island relied on their sea, land, and air forces to deploy a three-dimensional defense, but under the heroic attack of our army, their defense quickly collapsed. Our army displayed a high degree of combat enthusiasm, and after conquering the ocean and heroically achieving landing in front of the enemy, they continued to endure extreme fatigue, overcome the difficulties of not being able to supply food and grass, and day and night, with skilled interspersion tactics, swept across the enemy's positions, and in a few days, completely shattered the enemy's point-line deep defenses, and successively captured Haikou, Qiongshan, Chengmai, Lingao, Wenchang, Meitai, Jialai, Fushan, Meiting and other towns. At present, the remnant bandits are crumbling and fleeing to the coastal areas of southern Qiong. Our army is cooperating with the Qiongya Column, crossing the peaks of the Wuzhi Mountains, chasing the fleeing bandits, and advancing rapidly towards southern Qiong. The liberation of the entire Hainan Island is not far off.

	Preliminary statistics of the battle results in the past week: The annihilation of the bandit 64th Army headquarters, the 391st, 392nd, and 393rd Regiments of the 131st Division, the 156th Division headquarters and the 466th Regiment, the 475th Regiment of the 159th Division, the 37th, 38th, and 39th Regiments of the Provisional 13th Division, the 453rd Regiment of the 151st Division, the 457th Regiment of the 153rd Division, and one battalion of the 459th Regiment, totaling 5,621 enemy troops. Among them, 1,311 officers and soldiers, including Wen Hong, Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army, were killed or wounded, and 4,310 officers and soldiers, including Chen Hantao, commander of the 39th Regiment, were captured. The seized items include three field guns, five infantry guns, fourteen mortars, twenty-one 60mm mortars, thirty-five heavy machine guns, one hundred and seventy-one light machine guns, one thousand one hundred and ninety-eight rifles and carbines, and sixty vehicles. Two enemy planes were shot down and two enemy ships were destroyed.

　　海南岛我军彻底粉碎敌纵深防御
    十万残匪呈土崩瓦解
    我军正越五指山向南疾进尾追溃匪
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】人民解放军第四野战军司令部顷发布海南岛战役第一阶段的作战公报称：
    我军一部为解放中南大陆，发起肃清琼崖残匪的渡海作战。我军系以两支强大部队由雷州半岛起渡，在琼崖纵队和我先批潜渡部队的配合下，于四月十七日清晨，粉碎敌陆海空军的联合防御，突破匪琼北沿海防线，胜利实现敌前登陆。
    西路我军在博铺港、临高角一带登陆，击溃匪海防部队六十四军一三一师之两个团并歼其一部后，十九日续歼美台守敌一五六师师部警卫营另四个连之大部，并追歼由加来南逃之匪六十四军军部一部。二十六日，我军即进占澄迈城。
    东路我军则在林诗港、圣眼山一带登陆，首于澄迈以北之花场、马两地一举将敌一三一师之三九三团及一五三师之四五七团一部加以包围。其时，匪军乃以其暂十三师之两个团由海口车运增援，其六十二军一五一师之四五三团则自定安增援。两路匪军在福山市会合后，即组织所谓“二线防御”与我对抗。十八日，我军在福山市以北歼灭匪一部，并进占福山市。二十一、二十二两日，我军又于美亭、黄竹两地歼匪二五二师师部及七五五团，七五四团一个营之一部，同时并在美亭以北之茅草山一○五高地击溃由白莲市出援之匪六十二军一五三师之两个团。匪军曾以陆空军配合，连续进行十三次冲锋，均未得逞。由海滨败退被围于临高之匪六十四军一三一师残部于二十二日晚突围南窜，亦被我截歼一部。临高城乃告解放。
    至此我东西两路大军会合并肩直取匪巢海口，二十三日进占该市及琼山县城。二十四日，我追击部队又迅速解放文昌，从而控制了海南岛北部东西长达四百余里的海岸线。
    在一周来的渡海作战中，岛上的十万残匪曾凭借其海陆空军，布置立体防御，但在我军的英勇的进击下，其防御迅即趋于崩溃。而我军则发扬了高度的战斗积极性，在征服海洋、英勇实现敌前登陆后，继又忍受了极度疲劳，克服了粮草接济不上的困难，昼夜不停地以熟练的穿插战术，纵横扫荡敌阵，数日间即彻底粉碎了敌军的点线纵深防御，连克海口、琼山、澄迈、临高、文昌、美台、加来、福山、美亭等城镇。目前残匪已呈土崩瓦解，纷向琼南滨海逃窜。我军正协同琼崖纵队，翻越五指山峰，尾追溃匪，向琼南疾进中。海南全岛解放已为期不远。
    一周来的战果初步统计：歼匪六十四军军部，一三一师之三九一团、三九二团，三九三团，一五六师师部及四六六团，一五九师之四七五团，暂十三师之三十七团、三十八团、三十九团，一五一师之四五三团，一五三师之四五七团、四五九团一个营等各一部，共计五千六百二十一名，其中毙伤匪六十二军参谋长温轰以下官兵一千三百一十一名，俘匪三十九团团长陈汉涛以下官兵四千三百一十名。缴获野炮三门，步兵炮五门，迫击炮十四门，六零炮二十一门，重机枪三十五挺，轻机枪一七一挺，步马枪一一九八支，汽车六十辆。击落敌机两架，击毁敌舰两艘。
