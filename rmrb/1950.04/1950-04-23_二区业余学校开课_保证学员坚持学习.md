　　Second District Amateur School Opens, Ensuring Students Persist in Learning
    [Our Newspaper] The Second District Amateur School of Beijing opened on March 31st. Twenty units are participating in the studies, including 796 industrial workers and cadres. There are three levels—elementary, intermediate, and literacy—with nineteen classes in three shifts, morning, evening. Classes are held in the morning at the Third Cultural Center and in the evening at Hongda Middle School. There are six full-time teachers and seven part-time teachers. There are also organizations such as the school committee, the academic affairs committee, the student committee, and mutual aid groups. Regarding the question of "how to ensure that students study regularly and persevere to the end," the school has taken the following steps: First, convene a joint meeting of the heads of each unit to discuss and explain the importance of this issue, and decide: 1. Establish a learning reward and punishment system to encourage learning enthusiasm. 2. Emphasize the learning system. As far as possible, do not let work, meetings, and other matters take up study time. 3. Call on new and old cadres to help each other, organize mutual aid groups, and increase the confidence of old cadres in learning culture. If one is absent, they can help each other make up the lesson. 4. The Party and Youth League branches play a promoting role. Second, establish a student committee. The student committee is composed of one or two people from each unit, who regularly supervise and inspect, grasp the learning situation, and keep in touch with the leaders of their unit and the school. Third, the time for students in each unit to attend class is allocated at the same appropriate time to take care of work.

　　二区业余学校开课  保证学员坚持学习
    【本报讯】京市二区业余学校已于三月三十一日开学。参加学习的单位共二十个，包括产业工人、干部等七九六人。分初、中、文盲三级十九班早晚三批上课。课堂早晨在第三文化馆，晚上在弘达中学。共聘有六位专任教员、七位兼任教员。并有校委会、教务会、学委会、互助组等组织。对“怎样保证学员经常学习、坚持到底”这一问题，该校采取了下列步骤：第一、召开各单位首长联席会议，讨论说明此问题的重要性，并决定：一、建立学习奖惩制度，鼓励学习情绪。二、强调学习制度。尽可能不把工作、开会等情事占据学习时间。三、号召新老干部互助，组织互助组，提高老干部学习文化信心。若万一缺课并可互相帮助补课。四、党、团支部起推动作用。第二、建立学委会。学委由每单位一、二人参加，经常督促检查，掌握学习情况，与本单位首长及校方随时联系。第三、各单位学员上课的时间分配在同一恰当的时间，以照顾工作。
