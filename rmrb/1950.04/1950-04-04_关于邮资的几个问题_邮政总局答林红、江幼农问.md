Regarding Several Questions about Postage
    Reply from the General Post Office to Comrades Lin Hong and Jiang Younong

Comrades Lin Hong and Jiang Younong:

    Thank you for your many valuable suggestions. A brief response is as follows:

    (1) Regarding the issue of issuing "real value" postage stamps, the National Postal Conference discussed it and solicited everyone's opinions. However, everyone believes that the Renminbi and postage stamps are both issued by the state, and the face value of postage stamps should still be based on the Renminbi. Moreover, the calculation units for "real value" vary from place to place and are not uniform, so it was decided not to change it.

    (2) Regarding the method of using the "Postage Paid" stamp instead of postage stamps, it is now being used in larger post offices across the country to handle large volumes of mail.

    (3) Regarding postage for manuscripts and printed matter, the manuscript rate is currently set at three-quarters of the letter rate, and the printed matter rate is calculated based on the lowest average freight cost in society. Compared to the cost, both rates are not high. In addition, there is a method of paying for scattered manuscript submissions in bulk, that is, manuscripts are sent without postage stamps; the postage due is paid uniformly by the newspaper office. Please inquire at local post offices for details.

    (4) Regarding the issue of announcing postage adjustments in advance, for the convenience of the public, we will try to publish the information in newspapers as early as possible in the future.

                                          Postal Administration, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications

　　关于邮资的几个问题
    邮政总局答林红、江幼农问林红、江幼农同志：
    谢谢你们提供的许多宝贵意见，兹简复如下：
    （一）关于发行折实邮票一事，全国邮政会议曾提出讨论，也征求了大家意见。但大家认为人民币与邮票同为国家发行，邮票面值仍应以人民币为本位；况折实计算单位，各地互异，并不统一，故决定不变更。
    （二）关于使用“邮资已付”戳记代替邮票办法，现在国内各较大邮局已在使用，盖收大宗邮件。
    （三）关于稿件及印刷品邮资问题，稿件资费现按信函类资费四分之三核订，印刷品系依社会最低平均运费计费，比照成本，两种资费均不为高。此外尚有稿件零寄整付办法，即寄送稿件，不贴邮票；应收邮资，由报社统一偿付，详情请询各地邮局。
    （四）关于提早发表邮资调整消息问题，为群众方便起见，嗣后当尽可能提早在报纸上发布。
                                          邮电部邮政总局启
