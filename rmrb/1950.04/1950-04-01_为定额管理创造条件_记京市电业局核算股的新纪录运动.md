　　Creating Conditions for Quota Management
    ——A Record-Breaking Movement in the Accounting Section of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    After liberation, the accounting section of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau (responsible for calculating electricity bills for users) continued to follow the old rules of the Kuomintang era. Regardless of your ability or proficiency, everyone was required to process 135 households per day, eight hours a day. In reality, those who were quick could finish in half a day. As a result, people chatted, made noise, and those who finished early went out to play during work hours. Because the work was slow and undisciplined, without attention to methods and techniques, some people couldn't finish during work hours and had to work overtime.

    Starting in December of last year, the bureau's leadership wanted to change this situation, but couldn't find a specific solution for a while. They simply suggested to everyone: we must break with egalitarianism, those who can do more should do more, and those who can't do as much can do less. However, the staff worried that efficiency improvements would lead to "layoffs," so some secretly agreed among themselves that no one should say they could do more. They even told the leaders: "To do more, you'd have to write fewer items on each form," "Even so, we suffer from lung problems every year; it would be unbearable for our health if we increased the burden." Some staff members expressed a desire to "break with egalitarianism" and devised a mutual aid method: those who were quick helped those who were slow to complete 135 households per day, and the credit was still given to the latter. This method failed after only a few days.

    Starting in 1950, the North China Electric Power Bureau decided that each branch bureau should implement a quota management system and gradually implement planned production. After planning and preparation by the Party, government, labor union, and youth league of the Beijing Bureau, a conference of more than 100 people, including worker representatives and cadres above the worker foreman level, was held in early February to earnestly convey and discuss the decisions of the higher authorities. Through this conference, the thinking of the employees was raised a step further. Everyone understood that they would not be unemployed due to increased work efficiency; on the contrary, each person's work ability would be used and developed more rationally. After the meeting, some advanced employees in various departments began to consider and plan how to improve work efficiency, reduce electricity losses and waste of materials, in order to reduce the cost of electricity sales and facilitate citizens' electricity use.

    In the accounting section, Communist Party member Wu Shufang first set a plan to complete 180 households per day, and also proposed that she would never chat or do anything other than production during work hours. She quickly achieved the planned figure—increasing from 135 to 180 households per day. At this time, some people nearby made sarcastic remarks, ridiculing and isolating her. However, the administration, Party, and Youth League continuously encouraged her. Wu Shufang not only steadily improved her personal performance, but also further helped others, sparking mass enthusiasm for competition. Young staff member Li Jizeng surpassed her with an even higher record. Wu Shufang saw that Li Jizeng's working method was good. When calculating, he entered four figures simultaneously—first- and second-class electricity, street light fees, and total electricity fees—which was twice as fast as calculating them separately. Wu humbly learned from him and studied with him, and everyone around them tried this new method. In this way, the number of people breaking records increased day by day. In less than a week, the efficiency of more than half of the people had improved. According to statistics at the end of February, the average performance of each person had increased from the original 135 households to 165 households, and by late March it had increased again to 195 households.

    Along with the creation of new records, the leadership organized everyone to summarize their experiences and tentatively study quotas based on new working methods. The meter reading section summarized ten work experiences. The most important of these are: to set individual production plans, actively control time at work; meter readers can pre-write electricity price quick reference tables; while knocking on doors or waiting for users to record, they can copy the month and day of the next household; explanations to users should be concise; rest for a few minutes after reading about a hundred households, organize the forms, and sharpen pencils. The meter reading section also initially discussed the basis for quotas from general work rules: meter readers need a quarter of an hour to copy the meter book and submit the previous day's meter book; it takes about an hour to travel to and from the work location; it takes one and a half hours to return to the bureau to calculate the electricity, make daily reports, and fill out accident reports; it is possible to work at the work site for five hours and fifteen minutes, each user needs one and a half minutes, and a total of 210 households can be completed. Based on the current work situation, everyone believes that the daily work quota for each person can be set at 220 households.

    The accounting section has also found preliminary rules based on the working methods of advanced individuals: it takes 18 minutes to calculate 65 households (ordinary electricity is neither too large nor too small); 70 minutes for copying; 20 minutes for auditing and stamping, collecting accounts and receipts, filling out daily reports, and submitting accounts. In total, it takes 1.48 minutes for 65 households, and 284 households can be completed in eight hours. Because this is the highest individual working speed, it cannot be used as a standard quota at present, but it is helpful for research and further improving work efficiency.

    Over the past two months, the accounting section has initially gained some experience in creating new records and tentatively implementing quotas. Everyone has gained confidence, and has also initially determined quotas for work quality, supplies consumption, and personnel. In particular, a new atmosphere has emerged in work attitude. The past situation of sloppiness, chaos, and perfunctory work has greatly changed. Now work is tense and responsible, and even a minute of time is grasped tightly. Many people are reluctant to leave their seats easily. Sometimes, when personal calls come, they ask the other party to wait until after work or on Sunday to talk. Because everyone often studies methods and exchanges experiences, they also feel closer to each other, unlike the past when their relationships were indifferent and they did not interact with each other. In the past, people often said: "The accounting section works all day hunched over desks, no one knows, it's burying people!" And now, the new records and new creations have caused a sensation throughout the entire electric power bureau. Individuals and collectives with good results have received glorious commendations. Even people with poor performance feel that: in this way, work has direction and hope, and talents will no longer be buried!

　　为定额管理创造条件
    ——记京市电业局核算股的新纪录运动
    本报记者  林沫
    北京电业局核算股（核算用户应缴之电费）在解放以后，还一直按着国民党统治时代的陋规，不管你的能力强弱和熟练程度，每人每天八小时一律作一百三十五户。但实际作起来，手快的半天就能作完。于是，大家在工作时间就闲谈，吵闹，先干完的出去玩。因为工作拖拉散漫，不讲究方法和技术，弄得有些人在工作时间作不完，还要额外加班。
    该局领导上从去年十二月开始想改变这种情况，但一时也找不出具体办法。只是向大家提出：要打破平均主义，能作的应多作，不能作的也可以少作。可是职员们顾虑效率提高以后要“裁员”，有些人就暗中互相约定，谁也不能说自己可以多作。对着领导人还说：“要多作除非每张表上少写几项”，“就这样还年年害肺病，再加重了身体可吃不消。”还有些职员表示要“打破平均主义”，自订了一种互助办法：由手快的帮助手慢的每天作够一百三十五户，成绩还是记在后者的名下。这办法实行没几天，就失败了。
    从一九五○年开始，华北电业局决定各分局要推行定额管理制，逐步实行计划生产。北京局党、政、工、团布置、准备后，在二月初，召开了工人代表、工人领班以上干部一百多人的大会，认真地传达和讨论上级的决定。经过这次大会，职工们在思想上提高了一步。大家了解到绝不会因工作效率的提高而遭到失业；相反的，对每人的工作能力会得到更加合理的使用与发挥。会后，各部门一些先进职工们都开始考虑和计划如何提高工作效率，减少电力损失和物料的浪费，以降低售电成本和便利市民用电。
    在核算股，党员吴淑芳首先订出每天完成一百八十户的计划，还提出自己在工作时间绝不闲谈，不作生产以外的事。她很快地便达到了计划的数字——由每天一百三十五户提高到一百八十户。这时，旁边也有些人说风凉话，讽刺和孤立她。但是行政、党、团不断地鼓励她。吴淑芳不但个人成绩有进无退，而且进一步帮助别人，带起了群众的竞赛热情。青年职员李继曾以更高的纪录超过了她。吴淑芳见李继曾的工作方法好，打算盘时把一、二级电度路灯费、合计电费等四个数目字同时打出，比分开计算快一倍。吴便虚心地向他学习，和他研究，周围的人都试用这个新方法。这样，突破纪录的人一天天增多。不到一星期，半数以上的人效率都提高了。到二月底统计，每人的平均成绩已由原来的一百三十五户增到一百六十五户，而到三月下旬又增高到一百九十五户。
    随着新纪录的创造，领导上组织大家总结经验，并根据新的工作方法试行研究定额。抄表部分曾总结出十条工作经验。其中最主要的是：要订个人生产计划，工作中主动掌握时间；抄表员可以预先写出电价速见表；在叫门或等用户的纪录时可复写出下一户的月、日；为用户解释问题要简明；每抄百户左右休息数分钟，整理表片，削铅笔。抄表部分并从一般工作规律中初步讨论出定额的根据：抄表员每天抄表本和交前一天的表本须一刻钟；往工作地点来回约一点钟；回局后统计电度，作日报，填事故报告单须一点半钟；在工作地可工作五点十五分钟，每个用户须一分半钟，共可作二百一十户。根据目前工作情况，大家认为每天每人工作定额可定为二百二十户。
    核算部分也根据先进者的工作方法找出了初步的规律：核算六十五户（普通电度不太大不太少者）用十八分钟；缮写用七十分钟；审核盖章、领账领收据、填日报交账等用二十分钟。总计六十五户用一点四十八分钟，八小时可作二百八十四户。因为这是个别最高的工作速度，目前尚不能作为标准定额，不过这对研究和进一步提高工作效率是有帮助的。
    核算股两个月来对创造新纪录和试行定额已初步摸到了一些经验，大家都有了信心，而且进一步对工作质量、用品消耗、人员等已初步得出定额。特别是在工作态度上产生了新的气象，过去那种散漫、混乱、应付差事的情形大为改变了。现在工作时紧张、负责，连一分钟的时间都抓得很紧，很多人都轻易不肯离座，有时私人打来电话，就要对方等下班后或星期日再谈。因为大家经常研究办法，交换经验，彼此也都觉得亲切了，再不像过去那样关系淡漠，互不往来。过去，常有人说：“核算股整天爬在桌子上工作，没人知道，是把人埋没了！”而现在，新纪录和新创造轰动了全电业局。成绩好的，个人和集体都得到光荣的褒奖。连成绩落后的人也都觉得：这么着，工作有了方向，有了希望，再也不会埋没人材了！
