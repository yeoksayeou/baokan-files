Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th. The education workers and teachers of primary and secondary schools in the Huaiyin Special District of Northern Jiangsu have persisted in education work in the disaster areas, enabling the students of primary and secondary schools in the district to not only continue their studies, but also combine their studies with production and disaster relief work to help their families solve many practical difficulties. Since last autumn, 95.5 percent of the primary schools in the district have persisted in teaching despite the severe famine, and the number of students in some areas has even increased. All secondary schools have persisted, and teaching is being carried out according to a certain schedule.

Huaiyin District is the most severely affected disaster area in northern Jiangsu. Some teachers had negative emotions due to the disaster situation. Most parents also thought, "In this kind of famine year, we don't even have food to eat, what's the point of studying?" However, the students are still actively demanding to study. In order to effectively persist in education work in the disaster area, the Education Department of the district, on the one hand, required county and district education administrative staff to go deep into the disaster area to grasp the specific situation, study ways to persist, and provide focused leadership; and organized disaster area education inspection teams in each county to help disaster area schools formulate plans to persist in learning, and use publicly funded funds in a focused manner to solve the specific difficulties of each school. On the other hand, they mobilized teachers in the disaster area to promote a high spirit of serving the people, and asked them to share weal and woe with the students and overcome difficulties together, and to persist in education work in the disaster area to the end. Therefore, the negative emotions of the teachers were overcome, and the confidence in persisting in work was established.

In terms of working methods, primary schools mainly adopted the method of "organizing production and combining teaching," organizing students into various production groups for production. For example, in the past semester, the 464 primary schools in Shuyang County produced 70,000 catties of grain and vegetables, picked 220,000 catties of grass, caught more than 37,000 catties of fish, and caught more than 700 weasels and rabbits; and carried out production such as spinning, accumulating fertilizer, picking pine nuts, and making wool窝 shoes, etc. The income was equivalent to more than 114,000 catties of grain, which not only solved the students' book expenses, but also partially solved the difficulties in the students' family lives. In terms of the allocation of time for learning and production, the main thing is to change the teaching methods. For example, adopt methods such as "half-day system," "every other day system," group teaching, and using early morning and evening time for learning. For example, Nanguan Primary School in Shuyang has a production activity class every day, led by the leaders of each production group, to carry out production. The grass picking and manure collection group uses the spare time before and after class to produce; the spinning group arrives early and leaves late, making the most of their time to produce. Some primary schools organize students who live far away from the school to take turns going to school, so that they can have some time to stay at home for production. This method has won the support of students' parents and the masses.

Secondary schools generally put forward the slogan of "production for self-salvation" to break the idea of some students' dependence on relief and pessimism and despair, and to promote the spirit of mutual assistance to solve the tuition and living problems of students with financial difficulties. For example, most of the students in Shuyang Middle School could not afford the vegetable money. After mobilizing everyone to grow vegetables, more than 100 people worked hard and harvested more than 20,000 catties of vegetables, which solved the vegetable money problem for one and a half semesters. Students from Suqian Middle School and Huaiyin Middle School do odd jobs such as repairing houses, building walls, grinding flour, and cooking, saving expenses and helping poor students solve tuition problems. Teachers and students of the Yunhe Rural Normal School donated more than 2,000 catties of miscellaneous grains to help poor students solve their food problems. In addition, with the effective use of people's student aid funds, and the adoption of decentralized teaching methods in areas with extremely severe disasters, most poor students can continue to study.

　　淮阴专区坚持灾区教育
    学生学习结合生产救灾解决家庭不少困难
    【新华社上海五日电】苏北淮阴专区的教育工作者和中、小学教师坚持灾区教育工作，使该区中小学学生，不仅继续学习，并且结合生产救灾工作，帮助家庭解决了不少实际的困难。该区自去秋以来，有百分之九十五点五的小学，在严重的灾荒中坚持了教学，部分地区学生数且有增加；中学全部坚持，按一定进度进行教学。
    淮阴区为苏北最严重的灾区，部分教师曾因灾情产生消极情绪；一般学生家长也认为“这种荒年，饭都没有吃，还念什么书”。但学生们仍积极要求学习。该区教育处为有效地坚持灾区教育工作，一方面要求县区教育行政工作人员深入灾区，掌握具体情况，研究坚持办法，作有重点的领导；并组织各县灾区教育视导组，帮助灾区学校订坚持学习计划，对公助经费作有重点的使用，解决各校具体困难。另一方面，动员灾区教师，发扬高度为人民服务的精神，要求与学生同甘苦、共患难，把灾区教育工作坚持到底。因此教师们消极的情绪克服了，坚持工作的信心确立了。
    在工作方法上，小学主要是采用“组织生产，结合教学”的方法，将学生组成各种生产小组，进行生产。如沭阳全县四百六十四个小学，在过去一学期中生产了粮食和菜蔬七万斤，拾草二十二万斤，捕鱼三万七千多斤，捕黄鼠狼、兔子七百多只；以及进行纺纱、积肥、拾松子、打毛窝鞋等生产，所得折粮十一万四千多斤，不但解决了学生们的书籍费用，并且部分地解决了学生家庭生活的困难。在学习和生产的时间分配上，主要是改变教学方式。如采取“半日制”、“隔日制”、分组教学和利用早晚时间学习等办法。如沭阳南关小学每天有生产活动课，由各生产组长带领全组学生进行生产，拾草拾粪组利用上课前、散学后的空隙时间生产；纺纱组则早到迟退，抓紧时间生产。有的小学组织距学校较远的学生轮流到校上课，使他们能够有一部分时间留在家里进行生产。这种办法深得学生家长和群众的拥护。
    中学一般是提出“生产自救”口号，以打破某些学生的依赖救济和悲观失望的思想，并发扬互助互济的精神，以解决经济困难的学生学费和生活问题。如沭阳中学的学生，多数学生缴不起菜金，经发动大家种菜，一百多人劳动生产的结果，收获了二万多斤菜，解决了一个半学期的菜金问题。宿迁中学、淮阴中学的学生，自己做修屋砌墙、磨面、煮饭等杂活，节省开支，帮助清寒同学解决学费问题。运河乡村师范师生献出二千多斤杂粮，帮助清寒同学解决伙食问题，再加上人民助学金的有效使用，和在灾荒极严重地区采取分散教学等办法，使大部清寒学生都能继续学习。
