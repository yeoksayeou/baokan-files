　　Cotton-Growing Hero Huang Yuanling

　　Huang Yuanling, a cotton-growing model worker from Rehe Province and an old hero with twenty-four years of cotton-growing experience, is from Laoye Temple Village, Linglongta District, Jianchang. In last year's production, the old hero helped lead everyone in planting cotton, which benefited the whole village. Although the crops were poor last year, no one in the village went hungry this year.

　　Laoye Temple is a natural village with thirty-three households. This village is an old cotton-producing area. Cotton has been grown for twenty years, but because the harvesting methods were not effective, although growing cotton was much better than growing crops in the fields, the villagers did not benefit much. In the most fruitful years, only one hundred and one or twenty catties of seed cotton were picked per mu. During the puppet Manchukuo period, there were exorbitant taxes and levies. Regardless of whether there was a harvest or not, "cotton tributes" were demanded. If people didn't pay, they would be beaten and detained. Thus, the villagers dared not grow cotton.

　　After liberation, the old hero often thought: "Now that we are masters of our own destiny, we should work hard, find ways to grow more cotton, harvest more cotton, and live a good life." From then on, the old hero was determined to improve cotton planting methods. He selected several plots of land to grow cotton, and according to the season and soil quality, he used various different methods to cultivate the cotton fields. He failed time and time again, but he was not discouraged. After three years of hard work, he finally succeeded. In good years on high-quality land, he could pick three hundred catties of seed cotton, and in ordinary years on medium-quality land, he could pick two hundred catties.

　　The year before last, after successfully researching cotton planting, last spring the government called on everyone to grow more cotton. The old hero convened a meeting of the masses (Huang Yuanling is the village party secretary), calling on everyone to grow cotton, and explained the cotton planting methods he had researched over the past few years to the villagers. Due to the influence of the puppet Manchukuo, almost all the villagers were worried about having to pay "cotton tributes". No matter what was said, the villagers were unwilling to grow cotton. After individual persuasion and another mass meeting, not many people volunteered to grow cotton. Lying on the kang, the old hero tossed and turned, thinking: some villagers are still worried. I must find a way to mobilize them to grow cotton and live a good life. Finally, he came up with a solution: he would guarantee to take the lead. Then, he convened a third mass meeting. The old hero said: "I planted three mu of cotton last year. This year, I will plant another two and a half mu. If you don't believe me, I will pay the cotton!" After saying this, most of the villagers understood and were willing to grow cotton. Then, someone asked: "Our village only has twenty-seven male laborers. It takes a lot of work to manage the cotton, and we won't be able to harvest it all. What should we do?" The old hero proposed: since our village has insufficient labor, we should organize the women as well. The men will take care of plowing, and the women will take care of thinning seedlings, topping, pruning vines, and picking cotton. Everyone agreed with this proposal. As a result, out of the thirty-three households in the village, twenty-eight households volunteered to plant fifty-three mu of cotton fields (the village has a total of three hundred and fifty-seven mu of land), forming seven male labor exchange groups and five female labor exchange groups. There were still five households in the village who were unwilling to listen to advice and refused to plant.

　　When it was time to plant cotton, the old hero carefully provided technical guidance, going to the fields to practically show those who didn't know how to plant cotton how to cultivate the land. Most of the villagers followed the old hero's instructions. Only one household, Han Guoshen, planted two mu of cotton. He felt that he had grown cotton before without such meticulous cultivation, and he still harvested cotton. He didn't want to bother with all that work! He didn't listen to the old hero's words and just casually cultivated the land a few times.

　　The people who listened to the old hero's words plowed six times and weeded five times from planting to harvesting, topped and pruned the vines according to the seasons, and harvested meticulously. The twenty-seven women in the village who had never cultivated cotton before all learned how this time. Many children even learned how to cultivate cotton.

　　After picking the cotton in the autumn, everyone felt that growing cotton had many benefits. Because the crops in the fields suffered from wind and flood damage, the yield was only 30%, with each mu yielding only one hundred and thirty catties of sorghum. The cotton fields harvested using the old hero's cotton-growing method yielded at least one hundred and forty catties of seed cotton per mu (because they suffered from wind and excessive rain). The cotton spun from this could be sold for more than seven hundred catties of sorghum. The villagers who grew cotton said: "This time we were right to listen to Old Huang! We will grow more next year!"

　　Han Guoshen, who didn't listen to the old hero's words, only picked forty catties of seed cotton per mu in the autumn. The cotton fields adjacent to his land, cultivated according to the old hero's cultivation methods, yielded one hundred and seventy catties of seed cotton per mu in the autumn. Han Guoshen regretted it. He said: "Not listening to Old Huang's words resulted in a loss of more than one hundred catties of seed cotton. Next year, I must listen to him. I will cultivate the land according to whatever Old Huang tells me!"

　　And what about those households that didn't grow cotton? Take Huang Yuanfeng for example. In the spring, the old hero persuaded him to grow two mu of cotton. He said: "Don't even mention it! If I grow cotton, what will I eat in the autumn!" No matter how much he was persuaded, he wouldn't listen. When the autumn harvest came, the difference was obvious. The women's director's two and a half mu of cotton were adjacent to his land. In the autumn harvest, she picked four hundred and thirty catties of seed cotton, which was exchanged for two thousand four hundred catties of sorghum. Huang Yuanfeng's two mu of land only yielded one hundred and fifty catties of sorghum.

　　These facts educated all the farmers in Laoye Temple Village. Old hero Huang Yuanling's prestige among the masses became even higher. The old hero was honorably elected as the chairman of the Laoye Temple administrative village. The villagers all proposed: listening to Old Huang, we must grow more cotton this year. According to preliminary statistics, Laoye Temple natural village alone will grow at least one hundred and forty-seven mu of cotton this year.

　　种棉英雄黄元龄
    热河省种棉劳模、种过二十四年棉花的老英雄黄元龄，是建昌玲珑塔区老爷庙村的人，今年五十四岁。在去年生产中，老英雄帮助领导大家植棉，使全村得了利；虽说去年庄稼歉收，大家今年也没挨着饿。
    老爷庙是个自然村，全村三十三户人家，这村是个老产棉区，二十年前就有种棉花的，因为揍收的不得法，虽说种棉花比大田强的多，老乡得利不很大，最丰收的年景，每亩棉田才捡一百一、二十斤籽棉。赶到伪满时候横征暴敛，不管收不收，也要“棉花干”，不给就打就押，这样老乡不敢种棉花了。
    解放后，老英雄就时常想：“自己的天下了，应该好好干，想法多种棉花，多收棉花，过好日子。”从这老英雄就下决心改进植棉方法，他选几块地种棉花，按季节、土质，用各种不同方法来收拾棉田，失败又失败，他也不灰心，下了三年苦功，结果成功了，上等地好年景就能捡三百斤籽棉，中等地平常年景也能捡二百斤籽棉。
    前年研究种棉成功，去年春天政府号召大家多种棉花，老英雄就召集群众开会（黄元龄是村支部书记），号召大家种棉，又把这几年研究种棉办法向老乡学说一遍。因有伪满的影响，老乡差不多都有怕要“棉花干”的顾虑，不管咋说老乡也不愿种。会后个别劝说，又开了一次群众大会，自报种棉花的还不很多。老英雄躺在炕上翻来覆去的想：还有些老乡有顾虑，要想法动员他们都种棉花，过好日子，最后想出了办法：自己下保证带头干。接着召开第三次群众大会，老英雄说：“我去年种三亩棉花，今年我再多种二亩半，你们不信，要棉花我给！”这样一说绝大多数老乡都想开了，愿意种棉花，接着就有人提出：“咱们全村才二十七个男劳动力，收拾棉花又费工，揍收不过来咋办？”老英雄提出：咱村劳动力不足，把妇女也组织起来，男的竟管榜趟，女的管间苗、掏尖、打蔓、捡棉花。这个提议，大家都挺同意，结果全村三十三户，有二十八户，自报愿种棉田五十三亩（全村共有三百五十七亩土地），组成七个男换工组，五个女换工组。村里还有五户没想开，咋劝他们也不种。
    种棉时候到了，老英雄很细心的进行技术指导，到地里实地告诉不会植棉的怎样收拾法。多数老乡都按照老英雄的话去作；只有一户叫韩国森的种二亩棉花，他觉着：从前种的棉花，没那样细致收拾，也收棉花，谁费那些工呢！他不听老英雄的话，只马虎的收拾几遍就算了。
    听老英雄话的人们，从种到收，搒六遍趟五遍，按节气掏尖打蔓，揍收的挺细致，全村从前不会收拾棉花的二十七个妇女，这回都学会了，有好多儿童都学会了收拾棉花。
    秋天捡完棉花，大家感觉到种棉好处多，因为受了风灾水害大田才三成年景，每亩地才打一百三十多斤白高粱，按老英雄的种棉法揍收的棉田最低还捡了一百四十斤籽棉（因为受了风灾、雨水多的害），弹成棉花能卖七百多斤白高粱。种棉的老乡说：“这回我们听老黄的话算听对啦！过年咱们要多种！”
    不听老英雄话的韩国森，到秋天一捡棉花，每亩才捡四十斤籽棉；和他地挨着的棉田，按照老英雄的耕作法去作，秋天一亩地捡了一百七十斤籽棉。韩国森后悔了，他说：“不听老黄的话少收一百多斤籽棉，过年说啥也得听话了，老黄告诉我咋揍收我就咋揍收！”
    再瞧瞧没种棉花的那几户吧！拿黄元凤来说，春天老英雄劝他种二亩棉花，他说：“你可别说啦！我种那些棉花，上秋我吃啥呀！”咋劝说他也不听。赶到秋收一比，可看出来了，妇女主任的二亩半棉花和他的地垅挨垅，秋收捡了四百三十斤籽棉，换了二千四百斤白高粱；黄元凤的二亩地才打一百五十斤白高粱。
    这些事实教育了老爷庙村全体农民，老英雄黄元龄在群众中的威信更高了，老英雄光荣的被选为老爷庙行政村主席，老乡都提出：听老黄的话，今年要多种棉花。初步的统计了一下，光老爷庙自然村今年最少要种一百四十七亩棉花。
