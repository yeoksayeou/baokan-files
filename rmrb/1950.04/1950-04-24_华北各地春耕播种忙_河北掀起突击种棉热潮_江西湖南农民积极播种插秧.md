Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Rural areas in various provinces of North China are widely launching a spring plowing and sowing campaign. After widespread spring rains around the Qingming Festival, the sowing campaign began. Farmers in some counties of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces are sowing spring grains, sorghum, and cotton. Cotton has been mostly planted in counties such as Linxian, Anyang, and Tangyin, and has been completely planted in Xinxiang County. Cotton planting has also begun in rural areas of Shanxi Province.

This year's spring plowing work in rural areas of North China provinces has generally been better than in previous years. Plowing, harrowing, hoeing wheat, and watering wheat have been more widespread than in previous years. Most of the spring fields that should be cultivated in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have been plowed, and spring cultivated land in most areas has been harrowed four to five times, and some villages have even harrowed more than seven times. As of the end of March, farmers in Shanxi Province had irrigated more than 1,725,000 mu of spring fields, exceeding the original plan by more than 70 percent. The rolling and harrowing of wheat fields in the Yuncheng and Fenyang areas of the province has ended. The entire province is now universally starting to hoe wheat. Farmers in four counties including Jiexian and Jiaocheng are applying top dressing to wheat fields. Farmers in various parts of Suiyuan Province are busy breaking up clods, repairing canals, and spring watering. Farmers in Naobao Village, Liangcheng County, have completed spring watering of 13,500 mu of land and have begun planting wheat.

During spring plowing, attention was also paid to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and the improvement of soil. Chahar Province universally promoted seed soaking and seed mixing. For example, 90 percent of the 31,000 mu of wheat planted in Chengguan District, Zhuolu County, was soaked. In order to eliminate the heartworm damage to grain seedlings, the province also launched a universal campaign to pick up grain stubble. Ni Village, Yangyuan County, organized more than 370 people to clear all the grain stubble in the village within four days. In order to improve the soil, villages in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, have launched a soil padding campaign, and put forward slogans such as "Red soil, greasy oil, and sand, nothing grows if it's up to them" and "Cover the soil with sand, and you will definitely harvest" to mobilize. Dazhai Village in the county padded 100 mu of land in half a month; farmers on both sides of the Zhanghe River have improved more than 2,000 mu of soil.

In order to better promote spring plowing and sowing, the leading organs at the provincial, regional, and county levels in North China have formed spring plowing inspection teams in early April, and have successively set off to rural areas to inspect and assist local people's governments in carrying out various tasks related to spring plowing and sowing. The Hebei and Shanxi inspection teams will focus on inspecting cotton planting work; the Suiyuan Province inspection team will focus on helping the masses solve difficulties in spring plowing to ensure that no land is left uncultivated.

[Report from this newspaper] After widespread rainfall, farmers in various parts of Hebei Province launched a surge in cotton planting. After it rained on the 16th in the counties of the Shijiazhuang area, the area immediately dispatched more than 630 cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in planting cotton. According to statistics on the 18th, Zhao County, Luancheng, Yuanshi, and Jin County in the area had planted 30,820 mu of cotton. On the 15th and 16th, Huolu County successively dispatched 100 cadres to the countryside to assist farmers in planting cotton. According to statistics from 23 villages in the first, eighth, and fifth districts of the county, all of which are dry land villages, the original plan to plant 6,350 mu of cotton has been expanded to 10,050 mu; the number of mu planted in ordinary villages in the eighth district has exceeded one-third or one-half of the original plan. In order to assist the area in completing the glorious task of planting 2 million mu of cotton, the North China Farm mobilized 80 technicians from the farm on the 15th to go to Zhengding, Huolu, Jin County, Yuanshi, and Pingshan counties to guide farmers in planting cotton. After it rained on the 15th in the counties of the Dingxian area, the masses in all counties in the area have now begun planting cotton. The Boye and Lixian county committees and governments also instructed all localities to launch a cotton planting campaign starting on the 18th. After the rain, five villages including Pan Village and Xipan in Dingxian County in the area have planted 1,200 mu of cotton; Dalu Village has increased cotton fields by more than one mu per household after the rain. Farmers in Wuji, Anping, Xingtang, Quyang and other places are also starting to plant cotton while the land is still wet. The counties in the Handan area have completed all preparations for planting cotton and have now entered a campaign to plant cotton quickly. After the rain, Handan, Wu'an, Linzhang, and Wei counties have planted 31,500 mu of cotton, with Handan County alone having planted 2,700 mu. The Communist Party branch of Feng Village in Lincheng County, Xingtai area, immediately mobilized the masses in the whole village to plant cotton after the rain. Eighty percent of the male labor force and 70 percent of the women in the village have now been organized to participate in the cotton planting campaign. Under the leadership of all party members and cadres, the farmers of Zhai Village in Xingtai County planted 41.5 mu of cotton in one day and completed all cotton fields within three days. The original plan of Huining Village in the county was to plant 380 mu of cotton. Under the leadership and mobilization of party members, the number of mu of cotton planted by each household has reached 1,200 mu. The original plan of Liufengtou Village in the three districts of Ningjin County was to plant 480 mu of cotton. Under the leadership of 17 party members in the village, 581 mu of cotton were planted within ten days, exceeding the cotton planting task by 20 percent. In the six and seven districts of Daxing County, Tongxian area, 21 villages have planted 1,500 mu of cotton within three days after the rain. Baimiao Village in the seventh district has completed 80 percent of its cotton planting task. After widespread rainfall on the 15th in the counties of the Baoding area, the special office instructed all counties to launch a cotton planting campaign from April 21st to May 10th to ensure the completion of the 1.3 million mu cotton planting task. Farmers in other counties such as Anci and Cangxian are also enthusiastically launching a cotton planting campaign under the help and leadership of party and government cadres at all levels.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 23rd: Farmers in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, famous rice-producing areas, have universally started spring plowing.

The spring plowing area in Jiangxi Province has reached 32.7 million mu. The vast number of farmers are actively engaged in the sowing and transplanting of early rice. Early rice has been completely sown in counties such as Fuliang. Rice seedlings in the Gannan area have emerged an inch or so from the water. In order to ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing, the Provincial People's Government issued a spring plowing production mobilization order at the beginning of this month. Nanchang, Shangyou, Nankang and other 43 counties also held people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences in early March, extensively publicized the production policies of the people's government, and stabilized the farmers' production mood in response to the various ideological concerns of the farmers. For example, after understanding the production policies of the people's government, the farmers in Shangyou County had cultivated nine-tenths of the county, and the better villages had done four ploughings and four harrows. While carrying out spring plowing, farmers in various places are also actively building dikes, canals, and ponds. The Poyang Lake dike project is now 92 percent complete. In addition, according to statistics from Nankang, Yujiang, Shangrao and other 16 counties, more than 3,200 ponds and more than 1,600 reservoirs have been built and dug, which provides an important guarantee for the completion of this year's provincial agricultural production increase plan.

Most of the rice fields in Hunan Province have been ploughed once, and some areas have completed two ploughings and two harrowings. Farmers in various places also soaked rice seeds around the Qingming Festival and began sowing and transplanting rice seedlings. Farmers in the province have recovered a large amount of rent grain during the rent reduction movement, and their production enthusiasm is very high. Farmers in the four areas of Changsha, Yiyang, Changde, and Hengyang alone received 1 million shi of rent reduction grain, most of which was invested in spring plowing. For example, Zhao Hesong, a tenant farmer in the fifth district of Changsha, recovered 24 shi of rent reduction grain and used 18 shi of grain to buy fertilizer. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has allocated 7 million jin of relief grain to farmers in disaster areas with more spring plowing difficulties to help farmers solve the difficulties of production materials in spring plowing, and called on farmers in non-disaster areas to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and lend surplus production materials to farmers in disaster areas. For example, farmers in non-disaster areas in the fourth district of Xintian County have lent a total of 2,400 jin of rice and sweet potatoes and more than 220 head of cattle, enabling 782 disaster-stricken households who were completely unable to carry out spring plowing to successfully carry out spring plowing.
