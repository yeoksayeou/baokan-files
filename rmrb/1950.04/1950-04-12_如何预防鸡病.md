　　How to Prevent Chicken Diseases

　　Common diseases that harm adult chickens include Newcastle disease, fowl plague (fowl pest), and fowl cholera. The former two are caused by filterable viruses, while the latter is caused by bacteria. It is often difficult to distinguish these diseases based on symptoms alone. If the head of a sick chicken can be carefully packaged and quickly sent to the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute for testing, the specific disease can be determined. Currently, the therapeutic effects of drugs for chicken diseases are still poor, so the most important thing is vaccination. Newcastle disease and fowl plague are prevented with vaccine immunization injections, which are effective for six months to one year. Fowl cholera is prevented with serum immunization injections, with an immunity period of about one to three months.

　　In the Hebei Province area, the most prevalent chicken disease is Newcastle disease. The technique for Newcastle disease immunization prevention injections is very simple and easy to learn. Simply use an ordinary needle, sharpened bamboo stick, or pen nib, dip it in a little vaccine, and slightly prick the skin under the chicken's wing three times, similar to vaccinating for smallpox. Injecting the vaccine under the skin will provide immunity. This method has been widely used in the Nanjing area and has achieved good results.

　　In addition to immunization for preventing chicken diseases, attention should also be paid to maintaining a clean, dry, and well-ventilated breeding environment. If chicken diseases occur, healthy chickens should be immediately moved to another location and isolated from the sick chickens. Other people and animals should also avoid contact with the sick chickens to prevent them from acting as carriers of the infection. Dead chickens are best buried deeply. If it is necessary to eat dead chicken meat, then the chicken blood, offal, intestines, feathers, and the water used to wash the chicken must be buried deeply, and never discarded randomly, so as to prevent the spread of the virus and expand the scope of infection. Chicken coops where chickens have died should be burned and not reused; otherwise, they need to be thoroughly disinfected and only reused after a period of one to two months.

### 如何预防鸡病

　　如何预防鸡病
    通常为害大鸡的病，有鸡新城疫、鸡百斯笃（瘟）和鸡霍乱。前两者是由于过滤性毒所致病，后者则由于细菌致病。这几种病在病状上区别较为困难。如果能将病鸡的头包装好，很快的送到华北农业科学研究所去检验，就可以确定是什么病。目前，鸡病药物治疗的效果还是很差，最重要的是打预防针。鸡新城疫、鸡百斯笃是用疫苗来作免疫预防注射，有效期半年到一年；鸡霍乱用血清来作免疫预防注射，免疫期约一月至三月。
    在河北省一带，流行的鸡病以鸡新城疫为多，鸡新城疫免疫预防注射的技术是很简单而容易学会的，只要用普通的针、削尖的竹签或钢笔头，醮一点疫苗，在鸡的翼下皮肤像种牛痘似的轻微的刺入三下，将疫苗接种在皮下，即可得到免疫力量。这种方法在南京一带已普遍应用而收到良好效果。
    除了免疫预防鸡病以外，更要注意饲养环境卫生、干燥、通风。遇有鸡病，应即严格的将好鸡移至他处，与病鸡隔离，其他人畜亦应不与病鸡接触，以免作传染的媒介。死鸡最好深埋；如一定要吃死鸡肉，则必须把鸡血、素食、肠子、鸡毛等及洗鸡用的水深埋，万不可乱丢，以免病毒散播，扩大传染范围。死过鸡的鸡窝要烧掉，不能再用；否则也需要彻底消毒，经过一、二个月的时间方可再用。
