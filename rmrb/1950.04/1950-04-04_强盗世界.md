　　A World of Robbers
    American newspapers report that a "serious" crime – such as assassination, robbery, etc. – occurs every nineteen seconds in the United States. According to a report by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the number of such "serious" crimes reached as high as 1,686,670 last year, the highest record in the past ten years.
    Last year, the *Miner* magazine published a series of essays under the frightening title of "Terror in Our Cities," discussing the development of crime in the United States. The author of these articles, Howard Whitman, pointed out an interesting fact: the main reason for the occurrence of crime is the negligence of the government authorities. In the United States, the police are not used to resist crime, but mainly to arrest progressive elements. Therefore, gang bandits and daylight robbers actively threaten the residents of large and small cities; even the capital is no exception. The *Washington Times-Herald* complained in an editorial:
    "What kind of world is this? No girl can ride a bicycle in the park on a sunny Sunday without being strangled. ... No woman can walk in the park during the day without being in danger of rape and assassination. ... A man cannot know his fate: whether he will only be robbed or even lose his life?"
    It would be difficult for anyone to find a better example to illustrate what the "American way of life" praised by Washington politicians is all about! (Zhen Xiong translated from *New Times* magazine, issue 7, 1950)

　　强盗世界
    美国报纸报导，在美国每十九秒钟内就会有一件“严重”的罪案发生——如暗杀、抢劫等。根据联邦调查局主任胡佛的报告，这样“重”罪案的数字在去年已高达一百六十八万六千六百七十件之多，为最近十年的最高纪录。
    《矿工》杂志在去年曾以很可怕的“恐怖在我们的城市中”为题，登载过一连串的论文，讨论犯罪在美国的发展情形。这些文章的作者霍华特·魏特曼指出了一件有趣味的事情：犯罪发生的主要原因，是由于政府当局的不注意。警察在美国不是用来抵抗犯罪的，而是主要地用来逮捕进步分子的。因此帮会匪徒和白昼行窃者就积极地威胁大小城市的居民；连首都也没有例外。华盛顿的“时事导报”在社论上控诉说：
    “这算是什么世界？没有一个女孩子在阳光和煦的星期日到公园内去骑脚踏车而不会被勒死的。……没有一个女人白天在公园里走而没有受强奸和暗杀的危险的。……一个男人也不能知道他的命运：光是被拦路行劫呢，还是连性命也要送掉？”
    任何人恐怕不易找出一个更好的例子来说明华盛顿政客们所颂扬的“美国生活方式”是怎么回事了！（镇雄译自“新时代”杂志一九五○年七期）
