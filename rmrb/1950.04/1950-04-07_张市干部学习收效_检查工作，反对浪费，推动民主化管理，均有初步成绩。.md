Learning to Manage Enterprises

　　Zhang City Cadre Study Yields Results
    Inspection of Work, Opposition to Waste, and Promotion of Democratic Management All Achieve Preliminary Results.
    [Report from this newspaper] After studying this newspaper's editorial "Learning to Manage Enterprises," cadres in enterprises and government offices in Zhangjiakou City have improved their work. This study began on March 1st. Before the study, the city held a mobilization meeting for cadres from all enterprises and government offices, and the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally took charge of forming a "Study Leadership Group" to provide regular guidance. In most units, the main responsible cadres gave enlightening reports. After personal reading, note-taking, and group discussions, they initially grasped the basic spirit of the document and then used it to examine their work and thinking in light of reality. The Communist Party branch of some units, in conjunction with conveying the Zhang City Party Congress's resolution on industrial production held in early March, convened a general meeting of party members (and absorbed workers and staff) to make reports, and then mobilized everyone to start inspecting work, collecting mass opinions, and drafting improvement measures. By the end of the first stage of study on March 20th, all units had identified many shortcomings in their work and began to improve, achieving preliminary results:

            Inventorying Warehouse Equipment, Adjusting Labor Organization
    In terms of opposing waste: For example, after the Transportation Company reviewed the fact that it lost 26,000 jin of millet during the period of internal system chaos last year, Manager Qi Zhenqing personally began to inventory the warehouse and cleared out more than 40 sets of "Chevrolet" rear axle bearings and more than 40 sets of brake hoses that the company urgently needed. These things had been bought from outside for a year, and they were bought the day before, and the quality of the bought ones was not as good as the inventory. The Xinsheng Mechanized Flour Mill inspected its labor organization, determined a responsibility system, and streamlined six of its twenty-one employees. It was also found that 22 to 25 jin of flour were not ground cleanly from every 100 jin of bran. It has now begun to find ways to improve production efficiency, and 39,000 jin of flour can be ground from bran every month, enough for the full wages of all 83 employees in the factory. The People's Equipment Factory reduced its electricity consumption by 1,420 candlepower for electric lights alone, saving more than 440,000 yuan per month. The Postal Bureau adjusted its labor organization and extracted nine people to take over the distribution of Hebei Province's newspapers, increasing revenue by 20,000 jin of rice per month.

            Starting to Implement Quota Management, Rectifying Various Management Systems
    In terms of implementing quota management: For example, the Postal Bureau's delivery of ordinary letters was four times faster than in February, express letters were one and a half times faster, and a new record of delivering letters to 300 to 400 households, traveling 30 miles, and taking 2 hours and 10 minutes was created. The bureau requires that errors be completely eliminated in April. In study and discussion, the Alcohol Factory has summarized the standard manufacturing process for the two main workshops of Qu Room and Saccharification and is continuing to develop the entire standard production process to determine quotas. The Transportation Company reviewed that in the past, only the mileage quota was implemented, and the consumption of load, fuel, and lubricating oil was not subject to quota management, resulting in "over-fulfillment" of mileage while consumption had no fixed standard, and some drivers developed a tendency to be unwilling to carry heavy loads, which has attracted the company's attention. In addition, the People's Building Materials Factory has begun to rectify various management systems, and the Xinsheng Flour Mill is stepping up the establishment of statistical work in order to further calculate costs and carry out quota management. The Electric Machine Factory studied the new wage policy and completed the democratic salary assessment work.

            Reviewing Shortcomings in Neglecting the Management Committee, Establishing the Idea of Relying on Workers
    This study has greatly promoted the implementation of democratic management. In the inspections of various units, it was found that the enterprise administrations generally did not pay enough attention to the management committee. A part of factories has not established management committees, and those that have established management committees are mostly just formalities, and the joint meetings of the Party, government, and labor union replace the management committee. The worker representatives in the management committee lack organized activities among the workers, so they cannot play their due role. At the same time, a part of factories found that in addition to establishing the management committee, they also need to establish the workers' representative congress to ensure that democratic management can be implemented. In its study, the Transportation Company relived the painful lessons of the losses incurred during the chaotic period last year and established the idea of relying on the workers, combining the workers' technology with the cadres' political leadership, overcoming many passive ideas that emphasized objective difficulties, and the business has made progress, and recent work has undergone rapid changes.
    
    Through this study, a part of the enterprise administrative responsible cadres who had progressed slowly in the past began to change. Wang Jingxuan (retained personnel), director of the Cigarette Factory, conducted self-criticism for the first time in the study and took the initiative to go to the secretary of the Communist Party branch of the factory and said, "I don't know how to do this. You have to always find ways for me." Pang Tingwei (retained personnel), director of the Electrical and Mechanical Factory, believes that this study is very important and requested that the study time be extended in the factory. The director of the Clothing Factory and the engineering and technical personnel of the Alcohol Factory used to have a gap between them and the workers. After the review and criticism of this study, there have been preliminary improvements.

            Correcting Study Deviations, Continuing In-depth Study
    At the beginning of this study, there were several deviations: One was that there were too many problems, the documents were difficult to understand, and they could not get into them; the other was that the content of the editorial was "ordinary and unremarkable," and they understood it at a glance, and they studied it perfunctorily. These have been initially corrected after the leading cadres made enlightening reports, the municipal party committee checked the notes, held tests, and issued circulars, so that the study can gradually deepen. However, there are still some shortcomings: the study gains of staff and technical personnel are not great, which also reflects that the work of uniting and transforming technical personnel is very weak; at the same time, the atmosphere of business and technical learning among veteran cadres is not strong. Some units spend more time on the wording of the articles and less time on checking and discussing in light of reality. In addition, the study of cadres in various government offices and production units is very poor.

    The city has decided to continue studying and continue to check work and combine it with the New Record Movement to expand the results of this study.

### 张市干部学习收效  检查工作，反对浪费，推动民主化管理，均有初步成绩。

　　张市干部学习收效
    检查工作，反对浪费，推动民主化管理，均有初步成绩。
    【本报讯】张家口市各企业、机关干部，学习本报社论“学会管理企业”后，工作已有所改进。这次学习是从三月一日开始的。学习前，该市曾召开全市企业、机关干部的学习动员大会；并由中共市委书记亲自负责组成“学习领导小组”经常指导。多数单位在学习中，由主要负责干部作了启发报告；经过个人阅读、写笔记、小组讨论等步骤，初步掌握了文件的基本精神之后，即依此联系实际，检查自己的工作和思想。有的单位的中共支部，并结合传达三月初举行的张市党代会关于工业生产的决议，召开了党员大会（并吸收工人、职员群众参加）作了报告，然后发动大家动手检查工作，搜集群众意见，拟具改进办法。至三月二十日第一阶段学习结束时止，各单位检查出了工作中的许多缺点，并着手改进，已获得初步成绩：
            清点仓库器材  调整劳动组织
    在反对浪费方面：如运输公司检讨了去年内部制度混乱时期损失二万六千斤小米的事实之后，经理齐镇青即亲自下手清点仓库，清出本公司所急需的“雪佛兰”后轴滚珠四十余套，刹车皮管四十余套。而这些东西，一年以来都在外面买，前一天还去买过，所买的质量不如库存的好。欣生机制粉厂检查了劳动组织，确定了责任制，二十一名职员中精简了六名。并发现每百斤麸皮中尚有二十二斤至二十五斤的面粉未磨净。现已着手设法提高生产效率，每月可从麸皮中磨出粉三万九千斤，足够全厂八十三人的全部工资。人民器材厂只电灯一项就减少了一千四百二十支烛光，每月节省四十四万余元。邮政局调整了劳动组织，抽出九人接办察省的报纸发行工作，每月增加收入二万斤米。
            开始实行定额管理  整顿各种管理制度
    在实行定额管理方面：如邮局的平信投递较二月份加速了四倍，快信一倍半，并创造了投信三百至四百户，行路三十里，费时二时十分的新纪录。该局要求在四月份完全消灭差错。酒精厂在学习讨论中，已总结了曲室、糖化两个主要车间的标准制造过程，并在继续制订全部的标准生产过程以确定定额。运输公司检讨了过去只有行车里程的定额，而载重、燃料、润油的消耗未实行定额管理，致使行车里程上虽出现“超额”而消耗无一定标准，并使部分司机产生不愿载重的偏向，这些已引起该公司的注意。此外，人民建筑制材厂已着手整顿各种管理制度，欣生制粉厂正抓紧建立统计工作，以便进一步核算成本、进行定额管理。电机厂学习了新的工资政策，完成了民主评薪工作。
            检讨轻视管委会缺点  树立依靠工人的思想
    此次学习，对实行民主化管理工作起了很大推动作用。各单位检查中，发现了相当普遍地存在着企业行政对管委会重视不足的缺点，一部分厂子尚未建立管委会，建立了管委会的亦多流于形式，而以党、政、工联席会代替了管委会；管委会中工人代表缺乏在工人中有组织的活动，因而不能起到应有的作用。同时，一部分工厂检查出除建立管委会外，还要建立职工代表会的工作，才能使管理民主化能贯彻执行。运输公司在学习中，重温去年混乱时期产生损失的痛苦教训，树立了依靠工人的思想，使工人的技术与干部的政治领导结合起来了，克服了许多强调客观困难的消极思想，业务上便有了办法，最近工作已有迅速转变。
    通过这次学习，一部分过去进步慢的企业行政负责干部开始有了改变。纸烟厂厂长王静轩（留用人员）在学习中初次进行了自我批评，并主动地去找该厂中共支部书记说：“这一套我不会，你要常常给我想办法”。机电厂厂长庞廷伟（留用人员），认为这次学习很重要，要求在该厂延长学习时间。被服厂的厂长与酒精厂的工务技术人员，过去都和工人之间存在着隔阂，经过此次学习的检讨、批评，都有了初步改善。
            纠正学习偏向  继续深入学习
    此次学习，开始时曾出现几种偏向：一种是认为问题太多，文件难懂，自己钻不进去；一种是认为社论内容“平凡无奇”，一看就懂，马马虎虎学一下就了事。这些，经过领导干部作启发报告；市委检查笔记，举行测验与发通报等之后，已初步纠正，使学习能逐步深入。但目前还存在一些缺点：职员与技术人员的学习收获不大，这也反映出团结改造技术人员的工作很薄弱；同时，老干部的业务、技术学习空气尚不浓厚。有些单位在条文字句上花的时间多，而联系实际检查讨论较少。此外，各机关干部与机关生产单位的学习很差。
    该市已决定继续学习，并继续检查工作与结合新纪录运动，以扩大此次学习成果。
