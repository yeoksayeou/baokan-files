Rural Spring Scenery

       I

    Warm breezes carry the scent of plum blossoms,
    The village is filled with lively sounds.
    Making adobe bricks, mixing mud,
    Humming and hawing, ramming the earth hard.
    Over here, shouts to raise the pillars,
    Over there, calls to set the beam.
    Liberated peasants have a good life,
    Mutual aid and cooperation build new houses!

           II

     Big yellow ox, sleek and shiny,
    Pulling manure carts all over the fields.
    One trip, two trips, then three,
    Three carts, five carts, then a dozen more.
    Erxiao's whip cracks loudly,
    Heini tightly grips the ox's reins.
    Next to the water pit comes a pitchfork wagon,
    Speaking and laughing, he starts up:
    "Brother Erxiao, let's see who pulls faster!"
    "Don't brag! I'm still better than you, black girl!"

           III

    Little donkey, like iron blue,
    Pulls the waterwheel like a whirlwind.
    Watering early, topdressing with manure,
    Everywhere, wheat seedlings are lush and green.
    Younger brother leads the animal, older sister watches the rows,
    The fields are filled with laughter.
    "Sister, sister, quickly block the opening,
    The flood is going to wash away the field ridge!"
    "Brother, brother, don't shout,
    Listen to me sing 'The East is Red'."

           IV

    Spring warms the earth, loosening the soil and stirring the yang energy,
    A sixty-year-old grandpa plows the cotton field.
    Grandson leads the animal, grandpa guides the plow,
    Participating in labor brings true joy,
    "Little one, little one, lead well,
    When the cotton is harvested, we'll exchange it for a new dress."
    "Grandpa, grandpa, don't worry,
    When I grow up, I'll drive a tractor!"

　　农村春色
       一
　
    阵阵暖风李花香，
    村中一片吵嚷嚷。
    打土坯，合泥浆，
    哼啊，哎呀，砸大夯。
    这边喊竖柱，
    那边喊上梁。
    翻身农民光景好，
    互助合作盖新房！
　
           二
　
     大黄牛，水溜溜，
    拖着粪车遍地走。
    一趟两趟连三趟，
    三辆五辆十几辆。
    二小的鞭子劈拍响，
    黑妮紧扯牛缰绳。
    水坑旁边来叉车，
    连说带笑开了腔：
    “二小哥，看谁拉的快！”
    “甭吹！怎也比你黑丫头强！”
　
           三
　
    小毛驴，似铁青，
    拉起水车赛旋风。
    早浇水，顶上粪，
    遍地麦苗绿葱葱。
    弟赶牲口姐看畦，
    田野一片欢笑声。
    “姐姐，姐姐，快堵口，
    大水要把畦堰冲！”
    “弟弟，弟弟，你别喊
    听我唱个《东方红》。”
　
           四
　
    春暖地松翻阳气，
    六十岁的大爷耕棉地。
    孙牵牲口爷扶犁，
    参加劳动真欢喜，
    “小娃，小娃，好好牵，
    收了棉花换花衣。”
    “爷爷，爷爷，别着急，
    长大我使拖拉机！”
