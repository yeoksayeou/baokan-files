Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd—The work of inspecting and clearing materials in Xi'an's public factories has been launched. When the Industry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee conducted a preliminary inspection of the Xi'an People's Power Plant in mid-March, it discovered that the plant had over 30 types of unused materials in stock, and also found several thousand kilograms of various iron materials in the scrap. To this end, the Industry Department convened a joint meeting of relevant personnel from its 12 factories on March 22 to discuss issues such as materials clearing and reasonable allocation. The heads of each factory also made separate reviews of the phenomenon of stockpiled materials. Northwest Textile Factory No. 1 reported that it had 93 kinds of infrequently used materials stockpiled, as well as 280,000 catties of waste cotton. The meeting also conducted a preliminary inspection of the account books of each factory, and the results showed that unused materials and excessive inventory amounted to approximately 1.4 million standardized units. The meeting required each factory to conduct a thorough clearing and inspection of these wasteful phenomena, and to improve the old management system in a timely manner. The meeting also decided that each factory should complete the clearing work by the end of April.

　　西安市公营工厂展开清理物资工作
    【新华社西安二日电】西安市公营工厂检查、清理物资的工作业已展开。西北军政委员会工业部于三月中旬在西安人民电厂进行初步检查时即发现该厂积压不用料品有三十余种，并在废料中查出各种铁料数千公斤。为此，工业部乃于三月二十二日召开所属十二个工厂有关人员联席会议，讨论物资清理及合理调配等问题。各厂负责人对积压物资的现象亦分别作了检讨。西北纺织一厂报出了所积压的不常用物料有九十三种，另有废棉二十八万斤。会议并就各厂帐册初步进行检查，结果发现不用物料和超额的库存物资，为数约合一百四十万个折实单位。会议要求各厂针对这些浪费现象进行彻底清理、检查，及时改善旧的管理制度。会议并决定各厂限于四月底完成清理工作。
