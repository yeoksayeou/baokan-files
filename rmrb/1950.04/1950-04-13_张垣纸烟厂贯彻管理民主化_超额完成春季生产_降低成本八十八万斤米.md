　　Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory Implements Democratic Management
    Exceeds Spring Production Target
    Reduces Costs by 880,000 Jin of Rice
    [Our Newspaper] In the new record movement for production and thrift, the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory exceeded the first quarter's production target by 13% and saved costs equivalent to over 880,000 jin of rice. The reason for the factory's above-mentioned achievements is primarily due to summarizing last year's work, clarifying that waste was the main problem in past production, and thus deciding on the correct policy of carrying out a production and thrift movement this year. In the movement, the Party, government, and labor union closely cooperated to lead production and made key breakthroughs by going deep into the workshops, educating the broad masses of workers with vivid facts, and promoting the widespread development of the movement. In order to give play to the production enthusiasm of the working class, democratic management was implemented, the management committee was re-elected, and "Zhuge Liang" meetings were held to absorb the workers' valuable opinions. Closely following the development of the movement, new quota targets were proposed in a timely manner, so that productivity could be fully utilized. For example, in January, it was stipulated to run seven machines, producing ninety cases per day, with each machine producing 12.85 cases; in February, it was increased to running eight machines, producing 105 cases per day, with each machine producing 13.125 cases. In order to ensure the smooth connection of production in each workshop, a workshop contact contract was signed under the leadership of the labor union. At the same time, the labor union strengthened production mobilization work, and through various publicity methods such as blackboards, good news reports, red flags, slogans, and writing congratulatory letters, it promptly commended achievements and introduced experiences; in addition, the commendation circular from the Municipal Party Committee and the awards from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Provincial and Municipal Governments strongly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. Currently, the factory's employees are studying the second quarter's production and thrift plan, striving to further reduce costs.

　　张垣纸烟厂贯彻管理民主化
    超额完成春季生产
    降低成本八十八万斤米
    【本报讯】张垣纸烟厂在生产节约新纪录运动中，超额完成第一季生产任务的百分之十三，并节省成本八十八万余斤米。该厂获得上述成绩的原因，首先是由于总结了去年的工作，明确了浪费是过去生产上的主要问题，因而决定了今年开展生产节约运动的正确方针。在运动中，党、政、工密切配合领导生产，并深入车间作重点突破，以活的事实教育广大职工，推动了运动普遍开展。为发挥工人阶级的生产积极性，贯彻管理民主化，改选了管理委员会，召开“诸葛亮”会议，以吸收工人的宝贵意见。紧随运动的发展，及时提出新的定额目标，使生产力得充分发挥，如一月份规定开七台车，日产九十箱，每台车合一二·八五箱；二月份则增为开车八台，日产一○五箱，每台车合一三·一二五箱。为保证各车间生产互相衔接，在工会领导下，订立了车间联系合同。同时工会并加强生产鼓动工作，通过黑板报、喜报、红旗、标语、写贺信等多种宣传方式，及时表扬成绩，介绍经验；加之市委的通报表扬和市工会及省市政府的奖励，都有力的鼓舞了工人的生产热情。现该厂职工正在研究第二季生产节约计划，争取再进一步降低成本。
