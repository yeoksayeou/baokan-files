The Hangu No. 2 Factory of the North China Chemical Company
    Overfulfills Spring Production Target, Saving Materials Equivalent to 400,000 Jin of Rice
[Our Newspaper] The workers of the Hangu No. 2 Factory of the North China Chemical Company under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, have demonstrated high levels of production enthusiasm during the production and economy campaign. By the end of March, they had produced 27,691 barrels of sodium sulfide, exceeding the original target by 11%. In terms of raw material usage, the factory saved 226 tons of anhydrous sodium sulfate alone compared to last winter, equivalent to 410,000 jin of millet. The achievement was mainly due to the trade union’s clarification of the orientation towards production, playing a powerful role in promoting and guaranteeing production. After the administration assigned production tasks, the trade union widely launched propaganda and deliberation work, mobilizing workshops and groups to formulate guarantee plans based on actual production conditions. At the same time, trade union groups were reorganized according to production units and nature to facilitate mutual supervision and inspection among workers. To promote production and boost morale, the trade union used big-character posters and loudspeakers to report production progress daily, commend model workers, and introduce successful experiences and lessons learned from failures. More importantly, the trade union adopted a leadership method of breaking through at one point. For example, the sodium sulfide department of the No. 2 Factory had its production affected by a lack of unity among workers, with daily output in January being 10 barrels less than that of the No. 3 Factory. Based on this situation, the trade union first announced the production figures and then, in conjunction with representatives, held individual talks with Li Mingjun, the group leader of the fourth group of the factory’s trade union, and Kong Qingxi, the production officer, using the facts of the No. 3 Factory to educate them. After that, the production volume of the No. 2 Factory began to increase. In the overall evaluation for the three months, the output of the fourth group was the highest. The trade union then used big-character posters and broadcasts to announce the changes in the fourth group, to promote competition among other groups and workshops.
    The trade union attached great importance to the promotion of workers' advanced experience. For example, Yu Enbo, an old worker of the No. 2 Factory, with more than 20 years of work experience, proposed that the use of dilution method could precipitate impurities earlier and increase production. After several tests by the third shift, the results were good, but some workers still did not trust it. The trade union, together with the administration, convened a joint meeting of heads and officers of various shifts and groups, to promote and explain it, and decided to test it in the No. 3 Factory for five days. As a result, the daily output suddenly increased from 180 barrels to 197 barrels.
    However, in this campaign, the connection between the Party, government, trade union, and youth league of the factory was still not close enough, the inspection system could not keep up with the requirements of the campaign, and in particular, the reward system had not been determined, which prevented the workers' enthusiasm and creativity from being fully utilized. These shortcomings should be corrected quickly. (Zhang Qingquan, Han Ruyin)

　　华北化学公司汉沽二厂
    超额完成春季生产任务  节省材料折米四十万斤
    【本报讯】重工业部华北化学公司汉沽二厂职工，在生产节约运动中，发挥了高度的生产积极性，至三月底，共生产硫化碱二七六九一桶，超过原任务百分之十一。在使用原料上，仅无水芒硝一项，就较去冬节省二二六吨，折合小米四十一万斤。这一成绩的获得，主要是工会明确了面向生产的方针，发挥了有力的推动和保证生产作用。当行政布置生产任务后，工会就广泛地展开了宣传酝酿工作，发动各车间小组，结合实际生产情况，订立保证计划。同时，依照生产单位和性质重新划分工会小组，以便工友间互相督促检查。为推动生产，鼓舞情绪，工会利用大字报及广播器等逐日报导生产进度，表扬工作模范，介绍成功经验与失败教训。更主要的是工会采用了突破一点的领导方法，如二工厂硫化碱部，因工友间不够团结，影响了生产，一月份每日产量较三工厂少十桶。根据这种情况，工会首先公布了生产数字，又结合代表，找该工厂工会第四组长李鸣俊、生产干事孔庆喜等进行个别谈话，以三厂的事实进行教育，此后二厂生产量即开始增加。三个月总评中，以第四组产量为最多。工会又利用大字报和广播公布了四组转变的情况，以推动其他小组和车间，普遍展开了竞赛。
    工会十分重视工人先进经验的推广，如二工厂老工人于恩波有二十来年的工作经验，他提出用稀释法可以提前析出杂质，增加产量的建议，并经第三班数次试验，成绩良好，可是部分工人仍不信任。工会即会同行政召开各班组长干事联席会，加以宣传说明，并决定在三工厂试验五天，结果日产量由一八○桶突增为一九七桶。
    但该厂在运动中，党、政、工、团联系仍不够密切，检查制度跟不上运动的要求，特别是奖励制度没有确定，致使工人积极性与创造性未能充分发挥。这些缺点，应迅速得到纠正。（张庆铨、韩汝荫）
