　　Niu Hongqi Leads the Emergency Repair of a Dangerous Embankment
　　Shunheying Village in the seventh district of Dingxing County, Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, is located north of the Doumen River. In recent years, silt has accumulated at the bottom of the river. Every year, even a slight rise in water levels turns the thirty-plus villages downstream, including Langou and Zecheng, into flooded areas.
　　The task of blocking the upstream floodwaters was undertaken by the farmers of Shunheying Village. Initially, some people in the village couldn't see things clearly and felt they shouldn't be meddling in this "unnecessary business." They said, "The water doesn't flood our village, and if we can't block it, our village will be the first to suffer. It's a complete waste of effort." In response to this selfish and short-sighted thinking, village chief Niu Hongqi (a Communist Party member) and all the village cadres worked hard to explain and mobilize, finally persuading the farmers. At the beginning of March this year, when the water rose, the whole village built water-blocking dikes section by section along the river north of the village. Everyone worked in shifts, persisting for five days and five nights.
　　On the sixth day, the situation improved. Everyone went home to eat a "relieving" meal. Niu Hongqi, only half-full, still felt uneasy and immediately ran to the embankment to inspect it. Alas! The embankment had been breached by the water, and the river was pouring in fiercely. Niu Hongqi shouted loudly while throwing himself down at the breach. The water washed him away twice, but he still went forward, desperately trying to block it. By the time everyone arrived, Niu Hongqi was already dazed from being battered by the water.
　　On March 16th, a fierce wind and heavy rain caused the water to rise rapidly, making the situation extremely dangerous. Niu Hongqi led everyone in building dikes overnight, finally stopping the river water that had risen three feet overnight. This spirit of putting the people's interests first, disregarding personal safety, protected tens of thousands of acres of farmland and was praised by the farmers of the thirty-plus villages downstream. The Dingxing County People's Government has already commended him.

### 牛洪起带头抢修险堤

　　牛洪起带头抢修险堤
    河北省保定专区定兴七区顺河营村村北靠斗门河，近年来河底泥土淤积，每年稍一涨水，下游兰沟、泽城等三十余村，就变为水区。
    堵住上流涨水的任务，是由顺河营村的农民担任的。起初该村有些人思想搞不通，总觉得不该管这“闲事”。他们说：“水又淹不着咱村，要是堵不住，咱村首先吃亏，真是白费劲。”针对这种自私自利不顾大局的想法，村长牛洪起（共产党员）及全体村干部努力解释动员，终于把农民都说服了。今年三月初水涨起来了，全村农民在村北河上一节节的垒起了挡水埝，大家轮流工作，坚持了五天五夜。
    第六天，情势好转。大家都回家去吃口“松心”饭。牛洪起吃了半饱，总觉放心不下，立即跑到堤上去察看。呀！堤岸已被水冲开了一个缺口，河水汹涌进来。牛洪起一面大声叫嚷，一面横身躺在决口地方，河水两次冲走了他，可是他仍然上前死命堵住。等大家都赶到时，牛洪起已被水打得昏昏沉沉了。
    三月十六日狂风暴雨，水势涨得很快，情形十分危险。牛洪起带领着大家连夜打埝，终于堵住了一夜上涨三尺的河水。这种为人民利益，不顾个人生命的精神，保护了万亩良田，受到了下游三十余村农民的赞扬。定兴县人民政府已予表扬。
