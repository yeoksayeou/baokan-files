Who Led the May Fourth Movement?
    Deng Tuo

    Recently, I reviewed some questions regarding the New Democracy studies in Beijing's secondary and higher education institutions. Among these, the primary questions were "Who led the May Fourth Movement?" and "Was the May Fourth Movement merely a cultural movement, or was it a political and ideological anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement?" Those participating in the studies urgently requested answers to these questions. Today, April 28th, marks the 23rd anniversary of the martyrdom of Comrade Li Dazhao, one of the outstanding leaders of the May Fourth Movement. In five days, we will commemorate the 31st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. On such a solemn and significant day in the history of the Chinese revolution, I would like to address the questions raised in the current studies and, in doing so, commemorate the great martyr Comrade Li Dazhao.

    The May Fourth Movement of thirty years ago was an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement based on the united front of communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals, with communist intellectuals as the leading backbone. This is an indisputable historical fact.

    The fifth issue of the fifth volume of "New Youth," published on October 15, 1918, prominently featured "Three Speeches on the European War." The first of these was a speech by the great Chinese communist Comrade Li Dazhao, entitled "The Victory of the Common People." Following these three speeches was another important essay by Comrade Li Dazhao, entitled "The Victory of Bolshevism." These two articles had a profound impact and caused alarm among the reactionary ruling class, leading to the arrest of Chen Duxiu, the editor of "New Youth." These two articles represented the basic position and viewpoint of Chinese communists at the time regarding Chinese and world issues.

    In his speech "The Victory of the Common People," Comrade Li Dazhao pointed out that the European war was a war between "Great...isms" (Note: The text lists Great Germanism, Great Asianism, etc.) and democracy; and the war within our country was also a war between "Great...isms" (Note: The text lists Great Northernism, Great Southwesternism, etc.) and democracy. He analyzed that "the real cause of this war is the development of capitalism." That is, because "the government of capitalists wants to rely on war... to seek benefits for their domestic capitalist class," it triggered "social revolutions by laborers in Russia, Germany, and other countries... to prevent this war of the capitalist government." He pointed out that "the victory of democracy is the victory of the common people"; "the victory of laborism is also the victory of the common people." Comrade Li Dazhao used "the war of democracy" and "the victory of the common people" to express the early thinking of Chinese communists regarding the people's democratic revolution.

    In the article "The Victory of Bolshevism," he further clarified that "the victory over German militarism" "is the victory of socialism, the victory of Bolshevism, the victory of the red flag, the victory of the world's working class, and the victory of the new trend of the twentieth century." He introduced the ideology of the Russian Bolshevik Party, "which is revolutionary socialism." "Their goal is to break the national boundaries that are currently obstacles to socialism and to break the production system that is monopolized by capitalists." "They oppose war, but they are not afraid of war." "Their war is a class war, a war of the world's proletariat against the world's capitalists." "They will unite the world's proletariat and create a free homeland with their strongest resistance."

    In the final paragraph of this article, Comrade Li Dazhao analyzed the then-current revolutionary upsurge in various countries around the world, saying:

    "Hungarian and Austrian revolutions, German revolution, Bulgarian revolution; recently, there have also been rumors of revolutionary socialist parties rising up in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Spain... Such a surging tide cannot be prevented by the current capitalist governments. Because the mass movement of the twentieth century unites all of humanity into one large mass... In the midst of this global mass movement, historically residual things, such as emperors, nobles, warlords, bureaucrats, militarism, capitalism—anything that obstructs the path of this new movement will be destroyed with the force of thunder. When they encounter this irresistible tide, they will fall to the ground one by one like withered leaves in the face of a biting autumn wind... The alarm bell of humanity has rung! The dawn of freedom has appeared! Look at the future of the globe, it will surely be a world of red flags! The Russian revolution is just a falling leaf that startles the world and signals the beginning of autumn. The word Bolshevism was created by the Russians, but its spirit is the spirit of common awakening in the hearts of all people around the world in the twentieth century. Therefore, the victory of Bolshevism is the victory of the new spirit of common awakening in the hearts of all people around the world in the twentieth century!" This was the most politically guiding document on the eve of the May Fourth Movement, which marked the beginning of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. The significant historical shift of the Chinese revolution from the nature of bourgeois old democracy to the nature of proletarian world revolution, which was part of the New Democratic Revolution, was fundamentally explained in Comrade Li Dazhao's article.

    The linking of the Chinese revolution in colonies and semi-colonies with the world revolution marked a new era. As Lenin said in his article "On the Economics of Imperialism" before the October Revolution, "Social revolution cannot but be an epoch in which the civil war of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie in the advanced countries is combined, in a single stream, with a whole series of democratic and revolutionary movements, including national liberation movements in undeveloped countries that are oppressed and underdeveloped." Stalin also said in his article "The October Revolution and the National Question" published in Pravda on November 6, 1918, "The October Revolution put an end to the old bourgeois national liberation movements and opened a new era of socialist movements of workers and peasants of oppressed nations. The spearhead of this movement is directed against all oppression (including national oppression), against the power of one's own and foreign bourgeoisie, and against imperialism in general." "The October Revolution was the first revolution in the world. It broke the long slumber of the laboring masses of the oppressed nations of the East and plunged them into the struggle against world imperialism."

    As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy," "The May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at the time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin," referring to this situation.

    The First World War and the victory of the Russian October Revolution had a profound impact on the Chinese people and the Chinese revolution. During the European war, China's capitalist industry had an opportunity for development. When the European war began in 1914, there were only 242 new-style enterprises in China; by the end of the European war in 1918, the number had increased to 342. Although the increase was less than one-third, it was of great significance to China's national capital. The strength of the Chinese working class also increased in proportion to this development. The world revolutionary movement, marked by the Russian October Revolution, further pointed out a new path for the liberation of the Chinese people. Chinese communists had already issued the call for "democratic warfare" and "the victory of the common people." At this time, news came that the diplomacy of the Chinese Beiyang warlord government had completely failed at the Paris Peace Conference, which was controlled by imperialism. It immediately aroused great anger among the Chinese people. The vigorous May Fourth Movement erupted like a volcano.

    The initial specific goals of the movement were to oppose the imperialist spoils-sharing conference and secret diplomacy; to demand the abolition of the Twenty-One Demands unequal treaty signed by Japanese imperialism and the traitorous government of Yuan Shikai; to oppose the Paris Peace Conference's complete transfer of all privileges and property of German imperialism in Shandong, China, to Japanese imperialism; and to oppose the pro-Japanese faction's control of the Beiyang warlord traitorous government. The large-scale demonstrations by Beijing students beginning on May 4th, beating traitors, resisting the suppression of the Beiyang warlord traitorous government's military police, implementing general strikes, and rapidly developing into widespread mass movements of workers, students, factory owners, and merchants striking, boycotting classes, boycotting markets, and banning Japanese goods in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places after June 3rd, was this not clearly the first great political struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism?

    The political guidance publication at the time was "Weekly Review." In the twenty-second issue of the publication, Comrade Li Dazhao published a commentary entitled "Secret Diplomacy and the Robber World." He pointed out the need for "the spirit of national self-determination and world transformation" and the need to "overthrow this robber world." He put forward "three great oaths," namely, "Transform the robber world! Refuse secret diplomacy! Implement national self-determination!" Then, in the twenty-third issue of "Weekly Review," another author, with the title "The Spirit of the May Fourth Movement," continued to elaborate on Comrade Li Dazhao's views, explaining that "this movement is the spirit of national self-determination." He emphasized, "We Chinese people have been suffocated by the oppression of strong countries and the oppression of violence. When should we decide for ourselves in this era of liberation if not now?!" All of this proves that the May Fourth Movement was clearly a political movement guided by the ideology of national democratic revolution.

    Initially, only patriotic intellectuals participated in the May Fourth Movement; after June 3rd, the broad working class, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie participated. This movement was based on the united front of communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals, with communist intellectuals as the leading backbone. This is not only a conclusion proven by history, but also a fact that those who participated in the May Fourth Movement admitted long ago. Let's look at Hu Shih's own self-analysis:

    "When I returned to China in July 1917 (Republic Year 6)... I made up my mind not to talk about politics for twenty years, wanting to build a foundation for innovation in Chinese politics through ideology and literature. In December 1918, my friends Chen Duxiu and Li Shou Chang launched Weekly Review, which was a newspaper that talked about politics, but the articles I did in Weekly Review were always novels and literature, never talking about politics." (Hu Shih's Collected Works, Second Series, "My Forked Road")

    This is very clear. As a representative of the right-wing bourgeois intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih was so afraid, passive, and wavering about real politics and the revolutionary movement of the people, that he stood far away, standing on a "forked road." "Making up his mind not to talk about politics for twenty years" precisely proves that he not only did not dare to lead and could not lead this revolutionary movement, but also initially simply did not dare to participate in it. Only the representatives of communist intellectuals, launching Weekly Review and talking about politics, were the actual leaders who were recognized in this revolutionary movement.

    However, no matter how Hu Shih and others avoided politics, politics would find them; the revolutionary movement of the people forced them to express their attitude. Therefore, when the May Fourth Movement broke through the circle of intellectuals and expanded into a national revolutionary movement, that is, after June 3rd, the political face of the right-wing bourgeois intellectuals represented by Hu Shih was exposed. Hu Shih continued in the above-mentioned article: "It was not until mid-June 1919, when Duxiu was arrested and I took over Weekly Review, that I felt that I could not but talk about politics." But he criticized the "new elements in the country at that time, who talked about Guild Socialism and Marxist Socialism every day, and talked about class warfare and surplus value." He said, "I couldn't stand it anymore, I couldn't help it, because I was a believer in experimentalism, so I was determined to talk about politics. I waited for two years and eight months, and Chinese public opinion still greatly disappointed me." Therefore, he wrote an article entitled "Study More Problems and Talk Less About Isms" in the thirty-first issue of Weekly Review on July 20, 1919, ridiculing all "talk about isms" as "something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do." What he considered to be "urgent problems of immediate concern" were "from the livelihood problems of rickshaw pullers to the authority problems of the president; from prostitution problems to selling official posts and selling the country problems; from dissolving the Anfu Clique problem to joining the League of Nations problem; from women's liberation problems to men's liberation problems," and so on. And for all these social problems, he did not advocate a "fundamental solution." He believed that "a fundamental solution" was "a death sentence for social reform." This was because Hu Shih himself held a vulgar "experimentalism," representing the weak bourgeoisie, and advocated "gradual reformism."

    In order to refute Hu Shih's fallacy, Comrade Li Dazhao sent an open letter to Hu Shih from Changli Wufeng. This letter was published in the thirty-fifth issue of Weekly Review on August 17 of the same year. He pointed out that "the solution of a social problem must rely on the joint movement of the majority of people in society to have any hope of being solved," "otherwise, even if you study your social problem, the majority of people in society will have nothing to do with it, and that social problem will still have no hope of being solved." "Therefore, our social movement, on the one hand, must study practical problems, and on the other hand, must publicize ideal isms, which are used in conjunction with each other." "We cannot stop our righteous propaganda just because the Anfu Clique also talks about socialism. Because there are people who are counterfeiting brands, we should promote our isms and study various problems, and carry out practical movements based on isms." "There must be a fundamental solution before there is any hope of solving specific problems one by one." "And before a fundamental solution, there must be considerable preparatory activities." In this letter, Comrade Li Dazhao, in response to the weaknesses of the May Fourth Movement, called loudly for doing "the practical movement of worker unions."

    This was the beginning of the division within the united front in the later period of the May Fourth Movement. Weekly Review stopped publishing. Communist intellectuals went deep into the struggle of workers and peasants; while Hu Shih and others increasingly went down the "forked road."

    Precisely because the May Fourth Movement was a great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement led by communists in politics and ideology, it was able to simultaneously become a thorough anti-feudal cultural movement. In those years, the most bravely smashing the Confucian shop, advocating literary revolution, and supporting democracy and science were still communist intellectuals, not others. This is also a fact that has long been recognized, and we might as well also quote Hu Shih's words as proof. He said:

    "The advocacy of literary revolution was initially just a few private discussions. It was not until January of the sixth year of the Republic of China that it was officially published in a magazine. The first article, Hu Shih's 'Tentative Proposals for Literary Reform,' was still a peaceful discussion. Hu Shih's attitude towards literature has always been an attitude of historical evolution. Later, his 'On Historical Literary Concepts' said it in more detail. Hu Shih himself often said: 'His historical obsession is too deep, so he is not worthy of doing revolutionary undertakings.' The most important vanguard in the progress of the literary revolution was Chen Duxiu. Chen Duxiu followed 'Tentative Proposals for Literary Reform' and published an 'On Literary Revolution,' officially raising the flag of literary revolution." (Hu Shih: Fifty Years of Chinese Literature)

    Obviously, Hu Shih's articles such as "Tentative Proposals for Literary Reform" and so-called "eight nos" were at most "peaceful discussions," an "attitude of historical evolution," that is, "gradual reform," that is, vulgar "experimentalism." Precisely because of this, Hu Shih's superficial claims on literature are not enough to explain the progressive content of Chinese new literature after the May Fourth Movement.

    Now history has made a conclusion, people like Hu Shih are not only "not worthy of doing revolutionary undertakings," but have also gone from their "forked road" to a dead end. Only Chinese communists, who have always consistently been loyal to the cause of the people's democratic revolution, are the true revolutionary leaders; the martyrs who gloriously died for this great revolutionary cause are immortal!

### 谁领导了五四运动？

专栏：

　　谁领导了五四运动？
    邓拓
    最近看了北京中等以上学校在新民主主义学习中的一些问题。其中，第一类问题就是“谁领导了五四运动”、“五四运动仅仅是一个文化运动还是在政治上、思想上反帝反封建的革命运动”等等。对于这些问题，参加学习的人，都迫切要求解答。今天，四月二十八日，恰值五四运动卓越的领导人之一李大钊同志死难二十三周年的纪念日。再过五天就是五四运动三十一周年的纪念日。在中国革命史上这样悲壮伟大的日子，我愿就当前学习中所提出的问题，作如下的论述，并借以纪念伟大的先烈李大钊同志。
    三十年前的五四运动，是以共产主义知识分子、革命小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子的统一战线为基础，而以共产主义知识分子为领导骨干的反帝反封建的革命运动。这是无可争辩的历史事实。
    一九一八年十月十五日出版的《新青年》第五卷第五号，曾以首要的地位刊登《关于欧战的演说三篇》；其第一篇就是中国伟大的共产主义者李大钊同志的演说，题目是《庶民的胜利》。在这三篇演说之后，紧接着的是李大钊同志写的另一篇重要论文，题目是《布尔什维克主义的胜利》。这两篇文章影响极大，并使当时的反动统治阶级为之惊慌失措，下令逮捕《新青年》的编辑人陈独秀。这两篇文章，代表了当时中国共产主义者对于中国问题和世界问题的基本立场和基本观点。
    李大钊同志在《庶民的胜利》的演说中指出：“欧洲的战争是“大……主义”（注：文中曾列举大日耳曼主义、大亚细亚主义等）与民主主义的战争；我们国内的战争，也是“大……主义”（注：文中曾列举大北方主义、大西南主义等）与民主主义的战争”。他分析“这回战争的真因，乃是资本主义的发展”。这就是说，由于“资本家的政府，想靠着大战……为自己国内资本家一阶级谋利益”，因此引起了“俄、德等国内劳工……起了社会革命，防遏这资本家政府的战争”。他指出“民主主义战胜，就是庶民的胜利”；“劳工主义战胜，也是庶民的胜利”。李大钊同志是以“民主主义的战争”和“庶民的胜利”来表达中国共产主义者对于人民民主革命的早期的思想。
    在“布尔什维克主义的胜利”一文中，他进一步指明“对于德国军国主义的胜利”，“是社会主义的胜利，是布尔什维克主义的胜利，是赤旗的胜利，是世界劳工阶级的胜利，是二十世纪新潮流的胜利”。他介绍俄国布尔什维克党的主义，“就是革命的社会主义”。“他们的目的，在于把现在为社会主义的障碍的国家界限打破，把资本家独占利益的生产制度打破”。“战争固为他们所反对，但是他们也不恐怕战争”。“他们的战争是阶级战争，是合世界无产庶民对于世界资本家的战争”。“他们将要联合世界的无产庶民，拿他们最强的抵抗力，创造一个自由乡土。”
    李大钊同志在这篇文章的末段，分析当时世界各国革命高潮的形势说：
    “匈、奥革命，德国革命，勃牙利（注：即保加利亚）革命；最近荷兰、瑞典、西班牙也有革命社会党奋起的风谣。……像这般滔滔滚滚的潮流，实非现在资本家的政府所能防遏得住的。因为二十世纪的群众运动，是合世界人类全体为一大群众。……在这世界的群众运动的中间，历史上残余的东西，什么皇帝咧、贵族咧、军阀咧、官僚咧、军国主义咧、资本主义咧，——凡可障阻这新运动的进路的，必挟雷霆万钧的力量摧灭他们。他们遇见这种不可当的潮流，都像枯黄的树叶遇见凛冽的秋风一般，一个一个的飞落在地。……人道的警钟响了！自由的曙光现了！试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界！……俄国的革命，不过是使天下惊秋的一片桐叶罢了。布尔什维克主义这个字，虽为俄人所创造；但是他的精神，却是二十世纪全世界人类人人心中共同觉悟的精神。所以布尔什维克主义的胜利，就是二十世纪世界人类人人心中共同觉悟的新精神的胜利！”这是作为中国新民主主义革命开端的五四运动前夜，具有最鲜明的政治指导性的文献。中国革命从资产阶级的旧民主主义的性质，变为无产阶级世界革命一部分的新民主主义革命的性质，这个重大的历史的转变，在李大钊同志的文章中已经有了基本的说明。
    殖民地半殖民地的中国革命和世界革命联结起来，这是一个新的时代。正如列宁在十月革命前发表的“论帝国主义的经济主义”一文中所说的：“社会革命的发生，不能不是把先进国度内无产阶级反对资产阶级的国内战争，和不发展的、落后的与被压迫的民族中一整串民主的和革命的运动（民族解放运动也在内）联结起来的一个时代”。斯大林于一九一八年十一月六日在真理报上发表的“十月革命与民族问题”一文中也说过：“十月革命结束了旧的资产阶级的民族解放运动，而开辟了一个被压迫民族工人和农民的社会主义运动的新纪元。这一运动的锋芒，是在于反对一切的压迫（民族压迫也在内），反对自己的与异族的资产阶级的政权，反对一般帝国主义”。“十月革命乃是世界上的第一次革命。它打破了东方被压迫民族劳动群众的长期沉睡，把他们卷入在反对世界帝国主义的斗争中了。”
    毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中所说，“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的”，就是指的这种情形。
    第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命的胜利，对于中国人民和中国革命的影响，显然是极为深刻的。欧战期间，中国资本主义的产业得到了一个发展的机会。一九一四年欧战开始的时候，中国新式的企业只有二四二家；一九一八年欧战结束时增至三四二家。虽然增加不到三分之一，但是，这对于中国的民族资本却有着重大的意义。中国工人阶级的力量，也随着这个发展的比例而更加增长了。以俄国十月革命为标志的世界革命运动，更指示了中国人民解放的新道路。中国共产主义者又已经发出了“民主主义战争”和“庶民胜利”的号召。就在这个时候，中国北洋军阀政府的外交，在帝国主义所把持的巴黎和会上彻底失败的消息传来了。它立即激起了中国人民极大的愤怒。轰轰烈烈的五四运动就像火山一样爆发了。
    运动最初的具体目标是反对帝国主义的分赃会议和秘密外交；是要求取消日本帝国主义和袁世凯卖国政府所订立的二十一条不平等条约；是反对巴黎和会将德帝国主义在中国山东的一切特权及财产全部让渡于日本帝国主义；是反对亲日派控制的北洋军阀卖国政府。从五月四日开始的北京学生的大示威，痛打卖国贼，抵抗北洋军阀卖国政府军警的镇压，实行总罢课，而迅速发展到六月三日以后上海、天津、武汉及其他各地工人、学生、厂主、商人的纷纷罢工、罢课、罢市和禁止日货的广泛的群众运动，这是中国人民第一次反帝反封建的伟大政治斗争，难道还不明显吗？
    当时的政治指导刊物是《每周评论》。在该刊第二十二期上，李大钊同志发表了一篇评论，题目是“秘密外交与强盗世界”。他指出要有“民族自决、世界改造的精神”，要“把这强盗世界推翻”。他提出了“三大信誓”，即是“改造强盗世界！不认秘密外交！实行民族自决！”接着在“每周评论”第二十三期上，另一位作者以“五四运动的精神”为题，继续阐述了李大钊同志的观点，说明“这次运动，是民族自决的精神”。他强调地说：“我们中国人，外受强国的压制，内受暴力的压制，已经奄奄无生气了。当这解放时代不能自决，还待何时？！”这些都证明了五四运动是很明确地以民族民主革命的思想为指导的政治运动。
    参加五四运动的，最初只有爱国的知识分子；六月三日以后，就有广大的工人阶级、小资产阶级和资产阶级参加。这个运动是以共产主义知识分子、革命小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子的统一战线为基础，而以共产主义的知识分子为领导的骨干。这不但是历史所证明了的结论，而且是当年参加五四运动的人们所早已承认的事实。请看胡适之自己的剖白吧：
    “一九一七年（民六）七月，我回国时……打定二十年不谈政治的决心，要想在思想文艺上替中国政治建筑一个革新的基础。一九一八年十二月，我的朋友陈独秀、李守常等发起每周评论，那是一个谈政治的报，但我在每周评论做的文字，总不过是小说文艺一类，不曾谈过政治。”（胡适文存二集《我的歧路》）
    这就很明白了。作为五四运动的右翼的资产阶级知识分子的代表，胡适，对于现实的政治，对于人民大众的革命运动是那样害怕、消极、动摇，而站得远远的，站在“歧路”上。“打定二十年不谈政治的决心”，恰恰证明了他对于这个革命运动，不但是不敢领导和不能领导，而且最初简直是不敢参加的。只有共产主义知识分子的代表，发起每周评论，谈政治，才是在这个革命运动中被公认的实际领导者。
    但是，不管胡适之等怎样躲避政治，而政治却要找到他们的头上；人民大众的革命运动，逼使他们不能不表示态度。因此，当着五四运动突破了知识分子的圈子，扩大成为全国范围的革命运动的时候，即在六月三日以后，以胡适之为代表的右翼资产阶级知识分子的政治面目，就暴露出来了。胡适之在上述文章中接着说：“直到一九一九年六月中，独秀被捕，我接办每周评论，方才有不能不谈政治的感觉”。但他却指责当时“国内一班新分子，天天高谈基尔特社会主义与马克思社会主义，高谈阶级战争与赢余价值”。他说：“我看不过了，忍不住了，因为我是一个实验主义的信徒，所以发愤要想谈政治。我等候了两年零八个月，中国的舆论，仍然使我大失望”。于是，他在一九一九年七月二十日的每周评论第三十一期上写了一篇“多研究些问题少谈些主义”的文章，讥讽一切“谈主义”的都是“阿猫阿狗都能做的事”。他所认为是“火烧   眉毛的紧急问题”，乃是“从人力车夫的生计问题到大总统的权限问题；从卖淫问题到卖官卖国问题；从解散安福部问题到加入国际联盟问题；从女子解放问题到男子解放问题”等等。而对于这一切社会问题，他是不主张“根本解决”的。他认为“根本解决”即是“社会改良的死刑宣告”。这是因为胡适之自己抱着一个庸俗的“实验主义”，代表着软弱的资产阶级，主张“一点一滴的改良”主义。
    为了驳斥胡适之的谬论，李大钊同志从昌黎五峰寄给胡适之一封公开信，这封信发表于同年八月十七日每周评论第三十五期。他指出“一个社会问题的解决，必须靠着社会上多数人共同的运动，才有解决的希望”，“不然，你尽管研究你的社会问题，社会上多数人却一点不发生关系，那个社会问题，仍然没有解决的希望”。“所以我们的社会运动，一方面要研究实际问题，一方面要宣传理想的主义，这是交相为用的”。“不能因为安福派也来讲社会主义，就停止了我们正义的宣传。因为有了假冒牌号的人，我们愈发应该宣传我们的主义，并研究种种问题，本着主义去做实际的运动”。“必须有一个根本的解决，才有把一个一个具体问题都解决了的希望”。“而在根本解决以前，还须有相当的准备活动”。在这封信上，李大钊同志针对五四运动的弱点，大声疾呼要做“工人联合的实际运动”。
    这就是五四运动后期统一战线内部分化的开始。每周评论停止发行了。共产主义知识分子深入到工人、农民群众的斗争中去；而胡适之等人则日益走入“歧路”了。
    正因为五四运动是由共产主义者在政治上思想上领导的反帝反封建的伟大革命运动，因此，它才能够同时成为一个彻底的反封建文化的运动。当年最勇猛地打倒孔家店、提倡文学革命、拥护民主和科学的仍然是共产主义的知识分子，而不是别人。这同样是早已被公认的事实，而且我们也无妨同样引用胡适之的话来作证明。他说：
    “文学革命的主张，起初只是几个私人的讨论。到民国六年一月，方才正式在杂志上发表。第一篇胡适的《文学改良刍议》，还是很和平的讨论。胡适对于文学的态度，始终只是一个历史进化的态度。后来他的《历史的文学观念论》说的更详细。胡适自己常说：“他的历史癖太深，故不配做革命的事业。”文学革命的进行，最重要的急先锋是陈独秀。陈独秀接着《文学改良刍议》之后，发表了一篇《文学革命论》，正式举起文学革命的旗子。”（胡适：五十年来之中国文学）
    很显然的，胡适的《文学改良刍议》之类的文章和所谓“八不”之类的“主义”，充其量不过是“很和平的讨论”，是“历史进化的态度”，即“一点一滴的改良”，即庸俗的“实验主义”。正因为这样，胡适在文学上的浅薄的主张，决不足以说明五四以后的中国新文学的进步内容。
    现在历史已经作了定论，像胡适之流，不但“不配做革命的事业”，而且已经从他的“歧路”走到死路了。只有始终一贯地忠于人民民主革命事业的中国共产主义者，才是真正的革命领导者；为这个伟大的革命事业而光荣死难的先烈是永垂不朽的！
      一九五○年四月二十八日
