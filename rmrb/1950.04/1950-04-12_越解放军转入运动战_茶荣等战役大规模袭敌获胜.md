Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 11th: According to a military communique, in the past year, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army in the 7th War Zone of Southern Vietnam killed 3,500 French troops and auxiliary forces, killed 42 French officers, wounded 1,400, captured 600, and shot down 8 French aircraft and sank 6 inland river vessels. The Vietnam Liberation Army captured 240 machine guns, 4 artillery pieces, and hundreds of rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 11th: "Voice of Vietnam" radio commented on the evening of the 8th on the recent victory of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army against French troops in Tra Vinh Province, south of Saigon. In this battle, the Liberation Army annihilated 1,000 French troops and destroyed more than 20 enemy bunkers. "Voice of Vietnam" believes that this battle is the realization of a recent mobile warfare strategy. General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army, strongly urged the implementation of this mobile warfare strategy at a military conference held at the beginning of this year. "Voice of Vietnam" pointed out that the Battle of Tra Vinh is one of a series of large-scale attacks on French troops this year. Prior to this, brilliant victories had also been achieved in Po Lou and Hoa Binh in northwestern Vietnam, and in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien in central Vietnam. The radio station concluded that the victory of these battles is not only due to the maturity of the local army, but also to the close cooperation between the army, the people, and the administration. These battles clearly prove President Ho Chi Minh's prediction that he made at the beginning of this year: "1950 will be a year of great victory."

TASS, Paris, April 11th: The newspaper "Le Temps" published news of the operations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's army in Vietnam, stating that the issue now is no longer isolated and scattered attacks by guerrillas, but powerful and concentrated offensives by the People's Liberation Army using modern weapons.

"L'Humanité" pointed out that the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has intensified its activities near Hanoi, and its patrols have also become more active in the southeast region of Haiphong.

Vietnam News Agency reported that in recent weeks, the Lao People's Liberation Army has also been very active in northern Laos. The Lao People's Liberation Army recently repelled a French military offensive against the liberated areas. The enemy suffered more than 40 casualties.

　　越解放军转入运动战
    茶荣等战役大规模袭敌获胜
    【新华社十一日讯】越南通讯社南越六日讯：据军事公报宣称，越南人民解放军去年一年在越南南部第七战区的作战中，共击毙法军及辅助部队三千五百人，击毙法军军官四十二人，击伤一千四百人，俘虏六百人，击落法国飞机八架，击沉内河船只六艘。越南解放军共缴获机枪二百四十挺，大炮四门，步枪数百支。
    南越第七战区一年歼敌五千
    【新华社十一日讯】“越南之声”电台于八日晚评论越南人民解放军最近在西贡以南茶荣省对法军的袭击胜利。在这次战役中，解放军歼灭法军一千人，摧毁敌人碉堡二十余处。“越南之声”认为，这次战役是最近一次运动战的实现。越南人民解放军总司令武元甲将军在今年初召开的一次军事会议上，曾力促进行这种运动战。“越南之声”指出：茶荣之战是今年来对法军一连串大规模袭击中的一次。在此以前，在越南西北部的坡鲁与和平，中越的广平、广治及承天，也曾获得光辉的胜利。该电台结语称：这些战役的胜利，不仅是由于地方军的成熟，而且也是由于军队、人民及行政上的密切合作。这些战役清楚地证明了胡志明主席的预言，他在今年年初说：“一九五○年将是伟大胜利的一年。”
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：时代报刊载越南民主共和国军队在越南作战的消息称，现在的问题已经不是游击队个别分散的袭击，而是人民解放军用现代化的武器作有力而集中的进攻了。
    人道报指出：越南民主共和国军队已在河内附近加紧活动，其巡逻队在海防东南区域的活动也更益加紧。
    越南通讯社报道，近数周来，老挝人民解放军在老挝北部也非常活跃。老挝人民解放军最近曾击退了法军对解放区的一次进攻。敌军损失四十人以上。
