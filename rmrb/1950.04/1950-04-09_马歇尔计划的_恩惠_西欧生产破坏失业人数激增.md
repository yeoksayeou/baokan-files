　　The "Favor" of the Marshall Plan
    Western European Production Damaged, Unemployment Soars
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch] The official, greatly reduced unemployment figures released by Western European Marshall Plan countries demonstrate the falsity of the American-propagated "European recovery." In France, unemployment in December of the year before last was 98,000. In December of last year, it increased to 153,000 (actually 500,000). In Italy, unemployment in October of the year before last was 1.48 million, increasing to 1.5 million in October of last year, and further to 1.52 million in January of this year (actually 3 million). In Britain, which receives the most Marshall Plan funding and claims "full employment," unemployment in January of this year was 370,000, more than 70,000 higher than when the Marshall Plan began, an increase of nearly one-quarter. In Belgium, unemployment in January of this year was 390,000, compared to 300,000 a year ago. In the Netherlands, unemployment increased by 16,000 in the year from October of the year before last to October of last year, and increased by more than 50,000 from October of last year to February of this year. In Finland, unemployment doubled from January of last year to January of this year. In Norway, unemployment increased by one-fifth during the same period. In tiny Denmark, with a population of just over four million, unemployment reached 70,000 in January of this year, an increase of about one-sixth compared to a year ago. In Sweden, unemployment increased by more than one-quarter from November of the year before last to November of last year. In West Germany, under direct American control and so-called "uncompensated aid," unemployment reached more than 2 million in February of this year, an increase of more than 1 million compared to a year ago.
    It is clear from this that one of the results of the "favor" of the Marshall Plan is the widespread increase in unemployment in "recipient" countries. The reason is simple: according to the bilateral agreements under the Marshall Plan, these countries must import grain and goods from the United States that they were originally able to produce themselves, thus inevitably damaging the production of these countries and leading to unemployment.

### 马歇尔计划的“恩惠”  西欧生产破坏失业人数激增

　　马歇尔计划的“恩惠”
    西欧生产破坏失业人数激增
    【新华社七日讯】西欧马歇尔计划国家官方发表的大大缩小了的失业数字，说明美国宣传的所谓“欧洲复兴”的虚伪性。法国前年十二月的失业是九万八千人。去年十二月增加到十五万三千（实际上是五十万人）。意大利前年十月失业是一百四十八万人，去年十月增加到一百五十万，今年一月又增到一百五十二万（实际上是三百万人）。在马歇尔计划拨款中占首位并号称“充分就业”的英国，今年一月失业是三十七万人，比马歇尔计划开始时多七万多人，即增加了将近四分之一。比利时今年一月失业是三十九万人，一年前是三十万人。荷兰从前年十月到去年十月，一年内失业人数增加了一万六千人，从去年十月到今年二月，又增加了五万多人。芬兰从去年一月到今年一月，失业增加了一倍。挪威同时期失业增加五分之一。只有四百多万人口的小小丹麦，失业今年一月达到了七万人，较一年前约增加了六分之一。瑞典失业人数从前年十一月到去年十一月，增加了四分之一以上。在美国直接管制与所谓“无偿援助”下的西德，失业在今年二月达到了二百多万人，较一年以前增加了一百多万。
    由此可见马歇尔计划“恩惠”的结果之一，就是受“援”国家失业的普遍增加。原因很简单，因为按照马歇尔计划下的双边协定，这些国家必须从美国输入原来本国能够出产的粮食和货物，因此不能不破坏这些国家的生产，并带来失业。
