Employee Salary Income Tax
	Should Be Paid at the Workplace
To the Editor:
	In the winter of 1948, employees paid salary income tax for two months, but not since. However, in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, the local authorities still require the families of factory employees in their hometowns to pay taxes (such as paying rice and corvee labor). I believe the burden on employees should be borne by the employees themselves at the factories and mines, and their families in their hometowns should no longer be required to pay taxes. I don't know if this is correct. Please advise.

Comrade Wang Yu:
	We have forwarded your opinion to the State Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for reply as follows:
	Your suggestion that the taxes payable by factory employees should be paid by the employees at their respective factories and mines is correct. Regarding the issue of employees paying income tax, the situation in North China is as follows: In the winter of 1948, North China began collecting salary and wage income tax, but due to different collection methods in various regions, the former North China People's Government explicitly ordered a temporary suspension in May 1949. The "Essential Points for the Implementation of National Taxation Policies" passed by the 17th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on January 27, 1950, stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 5, the levy of salary and remuneration income tax, which will be levied immediately after the tax law is promulgated. This is a type of tax that factory and mine employees should pay. The corvee rice and corvee labor mentioned in your letter that the local authorities in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, require the families of factory employees in their hometowns to provide is unrelated to the income tax collected by the tax bureau.

### 职工薪给所得税  应在工作地点缴纳

　　职工薪给所得税
    应在工作地点缴纳编辑同志：
    一九四八年冬天，职工曾出过两个月的薪资所得税，以后就不出了。但平原省林县，地方还要在厂职工的原籍家庭缴税（如差米变工米等）。我认为职工的负担应由职工本人在厂矿缴纳，不应再要原籍家庭缴税。不知对否？请告知。            兵工十药厂  王玉王玉同志：
    你的意见，我们转请中央人民政府财政部税务总局答复如下：
    来信建议工厂职工应出的税，应由职工在所在厂矿缴纳，这是对的。关于职工缴所得税问题，在华北地区来说，是这样的：一九四八年冬华北曾开征薪给工资所得税，复因各地征收办法不同，前华北人民政府于一九四九年五月明令暂行停止。一九五○年一月二十七日政务院第十七次政务会议通过的“全国税政实施要则”第四项第五款规定开征薪给报酬所得税，税法公布后，即行开征。这是厂矿职工应纳的一种税。信内所提平原省林县地方，要在厂职工原籍出差米、变工米等，这与税局征收的所得税无关。
