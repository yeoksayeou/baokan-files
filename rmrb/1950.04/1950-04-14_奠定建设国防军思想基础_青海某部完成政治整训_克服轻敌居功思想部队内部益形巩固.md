Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th: A certain unit of the Qinghai Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, during a four-month political rectification from November of last year to mid-March of this year, has overcome some erroneous non-proletarian thoughts existing in the unit and has laid a solid ideological foundation for building a strong national defense force.

After Ma Bufang's bandit troops were mostly annihilated and the unit entered Qinghai, some cadres developed complacent and careless thoughts, relaxing their vigilance against the enemy. Some soldiers also mistakenly believed that "the revolution has succeeded, there are no more battles to fight, and guns are no longer needed," leading to incorrect thoughts of "leaving the team and retiring." After studying, the awareness of the commanders and fighters has been raised a step further, and they unanimously believe that the most important thing after the revolution has been victorious is to consolidate the victory, thereby clearly establishing the idea that the People's Liberation Army will always be a fighting force. At the beginning of the rectification, some personnel were uneasy about working in the Qinghai area, saying that Qinghai was remote and backward. After studying, most commanders and fighters clearly recognized that building a new Qinghai is part of building a new China, and they are determined to work hard for the construction of a new Qinghai. After the rectification, all commanders and fighters immediately devoted themselves to the large-scale production movement with high enthusiasm and initiative. Many units have proposed to make contributions in production and construction. One company even had 52 soldiers who wanted to strive for merit in production and join the Communist Party. Other important gains in the political rectification were overcoming the individualistic ideas of complacency, seeking enjoyment, and clamoring for fame and status among many people; correcting the phenomena of some people flaunting seniority, not learning modestly, and being satisfied with the status quo; many new soldiers who joined the army also clearly distinguished class boundaries, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and boldly confessed their past hidden histories after the grievance sessions in the rectification, making the internal organization of the unit more pure, more united, and more consolidated.

The main experiences of the unit's four-month political rectification are two: First, the centralized leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, with the leaders personally conducting in-depth and repeated ideological mobilization and correcting erroneous learning attitudes in a timely manner. For example, the head of a certain battalion promptly corrected several incorrect learning attitudes in the cadre study of the battalion, such as "not speaking in peer criticism, saying 'there are prejudices'; suppressing lower-level criticism; saying bad things about higher-level criticism," and "blushing when criticized, not being proactive but negative," so that the study could be carried out well and smoothly. Second, the study of documents must be carried out in light of the ideological situation of the troops, with purpose, step-by-step, and with emphasis. For example, a certain unit divided the documents into three parts for study: studying "To Whom Does Honor Belong?" and "Where Does Victory Come From?" was mainly to overcome complacency and self-satisfaction; studying "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists" including "Examples of Several Bad Ideological Tendencies" and "The Communist's View of Enjoyment" was mainly to overcome various types of individualistic thinking; studying "Resolutions of the Second Plenary Session" and "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" was mainly to strengthen the idea of always being a fighting force and a working force, and to establish the idea of long-term construction of a new Qinghai.

　　奠定建设国防军思想基础
    青海某部完成政治整训
    克服轻敌居功思想部队内部益形巩固
    【新华社兰州十二日电】人民解放军青海军区某部在自去年十一月至今年三月中旬四个月的政治整训中，克服了部队中存在着的一些错误的非无产阶级的思想，已为建设强大的国防军奠定了牢固的思想基础。
    当马步芳匪军主方被歼，该部进驻青海后，某些干部曾产生了轻敌麻痹的思想，放松了对敌斗争的警惕性；部分战士亦错误地认为“革命成功了，没有什么仗可打了，枪杆子吃不开了”，产生了不正确的“离队退伍”思想。经过学习后，指战员们的认识都已提高了一步，一致认为革命得到了胜利以后，最重要的还是巩固胜利，因而明确确立了人民解放军永远是战斗队的思想。整训开始时，曾有部分人员不安心在青海地区工作，说青海偏僻、落后。学习后一般指战员都明确地认识了建设新青海乃是建设新中国的一部分，决心为建设新青海而努力。整训结束后，全体指战员即以高度的热情和积极性纷纷投入大生产运动。许多单位都提出要在生产建设中立功，某连并有五十二名战士要在生产中争取立功参加共产党。政治整训中其他重要的收获是克服了不少人的居功享乐、闹名誉地位的个人主义思想；纠正了部分人员摆老资格、不虚心学习和满足于现状等现象；许多新参加部队的新战士，在经过整训中的诉苦运动后，也比较明确地划清了阶级界线，分清了敌我，并大胆地坦白了过去隐瞒的历史，使部队内部组织更纯洁、更团结和更巩固。
    该部四个月政治整训的主要经验有二：首先是各级共产党党委的集中领导，首长亲自进行深入反复的思想动员，及时纠正错误的学习态度。如某营首长在该营干部学习中及时纠正了“同级批评不说话，说‘有成见’；下级批评就镇压；上级批评讲歹话”、“受了批评脸红耳赤，不是积极而是消极”几种不正确的学习态度，因而使学习能够很好地顺利展开。其次是学习文件必须针对部队思想情况，有目的、有步骤、有重点地进行。如某部把文件编成三部分学习：学习“荣誉是属于谁的”、“胜利从何而来”时主要是为了克服居功自满的思想：学习“论共产党员修养”中“几个不良思想倾向的举例”和“共产党员享受观”时主要是为了克服各种类型的个人主义思想；学习“二中全会决议”、“目前形势与我们的任务”时主要是坚定永远是战斗队又是工作队和树立长期建设新青海的思想。
