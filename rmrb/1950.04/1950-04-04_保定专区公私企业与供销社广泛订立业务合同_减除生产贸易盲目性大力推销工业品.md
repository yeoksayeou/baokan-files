Baoding Special District Public-Private Enterprises and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Widely Sign Business Contracts
Reduce Blindness in Production and Trade, Vigorously Promote Industrial Products

[Our Newspaper News] Public and private enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in Baoding City have been signing business contracts one after another to organize industrial products to go to the countryside and communicate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

According to statistics from the Baoding Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, from October of last year to February of this year, the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties in the special district have signed a total of more than 50 kinds of contracts with various specialized companies, the special district supply and marketing cooperative with state-owned companies, county supply and marketing cooperatives, and brotherly supply and marketing cooperatives. Experience has proven that signing business contracts is an important link in supporting production and urban-rural trade, because after signing the contract, both parties have a certain basis in production or trade, reducing blindness in production or urban-rural trade. In order to support sideline production in disaster areas and solve the difficulty in selling native cloth, it is more planned to exchange for coal and grain to supply the needs of farmers. The Baoding Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is now signing native cloth contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives of its affiliated counties. From the end of February to March 9 this year, it has successively signed formal contracts with Rongcheng, Qingyuan, Xushui, Anxin, Wanxian, Tangxian and other supply and marketing cooperatives, and other counties are signing contracts one after another. The contract emphasizes that the quality must be improved, and the cloth must be sorted according to the requirements of the supply and marketing cooperative. It is stipulated that Qingyuan, Gaoyang, Anxin, Rongcheng, Xincheng and other counties shall complete 175,000 bolts in May, with one square foot of cloth equivalent to 1.2 jin of red grain. The cloth from Wangdu, Wanxian, and Tangxian is exchanged for yarn, with each ten counts of yarn exchanged for four bolts of native cloth, and 4 million square feet of native cloth to be completed in May.

In addition, the special district cooperative also signed contracts for fire nitrate and skin nitrate with its affiliated county supply and marketing cooperatives. At the same time, it introduced the Beijing Egg Products Company to sign egg products contracts with its affiliated county supply and marketing cooperatives; as of March 9, it had formally established relationships with Mancheng, Qingyuan, Wangdu, Xushui, Zhuoxian, Tangxian and other supply and marketing cooperatives to collect eggs. Tangxian alone collected 30,000 eggs in one day, and Baoding Dongguan collected 300,000 eggs in just twelve days. This plays a great role in supporting the sideline production of the masses and ensuring exports. The price of eggs is agreed upon by both parties, and the packaging and round-trip transportation costs are borne by the Egg Products Company, which does not process the eggs and transports them to Tianjin; the supply and marketing cooperative is responsible for escorting the goods, with a subsidy of 6 jin of millet per person per day, and submitting a list for accounting every five days and making a purchase plan every ten days, and settling accounts once before the 22nd of each month. The price is agreed upon by both parties, and the purchase of eggs from cooperative members is 2% higher than the listed price, and the purchase from non-members is based on the listed price. The supply and marketing cooperative is responsible for the quality of the eggs and the storage of the warehouse. If the inspection reveals that the breakage is within 3%, the company is responsible, and if it exceeds this, the supply and marketing cooperative is responsible. The company also gives each supply and marketing cooperative a handling fee of 3%.

In order to organize coal and iron to go to the countryside and provide a large amount of fuel to the rural areas, the Coal and Iron Company sent ten cadres to contact the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties, and has now established sales outlets along the Jinghan Railway, Fangshunqiao, Wangdu, Yuzhuang, Xushui and other stations. In order to support industrial production, the Grease Company signed a contract with seven private oil mills, including Baoji, Xiyuan and the public-owned Xiefeng, in February to supply 1.17 million jin of peanuts; the oil mills shall hand over 40.5 jin of pure oil to the company for every 100 jin of peanuts, and the oil cake shall belong to the oil mills. This solves the difficulty of insufficient raw materials for the oil mills in the spring. The company also sent eight cadres to Qingyuan, Mancheng and other places to contact, and is preparing to establish coal and oil sales outlets in Lixian to solve the coal and oil supply problems in Renqiu, Raoyang, Boye and other counties, while also purchasing peanuts. The Department Store Company has also signed contracts for distribution relationships with private towel factories, battery industries, and the weaving factory of the Production and Education Institute. The Salt Company instructed three cadres to specifically contact various counties, and has now reached agreements with Xushui, Wangdu, Wanxian, Anguo, Dingxian and other supply and marketing cooperatives to sign business contracts, which are awaiting signature. The manager of the company said: In the future, it is necessary to supply the rural areas with the salt they need in large quantities and at low prices. At the same time, it is also necessary to change the business style, regardless of whether it is office hours or not, as long as farmers and citizens come to buy salt, they should be sold to them, even at night, and resolutely overcome the past bureaucratic management methods. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is negotiating with weaving households in Baoding City to prepare to sign contracts.

　　保定专区公私企业与供销社广泛订立业务合同
    减除生产贸易盲目性大力推销工业品
    【本报讯】保定市各公私营企业、供销社纷纷签定业务合同，组织工业品下乡，沟通城乡物资交流。
    据保定专区供销社统计，从去年十月开始截至今年二月止，专区各县供销社与各专业公司、专区供销社与国营公司、县供销社，以及兄弟供销社之间相互签定合同共达五十几种。经验证明，签定业务合同是扶植生产，城乡贸易的重要环节，因为签定合同以后，甲乙双方在生产上或贸易上都有了一定的依据，减少了生产或城乡贸易上的盲目性。为扶植灾区副业生产，解决土布的销路困难，更有计划地换回煤、粮，供给农民需要。现保定专区供销社正与所辖各县供销社签定土布合同，从本年二月下旬开始至三月九日止，已先后与容城、清苑、徐水、安新、完县、唐县等供销社正式订立合同，其他县份正陆续签定中。在合同中强调指出：必须做到提高质量，并根据供销社要求进行整庄。规定清苑、高阳、安新、容城、新城等县在五月份完成一十七万五千匹，一方尺布顶一斤二两红粮。望都、完县、唐县的布是以纱换布，每块十支纱换土布四匹，五月份完成土布四百万方尺。
    另外该专区社亦与所辖各县供销社签定火硝、皮硝合同。同时介绍了北京蛋品公司与其所辖各县供销社签定蛋品合同；截至三月九日止已与满城、清苑、望都、徐水、涿县、唐县等供销社正式建立关系进行收蛋，仅唐县一天就收三万个鸡蛋，保定东关仅十二天就收购鸡蛋三十万个。这对扶植群众副业生产、保证出口均起很大作用。鸡蛋价格双方协议，包装费及往返运费由蛋品公司负责，不加工运天津；供销社负责押送，每人每天补助小米六斤，每五天列表报账一次，十天做一回收购计划，每月二十二号以前结账一次。价格双方协议，收购社员鸡蛋时高于牌价百分之二，非社员按牌价收购。供销社负责蛋品质量和仓库的保管，将货运到公司收验时，如检查出破、坏在百分之三以内公司负责，超过者由供销社负责。公司并给与各供销社百分之三的手续费。
    煤铁公司为组织煤铁下乡，大量供给农村燃料，曾派十名干部赴各县供销社联系，现已与京汉路沿线，方顺桥、望都、于庄、徐水等车站建立代售栈。油脂公司为扶植工业生产，于二月间和私营保记、协远及公营协丰等七户油厂签定供应一百一十七万斤花生米的合同；油厂则按每百斤花生米交公司纯油四○·五斤，油饼归油厂所有。这样就解决了油厂春季原料不足的困难。该公司又曾派了八名干部赴清苑、满城等地联系，并筹备在蠡县建立煤、油代售栈，借此解决任邱、饶阳、博野等县煤、油供应问题，同时收购花生。百货公司与私营毛巾工厂、电池业、生产教养院织布工厂亦已签定了经销关系的合同。盐业公司责成三个干部专门与各县联络，现已与徐水、望都、完县、安国、定县等供销社商妥订立业务合同，正待签字，该公司经理表示：今后要大量廉价供应农村需要的食盐。同时还要改变营业作风，不管办公与否，农民、市民只要来买盐，都应卖给他们，即便是夜里也要出售，坚决克服过去机关化的经营方法。花纱布公司正与保市各织布户进行协商准备签定合同。
