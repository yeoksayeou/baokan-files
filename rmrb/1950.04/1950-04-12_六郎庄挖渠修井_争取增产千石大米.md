　　Liulangzhuang Digs Canals and Repairs Wells
    Striving for an Increase of 1,000 Piculs of Rice
    [Our Dispatch] All the farmers in Liulangzhuang, west of Beijing, are fighting to increase rice production by 1,000 piculs. This plan was initially proposed by the village's Communist Party branch, initiated by Party member cadres who mobilized all village cadres to discuss it, and approved by the farmers' representative meeting. The specific methods for increasing production are to increase fertilizer, repair canals and artesian wells, eliminate pests, and cultivate intensively. The village is a well-known rice-producing area west of Beijing. The entire village has 3,456 mu of paddy fields. The annual output is 2.4 shi per mu, and this year it is planned to increase the yield by 0.3 shi per mu, for a total increase of 1,036.8 shi. Before liberation, 80% of the land was controlled by landlords and rich peasants. During the land reform, the peasants were allocated 1,700 mu of paddy fields. In the first year after the liberation, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was extremely high. The usual habit was to go to the fields after the Qingming Festival, but this year people went to the fields to smooth the rice paddies much earlier. Six days before the Qingming Festival (March 27th), the Party and Youth League branches first held a meeting to discuss and formulate a plan to expand production. The next evening, the heads of the village government, Party, cooperative, Youth League and other departments, according to the specific conditions of the village, drafted a plan to increase rice production by 1,000 piculs: (1) Repair the drainage canals in the east and north of the village. (2) The whole village will take action to eliminate pests and prevent disasters. Experienced farmers suggested that after the Grain Rain period, the fields should be flooded after plowing to float the insect eggs to the surface and scoop them out to eliminate them. (3) To prevent drought in the paddy fields, repair the 18 broken and abandoned artesian wells. The village has relatively sufficient fertilizer, so this was not mentioned. The above plan was discussed at the general meeting of farmers' representatives on the evening of the 29th of last month, and was unanimously approved. The canal digging project started on April 1st and was completed on April 2nd. Pest control, well repair and other work are being prepared.

　　六郎庄挖渠修井
    争取增产千石大米
    【本报讯】京西六郎庄全体农民正为增产千石大米而斗争。这一计划最初是由该村中共支部提出，由党员干部发动全村干部研讨，并经农民代表会通过的。增产的具体办法是增加肥料、修整水渠、自流井、除虫和精耕细作。该村是京西有名的大米产区。全村共有稻田三、四五六亩。常年产量每亩二石四斗，今年计划每亩增产三斗，共计增产一、○三六·八石。解放前百分之八十的土地都掌握在地主、富农手中。土地改革中，农民共分得了一、七○○亩水地。翻身第一年，农民生产情绪火热高涨。常年习惯是清明才下地，今年却老早就有人下地抹稻埂了。清明前六日（三月二十七日），党、团支部首先集会讨论制订扩大生产计划。次日晚，村政府、党、合作社、团等部门负责人，根据本村具体情况拟订增产千石大米计划草案：（一）修整村东、村北两排水渠。（二）全村动手，除虫防灾。有经验的农民提出：谷雨过后，刨完地就放水，使虫卵浮上水面，捞出消灭。（三）防止稻田干旱，修起已坏废的十八眼自流井。该村肥料因准备比较充足，故未提出。上述计划于上月二十九日晚在全体农民代表大会上讨论时，获得一致的赞同。挖渠工程于四月一日开工，四月二日即告竣工。除虫、修井等工作正筹备中。
