    Creates Flame Tube Descaling and Cutting Machine
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric] Wei Jiazheng, a technician at the Zha Kou Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Hangzhou Office, created a "Flame Tube Descaling and Cutting Dual-Purpose Machine." Its working efficiency is 100 times higher than manual rust removal and 30 times higher than manual pipe cutting. This machine was created by Wei Jiazheng after visiting the "Flame Tube Descaling Machine" created by Yu Changqing of the Jinhua Depot last September and making improvements. When the machine is working, only one person is needed, and it only takes two and a half minutes to remove water rust from a flame tube, and only twelve to fifteen seconds to cut a pipe. It is reported that similar machines in other bureaus do not have such high work efficiency. The Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has sent personnel to draw the machine's design and plans to promote it to all railway depots across the country for reference.

    创制焰管除锈割管机
    【新华社上海电】上海铁路局杭州办事处闸口机务段技术员魏家正创制了“焰管除锈割管两用机”，工作效率比人工敲锈提高一百倍，比人工割管提高三十倍。该机系魏家正参观了金华机务段余长清去年九月创制的“焰管除锈机”后加以改进制成的。该机在工作时只需一个人，除一根焰管水锈仅需两分半钟，割管一根仅需十二秒至十五秒。据悉目前其他局段的类似机械还没有这样高的工作效率。中央人民政府铁道部机务局已派员绘制该机图样，拟推广介绍全国各铁路机务段参考采用。
