Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government convened a symposium today on the nutritional value of the new standard rice and flour. Attendees included Yang Enfu, a grain expert from the Nutrition Research Office of the Central Hygiene Experimental Institute; Zhang Jinghua, a grain expert from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Zhou Xuan, Director of the Dietetics Department of Peking Union Medical College; Qu Huiqing, Director of the Dietetics Department of Peking University Hospital; Liu Shihao, a physician from Tongren Hospital; and over 30 representatives, including professors from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, and Agricultural University who study nutrition, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Food Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Grain Corporation. The meeting discussed the impact of grain processing on nutritional components and deficiency diseases from both a scientific and experimental perspective. The nutrition experts attending the meeting unanimously and enthusiastically supported the State Council's decision to change grain processing standards.

The meeting began with a report by Chen Wenzhi, a representative from the Grain Corporation, on the past situation of rice and flour processing. He pointed out that in the past, the general urban population had developed the bad habit of preferring refined rice and refined flour. For example, in North China, the finished flour product was between 76 and 74 (referring to the flour produced per 100 jin of wheat). In Beijing, the sales of the lower-quality Sanlu Flour (79-77) were extremely poor.

Yang Enfu of the Central Hygiene Experimental Institute said in his report, "An Overview of International Grain Processing," that in recent years, the extraction rate of wheat flour commonly used in food-importing countries is around 90 percent, 96 percent in Poland, and 95 percent in the Soviet Union. The 81 flour currently stipulated by the government is still very low compared to the standards of other countries.

The experts explained the advantages of 81 flour and 92 rice in terms of their nutritional components: every 100 grams of whole wheat flour (ground with bran) contains 0.4 mg of Vitamin B1, 0.17 mg of Vitamin B2, and 5 mg of nicotinic acid; every 100 grams of coarse flour (85%) contains 0.3 mg of Vitamin B1, 0.1 mg of Vitamin B2, and 1.5 mg of nicotinic acid; while refined flour (70%) only contains 0.06 mg of Vitamin B1, 0.05 mg of Vitamin B2, and 1 mg of nicotinic acid. The nutritional components of coarse rice are also more abundant than those of refined rice.

Yang Enfu said in his report that beriberi patients are numerous in Chinese cities because they eat refined rice, while there are few patients in the countryside because they eat brown rice. Zhou Xuan of Peking Union Medical College and Liu Shihao of Tongren Hospital further elaborated on the benefits of eating coarse grains. They believe that most of the nutrients in grains are contained in the bran and germ, so coarse grains are rich in vitamins. A deficiency of Vitamin B1 can lead to severe beriberi, and mild cases can cause indigestion and mental fatigue; a deficiency of Vitamin B2 can easily cause conjunctival congestion, inflammation of the tip of the tongue, and skin inflammation; a deficiency of nicotinic acid can easily cause skin inflammation and neurological disorders. Zhou Xuan especially emphasized that because the living standards of the Chinese people are low, more than 50 percent of their bodily heat is derived from grains, so eating coarse grains is good. She said, "I am very excited about the State Council's decision. In the past, we often promoted the value of coarse grains from a nutritional standpoint, but with little effect. Today, the government's decision has finally fulfilled our long-cherished wish."

Yuan Hanqing, Director of the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, concluded by expressing his hope that the nutrition experts attending today's symposium would do more to promote standard rice and flour to the people, and that they would help the government test the composition of rice and flour.

　　营养专家集会座谈标准米面
    一致认为粗米粗面营养成分比精米精面为多
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府文化部科学普及局今日召开新标准米面营养价值座谈会。出席中央卫生实验院营养研究室谷类专家杨恩孚、农业科学研究院谷类专家张景华、协和医学院饮食部主任周璇、北大医院饮食部主任区惠清、同仁医院医师刘士豪及北大、清华、师范大学、农业大学等研究营养的教授和食品工业部、农业部、粮食公司等代表三十余人。会议从学理及试验结果上讨论了粮食加工对于营养成分的影响及缺乏病等问题。与会的营养专家们一致热烈拥护政务院关于改变粮食加工标准的决定。
    会议首由粮食公司代表陈文治报告已往米面加工情形。他指出：过去一般城市人民都养成了喜食精米和精面的不良习惯，例如华北面粉成品在七六到七四之间（按指每百斤麦子磨出的面粉），以北京来说，较次的三鹿粉（七九——七七）的销路即极坏。
    中央卫生实验院杨恩孚在《国际粮食加工概况》的报告中说：食粮进口各国近年通用之麦粉提取率为百分之九十左右，波兰为九十六，苏联为九十五。现在政府规定的八一面和世界各国的标准相比，还是很低的。
    专家们从所含营养成分方面来说明八一面和九二米的优点：每百公分全粉（连麸皮一起磨）含第一号乙种维生素○·四公丝，第二号乙种维生素○·一七公丝，烟草酸五公丝；每百公分粗面（八五成）含第一号乙种维生素○·三公丝，第二号乙种维生素○·一公丝，烟草酸一·五公丝；而精面（七十成）则只含第一号乙种维生素○·○六公丝，第二号乙种维生素○·○五公丝，烟草酸一公丝。粗米的营养成分也较精米为多。
    杨恩孚在报告中说：中国城市中因食精米，故脚气病患者很多；乡村中因为食糙米，患者便很少。协和医学院周璇和同仁医院刘士豪更进一步说到吃粗粮的好处。他们认为谷类的营养成分大半含在谷皮及谷芽中，所以粗粮维生素多。缺乏第一号乙种维生素时，重的要患脚气病，轻的会害消化不良、精神疲倦等症；缺乏第二号乙种维生素时，易患眼结膜充血，舌尖发炎及皮肤发炎；缺乏烟草酸则易患皮肤发炎及神经失常症。周璇特别强调我国人民因生活水准低，身体上百分之五十以上的热力都是从谷类得来的，所以食粗粮是好的。她说：“政务院的决定使我感到非常兴奋，以前我们常常站在营养学立场上宣传粗粮的价值，但效果很少，今天政府的决定，终于使我们多年来的愿望达到了。”
    文化部科学普及局局长袁翰青最后发言，他希望今天出席座谈的营养专家们多向人民作标准米面的宣传，并希望他们多多帮助政府化验米面的成分。
