Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 16th: Spring plowing preparations in various parts of Guangdong Province have been completed one after another, and some areas have entered spring plowing production.

Due to the later liberation, the working foundation in the vast new areas is weak; local bullies and some landlords are either deliberately sabotaging or, because they do not understand the policies of the People's Government, wasting grain, slaughtering cattle, and even abandoning land and fleeing; in addition, the spring plowing season starts earlier, so Guangdong Province's spring plowing preparations are urgent and complex. Based on this situation, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government instructed all special districts and county people's governments as early as December last year to vigorously mobilize the masses and start preparing for various aspects related to spring plowing. In early February this year, the Provincial Government promulgated the "Measures for Handling Sandy Fields," specifying that everything is for production, and guaranteeing the legitimate profits and rights of landlords and rich peasants for their investment. These measures encourage the tenancy method of farmers providing labor, owners providing food, and capital investment, and order landlords and rich peasants to start cultivating within a time limit and not to abandon land; the measures point out: for any abandoned land, the local people's government should recruit people to cultivate it. At the same time, in order to solve the problems of spring plowing rations, seeds, and fertilizers for farmers, the Provincial People's Government issued a large amount of agricultural loan grain, and the Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank issued agricultural loans of 7.5 billion yuan. Various counties also organized credit agricultural loans. In addition, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government issued an emergency instruction in early March, stipulating that in March and April, all localities should focus on mobilizing the masses to carry out rent reduction and rent refund, so that farmers can use the fruits obtained from rent reduction and rent refund to solve the difficulties of spring plowing rations and seeds.

With the active help of the People's Government, the vast number of farmers in Guangdong Province are carrying out dike and embankment repair work with great enthusiasm. The East, West, North, and Han Rivers have now started dredging work, and after completion, 10 million mu of rice fields can be spared from water and drought disasters. Seventy to eighty percent of abandoned sandy fields have now been adjusted and cultivation has begun. In addition, in counties such as Zhongshan, Sanshui, Guangning, Nanxiong, Chenghai, and Panyu, farmers mostly organize labor mutual aid to jointly solve various difficulties in spring plowing.

　　广东完成春耕准备
    部分地区进入春耕
    【本报讯】据新华社广州十六日电：广东省各地春耕准备工作已陆续完成，部分地区并已进入春耕生产。
    由于解放较晚，广大新区工作基础薄弱；恶霸及部分地主或者蓄意破坏，或者因为不明白人民政府的政策，浪费粮食，宰杀耕牛，甚至抛地逃亡；加之春耕季节又较早开始，广东省的春耕准备工作是紧迫而复杂的。广东省人民政府根据这种情况，早在去年十二月即指示各专署、县人民政府大力发动群众，着手进行各项有关春耕的准备工作。今年二月初，省府颁布了《沙田处理办法》，指明一切为了生产，对于地主和富农，保证其投资的合法利润与权益。该项办法，鼓励采取农民出工、业主出口粮和出资本的佃耕方式，并责令地主富农限期开耕，不得抛荒；该办法指出：凡被抛荒的田地，地方人民政府应招人承耕。同时，省人民政府为着解决农民的春耕口粮，种籽和肥料等问题，发放了大批的农贷粮，另由人民银行广东分行发放农业贷款七十五亿元，各县亦举办信用农贷。此外，广东省人民政府于三月初颁发紧急指示，规定三、四两个月各地应将发动群众进行减租退租列为中心工作，使农民能够以减租退租所得到的果实，解决春耕口粮、种籽等项困难。
    广东省的广大农民在人民政府的积极帮助下正以高度的热情进行修堤和修围工作。东、西、北、韩四江现已兴工疏浚，完工以后可使一千万亩稻田免于水旱天灾。抛荒沙田现已有百分之七十至八十已经调整并开始种植。此外，如中山、三水、广宁、南雄、澄海、番禺等县，农民多组织劳动互助，合力解决春耕中的各种困难。
