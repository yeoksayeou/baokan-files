　　U.S. New York Residents Delegation
    Protests U.S.-Made Chiang Planes' Rampage
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th: According to a report in the New York Worker's Daily on March 29th: A delegation of New York residents requested a meeting with U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Chairman Austin, on March 28th. The representatives will protest the continuous terror bombings of Chinese coastal cities by U.S.-made aircraft, which will be part of a protest action involving a picket line set up in front of the U.S. delegation headquarters on March 29th. This protest was called for by the Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee.
    The Worker's Daily also published an editorial on the same day titled "Chinese Children as Victims," urging readers to join the protest. The editorial stated: What does "old friend of China" mean? A person who helps drop bombs on Chinese women and children. Secretary of State Acheson says he is a friend of China. But he and the White House are sending planes and bombs to the Chiang Kai-shek war criminals in Taiwan. Washington is slaughtering Chinese civilians as much as possible. Washington is indeed guilty of massacring Chinese mothers, fathers, and children. Does anyone doubt this? Every Chinese person knows this.

　　美国纽约居民代表团
    抗议美制蒋机肆虐
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格分社六日电：据三月二十九日纽约工人日报报道：纽约居民代表团于三月二十八日要求与美国驻联合国代表团主席奥斯丁会晤。代表将抗议美制飞机对中国沿海城市实施连续的恐怖轰炸，这抗议将是三月二十九日在美国代表团总部门前设置纠察线的抗议行动的一部分。这一抗议是由民主远东政策委员会所号召的。
    工人日报同日并刊载一篇标题为《被害的中国儿童》的社论，敦促读者加入这次抗议。社论称：什么叫“中国的老朋友”？一个协助把炸弹投在中国妇女和儿童身上的人。国务卿艾奇逊说他是中国的朋友。可是他和白宫正将飞机和炸弹送给台湾的蒋介石战犯。华盛顿正在尽可能地屠杀中国平民。华盛顿实在是滥杀中国的母亲们、父亲们以及孩子们的罪人，还有任何人怀疑吗？每一个中国人都知道这一点。
