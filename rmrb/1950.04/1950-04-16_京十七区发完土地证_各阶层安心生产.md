　　Seventeenth District of Beijing Issues Land Certificates
    All Classes Securely Engaged in Production
    [Our Newspaper] The Seventeenth District of Beijing's suburbs has completed the issuance of state-owned land use certificates, and farmers, as well as former landlords and rich peasants, are now securely engaged in production. The land reform in this district began in October of last year and was carried out in four phases, concluding in March of this year. During the land reform, a total of 49,093 mu of land was confiscated and requisitioned from landlords, etc., and distributed to 8,509 households of landless and land-poor peasants, for the use of 39,422 people. Regarding land use relations before and after the land reform, calculated by the average per person, landlords decreased from 7.7 mu to 2.12 mu, rich peasants decreased from 6.6 mu to 4.2 mu, middle peasants increased from 2.11 mu to 2.72 mu, poor peasants increased from 0.88 mu to 1.65 mu, and farm laborers increased from 0.23 mu to 2.4 mu. The district government, upon the conclusion of each phase of the land reform, promptly seized the time to fill out and issue state-owned land use certificates. As of April 4th, all land certificates in the district have been issued. (Yuan Yueyun)
