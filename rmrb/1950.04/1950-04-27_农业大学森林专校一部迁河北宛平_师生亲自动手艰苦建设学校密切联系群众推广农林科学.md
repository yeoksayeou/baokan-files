　　Agricultural University Forest Specialty School
    Part One Moves to Wanping, Hebei
    Teachers and Students Personally Undertake Arduous School Construction, Closely Contact the Masses to Promote Agricultural and Forestry Science

    [Our Newspaper News] Part of the Forest Specialty School affiliated with Beijing Agricultural University has been moved from Shanxi to Jinshan, Wanping County, Hebei, to establish a new school. The Forest Specialty School was founded in June 1948. Lingkong Mountain (in Qinyuan County, Taiyue Mountain area), which is rich in teaching specimens and experimental sites, was chosen as the school site. At the beginning of its establishment, only two teachers and five students were transferred from the former North China University Agricultural College. With the assistance of local forest area people, they built the school while enrolling students (the newly enrolled students also participated in the school construction). Teachers and students personally took action, using an ancient temple on Lingkong Mountain, turning the altar tables and incense tables into lecterns and desks, removing the idols, and rebuilding the classrooms. In two months, they completed the renovation of 110 rooms and four large courtyards. Only one-fifth of the entire project was hired labor. Overcoming the difficulty of insufficient funds, the school officially opened on August 8 of that year. It has gradually developed over the past two years, and now has three classes of students, most of whom are revolutionary cadres and students from former anti-Japanese middle schools. Their learning is combined with practice, adopting the method of half-day classes and half-day internships. For example, during surveying class, they would go to the mountains to survey in the afternoon; during the digging medicinal herbs campaign, they first studied medicinal plant courses; in order to study botany, the students assisted the Huoshan Plant Survey Institute in sorting out plant specimens; for internships, in addition to using the natural environment of the mountain, there are also nurseries, farms, and dry distillation plants.

    Students first study at the school for a period of time to lay a certain scientific and cultural foundation, and then go to work in practice to exercise. For example, last spring, the school's students cooperated with the local forest area to launch a tree planting and afforestation movement in Qin'an and other counties, organizing more than 20 villages of people to plant more than 15,000 trees; at the same time, they mobilized the people to prevent forest fires and organized the people in nearby villages to extinguish mountain fires covering more than 1,000 mu, and widely launched forest protection propaganda. The school's first class of students jointly organized agricultural and forestry production and sales cooperatives with the people in Beiping Town, Anze County, which have now expanded to Hongdong, Huo County, Qinyuan and other counties. According to statistics, the school has cooperated with the masses in various places to run two lumbering operations, two wood factories (with transportation yards attached), one each of medicinal material shops, tea factories, forest exchanges, and beet cooperative farms (with sugar making equipment). Recently, the school has again transferred students from the second class to Huo County, Shanxi, to jointly prepare with the county government to establish an agricultural and forestry farm (including running nurseries, forest logging and management, and promoting the planting of "S" brand cotton). The establishment of these undertakings not only enables students to concretely use the knowledge gained from books, but also promotes agricultural and forestry scientific knowledge and technology. Students humbly learn from the masses in their work, absorbing useful experience. For example, they learned from an old monk, broke his conservative ideas, and obtained his cooperation, making the work of using Forsythia and Scutellaria and other plants from the mountains to make tea a success.

    When part of the school moved to Jinshan this time, it still adhered to the spirit of building the school on Lingkong Mountain. The principal, teachers, and students all took action. From March 17 to the 16th of this month, they completed the repair of more than 70 dilapidated houses and the construction of stoves and repair of water pipes, employing only one carpenter and one mason each to provide guidance. The Jinshan Forest Specialty School officially opened on the 17th. There are more than 40 students. In addition to the natural environment of the mountain, which can be used for students' internships, there is also a forest farm of more than 1,000 mu (including 30 to 40 kinds of different tree species, about 80,000 trees) and a nursery of more than 5 mu. The students have cleared the nursery land and are preparing for spring sowing experiments. In addition, they are also carrying out vegetable production and planting work in their spare time.

　　农业大学森林专校
    一部迁河北宛平
    师生亲自动手艰苦建设学校密切联系群众推广农林科学
    【本报讯】北京农业大学所属的森林专科学校的一部分，已由山西迁河北宛平县金山建立新校。森林专科学校创建于一九四八年六月。选择了富有教学标本与实验场所的灵孔山（在山西沁源县。太岳山区）为校址。创建之初，仅由前华北大学农学院调去了两名教员和五名学生。他们在当地林区群众的协助之下，一面建校，一面招生（招来的新生也参加建校）。师生们亲自动手，利用灵孔山一座古庙，把神桌、香案变成讲桌、书案，除去神像，改建教室。两个月中完成了一百一十间房舍和四个大院落的修整工作。全部工程仅雇工五分之一。克服了经费不足的困难，于当年八月八日正式开学。两年来逐渐发展，现已有学生三班，其中大部是革命干部和前抗日中学的学生。他们的学习是与实际结合的，采取半天上课、半天实习的办法。如上测量课期间，下午便到山中测量；在挖药运动中，首先学习药用植物课；为了学习植物学，同学们便协助霍山植物调查所整理植物标本；为了实习，除利用本山自然环境外，另设有苗圃、农场和干馏厂。
    同学们首先在学校学习一个时期，打下了一定科学文化基础之后，即到实际工作中去锻炼。如去年春，该校同学与当地林区合作，在沁安等县展开了植树造林运动，组织起二十余村群众，共植树一万五千余株；同时发动群众防火护林，组织附近村庄群众扑灭山火达一千余亩，并广泛展开护林宣传。该校第一班同学曾在安泽县北平镇和群众共同组织农林生产推销合作社，现已发展到洪洞、霍县和沁源等县。统计该校在各地与群众合作举办的事业，计有开伐山林二处，木厂两个（附设有运输栈），药栈、制茶厂、森林交易所、甜菜合作农场（附制糖设备）各一处。最近该校又从第二班调派同学前往山西霍县与县政府共同筹备建立农林场（包括举办苗圃、森林开伐和管理、推广斯字棉种植等）。在这些事业的创立中，不独使学生从书本上取得的知识能达到具体使用，而且推广了农林科学知识和技术。同学们在工作中虚心向群众学习，吸取有用的经验。如他们曾向一个老和尚学习，打破他的保守思想，取得他的合作，使利用山中的连翘黄岑等植物制茶的工作获得了成功。
    此次该校一部分迁金山时，仍本灵孔山建校的精神，校长、教员、同学一齐动手，自三月十七日至本月十六日，已完成七十余间破房修缮和建炉灶修水道等工作，仅雇用木工、泥工各一人担任指导。金山森林专科学校已于十七日正式开学。计有同学四十余名。该地除本山自然环境可供同学实习外，另有千余亩林场（其中有各种不同的树本三、四十种约八万余株）和苗圃五亩多。同学们已将苗圃地开出来，准备作春季播种试验。此外，他们还在进行课余蔬菜生产的种植工作。
