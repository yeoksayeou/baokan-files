Worker-Created Comedy "Not a Cicada"
Receives High Praise After Performances in Beijing

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The comedy "Not a Cicada," written by worker Wei Lianzhen, has been performed continuously for six shows in Beijing by the Shijiazhuang Municipal Cultural Troupe since the 18th, entertaining representatives from Beijing's literary and art circles, trade unions, government agencies, organizations, and all employees of the Ministry of Railways, as well as departments such as the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Youth League School, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Training Class. The play has been praised by audiences, with continuous applause at the end of each performance. Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama, and Vice Presidents Zhang Geng and Cao Yu, after seeing the play, believed that, apart from the script itself needing to be more concise, the playwright's talent and the structure of the story were commendable. Tian Han, Director of the Bureau of Opera Reform of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and Deputy Director Yang Shaoxuan, Zhou Weizhi of the Ministry of Culture, and Zhang Menggeng, Feng Zi, and Wang Songsheng of the Literature and Art Department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, all strongly advocated that the play be performed publicly in Beijing after slight modifications. In his speech at a symposium held by the Ministry of Culture on the 22nd, Deputy Director Yang Shaoxuan believed that the play is a typical script in the worker creation movement and a great success in the theatrical revolution.

　　The Shijiazhuang Municipal Cultural Troupe has now received invitations from Tsinghua University, the Ministry of Culture, the Central People's Printing Factory, the Youth League Committee of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the State Council, the Youth League Committee of the Supreme People's Court, and the Youth League Committee of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and will perform for them successively. In addition, the troupe plans to perform for factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations in a planned manner during Red May, so that the play can meet with the broad masses and solicit opinions for revision.
