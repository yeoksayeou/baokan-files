　　Destroying Steel Rails to Make Shovels
    Huaiyang Prefecture Lacks Overall Perspective
    The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Materials Collection Team received a report from Gao Qin-feng, a farmer in Gaobanzhuang, Xinzheng, stating that there were more than 30 steel rails near the Dongguan Bridge in Fugou County. The Xinzheng Collection Station sent personnel to negotiate transport on March 17. Upon arrival, they found only 17 steel rails by the bridge, with traces of more than a dozen others nearby. The Fugou County government initially denied knowledge, but after interviewing local residents, it was discovered that four carts had transported some of the original 35 rails a week earlier. Further investigation at the loading and unloading station revealed that 18 rails had been transported by the Zhoukou City Yimin Iron Factory (operated by Huaiyang Prefecture) on the 13th, supposedly to make shovels (for river repair), with an order from the Fugou County government. As a result, the county government produced an order from Huaiyang Prefecture. The collection team immediately telegraphed the Zhoukou Municipal Government, urging them not to destroy the steel rails. The municipal government secretary replied that, on the order of the Huaiyang Prefecture, all 18 rails had been destroyed and made into shovels, and that the prefecture was sending people to collect steel rails from various counties.
    Now, the country is vigorously restoring and constructing railways. These materials cannot yet be produced in large quantities domestically and must be purchased from abroad. Transporting a single steel rail from the Soviet Union to Zhengzhou costs over 4 million RMB in freight alone (current prices). Therefore, a single steel rail is not easily obtained. The Ministry of Railways and the government have issued several instructions to collect old steel rails. The Huaiyang Prefecture appears to have knowingly violated these instructions. This act of departmentalism, disregarding the overall interests of the country, should be thoroughly reviewed, and the higher authorities should take appropriate action.

    Editor's Note: This letter was originally published in the Yangtze River Daily on April 7. The editor of that newspaper pointed out that the existence of this situation is due to the serious departmentalism of the Huaiyang Prefecture, Fugou County government, and Zhoukou Municipal government. Although their motive was "making shovels to repair the river," and they were starting from the interests of the masses, they did not consider the overall interests of the people, and objectively they committed the error of destroying state resources. We agree with this opinion.

### 毁掉钢轨制铁锹  淮阳专署缺乏全局观念

　　毁掉钢轨制铁锹
    淮阳专署缺乏全局观念
    郑州铁路局器材搜集组得到新郑高班庄农民高钦峰的报告，在扶沟县东关桥边有钢轨三十余根，新郑搜集站于三月十七日派员前往洽运，抵达该处时，见桥边钢轨只有十七根了，而旁边尚有十几根钢轨的印迹，当时扶沟县政府推卸不知，经访问附近居民查明，在一星期前有四辆马车将原有的三十五根运走了一部分，后在装卸行找出实证，系十三日有周口市益民铁工厂（淮阳专署开办的）运去一十八根，听说是拿去打铁锹的（修河用），并有扶沟县政府命令。结果县政府也找出淮阳专署的命令来了，搜集队即电周口市政府，千万不要将钢轨毁坏，市府秘书回电说：奉淮阳专署命令，十八根已全部毁了，打成铁锹，并说专署正派人往各县收集铁轨。
    现在国家正大力恢复建设铁路，这些器材自己还不能大量制造，须要向国外购买，如由苏联运一根钢轨到郑州，光运费就要合人民币四百多万元（现时运价）所以一根钢轨是不容易来的，铁道部与政府已下过数次搜集旧铁轨的指示，淮阳专署当系明知故犯，这种本位主义轻视国家整体利益的行为，应深刻检讨，并希上级给以适当的处理。

    编者按：这信件原载四月七日长江日报，该报编者指出：这种情况的存在，是由于淮阳专署与扶沟县府周口市府，存在着严重的本位主义的原故。虽然他们的动机是为了“打铁锹修河”，也是从群众利益出发的，但他们没有考虑到人民整体的利益，在客观上就犯了毁坏国家资材的错误。我们同意这个意见。
