　　CCP Village Branch Leads Production Effectively: Ren Qianhu Balances Spring Planting and Sideline Occupations

[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Li Wen reports: In the Ren Qianhu Village of the Ninghe disaster area in Hebei Province, agricultural and sideline production are being combined, and spring planting has been largely completed. The village suffered severe disasters last autumn, and the autumn harvest was not collected. Villagers relied on production activities such as fish management and weaving straw bags to survive. Of the 1,554 mu of cultivated land in the village, with the exception of more than 300 mu of waterlogged depressions, 820 mu have been sown with spring wheat and more than 300 mu with sorghum (only 32 mu have not been planted due to wet ground). Thanks to the division of labor and leadership by village cadres, and the rational organization of labor, while planting, they also engaged in sideline activities such as weaving straw bags, running transportation, working as laborers on state-owned farms, and spinning yarn. They earned a total of more than 12,000 jin of rice, solving the problem of food rations for all disaster-stricken villagers during spring cultivation.

In late February, before the start of spring wheat planting, the village's CCP branch held a meeting to study the village's production issues. Based on the fact that more than 80% of the households in the village had no grain reserves and would have nothing to eat without sideline production, it was necessary to continue developing sideline activities; however, there were concerns about affecting the timely planting. The branch focused on studying the question of "how to balance agriculture and sideline occupations." They proposed a combination of the two: First, actively negotiate with nearby state-owned farms for contract work, where each laborer could earn seven or eight jin of rice per day in wages to solve the problem of food; second, freely combine into partnerships and mutual aid groups to plant spring wheat and sorghum on time; third, continue spinning and weaving straw bags, mobilize women to learn skills, and free up the forty-eight male laborers who were weaving straw bags, so that seventy or eighty laborers could be drawn out to work on the farm every day. In order to strengthen the branch's leadership over production, each branch committee member was assigned specific tasks: Branch Secretary Ren Zhan'ao (chairman of the village representative meeting) and Ren Guihong led the planting of sorghum and spring wheat; Deputy Branch Secretary Ren Denge helped the village chief negotiate contract work with the farm and organized and led the laborers to work; Liu Jinxiang helped Zhang Yongfang (a non-Party cadre) lead the straw bag industry and transportation activities.

Because the branch's measures met the needs of the masses in the village, the above proposals received enthusiastic support from the representatives present when they were discussed at the village representative meeting. Because the village leaders emphasized the voluntary and mutually beneficial combination, resolving the contradictions between agricultural and sideline occupations, various methods and approaches that were conducive to production emerged: For example, Ren Ruiyun's family of seven, with one laborer, no livestock, and a shortage of food, combined with Liu Jinrui, who had livestock. Jinrui planted his land (providing fodder), and he went to work on the farm, earning ninety-eight jin of corn, while also planting eight mu of spring wheat and four and a third mu of sorghum. Another example is Ren Yanling, who had a small animal, and he partnered with Ren Dehou, who had two laborers. Dehou's family left one laborer to plant sorghum, while Yanling and Dehou went to work on the farm as contract laborers, and Yanling's wife wove straw bags at home. In this way, planting sorghum, earning wages at the farm, and weaving straw bags were all not delayed. Some individuals went to work on the farm, and their land at home was planted in partnership with others, with the wages earned at the farm being shared by both parties. Some formed groups of eight or nine people to work on the farm, with the whole group taking turns, with whoever was supposed to plant sorghum staying at home, while the others worked harder, so that planting sorghum and earning wages could both be achieved.

### 中共村支部领导生产有办法  任千户春耕副业两不误

　　中共村支部领导生产有办法
    任千户春耕副业两不误
    【本报讯】记者力文报导：河北省宁河灾区任千户村农业副业生产结合进行，已大体完成春耕播种。该村去秋受灾严重，秋禾未收，村民依靠治鱼、织草袋等生产活动渡日。全村耕地一千五百五十四亩，除三百余亩积水洼外，已播种春麦八百二十亩，高粱三百余亩（只有三十二亩因地湿尚未种上）。由于村干部分工领导，合理地组织了劳力，在播种同时，结合了进行织草袋、跑运输、到国营农场做小工、纺线等副业活动，前后共赚米一万二千余斤，解决了全村灾民进行春季耕作时的口粮问题。
    二月下旬，春麦开始播种前，该村中共支部开会研究了全村生产问题，根据全村有百分之八十以上的人家没有积粮，不进行副业生产，马上便没吃的这一情况来说就必需继续发展搞副业活动；但是又怕影响按时播种。支部便着重研究了“怎样使农业副业两不误”的问题。提出两者结合的办法：一、主动向附近国营农场交涉包工，每天每个劳力可得工资米七、八斤，以解决吃粮；二、自由结合插伙互助，按时种上春麦、高粱；三、纺织、织草袋继续活动，发动妇女学习技术，腾出织草袋的四十八个男人劳力，这样每天就能抽出七八十个劳力去农场做工。为了加强支部对生产的领导，各支委并作了具体分工：支部书记任占鳌（村代表会主席）及任贵洪领导高粱、春麦的播种；支部副书记任登阁帮助村长与农场交涉包工，并组织带领劳力做工；刘晋祥帮助张永芳（非党干部）领导草袋业及运输活动。
    由于支部的这一措施切合全村群众的要求，当上述提议在村代表会上讨论时，得到出席代表们热烈的拥护。由于该村领导干部强调了自愿两利的结合，解决农副业的矛盾，就出现了多种多样的有利于生产的办法和方式：如任瑞云全家七口人，一个劳力，没有牲口，缺粮吃；他就与有牲口户刘金瑞结合，金瑞给他种地（给草料），他到农场做工，前后挣玉米九十八斤，同时八亩春麦，四亩三分高粱也种上了。另一种如任燕凌有一个小牲口，他和有两个劳力的任德厚插伙，德厚家留一劳力播种高粱，燕凌、德厚到农场做包工，燕凌老婆在家织草袋，这样一来，种高粱、去农场挣工资、织草袋三者都未耽搁。有的本人到农场做工，家中地与别人插伙种，在农场挣得工资双方分红。有的八、九个人结成小组去农场做工，全组轮流调剂，谁该种高粱谁在家，其他人多干些，这样也能使种高粱与挣工资两不误。
