Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: TASS reports: Soviet Deputy Minister of Forestry, Karganov, recently reported to the Central Committee of the Soviet Timber Industry Workers' Union on measures to further implement Stalin's plan to transform nature by planting protective forests for farmland this year, stating: This year, the afforestation area in the Soviet Union will reach 660,000 hectares, including 323,000 hectares in the European part of the Soviet Union. The scale of afforestation work will be one and a half times that of last year. Ninety percent of all work must be completed in the spring. This year, the government's investment in transforming nature will reach 1.3 billion rubles, three times that of last year.

1949 was the first stage of implementing Stalin's plan to transform nature. In the first year, dozens of protective forest stations and forest areas were established. The entire production process of these work units has been mechanized. Each protective forest station has twenty-five tractors, thirty planting machines, and three hundred various types of excavators and bulldozers, etc. One hundred and ten new protective forest stations will be established this year. Eighty of these protective forest stations have already started working. These protective forest stations are the most highly mechanized forest enterprises in the world. They prepare the land for mechanized afforestation and build reservoirs and ponds.
