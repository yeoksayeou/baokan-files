　　Ding County's Agricultural Technology Group
    Zhai Yuzi
    Based on the experience of agricultural technology extension work over the past year and the reflections in the work reports from various regions, the demand for agricultural science and technology among the masses is indeed urgent and important. However, how to get our existing simple science and technology (such as preventing and controlling various smuts, changing to improved varieties, and preventing and controlling pests, etc.) implemented by the vast number of working farmers through what kind of organization is a very arduous task. We have been exploring this work for several years. Last year (1949), we adopted the method of establishing an extension network (county farm) and rural technical groups. Over the past year, this method has yielded relatively some gains. Therefore, in 1950, we plan to continue to use this method and require counties with suitable conditions (land, housing, cadres, etc.) to universally establish county farms and, under the existing leadership, to establish rural technical groups as much as possible to strive for the progress of agricultural science and technology work. To this end, we will introduce the process of establishing rural technical groups by the Ding County Farm in Hebei Province last year.
    The establishment of the agricultural technology group in Ding County went through a considerable period of time. According to the seasons, different technologies (such as the cotton aphid control period, the millet armyworm control period, the vegetable insect period, the autumn seed selection and wheat seed soaking period, etc.) were promoted, and gradually established, improved, consolidated and expanded. After two periods, a total of 172 rural technical groups were established, each group consisting of 5 to 7 people, with a current total of 495 technical group members, including 65 female members, 6 labor heroes and models, and 17 members of the Communist Youth League. In order to facilitate leadership and based on the needs of the region and work, 13 technical extension stations have been established.
    There are two methods for establishing technical groups. One is to combine with administrative power, and deploy it by convening village production cadre meetings according to the work area. At the meeting, first explain the significance of establishing a technical group and the tasks of the technical group, and then the village cadres convene a village expanded cadre meeting, where everyone discusses and studies and proposes candidates, and after the individuals agree, everyone passes it. Finally, the technical team members selected by everyone are called together to have them elect the team leader again. The other is to discover activists in practical work (such as pest control and seed selection), train technicians, and then consult the village cadres and ask for their consent. Or use the farm's key extension households (demonstration households), let them play a leading role, and gradually absorb the masses to participate and improve their technology.
            Matters needing attention in establishing a technical group
    1. The establishment of technical groups should be strict and serious, to prevent village cadres from carelessly putting together numbers, or cadres from monopolizing, and other deviations. This is very easy to happen at present. For example, after the cadres of Beisongjia Village in the 13th District attended the deployment meeting in the district, they returned to the village and disregarded all conditions and came up with five people to make up the numbers, thinking that they had completed the task. As a result, three of the five people were lazy and not good at production, and the weeds in their fields grew taller than anyone else's fields. Another example is the cadres of Qingfengdian Village said: "This is easy to organize, we cadres will take care of it if others don't." These phenomena should be checked and corrected at any time.
    2. After the technical groups are established, the farm should be primarily responsible for the leadership, especially technical guidance, which must be carried out frequently according to the season. However, in the initial stage of establishment, the farm must be closely combined with the administration. There should be no idea of simply relying on administrative power. If it is established only by relying on administrative power, even if it is established, it is mostly an empty shell.
    3. The technical group is a professional production technology leading group in the village. Its use is different from other general department cadres. They should not be arbitrarily asked to cooperate in matters unrelated to their work. Ding County has also made this mistake. For example, the Chengguan Village government regarded the technical group as one more working department in his village, and asked them to do tasks such as tax collection and land measurement, which affected and reduced the role of the technical group.
    4. When the farm leads the technical group, such as arranging work, holding meetings, and doing various experiments, it should try to avoid taking up their production time, because they have the conditions of technical group members, they must be very enthusiastic about production, and they are very tight on production time, so when holding meetings with them to arrange work and do experiments, try to make use of the evening and noon break time. When they impart technology, such as soaking seeds, mixing seeds, selecting seeds, and using pesticides to kill insects, they should be patient and meticulous, and explain them clearly little by little.
    5. The promotion work of the technical group should be combined with the village cadres and primary school and civil school teachers. The technology that is determined to be promoted should be promoted to the masses through the village cadres, and publicized through the primary schools and civil schools.
    In addition, when the farm teaches them technology or gives them improved varieties, etc., when they have not fully accepted them ideologically and are not confident, the farm should take the initiative to propose signing a contract, guaranteeing full compensation for any losses, and eliminating any concerns and doubts in their minds. At the same time, it is necessary to grasp the activists, cultivate backbones, and create typical demonstrations to publicize with vivid practical results. In addition, in order to be cautious and responsible for the technology taught to them, they must watch them do it themselves to avoid mistakes.
    6. The qualifications of technical group members: They should be enthusiastic about agricultural production, work hard, be able to accept new scientific knowledge, and have prestige among the masses. For example, the conditions of the group members in Beigongcheng Village are still good, but they do not have high prestige among the masses, so his technology cannot be promoted. Village cadres who meet the conditions can also be absorbed to participate in the work of the technical group.
            Leadership methods and the role of the technical group
    In addition to adopting general leadership methods, the leadership of the technical group should also be given technical guidance with emphasis according to different seasons. Such as controlling cotton aphids, controlling millet armyworms, and selecting seeds. Before a season and the central task arrives, meetings of technical group leaders should be held separately according to the region and work content, or meetings should be held in the extension station as a unit to carry out technical extension experiments. For example, when millet armyworms occurred, the farm determined key villages, and used Zhaicheng and Houxinzhuang as breakthrough points to conduct experiments, which promoted the insecticidal work of many villages. When Houxinzhuang first started, the masses had no confidence in using pesticides to kill armyworms. The farm first conducted experiments in the land of technical team member Li Danzi. After the insects were killed, the masses in the whole village also asked to use pesticides to spray and control them.
    Because of the drought and no rain last spring, the technical group of Zhaicheng Village created a method of planting cotton by borrowing soil (first use a plow to turn the dry soil on the ground to both sides, and sow seeds in the wet soil below). Zhang Chao'san, the leader of the technical group in Dongban Village, lacked many seedlings because of no rain last spring, so he conducted a cotton seedling transplanting experiment, and the results were very good. He taught it to the masses, and completely made up for the lack of seedlings. The autumn flower picking and seedling supplementing were no less than the harvest of the original seedlings.
    Li Luosheng, a member of the technical group in Niucun Village, created a method of digging pits, using basins, putting water, and dripping sesame oil in the ground to catch mole crickets. He went to catch them every morning. Due to the proper method, he promoted 280 villagers in the whole village to start catching them, and caught more than 20,000 in half a month.
    During the autumn seed selection, the farm took Dongbuluogang and Gaotou Village as breakthrough points, which drove the seed selection work in many villages. Duan Luoxu, the leader of the technical group in Gaotou Village, personally went to the field to lead the masses to carry out plant selection during cotton seed selection. The technical group in the village also made a specific plan during the autumn seed selection, proposing the slogan that each group member would guarantee to drive five households of the masses. As a result, they selected 2,000 catties of Datouhuang millet seeds.
    Among the 172 rural technical groups in Ding County, 137 groups convened technical group research meetings according to the season during the autumn work. In the seed selection campaign, each group responded 100% to the government's seed selection call and carried out autumn seed selection work.
            The situation of the activities of two typical groups
    The technical group of Gaotou Village: The technical group of Gaotou Village has a total of seven people, and the leader is Duan Luoxu. He himself is enthusiastic about agriculture and has a spirit of research. When cotton aphids occurred last year, he first used tobacco water and ash water in his own cotton field to conduct experiments on controlling cotton aphids (the amount of blending is unknown). After the experiment was successful, he introduced the method to his group members Duan Liqiu and Cao Guixue. After the group members saw the effect again, the masses saw with their own eyes that the method was indeed effective, which caused many people to buy tobacco leaves to control cotton aphids. At this time, he also counted the number of people needed and implemented collective purchase, which saved everyone's effort and bought it cheaper. Finally, it was calculated that a total of 200 acres of cotton aphids were treated.
    Secondly, when millet armyworms had just emerged last year, most people did not pay attention to it. After he knew about it, he first convened a meeting of their technical team members, and discussed and discussed the treatment methods at the meeting. The methods they discussed, such as using armyworm vehicles, armyworm boats, organizing the masses to fight, etc., were introduced to the masses, and he contacted the farm to obtain a part of the medicine. The serious ones were treated with medicine, and the light ones were organized to use manual methods to fight. Finally, it was calculated that 40 acres were treated with medicine, and 420 acres were manually treated.
    In addition to leading and promoting others over the past year, he also carried out pure selection of Datouhuang millet seeds last year, and retained half an acre of seed area this year, and harvested 110 catties of improved varieties. After the millet he planted was increased in production through seed selection, he promoted 40 catties this year, and he cultivated seedlings of Nonglin No. 4 sweet potato (yam), and promoted 40,000 seedlings this year. He planted cotton in large ridges and carried out warm water soaking, and the cotton harvest this year was very good. In addition, he himself also raises Leghorn chickens (called foreign chickens by the masses), and promoted a total of 52 chicks and 400 Leghorn eggs in the past two years. Now he has 12 large chickens and plans to reproduce and promote them in the coming year.
    Over the past year, Duan Luoxu's technical group has convened a group research meeting every time a season arrives. They held a total of 13 meetings last year. In addition, he also serves as the director of extension stations in several villages. He not only leads the work in his own village, but also helps promote the work in neighboring villages. For example, in catching insects, he often takes time to go to other villages to introduce effective methods.
    The technical group of Zhaicheng Village: There are two technical groups in Zhaicheng Village, one is a male group and the other is a female group. Their work is to jointly convene a research meeting every time a production season arrives, determine the work, and proceed separately. They all use the evening when holding meetings and never delay production time. They usually pay attention to absorbing the opinions and experience of veteran farmers. After the specific plan is made, they divide the work and ensure the completion of the task. At the same time, they promote the determined method through village cadres and primary school teachers in the village. For example, when sowing cotton, it was dry and no rain, so they created a method of sowing by borrowing soil, and tried and promoted the use of warm water to soak cotton seeds. As a result, 380 households out of 575 households in the whole village adopted warm water soaking, accounting for 66% of the total households in the village. When millet armyworms occurred, they were poisoned with medicine, and the method of using and blending the medicine was taught to the masses and primary school students, with a total of 210 acres of insects killed with medicine. Under the leadership and drive of their technical group in the autumn seed selection work, the whole village selected a total of 13,600 catties of Huanong No. 4 millet seeds.

　　定县的农业技术小组
    翟雨滋
    根据一年来农业技术推广工作中的经验，和各地区工作汇报中的反映，农业科学技术工作在群众中的要求确实迫切和重要。但如何将我们现有简易的科学技术（如防除各种黑穗病、改种优良品种、和防除虫害等…），通过什么样的组织机构就可以使广大的劳动农民，去贯彻执行，又是个很艰巨的任务。几年来这个工作我们都是在摸索着进行。去年（一九四九）我们采用了建立推广网（县农场）和农村技术小组的方法。一年来，这个方法比较有点收获，因之一九五○年我们预计仍采用这种办法，并要求在有条件的（土地、房屋、干部等）县份，要普遍建立县农场，并在现有的领导力量下，尽量的建立农村技术小组，力求农业科学技术工作的进展。为此，特介绍河北省定县农场去年建立农村技术小组的经过情形。
    定县农业技术小组的建立，是经过相当时间，根据节季，推广不同的技术（如治棉蚜期、治谷子黏虫期、菜虫期、秋季选种和种麦浸种期等），逐渐建立并健全和巩固扩大起来的。经过两个时期，分别建立了一百七十二个农村技术小组，每组人数五至七人不等，现共有技术小组组员四百九十五人，其中妇女组员六十五人，劳动英雄模范六人，青年团团员十七人。为了便于领导，又根据地区和工作的需要，建立了十三个技术推广站。
    技术小组的建立方法，一种是结合行政，根据工作区域，分片召开村生产干部会议进行布置。会上先说明建立技术小组的意义和技术小组的任务，然后村干部再召开村扩大干部会议，在会上大家研究讨论，提出人选，经过本人同意大家通过。最后将大家评选出来的技术组员召集在一起，使他们再选出组长。另一种是在实际工作中（如杀虫选种）发现积极分子，培养技术人员，事后通过村干部，征求本人同意。或是利用农场的推广重点户（示范户），由他们起带动作用，逐渐吸收群众参加，提高其技术。
            建立技术小组应注意事项
    一、技术小组的建立，应该严格、认真，防止村干部马虎凑数，或干部包办等偏向。这在目前是很易发生的。如十三区北宋家庄村干部在区里参加布置会议后，回到村里就不顾一切条件，凑数的给想出了五个人，就算完成了任务。结果五个人里有三个是懒汉，不好生产，他们地里的草比谁家地里草长的都高。又如清风店村干部说：“这好组织，别人不干咱们干部包着。”这些现象，都该随时检查纠正。
    二、技术小组建立起来以后，在领导上、农场要负主要责任，特别是技术指导，必须根据季节，经常进行。但在开始建立时期，农场要与行政密切结合，不应有单纯依靠行政力量思想，如只靠行政力量建立，即便建立起来也多是个空架子。
    三、技术小组在村里是一个专业生产技术领导小组，在使用上不同其他一般部门干部，与他们工作无关的事情，不应随意的要他们来配合。在定县也犯过这个毛病，如城关村政权把技术小组认为是他村里又多了一个工作部门，征收工作，丈量土地工作都叫他们去作，结果影响和降低了技术小组的作用。
    四、农场对技术小组的领导，如布置工作、开会、作各种试验等，要尽量注意不占用他们的生产时间，因为他们既具备了技术组员的条件，对生产一定很热心，对生产时间抓的都很紧，所以与他们开会布置工作、作试验，要尽量利用晚上及午间歇晌时间。要求他们在传授技术时，如浸种、拌种、选种、药剂杀虫等办法，都应耐心细致，一点一滴的解说清楚。
    五、技术小组的推广工作，应经常与村干部及小学、民校教员结合起来。把确定推广的技术，通过村干部向群众推广，通过小学、民校给宣传出去。
    另外，农场教给他们的技术或交给他们的良种等，当他们在思想上未十足接受和信心不足时，农场应主动向他们提出订立合同，如有损失，保证全部赔偿，解除他们在思想上的任何顾虑和怀疑。同时必须抓住积极分子，培养骨干，作出典型示范，以活生生的实际成绩来作宣传。另外为了慎重负责教给他们的技术，必须亲眼看着，让他们自己动手试作一番，以免错误。
    六、技术小组组员的条件：要对农业生产热心、劳动好、能接受新的科学知识，并要在群众中有威信。如北宫城村的组员条件尚好，就是在群众中威信不高，结果他的技术就推不下去。具备条件的村干部，也同样可以吸收他们参加技术小组工作。
            领导方法和技术小组的作用
    对技术小组的领导，除采用一般的领导方法外，还要依据不同的季节，给以有重点的技术指导。如治棉蚜、治谷子的黏虫、选种等。当一个季节和中心工作到来前，要根据地区和工作内容，分别召开技术小组长会议，或是以推广站为单位召开会议，进行推广技术试验。如谷子发生黏虫时，农场确定了重点村，以翟城、侯辛庄为突击点，作出了试验，推动了不少村的杀虫工作。侯辛庄在初作时，群众对药剂杀黏虫都没有信心，农场首先在技术组员李旦子的地里作了试验，虫子治死后，全村群众也都要求使用农药喷治。
    翟城村技术小组去春因天旱不雨，创造了借土种棉花的办法（先用犁把地面上的干土翻到两边，在下边的湿土里播种）。东板村技术组长张超三因去春不雨，缺苗的很多，自己就作了棉花移苗的试验栽培，结果很好。他教给了群众，把缺苗完全补上了，秋后摘花补苗并不次于原苗的收获量。
    牛村技术小组组员李洛胜，自己创造了挖坑、用盆、放水、滴香油在地里捉蝼蛄的办法，每日早上去捉，由于办法得当，推动了全村二百八十户老乡下手捉，半个月就捉到了两万多条。
    在秋季选种时，农场以东不落岗、高头村为突击点，结果带动了好多村的选种工作，高头村的技术组长段洛绪在棉花选种时，亲自到地里领导群众施行棵选。该村技术小组在秋季选种时，并作出具体计划，提出每个组员保证带动五户群众的口号，结果选得了大头黄谷种二千斤。
    定县全县一百七十二个农村技术小组，在秋季工作中，有一百三十七个小组根据季节召开了技术小组研究会议，在选种运动中，每个小组都百分之百的响应了政府的选种号召，进行了秋季选种工作。
            两个典型小组活动的情形
    高头村的技术小组：高头村的技术小组一共七个人，组长是段洛绪，他本人热心农业，并有钻研精神。去年棉花生蚜虫时，首先在自家棉花地里用烟草水、灰水作了治棉蚜的试验（配合量不明），经试验成功后，就把这个办法介绍给他的组员段立秋和曹桂雪，经组员再次见到成效，群众亲眼看到这个办法确实有效，由此引起了好多群众要买烟草叶子治棉蚜。就在这个时候他又统计了大家需要的数量，实行集体购买，这样又节省了大家的工夫，买的还便宜，最后计算共计治了棉蚜二百亩。
    其次，去年谷子刚生黏虫时，一般群众多不注意，他知道后，首先召开了他们的技术组员会议，会上并研究讨论了治的办法，将他们讨论好的办法如使用黏虫车子、黏虫船、组织群众扑打等，都介绍给群众，并且他又与农场取得联系，取得一部分药品，严重的用药剂治，轻的组织群众用人工打，最后统计用药治四十亩，人工打四百二十亩。
    一年来他除领导和推动别人外，在去年他还进行了大头黄谷种子纯选，今年留了半亩种子区，收良种一百一十斤。自己种的谷子，经选种增产后，今年推广了四十斤，农林四号甘薯（山药），他养种了秧子，今年推广秧子四万株。他种棉花种的是大垅，并进行了温水浸种，结果今年的棉花收成很好。此外，他本身还养有来亨鸡（群众叫洋鸡），去年和前年二年中共推广小鸡五十二只，来亨鸡蛋四百个。现在他还有十二只大鸡，准备来年再作繁殖推广。
    一年来段洛绪的技术小组都是每逢一个季节到来时，就召开一次小组研究会议。去年一年他们共开了十三次会。另外他还担任着几个村的推广站站长，他不仅只带动领导本村的工作，而且还要帮助推动邻近村的工作。如在捕虫中，他常抽出时间到别村去介绍有效的办法。
    翟城村的技术小组：翟城村有两个技术小组，一个是男组，一个是妇女组，他们的工作都是在每一个生产季节到来时，就共同召开一次研究会，确定工作，分头进行。他们在开会时都是利用晚上，绝不耽误生产时间，平素注意吸取老农参加意见和经验。当工作具体计划后，便分工并保证完成任务，同时把确定的方法，通过村干部和本村小学教员进行推广。如播种棉花时天旱不雨，他们就创造了借土播种法，并又试作和推广棉花用温水浸种。结果在全村五百七十五户中，有三百八十户采用了温水浸种，浸种户占全村总户的百分之六十六强。谷子生黏虫时，用药剂毒杀，并将药剂使用和配合方法，教给了群众和小学生，共计用药剂杀虫二百一十亩。秋季选种工作，在他们的技术小组领导和带动下，全村共选华农四号谷种一万三千六百斤。
