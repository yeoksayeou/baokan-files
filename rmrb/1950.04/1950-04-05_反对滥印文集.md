　　Against Indiscriminate Printing of Collected Works
　　Wang Ziye
　　Writing articles and compiling and printing collected works are serious matters. Any writer with a sense of responsibility will treat them with a serious attitude. In the past, the bad habit of indiscriminately printing collected works in our old society was criticized sharply by Mr. Lu Xun more than once. Unfortunately, until now, even among writers who serve the people, this bad habit of indiscriminately compiling and printing collected works has not been completely changed.
　　Here, I would first like to cite "Miscellaneous Essays from the North Gazing Pavilion" written by Comrade Zhou Erfu as an example. Indeed, Comrade Zhou Erfu has written some good works, such as memories of Bethune and some news reports about the Jin-Cha-Ji anti-Japanese base area. But this cannot be a reason to defend "Miscellaneous Essays from the North Gazing Pavilion."
　　"Miscellaneous Essays from the North Gazing Pavilion" has 250 pages and contains more than 50 articles written by the author over the past fifteen years (1935-1949). Among them are his student works from his university days. If the article is good or has historical significance, even articles written in middle school can be included in the collection. However, one of the articles included in this book, "On Qu Yuan and His Works," is considered by the author himself to need to be "rewritten" if he were to look at it now. "But when I think of the many things piled up in front of me that need to be dealt with, I can't help but take a breath of cold air: where is there enough time to sort them out! For the time being, let it meet the readers in this form." (See the "Postscript" in the original book)
　　Some of the other essays may have had some meaning when they were published, but what is the point of reprinting them today?
　　Comrade Zhou Erfu also has a new collection of essays called "New Starting Point," which has some problems. For example, in the article "On Intellectuals," it begins by saying:
　　"The social special class of intellectuals is a product of the class society of private ownership countries. It arises with the occurrence of private ownership, develops with the development of private ownership, and will disappear with the elimination of private ownership."
　　To say that intellectuals as a special social class will disappear with the elimination of private ownership is a very vague statement, and may even give people the impression that intellectuals will no longer exist after the realization of socialism. In his report on the Soviet Constitution, Stalin said that after all the exploiting classes have been eliminated, "what remains is the working class. What remains is the peasant class. What remains is the intelligentsia." The intelligentsia still exists after the elimination of private ownership, just as the working class and the peasant class cannot be eliminated. As for the complete elimination of the division between manual and mental labor, that is a distant future, and it will not be eliminated as soon as private property is eliminated. I think Comrade Zhou Erfu's simple formula is wrong and harmful.
　　I can cite several other collections of essays similar to "Miscellaneous Essays from the North Gazing Pavilion." I think these kinds of collections should be carefully and responsibly reviewed by the authors themselves. What should be removed should be removed, what should be deleted should be deleted, and if there is no need, it is not necessary to publish them at all.
　　Publishing collections of essays is not a bad thing, but they must be of substance and significance. Indiscriminately finding some old things that have no practical significance for today to waste paper is a bad habit that should be criticized and opposed.
　　At present, readers' purchasing power is so difficult, and buying a book is such a solemn matter for readers, but some of our writers and publishers are indiscriminately compiling and printing them, which is worth reviewing.

### 反对滥印文集

　　反对滥印文集
    王子野
    写文章、编印文集是一件严肃的事情，凡是有责任感的作家，必然用认真的态度来对待它。过去我国旧社会里滥印文集的恶劣作风，鲁迅先生曾经不只一次地作过尖刻的批评。可惜直到现在，甚至在为人民服务的作家中，这种滥编滥印文集的坏风气还没有彻底改变过来。
    在这里，我首先要举出周而复同志写的《北望楼杂文》来做例子。的确，周而复同志曾经写过一些好作品，如关于白求恩的回忆以及关于晋察冀抗日根据地的一些通讯报导。但是这并不能成为给《北望楼杂文》作辩护的理由。
    “北望楼杂文”有二百五十页，里面收集了作者十五年来（一九三五——一九四九年）写的五十多篇文章。其中有他在大学时代的习作。要是文章好，或者有历史意义，即使中学时代写的文章也未尝不可以收进文集。然而这本书里所收的一篇《关于屈原及其作品》是连作者本人现在看了也认为有“从新写过”之必要的。“但一想起堆在面前即待处理的那么多的事，不禁倒抽了一口冷气：那里有充裕的时间整理呢！暂时就以这样的面目去见读者吧。”（见原书《后记》）
    其余的一些杂文在发表时或许多少有点意义，但是今天重印出来，到底是为什么呢？
    周而复同志还有一本新的文集叫做《新的起点》，其中有些地方是很有问题的。例如在《论知识分子》一文里，劈头就说：
    “知识分子这个社会特殊阶层，是私有制国家阶级社会的产物，随着私有制度的发生而发生，随着私有制度的发展而发展，将随着私有制度的消灭而消灭。”
    说知识分子作为一个特殊的社会阶层将随着私有制度的消灭而消灭，这样的说法是很含糊的，甚至可能给人造成一种印象，似乎实现了社会主义之后，知识分子也就没有了。斯大林在论苏联宪法的报告里说，所有一切剥削阶级都被消灭了以后，“剩下的有工人阶级。剩下的有农民阶级。剩下的有知识界。”知识界在私有制度消灭之后还是存在的，正如工人阶级和农民阶级之不能消灭一样。至于体力劳动与脑力劳动分裂的完全消灭，那是遥远的将来的事，不是一经消灭了私有财产就跟着消灭的。我认为周而复同志的那个简单的公式是错误的，有害的。
    类似《北新楼杂文》这一类的文集，我还可以举出几种。我以为这类文集应当由作者本人加以认真负责的审查，该抽去的就抽去，该删的就删，如果没有必要，竟可不必出版。
    出文集并不是坏事，但必须出有分量、有意义的文集。随便找一些对今天没有现实意义的旧东西来浪费纸张，这是一种恶劣的作风，应当受到批评和反对。
    目前读者的购买力那么困难，买一本书在读者是多么郑重的一件事，而我们的有些作家和出版家却在滥编滥印，这是值得检讨的。
