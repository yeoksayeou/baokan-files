　　Beijing Municipal Street Consumer Cooperatives
    Diversify Operations to Reverse Stagnant Sales

    [This newspaper] Since the stabilization of prices in March, the Beijing Municipal Street Consumer Cooperatives have reversed their conservative thinking and actively expanded their business, initially reversing the phenomenon of stagnant sales. After commodity prices basically stabilized in March, many private merchants lowered their prices, some even lower than those of the cooperatives. Consequently, many members purchased goods from private merchants, leading to a general decline in sales for the cooperatives. For example, the city's street cooperatives sold 805,560 jin of grain in the first week of March, which decreased to 778,107 jin in the second week, and further dropped to 672,044 jin in the fourth week. The sales volume in the fourth week of March was 16.57% lower than in the first week.

    In response to this situation, the General Cooperative immediately instructed all consumer cooperatives to make business expansion and increased sales their central task. Work teams in various districts also helped cooperatives improve their operations. Everyone felt it was necessary to change past business methods, actively finding ways to sell goods, and decided to focus on increasing the variety of goods, making it convenient for members to purchase, ensuring good quality and low prices, developing welfare services, particularly strengthening the idea of serving members and strengthening contact with members. The 8th District Cooperative established four branches in March and delivered goods to members, which was greatly supported by the members, who said, "I didn't expect the cooperative to deliver goods!" Members Li Mingjiu and Yin Dama actively promoted the benefits of the cooperative to the masses. Many people joined the cooperative. The number of new members in the fourth week of March increased by 30.7% compared to the first week. The 3rd and 4th Street Cooperative of the 3rd District set up a stall in the Chaoyang Market and sent a cadre to push a cart to sell goods at the doorsteps of members who lived far from the cooperative. The 7th District Cooperative added a vegetable section. The 12th and 2nd District Cooperatives established four canteens. These measures solved significant problems for the members, and the cooperative's business quickly expanded. All cooperatives extended their sales hours, increased processing services, and reduced profits. After half a month of efforts, the sales volume of the street consumer cooperatives in the first week of April had increased by 12.8% compared to the fourth week of March. By district, the 2nd District increased by 11.34%, and the 3rd District increased by 12.23%.

　　京市街道消费合作社
    多方开展业务扭转滞销状态
    【本报讯】北京市街道消费合作社扭转保守思想，积极开展业务，已初步转变了物价稳定以来滞销的现象。自从三月份起，物价基本上稳定后，许多私商降低售价，有的比合作社的价钱还低，因而社员到私商处买东西的很多，合作社的售货量普遍降低。如全市各街道合作社三月份第一周售粮八十万五千五百六十斤，第二周降至七十七万八千一百零七斤，第四周更降至六十七万二千零四十四斤，三月份第四周的售货额比第一周降低了百分之十六·五七。
    总社针对这种情况，当即指示各消费社必须把开展业务、扩大售货额做为中心任务。各区工作组也帮助各社改进业务。大家都感到必须改变过去的经营方式，积极想法销售物资。并决定从增加货品种类、使社员购货方便、作到质好、价低、开展福利事业，特别是加强为社员服务的思想和与社员联系等几方面着手。八区社三月份建立了四个分社，并给社员送货，社员非常拥护，说：“没想到合作社还管送货！”社员李鸣九、尹大妈积极向群众宣传合作社的好处。群众入社的很多。三月份第四周入社者比第一周增加了百分之三○·七。三区三四街社在朝阳市场设了一个摊，派一个干部推着车到离社远的社员家门口卖货。七区合作社增设了一个青菜部。十二区、二区社设立了四个食堂。这些都给社员解决了很大问题，合作社业务很快得到开展。各合作社都延长了售货时间，增添加工事业，并减低了利润。经半月的努力，各街道消费社四月份第一周的售货额，已较三月份第四周的售货额增加了百分之一二·八；以区来说，二区增加了百分之十一·三四，三区增加了百分之十二·二三。
