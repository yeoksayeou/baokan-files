　　Striving for the Bolshevik Party Spirit and High Artistic Skill in Soviet Literature
    By K. Simonov, translated by Jin Ren
    Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in the third issue of the journal "Bolshevik" (published in February 1950). The author emphasizes that Soviet writers and critics should be loyal to the principle of the Party spirit in literature and the method of socialist realism, must deeply familiarize themselves with and diligently study real life, study Marxism-Leninism, and create works with high ideological content and high artistic quality in raising and resolving a number of major national issues. The author analyzes and criticizes some literary works containing shortcomings, such as "In Support of Soviet Power," "Moscow Character," and "Great Art." At the same time, he points out that some Soviet critics, when sharply and severely criticizing works, did not point out ways to revise the shortcomings of the works. This means that those critics are unwilling to help Soviet literature and lack a caring attitude towards writers, acting merely as emotionless bystanders. On the other hand, the author also criticizes that kind of formalistic, propagandistic literary criticism—praising throughout, forgiving shortcomings, not analyzing artistic skills, simply repeating the content of the work, and habitually citing a few minor shortcomings at the end as a concluding remark. He believes that critics and writers alike must have a particularly deep and concrete understanding and comprehensive study of the important aspects of real life. Finally, Simonov points out that in the editorial departments of some Soviet literary journals, camaraderie and sectarianism should be eliminated, and the work of criticism and self-criticism and a humble attitude should be strengthened. An abridged translation of this article has been published in the thirteenth issue of "Literary Gazette." At the same time, the fifth and sixth issues of "People's Literature" also translated and published the criticism of Katayev's "In Support of Soviet Power." Both articles are worthy of our attention and study.

　　Soviet literature serves our people and all progressive humanity very faithfully. Our writers have created many brilliant works, which have become powerful tools in cultivating the communist spirit of the working people, especially the youth.

　　Lenin once said: "Literature should become partisan. In opposition to bourgeois habits, to the bourgeois commercial and huckstering press, to bourgeois literary careerism and pursuit of gain—the principle of partisan literature should be advanced and developed in full and complete form by the socialist proletariat."

　　This great call of Lenin has been realized. Soviet literature is Party literature and is responsible for the vital interests of our people in their struggle for the cause of communism. The question is to realize the principle of Party spirit in literature in a particularly complete and perfect form, and it is not allowed to violate this principle.

　　Comrade Stalin called writers "engineers of the human soul." To live up to this lofty title, it is only under this condition—that is, the writer must depict reality in revolutionary development, combine the truthfulness of artistic depiction with historical specificity and the task of educating the working people with the ideological spirit of the Lenin-Stalin Party; only such artistic literature and literary criticism can be called the method of socialist realism.

　　The achievements of Soviet literature show that Soviet literature is based on the principle of the Bolshevik Party spirit. For the first time in human history, clear and great tasks have been put before literature, and these tasks are closely linked with the living reality of the hundreds of millions of people in our country and with the struggle of the working masses all over the world. The task of Soviet literature is consciously and inseparably combined with communist ideas. The responsibility borne by our literature is indeed enormous, and for an artist who is fortunate enough to live and create in an era when literature and art have become part of the overall proletarian cause, happiness is immense.

　　It is very sad and shameful if a loyal Soviet artist loses his way from the path that has shown his noble role in Soviet society. In order to prevent this from happening, the writer must be well acquainted with Soviet real life and must study hard.

　　A writer must be familiar with many things. He should study Marxism-Leninism, and he should learn revolutionary ideas from the classical theorists of scientific communism—Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

　　The writer must learn to see the new things that are happening in life, bravely and heroically grasp these new things, support them, and promote them. Learn from the advanced laborers of our society. Only by learning from the most advanced things in life and depicting the intense activities engaged in by the people in his own works can he truly cultivate the communist spirit of the Soviet people.

　　Finally, learning—that is to say, in order for the writer to critically grasp the great experience of the social struggle being carried out for the beautiful future of the people, this experience is accumulated by the advanced classical Russian literature. In this case, one cannot forget the peak of artistic skill reached by 19th-century Russian classical literature.

　　All the Party's decisions on literature and art issues require artists to be loyal to the principle of Party spirit and the method of socialist realism, and to always and without exception place the task of perfecting artistic skills and artistic forms before them.

　　The demand for the historically specific artistic depiction of reality, for a deep and comprehensive study of life, for understanding the process of life, and for supporting the new and advanced things that are produced in our society every day runs like a red thread through all the instructions the Party has given to our literature and our art in recent years. A writer who does not fulfill this requirement cannot master the high skills of socialist realism, nor can he create highly artistic works.

　　When Zhdanov spoke at the Congress of Soviet Musicians on behalf of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), he said: "You may find it strange that the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party is actually asking for musical beauty and elegance. What new misfortune is this? Yes, we are not mistaken. We declare our support for beautiful, elegant music, for music that can satisfy the aesthetic needs and artistic tastes of the Soviet people, and these needs and tastes are incredibly increasing." It should be said that Zhdanov's words are directly related to literature!

　　True skill begins with a deep study of real life, a correct understanding of real life, and a correct expression of advanced and backward tendencies. For a Soviet artist, there is no and can never be skill outside of a deep study of real life. As soon as he breaks away from life, as soon as he stops diligently studying life and analyzing life—he loses skill, and in the opinion of his readers, he loses his qualifications as an artist. Once a writer violates the principle of Party spirit and the method of socialist realism, he also loses the most beautiful colors on his artistic palette, losing those colors that arise from life and cannot be realized outside of a correct understanding and description of this life.

　　The Party has repeatedly called on Soviet artists to create works of high ideology and high art using the method of socialist realism.

　　When elucidating the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "Resolution on the Magazines 'Zvezda' and 'Leningrad'," Zhdanov said that Zoshchenko's works were intolerable to Soviet literature, saying that Zoshchenko depicted the Soviet order and the Soviet people as ugly, in cartoon form, and that "he is not interested in the labor of the Soviet people, their efforts and heroism, or their noble social and moral qualities," that is, he is not interested in the basic and main things in Soviet real life.

　　The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the programs performed in theaters emphasized that the reason why the work of many playwrights is unsatisfactory is that they violate the principles of socialist realism, they stray from the path of correctly depicting real life, because "many playwrights are far away from the many basic problems of the present, are not familiar with the lives and demands of the people, and are not good at depicting the excellent characteristics and qualities of the Soviet people."

　　The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in exposing the shortcomings of the film "The Great Life," said that the film "only depicts a small episode in the first stage of the restoration of the Donbass, and it cannot correctly convey the true vigor and significance of the restoration work carried out by the Soviet state..."

　　All these Party resolutions point out how a superficial study of life, if incorrect, will lead an artist to tragic results. Distortion of real life in artistic works usually occurs on the basis of unfamiliarity with life, and on the basis of an artist falling behind the development of advanced Soviet people. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the film "The Great Life" emphasized that the authors of the film "do not understand that in our country, people with cultural cultivation, modern people, and people who are very familiar with their own careers are highly valued and bravely promoted, rather than highly valuing and bravely promoting those who are backward and uneducated..." As for artists who are detached from life and unfamiliar with life, as the resolution says, "the main shortcoming in their work is that they do not study the cause that many people are fighting for."

　　Zhdanov touched on this issue again in his report at the conference of Soviet musicians convened by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He said about Muradeli's opera "The Great Friendship": "The story in the opera is artificial, and the events reflected in the opera are historically incorrect and false." He also said: "This is a rude historical error, a falsification of true history, and a destruction of historical truth."

　　When criticizing the shortcomings of Fadeyev's novel "The Young Guard," the Party newspaper emphasized that the real life of the Bolsheviks behind enemy lines was not correctly depicted in the novel. The image of the underground workers in the novel did not obtain true typicality, nor did it reach the height of artistic synthesis that the author wanted to mention for the members of the Young Guard.

　　When criticizing Simonov's novella "Smoke of the Fatherland," the Party newspaper also emphasized that the author's fundamental error was that he did not have sufficient observation preparation to express new characters and Soviet patriots in real life as vivid artistic images. As a result, the author's creative ideas did not obtain complete and valuable artistic expression. The content of the novel became not a concretization of the depiction of socialist real life, but a partial shadow of the times.

　　When criticizing Sofronov's script, the Party newspaper again emphasized that the author's error was due to his poor research on life in this script, which deviated from the path of socialist realism. Sofronov did not express the living, true Soviet collective in his script, nor did he express the guiding and organizational role of the Party organization in the factory.

　　After Sofronov's script, Koshevnikov's flawed script "Fire River" appeared. The main reason for the author's failure was due to his lack of familiarity with life, the incorrect description of the script, and the fabrication and forgery of dramatic conflicts.

　　When criticizing Melnikov's novella "Editorial Department," our Party newspaper noted that in this novella, the staff of the Bolshevik newspaper on the front line were placed in a simply false situation, and noted that the author did not use the vivid phenomena of front-line life as the basis of the work, but used his own dry literary fabrication as the basis, and the protagonists of the work had nothing in common with the representatives of Soviet journalists.

　　The Party newspaper also criticized the young writer Alexei Chirkasov's novel "The Days That Began in the East" because of the incorrect depiction of real life. The author was criticized for replacing the depiction of the prospectors' collective with the depiction of the hereditary life of the Muravyev family, because the Party organization was not expressed in the novel, nor were the Stakhanovites. The prospectors worked in the old way, and it was not obvious that they possessed any modern technology. It was pointed out very fairly that there was a contempt for real life in the novel, real life was not understood correctly, and the description of life was replaced by the search for artificial plots and cheap tastes.

　　A very fine and extensive criticism of the errors that a writer who does not sufficiently and deeply study the materials that constitute the content of his work is bound to make was recently put forward in Bubennov's essay on Katayev's novel "In Support of Soviet Power," which was published in "Pravda." The specific examples cited in this essay illustrate the particularly serious shortcoming of Katayev's novel—that is, it does not conform to the truth of life.

　　The Party requires Soviet literature to be deeply familiar with real life and to describe it correctly, and expects the works produced by Soviet writers to be not photographic copies, not naturalistic descriptions of life, but a deep understanding of the process of social development, or only such an understanding can correctly describe social life.

　　The Party requires writers, in order to be able to delve into the essence of life and its movement, to select the excellent feelings and qualities of the Soviet people, to whip the backward and outdated things, and to systematically and consciously express how, like today, the labor of the people of socialist society can create our future days.

　　This is why the question of the choice of a character or several characters in a work cannot be determined by the author's sudden wishes or intentions. The correct and reasonable solution to this problem can greatly determine the face of the work. The author uses the choice of characters to answer the question of to whom he pays important attention, and whom he will devote all his genius to describe; describe a person who concentrates all the new and advanced things in our society, or describe a person who holds on to the backward, old, and dying things.

　　From the answer to this question, we can know the author's attitude towards real life, how—correctly or incorrectly—he understands it, whether he correctly sees the progressive trends of real life, whether these trends are the most important and most precious in our life for him, and whether he is trying to contribute all the strength of his genius and all the enthusiasm of his heart to this most precious thing.

　　If we take Katayev's novel "In Support of Soviet Power" as an example and ask ourselves, who should be the center of new and advanced things in the novel, who should be the center of confidence in victory, the Party's firmness, the Party's uncompromisingness, and Bolshevik enthusiasm, then it is simply very clear that the secretary of the underground district committee who leads the activities of the people left in the tomb—Gavrik Chernivanenko—should be such a person. But does he become such a person in Katayev's novel? The answer to this question is no.

　　Katayev's failure is because the author did not pay attention to the most important and advanced things in the real life he described. This basic error casts its shadow on the entire novel. Many of the characters themselves are very vivid and correct. If the author could have first correctly described the person who led the backward characters in the novel, then these characters could also be expressed as another, incomparably positive life.

　　Such a lack of the method of socialist realism and the superficial study of life have led a famous Soviet writer to produce essential errors in his works.

　　The contempt for criticism and the extraordinary unfamiliarity with the lives of the Soviet people led another famous Soviet writer, Panfyorov, to make similar errors in his recently published novel "The Great Art."

　　In this novel, which is a sequel to his previous two novels—"Struggle for Peace" and "In the Country of the Conquered"—the author's goal is to show the work of the Great Ural Automobile Factory, to show the Stakhanov workers of the factory, to show its Party organization, and to depict the future fate of the old heroes of the factory—Nikolai Kolabrev and Tatyana Borovtseva.

　　In the novel, an evil character—the factory director Kokolev—is set against the positive image of Nikolai Kolabrev—a good Communist Party member, who, according to the author's idea, is an advanced careerist. This character appears to the reader as a person who is greedy for fame and fortune and ambitious, with a barbaric style of work and a bad attitude towards workers. Later, it was found that Kokolev—was just a saboteur and an American spy. After Kokolev-Nelson was exposed, Kolabrev became the factory director again, and he quickly restored the factory's work. The general conception of the event can be viewed in this way.

　　Regrettably, Panfyorov described the work of a large Soviet factory with a large number of workers and a huge Party organization, all of which essentially only serve as a background. First, the hostile, destructive force—Kokolev-Nelson—operates in this background, and later—the active, creative force—Nikolai Alabrev operates on it.

　　A stubborn saboteur and spy who drills into the position of factory director of a Soviet factory will certainly bring a lot of damage. However, I am afraid that in our Soviet real life, Kokolev would not be allowed to trample the strong Party organization under his feet and deceive a large number of workers in such a rude way that exposes himself, even for a short period of time.

　　Panfyorov, due to the lack of the method of socialist realism, lowered the level of consciousness of the Soviet working class, lowered the role and significance of the Party organization, not to mention the methods used by the Soviet people to fight against the sabotage of the Soviet system, and he simply described it incorrectly.

　　The author tried to describe a particularly clear image of a saboteur and spy, Kokolev, and indeed created an unforgettable image of a villain on many pages of the novel. However, he exaggerated Kokolev's actions to the extent that he openly did evil and openly opposed the Soviet elements, exaggerated to the extent that his bad behavior was obvious at a glance, but he dragged on for many pages in the novel and forced many excellent (according to the author's fabrication) and clever Soviet people to lose their way in this sense of real life. The author crudely distorted the truth of life, distorted the images of these characters, and lowered them. If Kokolev really acted like he did in the novel, so openly anti-Soviet, then the people around him—such as the organizer of the Party Central Committee, Luken, the chief engineer, Alitman, and many factory workers—would not immediately see what this director was.

　　Panfyorov violated the truth of life, and in order to cater to cheap tastes, he so highlighted and exaggerated the evil character of Kokolev, and at the same time impoverished the images of the loyal Soviet people.

　　Panfyorov also has many failures in the basic positive character—Nikolai Kolabrev. The author wanted to fabricate Kolabrev as an extraordinary and excellent person. But Panfyorov chose a very objectionable method to describe Kolabrev, that is, by constantly emphasizing his achievements and infinitely exaggerating his enthusiasm.

　　Advanced people like Kolabrev exist in our lives. They are closely linked to real life by thousands of lines, and they do not break away from life. Their strength lies precisely in this. Panfyorov's Kolabrev is lifted above real life, and the real life described in the novel itself is mostly artificially manufactured, because the author needs this so that the fate of the protagonist—Nikolai Kolabrev—can be changed in this way or that way.

　　For example, at the end of the war, Kolabrev, who lived in the concentration camp of the German fascist bandits, as soon as he was released, as soon as he contacted the Soviet headquarters, many marshals, commanders, and generals called each other and spread the news throughout Germany: "Kolabrev has been found." This is not the end. The author's description of Kolabrev's return to the Soviet Union is really too much. He wrote: "The news about Nikolai Kolabrev's arrival flew like a bird to Moscow, to Leningrad, Stalingrad, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, along the Volga River..."

　　Within a few days after Kolabrev returned to the factory, he became the director of the factory again, and he built the system in a very short period of time. All this happened surprisingly quickly. The author artificially swept away the obstacles under the feet of his protagonist, and these obstacles actually need people to overcome in life.

　　As a result, the impression is that Kolabrev—is a superman, everything is easy for him to grasp, and the "flying carpet" and "tablecloth that can conjure up food" (both stories in "One Thousand and One Nights"—translator's note) are prepared for him. It gives the impression that the factory was rebuilt from the terrible situation caused by Kokolev not due to the efforts of the factory collective, but only due to the personal efforts of Kolabrev.

　　However, it is known that there is no such thing as a perfect person. In such a huge cause as promoting the progress of the entire factory, the powerful collective led by the Party organization plays a major role. And in order to express the merits and great talents of the leader, there is no need to overemphasize the merits and talents of this person to be fictional and unparalleled.

　　The episode in the novel where Kolabrev masters the new profile of the factory is very characteristic. At first, Kolabrev sat, immersed in piles of English and German books, from which he did not get new truths, because in the capitalist production system, the entire technological process is built on the separation from the workers—in fact, the people who produce the machines—so the conclusion that "this is not useful to us" is not a new conclusion. In order to prove this truth, which is already familiar to any Soviet person, Kolabrev ordered a lot of materials from the Moscow Automobile Factory, and while studying them, he shouted: "This is—what we need!"

　　Later, Kolabrev decided to study the work of this factory and flew to Moscow. He visited the factory director and visited the conveyor device with him, stayed there for a few hours, and flew back on the same day. What does this method of "mastering experience" have in common with the method of seriously studying the experience of advanced factories that actually happens in our country?

### 为苏维埃文学的布尔什维克党性与高度的艺术技巧而斗争

　　为苏维埃文学的布尔什维克党性与高度的艺术技巧而斗争
    Ｋ·西蒙诺夫作  金人译
    编者按：本文原载《布尔什维克》杂志第三期（一九五○年二月出版）。作者强调指出苏维埃作家和批评家应忠实于文学的党性的原则和社会主义现实主义的方法，必须深刻地熟悉和顽强地学习现实生活，学习马列主义，创造在提出和解决若干巨大国家问题上具有高度思想和高度艺术的作品。作者分析了和批评了一些含有缺点的文学作品，如《拥护苏维埃政权》、《莫斯科性格》、《伟大的艺术》等。但同时，他指出有一些苏维埃批评家在尖锐地严厉地批评作品的时候，没有指出修改作品缺点的途径。这就是说，那一些批评家不愿意帮助苏维埃文学，缺乏对作家的关心的态度，而仅仅是一些毫无感情的旁观者。另一方面，作者也批评了那种形式主义的、宣传性质的文学批评——整篇赞美，宽恕缺陷，对艺术技巧不分析，只是将作品内容复述一遍，在文章结尾时照例地举出几处小缺点作为结束语。他认为批评家和作家同样须对现实生活的重要方面有特别深刻的具体的认识和全面的研究。最后，西蒙诺夫指出，在若干苏维埃文学机关刊物的编辑部中，应该消灭友情关系和宗派主义，加强批评与自我批评工作和谦逊的态度。这一篇文章的节译已刊登于第十三期《文艺报》上。同时，第五、六期《人民文学》也译载了对卡塔耶夫的《拥护苏维埃政权》的批评。两文均值得我们重视和学习。                                            
    苏维埃文学是很忠实地为我们的人民和全体进步人类而服务的。我们的作家们创作了不少天才的作品，这些作品在培养劳动者，特别是培养青年的共产主义精神上都成为有力的工具。
    列宁曾经说过：“文学应当成为党的。针对着资产阶级的习性，针对着资产阶级雇主和商人的出版物，针对着资产阶级文学的功名主义和个人主义，“绅士式的无政府主义”与利欲的追求，——社会主义的无产阶级应当提出党的文学原则，发展这个原则，并使之在尽可能圆满和完整的形式上实现。”
    伟大列宁这一号召是实现了。苏维埃文学是党的文学，在我们人民为共产主义事业的斗争中，是要对他们的切身利益负责的。问题就在于要使文学上的党性的原则在特别圆满和完整的形式上实现，是不允许违背这个原则的。
    斯大林同志称作家为“人类灵魂的工程师”。要证实这个崇高的称号，只有在这种条件之下——就是文学家要描写出革命发展中的现实，把艺术描写的真实性与历史的具体性和以列宁——斯大林党的思想精神来教育劳动者的任务结合起来，只有那样的艺术文学和文学批评的方法我们才把它叫做社会主义现实主义的方法。
    苏维埃文学的成就说明了苏维埃文学是有布尔什维克党性的原则作为其基础的。在人类历史上清楚的和伟大的任务首次提到了文学的面前，这些任务是和我国的千百万人民的生活现实，是和全世界的劳动群众的斗争，紧密联系着的。苏维埃文学的任务是有意识地和不可分裂地与共产主义的思想相结合着。我们的文学所负担的责任确实是很巨大的，而且对于一个有运气能在文学和艺术成为总的无产阶级事业的一部分的时代生存和创作下去的艺术家，幸福是很巨大的。
    如果一个忠实的苏维埃的艺术家，从指示了他的在苏维埃社会中的这种高贵作用的道途上迷失了方向，那是很悲痛和很可耻的。为了不发生这种情况，作家必需很好地熟悉苏维埃的现实生活，而且顽强地去学习。
    作家一定要熟悉很多东西。他应当学习马列主义，他应当向科学的共产主义的古典理论家们——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林——学习革命的思想。
    作家要学习能看到那种在生活中发生的新事物，勇敢地和英气勃勃地掌握这种新的事物，拥护它并且加以宣传。要向我们社会的先进劳动者们学习。只有向生活中最先进的东西学习，在自己的作品中描写出人民所从事的强烈活动，就可以真正培养苏维埃人的共产主义精神。
    最后，学习——这就是说为了使作家能批判地掌握那种为了人民的美好未来而从事的社会斗争的巨大经验，这种经验是由先进的古典的俄罗斯文学所积累起来的。在这种情况下是不能忘掉十九世纪的俄国古典文学所达到的那种艺术技巧的高峰的。
    党对于文学与艺术问题上的一切决定，都要求艺术家们忠实于党性的原则和社会主义现实主义的方法，永远而且无例外地把完成艺术技巧，完成艺术形式的任务摆到他们面前。
    对于艺术地描写现实的历史具体性的要求，对于深刻地，全面地研究生活，了解生活的过程，对于拥护那种每天在我们的社会中所产生的新的、先进事物的要求，就像一道红线一样贯穿了党在最近这些年来针对我们的文学和我们的艺术所作的一切指示。一个作家不履行这个要求，就不能掌握社会主义现实主义的高度技巧，也不能创造高度艺术的作品。
    日丹诺夫在苏维埃音乐工作者大会上，以联共（布）中央委员会的名义演讲时说过：“你们也许会觉得奇怪，布尔什维克党中央委员会竟要求音乐上的美丽和优雅。这算什么新的不幸呢？是的，我们并没有说错，我们声明拥护美丽的，优雅的音乐，拥护能满足苏维埃人的美的要求和艺术趣味的音乐，而且这种要求和趣味是令人难信地上涨了。”应当说，日丹诺夫这些话对于文学是有直接关系的！
    真正的技巧是从深刻地研究现实生活，正确地了解现实生活，正确地表现出先进的和落后的倾向而开始的。对于一个苏维埃艺术家，没有而且也不可能有处在深刻研究现实生活以外的技巧。只要他一脱离开生活，只要他一停止热心地研究生活，分析生活，——他就失掉技巧，在其读者的意见中就会失掉作为艺术家的资格。作家一破坏党性的原则，一破坏社会主义现实主义的方法，同时他就会失掉自己的艺术调色板上的最优美的颜色，失去那些在生活中产生的，而在正确了解和描述这种生活之外所不能实现的色彩。
    党屡次号召苏维埃的艺术家们用社会主义现实主义的方法创作高度思想、高度艺术的作品。
    日丹诺夫在阐述联共（布）中央“对《星》及《列宁格勒》两杂志的决议”时说过，左琴科的作品是为苏维埃文学所不能容忍的，说左琴科把苏维埃的秩序和苏维埃人都描绘成丑陋的，漫画形式，“他对苏维埃人的劳动，对他们的努力与英雄主义，对他们的高尚的社会的与道德的品质，丝毫不感兴趣，”也就是说对苏维埃现实生活中的基本事物与主要事物不感到兴趣。
    在联共（布）中央关于剧场上演节目的决议中强调指出，许多剧作家的工作不能令人满意的原因是由于他们破坏了社会主义现实主义的原则，他们远离了正确描写现实生活的道路，因为“许多剧作家都远离开当前的许多基本问题，不熟悉人民的生活与要求，不善于描写出苏维埃人的优秀特征与品质。”
    联共（布）中央的决议，在揭露影片《伟大的生活》的缺点时说到，影片“只是描写顿巴斯恢复的第一阶段的一个小插曲，它并不能令人正确地体会到由苏维埃国家所执行的恢复工作的真正昂扬与意义……”
    这一切党的决议都指出，不正确的，对生活的表面研究会把一个艺术家导向如何悲惨的结果。在艺术作品中对现实生活的歪曲，照例是发生在对生活不熟悉的基础上，发生在一个艺术家落后于先进的苏维埃人的发展的基础上。在联共（布）中央关于影片《伟大的生活》的决议中强调指出，影片的作者们“不了解在我国对于有文化修养的，现代的，非常熟悉自己事业的人是会受到很高的评价，而且受到勇敢的推崇的，而不是很高地估价和勇敢地推崇那些落后的，没有文化教养的人们……”至于说到脱离开生活，不熟悉生活的艺术家们，正如在那个决议中所说，“他们工作中的主要缺点是在于他们不研究那种许多人为之而斗争的事业。”
    日丹诺夫在联共（布）中央召开的苏维埃音乐工作者会议上报告时又触及到这个问题。他针对着莫拉德里的歌剧《伟大的友情》说道：“歌剧中的本事是人为的，歌剧所反映的那些事件，从历史观点看来都是不正确和虚伪的。”又说：“这是粗卤的历史性的错误，对真正历史的伪造，对历史真相的破坏。”
    党报在批评法捷耶夫的长篇小说《青年近卫军》的缺点时强调指出，小说中对处在敌人后方的布尔什维克的现实生活是描写得不正确的。地下工作者的形象在小说中并没有获得真正的典型性，也没能达到作者把青年近卫军分子们要提到的那种艺术综合的高度。
    党报在批评西蒙诺夫的中篇小说《祖国炊烟》时也同样强调指出，作者的根本错误是由于他没有充分的观察准备，以便把新人物，把在实际生活中的苏维埃爱国者表现成为有血有肉的艺术形象。结果，作者的创造思想就没有获得完全有价值的艺术表现。小说的内容就成了并非描写社会主义现实生活的具体化，而是描写时代的局部影子。
    党报在批评梭甫洛诺夫的剧本时，又强调指出，作者的错误是由于他在这个剧本中对生活研究得很不好，离开了社会主义现实主义的道路。梭甫洛诺夫在其剧本中并未表现出活生生的，真正的苏维埃的集体，没有表现出党组织在工厂中的指导与组织作用。
    在梭甫洛诺夫的剧本之后，又出现了考舍甫尼柯夫的有瑕疵的剧本《火河》。作者失败的主要原因是由于对生活不够熟悉，由于剧本的不正确的描写，由于对戏剧冲突的臆造和伪制。
    我们党报在批评梅里尼柯夫的中篇小说《编辑部》时，又注意到在这篇小说中把前线的布尔什维克报纸的工作人员们安插在简直虚伪的境地中了，又注意到作者不是把前线生活的生动现象做为作品的基础，而是把自己的枯燥的文学臆造做为基础，作品的主角们和苏维埃新闻记者的代表人物丝毫没有共同之点。
    党报也批评了青年作家阿列克塞·契尔喀索夫的长篇小说《在东方开始的日子》，因为对现实生活描写得不正确。作者之所以受到批评是因为他用描写穆拉维耶夫家庭的因袭生活代替了描写探矿者的集体，因为在小说中没有表现出党的组织，没有斯达汉诺夫分子。探矿者们用古旧方式工作，看不出他们拥有任何的现代技术。很公正地指出，在小说里存在着对现实生活的轻视，现实生活被了解得很不正确，用寻觅人造情节和廉价趣味来代替对生活的描写。
    对一个不充分深刻研究构成其作品内容的材料的作家所必不可免要犯的那些错误的非常精细的和广泛的批评，不久以前在刊登于《真理报》上的布宾诺夫所写有关卡塔耶夫的长篇小说《拥护苏维埃政权》的论文中都提出来了。在这篇论文中所举出的具体例子中说明卡塔耶夫的小说特别严重的缺点——这就是不合于生活的真相。
    党要求苏维埃文学要深刻熟悉现实生活及对其正确的描写，盼望苏维埃作家所产生的作品不是照相一般的翻版，不是对生活的自然主义的描绘，而是对社会发展过程的深刻理解，或者说只有这样的理解才有可能正确地描写社会生活。
    党要求作家，为了使之能深入生活及其运动的本质，选取苏维埃人的优良感情与品质，鞭笞落后的和过时的东西，有计划地和自觉地表现出，像今天似的，用社会主义社会的人们的劳动是可以造成我们未来的日子的。
    这就是为什么特别是对作品的一个人物或若干人物的选择问题不能由作者突然发生的愿望或意气来决定的道理。对这个问题的正确的和合理的解决是大大地可以决定作品的面貌的。作者用选择人物来答复那种他对什么人加以重要注意，他将要竭尽自己天才的全副力量来描写什么人的问题；描写一个把我们社会中的一切新的东西，先进的东西集中到一身的人，或者描写一个紧拉住落后的，陈旧的，正在逝去的东西不放手的人。
    从对这个问题的回答上我们可以知道作者对现实生活的态度，他是如何——正确地还是不正确地——了解它，他是否正确地看到现实生活的进步趋向，对于他来说，这些趋向是否为我们生活中的最重要的，最宝贵的，他是否就是企图把自己的天才的全副力量，把自己心脏的全副热情贡献给这种最宝贵的东西。
    如果举卡塔耶夫的长篇小说《拥护苏维埃政权》为例子来说，问问自己，在小说中什么人应当成为新的，先进的事物的中心呢，什么人应当成为对胜利的信心，党的坚定性，党的不妥协性，以及布尔什维克热情的中心呢，那末简直可以很清楚地看到，领导留在坟窟中的人们活动的地下区委会书记——加甫里克·柴尔诺伊万年科——应当是这样的人物。然而他在卡塔耶夫的小说里面是否成为这样的人了呢？对于这个问题的回答是否定的。
    卡塔耶夫的失败是因为作者没有注意到由他所描写的现实生活中的最主要的，最先进的东西。这个基本的错误把自己的暗影投到了整个小说上面。有许多人物本身是很生动的和正确的，如果作者能首先正确地描写了那个把小说中的落后人物领导起来的人，那末这些人物也可表现成另外的，无比积极的生活。
    对于社会主义现实主义的方法如此欠缺，对于生活研究的表面化导致一位著名的苏维埃作家在其作品中产生本质上的错误。
    对批评采取了蔑视态度和对苏维埃人生活的异常不熟悉导致另外一位著名的苏维埃作家潘菲约洛夫，在其不久以前所发表的长篇小说《伟大的艺术》中犯了类似的错误。
    在这一部作为他的以前两部长篇小说——《为和平而斗争》及《在被征服者的国家内》——的续篇的小说中，作者的目标是想表现大乌拉尔汽车工厂的工作，表现工厂的斯塔汉诺夫工人，表现其党的组织和描绘出工厂的老英雄们——尼古莱·珂拉布廖夫和塔琪扬娜·波罗甫采娃——的未来命运。
    在小说里面针对着积极的形象尼古莱·珂拉布廖夫——一个很好的共产党员，照作者的设想，是一个先进的事业家——设定了一个邪恶的人物——厂长柯柯列夫。这个人物在读者面前一出现就是一个利禄薰心和野心勃勃的人，具有野蛮的工作作风，对工人态度很坏。后来发现，柯柯列夫——只是一个破坏分子，是美国的特务。在揭穿了柯柯列夫—尼尔逊以后，珂拉布廖夫又成了工厂厂长，而且他很迅速地把工厂工作恢复好了。事件的一般构思是可以这样看法的。
    遗憾得很，潘菲约洛夫描写一个拥有大量工人数目，拥有巨大的党组织的苏维埃大工厂的工作，在本质上这一切都只是充任背景，先是仇敌的，破坏的力量——柯柯列夫——尼尔逊在这个背景上活动，后来就是——积极的，创造的力量——尼古莱·阿拉布廖夫在上面活动。
    一个钻到苏维埃工厂厂长地位的顽固的破坏者和特务，一定会带来不少损害。然而恐怕在我们的苏维埃现实生活中不会允许柯柯列夫能利用如此粗暴的，暴露自己的方式，即使是短时期把强有力的党组织踏到自己脚底下，欺骗大批的工人也不可能。
    潘菲约洛夫由于欠缺社会主义现实主义的方法，降低了苏维埃工人阶级的觉悟程度，降低了党组织的作用和意义，更不用谈苏维埃人用来和破坏苏维埃制度进行斗争的那些方法，他简直描写得不正确了。
    作者企图描写出一个破坏者和特务分子柯柯列夫的特别清楚的形象，的确在小说的许多篇页上创造了令人不能忘掉的坏蛋形象。然而他用行动把柯柯列夫夸张到成一个公开为恶，公开反对苏维埃分子的程度，夸张到其恶劣行为入眼即可了解的程度，然而竟在小说中拖长了很多篇幅迫使许多优秀的（照作者的臆造）和聪明的苏维埃人在这种现实生活意义中迷了方向，作者这样粗笨地歪曲了生活的真相，歪曲了这些人物的形象，并降低了他们。如果柯柯列夫确如他在小说中行动那种样子活动，这样公开地反苏维埃，那末他周围的人们——如党的中央委员会的组织家卢肯，总工程师阿里特曼及许多工厂工人——不会不立刻看出这位厂长本身是个什么东西的。
    潘菲约洛夫违反生活的真相，为了适应廉价的趣味，如此突出和夸张了柯柯列夫这个邪恶人物，和这同时就把忠实的苏维埃人们的形象弄得贫乏了。
    潘菲约洛夫在基本的积极人物——尼古莱·珂拉布廖夫——身上也有很多失败地方。作者是想把珂拉布廖夫臆造为一个非凡的和优秀的人的。但是潘菲约洛夫选择了一种很可非议的方法来描写珂拉布廖夫，就是用不断地强调他的功业，用无限夸张他的积极性的方法。
    像珂拉布廖夫这样先进人物在我们的生活中是存在着的。他们用千万条线和现实生活紧密联系着，不脱离生活，他们的力量恰巧就在这上面。潘菲约洛夫的珂拉布廖夫被抬到现实生活以上去了，而小说中所描写的这种现实生活的本身也大部分是人工制造的，这是因为作者需要这个，以便于主角——尼古莱·珂拉布廖夫——的命运可以这样或那样地转变。
    例如，在战争的末尾住在德国法西斯匪徒的集中营里的珂拉布廖夫一被释放，刚刚和苏联的司令部一联络上，许多元帅，司令官，将军们就互相打电话传遍整个德国境内：“珂拉布廖夫找到啦”。这还不算。作者描绘珂拉布廖夫的返回苏联，实在有些太过分，他写道：“关于尼古莱·珂拉布廖夫来到的消息像鸟一样飞到莫斯科，飞到列宁格勒，斯大林格勒，乌兹别吉斯坦，卡萨赫斯坦，伏尔加河沿岸………”
    珂拉布廖夫回到工厂以后不几天的工夫又成了工厂的厂长，而且在很短时期内建设了制度。这一切都是发生得出奇的快的。作者人工地把自己的主角脚底下的障碍都给扫除掉，而这些障碍实际上是需要人在生活中才能克服的。
    结果造成了这样的印象，珂拉布廖夫——是一个超人，一切东西他都很容易掌握，《飞行地毯》和《能变出食物的桌布》（都是《天方夜谈》里的故事——译者注）都给他预备好了。造成一种印象，仿佛自被柯柯列夫所造成的那种可怕情况中把工厂再建起来的并非由于工厂集体的努力，而只是由于珂拉布廖夫个人努力的结果。
    然而都知道，完美无缺的人是没有的。在这样巨大的，像推动整个工厂前进的事业中，党组织所领导的强大的集体起着主要作用。而且为了表现领导者的功绩和巨大的才能，根本不需要过分强调这个人的功绩和才能虚构得举世无双。
    小说中珂拉布廖夫掌握工厂新轮廓的插曲是很有特征的。起初珂拉布廖夫坐着，钻在英文书和德文书堆中，从这些书中并没有得到新的真理，因为在资本主义生产的体系中，全部技术进程都是建筑在脱离工人们——事实上在生产机器的人们——的利益上，因此对于“这于我们没有用处”的结论也不是什么新的结论。珂拉布廖夫为了要证明这个已为任何一个苏维埃人所熟知的道理，从莫斯科汽车工厂订购了很多材料，一面研究它们，一面呼叫：“这才是——我们所需要的东西！”
    以后，珂拉布廖夫就决定去研究这个工厂的工作，飞到莫斯科去。他拜访厂长，和他一同去参观传送装置，在那里逗留了几小时，就在当日又飞回来了。这样“掌握经验”的方法，和在我国所实际发生的，真正严肃地研究先进工厂经验的方法有什么共同之点呢？
