    Free Lending of New Comic Books
    Will Help Old Comic Book Stalls Exchange for New Books
    [Our Newspaper] News: Old comic books, which specialize in spreading feudal superstitions, have gradually been abandoned by the people of Beijing. In the Tianqiao area of Beijing, there are many old comic book stalls, and the working people and stall vendors in the area mostly use them as pastimes. In order to meet the needs of the working people for new knowledge, the Fourth Cultural Center of Beijing City recently bought some new comic books with new content, plus popular books and picture albums. From April 5th, cadres of the center and local activists set up comic book stalls in the area, without charging rent, which was greatly welcomed by the working people and out-of-school children in the area. For two days, the audience has been crowded in front of the book stalls all day long. The books are not enough to be distributed, and before A has finished reading, B has already reserved them. Stall vendors and apprentices from nearby stalls and shops sent representatives to borrow them collectively; they return them and exchange them after four hours. On April 4th, some books were lost. On the 5th, the masses automatically helped with management, and the order was greatly improved. An apprentice said: "Old comic books are meaningless, they are all about gods and ghosts; new comic books have current affairs and stories of the People's Liberation Army, which make people understand the truth." A pedicab worker said: "I didn't have the time or money to look at them before, but now the people's government is taking care of us." In the past two days, the business of old comic book stalls in the Tianqiao area has become deserted. Ma Wenguang, the leader of the old comic book stall vendors, has contacted the center and requested the center to help exchange the old comic books. The center will soon convene the old comic book stall vendors in the area to discuss this matter.

　　天桥第四文化馆
    免费借阅新小人书
    将帮助旧小人书摊换新书
    【本报讯】专以散播封建迷信为能事的旧小人书，已逐渐为京市人民所摒弃。北京天桥一带，旧小人书摊甚多，该地劳动人民及摊贩多以此为消遣品。京市第四文化馆为了满足劳动人民对新知识的需要，最近买了些新内容的小人书，加上通俗的书籍和画报，由该馆干部和地方积极分子，从四月五日起，前往该地区摆设小人书摊，不收租钱，受到了该地区劳动人民及失学儿童们的极大欢迎。两日来观众终日拥挤在书摊前。书籍不敷分配，甲还没看完，乙就订下了。附近的摊贩和商店的学徒们，推出代表集体前来借阅；四个钟头归还又换。四月四日书籍曾有遗失，五日，群众自动帮忙管理，秩序大为改进。一个小学徒说：旧小人书没意思，尽是闹神闹鬼的；新小人书有时事、有解放军的故事，叫人明白道理。三轮工人说：以前没工夫、没钱，瞧不上，现在人民政府可照顾我们。两日来，天桥一带的旧小人书摊生意已显得冷落。旧小人书摊贩组长马文光已向该馆联系，请求该馆帮助换去旧小人书。该馆日内即将召请该地区旧小人书摊贩，商讨此事。
