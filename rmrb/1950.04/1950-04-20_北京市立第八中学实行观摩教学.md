Beijing No. 8 Middle School Implements Observation-Based Teaching

[This newspaper] The Municipal No. 8 Middle School in Beijing has been conducting observation-based teaching, and has achieved considerable results since it began in early March. The school previously had the following shortcomings in its teaching: 1. Some teachers worked very hard subjectively and prepared a lot of material for their lessons, but they did not clearly grasp the purpose and center of each lesson, making it difficult to achieve effective results. For example, when a teacher taught "The Illiterate Writer," he introduced the Book of Songs in many ways, but the students remembered very little. 2. When lecturing, some teachers used a lot of terminology and jargon, making it difficult for students to understand or become interested. 3. Some teachers were concerned with their image and often answered questions incorrectly when they themselves did not understand the questions raised by the students. In October of last year, the school's Chinese language teachers initiated a mutual class observation movement, but because most teachers were concerned in their minds at the time, thinking that observing classes was "picking faults," they were unwilling for others to listen to their lessons and avoided listening to others' lessons themselves. Even if they listened to others' lessons, they were reluctant to offer opinions due to "face." As a result, the class observation movement did not achieve any results. After winter vacation studies, the teachers began to realize the importance of this work. Therefore, at the beginning of this semester, the teaching and research section once again arranged observation-based teaching and actively helped the teachers establish regular research groups. Now, observation-based teaching has been launched and is playing a certain role in actual teaching.

　　北京市立第八中学实行观摩教学
    【本报讯】市立第八中学举办国文观摩教学，从三月上旬开始至今已获得不少成绩。该校原来在教学中曾有如下缺点：一、有的教师主观上很努力，教课时准备的材料很多，但没有明确掌握每课的目的和中心，以致不易收到效果。如某先生在教“不识字的作家”时，多方介绍了诗经，同学们记住的却很少。二、讲书时有的教师满口术语、名词，使同学听不懂或不感兴趣。三、有的教师爱面子，常把同学们提出的自己也不明白的问题解答错了。去年十月间，该校国文教师即曾发起互相听课运动，但因当时多数教师在思想上存有顾虑，认为听课是“挑毛病”，不愿别人听自己的课，自己也避讳去听别人的课，即或听了别人的课也碍于“面子”，不提意见。因而听课运动没有收到什么效果。经过寒假学习，教师们开始认识到这个工作的重要性，因此，教导处在这学期开学之初再度布置观摩教学，并主动地帮助教师们建立了定期的研究会。现在观摩教学已开展起来，并在实际教学中起着一定的作用。
