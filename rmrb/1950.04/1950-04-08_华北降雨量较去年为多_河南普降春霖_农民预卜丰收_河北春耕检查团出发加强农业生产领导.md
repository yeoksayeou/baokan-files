　　North China Rainfall Higher Than Last Year
    Henan Experiences Widespread Spring Rain·Farmers Predict a Bountiful Harvest
    Hebei Sends Spring Cultivation Inspection Team to Strengthen Agricultural Production Leadership
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the North China Meteorological Observatory, the rainfall in North China in January and February of this year was generally higher than last year, which greatly benefits this year's spring cultivation. In Beijing, the rainfall in February last year was 5.5 mm, and in February this year it was 6.5 mm. In Tianjin, the rainfall in January last year was minimal, and in February it was 2.6 mm; this year, the rainfall in January was 2 mm, and in February it was 4.4 mm. In Shijiazhuang, the rainfall in January this year was 2.6 mm, in February it was 5.9 mm, and in March it reached 7.1 mm. In Zhangjiakou, the rainfall in January this year was 4.9 mm, and in February it was 5.5 mm; in Taiyuan and other places, the rainfall in February this year was 8.2 mm, and in March it was 2.1 mm; in Baotou, the rainfall in January this year was 3 mm, and in February it was 4.3 mm. North China was able to complete spring planting well last year despite low rainfall. With this year’s higher rainfall, plus sufficient moisture in the ground in some areas due to last autumn’s floods, it is estimated that this year’s spring cultivation in North China will be completed even better.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 6th] Spring rains have fallen widely in Henan, and the peasant masses are predicting a bumper harvest and are greatly encouraged. Since the beginning of spring, Henan has had three rains, the last one being before the Qingming Festival. The continuous spring drizzle lasted for several days, soaking the ground more than four inches deep, which is of great benefit to this year’s agricultural harvest. According to experienced farmers, if wheat does not suffer unexpected disasters this year, a bumper harvest can be expected. At the same time, these rains are also very beneficial for planting sorghum and ensuring the harvest of other autumn crops. In the eastern Henan area, more than 2.3 million newly planted willow trees have also sprouted and leafed out completely after the rain. Because the spring rains are timely and adequate, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased a hundredfold. They say: "This year we have been allocated land, and we also have good rain, plus hard work, so we look forward to a good life."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th] The Hebei Provincial Spring Cultivation Inspection Team departed on the 6th to work in various regions of the province. The inspection team is led by Comrade Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Jiguang, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, and Jiang Zhanchun, Deputy Director, with the participation of more than 800 working cadres from provincial-level agencies. The main tasks of the team are to inspect the spring cultivation, harrowing, elimination of bare and uncultivated land, land reserved for cotton, protection of wheat, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, provision of water wheels for loans, well-digging, and the preparation of various seeds, so as to promptly discuss and solve problems with local leading cadres. At the same time, in order to learn from experience and improve working methods, the team will focus its inspection of spring cultivation work on the non-disaster-stricken Handan area and the disaster-stricken Tangshan area as two key areas. Furthermore, the Hebei Provincial Urban Work Inspection Team has also been formed and will depart for work soon. The team is composed of more than 50 experienced cadres from the provincial government, provincial party committee, supply and marketing cooperative, transportation bureau, and other agencies. Its main task is to inspect the implementation of the resolutions of the province’s urban economic conference and to understand the economic situation of various towns.

　　华北降雨量较去年为多
    河南普降春霖·农民预卜丰收
    河北春耕检查团出发加强农业生产领导
    【本报讯】据华北气象台报告：华北今年一、二月份降雨量普遍较去年为多，对今年春耕得益很大。北京市去年二月降雨五·五公厘，今年二月降雨六·五公厘。天津市去年一月降雨极少，二月降雨二·六公厘；今年一月降雨二公厘，二月降雨四·四公厘。石家庄今年一月降雨二·六公厘，二月五·九公厘，三月达七·一公厘。张家口市今年一月降雨四·九公厘，二月五·五公厘；太原市等地今年二月降雨八·二公厘，三月二·一公厘；包头今年一月降雨三公厘，二月四·三公厘。华北在去年降雨较少的情况下，尚能很好完成春耕播种，今年降雨量较去年为多，再加有些地区去秋大水，地里水分充足，估计今年华北春耕定能更好地完成。
    【新华社开封六日电】河南各地普降春雨，农民群众预卜丰收，欢欣鼓舞。入春以来，河南已落雨三次，最后一次是在清明节前，春风细雨连绵数日，透地四寸余，对今年农业收获，裨益甚大。据有经验之农民谈：今年小麦如不遭受意外灾害，即可丰收无虞。同时，这些雨水对耩种高粱和保证其他秋季作物的收成，亦十分有利。豫东地区新植柳树二百三十余万株，雨后也已全部吐芽放叶。由于春雨适时适量，农民生产情绪百倍高涨。他们说：“今年咱分了地，又有了好雨，再加上好好劳动，就望着好日子了。”
