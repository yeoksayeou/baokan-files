A Good Way to Improve Work by Connecting with the Masses
　　The Tenth Police Station in the Three Inner Districts of Beijing
　　Holds a Police-People Joint Celebration to Listen to Public Criticism and Suggestions
　　[Our Newspaper] The Tenth Police Station in the Three Inner Districts of Beijing held a police-people joint celebration on the evening of the 22nd to solicit criticism and suggestions from residents regarding the work of the police station. This is a good way to closely connect with the masses and mobilize the masses to supervise the work of the police station. The celebration was held at the Central Primary School in the Three Districts, with approximately one thousand residents from all walks of life attending. Zhang Enbo, the head of the police station, first reported on the various tasks carried out since the merger of the street government and the police station, and sincerely requested the masses to offer criticisms and suggestions regarding the work of the police station. The participating masses, with the spirit of cherishing their own government and improving its work, eagerly spoke up, competing to offer their opinions. Doctor Yang Yinong suggested: The sewers on Jiaonan Street are blocked, and there is water accumulation when it rains, making it extremely inconvenient to walk; a sewage pool should be built in Jixiang Hutong; the flour sold by the cooperative should be covered well, otherwise it is detrimental to hygiene. Vendor Bai Feng criticized the anti-air raid work as not being thorough enough. He said: This is mainly because the publicity work is not done well enough. He suggested that police officers and citizens jointly form a supervisory team. Bai Feng suggested finding a doctor to give everyone some health knowledge and conduct regular health check-ups. He believes that the relationship between the police and the people is still not close enough, "some police officers are afraid of the people, and some people are afraid of the police," which hinders mutual contact. In the future, this barrier should be eliminated to truly achieve a close relationship between the police and the people. Finally, Bai Feng said with concern: A wire in Majiangjun Hutong has lost its rubber coating. He hopes that the police officers patrolling at night will pay attention to avoid accidents. Citizen Liu Hanmin suggested: Police officers checking household registrations should wear a symbol, which would be convenient for conducting work. The attendees strictly criticized individual police officers who still retained old work styles. Barber Zhu Dianqi said: Police officer Qi Fushan's attitude was not good when he inspected air defense equipment. An old lady surnamed Zhang asked, "If there is no anti-air raid cover, is it okay to cover it with a black cloth?" Qi Fushan ridiculed, "Yes! I'll even give you two bags of flour!" Student Li Pei said: Many police officers are not responsible enough and chat idly while patrolling.
　　In order to prevent theft, the district recently informed citizens that they should strictly close their doors. Female Alley Leader Lei Guiying criticized police officer Chen Baorui at the meeting. Lei said: One night, my family did not bolt the door properly, and police officer Chen Baorui sternly criticized us, saying: You are the alley leader and you don't pay attention, how can you lead others? His attitude was very bad. Woman Qi Sujun believes: Although the attitude is not good, the starting point is not bad. She added: Some people think that the police station's inspection of air raid preparations is too troublesome time and time again, but isn't it all for our benefit? Student Man Deming criticized the head of the station at the meeting for not paying attention to people, hoping that he could better connect with the masses in the future. Someone pointed out: Police officers should not play with guns and pull the bolts casually while patrolling, because that is easy to cause accidental firing. Worker Bao Zhigang compared the police in the past with the police now. He said that the old police specialized in harassing the people; while the people's police now protect the interests of the people.
　　The meeting was unanimously praised by the attendees, and they "hoped that such meetings would be held more often in the future." Someone also said: I didn't offer any suggestions this time, but I must prepare next time.
　　After the meeting, police officer Qi Fushan said: "I used to think I was very progressive! But I made these mistakes. Why don't other people make mistakes? I promise that I will never show a bad attitude to the people again in the future." Wu Dexiang said: "The masses' awareness has improved, and we should work harder to learn!" Some police officers also said, "Although the masses didn't criticize me this time, I feel that I still have many shortcomings, and I should actively overcome them in the future and wholeheartedly do more work for the people."

　　联系群众改进工作的良好形式
    京内三区第十派出所
    举行警民联欢大会听取群众批评建议
    【本报讯】京市内三区第十派出所于二十二日晚召开警民联欢大会，征求居民对派出所工作的批评与建议。这是一种密切联系群众，发动群众监督派出所工作的良好形式。联欢会假三区中心小学举行，到各界居民约一千人。派出所长张恩伯首先报告了街政府、派出所合并后所进行的各项工作，并诚恳地要求群众对派出所的工作提出批评与建议。与会群众一本爱护自己政府及改进工作的精神，争先恐后，热烈发言。医生杨艺农提议：交南大街下水道堵塞，下雨积水，行路极不方便，应该修整；吉祥胡同应筑一秽水池；合作社出售的面粉应盖好，否则有碍卫生。小贩白峰批评防空工作不够彻底，他说：这主要是宣传工作做的不够。他建议由警士和市民共同组成督导小组。白峰提议找医生给大家讲些卫生常识，和作定期的卫生检查。他认为目前在警民关系上仍不够密切，“有的警察怕老百姓，也有的老百姓怕警察”，这样就阻碍彼此的联系。今后应当排除这种隔膜，真正做到警民一家。最后白峰关心地说：马将军胡同有一根电线没了胶皮，希望夜间巡逻的警士同志们注意，以免遭受意外之灾。市民刘汉民建议：查户口的警士应当佩带一种符号，这对进行工作有方便。到会群众对个别尚存有旧作风的警士进行了严格的批评。理发工人朱殿启说：警士戚福山检查防空设备时，态度不够好。有一位张老太太问：“没有防空罩用黑布朦上可以不？”戚福山却讥讽地说：“可以！还给你两袋面哩！”学生李沛说：有许多警士巡逻时不够负责闲聊天。
    该区为了防盗，不久之前曾告知市民应严闭门户。女闾长雷桂英在会上对警士陈宝瑞提出批评。雷说：有一天晚上我家没把门栓好，警士陈宝瑞厉声指责我们说：你们当闾长都不注意，怎么领导人家？态度很不好。妇女齐素君认为：态度虽不好，但出发点并不坏。她又说：有人认为派出所检查防空准备工作一次又一次的太麻烦，其实还不都是为了我们？学生满德明在会上批评所长不爱理人，希望今后能更好地联系群众。有人提出：警士在巡逻时不应该随便玩枪拉大栓。因为那样容易走火，工人包志刚把过去和现在的警察做了个对比。他说，旧警察是专门骚扰老百姓的；而现在人民的警察是保护人民利益的。
    这个会议获得与会者的一致好评，并且“希望这样的会以后应多开”。还有人说：这回没提出意见，下回一定要准备准备。
    会后，警士戚福山说：“我以前还觉得自己很进步哩！可是犯了这些错误。人家为什么不犯错呢，我今后保证不再向人民耍态度了。”吴德祥说：“现在群众觉悟都提高了，我们应该加油学习！”也有的警士说，“这次群众虽然没批评我，我觉得自己还有很多缺点，今后应积极克服，忠心地为人民多作些工作。”
