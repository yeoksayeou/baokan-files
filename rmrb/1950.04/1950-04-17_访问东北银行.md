　　Visiting the Northeast Bank
　　By Our Special Correspondent, Tian Liu

　　On a sunny morning, I visited the Northeast Bank. The Northeast Bank is located in the old site of the Puppet Manchukuo Central Bank, an old three-story building. It was in this old, even somewhat dilapidated building, that new things happened that were related to the lives of the 40 million working people of Northeast China.

　　"Since the beginning of this year, the Northeast Bank has not issued a single currency note," Manager Wang told me. "Currently, the deposits absorbed by the bank are equivalent to 130% of the total amount issued, and the credit loans to the national economy are equal to the total amount issued. ..." We also talked about many things, which do not need to be recorded here one by one. Just these few simple words are enough to explain everything.

　　This event occurred in the first quarter of 1950, which is even more precious. People all know that the first quarter is usually the most difficult quarter for national finances - the income that should be received has not yet been received, and the expenditures that must be made must be spent. Otherwise, it will affect the progress of the entire national cause and the realization of the annual plan for the recovery and reconstruction of the national economy. This year's economic construction plan for the Northeast region is unprecedentedly huge. Taking the industrial construction plan as an example, this year's total output value will be equivalent to 193% of last year's, an increase of nearly double. In order to successfully realize this huge plan, more than 200,000 workers will be added, and many machines, equipment, and buildings will be added, and other undertakings that are compatible with it will be established. All of this requires a large amount of funds. The Northeast Bank has victoriously shouldered its task, releasing loans equal to the amount issued during this period to meet the huge needs of this unprecedented economic recovery, without issuing a single banknote. This is the first time in the history of the Northeast Bank, and it is also unprecedented in the history of the People's Bank of China. The period of relying on issuing currency to support the people's revolutionary war and solve the country's financial difficulties has begun to come to an end.

　　How did all this happen? Four days later, I attended the Seventh Branch Manager Conference of the Northeast Bank and found all the answers. This conference was specifically convened to summarize the work since the Northeast Bank implemented the new business policy in the first quarter of 1950.

　　Starting this year, the Northeast Bank has completely changed its business policy: from the past method of financial allocation and supply to various agencies and state-owned enterprises, it has shifted to a credit system for banks, established new settlement relationships with various agencies and state-owned enterprises, and implemented comprehensive cash management. This has enabled the bank's work to move from the past situation of being just a simple receipt and payment treasury or cashier's office under the national financial department, and begin to assume the bank's true responsibilities, begin to become the country's general accounting agency, and move towards the bank's ideal goal: "a reservoir and regulator of national economic resources." The establishment and gradual implementation of this new policy, although only for a short period of three months, has made the Northeast Bank's appearance焕然一新 (completely new) and has achieved many good results.

　　The Northeast Bank started its new business policy in this way: First, it established settlement relationships with major state-owned enterprises such as various bureaus and mines of the Ministry of Industry, various companies of the Ministry of Commerce, railways, and postal and telecommunications. The bank helped with the settlement of accounts and the payment of short-term working capital and necessary cash. All transactions between enterprises are no longer carried out in cash or by mutual credit and borrowing, etc., but are settled at the bank. The bank uses its accounting agency characteristics to carry out non-cash transfers, deducting the payment from the buyer's deposit and transferring it to the seller's account. If the buyer's deposit is insufficient, a short-term turnover will be granted according to the bank's credit policy and regulations. This greatly saves cash payments. Taking the Ministry of Industry as an example: In the first quarter, it should have withdrawn 100 in cash from the bank, but due to temporary needs, it had to withdraw 143 to solve the problem. In order to support production, the bank allocated it in full. On the surface, it seems that the bank has provided 43% more working capital for the Ministry of Industry. In fact, this is not the case. Because the units under the Ministry of Industry have settlement relationships with the bank, and some units have more than 80% of their deposits in the bank, the result of the settlement is that after mutual offsetting, the bank actually only took out 63% of the cash, which not only paid the Ministry of Industry's original plan of 100%, but also solved its additional need of 43%. One penny almost did the work of three pennies. This is the benefit brought about by the bank becoming a settlement center, especially the transactions between financial departments, which are settled at the bank immediately. Enterprise departments hand in profits, taxes, depreciation fees, etc. through the bank's deduction from their deposits and immediate deposit into the treasury, solving the long-standing problem of unclear debts between financial departments. Moreover, this new settlement system enables the bank to highly utilize deposits and ensure the support of those enterprises that should and need to be supported, so as to carry out smooth production. Because a set of funds can be used for two or even more sets of funds, the bank's cash inventory has increased. The Northeast Bank's cash inventory in March this year reached more than 241% of December last year. Although large-scale economic construction requires a large amount of funds, due to cash savings and increased inventory, and because a set of funds can be used for multiple sets of funds, there is no need to issue currency. Therefore, it is bound to create financial and price stability. In the first quarter of this year, the Northeast's prices only rose by 6.8% (of which, due to a large number of industrial repairs and the need for construction, building materials, hardware, and electrical materials rose by 18%. If calculated according to daily necessities, most of them fell), which is close to normal.

　　After the bank implemented the new policy, it vigorously promoted the implementation of economic accounting by enterprises. In the past, when money was needed, it was collected from the accounting bureau, and people often wanted to collect more. Now it is a credit relationship, and interest must be paid for borrowing money, so whoever borrows money has to consider it, borrowing as little as possible, and borrowing one day later if possible. When there is money, it is quickly sent to the bank in order to repay the loan or deposit it to earn interest. Manager Wang told me two things: Last year, the bank bought a batch of paper from the Andong Paper Mill, and the factory did not come to transfer the account within a year. This year, after the implementation of the settlement, the bank bought a batch of fertilizer from Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the factory came to transfer the account at that time. With the strengthening of economic accounting by various enterprises, bank deposits have increased unprecedentedly. In January last year, the deposits absorbed by the bank were only 25% of the amount issued. Although there was an increase by the end of the year, it only reached 58% of the amount issued. After the implementation of the new business policy, it reached 130% of the total amount issued by the end of March. The bank's strength is unprecedentedly abundant and powerful, and it can expand credit to support production. By the end of March, credit had doubled compared to the end of last year! This credit work is carried out on the basis of settlement. Because the bank has a better understanding of the production and capital turnover of various enterprises than before, the credit work has escaped from the quagmire of "bestowal," blindness, and "political solutions" in the past, and began to actively and systematically carry out credit in coordination with production. For example, in the past, the state's investment in Anshan Iron and Steel Company was allocated regularly in batches, but Anshan Iron and Steel could not use these funds all at once, so it had to deposit them in the bank. Because the bank did not know when Anshan Iron and Steel would use the money, it did not dare to use these deposits, fearing that if Anshan Iron and Steel wanted to use it, it would not be able to raise the funds in time and delay production, so it had to let a large amount of funds be frozen in the bank's treasury for a long time. In January this year, after the bank changed its business policy, it established a settlement relationship with Anshan Iron and Steel, grasped its production plan and income and expenditure plan, and knew when it would use money and when it would deposit money. The bank was then able to actively allocate the funds in the treasury and use them for urgent production and construction. The municipal kiln company obtained a loan under this circumstance and restored 20 kiln bodies to expand production. Other difficulties such as the shortage of funds for forestry, local products, grain purchase, commodity promotion, and many enterprises in the production process were all solved by expanding credit and actively implementing credit in a planned manner. This powerfully coordinated production.

　　The cash management work in the Northeast region was implemented as early as April last year. Although it has achieved many results, it is still an economic system of supply nature because it is not combined with credit, settlement, etc., and various enterprises have not established an independent accounting system. In order to thoroughly manage cash, it is only required that various agencies and enterprises deposit money in the bank. However, because there is no cash plan, depositors can deposit or withdraw as they wish. As for whether the amount deposited meets the standard, and whether the money is used properly after it is spent, the bank cannot judge and control it. This year, after the bank established settlement relationships with various enterprises, it grasped the production plan and financial income and expenditure plan of various enterprises, which made cash management more thorough. When various enterprises come to the bank to withdraw money, the bank checks its purpose according to its production plan and transfers the money to it, so that the cash is not taken away, or not taken away completely. This is the only way to truly achieve the purpose of cash management and saving cash. For example, if an enterprise does not deposit money in the bank, the bank can check the reasons according to its financial plan and urge it to implement it. In addition to promoting cash management in conjunction with credit and settlement, the bank also sent a large number of cadres to conduct cash inspections of many enterprises in conjunction with the competent departments, stipulating the cash inventory of each unit, and establishing a mobile collection team to collect money from various enterprises. This method is very good. It not only promotes the timely return of currency and accelerates the turnover of funds, but also solves the difficulties of various enterprises in depositing money and reduces the cost of transporting cash. In the past, the Anshan Grain Company's payment for goods could only be sent to the bank in three days. Now it can be deposited into the treasury in one day. After Harbin improved its cash management methods, it increased its cash by more than 20 billion yuan every day. Through the mobile collection team, the bank can understand the cash income and expenditure of the enterprise on the same day, which further strengthens the cash management work. In addition, banks in Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin and other industrial areas have established offices or set up resident staff in enterprises, extended or changed working hours in order to provide various conveniences for enterprises to pay money. The office established by Anshan Bank in Anshan Iron and Steel Company has become its general cashier and general accountant. Not only are all payments collected and paid by the bank on its behalf, but even wages are paid by the bank on its behalf. Two people at Andong Bank took two hours to replace the work of ten people at the Andong Paper Mill, who took one or two days to pay wages to the workers, which won the support of the enterprise, and cash management and other businesses were also launched. Now the cash management work in the Northeast region is no longer simply letting various units deposit money in the bank, but is further starting to check and control whether the cash of various departments is used properly. The bank has begun to assume the task of the national treasury, collecting and paying various funds and issuing public bonds on behalf of the national financial authorities. Now, various industrial and commercial taxes, water and electricity bills in cities, as well as postal and telecommunications fees and public bond funds in the Northeast are all handled by the Northeast Bank.

　　The Northeast Bank has begun to become the settlement, credit and cash management center of state-owned enterprises, and has begun to assume the task of a reservoir and regulator of national economic resources. Although this is only the beginning, there are still many shortcomings in the bank's own work that need to be improved, and there are still many difficulties to be overcome on the road ahead. However, as long as we continue to earnestly implement this correct policy, its achievements will improve day by day, and all kinds of difficulties can be overcome.

　　访问东北银行
    本报特派记者  田流
    在一个阳光绚烂的早晨，我去访问东北银行。东北银行在伪满中央银行的旧址，是座古老的三层楼房。就在这座古老的甚至有点破旧的楼房里，发生了关系东北四千万劳动人民生活的新事情。
    “今年以来，东北银行没有发行一张货币”王经理告诉我：“现在银行吸收的存款已相当于总发行额百分之一百三十，对国民经济的信用贷款已和总发行额相等。……”我们还谈了许多，用不着都把它一一记在这里，仅仅这几句简单的话，就足够说明一切了。
    这件事发生在一九五○年的第一季度里，是更加值得珍贵的。人们都晓得，第一季度通常是国家财政最困难的季度——应该收入的还没有收入，应该支出的又必须支出。不然，便会影响整个国家事业的进行，就会影响全年国民经济的恢复与重建计划的实现。今年东北区的经济建设计划又是空前巨大的。以工业建设计划为例，今年生产总值要相当去年的百分之一百九十三，提高将及一倍。为了胜利地实现这一巨大计划，将要增添二十万以上的工人，将要添设许多机器、设备、建筑，并兴办和它相适应的其他事业。而这一切都是需要大量资金的。东北银行胜利的担负起自己的任务，在这一时期放出了和发行额相等的贷款，以满足这空前规模的经济恢复的巨大需要，而且没有发行一张钞票。这在东北银行的历史上还是初见，就是在全国人民银行的历史上也是空前的。依靠发行货币来支持人民革命战争、解决国家财政困难的时期，已经开始终结了。
    这一切是怎样发生的呢？在四天后，我参加了东北银行第七届分支行经理会议，找到了全部的答案。这次会议是专门为了总结一九五○年第一季度银行实行新业务方针以来的工作而召开的。
    今年开始，东北银行彻底地改变了自己的业务方针：由过去对各机关和公营企业的财政拨付供给性质的办法，转变到向银行进行信贷制度，同各机关、公营企业建立起新的结算关系，并实行全面的现金管理。这就使银行工作，从过去那种只是国家财经部门下面的一个简单的收支金库或出纳机构的境地中走出来，开始负起银行的真正职责，开始成为国家的总会计机关，并向着银行的理想目标：“国家经济资财的贮水池、调节所”前进。这个新方针的树立和逐渐贯彻，虽然还只有简短的三个月时间，但已经使东北银行的面貌焕然一新，获得了许多很好的结果。
    东北银行是这样开始它的新业务方针的：首先同工业部各局矿、商业部各公司、铁路、邮电等各大国营企业建立起结算关系，银行帮助进行账目的结算及支付短期资金周转和必要的现金等工作。各企业之间的一切买卖往来，双方都不再以现金或互相赊欠、借贷等方式进行，都到银行来结算，银行利用其会计机关的特性进行非现金的转账，从买方的存款中把货款如数扣除，转存在卖方的账内，如果买方存款不足，则根据银行的信贷政策与章程给予短期的周转。这就大大地节省了现金支付。以工业部为例：第一季度它应在银行支取现金为一○○的话，后因发生临时需要，必须支取一四三才能解决问题，银行为扶助生产，即如数拨给了它。表面看来，好像银行多替工业部周转资金百分之四三。其实并不如此。因为工业部所属各单位同银行有结算关系，里面有些单位还在银行存款百分之八○以上，进行结算的结果，相互抵消后，实际上银行只拿出了百分之六三的现金，便不但付足了工业部原计划百分之百，还解决了它额外需要百分之四三的困难，一个钱几乎作了三个钱的事。这就是银行成为结算中心所带来的好处，尤其是财经部门之间双方往来，即时到银行结算，企业部门上缴利润、税收、折旧费等均经银行在其存款中扣解即时入库，解决了历来财经部门相互间债权债务纠缠不清的问题。而且这种新的结算制度，使银行有可能高度利用存款，保证扶助那些应该和需要扶助的企业，进行顺利的生产。因为一套资金可以抵两套以至多套资金运用，银行的现金库存就增加了。东北银行今年三月库存现金已达去年十二月份百分之二四一以上。虽然大规模的经济建设需要大量的资金，由于现金节省库存增加，由于一套资金能当多套资金运用，也就用不着发行货币了。因此也就必然造成金融和物价的稳定。今年第一季度东北物价仅上升百分之六·八（其中由于大量工业修复，需要修建，建筑器材，五金电料上涨百分之十八，如按生活必需品计算，则大部下跌），已接近正常状态。
    银行实行新方针后，有力地促进了企业实行经济核算。过去用钱时就到会计局去领，常常想多领一些。现在是信贷关系，借钱要出利息，所以谁借钱也要考虑考虑，能少借就少借，能晚借一天就晚借一天，有了钱便赶紧送到银行里，以便还清借款或存起来得利息。王经理告诉我两件事情：去年银行买了安东造纸厂一批纸，一年内该厂也不来转账。今年实行结算后，银行买了鞍山钢铁公司一部肥田粉，该厂当时就来转账了。随着各企业经济核算的加强，银行存款空前的增加了。去年一月银行吸收的存款仅当发行额的百分之二十五，到年底虽有增加，也仅达发行额的百分之五十八。实行新的业务方针后，到三月底已达总发行额百分之一百三○，银行力量空前充裕强大，更可扩大信贷扶助生产了。至三月底信贷已比去年底增加了一倍！这个信贷工作是在结算的基础上进行的。由于银行对各企业的生产、资金流转情况较前了解，信贷工作便从过去的“恩赐”、盲目、“政治解决”的泥潭中脱出，开始主动的、有计划的进行信贷配合生产。如过去国家对鞍山钢铁公司的投资是定期整批拨付的，但这些钱鞍钢并不能一下子用出，只好存在银行里，银行因不知鞍钢何时用钱，对这些存款也不敢运用，生怕鞍钢一旦要用，筹措不及耽误生产，只得让大量的资金长期的冻结在银行的金库里。今年一月银行改变业务方针后，同鞍钢建立了结算关系，掌握了它的生产计划和收支计划，知道它何时用钱何时存款，银行便有可能主动支配金库里的资金，运用到急需的生产和建设中去，市营窑业公司就是在这种情形下获得贷款，恢复了二十个窑身扩大生产的。其他如林业，土产、粮食购买，商品推销及不少企业在生产过程中资金不足的困难，都是在扩大信贷，有计划地主动地实行信贷下解决了。这就有力地配合了生产。
    东北地区的现金管理工作，远在去年四月后就实行了，虽也收到了不少成绩，但因为没有和信贷、结算等结合，各企业又没有建立独立会计制度，实质上仍是供给性质的经济制度。为了把现金管理得彻底，只是要求各机关、企业把钱存在银行来。但因为没有现金计划，存款户愿存就存，愿取就取，至于存的数目是否达到标准，将钱支出后用的是否得当，银行也无法判断掌握。今年银行同各企业建立结算关系后，掌握了各企业的生产计划和财务收支计划，才使现金管理更趋彻底。各企业来银行支款时，银行便根据其生产计划检查其用途并给它转账，使现金不拿走，或不全部拿走。这样才真正达到现金管理与节省现金的目的。如某企业没有到银行存款，银行便可根据其财务计划检查其原因，督促其实现。除了结合信贷、结算推行现金管理外，银行并派出大批干部，协同主管部门，对许多企业进行了现金检查，规定了各单位的现金库存额，并建立起流动收款组，分赴各企业收款。这方法很好。不仅促进了货币及时回笼，加速了资金流转；并解决了各企业交存的困难，减少了运送现款的费用。过去鞍山粮食公司的货款，三天才能送到银行，现在一天就能入库了，哈尔滨改进现金管理方法后，每天增加了二百余亿元的现金。银行工作通过流动收款组，当日就可了解企业现金收支情形，更加加强了现金管理工作。除此而外，沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨及其他工业区的银行，为着给企业交款以种种方便，已在企业内建立了办事处或设置了驻在员，延长或改变了工作时间。鞍山银行在鞍山钢铁公司设立的办事处，已成了它的总出纳，总会计，不仅一切款项都由银行代收代付，连工资也由银行代发了。安东银行两个人两小时便代替了安东造纸厂十来个人一两天才能把工资发到工人手里的工作，取得了企业的拥护，现金管理工作以及其他业务也开展起来了。现在东北地区的现金管理工作，已经不是单纯的让各单位把钱存到银行里，而是进一步开始检查和掌握各部门现金是否运用得当。银行已经开始担负起国家金库任务，代替国家财政机关收支各种款项和发行公债了。现在东北的各种工、商业税收、城市中的水电费，以及邮电费和公债款等，都是由东北银行代理的。
    东北银行已经开始成为国家企业的结算、信贷和现金管理中心，开始担负起国家经济资财的贮水池与调节所的任务。虽然，这还仅仅是开始，银行本身工作中还有不少缺点需要改进，前进的路上还有许多困难需要征服，但是，只要按照这个正确的方针努力贯彻下去，其成绩会是与日俱进，各种困难都可克服的。
