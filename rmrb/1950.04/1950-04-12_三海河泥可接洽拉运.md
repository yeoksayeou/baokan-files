[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Mud from the Three Seas Rivers Available for Contacting and Transporting
    [News from the Beijing Municipal News Office] During the dredging of the Three Seas in Beijing, it is estimated that approximately 270,000 cubic meters of mud will be excavated. According to the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, this river mud is highly effective as fertilizer and has lasting effects. A single application is effective for two to three years. In addition to notifying the suburban district governments to organize farmers to transport the mud, the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau has also informed various government agencies, military units, schools, and collective production units that they may also contact them to arrange transportation. For those in the suburbs who are farther away, a portion of the transportation costs may be subsidized at the discretion of the authorities. Contact locations for transportation arrangements: Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau or the Beihai Office of the First Construction Team (inside the Sangyuan Gate of Beihai Park).
