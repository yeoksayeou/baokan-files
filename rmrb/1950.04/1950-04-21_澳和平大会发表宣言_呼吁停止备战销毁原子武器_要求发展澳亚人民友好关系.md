Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, April 18th (TASS): The Australian Peace Congress held its first meeting on the 17th. Eight hundred representatives from all sectors of the country attended and discussed the draft declaration of the Australian Peace Committee submitted to the Congress by Committee Member Rogers. Representatives from labor unions, youth organizations, veteran youth organizations, church personnel, and other groups enthusiastically participated in the discussion of the draft declaration and warmly supported the points it raised.

The draft declaration pointed out that peace-loving people in Australia are closely watching the development of the arms race, the establishment of military alliances, and the propaganda about the inevitability of war. All of this is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter and the United Nations resolutions on this matter. Therefore, the draft declaration suggests that the Australian Peace Congress resolve to encourage the following actions by all possible means: (1) Stop the arms race, which is currently imposing unprecedented military expenditures on Australia and other countries; (2) Ensure the destruction of atomic bombs and similar weapons of mass destructive aggression through international agreements; (3) Guarantee and develop friendly relations between the Australian people and the Asian people. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, which is currently the only major power in the Pacific with which we have not yet established such relations; (4) Stop the current wars in Southeast Asia and oppose any Australian interference in these wars; (5) Oppose the rampant war preparations currently underway in Australia, especially the implementation of conscription; (6) Defend the rights of all Australians to freedom of speech, assembly, association, and working for peace; (7) Oppose all war propaganda, oppose inciting national or racial hatred, and conclude international peace treaties aimed at strengthening the United Nations in order to support the development of peaceful and friendly relations between countries.

The declaration emphasized that these goals can only be achieved through the most resolute and powerful actions of all peace-loving people. The draft declaration calls for the establishment of peace committees throughout Australia, in cities and villages, factories and mines, so that every Australian can have more opportunities to participate in the activities of striving for peace.

The Congress also elected its various committees on the 17th, including the Labor Union and Factory Representatives Committee, the Clergy and Church Personnel Committee, the Women and Youth Committee, and others.

    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社墨尔本十八日讯：澳大利亚和平大会十七日举行第一次会议，到全国各界代表八百人，讨论和平委员会委员罗吉斯提交大会的澳大利亚和平委员会宣言草案。工会、青年、退伍青年组织、教会人员等团体的代表，热烈参加了宣言草案的讨论，并热烈支持宣言草案提出的各点。
    宣言草案指出：澳大利亚爱好和平的人们，密切注意军备竞赛的发展、军事同盟的成立、和关于战争不可避免的宣传等等。所有这一切都与联合国宪章以及联合国关于这方面的决议的精神与条文相违背。因此，宣言草案建议澳洲和平大会决议用一切可能的方法鼓励以下的行动：（一）停止军备竞赛，这种竞赛目前已给澳大利亚及其他国家担负空前的军事开支；（二）用国际协议的方法保证销毁原子弹和类似的大规模毁灭性侵略武器；（三）保证而且发展澳大利亚人民与亚洲人民间的友好关系，为了达到这个目的，就需要与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，这是目前我们还未与之建立这种关系的太平洋上唯一的大国；（四）停止目前东南亚的战争，反对澳大利亚对这些战争作任何干涉；（五）反对在澳大利亚进行嚣张的战争准备，尤其是实施征兵；（六）保卫一切澳大利亚人均有言论、集会、结社及为和平而工作的权利；（七）反对一切战争宣传，反对煽动民族或种族的仇恨，缔结以加强联合国为目的的国际和平公约，以支持各国间和平友好关系的发展。
    宣言强调指出：这些目的只有靠所有爱好和平的人们最坚决最有力的行动，才能实现。宣言草案号召在澳大利亚全国各地，城市和乡村、工厂与矿场中成立保卫和平委员会，使每一个澳大利亚人能够得到更多的机会来参加争取和平的活动。
    大会十七日并选出了它的各个委员会，包括工会及工厂代表委员会，牧师教会人员委员会，妇女青年委员会等。
