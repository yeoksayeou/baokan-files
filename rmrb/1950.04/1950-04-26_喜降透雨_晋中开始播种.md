　　Welcome Rain Showers
    Jinzhong Begins Sowing
    [Report from our newspaper] After widespread rain showers in Jinzhong, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is high. They have completed all the preparatory work and are about to start sowing. In Pingyao, Jiexiu and other counties, the spring fields have been plowed and harrowed, and some have already used the sand-spreading method to sow melons and cotton. After the widespread rain on the 15th, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was even higher. They started soaking seeds, adding fodder to the livestock to prepare for sowing. The provincial and district agricultural extension teams have already gone to the countryside to assist in the work, and large-scale sowing is about to begin.

　　喜降透雨
    晋中开始播种
    【本报讯】晋中普降透雨后，农民生产情绪高涨，已作好一切准备工作，即将进行播种。平遥、介休等县的春地，经过翻耙，有的已用铺沙法播种了瓜类、棉花。十五日，普遍透雨后，农民生产情绪更加高涨，纷纷进行浸种，给牲口加草料准备播种。省府与专区的农业推广队早已下乡协助工作，大规模播种即将展开。
