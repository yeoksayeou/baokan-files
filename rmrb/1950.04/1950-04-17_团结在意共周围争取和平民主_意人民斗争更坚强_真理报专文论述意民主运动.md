Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The newspaper Pravda recently published an article by Harlin describing the Italian people's struggle for freedom and democracy, stating: The Gasperi government, in order to please American monopoly capitalists, has continuously implemented policies that undermine the country's economic recovery. The Gasperi government's continued increase in military spending has made Italy's economic prospects even dimmer. Its militarization policy, implemented in violation of treaty terms, is entirely part of the plan of American warmongers. Currently, the United States not only controls Italy politically and economically, but also militarily.

The Italian ruling clique has adopted all means to suppress the domestic democratic movement, including intimidation, police repression, mass shooting of working people, and encouragement of neo-fascist movements.

The Italian working class responded to the ruling clique's policies with powerful and widespread protest strikes. In the first five months of 1949 alone, there were 635 strikes in Italy, involving approximately 19,000 enterprises and 2.5 million workers.

The characteristic of the Italian strike movement is its high degree of organization and clearly expressed political nature. In the first three months of this year, the overwhelming majority of strikes were caused by the Italian working people protesting police terror and opposing the government's attempt to deprive the Italian people of basic democratic freedoms.

In the past few months, the Italian people's struggle for peace and against the instigators of a new war has also been further strengthened.

In the fierce class struggle of the Italian working people for peace and democracy, unity is increasingly strengthened, and the desire to win is becoming stronger and stronger. The Italian reactionary groups, at the instigation of overseas figures, have tried to use right-wing socialists and Vatican agents in trade unions to implement a policy of splitting the labor movement, but this policy has been completely defeated. The Italian working people are increasingly united around the Italian Communist Party. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, the National League of Cooperatives, the Agricultural Workers' Union, the Italian Women's League, the Italian Youth League, the All-Italy Guerrilla Association, and other mass organizations of the working people have formed a united front with the Communist Party and are carrying out struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Socialist Party led by Nenni is also actively participating in the struggle against warmongers under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Italy-Soviet Union Association has also begun to play an increasingly important role in domestic public life.

　　团结在意共周围争取和平民主
    意人民斗争更坚强
    真理报专文论述意民主运动
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载哈林的专文，描述意大利人民争取自由和民主的斗争称：加斯贝利政府为了取悦美国垄断资本家，就不断地执行了破坏国家经济复兴的政策。加斯贝利政府继续增加军事开支，使意大利的经济前景变得愈形黯淡。它违反了和约条款而推行的军事化政策，完全是美国战争贩子计划下的一部分。目前，美国不仅在政治上和经济上控制了意大利，而且在军事上也控制了意大利。
    意大利统治集团采取了恫吓、警察镇压、大规模地射杀劳动人民、鼓励新法西斯运动等一切手段，以镇压国内的民主运动。
    意大利工人阶级以强大和广泛的抗议罢工来回答统治集团的政策。仅在一九四九年的头五个月中，意大利共发生了六百三十五次罢工，牵涉及大约一万九千个企业，和二百五十万工人。
    意大利罢工运动的特点是它的高度组织性和明确地表现出来的政治性。在本年的头三个月中，压倒多数的罢工，其起因是意大利劳动人民抗议警察恐怖，反对政府要剥夺意大利人民的基本民主自由的企图。
    在过去数月中，意大利人民争取和平和反对新战争挑拨者的斗争，也更进一步地加强了。
    在意大利劳动人民为了和平民主而进行的激烈的阶级斗争中，团结是愈形加强，争取胜利的意愿是愈来愈强烈了。意大利的反动集团在海外人物的教唆下，力图利用工会中的右翼社会党分子和梵蒂冈代理人，来实现分裂劳工运动的政策，但是，这个政策遭到了彻底的失败。意大利劳动人民日益团结到意大利共产党的周围。意大利总工会、全国合作社联盟、农业工人联合会、意大利妇女联盟、意大利青年联盟、全意游击队协会等等劳动人民的群众组织，都与共产党结成了统一战线，并在共产党的领导下进行斗争。南尼所领导的社会党，也积极地参加了共产党领导下的反对战争贩子的斗争。意苏协会也开始在国内的公众生活中起着愈来愈大的作用。
