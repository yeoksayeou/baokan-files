　　Safeguarding the Legitimate Operation of Industry and Commerce
    Shanghai Handles Industrial and Commercial Registration
    Existing Industries Must Complete Registration Within Two Months
    [This newspaper reports] A summary of news from the Shanghai Liberation Daily: In order to facilitate the implementation of industrial and commercial policies, Shanghai Municipality promulgated industrial and commercial registration measures starting on the 31st of last month, and is now handling industrial and commercial registration throughout the city. Since Shanghai's liberation, industrial and commercial enterprises have not undergone formal registration, which has caused many inconveniences in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies. Therefore, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce invited representatives from industry and commerce, experts, and relevant individuals from various sectors to exchange opinions and formulate registration measures. These were submitted to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government for approval and were promulgated and implemented on March 31st. It stipulates that within two months from the date of promulgation, all industrial and commercial sectors established before the promulgation of these measures must register with their respective trade associations. Those established after the promulgation of these measures must register with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce at least twenty days before opening for business. Their business must first obtain permission from the relevant competent authorities, and a license must be obtained before registration. In order to actively carry out this industrial and commercial registration work, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has appointed Hu Juewen, Rong Yiren, Xiang Shuxiang, and fifteen others as members of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Promotion Committee, responsible for promoting registration in various industries. Shanghai's newspapers have prominently published relevant news and commentary on this industrial and commercial registration. The Liberation Daily also published a short commentary on this, calling on all industries to dispel ideological concerns, fully recognize the fundamental difference between today's industrial and commercial registration and that of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and emphasizing that Shanghai's industry and commerce account for the largest proportion in the country. Industrial and commercial registration is a major event in industrial and commercial administration. It is hoped that all industries will promptly carry out registration, thereby obtaining formal legal protection from the People's Government as a basis for the government to support industry and commerce, so as to fully exert the positive role of industrial and commercial registration in safeguarding and developing Shanghai's industry and commerce.

　　保障工商业正当经营
    沪市办理工商登记
    旧有行业限于两月内登记完毕
    【本报讯】综合上海解放日报消息：上海市为便于贯彻工商业政策，自上月三十一日起颁布工商登记办法，即日起办理全市工商业登记。沪市自解放以来，工商业户迄未办理正式登记，于工商政策推行，诸多不便，因此，工商局方面曾先后邀请工商界、专家及各方面有关人士交换意见，拟订登记办法，呈准沪市人民政府核准，于三月三十一日起颁布施行。自颁布之日起在两个月内，规定凡在该办法颁布前创立之工商各行业，均须向各该同业公会办理登记；在该办法颁布后创立者则一律规定必须在开业二十日以前向工商局办理登记；其业务应先取得有关主管机关许可，在办理登记前应先取得许可证。沪市工商局为了积极办好这次工商登记工作，已聘定胡厥文、荣毅仁、项叔翔等十五人为工商登记推进委员会委员，负责推进各业登记事业。沪市各报对此次工商业登记均以显著地位刊登有关消息和评论。解放日报并为此发表短论，号召各行业解除思想顾虑，应充分认识今日的工商登记与国民党反动派时期有着根本的不同，并着重指出：上海的工商业在全国范围内占有最大的比重，工商登记是工商行政的一件大事，希望各业从速实行登记，由此取得人民政府正式的法律上的保障，作为政府扶植工商业的根据，以充分发挥工商登记在保障和发展上海工商业的积极作用。
