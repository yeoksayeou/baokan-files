　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th (TASS): Pravda recently published an editorial calling for the popularization and wide application of the experiences of industrial pioneers, stating: The Communist Party supports the creative initiatives of the working people in all aspects, encourages and organizes nationwide socialist emulation campaigns, and paves the way for the development of every new, outstanding, and progressive thing. Thanks to the support of the Bolshevik Party, the scale of socialist emulation is expanding, rising to a higher level, and achieving new successes. Emulation has ignited the creative thinking of the working people and cultivated millions of famous industrial pioneers among them. They boldly break down everything outdated and pave new paths in all fields of industry, science, and technology. To study, summarize, popularize, and integrate the experiences of industrial pioneers with production is the Bolshevik responsibility of all Party, Soviet, economic, and trade union organizations. In the nationwide socialist emulation to complete and exceed the post-war Five-Year Plan, the ranks of industrial pioneers and their patriotic proposals will undoubtedly grow day by day. Large-scale publicity and utilization of the pioneers' experiences is an important prerequisite for achieving new victories in communist construction.
