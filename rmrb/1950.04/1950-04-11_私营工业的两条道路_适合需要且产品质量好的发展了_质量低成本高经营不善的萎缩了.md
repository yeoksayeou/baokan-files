Two Paths for Private Industry
    Those that meet needs and have good product quality have developed; those with low quality, high costs, and poor management have shrunk.
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: Currently, some private industrial sectors in Beijing have increased production, while many others have decreased production. There is an urgent need to improve operations, enhance quality, and reduce costs. Some individual sectors are oversupplied and should cease development. According to statistics on the production and sales of private industry in January and February of this year, the production of products that meet current market needs and are of good quality has increased. For example, the rubber industry processes orders for state-owned enterprises such as the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the production of rubber tubes has greatly increased. The total output in January and February was 9,950, an increase of one and a half times the average monthly output in December of last year. In the soap industry, some factories with normal production have improved their technology and quality. The phenomenon of adulterating soap has decreased. The total output in January and February was more than 13,100 boxes, an increase of 4.79% compared to the average monthly output in December of last year. Conversely, the production of some industries has decreased, mainly due to low quality, high costs, poor management, or overproduction under the current market purchasing power. For example, the cost of papermaking is higher than that in Northeast China. The selling price of Northeast "Lu Lu" paper (newsprint) is 130,000 yuan per ream after entering the customs, while the cost in Beijing is 150,000 yuan, and the quality is poor. Industries such as matches, soy sauce, and bean flour have reduced production due to oversupply. The weaving and dyeing industry has also reduced production because most factories are changing specifications for processing cloth for the Huasha Cloth Company, and their technology is not proficient, affecting production. In addition, insufficient power supply in January and February, and excessive holidays taken by some factories during the New Year and Spring Festival when the municipal government was vigorously leading and helping to overcome various difficulties, also had a certain impact on production. In response to the above situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in January and February, in order to lead private industry to overcome difficulties, first mobilized larger factories in various industries to formulate production plans for 1950 based on the factory's production capacity, raw material supply, and market needs, so as to promote the gradual transition of various industries and factories to planned production. Secondly, it adjusted labor-capital relations, and recently called for the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings, and management of factories should absorb workers' opinions. A dispute arose in the Hengdecheng Factory in the weaving and dyeing industry over the implementation of a collective contract between labor and capital. After the government assisted in resolving the dispute, the workers' enthusiasm for production increased, and they renovated the gear wheels of the power looms, allowing each person to watch an additional machine. The output of the entire factory increased by 30%. For industries lacking raw materials, assistance was also provided separately. For example, the iron industry needs pig iron, and under the unified allocation of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, each factory is in contact with the North China Iron and Steel Company to collectively purchase it. The problem of insufficient power has also been initially resolved. The original power outage for industrial use was from 5 pm to 11 pm every night, but now it has been shortened to 7 pm to 9 pm. The Electricity Bureau can provide appropriate consideration for key development industries if they expand production, increase horsepower, or open night shifts.
    Summarizing the production situation of private industry in January and February of this year, it clearly points out: low cost and high quality are the basic links for developing production. Private factories must gradually improve backward production equipment, improve technology, improve quality, reduce costs, and absorb idle funds as much as possible to strengthen turnover capacity. As for industries such as soy sauce, matches, and bean flour, whose production has already shown to be excessive, development should be stopped.

　　私营工业的两条道路
    适合需要且产品质量好的发展了  质量低成本高经营不善的萎缩了
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市私营工业目前有些行业产量增加，也有不少行业产量减少，亟须改善经营，提高品质，降低成本，还有个别行业供过于求，应停止发展。根据今年一、二月份私营工业产销情况统计，凡是适合目前市场需要并且品质较好的产品，产量都已增加，如橡胶业为华北农业机械厂等公营企业加工订货，胶管产量大增，一、二月份共产九千九百五十根，比去年十二月份平均每月增产一倍半。造胰业一部生产正常的工厂，改进技术，提高品质，肥皂掺假现象减少，一、二月份共产肥皂一万三千一百余箱，比去年十二月份平均每月增产百分之四点七九。相反的，也有些行业产量减少，基本原因是品质低、成本高、经营管理不善，或在目前市场购买力的情况下生产过剩。如造纸业的成本即高过东北，东北陆陆纸（报纸）入关每令售价十三万元，而京市成本是十五万元，且品质不佳。火柴、酱油、豆粉等业则因供过于求，因而减产。织染业也减产，原因是大部工厂给花纱布公司织加工布改换规格，技术不熟练，影响产量。此外，一、二月份中，电力供应不足，有些工厂在新年和春节市府正大力领导帮助克服各项困难时放假过多，对生产也有一定的影响。京市人民政府针对上述情况，在一、二月份里，为领导私营工业克服困难，首先动员各行业中较大工厂，根据工厂生产力、原料供应情况、市场需要，订立了一九五○年生产计划，促进各业各厂逐步走向有计划的生产；其次是调整劳资关系，最近并号召组设劳资协商会议，管理工厂要吸取工人意见。织染业恒德成工厂劳资执行集体合同发生纠纷，经政府协助解决，工人生产情绪高涨，改造了电力织布机牙轮，每人可以增看一台机子，全厂产量增加了百分之三十。对缺乏原料的行业，也分别帮助解决，如铁工业需用元铁，正在中央重工业部统一分配下，各工厂与华北钢铁公司接洽集体采购。电力不足的问题，也已初步解决，工业用电原来每晚五时至十一时要停电，现缩短为七时至九时，对重点发展的行业，若扩大生产，增加马力或增开夜班，电业局可予适当照顾。
    综合今年一、二月份私营工业生产情况，鲜明指出：成本低、品质高是发展生产的基本环节，私营工厂必须逐渐改进落后的生产设备，改进技术，提高品质，降低成本，尽可能的吸收游资，加强周转能力，至于超过目前市场需要生产已显过剩的行业如酱油、火柴、豆粉等业，即应停止发展。
