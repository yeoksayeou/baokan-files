　　After Viewing "Springtime in Inner Mongolia"
    After seeing "Springtime in Inner Mongolia," I felt very excited and a sense of closeness.

    This film primarily demonstrates that the Inner Mongolian revolution is a part of the Chinese revolution. Over the past twenty-nine years, the Chinese Communist Party has correctly implemented Marxist-Leninist ethnic policies, consistently caring for ethnic minorities, cultivating a large number of ethnic minority cadres, and first helping the Eastern Mongolian fraternal ethnic groups establish people's armies and political power, embarking on the path of liberation.

    This film uses a vivid story to illustrate the importance of unity between Mongolian and Han people, and criticizes the views of Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. One Mongolian youth shed tears after watching it and reflected, "I used to have the narrow nationalist views of the character in the play. This film has given me a great education."

    The film vividly and powerfully exposes how American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Han chauvinists colluded with the Mongolian upper-class rulers and princes to oppress the Mongolian and Han compatriots, and how they shamelessly provoked the feelings of the Mongolian and Han people, implementing their policy of division and deception.

    In short, this film enables us to have a deeper understanding of the Communist Party's correct ethnic policy and the Common Program's stipulation that: "All ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, practice unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within the nation, so that the People's Republic of China becomes a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups."

    Director Gan Xuewei, screenwriter Wang Zhenzhi, and other comrades who made this film went deep into Inner Mongolia's grasslands, Beizi Temple, Hailar, and other places from Ulanhot during the severe winter last year, fearing no difficulties, visiting and investigating everywhere, and engaging in writing and photography. This spirit is very good. Now that this artistic work has finally been completed, it is a very gratifying and congratulatory event.

　　《内蒙春光》观后
    看了《内蒙春光》以后，觉得很兴奋，很亲切。
    这影片首先表现了内蒙革命是中国革命的一部分，中国共产党二十九年来，正确执行了马列主义的民族政策，对少数民族一贯关心，培养了大批的少数民族的干部，首先帮助了东蒙兄弟民族建立人民的军队和政权，走上解放的道路。
    这部电影，用生动的故事说明了蒙汉人民团结的重要性，批判了大汉族主义和狭隘民族主义观点。一个蒙族青年看了后流泪了，自己反省地说：“我过去就有剧中人的狭隘民族观点，这个片子给了我很大的教育。”
    在影片中又很生动有力地揭露了美帝国主义者与蒋匪大汉族主义者如何和蒙古的上层统治者，王公勾结，压迫蒙汉同胞，并卑鄙无耻的挑拨蒙汉人民的感情，施行他的分化愚弄政策。
    总之，这部电影，能使我们对共产党的正确的民族政策和共同纲领中所规定的：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。”有更深刻的认识。
    导演干学伟编剧王震之以及其他摄制这部影片的同志们，在去年严冬，从乌兰浩特深入内蒙草原贝子庙海拉尔等地，不怕困难，到处访问调查，从事写作、摄影，这种精神是很好的。现在，这个艺术作品终于完成了，这是非常值得高兴和庆贺的一件事。
