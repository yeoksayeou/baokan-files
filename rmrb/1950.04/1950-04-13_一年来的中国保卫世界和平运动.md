　　The Chinese Movement to Defend World Peace Over the Past Year
    Liu Ningyi

    It has been a year since the World Peace Congress was held. In this year, the Chinese people have achieved unprecedented and great victories.

    At this time last year, we were attending the World Peace Congress in Prague. At the meeting, representatives of peace-loving people from all countries condemned the US imperialists' conspiracy to provoke a new war and called on the people of the world to unite and defend peace. When the presidium announced that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army has taken practical actions to defend peace, and a million-strong army has crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Nanjing," the whole audience burst into thunderous applause and cheers: "Celebrate the liberation of Nanjing!" "Take Shanghai!" "Take Guangdong!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    After a year of hard work, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, our people and the People's Liberation Army have advanced rapidly, completely crushing the US imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang, on the Chinese mainland. The US imperialists' conspiracy to invade China and turn China into an anti-Soviet base has completely failed. The Chinese people have answered the hopes of their comrades in the world who defend peace. We have liberated Shanghai and Guangdong. We are redoubling our efforts to eliminate the US imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang remnant bandits. The complete liberation of all of China is in sight, which will further consolidate peace in the East and peace in the world.

    Over the past year, the strength of the Chinese people has become even stronger, and it has become a huge force in defending world peace.

    The birth of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of the four hundred and seventy-five million people's right to manage the country. Our ancient Eastern nation has since opened a new historical chapter. This is a significant and indelible contribution to the cause of world progressive humanity in defending peace and the great struggle for a better future.

    The two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, with a population of seven hundred million, have implemented sincere unity and cooperation. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance not only provides a strong guarantee for the consolidation and development of the new China, but also an invincible force for defending lasting world peace.

    Over the past year, the Chinese movement to defend world peace has merged with the worldwide movement to defend peace, forming a vast ocean, surging forward.

    The day after the birth of the People's Republic of China was "World Day of Struggle for the Defense of Peace." In Beijing, the capital of our new China, a grand Chinese Conference for the Defense of World Peace was held, attended by delegations from the Soviet Union, Korea, and Italy. The Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace was established. The people of China, with extreme joy and unusual solemnity, held solemn and great mass rallies across the country, celebrating the birth of their own Central People's Government and vowing to fight resolutely for the defense of lasting world peace.

    Since then, our workers, youth, and women representatives have continuously gone abroad to participate in the congresses of world organizations, engaging in the unity and struggle of the common cause of international peace. At the same time, the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution made it possible for two major important international conferences, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference, to open grandly in Beijing, the capital of the new China. These two conferences studied the path of liberation that the oppressed peoples of Asian countries should take and reached a unanimous conclusion: only by forming a united front of the whole nation under the leadership of the working class and its political party—the Communist Party—and taking armed struggle as the main form of struggle for national liberation, can national independence and liberation be achieved. There is no doubt that these two major conferences will play a significant role in the further development of the Eastern national liberation movement, thereby providing a more powerful guarantee for the cause of world peace.

    After the establishment of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, it has closely watched every action of the imperialists to undermine peace. We have lodged serious protests and exposures against the US imperialists' refusal to allow peace delegations to enter the country and the British and Dutch authorities' suppression of the peace movement. At the same time, we have actively supported the peace movements of the people of all countries. We have sent representatives to participate in the Soviet Union's Peace Congress and sent telegrams to celebrate the Peace Congresses of the people of the United States and Latin America.

    In order to further deepen the national peace movement, we have established a permanent working committee and decided to first establish branches in eleven major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin, in order to launch a broader and more in-depth great movement to defend world peace.

　　一年来的中国保卫世界和平运动
    刘宁一
    从世界拥护和平大会召开以来，已经过去一年了。在这一年当中，中国人民已取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    我们在去年这个时候，正在布拉格开世界拥护和平大会。在这个会上，各国爱好和平的代表们，控诉了美帝国主义者挑拨新战争的阴谋，号召全世界的人民团结起来，捍卫和平。当主席团宣读“中国人民解放军已经以实际行动保卫和平，百万大军渡过了长江，解放了南京”的时候，全场掌声雷动，热烈欢呼：“庆祝南京解放”！“拿上海”！“取广东”！“毛泽东万岁”！
    经过了一年的功夫，我全国人民和人民解放军在毛主席的正确领导下，迅速前进，将美帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮在中国大陆上彻底粉碎了。美帝国主义企图侵略中国，将中国变为反苏基地的阴谋完全破产了。中国人民已经回答了全世界保卫和平的战友们的希望，我们解放了上海，解放了广东。我们正在加倍努力，为肃清美帝国主义及其走狗国民党残匪势力而斗争。全中国的完全解放已在眼前，这将使东方的和平和世界的和平更加巩固。
    一年来，中国人民的力量是更加强大了，它已成为保卫世界和平的一支巨力。
    中华人民共和国的诞生，四万万七千五百万人民开始当权管理国家。我们这个古老的东方民族，从此揭开了新的历史巨册。这对于世界进步人类保卫和平事业，和为美好的未来而进行的伟大斗争，是一个具有重大意义的、永远不可磨灭的贡献。
    包括七万万人口的中苏两大民族，实行了真诚的团结合作。中苏两国友好同盟互助条约的签订，这不但使新中国获得了巩固发展的有力保障，而且是保卫世界持久和平的无敌力量。
    一年来，中国保卫世界和平的运动，和全世界保卫和平的运动打成了一片，形成了汪洋大海，汹涌前进。
    中华人民共和国诞生的次日，就是“世界保卫和平斗争日”。在我新中国的首都北京，召开了盛大的，有苏联、朝鲜代表团及意大利代表都参加的中国保卫世界和平大会。成立了中国保卫世界和平大会委员会。全中国的人民，以极度欢欣而又异常严肃的心情，在全国各地举行了庄严伟大的群众大会，一面庆祝自己的中央人民政府的诞生，一面誓言为保卫世界的持久和平而坚决斗争。
    从此以后，我们的工人、青年和妇女代表，不断出国参加了世界组织的大会，从事国际和平共同事业的团结和斗争。同时，中国人民革命的伟大胜利，使得亚澳工会代表会议和亚洲妇女代表会议这样两大重要国际会议，在新中国的首都北京隆重开幕了。这两个会议研究了亚洲各国被压迫民族人民所要走的解放道路，并得出一致的结论：只有组成在工人阶级及其政党——共产党领导下的全民族的统一战线，并以武装斗争作为民族解放斗争的主要斗争形式，才能得到民族的独立和解放。毫无疑问，这两大会议对于东方民族解放运动的进一步发展，将起着很大的作用，从而也将使世界和平的事业，得到更有力的保证。
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会成立后，密切注视着帝国主义者每一个破坏和平的行动。我们曾给与美帝国主义者的拒绝和平代表团入境，英、荷当局的压迫和平运动，予以严重的抗议和揭发。同时我们对于各国人民保卫和平的运动则予以积极的声援，我们曾派遣了代表参加苏联拥护和平大会，并致电庆祝美国和拉丁美洲等国人民的保卫和平大会。
    为了使全国保卫和平运动更加深入，我们成立了经常的工作委员会，并决定首先在上海、南京、天津等十一个大城市设立分会，以便更广泛而深入地展开保卫世界和平的大运动。
