　　A Method to Promote Production and Disaster Relief
    Ningbao Heavily Afflicted Area Assesses Cadres
    Selects Disaster Relief Models Han Tianshun and Four Others
    Those Ineffective in Disaster Relief Are Punished Accordingly
    [By our correspondent An Zhenying] This newspaper reports: The Ningbao Disaster Area Work Committee in Hebei convened a meeting of all cadres in late March to summarize production and disaster relief work, assess cadres, and select Han Tianshun, Wang Jinsheng, and four others as production and disaster relief models. In late January, the Tianjin Special District dispatched over 200 cadres to the Ningbao disaster area to specifically assist in the work. Over the past two months, thanks to the launch of the great mass movement of production for self-salvation, the serious disaster situation in the area has been halted from developing further, and the lives of the masses have improved. In the arduous struggle against the disaster, a large number of model workers loved by the masses have emerged. In the summary meeting in the area, after democratic assessment in group meetings, district-based meetings, and plenary meetings, Han Tianshun, Yang Xiurong (female), Wang Jinsheng, Pi Shouyu, and Zhao Yaoxian were selected as disaster relief models, Lin Xia (female), Duan Youhui, and eleven others were commended, and Wang Pengfei and five others were criticized and punished accordingly. The characteristics of the assessment were: democratic assessment from bottom to top, from groups to the general assembly. The assessment was based on the three requirements put forward to the cadres by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government when they entered the disaster area: 1. In-depth work and arduous life; 2. Completion of tasks and support from the masses; 3. Creativity and good disaster relief work. The assessment results were unanimously agreed that the rewards and criticisms were appropriate. At the conference, the typical deeds reports of the model cadres provided great enlightenment, education, and encouragement to all cadres. The comrades who were commended unanimously stated that their work was not good enough and that they should continue to work hard, just as Wang Jinsheng said: "In the future, we must work harder and lead the masses to overcome the spring famine." When the Eighth District group discussed how to lead the masses to work on river projects in the future, all the comrades were very excited. Six women cadres, including Liu Wenshu, signed up to participate in the river project and challenged other districts. Zhang Junfeng, who was criticized in the Second District group, was determined to correct his mistakes and strive to make contributions in his work.

　　推动生产救灾的一个方法
    宁宝重灾区评定干部
    选出救灾模范韩天顺等五人
    救灾不力者均分别受到处分
    【本报讯】本报通讯员安振英报导：河北宁宝灾区工作委员会于三月下旬，召开全体干部会议，总结生产救灾工作，评定干部，选出韩天顺、王金生等五人为生产救灾模范。一月下旬，天津专区抽调二百余名干部到宁宝灾区具体帮助工作。两个月来，由于伟大的群众性生产自救运动开展，已使该区严重灾情停止发展，群众生活改善。在与灾荒的艰苦斗争中，涌现了大批为群众爱戴的模范工作者。在该区总结大会中，经过小组会、区为单位的会、全体大会的民主评定，选出韩天顺、杨秀荣（女）、王金生、邳守玉、赵耀先等五人为救灾模范，林霞（女）、段有辉等十一人受表扬，王鹏飞等五人受批评，并分别给以处分。评定的特点是：从小组到大会，自下而上的民主评定。评定是根据进入灾区工作时中共省委与省府向干部所提出的三项要求：一、工作深入，生活艰苦；二、完成任务，为群众拥护；三、有创造，作好救灾工作。评定结果，全体一致认为：受奖与受批评都恰如其分。大会上，模范干部的典型事迹报告，给全体干部极大的启示、教育与鼓励。受到表扬的同志一致表示，工作还不够，要继续努力，正如王金生说：“今后更得努力，好好领导群众渡过春荒。”八区组讨论今后如何领导群众作河工时，全体同志十分振奋，刘文书等六个妇女干部，报名参加河工工作，并向各区挑战。二区组受批评的张俊峰，决心改正错误，争取在工作中立功。
