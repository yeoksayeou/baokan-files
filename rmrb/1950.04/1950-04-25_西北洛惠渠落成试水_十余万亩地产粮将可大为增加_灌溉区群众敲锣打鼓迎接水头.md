　　Northwest Luo River-Huimin Canal Completed and Trial Water Diversion Begins
    Grain Production on Over 100,000 Mu of Land Will Be Greatly Increased
    Masses in the Irrigated Area Beat Drums and Gongs to Welcome the Water Flow
    [Report from this newspaper] Xi'an Masses Daily News: The famous Luo River-Huimin Canal, a massive water conservancy project in the Northwest Dali Special District, successfully completed its first phase of tasks by the 10th of this month. It can irrigate 100,000 mu of land, and water will be officially released for irrigation at the end of the month. In mid-May, another 50,000 to 100,000 mu of land will be added to the irrigation area. The project began on November 6th of last year, and by the 10th of this month, it had taken five months and four days, using 350,352 workdays, excavating 544,534 cubic meters of earthwork, newly building and renovating five giant structures, over twenty medium-sized structures, and over one hundred and fifty small structures, completing 55% of the total renovation project. Trial water diversion began on the 1st of this month, starting with a water flow of two cubic meters per second and gradually increasing to five cubic meters per second. By 6:00 AM on the 10th, the main canal, the West Second Canal, and four branch canals had all been tested with water. The masses in the irrigated area were overjoyed when they saw the water coming, beating drums and gongs to welcome the water flow. Meng Defang from Donghan Village said, "This isn't just water; it's grain. Because one mu of land yields two more dou, ten mu yields two shi. Look how much more we'll harvest in a year!" Wang Junhe from Yijing Village said, "Since I was born, this is the second happiest event; the first was when the People's Liberation Army drove away Hu Zongnan." The masses in Dongxiaopo Village used to dig three cubic meters of earth in a day, but on the 8th, to get water into their village, each person dug eight cubic meters of earth in a single day.
  Masses Had Eagerly Awaited for More Than a Decade; Completed in Five Months After Liberation
    This canal was surveyed and designed in 1933 and construction began in 1934. However, the reactionary Kuomintang government did not build the canal to improve the lives of the broad masses of people, but to extract more blood and sweat from the working people. In addition, the fifth tunnel encountered quicksand and underground springs, creating objective difficulties in construction, causing hundreds of thousands of people in the irrigated area to wait eagerly for more than a decade, never getting to irrigate their fields. When the Guanzhong area was initially liberated, while the Northwest War was still ongoing, the People's Government, in the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, despite extreme economic difficulties, immediately paid a large amount of construction funds (the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government allocated 15 million jin of wheat this year as a water conservancy loan for renovating the canal) to resume the project. After the establishment of the Luo River-Huimin Canal Engineering Office on October 1, 1949, under the leadership of Deputy Directors Li Kuishun and Fu Jian, after more than a month of active planning, construction officially began on November 6th. First, a breakthrough was achieved by focusing efforts and concentrating forces to renovate the 3,400-meter-long fifth tunnel. Through the efforts of all employees, working in shifts day and night, with each shift working up to twelve hours, the difficult tasks of installing arches and repairing walls were basically completed by the end of December. The completion of this arduous project quickly dispelled the doubts of the broad masses that if the fifth tunnel was not open, the other projects would be in vain, stimulated the enthusiasm for supporting the project, and also boosted the confidence of the cadres, thereby accelerating the progress of the entire project. The original plan to release water for irrigation on 50,000 to 100,000 mu of land by the end of June this year was completed ahead of schedule by the end of April, and then it was planned to add another 50,000 to 100,000 mu of land to the irrigation area by the end of June. According to the responsible comrades of the Engineering Office, the entire project will be completed by mid-May.
  Party and Government Organs Strongly Lead the Construction, Combined with Disaster Relief, and the Masses Enthusiastically Participate
    The progress of the project is so fast mainly due to: (1) The active leadership of the Party and government and the strong cooperation of relevant departments. The renovation of the canal is related to the welfare of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs regard it as one of the central tasks. The Dali Commissioner's Office and the CPC Prefectural Committee have held several special meetings to study and discuss it. The Commissioner and the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee often go to the Engineering Office to check the progress of the work and personally inspect the construction site. They also organized the Luo River-Huimin Canal Irrigation Area Working Committee, dispatching capable cadres such as the section chiefs of the Commissioner's Office and the county heads to go deep into the masses, organize and educate disaster victims and laborers, solve practical problems, and promote the work. In addition, the strong assistance of various departments, such as the bank providing the masses in the irrigation area with loans of 140 shi of wheat, and the trade company helping to purchase grain, oil, and salt. When the construction funds were not available, the Commissioner's Office immediately lent 300,000 jin of wheat, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the project. (2) In the movements to support the front, mass movements, and production for disaster relief, the masses saw clearly that the feudal forces would never monopolize water rights, and that the canal was being built for themselves, thereby improving the working enthusiasm of the working masses. In the past, they could only dig a little more than one cubic meter of earth in a day, but now they dig an average of more than three cubic meters per person. At the same time, democracy was used to bring the wisdom of the masses into play. For example, near the 13th well of the most arduous and dangerous fifth tunnel of the entire renovation project, because there were three mud pits above, quicksand was moving, and water was constantly dripping down, and the tunnel arches were deformed, this renovation project was carried out after democratic discussion by the workers, with sufficient materials prepared, concentrating forces, and completing this most arduous task under the intense continuous work of ninety people for eleven hours. Old worker Mao Kuixian (chairman of the trade union) took the lead, influencing others, so that they, more than ninety people, used to clear seven meters of silt every day, and soon reached twenty-one meters. For example, the Wang Pingfan shed, which was managed by the workers themselves, made the economy public, and everyone evaluated the grades, more work more pay, so that each person averaged two cubic meters of gray soil, increasing to two and seven-tenths cubic meters. The disaster victims in the West Branch Canal who were working for relief after the competition was launched, increased from more than one cubic meter of earth per person per day to five cubic meters. The eleventh team worked in the moonlight, and the ninth assault team dug seven cubic meters every day. In order to release water ahead of schedule, the workers doubled their efforts and put forward the resounding slogan that water will come when the canal is completed. Under the leadership of Dang Shouren, the head of the Siluo Village of the Xuyuan District of Dali, the task to be completed by the end of April was completed before April 10, with each person digging up to eight cubic meters of earth per day. (3) The canal construction project is closely linked to the current interests of the masses. This district is a heavy disaster area in the Northwest. When prices fluctuated last winter and other sideline production was not easy to engage in, a large number of farmers participated in the construction project of the Luo River-Huimin Canal. Those with livestock transported stones, food, and materials, etc.; those without livestock worked, so that the disaster victims also got a way to produce. According to statistics, the masses earned freight equivalent to more than 1.54 million jin of wheat in transportation, solving the livelihood of 16,000 people for a month. The disaster situation in the area has been greatly alleviated. In particular, more than 10,000 refugees who fled from other places were used. This group of labor force was used for work relief, absorbing 2,000 disaster victims to work, solving the livelihoods of 7,000 to 8,000 people. In the middle of the spring plowing season, the masses saw that the water was about to come down. At this time, Dali County convened a timely agricultural congress, proposing the slogan "men repair the canal, women go to the fields to weed wheat." It immediately received a response from the masses. In the four districts of Dali Xuyuan, Pingyuan, Luobin, and Shangyan, 50% to 60% of the wheat was weeded by women, and in some places 80% was weeded by women. Therefore, a part of the labor force was saved to participate in the canal repair. (Xue Yonglin, Guo Yishan)

　　西北洛惠渠落成试水
    十余万亩地产粮将可大为增加
    灌溉区群众敲锣打鼓迎接水头
    【本报讯】西安群众日报消息：西北大荔专区著名的洛惠渠巨大水利工程截至本月十日止，第一期任务顺利完成，可灌溉十万亩土地，月底可正式放水灌田；五月中旬将再增灌五万至十万亩土地。该工程开始于去年十一月六日，至本月十日，共费五个月零四天的时间，三十五万零三百五十二个工，做土方五十四万四千五百三十四立方公尺，新修与整修巨型建筑物五座、中型二十余座、小型一百五十余座，已完成全部整修工程的百分之五十五。并于本月一日开始试水，由二秒立方公尺的水量，逐渐增加到五秒立方公尺，至十日上午六时，总干渠、西二干渠及四个斗渠均已试水。灌溉区的群众，望见水下来时，兴高彩烈，敲锣打鼓，迎接水头。东汉村的蒙德芳说“这不是水是粮食，因为一亩地多收二斗，十亩就两石，你看一年多收多少哩？”义井村的王俊和说：“我出生以来这是第二件喜事；第一件是解放军打走胡宗南。”东小坡村群众，往日挖土三方，八日那天为使水放在他们村，一天每人挖了八方土。
  群众眼巴巴等待十多年解放后五个月即告完成
    按该渠在一九三三年测量设计，一九三四年动工。但由于国民党反动政府，修渠不是为广大人民过好光景，而是为了更多的吸取劳动人民的血汗。加之第五号隧洞，遭遇流沙潜泉，施工艰巨的客观困难，致使灌溉区的数十万人民，眼巴巴的等待了十几年，始终未得灌溉田地。当关中地区初获解放，西北战争尚在进行之际，人民政府本着高度为人民服务的精神，在经济极端困难的条件下，即支付大批工程费（中央人民政府政务院水利部本年拨付麦子一千五百万市斤，作为整修该渠的水利贷款），恢复工程。一九四九年十月一日，洛惠渠工程处成立后，在李奎顺、傅健正副处长领导下，经过月余积极筹划，于十一月六日正式动工。首先采取重点突破，集中力量，整修长达三千四百公尺的第五号隧洞，经过全体员工的努力，昼夜分班、每班工作达十二小时，使落碹修墙各项艰巨工作，于十二月底基本完成。由于这一艰巨工程的完成，使广大群众对第五号隧洞不通其它工程白修的疑虑，迅速消失，刺激了支援工程的积极性，也提高了干部的信心，从而使整个工程的进度加速，原计划今年六月底放水灌溉五万至十万亩土地的任务，提前至四月底完成，后又计划于六月底再增加灌溉五万至十万亩土地的任务。据该工程处负责同志谈，五月中旬即可完成全部工程。
  党政机关大力领导修建结合救灾群众热烈参加
    工程的进度所以这样快，主要是由于：（一）党政积极领导及有关部门的有力配合。该渠的整修是关系着广大人民的福利。因而党政领导机关，都视为中心工作之一。大荔专员公署、中共地委曾数次召开专门会议，研究讨论，专员、地委书记经常去工程处检查工作的进行情况、亲去工地视察。并组织洛惠渠灌溉区工作委员会，抽派专署科长、县长等得力干部，率领三十多个行政干部，深入群众，组织教育灾难民及民工，具体解决实际问题，推动工作。加之各部门有力的协助，如银行贷款给灌溉区群众小麦一百四十市石，贸易公司帮助购买粮食及油盐，工程费接连不上，专署即借给三十万斤小麦，因而，使工程顺利进行。（二）在支援前线、群众运动、生产救灾等运动中，使群众看清了封建势力绝不会霸占水权，渠是给自己开的，因而提高了劳动群众的工作情绪。过去一天只能挖一方多土，现在平均每人挖三方多土。同时，运用民主，发挥了群众智慧，如全部整修工程中最艰巨而危险的第五号隧洞的第十三号井附近，因为上面有三处泥窟窿，流沙游动，不断往下滴水，洞碹变形，此一整修工程，即经过工人民主讨论，准备好充足材料，集中力量，在九十个人十一个钟头的紧张连续工作下，完成了这一最艰巨的任务。十几年的老工人毛奎先（工会主任）自己做在前面，影响别人，使他们九十多个人，以前每天清淤七公尺，很快就达到二十一公尺。如发动工人自己管理的王屏藩棚子，经济公开，大家评定等级，多劳多得，因而使每人平均打灰土两方，提高至两方七。西一支渠以工代赈的灾难民，在发动竞赛后，由每人一天挖土一方多提高至五方，十一队在月光下做活，九队突击组每天挖七方。工人们为了提前放水，加倍努力，提出了水到渠成的响亮口号。大荔许塬区斯罗寨斗长党守仁领导下，四月底要完成的任务，在四月十日前完成，每人一天挖至八方土。（三）修渠工程与群众当前利益紧密的结合一起。该分区为西北的重灾区，当去冬物价波动，其他副业生产不好搞时，大批农民，即参加洛惠渠的修建工程，有牲口的运石头、食粮、材料等；无牲口的做工，因而使灾民也得到了生产门路。据统计群众在运输中得运费折麦一百五十四万余市斤，解决了一万六千人一个月的生活问题。使该地的灾情大大减轻。特别是外处逃来一万多难民，运用这批劳力，用以工代赈的办法，吸收两千灾难民做工，解决了七八千人的生活问题。在春耕开始的当中，群众眼看见水就要下来，此时大荔县适时的召开农代会，提出男人修渠，女人下地锄麦的口号。立即获得群众响应，大荔许塬、平原、洛滨、商颜四个区的麦子，百分之五六十是妇女锄的，个别地方百分之八十是妇女锄的。因此节省一部劳力参加修渠。（薛永林、郭一山）
