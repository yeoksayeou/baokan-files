In grain transport work, the masses suffered huge losses.
Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office inspects reasons for errors.
Punishes negligent personnel and voluntarily requests provincial government punishment.
[This Newspaper] The Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Pingyuan Province made a report to the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government on March 17 regarding the errors that occurred in the grain transport work last winter in the Liaocheng Prefecture of Pingyuan Province. Tao Dongdai, Commissioner of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and Ma Jinghan, Deputy Commissioner, also wrote to this newspaper on March 25, saying: "Comrades in charge of the People's Daily: Regarding the injuries and deaths of livestock in our region during the grain transport work last winter, after receiving the criticism in People's Daily No. 625, we immediately conducted an inspection, which is now compiled and sent to you for public publication in the People's Daily." The original report is as follows:
	From December 3, 1949, to January 10, 1950, we accepted the task of transporting 23 million catties of grain. We did not conduct thorough research and planning, but only held a meeting of county warehouse directors before making arrangements, resulting in huge losses to the masses, with 14 people injured (3 in Yanggu, 1 in Tangyi, 3 in Liaocheng, and 7 in Chiping), 58 livestock injured (57 in Yanggu and 1 in Guanxian), 57 livestock dead (20 in Yanggu, 1 in Tangyi, 21 in Liaocheng, 9 in Chiping, and 6 in Boping), and more than 200 large cart parts damaged. The reasons for this huge loss are:
	(1) Contracted transport mentality: At that time, it was stipulated that the transportation fee was two liang of rice per li per 100 catties of public grain, and it was assumed that the masses had income and that it was a hiring relationship. The government was not responsible for any losses. This view is a merchant's view, separating the interests of the government from the interests of the people, only caring about the public's expenses and not caring about the huge losses of the people. This is treating oneself as the employer and the people as the employees, a top-down統制 thinking. It failed to clarify that the People's Government is all for the benefit of the people.
	(2) Paralysis and Optimistic thinking: It was thought that after the autumn grain collection was completed and the grain was concentrated, the transfer and transportation would be easy. It did not consider that winter had arrived and the weather might change; the difficulties that small hired cattle and broken carts might encounter, resulting in losses after heavy snow.
	(3) Insufficient attention to grain transport work: There was no good organization of forces beforehand, fearing that drawing too many cadres would affect the central work (at that time, it was the production center combined with party rectification to end land reform), demonstrating a isolated, single-handed approach to the central work -- thinking that it was not the central work, and relaxing leadership.
	(4) Failure to deal with it in a timely manner afterwards: ① Cadres only saw the hard work of completing the task, but did not see the huge losses of the masses, losing the principled nature of the policy towards cadres and the seriousness of being responsible to the masses, fully demonstrating sectarian thinking, resulting in the evil consequences of appeasing cadres and harming the masses. ② Failure to provide timely compensation for the losses of the masses.
	Corrective measures: ① Convene relevant cadres to conduct in-depth review. ② Communicate the review results to the entire region to educate cadres, in order to achieve the purpose of rectifying discipline and strengthening the mass viewpoint. ③ Adjust cadres and improve leadership to strengthen warehouse work. ④ Cadres with serious mistakes should be given due punishment.
	Handling opinions: ① Zhao Fengsheng, director of the district warehouse, and Yuan Xinzhai, deputy director, were given demerits for their task-oriented viewpoint of being impatient for success due to insufficient prior planning. ② Song Ruizhai, deputy county magistrate of Chiping, was given a warning for failing to study or think of solutions when the financial section chief and warehouse director requested instructions after a sudden change in the situation after the heavy snow, and for failing to deal with it afterwards; Bai Shaojiu, the warehouse director of the county, was given a demerit for insufficient prior planning and for failing to actively understand the situation and put forward handling opinions afterwards. ③ Bai Youkuan, director of the Gaotang warehouse, was dismissed from his post for his work was not thorough, and after the heavy snow, the grain stations were crowded with carts, the grain could not be unloaded, and the masses waited in the freezing cold, but he turned a blind eye. ④ Yang Mingge, chief of the financial section of Shenxian County, was given a warning for blindly directing with telephone calls without making specific inspections, causing chaos in the order of the porters and carts, resulting in losses. ⑤ Jiang Rongxing, director of the Yanggu County warehouse, only made arrangements for repairing roads during grain transport, but did not conduct inspections; even though it was a short-distance transport, it caused huge losses to the masses; and afterwards, he did not report to the county magistrate or put forward handling opinions. This shows extreme irresponsibility for the interests of the people and was given a warning. ⑥ Although Liaocheng County suffered heavy losses in grain transport, this was mainly due to the long distance, the sudden heavy snow, and the insufficient preparation of the Linqing Grain Company; all the cadres were generally hardworking and responsible, and apart from ordering the county to conduct an in-depth review, no punishment will be given.
	In short, the fundamental reason for this huge loss is our weak mass concept. Through this lesson, we have further clarified the relationship between the government and the people, and we have the determination and confidence to correct our mistakes. We have submitted the above inspection and handling opinions to the higher authorities for review, and have requested the higher-level government to give us the punishment we deserve.

　　运粮工作中使群众受巨大损失
    聊城专署检查错误原因
    处分失职人员并自请省府处分
    【本报讯】平原省聊城专区在去冬运粮工作中发生的错误，聊城专署已于三月十七日向平原省人民政府作了检查报告。平原省聊城专署专员陶东岱、副专员马景汉并于三月二十五日致函本报称：“人民日报社负责同志：关于我区去冬在运粮工作中，伤人、死牲畜的事情，自接到人民日报六二五期上批评以后，我们当即作了检查，现整理出来，特寄去，请在人民日报上公开予以发表。”此项报告原文如下：
    一九四九年十二月三日至一九五○年一月十日，我们接受了运粮二千三百万斤的任务。我们没有很周密地研究计划，只开了县仓库主任会议，即布置下去，以致造成群众的巨大损失，病伤十四人（阳谷三人、堂邑一人、聊城三人、茌平七人），伤牲口五十八头（阳谷五十七头、冠县一头）、死牲口五十七头（阳谷二十头、堂邑一头、聊城二十一头、茌平九头、博平六头），损坏大车零件二百多件，造成这巨大损失的原因是：
    （一）包运思想：当时规定百斤公粮每里二两米的运费，便以为群众有收入，是雇佣性质，所有损失，公家一概不管。这种观点是商人观点，把政府的利益与人民的利益分开，只顾公家不多花费，不顾人民的损失如何巨大；这是自己当雇主，人民当雇工，本末倒置的统制思想。没有弄清人民政府一切都是为了人民利益。
    （二）麻痹乐观思想：以为秋征完成了，粮食集中起来了，光调运很容易。没有考虑到冬季已到，天气可能变化；征雇的小牛破车，可能遭遇的困难，以致大雪后，遭受损失。
    （三）对运粮工作重视不够：在事前未有很好的组织力量，怕抽干部多影响了中心工作（当时是以生产中心结合整党结束土改），表现了孤立的进行中心工作的单打一作风，——认为不是中心工作，即放松领导。
    （四）事后没有及时处理：①对干部只看到艰苦地完成任务，没有看到群众的巨大损失，失去了对干部政策的原则性，和对群众负责的严肃性，充分的表现了宗派思想，造成姑息了干部、危害了群众的恶果。②对群众的损失未作及时的赔偿。
    纠正办法：①召集有关干部进行深刻检查。②将检查结果通报全区，教育干部，以达到整顿纪律、加强群众观点之目的。③调整干部，改进领导，以加强仓库工作。④对错误严重之干部，予以应得之处分。
    处理意见：①区库主任赵凤升副主任袁心斋，因事前计划不周，急于求成之任务观点，给予记过处分。②茌平副县长宋瑞斋，因大雪后情况突变，财科长仓库主任请示办法，既不研究又不想办法，事后又不作处理，给予警告处分；该县仓库主任白韶九，事前计划不周，事后不主动了解情况，提出处理意见给予记过处分。③高唐仓库主任白有宽，工作不深入，大雪后粮站大车拥挤，粮食卸不下，群众在冰天雪地中等候，他竟置若罔闻，给予撤职处分。④莘县财科长杨明阁，只用电话盲目指挥，不作具体检查，致使民夫大车秩序紊乱，造成损失，给予警告处分。⑤阳谷县仓库主任蒋荣兴，在运粮中，对修整道路只作了布置，未作检查；虽为短距离运输，竟使群众遭受巨大损失；事后又未向其县长作报告，提出处理意见。这表现了对人民利益极度的不负责任，给予警告处分。⑥聊城县在运粮中虽遭受重大损失，主要是因路途遥远，又忽遇大雪及临清粮食公司准备不足而造成；所有干部一般都很努力负责，除令该县作深刻检查外，不给予处分。
    总之造成这次巨大损失的根本原因，是我们群众观念不强。经这次教训，我们进一步明确政民关系，并有决心、有信心纠正错误。现已将以上检查及处理意见呈请上级审核外，已提请上级政府给予我们应得之处分。
