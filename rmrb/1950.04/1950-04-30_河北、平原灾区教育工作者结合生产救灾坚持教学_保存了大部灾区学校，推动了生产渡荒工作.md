Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd—Educators in the disaster areas of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have combined production and disaster relief to persist in teaching, preserving most of the disaster area schools, and promoting production to overcome famine.

Last year, a quarter of Hebei Province's land was flooded; Pingyuan Province was almost entirely affected by the disaster. At that time, schools in the disaster areas faced serious threats of closure, the number of students decreased significantly, and parents all thought: "Without food and clothing, how can children study?" Some teachers were also pessimistic and disappointed. Later, due to the correct leadership of governments at all levels, most teachers persisted in their work, educating the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, and organizing students to engage in production during their spare time, which was supported by the masses, and the schools in the disaster areas were able to be preserved. For example, in the five severely affected counties of Yutai, Jiaxiang, Nanwang, Liangshan, and Shouzhang in Pingyuan Province, 79.1% of the primary schools continued to operate; Liangshan also added three higher primary schools, and Yutai and Jiaxiang each added one higher primary school.

Educators in the disaster areas implemented the policy of education serving production for self-salvation in their work, cooperating with village cadres to carry out propaganda and education to the masses through winter schools, broadcasting, and blackboards, strengthening their confidence in production for self-salvation. Some teachers, in response to the erroneous idea of "simply relying on government relief," compiled teaching materials such as "Relying on Relief is Wrong" to explain in winter schools. Some teachers compiled the methods of production for self-salvation into "rhymes," encouraging the masses through students, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of the masses for production for self-salvation. In Zhaozheng Temple, a severely affected village in the fifth district of Wuji, Hebei, with the help of teachers, 136 out of 178 households engaged in sideline production, solving the problem of livelihood.

Teachers in the disaster areas have persisted in enduring hardship and sharing weal and woe with the masses. In many areas, teachers waded through water to conduct mobile teaching in various villages; some worked with the masses to build bridges and embankments; and even taught during the day and guarded the embankments at night. Teachers in the disaster areas generally lowered their salary standards, and some did not receive their salaries for several months, but still persisted in teaching. Teachers in the severely affected areas of Tianjin and Tangshan in Hebei Province mostly lived with the masses, eating what the masses ate; when the masses were hungry, the teachers were also hungry. This arduous style greatly increased the prestige of teachers among the masses, facilitating the development of work.

Organizing students for spare-time production is the most effective way to persist in education in disaster areas. Schools in disaster areas have mostly reduced the curriculum, only teaching Chinese and arithmetic, leaving students time for production; and the time for learning and production is stipulated. Teaching can be done whenever students are available; production is also organized and led by the school, working in groups, and discussing and inspecting at any time. Yuanlou Primary School in Yutai County, Pingyuan, arranged learning and production time alternately, organizing students to pick up manure, firewood, dig wild vegetables, and weave mats to help student families, and their studies have also improved, so the number of students has increased from more than 20 to 90. Six schools, including Qinghe River, Dakou, etc., in Hebei organized students to pick up firewood, sweep saltpeter soil, and leach saltpeter, increasing the number of students from 175 to 374.

In addition, the leading organs clarified the idea that education is a long-term undertaking and disaster is a short-term phenomenon, which also helped to preserve schools in the disaster areas. Education departments in various places are determined not to suspend or merge schools unless it is fundamentally impossible to maintain them; if they are suspended, teachers will be retained and assigned to work in other areas or sent to normal schools to study, so as to be ready to restore schools at any time.

At present, the education work in the disaster areas of the two provinces is still in serious difficulty; but based on past work experience, thousands of educators have greater confidence in persisting in education work in the disaster areas.

　　河北、平原灾区教育工作者结合生产救灾坚持教学
    保存了大部灾区学校，推动了生产渡荒工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】河北、平原两省灾区教育工作者结合生产救灾，坚持教学，保存大部分灾区学校，并对灾区生产渡荒起了推动作用。
    河北省去年有四分之一的土地被淹；平原省则几乎无县无灾。当时灾区学校受到严重的停办威胁，学生大为减少，家长都认为：“没吃没穿，孩子怎么念书。”部分教员也消极失望。后来因各级人民政府的正确领导，大部分教员坚持工作，教育群众生产自救，组织学生课余生产，得到群众拥护，灾区学校也得以保存。例如平原省的重灾区鱼台、嘉祥、南旺、梁山、寿张五县百分之七十九点一的小学都继续上课，梁山还增加了高小三处，鱼台、嘉祥也各增加高小一处。
    灾区教育工作者在工作中执行了教育为生产自救服务的方针，配合村干部，通过冬学、广播、黑板报，向群众进行宣传教育，坚定他们生产自救的信心。有的教员针对大家“单纯依赖政府救济”的错误思想，编成“依赖救济不应该”的教材在冬学讲解。有的教员把生产自救的办法编成“顺口溜”，通过学生鼓励群众，大大地提高了群众生产自救的情绪。河北无极五区重灾村赵正寺，经过教员的帮助，一七八户中有一三六户进行副业生产，解决了生活问题。
    灾区教员都坚持忍受困苦与群众共患难的作风。不少地区教员趟着水到各村巡回教学；有的和群众一块修桥、筑堤；甚至白天教学，夜晚看堤。灾区教员一般都降低了待遇标准，有的几月领不到薪金，仍然坚持教学。河北天津、唐山两专区的重灾区教员多跟群众一起生活，群众吃什么，教员吃什么；群众挨饿，教员也挨饿。这种艰苦的作风，大大提高了教员在群众中的威信，便利开展工作。
    组织学生课余生产，是坚持灾区教育最有效的办法。灾区学校多精减了课程，只上国文、算术，给学生留下生产的时间；并将学习与生产的时间都规定出来。教学可以随到随教；生产也由学校组织领导，分组工作，并随时讨论检查。平原鱼台县袁楼小学把学习与生产时间间隔排列，组织学生拾粪、拾柴、挖野菜、编席，帮助学生家庭，学习也有进步，因而学生从二十余人增加到九十人。河北青河流河、大兴口等六个学校把学生组织起来拾柴、扫硝土、淋硝，使学生由一七五人增加到三七四人。
    此外，领导机关明确了教育是长期事业、灾荒是短期现象的思想，也帮助灾区学校的保存。各地教育机关决心在不到根本无法维持时，绝不停办和合并学校；万一停办的，也将教员保留，分配到别的地区工作或送师范学习，以备随时恢复学校。
    现在，两省的灾区教育工作，仍然是在严重的困难之中；但根据过去的工作经验，成千的教育工作者对坚持灾区教育工作是有了更大的信心。
