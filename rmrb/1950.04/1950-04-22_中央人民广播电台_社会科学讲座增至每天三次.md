　　Central People's Broadcasting Station
    Social Science Lectures Increased to Three Times Daily
    [From Our Newspaper] In response to requests from listeners in various regions, the Central People's Broadcasting Station will, starting from the 24th of this month, add a rebroadcast of social science lectures from 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM daily. This means that lectures will be broadcast three times daily: the first time from 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM, the second time from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, and the third time from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The first broadcast will be a recording of the social science lecture from the previous evening, and the second broadcast will be a rebroadcast by the announcer. Since the station added the social science lectures on the 10th of this month, listeners have shown great enthusiasm for learning and generally believe that these lectures are very helpful for everyone's political studies. Up to now, 43 units, including organizations, troops, schools, and groups from various regions, have contacted the station. The smaller listening units have more than ten people, and the larger listening units have more than four hundred people. The Beijing Municipal First People's Cultural Center organized seventeen citizens to listen, and also organized four people who listen at home to participate in discussion groups. Many units are studying very seriously. For example, more than 50 cadres of the Huailai County Committee of the Communist Party of China listen on time, take notes, hold regular discussions, and stipulate that they will report their listening and learning situation to the Central People's Broadcasting Station once a month.
