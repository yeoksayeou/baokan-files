Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 29th -- To assist and organize disaster victims in production for self-relief, the Suxian Special District of northern Anhui Province has universally established native produce purchasing and marketing cooperatives and various production cooperative groups, extensively developing mass sideline production, which has played a significant role in overcoming the disaster. In order to resolutely implement the disaster relief policy of "primarily relying on production for self-relief, supplemented by social mutual assistance and government relief," the special district has vigorously organized sideline production since December of last year. However, at that time, farmers were generally lacking confidence due to concerns about a lack of raw material funds and difficulties in selling finished products. Therefore, the special district simultaneously organized production groups and extensively organized native produce purchasing and marketing cooperatives to assist and organize farmers in solving the problems of raw materials and product sales. Some funds were raised by the farmers themselves, and some were subsidized by the government. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office successively allocated 2 million catties of grain and 300 million RMB as funds for purchasing native products, and the Suxian Special District Office drew a large number of cadres to strengthen the work of cooperatives in various counties. The special district established a native produce purchasing general company, and each district and township also established cooperative organizations with a focus. For example, in Xiaoxian County, ten of the twelve districts and one hundred and sixty-one townships established cooperatives. The enthusiasm of farmers for sideline production was greatly improved, and various production cooperative groups were established one after another.

As of mid-February, statistics from the four counties of Suxian, Sihong, Xiaoxian, and Wuhe showed that a total of 8,831 sideline production cooperative groups for oil pressing, spinning, weaving, vermicelli making (grinding mung beans into flour to make vermicelli for consumption), weaving cover (for storing grain, woven from reeds into long strips), and weaving mats were organized, with more than 213,000 people participating in sideline production in an organized manner. The vast majority of finished products produced by all production groups were purchased by the cooperatives and sold to the outside. According to statistics from the Suxian County Cooperative, from the end of January to mid-March, the cooperative purchased 21,000 pairs of shoes, 20,000 catties of vermicelli, 20,000 mats, 4,000 covers, and 15,000 catties of sesame oil and soybean oil, and disaster-stricken farmers profited about 200,000 catties of grain. According to incomplete statistics from the entire special district, due to the organization of sideline production cooperation, coupled with other production income, the living problems of 500,000 disaster victims have been initially resolved.

In organizing and promoting disaster victims to engage in sideline production, the Xiaoxian County Cooperative established a native produce sales office in Xuzhou, which not only helped solve the problem of food and accommodation for disaster victims buying and selling goods, but also greatly reduced the exploitation of disaster victims by unscrupulous merchants through forced purchases, inaccurate scales, and heavy commissions. After the native products were sold, the sales office also helped to contact and bring back daily necessities for the disaster victims, and was therefore supported by the disaster victims.

At present, the native produce purchasing and marketing cooperatives and various production cooperative groups in the Suxian Special District are still continuing to develop. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office has recently allocated another 1 million catties of grain and 500 million RMB as a fund to more widely purchase and sell the finished products of disaster victims' sideline production, further promote the organization of sideline production, so as to shorten the spring famine and ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing and production.

　　扶助、组织灾民生产自救
    皖北宿县专区普遍建立产销合作组织
    现正领导缩短春荒进行春耕
    【新华社合肥二十九日电】皖北宿县专区普遍组织土产收购运销合作社和各种生产合作小组，广泛展开群众性的副业生产，对克服灾荒起了很大作用。该专区为坚决执行“以生产自救为主、社会互济和政府救济为辅”的救灾工作方针，自去年十二月起即大力组织副业生产，但当时农民顾虑缺乏原料资金和难于推销生产成品，普遍缺乏信心。因此该专区一面普遍组织生产小组，一面同时广泛组织土产的购运销合作社，以扶助与组织农民解决原料和产品销路问题。资金一部由农民自行筹集，一部由政府扶助。皖北行署曾先后拨粮二百万斤和人民币三亿元作收购土产资金，宿县专署则抽出大批干部加强了各县合作社的工作。专区成立土产收购总公司，各区乡亦有重点地建立合作社组织，如萧县十二个区中即有十个区、一百六十一个乡建立了合作社。农民副业生产的情绪因此大为提高，各种生产合作小组随之纷纷成立。
    截至二月中旬统计，宿县、泗洪、萧县、五河等四个县共计组织了榨油、纺纱、织布、拐粉（即将绿豆磨粉做成粉丝，供食用）、编折（供保存粮食之用，由芦苇杆子编成长条席状）、织席等副业生产合作小组八千八百三十一个，有二十一万三千余人有组织地投入了副业生产。所有生产小组出产的成品，绝大部分由合作社负责收购并向外推销。据宿县县合作社统计：从一月底至三月中旬，该社共收购鞋子二万一千双，粉丝二万斤，席子两万条，折子四千条，香油、豆油一万五千斤，灾区农民因此获利约二十余万斤粮。据全专区不完全统计，由于副业生产合作的组织，再加以其他生产收益，五十万灾民的生活问题已获初步解决。
    在组织推动灾民进行副业生产中，萧县合作社曾在徐州设立了土产推销处，不但帮助解决了买货销货的灾民的食宿问题，并大大减少了奸商对灾民强买、大秤、重佣等等剥削。在土产销出后，该推销处又帮助接洽带回灾民的生活必需品，因此得到灾民的拥护。
    目前宿县专区的土产收购运销合作社和各种生产合作小组仍在继续发展中。皖北行署近并又增拨粮食一百万斤和人民币五亿元作为基金，以便更广泛地收购和推销灾民副业生产的成品，进一步推动组织副业生产，以缩短春荒，使春耕生产得以顺利进行。
