　　Beijing Retail Company Third Business Office
    Extends Sales Hours: Enthusiastic Support from the Masses
    [Our Dispatch] The retail stores under the Third Business Office of Beijing Retail Company are distributed within the three inner districts, and the residents within the districts are mostly workers and laborers. In the past, sales were stopped and accounts settled before 5:30 PM every day, which was not very convenient for the needs of the grain-purchasing masses. Since the 20th of this month, the method has been changed. Each retail store still settles the accounts of the day at 5:00 PM, and the proceeds from sales after 5:00 PM are entered into the next day's accounts, extending business hours to 7:30 PM; if there are buyers of food grains and groceries before 8:00 AM the next day, before the listed price arrives, the prices are still based on yesterday's prices. According to residents near the Sixth Retail Store on Jiaodaokou South Street, the Eleventh Retail Store on Annei Street, and the Eighth Retail Store in Dongzhimen Xiaguan, this method is excellent, and it is even more supported by the working class whose wages are calculated on a daily basis. Especially the Eighth Store, because it is close to the countryside and the environment is special, selling grain for up to fourteen hours from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM, making it particularly convenient for rural production and river-digging masses.

　　京零售公司第三营业处
    延长售货时间  群众热烈拥护
    【本报讯】京市零售公司第三营业处所属各零售店，分布于内三区界，界内居民多为工人及劳苦大众。以往每日五时半以前，即停止售货，结算账目，对于购粮群众的需求，不够十分便利。自本月二十日起改订办法，各零售店每日仍于五时结算当日账目，而将五时后售出货款，走次日账，延长营业时间至七时半；次日八时前牌价尚未到来之时，如有购买食粮杂货者，仍按昨日牌价。据交道口南大街第六零售店、安内大街第十一零售店、东直门下关第八零售店附近居民反映，这一办法极好，一般以日计算工资收入的劳动工人，更为拥护，尤以第八店，因接近农村，环境特殊，每早六时至晚八时，售粮至十四小时，农村生产及挖河群众，尤觉便利。（受申）
