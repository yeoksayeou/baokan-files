    Congratulate Our Army on Landing on Hainan Island
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beijing continue to express their congratulations on the victory of the People's Liberation Army's cross-sea landing operation on Hainan Island. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, stated in his speech: "This is a great joyous event, a signal for the liberation of Taiwan!" "On behalf of the Democratic League, I extend my respects to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, all the commanders and fighters at the front, and the local armed forces of Hainan Island." He called on people from all walks of life to support the cause of completing the national liberation with the greatest strength. Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Democratic League, stated in his speech: "Hainan Island has a very important position in our national defense. Naval observers have always compared: 'Taiwan and Hainan Island are the two eyes of our southeast—Taiwan is the east eye, and Hainan Island is the south eye.' Now our army has successfully landed on the south eye, and the enemy in the east eye cannot exist for long." Huang Yanpei, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, stated in his speech: "The greatest significance of our army landing on Hainan Island is that it gives tremendous encouragement to the people of Taiwan and Qiongzhou in spirit, and at the same time poses a realistic threat to the Chiang bandits. I believe that countless compatriots on Taiwan and Qiongzhou Islands are sincerely leaning inward, but under the high pressure of the Chiang bandits, they can only wait for the 'opportunity' to act, and now the 'opportunity' is coming soon. We not only congratulate the compatriots of Hainan Island, but also congratulate the compatriots of Taiwan in advance." Fu Huating, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, also expressed his opinion: "Our army's landing on Hainan Island brought jubilation to people in the industry and commerce circles. The complete annihilation of the remaining bandits in Taiwan is not far off." A reader of this newspaper, Xing Qian, enthusiastically wrote in his letter to this newspaper: "The fact that our army successfully landed on Hainan Island proves that the People's Liberation Army is not only invincible on the mainland, but also invincible at sea. I feel honored and proud that we have such a heroic army." He said emotionally: "This news inspires my work enthusiasm. We who work in the rear must work hard to overcome difficulties, complete our respective production tasks, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China."

　　张澜黄炎培等
    庆贺我军登陆海南岛
    【本报讯】北京各界人士继续对人民解放军横跨大海登陆海南岛作战的胜利表示祝贺。民主同盟主席张澜发表谈话称：“这是莫大的喜事，这是解放台湾的信号。”“我谨代表民主同盟向毛主席、朱总司令和前方全体指战员暨海南岛地方人民武装致敬。”他号召各界人民以最大的力量来支援完成全国解放的事业。民主同盟副主席沈钧儒谈话略称：“海南岛在我国国防上有非常重要的地位。自来海军观察家譬喻：‘台湾和海南岛为我国东南两眼—台湾是东眼，海南岛为南眼’。现在我军胜利登陆南眼了，东眼的敌人自不可能长久存在了。”民主建国会常务委员黄炎培谈话略称：“我军登陆海南岛的最大意义，在精神上给台琼人民以莫大的鼓舞，同时给蒋匪以现实的威胁。我相信台琼两岛无数同胞，都在衷心地内向，但在蒋匪高压之下，只有待‘机’而动，现在‘机’快到了。我们不但为海南岛同胞祝贺，并为台湾同胞预贺。”北京市工商联合会筹委会主任傅华亭也发表意见称：“我军登陆海南岛，给工商界人士带来了狂欢，台湾残匪的彻底消灭为期不远了。”本报读者行前，在他寄给本报的信上热烈地写道：“我军胜利登陆海南岛的事实，证明着人民解放军不仅在大陆上是无敌的，而且在海洋上也是无敌的。我为着我们有这样英勇的军队而感到光荣与骄傲。”他感动地说：“这消息激励着我的工作热情，我们在后方工作的人们，要努力克服困难，完成各人所负的生产任务，支援人民解放军解放全中国。”
