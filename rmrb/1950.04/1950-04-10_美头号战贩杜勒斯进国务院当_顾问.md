Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to the U.S. Information Service, Truman appointed the notorious Republican foreign policy expert Dulles as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Acheson on the 6th. This is a reflection of the Truman administration suffering "the most devastating diplomatic failure in American history" (according to Republican Congressman Judd) in its diplomacy, especially in its China policy. The disastrous failure of the Truman administration's aggressive policy has caused frustration and dissatisfaction within the American ruling class. A quote from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, cited by the U.S. Information Service on February 7th, reflects this sentiment. The magazine stated, "The tough policy was originally intended to intimidate the Soviet Union, but it backfired," and "The atomic bomb has proven to be a bomb that won't explode when trying to intimidate the Soviet Union." In this frustrating situation, a group of Republican congressmen, such as Taft, Bridges, Nolan, McCarthy, etc., launched a fierce attack on the State Department, accusing it of being "pro-communist" and "occupied by communists," demanding a "purge" of the State Department, and even submitting a list of accusations, including Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and Owen Lattimore, who advocated cunning imperialist diplomacy. The flustered Truman administration, on the one hand, had Truman himself come forward to solemnly deny the accusations, and Acheson successively issued several statements and speeches defending his failures. On the other hand, it reiterated "bipartisan diplomacy," expressing its agreement to invite key Republicans to serve as foreign affairs "advisors." As early as January 4th of this year, the Associated Press issued a message stating that Vandenberg and Taft had agreed to "continue to cooperate with the Democratic Party" on foreign policy decisions, but "the Democratic Party should consult with the Republican Party in advance and allow the latter to participate in the formulation of decisions." Thus, after some clamor, the Truman administration apparently accepted this condition. Therefore, Vandenberg issued a statement on March 26th, expressing his support for the so-called "bipartisan diplomacy," while Truman appointed Dulles as Acheson's senior advisor on the 6th, asking him to "provide Acheson with advice on broad foreign affairs issues and the specific course of action that the U.S. government should follow." Two days prior (on the 4th), Truman also appointed another Republican, Cooper, as Acheson's foreign affairs advisor.

### 美头号战贩杜勒斯进国务院当“顾问”

　　美头号战贩杜勒斯进国务院当“顾问”
    【新华社九日讯】据美国新闻处讯，杜鲁门于六日委任臭名远扬的共和党外交政策专家杜勒斯为国务卿艾奇逊的高级顾问。这是杜鲁门政府在外交上特别是在对华政策上遭到“美国历史上最惨重的外交失败”（共和党众议员周以德语）的反映。杜鲁门政府侵略政策的惨败，引起了美国统治阶级内部的沮丧与不满。美国新闻处今年二月七日所引“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的话，反映了这种情绪。该杂志称：“强硬政策原来是恐吓苏联的，却打在自己脚上”，“原子弹到今天已证明是一颗在恐吓苏联时不会爆裂的炸弹”。在这种沮丧情况下，一批共和党议员如塔虎脱、勃里奇、诺兰、麦克锡等等对国务院发动了猛烈的攻击，责骂国务院“亲共”，“为共产党所盘踞”，要求“清洗”国务院，甚至提出检举名单，包括国务院无任所大使耶塞普及主张诡谲的帝国主义外交的拉铁摩尔在内。着了慌的杜鲁门政府，一方面以杜鲁门本人出面郑重否认，并由艾奇逊接连发表了几个辩解其失败的声明和演说，另一方面又重弹“两党一致外交”，表示同意邀请共和党要人担任外交“顾问”。早在今年一月四日，美联社就发过一个消息，说范登堡和塔虎脱已经商定在外交决策上“继续与民主党合作”，但要“民主党事先就商于共和党，并由后者参加制订决定”。这样，经过了一番吵嚷之后，杜鲁门政府显然接受了这个条件。于是，范登堡乃于三月二十六日发表一个声明，表示支持所谓“两党外交”，而杜鲁门则于六日委任杜勒斯出任艾奇逊的高级顾问，要他“就广泛的外交事务问题与美国政府所应奉行的具体行动方针，向艾奇逊提供意见”。在这前两日（四日），杜鲁门还委任了另一名共和党分子库泊尔为艾奇逊的外交顾问。
