Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Since the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued the resolution on establishing the Chinese Young Pioneers last October, incomplete statistics show that the number of members has reached 478,488, with urban primary school students accounting for the vast majority. Currently, the Young Pioneers have achieved initial success and experience in uniting and educating young people to study hard, abide by discipline, help and love each other, and develop healthy bodies and creative spirits.

In the past, the old liberated areas had Young Pioneers and Children's Corps organizations in rural areas. Cities like Harbin and Beijing, which were liberated earlier, also had similar organizations before the League Central Committee issued the resolution on establishing the Young Pioneers. After the resolution was issued, local League committees convened meetings of Young Pioneers workers to study the Central Committee's resolution and held forums and discussions in various places to implement the spirit of the resolution and begin the work of establishing and transferring teams. During the establishment of the teams, various localities corrected the incorrect perception of some teachers that the team was led by the League and non-League members could ignore it, as well as the concerns of some children who were afraid of criticism and self-criticism. In addition, home visits and forums were used to explain the significance of establishing the team to the children's parents, dispelling some parents' misunderstandings that children would join the army or join the army in the future and would not be able to help with work at home. After extensive publicity, children asked to join the team one after another. More than half of the children in one class of the Girls' Normal School Affiliated Primary School in Xi'an wrote their wishes to join the team in their diaries. A parent in Nanjing who did not allow their child to join the team in the past now brought their child to the school to request approval to join the team. Some teachers said: "With the team, it is easier to teach students!"

The activities of the Chinese Young Pioneers are diverse. Some areas have created many activities suitable for children's physical and mental characteristics in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's resolution on establishing the team.

In assisting regular class studies, the Harbin Young Pioneers used methods such as catching misspelled words to improve children's attention to misspelled words; in their spare time, they held lectures to explain "celestial bodies," guiding children's mysterious feelings about the universe toward scientific understanding; during vacations, they organized children to collect specimens for instance teaching in class.

In terms of ideological education, the Beijing Young Pioneers organized children to visit the Forbidden City, where teachers explained the origin of the Forbidden City, explaining that it was the crystallization of the working people's blood and sweat, and enhanced children's respect for labor. The Harbin Young Pioneers launched children to visit Soviet primary schools and have a get-together with Soviet children. In many places, the Young Pioneers instructors told children stories of revolutionary heroes and led children to visit scenic spots and historical sites, and watch films that were educational for children. These have strengthened the children's understanding of patriotism and internationalism.

In order to cultivate children's healthy physique and lively and cheerful spirit, various places have organized activities such as travel, games, dancing, singing, and sports activities and physical labor suitable for children's physical strength.

After the establishment of the Young Pioneers, it has achieved four significant results.

After the establishment of the Young Pioneers, it has achieved significant results in the following aspects:

One, improved academic performance. For example, in the history exam of the central primary school in the fourth district of Beijing, all 38 members of one squadron scored above 90 points. Members are generally able to actively help others. For example, 11 students in the 7th Complete Primary School in Shijiazhuang had an average of 47 points in Chinese and 30 points in arithmetic, which was improved to 83 to 90 points with the help of the members.

Two, improved learning order. Children who did not follow the rules before gradually abided by the rules under the influence of the members, and naughty children and even children with stealing behavior gradually changed. For example, before the establishment of the team in the central primary school in the fourth district of Beijing, the number of people who were late for class once reached 30% to 40%. After the establishment of the team, the number of late arrivals often did not exceed ten.

Three, strengthened the children's unity and mutual assistance. Originally, many classmates in the Subotai Normal School Affiliated Primary School did not speak to each other when they met. After the team was established, they all became friendly and close. Yin Xiangxiang, a member of Beijing No. 8 Middle School for Boys, risked his life to save a child who had accidentally fallen into an ice cave in the severe winter last year.

Four, guiding children to participate in labor and social service work has enhanced children's concepts of labor and social service. Beijing, Jilin, Zhangjiakou, Haimen, Changsha and other places have literacy classes run by children. Older children in Beijing have actively participated in the construction of Tiananmen Square.

However, some Young Pioneers workers in some areas have some shortcomings in their work because they do not have a good understanding of the spirit of the resolution on establishing the team and the characteristics of children. For example, the requirements for recruiting members are too high; after joining the team, children are inappropriately required to play an exemplary leading role; and inappropriate methods such as politicization and adultification are used to educate and manage children. Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of Young Pioneers work cadres to summarize the experience of the past six months and to improve the work of the Young Pioneers from the current basis.

　　中国少年儿童队发展迅速
    队员已达四十七万八千人
    在团结教育工作各方面获初步经验
    【新华社十八日讯】自去年十月青年团中央发布关于建立中国少年儿童队的决议以来，至现在为止，据不完全的统计，队员人数已达四十七万八千四百八十八人，其中以城市小学生占绝大多数。现少年儿童队在团结和教育少年儿童努力学习，遵守纪律，互助互爱，及养成健康体魄和创造精神等方面已获得了初步的成绩和经验。
    过去老解放区农村曾有少年先锋队以及儿童团的组织，解放较早的城市哈尔滨和北京等在团中央发布建队决议前也有类似的组织。建队决议发布后，各地团委即召开了少年儿童工作者会议，研究团中央决议，并在各地召开座谈会、讨论会，贯彻决议的精神，开始建队转队工作。建队中，各地曾纠正了部分教师认为队由团领导自己是非团员可以不管的不正确认识，以及部分儿童怕批评检讨等顾虑。此外，并采用家庭访问、座谈会等方式向儿童家长解释建队的意义，消除了一些家长怕儿童参军或将来参军，不能帮助家里干活等误解。经过广泛宣传后，儿童们纷纷要求入队，西安市女师附小一班半数以上儿童在日记上写着入队愿望，南京市某家长过去不让孩子入队，现在则带着孩子到学校要求批准入队。有的教师说：“有了队，学生也好教了！”
    少年儿童队的活动是多种多样的，有些地区已创造了不少适合儿童身心特点的活动方式。
    中国少年儿童队的活动是多种多样的。有些地区已根据团中央关于建队决议的精神，创造了不少适合儿童身心特点的活动方式。
    在辅助正课学习方面，哈尔滨少年儿童队用抓错字、别字游戏的方法，提高儿童对错字、别字的注意；在课余则举办讲座，讲解“天体”等，把儿童对于宇宙的神秘感觉引向科学的认识；在假期中组织儿童采集标本，以便在课内进行实例教学。
    在思想教育方面，北京少年儿童队组织儿童参观故宫，由教员讲解故宫的来历，说明它是劳动人民血汗的结晶，提高儿童对劳动的尊重。哈尔滨少年儿童队发动儿童参观苏联小学，和苏联儿童联欢。许多地方少年儿童队的辅导员都为儿童讲革命伟人的故事，领导儿童参观名胜古迹，看对儿童有教育意义的影片等。这些都加强了儿童们的爱国主义和国际主义的认识。
    为培养儿童健全的体魄和活泼愉快的精神，各地都组织了旅行、游戏、舞蹈、歌咏等活动，和适合于儿童体力的体育活动和体力劳动。
    少年儿童队建立后，已获得四点显著成绩。
    少年儿童队建立之后，已在以下各方面获得显著成绩：
    一、提高了学习成绩，如北京四区中心小学历史考试中，一个中队三十八个队员全部考九十分以上。队员一般都能积极帮助别人。如石家庄第七完全小学有十一个学生国语平均四十七分，算术三十分，经队员帮助提高到八十三分至九十分。
    二、改善了学习秩序。以前不守规则的儿童在队员影响下渐守秩序，顽皮儿童以至有偷窃行为的儿童也逐渐转变。如北京四区中心小学建队前上课迟到人数一度达百分之三十至四十，建队后，迟到的常不超过十人。
    三、加强了儿童们的团结互助。苏北师范附小原来有很多同学见面不讲话，建队后，都和好亲密了。北京男八中队员尹相乡曾在去年冬天严寒中奋不顾身地救出一个失足跌入冰洞的孩子。
    四、引导儿童参加劳动和社会服务工作，提高了儿童劳动和社会服务的观念。北京、吉林、张家口、海门、长沙等都有儿童办的识字班，北京年龄较大的儿童曾积极参加天安门广场的修建工作。
    但也有些地区的少年儿童队工作者因为对建队决议的精神和对儿童的特点体会不够，工作中曾产生一些缺点。例如吸收队员条件过高；入队后不适当地要儿童起模范带头作用；并用政治化、成人化等不适当的方式去教育和管理儿童。最近团中央召集了少年儿童工作干部会议，将总结过去半年来的经验，使少年儿童队的工作从现在基础上提高一步。
