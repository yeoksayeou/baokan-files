Ren Qianhu Bravely Battles the Famine
    By our reporter Li Wen

    Decades of unprecedented flooding
    During the years when the Japanese devils and the "Kuomintang" were wreaking havoc on the people, riverbanks and dikes were only destroyed, never repaired. Last summer, we experienced seven consecutive torrential rains, and the Jiyun River burst its banks, flooding over a thousand villages in several counties along the river. When the flooding first started, the People's Government and the Communist Party led the people in building embankments and repairing dams to fight the floods. Unfortunately, the continuous rain made the water level rise incessantly, and the dikes had been neglected for many years, eventually causing them to break. On the sixteenth day of the sixth lunar month, the floodwaters surrounded Ren Qianhu Village in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, with two feet of water in the gardens at the edge of the village, making it possible to travel by boat from the doorstep. Looking at the vast expanse of water, every household sighed. Some said, "The wheat harvest is lost, and every family has no surplus grain, and no side jobs. How are people going to survive?" Some clamored to kill pigs and livestock, saying, "We're not going to make it anyway, might as well eat a good meal and die." Gray-haired old men stood at the village entrance and sighed, "I've lived to be seventy or eighty years old, but I've never seen such a great flood!"

    Cadres and Party members lead the masses in fighting the disaster
    While everyone was worried about the flood, Ren Zhan'ao, the Communist Party branch secretary of the village (who was then the village head and later the chairman of the village representative meeting), and Liu Jinxiang (a Party member), a member of the village administrative committee, had other things on their minds. Liu Jinxiang was a carpenter and could support his family by doing work in other villages, but he was a village cadre, so could he just leave everyone and run away? After the flood came, Ren Zhan'ao went to Tianjin once, and a relative advised Zhan'ao not to suffer in the village and said he could help Zhan'ao find a job. At first, Zhan'ao was somewhat tempted, but another thought made him undecided. After returning home, he was even more troubled: "In good times, I lead everyone in their work, and as a cadre, I am respected by everyone. But when times change, and everyone is in trouble, I run away first..." Zhan'ao tossed and turned at night, unable to sleep, and finally made up his mind: to stay and lead the masses through the famine.

    Ren Zhan'ao first discussed the matter with several village branch committee members and then convened a general meeting of all Party members in the village. First, they studied the reactions of the masses and then proposed, "Just worrying won't fill our stomachs, and we won't survive if this goes on for too long. Can we think of a solution?" The Party members were silent. Zhan'ao said, "We are in difficulty now, but how does it compare to the past? When the Japanese devils and the traitor troops raided, we didn't dare sleep at home and crawled out from under the bullets. When the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked the year before last, they were fierce. In the end, didn't we win?" A branch committee member interjected, "We are in difficulty, but when Chairman Mao led the Red Army on the Long March of 25,000 miles, they ate their belts - they even ate their horses. Wasn't that difficult!" Liu Jinxiang squatted on the side, frowning and saying nothing. Suddenly, he stood up and said, "I know how to do carpentry, and escaping the famine and taking care of my family wouldn't be too difficult. However, I am a Communist Party member, and I want to be with my elders and fellow villagers to overcome the disaster. I will definitely not leave." "That's right! We will definitely not leave and will share the guilt and blessings with all the elders and fellow villagers." Putting an end to the various ideas, the Party members became more determined.

    The Party members also specifically studied disaster relief measures: more than a mile south of the village, next to the farm (which the Japanese devils had forcibly purchased 50,000 mu of land to build, and which was later taken over by the People's Government), there was wasteland and "wild bran seeds" (a kind of edible grass seed). With these two things, people wouldn't starve to death. They also discussed the work that each Party member should do: the men would mobilize the men, and the women would persuade the women. Each Party member should take action first and lead the neighbors around them to the farm.

    The next day, a general meeting of the villagers was convened. Ren Zhan'ao said, "Although the flood is great, we don't need to be afraid because we have the means to overcome the famine. We have already sent people to the farm to check, and there is little water inside the farm's embankment (there is a large embankment around the farm), so we can immediately harvest firewood and grass, and we can also gather white seeds. "The best grain is wheat, and the best wild grain is white seeds." With white seeds, we can survive." He announced to the masses, "All of us village cadres will not leave and are determined to lead our elders and fellow villagers through the disaster. We can only die before our elders and fellow villagers, not after them." Ren Zhan'ao's sincere expression and determination moved many people! Discussions began in the crowd. Ren Lianfu said, "We can't just be dazed anymore. Oil cakes won't fall from the sky. We can only avoid starvation if we are willing to take action." The deputy village head (female) and the director of the women's association said, "We women cadres will definitely lead everyone to gather white seeds. If someone is afraid of wading through the water, we have two small boats in the village to send the women to the embankment, where the water is shallow."

    On the first day, male and female Party members and activists led a group of people to the farm. As dusk fell, the men waded through the water, dragging dozens of bundles of firewood home, and those gathering white seeds could gather four or five liters. People's confidence increased, and the number of people increased from fifty or sixty to over a hundred the next day. Small boats sent the women to the embankment, and some women hesitated to get into the water because the water depth inside the embankment varied. Female Party member Zhang Wenting said, "We women don't need to be timid when wading through the water. I'll try it first." She waded ahead, and more than twenty women and children followed her to gather white seeds. Ren Lianfu mobilized more than twenty people in the middle street to collect firewood. In order to reduce the amount of water everyone had to wade through, he borrowed a small boat from relatives in other villages. More and more people collected firewood and gathered white seeds every day, and Pang Guiying, who was pregnant and carrying a child, also went to the farm.

    Who wouldn't want to work to survive? It's just that when the flood came, people were temporarily "confused." When everyone was busy collecting firewood and gathering white seeds, the hardworking people "steadied" their hearts.

    Relying on the water, developing fish production
    As the water receded, Ren Zhan'ao went to the farm to contract for work. As he waded through the water near the embankment, he saw fish in the water. Zhan'ao was happy: "People in water towns can manage fish, why can't we learn to manage fish?" He returned to the village and held a meeting of the branch committee and Party members. Su Wanzhi, a female Party member, had 1,000 jin of reeds prepared for building a house and was willing to lend them to everyone to weave fish traps. This boosted everyone's spirits. But they still had to raise money to buy nets and hemp. Everyone agreed to hold a village-wide meeting to ask the masses to think of ways to solve the difficulty of buying nets. They also specifically studied having each person contribute four jin of sorghum as one share, and after the fish were harvested, dividends would be distributed according to the shares.

    The cadres and Party members were enthusiastic about planning for the masses and raising money to manage fish, which made the masses very satisfied. At the meeting, they immediately registered 92 shares. The next day, after an announcement over the loudspeaker, 368 jin of sorghum were quickly delivered. Yu Ruiqing, who knew how to weave traps, became a respected person. More than forty men and women surrounded her learning how to weave traps, and the children gathered on the side, busy peeling reeds.

    The water had receded, revealing the edge of the embankment. The village cadres led everyone to build the embankment, and people saw fish flipping in the water, so they built the embankment with extra energy! In less than half a day, they built an embankment more than two miles long and placed traps and nets in it. People waited quietly to hear good news. A day passed, and two days passed, and they caught a total of 20 jin of fish. Hope was dashed by a bucket of cold water, and some people were worried, and some people began to complain: "Squeezing oil from bran, we really can't afford to lose this little bit of capital!" Ren Zhan'ao was even more restless, but he appeared very calm and comforted everyone: "Elders and fellow villagers, don't be discouraged, wait and see!"

    Ren Zhan'ao attended a joint meeting of village branch secretaries in the district. The district committee was holding a meeting to study how to deal with the disaster, and the main message was: "Don't be intimidated by the water, learn to profit from the water." Zhan'ao reported the situation in the village to the district committee, and the district committee encouraged Zhan'ao: "Don't be discouraged, be firm, there may not be fish every day. There are no fish now, maybe the water is too high and the fish are not leaving, not going into the nets." Ren Zhan'ao returned to the village, still worried, so he, Ren Dengge, and Liu Jinxiang waded through the water to inspect the area. When they reached the embankment, the three were happy. Most of the water in the farm had receded, and the traces of the six roads were about to appear above the water. The shallow water was warm, and the fish swam from the shallow water to the ditches on both sides of the road, which was a convenient time to catch fish. The three dared not linger and immediately returned to the village to call for people. Following the terrain of the roads and ditches, they built several embankments. After blocking for a whole day, they opened the embankment openings, and the white fish rolled down with the water, sieve after sieve, so much that they couldn't pick them up fast enough. Two small boats were busy transporting them home, and that day they caught 1,200 jin of fish. The whole village was like it was celebrating a great happy event. The news of the fish excited every man and woman, and those gathering firewood also put in extra effort. Usually, each person would gather seventy or eighty jin a day, but that day many people gathered more than a hundred jin.

    People were happy to see the jumping fish, but village head Ren Zhan'ao thought of an important task. He immediately convened a meeting of village cadres to study the division of labor: Ren Zhan'ao and Ren Guihong led everyone in distributing fish and replenishing the tools and materials used for managing fish at any time. Ren Zhanting and Zhang Zhengfang were responsible for selling the fish, Ren Dengge patrolled the water and fish conditions back and forth, and Liu Jinxiang was responsible for guarding the fish stall. Then they mobilized the masses to organize six mutual aid groups for managing fish and collecting firewood according to the six roads and twelve ditches. Each group left four people to watch the ditches and catch fish, one person to transport the fish to the village, and the rest went to collect firewood.

    For more than ten days in a row, they caught more than a thousand to two thousand jin of fish every day. People were busy with both managing fish and collecting firewood, and the atmosphere of intense production stirred the entire Ren Qianhu.

    Actively exploring production avenues
    By the end of the eighth lunar month, the water had receded and there were fewer fish, and managing fish was no longer very "profitable."

    The farm needed to build tile houses, and there were tile-roofing craftsmen in Ninghe Town, so they invited the craftsmen there. Ren Qianhu provided labor to jointly contract the construction of the farm's work. The two sides negotiated a dividend sharing plan, and they contracted with the farm to build twelve tile houses in two phases, working for a total of fourteen days. Whoever was in the most difficulty would go, and each day they could solve the "work" for twenty-eight laborers. Each laborer could earn eight jin of corn per day, which could then be exchanged for bran to feed the family.

    People were so busy with their hands that they didn't even have time to talk, let alone have the energy to raise livestock. Some people were considering selling their livestock again. Ren Zhan'ao led the branch in holding a meeting to discuss that they couldn't just mobilize the masses not to sell their livestock, they had to find a way to raise livestock. They also calculated that the farm needed a large number of bricks and tiles to build, so they contracted with the farm to purchase 40,000 bricks and 100,000 tiles. They bought bricks and tiles from Ninghe Town and transported them to the farm, thirty miles away. This gave the "idle livestock" a "place to use," and twenty or thirty carts a day were active on the road. Each livestock and cart could earn 16 to 20 jin of corn per day. After being active for a month, the livestock had fodder to eat, gradually became "strong," and also took care of its owner.

    Learning skills to overcome the winter famine
    What the masses of Ren Qianhu remember most is the heavy snow on the twenty-fourth day of the tenth lunar month last winter. This snow was even more ruthless than the flood.

    The flood drowned the autumn crops, but there was firewood and grass to burn and to feed the livestock, and it could be exchanged for bran in the city, so people wouldn't starve. Who would have thought that half a foot of snow would block the door, and people would complain: "This snow has fallen at a critical time, we can't collect firewood, we have nothing to burn and nothing to eat, and we're freezing to death."

    The tenacious Ren Qianhu still did not bow to the "desperate year." With the help of the district committee and the district government, they actively explored the production avenues of weaving straw bags.

    They borrowed ten straw bag machines from the district, and the district committee helped them pre-borrow 2,000 jin of rice straw from Ma'anzi, a lightly disaster-stricken village. No one in the village knew how to weave, so they sent Ren Dengge and Zhang Yongfang to Huangguzhuang to learn the technology. They also discovered that Zhang Deyu's wife had woven straw bags in her mother's home, so she became the village's teacher, and more than forty men and women followed her to learn how to weave straw bags. For six or seven days in a row, more than a thousand jin of rice straw were consumed, and some machines were also broken, but no straw bags were woven, and many people were discouraged and stopped doing it. The branch held a meeting to study the reasons for the failure: too many people and too much confusion, lack of good organization. For the second technical training, they selected twenty people who were skilled and clever and key village cadres and Party members and assigned them to be responsible for the custody of the machines and studied and learned attentively. In order to make them study with peace of mind, the village temporarily borrowed bran for them to eat. Ren Lianfu found a broken straw bag left by the Japanese devils, dismantled it, and studied how it was woven, and finally improved his skills, increasing from weaving one or two a day to three or four, and the faster ones to five or six. The amount of straw consumed per straw bag was reduced from 15 jin to 8 or 9 jin. In ten days, they wove 150 straw bags, and each straw bag could earn a net profit of two jin of rice. This aroused the masses' interest in weaving straw bags, and many people asked to learn how to weave. The branch saw that "the time had come" and called on every Party member, activist, and masses who were willing to weave straw bags to freely form groups to teach apprentices while weaving. They led to the district three more times to get straw bag machines. Those who wanted to learn watched attentively as others weaved on the machines. As soon as they got the machines, many people could immediately start using them. The whole village went from having no foundation to having 44 straw bag machines and 11 straw rope machines, and 48 of the village's 131 households learned to weave straw bags.

    The tenth and twelfth lunar months have already passed. Now, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of Ren Qianhu have basically completed spring plowing and sowing in conjunction with sideline production.

　　任千户英勇战灾荒
    本报记者  力文
    几十年没有的大水
    在日本鬼子和“刮民党”祸害老百姓的年月里，江河堤岸只见破坏，不见修理。碰到去年夏天连下七场涝雨，蓟运河决口了，淹没了沿岸数县千余个村庄。刚发水的时候，人民政府和共产党就领导老百姓打埝修坝，和洪水作战；无奈阴雨连绵，水势有增无已，堤岸又多年失修，终于是决了口子。旧历六月十六，大水围住了河北省宁河县任千户，村头园地上有二尺深水，出门便可行船。望着一片汪洋，家家户户长吁短叹。有的说：“麦季没收，家家无积粮，又没副业，这叫人怎么过呢？”有人嚷着要杀猪杀牲口，说：早晚活不成，吃上一顿死了得啦。白发苍苍的老汉们，站在村头长叹一声：“活到七八十岁不算少，没有过这样大的水灾啊！”
    干部党员领导群众向灾荒斗争
    人人望着水发愁，该村中共支部书记任占鳌（当时在村中任村长后来是村代表会主席）、村行政委员刘晋祥（党员）另外多一番心事。刘晋祥会做木匠活，到外乡做活，能使一家糊口，但自己是村干部，能不能不管大家一溜跑开呢？大水来后，任占鳌到过一次天津，有位亲戚劝占鳌不要在村里受罪了，他可以帮占鳌找个工作。开初占鳌有些动心，另一种思想却使他拿不定主意，回家后反而心中更烦乱了：“好年好景领着大伙干工作，当干部，人人尊敬；年景一变，大伙作难了，自己先溜走……”占鳌晚上翻来复去的睡不着，到底下定了决心：留下来领导群众渡荒。
    任占鳌先跟几个村支部委员酝酿了一番，便召开了全村党员大会，先研究了群众有啥反映，遂提出来：“光发愁不顶吃喝，时间长了也活不成，是不是能想个办法呢？”党员们默不作声。占鳌说：“如今咱们困难，比比过去呢？鬼子汉奸队来突击，咱不敢在家睡觉，从枪子儿底下爬出来。前年国民党反动派进攻，气势凶凶。最后还不是咱们胜利了？”一个支委插了一嘴：“咱困难，毛主席领着红军长征两万五，皮带吃了——马也杀吃了，那困难不困难啊！”刘晋祥蹲在一边，皱着眉头不吭声，忽然他站起来说话了：“我会耍手艺，逃荒在外，顾一家人不是多难。可是，我是共产党员，我要和父老们在一起渡灾荒，我一定不走。”“对！咱们一定不走，和全村父老有罪同受，有福同享。”结束了各种不同的想法，党员们更坚定起来了。
    党员们又具体研究了救灾办法：村南一里多地紧靠农场（鬼子在时强购民地五万亩筑成的，后为人民政府接收），场里有荒草，有“野粕子”（一种能吃的草籽），有了这两样，人便饿不死。并讨论了每个党员要做的工作：男的动员男的，女的说服妇女。每个党员要首先动弹起来，并要带动周围邻居下农场。
    第二天全村群众大会召开了，任占鳌讲话：“水灾虽大，咱们用不着怕，咱们有条件渡荒。我们已派人到农场查看了，农场埝里边水少（围着农场一圈有个大埝），马上可以涝柴草，还可以掠白籽。“家粮最好是麦子，野粮最好是白籽”，有了白籽就能活。”他向群众宣布：“我们全体村干部一个不走，决心领导父老们渡过灾荒。我们只能死在父老们以前，不死在父老们以后。”任占鳌恳切的神情和决心，不少人被感动了！人群中开始了议论。任连富说：“不能再模糊了，两眼呆着，天上也掉不下油饼，肯动弹才饿不死。”副村长（女）、妇会主任表示：“我们女干部一定领着大伙掠白籽，有人怕趟水，咱村有两只小船把妇女送到大埝上，埝里边水就浅了。”
    开始一天，男女党员、积极分子领着一批人下农场了。傍黑天，男人们趟着水，拖着几十捆柴回家了，掠白籽的能掠四五升。人们的信心增强了，第二天便由五六十人增到百多人。小船把妇女们送到大埝上，有些妇女看着埝里边的水，深浅不一，犹疑着不敢下水。女党员张文亭说：“咱妇女趟水用不着‘缩’，我先下去试试。”她在前面趟，二十多个妇女、小孩跟着她掠白籽。任连富动员中街二十多人去捞柴，为着使大伙少趟水，还到外村亲戚家借了个小船。捞柴掠白籽的一天比一天多了，庞桂英怀着孕，背着小孩也下农场了。
    为着自己活下去，谁还不愿干活呢？只是大水发来，人们一时“头蒙”了。当大家捞柴、掠白籽忙起来的时候，勤劳的人们便“稳”住心了。
    靠水吃水，治鱼生产
    水势开始下退，任占鳌去农场包工，当他趟水趟到大埝附近时，看见水里有鱼。占鳌乐了：“人家水乡能治鱼，咱为啥不能学治鱼。”回村开支委会和党员大会研究，女党员苏万之家有一千斤准备盖房子的苇子，愿先借给大伙织捉鱼用的箔，这一来大家的劲起来了。但是还得筹钱买网和麻呢，大家同意，开全村大会让群众想办法，解决买网的困难。并具体研究了每人出四斤高粱算为一股，出鱼后，按股分红。
    干部、党员们热心为群众打算，筹钱治鱼，群众很满意，在大会上当场便登记了九十二股。第二天广播筒一吆唤，三百六十八斤高粱很快便送齐了。会织箔的于瑞青成为大伙尊敬的人了，四十多个男女围着她学织箔，孩子们凑在一边忙着剥苇子。
    水已退得露出埝边来了，村干部们领着大伙去打埝，人们看见鱼在水中翻花，埝打的格外起劲！不到一晌工夫，便打了二里多长的一道埝，下上了箔和网。人们静等着听好消息，一天过去了，两天过去了，共捉了二十斤鱼。希望被一瓢冷水泼下去，有些人在耽心；有些人开始埋怨了：“谷糠里挤油，咱们这点本钱可真赔不得啊！”任占鳌更是坐卧不安，却表示很镇静地安慰着大家：“父老们不要灰心，等等看吧！”
    任占鳌到区里参加村支部书记联席会，区委开会正是研究如何救灾，主要精神是：“不要被水吓倒，要学会水中取利。”占鳌把村中情况反映给区委，区委鼓励占鳌：“不要灰心，要坚定，不一定每天都有鱼。现下没鱼，可能是水大鱼不走，不上网。”任占鳌回到村里，仍放心不下，他就和任登阁、刘晋祥，三个人趟着水四处巡看。当登上大埝时，三个人都乐了，农场里的水大部泄退，六条马路的土迹快露出水面了。浅水地方热，鱼儿从浅水纷纷游向马路两旁的沟里，正是捉鱼方便的时候。三个人不敢停留，马上回村叫人，顺着马路、水沟的地形，打好了几道埝。整整蹩了一天，决开埝口，白哗哗的鱼随着水往下滚，一筛子又一筛子，挑也挑不及了，两只小船紧忙往家运，这一天出鱼一千二百多斤。全村像逢了大喜事。出鱼的消息激动每个男女，拾柴的人也格外加劲了，平素每人一天拾七八十斤，这天许多人拾到百多斤。
    人们看着蹦跳的鱼发乐，村长任占鳌却想起了一件重要工作。他马上召开村干部会研究分工：任占鳌、任贵洪领着大伙分鱼，随时补给治鱼用的工具、材料；任占庭、张正芳负责鱼的推销，任登阁往返巡查水情鱼情，刘晋祥负责看鱼铺。然后又发动群众按照六条马路，十二条水沟，组合了六个治鱼拾柴的互助组；每组留四个人看沟捉鱼，一个人往村中运鱼，其余的人全部去拾柴。
    连着十多天，每天出千多斤到二千斤鱼。人们是治鱼、拾柴两头忙，紧张生产的空气激荡着整个任千户。
    主动开辟生产门路
    到旧历八月底，水落鱼少，治鱼已没有大“油水”了。
    农场要修建瓦房，宁河镇有盖瓦房的匠人，到那里把匠人请来，任千户出劳力，合作包建农场的工。双方商量好分红办法，前后两次向农场订立了修建十二间瓦房的合同，共动工十四天。谁最困难谁去，每天可解决二十八个劳力的“活计”。一个劳力每天挣八斤玉米，再换成麸糠，养活一家人吃喝不成问题。
    人们两手紧干还顾不上嘴，那有余力养牲口呢？有些人又在酝酿卖牲口了。任占鳌领导支部开会商议，不能只动员群众不卖牲口，必须想出养牲口的办法。他们又计算到农场身上了，修建农场需大量用砖瓦，他们前后和农场商订了代购四万砖、十万瓦的合同。他们从宁河镇收买砖瓦，三十里地运到农场，这一来“闲牲口”有了“用武之地”了，每天二、三十辆大车活动在公路上。一个牲口，一辆大车，每天可挣脚费十六斤到二十斤玉米。连着活动了一个月，牲口有草料喂，渐渐“硬气”了，也顾全了它的东家。
    学会技术渡冬荒
    任千户群众印象最深的是去冬旧历十月二十四日的一场大雪，这场雪比大水更无情。
    大水淹了秋庄稼，有柴草还有烧的，有喂牲口的，并且可以到城里换回麸糠，便饿不倒人。谁料想尺半深大雪壅门，人们又纷纷叫苦：“这场雪下到节骨眼上了，柴也拾不来，烧没烧吃没吃，冻也冻死了。”
    顽强的任千户依然没有向“绝年”低头，在区委、区政府帮助下，又积极开辟织草袋的生产门路。
    从区里贷到十架草袋机，区委又帮助他们从轻灾村马庵子预借到二千斤稻草。本村无人会织，派任登阁、张永芳去黄沽庄学技术。又发现张德玉的老婆在娘家织过草袋，便成了村中的老师，四十多个男女跟她学织草袋。一连六七天，稻草消耗了千多斤，有的机器也弄坏了，草袋却未织成，不少人灰心不干了。支部开会研究，失败的原因是：人多手乱，缺乏很好的组织。二次组织学习技术，挑选手巧心灵的人和主要村干、党员共二十个人，并把机器分给专人负责保管，用心研究学习；为着他们学习安心，又由村中暂借麸子供他们吃用。任连富找了个鬼子留下的破草袋，一面拆开，一面研究人家怎样织的，终于提高了技术，由每天织一两个，提高到三四个，手快的织到五六个。由一个草袋消耗十五斤草节省到八九斤草。前后十天织成了一百五十个草袋，每个草袋能净赚二斤米。这引起群众对织草袋的兴趣，不少人又要求学织了，支部看着“时候到了”，号召每个党员、积极分子，和愿织草袋的群众，自由结组带徒弟，一面织一面教。连着又到区领了三次草袋机，想学的人用心看着别人在机子上织，机子领到手，不少人马上能上机子了。全村由毫无基础发展到四十四架草袋机，十一架草绳机，全村一百三十一户有四十八户学会了织草袋。
    十冬腊月已经熬过去了。现在任千户的老百姓在党和人民政府领导下，结合着副业生产，已大体完成了春耕播种。
