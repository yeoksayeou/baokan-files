Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: The financial work in the Northeast region has implemented several significant measures over the past year, leading to increasingly stable and improved financial and economic conditions throughout the region. This represents a major transformation in finance under the circumstances where the entire Northeast has been liberated and economic construction has become the overriding central task. This transformation has enabled the restoration and development of economic construction in the Northeast at an unprecedented scale and speed. This transformation process has been achieved through arduous efforts.

	First, how to shift the financial work from a decentralized state to a centralized and unified one was an urgent problem to be solved at that time. In the past, due to the enemy's division of the region, each province acted independently with little contact with each other. The first step in implementing centralization and unification was to unify policies, guidelines, plans, and systems. For example, a unified "Regulations on the Collection of Public Grain in the Entire Northeast," "Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Income Tax," "Regulations on Village Financial Management," and "Urban Financial Construction Plan" were formulated; a monthly physical and cash revenue and expenditure plan was established, and a strict revenue and expenditure system was established, with reports on tax revenue, grain, and monopoly operations submitted every ten days and monthly; a management and inspection system for all warehouses, treasuries, and granaries was established, stipulating that the transfer and receipt of grain, clothing, materials, and cash must be handled according to the system. In order to increase national fiscal revenue and limit unwarranted consumption, the production and sales management of tobacco and alcohol (i.e., tobacco and alcohol monopoly) was implemented starting in late February of last year. The General Accounting Bureau was established in mid-March to uniformly manage the funds of all state-owned enterprises, including industrial and mining, forestry, postal and telecommunications, railways, shipping, trade, and banking. Cash management was implemented from April, with all cash revenue of government agencies and public enterprises deposited in the Northeast Bank. Necessary cash expenditures were allocated by the Northeast Bank according to the approved plan. The General Accounting Bureau, in cooperation with relevant departments, also conducted a cleanup of state and local property, enabling unified management of state assets. At the end of last year, after the asset cleanup was largely completed, the funds of various enterprises were initially determined, production was relatively normal, and the cash management system was established, the General Accounting Bureau, which had a transitional nature, was abolished. Individual enterprises directly established settlement and credit relationships with the Northeast Bank, with the Northeast Bank understanding and supervising the execution of enterprises' financial plans through settlement and credit. For the finances of each province and city, it was stipulated that, except for public grain, tax revenue, and monopoly income, which must be turned over to the higher authorities without unauthorized use, all local enterprises, real estate, and other income, as well as all expenditures, must be reported in quarterly and annual budgets, enabling the Northeast People's Government to gradually grasp the overall revenue and expenditure plan.

	Secondly, over the past year, the overall fiscal revenue in the Northeast has gradually shifted from being mainly based on agricultural tax to being mainly based on urban tax revenue. All regions have focused on opening up urban financial resources and actively strengthening urban tax revenue work. In 1948, industrial and commercial tax revenue in the Northeast accounted for only 4% of the total revenue. Last year, due to the recovery and development of urban industry and commerce and the emphasis and grasp of this growing tax source by the tax authorities, under a fair and reasonable burden policy, the industrial and commercial tax revenue in the Northeast increased fivefold compared to 1948. When added to customs duties and salt tax, the sum accounted for a proportion of the total revenue that was only 10% less than agricultural tax. The increase in urban tax revenue played a significant role in withdrawing currency and stabilizing financial prices. In January and February of this year, under continued strengthening of leadership, fairness and reasonableness, and improvement of the collection system and methods, urban tax revenue has exceeded the original plan by more than 43%. Based on this situation, it is estimated that urban tax revenue for the entire year of 1950 may exceed agricultural tax by about 25%.

	Thirdly, in the past year, industrial production and various public-owned economies in the Northeast have gradually recovered as a result of strengthened leadership, widespread mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, and vigorous implementation of scientific management systems. This has made the profits of public-owned enterprises a new and larger source of revenue. Judging from the overall tasks of industrial production and trade transportation, etc., which are expected to increase significantly compared to last year, it is highly likely that the revenue from enterprise profits will reach the equivalent of the sum of agricultural tax and industrial and commercial tax. Therefore, establishing a collection system in this area and ensuring the extraction of enterprise profits is one of the central tasks in the Northeast's fiscal revenue this year.

	Finally, another important measure to ensure the improvement of the financial and economic situation in the Northeast is to vigorously practice streamlining and economizing. Since September of last year, the entire Northeast has undergone reorganization, initially determining the total number of people detached from production and the number of personnel in each unit, streamlining approximately 70,000 people, and gradually verifying the number of personnel. Uniform establishment of weapons, vehicles, and horses has been carried out, reducing a lot of waste. The use and consumption of all houses, water and electricity, gasoline, etc., have certain standards. On the payment side, administrative expenses have been reduced, and expenses for construction and procurement have been greatly saved. Due to the appropriate increase in operating expenses and budget expenses, piecemeal additional budgets have also been reduced. However, due to the lack of a unified organization for regular supervision and inspection in the past, some departments have experienced problems such as personnel exceeding the quota, unreasonable personnel ratios, and inconsistent supply standards after the reorganization. These phenomena will be resolved in the upcoming re-adjustment. The main task of local finance is to actively develop production, strive to take the initiative to overcome financial difficulties, and reduce state subsidies to local areas. Village finance in various places is also being rectified in accordance with the principle that all village cadres should shift to production, prohibiting arbitrary apportionments and corruption and waste, in order to gradually reduce expenditures to the prescribed standards.

	After the above-mentioned measures over the past year and a half, the financial and economic situation in the Northeast has become increasingly stable. This is primarily reflected in the relatively stable prices last year. Prices in the Northeast rose by only 80% last year, with a monthly increase rate of 6%. The first quarter of this year even broke the past practice of price volatility in the same season, showing general stability. Taking Shenyang as an example, the monthly increase rate of prices has dropped to 2% over the past three months. Secondly, with the increase in profits of public enterprises and urban tax revenue, and the readjustment of institutions and personnel, the Northeast region's budget this year is likely to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure.

	At present, the financial work in the Northeast has shifted from serving the war to serving production and construction. Before 1949, more than 60% of the financial resources in the Northeast were used to supply the war needs. Last year, because the war had just ended, investment in economic construction accounted for only a little more than 30% of total expenditures. And this year, the funds invested in industrial construction alone account for 42% of the total budget expenditure for the entire year.

　　经过一年艰巨努力取得大转变
    东北财经情况日趋稳定
    经济建设得以空前规模和速度恢复发展
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北地区的财政工作，一年来进行了几件重大措施，使全区财政经济情况日趋稳定与好转。这是在东北全部解放、经济建设成为压倒一切的中心任务的情况下财政上的大转变。这一转变，使东北经济建设得能以空前的规模和速度，恢复和发展起来。这一转变过程，是经过了一番艰巨的努力的。
            财政工作由分散到统一  政府掌握全盘收支计划
    首先，如何使财政工作由分散的状态走向集中统一，是当时亟需解决的问题。过去由于地区上被敌人分割，各省都是各自为政，相互间联系很少。实行集中统一的第一步，就是在方针、政策、计划、制度上统一起来。如制订了统一的全东北公粮征收条例、工商所得税条例、村财政管理条例以及城市财政建设方案；建立了每月实物与现金收支计划，严格确立了收支制度，税收、粮食、专卖等情况均按旬、月报告；规定了一切仓库、金库、粮库的保管检查制度，凡粮食、被服、物资和现金之移交、接收等，须按制度办理。为了增加国家财政收入，限制无谓消耗，去年二月下旬开始，实行烟酒产销管理（即烟酒专卖）。三月中总会计局成立，统一管理工矿、林业、邮电、铁路、航务、贸易、银行等一切国营企业的资金。四月起又实行了现金管理，各机关及公营企业的现金收入，全部存入东北银行，必需的现金支出，按批准的计划由东北银行拨付，总会计局并协同有关部门，进行了国家及地方财产的清理工作，使国家资产得以统一管理。去年年底，在清理资产大致结束、各企业资金已初步确定、生产比较正常及现金管理的制度已经确立的条件下，带有过渡性质的总会计局即行撤消，由各企业单位直接与东北银行建立结算和信贷关系，由东北银行通过结算和信贷来了解与监督企业财政计划的执行。对于各省、市财政，则规定除公粮、税收、专卖收入一律上解不得擅自动用外，一切地方企业、房产与其他收入以及全部支出均须按季按年造报预决算，使东北人民政府能逐渐全盘掌握收支计划。
            财政收入逐渐转变  城市税收大量增加
    其次，一年来东北在整个财政收入上逐渐由以农业税为主转变到以城市税收为主。各地都以开辟城市财源为重点，积极加强城市税收工作。一九四八年东北的工商业税收，仅占总收入的百分之四。去年，由于城市工商业的恢复与发展以及税务机构重视与掌握了这个日益增长的税源，因此在公平合理的负担政策下，东北工商业税收较一九四八年增加了五倍；如加上关税、盐税，其总和与农业税相比，在总收入上所占的比例，只少于农业税百分之十。城市税收的增加，在回笼货币、稳定金融物价上起了很大的作用。今年一、二月份的城市税收，在继续加强领导、公平合理、改进征收制度和征收方法下，已超过了原订计划的百分之四十三强。根据这一情况，估计一九五○年全年城市税收将可能超过农业税百分之二十五左右。
    再次，过去一年中，东北工业生产与各公营经济，由于加强领导、广泛发动工人群众的积极性和创造性、大力推行科学的经营管理制度之结果，已逐步恢复，这使公营企业的利润成为新的更大的财源。从今年工业生产总值及贸易运输等预定较去年大大增长的总任务看来，企业利润的收入很有可能达到相当于农业税与工商业税的总和。因而建立这方面的征收制度，保证企业利润的提解，是今年东北财政收入上的中心工作之一。
            厉行精简节约  减少很多浪费
    最后，保证东北财政经济情况好转的另一重要措施，就是厉行精简节约。去年九月以来，全东北经过整编，初步确定了脱离生产的总人数及各单位人员数量，精简了约七万人，并逐步核实了人数。武器、车辆、马匹均进行了统一编制，减少很多浪费。一切房屋、水电、汽油等的使用和消耗都有一定的标准。在支付方面，减少了行政费用，并大大节省了修建购置等费。由于适当地增加了事业费和预算费，也减少了零星追加预算。但由于以往没有一个统一的机构经常进行监督和检查，以致在整编过后，有些部门又产生了人员超过定额、人员比例不合理、供给标准不一致等问题。这些现象，即将在最近重新调整中求得解决。地方财政的主要任务则是积极发展生产，争取主动战胜财政困难，以减少国家对地方的补助。各地村财政也正根据一切村干部转入生产的方针着手进行整顿，禁止任意摊派与贪污浪费，以求将开支逐渐缩减到规定的标准。
    经过一年半上述这些措施，东北财政经济情况已日趋稳定。这首先表现在去年物价的相当平稳。东北物价去年一年仅上涨百分之八十，逐月递增率为百分之六。今年第一季更打破以往物价在同一季节内容易波动的惯例，普遍显示平稳，以沈阳为例，三个月来物价逐月递增率已降至百分之二。其次，随着公营企业利润与城市税收的增加，机构、人员的重新调整，东北区今年预算已有可能达到收支平衡。
    目前，东北财政工作已从为战争服务转变到为生产建设服务。一九四九年以前，全东北百分之六十以上的财力是供应战争需要的。去年，由于战争刚告结束，对于经济建设的投资只占全部支出的百分之三十强。而今年，仅投入工业建设的资金即占全年总预算支出的百分之四十二。
