　　How to Tax Pig Bristles?
　　To the Editor:
　　I am a pig bristle merchant. The day before yesterday, I went to Zhangfang Town, Fangshan County, to buy goods. They wanted to charge 10% goods tax on pig bristles there, but I heard that Beijing only charges 5% or is even exempt from tax. Please answer the following questions:
　　(1) Why is the pig bristle tax collected in Fangshan different from that in Beijing?
　　(2) Does the State Taxation Administration have a unified goods tax regulation for sale?

　　Mr. Zhai Xiangru:
　　The questions you asked have been answered by the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government as follows:
　　(1) The new goods tax regulations stipulate that the pig bristle tax rate is uniformly 10%. Both Fangshan County and Beijing implement this. The 5% tax you mentioned in Beijing probably refers to the tax rate for pig hair.
　　Because it is inconvenient to levy taxes on pig bristles sporadically, in order to simplify procedures for merchants, the government has decided that pig bristles will be uniformly purchased and sold, and taxes will be collected once after sorting.
　　(2) The Bureau is printing separate editions of various tax regulations and is preparing to entrust Xinhua Bookstore to sell them on its behalf. As soon as they are printed, we will publish a notice in the newspaper.

### 猪鬃如何征税？

　　猪鬃如何征税？编辑同志：
    我是一个猪鬃商人，前天到房山县张坊镇买货，那边猪鬃要上货物税百分之十，但听说北京只上百分之五或免征税。请答复下列问题：
    （一）房山与北京所收的猪鬃税为何不统一？
    （二）税务总局是否有统一的货物税章程出售？
                                                        翟相如翟相如君：
    所询问题已由中央人民政府财政部税务总局答复如下：
    （一）新货物税条例规定，猪鬃税率统一为百分之十。房山县与北京市均按此执行。你所说的北京市按百分之五征收，恐系指猪毛的税率。
    因猪鬃零星征税，诸多不便，为简便商民手续起见，政府已决定猪鬃为统销货物，在整理好后一次征收。
    （二）各项税收条例，本局正在印制单行本准备委托新华书店代售。一俟印就，当即登报通知。
