    Your question has been answered by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government as follows:

    The power industry is a basic industry that produces power. Power plants convert the energy contained in fuels, water flows, or airflows (wind) into readily transmittable forms of power, such as electricity, gas, steam, compressed air, etc., transmit them to distant locations, and distribute them appropriately to various other industries, supplying their needs as well as the daily lives of ordinary residents. Electricity is the most important form of power; it can be transmitted to any location with relatively few restrictions, can be transmitted over long distances with little loss. Since mankind mastered the technology of electricity production, transmission, and distribution, the centralized production of large amounts of power has become possible, thereby greatly reducing the cost of power and enabling various industries to develop rapidly. The power industry in a narrow sense refers to the industry centered on power stations.

　　什么是动力工业
    重工业部答读者问编辑同志：
    什么是动力工业？它包括些什么？
                                    东平县委宣传部侯奎一侯奎一同志：
    你的问题已由中央人民政府重工业部解答如下：
    动力工业是一种基本工业，它生产出来的是动力。动力厂把燃料、水流或气流（风）内所含的能量，转变为便于传输的动力形态，如电力、煤气、蒸汽、压缩空气等，传送到远处，适当地分配给其他各种工业，供应他们以及一般居民日常生活的需要。电力是最重要的一种动力形态，它可以比较不受限制地传输到任何地点，可以传输很远而且损失不大，自从人类掌握了电力的生产传输和分配的技术以后，大量动力的集中生产成为可能，因而大大地降低了动力的成本，使各种工业迅速地发展起来。狭义的动力工业就是指以发电站为核心的工业。
