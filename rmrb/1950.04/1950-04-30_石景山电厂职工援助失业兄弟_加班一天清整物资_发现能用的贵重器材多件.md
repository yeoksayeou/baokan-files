　　Shijingshan Power Plant Employees Assist Unemployed Brothers
    Overtime for a Day to Sort Out Materials
    Discovering Many Usable Valuable Equipment Pieces
    [This newspaper report] On the 23rd (Sunday), the workers of Shijingshan Power Plant volunteered to work overtime, using all their wages to help unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai. The main task that day was to clean up the discarded materials that had accumulated in the plant over the years. After the cleanup work began, the scrap steel pipe group moved hundreds of steel pipes into the warehouse in just two hours. Steel pipes weighing over 400 jin were sometimes lifted and carried by just two people. Other groups, such as the cable group, the firebrick group, and the five-ton coal mill group, all worked with great energy. Engineers and female comrades from the medical team also joined in, lifting angle iron and pulling firebricks alongside the workers.

    The cleanup work increased the country's enormous wealth. Two five-ton coal mills that had been left outdoors for several years, seventy or eighty reels of three-inch and two-inch cables, have now all been sorted out. Firebricks are important equipment in boilers, and currently a sample firebrick is worth more than a bag of flour. Several thousand firebricks scattered around and prepared for building walls have now been moved into the warehouse. More than 80 tons of materials were cleaned up from the scrap iron pile, including finished products, semi-finished products, copper, pig iron, angle iron, etc. Two 300-horsepower motors, a new air pump, a planer, and a dozen or so pumps of various sizes have also been placed in the warehouse. Of particular importance was the discovery of the No. 6 generator centerline and grounding resistor. In the past, it was thought that the above valuable equipment was no longer available, so the No. 6 machine was not installed with these components. Now, as long as a few resistance pieces are added inside, it can be used. A carrier telephone distribution panel was also found.

　　石景山电厂职工援助失业兄弟
    加班一天清整物资
    发现能用的贵重器材多件
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂工人二十三日（星期日）义务加班，以全部工资救助上海失业工人弟兄。那天主要是清理该厂过去多年来的弃散物资。清整工作开始后，废钢管小组只两小时就把百来根钢管抬进了仓库。四百多斤重的钢管，有时两个人便抬起来走了。其他如电缆线小组、耐火砖小组、五吨磨煤机小组都是一鼓劲地干。工程师、医疗小组的女同志也都动了手，和工友一起抬三角铁，拉耐火砖。
    清整工作增加了国家巨量财富。原放在露天地上已数年的两个五吨磨煤机，七、八十轴三寸二寸不等的电缆线，现在都整理了出来。耐火砖是锅炉里的重要器材，目前一块样板耐火砖可值一袋多面粉。在四外丢散的以及准备砌墙的几千块耐火砖现在都搬进了仓库。废铁堆中清理出八十多吨材料。其中有成品、半成品、铜、生铁、角铁等。三百马力的电动机两台和新风泵、刨床、大小十几个水泵也都放进仓库。特别重要的是找到了六号发电机中心线、接地抵抗器。上述宝贵器材过去认为已没有了，所以六号机没有按装这机件，现在只要将里面抵抗片配几块就能用。载波电话配电盘也找到了。
