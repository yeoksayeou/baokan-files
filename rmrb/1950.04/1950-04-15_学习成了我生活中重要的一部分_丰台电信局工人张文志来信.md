　　Learning Has Become an Important Part of My Life

　　Letter from Zhang Wenzhi, Worker at Fengtai Telecommunications Bureau

To the Editor:

　　I am a worker. In addition to my production work, I also study culture, politics, and business, and use criticism and self-criticism, review meetings, etc., to improve our understanding. I read the People's Daily every day, and it cares about our workers' production, life, and learning. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, we had no right to ask about politics. Now, it’s different. We have become the masters of the country. We should study politics well in order to take on the responsibility of being masters. In addition, we also listen to the radio. Now radio is really a good tool for us to learn. From December 1, 1949, we organized a study group to listen to Russian lectures. Starting from April 10, the People’s Radio has added the People's Forum to help us learn about the history of social development and political economics. Two or three months ago, I drew up the three broadcast program schedules for the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the Economic Station, and listened to various programs on time every day. For example, the Beijing People's Radio broadcasts Shandong Kuaiban [a type of Chinese narrative folk art], which other stations don't have; the Central Station broadcasts Japanese and English news, which other stations don't have; the Economic Station broadcasts more new songs. Each station has its own advantages.

　　Some people say to me, "You have changed!" Yes, China has changed. Our working class has become the master of the country and should actively work, study hard, and establish a sense of ownership. Now, in addition to work, reading newspapers, reading books, listening to the radio, and learning Russian, etc., have become an important part of my daily life.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Fengtai Telecommunications Bureau Worker Zhang Wenzhi

　　学习成了我生活中重要的一部分
    丰台电信局工人张文志来信编辑同志：
    我是一个工人，每天除了生产工作外，还要学习文化、政治和业务，并且利用批评与自我批评、检讨会等，来提高我们的认识。我每天在学习看人民日报，它关心我们工人的生产、生活和学习。在国民党反动统治下，我们没有权利过问政治，如今呢，不同了，我们做了国家的主人；我们应该好好学习政治，才能够负起当家作主人的责任。此外，我们还收听广播，现在无线电真是我们学习的一个好工具，从一九四九年十二月一日我们就组织好了收听俄文讲座的学习。从四月十日起人民电台又增设了人民讲坛帮助我们学习社会发展史和政治经济学。我早在两三个月以前，就画了北京市人民广播电台、中央人民广播电台和经济台的三个广播节目表，每日按时收听各项节目，例如北京市人民电台播送的山东快板、旁的电台没有，中央电台播送的日英语新闻，别的台没有，经济台播送的新歌曲比较多，各台有各台的好处。
    有人说我：“你这个人变了！”是的，中国已经改变了，我们工人阶级已经做了国家的主人，应当积极工作、努力学习、树立起主人翁的态度。现在我在工作之外，看报、看书、听广播、学习俄文等已经成了日常生活中重要的一部分了。
