Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 22nd: Workers in various parts of Northeast China are taking action to complete their production plans ahead of schedule to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions' "Labor Daily" recently published an editorial entitled "Welcoming May Day," calling on all workers in Northeast China to organize and concentrate all "May Day" commemorative activities into the power of creating new production records and striving to complete production plans ahead of schedule.

　　The production competition movement to welcome "May Day" in the Dalian area has already begun. The Far East Electric Glass Factory, which completed its entire annual production task in half a year last year, plans to complete 50% of its annual production task before "May Day." Workers at the Cao Da Factory guarantee to exceed the April production plan by 10% and reduce costs by 3%. Workers at the Dalian Railway Factory have launched a friendly competition with the city's ship repair and shipbuilding factories, guaranteeing to exceed this month's production tasks. In Shenyang, workers at the Shenyang Electric Seven Factory and the Chemical Factory Hardened Oil Factory are preparing to commemorate "May Day" by completing the second quarter production tasks one month ahead of schedule; workers at the Fifth Machine Factory and the Electric Signal Factory are actively preparing to create new records in order to ensure the smooth completion of the April production tasks. Workers Li Zhi and Su Lan'ying from the Shenyang Railway Factory have also decided to repair a scrapped machine as a "May Day" gift. Four factories of public utilities in Harbin City have launched a one-and-a-half-month production competition. In order to exchange experience and promote production, Jilin City has decided to hold lectures by advanced producers, model deeds exhibitions, and receptions before "May Day."

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Employees of the state-owned Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu have launched a large-scale production campaign to welcome the upcoming "May Day" Labor Day. The repair shop plans to repair eleven scrapped vehicles to welcome "May Day," while the brick kiln department plans to produce 65,000 catties of lime and 150,000 green bricks, and excavate 430 cubic meters of oil ponds as "May Day" gifts. Employees of the mechanical department rivet factory and the power plant are rushing to manufacture a 500-horsepower boiler and overhaul "May Day" motors and transformers, respectively. Employees of the refinery are rushing to test oil furnaces, striving to begin producing nationally important engine oil by "May Day." In the production campaign, workers and cadres have shown a high degree of production enthusiasm and responsibility. Workers in the repair shop don't even leave work for meals, asking their children to bring them food. Engineers, union directors, and military representatives all participate in work in the workshops and factories, helping workers solve specific difficulties. All employees of the mine are preparing to present glorious flowers and bonuses to the heroes who have made meritorious contributions in production at the "May Day" celebration. (Qu Heming)

　　[Reported by this newspaper] All employees of the Datong Pingwang Power Plant launched a major production competition to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day. In the past half month, new records have been continuously set by various groups. Administratively, the plant planned to erect an 11-li transmission line from Tongjialiang of Datong Mine to Silaogou in one month. After democratic discussion, the 19 technicians and 20 laborers of the line team discovered that the original route could be changed to shorten the mileage. The administration approved the workers' proposal. With the same number of workers, more than 75% of the project has been completed in ten days, and the number of utility poles has been greatly reduced compared to the original plan. Wang Yin, a worker in the machine worker group of the repair department, completed the administrative task of making two sets of large switch gates in nine hours, which was originally scheduled to take 36 hours, shortening the time by three-quarters. The ironworker group completed the task of making screws, which required 28 hours, in 16 hours. The main reason for obtaining the above achievements is that the factory carried out a democratic movement and model evaluation in March, which greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm for production. This "May Day" competition movement was first conceived by the workers and then decided by the workers' representative meeting. Leading cadres went deep into the site to lead the movement; all units established blackboards to commend activists in a timely manner and established workshop merit ledgers as a basis for model evaluation. These practices have greatly improved the morale of the workers. (Tian Lin)

    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北各地工人正以争取提前完成生产计划的行动来迎接“五一”劳动节。东北总工会劳动日报日前以迎接“五一”为题发表社论，号召全东北工人把纪念“五一”的一切活动，全部组织、集中为创造生产新纪录、争取提前完成生产计划的力量。
    旅大地区迎接“五一”的生产竞赛运动早已展开。曾以半年时间完成去年全年生产任务的远东电业玻璃工厂，计划在“五一”节提前完成全年生产任务的百分之五十。曹达工厂工人保证超过四月份生产计划的百分之十，并减低成本百分之三。大连铁路工厂工人已向该市修船、造船厂提出友谊竞赛，保证超过本月生产任务。在沈阳，沈阳电工七厂、化工厂硬化油厂工人准备以提前一个月完成第二季生产任务的成绩来纪念“五一”；第五机器厂、电信号志厂工人都在积极准备创新纪录，以求四月份生产任务的顺利完成。沈阳铁路工厂工人李志、苏兰英等并决定要修复一件报废机器，作为“五一”献礼。哈尔滨市公用事业的四个厂已展开一个半月的生产竞赛。为了交流经验、推动生产，吉林市决定在“五一”前举办先进生产者的讲座、模范事迹画展和招待晚会等。
    【本报讯】甘肃国营玉门油矿职工，展开大规模生产运动，迎接行将到来的“五一”劳动节。修车厂计划修好十一辆废车迎接“五一”，砖窑部计划烧出石灰六万五千市斤，青砖十五万块，并挖油池四百三十立方公尺，作为“五一”献礼。机械部铆工厂和电厂职工，分别赶制五百匹马力锅炉一座与抢修“五一”马达和变压器。炼油厂职工正赶试油炉，争取在“五一”开始生产全国所关心的机油。在生产运动中，工人、干部均表现了高度的生产热情和负责态度。修车厂工人吃饭也不下班，叫孩子送饭吃。工程师、工会主任、军代表都参加到各车间和厂房工作，帮助工人们解决具体困难。该矿全体职工准备在庆祝“五一”的大会上，把光荣的花朵和奖金，献给那些在生产中立功的英雄们。（曲和民）
    【本报讯】大同平旺发电厂全体职工为迎接“五一”劳动节，展开生产大竞赛，半个月来各组连续出现新纪录。该厂行政上计划以一月时期，架设大同矿同家梁至四老沟十一华里的输电线路，经线路分队十九个技工、二十个小工民主讨论，发现可以改变原来路线，缩短里程。行政上批准了工人的建议。还是同数工人，十天中已完成工程的百分七十五以上，电杆也比原计划大为节省。修理部机工组元车工人王银，以九小时完成行政上规定三十六小时作两副开关大闸的任务，缩短时间四分之三。铁工组以十六小时完成需二十八小时的打螺丝任务。获得上述成绩的主要原因，是由于该厂三月份进行了民主运动和评模工作，工人的生产积极性空前提高。此次，“五一”竞赛运动，即是由工人群众先酝酿，又经职工代表会讨论决定的。领导干部在运动中，深入现场领导；各单位都建立了黑板报，及时表扬积极分子，建立车间记功账，作为评模根据。这些作法，都大大提高了工友们的情绪。（田林）
