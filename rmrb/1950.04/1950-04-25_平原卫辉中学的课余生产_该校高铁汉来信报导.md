　　Weihui Middle School in Pingyuan's After-School Production
    Report from Gao Tiehan of the School

    To the Esteemed Editor:
    I am reporting on the production situation of the students at our Pingyuan Provincial Weihui Middle School for the reference of students in Beijing.

    Responding to the government's call for production, the entire school, under the slogan of "learning while producing," resolutely refrains from affecting regular classes or encroaching on morning and evening self-study time, and has launched a large-scale production movement. From the beginning of production until now, in less than a month, we have planted a total of 4,000 willow trees, pagoda trees, fruit trees, cypress trees, etc., exceeding the original plan of two trees per person by more than double. In addition, we have also used barren land and open spaces to plant 240,000 kilns of hemp seeds. Based on the lowest estimate of various harvests, the yield can be worth 300,000 catties of millet; on average, each student can obtain 400 catties of millet, which can provide for a semester's worth of food, books, and clothing expenses.

    The students' enthusiasm for production is very high. When planting hemp seeds, it rained heavily, and the students' clothes were soaked; but on the hills and in the wasteland, the students still insisted on working. The ground was very slippery, and the students often slipped and fell, but they immediately got up and continued to work. ... In this way, the plan was quickly completed.

　　平原卫辉中学的课余生产
    该校高铁汉来信报导编辑同志：
    我把我们平原省立卫辉中学同学的生产情形报告一下，供北京的同学们参考。
    我们响应政府的生产号召，全校在一面学习一面生产的口号下，坚决不影响正课学习、不侵占早晚自习时间，开展了大规模的生产运动。从生产开始到现在，不到一个月光景，我们已种了柳树、洋槐树和果木树、柏树等共四千棵，超过了原订计划每人两棵的一倍多。此外，我们还利用荒地和空地，种植了二十四万窑大麻籽，各项收成按最低限度预计，收获可值三十万斤小米；平均每位同学能得到四百斤小米，可供给一学期的伙食、书籍、衣服费等。
    生产中同学情绪很高。在种大麻籽时，天下起了大雨，同学们的衣服都湿透了；但是在丘陵上和荒地里同学仍旧坚持工作。地很滑，同学们常常滑倒，但立刻爬起来，又继续工作。……这样，很快完成了计划。
