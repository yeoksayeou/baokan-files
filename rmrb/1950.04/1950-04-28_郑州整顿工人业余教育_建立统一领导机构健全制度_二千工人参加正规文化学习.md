　　Zhengzhou Rectifies Workers' Spare-Time Education
　　Establishes Unified Leadership Organization and Improves System, 2,000 Workers Participate in Formal Cultural Learning

　　[Reported by Our Newspaper] Correspondent Zhuang Xiao and Chu Yong reported: The workers' spare-time education work in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, has been initially completed after nearly two months of planned rectification. More than 2,000 workers in the city have participated in formalized spare-time cultural learning.

　　Before the Spring Festival this year, the city's workers' spare-time education had already reached a considerable scale, with no less than 5,000 workers attending large classes (political study) and learning culture and technology. However, the leadership was not unified. The trade union, the education center, and the Youth League were all engaged in workers' study, each acting on its own and not communicating with each other. The city's workers' education work fell into a state of being unplanned. The educational policy was not clear, many study organizations did not have systematic teaching materials, teachers and school locations were not fixed, funds could not be spent, and learning time was not appropriately determined. As a result, workers' study started and collapsed from time to time. Although there were some achievements, the efficiency was not high.

　　After the Spring Festival, the Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in order to improve and rectify the city's workers' spare-time education, formulated the "1950 Workers' Spare-Time Learning Regularization Plan." Starting in March, the following work was carried out according to the plan: (1) A Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee was established, composed of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Bureau of Culture and Education (Education Center), and the Propaganda Department of the Women's Federation, with the Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions as the main body. Through this organization, the connection between relevant departments was strengthened to unify the leadership of the city's workers' education work. (2) 16,500 copies of workers' cultural textbooks and arithmetic textbooks, and 3,000 copies of political teaching materials were reprinted successively. The problem of teaching materials has been basically solved. (3) Cultural teachers of workers' spare-time tutorial schools were registered and fixed. (4) The funding problem has been initially solved. In state-owned enterprises, a part of the cultural and educational expenses is allocated for spare-time school expenses; spare-time schools composed of other scattered workers, shop assistants, etc. are funded by the education center. (5) A grass-roots learning leadership organization has been established. In each learning unit, it is required to establish a learning committee jointly organized by workers' representatives and teachers (sometimes only workers). At present, 33 units have established this kind of organization. (6) A learning system has been established. In terms of the school system: it is determined that each volume of the worker's textbook should be studied for six months (including arithmetic), and three volumes of the worker's textbook can be completed in one and a half years, which can roughly reach the level of graduating from senior elementary school. Each learning unit has also formulated simple or complete rules for class attendance, leave, rewards and punishments, monthly exams, and term exams, and stipulates that graduation certificates will be issued after passing the graduation exam. In terms of study time, factory workers generally study three days a week, one and a half hours each day. Shop assistants, handicraft workers, etc. have slightly more class time. At the same time, each learning unit has established fixed classrooms, some using the factory's club, dining room, dormitory, etc. for classes, and some borrowing classrooms from nearby middle and primary schools.

　　As of now, 34 learning units have started regular learning in the above-mentioned manner, including 63 cultural classes, with a total of 2,205 students.

　　In addition, five workers' political lectures have been established among workers who are relatively scattered and have not organized cultural learning (such as porters, handicraft workers, etc.). The city's federation of trade unions cadres will give systematic explanations on the workers' political textbook once a week from 6:30 to 8:00 in the morning, in order to make up for the deficiencies of the previous political education. About 2,000 workers participated in the lectures. Another 160 workers with a cultural level above senior primary school have formed a political study class to study "Workers' Political Textbook" and "Class Struggle Changes the World".

　　In addition, five larger-scale public and private factories organized 463 workers to learn technology, and formed a city-wide "Workers' Spare-Time Technical Learning Research and Guidance Committee" to strengthen the connection between units, exchange experience, and solve common problems.

　　According to the experience of sorting out workers' education during this period: factories' political, cultural, and technical education cannot be carried out in isolation. Before the city's rectification of workers' spare-time learning, some workers felt that "learning politics all the time is dry and tasteless"; some felt that "learning culture does not learn anything"; some workers proposed "only learning technology," but after studying for a period of time, they felt that it was difficult to learn technology without cultural knowledge. Therefore, after conducting a relatively systematic initial political education among workers, they should promptly switch to regular learning focusing on culture; technical education can be appropriately coordinated in places where conditions permit and workers need it. In leading workers to study, all departments should closely connect and take unified steps. Before the city established a unified leadership organization for workers' spare-time education, there was little contact between departments, and sometimes there were misunderstandings. Even in a study class, cadres from two places would say one thing and I would say another, contradicting each other, making it impossible for the teachers in the study class to work, hindering the normal progress of education work. These shortcomings have been basically overcome after this rectification. However, at present, some administrative cadres in some factories still despise workers' cultural learning and political learning, believing that "learning conflicts with production"; the teaching quality of some teachers cannot meet the needs of workers. These still need to be further improved.

　　郑州整顿工人业余教育
    建立统一领导机构健全制度  二千工人参加正规文化学习
    【本报讯】通讯员庄啸、楚永报道：河南省郑州市的工人业余教育工作，经过将近两个月的有计划的整顿，现已初步就绪。全市已有二千余工人参加正规化的业余文化学习。
    该市的工人业余教育，到今年春节前数量已不小，全市上大课（政治学习）和学文化、学技术的工人不下五千人。但领导不统一，工会、教育馆、青年团都搞工人学习，各自为政，互不通气。全市工人教育工作陷于无计划状态。教育方针不明确，许多学习组织没有系统的教材，教员与校址亦未固定，经费无处开支，学习时间也没有适当确定。因之就使工人学习时起时垮，虽然也有一定的成绩，但效率不高。
    春节以后，该市总工会文教部为提高整顿全市工人业余教育，制订了“一九五○年工人业余学习正规化计划”，三月份起，按计划进行了以下工作。（一）成立了工人业余教育委员会，由中共市委宣传部、总工会文教部、市团委宣传部、文教局（教育馆）、妇联宣传部等部门组成，以市总工会文教部为主。通过这一组织，以加强有关部门的联系，统一领导全市工人教育工作。（二）先后翻印工人文化课本、算术课本一万六千五百册，政治教材三千册。基本上解决了教材问题。（三）登记和固定了工人业余补习学校的文化教员。（四）初步解决了经费问题。公营企业中，划出一部分文教费作业余学校经费；其他零散工人、店员等组成的业余学校，则由教育馆供给经费。（五）建立了基层的学习领导组织。在各学习单位中，要求普遍建立工人代表、教员（有时只有工人）共同组织学习委员会。现已有三十三个单位成立了此种组织。（六）建立了学习制度。在学制方面：确定工人课本每册学习六个月（包括算术），一年半时间学完三册工人课本，大体上可达到高小毕业程度。各学习单位并订立了简单的或完整的上课、请假、奖惩、月考、期考等制度和学习纪律，规定毕业考试及格后发给毕业证书。在学习时间方面，工厂工人一般每星期学习三天，每天学习一点半钟。店员、手工业工人等上课时间稍多。同时，各学习单位均设立了固定的教室，有的利用工厂的俱乐部、饭厅、寝室等上课，有的则借用附近中、小学的教室。
    截至目前为止，已有三十四个学习单位按上述方式开始正规学习，包括六十三个文化班，学员共二千二百零五人。
    此外，在比较分散而没有组织文化学习的工人中（如搬运业、手工业等），建立了五个工人政治讲座，每星期日早晨六时半到八时上大课一次。根据工人政治课本，由市总工会干部进行有系统的讲解，以补前次政治教育的不足。参加讲座的工人约有二千人。另有一百六十名有高级小学以上文化程度的工人组成了政治学习班，学习“工人政治课本”和“阶级斗争改变世界”。
    另有五处规模较大的公私营工厂组织了四百六十三名工人学习技术，并组成了全市性的“工人业余技术学习研究指导委员会”，以加强各单位的联系，交流经验，解决共同性的问题。
    根据此一时期整理工人教育的经验：工厂的政治、文化、技术教育，不能孤立地单独进行。该市在此次整顿工人业余学习以前。有的工人感到“老是学政治，干燥无味”；有的则感到“学文化学不到什么东西”；有的工人提出“只学技术”，结果学了一个时期之后，又感到没有文化学习技术很困难。因此，在工人中进行了比较有系统的初期政治教育之后，应及时转入以文化为主的正规学习；在有条件的与工人需要的地方，可适当地配合进行技术教育。在领导工人学习中，各部门应密切联系，统一步骤。该市未建立统一领导工人业余教育的机构以前，各部门间联系很少，有时且互相误会。甚至在一个学习班中，两处干部你讲一套，我讲一套，互相矛盾，弄得学习班的教员也没有办法工作，阻碍了教育工作的正常进行。这些缺点经此次整顿后已基本上克服。但目前还有部分工厂的行政干部轻视工人文化学习和政治学习，认为“学习与生产”矛盾；部分教员的教学质量也不能满足工人需要。这些还待继续改进。
