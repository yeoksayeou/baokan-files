Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: A comprehensive report from the Polish Press Agency: On March 22nd, a memorial ceremony was held in Warsaw for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Polish revolutionary leader Marchlewski. The ceremony was chaired by Bolesław Bierut, leader of the Polish United Workers' Party. Participants included a representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Pospelov, Director of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, Albert, the Mayor of Greater Berlin representing the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and diplomatic representatives from various People's Democratic countries. In his speech, Bierut quoted Marchlewski's famous saying: "Only by serving the interests of the international proletariat can one serve the interests of the Polish nation." He also pointed out that Marchlewski had steadfastly defended the international solidarity demonstrated by the Polish, Russian, and German proletariats in their struggles for national liberation. Now, the victorious Russian people and the politically rejuvenated German working class join us in honoring this leader of the Polish working class.

At the meeting, Pospelov returned the battle flag of Białystok to Bierut. This flag was presented to the Polish Provisional Revolutionary Committee by the workers of Białystok in 1920. At that time, the chairman of the committee was Marchlewski. The flag had been preserved in the Soviet Museum of the Revolution in accordance with Marchlewski's wishes.

Marchlewski's ashes were also returned to Poland on the anniversary. He passed away in Italy on March 22, 1925, and was cremated in Genoa. According to his wishes, his ashes were buried in the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery in Berlin. In 1933, the Hitler gang razed the cemetery. Recently, members of the Polish United Workers' Party, together with representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, located the ashes. When the ashes were transported, Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, personally went to the station to escort them and delivered a speech, pointing out that Marchlewski was a long-tested friend of the German working class, a loyal and unyielding fighter against imperialism, national oppression, and war, and a figure who devoted his life to the struggle for peace, mutual understanding between nations, and socialism.

　　马尔奇列夫斯基逝世廿五周年
    波举行纪念会       
    苏德等国外交代表参加
    【新华社三十一日讯】综合波兰通讯社消息：三月二十二日，华沙举行了波兰革命领袖马尔奇列夫斯基逝世二十五周年的纪念会，由波兰统一工人党领袖贝鲁特任主席。参加纪念会的，有苏联共产党代表、马恩列学院院长波斯伯洛夫，德国统一社会党的代表大柏林市长艾伯特，以及人民民主国家的外交代表。贝鲁特在其演说中援引马尔奇列夫斯基的名言称：“只有服务于国际无产阶级的利益，才能服务于波兰民族的利益”，他并指出：马尔奇列夫斯基曾不屈不挠地保卫着波兰、俄国与德国无产阶级在争取民族自由的斗争中所表现的国际团结。现在，胜利的俄国人民和现在已在政治上获得新生的德国工人阶级，与我们一道尊崇这位波兰工人阶级的领袖。
    波斯伯洛夫在会上把比亚里斯多克的战旗交还贝鲁特，此旗是比亚里斯多克的工人在一九二○年送给波兰革命临时委员会的，当时，委员会的主席即为马尔奇列夫斯基，这面旗帜一直遵照马尔奇列夫斯基的意旨保存在苏联革命博物馆中。
    马尔奇列夫斯基的骨灰，亦于纪念日运回波兰。他于一九二五年三月二十二日在意大利逝世，其后在热那亚火葬，遵照他的遗志，他的骨灰葬于柏林佛里德里西墓场。一九三三年，希特勒匪帮将墓场夷平，最近始由波兰统一工人党派员会同德国统一社会党的代表将骨灰找到。骨灰启运时，德国统一社会党主席皮克亲赴车站护送，并发表演说，指出马尔奇列夫斯基是德国工人阶级久经考验的友人，是反帝国主义、反对民族压迫与战争的忠贞不屈的斗士，是一位毕生为和平、各民族间相互谅解与社会主义而斗争的人物。
