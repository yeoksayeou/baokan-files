　　Improving the Operating Methods of Street Cooperatives
    Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative Vigorously Sells Goods
    Over 18,000 New Members Developed in March
    Adapting to Stable Prices

    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to adapt to the stable price situation, the Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative is vigorously promoting the sale of inventory and has decided to strengthen the business operations of street consumer cooperatives and change their operating methods: (1) Further connect with the masses. Regularly hold meetings of member representatives and forums for activists to widely solicit opinions from members and jointly discuss how to improve business. Through these meetings, members can understand the benefits of the cooperative to the masses. For example, for some goods, the prices charged by private merchants are not more expensive than the cooperative, and may even be cheaper, but members generally recognize that this is only a temporary phenomenon and still buy goods from the cooperative. (2) Improve the quality of goods and prepare a complete range of products to meet the needs of members. (3) Abolish the shift system and extend working hours so that members can buy goods at any time. (4) Systematically establish a consumer network and establish branches in all streets. Four branches were established in the Eighth District in March, so that members can buy things near their homes, which greatly increased sales volume. (5) Establish cooperative canteens in places where working people gather to sell meals at low prices. Two canteens were established in the Twelfth District, offering a 10% discount to members, and meals could be purchased for just over one thousand yuan. In addition, a vegetable department was added to the cooperative, selling vegetables to members at a price of 200 yuan per catty lower than the market price. Since the street cooperative adopted the above methods of operation, the public has responded very well, and sales have increased significantly. The confidence of cooperative cadres has also been increasing.

    [Another dispatch] In order to expand the trade volume of cooperatives and serve the masses more effectively, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative planned to develop 14,900 new members in March. Recently, due to the improvement of the operating methods of the General Cooperative and the increasing number of citizens in various streets requesting to join the cooperative, as of the end of March, a total of 18,315 new members were developed, exceeding the original plan by 23 percent.

　　改进街道合作社经营方式
    京供销总社大力销货     
    三月份发展社员达一万八千余人
    适应物价稳定情况                                
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市供销合作总社为适应物价稳定情况，大力推销存货，决定加强街道消费合作社的业务经营，改变经营方式：（一）进一步联系群众。经常召开社员代表会与积极分子座谈会，广泛征求社员意见，共同讨论如何改进业务。并通过此种会议，使社员了解到合作社对群众的利益。如某些货品，目前私商售价比合作社并不贵，甚至便宜些，但社员一般已认识到这只是暂时的现象，仍然买合作社的货品。（二）提高货品质量，种类预备齐全，以满足社员的需要。（三）取消上下班制，延长工作时间，社员随时都可买货。（四）有计划地建立消费网，在各街道普遍设立分社。八区在三月份建立了四个分社，社员在家门附近就能买到东西，因之销货量大增。（五）在劳动人民聚集的地方，建立合作食堂，廉价卖饭。十二区建立了两个食堂，九扣优待社员，一千余元就可用饭一次。此外，合作社内并添设青菜部，以每斤低于市价二百元的价格，卖给社员。街道合作社自采取上述方式经营以来，市民反映很好，销货量显著增多。合作社干部的信心，也日益加强。
    【又讯】市供销合作总社为扩大合作社的贸易额，更多地为群众服务，曾计划在三月份，发展社员一万四千九百人。近来由于合作总社经营方式改善，各街道市民要求入社者增多，截至三月底，共发展社员一万八千三百十五人，超过原来计划百分之二十三。
