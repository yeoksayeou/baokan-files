　　Fifth District Residents' Representatives Hold Symposium
    Decide to Use Courtyard Vacant Land for Vegetable Planting
    [Our Newspaper] The Fifth District Office recently convened a symposium of residents' representatives from three central police stations to discuss a resolution on utilizing courtyard vacant land for agricultural production. Seventeen representatives attended, and everyone agreed that if every household in Beijing could make the most of their courtyard vacant land to plant vegetables or other crops, it would not only improve the lives of some people but also cultivate the habit of labor among the general public. It is a matter worth promoting and implementing. During the symposium, good solutions were found for some of the difficulties in this production. For example, if the soil in some courtyards is poor or watering is difficult, crops such as wax gourds, pumpkins, hyacinth beans, tomatoes, and potherb mustard can be planted, because these crops only need to have some better soil replaced in two square feet of ground (there is very good black soil now being excavated from Sanhai), and they can spread more than twenty feet. And wax gourds and pumpkins require very little water. Regarding the seed problem, several families can gather together and find someone who understands to buy seeds from farmers coming from the countryside near Deshengmen and Andingmen. If there are air-raid shelters in some courtyards, frames can be built on top of them, allowing bean and gourd vines to climb, which can serve as natural camouflage and also increase the beauty of the courtyard.
    After the meeting, the district is preparing to establish a production guidance committee, and each police station will establish a production guidance team, absorbing people with production experience to participate in the leadership of the committee or team. The district's Culture and Education Section and the police stations will conduct in-depth publicity through adult night schools and various mass meetings, mobilizing everyone to help each other and solve various technical difficulties.

　　第五区居民代表开座谈会
    决定利用庭院空地种菜
    【本报讯】五区区公所日前特召开三个中心派出所居民代表座谈利用庭院空地进行农业生产的决议。到会代表十七人，大家认为北京市每户居民如能尽量利用庭院空地种植菜蔬或其他农作物，既可改善一部分人的生活，又可使一般市民养成劳动习惯，是一件很值得提倡和推行的事。座谈中对此项生产的某些困难也得出很好的解决办法，如有的院内土壤不好或浇水困难，可以种烧瓜、南瓜、扁豆、西红柿、雪里红等农作物，因为这些作物只需要在二方尺的地面上换一些较好的泥土（现在挖三海，有很好的黑泥土），即可蔓延二十余尺。而烧瓜、南瓜所需要的水分也很少。种子问题可以几家集合找懂得的人到德胜门、安定门附近向由乡间来的农民购买。有些院内有防空壕的可以在上面搭起架子，使豆、瓜藤子上爬，可作天然的掩蔽，又可增加庭院的美观。
    会后，该区并准备成立生产指导委员会，每派出所成立生产指导小组，吸收有生产经验的人参加委员会或小组的领导。区文教科和派出所将通过成人夜校和各种群众会议进行深入的宣传。发动大家互相帮助，解决各种技术上的困难。
