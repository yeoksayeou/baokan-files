　　Taiyuan Railway Bureau Improves Freight Locomotive Efficiency
    Saving Seventy-Five Locomotives in March
    [Our Dispatch] The daily car-kilometers of freight locomotives at the Taiyuan Railway Bureau universally exceeded the bureau's set standard in March, saving a total of seventy-five locomotives for the month. Through the efforts of all employees, especially with the assistance of the dispatching office, the locomotive operating efficiency improved significantly in March with proper handling of train operations throughout the month. The original standard was: 263.3 kilometers for standard gauge and 249.3 kilometers for narrow gauge. In March, except for sections like Linfen and Yuncheng, which only reached the standard for that section due to new lines, freight locomotives in all other bureaus generally improved, averaging an excess of 20.3 kilometers for standard gauge and 37.5 kilometers for narrow gauge. Based on the average number of locomotives actually in use, 19.2 for standard gauge and 6.9 for narrow gauge, a total of 2.5 locomotives were saved per day and seventy-five locomotives were saved for the month. The Taiyuan South Station locomotive depot performed the best, and the railway bureau plans to reward them. (Gao Xue)
