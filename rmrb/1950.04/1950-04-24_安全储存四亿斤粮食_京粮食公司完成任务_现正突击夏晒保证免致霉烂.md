　　Safely Storing 400 Million Jin of Grain
	Beijing Grain Company Completes Task
	Now Rushing Summer Drying to Prevent Mold and Rot
	[Our Newspaper's Report] Reporter Jin Yu reports: The cadres and warehouse management personnel of the Beijing Grain Company, displaying a spirit of active responsibility and selfless dedication, overcame various difficulties and victoriously completed the task of storing nearly 400 million jin of grain. Starting from April, they have begun a concentrated effort of summer drying to ensure that this huge amount of grain can survive the "dangerous season of grain mold and rot."
	In the past, the Beijing Grain Company often stored 50 million jin of grain, and had only three warehouses for storage. Last winter, after accepting the task of storing a large amount of grain, they first encountered two major difficulties: an insufficient number of cadres to allocate and dilapidated warehouses. In order to overcome the shortage of manpower, the company adopted the method of mobilizing everyone regardless of their position, improving work efficiency, and extending working hours. During the most intense period of receiving grain, all the cadres of the company, except for a few accounting personnel, went out to help. In December of last year, the maximum number of grain cars arriving daily was 156, in addition to the fiscal grain continuously transported by trucks and carts. Because the Railway Bureau urgently needed to mobilize freight cars, it was necessary to unload the cars day and night. The personnel responsible for receiving grain often worked in wind and snow. Some grain receiving personnel worked continuously for 48 hours. During the Lunar New Year, because road transportation continued as usual, the grain receiving work did not stop. On New Year's Eve, they still insisted on receiving grain in the cold wind. These personnel did not take a holiday during the Spring Festival, and they never rested on ordinary Sundays or holidays.
	Our warehouse facilities are quite simple, three of which are open-air stacking yards. At the beginning of grain receipt, the large grain pool method was adopted (using sacks to surround the grain, each grain pool can hold 1-2 million jin of grain). Then, the grain was sorted by variety and changed to piles and stacks. In order to solve the contradiction between the narrow warehouse and the large variety of grains, the company widely promoted the "Stack Placement Command Map" created by the Guang'anmen warehouse (first measure the warehouse area, divide it into areas, and then use movable symbols to replace the grain according to the type, origin, dryness, etc., and place them on the map) and the stack signs (the signs are marked with the name, quantity, arrival date, quality, etc.). In addition, ventilation stacking and live-core stacking methods were adopted, and the worker stacking responsibility system and the cadre storage responsibility system were implemented. In this way, the capacity of the warehouse was increased, the management of piles and stacks was orderly, the accidents of pile collapse were reduced, and a large amount of wet grain did not become moldy and safely passed through the winter and spring seasons.
	There are many reasons why the company was able to successfully complete the storage task. In addition to the full administrative preparation, the full guarantee of the Party branch, and the active efforts of all staff, the mobilization and reliance on the worker masses by the warehouse cadres, the widespread adoption of workers' opinions, and the implementation of the worker stacking responsibility system were very important factors. Workers voluntarily participated in voluntary labor in the warehouse, such as the workers in the Guang'anmen warehouse who automatically participated in snow sweeping and mat covering work after snow and before rain, which not only saved expenses but also played a great role in storing grain.
	The company and its warehouses have implemented a relatively sound inspection system (including: the custodian's inspection of the grain to be stored, the company's storage and transportation department assigning special personnel to inspect specific warehouses, and the company's inspection team regularly inspecting each warehouse). It also has a great effect on warehousing work.
	Although the company's storage work has achieved considerable results, there are still some shortcomings in the work. For example, the reward and punishment system is not yet sound, and there are no appropriate rewards for many active and responsible personnel; there are no active and effective measures for preventing rats, sparrows, and insects; and the storage work is not widely combined with scientific methods.
	In April, each warehouse launched the work of dumping stacks and turning over and drying wet grain. It is planned to reduce the moisture content of wet corn to 14.5% before the Grain Rain in the lunar calendar, and then to 13-14% by the Beginning of Summer. Nearly 100 million jin of grain have been turned over and dried so far. Seventy percent of the wet grain has been dried. The company's storage and transportation department and warehouse cadres have unanimously expressed their confidence in completing the summer drying plan as scheduled.

　　安全储存四亿斤粮食
    京粮食公司完成任务
    现正突击夏晒保证免致霉烂
    【本报讯】记者进宇报道：北京市粮食公司的干部和仓库管理人员，发扬积极负责、废寝忘食的工作精神，战胜种种困难，胜利地完成了近四亿斤粮食的仓储任务。由四月份起，已开始突击夏晒，保证巨量粮食渡过“粮食霉烂的危险季节”。
    京粮食公司过去经常存储粮食五千万斤，储粮的仓库仅有三个。去冬接受了大量储粮的任务，首先遇到干部不敷分配和仓库简陋两大困难。该公司为了克服人力缺乏的困难，采取了不分职别总动员，提高工作效率，延长工作时间的办法。在接粮最紧张的时期，该公司全体干部，除了少数会计人员外，大家一起出马。去年十二月间，每日最多来粮一百五十六个车皮，此外还有汽车、大车陆续运来的财政粮。由于铁路局急需调用车皮，因此需要昼夜不停的卸车。负责收粮的人员经常在风雪中进行工作。若干接粮人员曾有连续工作四十八小时者。在旧历春节期间，因为路运照常进行，收粮工作迄未停止。旧年除夕，他们还在寒风中坚持收粮工作。这些人员在春节没有休假，平时的星期日和例假日，也从来没有休息过。
    我们的仓库设备相当简陋，其中三个是露天堆场。收粮初期是采用大粮池办法（用麻袋装粮围圈，每个粮池能盛一、二百万斤食粮）。随后再分别粮种改用囤、垛。为了解决仓库狭窄和粮种繁多的矛盾，该公司广泛推广了广安门仓库创造的“囤垛置放指挥图”（先把仓库面积测量，划区，再根据粮种、产地、干湿等情况，分别以活动符号代替，置于图上）和囤垛牌（牌上载有品名、数量、来期、品质等）等办法。此外，并采用了通风垛、活心囤的储藏法，实行了工人囤垛负责制和干部保管负责制。这样，就使得仓库的容纳量增多，囤垛管理得有条不紊，减少了囤垛倾倒事故，使大批湿粮没有发霉，安全渡过冬春两季。
    该公司得以胜利完成仓储任务的原因很多。除了行政上准备充分，党支部全力保证，全体工作人员的积极努力之外，仓库干部发动和依靠工人群众，广泛采纳工人意见，实行工人囤垛负责制，是其中一个很重要的因素。工人自动参加库中义务劳动，如广安门仓库的工人，在雪后雨前自动参加扫雪、盖席工作，不仅节省了经费的开支，对保管粮食也起到很大的作用。
    该公司及各仓库实行了较健全的检查制度（其中包括：保管员对应保管粮食的检查，公司储运科指定专人到专库检查，公司所组检查组对各库定期检查等）。也对仓储工作有绝大的作用。
    该公司的仓储工作虽已获得相当成绩，但在工作中还存在着若干缺点。如奖惩制度还不健全，对许多积极负责的人员没有适当的奖励；对防鼠、防雀、防虫尚无积极有效的措施；仓储工作没有广泛的结合科学方法等。
    四月份中，各仓库展开倒囤和翻晒湿粮的工作。预定在农历谷雨之前把湿玉米的水份降低到百分之一四·五，到立夏再降低到百分之一三至一四。目前已翻晒的粮食已近亿斤。湿粮已有百分之七十晒干。该公司储运科和仓库干部一致表示有信心如期完成夏晒计划。
