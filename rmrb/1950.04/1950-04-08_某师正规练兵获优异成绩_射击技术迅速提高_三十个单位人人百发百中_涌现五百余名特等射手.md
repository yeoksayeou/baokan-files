　　A Certain Division Achieves Excellent Results in Formal Military Training
    Shooting Skills Rapidly Improve
    Thirty Units Achieve Perfect Scores; Over Five Hundred Outstanding Marksmen Emerge
    [From Our Correspondent] Reporter Zhao Wenbin reports: A certain division of the People's Liberation Army's North China Military Region has achieved astonishing results after two months of formal shooting education. New recruits account for three-quarters of the division's officers and soldiers, and their shooting skills were relatively low. The shooting education began during the severe winter season, and the officers and soldiers practiced hard in the icy and snowy fields of Chahar. From January to March, the division's shooting skills rapidly improved. In the fourth live-fire rifle shooting exercise held in mid-March (200 meters distance, ten-ring target, three shots per person), the division's hit rate reached 99.8%; the hit rate of bullets reached 98.2%. Compared with the first live-fire shooting exercise held at the beginning of the education, the number of people hitting the target increased by 15.1%; the number of bullets hitting the target increased by 17.1%. The division saw the emergence of thirty units with perfect scores (twenty-three companies, seven battalion headquarters), fifty first-class shooting units, three hundred and ninety-five rifle outstanding marksmen, and one hundred and thirty-seven light and heavy machine gun outstanding marksmen, creating an unprecedented shooting record for the division. The soldiers' shooting theory has also rapidly improved. According to statistics from a certain regiment, more than 90% of the total number of people have correct shooting postures and movements; 82% are proficient in all aspects of the unified shooting techniques.

    The reasons for achieving the above results are, first and foremost, the in-depth mobilization of Party and political work, which stimulated the soldiers' enthusiasm for practicing their skills. During the winter training, the division convened a work-study representative meeting, which gathered the wisdom of the masses, enriched the experience of leadership work, and created a variety of effective educational methods. During the education process, the cadres regularly checked the "stubborn habits" in the soldiers' shooting movements and corrected the ideological concerns of some soldiers who believed that the "79" rifle had too much recoil and was not as accurate as the "38" rifle through demonstration education and scientific explanations, establishing progressive confidence. Secondly, emphasis was placed on cadre education, with cadres taking the lead in drills. All units adhered to the "small drills" for cadres at the platoon, squad, and group levels, strengthened the preparation lessons for cadres above the company level and instructors of various arms, and held universal tests to promote the military theory learning of cadres. At the same time, the division and regimental leaders proposed to cultivate a large number of "little teachers" as assistants in military training. In two months, the division cultivated 844 "little teachers," who played a significant role in each company. Thirdly, they humbly absorbed experience from all sides, believed in science, and opposed empiricism. The division had little experience in formal technical education, so they humbly learned from the training experiences of other brother units. The division commander studied the experience introductions in the "North China Liberation Army" newspaper and personally disseminated them to the entire division. At the same time, in the training, they focused on combining the explanation of theory with practical drills, correcting the thinking of some cadres and soldiers who previously did not believe in scientific theory. For example, among 251 people in a certain unit, 161 had no confidence in the new shooting techniques. Some soldiers believed that "it doesn't matter whether you know the techniques, as long as you hit the target." Through repeated encouragement from the cadres and education through demonstration shooting, these ideas were corrected, making everyone believe in the importance of scientific theory. In addition, in this training, the division paid attention to the leadership method of combining comprehensive mastery with focused training, frequently conducting investigations and research, cultivating good models to promote everyone's progress, and helping units or individuals with slower progress to catch up, thus the overall performance of the division improved, overcoming the uneven development in past military training.

　　某师正规练兵获优异成绩
    射击技术迅速提高
    三十个单位人人百发百中  涌现五百余名特等射手
    【本报讯】通讯员赵文彬报道：人民解放军华北军区某师，经过两个月的正规射击教育，获得了惊人的成绩。该师干部、战士的新成份占四分之三，射击水准较低。射击教育开始时正值严寒季节，干部、战士们在察北某地的冰天雪地中苦练。由一月至三月，全师的射击技术迅速提高。三月中旬举行的第四次步枪实弹射击（二百米距离，十环靶，每人三发）的成绩，全师命中人数占百分之九十九点八；命中弹数占百分之九十八点二。和教育开始时举行的第一次实弹射击的成绩比较，命中人数增加百分之十五点一；命中弹数增加百分之十七点一。全师出现了三十个百发百中的单位（二十三个连队，七个营部），五十个甲等射击单位，三百九十五名步枪特等射手和一百三十七名轻重机关枪特等射手。创造了该师空前的射击纪录。战士的射击理论也迅速提高，据某团统计，射击中各项姿式动作全部正确者占总人数的百分之九十以上；一元化射击要领全部熟练者占百分之八十二。
    获得上述成绩的原因，首先是党、政工作的深入动员，启发了战士练好技术的情绪。该师在去冬练兵中，曾召开工作学习代表会议，集中了群众的智慧，丰富了领导工作的经验，创造了多种有效的教育方法。在教育进程中，干部们经常检查战士射击动作上的“痼癖”，并以示范教育和科学的说明纠正一部分战士认为“七九”枪坐力大，不如“三八”枪打得准的思想顾虑，树立了进步的信心。其次是重视干部教育，干部带头操练。各部坚持排、班、组三级干部的“小操”，加强了连以上干部及各兵种教员的准备课，并举行普遍测验，以推动干部的军事理论学习。同时，师团领导上提出大量培养“小先生”，作为练兵的助手。两个月中，全师培养了八百四十四名“小先生”，在各连队中起了重大作用。第三，虚心吸取各方经验，相信科学，反对经验主义。该师对正规技术教育经验较差，即虚心学习各兄弟部队练兵的经验。该师师长研究了“华北解放军”报上的经验介绍，亲自向全师传播。同时，练兵中注重讲解理论与实际操练相结合，纠正一部分干部战士以前不相信科学理论的思想。如某部二百五十一人中曾有一百六十一人对新的射击要领无信心。有的战士认为“管他要领不要领，打得中就算好”。经干部的反复启发，并以示范射击来进行教育，纠正了这些思想，使大家相信科学理论的重要。此外，该师此次练兵中，注意了全面掌握与重点训练相结合的领导方法，经常调查研究，一面培养好的典型，推动大家进步；一面帮助进步较慢的单位或个人，使其迎头赶上，因此全师成绩普遍提高，克服了过去部队练兵中发展不平衡的现象。
