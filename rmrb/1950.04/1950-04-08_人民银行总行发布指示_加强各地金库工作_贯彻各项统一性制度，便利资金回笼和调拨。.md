　　People's Bank of China Headquarters Issues Instructions to Strengthen Treasury Work in Various Regions
    Implement Various Unified Systems to Facilitate Capital Repatriation and Allocation.
    [This News] According to the Central Financial and Economic Committee: The People's Bank of China, in order to cooperate with and assist various public enterprises in the repatriation and allocation of cash, and to make the bank a cash center, has successively established agency treasuries and allocation contracts with the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Ministry of Trade. This agency treasury work has achieved considerable success since its implementation.
    According to statistics, the total amount of collections for various public enterprises in the most recent month reached 1,609.4 billion yuan. However, in the process of implementation, there are still many shortcomings in local banks: such as bank office hours being too short, not being open on Sundays, failure to promptly count the money sent, and remittances not arriving immediately. For example, the Beijing Trade Department's telegraphic transfer to Tianjin on the afternoon of March 11th resulted in the Fur Company not receiving the funds until the morning of March 13th. This situation has a great impact on the repatriation and allocation of funds for public enterprises. The People's Bank of China Headquarters believes that if this slow phenomenon is not immediately improved, it will seriously affect the completion of the bank's tasks. Therefore, on March 24th, specific measures were issued to various district and branch offices to improve treasury work. The main points of the instructions are as follows:
    1. Implement a closed-door office method on Sundays and outside of office hours, without external business or payments, but dedicated personnel must be assigned to count and receive funds from the Central Treasury, various enterprise treasuries, and deposits from major enterprise departments.
    2. Implement a day and night shift system for cashiers according to the needs of each treasury. Ensure that various treasury payments are deposited into the treasury on the same day (if the detailed counting cannot be completed, the large amount must be counted and deposited into the treasury). Ensure that treasury payments are not restricted by office hours. The number of cashier staff can be appropriately increased as needed, first by district and branch offices reassigning existing personnel. If this is still insufficient, the headquarters can supplement staff from surplus personnel in the printing factory.
    3. Simplify procedures, improve work efficiency, and accelerate allocation and remittance speeds. All levels of banks should immediately inspect and make effective improvements, and strictly implement various unified systems. Telegraphs and telegraphic transfers of treasury funds and head office reports that should be sent on the same day must be sent on the same day. The head office has now begun to implement a night shift, and head office daily report banks should also add a night shift when necessary, with dedicated personnel to handle it.
    In order to complete the cash revenue and expenditure plan and the task of currency repatriation, it is hoped that the People's Bank of China in various regions should carefully study and implement the instructions of the head office and do a good job in agency treasury work.

　　人民银行总行发布指示  加强各地金库工作
    贯彻各项统一性制度，便利资金回笼和调拨。
    【本报讯】据中央财经委员会消息：中国人民银行为了配合与帮助各公营企业现金的回笼与调拨，使银行成为现金出纳中心，曾先后与中央铁道部、燃料工业部、重工业部、中央贸易部等单位，建立代理金库与调拨合同。此项代理金库工作，实行以来已获得不少成绩。
    据统计在最近一个月内，代理各公营企业收款总数即达一六○九四亿元。但在执行过程中，各地银行还存在不少缺点：如银行办公时间太短，星期日不办公，送去款不能及时点收，以及汇款不能即时到达等。如三月十一日下午北京贸易部电汇天津款，就曾发生过到十三日上午皮毛公司尚未收到的事情。此种情形，对公营企业资金回笼与汇拨影响甚大。人民银行总行认为：此种缓慢现象，如不立即改进，将会严重影响该行任务之完成。因此，特于三月二十四日向各区、分行发出指示，规定具体办法，改进金库工作。指示要点如下：
    一、在星期日及办公时间以外，实行关门办公办法，不对外营业，不付款，但必须设专人点收中央金库款、各企业金库款及各大企业部门之存款。
    二、根据各金库之需要，实行出纳昼夜班制。做到应交各种金库款要当日入库（如细数点不完，必须将大数点清入库）。使应交金库款，不受办公时间之限制。出纳人员可根据需要适当增加，先由区分行在现有人员中自行调剂，如仍不够，总行可由印刷厂编余人员中补调。
    三、简化手续，提高工作效率，加强调拨与汇兑速度。各级行应即检查，并作有效的改进，严格执行统一性的各种制度。必须做到当天的应发电报、应电汇库款及头寸报告当天发出。总行现已开始实行夜班，各头寸日报行必要时亦应加夜班，设专人办理。
    为了完成现金收支计划与回笼货币任务，希望各地人民银行，应认真研究与执行总行指示，做好代理金库工作。
