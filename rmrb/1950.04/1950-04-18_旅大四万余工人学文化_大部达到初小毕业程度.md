Lüda, April 17th (By our reporter Lán Cūn) Since the literacy campaign for workers in the Lüda area of Northeast China began in March of last year, it has achieved great results due to the correct grasp of the mass line working method. According to statistics from June of last year, 80 percent of the 50,713 illiterate workers in the entire area had participated in learning. By the end of last year, general illiterate workers had learned 600 to 700 characters, the best had learned more than 2,000 characters, and individual workers had learned 3,000 characters. Most workers learned to write and read – writing diaries, writing blackboard newspaper articles, and reading employee tabloids. Based on the development of the movement last year and the achievements obtained, it is planned that around the October Revolution anniversary this year, 80 percent of the workers currently participating in learning can completely recognize 1,200 characters, reaching the level of primary school graduation.

　　Conducting Cultural Grievance Meetings to Inspire Enthusiasm for Learning

The above achievements were obtained, on the one hand, because of the recovery and development of production in the area, the improvement of workers' lives, and the raising of class consciousness; on the other hand, it was because the leadership organs of the Chinese Communist Party Committee, the government, and the trade union in the area adopted a leadership method of following the mass line in the literacy movement, focusing on stimulating the workers' consciousness of learning. At the beginning of the literacy movement, enterprises and factories first convened worker conferences and illiterate worker conferences, organizing illiterate workers to air their grievances. Then, these painful facts were collected and compiled into various dramas and Yangko dances to carry out universal propaganda to the workers. This made the workers realize that their low level of education was one of the evil consequences of the rule and oppression of Japanese imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries. Today, the workers have stood up and become masters; if they do not learn culture, they will not be able to consolidate the fruits of victory well. In this way, the workers' conscious demand for cultural learning was improved, and the literacy movement was vigorously launched.

　　Recalling Learning Achievements to Consolidate Learning Emotions

In July and August of last year, the area also launched a school-building movement. First, the workers were inspired to recognize the benefits of classing and grading according to their cultural level for their own learning. Then, based on the investigation and registration of workers' literacy status, exam scores, and the workers' own opinions, classes were compiled, lists were posted for public announcement, and the workers made the final evaluation and decision. This smoothly transformed the literacy movement from various scattered literacy classes and groups to regular spare-time cultural supplementary schools. The workers' learning emotions were consolidated. In September and October, in carrying out the creative model movement of the workers' literacy movement, the area also held a "recall movement." Workers were asked to recall their learning over the past few months, compare their situations before and after learning, and see their progress. This further inspired their enthusiasm for learning and, in turn, checked their own strengths and weaknesses in learning, and determined the direction of future efforts. After creating models and recalling the movement, the learning enthusiasm of the workers in the entire area increased sharply. The harvest of eight months of learning was greatest during this period. After November, the recall movement was turned into a regular system held once a week.

　　Teachers are Active and Responsible, Preparing Lessons Collectively

In solving the problem of teachers, the area also adopted the method of ideological mobilization. First, employees and trade union cadres of various enterprises and factories were mobilized to participate in the cultural grievance movement of workers. This allowed employees and cadres from intellectual backgrounds to deeply understand the pain of workers' illiteracy, and voluntarily become cultural teachers for workers or help workers solve the difficulties in cultural learning. Then, the factory's trade union and administration convened intellectual and cadre meetings, calling on employees and cadres to help workers learn. When employees signed up one after another, automatically requesting to be teachers, the administration and the trade union selected those with better conditions for formal employment, and persuaded some employees with too low a level of education to be "little teachers." The teachers and "little teachers" produced under these circumstances are generally able to be active and responsible, and persist in teaching. The shortcomings of these teachers are that their cultural level is not high and they lack teaching experience. To this end, the area adopted methods such as running training classes, organizing teacher research associations, collective lesson preparation, and visiting teaching methods, and implemented "teach what you learn, do what you teach" to improve teachers' teaching ability and ability to organize and lead learning. In the recall movement, teachers also recalled their own teaching work and reviewed their strengths and weaknesses in teaching. Over the past year, teachers have also made significant improvements and progress.

　　Adjusting Organizations and Reducing Meetings to Ensure Workers' Learning Time

In addition, the area has also obtained better solutions to the issues of workers' learning time and teaching materials. At the beginning of the literacy movement, many factories could not fully guarantee workers' learning time; some factories could only study for two or three hours a week. The main reason was that the labor organization of factory production was not well organized and there were too many meetings. In order to solve this problem, the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions conducted careful investigation and research, and jointly issued instructions with the government education department, requiring all enterprises and institutions to ensure that workers have six to eight hours of learning time per week. At the same time, party, league, and trade union cadre meetings were held in various enterprises and institutions to discuss the rational allocation of meeting time; and the trade union meetings that took up the most time were reduced. The contents of some important meetings were compiled into popular pamphlets (such as the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference, the New Record Movement), or popular propaganda outlines were compiled (propaganda for commemorative days such as "February 7th" and "March 8th") and published in employee tabloids. These pamphlets and propaganda outlines were placed in classroom learning. At the same time, some factories changed their labor organization and overcame the phenomenon of continuous overtime; some factories moved daily production forward or backward by one hour to make the time before or after work more complete, so as to facilitate workers' learning.

　　Adopting the Mass Line to Compile Literacy Textbooks

On the issue of teaching materials, the area regarded the compilation of worker literacy textbooks as one of the important preparatory tasks before carrying out the literacy movement. During the compilation, it was constantly read to the workers and revised again and again until the workers fully understood it. After printing, it was tested among the workers and revised again, and finally reviewed and issued by the government education department. With unified textbooks, the workers' learning years, progress, and other issues have standards. The literacy movement can be carried out in a planned and regular manner.

　　旅大四万余工人学文化  大部达到初小毕业程度
    【本报讯】记者蓝村报导：东北旅大地区的工人识字运动，自去年三月开始以来，由于正确掌握了群众路线的工作方法，获得巨大成绩。据去年六月统计，全区文盲工人五万零七百一十三人中，已有百分之八十参加学习。去年年底，一般文盲工人已识到六、七百字，最好的识二千多字，个别工人识到三千字。大部分工人学到能写能读——写日记，写壁报稿子，看职工小报。根据去年运动发展的情况与所得到的成绩，计划今年十月革命节前后，现有参加学习的工人，百分之八十可以完全认识一千二百字，达到初小毕业程度。
    开展文化诉苦  启发学习热情
    上述成绩的获得，一方面是由于该区生产的恢复与发展，工人的生活改善，阶级觉悟提高；另一方面，是因为该区中共党委、政府与工会的领导机关在识字运动中采取了走群众路线的领导方法，着重启发工人学习的自觉性。识字运动开始时，各企业、各工厂首先召开工人大会、文盲大会，组织文盲工人诉苦。然后将这些痛苦事实，集中起来，编成各种话剧、秧歌剧，向工人作普遍宣传。使工人们认识到自己文化程度的低落是由于日本帝国主义与中国的反动派统治压迫的恶果之一。今天工人翻了身，作了主人，如不学习文化，将不能很好地巩固胜利的成果。这样，提高了工人自觉的文化学习要求，识字运动得以蓬勃地开展起来。
    回忆学习成绩  巩固学习情绪
    去年七、八月间，该区又开展了建校运动。首先启发工人，让工人们认识按文化程度编班分级对自己学习的好处。再根据调查登记工人识字状况、考试成绩及工人自己提意见三方面的情况，编定班级，出榜公布，由工人最后评议决定。使识字运动由各种零散的识字班、组，顺利地转向正规的业余文化补习学校。工人的学习情绪得到巩固。九、十月间，在开展工人识字运动的创造模范运动中，该区又举行了“回忆运动”。让工人回忆几个月来的学习，比较自己学习前后的情况，看出自己的进步。进一步地启发他们学习的积极性，进而检查自己学习的优缺点，确定今后努力的方向。经过创造模范与回忆运动，全区工人的学习热情，猛烈增长。八个月来的学习，这一时期收获最大。十一月以后，又将回忆运动变成了每周举行一次的经常制度。
    教员积极负责  集体准备教课
    在解决教员问题上，该区也采取了思想发动的办法。首先发动各企业、工厂的职员、工会干部参加工人的文化诉苦运动。使知识分子出身的职员与干部深切了解工人不识字的痛苦，自愿来当工人的文化教师或帮助工人解决文化学习进行中的困难问题，然后由工厂的工会及行政召开知识分子会和干部会，号召职员与干部帮助工人学习。当职员们纷纷报名，自动要求当教师时，行政与工会即选择条件较好的进行正式聘请；并说服一部分文化程度太低的职员当小先生。在这样情况下面产生的教员与小先生，一般都能积极负责，坚持教学。这些教师的缺点，是文化程度不高，缺乏教学经验。该区为此采取了办训练班，组织教师研究会、集体备课，参观教学办法等，并实行“教什么，学什么”、“做什么，教什么”，以提高教员的教学能力与组织领导学习的能力。在回忆运动中，教员也对自己的教学工作进行了回忆，检讨出教学上的优缺点。一年来，教员们也有了显著的提高与进步。
    调整组织减少会议  保证工人学习时间
    此外，该区对工人学习时间与教材问题，亦获得了较好的解决。识字运动开始时曾有许多工厂不能完全保证工人的学习时间；有的工厂一星期只能学习二、三小时。主要原因是工厂生产的劳动组织未搞好与会议太多。为解决这一问题，旅大总工会曾进行仔细的调查研究，并和政府教育部门共同发出指示，要求各企业单位保证工人每周有六至八小时的学习时间。同时，又在各企业单位中召开党、团、工会干部会议，讨论合理分配会议时间；并将占时间最多的工会会议减少。对一部分重要的会议内容则编成通俗小册子（如亚、澳工会会议，新纪录运动），或编出通俗宣传提纲（“二七”、“三八”等纪念日的宣传）在职工小报上发表。将这些小册子与宣传提纲，放在课内学习。同时，有的工厂改变了劳动组织，克服了连续大加班的现象；有的工厂将每天的生产移前或推后一小时，使上班前或下班后的时间比较完整，以便利工人学习。
            采取群众路线  编定识字课本
    在教材问题上，该区在开展识字运动以前，即将编写工人识字课本作为重要的准备工作之一。编写当中，不断地念给工人听，再三修改，直至工人完全听懂为止。印出之后，又到工人中试用，再行修改，最后由政府教育部门审定发行。有了统一的课本以后，工人学习的年限、进度等问题都有了标准。识字运动能够有计划地正规进行。
