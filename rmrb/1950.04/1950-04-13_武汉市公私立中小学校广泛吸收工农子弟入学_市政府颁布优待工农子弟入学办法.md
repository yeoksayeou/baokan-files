Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 11th: Wuhan's public primary and secondary schools are broadly enrolling children of workers and peasants, with the proportion of worker and peasant students in each school increasing sharply this semester. The city's eighty-six municipal primary schools originally planned to add eighty to one hundred classes this semester, but within two weeks of the start of school, they had exceeded the original plan, adding one hundred and twenty classes. This semester, private primary schools have a total of 45,815 students, an increase of nearly 12,000 compared to last semester. Among the 13,759 new students in private primary schools, 5,418 are children of workers and 691 are children of peasants, totaling 6,109, accounting for more than 44% of the new student population. The four public secondary schools admitted a total of more than 1,200 students this semester, of which children of workers, peasants, and cadres accounted for more than 10%. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government issued measures last month to preferentially admit children of workers and peasants, stipulating that children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who are directly engaged in labor, have joined trade unions or peasant associations, and hold certificates from trade unions or peasant associations (or certificates from the district government in areas where peasant associations have not been established) are eligible for exemption from application fees and all miscellaneous fees; those with particularly difficult family circumstances can also receive subsidies for books, notebooks, and stationery. Municipal secondary schools, in addition to waiving miscellaneous fees and subsidizing books, notebooks, and stationery, can also apply for People's Scholarships. In terms of academic level, worker and peasant children with relatively poor exam scores can be admitted to remedial classes at a comparable level; students who exceed the prescribed age can also be appropriately admitted. Before the start of school this semester, all municipal primary schools universally carried out publicity and mobilization work to encourage worker and peasant children to enroll. For example, teachers from the No. 1 and No. 4 primary schools in the Hanyang Chengguan District went to the docks and factories in the district to conduct publicity; teachers and staff from the No. 2, No. 3, and No. 5 primary schools used home visits to mobilize. As a result, the five public primary schools in the district added fourteen classes; private primary schools also added eight classes; there were a total of 6,036 students, an increase of 20% compared to last semester; worker and peasant children accounted for more than 53% of the 2,832 new students. The Municipal Education Bureau called on all schools to organize student production in their spare time, on the one hand, to partially solve the financial difficulties caused by the increase in classes, and on the other hand, to cultivate students' labor concepts.

　　武汉市公私立中小学校广泛吸收工农子弟入学
    市政府颁布优待工农子弟入学办法
    【新华社汉口十一日电】武汉市公立中小学校广泛地吸收工农子女入学，本学期各校工农子弟比额激增。全市共八十六所市立小学，原计划本学期增加八十到一百个班，但开学后两周，即超过原来计划，增加到一百二十个班。本学期私立小学学生共四万五千八百十五人，较上学期增加近一万二千人。各私立小学一万三千七百五十九名新生中，工人子女即有五千四百十八人，农民子女六百九十一名，合计六千一百零九名，占新生人数百分之四十四以上。四个公立中学，本学期共录取学生一千二百余人，其中工农和干部子弟占百分之十以上。武汉市人民政府曾于上月份颁布优待工农子女入学的办法，规定凡直接从事劳动、已加入工会、农会、并持有工会或农会证明文件（在农会未成立的地区，由区政府证明）的工人和贫雇农民子女，均可受到免收报名费和全部杂费的优待；家境特别困难者，并可得到补助书籍、簿本、文具费；市立中学除全免杂费、补助书籍簿本文具费外，并可申请人民助学金。在文化程度方面，考试成绩较差的工农子女，可按程度相当的班次录取补习；并适当地吸收超过规定年龄的学生。各市立小学在本学期开学前，都普遍进行了宣传动员工作，争取工农子弟入学。如汉阳城关区第一、第四小学的教师，曾赴该区码头和工厂进行宣传；第二、第三、第五等小学教职员，则采用家庭访问方式，进行动员。结果该区五所公立小学共增加了十四个班；私立小学也增加了八个班；共有学生六千零三十六人，较上学期增加百分之二十；二千八百三十二个新生中，工农子弟占百分之五十三以上。市教育局号召各校于课余组织学生生产，一方面部分地解决各校因增加班次而发生的经济困难，同时又可培养学生的劳动观念。
