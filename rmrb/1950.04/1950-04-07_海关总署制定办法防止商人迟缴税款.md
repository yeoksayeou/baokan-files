The General Administration of Customs Formulates Measures to Prevent Merchants from Delaying Tax Payments

[Xinhua News Agency News] The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, in order to prevent merchants from delaying tax payments, ensure national treasury revenue, and ensure the implementation of the budget, has specially formulated measures for collecting late payment surcharges and issued a circular to customs offices in various regions for implementation. The measures stipulate that merchants must pay import duties and cargo taxes collected by the customs on its behalf (including dredging river fees and pier fees collected on its behalf) within three days from the day after the customs issues the tax bill (excluding Sundays and holidays). If payment is not made within the time limit, a late payment surcharge of 2% per day will be levied from the first day of the overdue period to the fifth day; a late payment surcharge of 3% per day will be levied from the sixth day to the tenth day; and a late payment surcharge of 5% per day will be levied from the eleventh day until the date of tax payment. However, every half month overdue (starting from the first day of the overdue period), the previously payable late payment surcharge should be added to the total amount of tax payable, and a 5% levy should be recalculated. The late payment surcharge collected should be deposited into the treasury as tax revenue. For example, the late payment surcharge for import duties should be deposited into the treasury as import duties. After the promulgation of these measures, any previous regulations on the collection of late payment fees by customs offices in various regions will be abolished.

　　海关总署制定办法
    防止商人迟缴税款
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府海关总署为防止商人迟缴税款，以保证国库收入，确保预算实施，特制定征收滞纳金办法，通令各地海关执行。该办法规定：商人对于进口关税及由海关代征之货物税等（其有代征浚河捐及码头捐等者亦应包括在内），概应自海关填发税单之次日起三天内缴纳（星期日及例假日除外计算），逾期不缴，自逾期之第一日起至第五日止，按日征滞纳金百分之二，自第六日起至第十日止按日征滞纳金百分之三，自第十一日起按日征滞纳金百分之五，直至完税之日为止。但其中每逾期半月（自逾期之第一日算起），应将以前应纳的滞纳金累计在应缴之税款总数内，重新按百分之五计算征收之。所收滞纳金，应作为税收解库，例如进口税之滞纳金，即作为进口税解库。自此办法公布后，各地海关原规定有征收滞纳费办法者即行废止。
