Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council issued a "Notice on Guaranteeing Reasonable Price Ratios Between Cotton, Hemp, and Grain" on the 11th of this month. The full text is as follows:

Due to the devastation of long-term war, cotton and hemp production has drastically decreased. To achieve rapid recovery, in addition to improving seeds and cultivation methods, it is very important to stipulate reasonable price ratios between cotton, hemp, and grain, so that both industry and agriculture benefit. Last year, through the efforts of the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, supply and marketing cooperatives, and governments at all levels in the North China region, a price ratio of one jin of 7/8-inch medium-grade raw cotton to eight jin of millet was guaranteed. In some places, it even reached about ten jin, establishing preliminary favorable conditions for increased cotton production this year. However, in many areas, the price ratios between cotton, hemp, and grain fluctuated greatly, failing to guarantee reasonable prices. The masses still have concerns about producing cotton and hemp, affecting increased production. Therefore, the following provisions are made:

I. Based on the comparison of harvests of cotton, hemp, and grain crops, the supply and demand and regulation of grain, transportation conditions, and the historical ratio of cotton-grain prices, the following price ratios should be guaranteed in 1950:

Cotton-Grain Price Ratio

	Region						Number of jin of grain equivalent to one jin of 7/8-inch medium-grade raw cotton
	Major cotton-producing areas in North China and Shandong		8 jin of millet
	Major cotton-producing areas such as Henan and Shaanxi			7 jin of wheat
	Major cotton-producing areas in the Yangtze River Basin			6.5 jin of rice
	Other regions (Northeast, Southwest)					To be formulated by the Greater Administrative Region People's Government or Financial Committee
Note: Provinces and regions can convert this standard into the local staple grain (such as sorghum in Shandong, sorghum rice in the Northeast).

Hemp-Grain Price Ratio

	Region and Variety				Number of jin of grain equivalent to one jin of medium-grade hemp (7 chi long fiber)
	North China Green Hemp				2 jin of millet
	Yellow Hemp and other hemp types			To be formulated independently by each region and province

II. The above price ratios are the average annual prices in the production areas and should generally not be lower than the above price ratios.

III. In terms of fiscal levies, cotton-producing areas may use cotton to offset the agricultural tax according to the above price ratios. Hemp can also be used to offset the agricultural tax in more concentrated production areas. If the market price is higher than the price ratio, the market price shall be used as the standard for collection. The burden on land planted with cotton and hemp should be assessed according to the output of grain crops, or converted into grain according to the general wholesale price at the time of harvest and sale, to determine the fixed output (i.e., what percentage discount, the specific discount rate will be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance). The burden should not be increased due to the higher income from planting cotton and hemp.

The above decisions are to be thoroughly publicized to cadres and the masses through various methods to enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for production and ensure the realization of the plan to increase the production of cotton and hemp. At present, the prices of special products (especially cotton) in some areas are too low. Financial and trade departments at all levels should immediately take measures to increase them based on the specific circumstances.

### 政务院财经委员会发布通告  保证棉麻与粮食合理比价

　　政务院财经委员会发布通告
    保证棉麻与粮食合理比价
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于本月十一日发出“关于保证棉、麻与粮食合理比价的通告”，全文如下：
    由于长期战争的破坏，棉、麻生产剧减。兹为求得迅速恢复，除改良种子和栽培方法外，规定棉、麻与粮食合理的比价，使工业农业生产两利，是一件很重要的事情。去年华北区经过华北花纱布公司、供销合作社以及各级政府的努力，保证了一斤八分之七英寸的中级皮棉与八斤小米的比价。有些地方，甚至达到了十斤左右，对今年棉花增产树立了初步有利条件。但在许多地区棉、麻与粮食比价，波动甚大，未能保证合理的价格。群众在生产棉、麻上尚存在着顾虑，影响增产。为此，特作如下之规定：
    一、根据棉、麻与粮食作物收获的比较，粮食供需和调剂状况，交通运输条件及历年棉、粮价格的比例，一九五○年应保证如下的比价：
    棉粮比价
    地区                        每斤八分之七英寸中级皮棉折粮数
    华北及山东主要棉产区              小米八斤
    河南及陕西等主要棉产区            小麦七斤
    长江流域各主要棉产区              大米六点五斤
    其他地区（东北、西南）            由大行政区人民政府或财委拟定
    注：各省区可根据这一标准换算成当地的主要粮食（如山东以高粱、东北以高粱米）。
    麻粮比价
    地区及品种                        每斤中等麻（麻皮长七尺）折粮斤数
    华北青麻                          小米二斤
    黄麻及其他麻类                    各区省自行拟定
    二、上述比价系在产地全年的平均价格，在一般情况下不得低于以上比价。
    三、在财政征收上，产棉区可照上述比价以棉花抵交公粮。麻在较集中产地亦可抵交公粮。如市价高于比价，则依市价作征收标准。种植棉麻土地负担，按种植粮作物评定产量，或按其收获时出卖季节的一般批发价格合成粮食，折成定产（即打几折，具体折率由财政部另定），不得因种植棉麻收入较多而提高负担。
    以上决定，希通过各种方法，向干部、群众深入宣传，以提高群众生产情绪，保证增产棉、麻计划的实现。目前有的地区特产（尤其是棉花）价格过低，各级财经贸易部门应即根据具体情况，设法加以提高。
