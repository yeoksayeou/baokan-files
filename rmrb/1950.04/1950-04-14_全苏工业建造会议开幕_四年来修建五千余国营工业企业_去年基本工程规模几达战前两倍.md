　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: TASS Moscow Dispatch: The All-Union Industrial Construction Conference opened here on the 10th. Participating in the conference were architects, engineers, construction workers, and administrative personnel from design and construction organizations across the country. Deputy Minister of the Soviet Union's Heavy Industry Enterprise Construction Department, Anufriyev, in his report on industrial construction and the tasks facing Soviet architects, stated that in the first four years after the war, 5,200 state-owned industrial enterprises had been built and restored, and had begun production. The scale of basic construction in 1949 nearly doubled that of pre-war levels.

　　Hundreds of architectural design organizations, the Soviet Union's most outstanding architects, and several scientific research institutes are engaged in industrial construction work. The Soviet Union has established a powerful construction industry equipped with first-rate technology. Soviet scientists' inventions of building materials and modern construction techniques are being utilized on a large scale. Soviet industrial construction work is imbued with the Stalinist spirit of caring for humanity. This is evidenced by the most favorable working conditions in all industrial enterprises.

　　全苏工业建造会议开幕
    四年来修建五千余国营工业企业  去年基本工程规模几达战前两倍
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏工业建造会议于十日在此间开幕。参加此次会议的包括全国建筑家、工程师、建筑工人以及设计与建筑组织的行政人员。苏联重工业企业建造部副部长阿努佛里耶夫在报告工业建造及苏联建筑家所面临的任务时称：在战后头四年内，已有五千二百个国营工业企业建造和修复起来，并已开始生产。一九四九年基本工程的规模，几乎达到战前两倍以上。
    数以百计的建筑设计组织、苏联最杰出的建筑家以及若干科学研究所，正从事于工业建造工作。苏联已建立了强大的配备有头等技术的建造工业。苏联科学家所发明的建筑材料以及近代化的建筑技术，正被大规模地利用着。苏联工业建造工作贯穿着斯大林式的关怀人类的思想。这可由所有工业企业中的最有利的劳动条件而得到证明。
