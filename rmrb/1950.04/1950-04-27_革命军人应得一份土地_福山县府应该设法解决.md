　　Revolutionary Soldiers Deserve a Share of Land;
    Fushan County Government Should Find a Solution

Editor:
    I am from Xiyushu Village, Zhishui District, Fushan County, Shandong Province. I joined the revolution in 1934. My family's class background is middle peasant. I haven't written home in over twenty years. After my hometown was liberated, my wife remarried. When she remarried, she handed over my three and a half thatched houses, two mu of middle-grade land, and three mu of lower-grade land to the village government for safekeeping, stating that they should be returned to me when I wrote. Last October, while recuperating at the Cadre Sanitarium of the North China Military Region, I took leave to go home and requested the village government to return my own houses and land. However, the village government replied that they could only be returned after I retired from the army and returned home. The negotiation was unsuccessful, so I returned to the original hospital for recuperation in late October. Later, I asked the hospital to inquire with the county government. It was not until March 10th of this year that I received an official reply from the Fushan County People's Government. The official letter stated: "According to Zhang Yichen's opinion, he wants to take back the land and houses to be cultivated by his brothers. We also consulted the opinions of the district and village. The person in charge of the village still said that if Zhang Yichen returns home to settle down, he will definitely have his land to cultivate and his house to live in; it is not possible to take out the land and houses and hand them over to others to manage before he returns home." May I ask, Editor, the Land Law Outline stipulates that family members of revolutionary soldiers should be allocated a share of land. I am a revolutionary soldier, and not only am I not allocated land, but my original houses and land have also been equally divided. Is this approach correct? Why is it not permissible for my own houses and land to be cultivated by my brothers? Attached is an official letter from the Fushan County Government for your reference.

    Editor's Note: Article 10, Item C of the Land Law Outline stipulates: "All personnel of the People's Liberation Army, democratic governments, and people's organizations who reside in rural areas, and their family members, shall be allocated the same land and property as the peasants." Article 11 of the Outline stipulates: "The land allocated to the people shall be issued with land ownership certificates by the government, and their rights to free management, buying and selling, and leasing under specific conditions shall be recognized..." Comrade Zhang Yichen is a revolutionary soldier and a middle peasant, and of course has the right to dispose of his own land and houses. The practice of the Xiyushu Village government is a violation of policy. The Fushan County Government should immediately order the village to return Comrade Zhang Yichen's land and houses, and we hope that the results of the handling will be notified to this newspaper by letter.

### 革命军人应得一份土地  福山县府应该设法解决

　　革命军人应得一份土地
    福山县府应该设法解决编辑同志：
    我是山东福山县芝水区西玉树庄人，一九三四年参加革命工作。我家庭的成份是中农。我二十余年没有给家中写信。在我家乡解放后，我妻改嫁了。她在改嫁时，把我家破草房三间半、中地二亩和下地三亩，交给本村村政府代为保管，说明等我去信时还我。我去年十月份在华北军区干部疗养院休养时，曾请假回家，要求村政府交还我自己的房屋土地，但村政府答复，必须等我退伍回家后才能归还。交涉无结果，我即于十月下旬返回原医院休养；其后又请医院向县府询问，直至今年三月十日始得福山县人民政府的答复公函，公函说：“据张一忱的意见，想把地和房子要出来，归其兄弟耕种。我们又征求区、村的意见，该村负责人仍云，若张一忱回乡安家，一定有他的土地种，有他的房子住；不回家先抽出土地房子交给旁人管理是不行的。”请问编辑同志，土地法大纲上规定革命军人家属应分到一份土地，而我是一革命军人，既不分给我土地，又把我原有之房地平分了，他们这种作法是否对？我个人所有之房地交给兄弟耕种为什么不行？附上福山县府公函一件，请作参考。
        华北军区干部疗养院休养员张一忱
    编者按：土地法大纲第十条丙项规定：“家居乡村的一切人民解放军、民主政府及人民团体的人员，其本人及其家属，分给与农民同样的土地及财产。”又该大纲第十一条规定：“分给人民的土地，由政府发给土地所有证，并承认其自由经营、买卖及在特定条件下出租的权利………”张一忱同志是革命军人，又是中农，当然有权利处理自己的土地房屋，而西玉树庄村政府的做法是违反政策的。福山县政府应速令该村发还张一忱同志的土地房屋，希望把处理结果函告本报。
