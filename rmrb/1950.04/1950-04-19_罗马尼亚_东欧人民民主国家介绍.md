　　Introduction to Romania - An Eastern European People's Democracy
    Ji Zhuang
    I. Geography and Revolutionary History of Romania
    Romania is a country in southeastern Europe, separated from the Balkan Peninsula by the Danube River.

    Its area is 237,000 square kilometers, with a total border length of 743 kilometers. It is bordered by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, and faces the Black Sea to the east. Its terrain is diverse, with varied climates and biology. The highest peaks of the Carpathian Mountains reach 2,500 meters. The lower reaches of the Danube River flow through southwestern Romania, bordering Yugoslavia, then through the area bordering Bulgaria, and finally dividing into three branches in northern Romania before entering the sea. The Danube River is 1,750 kilometers long within Romania, converging with various rivers and carrying large amounts of sediment into the sea, advancing 100 meters annually, affecting ship imports.

    Among minerals, petroleum is the richest, with its production and reserves accounting for the first place in Western Europe. Coupled with its proximity to the Balkans, it forms a strategically important country. Before liberation, oil exploitation rights were entirely controlled by Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and other countries. Methane reserves also rank first in Europe, followed by coal reserves and abundant mineral salts.

    The capital, Bucharest, has warmer winters than Beijing, slightly cooler summers, and mild, windless springs. The eastern part is semi-desert due to the lack of trees. Only the northern part has snow cover. The country has a population of 16 million, averaging 67 people per square kilometer. Bucharest has a population of 1.2 million.

    The first written record of Romania is by the Greek scholar Herodotus, describing the Laki tribe and its branch, the Dacians, before the Common Era. The Dacian kingdom was once conquered by the Roman Empire. Later, a strong nation from the east defeated the Roman army on its behalf. The Romanian nation includes Slavs, Dacians, and Romanian artisans. Its writing is Slavic based on Latin. Since the 13th century, it has suffered Mongol and Turkish invasions. Foreign invasions and domestic feudal lords' oppression caused popular resistance. The largest uprising was the Babur revolt in 1437. Peasants burned down landlords' houses and fled to Mount Babur. However, the peasant uprising was brutally suppressed by feudal lords using military force. In 1524, another peasant uprising broke out, and the peasant leader George was placed on a red-hot iron throne, wearing a red-hot iron crown, and burned alive. The leader of the 1784 uprising was also executed by the feudal lords using the wheel execution method. In the early 19th century, Western capitalist countries had already intervened in Romania. In 1848, a revolution also occurred in Romania, but it failed due to the collusion between feudal lords and the bourgeoisie. In 1877, with the help of Russia, Romania broke away from Turkey and became a formally independent bourgeois country.

    II. Romania Before World War II

    After World War I, due to the combination of the Romanian bourgeoisie's aggressiveness and Western imperialism's intention to establish an anti-Soviet base in Romania, Romania's territory expanded. Romanian capitalists established banks and invested in industry and commerce. Foreign banks from Britain, France, and Belgium also invested heavily in enterprises. Foreign debts were secured by domestic telegrams, salt production, and other assets, supervised by foreign countries. The exploitation of Romania by Western imperialists was no different from their exploitation in colonies. Western imperialists also participated in the internal struggles of the Romanian bourgeoisie. Britain, the United States, France, and Belgium supported the royalists, while Germany supported the fascist Iron Guard.

    The king once implemented the "New Land Law," but as a result, landlords remained landlords, and ten peasant households shared only one iron plow. Peasants suffered cruel exploitation. Workers' wages decreased, and prices increased. Bankrupt peasants moved into cities, and the number of unemployed people in cities increased daily.

    In 1918, the first organized workers' movement was launched, with printing workers in the capital organizing a strike. At that time, a young female revolutionary among the workers was Anna Pauker (now the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania). The bourgeoisie even sent troops to shoot at the workers. In 1920, there was a nationwide general strike, during which the workers put forward the political slogan of organizing trade unions. Although it failed due to a lack of contact with the broad masses and the betrayal of a part of the leadership center (the Social Democratic Party), the workers thus had the demand to establish a workers' party and receive true revolutionary education.

    The following year, in order to organize a unified Romanian Communist Party, various socialist groups convened a conference, announcing Marxism-Leninism as the foundation and joining the Communist International. This was the first congress of the Romanian Communist Party. The rulers at the time, disregarding the laws allowing the legal existence of political parties, arrested those who agreed with this view; while those who opposed it at the conference were sheltered, and these people later formed the Social Democratic Party and joined the Second International. Since then, the Romanian Communist Party has been leading the workers' movement.

    In 1931, the Fifth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party established the principles of alliance with peasants and equality for all ethnic groups in the country. After this congress, the Red Grivița incident occurred (Grivița is a railway junction near the capital). Because the government forced the expulsion of workers and the police's terror in factories, it aroused the resistance of railway workers. In January 1931, railway workers held a protest in front of the trade union hall, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Workers across the country responded. In March, representatives of railway workers, miners, and oil workers elected their own revolutionary leader, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (then a workers' representative, now the General Secretary of the Workers' Party), and decided on the method of struggle for a united workers' front.

    In January 1933, workers held a demonstration of 4,000 people at Grivița station, and the government agreed to the workers' demand to organize a workers' committee. However, two weeks later, it declared it illegal, arrested the chairman of the workers' committee, Comrade Dej, and transferred troops with wealthy peasant components from the border to fire on the families of workers gathered around the factory. The terror lasted for a month, and cars carried corpses to the crematorium overnight. The whistle of the strike kept sounding; the heroic Youth League member Vasile Roaită, despite suffering more than a dozen knife wounds, still insisted on pulling the whistle, and even tied his arm to the whistle to enable his body to drive the whistle. This time, large numbers of Communist Party organizations were destroyed, and their leaders were arrested.

    After 1933, the rulers pushed the country further into the embrace of fascism, and the darkest concentration camps gathered Romania's finest revolutionaries.

    III. Five Years of Democratic Construction and the Road to Socialism

    In April 1944, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement on Romania, announcing that the Soviet army's entry into Romania had only one purpose—to pursue and repel the defeated German army, without infringing on Romanian sovereignty, and advocating the return of Outer Transylvania to Romania. These opinions were rejected by the then Romanian Antonescu reactionary government.

    At this time, Comrade Dej, who was imprisoned, led the reorganized leadership of the Communist Party to establish Romania's united workers' front. Later, he organized the National Democratic Alliance, which included the bourgeois National Liberal Party and National Peasants' Party in addition to the Communist Party, Social Democratic Party, and Ploughmen's Front. At this time, imprisoned Communist Party members escaped one after another, organizing committees to overthrow the reactionary government and armed worker-youth teams, arresting Antonescu and his reactionary cabinet. The newly formed cabinet still had to be occupied by quite a few leaders from reactionary generals, thus generating fierce battles for leadership. It was not until 1945, under mass pressure, that King Michael (Mihai) had to invite Democratic Alliance leader Groza to form a cabinet. This new cabinet still had to cooperate with some progressive party members who had split from the bourgeoisie. However, it ultimately achieved land reform and bank nationalization. The king repeatedly obstructed the new measures. At this time, the Soviet Union returned Outer Transylvania, which it had liberated from the Germans, to Romania, and established diplomatic relations with the Romanian constitutional monarchy. As a result, Britain and the United States hurriedly established diplomatic relations with Romania; and the Romanian king cooperated with the new cabinet.

    Elections were held in 1946, and the democratic parties won, making it possible to stop inflation, reform the currency, and revive industry and agriculture. The cabinet passed the Communist Party's proposal to "improve the national economy and finance" and immediately implemented it. The defeated bourgeois reactionary forces secretly plotted to organize anti-fatherland centers abroad, but the matter was revealed, and many conspirators were arrested, including National Peasants' Party leader Maniu. After interrogation, it was proved that this conspiracy was related to American and British imperialism. From then on, the bourgeoisie could not gain a foothold in the government, and power completely shifted into the hands of the working class and peasantry. At the end of 1947, King Michael abdicated, and the Romanian people completely got rid of feudalism.

    In 1948, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party announced their merger on the basis of Marxism-Leninism to form the Workers' Party. The Workers' Party conducted education among the workers, formulated a new constitution, and organized a democratic party front. In the March parliamentary elections, only nine of the 414 seats did not belong to democratic parties. Afterward, the new parliament passed the nationalization of large industries, with only workshops with no more than ten people allowed to be privately owned. The socialist economic sector, in the national economy, occupied a decisive position in both industry and commerce. As a result of the first one-year plan, industrial products greatly increased. The canal between the Danube River and the Black Sea was excavated. In 1950, industrial products would increase by 37% compared to 1949; national income would increase by 25%; and 37.5% of state investment would be used in the socialist economic sector of state-owned enterprises as preparation for the five-year plan.

    Now the lives of the Romanian people have been improved unprecedentedly. After prices were reduced in 1949, workers' wages increased by 30%. The cultural level of the working masses has been improved, and many night schools and remedial schools have been added. The National Central Publishing House reprints various literary and scientific books. The Romanian-Soviet Friendship Association conducts huge translation work, with 4 million members, accounting for a quarter of the total population. The Workers' Party Publishing House also reprinted 40,000 copies of the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.

    In short, Romania has adopted a series of organizational methods to gradually defeat the bourgeoisie, from the establishment of the National Democratic Alliance, the Democratic Party Alliance, to the establishment of a unified workers' party. In terms of planned economy, it also started with a one-month plan, a two-month plan, a one-year plan, and then a five-year plan. From an anti-fascist democratic regime to a socialist democratic regime. All these achievements are guaranteed by the true unified proletarian party—the Workers' Party. But without the help of the Soviet Union, none of these achievements would be possible.

　　罗马尼亚——东欧人民民主国家介绍
    季庄
    一、罗马尼亚的地理与革命历史
    罗马尼亚是欧洲东南部的一个国家。她与巴尔干半岛之间，被多瑙河隔开着。
    她的面积是二十三万七千方公里。边界总长七百四十三公里。邻接苏、匈、保、南，东濒黑海。她的地势是多样性的，气候与生物亦复如此。最高的喀尔巴阡山，山峰达二千五百米。多瑙河的下流经过罗马尼亚的西南部与南斯拉夫交界处，又流经与保加利亚接界处，再穿入罗马尼亚北部分三支入海。多瑙河在罗马尼亚境内长一千七百五十公里，纳汇诸河，携带大量泥沙入海，泥沙每年向前增进一百米，影响船只进口。
    矿产中石油最富，产量及蕴藏量均占西欧第一。加上地近巴尔干，形成了战略上重要的国家。解放前石油开采权尽为英、美、法、比诸国所操纵。沼气埋藏量亦占欧洲第一。其次是煤藏及丰富的矿盐。
    京城布加勒斯特气温在冬季较北京为暖，夏季则稍凉，春季明暖无风。东部因树木缺少而形成半沙漠状态。只在北部有积雪。全国人口一千六百万，平均每方公里六十七人。布加勒斯特则有居民一百二十万。
    罗马尼亚第一次用文字记载的历史是希腊学者格那多特写的，描写纪元前的拉基族及其支系达吉人。达吉国曾一度被罗马帝国所征服。后来，由东方来的强悍民族代她击退了罗马军队。罗马尼亚民族，包括斯拉夫人，达吉人，与罗马尼亚的手工业者。她的文字是拉丁文基础上的斯拉夫语。自从十三世纪以后，遭受了蒙古与土耳其的侵略。国外的族侵略和国内封建主的压迫，引起了人民的反抗斗争。最大的一次是一四三七年的巴布尔暴动。农民在烧掉地主房屋后逃向巴布尔山去。但结果农民暴动被封建主用武力残酷镇压下去。一五二四年又爆发另一次农民暴动，农民领袖乔治被放在烧红的铁制王位上，戴着烧红的铁皇冠，活活灼死。一七八四年的暴动领袖也被封建主以车轮分尸法处死。十九世纪初叶，西方资本主义国家已插足到罗马尼亚。一八四八年罗马尼亚也曾发生革命，因封建主与资产阶级之相互勾结而失败。一八七七年，罗马尼亚得俄国之帮助，脱离了土耳其，成为形式上独立的资产阶级国家。
    二、第二次世界大战前的罗马尼亚
    第一次世界大战后，由于罗马尼亚资产阶级的侵略性和西方帝国主义打算在罗马尼亚建立反苏基地的企图相结合，罗马尼亚的领土扩大了。罗马尼亚资本家设立了银行，投资工商业。英、法、比等外资银行也纷纷向企业投资。外债以国内电报，盐产等作押，由外国监督。西方帝国主义者之剥削罗马尼亚，跟它们在殖民地进行剥削毫无二致。西方帝国主义者还参加罗马尼亚资产阶级的内部斗争。英、美、法、比支持的是保皇党，而德国则支持法西斯铁十字团。
    国王曾实行“新土地法”，但结果地主仍是地主而十个农户却只共有一把铁犁。农民受着残酷的剥削。工人工资减少，物价增高。破产后的农民走入城市，城市中失业人数日增。
    一九一八年掀起了第一次有组织的工人运动，京城的印刷工人组织了罢工，当时工人中间有一个年青的女革命者就是安娜·波克（现在是罗马尼亚的副总理兼外交部长）。资产阶级竟派兵向工人扫射。一九二○年有一次全国性的总罢工，工人提出组织职工会的政治口号，结果虽因缺乏与广大群众联系与领导中心之一部（社会民主党）叛变而失败，但工人却因此而有了建立工人政党与接受真正革命教育的要求。
    第二年，为组织统一的罗马尼亚共产党，各社会主义团体曾召开了大会，宣布以马列主义为基础，并加入共产国际。这是罗马尼亚共产党的第一次代表大会。当时的执政者不顾允许政党合法存在的法律，对赞成这一意见的人，横加逮捕；而对大会上的反对派，则予以庇护，这些人后来另组社会民主党，加入第二国际。此后，罗马尼亚共产党一直领导着工人运动。
    一九三一年，罗马尼亚共产党第五次代表大会上确定了与农民联盟及国内各民族平等的原则。在这一次代表大会后，发生了红色格里维治事件（格里维治是京城附近的铁路交叉点）。因为政府强制开除工人及工厂中警察之恐怖行为，激起了铁路工人的反抗。一九三一年一月，铁路工人在职工会大厅前举行抗议，死伤了许多人。全国各地工人纷纷响应。三月间，铁路工人与矿山、石油工人代表，选出自己的革命领导者乔治岛·德治同志（当时的工人代表现在的工人党总书记），决定了工人统一战线斗争方法。
    一九三三年一月工人在格里维治车站举行四千人的示威，政府答应了工人组织工人委员会的要求。但两周后又宣布其非法，逮捕了工人委员会主席德治同志，并从边境调来富农成分的军队向聚集在工厂周围的工人家属开枪。恐怖行动连续了一个月，汽车连夜将尸体载往火葬场去。罢工的汽笛声一直响着；英勇的青年团员瓦西里·诺特虽然身受十几处刀伤，仍然坚持拉汽笛的工作，最后甚至将自己的手臂与汽笛系在一起，使自己的身体能带动汽笛。这次有成批的共产党组织被破坏，而领袖也被捕去。
    一九三三年之后，执政者更将国家推入法西斯的怀抱中去，暗无天日的集中营里聚集了罗马尼亚最优秀的革命者们。
    三、五年来的民主建设及走向社会主义
    一九四四年四月，苏联外长莫洛托夫曾发表关于罗马尼亚的声明，宣布苏军之进入罗马尼亚，只追随一个目的——追赶与袭退败溃的德军，而不侵犯罗马尼亚主权，并主张外雪尔瓦尼亚归还罗马尼亚。这些意见，都被当时罗马尼亚安多尼斯哥（Antonescu）反动政府所拒绝。
    这时被囚在狱中的德治同志，领导了改组后的共产党领导机构，建立罗马尼亚的工人统一战线。后来又组织民族民主联盟，除共产党、社会民主党及耕者联盟外尚包括资产阶级的国家自由党与国家农民党。这时狱中的共产党员，纷纷逃出，组织推翻反动政府的委员会及工人青年武装队伍，逮捕了安多尼斯哥及其反动内阁。新组成之内阁中仍不能不被反动的将军们占据了不少的领导地位，因而产生了争夺领导权的激战。一直到一九四五年，在群众压力下，国王米海伊（Mihai）不得不请民主联盟领袖格罗查（Groza）组阁。这个新阁当时仍不得不与若干资产阶级分裂出来的进步党人合作。可是终究实现了土地改革与银行国有化。国王对于新措施数次阻挠。这时苏联将自己从德军手下解放的外雪尔瓦尼亚还给罗马尼亚，又与罗马尼亚君主立宪国建立外交关系。这样一来，英美也急忙与罗马尼亚建立外交关系；而罗马尼亚的国王才与新内阁合作。
    一九四六年举行选举，民主党派获胜，使制止通货膨胀、货币改革与复兴工业农业成为可能。内阁通过了共产党的“改善国家经济与财政”的提案，并立即付诸实行。失败了的资产阶级反动势力密谋往国外组织反祖国中心，结果事机泄露，许多阴谋者被捕，其中包括国家农民党领袖曼纽（Maniu），经审讯后证明了这种阴谋与美英帝国主义均有关系。从此资产阶级不能在政府中立足，政权完全转移入工人与农民阶级之手。一九四七年底，国王米海依逊位，罗马尼亚人民乃完全摆脱了封建主义。
    一九四八年共产党与社会民主党宣布在马列主义基础上合并为工人党。工人党在工人中进行教育，拟定新宪法，组织民主党派阵线。三月间的国会选举，四百十四席位只有九席不属于民主党派。之后新国会通过大工业国有化，只有不超过十人的作坊得为私有。社会主义经济部分，在国民经济中，不论工商业，都占决定性的地位。第一个一年计划的结果，工业产品大大增加。开凿了多瑙河与黑海间的大运河。一九五○年的工业品，将比一九四九年增加百分之三十七；国民收入将增加百分之二十五；国家投资的百分之三十七点五将用在国营企业社会主义经济部分上，作为五年计划之准备。
    现在罗马尼亚人民生活已空前改善了。一九四九年物价减低后，工人工资增加了百分之三十。劳动群众的文化水平已经提高，增设了许多夜校及补习学校。国家中央出版社翻印各种文艺科学书籍。罗苏友好协会进行巨大的翻译工作。有会员四百万人，占全人口的四分之一。工人党出版社也翻印了四万册马恩列斯的书籍。
    总之，罗马尼亚为逐步打垮资产阶级，曾采取了一系列的组织方式，从建立民族民主联盟，民主党派联盟，以至于建立统一的工人政党。在计划经济方面，也是先为一月计划，两月计划，一年计划，然后才是五年计划。从反法西斯民主化政权到社会主义民主化政权。这一切成就，是由真正的统一的无产阶级政党——工人党来保证的。但是如果没有苏联的帮助，这一切成就也是不可能的。
