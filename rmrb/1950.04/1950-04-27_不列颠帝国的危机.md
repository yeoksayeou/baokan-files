　　The Crisis of the British Empire
    By Yemashov
    Translated by Xin Nan
    Last year, the renowned British economist, historian, and prominent leader of the workers' movement, Dutt, wrote a book entitled "The Crisis of the British Empire." This article is a book review of that book from the tenth issue of "New Times." In this article, the author quotes materials from the original book to provide a very detailed explanation of the formation, development, and even decline of British imperialism, as well as the contradictions between British and American imperialism.
    The victorious struggles of the oppressed nations in the colonies and dependent countries are relentlessly placing the collapse of the colonial empire on the agenda. The majority of the world's population, scattered across the Asian continent and the Pacific and Indian Oceans, who are still oppressed and brutally exploited by imperialism, are embarking on the sure path to liberation. It is clear from this how important the issue of the colonial world is, being closely linked to the problems encountered by progressive forces in the West.
    The entire colonial system is facing bankruptcy. The crisis of the British Empire is an inevitable feature of the current general crisis of capitalism.
    Until 1880, Britain firmly maintained its position as the "workshop of the world," the largest industrial nation on Earth. By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States and Germany began to rival it. But Britain still maintained its leading position as an exporter of industrial goods. It was the first to export capital, while expanding its colonial occupation.
    In the sixteen years from 1884 to 1900, Britain added 3.7 million square miles of colonies. By 1914, the British Empire possessed an area of 12.7 million square miles, of which the United Kingdom occupied 121,000 square miles (less than one percent!), the so-called self-governing dominions occupied 7 million square miles, and the colonies and dependent kingdoms occupied 5.6 million square miles, that is to say, 46 percent of the area of the United Kingdom.
    At that time, the total population of the empire was 431 million, of which the white self-governing population of Britain and the dominions totaled 60 million, that is to say, less than one-seventh. Thus, it can be seen that most of the colonial empire was seized after 1884. World War I obtained another 1.5 million square miles. On the eve of World War II, the British Empire and its dependencies, colonies, and protectorates occupied a quarter of the Earth's surface, with a quarter of the world's population. This was the region where colonial exploitation was carried out using imperialist methods.
    Between 1850 and 1880, British overseas investment increased fivefold—from 200 million pounds to 1 billion pounds; in 1905 it doubled again, reaching 2 billion pounds; and in 1913 it doubled again, reaching nearly 4 billion pounds. In 1899, Britain's total income from foreign trade amounted to 18 million pounds, while its income from foreign investment was 90 million pounds—five times the amount obtained from foreign trade. In 1912, the income from foreign investment was 176 million pounds, and in 1929 it reached 250 million pounds.
    Britain was the first to embark on the path of imperialism and imperialist parasitism. This inevitably had an impact on its domestic situation, particularly manifested in the relative backwardness of British industrial development and the profound deterioration of agriculture, and finally in the corruption of the upper strata of the British working class, who were bought off by the imperialist bourgeoisie with a portion of the enormous super-profits they extracted from the colonies. Imperialism produced a special "British form" of opportunism and reformism—trade unionism, from which the British working class has not been able to break free even to this day.
    Dutt recalls that Engels had already predicted as early as 1885 that the labor aristocracy would lose their privileged position with the collapse of Britain's manufacturing monopoly. When Britain began to embark on the road of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, this process of collapse was prolonged because British capital relied on its colonial monopolies to first obtain huge profits from foreign investment. However, today, Britain is no longer the largest exporter of capital and commodities. It has handed over that top spot to its biggest competitor, the United States, and Engels' prediction has been fully realized.
    At the same time, the parasitism of British imperialism continues to affect the economy of the United Kingdom. In the past five or six decades, the British economy has seriously lagged behind the United States and Germany, and has also fallen behind many other countries in terms of technical equipment and electricity resources. The "strength" of British capital is almost entirely built on the cruel exploitation of the empire's colonies and other countries. Therefore, every serious blow from the new struggle for liberation by the colonial people is hitting the vital parts of British capitalism, undermining the main pillar of the British ruling class, and also destroying the opportunism in the British labor movement.
    The process of disintegration and decline is proceeding relentlessly and stubbornly. The British Empire is the prey selected by American imperialism. The contradictions between Britain and America and the overblown but actually mutually hostile Anglo-American "cooperation" are destroying the foundations of British world hegemony, while the liberation struggles of the colonial peoples are also destroying it. Today's British capitalism can no longer, as before, compensate for the reduced foreign trade by increasing foreign investment, maritime transport, and other invisible exports. On the eve of World War I, nearly one-fifth of the British population could not be paid for by goods exports. On the eve of World War II, this difference doubled (that is, two-fifths of the population could not be paid for by the export of goods, but by other sources). The import surplus increased from 30 million pounds in 1855-59 to 134 million pounds in 1913, 302 million pounds in 1938, and 438 million pounds in 1947.
    For such an import surplus, even the huge income from foreign investment can no longer prevent the rapid deterioration of Britain's international balance of payments. On the eve of World War II (1938), the international balance of payments deficit reached 70 million pounds. Eight years later, the deficit increased to 380 million pounds, and a year later it increased to 630 million pounds. Although "emergency measures" have been taken to reduce the deficit, it remains, as Dutt says, "a long-standing and insoluble difficulty of British capitalism today." He says this explains why the continuous accumulation of overseas capital has turned into a continuous disappearance; overseas assets have begun to decrease and are being transferred into the hands of Americans. This is the root cause of the "difficulties" of British imperialism, and the basic root of Anglo-American conflict.
    For a long time, British monopoly capital has been trying to find a way out by continuing to expand its overseas position and thereby increasing its parasitic super-income. But this inevitably exacerbates the economic disintegration and decline of the imperial center—Britain itself.
    In particular, the British coal mining industry has become "almost stagnant"; textile machinery has become obsolete; the steel industry has hardly made any fundamental improvements for nearly thirty years (1886-1913), during which time the United States and Germany caught up with and surpassed Britain in steel production. Industrial output declines year by year. Coal production fell from 287 million tons in 1913 to 230 million tons before the war in 1938, during which time the number of coal pits decreased from 3,267 to 2,125. In the textile industry, 14 million spindles were destroyed in the fifteen years from 1920 to 1935. One-third of British shipyards were closed, and in the twenty years from 1918 to 1938, British shipbuilding volume decreased from 3 million tons to 2 million tons per year.
    New investment in basic industries has been declining. In the ten years from 1904 to 1913 and the five years from 1924 to 1928, investment in basic industries fell by half, from 41.7 million pounds to 21.4 million pounds, while investment in "industries" such as brewing more than doubled (from 6 million pounds to 15 million pounds), and in hotels, theaters, etc. almost tripled (from 7.1 million pounds to 20.4 million pounds).
    The proportion of the population engaged in production has also declined. In 1851, 23 percent of the salaried employed population was engaged in basic industries, while in 1929 only 13.6 percent was. On the other hand, the number of people engaged in commercial and financial institutions, distribution, offices, and other "services" has greatly increased. In 1937, The Economist weekly was not without reason to declare that foreign investment was Britain's "largest industry."
    The growth of parasitism is also manifested in the continued increase in military spending during peacetime, which is the result of monopoly capital intensifying its imperialist policies. Britain's military spending almost doubled between 1875 and 1897—from 24 million pounds to 40 million pounds. In 1913, military spending increased to 86 million pounds, 115 million pounds in 1929, 263 million pounds in 1938, and 800 million pounds in 1949. In fact, this expenditure is even higher, but even these official figures are enough to illustrate the point. Military spending in 1949 was thirty times greater than at the beginning of the imperialist expansion phase, nineteen times greater than on the eve of the Boer War, nine times greater than on the eve of World War I, six times greater than twenty years ago, and three times greater than on the eve of World War II.
    As a result of assuming the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, Britain's military spending is continuing to increase.
    The crisis of the colonial system has become particularly acute since World War II. The war weakened the aging Western European powers. In order to recover, their ruling classes had to request assistance from American capital. The price for this assistance was very high—that is, the Western European countries actually succumbed to the United States, and at the same time, several large colonial empires were at the beck and call of the dollar. All of this clearly illustrates the unevenness of the development of the imperialist stage. But another factor is the intensification of the Anglo-American conflict.
    British imperialism is suffering from anemia caused by the current inadequacy of British production; while American imperialism is suffering from a fatal stroke caused by overproduction. American imperialism, swollen with the blood of two world wars, wants to seize world hegemony, seize the position of the world's exclusive exploiter, and establish its own colonial empire. Naturally, the first thing American capital did was to infringe upon the British Empire. The United States has now deprived Britain of its past advantages in world trade, shipping, banking, foreign investment, naval armament, and colonial policy.
    American monopolists profited the most from World War II, greatly increasing their production capacity, and their foreign investment expanded even more. At the end of World War II, American capital controlled 60 percent of the production capacity of the capitalist world and 73 percent of the total investment of the capitalist world. In 1938, American capital exports accounted for 13.5 percent of global capital exports, and Britain accounted for 10.3 percent. By 1947, the United States had risen to 32.6 percent, while Britain had not increased at all. Great Britain has lost its leadership position in the shipping industry. Before the war, the tonnage of British merchant ships was 18 million tons, while the United States was 15 million tons. By 1947, the United States had increased to 32.4 million tons, while Britain had only 17.8 million tons.
    The United States also ranks first in naval power. Before the war, the total tonnage of the British Navy was 1.2 million tons, while the United States was 1 million tons; in 1947, the total tonnage of the British Navy was 1.5 million tons, while the United States was 3.8 million tons.
    But the most obvious thing is the increase in American foreign investment—from $11 billion in 1938 to $4.8 billion in 1947. If we include various government loans and direct and indirect investments, then American foreign investment is estimated to be about $30 billion. The largest portion of American investment is invested in the countries of the British Empire, where the dollar defeated the pound. Dutt illustrated this with figures on American exports to the countries within the British Empire.
    Between 1939 and 1948, the value of British exports to Canada increased less than threefold, while the United States increased fourfold; British exports to India increased fourfold, while the United States increased sevenfold; British exports to Malaya increased less than threefold, while the United States increased eightfold.
    The intrusion of American capital into the colonies is not limited to countries belonging to the British Empire. For example, American rubber plantations in Indonesia have increased from 100,000 acres before the war to 1 million acres, or one-ninth of the entire rubber plantation area. The important significance of this is that even in Indonesia, Britain's position has been encroached upon by American capital.
    British monopoly capitalists believe that the only way they can preserve their empire is to recognize American suzerainty and control, and endure all the consequences arising from this dependent status. Of course, this occurred after a sharp struggle, demonstrating the full incompatibility between Anglo-American conflicting interests. But the fact remains that British monopoly capitalists want to maintain their parasitic interests, they have no other choice but to recognize their own weakness and accept their position as a second-class partner in the Anglo-American imperialist bloc.
    The Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western Union, the Military Assistance Program—all of these are not only manifestations of American imperialism's aggression and pursuit of world domination, but also smoke screens for the feverish establishment of an "American colonial empire." The British Empire owns 14 million square miles of land and colonies with a population of 550 million. The American imperialists are mainly attracted by British colonies.
    But these plans are not feasible, because the United States cannot occupy the position that Britain occupied in the 19th century. First of all, capitalism is not as good as it was then; the position of capitalism has been shaken and is precarious. Secondly, when Britain was the world's largest creditor, it was also the world's largest importing country, and was content with the decline of its domestic industry and agriculture. In contrast, the United States applies all methods to expand exports and restrict imports, including imports from Marshallized countries. The cost of American expansion is the destruction of the entire capitalist world.
    Colonial imperialists must disguise themselves, which explains why dominion status was given to India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and "independence" was promised to Burma. British imperialism has made certain concessions to the local bourgeoisie and landlords, bribing them, in order to use them to oppose the ravaged and exploited masses who are fighting for freedom and independence.
    Anglo-American imperialists are trying their best to pull the reactionary forces of the colonies into their aggressive front. At the same time, they shamelessly boast about the "development" of the colonies to deceive the colonial countries and the working people of Britain. The "British Colonial Development and Welfare Act" of 1940 is one example.
    Over the past nine years, the total amount spent under the "Colonial Development" plan is £25,609,180, distributed among 47 colonial territories with a total population of 68 million. This equals seven shillings and four pence per person in nine years, or an average of less than ten pence per person per year. On the other hand, in these nine years, British monopoly capitalists have plundered more than 600 million pounds of goods and labor from these colonies, or 24 times the expenditure under the "Colonial Development" plan. In 1948, a single combine—the United Africa Company—made a profit of 25 million pounds, which is equal to the total amount allocated by the generous British government for the "development" of these colonies.
    The Labor government, in an attempt to prevent the empire from collapsing under the blows of the liberation movement of oppressed nations, is continuing the tradition of the Conservative Party. Directly and indirectly, it is engaging in uninterrupted colonial wars, and supporting anti-people groups and "punitive" armies in the colonies of other powers. It is jointly organizing an aggressive bloc against the new China with American imperialism, and is attempting to lure India to undertake the main burden of aggressive military adventures in Asia. Since British imperialism is not capable of undertaking these tasks alone, it must collude with American imperialism, and as a result, it must agree to the demands of American imperialism, eventually making Britain itself an instrument of American policy.
    The crime of the British Labor bureaucrats is that they are trying to make the British proletariat an accomplice in all aggressive conspiracies in Asia and Europe. Therefore, the imperialist Labor lackeys not only hinder the liberation of the colonies from imperialist oppression, but also hinder the liberation of British workers from the oppression of their own and American exploiters.
    Dutt points out that the liberation of the colonies is as important to the British people as it is to the people of the colonies, because only when the slave chains imposed on the colonial people by capitalist monopoly capitalists are broken, can the rule of monopoly capital in Britain itself be overthrown.
    Dutt correctly contrasts the Soviet Union's national policy with the colonial policy of imperialism and its Labor agents. He cited facts and figures to illustrate the situation of the masses of people in India and Soviet Tajikistan. He compared the cultural level of the two countries. In India, the number of illiterates in 1911 accounted for 94 percent of the population, and in 1931 it accounted for 92 percent, a decrease of only 2 percent. In Tajikistan, the number of illiterates in 1913 accounted for 99.5 percent of the population, while in 1939 it accounted for only 28.3 percent, a decrease of 71 percent.
    Dutt continues, "Let us compare it with Nigeria." This comparison is indeed an indictment of the crimes of British imperialism. After eighty years of British rule, Nigeria had one hospital bed for every 3,700 residents in 1947. In Tajikistan, in 1914, under the rule of Tsarist colonialism, there was one hospital bed for every 13,000 residents, but by 1939, only twenty years after the establishment of the Soviet system, there was one hospital bed for every 408 residents. In 1917, there was one doctor for every 135,000 residents in Nigeria, and it is still the same number today. In 1914, there was one doctor for every 100,000 residents in Tajikistan, and in 1939 there was one doctor for every 3,400 people. Dutt's latest figures are up to 1939. In the following ten years, Soviet Tajikistan has made great strides forward in both public health and culture.
    The imperial crisis of Britain is intensifying, and no matter what the policies of the Labor Party, no matter what the conspiracies of the Anglo-American colonialists, they cannot save the ultimate demise of the imperialist colonial system.

　　不列颠帝国的危机
    耶马萧夫原著
    新南节译
    英国著名的经济学家、历史学者和卓越的工人运动领袖杜德去年写了一本书，《不列颠帝国的危机》。本文是第十期《新时代》对该书的一篇书评。作者在本文中引述原书的材料，对英国帝国主义的形成、发展以致衰退；和英美帝国主义之间的矛盾，作了很详尽的说明。
    殖民地及附属国的被压迫民族的胜利斗争正无情地把殖民帝国的崩溃放到日程上去，直到现在还被帝国主义压迫和被残酷剥削的，散布在亚洲大陆和太平洋、印度洋的占地球上大多数的居民正走上解放的确定的道路。很明显，从这可以看出与西方进步力量所遭遇的问题密切关连着的殖民地世界问题是如何重要。
    整个殖民地制度面临着破产。不列颠帝国的危机乃是目前资本主义总危机中的一个无可避免的特点。
    直到一八八○年，英国仍稳固地保持着“世界的工厂”的地位，是地球上最大的工业国。到二十世纪初叶，美国和德国开始与她并驾齐驱。但英国仍然保持了工业品出口国的首位。她是头一个输出资本，同时扩大她的殖民地占领。
    从一八八四年到一九○○年的十六年中，英国增加了殖民地三百七十万平方英里。到一九一四年为止，不列颠帝国拥有面积一千二百七十万平方英里，其中联合王国占十二万一千平方英里（还不到百分之一！），所谓自治的自治领占七百万平方英里，而殖民地和附属王国则占五百六十万平方英里，即是说占联合王国面积百分之四十六。
    当时帝国人口总数四亿三千一百万人，其中英国和自治领的白种自治人口总数为六千万人，即是说占七分之一弱。这样就可以看到，殖民帝国的大部都是一八八四年以后攫取的。第一次世界大战又获得另外的一百五十万平方英里，第二次世界大战前夕，不列颠帝国及其附属国、殖民地及保护国占据地球表面土地的四分之一，共有世界人口的四分之一，这就是应用帝国主义方法以从事殖民地剥削的地域。
    一八五○年到一八八○年间英国在海外投资增加了五倍——由两亿英镑增到十亿英镑；一九○五年又增加了一倍，而达到二十亿英镑；一九一三年又再增一倍，几达四十亿英镑了。一八九九年，英国对外贸易的全部收入数达一千八百万英镑，而其对外投资的收入则有九千万英镑——五倍于对外贸易所获得的数目。一九一二年对外投资的收入为一亿七千六百万英镑，而一九二九年则达两亿五千万英镑了。
    不列颠是第一个走上帝国主义及帝国主义寄生性的道路的，这一点必然对其国内局势发生了影响，特别表现在英国工业发展之某些落后性以及农业之深刻恶化，而最后是表现于英国工人阶级的上层分子之腐败，他们受帝国主义资产阶级以其从殖民地剥削来的庞大的超额利润的一部分所收买。帝国主义产生出特殊的“英国形式”的机会主义和改良主义——工会主义，这种工会主义甚至直到今天，英国的工人阶级还不能够摆脱。
    杜德想起恩格斯早在一八八五年就已经预言工人贵族将会随着英国制造业垄断之崩溃而失掉他们的特权地位。当十九世纪末叶不列颠开始走上帝国主义的道路时，由于英国资本靠着她的殖民地的垄断首先从对外投资取得了巨额的利润，这个崩溃的过程被延长了。然而在今天，英国不再是最大的输出资本和商品的国家，她已经把那第一把交椅让给她最大的竞争者美国，恩格斯的预言却完全实现了。
    同时，英国帝国主义的寄生性对联合王国之经济继续发生影响。英国经济在过去五、六十年里严重地远落在美国和德国之后，而在技术装备及电力资源上也落在其他许多国家之后。英国资本的“力量”是几乎完全建筑在对帝国的殖民地和其他国家的惨酷剥削之上。所以每一次新的殖民地人民解放斗争的严重打击正都打在英国资本主义的要害上，并掘倒英国统治阶级的主要支柱，而同时也摧毁着英国劳工运动中的机会主义。
    崩解与衰落的过程，无情地和顽强地进行着。不列颠帝国是美国帝国主义所选定的猎物。英美之间的矛盾与过分吹嘘而实际是互相敌对的英美“合作”正在摧毁着英国世界霸权的基础，而殖民地民族的解放斗争亦在摧毁着它。今天的英国资本主义已不能再像从前一样，以增加对外投资、海上运输和其他无形输出的收入来弥补已经减少了的对外贸易。第一次世界大战前夕，近五分之一的英国人口就不能用货物出口来支付。第二次世界大战前夕，这个差额增加了一倍（即人口的五分之二不能用货物的出口而是以其他的来源支付了）。入超从一八五五至五九年的三千万英镑增加到一九一三年的一亿三千四百万英镑，一九三八年的三亿零二百万英镑和一九四七年的四亿三千八百万英镑。
    对这样的一个入超，甚至国外投资的巨额收入也再不能阻止英国国际收支的急激恶化。在第二次世界大战的前夕（一九三八年）国际收支赤字达七千万英镑。八年后赤字增加到三亿八千万英镑，而再过一年又增到六亿三千万英镑了。虽然已采取“紧急措施”来削减赤字，但是正像杜德所说的，它仍然是“今天英国资本主义的一个长期存在着的不能解决的困难。”他说，这说明了为什么从前的海外资本继续不断的累积已变为不断的消失；海外资产已开始减少，并转到美国人的手里。这就是英帝国主义的“困难”的根本原因，也是英美冲突的基本根源。
    很久以来英国独占资本就以继续扩张其在海外的地位，并因而增加其寄生性超额收入来找出路。但是这就不可避免地加剧了帝国中心——英国本身的经济崩解与衰落。
    特别是英国的煤矿工业已变成“几近于停顿”；纺织机器已变得陈旧不堪；钢铁工业差不多三十年来（一八八六至一九一三）就没有基本的改进，在此时期美国和德国在钢铁生产上赶上了并且超过了英国。工业产量一年比一年下降。煤的生产从一九一三年的二亿八千七百万吨降到战前一九三八年的二亿三千万吨，在此时期中煤坑的数目从三、二六七个减到二、一二五个。在纺织工业中，从一九二○至三五年的十五年中，毁掉了一千四百万个纱锭。英国的造船厂停闭了三分之一，从一九一八到三八年的二十年中英国的造船量从每年三百万吨减到二百万吨。
    基本工业中的新投资一直下降。在一九○四至一三的十年中和一九二四至二八的五年中，基本工业的投资降落一半，自四千一百七十万英镑跌到二千一百四十万英镑，而同时对像酿造业这样的“工业”的投资却增加了一倍多（从六百万英镑增到一千五百万英镑），而对旅馆、戏院等等差不多增加了两倍（从七百一十万英镑增到二千零四十万英镑）。
    从事于生产的人口的比例也同样地下降了。一八五一年，受薪的就业人口的百分之二十三是从事于基本工业，而在一九二九年却只有百分之十三点六。另一方面，从事于商业和金融机关、分配业、办事处和其他“服务”的人数却大大增加。一九三七年《经济学者》周刊不是毫无道理地宣称，对外投资是英国的“最大的一种工业。”
    寄生性的增长，也表现为在和平时期的军费的继续增加，这是垄断资本加紧施行帝国主义政策的结果。英国的军备支出在一八七五年到一八九七年之间几乎增加了一倍——从二千四百万英镑增到四千万英镑。一九一三年军备支出增到八千六百万英镑，一九二九年一亿一千五百万英镑，一九三八年二亿六千三百万英镑，一九四九年八亿英镑。实际上这种支出还要高些，但是甚至这些官方数字已够说明的了。一九四九年的军费比帝国主义扩张阶段开始时大三十倍，比布耳战争前夕大十九倍，比第一次世界大战前夕大九倍，比二十年前大六倍，比第二次世界大战前夕大三倍。
    由于承担了北大西洋集团和西欧联盟的义务的结果，英国的军费是在继续增加着。
    殖民制度的危机，自第二次世界大战以来已变得特别尖锐。战争削弱了衰老的西欧列强。为了恢复，它们的统治阶级必须请求美国资本的援助。而换取这种援助的代价是非常的高昂——即西欧各国实际向美国屈服，同时几个大的殖民帝国听命于美元。这一切明显地说明了帝国主义阶段发展的不平衡性。但是另一个因素却是英美冲突的剧烈。
    不列颠帝国主义正犯着因现时英国生产量不足而引起的贫血症；而美帝国主义却犯着因生产过剩所引起的致命的中风症。用两次大战的鲜血饱胀起来的美帝国主义要夺取世界霸权，夺取世界独占剥削者的地位，并要建立自己的殖民帝国。自然地，美国资本第一桩事就是侵犯不列颠帝国。现在美国已经剥夺了英国过去在世界贸易、航运、银行、对外投资、海军军备及殖民地政策中的优势地位。
    美国独占者从第二次世界大战获利最多，大大增加其生产能力，而其对外投资扩大尤甚。第二次世界大战末期，美国资本控制了资本主义世界的生产能力的百分之六十及资本主义世界总投资的百分之七十三。一九三八年，美国资本输出占全世界资本输出的百分之十三点五，不列颠占百分之十点三，到一九四七年，美国上升至百分之三十二点六，而不列颠却一无增加。大不列颠已丧失其在航运业中的领导地位。战前英国的商船吨数是一千八百万吨，而美国的是一千五百万吨，到一九四七年美国增加到三千二百四十万吨而英国只有一千七百八十万吨。
    美国在海军军力上也占首位。战前英国海军总吨数一百二十万吨，美国一百万吨；一九四七年英国海军吨数总共一百五十万吨，而美国为三百八十万吨。
    但是最显明的事情是美国对外投资的增加——从一九三八年的十一亿美元，增加到一九四七年的四十八亿美元。假若我们把各种政府贷款及直接与间接投资一并计算，那末美国对外投资估计约达三百亿美元。最大部分的美国投资投于不列颠帝国的各国中，在那里美元战败了英镑。杜德用美国对不列颠帝国内各国的输出数字说明了这一点。
    在一九三九年到一九四八年之间，英国向加拿大的输出价值增加不到三倍，而美国则增加四倍；英国向印度的输出增加四倍，而美国增加七倍；英国向马来亚的输出增加不到三倍，而美国则增加八倍。
    美国资本向殖民地的侵入，并不局限于不列颠帝国所属的国家。例如，美国在印度尼西亚的橡胶园，已自战前的十万英亩增加到一百万英亩，或者说整个橡胶园面积的九分之一。这种事情的重要意义就是说，即令在印度尼西亚，英国的地位也被美国资本所侵夺了。
    英国的独占资本家们相信他们能够保全他们的帝国的唯一方法是承认美国的宗主权及控制，并忍受由这种倚赖地位而产生的一切结果。当然，这是经过了尖锐的斗争后才发生的，表现出英美对立利益间充分的不调和性。但事实还是，英国独占资本家想要保持它的寄生的利益，它只有承认自己的弱点而接受它在英美帝国主义集团中处于二等伙伴的地位，它没有其他的选择。
    马歇尔计划，杜鲁门主义，北大西集洋团，西方联盟，军事援助计划——所有这些不仅是美帝国主义的侵略及争取世界统治的表现，也是热狂建立“美利坚殖民帝国”的烟幕。英国拥有一千四百万方英里土地，五亿五千万人口的殖民地，美帝国主义者主要是被英国殖民地所吸引。
    但这些计划是不能实现的，因为美国不能占居英国在十九世纪所处的地位。首先，资本主义已不如当时；资本主义的地位已经动摇，而且危殆了。其次，当英国是世界上最大的债主的时候，她同时亦是世界上最大的进口国家，而且安于本国工业与农业的衰退。相反地，美国却应用一切方法扩展输出，并且限制输入，包括从马歇尔化国家的输入在内。美国扩张的代价是整个资本主义世界的毁灭。
    殖民帝国主义者必须伪装，这就说明了为什么给印度、巴基斯坦、及锡兰以自治领的地位，并许缅甸“独立”。英帝国主义对当地资产阶级及地主作了某些让步，贿赂他们，为的是利用他们来反对那些为自由与独立而战的被蹂躏与被剥削的人民大众。
    英美帝国主义者竭力将殖民地的反动势力拉入其侵略阵线。同时，他们无耻地夸谈什么殖民地的“开发”，来欺骗殖民地国家与英国本国的劳动人民。一九四○年的“英国殖民地开发及福利法案”，就是一个例子。
    过去九年之中，在“殖民地开发”计划下所花费的总数是二五、六○九、一八○英镑，分配于共有六千八百万人口的四十七个殖民领土上。等于在九年中每个人七先令四便士，或是平均每年每人还不到十便士。另一方面，在这九年之中，英国独占资本家却从这些殖民地掠夺了超过六亿英镑的货物与劳役，或是二十四倍于“殖民地开发”计划下的支出。在一九四八年，单是一个康拜因——联合非洲公司——即获利二千五百万英镑，就等于慷慨的英国政府对“开发”这些殖民地所拨定的总数。
    工党政府为企图防止帝国因受被压迫民族的解放运动之打击而崩溃，乃继续着保守党的传统。直接和间接地，它正从事于不间断的殖民地战争，并支持其他列强的殖民地中的反人民集团和“讨伐”军。它正与美国帝国主义联合组织一个反对新中国的侵略集团，并试图引诱印度承担在亚洲进行侵略军事冒险的主要负担。既然英国帝国主义没有能力来单独负起这些任务，它就必得和美帝勾结起来，结果就要同意美帝的要求，终使英国本身成了美国政策的工具。
    英国工党官僚们的罪恶，在于他们试图使英国无产阶级成为在亚洲和欧洲的一切侵略阴谋的从犯。因此，帝国主义的工党走狗们，不但阻碍了殖民地摆脱帝国主义压迫之解放，并且阻碍了英国工人摆脱其本国的和美国的剥削者的压迫之解放。
    杜德指出，殖民地的解放对于英国人民犹如对殖民地的人民同样重要，因为只有资本主义独占资本家加于殖民地人民的奴隶锁链被打断，在英国本国的独占资本的统治才可能被推翻。
    杜德正确地把苏联的民族政策和帝国主义及其工党代理人的殖民地政策对照起来。他引证了事实和数字以说明印度和苏维埃塔吉克斯坦的人民群众的情况。他比较了两国的文化水平。在印度，一九一一年的文盲人数占人口的百分之九十四，一九三一年占百分之九十二，只减少了百分之二。在塔吉克斯坦，一九一三年文盲人数占人口的百分之九十九点五，而一九三九年仅占百分之二十八点三，减少了百分之七十一。
    杜德继续写道，“让我们把它与奈几里亚相比”。这个比较确实是对英国帝国主义罪行的一个诉状。奈几里亚经过了英国八十年的统治，一九四七年时每三千七百居民有一个病床。在塔吉克斯坦，一九一四年，在沙皇殖民地统治下，每一万三千居民有一个病床，但至一九三九年，距建立苏维埃制度仅二十年之后，每四百零八个居民就有一个病床。一九一七年在奈几里亚，每十三万五千居民有一个医生，而到现在还是这个数字。一九一四年在塔吉克斯坦每十万居民有医生一人，而在一九三九年每三千四百人就有一个医生。杜德最新的数字是到一九三九年。在以后的十年中，苏维埃塔吉克斯坦在公共卫生和文化两方面，都已大步地向前跨进了。
    不列颠的帝国危机已日益尖锐化，不论工党的什么政策，不论英美殖民地者用什么阴谋，都不能拯救帝国主义殖民地制度之最终灭亡。
