Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 23rd – TASS reports: The French Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace protests with great indignation the renewed attacks by French reactionaries, at the instigation of the United States, against Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress and High Commissioner of the French Atomic Energy Commission. The Association's Standing Committee issued a declaration stating: "As soon as scientist Joliot-Curie reiterated his determination to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes and his disagreement with a policy of aggressive war against the Soviet Union, the warmongers in the United States immediately launched a campaign of humiliation and threats against him." The Standing Committee of the Association announced its full support for Joliot-Curie's statement and guaranteed to support him. The Standing Committee called on all peace advocates to redouble their efforts to oppose the preparation of new wars and to strengthen the struggle to ban the atomic bomb.
　　
It is reported that since the World Peace Congress was held last year, reactionary French newspapers and members of parliament have clamored for the removal of Joliot-Curie from his current position as Atomic Energy Commissioner. However, under the pressure of the angry protests of the French people, the French government has not dared to take action.

　　法争和平自由战士协会抗议法反动派迫害居里
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国争和平自由战士协会以极大的义愤抗议法国反动分子在美国授意下对世界拥护和平大会主席法国原子能委员会高级专员约里奥——居里的再度攻击。协会常务委员会为此特发表宣言称：“当科学家约里奥——居里刚刚重申决定把原子能使用于和平目的及不同意对苏联进行侵略战争的政策之后，美国的战争贩子们就立即发动了对他的凌辱与威胁运动”。协会常委会宣布全力支持约里奥——居里的声明，并保证支援他。常委会号召一切和平拥护者加倍努力反对新战争的准备，加强禁用原子弹的斗争。
    按在自去年世界拥护和平大会举行以后，法国的反动的报纸与议员即曾大肆叫嚣，要求免除约里奥——居里现任原子能专员的职位。但在法国人民愤怒抗议的压力下，法国政府迄未敢采取行动。
