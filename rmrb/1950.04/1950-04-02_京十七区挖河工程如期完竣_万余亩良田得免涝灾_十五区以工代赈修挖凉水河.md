　　Capital's Seventeenth District River Dredging Project Completed on Schedule
    Over Ten Thousand Mu of Farmland Spared from Flooding   
    Fifteenth District Uses Work Relief to Repair and Dredge Liangshui River
    [Our Newspaper] The three river dredging projects in the Seventeenth District of the Capital's suburbs have been completed on schedule. The projects are: a section of the moat outside Deshengmen, 1,923 meters long; the Xiba River, 8 li long; and the Han River, 26 li long. The projects started on the 11th of last month and were completed successively on the 25th; a total of more than 3,100 farmers, small vendors, etc. were organized to participate in the work. The farmers deeply realized that this was beneficial to them. Wang Liang, a poor peasant from Yudi Village, said: "My two mu of land will not be flooded." Liu Dequan from Donghuqu Village said: "Only when the Communist Party comes can we dredge the river. The Kuomintang wouldn't care about this." The implementation of a contract-based segmented system in the assignment of tasks fully leveraged the power of collective labor, which was an important factor in the completion of the river dredging project on schedule. After the moat section is repaired, it can accelerate the water flow, reduce mosquitoes, and prevent diseases. After the Xiba River and Han River are repaired, more than 10,978 mu of farmland can be spared from flooding.

    [Our Newspaper] The Liangshui River, which has been overflowing for sixty years without repair, will be conquered by the working people of the Fifteenth District in the capital's suburbs, which will be beneficial to agricultural production. This river has been breaching its banks frequently due to years of disrepair. Last summer, due to continuous rain, the river water overflowed, causing a severe flood on more than 100 hectares of land in over ten villages along the river, including Wanquansi. The masses urgently demanded river dredging. The district government accepted the opinions of the masses and, in order to realize the plan to increase production by 10% and to take care of the disaster situation of the local people, specially allocated 50,000 jin of millet to provide work relief for dredging and repairing the river channel, widening and deepening it. The project officially started on March 29th. A total of 1,182 organized laborers from sixteen villages arrived, completing one-third of the entire river project on that day, totaling 1,639 cubic meters of earthwork. Each cubic meter of earthwork was compensated with eight jin of corn, and each person earned up to nineteen jin of corn. The enthusiasm of the masses was very high. More than eighty people from Wanquansi Village volunteered their labor. Many also donated firewood to cook mung bean soup.

　　京十七区挖河工程如期完竣
    万余亩良田得免涝灾   
    十五区以工代赈修挖凉水河
    【本报讯】京郊十七区三项挖河工程如期完成。该工程为：德胜门外护城河一段，长一千九百二十三公尺；西坝河，长八华里；旱河，长二十六里。工程于上月十一日开始，二十五日先后完工；共组织三千一百余农民、小商贩等参加工作。农民深深认识到这是对自己有利的事。鱼地村的贫农王亮就说：我分的二亩地涝不着了，东湖渠村的刘德全说：只有共产党来了，才能挖河，国民党在时那能管这个。在分配任务时采取包工分段制，充分发挥了集体劳动的力量，这是挖河工程如期完成的一个重要因素。护城河一段修好后，可以加速水流速度，减少蚊虫，防止疾病。西坝河和旱河修好后，可使良田一万零九百七十八亩免于涝灾。

    【本报讯】泛滥六十年未经修整的凉水河，将被京郊十五区劳动人民所征服，而有利于农业生产。此河因年久失修，动辄决口；去夏更因阴雨连绵，河水外溢，沿岸万泉寺等十余村一百余顷土地，酿成水灾甚巨。群众迫切要求挖河。该区区政府接受群众意见，为实现增产一成计划，并照顾到当地人民的灾情，特拨发小米五万斤，以工代赈挖修河道，开宽加深。工程于三月二十九日正式开工，到达十六个村的有组织的民工一、一八二人，当天完成了全河工程的三分之一，共计一、六三九土方。每方八斤玉米，每人最高挣到十九斤玉米。群众热情甚高，万泉寺村自动献工者有八十余名。献柴煮绿豆汤者也不少。
