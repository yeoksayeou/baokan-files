　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania have launched a labor competition to welcome May Day.
    Polish workers and peasants have put forward production guarantees, and several state farms will complete their sowing plans before May 1st.
    Miners in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, have participated in the labor competition to celebrate May Day and the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia (May 9th). Shock worker teams in state-owned enterprises in Kralovy have proposed nineteen rationalization proposals in the past two months. After these proposals are implemented, 2,144,000 crowns (Czech currency) will be saved annually. More than 40 agricultural cooperatives in the Prague area have participated in the labor competition.
    The competition initiated by workers in the Ocniuri oilfield in Romania to welcome May Day has received widespread response. For example, workers and technicians at the Salat City Tobacco Factory have guaranteed that the April production plan will exceed March by 32 percent, and labor productivity will increase by 15 percent compared with the first quarter. Workers at the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" chemical plant have guaranteed that all departments will exceed the production plan by 5 to 30 percent and increase labor productivity by 5 to 30 percent.
