Strive to Finish Planting Cotton Before the Start of Summer
Hebei Shijiazhuang and Ding County Special Districts
Emergency Instructions to Rush-Plant Cotton
More Than a Thousand Cadres Dispatched to Cotton-Growing Areas
[Our Newspaper] Reporter Lu Sheng reports: The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the CPC Shijiazhuang District Committee of Hebei Province, in order to start sowing cotton before Grain Rain and finish before the Start of Summer, jointly issued emergency instructions on the 13th of this month, calling on all cadres and party members to intensify their leadership of the peasants and strive to complete the plan to plant two million mu of cotton. The instructions emphasized: Now that the cotton planting season has arrived, cadres at all levels in the entire special district must make every effort to rush-plant cotton. Leaders at all levels must also grasp three key links: (1) Mobilize the peasants to organize themselves to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power and ensure timely sowing. (2) At any time, dispel the masses' ideological concerns, solve specific difficulties in cotton planting, and strive to plant more cotton. (3) Strengthen the organization and leadership of cotton planting. Leading cadres at all levels must be clear: In these twenty days, cotton planting is the most central and critical task. All work must be subordinate to cotton planting. Each department in the Fourteen Special Districts has drawn 536 people to form cotton planting work assault teams, led by responsible comrades such as the commissioner, deputy commissioner, and deputy secretary of the district committee, to rush-plant cotton in cotton-producing counties such as Gaocheng, Shulu, Luancheng, Jin County, Zhengding, Huolu, Gaoyi, and Zhao County.
[Our Newspaper] After the Hebei Province Spring Ploughing Inspection Group inspected and gave instructions in the Ding County Special District, the Special Commissioner's Office and the CPC District Committee immediately discussed and studied the matter. The Special Commissioner's Office issued a mobilization order to urgently complete the cotton planting task; the District Committee made a "Decision to Thoroughly Eliminate the Mood of Failure and Resolutely Complete the Cotton Planting Plan." The decision pointed out: (1) Ideologically, leaders at all levels must resolutely eliminate the mood of failure, pay sufficient attention to the cotton planting task, oppose the tailism of losing confidence and coercive orders, and ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan. (2) Concentrate forces, focusing on counties, districts, and villages with high cotton planting rates, creating experiences to guide the general work. Make preparations before April 15th, and then comprehensively and deeply carry out the work. (3) All cadres should further mobilize the masses, conduct in-depth and careful calculations, and inspect cotton seeds and cotton fields from house to house, ensuring that cotton seeds are exchanged and loaned to farmers before Grain Rain, and prepare the cotton fields well to ensure early planting and expansion of cotton fields. (4) Carry out intensive farming and careful cultivation, apply more fertilizer, fully prepare insecticides, publicize pest control methods, and ensure a large cotton harvest. (5) Conduct extensive publicity based on the masses' ideological concerns. State-owned enterprises such as the Yarn and Cloth Company can adopt the method of signing contracts with the masses to reassure the masses and encourage them to plant cotton. (6) Party committees at all levels should become the organizers and commanders of the cotton planting movement, and branches should become the leading core of this movement. Every party member must be energized, leading the masses to ensure the completion of the cotton planting task. Currently, the commissioner of the special district and the members of the district committee are leading 569 cadres to assist in key cotton planting areas, and have decided to return only after the task is completed after Grain Full.
