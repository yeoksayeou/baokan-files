　　Milk Quality Inspection of All Dairy Farms
    Those Failing Three Times Will Be Punished
    To the Editor:
    Last year, the Health Bureau inspected the quality of milk from various dairy farms. The results showed that over 90% did not meet the standards, yet they were allowed to continue operating. It is said that the Health Bureau will soon test the milk quality of various dairy farms again. Why is this?
              Xue Yun

    Mr. Xue Yun:
    Regarding your inquiry, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau replies as follows:
    Milk is a major nutritional product. To safeguard public health, it is necessary for the Health Bureau to implement inspections of the environment and equipment of various dairy farms and to test milk quality. Last year, among the 98 dairy farms in Beijing, only 45 passed the inspection. Fifty-three had excessive coliform bacteria, excessively low fat content, and excessive total bacterial count. For those milk farms that did not meet the regulations, the Health Bureau ordered them to improve, and then took samples for re-inspection to confirm whether the improvements were effective. Those failing the test three times will be given appropriate punishment or a short-term suspension of business.

　　检验各奶场乳质
    三次不合格者即予处分编辑同志：
    去年卫生局曾检验各奶场牛乳质量，结果有百分之九十以上未合标准，但仍准继续营业。据说最近卫生局又要化验各奶场乳质了。这是为什么呢？
              雪云雪云君：
    所询问题，由北京市人民政府卫生局答复如下：
    牛奶是主要营养品之一，为维护大众健康，卫生局实施对各奶场的环境设备检查和乳质检验是必要的。去年北京九十八家奶场中，检验合格者仅四十五家，含有大肠菌，脂肪过低、杂菌过多者占五十三家。不合规定的牛奶场，卫生局令其改善后，再取样复检，以便证实是否收到实效。化验三次不合规定者，予以相当处罚或短期停业的处分。
