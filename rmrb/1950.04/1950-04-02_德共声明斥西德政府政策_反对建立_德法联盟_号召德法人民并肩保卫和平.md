Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th (TASS dispatch): The Central Secretariat of the German Communist Party has issued a statement regarding the policies of the Adenauer West German government.

The statement begins by stating that Adenauer intends to separate West Germany from the rest of Germany, thus making the reunification of Germany impossible. This fundamental spirit is expressed in his statements regarding the establishment of a "Franco-German Alliance" and the so-called "Franco-German economic unification."

Adenauer's recent statement was made immediately following McCloy's return from the United States. Adenauer's statement fully complies with the demands of the Wall Street bosses: to unite the Ruhr region and France's military potential through the establishment of a so-called "Franco-German Alliance" to realize the military plans of American imperialism against the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic.

At the behest of American imperialism and the warmongers Churchill and Adenauer, the remilitarization of West Germany must be realized to drive German youth to serve as cannon fodder for them in a new world war.

However, we are deeply convinced that our call for "friendship with the French people and their militant cooperation to defend peace and national independence" will be warmly received across the border, because our people themselves are also carrying out this struggle within the National Front of Democratic Germany.

　　德共声明斥西德政府政策
    反对建立“德法联盟”
    号召德法人民并肩保卫和平
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社柏林三月三十日讯：德国共产党中央书记处发表了关于阿登纳西德政府的政策的声明。
    声明首称，阿登纳打算把西德自德国的其他部分中分离出来，因而使德国统一的恢复成为不可能。在他的关于建立“德法联盟”和所谓“法德经济统一”的声明中，都表示了这种基本精神。
    阿登纳这次的声明：是紧接着麦克洛埃自美国回来之后发表的。阿登纳的声明完全符合华尔街老板的要求：一定要通过所谓“德法联盟”的建立，把鲁尔区和法国的军事潜力联合起来，以实现美帝国主义反对苏联、人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的军事计划。
    根据美帝国主义以及战争贩子邱吉尔和阿登纳的要求，西德的重行军事化必须实现，以驱使德国青年在新的世界战争中为他们充当炮灰。
    但是，我们深信，我们要求“与法国人民友好，并与他们进行战斗的合作，以保卫和平和民族独立”的号召，将在国境的彼方获得热烈的响应，因为我国人民本身亦正在民主德国全国阵线内进行着这个斗争。
