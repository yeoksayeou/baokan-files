Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 1st: Hu Zhen, commander of the remnant bandit Provisional 8th Division in Xiangxi, led more than 500 men, carrying one mortar, nine heavy machine guns, thirty-two light machine guns, and more than 600 rifles, and surrendered to us near Gao Village in Mayang County on March 9th. Since the middle of last month, our Xiangxi Military Region's bandit suppression troops have encircled Mayang, and after defeating the major bandit gangs within the territory, they have continued to pursue and suppress them separately. Hu's troops, intimidated by the might of our army, surrendered their weapons. At the same time, Zhang Zhiping, Deng Yuansheng, Fu Yushen, Wang Yuyun, and other regimental commanders under the division, as well as Deputy Brigade Commander Xing Nankai, Commander of the Fourth Detachment Zhang Yun, and many other officers surrendered.
