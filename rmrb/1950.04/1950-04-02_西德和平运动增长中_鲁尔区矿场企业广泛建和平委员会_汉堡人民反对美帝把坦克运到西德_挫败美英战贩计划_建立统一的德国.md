　　Xinhua News Agency, March 31st, from Berlin (TASS dispatch): The movement to strive for peace and oppose war preparations is growing daily in West Germany. Many peace committees are preparing to convene peace conferences in various states. The working people in the Ruhr area are the first to initiate this. Peace committees have been established in many mines and large enterprises. Workers at the "Dennebaum" mine in Bochum instructed their peace committee to immediately establish a joint committee with other peace committees in Bochum to actively lead the struggle for peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 31st, from Berlin (TASS dispatch): The chairman of the Hamburg Joint Peace Committee, Mr. Wacker, declared at a conference that the "Blom & Voss" factory in Hamburg, under British control, is producing tanks for the British. Recently, tank transport has been discovered many times at night in northern Hamburg. There is no doubt that these tanks were recently transported to Bremerhaven under the U.S. military aid program. Wacker declared: The residents of Hamburg and the entire German people need neither tanks nor occupying forces. What the German people need is the unification and revitalization of Germany, as well as a fair peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupying forces. They want to be the masters of their own country. Representatives of Hamburg women, dockworkers, and youth also emphasized that they are determined to work to maintain peace and thwart the plans of the U.S. and British war-mongers. They also announced that the people of Hamburg are determined to join the great peace front headed by the Soviet Union.

    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社柏林三月三十一日讯：争取和平、反对战争准备的运动，在西德日益增长中。许多和平委员会准备在各州召集和平大会。在这方面，首先发动的是鲁尔区域的劳动人民。和平委员会已在许多矿场与大企业公司内成立，巴察木的但奈巴姆矿的工人，指示他们的和平委员会立即与巴察木的其他和平委员会建立联合委员会，积极领导争取和平的斗争。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社柏林三月三十一日讯：汉堡联合和平委员会主席瓦克在大会上声称：在英国管制下的汉堡卜劳姆——沕斯工厂，正在生产着供给英国用的坦克。汉堡北部，最近在夜间曾多次发现运输坦克的情事。毫无疑问，这些坦克是在美国军援计划下于最近数周运到不来梅港的。瓦克宣称：汉堡居民以及全体德国人民，既不需要坦克，也不要占领军。德国人民需要的是德国的统一、复兴以及公正的缔结和约和撤退占领军。他们要作自己祖国的主人。汉堡妇女、港口工人及青年的代表们也都强调，他们决心为维护和平及挫败美英战争贩子的计划而努力。并宣布，汉堡人民已决心参加以苏联为首的伟大的和平阵线。
