Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The People's Governments at all levels in the Central South and Northwest Administrative Regions are vigorously leading farmers in preparing to plant economic crops such as cotton and hemp. In order to guarantee the completion of the region's target of 2.46 million dan of cotton, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee established four cotton planting guidance work teams at the beginning of last month. Each team is equipped with agricultural technology, fertilizer, pest control and other technical cadres, and is dispatched to the cotton producing areas of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces to guide cotton planting work. The Agriculture Department of the Hubei Provincial People's Government has also established a Cotton Industry Improvement Office, planning to restore 5.79 million mu of cotton fields in more than 50 cotton-producing counties along the Yangtze and Han rivers. It also plans to purchase 25,000 dan of high-quality cotton seeds from Shanghai and other places, and plant 210,000 mu of high-quality cotton fields in the cotton-producing areas of Jingzhou, Xiangyang, Mianyang, and Xiaogan. The Agriculture Department of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has purchased more than 2,000 dan of Dai character cotton seeds for promotion in Pengze, Jiujiang, and other places. The Agriculture Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government has loaned 600,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds in Shanzhou, Luoyang, Nanyang, Shangqiu and other places. Including the high-quality cotton seeds prepared by the cotton farmers themselves, it is estimated that 180,000 mu of high-quality cotton fields can be sown in the province. In order to restore and develop hemp production in Jiangxi Province, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government plans to expand hemp planting by 50,000 mu in the famous Xia cloth producing areas of Wanzai and Yichun. The province has also purchased 30,000 jin of high-quality yellow jute seeds from Zhejiang Province for distribution to various hemp-producing areas.

The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee has now completed several preparations for cotton planting. On March 20, the department transported 26,400 dan of S-character cotton, No. 517 and other pure cotton seeds and 2,000 tons of ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizer to the areas where they were to be loaned. Before the start of cotton planting, the department will also transport 1,000 tons of ammonium sulfide chemical fertilizer purchased with funds allocated by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to the cotton-producing areas in the Northwest. In order to ensure that various pure cotton seeds and chemical fertilizers are loaned to cotton farmers in a timely manner, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the region, the Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China, and the Agriculture Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government have selected a large number of cadres to form six work groups, which were dispatched to various sub-districts in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, on the 23rd of last month to assist agricultural extension stations in their work.

    【新华社六日讯】中南、西北两大行政区各级人民政府正大力领导农民进行种植棉、麻等经济作物的准备工作。中南军政委员会农林部为保证完成全区产棉二百四十六万担的任务，特于上月初成立四个植棉指导工作队，每队配有农艺、肥料、防除虫害等技术干部，分赴河南、湖北、江西、湖南四省产棉区，指导植棉工作。湖北省人民政府农业厅也成立了棉业改进处，计划在长江、汉水沿岸五十余产棉县份，恢复棉田五百七十九万亩。并准备于上海等地收购优良棉种二万五千担，在荆州、襄阳、沔阳、孝感等产棉区种植优良品种棉田二十一万亩。江西省人民政府农业厅已收购岱字棉种二千余担，在彭泽、九江等地推广。河南省人民政府农业厅在陕州、洛阳、南阳、商邱等地贷放优良棉种六十万斤，加上棉农自备的优良棉种，估计全省可播种良种棉田十八万亩。江西省人民政府为恢复和发展该省麻产，拟于著名的夏布产地万载、宜春一带扩大麻五万亩。该省并已向浙江省采购优良黄麻种三万斤，贷发给各产麻区。
    西北军政委员会农林部现已完成植棉的若干准备工作。该部于三月二十日将收购的二万六千四百担斯字棉、五一七号等纯棉种及二千吨硫酸铔化学肥料分别运至贷放地区。该部并将于植棉开始前将中央人民政府农业部拨款订购之硫化铔化学肥料一千吨运至西北各产棉区。为了使各种纯棉种及化学肥料及时贷给棉农，该区农林部、人民银行西北区行及陕西省人民政府农业厅已抽调大批干部，组成六个工作组，于上月二十三日分赴陕西关中各分区协助农业推广站进行工作。
