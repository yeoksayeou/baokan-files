[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The spring dredging and flood prevention project in the suburbs of Beijing has been largely completed, and 120,000 mu of farmland along the river can now be protected from flooding. Currently, with the exception of the main stream of the Feng River, the main and tributary streams of the Ba River, the tributary streams of the Feng River, the upper reaches of the Liangshui River, the Beiqiao River, the upper reaches of the Qing River, the Longxugou, and the lower reaches of the Nanhan River have all been dredged. The total length is 74,058 meters, and 332,584 cubic meters of mud have been excavated. The entire project was carried out using a work-for-relief method, combining disaster relief and ensuring that it did not interfere with agricultural production. The project began on the 8th of last month. The Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government had made many preparations. In January, the committee invited the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Municipal Bureau of Public Health Engineering, and water conservancy experts to repeatedly study the water conservancy situation in the suburbs and the project plan; in February, it invited assistant teachers and students from the Engineering Colleges of Peking University and Tsinghua University to meticulously survey and map the Feng River and other major rivers. The few rivers that had not been surveyed were also evaluated by district and village cadres in conjunction with farmers experienced in flood prevention and river dredging, who estimated the undulations of the landforms in the project area and roughly determined the cross-sectional conditions of the rivers. Before the start of construction, each district held meetings of cadres in villages along the river to determine the steps of the work. Generally, villages were used as units, and on the principle of voluntary association, dredging teams, squads, and groups were systematically formed, and the work was carried out using a contract-based section system. Because the farmers along the river deeply realized that the government's leadership in dredging the river was to assist the liberated farmers in protecting the fruits of their labor, their work enthusiasm was very high, and some women, teenagers, and the elderly were not afraid of the cold wind and water, and actively participated in the work. Wang Liang, a poor peasant in Yudi Village, said: "My two mu of land will not be flooded." Liu Dequan of Donghuqu Village said: "Only the Communist Party can dredge the river; the Kuomintang could not care about this." Through this river dredging project, 120,000 mu of frequently flooded farmland in the suburbs of Beijing can be protected from flooding, ensuring agricultural production for more than 40,000 farmers along the river; more than 12,000 disaster-stricken farmers who participated in the river dredging received more than 500,000 jin of millet as work relief, and they safely passed through the spring famine.

　　京郊挖河工程大部完成
    沿河十二万亩良田可免涝灾
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊春季挖河防涝工程，现已大部完成，沿河十二万亩良田，因而可以免于涝灾。现在除凤河主流外，坝河主流与支流、凤河支流、凉水河上流、北桥河、清河上流龙须沟及南旱河下流均已疏浚完毕。总计全长七万四千零五十八公尺，挖泥三十三万二千五百八十四立方公尺。全部工程是在结合救灾、不误农时的原则下用以工代赈的方式进行的。工程自上月八日开始，市府郊区工作委员会曾作了许多准备工作。在一月间该会曾邀请农林部、水利部、市卫生工程局等单位及水利专家反复研究了郊区水利情况和此次工程计划；二月间又邀请北京大学和清华大学工学院的部分助教与同学详细测绘了凤河等主要河流。少数未经测绘的河流也由区村干部协同富有防涝挖河经验的农民估量了工程地区地貌的起伏状态，略定了河流的断面情况。各区在动工前都分别在沿河村庄召开了干部会议，确定工作的步骤。一般都以村为单位，本自愿结合的原则有系统的组成挖河大队、分队和小组，采用包工分段制进行挖河工作。由于沿河农民深深认识到政府领导挖河是为了协助翻身农民保护自己的劳动果实，所以工作情绪都很高，有些妇女、少年和老年也都不怕风寒、水冷，纷纷参加工作。鱼地村贫农王亮说：我分的二亩地涝不着了。东湖渠村的刘德全说：“只有共产党来了才能挖河，国民党在时那能管这个”。经过此次挖河工程，京郊以往经常被涝的十二万亩良田可以免于涝灾，使沿河一带四万余农民的农业生产获得保障；参加挖河的一万二千余灾区农民共获工赈小米五十万余斤，亦安然渡过了春荒。
