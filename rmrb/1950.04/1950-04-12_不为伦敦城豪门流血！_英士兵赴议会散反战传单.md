    British Soldiers Go to Parliament to Distribute Anti-War Leaflets
    Xinhua News Agency, London, April 11th: According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency in London: When the British House of Commons was discussing the "lack of progress" in Britain's colonial war against the people of Malaya on the 6th, a delegation of soldiers who had participated in the Malayan war entered Parliament and distributed anti-war leaflets. The leaflets stated that the soldiers were unwilling to support the war against the Malayan people, their former allies. "This is a war of aggression, and not a drop of blood should be shed for the benefit of the tycoons of the City of London." The leaflets demanded: "Withdraw our troops! Stop the Malayan war!"

    不为伦敦城豪门流血！
    英士兵赴议会散反战传单
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社伦敦消息：当英国下院于六日正在讨论英国反马来亚人民的殖民战争“没有进展”时，有一个曾经参加过马来亚战争的士兵代表团走进议会，并散发了反战传单。传单内称，士兵们不愿支持对他们的昔日盟友马来亚人民的战争。“这是一个侵略战争，决不能为伦敦城豪门的利益流一滴血。”传单要求：“撤回我们的军队！停止马来亚战争！”
