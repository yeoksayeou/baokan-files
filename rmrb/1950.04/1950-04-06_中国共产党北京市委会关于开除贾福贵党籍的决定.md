　　The Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Jia Fugui from the Party
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on expelling Jia Fugui from the Party. The full text is as follows:
    Jia Fugui was a cadre of the Private Industry Trade Union of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. He joined the Party in 1946. Although he had done some work to serve the people in the past, he consistently refused to study and seek progress. In 1948, he received a warning from the Party for embezzlement. After being transferred to work in Beijing, he still did not repent. Finally, he degenerated to the point of colluding with Xu Fusheng, who had worked as a special agent for the Japanese, and Chen Yuncheng, a Kuomintang stray soldier, using his cadre status to cover up Chen Yuncheng's transfer of shares related to enemy and puppet industries, and accepting bribes of 2.25 million yuan, cigarettes, and clothing. This kind of degenerate, corrupt, and lawless behavior is not only unacceptable by Party discipline but also intolerable by national law. In order to ensure the purity of the Party and strictly enforce Party discipline, it is decided to expel him from the Party.
                            The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, April 4th

　　中国共产党北京市委会关于开除贾福贵党籍的决定
    【本报讯】中共北京市委会发表关于开除贾福贵党籍的决定，全文如下：
    贾福贵是本市总工会私营产业工会干事，一九四六年入党，过去虽曾作过一些为人民服务的工作，但一贯不肯学习，不求进步，曾于一九四八年因贪污受到党的警告处分，调来北京工作后仍不知悔改，最后竟堕落到与曾为日本作特务工作的许福盛及国民党流散军人陈云程相勾结，以干部身份掩护陈云程转移与敌伪产业有关之股金，并接受贿赂二百二十五万元及香烟衣料等，这种堕落腐化，贪赃枉法的行为，不仅为党纪所不许，并为国家法律所不容，兹为保证党的纯洁，严肃党的纪律，决定开除其党籍。
                            中国共产党北京市委员会  四月四日
