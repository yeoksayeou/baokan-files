Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Due to price stability, the general public's psychology of "valuing goods over currency" that has existed for many years has begun to undergo a significant change. As a result, the deposit figures of People's Banks in various regions have greatly increased in the past month or so. According to statistics from the Head Office of the People's Bank, as of April 21, the total deposit amount increased by 82.8% compared to the end of March, and by 127.5% compared to the end of February.

The deposit figures of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank as of April 20 increased by 95% compared to March 20, and by 193% compared to the end of February. The principal-protected, value-guaranteed fixed-term savings deposits launched by the branch on April 15 are extremely popular among citizens. As of April 24, there were 3,349 depositors with a total deposit amount of over 545,000 units.

The demand deposit of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank on April 14 increased by 8.8 times compared to April 1; deposits from private banks and firms also increased from 120.8 billion yuan at the beginning of the month to 128.2 billion yuan on the 14th. Conversely, the real value savings deposits, which could maintain purchasing power during price increases, decreased from 3.3 million units at the beginning of April to 800,000 units on the 14th, a decrease of more than three-quarters.

The Shanghai Branch, affiliated with the East China Regional Branch of the People's Bank, saw its deposit figures in March increase by 37% compared to the average balance in February. Among them, real value savings deposits decreased by 46% compared to February, while currency deposits increased by 280% compared to February. In the latter half of March to April 12, the number of depositors in the Southern Anhui Branch of the People's Bank increased by more than 91%, with private depositors increasing more than fourfold. The situation in Qingdao City is similar. The currency deposit figures of the Qingdao Branch of the People's Bank in March increased by 1.5 times compared to February, with private depositors increasing by more than twofold. The demand deposit launched by the branch on April 13 received deposits of over 5.2 billion yuan on the same day. On April 21, principal-protected, value-guaranteed fixed-term savings deposits were added, and deposits of over 19,000 units were also absorbed on the same day.

During the price fluctuations in Wuhan City in late February, the real value savings deposits absorbed by banks reached a maximum of 300,000 units per day. Now, most of it has been converted into currency deposits. According to statistics from the Hankou Branch of the People's Bank, the balance of real value savings deposits on April 11 decreased by 37.68% compared to March 6, while private currency deposits increased by 30.71%.

The average deposit balance of the Xi'an Branch of the People's Bank from April 1 to 20 increased by 81.8% compared to January, completing and exceeding the deposit absorption task assigned to the branch by the Northwest Regional Branch by more than 1.5 times.
