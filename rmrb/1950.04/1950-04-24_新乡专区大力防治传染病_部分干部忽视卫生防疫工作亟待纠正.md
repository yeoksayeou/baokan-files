Xinxiang Prefecture Vigorously Prevents and Controls Infectious Diseases
Some Cadres Neglect Sanitary and Epidemic Prevention Work, Which Urgently Needs Correction
[Our Newspaper] From December of last year to January of this year, Jiyuan, Qinyang, Wuzhi and other counties in Xinxiang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, experienced outbreaks of infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, and scarlet fever. In March, measles outbreaks were again discovered in Wuzhi, Xiuwu, Jiaozuo and other counties. The Commissioner's Office dispatched epidemic prevention teams to the affected areas to cooperate with local medical personnel in vaccinating against smallpox and vigorously eradicating the epidemic. In the process of preventing and controlling epidemics in the prefecture, the following problems were discovered:

(1) Local cadres' emphasis on epidemic prevention work, the establishment of health organizations, the prompt reporting of epidemic situations, and the organization of forces for timely prevention and control are important keys to preventing the spread of infectious diseases. In Jiyuan, Qinyang, Xiuwu, and other counties and regions within the prefecture that already had health organizations, infectious diseases were quickly discovered during the winter outbreaks, and doctors were promptly organized to carry out prevention and control, thereby preventing the widespread epidemic of infectious diseases. However, Yuanyang County previously lacked health organizations, and cadres had a paralyzing mindset regarding epidemics. Smallpox broke out as early as September of last year, but it was not discovered until the epidemic prevention team went to the countryside in February of this year, giving infectious diseases the opportunity to expand and spread. The Xinxiang Prefectural Health Section specifically pointed this out in its winter health work summary report, but some local cadres still exhibit serious bureaucracy and neglect health work. For example, measles broke out in Xiaogao District of Wuzhi County this spring, but the leading organs did not understand the situation for a long time and did not organize timely prevention and control. In particular, the town chief of Xiaogao Town even falsely reported the epidemic situation. The village chief of Ningguo Village concealed the disease situation in the village and did not allow the epidemic prevention team to know. When the epidemic prevention team arrived in the village, he was afraid of trouble and said, "There are not many measles cases in our village," which almost caused measles to spread throughout the county. In the second and third districts alone, there were 2,006 patients in early April, and 163 people had already died. (2) Farmers lack health knowledge. After an epidemic occurs, they do not know how to prevent it and are often at a loss, allowing the epidemic to spread. For example, when smallpox broke out in Huangzhuang Village, Third District of Yanjin, some people took their illnesses and ran to Hu'an Village to "hide from the disease," which resulted in smallpox also breaking out in Hu'an Village. Many sick families do not know how to blockade and isolate, often causing the disease to spread to the entire family and the entire village. Some even brought infectious diseases to other places due to going to school, visiting relatives, etc. (3) Some old doctors in rural areas prescribe medicines randomly. For example, when scarlet fever broke out in Yuanyang, some doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine initially used superficial medicines, sweating medicines, or laxatives to treat it, which resulted in the patient's heart weakening and increasing the mortality rate. Some doctors in Jining County used "Zhegu vegetable" and "Wawa Ning" to treat smallpox, wasting resources and failing to cure the disease.

In response to the above situations, the Xinxiang Commissioner's Office has notified various localities, requesting that the leading organs of counties and districts pay attention to epidemic prevention and health work, keep abreast of the disease situation, actively organize doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to study prevention and treatment methods, improve medical technology, and launch a spring epidemic prevention campaign to oppose the paralyzing, waiting for superiors, and pessimistic and disappointed sentiments among cadres. It also uses various methods to carry out extensive epidemic prevention publicity, using concrete accounting methods (such as pointing out the numbers of human and material losses caused by illness, etc.) and actual examples to educate cadres and the masses, and overcome the idea of ​​underestimating health and epidemic prevention work. In addition, it conducts in-depth inspections to correct deviations and promote good prevention and treatment experiences. (According to the "Work Report" and "Winter Health Work Summary" materials of the Xinxiang Commissioner's Office on April 8)

### 新乡专区大力防治传染病  部分干部忽视卫生防疫工作亟待纠正

　　新乡专区大力防治传染病
    部分干部忽视卫生防疫工作亟待纠正
    【本报讯】平原省新乡专区的济源、沁阳、武陟等县，去年十二月至今年一月，曾发生天花、麻疹、猩红热等传染病；三月份，武陟、修武、焦作等县又发现麻疹流行。专署为此曾派遣防疫队到发病区域配合当地医务工作人员施种牛痘，大力扑灭疫病。在该专区防治疫病工作中，发现了下列几个问题：
    （一）地方干部重视防疫工作，建立卫生组织，迅速报告疫情并组织力量及时防治，是阻止传染病流行的重要关键。该专区的济源、沁阳、修武等县及其他已有卫生组织的地区，在冬季发生传染病时，均能很快发现疫病，及早组织了医生进行防治，因而阻止了传染病的扩大流行。但原阳县以前缺乏卫生组织，干部对疫病存有麻痹思想，去年九月就发生了天花，直至今年二月防疫队下乡时才被发现，因而给予传染病以扩大蔓延的机会。新乡专署卫生科在冬季卫生工作总结报告中，曾特别指出此点，但部分地方干部存在着严重的官僚主义，仍忽视卫生工作，如武陟县小高区今春发生麻疹，领导机关长期不了解情况，没有及时组织防治；特别是该区小高镇镇长竟至假报病情；宁郭村村长掩饰该村病况，不让防疫队知道。防疫队抵该村时，他怕麻烦，即说：“我村没几个麻疹病”，以致麻疹几乎蔓延全县，仅二、三两区，四月初就有患者二千零六人，并已死亡一百六十三人。（二）农民缺乏卫生知识，发生疫病后不知预防办法，往往手足无措，使疫病传播开来。如延津三区黄庄村发生天花时，有人带着病跑到胡岸村去“躲病”，结果使胡岸村也发生天花。许多病家不知封锁隔离，每每使病疫波及全家，扩及全村。有的还因上学、串门等，把传染病带至别处。（三）农村旧有医生，有的乱投药饵。如原阳发生猩红热时，最初曾有中西医用表药、发汗药或泻药去治，结果使病人心脏衰弱，增大了死亡率。济宁县有的医生以“鹧鸪菜”、“娃娃宁”等去治天花，浪费资财，未能治病。
    新乡专署针对上述情况，曾通报各地，要求县区领导机关重视防疫卫生工作，经常了解病情，积极组织中西医研究预防与治疗办法，提高医疗技术，并发动群众开展春季防疫运动，反对干部中的麻痹、等待上级思想与悲观失望的情绪。并利用各种方式大量进行防疫宣传，用具体算账办法（如指出患病对人力、物力损失的数字等）及实际事例来教育干部与群众，克服轻视卫生防疫工作的思想。并深入检查，纠正偏向，推广好的防治经验。（根据新乡专署四月八日《工作报告》及《冬季卫生工作总结》材料）
