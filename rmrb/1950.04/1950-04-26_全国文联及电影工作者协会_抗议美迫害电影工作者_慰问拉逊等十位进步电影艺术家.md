　　Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to recent news, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the cases of film artists Lawson and Trumbo on April 10th, meaning that Lawson, Trumbo, and their eight colleagues will be forced to go to jail. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the All-China Film Workers Association were extremely indignant upon hearing this news and issued a protest statement today stating:
　　In October 1947, the U.S. "House Un-American Activities Committee," under the pretext of investigating "the extent of communist infiltration into the Hollywood film industry," summoned progressive film artists. Lawson and ten other well-known film screenwriters and directors, in order to protect the democratic rights of the American people, resolutely refused to answer the unreasonable inquiries of the "Un-American Activities Committee," and refused to explain their relationship with trade unions and politics, and were therefore accused of committing the so-called crime of insulting Congress. In April 1948, the Washington Federal Court, following the will of the American reactionary ruling class, sentenced these ten progressive film artists to at least one year in prison and a fine of one thousand dollars. Lawson and others refused to yield and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. At that time, progressive people all over the United States and the world rose up to support these ten film artists. The case was delayed for a year, and now the U.S. Supreme Court has blatantly disregarded public opinion and refused to accept Lawson and others' appeals.
　　The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the All-China Film Workers Association express infinite anger at the U.S. Supreme Court's trampling on the basic human rights of the American people, express infinite admiration for the spirit of Lawson and other ten progressive film artists in adhering to the truth and vowing not to yield, and extend sincere condolences for their persecution.
　　We firmly believe that the violent actions of the U.S. "House Un-American Activities Committee," the Washington Federal Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court will never be able to undermine the determination and increasingly vigorous struggle of the broad masses of the American people to protect their rights! We, representing the literary and artistic circles of the People's Republic of China, solemnly declare: We fully support the just stand of Lawson and ten other progressive film artists, and oppose the increasingly blatant anti-democratic and fascist crimes of the American reactionary ruling class.
　　We will continue to struggle together with the broad masses of peace-loving and democracy-supporting people around the world and in the United States until this unjust case is redressed.

    抗议美迫害电影工作者
    慰问拉逊等十位进步电影艺术家
    【新华社二十五日讯】据最近消息：美国最高法院于四月十日拒绝复审电影艺术家拉逊及杜伦波案，因而拉逊、杜伦波及其八位同事将被迫入狱。中华全国文学艺术界联合会及中华全国电影工作者协会闻讯之下，不胜愤慨，特于今日发表抗议声明称：
    一九四七年十月，美国“众议院取缔反美活动委员会”，借口调查“共产主义渗入好莱坞电影事业的程度”，传讯进步的电影艺术家。拉逊等十位著名的电影编剧者和导演为了保护美国人民的民主权利，曾坚决地拒绝答复“取缔反美活动委员会”的无理询问，拒绝说明他们与职工会和政治的关系，因此被指为犯了所谓侮辱国会的罪名。一九四八年四月，华盛顿联邦法院遵从美国反动统治阶级的意旨，对于这十位进步的电影艺术家宣判至少监禁一年并罚金一千元的判决。拉逊等不肯屈服，乃向美国最高法院上诉。当时全美以及世界的进步人士都为这十位电影艺术家奋起声援。案件拖延一年，现在美国最高法院竟悍然不顾舆论，对于拉逊等的上诉，又复拒不受理。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会及中华全国电影工作者协会对于美国最高法院此种蹂躏美国人民的基本人权的行为，表示无限的愤怒，对于拉逊等十位进步电影艺术家的坚持真理、誓不屈服的精神，表示无限的钦佩，对于他们的横遭迫害敬致诚恳的慰问。
    我们深信：美国“众议院取缔反美活动委员会”，华盛顿联邦法院以及美国最高法院此种暴戾的行为，绝不能打击美国广大人民的保护美国人民权利的决心与愈益奋发的斗争！我们代表中华人民共和国的文学艺术界人士，郑重声言：我们全力支持拉逊等十位进步的电影艺术家的正义的立场，反对美国反动统治阶级的愈来愈露骨的反民主的法西斯的罪行。
    我们将和全世界的以及美国的爱好和平与拥护民主的广大人民一起继续抗争，直到这一个冤狱平反为正。
