　　World Peace Movement in March
　　March 1st to April 8th, 1950
　　World Peace Congress Standing Committee
　　From March 15th to 19th, the Standing Committee of the World Congress for the Defence of Peace held its third meeting in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and adopted a solemn declaration. It demanded the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the declaration of the first government to use atomic weapons as a war criminal; it called on the people of all countries to appoint representatives to participate in the Second World Congress for the Defence of Peace to be held in Italy at the end of this year. Based on the resolutions of the plenary session, the Standing Committee of the World Congress issued a call at the end of March demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, calling on people all over the world to sign this call.
　　Since February, the Standing Committee of the Peace Congress has sent delegations to various countries to submit proposals for the defence of peace; and requested parliaments of various countries to discuss and accept them. On March 8th, the delegation of the World Congress that visited the Soviet Union was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was the first to support the proposals of the World Congress for the defence of peace. This proposal was also unanimously supported by the parliaments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, North Korea, and the German Democratic Republic, as well as the people of all countries in the world.
　　However, the decisions of the Peace Committee caused great panic among the warmongering groups. The US State Department even refused to issue entry visas to the delegation of the World Congress. The British government also refused to issue entry visas to Soviet and Hungarian representatives. The Dutch authorities, obeying their American masters, even expelled the delegation from the country. This caused serious protests from the people of the Netherlands and other countries. The ruling groups of France and Italy, intimidated by the激憤 of the masses, dared not refuse to receive the delegation, and had to promise to discuss this document in parliament.

　　The Peace Movement Continues to Develop in Various Countries
　　China
　　The China Committee for the Defence of World Peace held a meeting on March 8th to bid farewell to delegate Xiao San, who was attending the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress. It also adopted resolutions on the organization and establishment of various working committees.
　　The working committee held its first meeting on March 19th, deciding on two major tasks for the year: strengthening domestic publicity and promoting international liaison. The working committee also held its second meeting on April 2nd, unanimously endorsing the resolutions of the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress, and issued a declaration calling on the people of the whole country to respond. The meeting decided to publish a special issue of "Defence of World Peace" every month, and decided to quickly establish branches of the China Committee for the Defence of World Peace in eleven major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou.

　　Other People's Democratic Countries
　　Workers, peasants, students, cultural workers, staff, merchants, and manufacturers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Germany, Mongolia, and North Korea have widely gathered to discuss the tasks of the struggle to defend peace. Local peace movement organizations have also been widely established in cities, towns, villages, and enterprises.

　　United States
　　The All-American Trade Union Congress for Peace is currently launching a petition movement with 100,000 signatures. People in New York and Maryland have held mass rallies in support of peace. Eleven national organizations have successively proposed demands for peace to the government and Congress. In early April, 250 American celebrities issued a declaration calling for the "Mid-Century Peace Congress" to be held in Chicago on May 29th.

　　Britain
　　The British Peace Committee responded to the resolutions of the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress and decided to launch a national peace petition movement.

　　France
　　The French Communist Party held its twelfth national congress near Paris from the 2nd to the 6th, discussing the strengthening of leadership in the struggle for national independence and the defence of peace. The congress also issued a letter to the French people, calling on them to unite in action to eliminate the terrible disaster of atomic war, save France, and defend peace. Prior to this, workers in various ports of France, under the call of the French General Confederation of Labour on March 6th, held a 24-hour experimental general strike to oppose the soon-to-arrive US "military aid" materials. The first batch of US "military aid" materials therefore dared not be directly transported to French ports, but detoured to French North Africa. However, dockworkers in North Africa also decided to refuse to unload them. The movement to refuse to unload "military aid" materials is unfolding throughout France.

　　Netherlands
　　The Dutch working people resolutely protested the series of military meetings held by the "North Atlantic Treaty" group in The Hague. "Peace travel teams" from various places also arrived in The Hague on April 1st to participate in the demonstration.

　　Italy
　　The ports of Genoa and Taranto in Italy held protest rallies on April 2nd against the transportation of American munitions to Italy. The secretariat of the Italian Peace Committee held a special meeting on the 1st, resolving to instruct local peace branches to take various forms to oppose the transportation of American "military aid" materials to Italy. Local organizations of the Italian Socialist Party generally held special meetings before April 6th to organize the people to protest the movement of American "military aid" materials to Italy.

　　Austria
　　One hundred and twenty local peace movement organizations have been established in various parts of Austria, and a national Austrian Congress for the Defence of Peace will be held in Vienna from June 10th to 11th.

　　West Germany
　　Organizations for the peace movement have been established in Hesse, Munich, Hamburg, Bamberg, the Ruhr, and 巴察木 and other places in West Germany.

　　Nordic Countries
　　Democratic youths from Sweden, Finland, and Norway held a peace relay race to celebrate the opening of the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress. The Norwegian Peace Committee held a meeting in Oslo on March 24th and resolved to reorganize into the "Norwegian Association of Peace Advocates." After the end of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress, the first meeting of "和协" was held immediately.

　　Japan
　　Democratic groups such as the Japan Association for the Defence of Peace and the League for the Defence of Democracy have launched a three-month campaign throughout Japan starting from April 1st to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. The week from April 21st to 28th has been designated as Anti-War Week. Japanese war widows also held a congress, guaranteeing to use all their strength to fight for peace. Associations of scientific and cultural workers and poets have successively issued statements calling on the Japanese people to oppose new wars.

　　Israel
　　Democratic youth and students in Israel held a national congress for the defence of peace in the capital on March 10th and 11th.

　　世界和运一月
    一九五○年三月一日至四月八日
    世界和大常委会
    三月十五日至十九日，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行第三次会议，通过了庄严的宣言。要求无条件禁止原子武器和宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯；号召各国人民，指派代表参加将于本年底在意大利举行的第二次世界拥护和平大会。和大常委会根据全会决议，于三月底发出了要求禁止原子武器的呼吁书，号召全世界人民在这个呼吁书上签名。
    和平大会常委会自二月开始派遣了代表团分访各国，提送保卫和平的建议文告；并要求各国议会加以讨论和接受。三月八日访问苏联的和大代表团，受到了苏联人民的热烈欢迎。苏联最高苏维埃首先支持和大保卫和平的建议。这项建议并得到波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜以及德意志民主共和国等国议会和世界各国人民的一致支持。
    但是和委会的决定，引起了战争贩子集团极大的恐慌。美国国务院竟拒发和大代表团的入境证。英政府亦拒发给苏、匈籍代表的入境证。荷兰当局则听命于美国主子，竟将代表团驱逐出境。这曾引起了荷兰与各国人民的严重抗议。法、意的统治集团慑于群众的激愤，不敢拒绝接待代表团，并不得不允诺在议会中讨论这项文告。
