　　Assistance Problems in Workers' Creation
　　Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles Answers Wang Hequn and Others
Editor:
　　Several of us workers have written a script for a Henan Opera performance, and we would like to perform it. We have the following questions, please answer them:
　　1. Which agency should this script be submitted to for review?
　　2. If there are any inappropriate parts in it, will the reviewing agency modify it? Will we be penalized?
　　3. After the script is reviewed and approved, is the performance location decided by ourselves? Or is it designated by the reviewing agency?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xingtai Railway Station Workers, Wang Hequn, et al.
Comrades Wang Hequn, et al.:
　　Your letter has been forwarded to the Guidance and Liaison Department of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles for reply (and has been reviewed by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles) as follows:
　　In your busy work, you have squeezed out time and utilized collective strength to create new dramas, which is very meaningful work. We hope that you can continue to promote this spirit in the future and further develop worker’s literary and art movement based on your new life experiences, such as the intense and enthusiastic production of workers in building the new people's railway.
　　Regarding the questions you raised, our opinions are as follows:
　　(1) You can ask the cultural and educational departments of the railway trade union, or the Propaganda Department of the County or Town Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Education Section of the People's Government to help revise your scripts and other works.
　　(2) If there are any inappropriate parts in the work, they will help the author to modify them; if they really cannot be modified, they should also point out the shortcomings in the work to the author and put forward suggestions for improvement. Of course, there will be no penalties.
　　(3) There are no restrictions on the performance location, which can be decided by trade unions at all levels in consultation with the local government or agencies.

　　工人创作的帮助问题
    河北省文联答王合群等问编辑同志：
    我们几个工友编写了一个以河南梆子演唱的剧本，想将它演出，现有以下几个问题，请你们解答：
    一、这剧本应送什么机关审核？
    二、其中如有不妥当的地方，审查机关是否会予以修改？我们是否要受到处分？
    三、剧本经审查批准后，其演出地点是由自己决定呢？或是由审查机关指定？
              邢台车站工人王合群等王合群等同志：
    来信经我们转请河北省文联指导联络部答复（并经全国文联审阅）如下：
    你们在忙碌的工作中，挤出时间，发挥了集体力量，创作新剧，这正是很有意义的工作。希望你们今后能继续发扬这种精神，进一步地根据自己新的生活体验——如在建设人民新铁路中，工人们紧张热烈的生产情况等，作为创作题材，开展工人文艺运动。
    关于你们所提的问题，我们的意见如下：
    （一）你们所创作的剧本和其他作品，可请铁路工会文教部门，或交县、镇中共党委会宣传部及人民政府教育科帮助修改。
    （二）作品中如有不妥当的地方，他们当会帮助作者加以修改；如实在不能修改者，他们亦应当给作者指出作品中的缺点，以及提出改进意见，当然不会有任何处分。
    （三）演出地点没有什么限制，可由各级工会与当地政府或机关部门洽商决定。
          编者
