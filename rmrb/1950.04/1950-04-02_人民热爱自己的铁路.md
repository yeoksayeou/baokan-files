　　The People Love Their Railways
    Editor:
    Today, the railways belong to the people, and the people love their railways. Let me tell you a few moving stories.
    I. Li Qingxiu Raises the Alarm
    On the morning of September 9th last year, locomotive number 694 on the Beijing-Hankou Railway was pulling passenger-freight train number 345 from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou. When the train reached the area between Xinxiang and Xiaoji, the driver saw a farmer ahead waving a red cloth as a signal to warn them, and the train stopped. The farmer's name was Li Qingxiu. That morning, he was holding his child and went to the field to check on the crops when he saw a 360mm fracture on the surface of a railway track, knowing that the train would inevitably be in danger. Therefore, he didn't even bother to check the crops and took off his child's red bib as a signal to wait for the train to come and stop it. Thus, this train was saved from danger, passengers were saved from death, and the people's railway was saved from damage.
    II. Residents of Zhoujiahe Village Rescue the Roadbed
    There is Bridge No. 179 between Guoleizhuang and Chaigoubao, west of Zhangjiakou on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. The area is remote, and many villagers nearby are opium smokers. Before liberation, robberies and thefts often occurred. Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries often relied on armed suppression, extortion, and all kinds of evil deeds. After liberation, the People's Railway Police Xiao Fengshan's squad was sent to guard Bridge No. 179, helping the farmers to pull wheat, carry water, repair houses, and pick soybeans, which made the farmers very grateful. They automatically helped protect the railway, patrolling the sides of the railway in shifts at night. Since then, no one has damaged or stolen anything. On August 15th, in the middle of the night, it was raining heavily. Liu Runlan from Zhoujiahe Village went to the field to see if the crops had been damaged by the water. Approaching Bridge No. 179, he found that the embankment protecting the roadbed had been washed away by the water. He immediately returned to the village to report. The village chief, Huo Chunting, immediately gathered one hundred and forty-four villagers, armed with tools for emergency repairs, and blocked the damaged embankment. Then, they dug open a culvert that had not been opened for more than three years and released the water, and the roadbed was saved from danger. The village chief and two others were still worried and waited for the train to come, turning on the lights to tell the driver to slow down, and the train safely passed. The next day, they called over seventy more people and worked continuously for two days, digging a ditch six feet wide and more than a mile long to let the water flow into the river, and the roadbed was no longer damaged by the water.
    III. Hu Lanying and the Demonstration Team
    Hu Lanying, the wife of Zhang Dacheng, a member of the Xinyang Engineering Area Demonstration Team, was returning home from buying groceries in the street. Passing the No. 995 signboard, she saw that the first nine-meter steel rail to the north had been broken off by a train going north. She quickly dropped her grocery basket and, hobbling on her small feet, went to the place where the demonstration team was working to report, running two kilometers in one breath. Everyone who heard the report rushed to the No. 995 signboard and saw that the steel rail had to be replaced, but there were no spare steel rails stored nearby. Carrying them from a distance would delay matters when the train came, and everyone was anxiously worried and had no solution. Zhou Yuxiang and Liu Rulin from the demonstration team had an idea in the midst of the chaos. They quickly sawed two wooden wedges from waste sleepers, clamped the broken steel rail in place, and nailed them in place, so that a troop train coming from Xinyang to the north could pass safely. Afterwards, they carried a steel rail from a distance and replaced it (according to the Zhengzhou "People's Railway" newspaper on March 15th).

### 人民热爱自己的铁路

　　人民热爱自己的铁路
    编辑同志：
    在今天，铁路是人民自己的，人民热爱着自己的铁路。我报告你们几件动人的故事吧。
    一、李清秀报警
    去年九月九日早晨，京汉路六九四号机车拉着三四五次客货混合列车从新乡开往郑州。火车走到新乡与小冀间，司机看见前面一个农民拿着块红布作信号警告他们，火车停下。那个农民名叫李清秀，那天早晨抱着孩子到地里看庄稼，看见铁路上的铁轨面断下三百六十公厘，知道火车过来必然出险。因此，他也顾不得看庄稼，就把孩子的红兜兜解下来作信号，等候火车开来好叫它停下。这样，这次列车因此得免于危险，旅客免于死亡，人民铁路免受损失。
    二、周家河村居民抢救路基
    京绥路张家口以西郭磊庄柴沟堡间有一座一七九号大桥，地处偏僻，附近村庄很多人是烟民，未解放前常发生抢劫偷盗事件。日寇和国民党反动派经常仰仗武力镇压，敲诈勒索，无所不为。解放后，人民铁警肖凤山班被派去看守一七九号大桥，帮助农民们拔麦子，挑水，修房子，摘大豆，使得农民非常感激；自动帮助护路，夜间轮流到铁路两旁巡逻。从此再也没人破坏和偷盗了。八月十五日半夜，正下大雨，周家河村的刘润兰到地里去察看庄稼是否被水冲坏，行近一七九号大桥，发现护路大坝被水冲坏。他马上回村报告。村长霍春廷立刻召集一百四十四个老百姓，拿着抢险的家伙，把冲坏的土坝挡上，然后掘开了三年多未通的涵洞，把水放出去，路基遂转危为安。村长等三个人还不放心，等列车开来，开灯告诉司机慢行，车才安全地驶过。第二天，他们又招呼来七十多个人，连续工作两天，挖了一条六尺宽一里多长的水沟，使水流入河内，路基再也不受水的侵害。
    三、胡兰英与示范队
    信阳工区示范队员张大成的老婆胡兰英，上街买菜回家，路过九九五道牌处，看见往北的第一根九公尺的钢轨，叫北下的列车压断了一节，她赶快甩下菜篮子，扭着小脚，往示范队干活的地方去报告，一口气跑了二公里。大家听了报告，就急忙跑向九九五道牌处一看，必须更换钢轨，但是附近没有存放备用钢轨，往远处去抬，又恐怕列车来了误事，大伙干着急没有办法。示范队周裕祥和刘汝林忙中生智，很快的利用废枕木锯了两个木橙，把压断的钢轨刚刚夹住钉好，使由信阳往北开来的一列兵车安全通过。随后他们又从远处抬来一条钢轨给换上了（根据三月十五日郑州《人民铁路》报）。
