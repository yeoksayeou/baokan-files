Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The National Conference of Young Pioneers Workers opened in Beijing on the 23rd. The main task of the conference is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned from Young Pioneers work in various regions since the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued its resolution on establishing the Chinese Young Pioneers in October last year.

The conference began with an opening speech by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. He pointed out that children pursue truth and ideals and are eager for multifaceted scientific knowledge. The Young Pioneers is an organization that provides children with scientific and revolutionary education in order to meet this need and is an organization for cultivating reserve forces for building a new society. Every Young Pioneers worker should fully recognize the far-reaching significance of this work and learn from the spirit of the female protagonist in the Soviet film "The Village Teacher," treating it as a lifelong career.

Following this, guests spoke. Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, said that it is the responsibility of the adult generation to cultivate noble sentiments, rich scientific knowledge, and sound physiques in young children. He especially called on national literary and art workers to create excellent works for children.

Vice Minister of Education Wei Que, Director of the Publishing Administration Hu Yuzhi, and Kang Keqing, representative of the Democratic Women's Federation, also spoke successively.

Attending the conference were 106 Young Pioneers workers from the six major administrative regions of East China, Northeast China, Central South China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and North China, 14 major cities including Shanghai and Beijing, rural areas, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Kazakh Autonomous Region, and the Inner Mongolia Mongolian Autonomous Region.
