Shangrao Concentration Camp

　　In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of more than 200,000 men launched a treacherous attack on the more than 10,000 soldiers of the New Fourth Army in southern Anhui, who were fighting hard to persist in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines north and south of the Yangtze River, creating the Anhui Incident that shocked China and foreign countries. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic people who were imprisoned at that time. He used his skilled brush, with strong hatred and love, to depict the facts he witnessed that day, forming the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The monstrous crimes of the Kuomintang secret service bandit gang and the heroic deeds of revolutionary fighters who would rather die than submit are powerfully expressed. This collection consists of twenty-three pieces, serialized in this edition. Twenty pieces have been published previously, and the twenty-first piece is published today.

    Chishi Uprising

    In June of the same year, the Kuomintang bandit army abandoned Shangrao without a fight, and the concentration camp also moved to Fujian. On the way, near Chishi, Chong'an, Fujian, next to the majestic Mount Wuyi and on the banks of the roaring river, the comrades launched another major uprising of more than a hundred people. A cry of "Charge!" was like the sound of thousands of troops and horses. Under the vicious howling of the Kuomintang secret service bandit gang's machine guns, the comrades crossed rice paddies, crossed mountains, and crossed grasslands, heading straight for the peaks of Wuyi.

    赤石暴动
    同年六月，国民党匪军不战而弃上饶，集中营亦向闽转移。途经福建崇安赤石附近，在雄伟的五夷山旁，滚滚的大河之滨，同志们又相继举行了百余人的大暴动，一声“冲啊！”犹如千军万马。在国民党特务匪帮机枪恶毒的叫啸下，同志们越过稻田，越过大岭，越过草莽，直奔五夷高峰。
