　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st, TASS dispatch: Pravda published a commentary on the so-called parliamentary "elections" held in Yugoslavia on March 26th, stating: It is quite obvious that the purpose of the Tito group staging this election farce is to attempt to create the impression through elections that the Yugoslav people support their fascist regime, which was established with the encouragement of foreign imperialists. Tito thoroughly imitated Hitler's memorable trick of so-called "referendums," conducting the elections amidst endless fascist terror and directly threatening voters to participate in this farce. In order to ensure a high percentage of voters participating in the "elections," residents in various regions were escorted to the polling stations by specially assigned "supervisors," whose responsibility was to use various means to ensure that the voters they were assigned to supervise participated in the elections. Soldiers were led to vote in lines under the command of officers.
　　Although the Tito group used terror to obtain the necessary votes, it cannot be said that the "election" results were favorable to the Tito elements. Even the apparently tampered figures from Yugoslav official sources prove that the Yugoslav working masses' resistance to Tito is growing. Particularly illustrative are the "election" results in Subotica, a major industrial center in the Vojvodina region, where 25.35 percent of voters in the first electoral district voted against Tito's candidates, 22.69 percent in the second district, and 30.22 percent in the third district. In the Bečej district, those who voted against accounted for 28.69 percent, and in the Senta district, 29.05 percent. The same situation exists in Ljubljana, Zagreb, Karlovac, and many other regions.
　　Based on their own experience, the Yugoslav people have long known that the so-called "People's Assembly" is no longer an organ of people's power. The assembly allowed the Tito group to destroy the fruits of people's democracy and establish a bloody fascist rule of terror and lawlessness in Yugoslavia. The newly elected assembly will be a combination of bourgeois nationalists, foreign spies, Chetnik elements, Ustashe elements, and other anti-people elements, whom the Tito gang has drawn around themselves in order to realize the plan of completely turning Yugoslavia into a bridgehead for imperialist aggression.
　　The Communists who remain loyal to socialism and democracy, and all true Yugoslav patriots, will draw the necessary conclusions from this election farce and prepare for a new and decisive struggle to bring Yugoslavia back to the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　真理报评南“选举”
    反铁托力量日益增长，忠于社会主义与民主的共产党人和爱国志士将为南斯拉夫重返民主阵营而准备新的斗争。
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三月三十一日讯：真理报就南斯拉夫三月二十六日举行的所谓议会“选举”发表评论称：十分显然，铁托集团上演这幕选举剧的目的，是在于企图用选举来创造一种印象，使人以为南斯拉夫人民拥护他们的在外国帝国主义者鼓励下建立的法西斯政权。铁托彻底仿效了希特勒所谓“全民投票”的记忆犹新的技俩，使选举在无休止的法西斯恐怖中进行，并直接威胁选民参加这幕滑稽剧。为了保证参加“选举”的选民占很高的百分率，各地居民们都由特别派定的“监督员”护送前往投票站，这些监督员的责任，就是用种种办法使指定由他们监督的选民参加选举。士兵则在军官的指挥下排队前往投票。
    铁托集团虽用恐怖手段获得了必要票数，但却不能说“选举”结果有利于铁托分子，即使是南斯拉夫官方的显然经过窜改的数字，也证明了南斯拉夫劳动群众反抗铁托的力量正日益增长。特别具有说明性的，便是伏伊伏迪纳地区大工业中心苏波蒂卡的“选举”结果，那里，第一选区有百分之二十五点三五的选民投票反对铁托的候选人，第二选区有百分之二十二点六九、第三选区有百分之三十点二二的选民投反对票。在别塞伊区，投反对票的人占百分之二十八点六九，在山塔区则占百分之二十九点零五。在留布梁尼、萨格勒布、卡洛瓦克及许多其他地区，也有相同的情形。
    南斯拉夫人民根据自己的经验，已经知道所谓“人民议会”很久以来就不是人民的权力机关了。议会容许铁托集团摧毁了人民民主的果实，而且在南斯拉夫建立了恐怖与无法无天的血腥的法西斯统治。新近选出的议会，将是资产阶级民族主义者、外国间谍、契特尼克分子、乌斯塔希分子以及其他反人民分子的结合，铁托匪帮把这些人拉拢在周围，便是为了实现把南斯拉夫完全变成帝国主义侵略的桥头堡的计划。
    仍然忠于社会主义与民主的共产党人、南斯拉夫一切真正的爱国志士，将从这次选举的滑稽剧中得出必要的结论，为争取南斯拉夫重返和平、民主与社会主义阵营而准备新的决定性的斗争。
