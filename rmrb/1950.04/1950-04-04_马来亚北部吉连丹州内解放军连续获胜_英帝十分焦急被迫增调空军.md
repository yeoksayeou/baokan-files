　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd: London newspapers are giving prominent coverage to news from the British colonial authorities in Singapore about setbacks suffered by the British army in Kelantan, northern Malaya. The "Workers' Daily," under the headline "Guerrillas Win Great Victory," reported on the March 25th attack by the Malayan National Liberation Army on British troops in Kelantan state. The battle lasted for six hours, resulting in 17 British soldiers and 4 policemen killed, with another 4 wounded and 11 missing. The guerrillas withdrew at their leisure. The paper stated: This is the biggest blow suffered by the British imperialists in twenty-two months of fighting.

　　The British bourgeois press expressed great anxiety over the victory of the Malayan people. The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" on March 27th, reporting on this battle news, complained: "Military commentators believe that the news from Malaya emphatically illustrates the complacent attitude of the authorities in the past. For a year, the authorities have repeatedly claimed that the situation is completely under control." The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" on March 27th, reporting on this battle, revealed: "The battle area is precisely the area used by the guerrillas active in Kelantan and Perak to consolidate their deployments. Military sources believe that approximately three thousand 'terrorists' are concentrated in this mountainous area."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Under the victorious attacks of the Malayan National Liberation Army, the British government is hastily deploying its suppression of the Malayan people. According to Reuter's reports: The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of "Anti-Banditry" Operations in Malaya, Lieutenant General Briggs, flew from London to Singapore on March 31st to uniformly command the colonial war against the Malayan people. Kelantan state in northern Malaya, with a population of 500,000, has been declared a "controlled area," prohibiting night transportation. The British Air Ministry has announced its decision to establish the "Royal Malayan Air Force." The Royal Air Force's 57th Lincoln Bomber Squadron, reinforced from Britain, arrived in Malaya in late March to formally participate in the fighting.

　　马来亚北部吉连丹州内解放军连续获胜
    英帝十分焦急被迫增调空军
    【新华社布拉格三日电】伦敦各报均以显著地位详载新加坡英殖民地当局发表英军在马来亚北部吉连丹受挫的消息。工人日报在《游击队获大胜》的标题下，报道马来亚民族解放军三月二十五日在吉连丹州袭击英军的消息。这次战斗持续六小时之久，结果英军十七人，警察四人被击毙，另有四人受伤，十一人失踪。游击队从容退走。该报称：这是二十二个月来作战中英帝国主义者所受到的最大一次打击。
    英国资产阶级报纸对于马来亚人民的胜利表示十分焦急。自由党的新闻纪事报三月二十七日在报道此一战讯时埋怨说：“军事评论家认为，马来亚的消息，着重地说明当局过去自满的态度。一年来，当局屡次声称局势完全可以控制。”保守党的每日邮报三月二十七日在报道这一战斗时透露：“战斗区域正是活动于吉连丹和霹雳州的游击队用以整顿部署的地区。军方相信，约有三千‘恐怖分子’，集中在这个山区里。”
    【新华社三日讯】在马来亚民族解放军胜利的出击下，英国政府正慌忙部署其对马来亚人民的镇压。综合路透社消息：新任马来亚“剿匪”作战总司令布雷格斯中将，已于三月三十一日自伦敦搭机赴新加坡，统一指挥对马来亚人民的殖民战争。马来亚北部有五十万人口的吉连丹州，已被宣布为“管制区”，禁止夜间运输。英国空军部已宣布决定成立“马来亚皇家空军队”。自英国增援的皇家空军第五十七林肯轰炸机中队，已于三月下旬抵马来亚，正式参加作战。
