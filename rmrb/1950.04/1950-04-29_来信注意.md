　　Notice Regarding Letters
　　When handling readers' letters, we adopt the method of individual replies for less common problems. However, recently, many of our reply letters have been returned by the post office because "no such person was found at the original address." This not only causes great difficulty for our work, but also wastes national manpower. Therefore, please be sure to write your real name and mailing address in future letters.

　　来信注意
    我们处理读者来信，对普遍性较小的问题，采取个别答复的方式。但最近我们有许多复信，都因“原址查无此人”而被邮局退回来了。这不但使我们的工作感到很大困难，且更浪费了国家的人力。为此，今后来信务请写明真实姓名和通讯处。
