Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th: TASS Washington, 26th: It is learned here that the U.S. State Department issued a circulated note to the governments of all Latin American countries several days ago, suggesting that they not recognize the Chinese People's Government. News sources here point out that these activities of the State Department are related to the U.S. government's intention to continue paralyzing the work of the Security Council and to the U.S. government's efforts to exclude the Chinese People's Government from participating in the drafting and conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.
