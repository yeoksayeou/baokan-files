    Zhangjiakou Public Enterprises Complete Tax Payment
    Over Thirty Government Agency Production Units Also Clear Tax Dues
    [Our Newspaper's Report] According to the April 5th Chahar Daily news: All state-owned and public enterprises in Zhangjiakou, in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax" and the "Provisional Measures for the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Tax by Public Enterprises" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, declared and paid taxes on schedule. The industrial and commercial tax for 1949 and January-February 1950 has been completed in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's instruction to complete it by the end of March. The twenty-five taxable enterprises, on March 31st, paid 100% of the tax due – 517,841,825 yuan for 1949 and 1,006,148,787 yuan for January-February 1950. All cash has now been handed over to the national treasury. The primary reason why the tax revenue plan of various public enterprises could be completed on schedule and in full was the importance attached to tax work by the Party and government leadership. After the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Tax by Public Enterprises," the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee immediately convened responsible cadres from various enterprise units to convey the spirit of the central tax policy, calling on them to complete tax payment as a political task. In mid-March, the provincial and municipal tax bureaus successively convened responsible persons from various public enterprises and production units of various agencies to explain the state's tax policy, arrange work, and encourage each unit to boldly raise any difficulties they anticipated encountering in tax payment for everyone to discuss. During the raising of questions, some units expressed the view that tax payment was a troublesome matter, and that whether or not taxes were paid was all for the state, so why bother with complicated procedures; some believed that enterprises were public and should be "special" or "exceptional"; and some believed that completing tax payments would prevent the completion of profit plans, or that funds would not be able to circulate, affecting business development and other erroneous ideas. However, these issues were finally resolved through full deliberation, organized study, and discussion. Furthermore, a new ideology and attitude towards financial and economic work was established by connecting with reality and examining thoughts, laying a good ideological foundation for completing the tax task 100% on schedule.

    Another reason is the high degree of revolutionary consciousness of the public enterprise cadres. For example, Yang Shude, manager of the state-owned Inner Mongolia Tea and Tobacco Company, said: "The state-owned economy leads the private economy, and we should also be at the forefront in complying with national policies and laws." As a result, the company paid all taxes due on February 9th. Furthermore, Chahar Daily and the Telecommunications Bureau are also examples of proactively paying taxes ahead of schedule.

    A further reason is the tax cadres themselves being proactive and diligent, not afraid of encountering setbacks and cold cynicism for the sake of their work. After the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Tax by Public Enterprises," each unit was notified to complete the procedures. Actively helping certain units that had difficulty estimating the value of assets and goods, and where there were some technical difficulties in making declarations; using telephones, letters, and cadres personally going down to supervise are also important conditions for the successful completion of the task.
    [Another Report] The thirty-five factories, workshops and other production units affiliated to various agencies in Zhangjiakou have cleared the industrial and commercial tax for January and February. The method adopted by the Municipal Tax Bureau for allocating the burden to these units is to rely on the self-awareness of each unit, adopting self-declaration and actual payment, combined with key account audits. According to regulations, the industrial and commercial tax for January and February should have been completed before March 10th, but although some units declared on time, they emphasized many objective reasons and delayed payment, which also affected the on-time completion of the tax revenue plan. Based on the above situation, the Municipal Tax Bureau applied for approval from higher authorities to require that all payments be completed before March 20th. However, some units still failed to complete the payment on time. Some responsible cadres said, "We have already declared, what does it matter if the allocated amount is paid a day earlier or later?" Some cadres even held the attitude that "delaying payment for a few days will allow the funds to circulate once more, earning a little more money." This clearly shows an insufficient understanding of the state's tax policy. The Municipal Tax Bureau has penalized these units for late payment in accordance with the regulations and notified the relevant authorities to supervise and inspect. Units penalized for delaying tax payments include the Hui Cooperative, the Desert Soap Factory, the Yuhua Flour Mill, the Xinhua Factory, the Xinhua Flour Shop, and the Dahua Printing Bureau. After the relevant authorities supervised and inspected these units, and after studying the relevant financial and tax documents promulgated by the central government, their thinking was straightened out and their attitude also changed. Those with cash paid it immediately, and those without cash actively borrowed or sold goods to prepare funds. For example, the Dahua Printing Bureau, lacking cash, obtained the consent of its employees to temporarily delay the issuance of a portion of their wages and reduce expenses, and also strived to pay all taxes and fines by the 31st. Except for the Hui Cooperative and the Desert Soap Factory, which genuinely lacked funds and submitted a statement to the tax bureau promising to pay by April 5th, the remaining thirty-three units paid a total of 574 million yuan in taxes and fines by the 31st, which has all been handed over to the national treasury.

　　领导重视·干部自觉·税局努力
    张市公营企业完成纳税
    三十余个机关生产单位亦已缴清税款
    【本报讯】据四月五日察哈尔日报消息：张家口各国营、公营企业，按照中央人民政府政务院颁布的工商业税暂行条例及公营企业缴纳工商业税暂行办法，按期申报缴纳税款。一九四九年工商业税和一九五零年一、二月份工商业税已按照财政部限三月底完成的指示，二十五个应税企业，于三月三十一日将应税之一九四九年五亿一千七百八十四万一千八百二十五元和一九五○年一、二月份之十亿零六千一百四十八万七千八百八十七元百分之百的缴清，现全部现金已解缴国库。此次各公营企业税收计划之所以能按期如数完成，党政领导上重视税收工作是一个主要原因。在政务院颁布了公营企业缴纳工商业税暂行办法后，省府财经委员会即召集各企业单位的负责干部，传达了中央税收精神，号召将纳税作为一个政治任务去完成。省、市税务局于三月中旬曾先后召集各公营企业和各机关之生产单位负责人解释国家税收政策，布置工作，启发各单位将纳税当中估计要碰到那些困难问题，大胆提出，大家漫谈。在提问题中，有些单位也曾表现了认为税收是件麻烦事，交不交都是国家的，何必交来交去，增加繁杂手续，多此一举；有的认为企业是公家的，应当“特殊”“例外”；有的则认为完成税收，则不能完成利润计划，或资金不能周转，影响业务开展等错误思想。但这些问题经充分酝酿、组织学习、讨论终于得到解决。并从连系实际，检查思想中，树立新的财经工作思想与态度。给百分之百的按期完成税收任务，打下了良好的思想基础。
    另外是依靠公营企业干部高度的革命自觉性。如国营内蒙古茶烟公司经理杨澍德就说：“国营经济是领导私营经济的，在遵守国家政策法令上，我们也应当站在最前列。”致该公司于二月九日即全部缴清税款。再如察哈尔日报社、电讯局等也是提前积极纳税的范例。
    再一个原因是税务干部本身积极努力，为了工作，不怕碰软钉子和冷讽热嘲，自政务院颁布了公营企业缴纳工商业税暂行办法后，即通知各单位办理手续。对某些单位资财、货物难于估价，进行申报中存在若干技术上的困难主动予以帮助；运用电话、信函，干部亲自下去督促等也是胜利完成任务的重要条件。
    【又讯】张家口各机关所属之三十五个工厂、作坊等生产单位已缴清一、二月份工商业税。市税局对这些单位分配负担的方法是依靠各单位的自觉性，采取自报实缴，结合重点查账。一、二月份工商业税，照章应在三月十日以前完成，但有些单位虽然按期申报了，可是强调许多客观原因，而迟迟不缴，以致也影响了税收计划的按期完成。市税务局根据上述情况，申请上级批准，限期三月二十日以前全部缴清。但有些单位仍未按期完成，有的负责干部说：“我们已申报了，分配的数字，迟一天早一天有啥关系？”还有的干部甚至抱着“迟缴几天，资金多周转一次，就多赚几个钱”的态度。这显然是对国家税收政策认识不足。市税局对这些单位已照章处以滞纳金。并通知各有关机关督促检查。计拖延纳税受罚者有回民合作社、沙漠肥皂厂、裕华面粉厂新华工厂、新华粉房、大华印刷局等单位。这些单位经有关机关之督促检查，学习了中央颁布的有关财政税收文件，思想搞通，态度也有了转变。有现款者马上缴清，无现款者也积极借贷、销货备款。如大华印刷局无现款而商得职工同意，暂先迟发一部工资，节约开支，也争取将税款、罚款于三十一日全部缴清。上述被罚单位除回民合作社、沙漠肥皂厂确系无款，向税局具结，四月五日以前缴清外，其余三十三个单位应税款与罚款共五亿七千四百余万元，已于三十一日全部解缴国库。
