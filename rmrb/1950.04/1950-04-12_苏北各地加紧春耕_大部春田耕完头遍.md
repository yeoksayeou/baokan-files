Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. Spring ploughing production campaigns have been widely launched in various parts of northern Jiangsu, and most of the spring fields have been plowed for the first time.

In carrying out the spring ploughing production campaign, all localities have paid attention to deeply mobilizing and organizing the labor force. In the old areas with better production conditions, the masses of farmers have been further organized to carry out spring ploughing production. For example, the farmers in Cangtou Village, Chengxi Township, Yancheng Prefecture, reorganized the old mutual aid teams during the spring ploughing, and organized mutual assistance in plowing between households without cattle and between old cattle households and cattle-sharing households under the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit and equal value exchange." A total of eleven plows were formed in the whole village, so that the 792 mu of paddy fields in the village were plowed for the first time by the end of March. The Mazhuang team of Fumin Township, Huaiyin County, specifically stipulated the ratio of manual labor to cattle labor, which solved the difficulty of lack of animal power for households without cattle. Now most of the 450 mu of spring fields in the whole team have been plowed. Farmers in Gaogou District, Lianshui, also solved the problem of lack of labor for families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, working cadres, and river workers, as well as widowed, orphaned, and childless households in the district, by organizing manpower and cattle power, and implementing methods such as substitute cultivation and mutual aid exchange of labor.

In the new areas, local people's governments first widely publicized spring ploughing production and labor to build a prosperous family, dispelling farmers' production concerns. For example, after Taixian County publicized the above-mentioned production policies through people's representatives conferences at all levels, the production enthusiasm of the farmers stabilized. Farmers in Sunliu Township in the county sent hundreds of boats every day to dredge mud from the river to make fertilizer. Now, among the more than 7,000 mu of fields in the township, more than 6,000 mu have been fertilized for the last time, and more than 3,000 mu have also been weeded.

The people in the disaster areas, who have more production difficulties, are actively trying to overcome the difficulties in spring ploughing and seize the season to carry out spring ploughing in a timely manner under the leadership of the local people's government. For example, in the severely affected areas of Shuyang County, seeds and animal power are in very short supply, and most of the able-bodied laborers in the county cannot return home in time for spring ploughing due to their participation in the Yi River harnessing project. At present, the county people's government has lent 1.3 million jin of seeds, basically solving the seed difficulties of the victims in the severely affected areas. The county people's government, the Shuyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Shuyang County Production and Disaster Relief Committee also held meetings to mobilize spring ploughing, find all ways to solve the difficulties of the victims lacking labor and food, and decided to mobilize able-bodied laborers, semi-able-bodied laborers, women, and children in the lightly affected areas to participate in spring ploughing production, and implement human power to replace cattle power, and advocate the free borrowing and equal value exchange of cattle power, to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power; At the same time, it was decided to mobilize mutual assistance among the families of river workers, mutual assistance between the families of river workers and other farmers using human power and cattle power, or to solve the problem of families of river workers who cannot return home due to their participation in guiding the Yi River by contracting cultivation and planting by the masses. For the victims without food, it has been decided to increase the relief grain by half a catty every day during the spring ploughing, so that they have the strength to carry out spring ploughing. Through the above methods, the difficulties in spring ploughing production of the victims in the county have been basically resolved. The spring ploughing campaign has been launched throughout the county. At present, most of the spring fields in northern Jiangsu have been plowed once or twice, and the dry land in Huaiyin, Yancheng and other prefectures will soon be sown.

　　苏北各地加紧春耕
    大部春田耕完头遍
    【新华社上海十日电】苏北各地的春耕生产运动普遍展开，大部春田已耕完头遍。
    各地在开展春耕生产运动中，都注意深入动员和组织劳动力。在生产条件较好的老区，农民群众已进一步地组织起来进行春耕生产。如盐城专区城西乡仓头村农民，在春耕中整理了旧有的互助组，并组织没牛户之间、老牛户与伙牛户之间，在“自愿互利、等价交换”的原则下进行互助拉犁。全村共组成了十一张犁，使该村七百九十二亩水田在三月底就耕完了头遍。淮阴县福民乡马庄小组，具体规定了人工换牛工的比价，使无牛户解决了缺乏畜力的困难，现全组四百五十亩春田已大部耕完。涟水高沟区农民也以组织人力、牛力，实行代耕、互助换工等办法，解决了全区革命烈士、军人、工作干部家属和河工家属以及鳏寡孤独户缺乏劳动力的困难。
    在新区，各地人民政府首先广泛宣传了春耕生产、劳动发家，打破农民群众生产顾虑。例如泰县通过各界人民代表会议宣传了上述的生产政策后，农民群众的生产情绪即稳定下来。该县孙刘乡农民每天出动了几百只船在河里罱泥渣做肥料。现全乡七千多亩田中，已有六千多亩施了最后一次肥，其中三千多亩并且已经薅好草。
    生产困难较多的灾区人民，在当地人民政府领导下，积极设法克服春耕中的困难，抓紧季节，及时春耕。如沭阳县重灾区，种籽、畜力都感到非常缺乏，该县大部分全劳动力也因参加治沂工程不能及时回家春耕。现该县人民政府贷放数达一百三十万斤种籽，基本上解决了重灾区灾民的种籽困难。该县人民政府、中共沭阳县委和沭阳县生产救灾委员会又分别召开会议，进行春耕动员，想出一切办法解决灾民缺乏劳力和口粮的困难，决定以发动轻灾区全劳动力、半劳动力、妇女、儿童参加春耕生产，并实行人力代牛力，提倡牛力自由借、等价换的办法，来解决劳、畜力的困难；同时决定对因参加导沂而不能回家的河工家属，以动员河工家属间互相帮助、河工家属与其他农民群众实行人力与牛力互助、或由群众包耕包种的办法来解决，对无粮灾民，已决定在春耕时每天增发救济粮半斤，使其有力量进行春耕。通过以上办法，该县灾民春耕生产困难已基本上获得解决。春耕运动已在全县展开。现苏北全区大部春田已耕过一遍至两遍，淮阴、盐城等专区的旱田并即将进行播种。
