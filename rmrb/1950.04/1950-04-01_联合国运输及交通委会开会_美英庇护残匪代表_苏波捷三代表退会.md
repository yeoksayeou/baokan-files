　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 30th: The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Transport and Communications Committee convened on the 27th. The first to speak was Soviet representative Klimov, who supported the just demand of the government of the People's Republic of China and proposed that the Transport and Communications Committee expel the Kuomintang clique's representatives, as it cannot represent China or the Chinese people. The representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia seconded the Soviet proposal. The Dutch representative, serving as chairman, expressed the desire of the United States delegation to treat this issue as a procedural matter. He decided that the committee could not make any decision on the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union. He put his decision to a vote, and eleven delegations—including the US delegation—voted in favor of his decision. It is well known that the representatives of Britain, India, Pakistan, and other countries, which have severed diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang clique and recognized the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, voted with the United States to support the chairman's decision, thus shielding the Kuomintang clique that had been driven out of China by the Chinese people. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against this decision. After the vote, Soviet representative Klimov declared: Because the majority of the committee opposed the Soviet proposal to expel the Kuomintang clique's representatives from the committee, he is authorized to announce that as long as the Kuomintang representatives continue to be members of the committee, the Soviet representative cannot participate in the work of the Transport and Communications Committee. Furthermore, the Soviet Union will consider the resolutions made by the committee in the presence of the Kuomintang clique to be invalid and will not be bound by these resolutions. The Soviet representative then left the meeting. The representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia also withdrew after delivering similar speeches.

　　联合国运输及交通委会开会
    美英庇护残匪代表     
    苏波捷三代表退会
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：联合国经社理事会所属运输及交通委员会，于二十七日开会。第一个发言的是苏联代表克利莫夫，他支持中华人民共和国政府的同一的要求，并提议运输及交通委员会将国民党集团的代表开除出去，因为它不能代表中国或中国人民。波兰与捷克的代表附议苏联的提议。担任主席的荷兰代表，表示了美国代表团的愿望，把这一问题当作程序问题处理，他决定该委员会不能就苏联所提出的建议案作何决定。他把他的决定提付表决，有十一个代表团——包括美国代表团在内——投票赞成他的决定。人所共知，已与国民党集团断绝了外交关系并承认了中华人民共和国中央人民政府的英国、印度、巴基斯坦等国的代表们，与美国一同投票赞成主席的决定，因而庇护了那已被中国人民逐出了中国的国民党集团。苏联、波兰与捷克的代表们投票反对这个决定。在投票后，苏联代表克里莫夫宣称：由于委员会的大多数反对苏联所提自委员会中开除国民党集团代表的提议，他受权宣布，只要国民党代表继续为该委员会委员时，苏联代表即不能参加交通与运输委员会的工作，并且，苏联将认为委员会在国民党集团出席时所作的决议无效，并将不受这些决议的约束。苏联代表随即退出会场。波兰及捷克的代表们在发表了同样的演说后也即退席。
