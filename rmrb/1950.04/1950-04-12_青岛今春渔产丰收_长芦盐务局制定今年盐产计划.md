    长芦盐务局制定今年盐产计划
    【新华社青岛十一日电】青岛今春渔产丰收，渔民欣喜异常。近日黄花、红头、扁口等鱼已源源上市，每天成交达四千余箱，约十八万余斤。一位渔民兴奋地说：“这是共产党给咱带来的福。”现山东水产公司已筹设鲜鱼盐制部，及时腌制咸鱼。为扶助渔民进行生产，山东省人民政府今春曾发放渔业贷款八千万元、渔轮二十只、帆船百余只，使渔民能够及时下海捕鱼。
    【新华社天津十一日电】长芦盐务管理局根据中央人民政府关于全国盐务工作的决定，制订了长芦盐区今年全年产盐计划。计划规定该区公私盐场今年共产盐一千三百七十六万担；较中央原定任务增加七十六万担。该计划并强调提高质量，严格要求氯化钠不得低于百分之九十（较国民党统治时期食盐标准提高百分之五），并争取达到百分之九十三。
