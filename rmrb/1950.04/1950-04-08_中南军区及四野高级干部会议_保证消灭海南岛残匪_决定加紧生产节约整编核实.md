Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 4th: The People's Liberation Army's Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army held a high-level cadre meeting in March, which has great historical significance since the liberation of the Central South Region. The meeting discussed in detail the work tasks of the armed forces in the Central South Region in 1950, the suppression of bandits, troop production and reorganization, and rectification training. The meeting listened to reports from Tan Zheng, Third Political Commissar of the Fourth Field Army and Central South Military Region, on "The Work Tasks of the Armed Forces in the Central South Military Region in 1950," Chief of Staff Zhao Erlu on "The Report on Completing the Task of Suppressing Bandits and the Reorganization Plan," and Director of the Political Department Tao Zhu on "The Report on Troop Rectification Training." After heated discussions in groups and in the general assembly, all unanimously agreed with and supported the guidelines and spirit of the above reports. Finally, Tan Zheng made a summary, and Deng Zihui, Second Political Commissar, delivered a speech entitled "The Current Tasks of the Central South Region and the Issue of the Troop Work Team System."

The meeting expressed its firm determination to implement and fully guarantee the resolution of the Central South Military and Political Committee, which pointed out that "the primary military task this year is to organize the sea-crossing operation and eliminate the remaining enemy on Hainan Island." After studying the current bandit suppression situation in the Central South Region, the meeting decided to eliminate bandits in areas where there are still bandits operating in the first half of this year, and to eliminate scattered bandits in areas where bandits have already been eliminated, so as not to affect farmers' spring plowing and the implementation of social reforms this winter.

**Cultural Education Should Be the Main Content of Rectification Training; Otherwise, It Will Be Impossible to Master Modern Warfare Technology**

The meeting held a detailed discussion on the post-war rectification training that is about to begin. Everyone unanimously agreed with the general principle of "taking cultural education as the main content of troop training in the next few years," because learning culture and improving cultural levels are urgently needed by the troops and are a crucial issue related to the future development of the troops. Without solving the cultural problem, it will be impossible to learn and even more impossible to master modern military technology and command art, which will greatly limit the political and military development of cadres and troops. Based on this principle and requirement, the meeting decided to universally raise the cultural level of soldiers to the level of higher primary school graduates within three years, and that of cadres to the level of junior high school graduates, with the level of senior high school graduates as the goal. To this end, in addition to setting up preparatory courses in military and political universities to make up for cultural deficiencies, cultural accelerated schools (off-the-job study) should be set up at the army and division levels, cultural supplementary schools (on-the-job study) should be set up at the regiment level and in various directly subordinate units, and cultural learning should be universally carried out in companies. These three methods will be used to conduct formal cultural learning throughout the army. The meeting also explicitly decided that during the key period for the implementation of cultural education (at least within one year), cultural education should account for 70 percent of the total time, while military and political education combined should account for 30 percent, avoiding the equal emphasis on all subjects, so as to achieve the concentrated effect of cultural education. At the same time, the meeting estimated that some incorrect ideological tendencies might arise in the troops after the war, affecting national defense construction. Therefore, it was decided to first carry out ideological and political education in a relatively short period of time (two or three months), focusing on patriotic education, establishing the idea of a national defense army serving national defense, and overcoming some erroneous ideas that are not conducive to national defense construction, such as complacency as meritorious officials, relaxation and disorganization, greed for enjoyment, and demobilization emotions.

The meeting particularly pointed out that this year is the most difficult year for our country's finances, and we must conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on troops participating in production this year and resolutely implement the decision of the Central People's Government's State Council on unifying national financial and economic work. The entire army must intensify production, practice strict economy, reorganize its structure, verify its numbers, and clear its warehouses. In this way, we will not only be able to overcome the difficulties this year, but also be able to create good material conditions for the entire army's rectification training in the future.

**We Must Not Be Intoxicated with Victory; We Must Maintain the Purity of the People's Army**

In his summary, Tan Zheng particularly warned everyone not to be arrogant and complacent because of victory, not to relax and slack off because of victory, and even more not to lose the glorious tradition and fine style of hard work, plain living, and heroic struggle of the past because of victory. He said that we must not be intoxicated with victory. Our tasks are still arduous, and our work is still heavy. We must always have a calm mind and a humble attitude, dare to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, prevent the erosion of bad tendencies such as warlordism, bureaucracy, liberalism, lack of organization and discipline, and maintain the purity and unity of our people's army, so as to victoriously complete the important tasks we are undertaking.

**Formulate Specific Measures to Effectively Implement the Decision on Unified Financial and Economic Work**

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 4th: The People's Liberation Army's Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army have formulated specific measures to effectively implement the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work. After the State Council issued its decision on unifying national financial and economic work, the CCP Central South Military Region Party Committee immediately discussed implementation measures, and the military region and the logistics departments of each army also conducted studies in conjunction with reviewing their work. The specific measures of the CCP Central South Military Region Party Committee on implementing the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work, which were passed at the recent high-level cadre meeting of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army, stipulate that all troops, except those engaged in the sea-crossing operation to liberate Hainan Island, must ensure the completion of the production tasks turned over to the public as stipulated by the CCP Central South Military Region Party Committee. All levels of leadership organs should economize on all unnecessary expenses, oppose corruption and extravagance and waste, on the principle of ensuring the necessary expenses for the life and work of all personnel. The measures stipulate that, except for the troops engaged in the sea-crossing operation, which will be guaranteed supply according to standards, the office miscellaneous expenses of other troops and organs in March, April, and May will be reduced and issued uniformly. From March to August, each person must also save one or two liang of food per day. All troops should immediately begin to reorganize their structures, verify the existing personnel, vehicles, and horses, eliminate false reports and estimates, begin to change the phenomenon of certain agencies being large and bloated, and immediately stop the phenomenon of various agencies and troops adding personnel and recruiting people to start training courses without approval; appropriately handle the liberated soldiers and miscellaneous troops who are in training; re-determine the number of local armed forces and reduce those exceeding the regulations, focusing on the development of people's armed forces that do not leave production (i.e., militia). Clean up the warehouse materials of the military region, each army, and each provincial military region, and uniformly allocate them. Part of the subsidies will be issued in kind at a discounted price, and the management of weapons, ammunition, and barracks will be strengthened. All cadres attending the high-level cadre meeting unanimously believed that it is necessary to carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army in loving the motherland, loving the people, and working hard, and with the consistent spirit of perseverance in overcoming difficulties, resolutely implement the decisions and measures of the State Council and the CCP Central South Military Region Party Committee, overcome the current temporary financial difficulties, and facilitate the rapid recovery and development of the people's economic undertakings.

　　中南军区及四野高级干部会议
    保证消灭海南岛残匪 
    决定加紧生产节约整编核实
    【新华社汉口四日电】人民解放军中南军区及第四野战军于三月间举行了中南区解放以来具有重大历史意义的高级干部会议。会议详细地讨论了有关中南区武装部队一九五○年工作任务、肃清土匪、部队生产和整编、整训等问题。会议先后听取了第四野战军兼中南军区第三政治委员谭政《关于一九五○年中南军区武装部队工作任务的报告》、参谋长赵尔陆《关于完成剿匪任务与整编方案的报告》、政治部主任陶铸《关于部队整训问题的报告》。经过小组和大会的热烈讨论，全体一致同意和拥护上述报告的方针和精神。最后由谭政作总结，并由第二政治委员邓子恢作了《中南区当前任务与部队工作队化问题》的讲话。
    会议对于中南军政委员会决议中所指出的“今年在军事方面的任务首先就是组织渡海作战，消灭海南岛上的残余敌人”，表示将坚决执行，并给以完全的保证。会议在研究了目前中南地区的剿匪形势后，决定要在今年上半年内在尚有股匪的地区消灭股匪，在股匪已经消灭的地区肃清散匪，以免影响农民春耕及今冬社会改革的实行。
    要以文化教育为整训的主要内容  不然就不能掌握现代化作战技术
    会议对于即将开始的战后整训问题作了详尽的讨论。大家一致同意“以文化教育作为今后数年内部队训练的主要内容”的总方针，因为学习文化、提高文化是部队目前所迫切需要的，又是关系部队今后发展的一个带着关键性的问题。不解决文化问题就不可能学会、更不可能掌握现代化的军事技术和指挥艺术，就使干部和部队在政治上、军事上的发展受到极大的限制。根据这个方针和要求，会议决定在三年内普遍提高战士文化水平到高小毕业的程度，干部提高到初中毕业的程度，而以高中毕业程度作为努力目标。为此，除军政大学设预科以补习文化外，应在军、师两级设立文化速成学校（离职学习），在团及各级直属部队设立文化补习学校（在职学习），在连队则应普遍进行文化学习，经过这三种方式来进行全军正规的文化学习。会议并明确决定在实施文化教育重点期内（至少在一年内）文化教育应占总时间百分之七十，军事政治合占百分之三十，避免各门功课平列，以收文化教育集中之效。同时会议估计到战后部队中可能产生某些不正确的思想倾向，影响国防建设，因而决定首先在较短时间（两三个月）内进行思想政治教育，以爱国主义教育为中心，建立为国防服务的国防军思想，克服某些以功臣自居、松弛涣散、贪图享乐及复员情绪等不利于国防建设的错误思想。
    会议特别指出：今年是我国财政最困难的一年，必须认真执行毛主席关于今年部队参加生产的指示与坚决执行中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济的决定。全军必须加紧生产、厉行节约、整理编制、核实人数、清理仓库，这样，不但能够渡过今年的难关，并且将能够为今后全军整训创造很好的物质条件。
    我们决不能沉醉于胜利  要保持人民军队的纯洁
    谭政在总结中特别告诫大家不要因为胜利而骄傲自满，不要因为胜利而松弛懈怠，更不要因为胜利而丧失过去艰苦朴素、英勇奋斗的光荣传统和优良作风。他说，我们决不能沉醉于胜利，我们的任务还是艰巨的，工作还是繁重的，必须经常具有冷静头脑和谦虚态度，勇于使用批评与自我批评的武器，防止军阀主义、官僚主义、自由主义、无组织无纪律等等不良倾向的侵染，保持我们人民军队的纯洁和统一，以胜利地完成我们所担负的重大任务。
    订出具体办法切实执行统一财经决定
    【新华社汉口四日电】人民解放军中南军区及第四野战军已订出具体办法，切实执行政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定。政务院统一国家财经工作决定发布后，中共中南军区党委即讨论了执行办法，军区及各军后勤部亦均结合对本单位工作的检讨进行了学习。月前中南军区及第四野战军高级干部会议上通过的中共中南军区党委关于执行政务院统一国家财经工作决定的具体办法中规定，全军部队除担任渡海解放海南岛作战的部队外，要保证完成中南军区党委所规定的生产交公任务，各级领导机关在保障全体人员生活及工作必需的开支原则下，应撙节一切不必要的费用，反对贪污和铺张浪费。办法规定：除渡海作战部队按标准保证供给外，其他各部队及机关在三、四、五月份内的办公杂支经费均一律核减发给。三月份至八月份每人每日并须节约食粮一两。各部队应立即开始整理编制，核实现有人员、车辆、马匹，消灭虚报估计数字，着手改变某些机构的庞大臃肿现象，并立即停止各机关部队未经批准而自行添加人员和招人开办训练班等现象；适当处理在训练中的解放官兵与游杂部队；重新确定地方武装数额，超过规定者予以削减，着重发展不脱离生产的人民武装（即民兵）。清理军区各军及各省军区的仓库物资，并统一调配。津贴中部分代以物品折价发给，加强武器弹药、营房的管理工作。出席高干会的全体干部均一致认为必须发扬人民解放军爱祖国、爱人民、艰苦勤劳的优良传统，以一贯克服困难的坚忍精神，坚决执行政务院及中共中南军区党委的决定和办法，渡过目前暂时的财政难关，以利人民经济事业的迅速恢复和发展。
