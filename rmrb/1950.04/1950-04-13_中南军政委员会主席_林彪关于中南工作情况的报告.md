Xinhua News Agency, April 12th:
Chairman Lin Biao of the Central South Military and Political Committee's Report on the Work of Central South China (April 11, 1950, at the Sixth Meeting of the Central People's Government), the full text is as follows: Chairman, fellow members:

Committee member Deng Zihui has already reported on the opening process and general situation of work in the Central South Region at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government. I will only report on a few major events in the past few months:

　　Part of Our Army Lands on Hainan Island for Combat, the Rest Engage in Suppressing Bandits, Training, and Production

　　(1) Since December 12th of last year, when our People's Liberation Army occupied Zhennanguan, ending the largest and most arduous Guangxi-Guangdong annihilation campaign in the Central South region, the task of our army, in addition to continuing preparations for and conducting the landing operation on Hainan Island, has been to redeploy according to national defense and security needs. Part of the army is engaged in suppressing bandits, while others are engaged in training and production. In the Guangxi-Guangdong pursuit and annihilation campaign, our army demonstrated a high degree of heroism and perseverance. Many units marched over 200 li in a single day, and some marched continuously for as many as 25 days, finally catching up with the extremely rapidly fleeing enemy and bandit troops, achieving the goal of encirclement and annihilation. The Bai Chongxi bandit forces, known for their stubbornness and cunning, have been completely annihilated, except for a very small portion that escaped the mainland. After the end of the campaign, the troops were immediately assigned to new tasks without rest. Currently, part of our army has landed on Hainan Island and is continuing preparations for the Hainan Island operation. Bandit suppression, including the previous period of bandit suppression in various places, has resulted in the annihilation of more than 390,000 people. There are still a few remaining bandits to be eliminated urgently. Thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and high concern, the establishment of the Central People's Government, and the nationwide victory and enthusiastic assistance of the people, the morale of our army is very high. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, brought back by Chairman Mao recently, has greatly inspired the soldiers of our army and the broad masses of people in the Central South region. Regarding the issue of troop production, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, except for the troops engaged in the Hainan Island operation who are exempt from production tasks, the others are divided into five different standards for paying public grain according to the task situation and the objective conditions of the location. The highest standard is an average of 500 jin of rice per person, and the lowest is 30 jin of rice. In addition, we are directly organizing the construction of two major water conservancy projects, the upper reaches of the Xiang River and the Ying River in the Yellow River flooded area. The surplus transportation tools are organized for transportation production, assisting the government in transporting public grain for export, and it is planned to undertake the repair of one or two highways and several railway branch lines with the available labor force. The troops responsible for bandit suppression are all planning to complete the task of eliminating bandits within a set time limit. All troops are also acting as work teams, assisting local governments and local cadres in mobilizing the masses and gradually carrying out social reforms, according to the local possibilities and necessities.

　　Most Counties and Cities Have Held Representative Conferences, Which are Beneficial to the People's Democratic Dictatorship System

　　(2) In February, the first meeting of the Central South Military and Political Committee was held, adopting the work tasks for the Central South Region in 1950 and the organizational regulations of the Military and Political Committee, revising and adopting regulations on rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and equipping the list of important personnel of the Military and Political Committee and its various departments and the list of the people's government committees of each province, all of which have been submitted to the Central People's Government for review and promulgation.

　　Most counties and cities have already held people's representative conferences from all walks of life. Henan and Jiangxi have all held one meeting. Thirty-six counties in Hubei and twenty-eight counties in Hunan have also held meetings. Some have held two meetings, and some cities have held as many as twelve. In the six provinces of Central South China, except for a small number of counties that are still disturbed by bandits and temporarily difficult to hold meetings, it is planned to hold another people's representative conference in the first half of this year. Henan Province is holding a provincial people's representative conference to elect the provincial people's government. The people's representative conferences of Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and the two cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou are also being prepared for convening. Township farmers' representative conferences have been widely held. Some townships have held more than ten meetings. According to incomplete materials from the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, the number of representatives participating in township farmers' representative conferences is approximately 500,000 (calculated as one person per participation). Hubei has already held a provincial farmers' representative conference, Henan is holding one, and Jiangxi and other provinces are also preparing to convene one. Workers, women, and youth in cities have held, or are planning to hold, representative conferences. Experience has shown that using the method of systematically convening people's representative conferences from all walks of life to connect with the broad masses of people and implement the people's democratic system, all important government measures and the universal and urgent demands of the local people, such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and interest rates, distributing land, collecting grain taxes, and producing for disaster relief, are discussed and approved through representative conferences to assist the government in implementing policies and laws, which is much better than not holding these meetings or only holding cadre meetings. Further, electing local people's governments through people's representative conferences from all walks of life and uniting people from all strata and their representatives will be of great benefit to our people's democratic dictatorship system. However, many of our government workers at all levels are not very familiar with this method, and some meetings are not well conducted, and some have made mistakes of formalism. The Central South Military and Political Committee will continuously summarize and correct the implementation experience and help governments and people's organizations at all levels to gradually hold these meetings well.

　　Most of the Public Grain Has Been Completed, and Tax Revenue Has Exceeded the Task

　　(3) The task of collecting public grain has been fully completed in Hubei, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and more than 50% has been completed in Guangdong and Guangxi. Tax revenue has completed the tasks for 1949 and January and February of this year, with a slight excess. Twenty million shares of public bonds have been actually sold, accounting for more than 66% of the original target of 30 million shares. Due to the completion of the collection task, public bonds, and other necessary measures, the goal of coordinating the whole country, balancing revenue and expenditure, and stabilizing prices has been initially achieved. However, some mistakes were still made in the specific work. For example, in the collection of grain, due to the initial opening of the new area, there were few cadres and insufficient understanding of the situation, resulting in excessively light or heavy phenomena. Due to the relationship between the Baojia system, the burden on farmers in many places was too heavy, and in some places, too much was levied on certain landlords or other people, and there were also excessively light or heavy phenomena in the region. There were also some similar situations in tax revenue. We attach great importance to these situations. The original Central Plains Provisional People's Government has issued a proclamation on the situation of grain collection. When the Military and Political Committee held a meeting, it also made a report, analysis, and discussion on the situation at that time. The recently convened financial and economic conference, in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, inspected and discussed the situation in the entire region and formulated a plan for collection and compilation in 1950. Some bad phenomena have occurred among the cadres, especially among the old staff, and we are planning to rectify the cadres to overcome corruption, waste, and the style of not conducting good investigations and research, being careless, and being commanding. Under the conditions of the new area, there have been various difficulties in carrying out this work, but this work must be carried out resolutely, systematically, and in a planned manner.

　　Rent Reduction and Rent Refund Are Carried Out Around Spring Ploughing and Overcoming Famine

　　(4) Since January, secret agents, bandits, and local bully landlords have carried out instigation and rumors in some places, conspired to sabotage, and carried out riots. There have been significant losses of warehouses and materials, and people and cadres have been killed. In Hubei Province, secret agents and bandits cooperated to shout that the burden was too heavy and to spread rumors that the land would be distributed immediately and that houses could be freely occupied. Reactionary landlords have resisted rent reduction on the pretext of food shortages, or taken the opportunity to sell grain, obtain large amounts of RMB for speculation, buy silver dollars, disrupt finance, or collude with secret agents and bandits to oppress farmers, shift the burden, and then instigate and threaten farmers to participate in their conspiracies and riots. In response to this situation, while carrying out bandit suppression and stabilizing prices, we launched the work of rent reduction and rent refund (refunding the rent that should have been reduced in the autumn) around the task of spring ploughing and overcoming the famine. In Hubei, an average of 200 dan of rent were refunded per Bao, and some landlords had to report hidden land and pay the public grain that should have been paid in the farmer's rent reduction movement. Five million mu of hidden land were found in Henan Province, and nearly five million mu in Hubei. Wherever rent reduction work has been carried out, the rumors have subsided, the riots have disappeared, the farmers have automatically organized warehouse protection, and the enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Now that the production season has arrived, all provinces have been ordered to fully shift their work tasks to spring ploughing and production, solve the difficulties of farmers lacking food and seeds, and carry out the production movement. Although this movement cannot be carried out in the same way as in the old areas, this work must be carried out conscientiously according to the local situation. Some shortcomings and mistakes have also occurred in the rent reduction work, and all localities have been ordered to pay attention to correcting them, and to correct them if they are wrong.

　　(5) Disaster relief work: There are approximately 10 million disaster victims in various places, of which approximately 4.5 million are severely affected, in 171 counties and the two cities of Nanchang and Jiujiang, of which 51 counties and 1 city are severely affected. Due to seasonal natural relations, the number of disaster victims in some places has increased somewhat. Before I left for Beijing, the disaster relief committee of the Military and Political Committee had just held a meeting, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs had also specifically discussed the issue of disaster relief. In addition to rent reduction, which can solve a considerable part of the problem, various grain loans (including work-for-food and organizing sideline businesses, etc.) amount to a total of 286.65 million jin in the entire region, and seed loans, according to incomplete statistics, have reached 66.39 million jin. The 100 million jin approved by the central government is planned to be used with emphasis, and most of it is planned to be reserved for use during the summer famine, which is estimated to be able to roughly overcome the spring famine. However, the disaster situation must be given great attention, and the Military and Political Committee and the provinces are sending personnel to inspect one after another.

　　The above are some of the main situations of the work in the Central South region in the recent period. As for the implementation (Henan) and preparation work for land distribution, culture and education, and other work, the Military and Political Committee has made more detailed discussions. Land reform is of concern to the broad masses of farmers and democratic people from all walks of life, and requires full preparation work, including investigating the situation, preparing methods, rectifying and training a large number of cadres, convening people's and farmers' representative conferences from all walks of life, organizing the farmer masses, conducting widespread land reform propaganda and education, selecting areas, and determining implementation steps, which are being carried out by people's governments at all levels and their land reform committees, farmers' associations, etc.

　　Other work situations will be reported later. Please give comments and corrections, Chairman and fellow members.

### 中南军政委员会主席  林彪关于中南工作情况的报告

　　中南军政委员会主席
    林彪关于中南工作情况的报告
    【新华社十二日讯】中南军政委员会主席林彪关于中南工作情况的报告（一九五○年四月十一日在中央人民政府第六次会议上），全文如下：主席、各位委员：
    关于中南区开辟经过、工作概况，邓子恢委员已在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上报告过了，我只将近几个月来几件主要事情报告一下：
    我军一部登海南岛作战  其余进行剿匪整训生产
    （一）中南区从去年十二月十二日我人民解放军占领镇南关，结束中南区域内最大、最艰苦的桂粤歼灭战以来，我军任务除继续准备与进行海南岛登陆作战外，已在按国防与治安需要重新布署，一部分进行剿匪，其他则进行整训和生产了。我军在桂粤大追歼作战中表现了高度英勇与艰苦卓绝的精神，许多部队一昼夜行军二百余里，连续行军多达二十五日者，终于赶上了逃窜十分迅速的敌匪军，达到了合围歼灭的目的。以顽强狡猾著称的白崇禧匪部除很小一部分逃出大陆国土外，已经被全部歼灭了。战役结束后部队未及休整，即转向新的任务。现在我军已有一部在海南岛登陆，并在继续准备海南岛的作战。剿匪，连前一时期各地剿匪在内，共计已歼灭三十九万余人，尚有少数残余土匪，亟待肃清。我军由于毛主席的英明领导与高度关怀，由于中央人民政府成立，由于全国胜利与人民热烈协助，士气甚为振奋。最近毛主席带回的中苏友好条约，又大大鼓舞了我军战士与中南区广大人民。部队生产问题，已遵照毛主席指示，除担任海南岛作战的部队免除生产任务外，其他均按任务情况及所在地的客观情况，规定分为五种不同标准缴纳交公任务，最高标准为每人平均五百斤大米，至低者为三十斤大米。此外正在直接组织襄河上游和黄泛区所属颍水两大水利工程之修建，多余的运输工具则组织运输生产，协助政府运输公粮出口，并拟以可能的劳力承修一两条公路和若干铁道支线。担任剿匪的部队，均计划限期完成清除土匪的任务。所有部队，并均按照当地可能与必要的情况，兼起工作队的任务，协助地方政府，地方干部，进行发动群众，逐步进行社会改革的工作。
    各县市大多开过代表会  有益人民民主专政制度
    （二）二月间举行中南军政委员会第一次会议，通过了中南区一九五○年工作任务和军政委员会组织条例，修正通过了减租减息等条例，配备了军政委员会及其各部重要人员名单和各省人民政府委员会名单，均已送呈中央人民政府审核公布。
    各县市大多已经开过各界人民代表会议。河南，江西，已经全部开过一次。湖北三十六县，湖南二十八县，亦已开过。有的已经开过两次，城市中有开过十二次者。中南六省，除尚为土匪扰乱暂时尚难开会的一小部分县份外，均拟于今年上半年一律再开一次人民代表会议。河南省正在召开全省人民代表会议，选举省人民政府。鄂、赣、湘、粤等省及武汉、广州两市的人民代表会议亦在筹备召开。区乡农民代表会议几已普遍召开。有的乡已达十多次。据豫、鄂、湘、赣四省不完全材料，参加区乡农民代表会议的代表人数约达五十万人（以参加一次为一人计）。省农民代表会议湖北已开过，河南正在开，江西及其他各省也在准备召开。城市的工人、妇女、青年，有的已开过，或正拟召开代表会议。经验证明：用系统地召开各界人民代表会议的方法，联系广大人民群众，实施人民民主制度，举凡政府各项重要措施及当地人民普遍与迫切的要求，例如剿匪、反恶霸、减租减息、分配土地、征粮收税、生产救灾等，均经过代表会议讨论通过，协助政府执行政策法令，比之不开这些会议或只开干部会议，要好得多。进一步经过各界人民代表会议选举地方人民政府，团结各阶层人民及其代表人物，将对我人民民主专政制度有极大的裨益。惟我各级政府工作人员尚有许多人不很熟悉这种方式，有些会议开得不很好，有的犯了形式主义的毛病。中南军政委员会将就实施经验，不断给以总结指正，帮助各级政府、人民团体，逐步开好这些会议。
    公粮大部完成  税收超过任务
    （三）征收公粮任务，鄂、豫、湘、赣各省已经全部完成，两广完成百分之五十以上。税收已经完成了一九四九年及今年一二两月份任务，并稍有超过。公债已实销二千万分，占原定三千万分任务百分之六十六强。由于征收任务的完成，公债及其他必要措施，已经初步达到配合全国、平衡收支、稳定物价的目的。惟在具体工作中仍犯了若干错误，如在征粮中由于新区初开辟，干部很少，情况了解不够，发生过畸轻畸重的现象。由于保甲的关系，许多地方农民负担过重，有些地方又对某些个别地主或其他人士征收过多，地区上也有畸轻畸重现象。税收中也有个别类似情形。我们对于这些情况非常重视，原中原临时人民政府已就征粮情形出过布告。军政委员会开会时，亦曾就当时情况作了报告、分析和讨论。最近召开的财经会议，按照政务院财政经济委员会指示，就全区情况作了检查、讨论，并拟定了一九五○年征收、编制等计划。干部当中，特别是旧人员当中，曾发生了若干不良现象，我们正拟整顿干部，克服贪污浪费及不很好调查研究粗枝大叶和命令主义的作风。在新区条件下，进行这些工作，曾有种种困难，但必须坚决地系统地有计划地来进行这个工作。
    围绕春耕渡荒进行减租退租
    （四）从一月份以来，特务、土匪及恶霸地主，曾在一些地方进行挑拨造谣，阴谋破坏，并举行暴乱的行动。仓库和物资的损失不少，人民和干部亦有受杀害的。在湖北省曾有特务土匪配合叫喊负担过重、造谣言说马上要分田地可自由侵占房子的事发生。反动地主曾借口缺粮，抵抗减租，或者趁机出卖粮食，拿到大批人民币进行投机倒把，收买现洋，捣乱金融，或者勾结特务土匪压逼农民，转嫁负担，又从而煽动和威胁农民，参加他们的阴谋暴乱，针对这种情况，我们在进行剿匪、稳定物价的同时，即发动围绕春耕渡荒任务，进行减租退租（退去秋应减之租）工作。湖北平均每保退租二百担，有的地主在农民减租运动中不得不报出黑地，交纳应缴公粮。河南全省查出黑地五百万亩，湖北也近五百万亩。凡在减租工作开展的地方，谣言即平息了，暴乱也没有了，农民自动组织护仓，生产情绪也大为提高。现在生产季节已到，已令各省将工作任务全力转在春耕生产上去，解决农民缺粮缺种等困难，开展生产运动。虽然这个运动还不可能像老区一样进行，但是必须依当地情况认真进行这个工作。在减租工作中也发生了一些缺点及错误，已令各地注意纠正，错了的把它改正过来。
    （五）救灾工作：各地灾民约有一千余万人，其中重灾约四百五十万人，地区达一百七十一县及南昌九江两市，其中重者五十一县及一市。因为季节自然关系，某些地方灾民有些增多。在我动身来京之前，军政委员会的救灾委员会刚开过一次会议，民政部也专门讨论了救灾问题。除去减租可以解决相当大的一部分问题之外，各种贷粮（包括以工代赈、组织副业等）全区共达二亿八千六百五十万斤，贷种据不完全统计已达六千六百三十九万斤。中央批准之一亿斤，准备有重点的使用，并准备大部留作夏荒时动用，估计尚可大体渡过春荒。但灾情必须十分重视，军政委员会及各省正在先后派员视察。
    以上这些，是最近时期中南区工作的几个主要情况。至于分配土地的实行（河南）与准备工作，文化教育及其他工作，军政委员会均作了较详尽的讨论。土地改革为广大农民及各界民主人士所关怀，需要充分的准备工作，包括调查情况，准备办法，整顿并训练大批干部，开各界人民及农民代表会议，组织农民群众，普遍进行土改的宣传教育工作，地区的选定及决定施行步骤等项，均由各级人民政府及其土改委员会、农民协会等在进行中。
    其他工作情况以后另作报告。请主席、各位委员加以指正。
