　　A Certain Division of the People's Liberation Army Stationed in North China
    Enters Production Position
    to Manage Changtai Farm with Seven Thousand Mu
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: A certain division of the People's Liberation Army stationed in North China has been approved by relevant higher authorities to use the Changtai Farm, covering an area of seven thousand mu, near the Bohai Bay. On March 17th, the division held a solemn swearing-in ceremony and formally entered the production position. The general commanders and fighters are in high spirits for production. After the canal digging project started, water seeped out as they dug. Zhao Ziyi, a fighter from the machine gun and artillery company of the 588th Regiment, took the lead, and many people, disregarding the thin ice on the water, took off their shoes and socks and jumped into the water to continue digging. After the leading comrades, in order to take care of their health, issued a call to complete the task without going into the water, three new canal digging methods (such as the segmented staggered digging method: digging deep into one section, and digging another section after the water flows down; the step digging method; first digging deep in the middle to store water, and then digging down from both sides step by step; the method of digging a reservoir at one end of the canal, etc.) that constantly adapt to the seepage of water were immediately created by the masses. A class in the 586th Regiment completed the project scheduled for five days in twenty-four hours; the entire battalion of the Third Battalion of the 586th Regiment also completed the five-day project in four and a half days.
    While producing, they also study culture. The political department of the division has universally opened "Literacy Sundry Shops" in the production position. During rest, the fighters go to the literacy shop to receive the new characters they should recognize today and stick them on shovels or baskets. Some can learn five characters a day.
    Eighty percent of the soldiers in this division are liberated soldiers, many of whom have been out of production for a long time or completely lack production skills and labor training. The reason why they are now able to show such positive labor achievements is due to active education, mobilization, and correct organization and leadership. The division had conducted twenty days of production education in particular, and appropriately adjusted and strengthened the organizational leadership, especially strengthening the organizational leadership of the Party branches and groups in production work. In addition, cultural and recreational activities on the production position have been strengthened, which have played a great role in encouraging labor enthusiasm.

　　驻华北人民解放军
    某师进入生产阵地
    经营七千亩的长泰农场
    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：驻在华北的人民解放军某师，已经有关上级批准使用临近渤海湾面积七千亩的长泰农场。三月十七日该师举行了庄严隆重的宣誓仪式，正式进入生产阵地。一般指战员，生产情绪很高。挖渠工程开始后，一边挖，一边就渗出水来，该师五八八团机炮连战士赵子仪领头，很多人竟不顾水上结着薄冰，脱下鞋袜跳在水里继续挖掘。领导同志为了照顾健康，提出不下水完成任务的号召后，三种适应不断渗水这一情况的新的挖渠方法（如分段交五挖法：挖深一段，水流下了再挖另一段；阶梯挖法；先将当中挖深，以便贮水，然后从两侧逐级下挖；于渠之一端先掘贮水池的挖法等），立刻被群众创造出来。五八六团一个班，在二十四小时内完成了预定五日的工程；五八六团三营全营五天的工程，也在四天半完成。
    一面生产，一面学习文化。该师政治处在生产阵地里普遍开设了“生字杂货铺”，休息的时候，战士们到生字铺里领到今天应认的生字，贴在铁锹或箩筐上，有的一天能学五个字。
    这个师有百分之八十的解放战士，其中很多的人已经长期脱离生产或根本缺乏生产智能和劳动锻炼。现在所以能够表现这样积极劳动的成绩，是由于积极教育、动员和正确的组织领导的结果。该师曾特别进行了二十天的生产教育，并适当地调整与加强了组织领导力量，特别是加强了党的支部与小组在生产工作中的组织领导。此外并加强了生产阵地上的文化娱乐活动，使文娱工作在鼓励劳动情绪上起了很大的作用。
