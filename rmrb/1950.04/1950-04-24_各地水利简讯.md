Local Water Conservancy Briefs

    The Ji River flows through Gaoyi County in the Shijiazhuang Special District. Every year, the fourteen villages including Northeast Ying in the county suffer from flooding of more than 3,000 mu of land. After preparation and mobilization throughout the county last winter and this spring, the county mobilized more than 12,000 laborers from 99 villages in four districts. Work began on March 14th and was completed in three days by March 16th. A total of 31,330 laborers were used (saving 20,000 workdays compared to the original plan) to complete the entire project of digging the river and building dikes for 18 *li* and 140,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The completion of this project will prevent 3,000 *mu* of fertile land in 14 villages of the county from being flooded. Calculating an increase of 3 to 5 *shi dou* per *mu*, a total of 1,050 *shi* of grain can be increased.

    The Shijiazhuang Special District in Hebei Province has more than 300 canals of various sizes. The longer canals, such as Jin Gao, Ling Zheng, and Yuanquan, total 417 *li* in length, benefiting 152 villages along the canals and irrigating more than 174,600 *mu* of land. Fourteen counties and one town in the entire special district, including Zhengding, Pingshan, and Jianping, are irrigated by canal water every year, avoiding spring droughts. At the same time, the average yield of crops irrigated by canals is twice that of dry land.

　　各地水利简讯
    济河流经石家庄专区高邑县，该县东北营等十四个村，每年要淹地三千余亩。该县经去冬今春的酝酿准备，动员了全县四个区九十九个村一万二千余民工，自三月十四日动工，至十六日，三天内共用民工三万一千三百三十个（较原计划节省二万工）完成十八华里、十四万公方土挖河筑堤的全部工程。该工程的完成，可使该县十四个村三千余亩良田不遭水淹，以每亩增产三、五市斗计，共可增产粮食一千零五十市石。
