The case of Liu Guoyi, a member of the Hejian County Public Security Bureau in Hebei Province and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, using violence to force a marriage, which was published in this newspaper on April 4th, has aroused strong reactions from readers.

A student from the China People's University, Yu Chen, wrote: "Liu Guoyi's criminal behavior not only lost the basic conditions of a Communist Party member, but also the basic conditions of an ordinary staff member of the People's Government. Is it not enough to give him the punishment of 'probation within the Party'?" Ren Li of the Ministry of Railways wrote: "Liu Guoyi violated Chairman Mao's repeated instructions and actually acted recklessly above the people. Does he still have even a trace of the flavor of a Communist Party member?" Zhang Nianhua, a citizen of the Tenth District of Beijing, wrote: "Liu Guoyi has forgotten the fine tradition of Communist Party members serving the people wholeheartedly and undermined the laws and decrees of the People's Government. He should be severely punished." Guan Wen from the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau wrote: "As a Communist Party member, I propose severely punishing Liu Guoyi. His behavior is simply bullying!" Dong Bian, a resident of No. 25 Shijia Hutong in this city, wrote: "In addition to Liu Guoyi receiving the legal sanctions he deserves, the three village cadres who were accomplices should also be punished. Those who implement policies violate policies, which is knowing the law and breaking the law." Yin Rui, a resident of No. 10 Dongguanyinsi, wrote: "Liu Guoyi is a member of the Public Security Bureau of Hejian County. Does he have a section chief above him? Does he have a division chief? Does he have a bureau chief? For such a long time, with such a big mistake, don't these superiors know anything at all? It should be strictly investigated!" ...This is the readers' public opinion sanctioning Liu Guoyi!

We agree with the readers' opinions and demands, and we agree with the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission's recommendation to expel Liu Guoyi from the Party. Our Party's discipline does not allow such elements to remain in the Party, and our People's Government's laws will not condone such civil servants.

The occurrence of this incident should arouse the vigilance of other Party members and civil servants. Studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Mao Zedong Thought, and studying the policies of the Party and the People's Government must not remain on the lips or on paper, but must be put into practice and implemented in daily life and practical work. We should constantly examine our own revolutionary qualities, examine our own ideological style, and examine our relationship with the masses. Furthermore, the Party and government leading organs in Hejian County should use this case as practical educational material, conduct profound self-criticism, and conduct extensive ideological education for cadres. Comrade Liu Shaoqi taught us: "Our Party members should not only temper themselves and strengthen their self-cultivation in arduous, difficult, and even failed revolutionary practices, but also temper themselves and strengthen their self-cultivation in smooth, successful, and victorious revolutionary practices." (See the introduction to "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists") This should always be the direction of our efforts.

### 刘国义案件的反响

　　刘国义案件的反响
    四月四日本刊发表了河北省河间县公安局股员中共党员刘国义暴力逼婚的案件，引起了读者们的强烈反响。
    中国人民大学学生雨辰君来信说：“刘国义的犯罪行为，不但失去了共产党员的起码条件，而且失去了人民政府普通工作人员的起码条件，给以‘留党察看’的处分是不够？”铁道部任理君来信说：“刘国义违反毛主席的一再指示，居然站在人民头上胡作胡为，难道还有一丝一毫共产党员的气味吗？”北京市第十区市民张念华君来信说：“刘国义忘记了共产党员全心全意为人民服务的优良传统，破坏人民政府的法令，应该严加惩罚。”天津铁路局北京分局关文同志来信说：“我以共产党员的身份，提议重惩刘国义，他的行为简直是恶霸行为！”本市史家胡同二十五号居民董边君来信说：“除刘国义应受应得的法律制裁外，三个帮凶的村干部也应受处分，执行政策者破坏政策，就是知法犯法。”东观音寺十号居民殷锐君来信说：“刘国义是河间县公安股员，他上边还有股长吗？有科长吗？有局长吗？这样长的时间，这样大的错误，难道这些上级一点都不知道吗？应该严查！”……。这就是读者舆论对刘国义的制裁！
    我们赞同读者们的意见和要求，赞同河北省委纪律委员会开除刘国义的建议。我们党的纪律不容许这种份子留在党内，我们人民政府的法律也不会放纵这样的公务员。
    这一事件的发生应该引起其他党员和公务员的警惕。学习马列主义，学习毛泽东思想，学习党和人民政府的政策，决不能停留在口头上，也不能停留在纸面上，一定要身体力行，在日常生活和实际工作中贯彻下去。应该时刻检查自己的革命品质，检查自己的思想作风，检查自己与群众的关系。而河间县党政领导机关更要把这个案件作为实际的教育材料，进行深刻的自我检讨，进行广泛的干部思想教育。刘少奇同志教导我们：“我们的党员不独要在艰苦的、困难的以至失败的革命实践中锻炼自己，加紧自己的修养，而且要在顺利的、成功的、胜利的革命实践中锻炼自己，加紧自己的修养。”（见“论共产党员的修养”绪论）这应该永远是我们努力的方向。
