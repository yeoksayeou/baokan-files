Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The large-scale offensive launched by the Philippine People's Liberation Army in central and southern Luzon has been continuously expanding over the past week. According to a United Press report from Manila on the 3rd: the offensive of the Philippine People's Liberation Army has expanded from provinces such as Laguna, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Batangas to Bataan, Zambales, and Nueva Ecija in western Luzon. The Liberation Army occupied the city of Bagac in Bataan province. Boko and Cabangan in Zambales province were attacked by the Liberation Army, and the governor of the province has anxiously begged the Quirino government for reinforcements. The Liberation Army also launched attacks on the cities of Tayug, Balungao, and Umingan in Nueva Ecija province. In addition, the Liberation Army also launched offensives in Quezon, Cavite, Tarlac, and Bulacan provinces. United Press stated: "There are many reasons to believe that the Philippine government has suffered 'truly heavy losses' in the fighting since March 28." The *Manila Bulletin* reported in a panic on the 4th that the Liberation Army had briefly infiltrated the urban area of Baguio, where Quirino is currently "residing," on the 3rd, while the mountains near Baguio had already been occupied by the Liberation Army.

The offensive of the Philippine Liberation Army has alarmed the Philippine reactionaries and their American masters. According to an Agence France-Presse report, after a high-level meeting in Baguio on the 1st, attended by Anderson, the head of the U.S. "Military Advisory Group," Quirino ordered the entire island of Luzon to be placed under military control, and authorized the newly appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Castañeda, to command military and police operations in a unified manner. Another United Press report from Manila on the 3rd stated: "Americans and other foreigners in the Philippines today have an uneasy feeling of sitting on a powder keg." The U.S. Embassy has hastily deployed U.S. Marines to Manila to serve as embassy guards.

　　菲解放军攻势扩及十余省
    攻占巴加克渗入碧瑶     
    马尼拉美使馆急忙调兵警戒
    【新华社五日讯】菲律宾人民解放军在吕宋中部、南部所发动的大规模攻势，一周以来正不断扩大中。据合众社马尼拉三日电：菲人民解放军的攻势已自拉古纳、班邦加、鲁瓦·伊西加和八打雁等省，扩大到西吕宋的巴丹、占巴利斯和邦加新南诸省。解放军曾攻占巴丹省的巴加克城。占巴利斯省波考和卡班干两地曾遭解放军进攻，该省总督已惊恐地向季里诺政府乞求援军。解放军并进攻邦加新南省的塔幼格、巴尨高和幽明岗三城。此外，解放军也在奎松、卡菲特、塔拉克、虎拉卡等省发动了攻势。合众社称：有许多理由使人相信自三月二十八日以来的战事中，菲政府“损失确实很重”。《马尼拉公报》四日恐慌地报道，解放军三日曾一度渗入季里诺现在“驻节”所在地的碧瑶市区，而碧瑶附近山地则早已有解放军出现。
    菲解放军的攻势，使菲律宾反动派及其美国主子惊惶万状。据法新社讯，季里诺一日在碧瑶举行了有美国“军事顾问团”团长安德逊参加的高级人员会议后，下令将吕宋全岛置于军事管制之下，并授权新任武装部队总司令卡斯塔尼达统一指挥军警作战。另据合众社马尼拉三日电称：“菲律宾的美国人和其他外国人今天都有一种好似坐在火药库上的不安的感觉”。美国大使馆已急调美国海军陆战队至马尼拉，担任大使馆的警戒。
