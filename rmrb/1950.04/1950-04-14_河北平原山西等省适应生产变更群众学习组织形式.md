Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi and other provinces, in concluding the winter literacy campaign, many regions attached importance to piloting farmers' regular literacy education with focus, and planned and led the transfer of some better-conditioned winter schools into regular people's schools, paying attention to combining learning with production, and solving problems such as people's school teachers. However, some regions still do not pay enough attention to this work, or are too hasty, which must be corrected in time.

The Handan Special District of Hebei Province has already transferred more than 500 winter schools to people's schools based on the conditions of better management, learning achievements, and mass demand for learning; the Special Commissioner's Office also decided to combine spring plowing and construction work to build 1,452 winter schools with the same conditions into people's schools. In Shen County, Pingyuan Province, more than 70 people's schools have officially started classes. Most people's schools also use mobile blackboard newspapers, word delivery, and other methods to conduct spring plowing production education in conjunction with cultural learning. The Ping Shun County Government of Shanxi Province dispatched cadres to specifically inspect the winter school situation, and then decided to transform the county's 368 winter schools into regular people's schools, general people's schools or village clubs according to specific conditions; the 73 winter schools that were determined to be transformed into regular people's schools formulated specific teaching plans and systems, requiring students to attend classes regularly up to 80 percent.

In the process of transitioning from winter schools to people's schools, various localities generally first used a serious summary of winter school achievements to inspire the masses' enthusiasm for conscious long-term learning. Ping Shun, Yu She, Ling Chuan and other counties in Shanxi Province universally carried out mass movements to summarize winter schools and award models; the masses saw concrete achievements from the summary and testing process, and their enthusiasm for learning was encouraged. The leadership then seized the opportunity to conduct in-depth ideological education to guide them to transfer to regular people's schools. Some winter schools in Ling Chuan wanted to disband after the Spring Festival. After summarizing, rewarding, and publicizing the benefits of long-term learning, they overcame the erroneous idea among the masses that "winter school ends, learning also ends," and established the idea of long-term learning. In the summary, Ping Shun County awarded 55 model teachers and more than 1,000 model students by the masses, and used them as the backbone to lead the masses, creating conditions for the masses to consciously enroll in schools. Second, all localities paid attention to appropriately changing the original organizational forms and learning methods of winter schools according to local production conditions, closely combining with production. The learning organizations of people's schools in various localities have been transformed into groups based on production teams, or voluntarily grouped according to students' residences and the distance of the land. The Ling Chuan People's School in Shanxi adopted the method of self-study in groups, with the group leader or group members with higher cultural levels leading the study during production gaps, and teachers cooperating to teach while moving around in the meal yards and rest places, which was very effective. In terms of learning time, all localities generally flexibly use rest time such as after lunch, at night, and during meals to solve the difficulty of conflicting with production time. For example, the people's schools in Da Ming and She County, Hebei Province, generally adopted the method of self-study in groups, combined with classes three or five days a week, each time not exceeding one hour, and stipulated a leave system, dispelling the masses' concerns about entering people's schools being "not free" and "delaying work," and actively joining people's schools. Third, attention was paid to solving the difficulty of people's school teachers. Due to funding constraints, people's schools in various localities could not hire full-time teachers, but volunteer teachers could not delay production for a long time. In solving this difficulty, in addition to giving appropriate subsidies or in-kind rewards to teachers who are enthusiastic about teaching and have real family difficulties, some are voluntarily formulated by the masses to exchange work with teachers to solve teachers' production difficulties. In addition, in some areas of Shanxi and Pingyuan, it is stipulated that political and current affairs classes in people's schools are concurrently held by district and village cadres, while cultural education mobilizes intellectuals, high school students, or students with higher levels in the township to serve as teachers, adopting the method of learning and teaching at the same time, and implementing the principle of "people teach the people," which also overcomes the difficulty of lacking teachers.

At present, some leading cadres in some regions still neglect and relax the leadership of the winter school to people's school work; others have excessively high requirements for the number of people's schools to be transferred without considering specific conditions. For example, the Yu Ci Special Commissioner's Office in Shanxi Province requires that more than 80 percent of winter schools in old liberated areas be transferred to people's schools, requiring every village to have youth supplementary classes and all young people to enter schools. These two tendencies of letting things go or forcing enrollment have aroused the attention of leading cadres in various localities.

　　河北平原山西等省适应生产变更群众学习组织形式
    河北、平原、山西等省在结束冬学工作中，许多地区重视了有重点地试办农民常年识字教育的工作，有计划、有领导地把一部分条件较好的冬学转入了常年民校，并注意结合生产进行学习，解决了民校师资等问题。但部分地区对此一工作仍不重视，或操之过急，须及时纠正。
    河北省邯郸专区已根据办理较好、学习有成绩、群众有学习要求的条件，将五百余处冬学首先转为民校；专署并决定结合春耕和建政工作，再将具备同样条件的冬学转建民校到一千四百五十二座。平原省莘县已有七十余处民校正式开课，大部民校并利用游动黑板报、送字等方法，结合文化学习进行春耕生产教育。山西平顺县县政府曾抽派干部专门检查了冬学状况，然后根据具体条件决定将全县三百六十八处冬学分别转为常年民校、一般民校或村俱乐部；确定转为常年民校的七十三个冬学，则订立具体的教学计划和制度，要求学员经常到课的达到百分之八十。
    在由冬学转为民校过程中，各地一般首先以认真总结冬学成绩来启发群众自觉的长年学习的热情。山西平顺、榆社、陵川等县普遍进行了群众性的总结冬学、评奖模范运动；从总结、测验过程中使群众看到具体成绩，鼓舞了学习热情，领导上即抓紧进行深入的思想教育，引导其转入长年民校。陵川有些冬学，在春节以后就想散学，经过总结、奖励和宣传常年学习的好处后，克服了群众中的“冬学结束，学习也结束”的错误观念，树立起长期学习的思想。平顺县在总结中，由群众评奖了五十五个模范教员和一千余名模范学员，并以他们作骨干带领群众，造成了群众性的自觉入校的条件。第二，各地均注意根据当地生产情况，适当改变了原来冬学的组织形式和学习方法，密切结合生产。各地民校学习组织均转变为以生产小组为基础，或依学员居住、土地远近等情况自愿结组。山西陵川民校采取以小组为单位进行自学，以组长或文化较高的组员领导在生产间隙学习，教员配合在饭场和休息地点游动讲授，收效很大。在学习时间上，各地一般灵活运用午饭后、晚上、吃饭时等休息时间，以解决与生产时间矛盾的困难。如河北大名、涉县民校普遍采取以小组自学为主，结合三、五天上课一次，每次不超过一小时的方法，并规定了请假制度，解除了群众怕入民校“不自由”、“耽误活”的顾虑，踊跃加入民校。第三，注意解决了民校师资困难。各地民校因受经费的限制，不能聘请专职教员，但义务教员又不能长期耽误生产。各地在解决这个困难中，除对教学热情、家庭确实困难的教员，由政府予以适当补助或实物奖励外，有些则系群众自愿订出与教员换工的办法，解决教员生产困难。此外，山西、平原有些地区规定民校政治课、时事课由区、村干部兼任，文化教育则动员在乡知识分子、高小学生或程度较高的学员担任，采取边学边教，贯彻“民教民”的方针，也克服了缺乏教员的困难。
    目前，仍有一部分地区的领导干部忽视和放松冬学转民校工作的领导；也有的不根据具体条件，过高地要求转民校的数字。如山西榆次专署要求老区冬学百分之八十以上一律转为民校，要求村村有青补班、全体青年入校。这种放任自流，或强迫入校的两种偏向，已引起各地领导干部的重视。
