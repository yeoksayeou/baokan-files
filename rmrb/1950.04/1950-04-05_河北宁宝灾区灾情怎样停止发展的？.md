　　How was the Disaster Development Halted in the Ningbao Disaster Area of Hebei?

The disaster in Hebei Province was most severe in the combined area of Ninghe, Baodi, Ji (county), and Yutian (county) counties. Coupled with the poor disaster relief work in the initial stages, the disaster situation worsened. At the end of last year, the people in the disaster area were in extreme distress. 80% of the people mainly survived on bran and vegetable gruel, and a large number of disaster victims were forced to flee. The Central People's Government cared for the people in the area and allocated a large amount of emergency relief and production loans to support the area's production. Party and government organs at all levels in Hebei Province also organized a large number of personnel to invest in the disaster area. After two months of self-salvation through production, the people in the area have successfully survived the winter famine, and their lives have begun to improve, creating favorable conditions for completely overcoming the disaster. The experience of the Ningbao Disaster Area Working Committee in leading self-salvation through production is reported as follows:

When the flood came, the measures taken by most villages in the area were: widely publicizing the policy of self-salvation through production, strengthening the confidence to overcome the disaster, and mobilizing the masses to elect people with production experience in various industries and those who suffered the most and were enthusiastic about production to establish village production representative meetings or production committees as the command center for production and disaster relief. At the same time, strengthen the leadership of the Party and mobilize Party members and League members to actively unite with activists to jointly lead the entire village in production.

The establishment of this production committee has three advantages: First, people with production methods in various industries are absorbed into the leading organs, and the masses trust them more. For example, it is easier for a fishing expert to mobilize disaster victims to participate in fishing than for ordinary people, and it is easier to establish the masses' confidence in production; second, it enriches the village-level leadership and makes it easier to overcome difficulties in production; third, village representatives themselves have technology and production methods, which is the condition to realize leading production with production.

When these outstanding production elements were elected as production leaders, they were in high spirits. Wang "Bo Tou," who had more than ten years of fishing experience in Yuan Changzi, District 9 of Baodi, was elected as the director of the production representative meeting. He excitedly said: "I am very happy to lead the fishing." He actively prepared the tools and materials needed and tried to overcome difficulties. Sun Zhuangzi, District 2 of Ninghe, originally had a poor production foundation, but the village established a production representative meeting. The representatives included Tang Zhi, an expert in weaving mats, Zhao Haoran, who could fish, and Xu Youzhang, who had experience in transportation. Through the active activities and leadership of these representatives, the number of households weaving mats in the village quickly increased from one to nine, the number of fishing households increased to eleven, and the number of transportation households expanded to thirty. Out of the 63 households in the village, 50 were engaged in production.

            Different Organizational Methods for Different Production Conditions

At the beginning of organizing production, the masses lacked confidence in self-salvation through production and had a mentality of simply relying on relief. After issuing loans, emphasizing support for production, and correcting the average distribution and initially organizing production, some people developed the tendency of "swallowing a whole loaf at once" and looking down on small-scale production with small profits. The leadership emphasized starting from small things and developing a variety of sideline production. However, in some villages with truly good production conditions and a production foundation, the focus was on first supporting large-scale production that was related to the majority of the masses, and driving small-scale production. For example, in Hulugu, District 9 of Ningbao, there were a total of 55 households in the village. The focus was on supporting ten boats, and 51 households participated in fishing, which drove 52 households of women to weave nets. Each boat could supply the activities of four or five fishmongers. Since the beginning of spring, the village has been able to produce 4,000 catties of fish per day, and sell fish to purchase 30 shi of red sorghum. Women weave and sell nets, earning a total of 20 shi of rice. The whole village has been guaranteed to survive the spring famine.

According to the changes in production seasons and production conditions, the masses were actively and plannedly organized to change occupations. When winter came and the water level dropped and there were fewer fish in Renqianhu Village, Ninghe, the production committee planned to mobilize the masses to switch to weaving straw bags. However, no one in the village knew how to weave, so people were sent to other villages to learn. In the first stage of production, money was lost due to low technology. Village cadres and representatives personally learned the technology (increasing from two to six bags per day). They took apprentices, and within a month, more than 70 straw bag machines were developed in the village, greatly improving the lives of the villagers. For example, Ren Lianfang's group, with a total of three households and 18 people, could not even eat enough bran and vegetables before weaving straw bags; one month after weaving straw bags, the three families, young and old, ate half grain and half bran, and also purchased wheat seeds in preparation for agricultural production.

            Strengthen the Leadership of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Production

In the area's leadership of self-salvation through production, there was also a more important defect, that is, the Working Committee of the area, the Party and government leading organs of Ninghe County, did not fully use the favorable conditions of convenient transportation and urban-rural exchanges to plan to develop various mass handicrafts and sideline production in the disaster area. The leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives was insufficient. As a result, the supply and marketing cooperatives could not keep up with the needs of various production developments in the disaster relief work.

For example, Ninghe County is located between Tianjin and Tangshan, with the Beijing-Shenyang Railway running through it for more than 100 miles, and the Jiyun River running through the north and south. The transportation is very convenient. The county has six major mass sideline industries in more than 100 villages, including fishing, weaving mats, straw bags, firewood, transportation, and textiles. However, the county's supply and marketing cooperatives did not accurately grasp the production situation in the county, and did not provide assistance and organization for the large number of fishing industries. The special products of the Jiyun River in winter, such as silver fish and purple crabs, did not attract the attention of the supply and marketing cooperatives.

After the initial development of various productions, how to strengthen the business of the supply and marketing cooperatives and develop disaster area production in a planned and organized manner is an urgent problem to be solved in the Ninghe disaster area.

The Central People's Government allocated a large amount of disaster relief loans and emphasized the combination with organizing production in the distribution process, which was a phased start for the area's production and disaster relief work. Experience has proved that correctly giving play to the role of disaster relief loans is an important key to organizing disaster victims to save themselves through production.

            Accurately Grasping the Disaster Situation and Stipulating the Loan Targets

Before the issuance of loans began, the Disaster Area Working Committee organized cadre forces to conduct in-depth investigations of seven different types of disaster-stricken villages and accurately study the disaster situation. At that time, the basic situation in the Ningbao severely affected areas was: 15% of the disaster victims were mostly orphaned and widowed households with no labor force, who had no means of living and urgently needed relief; 65% to 70% were living in difficulties and surviving on bran and vegetables, and only with material assistance could they carry out production; about 20% were not in great difficulty. In response to the above situation, the Disaster Area Working Committee clearly stipulated that the targets for the issuance of relief grain were orphaned and widowed households with no labor force and no means of living, and the scope of issuance should not exceed 15% of the total number of households; the targets for the issuance of various production loans were households with labor force who had difficulties in production, and the number of households issued was estimated to be about 65% of the total number of households in the village. This was an important preparatory work, so that grassroots cadres could have a clear idea when issuing loans. For example, when Han Tianshun Wang, Ninghe District 1, issued relief grain, the village cadres' representative meeting evaluated that there should be 42 households receiving relief, accounting for more than 31% of the total number of households in the village, which aroused Han Tianshun's suspicion. An in-depth investigation revealed that the representatives were afraid of offending people. In addition, as long as they were orphaned and widowed households, regardless of the size of the difficulty, they thought that they should be distributed evenly. Finally, the village cadres were persuaded with concrete materials, and only 20 households remained in the second serious evaluation.

            Starting from Organizing Production, Loans are Closely Linked to Production

In the process of issuing loans, many outstanding cadres created valuable experience in closely combining the issuance of loans with organizing production. Pi Shouyu, in Yian Village, Ninghe, closely combined the issuance of loans with the organization of production. He first learned that there were 20 boats parked in the village, which could be launched after repairs; most of the 84 households in the village could weave nets; two households selling tile pots had stopped; 11 transportation vehicles, 6 vehicles lacked capital and did not operate, etc. He immediately convened a meeting of boat owners to encourage the enthusiasm for resuming production, and further specifically helped the boat owners calculate: how much personal funds can be raised to repair the boats, and the government will provide assistance to the difficulties that cannot be solved. Then the village representative meeting evaluated. As a result, the village totaled 7,000 catties of various production loans, and only one household ate 50 catties, and 99.7% was invested in production. With the support of the loans, 20 boats, 59 households weaving nets, 11 transportation vehicles, and 2 households selling pots all operated. The masses in Yian Village reflected that production is like flour, and the government's loan is "leavening agent". When the "leavening agent" is added, the flour will "rise".

            Deviations in the Issuance of Loans Due to Unclear Thinking in Leading Production.

The process of issuing loans is the process of organizing production. Because some cadres did not understand this policy, the following deviations occurred in the issuance of loans:

    First, they did not understand the disaster victims' situation, and distributed "grain" evenly regardless of the size of the difficulty. For example, in Zhanghuzhuang, District 8 of Baodi, 300 catties of wheat seeds were evenly distributed to 13 households, and the truly difficult households received very little grain, which could not solve the wheat seed difficulties.

    Second, the issuance of loans was separated from the organization of production, and loans were not issued unless the disaster victims were organized. Huzhuangzi, District 1 of Ninghe, allocated 7,000 catties of various loans to the village, but only 2,000 catties were issued, because the district cadres did not specifically help the masses find production methods, and were afraid that the masses would eat the loans.

    Third, they did not seriously solve the specific difficulties in the disaster victims' production, so that the disaster victims urgently needed assistance, but a large amount of grain was accumulated and not issued. Within two months in District 1 of Ninghe, the total number of various production loans was 400,000 catties, and as of mid-March, 200,000 catties had not been issued to the disaster victims.

　　河北宁宝灾区灾情怎样停止发展的？
    本报记者  力文
    河北灾区以宁（河）宝（坻）蓟（县）玉（田）四县结合部受灾严重，加之初期救灾工作做得不好，更使灾情发展。去年年终，灾区人民陷于十分困苦，百分之八十的人民主要以糠菜糊口，大批灾民被迫逃荒。中央人民政府关怀该区人民，拨大批急赈及各项生产贷粮，扶助该区开展生产。河北省各级党政机关亦组织大批力量，投入灾区。经两个月生产自救运动的开展，该区人民已胜利渡过冬荒，生活开始改善，造成完全战胜灾荒的有力条件。兹将宁宝灾区工作委员会领导生产自救工作的经验，报道如下：
    水灾到来，该区多数村庄采取的办法是：广泛宣传生产自救方针，坚定战胜灾荒的信心，发动群众选举各行业中有生产经验的人和受灾最大热心生产的人，成立村生产代表会或生产委员会，作为生产救灾的指挥部。同时加强党的领导，发动党团员积极团结积极分子共同领导全村生产。
    这种生产委员会的建立，有三个好处：一、是各行各业生产有办法的人，被吸收到领导机关，群众对他们比较信任，如一个打鱼的行家，动员灾民参加治鱼，比一般人动员容易得多，且易树立群众的生产信心；二、丰富了村级领导，易于克服生产中的困难；三、村代表本身有技术，生产有办法，才有条件实现以生产领导生产。
    当这些生产优秀分子，被选为生产领导后，情绪很高。宝坻九区苑场子有十余年治鱼经验的王“箔头”，被选为生产代表会正主任，他兴奋的讲：“叫我领着下箔打鱼，我很高兴。”他就积极筹备所需用的工具、材料，并设法克服困难。宁河二区孙庄子本来生产基础较差，但该村成立了生产代表会，代表中有织席行家唐治、能治鱼的赵浩然、搞运输有经验的徐友章。经这些代表积极活动领导，该村由一户织席的很快发展到九户，治鱼的发展到十一户，搞运输的扩大到三十户，全村六十三户，就有五十户搞起生产。
            不同生产条件不同组织方法
    组织生产的开始，群众对生产自救缺乏信心，存有单纯依赖救济的心理。经过贷粮，强调扶助生产，纠正平均发放和初步组织起生产后，有的群众，又产生了“一口吞饱”，看不起利薄的小生产的偏向，领导上即强调从点滴入手，开展多种多样的副业生产。但在某些真真是生产条件好，有生产基础的村庄，则是有重点的首先扶植关系群众众多的大生产，带动小生产。如宁宝九区葫芦沽全村共五十五户，有重点的扶植了十只船，五十一户插伙治鱼，且带动了五十二户妇女织网，每个船可供给四五个鱼贩的活动。该村入春以来，每日可产鱼四千斤，卖鱼购进红粱三十石。妇女们织网卖网，共挣米二十石。全村渡过春荒，有了保证。
    根据生产季节与生产条件的变化，主动的有计划的组织群众转业。宁河任千户村在冬天到来，水落鱼少时，生产委员会便有计划的动员群众转业织草袋。但本村无人会织，派人到外村去学。第一段生产因技术低赔了钱，村干部、代表亲自学，掌握了技术（由一天织二个增至六个），他们带徒弟，一个月内，全村发展到七十多个草袋机，大大改善了村民的生活。如任连方小组全组三户，共十八口人，织草袋前，糠菜还吃不饱；织草袋后一月，三家老少都吃半粮半糠，还购置了麦种准备农业生产。
            加强供销社对生产的领导
    在该区领导生产自救中，还存在了一个较重要的缺陷，就是该区工作委员会，宁河县党政领导机关，没有充分运用交通方便，城乡交流等有利条件，有计划的发展灾区各项群众性的手工业，副业生产。对供销合作社的领导不够。致使供销社在救灾工作中，赶不上各项生产发展的需要。
    如宁河县位于天津唐山之间，京沈铁路穿境百余里，蓟运河流贯南北，交通很方便，全县拥有百余村的六大群众性副业。计治鱼、织席、草袋、柴草业、运输业、纺织业，但该县供销社却没有确切掌握全县各项生产情况，对大量的治鱼业，未加以扶助和组织，蓟运河冬季特产的银鱼、紫蟹，亦未引起供销社的注意。
    在各项生产初步开展后，如何加强供销社业务，有计划有组织的发展灾区生产，是宁河灾区急待解决的问题。
    中央人民政府拨来大批赈贷粮，并在发放过程强调结合组织生产，对该区生产救灾工作是个划阶段的开始。经验证明，正确发挥赈贷粮的作用，是组织灾民生产自救的重要关键。
            确切掌握灾情规定贷粮对象
    在发放贷粮开始之前，灾区工作委员会，组织干部力量，深入调查七个不同类型的灾村，确切研究灾情。当时宁宝重灾区的基本情况是：百分之十五的灾民，多为无劳力的孤寡户，生活无着，急需赈济；百分之六十五到七十生活困难，以糠菜糊口，加以物质扶助，才能进行生产；百分之二十上下，困难不大。针对上述情况，该区工作委员会，即明确规定：赈济粮发放对象是无劳力而又生活无着的孤寡户，发放范围不得超过总户数的百分之十五；各项生产贷粮发放对象是有劳力而生产中有困难的户，发放户数约计全村总户数百分之六十五上下。这是一个重要的准备工作，使基层干部发放贷粮时，心中有数。如韩天顺汪宁河一区发放救济粮时，村干部代表会上评议应赈户四十二户，占全村总户数百分之三十一强，引起韩天顺的怀疑，深入调查发现代表爱面子怕得罪人。另外只要是孤寡户，不问困难大小，认为应平均发放。最后用具体材料说服了村干部，二次认真评议只剩了二十户。
            从组织生产入手贷粮与生产紧密结合
    发放贷粮中，很多优秀干部，创造了发放贷粮紧密结合组织生产的宝贵经验。邳守玉在宁河倚岸村，把贷粮发放与组织生产紧紧的结合进行，他首先了解该村有二十只船停放着，加以修补后即可下水；全村八十四户，多数人家会织网；两户卖瓦盆停顿了；十一辆跑运输的车，六辆车缺本钱没活动等。他即召集船户开会，鼓励恢复生产的情绪，又进一步具体帮助船户们计算：修理船只，个人能自筹资金多少，实在不能解决的困难，政府加以扶助。然后由村代表会评议。结果，该村共计各项生产贷粮七千斤，只有一户吃掉五十斤，百分之九十九·七投入了生产。随着贷粮的支持，二十只船、五十九家织网的、十一辆运输大车、两户卖盆的都活动起来了。倚岸村的群众反映：生产如合面，政府的贷粮是“面肥”，放上“面肥”面便“发”起来了。
            发放贷粮中偏向，由于领导生产思想不明确。
    发放贷粮的过程，即组织生产的过程。由于某些干部对这一方针领会的不够，在发放贷粮中曾发生以下偏向：
    一、不了解灾民情况，不问困难大小，平均“放粮”。如宝坻八区张胡庄，把三百斤麦种，平均分给十三户，真正困难户得粮很少，不能解决麦种困难。
    二、发放贷粮与组织生产脱节，灾民不组织起来，便不发贷粮。宁河一区胡庄子，拨发该村的各项贷粮七千斤，只发下两千斤，原因是区干部没具体帮助群众找生产门路，又怕群众把贷粮吃掉。
    三、不认真解决灾民生产中的具体困难，以致灾民急需扶助，却积存大批粮食不发。宁河一区两个月内，各项生产贷粮总数四十万斤，至三月中旬，仍有二十万斤未发到灾民手中。
