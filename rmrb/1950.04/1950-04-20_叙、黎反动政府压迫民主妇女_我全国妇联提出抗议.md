　　Syrian and Lebanese Reactionary Governments Suppress Democratic Women
    All-China Women's Federation Protests

    [Xinhua News Agency, April 18th] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received a letter from Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, reporting the atrocities of the Syrian and Lebanese reactionary governments in suppressing democratic women during this year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. The letter called on democratic women's federations in various countries to widely expose these facts and protest to the reactionary rulers. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation replied to the Women's International Democratic Federation on April 18th, warmly responding to their proposal, expressing the greatest indignation and protesting against the atrocities of the Syrian and Lebanese governments who serve imperialism; and expressing cordial and warm greetings to the persecuted sisters. Excerpts from the two letters are as follows:

    (I) Letter from the Women's International Democratic Federation
    Dear Friends,

    On "March 8th" International Working Women's Day - our great day of unity, the women of Syria and Lebanon, disregarding the atrocities of reactionary police suppression, are fighting with unparalleled courage and determination for peace and the happiness of their children.

    (The following is a report on events that occurred in Syria and Lebanon)

    On March 8th, women in Damascus, the capital of Syria, participated in a rally organized by the Syrian Women and Infants Protection Association, and then began a demonstration.

    When the marching column reached the front of the National Assembly Building and demanded that the National Assembly condemn the war and formulate a constitution in line with peace, it was brutally attacked by the police, slogans were torn down, women were beaten, and three people were arrested. Amineh Alef, a representative attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, her mother and five-year-old younger sister, and another woman were arrested and imprisoned.

    In Homs, hundreds of women demonstrated with flags, demanding peace and the freedom and happiness of Syrian women. The police brutally dispersed the demonstrating masses, and many women were beaten and arrested, including Salma Buni, a representative attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, and five young students.

    On March 12th, in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, the Lebanese Women's Rights League held a demonstration, shouting slogans demanding "Peace, Bread, and Freedom." The police attacked the marching ranks and arrested twenty-seven women and their babies, including Victoria El-Helou, a representative attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference.

    The facts are obvious: American imperialism covets the oil and military strategic bases of the Middle East, creates puppet governments, and despises the lives and happiness of women and children. Sisters in semi-colonial countries are fighting to get rid of the terrible disasters of the people and to win bread and peace. Because of their heroic and just actions, they are being suppressed by the reactionary rulers.

                            Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation

    (II) Reply from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    To Madame Vaillant-Couturier and dear friends,

    We express our greatest indignation at the atrocities of the Syrian and Lebanese governments, who are willing to serve imperialism, in suppressing democratic women, and have lodged protests with them separately, expressing our most cordial and warmest greetings to the persecuted sisters.

    From the active participation of women from various Middle Eastern countries in the movement to defend peace, it is fully proven that the sisters from various Middle Eastern countries have closely stood together with peace-loving people all over the world, and have bravely demonstrated their determination to fight for world peace and democracy in the face of police violence. Please convey the warm greetings of our 235 million women of China to the fighting sisters in Syria and Lebanon! Please tell them that we vow to do our utmost to support their just actions.

                          Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

　　叙、黎反动政府压迫民主妇女
    我全国妇联提出抗议
    【新华社十八日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会最近收到国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬·古久里夫人的来信，信中报道了今年“三八”国际劳动妇女节叙利亚和黎巴嫩反动政府压迫民主妇女的暴行，号召各国民主妇联广泛揭露这些事实，并向反动统治者提出抗议。中华全国民主妇联已于四月十八日函复国际民主妇联，热烈响应她们的提议，对于甘为帝国主义服务的叙利亚和黎巴嫩政府的暴行，表示最大的愤慨并提出抗议；对于受迫害的姊妹们，表示亲切热烈的慰问。两信的摘要如下：
    （一）国际民主妇联来函亲爱的朋友们：
    在“三八”国际劳动妇女节——我们团结一致的伟大日子，叙利亚和黎巴嫩的妇女，不顾反动警察镇压的暴行，用无比的勇气，决心为和平，为孩子的幸福而斗争着。
    （以下是关于在叙利亚与黎巴嫩所发生的事件的报告）
    三月八日在叙利亚首都大马士革的妇女，参加了叙利亚妇婴保卫联合会组织的集会之后，开始游行示威。
    当游行队伍走到国会大厦门前，提出要求国民议会斥责战争，制定符合和平的宪法时，竟遭受到警察残暴的袭击，标语被撕毁，妇女们被毒打，有三个人被捕。出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表阿米涅·阿莱芙和她的母亲及五岁的小妹妹，还有另外一个妇女被逮捕入狱。
    在荷姆斯，数百妇女高举着旗帜示威，要求和平，要求叙利亚妇女的自由与幸福。警察野蛮地冲散了示威的群众，许多妇女挨打被捕，其中有出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表萨尔玛·布尼，及青年学生五人。
    三月十二日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁斯，黎巴嫩妇女权利同盟举行了游行示威，喊出了要求“和平、面包与自由”的口号，警察袭击了游行的行列，逮捕了二十七个妇女和她们的婴儿，其中有出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表维多利亚·爱尔·海露。
    事实是很明显的，美帝国主义垂涎着中东的石油与军事战略基地，制造傀儡政府，藐视妇女与儿童的生命与幸福。在半殖民地国家的姊妹们正在为摆脱人民的可怕灾难，为争取面包、和平而斗争。由于她们这种正义的英勇的行为，她们正受到反动统治者的镇压。
                            国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬·古久里
    （二）中华全国民主妇女联合会的复函古久里夫人并转亲爱的朋友们：
    我们对于甘为帝国主义服务的叙利亚和黎巴嫩政府压迫民主妇女的暴行，表示最大的愤慨，已经分别向其提出抗议，对于受迫害的姊妹们，表示最亲切最热烈的慰问。
    从这次中东各国妇女的积极参加保卫和平的运动中，充分地证明了中东各国的姊妹们，已经紧密地和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为了争取世界的和平民主，在警察的暴力面前，英勇地表现了她们斗争的决心。请把我们全中国二万万三千五百万妇女的热情慰问传达给叙利亚和黎巴嫩的正在斗争中的姊妹们！请告诉她们，我们誓以最大努力来支援她们的正义行动。
                          中华全国民主妇女联合会主席  蔡畅
