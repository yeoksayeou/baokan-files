From a Northeast Daily News dispatch from Shenyang: Kim Jun-hee, a special-class agricultural labor model in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, achieved a yield of 182 jin of seed cotton per mu in his third year (last year) of trial planting cotton in Dongning County, Songjiang Province, located at 44 degrees 01 minutes north latitude. This already surpasses the average yield of 120 jin per mu of cotton fields in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces. This presents agricultural technicians with a new problem worth studying: According to the supposedly scientific conclusions of the puppet Manchukuo period, cotton could not be planted in areas north of 43 degrees 40 minutes north latitude. However, Ning'an County is located 61 minutes north of the point designated by the puppet Manchukuo. Is this a practical application of the theory that plants gradually acquire new habits—that cotton can gradually migrate northward and become a cold-resistant variety? This requires further experimentation by Kim Jun-hee, with assistance from agricultural technicians. If good harvests are obtained again this year, it will prove to be a major success, thereby changing the landscape of Northeast China, which previously could only grow cotton in Southern Manchuria and Rehe, enabling the vast land of Northern Manchuria to also grow cotton and supply the textile industry in large quantities.

Kim Jun-hee's main experience in trial planting cotton in Northern Manchuria is: to make the cotton blossom early and avoid frost damage (the reason why Northern Manchuria was previously considered unsuitable for cotton planting was the early frost season). To achieve this goal, it is necessary to top and prune the cotton plants and maintain a certain distance between plants. As for the objective conditions, according to the preliminary understanding of the Fiber Crops Section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, they are as follows: (1) The land is on a sunny slope on the north side of a mountain, with a high elevation and good drainage; (2) The soil contains a lot of sandy material; (3) The village is surrounded by mountains on all sides, which can prevent strong winds; (4) Part of the variety was imported from Korea.

　　农业方面值得研究的新问题！
    北满劳动英雄试种棉花成功
    提早开桃避免霜害产量竟超南满
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：东北松江省特等农业劳动模范金俊熙在北纬四十四度零一分的松江省东宁县试种棉花的第三年（去年），一亩棉田产籽棉一百八十二斤，已高于现在辽东、辽西两省每亩棉田一百二十斤的平均产量。这给目前农业技术工作者提出了一个值得研究的新问题：根据伪满时期认为科学的结论，在北纬四十三度四十分以北的地区根本不能种植棉花，但宁安县在地图上却北于伪满所做出的结论点达六十一分，这是否就是植物逐渐获得新的习性的理论的实践——棉花可以逐渐北移，变成耐寒品种。这有待于金俊熙继续试验，并由农业技术人员加以帮助，今年如果仍获好收，那将证明确是一大成功，从而将改变东北只能在南满和热河种植棉花的面貌，使北满的辽阔的土地上也生长出棉花来，大量供应纺织工业需要。
    金俊熙在北满试种棉花的主要经验是：使棉花提早开桃，不受霜害（过去认为北满不能植棉的原因是霜期早），而要达此目的必须打尖打杈，并保持棵与棵间的距离。至于客观条件，据农林部纤维作物科的初步了解是这样：（一）土地是北山阳坡，地势较高，泄水良好；（二）土壤含沙质多；（三）该村四面环山，能防强风；（四）品种中一部为朝鲜输入。
