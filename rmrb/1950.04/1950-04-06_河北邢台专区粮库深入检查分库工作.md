　　Hebei Xingtai Special District Grain Depot Conducts In-Depth Inspection of Branch Depots

　　[This Dispatch] To strengthen the work of its branch depots, the Xingtai Special District Grain Depot in Hebei Province has organized five inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections and provide specific assistance to various counties. The inspection teams departed in early March and plan to complete the transfer and transportation of grain before the spring plowing. The overall task for the first half of the year is to clear out the old and build the new, in order to minimize or prevent grain spoilage this year, learn from and exchange various experiences in storage and security work, and establish various systems for the future. Before the cadres went down, they were ideologically mobilized, believing that the decision to implement such unified management was extremely important. Feng Guangyu, director of the district depot, said: "We believe that the decision of the Central People's Government's State Council to unify the nation's financial and economic work is extremely wise. Some people think that with unified management from above, lower levels can be irresponsible. This is a misunderstanding; on the contrary, we must be more active and responsible, looking at the big picture and thinking about the whole, in order to benefit the country and the people." Each inspection team consists of three to four people, responsible for inspecting three branch depots, and it was decided to start with key counties first. The entire special district has a total of fifteen branch depots, with Shahe, Xingtai, and Nanhe forming one group, with Shahe as the key. Neiqiu, Lincheng, and Baixiang form one group, with Neiqiu as the key. Renxian, Longyao, and Julu form one group, with Renxian as the key. Pingxiang, Weixian, and Guangzong form one group, with Weixian as the key. Ningjin, Nangong, and Xinhe form one group, with Nangong as the key. In terms of specific methods, the county branch depots first raise any difficulties they have with the grain depot work, and then explain the main significance of this inspection. It is stipulated that each group should report to the district grain depot every three days after going down. All groups arrived in the key counties by March 9th and began inspection work. This will play a certain role in implementing unified financial and economic management. (Xu Zizhen, Communications Section, Xingtai District Committee)

　　河北邢台专区粮库深入检查分库工作
    【本报讯】河北邢台专区区粮库，为了加强各分库工作，特组织了五个检查组，分赴各县进行深入检查和具体帮助。各检查组已于三月上旬出发，并计划在春耕前完成调粮运粮。上半年作好清旧建新的总任务，以达到今年不坏或少坏粮食，吸取和交流保管、保卫工作的各种经验，建立今后各种制度。各干部在未下去前，在思想上均作了动员，认为实行这样统一管理的决定，是极其重要的措施。区库主任冯光裕说：“我们认为中央人民政府政务院统一全国财经工作的决定是非常英明的，有人以为上面统一管理了，下级就可不负责任，这是一种误解；相反的，我们更要积极负责，要往大处着眼，整体着想，以便造福国家与人民。”检查组每组三人至四人，负责检查三个分库，并确定先从重点县入手。全专区共十五个分库，规定沙河、邢台、南和为一组，以沙河为重点。内邱、临城、柏乡一组，内邱为重点。任县、隆尧、巨鹿为一组，任县为重点。平乡、威县、广宗一组，威县为重点。宁晋、南宫、新河一组，南宫为重点。在具体作法上，首先由县分库提出对粮库工作有那些困难，然后说明这次检查的主要意义。并规定各组于下去后，每三天向区粮库汇报一次。各组于三月九日均已到达重点县，着手进行检查工作。这在贯彻财经统一管理上，将起一定的作用。（邢台地委会通讯科许子真）
