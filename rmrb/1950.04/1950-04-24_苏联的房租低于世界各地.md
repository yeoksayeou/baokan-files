　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: TASS reports that rents in the Soviet Union are the lowest in the world. Rent expenditures for Soviet working families account for only 4 percent of the family budget. Larger buildings in the cities belong to the local Soviets, industrial enterprises, or government ministries. These buildings are charged according to a nationally uniform standard for rent and miscellaneous fees. Monthly rent only includes the necessary costs of actually occupied rooms, heating, water, and the salaries of building management staff. Other facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms are free of charge.
    The huge expenses required for renovating and repairing apartment buildings are shared by the local Soviets and various enterprises. In the past three years, Moscow alone has repaired 28,000 apartment buildings, spending a total of 1.18 billion rubles.

　　苏联的房租低于世界各地
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的房租是全世界最低廉的。苏联工人家庭的房租支出仅占家庭预算的百分之四。各城较大的房屋都属于当地苏维埃、工业企业或政府各部。这些房屋都按全国划一的房租及杂费标准收费。每月房租仅包括实际住人的房间、热力、水的必需费用及房屋管理员工的薪资。其他如厨房、浴室等设备，都无需付费。
    改建、修理公寓房屋所需的浩大费用，由地方苏维埃及各企业分担。在过去三年中，仅莫斯科一地就修理了二万八千所公寓房子，共支出了十一亿八千万卢布。
