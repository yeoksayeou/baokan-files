Xinhua News Agency, April 25th -- The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a National Soil and Fertilizer Conference in Beijing from April 11th to 24th. More than 80 people attended the conference, including agricultural administrative cadres from major administrative regions and provinces, soil experts and professors from various places, and representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government.

The conference focused on studying how to restore and improve soil fertility to achieve increased grain and cotton production, and finally formulated several specific implementation plans for soil improvement: (1) Soil investigation and research: It was decided to complete the investigation of large areas of wasteland within three to five years and to map detailed plans for the utilization of wasteland. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government will organize four investigation teams to first conduct investigations and mapping in the Bohai and Northern Jiangsu saline-alkali areas, the Yellow River flooded area, and Northeast China this year, and then conduct investigations in the red soil areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. (2) Rational utilization of wasteland: It is planned to begin reclaiming one million mu of wasteland in the Bohai and Northern Jiangsu saline-alkali areas this year; the land planning work for the wasteland in the Yellow River flooded area must be completed before the local land reform is implemented, and forest shelter belts will be established, pasture will be planted, and crop rotation will be implemented; the rational utilization of land in the red soil area will begin in the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong, and it was decided to plant as much pasture and leguminous plants as possible, implement crop rotation, and apply lime to adjust soil acidity. (3) Soil and water conservation: It is planned to establish soil and water conservation experimental zones in North China, Northeast China, East China, the Yellow River flooded area, and the Sichuan Basin, and establish demonstration farms to absorb and promote the experience of alternating sweet clover and wheat. (4) Fertilizer: It was decided to focus on increasing fertilizer application, improving management methods, and improving application methods. In addition to organizing urban manure to be sent to the countryside and increasing the production of chemical fertilizers, it will also massively plant pasture, promote green manure, and implement crop rotation.

In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the conference decided that in the future, it will universally carry out publicity and education, launch a mass movement for rational land use and soil improvement, and at the same time strengthen the organizational work of soil improvement and train technical cadres at all levels; in addition, in order to carry out the work of establishing forest shelter belts, dredging rivers, and increasing the production of chemical fertilizers, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Industry of the Central People's Government will closely cooperate.

　　农业部召开土壤肥料会议
    拟定具体计划改良土壤增产粮棉
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府农业部于四月十一日至二十四日在京召开全国土壤肥料会议。参加会议的共八十余人，其中有各大行政区和省的农业行政干部，各地土壤学专家和教授：并有中央人民政府水利部和林垦部的代表参加。
    这次会议曾着重地研究如何恢复和提高土壤肥力以达到粮棉增产的目的，最后拟定了改良土壤的几项具体实施的计划：（一）土壤的调查研究：决定在三、五年内完成大片荒地的调查工作，测绘荒地利用规划详图。由中央人民政府农业部组织四个调查团，于今年开始分赴渤海、苏北两盐碱区、黄泛区和东北等地先行调查测绘，然后再往江西、湖南、福建、广东、广西等地红壤区进行调查。（二）荒地的合理利用：计划今年开始在渤海和苏北两盐碱区开垦荒地一百万亩；黄泛区的荒地须在当地实行土地改革前完成土地的规划工作，并将建立森林防护带，种植牧草，实行轮栽；红壤区的土地合理利用，首先在广东雷州半岛做起，决定将尽量种植牧草和豆科植物，实行轮栽，同时施用石灰调剂土壤酸度。（三）水土的保持：计划在华北、东北、华东、黄泛区和四川盆地建立水土保持的实验区，成立示范农场，以吸取并推广天水草木犀与小麦相轮作的经验。（四）肥料：决定以增施肥料、改善管理方法和使用方法为主，除组织城粪下乡和增制化学肥料外，并将大量种植牧草、推广绿肥和实行轮栽。
    为了保证上述计划的实现，大会决定今后将普遍地进行宣传教育，展开群众性的土地合理利用和土壤改良运动，同时并将加强改良土壤的组织工作，培养各级技术干部；此外，为了进行建立森林防护带、疏浚河道、增造化学肥料等工作，中央人民政府林垦、水利、工业等部门将密切配合。
