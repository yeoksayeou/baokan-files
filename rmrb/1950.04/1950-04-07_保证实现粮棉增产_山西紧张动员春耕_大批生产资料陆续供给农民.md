    Guaranteeing Increased Grain and Cotton Production:
    Shanxi Intensively Mobilizes for Spring Plowing
    Large Quantities of Production Materials Continuously Supplied to Farmers
    [This newspaper, Taiyuan News] To ensure the successful completion of spring plowing, Shanxi Province has carried out intensive organization and mobilization work. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party committees at the special and county levels, in order to enhance the understanding of rural Party members and cadres regarding organizing and leading mass production, have rotated training for one-third of the rural Party members and cadres in most areas of the province since last winter. They also conducted special investigations of typical rural areas, providing materials for the government to formulate specific plans. Currently, under the leadership of Communist Party members, various localities are democratically and voluntarily rectifying existing mutual aid organizations and extensively launching mutual aid movements. For example, the Chinese Communist Party's Daliang Village branch in Wu Xiang educated Party members to actively organize and rectify mutual aid teams, leading 90% of the village's labor force to voluntarily organize, delivering 12,000 loads of manure in ten days. In Nanjiao Village, Huguan, all 82 households in the village, under the leadership of Party members, voluntarily formed 14 production mutual aid teams.

    The Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation at all levels have also fully mobilized the vast number of rural youth and women to participate in spring plowing. According to statistics from 8,000 village branches of the Communist Youth League, under the leadership of the branches in various localities, 46,814 young people have been organized to participate in mutual aid for spring plowing, accounting for 76.3% of the total number of young people. According to materials from 160 villages in various counties, 36,734 women, in order to fully participate in the spring plowing movement, ground a total of 50,341 *shi* of flour and made more than 380,000 pairs of shoes and socks, enough to meet most of the needs during the spring plowing period. This achievement was mainly obtained under the leadership of the Women's Federation in various villages.

    As the best organizational form for leading spring plowing production, people's representative conferences at all levels have been convened in most counties except for six counties that have not yet convened them. Sixteen counties, including Changzhi and Huguan, have held the second meeting. Most of the time in the meetings was spent discussing production issues, especially focusing on the current spring plowing work.

    Various counties have also successively convened model worker conferences and production exhibitions, focusing on studying technical leadership and mutual aid organizations. Thirty counties, including Zhongyang and Licheng, have successively completed the conferences and discussed the organization of women's work and individual production increase plans, further improving the model workers in terms of ideology and experience, and strengthening the organizational backbone of this year's production movement.

    At the same time, the People's Government is providing farmers with material and technical assistance as much as possible. The provincial government is successively supplying farmers with 150,000 *jin* of Si-brand cotton seeds, 684,000 *jin* of oil cake, 300 tons of fertilizer powder, 5,000 new-style waterwheels, 2,763 sprayers, 370 Liberation-style cultivating hoes, and 32,000 *jin* of red alum. The Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China is providing agricultural loans of 9.4 million *jin* of millet to assist farmers in obtaining necessary production materials such as water conservancy, breeding livestock, farm tools, and pesticides, and is currently distributing them in rural areas. Six hundred and sixty agricultural technicians trained in Changzhi, Yicheng, Xingxian, Linfen, Taiyuan, and other places have now returned to the countryside to help farmers with seed selection, planting, and pest control during spring plowing. Under the impetus of various organizational forces and with the assistance of government materials and technology, the spring plowing movement in the province has been launched enthusiastically.

    【本报太原讯】保证春耕胜利完成，山西省进行了紧张的组织动员工作。中共山西省委及各专、县级党委，为了提高农村党员、干部对组织领导群众生产的认识，自去冬以来，轮训了全省大部地区农村党员干部三分之一。并专门进行了典型农村调查，提供政府制订具体计划材料。目前在共产党员带头下，各地正民主自愿地整顿已有的互助组织及广泛开展互助运动。如武乡中共大良村支部教育党员起来积极组织整顿互助组，带动全村百分之九十的劳力都自动组织起来，十天送粪一万两千担。壶关南郊村，全村八十二户，在党员带头下，自愿的组成了十四个生产互助组。
    各地青年团、妇联会也都全力发动广大农村的青年团、妇女涌进春耕。据青年团八千个村支部统计，在各地支部领导下，组织起四万六千八百一十四个青年参加互助进行春耕，占青年总数的百分之七十六点三。据各县一百六十个村的材料统计，三万六千七百三十四个妇女，为了全力参加春耕运动，共磨面五万零三百四十一石，做鞋袜三十八万余双，够春耕期间大部需用。这一成绩主要是在各村妇联会领导下取得的。
    作为领导春耕生产的最好组织形式的各界人民代表会议，全省除六个县尚未召开外，绝大部分县都已召开，长治、壶关等十六县，已开过第二次。会议中大部时间都是讨论生产问题，尤其是集中的研究了目前春耕工作。
    各县并陆续召开劳模大会。生产展览会，着重研究了技术领导与互助组织。中阳、黎城等三十个县已先后召开完毕，并讨论了组织妇女工作，和个人的增产计划。使劳模们从思想上、经验上提高一步。加强了今年生产运动的组织骨干。
    同时，人民政府尽可能给农民以物质技术援助。省府正陆续供给农民斯字棉种十五万斤，油饼六十八万四千斤，肥田粉三百吨，新式水车五千辆，喷雾器二千七百六十三架，解放式耕锄三百七十个，红矾三万二千斤。中国人民银行山西省分行以九百四十万斤小米的农业贷款扶助农民取得水利、种畜、农具、农药等必需生产资料，现正深入农村发放。长治、翼城、兴县、临汾、太原等地训练的六百六十个农业技术人员，现已回到乡村，帮助农民在春耕中进行选种、种植、除害工作。在各种组织力量的推动下，在政府物资技术的援助下，全省春耕运动，已热烈开展。
