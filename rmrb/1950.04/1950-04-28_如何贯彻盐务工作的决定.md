How to Implement the Decision on Salt Affairs Work

The State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on National Salt Affairs Work" on March 12th. This decision is a landmark document in the history of salt administration in New China! It not only comprehensively summarizes the past salt affairs work but also, based on the national economic plan and in conjunction with the current actual situation of salt affairs in various parts of the country, determines the future direction and the specific steps for the division of production, sales, and taxation management.

With the victorious development of the revolutionary situation, we quickly took over all the salt fields on the Chinese mainland in 1949. Over the past year, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the active efforts of salt field workers, not only have the salt field production equipment that was wantonly destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits been gradually restored, but also the new democratic production management has been gradually realized, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of salt workers for production and significantly increasing output, achieving preliminary results. This is mainly reflected in:

First, the production plan was completed, and some exceeded the estimated output, and exceeded the output during the Kuomintang reactionary rule in 1948. For example, in the Changlu Salt District, the Kuomintang produced 7 million dan of salt in 1948, and our estimated number for 1949 was 9.5 million dan, while the actual output reached more than 14.9 million dan. In the Northeast Salt District, only 8 million dan were produced during the Kuomintang period in 1948, while our actual output in 1949 reached more than 16.26 million dan. Other regions have also made significant progress. This clearly shows that we have made achievements in production.

Second, we took over the salt fields and salt production equipment of the Kuomintang reactionary government and turned them into the property of the people's country, consolidating the foundation of state-owned salt fields, expanding the management of state-owned salt flats, and, under the principle of "both public and private, benefiting both labor and capital" in private salt flats, changed the feudal exploitative relationship between the beach owners and salt workers and began to establish new democratic production relations.

However, with the formation of a unified national situation, some problems that need to be solved urgently have also arisen in salt affairs work. The first is that the salt affairs laws and regulations in the liberated areas across the country are not unified, and each region's salt bureau has its own set of plans, systems, and methods. Therefore, there is insufficient contact between salt affairs agencies or between salt affairs agencies and other agencies. Because each wants to do its job well, it sometimes has a negative impact on the overall work; coupled with insufficient cooperation, and lack of timely exchange of experience and intelligence, it is inevitable that there will be a tendency towards blind production and blind sales in specific work, urgently requiring unified leadership and unified planning to completely eliminate the phenomenon of scrambling for markets and low-price dumping caused by supply shortages and oversupply in individual regions. Secondly, the division of labor in salt affairs varies from region to region. The Northeast Salt Bureau only manages production, not sales and taxation; the Changlu Salt Bureau manages both production and taxation, and the sales are transferred to the salt industry company; in East China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and the Two Guangdongs, the salt bureaus uniformly manage production, sales, and taxation. Due to the above problems, salt affairs work in various regions inevitably encounters some difficulties, which inevitably affects the people's livelihood and tax revenue. Therefore, unifying salt administration has become an urgent demand of the people of the whole country and salt affairs workers. The "Decision on National Salt Affairs Work" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government clearly points out the way to solve these problems and the direction for the future.

How to implement this decision is the central key to ensuring that the national salt affairs work continues to move forward. We believe that it is necessary to:

First, resolutely implement the production policy of "both public and private systems, determining production based on sales, improving quality, increasing output, and reducing costs." We should follow this instruction from the Central Government, recognize the rich characteristics of salt production in our country, and combine it with the specific conditions in various localities. First of all, we must restore and develop valuable and promising salt fields; increase their capital, improve their equipment, reduce their costs, and increase their output and quality so as to gradually push them towards rationalization and industrialization. Any salt fields without economic value should not be restored or supported. Only to take care of the current difficulties of salt-making households and salt workers, it is allowed to temporarily maintain the status quo; once the conditions are ripe in the future, it will still be gradually reduced and abolished. If we simply proceed from the point of view of relief, advocate the development of salt fields with poor quality, high costs, scattered production areas, and difficult management, or organize salt workers who have already changed their professions to restore salt fields that should not be restored; although it may solve some difficulties in the current local area, it will add new difficulties to future reductions, abolitions, and transfers, which is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Furthermore, taking local salt as an example: the cost is high, the quality is poor, and the production areas are scattered and difficult to manage. If it is allowed to develop, it will not only affect people's health, but also destroy the production and sales plan and affect the tax revenue plan because local salt encroaches on the sea salt market. According to recent investigation materials from a part of the China Salt Industry Corporation: in January and February of this year, the company's sales of Changlu salt were reduced by as much as 125,000 dan due to the impact of local salt and the flushing sales problem in the North China region. Judging from the original salt sales plan for January and February, the sales volume of the North China Company only completed 28.34% of the original plan, which shows that the problem is serious. It is hoped that all localities will quickly study and stop it in accordance with the decision on national salt affairs work; otherwise, our production and sales tasks will not be completed, and the country's financial difficulties will increase.

Second, resolutely implement the tax revenue policy of "increasing tax rates, no double taxation, assessing by quantity, and collecting on-site": First of all, we should clearly recognize that our salt tax policy this year, although "increasing tax rates," is "no double taxation." Our tax rates are based on the actual conditions of each salt region, using grain as the calculation standard, and are uniformly assessed by the central government by region and category, starting with the three regions of North China, East China, and South China, and the General Salt Affairs Bureau is responsible for controlling and uniformly assessing. These measures can not only adjust surpluses and deficits to balance the burden on the people but also cooperate with the production and sales plan to guarantee national revenue, which is correct in the current situation. However, some people think that the salt tax is unfair, is a poll tax, and should not be increased; some even advocate not collecting taxes. This only sees one aspect and does not see it from a comprehensive perspective. Historically, salt tax in our country has always been one of the main sources of fiscal revenue, and it currently ranks third in terms of proportion of tax revenue. We admit that the salt tax is indeed unfair to be borne equally per capita, but from a fiscal point of view, because the burden is widespread and everyone has to eat it, the tax source is quite reliable. Moreover, the amount required per person is limited, averaging only eight jin per year, unlike other things that are consumed in large quantities, so the burden is relatively light. This explains why the salt tax is raised and proves that it does not have a large impact on people's lives. In order to overcome financial difficulties and cooperate with economic construction, we cannot ignore the needs of the people's national finance and should appropriately increase the salt tax from the long-term interests of the people. What's more, the current salt tax is only slightly higher than our previous period of light taxes but is much lighter than during the Kuomintang rule before the war. According to historical materials: in 1936, the salt tax per dan in Shandong was equivalent to more than 180 jin of millet, and we are now only equivalent to 100 jin, and in areas with low grain prices, it is only 120 jin. This proves that today's salt tax is not heavy.

Third, resolutely implement the salt affairs anti-smuggling policy of "basically relying on organizing the masses to crack down on smuggling, but also appropriately expanding the anti-smuggling armed forces, combining product anti-smuggling with sales area anti-smuggling, and cooperating with other anti-smuggling efforts to achieve mutual assistance." Our country's salt areas are vast, and the situation is different, so the production costs in the production areas vary, and the selling prices in the sales areas are also different; after this tax increase, due to the unsound management of salt administration and the differences in the standards of physical objects and the level of grain prices in various places, the salt prices are divergent, and smuggling is rampant. Recently, it has been discovered that some speculators and vendors mix mirabilite, white stones, and bittern slag into the salt, taking the opportunity to confuse and disrupt the market and harm people's health; in addition, local salt takes the opportunity to develop, and salt products encroach on each other; Northeast salt enters the customs area beyond the region, and Changlu salt encroaches on East China. Based on the above situation, we must convince cadres, educate the masses, raise their political consciousness, and launch a movement to protect the salt fields and protect taxes.

Fourth, resolutely implement the sales policy of "both public and private transportation and sales." We should strengthen the planning of transportation and sales work, formulate plans based on local transportation conditions, population distribution, and economic conditions, adjust surpluses and deficits, and ensure supply. Minimize intermediate exploitation, so as to reduce the burden on the people and achieve small profits but quick turnover. These responsibilities are in areas where production and sales are separated (such as North China, East China, and Central South). It is hoped that the China Salt Industry Corporation will establish branches and combine with cooperatives and absorb the strength of private merchants to strive for the successful completion of the task. As for areas where production and sales have not yet been divided (such as the Northwest and Southwest), the salt affairs agencies should resolutely implement this decision of the Central People's Government in accordance with the aforementioned principles.

### 如何贯彻盐务工作的决定

　　如何贯彻盐务工作的决定
    中央人民政府政务院三月十二日公布了“全国盐务工作的决定”。这个决定，是新中国盐政史上划时代的重大文献！不但概括地总结了过去的盐务工作，并且根据国家经济计划，结合目前全国各地盐务实际情况，决定了今后的方针和产、销、税分工管理的具体步骤。
    随着革命形势的胜利发展，我们于一九四九年迅速的先后接管了中国大陆上的全部盐场。一年来，在人民政府正确领导和盐场工人积极努力之下，不但已经把被蒋匪横加破坏了的盐田生产设备，逐步地恢复过来，而且渐次地实现了新民主主义的生产管理，使盐工生产热忱大大提高，产量大大增加，获得了初步的成绩。主要表现在：
    一、完成了生产计划，有的超过了预计产额，且较一九四八年国民党反动统治时期的产额超过很多。如长芦盐区一九四八年国民党时期产盐七○○万担，一九四九年我们预计数为九五○万担，而实产数达一、四九○余万担。又如东北盐区，一九四八年国民党时期仅产八○○万担，一九四九年我们实产量达一、六二六余万担，其他地区都有显著进步，这些很明显的说明了我们在生产上是有成绩的。
    二、我们接收了国民党反动政府的盐田及产盐设备，成为人民国家的财产，巩固了国营盐场的基础，扩大了国营盐滩的经营，并在私营盐滩本“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的原则下，改变了滩主与盐工间的封建剥削关系，开始建立了新民主主义的生产关系。
    可是，随着全国统一局面的形成，在盐务工作上也带来了一些迫待解决的问题，首先就是全国各解放区盐务法令不统一，各区盐局各有一套计划、制度、和办法。因此盐务机关相互间，或盐务机关与其他机关间，联系不够。因为各自都想把自己的工作作好，有时对整体工作造成不良影响；再加互相配合不够，及时交流经验与情报也不够，在具体工作上，就难免发生盲目的生产与盲目的运销的倾向，迫切要求统一领导，统一计划，以彻底扫除个别地区由于供不应求与供给过剩而造成的争夺市场低价侵销的现象。其次是各地区在盐务分工上不一致，东北盐局只管生产，运销税收不管；长芦盐局兼管生产税收，将运销划交盐业公司；华东、西南、西北、两广则是生产运销税收都由盐局统一管理。由于以上存在的问题，就必然地使得各地区盐务工作上遭遇到一些困难，结果是不可免地影响了民食和税收。因此统一盐政，也就成为全国人民和盐务工作者的迫切要求。中央人民政府政务院公布的“全国盐务工作的决定”，则明确地指出了解决这些问题的道路和今后的方向。
    如何贯彻实现这个决定，是保证今后全国盐务工作继续向前迈进的中心关键，我们认为必须：
    一、坚决执行“公私兼制，按销定产，提高质量，增加产量，减低成本”的生产方针。我们应该遵照中央这一指示，认清我国盐务生产丰富的特点，并结合目前各地的具体情况，首先要恢复与发展有价值有前途的盐场；增加其资金，改进其设备，减低其成本，提高其产量与质量，使之逐渐推向合理化工业化。凡无经济价值的盐场，都不应恢复与扶持，只是为了照顾制盐户及盐工的目前困难，允许暂时维持原状；一待将来条件成熟，还是要逐渐裁废的。如果单纯的从救济观点出发，提倡发展那种质量差、成本高、产区分散、难以管理的盐场，或把已经转业的盐工组织起来，恢复不应恢复的盐场；在目前局部看来，虽可解决一些困难，但对将来裁废转业，却又增加新的困难，挖肉补疮得不偿失。再以土盐而论：成本既高，质量又差，且产地散漫不易管理，如果任其发展，不但影响人民健康，而且由于土盐侵销海盐市场；破坏了产销计划，影响了税收计划。仅据最近中国盐业公司一部分调查材料：本年一二月份在华北地区由于土盐及冲销问题的影响，使公司本身芦盐少销即达十二万五千担。从原订一二月份销盐计划来看，华北公司销售量仅完成原计划百分之二八·三四，足见问题是严重的。希望各地根据全国盐务工作的决定，很快的研究制止；否则我们的产销任务便不能完成，增加了国家的财政困难。
    二、坚决执行“提高税额，税不重征，从量核定，就场征收”的税收方针：首先应明确的认识我们今年的盐税政策，虽然“提高税额”，但却“税不重征。”我们的税率是根据各盐区的实际情况，以粮为计算标准，由中央分区分类统一核定的，并先从华北、华东、华南三个地区作起，由盐务总局负责掌握统一核定。这些措施，既可调剂盈虚平衡民负，又可配合产销计划，保证国家收入，这在目前情况下是正确的。但有些人，认为盐税不公平，是人头税，不应提高；甚至有人主张不征税，这是只看到了一方面，没有从全面去看，我国盐税在历史上，向为财政主要收入之一，目前且在比重上占着税收的第三位。我们承认：盐税按人口平均负担，确是不公平的，但从财政上看，因负担面广，人人都要食用，所以税源相当可靠。又以每人需量有限，每年平均不过八斤，不像其他东西消耗量大，所以负担比较亦极轻微。这就说明了盐税为什么提高，并证明了是对人民生活的影响不大的。为了克服财政困难，配合经济建设，我们不能忽视人民国家财政的需要，应当从人民长远利益出发，适当的提高盐税。何况事实上目前的盐税，不过比我们以前轻税时期增加了一些，但比战前国民党统治时期还轻的多。据历史材料：一九三六年山东每担盐税折合小米一百八十余斤，我们现在仅折合一百斤，粮价低的地区，亦只一百二十斤。足以证明今天的盐税并不算重。
    三、坚决执行“基本上要依靠组织群众缉私，但亦应适当地扩大缉私武装，使产品与销区缉私相结合，并配合其他缉私，以收互助之效”的盐务缉私方针。我国盐区辽阔，情况不同，因而产地的采制成本不一，销场的售价亦殊；这次增税后，由于盐政管理不够健全，各地实物标准和粮价高低不同，以致盐价分歧，走私猖獗。近更发现部分投机商贩，以芒硝，白石子，卤膏滓渣等掺入盐内，乘机混淆，捣乱市场，损害人民健康；再加土盐乘机发展，盐产互相冲销；东北盐越区入关，长芦盐侵销华东。基于以上情况，我们必须说服干部，教育群众，提高其政治觉悟，开展保场护税运动。
    四、坚决执行“公私兼运兼销”的运销方针。我们应加强运销工作的计划性，根据各地的交通条件人口分布及经济情况制订计划，调剂盈虚，保证供应。尽量减少中间剥削，作到减轻民负薄利多销。这些责任在产销分开地区（如华北、华东、中南），希望中国盐业公司普设分支机构结合合作社并吸收私商力量，争取胜利完成任务。至于产销尚未分工地区（如西北、西南），则由盐务机关，按照前述原则，坚决贯彻执行中央人民政府这一决定。
