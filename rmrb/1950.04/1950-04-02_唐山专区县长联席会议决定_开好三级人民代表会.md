　　Tangshan Special District County Heads' Joint Meeting Decides to Convene Good Three-Level People's Representative Conferences
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] In order to implement the provincial government's instructions regarding the village, district, and county three-level people's representative conferences and the three-level elections, the Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office of Hebei Province convened a joint meeting of county heads from Zunhua, Changli, Qianxi, Qian'an, Lulong, and five other counties on March 7th, and conducted specific research and discussions. The meeting decided: (1) The three-level representative conferences and the three-level election work must be regarded as a movement to mobilize, inspect, deploy, and strengthen production leadership, and implement production policies; election work should pay attention to not delaying production, and in addition to election meetings, more small meetings should be held in the evenings. (2) The tendency of closed-doorism among cadres must be resolved. (3) Preparatory committees for the village, district, and county three-level people's representative conferences should be established to carry out full preparatory work (including ideological and organizational preparation). Governments at all levels should cooperate with mass organizations, absorb people from all walks of life to participate, implement the spirit of consultation, and carry out all preparatory matters. The county should use the standing committee of the people's representative conference of all circles as a foundation, and additionally appoint several preparatory committee members to enhance the broadness of the preparatory committee. The preparatory committee will establish proposal collation, qualification review, and propaganda committees, and a secretariat, with clear divisions of labor, to carry out the following work: 1. Convene various meetings and use various forms such as blackboards and radio stations to widely and deeply publicize the importance of the three-level people's congresses and the three-level elections among the masses; 2. Fully consult and discuss to determine the number of representatives and the proportional distribution of the number of representatives from various regions, industries, and strata. 3. The government should prepare concise work reports and urgently solve the problems needed by the masses. The main tasks in the future are to plan production, especially spring plowing work, and to develop a combination of agricultural and sideline production for self-salvation. (4) Democracy must be fully promoted and problems must be effectively solved at the meeting. 1. During the preparation period, the presidium chairing the conference should discuss and consult with representatives from all walks of life more often; do not try to save trouble or be afraid of trouble, gather ideas and prevent it from becoming a formality. 2. Democracy must be highly promoted during the election: widely unite all strata, enlighten everyone to vote seriously, and launch mass-based election campaigns. The main conditions are to be able to lead production and be fair in handling affairs. 3. Humbly listen to the opinions of the representatives and review the implementation of government policies, laws, and resolutions. 4. After the establishment of the government committee, a certain meeting system should be established to play a leading role. (5) The majority of the existing village cadres are good in nature, but due to a lack of education and other reasons in the past, they have made mistakes such as being divorced from the masses. Therefore, the policy of striving for unity, transformation and education has been determined, with good village cadres as the foundation, and new people who are good at production, fair in handling affairs, and supported by the masses will be absorbed to participate. Those who have general problems in their work style can still be elected after education and correction; individual people with bad character, serious mistakes, and complaints from the masses should be dealt with by the government according to law. The above resolutions stipulate that they should be completed within two months from March 10th.
    In terms of working methods, the special zone has decided to focus on Changli County (with cadres from the special zone participating); to absorb experience and promote it throughout the region. Each county should also organize inspection work groups to promptly check and guide in order to exchange experiences.

　　唐山专区县长联席会议决定
    开好三级人民代表会
    【本报讯】为贯彻执行省府关于村区县三级人民代表大会与三级选举指示，河北省唐山专署于三月七日曾召开遵化、昌黎、迁西、迁安、卢龙等九县县长联席会议，具体作了研究讨论。会议决定：（一）必须把三级代表大会和三级选举工作，作为动员检查布置与加强生产领导、贯彻生产政策的运动；选举工作，要注意不耽误生产，除选举大会外，其他利用晚上多开小会。（二）必须解决干部中的关门主义思想倾向。（三）成立村区县三级人民代表大会的筹备委员会，进行充分的准备工作（包括思想与组织准备）。各级政府协同群众团体，吸收各界人士参加，贯彻协商精神，进行一切筹备事宜。县以各界人民代表会常务委员会为基础，增聘筹备委员若干人，以增强筹委会的广泛性。筹备委员会下设：提案整理、资格审查、宣传等委员会和秘书处，明确分工，进行如下工作：一、召开各种会议，利用黑板报、广播台等多种形式，在群众中广泛深入地宣传三级人代会和三级选举的重要意义；二、充分协商讨论，确定代表名额和各区域、行业、阶层的代表名额比例分配。三、政府要准备扼要的工作报告，迫切解决群众需要的问题。今后任务主要是计划生产，特别是春耕工作和开展农业副业结合生产自救。（四）会议上要充分发扬民主与切实解决问题。一、在筹备期间，主持大会的主席团要和各界代表多酝酿讨论协商；不要图省事、怕麻烦，集思广益防止流于形式。二、在选举时必须高度发扬民主：广泛团结各阶层，启发大家认真选举，发动群众性的竞选，条件主要是以能领导生产与办事公正为主。三、虚心听取代表们的意见，审查政府政策法令和决议贯彻程度。四、政府委员会成立后，要建立一定的会议制度，发挥领导作用。（五）现有村干部多数本质是好的，但由于过去缺乏教育等原因，而造成脱离群众等错误，因此，确定了争取团结，改造教育的方针，以好的村干部为基础，吸收生产好、办事公正、群众拥护的新人物参加。对一般作风有毛病的，经教育改正后仍可当选；个别品质太坏，错误严重，又经群众控告的，政府要依法处理。以上决议，规定自三月十日起，两月内完成。
    工作方法上，专区已决定以昌黎县为重点（专区派干部参加）；吸收经验，推广全区。各县亦要组织巡视工作组，及时检查指导，以便交流经验。
