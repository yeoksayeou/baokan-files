　　How Shandong Solves the Problem of Winter School Teachers

According to the experience of the past few years, the primary task of running winter schools is to solve the problem of teachers. Before the start of winter schools, Shandong and other regions first conduct democratic elections and training for winter school teachers. For example, as early as October 20th of last year, the Bohai District Administrative Office's Education Department issued the "Winter School Teacher Training Plan." Lu Zhongnan, Jiaodong and other districts also carefully studied and arranged the selection and training of winter school teachers and the issue of winter school teacher treatment in the preparation work for running winter schools. According to statistics from Lu Zhongnan and Bohai districts, a total of 21,000 winter school teachers were trained. Including Jiaodong District (where education is relatively developed) and the two directly administered special districts of Changwei and Zibo, the province has trained more than 40,000 winter school teachers. Many areas (such as Jiaodong and Lu Zhongnan) also employ many "little teachers" to teach winter schools. They have played a huge role in promoting winter school work.

Winter school teachers in various places are generally democratically elected by the masses based on the following conditions: (1) Have a considerable level of education (the specific requirements vary from place to place, generally requiring a primary school graduation level). (2) Enthusiastic about teaching, able to be proactive and responsible in running schools, and have a decent style. (3) Support the People's Government and the Communist Party and its policies. This year's selection of winter school teachers emphasized cultural conditions, correcting the previous phenomenon of particularly emphasizing political conditions and neglecting cultural conditions, which resulted in "attending winter school without learning to read."

The training of winter school teachers is mostly conducted in short-term training courses of five to ten days, organized by county (and some by district). The teaching content of the training courses mainly includes: (1) Current affairs and future education, and explanation of the great significance of running winter schools and the glory of being a mass teacher, in order to get through ideological obstacles and achieve serious school operation and teaching. (2) The principles and methods of winter schools. (3) Study of teaching materials (the Farmer's Cultural Textbook compiled by the Provincial Department of Education) and research on teaching methods.

In order to consolidate the morale of winter school teachers, various places have strengthened guidance and assistance to winter school teachers. Generally, winter school teachers have a low level of education (according to the education level of 306 teachers in Shanghe County: eight with junior high school degrees, 63 with higher primary school degrees, and the remaining 235 all with primary school degrees) and little teaching experience. Various places have adopted methods such as elementary school teachers or district and township cadres giving preparatory lessons to winter school teachers, and organizing winter school teachers to observe and visit classes to improve winter school teachers. In Lu Zhongnan District, elementary school teachers mostly provide guidance in central school districts. At the same time, winter school teacher meetings are held regularly to check their work and provide guidance and assistance. Some winter school teachers who have financial difficulties are assisted by mass discussions, or the class time is counted as work points (such as Licheng County stipulating that four days of class is equivalent to one work point), or they are exempted from labor services, or they are helped with farming and work. In addition, general political encouragement is given to winter school teachers, and attention is paid to enhancing the prestige of winter school teachers. These have played a role in consolidating winter schools and improving teaching effectiveness.

However, due to the small amount of social and educational funding, and the encounter with disasters and famines, the masses are living in poverty, so the issue of material treatment for winter school teachers has not been completely resolved in various places. This issue deserves attention, especially when winter schools are transformed into year-round people's schools. In addition, the content of the political textbooks for winter schools compiled in various places is relatively profound, which is beyond the ability of general winter school teachers. Political class teachers in winter schools are generally required to be district and township cadres and better village cadres and elementary school teachers. However, they are busy with central work and cannot fully prepare their lessons, and they inevitably miss classes due to business. This problem has not yet been properly resolved.

### 山东怎样解决冬学师资问题

　　山东怎样解决冬学师资问题
    根据几年来的经验，办冬学的首要工作是解决教师问题。山东各地在冬学开始前都首先进行民主选举和训练冬学教师。如渤海区早在去年十月二十日，行署教育处即发下“冬学教员集训方案”，鲁中南、胶东等区亦均在开办冬学的准备工作中，详细研究和布置了选拔训练冬学教师及冬学教师待遇问题。据鲁中南、渤海两区的统计，共训练了冬学教师两万一千名，加上胶东区（该区教育比较发达）与昌潍、淄博两个省直辖专区，全省经过训练的冬学教师约在四万人以上。还有不少地区（如胶东、鲁中南）还选用许多小先生教冬学。他们在冬学工作上起了极大的推动作用。
    各地冬学教师一般是根据下列几个条件经过群众民主选举产生的：（一）有相当的文化水平（具体要求各地不一，一般要求具有初小毕业程度）。（二）热心教学，办学能积极负责，作风正派。（三）拥护人民政府与共产党及其政策者。今年选拔冬学教师，重视了文化条件，纠正了以往特别强调政治条件而忽视文化条件，以致造成“上冬学不识字”的现象。
    冬学教师的训练，多以县（还有的以区）为单位分期开办五天至十天的短期训练班。训练班的教学内容，主要是：（一）时事前途教育，并说明办冬学的重大意义与作为群众教师的光荣，以打通思想，作到认真办学、教学。（二）冬学的方针、办法。（三）教材学习（省教育厅编的农民文化课本）和教学方法研究。
    为了巩固冬学教师的情绪，各地加强了对冬学教师的辅导帮助。一般冬学教师文化程度低（以商河县三○六个教师的文化程度统计：初中程度者八人，高小程度者六三人，其余二三五人全是初小程度），教学经验少。各地采取了由小学教员或区乡干部给冬学教师上预备课，并组织冬学教师互相观摩、参观上课等方式来提高冬学教师。鲁中南区多以中心学区为单位，由小学教师来进行辅导；同时，定期召开冬学教师会议，检查其工作，给以指导帮助。有些冬学教师生活困难，则由群众讨论予以资助，或将上课时间计工（如历城县规定每上课四天顶一个工），或免除其勤务，或替他代耕、帮工等。此外，一般的都作到了给冬学教师以政治的鼓励，注意提高冬学教师的威信。这些对巩固冬学与提高教学效果都起了作用。
    但是，由于社教经费少，又遇到灾荒，群众生活困难，以致对于冬学教师的物质待遇问题各地还未彻底解决，特别在冬学转为常年民校时，这一问题值得注意。此外，各地编的冬学政治教材内容较深，为一般冬学教师所不能胜任。冬学的政治课教员，一般规定由区乡干部和较好的村干部、小学教员担任。但他们忙于中心工作，不能充分准备功课，而且不免因事缺席。此一问题尚未得适当解决。
