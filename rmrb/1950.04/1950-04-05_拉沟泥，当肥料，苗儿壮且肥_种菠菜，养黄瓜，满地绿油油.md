　　Hauling ditch mud as fertilizer makes the seedlings strong and robust; planting spinach and growing cucumbers turns the land green.
　　Peking University was allocated a total of 115 mu of vegetable gardens, paddy fields, dry land, and ditch land in Tongshun Village, Longhe Village, in the southern suburbs. When it was taken over, six technicians were left behind, and two more workers were transferred from the school to be stationed there. The Department of Welfare plans to request a loan of 27,900 jin of millet from the Municipal Production Guidance Committee to purchase fertilizer, seeds, and tools.
　　The four mu vegetable garden has already been planted with spinach, small radishes, and Chinese cabbage. After harvesting, cucumbers and eggplants will be planted, followed by Chinese cabbage and scallions. Students participate in production mainly by undertaking shock tasks, such as thinning seedlings, pulling vegetables, transporting vegetables, picking cotton, harvesting rice, and carrying rice.

　　After holding a grand groundbreaking ceremony on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, the students of the production teams at Yenching University happily went to their land, ready to complete their tasks with a high degree of production enthusiasm.
　　The majority of students in the school participated in this production. The Department of Home Economics and the Department of Economics participated in full, and challenged other departments. The Department of Physics also mobilized ten faculty and staff members to participate together. A total of 599 students participated, accounting for 60 percent of the school's population. They were divided into five production units and forty-eight production teams. The school originally had forty pieces of farm equipment, and now the school has taken out a loan to purchase sixty more pieces, both large and small. In terms of fertilizer, cow manure from the school's dairy farm, pig manure from the pigsty, and mud dredged from the water pool can be self-supplied. In terms of water conservancy, each area has wells and pools, and there are water buckets and water-drawing frames to solve the problem. (New Yenching News)
　　Agricultural production at Beijing Normal University has made rapid progress. In the Erligou vegetable garden, students used their own hands to loosen the soil, sprinkle fertilizer, water it, and plant scallions, spinach, potatoes, and Swiss chard, etc., which have now grown into a lush green field of seedlings. The waterwheel in the garden has been installed. The students also cleaned up a rented house next to the vegetable garden to serve as accommodation for technicians and workers, as well as a place for students to rest.
　　Sowing work on campus has also been completed, including spinach, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, Chinese cabbage, and small red radishes. The students themselves used carts to haul sludge from the sewers on the street as fertilizer.
　　The sewing group of the sideline production has started work. It is voluntarily organized by female students with good sewing skills. They enthusiastically go to the garment bureau to learn various new styles, buy the best thread, and work carefully. They can now make Lenin suits, shirts, trousers, vests, jackets, skirts, and hats, priced at 70 percent of the market price. (Beijing Normal University Communications Group Zhou Tong)
　　The North China Secondary School Production Committee announced the budget, with total expenditure reaching 39,529 jin of millet, of which fertilizer alone requires 37,000 jin of millet. Therefore, the school proposed "resolutely finding our own way!" They organized students to carry ditch mud. In addition, workers take turns cleaning the toilets on campus, accumulating the waste, and then students use manure carts to transport it outside the city. In this way, the fertilizer problem is 7/8ths solved by themselves. (North China Secondary School Communications Group)
　　The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University and eleven other schools, including No. 6 Middle School and Zhonghua Middle School, have jointly obtained 220 mu of land in the southern suburbs. For the convenience of operation, they jointly organized a "Southern Suburbs Collective Farm," with representatives from each school forming a "Management Committee" to plan and arrange various tasks. In terms of equipment, the Management Committee plans to have three livestock, two waterwheels, and one cart, and has now applied for a loan from the government. In terms of fertilizer, it is planned to use as much manure from each school as possible. The soil tilling for the seventy mu of cotton will begin soon. (Affiliated High School Communications Group)
　　The Girls' High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University has dug a well in the fields outside the city. Spinach and water radishes were sown four days ago. The school has started production preparations since the winter vacation. They haul ditch mud with carts every day, having hauled more than 80,000 jin. They have also opened up a 2-mu area of ​​idle land in the dormitory as an "experimental farm" to cultivate seedlings.

　　Yu Ying Middle School's extracurricular production officially began on March 27. The Production Committee has organized the students participating in off-campus production into seven squadrons and twenty teams, and has formulated a "Production Covenant" to ensure that extracurricular production is carried out in an organized and disciplined manner. Since part of the 37 mu of public land allocated has spring wheat waiting to be harvested, it will not be possible to cultivate this week. In recent days, students have enthusiastically cultivated the arable land in the school's three courtyards and five courtyards. They plan to go to work on the public land outside Xizhimen starting next week. (Yu Ying Communications Group)

　　拉沟泥，当肥料，苗儿壮且肥  种菠菜，养黄瓜，满地绿油油
    北京大学在南郊龙河村同顺庄分配到菜园、稻田、旱地、沟地共一一五亩。接管时留下了技工六人，又由校内抽调工友二人，前往该地留驻。生活福利部近拟向本市生产指导委员会请贷小米二万七千九百斤，用来购买肥料、种籽和工具等。
    四亩菜园，现已种下了菠菜，小萝卜和小白菜，收起后再种黄瓜和茄子，最后是种大白菜和大葱。同学们参加生产，主要是担任突击任务，像?苗、拔菜、运菜、摘棉花、割稻、担稻等。（北大通讯组）
    燕京大学于上月二十七日下午举行了盛大的动土典礼后，各生产小组的同学都愉快地走上自己的土地，准备用高度的生产热诚来完成任务。
    全校大部同学都参加了这次生产。家政、经济系全体参加，并向各系挑战。物理系并发动了十位职员工友一齐参加。参加同学总数五百九十九人，占全校人数百分之六十。共分为五个生产单位，四十八个生产小组。该校农具原有四十件，现在又由学校贷款添购大小六十件。肥料方面，用该校牛奶场牛粪及猪圈猪粪及挖水池澜泥或可自给。水利方面，各地区都有水井水池，自有水桶，装水架子辘轳，可以解决。（新燕京报）
    北师的农业生产，已有很快的进展。在二里沟菜园，同学们用自己的手，把土翻松，洒上粪、浇上水、种上的葱、菠菜、土豆、根达菜等，现在已长成绿油油的一片菜苗。园里的水车已按装好。同学们并将菜园旁租到的一间房子收拾好，作为技工及变工的人住处及同学们休息的地方。
    校内生产播种工作也已完成，有菠菜、土豆、西红柿、蒜、小白菜、小红萝卜等。同学们自己用排子车到街上拉下水沟挖出来的污泥作为肥料。
    副业生产缝纫组已开始工作。是由女同学缝纫技术较好的自愿组织起来的。她们热心地到成衣局去学习各种新式样子，买最好的线，细心地作。现在能做列宁服、衬衫、长裤、背心、大褂、裙子和帽子，价钱按市价的百分之七十计算。                                      （北师通讯组周铜）
    华北中学生产委员会公布了预算，全部开支共达三万九千五百二十九斤小米，其中肥料一项就需要三万七千斤小米。因此，校方提出“坚决自己想办法！”组织同学们抬沟泥，此外，校内厕所由工友轮流掏，积存起来同学们再用粪车运到城外去。这样，肥料问题自己便解决了的八分之七。

    师大附中与六中、中华等十一校在南郊共分得土地二百二十亩，为了经营便利，共同组织成了“南郊集体农场”，由各校代表组成了“管理委员会”计划布置各种工作。在设备方面，管委会计划有三个牲口、二个水车、一个大车，现已向政府请求贷款。在肥料方面，计划尽量用各校粪便。七十亩棉花的翻土工作，最近就要开始。（附中通讯组）
    师大女附中在城外地里打了一口井。菠菜，水萝卜等已下种四天。该校自寒假以来，即开始了生产准备工作。他们天天用大车拉沟泥，已拉了八万余斤。并在宿舍的空闲地带开辟了二亩大小的土地，作为“实验农场”，培育苗种。

    育英中学课余生产自三月二十七日起正式展开。生产委员会已将参加校外生产的同学编成了七个中队、二十个小队；并且制订了“生产公约”，以保证有组织有纪律地把课余生产搞好。因所分得的三十七亩公地上有部分春麦待收，本周不可能耕作。连日同学们以高度热情垦植了校内三院、五院可耕空地。准备下周起即赴西直门外公地工作。
