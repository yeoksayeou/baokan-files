　　Exhibition Work of Cultural Centers in Various Counties of Yuci Prefecture
　　Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Huangfu Jin
　　In the past year, the cultural centers in various counties of the Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have all carried out exhibition work. According to statistics from ten counties including Zuoquan, Xiyang, and Heshun, as well as the Yangquan mining area, a total of fifty-four exhibitions were held. Each exhibition attracted thousands upon thousands of visitors. The content of the exhibitions fully met the needs of the masses, promoting central tasks and production movements.
    (1) In production exhibitions, scientific agricultural production technologies were introduced in a timely manner, and production models were praised. For example, Xiyang County used sand tables to explain the properties of various soils and the use of fertilizers; Shouyang County exhibited new-style farm tools created by labor heroes (capable of hoeing ten ridges of small seedlings); Xiyang also imitated models of tractors; and Yushe County even exhibited the exemplary deeds of labor hero Zhang Ziquan, thereby encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for improving technology and achieving prosperity through labor. When Zuoquan County experienced insect pests, the cultural center immediately collected twelve methods of pest control, and through cartoons, models, objects, experiments, and other means, conducted mobile exhibitions in rural areas, arousing the masses to automatically study methods of pest control and prevention. They said, "The People's Government is so good, providing us with methods that save money and are effective."
    (2) In health promotion, the most popular was the exhibition on maternal and infant health. They investigated the fact that the infant mortality rate increased in rural areas due to unsanitary delivery practices, and introduced methods of "how to raise children," made into models and comic strips, and invited doctors to explain. In Xiyang County, one exhibition lasted for five days, with 26,000 people visiting. Women from twenty miles away even rode donkeys to see it. When Zuoquan County exhibited maternal and infant health, four pregnant women from Houyaoyu Village came to visit specifically. The next morning, they ran to the cultural center again to ask, "How exactly do you cut the umbilical cord so that you don't have to worry about umbilical sepsis?"
    (3) Current affairs exhibitions played a significant role in publicizing the victorious situation, celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the signing of treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union. The clay sculpture "Chiang Bandit's Last Battle" in Heshun County attracted much attention from the masses, who pointed at Chiang Bandit in the coffin and cursed, "See how many days you can live!"
    In terms of exhibition methods, they have also explored several experiences:
    (1) It is necessary to organize publicity forces from all aspects, especially the assistance and cooperation of relevant departments. For example, for production exhibitions, agricultural farms or agricultural and forestry departments should be asked to provide materials and serve as explainers for the exhibitions. When Yushe County exhibited the exemplary deeds of labor hero Zhang Ziquan, they also invited him to speak about his production experience. The effect of a real person speaking about real events was greatest.
    (2) It is best to use temple fairs and other mass gatherings to hold exhibitions, combining them with publicity tools such as slides and storytelling with drums, and organizing local cultural and entertainment groups to cooperate. Unify the content of publicity to expand the publicity effect. Yushe County once combined a health exhibition with doctors from the county hospital providing medical treatment and vaccinations to the masses, promoting "Vaccinations make the body strong; one vaccination is worth a hundred supplements." After seeing the health exhibition, the masses broke away from the ideas of "not believing," "not being effective," and "being afraid of trouble" about vaccinations. At five temple fairs, a total of more than 1,600 people were vaccinated.
    (3) Models and cartoons should be larger and more prominent, and it is best to use the method of comparison. For example, the comparison between healthy and unsanitary families by the Heshun Cultural Center, and the comparison between soaked seed and unsoaked seed yields by Xiyang, attracted a lot of attention from the audience. It is best to build a shed in a wide place for the exhibition, with more entrances and exits. For indoor exhibitions, if the space is narrow, the overcrowding of visitors will reduce the effect of observation. The masses reflected, "The exhibition is good, but it's too crowded to see."
    (4) It is best to ask personnel from relevant departments (such as farms, hospitals, etc.) to serve as explainers. When explaining, it is necessary to see the audience clearly and try to inspire the masses to ask questions and discuss among themselves. Explainers should learn the language of the masses and use the words of the masses to explain. In this way, the masses are more likely to accept it.
    The exhibition work of the cultural centers in various counties has left a good impression on the masses. Therefore, when the Heshun Cultural Center exhibition team passed by Jiaohong Temple, the masses chased them back two miles to hold the exhibition. Under the influence of the exhibitions in the cultural centers, many villages have also started their own exhibitions. Dazhai Village in Yushe held a production exhibition after the autumn harvest, comparing the results of selected seeds and unselected seeds. The same land, two different yields. Some people regretted after seeing it and said, "I suffered a loss this year, but next year I must listen to the words of the higher authorities (government)!"

　　榆次专区各县文化馆的展览工作
    本报特约通讯员  皇甫瑾
    一年来，山西省榆次专区各县的文化馆，都进行了展览工作。据左权、昔阳、和顺等十县及阳泉矿区的统计，共展览了五十四次。每次展览，都有成千成万的观众。展览的内容，完全适合群众的需要，推动了中心工作和生产运动。
    （一）在生产展览上，及时地介绍了农业生产的科学技术，表扬了生产模范，如昔阳县用沙盘说明几种土壤的性质及肥料的使用；寿阳县展览了劳动英雄创造的新式农具（可锄十垅小苗）；昔阳还仿制了拖拉机的模型；榆社县更展览了劳动英雄张自全的模范事例，以此来鼓励群众改良技术和劳动致富的热情。左权县发生虫害的时候，文化馆立刻搜集了十二种杀虫的方法，通过漫画、模型、实物、实验等方式，到农村巡回展览。引起群众自动研究除虫防害的办法。他们说：“人民政府就是好，给咱想出的办法，又省钱，又顶事。”
    （二）在卫生宣传上，最受人欢迎的是妇婴卫生的展览。他们调查了农村因接生不卫生而致婴儿死亡率增大的事实，并介绍了“怎样养孩子”的方法，制成模型和连环画，并请医生作说明。昔阳县有一次展览会开了五天，参观的群众达二万六千人。二十里以外的妇女，还有骑着毛驴来看的。左权县展览妇婴卫生时，后窑峪四个怀孩子的妇女，特地来参观了一下。第二天一早，她们又跑到文化馆来问：“倒底怎样剪脐带，就不怕害脐风？”
    （三）时事展览，在宣传胜利形势与庆祝中华人民共和国的成立，以及中苏签订条约和协定等方面，起了很大的作用。和顺县的泥塑“蒋贼最后一战”，很使群众的注目，大家指着棺材里的蒋贼骂着说：“看你还能活几天！”
    在展览方法上，他们也摸索到了几点经验：
    （一）必须组织各方面的宣传力量，尤其是有关部门的协助与合作。如生产展览，就请农场或农林科等供给材料，并做展览会的说明员。榆社县展览劳动英雄张自全的模范事例时，还请他本人来讲生产经验，真人讲实事，作用最大。
    （二）展览最好利用庙会及其他群众集会的机会，结合幻灯、大鼓书等宣传工具，并组织当地的文化娱乐团体来配合。统一宣传内容，以扩大宣传效果。榆社县曾结合卫生展览，由县医院派医生给群众治病及打防疫针，宣传“打针身体壮，一壮抵百虚”。群众看了卫生展览，打破了对打针“不相信”、“不顶事”、“怕累事”的想法。在五个庙会上，共打防疫针一千六百多人。
    （三）模型和漫画，都要大一些和显明一些，最好是用对比的方法。如和顺文化馆的卫生与不卫生两个家庭的对比；昔阳浸种与不浸种两种收成的对比，很引起观众的注意。展览会最好在宽广的地方搭棚，出入口要多些。室内展览，地方窄狭了，参观者一拥挤，就减少了观摩的效果。群众反映说：“展览好是好，就是挤得看不见。”
    （四）说明员最好请各有关部门（如农场、医院等）人员来担任，说明时要看清对象，设法启发群众发问和自己来讨论。说明员要学会群众的语言，用群众的话来作解释。这样，群众更容易接受。
    各县文化馆的展览工作给群众留下了很好的印象。因此，和顺文化馆展览队路过焦红寺时，群众赶了二里地，把他们追回来给展览。在文化馆展览的影响下，许多村子也会自己开展览会了。榆社大寨村在秋后举行了一次生产展览，对比选种和不选种的结果。一样土地，两样收成。有的人看了后悔说：“今年吃了亏，明年可得好好听上边（政府）的话哩！”
