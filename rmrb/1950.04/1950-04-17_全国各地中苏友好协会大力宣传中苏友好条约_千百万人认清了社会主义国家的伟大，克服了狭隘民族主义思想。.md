Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Since the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters issued instructions in February calling on all local headquarters and branches to immediately launch celebrations and publicity for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, various localities have launched enthusiastic activities, which have now come to a close.

According to reports from various localities: The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a celebration rally of 100,000 people. The Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association co-organized a cocktail party with the Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Office to celebrate the new treaty. The Jiangxi Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a symposium of representatives from all walks of life and a symposium of cadres from the entire city of Nanchang. Other places, such as the Northeast, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, also held grand celebration meetings. In addition, in accordance with the instructions of the General Association, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various localities used various methods to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work on Sino-Soviet friendship. The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association led various districts in holding mass forums and organizing mass discussions. The Hebei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held lectures for street women and organized 23 propaganda teams in Ding County, attracting 80,000 listeners in two days. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces achieved universal publicity of the treaty in the cities. The Liaodong Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also organized a train propaganda group, organizing passenger forums and lectures 14 times on the Anshan-Shenyang railway line, with over 32,600 listeners. Many places also adopted the most accessible methods for the masses, such as ballads, shadow plays, and acrobatics, to carry out this publicity and education work.

Through this movement, the people of the whole country have greatly improved their understanding of the Soviet Union and shattered the rumors and slanders of the U.S.-Chiang clique. Initially, some incorrect views and narrow nationalistic ideas remained among some citizens and farmers, but after the influence of this publicity, many people's awareness has greatly improved. Many workers originally believed that the Soviet Union was good, but could not explain why. After listening to the publicity lectures, they became even clearer. A worker from a state-owned factory in Liaoxi said: "In the past, I didn't know what was good about the Soviet Union, I only knew that the Soviet Union was also led by the Communist Party. Now I understand that the Soviet Union is standing with us and helping us." Qin Yuyu, a worker at the Xinzhongguo Flour Mill in Baoding, said: "We must call on all workers across the country to use the machinery given to us by the Soviet Union carefully and protect it well, because it was earned by the Soviet working people with their blood and sweat." Employees and cadres of factories and enterprises in Shijiazhuang unanimously expressed that they would respond to the assistance of Soviet friends with practical actions of increasing production and practicing strict economy. Some intellectuals initially felt that the Soviet Union's help to China was too abstract only in spirit and theory. In this study movement, many such people clarified the problem. Many people understood the great significance of the Soviet Union's assistance to our country in all aspects, and at the same time realized that our Chinese people must rely on our own efforts to make good use of Soviet aid, and that our cooperation with the Soviet Union is equal and mutually beneficial, a true cooperation between fraternal countries. Many students from all over the country participated in the propaganda teams.

With the expansion and deepening of the influence of publicity and education, the local organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have also developed significantly. According to current materials: The Hebei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has developed 18 branch associations, 111 branch offices, and 51,304 members; each county in Hubei Province established preparatory committees for Friendship Associations in this movement and developed 50,000 members. Liaoxi Province developed 30,000 members, accounting for more than two-thirds of the original membership. The Beijing Friendship Association also grew from 160,000 members to 210,000.

　　全国各地中苏友好协会大力宣传中苏友好条约
    千百万人认清了社会主义国家的伟大，克服了狭隘民族主义思想。
    【新华社十四日讯】中苏友好协会总会自二月份发布了号召各地总分会、分会立即展开庆祝宣传中苏友好同盟互助条约的指示后，各地纷纷展开热烈活动，至今已告一段落。
    据各地报告：北京市中苏友好协会曾举行了十万人的庆祝大会，天津中苏友协曾与市府交际处合办庆祝新约的鸡尾酒会，江西省中苏友协举行了各界代表座谈会及南昌全市干部座谈会。其他各地如东北、江西、南京、上海、武汉、兰州等地也都举行了盛大的庆祝会。此外各地中苏友协并依照总会指示，运用各种方式，普遍、深入地进行了中苏友好的宣传教育工作。北京中苏友协领导各区举办群众座谈会，组织群众讨论；河北省中苏友协举行以街道妇女为对象的讲演会，在定县组织了二十三个宣传队，两天吸引听众八万人；辽西和辽东省中苏友协做到了在城市中普遍宣传条约；辽东省中苏友协并组织了列车宣传组，在安沈线火车上组织乘客座谈及讲演十四次，听众三万二千六百余人。许多地方还采用了最为群众所接近的方式如大鼓、洋片、杂耍等，进行这次宣传教育工作。
    通过这次运动，全国人民对苏联的认识大大提高了，并粉碎了美蒋的造谣诽谤。起先一部分市民和农民中还残存着某些不正确的观点及狭隘民族主义的思想，经过了这次宣传的影响，许多人觉悟提高不少。工人中许多是原来就相信苏联好，但是说不出理由来，听了宣传讲演后就更清楚了。辽西某国营工厂的一个工人说：“过去我不知道苏联好在那里，就知道苏联也是共产党领导的。现在可明白了，原来苏联是和咱们站在一边，帮助咱们的。”保定新中国面粉厂工人秦玉雨说：“我们要号召全国工人同志们，对苏联给我们的机械要小心使用，好好保护，因为这都是苏联劳动人民用血汗换来的。”石家庄工厂企业的职工、干部一致表示要以增加生产及厉行节约的实际行动回答苏联友人的帮助。个别知识分子最初觉得苏联只从精神上、理论上帮助中国似乎太抽象。这次学习运动中，不少这样的人把问题弄清楚了。许多人在这次运动中明白了苏联在各方面援助我国的重大意义，同时也认识到我们中国人民要自力更生，才能很好地使用苏联的援助，我们和苏联的合作是平等互利的，真正兄弟之邦的合作。各地许多学生都参加了宣传队。
    随着宣传教育影响的扩大与深入，中苏友好协会的地方组织也有了显著的发展。根据目前材料：河北省中苏友协发展了十八个支分会，一百一十一个支会，五万一千三百零四个会员；湖北省各县在这次运动中都建立起友协筹委会的组织，并发展会员五万人。辽西省发展了三万会员，占原有会员人数三分之二强。北京市友协也由十六万会员发展到二十一万。
