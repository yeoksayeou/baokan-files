　　County Leadership Disregards Farming Season, Spring Planting in Shulu Drifts Aimslessly
    Urgent Need to Immediately Grasp Leadership of Production
    Leadership of Production is the Overriding Central Task
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Reporter Lu Sheng reports: Spring planting production in Shulu County, Hebei Province, is currently still in a state of serious aimlessness. The main reason is that the county-level leadership is unclear about the idea of restoring and developing production as the overriding central task, and has not made leading production the top priority. Originally, at the county and district cadre meeting held at the end of February, the county-level leadership had already reviewed the shortcomings of neglecting the leadership of production, but when deploying work, they still took democratic political construction, reforming burdens, and tilling land on behalf of others as the central tasks. In order to create experience in these three tasks, the county specially transferred cadres to form three work groups, which went to key villages in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts respectively to create experience. District cadres who went to the villages also regarded these three tasks as shock work. As of March 19, except for a portion of waterwheels loaned out by the county, the entire county and district had very little leadership over spring planting production. They still know very little about what problems or concerns exist in the minds of the masses. On March 19, the Shulu County Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened another meeting of district chiefs and district party secretaries to discuss the shift of the central task and the lack of separation between the Party and the government. They still vaguely stipulated that production work is the current central task, and that each district should combine other tasks with production work as the center, but they still did not make specific arrangements for leading the current spring planting production. The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of the county are cotton-producing areas. The county only stipulated that this year's cotton production should be restored to the pre-war level (according to the county, cotton-producing land accounted for 80% of the total cultivated land before the War of Resistance Against Japan). As for how to achieve the pre-war level, the county-level leadership did not make specific arrangements. Therefore, the districts and villages still cannot estimate how much cotton can be planted this year. Individual villages have set plans, but they are still far from reaching the pre-war level. For example, Song Village in the third district plans to use 40% of the village's cultivated land to grow cotton, but it is still short of half the cotton seeds and cannot solve the problem. Li Village plans to strive to restore 50% of the pre-war cotton planting level, but the masses are still not actively cultivating the land. Individual village cadres and some of the masses gamble every night. The Third District Office has carried out gambling arrests for three consecutive nights, detaining gambling village cadres and the masses, but they still cannot stop it. The general public said, "It's still early to plant cotton, no hurry!" In fact, it is because there are concerns in their minds. However, the district cadres do not try to solve ideological problems, but simply arrest gamblers and detain people. When the districts conveyed the spirit of this district chief and district secretary meeting, most of them still did not emphasize the current focus on grasping leadership of production. Some districts (such as the third district) still announced that democratic political construction and reforming burdens are shock work. Therefore, when district cadres perform shock tasks, they often conflict with the production time of village cadres and farmers. When Yangjiazhuang Village in the third district held elections, only more than 100 people participated out of more than 400 households. Individual district cadres in the third district did not lead the masses in production, and the masses did not cook for them. After the meeting at the end of February, the work was generally more active than before, but when they encountered these situations, they lost confidence in their work, complained that the village cadres did not do their work, complained that the masses were backward, and asked the higher authorities to increase the number of district cadres. Although some district cadres feel the conflict between production and shock work, they have not actively put forward their opinions to the higher authorities. Therefore, spring planting in the county is still in a state of serious lack of leadership.

　　县级领导不顾农时突击其他工作
    束鹿春耕形成自流
    亟应立即抓紧领导生产
    领导生产是压倒一切的中心
    【本报讯】记者鲁生报导：河北省束鹿县春耕生产，目前仍处于严重的自流状态。主要原因是县级领导对恢复与发展生产为压倒一切的中心的思想不明确，没把领导生产作为第一位工作。本来二月底开的县区干部会上，县级领导已检讨了忽视领导生产的缺点，但在布置工作时，仍以民主建政、改造负担、代耕等工作作为中心。为创造这三个工作的经验，县里特抽调干部组成三个工作组，分别到四、五、六区选择重点村创造经验，各区干部到村，又把这三个工作作为突击工作。截至三月十九日，除县里贷出一部分水车外，整个县区对春耕生产领导甚少，有些区干部只统计一些群众送粪、耙地、打井的数字作为自己的工作成绩。目前农民思想中存在有什么问题或顾虑，仍很少知道。三月十九日，束鹿县政府和中共县委会，又召集各区区长、区委书记会，讨论转变中心工作和党政不分等问题，仍是笼统的规定了生产工作是当前的中心工作，各区应以生产工作为中心结合其他工作，但对领导当前春耕生产，仍未作具体布置。该县一、二、三、四、五区为产棉区，县里只规定了今年棉花生产要恢复战前水平（按该县产棉地在抗战前占总耕地面积百分之八十），至于怎样做才可达到战前水平，县级领导未作具体布置。因此各区村到目前还估计不出到底今年可种多少棉花。个别村定了计划，也距达到战前水平很远。如三区宋村计划用全村耕地百分之四十种棉，目前还缺一半棉籽没法解决，礼?村计划争取恢复战前植棉水平百分之五十，但目前群众仍未积极进行耕地。个别村干部和部分群众，每天夜间赌博，三区区公所曾接连三夜进行抓赌，把赌钱的村干部和群众扣起，也还制止不住。一般群众说：“现在种棉时间还早，不忙！”实际是因为思想中存在有顾虑。可是区干部并不设法去解决思想问题，却单纯抓赌扣人。各区传达这次区长区书会议时，多数仍未强调当前抓紧领导生产。有些区（如三区）仍宣布民主建政、改造负担是突击工作，因之区干部在执行突击任务时，常与村干、农民的生产时间发生矛盾。在三区杨家庄村选时，四百多户人家，只有一百多人参加选举。三区个别区干部因不领导群众生产，群众竟不给做饭吃。区干部经过二月底会议，工作一般较前积极，但遇到这些情况，对工作又没了信心，埋怨村干部不做工作，埋怨群众落后，要求上级增加区干部。有些区干部虽感到生产与突击工作的矛盾，亦未积极向上级提出意见。因而该县春耕仍处在严重的缺乏领导的状态中。
