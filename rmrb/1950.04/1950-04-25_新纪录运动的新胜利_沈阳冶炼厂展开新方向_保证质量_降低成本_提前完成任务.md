　　New Victory for the New Record Movement
    Shenyang Smelting Plant Embarks on a New Direction
    Guaranteeing Quality·Reducing Costs·Completing Tasks Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper News] Northeast Daily, 18th dispatch: The Shenyang Smelting Plant created eleven new records in various aspects in the first ten days of this month, pointing out a new direction for the New Record Movement. The first is to complete the production ahead of schedule under the condition of ensuring quality, thereby reducing costs. The converter shop of the smelting department completed 102% of the monthly plan by the 10th of this month, and also achieved significant results in various quotas. For example, the planned oil consumption per ton of crude copper was 110 kilograms, but the actual consumption was 103 kilograms (including mud furnaces). The labor quota was reduced by 35%. The quality also exceeded the plan, reaching 98.21% (the original plan was 98%). The direct cost per ton of copper was reduced by 2% compared with the plan; if compared with December last year, it was reduced by 50%. Secondly, new records for completing plans have emerged. For example, as of April 10, both crude copper and electrolytic copper had exceeded the entire task for the first half of 1950. Thirdly, technical personnel and workers closely combined and actively researched technology, and achieved many new achievements. For example, the electrolytic zinc test was successful. In the past, the zinc produced in China was crude zinc. During the puppet Manchukuo period, Japanese technical experts tried for many years, but the results all failed. After more than a year of experiments, the plant, with the joint efforts of technicians Chen Chuntai and Chen Jing and workers Wei Runshen and Sun Yunfeng, finally succeeded in the experiment, and electrolytic zinc production has now begun. Another example is Comrade Jiang Shaoxuan from the laboratory, who responded to the call of the higher authorities and studied the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the two rare elements selenium and tellurium. Through painstaking research, he gained experience in many failures and finally found an analysis method to determine the content of selenium and tellurium in anode mud and flue dust, laying a preliminary foundation for future extraction work. Another example is Comrade Wang Maochuan from the electrolysis department, who extracted metals and bismuth from the copper matte produced by the gold and silver reverberatory furnace. This metal has great uses in medicine and special alloys. At the same time, due to the research of technology, some conservative viewpoints have also been broken. For example, the bed capacity of the copper blast furnace in the smelting department (referring to the amount of ore melted per square meter of the blast furnace cross-sectional area in 24 hours) was previously considered to have reached the standard at 40 tons; but it has now reached 73.5 tons. The emergence of this new record has further encouraged the workers' confidence in learning technology. Fourthly, new records have also been created in construction. For example, in the construction of the recycled zinc oxide project, the repair department manufactured more than 350 meters of flue, more than 200 large and small funnels, and completed the installation 25 days ahead of schedule compared with outsourcing. In addition, six statisticians from the Planning Section's Statistics Unit, in addition to their daily business, draw more than 80 charts every day (submitted before 12 o'clock every day), showing the plant's work dynamics on the charts, which plays a significant role in the leadership's grasp of the situation. Currently, the plant, in addition to issuing notices throughout the plant to commend and award bonuses for the above new records, also provides the converter and copper ore smelting furnace construction workers with a rest room.

    Simultaneously with the publication of this news, the Northeast Daily published an editorial entitled "The New Direction of the New Record Movement." It pointed out: This achievement is a new victory for the plant's new record movement, and the experience of the Shenyang Smelting Plant also points out a new direction for the new record movement that is being carried out in the enterprises of the Northeast people. The editorial pointed out: The characteristic of this new direction is to complete the production plan ahead of schedule, improve quality, and reduce costs. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to mobilize technical personnel to go deep into the front line, combine scientific research with the labor creation of workers, and continuously improve and improve technology to continuously create various new records. The editorial pointed out: In order to encourage the production enthusiasm of the workers, point out the direction of efforts, and give timely rewards, is an important aspect of promoting the progress of the movement. The key to launching the new record movement lies in resolutely implementing management democratization, combining leadership and the masses, and transforming the administrative production plan into the production plan of the masses. Finally, the editorial called on all factories and mines to accept the new experience of the smelting plant and lead the new record movement to a new stage.

### 新纪录运动的新胜利  沈阳冶炼厂展开新方向  保证质量·降低成本·提前完成任务

　　新纪录运动的新胜利
    沈阳冶炼厂展开新方向
    保证质量·降低成本·提前完成任务
    【本报讯】东北日报十八日消息：沈阳冶炼厂于本月上旬又创出十一件各个方面的新纪录，给新纪录运动指出了一个新方向。首先是在保证质量条件下提前完成产量，从而降低了成本。该厂熔炼部真吹炉到本月十日完成全月计划的百分之一百零二，在各种定额上也有显著的成绩，例如每吨粗铜用油量计划是一百一十公斤，实际是一百零三公斤（并且包括泥炉在内）。人工的定额降低了百分之三十五。质量亦超过计划达到百分之九八·二一（原计划百分之九八）。在每吨铜直接成本上比计划降低了百分之二；若比起去年十二月则降低了百分之五十。其次，出现了完成计划的新纪录，如到四月十日止，粗铜与电铜均超过了一九五○年上半年全部任务。其三是技术人员与工人密切结合、积极钻研技术，获得了许多新的成就。如电解锌的试验成功，过去中国产出的锌都是粗锌，在伪满时日本技术专家虽试验多年，但结果都失败了；该厂经一年多试验，由于技术员陈春台、陈静和工人魏润身、孙云风等共同钻研，终于试验成功，现已开始电锌生产。另如化验室姜绍宣同志，响应上级号召，研究硒碲两种稀少原素的定性，定量分析。由于苦心钻研，在多次失败中取得了经验，终于找到了分析方法，确定了阳极泥及烟灰中硒、碲的含量，给以后提炼工作打下初步基础。再如电解部王懋钏同志，在金银反射炉产出的冰铜中提炼出金属、铋，这种金属在医药上，特殊合金中有很大用途。同时，因为研究技术，并打破了某些保守观点。如熔炼部铜鼓风炉的床能率（指鼓风炉的截面积每平方米在二十四小时熔解的矿石量），过去认为到四十吨已达到标准；但现已达到七三·五。这个新纪录的出现，是更加鼓舞了工人学习技术的信心。其四，在修建方面，也创造了新纪录。如修理部在修建回收氧化锌工程中，制造出三百五十多米的烟道，大小二百多漏斗，并较外包工提前二十五天按装完成。此外计划科统计股六名统计员，在日常业务外，每天画八十多张图表（每天十二点前提出），把全厂工作动态均表现在图表上，对领导上掌握情况起很大作用。现该厂对以上新纪录，除通报全厂表扬、给予奖金等外，并给真吹炉与铜熔矿炉修建工友休息室一座。
    与发表这个消息同时，东北日报以“新纪录运动的新方向”为题，发表社论。指出：这种成绩是该厂生产新纪录运动的新胜利，沈阳冶炼厂的经验，也给东北人民企业中正在开展着的新纪录运动展开了一个新的方向。社论指出：这个新方向的特点，就是提前完成生产计划，提高质量、降低成本。要达到这个目的，必须发动技术人员深入现场，使科学研究与工人的劳动创造相结合，不断的改进与提高技术，连续创造各种新纪录。社论指出：为鼓舞工人的生产热情，指出努力方向，及时给予奖励，是推动运动前进的一个重要方面。而创造新纪录运动开展的关键，则在于坚决实行管理民主化，使领导和群众相结合，把行政的生产计划变为群众的生产计划。最后，社论号召各厂矿接受冶炼厂的新经验，把新纪录运动引向新的阶段。
