　　Nankou Station Implements Joint Labor Groups
    Freight Car Turnaround Time Reduced by Two-Thirds
    Saving Over 55,000 Jin of Millet in Nineteen Days
    [Report from this newspaper] Nankou Station of the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, by implementing joint labor groups and adhering to a high degree of responsibility, reduced freight car turnaround time from the previous 30 minutes to under 10 minutes in the 19 days from March 9th to March 28th. On March 12th, freight train No. 762 even set a new turnaround record of 2 minutes and 51 seconds. As a result of enhanced transportation efficiency, a total of 55,460 jin of millet were saved in 19 days. The reasons for achieving the above results are mainly due to the leadership establishing a firm belief in implementing joint labor groups, overcoming departmentalism among cadres; and among the staff, promoting the spirit of collective wisdom, exchanging experiences, and providing new operating methods: resolutely implementing call and response, cooperating with each other, and closely combining arrival, dispatch, and inspection. The most typical example is: on March 12th, before freight train No. 762 arrived at the station, it contacted the dispatching office and the locomotive depot. The locomotive was dispatched from the depot in advance, and the transportation department assembled the A train carriages and implemented inspection and air brake testing. After the B train arrived, only 2 minutes and 51 seconds were used to complete all operations such as coupling four carriages, replacing brake shoes and pipes, creating a new turnaround record for freight cars. From March 9th to March 28th, a total of 66 freight trains were dispatched, and 7 late passenger and freight trains were dispatched within 5 minutes. With an average of 25 carriages per train, the average turnaround time for all freight cars was 20 minutes earlier than before, saving a total of 55,460 jin of millet.

　　南口站贯彻联合劳动组
    货车中转时间缩短三分之二
    十九天节省米五万五千余斤
    【本报讯】天津铁路局张家口分局南口站，实行联合劳动组，贯彻高度负责制，由三月九日至二十八日的十九天中，货车中转时间由以往的三十分钟降为十分钟以下；三月十二日，七六二次货车并创造了二分五十一秒的最高中转新纪录。由于加强运输效率的结果，十九天共节省小米五万五千四百六十斤小米。获得上述成绩的原因，主要是由于领导思想上树立了坚决贯彻联合劳动组的信念，克服了干部中的本位主义；在职工中则发扬了集思广益的精神，互相交流经验，提供了新的作业方法：坚决执行呼唤应答，互相配合，做到随到、随调、随查密切结合。最典型的例子是：三月十二日，七六二次货车在未到站前，即与调度所、机务段联系，机车提前出库，运转方面即将甲列车辆组成，并实施了检车、试风，待乙列车到达后，仅以二分五十一秒的时间，完成了挂车四辆，换闸瓦及管子等全部作业，创造了货车最高中转新纪录。三月九日到二十八日共开出货车六十六列，晚点客货列车于五分钟内开出者七列，每列平均以二十五辆计，全部货车中转时间平均较前提前二十分钟，共可节约米五万五千四百六十斤。
