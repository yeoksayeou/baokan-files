Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De inspected a cavalry division transferred from the Central South Front to the Northeast for garrison and production in the suburbs of Beijing at 1:00 PM today, and spoke to all officers and soldiers of the division. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: The comrades of the cavalry division participated in the People's Liberation War that defeated the Kuomintang bandits and achieved national victory, and have made great contributions to the country. Now they have been transferred back to the Northeast to garrison and produce, to establish large state-owned farms cultivated by machines for the country and the people, and at the same time to establish large horse farms, so that our cavalry forces will have good horses in the future. This is one of the glorious tasks of building a new China. Commander-in-Chief Zhu then encouraged all officers and soldiers not to be arrogant because of victory, to be ready at any time to fight against imperialist aggression, and to work hard to build our new modern army, navy, air force, and cavalry, artillery, and tank forces, and to build our new China. It is reported that the cavalry division participated in the liberation of the Northeast and the Pingjin campaigns, and went south to the Central South region last year to eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang, and recently received orders to return to the Northeast for garrison and production.
