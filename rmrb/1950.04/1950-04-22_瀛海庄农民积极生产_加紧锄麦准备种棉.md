　　Yinghai Village Peasants Actively Produce
    Hastening Weeding of Wheat and Preparing to Plant Cotton

    [Report from this newspaper] Peasants in Yinghai Village, District 14, near Beijing, are in high spirits for production since the land reform. Recently, the district's production work team successively convened meetings of party member cadres, farmers' association committees, and mass meetings, gathered opinions from the masses, and formulated a production plan to increase production by 20% (equivalent to 260,000 catties of corn).

    Last year, the village planted only 2,000 mu of wheat. This year, the village planted as much as 5,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 38% of the total land in the village. In order to ensure increased production and avoid damage to wheat seedlings from alkaline soil, the peasants raked the alkaline soil in the wheat furrows onto their backs. The entire village's wheat fields have been raked once. For autumn crops, which were usually weeded only twice in the past, this year they will be weeded at least three times. This year, the village plans to plant 2,424 mu of cotton, 1,324 mu more than last year. Each mu of cotton can produce 100 catties more corn than ordinary crops. Converting to cotton planting can increase corn production by 132,400 catties. The government has already provided a loan of 19,000 catties of cotton seeds. In order to complete this production plan, the women in the village are also preparing to participate in agricultural production. In addition to deep plowing and careful cultivation, the peasants are also repairing canals to prevent waterlogging and mobilizing landlords and loafers to participate in production. In the past, there were 24 landlords and loafers in the village who did not work, but now they have started working. Because some rich peasants are afraid of a "second land reform" and are afraid that workers will demand wage increases, they dare not hire workers. After the members of the village production guidance committee went to explain the policies to the rich peasants, the rich peasants' concerns were eliminated. Eleven hired workers in the village have started working and producing. Three peasant households in the village have jointly bought an ox, and nine more households are preparing to buy livestock together. There were originally six mutual aid teams and seven small work-exchange groups. Now there are a total of eighteen labor mutual aid groups.

　　瀛海庄农民积极生产
    加紧锄麦准备种棉
    【本报讯】京郊十四区瀛海庄农民，自土地改革后，生产情绪极高，近由该区生产工作组先后召集党员干部会、农会委员会以及群众大会，汇集群众意见，订出了增产二成（折合玉米二十六万斤）的生产计划。
    该村去年种麦仅两千亩，今年种麦即达五千亩，占全村土地总数的百分之三十八，农民为了保证增产，避免碱地损伤麦苗，把麦垅里的碱土耧到背上去，全村麦地已经普遍耧了一遍，大秋作物，往年一般的只锄两遍，今年至少要锄三遍。今年全村计划种棉两千四百二十四亩，较去年多种一千三百二十四亩。按每亩棉较普通庄稼可多产玉米百斤。改种棉花共可增产玉米十三万二千四百斤。现已由政府贷给棉籽一万九千斤。为了完成这一生产计划，村里妇女们也准备参加到农业生产中来。农民们除深耕细作外，还修渠防涝，发动地主二流子参加生产，过去全村有二十四个不干活的地主二流子，现在已经干起活来。因为还有部分富农怕“二次土改”，又怕工人要求增资，不敢雇工，经过该村生产指导委员会委员分头去给富农讲政策，富农顾虑消除，全村已有十一个雇工上工生产。村里已有三户农民伙买了一头牛，还有九户准备合伙买牲口，原有六个合犋互助组和七个小型变工组，现共增加到十八个劳动互助组。
