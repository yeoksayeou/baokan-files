　　Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Visiting Group Visits Mongolian and Tibetan Academy and Other Schools
　　[Our Newspaper] The Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Visiting Group visited the National Mongolian and Tibetan Academy at 1:00 PM on the 1st. All teachers and students of the school gathered to welcome them. Principal Huang Jingtao said in his welcoming speech: "The Mongolian and Tibetan school is no longer a beggar's shop, and is no longer looked down upon. On the contrary, it has received strong support from the government and respect from all walks of life. These facts show that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our ethnic minorities stand up." Then, several people, including the chairman of the student union and the representative of the Youth League, spoke and presented gifts such as the supreme Hada in Mongolian customs to the visiting group. A representative of the Mongolian ethnic group from Yili, Xinjiang, said: "The Mongolian ethnic group in Xinjiang has always been oppressed! In terms of culture, there was not a single school in the past, but since liberation, twelve primary schools have been established, and preparations are being made to establish a middle school." The Tibetan representative then also spoke, unanimously believing that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can ethnic minorities have happiness. Subsequently, the visiting group and the school performed Mongolian dance, Tibetan dance, and ethnic folk songs.

　　西北各族青年、妇女参观团参观蒙藏学院等校
    【本报讯】西北各族青年、妇女参观团于一日下午一时参观国立蒙藏学院。全校师生集会欢迎。黄静涛校长在致欢迎词时说：“蒙藏学校再也不是乞丐店，再也不受人轻视了。相反地受到了政府大力帮助和各界的尊重。由这些事实可以看出：只有在共产党的领导下，我们少数民族才能站起来。”继由学生会主席和青年团代表等数人讲话，并向参观团献了蒙古风俗习惯上至上的哈哒等礼物。新疆伊犁蒙古族代表讲话时说：“新疆蒙古族一向是被压迫的！拿文化来说，过去就没有一个学校，但是解放后到现在，却已经成立了十二个小学校，还准备成立一个中学。”藏族代表随后也讲了话，一致认为只有在毛主席领导下，才有少数民族的幸福。随后由参观团和该校表演了蒙古舞、西藏舞及各族民歌。
