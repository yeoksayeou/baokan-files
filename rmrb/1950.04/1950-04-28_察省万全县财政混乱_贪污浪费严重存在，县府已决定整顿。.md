　　Financial Chaos in Wanquan County, Chahar Province
    Embezzlement and Waste are Serious; County Government Determined to Rectify.
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to the Chahar Daily of April 18th, various financial expenditures in Wanquan County have long been chaotic, with embezzlement and waste being particularly serious. Since the Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," the county party committee and government have instructed cadres in all departments to study hard. A cadre training class was held in early March. In early April, a meeting of financial assistants from various districts was convened, at which the financial expenditures and ideological situation of the villages were examined. It was found that embezzlement and waste by village cadres were serious. Cadres of Donghongmiao Village collectively embezzled two bolts of cloth from the market and used 40 *shi* of millet allocated as public grain to cook communal meals. In Dutan Village, 10 *shi* of rice were wasted on opera performances for the New Year. Liu Yuxin and other 20-odd village cadres in Xihongmiao embezzled as much as 120 *shi* of rice (Liu Yuxin has been detained by the government). According to incomplete statistics, embezzlement and waste by village cadres throughout the county amounted to more than 146,000 *jin* of millet. In addition, the phenomenon of failing to adhere to regulations, embezzlement, and waste in the financial expenditures of county and district agencies also exists seriously. For example, the Public Security Team received ten extra sets of cotton clothing last year and was drawing pay for two "ghost" employees. Yan Jun of the First District, without requesting instructions, privately had a carpenter tear down two public houses to build a granary. The accounts of the supply and marketing cooperative, the finance section, and various agencies are not very clear. The main reasons for these phenomena are that the leadership has not clearly implemented the financial expenditure policy and has not mobilized the masses to supervise. In order to quickly overcome this phenomenon, the county government has decided on the following measures: 1. Strengthen the education of financial cadres, study professional skills, improve policy understanding, clarify responsibilities, and, in conjunction with other departments, implement the unified revenue and expenditure policy for village finances, and mobilize the masses to supervise financial expenditures. 2. Establish a complete set of financial systems from the county to the village, implement strict management, and establish a financial audit committee. In the future, accounts should be cleared daily. Those who violate the system will be dealt with according to law. 3. Immediately begin to audit village finances. For those who embezzle public funds for personal gain, the main approach will be education and reform, while those who commit major embezzlement will be dealt with according to law. 4. County and district cadres who eat, drink, embezzle, waste, or extort from the people in the villages must find ways to compensate. 5. All districts should conduct a general inventory of warehouses, and all materials should be reported in a unified manner. Start auditing the outstanding old public grain debts, reduce or exempt them according to the circumstances, and strive to complete the audit by the end of April.

　　察省万全县财政混乱
    贪污浪费严重存在，县府已决定整顿。
    【本报讯】据四月十八日察哈尔日报消息：万全县各种财政开支，长期存在着混乱现象，尤以贪污浪费为严重。自政务院发布统一国家财经工作决定后，该县县委和政府即指示各部门干部必需很好学习，三月初曾举办了干部训练班。四月初又召开了各区财政助理员会议，会上检查了村财政开支及思想情况。发现村干部贪污浪费现象严重。东红庙村干部集体贪污市布两匹，摊派小米四十石开了大锅饭。杜谭庄过年唱戏浪费米十石。西红庙刘玉鑫等二十余名村干部贪污米达一百二十石（刘玉鑫已由政府扣押）。据不完全统计，全县村干部的贪污、浪费即达小米十四万六千多斤，此外，县、区各机关财政开支上不坚持制度、贪污、浪费现象也严重存在，如公安队去年多领棉衣十套，吃两个人的“空名”。一区阎俊不请示私自让木匠拆掉两间公房修建粮库。供销社、财政科及各机关的账目都不太清楚。发生这些现象的主要原因是领导上没有明确贯彻财政开支政策，更没有发动群众起来监督。为迅速克服这种现象，县政府决定如下办法：一、加强财政干部教育，学习业务，提高政策水平，明确职责，与其他部门结合起来贯彻村财政统一筹支政策，发动群众监督财政开支。二、自县到村树立一套完整的财政制度，实行严格管理，建立清理财政委员会，今后做到每日账每日清，如有违犯制度者，依法处理。三、立即着手清理村财政，贪污自肥分子，主要采取教育改造方针，重大贪污者依法处理。四、县、区干部在村吃喝、贪污、浪费、向人民索取的，定要设法补偿。五、各区普遍清理仓库，一切物资统一上报。着手清理旧公粮尾欠，按情况减征或免征，争取四月底清理完毕。
