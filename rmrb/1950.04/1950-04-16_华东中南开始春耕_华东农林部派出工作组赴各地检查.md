　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 15th: Spring plowing has generally begun throughout East China. In order to better promote and guide the smooth completion of spring plowing work in the entire region, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee dispatched nine spring plowing work groups on the 5th of this month to Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Zhejiang, and other places. They will understand the leadership and implementation of spring plowing work by governments at all levels, as well as the difficulties and experiences currently existing in spring plowing. In the old liberated areas, the spring plowing work groups will focus on investigating the organization of farmers' labor force and farming techniques; in the new liberated areas, they will focus on investigating the organizational leadership of spring plowing and the farmers' production enthusiasm; in the disaster areas, they will focus on the combination of spring plowing with production-based disaster relief and water conservancy construction, as well as how to overcome the difficulties of production materials.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 15th: The preparation work for spring plowing in the vast rural areas of Central South China is nearing completion, and spring plowing has already begun in many areas. Since the beginning of spring, under the leadership of the people's government, farmers in various parts of Central South China have added a large number of cattle and farm implements and accumulated a lot of fertilizer to prepare for spring plowing. In Baofeng, Xiangcheng, Ye County, and other counties in Henan Province where land reform has been completed, the enthusiasm of farmers for production is extremely high, and the preparation for spring plowing was completed earlier. Generally, farmers have applied one more cart of manure per mu than in previous years. Farmers in Jia County have added more than 1,400 cattle this spring. Because the above counties have more wheat fields and less spring land, the spring plowing work has been completed, one month ahead of the farming season in previous years. In the Changsha Special District of Hunan Province, a total of 2,400 ponds and dams have been built, and 803 lime kilns have been restored, producing 30 million catties of lime fertilizer per month. Farmers in the riverine areas of Hubei Province are repairing ponds, weirs, and canals. Most farmers soaked rice seeds around Qingming Festival, preparing to transplant seedlings immediately after spring plowing. Farmers in the northern mountainous areas of the province are actively hoeing wheat, delivering manure, and starting spring plowing and autumn planting.
    During the preparation work for spring plowing, the local people's governments successively convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life to publicize production policies, dispel farmers' production concerns, and strengthen organizational leadership, listing the preparation work for spring plowing as one of the central tasks of rural work. At the same time, under the leadership of the people's governments in various places, the broad masses of farmers launched a large-scale rent reduction campaign, and the difficulties of farmers' living and production materials have been initially resolved. According to statistics from Hubei Province, farmers have recovered 150 million catties of grain due to rent reduction. In Yiyang Special District of Hunan alone, rent reduction and clearing of accumulated grain from charity granaries amounted to more than 90,000 dan. At the same time, the provincial people's governments have also universally issued agricultural loans. Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces have issued a total of 28.8 million catties of agricultural loan grain. Guangdong Province has lent 7.5 billion yuan in Renminbi. Henan has also lent high-quality cotton seeds, hemp seeds, and rice seeds to promote special crops and improve varieties. The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Office is also preparing to help farmers solve the difficulties of agricultural tools. Various places have also paid attention to the spring plowing work in the disaster areas. For example, in Baichi District and Huangpu District of Shangcai County, Henan Province, farmers affected by the disaster were unable to cultivate more than 30,000 mu of spring land. The local people's government organized manpower and animal power for exchange labor and mutual assistance based on the specific conditions of each township, and mobilized 1,000 cattle and 500 plows from non-disaster areas to assist in cultivation.

　　华东中南开始春耕
    华东农林部派出工作组赴各地检查
    【新华社上海十五日电】华东各地春耕已普遍开始。华东军政委员会农林部为更好地推动与指导全区顺利完成春耕工作，特于本月五日派出九个春耕工作组，分赴山东、苏北、苏南、皖南、皖北、浙江等地，了解各级人民政府对春耕工作的领导与执行程度及目前春耕中存在的困难及经验。春耕工作组在老区将着重调查农民劳动力的组织及耕作技术；在新区着重调查春耕的组织领导和农民生产情绪；在灾区则以春耕与生产救灾、兴修水利的结合及如何克服生产资料的困难等，作为调查重点。
    【新华社汉口十五日电】中南区广大农村的春耕准备工作即将完成，有不少地区且已开始进行春耕。入春以来，中南区各地农民在人民政府领导下，添置了大批的耕牛、农具，积蓄了很多肥料，准备春耕。河南省土地改革已经完成的宝丰、襄城、叶县等县，农民生产情绪极高，春耕准备工作完成较早，一般农民都较往年每亩增施粪一车。郏县农民在今春已添买耕牛一千四百余头。由于上述各县麦地较多，春地少，现春耕工作已完成，较往年耕作季节提前一月。湖南省长沙专区共兴修塘、坝达二千四百处，恢复石灰窑已达八○三个，月产石灰肥料三千万斤。湖北省沿江河地区农民，正进行整修塘、堰、水渠，大部农民在清明前后即浸了谷种，准备于春耕后立即插秧。该省北部山地农民正积极进行锄麦、送粪，着手进行春耕秋种。
    在春耕准备工作进行时，各地人民政府曾先后召开了各界人民代表会议，宣传生产政策，解除农民生产顾虑，并加强了组织领导，将春耕准备工作列为农村工作的中心任务之一。同时，广大农民并在各地人民政府领导下，展开了大规模的减租运动，农民生活资料与生产资料的困难已得到初步解决。据湖北省统计，农民因减租而收回粮食达一亿五千万斤。湖南仅益阳专区减租与清理义仓积谷即达九万余石。与此同时，各省人民政府并普遍发放了农贷。江西、湖南、湖北等省共已发放农贷粮二千八百八十万斤，广东省贷出人民币七十五亿元，河南并贷发了优良棉种、麻种、稻谷种，以推广特种作物与改良品种。湖北省农垦处并准备帮助农民解决农具困难。各地并同时注意了灾区的春耕工作，如河南上蔡县百尺区黄浦区受灾农民无力耕种三万余亩春地，当地人民政府即依据各乡具体情况，组织人力、畜力换工互助，并动员非灾区一千头耕牛、五百张犁前往助耕。
