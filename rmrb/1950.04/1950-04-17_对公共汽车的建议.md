To the Editor:

　　Since the introduction of public buses, they have greatly increased the convenience of transportation in the city. With a large number of vehicles, ample capacity, and comfortable seating, most passengers are satisfied. I have heard that the company plans to increase the number of vehicles and expand routes, which is indeed a major event in the municipal construction of Beijing. To further improve this undertaking, I would like to offer a few suggestions for relevant parties to consider:

　　I. Pay attention to cleanliness inside the bus. Sometimes it is clean, but sometimes it is full of dust, especially under the seats and at the front and rear of the bus. When the bus starts, dust always flies around due to the influx of outside air, making passengers uncomfortable.

　　II. It is hoped that drivers will avoid chatting with people while driving. Because they cannot concentrate on both things at the same time, it is easy to cause accidents. Once, I saw a driver chatting with a child, and although no accident occurred, the driving speed was much slower. It took twenty-one minutes to go from Qianmen to Gulou, which invisibly reduced transportation efficiency.

　　III. Passengers smoking inside the bus are sometimes not stopped, and sometimes the driver smokes while driving, which is detrimental to passengers' breathing and may also cause a fire hazard. It is best to post a "No Smoking" sign in a conspicuous place inside the bus to strengthen everyone's attention.

　　IV. When driving on crowded streets, accidents occasionally occur. If one bus cannot move, and passengers have to transfer to another bus, the second bus should start immediately after the transfer is complete, and the driver should not get out of the bus to watch the excitement, which would delay passengers' time.

　　V. Service personnel should take more care of women and children. Elderly women, or those with young children, have difficulty standing when they get on the bus, and some are unstable due to small feet. They can manage when the bus is going straight, but they sway from side to side when turning. If no passengers offer their seats, the service personnel should help them find a place to sit, and politely ask the young and middle-aged passengers sitting to give up their seats, which may solve the problem.

　　VI. It is hoped that monthly or semi-monthly passes can be sold so that office workers who take the bus for a long time can budget their expenses.

### 对公共汽车的建议

　　对公共汽车的建议编辑同志：
    公共汽车行驶以来，对本市交通增加了极大便利，由于车辆多、容量大、座位舒适，一般乘客无不满意。听说公司方面更有增加车辆、扩充路线的计划，这实在是京市市政建设中的一件大事。为了进一步改善这一事业，我提出几点意见，供有关方面参考。
    一、要注意车内清洁。有时候是干净的，有时候则灰尘满座，尤其是座位下面和车身前后端。开起车来，由于车外空气的冲入，总是尘土飞扬，使乘客感不到适。
    二、希望司机员在开车时避免与人闲谈。因为一时精神不能兼顾，容易发生撞车轧人的危险。有一次，我看见司机员一直与一个小孩闲谈，虽然没有发生事故，但行车速率却慢了许多，由前门至鼓楼共走了二十一分钟，无形中减低了运输效力。
    三、乘客在车内吸烟，有时不加制止，有时司机员也边开边抽，这有碍于乘客呼吸，还可能发生着火危险。最好在车内显明处标示一个“请勿吸烟”的牌子，加强大家的注意。
    四、在行人拥挤的街道上行驶，偶尔发生事故，甲车不能行车，等乙车来到乘客换乘完了时，乙车应立即开车，不要下车看热闹，耽误乘客时间。
    五、服务员要多照顾妇孺。老年妇女，或抱有小孩子的上了车，有的更因为脚小站不稳，又无空座，在直行时尚能支持，到拐弯时东倒西歪。若无乘客自动让座，服务员最好替他们安置一下，对坐着的青壮年乘客客气一下，就可能解决的。
    六、希望能够发卖定期月票或半月票，使长期搭公共汽车的机关工作者，能够预算自己的开支。
