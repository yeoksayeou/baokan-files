　　The Foundation of the Party Organization of the 70th Arsenal
    (Report Two)
    By Our Reporter Shang Kai

    For the past year, the production of the 70th Arsenal in Beijing has failed to achieve satisfactory results, and many urgent problems remain to be solved. One of the fundamental reasons is that the work of the General Branch Committee of the CPC in the factory has not been oriented towards production.

    However, what is the foundation of the Party in the 70th Arsenal, and what role have Party members and Youth League members played in production? To address this issue, the reporter revisited the factory and found that the entire factory contains a tremendous force. Although this force has not been utilized and developed for a long time, it has been erupting like sparks in various workshops and teams. One hundred and seventy Communist Party members and two hundred Youth League members are full of labor enthusiasm, hoping to improve production.

    In 1946, the underground Party organization of the 70th Arsenal was established, gradually developing from one or two people to more than a dozen. Under the terrorist rule of the Kuomintang bandits, they struggled hard and persisted until the eve of Beijing's liberation last January. Before liberation, they also bravely organized workers to protect the factory. During the first "May Day" after liberation, the factory launched a production competition, and Party member workers participated in the movement with unparalleled enthusiasm, achieving remarkable results.

    New Party Members Lack Experience and Urgently Need Help and Education

    The Party organization was made public last July, and a large-scale development began in September. By the end of February this year, the number of Party members had reached 168, accounting for about 10% of all employees. More than 80% of them are skilled workers, and many foremen and team leaders who directly control production are Communist Party members. They have relatively close ties with the masses. More than 70% of the Party members are new members, with little Party education and low political awareness. They have enthusiasm for work, but lack methods. They understand that Party members should unite the masses for active production, but they do not know how to unite the masses, lead the masses, solve problems for the masses, explain the Party's policies, raise the awareness of the masses, and mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses. The masses raise many questions to Party members, such as the Sino-Soviet Treaty, year-end bonuses, and victory bonds, but Party members rarely give explanations, so Party members do not have high prestige among the masses. However, in general, they can play an exemplary role in production. For example, when the Sixth Division called on everyone to set personal production plans, Party and Youth League members took the lead in drafting them, read them out at the meeting, and guaranteed to complete the tasks resolutely. Party member Wang Mingzhu led a group of workers who originally planned to make 45 chuck jaws per day. Later, they quickly reached a record of 66 pieces per day and guaranteed that they met the specifications. Party member Zhang Delin and Youth League members, who returned from the cadre training class, studied and improved the tools, and the production efficiency was 60% higher than when using the original tools. Most of the people who wash their hands and leave the factory last after work are Communist Party members and Youth League members. If Party members are good at uniting the masses, the role they play will be even greater. For example, in the Sixth Division, the cooperation between the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League is relatively good. When a production task comes or a problem occurs in production, everyone gets together to study and solve it in a timely manner. In the Seventh Division, production is based on a group or several groups as a production unit, jointly producing a large product, so the active role played by Party members can easily lead the masses and improve production efficiency. In November last year, the division worked three hours of overtime per person per day and produced four sets of water pumps. By December, not only was there no need for overtime, but one more set of water pumps was produced.

    Workers Care for and Love the Party and Demand More of Party Members

    Although the prestige of ordinary Party members among the masses is not high, the workers unanimously love the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, they are more strict in their requirements and supervision of Communist Party members. Some workers are willing to join the Communist Party, but they also consider that their production enthusiasm is not high and does not meet the requirements of a Communist Party member, so they have not applied to join the Party. When the branch invites the masses to participate in Party meetings to discuss the admission of new Party members, most workers can speak enthusiastically. If new Party members have any shortcomings, the masses can sincerely point them out. If Party members make mistakes, the workers often give them stern criticism. In the Second Division, one day everyone talked about the issue of serving the people. A Party member said: "Who is working not for millet!" The workers immediately criticized him and said: "We must oppose the millet-brain mentality. You are a Party member and should not say such things even more."

    Party branch meetings and group meetings in the workshops are generally convened on time. Recently, criticism and self-criticism have been carried out to review everyone's shortcomings and mistakes in production. It has played a certain role in educating Party members. Party member Zhang Zhiye often leaves his job to talk to others during production. At the group meeting, everyone criticized him for not being active in production. He said that he was going to unite the masses for production. Everyone said to him: "Uniting the masses is of course important, but you must also take the lead in playing an exemplary role; otherwise, you cannot unite the masses." In the end, he accepted everyone's opinions and paid attention to correcting his mistakes.

    The General Branch Leadership Has Vague Ideas and the Superior Conditions Have Not Been Utilized

    The above situation shows that the Party organization of the 70th Arsenal has good conditions for ensuring production. However, the General Branch Committee has failed to utilize it well. The General Branch's guarantee and supervision of production are limited to general appeals. When the General Branch formulates the Party's work plan, it rarely convenes each branch committee to discuss and study based on the specific situation. After the work is deployed, there is rarely any inspection and summary. The problems reported by the branches are often delayed and cannot be resolved in a timely manner. The branches have repeatedly raised to the General Branch: How can the branch guarantee and supervise production? The General Branch has not seriously studied and instructed. For example, when the current General Branch Committee member and Branch Secretary Li Ben went to another factory as Branch Secretary in August, the branch only introduced him to more than a dozen Party members, and did not introduce him to other administrative and labor union cadres and workers. Therefore, everyone did not know what Li Ben was doing, which made his work extremely inconvenient. After reporting to the General Branch, the General Branch delayed for two months before notifying the administration to let Li Ben participate in production meetings.

    Because the General Branch leadership's thinking is not clear on relying on workers to improve production, it cannot make good use of these conditions, so that the labor enthusiasm of Party members and workers cannot be fully utilized, and the Party's task of guaranteeing and supervising production cannot be well completed.

    Recently, the General Branch Committee of the factory has conducted a more in-depth review with the direct help of the Factory Branch Work Section of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department. This spirit of daring to correct mistakes is good. It is hoped that the General Branch Committee will not be satisfied with the current review and should seek effective improvement in its work.

### 七十兵工厂党组织的基础（报告之二）

　　七十兵工厂党组织的基础
    （报告之二）
    本报记者  商恺
    一年来，北京七十兵工厂的生产，未能获得令人满意的成绩，存在着许多急待解决的问题。基本原因之一，是由于该厂中共总支委员会的工作没有面向生产。
    但是，七十兵工厂党的基础如何，党团员在生产中曾起了些什么作用呢？记者就这一问题，又走访了该厂，发现全厂蕴藏着一种巨大的力量，这种力量虽然长期未被运用和发挥，但它已经在各工房、车间，像星星点点的火花一样在迸发着。一百七十名共产党员，和二百名青年团员满怀劳动热情，期望把生产搞得更好。
    一九四六年，七十兵工厂建立了党的地下组织，由一二人逐渐发展到十几个人。在国民党匪帮恐怖统治下，他们艰苦奋斗一直坚持到去年一月北京解放前夕。解放前又英勇地组织工人保护工厂。解放后的第一个“五一”节，厂方发动了生产竞赛，党员工人以无比的热情投入运动，获得了显著成绩。
    新党员经验还不足  迫切需要帮助教育
    去年七月党的组织公开，九月开始大发展，至今年二月底，党员已发展到一百六十八名，约占全体职工百分之十。其中百分之八十以上都是技术工人，直接掌握生产的工长、组长有不少是共产党员。他们和群众有着比较密切的联系。党员中百分之七十以上是新党员，受党的教育很少，政治水平较低。他们有工作热情，但缺少办法。懂得党员要团结群众积极生产，但不知道如何去团结群众，带领群众，怎样给群众解决问题，如何解释党的政策，提高群众觉悟，鼓动群众生产热情。群众向党员提出许多问题，如中苏条约，年终奖金，胜利公债等，党员很少能给以解释，所以党员在群众中的威望不高。但一般的都能在生产中起模范带头作用。例如六所号召大家订个人生产计划时，党、团员都能带头拟定，并在大会上宣读，保证坚决完成任务。党员王明柱带领一个工人原定每天做卡盘抓等四十五块，后来很快的便达到每天出品六十六块的纪录，而且保证合乎规格。从干训班学习归来的党员张德林和青年团员研究改进了工具，生产效率较用原来的工具时提高了百分之六十。每次下班时，各所最后洗手出厂的大多数都是共产党员和青年团员。如果党员能够善于团结群众，则所起的作用也就更大。如：在六所里，党、政、工、团配合的比较好，生产任务来了，或生产中发生了问题，大家便凑在一起及时研究解决。在七所里是以一个组或几个组为生产单位，共同生产一件大的产品，所以党员所发挥的积极作用，便容易带起群众，提高生产效率。该所去年十一月份每人每天加班三小时，出四套水泵，到十二月份，不但不用加班，而且还多出一套水泵。
    工人对党关心爱护  要求党员比较严格
    虽然一般党员在群众中威望不高，但工人们却一致热爱中国共产党。因而他们对共产党员的要求与监督也比较严格。有些工人满心愿意参加共产党，但又考虑到自己的生产积极性不高，不够一个共产党员的条件，因而没有申请入党。在支部邀请群众参加党的会议讨论新党员入党时，大多数工人都能热烈发言。新党员有什么缺点，群众都能诚恳地提出。党员犯了错误，工人们常给以严正地批评。在二所里，有一天大家谈论到为人民服务的问题。一个党员说：“谁干活不是为了小米！”工人立刻就批评他说：“咱们要反对小米脑袋，你是个党员更不该说这样的话。”
    工房中党的支部会、小组会，一般的都能按时召集。最近开展了批评与自我批评，检讨每个人在生产中的缺点和错误。在教育党员上，起了一定的作用。党员张志业，常在生产中离开工作岗位，去和别人谈话。在小组会上，大家便批评他生产不积极，他说，他是去团结群众生产。大家又对他说：“团结群众当然重要，但自己也要积极带头起模范作用才成；否则也不能团结群众。”最后他接受了大家的意见，注意改正自己的错误。
    总支领导思想模糊  优越条件未能发挥
    上述情况说明七十兵工厂的党组织中，有着保证生产的良好条件。但是总支委员会却未能很好的运用。总支对党保证与监督生产，只停留在一般的号召上。总支制订党的工作计划时，很少召集各分支委根据具体情况讨论研究。工作布置以后，也很少有过检查和总结。分支汇报上来的问题，常常拖延积压不能及时解决。各分支曾屡次向总支提出：支部如何保证与监督生产。总支却未认真研究和指示。又如现任总支委兼分支书李本，八月到外厂任分支书时，支部只介绍给他十几个党员，而未向其他行政和工会干部及工人介绍。因此大家都不知李本是干什么的，使他工作上极不方便。报告总支后，总支拖了两月之久，才通知行政上让李本参加生产会议。
    由于总支领导思想对依靠工人搞好生产不明确，便不能很好地利用这些条件，使得党员和工人群众的劳动热情不能充分发挥，党保证与监督生产的任务也无法很好完成。
    最近该厂总支委员会，已在北京市委组织部工厂支部工作科直接帮助下，进行了比较深刻的检讨。这种勇于改正错误的精神是好的，希望总支委员会不要以目前的检讨为满足，应在工作中求得有效地改进。
