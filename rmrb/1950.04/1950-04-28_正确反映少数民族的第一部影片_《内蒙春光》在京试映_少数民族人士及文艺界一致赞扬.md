The First Film to Correctly Reflect Ethnic Minorities
    *Spring in Inner Mongolia* Previewed in Beijing
    Unanimously Praised by Ethnic Minorities and Literary and Art Circles

    [By Our Newspaper] The Central Film Bureau held a preview of the feature film *Spring in Inner Mongolia*, recently completed by the Northeast Film Studio, at the Dahua Cinema at 9:00 AM on the 23rd for representatives of various ethnic minorities and various organizations. Yun Ze, Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture, and others attended. Before the screening, Deputy Director Liu Geping spoke, pointing out that the theme depicted in this film changes the slander, rumor-mongering, feuds, and attempts to create division by internal and external reactionaries against ethnic minorities for thousands of years, and plays a role in promoting the unity, mutual assistance, and common life of all ethnic groups in the country in a free and happy family. He also presented a banner to the Central Film Bureau's Northeast Film Studio on behalf of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, with the inscription: "Correctly Reflecting the Facts of the Liberation Struggle of the People of Inner Mongolia." The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also presented a banner with the inscription: "Long Live the Unity and Mutual Assistance of Mongolian and Han Brothers!" After Gan Xuewei, the director of the film, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the Film Bureau, the film was shown. The Central Film Bureau, considering that the film was co-produced with the Inner Mongolia Literary and Art Troupe, decided to present the troupe with a copy of the film and a banner to express its gratitude.

    [Another Report] *Spring in Inner Mongolia* is a new production of the Northeast Film Studio. In order to widely collect opinions from various ethnic minorities and literary and art circles, the Film Bureau has convened three symposiums since April 20th. The participating units included the Beijing Office of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Nationalities Affairs Section of the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, the Inner Mongolia Military Region, the Beijing Hui Committee, the Mongolian and Tibetan College, the Hui People's College, the Inner Mongolia Daily, the Criticism Group of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Southwest Inspection Group, the Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Visiting Group, and the Tibetan People's Training Class. At the symposium, the film's achievements were unanimously praised, and it was pointed out that:

   The Characteristics of *Spring in Inner Mongolia*

    (1) *Spring in Inner Mongolia* is the first film in the history of Chinese cinema to correctly reflect ethnic minorities. It not only concretely and profoundly depicts the life and struggle of the people of Inner Mongolia, allowing compatriots across the country to have a preliminary understanding of the specific situation of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group, but also clearly expresses the great unity of the Mongolian and Han nationalities in its theme, and the entire film is permeated with Chairman Mao's policy of equality and unity among nationalities. Because this film has extremely rich content and lively and moving stories interspersed, it expresses a strong class contrast and national unity through specific characters and events, and correctly visualizes the Party's national policy in the film.

    (2) This film can not only educate those among ethnic minorities who hold narrow nationalist ideas, but also correctly reflects the poison of the Kuomintang reactionaries' Han chauvinism and the need to eliminate this erroneous viewpoint. At the same time, this film also points out that these two erroneous viewpoints are built on the upper ruling class, not the working people.

    (3) Ethnic minorities in newly liberated areas urgently need to see films of this kind of subject matter. This film has a certain value and educational role in revolutionary theory, class struggle, and ideological transformation. If it can be recorded into copies in the languages of various ethnic minorities and screened in depth in ethnic minority areas, its educational effect will certainly be great.

    (4) This film not only demonstrates the unity of the Mongolian and Han nationalities and the historical events of the Inner Mongolian people's liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Yun Ze, Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also fully demonstrates the great unity of the Mongolian and Han nationalities during the filming of this film.

    (5) In the past, most of the feature films produced by state-owned factories were in the form of documentaries. This film, due to its correct theme, clear characterization, rich content, tight plot, and close combination of ideology and artistry, has improved people's films a step further.

　　正确反映少数民族的第一部影片
    《内蒙春光》在京试映
    少数民族人士及文艺界一致赞扬
    【本报讯】中央电影局于廿三日上午九时假座大华影院招待各少数民族代表及各机关试映东北电影制片厂最近完成之故事片《内蒙春光》。内蒙自治区人民政府云泽主席、民族事务委员会刘格平副主任、文化部周扬副部长等出席参加。放映前，刘格平副主任讲话，指出：这部影片所描写的主题，改变了千百年来内外反动派对少数民族的污蔑、造谣、仇杀、制造分裂的看法，起了推动全国各民族互相团结、帮助，共同生活于自由幸福的大家庭中的作用。他并代表民族事务委员会向中央电影局东北电影制片厂赠锦旗一面，题词为：“正确反映内蒙人民解放斗争的事实”。内蒙古自治区人民政府亦赠旗一面，题词为：“蒙汉兄弟民族团结互助万岁！”。由该片导演干学伟代表电影局致谢词后，即放映该片。中央电影局以该片系与内蒙文艺工作团合作演出者，决以该片拷贝一个及锦旗一面赠送该团以表谢意。
    【又讯】《内蒙春光》是东北电影制片厂的新出品，电影局为了广泛收集各少数民族及文艺界的意见，特自四月二十日起分别召集了三个座谈会，出席单位计有内蒙自治区人民政府驻京办事处、民族事务委员会、京民政局民族事务科、内蒙军区、京市回委会、蒙藏学院、回民学院、内蒙古日报、文联批评小组、西南巡视团、西北各族青年、妇女参观团、藏民训练班等。座谈会上一致对本片成绩予以赞扬，指出：
  《内蒙春光》的特点
    （一）《内蒙春光》是中国电影有史以来第一部正确反映少数民族的影片。它不但具体地、深刻地描写了内蒙人民的生活和斗争事迹，使全国同胞对内蒙民族的具体情况有了初步的了解；同时，在主题思想上也明确地表现了蒙汉民族的大团结，整个片子贯串了毛主席的平等、团结的民族政策。因为本片有着极丰富的内容和活泼动人的故事穿插，通过了具体人物事件表现了强烈的阶级对比与民族团结，把党的民族政策在影片中正确的形象化了。
    （二）本片不但可以教育少数民族间抱有狭隘民族主义思想者；同时也正确的反映了国民党反动派的大汉族主义思想的毒害和必须清除这种错误的观点。同时这部片子里并指出了这两种错误的观点是建筑在上层统治阶级，并不是劳动人民。
    （三）在新解放的地区少数民族很需要看到这种题材的影片，本片对革命理论、阶级斗争、思想改造都有着他的一定价值和教育作用。如果能用各少数民族的语言录成拷贝，深入少数民族地区放映，它的教育作用一定是很大的。
    （四）本片不只是表现了蒙汉民族的团结和在中国共产党及内蒙自治区人民政府云泽主席领导下内蒙人民翻身的史迹；而在拍摄本片时也充分地表现了蒙汉民族的大团结。
    （五）过去国营厂出品的故事片多半是纪录的形式，这部影片由于主题正确，人物刻划清楚，内容充实丰富，故事紧凑，思想性和艺术性的紧密结合，使人民电影提高了一步。
