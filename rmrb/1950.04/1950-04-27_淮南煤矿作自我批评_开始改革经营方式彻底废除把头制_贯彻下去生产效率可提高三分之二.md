Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The leading cadres of the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine in East China neglected the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference and failed to implement them for a long time. No fundamental improvements have been made in various tasks. After studying the "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," serious shortcomings are now being corrected.

	The Production Conditions Are Quite Favorable,
	But They Have Not Been Fully Utilized

	The coal seams in the mine are regular, there is little water in the pits, and the roof and floor are good. The number of engineering and technical personnel is greater than in any other coal mine in the country. There are also many skilled veteran workers in the mine, most of whom have underground production experience. Its production conditions can be described as quite favorable. However, the leading cadres of the mine did not pay enough attention to the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference and failed to implement them seriously for several months, so that the favorable conditions could not be fully utilized, and no fundamental improvements were made in various tasks. The labor organization of the "Labor-Cooperative Team" (劳合班) still essentially retained the feudal headman system. Workers' wages were still exploited, and the waste of labor was almost half. Under these circumstances, the enthusiasm of the workers could not be well improved, and labor discipline was quite lax, so that production efficiency was less than half that of the northern mines. Its management methods have not yet been enterprise-oriented, and the expenditure system is still very chaotic, so the cost is as high as two or even three times that of the northern mines. In the context of national financial difficulties, its construction projects are not prioritized according to importance and urgency, and there is no focus. Even more money was spent on non-productive municipal construction. The leadership failed to properly persuade the conservative thinking of the engineering personnel, and the coal mining method has not been changed to the longwall method (长臂式), but still uses the backward residual pillar method (残柱式), which is dangerous, loses a lot of coal, and is not easy to manage, so the recovery rate is only 50 percent. Most seriously, the mine's leading organs underestimated the risk of fire, and most mines have no safety equipment.

	Workers' Wisdom and Creativity
	Have Not Been Valued by Leading Cadres

	The reason why the mine has not paid attention to and implemented the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference is mainly because the leading cadres have extremely insufficient understanding of democratic management and enterprise-oriented management. For example, the workers of the Xinzhuangzi Mine set a new record of 1,250 tons per day with a 75-horsepower winch, and the workers of the machine factory successfully imitated the electric welding machine, which repeatedly demonstrated the wisdom and creativity of the working class, but did not attract the attention of the mine's leading cadres. The coal miners of the mine once suggested changing the coal mining method to the longwall method, but it was not adopted. The experience of the Datong Mine in reforming the "Labor-Cooperative Team," democratically selecting team leaders, and thereby reducing the number of people and increasing production efficiency by one-third has not been paid attention to and promoted.

	Recently, after studying the document "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," the mine's leading cadres began to realize the importance of the tasks undertaken by state-owned enterprises. If they do not quickly implement the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference and implement democratic management and enterprise-oriented management, they will not be able to complete the tasks they should undertake. They immediately made self-criticism and began to correct various shortcomings. The construction plan to improve the coal mining method has been specifically arranged in the eighth and ninth slots of the Xinzhuangzi Mine, the north second slot of the Jiulonggang Mine, and the south second slot of the Datong Mine. At the same time, the labor organization is being reformed, and a short-term training class for 600 workers has been held for this purpose. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, if the mine can resolutely and concretely implement this spirit of reform, its production efficiency can be increased by two-thirds, and the cost can be reduced by one-half, and the continued development of the entire mine will be unlimited.

### 淮南煤矿作自我批评  开始改革经营方式彻底废除把头制  贯彻下去生产效率可提高三分之二

　　淮南煤矿作自我批评
    开始改革经营方式彻底废除把头制
    贯彻下去生产效率可提高三分之二
    【新华社二十五日讯】华东区国营淮南煤矿领导干部忽视全国煤矿会议的决议，长时不加执行，各项工作迄无根本改进，经学习“政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定”后，严重缺点现正进行纠正。
  生产条件相当优越
  但却没有充分利用
    该矿煤层正规，坑内水少，顶底板均较好，工程技术人员多于全国任何煤矿，矿场中熟练的老工人也较多，且大部具有井下生产经验，其生产条件可谓相当优越。但该矿领导干部对全国煤矿会议的决议极不重视，数月内迄未认真执行，以致优越条件不能充分利用，各项工作没有根本改进。其“劳合班”的劳动组织实质上仍然保留着封建把头制，工人工资还被剥削，劳动力的浪费几乎在半数左右。在此情况下，工人积极性不能很好提高，劳动纪律相当松懈，以致生产效率尚不及北方各矿的二分之一。其经营方式迄未企业化，开支制度还很紊乱，因而成本高达北方各矿二倍甚至三倍。在国家财政困难情况下，其修建工程亦不分先后缓急，没有重点，甚至对非生产的市政建设却花了更多钱。领导上对工程人员的保守思想未能善加说服，采煤方法迄未改行长臂式，而仍旧沿用危险性大、丢煤多、不易管理的落后的残柱式，因而回采率仅及百分之五十。尤其严重者，该矿领导机关对于火的危险性估计不足，多数矿井尚无保安设备。
  工人智慧和创造力
  领导干部未加重视
    该矿所以未重视与执行全国煤矿会议的决议，主要是领导干部对管理民主化与经营企业化的认识极为不够。诸如该矿新庄子矿场工人以七十五马力绞车创日绞一二五○吨新纪录、机厂工人仿造电焊机成功的例子，均一再显示工人阶级的智慧与创造力，但并未引起该矿领导干部的重视。该矿刨煤工人曾有改变采煤方法为长臂式的建议，亦未被采纳。其大通矿场改造“劳合班”、民主选组长、因而既减少了人数又能提高生产效率三分之一的经验，亦未被注意予以总结推广。
    最近经学习“政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定”的文件后，该矿领导干部始感到国营企业所负任务之重大，如不迅速执行全国煤矿会议决议，实行民主管理与企业化，将无法完成应负之任务，随即作了自我批评，并开始进行各项缺点的改正。现已在新庄子矿八九两槽、九龙岗矿北二槽及大通矿南二槽具体布置了改进采煤法的施工计划，同时进行改革劳动组织，并为此举办了六百名工人的短期训练班。据中央人民政府燃料工业部负责人谈：如该矿能将此改革精神坚决地具体地贯彻下去，其生产效率即可提高三分之二，而成本可降低二分之一，整个矿山工作的继续发展是不可限量的。
