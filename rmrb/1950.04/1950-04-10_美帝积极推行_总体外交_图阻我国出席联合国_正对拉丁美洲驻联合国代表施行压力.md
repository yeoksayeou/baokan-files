Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The US State Department, in order to sabotage the work of the United Nations and promote its so-called "total diplomacy," is exerting strong pressure on diplomatic representatives of certain Latin American countries to the United Nations. According to a TASS dispatch from Mexico City on the 8th, the US State Department has recently been very active in trying to replace several Latin American diplomatic representatives to the United Nations who are not favored by Washington. The United States is now using various means of coercion and enticement—political pressure and economic pressure, as well as other "persuasion" methods—to deal with the governments of Central and South American countries. The State Department is also arrogantly demanding that it expel several Latin American diplomats it dislikes from New York, on the grounds that Washington believes these diplomats are too concerned about an early resolution to a major international issue—the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations bodies. A special "purge" is currently underway among Latin American diplomats.

However, concern about China's representation in the United Nations is not the only reason for the current "purge" of Latin American representatives to the United Nations. The State Department, which is pushing its notorious "total" diplomacy, is demanding that the governments of several Latin American republics replace or remove these representatives to the United Nations because they "arbitrarily" speak or vote from time to time against Washington's will.

Despite the fact that Washington's rude diplomatic actions and secretive activities have aroused significant resentment in Latin American countries, under the pressure of Wall Street's political and economic "arguments," the activities of expelling and replacing Latin American diplomatic representatives are still underway.

　　美帝积极推行“总体外交”
    图阻我国出席联合国   
    正对拉丁美洲驻联合国代表施行压力
    【新华社九日讯】美国国务院为了破坏联合国的工作与推行所谓“总体外交”，正对某些拉丁美洲国家驻联合国的外交代表，施用强大压力。据塔斯社墨西哥城八日讯，美国国务院近来非常活跃，试图撤换若干个不为华盛顿所喜悦的拉丁美洲国家驻联合国的外交代表。美国现正使用各种威迫利诱的手段——政治压力与经济压力以及其他“劝诱”办法——来对付中南美国家的政府。国务院并强横地要求把它不喜悦若干个的拉丁美洲外交人员逐出纽约，理由是华盛顿方面认为这些外交人员对于尽早解决一项重大国际问题——中华人民共和国在联合国机构中的代表权问题，过于关心。目前正在拉丁美洲国家的外交人员中进行特种“清洗”。
    但是关心中国在联合国中的代表权问题，并不是拉丁美洲驻联合国代表目前被“清洗”的唯一原因。推行臭名昭彰的“总体”外交的国务院，要求若干拉丁美洲共和国的政府撤换或革除这些驻联合国的代表，因为他们时时违反华盛顿的意志而“随意”发言或投票。
    尽管华盛顿外交的无礼行动与鬼祟的活动，已在拉丁美洲国家引起显著的愤慨，但在华尔街的政治与经济的“论据”的压力下，驱逐与撤换拉丁美洲的外交代表的活动仍在进行中。
