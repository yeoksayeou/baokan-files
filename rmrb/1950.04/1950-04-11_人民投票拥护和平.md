Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd (TASS): The Pravda newspaper recently published an editorial entitled "People's Vote Supports Peace!":

　　Strive for peace, oppose war! Strive for peaceful labor, oppose the arms race! Strive for peaceful cooperation among all nations, oppose atomic hysteria and atomic blackmail, oppose instigators of new wars! This is the will of all peoples, the will of hundreds of millions of people united in the powerful peace movement. The appeal unanimously adopted at the Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Stockholm clearly demonstrates the unyielding will to strive for peace and the determination to resolutely fight against war instigators.

　　The appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council states: "We demand the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons as weapons of mass destruction against humanity and the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of this resolution. We believe that any government that first uses atomic weapons against any other country is a war criminal. We call on the people of the world to sign this appeal."

　　The first lists of peace supporters who signed the Standing Committee's appeal have already been published.

　　In these lists, we see workers and farmers, scientists and students, writers and journalists, priests (Catholic and Christian) and lawyers, engineers and singers, politicians and representatives of trade unions, people from all continents and countries, men and women of different races, different political views and beliefs, people living in socialist societies and people living in capitalist societies.

　　Like millions of participants in the peace movement, they are all united by a noble purpose: to support peace, to save mankind from another world massacre, which the forces of imperialist reaction, acting for the benefit of a small group of selfish and greedy people blinded by profit and power, want to drag humanity into.

　　In the struggle for peace, for saving mankind from the horrors of war, for saving the culture created by human genius and labor, the builders of socialism, the representatives of the oppressed colonial peoples, and the men and women who still believe in the capitalist system, have found a common language.

　　The movement for peace is growing stronger. Peace fighters are adopting new and more active forms of struggle to strive for peace and to oppose warmongers. They are gradually convinced of the effectiveness of their struggle in action. The heroic actions of French dockworkers forced American imperialist ships transporting weapons to France to turn back. American imperialists then transported these weapons to ports in French colonies in Africa. However, the working people there also responded to the measures of American imperialists with strikes and protest rallies. Port workers in Oslo and Hamburg, following the example of dockworkers in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Australia, refused to unload American weapons.

　　In the Netherlands, the working people held massive protest demonstrations under the slogan "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in response to the meeting of the military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The movement to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is underway in Denmark. In Norway, the Peace Congress has set itself the current goal of uniting the existing twenty organizations striving for peace. In the United States, the committee established at the All-American Trade Union Representatives Conference in Chicago is making smooth progress in collecting signatures for the appeal to Truman demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons. Canada is preparing to convene an All-Canada Peace Congress, and the work of collecting 200,000 signatures for the appeal is being organized. The scale of the peace movement in Latin American countries has become increasingly large.

　　The resolutions passed by the Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council have been widely and enthusiastically responded to in those countries where this movement has been launched on the largest scale, and in those places where this movement has not yet penetrated deeply into the masses of the people. The British Peace Committee has decided to start collecting signatures throughout the UK for the appeal to be submitted to Parliament before the summer holiday. The British Peace Committee's statement points out that in order to collect millions of citizens' signatures (regardless of their party, belief, profession or affiliated interest group) this appeal calls for a ban on atomic weapons and declares the government that first uses such weapons to be a war criminal, to be a criminal against all humanity.

　　The appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council will lead to the further expansion of the peace front, drawing more and more new forces to participate in this front. And this is the main task facing the peace movement. Peace supporters are facing specific and current goals - banning atomic weapons and declaring the government that first uses atomic weapons against any country to be a war criminal. All peace supporters, all honest men and women, have clearly realized how important it is to achieve this goal, especially now, when the forces of imperialist reaction, driven by economic crisis and losing confidence in the future, are pursuing an increasingly rampant, desperate and crazy policy.

　　The warmongers are shocked by the growing scale of the movement for peace. They are not only stepping up their war preparations, they are subjecting the people of their countries to large-scale police repression, and they are taking measures to stifle the last vestiges of democratic freedom. France and Italy, on the orders of Wall Street, have adopted emergency decrees that openly pave the way for blatant police terror. The warmongers want to use them to ensure the realization of their criminal plans and to frustrate the peace movement. The strike movement in France and the protest movement in Italy show that the working people of these countries are resisting reactionaries and war. Nevertheless, the events in France and Italy show the urgent need to strengthen the struggle against war instigators. All nations are voting for peace! Hundreds of millions of men and women around the world are signing the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. This vote of all nations will be a new and stern warning to the warmongers. It shows the growing power of the movement for peace, which can stop and frustrate the criminal plans of the war instigators and stop any imperialist aggression. Collecting signatures for the appeal of the Standing Committee is a glorious thing for peace supporters in every country. It has become possible for all the people of all nations to vote for peace, because hundreds of millions of men and women on all continents are increasingly aware that the struggle against war and for the defense of peace is the cause of all nations around the world.

　　The organized front of peace supporters is powerful and cannot be defeated. Emerging new forces are gathering under the great banner of this front, consolidating their ranks in the struggle against warmongers. The Soviet Union - the reliable fortress and hope of all working people - is the standard-bearer in the struggle for world peace. The people's democratic countries and liberated China stand at the forefront of peace fighters. The growing front of peace fighters relies on the support of international democratic mass organizations such as trade unions, women's organizations and youth organizations, which unite hundreds of millions of fighters in this team.

　　The Soviet people, united around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and unswervingly carrying out a consistent struggle for peace, unanimously support the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Soviet people will continue to fight for peace throughout the world with their inherent firmness and ability!

### 人民投票拥护和平

专栏：真理报社论

　　人民投票拥护和平
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：真理报顷以“人民投票拥护和平！”为题，发表社论如下：
    争取和平，反对战争！争取和平劳动，反对军备竞赛！争取各民族间的和平合作，反对原子歇斯底里和原子吓诈，反对新战争挑拨者！这就是各族人民的意志，是团结在强大的和平运动中的亿万群众的意志。和大常设委员会在斯德哥尔摩举行的第三次会议上全体一致通过的呼吁书，明确地表现出争取和平的不屈不挠的意志和坚决地向战争挑拨者进行斗争的决心。
    和大常设委员会的呼吁书这样说：“我们要求无条件地禁止把原子武器用作大规模毁灭人类的武器，并建立严格的国际管制，以确保这一决议的执行。我们认为，任何第一个使用原子武器来对付任何其他国家的政府，就是战争罪犯。我们号召全世界人们在这个呼吁书上签名”。
    在常设委员会呼吁书上签名的和平拥护者的第一批名单已经发表了。
    在这些名单中，我们看到了工人与农民，科学家与学生，作家与新闻记者，教士（天主教徒及基督教徒）与律师，工程师与歌唱家，政治家与工会组织的代表，各洲各国的人民，不同种族、不同政治见解与信仰的男女，生活在社会主义社会以及生活在资本主义社会的人民的名字。
    像千百万和平运动的参加者一样，他们全被一个崇高的目的团结起来，这目的就是：拥护和平，拯救人类免受另一次世界屠杀，而帝国主义反动派的力量，为了一小群被利润与权力薰心的自私自利的贪婪家伙的利益而行动的力量，却想把人类拖入这些屠杀中。
    在为和平、为拯救人类免受战争恐怖、为拯救人类的天才与劳动所创造的文化而进行的斗争中，社会主义的建设者、被压迫的殖民地各族人民的代表以及仍然相信资本主义制度的男女，找到了共通的言语。
    争取和平的运动正在成长壮大。和平斗士正在采取新的、更积极的斗争形式去争取和平，去反对战争贩子。他们在行动中逐渐确信他们斗争的效力了。法国码头工人的英勇行动，迫使美帝国主义者运送武器至法国的船只折回。美帝国主义者就把这些武器运往非洲法属殖民地的港口。然而，那儿的劳动人民也用罢工和抗议集会来回答美帝国主义者的措施。奥斯陆和汉堡的港口工人，效法法国、比利时、荷兰和澳大利亚码头工人的榜样，拒绝起卸美国武器。
    在荷兰，劳动人民在“打倒北大西洋公约”的口号下举行声势浩大的抗议示威游行，以回答北大西洋公约军事领袖们的会议。退出北大西洋公约的运动，正在丹麦进行着。在挪威，拥护和平大会为自身规定了当前的目标——统一现有的二十个争取和平的组织。在美国，在芝加哥全美工会代表会议上所成立的委员会，正在为致杜鲁门要求禁止使用原子武器的呼吁书收集签名，工作在顺利进行中。加拿大正在准备召开全加拥护和平代表大会，同时，为呼吁书搜集二十万签名的工作，正在组织中。拉丁美洲各国拥护和平运动的规模已越来越大。
    和大常设委员会第三次会议所通过的决议，在那些已经最大规模地展开了这一运动的国家中，以及在这一运动尚未深入人民群众的那些地方，都已得到广泛而热烈的响应。英国和平委员会已决定要为即将在暑假前呈交议会的呼吁书在英国全国范围内开始收集签名。英国和平委员会的声明指出：为了要收集数以百万计的公民签名（不管他们的党派、信仰、职业或所属利益集团为何）的这一呼吁书，号召禁止原子武器，号召把第一个使用这种武器的政府宣布为战犯，宣布为与全人类作对的罪犯。
    和大常设委员会的呼吁书，将导致和平阵线的进一步扩大，吸取越来越多的新的力量参加到这一阵线中来。而这就是和平运动所面临的主要任务。和平拥护者正面临着具体的、现时的目标——禁止原子武器、宣布第一个使用原子武器对付任何国家的政府为战犯。所有和平拥护者、一切正直的男女已明确地认识到，特别在现在，当那被经济危机所驱使且对将来失去信心的帝国主义反动力量正在进行那日益猖獗的、绝望而疯狂的政策时，达到这一目标是具有多么巨大的重要意义。
    战争贩子们为争取和平运动日益增大的规模所震惊。他们不仅加强他们的战争准备工作，他们正对他们国家的人民大肆施以警察的镇压，他们正采取措施来扼杀最后一点痕迹的民主自由。法国和意大利奉华尔街的命令，采取了紧急法令，该法令公开地为肆无忌惮的警察恐怖打开了道路。战争贩子们想借它们之助来保证其罪恶计划的实现和挫败和平运动。法国的罢工运动和意大利的抗议运动，表明这些国家的劳动人民正在抵抗反动派和战争。虽然如此，法国和意大利的事件，说明急需加强反对战争挑拨者的斗争。各族人民正在投票拥护和平！全世界亿万男女正在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书上签名。各族人民的这一投票，将是对战争贩子新的严正警告。它显示了争取和平运动的日益增大的威力，能够阻止并挫败战争教唆者的罪恶计划、制止任何帝国主义的侵略。收集和大常设委员会呼吁书签名的工作，是每一个国家和平拥护者光荣的事情。各族全体人民投票拥护和平已成为可能，因为世界各洲的亿万男女越来越明白：反对战争保卫和平的斗争，是全世界各民族的事业。
    和平拥护者有组织的阵线，是强大的，而且是不能被战胜的。不断涌现的新力量正集合在这个阵线的伟大的旗帜下，在反对战争贩子的斗争中巩固着它们的队伍。苏联——全体劳动人民可靠的堡垒与希望——是争取世界和平的斗争中的旗手。各人民民主国家和解放了的中国站在和平斗士的前列。和平斗士日益壮大的阵线，倚靠着工会、妇女组织与青年组织等国际民主群众组织的支持，它们在这一队伍中团结了亿万斗士。
    团结在列宁——斯大林党的周围、并坚定不移地为和平而进行始终如一的斗争的苏联人民，一致拥护世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书。苏联人民将以其固有的坚定与能力继续为全世界的和平而斗争！
