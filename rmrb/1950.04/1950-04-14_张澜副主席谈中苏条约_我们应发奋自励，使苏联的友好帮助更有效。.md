Xinhua News Agency, April 12th:

　　Central People's Government Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Democratic League, Zhang Lan, made a statement regarding the Central People's Government Committee's sixth meeting's approval of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, stating:

　　The signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty is of extremely great significance to the people of China and the Soviet Union and to the cause of peace and democracy worldwide. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky made this very clear at the signing ceremony.

　　Foreign Minister Zhou said: "The conclusion of these treaties and agreements is based on the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and will become a symbol of the fraternal friendship and permanent cooperation between China and the Soviet Union... It will inevitably have a significant impact and result on the cause of peace and justice for mankind in the East and the world."

　　Vyshinsky said: "The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance demonstrates the desire of our two peoples for permanent friendship and cooperation between our two countries, as well as for the peace and security of all nations... It is a most significant contribution to consolidating the cause of peace and democracy throughout the world."

　　The truthfulness of these two statements has been fully proven in the two months since the treaty was signed, from the unanimous support for the Sino-Soviet treaty by the peace-loving people of China, the Soviet Union, and the world. Even when the imperialists spoke with the aim of slander and vilification, they could not help but first admit that the new Sino-Soviet treaty was an equal treaty. This is even more powerful corroboration.

　　Since the new Sino-Soviet treaty is unanimously recognized by the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people around the world as a treaty that conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and can consolidate world peace, the approval of this treaty and its accompanying agreements and exchange of notes at the Central People's Government Committee meeting, I believe, will be unanimously regarded as an honor, and will certainly be supported by all peace-loving people in the world.

　　Finally, I would like to reiterate that the main reason why the new Sino-Soviet treaty could be signed is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the heroic struggle of the people throughout the country, which eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries on the Chinese mainland. If we had not been able to advance the Chinese revolution to its current stage, no matter how much the Soviet Union sympathized with the Chinese revolution, the signing of such a new treaty would still have to be delayed! Therefore, after the conclusion of this new treaty, we should, on the one hand, thank the Soviet Union for its profound friendship towards us, and on the other hand, strive for self-improvement and work harder to eliminate the remaining bandits and build a new China! In the construction of the new China, only when we show greater achievements can the Soviet Union's friendly assistance be more effective! Even further!

　　张澜副主席谈中苏条约
    我们应发奋自励，使苏联的友好帮助更有效。
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府副主席、民主同盟主席张澜，就中央人民政府委员会第六次会议通过批准中苏友好同盟互助条约，发表谈话称：
    中苏新约之签订对于中苏两国人民和全世界的和平民主事业有极重大的意义。我们的周恩来外长和苏联的维辛斯基外长在签字式上已说得很明白。
    周外长说：“这些条约和协定的缔结，是根据中苏两国人民的根本利益，并将成为中苏两国兄弟友谊和永久合作的标志，……对于东方与世界的人类和平与正义的事业将不可免的形成重大的影响和结果。”
    维辛斯基外长说：“友好同盟互助条约表现出了我们两国人民对于我们两个国家的永久的友好与合作，以及对于各国人民的和平与安全所抱的愿望。……对于巩固全世界的和平与民主的事业是一个最重大的贡献。”
    这两段话的真实性，在条约签订迄今的两个月内，从中苏两国和全世界酷爱和平的人民对于中苏条约一致拥护的舆论中，完全证明了。甚至帝国主义者抱着诽谤诬蔑的目的而发言时他们也不能不先承认中苏新约是平等的条约。这更是有力的旁证。
    中苏新约既是中苏和全世界爱好和平的人民一致公认的符合中苏两国人民根本利益，并能巩固全世界和平的条约，这个条约及其附带的协定换文在中央人民政府委员会会议上批准，相信大家必将一致的引为荣幸，同时且必将获得全世界和平爱好者的拥护。
    最后我还想申说一点，就是：中苏新约之所以能够签订，主因还是由于中国共产党，毛主席的正确领导，和全国人民的英勇战斗，在中国大陆上肃清了国民党反动派；如果我们不能把中国的革命推进到当前的阶段，苏联无论如何同情中国的革命，对签订这样的新约，也还是要延缓的！所以我们在订立了这新约之后，应当一面感谢苏联对我们的深挚友好，同时也更应发奋自励，加紧努力为消灭残匪和建设新中国而奋斗！在新中国的建设工作中，只有我们表现出来更伟大的成就时，苏联的友好协助才能更有效！更进一步！
