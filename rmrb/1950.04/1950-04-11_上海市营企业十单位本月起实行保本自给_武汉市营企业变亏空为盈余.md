　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: In view of the fact that Shanghai's municipal enterprises have met the conditions for self-sufficiency after half a year of rectification, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has decided that from April onwards, the municipal treasury will no longer subsidize Shanghai's municipal enterprises, including ten units such as the Public Transportation Company, the Municipal Ferry Company, the Pudong and Huxi Water Plants, and the Wusong Gas Plant. In the early days of liberation, these enterprises were mostly paralyzed due to the long-term corrupt management and looting and destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries before their retreat. All thirty kilns of the Wusong Gas Plant were cold-cracked after being occupied by bandit troops. The working capital of various enterprises was generally exhausted, so that in the initial stage of resuming production, they had to rely on subsidies from the Municipal People's Government. According to statistics, the amount of subsidies to various enterprises from June to December last year accounted for 10.62% of the total municipal treasury expenditure, which was an important expenditure of the municipal finance. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Shanghai's municipal enterprises relied on various unreasonable and disguised subsidies to maintain their operations. For example, the Public Transportation Company relied on loans from the pseudo-Central Bank to hoard gasoline for profit before Shanghai was liberated in 1949. After liberation, the municipal enterprises gradually reformed the bloated bureaucratic institutions. After the Wusong Gas Plant cancelled the general management office outside the plant and reduced the management organization from the original four sections and two offices to three offices and two sections, and the original municipal center office reduced its scope to a business office, it greatly strengthened management efficiency and saved expenses. In the process of transformation, the enterprises also relied on workers to practice economy and improve production efficiency. In particular, since the Public Transportation Company began to implement the responsibility system in October last year, the average mileage of each car per gallon of gasoline was only more than six kilometers in the past, but now it averages 10 to 11 kilometers, and the highest reaches more than 14 kilometers. The recent experiment of replacing gasoline with "white coal" has been successful, and the fuel cost can be reduced by 85.7% when using "white coal" compared to using gasoline. After half a year of hard work and transformation, Shanghai's municipal enterprises have created the basic conditions for self-sufficiency. The Shanghai Municipal Government has therefore decided that from April onwards, the municipal treasury will no longer subsidize the municipal enterprises.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 9th: Thanks to the success of efforts to reduce costs, Wuhan's municipal enterprises have achieved self-sufficiency and even have surpluses. The Jiji Electric and Water Company had a surplus of 1.817 billion yuan in February. The Ferry Management Office uses the factory to support the factory. In the past eight months, it has repaired five ships and two pontoons, which basically guarantees water transportation in the city. The Public Bus Management Office has made up for past losses. The Wuhan Textile Factory still has a surplus after paying for the repair costs of forty cloth machines. Due to the corruption of enterprise management under the Kuomintang rule, the above-mentioned enterprises also experienced a period of money-losing production after liberation. The Hankou Chemical Plant was shut down for a long time before liberation, relying on the sale of machines to maintain the lives of employees; of the one hundred looms in the Wuhan Textile Factory, only seventeen could be started. At the beginning of liberation, the phenomenon of operating deficits in various enterprises was not overcome. The Public Bus Management Office lost 540,000 jin of medium-grade machine rice in May and June last year. The deficit of the Jiji Electric and Water Company in June and July was 1.5 million jin of rice. In order to change this situation, Wuhan's municipal enterprises have made great efforts to reduce costs, save raw materials, and increase production. The Wuhan Public Bus Management Office has saved 70% of fuel costs compared to using gasoline by converting to coal stoves, and reduced lubricating material costs by 50% by making its own engine oil. The coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of the Jiji Electric and Water Company has been reduced by 0.58 kg, and the leakage consumption of electricity has been reduced by 60% compared with before liberation. The leakage consumption of water has been reduced by 20%. The coal consumption per hour of each ferry of the Ferry Management Office has been reduced by nearly one-third. The output of the Central China Paper Mill has increased, but the consumption of coal has decreased. As a result of these efforts, the municipal enterprises have gradually moved from deficits to surpluses.

### 上海市营企业十单位本月起实行保本自给  武汉市营企业变亏空为盈余

　　上海市营企业十单位本月起实行保本自给
    武汉市营企业变亏空为盈余
    【新华社上海七日电】鉴于上海市营企业经过半年来的整顿已具备自给条件，上海市人民政府决定自四月份起不再由市库贴补上海市营企业，包括公共交通公司、市轮渡公司、浦东及沪西自来水厂、吴淞煤气厂等十个单位。在解放初期这些企业由于遭受国民党反动派长期腐败的管理和溃退前的掠夺、破坏，大多呈瘫痪状态。吴淞煤气厂的三十个炉窑，经匪军盘据后全部冷裂。各企业的流动资金普遍枯竭，以致开始恢复生产初期，都得靠市人民政府给以补贴。据统计，去年六月至十二月对各企业的贴补数量即占到市库总支出百分之一○·六二，为市财政的重要支出之一。过去国民党反动统治时期，上海市营企业均依靠各种不合理变相补贴维持营业。如公共交通公司在一九四九年上海未解放时，即是靠伪中央银行的贷款，囤积汽油渔利。解放后，各市营企业逐步改造了臃肿的官僚机构。吴淞煤气厂经过取消厂外的总管理处，管理机构由原来的四科二室裁减为三室二科，原来的市中心办事处缩小范围为营业所等措施后，大大加强了管理效率，并节约了开支。各企业在改造过程中，并依靠工人实行节约，提高生产效率。特别是公共交通公司自去年十月起开始推行了负责制后，过去每辆汽车每加仑汽油平均只能行驶六公里多，现在平均可驶十至十一公里，最高的达十四公里多。最近以“白煤”代替汽油的试验已经成功，用“白煤”较用汽油时，燃料成本可减低百分之八五·七。经过半年的努力和改造，上海市各市营企业创造了保本自给的基本条件。上海市政府乃决定自四月份起各市营企业不再由市库贴补。
    【新华社汉口九日电】由于降低成本的努力获得成效，武汉市营企业已做到自给且有盈余。既济水电公司二月份盈余十八亿一千七百余万元。轮渡管理处以厂养厂，八个月来修理了轮船五只、趸船二只，基本上保证了市内的水上交通。公共汽车管理处已弥补了过去的亏空。武汉染织厂除开支四十台布机的修复费用外仍有盈余。由于国民党统治下企业管理工作腐败，上述企业在解放后也曾经历了一段赔钱生产的阶段。汉口化工厂解放前长期停工，靠出卖机器维持员工生活；武汉染织厂一百台织布机，仅有十七台可以开动。解放之初，各企业营业亏空现象亦未能克服，公共汽车管理处在去年五、六月间亏空合中等机米五十四万斤。既济水电公司六、七月间的亏空数是大米一百五十万斤。为改变这一情况，武汉市营各企业曾为降低成本、节省原料、提高产量作了很大的努力。武汉市公共汽车管理处即因改装木炭炉，燃料成本较用汽油时节省百分之七十，又因自制机油降低润料费百分之五十。既济水电公司每度电的耗煤量减少了○·五八公斤，电的漏耗比解放前减少百分之六十。水的漏耗则减少百分之二十。轮渡管理处每艘渡轮一小时的耗煤量减少了三分之一弱。华中造纸厂产量增加，燃煤消耗反而减少。由于这些努力的结果，市营各企业便逐步从亏空做到盈余。
