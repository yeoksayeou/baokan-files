Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the Central People's Government's State Council, today issued a statement regarding the bombing and destruction of seven of China's civil aviation aircraft in Hong Kong, stating: The Hong Kong government bears full and direct responsibility for the bombing and destruction of seven Chinese civil aviation aircraft within the Hong Kong government's military restricted zone, guarded by British police. Since January 13th of this year, when the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government instructed Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation, to go to Hong Kong to take over the assets of the two airlines, the Hong Kong government has, on the one hand, obstructed our civil aviation aircraft from taking off and returning to China; on the other hand, it has not truly taken responsibility for protecting these Chinese civil aviation aircraft parked in the Hong Kong military restricted zone, thereby enabling this act of sabotage by bandits to occur. Therefore, the Hong Kong government should bear full and direct responsibility for the losses suffered by our country this time, and should immediately hand over all the assets of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation in Hong Kong entirely to the personnel entrusted by the Civil Aviation Administration of our Central People's Government to handle. While the aircraft and all assets of the two airlines are still in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government shall continue to bear full responsibility for their protection.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Our civil aviation aircraft, which have been unable to take off and return to China due to the Hong Kong government's obstruction, were bombed and destroyed by bandits with time bombs at various times between 5:50 AM and 8:15 AM on the 2nd. The incident occurred in the Hong Kong government's military restricted zone north of runway 07 at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, which is guarded by British police and where our two airlines' employee security team is not allowed to approach. The seven aircraft destroyed were those of China National Aviation Corporation under the jurisdiction of our Civil Aviation Administration: C-46 type No. 116, 120, 122, 136 and C-47 type No. 119, 111, 127. According to Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation, they were ordered by our Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government on January 13th to go to Hong Kong to take over all the assets of the two airlines, but due to the obstruction of the Hong Kong government, they have not been able to make the two airlines' aircraft take off and return to China.

　　我国留港民航机七架被毁
    周总理兼外长发表声明   
    香港政府无理阻难我民航飞机起飞回国，应对此次事件负完全直接责任。
    【新华社三日讯】我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理兼外长，今日就我国民航飞机在港被炸毁事发表声明称：我国民航飞机七架，在由英警负责警卫的香港政府军事禁区内被炸毁事件，香港政府应负完全直接责任。自今年一月十三日我中央人民政府民航局指令中国航空公司总经理刘敬宜、中央航空公司总经理陈卓林赴港接收两航资产以来，香港政府一方面阻难我国民航飞机起飞回国；另一方面又不真正负责保护这批停在香港军事禁区内的我国民航飞机，因而使这次匪徒的破坏得以进行。因此香港政府应对此次我国所受损失担负完全直接责任，并应立即将中国航空公司和中央航空公司所有在港的资产，完全交由我中央人民政府民航局委托的人员处理。在两航公司飞机及其一切资产尚在香港期间，香港政府仍应对之负保护的全责。
    【新华社三日讯】因香港政府阻难至今未能起飞回国的我国民航飞机，于二日上午五时五十分至八时十五分间，被匪徒用计时炸弹炸毁了七架。出事地点在英警负责警卫并不准我两航员工纠察队接近的香港启德机场零七号跑道北香港政府军事禁区内。被炸毁的七架飞机是我国民航局所辖中国航空公司的：Ｃ——４６式１１６号，１２０号，１２２号，１３６号及Ｃ——４７式１１９号，１１１号，１２７号。按中国航空公司总经理刘敬宜，中央航空公司总经理陈卓林，于一月十三日即奉我中央人民政府民航局令前往香港接收两航所有资产，但由于香港政府的阻难，迄今未能使两航飞机起飞回国。
