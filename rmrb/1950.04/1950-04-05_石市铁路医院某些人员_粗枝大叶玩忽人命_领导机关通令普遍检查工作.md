　　Certain Personnel at Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital
    Careless and Neglect Human Life
    Leading Organs Issue Circular Ordering Universal Inspection of Work
    The Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau conducted inspections of work style, safety equipment, epidemic prevention, and health care from February 27th to March 8th, discovering many serious problems; particularly the irresponsibility and negligence in medical treatment, leading to the serious phenomenon of neglecting human life. Nurse Rong Aizhi, on March 6th, when giving an infant an injection of "Su'erna Sibo Shuang" (transliteration), did not clearly read the prescription and mistakenly injected six cc, the dosage for an adult, instead of the one cc that was prescribed, almost causing death. Doctor Zhao Zhong, when treating the child of Commissioner Han of the Shijiazhuang Special District Administrative Office, intentionally misused medication, causing injury to the child (after confirmation through investigation, he has been sent to the Shijiazhuang Municipal Court for handling). Other phenomena, such as forgetting to write the age, writing the wrong gender, incomplete drug names, or prescribing too much or too little medication, have occurred more than twenty times in the internal medicine department alone from December of last year to the present. The pharmacy's work is extremely unsound. Some medicine bottles have no labels, leading to the wrong medicine being dispensed. On February 25th, pharmacist Wang Cibi mistakenly gave potassium bromide instead of potassium iodide to the Yangquan Clinic. In addition, there is a lack of responsibility in the use and storage of equipment, causing great losses to people's property. The microtome in the laboratory was rusty; Doctor Fu Guangrui carelessly damaged a general anesthesia machine during an operation on February 2nd; and nurse Guo Shaoling forgot to unplug the electric stove after using it, causing a hot water bottle to explode.
    In order to further improve the health care work of the bureau, the Party and government leading organs of the Railway Bureau have issued a circular to all affiliated hospitals and clinics, using the Shijiazhuang Hospital as a warning, to immediately launch a universal inspection of work.

　　石市铁路医院某些人员
    粗枝大叶玩忽人命
    领导机关通令普遍检查工作
    太原铁路局石家庄铁路医院，于二月二十七日至三月八日，进行检查工作作风、安全设备、防疫保健等工作，发现了不少严重问题；特别是医务治疗上的不负责任、疏忽，致发生玩忽人命的严重现象。护士荣爱芝，在三月六日给婴孩注射苏儿那斯波霜（译音）时，不看清处方，误将应注射一西西，竟按成年注射量，给注射了六西西，险伤人命。医师赵钟，在给石家庄专区行政专署韩专员的小孩看病时，竟故意错用药品，致伤人命（检查确实后，已送石市法院处理）。其他如开处方时，忘写年龄、错写性别、药名不全、或配药份量过多、过少等现象，只内一科统计，自去年十二月至现在即有二十余次。药房工作极不健全。有的药瓶没瓶签，发错了药。发司药王赐表，二月二十五日发给阳泉诊疗所的碘化钾，竟错给成嗅化钾。另外，在器械使用保管上，责任心差，使人民财产受到很大的损失。化验室的切片机竟生了锈；医生傅光瑞二月二日作手术时，不慎将一部全身麻醉器损坏；护士郭绍玲用完电炉忘摘插消，而将火瓶烧炸。
    路局党、政领导机关，为进一步把本路局保健卫生工作做好，特通令所属医院诊所，以石家庄医院为殷鉴，即刻普遍开展检查工作。（太原铁路局总务处通讯组张敬光）
    （对以上问题的处理情况和具体改进办法，希望太原铁路局总务处通讯组继续报导。——编者）
