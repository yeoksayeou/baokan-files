Railway Materials Should Be Turned Over to the Public
To the Editor:

South of Guandao Li Town Village in the Sixth District of Ji County, there are two long sections of abandoned rails that no one is guarding. As far as I know, during the counter-offensive in 1945, when we attacked and destroyed the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railway, due to the circumstances at the time, the government transferred railway materials, rails, sleepers, screws, etc., to the countryside. In 1948, when the government was building the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railway, it called for all railway materials to be turned over to the public. Many regions have already turned over these materials, but some villages have ignored this. Guandao Li Town is one such example. In addition, Fanjiā Village in the same district made a bridge with railway tracks, which is also wrong.

### 铁道器材应该缴公

　　铁道器材应该缴公编辑同志：
    冀县六区官道李镇村南边，抛弃着两根很长的铁轨，没人保管。据我所知，一九四五年大反攻时突击破石德铁路时，因环境关系，政府曾将铁道器材、道轨、枕木、螺丝等均转移农村。四八年政府修建石德路时，曾号召铁道器材应一律缴公。不少地区均已将这种器材缴了公，但还有的村庄置之不理。如官道李镇就是如此。此外该区范家庄用铁轨架了桥，也是错误的。
