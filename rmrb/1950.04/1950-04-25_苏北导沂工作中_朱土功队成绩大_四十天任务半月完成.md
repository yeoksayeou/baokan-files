　　Subei Guide-Yi Work
    Great Achievements of Zhu Tugong Team
    Forty-Day Task Completed in Half a Month

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Zhu Tugong Youth Team of the Guide-Yi Labor Team in Waqi District (severely affected area), Shuyang County, Subei, completed the 41-day river-digging task in 16 days. Each laborer received an average of 400 catties of grain, achieving the goal of work-for-relief for the disaster victims.

    The Zhu Tugong Youth Team has a total of 16 people, including two Communist Party members and three Youth League members. The Party and League members played an exemplary role in the team's daily life and in digging and pushing mud. Zhu Tugong got up before dawn every day, and only after fetching water and cooking rice, did he wake up the laborers. He took care of the whole team like an older brother. The laborers also established a "five-fast" plan for going to work, getting up, eating, digging mud, and pushing mud, competing with each other. Each laborer in the team has a cart and a shovel, and they "load the mud themselves and push it themselves," not wasting any manpower. Zhu Tugong often said to the laborers: "Chairman Mao led us to turn ourselves over, and now he lets us dredge the Da Yi River, using work as relief. The benefits to us are endless! We must make a good example!" His words encouraged the team's confidence in self-salvation, so they completed their task ahead of schedule.

　　苏北导沂工作中
    朱土功队成绩大
    四十天任务半月完成
    【本报讯】苏北沭阳县瓦基区（重灾区）导沂民工大队朱土功青年小队，十六天完成了四十一天的挖河任务，每个民工平均得粮四百斤，灾民达到了以工代赈的目的。
    朱土功青年小队，共有十六个人，内有两个共产党员，三个青年团员。党、团员们在该小队的日常生活与挖泥、推泥工作中，均起了模范带头作用。朱土功每天天不亮就起床，等挑好水、煮好饭，才叫醒全队民工，他像老大哥一般照顾着全队人。民工们还订了上工、起身、吃饭、挖泥、推泥五快计划，互相竞赛着。全队的每个民工都有一辆小车和一把锹，他们作到“自己上泥、自己推”，不让浪费一点人力。朱土功经常对民工们说：“毛主席领导我们翻了身，又让我们扒大沂河，以工代赈，对我们的好处是说不尽呵！我们一定得作出个样子来。”他的话鼓舞了全队民工的自救信心，所以他们提前完成了自己的任务。（中共沭阳县委会陈士良、方学潜）
