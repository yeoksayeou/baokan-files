　　Huguan Shuzhang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shanxi, Expands Services for Production; Significant Increase in Members and Funds

　　[Our Newspaper] The Huguan Shuzhang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi, after a long period of operational exploration and leadership from higher levels, has gradually improved and gained the support of the masses, with significant increases in members and funds. This village cooperative was established as early as the winter of 1943. At that time, only 58 households were shareholders, accounting for 14.6 percent of the village's total households. Over the past six years, although the cooperative played a certain role in organizing mass production, it stagnated in business operations for a long time due to the pursuit of profit, and an unclear understanding of serving members and how to serve them, which caused dissatisfaction among members. It was not until after the county-wide cooperative representatives meeting in July last year that the business direction was further clarified, and the erroneous view of purely seeking profits began to be reversed, embarking on the path of supply and marketing. Furthermore, with the support of the state-owned economy, the cooperative began to correctly grasp the supply and marketing policy. Based on the needs of the members, it carried out supply and marketing operations, promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and organized member production. As a result, members changed from a wait-and-see attitude to actively joining as shareholders. Currently, the number of shareholder households has expanded to 261, accounting for more than 66 percent of the village's total households, and the share capital in millet has also increased from three shi at the time of initial establishment to 61 shi.

　　The cooperative's experience in organizing member production through supply and marketing, strengthening and improving the supply and marketing cooperative is as follows:

　　1. Organize member production through the organization of urban and rural material exchange. First, solve the difficulties of members' lives and means of production. Second, master the principle of buying cheap and selling dear for members. In the past six months, the cooperative supplied members with 3,586 chi of homespun cloth, 145 jin of cotton, 2,820 jin of edible salt, 190 jin of kerosene, and more than 250 pieces of farm tools. In addition, there were daily necessities such as white flour, matches, and medicines. Compared with market prices, members saved more than 20 shi of millet in total. In addition, it helped members sell 2,657 jin of hemp skin, 6,100 jin of medicinal materials, and other items such as eggs. Members sold millet for more than eight shi than market prices. This not only reduced exploitation and increased profits for members, but more importantly, it opened up sales channels for rural sideline products and increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The members responded extremely well, and many non-members have requested to join as shareholders.

　　2. The cooperative and brother cooperatives, and members used the "contract management" method to organize member production. For example, last winter, the cooperative withdrew a portion of its funds and signed a coal contract with the Changxing Cooperative in the fourth district (a brother cooperative), organizing members to transport coal. In three months, a total of 170,000 jin of coal were transported, making a profit of 6,800 jin of millet.

　　3. According to the season, shift the focus of supply and marketing, and carry out organized and planned supply and marketing. For example, at the beginning of this year, according to the requirements of the members, it formulated a plan to solve the difficulties of means of production for members in spring plowing as early as possible. First, it decided to buy back manure forks and manure buckets, organize iron and woodworking craftsmen to repair and make farm tools, and had six carpenters rush to make 60 manure buckets (which can save one shi of millet compared to mass self-sufficiency) and an iron stove. The cooperative also sent special personnel to Changzhi, Dazhang, Yincheng and other places to order 275 various farm tools for members. In addition to mobilizing the masses to adjust seeds on their own, the cooperative is responsible for adjusting two shi of spring barley seeds and 1,000 jin of turnips, and plans to buy 2,000 jin of ferrous sulfate and 200 jin of asphalt for pest control.

　　山西壶关树掌村供销社服务生产扩展业务
    社员与资金均显著增加
    【本报讯】山西壶关树掌村供销社，经过经营业务的长期摸索和上级的领导，已逐渐健全和受到群众的拥护，社员和资金均显著增加。该村社远在一九四三年冬即成立。当时入股仅五十八户，占全村总户数的百分之一四·六。六年来该社在组织群众生产上虽曾起了一定作用，但由于追逐利润观点的作祟，对为社员服务及如何服务的观点不明确，在业务经营上长期停滞不前，引起社员不满。自经去年七月全县合作社代表会议后，才进一步明确了业务方向，开始扭转单纯营利的错误观点，走上供销道路。并由于国营经济的扶持，该社始正确的掌握了供销政策。根据社员需要开展供销业务，推进城乡物资交流，同时组织了社员生产。因之使得社员由观望态度转为积极入股。现该社入股户数已扩大到二百六十一户，占全村总户数百分之六十六以上，股金小米也已由初成立时之三石增至六十一石。
    该社通过供销，组织社员生产，壮大并健全了供销社的经验如下：
    一、从组织城乡物资交流中组织社员生产。首先解决社员生活与生产资料的困难。其次是掌握了对社员买贵卖贱的方针。半年来，该社共供应社员土布三千五百八十六尺、棉花一百四十五斤、食盐二千八百二十斤、煤油一百九十斤、农具二百五十余件。此外还有白面、火柴、药品等日用品。与市价相比，社员共便宜了小米二十余石。另外给社员推销了麻皮二千六百五十七斤、药材六千一百斤、还有鸡蛋等物品。社员比市价多卖小米八石多。不仅使社员少受剥削多获利润，而且更重要的是给农村副产品打开了销路，提高了群众生产的积极性。社员反映极好，许多非社员纷纷要求入股。
    二、该社和兄弟社，社员间运用了“合同经营”方法组织社员生产。如去冬该社抽出资金一部分与四区常行社（兄弟社）双方订立煤炭合同，组织社员运输，三个月共运出煤炭十七万斤，获利小米六千八百斤。
    三、根据季节，转移供销重点，进行有组织、有计划的供销，如今年初，就根据社员要求，及早订出了解决社员春耕生产中生产资料困难的计划。首先决定买回粪杈、粪桶，组织铁、木工匠修打农具，由六个木匠赶作粪桶六十付（比群众自置可省米一石）及铁炉一个。该社并派专人到长治、大掌、荫城一带给社员订购各种农具二百七十五件。此外在调剂种籽上，除发动群众自行调剂外，合作社负责调剂春大麦籽二石、蔓菁一千斤、并计划买黑矾二千斤、柏油二百斤，以备杀虫。
