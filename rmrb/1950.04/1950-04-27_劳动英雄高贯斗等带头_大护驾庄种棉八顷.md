Labor Hero Gao Guandou and Others Take the Lead
Da Hujia Village Plants Eight Acres of Cotton

[Report from this newspaper] Hebei Daily News: Gao Guandou, a labor hero from Da Hujia Village in Shen County, has assisted village cadres in leading the entire village to successfully complete the cotton planting plan. The village has 542 households and 7,000 mu of land, and plans to plant 800 mu of cotton this year. Gao Guandou assisted the village cadres in formulating a specific plan, and convened various meetings of party members, people's representatives, village cadres, and citizen groups to convey the significance of cotton planting. All village cadres and eighty-three party members, in conjunction with sixty-three experienced farmers and ninety-six activists from agricultural mutual aid groups, carried out extensive publicity and mobilization work by dividing into areas, groups, and households. Citizen group meetings were held universally, and party members, cadres, and experienced farmers played leading roles. By using concrete accounting methods, a mass-based mutual assistance campaign was launched, creating a cotton planting upsurge. Gao Guandou himself planted eight mu of cotton, and also mobilized sixty-three households to plant an additional 43.5 mu, and promoted 2,200 jin of improved cotton seeds. In the beginning, some households were afraid of planting too much cotton, worrying about not having enough feed for their livestock or fuel for cooking. Gao Guandou repeatedly explained to the masses that with cotton, nothing would be lacking. Sun Zhenjiang's mother was worried about not knowing how to manage cotton fields. Gao Ergang persuaded her, saying, "Don't worry, I'll teach you." So she planted more than one mu. Gao Shuangyue had doubts about the government's cotton price policy. Gao Dongchen explained to him three times that the government's cotton price policy was to guarantee the interests of cotton farmers and reward cotton planting, and that the masses would not suffer losses. After Gao Shuangyue understood the idea, he also planted 2.5 mu. In Majia Street, which has only forty-odd households, more than seventy mu of cotton were planted in alkaline land.

During sowing, in addition to the original ninety-six mutual aid groups (387 households), more than one hundred households organized temporary sowing mutual aid groups. The entire village had only six cotton seed drills, and they were all arranged two or three days in advance, deciding who would use them first and who would use them later. Those who couldn't get a drill used dibbling. The six drills went to the fields early every day and didn't return home until late at night, making sure that the machines were always in use. The mutual aid group of Wu Ni and Zhenshui used the drill at night when they couldn't get it during the day, planting three mu by lantern light. By April 18, more than 400 households had planted 830 mu of cotton. After the rain, the masses planned to plant more than 100 mu, and they are currently rushing to plant.

　　劳动英雄高贯斗等带头
    大护驾庄种棉八顷
    【本报讯】河北日报消息：深县大护驾庄劳动英雄高贯斗，协助村干部领导全村已经胜利完成了种棉计划。该村五百四十二户七千亩地，今年计划种棉八百亩。高贯斗协助村干部订出具体计划，召开了党员、人民代表、村干、公民小组各种会议，把种棉意义贯彻下去。全村干部和八十三个党员，结合六十三个老农，及九十六个农业互助组的积极分子，具体分片、分组、分户广泛的开展了宣传动员工作。普遍召开了公民小组会，党员、干部、老农都起了带头作用。用具体算账的方式，开展了群众性的互助，造成了种棉热潮。高贯斗自己种了八亩棉花，还动员了六十三户，多种棉花四十三亩半，推广了二千二百斤良棉种。开头有些户怕多种棉，牲口没喂的，做饭没烧的。高贯斗反复向群众说明有了棉花什么也缺不了。孙振江他娘发愁种棉花不会修理，高二刚劝她说：“不要紧，我教给你。”于是就多种了一亩多。高双月对政府的棉价政策有怀疑，高东臣曾三次和他解释政府的棉价政策是保证棉农利益、奖励种棉的，不能让群众吃亏。高双月搞通思想后，也种上了二亩半。只四十多户的马家街，就在碱地里种了七十多亩棉花。
    在播种当中，除原有的九十六个互助组（三百八十七户）外，又有一百多户组织了临时播种互助组。全村仅有六张耩棉花的大耧，都是头两三天就掂对好，谁先使谁后使，摸不着使的就刨坑点种。六张耧每天一早下地，晚上大黑了才能回家，作到人闲耧不闲。五妮和振水的互助组，白天摸不着使耧，就晚上使，打着灯笼种了三亩。到四月十八日，四百多户已种上八百三十亩棉花。落雨以后，群众又计划多种一百多亩，眼下正在抢种。
