Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to reports from various locations, the national grain procurement work for 1949 is nearing completion. The 1949 public grain collection work, although encountering various difficulties due to the weak working foundation in the vast new areas and the long-term destruction and varying degrees of disasters suffered by many regions from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits; under the high patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants and the efforts of cadres at all levels, the arduous task was finally completed. As of the end of March, according to incomplete statistics (reports from the southwestern provinces have not yet been fully submitted), the national average has completed 90% of the total procurement task; among them, the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest have all exceeded the targets, such as the Northeast completing 104%, exceeding the target by 200,000 tons; Inner Mongolia completed 105%, and the Northwest completed 113%; the earliest to complete were Songjiang Province and Chahar Province, both of which had fully completed the grain procurement work by the end of last December.

During the grain procurement, peasants, rural Communist Party members, and Youth League members in various places demonstrated countless vivid exemplary actions. In particular, the peasants in the old liberated areas, who have a glorious tradition of supporting the Liberation War, were even more willing to pay and overpay public grain quickly, inspired by the national victory. For example, in the Northeast, under the resounding slogan of "Support the liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet! Support industrial construction!", the public grain delivered by seventy counties and cities exceeded the original national quota. In North China, Shandong and other places, when paying public grain, many peasants dried and winnowed the grain, and selected the best to deliver to the warehouse. In the new areas, due to the initial unfolding of various rural social reforms, the awareness of the vast number of peasants gradually increased, and countless touching grain payment deeds were similarly produced. In Xianju County and Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, peasants beat gongs and drums and sent grain to the granary collectively in groups. An old woman in Puqian Village, Tiantai County, said to the county head: "In the past, when delivering grain to the Kuomintang, we came with tears in our eyes. This time, we are paying grain to celebrate our emancipation and victory, and we are coming with Yangko dances!" In the Southern Jiangsu area, peasants united dozens or hundreds of boats to transport public grain to the warehouse, and also enthusiastically assisted the government in urging landlords who were in arrears to pay grain, inspecting the grain color, and helping to weigh it.

During the procurement process, local governments generally paid attention to the peasants' burden level and fairness and rationality, and in particular, provided appropriate reductions and exemptions for disaster areas according to the severity of the disaster. For example, many areas in the Northeast conducted surveys of disaster areas and correctly implemented the reduction and exemption policies in the Grain Procurement Regulations of the Northeast People's Government. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province, approximately one million mu of severely affected areas in the province were granted full exemption. In the entire administrative region of Northern Jiangsu, the amount of grain reduced or exempted due to crop failure reached 350 million jin, and 50 million jin of cotton seeds.

Old Liberated Areas Universally Implement Proportional Tax, Reasonable Burden Wins Mass Support

In the process of procurement, in the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, a proportional tax has been universally implemented to encourage peasants to become rich, and this tax law is simple and easy to implement, and has won the support of the masses. For example, in order to make the burden reasonable in various parts of the Northeast, all paid attention to grasping the normal annual output of land and the land grades, and some also adjusted the land grades and investigated the black land, so that the burden on peasants in the entire region was relatively reduced to only about 18% of the normal annual output. Most counties in North China discussed and arranged the autumn procurement work through people's representative meetings. Some places in Chahar and Hebei provinces, in addition to doing a good job in propaganda and mobilization and organization, also adopted the method of awarding autumn procurement models, and launched a wave of early payment and good payment of public grain. In the newly liberated areas, in order to adapt to the different affordability of various classes, the People's Government implemented a progressive tax law, and initially implemented a reasonable burden policy, so that the vast number of peasants in the new areas were liberated from the thousands of years of unreasonable burden system for the first time. However, because some places in the new areas have not yet implemented rent reduction, the peasants have not been widely mobilized; although some places have been liberated for some time, the forces of bandits and bullies in the countryside have not been completely eliminated, and the lower-level government has not been thoroughly transformed, so the landlords can collude with the old Baojia personnel to hide a large number of fields and transfer the burden to the peasants on the one hand; on the other hand, they deliberately clamor that the burden is too heavy and resist the grain procurement movement. According to reliable investigations in various places: Judging from the living conditions after the burden, most landlords are still better off than peasants, except for individual small landlords without labor. According to a typical investigation in four regions of Jiande and Jiaxing in Zhejiang, and Heyeuan Township and Pengbo Township in Suichuan County, Jiangxi: The average surplus grain per person for landlords is generally still three times that of the poor peasants and more than twice that of the middle peasants.

Launching Anti-Black Land Movement in New Areas is Key to Completing Procurement Work

Therefore, in the new areas, paying attention to mobilizing the masses, combined with the work of opposing bandits, opposing bullies, and reducing rents, and launching an anti-black land movement, is the main key to whether the procurement work can be carried out smoothly. For example, in Taiyang Township, Wangjiahe District, Huangpi, Hubei, through the peasant representative meeting, the big bully Zhang Hongli, who took the lead in concealing land, was struggled against, and more than 30 dan of black land and 184 guns from the fake township office were found. Encouraged by the victory, the peasants paid off the public grain within two days. Experience has proved that it is wrong for some areas to regard grain procurement as unrelated to mobilizing the masses and carry it out in isolation. The second main experience of procurement is to discuss democratically through the representative meetings of all sectors of society and the peasant representative meetings, widely absorb the opinions of the masses and people from all walks of life, study and grasp various situations, and obtain the help of the masses, which can solve many difficult problems. Facts in various places have shown that the results are good when doing this, and bad when doing the opposite. The third experience is to fully utilize and transform old field materials, order old bookkeepers (personnel in charge of land tax during the Chiang Kai-shek era) to hand over and clean up old tax registers, and mobilize the masses to correct them, carry out anti-black land movements, and correct the past phenomena of having land without grain and having grain without land, so that the burden tends to be reasonable.

During the procurement process, some areas initially had too few and weak cadres, and the leadership did not grasp the policies well enough, and many deviations occurred. For example, some areas did not correctly carry out the anti-black land struggle, and the peasants' burden was heavy; some areas did not sort out and utilize the old tax registers, but implemented re-registration, so that landlords could take the opportunity to deceive peasants and conceal a large amount of land, affecting the procurement task and also increasing the burden on peasants; also, some areas had a small burden surface, and the burden on landlords and rich peasants was particularly heavy, and they could not grasp the reasonable and legal struggle against landlords; in addition, many district and township cadres in many areas showed a compulsory command style, arbitrarily detaining and beating people, which caused a certain loss to the work. Although these deviations have been or are being corrected during the procurement process, they are still worthy of high attention from cadres in various places.

At present, the production movement has been launched in various places. How to quickly clear up the outstanding public grain arrears, correct and remedy the shortcomings and errors in the procurement, and end the procurement work in a timely manner so that it does not affect the spring plowing of the peasants should become a matter of great attention to cadres in various places. At the same time, after the public grain is stored in the warehouse in various places, strictly paying attention to the storage work and ensuring that state property is not subject to any loss is an even greater and more glorious task for food workers and all the people.

### 农民表现高度爱国热情踊跃缴纳  全国征粮接近完成  东北、内蒙、西北均超过任务

　　农民表现高度爱国热情踊跃缴纳
    全国征粮接近完成
    东北、内蒙、西北均超过任务
    【新华社十三日讯】据各地报告，全国一九四九年度征粮工作已接近完成。一九四九年度的公粮征收工作，虽因广大新区工作基础薄弱，许多地区又遭受蒋匪的长期破坏和轻重不等的灾害，遇到种种困难；但在农民的高度爱国热情和各级干部的努力下，终于完成了艰巨的任务。迄三月底止，根据不完全的统计（西南各省报告尚未全部送来），全国平均已完成征收总任务百分之九十；其中东北、内蒙、西北并均超过了任务，如东北完成了百分之一百零四，超过任务二十万吨；内蒙完成了百分之一百零五，西北完成了百分之一百十三；完成最早的是松江省和察哈尔省，该两省在去年十二月底即已全部结束征粮工作。
    在征粮中，各地农民及中共农村党员青年团员表现出了无数的生动的模范行动，特别是有着支援解放战争光荣传统的老区农民，在全国胜利形势鼓舞下，更是纷纷自愿快缴和多缴公粮。如东北在“支援解放台湾、海南岛、西藏！支援工业建设！”的响亮口号下，有七十个县市所交公粮超过国家原定数目；华北山东等地农民在缴公粮时，不少农民都把粮食晒干簸净，拣最好的送缴入库。在新区，由于各种农村社会改革的初步展开，广大农民的觉悟逐渐提高，同样产生无数动人的缴粮事迹。浙江省的仙居县和天台县，农民们都是打锣打鼓、成群结队地集体送粮入仓。天台县铺前村一个老大娘对该县县长说：“以前给国民党送粮，都是流着泪来的，这次是给自己缴翻身粮、胜利粮，是扭着秧歌来的！”苏南地区农民用数十数百条船联合起来，运送公粮入库，并且还热情地协助政府向拖缴的地主催粮，检查粮色，帮助过秤。
    征收中，各地政府一般注意到农民的负担程度和公平合理，特别是对灾区一般都按灾情轻重，予以分别的适当的减免。如东北不少地区对灾区作了调查，正确执行了东北人民政府征粮条例中的减免政策，据黑龙江省统计：全省约一百万亩重灾区获得全部免征。而在苏北全行政区，因歉收而减免的粮额达三亿五千万斤，籽花五千万斤。
    老区普遍施行比例税合理负担获群众拥护
    在征收过程中，在土地改革业已完成的老区，普遍施行了比例税，鼓励农民发家致富，而且这种税法简便易行，获得群众的拥护。如东北各地为了使负担合理，均切实注意到掌握土地常年应产量和地级、有的并进行了调整地级、查黑地的工作，使全区农民负担相对地减轻至仅占常年产量百分之十八左右。华北大部县份均通过人民代表会议讨论布置秋征工作，察哈尔、河北省有些地方，除作好宣传动员和组织工作外，并采用了评奖秋征模范的方法，展开了早缴和缴好公粮的热潮。在新解放区，人民政府为了适应各阶层不同的负担能力，施行累进税法，初步实行了合理负担政策，使广大新区农民第一次从几千年不合理的负担制度下解放出来。但因新区有些地方尚未实行减租，农民未普遍发动；有些地方虽解放了一些时日，而农村中土匪恶霸势力尚未完全肃清，下层政权尚未彻底改造，因而地主得以勾结旧保甲人员，一面隐瞒大量田亩，转嫁负担给农民；一面故意叫嚣负担过重，对抗征粮运动。据各地确实调查：以负担后生活论，除个别无劳动力的小地主外，大部地主仍比农民为好，据浙江建德、嘉兴及江西遂川县禾源乡、鹏博乡四个地区典型调查：地主每人平均余粮一般仍为贫民三倍、中农二倍以上。
    新区开展反黑田运动是完成征收工作关键
    因之，新区各地征收中，注意发动群众，结合反对土匪、反对恶霸、减租等工作，开展反黑田运动，是征收工作能否顺利开展的主要关键。如湖北黄陂王家河区太阳乡通过农民代表会，斗争了带头瞒田的大恶霸张鸿砺，即查出黑田三十多石，缴出伪乡公所枪一百八十四支。农民们在胜利鼓舞下，二天内就缴齐了公粮。经验证明：有些地区把征粮看作与发动群众无关、孤立地进行是错误的。征收的第二个主要经验是通过各界代表会和农民代表会，民主讨论，广泛吸收群众及各界人士意见，将各种情况都加以研究掌握，得到群众帮助，可以解决不少困难问题。各地事实都说明：这样作的，成绩就好，反之就坏。第三个经验是充分利用和改造旧田亩材料，命令旧册书（蒋匪时代管田赋人员）缴出与清理旧赋册，并发动群众加以校正，开展反黑田运动，改正过去有地无粮、有粮无地等现象，使负担趋于合理。
    征收过程中，也有一些地区，最初因干部又少又弱，领导掌握政策不够，出现了不少偏差。如有些地区没有正确地进行反黑田斗争，农民负担重；有的地区没有整理和利用旧赋册，而实行重新登记，以致地主得以乘机欺骗农民，大量瞒田，影响征收任务，同样也加重农民负担；也有些地区因负担面小，地主富农负担特重，并且不能掌握对地主的合理合法斗争；另有不少地区的区乡干部表现了强迫命令的作风，随意扣人打人，均使工作受到一定的损失。这些偏差在征收中虽经过纠正或正在纠正，但仍值各地干部高度注意。
    目前各地生产运动已经展开，如何迅速清理公粮尾欠，纠正和补救征收当中的缺点和错误，及时结束征收工作，使其不致影响农民春耕，应成为各地干部十分注意的事情。同时，各地公粮入库后，严密注意保管工作，保证国家财产不受任何损失，又是食粮工作人员及全体人民的更重大更光荣的任务。
