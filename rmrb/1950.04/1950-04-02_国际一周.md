    A New Stage in the Peace Movement
    The report of the Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on March 15, pointed out that almost half of the world's population has participated in the great struggle for peace. The peace movement has entered a new stage of taking practical actions on a global scale to thwart war conspiracies.
    The warmongers have repeatedly rejected proposals for major powers to conclude treaties to strengthen peace, proposals to end colonial wars, and proposals for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. They have refused entry to peace delegations, and even detained and deported them. They are also actively preparing for various wars of aggression. For example, under the auspices of the United States, the North Atlantic aggressive group recently held a series of military conferences in The Hague and London, and adopted military plans for the division of labor among the North Atlantic group countries in launching wars of aggression. Therefore, it is entirely insufficient to generally call for peace today. To this end, the Stockholm Congress passed a solemn resolution, declaring that any government that first uses atomic weapons will be judged a war criminal. This gives a serious warning to the atomic warmongers. The Congress attached particular importance to expanding the organization of the peace movement, calling on national peace committees in all countries, especially national peace committees in capitalist countries, to universally establish local peace committees in major cities and enterprises, so that the propaganda of the peace movement is combined with practical actions, the peace movement is combined with the workers' movement, and all people who ideologically support peace actively participate in the peace movement.
    At present, the working people of Western Europe have bravely taken practical actions against war. Dockworkers in French ports were the first to announce their refusal to unload American ammunition and war materials. This struggle has received the spiritual and material support of other workers and the broad masses of people in France. The first batch of "military aid materials" supplied by the United States to France under the "bilateral agreement" dared not be transported to French ports, but detoured to North Africa. But North African dockworkers also decided to refuse unloading. At the same time, workers in Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and other countries have risen up in response. This heroic struggle against "military aid" has become one of the most active and concrete manifestations of the Western European peace movement.
    The danger of war exists. But there are already powerful forces in the world sufficient to thwart the warmongers' schemes. As long as all peace-loving people in the world unite and take all the most effective ways and take practical actions, they will surely be able to smash the military adventure plans that the warmongers are preparing. Do not beg for peace from the warmongers, but force them to accept peace!
    The So-Called Two Centers of "Asian Policy"
    U.S. imperialism is hurriedly readjusting its Asian aggression policy, which has suffered major defeats, dreaming of continuing to maintain its enslavement of the people of Asian countries.
    The first center of this aggressive policy is to strengthen the Pacific aggression line centered on Japan as a stronghold. This front starts from the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, passes through Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, South Korea, and all the way to the Philippines. With the talks between the warmonger Brett Ray and others and MacArthur in early February, the plan to turn Japan into a permanent base for the United States is being accelerated. The air force bases at Misawa in northern Honshu and Itazuke in southern Kyushu, Japan, have been remodeled. The construction of the Okinawa military base and the Yokosuka naval and air base has been publicly announced to be jointly undertaken by the US occupation authorities and the reactionary Yoshida government. MacArthur has recently attempted to release all Japanese war criminals for various reasons, with the aim of using them as assistants to the United States in preparing for a new war. MacArthur's adviser, Atchison, openly declared: "It is the moral responsibility of the United States to re-militarize Japan." In fact, Japanese factories are already producing munitions, and the core of the Japanese army has been constituted by 500,000 armed police under disguise.
    Within MacArthur's aggression line, U.S. lackey Syngman Rhee signed a so-called "U.S.-Korea Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" with the United States in late January, stipulating that Gimpo Airport and Jeju Island would be used as U.S. military bases, and allowing the United States to set up "military advisory groups" in South Korea for a long time. In the Philippines, in addition to strengthening the original air force base, the United States is secretly building new air force bases in various places. The "US-Philippines Military Assistance Agreement," which enables the United States to control the Philippine defense rights, was announced on March 11 to be extended to 1953. The United States is preparing to transport more "military aid materials" to the Philippines and South Korea. At the same time, the U.S. bases on Pacific islands have been strengthened again and again. Recently, the US House Military Committee passed nearly 700 million yuan in "military public works" funds, most of which will be used to strengthen and build naval and air force bases in Alaska, Okinawa, Guam, Kwajalein Island, and Johnson Island. After the visit to Japan by the four U.S. chiefs of staff at the end of January, the U.S. Seventh Special Fleet in the Western Pacific has been strengthened to "maintain maximum strength."
    The second center of this aggression policy is to fully interfere in the Vietnamese people's war of liberation, in an attempt to prevent the victory of the Vietnamese people's revolution. At present, U.S. imperialism's biggest bet is being placed on the puppet Bao Dai. After the U.S. government announced its recognition of the Bao Dai puppet regime, it transported tanks, artillery, ammunition, and special jungle warfare equipment to the French-occupied areas to support the struggling French aggressive troops. The U.S. occupation authorities established a secret recruitment agency for Japanese officers and soldiers in Japan to organize an "expeditionary force" to go to Vietnam to assist the French army in combat. The so-called "U.S. Economic Mission" led by Griffin arrived in Saigon at the beginning of the month to formulate "emergency recommendations" for directly assisting Bao Dai. The U.S. naval and air forces even brazenly violated Vietnam's territorial waters and airspace, conducting shows of force to intimidate the Vietnamese people and as an expression of support for the puppet regime.
    These aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism have been met with the growing opposition of the Asian people. The Japanese people are launching a broad movement demanding the early signing of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing the United States retaining bases in Japan. The shelling by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army and the demonstrations by student masses in Saigon forced the U.S. naval and air forces, which came to reinforce the French colonialists, to retreat in embarrassment. The Asian people are no longer lambs to be slaughtered. U.S. imperialism has exhausted all its efforts but still cannot prevent the Chinese people from achieving a historic and great victory. What way does it have to prevent the Asian people from achieving the same victory?
    Be Vigilant Against the Spy Sabotage Activities of U.S. Imperialism
    Recent reports show that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its espionage and sabotage activities in Asia as an important part of its aggressive policy.
    According to the Domei News Agency, a spy center in Hong Kong controlled by MacArthur's headquarters is engaged in planning, scheduling, and supervising U.S. and British espionage activities in Chinese territory; spy schools have been established in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan to train large numbers of special agents, attempting to infiltrate the Chinese mainland from Hong Kong. According to the Washington Post, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee has approved the allocation of funds to strengthen "surveillance posts" along the Chinese border. Former U.S. diplomatic officials in China are being transferred to "strategic strongholds" around China to assume important positions. U.S. State Department official Merchant openly declared: "Obviously, we (referring to the U.S. ruling group) cannot forget China with its 450 million people. Because we no longer have our consulates and agencies in that country, the problem of obtaining reliable information and using it as a basis for estimating our policies has become doubly heavy." U.S. intelligence agencies will also carry out activities in Indochina, Burma, Nepal, Kashmir, and other countries.
    The Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ publication revealed in an article as early as February 3 the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to use the Tito clique to engage in espionage activities in Asia. The U.S. State Department plans to turn the Yugoslav embassy in New Delhi into its central intelligence bureau and establish branches in other Asian countries, mixing into communist parties and democratic organizations, carrying out anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda, disintegrating these organizations from within, and sabotaging the revolutionary movements in Asian countries from within.
    It is nothing new for Western imperialist countries, especially U.S. imperialism, to carry out espionage and sabotage activities in the new China. The Wald case in Shenyang can serve as an example. Now, when the forces of U.S. imperialism are driven out of China, it is intensifying these dark deeds of the fifth column. Therefore, the Asian people, especially the Chinese people, must be especially vigilant against the espionage and sabotage activities of U.S. imperialism.

    和平运动的新阶段
    三月十五日在瑞典京城斯德哥尔摩举行的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三届全体会议的报告指出：几乎全世界一半的人口，已经参加了争取和平的伟大斗争。和平运动已经进入以世界性规模的实际行动来挫败战争阴谋的新阶段。
    战争贩子们一再拒绝了关于大国缔结加强和平公约的建议，关于停止殖民战争的建议，关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议。他们拒绝了和平代表团入境，甚至加以拘捕驱逐。他们还正积极进行各项侵略战争的准备工作。例如在美国的主持下，北大西洋侵略集团最近在海牙与伦敦召开了一连串的军事会议，通过了北大西洋集团各国在发动侵略战争时分工的军事计划。因此，今天一般地呼吁和平，是完全不够了。斯德哥尔摩大会为此通过了庄严的决议，宣布任何第一个使用原子武器的政府，将被判定为战争罪犯。这给予原子黩武主义者们以严重的警告。大会特别重视扩大和平运动的组织问题，号召各国和平委员会、首先是资本主义国家的全国性和平委员会，必须在各大城市和各企业，普遍地建立地方和平委员会，使和平运动的宣传与实际行动相结合，使和平运动与工人运动相结合，并使所有在思想上赞成和平的人们积极地参加和平运动。
    目前，西欧劳动人民已经勇敢地采取了反对战争的实际行动。法国港口的码头工人，首先宣布拒绝卸运美国的军火和战争物资。这个斗争获得法国其他工人以及广大人民精神上和物质上的支持。美国根据“双边协定”供给法国的第一批“军援物资”，不敢运往法国港口，而绕道运往北非。但是北非码头工人也决定拒绝卸运。同时意大利、荷兰、比利时、挪威等国工人都纷起响应。这个反“军援”的英勇斗争，已成为西欧保卫和平运动的最积极而具体的表现之一。
    战争的危险性是存在的。但是世界上已有强大的力量足以挫败战争贩子们的计谋。只要全世界一切爱好和平的人们团结起来，并采取各种最有效的方式，采取实际行动，那就一定能够粉碎战争贩子们正在准备中的军事冒险计划。不是向战争贩子们乞求和平，而是要强迫它们接受和平！
    所谓“亚洲政策”的两个重心
    美帝国主义正慌忙地在重新调整其已经遭受重大失败的亚洲侵略政策，梦想继续维持其对亚洲各国人民的奴役。
    这个侵略政策的第一个重心，是加强以日本为中心据点的太平洋侵略线。这一战线自北太平洋的阿留申群岛起，经过日本、琉球群岛、南朝鲜、一直到菲律宾。随着战争贩子布莱特雷等四人二月初与麦克阿瑟的会谈，使日本变为美国永久基地的计划，已在加速进行中。本州北部三泽和日本南部九州板附的空军基地，已改造完成。冲绳岛军事基地和横须贺海空军基地的建筑工程，已公开宣布由美国占领当局与吉田反动政府联合承担。麦克阿瑟最近又企图以各种理由释放全部日本战犯，目的就在于利用它们充当美国准备新战争的助手。麦克阿瑟的顾问艾奇伯格公然宣称：“把日本重新军国主义化，是美国道德上的责任”。事实上，日本的工厂已在生产军火，日本陆军的核心已由伪装下的五十万武装警察构成。
    在麦克阿瑟这个侵略线内，美国走狗李承晚已于一月下旬与美国签订一项所谓“韩美联防互助协定”，规定将金浦飞机场和济州岛作为美国的军事基地，并允许美国在南朝鲜长期设置“军事顾问团”。美国在菲律宾除增强原有的空军基地外，正在各地秘密建筑新空军基地。使美国能控制菲律宾国防权的“美菲军事援助协定”，已于三月十一日宣布延长到一九五三年。美国正准备以更多的“军援物资”运往菲律宾和南朝鲜。同时，美国在太平洋各岛屿的基地，已一再加强。最近美众院军事委员会又通过将近七亿元的“军事公共工程”经费，其中大部分用以加强和建筑阿拉斯加、冲绳岛、关岛、瓜加林岛和约翰逊岛等的海空军基地。而在美国四参谋长一月底访日以后，美国在西太平洋上的第七特种舰队，已被增强到“保持最大限度的实力”。
    这个侵略政策的第二个重心，是对越南人民解放战争作全面的干涉，妄图阻止越南人民革命的胜利。目前美帝国主义最大的赌注正押在傀儡保大的身上。美国政府在宣布承认保大傀儡政权后，即以坦克、大炮、弹药与特殊丛林作战装备运往法占区，支援处境困难的法国侵略军队。美占领当局在日本成立了秘密征募日本官兵的机构，组织“远征兵团”，准备开往越南协助法军作战。由葛里芬所率领的所谓“美国经济使团”，月初抵达西页，拟订了直接援助保大的“紧急建议”。美国的海空军甚至肆无忌惮地侵犯越南的领海领空，举行武力示威，以恫吓越南人民，并作为支持傀儡政权的表示。
    美帝国主义的这些侵略行动，遭到亚洲人民日益增长的反对。日本人民正展开广泛的运动，要求早日签订全面和约，反对美国在日本保留基地。越南人民解放军的炮击和西页学生群众的示威，使增援法国殖民者的美国海空军不得不狼狈撤退。亚洲人民已不是任人宰割的羔羊了。美帝国主义竭尽全力仍不能阻止中国人民取得历史性的伟大胜利，它又有什么办法来阻止亚洲人民取得同样的胜利呢？
    警惕美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动
    最近许多报道显示：美帝国主义正加紧进行对亚洲的间谍破坏活动，作为它的侵略政策的一个重要组成部分。
    据电通社消息，一个由麦克阿瑟总部控制的在香港的间谍中心，正从事计划、调度和监督中国领土上的美英间谍活动；在日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾和台湾设立间谍学校，训练大批特务，企图由香港潜入中国大陆。据华盛顿邮报消息，美众院拨款委员会已批准加强沿中国边境“监视哨”的拨款，原在中国的美国外交官员，正在转派到中国外围的“战略据点”去担任重要职务。美国务院官员麦谦特公然宣称：“很显然，我们（指美国统治集团）不能忘掉有四亿五千万人的中国。因为我们在那个国家内不再有我们的领馆机关，要获得可靠情报并以之作为估计我们政策的根据这个问题，就变成加倍繁重”。美国谍报机关同时将在印度支那、缅甸、尼泊尔、克什米尔以及其它各国进行活动。
    共产党与工人党情报局机关刊早在二月三日所载的一篇专文中，就揭露美帝国主义利用铁托集团在亚洲从事间谍活动的阴谋。美国务院计划把驻在新德里的南斯拉夫大使馆变为它的中央谍报局，并在亚洲其他国家建立支部，混入共产党和民主组织，进行反苏反共的宣传活动，从内部瓦解这些组织，从内部破坏亚洲各国的革命运动。
    西方帝国主义国家特别是美帝国主义在新中国进行间谍破坏活动，已经不是新鲜的事情。沈阳的瓦尔德案，可以作为一个例子。现在当美帝国主义势力被赶出中国的时候，他便更加紧这种第五纵队的黑暗勾当。因此，亚洲人民，首先是中国人民，对于美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动不能不特别提高警惕。
