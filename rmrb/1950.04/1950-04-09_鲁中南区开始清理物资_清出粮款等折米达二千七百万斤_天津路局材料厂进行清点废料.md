　　Lu Zhongnan District Starts Clearing Materials
    Clearing out Grain and Funds Equivalent to 27 Million Jin of Rice
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Materials Factory Conducts Inventory of Scrap Materials
    [This newspaper's report] According to a report from Dazhong Daily on April 3rd: The work of clearing materials in the Lu Zhongnan District has achieved results. According to incomplete statistics from the district administrative office, the two directly subordinate organs of the CPC District Committee, six special districts, and Xin Hailian City, the total value of cleared grain, funds, and estimated materials is approximately equivalent to 27 million jin of grain. Among them are two extremely valuable mineral exploration drilling tools, "Fenghuo" brand drills, worth 1 billion yuan. The machinery and raw materials cleared out by eight factories in Xin Hailian City alone are worth 12 million jin of wheat. The Zaozhuang Coal Mine cleared out a lot of materials, providing favorable conditions for the mine's reconstruction. A significant number of other materials, weapons, and ammunition in various places have not yet been valued. Through this inventory work, the broad masses of cadres have further established the concept of cherishing state property. Ideological examinations have also been conducted on some past wasteful phenomena.
    [This newspaper's report] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: The Materials Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, directly under the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, is carrying out a full-scale inventory of scrap materials in order to implement the State Council's decision to clear out warehouses in enterprises nationwide. It has initially cleared out usable materials equivalent to 779,778 jin of millet. The inventory work began on March 15th and, after 14 days of intense work, completely overturned the scrap materials accumulated for more than ten years during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, transforming them into useful property for the people's motherland. The value of the cleared scrap materials exceeds the total amount of salary expenditures for all 500+ employees of the factory for more than four months. Before the inventory, the factory director took personal responsibility, and a 12-person inventory team was formed. Meetings were held to formulate an inventory plan, and the calculation methods for the weight and quantity of materials were also stipulated. To solve the technical difficulties in the inventory, the methods for identifying the types, shapes, and sizes of materials were repeatedly discussed, and many technicians were consulted to assist in the process. Because this inventory work had thorough preparations and clear regulations in advance, it proceeded relatively quickly. At the same time, each group, during the inventory, demonstrated fearlessness of dirt, mud, and the difficulty of clearing scrap materials from messy piles of iron, thus enabling the work to achieve great results in a short period of time.

　　鲁中南区开始清理物资
    清出粮款等折米达二千七百万斤
    天津路局材料厂进行清点废料
    【本报讯】据大众日报四月三日消息：鲁中南区清理物资工作已获成绩。据该区行署和中共区党委二直属机关及六个专区和新海连市等不完全的统计，清理出之粮款及已估计之物资总值约折粮二千七百万斤，其中有极贵重的探矿井工具风恶洋钻二支，价值十亿元。仅新海连市八个工厂清查出之机器原料即值小麦一千二百万斤。枣庄煤矿清理出很多物资，为该矿恢复建设提供了有利条件；其他各地尚未估价之物资、武器、弹药等则为数尚巨。通过此项清查工作，使广大干部更进一步确立了爱护国家资财的观念。并对过去若干浪费现象，也作了思想检查。
    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：中央人民政府铁道部直属天津铁路局材料厂，为贯彻政务院清理全国各企业仓库的决定，进行全厂废料清理，现已初步清出能用料折合小米达七十七万九千七百七十八斤。清理工作自三月十五日起，经十四天的紧张工作，使国民党匪帮统治时积存达十几年之久的废料彻底翻身，成为人民祖国的有用财产。清点出废料的价值超过该厂全体五百余名员工四个月薪金支出的总数而有余。清点前该厂厂长亲自负责，由十二人组成清点小组，召开会议，订出清点计划，对材料重量、数量的计算方法亦加规定。为解决清点中技术上的困难又反复讨论了鉴别材料的种类、形状及尺寸的方法，并征求许多技术人员协同进行。由于此次清点工作事前有充分的准备和明确的规定，故进行较快。同时各组在清点中，都表现了不怕肮脏、泥水和在杂乱铁堆中清点废料的困难，遂使工作在短时间内即获得巨大成果。
