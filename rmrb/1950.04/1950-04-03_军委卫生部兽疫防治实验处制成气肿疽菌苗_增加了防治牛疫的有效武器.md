　　Army Veterinary Department Experiment Station Develops Blackleg Vaccine
    Adding an Effective Weapon for Preventing Cattle Plague
    [This Newspaper] The Veterinary Department Experiment Station of the Army Veterinary Department of the Central Military Commission has successfully trial-produced a blackleg vaccine and is preparing to manufacture it in large quantities for the prevention of cattle plague in various regions. Blackleg is a very serious plague affecting cattle, and China has not yet manufactured serum vaccines for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Moreover, in the past, it was generally mistakenly believed that this disease was rare or even non-existent in China. Last spring, cattle plague occurred in the Bohai area of Shandong, and it was rumored to be anthrax. The Veterinary Department Experiment Station of the Army Veterinary College of the Central Military Commission sent people to prevent and treat it. During the work, the epidemic prevention personnel discovered that the cattle plague in Shanghe and other places was not anthrax but was suspected of being blackleg, and immediately sent people to send the materials back to the Veterinary Department Experiment Station. After detailed inspection by the department, it was confirmed to be blackleg. Furthermore, epidemic prevention personnel from the Veterinary College of the Army Veterinary Department also discovered that many sick cattle in Henan Province were suffering from blackleg while assisting in the prevention and treatment of cattle plague in the province last winter. At the same time, the blackleg epidemic was also proven to be prevalent in Heshun, Shanxi. It can be seen that this disease is prevalent in a wide range of areas in China. In order to solve the difficulties in preventing and treating this disease, the staff of the department initially manufactured a batch of "grave killing element" and sent it to the Bohai area for trial use, with good results. However, the production volume was small and insufficient for application. Later, they continued to research and expand equipment to produce blackleg vaccine. As of March 29, more than 200,000 cc had been produced and sent to the Bohai area for application. It is now continuing to expand equipment and preparing for mass production to meet the needs of various regions. (Bin, Sen)

　　军委卫生部兽疫防治实验处制成气肿疽菌苗
    增加了防治牛疫的有效武器
    【本报讯】中央军委卫生部兽疫防治实验处，试制气肿疽菌苗成功，正准备大量制造，以供各地防治牛瘟之用。按气肿疽为侵害耕牛很厉害的一种瘟病，防治此病的血清菌苗，我国尚未曾制造过。而且过去一般人误以为此病在中国很少，甚至没有。去春山东渤海区发生牛瘟，传说是炭疽，经军委卫生部兽医学院兽疫防治实验处派人前往防治。防疫人员在工作中，发现商河等地牛疫不是炭疽而有气肿疽之疑，当即派人将材料送回兽疫防治实验处。经该处详细检验，证实确为气肿疽。又军委卫生部兽医学院防疫人员在去冬协助河南省防治牛瘟工作中，亦发现该地病牛很多是患的气肿疽。同时，山西和顺一带也证明有气肿疽流行。可见此病在中国流行地区很广。该处职工为解决防治此病的困难，最初曾制造一批“坟击素”送渤海区试用，效果良好。但制造量少，不敷应用。后又继续研究，并扩充设备，制成了气肿疽菌苗。截至三月二十九日止，已先后制成二十余万西西，送往渤海区应用。现正继续扩大设备，准备大量制造，以供各地需要。    （斌、森）
