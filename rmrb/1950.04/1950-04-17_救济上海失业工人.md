Short Commentary

　　The appeal issued by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions for the relief of unemployed workers in Shanghai has greatly moved us. All worker brothers throughout China should immediately take all necessary and possible measures to launch a movement to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai.

　　Workers of the world are one family, and worker brothers across China are even more closely connected. We must not sit idly by and watch the livelihood difficulties of 150,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai and their families without providing assistance. The Shanghai working class has made great contributions to the modern revolutionary history of China. They have supported the struggles of worker brothers in other parts of the country. Today, due to the blockade and bombing of Shanghai by the remnants of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the reduced purchasing power of farmers due to disasters in some rural areas and seasonal limitations, and the reorganization and changes in the national economy caused by price stability, some industrial and commercial enterprises that relied on inflation for speculation for twelve years and were of no benefit to the national economy have declared bankruptcy, causing some workers to temporarily fall into unemployment or semi-unemployment. This is an unavoidable temporary difficulty in the process of reorganizing and advancing the national economy in the early stages of the new China after the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, and it is completely overcomeable.

　　Millions of employed workers across the country currently have jobs and food to eat. Although we also have difficulties, we are much better off than the unemployed workers in Shanghai. Seeing our own worker brothers and their wives and children in such a difficult situation, how can we not extend a friendly hand to help them? If every employed worker in the country donates one day's wages, we can help the unemployed workers in Shanghai overcome their difficulties. Under the call of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, local employed workers in Shanghai are launching a movement to relieve unemployed workers. Can't employed workers in other parts of the country achieve even greater results than worker brothers in Shanghai?! We should have full confidence in relying on the fraternal unity and enthusiastic mutual assistance of worker brothers across the country to enable unemployed workers in Shanghai and their families to successfully overcome their current difficulties.

　　In addition to the mutual assistance and relief from the working class, people from all other walks of life across the country should also give the unemployed workers in Shanghai the sympathy and assistance they deserve. Under the leadership of the People's Government, we should accelerate the annihilation of the remnants of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and liberate Taiwan. We should also carry out land reform in the vast rural areas to increase agricultural production and the purchasing power of farmers, so that our national economy can be rapidly restored and gradually developed with a focus.

　　救济上海失业工人
    上海总工会为救济上海失业工人所发出的呼吁，使我们受到了极大的感动。全中国工人阶级的弟兄们，应该立即采取一切必要与可能的方法，发动救济上海失业工人的运动。
    天下工人是一家，全中国工人阶级弟兄更是血肉相联的整体。我们决不能坐视上海十五万失业工人及其家属的生活困难而不予以援助。上海工人阶级在中国近代革命史上是很有功劳的。他们曾援助过全国其他地区工人弟兄的斗争。今天，由于帝国主义和国民党反动派残余匪帮对上海的封锁与轰炸，由于部分农村遭遇灾荒和季节的限制而降低了农民的购买力，以及由于物价稳定而引起的国民经济的改组与变化，使十二年来借通货膨胀而进行投机的一部分无益于国民生计的工商业宣告歇业，以致一部分工人暂时陷于失业与半失业状态。这是中国人民推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派在中国的统治，在新中国建设初期国民经济改组与进步的过程中不可避免的暂时困难，是完全可以克服的。
    我们全国各地几百万在业工人，目前有工做，有饭吃，虽然也有困难，但是，比上海失业工人的境遇就要好得多。我们看到工人阶级自己的弟兄和他们的妻子儿女处在这样困难的境地，能够不伸出友爱的手来援助他们吗？如果我们全国在业工人，每人捐出一天的工资，就可以帮助上海失业工人渡过难关。上海当地的在业工人，在上海总工会的号召之下，正展开着救济失业工人的运动，难道我们全国其他各地的在业工人还不会比上海的工人弟兄们做出更大的成绩吗？！我们应该有充分信心依靠全国工人阶级弟兄的友爱团结与热情互助，使上海失业工人及其家属胜利地渡过目前的困难。
    除了工人阶级的互助救济之外，全国其他各界人民，对于上海失业工人，同样应该给以应有的同情与援助。在人民政府的领导下，我们应该加速歼灭国民党蒋介石残余匪帮，解放台湾。并在广大农村中实行土地改革，提高农业生产和农民的购买力，让我们的国民经济迅速有重点地恢复和逐渐发展起来。
