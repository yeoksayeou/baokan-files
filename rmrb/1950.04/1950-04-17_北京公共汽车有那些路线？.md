                                                      Editor:
    Mr. Editor:
    Beijing's public transportation company has opened up many new routes, which citizens find very convenient. I suggest opening up a "Xiqiao Line" between the northwest city and the south city, from Xisi to Tianqiao, passing through the north entrance of Fuyou Street, West Chang'an Street, Hepingmen, Hufangqiao, and Zhushikou. There are many government offices and schools along this section, and the roads are flat, making driving very convenient. Please have the Beijing Public Transportation Company study whether this is feasible.
                                                      Zhou You:
    Mr. Zhou You:
    The Beijing Public Transportation Company is doing its best to gradually increase routes. They accept your suggestion to open a "Xiqiao Line" and are currently studying ways to do so.
                                                      Editor

　　北京公共汽车有那些路线？编辑同志：
    北京市公共汽车有那些路线，都经过些什么地方？
                                                    任明任明君：
    据北京市公共汽车公司答复，北京市公共汽车有下列几条路线：
    （一）“阜朝线”（又叫二路），从朝阳门到阜城门中间经过南小街、东四、灯市口、东安市场、东华门、北池子、故宫、北海、府右街北口、西四、沟沿。
    （二）“崇新线”（又叫三路），从崇文门到新街口中间经过东单、王府井、东安市场、东华门、北池子、景山东街、地安门、北海后门、辅仁大学、德内大街、护国寺。
    （三）“广西线”（又叫四路）。从广安门到西单是最近开辟的路线，中间经过王子坟、牛街、教子胡同、菜市口、校场口、宣武门外、绒线胡同。
    （四）“前鼓线”（又叫五路），从前门到鼓楼中间经过司法部街、南长街、西华门、北长街、景山东街南站、景山东街北站、地安门、后门桥。
    （五）“京颐线”。从东华门到颐和园中间经过西四、西直门、中农研究所、海甸、燕大、革大。
    （六）“京新线”。从东华门到新市区中间经过天安门、西单、复兴门、白云观、皇亭子、公主坟、罗道庄、万寿路、沙沟村、永定路、半壁店。
                                                      编者编辑先生：
    北京市公共汽车新辟了很多路线，市民都感到很方便。我建议西北城与南城间从西四到天桥再辟一条“西桥线”，中间经过府右街北口、西长安街、和平门、虎坊桥、珠市口。这一段沿途机关学校很多，全路道路平坦，行车很方便。请北京市公共汽车公司研究一下，是否可以。
                                                      周邮周邮君：
    北京市公共汽车公司正在尽力设法使路线逐步增加。他们接受你增辟“西桥线”的建议，现正在研究增辟办法。
                                                      编者
