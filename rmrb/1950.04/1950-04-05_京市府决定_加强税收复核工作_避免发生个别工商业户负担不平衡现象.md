[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Government has begun collecting industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1949. In order to better complete this work and avoid imbalances in the burden on individual industrial and commercial households, resulting in excessively light or heavy burdens, the Municipal People's Government decided at its administrative meeting last week to strengthen the work of the Tax Review Committee established during the previous collection of industrial and commercial taxes, establish a sound review organization, and conduct reviews with a focus. In addition to the previous appointment of Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu as the Chairman of the Committee and Cheng Hongyi and others as members, Vice Mayor Wu Han has been added as the Vice Chairman of the Committee.
