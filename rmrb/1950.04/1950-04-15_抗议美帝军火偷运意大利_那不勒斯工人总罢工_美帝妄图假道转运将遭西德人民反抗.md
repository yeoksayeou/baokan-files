　　Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The working people of Western Europe are strongly protesting the arrival of American arms in Europe.

　　According to a Rome dispatch from Telepress: Workers in Naples, Italy, held a general strike on the 12th to protest the "military aid" ship "Exilona" stealthily entering the port of Naples at night and unloading American arms at the military docks. A one-hour protest general strike was also held in Turin, an industrial city in northern Italy. Working people all over Italy are writing letters to support the workers in Naples.

　　In France, when the American ship "American Import," loaded with arms, arrived at the port of Cherbourg, it also encountered strong resistance from the French people. According to Agence France-Presse and Reuters: Before the ship arrived in Cherbourg, a large number of French police had cordoned off the main wharves of the port of Cherbourg, cutting off traffic, and prepared several trucks of barbed wire in an attempt to stop the demonstrating masses. However, the Association of Freedom and Peace Fighters still held a demonstration to protest the arrival of American arms.

　　In view of the determination of workers in Western European ports to prevent the arrival of American arms, US imperialism is preparing to use West German ports, especially Bremen, to transfer arms. On the other hand, according to a Telepress dispatch from Frankfurt on the 12th: The American occupation authorities in West Germany are considering issuing a ban prohibiting port workers from striking. Any worker who participates in a strike will be subject to suspension and police persecution. However, the firm stance of West German port workers has made the US military doubt whether the ban can be "fulfilled as desired."

    【新华社十四日讯】西欧劳动人民强烈地抗议美国军火运达欧洲。
    据电通社罗马讯：意大利那不勒斯工人于十二日举行总罢工，抗议“军援”船只“爱克齐隆娜”号于夜间偷偷驶进那不勒斯港，并在军事码头卸下美国军火。意北工业城市都灵亦举行一小时的抗议总罢工。意大利各地劳动人民都写信支援那不勒斯工人。
    在法国，当美国装运军火的“美国进口”号船驶抵瑟堡港时，也遭遇到法国人民强烈的反抗。据法新社与路透社消息：当船只抵达瑟堡前，大批法国警察已把瑟堡港主要码头拦开，断绝了交通，并准备了几卡车的带钩铁丝网，企图阻止示威的群众。但是，自由和平战士协会仍举行了示威游行，以抗议美国军火的到来。
    美帝国主义鉴于西欧各港口工人阻止美国军火到来的决心，正准备利用西德的港口，特别是不来梅港转运军火。另一方面，据电通社法兰克福十二日讯：西德美国占领当局正考虑发布禁止港口工人罢工的禁令，任何参加罢工的工人，将受停工的惩罚和警察的迫害。但是，西德港口工人的坚定立场，已使美国军方怀疑禁令能否“如愿以偿”。
