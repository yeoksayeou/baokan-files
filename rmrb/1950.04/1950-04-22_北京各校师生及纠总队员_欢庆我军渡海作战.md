Cheer Our Army's Sea-Crossing Operation

[Reported by this newspaper] Teachers, students of various schools in Beijing, and members of the Headquarters of Vigilance Corps joyfully celebrate the People's Liberation Army's victorious landing on Hainan Island. Wen Jiasi, Head of the Western Language Department of Peking University, said: "The landing on Hainan Island is the prelude to the liberation of Taiwan. Like the recent spring rain, it is good news for us in Beijing." Yang Hui, a professor in the Chinese Department, said: "After hearing this news, I felt indescribable joy." Yang Chuanwei, Vice Chairman of the Student Union of the university, stated: "In today's situation where the People's Liberation War has not yet fully concluded, striving to support the frontlines remains one of the primary tasks of our young students. We must take practical actions to fully support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea and completely annihilating the remaining bandits." Students studying in the library at Tsinghua University, upon hearing the news of the landing on Hainan Island, lifted up the student reading out the extra edition and cheered for several minutes. In addition, teachers and students from the Beijing Management Institute of Jiaotong University, the Teacher Training Class of Beijing Normal University, the New China Women's Vocational School, the Advanced Engineering School, Beijing Normal School, the affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University, as well as the Workers' Night School of the Beijing First Cultural Center and the Adult Night School of the Fourth Cultural Center, all erupted in cheers and celebrations after hearing this good news. Many students from the Advanced Engineering School immediately started performing the Yangge dance, and every student sang in unison, "Taiwan must be liberated, Tibet must be liberated! Imperialists get out, get out!" Members of the Beijing Vigilance Corps listened to the news of our army crossing the ocean on the radio. Comrades of the Second Detachment participating in labor production heard the news when they returned from work at six o'clock, and everyone jumped up excitedly, with some joyfully shouting, "Chiang Kai-shek is about to be completely finished!"
