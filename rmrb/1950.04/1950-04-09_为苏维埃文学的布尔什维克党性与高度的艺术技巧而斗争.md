Strive for the Bolshevik Party Spirit and High Artistic Skill of Soviet Literature
By K. Simonov, translated by Jin Ren

(Continued from Issue 42 of this journal)

The author here completely forgets all our methods of exchanging experiences: Stakhanovite workers' travels, technical workers' congresses, the exchange of technical information between factories—in a word, everything that exists in real life does not require any report on Kolabryov's hasty flight, but rather a description of the collective's intense work and the friendly help given to it by the collective of another factory.

Based on such an example, it is clear that the author is ignorant of the reality of factory life, lacks a correct understanding of what is happening in our industry, and is not good at seeing the specific forms of advanced things that are driving our heavy industry forward.

The continued rise in production at the Cherkulisk factory—that is, the saving of three minutes on the factory conveyor belt, which the author predicted at the end of the novel—is also an incorrect depiction. In fact, these three minutes are the result of the factory collective overcoming many huge difficulties, a tense struggle between the advanced and the backward, and the expression of invention, culture, talent, and the special noble knowledge possessed by engineers and workers in our industry!

If we believe what the author has written, most of his characters possess the highest human qualities. Kolabryov—an excellent leader of a large factory; Luken, the party organizer of this factory—is an engineer with a thorough understanding of the business; Tatyana Porobtseva—is a talented artist. However, while the author declares that the protagonists have many excellent qualities, he does not show how these qualities are specifically developed and how they are realized. Therefore, in the novel, there is an attempt to describe new things, but in essence, this new thing is not seen. He only sees that life follows the general direction of progress, but does not show how this happens in real life. As a result, he creates some images that are in many ways untrue and unbelievable. And this is precisely a violation of the essence of the method of socialist realism.

At the same time, I would also like to say that Comrade Panfyorov has apparently not considered the just criticisms made by the party press at various times of the second part of his novel "Struggle for Peace" and "In the Country of the Conquered." The significance of these opinions proves that the author's research on the standards of conduct of people in our army and the work of Soviet people in Germany is not sufficient, and as a result, he has written many untrue things.

Panfyorov's novel "Great Art" needs to be severely and sharply criticized because its mistakes are great. It should be criticized first of all because most of the mistakes in this novel are related to the author's departure from the method of socialist realism, insufficient research on our real life, and the inability to correctly and positively describe the new things in our life, so that readers can see living Soviet people in the characters in the novel. In Panfyorov's novel, due to the contempt for socialist realism, the desired effect was not achieved.

However, while sharply and severely criticizing the novel, it is also necessary to point out the way to revise it. If Comrade Panfyorov can truly describe the workers' collective and the factory's party organization, if he can recreate some vivid and correct images of advanced factory workers together with Kolabryov, if he can show how the factory is built by the collective's strength, if he can correctly show the methods used by Soviet people to fight against the enemy, then this work can be revised. Yermilov did not draw such a conclusion in his article published in "Literary Gazette" (Nos. 9 and 10, 1950). In this article, one cannot feel a caring and party attitude towards a well-known Soviet writer who has published a work that is in many ways erroneous, obviously immature, but can be revised. In Comrade Yermilov's article, there is not even an expression of willingness that Comrade Panfyorov revise his work, so that as a result of the author's supplementary work, it can become a valuable work needed by the people. And this wish—is not just a form of critic's courtesy! Our literary criticism is a social undertaking, a form of party leadership of literature.

The party teaches us to be careful with the cadre of Soviet writers. If we talk about some mistakes of a Soviet writer, then who, besides the critic, is the person who discovers these mistakes and can carefully and comprehensively think about this work and whether it can be revised? Who, besides the person who cares about the fate of Soviet literature, can awaken the author to revise the discovered mistakes? Who, besides the person who is armed with party principles, can try his best to point out the road for the author to revise his work? If the critical article does not have this wish, we have the right to think that this article is unwilling to help Soviet literature, but that the author of the article is using the pages of newspapers or magazines to show off.

Along with this, what should be regarded as a principle issue for our critical circles is the editorial written for Sofronov's play "Moscow Character" published in "Literary Gazette" (No. 7, 1950).

Without mentioning its past unreserved positive evaluation of this play, "Literary Gazette" declared that "Moscow Character" is a play with an incorrect central idea. Because the editorial department did not point out to the author the possible ways to correct the mistakes in the play, judging from this, it is obvious that it is considered that the play is hopeless. It is reminiscent of the fact that "Literary Gazette" did not show a real caring attitude towards the current situation of Soviet literature in this article. While correctly talking about the mistakes that Sofronov had and that many critics who commented on this play (including the author of this article) did not point out, "Literary Gazette" attributed the entire content of the play to these mistakes.

What is the theme of Sofronov's play? The play tells about the work of production innovators, about the new machine tools they invented that are needed by the textile industry. The entire staff of the textile complex and the party district committee support the promotion of this machine. Potapov—the factory director of the factory affiliated to the Agricultural Machinery Department, located in the area where the machine tool inventors live and the textile factory that supports this invention—refuses the suggestion to produce this machine tool in the factory he leads. However, the factory director's reason is to emphasize that he has his own plan and his own tasks, and secretly he is unwilling to help promote that valuable invention.

In addition to the fact that the factory is located in the same area and the textile factory is also in this area, Sofronov did not give any other reasons to explain the necessity of manufacturing this new invention machine in the factory led by Potapov. Naturally, this is also incorrect.

Immediately afterwards, Sofronov made a second mistake, using the words of the characters in the play to ask Potapov to manufacture the machines in large quantities immediately. However, everyone who is familiar with the principles of socialist planning knows that the issue of manufacturing new machine tools should be decided by the appropriate organs of the national economy, to be in line with the overall national plan, to be in line with the rational distribution of forces and materials, and to take into account the overall interests of many factories—related factories and delivery factories. Of course, this issue cannot be decided within the scope of the district, as happened in this play.

Due to these erroneous premises, many more serious mistakes have arisen in the play. Potapov, who refused to manufacture the machine tools, was called to the party district committee, and the district committee decided to suggest "guaranteeing immediate preparation for the manufacture of machine tools." In this way, the party district committee became an administrative manager in this scene, essentially predetermining the opinion of the department and ordering Potapov to start preparing to manufacture the machine tools, ordering the preparation methods for transforming the factory. The district committee certainly has no right to do these things. In actual real life, this is called destroying the important principles of leadership and will be subject to our most severe criticism.

In addition, although it is talking about the overall national cause—talking about the machine tools needed by the entire textile industry—the play stubbornly and persistently emphasizes that the machine tools were invented "in our district," "for our complex," "by our staff." This is to say that Potapov should play the most important role wherever he works in which area.

In this way, here, on the issue of machine tools needed by an entire department of socialist industry, the emphasis is not on the national aspect, but on "district patriotism." In these circumstances, this patriotism is regarded as localism, as autocracy and contempt for the principles of socialist planning.

Obviously, many life observations that served as the basis for the play were used uncritically by the author. Therefore, some scenes in the play reflect the flawed behavior of some local leaders, who treat the overall national interests and the principles of socialist planning with a bureaucratic attitude, and when there is a need to seriously study the issues and take into account the interests of the country's entire national economy to solve these problems, they fall into the fanaticism of administrative management.

The author must revise this very serious mistake. And this mistake can certainly be corrected if the play is seriously rewritten.

Sofronov must listen to the criticisms of the several serious shortcomings of his play, and rewrite and revise the play. It is possible to do this, and it must be done. Do not pay attention to the opinion of "Literary Gazette," because that opinion attempts to drive the author into a dead end, and does not offer any suggestions for revising the play.

The requirements for a deep and comprehensive study of real life that some writers who attempt to write in accordance with the method of socialist realism offer to themselves are naturally necessary for Soviet critics.

Without a deep and comprehensive study of our real life and without a sense of new things, it is impossible to become a party critic. It is impossible to criticize works from the point of view of artistic authenticity and from the point of view of our struggle to build communism.

Critics who do not study reality, are detached from life, and only engage in desk work cannot correctly evaluate the works of Soviet literature and realize the party leadership style engaged in by something called literary criticism.

Indeed, our life is diverse. Its leading and progressive trends are actually accumulated by the labor efforts of the Soviet people, our social workers, in various sections of the construction of the communist edifice. Writers cannot create artistic works of perfect value without a deep understanding of some specific manifestations of life. However, can a critic who cannot distinguish between advanced and backward things in life itself correctly and appropriately criticize these works, support the progressive things in them, and expose the backward things?

Many people in our critical circles have protested in order to answer this correct requirement, on the grounds that a critic cannot become an omnipotent doctor, and cannot be equally familiar with all aspects of real life.

These protests are incorrect.

A correct and deep understanding of the main driving force of real life and the basic processes that occur in Soviet society should be the basis for studying real life. A critic who has such an understanding will be able to correctly evaluate works that describe all aspects of life. In addition, a critic must sacredly keep in mind Comrade Stalin's instructions that a party member should be concerned about everything in his work.

Secondly, no one requires the critic's omnipotence. The critic's right—is that in his own thesis he should first of all be concerned with those aspects that he has particularly deeply studied and fully familiarized himself with. And conversely, no one can give him the right to explain all the phenomena of life and touch on all the problems (including those he is not familiar with and those he has rarely studied) omnipotently.

And it is precisely that many critical articles published in recent years have suffered from a lack of concrete understanding of real life.

We can take the example of critic Shkairin's article on Ehrenburg's "The Storm" (No. 1, 1948, "October"). This article dangerously illustrates the author's unfamiliarity with international relations during the period of preparation and conduct of World War II, and his unfamiliarity with the specific environment that developed these relations, and his lack of understanding of the heroic encouragement model of the Russian Soviet people to the struggle of French Communist Party members against the Hitler occupiers.

We can take the example of Vazhdayev's article "On the Concept of Ideological Image in Fadeev's 'The Rout'" (No. 3, 1949, "New World"). This article shows both that the knowledge of the characteristics of guerrilla activities in the Far East is superficial, and that it does not understand the necessity for a critic to combine the ideological analysis and artistic analysis of works.

We can take the example of Beryozov's article on children's literature (No. 7, 1949, "October"). In that article, it is obvious that the author is not concerned about the educational tasks of Soviet children and Soviet children's literature.

We can also take the example of Makarov's article on Polevoi's novella "Return" (No. 58, 1949, "Literary Gazette"). In the article, the critic pointed out some of the shortcomings of Polevoi's novel, such as not being able to master vivid materials and not seeing the serious shortcomings of the novel—the description of production and the innovative process of steelmaking in advanced factories is incorrect and not correct.

The party press has repeatedly emphasized that if Soviet criticism wants to become the driving force for the development of Soviet literature, it must engage in the artistic analysis of works, helping authors to steadily improve their skills.

However, many, many of our critics have not yet made the necessary conclusions for themselves based on these instructions. Criticism of Soviet literary works is often of a notice nature. Many essays and articles say that the author's thoughts are very good, the conception is very correct, the author is standing on the ideologically correct position, and he describes excellent Soviet people. That is, it only explains that the author has thought, and he describes the people he has thought about, but it does not explain how he has completed his conception and how he has shaped his characters. In this type of thesis, the artistic analysis of the work seems to be unimportant, and it only appears at the tail of the thesis, forming a conclusion that routinely points out a few minor defects.

When Roselis discussed Ivan Lyabokryach's novel about an ordinary collective farmer (No. 4, 1949, "New World"), he rarely talked about the artistic value of the work, and did not talk about a single shortcoming. However, according to Roselis himself, he was commenting on "the maiden work of a young Ukrainian writer!" Zhuchkov, when commenting on Kalinchenko's novella "Friends of Kamchatka" (No. 5, 1949, "October"), limited himself to describing the contents of the novel. There was no analysis of the artistic form in the article at all. The three sentences that only talked about this issue cannot be regarded as talking about the artistic value of the novel: "The novel is easy to read. The author tells the truth of life in simple, popular language. The only (the emphasis is added by the author of the article, Simonov) worthy of blame——this is that in many places encountered in the novel, the wording lacks a correct translation." Isn't this too polite? Does a Soviet writer need this kind of liberalism? Brainina elaborately wrote a whole article of praise for Guria's novella "Kind City" (No. 7, 1949, "Banner"). The critic's entire task was directed to one thing—that is, to retell the content of this interesting, but fundamentally not yet free of shortcomings, novel.

This type of comment is essentially an evasion of a true criticism of the work in disguise, an evasion of answering the question of how the author handles his tasks. If we carefully analyze the structure of these papers, and think about how the authors of the articles understand the issue of form and content, then it is clear that the structure of these papers is completely formalized (complete formalism!). The authors of the articles do not understand the interrelationship between form and content correctly, and unreasonably separate the two from each other: at the beginning, they only talk about the content, and do not analyze the artistic form adopted by this content in this specific work at all. Then, in the conclusion, they only check the individual formal defects in the work, separating them from the content of the matter, from the real life described, and from the author's ideological position.

Many critics do not understand the necessity of criticizing a work not only from the point of view of analyzing its artistic defects, but also from the point of view of analyzing its artistic achievements. Critics of this kind do not point out artistic achievements and do not analyze them. That is to say, they do not point out their good and correct aspects, and do not point out the direction in which the author should strive in his future works. They are only acting as an emotionless bystander to the work. A Soviet critic should not become a bystander (to understand this word from a bad meaning), but should become a soldier fighting for the party's cause in life and literature!

The distance of literary theory from the critical circle is particularly unbearable.

A literary theorist who buries himself in archives and neglects modern works of art has a very narrow understanding of his scholarly tasks, forgetting Comrade Stalin's words calling on our science not to be separated from life, but to face the necessary requirements of the people. For example, who is preventing our Professor Gudzi, who is unusually familiar with Russian poetry and its history, from writing a book about a great Soviet poet like Isakovsky? And it is precisely that until now, our critical circles have not written any serious article suitable for the position he occupies in Soviet poetry for this poet.

In many cases, the lack of artistic analysis of works is not only related to the critic's incorrect understanding of his tasks, not only related to his lack of due business talent and professional skills, but also illustrates many unprincipled, sectarian, friendly ideas. In this case, artistic analysis is deliberately relaxed due to unwillingness to criticize this or another work.

This type of criticism is the characteristic of many papers published in the magazine "Drama." Abramov's paper entitled "The Road of the Future"—on Surov's "Green Street" (No. 1, 1949), an infinitely praised but completely uncritical article, belongs to this category. Zaharov's paper "New Feelings"—on Surov's three plays (No. 8, 1949), also has this kind of praise nature, almost completely forgiving the shortcomings and lack of analysis of artistic skills.

The unlimited praise for "one's own" authors——first of all, including editors and members of the editorial board——is the characteristic of many articles and essays published in the criticism and book review column of the magazine "October" in recent years. Not long ago, the party press cited examples of this type of criticism published in the magazine "October." Now we have to go back to this issue again, because the editorial department of the magazine has not yet used the instructions of the newspaper to draw serious conclusions for themselves.

The editorial department of the magazine "October," in any case, is unwilling to express a reaction to criticism. In the actual work of the magazine, an event that is simply unprecedented for our art and socio-political science magazines occurred: No. 11 "October" was published in the form of a literary anthology. It was composed of three works: the complete publication of the long novel "Great Art" by Panfyorov, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, the continuation of another long novel, and the publication of a play. The criticism and book review column was completely absent in this issue. In the subsequent two issues, Nos. 12 and 1, the editorial department also did not publish direct statements from the editorial board, nor did it publish articles with particularly obvious party principles and deep artistic analysis to answer the criticisms of the newspaper. Only by publishing those articles could it be proved that the editorial department had made practical conclusions based on the criticism of its mistakes.

In the second issue of 1950, the editorial department published an article by Belik, the main content of which was an attempt to give a devastating crushing rebuttal to the entire literary work of Talasenkov, a critic who had recently criticized the magazine "October" in "Truth Daily." Of course, Talasenkov's literary activities have many serious errors and fallacies, and should be criticized like any other critic. However, the prejudice that Belik's article published in the magazine "October" had is suspicious, and in this case, it forces suspicion about the author's honesty.

In Belik's article, not only are some of Talasenkov's real mistakes criticized, but some imaginary mistakes are obviously criticized far-fetchedly. For example, some sentences were quoted from Talasenkov's article, which definitely stated that Soviet literature "is a step forward in the development of human art..." So "we must constantly emphasize the new qualitative stage, and use the method of socialist realism to raise art to this stage." Belik is obviously distorting, and the word "only" added by him, which is completely contrary to the sentences he quoted, helps to distort the meaning of Talasenkov's article. He wrote: "Therefore, we believe that Talasenkov's opinion that Soviet literature is only a step forward in the development of human art is wrong. The error of Talasenkov's argument is due to the fact that in Soviet literature (in whose body or in what work?——the author's original note) the essence of something that is qualitatively new——socialist literature is denied, or, according to the critic's opinion, it is only gradually moving forward, that is, it is only taking a step forward."

It is not difficult to be sure that this false accusation is related to the fact that Belik's long article did not touch on the criticism made by our party press of the criticism department of the magazine "October."

All of this listed above, combined with the fact that the editorial board of the magazine "October" has not directly addressed the criticisms made by the party press of several shortcomings of the magazine's criticism department, can lead to the view that there is a disguised attempt in Belik's article to settle accounts with the author, because this author published an article criticizing the fact that there are actually many unhealthy phenomena in the criticism department of the magazine "October."

Not all the editorial departments of our literary organs understand that boasting and self-promotion of the editor-in-chief and editorial board in their own publications will lower these publications, and that it is contradictory to the modest attitude of self-evaluation that Soviet people have.

The newspaper "Soviet Art" also has this shortcoming. For example, in just one issue, No. 16, 1949, it played many tricks and respectfully mentioned the name of Surov, a member of the newspaper's editorial board, in various articles: in the editorial, in Zamansky's article "Meeting with Heroes," and twice in the chronicles. In addition, in this issue of the newspaper, there are also two articles—Makarov's "The Breath of the Future" and Nazvanov's "The Joy of Creation"—which are talking about the roles they played in Surov's play. At the same time, in the newspaper "Soviet Art," there was no place to publish articles about Sandro Shanshiashvili's play, which won the 1949 Stalin Prize.

Indeed, here we should remind you once again: strengthen the modest attitude.

The recently concluded plenary meeting of the Soviet Writers' Association played a positive role in our literary social life. The plenary meeting clearly stated that as long as criticism and self-criticism are launched as required by the party, self-criticism will become a very huge driving force in the development of our literature. As long as these principles are forgotten, then it will have a counterproductive effect on the growth of literature.

The plenary meeting exposed the relationships of friendship that have not yet been eliminated in the Soviet Writers' Association, exposed the unprincipled sectarian groups in the editorial department of the magazine "October," and exposed the chaos in the work of the Drama Committee and the Moscow Playwrights' Branch, which did not carry out the tasks assigned to them after defeating the anti-patriotic critic group.

In the examples of Kataev's long novel "For Soviet Power" cited at the meeting, it was revealed that the editorial department of "New World" magazine lacked the necessary requirements for literary works. It should be said that the first part of Kayetlin's long novel "Open Book" has many essential shortcomings. For the editorial department's failure to complete its work with the author, showing acute illness, and publishing a not fully mature work is absolute evidence. The meeting pointed out that the editorial board of "Literary Gazette" lacked self-criticism in its work, and the editorial department attempted not to talk about its own mistakes, and there was a lack of a fully principled line in the work of the newspaper.

The plenary meeting pointed out that the leading organs of the Writers' Association—the Secretariat and the Presidium—have glossed over several sharp issues in recent years and have not developed criticism.

The plenary meeting pointed out that several of our magazines and "Literary Gazette" only regarded the struggle against cosmopolitanism as just a battle. They did not listen to the party's demands and did not stand on a high ideological position to ruthlessly criticize this manifestation of bourgeois consciousness.

Some comrades incorrectly understand that all cosmopolitanism only aroused fierce attacks on the anti-patriotic critic group against some progressive works of Soviet drama, and that the struggle against cosmopolitanism can be considered over if the anti-patriotic critic group is defeated.

Cosmopolitanism is the military rule ideology of American imperialism. It attempts to unify all the world's nations, eradicate their national foundations, and force them to obey its own will. Naturally, the struggle against this hostile ideology of ours is a serious struggle, a struggle that must be carried out on a broad front at present. The attacks of cosmopolitan elements, their attempts to influence literature—in a disguised way, and sometimes in a completely open way—are still continuing. From this point of view, it is particularly necessary to resolutely criticize Comrade Kovalenkov's erroneous speech made at the meeting. This speech directly defended Green's works, which are full of obvious cosmopolitan fallacies.

The plenary meeting pointed out that the organs of the Writers' Association conducted many fruitless discussions (the unnecessary and unprincipled discussion on Veselovsky in the magazine "October," the discussion on Mayakovsky in the "Literary Gazette"), and sometimes, in the midst of these discussions, published some unnecessary and harmful controversial articles in their own pages. At the same time, the organs of the Soviet Writers' Association rarely published true, principled, and unfeeling analyses of the many books published, and rarely published creative and enthusiastic comments on many necessary issues in literature. As everyone knows, if "there is no creative discussion, no criticism and self-criticism——then there can be no forward movement. Creative discussion and objective, independent criticism——this has become a theorem——are important conditions for creative development. Wherever there is no criticism and creative discussion, the source of development will dry up, and the hotbed of staleness and stagnation will take root..." (Zhdanov's speech at the Congress of Soviet Musicians convened by the Central Committee of the CPSU (B)).

The Writers' Association and its Secretariat and Presidium, several magazines, and "Literary Gazette" are facing the necessity of making principled summaries of their work in a Bolshevik way based on the just criticisms of their work published at that plenary meeting.

The Writers' Association, several magazines, and "Literary Gazette" should evaluate their work self-critically based on the clear program of criticism that the party gives to the development of our literature in several of its historical documents and in several papers in the party press.

However, it is not enough to blame the shortcomings of one's own work, and it is not enough to admit one's mistakes. What is in front of the Writers' Association and its leading organs and all the organs of the Writers' Association is the most important——that is, to formulate a broad program that unites all literary forces based on the instructions of the party, and to formulate a broad program that launches criticism and self-criticism based on the party's principles, with a brutal struggle against various forms of sectarianism and mutually tolerant systems. The Secretariat and Presidium of the Writers' Association should establish the entire work of leading writers based on broad common discussions.

Soviet literature——the most advanced literature in the world——is developing and consolidating. In the years of war and postwar, including 1949, it produced many artistic works that are particularly profound in party spirit in raising and solving several major national issues.

Relying on these works, in adapting to the party's call, literary criticism should launch an active program for the future work of our literature. Literary criticism should stubbornly demand that Soviet writers abide by the principles of Bolshevik party spirit and improving artistic skills. It is possible to make the same demands on the analysis of a book, both in terms of ideological content and in terms of artistic skills.

Literary criticism must always pay attention to Comrade Stalin's instruction that writers are "engineers of human souls." Comrade Stalin's words emphasize the active role of Soviet literature, and emphasize the active role of Soviet literary criticism in cultivating the new people of Soviet society——builders of communism. (End)

Postscript:

2. Starting from the 55th line of the short line in the first column, "All require artists to be loyal to the principles of party spirit..." should be translated as: "When requiring artists to be loyal to the principles of party spirit and the method of socialist realism, they must always and without exception put the task of completing artistic skills and completing artistic forms in front of them."
3. "Beketov's experience" was omitted below the word "play" in the 17th line from the bottom of the short line in the third column.

After making clear this truth known to any Soviet person, Kolabryov ordered a lot of materials from the Moscow Automobile Factory, studying them and exclaiming: 'This is what we need!'"

　　为苏维埃文学的布尔什维克党性与高度的艺术技巧而斗争
    Ｋ·西蒙诺夫作金人译
            （续本刊第四十二期）
    作者在这里完全忘记掉我们所有的交换经验方法了：斯塔汉诺夫分子的旅行，技术工作者的代表大会，工厂相互间的技术情报的交流，——一句话，现实生活中所存在的一切并不要求对珂拉布廖夫的匆匆来去的飞行作什么报导，而是要求描写集体的紧张工作和另外一个工厂的集体方面对它的友谊帮助。
    根据这样一个例子，这儿显然说明了作者对工厂现实生活的无知，而且对那种在我们工业中所发生的事物缺乏正确的理解，也不善于看到那种推动我们重工业前进的先进事物的具体形式。
    在契尔库里斯克工厂中的生产继续上升——就是作者在小说结尾所预约的在工厂传送装置上节省三分钟的那种事——也是描写不正确的。其实这三分钟——是工厂的集体克服了许多巨大困难，是先进与落后的紧张斗争，是发明，文化，才智，以及我们工业中的工程师和工人们所具有的特殊高尚知识的表现！
    如果相信作者所写的文字，他的人物大多数都是具有最高人类品质的。珂拉布廖夫——一个大工厂的优秀领导者；卢肯，这个工厂的党的组织家，——是个深通业务的工程师；塔琪扬娜·波罗甫采娃——是个天才的艺术家。然而作者一面宣布主角们具有很多的优秀的品质，却并没有表现出如何具体开展这些品质，如何把它们实现出来，因此，在小说中是企图描写新的事物，本质上却没有看见这种新的事物。他只看到生活遵循着前进的一般方向，但是并未表现出这在现实生活中是如何发生的。于是当然就创造出一些在许多方面不真实的，不能令人相信的形像。而且这正是违反社会主义现实主义方法本质的。
    同时还想说说，显然潘菲约洛夫同志未曾考虑过那些在各个时期党报对他的长篇小说《为和平而斗争》的第二部和《在被征服者的国家内》所做的公正的批评意见，这些意见的意义证明作者对我们军队中的人物行为的标准，对在德国的苏联人的工作研究得不够充分，结果就写出了许多不真实的东西。
    潘菲约洛夫的小说《伟大的艺术》需要遭受严厉的和尖锐的批评，因为它的错误是很大的。它应当遭受批评首先是因为这本小说的大部错误都和作者的脱离社会主义现实主义的方法，和对我们现实生活研究得不够充分，和不善于正确地、肯定地描写我们生活中的新事物，以便读者能在小说的人物身上看出活生生的苏维埃人等问题有关的。在潘菲约洛夫的小说中由于对社会主义现实主义的蔑视所以未收到应有的效果。
    不过，在尖锐和严厉批评小说的同时，也要指出它的修改的途径。如果潘菲约洛夫同志能真正地描写工人的集体和工厂的党组织，如果和珂拉布廖夫一同再创造一些活生生的，正确的工厂先进工人们的形像，如果他表现出工厂是如何由集体的力量兴建起来，如果他能正确地表现苏维埃人用来和敌人斗争的那些方法，那末这本作品是可以修改的。叶尔米洛夫在刊登于《文学报》（一九五○年第九号和第十号）上的论文中并没有对这本小说下这样的结论。在这篇文章中感觉不到对一个享有盛名的、发表了在多方面有错误的、显然是不成熟的、然而可以修改的作品的苏维埃作家的关心的和党的态度。在叶尔米洛夫同志的论文中甚至没有表示愿望潘菲约洛夫同志修改自己的作品，以便使它因作者补充工作的结果能成为有价值的和人民所需要的作品。而且这种愿望——并不仅仅是批评家的礼貌的形式！我们的文学批评是社会的事业，是党领导文学的一种形式。
    党教导我们对苏维埃作家干部要小心翼翼。如果谈到一位苏维埃作家的若干错误的话，那末除了批评家之外，还有哪一个发现这些错误的人能很关心地全面来想想这部作品，它是否还能修改呢；除了批评家之外，还有哪一个关怀苏维埃文学命运的人能唤醒作者来修改已发现的错误呢；除了批评家之外，还有哪一个以党性原则武装起来的人能竭力指给作者以修改其作品的道路呢？如果批评的文章没具有这种愿望，我们就有权力认为这篇文章是不愿意帮助苏维埃文学的，而是文章的作者利用报纸或杂志的篇页来出风头的。
    和这一同，对于我们的批评界来讲算作一个原则问题的，应当说是《文学报》（一九五○年第七号）所刊载的，为了梭甫洛诺夫的剧本《莫斯科性格》所写的社论。
    《文学报》对于自己过去对这个剧本所做的毫无保留的积极评价一字未提，就宣布《莫斯科性格》是一个具有不正确的中心思想的剧本，因为编辑部并没有对作者指出剧本错误可能改正的途径，由此判断，显然是认为剧本是无希望的了。令人想到《文学报》在这篇文章中没有表现出对苏联文学现状的真正的关心态度。正确地谈到梭甫洛诺夫所具有的和许多评论这个剧本的批评家（也包括本文的作者在内）所未指出的错误，《文学报》就把剧本的全部内容都归咎到这种错误上去了。
    梭甫洛诺夫的剧本是什么主题呢？剧本中是讲述生产革新者的工作，是讲由他们所发明的，而为纺织工业所需要的新机床。纺织综合工厂的全体人员和党的区委都支持这种机器的推进。波塔波夫——农业机器部所属工厂的，座落在机床发明者所居住的和支持这种发明的纺织工厂的区域内的工厂厂长——拒绝在他所领导的工厂内生产这种机床的建议。然而厂长的理由是强调他有自己的计划，有自己的任务，暗中是不愿帮助推进那种宝贵的发明。
    对于在波塔波夫领导的工厂中制造这种新发明机器的必需性，梭甫洛诺夫除了讲到那种工厂是座落在同一区内，纺织工厂也在这个区内等情况之外，再没有举出任何理由来解释。自然，这也就不正确了。
    紧接着，梭甫洛诺夫又犯了第二个错误，用剧中人物的口要求波塔波夫立刻大量制造机器。然而凡是熟悉社会主义计划原则的人都知道，关于制造新机床的问题是应由国民经济的适当机关来决定的，要适合于总的国家计划，要适应于力量和资料的合理分配，照顾到许多工厂——有连带关系的工厂和交货工厂——的总的利益。这种问题当然不能像在这个剧中发生的，在区的范围内来决定。
    由于这些错误的前提，剧本中就产生了许多更严重的错误。把拒绝制造机床的波塔波夫叫到党的区委会去，并由区委会决定建议“保证立刻准备制造机床。”这样，党的区委在这个场面上就成了行政管理了，本质上是预先决定了部的意见，责成波塔波夫开始准备制造机床，命令进行改造工厂的准备方法，对于这些，区委当然是无权的，在实际的现实生活中这就叫做破坏领导的重要原则，要遭受到我们最严厉的批评。
    再加上，虽然是谈的总的国家事业——谈的是为全部纺织工业所需要的机床，——在剧本中却是顽强地和固执地强调机床是“在我们区内”，“为我们的综合工厂”，“由我们的工作人员”所发明的，这就是要波塔波夫自己在哪一个地区工作，他就应当起最重大的作用。
    这样，在这儿关于为社会主义工业一个整部门所需要的机床问题，首先强调的不是国家方面，而是强调的“区的爱国主义”，这种爱国主义在这些情况中就被当作本位主义，被当作专权而且蔑视社会主义计划化的原则了。
    显然，有许多作为剧本基础的生活观察是作者未加批判地就拿来用的。因此剧本中有一些场面反映了一些地方领导人物的有缺点的行为，他们以官僚主义的态度对待总的国家利益、对待社会主义计划化的原则，而当需要对问题作认真的研究，和照顾到国家的整个国民经济的利益来解决这些问题的地方，他们又陷在行政管理的狂热中。
    这一个非常严重的错误作者是一定要修改的。而且这种错误如果在认真地对剧本改写时一定能修正。
    梭甫洛诺夫要倾听对他的剧本所做的若干严重缺点的批评，要从新写过和修正剧本。可能这样做，而且必须这样做，不要去理《文学报》的意见，因为那种意见企图把作者赶到牛角尖里去，而且并未提出任何修改剧本的建议。
    一些企图按照社会主义现实主义的方法写作的作家们所提供给自身的对现实生活的深刻与全面研究的要求，对于苏维埃的批评家来说，自然也是必要的。
    对于我们的现实生活没有深刻的和全面的研究，没有对新鲜事物的感觉就不可能成为党的批评，不可能成为从艺术的真实性的观点出发，从我们的为建设共产主义的斗争的观点出发，以估价作品的批评。
    不研究现实，脱离开生活，仅仅从事于书斋工作的批评家是不能正确地估价苏维埃文学的作品和实现那种用称为文学批评的东西所从事的党的领导方式的。
    的确，我们的生活是多样的。它的领导的、进步的倾向实际是由苏维埃人民群众，我们的社会工作者的劳动努力，在建筑共产主义的大厦的各个不同地段上累积起来的。作家们对于生活中的若干具体表现没有深刻的认识，就不能创造有完美价值的艺术作品。然而一个批评家不会对生活本身中的先进的与落后的东西加以分别，难道能正确地，适当地批评这些作品，拥护其中的进步东西和揭露其落后的东西吗？
    在我们的批评界中有不少人为了答复这个正确的要求，提出了抗议，理由是一个批评家不可能成为万能博士，不可能同样地很好地熟悉现实生活的各方面。
    这些抗议是不正确的。
    正确的和深刻的了解现实生活的主要动力，在苏维埃社会所发生的基本进程，这应该是研究现实生活的基础。一个批评家具有这样的了解就有可能正确地评价描写生活各方面的作品。此外，一个批评家在其工作中一定要神圣地牢记斯大林同志的关于一个党员应当是对一切都关心的指示。
    其次，没有一个人要求批评家的万能性。批评家的权利——就是在其自己的论文中首先要关心到他所特别深刻研究过和全面熟悉的那些方面。而且相反，谁也不能赋与他万能地说明生活的一切现象和触及一切问题（包括他所不熟悉和他很少研究过的问题）的权利。
    而恰好是最近些年来所发表的许多批评论文正苦于缺乏对现实生活的具体认识。
    可以举批评家施凯林的论爱伦堡《暴风雨》的文章（一九四八年第一号《十月》）来做个例子，这篇文章很危险地说明了作者对第二次世界大战准备与进行时期的国际关系的不熟悉，以及对发展了这种关系的具体环境的不熟悉，对俄罗斯苏维埃人对法国共产党员反对希特勒占领者的斗争的英勇的鼓励模范作用的不了解。
    可以举瓦日达耶夫的关于批评布希敏的《法捷耶夫的〈毁灭〉中的思想形像概念》一文（一九四九年第三号《新世界》）的论文为例子，在这篇论文里面同时既表现出对远东游击活动特点的知识是表面的，又表现出不了解对于一个批评家来说把作品的思想分析和艺术分析结合起来的必要性。
    可以举别廖佐夫的论儿童文学的文章（一九四九年第七号《十月》）为例子，在那篇文章里，明显地看到作者毫不关心苏维埃儿童和苏维埃儿童文学的教育任务。
    还可以举这样一个例子，马卡洛夫论波列沃依的中篇小说《归来》（一九四九年第五十八号《文学报》）的文章，批评家在文章里面指出了波列沃依小说中的一些部分的缺陷，不能掌握生动的材料，没有看出小说的严重缺陷——对于生产，对于先进工厂中炼钢的革新过程的描写是不正确的和不对头的。
    党报屡次强调，如果苏维埃的批评想要成为苏维埃文学发展的动力，它就一定要从事于对作品的艺术的分析，帮助作者技巧的稳步提高。
    然而很多很多我们的批评家直到现在还没有根据这些指示给自己做出必要的结论。苏维埃文学作品的批评常常是带有公告的性质的。在许多论说和文章中都是说作者的思想很好，构思很正确，作者是站在思想正确的立场上，他描写了优秀的苏维埃人，那就是仅仅说明作者思考过，他描写了所思考过的人，但是并没有说明他是如何完成自己的构思，如何塑造自己的人物。在这一类论文中对作品的艺术分析仿佛地位不很重要，只在论文的尾巴上出现，形成照例地指出几处小缺陷的结束语。
    罗塞里司在讨论伊万·李亚博克里亚契的讲述一个普通的集体农民的小说（一九四九年第四号《新世界》）时，很少谈到作品的艺术价值，一句缺点也没有谈到。然而照罗塞里司自己的话，是在评论《一个青年乌克兰作家的处女作！》茹奇珂夫在评论卡林琴珂的中篇小说《堪察加的朋友们》（一九四九年第五号《十月》）时仅限于叙述小说的内容。文章中根本没有对艺术形式的分析。对这个问题仅仅谈到的三句话，是不能算作讲论小说的艺术价值的：“小说读起来很容易。作者用简单的，大众化的语言讲述了生活的真理。唯一的（重点是文章作者西蒙诺夫加的）值得责难的地方，——这就是在小说中所遇到的许多地方，用语缺少正确的翻译。”这不太客气吗，一个苏维埃作家需要这一类的自由主义吗？布拉伊妮娜对于古里亚的中篇小说《善良城》（一九四九年第七号《旗帜》）匠心独用地写了一整篇赞美的文章，里面批评家的全部任务都指向一件事——就是重述这本有趣的、然而根本还没有摆脱缺点的小说的内容。
    这一类的评论本质上是一种伪装的对作品真正批评的逃避，逃避回答作者如何处理自己的任务问题。如果注意地分析一下这些论文的结构，再想一想文章的作者们是如何在了解形式与内容的问题，那末就很清楚，这类文章的结构是彻底形式化的（彻底的形式主义！）。文章的作者们对形式和内容的相互关系了解是不正确的，毫无道理地使两者互相脱节：开头只讲述到内容，对在这篇具体作品中这种内容所采用了的那种艺术形式根本不加以分析，然后在结束语中就只检查作品中的个别形式上的缺点，使它们脱离开事物的内容，脱离开所描写的现实生活，脱离开作者的思想立场。
    许多批评家不明白，对一篇作品的批评不仅要从分析其艺术缺陷的观点出发，而且还要从分析其艺术成就的观点出发的必要性。这一类的批评家不指出艺术成就，不分析它们，这样也就是说不指出其好的，正确的方面，不指出作者在其未来作品中应当努力的方向，他们不过尽了对作品来说是毫无感情的旁观者的作用，一个苏维埃的批评家是不应当成为一个旁观者（从坏的意思上去了解这个词），而是应当成为在生活上和文学上为党的事业而斗争的战士！
    文学理论的远离批评界是特别令人难以忍受的。
    一个埋首于档案中，忽视现代的艺术作品的文学理论家，对于自己的学者任务了解得很狭隘，忘记掉斯大林同志号召我们的科学不能和生活隔离开，而是要面对人民的必需要求的话。譬如说，谁在妨碍我们的异常熟悉俄罗斯诗歌及其历史的古德济教授来写一本有关像依萨考甫斯基那样的伟大苏维埃诗人的著作呢，而恰恰是直到现在，对于这个诗人我们的批评界并未写过任何一篇认真的，适合于他在苏维埃诗歌中所占据地位的文章。
    在许多场合，对作品缺少艺术的分析，不仅是和批评家对自己的任务了解不正确有关，不仅是和他的缺少应有的业务天才和职业技巧有关，也说明了许多无原则的，小宗派的，友谊的想法，在这种场合由于不愿批评这一篇或另外的一篇作品就故意放松了对艺术的分析。
    这类批评就是在《戏剧》杂志上所发表的许多论文的特点。阿布拉莫夫的一篇题名为《未来的道路》——论苏洛夫的《绿色的街》的（一九四九年第一号），无限称赞的，然而却一字未涉及批评的文章，就是属于这一类的文章。匝哈洛夫的一篇《新的感觉》——论苏洛夫的三个剧本（一九四九年第八号）的文章，也同样具有这样的称赞性质，几几乎是完全宽恕了缺点和缺乏对艺术技巧的分析。
    对于《自己的》作者们——首先是包括编辑和编委会的委员们——的无限制的称扬，最近几年来在《十月》杂志的批评和书评栏内所刊载的许多文章和论述都有这种特点。不久以前党报上曾经举出了刊登在《十月》杂志上的，这类批评的例子。现在不得不又回到这个问题上来，是因为杂志的编辑部直到现在还没有利用报纸的指示对自己做出认真的结论。
    《十月》杂志的编辑部，无论如何是不愿对批评表示反应的。在杂志的实际工作中，发生了对于我们的艺术和社会政治科学杂志来说简直是破格的事件：第十一号《十月》以文艺选集的形式出版了，是由三篇作品编成的：把杂志主编潘菲约洛夫的长篇小说《伟大的艺术》全部刊完，把另外的一个长篇续完和登一个剧本，批评和书评一栏在这一期内就完全没有。在后来的第十二号和第一号两期内，编辑部同样没有刊登编委会的直接说明，也没有刊登具有特殊明显的党的原则和深刻的艺术分析的文章来答复报纸的批评，只有刊登那些文章才可以证明编辑部已经根据对其错误的批评进行了实际的总结。
    一九五○年第二号杂志内，编辑部刊登了一篇别里克的文章，其主要内容是企图对不久之前在《真理报》上批评了《十月》杂志的批评家塔拉仙科夫的全部文学工作给以毁灭性的粉碎的反驳。当然，塔拉仙科夫的文学活动是具有不少严重错误和谬见的，也应当和其他任何一个批评家一样受到批评。然而别里克在《十月》杂志上所发表的那篇批评其工作的文章中所具有的那种偏见，是令人望而生疑的，在这种场合就迫使怀疑到文章作者的诚实性。
    在别里克的文章中不仅批评到塔拉仙科夫的若干真正错误，而显然是牵强附会地批评一些假想的错误。例如，从塔拉仙科夫的文章中引用了一些句子，其中确定地说苏维埃文学“在人类艺术的发展上是向前迈进一步……”所以“我们一定要不断地强调新的质的阶段，用社会主义现实主义的方法把艺术提高到这个阶段，”别里克很显然在歪曲着，和他自己所引用的句子完全矛盾，由他亲手所加上的“仅仅”这个字眼帮助之下来曲解塔拉仙科夫的文章的意思。他写着：“因此我们认为塔拉仙科夫的，关于苏维埃文学在人类艺术的发展上仅仅向前迈进一步的意见是错误的。塔拉仙科夫论据的错误是由于说在苏维埃文学中（到底是在什么人的身上，或在什么作品中？——作者原注）否定了性质上属于新的东西——社会主义文学的本质，或者，照批评家的意见，它只不过是逐渐向前发展，也就是还不过仅仅前进了一步。”
    不难确信，这种虚伪的控诉是和别里克那篇大文中一个字也未触及到我们党报对《十月》杂志批评部所作的批评那种情况是有关联的。
    所有列举的这一切和《十月》杂志的编委会还没有直接对着党报对该杂志批评部的若干缺点所做的批评加以表白这一点结合起来，就可以令人认为在别里克的文章中是具有一种伪装的，和作者进行清算的企图，因为这位作者发表了一篇批评《十月》杂志批评部实际上有许多不健康现象的文章。
    不是全部我们的文学机关刊物的编辑部都了解，在自己所办的刊物上对主编和编委的自吹自擂和自我宣传是要降低这些刊物，而且和苏维埃人所具有的那种自我评价的谦逊态度是相矛盾的。
    《苏维埃艺术》报也具有这种缺点，例如，仅仅在一九四九年第十六期这一期内，就玩弄了许多次花头，恭恭敬敬地在各种文章里都提到报纸编委苏洛夫的姓名：在社论里，在匝满斯基的《和英雄的会晤》一文里，在大事记里也提到两次。此外，在这一期报纸里还有两篇文章——马卡洛夫的《未来的呼吸》和纳兹万诺夫的《创造的快乐》——是谈论他们在苏洛夫的剧里所扮演的角色的。同时，在《苏维埃艺术》报上对桑德罗·山希阿士维里的获得一九四九年斯大林奖金的剧本，却没有地方发表讲述这些剧本的文章。
    的确，在这儿还应当提醒一次：要加强谦逊态度。
    不久前才开完的苏联作家协会的全体会议，在我们的文学社会生活中起了积极作用。全体会议显然地表示，只要如党所要求的，一展开批评与自我批评，自我批评在我们文学的发展上就成为很巨大的动力，只要一忘掉这些原则，那末在文学的生长上就起反作用。
    全体会议揭发了在苏联作家协会中的还没有消灭的友情关系，揭发了在《十月》杂志编辑部内的无原则的小宗派团体，揭发了戏剧委员会及莫斯科剧作家支会工作的混乱，它们没有执行在击溃了反爱国主义批评分子集团以后对它们所提出的任务。
    在会议上举出的对卡塔耶夫的长篇小说《拥护苏维埃政权》的例子中，揭发出《新世界》杂志编辑部方面缺少对文学作品的必需的要求。应当说，在卡悦林的长篇小说《公开的书》的第一部中是具有许多本质上的缺点，对于编辑部的没有把自己对作者的工作做完，表现了急性病，发表了未彻底成熟的作品一点来说，这是绝对的证据。会议指出，在《文学报》的编委会工作中缺乏自我批评，该报编辑部企图不谈自己的错误，在报纸的工作上缺少充分的原则路线。
    全体会议指出，作家协会的领导机关——书记处和主席团——在最近几年粉饰了若干尖锐的问题，没有发展批评。
    全体会议指出，我们的若干杂志和《文学报》只看做对世界主义分子的斗争不过是一个战役，并没有倾听党的要求，站在高度思想的立场上残酷地批评这种资产阶级意识的表现。
    有一些同志们不正确地了解，认为全部世界主义只不过引起对反对苏维埃戏剧的若干进步作品的反爱国主义批评分子集团给与猛烈的抨击，把反爱国主义批评分子集团击溃，就可以算做对世界主义的斗争已经结束。
    世界主义是美国帝国主义的军事统治意识形态，它是企图统一全世界民族，铲除它们的民族基础，迫使它们服从自己的意志的。自然，对这种敌视我们的意识形态的现象进行斗争，是一种严重的斗争，是一种在目前还要展开广泛战线进行的斗争。世界主义分子的突击，他们企图影响文学的阴谋——用伪装的方式，而有时也用完全公开的方式——直到现在还继续进行。由这种观点来看，特别应当毅然决然地批判柯瓦连科夫同志在会议上所做的错误演讲，这篇演讲对充满了很明显的世界主义谬见的格林的作品进行直接辩护。
    全体会议指出，作家协会的机关刊物进行了许多次毫无结果的讨论（《十月》杂志上的关于威谢洛甫斯基的不必要的和无原则的讨论，《文学报》上的关于马雅柯甫斯基的讨论），而且有时在这些讨论中间，把自己的若干篇幅刊登一些不必要的和有害的争论文章。同时苏联作家协会的机关刊物对出版的许多书籍却很少发表真正的，确具原则性的，不顾情面的分析，对文学上的许多必要问题也很少发表创造性的，具有党的热情的评论。如众周知，如果“没有创造性的讨论，没有批评与自我批评，——那末也就不能有前进的运动。创造性的讨论和客观的，独立的批评——这已经成定理了——是创作发展的重要条件。哪儿没有批评和创造性的讨论，哪儿的发展源泉就枯竭掉，陈腐和停滞的温床也就会生根………”（日丹诺夫在联共（布）中央所召开的苏联音乐工作者大会上的演讲）。
    作家协会及其书记处与主席团，若干杂志，《文学报》都面对着根据那种在全体会议上所发表的对它们工作的公正批评布尔什维克式地进行原则性总结的必要性。
    作家协会，若干杂志和《文学报》是应当根据党在其若干历史文件中和党报的若干论文中给与我们文学的发展批评的清楚纲领来自我批判地对其工作加以评价的。
    然而责备自己工作的缺点还不够，承认自己的错误也不够。摆在作家协会及其领导机构与作家协会一切机关刊物面前的，最主要的，——这就是根据党的指示，制订团结一切文学力量的广泛纲领，根据党的原则性，以与各种小宗派主义的形式和互相宽容的体系进行残酷斗争为基础，制订展开批评与自我批评的广泛纲领。作家协会书记处及其主席团应当以广泛的共同讨论为基础来建立领导作家的整个工作。
    苏维埃文学——世界上最先进的文学——正在向前发展和巩固着。在战争的和战后的若干年月，包括一九四九年在内，它产生了许多在提出和解决若干巨大国家问题上具有特别深刻的党性的艺术作品。
    依靠这些作品，在适应着党的号召，文学批评是应当展开我们文学的未来工作的积极纲领的。文学批评应当顽强地要求苏联作家们遵守布尔什维克党性和提高艺术技巧的原则。对于一本书的分析，在思想内容方面，同时也在艺术技巧方面提出同样的要求，这是可以办到的。
    文学批评一定要经常注意到斯大林同志所说作家是“人类灵魂的工程师”这一指示。斯大林同志这些话强调指出苏维埃文学的积极作用，强调指出苏维埃文学批评在培养苏维埃社会新人物——共产主义建设者——上的积极作用。 （完）
