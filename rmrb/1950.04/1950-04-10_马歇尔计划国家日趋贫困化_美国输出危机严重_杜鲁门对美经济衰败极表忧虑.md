　　Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: Truman's appointment of former Secretary of the Army Gray as a special assistant to the President reflects the White House's extreme concern about the future of the US economy. According to the US Information Service, Truman released a letter he gave to Gray and a memorandum from Presidential Secretary Ross on the 3rd. In the letter, Truman explained that Gray's task was to assist him in "fully mobilizing the government's strength and the people's experience and ideas" to solve the huge contraction that US export trade would inevitably encounter. After pointing out that one-third of US exports last year were so-called Marshall Plan goods, Truman expressed concern that as a result of the impoverishment of Marshall Plan nations, the United States would "not be able to continue selling goods to foreign countries, or receive returns on our public and private investments abroad." The simultaneously released Ross memorandum supplemented this issue. The memorandum pointed out that if the United States does not take "vigorous steps," then at the end of the Marshall Plan, "US exports are likely to decline sharply, and our domestic economy may be seriously affected." In fact, since May 1947, US post-war exports have been on a downward trend. The memorandum indicated that despite a large number of Marshall Plan-related exports, the total value of US exports still fell by two billion US dollars in 1948 and another five hundred million US dollars in 1949. By January of this year, it had even created the lowest record since October 1946 (the lowest month after the war). The memorandum also cited three so-called "negative factors" for last year's trade decline: "The decline of our (referring to the United States) own business, the weakening of the financial position of the United Kingdom and the consequent reduction in the purchase of US dollars in the sterling area; and the reduction of US dollar imports by several Latin American countries." That is to say, the United States is now encountering shrinking markets at home and throughout the capitalist world. This is the reason for Gray's appointment. However, it is clear that all of Truman's efforts, like the Marshall Plan, cannot prevent the inevitable trend of US economic decline.

　　马歇尔计划国家日趋贫困化
    美国输出危机严重     
    杜鲁门对美经济衰败极表忧虑
    【新华社九日讯】杜鲁门之任命前陆军部长格雷为总统特别助理，反映了白宫对美国经济前途的极大忧虑。据美国新闻处讯，杜鲁门三日公布他给格雷的一封信和美总统秘书罗斯的一个备忘录。杜鲁门在信中说明，格雷的任务是协助他“充分动员政府的力量和人民的经验与思想”，以解决美国出口贸易必将遭遇到的巨大萎缩。杜鲁门在指出美国去年出口额有三分之一是所谓马歇尔计划货物之后，表示忧虑由于马歇尔计划国家穷困化的结果，美国会“不能继续向外国出售货物，或是在外国获得我们公私投资的报偿”。同时公布的罗斯的备忘录对这问题作了补充的说明。备忘录指出，美国若不采取“有力的步骤”，则在马歇尔计划结束时，“美国的出口很可能急剧减少，我们国内经济可能受到严重影响”。而且，实际上，自从一九四七年五月以来，美国战后的出口就走了下坡路。备忘录指明，尽管有大量属于马歇尔计划的出口，美国出口总额在一九四八年仍下降了二十亿美元，在一九四九年又下降了五亿美元。到今年一月，更造成一九四六年十月（战后最低月份）以来的最低纪录。备忘录并举出了去年贸易低落的三个所谓“消极因素”，即：“我们（指美国）自己商业的衰落，英国财政地位的削弱和随之而来的英镑区美元购买的减少；以及几个拉丁美洲国家减少美元进口”。这就是说，美国现在在国内以及资本主义世界各地，都碰到了萎缩的市场。这就是格雷之任命的原因。但是，显然地，杜鲁门这一切努力，像马歇尔计划一样，阻止不了美国经济衰败的必然趋势。
