Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: TASS reports that the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is currently compiling Chinese dictionaries and textbooks for use in higher education institutions. The first Russian-Chinese dictionary will be published this year. This dictionary is the result of Professor Alekseev's thirteen years of work. The dictionary extensively collects Chinese vocabulary from various historical periods. In addition, a concise Chinese-Russian dictionary of 40,000 words is being compiled under the guidance of Professor Oshanin. These new dictionaries will reflect the enriched Chinese language and include the rich vocabulary from political books of the People's Republic of China, as well as the language from Chairman Mao Zedong's works. The Institute of Oriental Studies is also compiling books such as Chinese grammar, grammar theory courses, and textbooks on the history of the Chinese language.

The Soviet Academy of Sciences and various higher education institutions are training many Sinology cadres. Many researchers have obtained master's degrees in science this year. The papers written by these researchers are all creative studies on Sinology issues, including: Ivanov's "On the Formation of Vocabulary in the Democratic Chinese Language," Mudrov's "The Dual Expression Method in the Chinese Language," Stebuginini's "On Ancient Chinese History," and Vyatkin's "British Imperialism in China," and others.
