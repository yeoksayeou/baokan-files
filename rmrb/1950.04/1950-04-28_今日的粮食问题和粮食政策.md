　　Today's Grain Problem and Grain Policy

　　In the past month and a half, grain prices across the country have been steadily declining. From early March to mid-April, within forty days, in Beijing, the price of rice per jin (approximately 1.1 pounds) fell from 2,635 yuan to 1,818 yuan, a decrease of 31%; millet per jin fell from 1,697 yuan to 1,159 yuan, a decrease of 32%; wheat per jin fell from 1,556 yuan to 1,029 yuan, a decrease of 34%; corn per jin fell from 1,273 yuan to 904 yuan, a decrease of 29%; and vermicelli per bag fell from 94,778 yuan to 83,760 yuan, a decrease of 12%. During the same period, rice prices in Tianjin fell by 31%; millet fell by 39%; wheat and corn each fell by 17%; and vermicelli fell by 11%. In major southern cities, where rice is the staple food, the price of rice during the same period fell by 7% in Shanghai; 29% in Hankou; 32% in Chongqing; 36% in Guangzhou; 39% in Fuzhou; and 40% in Chengdu. Grain prices in Xi'an in the Northwest fell even more, with the local staple food, vermicelli, falling by 58% during the same period, and the secondary staple food, rice, also falling by 46%. Even the Northeast, where prices have been historically stable, was affected by the nationwide decline in grain prices during the same period, with the price of sorghum, the staple food in Shenyang, falling by 8%.

　　This month and a half is precisely the so-called spring famine season; yet grain prices across the country have fallen so universally. This has gradually reassured people who were previously anxious about the grain problem. Their past anxiety was partly due to the severity of last year's disaster, but mainly due to the persecution under long-term reactionary rule. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government, while verbally advocating increased grain production, actually only hindered it. It colluded with foreign forces to suppress the peasant land reform movement with force, forcibly made peasants hand over more than half of their harvest to landlords without compensation, forced peasants to accept the cruel exploitation of exorbitant taxes and levies as well as usurious capital, forcing peasants to work all year round, barely able to fill their stomachs, unable to maintain their simple reproduction, let alone expand reproduction. At the same time, it encouraged foreign rice and flour to be dumped in major coastal cities at prices lower than domestic rice and flour, making it difficult for farmers to find a sufficient market for the grain they produced through their hard work throughout the year, resulting in "disaster from good harvests" in the inland areas, while many acres in coastal provinces abandoned grain production and switched to growing other crops. It also engaged in water conservancy; but its so-called water conservancy was only a way to encroach on the people's wealth. The water conservancy it destroyed was more than the water conservancy it built. Therefore, after twenty-one years of water conservancy, the only thing seen was more and more floods, which eventually led to the major floods in East China and North China that broke out more than two months after its downfall. It also talked about dredging grain sources; but on the one hand, it allowed feudal landlords and speculative merchants to hoard and speculate on the grain they had plundered from the peasants, manipulating the grain market; on the other hand, it allowed local bureaucrats and gentry to control local grain, hindering grain adjustment between provinces, counties, and even villages. Therefore, every year when the old grain ran out and the new grain was not yet available, the grain problem threatened the general population; especially in years of famine, it is only natural that the general population would unconsciously have this kind of anxious psychology.

　　However, today's people's government's grain policy is completely opposite to the past reactionary government's grain policy. The past reactionary government's grain policy was to collude with foreign forces, deceive the people, and exploit the people. Today's people's government's grain policy is based on the principle of self-reliance, and it solves the actual grain problems of the general population in a practical, planned, and step-by-step manner.

　　First, it is doing its best to relieve disasters. Last year, East China, North China, and Central China suffered severe natural disasters; and due to the past aggression of Japanese imperialism and the launch of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war by American imperialism, and due to the corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, dykes were destroyed, and reserves were exhausted, thus the people's strength was greatly weakened, and the disaster situation became more serious. At the beginning of the disaster, the people's governments at all levels led the people to cooperate fully and fight against the disaster. On the one hand, they fought drought and planted; braved the rain to rush to the rescue; then drained water and planted wheat; and arranged for spring plowing. At the same time, they built water conservancy projects, used labor as relief; organized rural side businesses, first lent grain to producers and then collected finished products, first lent goods to transporters and then collected payment; and supplemented it with necessary relief. This quickly reduced the disaster area and greatly shortened the disaster time. The amount of grain used by the people's government to relieve disaster victims inside the pass alone included eight items, namely relief grain, water conservancy labor relief grain, agricultural loan grain, cooperative relief grain, disaster victim transportation freight grain, grain purchased with disaster victim's homespun cloth, grain borrowed by farmers to be repaid after the wheat harvest, and local relief grain, totaling 766,000 tons. Last year's disaster had 12 million fewer disaster victims and 36 million fewer mu (approximately 6 million acres) of disaster-stricken land than the disaster in 1931 during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the relief grain delivered to the disaster area, the part used inside the pass alone, was 200,040 tons more than that year. Therefore, the people in the disaster area have all successfully survived the winter famine; and the spring famine has also been basically overcome.

　　Second, it has implemented thorough measures to increase grain production. It is promoting rural land reform in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the specific circumstances of various regions. Land reform has now been completed for a population of 150 million and 600 million mu of cultivated land. Farmers in areas where land reform has been completed can be completely free from land rent and exorbitant taxes and levies as well as the exploitation of usurious capital; areas where land reform has not been implemented have also implemented various measures such as rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies. And within the national scope, various important projects such as closing breaches and restoring embankments, seawall projects, culvert projects, reservoir projects, dredging projects, harnessing projects, irrigation projects, and the renovation of ditches are being carried out. Furthermore, it is organizing farmers' mutual assistance and cooperation through democratic means. In this way, on the one hand, realistic and feasible production increase plans are formulated; on the other hand, farmers are indeed able and enthusiastic to realize these production increase plans. Last year's grain production was only roughly close to the normal yield after the Japanese surrender; while this year's grain production is expected to increase by 5,040,000 tons compared to the normal yield after the Japanese surrender.

　　Third, it has also implemented concrete measures to control farmers' surplus grain. It has abolished the past reactionary government's system of exorbitant taxes and levies on agricultural land production, which were collected an unknown number of times a year under various names; and replaced it with a single agricultural tax - namely, the collection of public grain. Progressive or non-progressive tax systems are adopted separately in areas where land reform has not been completed or has been completed, so that landlords and peasants in various regions can reasonably share the public grain; at the same time, the surplus grain produced by local farmland can be mainly controlled by the people's government, used for the people's interests, and not hoarded and speculated by feudal landlords and speculative merchants, harming the public. A portion of the public grain collected in this way will be sold on the market, and this year alone, 4,500,000 tons will be sold inside the pass, which is enough to supply the annual food grain for more than one-third of the population in large and small cities across the country.

　　Fourth, it has also implemented a plan to comprehensively adjust grain across the country. On the one hand, the surplus grain from the Northeast, Central China, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia is used to adjust East China and North China; at the same time, areas with surplus grain and areas with insufficient grain within each region are mutually adjusted. The areas that receive grain are mainly disaster areas and large cities with dense populations that do not produce grain; the areas that ship out grain are provinces that had relatively good harvests last year and have surplus grain for export in previous years. The quantity, location, and timing of shipments in and out have all been carefully negotiated by all parties concerned. Some areas have surplus grain, which in the past could not be transported and sold due to inconvenient transportation and high freight costs, so the government loses money to transport it out, in order to promote local farmers' production and assist people in other places who need grain. It has organized various transportation methods such as railways, ships, animal-drawn vehicles, and manpower, and transferred tens of thousands of cadres, preparing to subsidize the cost of tens of thousands of tons of millet to engage in this national adjustment work. Such a great grain adjustment work is certainly not something that the past Kuomintang reactionary government was willing to do or could do.

　　Fifth, recently, the Central People's Government has also stipulated measures to increase the quality and quantity of edible grain. It stipulates that "92 rice" and "81 flour" should be the grain processing standards, and calls on the general urban residents to abandon the unhealthy and uneconomical habit of eating refined white rice and second-class flour. If this method can be quickly and widely adopted, not only can the physical health of the general urban residents be greatly improved, but also the quantity of edible grain supplied can be greatly increased. Counting large cities alone, it can be increased by at least 400,000 tons or more.

　　After more than half a year of efforts by the government and the people, the largest flood since 1931 that was suffered last year has been basically overcome, the grain price that has led the price increase since last year has gradually decreased; the grain controlled by the government is completely sufficient to supply the needs of disaster areas and large, medium, and small cities across the country before the autumn harvest; "eight, ten, three, field rains" have all fallen thoroughly, and the wheat harvest is guaranteed; at the same time, the work of increasing grain production, allocating, and improving quality are all in active progress; the national grain problem this year has been basically solved. The current problem is to complete all the above-mentioned ongoing work. This depends on the efforts of all of us.

　　Now a few people do not fully understand the significance of comprehensively adjusting grain across the country, especially some people in areas that are to ship out grain. They are only afraid that if the central government transfers a portion of the public grain, it will hinder their grain supply. This may have been possible in the past reactionary rule era. But under today's people's regime, the quantity of public grain that it transfers will never exceed the quantity that they have exported in previous years. If this portion of public grain is not transported to disaster areas and large cities according to plan, then on the one hand, because it competes with the grain stored in the hands of farmers in the local area for sale, it will cause the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers," making local farmers suffer; at the same time, because the industry in large cities cannot get a sufficient supply of grain, the cost increases, which will make the general population suffer from the high prices of industrial products. Moreover, excessive grain storage in surplus grain areas will cause the phenomenon of wasting grain at will. Watching the people in other areas starve, while their own area wastes grain at will, or keeps it without using it, is not an attitude that we should have. If the surplus grain areas do not try their best to adjust disaster areas and large cities, it will inevitably force the government to purchase a large amount of foreign rice and flour beyond its plan. But the purchase of foreign rice and flour requires foreign exchange, and if we use one more foreign exchange to purchase foreign rice and flour, we will use one less foreign exchange to purchase machinery and raw materials for industry. This will greatly hinder the prospects of China's industrialization. This is detrimental to all of us. If this idea is not understood, it will not only hinder the timely completion of the national grain allocation work, but also affect the country's entire financial and economic plan.

　　At the same time, many urban residents are not very willing to adopt standard rice and flour. It is indeed difficult to change old habits of many years in a short time. But for our own health, for the family economy, and more importantly for the national economy and people's livelihood, we should and must make this change. Now urban residents generally like to eat refined rice and refined flour, abandoning a large number of fats, minerals, and vitamins in rice and wheat bran. This is really an uneconomical and unhygienic method. Therefore, northerners generally eat coarser grain than southerners, and their bodies are generally stronger than southerners, and rural farmers in the south generally eat coarser rice than urban residents, and their bodies are generally stronger than urban residents. The Soviet people generally like to eat black bread. At the same time, countries such as Britain, the United States, and Canada are also promoting the production of 85 jin of all-purpose flour from every 100 jin of standard wheat. And our standard flour is only producing 81 jin of all-purpose flour from every 100 jin of standard wheat. The nutritional components of brown rice are originally higher than those of white rice, but because the surface of brown rice is rich in cellulose, which is not easy to digest, it must be milled. But it only needs to be milled slightly, and the outer skin of brown rice is mostly removed, and it can be eaten. The rice made in this way is standard rice, which is rich in nutrition and easy to digest. If the milling is too heavy and too much, from one machine rice to two machine rice, to three machine rice, the so-called refined white rice, then the digestion is indeed easy, but the nutritional components are also greatly reduced - about 40% less minerals such as phosphorus, iron, and calcium, 70% less fat, and 60% to 100% less various vitamins. At the same time, the output of rice is also greatly reduced, standard rice can produce 92 jin per 100 jin of pure brown rice, while refined white rice can only produce 86 jin per 100 jin of pure brown rice. This difference of 6 jin per 100 jin, for us personally, of course, in addition to suffering a loss in nutrition, we also have to suffer a loss of 10% in price according to the current market price, while the country suffers a greater loss. Now the national urban population with rice as the main food is about 58 million, and if each person eats an average of at least 5 he (approximately 0.5 liters) of rice per day, the annual total demand is 105.85 million shi (approximately 5.3 million tons). Among them, if two-thirds are estimated to be refined white rice, and the brown rice required to make this two-thirds is converted to standard rice, 4.93 million shi can be increased. That is, about 370,000 tons of edible grain can be increased. Now the country is organizing all forces to allocate and transport grain for the sake of our urban residents, so how can our urban residents abandon this 370,000 tons of edible grain at will? If our urban residents can generally change to eating standard rice and wheat, at least 2.9 million more people can be supported without increasing the quantity of grain supply. This is completely a matter that benefits both others and ourselves, so what can we hesitate about?

　　Twenty-one years of Kuomintang reactionary rule and twelve years of war damage have greatly reduced national grain production, which has decreased by 20.8% compared with before the war. Not to mention that last year's grain production was only close to the normal production after the Japanese surrender; even if this year's production increase plan is fully realized, it will still be 8.7% lower than before the war. It will take two or three years of our efforts to restore the pre-war grain production level. But we now have favorable conditions for adjusting grain and saving grain that we did not have before the war. We have our own strong government; we have created an unprecedented unified situation and eliminated all remnants of feudal separatism. We now have 30% more railways than before the war. All national railway trunk lines have been completely opened to traffic, and even the Yuehan Railway, which was destroyed as soon as it opened to traffic before the war, has been repaired. Therefore, we can adjust grain across the country in a planned way and definitely complete the plan; we can transport out grain that could not be transported out before. This quantity is not small. Along the Zhegan Railway and the Yuehan Railway alone, there is at least 300,000 tons of such grain; and Sichuan Province alone has at least 200,000 tons. At the same time, we have recovered the Northeast, the largest surplus grain area in China. It was given to Japanese imperialism by the Kuomintang reactionary government before the war. It has always exported a large amount of grain, which used to be exported to Japan, but now it can be imported into the pass. This year, 1.03 million tons have been imported, and it can be increased if necessary. And more importantly, we already have conscious and organized people who can automatically increase grain production and save grain. As mentioned above, simply a part of the residents in large cities changing to eating 92 rice and 81 flour can save more than 400,000 tons of grain. We must fully utilize these favorable conditions, cooperate with the government, and realistically deal with our grain problem.

　　今日的粮食问题和粮食政策
    最近一个半月来，全国各地粮价都不断稳步下跌。从三月上旬到四月中旬四十天内，北京大米，每斤从二、六三五元跌到一、八一八元，跌去百分之三一；小米每斤从一、六九七元跌到一、一五九元，跌去百分之三二；小麦每斤从一、五五六元跌到一、○二九元，跌去百分之三四；玉米每斤从一、二七三元跌到九○四元，跌去百分之二九；通粉每袋从九四、七七八元跌到八三、七六○元，跌去百分之一二。同时期内，天津大米跌落百分之三一；小米跌落百分之三九；小麦玉米各跌落百分之一七；通粉跌落百分之一一。南方各大都市都以大米为主要食粮，在同时期内，当地大米价格，上海跌落百分之七；汉口跌落百分之二九；重庆跌落百分之三二；广州跌落百分之三六；福州跌落百分之三九；成都跌落百分之四○。西北西安的粮价跌得更多，当地主要食粮的通粉在同时期内跌落百分之五八；次要食粮的大米也跌落百分之四六。就是物价一向稳定的东北，也在同时期内，因受到全国粮价跌落的影响，沈阳主要食粮的高粱价格跌落百分之八。
    这一个半月正是所谓春荒时节；而全国粮价如此普遍下降。因此使过去对粮食问题惶惶不安的人们都渐渐安心下来。它们过去的所以惶惶不安，一方面固由于去年灾情的严重，而主要地是长期反动统治迫害的结果。过去国民党反动政府虽口说要增产粮食，但它实际所做的却只是妨碍粮食生产。它勾引外力以武力压制农民土地改革运动，强制农民以其过半数的收获毫无代价地交给地主，强制农民接受苛杂勒索以及高利贷资本的残酷剥削，迫使农民终年劳动，难得一饱，无法维持其简单再生产，更说不上扩大再生产。同时它鼓励洋米洋面以低于国产米面的价格在沿海各大都市倾销，使得农民终年辛苦所出产的粮食找不到足够市场，弄成内地“丰收成灾”，而沿海各省不少地亩都放弃粮食生产改种他物。它也办水利；但它所谓办水利，只是借口侵蚀民脂民膏的一种方法。它所破坏的水利，更多于它所修建的水利。所以办了二十一年的水利，只见水灾愈来愈多，最后便酿成了它倒台之后两个多月所爆发的华东和华北的大水灾。它也说疏通粮源；但它一方面放纵封建地主投机商人把它们从农民那里所掠夺得来的粮食，囤积居奇，操纵粮市；一方面任凭地方官僚豪绅把持本地粮食，阻碍省与省间，县与县间，甚至乡与乡间的粮食调剂。因此，每年一到青黄不接的时际，粮食问题便威胁着一般人民；尤其在有灾荒年份，一般人民就不自觉地会有这种惶惶不安的心理，这也是很自然的。
    但是，今日人民政府的粮食政策已和过去反动政府的粮食政策完全相反。过去反动政府的粮食政策是勾引外力，欺骗人民，剥削人民。而今日人民政府的粮食政策却是根据自力更生的原则，切切实实地有计划有步骤地替一般人民解决实际粮食问题。
    第一，它以全力抢救灾荒。去年华东、华北、华中都遭受着严重的天灾；而由于过去日本帝国主义的侵略和美帝国主义的发动蒋匪内战，更由于蒋匪政权的腐烂，渠堤破坏，蓄藏搜光，因此民力大大减弱，灾情更趋严重。各级人民政府，在灾荒一开始时，便领导人民，通力合作，与灾荒作斗争。一方面抗旱点种；冒雨抢险；接着排水种麦；布置春耕。同时兴修水利，以工代赈；组织农村副业，对生产者先行贷粮后收成品，对贩运者先行贷货后收货款；并辅之以必要的救济。这样使灾区迅速缩小，灾时大大缩短。人民政府因救济关内灾民所用的粮食数量，便有救济粮、水利工赈粮、农贷粮、合作救济粮、灾民运输运价粮、收买灾民土布粮、借给农民粗粮待麦收归还的粮、地方救济粮等八项、共七十六万六千吨。去年灾荒比国民党反动统治时代一九三一年的灾情，灾民少一千二百余万人，灾田少三千六百余万亩，而运达灾区的救济粮食，单单用于关内的部分，就要比那年多二十万零四十吨。因此使灾区人民都胜利地渡过冬荒；而春荒也已基本克服。
    第二，它实行了增产粮食的彻底办法。它按照各地具体环境，有计划有步骤地推进农村土地改革。现已有一亿五千万人口和六亿亩耕地完成土改。完成了土改地区的农民已可完全免除地租和苛杂勒索以及高利贷资本的剥削；没有实行土改的地区也实行了减租，减息，取消苛杂勒索等各种办法。并在全国范围内，兴修各项重要堵口复堤工程、海塘工程、涵闸工程、水库工程、疏浚工程、治导工程、灌溉工程，以及沟渠的整修工程。更通过民主方式组织农民互助合作。如此，一面订立切实可行的增产计划；一面使农民确实有能力，也有热忱，来实现这增产计划。去年粮食生产仅约略和日本投降后常年产量相接近；而今年粮食生产则预期可比日本投降后常年产量还增加五百零四万吨。
    第三，它又实行了掌握农民余粮的具体办法。它取消了过去反动政府一年不知道要多少次用多少种名目来征取农地出产的苛杂勒索制度；而代之以单一的农业税——即征收公粮——的办法。分别在土改未完成或已完成的地区采用累进的或非累进的税制，使各地地主农民都可合理分担公粮；同时使当地农田所出产的余剩粮食可以主要地掌握在人民政府手里，为人民利益而运用，而不为封建地主投机商人所囤积居奇，为害大众。如此所征收的公粮，一部分将在市场出售，今年单单关内部分，就要出售四百五十万吨，足以供应全国大小城镇三分之一以上人口的全年食粮。
    第四，它更实行通盘调剂全国粮食的计划。一方面以东北、华中、西南、内蒙的余粮调剂华东、华北；同时使各区内部的粮食有余的和粮食不足的地区互相调剂。调入粮食的地区主要是灾区和人口密集而又不生产粮食的大城市；调出粮食的地区便是去年收成较好历年又有余粮出境的省分。调出调入的数量、地点、时间都经过有关各方缜密商定。有些地区的余粮，过去向因交通不便，运费昂贵，不能外运销售，政府便赔钱把它运出，以促进当地农民生产，并援助外处需用粮食的人们。它组织了铁路、船舶、兽车、人力等各种运输，抽调了上万个干部，准备赔贴几十万吨小米的代价，以从事这全国调剂工作。这样伟大的粮食调剂工作自不是过去国民党反动政府所肯做，所能做的。
    第五，最近中央人民政府又规定了增加食用粮食的质和量的办法。规定以“九二米”“八一面”为粮食加工标准，号召一般城市居民放弃吃食精白米和二等粉的不卫生不经济的习惯。这一办法，如能迅速普遍采用，就不但一般城市居民的身体健康可以大大改善，而且食用粮食的供应数量也可大大增加。单单以大城市计，就最少可增加四十万吨以上。
    经过了政府和人民半年以上的努力，去年所遭受的一九三一年以来最大的水灾已经基本上克服，自从去年以来领导物价上涨的粮价已经逐步下降；政府手里所掌握的粮食已完全足以供应秋收以前全国灾区和大中小城镇的需要；“八、十、三，场雨”都已普遍落透，麦收已有保障；同时粮食增产、调拨、以及提高质量的工作都已在积极进行；今年的全国粮食问题基本上已经解决。现在的问题就是要把上述进行中的各项工作全部加以完成。这就在乎我们大家的努力。
    现在有少数人对于通盘调剂全国粮食的意义还了解得不够充分，特别是有些在要调拨出粮食地区的人们。他们只怕中央把一部分公粮调走了，会妨碍他们的粮食供给。这在过去反动统治时代是可能有这种现象的。但在今日人民政权底下，它所调出的公粮数量决不会超过他们那里历年出口的数量。这一部分公粮，如果不按照计划运去灾区和大城市，则一方面因为它在当地与农民手里的存粮竞争出卖，会造成“谷贱伤农”的现象，使当地农民吃亏；同时因为大城市的工业，得不到充分粮食供给，成本提高，更会使一般人民都受到工业品过贵的苦处。而且余粮区存粮过多，会造成把粮食随便浪费现象。看着其它地区人民挨饿，而自己地区把粮食随便浪费，或存着不用，这也不是我们应有的态度。如果余粮区不尽量调剂灾区和大城市，势将迫使政府超过其计划地大量购进洋米洋面。但是购进洋米洋面是需要外汇的，我们多用一个外汇去购买洋米洋面，就少去一个外汇去购买工业用的机器原料。如此便将大大妨害我国工业化的前途。这是对我们大家不利的。这思想不搞通，不但会妨碍全国粮食调拨工作的如期完成，而且会影响国家整个财经计划。
    同时有不少的城市居民还不甚愿意采用标准米面。多年的老习惯一时改变确是有困难的。但是我们为着自身健康，为着家庭经济，而更重要地是为着国计民生，都应该而且必须有此改变。现在城镇居民都一般爱吃精米精面，把米麦中极大数量的脂肪矿物质和维生素都抛弃在米秕麦麸中。这实是不经济而又不卫生的办法。所以，北方人吃粮一般比南方人粗，而身体也一般比南方人强，南方乡村农民吃米一般比城市居民粗，而身体也一般比城市居民强。苏联人民一般爱吃黑面包。同时英、美、加拿大等国也正在推行每百斤标准麦出产八十五斤的通粉。而我们的标准粉还只是每百斤标准麦出产八十一斤的通粉。糙米的营养成份原比白米高，但因糙米表皮较富纤维素，不易消化，故必须加以碾制。可是只须略略碾制，将糙米外皮大部除去，便可食用。这样所制成的便是标准米，既富营养，又易消化。若碾制太重和太多，由一机米而二机米，而三机米，即所谓精白米，则消化固易，而营养成份也大减——大约磷、铁、钙等矿物质要减少十分之四，脂肪要减少十分之七，各种维生素要减少十分之六到十分之十。同时食米的产量也大减少，标准米每百斤纯净糙米可出产九十二斤，而精白米则每百斤纯净糙米只能出产八十六斤。这每百斤六斤的相差，在我们个人，固然除开受到营养方面的损失外，还要依照目前市价，受到十分之一的价格上的损失，而在国家，则所受损失更大。现在全国以大米为主要食粮的城市人口共约五千八百万，以每人每日最少平均食米五合计，全年共需一○、五八五万石。其中如三分之二估计为精白米，将此三分之二制造所需的糙米改制标准米。便可增产四九三万石。即约可增加三十七万吨的食用粮食。现在国家正为着我们城市居民的粮食，组织一切力量调拨运送，我们城市居民又岂可将此三十七万吨可食之粮随便抛弃？我们城市居民如能普遍改吃标准米麦，则在不增加粮食供应的数量内最少可多养活二九○万人。这完全是利人而又利己的事，我们还有什么可以踌躇的地方？
    二十一年的国民党反动统治和十二年的战争破坏已使全国粮食生产大大降低，已比诸战前降低百分之二○·八。不说去年粮食生产仅接近于日本投降后常年生产；就是今年增产计划全部实现，也还要比战前低去百分之八·七。要恢复战前粮食生产水准，尚须经我们二三年的努力。但是我们现在已有了战前所没有的调剂粮食节用粮食的有利条件。我们已有了自己的强有力的政府；我们已创立了空前的统一局面，扫除了一切封建割据的残余。我们现有的铁路已比战前多十分之三。所有全国铁路干线都已完全通车，连战前刚一通车便遭破坏的粤汉路也已修复。因此，我们可以有计划地，并且能一定完成计划地，调剂全国粮食；可以把以前运不出来的粮食运出来。这一数量是不小的。单单浙赣路粤汉路沿线，这样的粮食就最少有三十万吨；四川一省也最少有二十万吨。同时，我们已收复了中国最大的余粮区的东北。它是战前国民党反动政府所送给日本帝国主义的。它一向有大批粮食出口，以前输出日本，现在可输入关内了。今年已输入了一百○三万吨，必要时还可增加。并且更重要的，是我们已经有了有觉悟有组织的人民，能够自动地增产粮食和节用粮食。如上所述，单单大城市一部分居民改吃九二米八一面，就可节省粮食四十万吨以上。我们必须充分利用这些有利条件，配合着政府，面对现实地，来处理我们的粮食问题。
