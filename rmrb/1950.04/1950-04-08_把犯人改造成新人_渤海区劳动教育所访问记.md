Transforming Criminals into New People
    ——A Visit to the Bohai District Labor Education Center
    Chun Zhi

    The Bohai District Labor Education Center is located in the southeast corner of Huimin City. Recently, many people have come here to visit, including many business and industrial figures from cities like Tianjin and Jinan, as well as many workers, farmers, students, and enlightened gentry from various parts of Bohai. After the visits, they all expressed the same sentiment: this labor education center is completely different from the prisons of the old society; it's like a comprehensive factory. Indeed, there are rows of factories here, with sunny dormitories. The criminals work, study, and sing on time. Everywhere presents a scene of intense labor. Except for the words "Criminal" written on people's backs and the occasional person wearing shackles, it is indeed almost indistinguishable from a large factory.

    This is one of the many labor education centers in the country. It was established in the late spring of 1948 and is directly under the leadership of the Public Security Bureau of the Bohai District Administrative Office of Shandong Province. Initially, most of the criminals from the East China region were concentrated here. At the end of 1948, there were still 558 criminals in the center. In 1949, a total of 1,712 criminals entered the center, and 566 criminals were released upon completion of their terms this year. Currently, there are still 1,704 criminals in the center.

    The Bohai District Labor Education Center's work to reform criminals mainly involves labor, combined with patient and meticulous education, so that criminals can be transformed into new people through labor education. At the beginning of the center's establishment, the scope of criminal labor was very small, with only a carpentry group and a metalworking group, some sewing shoe soles, and repairing roads. In May 1948, large-scale construction of factories and dormitories began. By the autumn of 1949, the construction of nine factories (power generation, metalworking, wickerwork, shoes and clothing, flour, cotton ginning, vermicelli, brick kiln, and burlap bags) and dormitory projects for more than 1,700 criminals had been preliminarily completed. In addition, a construction factory was also established. Since then, the Bohai District Labor Education Center has taken on a new look.

    All the criminals in the center participate in production, and those who don't know how learn from those who do. Originally, only 122 criminals in the center knew some production techniques, but now all 1,704 criminals have learned basic production techniques. Among them, 1,354 criminals have learned specialized production techniques such as metalworking, carpentry, and weaving, and some criminals have learned to repair modern production technologies such as generators.

    On February 5th, in the courtyard of the iron factory of the Bohai District Labor Education Center, Director Jin Houchu, Factory Director Deng Xiaobei of the iron factory, Factory Director Li Jinzhang of the flour mill, and several workers and criminals were testing the flour grinding performance of the newly produced small steel mill. A mule was pulling the small steel mill, rotating with a rustling sound. The criminal next to the worker was also carefully checking and recording its shortcomings, and exchanging opinions on how to improve it. The small steel mill was made by the hands of workers and criminals, and now they are testing and improving it.

    Educating and managing criminals is the responsibility of every cadre in the center, and the Education and Management Section is responsible for carrying out education and management work more systematically. The Education and Management Section has education and management cadres in each factory, who regularly lead criminals in learning, educating criminals to establish labor concepts, learn production skills, and also conduct current affairs, cultural, and future education. The center subscribed to more than 30 copies of the Bohai Daily for criminals to read in rotation. Criminals study for two hours every day, hold a review meeting every seven days to review their understanding of their crimes and the prospect of future reform; they have one day off every ten days, spending the whole day in class studying; each factory has established wall newspapers to promptly publish the criminals' determination to reform, periodic production plans, and opinions on the work, as well as commendations or criticisms of good or bad examples of reform among the criminals. At the same time, study discipline was stipulated to urge criminals to study.

    The center also established a system of rewards and punishments. In 1949, due to the implementation of the reward and punishment system, labor efficiency increased significantly. A wave of learning technology swept through the center, and ten criminals made new improvements and creations in production. Throughout the year, there was one criminal "paroled," 58 criminals had their sentences reduced, and 939 criminals received awards. The criminals' slogan: "Learn from the criminals who are ‘paroled’ and have their sentences reduced, and transform ourselves into new people through labor!" Criminal Zhang Wanhe, originally a hooligan in the old society who did not engage in honest work, entered the center on November 15, 1947, for crimes such as drug trafficking and robbery, with a three-year sentence. Through labor education, he recognized the prospect of labor reform, actively engaged in production, learned technology, has learned skills such as bricklaying and setting up electrical wires, and has received awards twice, having his sentence reduced by six months, and was "paroled" on September 19, 1949. However, he volunteered to continue improving his skills and was unwilling to leave the center, and is now staying in the center as a worker, continuing to produce and study.

    The center also provides considerable care for the criminals' lives, hygiene, and disease treatment management. Behind the rows of criminal dormitories are a health center and a light sickroom; a serious sickroom is located in the southeast corner of the center. When criminals are sick, in addition to medical treatment, they also eat refined grains, and the vegetable budget is doubled. Since last winter, the center has conducted three health checks on the criminals. Among the 1,704 criminals, in addition to 29 with more serious illnesses who are on sick leave and receiving medical treatment, and some criminals suffering from very mild heart, gastrointestinal, bronchitis, venereal diseases, etc., work is also assigned according to their conditions, treatment is given, and care is provided in life. The vast majority of criminals are completely healthy. A large disinfection pot is set up in the center to disinfect clothes with boiling water, and a steam boiler was also set up in winter to steam and disinfect cotton clothes. No infectious diseases have occurred in the center for more than a year. Criminal Zhang Lijie had gangrene in his foot before entering the center, but it has been cured after long-term treatment by the center. He said: "I thought that entering the labor education center with an illness would be the same as being in prison in the old society, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough to wear, and no one would care if I was sick. Once I went in, I would lose my life! I didn't expect the center to take such good care of me. It can truly be counted as a second set of parents."

    Most of the criminals who have completed their terms after labor education and reform go home to engage in production with peace of mind, and some criminals apply to stay in the center to work (currently there are 20 who have been approved). Many people still maintain contact with the labor education center. For example, Li Honglie, a criminal from Wudi County who was released last year, was originally a robber who did not engage in honest work. After being released last year, he engaged in farming at home with peace of mind and also engaged in petty trading. Every time he came to Huicheng to attend the market, he would come to the center to visit. After labor education and reform, the criminals have embarked on a new path in life.

    Through labor, the center not only reformed the criminals but also guaranteed self-sufficiency. The center began to be partially self-sufficient from January 1949, and became fully self-sufficient in July 1949. Over the year, a total of 469 houses were built, 7,541 city feet of walls were constructed, the power plant was repaired, and the power supply problem in Huicheng was solved. According to incomplete statistics, the products of the nine factories reached 154 kinds, and the three factories of metalworking, wickerwork, and shoes and clothing alone produced 77,328 pieces. In 1949, in addition to achieving full self-sufficiency for more than 1,700 people, 735,013 catties of autumn grain production funds were accumulated. In this regard, Director Jin Houchu of the Administrative Office Public Security Bureau, who is responsible for the work of the center, emphasized: "The experience of this center in the past year is that ensuring self-sufficiency and expanding production are the standards for measuring the implementation of the policy of reforming criminals through labor. If self-sufficiency in production cannot be achieved, it means that the policy of reforming criminals through labor has not been implemented well. Self-sufficiency in production is the inevitable result of the implementation of the policy of reforming criminals through labor."

    Currently, the center is further serving agricultural production under the implementation of the policy of reforming criminals through labor and is working on researching and improving various agricultural tools. (Attached pictures)

　　把犯人改造成新人
    ——渤海区劳动教育所访问记
    纯之
    渤海区劳动教育所座落在惠民城的东南角上。最近曾有许多人到这里来参观，包括天津、济南等城市的不少工商界人士，及渤海各地的很多工人、农民、学生和开明绅士，观后都异口同声的发表了这样的观感：这个劳动教育所和旧社会的监狱简直不同，它像一个综合性的大工厂。的确，这里林立着一座座的工厂，有阳光充足的宿舍，犯人们按时工作、学习和歌唱着，到处呈现着一片紧张的劳动景象，除了人们的背上写着“犯人”两字，和偶然看到个别的人带着刑具外，它确实和一个大工厂几乎没有什么区别。
    这是全国许多劳动教育所中的一个。成立于一九四八年春末，属山东省渤海区行政公署公安局直接领导。最初，华东区的大部分犯人都集中在这里，一九四八年底，全所犯人尚有五五八名，一九四九年共入所犯人一、七一二名，今年期满出所犯人五六六名，现全所尚有犯人一、七○四名。
    渤海区的劳动教育所对犯人的改造工作，主要是通过劳动，并对犯人们进行耐心细致的教育，使犯人经过劳动教育变成新人。该所建立之初，犯人劳动范围甚小，只有一个木工组、一个铁工组，有的纳鞋底、修公路等，一九四八年五月，开始了较大规模的工厂和宿舍的建筑，至一九四九年秋，初步完成了发电、铁工、木编、鞋服、面粉、轧花、粉丝、砖窑、麻袋等九座工厂和一、七○○余犯人宿舍工程的建筑，另外还设有营造厂，从此，渤海区劳动教育所换上了新的面貌。
    该所犯人全部参加生产，不会的人就向会的人学习。全所犯人中原仅有一二二名会某些生产技术，现全所一、七○四名犯人都已学会了基本的生产技术。其中有一、三五四名犯人学会了铁工、木工、编织等专门性的生产技术，并有部分犯人学会了修理发电机等近代化的生产技术。
    二月五日，在渤海区劳动教育所铁工厂的院子里，金厚初主任和铁工厂邓虓北厂长，面粉厂李金章厂长，还有几个工人和犯人，正在试验新出厂的小钢磨的磨面效能。一匹骡子在拉着小钢磨沙沙地旋转，在工人旁边的犯人也认真的检查和记录它的缺点，并交换着如何改进的意见。小钢磨是由工人及犯人们的双手制造成的，现在他们又在试验改进它。
    该所管教犯人是全所每一个干部的责任，管教科负责更有系统的进行管教工作。管教科在每一个工厂都设有管教干事，经常领导犯人学习，教育犯人树立劳动观念，学会生产技能，同时进行时事、文化、前途等教育。全所订了三十多份渤海日报，供犯人轮流阅读。犯人们每日两小时学习制，七天一次检讨会，检讨认识自己的罪恶和今后改造的前途；十天休假一天，整日上课学习；各厂犯人都建立了壁报，及时刊出犯人们的改造决心，和定期的生产计划，提出对工作中的意见，并表扬或批评犯人中改造好或坏的事例。同时规定了学习纪律，督促犯人学习。
    该所并确立了奖惩制度。在一九四九年，由于贯彻奖惩制度，劳动效率显著提高。全所掀起学习技术的热潮，并有十个犯人在生产中有了新的改进和创造。全年计有“假释”犯人一名，减刑犯人五十八名，获奖犯人九三九名。犯人们的口号：“向‘假释’和减刑的犯人学习，在劳动中改造成新人”！犯人张万和，原系旧社会中不务正业的流氓分子，因贩卖毒品结伙抢劫等罪行，于一九四七年十一月十五日进入该所，徒刑三年，经劳动教育，认清了劳动改造的前途，积极生产，学习技术，已学会瓦匠及架设电线等技术，并两次受奖，减刑半年，并于一九四九年九月十九日获“假释”。但他志愿继续提高技术，不愿离开该所，现仍留所做工人，继续生产学习。
    该所对犯人的生活卫生，疾病治疗管理也相当周到。在犯人一排排的宿舍后面，设立着卫生所和轻病号室；重病号室另设在该所的东南角上。犯人病了除有医药治疗外，并吃细粮，菜金增加一倍。去冬以来，全所进行了三次犯人健康情况检查，一、七○四名犯人中、除二十九名病较重休工就医外，和部分犯人患有很轻的心脏、肠胃、支气管炎、花柳等病，亦均按病况分配工作，给予治疗，并在生活上予以照顾，绝大部分犯人是完全健康的。所内设置了一个大消毒锅，用沸水煮衣消毒，入冬又设了一个蒸汽锅，为棉衣蒸汽消毒。全所年余未发生过传染病。犯人张立杰，入所前脚上害坏疽病，经该所长期治疗后已痊愈。他说：“自想带病进了劳动教育所，准和旧社会坐监一样，吃不饱，穿不暖，有病没人管，这回一去就没有命了！不料所里对我照顾这么好，真算是再生父母了。”
    经劳动教育改造后满期出所的犯人，绝大部分都回家安心生产，同时有部分犯人申请留所工作（获批准者现有二十名）。很多人并仍与劳动教育所保持着联系。如去年出所的无棣县犯人李洪烈，原系不务正业的抢劫犯，去年出所后在家安心务农，并兼营小商贩，每次来惠城赶集都到所来看看。犯人们经劳动教育改造后开始踏上了新的生活之路。
    该所通过劳动，不仅改造了犯人，还保证了自给。该所自一九四九年一月起开始自给一部，一九四九年七月便全部自给了。年余来，共修筑房屋四六九间，建筑围墙七、五四一市尺，修复了发电厂，解决了惠城供电问题。九座工厂出产品据不完全统计，达一五四种，仅铁工、木编、鞋服三厂即出产品七七、三二八件。一九四九年除了做到一千七百余人的全部自给外，并积累了七三五、○一三斤秋粮的生产资金。对此，负责该所工作的行署公安局金厚初主任强调指出：“本所一年来工作中的体会，保证自给，扩大生产，是衡量执行劳动改造犯人政策的尺度。如果不能作到生产自给，就是劳动改造犯人的政策没有执行好，生产自给是劳动改造犯人政策贯彻的必然结果。”
    现该所正在贯彻劳动改造犯人的政策下，进一步为农业生产服务，并着手研究改进各种农具。（附图片）
