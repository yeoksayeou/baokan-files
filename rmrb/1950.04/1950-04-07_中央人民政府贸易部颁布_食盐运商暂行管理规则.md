The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government Promulgates
Provisional Management Rules for Salt Transporters

[Xinhua News Agency News] In order to unify the supply of salt nationwide and avoid blind transportation and sales leading to imbalances in supply and demand, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has formulated Provisional Management Rules for Salt Transporters, which have been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and authorized for implementation by the China Salt Industry Company. The designated locations for salt transporters to apply for registration are currently the salt industry companies in Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and Guangzhou. The specific date for applying for registration will be announced separately by the China Salt Industry Company. The original text of the rules is as follows:

Provisional Management Rules for Salt Transporters

I. These rules are formulated to avoid blind salt transportation and sales, imbalances in supply and demand, and to achieve planned distribution and normal circulation, while ensuring the needs of the people and taking into account the interests of transporters.

II. The term "transporter" as used in these rules refers to wholesale salt merchants who purchase salt in quantities of 297 dan (approximately half a railcar) or more at a time from salt production sites or large distribution centers near production sites (such as Jinan, Houzui) and transport it to various locations for sale. Based on their different sales ranges, they are divided into intra-regional transporters and inter-regional transporters. Those whose sales range is within the region are intra-regional transporters, and those whose sales range is in two or more regions are inter-regional transporters. The boundaries of the regions are based on the various salt sales regions designated by the Salt Administration Bureau.

III. To unify the management of salt transportation and sales, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, authorizes the China Salt Industry Company (hereinafter referred to as "China Salt Company") to handle the registration of salt transporters and manage their transportation and sales affairs.

IV. Any legitimate merchant of Chinese nationality may apply for registration to engage in the transportation and sales of domestic crude salt, washed salt, and refined salt. Transporters who have already been approved and registered by the Salt Administration Bureau before the promulgation of these rules shall remain valid; however, they must still fill out the detailed information in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII.

V. Both intra-regional and inter-regional transporters must apply for registration with the salt industry company in the production area. Intra-regional transporters shall be approved by the respective salt industry regional companies and reported to China Salt Company for record-keeping; inter-regional transporters shall be submitted by the salt industry regional companies to China Salt Company for approval.

VI. Once a transporter's application for registration is approved, the merchant shall directly apply to the local industrial and commercial administration department for a business license, and may only handle transportation and sales after the original salt industry company that approved the registration has verified it.

　　The deadline for submitting the aforementioned business license for verification is two months for intra-regional transporters and three months for inter-regional transporters from the date of approval of the registration application. Failure to meet the deadline will result in the revocation of their transporter qualification.

VII. Transporter registration shall not be done under a false name or using the name of another registered entity, and shall not sell the business name or purchase and transport on behalf of others. Violations will be dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances, in accordance with the law.

VIII. When registering, transporters shall provide the business name, the name of the manager, the nature of the organization, the location of establishment (including the location of the head office and branch offices, telegraph and telephone registration numbers), the amount of capital, the annual planned salt transportation volume, and a detailed specific plan for quarterly, monthly, and regional sales. After review and approval on a quarterly basis, if there are difficulties or other special circumstances that prevent implementation, the facts should be listed and reported to the local salt industry company for submission to the original salt industry company that approved the review.

IX. For commercial salt transported by train, the local salt industry company may assist in negotiating for vehicles based on the reported transportation figures.

X. When purchasing salt, transporters shall submit a purchase and transportation order in accordance with the local salt industry company's listed price. After approval, a payment notice will be issued, and payment shall be made to the designated People's Bank on the same day to obtain a receipt, which shall be taken directly to the Salt Administration Bureau to exchange for a salt tax certificate to collect and transport the salt.

XI. After the salt leaves the pile, the salt and the salt tax certificate shall not be separated; otherwise, it will be treated as contraband salt.

XII. When transporters report the salt volume for transport, the original salt industry company that approved the review may, according to the needs at the time, change the original planned sales location with the consent of the transporter.

XIII. If commercial salt needs to be re-transported before shipment or after reaching the destination due to special circumstances, it shall be reported to the original salt industry company that approved the review for approval, and may only be shipped after the Salt Administration Bureau has re-endorsed the tax certificate.

XIV. Upon arrival of the salt at the sales location, the transporter must report the arrival date, type, and quantity of salt to the local salt industry company and submit the tax certificate for inspection.

XV. The selling price of commercial salt shall be based on the principle of maintaining re-transportation costs and having appropriate profits, and speculation, price gouging, and adulteration are prohibited. Violations will be subject to inspection and crackdown by the China Salt Company and its affiliated institutions in conjunction with local industrial and commercial departments.

XVI. These rules apply to cooperatives and state-owned enterprises engaged in salt transportation and sales.

XVII. The management of retailers in Hankou who transport and sell more than 100 dan of salt at a time shall be handled by the salt industry company in that area in conjunction with the local industrial and commercial administration department, in accordance with the spirit of these rules, and implemented after being approved by the military and political committee of that area.

XVIII. These rules are temporarily applicable to North China, East China, and Central South China.

XIX. If there are any matters not covered in these rules, they may be submitted to the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government for reporting to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for revision and for filing with the Government Administration Council.

XX. These rules shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    五、区内与区际运商，均须向产区盐业公司申请登记。区内运商由各该产区盐业区公司核准，报中盐公司备案；区际运商须由各盐业区公司转呈中盐公司核准。
    六、运商申请登记，一经批准，各该商应迳向其所在地工商管理部门请发营业证，报由原申请登记之盐业公司验妥后，方得办理运销。

    八、运商登记时，应填报字号名称、经理姓名、组织性质、设立地点（包括总分号地点、电报、电话挂号号码）、资本数额、全年拟运盐额，并详陈分季、分月、分地运销之具体计划，经审核按季批准后，如有困难或其他特殊情形，不能执行时，应列具事实，报请当地盐业公司转呈原审核批准之盐业公司核办。
    九、商盐以火车运输者，根据其报运数字，各该地盐业公司可协助交涉车辆。

    十四、盐斤运达销地，须向当地盐业公司报告到盐日期、种类、数量，缴验税证。
    十五、商盐售价，以能维持再运成本并有适当利润为原则，不得投机、抬价、掺假。如有违犯，中盐公司及所属机构，得随时协同当地工商部门检查取缔之。
