Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: A rent reduction movement has been widely launched in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province since last month. According to statistics, in Changsha and five other special districts, one-third to one-half of the areas have carried out rent reduction struggles through reasoning and explanation of the law, and the gains obtained by farmers from rent reduction in rice alone have reached more than 260,000 shi. Many areas have also combined rent reduction with the clearing of accumulated grain that has been manipulated by local tyrants and landlords for years to exploit poor farmers. In the Yiyang Special District, more than 135,000 shi of accumulated grain were cleared out in six counties. The accumulated grain cleared out in the Fifth District of Ningxiang County is enough to sustain one-quarter of the population of the entire district for one and a half months.

At the beginning of the rent reduction movement, some farmers had certain concerns. Due to the landlords' rumors, concealment of surplus grain, and deceptive activities such as feigning poverty, some farmers believed that they might not gain anything from rent reduction. Also, some farmers, because they did not understand the question of "who feeds whom," felt that they could not break through personal feelings to reduce rent for the landlords. In order to dispel the above concerns of the farmers, farmers' representative meetings and farmers' association group meetings were held in various places to earnestly explain and discuss the rent reduction policy. At the same time, examples were used to expose the landlords' conspiracies to hide grain and evade rent reduction; furthermore, class education on "who feeds whom" was carried out by means of detailed accounting. This eliminated the farmers' concerns, enabling the rent reduction movement to unfold universally throughout the province and achieve the preliminary results mentioned above.

In the rent reduction movement, all localities used reasoning and explanation of the law, combined with requesting the government to punish the heinous local tyrants and landlords according to law, to launch struggles against the stubborn local tyrants and landlords who resisted rent reduction. Liao Renzhi, a local tyrant landlord in the Seventh District of Hengshan County, once served as the director of the "Yuebei Bandit Suppression Corps Defense Bureau" of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and murdered more than 30 revolutionary cadres including Zhou Shuping; he usually ran rampant in the countryside, oppressed farmers, and seized farmers' land, wives, and daughters. During this rent reduction, the masses of farmers accused him of his crimes, and immediately launched a struggle by reasoning, and finally handed him over to the People's Government for sentencing according to law. Yang Xiaochun, a landlord in the Eighth Bao of Yangquan Township, Ningxiang County, hid grain and stubbornly resisted rent reduction. The farmers of the bao found several large buckets of grain in the dark room of the back building of his house, each bucket containing more than 30 shi, and argued with him on the basis of reason, leaving the landlord speechless and having to return all the rent that should have been reduced on the spot.

After obtaining the fruits of rent reduction, the confidence of farmers in various places in production and overcoming the famine has been greatly enhanced, and they have invested the fruits of the struggle into production. For example, the Fourth and Fifth Bao of Jinsheng Township, Liuyang, repaired 312 reservoirs and dams after rent reduction, ensuring that the bao would not be threatened by drought throughout the year. The Second Bao of Zhongyong Township in the county spent 400 shi of grain obtained from rent reduction on fertilizer alone, and repaired 54 ponds and dams, and planted 1,000 tung trees.

### 湖南农村展开减租运动  农民得到减租果实投入生产

　　湖南农村展开减租运动
    农民得到减租果实投入生产
    【新华社长沙十六日电】湖南省广大农村自上月起普遍展开减租运动。据统计，长沙等六个专区已有三分之一到二分之一的地区进行了说理说法的减租斗争，农民得到的减租果实仅稻谷一项即达二十六万石以上。不少地区并结合减租，清理了多年来为豪绅地主操纵用以剥削贫苦农民的积谷。益阳专区六个县清出积谷十三万五千余石；宁乡县五区清理出来的积谷，足够维持全区四分之一人口一个半月的生活。
    在减租运动开始时，一部分农民曾存有若干顾虑。由于地主的造谣、隐蔽余粮、装穷等欺骗活动，有些农民认为减租可能得不到东西；也有些农民因没有弄清楚“谁养活谁”的问题，觉得打不破情面向地主减租。为着解除农民上述顾虑，各地均召开了农民代表会、农会小组会，认真进行了关于减租政策的解释和讨论，同时并以实例揭露了地主隐藏粮食，逃避减租的阴谋；进而用算细账的办法进行了“谁养活谁”的阶级教育。由此消除了农民的顾虑，使减租运动在全省普遍展开，并已获得上面所说的初步成绩。
    在减租运动中，各地都以说理说法，结合请求政府依法惩办罪大恶极的恶霸地主的方式，向顽抗减租的恶霸地主展开了斗争。衡山县七区恶霸地主廖任之曾任国民党匪帮“岳北剿共团防局”局长，杀害了革命干部周树平等三十余人；平日横行乡里，压榨农民，霸占农民田地、妻女。此次减租中，农民群众纷纷控诉他的罪行，并即展开说理斗争，最后并交由人民政府依法判罪。宁乡县洋泉乡八保地主杨晓春隐藏粮食，顽抗减租。该保农民便查出他家后楼黑屋放谷几大桶，每桶三十多石，据理以争，使该地主无言对答，只好当场如数退出应减而未减的租子。
    各地农民从减租中得到果实后，生产渡荒的信心大大提高，纷纷将斗争所得的果实投入生产。如浏阳金声乡四、五两保减租后就修好蓄水池塘和水坝三百一十二处，保证了该保全年不受旱灾威胁。该县中庸乡二保只买肥料一项就用去果实粮四百余石，修塘、坝五十四处，植桐千株。
