[Beijing News Agency Report] Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, after the promulgation of the "Notification on Handling Procedures for Labor Disputes in Private Enterprises in Beijing" on September 22nd of last year, some employers and employees in private enterprises still had unclear understanding of the contents of this notification and did not fully comply with the regulations, resulting in prolonged dispute resolution times. Therefore, Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the Labor Bureau is providing further explanations on relevant issues as follows:

    Q: After a labor dispute occurs in a private enterprise, can an application be directly submitted to the Labor Bureau for mediation without going through consultation with the industry's trade union and trade association?

    A: First, the employer and employees of the enterprise should negotiate on their own or resolve it through the labor-management consultation meeting organized by the enterprise. If it cannot be resolved, representatives from the industry's trade union and trade association should be dispatched to assist in consultation, or it should be resolved by the labor-management consultation meeting organized by the industry. If consultation still fails, then an application should be submitted to the Labor Bureau for mediation or arbitration.

    Q: If employers and employees reach an agreement through self-negotiation but do not register it with the Labor Bureau, does it have legal effect?

    A: After both parties sign an agreement, it must still be registered with the Labor Bureau, and it only has legal effect after approval by the Labor Bureau.

    Q: What content should be included in the application form for applying for mediation with the Labor Bureau? Does the Labor Bureau have a unified format?

    A: The content of the application form includes the names, addresses, factory/store names, and current business status of the applicant and the respondent, the process of dispute negotiation, the main crux of the matter, and the applicant's opinions. The Labor Bureau has a unified format for the application form, and the Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and various industry trade unions and trade associations have samples available for collection.

    Q: What will happen if a party avoids attending when the Labor Bureau summons both employers and employees for questioning?

    A: If a party is absent without reason for three times and does not entrust a fully authorized representative to attend, the Labor Bureau will conduct arbitration in absentia, using the attending party's opinion as the basis for arbitration.

    Q: In the process of negotiation, mediation, and arbitration, if the employer stops paying wages or providing meals without reason, or the employees stop production or do not comply with labor discipline, how will the Labor Bureau handle it?

    A: The case will be transferred to the court for handling.

    Q: If either party violates the mediation agreement, or after the Labor Bureau's arbitration, if either party neither executes the arbitration decision nor files an appeal with the court within the time limit, how will the Labor Bureau handle it?

    A: The case will be transferred to the court for compulsory execution.

　　京市劳动局马光斗副局长
    解答有关私营企业劳资争议处理步骤中的问题
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府劳动局于去年九月二十二日公布了《北京市私营企业劳资争议处理步骤》的通告后，有些私营企业中的劳资双方对这通告内容尚有不明了处，没有完全按照规定执行，致使争议时间拖长。为此劳动局马光斗副局长特再就有关问题分别解答如下：
    问：私营企业劳资争议发生后，不经过该行业的工会与同业公会协商，可否直接申请劳动局调解？
    答：首先应由该企业劳资双方自行协商，或由该企业组织之劳资协商会议解决之，如不能解决，应由该行业的工会及同业公会派代表帮助协商，或由该行业组成之劳资协商会议解决之，如协商仍不成立，再申请劳动局调解或仲裁。
    问：劳资双方自行协商签订协定后，不向劳动局备案，是否具有法律效力？
    答：双方签订协定后，尚须申请劳动局备案，经劳动局批准后，才具有法律效力。
    问：申请劳动局调解所填写之申请书，包括那些内容？其格式劳动局有无统一规定？
    答：申请书内容包括申请人与被申请人之姓名、住址、厂、店名称、经营现状，争议协商经过，主要症结，申请人意见等；申请书格式劳动局有统一规定，劳动局与市总工会、工商联合会、各业工会、同业公会都备有样式可以索取。
    问：劳动局传询劳资双方时，如当事人避不出席如何处理？
    答：如当事人无故三次不到，亦不委托全权代表出席者，劳动局即进行缺席仲裁，以出席一方之意见，作为仲裁依据。
    问：在协商调解仲裁过程中，如资方无故停资、停伙、或劳方停止生产，不遵守劳动纪律，劳动局将如何处理。
    答：将原案移转法院处理。
    问：如任何一方违反调解协议，或劳动局仲裁后，任何一方，既不执行仲裁决定，又不在限期以内向法院申诉，劳动局如何处理？
    答：将原案移转法院强制执行。
