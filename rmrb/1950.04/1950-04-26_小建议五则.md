　　Five Small Suggestions
            I
    We suggest that the Municipal Public Bus Company open a new route from Qianmen to Nanyuan (which can operate every other day). Because there are many soldiers and civilians traveling to and from Nanyuan every day.
                                              Lin Danhua
            II
    I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Public Bus should, as soon as possible, open a route from Jiaodaokou to Hepingmen, passing through Jiaodaokou, South Street, West Street, Ma Shi Street, Wangfu Street, Bamiancao, Dong'anmen Street, South Pool, Tiananmen, Public Security Street, Qianmen, West Jiaomin Lane, Banbi Street, to Hepingmenli. Because there are many schools and institutions along this route, and the residents along the way are also very dense.
                                                    Zhao An
            III
    On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, I saw small railway tracks left over from the Kuomintang era between Donghouheyan outside Xuanwumen and Hepingmen. I have not seen them cleaned up and used since liberation. Please ask the relevant authorities to organize them as soon as possible to avoid them becoming waste due to long-term rain and soil erosion.

            IV
    There is a room but no benches in the waiting room of Xinxiang City Station, and there is no clock, which is most needed at the station. I suggest adding them quickly.
                                                        Wu Yimin
            V
    I hope that the People's Bank can handle the business of real deposit savings on Sundays, because general workers and students only have time on Sundays.

　　小建议五则
            一
    我们建议市公共汽车公司增辟前门至南苑线路（可以隔日开车）。因为南苑每日往返军民很多。
                                              林丹华
            二
    我建议北京市公共汽车应尽先增辟自交道口至和平门的线路，途经交道口、南大街、西大街、马市大街、王府大街、八面槽、东安门大街、南池子、天安门、公安街、前门、西交民巷、半壁街，到和平门里。因为这条路线的学校机关非常多，沿途居民也很稠密。
                                                    赵安
            三
    本月十四日下午，我见到宣武门外东后河沿至和平门之间，有国民党时代遗留下来的小型铁轨，解放后未见清理使用，请有关机关从速进行整理，以免长期雨淋土蚀变为废物。
                                                        李桂森
            四
    新乡市车站候车室有室无凳，车站最需要的钟也没有。我建议赶快添置起来。
                                                        吴一民
            五
    希望人民银行在星期日办理折实存款的业务，因为一般职工、学生在星期日才有时间。
                                                        何文广
