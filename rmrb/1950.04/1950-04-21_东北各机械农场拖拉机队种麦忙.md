According to a report in the Northeast Daily: The tractor teams of the twelve state-run and provincial-run mechanical farms under the leadership of the Mechanical Farm Management Department of the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry have been mobilized and are enthusiastically engaged in spring wheat planting. It is expected that the task of sowing over 10,000 hectares of wheat will be completed by the 20th. The Ning'an Mechanical Farm started planting wheat on the 5th of this month, sowing 60 hectares that day. The Yong'an Farm had completed sowing 270 hectares of wheat by the 8th, and victoriously completed the sowing of 500 hectares of wheat by the 11th. The Chahayang and Zhaoguang farms started plowing on the 7th. The 815 Farm started harrowing on the 8th and planting wheat on the 13th. The Tongbei Farm began implementing its 1,000-hectare wheat planting task in a planned and step-by-step manner on the 12th.

Before the plowing began, each farm generally conducted production mobilization. At the mobilization meetings of the 815 Farm and the Zhaoguang Farm, a production competition was launched between tractor teams, establishing liaison contracts and a dedicated responsibility system. Individuals also engaged in mutual challenges and the writing of "letters of determination" to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks. The workers of the Zhaoguang Farm decided to complete the task of "producing 1,600 jin of wheat per hectare, 2,000 jin of soybeans per hectare, 1,520 tons of refined grains, and 1,600 tons of coarse grains."

The common characteristics of this year's mechanical farms during the sowing period are: agricultural technicians and tractor team members closely cooperated in a planned manner, carrying out large-scale sowing in a timely manner, using the new technology of combined operations (i.e., one tractor pulling several agricultural implements, whereas in the past they pulled them individually), improving the efficiency of cultivation, and beginning to implement fixed personnel, fixed quotas, and fixed quantities. Under the policy of intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, it is expected that the yield per hectare will increase by 20% compared to last year, and the sowing area of each farm will also increase by more than two times compared to last year.

　　东北各机械农场  拖拉机队种麦忙
    【本报讯】东北日报消息：东北人民政府农林部机械农场管理处所领导的十二个国营、省营机械农场，拖拉机队纷纷出动，热烈的展开春耕种麦，万余垧小麦播种任务，可望于二十日完成。宁安机械农场于本月五号开始种麦，当天即播了六十垧；永安农场至八日已播完二百七十垧小麦，至十一号胜利的完成了五百垧小麦的播种任务；查哈阳与赵光二农场于七号开犁；八一五农场于八号开耙，十三日种麦；通北农场十二日开始有计划有步骤的执行着一千垧的播麦任务。
    开犁前，各场普遍进行了生产动员，八一五农场与赵光农场在动员大会上，拖拉机队与队之间，掀起生产竞赛，订立联系合同，建立专责制；个人与个人之间，亦展开了互相挑战和立“决心书”等，保证完成今年的生产任务。赵光农场的职工决定要完成“小麦每垧产一千六百斤，大豆每垧产二千斤，生产细粮一千五百二十吨、粗粮一千六百吨”的任务。
    今年各机械农场在播种期间，共同的特点是：农业技术人员与拖拉机队员有计划的密切配合，适时的进行大面积的播种，运用连结作业的新技术（即一台拖拉机牵引数部机械农具，过去是单牵），提高了耕作的效率，并开始实行定员定额定量。在精耕细作的方针下，预计今年每垧地产量较去年增产百分之二十，而且每一个农场的播种面积也将较去年增加两倍以上。
