[News Dispatch from Beijing Municipal Government] The Beijing Municipality is about to launch BCG vaccination work. The Municipal Government's Bureau of Public Health has issued "Instructions on Local Reactions After BCG Vaccination" to alleviate the concerns and worries of parents of vaccinated children. The instructions are as follows:

　　BCG is a type of vaccine. Local reactions after vaccination are expected and normal. This is similar to the principle of smallpox vaccination. After smallpox vaccination, there is "reaction" or "no reaction." Similarly, after BCG vaccination, there will also be "reaction" or "no reaction." "Reaction" means a local reaction occurs. Under this circumstance, we can speculate that the vaccination is likely successful. If there is no reaction, then the vaccination is likely unsuccessful. Generally speaking, "no reaction" is more common in infants because the younger the age, the less likely a reaction is to occur.

　　Now, we will reiterate what we consider "reaction" in terms of local reactions. After BCG vaccination, small nodules will gradually appear at the injection (intradermal) site. Most of the small nodules will break open in about four to five weeks, draining a small amount of thin pus, leaving a small sore. This sore is different from ordinary sores. There are very few secondary infections, and no treatment is required. It can heal on its own in about eight weeks. In a very small number of children, the lymph nodes under the armpit on the side of the injection will swell. This is also harmless. These situations are all expected and harmless. We hope parents of vaccinated children will not worry. To prevent children from scratching, when a small sore develops, cover it with a small piece of sterile gauze and secure it with adhesive tape.

　　Although there is a local reaction, it can indicate that the vaccination is likely successful, but this is not entirely certain. A tuberculin test must still be performed in the eighth week to determine the effectiveness of the vaccination.

　　关于接种卡介苗后的局部反应的说明
    【京市新闻处讯】京市即展开卡介苗接种工作，市府公共卫生局顷发表“关于接种卡介苗后的局部反应说明”，以免除接种儿童家长的顾虑和担心。说明如下：
    卡介苗是一种菌苗。接种后，局部发生的反应是应该有的现象。这与种牛痘的道理是一样的。种牛痘以后有“发”与“不发”。接种卡介苗以后也同样的有“发”与“不发”的情形。所谓“发”就是局部有反应发生。在这种情形之下，我们可以推测大概此次接种是成功的。如不发则很可能接种不成功。一般说起来“不发”的情形在幼儿比较常见。因为年岁越小越不容易发生反应的。
    现在我们把认为是“发”了的局部反应情形，大致重述一下。卡介苗接种以后于接种（皮内注射）之部位渐生小硬结。大多数的小硬结于四、五星期左右破溃，流出少许稀薄的脓汁，而留下一个小的疮口。此疮口与普通疮口不同，很少有续发的传染发生，而不需要任何治疗。可以于八星期左右自己平复起来。在极少数的儿童中，在接种的那一边的腋下淋巴腺会肿胀起来。这也是无碍的。这些情形都是应该有的现象，是无害的。希望各位接种儿童的家长们不要担心。如果要防止小儿抓挠起见，在发生小疮口的时候，用一小块消毒纱布盖上，再用贴膏（橡皮膏）贴上就可以了。
    虽然局部有反应，但可以说明接种大概是成功的，但这还不够确实。仍须于第八星期行素试验，以确定接种的成效。
