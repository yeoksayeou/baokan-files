(Pingyuan Communication) Pingyuan Province is generally carrying out the work of transforming some winter schools into year-round people's schools. According to statistics from twenty-seven counties, four urban districts, and one city (materials from another twenty-nine counties, three urban districts, and one city are still lacking), 4,544 people's schools have been established, with a total enrollment of 244,184 people. This accounts for 45% of the original number of winter schools in various places, and the number of students is approximately 49% of the original number of winter school students.

The methods used in various places to convert to people's schools generally involve summarizing the achievements of winter schools level by level from the bottom up, and electing models to inspire the masses' confidence in learning based on the results of the winter schools. Therefore, the process of summarizing winter schools is the process of converting to people's schools. In areas where winter schools are doing well, people's schools are easier to maintain. For example, Wen County raised the issue of converting to people's schools at the end of the lunar year when the winter school students' enthusiasm for learning was high. On the one hand, they allowed everyone to speak freely and fully deliberate and discuss. Then, they convened a meeting of voluntary teachers to summarize the achievements of the winter schools, elect and award winter school models, and exchange experience in running schools. At the same time, they examined the shortcomings in winter schools, promoted the policy of people's schools, and eliminated the idea of "dispersing after the New Year." Then, through the village's organizational system, they mobilized students to enroll in people's schools and resolved the problems raised by the masses in their studies in a democratic manner, proposing guarantees not to interfere with production. In this way, in five or six days, 177 winter schools in the county were smoothly converted into people's schools. After summarizing the achievements of the winter school and awarding models in Yangquan Village, Hui County, 80% of the young and middle-aged people in the village transferred to people's schools. In Xinjicun Village, Tangyi, all 53 winter school students, led by party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and village cadres, transferred to people's schools and newly recruited ten young and middle-aged people to participate in the study. Xin County adopted the method of typical demonstration. For example, the leaders of Huazhuang Village seized the typical case of Huang Guichun, a member of the Communist Youth League, who recognized more than 300 characters in winter school, and publicized it to the masses, making them realize the achievements they had made and the methods to consolidate their achievements in the future, which improved the students' enthusiasm for learning. In this way, all young and middle-aged men and women in the village participated in people's schools to continue their studies.

The most important point experienced in the province's work of establishing people's schools is that after winter schools are converted into people's schools, learning organizations should be adjusted to adapt to busy farming activities. Some areas, according to the needs of the masses, freely organize learning groups by area or by production organization (women voluntarily combine according to the proximity of their residences, neighbors in front and back), and can study at any time, and can also discuss the production of their group. For example, in Beishanzhuang in Anyang, Houjiao Village in Lin County, and Nanantou Village in Xin County, the mutual aid group is the study group, and the production team leader is also the study group leader. When dividing into groups, there are also plans to assign members of the Communist Youth League, Communist Party members, village cadres, and labor models to each study group to take the lead in learning and lead production. In villages such as Jiaxiang, Guanpingchang, and Yaochang, groups are divided according to the requirements of the students: for example, merchants are divided into abacus groups, young and middle-aged people are divided into literacy groups, the elderly are divided into newspaper reading groups, and those engaged in sideline production (such as leaching nitrate) are divided into production groups, and teaching is conducted separately. Students have gained a lot and have a high enthusiasm for learning. The teaching content of people's schools should also be coordinated with the current production situation. Some areas have compiled supplementary teaching materials for this purpose. For example, the supplementary teaching material compiled by Chengji in Xin County is "The weather is warm, spring is here, hurry up and harrow the land and deliver manure." And draw pictures of "harrowing the land" and "delivering manure" on the blackboard newspaper, and write words next to them to facilitate the masses' learning and help them remember. Some people's schools combine with spring plowing to explain the common sense of sowing. For example, after Wangzhuang People's School in Wen County taught the experience of planting new-character cotton, when planting cotton, Wang Wang said: "We dare not plant foreign cotton too densely. The teacher of the People's School said that it will not produce g疙瘩 (referring to cotton bolls) if it is too dense." Nanantou People's School in Xin County combines literacy with telling "the glory of women's participation in production, and only participation in production labor can give them status," etc., to mobilize women to participate in production. Some people's schools even mobilized students to formulate personal and group production and learning plans. In this way, people's schools are consolidated and production is promoted.

At present, there are still some problems in the work of people's schools: for example, many cadres believe that "central work and people's schools contradict each other," and are only busy with central work, neglecting education, and have an unclear understanding of the purpose and great political significance of converting to people's schools. In addition, some cadres are impatient in their work and eager for quick results. They emphasize the backwardness of the masses and do not actively try to meet the production and learning requirements of the masses. In addition, some areas only make arrangements for converting to people's schools, lacking inspection. They are accustomed to holding cadre meetings and writing notices, and do not conduct in-depth research to understand the situation. Even if they are ordered to go down for inspection, they are just taking a quick look. For example, the cultural and educational assistant of the first district of Chaocheng went to Zhouhai to "urge the conversion of people's schools," and said to the village cadres: "Your village winter school is converted to people's school." After saying that, he left. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection in the future. For example, Xin County often organizes inspection teams with the district as a unit, consisting of district cultural and educational assistants, village cultural and educational committee members, and central elementary school principals, to conduct timely inspections of the elementary schools and people's schools in the district. This method can be used as a reference for various places.

### 平原省二十八个县市  二十四万人入民校学习  适应农忙活动调整学习组织

　　平原省二十八个县市
    二十四万人入民校学习
    适应农忙活动调整学习组织
    【平原通讯】平原省普遍进行将一部分冬学转为常年民校的工作。据二十七个县、四个城关区、一个市统计（另二十九个县、三个城关区、一个市材料尚缺），已建立民校四、五四四处，入学人数共二四四、一八四人。占各地原有冬学处数的百分之四五，入学人数约为原有冬学人数的百分之四十九。
    各地转民校的办法，一般是自下而上地逐级总结冬学成绩，选举模范，以冬学的成绩来启发群众学习信心。所以总结冬学过程就是转民校的过程。凡是冬学搞的好的地区，民校就容易坚持。如温县在旧历年底趁冬学学员学习情绪正高时就提出转民校的问题，一方面让大家尽情发言，充分酝酿讨论，然后召开义务教员会议，总结冬学成绩，并选举评奖冬学模范，交流办学经验。同时检查冬学中缺点，再宣传民校方针，扫除“过年散伙”的思想。然后通过村里的组织系统，动员学员入民校，并以民主方式解决群众在学习中所提出的问题，提出保证不误生产。如此五六天，全县即有一七七处冬学顺利转为民校。辉县羊圈村在总结冬学成绩，评奖模范后，全村百分之八十的青壮年转入民校学习。堂邑辛集村冬学学员五十三人在党员、团员、村干部带头下，全部转入了民校并新吸收了十个青壮年一起参加学习。莘县采用了典型示范的办法。如花庄村领导上抓住青年团员黄贵春在冬学中认了三百多字的典型事例，向群众进行宣传，使其认识到已得的成绩及今后巩固成绩的办法，提高了学员的学习情绪，这样全村男女青壮年都参加了民校继续学习。
    该省建立民校工作中所体验到的最重要的一点，是冬学转为民校后，应调整学习组织，以适应农忙活动。有的地区根据群众要求，按片、按生产组织自由拼组（妇女则按住居远近，前邻后院自愿结合），随时可以研究学习，又可以讨论本组生产。如安阳北山庄、林县后郊村、莘县南安头等村，互助组就是学习组，生产组长也是学习组长。在划分小组时，还有计划地把青年团员、共产党员、村干部和劳动模范分编到各学习小组，带头学习，领导生产。嘉祥、关平场、姚场等村，更依学员要求划组：如商贩划为珠算组，青壮年划为识字组，老年划为读报组，从事副业生产的人（如淋硝）划为生产组，分别教学。学员收获较大，学习情绪高。民校教学内容，亦应配合当前生产情况。有的地区为此自己编了补充教材。如莘县城集编的补充教材是“天气暖，立了春，赶快耙地和送粪”。并在黑板报上画上“耙地”、“送粪”的画，旁边写上字，便于群众学习，也帮助了记忆。有些民校则结合春耕，讲解播种常识。如温县王庄民校讲了种新字棉经验后，在种棉时，王旺说：“洋棉可不敢种稠了。民校老师说过，稠了不结圪疸（指棉桃）”。莘县南安头民校结合识字讲“妇女参加生产的光荣，只有参加生产劳动才有地位”等，以发动妇女参加生产。有的民校并发动学员，订出了个人的和小组的生产、学习计划。这样，既巩固了民校，又推动了生产。
    目前民校工作中还存在一些问题：如不少干部认为“中心工作与民校矛盾”，只忙于中心工作，忽视了教育，对转民校的目的和重大的政治意义认识不明确。另有一些干部不耐心作工作，急于求成。强调群众落后，不去积极想法满足群众生产和学习的要求。此外，有些地区对转民校只有布置，缺乏检查。习惯于开干部会，写通知，不深入研究，了解情况，即令下去检查，也是走马点兵，一点就过。如朝城一区文教助理员到周海“催转民校”，见了村干部就说：“你村冬学转民校罢”。说完就走。因此今后必须加强督促检查，如莘县经常以区为单位，由区文教助理员、村文教委员、中心小学校长组织检查组，及时视导本区的小学和民校工作。此一办法，可供各地参考。
