    I. Before liberation, Wang Yonglu, a pedicab driver, suffered oppression from Kuomintang bandits, secret agents, and police. After liberation, he was completely free, and everyone who took his pedicab paid him. However, the pedicab business was poor, and it was difficult to improve his life.
    II. Wang Yonglu heard the government's call for pedicab drivers to change professions and go to Chahar and Suiyuan to farm, and he became interested. He went home to discuss it with his wife, but his wife didn't want to leave Beijing. They disagreed and started arguing. Chen San, a pedicab driver in the same courtyard, signed up to participate.
    III. Wang Yonglu personally pulled his pedicab to take Chen San and his family to the station. He watched them embark on the road to production and prosperity, and he felt very envious.
    IV. The government again called on pedicab drivers to change professions, but his wife still didn't want to go. Old Wang was undecided. While he was hesitating, he received a letter from Chen San from northern Chahar saying: "The government took good care of us along the way, providing us with travel expenses and meal allowances. After arriving in northern Chahar, the local county magistrate came to welcome us, and we were allocated houses and land from fleeing landlords. Settlement allowance, food, farm tools, and seeds are all provided by the government as loans. With the help of the government and the villagers, we are gradually becoming skilled at working in the fields. We will never forget the kindness of the democratic government for the rest of our lives."
    V. After Old Wang received the letter, he discussed it with his wife, and she finally understood. They happily packed their luggage and went to the district office to sign up, wanting to go to northern Chahar to settle down, start a business, and become prosperous.

    第一文化馆分馆  崔巍
    一、三轮工人王永禄在解放前受尽国民党匪兵、特务、警察的压迫，解放后完全自由了，谁坐车都给钱了；不过三轮车生意不好，生活很难改善。
    二、王永禄听到政府号召三轮工人转业，到察绥去种地，心里就有点活。他回家与老婆商量，老婆不愿离开北京。两下意见不合，争吵起来。同院的三轮工人陈三，却报名参加了。
    三、王永禄亲自拉三轮，把陈三和他的家眷送到车站去。他看着人家走上了生产发家的大道，心中好生羡慕。
    四、政府再度号召三轮工人转业，但老婆仍不愿去。老王举棋不定。正在犹豫之间，他接到陈三由察北来信说：“一路上政府照顾周到，公家发给车费饭费。到察北后，当地的县长都来欢迎，又分得了逃亡地主的房屋和土地。安家费、吃粮、农具、种子，全由政府借给。在政府和老乡的帮助下，下地干活也渐渐熟了。真是一辈子忘不了民主政府的好处。”
    五、老王接到信以后，就与老婆商量，老婆这才想通了，两人快快乐乐地收拾行李到区公所去报名，要到察北去安家立业，生产致富。
