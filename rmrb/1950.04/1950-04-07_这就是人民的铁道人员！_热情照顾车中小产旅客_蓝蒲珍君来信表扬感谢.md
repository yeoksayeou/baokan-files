　　This is what People's Railway workers are like!
    Warmly caring for a passenger who miscarried on the train
    Mr. Lan Puzhen's letter expresses praise and gratitude to the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Railways of the People's Government:

　　On March 1st, I took the ordinary express train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Hankou back to Beijing. Due to the fatigue of the journey, I miscarried in the train at about 12 o'clock on the night of the 2nd. At that time, more than a dozen comrades on the train immediately mobilized to take care of me with great concern. They not only showed no annoyance at this accidental event, but also immediately took the necessary steps and measures. They immediately arranged for me to rest in a sleeping berth, mobilized the elderly women to take care of me, and tried to find eggs, brown sugar, porridge and other necessities for postpartum women under extremely difficult circumstances. I, who had already entered a state of coma, suddenly felt much clearer at this moment, as if the life I had lost had returned. Of course, this was because my tired body was getting rest, but the most important thing was that I was moved by this kind of caring love. I was so excited that I couldn't even calm down and rest for a while. They continued to be busy for me. And people kept asking me: "Is it serious?" "How do you feel now?" "Is there anything else you need?" Because I didn't want them to be too tired, I repeatedly said, "It's okay, I know I'm fine." But they refused to believe it and tried to call the Baoding Railway Hospital from Zhengding. After the train arrived at Baoding Station, a doctor came up, and after the doctor's diagnosis and injection, he said: "There is no danger." Everyone was relieved and let me continue north on the train. After arriving in Beijing, they didn't consider their task completed until they carried me off the train and hired a car. This attitude of being extremely responsible for the safety of passengers is absolutely impossible to find among the staff serving on the trains of old China. I am truly grateful for their care in being rescued from such a dangerous accident and being able to recover quickly. This is only possible in a society led by the Communist Party. Glory belongs to our people's leader, Chairman Mao! Now, I have fully recovered and have already started working. Please pass my message to the comrades on the train, please reassure them, and please accept the warm regards of our whole family to them! In order to commend this responsible and positive attitude in work, please give them an award, I would be infinitely grateful.

　　　　With warm regards!

　　这就是人民的铁道人员！
    热情照顾车中小产旅客   
    蓝蒲珍君来信表扬感谢人民政府铁道部负责同志：
    本人于三月一日由汉口乘京汉铁路普快车返京之时，曾因旅途劳顿而于二日晚十二时许小产于火车中。当时车上即动员了十几位同志前来殷勤照顾，他们对于这种偶发事故，非但没有表示厌烦，而且还立即采取了必要的步骤与措施。马上他们把我安置到睡卧的地方，发动了老大娘们前来料理，并且设法在极困难情形下为我找来了鸡蛋、红糖、稀饭等产妇必需之物。原已进入昏迷状态中的我，这会儿忽然觉得清醒了许多，好像是已失去的生命又回来了似的。固然这是因为疲困的身子得到了休养，但最主要的还是被这种亲切的爱护所感动。我实在太兴奋了，想平静下来休息一会都不可能。他们继续在为我忙碌着。并且不时有人问我：“要紧不要紧？”“现在觉得怎样？”“还需要什么东西不？”我为了不愿他们太劳累，就一再的说：“不要紧的，我自己知道没事。”可是他们怎么也不肯相信，又设法由正定给保定铁路医院通电话，车到保定站后，就有医生上来，经医生诊断打针后说：“没有危险。”大家才放心让我随车北行。到达北京后，一直到把我抬下火车，雇妥了汽车，他们才算交卸任务。这种对旅客安全极度负责的态度，在旧中国的火车上服务的人员中是绝对找不到的。我这次得于如此危险的事故中得救，并能迅速恢复健康，实在不能不感谢他们的照顾，这也只能在共产党领导下的社会里才有可能。光荣是属于我们的人民领袖毛主席的！现在，我已完全康复，并已开始工作。请你们把我的消息转给该车的同志们，请他们放心，并请接受我们全家对他们热烈的致敬！为了表扬这种工作中负责的积极态度，还请钧部予以嘉奖，实无限感激之至。
            此致热烈的敬礼！
