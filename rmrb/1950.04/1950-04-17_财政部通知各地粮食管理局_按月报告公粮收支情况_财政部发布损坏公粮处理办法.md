Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in order to grasp the situation of public grain revenue and expenditure, facilitate the scheduling of public grain, and ensure the task of supply, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 7 of the "Decision on Unified National Public Grain Revenue and Expenditure, Storage, and Scheduling" promulgated by the Government Administration Council, issued a notice to the grain bureaus (supply bureaus) of the major administrative regions and directly subordinate provinces (cities) regarding the establishment of a monthly reporting system for public grain revenue and expenditure by the grain bureaus (supply bureaus). The notice stipulates: Before the 6th of each month, the grain bureaus of the major administrative regions and the grain (supply) bureaus of the centrally administered provinces (cities) must telegraph the public grain revenue and expenditure situation of the previous month to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government; and before the 15th of each month, they must fill out the monthly report form for the actual revenue and expenditure of the previous month, as well as the monthly report form for grain reserves (the monthly report form for grain reserves is prepared by province, and for centrally administered provinces by district warehouse), and send them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. The notice also stipulates that when the major administrative regions and centrally administered provinces transfer grain outside the region, they should promptly telegraph a summary of the transfer situation to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government by the 15th of each month. For the above reports, it is stipulated that when the major administrative regions and centrally administered provinces (cities) compile and report to the central government, if individual grain bureaus or warehouses are unable to report in time due to transportation conditions, etc., an additional explanation may be added to the report, and the reporting time of the entire region to the central government shall not be affected as a result.
Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in order to uniformly handle public grain losses due to mildew, insect infestation, theft, fire, embezzlement, etc., has issued a notice on measures for handling damaged public grain. The notice stipulates: From now on, once any level of grain depot discovers mildew, insect infestation, fire, theft, embezzlement, etc., of public grain, it should immediately report it level by level, and should quickly prepare a detailed document reporting the amount of loss, the degree of mildew, and the cause of the loss, level by level to the provincial (municipal) people's government for handling. The notice stipulates four specific handling measures:
(1) For public grain losses of more than 20,000 catties, the provincial (municipal) people's government shall propose handling opinions and report them to the financial department of the major administrative region for handling, and the centrally administered provinces (cities) shall report them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for approval. If emergency handling is required, it may be handled first and then reported for record. Losses of less than 20,000 catties shall be handled directly by the provincial (municipal) people's government, and then reported to the financial department of the major administrative region for record, and the centrally administered provinces (cities) shall report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for record.
(2) For grain that has suffered mildew, insect infestation, fire, etc., but has not been completely destroyed, grain depots at all levels should quickly sort it out, report it to the superior for approval, and handle it in order to redeem good grain into the warehouse as much as possible.
(3) The public grain difference caused by losses should be clearly identified by subject when offsetting, and the official document number approved by the superior should be clearly indicated for verification and reimbursement. Any loss difference that has not been approved or reported level by level shall not be reimbursed.
(4) The cash obtained from the sale of bad grain approved for sale shall be immediately deposited into the local treasury for conversion into rice and credited to the account to offset the debt, and it is strictly forbidden to misappropriate it.
The notice finally requires the financial departments of the major administrative regions to instruct the grain bureaus to report the grain loss and handling situation to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government on a quarterly basis. If the loss of public grain is too large or the situation is serious, it should be reported separately at any time.
