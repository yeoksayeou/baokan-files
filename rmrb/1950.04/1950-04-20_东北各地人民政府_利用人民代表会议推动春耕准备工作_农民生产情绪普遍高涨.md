Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 18th: In the past few months, various regions of Northeast China have successively convened county, district, and village people's representative conferences or people's congresses, which have played a significant role in promoting farmers to intensify their spring plowing preparations. According to available statistics, people's representative conferences have been held in 45 counties (banners) of six provinces. Most districts and villages in these areas have also held people's representative conferences or people's congresses. These meetings, based on the specific local conditions and the problems and difficulties existing in spring plowing production, conducted serious discussions and worked out solutions.

Before the meetings, many farmers and some cadres had the following incorrect ideas about preparing for spring plowing: First, "no rush" mentality. For example, some farmers thought that it was easy to prepare because they had little land, so there was no need to rush; some thought that seeds were easy to select, so there was no need to prepare so early; some thought that it would be okay to deliver manure after the snow melted, and so on. Second, a mentality of simply relying on government assistance. For example, in Minle Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, the wheat seeds contained wild oats, and the farmers said there was nothing they could do, relying on and waiting for government loans or wheat seed grants. Third, the mistaken idea of "no need for leadership." For example, some cadres in Jixi County, Songjiang Province, believed that everyone knew about farming, and those who could work would do it themselves, and it was useless to organize lazy people. Some farmers believed that leading production was nosy. In addition, some farmers and cadres did not clearly understand agricultural production policies, especially the policies on getting organized, which also affected the progress of spring plowing preparations.

The people's representative conferences in various regions conducted in-depth discussions on the above-mentioned various incorrect ideas, and they were generally resolved. For example, the representative conference in Shengli Village, Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, corrected the "no rush" mentality of the farmers by calculating time and labor, and the farmers immediately prepared after the meeting. The representative conference in Minquan Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, studied seed selection methods, dispelling the farmers' original thoughts of not wanting to plant wheat due to poor seeds and relying solely on the government to solve the problem. Twenty villages in the seventh district of Suihua County formed spring plowing preparation committees at their people's representative conferences, and some villages also established seed selection and substitute farming committees to strengthen leadership in spring plowing preparations. The people's representative conference in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, used the example of last year's lower grain yields due to individual work to comparatively illustrate the benefits of participating in mutual aid teams. One farmer representative said, "We must organize the teams well and compete with individual households." The Nongan County People's Representative Conference introduced in detail the production mutual aid experience of Han En, a labor model in the province, making the representatives vividly feel that only by getting organized can more grain be produced. At the representative conferences in various counties, representatives from local products, grain companies, and cooperatives all stated that they would do their best to assist farmers in spring plowing. The Keshan County Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province decided to allocate seeds, prepare feed for livestock, and fertilizer for its members; the farm implement factory concentrated its efforts on manufacturing plows, harrows, and other farm implements to supply to farmers in a timely manner. In disaster areas, the people's representative conferences focused on discussing ways to combine production and disaster relief. For example, the people's representative conference in Chengde County, Rehe Province, decided to plant more early-maturing crops this year and called for planting spring vegetables in the fields planted with sorghum and corn. In addition to finding ways to allocate seeds to each other, the county government also loaned more than 300,000 jin of barley, yams, rice, and cotton seeds to help disaster-stricken people who were genuinely in difficulty to sow seeds in time.

Because the people's representative conferences in various regions earnestly solved various problems in spring plowing preparations, the production enthusiasm of the farmers was greatly improved, and they quickly implemented the resolutions of the meetings. In Qingping Village, Anguang County, Heilongjiang Province, in order to implement the resolution of the People's Congress of "men deliver manure, women select seeds," all the manure in the village was delivered within half a month. At the same time, under the promotion of female representative Liu Dushi, all the women in the village selected all the seeds in three days, and then carried out seed disinfection and germination tests. In Heping Village, Nehe County, because the representatives actively publicized the spring plowing production resolution, the whole village bought more than 30 livestock, 22 carts, and selected seeds for more than 2,000 mu of land. After the mobilization of the People's Representative Conference in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, more than 80% of the farmers participated in production mutual aid organizations. However, in some areas, the district and village cadres did not provide enough in-depth leadership in preparing for spring plowing after the People's Representative Conference was held, remaining at the level of general appeals, lacking in-depth inspection, and failing to personally take the lead in helping the masses solve specific difficulties. These phenomena have been corrected in the recent spring plowing preparation work inspections in various regions.

　　东北各地人民政府
    利用人民代表会议推动春耕准备工作
    农民生产情绪普遍高涨
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北各地过去数月间相继召开了县、区、村人民代表会议或人民代表大会，对推动农民加紧进行春耕准备工作起了很大作用。据现有材料统计：已有六个省的四十五个县（旗）召开了人民代表会议；这些地区的大部区、村也举行了人民代表会议或人民代表大会。这些会议根据当地具体情况及春耕生产中存在的问题与困难，认真地进行了讨论，并研究出解决的办法。
    各地在开会之前，有很多农民和部分干部对准备春耕工作存在着以下几点不正确的思想：第一是“不忙思想”。如有的农民认为地少好准备，不必着忙；有的认为种籽好选，不用准备这么早；有的认为化了雪再送粪也来得及等等。第二是单纯依赖政府帮助的思想。如黑龙江省克山县民乐村麦种里有油麦，农民说没法办，依赖和等待政府贷款或贷给麦种。第三是“不需要领导”的错误想法。如松江省鸡西县部分干部认为：种地的事谁都知道，能干活的自己会干，懒人组织也白搭。部分农民群众认为领导生产是多管闲事。此外，有些农民和干部对农业生产政策特别是对组织起来的政策认识不清，也影响了春耕准备工作的进行。
    各地人民代表会议，对于上述各种错误思想进行了深入的讨论，一般都得到了解决。如松江省桦川县胜利村的代表会议用算时间、算劳力的方法，纠正了农民群众的“不忙”思想，会后农民即及时准备起来。黑龙江省海伦县民权村的代表会议研究出选种的方法，打消了农民群众原来因麦种不好而不想种麦和单靠政府解决的想法。绥化县七区有二十个村的人民代表会议组成了准备春耕委员会，有的村还成立了选种和代耕委员会，以加强对春耕准备工作的领导。吉林省扶余县的人民代表会议，用去年因单独做活而少打粮食的实例，对比地说明了参加互助组的好处。一位农民代表表示：“一定要把小组组织好，和单干户竞赛。”农安县人民代表会则详细地介绍了该省劳动模范韩恩的生产互助经验，使代表们活生生地感到只有组织起来才能多打粮食。在各县代表会上，土产、粮食公司及合作社等部门的代表，都表示要尽力协助农民进行春耕。黑龙江省克山县合作社决定为社员调剂籽种、准备马料和肥料等；农具工厂则集中力量制造铧子、?耙等农具，及时供给农民应用。在灾区，人民代表会议着重地讨论了生产与救灾结合的办法。如热河省承德县人民代表会议，决定今年多种早熟作物，并号召在种高粱、玉米的地里带种春菜。除相互设法调剂种籽外，该县人民政府并贷给大麦、山药、稻子、棉籽等三十万余斤，帮助确实困难的灾民及时下种。
    由于各地人民代表会认真地解决了春耕准备工作上的各种问题，农民群众的生产情绪大大提高，迅速执行了会议的决议。黑龙江省安广县庆平村的农民，为了贯彻人民代表大会的“男送粪、女选种”的决议，全村的粪在半个月内即全部送完。同时，在妇女代表刘杜氏推动下，全村妇女在三天内就挑选完了全部种籽，接着又进行了种籽消毒和发芽试验。讷河县和平村由于代表们积极宣传春耕生产的决议，全村买进了三十余匹牲口、二十二辆车，选出二千余亩地的种籽。吉林省九台县经过人民代表会议的动员，有百分之八十以上的农民参加了生产互助组织。但也有若干地区的区村干部在人民代表会召开以后对准备春耕工作的领导还不够深入，停留在一般号召上，缺乏深入检查，没有亲自带头帮助群众解决具体困难。这些现象，在各地最近进行的春耕准备工作检查中已得到纠正。
