　　Ensuring Increased Grain and Cotton Production Closely Combined with Disaster Relief
    One Million People in Northern Jiangsu Intensively Controlling Water
    Project Completion Could Increase Agricultural Production by 30-40%

    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Yong Jin reports: Under the general principle of ensuring increased grain and cotton production, closely combining disaster relief, and using work-for-relief to overcome the spring famine, the unprecedented spring water control movement involving nearly one million people in the Northern Jiangsu region is now underway. More than 20,000 cadres (cadres above the township level) are leading 770,000 laborers distributed throughout the vast areas of the Yi River, Yangtze River, Grand Canal, coastal areas, and inland rivers (from east of the Grand Canal to the Yellow Sea), engaging in the construction of water conservancy projects. Construction commenced in all parts of Northern Jiangsu between March 5th and 15th. Among them, over 70,000 women are also actively participating in this great upsurge of water conservancy construction. Through the efforts of cadres and the broad masses, 40% of the total project has now been completed (including work from last winter).

    The total earthwork for this spring's water control project in Northern Jiangsu is approximately 68.25 million cubic meters. Most of it can be completed before the wheat harvest, with a small portion to be rushed after the wheat harvest to ensure a safe summer flood season. Upon completion of all spring projects, 5.5 million mu of grain fields and over 2 million mu of cotton fields can be freed from water disasters. It will also reduce the threat of flooding to 22 million mu of farmland along the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River, and expand cotton fields by 250,000 mu.

    In terms of water conservancy construction in Northern Jiangsu, the largest project is the Yi River diversion project. The Xin Yi River is 200 kilometers long, passing through the Shu River, Guantian, Guan River, and Wan Gong Yan River. Among them, the construction of dams and dikes on the Xiao Chao River, the repair of the Luoma Lake reservoir, and the regulation dam on the central Grand Canal are extremely arduous. The total project involves more than 38 million cubic meters of earthwork, with 350,000 laborers engaged in construction. Two million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed (including 9 million cubic meters from last winter). After the Xin Yi River dike is completed, the Shu River will flow into the sea through the Xin Yi River, and the flooded areas north of the Xin Yi River will be eradicated. Approximately 2 million mu will benefit. Luoma Lake and Huangdun Lake south of the Xin Yi River will become temporary reservoirs. After the central Grand Canal regulation dam is built, the old river flood areas in the Liutang, Sha Jiang, and Chaimi River areas can reduce water levels, facilitate the drainage of accumulated water, and benefit 1.5 million mu, totaling an increase of 350 million to 500 million jin of grain.

    The Grand Canal project in Northern Jiangsu focuses on reinforcing dikes and constructing stonework, willow mattress works, sluices, and culverts. The total earthwork is more than 3.9 million cubic meters, with over 600 meters of willow mattress and stonework, and over 20 sluices, dams, and regulation dams. In the southern section, ensure that Gaoyou Yumatou has a water level of 2.1 zhang, and in the central and southern sections, ensure that the Qingjiang Sluice has a water level of 3.1 zhang. There are currently over 110,000 laborers working on the entire Grand Canal section in Northern Jiangsu, with women accounting for one-third. To date, 500,000 cubic meters have been completed. This year, over 20 million mu of rice fields in more than ten counties along the Grand Canal, such as Funing, Gaoyou, and Taizhou, can reduce the risk of being submerged by the Huai River floods. At the same time, it also provides great convenience for navigation and irrigation.

    From east of the Grand Canal to the Yellow Sea, the main projects are dredging the shallow sections of the Xin Yang Port, cutting off excessively curved sections, selectively repairing the culverts and sluices on the Fan Gong Dike between Yancheng and Dongtai, clearing all obstacles in the inland rivers of the Li Xia River area, and continuing to dredge the Lian Dong and Binhai Tang Yu River, and the Guanyun Wutu River. The total earthwork is more than 6 million cubic meters, with more than 60,000 laborers. 3 million cubic meters have now been completed, and the entire project will be completed in just over ten days. After the completion of this project, the drainage capacity can be increased by 600 cubic meters per second, eliminating the accumulated water in the entire Lian Dong area and part of the Ning Hai area.

    The Yangtze River project in Northern Jiangsu mainly focuses on reinforcing the main dikes, mobilizing the masses to vigorously repair the branch dikes, and constructing new main dikes that are 5 gongcun higher than the highest flood level. There are 130,000 laborers engaged in dike construction on this long river dike, including over 40,000 women who are also participating in this great Yangtze River dike construction project. The total earthwork is 5.74 million cubic meters, and 2 million cubic meters have now been completed. 2 million mu of farmland along the river can be protected from the harm of typhoons. Due to the large number of water conservancy construction projects in the Northern Jiangsu area, the Yangtze River dike construction is scheduled to complete 2.27 million cubic meters after the wheat harvest.

    The coastal area of the Yellow Sea in Northern Jiangsu is a cotton reclamation area. Last winter, the old Yellow River to Sheyang Port and the Hai Dike sections of Xin Yang Port and Dou Long Port were repaired. This spring, the Hai Dike section from Dou Long Port to Wangjia Port will continue to be built, and the main drainage river channels in the reclamation areas of Taipei, Dongtai, Sheyang, and Binhai counties will be dredged. The focus of the Nantong sub-district is on repairing sea dikes and culverts. The total earthwork is 7.6 million cubic meters, with 150,000 laborers. 5 million cubic meters have now been completed (including 2 million cubic meters completed last winter). After the completion of the project, 300,000 mu of cotton fields in the Taipei, Sheyang, and Dongtai reclamation areas can be ensured to be free from flooding, and more than 249,000 mu of cotton fields will be expanded. In addition, more than 300,000 people participated in mass water conservancy construction projects throughout Northern Jiangsu, such as the construction of branch dikes and inner enclosures, with more than 30 million cubic meters of earthwork.

    The water conservancy construction projects in Northern Jiangsu are being carried out under extremely difficult conditions. Northern Jiangsu now has three major important tasks: spring plowing and planting, production and disaster relief, and water conservancy construction. Cadres and people in Northern Jiangsu are now making their best efforts to meet these three current urgent tasks and turn future work into an active endeavor. In this spring's water conservancy construction in Northern Jiangsu, various localities are closely combining it with disaster relief work. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has allocated 245.6 million jin of grain to implement work-for-relief and mobilize a large number of disaster victims to participate in dike construction. In addition to solving the food rations of millions of river workers, this grain can also enable nearly 2 million river workers' families to overcome the spring famine. Regarding the contradiction that migrant workers participating in water control cannot participate in spring plowing and production in a timely manner, various localities have adopted mutual assistance and exchange labor methods to properly resolve it. The successful construction of water conservancy in Northern Jiangsu can generally increase production by 30% to 40% in agriculture, not to mention processing and fertilization, intensive cultivation and meticulous work, and some places can increase to 50% to 60%.

　　保障粮棉增产密切结合救灾
    苏北百万人紧张治水
    工程完成后，可使农业增产三、四成。
    【本报讯】记者勇进报导：苏北区在保障粮棉增产，密切结合救灾，以工代赈渡过春荒的总方针下，近百万人参加的规模空前的春季治水运动，现正紧张进行中。有二万余干部（乡以上的干部）带领七十七万民工分布在沂河、长江、运河、沿海、内河（从运河以东到黄海边）的广大地区，从事兴修水利工程。苏北各地工程自三月五日到十五日间已全面开工。其中约有七万以上的妇女亦积极的参加了这一伟大的水利建设热潮。在干部与广大人民的努力下，现已完成了全部工程的百分之四十（去冬的在内）。
    今年苏北春季治水全部工程共约六千八百二十五万公方土，大部分可在麦收以前完成，绝小部分将在麦收后抢做，以保证安渡夏汛。全部春季工程完成后，可使五百五十万亩粮田和二百万余亩棉田免除水患，并可使运河及沿长江两岸二千二百万亩良田减除水患威胁，还可扩大棉田二十五万亩。
    苏北在兴修水利方面，其工程最大者为导沂工程。新沂河长二百公里，穿过沭河、官田、灌河、万公盐河，其中以小潮河筑坝修堤，修理骆马湖水库，中运河束水坝等工程极为艰巨。全部工程为三千八百余万公方，有三十五万民工从事修筑，现已完成土工两千万公方（内有去冬的九百万公方）。新沂河堤完成后，沭水由新沂河入海，新沂河以北泛滥地区即根除水灾，受益约有二百万亩。新沂河以南骆马湖、黄墩湖成为临时水库。中运河束水坝筑成后，六塘砂礓、柴米河一带旧河水泛滥地区可减低水位，便利积水排除，受益地一百五十万亩，总计可增产三亿五千万到五亿斤粮。
    苏北之运河工程，着重复堤及修筑石工、埽工、闸洞等，全部土工为三百九十余万公方，埽、石工六百余公尺，闸洞、堵坝、束水坝二十余座。在南段确保高邮御马头，水志为二丈一尺，中段南段确保清江大闸，水志为三丈一尺。苏北运河全段现有民工十一万余人，妇女占有三分之一，至今已完成五十万公方。今年运河沿岸阜宁、高邮、泰州等十余县两千万亩稻田可减除被淮洪淹没的危险。同时对航行灌溉亦有极大的便利。
    从运河以东到黄海边，主要工程为新洋港疏浚浅段，并裁切湾曲过甚地段，择要修理盐城东台间范公堤上涵闸，清除里下河所有内河障碍物继续开浚涟东及滨海唐豫河，灌云五图河。总计土方为六百余万公方，有民工六万余，现已完成三百万公方，再等十余天即可全部完工。此工程完成后可增加泄水量六百秒公方，消除涟东全部及泞海一部的积水。
    苏北在长江工程上主要是重点培修干堤，发动群众大力抢修支堤，新筑干堤，高出最高洪水位五公寸，在这漫长的江堤上有十三万民工从事筑堤，其中有四万余妇女也参加了这一伟大的长江筑堤工程。其总土方为五百七十四万公方，现已完成二百万公方，沿江二百万亩田地可不受风潮之害。因苏北区水利工程建设较多，长江筑堤决定在麦后完成二百二十七万公方。
    苏北沿黄海的地区，为棉垦区。于去年冬已修旧黄河至射阳港及新阳港、斗龙港两段海堤，今春续做斗龙港至王家港一段海堤，并疏浚台北、东台、射阳、滨海等县垦区的主要排水河道。南通分区重点为修海堤及涵洞，全部土方为七百六十万公方，有十五万民工，现已完成五百万公方（内有去冬完成的二百万公方）。该工程完成后，可确保台北、射阳、东台垦区三十万亩棉田不受水淹，并扩大二十四万九千余亩棉田。此外苏北全区群众性的水利建设工程，如修筑支堤内围等亦有三十余万人参加，其土方有三千余万公方。
    苏北的水利建筑工程是在极艰难的条件下进行的，现在苏北有着春耕春种，生产救灾，兴修水利三大重要任务。苏北干部与人民现正以最大的努力来迎接这三种当前的紧急任务，而使未来的工作转向主动。苏北在今年春季的水利建设中，各地并密切结合救灾工作。苏北行署所拨的二亿四千五百六十万斤粮食实行以工代赈，并动员大批灾民参加修堤。这些粮食除解决百万河工的口粮外，且可使近二百万河工家属渡过春荒。对因参加治水的民工而不能及时地参加春耕生产的矛盾，各地都采用互助换工等办法予以适当解决。苏北水利的建设成功，在农业方面不谈加工施肥、精耕细作，一般可增产三、四成，某些地方可增加到五、六成。
