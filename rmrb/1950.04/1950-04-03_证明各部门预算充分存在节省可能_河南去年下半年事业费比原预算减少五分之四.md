According to a broadcast from the Central People's Broadcasting Station: After careful calculation, the actual expenditure of operational expenses in Henan Province during the latter half of last year was more than four-fifths less than the original budget.

In September of last year, the Henan Provincial People's Government conducted an in-depth review of the operational expense budgets of all provincial-level units for the latter half of 1949. Starting from the requirement of careful calculation, they persuaded the various units, and as a result, the actual expenditure was reduced by more than four-fifths compared to the original budget figures. The original budget for operational expenses was 762.31 million catties of wheat, while the actual expenditure was only 140.85 million catties. Operational expenses are a significant item in the government's expenditure, previously accounting for almost half of the local expenditure. The flexibility of operational expense expenditure is considerable. When formulating operational expense budgets, various units often only consider their own partial interests, without considering the actual needs, priorities, and careful calculations. Instead, they fear that their own equipment is not complete and their expenses are not generous. Under the influence of this mentality, they greatly increased the financial payments that could have been reduced. The operational expense budgets submitted by various administrative departments, enterprise departments, etc., under the Henan Provincial Government last year accounted for 7% of the province's total revenue. For example, the Telecommunications Bureau, based on subjective desires, wanted to purchase a large amount of copper wire to connect telephone lines throughout the province, universally purchase telephones, and repair lines throughout the province. Therefore, the proposed operational expense budget was as high as 404 million catties of wheat. The Highway Bureau wanted to repair all major highway trunk line bridges in the province and proposed a budget of 62 million catties of wheat. Henan University, starting from the problem of resolving youth unemployment, planned to enroll 3,000 new students, build school buildings, and provide subsidized treatment for publicly funded students, so the half-year budget was also 10 million catties of wheat. The province's farms all owned good land. If calculated according to the number of staff, each person could have more than 20 mu of land, but their lives still had to be supplied by the government. Other bureaus such as the Tax Bureau and the Finance Department also proposed many budgets that were not in line with actual needs, resulting in a huge operational expense budget that exceeded the actual ability to bear. In September of last year, the main leaders of the provincial government personally took charge and, after more than 20 days of repeated review, first convened a meeting of the heads of various administrative departments and enterprises and cadres in charge of financial budgets. Starting from ideological breakthroughs, they inspired the various departments to consciously recognize the country's financial difficulties and overcome the bias of not taking care of the overall situation. Then, they conducted in-depth investigations and research to understand the work plans of various departments, conduct specific calculations, and carefully review the budget. For example, when reviewing the Telecommunications Bureau's budget, they convened a meeting of engineers, workers, material section chiefs, and general affairs section chiefs to examine the work plan based on the Telecommunications Bureau's budget of 404 million catties of wheat. The result of the calculation was that this plan could not be completed even in 1950, and the amount of wire needed was not enough even if the country's entire wire production was concentrated. Therefore, the final plan was greatly revised, and the budget was greatly reduced, from 404 million catties of wheat to 10.5 million catties. On the highway front, the plan was also revised, and it was decided to first repair the 500-kilometer lines from Xuchang to Nanyang and from Nanyang via Xinyang to Huangchuan, and postpone other repairs, reducing the budget to 8 million catties of wheat. The situation was thoroughly investigated and studied in detail for each unit. As a result, the entire operational expense budget was greatly reduced.

The spirit of careful calculation of the Henan Provincial People's Government directly educated the various provincial-level units. Therefore, the actual expenditure of operational expenses in the latter half of 1949 was less than one-fifth of the original budget of 762.31 million catties of wheat, only 140.85 million catties of wheat.

　　证明各部门预算充分存在节省可能
    河南去年下半年事业费比原预算减少五分之四
    【本报讯】据中央人民广播电台广播：河南省去年下半年度事业费实际支出经过精打细算以后比原预算节省了五分之四还多。
    河南省人民政府在去年九月间对该省省属各单位一九四九年下半年度的事业费预算，进行过一次深入的审查，从精打细算的要求出发，说服了各单位，结果实际支出比原预算数字减少了五分之四以上。原来事业费支出的预算是七亿六千二百三十一万多斤小麦，实际支出才一亿四千零八十五万多斤。该省事业费支出是政府开支中间的重要一项，过去几乎占地方支出的一半。事业费开支的伸缩性很大，各单位在制定事业费预算的时候，往往只从本身局部利益出发，不根据实际需要分别轻重缓急和精打细算，而是唯恐自身的设备不完整，开支不宽裕，在这种心理支配下，大大增加了本来可以减缩的财政支付。去年下半年河南省政府所属各行政部门、企业部门等提出的事业费预算竟占该省全部收入的百分之七。例如电信局就是按主观愿望，要大量购买铜线把全省电话线架通，全省普遍买电话机、整修全省线路，所以提出的事业费预算，竟有四亿零四百万斤小麦。公路局要修好全省各大公路干线桥梁，提出预算六千二百万斤小麦。河南大学从解决青年失业问题出发，打算广招新生三千人，要建筑校舍，和对公费生实行供给制待遇，所以半年预算也有一千万斤小麦。全省农场本来都拥有好的土地，如果按工作人员的人数计算，每人可以有土地二十多亩，但是他们的生活还要政府供给。其他如税务局、财政厅等也提出了许多不合于实际需要的预算，以致事业费预算数字庞大，超过了实际负担能力。去年九月，该省人民政府主要负责人，亲自掌握，经过二十多天的反复审核，首先召开了各行政部门，企业单位的负责人和掌管财政概算的干部会议，从打通思想着手，启发各部门自觉地认识到国家财政困难，克服不照顾全局的偏向。接着就深入调查研究，了解各部门的工作计划，进行具体计算，慎重审核预算。例如在审查电信局预算时，召集了工程师、工人、材料科长和总务科长的会议，检查根据电信局四亿零四百万斤小麦的预算的工作计划，结果计算下来，这项计划一九五零年也完成不了，所需电线数量，目前全国电线产量集中起来也不够。因此最后计划大大修改了，预算大大削减了，把预算从四亿零四百万斤小麦减到一千零五十万斤。公路方面，也把计划修改了，决定先修理许昌到南阳和南阳经信阳到潢川两线共五百公里，其他缓修，预算减到八百万斤小麦。每一个单位，都详细地调查了情况，进行深入的研究。结果就使得整个的事业费预算大大缩减了。
    河南省人民政府这种精打细算的精神，直接教育了省属各个单位。因此一九四九年下半年事业费的实际支出，还不到原预算数七亿六千二百三十一万多斤小麦的五分之一，只有一亿四千零八十五万多斤小麦。
