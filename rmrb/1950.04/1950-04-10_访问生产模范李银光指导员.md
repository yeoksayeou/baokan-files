Visiting Production Model Instructor Li Yinguang

　　By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

　　On a clear morning in March, I visited Comrade Li Yinguang, political instructor of the First Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain area of Bohai Bay. In the Changtai Farm ditch digging and levee construction, with his exemplary actions and democratic style, combining the soldiers' conscious enthusiasm for production, he launched a production competition throughout the company. Production was completed ahead of schedule, and the company won the title of model company for the entire battalion.

　　Comrade Li Yinguang is from Shouyang, Shanxi, and was born into a poor peasant family. At the age of seventeen, he joined the local guerrilla force, and in August of the same year, he honorably joined the Communist Party. In the second year of his military service, in the spring of 1942, his unit responded to the CCP Central Committee's "call" for troops to participate in production. In the guerrilla environment of Shouyang, which was fighting against the enemy, they overcame various difficulties such as many mountains and little land, and scattered land, and they engaged in land reclamation and production only five miles away from the enemy, with a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other.

　　Recalling the difficulties and cruelty of the production environment during the Anti-Japanese War, he said that compared with the current environment in which Chairman Mao instructs the troops to engage in production, it is like heaven and earth. Therefore, after Chairman Mao's instructions came down on December 5th last year, he was the first to respond to this call with great confidence.

　　In the company, when a few backward elements were discussing and resisting the production, Instructor Li held a production symposium for the entire company, addressing this thinking. He introduced in detail the situation of the guerrilla force carrying out the call of the Party Central Committee to engage in production in the cruel environment during the Anti-Japanese War. Everyone then understood that the People's Liberation Army has a long and glorious tradition of production. Soldier Ma Zhangcheng said: "The environment was so difficult in the past, and the guerrillas still engaged in production while constantly fighting. Now the environment has changed, and I will guarantee to engage in production well." The other soldiers expressed their determination to carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army.

　　In late February, the troops began to end their training. Instructor Li (secretary of the party branch in the company), in order to further conduct production education for the soldiers, first discussed it within the party branch, and ensured that the decisions and plans were implemented. He put forward "Four No's": (1) No desertion; (2) No sick people sent to the hospital (minor illnesses are not included); (3) No lazy people; (4) No violations of policies and disciplines or damage to production tools. And he put forward "Two Strives": (1) Strive to be a hero and model; (2) Strive to widely develop recreational activities. After these slogans were put forward, they were quickly handed over to the company's soldiers committee (a mass organization of representatives selected by platoons and squads) for discussion, review and implementation. After discussions in each squad, production plans were formulated, and mutual aid groups also formulated plans. Production began on March 17, and revolutionary production competitions were immediately launched between platoons and squads. Squad Nine and Squad Two successively won first place and received flowers from the division's propaganda team. The competitive enthusiasm became even higher.

　　When encountering difficulties in production, Instructor Li took the lead in overcoming them. For example, when the company was digging ditches, water overflowed after digging only one foot deep, and it was quite difficult to dig ditches in the cold water. All the soldiers in the company were dumbfounded and had no way to do it. Instructor Li took off his shoes and socks and jumped into the river first. Under his leadership, the soldiers also jumped into the water one by one, saying: "The company commander and instructor have jumped into the water, we should jump into the water even more." The soldiers have infinite respect for the instructor's persevering spirit. During breaks and games, Instructor Li was often surrounded by a group of soldiers. Every night, the instructor went deep into the squads and often held ideological free-talking meetings to solve many problems. His democratic style greatly improved the soldiers' work enthusiasm.

　　访问生产模范李银光指导员
    本报记者  康伟中
    初春三月一个清朗的上午，记者访问了驻渤海湾某地人民解放军某团一连政治指导员李银光同志。他在这次长泰农场挖渠修埝中，以自己模范的行动和民主的作风，结合起战士自觉的生产积极性，发动全连生产竞赛，生产提前完成，荣获了全营模范连的称号。
    李银光同志是山西寿阳人，出生于一个贫农的家庭里，十七岁时就参加地方游击队，同年八月他光荣地参加共产党。参军的第二年，即一九四二年的春天，他们部队就曾响应了中共中央关于部队参加生产的“号召”，在寿阳那样对敌斗争的游击环境中，克服了山多地少，土地分散等各种困难，一手拿锄一手拿枪，在距离敌人只有五里地的地方，开荒生产。
    在他回忆到抗日战争中生产环境的困难和残酷，他说和现在毛主席指示部队生产的环境相比，却是天上人间了。因之去年十二月五日毛主席指示下来后，他是抱有极大信心第一个响应这个号召的。
    在连队中，有少数落后分子都议论纷纷地抵抗着进行生产时，李指导员就针对这种思想，召开了全连生产座谈会。他将在抗日战争中残酷的环境下，游击队执行党中央号召生产的情况详细地介绍给大家。大家才明白了原来人民解放军对于生产是有着悠久的光荣传统的。战士马章成说：“过去环境那样困难，游击队在不断战斗中还搞生产，现在的环境变了，我要保证好好生产的。”其他的战士纷纷表示决心，发扬解放军优良的传统。
    二月下旬部队开始结束了练兵。李指导员（连内党支部书记）为进一步对战士进行一次生产教育，首先在党支部内讨论，并保证将决定、计划贯彻下去。提出“四无”：（一）无逃亡；（二）无送院的病号（一般小病不在内）；（三）无懒汉；（四）无犯政策纪律或损害生产工具。并提出“两争取”：（一）争取当英雄模范；（二）争取广泛地展开娱乐活动。这些口号提出后迅速交给连内士兵委员会（这是排班自派代表的群众性的组织）讨论、审查并贯彻执行。各班讨论后纷纷订出生产计划，互助小组亦订立计划。生产于三月十七开始，各排、班间随即掀起了革命的生产竞赛。九班、二班相继荣获第一，得到师宣传队的献花。竞赛热潮更形高涨。
    在生产中遇到困难，李指导员带头克服。如该连在开渠时，挖一尺深水就溢出来，天寒水冷下水挖渠是相当苦的。全连士兵都目瞪口呆的没办法。李指导员却脱下鞋、袜首先跳进河里去，战士们在他的带领下也一个个的下水了，并说：“连长、指导员都下水了，我们更应该下水。”战士们对指导员坚苦的精神是无限崇敬的。在休息中，在游戏时，指导员的周围经常团团地围着一群战士。指导员每晚都深入班内经常开思想漫谈会，解决很多问题。他的民主作风大大提高了战士们的工作积极性。
