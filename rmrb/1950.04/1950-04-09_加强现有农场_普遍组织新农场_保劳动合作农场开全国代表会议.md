Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: According to a report from the Telegraph Agency in Sofia: The National Representative Conference of Bulgarian Labor Cooperative Farms began on the 5th in the Central Trade Union Building in Sofia. Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Chervenkov, and other government leaders attended. The task of the conference is to discuss strengthening existing farms nationwide and universally organizing new farms, and to revise the cooperative farm regulations based on the experiences of representatives from various regions.

　　Chervenkov reported at the meeting that Bulgaria now has more than 1,635 cooperative farms, occupying a total of 600,000 hectares of arable land, using 6,000 tractors, and including more than 680,000 farmers, whose living standards are much higher than those of individual farmers. Bulgaria's establishment of higher and local schools to train qualified cooperative farm cadres has greatly contributed to the progress of the cooperative farm movement. Chervenkov emphasized that kulaks should not be allowed to join cooperative farms, stating that the main foundation of capitalism now is the rural kulaks, who are using all means to oppose change. Chervenkov called on small landowners and poor peasants to join cooperative farms. He said that this is the only path to happiness for Bulgarian farmers.

    【新华社八日讯】综合电通社索非亚讯：保加利亚劳动合作农场全国代表会议，五日起在索非亚中央工会大厦举行。保部长会议主席契尔文科夫及政府首长均往参加。会议的任务为讨论加强全国现有的农场和普遍组织新农场，并将根据各地代表经验的成果，来修订合作农场条例。
    契尔文科夫在会上报告称：保国现已有一千六百三十五个以上的合作农场，这些农场共占六十万公顷的可耕地，使用着六千架拖拉机，拥有六十八万以上的农民，他们的生活水平比个体农户要高得多。保加利亚开办培养合格的合作农场干部的高等学校及地方学校，已大大地有助于合作农场运动的进展。契尔文科夫强调指出：不应批准富农加入合作农场，并称：现在资本主义的主要基础是乡村富农，他们正用一切方法来反对变革。契尔文科夫要求小土地所有者与贫农参加合作农场。他说：这是保加利亚农民幸福的唯一道路。
