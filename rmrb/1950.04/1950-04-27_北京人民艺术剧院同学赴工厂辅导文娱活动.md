　　Beijing People's Art Theatre Students
    Go to Factories to Guide Recreational Activities
    [This Newspaper's News] The Beijing People's Art Theatre recently initiated the organization of students to go to factories to guide workers' recreational activities. The students going to the factories are primarily those who participated in the Winter Vacation Beijing University and Middle School Students' Art Learning Class. Under the principle of not affecting their studies, they go to the factories once a week to guide workers in singing and dancing. Currently, twenty students have successively gone to the Trade Union of the Ministry of Railways and factories in the Fifth District to carry out work. The remaining students will also go to factories in batches. If the trade unions in the Southwest City need students to guide recreational activities, they can directly contact the theatre.

　　北京人民艺术剧院同学
    赴工厂辅导文娱活动
    【本报讯】北京人民艺术剧院最近发起组织同学下工厂，辅导工人文娱工作。下厂同学以曾参加寒假京市大中学生文艺学习班的同学为基础。在不影响学习原则下，每星期下工厂一次，辅导工人唱歌和舞蹈。现已有同学二十人先后到铁道部总工会和第五区各工厂进行工作。其余同学亦将分批下厂。如西南城各工会需要同学辅导文娱工作时，可直接向该院接洽。
