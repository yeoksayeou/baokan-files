Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued instructions to broadly organize rural women to participate in spring plowing production in order to complete this year's agricultural production tasks. The full text is as follows: Democratic Women's Federations at all levels:

    In order to assist local people's governments in implementing the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production" issued by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on March 10th, and to complete the "Instructions on Agricultural Production Policy and Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plan for 1950" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on February 27th, democratic women's federations at all levels must conscientiously and extensively mobilize and organize rural women to participate in this year's agricultural production, and currently, they must first participate in spring plowing production, taking this as the central focus of leading rural women's work. Democratic women's federations in major administrative regions and provinces, in addition to leading urban women's work, must vigorously take into account leading rural women's production. County and district women's federations should take this as their most important work. Major city women's federations should also pay attention to mobilizing and organizing suburban women to participate in various possible production undertakings. In order to require democratic women's federations in various places to complete the above tasks well, the following suggestions are specifically made:

    Women in the old liberated areas have become an important labor force for restoring and developing agricultural production.

    (1) It is necessary to assist relevant government departments in publicizing and explaining this year's agricultural production policy, grain and cotton production increase plan, and instructions on spring plowing production of the Central People's Government to working cadres, active producers, labor heroes and models in rural areas, especially the vast number of male and female farmers. It should be emphasized that these are beneficial to both the country and the farmers. Only by increasing the production of grain and cotton can the country's wealth increase and the farmers' lives improve. Everyone must vigorously complete this. In addition, it is even more necessary to patiently and specifically explain to them the significant role of women in agricultural production. It must be recognized that as a result of the long-term war, the male labor force in rural areas has relatively decreased, and the female labor force has relatively increased. In some old liberated areas, the number of women has greatly exceeded that of men, and a large number have participated in agricultural production. In well-performing areas, women participating in agricultural production account for more than 50% of the total female labor force, reaching about 80% in individual places, and about 20% to 40% in poorer areas. The vast majority of these women can participate in labor such as hoeing, harvesting, and threshing, and a small number can also participate in technical labor such as seed soaking, seed selection, and plowing. Because such a large number of female laborers have been put into agricultural production, some areas have solved the difficulty of lacking male labor, and completed production tasks; some areas have expanded the cultivated area; some areas have improved the level of cultivation; and some areas have extracted male labor to engage in transportation and sideline occupations, increasing social wealth and family income. Therefore, the female labor force in the old liberated areas has become an important labor force in restoring and developing agricultural production. To complete the national grain and cotton production increase plan and restore agricultural production this year, it is necessary to fully mobilize this labor force.

    Ideological education should be patiently carried out to inspire women to consciously and voluntarily participate in production.

    (2) Democratic women's federations in various places should vigorously assist the government in mobilizing and organizing rural women to participate in agricultural production, truly achieving "50% to 70% of the female labor force in old areas with a foundation, 40% in general areas, and general advocacy in new areas." In the process of work, it is necessary to patiently and repeatedly conduct ideological education to inspire women to consciously and voluntarily participate in production, and strictly prohibit completing tasks by simple coercive methods. It is necessary to adapt to the time and place, and improve the original work foundation, so that the number of women participating in agricultural production this year will greatly increase compared with last year.

    Organize women to participate in mutual assistance, promote equal pay for equal work for men and women, and increase interest in labor exchange production.

    (3) In the old liberated areas, it is necessary to continue to adhere to the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange, and adopt various forms according to different seasons, different regions, different families, and different jobs to organize women to participate in mutual assistance labor exchange, so as to achieve unity between male and female farmers in production, improve cultivation skills, strengthen production efficiency, and complete the family's production tasks. At present, there are roughly two forms of organizing women to exchange labor and mutual assistance in various places: one is based on families, cooperation between households, with both men and women participating in the same labor exchange group. The advantage of this organizational form is that it is easy to complete the family production plan, harmonize the family, and improve women's agricultural knowledge and skills; the disadvantage is that it is easy for the male head of the family to handle everything, and even find phenomena such as the wife working and the husband earning points. Therefore, for this kind of organization, we should advocate "equal pay for equal work for men and women," "men and women in a family separately record points," and "male and female group members have equal voting rights and the right to be elected." The other is a women-only labor exchange group, which is often organized by women or young women who lack male labor. Its advantage is that it can directly solve the difficulty of labor shortage, improve women's morale, boldly do work, and strengthen labor efficiency; its disadvantage is that it is easy to be separated from the family production plan and cause conflicts with the family. Therefore, for this kind of organization, special attention should be paid to combining it with the family production plan. In addition, there is also a form of labor exchange in agricultural handicrafts, which is often a labor exchange between women who lack male labor and men who lack female labor, with men working in the fields and women helping with sewing, making shoes, and other handicraft production. The above-mentioned forms each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and can grow and develop under certain circumstances. In general, it is recommended to promote the former, but it is also impossible to force one form to organize various different women. In short, the main key to whether any organizational form can be persisted is to pay attention to discovering activists, promptly commending them, and promoting them. If difficulties are encountered, assist in solving them in a timely manner, in order to increase the enthusiasm for labor exchange production and develop the organization of labor exchange mutual assistance.

    Promote division of labor and cooperation between men and women, each doing their best, and should not regard all women as half laborers.

    (4) In order to rationally use labor, men and women should be appropriately encouraged to divide labor and cooperate, with men doing heavy work and women doing light work, cooperating to the best of their ability. At the same time, it is necessary to promote rural women to learn agricultural technology within the possible scope, encourage male farmers to patiently educate, and female farmers to humbly learn, so as to improve the level of cultivation, fertilization, and technology, implement intensive cultivation, increase fertilizer, soak seeds, select seeds, promote good varieties, eliminate pests and diseases, etc., so as to achieve the goal of increasing production in all aspects. In the process of production, attention should be paid to the special difficulties of women in physiology and family, and the health of women should be protected. For the calculation of male and female labor, remuneration should be based on the principle of equal pay for equal work, in order to stimulate labor enthusiasm and correct the view that all female labor is regarded as half labor.

    The most important thing in disaster areas now is to overcome the spring famine and carry out spring plowing.

    (5) In the democratic women's federations in disaster areas, production and disaster relief should be the only central task at present, making every effort to assist the government in mobilizing and organizing women to produce for self-rescue and economize to overcome the famine. The most important thing at present is to overcome the spring famine and carry out spring plowing. Some areas have used women to engage in sideline occupations to earn food and seeds, and men to go to the fields for spring plowing. This is a good way to overcome disasters and carry out spring plowing, and various places should promote this practice of men and women dividing labor and cooperating to produce and provide disaster relief.

    Establish and improve the view of labor as glory, and increase production knowledge.

    (6) In the process of mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production, attention must also be paid to developing women's education, enlightening women's ideological awareness, establishing and improving the view of labor as glory, increasing production knowledge, expanding and consolidating women's organizations, and consciously and gradually removing various difficulties for women in participating in production, such as assisting the government in banning foot-binding and promoting foot-loosening; such as transforming the old feudal patriarchal families and promoting democratic and harmonious new families; and appropriately implementing the principle of public and private benefits within the family according to different situations, in order to encourage women's enthusiasm to participate in production, gradually improve women's status, help women get rid of the shackles of feudal traditional customs, and protect women's special interests.

    We must conscientiously study the spring plowing instructions issued by the State Administration Council.

    (7) Mobilizing and organizing women to participate in agricultural production is an important part of the entire work of completing agricultural production tasks. Therefore, it should be suggested to people's governments at all levels that attention must also be paid to the women's production part when formulating and implementing local agricultural production plans. Democratic women's federations at or above the county level in various places must conscientiously study the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production" issued by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on March 10th, the "Agricultural Production Policy and Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plan for 1950" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on February 27th, the "Instructions on Production and Disaster Relief" issued by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government in December 1949, the "Decision on Current Rural Women's Work in Liberated Areas" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 1948, and the relevant agricultural production plans and instructions of the local people's government this year. They should discuss them in detail, combine them with the actual situation of women's production in the locality, consult with relevant parties, formulate specific plans for women's participation in agricultural production, make suggestions to local governments, check the implementation of the plan on a quarterly basis for the plans passed by local governments, summarize experiences and lessons, and report to the All-China Women's Federation on a quarterly basis.

### 全国妇联发布指示  组织妇女参加春耕

　　全国妇联发布指示  组织妇女参加春耕
    【新华社四日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为完成今年的农业生产任务广泛地组织农村妇女参加春耕生产的指示，全文如下：各级民主妇女联合会：
    为着协助各地人民政府贯彻中央人民政府政务院三月十日发布的春耕生产的指示，完成中央人民政府农业部二月二十七日发布的一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划的指示，各级民主妇联必须认真地广泛地发动和组织农村妇女参加今年的农业生产，目前首先要参加春耕生产，并以此作为领导农村妇女工作的重心。各大行政区和各省的民主妇联，除领导城市妇女工作外，必须大力兼顾领导农村妇女生产，县区妇联更应以此为最主要的工作，各大城市妇联也应注意动员和组织郊区妇女参加各种可能发展的生产事业。为着要求各地民主妇联很好地完成上述任务，特提示以下的意见：
    老解放区妇女已成为恢复与发展农业生产的重要劳动军
    （一）要协助政府有关部门，向工作干部、农村中的生产积极分子、劳动英雄模范、特别是广大男女农民，宣传解释今年中央人民政府的农业生产方针、粮棉增产计划和春耕生产的指示，应强调指出这些都是对国家对农民双方有利的事情，只有增产了粮棉，国家财富才能够增加，农民生活才能够改善，大家必须大力完成。此外，更要耐心的、具体的向她们说明妇女在农业生产中的重大作用，要使大家认识由于长期战争的结果，农村男劳动力相对地减少，女劳动力相对地增长。有些老解放区妇女的数量已大大超过男子，大批地参加了农业生产。工作好的地区，参加农业生产的妇女已占妇女全半劳动的百分之五十以上，在个别地方最高达百分之八十左右，较差的也在百分之二十到四十左右。这些妇女绝大部分均能参加锄地、收割、打场等劳动，还有少数能参加浸种、选种、耕耩等技术劳动。由于这样大批妇女劳动力投入农业生产，有些地区因此而解决男劳动力缺乏的困难，完成了生产任务；有些地区因此而扩大了耕地面积，有些地区因此而提高了耕作水平，有些地区因此而抽出男劳动力去搞运输和副业，增加了社会财富和家庭收入。所以，老解放区妇女劳动力已经成为恢复与发展农业生产中一支重要的劳动军，今年要完成全国的粮棉增产计划和恢复农业生产，就必须充分发动这一支劳动力。
    应耐心进行思想教育启发妇女自觉自愿地参加生产
    （二）各地民主妇联，应大力协助政府发动和组织农村妇女参加农业生产，真正做到“在有基础的老区应达妇女劳力的百分之五十到七十，一般地区应达百分之四十，新区应作一般提倡”。在工作过程中，必须耐心地反复地进行思想教育，启发妇女自觉自愿地参加生产，严格禁止以简单的强迫命令方法来完成任务；必须因时因地而制宜，把原有的工作基础提高一步，使今年参加农业生产的妇女比去年大大增加。
    组织妇女参加互助提倡男女同劳同分提高变工生产兴趣
    （三）在各老解放区，要继续恪守自愿和等价交换的原则，根据不同季节、不同地区、不同家庭、不同活计，采取各种不同的形式，组织妇女参加互助变工，达到男女农民团结生产，提高耕作技能，加强生产效能，完成全家的生产任务。目前，各地组织妇女变工互助的形式大体有两种：一种是以家庭为单位，户与户的合作，一家男女参加同一个变工组。这种组织形式的好处是易于完成家庭生产计划，和睦家庭，提高妇女的农业知识和技术；坏处是易于发生男子家长包办一切，甚至发现妻子劳动、丈夫挣分等现象，所以对这种组织，应提倡“男女同劳同分”、“一家男女分别记分”、“男女组员有同等发言权选举被选举权”。另一种是妇女单独组织的变工组，这种组织往往是家庭缺乏男劳力的妇女或青年妇女的组织，其好处是能直接解决劳动力的困难，提高妇女情绪，大胆做活，加强劳动效能；其坏处是易与家庭生产计划脱节，易与家庭发生矛盾，因此对于这种组织，要特别注意与家庭生产计划结合。此外，尚有农业手工业变工的方式，往往是缺乏男劳动力的妇女与缺乏女劳动力的男子变工，男子下地生产，妇女帮助缝衣、做鞋等手工业生产等。上述几种形式各有其优点和缺点，都能在一定情况之下生长和发展。一般情况以提倡前者为主，但也不可勉强用一种形式来组织各种不同妇女。总之，无论采用任何一种组织形式，而使其坚持下去的主要关键是在注意发现积极分子，及时表扬，加以推广，如遇困难，及时协助解决，以提高变工生产的积极性，发展变工互助的组织。
    提倡男女分工合作各尽所能不应把妇女都看作半劳动力
    （四）为着合理使用劳动力，应适当地提倡男女分工合作，男子做重活，妇女做轻活，通力合作，各尽所能。同时必须在可能范围内提倡农村妇女学习农业技术，鼓励男农民耐心教育，女农民虚心学习，以便提高耕锄、施肥与技术水平，实行精耕细作，增加肥料、浸种、选种、推广优良品种、除去病虫害等，从各方面达到增产目的。在生产过程中要注意妇女生理上和家庭里的特殊困难，保护妇女健康。对于男女劳动力的计算，应根据同工同酬的原则，按劳得酬，以刺激劳动积极性，纠正把妇女劳动力一律当作半劳动力的看法。
    灾区当前最重要的是渡过春荒进行春耕
    （五）在灾区的民主妇联，应以生产救灾为当前唯一的中心工作，尽一切努力协助政府动员和组织妇女生产自救，节约渡荒，当前最重要的是渡过春荒，进行春耕。有些地区曾经由妇女搞副业挣口粮种籽，男子下地春耕，既渡过了灾荒，又进行了春耕的好办法，各地应推行这种男女分工合作，协力生产救灾的作法。
    树立和提高劳动光荣的观点增加生产知识
    （六）在动员和组织妇女参加生产的过程中，必须同时注意开展妇女教育，启发妇女的思想觉悟，树立和提高劳动光荣的观点，增加生产知识，扩大并巩固妇女的组织，有意识地逐步地解除妇女参加生产中的各种困难，如协助政府禁止缠足，提倡放足；如改造封建家长制的旧家庭，提倡民主和睦的新家庭；根据不同情况，适当地实行家庭内部的公私两利原则等等，以便鼓励妇女参加生产的积极性，逐渐提高妇女的地位，帮助妇女解除封建传统习俗的束缚，保护妇女的特殊利益。
    必须认真学习政务院发布的春耕指示
    （七）发动和组织妇女参加农业生产，是完成农业生产任务的全部工作中的一个重要组成部分，故应向各级人民政府建议，在制订和贯彻当地农业生产的计划时，必须同时注意妇女生产部分。各地县级及县以上的民主妇联必须认真学习中央人民政府政务院三月十日发布的春耕指示、中央人民政府农业部二月二十七日发布的一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划、一九四九年十二月中央人民政府政务院发布的生产救灾指示、一九四八年十二月中共中央发布目前解放区农村妇女工作决定以及今年当地人民政府有关农业生产的计划和指示，并详加讨论，结合当地妇女生产实际情况，与有关各方协商拟订妇女参加农业生产的具体计划，向各地政府提出建议，并就各地政府通过的计划，按季检查计划执行程度，总结经验教训，并按季向全国妇联汇报。
                                    （中华全国民主妇女联合会）
