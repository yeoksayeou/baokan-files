　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Bureau] Most of the industrial and mining enterprises under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry have completed or exceeded their production plans for the first quarter of 1950 (January, February, and March), but significant achievements in reducing costs and improving quality have not yet been widely achieved. Democratic management and production systems are also not yet sound enough. Those exceeding the first quarter's plan include: the six coal mines under the Jingxi Coal Mining Company, which produced 115,053 tons of coal, exceeding the original plan by 8.4 percent; the two newly built flour mills, which produced 128,269 bags of flour, exceeding the original plan by 12.2 percent; the Yanjing Paper Mill, which produced over 30,110 reams of paper, exceeding the original plan by 1.1 percent; the newly built glass factory, whose output exceeded the original plan by 8.4 percent; and the Danhua Match Factory, whose output exceeded the original plan by 3.2 percent. Other factories, such as the newly built lime kiln factory, pharmaceutical factory, and iron factory, failed to complete their plans due to reorganization or undeveloped sales channels. Among the three public utilities, the tram company and the water company performed best. The tram company planned to build 7.5 new locomotives but produced 11.11, and the total number of new locomotives, overhauled locomotives, and trailers exceeded the plan by 10.9 percent. After one route was converted into a loop, the number of passengers and revenue increased. The water company expanded its pipelines by 11,863.3 meters, exceeding the plan by 7.1 percent, and the overhaul of machinery and adjustment of lines were completed on schedule. The overall plan for the bus company was not completed, but the average number of passengers per vehicle kilometer increased from 19.2 to 20.19, and the task of driving kilometers also exceeded the plan by 0.2 percent. Regarding improving quality and reducing costs, most units still need to work hard to improve, except for a few that have already made gains. The central link lies in whether they rely on workers and implement democratic management. Among the six coal mines under the Jingxi Coal Mining Company, the Chengzi Coal Mine, because it consults with workers on everything and solves problems in a timely manner, has increased productivity and reduced costs by 23 percent. The tram company mobilized workers to launch rationalization proposals, resulting in improved work efficiency. In three months, it saved labor, coal, electricity, and administrative expenses, totaling 262,327 catties of millet. Therefore, the company's costs were greatly reduced, reversing the original loss-making state and achieving a surplus. Conversely, the public bus company did not pay attention to relying on workers and did not value many of the workers' reform opinions, resulting in continued losses. For example, the newly built glass factory had serious defects, but the leadership was still busy all day long, not relying on workers to eliminate defects, resulting in an average defect rate of 47.6 percent in three months. Most of the units that have already established factory management committees have become mere formalities. In addition, various necessary production systems are not yet sound. Workers in the newly built glass factory produce in excess of quotas, but there are no records or rewards. Cost accounting is generally inaccurate in all factories. Factories also do not pay enough attention to product sales, failing to make capital turnover flexible. For example, the Danhua Match Factory, the Yanjing Paper Mill, and the No. 2 newly built iron factory have accumulated large quantities of products that cannot be sold. They must abandon the past idea of only caring about production and not worrying about sales, and vigorously expand sales channels.

### 京市公营工矿企业  大部完成第一季生产计划  尚需贯彻民主管理提高质量减低成本

　　京市公营工矿企业
　　大部完成第一季生产计划
　　尚需贯彻民主管理提高质量减低成本
    【京市新闻处讯】京市工业局所属工矿企业绝大部分完成或超过一九五○年第一季（一、二、三月）生产计划，但降低成本、提高质量尚未普遍获有显著成绩。在民主管理和生产制度方面也还不够健全。超过今年第一季计划的有：京西煤矿公司所属六煤矿，共产煤十一万五千零五十三吨，超过原计划百分之八点四；两个新建面粉厂共产面粉十二万八千二百六十九袋，超过原计划百分之十二点二；燕京造纸厂产纸三万零一百一十余令，超过原计划百分之一点一；新建玻璃厂产量超过原计划百分之八点四，丹华火柴厂产量超过原计划百分之三点二。其他如新建石灰窑厂、制药厂、铁工厂等由于改组或销路尚未打开等原因，未完成计划。在三个公用事业中，电车公司和自来水公司成绩最好，电车公司计划做新机车七点五辆，结果做了十一点一一辆，加上大修机车、拖车的数字共超过计划百分之十点九，一部车路改为环行后，乘客人数增加，收入增多；自来水公司扩充管线一万一千八百六十三点三米，超过计划百分之七点一，检修机器、调整线路工作都如期完成。汽车公司总计划未完成，但平均每车公里人数由十九点二增加到二十点一九，同时行车公里的任务也超过了百分之零点二。对于提高质量、降低成本，除少数单位已有收获外，大部还需努力改进，中心环节就在于是否依靠工人，实行民主管理。京西煤矿公司所属六个煤矿中，城子煤矿由于遇事和工人商量，有问题及时解决，因之生产率提高，成本降低达百分之二十三。电车公司发动工人，展开合理化建议，结果工作效率提高，三个月里节省人工、煤、电、事务费，共折小米二十六万二千三百二十七斤，因此，该公司成本大大降低，扭转了原来赔累状态，且获有盈余。相反的，公共汽车公司不注意依靠工人，对工人许多改革意见未予重视，致仍然赔本。又如新建玻璃厂废品现象严重，而领导上仍终日忙忙碌碌，不依靠工人消灭废品，以致废品率三个月平均达百分之四十七点六。各单位已经成立工厂管理委员会的，大都流于形式。此外，各项必要的生产制度还不健全，新建玻璃厂工人生产超额，不纪录也不奖励。成本计算各厂普遍的都不精确。对于成品推销，各厂也不够重视，不能使资金周转灵活，如丹华火柴厂、燕京造纸厂、新建铁工厂第二厂等堆积大批产品销不出去，须抛弃过去仅顾生产不愁推销的思想，大力开扩销路。
