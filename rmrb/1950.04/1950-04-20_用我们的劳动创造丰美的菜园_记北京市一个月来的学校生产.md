　　Creating Abundant Vegetable Gardens Through Our Labor
    ——A Record of School Production in Beijing Over the Past Month
    Wu Yingji
    Three thousand five hundred seventy-eight students and staff from thirteen universities and seventy-two secondary schools in Beijing have launched heroic production labor on more than 1,620 mu of land in the city and nearby suburbs. Students at the China University of Technology worked all day during the spring break to level mounds of earth and increase arable land. Students at North China Middle School were covered in sweat as they tilled the land, but refused to rest. In one month of production labor, students not only began to learn agricultural techniques such as plowing, making ridges, watering, applying fertilizer, and sowing seeds, but some also learned to build houses, construct toilets, and repair wells. To facilitate the use of water from ponds and marshes for irrigation, students at the China University of Technology built two cable cars using the terrain.
    
    Production Labor Must Have Discipline
    At the beginning of the production labor, a few students participated with a playful attitude, and production discipline in the fields was very abnormal. These shortcomings occurred in eight schools, including Sino-French University, Pingmin Middle School, Shengxin Co-educational Middle School, Yuying Middle School, and Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Xin Sheng No. 1 Academy, Lida, and Muzhen at the Temple of Heaven Farm. Some students at Fu Jen Catholic University even wrestled on the leveled ground, and the leader of the Xin Zhi Middle School went to sleep on the side, causing chaos, and some splashed cold water on the mules pulling the water carts, driving the mules around to make fun. Now, after farmers made suggestions, school administrations paid attention, and student unions carried out propaganda and mobilization, these phenomena have basically been overcome. At the same time, some people who previously thought production was too difficult and did not participate are now changing their minds and signing up; and those who were not in good health and thought production was too easy and participated reluctantly are now resting peacefully under the persuasion of their classmates. Many school teachers voluntarily participate in production, especially middle school homeroom teachers, most of whom work in the fields with their students. Under the careful cultivation of students, teachers, and workers, most of the land has now been sown.
    
    With the help of the People's Government in providing land and loans, coupled with the enthusiastic labor of the vast number of students, school production has created a very good situation. Judging from the current situation, the key to the success or failure of production lies in whether the production committees of each school can master the production plan, pay attention to technology, cultivate deeply and meticulously, apply more fertilizer, water frequently, and be good at organizing labor, accurately calculating work points, and rationally distributing the fruits of labor.
    
    Careful Calculation, Good Planning
    To cultivate a good vegetable garden, careful calculation is essential. For example, after making a detailed calculation of the investment, North China Middle School found that the largest item in the expenditure was fertilizer. After the production committee mobilized students and workers to collect manure, carry black mud, and buy two manure carts to solve the fertilizer problem for the summer and autumn seasons, the fertilizer expenditure was reduced by more than half. They have guaranteed that they will earn at least 23,000 jin of millet this year on the eleven mu of land on campus and the more than fourteen mu of land in the western suburbs. After formulating a production plan, Boys' No. 1 Middle School also guaranteed that it would earn at least 6,000 jin of millet on 24 mu of land. However, some schools, because they did not formulate accurate production plans, lacked confidence, fearing losses if they invested too much, and fearing the trouble of planting vegetables, so they adopted a perfunctory approach, cutting corners and planting field crops. They mistakenly believed: "This can save labor and expenses."
    
    Hire Technicians, Learn Technology
    To correctly grasp the production plan, it is necessary to pay attention to technology first, and to hire experienced and responsible technicians. Hebei High School hired a good technician who helped the school's production committee formulate a production plan based on the actual situation, ensuring that there would be vegetables to eat at any time. He also enthusiastically helped the workers and students of the school and other schools to study cultivation methods. However, the technicians hired by Seventh Middle School and Chengda Middle School, etc., did not know how to grow vegetables at all, so there was no question of guidance. On land without the guidance of technicians, the soil was mostly turned too shallow, the ridges were not suitable, and the land was uneven and could not be watered. At the Temple of Heaven Farm, students only pulled the stems and leaves or pulled the weeds up by the roots without picking them up and taking them outside the ground, and they grew back in a few days, which wasted a lot of labor.
    
    Organize Labor, Prevent Waste
    In terms of organizing labor, first, there must be a plan to prevent waste of manpower and overcome the phenomenon of delaying study and failing to produce; second, attention should be paid to enlightening students to consciously discuss and abide by labor discipline. In the first few days of production at the Temple of Heaven Farm, there was no plan to organize labor, and students from eight schools flocked there one after another, with several times more people watching than working. Yuying Middle School started without a plan, with about 150 people from three shifts stopping classes a day, while actual production only needed 50 people. The method of exchanging labor has not been applied widely enough, especially at the Temple of Heaven Farm, where there are too few people exchanging labor, and many regular jobs are not done. The schools that have already exchanged labor are roughly divided into two categories: one is fixed exchange labor, and the other is temporary exchange labor. Fixed exchange labor means that workers live in the fields for a long time, while temporary exchange labor involves workers taking turns working in the fields, or exchanging labor according to different work needs, such as when a house needs to be built, students exchange labor with workers who can build houses. These methods can be widely and flexibly adopted by various schools.
    
    Consciously Abide by Production Covenants
    Poor labor discipline not only hinders production work and lowers students' morale, but also easily causes resentment from farmers and technicians. Now, North China Middle School, Boys' No. 1 Middle School, and other schools have formulated production covenants and farm schedules, and students can consciously abide by them, overcoming past shortcomings. In the past, students at Boys' No. 1 Middle School also trampled on farmers' wheat fields, defecated indiscriminately, and did not cherish farm tools, which were criticized by the farmers. After they implemented the covenant, their relationship with the farmers improved. Old Wang, the technician of the school, was unwilling to guide the students and make suggestions in the past, but after the students implemented the covenant of "absolutely obeying Old Wang's guidance," Old Wang greatly发挥了 the enthusiasm of his work. Schools where labor discipline is still very bad should immediately assist the school administration, mobilize students to consciously formulate and abide by labor discipline. We resolutely oppose the method of coercion and command, such as the provision in the production covenant of Yuying Middle School that people who sign up to participate in production are not allowed to withdraw, Lida Middle School counting those who sign up to participate but do not go as truancy, Third Middle School once forced boarding students to participate in production, and Hongda Middle School wanted to include labor as an item in the evaluation of moral conduct. These methods are inappropriate.
    
    Pay According to Work, Fair Distribution
    The issue of distributing the fruits of labor should be noted. Because each school has not yet recognized the importance of the principle of "fair and reasonable, pay according to work," it has neglected the calculation of work points. For example, Xihua Girls' Middle School does not record work points at all, and Muzhen's recording of work points is also very careless. The two collective farms at the Temple of Heaven and Liuhe Village in the southern suburbs should pay special attention to this, otherwise the unreasonable distribution of fruits will hinder students' enthusiasm for production.
    
    The eleven schools in the fourth group and the eight schools in the fifth group have organized two collective farms respectively, elected farm directors, and unified management. North China, Peide, Pingmin in Enjisi in the western suburbs, Hebei High School in Tongjiafen, Provincial Teachers College, Eighth Middle School, and Yuying, Faqin, Fifty-third, Chongde, etc., also organized mutual aid groups because their land is connected, and jointly discussed ways to take turns using wells, buy livestock, hire technicians, and adjust the use of farm tools. Through mutual cooperation, they have solved many difficulties that a single school cannot solve.

　　用我们的劳动创造丰美的菜园
    ——记北京市一个月来的学校生产
    吴英济
    北京市十三个大学和七十二个中等学校的三五、七九八位同学和员工，已经在城内和近郊的一千六百二十多亩土地上展开了英雄般的生产劳动。华大工学院同学为了平土堆增加耕地面积，利用春假整日劳动。华北中学同学在刨地的时候，汗流浃背，仍不肯休息。在一个月的生产劳动中，同学不但开始接触到了刨地、打畦、浇水、上粪、下种等农业技术，有的还学盖房子、搭厕所、修水井等工作。华大工学院同学为了便于利用池沼里的水浇地，就利用地形搭了两个滑车。
    劳动生产要有纪律
    生产劳动开始时，有少数同学是抱着游戏的态度来参加的，在地里打打闹闹生产纪律很不正常。中法大学、平民中学、盛新男女中、育英中学及天坛农场的女一中、新生一院、立达、慕贞等八校，都曾发生过这些缺点。辅仁大学有的同学还在平好的地上摔跤，新知中学带队的跑到一边去睡觉，自己乱闹，有的拿凉水泼拉水车的骡子，赶着骡子乱跑取笑。到现在，这些现象经过农民的提意见、学校行政的重视和学生会的宣传动员，基本上已经克服了。同时，过去把生产看得太难而不参加的，现在也有人转变想法而报名参加了；身体不好而把生产看得太容易勉强参加的，也在同学的规劝下安心休养了。很多学校的老师自愿地参加生产，特别是中学的班主任，大部分都和同学一道下地劳作。在同学、老师和工友的精心耕作下，现在大部分土地已经播种。
    在人民政府给地、贷款的帮助下，加上广大同学积极生产的劳动热情，学校生产已经开创了很好的局面。就目前情形看，生产成功或失败的关键，在于各校生产委员会能否掌握生产计划、重视技术、深耕细作、多上粪、勤浇水，和善于组织劳动力、精确计工、合理分配果实等。
    精打细算  订好计划
    菜园种好，必须精打细算。如华北中学在对投资作了精细计算之后，发现了开支中最大的一项是肥料，经生产委员会动员同学和工友掏粪、抬黑泥，并买了两辆粪车，自己解决夏、秋两季粪肥后，肥料开支即节省了一半以上。他们已保证今年在校内十一亩和西郊十四亩多的土地上，最少能赚二万三千斤小米。男一中订了生产计划之后，也保证在二十四亩地上最少能赚六千斤小米。可是，有些学校因为没有订精确的生产计划，就没有信心，投资多了怕赔钱，种菜怕费事，于是就采取应付差事的办法，偷工减料，种大庄稼。他们错误地认为：“这样可以省工又省经费”。
    聘请技工  学习技术
    要作到正确地掌握生产计划，首先要重视技术，要聘请有经验肯负责的技工。河北高中请了一个好技工，他根据实际情况帮助该校生产委员会订了生产计划，保证随时都有菜吃，他并热心地帮助本校和外校的工友、同学钻研耕作方法。而七中、成达等校请的技工，根本不会种菜，当然就谈不到指导了。在没有技工指导的土地上，大部分情形是土翻得太浅，畦做得不合用，地高低不平不能浇水。天坛农场的地，同学们拔草只拔了茎叶或连根拔了而没有捡到地外边，过了几天又长出来了，这就浪费了不少劳力。
    组织劳力  防止浪费
    在组织劳动力方面，首先要有计划，防止浪费人力，克服既耽误学习又不能生产的现象；其次要注意启发同学自觉地议定与遵守劳动纪律。天坛农场开始生产的头几天，没有组织劳动力的计划，八校同学络绎不绝地涌去，看的人比劳动的人多好几倍。育英中学开始没有计划，一天三班约一百五十人停课，而实际生产只需要五十人。变工办法应用得还不够普遍，尤其是天坛农场，变工人员太少，很多经常工作没人做。在已经变工的各校大致分为两类：一类是固定的变工，一类是临时的变工。固定变工是工友长期住在地里，临时变工又有工友们轮流下地，或看工作需要不同而变工，如需要盖房子时，同学就和能盖房子的工友变工。这些办法各校可以广泛地灵活地采用。
    自觉遵守生产公约
    劳动纪律不好不但妨碍生产工作、降低同学情绪，还极易引起农民和技工的反感。现在华北中学、一中等校都订了生产公约和农场作息时间表，同学们都能自觉地遵守，克服了过去的缺点。一中同学过去也有践踏农民麦田、随地便溺和不爱护农具的情形，受到了农民的批评。当他们实行了公约以后，和农民的关系就搞好了。该校技工老王，过去不肯指导同学和提意见，而在同学实行了“绝对服从老王的指导”的公约以后，老王大大地发挥了工作的积极性。至今劳动纪律还很坏的学校，学生会应该即时协助学校行政，动员同学自觉地订立并遵守劳动纪律。我们坚决反对强迫命令的办法，如育英中学的生产公约中规定报名参加生产的人不许退出，立达中学对报名参加而不去的人算旷课，三中曾经强迫住宿生参加生产，弘达中学要将劳动作为评操行分数的一项，这些办法都是不妥当的。
    按劳取酬  公平分配
    分果实的问题应该注意了。各校因为还没有认识到“公平合理，按劳取酬”这一原则的重要性，而忽视了计工，如协化女中根本没有记工，慕贞记工也很马虎。天坛和南郊六合庄的两个集体农场应该特别注意这一点，不然果实分配得不合理将会妨碍同学生产的积极性。
    第四组的十一个学校和第五组的八个学校分别组织了两个集体农场，选出场长，统一经营。西郊恩济寺的华北、培德、平民、佟家坟的河北高中、省师、八中及育英、法勤、五三、崇德等校，由于土地相接，也都分别组织了互助组，共同商量轮用水井、买牲口、请技工、调剂使用农具等办法。通过互相合作解决了很多单独一校所不能解决的困难。
