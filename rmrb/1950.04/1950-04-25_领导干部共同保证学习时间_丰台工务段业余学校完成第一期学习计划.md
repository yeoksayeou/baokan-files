　　Leading Cadres Jointly Ensure Study Time
    Fengtai Works Section Amateur School Completes First Phase of Study Plan

    [Our Newspaper] The workers' amateur school of the Fengtai Works Section of the Tianjin Railway has completed its first semester (three months) of study. According to the results of the final exam, it is estimated that after three months of formal amateur study, one-quarter of the students have improved to the equivalent of one year of elementary school; one-half of the students have improved by half a year, and the rest have also made progress. Forty percent of all students averaged above 80 points, and only ten percent failed. Among the 45 students in the intermediate class, only five could write letters at the beginning of the semester; now, 30 can write coherent letters and diaries. The learning achievements of this period are equivalent to twice the achievements of the past seven or eight months of scattered learning. The school opened on January 4th this year, with a total of 113 students (accounting for two-thirds of the total number of employees in the Fengtai area of the Works Section). They are divided into elementary and intermediate classes, with ten hours of study per week. Cultural courses account for three-fifths of the teaching content, and technical and political courses each account for one-fifth. During the study period, the normal progress of learning was guaranteed due to the close cooperation and full support of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. They stipulated that 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every evening is the workers' study time, and no one is allowed to infringe upon it. The Party, the Trade Union, and the League do not hold meetings or carry out any activities during this time; the administration does not give any tasks to disrupt the study. Throughout the entire semester, except for a ten-day holiday for the Spring Festival, there was only one day off due to a comprehensive crash task. The students also encouraged each other not to miss classes, and the groups ensured full attendance. The workers in the first work area had to walk fifteen li back and forth from their residences to the school, but they were rarely late. The Party and the League also organized Party members and League members to make study plans and take the lead in studying. The administration and the trade union solved the difficulties in the study for the school. All the rooms of the trade union were used as classrooms, and even the desk of the director of the trade union was handed over to them. Because everyone valued the amateur school, it became a large family of the Works Section, bringing vigorous vitality. The section chief said: "In the past, I was afraid that the school would affect production. I didn't expect that after studying, everyone's production enthusiasm was even higher. Everyone's culture and technology have improved. It has also increased business efficiency and work efficiency. The administration has benefited greatly, both directly and indirectly." Some workers who had been demoted and had their salaries reduced have rekindled their enthusiasm for work because of the study. Among them, Wang De Bu became a first-class model.

　　领导干部共同保证学习时间
    丰台工务段业余学校完成第一期学习计划
    【本报讯】天津铁路丰台工务段的职工业余学校，已完成了第一学期（三个月）的学习。据期终测验的成绩估计，三个月的正规业余学习，有四分之一的学员提高了相当于小学一年的程度；二分之一的学员则提高了半年程度，其余的也有进步。全体学员平均成绩在八十分以上的占百分之四十，不及格的仅百分之十。中级班学员四十五人，初开学时仅有五个人能写信；现在，已有三十个人能写通顺的信件和日记了。这一时期的学习成绩，相当于过去七、八个月散漫学习的成绩的两倍。该校于今年一月四日开学，学员共一百十三人（占工务段丰台地区职工总数的三分之二）。分编初级、中级两班，每周学习十小时。教学内容文化课占五分之三，技术课与政治课各占五分之一。学习中，由于中共支部、行政、工会与青年团的密切配合和全力支持，保证了学习的正常进行。他们规定每天晚上七时至九时是工人的学习时间，谁也不许侵犯。党、工会、团都不在这个时间内开会或作任何活动；行政方面也不给任何任务来打乱学习。整整一学期中，除了春节放了十天假外，只有一次是因全面性的突击任务而放了一天假。学员们也彼此勉励不误课，小组保证全体出席。第一工区的工人住处离学校来回要走十五里，然而他们很少迟到。党和团并组织党员、团员订学习计划，带头学习。行政和工会给学校解决学习中的困难。工会的全部房子都做了课堂，连工会主任办公的桌子都交给他们用了。由于大家都重视业余学校，它成了工务段的大家庭，带来了蓬蓬勃勃的生气。段长说：“从前我恐怕学校影响生产，没想到学习之后大家的生产情绪更高了。大家的文化和技术提高了。也增进了业务效能和工作效率。行政方面直接间接都得到了很大的实惠。”有一些曾被降职、减薪的工人，因为学习又鼓起了工作热情。其中的王德不?竟成了一等模范。
