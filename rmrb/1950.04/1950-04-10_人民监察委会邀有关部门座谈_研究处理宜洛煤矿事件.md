　　People's Supervisory Committee Invites Relevant Departments to Symposium
    Research on Handling of Yiluo Coal Mine Incident
    [Xinhua News Agency] After the gas explosion at the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council dispatched personnel to investigate. Based on the investigation results, the committee has proposed disciplinary actions against the parties involved. For the sake of prudence, the People's Supervisory Committee convened a symposium on the 8th with the heads of relevant departments to solicit opinions on the handling of the Yiluo Coal Mine incident. In addition to the director, members, secretary-general, and directors of the committee, the attendees included Lan Gongwu, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Mao Qihua, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labor, and the heads of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry. At the meeting, Deputy Procurator-General Lan, Deputy Minister Mao, and others spoke successively, unanimously agreeing with the disciplinary opinions proposed by the Supervisory Committee for the parties involved. They unanimously believed that the main reason for the Yiluo Coal Mine explosion was the extremely serious bureaucratic style of the mine's leadership in not paying attention to safety equipment and not caring about the safety of workers' lives. To learn from this painful lesson, it was generally agreed at the meeting that enterprise departments across the country should conduct general inspections, and that joint inspection committees should be organized by the relevant departments to regularly inspect various locations to thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic work styles.

　　人民监察委会邀有关部门座谈
    研究处理宜洛煤矿事件
    【新华社讯】河南宜洛煤矿发生瓦斯爆炸事件后，中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会即派员前往调查，现已根据调查结果，提出对当事人的处分意见。人民监察委员会为慎重起见，特于八日召集有关部门负责人座谈，征询对宜洛煤矿事件处理意见。出席座谈的除该委员会主任、委员、秘书长、厅长外，尚有最高人民检察署副检察长蓝公武、劳动部毛齐华副部长和中央财经委员会、全国总工会、燃料工业部等机关负责人。会上、蓝副检察长、毛副部长等先后发言，一致同意监委对当事人所提处分意见，并一致认为此次宜洛煤矿爆炸事件的主要原因是该矿领导上不重视安全设备、不注意工人生命安全的极端严重的官僚主义作风所造成。为接受这次沉痛的教训，会上大家认为，全国各地企业部门应普遍进行检查，并由各有关部门共同组织检查委员会，经常分赴各地检查，以彻底肃清官僚主义作风。
