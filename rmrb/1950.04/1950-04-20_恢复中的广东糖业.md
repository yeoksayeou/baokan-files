　　Recovering Guangdong Sugar Industry
    Our Special Correspondent Xiao Hang
    (I)
    Guangdong's sugar production ranks second only to Taiwan and first among all provinces on the Chinese mainland. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese mainland had seventeen modern sugar factories, eight of which were in Guangdong, mostly operated by bureaucratic capitalists. As for Guangdong's private sugar factories and traditional sugar mills, there were about seven thousand, large and small; some of them even had simple machinery. According to the "Sugar Industry Yearbook," in the heyday of the sugar industry (1935-36), the province's annual output reached 182,980 tons. Therefore, restoring Guangdong's sugar industry is of great significance for supplying national needs, increasing people's income, and enriching tax revenues. Therefore, the central government's industrial investment in Guangdong this year focuses on the sugar industry.
    Originally, before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, China was one of the world's five major sugarcane-producing countries along with Cuba, India, Java, and the Philippines, exporting a certain amount of sugarcane sugar every year. Taking 1873 (the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign) as an example, the amount exported to the United Kingdom alone reached more than 2,000 tons. However, after the Sino-Japanese War, with the loss of Taiwan, our country changed from an exporter to an importer. According to the "Sugar Industry Yearbook" statistics at the end of 1941, from 1934 to 1939, the annual import of foreign sugar was about 400,000 tons. This is a very large foreign exchange figure. Guangdong Province, known for its sugar production, also saw the total value of foreign sugar imports reach a staggering 18 million silver dollars in 1937 due to the dumping of foreign sugar. Now that we have explicitly banned the import of foreign sugar and Taiwan has not yet been liberated, the supply of sugar throughout the country must first rely on the recovery of Guangdong's sugar industry.
    The recovery of Guangdong's sugar industry will bring a huge fortune to the people of the entire province. According to a survey by the Nanlu Special District Tax Bureau, Xuwen County on the Leizhou Peninsula almost universally boils sugar, just as northern farmers pickle salted vegetables; it is a major side occupation. However, due to the ravages of the Kuomintang, production has greatly decreased. The income from sugarcane is also very meager. However, last year after the liberation of Guangdong, the price of every hundred dan of sugarcane was raised to twelve to thirteen dan of rice, which was a phenomenon that had never occurred during the Kuomintang rule. It is believed that with the support of the People's Government in the future, the income of sugarcane farmers will surely continue to increase.
    Guangdong's sugar production is very abundant and has always been one of the main sources of tax revenue, and it remains so today. According to a report by the Provincial People's Government Tax Bureau, sugar tax accounts for 50 percent of the total commodity tax this year. If the province's sugar industry can be further restored, it will greatly increase the country's fiscal revenue.
    Precisely for these reasons, after the liberation of Guangdong, the People's Government devoted itself to the restoration of the sugar industry, and on December 26, 1949, a Sugar Industry Administration was specially established under the Provincial Department of Industry to promote this work.
    (II)
    At the beginning of its establishment, the Sugar Industry Administration determined that restoring the production of state-owned sugar factories would be its main focus.
    Among the weak industrial base of Guangdong, the state-owned sugar factories have relatively good machinery and equipment. For example, the machinery of the Dongguan and Shunde factories are all products of the Czech Skoda factory. These sugar factories were established after 1928. At that time, Chen Jitang wanted to use the favorable domestic and international conditions to build his own small kingdom in Guangdong. So he rampantly plundered and opened factories, and sugar factories like the Shitou Sugar Factory were established one after another. After that, Guangdong's sugar industry had considerable development. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders bombed sugar factories such as Jieyang. When the Kuomintang took over, they mismanaged them, and the factories were completely unrecognizable. After the liberation of Guangdong, we took over seven sugar factories including Dongguan, Shunde, Jieyang, Huiyang, Shitou, Limin, and Yuwotou, and another sugarcane improvement factory. Most of these factories were dilapidated and unable to start work. The Sugar Industry Administration, based on the conditions at the time, decided to first restore the production of the Dongguan and Shunde factories.
    The first step in the restoration work was to repair the machinery. Due to the Kuomintang's past practice of only using the machinery without maintenance, many of the factory's machines were damaged. Relying on the efforts of all employees, overcoming numerous material and technical difficulties, the two factories resumed operation in November and December of last year, respectively. And the sugarcane crushing volume quickly exceeded the pre-liberation level. Before liberation, the highest sugarcane crushing volume of the Shunde factory was 816 tons per day. Although the Dongguan factory had reached 1,009 tons, it was still inferior compared to the current record. According to statistics, the average daily sugarcane crushing volume of the Shunde factory is 1,095 tons, and the Dongguan factory is 1,076 tons. As of March 28, the two factories had crushed more than 160,000 tons of sugarcane, producing 15,520 tons of sugar. The two factories have also achieved certain results in saving raw materials. Before liberation, the total loss rate of each dan of raw materials was 26 percent, now it is 23 percent. The achievement of these gratifying results is certainly due to the strengthening of leadership and the establishment of bonus systems, but the main reason is that after the elimination of labor traitors and the anti-corruption campaign, the labor enthusiasm of all employees has been unprecedentedly improved, as well as the close cooperation between technicians and workers. As a technician in the repair department said, in the past, everyone was not enthusiastic about working, especially when it was about to stop work (sugar cane crushing is seasonal, and work stops every summer and autumn), everyone adopted a "don't care" attitude. Now, everyone regards work as their own family affairs and takes it seriously. In the past, workers did not care about technical improvements, because even if there were some suggestions for improvement, they would not be supported by the technicians, let alone the factory. At that time, the technicians' conservative thinking was very strong, and they all wanted to "keep a secret." Now the situation has changed drastically, and everyone has begun to cooperate fully. For example, at the beginning of the operation of the Shunde factory last year, the average daily sugarcane crushing volume was less than 600 tons. On December 28, after joint research by technicians and workers, the machinery was repaired. As a result, the sugarcane crushing volume on the 29th suddenly increased to 975 tons, on the 30th it increased to 1,066 tons, and on the 31st there was a slight drop, but since then the daily average has been above 1,000 tons. In the past, the price of the Five Rams brand white sugar produced by the factory was always one to one and a half Hong Kong dollars lower than the price of the Pomegranate Flower brand produced by the Dongguan factory. Now, due to the improvement of quality, the price is completely equal to that of the Pomegranate Flower brand. And the latest products have reached the standard for beverage sugar.
    (III)
    From the situation of the Dongguan and Shunde factories, the recovery of the production of state-owned sugar factories is very fast. Therefore, under the current conditions of very difficult finances, the central government still extracts a part of the funds and invests it in the sugar industry in Guangdong. The Sugar Industry Administration also has a plan to further increase production, striving to complete the task of producing 40,000 tons of sugar this year. To this end, in addition to continuing to improve the work of the Dongguan and Shunde factories, it also plans to repair the Shitou Sugar Factory. The biggest difficulty currently encountered is the poor source of sugarcane.
    Originally, Guangdong has a large area that can be planted with sugarcane. According to a survey by the Japan Sugar Industry Federation, it is about 9 million to 10 million mu. The area that has been planted with sugarcane, including 250,000 mu in Hainan Island, has also reached 1.25 million mu. In addition, Guangdong has better natural conditions, and the sugarcane growing period only takes 10 months (it takes 16 to 18 months in Taiwan and Cuba, and 20 months in Honolulu), and the sugarcane supply was originally not a problem. However, in recent years, it has been devastated by the enemy, sugar prices have fallen, most sugarcane farmers have gone bankrupt, production interest has sharply reduced, and the sugarcane planting area has been greatly reduced; and the sugarcane varieties have gradually deteriorated, because the sugarcane varieties should be replaced every three years, but now, they have not been replaced for five or six years; even many sugarcanes are not fertilized at all. So the yield has plummeted. In the past, the average annual yield of each mu of sugarcane field was 140 dan, but last year it was only 20 dan to 60 dan. If this situation is not changed, it will not only affect the sugar industry this year, but also because we have not signed a contract with the sugarcane farmers, the production plans of the Dongguan and Shunde factories last year have not been fully completed due to the difficulty of raw materials. Therefore, the Sugar Industry Administration plans to do its best to help sugarcane farmers improve varieties, increase fertilizer application, and guide them to improve farming techniques this year to ensure the supply of raw materials and thereby smoothly complete this year's production tasks.
    (IV)
    Finally, there is an important issue that needs to be raised, and that is the specific methods for dealing with the traditional sugar industry.
    The traditional sugar industry has backward technology, and its waste of raw materials is very large. Originally, one dan of sugarcane could squeeze ten jin of white granulated sugar, or even more, while the traditional sugar mills can only squeeze six jin. If the machine sugar industry is developed, the traditional sugar industry would have no need to exist. However, at present, there are limited machine sugar factories in Guangdong, and even fewer in other provinces on the mainland. And mainly due to the low purchasing power of the people, the consumption of sugar in the whole country (except Taiwan) is only 700,000 to 800,000 tons per year, which is a very small number compared with the 5 million to 6 million tons consumed by countries such as India and the 2 million tons consumed by countries such as the Soviet Union, making it the country with the smallest consumption among more than 50 countries in the world; but even this small consumption cannot be self-sufficient since the loss of Taiwan, and 400,000 tons of foreign sugar are imported every year. Now that we have explicitly banned the import of foreign sugar, the domestic sugar production must be appropriately increased in order to supply the needs of the whole country, and this task is definitely beyond the capacity of the existing machine sugar factories. Therefore, in Guangdong, a set of leadership and management methods should be determined for the considerable number of traditional sugar mills and private sugar factories with some machinery and equipment, so as to improve technology and improve quality. In this regard, the Kuomintang once adopted wrong policies. In order to monopolize the sugar industry, they stipulated that those with capital of less than 50,000 yuan were not allowed to register. As a result, the sales of sugarcane became a big problem, and the area of sugarcane fields was reduced accordingly, to the extent that even the Kuomintang's own sugar factories felt the lack of raw materials. Today, what we are facing is not this kind of problem, but the lack of specific leadership and management of the traditional sugar industry and private sugar factories. As a result, they take the opportunity to evade taxes and, under the conditions of sugarcane source difficulties, use some bad methods to compete with state-owned sugar factories for raw materials. If this continues, it will be very unfavorable to the recovery of Guangdong's sugar industry and will have a significant impact on the country's tax revenue. Of course, since Guangdong was liberated relatively late, some work has not yet been brought into the right track, and the occurrence of these phenomena in the past has its own reasons; however, now that this issue has been placed before us, it is better to solve it as soon as possible.

　　恢复中的广东糖业
    本报特派记者  萧航
    （一）
    广东的硝糖产量，仅次于台湾，而居于我国大陆各省的首位。抗战前，中国大陆有新式制糖厂十七所，广东即拥有八所；多为官僚资本所经营。至于广东的私营糖厂以及土法榨糖场，大小约有七千多家；其中的一部分并有简单的机器设备。根据“糖业年鉴”的调查，在糖业兴盛的年代（一九三五——三六），全省年产量达到十八万二千九百八十吨。因此，恢复广东的糖业，对于供应全国需要，增加人民收入，充裕税源有很大作用。所以中央在今年内对广东的工业投资，重点就摆在了糖业上面。
    本来，在一八九四年甲午战争之前，中国与古巴、印度、爪哇、菲律宾同为世界五大蔗糖国家，每年有一定数量的蔗糖输出。就以一八七三年（清同治十一年）来说，仅输往英伦一地的，即达二千多吨。但自甲午战争以后，台湾沦丧，我国便由输出国一变而为输入国。据一九四一年底“糖业年鉴”统计，从一九三四到三九年，每年输入的外糖全在四十万吨左右。这是一个很大的外汇数字。而向以产糖闻名的广东省，也由于外糖的倾销，一九三七年的外糖输入总值，竟达到一千八百万银元之巨。现在，我们已明令禁止外糖入口，而台湾尚未解放，全国砂糖的供给，不能不首先依靠于广东糖业的恢复。
    广东糖业的恢复，将给全省人民带来一笔巨大的财富。据南路专区税务分局调查，雷州半岛上的徐闻县，几乎家家熬糖，如同北方农家腌咸菜一样普遍，是一项主要的副业。不过由于国民党的摧残，产量大减。蔗的收入也很寥寥。但是，广东解放后的去年，每百担甘蔗的价格已提到十二担到十三担大米，这是在国民党统治期间不曾有过的现象。相信今后在人民政府的扶植下，蔗农的收入一定会继续增加。
    广东的糖产十分丰饶，历来就是主要的税源之一，直到今天还是如此。据省人民政府税务局报告，今年糖税占货物税总额的百分之五十。如果全省的糖业能够得到进一步的恢复，那将会更大地增加国家的财政收入。
    正是为了这些原故，广东解放之后，人民政府即致力于糖业的恢复工作，一九四九年十二月二十六日在省工业厅下专设糖业管理局，负责推动这一工作的进行。
    （二）
    糖业管理局成立之初，即确定以恢复公营糖厂的生产，作为自己的工作重点。
    广东的公营糖厂，在基础薄弱的全省工业中，机器设备是比较好的。例如东莞、顺德等厂的机器，全是捷克斯可达厂的出品。这些糖厂建立于一九二八年之后，当时，陈济棠想利用于他有利的国内外条件，在广东搞他自己的小小王国，于是大肆搜刮，开办工厂，市头等糖厂乃次第建立起来。此后广东的糖业有了相当的发展。抗战爆发后，日寇炸毁了揭阳等糖厂，及至国民党接收过来，又经营不力，各厂已面目全非。广东解放后，我们接管了东莞、顺德、揭阳、惠阳、市头、利民、鱼窝头等七座糖厂，另有甘蔗改良厂一处。这些工厂多半破破烂烂，没法开工。糖业管理局乃依据当时条件，确定首先恢复东莞、顺德两厂的生产。
    恢复工作的第一步是检修机器。由于过去国民党光使用、不保养，各厂机器已损坏不少。依靠全体职工的努力，克服了重重的器材与技术困难，两厂遂于去年十一、十二两月先后开工。并且榨蔗量迅速超越了解放前的水平。解放前，顺德厂的最高榨蔗量是每天八百一十六吨，东莞厂虽曾达到过一千零零九吨，但与现在的纪录比较，依然是逊色的。据统计，顺德厂的每日平均榨蔗量是一千零九十五吨，东莞厂是一千零七十六吨。截至三月二十八日止，两厂已榨蔗十六万余吨，出糖一万五千五百二十吨。在节省原料方面，两厂也获得一定成就。解放前每担原料的总损失率是百分之二十六，现在是百分之二十三。这些可喜的成绩之获得，固然得助于领导的加强，以及超额奖金等制度的建立，而主要原因，则是全体职工在清除了工贼，进行了反贪污之后，劳动热忱空前提高，以及技师与工人的密切合作。正如修理部的一位技工所说的，过去大家做工总是不起劲，尤其是快要停工的时候（榨糖有季节性，每年夏秋停工），大家就采取“不管它”的态度。现在，大家把工作看成像自己家里的事情一样，认真去做。过去，工人并不关心技术的改进，因为即使有些改进意见，也不为技师所支持，更不用说厂方了。那时，技师的保守思想很重，都想“留一手”。现在情形大变，大家开始做到了通力合作。例如顺德厂去年开工之初，每日平均榨蔗量不足六百吨。十二月二十八日，经过技师和工人的共同研究，检修了机器，于是，二十九日的榨蔗量即突增至九百七十五吨，三十日增至一千零六十六吨，三十一日曾有回落，此后每日平均全在千吨以上。该厂过去所产五羊牌白糖，与东莞厂榴花牌的相较，每担价格始终低一元至一元五角港币。现在由于质量提高，已与榴花牌的价格完全相等。并且最新的出品，已达到饮料用糖的标准。
    （三）
    从东莞、顺德两厂的情况来看，公营糖厂生产的恢复是很快的。因此，在今年财政十分困难的条件下，中央仍抽出一部分资金，投入广东的糖业。糖业管理局也有进一步提高生产的计划，争取今年完成产糖四万吨的任务。为此除继续改进东莞、顺德两厂的工作外，并拟修复市头糖厂。现在所遇到的较大困难，是甘蔗来源不畅。
    本来，广东可以植蔗的面积很大，据日本糖业联合会调查，约有九百万到一千万亩。曾经植蔗的面积，包括海南岛的二十五万亩在内，也达到了一百二十五万亩。加以广东自然条件较好，甘蔗生长期只需十个月（在台湾、古巴需十六至十八个月，檀香山则需二十个月），甘蔗供给原不成问题。但是近年以来，横遭敌人摧残，糖价下落，蔗农多半破产，生产兴趣锐减，种蔗面积遂大大缩小；而且甘蔗的品种也逐渐变坏，因为本来应该三年换一次蔗种的，现在，五六年还不换一次；甚至许多蔗根本不上肥料。所以产量一落千丈。过去每亩蔗田的常年产量是一百四十担，去年则仅有二十担到六十担。这种情况如不改变，不仅会影响今年的糖业，而且由于我们没有和蔗农把合同订好，东莞、顺德两厂去年的生产计划，就已经因为原料困难而没有全部完成。因此，糖业管理局今年计划尽力帮助蔗农改良品种，增施肥料，并指导他们提高耕作技术，以保证原料供应，并借此来顺利完成今年的生产任务。
    （四）
    最后，有一个重要问题，需要提出来，这就是对待土糖业的具体办法问题。
    土糖业技术落后，其对原料的浪费是很大的。本来一担甘蔗可榨十斤白糠，甚或更多些，而土糖场只能榨到六斤。如果机器糖业发达，土糖业原无存在的必要。可是目前广东的机器糖厂有限，大陆的其他省份则更是寥寥。而主要由于人民购买能力太低的原故，全国（台湾除外）食糖的消耗量每年仅七、八十万吨，与印度等国每年消耗五、六百万吨，苏联等国消耗二百万吨比较，为数很小，成为世界五十多个国家中消耗量最小的国家；但即使这个不大的消耗量，自台湾沦丧之后，也还不能自给，每年输入外糖达四十万吨左右。现在我们既已明令禁止外糖入口，那么国内的砂糖产量必须适当提高，才好供应全国需要，而这一任务，又决非现有的机器糖厂所能胜任。因此，在广东，应该对于为数颇多的土糖场以及有些机器设备的私营糖厂确定一套领导与管理的办法，使之改进技术，提高质量。在这一方面，过去国民党曾采取过错误的政策，他们为了垄断糖业，规定凡资本在五万元以下的不准登记。这一来，甘蔗的销路大成问题，蔗田面积随之缩小，以至使国民党自己的糖厂也感到了原料的缺乏。今天我们所碰到的倒不是这类问题，而是对土糖业以及私营糖厂没有加以具体领导与管理。其结果是他们乘机偷税漏税，并在甘蔗来源困难的条件下，用些不好的办法，和公营糖厂争夺原料。这样下去，对于广东糖业的恢复是很不利的，对于国家的税收也颇有影响。当然，由于广东解放较迟，若干工作还没有纳入正轨，过去这些现象的发生，有它一定的原因；但是，现在这一问题已经摆在我们面前了，还是早一点解决才好。
