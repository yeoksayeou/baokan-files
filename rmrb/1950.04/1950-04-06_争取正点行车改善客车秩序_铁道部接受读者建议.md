To the Editor:

We have read the letter from Comrade Zhang Yindou, a reader, published in the People's Forum on March 18th, and we believe the suggestions made are very valuable. We also consider the poor conditions of passenger trains on the Beijing-Taiyuan and Datong-Puzhou lines, as pointed out in the letter, to be a serious fact that needs immediate improvement. Therefore, in addition to accepting them, we specifically reply as follows:

(1) Regarding train delays, one aspect is due to the poor condition of locomotives. Under the current difficult conditions, although locomotives are maintained for use, they often cannot achieve the prescribed travel speed during use, which affects on-time train operation. Another aspect is poor management, with insufficient personnel organization and allocation. Some employees are sometimes negligent in handling their duties, which often causes train delays.

(2) The poor order on passenger trains is mainly due to insufficient transportation capacity. The number of train trips is limited, while there are many passengers, often exceeding the passenger capacity of the trains. As a result, the cars are crowded. In particular, the South Datong-Puzhou line is a narrow-gauge railway, and general passenger cars cannot cross the track. The original narrow-gauge passenger cars are not sufficient, so棚车 (covered wagons) have to be used temporarily instead. Insufficient attention is paid to cleanliness and hygiene inside the carriages, and the equipment conditions are very poor, creating opportunities for individual passengers to ride without buying tickets.

(3) Regarding the insufficient variety of food suitable for the general public in dining cars, those who operate dining cars often emphasize that dining car equipment is limited, and improvements are very slow.

(4) Regarding the issue of the ticket sales time being too short at Yuci Station, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau has been instructed to order the station to sell tickets as early as possible in the future.

The Ministry of Railways believes that, regarding the above points, although there have been some objective limitations in the past, many problems have also been caused by insufficient human effort and negligence of duty by individual employees. In addition to the Ministry of Railways paying attention to leadership in the future and instructing relevant railway bureaus to study improvements, measures for rectifying passenger train services are being formulated. Starting from April 1st, key work will be implemented nationwide, focusing on revising passenger train schedules, fully utilizing train transportation capacity, striving for on-time operation, improving cleanliness and hygiene inside the cars, improving passenger order, and ensuring that dining car operations provide meals that are as suitable for the general public as possible, in order to meet the needs of passengers.

### 争取正点行车改善客车秩序  铁道部接受读者建议

　　争取正点行车  改善客车秩序
    铁道部接受读者建议编辑同志：
    三月十八日人民园地所载读者张印斗同志来函阅悉，我们认为所提意见非常宝贵。信中所指京太、同蒲两路客车不良情形，我们也认为是一个严重的立待改进的事实。因此，除愿接受外，特答复如后：
    （一）关于火车误点，一方面是由于机车不良，在目前困难条件下，机车虽维持使用，但在使用途中往往不能达到规定的行驶速度，影响正点行车；另一方面是管理不良，人员组织配备不够周密，部分员工在办理业务上时有疏忽，因此时常造成列车误点现象。
    （二）客车秩序不良，主要是由于运输能力不足。列车次数有限，而旅客人多，往往超过客车定员人数。因之车内拥挤。特别南同蒲线是窄轨，一般客车不能过轨，而原有窄轨客车又不敷应用，只能暂且以棚车代用，车内清洁卫生照顾不够，设备条件很差，遂造成个别旅客不买票乘车的机会。
    （三）关于餐车食品不够大众化，经营餐车者多强调餐车设备受到限制，而改良很慢。
    （四）榆次站售票时间太短问题，已令太原路局转饬该站，今后尽量提前时间售票。
    对于以上各点铁道部认为过去虽然在客观条件上受到某些限制；但由于人为努力不够，以及个别员工疏忽职责所造成的也很多。除铁道部今后在领导上注意及责令有关路局研究改善外，并制定整顿客运列车办法。自四月一日起，在全国实行重点工作，即在于改定旅客车点，充分利用列车运输能力，争取正点运行，改善车内清洁卫生，旅客秩序及餐车经营使膳食尽量大众化，以满足旅客的要求。
