　　Our Direction
(Passed by the April 1950 Work Discussion Conference of the China Vocational Education Society and approved by the Third Standing Council)

We, a group of education workers, staff members of the China Vocational Education Society and its affiliated units, held our first National Work Discussion Conference in Beijing from April 5th to 11th with great excitement after liberation. We made frank and in-depth reports and reviews of the Society's past work, and then defined the Society's future work line, position, principles, tasks, and system.

Line

First of all, is the issue of line. It has been exactly thirty-three years since the establishment of the Society. Thirty-three years ago, it was precisely the time when Chinese people were seeking "truth" from Western capitalism. Economically, World War I gave Chinese industry and commerce a temporary opportunity to rise. Chinese people's general ideas about the country and the economic situation required education to change its appearance, from graduates' knowledge not being applicable and having no way out, to enabling students to acquire skills for making a living and adapting to the needs of national industry and commerce cadres. The establishment of the Society and the proposal of vocational education were reflections of the social development of China at that time. Judging from the situation at the time, this represented the progressive side of the reformist line. The real problem, due to the stubborn existence of imperialism and feudalism, was naturally not solved by changes in education.

Due to the consistent oppression and deception of the reactionary rulers in the past, the Society, in a certain period, held a supra-political attitude, only engaged in education, and avoided close relations with actual politics. This supra-political attitude produced two consequences: one was that the Society was able to survive and preserve itself in an extremely harsh environment, and the other was that the Society failed to proactively accept the leadership of the revolution early and reduced the greater role it could have played.

The reformist and supra-political attitude, starting from the September 18th Incident, experienced the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, has been corrected by facts, replaced by a step-by-step approach to the revolutionary forces. The thirty-three-year journey has been a journey from reformism and a supra-political attitude to a one-sided leaning towards the people's revolutionary camp. In this journey, we are very ashamed that the Society has been moving very slowly, and also very tired and bitter, but after many twists and turns, we have never retreated. Today, the Society has consciously and actively recognized the line of the people's democratic revolution, and is determined to work hard on the education front to complete its historical mission.

Position

Secondly, is the issue of position. The basic difference between reform and revolution, supra-politics and one-sided leaning towards the people, lies in the different class positions. In the past, China's vocational education, from its essence, belonged to the category of capitalist education, so its basic position could not but be the position of the bourgeoisie. The so-called reformism and the so-called supra-political attitude are precisely the reflection of the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie consciousness. Although the Society initially put forward slogans such as "preparing for increased production for China and the world" and "making the unemployed employed and the employed happy in their work," standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, it was impossible to fully realize these slogans. Now, Chinese society has entered the stage of new democracy, and the Society must stand on the position of the working people, connect with the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, actively assume historical mission, and wholeheartedly serve the working class in order to promote the construction of a new democratic country.

Principles

Thirdly, is the issue of principles. The Society is an education work group responsible by private individuals. In the past, whether in business, personnel, or work style, the Society indeed had its own set of things to distinguish it from the then reactionary government. Because the Society's work generally conformed to the interests of the people, while the reactionary government only knew how to serve the interests of a very small number of people, the Society was "private" in appearance but "public" in essence, which was in sharp contrast to the reactionary government's "public" in appearance but "private" in essence. The past principle was correct, what should be private was private, and the boundary with the reactionary government was clear. The current environment is completely different from before. The government is the people's government, and the education it wants to promote is an education that is more closely and perfectly connected with the interests of the people than we have imagined. In this case, our principle should be "turning private into public, combining public and private." The Society is truly very fortunate to be able to contribute the private undertakings that it has cultivated for many years to our own government in a step-by-step manner. Doing so will only expand the Society's influence and last for a long time. However, "turning private into public" does not mean that the Society has nothing to do. On the contrary, after establishing such a principle, we found that the Society still shoulders a considerable task; it is not that after one night, we can completely ignore what we are doing. This is not a responsible attitude towards the people. We must do all kinds of undertakings better, so as to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of work and steadily realize the above-mentioned principle. First of all, we must grasp the national policies, so that the Society's business can be coordinated with the government's entire plan. Strengthen the existing work, move forward steadily, and thoroughly implement "turning private into public, combining public and private" under the premise that it is possible and more in line with the interests of the people, so that all the Society's work becomes an integral part of the national education system.

Tasks

Fourthly, is the issue of tasks. In order to consolidate the leadership of the working class, and to welcome the upcoming upsurge of economic construction, the government is now paying attention to the promotion of technical education and the advocacy of spare-time education. These two types of education happen to be the areas in which the Society has been actively engaged for many years and has achieved some results. From this point of view, it can also be said that the Society's business has naturally cooperated with the government's plan. What we need to work hard on is how to strengthen our work on the original basis. Among technical education and spare-time education, we should focus more on the latter, because the improvement of workers' cultural and professional level not only helps to improve technology, but also is an effective way to create a new type of intellectuals. We must study and improve the experience of running technical education and spare-time education for many years, and assist the government in completing the current very urgent task of cultivating technical talents and improving workers' cultural and professional level.

System

Finally, is the issue of the system. The Society is an education work organization and also a mass organization. Due to the above-mentioned limitations of ourselves, coupled with the oppression of the reactionary rulers, although the Society has considerable mass influence, it does not have a broad mass base. This has prevented the Society's organization from implementing the principle of democratic centralism. Today, in the new environment, we must adopt the method of "from the masses, to the masses," open the door of the Society to the broad masses of workers, and become a society that mainly serves the workers, and is also run by the workers. On this basis, we will definitely be able to establish a sound and effective democratic centralism, and only such a democratic centralism can guarantee the victorious completion of the above-mentioned principles, tasks, and so on.

　　我们的方向
    （中华职业教育社一九五○年四月工作讨论会通过，第三次常务理事会批准）
    我们这一批教育工作者，中华职业教育社及其所属各单位的工作人员，怀着万分兴奋的心情，于四月五日至十一日在北京举行了解放以后的第一次全国工作讨论会，对本社过去的工作，作了坦白的、深刻的报告和检讨，进而规定了今后本社工作的路线、立场、方针、任务和制度。
  路线
    首先是路线问题。本社成立迄今，恰好三十三年。三十三年前，正是中国人向西方资本主义寻求“真理”的时候。经济上，第一次世界大战给了中国工商业暂时抬头的机会。中国人对国家一般的设想和经济情况，要求教育变个样子，从毕业生的学非所用，毫无出路变为使学生个个获得谋生的技能，适应民族工商业的干部需要。本社的成立以及职业教育这一主张的提出，就是那时中国社会发展的反映。就当时的情况说，这代表了改良主义路线进步的一面。真正的问题，由于帝国主义封建主义顽强的存在，自然并没有因教育上的变化而得到解决。
    由于过去反动统治者一贯的压迫和欺诈，本社曾在一定的时期内，抱着超政治的态度，只搞教育，避免和实际政治发生密切的关系。这种超政治的态度产生了两个后果，一个是使本社得在极端恶劣的环境下自存自全，一个是使本社未能及早主动地接受革命的领导，减少了可能起的更大的作用。
    改良主义、超政治的态度，从九一八事变起，经历了抗日战争，解放战争两个时期，已经得到事实的修正，代之以一步一步地向革命力量靠拢。三十三年的旅程，是一个由改良主义、超政治态度转变成一面倒向人民革命阵营的旅程。在这段旅程里，很惭愧，本社一直走得很慢，也很累、很苦，但是千回百折，从未后退，到今天，本社已经自觉地积极地认清人民民主革命的路线，决心在教育战线上，努力完成自己的历史任务。
  立场
    其次是立场问题。改良与革命，超政治和一面倒向人民，基本的区别在阶级立场的不同。以前中国的职业教育，从它的本质看，是属于资本主义范畴内的教育，因而它的基本立场，也就不能不是资产阶级的立场。所谓改良主义，所谓超政治态度，恰好是民族资产阶级和小资产阶级意识的反映。本社一开始虽然就提出了“替中国和世界谋增加生产的准备”“使无业者有业，有业者乐业”一类颇有远景的口号，但站在资产阶级的立场，是没法圆满地实现这些口号的。现在，中国社会已经进入新民主主义的阶段，本社必须站在劳动人民的立场，联系民族资产阶级和小资产阶级，积极地负起历史的使命，全心全意地为工农阶级服务，以促进新民主主义的国家建设。
  方针
    再次是方针问题。本社是个私人负责的教育工作团体。在过去，无论是业务、人事、作风，大体上本社的确是另有一套，以区别于当时的反动政府。由于本社的工作大致还符合人民的利益，而反动政府则只知道为极少数人的利益服务，所以，本社是“私”其表而“公”其里，和反动政府的“公”其表而“私”其里，成为强烈的对照。过去的方针是正确的，私所应私，和反动政府界限分明。现在环境和以前完全不同，政府是人民的政府，它所要推行的教育，是比我们所设想的和人民利益更紧密更完善联系着的教育。在这样情况下，我们的方针便应该是“化私为公、公私合一”。本社真是万分欣幸可以将多年培育起来的私人事业，有步骤地贡献给我们自己的政府。这样做只有使本社的影响更扩大、垂于久远。不过，“化私为公”并不是说本社已经无事可为，恰恰相反，在确立了这样方针以后，我们发现本社还担负相当重大的任务；并不是过了一夜，便可对于所办的事业完全不管，这不是对人民负责的态度。我们要把各种事业办得更好，以提高工作的积极性和创造性来稳步实现上述的方针。首先，我们必须把握国家的政策，使本社的业务，配合在政府整个计划之中。加强现有工作，稳步前进，在可能而又更合于人民利益的前提下，彻底实行“化私为公、公私合一”，使本社的一切工作，成为国家教育事业体系中的一个组成部分。
  任务
    再次是任务问题。为着巩固工人阶级的领导，为着迎接即将到来的经济建设的高潮，政府现正注意技术教育的推广和业余教育的倡导，这两种教育，恰好是本社多少年来积极从事，尚有成绩的方面。从这一点看，也可以说，本社的业务已经自然地配合了政府的计划。我们要努力的，是如何在原有的基础上加强工作。技术教育与业余教育之中，我们更应以后者为重点，因为劳动者文化、业务水平的提高，不独有助于技术的改进，且为造就新型知识分子的一个有效方法。我们要把多年来办理技术教育和业余教育的经验，研究改进，协助政府完成当前这十分迫切的培育技术人才和提高劳动者文化、业务水平的任务。
  制度
    最后是制度问题。本社是一个教育工作机关，也是一个群众团体。由于上述的我们自身种种的限制，加上反动统治者的压迫，本社虽有相当的群众影响，可并没有广大的群众基础。这一点，使本社的组织，没有能贯彻民主集中制的原则。今天，在新的环境里，我们要采用“从群众来，到群众去”的办法，使本社对广大的劳动者开门，成为一个主要是为劳动者服务，同时也是由劳动者当家的社。在这样基础上，一定能建立起健全有效的民主集中制来，也只有这样的民主集中制，才能保证上述方针、任务等等的胜利完成。
