　　Shulu Nanweibo Village Branch Leads the Masses to Expand Cotton Fields

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Nanweibo Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Shulu County, Hebei Province, played a pioneering and leading role in the cotton planting campaign. Comrade Jin Zixun, deputy secretary of the branch, heard county cadres say that in the spring plowing campaign, the masses should be mobilized to plant a large amount of cotton. After returning to the village, he and other branch committee members studied specific methods and began to take action. First, they mobilized propaganda and education cadres and theater troupe actors to form a propaganda team to carry out publicity in the streets and on high buildings. A meeting of party members was also held, calling on them to take the lead and mobilize the masses to break the old plan of planting less large fields and more cotton. After it rained on the 15th, branch committee members Jin Zixun, Yan Zhengzhai, and village head Xie Haoren (a party member) braved the rain to notify party member cadres to hold a meeting, calling on them to seize the favorable conditions after the rain to plant more cotton. Party members were asked to soak seeds early to cultivate cotton buds and plant early. Make preparations before the Grain Rain solar term, and start planting ten days after the solar term to drive the masses. Now party member Li Renzeng plans to plant 100% cotton. Jin Wenshuang has a total of 7.5 mu of land and plans to plant at least 6.5 mu. Generally, they also plant 60% to 70%. Jin Laomeng, Jin Zixun and others soaked seeds and cultivated cotton buds on the 18th. All party members are leveling cotton fields. Due to the leadership of the branch and the lead of the party members, all non-party administrative cadres in the village also actively led the cotton planting work. On the 16th, all 56 cadres in the village were divided into groups to help the masses make household plans and persuade the masses to plant more cotton. Now the masses in the whole village have expanded their cotton fields and are actively preparing to plant cotton. The masses Jin Laoqi has 6 mu of land and originally planned to plant 1 mu of cotton. After party member Jin Wenshuang persuaded him, he planted cotton on all but 2 mu of wheat fields. Li Laoqiu has 23 mu of land and originally planned to plant 5 mu of cotton. After being persuaded by party members, he now plans to plant at least 15 mu. The masses in the whole village plan to plant a total of more than 1,900 mu of cotton, which is nearly double the amount of last year (more than 1,080 mu). Now they have leveled the cotton fields, and some of the masses are soaking cotton seeds to cultivate cotton buds, preparing to plant. However, the branch and party members are not satisfied with these achievements. They are now reversing the old habit of the masses not planting cotton in dry fields (which are also suitable for cotton planting), and taking advantage of the rain to plant cotton in dry fields and ensure the realization of the original plan.

    【本报讯】河北省束鹿县南位伯村中共支部，在种棉运动中起了先锋带头作用。支部副书记靳子勋同志听到县干部说，春耕运动中要发动群众大量种棉，回村后即和其他支委研究出具体办法，开始行动。首先动员起宣教干部，剧团演员组成宣传队，在街头、高房进行宣传。并召开党员会，号召带头和发动群众打破旧计划少种大田多种棉。十五号下雨后，支委靳子勋、阎振宅、村长谢好人（党员）冒雨通知党员干部开会，号召抓住雨透后有利条件带头多种。要求党员早浸种籽育棉芽早下种。谷雨节前作好准备，节后开始下种，十天种齐。以带动群众。现党员李仁增计划种棉百分之百，靳文双共地七亩半，计划至少种六亩半。一般的也都种到百分之六、七十。靳老猛，靳子勋等十八号已浸种育棉芽。全数党员平整棉地。由于支部的领导，党员的带头，全村非党行政干部，也积极领导种棉工作。十六号全村干部五十六人分组挨户帮助群众做户计划劝群众多种棉花。现全村群众都扩大棉田并积极准备种棉。群众靳老起有六亩地，原计划种一亩棉，经党员靳文双解劝后，除二亩麦田外都种上棉花。李老秋有二十三亩地原计划种五亩棉花，经党员劝解后，现在至少要种十五亩。全村群众计划共种棉一千九百多亩，超过去年将近一倍（一千○八十多亩）。现已平整棉田，部分群众浸棉籽育棉芽，准备下种。但支部和党员并不满足于这些成绩，现正扭转群众不在旱田（也适合种棉）种棉的旧习惯，趁雨后突击种旱田棉花和保证原计划的实现。（杏田、根茂）
