　　Striving to Overcome Technologically Conservative Thinking
    Fengshan Power Plant Successfully Completes Full Load Test
    [Report from this Newspaper] The No. 4 turbine of the Fengshan Power Plant of the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau has successfully completed a full load test, setting an example of overcoming the phenomenon of wasted mechanical equipment. This is the result of breaking with technologically conservative thinking. The No. 4 machine of the Fengshan Power Plant is an extraction turbine, with a nameplate standard output of 1200 kilowatts, a maximum output of 1500 kilowatts, and a pure condensate (non-extraction) output of 1200 kilowatts. The National Electric Power Conference in February stipulated that its equipment quota was 1500 kilowatts and required that the equipment capacity be reached. However, when the plant discussed the equipment quota of No. 4 machine, many employees could not understand it ideologically. Some emphasized objective reasons, and some clung to the stale technical "experience" of the past Japanese puppet regime. Even some responsible persons of the Electric Power Bureau and the Fengshan Power Plant initially felt that they were not fully confident. Therefore, it was decided to conduct a full load test. First, the employees were thoroughly mobilized and encouraged. Taking advantage of the opportunity to shut down the power to clean the furnace, the mechanical parts of the machine and furnace were thoroughly inspected and cleaned. The second step was a thorough discussion, and a relatively detailed test plan was determined. The test method was to use water resistance, with each increase in load not exceeding 200 kilowatts.
    At 8:00 a.m. on the 5th, the test run began. At 8:45, electricity was generated. Depending on the condition of the boiler and turbine, the load was gradually increased, and the throttle lever of the high-pressure regulator was raised twice to stabilize the speed. At around 10:00, the load rose to 1200 kilowatts, and the extraction pressure rose to 3.5 kilograms. As the load increased, the extraction pressure also rose. At around 11:00, the load rose to the rated output of 1500 kilowatts, the extraction pressure rose to 5 kilograms, and the vacuum was 695 mm. The circulating water temperature was 12.5 degrees Celsius at the start of the test and 14 degrees Celsius at the outlet. At full load, the inlet temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius and the outlet temperature was 33 degrees Celsius. The results proved that there were no problems with the turbine and electrical equipment, and the full load test was successfully completed.

　　努力克服技术保守思想
    凤山电厂全负荷试验成功
    【本报讯】石家庄电业局凤山发电厂四号透平机，已胜利完成全负荷试验，树立了克服机械设备浪费现象的榜样，这是打破技术保守思想的结果。凤山发电厂四号机系抽汽透平机，名牌规定标准出力为一二○○千瓦，最大出力为一五○○千瓦，纯复水（不抽气）出力为一二○○千瓦。二月全国电业会议规定其设备定额为一五○○千瓦，并要求达到设备容量。但该厂在讨论四号机设备定额时，许多职工思想上搞不通，有的强调客观原因，有的抱泥于过去日伪统治时期陈腐的技术“经验”，连电业局及凤山发电厂某些负责人，开始也认为没有十分把握，为此，遂决定作一次全负荷试验。首先，深入启发动员职工，利用停电洗炉的机会，将机炉各部机械作了比较彻底的检修和擦洗工作。第二步是经过周密的讨论，决定了比较详细的试验计划。试验的方式是用水抵抗，每次增加负荷不超过二○○千瓦。
    五日晨八时，开始试验运转，八时四十五分发电，视锅炉及汽机的情形，陆续增加负荷，将高压调整器之油门杆升高两次，使调速平稳。十时左右负荷升至一二○○千瓦，抽汽压力升至三·五公斤，负荷增加，抽汽压力亦随之上升。十一时许，负荷升至定额出力一五○○千瓦，抽汽压力升至五公斤，真空为六九五粍。循环水于开始试验时吸温一二·五度（摄氏），排温一四度，全负荷时吸温一五·五度，排温三三度。结果证明：汽机、电气都没有问题，胜利完成全负荷试验。
