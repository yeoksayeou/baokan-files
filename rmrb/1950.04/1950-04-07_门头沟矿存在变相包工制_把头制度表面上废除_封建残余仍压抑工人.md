　　Mentougou Mine Exists in Disguised Contracting System
　　Foreman System Abolished in Name, Feudal Remnants Still Suppress Workers
　　Some Leading Cadres of the Mine Once Advocated Thoroughly Correcting This Phenomenon, But Were Not Adopted.
　　[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Lin Li reports: The production grassroots organization of the Mentougou Mine, affiliated to the Beijing West Coal Mine Company, is still controlled by the former contracting counter (i.e., foreman system) personnel. The production enthusiasm of workers is suppressed, and production efficiency is lower than other state-owned coal mines in North China. Among the leading cadres of the mine, some once advocated thoroughly abolishing this disguised contracting system, but this correct opinion failed to pass at the meeting.
　　The mine currently has 2,664 employees. There are 1,412 piece-rate workers underground, managed by ten production teams. Each team has a team leader, three management personnel, responsible for leading work, recording work, receiving wages, receiving food, looking after workshops, and appointing and dismissing workers. From the perspective of the production team's tasks, powers, and organizational form, they are all the same as the contracting counter. The personnel within the team also remain the same as before. Among the ten team leaders, eight were managers, inspectors, or head foremen during the contracting counter era. At the same time, the mine stipulates an extra allowance for the leading and management personnel of the production team, that is, in addition to receiving a higher wage than ordinary workers in the team, the team leader receives an extra eight catties of rice per day; the squad leader and clerk receive an extra four catties of rice per day; the deputy squad leader receives an extra two and a half catties of rice per day. This unreasonable allowance is calculated monthly, and is available even if no work is done. According to Comrade Zhang Zhan of the mine's supervisory committee, this expense is equivalent to adding one hundred workdays per day. In addition, the team leaders also use the right to receive and distribute workers' food and wages to "eat tails" and "eliminate zeros" (that is, swallowing the remainders or fractions of workers' wages. This is also one of the methods used by the contracting counter to exploit workers). In August last year, workers in the fourth team of the mine checked the accounts for two or three months and found nine cases of corruption, totaling 2,102 catties of millet, plus 121 catties of rice and white flour.
　　Workers' production enthusiasm is stifled, and the coal production rate is lower than other state-owned coal mines in North China.
　　Regarding the deployment and appointment and dismissal of workers, although the mine stipulates that it must be registered and approved by the personnel department, the actual power is still in the hands of the production team leaders. For example, the coal hole where the sixth team works can only accommodate 25 or 26 people per shift. However, the actual number of people on duty is more than 30 to 40. The overcrowding prevents workers from exerting their full strength, and production efficiency is relatively reduced, resulting in a decrease in the average wage of workers. The unreasonableness of this situation is obvious, but the mine cannot transfer the surplus workers to mines that need workers. Outside of the production team, the mine has another set of management personnel, such as coal masters, supervisors, foremen, etc. The task of these personnel is to prevent the production team from leading workers to "steal coal" (that is, violating the engineering plan and taking coal in dangerous areas). Facts have proven that as long as the production team exists for one day, the workers' production enthusiasm will be stifled for one day; and the coal production efficiency must be lower than other state-owned coal mines in North China. For example, the mine's efficiency in January was 0.18 tons, and the efficiency in February was 0.15 tons, that is, even with the highest efficiency in June last year, it was only 0.35 tons; while the production efficiency of other state-owned coal mines in North China is above 0.4 tons.
　　Eight out of ten team leaders do not work, and the workers dare to be angry but dare not speak out.
　　The existence of production teams also causes huge waste of national resources. Some cadres in the mine clearly see the actual situation, but most cadres are paralyzed by some formal changes. They believe that the production team leaders are democratically elected, there is no economic exploitation, and the team leaders participate in labor, which is fundamentally different from the contracting counter. But according to what the reporter has learned from all parties, the actual situation is not like this. Mao Shuduo, director of the mine's trade union, said: Last April, the abolition of the contracting counter was announced, but it was very incomplete, or more correctly, "new wine in old bottles." He recalled the situation at the time, saying: When the workers heard about the abolition of the contracting counter, they were extremely excited and demanded to accuse and bring certain extremely sinful contractors to justice. Later, the leadership decided to implement re-election, limited to one month to complete the election. At that time, the contractors and their lackeys carried out extensive activities in an attempt to regain power; due to the unsound organization and the difficulty in mobilizing workers, most of the elected production team leaders were old contractors and their lackeys. "Do the current production team leaders work?" Zhang Ming, a trade union cadre of the mine, said: "Two team leaders have not done contracting work in the past, and now they work well; among the eight who have done contracting work or worked as foremen, at least six are completely not working." The reporter also checked the attendance records of the team leaders going down the well. Jin Quanzhang, the leader of the sixth team, has not worked more than 16 days a month in the past five months, usually only about ten days. "What does he do when he is at work?" The workers in the team replied: "He just sleeps when he goes down the well." (Reporter's note: The workers in the team dared to say this because Jin Quanzhang ran away with the wife of worker Huang in mid-March. Otherwise, ordinary workers would not dare to say bad things about the team leader.)
　　The persons in charge of Mentougou Mine have also studied the editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," but have not implemented it into actual work. Some opinions advocating abolishing the remnants of the contracting counter and mobilizing workers have not been adopted by the persons in charge of the mine. The reporter suggests that the leading comrades of Mentougou Coal Mine should take immediate action in accordance with the circular of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government on March 21 on "Abolishing the Foreman System" to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the contracting counter in the mine.

### 门头沟矿存在变相包工制  把头制度表面上废除  封建残余仍压抑工人

　　门头沟矿存在变相包工制
    把头制度表面上废除  封建残余仍压抑工人
    该矿领导干部中曾有人主张彻底纠正这种现象，但竟未被采纳。
    【本报讯】记者林里报道：京西煤矿公司所属门头沟矿的生产基层组织，迄今依然掌握在过去的包工柜（即把头制）人员手中。工人的生产积极性受着压抑，生产效率较华北其他国营煤矿均低。在该矿的领导干部中，曾经有人主张彻底废除这种变相的包工制，但是这种正确意见，并未能在会议上通过。
    该矿现有职工二千六百六十四人。井下计件工人有一千四百十二名，分别由十个生产组管理。每组有组长一名、管理人员三名，负责领工、记工、领薪、领粮、看工房、及任免工人等事宜。组长不劳动，他手下有正副班长各三人，直接领导工人生产。从生产组的任务、职权与组织形式来看，均和包工柜相同。组内人员也依然如旧。在十个组长中，有八个是包工柜时的经理、查头子或大头子。同时矿方给生产组的领导人员和管理人员规定了一种额外津贴费，即组长除在本组领取一份比普通工人为高的工资外，每日再领额外津贴八斤米；班长、事务员每日领额外津贴四斤米；副班长每日领额外津贴二斤半米。这种不合理的津贴是按月计算，不做工也一样有。据该矿监委张栴同志谈：这项开支等于每天多加一百工。此外，组长们还利用领发工人粮款的权利，从中“吃尾”、“没零”（即吞没工人工资的尾数或零数。这也是包工柜剥削工人的方法之一）。该矿第四组工人在去年八月清查两三个月的账目，就查出九项贪污事件，合小米二千一百零二斤，另外有大米、白面等一百二十一斤。
    工人们的生产积极性遭到窒塞，产煤率低于华北其他国营煤矿。
    关于工人的调配与任免，矿方虽规定要经人事科登记批准，但实权依然操在生产组长手中。如第六组工作的煤洞，每班只能容纳二十五、六人。实际上班人数却有三十多至四十人。人员拥挤，力量不能发挥，生产效率相对降低，工人平均工资因而减少。这种情况的不合理是很显然的，但是，矿方却不能把多余的工人调到需要工人的矿井去。在生产组之外，矿方另有一套管理人员，如煤师、监工、领班等。这些人员的任务，就是防止生产组领着工人去“偷煤”（即违犯工程计划，到危险地带去取煤）。事实证明：生产组存在一天，工人的生产积极性就被窒塞一天；产煤效率也就一定要比华北其他国营煤矿都低。如该矿一月份效率为零点一八吨，二月份效率是零点一五吨，即以去年六月的最高效率来看，亦仅零点三五吨；而华北其他国营煤矿的生产效率，均在零点四吨以上。
    十个组长八个不劳动，工人对此敢怒不敢言。
    生产组的存在，同时造成国家资财的巨大浪费。对于其中实际情况，该矿有一部分干部看得是很清楚的，但多数干部却为一些形式上的改变所麻痹。他们认为：生产组长是民主选举的，没有了经济剥削，组长都参加劳动，这些和包工柜有着基本的区别。但据记者从各方了解，实际情形并非如此。该矿工会主任毛树多说：去年四月曾经宣布过废除包工柜，但是非常不彻底，更正确的说是“换汤不换药”。他回忆当时情况说：工人听说废除包工柜，个个兴奋异常，要求控诉和法办某些罪恶多端的包工头。后来领导上决定实行改选，限一月选举完。当时包工头及其爪牙即大肆活动，企图重掌大权；由于组织不健全，工人发动不易，所以当选生产组长的大部是旧日的包工头及其爪牙。“现在的生产组长劳动吗？”该矿工会干部张明说：“有两个组长过去没有干过包工，现在劳动还好；有八个干过包工或工头的，至少其中六个是完全不劳动的。”记者也曾查看各组长的下井上班账，第六组组长金全章，在近五个月内，每月上班没有超过十六天，通常只有十天左右。“上班时间他干一些什么呢？”该组工人回答说：“他到井底下也是睡觉。”（记者按：该组工人所以敢这样说，是因为金全章于三月中旬拐了工人黄某的老婆偷跑了。否则，一般工人是不敢说组长不好的。）
    门头沟矿的负责人也学习了《学会管理企业》的社论，但是没有贯彻到实际工作中去。一些主张废除包工柜残余，发动工人的意见，还没有被该矿负责人所采纳。记者建议门头沟煤矿领导同志，应根据三月二十一日中央人民政府燃料工业部“废除把头制度”的通令，立即行动起来，彻底肃清该矿包工柜的残余。
