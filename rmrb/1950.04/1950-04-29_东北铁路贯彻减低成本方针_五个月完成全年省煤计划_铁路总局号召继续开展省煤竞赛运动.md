　　Northeast Railway Implements Cost Reduction Policy
    Five Months to Complete Annual Coal Saving Plan
    Railway Bureau Calls for Continued Coal Saving Competition
    [This Newspaper News] Northeast Daily News reported: The "Northeast Railway Machinery Conference" in September last year decided on the task of "saving 100,000 tons of locomotive coal on the entire line from October 1949 to the end of September 1950." Due to the crew members' thorough implementation of the "One, Two, Three" coal saving movement and the efforts of all employees of the locomotive depot, the task was completed and exceeded seven months ahead of schedule at the end of February this year. A total of 123,727 tons of coal were saved in these five months. Among them, the Jilin Bureau saved the most, and the Qiqihar Bureau saved the least, which has not yet reached the standard.
    This coal saving campaign has generally aroused the attention of leading cadres and employees. In order to improve heat transfer efficiency, the crew members drilled into the boiler to shovel water rust and brush the inner fire chamber plate. In November of last year, a mixed coal movement was launched (that is, mixing good coal with bad coal to save good coal), and the use of coal was greatly saved.
    The annual coal consumption of the Northeast Railway accounts for approximately 17% of the total coal output in Northeast China. It is the largest expenditure in the Northeast Railway's funding, equivalent to approximately 15% to 20% of the entire line's operating expenses. The locomotive department consumes the most coal in the entire line, accounting for approximately 90% of the entire line's coal consumption; locomotive operation coal consumption accounts for approximately 90% of the entire locomotive department's coal consumption. The proportion of locomotive coal consumption is the highest in locomotive cost, averaging 40% of the total locomotive expenditure. This saving of more than 120,000 tons will reduce a large amount of expenditure for the country, which is of great significance for overcoming the country's financial difficulties and reducing railway costs.
    According to the state's annual coal saving task for the Northeast Railway this year, it is 124,000 tons, plus 8,000 tons of coal to make up for last year's waste and losses, totaling 132,000 tons. In order to achieve this goal, the Railway Bureau recently issued an order to "Carry out a Fuel Saving Competition Movement," calling for further improvement of thermal technology and extensive development of coal saving movements. The Political Department of the East China Railway and the Production Department of the East China Railway Trade Union have also issued notices, calling on party organizations and trade unions at all levels to mobilize all employees to work hard to complete this task.

### 东北铁路贯彻减低成本方针  五个月完成全年省煤计划  铁路总局号召继续开展省煤竞赛运动

　　东北铁路贯彻减低成本方针
    五个月完成全年省煤计划
    铁路总局号召继续开展省煤竞赛运动
    【本报讯】东北日报消息：去年九月东北铁路机务会议决定的“由一九四九年十月到一九五○年九月末一年间全路节省机车用煤十万吨”的任务，由于乘务员贯彻执行“一、二、三”省煤运动及机务段全体员工的努力，已于今年二月末提前七个月完成并超过了任务。这五个月中共节省煤十二万三千七百二十七吨。其中以吉林局节省最多，最少的为齐齐哈尔局，还未达到标准。
    此次的省煤运动，普遍引起领导干部及员工的重视，各段为了提高传热效率，乘务员都钻进锅炉铲水锈，刷内火室钣。去年十一月更发动混煤运动（即好煤与坏煤掺起来烧，节省好煤），使用煤大大节省。
    东北铁路全年用煤量，大约占全东北煤的总出产量百分之十七。是东北铁路经费中最大的一笔开支，等于全路经常费的百分之十五到二十左右。全路用煤最多的是机务部门，用煤量大约占全路用煤量的百分之九十；机车运转用煤又约占全机务用煤的百分之九十。在机务成本上，机车用煤的比重最高，平均要达到机务总支出的百分之四十。这次节约十二万余吨，将为国家减少大额开支，这对克服国家财政困难，减低铁路成本上，是具有很大意义的。
    按今年全年国家给予东北铁路的省煤任务为十二万四千吨，加上补省去年糟蹋亏损的八千吨煤，共计十三万二千吨。铁路总局为了达到这一目的，最近发布了“开展节省燃料竞赛运动”的命令，号召进一步提高热力技术，广泛的开展省煤运动。东铁政治部及东铁总工会生产部亦分别发出通知，号召各级党的组织及工会要很好的发动全体员工为完成这一任务努力。
