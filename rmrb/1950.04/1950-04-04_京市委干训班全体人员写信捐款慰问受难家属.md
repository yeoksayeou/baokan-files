　　Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class Sends Letter and Donations to Console Bereaved Families
　　[From Our Newspaper] After learning about the unfortunate incident at the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory, all students and staff members of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class immediately wrote a letter to the Communist Party General Branch of the Iron and Steel Factory, expressing condolences and sympathy to the deceased and injured comrades and their families. Each study group launched discussions. Worker comrades were very concerned about this, and the condolence letter from the workers of the Telecommunications Bureau said: "Your disaster is our pain!" Many railway workers cried during discussions, saying: "We must continue to do what the deceased comrades did not finish!" Everyone said that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident makes us pay attention to strengthening factory safety equipment, learning scientific knowledge, mastering modern technology, and learning to manage state-owned enterprises in the future.
　　Each group also initiated donations to console the injured comrades and the families of the deceased comrades. Workers from the Railway, Iron and Steel Factory, Clothing Factory, People's Printing Factory, Liulihe Cement Plant, North China Electric Power Administration Bureau, Shijingshan Power Plant, Mentougou, Tram Company, Automobile Company, Telecommunications Bureau, and others donated a total of 2,981,800 yuan. Workers from the Machine Factory and the 70th Ordnance Factory are also donating. This donation will be remitted by the Cadre Training Class to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for transfer to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory.
