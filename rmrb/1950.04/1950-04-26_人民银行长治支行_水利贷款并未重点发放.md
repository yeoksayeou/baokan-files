People's Bank of Changzhi Sub-branch
Water Conservancy Loans Not Issued with Priority

[This Newspaper reported] The People's Bank of Changzhi Sub-branch experienced some deviations in the issuance of water conservancy loans due to failure to adhere to the principle of prioritized distribution. This spring, the sub-branch originally planned to issue 132,000 jin of grain loans to support the digging of 600 water wells. The county sub-branch manager, together with the Agricultural Section and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, jointly decided to designate the second, third, and sixth districts of the county as key areas for water conservancy. The second and third districts were allocated 154 wells each, with each well receiving a loan of 220 to 260 jin of grain, each district should receive 33,000 jin of grain; the sixth district was allocated 190 wells, totaling 41,800 jin of grain; the three districts combined were allocated 100,7,800 jin of grain. The remaining 24,200 jin of grain were used to support 110 wells in other districts. This allocation was determined according to actual needs, and generally speaking, it was correct. However, by the end of the first ten days of this month, the second district had only issued 7,350 jin, the third district had only issued 17,900 jin, and the sixth district had only issued 27,000 jin. Judging from the above figures, none of them were issued according to the original plan, while ordinary villages issued more than the original amount; furthermore, some villages' water conservancy grain loans were not really used for well digging. For example, the water well grain loans in Bao Village were distributed to the masses at five dou per household as food consumption after the grain was received by the village. One borrower in the sixth district did not use the grain for well digging but used it to buy iron goods. Furthermore, Xia Qin Village only repaired four old wells but borrowed 3,200 jin of millet, and it is still unknown where it went! As a result, prioritized distribution was not achieved. Furthermore, deviations occurred in the loan method. For example, although some grain loans passed through the cooperatives, some did not, and in some cases, the sub-branch issued loans based on a letter written by the village cadres.

In addition, the Special District Office allocated 10,000 jin of millet for agricultural tools loans and 19,000 jin of millet for breeding stock loans. The sub-branch has loaned all of it to the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, but no contract was signed with the County Cooperative. The agricultural tools loans were only for plows, seeders, and harrows, with no other agricultural tools, and there were no specific figures. When they will be made was also not mentioned. The breeding stock loans only stated that they were loaned to the county to purchase from other districts, but what kind of draught animals to buy, when they will return, and where the breeding stock will be loaned in the future, etc., were not well researched and discussed and decisions were not made. After discovering the above situation, the People's Bank of Changzhi Special District Office immediately convened rural workers to correct the deviations and sent an inspection team to conduct inspections and correct them.

　　人民银行长治支行
    水利贷款并未重点发放
    【本报讯】人民银行长治支行在发放水利贷款中因未能掌握重点发放原则，致发生若干偏差。该行今春原拟发放贷粮一十三万二千斤，扶助挖水井六百眼；县支行经理与农业科、县供销社共同研究决定以该县二、三、六区为水利重点区。二、三两区每区各一百五十四眼井，每眼贷粮二百二十斤至二百六十斤，每区应贷粮三万三千斤；六区一百九十眼井，共贷粮四万一千八百斤；三个区共贷粮十万零七千八百斤。其余二万四千二百斤粮用以扶植其他各区一百一十眼井。此种分配系按实际需要确定，故一般说来是正确的。但二区到本月上旬末仅贷出七千三百五十斤，三区仅发放出一万七千九百斤，六区亦仅贷出二万七千斤。从以上数字看来，均未能按原定计划发放，而在一般村却发放超过原定数额；并且有的村水利贷粮并未能真正用到打井上去。如鲍村水井贷粮，贷到村后群众每家分了五斗就当吃粮消耗了。六区一个贷户贷到粮后没有用到打井上而用去买了铁货。又如下秦村仅修理旧井四眼，却贷了三千二百斤小米，而且还不知道用到何处去了！因之，重点发放就没有做到。并且在贷款方式上亦发生了偏差。如部分贷粮虽然通过了合作社，但也有一部分没有通过，甚至有的凭村干部写一封信，支行就发给了贷款。
    此外，专区办事处分配给农具贷款一万斤小米，种畜贷款一万九千斤小米，支行已全部贷给了县供销社，但未与县社订合同。农具贷款只打犁、耧、耙，没有其他农具，且无具体数目字，何时制成亦未提及。种畜贷款只说是贷给县里到外区去购买，但买什么耕畜，什么时候回来，种畜将来又贷到那里等等，均未进行很好的研究讨论并作出决定。人民银行长治专区办事处自发现上述情况后，立即召集下乡工作人员纠正偏向，并派出检查组进行检查予以纠正。（人民银行长治办事处合作股）
