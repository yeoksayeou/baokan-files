　　A Year of Great Upsurge in the World Peace Movement
　　Li Shenzhi
　　It has been a full year since the first World Peace Congress, attended by 2,005 representatives of 600 million organized people from seventy-two countries, was held in Paris and Prague on April 20th last year.

　　Peace-loving people around the world look back on the past year with satisfaction. This has been a year of unprecedented growth in the strength of the world's democratic and socialist camp under the leadership of the Soviet Union, and also a year of great development of the peace movement on an unprecedented scale and speed. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the birth of the German Democratic Republic, the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in construction, the continuous growth of the peace and democratic movements in capitalist countries, the vigorous development of national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, especially the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, have created a powerful people's force in human history that has never been matched.

　　The great achievements of the peace movement in the past year lie first and foremost in the rapid development of its scale and organization. According to a report by Lafargue, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, on March 16th this year, there are now peace movement organizations in eighty-one countries around the world, of which fifty-two have established national peace committees and are participating in the work of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. More than half of humanity, or more than one billion people, have participated in the great struggle for peace. National congresses for the defense of peace have been held in nearly thirty countries. Peace committees at local and enterprise levels have been widely organized in many countries. The peace movement has become a truly mass movement. In the People's Democratic countries such as Romania, 13,545 peace committees have been established in 45 of the country's 58 districts. In capitalist countries such as France, 8 million people, or more than one-third of the national electorate, have participated in the peace vote launched by the French Peace Committee. There is now no country in the world without a base for the peace movement, and there is no peace movement in any country that is not growing and expanding. The international peace movement not only unites under its banner millions of kind people regardless of race, nationality, religion or political opinion, but also develops on a solid organizational basis. As the Cominform resolution stated, "For the first time in human history, an organized peace front has emerged on an unprecedented scale."

　　The great development of the peace movement in the past year is that the peace movement has entered a new stage of taking practical action on a world scale to thwart war conspiracies. The struggle for peace and against war has become inextricably linked to the struggle for democracy and socialism.

　　In the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the peace movement inspires working people to engage in peaceful construction for a better future.

　　Rossiisky, foreman of the "Kalibr" factory in Moscow and winner of the Stalin Prize, declared at the All-Soviet Peace Congress: "I, like every Soviet worker, know for sure that everything we produce makes our motherland stronger and consolidates peace throughout the world."

　　The Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, in its appeal to respond to the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2, 1949, stated: "To respond to the war-mongers' plans, let us accelerate the completion of the Three-Year Plan, produce extra products, improve product quality, save costs, expand labor competitions, and strengthen labor discipline!" "Consolidate our country, closely unite around the People's Government, and we will strengthen the peace front, strengthen our alliance with the Soviet Union, and we will strengthen the peace front."

　　In Western capitalist countries, the struggle for peace is linked to the struggle for democratic freedoms and national independence, for bread and jobs, and for the social rights of working people. Under the leadership of the working class, the people, regardless of the high pressure from reactionary governments, launched the peace movement in every way and held peace demonstrations everywhere. As of the end of last year, 8 million people in France had directly participated in the peace movement. Seven million people in Italy signed peace petitions. Scandinavian countries organized relay races to pass on peace appeals. Peace trucks in Britain drove across the country to promote peace. After American imperialism announced its decision to arm Western Europe with ten billion dollars' worth of arms to drive the people of Western Europe into becoming cannon fodder for a new war with an active war preparation plan, almost all the working classes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries launched a vigorous movement to refuse to unload arms. From Oslo in Norway, Hamburg in West Germany, Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Antwerp in Belgium, to almost all ports on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts in France and Italy, from Tunis and Bizerte in North Africa to Sydney in Australia, a resolute and tenacious movement to refuse to unload arms was launched.

　　Transport workers in France and Italy have declared their refusal to transport arms, and workers in factories refuse to produce arms. The working people of Nice, France, threw the missile control machine that the United States was preparing to secretly transport to Tito into the sea. Workers in Montevideo threw seventeen tanks off the train. The slogan of oil workers in Chile, South America, is: "Not a drop of oil for the instigators of a new war!"

　　The working people of Western capitalist countries are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the invaders. With courageous and decisive actions, in the struggle against the war preparation of the imperialist bloc, they painfully struck the sinister blood claws of the war-mongers.

　　In Eastern colonies and dependent countries, the peace movement is linked to the national liberation movement. The victorious Chinese people have established a strong peace fortress in Asia, completely shattering the US imperialist plan to use China as a base for a new war. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has raised the national liberation movement of the entire colonial people to a level far beyond the past and has greatly weakened the strength of imperialism. On this basis, for the first time in history, it was possible to convene the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Conference in Beijing, the capital of New China. These two major conferences powerfully declared that the Eastern people "support peace based on equality among all nations of the world and oppose the war-mongers' conspiracy to launch a world war to dominate the world." Every victory in the national liberation wars waged in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaya, as well as armed struggles in other places, gave the peace movement new strength.

　　The promotion and leadership of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress have played a great role in the great achievements of the peace movement in the past year.

　　On July 29, 1949, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress decided to designate October 2 as the "International Day of Struggle for Peace." In September, the Standing Committee issued a declaration calling on the people of all countries to "demonstrate the irresistible power of peace defenders on a grand scale worldwide." On October 2, the people of sixty countries took to the streets and held unprecedentedly huge demonstrations. One million people in Shanghai participated in the grand parade. Hundreds of thousands of people in Paris participated in mass rallies. As the Standing Committee pointed out: "This day has demonstrated the success achieved by the united peace forces and the stability of the international connections that have been established."

　　On October 29 last year, the Standing Committee adopted a declaration at its second plenary session in Rome, putting forward three peace proposals: (1) Immediately start peace negotiations under international control to stop the wars now going on, especially in Greece, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya. (2) Immediately reduce armaments and personnel, declare atomic weapons illegal, and destroy them. (3) Sign a five-power peace treaty within the United Nations Organization. On December 16, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee notified the parliaments of various countries of the above suggestions, requesting them to urge their respective governments to adopt and implement them. On February 25 this year, the Secretariat of the Standing Committee decided to organize delegations to go to the parliaments of many countries to directly deliver these proposals to defend peace. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress won the heartfelt support of the people of the world, divided the lines between the peace camp and the war camp, and thus isolated the war-mongering groups. The parliaments of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries fully accepted the proposals of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Under the pressure of the people, the leaders of the reactionary majority in the parliaments of France, Italy, Sweden, Finland and other countries had to express that they could consider these proposals. The British Parliament refused to meet with the delegation. The Dutch government forcibly expelled the delegation. The United States, as the core of the war bloc, arrogantly and rudely refused the delegation entry. However, the voice of peace cannot be contained. The American people organized a committee to welcome the delegation. Slogans such as "Peace" and "Ban Atomic Bombs" appeared on the walls of the British Parliament. The war-mongers have become more isolated.

　　The third plenary session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, held in Stockholm in March this year, adopted a more clear-cut action program. The Standing Committee resolved to issue an appeal demanding the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and declaring that the first country to use atomic weapons is a war criminal. The Standing Committee called on the people of the world to sign this appeal. The Standing Committee also called on all good people around the world to select representatives to participate in the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Italy in the fourth quarter of 1950.

　　This is a resolution with great practical significance. The people of the world have been mobilized under this clear-cut action program, and the signature movement has begun in many countries. In places where the peace movement has not yet been very deep, this call has received a wide and enthusiastic response. In West Germany, which is under the strict control of the United States and Britain, tens of thousands of people signed the signature on the first day it began. In Britain, the Peace Committee decided to collect millions of signatures before the summer vacation. The National Labor Union Peace Committee in the United States has launched a signature campaign of 100,000 people. It can be expected that the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress will lead to the further expansion of the peace front and absorb more and more new forces to join this front.

　　The development of the peace movement in the past year shows that the forces of peace are rising and the forces of war are declining. The strength of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp has greatly exceeded the strength of the imperialist aggression camp. But the closer imperialism gets to its end, the more frantic it becomes. The clamor and actual preparations for a new war are intensifying. The danger of a new war exists. The task of peace advocates is to expand the peace movement in every way possible, making it a force capable of containing any adventurous behavior by imperialist aggressors, saving humanity from suffering the pain and disaster that comes with war again. Peace advocates have every possibility of completing this task. Because, as Lafargue, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, pointed out: "A peace movement of such a large scale has appeared in human history. What people have dreamed of for centuries has been realized. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the working classes of all countries, humanity will surely win the duel between peace and war. The day of human harmony and friendship will dawn all over the world."

　　世界和平运动巨大高涨的一年
    李慎之
    自从七十二国的六万万有组织人民的二千零五名代表，于去年四月二十日，在巴黎与布拉格举行第一次世界拥护和平大会以来，已经整整一年过去了。
    全世界爱好和平的人民以满意的心情回顾过去的一年。这是苏联领导下的全世界民主与社会主义阵营力量空前高涨的一年，也是和平运动以空前的规模与速度大大发展的一年。中国人民解放战争的胜利与中华人民共和国的建立，德意志民主共和国的诞生，苏联与人民民主国家建设的巨大成就，资本主义国家内和平民主运动的不断壮大，殖民地半殖民地国家内民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，特别是中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔订，造成了人类史上从未能与之匹敌的强大人民力量。
    一年来和平运动的伟大成就，首先在于其规模与组织的迅速发展。据和大常设委员会总书记拉斐德今年三月十六日报告，全世界八十一个国家已有和平运动的组织，其中五十二国已成立全国和平委员会，并参加和大常委会工作。全人类的半数即十万万以上的人口，已参加了争取和平的伟大斗争。近三十个国家已举行了全国拥护和平的代表大会。许多国家中已广泛地组织了各地方与各企业的和平委员会。和平运动已成为具有真正群众性的运动。在人民民主国家如罗马尼亚，全国五十八个区中，已有四十五个区成立了一万三千五百四十五个和平委员会。在资本主义国家如法国，已有八百万人，即占全国选民三分之一以上，参加了法国和平委员会发动的和平投票。世界上现在已经没有一个国家没有和平运动的基地，没有一个国家的和平运动不是在那里增涨和扩大。国际和平运动不但在它的旗帜下团结着不分种族、国籍、宗教或政治见解的千千万万善良人类，而且还在一个巩固的组织基础上发展着。正如共产党情报局决议所说的“人类历史上已空前第一次出现了一个有组织的和平阵线。”
    一年来和平运动的伟大发展，是和平运动已进入了以世界规模的实际行动来挫败战争阴谋的新阶段。拥护和平运动已越来越具体，越来越目标明确，并以越来越有效的方式进行。争取和平、反对战争的斗争，已和争取民主与社会主义的斗争，不可分地联系起来了。
    在苏联和人民民主国家，和平运动鼓舞着劳动人民为争取更美好的未来而进行的和平建设。
    莫斯科“加利伯”工厂的领班、斯大林奖金得奖人罗西斯基，在全苏拥护和平大会上宣称：“我和每一个苏联工人一样确实知道，我们所制造的每一件东西，都使我们的祖国更加强大，使全世界的和平更加巩固。”
    波兰工会中央理事会为号召响应一九四九年十月二日国际和平斗争日而发表的文告指出：“为了回答战争贩子的计划，让我们加速完成三年计划，生产额外产品，改进产品质量，节省成本，扩大劳动竞赛，加强劳动纪律吧！”“巩固我们的国家，紧密地团结在人民政府周围，我们就会加强和平阵线，加强我们与苏联的联盟，我们就会加强和平阵线。”
    在西方资本主义国家，争取和平的斗争，与争取民主自由和国家独立、争取面包和工作、争取劳动人民社会权利的斗争联系在一起。在工人阶级领导下，人民不顾反动政府的高压，以一切方式展开和平运动，到处举行了和平示威。截至去年年底止，法国已有八百万人直接参加了和平运动。意大利有七百万人在和平请愿书上签名。斯堪的纳维亚国家组织了传递和平呼吁的接力跑。英国的和平卡车开到全国各地去宣扬和平。而在美帝国主义宣布决定以十亿美元军火武装西欧，以驱使西欧人民为新战争炮灰的积极备战计划以后，几乎一切北大西洋公约国的工人阶级，都发动了如火如荼的拒卸军火运动。从挪威的奥斯陆、西德的汉堡、荷兰的鹿特丹与阿姆斯特丹、比利时的安特卫普，以迄法国与意大利在大西洋与地中海上的几乎全部港口，从北非的突尼斯、比塞大、以迄澳大利亚的悉尼，都展开了坚决顽强的拒卸军火运动。
    法国与意大利的运输工人已宣告拒绝装运军火，在工厂里的工人拒绝生产军火。法国尼西的劳动人民把美国准备偷偷运给铁托的飞弹控制机投到了海里。蒙特维的工人把十七辆坦克抛下了火车。南美洲智利的石油工人提出的口号是：“不要给新战争挑拨者一滴油！”
    西方资本主义国家的劳动人民不愿替侵略者当炮灰。他们以英勇果敢的行动，在反对帝国主义集团备战的斗争中，痛击战争贩子的罪恶的血爪。
    在东方殖民地与附属国家，和平运动与民族解放运动联系在一起。胜利的中国人民在亚洲建立了强大的和平堡垒，完全粉碎了美帝国主义以中国为新战争基地的计划。中国人民革命的胜利，使整个殖民地人民的民族解放运动提高到远远超越过去的水平，并大大削弱了帝国主义的力量。在这个基础上，历史上第一次有可能在新中国的首都北京，召开了亚澳工会代表会议与亚洲妇女代表会议。这两大会议有力地宣布东方人民“拥护世界一切民族间平等的和平，反对战争贩子企图发动世界战争称霸世界的阴谋”。在越南、菲律宾、马来亚所展开的民族解放战争，以及其它地方所进行的武装斗争，每一个胜利都赋予和平运动以新的力量。
    对于一年来和平运动的伟大成就，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的推动与领导起着伟大的作用。
    一九四九年七月二十九日，和大常委会执行局决定以十月二日为“国际和平斗争日”。九月，常委会发表宣言，号召各国人民“以全世界规模的宏大示威，来表示和平保卫者不可抗拒的力量”。在十月二日，六十个国家的人民走到街上，举行了空前巨大的示威。上海有一百万人参加了大游行。巴黎有几十万人参加了群众大会。如常委会所指出：“这个日子已表现出统一的和平力量所达成的成功与已建立起来的国际联系的稳固性。”
    去年十月二十九日，常委会在罗马举行的二届全会上通过宣言，提出三项和平建议：（一）立即开始在国际管制下进行和平谈判，以停止现在进行中的，特别是在希腊、越南、印尼、马来亚所进行的战争。（二）立即裁减军备兵员，宣布原子武器为非法，并予以销毁。（三）在联合国组织内签订五强和平公约。十二月十六日，常委会执行局将上述建议通告各国国会，要求敦促各该国政府采纳施行。今年二月二十五日，常委会秘书处决定组织代表团分赴许多国家的国会，直接递送这些保卫和平的建议。和大常委会的建议赢得了世界人民的衷心拥护，划分了和平阵营与战争阵营的界线，并从而孤立了战贩集团。苏联与人民民主国家的国会，完全接受了和大常委会的建议。法国、意大利、瑞典、芬兰等国国会内反动的多数派领袖，在人民压力下不得不表示可以考虑这些建议。英国国会拒绝接见代表团。荷兰政府以暴力驱逐代表团出境。作为战争集团核心的美国，蛮横无礼地拒绝了代表团入境。但是，和平的声音是遏制不住的。美国人民组织了欢迎代表团的委员会。英国国会墙上出现了“和平”、“禁止原子弹”的标语。战争贩子们更加孤立起来了。
    和大常委会今年三月在斯德哥尔摩召开的第三届全会上，采取了更鲜明的行动纲领。常委会决议发出呼吁书，要求无条件禁止原子武器，并宣布第一个使用原子武器的国家是战争罪犯。常委会号召全世界人民在这个呼吁书上签名。常委会并号召全世界一切善良的人们，选派代表参加即将于一九五○年第四季在意大利召开的第二次世界拥护和平大会。
    这是具有伟大实际意义的决议。世界人民已在这一鲜明的行动纲领下动员起来，签名运动已在许多国家开始。在和平运动迄今尚未十分深入的地方，这个号召都得到了广泛而热烈的响应。在美、英严密管制下的西德，签名开始的第一天，就有几万人签名。在英国，和平委员会决定在暑假前征集数百万人的签名。美国的全美工会和平委员会，已发动了十万人签名运动。可以预期，和大常委会的呼吁书，将导致和平阵线的进一步扩大，吸取越来越多的新的力量参加到这一阵线中来。
    一年来和平运动的发展显示：和平力量正在上升，战争力量正在下降。和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量，已大大超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。但是帝国主义愈临近末日，就愈疯狂。新战争的叫嚣与实际准备正在加紧。新战争的危险是存在着。和平拥护者的任务，就在于用一切方法扩大和平运动，使之成为足能遏制帝国主义侵略者任何冒险行为的力量，拯救人类免于再次身受与战争俱来的痛苦和灾难。和平拥护者有一切可能完成这个任务。因为正如世界拥护和平大会常设委员会总书记拉斐德所指出：“人类历史上已出现了规模如此壮大的和平运动。人们几世纪来所梦想的东西已经实现了。在苏联的领导下，在各国工人阶级的领导下，人类定将赢得和平与战争间的决斗。人类亲睦友爱的日子将在全世界破晓。”
