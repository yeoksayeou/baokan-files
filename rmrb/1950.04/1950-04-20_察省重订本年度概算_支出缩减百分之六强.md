　　Chahar Province Revises This Year's Budget, Expenditures Reduced by Over Six Percent
    [Report from our Zhangjiakou correspondent Li Yi]: According to the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work, the People's Government of Chahar Province has re-drafted and had approved by the Central People's Government the 1950 annual expenditure budget, reducing the originally proposed budget amount from December 30th of last year by more than six percent. Because the original budget was already relatively close to reality, the revised budget figures do not change drastically, but the ratios of various expenditures have changed significantly. Within the administrative personnel expenses, due to the re-organization and lowering of supply standards, the original budget of 80,087,000+ *jin* of millet has been reduced to 67,700,000+ *jin* of millet. In just the case of cadres from the Chabei District using horses for going to the countryside, the original plan of 1,600+ horses has been reduced to 675 horses. In terms of transportation expenses, public security and militia costs, by thoroughly implementing the spirit of focusing on recovery and fully utilizing existing transportation conditions, the new budget is less than three percent of the original budget. The municipal construction subsidies for the three provincial-level cities of Zhangjiakou, Datong and Xuanhua, originally budgeted at 5 million *jin* of millet, have also been reduced by thirty percent. One of the distinct features of the new budget is the increase in agricultural investment. This year Chahar Province plans to increase grain production by 3 million *shi dan*, so the current budget's agricultural investment amounts to more than 22 million *jin* of millet, an increase of more than 10 million *jin* of millet compared to the original budget. A considerable portion of the agricultural investment will be used for agricultural technology improvements.

　　察省重订本年度概算  支出缩减百分之六强
    【本报张家口讯】特派记者李翼报道：察哈尔省人民政府根据政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，重新拟定并经中央人民政府核准之一九五零年度岁出概算，较去年十二月三十日拟定的概算额减少百分之六强。由于原概算即比较切近实际，故重经核定之概算数字变动不大，但各项支出比率已有显著变化。在行政人员经费项内，由于重新编制及降低供给标准的结果，已由原概算的八千零八十八万七千余斤小米，缩减至六千七百七十余万斤小米。其中仅察北分区干部下乡用马，即已由原计划之一千六百余匹已减至六百七十五匹，在交通事业费及公安、民兵等费用方面，由于贯彻了重点恢复及充分利用现有交通条件的精神，新概算尚不及原概算的百分之三。张家口、大同、宣化三个省辖市，原编造之五百万斤米的市政建设补助费，也减去十分之三。新概算的鲜明特点之一是农业投资的增加，今年察省拟增产粮三百万市担，故现行概算中农业投资数达二千二百余万斤米。较原概算增加一千余万斤。农业投资中的相当一部分，将用于农业技术改良。
