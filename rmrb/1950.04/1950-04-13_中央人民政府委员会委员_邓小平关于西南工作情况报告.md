　　Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: The following is the full text of the report on the work in Southwest China by Deng Xiaoping, Member of the Central People's Government Committee (delivered at the Sixth Meeting of the Central People's Government on April 11, 1950): Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:

　　At this meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, I should give a brief report on the situation in Southwest China.

　　The Entire Southwest, Except Tibet, Has Now Been Completely Liberated

　　The troops of the First, Second, and Fourth Field Armies of the People's Liberation Army began the campaign to advance into Southwest China in early November. Our troops of the Second and Fourth Field Armies first annihilated the main force of the bandit army under Song Xilian on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan with swift and sudden movements. Taking advantage of the victory, they pursued fiercely, eliminating the Chiang bandit reinforcements along the way, and crossed the south bank of the Yangtze River in a wide front at an average speed of over a hundred li per day. Chiang Kai-shek fled in panic on November 29th, and parts of our Fourth and Second Field Armies simultaneously entered the urban area of Chongqing on the 30th. Before fleeing, the Chiang bandits carried out serious sabotage, especially causing severe electricity losses. Fortunately, our advance was rapid, and the efforts of the factory employees helped to save Chongqing's industry. This was an even greater victory than eliminating the enemy. Another route of our army also seized Guiyang and Zunyi in mid-November. At that time, the bandit Hu Zongnan was retreating from southern Shaanxi and Gansu, attempting to retreat into Xikang and Yunnan to make a final struggle. Our army, disregarding fatigue, divided forces and rushed from Chongqing and Guiyang to seize the line of Luxian, Yibin, Leshan, Daming, and Qionglai, completely cutting off the bandit Hu's retreat route to the south. General He Long, leading a corps of our First Field Army, opportunely pursued the bandit Hu from southern Shaanxi and Gansu, directly pressing on Chengdu. By this point, more than 400,000 enemy troops who had retreated from Shaanxi, Gansu, Chongqing, and other places and gathered around Chengdu were completely surrounded by us. After the Li Wen Corps, which attempted to break through to the south, was annihilated, the remaining units announced their uprising. The main battle in Southwest China, under the coordinated efforts of our three major field armies, came to an end on December 27th. The Southwest campaign, from the start of the campaign to its end, lasted only 57 days, advanced approximately 3,000 li, completed the campaign plan two months ahead of schedule, and eliminated approximately 900,000 remnants of the Chiang and Hu forces, including over 400,000 who surrendered or were captured and over 400,000 who revolted. The Southwest campaign's ability to achieve such a victory was due to Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the influence of the nationwide victory situation, and the invincible power of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the uprising announced by Generals Lu Han, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua on December 9th also played a good role in coordination.

　　After the liberation of Yunnan, the two armies of Li Mi and Yu Chengwan, who had already been forced to announce their uprising, engaged in rebellious behavior. Our Yunnan people's armed forces and a part of the Second Field Army cooperated with General Lu Han in the battle to defend Kunming. Subsequently, parts of the Fourth and Second Field Armies rushed to southern Yunnan from Guangxi. Because Yunnan has a vast liberated area, a long-tested people's army, and organized and conscious people in the liberated area, the rebellion of the two bandits, Li and Yu, could be quickly suppressed with their powerful cooperation and support. After Hu Zongnan's defeat in Chengdu, he fled to Xichang, attempting to gather remnants and consolidate the last stronghold in Southwest China, and to organize and command the so-called Southwest guerrilla warfare. A part of our army crossed the Jinsha River and Dadu River simultaneously from the north and south in late March, and liberated Xichang on the 27th. The remnants of the enemy are being mopped up. At this point, the entire Southwest, except Tibet, has been completely liberated.

　　Urban Reception Reaches a Stage; Confidence in Stabilizing Prices

　　With the development and conclusion of the war, we simultaneously carried out three major tasks: taking over the cities, transforming the original Kuomintang army, and storing public grain.

　　The reception of cities was relatively smooth because the cadres already had considerable experience, and it generally came to an end in January. However, the management aspect is complex, and there are no significant achievements yet, especially with the most difficulties in industry. Southwest China's industry does have a considerable foundation, which is a good condition for building the Southwest. However, during the Kuomintang era, these industries mostly served the war, and their raw materials mostly came from foreign countries. It is not easy to change them into peaceful industries now. Private enterprises also have many difficulties, and they generally ask the government to help them in terms of loans, solving raw materials, and purchasing products. We are first finding a way out for state-owned enterprises, striving to start work as soon as possible. With the gradual resumption of production in state-owned enterprises, the difficulties of private factories can also be gradually resolved.

　　Like other parts of the country, before the Lunar New Year, a serious phenomenon of price fluctuations occurred in various parts of Southwest China, causing anxiety among the people. We have taken effective measures to stabilize it. Speculators are still waiting for an opportunity to rise, and bandit activities have also affected urban and rural trade and the allocation of materials. We are stepping up the suppression of bandits to stabilize social order, while strengthening the organization and management of the market, protecting legitimate commerce, and cracking down on speculators. Because state-owned trading organizations control a large amount of major materials, we are confident in stabilizing prices in the future.

　　Another serious problem in cities is that the unemployed are asking for work and a way out. This problem can only be gradually solved in the process of restoring and developing production. Because we have taken over a large number of old employees, we must first provide them with education and resettlement before we can talk about other employment issues. In terms of the economic conditions in Southwest China, as long as we get through the difficult period this year, industry, agriculture, and commerce can be restored and developed, and the unemployment problem can also be gradually solved.

　　For the uprising Kuomintang army, military delegations have been sent to work in various units to help conduct education and transformation, so that they gradually have the conditions that conform to the people's army, and then it is possible to reorganize them in accordance with the principles of the People's Liberation Army. These troops have shown different performances after the uprising. Some parts have made great progress, while some parts are still active with special agents, and even rebellion incidents have occurred. We follow Chairman Mao's policy, patiently helping them to carry out the transformation, so that they can turn to the people's side, and so that officers and soldiers can get what they want.

　　Current Major Tasks in Rural Areas: Suppressing Bandits, Collecting Grain, Arranging Spring Plowing

　　In rural areas, there are three main tasks currently: one is to suppress bandits; two is to collect public grain; and three is to arrange spring plowing.

　　In February, more than 20,000 bandits were wiped out in Southwest China, and there are no statistics for March. The characteristics of the bandits in Southwest China, from the beginning, have been marked with obvious political characteristics. After the Kuomintang reactionaries failed in the Huaihai Campaign, they began preparing for their so-called guerrilla warfare. Sichuan Province alone trained as many as 5,000 so-called guerrilla cadres. In view of the historical experience of various liberated areas and the enemy's deployment in Southwest China, when the great battle around Chengdu had just ended, we pointed out that the harassment of bandits with Kuomintang agents as the backbone would inevitably develop, and thus put forward the policy of preparing for the second battle, that is, preparing to suppress bandits. Therefore, when the bandits rose up, the thinking of the People's Liberation Army did not feel sudden. However, because the troops entered the designated areas relatively late, the terrain and human conditions were not yet familiar, and the mobilization of the masses still took time, the bandit suppression work could not be immediately launched. Now the layout of local military work has been determined, and the mass organization has also begun. With our army's rich experience in guerrilla warfare and bandit suppression, it is not difficult to eliminate the bandits.

　　As soon as we arrived in Southwest China, we took over the cities on the one hand, and arranged to collect public grain on the other. Because we have received nearly 900,000 Kuomintang troops, about 400,000 old employees, plus the People's Liberation Army entering Southwest China, the number of people eating is close to two million. If the problem of eating and clothing for these two million people is not properly resolved, it will inevitably lead to great chaos. The figure of public grain in Southwest China in 1949 (4 billion catties) is not light, but according to our investigation, plus the part already collected by the Kuomintang, it still does not exceed 20% of the total grain harvest of the people, which is much lighter than the sum of various exactions in the Kuomintang era. It's just that the collection time is later, and at the same time, because our cadres are insufficient and not familiar with the situation, we have to use the old township baojia chiefs, so this grain collection is inevitably difficult. It only seeks to be relatively reasonable, and can complete the task in a timely manner, avoiding chaos, which is the most in line with the greatest interests of the people. According to the survey, the most unreasonable thing is that farmers have generally exceeded their share of the burden, but farmers are still very enthusiastic about paying because the burden is lighter than in history and they have been politically liberated. The landlords, because they always passed the burden on to the farmers in history, must exceptionally pay according to the share of the burden this time. Therefore, they use some unreasonable incidents to shout loudly, and even collude with bandits to sabotage the collection of grain. This phenomenon is being overcome. At the same time, we are also making appropriate and possible adjustments to some unreasonable phenomena. In short, the amount of public grain must be 100% guaranteed to be completed, otherwise the entire work will be in a passive and chaotic situation.

　　Spring plowing production has attracted attention in various places, and is coordinated with bandit suppression and grain collection. Where grain collection has been successful, production has been made the center of work.

　　The work of ethnic minorities in Southwest China is extremely important. The People's Liberation Army has been warmly welcomed in various ethnic minority areas. The Miao people in Guizhou are more enthusiastic about paying public grain than the Han people. We are following the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, uniting all ethnic groups to jointly build the Southwest and consolidate national defense.

　　The main working method after we arrived in Southwest China was to convene people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences at all levels. Where governments have been established, these conferences have generally been convened, and good results have been achieved, which has played a great role in overcoming difficulties. Governments at all levels are now strengthening the acceptance of democratic figures from all walks of life and representatives with contacts with the masses to participate in the work. Southwest China has rich material resources and a population of more than 70 million. The conditions for economic construction are very good. Although there are many difficulties at present, as long as we are good at working with people from all walks of life, good at using people's representative conferences at all levels, and good at uniting the people, all difficulties can be overcome.

　　中央人民政府委员会委员
    邓小平关于西南工作情况报告
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府委员会邓小平委员关于西南工作情况报告（一九五○年四月十一日在中央人民政府第六次会议上），全文如下：主席，各位委员，各位先生：
    在这次中央人民政府委员会会议中，我应该将西南的情况作一个简略的报告。
    西南全境除西藏外  业已全部获得解放
    人民解放军第一第二第四三大野战军的部队，从十一月初开始进军西南的战役。我二四两野战军部队首先在湘鄂川边以神速突然的动作一举歼灭匪军宋希濂部主力，乘胜猛追，沿途消灭蒋匪增援部队，并以平均每天百里以上的速度直迫长江南岸，宽正面地抢过长江。蒋匪介石十一月二十九日张惶逃走，我四野二野各一部于三十日同时进入重庆市区。蒋匪在逃跑之前，进行了严重的破坏，尤以电力损失最重，幸我进展神速，加以在厂员工努力保护，使重庆工业得到挽救。这是比之消灭敌人更为重大的胜利。我军另一路亦于十一月中旬先后抢占贵阳、遵义。其时，胡匪宗南正由陕甘南退，企图退入西康云南作最后的挣扎，我军乃又不顾疲劳分由重庆、贵阳以急行军抢占泸县、宜宾、乐山、大名、邛郲之线，完全截断了胡匪南逃道路，而我贺龙将军率领之一野兵团则适时地由陕甘南部尾击胡匪，直迫成都。至此由陕甘重庆等地退集成都周围的四十余万敌军，被我完全包围。在企图突围南逃之李文兵团被歼后，其余各部即宣布起义。全西南的主作战，在我三大野战军协同努力之下，于十二月二十七日宣告结束。西南作战从战役发起到结束，为时不过五十七天，前进约三千华里，提前两月完成战役计划，消灭蒋胡残余部队约九十万人，其中包括投降俘掳四十余万，起义四十余万。西南战役之能获得如此胜利，是由于毛主席领导的正确，全国胜利形势的影响以及人民解放军的无坚不摧的力量，同时卢汉、刘文辉、邓锡侯、潘文华诸将军于十二月九日宣布起义，亦起了良好的配合作用。
    云南解放后，曾发生原已被迫宣布起义之李弥、余程万两军的叛变行为。我云南人民武装及二野一部曾协同卢汉将军进行保卫昆明的战斗，旋以四野二野各一部由广西赶赴滇南，因为云南有广大的解放区，有久经锻炼的人民军队，有有组织有觉悟的解放区人民，在他们的有力地协同和支援之下，才能迅速地扑灭了李余两匪的叛乱。胡匪宗南于成都失败后，逃往西昌，企图收集残部巩固西南最后据点，并图组织和指挥所谓西南游击战争。我军一部已于三月下旬南北两路同时渡过金沙江及大渡河，二十七日解放西昌，残敌正肃清中。至此，西南全境，除西藏外，已获全部解放。
    城市接收告一段落  对稳定物价有把握
    随着战争的发展到结束，我们同时进行了接管城市，改造原国民党军队，及屯集公粮等三项主要的工作。
    城市接收，因为干部已有相当经验，比较顺利，大体都在一月份内先后告一段落。但在管的方面，问题复杂，尚无显著成绩，而尤以工业的困难最多。西南工业确有相当基础，这是建设西南的良好条件。但是这些工业在国民党时代，大都服务于战争，其原料多来自外国，现在要把它改变为和平工业，并非易事。私营企业亦有不少困难，普遍要求政府在贷款、解决原料、收购产品等方面予以帮助。我们正在首先为国营企业找寻出路，力求尽早开工。在国营企业逐渐恢复生产下，私营工厂的困难亦可逐渐地获得解决。
    同全国其他各地一样，在旧历年前，西南各地都曾发生物价波动的严重现象，引起了人心的不安。我们曾采取了有效的办法使之平稳下来。现在投机商人仍在伺机而起，而土匪活动也影响了城乡的贸易和物资的调拨。我们正在加紧剿匪，安定社会秩序，同时加强市场的组织与管理，保护正当商业，打击投机分子。由于国营贸易机关掌握了大量的主要物资，今后稳定物价是有把握的。
    在城市中另一严重问题，是失业者要求工作，要求出路。这个问题只能在恢复和发展生产的过程中，逐渐地加以解决。因为我们接收了大批旧职员，必须先使他们获得教育和安置，才能谈到其他的就业问题。就西南的经济条件而言，只要渡过今年的困难时期，工农商业当可获得恢复和发展，失业问题亦可获得逐步的解决。
    对于起义的原国民党军队，已派出军事代表团到各个部队工作，帮助进行教育改造，使之逐步地具备符合于人民军队的条件，然后才有可能按照人民解放军的原则实行整编。这些部队在起义后表现各有不同，某些部份进步较大，某些部份特务份子仍然活跃，以至发生叛变事件。我们一本毛主席方针，耐心地帮助他们实行改造，使他们转到人民方面，并使官兵各得其所。
    农村中当前主要工作：剿匪、征粮、布置春耕
    在农村，当前的主要工作有三个：一为剿灭土匪；二为征收公粮；三为布置春耕。
    西南土匪二月份曾被我消灭两万余人，三月份尚无统计。西南土匪的特点，从开始就带着明显的政治性质，国民党反动派在淮海战役失败后，就着手进行其所谓游击战争的准备工作，四川一省就训练了所谓游击干部达五千人之多。我们鉴于各个解放区的历史经验，和敌人对于西南的布置，在成都周围大战方告结束的时候，就指出了以国民党特务为骨干的土匪骚扰必然发展，因而提出了准备打第二仗即准备剿匪的方针。所以当土匪蜂起时，人民解放军的思想并未感觉突然。惟因部队进入指定地区时间较晚，地形人情尚未摸熟，群众发动尚需时间，故剿匪工作不能立即展开。现在地方军事工作布局已定，群众组织也已开始，以我军丰富的游击战争和剿匪经验，土匪是不难肃清的。
    我们一到西南，一面接管城市，一面就布置征收公粮。因为我们接收了近九十万的国民党军，四十万左右的旧有员工，加上进入西南的人民解放军，吃饭人数接近两百万人。如果不好好解决这两百万人的吃饭穿衣问题，势必大乱。西南一九四九年度的公粮数字（四十亿斤）是不算轻的，但据我们调查，加上国民党已征部份，仍未超过人民粮食总收获量的百分之二十，比之国民党时代各种苛杂的总和，还是要轻得多。只是征收时间较迟，同时因为我们干部不足，还不熟悉情况，不能不用旧的乡保甲长，所以这次征粮，困难是难免的，只求其做到比较合理，而又能及时完成任务，避免混乱，就是最符合于人民的最大利益。据调查，最不合理的还是农民相当普遍地超过了其应负担比例，但农民因为比较历史上负担要轻，政治上已获解放，故缴纳仍非常踊跃。而地主则因为历史上总是把负担转嫁到农民身上，这次必须破例按照应负担量缴纳，于是利用某些不合理的事件，大喊大叫起来，甚至有勾结土匪破坏征粮者。此种现象正在克服。同时我们对于某些不合理现象，亦正作适当而又可能的调整。总之，公粮数目必须百分之百地保证完成，否则将使整个工作陷于被动和混乱之中。
    春耕生产已引起各地注意，并与剿匪征粮配合进行。凡属征粮有成绩的地方，均已将生产作为工作的中心。
    西南少数民族工作，极端重要。人民解放军在各少数民族区域受到热烈的欢迎，贵州苗民缴纳公粮比汉人还要踊跃。我们正本着人民政协共同纲领，团结各民族，共同建设西南，巩固国防。
    我们到西南后的主要工作方法，是开各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议。凡是已经建立政府的地方，大体都召开了这种会议，收到良好的效果，对于克服困难，作用甚大。现在各级政府正在加强容纳各方民主人士和与群众有联系的代表人物参加工作。西南有丰富的物质资源，有七千多万人口，经济建设条件甚好，目前困难虽多，只要我们善于与各界人士共事，善于运用各界人民代表会议，善于团结人民，所有的困难都是可以克服的。
