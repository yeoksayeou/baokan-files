    Improving Collection Methods
    Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Responds to Zheng Xinjun

    Editor：

    On March 31st, at 1 PM, I went to the Dongjiaominxiang Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to buy government bonds. I noticed that the comrades counting the money only counted small denominations first, not large denominations. The small denominations kept increasing, and the large denominations had to wait for one or two hours. This is very unreasonable. I hope the bureau can correct this.
                                                      Zheng Xin

    Mr. Zheng Xin:

    Your suggestion has been answered by the Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau as follows:

    Our bureau divides the collection of government bond payments into four locations. Two locations each have one person responsible for collecting small amounts; the other two locations have more people and are responsible for collecting larger amounts. On March 31st, the people buying government bonds were very crowded, and more than 80% of them were paying small amounts. Each transaction only took a few minutes, which avoided congestion. However, those paying large amounts sometimes had to wait for half an hour or even an hour. Mr. Zheng Xin may have had to wait a long time because of this. This collection method may cause inconvenience to those paying larger amounts. We will study future collection methods to improve this as much as possible.
                                                      Editor

    改善收款办法
    京邮政储汇局答郑信君编辑同志：
    三月三十一日，下午一点钟我到东交民巷邮政储金汇业局去买公债、感到该局点钱同志只先点小数，不点大数，小数越来越多，大数就得等一二个钟头，这样很不合理，希该局能改正才好。
                                                      郑信
    郑信君：
    你所提意见，经北京邮政储汇金业局答复如下：
    本局为代收公债款，共分四处，有两处每处一人，负责收少额款项；其他两处人数较多，负责收款额多的。三月三十一日，买公债的人非常拥挤，其中百分八十之以上是款额少的，每份只需几分钟，这样可避免拥挤。而款额多的，有时要等半个甚至一个钟头才行。郑信先生可能因此久等。这种收款方法，可能使交款较多的人感到不便，我们将研究以后收款方法以尽量加以改善。
