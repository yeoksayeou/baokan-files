　　I Want to Achieve "Saying Everything I Know Without Reservation"
To the Editor:
    After reading the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" in today's newspaper, I feel even closer to the Communist Party.
    In the past, I never wanted to speak about individual Party members who made mistakes; moreover, I was not very willing to think about whether the thoughts and actions of Party members were right or wrong. Now, after analyzing it, there are roughly two reasons: First, I thought that what Party members did must be right, there was no need to consider it, and I was too lazy to think about it; Second, I was afraid that it would give them a bad impression of me. In the past, many backward classmates were always critical of Party members and Youth League members (sometimes bordering on malicious criticism), and in order to show that I was not very backward, it was of course best to keep my mouth shut.
    After reading this resolution, I feel that my attitude is very wrong. The former idea shows my intellectual laziness; the latter idea is the bad influence of the "golden words" my parents gave me in the past: "Eat more, talk less," "Better to say less than say more." Both of these ideas are unacceptable, and I must change them.
    From now on, I must use my brain more and achieve the point of "saying everything I know without reservation" to the Communist Party.

### 我要做到“知无不言言无不尽”

　　我要做到“知无不言言无不尽”编辑同志：
    读了今天报上“中国共产党中央委员会关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”后，觉得对共产党更加亲切了。
    以前，我对于个别党员同志犯了错误，从来不想说；而且对于党员同志们的思想行动，我也不大愿意想想是对的还是错的。现在我分析了一下大约有二个原因：一、我认为党员同志们所作所为一定是对的，没有考虑的必要，懒得去想；二、我怕因此而引起他们对我不好的印象，以前有好多落后的同学对于党员、团员同志们老挑剔（有时简直近于恶意的挑剔），我为了表示我并不十分落后起见当然少开口为妙。
    读了这个决议后，我觉得我这种态度很不对。前一种想法是表示我思想上的懒惰；后一种想法是以前爹娘给我的“金玉良言”：“多吃饭，少开口”、“多一言不如少一言”的坏影响。这二种想法都是要不得的，我得改掉。
    今后我一定多用脑子，做到对共产党“知无不言，言无不尽”的地步。
