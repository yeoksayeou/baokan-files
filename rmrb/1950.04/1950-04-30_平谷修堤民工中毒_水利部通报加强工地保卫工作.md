　　Pinggu Dyke Construction Laborers Poisoned
    Ministry of Water Resources Issues Notice to Strengthen Security at Construction Sites

    [This newspaper's dispatch] On the evening of April 11th, a sudden poisoning incident occurred in the First Company of the Second Battalion of the Third Section of the Pinggu County dyke construction laborers in Hebei Province. All one hundred laborers, including the mess hall manager and instructor, were affected. The symptoms included heartburn, vomiting, dizziness, weakness in the limbs, and stomach pain. In the nine most severe cases, there was bleeding from the nostrils, stiffness and tremors in the neck and torso, and constricted pupils. The company immediately administered emergency treatment using mung bean soup or chewing mung beans. The engineering office also dispatched four doctors to provide rescue efforts. Most of the laborers have now recovered and returned to work. Eight people still require further treatment. After the incident, an examination of the porridge eaten by the laborers that evening revealed the presence of poisonous substances such as arsenic or nux vomica.

    Currently, spring repair projects are in full swing across various regions. Tens of thousands of soldiers and laborers are participating in dyke construction and river management projects. To ensure the safety of the soldiers and laborers, reduce losses during work, and ensure the successful completion of the spring repair projects, the Ministry of Water Resources has issued a notice to engineering departments in various regions to raise vigilance, strengthen security work, prevent enemy agents and saboteurs from taking advantage of opportunities to disrupt operations, and organize medical teams to strengthen medical and sanitation work for soldiers and laborers.
