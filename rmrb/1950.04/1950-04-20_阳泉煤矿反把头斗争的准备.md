　　Preparations for the Anti-Ba Tou Struggle in Yangquan Coal Mine
　　By our reporter Lin Li
　　The state-owned Yangquan Coal Mine in Shanxi and all relevant departments have now completed all preparations for the anti-ba tou system struggle. A mass anti-ba tou struggle will soon be fully launched.
　　After this newspaper published the news on March 21 that the Yangquan state-owned coal mine's feudal ba tou were stifling production and cruelly exploiting workers, it aroused the attention of relevant departments. The North China Coal Mine Management Bureau immediately convened relevant departments for discussion and instructed the Yangquan Mining Bureau on March 23 to conduct in-depth inspections and carry out serious criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, it cooperated with the North China Coal Mine Trade Union to form a Yangquan Coal Mine Inspection Team to conduct on-site inspections. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Yuci Prefectural Federation of Trade Unions all sent cadres to the mining area to assist in the work. Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Yuci Prefectural Committee, personally participated in this work. The high degree of attention and strong assistance from the leading organs is one of the important reasons why the preparatory work for the anti-ba tou was able to proceed smoothly.
　　Regarding the issue of the ba tou system in the Yangquan Mine, the Yangquan Mining Bureau and some leading cadres of the Mining Union held inconsistent understandings. Advanced workers, Communist Party members, and staff members who were connected to the masses fully recognized this problem and repeatedly raised opinions against the ba tou. Shen Menghua, the current director of the trade union, actively made suggestions to the administrative side. Unfortunately, these opinions and suggestions were not adopted. On the contrary, many comrades did not recognize this problem. They initially denied the existence of the ba tou system, then admitted that it was an ideological and stylistic problem of individual people, or that it was a remnant of a remnant, and finally used the excuse that there was no new system to replace it. After the facts were revealed, the understanding was generally unified, but individual comrades still had doubts. To this end, the Yangquan Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party successively sent more than 20 cadres to conduct three repeated investigations and more than five meetings, finally affirming the existence of the ba tou system. Based on the two reports in this newspaper and the Central Fuel Department's circular on abolishing the ba tou system, they organized all mine cadres to study and reflect. In early April, they also launched a bottom-up inspection, so the cadres' thinking was basically consistent.
　　In order to further mobilize the masses and concentrate the workers' active demands for the anti-ba tou system, the mine held a training class for more than 130 advanced production individuals. The training class started on the 27th of last month and ended on the 6th of this month. According to the feedback from the trainees, the crimes of the ba tou were very serious, and what had been exposed was only a very small part of what actually existed.
　　At the same time, the Mining Bureau and the Trade Union also transferred 13 cadres and staff members, under the leadership of Director Bai Youzhi, with the Fourth Mine as the base, and absorbed more than 30 workers to participate in a special experiment on individual piecework and group responsibility systems after the abolition of the ba tou. The method of free association was adopted to divide them into two groups. When each group went down the pit to work on each shift, they were accompanied by cadres and staff members. The experimental results proved that the coal mining task that usually required nine workers to complete could be completed with only seven workers under the new system; if the conditions for innovation in mining methods were added, it could be completed with only four or five workers. During the experiment, the tunneling efficiency also increased from the original 1.8 or 1.9 tons to 2.7 or 2.8 tons. As production efficiency increased, workers' wages also increased. At this time, the workers happily said: "It's not that we don't want to change, it's that those ba tou and group leaders won't let us change."
　　On April 7, the Mining Bureau held an enlarged cadre meeting, focusing on examining the reasons for the existence of the ba tou system and specifically deciding on the principles and steps for carrying out the anti-ba tou system. After in-depth inspection, they further realized the crimes of the ba tou system and more clearly understood the importance of relying on the working class to develop production. Therefore, they determined the principle of carrying out an in-depth mass anti-ba tou movement under the principle of not hindering the completion of production tasks; at the same time, they established a group responsibility system and gradually moved towards an individual piecework wage system. The meeting decided to abolish the right of the big group leaders (i.e., ba tou) to recruit and dismiss workers, as well as their various economic exploitations of workers, and establish a direct relationship between workers and the mine. Some criminals with heinous crimes will be handed over to the People's Court for handling according to law after being reported and accused by workers. The Trade Union, the Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly, and the Mine Democratic Management Committee will be gradually reformed and rectified during the movement. The Yangquan Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also announced that Communist Party members who were originally ba tou and are still members of the general branch or branch committees will be temporarily suspended from their leadership positions and will be dealt with separately after the movement, based on their daily behavior and performance in the anti-ba tou movement.
　　In order to carry out the movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to fully mobilize the workers, on the 10th of this month, the Anti-Ba Tou Movement Committee was formally established, headed by the Yangquan Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as a unified leading organ, with Wang Jinlin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, as the director, Bai Youzhi, Director of the Mining Bureau, and Shen Menghua, Director of the Trade Union, as deputy directors, and the heads of various levels as members. Staff members from various places who came here to participate in the work were uniformly equipped by the committee. In order to avoid paternalism and substitution, the committee has clearly stipulated that the organ directly handling the problems is the Standing Committee of the Democratic Management Committee of each mine (because only the Standing Committee does not have ba tou members), and the committee only plays a guiding role.
　　All organizational and ideological preparations have been matured. What lies ahead is a vigorous mass movement. Let us wish the success of this anti-ba tou movement!

　　阳泉煤矿反把头斗争的准备
    本报记者  林里
    山西阳泉国营煤矿及各有关部门，现已完成反把头制的一切准备工作。群众性的反把头斗争，不日即将全面展开。
    三月二十一日，本报发表阳泉国营煤矿封建把头窒塞生产，残酷剥削工人的消息后，引起了各有关部门的注意。华北煤矿管理总局，立即召集各有关部门进行讨论，并于三月二十三日指令阳泉矿务局深入检查，开展严肃的批评与自我批评。同时，并协同华北煤矿工会联合组成阳泉煤矿检查组，前来现场检查。中共山西省委、省总工会、中共榆次地委及榆次专区工会，均抽调干部，前往矿区协助工作，榆次地委书记池必卿并亲自参加了这个工作。领导机关的高度注意与大力协助，是反把头准备工作得以顺利进行的重要原因之一。
    对于阳泉矿的把头制问题，阳泉矿务局与矿工会某些领导干部认识是不一致的。先进的工人、共产党员和连系群众的职员，他们充分认识这个问题，并且三番五次的提出过反把头的意见。现任工会主任申梦华，即曾积极向行政方面建议。可惜，这些意见和建议都没有被采纳。相反的是，有不少同志则不认识这个问题，他们始则否认把头制度的存在，继则承认是个别人的思想和作风问题，或者说是残余的残余，最后则以没有新制度代替为借口。经过事实的揭露，大体上虽统一了认识，但个别同志还有怀疑。为此中共阳泉党委先后派来二十余干部，进行了三次的反复调查和五次以上的会议研究，终于肯定了把头制的存在，并根据本报的两次报道及中央燃料部关于废除把头制的通令，组织全矿干部进行学习和反省。四月初又开展了自下而上的检查，因此干部思想基本上一致了。
    为进一步发动群众，集中工人对反把头制的积极要求，该矿举办了一百三十多位生产先进分子的训练班。训练班于上月二十七日开始，本月六日结束。根据受训人员的反映，证明把头罪恶十分严重，揭露了的只不过是实际存在的很小一部分而已。
    同时，矿务局和工会又抽调了十三个干部、职员，在白猷之局长主持下，以四矿为基点，吸收了三十余名工友参加，专门实验废除把头后的个体计件及小组负责制。采取自由结合的方法分编成两个组，每组每班下坑工作时，均有干部和职员相随。实验结果证明：一般用九个工才能完成的采煤任务，在新制度下，只用七个工就可完成；如果加上采掘方法革新的条件，只用四个或五个工就行了。实验期间，掘进效率也由原来的一点八或一点九吨，上升为二点七或二点八吨。生产效率提高，工人工资也随之增加。这时工人们都高兴的说：“不是我们不愿改，是那些把头、大组长们不叫改。”
    四月七日，矿务局又召开扩大干部会议，着重检查了把头制存在的原因，并具体决定了开展反把头制的方针和步骤。经过深入检查，又进一步认识到把头制的罪恶，更清醒的理解到依靠工人阶级发展生产的重要。因此确定了在不妨碍完成生产任务的原则下，开展深入的群众性的反把头运动的方针；同时建立小组负责制，并逐步走上个体计件工资制。会议决定取缔大组长（即把头）的招工解雇权。及其对工人的种种经济剥削，建立工人和矿方的直接关系。对某些罪大恶极的犯罪分子，在工人检举控诉之后，即送交人民法庭依法处理。工会、职工代表会及矿厂民主管理委员会，将在运动中逐步改造和整顿。中共阳泉党委会同时宣布：把头出身的共产党员，现仍为总支、分支委员者，暂停止其领导职务，待运动过后，再根据其日常行为及反把头运动中的表现分别处理。
    为使运动有计划、有步骤的进行，以达到充分发动工人的目的，本月十日，以中共阳泉党委为首，正式成立了反把头运动委员会，作为统一的领导机关，以党委副书记王金林为主任，矿务局白猷之局长、工会申梦华主任为副主任，各级负责人为委员。各地来此参加工作人员，均由该委员会统一配备。委员会组成后，即分赴各矿协助工作。为避免包办代替，委员会已明确规定：直接处理问题的机关是各矿民主管理委员会的常委会（因只有常委中没有把头分子），委员会仅起辅导作用。
    一切组织准备与思想准备均已成熟，摆在前面的是轰轰烈烈的群众运动，让我们预祝这个反把头运动的成功！
