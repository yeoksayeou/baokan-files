Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. The People's Governments in various parts of East China, in conjunction with spring plowing and production, have vigorously carried out various cotton planting preparation work such as promoting improved cotton varieties and expanding cotton field acreage, laying the foundation for completing this year's cotton production increase task.

Cotton produced in cotton-producing areas of East China suffered from declining cotton prices due to the dumping of foreign cotton during the reactionary rule of the enemy, puppets, and the Kuomintang bandits. In addition, years of water, drought, and insect pests have significantly reduced cotton production, causing great losses to cotton farmers, leading some cotton farmers to lose interest in cotton planting. In view of the above situation, the People's Governments of various cotton-producing areas successively convened cotton farmer representative meetings to explain the People's Government's policy of rewarding cotton planting and guaranteeing the interests of cotton farmers, eliminating the production concerns of the cotton farmers. At the same time, the Central People's Government actively supported cotton farmers, allocating 25 million catties of rice as cotton seed investment grain to East China, to purchase 24 million catties of high-quality cotton seeds such as Dezi cotton, Sizi cotton, Daizi cotton, and Kezi cotton in Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Northern Anhui, and imported 1,930 tons of high-quality cotton seeds such as Daizi cotton No. 15, Kezi cotton No. 100B, Sizi cotton No. 2B, and 5A from abroad, which were lent to cotton farmers in various parts of East China for sowing. In addition, the Central People's Government invested in the manufacture and purchase of 313 tons of insecticides and 5,100 pieces of equipment for the prevention and control of cotton diseases and insect pests. Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued a "Notice on Guaranteeing Reasonable Price Ratios for Cotton, Hemp, and Grain," effectively protecting the interests of cotton farmers in cotton planting. Due to the implementation of these measures, the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers has rapidly and universally increased. They have successively carried out water conservancy construction, wasteland reclamation and plowing, and fertilization with mud to expand the area of ​​cotton fields in preparation for timely planting. According to preliminary statistics, the total cotton planting area in East China this year will reach 15.43 million mu (an increase of more than 50% compared to last year), of which improved varieties of cotton fields account for approximately 2,700,050 mu (an increase of nearly three times compared to last year), accounting for one-sixth of the total cotton fields.

In order to systematically carry out the promotion, breeding, purity maintenance of improved varieties and technical guidance on cotton cultivation, East China has established 34 high-quality cotton seed management areas (with an area of ​​1,128,000 mu). In addition, East China has established ginneries and cotton farms with emphasis based on local conditions to centrally gin cotton and propagate improved varieties. Currently, there are 26 cotton farms in the entire region, which have propagated 7,710 mu of improved cotton varieties.

　　华东各地积极准备种棉
    政府保证合理比价贷给优良种籽
    棉农生产情绪高涨计划扩大种植
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东各地人民政府结合春耕生产，大力进行了推广棉花良种、扩大棉田面积等各项植棉准备工作，为今年棉花增产任务的完成奠定了基础。
    华东各产棉区所产棉花，在敌伪和国民党匪帮的反动统治时期因受外棉倾销的影响，棉价低落，又加年来遭受水、旱、虫等灾害，棉花产量下降很多，棉农所受损失很大，致使部分棉农对植棉兴趣不大。各产棉区人民政府鉴于上述情况，曾经先后召开了棉农代表会议，说明人民政府奖励植棉、保证棉农利益的政策，消除了棉农群众的生产顾虑。同时，中央人民政府又积极扶持棉农，拨给华东棉种投资粮二千五百万斤大米，用以在山东、苏南、苏北、浙江、皖北等地收购德字棉、斯字棉、岱字棉、珂字棉等优良棉种二千四百万斤，并向国外购进岱字棉十五号、珂字棉一百Ｂ号、斯字棉二Ｂ号和五Ａ号等优良棉种一千九百三十吨，分别贷给华东各地棉农播种。此外，中央人民政府又投资制造和购买了杀虫药剂三百十三吨，器械五千一百件，用以防治棉花病虫害。最近，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会又发出了“关于保证棉、麻与粮食合理比价的通告”，切实保障了棉农植棉的利益。由于这些措施的推行，棉农群众的生产情绪迅速普遍地高涨，纷纷进行兴修水利、开荒翻耕、施肥铺生（加一层河泥）等工作，以扩大棉田面积，准备及时播种。据初步统计，华东全区今年植棉面积将达一千五百四十三万亩（较去年增加百分之五十以上），其中改良品种的棉田约二百七十万另五千亩（较去年增加近三倍），占全部棉田的六分之一。
    为着有计划地进行良种推广、繁殖、保纯和棉花栽培技术上的指导工作，华东各地已设立了三十四个优良棉种管理区（面积为一百十二万八千亩）。此外，华东各地又根据当地具体情况，有重点地设立轧花厂和棉场，以集中轧花和繁殖良种。现全区已有二十六处棉场，共繁殖了棉花良种七千七百一十亩。
