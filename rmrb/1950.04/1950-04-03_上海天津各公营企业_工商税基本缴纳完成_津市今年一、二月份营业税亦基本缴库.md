Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd – State-owned enterprises in Shanghai have basically completed the task of paying industrial and commercial taxes from June 1949 to the end of February this year. As of the 1st, 206 units have completed tax payments, with tax revenue reaching 82.3 billion yuan according to preliminary statistics (including over 39 billion yuan in income tax and 43 billion yuan in business tax). The remaining few units that have not yet declared and paid taxes are continuing to declare and pay.

After the Ministry of Finance issued a notice regarding the payment of industrial and commercial taxes by state-owned enterprises, the Direct Tax Division of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau, together with the Goods Tax Division, convened a forum for state-owned enterprises to convey the central government's decision on the payment of industrial and commercial taxes by state-owned enterprises. At the same time, the East China Regional Taxation Administration also convened a meeting of responsible persons from various state-owned enterprises on March 19 to explain the significance of tax payment by state-owned enterprises. In order to strive for timely payment into the treasury, the Shanghai Municipal General Affairs Bureau, on the one hand, formulated measures for state-owned enterprises to pay taxes and principles for calculating income tax based on the central government's "Measures for the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Taxes by State-Owned Enterprises" and the "Five Resolutions and Notices," and the specific situation in Shanghai, notifying all units to pay within a time limit, overcoming many technical difficulties that arose. On the other hand, it systematically assigned cadres to contact the administrative departments of various taxpayer units, and before the deadline at the end of March, it also explained and persuaded units that held a wait-and-see attitude, delayed, or resisted, and focused on urging payment separately. Thanks to these efforts, the tax payment work of Shanghai's state-owned enterprises achieved the aforementioned results.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 2nd – The collection of industrial and commercial taxes from state-owned enterprises in Tianjin for 1949 and business taxes for January and February 1950 has been basically completed. As of the end of March, the total amount of the two tax items paid into the treasury was equivalent to over 35,445,500 catties of millet. Among the 188 state-owned enterprises in Tianjin that should have paid industrial and commercial taxes for 1949 (including ten units stationed in Tianjin from other places), except for 23 households that had declared but could not be assessed due to their income could not be calculated or the declaration materials were incomplete, and one unit that had not yet declared, the rest had declared and been assessed, and most had paid. A total of 193 state-owned enterprises should pay business taxes for January and February 1950, and all of them have completed the declaration procedures; 189 of them have been assessed, and 176 units have paid the taxes into the treasury. Currently, the Tianjin Taxation Bureau will strictly enforce the decrees of the Government Administration Council and impose a daily surcharge for late payment on the few units that failed to pay into the treasury on time.

The declaration work for the 1949 industrial and commercial taxes of Tianjin's state-owned enterprises originally started on February 4th. At that time, some enterprises delayed and hesitated to report due to the fact that their respective directly subordinate superiors failed to make timely decisions on tax payment, and some cadres had insufficient understanding of national taxation, which affected the progress of tax collection work. Since the joint meeting of the competent enterprise departments of the Central People's Government decided on the tax payment methods for state-owned enterprises on March 14th, the main difficulties in tax payment by state-owned enterprises were broken, and individual procrastinators also lost their excuses. In addition, the Municipal Taxation Bureau patiently carried out publicity and mobilization work, and assigned cadres to various enterprises to urge and help factories and households solve specific difficulties, so the declaration work quickly unfolded. For example, the "May 1st" Production Cooperative, affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, believed that the cooperative's accounts were difficult to calculate and difficult to declare. Tax Bureau cadres immediately helped it settle accounts and solve the enterprise's difficulties. In the declaration, some units performed very well. For example, North China Coal and Iron Company declared very early and patiently explained the company's accounting subjects and accounting system to the tax staff, which facilitated the tax bureau's assessment work.

　　上海天津各公营企业
    工商税基本缴纳完成
    津市今年一、二月份营业税亦基本缴库
    【新华社二日讯】上海公营企业已在基本上完成了缴纳一九四九年六月至今年二月底的工商业税任务，迄一日止已有二百零六个单位执行缴税，纳库税款据初步统计达八百二十三亿元（内所得税三百九十亿余元，营业税四百三十亿余元）。其他少数尚未申报缴款单位亦正继续报缴中。
    在中央财政部发出关于公营企业缴纳工商业税通知后，上海市税务局直接税处即会同货物税处召开了公营企业座谈会，传达了中央对公营企业缴纳工商业税的决定。同时，华东区税务管理局也于三月十九日召集各公营企业负责人开会，说明公营企业纳税意义。为着争取按时纳库，上海市总务局一方面根据中央发布的公营企业缴纳工商业税办法及五项决议通知和上海的具体情况，拟订了公营企业缴税办法及所得税计算原则，通知各单位限期缴纳，克服了不少技术上发生的困难；另一方面有计划地分配干部与各纳税单位行政主管部门联系，至三月底限期届满前，又对持观望拖延或抵抗态度的单位进行解释说服，并有重点地分别催缴。由于这种种努力，上海公营企业纳税工作才获得了上述成绩。
    【新华社天津二日电】天津市公营企业一九四九年工商税及一九五○年一、二月份营业税的征收工作已经基本完成。截至三月底止，两项税款已入库者共合小米三千五百四十四万五千余斤。天津市应纳一九四九年工商税的一百八十八个公营企业单位（包括外地驻津的十个单位在内）中，除二十三户虽已申报但因所得额无法计算或申报材料不全等原因一时未能核税，还有一单位尚未申报外，其余均已申报并核税，且大部已缴款。应纳一九五○年一、二月份营业税之公营企业单位共一百九十三个，已全部完成申报手续；其中一百八十九户已经核税，一百七十六单位税款已缴库。现天津市税局对少数未能按时缴库之单位，将严格执行政务院法令，按日加罚滞纳金。
    津市公营企业一九四九年工商税的申报工作原于二月四日开始。当时部分企业因其各直属上级对纳税未能及时作出决定，同时有些干部对国家税收认识不足，以致发生拖延、迟迟不报等现象，影响了税收工作的进行。自三月十四日中央人民政府各企业主管部门联席会议决定了公营企业纳税办法后，公营企业纳税的主要难关即被打破，个别拖延观望者也失去借口，加以市税务局耐心进行宣传动员工作，并分派干部到各企业催促，帮助厂户解决具体困难，因而申报工作便很快展开。如全国总工会所属的“五一”生产社，曾认为该社账目难算，不好申报，税务局干部当即帮助它结算，解决该企业的困难。在申报中，有些单位表现很好，例如华北煤铁公司申报很早，并耐心地向税收工作人员解释了该公司的会计科目及会计制度，便利了税局的核税工作。
