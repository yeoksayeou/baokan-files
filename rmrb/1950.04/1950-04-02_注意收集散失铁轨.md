　　Notice: Collect Scattered Rails
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a worker in this city. During the Lunar New Year, I returned to my hometown (Shulu County). I saw some rails lying around in villages relatively far from the railway. I think these are state property and should be reported to the relevant departments for collection; otherwise, they will rust if left for too long. The ones I saw this time are not yet damaged and were manufactured by Hanyang. Even if they are not suitable for current use, they can be collected and used for other purposes. In the past, the People's Government also carried out work to collect railway materials, but it has not yet completed the collection of these scattered rails.
                                                 Jǐng Shān
    Editor's Note: Comrade Jǐng Shān's suggestion demonstrates his spirit of cherishing state property. We hope he can write directly to the Ministry of Railways with the detailed address where the rails are stored and the quantity of rails.

### 注意收集散失铁轨

　　注意收集散失铁轨编辑同志：
    我是本市一个工人，旧历新年我回了一趟老家（束鹿县），我看见离铁路较远的乡村中，还放着一些铁轨。我想这是国家财产，应当通知有关部门，将它收集起来；不然放的时间久了，也就锈坏了。我这次见到的还没有坏，是汉阳造的，如不适合现在用，也可收来作别的用。以前人民政府也做过收集铁路器材的工作，但是还没将这些遗散的路轨收集完。
                                                 景山
    编者按：景山同志提出这个意见，表现了他爱护国家财产的精神。我们希望他能把存放铁轨的详细地址和铁轨数量，直接写信告诉铁道部。
