汴 City Tax Bureau Re-audits Accounts
Proving Merchants' Burden Is Not Heavy

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Henan Daily on April 8th: The Kaifeng City Tax Bureau conducted another general audit from March 23rd to 28th, and continued to discover a large number of false accounts. The city sent 36 cadres in early March for a focused surprise inspection, finding that 80% of the inspected merchants had false accounts. This time, among the 75 households in 18 businesses inspected, 39 households even defied and refused to submit or dared not submit their account books, insisting that they had no books; 36 households only had this year's account books and could not submit last year's; or only had part of last year's accounts, lacking capital accounts or inventory accounts, etc. According to statistics, 88.6% of all account books checked this time were completely false, and 11.4% were relatively true. Among these false accounts, the highest tax burden accounted for 26.6% of their turnover, and the lowest accounted for 0.71%; in the relatively true account books, the highest tax burden accounted for 1.97% of their turnover, and the lowest accounted for 1.28%. And the tax burden of some merchants who did not submit their account books, calculated based on their self-reported business volume, was not considered heavy either. For example, Zhou Jianzhong, manager of the Lu Yongyuan general merchandise store, said, "I can sell an average of 60,000 yuan per day, and more than 1.8 million yuan per month." Even based on this figure, compared with the amount of industrial and commercial tax borne by the store last winter (143 jin of wheat), it only accounts for about 3.4%. According to Liu Dacheng of the general merchandise business: "Before the new year, in the best months, I could sell 40,000 yuan per day, and generally more than 20,000 yuan per day." Thus, compared with his burden of 22 jin of wheat, it only accounts for about 1.9% of his turnover. Through this audit, it was once again proved that the city's industrial and commercial tax cannot be considered heavy.

　　汴市税务局再次查账
    证明商户负担并不重
    【本报讯】据四月八日河南日报消息：开封市税务局上月二十三日至二十八日，又进行了一次普遍查账，继续发见大批不实账目。该市曾于三月初派干部三十六名，作过一次重点突击检查，发现百分之八十的被检查商户是有假账的。这次，在检查的十八业七十五户中，有三十九户甚至竟违抗不交或不敢交出账本，而硬说没账；有三十六户只有今年的账簿，交不出去年的账簿；或者只有一部分去年的账目，而缺少资金账或盘货账等。据统计：此次查到的所有账簿中，百分之八十八点六是完全假的，百分之十一点四是比较真实的。在这些假账中间，负担额最高者占其营业额的百分之二十六点六，最低者占百分之零点七一；比较真实的账簿，负担额最高者占其营业额的百分之一点九七，最低者占百分之一点二八。而一部分没有交出账簿的商户，根据他们自报的营业数额计算，也不算重。如百货业卢永元号经理周建中说：“我每天平均可卖六万元，每月可卖一百八十多万元。”纵使根据这一数字，与该号去年冬季负担的工商税额（一百四十三斤小麦）相比较，也约占百分之三点四。另据百货业刘大成说：“年前，顶好的月份，每天我能卖四万元，一般的每天卖两万多元。”这样，如与他二十二斤小麦的负担额相比，也不过占其营业额的百分之一点九左右。通过这一次查账，又一次的证明了该市的工商税是不能算重的。
