Learning Role Model Chen Shibin
    By Our Correspondent Bai Yuan

    Chen Shibin, a learning role model, is a well-known figure in a certain division of the North China People's Liberation Army. He is twenty-six years old this year. When he was twenty-three years old in the autumn, he was captured by the Kuomintang in his hometown of Sichuan and served as an "unjust soldier" for more than a year. During the liberation of Beijing, he was also liberated and joined the People's Liberation Army. According to the soldiers in the army who have worked with him, Chen Shibin always buries himself in his work without saying anything. But when you talk to him, he can talk with great interest. He is a very interesting person. However, this is only the case after joining the People's Liberation Army. According to himself, he used to be a grumpy person who would quarrel and fight with people at the slightest provocation. When he was a soldier in the Kuomintang army, he had fought with soldiers and squad leaders. Before being captured by the Kuomintang, he had worked as a laborer in Chongqing, chiseling stones for others, learning opera in opera troupes, learning to roll cigarettes, and later became a mason. He said, "At that time, I often thought, a person who lives, a worker can only do work, a stone chiseler can only chisel stones, how boring. At that time, I wanted to learn everything. But at that time, learning anything was unsuccessful. When I went to the opera troupe to learn opera, because I was illiterate, I couldn't learn anything else, they just told me to take a wooden stick and tie my legs straight, sit there, and touch my toes with my head back and forth. After learning like this for three months, I didn't want to do it anymore."
    "When I was in the Kuomintang army, it was even more of a mess. I received slave education all day long and lived a life of cattle and horses. The officers forced everyone to drill on the playground with sticks. After that, they didn't do anything. After paying the salaries, the officers gambled with the soldiers. Once, I don't know what good luck it was, but I won all the money of a battalion. The officers saw that I had won so much money and were afraid that I would run away, so they pulled me to play cards with them every day. During that time, I didn't even have to stand guard. I just played cards with them all day long, until I lost all the money to them."
    Chen Shibin's past life in the old society was the same as that of thousands upon thousands of poor people who had lived in the old society. Every day was full of bullying and humiliation. He is from Wudang County, Sichuan Province. His family had no land or house, and their poor life was really miserable. He followed his parents to beg for food from a young age and lived in a stone cave at night. When he was nine years old, his parents both suffered from heatstroke. He led his seven-year-old brother to beg for food and brought it back for his sick parents to eat. Because they had no money to buy medicine to treat the disease, and the stone cave was damp and cold, his mother died in the stone cave. From then on, he and his brother went out to beg for food every day to support their sick father. Because they were young, the watchdogs of the rich often knocked them to the ground. Even now, he still has several scars on his legs from dog bites. He begged for food until he was sixteen years old, and then he went to Chongqing to sell his labor for a living, but he still couldn't escape the filthy hands of the Kuomintang bandits.
    When he first came to the People's Liberation Army from the Kuomintang army, he only knew his name and a few simple numbers. After the battle of Taiyuan, the troops moved into a relatively stable environment. Last June, they were stationed in Xinmazhuang, Yanggao County, Shanxi. The troops began to call on the soldiers to conduct regular learning. At that time, they were learning the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Chen Shibin had not yet made up his mind to learn at that time. The study group leader asked him to learn one word every day, but he often couldn't learn even one word. Later, the learning craze in the entire army became higher and higher every day, and everyone was learning. Chen Shibin thought: I can't fall behind others. From July, the troops transferred their station, and he slowly began to learn automatically. By August, the troops began training. During the training period, due to Chen Shibin's progress in learning, he received a reward in the army, and the leaders of the troops invited him to eat together. At this time, he remembered that when he first came to the People's Liberation Army from the Kuomintang army, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army asked him how many characters he knew. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army said that if he could recognize a thousand characters, he could be transferred to the Propaganda Department to work. From then on, he realized the relationship between superiors and subordinates and the working relationship in the revolutionary ranks. All systems and divisions of labor are determined by the needs of the work and the abilities of each individual. There is no personal oppression and humiliation here, and the level of work position does not limit personal development. From then on, he made the greatest determination. During the training period, he set a learning plan of recognizing five characters a day. As a result, he was able to recognize ten characters every day and could recognize, write, and use them. In just a few months, he has become a revolutionary fighter who can recognize more than 2,000 characters and understands culture, and is already able to write fairly detailed family letters and diaries.
    Regarding his learning methods and experience, he said: "When learning, one is to learn according to the textbook, and the other is to learn outside the textbook. The textbook has a certain number of characters every day. Today you learn this lesson, tomorrow you learn that lesson, it won't be chaotic. But a person has to do many things every day, and the characters in the textbook can't keep up with the things a person does. If you need to use them on the same day, the textbook doesn't have them; sometimes the textbook has characters, but you don't do those things on the same day, so you can't use them, and if you can't use them, you easily forget them." In a notebook he started using last July, he recorded the number of buckets of water he carried for the people every day, such as how many buckets of water he carried on the 11th, how many buckets of water he carried on the 12th, how many buckets of water he carried on the 13th, etc. Almost half of the entire notebook was filled with these characters. In addition, if the kitchen eats radishes today, he learns the two characters for radish. If the troops watch a play today, he learns the two characters for watching a play. According to Chen Shibin's experience, it is very fast to learn characters by connecting them with one's own life; it is very slow to learn if people give you a few characters every day. Besides these, he said: The main thing in learning is to concentrate, "You can't learn with your hands alone, you can't learn without your heart." He said that once he was learning the character "歪" (crooked), he always thought of "不" (not) at the bottom of "正" (straight). He even asked people in his dreams whether the character "歪" was "不" at the bottom of "正". He asked people when he woke up, and from then on, he remembered this character. He also said: "When I was in Xinmazhuang, I couldn't learn a single character because I didn't want to learn at that time." He wrote on several of his notebooks: "You must concentrate on learning to achieve results." Finally, according to Chen Shibin's opinion, learning needs to have a certain amount of time. Sometimes the troops are too busy, and he learns many characters before going to bed at night or when he is lying in bed and hasn't fallen asleep yet. He hopes that the troops will pay attention not to cancel the learning time when carrying out production.
    When talking about his learning process, he will tell you many interesting things. When he started learning, he didn't have a fountain pen, so he bought a brush to learn. Because he used to smoke, brushes were cheap, and he could save some money to smoke by buying brushes. Later, several brushes were worn out, and he had to buy a fountain pen, so he decided to quit smoking and used his allowance for two or three months to buy a fountain pen. After a while, he thought: In the past, because my family was too poor, I couldn't afford to go to school. Now that I'm in the People's Liberation Army, I don't have to spend money, and I've gone to school and learned to read. It's nothing to spend a little money to buy cigarettes and smoke. At the same time, smoking a little cigarette can clear my mind, and it's good for learning! So he started smoking again. He said with a smile: "This idea is of course wrong. In fact, I haven't quit smoking yet, but now I smoke much less than before!"
    Last year, after his hometown of Sichuan was liberated, he immediately wrote two letters home in succession, particularly happily describing his learning situation in the People's Liberation Army, and told his family: "I have also learned to write letters!" After his hometown was liberated, he was particularly concerned about his younger brother who begged for food with him when he was a child. In his letter, he instructed his younger brother to hurry up and learn and recognize characters. He also wrote in his letter: "I have now decided to learn to be both civil and military, and be a good revolutionary fighter until there is no war in the world..." This is the entire thought of the learning role model Chen Shibin, the thought of a model revolutionary fighter. (Attached photo)

　　学习模范陈世彬
    本报记者  白原
    学习模范陈世彬，在华北人民解放军某师中是一位很有名的人物。今年二十六岁。他二十三岁那年秋天，在家乡四川被国民党抓去当了一年多的“冤兵”。在北京解放的时候，他也获得了解放，并参加了人民解放军。听部队里和他在一起工作过的战士说，陈世彬在作工作的时候，总是埋头苦干，什么话也不说。和他谈起话来，他却能说得津津有味。他是一个很有趣味的人。不过这只是到了解放军中以后的情形。据他自己说，他从前是一个性子暴躁的人，动不动就和人家吵打起来，在国民党军队中当兵的那时候，和士兵、班长都打过架。未被国民党抓去当兵以前，他在重庆给人家当过苦工，替人家凿石头，到戏班里学过戏，学过卷烟，后来又做了泥水匠。他说：“那个时候，我常想，一个人活着，做工的就只会做工，凿石头的就只会凿石头，多没意思。那时候我什么都想学。但是在那个时候，学什么也不成。到戏班里学戏，因为不识字，不能学别的，只叫我拿一根木棍，把腿捆得直直的，坐在那里，把头来回的碰在脚尖上。这样学了三个月，我就不愿干了。”
    “在国民党军队里的时候，更是草蛋，一天到晚受的奴才教育，过的牛马生活。长官拿着棍子迫着大家在操场上操练，下来什么也不干，关了饷长官们就和士兵在一块赌博。有一次，也不知道是什么好运气，一营人的钱都叫我赢了。长官们看见我赢了这许多钱，怕我逃跑，就天天拉着我和他们在一块打牌。那一阵子连岗也不用我站，一天到晚就是陪他们打牌，一直到我把那许多钱都输给他们为止。”
    陈世彬过去在旧社会生活的历史，就和千千万万曾经在旧社会里生活过的穷苦人一样，每一个日子都充满了欺侮和凌辱。他是四川武当县人，家中没地没房，穷日子过得真凄惨；从小跟着爹娘讨饭，晚上住在一个石洞里；九岁那年，爹娘都害了热病。他领着七岁的弟弟去讨饭，回来给害病的爹娘吃。因为没钱买药治病，石洞里又湿又冷，娘就死在石洞里。从此，他就和弟弟每天出去讨饭养活着多病的父亲；两人年岁小，有钱人的把门狗常常把他们扑倒在地上。到现在他腿上还留着几块被狗咬伤的疤痕。讨饭一直讨到十六岁，他就到重庆出卖劳力谋生，结果还是逃不掉国民党匪盗们龌龊的手掌。
    从国民党军队刚到解放军来的时候，他只认得自己的名字和几个简单的数目字。打太原下来以后，部队转入了比较安定的环境。去年六月，他们驻在山西阳高县的新马庄。部队里开始号召战士们进行正规的学习。那时候他们学的是三大纪律八项注意。陈世彬当时还没有下决心学习。学习组长叫他每天学一个字，但他常常一个字也学不会。后来整个部队的学习热潮一天比一天高涨，每一个人都在进行学习。陈世彬想：不能落在别人的后头。从七月开始，部队转移了驻地，他就慢慢自动的学习起来。到八月，部队开始练兵。在练兵期间，由于陈世彬在学习上的进步，在部队里获得了奖励，部队首长请他在一块吃饭。这时候，他又想起从国民党军队刚到解放军的时候，解放军的工作同志问他识多少字。解放军的工作同志说，如果能识一千字就可以调到宣传部去工作。从此，他认识了革命队伍中的上下关系以及工作关系。一切制度和分工都是由工作的需要和各人的能力所决定。这里没有个人的压迫与奴辱，这里工作职务的高低并不限制个人的发展。从此他就下了最大的决心，在练兵期间，他订下了一天识五个字的学习计划，结果每天能够识到十个字，并且会认、会写、会用。在短短几个月中，他已经成了一个能识两千多字的、懂得文化的革命战士，并已能够写出相当详尽的家信和日记。
    关于他的学习方法和学习经验，他说：“学的时候，一个是照课本学，一个是在课本以外学。课本每天有一定的字，今天学这课，明天学那课，不会乱。但一个人每天要做许多的事情，课本里的字就赶不上人做的事情，当天要用，课本里没有；有时候课本有的字，当天没有做那些事，就用不上，用不上就容易忘。”在他去年七月开始学习时的一个学习本子上，每天记着他替老百姓担水的数字，如十一日担水多少担，十二日担水多少担，十三日担水多少担等等，差不多整个本子的一半都写满了这几个字。此外，今天厨房里吃萝卜就学萝卜两字，今天部队看戏就学看戏两字。根据陈世彬的经验，联系自己的生活去学字，是学得很快的；人家每天给你出几个字，这样去学就很不快。除了以上这些，他说：学习主要的还是靠专心，“光手学不会，非心学不成。”他说他有一次学一个“歪”字，他老是想着“不”字底下一个“正”字，晚上做梦也问人家“歪”字是不是“不”字底下一个“正”字，醒来也问人家，从此这个字就记住了。他又说：“在新马庄时我一个字也学不会，就因为我那时还不想学。”他在他的好几个学习本子上都写着：“要专心学习才有成绩。”最后，根据陈世彬的意见，学习需要有一定的时间，部队里有时候太忙，他有很多字都是在晚上睡觉以前或躺在床上还未睡着的时候学的。他希望部队在进行生产的时候，注意不要取消学习的时间。
    谈起他的学习的经过，他会对你说出许多很有趣味的事情。开始学习的时候没有钢笔，就买毛笔来学。因为他原来就会吸烟，毛笔便宜，买毛笔还可留些钱来吸烟。后来几枝毛笔都写坏了，不得不买钢笔了，他就决心戒烟，把两三个月的津贴费拿来买了钢笔。过了一个时候，他想：过去因为家里太穷，念不起书，现在到了解放军里，不用花钱，也念了书，识了字，花一点钱买买烟吸，算不了什么，同时吸一点烟清清脑筋，对学习还有好处呢！所以又吸起烟来。他笑着说：“这个思想当然是不对头的，其实是烟瘾还没有戒掉，不过现在比从前少吸得多了！”
    去年他的家乡四川解放以后，他立即接连写了两封信回家，特别高兴的叙述了他在解放军中学习的情形，并且对他家里的人说：“我也学会写信了！”家乡解放以后，他特别关心着小时候和他一起讨饭的弟弟，在他的信里嘱咐他的弟弟赶快学习、认字。他还在信里写着：“我现在决定要学得文武双全，好好当一个革命战士，一直到世界上没有战争……”这也就是学习模范陈世彬的整个思想，一个模范的革命战士的思想。（附图片）
