　　Xiayuan Power Plant Boiler Department Breaks Coal Consumption Quota Standard
    One and a Half Months Save 186 Metric Tons of Coal
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The workers of the Boiler Department of the Xiayuan Power Plant in Chahar Province, in order to reduce coal consumption (that is, the amount of coal consumed per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated) and lower power generation costs, have worked hard to improve technology. The average coal consumption in February has been reduced to 0.787 kilograms, breaking the standard quota of 0.83 kilograms set by the Central Fuel Industry Department. In the first half of March, the average coal consumption continued to drop to 0.753 kilograms. In one and a half months, a total of 186 metric tons of coal were saved compared to the standard quota, thus relatively reducing power generation costs. Since the implementation of quota management, under the leadership of foreman Zhang Yongjing, the Boiler Department, after everyone's discussion, first reviewed that the past use of fire hooks to stir the fire affected the uneven thickness of the coal layer, and some coal was lost due to incomplete combustion; in addition, the blast was large and the induced draft was small, causing fire to escape from the fire window. After improving the fire stirring technique and adjusting the wind pressure, the average coal consumption in February was reduced to 0.787 kilograms, saving 0.045 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour compared to January. Following foreman Zhang Yongjing's suggestion, the department made use of all the machine's ancillary equipment, giving full play to the efficiency of all the machinery. In the first half of March, the average coal consumption was further reduced to 0.753 kilograms, further reducing the cost of power generation. Currently, all departments of the plant are launching reasonable suggestion campaigns to improve technology and reduce costs to ensure the realization of quota management.

　　下花园发电厂锅炉部突破煤耗定额标准
    一个半月省煤一八六公吨
    【本报讯】察省下花园发电厂锅炉部职工为减低煤耗（即每发一度电所耗煤量），降低发电成本，努力改进技术，二月份平均煤耗已降为○·七八七公斤，突破中央燃料工业部所规定之定额○·八三公斤的标准。三月上半月平均煤耗又继续下降为○·七五三公斤。一个半月总计较定额标准节省煤一八六公吨，因而发电成本相对降低。该厂自实行定额管理后，锅炉部在领班张永敬的领导下，经过大家的讨论，首先检讨出过去用火钩拨火，影响煤层厚薄不均，有一部分煤因燃烧不完而受损失；加之鼓风大，引风小，从火窗中向外冒火。经过改进拨火技术，调整风压后，二月份平均煤耗降为○·七八七公斤，每度电较一月份可省煤○·○四五公斤。继又经领班张永敬的建议，利用机器所有附属设备，发挥了全部机械的效率，三月上半月平均煤耗又降为○·七五三公斤，进一步降低了发电的成本。现全厂各部门正为改进技术，降低成本，开展合理的建议运动，以保证定额管理的实现。
