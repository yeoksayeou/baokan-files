　　Shen County Farm Promotes Superior Varieties
    Plans to Complete the Replacement of Huanong No. 4 Millet and Shengli No. 100 Sweet Potato Planting Within Three Years
    [Our Newspaper News] In order to complete the task of universally replacing superior varieties within five years ahead of schedule, the Shen County Farm in Hebei Province, based on the farmers' planting habits and soil conditions, focuses on cultivating model heroes, and vigorously promotes and propagates through them and organizations such as the Production Committee. It is planned to complete the task of replacing superior varieties such as Huanong No. 4 millet and Shengli No. 100 sweet potato within three years. Currently, 136 agricultural technology research groups (headed by experienced farmers) have been established in 436 administrative villages throughout the county, and 65 models (including 5 women) have been identified. On the basis of this year's village elections, the leadership of the Production Committee has been strengthened. The minimum requirement is to establish one agricultural technology research group in each village, cultivate one production model in each village, and have one labor hero in each district. The county has also identified seven promotion zones: Zone 1, Dajia Village, is a superior seed preservation zone. With Ma Xingyun as the core, in conjunction with the Production Committee and the Technology Research Group, a superior variety management committee has been established to organize 20 households to plant 43 mu of Si-character No. 4 cotton for preservation. Zone 4, Dechao Village, is a promotion zone for Shengli No. 100 and Nonglin No. 4 sweet potatoes. Last year, the village promoted 10,000 seedlings. This year, 11 households have dug 26 yam cellars, and the farm also has 20, for a total of 46 cellars. Each cellar yields an average of about 10,000 seedlings. At 2,500 seedlings per mu, at least 180 mu need to be planted. Zone 8, Gao Lianfang in Gaojiazhuang, and Gao Guandou, a labor hero in Zone 6, are promotion and propagation zones for Huanong No. 4 and 811 millet, and Huanong No. 5 wheat. Zone 10, Huajiawa, is a Huanong No. 4 preservation zone led personally by farm cadres. In five nearby villages, a ten-qing plot of land for planting Huanong No. 4 millet has been fertilized and harrowed. The farm brought ten jin of mercury agent and a seed mixing device, and after mixing the millet seeds, they have been distributed to each household. In each preservation zone (except for the promotion zone), all those who plant cotton and Huanong No. 4 millet are persuaded and replaced with the same seeds through individual mobilization by experienced farmers. In order to dispel the masses' planting concerns, the seeds treated with mercury agent in the Huajiawa preservation zone are provided free of charge by the farm. In the promotion and planting, a slogan of "seven comparisons" is proposed: compare with local millet seeds and cotton seeds in terms of plants, ears, piles, yield, and color. This is to use practical examples to dispel the masses' concerns and lay the foundation for future comprehensive promotion.

    In addition to the above promotion zones, there are also three promotion stations (without leading villages) such as Cuijiazhuang, Xiputuan, and Qiaoliuxinzhuang, and seven villages led by the farm nearby. There are a total of 39 promotion leading villages in the county. Currently, the farm has 17,000 jin of Huanong No. 4 millet, 2,200 jin of 811 millet, more than 1,600 jin of Zihonggen millet, 1,000 jin of Huanong No. 5 wheat, and 500 jin of No. 72 wheat, which can be planted on 150 mu (calculated at 10 jin per mu). The farm also has 420 jin of Si-character B and No. 4 cotton seeds, which can be planted on 40 mu (calculated at 8 jin per mu). Using only Huanong No. 4 millet, calculated at 3 jin per mu, 5,666 mu can be planted this year, and Huanong No. 4 millet can be replaced throughout the county within two years. Within three years, Huanong No. 4 millet, Shengli No. 100, and Nonglin No. 4 sweet potatoes will be universally planted throughout the county. Si-character cotton still needs the support of the Cotton Production Improvement Office to complete the task of replacing superior varieties ahead of schedule.

    Now, many farmers come to the farm every day to exchange seeds. Shi Fengxiao from Haozhuang in Zone 9, who lives 60 li away from the farm, pushes a small cart to exchange cotton and millet seeds. Cui Laoquan, a labor model from Cuijiazhuang in Zone 3, led 164 households to exchange cotton seeds. The practical benefits of promoting and propagating superior varieties last year are educating farmers to begin to understand the adoption of superior varieties.

　　深县农场推广优良品种
    计划在三年内完成改换华农四号谷、胜利百号甘薯的种植
    【本报讯】为了提前完成五年内普换优良品种任务，河北省深县农场，根据农民的种植习惯、土质情况，有重点培养英雄模范，通过他们与生产委员会等组织，大力进行推广繁殖。计划在三年内，完成改换华农四号谷，胜利百号甘薯等优良品种的任务。现全县四三六个行政村，已建立了一三六个农业技术研究组（由老农担任组长），已发现六五个模范（妇女五人），并在今年村选的基础上，健全生产委员会的领导。最低要求每村建立一个农业技术研究组，每村培养一个生产模范，每区有一个劳动英雄。全县并确定了七个推广区：一区大贾村为优种保纯区。以马行云为核心，结合生产委员会和技术研究组，建立优良品种保管委员会，组织二十户种四十三亩斯字四号棉保纯。四区德朝村为胜利百号与农林四号甘薯推广区。去年该村推广了一万棵，今年由十一户群众，盘了二十六个山药洞，农场里还有二十个，共四十六个洞，每洞平均约出一万棵秧子，每亩按二千五百棵计算，最少要种一百八十亩。八区高家庄高连芳，和六区劳动英雄高贯斗是推广繁殖华农四号、八一一谷、华农五号小麦区。十区槐家洼是农场干部亲自下手领导的华农四号保纯区，在附近五个村，已将一块十顷种华农四号谷的地，施肥打耙好。由农场带去了十斤涂抹水银剂，拌种器一个，将谷种拌好后已分发到各户。在各个保纯区内（推广区除外），凡是种棉花和华农四号谷子的都是通过老农个别动员说服调换成同一样的种子。为了打破群众的种植顾虑，槐家洼保纯区内，用水银制剂拌的种子，不要钱由农场负责。在推广种植中，并提出与本地谷种棉花种比棵、比穗、比堆、比产量、比成色等七比口号。以便用实际例子来打破群众的顾虑，打下今后全面推广的基础。
    除上述推广区外，还有崔家庄、西蒲疃、乔刘辛庄等三个推广站（无带动村的叫站）和农场附近带动的七个村，全县共有三十九个推广带动村。现在农场有华农四号谷一万七千斤，八一一谷二千二百斤，紫红根谷一千六百多斤，华农五号小麦一千斤，七十二号小麦五百斤，可种一百五十亩（按每亩十斤计）。农场还存斯字Ｂ、四号棉籽四百二十斤，可种四十亩（按八斤一亩计）。仅以华农四号谷按三斤一亩计算，今年可种五、六六六亩，二年内就可使全县都换成华农四号谷。在三年内，华农四号谷，胜利百号，农林四号甘薯，足能普遍全县各地。斯字棉还需在棉产改进处的扶植下，才能提前完成改换优良品种的任务。
    现在农场里每天都有不少农民来换种籽，九区郝庄石凤霄，离农场六十里地推着小车去换棉谷种。三区崔家庄劳动模范崔老权带动了一百六十四户换了棉种。去年推广繁殖优良品种的实际好处教育着农民开始懂得优良品种的采用。（深县县委通讯干事耿彦龄）
