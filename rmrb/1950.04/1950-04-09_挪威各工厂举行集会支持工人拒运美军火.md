Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, April 5th: A wave of protests against the expected arrival of American military supplies is surging in Norway. Factories in various towns have held rallies to support Oslo dockworkers' refusal to accept the call from the right-wing leadership of the port workers' union to unload American military supplies. Many leaflets issued by the Norwegian branch of the Women's International Democratic Federation are being widely distributed in the port of Oslo. In the leaflets, Norwegian women thank the Oslo dockworkers for their decision not to unload war materials, and state, "Stand firm! Defend peace! Guarantee peace for our country!" Workers at the Scarpo car factory held a general meeting in Oslo on the 4th, endorsing the decision of the Oslo dockworkers and pledging to support them. Workers in Skien also made the same statement. In a letter to the Oslo dockworkers, they stated: We are delighted to learn of your decision not to unload American military supplies and fully support your initiative.
