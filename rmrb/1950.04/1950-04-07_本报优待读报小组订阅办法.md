This Newspaper's Preferential Subscription Method for Reading Groups

    To encourage readers across the country to read this newspaper in an organized manner, and to strengthen the connection between this newspaper and its readers, we hereby stipulate the following preferential measures for reading groups subscribing to this newspaper:

    1. Readers across the country, who form reading groups of three or more people to subscribe to this newspaper for one month or more, will enjoy a 30% discount. Readers who have already subscribed to this newspaper but whose subscription has not yet expired, if they now form a reading group and are willing to continue subscribing to this newspaper, will receive a free monthly table of contents for the unexpired portion of their subscription; from the second month onwards, they will receive a 30% discount. Any excess prepaid subscription fees will be credited towards future subscription fees.

    2. When subscribing, the above-mentioned reading groups must hold a letter of proof from an organization. Workers must be certified by the labor union, farmers by the farmers' association, soldiers by the political organ above the company level, students and faculty by the student union or school labor union, staff of various organs by their respective service organ, and people of other social strata by their affiliated mass organizations. Reading groups requesting preferential treatment must provide a detailed list of the group, including the name, age, gender, occupation, and mailing address of each member. Such requests for preferential treatment can be directly submitted to the local post office, and upon verification by the post office or this newspaper, the 30% discount can be applied.

    3. The secretariat of this newspaper will maintain contact with the reading groups enjoying the above-mentioned preferential treatment. Each reading group should send a letter at least once a month reflecting the opinions and requests of the group or other readers regarding this newspaper. The letters can be of any length and should be sent directly to the secretariat of this newspaper. Please cut off the upper left corner of the letter and write "Reader Opinions" on the upper right corner, and submit it directly to the post office. The postage will be paid by this newspaper to the post office. If a reading group fails to provide feedback for two consecutive months, its preferential rights will be revoked.

    4. If anyone falsely claims to be a reading group to subscribe to this newspaper, once discovered, the preferential treatment will be immediately terminated, and the original subscription fee must be supplemented.

    5. These measures will be implemented from April 7, 1950. Any amendments will be announced in the newspaper separately.
