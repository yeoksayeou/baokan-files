Beware, Corrupt Officials!
    Taiyuan Railway Bureau Dismisses Li Riren
    [Our Dispatch] Li Riren, a clerk at the Taiyuan Second Sales Department of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Employee Supply Cooperative, was habitually passive in his work, arrogant and complacent, and given to making strange remarks. Despite repeated education by the department's leadership, he remained unrepentant. Moreover, he abused his authority to embezzle and steal 144 jin of flour from the department's warehouse. After this was discovered, the bureau not only ordered him to return all the flour but also intends to give him a dismissal punishment. (Jing Guang)
