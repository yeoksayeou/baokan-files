Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 24th: A donation campaign by employed workers in Shanghai to aid their unemployed brothers has been widely launched in various factories and institutions. Emergency relief work for the most impoverished unemployed workers and their families has already begun.

　　Workers' unions of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union, including the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the French Electric Power Company branches, have voluntarily donated one day's wages. Over 90% of the city's more than 4,000 postal workers have participated in the donation. Members of the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union, including the Huashun, Puxi Gonghexing, Pudong Gonghexing, and Zhongxing branches, donated one day's wages on the 18th. Although the majority of members of the Handicraft Workers' Union are unemployed, those who still have work have unanimously expressed their intention to complete the glorious task of helping their unemployed brothers by the end of April. Workers and staff in public and private hospitals throughout the city, under the leadership of the Medical Workers' Union, are expanding the donation campaign to various units. Other employed workers in industries such as hardware, printing, flour, food, and military industries are also universally launching the donation of one day's wages. In terms of government unions, workers in the Public Works Bureau have initiated a donation campaign. Employees of the People's Court, under the call of the union, have donated 950,000 yuan in cash and 200 real value units.

　　To quickly solve the livelihood problems of the most impoverished unemployed workers and their families, emergency relief work has begun. The Textile Workers' Union and the Dockworkers' Union have successively borrowed a batch of rice from the Labor Insurance Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and have dispatched cadres together with representatives of employed workers from various factories to form condolence teams and investigation groups to distribute emergency relief grain to the homes of unemployed workers in the Xinsheng Spinning Mill and various docks. The workers who received emergency relief were deeply moved by the care and help of their employed worker brothers.
