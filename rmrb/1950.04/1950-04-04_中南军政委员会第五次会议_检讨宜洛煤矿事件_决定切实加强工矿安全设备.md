Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: The Central and Southern Military and Political Committee held its fifth routine administrative meeting on the 29th of last month. Twenty-eight people attended, including heads of various committees, ministries, departments, bureaus, and banks. The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Deng Zihui. The main content was a strict review of the gas explosion incident at the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan Province, and five measures for handling the matter were adopted.

　　At the meeting, Zhu Yi, Minister of the Heavy Industry Department of the Central and Southern District, first reported on the causes, process, and aftermath of the major gas explosion incident at the Yiluo Coal Mine. The incident occurred on February 27th, with the area affected by the explosion reaching 10,600 square meters, accounting for about one-third of the entire underground area. Approximately one-third of the roadways in the explosion area collapsed, and 146 workers have been confirmed dead. This caused serious losses to the lives of workers and state property. According to preliminary investigations and analysis, the accident was caused by the historically high methane content in the mine, combined with the use of primitive mining methods, lack of ventilation equipment, few wellheads, extremely weak airflow, and air leakage. Although workers had mentioned these issues several times, they did not attract the attention of the mine's administrative leaders and responsible engineering personnel, and no efforts were made to rectify the situation, leading to increased heat and methane accumulation. In addition, the mine had no system for underground inspections, and many people smoked underground. Of the four bodies transported from the mine on March 7th, all had red-headed matches and cigarettes on their persons. The incident was likely caused by smoking and striking a match. The mine's roadway engineering was also extremely weak, and the explosion caused multiple collapses of the support structures, thus increasing the number of deaths and injuries.

　　The above situation arose because the mine had no safety regulations, no labor discipline, and an extremely unsound work and inspection system. There was a serious lack of unity among employees, with a serious lack of government and discipline. The specific causes and detailed circumstances are still under investigation. The occurrence of this incident has aroused great attention from the Central People's Government, the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, and the Henan Provincial People's Government, which immediately allocated funds and sent personnel to investigate and handle the aftermath and relief matters. The Preparatory Committee of the Central and Southern Region Federation of Trade Unions and the Heavy Industry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee both sent people with funds to express condolences to the families of the deceased workers. After emergency rescue efforts, 24 of the 27 seriously injured workers have been taken out of danger. Currently, under the leadership of the administrative organs and the trade union, the mine workers are transforming grief into strength, quickly burying the bodies, and carrying out repairs in order to resume production as soon as possible. Minister Zhu said in his review: The Central Government had long decided that the Yiluo Coal Mine should be taken over by the Heavy Industry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, but the department had been slow to accept it. During the period when it was temporarily under the direct leadership of the Henan Provincial People's Government, leadership over the province's factories and mines was not strengthened. Therefore, the department must bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of this incident, and he requested that the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee impose a penalty.

　　Subsequently, Li Yiqing, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, and Qian Ying, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Committee, also made self-criticisms. Deputy Director Li reviewed that the committee had not fully implemented the spirit of the various meetings of the Central Government, and that systemic reforms of public enterprises had not been carried out, resulting in the continued existence of quite serious unreasonable phenomena in the Yiluo Coal Mine, leading to this consequence, and he requested punishment. Deputy Director Qian said that after the incident occurred, the Central Supervisory Committee had sent personnel to investigate, but the Central and Southern District Supervisory Committee had not paid enough attention to it and should conduct a deep self-criticism.

　　Vice Chairman Deng concluded with a speech, painfully pointing out that the explosion at the Yiluo Coal Mine had resulted in the deaths and injuries of more than 100 workers, which was a serious tragedy. Vice Chairman Deng emphasized that the Kuomintang reactionary government had always treated human lives as expendable, and was even more indifferent to the deaths and injuries of working people. However, the People's Government should be responsible for the lives and property of the people, first and foremost for the lives of the people, especially the lives of the working people. We should resolutely oppose the attitude of joking with the lives of the working people. Therefore, Vice Chairman Deng proposed: (1) First approve the expenses paid by the Henan Provincial People's Government for the burial, treatment, compensation, and advance payment of wages to relieve the families of the Yiluo dead and injured workers, which will be reimbursed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee. (2) Thoroughly inspect the safety equipment of the Yiluo Coal Mine, and do not rush to start work until safety is guaranteed. (3) Immediately issue a circular to all factories and mines in the Central and Southern region, and send personnel from the Heavy Industry Department to investigate, and, in accordance with repeated instructions from the Central Government, thoroughly inspect safety equipment to ensure the safety of workers. Any equipment that does not meet safety standards should be immediately modified or even shut down to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. (4) Order the provincial and county governments and military organs to immediately send armed protection to local factories and mines threatened by bandits and special agents, and step up the elimination of bandits and special agents to ensure the safety of factories and mines. (5) Regarding the investigation of responsibility for the Yiluo incident, in addition to the responsible persons of the Yiluo factory and mine and the Henan Industry and Commerce Department who have been decided to be punished, it is recommended that the Central People's Government give the Henan Provincial Government and the Central and Southern Heavy Industry Department the appropriate punishment. The Central and Southern Military and Political Committee should also strictly conduct self-criticism for its lack of strict pre-event inspection and insufficient attention after the event. The meeting unanimously approved the above proposals, and finally, all attendees stood up and observed three minutes of silence for the deceased workers of the mine to express their condolences.

　　中南军政委员会第五次会议
    检讨宜洛煤矿事件     
    决定切实加强工矿安全设备
    对人民生命财产严肃负责
    无保安制度劳动纪律是发生此次事件原因
    【新华社汉口三日电】中南军政委员会于上月二十九日举行第五次行政例会，出席所属各委、部、署、局、行长二十八人。会议由邓子恢副主席主持，主要内容为对河南省宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件进行了严格检讨，并通过五项处理办法。
    会议首由中南区重工业部朱毅部长报告了宜洛煤矿发生巨大瓦斯爆炸事件的原因、经过和善后工作情形。该事件发生于二月二十七日，被炸面积达一○、六○○平方公尺，占井下全部面积约三分之一以上，爆炸区内巷道塌陷约三分之一，死亡工友据已查知者有一百四十六人。造成工人生命及国家财产的严重损失。据初步调查和分析，此次肇事系由于历来该矿沼气较大，且用土法开采，无通风设备，井口少，风流极弱，又有漏风现象，虽经工友数次提及，但未引起该矿行政领导人员和主管工程人员注意和抓紧修整，致热度增高，沼气聚集。加之该矿无下井检查制，很多人在井下吸烟。三月七日由井下运出之四具尸体中，身上均装有红头火柴及纸烟。此次事件之发生可能系吸烟划火引起。该矿巷道工程又极不牢固，由爆炸震动，引起棚架多处塌陷，故增大死伤。
    上述情况的产生，系由于该矿无保安规则，无劳动纪律，工作制度及检查制度极不健全，职工间互不团结，存在着严重的无政府无纪律现象所致。具体原因及详细情况，现尚在继续检查中。此一事件的发生，引起中央人民政府、中南军政委员会及河南省人民政府的极大重视，已立即拨款并派员前往调查，并处理善后救济事宜。中南区总工会筹委会与中南军政委员会重工业部，均派人携款前往慰问死难工人家属。经紧急抢救后，重伤工友二十七人中，已有二十四人脱离危险期。现该矿工人正在行政机构与工会领导下，化悲痛为力量，迅速掩埋尸体，进行抢修，以期早日恢复生产。朱部长在检讨中说：该矿早经中央决定由中南军政委员会重工业部接管，但该部却迟迟未予接受；在暂由河南省人民政府直接领导期间，又未加强对该省工矿的领导。因此，此一事件之发生，该部须负主要责任，请求中南军政委员会予以处分。
    接着，中南军政委员会财经委员会副主任李一清、监察委员会副主任钱瑛亦均进行了检讨。李副主任检讨了该委员会没有完全贯彻中央各次会议的精神，对公营企业进行系统改革，致使宜洛煤矿等仍存在着相当严重的不合理现象，造成此一后果，自请处分。钱副主任说：该事件发生后，中央监察委员会已派人前往调查，而中南区监察委员会却未加以重视，应进行深刻检讨。
    邓副主席最后发言，沉痛地指出：此次宜洛煤矿爆炸，死伤工友一百多人，这是严重的惨案。邓副主席着重说：国民党反动政府一向草菅人命，对劳动人民的死伤更是漠不关心。但人民政府应该对人民生命财产负责，首先对人民生命负责，特别对劳动人民的生命负责。我们应当坚决反对对劳动人民生命开玩笑的态度。因此，邓副主席提议：（一）首先批准河南省人民政府对处理宜洛死伤工友所支付的埋葬、治伤、抚恤、垫发工资救济家属等费用，由中南军政委员会财经委员会予以报销。（二）切实检查宜洛煤矿的安全设备，在未有安全保证以前，不急于开工。（三）立即通令全中南各地工矿，并由重工业部派员前往调查，依照中央屡次指示，切实检查安全设备，务求保证工友安全。不合安全标准者，立即改装，甚至停止开工，保证不再发生类似事件。（四）责成各省、县政府与军事机关，对当地厂矿受土匪特务威胁者，立即派武装保护，并加紧肃清土匪特务，以保工矿安全。（五）对宜洛事件责任的追究，除宜洛厂矿负责人及河南工商厅已决定处分外，建议中央人民政府给河南省府及中南重工业部以应有处分。中南军政委员会对此事事前检查不严，事后重视不够，亦应严格地进行自我检讨。会议一致通过上述提议，最后与会全体人员起立为该矿死难工友静默三分钟，以示哀悼。
