    Convenes People's Representative Conference
    Plans to Restore Agricultural and Pastoral Construction in the New Ulanqab League
    [Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 19th] The first Ulanqab League People's Representative Conference of all circles in Suiyuan Province was held in Ulan Hure from the 4th to the 14th. The representatives present included workers, farmers, herdsmen, and lamas from all Mongolian, Han, and Hui ethnic groups in the entire league, as well as princes, nobles, and living Buddhas, totaling 120 people. The conference was filled with a spirit of democracy and unity from beginning to end. The conference accepted and discussed 142 proposals from people's representatives from all walks of life in pastoral and agricultural areas and formulated proposals for restoring agriculture and animal husbandry and building a new Ulanqab League based on the urgent needs of all ethnic groups and the specific conditions of the league. The conference stipulated that in agricultural areas, it is necessary to maintain last year's cultivated area, not to abandon cultivated land, and to ensure the completion of the production task of 300,000 shi of grain this year. The People's Autonomous Government of the League should transfer cadres to cooperate with the people's governments of all ethnic groups to organize production work teams, go deep into the countryside to launch the spring plowing movement, assist the townships in establishing production committees. All localities should promote low-interest loans, rent cattle to herdsmen, issue agricultural loans with emphasis, solve the difficulties of poor farmers in obtaining cattle and seeds, implement reasonable burdens, and appropriately improve the relationship between landlords and tenants. In pastoral areas, under the slogan of prosperity for both people and livestock, the wolf-hunting campaign should be launched first. The conference stipulated that May 6th to 21st would be the League-wide Wolf Hunting Week. The whole League would kill 1,070 wolves this year, implementing a reward method of awarding one large dou of millet for killing a large wolf, five sheng of millet for killing a small wolf, and the wolf skin belonging to the wolf hunter. In order to treat various venereal diseases prevalent among the Mongolians and various livestock diseases in various banners, the conference decided that the League People's Autonomous Government would organize mobile medical teams for people and livestock to go to various places for treatment.
    It is reported that the Ulanqab League currently governs six banners: Siziwang Banner, Darhan Banner, Maoming'an Banner, East Gong Banner, West Gong Banner, and Middle Gong Banner. Mongolian, Han, and Hui ethnic groups live together within the territory. Under the unified leadership of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the Suiyuan Military Region, and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region People's Government and the Ulanqab League Military Sub-district were established on April 1st of this year.
