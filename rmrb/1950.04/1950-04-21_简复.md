To Du Renrui:

Regarding the questions you inquired about, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education has replied as follows:

    If a student loses their transfer certificate, they can apply to the original school for a replacement. Students who have suspended their studies for any reason can resume their studies at the grade level they were at when they suspended. Although they may have taken supplementary courses during the suspension period, this cannot be considered formal academic achievement. If the original school has closed down and a certificate cannot be obtained, you can contact the Second Section of the Bureau of Culture and Education for resolution.

　　简复杜人瑞君：
    你所询的问题，现经北京市人民政府文教局答复如下：
    学生将转学证书遗失，可向原校申请补发。凡因故休学学生，可按休学年级复学，休学期间虽经补习某科课程亦不能据为正式成绩。如原校已停办，不能取得证书时，可到文教局第二科接洽解决。
