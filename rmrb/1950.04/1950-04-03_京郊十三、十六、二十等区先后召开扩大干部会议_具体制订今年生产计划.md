　　【Our Newspaper News】The district governments and district committees of the thirteenth, sixteenth, and twentieth districts of Beijing suburbs successively convened expanded cadre meetings for districts and villages in the latter half of last month. These meetings conveyed and arranged the agricultural production plan for 1950, calling on all cadres to strive to complete the task of "increasing production by 10%." Ma, the head of the thirteenth district, conveyed the production tasks proposed by the Suburban Committee and announced that a production guidance committee would be jointly formed by the district government, district committee, public security bureau, and mass organizations. The primary task is to lead and organize mass production to ensure the completion of this year's production increase target. After the communication, cadres from various districts and villages conducted group discussions, and the cadres were enthusiastic and highly confident. Cadres in the sixteenth district proposed many specific measures in the discussion, such as: (1) Vigorously mobilize the masses to further develop the manure accumulation campaign, so that each mu of land will be fertilized with an additional 25 catties of fertilizer. (2) Dig new wells and repair old wells to transform dry land into irrigated land or irrigated land into garden plots. (3) Organize mutual assistance and hoe the land one more time. (4) Adapt to local conditions. District 14 has more sandy land, so plant more peanuts and sweet potatoes. Cadres in various districts and villages all said that after returning to their villages, they would work with Party and League members in their villages to take the lead and guide the masses in good production. At the meeting, seven administrative villages also proposed a production competition to neighboring villages. Zhang Guiyou, the deputy head of Balizhuang Village in the thirteenth district, announced his village's production plan at the meeting, stating that the village would increase production by 20% this year, and challenged Xintian Village and other villages in the district. After this meeting, cadres in various districts, in formulating production plans based on specific conditions and through in-depth discussions and detailed calculations, further increased their confidence in increasing production by 10% and generally eliminated the idea of emphasizing difficulties. Everyone believed that the district had the confidence to increase production by 10%. For example, in the sixteenth district, the 30 million catties of dredged ditch mud alone is equivalent to an increase of 3 million catties of dry manure, which can increase millet production by 1.1 million catties.

　　京郊十三、十六、二十等区先后召开扩大干部会议  具体制订今年生产计划
    【本报讯】京郊十三、十六、二十区区政府、区委会于上月下旬先后召开区、村扩大干部会议，传达与布置一九五○年的农业生产计划，号召全体干部为完成“增产一成”而努力。十三区马区长传达了郊委会提出的生产任务后，并宣布由区政府、区委会、公安局、群众团体等共同组成生产指导委员会，首要任务即是领导与组织群众生产，保证完成今年增产任务。传达后各区、村干部分别进行小组讨论，干部们兴致勃勃，信心很高。十六区各村干部在讨论中提出了不少具体办法，如：（一）大力动员群众进一步开展积肥运动，达到每亩地要多上肥二十五斤。（二）凿新井修旧井，变旱地为水浇地或变水浇地为园田。（三）组织互助，多锄一遍。（四）因地制宜，十四区沙土地较多，要多种花生、白薯。各区村干部都表示回村后，协同本村党、团员起带头作用，领导群众好好生产。会上，并有七个行政村向邻村提出生产竞赛。十三区八里庄村副张贵友在会上宣布了他村的生产计划，今年全村要增产百分之二十。并提出和本区辛田村等村挑战。经过此次会议。各区干部在根据具体情况制订生产计划中，并通过深入讨论、详细计算的过程中，更进一步增加了对增产一成的信心，一般都消除了强调困难的思想。一致相信该区有把握增产一成。如十六区仅以拉得的沟泥三千万斤而言，即等于增加粪干三百万斤，可增产小米一百一十万斤。
