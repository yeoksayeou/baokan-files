　　贯彻管理民主化和经营企业化
    察省工业会议确定下季生产任务
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报四月二日消息：察省人民政府于上月二十五日召开工业会议，确定第二季生产任务和要求。会议总的精神是：继续贯彻重点领导，实现管理民主化与经营企业化的方针。在第二季生产中，省市领导重点首先要放在国营口泉煤矿、平旺发电厂、龙烟铁矿、下花园发电厂。对一般厂矿则要求以二月份成本决算为标准，减低成本百分之五到百分之十；提高产品质量，合乎规格标准。
    关于经营企业化的问题，会议指出一定要依靠工人阶级克服困难。首先，各厂矿在六月份以前，一律完成清理资产、确定资金。其次，制订修建、生产、劳动组织、成本、原材料、资金周转等计划，以便逐步走向经营企业化。再次，在可能实现的厂矿中实行定额管理。实行生产专责制与奖惩制，以改善经营。
    为实现管理民主化，会议指出：首先是加强干部学习，搞通思想；并要通过各种运动，提高工人政治觉悟。其次是认真教育生产管理人员，克服保守思想和官僚主义，开展批评与自我批评。第三、重视工人合理化建议，搞好工厂管理委员会与工人代表会。
