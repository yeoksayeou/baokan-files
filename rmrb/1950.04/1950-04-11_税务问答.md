Tax Q&A

Question:
　　Our business opened on December 1, 1949. Should our business's business tax for the second half of 1949 be calculated from the date of opening, or should we pay on a half-year basis? Please reply.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 Gong Jixing, No. 17, Yangrou Hutong, Ninth District, this city

Answer:
　　We have forwarded your question to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau for a reply as follows:
　　Your business opened in December of last year. The industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949 should be levied from the actual date of operation, and the amount of tax payable will be determined by democratic appraisal.

Question:
　　I have several rooms that I sold in January of this year, and the procedures have been completed at the Land Administration Bureau. I will be able to hand over the house to the new owner in April, but a dispute has arisen between the two parties regarding the property tax for the spring of 1950. Which party should bear this tax?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 Wu Ye

Answer:
　　According to the reply from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau: If the property rights procedures for the house you sold were indeed completed and clearly transferred in January 1950, then the 1950 property tax should be paid by the new owner. As for the old owner only being able to hand over the house in April, this is a private dispute and another matter, which can be resolved separately.

　　税务问答问：
    敝号于一九四九年十二月一日开业，敝号应纳之一九四九年度后半季营业税，是由开张之日起计算？还是按半季纳税？请答复。
                          本市第九区羊肉胡同十七号  公记兴答：
    你的问题，我们已转请北京市人民政府税务局答复如下：
    你号是在去年十二月间开业一九四九年下半年工商业税应自实际营业之日起征收，至应纳税额，则以民主评议方式决定之。
                                                  编者问：
    本人有房数间，于今年一月卖出，现已在地政局办完手续。四月即可将房腾交新业主，惟因一九五○年春季房产税双方起了争执，此税究应那方面担负？
                                                武野答：
    根据北京市人民政府税务局答复：你所卖房屋，如确于一九五○年一月即已将产权手续办理，且转移清楚，则一九五○年房屋税应由新业主交纳。至于所说旧业主到四月份始能腾房，这是你们私人纠纷，为另一问题，可自行解决。
