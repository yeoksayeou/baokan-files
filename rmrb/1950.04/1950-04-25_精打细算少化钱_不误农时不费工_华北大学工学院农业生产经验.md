　　Careful Calculation Saves Money, Timely Farming Saves Labor
    Agricultural Production Experience of the North China University of Technology

    The agricultural production of the North China University of Technology, initially based on research by the University Production Committee, aimed to harvest 5,500 jin of vegetables per mu. After deducting labor and fertilizer costs and repaying loans, the annual profit would be 2,000 jin of millet. In addition to hired labor, students would only need to spend four hours every two weeks on production, which would not hinder their studies.

    Later, the Production Committee discovered that the target walls in the Miao family's land could be demolished. This solved the problem of bricks for well-digging and house-building. Each brick saved seven liang of millet. Therefore, Vice President Zeng personally led everyone to demolish the bricks. The adhesion between the cement and the bricks was greater than the cohesion of the bricks themselves, making it very difficult to dismantle them. Many comrades had blisters and broken skin on their hands, but everyone persisted. As a result, the highest record for brick demolition was 200 bricks in four hours per group. The third grade students of the Russian Specialized Course worked three extra hours despite having finished eating, demolishing more than 2,000 bricks, saving 1,000 jin of millet.

    Following this, the Production Committee discovered a large number of temple wall bricks buried near the vegetable garden and a large water pit. This increased the source of bricks and allowed for early irrigation.

    Agricultural timing is crucial. If production waited until the well was dug, the harvest of a season of Chinese cabbage would be missed. The Production Committee decided to use the two-day spring break to irrigate the land with water from the pit. No fertilizer was purchased, and green manure would be used instead. Thus, the spring break officially began with large-scale production.

    It rained on the first day, but the comrades' enthusiasm for work remained high. Drawing water from the pit was difficult, but thanks to the efforts of the students, the water-drawing record gradually increased. Initially, only 30 willow buckets could be drawn every ten minutes, but later the highest reached 59 buckets. As a result, we dug and moved more than 7,000 bricks in two days, raked six mu of ridges, leveled half a mu of slope, irrigated four mu of land, and prepared the foundation for house construction.

    Sowing began on the 6th. We sowed three mu of spinach, Chinese cabbage, and small radishes. The spinach and Chinese cabbage have already sprouted.

    This phase of production prepared the conditions for future production, while saving nearly 4,000 jin of millet in well-digging bricks, house-building materials, and fertilizer costs.

    Now let's calculate again. The total annual harvest is equivalent to 15,000 jin of millet, with an investment of only 8,000 to 9,000 jin of millet, resulting in a profit of 6,000 to 7,000 jin of millet.

    The first phase of production is largely over. We deeply realized that in production, "careful calculation to save money and timely farming to save labor" is very important.

　　精打细算少化钱  不误农时不费工
    华北大学工学院农业生产经验
    华北大学工学院的农业生产，起初由院生产委员会研究结果，每亩以收菜五千五百斤计，除去人工、肥料，还了贷款，全年可赚二千斤小米。除雇用人工外，同学们每两周只要去生产四小时，就够了，不会妨碍学习。
    后来，生产委员会发现苗家地的靶墙可以拆掉，这样，就解决了打井和盖房的用砖问题，每拆下一块砖，就可以节省七两米。于是，曾副院长就亲带大家前去拆砖。洋灰和砖的附着力比砖本身的凝聚力还大，真是难拆，好多同志手都打泡了，碰破了，但大家还是一直坚持到底。结果，拆砖的最高纪录是一组四小时二百块。俄专普三班不顾吃饭多干三小时活，结果拆了二千多块砖，节约了一千斤小米。
    接着，生产委员会又发现了菜地左近埋着的大量庙墙砖和一个大水坑，这样既增加了用砖的来源，又可以提前浇地下种。
    农时不能误，如等打好井再开始生产，就要误一季小白菜的收获。生产委员会研究决定，利用二天春假，打水坑的水浇地，没肥不买，等着使青肥。于是春假正式开始了大生产。
    第一天下雨，但同志们干活的热情仍很高。在水坑里打水是很难的，但由于同学们的努力，打水纪录逐渐增加，开始时每十分钟只能打三十柳罐，后来，最高打到五十九罐。结果，我们两天刨搬了七千多块砖，搂了六亩地的畦，刨坡平地半亩，浇地四亩，还打好了盖房的地基。
    六号开始播种，我们播种了三亩菠菜、小白菜、小萝卜，菠菜、小白菜现已长出了。
    这一段生产，准备了以后生产的条件，同时节省打井砖、盖房工料、肥料等费用近小米四千斤。
    现在我们再算一下，全年收获折一万五千斤小米，投资只有八九千斤小米，利润达六七千斤小米。
    第一段生产算是大体结束了，我们深深体会到，在生产中，“精打细算少化钱，不误农时不费工”是很要紧的。
