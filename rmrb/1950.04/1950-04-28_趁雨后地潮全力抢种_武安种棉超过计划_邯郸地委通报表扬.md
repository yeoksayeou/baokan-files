　　Taking Advantage of the Moisture After the Rain to Seize the Opportunity to Plant
    Wu'an's Cotton Planting Exceeds the Plan
    Handan Prefectural Committee Commends
    [Handan News] Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, due to the mature ideological mobilization of the masses, in-depth leadership, and timely promotion of experience, planted 370,000 mu of cotton within three days after the rain, exceeding the original plan by 50,000 mu. The Handan Prefectural Committee issued a circular of commendation.
    After the rain on April 14th and 15th, the county started sowing on the 16th. By the 18th, the cotton planting campaign was basically completed in the cotton-growing areas, except for the mountainous areas where the start was delayed due to heavy rain and individual lagging villages in the plains. According to current information, the 320,000 mu task assigned by the higher authorities has been greatly exceeded. According to the number of 370,000 mu reported by the county at the enlarged cadre meeting, the plan has also been completed. It is estimated that when sowing is completed, it will reach more than 380,000 mu.
    The original task assigned to the Eighth District for cotton planting was 45,000 mu, but the number reported at the challenge was 65,000 mu, which has been completed. In the future, at least 70,000 mu can be achieved. During the sowing process, many villages in the county almost completely eliminated bare land. In Xiyingjing Village, First District, only 52 mu of the village's 2,082 mu of bare land remained. In Junhe Village, Eighth District, 158 out of 170 households in the entire village planted cotton. Shangquan Village planted cotton on 70% of the village's land, approaching the pre-war level.
    The original plan for the B2 strain of Si Zi cotton promotion area was to plant 80,000 mu. Because the masses liked it, they independently adjusted seeds and tried to save seeds during planting. They also seized the opportunity to purchase cotton ginning seeds in the rain, expanding the Si Zi cotton fields to about 100,000 mu.
    The rapid completion of the sowing task in Wu'an County was not accidental. The ideological mobilization for cotton planting in the county started last year. During the inspection and comparison before the autumn harvest last year, the masses' enthusiasm for cotton planting was inspired. When planting wheat, a plan of 320,000 mu for cotton planting was allocated, but at that time, the masses only expected to plant 270,000 mu. After the county's second people's representative conference and the year-end planning, the plan was further implemented to households. At the enlarged cadre meeting on April 5th, the number increased to 370,000 mu when each district made their challenges. After the meeting, each district launched challenges between villages. In addition to ideological mobilization, the county supply and marketing cooperative prepared 550,000 jin of fertilizer, the bank loaned 38,000 jin, and 880,000 jin of cotton seeds (including 350,000 jin of Si Zi cotton). Sixty-five double-legged plows were acquired, and the county agricultural science department also prepared 400 jin of Ryonggong medicine powder.
    In order to overcome the cadres' paralysis, after criticizing complacency at the enlarged cadre meeting, the county organized a 42-member inspection team led by the county head and county party secretary to conduct in-depth inspections and immediately mobilize early planting. This action made practical preparations for the all-out effort to plant cotton after the rain.
    During the rain on the 14th and 15th, the county organized a second batch of 40 cadres and 120 teachers and students from the normal school to go to the third, eighth, fifth, and fourth districts to mobilize a concentrated effort to plant.
    At this time, the government issued a notice guaranteeing cotton prices. The county formulated a cotton planting propaganda outline. Cooperatives signed contracts with the masses. Village branches universally held meetings with the participation of representatives of mutual aid teams, labor heroes, and models. The benefits of cotton planting last year were used to specifically calculate accounts and address the masses' concerns about whether cotton prices could be guaranteed if more cotton was planted, whether livestock would have grass to eat, whether people would have rice to eat, whether the government would collect cotton, and how to handle the May burden. They organized mutual aid for sowing tools and plows based on livestock and plows. At the same time, they vigorously adjusted seeds, vigorously publicized policies, mobilized door-to-door, promoted mixing seeds with plant ash, and made all preparations.
    On the 16th, when the weather cleared, under the slogan "Spring rain is as precious as oil, not a single mu of bare land should be left" (the use of "not a single mu of bare land should be left" in cotton planting should not be absolutized to avoid coercive orders - author's note). Most of the masses immediately took active action, and few people could be seen in the villages.
    On the second day of the sowing campaign, 280,000 mu had been planted. The county party committee issued instructions stating that it was entering an in-depth stage, preventing complacent and slack thoughts, recognizing that those who left bare land were those with the greatest ideological concerns or the most difficult labor and animal power, and that they should be patiently mobilized to solve practical difficulties and prevent administrative orders. The Third District proposed to carry out an inspection campaign to check bare land and compare cotton planting, so as to deepen the campaign.
    During the sowing process, party members and cadres actively took the lead. The deputy secretary of Shangquan Village in the Eighth District planted all of his 43 mu of land with cotton, except for 12 mu of wheat. Li Yubao, a labor hero from Boyan in the Third District, planted all of his 13 mu of land early before the rain. Tang Youfu, the party branch secretary of Hejiazhuang in the Tenth District, and party members in the village supply and marketing cooperative ran to the city in the rain, solved the problem of 3,000 jin of flower seeds for the masses without eating for a day, and loaned out 10,000 jin of sesame cakes, enabling the planting of 1,100 mu of cotton in the entire village. Mutual aid for sowing was very common during the sowing campaign. In Hejiazhuang in the Tenth District, only four households planted their own land. In Dongsizhuang in the Fifth District, 216 households had 56 mutual aid teams, and only 23 households did not have mutual aid.
    During this cotton sowing campaign, the county and districts organized communication telephone mobile forces to quickly guide the development of the campaign through reporting, instructions, and letter writing.
    The districts in the county were able to flexibly grasp the leadership. In addition to one main cadre staying in the district to maintain contact with superiors and subordinates to grasp the overall situation, other main cadres could be in the base villages and inspect general villages, maintain contact with various villages, promptly spread experience, solve problems, and develop the campaign.

　　趁雨后地潮全力抢种
    武安种棉超过计划
    邯郸地委通报表扬
    【邯郸讯】河北邯郸专区武安县由于群众思想酝酿成熟，领导深入，及时推广经验，雨后三天内，种棉三十七万亩，超过原计划五万亩，邯郸地委予以通报表扬。
    四月十四、十五落雨之后，该县在十六日开始播种，到十八日全县除山区因雨大动手迟和平地个别落后村庄外，植棉区播种运动基本结束。据现在了解，上级分配的三十二万亩任务已大大超过。按全县扩大干部会上挑战时自报数目三十七万亩，也已完成计划。估计播种完毕可达三十八万余亩。
    该县八区种棉原分配任务四万五千亩，挑战时自报数目六万五千亩已完成，将来至少可作到七万亩。播种中，该县不少村几乎作到全部消灭白地。一区西营井全村二○八二亩白地，只剩五十二亩。八区均河村全村一百七十户，一百五十八户全部种上棉。上泉村种棉达全村土地的百分之七十，将达战前水平。
    斯字棉Ｂ２号推广区原计划植棉八万亩，因为群众喜爱，自行调剂种籽和下种中尽力节省种籽，雨中又抓紧购棉轧花籽，使斯字区棉田扩大到约在十万亩左右。
    武安县种棉能这样迅速完成播种任务，这不是偶然的。该县植棉的思想动员从去年就开始了。去年秋收前检查比较中，就启发了群众种棉热情。种麦时分配种棉计划三十二万亩，但当时群众只预计种到二十七万亩，经过该县二次各界人民代表会，年关订计划才进一步把计划贯彻到户。四月五日全县扩大干部会上，各区挑战时，增加到三十七万亩。会后各区发动了村与村挑战，除了思想动员外，县供销社准备了肥料五十五万斤，银行贷了三万八千斤，花籽八十八万斤（内斯字棉三十五万斤），两条腿耧六十五张，县农业科又准备了四百斤龙汞药粉。
    为了克服干部麻痹，扩干会上批判了自满情绪后，县里又组织了四十二个人的检查队，由县长、县委书记率领深入检查和立即发动早种，这一行动给雨后全力突击种棉，作了实际上的准备。
    十四、十五落雨当中，县里又组织了第二批四十个干部和师范一百二十个师生冒雨下乡，分头到三、八、五、四区去发动突击下种。
    此时，政府又颁发保证棉价布告，县里制定了种棉宣传提纲，合作社找群众订合同，各村普遍开支部党员大会，聘请全体代表互助组长劳动英雄模范参加，用去年种棉得利，具体算账和解决群众怕种花多能否保证棉价、怕牲口没草吃、人没米吃、政府是否收棉、五月负担如何办等顾虑，组织了以牲口和耧为主的播具、播耧互助。同时又大力调剂了种籽，大力宣传政策，挨门挨户动员，提倡草木灰拌种，作好一切准备。
    十六日天晴，在“春雨贵如油，一亩白地也不留”口号下（一亩白地不留用在种棉上不要绝对化，以免发生强迫命令——作者按）。大部群众即积极行动起来，村里很少看见到人。
    播种运动第二天，就种到二十八万亩了，县委发出指示说明进入深入阶段，防止自满松懈思想，认识留下白地的就是思想顾虑最大或劳畜力最困难的户，要很好耐心动员，解决实际困难，防止行政命令。三区此时提出开展查白地、比种花的检查运动，使运动走向深入。
    播种中党员干部积极起了带头作用。八区上泉村副支书四十三亩地，除十二亩麦地外，全部种了花。三区伯延劳动英雄李玉保十三亩地雨前就全部早种上了。十区何家庄支部书记唐有富及村供销社中党员在下雨中跑到城里，一天未吃饭为群众解决了花籽三千斤，贷出油饼一万斤，使全村一千一百亩棉花下了种。播种运动中，互助进行播种很普遍。十区何家庄只有四户是自己种自己的。五区东寺庄二一六户有五十六个互助组，只二十三户没互助。
    在这次棉花播种运动中，该县、区里都组织了通迅电话机动力量，通报、指示、写信都迅速指导了运动的开展。
    该县各区在领导上很能机动掌握，主要干部除一人留区坚持与上下级连系掌握全面情况，其他主要干部可在基点村，并检查一般村，多与各村连系，及时传播经验，解决问题，开展运动。
