Harbin Railway Bureau Workshop Signs Collective Contract

[This newspaper dispatch] The Harbin Railway Bureau Workshop formally signed a collective contract on March 14. In the half-month since, work in all departments has improved accordingly, and preliminary experience in establishing contracts has been gained. In order to universally promote collective contracts, the Harbin Railway Sub-Federation of Trade Unions formed a working group in February to conduct pilot work at the workshop. Initially, the workers mistakenly believed that "signing a contract just means making us work more." To dispel this concern, the working group and the trade union cadres went separately to the trade union groups to conduct repeated explanatory work, giving the workers a preliminary understanding. Then, based on the workshop's March work plan, the workers were mobilized to study and propose how they would guarantee its realization and what matters the administration needed to resolve. Then, the trade union representatives negotiated with the administration on behalf of the workers, and after discussion by the workers' representative meeting, a draft contract was formulated; after further study by all the workers, and with the unanimous agreement of both parties, a formal signing ceremony was held. Since the signing of the contract, there has been progress in delivering cars on time compared to the past. When inspecting Locomotive 1040, the administration stipulated four days, but the task was completed in three days. The ironworker group had as many as one hundred and ten rework jobs in January, but in the last half month, they have been basically eliminated. Based on the workshop's experience in signing contracts, there are the following points: (1) The administrative plan must be precisely calculated, specific, and clear. For example, in the workshop's preliminary production plan for March, there were words such as "several," which were all specified after discussion by the workers. (2) The establishment of a contract must undergo full deliberation and democratic discussion. Only in this way can the problems and opinions that workers need to solve in their daily work be fully expressed, and can the workshop's production plan be transformed into the workers' actions, giving play to their enthusiasm for production. For example, the contract stipulates that in addition to completing A, B, and C inspections, the ironworker group must also make three thousand six hundred and thirty spare parts in March. After discussion by the workers, the plan was completed by the 25th of last month, and a batch of tasks was requested from the administration, and the quality was good. (3) The content of the contract should clearly define the specific responsibilities of both parties, but the clauses should not be too many. The content of the workshop's April contract only includes the administrative work plan and work quality, the responsibilities of the administrative leaders, and the matters guaranteed by all employees under the leadership of the trade union. Clear responsibilities facilitate inspection and strengthen individual work planning; if there are too many clauses, it will be difficult for the workers to remember them. (4) After the contract is established, inspection from top to bottom or from bottom to top is the most important work of the leadership. For general short-term contracts, there should be at least two inspections a month, and the summary should be announced to the workers, with good performance praised and rewarded to encourage the workers' enthusiasm. Matters that need attention should be raised in a timely manner to clarify the goals of the struggle. (5) Clarify the content of the trade union's focus on production. Establishing a contract is a concrete path for the trade union to lead production. To this end, trade union cadres must break away from the circle of bureaucratism, go deep into the groups, become familiar with the production process, situation, and current main problems of each workshop, so as to help workers solve difficulties and overcome shortcomings, and promptly advise the administration to improve work. However, the unresolved issue at the workshop is the issue of rewards. Because some of the workshop's workers are on piece-rate wages, and some are not, it is difficult to determine the standard. Last month, rewards were based on winning the red flag, and are still under study.

### 哈尔滨机务段工场签订集体合同

　　哈尔滨机务段工场签订集体合同
    【本报讯】哈尔滨机务段工场于三月十四日正式签订集体合同，半月来各部门工作均随之提高，并获得订立合同的初步经验。哈尔滨铁路分总工会为普遍推行集体合同，特于二月份组成工作组，在该场作试点工作。开始，工友们误认为“订合同还不是叫咱多干活”。为解除这种思想顾虑，工作组和段工会干部分头深入到工会小组中进行反复的解释工作，使工友们有了初步的认识。继则根据该段三月份工作计划，发动工人研究，提出自己如何保证实现及行政所必须解决的事项。然后由工会代表工人与行政协商，并经工人代表会讨论，制订出合同草案；再经全体工友的研究，双方均一致同意时，始正式举行签字大会。自签订合同以来，按时进车方面已较前有进步，甲检一○四○机车时，行政规定四天，结果三天完成任务。铁工组一月份反工活达百十件之多，最近半月已基本消灭。根据该厂签订合同的经验，有如下几点：（一）行政计划必须要经过精密核算，具体明确。如该场三月份初步生产计划中，曾有“若干”等字样，经过工友的讨论，全部都具体化了。（二）订立合同必须经过充分酝酿和民主讨论。只有这样才能把工人在日常工作中所需要解决的问题和意见充分发表出来，也才能把工场的生产计划变成工人的行动，发挥生产积极性。如合同规定：铁工组三月份除完成甲乙丙检修外，还要作三、六三○件备品。经过工友的讨论，上月二十五日即完成了计划，又向行政要了一批任务，而且质量良好。（三）合同内容要双方责任明确具体，但条文不宜过多。该场四月份合同内容仅包括行政的工作计划与工作质量、行政首长的责任及全体职工在工会领导下所保证的事项。责任明确，则便于检查和加强个人工作计划性；条文过多了，工友将不易记清。（四）订立合同后，自上而下或自下而上的检查，是领导上最重要的工作。一般的短期合同，一个月至少得检查两次，并要向工友公布总结，好的表扬奖励，以鼓励工友的积极性。需要注意的事项，要及时提出，以明确奋斗目标。（五）明确工会面向生产的内容。订立合同是工会领导生产的具体道路，为此工会干部必须摆脱事务主义的圈子，深入到小组中去，熟悉各场生产过程，情况及当前主要问题，以便帮助工友解决困难和克服缺点，及时建议行政改进工作。但目前该场尚未解决的是奖励问题。因该场有部分计件工资制，有非计件人员，因此很难确定标准。上月是按夺红旗为准进行奖励，现仍在研究中。
