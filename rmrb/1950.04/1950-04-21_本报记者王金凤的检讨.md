　　Self-Criticism by Our Newspaper Reporter Wang Jinfeng
    On April 2nd, this newspaper published my report on the "Curriculum Reform of Liberal Arts Colleges in Beijing and Tianjin Universities." There were some shortcomings in it, and I should conduct a deep self-criticism. After investigation and research by various parties, the report is still correct in its basic arguments and principles. What I need to strictly examine is that I did not grasp the materials comprehensively enough, and the interviews were not in-depth enough, so the examples I gave were not very appropriate. Now, based on new materials obtained from further investigations, I make the following statement: It is inappropriate to use the Literary Theory of the Western Language Department of Peking University as a typical example of being inconsistent in name and reality. The History of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy in the Philosophy Department of Peking University was scheduled to be offered but was not actually offered. The Chinese Modern Economic History, Economic Construction of New Democracy, and Economic Geography courses in the Economics Department of Peking University have already been assigned professors. The World Literature History in the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University was not offered because the professor changed to teaching other courses. The Study of Oracle Bone Inscriptions in the Chinese Department is not a newly opened course. The Local Administration course offered by the Political Science Department of Peking University is an independent course and does not belong to the policy and regulations section. The above are all discrepancies and inappropriate distinctions that occurred in the examples and should be corrected accordingly.

　　本报记者王金凤的检讨
    四月二日本报发表我的关于“京津各大学文法学院课程改革”的报导，其中有些缺点，我应该进行深刻的检讨。经过各方面调查研究的结果，这个报道在基本论点及原则上仍是正确的。我需要严格检讨的是掌握材料还不够全面，采访不够深入，因而举例有些不很恰当，现根据继续调查所得的新材料，作如下声明：以北大西语系文艺学作为名实不符的典型例子是不妥当的；北大哲学系的马列主义哲学史是预定要开而实则未开；北大经济系中国近代经济史、新民主主义的经济建设及经济地理三个课程已经聘定教授；清华中文系的世界文学史因教授改开别的课程而没有开；中文系的卜辞研究不是新开课程；北大政治系所开地方行政是独立的课程，不是属于政策法令的一部分。以上这些都是属于举例中发生的出入和分寸不当的地方，应一并更正。
