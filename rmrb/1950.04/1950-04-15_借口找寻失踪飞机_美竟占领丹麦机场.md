Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: TASS Stockholm, April 12th: Danish newspapers report that American military aircraft arrived at Danish airports without prior notice. Under the pretext of "searching for a missing plane," the American command occupied Denmark's Kastrup Airport and concentrated a large number of air force units in the Baltic Sea area. The security departments of the Danish and Swedish air forces, as well as the air force formations of Sweden and Denmark, are assisting in the search for the aircraft. American bombers have been allowed to fly over Swedish airspace, especially over important strategic areas. Swedish newspapers have given prominent coverage to the activities of the American Air Force in the Baltic Sea.

Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: TASS Copenhagen, April 13th: All Copenhagen morning newspapers published the news of American Flying Fortresses flying over Soviet airspace near Libau with extra-large headlines, and published the full text of the note from Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to the US government regarding the intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet borders and the attack on Soviet fighter planes. The headline of "Land og Folk" (Land and People) was: "American Bomber Launches Attack in Soviet Airspace."

Editorials in "Land og Folk" and "Politiken" commented on the US Air Force's exercises in the Baltic Sea. "Land og Folk" wrote in an editorial entitled "Denmark - Outpost of War Provocateurs": "American provocations have reached an unprecedented level. American military leaders actually sent aircraft to fly over Soviet airspace thousands of kilometers away from the American mainland, where the aircraft not only disregarded the Soviet authorities' advice to land but also opened fire on Soviet aircraft." "Politiken" wrote in its editorial: "Even if the US insists that the focus of the issue is that the aircraft got lost during a training flight, the Russian side will still suspect that it deliberately took the wrong route to conduct reconnaissance."

Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Telepress Copenhagen, April 11th: Exactly ten years ago, Denmark was occupied by the Nazi bandits. The citizens of Copenhagen were awakened in the early morning by the sound of many German heavy bombers circling low over the city. At the tenth anniversary held on the 9th, all of this was vividly recalled. This morning, foreign aircraft again attracted the attention of Copenhagen citizens, circling low over the city without prior warning. However, this time the planes were American. It is said that they were searching for a four-engine bomber that reportedly went missing with four officers and six soldiers while on a "flight exercise" from Wiesbaden to Copenhagen.

Although the US and Britain have excellent airport facilities available for use on the Baltic coast of Germany, they still established a "search" headquarters at Kastrup Airport near Copenhagen. Over the past few days, about twenty-five four-engine bombers carrying approximately three hundred flight personnel have flown there. The officers and soldiers have strict instructions to keep their mission secret, but it is said that these American aircraft will conduct a very careful "search" in every square mile of the Baltic Sea.

Even pro-American Danish newspapers openly suggest that the missing plane is just an excuse to give American bombers and flight personnel the opportunity to test whether Kastrup Airport is suitable for larger military operations and to study the territorial waters of Denmark and Sweden. The Swedish newspaper "Ny Tid" commented: "This looks more like training for a lightning atomic attack than a hastily organized rescue operation."

　　借口找寻失踪飞机  美竟占领丹麦机场
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩十二日讯：丹麦报纸报道：美国军用机事前没有预告即飞抵丹麦飞机场。美国指挥部在“找寻失踪的飞机”的借口下，占领了丹麦的加斯特鲁普飞机场，并在波罗的海区域集中了大量空军。丹麦和瑞典的空军的安全处以及瑞典和丹麦的空军编队，均在协助搜寻飞机的工作。美国轰炸机被允许飞过瑞典的领空，特别是越过重要的战略区域。瑞典报纸极其显著地登载了美国空军在波罗的海活动的消息。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根十三日讯：所有哥本哈根的晨报均以特大标题刊出美国飞行堡垒在苏联利巴雅附近领空飞行的消息，并刊出苏联外交部长维辛斯基就美国飞机侵犯苏联边境并攻击苏联战斗机一事向美国政府提出的照会全文。“国土与人民”报的头条标题是：“美国轰炸机在苏联领空发动攻击”。
    《国土与人民》报和《政策》报的社论，都评论美国空军在波罗的海的演习。《国土与人民》报在题为《丹麦——战争挑拨者的前哨》的社论中写道：“美国的挑衅已到了闻所未闻的程度。美国的军事首脑们居然派飞机飞临远离美国大陆数千公里之远的苏联领空，该机在那里不但不听从苏联当局的建议而着陆，反而向苏联飞机开火。”《政策》报在社论中写道：“即使美国硬说问题的焦点是飞机在练习飞行中迷失了方向，俄国方面仍将怀疑它是特地走错了路来施行侦察的。”
    【新华社十四日讯】电通社哥本哈根十一日讯：整整十年以前，丹麦曾被纳粹匪帮占领过。哥本哈根的市民在清晨被盘旋在市区低空的许多架德国重轰炸机的声音惊醒。在九日举行第十周年纪念时，所有这一切又都被生动地回忆了起来。这天早晨，又有外国的飞机引起了哥本哈根市民的注意，这些飞机没有事先警告就在市区低空盘旋。不过，这一次的飞机是美国的。据说，它们是来搜寻一架四引擎轰炸机的，该机据说是从威斯巴登到哥本哈根作“飞行演习”时和四位军官六位士兵一起失踪了。
    虽然事实上美英在德国波罗的海海岸具有优良的机场设备可资利用，但他们仍在哥本哈根附近的加斯特鲁普机场建立起“搜寻”的总部。在过去数日中，约有二十五架四引擎的轰炸机载运飞行人员约共三百人飞抵那里。官兵们都奉有严格的训令，对于他们的任务要保持秘密，但据说，这些美国飞机在波罗的海上每一方英里中都要作很仔细的“搜寻”。
    纵然是亲美的丹麦报纸，都公开暗示飞机失踪不过是一种借口，好给美国轰炸机和飞行人员以机会去试验加斯特鲁普机场是否适于作更大的军事行动之用，并借此研究一下丹麦和瑞典的领海。瑞典《新时代》报评论称：“这看起来倒很像是训练原子弹的闪电攻击，而不是急忙中组织的救难行动。”
