　　Shangrao Concentration Camp
    Shao Yu
    In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of over 200,000 men launched a treacherous attack on the New Fourth Army's Wan'nan troops, numbering over 10,000, who were tenaciously fighting in the enemy's rear on both sides of the Yangtze River, resulting in the Wan'nan Incident that shocked China and the world. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic individuals imprisoned at that time. He used his skillful brush, filled with intense hatred and love, to depict the facts he witnessed that day, creating the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The monstrous crimes of the Kuomintang secret service bandits and the heroic deeds of revolutionary fighters who refused to yield to death are powerfully portrayed. This collection consists of twenty-three pieces, serialized in this edition. Fifteen pieces have been published previously; today, we publish the sixteenth and seventeenth pieces.

    Unbowed in Death (3)
    Comrade Wang Qi, suffered a nervous breakdown in the concentration camp, but she continued to denounce the enemy. The enemy, on the grounds that she "wouldn't surrender even when insane," buried her alive in Shangrao.
    Unbowed in Death (4)
    Comrade Shi Qi was raped by more than a dozen Chiang-Gu bandits during the Wan'nan Incident and became seriously ill in the concentration camp, unable to move. The secret service bandits demanded that she surrender as a condition for treatment. Comrade Shi Qi resolutely denounced the secret service agents. As a result, she was shot and killed by the secret service agents before the concentration camp was moved to Fujian. Before her sacrifice, she said to Comrade Ye Qinhe in the concentration camp: "...Comrade Qinhe, I am prepared to sacrifice for the Party. As long as the Party knows that I sacrificed for the Party, I will die happily!..."
