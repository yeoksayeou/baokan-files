　　Vietnamese Urban and Rural Masses Hold Rallies
    Celebrating "People's Democratic National Day"
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 5th] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 5th: The people of Vietnam celebrated "The Day of People's Democratic States Recognizing Vietnam" nationwide on the 4th. Mass rallies were held in all liberated cities and villages, where speakers gave detailed accounts of all the major changes that have taken place in the People's Democratic countries of Europe and Asia since the establishment of the People's Democratic regime. The presentations were mainly based on reports made by the Vietnamese delegation after visiting these countries last year. The Voice of Vietnam Radio broadcast a commentary stating that the establishment, consolidation and development of the People's Democratic countries is a direct result of the victory of the Soviet army and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. The seizure of power by the anti-fascist democratic forces, united around the working class and led by the Communist Parties of various countries, has led these Central and Eastern European countries onto the bright road of socialism.

　　越南城乡群众举行集会
    欢庆“人民民主国家日”
    【新华社七日讯】越南通讯社北越五日讯：越南全国人民四日欢庆“庆祝承认越南的人民民主国家日”。所有解放的城市与乡村都举行了群众大会，演说者对于人民民主政权建立以后在欧亚各人民民主国家内所发生的一切重大变化，作了详尽的讲述。讲述的内容主要根据越南代表去年访问这些国家后所作的报告。越南之声电台播送评论称：人民民主国家的建立、巩固与发展，乃是苏军胜利和苏联兄弟般的援助的直接结果。团结在工人阶级周围和由各国共产党所领导的反法西斯民主力量的取得政权，已把这些中欧和东欧的国家领进社会主义的光明大道。
