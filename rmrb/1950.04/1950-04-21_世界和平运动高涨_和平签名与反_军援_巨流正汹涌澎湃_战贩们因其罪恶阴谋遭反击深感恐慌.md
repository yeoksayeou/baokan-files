Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th (TASS): Moscow newspapers today published many commentaries on the growing strength of the peace front. Babin, in an article in Labor Daily, discussed the achievements of the peace movement in the people's democratic countries, saying that the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe play a huge role in the peace front led by the Soviet Union. He pointed out the increasing number of peace committees in urban and rural areas. For example, there are more than 3,000 peace committees in Bulgaria, 4,000 in Poland, and 7 million people participating in the peace movement in Romania. Babin wrote: Now, in all people's democratic countries, a huge movement has been launched to collect signatures for the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Millions of people attended mass meetings held in hundreds of cities and thousands of villages. They all unanimously signed this appeal.

A columnist for international affairs in the News Daily wrote: The new war instigators see every day that the struggle waged by hundreds of millions of peace supporters is taking an increasingly active form. Dockworkers, porters, railway workers, sailors, and workers in various industries in France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, Britain, and other capitalist countries refuse to load or unload American war materials. The French authorities, following the orders of the United States, use military police to suppress peace supporters. But even the military police sent to disperse the demonstrators expressed sympathy for the peace supporters. The commentator pointed out: The new war instigators are terrified because their sinister plans are being massively opposed. But this is only the beginning. If the aggressors now have to expend so much energy to load and unload munitions, then if the imperialists dare to use these munitions, how much stronger a counterattack will they suffer from the people.

　　世界和平运动高涨
    和平签名与反“军援”巨流正汹涌澎湃
    战贩们因其罪恶阴谋遭反击深感恐慌
    【新华社二十日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：莫斯科各报本日刊载许多评论和平阵线日益强大的专文。巴宾在劳动报上撰文论述人民民主国家拥护和平运动的成就说：中欧与东南欧各国在以苏联为首的和平阵线中起着巨大的作用。他指出了城乡拥护和平委员会的数目日增。例如，保加利亚的拥护和平委员会已达三千多个，波兰有四千个，罗马尼亚参加和平运动的人数达七百万。巴宾写道：现在，在所有人民民主国家中，已发动了一个为和大常委会呼吁书征集签名的巨大运动。数以百万计的人民出席了在成百的城镇、成千的乡村中举行的群众大会。他们都一致在这一呼吁书上签名。
    消息报国际专栏作家写道：新战争挑拨者每天都看到亿万和平拥护者所进行的斗争，正采取着越来越积极的方式。法国、意大利、西德、比利时、英国及其他资本主义国家中的码头工人、搬运工人、铁路工人、海员以及各业工人，拒绝起卸或装运美国战争物资。法国当局遵照美国的命令，以军警镇压和平拥护者。但是连派去驱散示威者的军警，也对和平拥护者表示同情。评论员指出：新战争挑拨者因为他们的罪恶计划遭到大规模的反对而感到恐慌。但这还不过是开始。如果说现在侵略者为了起卸军火不得不费尽这样大的气力，那么假如帝国主义者胆敢使用这些军火，该遭受到人民比这个要强大多少的反击。
