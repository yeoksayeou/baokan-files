How Can Radio Stations Strengthen Their Connection with Listeners?
    Mei Yi

    How to strengthen the connection with listeners? This is the first and most urgent problem that radio workers encounter after moving from rural areas to cities. If this problem is solved, the radio station can be run well.
    To strengthen its connection with listeners, a radio station must have three conditions. The first is the radio station's own technical equipment. Now, the equipment of most people's stations (mainly city stations) can guarantee its connection with the broad masses of people. The second is the listening equipment of the masses. At present, very few basic masses have listening equipment. This problem is difficult to solve in the short term. However, we are taking measures such as assisting factories, institutions, schools, groups, and public places to purchase, improve, or replenish listening equipment, establishing listening groups, and organizing collective listening to initially solve the problem of mass listening. As long as the work of the radio station is done well and the masses feel that listening to the radio is a must, then they will find ways to solve their difficulties themselves. The third is the radio station's programming and organizational work. This issue has now become the key to whether radio stations can strengthen their connection with listeners and whether they can do their work well.
    Of the 49 radio stations currently existing in the country, 32 were established last year. Last year, most of the radio workers who entered China's major cities were empty-handed. They had no business preparation, and no experience in the programming and organizational work of city radio stations. Therefore, they took some detours in their work of connecting with listeners. The development of people's radio stations in various places has roughly the same pattern: in the beginning, most of them ran radio stations by using the methods of running newspapers. As a result, the content was dry, there was a lack of manuscripts, the work did not develop, the higher-ups did not pay attention, the cadres were uneasy, and they fell into a dilemma. Also, because they did not understand how to organize the masses, the circle of listeners was not large. However, each people's station, from the very first day, served the broad masses of people with its broadcasts, so it gained the support of the people and greatly facilitated its connection with listeners. After a period of exploration, the working methods of various people's stations finally changed. Editors and reporters walked out of the editorial office, and their connection with the masses became more extensive. Radio groups were organized, manuscripts had sources, and a considerable number of workers and students entered the broadcasting studio. Radio workers also gained confidence and promoted their work. Compared with the work in the previous stage, this was obviously a big step forward. According to incomplete statistics, the Shanghai People's Radio Station has organized 1,110 correspondents in the past six months, and 15,000 people have broadcast on the radio station. The Tianjin People's Radio Station organized 470 radio groups with 2,000 people, and 17,314 people broadcast on the radio station last year. The Beijing People's Radio Station now has a total of 52 radio groups and 428 correspondents. In the first three months of this year, a total of 2,224 people broadcast on the radio station. The Shenyang People's Radio Station organized 478 lectures, forums, etc. for employees, youth, and troops last year, organized 770 cultural and recreational programs, and 233 correspondents sent manuscripts to the radio station. There are now 29 people's radio stations across the country that have employee time, 27 stations that have youth time, and 25 stations that have established listener service programs.
    However, the connection between various people's stations and listeners is now undergoing further testing. The work of various people's stations in connecting with the masses has exposed some shortcomings: on the one hand, some programs of the radio stations themselves still cannot meet or cannot satisfy the requirements of the listeners; on the other hand, the organizational work of the radio stations, either because it is compulsory when organizing collective listening, or because it mixes organizing listeners with organizing broadcasting, or because when organizing radio groups, it takes advantage of the psychology of listeners who like to broadcast on the radio station, pursuing quantity and neglecting guidance work, demanding more and giving less; and some other shortcomings, as a result, some radio groups of several people's stations have now lost their function, some have become a burden on the masses, and some of those who used to like to participate in broadcasting are now less enthusiastic. Facts have proved that the connection between the people's radio stations and the listeners is still not solid and not close.
    In order to improve radio work and strengthen the connection between radio stations and the masses, we must take all necessary measures in both programming and organizational work. The following four are more important.
    First, our connection with the masses should mainly be a political connection. We should not be satisfied with broadcasting minor, purely technical social service manuscripts such as looking for people and finding jobs. Radio workers must always care about the interests of the masses, understand their demands, and make our programs more closely related to and reflect their daily lives and work. Radio workers must oppose empty political talk, but in their work, whenever possible, they should actively guide the interests of the masses to public life. We must let the activists among the broad masses of people use the radio station as a forum to actively express their opinions, spread their experiences, call for progress, and oppose backwardness for our common cause. We must let our labor heroes, model workers, and respected social figures use the radio station to tell their victories, report their experiences, make enthusiastic speeches on various important issues, and call on all the people to devote themselves to the country's construction cause. Radio workers should use concrete examples, vivid language, to enlighten class consciousness, cultivate patriotic enthusiasm, and enhance hostility towards the enemy, so that the broad masses of people can move forward along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Radio stations, especially city stations, should also become places for carrying out political encouragement, promoting urban construction, and exchanging production experiences. Only in this way can radio stations attract the attention of the broad masses of people and become a very active part of urban life. In the past, the practice of simply inviting radio groups to the radio station to make general broadcasts, or even only to participate in cultural and recreational performances, without selectively, in order to fill up the time, seemed to connect with the masses on the surface, but in fact it hindered the radio station from further establishing a connection with the masses. Because the content of these programs is mostly empty, generally not welcomed by the audience, and has no positive significance.
    Radio stations should have their own interview department to carry out their own interview work. Its interview activities should closely revolve around the center mentioned above, help the radio station obtain many clues, and organize the necessary broadcasts. Radio station reporters should not only conduct news interviews, let alone spend a lot of manpower to report some fragmented, technical issues that have little to do with the lives of the broad masses of people.
    We must cherish listeners' letters and handle them with a serious and responsible attitude. In this regard, our newspapers have more and more mature experience, and we should learn from newspapers. If there are often many listeners' letters, we can set up a program specifically for broadcasting important letters and broadcast the radio station's replies together.
    The above is one of the main methods to strengthen the connection with listeners. However, when implementing it, the radio station must make a planned and step-by-step arrangement according to its own cadre situation and working conditions. We must never be too hasty in dealing with more complex issues (especially issues related to criticism and self-criticism). If there are difficulties in manpower, the radio station can even temporarily transfer this type of problem to the local newspaper to handle, and concentrate its efforts to strengthen the work of general political connection.
    Second, we must run programs well, especially programs related to the main audience. Radio stations use programs to unite listeners. Programs should be organized according to the needs of the listeners. The most popular programs with listeners are also the programs that can make the radio station have the closest relationship with the broad masses of listeners. Each program should have a definite audience. No program can be loved by all listeners, and even news programs cannot have this kind of attraction. The main target of the radio station should be our basic masses, but it should also appropriately take care of the middle and upper class listeners who now own a large number of radios. When deciding and arranging programs, pay attention to this point, so that all aspects have programs they like to listen to, so that various listeners can hear the programs they love to listen to at the appropriate time. Once the program is scheduled, it must be widely publicized in order to win a large number of listeners. Unless absolutely necessary, do not change the program, so as not to make listeners work hard to find it. However, the radio station can reserve a small amount of time for flexible use to arrange some temporary programs. Programs should be of high quality rather than quantity. Do not arrange unnecessary programs just because you have some relatively readily available manuscripts, or in order to fill up the time, wasting funds and listeners' time. Anshan is our steel center, but the only lecture series on the Anshan radio station is a lecture series on plants. It is safe to believe that this will definitely not meet the general needs of miners. In order to run the program well, radio workers must often seek various clues from newspapers and documents, from meetings and reports, and from other materials that may be obtained, in order to deeply understand the ideological situation, work and life of the masses, and the problems existing in them. After sufficient investigation and research, we have full confidence to arrange our programs. Each of our programs may be adapted to the specific circumstances of the masses and meet their requirements; it is also possible to make our programs lively and interesting, with substantial content, and make people feel close to them after listening to them; it is also possible to make the radio have a kind of charm, so that people will listen to it as soon as they listen to it, and they want to listen to it again after listening to it, and they will feel lost if they do not listen to it one day.
    Third, the organizational work of each program should be carried out in coordination with the various relevant departments as much as possible. It is necessary to promote work through administration. In the current situation where listening tools are not yet widespread, it is difficult for radio stations to mobilize many people to listen without the assistance of the administrative authorities of various enterprises, institutions, groups, and schools, thus greatly reducing the role of broadcasting. The Beijing City Station's broadcast learning lecture series has received the full support of the Ministry of Education and the cooperation of the school authorities, and the effect is very significant, which is an example.
    Fourth, we must widely organize listeners, especially to organize listening groups among organized masses. We must take all possible methods to implement the decision of the News Agency to establish a radio network. With radio operators and listening groups, the radio station has a solid mass base, and can often get feedback from listeners, check its own work and improve its own work. We should separate the work of organizing listening and organizing broadcasting among the masses. It is not conducive to expanding the organization of listeners for a group to perform both the tasks of organizing listening and organizing broadcasting. The work of organizing listening should be more important than the work of organizing broadcasting. We should strive for the activists among the listeners to be radio operators and strengthen their connection with the radio station, so that they can become a bridge for the radio station to connect with the people. The task of radio operators and listening groups is to mobilize the masses to listen to certain programs of the radio station according to the needs of their units or groups (radio operators specially set up by government agencies, troops, schools, and mass organizations should also record various important news), and reflect their opinions to the radio station. Listening groups should be organized according to production, work units or living units. The so-called living unit refers to people who live together and have a common occupation, not the organization of districts and streets. The latter form of organization has been proven unsuitable in Tianjin. The number of people in the listening group should not be too large, generally 3-4 to 20-30 people is appropriate. The radio station should first concentrate its efforts to carry out the organization of listening groups among the main targets, and often contact them. It is necessary to hold symposiums or reporting meetings of radio operators (or listening group leaders) frequently or regularly to listen to their reflections and opinions. Before broadcasting important programs, in addition to vigorously publicizing them publicly, the radio station should also notify them of the time and content of important programs in a timely manner. The radio station should regard the listening leader as a bridge between it and the listeners, and provide various assistance as much as possible, including political education and technical guidance (such as the use and even repair of radio amplifiers), so that the radio operator can consciously and satisfactorily assume the task of organizing listening. It is necessary to check the work of the radio operators frequently, and pay special attention to whether they use administrative or other conveniences to make listening compulsory. Many experiences have proved that compulsory organizational work only makes listeners leave the listening group and increases the difficulty of future work. Regularly checking their listening equipment and helping them improve listening tools should also be listed as one of the daily tasks of the radio station.
    The above four items, the first two belong to programming work, and the last two belong to organizational work. In order to connect with the masses more closely, the radio station should also make its content simple and easy to understand; for various major issues, government instructions, and important news, the radio station should make popular explanations and explanations; it should broadcast in the local language; it should widely adopt recording, live recording forms, and literary and artistic forms loved by the local masses. In terms of entertainment programs, we should frequently invite or rebroadcast the performances of important literary and artistic groups and famous artists.
    Serving the broad masses of people with broadcasting and continuously strengthening its connection with listeners is a unique feature of the people's broadcasting industry. We people's radio workers should take the degree of connection between our cause and the masses as a measure of our work. Only by closely connecting with the masses can the people's broadcasting industry have a solid foundation and have the possibility of further development.

　　广播台如何加强与听众的联系？
    梅益
    如何加强与联众的联系？这是广播工作者由农村进入城市后，在工作中最先遇到的同时又是最迫切要求解决的问题。这个问题解决了，广播台就可以办得好。
    广播台要加强它与听众的联系，必须具备三项条件。第一是广播台本身的技术设备。现在大多数人民台（主要是市台）的设备，都可以保证它和广大人民的联系。第二是群众的收听设备。目前基本群众有收听设备的很少。这问题在短期内很难解决。但我们正采取协助工厂、机关、学校、团体和公共场所购置、改善或充实收听设备，成立收听小组，组织集体收听等办法，初步解决群众收听问题。只要广播台的工作做得好，群众觉得广播非听不可，那么他们自己是会设法解决他们的困难的。第三是广播台的编播工作与组织工作。这个问题，现在已成为各广播台能否加强它与听众联系和能否把工作做好的关键所在。
    全国现有的四十九座广播台中，有三十二座是在去年建立起来的。去年进入中国各大城市的广播工作者，几乎都是空手的。他们没有任何业务的准备，对城市广播台的编播工作和组织工作，毫无经验。因此他们在联系听众的工作上，也就走了一些弯路。各地人民广播电台的发展，有着大体相同的规律：开始时候，多数是以办报的方法来办广播台。结果是内容枯燥，稿件缺乏，工作不开展，上级不重视，干部不安心，陷入了进退两难的局面。又因为不懂怎样去组织群众，听众的圈子也不大。但是各人民台，由于它从最初一天起，就以其广播为广大人民服务，因此它就获得了人民的支持，并大大有利于它和听众的联系。经过一个时期的摸索之后，各人民台的工作方法终于有了改变。编辑与记者走出了编辑室，和群众的联系比较广泛了，广播小组组织起来了，稿件有了来源，相当数量的工人、学生走进了播音室。广播工作者也就获得了信心，推进了工作。和前一个阶段的工作比起来，这显然是进了一大步。根据不完全的统计，上海人民台半年来组织了一千一百十个通讯员，有一万五千人到广播台广播。天津人民台组织了二千人的四百七十个广播小组，去年一年就有一万七千三百十四人到电台广播。北京人民台现在一共有五十二个广播小组，通讯员四百二十八人，本年头三个月到电台广播的一共二千二百二十四人。沈阳人民台去年一年曾组织职工、青年、部队等讲演、座谈会等四百七十八次，组织文娱节目七百七十次，向广播台送稿的通讯员二百三十三人。全国现在有二十九个人民台办了职工时间，有二十七台办了青年时间，有二十五个台设立了听众服务的节目。
    但是，各人民台与听众的联系，现在正在经历进一步的考验。各人民台联系群众的工作，已暴露了一些缺点：一方面，是广播台本身还有一些节目，仍然不能符合或是不能满足听众的要求；另一方面，是广播台的组织工作，或者因为在组织集体收听时带强制性，或者把组织听众与组织广播混在一起，或者在组织广播小组的时候，利用了听众喜欢到广播台广播的心理，追求数量，忽视指导工作，要求的多给予的少；以及别的一些缺点，结果若干人民台的一些广播小组，现在已失去了作用，一部分则变成为群众的负担，过去喜欢参加广播的人，现在有一部分也不热心了。事实已证明了各人民广播电台与听众的联系，还是不巩固的和不密切的。
    为着改进广播工作，加强广播台与群众的联系，我们必须在编播业务和组织工作两方面，采取各种必要的办法。下面四项是比较重要的。
    第一、我们与群众的联系主要应该是政治的联系。我们不应该满足于播送寻人、找职业这一类次要的、纯技术性的社会服务稿件。广播工作者要时时刻刻关心群众的利益，懂得他们的要求，使我们的节目更能接近和反映他们的日常生活和工作。广播工作者要反对政治空谈，但是在工作中，只要有可能，就要主动地引导群众的兴趣到公共生活方面来。要让广大人民中的积极分子，利用广播台作为讲坛，为我们共同的事业，积极发表意见，传布经验，号召进步，反对落后。要让我们的劳动英雄、模范工作者、有威信的社会人物，利用广播台述说他们的胜利，报告他们的经验，发表他们对各项重要问题的热情演说，并号召全体人民献身国家的建设事业。广播工作者应该以具体的事例，生动的语言，以启发阶级觉悟，培养爱国热情，提高敌忾心理，使广大人民沿着毛主席指示的道路前进。广播台，特别是市台，还应该成为进行政治鼓励，推进城市建设和交流生产经验的场所。只有这样，广播台才能吸引广大人民的注意，并成为城市生活中非常活跃的一个部分。过去那种单纯为凑满时间，无选择地邀请广播小组到广播台作一般的广播，或甚至只参加文娱节目的演出，这些做法，在表面上好像联系了群众，而实际上却阻碍了广播台去进一步地建立与群众的联系。因为这些节目的内容大都很空洞，一般不为听众所欢迎，也没有积极的意义。
    广播台应有自己的采访部，进行自己的采访工作。它的采访活动，应该紧紧围绕着上面所说这个中心，帮助广播台得到许多线索，并组织必要的广播。广播台的记者不应当只进行新闻的采访，更不应当花费许多人力去报导一些零碎的，技术性的和与广大人民生活无甚关系的问题。
    要珍视听众的来信，要用严肃的和认真负责的态度去处理它。在这一方面，我们的报纸有较多的和较成熟的经验，应该向报纸学习。如果听众来信是经常多的，可以专门为播送重要的信件，设立一个节目，并把广播台的复信一同播出去。
    上面说的，是加强与听众的联系的主要方法之一。但是，在执行的时候，广播台还要根据它本身的干部情况与工作条件，作有计划有步骤的布置。处理比较复杂的问题（尤其是有关批评与自我批评的问题），决不应操之过急。如人力有困难，广播台甚至暂时可以把这一类问题转给当地的报纸去处理，而集中力量去加强一般性的政治联系的工作。
    第二、必须办好节目，特别是与主要听众有关的节目。广播台是以节目来团结听众的。应该根据听众的需要来组织节目。最受听众欢迎的节目，也正是能够使广播台与广大听众发生最密切关系的节目。每一个节目都应该有确定的听众。没有一种节目能得到一切听众的爱好，甚至就是新闻节目，也不可能有这种吸引力。广播台的主要对象，应该是我们的基本群众，但是又要适当照顾到现在拥有大量收音机的中上层听众。在决定和安排节目的时候，要注意这一点，使各方面都有他们爱听的节目，使各种听众都能在他合适的时间，听到他们所爱听的节目。节目一经排定，就要进行广泛的宣传，以争取大量的听众。节目非不得已，不要变动，免得听众费力去寻找。但是广播台可以保留一小部分时间，以便机动使用，来安排一些临时节目。节目宁缺勿滥，不要因为有了某些比较现成的稿件，或是为了填满时间，而安排了不必要的节目，浪费了经费和听众的时间。鞍山是我们的钢铁中心，但是鞍山广播台唯一的一个讲座，却是植物讲座。可以相信，这决不会符合矿工普遍的需要。为了要办好节目，广播工作者必须经常从报纸与文件中，从会议和报告中，以及从其他各种可能得到的材料中，去寻觅种种线索，以深入了解群众的思想情况、工作和生活情况以及其中存在着的问题。有了充分的调查研究之后，我们就有充分的把握，来安排我们的节目。我们的每个节目，就有可能与群众的具体情况相适应，与他们的要求相符合；也有可能使我们的节目，办得生动活泼，言之有物，叫人听了觉得亲切；也有可能使广播具有一种魅力，使人一听，就听下去，听后就想再听，有一天不听，就恍然若有所失。
    第三、每个节目的组织工作，要尽可能地与各个有关部门，配合进行。必须通过行政，推动工作。在目前收听工具还不普遍的情况下，广播台不通过各企业、机关、团体、学校的行政当局，争取他们的协助，就很难动员许多的人来收听，因而大大减低了广播的作用。北京市台的广播学习讲座得到教育部的全力支持和各学校当局的配合，收效很大，就是一例。
    第四、要广泛地去组织听众，特别是要在有组织的群众中组织收听小组。要采取各种可能的方法，去实现新闻总署所公布的关于建立广播收音网的决定。广播台有了收音员和收听小组，就有了确实的群众基础，就可以经常得到听众的反映，检查自己的工作和改进自己的工作。应该把在群众中组织收听和组织广播的工作分开。一个小组兼负组织收听与组织广播两种任务，这种作法，对扩大组织听众是不利的。组织收听的工作，应较比组织广播的工作更重要。应该争取听众中的积极分子，作为收音员，并且加强他们与广播台的联系，使之成为广播台联系人民群众的桥梁。收音员和收听小组的任务，是按照它所属单位或小组本身的需要，动员群众收听广播台的一定节目（政府机关、部队、学校和群众团体专设的收音员，还要记录各种重要新闻），并把他们的意见反映给广播台。收听小组应该按生产、工作单位或是生活单位组织。所谓生活单位，是指生活在一起的有共同的职业的人们，而不是指区街的组织。后一种组织形式，在天津已证明为不合宜的。收听小组的人数不应太多，一般以三四人至二三十人为合适。广播台应该首先集中力量，在主要对象中间，开展收听小组的组织，并经常与它们取得联系。必须经常地或是定期地举行收音员（或称收听小组干事）的座谈会或汇报会，倾听他们的反映和意见。广播台在播送重要节目之前，除了大力作公开的宣传而外，还要把重要节目的时间和内容，及时通知他们。广播台应该把收听干事看作为它与听众的桥梁，而尽量给予各种帮助，包括政治上的教育和技术的指导（例如收音机扩音器的使用以至修理），以便收音员能自觉和胜任愉快地担负组织收听的工作。要经常检查收音员的工作，特别要注意他们是否利用行政或其他的便利，使收听带强迫性。许多经验证明了，带强迫性的组织工作，只有使听众离开收听小组，并且增加了今后工作的困难。经常检查他们的收听设备，帮助他们改进收听工具，也应列为广播台的日常工作之一。
    上述四项，前两项是属于编播工作的，后两项是属于组织工作的。为着更密切地去联系群众，广播台还应该使它的内容浅显通俗，简单明了；各种重大问题，政府指令，以及重要新闻，广播台应作通俗的解释和说明；应该以当地的语言播音；应该广泛采用录音、实况录音的形式，和为当地群众所喜爱的文艺形式。在娱乐节目方面，要经常邀请或转播重要文艺团体与著名艺人的演奏。
    以广播为广大人民服务，并不断加强它与听众的联系，是人民广播事业所独有的特点。我们人民广播工作者，应该把我们的事业与群众联系的程度，作为衡量我们的工作的尺度。只有密切地联系了群众，人民广播事业才有坚固的基础，才有进一步发展的可能。
