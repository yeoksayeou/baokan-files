　　Driving Western European Countries to Fight for U.S. Imperialism
　　North Atlantic Aggression Group Formulates Comprehensive War Preparedness Plan
　　[Xinhua News Agency, April 4th] The third meeting of the "Defense Committee" of the North Atlantic Treaty aggression group was held in The Hague on April 1st, personally presided over by U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson. This is the last in a series of war preparation meetings held by the North Atlantic Group recently. This meeting, like previous ones, was kept completely secret. Only a communique was issued after the meeting, announcing that the meeting had approved a comprehensive war preparedness plan called the Collective Defense Plan, passed by the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee on March 24th. Thus, U.S. imperialism has completed another step in preparing for a war of aggression and further controlling its vassal states. This so-called "Collective Defense Plan" is intended to drive Western European countries to fight for U.S. imperialism. According to a report by the United Press International from The Hague on the 1st, citing so-called well-informed sources, in the event of launching a war of aggression, "the United States is designated to undertake long-range strategic bombing missions, while Britain and the Netherlands are responsible for maintaining very important maritime communications, and European countries are responsible for supplying manpower..." The communique issued after the "Defense Committee" meeting carefully concealed the serious contradictions that arose in the series of meetings due to U.S. imperialism forcing its vassal states to become its barracks and arsenals. However, according to TASS, citing Dutch newspaper reports, the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty frequently argued at the Hague meeting. Representatives of the Netherlands, France, and other Western European countries expressed dissatisfaction with the demands of U.S. generals to greatly expand the armed forces of their respective countries. The Dutch newspapers *De Waarheid*, *Het Volk*, *De Telegraaf*, and others pointed out that the Hague meeting required a significant expansion of the land and air forces of Western European countries, as a result, these countries would have to greatly increase their military expenditures. The social democratic newspaper *Het Parool* also believes that the Netherlands has been assigned to build a large number of fighters and light bombers, and this plan can only be completed at a huge economic sacrifice. The official Dutch news agency ANP admitted that the Americans demanded that the Dutch government bear the cost of building new munitions factories and retool a portion of peaceful industry for military production.
　　In addition, contradictions have arisen among the North Atlantic Group in the competition for the arms market. The Dutch newspaper *De Waarheid* pointed out that, according to the decisions of the Hague meeting, the Netherlands must purchase aircraft from the United States, thereby causing fierce dissatisfaction from the British side, which is attempting to sell its aircraft in the Netherlands.
　　Therefore, the aggressive war preparation plan, which the communique boasts as having been "unanimously approved by the defense ministers of the twelve countries," is actually built on a foundation full of contradictions and highly unstable.
　　According to Associated Press and United Press International reports, the "Defense Committee" meeting discussed the issue of having Franco's Spain join the North Atlantic Treaty aggression group as an air base, and also discussed the status of the puppet West German government in a war of aggression.

### 驱使西欧各国为美帝打仗  北大西洋侵略集团拟订全面备战计划

　　驱使西欧各国为美帝打仗
    北大西洋侵略集团  拟订全面备战计划
    【新华社四日讯】北大西洋公约侵略集团的“防务委员会”第三次会议，在美国国防部长詹森亲自主持下，于四月一日在海牙举行。这是北大西洋集团最近以来举行的一连串备战会议中的最后一个。这次会议也如以前各次会议一样，保守完全秘密，仅会后发表公报，宣布会议已批准北大西洋公约军事委员会于三月二十四日通过的名为集体防御计划的全面备战计划。至此，美帝国主义已完成准备侵略战争与进一步控制其仆从国家的又一步骤。这个所谓“集体防御计划”，就是要驱使西欧各国替美帝国主义去打仗。据合众社海牙一日电引所谓消息灵通人士透露：在一旦发动侵略战争时，“美国被指定担任长距离战略轰炸任务，而由英国与荷兰担负维持很重要的海上交通的责任，欧洲国家则负责供给人力……”。“防务委员会”会后所发表的公报，曾小心地掩饰住在这一连串会议中，美帝国主义因为强迫变其仆从国家为其兵营与兵工厂而发生的严重矛盾，但据塔斯社引荷兰报纸消息称：北大西洋公约签字国在海牙会议上经常发生争论，荷兰、法国及其他西欧国家的代表们对于美国将军们想大量扩充各该国武装的要求，表示不满。荷兰《真理报》、《人民报》、《电讯报》等指出：海牙会议要求大大扩充西欧国家的陆空军，结果，这些国家便必须大大增加军费的开支。社会民主党的派洛尔报亦认为：荷兰已被指派建立大量的战斗机与轻轰炸机，而这种计划只能在付出巨大的经济牺牲后，才能完成。荷兰官方的安普通讯社承认：美国人要求荷兰政府负担建立新的军火工厂的费用，并再改装一部分和平工业从事军事生产。
    此外，北大西洋集团间在军火市场的争夺上，也发生了矛盾。荷兰《真理报》指出，按照海牙会议的决定，荷兰必须从美国购买飞机，从而引起了企图在荷兰推销其飞机的英国方面的激烈不满。
    因此，公报所吹嘘的“十二国国防部长一致通过的”这一侵略备战计划，实际上是建立在充满矛盾而非常不稳的基础上。
    据美联社与合众社消息：“防务委员会”会议曾讨论了使佛朗哥西班牙参加北大西洋公约侵略集团作为空军基地的问题，也讨论了傀儡的西德政府在侵略战争中地位的问题。
