　　Italian Communist Party Holds Central Plenary Session
    Will Present New Positive Policies to the Country
    Party Membership Soars, Total Exceeds 2.5 Million
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 16th] According to a report from the Telegraphic Communication Agency in Rome: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) began its plenary session in Rome on the 12th. The main agenda of the meeting was to hear and discuss the report by PCI Central Committee member, Scotto Mauro, on "Struggling for New Policies of Work, Freedom, and Peace."

    PCI Deputy General Secretary, Secchia, delivered a speech at the meeting stating: Currently, the total number of Italian Communist Party members and Italian Communist Youth Federation members combined has exceeded 2.5 million, an unprecedented figure in the history of the Italian Communist Party. The Italian Communist Party "has never been so strong and so tightly organized. This is not only true in terms of numbers, but also in terms of the quality of cadres and the party's working ability." Secchia emphatically pointed out: This leap in the party's development occurred precisely during a period of "intense, acute, and difficult struggle."

    Before the opening of the Central Plenary Session, PCI General Secretary Togliatti gave an interview on the 10th to the Rome democratic newspaper, "National Evening News," stating: The Italian Communist Party has never been as strong and efficient as it is today. This new strength and efficiency is evident not only in the number of members, but also in the surge of party organizational activities. Togliatti attributed this to "the increasing combativeness of the masses of workers in the South and the North." When discussing the work of the PCI Central Plenary Session, Togliatti declared: The Central Committee's discussions will not be limited to those new unconstitutional decrees and plans to fight against them; on the contrary, it will focus on studying "new positive policies that the working masses are presenting to the country as a path to salvation."

　　意共举行中央全会
    将向全国指出新的积极政策
    党团员飞跃发展总数超过二百五十万
    【新华社十六日讯】据电通社罗马消息：意大利共产党中央委员会于十二日起在罗马举行全会。会议的主要议程是听取并讨论意共中央委员斯科西马罗关于“为争取新的工作、自由与和平政策而斗争”的报告。
    意共副总书记谢嘉在会上发表演说称：现在，意大利共产党党员和意大利共产主义青年团团员合计，总数已经超过二百五十万人，这是意大利共产党历史上空前的数字。意大利共产党“从来没有这样强大和组织得这样严密。这不仅从数量上看是如此，就是从干部的素质和党的工作能力上来看，也是如此”。谢嘉并着重地指出：党的这一飞跃发展，恰是在一个“激烈、尖锐、困难的斗争”时期中发生的。
    在中央全会开幕之前，意共总书记托里亚蒂曾于十日向罗马民主报纸“国家晚报”记者发表谈话称：意大利共产党从未像今天这样的坚强和有效率。这个新的力量与效率，不但在党员的数目上是如此，同时，在党组织活动的激增上也是如此。托里亚蒂将这归因于“南方以及北方工人群众战斗性的日益增长”。在论及意共中央全会的工作时，托里亚蒂宣称：中央委员会的讨论，将不限于那些新的违反宪法的法令以及和它们斗争的计划，相反，它将集中于研究“新的积极方面的政策，这种政策是工人群众作为走向得救的道路而向全国提出的”。
