Following the adjournment of the joint conference of Youth League Work Committee secretaries from various regions, convened by the National Railway Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, on January 26th, the regional Youth League Work Committees have successively convened cadre meetings upon their return to deploy work based on the decisions of the joint conference. The Northeast Railway Youth League Work Committee plans to train 7,159 young technical workers this year, striving for 30% to 40% of the League members to become "Iron Ox Team members" (Iron Ox Team members are the title of model workers of the Northeast Railway - Editor), and is scheduled to convene a production and education ministers' conference of its affiliated Youth League Work Committees in April to exchange experiences from various regions. In terms of organizational work, specific work plans have been put forward based on the development and consolidation of the League in old and new areas, respectively, making active development on the basis of consolidation. The Qiqihar Railway Youth League Work Committee plans to cultivate and promote 58 branch secretaries, 20 general branch and sub-general branch secretaries and committee members, and 11 branch committee secretaries and committee members this year; and plans to train 4,660 League members and 723 group leaders in 18 phases. In terms of propaganda and education work, it is planned to complete the investigation of the cultural level of all League members before mid-March, so that they can participate in cultural remedial schools in separate classes; political education will be carried out under the unified leadership of the Political Department, with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to be completed in the first half of the year, and the study of historical materialism to begin in the second half of the year.
    The Tianjin Railway Youth League Work Committee plans to organize 3,420 young workers to sign apprenticeship contracts this year; strive to organize 5,200 young workers to enter spare-time remedial schools, and raise more than 640 illiterate League members to a level where they can recognize more than 500 characters; the annual plan is to conduct short-term training for 800 League members and cadres, accounting for one-tenth of all young workers.
    Yangquan already has a general branch of the League that plans to train 28 young technical workers this year.
    The Hengyang Railway Youth League Work Committee has also made plans to strive to establish two railway branch committees in Guangzhou and Liuzhou and railway branch organizations in Guilin, Shaoguan, Hengxi, Liuxian, Zhuzhou Machine Factory and other places by the end of March, and strive to expand the above-mentioned branch organizations into general branch organizations between April and May; in other areas with more than 300 young workers, strive to establish branch organizations in June.
    At the same time, the Railway Youth League Work Committees in various regions are going deeper into the field, seizing typical examples, and drawing on work experience. For example, the Taiyuan Railway Youth League Work Committee has gone to Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan to work, focusing on the locomotive and rolling stock departments. The secretary of the Shijiazhuang Railway Branch Committee went to the vehicle inspection section to carry out technical learning, and the organization committee member went to the locomotive section to lead the driving branch work. The Railway Youth League Work Committees in Zhengzhou and Tianjin, the Shenyang Railway Youth League Work Committee and Branch Committee, and the Andong and Changchun Railway Branch Committees have also gone to the field one after another to carry out work with emphasis.

　　东北、天津铁路团工委
    计划培养万余青年技工
    【本报讯】青年团全国铁道工作委员会召开的各地团工委书记联席会议于一月二十六日闭幕后，各地团工委回去后已先后召开干部会议，根据联席会议的决定，布置工作。东北铁路团工委计划在今年内培养七千一百五十九名青年技术工人，争取百分之三十到四十的团员成为“铁牛队员”（铁牛队员是东北铁路模范工作者的称号——编者），并定于四月间召开所属各团工委的生产教育部长会议，交流各地经验。在组织工作上，则分别新老地区团的发展与巩固情况，提出了具体工作方案，在巩固的基础上作积极的发展。齐齐哈尔铁路团工委计划本年度内培养提拔支部书记五十八名，总支与分总支书记、委员共二十名，分委书记、委员共十一名；并计划分十八期轮训团员四千六百六十名，小组长七百二十三名。在宣教工作上，计划三月中旬以前完成所有团员文化程度的调查，以便分班参加文化补习学校学习；政治教育则在政治部的统一领导下，上半年学完人民政协共同纲领，下半年开始学唯物史观。
    天津铁路团工委计划今年组织三千四百二十名青年工人订师徒合同；争取组织五千二百名青年工人入业余补习学校，并把六百四十余名文盲团员提高到认识五百个字以上；全年计划短期轮训团员及干部八百名，占全体青年工人的十分之一。
    阳泉已有一个团的总支部计划在本年内培养二十八名技术青工。
    衡阳铁路团工委亦作出计划，争取在三月底建立广州和柳州的两个铁路分团委以及桂林、韶关、衡西、柳县、株州机厂等地的铁路团支部，并争取将上述支部在四月至五月间扩大为总支部；其他有三百名青工以上地区，亦争取在六月间都成立支部。
    同时，各地铁路团工委更深入现场，抓住典型，吸取工作经验。如太原铁路团工委已分赴石家庄、太原两地工作，并以机务、车务为重点。石家庄铁路分团委书记到检车段开展技术学习，组织委员到机务段领导行车支部工作。郑州、天津两地铁路团工委，沈阳铁路团工委、分团委及安东、长春铁路分团委也先后到现场，有重点地进行工作。
