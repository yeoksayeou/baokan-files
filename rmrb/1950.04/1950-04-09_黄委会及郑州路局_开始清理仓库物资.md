Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 6th:

　　The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau of the Longhai Railway have begun clearing warehouse materials.

　　The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission established a Warehouse Materials Clearing and Investigation Committee on March 25th. It instructed the river affairs management organizations in various provinces to quickly organize sub-committees to conscientiously carry out material clearing. It stipulated that all self-purchased or received warehouse materials are within the scope of the investigation, and the clearing must be completed before April 13th. The inspection team established under the Clearing and Investigation Committee went to Pingyuan, Shandong and other places on March 27th to inspect the work.

　　The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau is planning to solve part of the material supply problems in this year's railway construction by clearing inventory, collecting lost materials, and utilizing waste materials. Because a large number of materials received from the enemy and puppets are scattered in factories and warehouses along the line, they have not yet been cleared. At the end of last year, the Xi'an Branch initially cleared old materials from various units, equivalent to 3,500 bags of flour. In the collection of materials scattered among the people along the way, there were more than 70,000 steel rails alone. After the establishment of the Waste Material Repair Institute at the end of last year, 557 finished products such as scales and ticket punching machines were manufactured using waste materials. The Xuzhou section saved more than 134 million yuan (People's Currency) by utilizing waste materials. In view of these situations, the bureau convened a meeting on material supply in mid-March, and decided to immediately establish inventory organizations at all levels along the entire line, with a deadline for completing the inventory from April 15th to June 15th. The work of collecting lost materials will be completed before April 15th. The bureau also decided to launch a mass movement of "waste material turnaround, dead material revival" throughout the entire line, and reward exemplary employees who have contributed to the utilization of waste materials.

　　黄委会及郑州路局
    开始清理仓库物资
    【新华社汉口六日电】黄河水利委员会及陇海铁路郑州区铁路管理局已开始清理仓库物资。
    黄河水利委员会于上月二十五日成立了仓库器材清理调查委员会，并指令各省河务管理机构迅速组织分会，认真进行物资清理，规定一切自购或接收的仓库器材均在清查范围之内，并限四月十三日以前清查完竣。清理调查委员会下所设之检查组已于三月二十七日前赴平原、山东等地检查工作。
    郑州区铁路管理局正拟从清理库存搜集遗散器材及利用废料、废物等方面，解决该局今年铁路建设中的一部分材料供应问题。因为该局所接收的敌伪大批器材，大部都散存在沿路各段厂库中，迄今未曾清理。去年底西安分局初步清理出各单位的旧料折合面粉达三千五百袋；在搜集散存沿途民间的器材中，仅钢轨一项就有七万余根；去年底成立了废料整修所后，利用废料制造了磅秤、轧票机等成品五百五十七件。徐州段则因利用废料而节省了人民币一亿三千四百多万元。鉴于这些情况，该局特于上月中旬召开了全局材料供应会议，决定立即成立全路各级清点机构，限期四月十五日到六月十五日内完成清点工作。搜集遗散器材的工作则争取在四月十五日以前完成。该局并决定在全路展开群众性的“废料翻身、死料复活”运动，奖励利用废料有功的模范员工。
