　　Anyang Post Office Proposes Guarantee to Shorten Newspaper Delivery Time

    [Our Newspaper] Since March 1st, when the distribution of this newspaper was uniformly handled by the Postal Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Anyang City Post Office, in order to ensure that readers can see the newspaper as soon as possible, has put forward three guarantees for improving work efficiency in the second quarter work plan: 1. Guarantee that the newspaper will not remain in the post office for even one minute and will be delivered overnight. Readers will be able to read the newspaper one day earlier than before, and can see it the day after it is published. 2. Guarantee to pay on time and implement the subscription system. 3. Guarantee to conduct regular inspections and listen to readers' opinions in the future. (Chen Shuanglu)
