　　Five Factories in the Xian Nong Tan District Cooperatively Establish a Joint Spare-Time School
    [This Newspaper's News] The Automobile Repair Factory, Tianqiao Clothing Factory, Agricultural Machinery Factories No. 1 and No. 2, and the Xin Jian Ice Factory in the Xian Nong Tan District of this city have jointly established a joint spare-time school. This has resolved the various difficulties that arose when each factory tried to establish its own spare-time school, such as the shortage of teachers, funds, and suitable locations. This has enabled more than 300 workers to study more effectively. In the past, various learning organizations, such as cultural, technical, and Russian language groups, were established in each factory. However, because the teachers were mostly part-time, classes were often delayed or changed due to unforeseen circumstances, and the learning organizations became merely symbolic. To formally establish a spare-time school, each factory faced some difficulties that could not be resolved due to objective limitations. For example, the Ice Factory only had more than 20 employees and could not afford to establish one on its own. Cadres from the Municipal Spare-Time Education Committee learned about the above situation in the Xian Nong Tan District and immediately helped the factories to jointly prepare for the establishment of a joint spare-time school. They worked with the responsible cadres of each factory to formulate the "Implementation Plan for the Xian Nong Tan District Five-Factory Joint Spare-Time School." After more than a month of preparation, they found a school site in the central area of the five factories that could accommodate 400 people for classes. They resolved the funding problem by extracting a portion of the cultural and educational expenses from each factory and hired two full-time teachers (in addition to some part-time teachers). Based on the different specific conditions of each factory, they determined a unified study time. The school has now been open for three weeks, and more than 400 workers are participating in the studies. (Xu Hongyan)

　　先农坛区五厂合作创办联合业余学校
    【本报讯】本市先农坛区汽车修配厂、天桥被服厂、农业机械一、二分厂、新建制冰厂等五个工厂成立联合业余学校，解决了在各厂单独成立业余学校时所发生的教员、经费、地址等各种困难，使三百余工人得以更好的进行学习。过去各厂曾成立过文化、技术、俄文等各种学习组织，因教员多是兼职，经常耽误教课或因事变动，学习组织流于形式。要正式成立业余学校，各厂因客观条件限制，有些困难无法解决，像制冰厂只有二十多个职工，自己根本无力成立。市业余教育委员会干部到先农坛区了解到以上情况，即帮助各厂共同筹办联合业余学校，和各厂负责干部共同制定了“先农坛区五厂联合业余学校实施方案”，经过月余的筹备，在五厂中心地区觅得可容四百人上课的校址，由各厂文教费中提取一部分解决了经费问题，聘定了两个专任教员（另有一些兼职教员），并根据各厂不同的具体情况，确定了统一的学习时间。现已开学三星期，共有四百多工人参加学习。（许鸿燕）
