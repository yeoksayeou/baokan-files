Brief Reply to Comrade Hou Yanliang:

　　Your letter regarding the "Mid-way Change of Enrollment Quotas for Trainees and Apprentices at the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot" has been received. Previously, this bureau issued a general notice to all stations and depots to recruit new personnel. However, while we were in the process of carrying out this work, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Northeast Railway Administration issued a "Suspension of Hiring Personnel" decision based on the national financial situation. Therefore, based on the specific situation of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and with the approval of the General Administration, the original plan to recruit 300 people at the depot was reduced to 122, hence the change and reduction in quotas.

　　简复侯雁良君：
    你的“山海关机务段招考练习生、学徒工中途变更名额”的信已收到。本局前曾通令各站段招收新人。但我们正在办理这工作时，中央人民政府铁道部及东北铁路总局又根据全国财经情况颁布了“停止用人”的决定。因此我们根据锦局具体情况，请示总局同意后，将该段原拟录用三○○名的计划改缩为一二二名，故而名额变更减少。
