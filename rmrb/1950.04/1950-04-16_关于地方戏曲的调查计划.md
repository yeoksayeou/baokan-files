　　Investigation Plan on Local Operas
    Cheng Yanqiu
    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhou Yang forwarded a letter from Mr. Cheng Yanqiu. In this letter, Mr. Cheng Yanqiu explained the term "direct realism method" mentioned in his "Short Visit to Northwest Opera" (published in this journal on February 26th), and put forward a general outline of a plan to investigate local operas across the country. We believe this plan can be used as a reference for opera reform workers in various regions and is specially published.

Comrade Zhou Yang:
    Thank you for your letter of February 27th and your sincere advice!

    There is one thing I should explain to you. In "Short Visit to Northwest Opera," the "direct realism method" I mentioned does not refer to the method of spoken drama. Although spoken drama is closer to the truth than old opera, everything in it has undergone artistic processing. Some people in the old opera rigidly apply the word "realism," thinking that realism should be reality. Thus, on the stage, the fire must be real fire, the rain must be real rain, and a live cow is brought on stage to steal the show. This is just a trick, not art. I think it is wrong. (Of course, in movies, it's another matter.)

    You said that old opera should not refuse to learn from brother arts such as spoken drama and movies, and I very much agree with this. Analyzing old opera from its history, it has been learning and absorbing from various brother arts for many years, which has led to today. Why should we close ourselves off now? However, when learning and having insights, we must absorb it in an integrated way. Otherwise, swallowing it whole will inevitably lead to the errors mentioned above. To prevent this kind of error, I think it is best to add the three words "profoundly" above the two words "learning." At the same time, we must also profoundly and objectively review and study our own art.

    I am almost fifty years old, and my future on the stage is not very long. But having been engaged in the drama business for half my life, I should of course continue to work in the drama field. I have thoroughly reviewed myself. Because I have always focused on performing techniques, I am not good at administrative work. Forcing myself to do it will only lead to mistakes. In the past, I had a plan to investigate local operas across the country, with the aim of discovering and collecting as much as possible of our nation's traditional drama arts, for research, selection, and adoption in the work of improving old opera. There are many kinds of local operas across the country, but the relationships between them are also very deep, and therefore there are many similarities. If we compare and study them with Peking opera, the investigation can be less time-consuming and more effective. So, I think that carrying out this plan again may not be entirely without results. But this is just what I think. I also hope you can give me correct guidance. Now I am recording the general outline of my investigation plan below. Please correct it!

    General Outline of National Opera Investigation Plan

    I. In order to conduct a unified investigation of local operas across the country, collect them, compare and study them, statistically organize them, and use them as basic materials for building new Chinese opera, a national opera investigation group will be organized to carry out this work.

    II. According to the system of local operas and the convenience of travel, the whole country is roughly divided into twelve regions:

    1. Central and Northern Shaanxi and Gansu and Ningxia. 2. Southern Shaanxi, Southwestern Henan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. 3. Xinjiang and Qinghai. 4. Xikang and Tibet. 5. Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. 6. Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan. 7. Jiangxi and Southern Anhui. 8. Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu. 9. Northeastern Henan, Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Southern Hebei. 10. Shanxi and Central and Northern Hebei. 11. Various parts of Inner Mongolia. 12. Northeast.

    III. The steps and procedures of the investigation: The first step is to compare and record the current situation by category. The main points that should be noted are twelve items:

    1. Costumes 2. Props 3. Makeup 4. Acting skills 5. Music 6. Scripts 7. Organization 8. Life 9. Performance conditions 10. Teaching methods 11. Distribution area 12. Other.

    The second step is to investigate its origins and changes, and the relationship between it and other local operas.

    The third step is to seek out historical traces of its past activities and related objects, such as books, texts, stone carvings, and statues.

    IV. Recording methods: According to individual circumstances, the following methods are used to record separately:

    1. Text. 2. Musical score. 3. Photography. 4. Film. 5. Sound recording. 6. Model, rubbing. 7. Illustration. 8. Chart.

    Special and small items can be collected as physical objects.

    V. Equipment to be prepared is as follows:

    1. One movie camera (8mm sound). 2. One tape recorder (wire type). 3. Two cameras (one large and one small). 4. One set of drawing tools (with watercolors and oil paints). 5. Various papers. 6. Stationery.

    VI. The staff should have the following skills:

    1. One person who can shoot movies, take pictures, and repair and use tape recorders. 2. One person who can draw, make charts, rub stone carvings, and make models. 3. One person who can take shorthand. 4. One person who can write music scores and has research on Chinese music, especially stage music. 5. One person who has research on Chinese drama history and music history. 6. One or two people who are proficient in all aspects of Chinese drama performance techniques. 7. One or two people who have research on costumes, makeup, and props. 8. One person who has experience in organization and teaching.

    VII. In order to simplify this group, it is best to organize a troupe at the same time and set off together. In this way, most of the staff can be placed in the troupe, saving at least one-half of the expenses.

    VIII. The materials obtained from the investigation, in addition to being used to enrich the opera museum library, can also become the following works:

    1. General Records of National Operas (including a series of several units); 2. Chinese Opera Encyclopedia (dictionary and encyclopedia-style class book); 3. History of Chinese Drama; 4. History of Chinese Music; 5. History of Chinese Songs.

    The above are what we have thought of. Of course, this is very insufficient. I hope you will give me more supplementary opinions. (The following is omitted.)

### 关于地方戏曲的调查计划

　　关于地方戏曲的调查计划
    程砚秋
    编者按：周扬同志转来程砚秋先生的一封信，在这封信里程砚秋先生对他所作的《西北戏曲访问小记》（载二月二十六日本刊）中所说的“直接写实方法”一语有所解释，并提出了一个调查全国地方戏曲的计划大纲。这个计划我们认为可供各地戏曲改革工作者的参考，特为发表。周扬先生：
    读过您二月二十七的信，承恳切指教，敬谢！
    有一件事应该向您解释的，在《西北戏曲访问小记》中，我所说的“直接写实方法”，并不是指话剧手法来讲，话剧虽比较旧剧近真，但他的一切，也都是经过一番艺术处理的。旧剧中有些人，死板地运用了“写实”两字，以为写实便该是实，于是在舞台上，火要真烧，雨要真下，活牛上台，当场出彩，这只是把戏而不是艺术了，我觉得是错误的。（自然、在电影中、又当别论。）
    您说旧剧不应该拒绝向话剧、电影等兄弟艺术学习，这话我很赞成，旧剧从他的历史来分析，也是积年累月，不断地向各兄弟艺术学习吸收，才有了今日，我们现在为什么反要闭门自封呢？不过学习而有所见的时候，必需要融会地来吸收，否则生吞活剥，一定不免像上面所说到的错误。要防止这种错误，我以为在学习两字之上，最好再加“深刻地”三字，同时对于自己本身的艺术，也要深刻地客观的检讨研究。
    我是将近五十的人了，舞台上的前途，已然不很久远，但半生从事戏剧事业，当然此后还应该站在戏剧的岗位上去工作。我曾经详细检讨我自己，由于一向只是在表演技术上用心，对于事务工作，深非所长，勉强从事，只有误事。过去我曾有一个调查全国各地方戏曲的计划，目的是把我们民族传统的各种戏剧艺术，尽量的发掘搜集起来，来供改进旧剧工作的研究选择采用。全国各种地方戏曲，数目是很多的，但相互之间关系也很深，因而相同之点也很多。我们以京剧去和他们作比较的研究，调查起来是可以费事少而收效快的。所以我觉得再把这计划实行起来，或者不致太无成绩。但是这只我自己觉得如此，还希望您给我一个正确的指导。现在把我的调查计划大纲录在下面，请教正！
    全国戏曲调查计划大纲
    一、为了把全国各地方的戏曲，作统一的调查，汇集起来，比较研究，统计整理，以为建设新中国歌剧的基本材料，组织全国戏曲调查团来进行这项工作。
    二、全国各地，依地方戏的系统和旅程的方便，粗分作十二个区域：
    １陕西中部北部和甘肃宁夏。２陕南、豫西南、四川、湖北、湖南。３新疆、青海。４西康、西藏。５云贵、广西。６广东、福建、台湾。７江西和皖南。８浙江和江苏南部。９河南东北部、皖北、苏北、山东、河北南部。１０山西、河北中部北部。１１内蒙各地。１２东北。
    三、调查的步骤和程序，第一步先就现况分门别类去比较，记录，应该注意的主要有十二项：
    １服装２道具３化装４演技５音乐６剧本７组织８生活９演剧情况１０教学方法１１分布区域１２其他。
    第二步调查他的来源和变迁，及与其他地方戏相互之间的关系。
    第三步访求他过去活动的史迹，和有关的事物，如图书文字石刻造像之类。
    四、记录方法，按照各别情形，分别用下列几种方式来记录：
    １、文字。２、乐谱。３、照像。４、电影。５、录音。６、模型、拓片。７、图绘。８、图表。
    特殊而小件的东西，可以采集实物。
    五、应备的工具，如下：
    １、电影机一具（八米厘有声的）２、录音机一具（钢丝式的）。３、照像机二具（大小各一）。４、绘图用具一份（附水彩油彩）。５、各种纸张。６、文具。
    六、工作人员的配备，应具有下列各种技能的人员：
    １、能拍电影，能照像，兼能修理运用录音机的一人。２、能绘画，制图表，拓石刻，造模型的一人。３、能速记的一人。４、能记乐谱并对于中国音乐，特别是场面乐有研究的一人。５、对中国戏剧史音乐史有研究的一人。６、对中国戏剧表演技术各门均通的一、二人。７、对服装化妆道具有研究的一、二人。８、对于组织和教学有经验的一人。
    七、为求这团体简便，最好同时组织一个剧团，相偕出发，这样可以把大部分的工作人员寄在剧团里，省低经费至少二分之一以上。
    八、调查所得的材料，除用以充实戏曲博物馆图书馆外，并可成为下列几种著作：
    １、全国戏曲总志（包括若干单位的一个丛书）；２、中国戏曲通典（辞典及百科全书式的类书）；３、中国戏剧史；４、中国音乐史；５、中国歌曲史。
    以上的几项，是我们所想到的，当然这很不足，希望您多多指示些补充的意见。（下略）
                                                程砚秋
                                            三月十八日
