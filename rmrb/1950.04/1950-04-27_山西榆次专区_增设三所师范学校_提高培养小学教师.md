　　Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province
    Three Normal Schools Added
    To Improve Elementary School Teacher Training
    [Our News] In order to improve and cultivate elementary school teachers, Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, opened three joint normal schools in March, with a total of twelve classes. Together with the Xi(yang) He(shun) Zuo(quan) Yu(she) Joint Normal School established last year, the entire prefecture now has a total of four joint normal schools, with seventeen classes and more than 850 students. The joint normal schools are currently one-year programs, but will gradually be changed to two-year programs. The students are drawn from unqualified elementary school teachers transferred from various counties, existing simple normal school students from various counties, and newly recruited teachers. Attention was paid to the students' learning motivations during enrollment, and those unwilling to engage in education work were not accepted. Graduates must serve as teachers for at least three years. The expenses of each school are resolved from the local education funds of the prefecture, under the principle of careful calculation and frugality everywhere.

　　山西榆次专区
    增设三所师范学校
    提高培养小学教师
    【本报讯】山西省榆次专区，为提高与培养小学教员，于三月份开办了联立师范学校三所，共设十二个班，连去年成立的昔（阳）和（顺）左（权）榆（社）联立师范学校，全专区已共有联师四座，共十七个班，学员八百五十余人。联师目前暂为一年制，将逐步改为二年制。学生的来源是各县调来的不称职小学教员、原有各县简易师范学生及招收的新教员。招生时注意了学生的学习动机，不愿任教育工作的不收。学生毕业后至少须担任教员三年。各校的经费，在精打细算，处处节约的原则下，由本专区的地方教育经费中解决。
