　　We will definitely overcome the famine!
    Statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government:
    A total of 1.2 billion catties of grain allocated to aid disaster-stricken people in North and East China.
    [Reported by our newspaper] The Central People's Government has led and assisted disaster victims in various regions with great efforts to overcome the famine, and has allocated a large amount of food for this purpose. According to statistics from the Research Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, the public grain allocated from the treasury for disaster relief in the five provinces of North China and parts of East China alone amounted to 1,210.9 million catties. Some of this disaster relief grain was provided to disaster victims without compensation, namely, emergency relief grain and relief grain. Emergency relief grain amounted to 14 million catties, used in the severely affected areas of Hebei Province and Pingyuan Province. Relief grain amounted to 151.1 million catties, used in the five provinces of North China and Shandong, Subei, and Wanbei in East China. Another portion of the disaster relief grain was used in conjunction with production and construction projects, namely, grain used for work relief and grain to support various sideline production activities. For example, Pingyuan Province and Shandong Province used 81.24 million catties of grain for work relief in repairing the Yellow River. Shandong, Subei, and Anhui used a total of 484.41 million catties of grain for work relief, mainly for water conservancy projects. Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Subei, and Wanbei used a total of over 310 million catties of grain to purchase sideline products and native products. In addition, the Ministry of Trade provided loans of 147.5 million catties of grain to be repaid after the wheat harvest, used in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces. Furthermore, the local grain mobilized by local governments for disaster relief and the grain collected by people from all walks of life for disaster victims are not included in these statistics. In the context of the nation's financial difficulties, the ability to allocate such a huge amount of grain to support the disaster-stricken people in production and to overcome the famine demonstrates that we have the means to overcome the difficulties that lie before us. These grains are basically sufficient to help disaster victims in various regions overcome the famine. The main issue now lies in how to rapidly, reasonably, and effectively use these grains, and to deeply, meticulously, and specifically mobilize and organize disaster victims for production. There are still phenomena of delayed allocation of disaster relief grain in some areas, and there are shortcomings in the planning and organization of grain transportation. If these shortcomings are not quickly overcome, the disaster situation will not improve even with the availability of disaster relief grain. However, as long as all regions pay attention, these shortcomings can be completely overcome. By properly utilizing the existing disaster relief grain, we will surely be able to overcome the famine.

　　我们定能战胜灾荒！
    中央人民政府内务部统计
    援助华北华东灾胞拨粮共达十二亿斤
    【本报讯】中央人民政府曾以极大力量领导并援助各地灾民渡过灾荒，为此曾拨出了大批食粮。据中央人民政府内务部研究室统计，仅华北五省及华东部分地区，从财政上拨用于救灾的公粮就有十二亿一千零九十万斤。这些救灾粮，一部分是无代价付给灾民的，即急赈粮和救济粮。急赈粮一千四百万斤，用于河北省和平原省的重灾区。救济粮一亿五千一百一十万斤，用于华北五省及华东的山东、苏北、皖北。另一部分救灾粮是结合着生产建设事业用的，即以工代赈粮和支持各种副业生产的粮食。如平原省、山东省以工代赈修治黄河，用粮八千一百二十四万斤。山东、苏北、安徽以工代赈粮共四亿八千四百四十一万斤，主要用于水利工程。河北、平原、山东、苏北、皖北，收购副业产品及土产共用粮三亿一千多万斤。此外，还有贸易部贷粮麦秋后收回一亿四千七百五十万斤，用于河北、平原两省。此外各地政府为救灾动用的地方粮及由各界人民为灾胞募集的粮食，尚未计算在内。在国家财政困难的情况下，能拨出如此巨大数目的粮食支持灾区人民生产渡荒，说明我们是有办法克服横亘在我们面前的困难的。这些粮食已基本上够援助各地灾民渡过灾荒，今后的主要问题就在于如何迅速地合理地有效地运用这些粮食，深入地细致地具体地动员与组织灾民生产。各地救灾粮还有拨付迟缓的现象，运粮中也还有计划性组织性不够的缺点。这些缺点，如果不迅速克服，虽然有了救灾粮，灾情仍不会好转的。但是，只要各地加以注意，这都是完全可以克服的。好好运用已有的救灾粮，我们必然能够战胜灾荒。
