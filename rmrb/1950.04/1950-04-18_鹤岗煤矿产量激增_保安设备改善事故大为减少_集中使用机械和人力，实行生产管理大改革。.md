Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. A major reform in the state-owned Hegang Coal Mine of Northeast China, focusing on the concentrated use of machinery and manpower in production management, has, after three months of practice, increased coal production by 60%, while reducing the number of mining workers by 17.7%.

　　Last year, during the movement to create new production records, the mine discovered unreasonable phenomena due to the dispersion of workfaces (places for coal mining and tunneling in the pit): dispersed use of machinery, preventing full utilization of efficiency; long transportation lines and high material consumption; complex transportation systems, prone to accidents; complex ventilation systems, often suffering from insufficient airflow; and dispersed work, making it difficult for production management and safety personnel to provide adequate care. To address these issues, the mine decided to reform the old production methods and, in November of last year, concentrated 352 workfaces into 144, and adjusted mechanical equipment and assigned administrative management and safety personnel according to the needs of specialized division of labor.

　　Three months of experience have proven that since the concentration of production, the above shortcomings have been corrected one by one. Regarding the full utilization of mechanical efficiency, before the concentration, an average of three workfaces shared one electric drill; after the concentration, each workface had an average of one electric drill, thus eliminating the waste of time caused by waiting for tools. In addition, with the improvement of tool usage techniques, the coal mining rate of each underground worker in the mine increased from 1.97 tons per shift before the concentration to 2.83 tons in early March. The consumption of materials has also been greatly reduced due to the shortening of transportation lines. For example, after reducing the original six horizontal roadways (coal transport routes in the pit) in the No. 2 inclined shaft of the Nanshan No. 11 pit to two, the required steel rails, wires, and air ducts were reduced from 2,400 meters to 1,200 meters. According to the mine's January statistics, the consumption of pit wood per ton of coal was 12.8% lower than originally planned, timber was 18.6% lower, electricity was 15% lower, steel and electrical appliances were 73% lower, and the cost of coal in January was 9.3% lower than originally planned. Another important factor in reducing costs and increasing efficiency was the reduction of unnecessary tunneling workfaces and the widening of the working faces of the coal mining workfaces, which changed the ratio of coal production from coal mining workfaces and tunneling workfaces from 4.5 to 5.5 in the past to 8 to 2 now. In terms of safety, the simplification of the ventilation system has ensured sufficient airflow in each inclined shaft. Before the concentration, except for the four mechanically ventilated inclined shafts where each person could get 3 cubic meters of airflow per minute, the remaining shafts generally only got 1 cubic meter. After the concentration, each shaft exceeded 3 cubic meters, with 11 shaft entrances reaching 30 cubic meters. In the past, the Dongshan No. 6 pit could not use blasting methods for coal mining due to high gas levels and relied entirely on manual excavation; now, due to the concentrated use of ventilation machinery, the gas level has been reduced to below 0.5%, and blasting methods have begun to be used for coal mining. Throughout the mine, the ample supply of airflow and the concentrated use of safety personnel have greatly reduced accidents. Taking the Dongshan mining area as an example, based on a comparison of the four months before and after the concentration, accidents have been reduced by more than half, and casualties have been reduced by 61%. Due to the success of the above reforms, the Hegang Coal Mine plans to suspend coal production from eight more inclined shafts in the second quarter of this year to use existing machinery and manpower more intensively, and strive to achieve mechanized coal mining in 80% of the mine's shaft entrances within the year.

　　鹤岗煤矿产量激增
    保安设备改善事故大为减少
    集中使用机械和人力，实行生产管理大改革。
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北国营鹤岗煤矿集中使用机械和人力的生产管理方面的大改革，经过三个月来的实践使煤产量增加百分之六十，而采掘工人反减少了百分之十七点七。
    去年该矿在创造生产新纪录运动中，发现由于掌子（坑内采煤和掘进的地方）分散，造成机械分散使用，不能充分发挥效能；搬运线长，材料消耗多；搬运系统复杂，易发生事故；通风系统复杂，风量常患不足；工作分散，生产管理、保安工作人员照顾不周等不合理现象。为此该矿决定改革旧的生产方法，于去年十一月将三百五十二个掌子集中为一百四十四个，并按专业分工的需要调整了机械设备和配备了行政管理、保安工作人员。
    三个月的经验证明，自从集中生产后，上述缺点都一一得到纠正。在充分发挥机械效能上，集中前平均三个掌子合用一台电钻，集中后平均每个掌子有了一台电钻，从而消灭了因等待工具而产生的时间浪费。加上使用工具技术的提高，该矿每个井下工人的采煤率便自集中前的每工一·九七吨增至三月上旬的二·八三吨。材料的消耗，由于运输线的缩短，也大为减少。如南山十一坑二斜井原有的六条平巷（坑内运煤道）减为二条后，所需钢轨、电线、风管即由二千四百米减为一千二百米。据该矿一月份的统计，每吨煤坑木的消耗比原计划减少百分之一二·八，原木减少百分之一八·六，电力减少百分之一五，钢材、电器减少百分之七三，煤的成本一月份比原计划降低百分之九·三。降低成本提高效率的另一个重要因素便是由于减少了不必要的掘进掌子，加宽了采煤掌子的工作面，使得采煤掌子产煤量和掘进掌子产煤量的比例从过去四·五比五·五，改变为现在的八比二。保安方面，由于简化了通风系统，各斜坑的风量便获得充分保证。集中前除四个机械通风的斜坑每人每分钟能得三立方米风量外，其余各坑一般都只能得一立方米。集中后各坑均超过了三立方米，其中有十一个坑口达到三十立方米。过去东山六坑因瓦斯多而不能用爆破法采煤，全用手刨；现在由于通风机械的集中使用，瓦斯减至百分之○·五以下，已开始用爆破法采煤了。全矿由于风量供应充足，保安工作人员的集中使用，事故已大为减少。以东山矿场为例，根据集中前后四个月的比较，事故减少一半以上，伤亡减少百分之六十一。由于上述改革获得成功，鹤岗煤矿准备在今年第二季生产中再停止八个斜坑出煤，以更加集中地使用现有机械和人力，并争取在年内全矿百分之八十的坑口做到机械化采煤。
