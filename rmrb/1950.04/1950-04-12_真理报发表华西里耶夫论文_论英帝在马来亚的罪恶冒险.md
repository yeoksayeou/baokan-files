　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th: *Pravda* published an article by Vasilyev on the 10th, commenting on the sinister adventure of British imperialism in Malaya.

　　The author writes: The British reactionaries are doing everything possible to deceive their people and prevent them from knowing the extent of the national liberation struggle of the Malayan people. British official representatives say that they are fighting with "very few terrorists." But who are the 120,000 British troops equipped with artillery and tanks fighting against? Who did the British Secretary of State for War, Strachey, send dozens of armored vehicles and four-engine bombers to deal with?

　　The British imperialists want to conceal, but cannot conceal, that their target of combat is not the small group of "rebels" they claim, but an entire nation determined to fight for freedom.

　　The British Labor rulers deceive the British people and prevent them from knowing for whose benefit the sinister adventure in Malaya is being carried out. Who exactly wants to spend 150 million pounds to slaughter and injure hundreds of thousands of people, and expel more than 20,000 Malayan patriots from Malaya or imprison them in concentration camps? They don't say a word about this question. But the murderers will eventually be exposed. The war in Malaya is a war waged for the benefit of British monopoly capitalists - the rubber and tin tycoons.

　　The Labor colonialists' military efforts, as well as their political means of deceiving the Malayan people with promises of some kind of "autonomy," inciting ethnic discord, and weakening the democratic forces of Malaya, have not succeeded. In this situation, Britain is seeking assistance from its accomplice—its rival in colonial plunder—the United States.

　　American imperialists have also shown great interest in Malaya. Malaya has aroused the greed of American imperialism because it is located in an extremely important strategic position and is the object of American capital investment. American imperialists hope to drag Malaya into the Pacific aggressive bloc they are assembling. The United States intends to use this bloc to confront the national liberation movement of the Asian people. The colonial adventure in Malaya is an integral part of the Anglo-American warmongers' aggression plan. For this reason, millions of peace advocates around the world are constantly demanding an end to the war against the Malayan people.

　　The British Labor rulers are now frantically trying to obtain at least some false "victories" in the war against the Malayan people. They are sending new commanders-in-chief and jet planes, new ministers and armored vehicles to Malaya. However, the British imperialists' attempt to make the Malayan people abandon their efforts to fight for national liberation is doomed to ultimate failure, just as the French, Dutch, and American accomplices want to strangle the liberation movements of other Asian people. A new era has begun in the lives of the Asian people, an era of liberation from colonial slavery.

### 真理报发表华西里耶夫论文  论英帝在马来亚的罪恶冒险

　　真理报发表华西里耶夫论文
    论英帝在马来亚的罪恶冒险
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十日刊载华西里耶夫的论文，评论英国帝国主义在马来亚的罪恶冒险。
    作者写道：英国反动派千方百计地蒙蔽国内的人民，不让他们知道马来亚人民的民族解放斗争发展到了怎样的规模。英国的官方代表说，他们是在与“很少几个恐怖分子”作战。但是，十二万配备着大炮和坦克的英国陆军，一直是在和谁作战呢？英国陆军大臣斯特拉彻派遣几十部装甲车和四引擎的轰炸机又是去对付谁呢？
    英国帝国主义者想要掩盖但是又掩盖不了他们作战的对象并不是他们所说的一小撮“叛匪”，而是坚决要争取自由的整个国家。
    不列颠的工党统治者们蒙蔽英国人民，不让他们知道在马来亚的罪恶冒险是为了谁的利益而进行的。究竟是谁要以一亿五千万英镑的开支来屠杀和伤害成千上万的人民，把两万多马来亚爱国者逐出马来亚或者囚禁和关在集中营里呢？对于这个问题，他们一句话也不说。但是，杀人犯终究会暴露出来的。马来亚的战争，是为着英国垄断资本家——橡胶与锡大王——的利益而进行的战争。
    工党殖民者的军事努力以及他们用某种“自治”的诺言来欺骗马来亚人民，煽动民族不和与削弱马来亚的民主力量等政治手段，都没有成功。在这种情形下，英国向它的同伙——殖民地掠夺中的敌手——美国求援。
    美国帝国主义者对马来亚也表现得很感兴趣。马来亚引起了美帝的贪欲，因为它处在极端重要的战略地位上，并且是美国资本投资的对象。美国帝国主义者希望将马来亚拉入他们正在纠合的太平洋侵略集团中，美国打算用这个集团来对抗亚洲人民的民族解放运动。在马来亚的殖民冒险，是英美战争贩子侵略计划的组成部分。正因为如此，全世界千百万的和平拥护者，不断地要求停止对马来亚人民的战争。
    英国的工党统治者现在正狂热地企图在对马来亚人民的战争中至少获得一些假的“胜利”。他们将新的总司令和喷气式飞机，新的部长和装甲车送到马来亚，但是，英国帝国主义者想要使马来亚人民放弃争取民族解放斗争的努力，是注定了终久要失败的，正如法国、荷兰与美国的同谋犯想要扼杀其他亚洲人民的解放运动一样。亚洲人民生活的新纪元已经开始了，这是从殖民地奴役下解放出来的新纪元。
