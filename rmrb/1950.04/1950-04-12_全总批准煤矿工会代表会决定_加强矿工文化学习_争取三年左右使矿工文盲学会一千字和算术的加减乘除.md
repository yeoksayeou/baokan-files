Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Standing Committee has approved the "Decision on Strengthening the Amateur Cultural and Technical Education of Mine Workers" passed by the National Coal Miners' Union Representative Conference on February 1st. The decision pointed out: The low level of cultural knowledge of miners (according to incomplete statistics, illiteracy accounts for more than 70% of all miners) has become a serious obstacle to improving production technology and improving safety and hygiene. Therefore, except for a few new mining areas where general political enlightenment education has not yet been carried out, the remaining mines should conduct amateur cultural and technical education in the future. The decision stipulates that the basic requirements for amateur education are: strive to enable illiterate miners in major mining areas to learn one thousand characters and addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in arithmetic in about three years. In terms of technical education, workers with practical technical experience should learn the basic principles of technology, and other general workers should understand basic technical knowledge and safety rules. The decision also contains specific provisions on issues such as leadership, organizational forms, study time, systems, and teachers for amateur learning.

　　全总批准煤矿工会代表会决定
    加强矿工文化学习
    争取三年左右使矿工文盲学会一千字和算术的加减乘除
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国总工会常务委员会已批准二月一日全国煤矿工会代表会议所通过的“关于加强矿山工人业余文化技术教育工作的决定”。该决定指出：矿工文化知识水平低下（据不完全统计，文盲占全部矿工的百分之七十以上）已成为当前提高生产技术改善安全卫生工作的严重障碍。因此除少数新区矿山尚未进行一般政治启蒙教育工作者外，其余矿山今后应进行业余的文化技术教育。决定规定业余教育的基本要求是：争取三年左右使各大矿区矿工文盲学会一千字和算术中的加减乘除。在技术教育上则要求使有实际技术经验的工人学会初步的技术原理，其余一般工人懂得基本技术知识与安全规则。关于业余学习的领导、组织形式、学习时间、制度、教员等问题，决定中亦有具体规定。
