　　Introduction to Poland—People's Democratic Countries of Eastern Europe
    邱静

    Poland began to form as early as a thousand years ago. She had a prosperous period in ancient world history. At the end of the 18th century, Germany, Austria, and Tsarist Russia divided Poland three times. It was not until the success of Russia's great October Socialist Revolution that the conditions for Poland's independence were created. The current Polish state is the country that was re-established after World War I, having freed itself from the rule of Germany, Austria, and Tsarist Russia. As soon as the October Revolution was victorious, the Soviet Union immediately announced the abolition of all treaties related to Tsarist Russia's partition of Poland, and recognized the Polish people's right to independence.

    After being liberated from German, Austrian and Russian rule, Poland's working class began to fight for the establishment of a democratic Polish state. However, due to the weakness of democratic forces at that time, the Polish regime was usurped by the Polish landlords and bourgeoisie, supported by the Entente powers. The reactionary ruler Piłsudski, at the instigation of reactionaries in various countries, invaded the Soviet Union and implemented autocratic dictatorship domestically, which aroused opposition from the people. After 1933, Poland more actively pro-German and anti-Soviet, and wanted to take advantage of Hitler's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia to expand its territory. As a result, she herself could not escape Hitler's clutches. In early September 1939, less than six days after the outbreak of World War II, the entire Poland fell under the iron heel of fascism. The Warsaw government abandoned the people at home and fled to London, organizing a government-in-exile. At that time, in Poland's vast rural areas, a feudal system of tenant slavery existed, hindering the development of the rural economy. Industry, on the other hand, was completely controlled by foreign capital, bearing huge imperialist debts, thus hindering the development of Poland's own industry.

    The policies of Poland's reactionary groups plunged Poland into deep disaster. The Polish people waged an arduous struggle for freedom and independence. In 1942, under the Nazi German occupation, some members of the former Polish Communist Party and other progressive elements in the country re-formed the Polish Workers' Party, the party of the Polish working class, and since then the people, under its leadership, carried out a heroic national war against the fascist occupiers. However, on the other hand, the reactionary Piłsudski followers and various speculators, with the support of the Polish government-in-exile, organized the so-called "Armed Struggle Alliance" and the "Association for the Defense of Poland." Not only did they not fight the Nazi German army, but they also colluded with the German army to fight against the people's guerrillas. This deeply educated the Polish people, making them understand how the government-in-exile was betraying the interests of the people.

    At the end of 1943, the democratic parties, led by the Polish Workers' Party, secretly organized the People's Representative Council in Warsaw as the highest institution leading the national resistance, uniting domestic democratic forces, establishing the Polish People's Army, and establishing friendly diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The following year, after the Soviet army launched the Polish liberation war, the Committee of National Liberation, of a provisional government nature, was established, promulgating a democratic program of resistance, and carrying out many democratic reforms, including land reform. As a result, the Committee of National Liberation won the sincere support of the broad masses of people. The London government-in-exile was extremely disturbed by this, and negotiated with the Committee of National Liberation, which eventually broke down because the government-in-exile was not sincere about genuine democratic reform in the country. In early 1945, the Committee of National Liberation was officially renamed the Provisional Government, and the Soviet Union was the first to recognize it. In March of the same year, the heroic Red Army liberated the entire territory of Poland. According to the resolutions of the Crimean and Potsdam conferences, on June 28, a unified national democratic coalition government of Poland was established on the basis of the Provisional Government, including the London government-in-exile.

    The new People's Democratic Poland was created under extremely acute class struggle. On the one hand, the four parties participating in the Committee of National Liberation—the Workers' Party, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the Peasants' Party—resolutely demanded the establishment of a people's Poland without big capitalists and big landlords. On the other hand, the secret agents of Anglo-American imperialism, the former reactionary Prime Minister of the government-in-exile Mikołajczyk's Polish Peasants' Party, and reactionary terrorist underground elements colluded to launch extensive sabotage activities, attempting to throw Poland back into the dark rule of the reactionary Piłsudski era. Although the reactionaries fiercely resisted, many fundamental political and economic democratic reforms were still implemented. In 1944, the Committee of National Liberation passed the Land Reform Law, stipulating the confiscation without compensation of the landlords' land of more than 50 hectares, and the distribution of land to landless or land-poor peasants. The result of the land reform fundamentally changed the relationship of class forces in the Polish countryside, eliminated the largest stronghold of the Polish reactionaries—the economic foundation of the landlords—and greatly enhanced the political activism of the poor and middle peasants. On the other hand, in January 1946, the nationalization of banks, transportation enterprises, and large and medium-sized industries was implemented. Enterprises employing more than 50 workers per shift were nationalized, and enterprises of German capitalists and traitors of the Polish people were confiscated without compensation. This weakened the economic power of the bourgeoisie and destroyed the imperialist rule of foreign capital in Poland, thereby laying the foundation for the state-owned economy of the people's democratic state, and thereby creating the prerequisites for the transition to socialist development. Both of these basic reforms received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people.

    In January 1947, national parliamentary elections were held. The Democratic Front, led by the Workers' Party and including the Polish Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the Peasants' Party, won a great victory by obtaining more than 80 percent of the vote. Mikołajczyk's reactionary Polish Peasants' Party suffered a crushing defeat in the election. In this election, the Polish people fully demonstrated their will and determination to yearn for genuine democracy. After the general election, the new parliament was established, and the leader of the Workers' Party, Bierut, was elected as the president of the republic, and the new republican government was proclaimed. The provisional democratic constitution was also promulgated, and from then on, Poland embarked on the road of people's democratic construction.

    The new Polish Republic has a territory of 312,000 square kilometers. The population is 24 million, of which 7.5 million are urban residents and 16.5 million are rural residents. The country is divided into 14 provinces, 2 directly administered cities, 317 districts, and more than 3,000 villages.

    Hitler's war plunder caused unprecedented destruction and disaster to the Polish people. Six million people, a quarter of the country's population, were killed by Nazi executioners. During the war, 85 percent of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. All industrial equipment was either moved or destroyed. Warsaw became a desolate graveyard. Fifty-five percent of the country's livestock were slaughtered by the German bandits. Forests and timber were cut down. Eighty-four percent of the railways and 60 percent of the schools were destroyed. However, thanks to the democratic government's implementation of effective measures to transform the social economy, the people's patriotic spirit and labor enthusiasm, and their inexhaustible creativity, and with the friendly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the close cooperation between the people's democratic countries, Poland was able to overcome numerous difficulties in the short years after the war, recover from the enormous wounds of the war, and further lay the foundation for socialist construction.

    Another objective condition for rapid economic recovery was the post-war change in Poland's territory, which was conducive to Poland's economic recovery. After the war, Poland recovered Silesia, a highly industrialized region, and gained convenient access to the sea, thus making it possible to develop the shipping industry. According to the Potsdam Agreement, Poland also recovered 39,000 square miles of land in the west and north along the Nyssa and Oder rivers, which is rich in natural resources and also a highly industrialized area, thus giving Poland the basis for transforming from a pre-war agricultural country into an agricultural and industrial country with equal emphasis.

    The result of the three-year plan for economic recovery, which was completed ahead of schedule from 1947 to October 1949, laid the economic foundation of People's Democratic Poland. When the three-year plan was completed in October 1949, the production of coal, coke, and electricity was twice that of pre-war levels, steel production exceeded pre-war levels by 35 percent, and the manufacture of agricultural machinery and tools had more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. The total industrial output had exceeded pre-war levels by 75 percent. Industry accounted for 64 percent of the national economy, and the total output of the socialist sector accounted for 94 percent of the total industry. In terms of agriculture, the 1948 harvest reached sufficient self-sufficiency. In 1949, 1 percent of the country's land was organized into production cooperatives. National income increased to 180 million zlotys (Polish currency), exceeding pre-war levels by 17 percent. The living standards of the working people have generally exceeded pre-war levels.

    In the first few years after the war, the main target of foreign trade was the Soviet Union. The main export was coal. Currently, Poland has trade relations with 35 countries, of which 21 countries export coal. Other exports include sugar, textiles, glass, chemicals, eggs, etc.

    On May 30, 1949, the Council of Ministers also approved the six-year plan for economic development from 1950 to 1955. This plan is based on the completed three-year plan. According to this plan, the production of state-owned industry will increase by 114 percent, light industrial production will increase by 100 percent, agricultural machine production will increase by 200 percent, and agricultural production will increase by 45 percent. The six-year plan will also produce goods that Poland had not produced before, such as the metal industry sector will produce machines for various industrial sectors, electric motors, electric locomotives, new agricultural machines, and create a large-scale automobile industry and develop the tractor industry. When the six-year plan is completed, the living standards of the working people will be twice as high as before the war.

    In the process of fighting against reactionary forces, the Polish people have also made great achievements in cultural life. Polish culture has a long and glorious tradition. The University of Kraków, established in 1364, is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Copernicus, Chopin, and Madame Curie are outstanding talents of culture and science that Poland is proud of. During Hitler's bloody rule, Polish culture was also severely destroyed. In terms of the destruction of cultural and scientific talents alone, there are the following statistics: 700 professors from universities and middle schools, 5,000 teachers from junior high schools and elementary schools, 122 journalists, 235 painters and sculptors, 104 actors, 60 musicians and 56 writers were killed by Nazi fascists. Due to the irrepressible power of the Polish people, Polish culture is now flourishing again. Shortly after the war, Poland's 39 universities and specialized schools already had 100,000 students, twice the pre-war number. Theaters, symphony orchestras, and museums have greatly increased. The people actively show a continued increase in love and need for education and culture. Two thousand amateur theater troupes and one thousand three hundred workers' choirs have now been organized in factory clubs, and book sales have more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. A large-scale literacy campaign is underway to eliminate the painful legacy left by the capitalist system—illiteracy. When the six-year plan is completed, the number of students in various schools will also increase; an increase of 21 percent for children in seven-year education, an increase of 85 percent for adult primary school students, an increase of 33 percent for vocational school students, and an increase of 85 percent for technical school students. The culture of the new Polish Republic is integrated with the working people.

    In addition, another thing that must be mentioned is that after overcoming the right-leaning ideas and nationalistic biases that hindered Poland's path to socialism, the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party merged in December 1948 on the basis of Marxism-Leninism to establish the Polish United Workers' Party, which made the working class more united to fight against capitalist elements in urban and rural areas to further complete the construction of the new Poland.

    The reason why People's Democratic Poland has achieved so many brilliant achievements is that it is due to the leadership of the working class in the people's political life, and the leading role of its vanguard, the Polish United Workers' Party, in the various democratic parties, which organized a strong united front of the working people, and the close reliance on the Soviet Union, which consolidated the foundation of the Polish people's democracy. The Polish people love peace and demand progress. Under the leadership of President Bierut, Chairman of the United Workers' Party, they will continue to work hard to advance Poland towards socialism.

　　波兰—东欧人民民主国家介绍
    邱静
    远在一千年前，波兰已开始形成了。她在古代世界史上曾有过一个昌盛时期。十八世纪末，德国，奥地利和帝俄三次瓜分了波兰。直至俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命成功，才创造了波兰独立的条件。现在的波兰国家就是第一次世界大战后，摆脱了德、奥和沙俄的统治而重新建立起来的国家。十月革命一胜利，苏联就立即宣布废除有关沙俄对于瓜分波兰的一切条约，并承认波兰人民的独立权利。
    从德奥俄统治下解放出来后，波兰的工人阶级就开始为建立民主的波兰国家而斗争。但是由于那时民主力量的幼弱，波兰政权被协约国列强扶持下的波兰地主资产阶级所僭取。反动统治者毕苏斯基在各国反动派的唆使下进兵侵略苏联，在国内则实行专制独裁，因此引起了人民的反对。一九三三年后波兰更积极亲德反苏，并想乘希特勒吞并奥地利和捷克时来开拓疆土。结果她自己也逃不出希特勒的摩掌，一九三九年九月初第二次世界大战爆发后不到六天，整个波兰就在法西斯的铁蹄下沦亡了。华沙政府则抛弃了国内人民，逃往伦敦，组织流亡政府。那时波兰广大的农村，存在着封建的佃租奴役制度，阻碍了农村经济的发展。工业方面却完全受外国资本所控制，负着巨额帝国主义的外债，因此阻碍了波兰本国工业的发展。
    波兰反动集团的政策使波兰陷入深重的灾难。波兰人民进行了为自由和独立的艰苦斗争。一九四二年，在纳粹德国占领下，前波兰共产党的一部分党员及国内其他进步分子重又组成波兰工人阶级的政党波兰工人党，此后人民就在它领导下与法西斯占领者进行英勇的民族战争。可是另一方面反动的毕苏斯基党徒和各种投机分子在波兰流亡政府的支持下组织所谓“武装斗争同盟”和“保卫波兰协会”，他不但不与纳粹德军作战，反而勾结德军来与人民游击队为敌，这深深地教育了波兰人民，使他们明白流亡政府是怎样在出卖人民的利益。
    一九四三年底，以波兰工人党为首的各民主党派在华沙秘密组织人民代表会议，作为领导全国抗战的最高机构，团结国内民主力量，建立波兰人民军，并与苏联建立了友好的外交关系。次年，在苏军展开了波兰解放战后，又成立了临时政府性质的民族解放委员会，颁布抗战的民主纲领，进行了许多民主改革，其中包括土地改革，因此民族解放委员会获得了广大人民的衷心拥护。伦敦的流亡政府对此则极感不安，于是就与民族解放委员会进行谈判，终因流亡政府不诚意于国内的真正民主改革而告破裂。一九四五年初，民族解放委员会正式改称为临时政府，苏联首先予以承认。同年三月，英勇的红军解放了波兰全境。根据克里米亚和波茨坦两次会议的决议，六月二十八日就成立了以临时政府为基础，包括伦敦流亡政府的波兰全国统一的民主联合政府。
    新人民民主主义的波兰是在极端尖锐的阶级斗争情况下缔造的。一方面是参加民族解放委员会的四个政党：工人党，社会党，民主党和农民党坚决要求建立一个没有大资本家和大地主的人民波兰，一方面是英美帝国主义的秘密特务前反动流亡政府总理米柯拉兹科的波兰农民党和反动的恐怖主义的地下分子勾结起来，展开了广泛的破坏活动，企图把波兰重又投入反动的毕苏斯基黑暗统治时代去。虽然反动派激烈反抗，许多根本的政治经济民主改革仍见诸实行。一九四四年民族解放委员会通过土地改革法，规定无代价没收五十公顷以上的地主土地，分地给无地或少地的农民。土地改革的结果根本改变了波兰农村阶级力量的相互关系，消灭了波兰反动派最大的一个堡垒——地主的经济基础，并大大提高了贫农和中农的政治积极性。另一方面一九四六年一月，实行银行，交通运输企业和大中工业的国有化，凡是一次轮班雇用五十工人以上的企业实行国有化，并无代价没收德国资本家，波兰人民的叛徒的企业。这样就削弱了资产阶级的经济力量和毁灭了外国资本帝国主义在波兰的统治势力，从而奠定了人民民主国家国营经济的基础，并由此而产生了过渡到社会主义发展的先决条件。这两种基本改革都得到了广大人民的热烈支持。
    一九四七年一月全国进行议会选举，在工人党领导下包括波兰社会党，民主党和农民党的民主阵线以取得百分之八十以上的选票而获大胜。米柯拉兹科反动的波兰农民党在选举中遭到惨败。波兰人民在这次选举中充分表现了他们的意志和向往真正民主的决心。大选后新议会成立，工人党的领袖贝鲁特被选为共和国的总统，新的共和国政府宣告成立。临时的民主宪法也随即颁布，从此波兰就走上了人民民主主义建设的大道。
    新的波兰共和国，领土面积三十一万二千平方公里。人口二千四百万，其中七百五十万是城市居民，一千六百五十万是乡村居民。全国分十四个行省，两个直属市，三百十七个区，三千余个村子。
    希特勒的战争掠夺，使波兰人民遭受空前的破坏与灾难。占全国人口四分之一的六百万人被纳粹刽子手所杀害。战时华沙的建筑物百分之八十五遭到破坏。一切工业设备都被搬走或破坏。华沙变成了一个荒凉的墓地。全国百分之五十五的牲畜被德寇宰杀。森林木材被砍去。百分之八十四的铁路、百分之六十的学校被毁。可是由于民主政府实行了改造社会经济的有效措施，人民的爱国精神和劳动热忱和他们源源的创造力，并在苏联友好的大公无私的援助和各人民民主国家间的密切合作之下，使波兰能在战后短短的几年中克服了重重的困难，恢复了战争中的巨大创伤，并进一步地去奠定社会主义建设的基础。
    迅速恢复经济的另一客观条件是战后波兰的疆土起了对波兰有利于恢复经济的变化。战后波兰收回了西里西亚，那是一个高度工业化的地区，并使波兰获得便利的出海口，因而有发展航海工业的可能性。依照波茨坦协定，波兰又收回西部和北部沿尼斯河和奥得河三万九千方英里的土地，那里富有天然资源而且也是高度工业化的地区，这样给了波兰一个从战前农业国转变为农业工业并重的国家的基础。
    一九四七年到一九四九年十月先期完成的恢复经济的三年计划的结果，奠定了波兰人民民主主义的经济基础。一九四九年十月三年计划完成时，煤、焦炭与电力的生产比战前多两倍，钢的生产超过战前百分之三十五，农业机械和工具的制造已超过战前两倍，工业总生产量已超过战前水平的百分之七十五。工业在国民经济中所占的比重为百分之六十四，而属于社会主义部分的工业总产量占全部工业的百分之九十四。农业方面一九四八年的收成已达到足够自给。一九四九年，全国有百分之一的土地已组织在生产合作社中。国民收入增加到一亿八千万兹罗提（波币），超过战前百分之十七。劳动人民的生活水准都普遍地超过战前的水平。
    在战后的最初几年，对外贸易主要对象是苏联。主要的出口是煤。目前波兰与三十五个国家有贸易关系，其中向二十一个国家输出煤。其他出口品有糖、纺织品、玻璃、化学品、蛋品等。
    一九四九年五月三十日，部长会议又通过了自一九五○年到一九五五年发展经济的六年计划。这个计划是以完成了的三年计划为基础。根据这一计划，国营工业的生产将增加百分之一百十四，轻工业生产增加百分之一百，农业机器生产增加百分之二百，农业生产增加百分之四十五。六年计划还要生产波兰以前没有生产过的货品，如金属工业部门将生产各工业部门用的机器，电力发动机，电气火车头，新式的农业机器，并创建大规模的汽车工业和发展拖拉机工业。六年计划完成时。劳动人民的生活水准就将比战前提高两倍。
    波兰人民在与反动势力斗争的过程中，同样地在文化生活方面也得到很大的成就。波兰的文化是有她悠久的光辉传统的。一三六四年建立的格拉科大学是欧洲最老的大学之一。哥白尼、萧邦和居里夫人就是波兰所引以为荣的文化与科学的杰出人才。在希特勒的血腥统治时期内，波兰文化也一样受到严重的摧残。单以文化科学人材的被摧残而言，即有如下的统计：七百个大中学教授，五千个初中与小学教师，一百二十二个新闻记者，二百三十五个画家与雕刻家，一百另四个演员，六十个音乐家与五十六个作家被纳粹法西斯杀害。由于波兰人民的不可压制的力量，波兰的文化现在又重新繁荣起来了。战后不久，波兰的三十九个大学与专门学校已有十万个学生，即两倍于战前的人数。剧院，交响乐队和博物院都大大增加。人民积极表现出对教育和文化的继续增高的热爱和需要，现在在工厂俱乐部中已经组织了二千个业余剧团和一千三百个工人歌咏队，书籍的销路超过战前两倍。对于资本主义制度所留下来的痛苦的遗产——文盲，正在进行大规模的识字运动予以消灭。六年计划完成时，各种学校的学生人数还将增加；计七年教育的儿童增加百分之二十一。成人初级学校学生增加百分之八十五。职业学校学生增加百分之三十三，技术学校学生增加百分之八十五。新的波兰共和国的文化是与劳动人民融合在一起的。
    此外，另一件事也必须要提的，就是波兰工人党和波兰社会党于克服了阻碍波兰走向社会主义道路上的右倾思想与民族主义偏向后，一九四八年十二月在马列主义的基础上，两党合并而建立了波兰统一工人党，使工人阶级更加团结起来，与城乡资本主义分子作斗争，来进一步完成新波兰的建设。
    人民民主主义的波兰所以能获得这许多辉煌的成就，那就是由于工人阶级在人民的政治生活中的领导，和它的先锋队波兰统一工人党在各民主党派中的领导作用，组织了强大的劳动人民的联合阵线，和苏联紧紧地靠在一起而巩固了波兰人民民主的基础。波兰人民热爱和平并要求进步，在统一工人党主席贝鲁特总统的领导下，将继续努力使波兰向着社会主义迈进。
