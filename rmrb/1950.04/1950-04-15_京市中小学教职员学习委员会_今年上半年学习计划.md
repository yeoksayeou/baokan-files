Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Learning Committee
This Year's First Half Learning Plan

[Reported by this newspaper] The full text of the "1950 First Half Year Learning Plan" formulated by the Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Learning Committee is as follows:

A. Guiding Principles

The fundamental key to the current transformation of old education and the improvement of teacher quality lies in further enhancing the political and ideological level of teachers and staff, and on that basis, improving their professional competence. In the year since liberation, Beijing's teachers and staff have made certain achievements in political study, but generally, it still lags behind the development of the revolutionary situation and the requirements of teaching. Therefore, the important current task is to organize the political study of teachers and staff in a planned and systematic way, with long-term planning, in conjunction with specific realities, linking to teaching, and appropriately unfolding criticism and self-criticism. The purpose is to establish a new attitude of serving the people while conducting professional study with focus and planning, in order to gradually achieve consistency between theory and practice in teaching and to implement political and ideological education.

B. Organization:

1.  Establish a Learning Committee, composed of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Education Workers' Union, and relevant parties, to form the "Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Learning Committee." Its main tasks are to establish learning guidelines and content, organize lectures, promote and supervise the learning progress of various schools. The Learning Committee will have an executive council to carry out specific promotion and organization work. (Detailed rules to be determined separately)
2.  Organization of school districts:
    1.  Middle schools will form units by school (if necessary, several schools can be combined), and primary schools will form units by district, to form their respective school or district learning committees, which will uniformly lead the learning of teachers and staff in each school district. Its members generally include principals, directors of teaching affairs, heads of the union's propaganda and education department, political instructors, and district cultural and educational section chiefs. Their task is, under the established guidelines and tasks of the Municipal Learning Committee, to organize and inspect the political and professional learning of teachers and staff, collect problems, summarize experiences, and report the situation to the Municipal Learning Committee on a regular basis.
    2.  The school district learning committees are divided into study groups. Middle schools can generally be grouped according to professional nature, while primary schools are grouped by school. When necessary, larger groups can be established as intermediate organizations for communication and liaison.

C. Content:

Taking the basic issues of the Chinese revolution as the central content, combined with current affairs and policies, and using "On New Democracy" as the main learning material, organize a systematic lecture series consisting of six lectures:

1.  Historical characteristics of the Chinese revolution; 2. History of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution; 3. New Democratic Politics; 4. New Democratic Economy; 5. New Democratic Culture; 6. The future of the Chinese revolution.

D. Method:

1.  Learning should be closely linked to ideological conditions and the reality of the Chinese revolution, promote free thinking, democratic enlightenment, and correctly use criticism and self-criticism.
2.  Each school district should have varying degrees of distinction in learning content and methods based on the differences in political and cultural levels of middle and primary school teachers and staff. Learning must focus on key points and solve major ideological problems, with the principle of less content but higher quality.
3.  Combine reports and assigned reference materials to strengthen self-study. Each school district learning committee should stipulate self-study time.
4.  The Learning Committee will publish "Beijing Teachers," whose main task is to promote and help learning. Except for necessary materials issued by the Municipal Learning Committee, general learning materials can be purchased by each school from their book fees, making every effort to provide various forms of assistance to learning. (Professional learning plan to be determined separately)

　　今年上半年学习计划
    【本报讯】北京市中小学教职员学习委员会制定的“一九五○年上半年学习计划”全文如下：
　　甲、方针
    当前旧教育的改造，教师质量的提高，基本关键是在于进一步提高教职员政治思想水平，并在其基础上提高业务水平。解放一年来，京市教职员政治学习是有一定成绩的，但一般还落在革命形势的发展及教学要求的后面，因此，目前重要任务，为有计划有系统地组织教职员的政治学习，要有长期打算，要结合具体实际，联系教学，适当展开批评与自我批评，其目的在树立为人民服务的新态度同时有重点有计划地进行业务学习，以期逐步地在教学中做到理论与实践一致，和贯彻政治思想教育。
　　乙、组织：
    一、设立学习委员会，由市文教局、市教育工作者工会筹委会会同有关方面组成“北京市中小学教职员学习委员会”，其任务主要是确立学习方针内容，组织讲座，推动和督促各校学习的进行，学委会下设干事会，执行具体推动和组织工作。（细则另定）
    二、各校区的组织：
    １、中学以校为单位（必要时可联合数校），小学以区为单位，组成各该校或区学习委员会，统一领导各校区教职员学习。其成员一般包括校长、教导主任、工会宣教部长、政治教员、区文教科长等，任务为在市学委会既定方针任务下，组织并检查教职员政治业务学习，搜集问题，总结经验，定时向市学委会汇报情况。
    ２、各校区学委会下分学习小组，中学一般可按业务性质分组，小学则以校为单位分组，必要时可设大组，作为传达连系之中层组织。
　　丙、内容：
    以中国革命基本问题为中心内容，结合时事政策，以新民主主义论为主要学习材料，组织系统讲座共分六讲：
    １、中国革命的历史特点；２、中国新民主主义革命史；３、新民主主义政治；４、新民主主义经济；５、新民主主义文化；６、中国革命的前途。
　　丁、方法：
    １、学习要与思想情况及中国革命的实际密切联系，发扬自由思考，民主启发，正确运用批评与自我批评。
    ２、各校区根据中学小学教员职员政治水平、文化水平之差别在学习内容和方法上也应有程度上之区别，学习必须抓着重点，解决主要的思想问题，内容以少而精为原则。
    ３、结合报告及指定参考材料，加强自学，各校区学委会应规定自学时间。
    ４、由学委会刊行《北京教师》，任务主要为推动和帮助学习，除必要材料由市学委会印发外，一般学习材料，各校可以图书费中购买，尽量做到给学习以各种帮助。（业务学习计划另定）
