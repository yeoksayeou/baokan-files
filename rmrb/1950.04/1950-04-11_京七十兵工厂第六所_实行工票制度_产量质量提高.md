　　Beijing No. 70 Ordnance Factory, Sixth Section

　　Implementing a Work Ticket System Increases Production and Quality

　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the Sixth Section of the Beijing No. 70 Ordnance Factory implemented the work ticket system in February, production and quality have continuously improved. The Operations Section is preparing to promote this system throughout all sections of the factory. Previously, the Sixth Section lacked precise methods for calculating work, relying only on a daily report based on production units, which the group leader would fill out each evening by asking each worker. Moreover, individual work assignments were not fixed, resulting in wasted work hours and inaccurate tracking of materials and scrap. Since implementing the work ticket system in February, the first step was to define the process for each type of work, create samples, and set tolerances. A quality control system was also established, and workers were required to fill out work tickets before taking on a job. Each person also had more fixed work assignments. The work ticket specified the name of the work piece, the work process, the number of pieces issued, the number of pieces scrapped due to worker or material issues, rework, the number of pieces passing inspection, the actual work time, machine number, and name. Because responsibilities were clearly defined in this way, it was easy to see the progress of each worker, thus greatly increasing the production enthusiasm of the workers. For example, Wei Zhiyi, a lathe operator, previously machined seven internal three-jaw chuck bodies per shift. In February, this increased to an average of 18.5 per day, with excellent quality. Zhang Kun ground three-jaw chucks, initially taking three hours per set. In February, the average time per set was reduced to one hour and thirty-seven minutes. At the same time, the scrap rate also decreased significantly. In the Machine Shop in February, fifteen out of thirty-three workers had no scrap. When making threading dies, the material was hard, making thread picking difficult. Through the workers' efforts to find solutions, such as Chu Zirong, a job requiring 19 work hours was completed in 11.5 work hours.

　　The remaining shortcoming is that the work tickets cannot be promptly transferred from the Inspection Department to the timekeeper, preventing timely statistics. This is because production is not yet standardized enough to allow for daily delivery of work. The goal for future efforts is: work tickets issued by the Work Section daily, inspected the same day, and transferred to the Section Office the next day, then returned to the Work Section. This will allow for daily tracking of production volume, scrap loss, etc.

### 京七十兵工厂第六所  实行工票制度  产量质量提高

　  京七十兵工厂第六所
    实行工票制度  产量质量提高
    【本报讯】京市七十兵工厂第六所从二月份实行工票制度以来，产量、质量不断提高。作业股正准备将这种制度推行全厂各所实行。六所过去没有精确的计工方法，只是以生产为单位的一张日报表，每日晚间由小组长挨着问了填上；加以每人工作不固定，所以既耗费工时，领料和废活也都不能精确统计。从二月份起实行工票制后，首先将每种工作定出程序，作好样板，定出差数。同时建立了检验制度，领活之前都要填写工票。每个人也较有了固定的工作。工票上注明工作品名、工作程序、发活数目、因工或因料废活数目、退修、检验合格数目、实作时间、机器号码和姓名等。因为这样职责分明，很容易看出每个人工作进度情形，因此工友生产情绪大为提高。如车工魏之一车三爪卡盘盘体内部，过去每工车七个，二月份提高到平均每日车十八个半，且质量都很好。张锟磨三爪卡盘，起初三小时一套。二月份每套平均只用一小时三十七分。同时，废品率也普遍降低。机工部二月份三十三人中有十五个人没有废品。在作板牙时，因为料硬，挑扣困难，经工人想办法努力去作，如褚子荣十九个工的活十一个半工就完成了。
    现在仍存在着的缺点是：工票尚不能及时由检验部转到记工员处。以致不能按时统计。这是由于生产尚不正规，不能做到每天一交活。今后努力的日标是：每天由工部发出工票，当天检验，第二天转到所部，再转回工部，这样就能看出每天的生产量，废活耗损等。
