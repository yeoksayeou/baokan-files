    Shangrao Concentration Camp
    Shao Yu
    In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of over 200,000 launched a perfidious attack on the more than 10,000 soldiers of the New Fourth Army in southern Anhui, who were persisting in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines both north and south of the Yangtze River and fighting arduously, creating the shocking Anhui Incident, known both inside and outside China. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic individuals imprisoned at that time. With skillful strokes and strong hatred and love, he depicted the facts he witnessed on that day, composing the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The heinous crimes of the Kuomintang secret agent bandits and the heroic deeds of the revolutionary fighters who would rather die than surrender are powerfully portrayed. This collection consists of twenty-three works, which will be serialized in this edition. Thirteen works have already been published; today, the fourteenth and fifteenth works are published.

    Comrade Li Ming was one of the active and courageous organizers among the twenty-plus female comrades in the concentration camp.
