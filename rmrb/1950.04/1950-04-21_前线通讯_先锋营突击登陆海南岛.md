    Vanguard Battalion Makes Assault Landing on Hainan Island
    War Correspondent Lu Yiding
    On the afternoon of March 5th, the vanguard battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army crossed 360 li of sea and landed on Hainan Island, victoriously joining forces with the fraternal troops of Qiongya, paving the way for the successful landing of the main force.
    When setting off on the afternoon of the 5th, the east wind blew strongly, and the soldiers jumped up happily, saying, "Chairman Mao has borrowed the east wind!" At 7:00 PM, more than a thousand warriors boarded the ships, formed a battle formation, and sailed swiftly southwestward, cleaving through the waves. At midnight, the wind suddenly stopped. At this time, there were still 160 li to the landing site. The soldiers were not alarmed and hurriedly rowed the boats with oars, continuing to advance.
    At dawn, the enemy on the coast of Hainan Island discovered them. Machine gun bullets and artillery shells kept shooting at the assault boats, but the soldiers still calmly rowed forward urgently. When the oars were not enough, they used bamboo poles and shovels together. Many people's hands were rubbed raw. When there were only ten li or so left to the destination, four enemy planes appeared in the sky, and bullets and bombs poured down frantically, causing the sea water to churn and the waves to splash. Comrade Song Rujin, a Communist Party member of the Seventh Squad, was hit by three bullets, but he still tried his best to shout, "Comrades! Row faster, landing means victory!" A boatman was injured in the buttocks, but he clenched his teeth and insisted on holding the rudder, his blood flowing into the bottom of the boat, dyeing the water in the boat bright red. Then two enemy warships appeared behind and opened fire on the No. 4 boat. Miao Yongcao, a soldier of the Eighth Squad, immediately asked the platoon leader, "Platoon leader, the enemy warship is coming, give me the demolition charge, I'll blow it up."
    Under the combined fire of the enemy's sea, land, and air forces, all the soldiers calmly rowed, patched holes, and pumped water. They only had one belief in their hearts: "Advance boldly and quickly, strive to be the first boat to land." Each boat flew forward like an arrow in the rain of bullets. In this way, the invincible warriors overcame the狂风巨浪, and broke through the enemy's sea, land, and air fire net.
    At 2:00 PM the next day, the No. 1 boat, fully loaded with the warriors of the "Jinzhou Hero Company," was like a sharp knife inserted straight into the beachhead. Under the resistance of an enemy battalion on the shore and the strafing and bombing of enemy planes, the warriors bravely and nimbly jumped into the water, which was neck-deep, and using the buoyancy of their backpacks, rushed towards the coast along the waves of the sea. Some soldiers used their rifle butts to support themselves on the seabed and leaped forward step by step. After three minutes of fighting, Liu Shibao, the squad leader of the "Siping Breakthrough Hero Squad," led the warriors of the entire squad through the 400-meter mudflat, reached the coast, and broke through the "Bo Ling Defense Line" that the bandits had boasted about day and night.
    Following this, the boats behind also landed one after another, and the majestic cheers of "We have landed on Hainan Island" immediately resounded on the beach. The panicked remnants of the bandits threw down their weapons and fled backwards for their lives. The warriors rushed forward regardless of fatigue, chasing and inserting fiercely. The Third Squad of the Third Company alone captured 21 bandits, including a bandit deputy company commander.
    Soon, on the mountain not far from the shore, the majestic and sonorous cheers of the vanguard battalion that had landed and the fraternal troops of Qiongya victoriously joining forces resounded. [Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 20th]

    先锋营突击登陆海南岛
    随军记者  路以丁
    人民解放军某部先锋营，在三月五日下午，横渡三百六十里海面，登陆海南岛，和琼崖兄弟部队胜利会师，为接应主力部队胜利登陆铺平了道路。
    五日下午出发的时候，东风大作，战士们高兴得跳起来说：“毛主席借了东风来啦！”傍晚七时，千余勇士登上了船只，排开战斗队形，向西南扬帆破浪急驶前进。午夜，风突然停了，这时距登陆地点还有一百六十里，战士们毫不惊慌，急忙用桨划船，继续前进。
    天亮时，海南岛沿岸的敌人发觉了，机枪弹、炮弹不断地向突击船射来，但是战士们仍然沉着地划驶急进，桨不够用了，就用竹篙、铁铲一齐干，很多人的手都磨出了血。当离目的地还有十余里时，四架敌机在天空出现了，子弹和炸弹疯狂地倾倒下来，打得海水翻滚，浪花四溅。七班党员宋如金身中三弹，还竭力喊着：“同志们！快划，登陆就是胜利！”一个船工的臀部挂了花，他咬着牙坚持不松舵，鲜血流进船底，把船里的水染得鲜红。接着两艘敌舰又在尾后出现了，向四号船开炮射击，八班战士苗永曹立即向排长要求：“排长，敌人的兵舰来了，你交给我爆破筒，我爆破它。”
    在敌人海、陆、空三面炮火合击之下，所有的战士们都镇定如常地划船、补洞、抽水，他们心中只有一个信念：“大胆迅速前进，争取登陆第一船。”各船都在弹雨中箭似地飞向前去。就这样，无敌的勇士们战胜了狂风巨浪，突破了敌人海、陆、空的火网。
    第二天下午二时，一号船满载了“锦州英雄连”的勇士们，像一把尖刀最先直插滩头。勇士们在岸上一个营的敌人的抵抗和敌机扫射轰炸下，勇猛敏捷地跳入深及颈际的水中，借着背包的浮力，顺着海水的浪头，扑向海岸。有的战士就用枪托拄着海底一步步跃进。经过了三分钟的搏斗，“四平突破英雄班”班长刘世保，带领全班的勇士涉过了四百米的泥滩，到达海岸，突破了匪军日夜吹嘘的“伯陵防线”。
    跟着，后面的船也一齐靠了岸，海滩上立刻响起了“我们登陆海南岛了”的雄壮的欢呼。惊慌失措的残匪们都一个个丢下武器没命地往后溃逃。勇士们不顾疲劳向前突击，猛追、猛插，仅三连三班就俘获匪副连长以下二十一人。
    不久，在距岸不远的山头上，就响起了登陆的先锋营和琼崖兄弟部队胜利会师的雄壮嘹亮的欢呼声。【新华社海南前线二十日电】
