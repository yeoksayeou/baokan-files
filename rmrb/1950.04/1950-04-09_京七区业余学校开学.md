　　Opening of the Jing No. 7 District Spare-time School
    [Our Dispatch] After a month and a half of preparation, the Jing No. 7 District Spare-time School officially opened on April 3rd. There were 170 industrial workers, 231 government cadres, 165 members of the Municipal Government Cleaning Team, and 194 odd-job men who signed up, for a total of 760 people. 17 classes were formed for Chinese language and 18 classes for arithmetic. According to the results of the tests, the general level of Chinese language was higher than that of arithmetic. However, in order to implement the teaching policy of balanced development, 60 people were exempted from studying Chinese language and specialized in studying arithmetic and other subjects. The arithmetic class hours for the others were generally increased, and the Chinese language class hours were reduced.
    At the opening ceremony, Principal Gu De said: "The establishment of the spare-time school is to enable workers and peasants to master modern knowledge and do a better job in revolutionary work. Therefore, we should regard cultural learning as one of the political tasks and as a part of our work." What excited people the most was that Comrade Xiao Ming from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Comrade Liao Mosha, Deputy Director of the Spare-time Education Work Committee, also came to speak, encouraging everyone to be determined to study diligently. Representatives of students and teachers spoke one after another, expressing their determination to guarantee the completion of the learning tasks. (Liu Zhongze)

　　京七区业余学校开学
    【本报讯】京市第七区业余学校经过一个半月的筹备，于四月三日正式开学。报名者有产业工人一七○人，机关干部二三一名，市府清洁队一六五名，勤杂人员一九四名，共七六○名。编国文十七班，算术十八班。据测验结果，一般的国文都比算术程度高。但为了执行平衡发展的教学方针，有六十人免修国文，专学算术等科目。其他一般的都加多了算术钟点，减少了国文钟点。
    开学典礼大会上，校长顾德说：“业余学校的成立是使工农分子掌握近代知识，把革命工作搞的更好。因此，我们应当把文化学习当做政治任务之一，当做工作的一部分。”使人们最感兴奋的是市总工会萧明同志及业余教育工作委员会副主任廖沫沙同志亦莅临讲话，勉励大家要下决心顽强地学习。学员代表、教员代表相继讲话，表示一定要保证完成学习任务。（刘仲则）
