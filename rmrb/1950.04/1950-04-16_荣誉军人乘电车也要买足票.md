To the Editor:

　　I am an honored serviceman. The last time I rode trolleybus number 126, I didn't have enough fare, and wanted to ride one stop further. But the ticket seller on the trolleybus wouldn't allow it, which I couldn't quite understand. Why can't they take care of us in such a small matter?

Comrade Dong Ping:

　　The answer to your question is as follows:

　　Now, the trolleybus company is the people's own enterprise, completely different from the way it was operated by bureaucratic capitalists in the past. Buying tickets is a reasonable right and obligation of the people, and it is also the policy of the People's Government to maintain the development of public enterprises. All expenses of the trolleybus company rely on ticket revenue to maintain, so situations of riding without a ticket cannot be allowed, so as not to affect revenue, cause loss of people's wealth, and hinder the development of production. Trolleybus fares are calculated by section, and you must buy a supplementary ticket if you ride past a section. Honored servicemen, like other passengers, should not be an exception, because everyone has the same responsibility to protect state property. Honored servicemen have certain preferential measures according to national regulations, and should not demand preferential treatment everywhere. Only in this way will they be more respected by the people, and only then will they be true revolutionary honored servicemen.

### 荣誉军人乘电车也要买足票

　　荣誉军人乘电车也要买足票编辑同志：
    我是一个荣誉军人，上次我乘坐一二六号电车，因所带车费不够，想多坐一站。但电车上售票员却不让，这使我思想有些打不通。请问为什么这点小事都不照顾我们呢？
                                            东平东平同志：
    你所提的问题，答复如下：
    现在电车公司已是人民自己的企业，与过去官僚资本经营的方式迥然不同。乘车购票是人民合理的权利与义务，亦是人民政府维持公营企业发展的政策。电车公司一切开支，依赖票款收入来维持，所以不能允许无票乘车的情况，以免影响收入，使人民财富遭到损失，妨碍生产的发展。电车票价系按段计算，乘车过段一定要补票。荣誉军人和其他乘客一样，都不应该有例外，因为爱护国家财产是人人有同样责任的。荣誉军人按照国家的规定，有一定的优待办法，不应该处处都要求优待，这样才更会受到人民的尊敬，才是革命的荣誉军人的本色。
