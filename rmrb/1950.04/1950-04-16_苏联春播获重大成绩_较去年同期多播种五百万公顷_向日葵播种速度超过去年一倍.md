　　The Soviet Union Achieves Significant Success in Spring Sowing
    5 Million Hectares More Sown Than in the Same Period Last Year; Sunflower Sowing Speed More Than Doubled Compared to Last Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th] Soviet spring sowing work has achieved significant success. According to a TASS report from Moscow on the 13th: As of the 10th, collective farmers and individual farmers had sown five million hectares of land more than in the same period last year.
    Several Union Republics and several provinces, as well as Ukraine and Kuban, the Soviet Union's two major granaries, have greatly exceeded their plans for sowing summer wheat and other grains. In the last five days, more northerly regions of the country, such as Voronezh Oblast, the Estonian Republic, and the Primorsky Krai in the Far East, have begun sowing early-maturing crops. Collective farms in southern Ukraine have already begun sowing maize.
    The sowing of sunflowers is proceeding at more than twice the speed of last year. In many regions of Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and Georgia, the sunflower sowing plan has been completed. In Kuban, which has large areas planted with sunflowers, the collective farms have completed 95 percent of the plan.
    Cotton growers in Central Asia and Transcaucasia had planted more than half of their land by the 10th.
    In Ukraine, the main sugar beet growing area, nearly 50 percent of the sugar beet planting plan has been completed. The Central Asian republics have also almost completed their sugar beet sowing.
    The warm climate and abundant rainfall in the southern regions of the country in recent days have created favorable conditions for the growth of summer crops.
    The machine and tractor stations have begun plowing fallow land for winter crops much earlier than last year. They have now plowed two million hectares of land.

　　苏联春播获重大成绩
    较去年同期多播种五百万公顷  向日葵播种速度超过去年一倍
    【新华社十五日讯】苏联春播工作已获重大成绩。据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：截至十日为止，集体农民与个体农民已较去年同期多播种了五百万公顷土地。
    若干加盟共和国与若干州以及苏联两大谷仓的乌克兰与库班，均已大大超过了播种夏季小麦以及其他谷物的计划。在最近五天内，国内更北的地区，如佛罗内兹州、爱沙尼亚共和国和远东的滨海区，已开始了早熟作物的播种。乌克兰南部的集体农场，已经开始播种玉蜀黍。
    向日葵播种的进行速度超过去年一倍。在乌克兰、北高加索和乔治亚的许多州内，已经完成了播种向日葵的计划，拥有大片种植向日葵的土地的库班，各集体农场已经完成了计划的百分之九十五。
    中亚细亚和外高加索的植棉者，到十日为止，已经种植了他们园地的一半以上。
    在主要的甜菜种植区乌克兰，种植甜菜的计划已经完成了近百分之五十。中亚细亚各共和国也已差不多完成了甜菜播种。
    国内南部地区的和暖气候与近数日所降的丰富雨量，创造了夏季作物生长的有利条件。
    各机器和拖拉机站已开始耕耘种植冬季作物的休耕地，时间远较去年为早。现在，它们已经耕耘了二百万公顷的田地。
