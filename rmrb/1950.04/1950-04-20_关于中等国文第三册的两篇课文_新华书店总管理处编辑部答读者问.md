To the Editor:

The eleventh and twelfth lessons, "When the Sun Takes a Vacation," in the third volume of the Intermediate Chinese Language textbook published by Xinhua Bookstore, are a story-like piece of scientific writing. However, based on my research with some colleagues, we believe that some Chinese language teachers, due to a lack of scientific knowledge, may give students incorrect understandings when teaching this. The lesson is clearly a piece of scientific writing, but the exercises say it is a "story-like popular science text." I think this teaching material needs to be carefully studied. But who is the author of this article? Where did it come from? We have no way to find out. I hope you can help us answer these questions.

In addition, typos in the Chinese language textbook should also be brought to the attention of the editors. For example, in this lesson, there is a sentence: "There are many waterfalls in the world, flowing down from high places. We can install some water mills and turbines there, letting (浪?) the water flow hit the wheel, causing the wheel to rotate and drive the generator." The word "浪水" (lang shui - wave water) is obviously unclear. Is it "water wave?" Or should it be "让水流冲在轮上" (rang shui liu chong zai lun shang - letting the water flow hit the wheel)? —I am afraid it is better to change it to "让" (rang - let). Also, in the second lesson, "Individual and Collective" (Liu Shaoqi), in the fourth volume of the book, in the second paragraph, there is a sentence that says: "They often unconsciously destroy the Party's organization and discipline in unprincipled factional struggles..." The word "不" (bu - not) in "不自觉" (bu zi jue - unconsciously) is missing in the book. That makes a big difference in meaning.

Comrade Liu Shidi:

The Xinhua Bookstore General Administration Editorial Department has the following reply to your comments:

(1) Chinese language teachers may have some difficulties teaching the eleventh and twelfth lessons, "When the Sun Takes a Vacation," in the third volume of the Intermediate Chinese Language textbook. We sincerely hope that junior high school Chinese language teachers in various places will make more preparations when teaching this lesson, refer to natural science books, or consult with geography teachers to avoid giving students incorrect answers.

(2) "When the Sun Takes a Vacation" is just a "story" and not a pure "scientific text." It is a bit inappropriate to say that it is a "story-like popular science text" in the "exercises" after the lesson. This teaching material is selected from "Ulabola Story Collection" written by Bergiel and translated by Gu Junzheng. This book is one of the World Children's Literature Series published by Kaiming Bookstore.

(3) The "浪" (lang - wave) in the phrase "浪水流冲在轮上" (lang shui liu chong zai lun shang - wave water flow hitting the wheel) in the text is a mistake for "让" (rang - let). This is a oversight in proofreading.

(4) In the sentence "他们常常是自觉的..." (ta men chang chang shi zi jue de... - they are often consciously...) in the second paragraph of the second lesson, "Individual and Collective" in the fourth volume, the original work does not have the word "不" (bu - not) before "自觉" (zi jue - consciously); Judging from the following sentence "故意的打击某些人" (gu yi de da ji mou xie ren - deliberately attacking some people), the word "不" (bu - not) should not be used here either.

### 关于中等国文第三册的两篇课文  新华书店总管理处编辑部答读者问

　　关于中等国文第三册的两篇课文
    新华书店总管理处编辑部答读者问编辑同志：
    新华书店出版的中等国文第三册，第十一、十二两课“太阳请假的时候”，是一篇故事性的科学文字。但据我与周围一些同志研究的结果，认为部分国文教员，由于缺乏科学知识，讲这篇东西时，很可能给学生错误的认识。课文明明是一篇科学小品，但习题里却说是“故事性的科学通俗文字”。我觉得这篇教材须要加以很好的研究。但该文的作者是谁？从那里选择来的？我们却无从查起。希望你们能帮助我们解答。
    另外，国语课本上的错字，也是应该提起编著者很好的注意。比如这篇课文中一句：“世界上有不少的瀑布，从高的地方流下来，我们可以在那里装些水磨和轮机，浪（？）水流冲在轮上，使轮子回转开动发电机。”“浪水”这个词，显然是不明确的，究竟是水浪？或是“让水流冲在轮上”？——恐怕改为“让”字较妥。又如该书第四册第二课“个人与集体”（刘少奇）的第二小节中，有一句话说：“他们常是不自觉的在无原则的派别斗争中破坏党的组织与纪律……”书上把“不自觉”的“不”字丢掉。那意义的差别是很大的。
                              安阳一中  刘士弟刘士弟同志：
    你所提出的意见，现经新华书店总管理处编辑部答复如下：
    （一）中等国文第三册第十一、十二两课“太阳请假的时候”，国文教师在教学时可能有些困难。我们很希望各地的初中国文教师在教这一课的时候，多作些准备，参考自然科学的书，或者请教地理先生，以免对学生作出错误的解答。
    （二）“太阳请假的时候”，只是一篇“故事”，并不是纯正的“科学文字”，在课文后的“习题”里面说是“故事性的通俗科学文字”，是有点欠妥当的。这篇教材是从柏吉尔著，顾均正译的“乌拉波拉故事集”里选出。这本书是开明书店出版的世界少年文学丛刊之一。
    （三）课文中“浪水流冲在轮上”，“浪”为“让”之误。这是校对工作上的疏忽。
    （四）第四册第二课“个人与集体”的第二节“他们常常是自觉的……”句，查原著“自觉”上边并没有“不”字；就下文“故意的打击某些人”句看来，这里也应该不用“不”字。
