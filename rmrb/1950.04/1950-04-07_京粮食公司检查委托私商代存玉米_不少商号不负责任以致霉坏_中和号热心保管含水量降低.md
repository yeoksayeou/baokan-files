[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing branch of the Grain Company inspected corn entrusted to privately-owned rice and flour businesses for storage and discovered that some had already become moldy. Rectification is underway, or compensation is being demanded according to the contract. The company previously transported a large quantity of corn from the Northeast. Due to warehouse capacity limitations, it contracted with 230 privately-owned rice and flour businesses to store it. Recently, with the arrival of warmer spring weather, in order to prevent mold, the company organized inspection teams. The results showed that many businesses held a purely profit-driven viewpoint and were irresponsible in their storage, failing to regularly turn and air the corn, leading to mold. For example, Fuchangyong stored 43,000 jin of corn. Despite repeated urging to air it, no attention was paid, and more than 30,000 jin have become moldy. Jinliuju stored 40,000 jin, which has all become moldy. In addition to demanding compensation from these businesses that do not cherish state property and do not abide by contracts, the company will report them to the government for handling according to the severity of the circumstances. Furthermore, twenty businesses, including Yufengde, did not air the corn thoroughly enough, resulting in minor losses, which have been rectified in a timely manner, and they have been educated and warned. At the same time, some businesses managed the storage very well. For example, Zhonghe Company stored 500,000 jin. To facilitate turning and airing, they changed three large stacks into eighteen small stacks, with each stack equipped with a ventilation shaft. All employees diligently aired the corn, resulting in a reduction in moisture content from 17% to 20% to 15% without causing any losses, which is worthy of commendation. The facts of this inspection also show that the company's past work was not thorough enough, and inspections were not timely. The company must strengthen its efforts in this area in the future and also pay close attention to the conditions of the storage businesses.

　　京粮食公司检查委托私商代存玉米
    不少商号不负责任以致霉坏
    中和号热心保管含水量降低
    【京市新闻处讯】粮食公司北京分公司检查委托私营米面商号代为保管的玉米，发现有的已经霉坏，正进行纠正或按照合同令其赔偿。该公司前由东北运到大批玉米，因仓库容量所限，订约委托二百三十户私营米面商号代为保管。近以春暖，为防止霉坏，该公司分组加以检查，结果有多数商号抱着单纯营利观点，保管不负责，不经常倒晒，以致使玉米霉坏。如福昌永保管玉米四万三千斤，几经督促晾晒，均未引起注意，已有三万余斤霉坏；晋六居保管四万斤，已全部霉坏。该公司对这些不爱护国家财产不遵守合同的商号，除将令其赔偿外，并将依情节轻重报请政府处理。另有裕丰德等二十家商号晾晒不够彻底，损失轻微，已及时纠正并教育警告。同时也有些商号保管很好，如中和号保管五十万斤，为便于倒晒，由三个大囤改成十八个小囤，每囤置一通风筒，全体职工并勤加晾晒，结果原来很湿的玉米由百分之十七到百分之二十的含水量降低到百分之十五，未造成损失，值得表扬。这次检查的事实亦表明该公司过去工作欠深入，检查不及时，今后该公司在这方面尚须力加改进，对保管户的条件也应很好注意。
