　　Beijing's Declaration of Inventory Tax Supplementation Largely Completed
    Unscrupulous Merchants Still Concealing and Failing to Report; Municipal Tax Bureau Should Organize Manpower for Inspection
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Beijing's declaration of inventory tax supplementation and the tax bureau's verification of tax returns have been largely completed. According to statistics from the Municipal Tax Bureau, as of April 3rd, the city's inventory tax supplementation has only brought in tax revenue equivalent to about five million catties of millet, and a portion of the tax is still being collected. After the promulgation of the unified National Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax on February 1st, the Municipal Tax Bureau, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Tax Administration, began handling inventory tax supplementation in early February. The reasons why this tax supplementation work proceeded relatively systematically are mainly as follows: First, at the beginning of the new Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax, due to the increased number of detailed items compared to the past, some tax cadres had concerns about "many difficulties in implementation." In response to the above situation, Bureau Chief Zhao Zishang of the Tax Bureau first convened all cadres and gave an explanatory mobilization report on the new tax law, which was very helpful in dispelling the confused thoughts of some cadres and encouraging everyone's work enthusiasm. Second, symposiums were held successively with the heads of various industry trade associations, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the responsible persons of public enterprises, repeatedly explaining to them the significance and methods of inventory tax supplementation and promptly answering the questions they raised. This reduced the difficulties in the implementation process, so the market was very calm during the work. Third, a reporting and notification system was established to unify the tax amount and implementation steps; and mass feedback could be collected at any time to improve the work in a timely manner. Fourth, it was clearly stipulated that silk, linen, wool, cotton products, hardware, and electrical materials with larger tax sources were the focus of inventory tax supplementation.
    According to the new Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax, there are many categories of taxable goods, and Beijing's various goods are relatively scattered, with handicraft products being the most prominent. Due to manpower constraints, the Municipal Tax Bureau adopted a self-reporting and tax verification method. This gave unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to exploit loopholes. The following are some of the methods of tax evasion that have been discovered: First, transferring taxable goods to conceal them from reporting, or underreporting. Second, declaring low-priced goods to the tax bureau in an attempt to pay less tax. Third, retail goods are not affixed with stamps, and the stamps are kept for future transportation of goods; or stamps that have already been affixed are torn off and affixed to goods that have not been taxed. If the tax authorities can organize forces to conduct timely inspections to make unscrupulous merchants wary, this kind of tax evasion will be greatly reduced. Although the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau has repeatedly announced to merchants to declare within a time limit, and those who are found to be overdue will be punished; however, because the inspection work has not been universally and deeply carried out, the phenomenon of tax evasion is still quite serious. Beijing's inventory tax supplementation work is still ongoing, and the Municipal Tax Bureau, in addition to urging some merchants who have verified the tax but have not yet paid it into the treasury to pay quickly, should seize the final opportunity to organize manpower for inspection, which is very necessary to ensure the completion of the national tax revenue task.

### 京市申报存货补税大体完成  仍有不法商人隐瞒不报市税局应组织人力检查

　　京市申报存货补税大体完成
    仍有不法商人隐瞒不报市税局应组织人力检查
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市申报存货补税、税局就表核税工作已大体完成。据市税务局统计，截至四月三日止，全市存货补税仅收入税款约五百余万斤小米，尚有一部税款正催缴中。全国统一的新货物税暂行条例于二月一日公布后，市税务局根据中央税务总局的指示，即于二月初旬开始办理存货补税。此次补税工作所以进行得比较有条理，主要有下面几个原因：一、新货物税暂行条例颁布之初，由于细目较前增加，部分税务干部存在着“执行起来困难多”的思想顾虑。针对上述情况，税局赵子尚局长首先召集全体干部，作了新税法的解释动员报告，对于解除部分干部的糊涂思想、鼓励大家的工作积极性甚有帮助。二、先后召开了各行业同业公会负责人、工商联合会筹备委员及公营企业负责人的座谈会，反复向他们说明了存货补税的意义和办法，并及时解答了他们提出的问题。这样就减少了执行中间的困难，所以工作进行中市面甚为平静。三、建立了汇报、通报制度，使税额大小及执行步调得以统一；并能随时收集到群众的反映，能及时改进工作。四、明确规定税源较大的丝、麻、毛、棉制品、五金及电料等为存货补税的重点。
    按照新货物税暂行条例规定，应税货物品类较多，京市各种货物又较分散，其中以手工业产品为最甚。市税务局由于人力限制，采用自报核税的办法。这就给了不法商人钻空子的机会。已发现的偷漏税款的方式有下面几种：一、将应税货品转移隐瞒不报，或以多报少。二、以低价货物向税局申报，想少纳税。三、零售商品不贴印花，将印花留待将来货物外运时再贴；或将已贴过的印花撕下，再贴到未经完税的货物上。税务机关若能组织力量及时进行检查，使不法商人存有戒心，则此种偷漏税款现象，必将大大减少。京市税务局虽曾一再布告商民，令其限期申报，逾期被查获者，将受到处罚；但因稽查工作尚未普遍深入展开，因此偷漏税款的现象仍相当严重。京市存货补税工作尚在继续进行，市税务局除督促部分已核税而尚未纳库的商人迅速缴纳外，应抓紧最后机会，组织人力进行检查，这对于保障国家税收任务的完成是十分必要的。
