　　Rent Increases Must Be Reasonable
    Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau Responds to Mr. Liu Jizhi
    Question:
    After liberation, I rented four rooms (extremely narrow bungalows) from Mr. Tian. At that time, both parties agreed that the rent would be 70 catties of flour per month, but with a condition attached, that it could be adjusted after the People's Government announced measures for handling rents. Therefore, in August of last year, my landlord and I went to the Third Inner District Office to mediate this matter. As a result, both parties agreed on 70 catties of millet per month, paid according to the wholesale market price in the People's Daily, and a mediation agreement was established. Now, the landlord, citing the government's land tax as a reason, wants to raise the rent again; I have not agreed because I cannot afford it. We are currently at a standstill.
    Now I ask you:
    (1) Can rent be increased arbitrarily after mediation?
    (2) What method should I use to handle this matter?
    No. 5, Dehua Lane, Dongsi 6th Street, Liu Jizhi
    Answer:
    Your attitude is very good that you and the landlord have a problem with the amount of rent, and at the same time you hope to find a reasonable solution as soon as possible. The answers to the two questions raised are as follows:
    1. Regarding the question "Can rent be increased arbitrarily after mediation?" we believe that although the rent has been negotiated through a mediation process, if there is still a phenomenon of low rent when measured according to the general reasonable rental situation at this stage, the landlord may propose a readjustment or apply for a new mediation. As to whether the reasons for the landlord's proposal or application are sufficient, of course, it depends on the specific situation. Therefore, the issue is not whether the rent can be increased arbitrarily, but whether the rent is reasonable.
    2. Regarding the question "What method should I use to handle this matter?" we believe that: before your problem is resolved, you should pay the rent according to the original agreement. As for the future agreement on the rent amount, it is best to adopt a free agreement method, and if necessary, ask a friend to mediate. If a solution cannot be reached, either the landlord or the tenant can apply to the original mediation department for re-mediation in order to seek a reasonable solution. This is a more appropriate way to handle it.

            Who Should Pay Property Tax?
    Question: Should the property tax be paid by the landlord or the tenant? If there is a prior contract stipulating that the tenant pays, how should it be handled?
    Answer: Property tax is a property tax and is levied on the property owner. However, if there is another contract agreement, it will be handled according to the agreement.

### 房租涨价必须合理  京市民政局答刘季之君

　　房租涨价必须合理
    京市民政局答刘季之君
    问：
    我在解放后曾租得田姓房子四间（平房极狭隘）。当时双方言明房租每月面粉七十斤，但有附带条件，即人民政府处理房租办法公布后可以调整。因此在去年八月间，我和房东到内三区区公所调处此事，结果双方同意每月伏地小米七十斤，按人民日报市场批发价付款，并立有调解书。现在房东以政府征收地皮税为词，又要涨房租；我以无此负担能力，故未允。现正在僵持中。
    现在请问你们：
    （一）房租是否经调处后，可以随便涨价？
    （二）我用何办法处理此事？
    东四六条德华里五号  刘季之答：
    你与房东因房屋的租额发生了问题，同时很希望得到一个合理办法早点解决，这种态度是很好的。兹将所提两个问题解答如下：
    一、所问“房租经调处后，可否随便涨价？”一点，我们认为房租虽经调解过程议定的，但根据现阶段一般合理的租赁情况来衡量如仍有低租现象时，房主得提议重新调整或声请重行调解。至于房主提议或声请的理由是否充足，当然要看具体情况如何为断，因之问题不在房租可否随便涨价，而在于租金是否合理。
    二、所问“用何办法处理此事？”我们认为：在你们的问题未能解决前，应依原约缴付租金，至于将来租额的议定，最好采自由协议方式，必要时可托友人居间折衷。如得不到解决办法，则主客任何一方可向原调解部门声请再调解，以求合理解决，这样办是比较妥当的。

            房产税应由谁缴纳？
    问：房产税应由房主缴纳还是由房客缴纳？若先有契约由房客纳如何处理？
    答：房产税是财产税之一，向产权所有人征收。但另有契约协议者从其协议。
