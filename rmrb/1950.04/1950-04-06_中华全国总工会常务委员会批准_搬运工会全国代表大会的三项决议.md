In order to avoid exploitation by merchants and to protect transport workers from the impact of price fluctuations as much as possible, the First National Congress of the Chinese Transport Workers' Union deems it necessary to organize consumer cooperatives for transport workers in various cities (towns, county seats). The resolution is as follows:

	1.	The transport workers' consumer cooperative should serve its members wholeheartedly, without the purpose of making profits and distributing dividends. It should absorb and concentrate the share capital of transport workers and their families as the cooperative's fund, purchase daily necessities for transport workers, and distribute them to members in fixed quantities.
	2.	The transport workers' consumer cooperative is a mass economic organization under the leadership of the transport workers' union, based on the principle of voluntary shareholding. The cooperative committee shall be elected by the members' congress or the members' representative congress. The cooperative committee shall report on the cooperative's affairs to the members' congress or the members' representative congress on a regular basis. In terms of business, the consumer cooperative shall receive guidance from the municipal (county, town) cooperative federation.
	3.	Local transport workers' consumer cooperatives may request preferential treatment and convenience from the local municipal (county, town) people's government, the cooperative federation, and state-owned trading organizations in accordance with regulations.
	4.	Existing transport workers' consumer cooperatives in various places should be rectified and improved according to the above principles and the specific conditions of the cooperative. Those that have not yet been established should be promptly prepared.

	1.	The sources of funds for solving the difficulties of illness, injury, disability, and death, etc., for transport workers in each city (county seat, town) are:

		F. Those who have not joined the trade union can only receive half of the benefits under items A, B, C, D, and E.
	5.	Any transport worker applying for a subsidy must fill out an application form, which must be evaluated by the trade union group, approved by the primary trade union committee, and approved by the labor insurance committee before it can be received.
	6.	The original mutual aid customs of workers in various places shall remain the same.
	7.	Existing free regulations in local hospitals shall remain the same.
