　　Shanxi Holds Health Work Conference
    Determines This Year's Work Tasks
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Shanxi Provincial Department of Health convened the first provincial health administrative conference from the 2nd to the 8th. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Department of Health conveyed the summary of the First National Health Conference of the Central Ministry of Health. The health workers attending the meeting unanimously supported the general principle of "prevention first, treatment second" decided by the National Health Work Conference, and in connection with this, criticized the province's past work methods of emphasizing treatment and neglecting prevention. They recognized that infectious disease prevention, maternal and child health, industrial and mining hygiene, and health care work all urgently needed to be carried out. At the same time, they reviewed the phenomenon of detachment from the masses that still existed in hospital treatment work. The meeting listened to and discussed the report on the guiding principles and tasks of Shanxi Province's health work in 1950, and decided to carry out health work such as vaccination, immunization, transforming old-style midwives, and organizing and transforming traditional Chinese medicine.
