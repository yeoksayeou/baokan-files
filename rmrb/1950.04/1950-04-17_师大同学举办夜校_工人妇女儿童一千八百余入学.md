　　Normal University Students Organize Night School
　　Over 1,800 Workers, Women, and Children Enroll
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The adult night schools and children's night schools organized by Normal University students have achieved results. More than 250 students from Normal University have established six night schools in the 9th and 7th districts of the city for workers, shop assistants, women, adults, etc., with 984 students divided into 34 classes. There are four children's night schools with 25 classes and 850 students. In terms of teaching materials, the children's night schools use the primary school textbooks stipulated by the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education; the textbooks for adult night schools are compiled by themselves. Children love to listen to stories most. They often rent picture books on the streets, and teachers, in response to this situation, often tell stories of labor heroes during lectures, and add popular books with various new contents to the school, and later they no longer go out to read picture books. Adult night school students urgently demand practical knowledge, and teachers focus on explaining current events, public bonds, rat plague, the significance of the "March 8th" Festival, etc., which are very popular. The rapid progress of the students has strengthened the confidence of the students. In the children's night school, although there are only two or three hours of study time each day, when the examination questions from the affiliated primary school are used to test them, their results are no worse than those of the affiliated primary school. For example, the performance of the sixth grade is similar to that of the sixth grade of the affiliated primary school. One student in the children's night school wrote and staged a play himself, which was performed at the Ninth District Support the Army Conference. In adult night schools, some illiterate women can recognize 300 to 500 characters after three or four months of study; some can already write articles, not only run their own wall newspapers, but also sometimes contribute to the Normal University Study Newspaper. The progress in thought is particularly significant. Most housewives never participated in gatherings in the past, but now they are all very happy to participate in every mass meeting in the district and automatically act as security guards, and often go on stage to speak. Some students have joined the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, and some have served as leaders of public security groups. One woman started a literacy class at home to help others learn. Another student became the principal of the night school.

　　师大同学举办夜校
　　工人妇女儿童一千八百余入学
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：师大同学举办成人夜校及儿童夜校已获成绩。师大有二百五十多同学在本市九区和七区办工人、店员、妇女、成人等夜校六所，学生有九百八十四人，共分三十四班。儿童夜校四所，有二十五班，学生八百五十人。教材方面，儿童夜校采用了市文教局规定的小学课本；成人夜校的课本则由自己编。儿童们最爱听故事。他们常到街头上租小人书看，教师针对这种情形，便在讲课时常讲劳动英雄的故事，并在校内增添各种新内容的通俗的书籍，后来他们就不再出去看小人书了。成人夜校学员迫切要求实用知识，教员就偏重地讲解时事、公债、鼠疫、“三八”节的意义等，很受欢迎。学生的飞快进步，加强了同学的工作信心。在儿童夜校中每天虽只二、三小时的学习时间，但是把附属小学的考试题拿来测验他们，其成绩并不比附小的坏，如六年级的成绩和附小六年级的差不多，儿童夜校一学生自己编剧、排剧，曾在九区拥军大会上演出。在成人夜校里，有些文盲妇女经过三、四个月的学习，可以认三百到五百字；有人已能写文章，不但自己办壁报，有时还在师大学习报上投稿。思想上的进步，尤其显著，大部分家庭妇女，过去从不参加集会，但现在区里每开群众大会，夜校的妇女全很高兴地去参加并自动当纠察，还常常上台讲话。有些学生中已加入了共产党或青年团，还有的担任了公安小组长，有一个妇女自己在家里创办了一个识字班，帮助别人学习。另一个学生当了夜校校长。
