Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th (TASS): Soviet workers are launching labor competitions with greater vigor to achieve new successes in socialist industry to greet May Day. News of new production victories is coming from all over the country every day. Metallurgical workers in Outer Baikal are fighting for new achievements in increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, and saving money, raw materials, and fuel. The blast furnace workers of the Ural New Tagil factory were the first to complete the first quarter plan of this year, and compared with the same period last year, the production of pig iron increased by 8.5 percent. The factory has launched a mass socialist competition to win the title of Excellent Quality Work Team. The personnel of the Gorky State Shipbuilding Factory in the Gorky region passed a resolution to build several more ships than planned this year. Workers at the Gorky Automobile Factory guarantee to greet May Day with production targets that greatly exceed those of March and April. Among the textile workers in the Ivanovo region, many work teams have independently set tasks to exceed the daily quota by 20 percent and to produce 99 percent of first-class goods. The large-scale Ivanov factory has assumed the obligation of teaching 130 young textile workers to learn the Stakhanovite working methods. Now, there are more than 150 Stakhanovite workers in the enterprise engaged in the work of educating young workers. In Baku, five oil production trusts of oil workers who have completed the first quarter plan for oil and gas production will celebrate May Day with new labor achievements. They have learned to extract oil from the depths of the seabed. This is another proof of the increased industrial strength of the Soviet Union and the proficiency of Soviet oil workers.
