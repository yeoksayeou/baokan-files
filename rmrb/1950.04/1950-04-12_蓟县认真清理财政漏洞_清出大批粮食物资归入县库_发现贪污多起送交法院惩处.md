　　Ji County Seriously Clears Fiscal Loopholes
    Clears Out Large Quantities of Grain and Materials to Be Returned to the County Treasury, Discovers Multiple Cases of Embezzlement and Transfers Them to the Court for Punishment
    [Report from this newspaper] Ji County has begun to seriously clear up past fiscal loopholes. In the past six months, a large amount of grain, materials, and multiple cases of embezzlement and illegal activities have been uncovered. Individual embezzlers have been severely punished. In the past, the county had more or less bureaucratic work styles in its leadership, lacked serious management of public grain, and did not strictly enforce the system. During the support for the liberation of the Beijing-Tianjin Campaign, a large amount of grain was centrally transferred, and financial procedures were chaotic. In addition, frequent transfers of financial cadres and unclear handover procedures resulted in significant grain loopholes. Since last October, the county government has instructed various districts to seriously clear up fiscal loopholes. The county granary and finance section have also drawn eight capable cadres to assist the districts. Thanks to the close combination and active efforts of the upper and lower levels, by March of this year, the following materials were cleared and returned to the treasury: 105,939 jin of millet, 18,955 jin of wheat, 15,088 jin of coarse grains, 7,752 jin of public firewood, 27,399 jin of gasoline, 5,402 jin of lubricating oil, 2,370 new sacks, and 443 cotton military uniforms. Some of these materials were war booty and deposits from the troops. After the troops left, the villages did not report it. A large part of it was privately used by district and village cadres and falsely reported. In addition, individual district and village cadres and bad elements falsely reported losses and weight deductions, and embezzled from it. Wang Han, a financial assistant in the Fourth District, embezzled public grain to smoke opium. He has been removed from his post and investigated, and sentenced to five months in prison by the County People's Court. The borrowed grain was recovered, and the embezzled portion was deferred for supplementary payment. During the support for the liberation of the Beijing-Tianjin Campaign, the Erdianzi Village in the Sixth District established a village granary with 300,000 jin of grain stored. Li Shutong, a junior township cadre in the village, Chen Liansheng, a security guard, and Liu Wenyuan, the granary director, conspired with other cadres to cheat. They used a large scale for intake and a small scale for outtake. The public grain increased by 2,000 jin. They also falsely reported a loss of 4,770 jin, concealing a total of 6,770 jin of public grain. In addition to using 4,300 jin for village expenses, twelve village cadres divided an average of 1,760 jin of wheat, 700 jin of millet, and 180 jin of salt. After the government discovered this situation, it immediately dismissed and arrested Li Shutong, Chen Liansheng, Liu Wenyuan, and other three people, and handed them over to the County People's Court for trial. Other cadres were given criticism and education. In order to take care of their difficult lives and embezzled grain, the repayment was deferred. Xu Yuyin, a financial and grain committee member of Yanggezhuang Village in the Second District, and four others embezzled 2,000 jin of rice. During the cleanup, the grain has been recovered and returned to the warehouse. Xu Yuyin, the mastermind of the embezzlement, was sentenced to two years in prison. In the public grain deposited in Dajugezhuang in 1948, 2,494 jin of rice and 1,871 jin of wheat were missed. Village cadres Meng Qingsheng and Meng Qinglai and others attempted to embezzle and falsely report the losses. It was not until February of this year that villager Meng Zhaoyin discovered and reported it to the district before it was cleared and returned to the warehouse. The County People's Court has sent people to the village to investigate Meng Qingsheng and others for further processing.
    Organize Village Finances and Reduce Village Expenses
    In the process of clearing up, village finances were also reorganized, and strict regulations were formulated. All village expenditures must be approved by the village assembly and reviewed and approved by the district government. Otherwise, the villagers have the right to refuse. As a result, village expenditures have been generally reduced. Except for education grain, other expenditures are rare.
    Although the cleanup work in the past six months has achieved considerable results, strictly speaking, the investigation is still not thorough enough, and there are still many financial and grain loopholes that have not been cleared up. Some problems have not been dealt with in a timely manner. For example, in the Ninth District, 53 village cadres in ten villages misappropriated 33,720 jin of public grain and 48,275 jin of public firewood in 1946. After a delay of four years, no action has been taken. Therefore, the cleanup work in Ji County still needs to be carried out in depth. The county government has now decided that financial and grain cadres should conduct in-depth cleanup of financial loopholes without hindering production. They should focus on it before the wheat harvest, and combine it with appraisal and quota setting after the wheat harvest to conduct a general cleanup. All the grain scattered in various villages in the past for the convenience of supporting the war must be collected and returned to the warehouse.

　　蓟县认真清理财政漏洞
    清出大批粮食物资归入县库  发现贪污多起送交法院惩处
    【本报讯】蓟县开始认真清理过去财政漏洞，六个月来，清查出大批粮食物资及贪污违法案件多起，对此个别贪污分子并已进行了严厉惩办。该县过去在领导上或多或少地存有官僚主义作风，对公粮缺乏认真管理，执行制度不严格。在支援解放京津战役时，大批粮食集中调运，财政手续紊乱。又加上财政干部调动频繁，手续交待不清楚，因此粮食漏洞很大。从去年十月，县府指示各区认真清理财政漏洞，县粮库和财政科又抽调八名能力较强的干部，分赴各区予以协助。由于上下级的密切结合和积极努力。到今年三月，共清理入库物资计有：小米十万零五千九百三十九斤，小麦一万八千九百五十五斤，粗粮一万五千零八十八斤，公柴七千七百五十二斤，汽油二万七千三百九十九斤，滑机油五千四百零二斤，新口袋二千三百七十条，棉军装四百四十三件。这些物资，一部是战争缴获品和部队插存的。部队走后，村中亦未报告；其中一大部分即为区村干部私自动用和虚报空头；另有个别区村干部和坏分子假报损失折秤，从中贪污搞鬼。四区财政助理员王涵，贪污公粮抽大烟，已撤职查办，并送交县人民法院判处徒刑五个月，追回外借粮食，缓期补交贪污部分。六区二店子在支援解放京津战役时，设立村粮库，存粮三十万斤。该村小乡干部李树桐、治安员陈连生、粮库主任刘文元，主谋勾串其他干部搞鬼，大秤入小秤出，公粮涨秤二千斤，又假报亏秤四千七百七十斤，共隐瞒公粮六千七百七十斤。除作村开支用了四千三百斤外，十二名村干部共平均分了一千七百六十斤小麦，七百余斤小米、一百八十斤食盐。此种情况经政府查出后，当即把李树桐、陈连生、刘文元等三人撤职逮捕，交县人民法院审判。其他干部给以批评教育。为了照顾他们生活困难，贪污粮食，缓期交回。二区杨各庄财粮委员徐玉银等四人，贪污大米二千斤，在清理中，已把粮食追回入库。徐玉银主谋贪污，判徒刑二年。大巨各庄在一九四八年插存的公粮中，漏下大米二千四百九十四斤，小麦一千八百七十一斤，被村干孟庆生、孟庆来等企图贪污假报损失，直延至今年二月，经村民孟昭印发觉报区后才清出入库。县人民法院已派人去该村调查孟庆生等情节再予处理。
    整理村财政  村开支缩减
    在清理中，又整理了村财政，严格规定各种制度，一切村开支要经过村民大会通过与区政府审核批准，否则村民有权拒绝。因此，各村村开支普遍缩减，除教育粮外，其他开支很少。
    半年来的清理工作，虽然成绩不小，但严格说，清查仍不够十分深入，财粮漏洞未清理出来的仍不少。有些问题处理的也不及时，如九区有十个村五十三名村干部，在一九四六年擅自动用公粮三万三千七百二十斤，公柴四万八千二百七十五斤、延迟四年之久，尚未作任何处理。因此，蓟县清理工作，还需深入展开。现在县府已决议：财粮干部在不妨碍生产的前提下，深入进行清理财政漏洞，在麦收前有重点的搞，麦收后结合评产定量，普遍清理，凡过去为了便于支援战争，分散在各村的粮食均须扫数集中入库。
