Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a statement here regarding the CCP Central Committee's directive issued to all party members on March 25th to strengthen unity with democratic figures and the broad masses, stating: After reading the full text of the CCP Central Committee's directive issued on March 25th, we feel the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party's spirit of serving the country and the people with utmost impartiality under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The main purpose of this directive is, of course, to educate CCP members "who have committed the mistake of closed-doorism"; however, the CCP Central Committee's "humble" and "open-minded" sincere attitude makes us, as democratic party members with minimal contributions to the liberation movement, feel infinite shame and a need for deep self-reflection. Chairman Mao calls on the Communist Party members who led the Chinese revolution to success to "learn from others" and "practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members," so shouldn't we strive to learn from the CCP and practice unity and cooperation with CCP members? Therefore, we now call on all members of the China Zhi Gong Party to work harder from now on, emulate CCP members, use a self-critical attitude, enhance the spirit of serving the people, support the national policies set down in the Common Program, actively support the People's Liberation Army, and earnestly implement democratic cooperation with all democratic parties, especially the CCP, to truly manage state affairs well.

　　致公党主席陈其尤发表谈话
    学习中共自我批评精神  努力加强与各党派合作
    【新华社广州三日电】中国致公党主席陈其尤在此间就中共中央三月二十五日对全体党员发布的加强团结民主人士及广大群众的指示发表谈话称：我们读了中共中央三月二十五日所发布的指示全文，使我们觉得中国共产党在毛主席领导之下为国为民、大公无私的精神之伟大。这个指示的主要目的，固然是为着要教育“犯有关门主义毛病”的中共党员；但中共中央这种“谦逊”和“虚怀若谷”的诚恳真挚的态度，实是使作为民主党派人士的我们，对于解放运动极少贡献的我们，感觉无限的惭愧和应该深自反省的。毛主席对于领导中国革命成功的共产党员，尚且号召他们“应该跟别人学习”、“应与党外人士实行民主合作”，而我们还不应该努力跟中共学习，与中共党员实行团结合作吗？所以，现在我们号召所有中国致公党党员，应该从今以后，要加倍努力，向中共党员看齐，用自我批评的态度，提高为人民服务的精神，拥护共同纲领所定下的国策，积极支援人民解放军，切实和各民主党派，尤其是和中共，实行民主合作，把国事真正办好起来。
