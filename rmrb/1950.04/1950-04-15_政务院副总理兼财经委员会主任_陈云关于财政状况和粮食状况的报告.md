Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The following is the full text of the report on the financial and grain situation by Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council and Director of the Financial and Economic Commission (delivered at the Seventh Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on April 13, 1950):

On the Financial Situation

The first issue I want to report to this Government Committee meeting is about the financial situation.

In the four months since the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the 1950 National Financial Budget in December last year, the nation's financial situation has improved. More than 70% of the autumn grain levy has been put into storage. With the exception of the Southwest region, where collection is still underway due to the later liberation, the vast majority has been collected throughout the country. In areas liberated earlier last year, tax revenue is also gradually increasing. By now, 72% of the first phase of national bonds has been received. The staffing of public employees is currently being formulated, and the total number of military, government, public, and educational personnel nationwide has not exceeded the figures listed in the budget, and may even be reduced appropriately. In the past four months, relevant financial and economic departments of the Central People's Government have held many professional meetings to further define the business and financial plans for this year. Over the past four months, a portion of the state's financial revenue has been actually received, and the revenue has increased compared to that listed in last December's financial budget due to the liberation of the Southwest. On the expenditure side, after four months of accounting, it is now more accurate than when the budget was passed. Comparing revenue and expenditure, although there is still a deficit, it has narrowed by two-fifths compared to the 1950 budget. The first two months of this year were a period of preparation for unified financial and economic management, and the national financial deficit for those two months was still significant. However, if calculated from March this year, the financial revenue and expenditure for the subsequent ten months will have an even smaller deficit. On average, it can approach a balance. If tax revenue and public bonds are completed according to the original plan, if the portion of public grain sold and the products of state-owned enterprises can be sold on schedule, and currency is withdrawn from circulation; if there are no major changes in revenue and expenditure, then the issuance of banknotes needed for financial revenue and expenditure can be reduced to a minimum, and the nation's financial situation and prices can begin to improve. Our people have suffered greatly from inflation. If we can stop inflation and stabilize the financial situation and prices, it will meet the people's hopes and the country's economic needs. Therefore, striving to achieve this is the responsibility of the Central People's Government.

Achieving Financial Balance Will Stabilize Finance and Prices

That the nation's financial revenue and expenditure are approaching balance even before the war is completely over is thanks to the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, which quickly liberated mainland China; thanks to the hard work of military, government, public, and educational employees nationwide, who live a hard life; and especially thanks to the enthusiastic payment of public grain, taxes, and purchase of public bonds by the people of the whole country. Without these joint efforts, it would not be possible to achieve a near balance in financial revenue and expenditure and relative stability in finance and prices. Therefore, I hope that the people of the whole country and all military, government, public, and educational employees will continue to work together, overcome difficulties, and achieve the further improvement of the financial economy, finance, and prices that everyone hopes for.

It should be said that as long as the people of the whole country and the government work together, this hope is not a fantasy, but is entirely possible to achieve. The most important basis for this is that, according to the current plan, financial revenue and expenditure are already close to balance, which is fundamentally different from last year. Last year, finance and prices experienced four major fluctuations, and there were considerable fluctuations in January and February this year. This is because last year the national financial deficit accounted for two-thirds of total expenditure. After each fluctuation last year, there was a period of relative stability in finance and prices, but that stability was temporary and not because the financial deficit had shrunk. On the contrary, the monthly increase in military and government expenses led to a monthly increase in the financial deficit, which caused instability in finance and prices. Some temporary stability last year was either due to the expansion of liberated areas, which expanded the area where the Renminbi circulated; or because several commodities happened to be on the market and prices did not rise. Because the short-term stability at that time was based on the above conditions and not on the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, the subsequent fluctuations were inevitable. The current situation is different: revenue and expenditure are close to balance, the financial deficit is minimal, and the government has made the necessary preparations for certain major materials that must be controlled for the purpose of adjusting military and civilian needs and market prices. If a small amount of banknotes may still be issued each month thereafter, the main reason will no longer be to fill the deficit in the financial budget. This is a fundamentally different situation from last year.

For the past twelve years, the people and industrial and commercial sectors of the whole country have been in an environment of inflation, and their lives and business methods have inevitably adapted to the past environment. However, it must be seen that the environment is beginning to change. In view of the major losses and much suffering experienced by all the people and legitimate industrial and commercial sectors due to the change from the stable finance and prices before the war to the inflation of the subsequent twelve years, the transition from long-term fluctuations in finance and prices to stability must also be regarded as a difficulty. Especially because the people's purchasing power has been greatly reduced after twelve years of war, and some industries and businesses have long embarked on the path of speculation. Therefore, I hope that industrial and commercial sectors nationwide will see this transition and make the necessary preparations, work together with the government to overcome the difficulties in the transition, and jointly strive for a better situation. I also hope that those who have made a living by speculating through inflation in the past will change their past behavior and turn to legitimate business operations to avoid disadvantages to the country and themselves. It should be seen that the difficulties in the transition are difficulties in turning from bad to good, and therefore only temporary difficulties. Continued price declines are also detrimental to the national economy. If prices continue to fall, the government will take appropriate steps to stabilize them.

The Focus of Financial and Economic Work in the Coming Months Will Be on Adjusting Industry and Commerce

Sorting out revenue and expenditure and reducing the deficit is only a part of the financial work. There are still many shortcomings in the work that has been done, which need to be corrected. There are still many major problems in the financial and economic aspects that need to be resolved urgently. For example, there have been phenomena of excessively light or heavy burdens in the collection of public grain, which should be corrected; the current tax regulations must be reviewed in light of actual conditions during implementation, and those that are inappropriate should be revised; the tax burden and public bond sales should reach a reasonable and appropriate level; it is necessary to rectify the bad work style of some staff members in the collection work, train tax personnel, and prevent corruption and tax evasion; the mutual relationship between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises must be adjusted so that the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests" is reflected in actual policies and specific measures; continue to improve labor-capital relations in private enterprises; improve the management of public factories; reduce the blindness in the production and business of public and private enterprises, and gradually increase planning, etc. To this end, the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council plans to hold several necessary meetings in the next few months, formulate several necessary laws and regulations, and focus on adjusting industry and commerce. In the six months since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the focus of the work of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council has been on finance, which was absolutely necessary, and therefore achieved the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices. In the next few months, in addition to adhering to all the correct guidelines and policies in the financial work and correcting the deviations that have occurred in the work, the focus should be shifted to adjusting industry and commerce, and making possible and necessary achievements.

Regarding Last Year's Disasters, This Year's National Grain Preparation and Disaster Relief Work

The second issue I want to report to this Government Committee meeting is about last year's disasters, this year's national grain preparation and disaster relief work. The disasters that occurred in many areas last year were significant. The reason why the disasters were significant is fundamentally due to the long-term destruction caused by the Japanese imperialist war of aggression and the Kuomintang reactionary counter-revolutionary war supported by American imperialism, and the long-term destruction of production and water conservancy by the imperialist Kuomintang reactionary rule. However, from a national perspective, last year's overall harvest was not bad. Except for a very small part of drought, last year's disasters were all floods. Many places in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Shandong in East China, and Hebei and Pingyuan in North China, suffered severely. Individual places in the provinces of Central China, Southwest China, Northeast China, and Northwest China also experienced some disasters, but in general, it was a normal harvest year. Some provinces were above normal, and some provinces were lower than normal, but close to normal. Even in the provinces and regions with severe disasters, not all areas were affected. There is also a distinction between severe and light disasters in disaster areas. But it should be said that last year's disaster was very severe. A total of 121.56 million mu of farmland in the country were affected to varying degrees, and about 40 million disaster victims were affected to varying degrees. Among them, the concentrated large areas of severe disaster accounted for more than 28 million mu, and about 7 million severely affected victims were in the greatest need of relief. Since last winter, the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels have been using various methods to provide relief to disaster victims and help them overcome difficulties. There are now two questions: One is whether the national grain supply will be insufficient this year due to last year's disaster? Will there be major difficulties? The other is whether disaster victims can survive this year's spring famine?

Regarding the National Grain Supply This Year. Last year was a year of very severe disasters, but if we compare it with the situation in 1931, when there was a major flood in the country, last year's disaster was still lighter. According to the report of the Kuomintang Government Relief Flood Committee in 1932: In 1931, 157.785 million mu of farmland were affected in eight provinces, including: 41.78 million mu in Jiangsu, 32.82 million mu in Anhui, 17.28 million mu in Hubei, 10.79 million mu in Hunan, 29.30 million mu in Henan, 17.16 million mu in Shandong, 5.47 million mu in Jiangxi, and 3.25 million mu in Zhejiang, totaling 52.71 million disaster victims. That is to say, in 1949, there were 36.29 million mu less of disaster farmland and 12 million fewer disaster victims than in 1931. In other words, unlike 1931, there was a harvest in 1949 on this unaffected 36.29 million mu of farmland. When calculating this harvest volume, it is necessary to estimate that the average yield after the war is lower than in 1931 before the war, but the average yield per mu of farmland will not be lower than 200 jin, so in terms of the reduction of disaster farmland, 7.2 billion jin, or 3.6 million tons, were harvested more than in 1931.

The Government Has Made Full Preparations for the Grain Needed in Various Places This Year

Let's look at the grain supply after the flood in 1931 and compare it with the preparations made by the Central People's Government in this regard this year. In 1932, the year after the major flood in 1931, grain imports, including those from the Northeast, totaled 2.24 million tons. After this imported grain was used for regulation, not only was the famine survived, but the phenomenon of low grain prices harming farmers occurred in many provinces. This imported grain figure should be used as an important reference material for calculating this year's grain supply after last year's flood. Our grain preparations this year are: 1.03 million tons from the Northeast, 200,000 tons from Sichuan, and about 300,000 tons that can be transported out from some areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Hankou railways, which are now open to traffic, but could not be transported out in 1932 when the railways were not open. If necessary, grain entering the pass from the Northeast can also be increased. At the same time, we are also prepared to purchase some foreign grain when necessary. Even if we take the aforementioned three items into account, we are not far from the grain import figure in 1932. If the grain entering the pass from the Northeast is increased and the import of foreign grain is not hindered, the difference will be even smaller. This is a comparison in terms of grain preparation. If we take into account that there were 36.29 million mu less of disaster farmland last year than in 1931, and the people harvested 3.6 million tons more, then this year's grain supply will not be worse than in 1932.

It should be estimated that after twelve years of war, the national farmland yield has decreased, and the people's grain reserves this year are also lower than in 1932. But it is also necessary to estimate one fact, that is, due to the inflation of the past twelve years, most urban people have purchased and stored a certain amount of grain in order to reduce the loss of currency depreciation. In terms of grain consumption, due to the poverty caused by the long-term war, the people's grain consumption is elastic. In the case of high grain prices, people generally eat coarser and thinner food.

In order to Guarantee People's Food Supply, Grain is Being Transferred

In order to ensure the food supply for the people of the whole country, the government is carrying out grain transfers. On the one hand, a considerable amount of public grain is being transported from areas with inconvenient transportation but surplus grain to transportation lines using various methods. On the other hand, a certain amount of public grain is being transported from provinces that had a good harvest last year and have historically had a surplus of grain, within the limit of the amount of grain that has been exported in previous years, to provide relief to disaster areas and large cities.

The cost of transportation is very high. In many places, the freight exceeds the grain price. On average, the freight is equal to the grain price. But although the freight is high, disaster victims and the surplus labor force in rural areas have obtained the freight. Such transfers are necessary for the whole country and beneficial to the farmers in surplus grain areas. If the national public grain in the surplus grain areas is not transported to disaster areas and large cities, but sold directly to farmers, the grain price will fall sharply, causing low grain prices to harm farmers. On the other hand, if there is insufficient grain in large cities, it will inevitably increase the cost of industrial products, and the result will not only be difficult for the people in large cities, but also the farmers in the surplus grain areas will inevitably suffer from low grain prices and expensive industrial products. The purpose of the government's grain transfer is to transfer the surplus grain in remote areas to transportation lines that can be mobilized, which can both advance and retreat. Only with such scheduling and deployment can the grain needs of the whole country be supplied.

Coastal cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which have long relied on foreign grain imports, will be supplied by domestic grain this year. Many people are worried that grain panics will occur in large cities because the seaports are blocked. We believe that, except for individual seaport cities that may experience temporary grain difficulties this year due to extremely inconvenient inland transportation and temporary blockades from the outside, all large cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Nanjing, as well as provincial cities, will receive the necessary grain supply. This year alone, the amount of national public grain, including the public grain after the wheat levy, that needs to be sold on the market, excluding the Northeast, is 9 billion jin, or 4.5 million tons. The population of towns and cities of all sizes across the country does not exceed 90 million, and this 4.5 million tons can supply the annual food supply for more than one-third of the urban population. The state supplies cities with such a large amount of grain, which is the first time in Chinese history.

A Total of More Than 1.53 Billion Jin of Grain for Various Disaster Relief Efforts

Regarding the issue of providing relief to disaster victims. In the two provinces of Liaoxi and Rehe in the Northeast, there are 12 million mu of disaster farmland and 2.6 million disaster victims. The Northeast People's Government is providing relief. This year, the Central People's Government used the following amount of grain in various ways to provide relief to disaster victims within the pass: 340.4 million jin of relief grain, 345.64 million jin of water conservancy work-relief grain, 94.8 million jin of agricultural loan grain, 120 million jin of cooperative investment grain, 200 million jin of transportation price grain for disaster victims, 126.35 million jin of grain for purchasing native cloth from disaster victims, and 145 million jin of coarse grain loaned to farmers to be returned after the wheat harvest, and 160 million jin of local relief grain. The above eight items total 1.53229 billion jin, or 766,000 tons. If necessary, it can also be increased appropriately. Let's look at the China Economic Yearbook and the report of the Kuomintang Government Relief Flood Committee at that time. How much relief grain was used in 1932? The amount: 32.04 million jin of relief grain, 60 million jin of work-relief grain, and 10 million jin of agricultural loans and seeds, totaling 102.04 million jin, or 510,200 tons. According to the same material, at least 300 million jin, or 150,000 tons, were not transported to the disaster areas. According to the above materials, there are 12 million fewer disaster victims this year than in 1932, and 255,800 tons more grain is used for relief, and all of it will be transported to the disaster areas. If there was corruption and embezzlement in disaster relief during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, then the People's Government will absolutely not allow disaster relief personnel to be corrupt.

We Will Certainly Be Able to Overcome the Spring Famine. The Imperialists are Destined to be Disappointed

Our method of providing relief to disaster victims is to organize disaster victims to produce and help themselves. The government's relief grain is used to assist disaster victims in carrying out various productions, rather than simply distributing it and ignoring production. As long as the work is done well, as long as we continue to work hard, it is entirely possible to assist disaster victims in overcoming the spring famine.

The lives of disaster victims are very hard, and the lives of the general people are also very difficult. This is the result of more than 100 years of imperialist aggression against China and the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Precisely because of this, the people of the whole country are determined to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule and establish their own people's government after defeating Japanese imperialism. The victory of the People's Liberation War and the establishment of the Central and local governments at all levels have created the prerequisite for transforming the national economy. The people of the whole country understand this, and the people of the whole country are standing with the government, working together to eliminate the remaining enemies, restore the economy, and overcome difficulties.

The imperialists are gloating, and the small group of reactionaries exiled on the islands are also dreaming of a grain crisis occurring on the mainland. Let them dream. Reports from the Northeast, North China, and Henan and Shandong provinces (excluding Jiaodong) have reported widespread spring rains, and the wheat harvest is promising. Farmers across the country are entering spring plowing. Those who are gloating and hoping that we will have a grain crisis are destined to be disappointed. Contrary to their expectations, we will not only overcome the famine, but what will appear before us will be stable grain prices that have not been seen for many years.

　　政务院副总理兼财经委员会主任
    陈云关于财政状况和粮食状况的报告
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府政务院副总理兼财政经济委员会主任陈云关于财政状况和粮食状况的报告（一九五○年四月十三日在中央人民政府委员会第七次会议上），全文如下：
    关于财政方面的状况
    我要向此次政府委员会报告的第一个问题，是关于财政方面的状况。
    去年十二月二日第四次中央人民政府委员会会议通过一九五零年国家财政概算之后，四个月来，国家的财政情况已有好转。秋征公粮百分之七十多已经入仓，除西南地区，因解放较迟正在征收外，全国各地已经最大部分征起。去年解放较早的地区，税收亦在逐步增加。今年第一期公债，截至目前止，已实收百分之七十二。目前公教人员的编制正在制定，全国军政公教人员的总数，尚未超过概算所列的数字，并且还可能酌量减少。四个月来，中央人民政府有关财经各部门开过许多专业会议，进一步规定了今年度业务和财务计划。四个月来，国家的财政收入一部分已经确实收到，而且收入方面，因为西南已经解放，比去年十二月财政概算岁入所列有了增加；支出方面，经过四个月核算，已经比通过概算时更加确实。收支相较，虽然仍有赤字，但比一九五零年概算所列已经缩小五分之二。今年一、二两月，是统一财经管理的准备时期，那两个月的国家财政赤字仍然不小。但如从今年三月份起计算，此后十个月的财政收支，赤字必将更小。平均算来，可以接近平衡。如果今后税收及公债按照原定计划完成，如果公粮的出售部分和国营企业产品能够按期脱售，回笼货币；如果收支方面没有重大的改变；则由于财政收支所需的增发钞票，可以减到极小限度，全国金融物价就可以开始好转。我国人民已经饱受通货膨胀之苦，如果能停止通货膨胀，使金融物价稳定起来，这是符合于人民的希望和国家的经济需要的。因此，努力实现这一点，是中央人民政府的责任。
    在战争还未完全结束的时候，国家财政收支已接近平衡，这应该感谢人民解放军英勇作战，迅速解放了中国大陆；感谢全国军政公教职工，他们努力工作，而过着艰苦的生活；尤其要感谢全国人民踊跃交纳公粮、税款和购买公债。没有这些共同努力，要达到财政收支接近平衡，金融物价比较稳定，是不可能的。因此，希望全国人民和全体军政公教职工，继续共同努力，克服困难，实现大家所希望的财政经济、金融物价进一步的好转。
    财政收支接近平衡  金融物价必能稳定
    应该说，只要全国人民与政府共同努力，这种希望不是空想，是完全可能实现的。最主要的根据是，照现行计划，财政收支已经接近平衡，这是与去年根本不同之点。去年金融物价经过四次大波动，今年一、二月也有相当的波动，这是因为去年国家财政的赤字，占全部支出的三分之二。去年每次波动之后，短时期中虽也有过金融物价比较稳定的状态，但那种稳定是暂时的，并不是因为财政赤字缩小了。相反的，由于军政费用逐月增加，使得财政赤字逐月增大，造成了金融物价的不稳定状态。去年的某些暂时性的稳定，是因为当时或者由于解放地区的扩大，人民币流通地区随之扩大；或者由于若干商品适逢上市季节而价格未升。因为那时短期的稳定是建立在上述的条件上面，不是建立在财政收支的平衡上面，因此，继之而来的波动，就是不可避免的。目前则不同：收支接近平衡，财政赤字极小，为了调剂军民需要和市场价格之目的而必须掌握的某几种主要物资，政府已有必要的准备。如果此后每月还可能增发少许钞票的话，那末，主要原因已不是为了填补财政预算上的赤字。这是与去年根本不同的情况。
    全国人民和工商界过去十二年是处在通货膨胀的环境中，他们的生活和经营方法不能不适应过去的环境。但是，必须看出，现在环境正在开始转变。鉴于由战前的金融物价稳定变为以后十二年的通货膨胀，全体人民和正当的工商业界，受过重大的损失，经历了许多痛苦。现在由金融物价长期的波动走向了稳定，也须看作是一种困难。尤其因为经过十二年战争之后，人民的购买力已大大降低，有些工商业已长期走上投机取巧的道路。因此，希望全国工商界看到这种转变，而预作必要的准备，与政府共同努力，克服转变中的困难，共同争取更好的局面。也希望过去依通货膨胀投机取巧为生的人，改变过去的行为，转入正当的经营，以避免对于国家和自己的不利。应该看到，转变中的困难是由坏转好的困难，因此只是暂时的困难。物价继续下降对于全国经济也是不利的，如果继续下降，政府当采适当步骤稳定之。
    今后数月财经工作重心在调整工商业
    整理收支，缩小赤字，仅仅做了财政工作的一部分，已经做的工作还有不少缺点，需要纠正。财经方面还有许多重大问题，急待解决。例如：征收公粮中有过畸轻畸重的现象，应加改正；现行税则在执行中还须根据实际情况加以审查，其中不合适者，应该修正；税款负担和公债推销，应该达到合理和适当的程度；必须整顿一部分工作人员在征收工作中的不良作风，整训税务人员，防止贪污偷漏；国营企业和私营企业之间的相互关系必须予以调整，使“公私兼顾”的原则在实际政策和具体办法上表现出来；继续改进私营企业中的劳资关系；改善公营工厂的管理；减少公私企业生产和业务上的盲目性，逐渐增加计划性等等。为此，政务院财经委员会准备在今后几个月内召开若干必要的会议，拟订若干必要的法令，并将重心放在调整工商业方面。中央人民政府成立以来的六个月中，政务院财经委员会的工作重心是放在财政方面，这是完全必要的，因而达到了平衡收支，稳定物价的目的。今后数月的工作，除坚持财政工作方面一切正确的方针和政策，并纠正工作中发生的偏向以外，应将重心转到调整工商业方面去，并做出可能和必要的成绩。
    关于去年的灾情，今年的全国粮食准备工作和救灾工作。
    我要向此次政府委员会议报告的第二个问题，是关于去年的灾情，今年的全国粮食准备工作和救灾的工作。去年许多地区发生的灾情是重大的。灾情之所以重大，根本上是日本帝国主义侵略战争和美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派反革命战争长期破坏的结果，是帝国主义国民党反动统治对生产和水利长期破坏的结果。但从全国说来，去年的整个收成还不算坏。去年的灾害，除极小部分是旱灾外，都是水灾。华东的皖北、苏北、山东，华北的河北、平原共五个省区的不少地方，受灾很重。华中、西南、东北、西北各省的个别地方，也有些灾情，但一般是平年收成。有些省在平年以上，有些省略低于平年，但也接近平年。即在灾重的各省区，并非全部都有灾情。灾区中又有重灾、轻灾之分。但应该说，去年的灾情是很重的。合计全国被灾程度不同的农田一万万二千一百五十六万亩，受灾轻重不同的灾民共约四千万人。其中集中的大块的重灾区，共占二千八百余万亩，最需要救济的重灾民约有七百万人。中央人民政府和各级地方人民政府自去冬以来，正用各种方法救济灾民，帮助灾民克服困难。现在的问题有两个：一个是由于去年遭灾，今年全国的粮食供应是否不足？会不会发生大困难？另一个是灾民能否渡过今年的春荒？
    关于今年全国粮食供应问题。去年是灾情很重的一年，但如果拿过去全国大水灾的一九三一年的情况来比较，则去年的灾情还是较轻的。根据伪国民政府救济水灾委员会在一九三二年的报告：一九三一年八个省的受灾农田一万万五千七百八十五万亩，计：江苏四、一七八万亩，安徽三、二八二万亩，湖北一、七二八万亩，湖南一、○七九万亩，河南二、九三○万亩，山东一、七一六万亩，江西五四七万亩，浙江三二五万亩，共计灾民五千二百七十一万人。这就是说，一九四九年的灾田比一九三一年的灾田少三、六二九万亩，灾民少一千二百余万人。也就是说，这个未受灾的三、六二九万亩农田上，比一九三一年不同，一九四九年有了收获。计算这个收获量时，要估计到战后平均产量比战前的一九三一年为低，但每亩田的平均产量总不会低过二百市斤，这样，就灾田减少这点来说，比一九三一年多收了七十二亿斤，即多收了三百六十万吨。
    今年各地所需粮食  政府已有充分准备
    再来看看一九三一年那次水灾之后的粮食供应，并把今年中央人民政府在这方面的准备工作，作个比较。一九三一年大水灾的次年，即一九三二年，粮食进口，包括东北进关在内，共二二四万吨。经过这个进口数字的粮食调节之后，不但渡过了灾荒，而且在许多省份发生了谷贱伤农的现象。这个进口粮食数字应该作为去年水灾之后计算今年粮食供应的一种重要的参考材料。我们今年的粮食准备是：东北入关一○三万吨，四川运出二十万吨，由于浙赣、粤汉两铁路现已通车，其沿途的若干地区，在一九三二年时因铁路未通运不出，现在则可运出的，约有三十万吨。如有必要，东北进关粮食还可增加。同时，我们也准备在必要时，购进若干外国粮食。即拿前述三项计算，我们比一九三二年进口粮食数字已经相差不远。如东北增加入关粮食，外粮进口又不受阻挠，则相差更少。这是粮食准备方面的比较。如果计算到去年灾田比一九三一年少三、六二九万亩，民间曾多收获三百六十万吨，则今年粮食供应将不会较一九三二年为差。
    应该估计到十二年战争之后，全国农田产量降低了，今年比一九三二年时，民间粮食的存底也薄了。但又要估计到一项事实，即是由于十二年来的通货膨胀，城市人民为了减少货币跌价的损失，大多购存了一定数量的粮食。就粮食的消费说，因为长期战争造成的贫困，人民的吃粮量是有弹性的，在粮贵的情况下，一般是吃得粗一点，吃得稀一点。
    为了保证民食  正在调运食粮
    为了保证全国的民食，政府方面正在进行粮食调运。一方面由交通不便但有余粮的地区用各种方法运出相当数量的公粮到交通线上。另一方面，又从去年收成较好历来又有余粮出境的省区，在不超过历年出境粮食的限度内，运出若干公粮接济灾区和大城市。
    调运费用是很大的，许多地方运费超过了粮价，平均计算，运费等于粮价。但是运费虽大，灾民和农村的剩余劳动力取得了运费。这样的调运，对全国有必要，对余粮区的农民也有利。如果余粮区内的国家公粮不运到灾区和大城市，而就地与农民竞卖，则粮价将大跌，造成谷贱伤农的情况。另一方面，大城市如果粮食不足，必使工业品成本提高，其结果不仅大城市人民发生困难，余粮区的农民也必然受到粮食贱、工业品贵的痛苦。政府调运粮食的目的是把偏僻地区的余粮调到可以机动的交通线上，既可以进，又可以退，只有这样的调度和部署，才能供应全国的粮食需要。
    像上海、天津、广州这样的沿海大城市，曾经长期依赖外国进口粮食，今年则将由国内粮食来供应。许多人，因为海口被封，担心大城市发生粮食恐慌。我们认为，除因内地交通十分不便而暂时又被外面封锁的个别海口城市，今年可能感到一时的粮食困难外，所有北京、天津、上海、广州、武汉、南京等等大城市及各省城市均将得到必需的粮食供应。今年单是国家的公粮，包括麦征之后的公粮在内，需要在市场上出售的数量，除东北外，就有九十亿斤，即四百五十万吨。全国大小城镇的人口，不超过九千万，此四百五十万吨，即可供应三分之一以上城镇人口全年食粮。国家以如此大量的粮食供应城市，这在中国历史上还是第一次。
    各项救济灾民的粮食  共十五亿三千余万斤
    关于救济灾民问题。东北的辽西、热河两省灾田一千二百万亩，灾民二百六十万人，东北人民政府正在救济。今年中央人民政府以各种方法用于救济关内灾民的粮食数量如下：救济粮三四、○四○万斤，水利工赈粮三四、五六四万斤，农贷粮九、四八○万斤，合作投资粮一二、○○○万斤，灾民运输的运价粮二○、○○○万斤，收买灾民土布粮一二、六三五万斤，借给农民粗粮待麦收后归还者一四、五○○万斤，地方救济粮一六、○○○万斤，以上八项，共计十五亿三千二百余万斤，即七十六万六千吨。如有必要，还可酌量增加。我们再看中国经济年鉴所载，当时伪国民政府救济水灾委员会的报告，用在一九三二年的救济粮共有多少？计：救济粮三二、○四○万斤，工赈粮六○、○○○万斤，农贷种子等一○、○○○万斤，共计十亿二千零四十万斤，即五十一万零二百吨。根据同一材料所载，其中至少有三亿斤，即十五万吨，并未运到灾区。根据上述的材料，今年灾民比一九三二年少一千二百余万人，用于救济的粮食则多了二十五万五千八百吨，并将全部运到灾区。如果国民党反动统治时期，对救灾方面还有贪污中饱，那末人民政府对救灾人员是绝不允许贪污的。
    我们一定能够战胜春荒  帝国主义者注定要失望
    我们救济灾民的方法，是组织灾民生产自救，政府的救济粮食用在协助灾民进行各种生产上面，而不是只管发放、不管生产的单纯救济办法。只要工作做得好，只要继续努力，是完全可以协助灾民战胜春荒的。
    灾民生活是很苦的，一般人民的生活也很艰难，这是百余年来帝国主义侵略中国和国民党长期反动统治的结果。正因为如此，全国人民决心在战胜日本帝国主义之后，迅速推翻国民党反动统治，建立人民自己的政府。人民解放战争的胜利，中央以及各级人民政府的成立，已为改造国家经济创立了前提。全国人民是懂得这一点的，全国人民正和政府站在一起，同心协力，消灭残敌，恢复经济，战胜困难。
    帝国主义者正在幸灾乐祸，流亡在海岛上的一小群反动分子也在梦想大陆上发生什么粮食危机。让他们去做梦吧，东北、华北、及河南省、山东省（除胶东区）的报告，已经普降春雨，麦收已经有望，全国农民正在进入春耕。那些幸灾乐祸，希望我们发生粮食危机的人们，是注定了要失望的。和他们的预料相反，我们将不但要战胜灾荒，而且在我们面前出现的，将是多年来未有过的粮价平稳。
