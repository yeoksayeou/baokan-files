Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 15th: The People's Liberation Army's Fifth Army stationed in Xinjiang is actively building water conservancy projects and carrying out spring farming. The directly subordinate units and the troops stationed in Yili are using 50,000 laborers to repair the 40-kilometer-long Royal Canal from Yining to Huiyuan and its branch lines. Construction began on March 24, and more than 30 kilometers were completed within nine days, accounting for 80% of the entire project. Once the canal is completed, it can irrigate more than 320,000 mu of land. While participating in water conservancy construction, a certain regiment actively launched spring farming. By the 2nd of this month, nearly 20,000 mu of irrigated and dry land had been sown in more than 20 days, completing 60% of the regiment's task. Other units of the department have also actively launched spring farming. The total agricultural production target of the entire army this year is to reclaim 163,620 mu of wasteland, with an estimated harvest of 7,362 tons and 900 kilograms of coarse and fine grains.
　　
The entire army carried out thorough preparations before production. From the headquarters down to the various units, companies were organized into production teams and production groups of 50 to 110 people. Soldiers with agricultural tool repair skills were concentrated to establish small-scale iron and wood factories, which have already produced 500 large carts capable of carrying two tons. In addition, surveying teams composed of commanders and fighters with agricultural production experience and water conservancy technicians were dispatched to Yili, Ashan, and Tacheng to survey arable land and water conservancy conditions before construction began on the canals and spring farming. More than 800 tons of various seeds were prepared. Since March 24, new large carts manufactured by the farm tool factory, the units' trucks, and old large carts have been transporting grain, firewood, and equipment to the reclamation areas and the Royal Canal construction site day and night. Tents, yurts, or flat-roofed houses have been set up in the reclamation areas and construction sites, and production and construction work is being carried out enthusiastically in the barren mountains and wilderness. In addition to ensuring the completion of their own production tasks, the army has also decided to draw 1,000 laborers to help the masses with labor for 10 to 15 days.

(Editor's note: The People's Liberation Army Fifth Army was reorganized on December 21, 1949, from the National Army of the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan in the former Xinjiang Province. In order to resist the reactionary rule and massacres and looting of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang initially organized a guerrilla force with only primitive weapons such as knives, spears, and axes. In the fighting with the Kuomintang bandit army, it gradually grew stronger. On April 8, 1945, the guerrillas were reorganized into a regular National Army, led by Akhmetjan Kasimi. Its members included outstanding sons and daughters of the Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, Tatar, Mongolian, Hui, and Han ethnic groups, who were as united as brothers and were closely linked with the people of all ethnic groups, fighting together and overcoming the difficult years of the dark rule of the Kuomintang, successively liberating the people of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan (Chenghua) regions, and winning glorious victories. Finally, on December 8, 1949, they joined forces with the People's Liberation Army and joined its ranks. The fifth anniversary of the army's establishment was on the 8th of this month, and grand celebrations were held in Dihua and Yining.)

　　驻新疆人民解放军第五军进行修渠春耕
    今年生产总目标：垦荒十六万余亩
    【新华社迪化十五日电】驻新疆的人民解放军第五军，正积极兴修水利、进行春耕。该部直属队和驻伊犁的部队以五万个工兴修伊宁到惠远的长四十公里的皇渠及其支线。自三月二十四日开工，九天内修好三十余公里，完成全部工程的百分之八十。该渠全部完成后，可灌田三十二万余亩。与参加水利建设的同时，某团积极展开春耕。在到本月二日止，二十多天内已完成近两万亩水、旱田的春耕播种工作，完成该团任务的百分之六十。该部其他单位也已积极展开春耕工作。全军今年农业生产总目标为垦荒十六万三千六百二十亩，预计收粗、细粮食七千三百六十二吨零九百公斤。
    全军在生产前周密地进行了准备工作。自司令部以下各单位，都以连为单位编成五十到一百一十个人的生产队和生产小组。有修制农具技术的战士则集中起来建立小型铁木工厂，已造出可载重二吨的五百辆大车。另外由有农业生产经验的指战员和水利技师组成测量队，在动工修渠和春耕前，分往伊犁、阿山、塔城三区各地勘察耕地和水利情况。各种籽种准备了八百多吨。自三月二十四日起，农具工厂制造的新大车、各单位的汽车、旧大车，日夜不停地向垦区和皇渠施工地运送粮食、柴炭、器材。垦区和施工地都架设了帐蓬、蒙古包，或建起平房，在荒山漠野间热烈展开生产建设工作。除了保证完成自己的生产任务外，该军并决定抽出一千个人工帮助群众劳动十天到十五天。
    （编者按：人民解放军第五军系于一九四九年十二月廿一日由前新疆省伊犁、塔城、阿山三区民族军改编而成。新疆各族人民为了反抗国民党匪帮的反动统治与屠杀劫掠，开始时组织了一支只有刀、矛、斧等原始武器的游击队，在和国民党匪军作战中，逐渐壮大起来。一九四五年四月八日，游击队改编成正规的民族军，由阿哈买提江领导。它的成员包括了维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、塔塔尔、蒙、回、汉各民族优秀的儿女们，大家团结得像亲弟兄一样，与各族人民紧密地联系在一起，共同战斗着，渡过国民党黑暗统治的艰苦岁月，先后解放了伊犁、塔城、阿山（承化）地区的人民，赢得了光辉的胜利。终于在一九四九年十二月八日与人民解放军胜利会师，并参加了它的行列。本月八日为该军成立五周年纪念日，迪化、伊宁两地曾举行了热烈的庆祝大会。）
