　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 6th: Over the past eight months, governments at all levels in the Southern Anhui region have led disaster victims in draining water for wheat planting and engaging in sideline production, which has led to the stabilization of the extremely serious disaster situation. Last autumn, the Southern Anhui region suffered a flood that inundated over 1.9 million mu of farmland, affecting 750,000 disaster victims. After the disaster formed, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office and the disaster-stricken local governments successively formed production and disaster relief committees to lead the disaster victims in production and disaster relief work. The Southern Anhui Administrative Office allocated 600,000 jin of grain to carry out emergency relief with a focus, and through cooperatives in the disaster-stricken areas along the Yangtze River, it lent out 3 million jin of wheat seeds to lead the disaster victims in draining water and planting 2 million mu of wheat, exceeding the total wheat planting area of the region in the previous year by 14 percent. Subsequently, the counties in the disaster area convened people's representatives conferences from all walks of life, as well as disaster victim representative meetings and farmer representative meetings at the district and township levels, to discuss issues such as repairing embankments, restoring dikes, and production for disaster relief. The Central People's Government and the Southern Anhui Administrative Office allocated 64 million jin of grain to implement work-for-relief, subsidizing disaster victims to repair embankments and restore dikes.

    Currently, 200,000 laborers are working on the dikes for the spring repair projects throughout the region, which can solve the livelihood difficulties of nearly 500,000 disaster victims. The Southern Anhui Administrative Office has successively allocated 3.2 million jin of production loans, and local cooperatives have also organized credit loans and purchases of local products, mobilizing disaster victims to develop sideline production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 70,000 disaster victims in the region have been organized to engage in production activities such as fishing, collecting firewood, charcoal burning, and transportation. The region has also extensively launched a social mutual assistance and mutual relief campaign, putting forward slogans such as "Relatives help relatives," "Neighbors help neighbors," and "Borrowing and repayment." Incomplete statistics from Wuhu City and the Wu-Dang Special District alone show that more than 2.4 million jin of rice have been raised.

    Through the above efforts, the region enabled all 750,000 disaster victims to overcome the severe winter famine. To this end, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office, in addition to calling on cadres everywhere to fully lead disaster victims in carrying out production for self-relief to overcome the spring famine, also allocated and distributed 6.2 million jin of relief grain and preferential relief grain for emergency relief to disaster victims. Various counties also dispatched a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to organize disaster victims to work on the dikes and repair embankments, using work-for-relief to stop the development of the spring famine.

    Currently, the Southern Anhui region is in the spring plowing season, and the dike repair and restoration projects in the disaster area are about to be completed. The disaster victims are about to return home for spring plowing. How to solve the problem of food shortages for farmers during rice transplanting is the most urgent and important issue for the entire region. The Southern Anhui Administrative Office has released 6 million jin of loan grain, and the counties have now combined this agricultural loan with dike repair and disaster relief for distribution.

　　皖南灾情已趋稳定
    沿江灾民排水种麦二百万亩
    【本报讯】据新华社芜湖六日电：皖南区各级人民政府八个月来领导灾民进行排水种麦和副业生产，已使极为严重的灾情趋于稳定。皖南区于去秋发生水灾，淹田一百九十余万亩，灾民七十五万人。当灾情形成后，皖南人民行署及灾区各级人民政府即相继组成生产救灾委员会，领导灾民进行生产救灾工作；皖南行署并拨粮六十万斤，有重点地进行急赈，又在沿江灾区通过合作社贷出麦种三百万斤，领导灾民排水种麦二百万亩，超过前年全区种麦面积百分之十四。接着，灾区各县又召开了各界人民代表会议和区、乡的灾民代表会、农民代表会等，讨论修堤复圩和生产救灾等问题。中央人民政府及皖南行署并拨粮六千四百万斤，实行以工代赈，资助灾民进行修堤复圩。
    现全区春修工程已有二十万民工上堤，所得能解决近五十万灾民的生活困难。皖南行署又先后拨出生产贷粮三百二十万斤，各地合作社亦举办信用贷款和收购土产，发动灾民展开副业生产。据不完整统计，全区已有七万余灾民组织起来，从事捕鱼、打柴、烧炭、运输等生产。全区更广泛展开了社会互助互济运动，提出《亲帮亲》、《邻帮邻》、《有借有还》的口号。仅芜湖市及芜当专区不完全的统计，即募集米二百四十余万斤。
    该区经过上述种种努力，使全区七十五万灾民渡过了严重的冬荒。皖南行署为此除号召各地干部全力领导灾民进行生产自救克服春荒外，并拨发救济粮与优恤粮六百二十万斤急赈灾民，各县并派遣大批干部到灾区组织灾民上堤修圩，以工代赈，使春荒停止发展。
    目前皖南区正值春耕季节，灾区修堤复圩工程又将竣工，灾民即将回家春耕，如何解决农民插秧时的口粮困难，是全区最迫切的一个重要问题。皖南行署乃发放六百万斤贷粮，现各县已将此项农贷结合修堤、救灾发放完毕。
