    What Does the Soviet Ruble Exchange Rate Changing to the Gold Standard Mean?
    Professor Pulotnikov
    Comrade Yershov, a reader of Moscow's Truth newspaper, asks: "What does it mean that the Soviet Ruble exchange rate has been changed to the gold standard?"
    Answer: The Soviet people are greeting with great enthusiasm the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik) on again reducing state retail prices of food and manufactured goods, as well as the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers on changing the Ruble to a gold standard and increasing its exchange rate with foreign currencies.

    These two documents clearly demonstrate the great superiority of the socialist system and the power of our socialist motherland, while also reflecting Stalin's concern for improving the people's happiness.

    The monetary reform implemented in December 1947, and the simultaneous abolition of rationing and reduction of prices, eradicated the adverse consequences of the Second World War on monetary circulation and restored the full value of the Soviet Ruble. As a result of the price reductions, the people gained nearly 86 billion Rubles within a year.

    These measures by the Party and the government provided a powerful impetus to the upsurge of the Soviet economy, the growth of the material well-being of the workers, and the improvement of cultural standards.

    The achievements obtained during the implementation of the post-war Five-Year Plan allowed for a second significant reduction in the prices of food and general consumer goods on March 1, 1949, which gave the people nearly 71 billion Rubles in benefits within a year. The new, third reduction in prices, implemented this time, will give the people 110 billion Rubles in benefits within a year. Such a huge reduction in prices further strengthens the Ruble, creating a powerful impetus for further improving labor productivity and promoting material prosperity.

    These measures by the Soviet government promote the increase of the Ruble's exchange rate with foreign currencies.

    The Soviet Union has extensive economic ties with foreign countries. The basic economic relationship between the Soviet Union and foreign countries is foreign trade, which is exclusively controlled by the state. State monopoly of foreign trade means that the right to purchase foreign goods abroad and the right to sell one's own goods in foreign markets are entirely in the hands of the state.

    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government always follow the instructions of Lenin and Stalin on strengthening the state monopoly of foreign trade. This monopoly is the main lever for defending and consolidating the independence of the Soviet state.

    The monopoly of foreign trade also stipulates the organization of financial relations between the Soviet Union and foreign countries. In the Soviet Union, all international payment activities are controlled by the government. This is the inevitable result of the monopoly of foreign trade. All payment activities with foreign countries, as well as the buying and selling of precious metals and foreign exchange, are monopolized by the Soviet government and executed by the State Bank of the Soviet Union. All payment activities of Soviet import and export organizations must be carried out through the State Bank of the Soviet Union. Some foreign payment activities are carried out by the Bank for Foreign Trade under the supervision of the State Bank.

    All foreign payment activities and the Soviet Union's foreign trade accounts are calculated in foreign currencies. However, the circulation of foreign currencies is prohibited within the Soviet Union.

    All payment activities between the State Bank and Soviet import and export organizations, foreign companies, and foreign citizens are calculated by the State Bank according to the exchange rate stipulated between the Ruble and foreign currencies. The currency exchange rates of capitalist countries are governed by blind laws. In the Soviet Union, however, the Ruble exchange rate—that is, the ratio between the Soviet monetary unit and foreign monetary units—is stipulated by the Market Price Committee of the State Bank and published periodically in newspapers. This price is determined by the purchasing power of the Ruble and foreign currencies per unit or per hundred units.

    The Ruble exchange rate was determined at that time using various foreign currencies as the standard. Therefore, the Soviet government decided to stipulate the following ratio between the Ruble and the Franc from February 29, 1936: one Ruble was worth three Francs. The Ruble price was estimated using the Franc as the standard because France at that time was the only major capitalist country that maintained the stable value of its currency on a fixed gold standard.

    However, this ratio did not last long. After the devaluation of the Franc on November 1, 1936, the price of one Ruble was raised to 4.25 Francs to adapt to the reduced gold parity of the Franc. In 1937, the Franc was devalued again. It abandoned the gold standard and was completely unsuitable as a standard for calculating the Soviet Union's foreign trade with foreign countries.

    On July 19, 1937, the Soviet government passed a decision to use the US dollar as the Ruble exchange rate: 5 Rubles 30 Kopecks per US dollar. But the price of the dollar suffered drastic fluctuations. The Second World War and the further intensification of the general crisis of capitalism led to a state of extreme disorder in the economies and finances of most capitalist countries in the post-war period.

    The monetary reforms implemented in capitalist countries after the war have completely failed. Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and other countries have not achieved the expected results of stabilizing prices. The day after the issuance of new currencies, prices rose again. As a result, currency devaluation has been triggered in some countries. Marshallized countries continue to gasp in the midst of financial crises, currency devaluations, and rising prices. For example, compared to 1937, French prices have risen twenty-fold, Italian prices have risen sixty-fold, and the same is true for other capitalist countries.

    The significant increase in the prices of daily necessities demonstrates the dramatic fall in currency prices, in other words, it proves that the process of inflation is progressing in capitalist countries. In the past year, these processes have caused a sharp drop in the value of the pound sterling. During the post-war period, the British Labor government made the national economy a vassal of the American economy, completely subjected the pound to the dollar, and shifted all the burdens onto the shoulders of the British working masses. The devaluation of the pound sterling implemented domestically in 1949 resulted in a new rise in prices.

    But the dollar's victory was a victory bought at a heavy price. Long before the devaluation of the pound, the dollar's value had been steadily declining.

    In the United States, production is declining month by month, the army of unemployed is increasing, and new economic crises continue to grow.

    The increasingly obvious inflation in the United States is causing a sharp decline in the dollar's exchange rate in international markets. For example, on the free market in Paris, one ounce of gold is worth $67-68, in Lisbon - $66.4, and in Rome - $70. In fact, the dollar's exchange rate in the market was already less than half of the official price in 1948, which stipulated that one ounce of pure gold was worth $35 (one ounce = 31.1 grams). This proves that the dollar, following the pound sterling and other capitalist currencies, is also showing instability.

    The Soviet currency, in contrast to capitalist currencies, is very stable because it is based on the strong Soviet economy, based on the continuously increasing volume of goods in circulation.

    The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers states: "At the same time, devaluation has occurred and continues to occur in Western countries, which has led to the devaluation of the currencies of European countries. As for the United States, on this basis, the continuous rise in consumer goods prices and inflation (regarding which the responsible representatives of the United States government have repeatedly mentioned) have also greatly reduced the purchasing power of the dollar."

    The great achievements of the post-war development of the Soviet socialist economy, as well as the fall in currency prices in capitalist countries, have made the purchasing power of the Soviet Ruble higher than the official exchange rate. In view of this, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to raise the official exchange rate of the Ruble and no longer use the US dollar as the calculation standard for the Ruble exchange rate, as stipulated in July 1937, but to use a more stable gold standard based on the amount of gold contained in the Ruble.

    The Soviet Council of Ministers decided: From March 1, 1950, the exchange rate between the Ruble and foreign currencies will no longer be calculated using the dollar as the standard, but will be changed to a more stable gold standard based on the amount of gold contained in the Ruble. The amount of pure gold contained in the Ruble is stipulated as 0.222168 grams.

    Based on this gold content, the exchange rate between the Ruble and the devalued dollar or pound sterling has been significantly increased from March 1, 1950. The original exchange rate of 5 Rubles 30 Kopecks per dollar has been changed to 4 Rubles per dollar. The original exchange rate of 14 Rubles 84 Kopecks per pound sterling has been cancelled and changed to 11 Rubles 20 Kopecks per pound sterling. The exchange rate of the dollar has fallen by 1 Ruble 30 Kopecks, and the exchange rate of the pound sterling has fallen by 3 Rubles 64 Kopecks. The exchange rates with other foreign currencies have also been changed at the same time.

    The change of the Soviet Ruble to the gold standard and the increase in the Ruble's exchange rate prove the growing economic power of the socialist state, and once again clearly demonstrate the great superiority of the socialist system over the dying capitalist system.

　　真理报答读者问
    苏联卢布兑换率改用金本位是什么意思？
    普洛特尼克夫教授
    莫斯科真理报读者耶尔萧夫同志问：“苏联卢布兑换率改用金本位是什么意思？”
    答：苏联人民以高度的热情，来迎接苏联部长会议和苏联共产党（布）中央委员会关于再次减低食品与制成品国家零售价格的决定，以及苏联部长会议关于卢布改用黄金为本位并提高它与外币的兑换率的决定。
    这两个文件明确地说明社会主义制度的巨大优越性和我们社会主义祖国的威力，同时反映出对增进人民幸福的斯大林式的关怀。
    一九四七年十二月所实行的货币改革，以及与之同时实行的废除配给制和减低物价，根绝了第二次世界大战在货币流通上的不良后果，并恢复了苏联卢布的全部价值。由于减低价格的结果，人民在一年之内获得了近八百六十亿卢布的利益。
    党和政府的这种措施，对于苏联经济的高涨，劳动者的物质幸福的增长和文化水准的提高是有力的推动。
    在执行战后五年计划期间获得的成就，曾允许在一九四九年三月一日完成了第二次显著的减低食品和普遍的消费品价格，它在一年之内曾给与了人民近七百一十亿卢布的利益。这次实行的新的第三次减低物价，在一年内将给与人民一千一百亿卢布的利益。这样巨大的减低价格使卢布更形巩固，创造了进一步提高劳动生产率的有力推动，促进物质幸福的繁荣。
    苏联政府的这种措施，促进提高卢布与外币的兑换率。
    苏联与外国有着广泛的经济联系。苏联与外国的基本经济关系，是由国家所独占的对外贸易。对外贸易的独占就是说：在国外购买外国商品权和在外国市场上出卖自己的商品权，完全掌握在国家之手。
    布尔塞维克党和苏联政府，永远依据着列宁和斯大林关于加强对外贸易独占的指示，这个对外贸易的独占，是保卫和巩固苏维埃国家独立的主要杠杆。
    对外贸易的独占也规定苏联与外国之间的金融关系的组织。在苏联，国际间一切支付行为都掌握在政府之手，这是对外贸易独占必然的结果。一切与外国支付行为以及贵重金属与外汇的买卖都是苏联政府独占的，而由苏联国家银行来执行。一切苏联的出进口的机关的支付行为都要通过苏联国家银行来进行。部分对外支付行为是在国家银行的监督下，由对外贸易银行来进行。
    一切对外的支付行为和苏联在外国对外贸易的账目，是以外币来计算。但在苏联境内是禁止外币流通的。
    国家银行与苏联进出口机关，与外国公司和外国公民的一切支付行为是由国家银行按照卢布与外币所规定的兑换率来计算。资本主义国家的货币兑换率是受盲目法则所支配的。在苏联则不同，卢布兑换率—即苏联货币单位和外国货币单位之间的比例，为国家银行的市价委员会规定，并按期公布在报纸上。这个价格是由卢布与外币的一个单位或一百个单位的购买力来决定的。
    卢布兑换率的规定，那时是采用各种外币为本位。所以，苏联政府决定从一九三六年二月二十九日起，规定下面的卢布与法郎的比率：一卢布值三法郎。以法郎为本位估定卢布价格，是因为法国在那个时候曾是大的资本主义国中唯一固定的金本位上来保持着自己货币的稳定价值的国家。
    但是，这种比例存在没有多久。自一九三六年十一月一日法郎贬值以后，为适应法郎所减低的黄金等价，一卢布价格曾提高到四点二五法郎。在一九三七年，法郎又复贬值。它放弃金本位，而且完全不适合作为苏联与外国的对外贸易计算的本位了。
    一九三七年七月十九日，苏联政府通过了以美元为卢布兑换率的决定：每五卢布三十哥比值一美元。但是美元价格遭受了剧烈的动摇。第二次世界大战和资本主义总危机的进一步尖锐化，在战后期间使大多数资本主义国家的经济和财政陷于非常紊乱的状态。
    战后资本主义国家所实行的货币改革，已完全失败。比利时、荷兰、法国和其他国家，都没有得到预期的稳定物价的结果。在发行新币后的第二天物价就又高涨。其结果，在某些国家里曾引起了货币贬值。马歇尔化国家继续喘息在财政危机和货币贬值和物价高涨的困境中。例如与一九三七年比较法国物价上涨了二十倍，意大利的物价上涨了六十倍，其他资本主义国家亦是如此。
    日用品价格的显著涨价，说明了货币价格的惨跌，换言之，也就是证明了资本主义国家通货膨胀过程在进展着。去年一年中，这些过程使英镑价值剧烈的跌落。战后期间，英国工党政府使国家经济成为美国经济的附庸，使英镑完全屈服于美元，同时把一切重负转嫁到英国劳动群众的肩上。一九四九年在国内所实行的英镑贬值的结果，开始了物价的新上涨。
    但是，美元所获得的胜利是惨重牺牲换得的胜利。在英镑贬值很久以前，美元价值已日益下跌。
    在美国，逐月地发生着生产的下降、失业军的增多，新经济危机继续不断地增长。
    美国愈来愈显著的通货膨胀，使美元在国际市场上的兑换率剧烈下降。例如，在巴黎的自由市场上，每盎斯黄金值六十七——六十八美元，在里斯本——六六点四美元，在罗马——七十美元。实际上，美元在市场上的兑换率早在一九四八年就低于官定价格的一半，官定兑换率曾规定一盎斯纯金值三十五美元（一盎斯＝三一点一公分）。这就证明美元追随英镑和其他资本主义货币之后也表现出不稳定性。
    苏联货币与资本主义货币相反，它是非常稳定的，因为苏联货币基于强有力的苏联经济之上，基于继续不断增多的流通着的大量商品之上。
    苏联部长会议的决定中说：“同时，各西方国家都已发生并且仍在继续发生货币跌价情事，这已招致了欧洲各国货币的贬值。至于美国，在这个基础上消费品不断的涨价和通货膨胀（关于这点，美国政府的负责代表们已屡屡说及），也同样地使美元购买力大为减低”。
    苏联社会主义经济战后发展的巨大成就，同时由于资本主义国家货币价格的跌落，使苏联卢布的购买力高于官定的兑换率。有鉴于此，苏联政府认为有必要提高卢布的官定兑换率，并不再像一九三七年七月所规定的那样以美元作卢布兑换率的计算本位，而是按卢布所含的黄金数量改用更稳定的金本位。
    苏联部长会议决定：从一九五○年三月一日开始，不再以美元为本位来计算卢布与外币的兑换率，而按卢布所含黄金数量，改用更稳定的金本位。规定卢布所含纯金数量为○·二二二一六八公分。
    依据这样的黄金含量，从一九五○年三月一日开始卢布与跌价的美元或英镑兑换率就显著地提高了。原来一美元值五卢布三十哥比，改为一美元值四卢布。原来一英镑值十四卢布八十四哥比的兑换率已取消，改为一英镑值十一卢布二十哥比。美元的兑换率跌落了一卢布三十哥比，英镑的兑换率跌落了三卢布六十四哥比。同时也更改了与其他外币的兑换率。
    苏联卢布改用金本位和卢布兑换率的提高，证明了社会主义国家升长着的经济威力，而且再次明确地证明社会主义制度对于形将灭亡的资本主义制度的伟大优越性。
