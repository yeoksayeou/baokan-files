　　Jing Nineteenth District
    Heavy Losses from Pigs and Sheep Being Eaten; Organize Wolf Hunts to Protect Spring Planting
    [Reported by this newspaper] Within the boundaries of the 19th District of Beijing Municipality, wolves frequently eat pigs and sheep. From the winter of last year to March of this year, statistics show a total loss of sixty-four pigs and seventeen sheep. This affects the sideline production of the masses and hinders the safety of spring planting. The Shijingshan Sub-bureau convened a meeting of village cadres on March 15 to study methods and decided to organize wolf hunts. On March 26, the sub-bureau sent cadres to various villages to organize the masses and deploy work. The police station and the public security team were formed into three groups, and on the 28th, they went to the villages with heavier losses to observe wolf tracks and find wolf dens to prepare for wolf hunts.
