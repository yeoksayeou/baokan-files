Grow More Sweet Potatoes and White Corn
    Gaobeidian Farmers Think of Ways to Increase Production
    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in Gaobeidian Village, District 13, Beijing suburbs, are using methods such as growing more sweet potatoes and white corn to ensure they "increase production by 10%." Farmers in this area generally have the habit of growing sweet potatoes. Ma Ziming, a farmer in Gaobeidian Village, planted 1.6 mu of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes last year and harvested a total of 4,800 jin, which he exchanged for eight shi of corn, making a great profit. This year, he is planting seven mu on his own. According to farmers, the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato is both labor-saving and profitable; one mu of sweet potatoes is equivalent to three mu of corn. The vines from 2.5 mu of sweet potatoes can also feed one pig. Last year, the village planted a total of 38.5 mu of spring sweet potatoes and 81.5 mu of late sweet potatoes. This year, it plans to plant 300 mu of spring sweet potatoes and 700 mu of autumn sweet potatoes, which can increase corn production by 1,843 shi. White corn is suitable for planting in black soil depressions, requiring slightly more fertilizer than yellow corn. The annual yield is two to three shi per mu, which is three dou more per mu than yellow corn. Gaobeidian planted 201.6 mu of white corn last year. This year, the village government is calling on farmers to plant 1,000 mu, which can increase production by 239.95 shi compared to last year. The village has a total of 5,659 mu of dry land. This year, it plans to plant 2,000 mu of sweet potatoes and white corn. For the remaining 3,659 mu, it plans to increase production by one dou per mu (total increase of 365.9 shi) by increasing fertilizer (last year, an average of one cart of manure was applied per mu, this year, an average of more than two carts of manure will be applied per mu), deep plowing and careful cultivation, and preventing pests and diseases. Adding the increased production from sweet potatoes and corn, the total increase will be 2,448.45 shi, greatly exceeding the task of increasing production by 10% (565.6 shi). Currently, the village has planted 270 mu of spring sweet potatoes (autumn sweet potatoes will be planted after the wheat harvest) and 393 mu of white corn, and is continuing to plant.
    Mafangsi, Guanyintang, Huayuanzha, Xidian and other villages in District 13 are also mobilizing farmers to expand the planting of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes and white corn.

　　多种白薯白玉米
    高碑店农民想法增产
    【本报讯】京郊十三区高碑店村农民，正以多种白薯与白玉米的方法，保证作到“增产一成”。这一带农民多有养种白薯的习惯。高碑店村农民马子明，去年种了一亩六分“胜利一百号”白薯，共收获四千八百斤，换了八石玉米，获得大利。今年他独自种了七亩。据农民谈：“胜利一百号”白薯既省工，利又大；一亩白薯可顶三亩玉米。二亩半地的白薯秧还可以养一口猪。去年该村共种春薯三八·五亩，晚薯八一·五亩，今年计划种春薯三○○亩，秋薯七○○亩，可增产玉米一、八四三石。白玉米适于黑土洼地种植，需肥较黄玉米稍多，年产量每亩二至三石，每亩较黄玉米可多收三斗。高碑店去年曾种白玉米二○一·六亩，今年村政府号召农民播种一千亩，可较去年增产二三九·九五石。该村共有旱地五、六五九亩。今年计划播种白薯及白玉米两千亩。其他三、六五九亩，计划依靠增加肥料（去年每亩平均上一车粪，今年平均每亩上两车多）、深耕细作，防止病虫害等条件，争取每亩增产一斗（全部增产三六五·九石）。加上白薯、玉米两项增产量，共能增产二、四四八·四五石，大大超出了增产一成（五六五·六石）的任务。目前该村已种春白薯二七○亩（秋薯在收麦后种），白玉米三九三亩，还在继续播种中。
    十三区马房寺、观音堂、花园闸、西店等村也正动员农民扩大种植“胜利一百号”白薯及白玉米。
