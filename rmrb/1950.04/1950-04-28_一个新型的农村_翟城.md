　　A New Type of Village – Zhaicheng
　　Yan Jun
　　From Dingxian, taking a horse-drawn cart eastward for a morning, you arrive at Zhaicheng. This village, like all villages on the early spring North China Plain, is nestled among the newly greening trees, with a stretch of verdant wheat fields and boundless yellow earth outside the village.
　　The village has more than 580 households. Comrade Kang of the Dingxian Women's Federation introduced to me that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Zhaicheng Village had persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan since 1938. Land reform was implemented in 1948. The feudal system has been completely eliminated. Now, under the leadership of the People's Government, a great production movement is being launched.
　　I came with such excitement to visit this new village, our anti-Japanese base, our old liberated area, that has grown up in struggle.

　Everywhere are Street Poems
　　Upon arriving in the village, the most striking thing is the "street poems." On the yellow earthen walls, on the black gates... they are everywhere on the street. Some of the writing is already blurred, some are new and neatly written in white:

　　Fellow villagers, you must listen　　Selection of seeds don't dismiss
　　If this year's seeds are chosen well　　Next year's harvest will be assured
　　To farm the land, use more manure　　More grain will certainly ensue
　　Farming without manure is applied　　A year is wasted, a futile ride
　　We had experience last year　　If armyworms aren't killed, they'll never disappear
　　Relying on incense and paper to burn　　They'll eat everything, it's a certain concern
　　Families of martyrs and soldiers lack labor　　Organize joint farming to be a neighbor
　　Water helps fish, fish helps water flow　　Cooperation and mutual aid both benefit and grow

　　Also, street poems about saving, autumn grain tax, hygiene, prevention of pests and diseases, production plans... all kinds of content, simple, vivid and lively, are written everywhere.
　　Here, whenever the government issues a new task, new "street poems" are immediately written. When the villagers come back from production to rest at noon, they gather in groups of three or five to look at them. The elderly with poor eyesight and those who can't read find primary school students to read to them, and if they can't hear clearly, they have to explain it to them! Thus, this task is immediately spread throughout the village.
　　"Street poems" have become an indispensable propaganda weapon in this village for promoting every central task.

　Model People's School in the Whole District
　　The People's School in Zhaicheng Village was established last October on the basis of the former literacy classes. Since its establishment, it has always adhered to a tense and disciplined learning system. It has never been interrupted, regardless of wind or rain. Almost all young and middle-aged men and women in the village are students of the People's School.
　　As soon as it is noon break time, the young women, holding their slates and textbooks, call to each other and go to the People's School. Some have just finished grinding flour, and the flour on their bodies and hair has not had time to be swept away. They all abide by the discipline of the People's School, because the discipline of the People's School is what they themselves have established - whoever is late to school is asked to "tell everyone what the reason is?"
　　The People's School is divided into five grades according to the level of education: the first class is advanced, and the fourth class is elementary. They study for two hours every day. Now women study during the day and men study at night, which is determined according to the current production situation.
　　The learning method is flexible. During the wheat harvest or the busy autumn harvest, some people are too busy, or their families are too small to concentrate on learning on time, so they divide into groups according to the area they live in, and assign students from the advanced class to each group as little teachers. In this way, people can easily gather together, taking care of chores at home such as fetching water and feeding livestock, without delaying their studies.
　　The teachers of the People's School are all villagers who do not leave production. They are all "volunteer teachers" who do not take any remuneration. Every teacher is so enthusiastic in serving the masses. Qin Xiaoshun and Liu Sanxi sell pancakes in a small shop. As soon as teacher Li Yingcai goes to the small shop, he teaches them to read. The next day he sees them and asks "Have you remembered it?" If some students do not come to school, the teachers personally go to their homes to find them. The classmates also criticize each other, and the education committee member checks the learning situation every day. If there are any problems, everyone discusses and solves them together.
　　Now, no one in the village thinks that "peasants work and eat, it doesn't matter whether they can read or not." People's School student Mi Yanru said: "Now everyone knows that if you don't study, you won't be able to do farm work in the future; tomorrow when tractors are used to cultivate the land, you won't even be able to recognize the numbers..."
　　The students in the first grade of the People's School can recognize at least 300 characters; the advanced class can generally read newspapers. At the Dingxian Eighth District conference on April 7th to evaluate the People's School in the entire district, Zhaicheng Village gloriously won the award flag of "Model People's School."

　The Village Theater Troupe Loved by the Whole Village
　　As soon as it is dusk, the drums sound! The villagers say: This is the assembly call of the village theater troupe.
　　I chatted with the villagers, and they told me a story about the theater troupe performing:
　　During the New Year, the village performed a play called "Li Ruido." Li Ruido is the village's female production model. The story of this play is about two families: one is a production model, and the other is a lazy couple. What is performed is the real thing about these two families. Although the names are not clearly stated in the play, everyone knows who the lazy couple are. As soon as the play came out, this lazy couple couldn't hold back their faces! The couple both cried! The woman said: "Isn't that who they are playing? Just our family of three, it must be my father who went out and said it? Who doesn't care about their reputation!" The couple complained for a while and cried for a while. Suddenly, they changed. Now, the lazy woman also goes to the fields to work. People asked her, "Are you going to the fields?" She said: "How can I not go to the fields! People are making fun of me..."
　　"Now this family is very active in mutual aid production with others!" Afterwards, the villagers happily told me: "If you have time, go to the theater troupe to see it! They are going to perform a new play."
　　One evening, I visited this village theater troupe loved by the masses. The place where the troupe lives is a not-so-large courtyard. In the office hang the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as the two red award flags that the troupe won for performing in Dingxian last year.
　　Now the troupe is rehearsing new programs. Under the kerosene lamp, in groups, some are playing instruments, some are singing, and some are practicing their lines. The head of the troupe, Shi Hongru (who had just returned home from training at the Baoding Art Training Class), pointed to the female actress who was reciting her lines and told me: "When they first joined the troupe, they didn't know any characters, but now they can all read scripts. Learning to act is learning culture, and when they can act, they can also recognize characters." The troupe is a part of the People's School organization. It is also a study class. The troupe has more than 50 people, and the work is divided into a choreography group, a music group, and a storage group.
　　Their regular task is to cooperate with the central task of the village to perform. For example, during the grain requisition, they would write a play about grain requisition to perform. For example, if the masses in the village did not understand the meaning of credit cooperatives, the troupe would write and perform a play explaining what credit cooperatives are. Sometimes, if the village had a new task in the morning, they would write a play by the evening.
　　In addition, they have also performed a total of fifteen or sixteen plays such as "Heirloom," "Old Nian Buys a Donkey," "The Daughter's Marriage," and "Everyone Likes It." Most of these are new operas, as well as a few Peking operas and Bangzi operas.

　New Life, New Women
　　Under the call of the county and district people's governments, every household in Zhaicheng Village has made a "household plan" for production.
　　In the early spring morning, as soon as the east is reflected in a touch of red glow, the earth becomes lively. The waterwheels watering the wheat are ringing, plowing the fields, weeding the wheat, planting vegetables... women and men alike, driving carts to deliver manure and pull soil. The whips crack with a burst of energy. Old lady Wang Liu, who has white hair, is sixty-seven years old this year, and she also drives a cart to deliver manure to the fields. When she drives her cart through the street, people laugh and shout at her: "You have become a labor force too!" She smiles so wide that her mouth can't close. Young production model Xu Xueqin said: "In the past, when we went to the fields to work, we didn't dare to carry hoes, we hid them behind our backs and walked. As soon as we saw someone coming, we stopped working. We were just afraid of being laughed at." Now, she cultivates thirteen mu of land by herself. Every day when she comes back from the fields, she also spins and weaves. The men in the village praised them, saying: "The women in our village are not feudal! They are in the fields all day long, and they do whatever the men do. Each one of them has a towel wrapped around their heads, and you can't tell they are women from a distance!"
　　In Zhaicheng, women who participated in general field labor last year accounted for 75% of the women in the village; 55% of those who could plow, sow, hoe, and weed and participated in major labor. This year, their new goal is: to learn agricultural production technology and strive for 75% to participate in major labor.
　　Almost every family in the village has joined the "combined group" of free mutual assistance. They raise livestock together and exchange labor with each other. Liu Renli, a farmer who participated in a mutual aid group, said at a mass meeting: "In the past, we worked alone, and we felt like we hadn't done anything all day; now, with mutual aid, we feel like we are talking and laughing while working, and it's over in a while!"
　　Now, under the leadership and driving force of the Party branch, the whole village is carrying out the task of better and more scientifically organizing all the labor force on the basis of the "combined group"; in order to have a more prosperous new life and a better future, a great production movement is being launched.

　　April 10, Zhaicheng

　　一个新型的农村—翟城
    雁军
    从定县坐上大车，一直往东，一个上午就到了翟城。这个村子，和初春的冀中平原上所有农村一样，围绕在刚刚有些绿意的树丛里，村子外面是一片葱绿的麦田和望不到边的黄土地。
    村里有五百八十多户人家。定县妇联会康同志向我介绍：翟城村从一九三八年开始，就在共产党的领导下，坚持抗日战争。一九四八年实行了土地改革。封建制度已经彻底消灭了。现在，正在人民政府的领导下，开展大生产运动。
    我怀着那么兴奋的心情，来访问这个在斗争中成长的新农村，我们的抗日根据地，我们的老解放区。
  到处是街头诗
    一到村子，最惹人注目的就是“街头诗”。黄色的土墙上，黑地的大门上……满街都是。有的字迹已经模糊了，有的是崭新而整齐的白字：
    老乡们  你是听              选种工作别看轻
    今年选的种子好              明年收成有保证
    要种地  多使粪              多打粮食没疑问
    种地要是不上粪              一年等如瞎胡混
    咱们去年有经验              粘虫不打死不完
    指着烧香和烧纸              一定吃个光光秆
    烈军干属缺劳力              组织合伙来耕地
    水帮鱼来鱼帮水              合作互助两有利
    还有，关于节约、秋征、卫生、防止病虫害、订生产计划……种种内容的街头诗，通俗地、生动活泼地到处写着。
    在这里，每当政府布置一个新的任务下来，新的“街头诗”便马上写出来了。村里的人们在生产回来歇晌的时候，三五成群地围着去看。眼力差了，看不清的老年人和不识字的人，就找小学生念给他听，听不清还得给他讲讲！于是，这件工作马上就传遍了全村。
    “街头诗”，在这个村子，已经成为推动每一个中心任务不可缺少的一种宣传武器了。
  全区的模范民校
    翟城村的民校是以过去识字班为基础，从去年十月成立起来的。从成立到现在，始终坚持着紧张而有纪律的学习制度。无论刮风下雨，从来没有间断过。村里的男女青壮年，几乎全部都是民校的学生。
    一到中午歇晌的时候，年青的妇女们，拿着石板和课本，你叫着我，我叫着你，都到民校上学去了。有的刚磨完面，身上和头发上的面粉还没来得及打扫。她们大家都遵守民校的纪律，因为民校的纪律是他们自己订的——谁上学去晚了，就叫他当着大家“说说是啥理由？”
    民校按文化程度分了五个年级：一班高级，四班初级。每天学习两个钟头。现在是妇女们白天学习，男人们晚上学习，这是按现阶段生产情况决定的。
    学习方式是灵活的。在麦收或大秋农忙的时候，有的人因为活忙，或者家里人少不能按时集中学习，就按住的地区划分小组，把高级班的学生分到各组去当小先生。这样，人们很容易聚到一块，一边照顾着家里的挑水、喂牲口等零碎活，又能不耽误学习。
    民校教员都是不脱离生产的本村人。他们都是不取任何代价的“义务教员”。每一个教员又都是那么热心的为群众服务。秦小顺、刘三喜，他们在小铺卖煎饼。教员李英才一到小铺去就教他们认字。第二天见着还要问“记住了没有？”有的学生不来上学，教员们就亲自到家去找。同学们也互相批评，教育委员天天去检查学习情况。有了问题，大伙一块讨论解决。
    现在，村里再没有人认为“庄稼人做活吃饭，认不认字都行”的思想了。民校学生米彦如说：“这会儿谁都知道，不学习将来做庄稼活也不沾；明个实行拖拉机耕地，连个号码都认不下来………”
    民校初级一年级的学生，最少的也能认三百个字；高级班一般都能看报纸了。在四月七日定县八区全区评比民校的大会上，翟城村光荣的得了“模范民校”的奖旗。
  全村爱戴的剧团
    一到黄昏，鼓就响起来了！老乡说：这是村剧团的集合令。
    我和老乡们闲谈起来，他们给我讲一个剧团演戏的故事：
    过年时，村里演了一幕名叫《李瑞多》的戏。李瑞多就是本村的女生产模范。这个戏的故事是表现两家：一家是生产模范，一家是懒婆懒汉。表演的都是这两家的实在事。虽然戏上没有明白地说出名字，可是谁也知道那懒婆、懒汉是谁。戏一演出来，这家懒婆、懒汉脸上可挂不住劲了！两口子都哭了起来！女的说：“那不是演的俺是谁？就俺家三口人，准是俺爹出去说的？谁脸上没有四两肉啊！”俩口子埋怨一阵，哭了一阵。一下子就转变了。这会，懒婆也上地干活了。人们问她：“你上地呀？”她说：“俺不上地行啊！人家光编排俺……”
    “现在这一家子和人家互助生产可积极呢！”随后，老乡们高兴地告诉我：“你有工夫到剧团看看去吧！又要演新戏呀。”
    一天晚上，我去访问了这个为群众爱戴的村剧团。剧团住的地方是一个不太大的院子。办公室里挂着毛主席和朱总司令的像，还有去年剧团在定县演戏得的两面红色奖旗。
    现在剧团正在排演新的节目。在煤油灯下，一组一组的，有的拉，有的唱，有的在练习台词。剧团团长师鸿儒（他刚从保定艺训班受训回家不久）指着正在念台词的女演员告诉我：“她们刚一入剧团都不认识字，这会都能念剧本了。学习演戏就是学习了文化，戏会演了，字也认得了。”剧团是民校组织的一部分。也就是一个学习班。剧团有五十多人，工作分工有编导股、音乐股和保管股。
    他们经常的任务是配合村里的中心任务演出。例如在征粮的时候，他们就编一个关于征粮的戏来演。又如村里群众不了解信用合作社的意义，剧团就编演一个解释信用合作社是什么组织的戏。有时，早上村里有了新任务，晚上就编出戏来了。
    另外，他们还演过《传家宝》、《老粘买驴》、《女儿的亲事》、《大家喜欢》等一共十五六种戏。这些大部分是新歌剧，也是少数的皮黄和梆子。
  新的生活，新的妇女
    翟城村在县、区人民政府的号召下，家家都订了生产的“户计划”。
    初春的早晨，东方刚映上一抹红霞，大地里便热闹起来了。浇麦子的水车当当的响着，犁地的、锄麦的、种菜的……妇女们和男人们一样，赶着大车送粪拉土。鞭梢甩的一股劲儿地响。白了头发的老大娘王刘氏，今年六十七岁了，也一样赶着车往地里送粪。当她赶着车从街上过时，人们都笑着喊她：“你也成劳动力了！”她笑的嘴都合不上。年青的生产模范徐雪芹说：“过去俺们上地做活的时候，锄头都不敢抗着，藏在身后拉着走。一看来了人就不做了。光怕人家笑话。”现在，她一个人种了十三亩地。每天从地里回来，还要纺线织布。村子里的男人们称赞她们说：“俺村妇女可不封建哩！一天长到地里，男人做啥她们做啥。一个一个的头上包个手巾，打远处看都认不出是个女的！”
    翟城妇女在去年参加田间一般劳动的占全村妇女的百分之七十五；能耕、耩、锄、耪会全套活，参加主要劳动的是百分之五十五。今年，她们新的奋斗目标是：学会农业生产技术，争取做到百分之七十五参加主要劳动。
    村里差不多家家都参加了自由互助的“结合组”。伙着养牲口，互相拨工换工。刘任理，一个参加了互助组的农民，在群众会上说：“俺们过去一个人干，干了一天还觉着没干出啥活来；这会一互助，觉得干起活来说说笑笑，一会就干完了！”
    现在，全村在党支部的领导与带动下，正在进行着把所有的劳动力，在“结合组”的基础上，更好地、更科学地组织起来；为了更富裕的新生活和更美好的未来，开展大生产运动。
              四、十，翟城
