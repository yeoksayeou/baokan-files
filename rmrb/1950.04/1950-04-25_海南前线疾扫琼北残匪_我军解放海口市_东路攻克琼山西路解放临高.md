Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 24th: The People's Liberation Army on the Hainan Front has been rapidly sweeping away remnant bandits in various parts of northern Hainan in recent days, and has quickly liberated Haikou City, the political and military center of the remnant bandits on Hainan Island, as well as the two cities of Qiongshan and Lingao, and the town of Meiting in the northeast of Chengmai County. The Eastern Route PLA in northern Hainan, after defeating the 62nd Army of remnant bandits that came to Qiongshan from Bailian City between the 21st and 22nd, took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly towards Qiongshan, capturing Qiongshan County City in one fell swoop on the morning of the 23rd. It then quickly pointed its spears north and liberated Haikou City at 8:00 AM on the same day. The Central Route PLA in northern Hainan, in operations in the Meiting and Huangzhu areas northeast of Chengmai on the 21st and 22nd, annihilated parts of the 755th and 754th Regiments of the 252nd Division of bandits, and then occupied the two places. The Western Route PLA in northern Hainan, which was sweeping towards northwestern Hainan, liberated Lingao County City on the 22nd, pursuing and annihilating a part of the 467th Regiment of bandits fleeing west in the operation, capturing more than 400 bandits.

Introduction to Haikou
　　Haikou City, which was liberated by the People's Liberation Army at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, is located at the northern end of Hainan Island, guarding the throat of the Qiongzhou Strait. It is the political, military, and economic center of the remnant bandits on Hainan Island. The bandit Hainan Administrative Chief's Office, the bandit Hainan Garrison Command, and the bandit Defense Headquarters and other military and political organs are all located here. Before liberation, the remnant bandits built solid city defense works in the urban area. Bandit warships patrolled the sea day and night, and an airport was built in the suburbs, attempting to prevent the powerful People's Liberation Army from crossing the sea and landing to liberate Hainan Island. When the People's Liberation Army secretly crossed the sea from the eastern part of the Leizhou Peninsula at 12:30 AM on March 31st, it took heroic action, directly approaching Haikou City, forcibly landing in front of the enemy, and gave the bandit army a great shock. The remnant bandits then hastily destroyed the airport and fled to Wenchang in northeastern Hainan Island. This powerful blow given by our army's secretly landed troops created favorable conditions for the liberation of Haikou this time. Haikou City has a population of about 600,000, is the distribution center for import and export goods on the island, and its commerce is prosperous. It is the economic center of the island, and has regular ships to and from major commercial ports such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Haiphong. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　海南前线疾扫琼北残匪
    我军解放海口市
    东路攻克琼山西路解放临高
    【新华社海南前线二十四日电】海南前线人民解放军，连日疾扫琼北各地残匪，已迅速解放海南岛残匪政治、军事中心海口市和琼山、临高两城及澄迈县东北的美亭镇。琼北东路解放军于二十一日至二十二日间击溃由白莲市出援琼山的残匪六十二军后，乘胜向琼山急进，于二十三日晨一举攻克琼山县城，并迅即挥戈北指，于同日晨八时解放海口市。琼北的中路解放军于二十一、二十二两日在澄迈东北的美亭、黄竹地区作战中，歼匪二五二师七五五团、七五四团各一部，并即占领该两地。向琼西北扫荡前进的琼北西路解放军则于二十二日解放临高县城，作战中追歼西逃残匪四六七团一部，俘匪四百余名。
  海口介绍
    人民解放军于二十三日晨八时解放的海口市位于海南岛北端，扼琼州海峡咽喉，是海南岛残匪政治、军事、经济中心。匪海南行政长官公署、匪海南卫戍司令部及匪防卫总部等军政机关均设置于此。解放前，残匪在市区筑有坚固城防工事，海面日夜均有匪舰只巡逻，市郊并筑有飞机场，妄图阻止强大的人民解放军渡海登陆解放海南岛。人民解放军于三月三十一日夜十二时半自雷州半岛东部潜渡时，曾以英勇无比的行动，直逼海口市，在敌前强行登陆，给匪军以极大震撼。残匪乃仓皇破坏机场，逃至海南岛东北部的文昌。我军潜渡登陆部队给予匪军的这一有力打击，为此次解放海口创造了有利的条件。海口市人口约六十万，为全岛进出口货物的集散地，商业繁盛，为全岛的经济中心，和香港、广州、海防等大商埠均有定期船只往来。【新华社】
