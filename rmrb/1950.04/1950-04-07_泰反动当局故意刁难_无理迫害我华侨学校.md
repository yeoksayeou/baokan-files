　　Thai Reactionary Authorities Deliberately Make Things Difficult
    Unreasonably Persecute Our Overseas Chinese Schools
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch] According to Bangkok newspapers: Nai Kian Yensajun, Director-General of the Department of Private Schools of the Thai government, revealed the Thai reactionary government's intention to further persecute our overseas Chinese schools in a radio speech he delivered on the evening of March 4th. Nai Kian first declared in his speech that "Thailand has never, at any time, had any aversion to or rejection of foreigners," but he then argued that it is "inappropriate" for overseas Chinese in Thailand to establish schools for their children and teach the Chinese language. Nai Kian also arrogantly threatened that any overseas Chinese school that "acts recklessly" will have its license revoked by the Thai "Ministry of Education," which means closing these schools. Nai Kian admitted that after massively banning overseas Chinese schools in June 1948, the Thai government has successively closed 61 schools run by overseas Chinese in Thailand. According to Nai Kian's claim, these schools were closed not because the Thai government intentionally persecuted overseas Chinese, but because these schools had committed some "errors." The so-called errors listed by Nai Kian include "employing illegal teachers," "insufficient Thai language teaching hours," "teaching students to express loyalty to their country," "spreading political ideologies that endanger Thailand," and "accepting excess students." However, these "charges" listed by Nai Kian precisely expose the Thai government's crimes of persecuting overseas Chinese, which is to persecute teachers in overseas Chinese schools, force overseas Chinese schools to teach Thai, forbid overseas Chinese from being loyal to their motherland, prohibit overseas Chinese from freedom of thought and belief, and deliberately create difficulties for overseas Chinese children seeking education.
    Note: There were approximately seven hundred overseas Chinese schools in Thailand. On May 13, 1948, the Pibul Songgram reactionary government forced overseas Chinese schools to apply for registration in accordance with the so-called "Private School Regulations." At that time, all but 380 of the overseas Chinese schools were banned, forcing 200,000 overseas Chinese children out of school and 3,000 teachers out of work. After this, although the Pibul Songgram government had allowed the registration of some overseas Chinese schools, it also successively closed many of the already registered schools under various pretexts. According to Nai Kian's announcement on the 4th, there are currently only 319 overseas Chinese schools remaining in Thailand.

### 泰反动当局故意刁难  无理迫害我华侨学校

　　泰反动当局故意刁难
    无理迫害我华侨学校
    【新华社六日讯】据曼谷报纸消息：泰国政府民校局局长乃坚·炎沙军在其三月四日晚发表的广播演讲中，透露了泰国反动政府进一步迫害我国华侨学校的企图。乃坚在讲演中首先声明，“泰国从来不曾于任何一个时代有过厌恶及排外的事情”，但他接着却认为我国旅泰华侨设立华侨子弟学校并教授中国国语，“是不妥当的”。乃坚并专横地威胁说：凡是“胡作乱为”的华侨学校，泰国“教部一定要收回其执照”，即是说，封闭这些学校。乃坚承认，泰国政府在一九四八年六月大批封禁华侨学校之后，又已陆续查封了我国旅泰华侨主办的学校六十一所。据乃坚扬言，这些学校之被查封，并不是由于泰国政府对我国华侨的有意迫害，而是由于这些学校犯了什么“错误”。乃坚列举的所谓错误有“收容非法教师执教”、“教授泰文钟点欠缺”、“教导学生向其国家表示忠诚”、“传播危害泰国的政治主义”以及“接收超额学童”等。但乃坚所罗列的这些“罪名”，恰恰暴露了泰国政府迫害我国华侨罪行，这就是迫害我国侨校教员，强迫侨校教授泰文，不许我国华侨忠于祖国，禁止华侨思想信仰自由，并故意刁难求学的侨童。    
    按：泰国原有华侨学校约七百所。一九四八年五月十三日，銮披汶反动政府迫令华侨学校依照所谓“民校条例”申请登记，当时华侨学校除了三百八十所外，其余均被封禁，因而迫使二十万侨童失学，三千教师失业。在此以后，銮披汶政府虽曾允许了若干华侨学校的登记，但同时又以种种借口，陆续封闭了已经登记的学校多所。据乃坚四日宣布，泰国华侨学校现仅存三百十九所。
