Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 28th: The Central South Military and Political Committee issued a decision on April 6th regarding the promotion of comprehensive rent reduction and intensified production for disaster relief work. The decision pointed out:

　　(1) In order to mobilize the broad masses of farmers in the entire region to carry out spring plowing and production and overcome the spring famine, the main task of governments at all levels at present is to universally promote the rent reduction movement. In areas where the rent reduction movement has already been launched, efforts should be made to deepen and universalize the movement, overcoming the phenomenon of rent being reduced in name but not in reality. In areas where the movement has begun to be launched, the movement should be expanded rapidly. In areas where the movement has not yet begun, it should be launched immediately. It is essential that the autumn grain rent of 1949 be reduced in accordance with the "25% rent reduction" regulation in the six provinces of Central South this spring. Those who have not reduced rent should immediately return the rent.

　　(2) When implementing the rent reduction decree, all localities should focus on returning rent. If tenants in some areas have financial difficulties and need to return deposits, a method of returning them in installments should be adopted. In general, only 20% to 50% of the original deposit amount should be returned before the autumn harvest, and it should be returned at the original grain quantity, without interest. Those that have already been returned should not be reversed. Rent refunds should be implemented in accordance with the 25% rent reduction based on the actual rent paid in the autumn of last year, and should not be calculated based on the yield of the year.

　　(3) After farmers legally return rent and deposits, the grain and money obtained from the refunds should, in principle, belong to the original tenants. However, in order to take care of the difficulties of small tenants and poor farmers, local farmers' associations may persuade larger tenants to extract a portion of the grain and money obtained and distribute it to poor farmers to solve the difficulties of production and famine relief.

　　(4) The amount of grain accumulated in the charitable granaries in the southern provinces is quite large. Local people's governments must cooperate with local farmers' associations to clear this accumulated grain and lend it to local poor farmers at low interest. After the summer and autumn harvests, it should be recovered and stored for use as a reserve for the following year's famine relief. Public funds and properties belonging to local ancestral halls and temples should also be cleared. In addition to providing funds for the original schools and public welfare, a portion should be extracted and supplied to local farmers for production and famine relief.

　　(5) In places where rent refunds and appropriate deposit refunds, clearing charitable granary stocks, etc., are sufficient to overcome the spring famine, no more grain borrowing campaigns should be initiated. General private lending should be based on the principle of freedom of lending, with both parties volunteering, interest negotiated, and guaranteed lending and repayment. In areas where the spring famine cannot be overcome after the above measures have been taken, social mutual assistance and mutual assistance between the rich and the poor can be carried out, but it must still be carried out in accordance with the principle of free lending and guaranteed lending and repayment.

　　(6) In the rent reduction movement, policies must be observed and legal struggle methods must be used in order to unite the majority of the masses and overcome the resistance of lawless landlords. It is strictly forbidden to infringe on the interests of middle peasants and industry and commerce, and it is strictly forbidden to beat and kill people indiscriminately. The ringleaders of organized grain robbery riots must be severely suppressed in a timely manner. Evil bullies who stubbornly resist government decrees must be punished according to law. The facts should be investigated and dealt with appropriately for landlords who are truly unable to return rent or deposits, as well as widowed, orphaned, and lonely public servants who rent out small amounts of land, and farmers should be persuaded to reduce, postpone, return in installments, or not return rent or deposits.

　　(7) At present, various places are approaching the season when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available, and the spring famine is becoming increasingly serious. Local people's governments and disaster relief committees must earnestly investigate the disaster situation, register disaster victims, effectively carry out disaster relief work, and earnestly cooperate with government departments to organize disaster victims to help themselves through production, issue agricultural loans, or use work as a form of relief; in severely affected areas, relief grain should be issued immediately, emergency relief should be implemented, and attention should be paid to the treatment of diseases of disaster victims and the rescue of livestock deaths.

### 动员广大农民进行春耕生产渡过春荒  中南区推广全面减租  中南军政委员会发布决定

　　动员广大农民进行春耕生产渡过春荒
    中南区推广全面减租
    中南军政委员会发布决定
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】中南军政委员会于四月六日发布关于推广全面减租和加紧生产救灾工作的决定。该决定指出：
    （一）为动员全区广大农民群众进行春耕生产和渡过春荒，目前各级人民政府的主要任务是普遍推广减租运动。在减租运动业已开展的地区，应力求使运动深入和普遍，克服明减暗不减的现象；开始发动的地区，应使运动迅速扩大；未开始者，应立即发动。务求今春在中南六省将一九四九年的秋季租粮，依照二五减租规定实行减租，未减者立即退租。
    （二）各地在执行减租法令时，应以退租为主，如某些地区佃农生活困难，须实行退押金时，应采取分期退还的办法。在秋收以前，一般只准退回原押金额十分之二至十分之五，并按原粮数折还，不计利息。其业经退还者，不再倒退。退租应按去年秋季实交租额实行二五减租，不应另按年成折算。
    （三）农民依法退租、退押金后，其所退得之粮款，原则上应归原佃户所得，但为照顾小佃户及贫苦农民困难，各地农民协会得说服较大佃户，将所得粮款抽出一部分，分与贫苦农民以解决生产渡荒之困难。
    （四）南方各省义仓积谷为数颇大，各地人民政府必须协同各地农民协会清理此项积谷，按低利贷给当地贫苦农民，一俟夏收秋收之后，再行收回储藏，作为下年备荒之用。对当地祠堂庙宇所属之公款、公产亦得加以清理，除供给原有学校公益用费外，应抽出一部分供给当地农民作为生产渡荒之用。
    （五）凡经过退租及适当的退押金、清理义仓积谷等办法，足以渡过春荒的地方，不应再发起借粮运动。一般民间借贷应依照借贷自由原则，由双方自愿，利息面议，并保证有借有还。经过上述办法尚不能渡过春荒地区，可进行社会互济、贫富互助，但仍须依照自由借贷原则进行，并保证有借有还。
    （六）在减租运动中必须遵守政策，运用合法斗争方式，以便团结多数群众，克服不法地主抵抗。严禁侵犯中农与工商业，严禁乱打乱杀。对组织抢粮暴动的匪首，必须及时予以严厉镇压。对顽抗政府法令的恶霸分子，必须依法制裁。对确实无力退租、退押金的地主及出租少量土地之鳏寡孤独公教人员则应查明实情，酌予调处，说服农民少退、缓退、分期退或不退。
    （七）目前各地接近青黄不接季节，春荒日益严重，各地人民政府与救灾委员会必须切实调查灾情，登记灾民，有效进行救灾工作，切实配合政府各部门组织灾民生产自救，发放农贷，或以工代赈；对重灾区应立即发放救济粮，实行急赈，并注意对灾民疾病治疗与牲畜死亡的抢救工作。
