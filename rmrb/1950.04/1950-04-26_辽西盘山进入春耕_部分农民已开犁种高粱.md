　　Spring Plowing Begins in Panshan, Liaoxi
    Some Farmers Have Started Plowing and Planting Sorghum
    [This Dispatch] Panshan County, Liaoxi Province, is making every effort to promote spring plowing. The entire county has now moved from the preparation stage to spring sowing. Some farmers have already started plowing and planting sorghum. In Gaociatun Village, Shuangtai District, the Zhao Xiqing mutual aid team started working together and planted two *gongqing* of land in one day on the 13th of this month. Nearby villages have also begun plowing successively. In Dongshahe District, three plows were put into the fields on the 14th. Statistics on the 15th showed that 20 *gongqing* of land had been planted in Shuangtai District.

    During the preparation stage, the most difficult problem felt in various districts was the lack of livestock, because most of the livestock had been sold off after last year's floods. The bank issued loans for 1,800 head of livestock throughout the county and absorbed a large amount of floating capital, buying more than 2,000 horses. Dongshahe District alone lacked 600 head of livestock, and with the support of bank loans, 650 head were purchased, thus solving the livestock shortage and guaranteeing spring plowing.

    Because of the disaster in some areas last year, seeds were also generally lacking throughout the county. The county and district governments, on the one hand, called on farmers to help each other and organized them to buy seeds from other places. On the other hand, they provided special hardship households with loans for early-maturing crop seeds: 45,000 kilograms of corn, 115,000 kilograms of potatoes, 85,000 kilograms of wheat, 64,000 kilograms of barley, 75,000 kilograms of sorghum, and 64,500 kilograms of soybeans. Currently, the seed problem has been basically solved. Only the paddy field area lacks some rice seeds, and the wheat field area lacks some bean seeds, which the County Agricultural Loan Association is currently arranging.

    The county has issued 12,500 kilograms of cottonseeds, which, together with the approximately 15,000 kilograms already held by the masses, is enough to plant 100 *gongqing* of cotton. The county originally planned to plant 40 *gongqing* of cotton, but reports from various districts currently indicate that 100 *gongqing* have been reached. Cotton farmers have all conducted germination tests. Roselle seeds have not yet arrived, but the government has issued loans of 50 million *yuan* for seeds in key roselle areas, mobilizing the masses to go to Taian and Haicheng to buy them, for the purpose of planting all the roselle this year.

    Thanks to the promotion of cadres and labor models and the calls of the government, the masses in various districts and villages have organized a large number of labor exchanges and work-sharing groups. For example, the group of Li Lianfa (provincial labor model) in Dawa District has truly achieved fairness, reasonableness, voluntariness, and mutual benefit, and can achieve fixed quotas and quantities, integration of agriculture and sideline occupations, and joint labor by men and women. Cadres and Party members from nearby villages and *cun* have gone to him to learn. He enthusiastically shares his experience with others, and now he has led the way in establishing many new-style mutual aid teams. However, some labor exchange groups have become mere formalities, only organized in name, while in reality, everyone is still doing their own thing. Some are also organized for the sake of loans, and disband after receiving the loans.

    Considerable preparations have been made for farm tools, stubble removal, manure delivery, and so on. On the 15th of this month, 15,000 laborers throughout the county started work on repairing dams in three locations. Various districts have also dispatched cadres to lead on the ground. It is expected that the dam repair task will be completed by May 5th, after which all efforts will be focused on a concentrated push for spring plowing.

　　辽西盘山进入春耕
    部分农民已开犁种高粱
    【本报讯】辽西省盘山县，全力推动春耕。现全县已由准备阶段进入春耕播种。部分农民，已开犁种高粱。双台区高家屯村赵喜清互助组，全组一齐下手，在本月十三日一天即种了两垧地，附近各村也陆续开犁。东沙河区在十四日也有三付犁仗下地。十五日统计双台区已种二十垧地。
    在备耕阶段中，各区感觉最困难的问题，是缺乏牲口。因去年水灾过后，多半把牲口卖掉。银行在全县放出一千八百头牲口的贷款，并大量的吸收游资，共买进牲口两千多匹。仅东沙河区缺牲口六百头，在银行贷款扶持下，就买进六百五十头。这样解决了牲口缺乏，保证了春耕。
    因去年有些地方灾荒，种籽在全县来说，也是普遍缺乏的。县区政府一方面号召农民互助互济，有组织地到外地去买种籽。一方面对特殊困难户贷给早熟作物种籽苞米九万斤、土豆二十三万斤、小麦十七万斤、大麦十二万八千斤、高粱十五万斤、大豆十二万九千斤。目前种籽已基本上解决。只水田区缺一部稻种，麦田区缺一部豆种，县农贷会正筹措中。
    全县发出棉籽二十五万斤，加上群众已有的约三十万斤，够种两千垧棉花之用。该县原计划种植棉花八百垧，目前各区报告已达两千垧。各棉农都做了发芽试验。洋麻籽未到，已由政府在洋麻重点区发放了种籽贷款五千万元，发动群众到台安、海城去买，以作今年全部种植之用。
    各区村群众，由于干部劳动模范们推动及政府的号召，大量的组织起了换工搭犋，如大洼区的李连发（省劳动模范）组，真正作到了公平合理、自愿两利，并能作到定额定量，农副业结合，男女一齐劳动。附近村屯的干部及党员都到他那去学习，他热心地将经验告诉别人，现在带起新式互助组很多。但也有一部分换工组流于形式，只是口头组织起来，实际还是各干各的，也有为贷款而组织起来的，领到了贷款又散伙了。
    农具、刨楂子、送粪等，都有了相当的准备。全县一万五千民工，本月十五日分三处开工修坝。各区也抽出干部到现地领导。预定五月五日完成修坝任务，以后便全力突击春耕。（辽西省盘山县委宣传部）
