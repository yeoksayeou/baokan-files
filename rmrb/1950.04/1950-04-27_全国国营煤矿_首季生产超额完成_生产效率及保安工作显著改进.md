Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to information from the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government: The total production of national state-owned coal mines in the first quarter of this year exceeded the original plan by 5.5%. Among them, the Northeast region exceeded the original plan by 11%, the Central-South region exceeded the original plan by 3%, while North China only completed 99.9% of the set task, Shandong only completed 96%, and Huainan only completed 97%. In the North China region, the state-owned Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, and Lu'an mines have overfulfilled their tasks in the first quarter, but the Jingxing Coal Mine failed to complete the plan due to problems with overhaul; the Yangquan Coal Mine only completed 86% of the plan due to the continued existence of the "ba tou" (foreman) system.

Production efficiency in most coal mines also improved significantly in the first quarter. The Northeast exceeded the planned standard by 3%, an increase of 22% compared to last year; North China exceeded the initial planned standard by 4%, an increase of 28.7% compared to last year. Shandong showed a slight increase compared to last year's level; while Huainan Coal Mine was actually lower than last year. This was mainly due to the conservative adherence to old mining methods and the failure to truly implement democratic management.

Safety work in mines across the country has also improved significantly compared to last year. The mortality rate in the North China region decreased by 80.5% compared to last year, and the injury rate decreased by 27.7%; the mortality rate in the Northeast region also decreased by 9.05%, and the injury rate decreased by 31.7%. The mine safety problem is most serious in the Central-South region. Since the Yiluo Coal Mine explosion, this issue has aroused serious attention from competent authorities at all levels, and efforts are now being made to improve it.

In order to better complete the second quarter's production tasks, further improve production efficiency, and improve safety conditions, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government believes that national state-owned coal mines must promptly solve a number of problems, large or small. Taking the Northeast region as an example, mines such as Hegang and Jixi, which have already reduced working faces and concentrated production, still have scattered pit entrances, the effectiveness of machinery has not been fully utilized, and new mining methods for thick coal seams have yet to be promoted. The most important work in the North China region is to immediately eliminate the disguised "ba tou" system in individual mines, while strengthening the study of advanced technology, standardizing tunnel specifications, and increasing ventilation equipment. Shandong and Huainan mines, with the exception of individual mines, basically still maintain the old set of production methods and management systems, which must be reformed. The Central-South region should learn from the painful lessons of the Yiluo Coal Mine, vigorously strengthen safety work, eliminate the feudal "ba tou" system, and strengthen the unity of new and old cadres to avoid the occurrence of similar incidents.

### 全国国营煤矿  首季生产超额完成  生产效率及保安工作显著改进

　　全国国营煤矿
    首季生产超额完成
    生产效率及保安工作显著改进
    【新华社二十五日讯】据中央人民政府燃料工业部息：全国国营煤矿今年第一季生产总量共超过原订计划百分之五·五。其中东北超过原计划百分之一一，中南区超过原计划百分之三，华北则只完成了规定任务的百分之九九·九，山东只完成了百分之九六，淮南只完成了百分之九七。华北区国营的峰峰、焦作、潞安等矿第一季已超额完成任务，但井陉煤矿因检修发生问题，未能完成计划；阳泉煤矿因把头制仍然存在，仅完成计划百分之八六。
    大部煤矿的生产效率第一季中也有显著提高。计东北超过计划标准百分之三，较去年提高百分之二二；华北超过第一次计划标准百分之四，比去年则提高二八·七。山东与去年水平比较，稍有提高；而淮南煤矿反较去年为低。主要是由于旧的采煤方法保守不变及没有真正实行民主管理的结果。
    全国各矿的保安工作和去年比较也有显著进步。华北区死亡率较去年降低百分之八○·五，负伤率降低百分之二七·七；东北区死亡率亦降低百分之九·○五，负伤率降低百分之三一·七。中南区矿山安全问题最严重。自宜洛煤矿爆炸事件发生后，这一问题已引起各级主管部门的严重注意，现正力求改进中。
    为了更好地完成第二季的生产任务，更加提高生产效率，改进保安情况，中央人民政府燃料工业部认为全国各国营煤矿必须及时解决若干或大或小的问题。以东北区业已减少掌子、集中生产的鹤岗、鸡西等矿而论，坑口仍嫌分散，机械效能仍未充分发挥，厚煤层新采掘法仍待推广。华北区最主要的工作是立即清除个别矿山中的变相把头制，同时加强学习先进技术，统一坑道规格，增加通风设备。山东、淮南各矿，除个别矿场外，基本上仍保持着旧一套的生产方法和管理制度，必须加以改革。中南区则应接受宜洛煤矿惨痛的教训，大力加强保安工作，肃清封建把头制，并加强新老干部的团结，避免类似事件的发生。
