How the Value of the Soviet Ruble Was Increased
    Yang Fangxun

    On February 28, 1950, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to raise the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies: (1) Starting from March 1, 1950, the legal exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies would no longer be calculated based on the US dollar (in July 1937, the Soviet Union determined the US dollar as the calculation standard for the ruble exchange rate). Instead, a more stable gold standard would be used based on the amount of gold contained in the ruble. (2) The amount of gold contained in each ruble was determined to be 0.222168 grams of pure gold, and the exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies was determined based on the gold content of the ruble: one US dollar was worth four rubles (the gold content of the US dollar was 0.88867 grams). The original exchange rate of one US dollar being worth five rubles and thirty kopecks was abolished. After this reform, the external purchasing power of the ruble increased by approximately 30%.

    Why is it that after World War II, the currencies of capitalist countries are depreciating; for example, taking June 1949, prices in the UK rose by 113%, prices in the US rose by 79%, and prices in France rose by 1937% (calculated with 1937 as the base period), while only the currency of the socialist Soviet Union can gradually increase in value? This is mainly due to the following factors:

    (1) Massive Increase in Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Before the Soviet-German War, the Soviet Union carried out three Five-Year Plans; as a result, it transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. The Fourth Five-Year Plan was launched in 1946. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and the selfless work of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, each year's plan was overfulfilled. For example, in 1949, the total industrial output increased by 20% compared to 1948, with automatic loaders increasing by 560%, the most significant increase; steel increased by 25%, leather shoes increased by 22%, and oil increased by 13%. The total industrial output increased by 41% compared to the pre-war year of 1940. The total output of agricultural products in 1949 also exceeded the pre-war 1940 level and almost reached the goal set for 1950 by the post-war Five-Year Plan. In addition, the livestock on state farms also increased, such as cattle increasing by 13%, pigs increasing by 46%, sheep increasing by 12%, and horses increasing by 13%. The massive increase in industrial and agricultural products is the fundamental factor in increasing the value of the ruble.

    (2) State Budget Revenue Exceeds Expenditure
    In 1949, the total revenue of the Soviet state budget was 445.208 billion rubles, and the total expenditure was 415.355 billion rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 7%. This ensured that no additional currency was issued, which greatly helped stabilize and increase the value of the ruble. The budget revenue in 1949 increased by 9% compared to 1948, and expenditure increased by 12.6% compared to 1948. Why did budget revenue increase? This is mainly due to the increasing profits of Soviet socialist industries. The industrial profits of the Soviet Union in 1949 increased by 77.2% compared to 1948. These increased profits were achieved by strengthening cost accounting, increasing the profit rate of enterprises, and accelerating the turnover of products and funds. Taxes collected from the people accounted for only 8.2% of the entire budget.

    (3) Reduction of Production Costs
    Every Soviet enterprise pays great attention to the issue of reducing production costs. Reducing production costs has special significance in the Soviet Union; on the one hand, it is the foundation of socialist accumulation of wealth and the main source of expanded reproduction. On the other hand, workers can purchase inexpensive goods, so it is also an indispensable factor in increasing the value of the ruble.

    Reducing production costs is mainly achieved through the following aspects: 1. Improving labor productivity. 2. Rationally organizing production, reducing the consumption and damage of production raw materials, machinery, fuel, and electricity. 3. Reducing administrative management expenses and the cost of selling goods.

    (4) Accelerating the Turnover of Working Capital in Production
    On January 26, 1949, the staff of 103 enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast collectively wrote to Stalin, proposing to free up 400 million rubles for the state in 1949 by accelerating the turnover of working capital. This suggestion was enthusiastically responded to throughout the Soviet Union, sparking a new patriotic movement. As is well known, in general industry, the storage of raw materials, fuel, parts, and semi-finished products usually accounts for the vast majority of their working capital. If storage is reduced, and each batch of production is shipped out of the factory as quickly as possible and sold for cash, the turnover of working capital can be accelerated. One ruble can be used as several rubles, which can free up a lot of funds to be used in other areas of production. In other words, it can enable the ruble to play a greater role in production.

    The Soviet Union abolished private property, nationalized the means of production, and conducted production according to plans, without overproduction and economic crises. This is fundamentally different from capitalist countries. The amount of currency required for national commodity circulation is fixed. In the case of not issuing additional currency, as long as industrial and agricultural products increase, the value of the currency will inevitably increase. In short, we believe that there are many factors that contribute to the increase in the value of the Soviet ruble, and it is not accidental or simple. It is a concentrated manifestation of the success and victory of socialist economic construction. And the most important links are the massive increase in industrial and agricultural products and the absence of fiscal deficits.

    There was a short period after the October Revolution when the Soviet ruble was also unstable. For example, in 1922, the fiscal deficit reached 50%, with prices rising 80% in January and 112% in February. At that time, the Soviet Union adopted measures to increase tax revenue and other fiscal revenues and save expenses, first balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure without increasing issuance, which stabilized the ruble. Starting in 1929, four Five-Year Plans were successively implemented. As production developed, the value of the ruble gradually increased, and today it has become the most stable currency in the world.

　　苏联卢布价值是怎样提高的？
    杨方勋
    一九五○年二月二十八日苏联部长会议决定提高卢布与外币兑换率（一）从一九五○年三月一日开始，不再以美元为本位来计算卢布与外币的法定兑换率（一九三七年七月苏联确定以美元作卢布兑换率的计算本位）而按卢布所含黄金数量，改用更稳定的黄金本位。（二）确定每一卢布所含黄金数量为○·二二一六八公分纯金，并根据卢布含金量确定卢布与外币兑换率：一美元值四卢布（美元含金量为·八八八六七公分）取消一美元值五卢布三十哥比的原有兑换率。经过这一改革，卢布对外购买力，约提高百分之三十强。
    为什么第二次世界大战后，资本主义国家的货币都在贬值；如以一九四九年六月为例，英国物价上涨百分之一一三，美国物价上涨百分之七九，法国物价上涨百分之一九三七（以一九三七年作基期计算），唯有社会主义的苏联货币能逐渐提高呢？这主要是由下列因素造成的：
    （一）工农业产品大量增加
    苏德战争前，苏联进行过三次五年计划；结果由落后的农业国，变为强大的工业国。一九四六年进行第四个五年计划，由于苏联政府与联共中央英明领导，工人、农民和知识分子忘我地工作的结果，每年计划都超额完成。如一九四九年工业生产总量，较一九四八年增加百分之二○，其中自动装填器增加百分之五六○，是最多的；钢增加百分之二五，皮鞋增加百分之二二，石油增加百分之一三。工业总产量较战前一九四○年增加百分之四一。一九四九年农业产品总产量，也超过战前一九四○年水准，差不多已达到战后五年计划为一九五○年所规定的目标。此外国家农场的牲畜也有增加，如牛增加百分之一三，猪增加百分之四六，羊增加百分之一二，马增加百分之一三；工农产品的大量增加，是提高卢布价值的基本因素。
    （二）国家预算收入超过支出
    一九四九年苏联国家预算岁入总额为四千四百五十二亿零八百万卢布，岁出总额为四千一百五十三亿五千五百万卢布，收入超过支出百分之七，这样就保证了不增发货币，它对卢布价值的稳定与提高有很大帮助。一九四九年的预算收入较一九四八年增加百分之九，支出较一九四八年增加百分之一二·六。为什么预算收入会增加呢？这主要是依靠苏联社会主义工业利润的递增。苏联一九四九年的工业利润，比一九四八年增加百分之七七·二。这些利润的增加，是依靠加强成本核算，提高企业的利润率及加速产品与资金的流转来取得的。整个预算中从人民征得的税收仅占百分之八·二。
    （三）生产品成本降低
    苏维埃的每个企业，都十分注意降低生产品成本问题，在苏联降低生产品成本，有着特殊的意义；一方面它是社会主义积累财富的基础，是扩大再生产的主要泉源，另一方面，劳动人员可以购得廉价的物品，因此也是卢布价值提高不可缺少的因素。
    降低生产品成本，主要从下列几方面着手：１、提高劳动生产率。２、合理的组织生产，减少生产原料，机器，燃料，电力等的消耗与损坏。３、缩减行政管理费用与销售货物的费用。
    （四）加快生产中流动资金周转的速度
    一九四九年一月二十六日，莫斯科及莫斯科省的一百零三个企业的工作人员集体上书斯大林，提出用加快流动资金周转速度的方式，在一九四九年替国家腾出四亿卢布。这一建议在苏联各地得到热烈响应，掀起一种新爱国主义运动，如所周知：在一般工业中，通常是以原料、燃料、零件及半制品的储藏，占去他们流动资金的极大部分。如果减少储藏，把每一批生产品尽快出厂，赶快拿出变卖为现金，便可以使流动资金的周转速度加快，一块钱可以当几块钱用，这样就可以腾出许多资金，用到别的生产方面去。也就是说可以使卢布在生产中，起更大的作用。
    苏联废除私有财产，生产手段国有，生产按照计划进行，没有生产过剩与经济危机，这是与资本主义国家根本不同的。国家商品流通所必需的货币，有一定数量，在不增发货币的情况下，只要工农业品增多，货币价值就必然提高。总之，我们认为苏联卢布价值的提高因素是很多的，不是偶然的，单纯的，这是社会主义经济建设成功与胜利的集中表现。而其中最主要的环节是工农业产品的大量增加与财政没有赤字。
    十月革命后曾有一个短时期，苏联卢布也是不稳定的，如一九二二年财政赤字达百分之五○，一月份物价上涨百分之八○，二月份上涨百分之一一二。当时苏联采取增加税收及其他财政收入与节省开支的办法，首先使财政收支平衡，不增加发行，这样使卢布趋向稳定。从一九二九年开始，陆续进行四个五年计划，由于生产发展，卢布价值便逐渐提高，今天它已成为世界上最稳固的货币了。
