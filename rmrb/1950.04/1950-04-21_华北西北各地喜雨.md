Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Following the spring rains that fell at the end of last month, North China provinces experienced another widespread and thorough rainfall from the 13th to the 17th of this month. These two spring rains are of great benefit to the sowing of grain and cotton, and have eliminated pests in most areas. For example, in the four special districts of Baoding, Tianjin, Dingxian, and Tongxian in Hebei Province, all fire spiders have been eliminated after the rain. In the Cangxian Special District, more than 70 percent of the pests have been eliminated. In Liaocheng, Yanggu and other counties in Pingyuan Province, after the heavy rain on the 13th, 50 to 70 percent of the pests in all wheat fields died. Yan'an, Luochuan, Yanchang and other places in northern Shaanxi also had welcome rain at the same time, and farmers are stepping up spring plowing.

　　华北西北各地喜雨
    【新华社二十日讯】华北各省继上月底降落春雨后，本月十三日至十七日又普降透雨。这两场春雨对粮食和棉花的播种，有极大裨益，大部地区并由此消灭了害虫。如河北省保定、天津、定县、通县等四专区雨后火蜘蛛已全部被消灭，沧县专区害虫消灭了百分之七十以上，平原省聊城、阳谷等县于十三日大雨后，所有麦地害虫死了百分之五十至七十。陕北的延安、洛川、延长等地亦于同时普降喜雨，农民正加紧进行春耕。
