　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch from Tass: The Japanese Geological Society held a joint meeting on April 4th and passed resolutions to defend science for peace and to protest the use of atomic energy for war purposes. Japanese geologists demanded that scientists around the world not use science for war purposes and not engage in any research for war purposes.

　　On April 3rd, a meeting of women's organizations in the Kansai area passed a resolution to collect signatures for a declaration for peace. In addition, it was decided to distribute pamphlets to workers in factories manufacturing war materials, striving to get them to obstruct the production of munitions.

　　On March 9th and 10th, the Peace Association of the Tokyo Industrial Professional School distributed a questionnaire among the students, soliciting their opinions on defending peace and on the attitude towards the Japanese peace treaty. The results of the survey showed that the vast majority of students opposed turning Japan into a military base, opposed a separate peace treaty; favored the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces after the conclusion of the peace treaty, and favored the prohibition of atomic weapons.
