[This article reports on the effort of a department store and cooperatives to improve the rural economy.]

    [News from our newspaper] According to Songjiang Daily news: Acheng County Department Store closely integrated with the urban workers' cooperative (including consumption and production) and the military dependents' cooperative on the 7th of this month, establishing agency sales relationships, realizing the combination of production and sales, the combination of urban and rural areas, and giving play to the leading role of state-owned stores and the linking role of cooperatives.

    In mid-March, the company and the cooperatives, based on a series of problems such as insufficient variety of goods (especially means of production), small cooperative funds, small business scope, farmers having grain but no money, grain companies needing to purchase grain, and the dispersed small handicraft production lacking plans and sales channels, decided through research to organize a part of the urban handicraft industry that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood through the workers' cooperative. The iron plows, pots, hoe blades, hoe hooks, weeding hoes, levers, axes, rope loops, vehicles, etc., manufactured by the artisans as well as the handicraft products made and sold by the military dependents' cooperative, such as vermicelli, hemp rope, and local window paper, are all sold on commission by the department store for only one percent commission. In this way, after the farmers sell their surplus grain to the grain company, the grain company issues checks to be transferred to the department store to exchange for these handicraft products. The cooperative exchanges the various materials of the company according to the price of the handicraft products sold by the department store, then sells the materials and pays the money to the craftsmen. This chain of methods solves the problem of farmers and rural cooperatives not having money to buy living and production materials, and they can directly buy guaranteed quality and inexpensive handicraft products without being subjected to intermediate exploitation and deception. The department store increases its sales and accelerates the completion of its money recovery task by exchanging materials for handicraft products. The increase in goods for cooperatives also accelerates the turnover of funds and greatly improves its prestige. For example, the Yishun plow handcrafter saw the benefits of agency sales and immediately went to the workers' cooperative to request an introduction to the department store for agency sales. The number of members of the cooperative also increased accordingly.

    Through this kind of agency sales, handicrafts and cooperatives have signed production and sales contracts, stipulating quality, and the cooperatives also provide loans to support them. Because the products are centrally sold on commission, there is comparison; therefore, it not only leads its planned production but also stimulates the improvement of quality and the enthusiasm for production. For example, Han's furnace (remote address) had accumulated fifteen picks in the past, which could not be sold. After the agency sales, a rural cooperative immediately bought them all. Now, in just ten days, the department store has sold about 50 million yuan worth of products on commission. This method illustrates that the difficulties in production and sales and the lack of funds can always be overcome as long as we actively think of ways and closely integrate all parties. Especially when national prices are generally stable and the products of public and private enterprises are temporarily experiencing sluggish sales, professional companies and cooperatives in various places should give more play to creativity and create new methods in their business operations in order to complete the monetary recovery plan in a timely manner, and use this to improve public-private relations and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The Songjiang Daily published a short commentary on this, suggesting that all localities learn from the Acheng Department Store's agency sales method.

　　发挥国营商店的领导作用
    松江阿城百货公司与合作社建立代销产品关系
    打开手工业品销路，供应农民必需品
    【本报讯】据松江日报消息：阿城县百货公司，于本月七日与城区职工合作社（该社包括消费、生产）和军属合作社密切结合，建立代销关系，实现了产销结合，城乡结合，发挥了国营商店的领导作用与合作社的纽带作用。
    在三月中，该公司及合作社即根据自己在物资品种上还不够多（尤其是生产资料）、合作社资金小、业务范围不大、农民有粮没款、粮食公司需要购粮、小手工业生产分散没计划没销路等一连串的问题，经过研究决定通过职工合作社、并由该社组织城区内一部分有利国计民生的手工业，把所制的铁铧、锅、锄板、锄钩，薅锄、千斤、斧子、绳套、车辆等，以及军属合作社经营所造的手工业产品，如粉条、麻绳、土产窗户纸等，都通过百货公司只取百分之一手续费给代销。这样农民将余粮卖给粮食公司后，由粮食公司开支票转账到百货公司兑换这些手工业产品；合作社则按照百货公司给推销出去的手工业产品的代价，兑换该公司的各样物资，然后把物资推销出去，再把款付给手工业者。这种连环办法，解决了农民及农村合作社没钱买生活、生产资料问题，并不受中间剥削与欺骗，直接买到质量有保证，价格便宜的手工业产品。百货公司以物资换手工业产品，增加了卖钱额，加速回笼任务的完成。合作社货物增多，也使资金加速流转，威信大大提高，像义顺铧炉手工业者看到代销的好处，马上去找职工合作社，要求介绍到百货公司给代销。该社社员也随着增加了。
    经过这样代销，手工业与合作社订立了产销合同，规定了质量，并且合作社还给贷款扶助，产品由于集中代销有所比较；所以不但领导其有计划生产，且可刺激提高质量和生产的积极性。又如韩家炉（地址偏僻），过去积压了镐十五把，无法卖出，经过代销马上有一个农村合作社全部买去。现仅十天工夫，百货公司代销了约五千万元左右的产品。由这个办法说明了产销上的困难以及缺乏资金的困难，只要积极想办法，各方面密切结合总是可以克服的。特别当全国物价普遍稳定，公私企业产品的暂时呈现滞销的情况下，各地专业公司与合作社为了及时完成货币回笼计划，在经营方式上更应该多多发挥创造性，创造新办法，并借以改进公私关系，促进城乡物资交流。松江日报对此特发表短评，建议各地学习阿城百货公司的代销办法。
