　　To Avoid Train Accidents Causing Injuries
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Public Security Department Offers Several Common Sense Points

　　According to statistics from January and February, there were as many as 41 incidents of deaths and injuries on the railway within the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Railway Bureau alone. The majority of these incidents were caused by passengers and pedestrians lacking general knowledge of train operation. We are now presenting several common situations where danger easily occurs for everyone's reference:

　　(1) Collisions and Crushings Causing Injuries and Deaths: Accidents involving collisions and crushings occur when people are not careful when crossing the railway and rush to cross in front of the train. Some even drive carts and try to beat the train, causing the hooves of oxen and horses to get stuck between the rail and the guard rail, making it impossible to pull them out. Others occur because people walk in the center of the track or along the railway, especially in winter when wearing leather hats with earflaps, and are not careful and are run over by trains coming from behind. Still others occur when people walk on bridges and think the train is far away, without considering the speed of the train, and often walk to the middle of the bridge before the train arrives, resulting in a collision. Recently, there have been several instances of soldiers and villagers using hand signals or shouting to make trains stop in the middle of the track. They do not realize that even if the driver applies the emergency brake upon seeing them, the train will still travel tens of meters before stopping, and applying the emergency brake will injure passengers inside the train. This kind of troublemaking or attempt to board the train mid-journey not only endangers traffic safety but also affects the punctual operation of the train.

　　(2) Jumping Off the Train Causing Injuries and Deaths: Jumping off the train generally occurs because passengers are eager to get off the train quickly and rush to disembark before the train has come to a complete stop. However, trains in motion have great forward momentum and wind force, and if passengers jump off the train without being able to stand firmly, they are likely to be swept under the wheels by the wind. Some are riding the train without a ticket and want to get off outside the station, so they jump off the train before it reaches the station. Others fall asleep on the train, wake up after passing their stop, and then risk jumping off. This is the most dangerous and requires the most attention.

　　(3) Falling Off the Train Causing Injuries and Deaths: Passengers sitting or standing on the footboards of train doors, or urinating at the train doors, are very likely to be thrown off the train when it travels on curved or winding tracks. It is especially dangerous to sit and sleep in the doorway or on the footboard when the train is traveling at night. Others are standing at the train door when their hats are blown off by the wind, and they fall down trying to grab them. Therefore, if the train is crowded and passengers are unwilling to go inside, then later passengers can only stand outside. This not only disrupts order on the train but also does not consider the safety of others, which is very wrong.

　　(4) Catching the Train Causing Injuries and Deaths: Injuries and deaths from catching the train often occur because passengers are unwilling to board the train in advance and rush to catch it when the train starts moving, which is extremely likely to result in being rolled under the wheels. Especially for long-distance passengers, they want to get off the train to take a look at each stop, but the station stops at small stations are very short. If they walk too far, they must rush to catch the train, and a moment of carelessness can cause disaster.

### 避免发生火车伤人事件  天津铁路局公安处提出几点常识

　　避免发生火车伤人事件
    天津铁路局公安处提出几点常识
    据一、二月份统计，仅在天津路局管界内，铁路上发生死伤人命的事件，就有四十一起之多。造成这些事件的原因，大部是因为旅客和行人缺乏一般的火车行车常识。现在我们把容易发生危险的几种情形提出来，供大家参考：
    （一）撞轧伤亡：撞轧伤亡事故的发生，有的是在横过铁道时不加注意，与火车抢道，甚至有赶大车的在与火车抢道时，急于横过铁道乃使牛马蹄子踏进铁轨与护轮轨间，拔不出来。有的是因为在铁道中心或沿铁路行走，尤其在冬季戴着有帽耳的皮帽子，不留心而被从后面开来的火车轧死。还有的是在桥上行走时，以为火车距离还远，不考虑火车行走的速度，常走到桥中央，火车就来了而被撞轧。最近，曾发生过几次军人和老乡在道心以手式或呼喊使火车停驶的事。他们不知道司机在看到他们时就是下非闸也得前冲数十米，才能停住，同时下非闸时，车内旅客便要震伤。这一种无事取闹或想中途上车的行为，不但有碍行车安全，同时更影响火车的按时运转。
    （二）跳车伤亡：跳车伤亡一般是因为旅客急于出站争先下车，故未等火车停住即行跳下。但火车在行动时带有极大前冲力和风力，旅客跳下车而未站稳时，就很可能为风卷入轮下。有的是因为无票乘车的，想在站外下车，故在车未到站前即行跳车。再有是因为在车上睡着了，坐过了站才醒来，便冒险跳下。这是最危险、最应注意的。
    （三）坠车伤亡：旅客有坐或站在脚登板车门处，或在车门处小便，当火车行到义道或弯道时，极容易被甩下车去。尤其是在夜间行车时，坐在车门口或脚登板睡觉更危险。还有的是旅客在车门处站着，帽子被风刮掉，急抓时空闪下去。因此，旅客如因车上人多，就不愿意进到车内，则后来的便只能站在外面。这样，他不但妨碍车上秩序，而且也没照顾到别人的安全，是很不对的。
    （四）抓车伤亡：抓车伤亡多是因为旅客不愿提前上车，当火车开动时才急忙跑来，这是极容易被转入轮下的。尤其是长途的旅客，每到站时就想下车看看，但是小站的站点非常短，如果走得太远了，必要追赶抓车，一不小心便造成灾祸。
