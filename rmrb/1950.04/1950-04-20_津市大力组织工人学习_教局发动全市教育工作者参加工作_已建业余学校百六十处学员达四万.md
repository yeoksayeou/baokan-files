　　Tianjin Vigorously Organizes Workers' Learning
    Education Bureau Mobilizes City's Educators to Participate; 160+ Vocational Schools Established, with 40,000+ Students

    [This Newspaper's Report] Tianjin is vigorously developing worker-peasant education, having organized 40,000 workers to participate in formal vocational cultural studies. At the beginning of this year, with the broad and urgent demand for cultural learning among Tianjin's 340,000 workers, the Tianjin Education Bureau, according to the Central Ministry of Education's 1950 education work plan and the resolutions of the Tianjin Second Representative Conference, planned to open 150 formal worker vocational schools, totaling 1,000 classes, absorbing 50,000 workers and cadres to participate in vocational cultural studies. It was planned to complete the enrollment of 30,000 people before this year's summer vacation. According to this plan, the Education Bureau convened a meeting in early March with principals of primary and secondary schools, directors of cultural centers, heads of cultural and educational sections of each district, heads of cultural and educational departments of various factories and industry unions, and full-time cadres of various vocational schools. The work of vocational schools was arranged. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Education Bureau pointed out that vigorously developing worker-peasant education is one of the key points of the Education Bureau's work this year, calling on the city's educators to undertake this glorious task, and instructing the cultural and educational sections of each district to be the center responsible for promoting and inspecting the establishment of vocational schools. All public and private primary and secondary schools have the responsibility to run vocational schools, and the original principals are the persons in charge of the vocational schools, and leadership of the vocational schools cannot be relaxed under any excuse.

    After the work was launched, the Municipal Education Bureau took the lead, uniting with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Cultural and Educational Department, the CPC Municipal Committee, the Municipal Federation of Students' Committee, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation to form a general enrollment committee, and then established district enrollment committees with the district as the unit (mainly consisting of the cultural and educational section, united with the CPC district committee, public security sub-bureau, various industry unions and their working groups, principals of key primary and secondary schools, and other relevant departments). First, the distribution of workers and office staff in each district was investigated to determine which primary and secondary schools could run vocational schools. Then, the district committee, various industry unions and working groups, and the public security sub-bureau took the lead in conducting mobilization and publicity in various factories and offices. At the same time, the district cultural and educational section and primary and secondary schools were responsible for handling enrollment matters.

    The Worker-Peasant Education Section of the Education Bureau and the Education Section of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also formed a cadre working group to go deep into each district to assist in the work of worker vocational education, and the Education Bureau sent full-time cadres to participate in specific work in the cultural and educational sections of each district, reporting the situation at any time and correcting deviations (such as some schools having a wait-and-see attitude, and some industry unions not conveying this task deeply enough. In District Two, the enrollment time of some schools conflicted with the production time of workers, and very few people were enrolled. After the leaders discovered these situations, they were promptly corrected), and strengthened the work of mobilizing workers to enroll in each district. The Cultural and Educational Department of the Federation of Trade Unions also provided free movie screenings for workers at workers' clubs, and the heads of the Education Bureau and the Federation of Trade Unions personally mobilized them before the screenings, which was very effective. At the same time, radio, slogans, blackboards, and various other publicity methods that could be used were used to mobilize workers to enroll. As of now, with the close cooperation of the Party, government, labor unions, the Youth League, and all sectors, the original plan has been exceeded. Ninety-seven new vocational schools have been established (including 82 mainly run by schools, 10 mainly run by factories, and 5 mainly run by cadres). Together with the previously established schools, there are now a total of 160 vocational schools (including 108 mainly run by cultural centers and schools, 57 mainly run by factories, and 5 mainly run by office staff). The number of students enrolled has reached 41,134 (including 2,345 office staff). Each school has held an opening ceremony.

　　津市大力组织工人学习
    教局发动全市教育工作者参加工作  已建业余学校百六十处学员达四万
    【本报讯】天津市大力开展工农教育，已组织四万名工人参加正规业余文化学习。本年初，天津市教育局在全市三十四万工人普遍迫切要求学习文化的情况下，根据中央教育部一九五○年教育工作计划及津市第二届代表会议的决议，拟开办正规工人业余学校一百五十处，计一千个班，吸收五万工人和干部参加业余文化学习。在本年暑假前，预定完成三万人入学。根据这个计划，教育局在三月初召开了全市中小学校长、文化馆馆长、各区文教股、各工厂及行业工会文教部门负责人以及各业余学校专职干部举行会议。布置了业余学校工作。会上，教育局负责人指出大力开展工农教育，是教育局本年度工作重点之一，号召全市教育工作者担当起这个光荣的任务，并责成各区的文教股为负责推动检查建立业余学校的重心，各公私立中小学都有举办业余学校的责任，而且原校长就是业余学校的负责人，不能以任何借口来放松对业余学校的领导。
    工作开展后，先以市教育局为主，联合市总工会文教部、中共市委、市总学委、青联与妇联，组成总的招生委员会，再以区为单位，成立了区的招生委员会（以文教股为主，联合中共区委会，公安分局，各行业工会及其工作组，各重点的中小学校长及其他有关部门组成），首先调查各区工人及机关工作人员分布情形，决定那些中小学可以办业余学校。然后以区委会、各行业工会及工作组、公安分局为主，深入各工厂、机关作动员宣传。同时，由区文教股及中小学负责办理招生事宜。
    教育局工农教育科与市总工会文教部教育科，又组成干部工作组，深入各区协助工人业余教育工作，并由教育局派专职干部到各区文教股参加具体工作，随时汇报情况，纠正偏向（如部分学校有等待思想，个别行业工会对这一任务传达不够深入。二区有的学校招生时间与工人生产时间冲突，招到的人很少。领导上发现这些情况后，均已及时纠正），并到各区加强动员工人入学工作。总工会文教部并在工人俱乐部免费招待工人看电影，影前由教育局、工会负责人，亲自动员，收效很好。同时，又利用电台、标语、黑板报以及可能运用的多种宣传方式，动员工人入学。截至目前为止，在党、政、工、团以及各界的紧密配合下，已经超过了原定的计划，新成立了业余学校九十七处（其中以学校为主举办的八十二处，以工厂为主的十处，以干部为主的五处），连同以前设立的，已共有业余学校一百六十处（其中以文化馆、学校为主举办的一百零八处，以工厂为主的五十七处，以机关工作人员为主的五处），入学人数达四万一千一百三十四人（其中有机关工作人员二千三百四十五人）。各校已分别举行了开学典礼。
