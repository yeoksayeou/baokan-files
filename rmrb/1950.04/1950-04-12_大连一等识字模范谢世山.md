　　Xie Shishan, Dalian's First-Class Literacy Model
　　By Our Correspondent Lán Cūn
　　In the spring of 1949, the movement to eliminate illiteracy in Dalian was in full swing. In the ice-making plant of the Sino-Soviet joint venture Dalian Fisheries Company, Xie Shishan, a 34-year-old worker, began his first cultural learning experience in his life. When he picked out a piece of scrap iron from the scrap iron pile, hammered it every day, and prepared to make a small blackboard for himself to practice writing, his workmates always laughed at him and said, "Lao Xie, you're so old, what are you still learning culture and technology for? Do you still want to be the factory director?" Lao Xie simply replied, "There will always be a day for success!"
　　Displaying the consciousness of the working class and unparalleled determination and perseverance, in less than a year, Xie Shishan learned 1,400 characters and was able to understand simple reference books on mechanical science. He was able to repair and改造 (gaizao - transform or improve) the ice-making machines, which improved the factory's production.
　　Last October and November, Xie Shishan had three festivals in his life that he will never forget: first, he was promoted to be the director of the ice-making plant; second, he became a glorious Communist Party member; and third, he was selected as Dalian's first-class literacy model. To celebrate his award, his workmates adapted his exemplary deeds in learning into a play. This play is called "There Will Always Be a Day for Success."
　　Like the vast majority of Chinese workers, Xie Shishan had tasted the hunger and hardship of the old society. He had made a living by selling his labor since he was twelve years old. He ran from Guannei (inside the passes - i.e., inland China) to Guanwai (outside the passes - i.e., Manchuria), herding cattle for landlords in the countryside for seven or eight years, but he still couldn't make ends meet. Then, he begged for food in Dalian. He originally wanted to be an "apprentice" and learn a skill. However, in this industrial city under enemy and puppet rule, poor people without culture could not even achieve this wish. As a result, he could only do odd jobs in a chemical factory. Carrying wood, carrying iron blocks, he worked for seven years. In the end, he was still inevitably driven out because he "had no culture or skills." Later, he went to the ice-making plant of the Fisheries Company and still did odd jobs. Working as a handyman in a Japanese factory, he was beaten and bullied, not to mention the low wages. Xie Shishan's family had to rely on his brother picking up scraps to barely maintain their lives.
　　Since entering the factory, Xie Shishan had been determined to work with machines. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would secretly watch how the workmates used the machines. The year the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese in the factory were busy with training and often left the factory. The workmates took the opportunity to sleep and asked Lao Xie to "keep watch" for them. With this opportunity, he groped around in the machine room and asked the workmates for advice, and learned how to operate the machines. But he only knew "square ones against square ones, round ones against round ones"; without culture, he couldn't understand the principles of the machines.
　　In August 1945, the Soviet army liberated Dalian. Soviet friends who came to the ice-making plant shook hands with the workers and said, "We are also workers, we are here to help you build the factory, you must work hard." The workmates had no food, and the Soviet army gave them sorghum rice; their tattered clothes were replaced with new clothes. From then on, the workers stood up and became masters of their own country. Xie Shishan believed the words of the Soviet elder brother and buried himself in work. After working as a handyman for ten years, he only became an ordinary technician in 1947.
　　A year or two passed, and Xie Shishan began to worry: without culture and technology, he couldn't play a big role in production, how could he be a master! The Soviet elder brother often said: "We hope that you will be able to quickly master the factory yourselves, but those of you who have culture don't have technology, and those who can work don't have culture, how is this good?" Xie Shishan felt that this was very dangerous. At the same time, he increasingly felt the inconvenience of not having culture. Once, the machine broke down, and Xie Shishan couldn't write down what was broken, so he had to carry a 150-jin machine to report. The Soviet friends laughed when they saw it, and Lao Xie was so ashamed that he kept wiping his sweat.
　　At the end of 1948, the trade union called on the workers to learn to read and write, and asked everyone to talk about the suffering of not having culture. Xie Shishan felt that this was an unprecedented event, and he was determined to study hard. On March 15, 1949, the factory established a literacy class. The teacher taught very strictly, and each lesson required the students to write on the blackboard. There was a small test every week and a big test every month. Lao Xie was old, and his brain and hands were not very obedient. The characters he learned one day, he would forget the next day, and he couldn't learn them after three or five times. Every time he went to the blackboard to write, he was always anxious and sweaty. He had a struggle in his mind: if he continued to study, one character had so many strokes, and there was the "wood" radical, and the "gold" radical, it was really difficult. If he didn't want to learn, he couldn't forget the past pain. In the old society, wanting to know a character was something you couldn't cry for! It was only with the Communist Party that he had the opportunity to learn. Xie Shishan finally made the final decision. He desperately worked hard. Every time he rested, Lao Xie no longer talked and laughed with his workmates, and his mind was always trying to figure out the characters he had learned. When the Japanese were there, because life was miserable, Lao Xie started drinking; now, he quit drinking, he was afraid that drinking would confuse his brain. He got up early and went to bed late every day; he was reluctant to leave the classroom; when he got home, he practiced writing on the small blackboard, and he wouldn't sleep until he had mastered the characters in the textbook. In order to study, Lao Xie's temper also improved. His wife at home complained that he came back too late and didn't care about the children's illness, quarreled with him, and went to the village government to make suggestions. Lao Xie endured his temper and no longer quarreled with his wife. He patiently reasoned with her, lest he damage the family relationship and distract himself from studying.
　　Xie Shishan almost became a "learning madman." The time outside of production was almost entirely used for studying. When taking the tram, he read the workers' literacy textbook and the staff newspaper; when walking on the road, he looked at the slogans, advertisements, and signs on the roadside. He carried a pencil and a notebook with him, and wherever he went, he wrote down the characters he could remember, and when he came back, he asked people. He didn't dare to believe one person, he only felt relieved when three people said the same thing. Once, he mistakenly recognized the character "luan" (乱 - disorder) on the slogan as the character "hua" (话 - speech), and when others said it wasn't, he ran all the way to the entrance of the telephone bureau to see the character "hua" on the sign clearly before he felt relieved. After such a serious investigation, he could never forget the characters he learned. While recognizing characters, Lao Xie carefully studied and explored some methods. For example, when recognizing the Soviet "Su" (苏) character, he looked at it again and again and saw that the Su character was the grass radical of the "cao" (草 - grass) character, the left side of the "he" (和 - and) character and the "yu" (鱼 - fish) character put together. After such an analysis, the Su character was firmly remembered. He also realized that the characters used on machines mostly have the "jin" (金 - gold) radical, and the characters used on furniture have the "mu" (木 - wood) radical the most. He slowly found some rules of Chinese characters, which were very helpful for understanding the meaning of the characters.
　　Through such diligent study, Xie Shishan obtained the results he deserved. As he said, "As long as the workers have culture, understanding technology is not difficult, it's like window paper, you can poke through it." In less than a year of study, Xie Shishan was already able to use the more than a thousand characters he had learned to study some simple machine principles that he had desperately needed to understand for fourteen years. Last October, he put forward a rationalization proposal to transform the steam dome and valve of the ice-making machine, so that the production volume of the ice-making plant last year increased from 18,000 tons to 24,000 tons. The excess 6,000 tons were all produced after the machine was transformed.
　　Now Xie Shishan knows 2,000 characters. In 1950, he plans to continue learning culture and will step up his study of technology so that he can become an engineer in the future.

　　大连一等识字模范谢世山
    本报记者  蓝村
    一九四九年春天，大连市的扫除文盲运动，热火朝天地开展起来了。在中苏合营的大连渔业公司制冰厂里，三十四岁的工人谢世山开始了有生以来的第一次文化学习。当他在废铁堆里拣出了一块废铁片，天天锤打，准备给自己制一块练字的小黑板的时候，工友们总是笑他说：“老谢，这么大年纪了，还学什么文化和技术。还想当厂长吗？”老谢简单地回答：“总有成功那一天！”
    发挥着工人阶级的自觉性和无比坚强的决心和毅力，不到一年工夫，谢世山学会了一千四百字，能够看懂机械科学的简单参考书。能修理和改造制冰的机器，提高了工厂的生产。
    去年十月和十一月中，谢世山有过他一生中永远忘不了的三个节日：第一个，他被提升当了制冰厂的厂长；第二个，他成了光荣的共产党员；还有，他被评选为大连市的一等识字模范。工友们为了庆祝他的得奖，把他在学习中的模范事迹，编演了一幕话剧。这幕戏，就叫做“总有成功那一天”。
    谢世山，和绝大多数中国工人所经历的一样，饱尝过旧社会里的饥饿和困苦。他从十二岁起就靠出卖劳动力过活。从关内跑到关外，在农村里给地主放牛放了七、八年，生活还是顾不住。接着，他要饭到了大连。本来想当个“学徒”，学点手艺。但是，在这个敌伪统治下的工业城市里。没有文化的穷人，就连这点愿望也达不到。结果只能在一家化学工厂里干杂役活。扛木头，背铁块，一干就是七年。最后，仍免不了因为“没有文化和手艺”而被赶了出来。以后，他又到了渔业公司制冰厂，仍然干着杂役活。在日本人的工厂里当打杂工人，挨打受气不用说；工资更是低微。谢世山一家，还要靠兄弟捡破烂才能勉强维持生活。
    自从进了工厂，谢世山就一心想干机器活。一有机会，他就偷着瞧工友们怎样使机器。太平洋战争爆发的那一年，工厂里的日本人忙着受训，时常离开工厂。工友们就借机会偷着睡觉，并叫老谢替他们“放哨”。有了这个机会，他就在机器房里摸索起来，又向工友们请教，学会了按机器。但只知道“四方的对四方的，圆圆的对圆圆的”；没文化，懂不了机器原理。
    一九四五年八月间，苏联军队解放了大连。来到制冰厂的苏联朋友，和工人们握着手说：“我们也是工人，来帮助你们建设工厂，你们要好好干活。”工友们没吃的，苏军发给高粱米；满身的破烂给换上了新衣服。从此，工人们站起来了，成了自己国家的主人。谢世山相信苏联老大哥的话，埋头干活。整整干了十年杂工的他，一九四七年才当上了普通技术工人。
    一年两年过去，谢世山发起愁来了：没有文化和技术，对生产起不了大作用，这个主人怎样当呀！苏联老大哥常说：“我们希望你们自己能够很快地掌握工厂，但你们有文化的不会技术，会干活的没有文化，这怎么好？”谢世山觉得这样下去很危险。同时，越来越感到没有文化的不方便。有一次，机器出了毛病，谢世山不会把坏的地方写下来，只好扛着个一百五十斤重的机器去报告。苏联朋友看到笑起来了，羞得老谢直擦汗。
    一九四八年末，工会号召工人学识字，叫大家诉说没文化的苦。谢世山觉得这是开天辟地以来没有过的大事情，他下决心要好好学习。一九四九年三月十五日，工厂成立了识字班。教师教得很严格，每次课都要叫学员到黑板上去写字。一星期一小考，一月一大考。老谢年纪大了，脑子和手都不大听使唤。头天学的字，第二天就忘了，三遍、五遍学不会。每次到黑板上去写字，总是急得满头大汗。他思想里起了斗争：学下去吧，一个字一样笔画，又是“木”字旁，又是“金”字旁，实在难。要想不学了，又忘不了过去的痛苦。在旧社会里，想识一个字，是哭也哭不出来的呵！好容易来了共产党，才有了学习的机会。谢世山终于下了最后的决心。他拚命下苦功夫。每天休息的时候，老谢再不和工友们说说笑笑了，脑子里总在捉摸着学过的字。日本人在时，因为生活苦闷，老谢喝上了酒；现在，他戒酒了，他怕喝酒弄糊涂了脑子。他天天早起晚睡；到了课堂就舍不得走；回家就抱着小黑板练字，不把课本上的字练熟不睡觉。为了学习，老谢的脾气也改好了。家里老婆嫌他回去太晚，孩子病了也不管，和他闹，又到村政府去提意见。老谢忍着性子，再不和老婆吵嘴了。他耐心地和她讲道理，惟恐把家庭关系搞坏，分了自己学习的心。
    谢世山快变成了“学习疯子”。生产以外的时间，几乎被他全部用在学习上。坐电车，就看工人识字课本和职工报；走在路上，就看路旁的标语、广告和招牌。身上带着铅笔和笔记本，无论走到那里，都把能记的字记下来，回来就问人。问一个人他还不敢相信，要三个人都说得一样，他才放心。有一次他把标语上的“乱”字错认成了“话”字，别人说不是，他一直跑到电话局门口把牌子上的“话”字看清楚了，才直放心。这样认真地追究，他学下的字再也忘不掉。认字当中，老谢又细心研究，摸索到一些方法。比如认苏联的“苏”字，他看了又看，看出苏字是“草”字的草头，“和”字的左边和“鱼”字拼起来的。经过这样分析，苏字就记牢了。他又体会到，机器上用的字，多是“金”字边，家具上用的字，“木”字边最多。他慢慢地摸到了一些中国字的规律，对于了解字义很有帮助。
    这样钻研苦学，谢世山得到了他应得的成果。正如他所说的，“工人只要有文化，懂得技术并不难，就像窗户纸，一戳就透”。谢世山学习不到一年，他已经能运用自己所学到的一千多字去学习他十四年来所迫切需要了解的一些简单机器原理。去年十月，他提出了合理化建议，改造了制冰机的汽顶和瓦拉，使去年制冰厂的生产量从一万八千吨提高到二万四千吨。超过的六千吨，全是在改造机器以后增产的。
    现在谢世山已认识二千字了。一九五○年，他准备继续学习文化，并要加紧学习技术，使自己将来成为一个工程师。
