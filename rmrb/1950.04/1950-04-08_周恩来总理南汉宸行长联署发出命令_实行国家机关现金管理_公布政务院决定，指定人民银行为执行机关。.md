Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Premier Zhou Enlai of the Government Administration Council and Governor Nan Hanchen of the People's Bank of China jointly issued an order today, promulgating the decision on the implementation of cash management for state organs, which was passed by the 27th session of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The full text is as follows:

I. The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided to implement cash management for state organs in order to regulate cash circulation and conserve cash use in a planned manner, and has designated the People's Bank of China as the implementing agency for cash management, responsible for handling and inspecting relevant cash management matters.

II. All cash and negotiable instruments of all state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives, etc., except for the prescribed limits, must be deposited in the local People's Bank of China or its entrusted institutions in accordance with the deposit methods of the People's Bank of China, and must not be deposited in private banks or firms.

The amount of cash retained by each state-owned enterprise, government agency, military unit, and cooperative shall be determined by the unit concerned providing materials and consulting with the local People's Bank of China, and reported to the local Financial and Economic Committee for approval. In areas where the People's Bank of China has established institutions, the limit shall generally not exceed three days of daily expenses; in areas where banking institutions have not yet been established, the limit shall generally not exceed one month of daily expenses.

Mutual transactions between state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives must use transfer checks and be transferred through the People's Bank of China; inter-port transactions must be remitted through the People's Bank of China. Except for the cash portion that must be used for issuing wages, purchasing from rural areas, and making small miscellaneous expenses in cities, all payments shall be made with checks from the People's Bank of China, and cash payments shall not be made.

The above provisions are designated as one of the important financial disciplines, and must be strictly enforced from the date of promulgation. The People's Bank of China is responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation. If anyone violates the above provisions, the People's Bank of China may report to the financial and economic committee and supervisory organs at the same and higher levels, and impose penalties according to the severity of the circumstances.

III. In order to further implement cash management and ensure that cash flow proceeds according to the planned plan, after the necessary conditions are met, state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives must periodically prepare a cash balance of payments plan, which shall be approved by the local Financial and Economic Committee and submitted to the local People's Bank of China for implementation. When implementing this plan, the People's Bank of China shall combine it with helping enterprises handle liquidation and credit business in order to reduce the amount of cash in circulation. In order to gradually achieve this goal, the People's Bank of China is responsible for drafting specific measures for compiling cash revenue and expenditure plans and assisting enterprises in handling liquidation, and distributing them to People's Banks at all levels and major agencies and state-owned enterprises for research and reference. Trial runs should first be conducted in the major departments directly under the central government to gain experience, and then promulgated and implemented when conditions are ripe.

IV. In order to make the People's Bank of China the center for cash receipts and disbursements, the People's Bank of China must strive to improve its institutions and improve its business procedures, so as to make the handling of receipts, payments, remittances, and other businesses quick and accurate, so that it meets the requirements of serving state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives.

　　周恩来总理南汉宸行长联署发出命令
    实行国家机关现金管理
    公布政务院决定，指定人民银行为执行机关。
    【新华社七日讯】政务院周恩来总理、中国人民银行南汉宸行长，本日联署发出命令，公布中央人民政府政务院第二十七次政务会议通过之关于实行国家机关的现金管理的决定，全文如下：
    一、中央人民政府政务院为有计划地调节现金流通及节约现金使用，特决定对国家机关实施现金管理，并指定中国人民银行为现金管理的执行机关，负责办理及检查有关现金管理事宜。
    二、凡一切公营企业、机关、部队及合作社等所有现金及票据，除准予保留规定之限额外，其余必须按照中国人民银行存款办法存入当地中国人民银行或其委托机构，不得存入私营行庄。
    各公营企业、机关、部队及合作社等，自己保存的现金数目，得由各该单位提供材料，与当地中国人民银行商定，报请当地财政经济委员会核定之。其限额，在设有中国人民银行机构的地方，一般不得超过三天的日常开支，尚未设置银行机构的地方，一般不得超过一个月的日常开支。
    各公营企业、机关、部队及合作社间的相互往来，须使用转账支票，经过中国人民银行转账；埠际之间往来，须经过中国人民银行汇拨。除发放工资、向农村采购及在城市零星开支等必须使用之现金部分外，均应使用中国人民银行支票，不得以现金支付。
    以上各项定为重要的财政纪律之一，自公布之日起，必须严格执行，并责成中国人民银行负责督促检查。如有违犯上述规定者，得由中国人民银行报请同级和上级财政经济委员会及监察机关，按情节轻重，酌予惩处。
    三、为更进一步的施行现金管理，使现金流转能照预定计划进行起见，俟具备必需条件后，各公营企业、机关、部队及合作社，即须按期编制现金平衡的收支计划，经当地财政经济委员会核准后，汇交当地中国人民银行执行。中国人民银行在执行此计划时，要与帮助各企业办理清算和信贷业务相结合，以减少现金流通数量。为逐步达到此目的，责成中国人民银行草拟编制现金收支计划，和帮助各企业办理清算的具体办法，发给各级中国人民银行及主要机关及公营企业研究参考。并首先从中央直属的主要部门试办，取得经验，俟条件成熟，再明令公布推行。
    四、为达到使中国人民银行成为现金出纳的中心，中国人民银行须力求健全机构，改善业务手续，务使办理收款、付款、汇拨等业务时，作到迅速和准确，使之适合于为公营企业、机关、部队及合作社服务的要求。
