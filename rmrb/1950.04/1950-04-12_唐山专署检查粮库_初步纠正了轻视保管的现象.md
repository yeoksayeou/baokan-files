Tangshan Prefecture Inspects Grain Depots
    Preliminary Correction of Neglect of Storage Phenomenon

    [Our Newspaper] To thoroughly inspect the storage work of grain depots in various regions, the Tangshan Prefecture of Hebei Province extracted 21 cadres from directly affiliated agencies on March 22nd, forming five inspection teams to go to counties such as Yutian, Leting, and Luannan to assist the county governments in conducting a serious inspection of all grain depots.

    According to the inspection results, it was found that some counties did a very good job in protecting state property. For example, grain depots in Qianxi, Leting and other counties have formed storage management committees and absorbed troops and public security organs to participate. They stipulated a system of inspection every five or seven days, numbered the grain depots, and responsible cadres inspected on time. In addition, the grain depot conditions and fire-fighting equipment were good, so the stored grain was intact. In addition to issuing circulars of commendation to the above-mentioned counties, the prefectural commissioner's office instructed all counties to establish storage management committees and implement regular inspections.

    However, it was also found that some counties had a serious phenomenon of neglecting the storage of public grain, causing undue losses to state property. Incomplete statistics from only five counties including Yutian, Luanxian, and Fengnan show that more than 520,000 jin of public grain was damp, and severely moldy. Cadres of the Zhangxianzhuang Grain Depot in the Sixth District of Luannan harbored a perfunctory attitude. As a result, the stored grain was not inspected for two months, leading to a collapse of the warehouse due to wind, causing 17,000 jin of public grain to become damp and moldy. Similar dampness and mold also occurred in other village grain depots, and they never reported to the leading authorities, intending to conceal the matter. The Luannan Fourth District Government casually handed over a warehouse in Ciyutuo Village storing more than 300,000 jin of public grain to village cadres for management, resulting in the loss of 1,500 jin of public grain on the night of March 16th. Moreover, the criminals even set a fire when stealing the grain in an attempt to burn down the grain depot, but fortunately it was extinguished immediately and no disaster occurred. However, this incident did not attract the attention of the leaders of the district government, resulting in another loss of 450 jin of public grain at the grain depot in Xijiantuo Village in the district. Some cadres also neglected the storage of relief grain, resulting in frequent damage to rice bran and other items. After this inspection, this irresponsible work style has been initially corrected. The Tangshan Prefecture also summarized the inspection results and notified all counties, emphasizing that cadres who do not cherish state property should be educated and reformed; negligent cadres should be severely punished to ensure that no more losses of public grain occur. It also instructed all counties to further inspect and clean up, improve public grain storage, and establish a clear system of rewards and punishments. (Shan Zhiyou)

　　唐山专署检查粮库
    初步纠正了轻视保管的现象
    【本报讯】河北省唐山专署，为彻底检查各地粮库保管工作，于三月二十二日抽调直属各机关二十一名干部，组成五个检查组，分赴玉田、乐亭、滦南等县协助县政府对所有粮库进行认真检查。
    据检查结果：发现有的县对保护国家财产作的很好，如迁西、乐亭等县粮库，都组成保管委员会，并吸收部队、公安机关参加，规定了五天或七天检查一次的制度，把粮库编号，负责干部按时检查；加以粮库条件及防火等设备良好，所以库粮均完好无损。该专署对上述各县除通报表扬外，并指示各县一律建立保管委员会的组织和实行定期检查。
    但也同时发现有些县份严重存在着忽视公粮保管的现象，使国家财产受到不应有的损失。仅就玉田、滦县、丰南等五个县不完全统计，即有五十二万余斤公粮潮湿，严重者并已霉烂。滦南六区张仙庄粮库干部，思想上存在着敷衍塞责思想，结果存粮两个月未加检查，一致出风倒库，使一万七千斤公粮潮湿发霉。其他村粮库亦有此种潮湿霉烂发生，且从未向领导机关反映，打算隐瞒了事。滦县四区政府把茨榆坨村存有三十余万斤公粮的仓库，随便交由村干部管理，致于三月十六日夜，丢失公粮一千五百斤，且坏人窃粮走时还放火企图烧毁粮库，幸即扑灭未致成灾。但此事发生后也未引起该区政府领导上注意，致在该区西尖坨村粮库又再次丢失公粮四百五十斤。还有些干部轻视赈济粮的保管工作，致米糠等常有损坏的事情。经过这次检查后此种不负责任的作风已初步得到纠正。唐山专署并总结了检查结果通报各县，强调指出：对不爱护国家财产的干部，要进行教育改造；对失职的干部要严格惩处，保证不再发生损失公粮现象。并指示各县更进一步进行检查清理，改进公粮保管，建立严明的奖惩制度。                                          （单志友）
