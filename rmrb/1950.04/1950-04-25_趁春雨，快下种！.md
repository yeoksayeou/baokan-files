　　Seize the Spring Rain and Sow Quickly!
　　To the Editorial Comrade:
　　Farmers often say, "Clear rain at Qingming brings a good harvest; plant melons and beans around Qingming." This thorough rain at Qingming this year is perfectly suited to the needs of the farmers. I hope that the county and district leading organs will immediately organize cadres to go to the countryside to conduct in-depth publicity and education, and eliminate the conservative thinking of the masses who rigidly adhere to the solar terms. Mobilize the masses to exchange good seeds, soak the seeds, and take advantage of the rain to sow. This rain provides a particularly good foundation for planting cotton. From Guyu (Grain Rain) to Lixia (Beginning of Summer), it is the time to sow cotton, and we should make a concentrated effort to sow. County and district leading organs should promote the idea that "one mu of cotton equals three mu of grain," and lead the farmers to plant cotton in large quantities. Leaders in mountainous areas should seize the time to organize mutual aid to repair field terraces, field edges, build embankments, and excavate terraced fields. Advocate planting pumpkins on terraces, planting cowpeas on slopes, and planting more large white corn and yams.

　　趁春雨，快下种！编辑同志：
    农民常说：“雨清明，好年景；清明前后，按瓜种豆。”今年清明这场透雨，正适合农民的要求，希望县区领导机关马上组织干部下乡进行深入宣传教育，消除群众死守节气的保守思想。发动群众换良种浸种趁雨进行播种。这场雨特别给种棉花打下良好基础。谷雨至立夏，正是播种棉花时期，应突击播种。县区领导机关要宣传一亩棉三亩田，领导农民大量种棉。山区领导上更应抓紧时间，组织互助修补地阶、地边、垒埝头、掘梯田。提倡梯田多种南瓜，坡地阶点菜豆，多种大白马牙棒子、种山药蛋。
