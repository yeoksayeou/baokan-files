(News Dispatch from the Beijing Municipal News Office) Pest infestations have been discovered in the suburbs of Beijing. The Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government and the district governments of the suburbs are urgently mobilizing to eradicate them, and are calling on farmers to organize themselves to "eliminate pests wherever they are found!" The pests that have been discovered include wheat leaf sawfly larvae eating wheat leaves in the 13th, 16th, and 19th districts; willow leaf beetles in Taipingqiao and other areas of the 15th district; golden tortoise beetle larvae eating vegetables in the 17th district; and forest tent caterpillars eating crabapple tree leaves in Chengzizhen and other areas of the 20th district. Among these pests, the wheat leaf sawfly larvae found in the 13th and 19th districts are the most numerous, affecting approximately 80 mu of wheat fields in the 13th district and over 300 mu in the 19th district. Under the leadership of the district governments, suburban farmers have actively launched prevention and eradication efforts against these pests. For example, the 15th district has established a command center to organize women and children to capture and kill the pests, and has established reward measures. However, a few farmers still harbor serious superstitious ideas, believing that this is an "act of God," and instead of taking measures to prevent and eradicate the pests, they burn incense and kowtow next to the wheat fields. On the 24th, the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee dispatched cadres to various districts to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation, assist the districts in mobilizing pest eradication efforts and launching publicity campaigns, and collaborate with the North China Agricultural Science Institute to study thorough methods for eradicating the pests.

　　京郊农民捕杀害虫
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊发现虫害。市府郊区工作委员会及郊区各区政府正紧急动员进行扑灭，并号召农民组织起来，做到“在那里发现害虫，就把它消灭在那里”！已经发现的虫害，在十三区、十六区，十九区有麦叶蜂幼虫咬食麦叶，十五区太平桥等地有猿叶虫，十七区有金花虫幼虫咬食蔬菜，二十区城子镇等地有天幕毛虫咬食海棠树叶。其中以十三区与十九区所发现的麦叶蜂幼虫为数最多，十三区受害麦田约有八十余亩，十九区有三百余亩。对这些害虫，郊区农民在区政府领导下已积极展开预防和扑灭工作，如十五区成立了指挥部，组织妇女、儿童进行捕杀，并订出奖励办法。但也有少数农民仍然残留着严重的迷信思想，以为这是“天灾”，不设法预防捕灭反而到麦田旁烧香、叩头。市府郊委会已于二十四日派出干部，分赴各区深入了解情况，协助各区动员灭虫及展开宣传工作，并协同华北农业科学研究所研究彻底扑灭虫害的办法。
