Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Reports from various localities indicate that how to closely integrate spring ploughing with sideline production and river management is a central issue urgently needing to be resolved in the current production and disaster relief work. Experiences in various places have proven that when the actual local conditions are considered, and spring ploughing is taken as the center, manpower, animal power, and materials are specifically organized, labor exchange and mutual assistance are implemented, sideline production and spring repair projects are taken into account, social mutual assistance is launched, and the government specifically helps solve difficulties such as food rations, seeds, and farm tools, then spring ploughing proceeds rapidly and the disaster situation stabilizes. In Ziyang County, Shandong, due to the adoption of such methods, 95% of all spring land has been ploughed, and it has been harrowed four times. Nanbu Township in Huaian County, Northern Jiangsu, organized 17 mutual aid groups for agricultural and sideline production, assigning each disaster victim to ploughing, milling, and other groups based on their physical strength and expertise, with even children participating in picking wild vegetables, gathering grass, and collecting snails. Due to the organized integration of agricultural and sideline production, all 50,000 mu of spring fields in the township have been ploughed once, and 320,000 wheelbarrows of manure have been sent to the fields. In Yingzi Village, Suxian County, Northern Anhui, which suffered severe disaster, the entire village's manpower and animal power were organized, using methods such as organized cooperative ploughing, people pulling ploughs, and people pairing with donkeys to pull ploughs, to solve the difficulties of lacking manpower and animal power. At the same time, sideline production labor exchange was organized to solve the food ration difficulties during spring ploughing; methods such as voluntary assistance from neighbors and relatives and mobilizing those who had fled the famine to return were used to solve the ploughing difficulties of households working on river management projects. Now, the villagers are full of confidence and are working hard on ploughing.

However, some areas, fearing starvation and fearing that the river would flood again this year, are solely engaged in sideline production and river management, or simply providing relief, while neglecting that carrying out spring ploughing and sowing is the basic way to relieve disasters. For example, in Yizhuang District, Fushan County, Shandong, due to the leadership's isolated focus on sideline production, spring ploughing has fallen into a passive, laissez-faire state, with only 5,500 mu ploughed out of the district's 23,900 mu of spring land. In Chengguan District, Leling County, the leadership is only busy mobilizing laborers to manage the river and still does not understand the specific situation of spring ploughing. In Dali Sub-district of Shaanxi Province, some counties and districts have also placed sideline production on par with spring ploughing, or even prioritized sideline production, resulting in laissez-faire spring ploughing. On the other hand, some areas, when mobilizing labor to shift to spring ploughing, have not paid attention to combining it with sideline production, and have simply rushed spring ploughing, resulting in livelihood difficulties for the disaster victims, which has in turn affected the progress of spring ploughing. Some areas only pay attention to spring ploughing and neglect river management, causing the spring repair projects to lag behind. If this is not corrected in time, there is a risk of suffering another flood once the rainy season arrives.

The above two deviations must be quickly corrected, otherwise the farming season will be missed, spring ploughing will be delayed, and the disaster will be expanded and prolonged.

### 救灾必须以春耕为中心  有些灾区只注意副业或单纯突击春耕，两种偏向急须纠正。

　　救灾必须以春耕为中心
    有些灾区只注意副业或单纯突击春耕，两种偏向急须纠正。
    【新华社十日讯】据各地报告，如何使春耕与副业生产、治河工密切结合是目前生产救灾工作中急待解决的中心问题。各地经验证明：凡是根据当地实际情况，以春耕工作为中心，具体组织人力、畜力与物力，实行变工互助，兼顾副业生产和春修工程，发动社会互济，并由政府具体帮助解决口粮、种子、农具等困难，则春耕进行迅速，灾情稳定。山东滋阳县由于采取这样的办法，全部春地已耕完百分之九十五，并普遍耙过四遍。苏北淮安县南堡乡组织了十七个农副业生产互助组，根据每个灾民体力、特长，分配到拉犁、磨粉等小组中，小孩子也参加挑野菜、拾草、摸螺丝。由于农副业结合组织起来，全乡五万余亩春田，都已耕过一遍，并送三十二万小车粪下田。灾情严重的皖北宿县营子村，将全村的人力、畜力组织起来，以组织合犋、人拉犁，人配驴拉犁的办法，解决人畜力缺乏的困难，同时又组织副业生产变工，解决春耕中的口粮困难；再以换工亲邻自愿帮耕及动员逃荒户回来等办法，解决出治河工户的耕种困难。现全村农民正充满信心地紧张耕种。
    但有些地区怕饿死人、怕今年再河水泛滥，单纯进行副业生产和治河，或单纯救济，而忽视了进行春耕春种是解救灾荒的基本办法。如山东凫山县峄庄区由于领导上孤立地搞副业生产，春耕陷于被动自流，全区春地二三九○○亩，仅耕五五○○亩。乐陵县城关区领导上只忙于动员民工治河，至今尚不了解春耕具体情况。陕西省大荔分区亦由于部分县区把副业生产与春耕平列起来，或以副业生产为主，结果春耕自流。另一方面，有些地区动员劳力转向春耕时未注意结合副业生产，单纯突击春耕，结果灾民生活发生困难，反而影响了春耕的进行。有的地区，只注意春耕，忽视治河，使春修工程进展迟缓，如不及时纠正，一俟雨季到来，则有再遭受水灾的危险。
    以上两种偏向，急须迅速纠正，否则会错过农时耽误春耕，并将使灾荒扩大与延长。
