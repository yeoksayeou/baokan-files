In order to create favorable conditions for increasing cotton and grain production, the Handan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative vigorously supported spring plowing, creating the necessary conditions for realizing the cotton and grain production increase plan. The funds of the special cooperative and county cooperatives, except for a portion used for disaster relief and supporting several major side occupations, were mostly concentrated on supporting spring plowing and sowing. In February, the special district cooperative sent cadres to Taiyuan, Tianjin, the Northeast, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Luohe, and other places to purchase fertilizer. In order to help farmers adjust their livestock, cooperative societies in Wu'an, Daming, Wei County, and other counties, districts, and villages also purchased livestock from Luohe in Henan Province, Gui Sui in Suiyuan Province, and other places. From February to early April, a total of 15.5 million catties of coarse grains were transported to various counties, exchanging coarse grains for fine grains during the period between harvests, solving the difficulties of grain shortage for farmers in disaster areas and cotton-producing areas. In order to prepare for spring plowing and sowing, in addition to convening three meetings of county cooperative directors, business section chiefs, and organization and training section chiefs for discussion, the special cooperative also organized three work groups in late February, mid-March, and mid-April to conduct inspection work in Cheng'an, Handan, Ci County, She County, Daming, and Wei County, and issued an urgent notice on April 14, limiting the time to April 19 to quickly transfer the fertilizer and cotton seeds in their possession to farmers through sales, exchanges, and loans. Therefore, most of the funds and cadres were organized into tense work serving the central task, namely spring plowing and sowing.

Timely Supply of Cotton Seeds to Guarantee Increased Cotton Production

Before spring plowing and sowing, the special district and county cooperatives prepared a total of 17,454,710 catties of various fertilizers, which, calculated at 40 catties of fertilizer per mu, could supply 436,367 mu of land; supplied to farmers in various counties. In addition, 2,425,000 catties of cotton seeds were adjusted, solving the cotton seed problem for 485,000 mu of land, accounting for 17 percent of the special district's total cotton planting area of 2,775,000 mu. Most of the above-mentioned prepared fertilizers and cotton seeds have now been transferred to farmers through sales, exchanges, and loans. Secondly, a large amount of grain and coal was adjusted, eliminating farmers' concerns about grain and coal shortages. According to statistics from eleven county cooperatives, 3,594 large carts and 1,246 small carts were organized, adjusting 9,697,200 catties of coal, 6,309,202 catties of grain, and 3,426,144 catties of other cotton, peanuts, etc. In particular, the 15.5 million catties of coarse grains adjusted by the Central People's Government, after the exchange of coarse grains for fine grains, farmers in various counties were very grateful to the government, greatly increasing farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton. Again, a lot of livestock and farm tools were supplied to farmers, improving productivity.

In addition, the cooperative also supported spring plowing and sowing in disaster areas while helping disaster-stricken people through the spring famine. In addition to the coarse-to-fine grain exchange, which played a great role in disaster relief and supported spring plowing and sowing, the county cooperative's organization of disaster victims for production also played a significant role. According to statistics from Daming, Wei County, and Linzhang counties, disaster victims were organized to engage in side occupations such as transportation, crocheting straw braids, weaving straw hats, spinning, ginning cotton, opening flour mills, weaving mats, weaving baskets, blacksmiths and carpenters going to the countryside to repair farm tools, disaster victims collecting manure, and collecting firewood. In three months, they earned a total profit of 1,756,415 catties of rice, which, at half a catty of rice per person per day, is enough to support the lives of 39,031 people for three months.

In the early stage of the cooperative's support for spring plowing and sowing, some cooperatives believed that spring plowing and sowing had nothing to do with the work of the cooperative, and the two could not be combined. Some cadres even used excuses such as "difficult to do," "cannot be sold," and "losing money" to resist. This contradiction has now been resolved. In addition, some county cooperatives used a lot of funds on machine-made fabrics (such as She County), and some cooperatives sold very beautiful men's socks, women's socks, and towels, etc. Because the masses were not interested, few people bought them, and as a result, not much has been sold from last year until now, causing the funds to be tied up and unable to be well combined with spring plowing!

Another approach is that the preparatory work for supporting spring plowing was done well, so the effect was very good. For example, the credit cooperatives in Linqing Town, Handan Town, and Xiaozhai Village in Jize County paid attention to organizing floating capital. In the past three months, they have organized a total of 104,617,000 yuan to support members and non-members in purchasing livestock and fertilizer. For another example, Wu'an County organized 68 old cooperatives to purchase 869 heads of livestock for the masses during the spring plowing period. Linqing Town tried to run a livestock station to contract land work. There are now six heads of livestock, cultivating 159 mu of land, and the plan for April is to sow 2,000 mu for the masses, solving the difficulties of farmers without livestock, and also avoiding the waste of those who have livestock but have nothing to do. Yongnian, Linqing, and other six counties also organized 30 blacksmith classes and one carpenter class with another 42 people to repair and manufacture various farm tools for the masses. Linqing and Handan towns organized 44 supply and marketing teams (a total of 184 people), Linzhang organized a mobile cooperative team, Quzhou and Jize formed peddler teams, and Wu'an organized supply and marketing teams to go to the countryside. These have all played a considerable role in helping the masses with production.

Work is Still Not Deep and Proactive Enough; Profit-Seeking Mindset Needs to be Overcome

However, there are still some problems in supporting spring plowing and sowing. First of all, there is a lack of a sense of responsibility and the work is not deep enough. After the special cooperative arranged the work, the inspection and key pilot projects were not done enough, and there was a lack of guidance. In general, the county cooperative's guidance in combining with spring plowing was also poorly implemented. The results of the inspection in late March showed that many counties did not do it at all. In addition, some county cooperatives originally said that the masses needed a lot of fertilizer, but when they couldn't sell it, they felt that the masses didn't need it. When the work went deep into the masses, they found that it was not enough. This shows that many cooperatives are still staying in the counter to do business. Secondly, some counties still have a profit-seeking mindset, which hinders the work. For example, in some counties, after buying things from the special cooperative, they do not complete the procedures for a long time. Also, the Quzhou County Cooperative sold fertilizer at a higher price than the market price, which affected sales. Some cooperatives also have a condescending mindset, which affected the development of the work. For example, the Handan Town Cooperative monopolized the manure in the town, lowered the price, and prepared to supply it to the cooperative members in the town for planting. The town cooperative had no money to purchase it, and the manure collectors could not sell it casually, which resulted in a blow to the manure collectors. The Jicheng branch of Wu'an sold 27 heads of livestock to the masses, but only collected money for three heads, so more than 20,000 catties of rice funds were tied up and could no longer support production. Handan County supported two oil mills with 20,000 catties of cottonseed last year, and has not recovered anything until now. These shortcomings should be paid attention to and improved in the future.

　　为增产棉粮创造有利条件
    邯郸专区供销社扶助春耕
    及时解决农民肥料、种籽、农具等困难
    【本报讯】邯郸专区供销合作社大力扶助春耕播种，创造了实现棉、粮增产计划的必要条件。该专社和各县社的资金，除一部分用于救灾和支持几种主要副业外，大部集中使用于扶助春耕播种上。二月份该专区社曾派干部到太原、天津、东北、郑州、开封、徐州、漯河等地采购肥料。为了给农民调剂牲口，武安、大名、魏县等县、区、村合作社并向河南省漯河、绥远省归绥等地购买牲口。二月至四月上旬先后运输粗粮一千五百五十万斤到各县，在青黄不接的时期以粗换细，解决了灾区和产棉区农民缺粮的困难。为了作好春耕播种的准备工作，专社除召集县社主任、业务股长、组训股长等三次会议讨论外，还在二月下旬、三月中旬、四月中旬组织了三次工作组前往成安、邯郸、磁县、涉县、大名、魏县进行检查工作，且在四月十四日发出紧急通知，限四月十九日前，迅速将掌握的肥料和棉种采取卖、换、贷的办法迅速转送到农民手中。因此，大部资金和干部都组织在为中心工作即春耕播种服务的紧张工作中。
  及时供给棉种  保证增产棉花
    在春耕播种前专区和县社共准备了各种肥料一七、四五四、七一○斤，以每亩上肥四十斤计，可供四三六、三六七亩地使用；供给了各县农民。另又调剂了棉种二百四十二万五千斤，解决了四十八万五千亩地的棉种，占专区全部种棉面积二百七十七万五千亩的百分之十七。以上准备的肥料和棉种现已大部采取卖、换、贷三种办法转到农民的手中。其次还大量调剂了粮、煤，解除了农民怕闹粮、煤恐慌的顾虑。根据十一个县社统计，组织大车三、五九四辆，小车一、二四六辆，调剂煤炭九、六九七、二○○斤，粮食六、三○九、二○二斤，其他棉花、花生等三、四二六、一四四斤。特别是中央人民政府调剂的一千五百五十万斤的粗粮，进行了以粗换细后，各县的农民都非常感激政府，大大提高了农民植棉情绪。再次，供给了农民很多的牲口和农具，提高了生产力。
    又该专社在灾区扶助灾胞渡过春荒中，同时也支持了灾区的春耕播种。除以粗换细的粮食在灾区起了很大的救灾作用与支持了春耕播种外，县社组织灾民生产也起了很大的作用。据大名、魏县、临漳三县组织灾民运输、掏草帽辫、编草帽、纺织、轧花、开粉房、编席、编筐，铁木匠下乡修理农具、灾民拾粪、打柴等副业生产，三个月中共获利一、七五六、四一五斤米，每人每天按半斤米计，足供三九、○三一人的三个月生活。
    在该社扶植春耕播种初期，有个别合作社认为春耕播种与合作社工作没关系，二者结合不上，甚至有些干部借口“不好作”、“推销不下去”、“赔钱”来作抵抗。这种矛盾现在已经统一。另外有的县社把很多资金使用在机器制成的布匹上（如涉县），有的社代售很漂亮的男袜、女袜、毛巾等，因群众不感兴趣，买的人很少，结果从去年卖到现在没卖出多少，使资金积压起来，不能很好的结合春耕！
    另一种作法是扶植春耕的准备工作做得好，故效果很好。如临清镇邯郸镇鸡泽县小寨村的信用社注意了组织游资，近三月来共组织一○四、六一七、○○○元，支持社员和非社员购买牲口肥料。再如武安县组织了六十八个旧合作社在春耕期间给群众购回牲口八六九头。临清镇试办牲畜站包揽地活，现有牲口六头，耕地一五九亩，四月份计划给群众播种二千亩，解决无牲口农民的困难，同时也免去了有牲口无事干的浪费。永年、临清等六县更组织了铁匠三○班，木匠一班另四十二人，给群众修理和制造各种农具，临清、邯郸两镇组织了四十四班供销小组（共一八四人），临漳组织流动社一组，曲周、鸡泽组成货郎担子，武安组织供销小组下乡。这些在扶助群众生产上都起了相当的作用。
  工作还欠深入主动  营利观点有待克服
    但在扶助春耕播种中也还存在着若干问题。首先是责任心差，工作不深入。专社布置工作后检查和重点试办作的也不够，缺乏指导力量。结合春耕，县社的指导一般执行的也很差，三月下旬检查的结果有很多县根本没有作。另外有的县社，原来说群众需要肥料很多，卖不动了就觉得群众不需要了。等到工作深入到群众中时，却又发现不够了。这说明不少的合作社还停留在柜台里作买卖。其次，有的县还存在着营利观点，妨碍了工作，如有的县份，到专社买了东西，很长时期也不办清手续。又如曲周县社出售肥料比市价高影响了推销；也有些合作社存在恩赐观点影响了工作开展，如邯郸镇社，统治了镇内的大粪，压低了价格，准备供给本镇社员种地用，镇社无钱收购，粪夫又不能随便出售，结果打击了粪夫。武安继城分社卖给群众二十七头牲口，只收了三头的钱，因而二万多斤米的资金压住不能再支持生产。邯郸县去年支持二个油坊二万斤棉籽，到现在什么都未收回。这些缺点都是今后极应注意克服和改进的。（河北省邯郸专区供销合作社）
