　　Tianjin Steel Plant Foundry Shop Breaks Through Old Quotas with Party Work
    Liu Zhizhong, Guo Yunjiang
    The monthly production performance of the Tianjin Steel Plant's foundry shop always lagged behind other shops. Workers' enthusiasm for production couldn't be boosted, and they were relatively lax in their work. The fundamental reason was the existence of small feudal and conservative cliques among a few workers. They rigidly adhered to old rules in production, unwilling to break through old quotas, hindering the overall improvement of the shop's production. Individual master craftsmen worked with their apprentices (laborers) and had very good personal relationships, forming small cliques. As long as the leader (group leader) said something, everyone in the group listened. If the leader said to work, everyone worked; if the leader said to rest, everyone rested. However, there was mutual observation between groups, and no one was willing to take the step to increase production. As a result, the production of the foundry shop remained at its original level and could not be improved. When the foreman wanted to transfer people between groups, he would be opposed by backward workers. Either this group wouldn't let anyone be transferred out, or that group wouldn't want anyone. The group making steel ingot molds was the most severely affected by cliques. This group had a total of six people. The group leader, Liu Yiheng, had a strong conservative mindset regarding old quotas in production. Since liberation, it had been three people producing two sets of steel ingot molds per day, six people making four sets. The foreman, Xu Fenglin, proposed to Liu Yiheng to increase production, but Liu replied, "This is the old rule, it has always been produced this way, how can we increase it?!" When the foreman wanted to transfer people from other groups to his, he would not allow it, saying: The workers are unwilling, afraid of not completing the production task. When work was busy and he was given more people, he would refuse, using the excuse that new hands couldn't do the work and would affect production. When melting iron, because they couldn't increase the output of steel ingot molds, the group making odd jobs also watched them; the group making steel ingot mold cores also couldn't increase output (because they were limited by the molds); the workers at the iron melting furnace also couldn't raise their production enthusiasm, often opening the furnace once every six days, only melting eighteen tons of iron. The shop director and foreman saw this situation and always wanted to find ways to improve it, but they didn't dare to boldly take responsibility for adjusting the labor organization, fearing opposition from backward workers, so they failed to find ways to improve it in time.
    However, in the year since liberation, the general workers have developed a preliminary class consciousness, especially after the model evaluation movement in February this year, which inspired the workers' desire to strive to be models. Some workers secretly worked harder. In late February, the old technician Sun Wenqian modified the refractory bricks under the copper melting pot, increasing copper production. In order to strive to be labor models, the workers also demanded to increase the overall production of the shop. At this time, everyone reflected on why the steel ingot mold group always made only two sets? But no one was willing to directly request to replace this group, fearing ridicule from backward workers. At the same time, they were also unwilling to increase their own production volume, fearing that the backward would say they were showing off.
    The Communist Party branch secretary, Cui Wannian, and Qi Shaoyi went deep into the site, listened to these reflections from the workers, and analyzed and studied the situation in the shop. They discovered that the fundamental reason why production couldn't be increased was due to a portion of backward workers engaging in small cliques. In order to increase production without affecting the mood of the workers making steel ingot molds, they personally talked to Liu Yiheng to mobilize him to voluntarily increase production in order to drive the entire shop. However, after several talks, it was still ineffective. At this time, the branch prepared to disperse the small cliques and adjust the labor organization. First, they mobilized and inspired Party members, League members, and activists to take the lead in uniting the masses, creating new records, and breaking through one point to influence the entire shop. At the same time, they suggested to the shop director and foreman to adjust the labor organization. The administration accepted this suggestion and immediately began publicizing and preparing. When Party member Sun Yueshan, League member Sun Shaozhi, technician Kong Yanbin, Sun Wenqian, and others discussed the issue of adjusting the labor organization, everyone happily said, we have wanted to change for a long time, but we were afraid that the administration wouldn't adopt it. At that time, everyone discussed who would replace the group making steel ingot molds. At this time, several people were vying to go. The leadership proposed that after the shift was changed, three people would make three sets every day. Technician Kong Yanbin said: I can guarantee to make four sets a day with two apprentices (laborers). When Party member Sun Yueshan heard Kong Yanbin raise this issue, he secretly thought that I am stronger than him, so how can I fall behind him. After the issue was discussed, everyone went down separately to coordinate and prepare, and individually discussed with the workers why the steel ingot molds were always made in two sets? Can we change the shift? Technician Yang Qingde said: If the work in our foundry shop is not changed, how can we continue like this? After the preparation, most of the workers agreed to adjust the labor organization. In early March, a general meeting of all employees was held. After the shop director Wu Guangyao announced the decision to appropriately adjust the organization, Party member Sun Yueshan and activist technician Kong Yanbin volunteered to make the steel ingot molds that everyone was unwilling to make. On the same day, their production volume increased from the original four sets to eight sets, doubling the output. In late March, it reached twelve sets, exceeding the original output by two times. Subsequently, the output of steel ingot mold cores also increased to more than two times. The copper melting workers were also unwilling to fall behind, increasing the number of copper melts per day. The iron melting workers increased the output from sixteen tons by opening the furnace once every six days to twenty-five tons of iron by opening the furnace once every four days, ensuring the supply of iron for various sand molds, and automatically reducing one worker. The workers doing odd jobs also automatically joined this mass production competition movement. Even Liu Yiheng, the group leader of the steel ingot mold group who originally thought that production couldn't be increased, also increased production. He increased the production of number 18 wire drawing dies from two to four per day. Liu Yiheng himself said: "I saw that others have increased production and are not conservative with the original quotas anymore. If I don't actively work hard to increase production, how embarrassing would it be? It would seem too backward!" In this way, all the workers in the shop joined this new record creation movement, and the overall production of the shop generally increased by one to two times, and the cost was reduced by 30% to 50%. The task for March was exceeded in twelve days.
    In order to consolidate the workers' production enthusiasm, branch secretary Cui Wannian and Qi Shaoyi convened a workers' symposium and, together with the trade union, promptly suggested that the administration provide rewards. The administration accepted this suggestion and held an award ceremony in mid-March. Among the 116 people in the shop, Sun Yueshan, Kong Yanbin, and 14 other labor models received awards. After the meeting, the workers' production enthusiasm was even higher, and the next day the iron melting increased to a record high of 35 tons. As of April 7, the production of steel ingot molds has increased from the original four sets per day by six people to eighteen sets. These achievements are unprecedented in the foundry shop.

　　天津制钢厂铸造工场突破旧定额中党的工作
    刘致中　郭韵江
    天津制钢厂铸造工场每月的生产成绩总是赶不上其他的场子，工人们生产劲头老是提不起来，干起活来比较松懈。基本原因是少数工人中存在着封建保守的小集团，生产上墨守成规，不肯突破旧定额，阻碍全场生产不能很好提高。个别的师傅领着自己的几个徒弟（小工）在一块作活，私人感情很好，形成了小集团。只要当头的（组长）说一句话，本组人没有不听的，当头的说干大家都干，说休息大家都休息。但是组与组之间却互相观望，谁也不肯把生产提高一步。这样一来，铸造工场的生产便停留在原有的水平上，而无法提高。领班的想把各组的人调动一下，就要遭到落后工人的反对。不是这组不叫抽，就是那组不肯要。其中闹小集团最厉害的是做钢锭模子的小组。这个小组共六人。组长刘义恒，在生产上存在着浓厚的保守旧定额思想。自解放后就是三个人日产钢锭模两付，六人做四付。领班的许凤林向刘义恒提出要增加产量，刘回答说：“这是老规矩了，以往都是这样生产，怎么能提高呢？！”领班的要抽调他组的人，他不让抽调，他说：工人们都不愿意，怕完不成生产任务。工作忙时给他增加人，他也不要，借口生手来了干不了，影响生产。当化铁的时候，由于他们做钢锭模子提不高产量，做零活的小组也在看着他们；做钢锭模信子的小组也不能提高产量（因为有模子限制着）；化铁炉的工人生产情绪也就提不高，经常每六天开一次炉，只化铁十八吨。该场场主任及领班的看到这样情况总想设法改进，但不敢大胆的负起责任来进行劳动组织的调整，怕遭到落后工人的反对，所以未能及时设法改进。
    但解放一年来，一般工人已有了初步阶级觉悟，特别是经过了今年二月的评模运动，启发了工人争取当模范的思想。有的工友暗暗的加油干。老技工孙文谦在二月下旬将化铜罐下的耐火砖加以改造，使化铜产量提高。工友们为了争取当劳动模范，也就要求把整个工场生产提高一步。这时大家就反映做钢锭模子的小组怎么老是做两个呢？但谁也不愿意直接提出要求调换这个组的人，都怕遭到落后工人的讽刺。同时自己的生产量也不愿提高，怕落后的说自己出风头。
    共产党支部书记崔万年、齐绍义深入现场，听取了工友们这些反映后，对该场的情况进行了分析研究。发现生产提不高的基本原因是由于一部分落后工人闹小集团。为了把生产提高一步，而又不影响做钢锭模子工友的情绪，他们便亲自找刘义恒进行谈话，动员他自动提高产量，以便带动全场。但经过几次谈话仍不见效。这时候支部便进行了分散小集团、调整劳动组织的准备。首先动员启发党团员和积极分子带头团结群众，创造新纪录，突破一点影响全场。同时向场主任和领班建议调整劳动组织。行政上接受了这个意见，立即开始宣传酝酿。党员孙曰山、团员孙绍智、技工孔彦彬、孙文谦等在一起商量调整劳动组织的问题时，大家都很高兴地说，我们早想换一换，就是怕行政上不采纳。当时大家就研究谁去替换做钢锭模子。这时几个人都争着要去。领导上提出要求换了班以后，每天三人做三付。技工孔彦彬说：我带两个徒弟（小工）一天准能做四付。党员孙曰山一听孔彦彬提出了这个问题，就暗想我比他的身体强壮，怎样也不能落在他的后面。问题商量好以后，大家分头下去串通酝酿，和工友们个别商量作钢锭模子的为什么老是做两付呢？咱们换一换班是不是可以呢？技工杨庆德说：“咱们铸造场的活如不换一换班，老是像这样还有法作吗？”经过了酝酿，大部工友都同意了调整劳动组织。三月初，召开了全体职工大会。场主任吴光耀宣布适当调整组织的决定后，当场党员孙曰山，积极分子技工孔彦彬自报奋勇作大家不愿做的钢锭模子。当天他们的生产量即由原来做四付增到八付提高产量一倍。三月下旬达到十二付，超过原来产量两倍。接着做钢锭模信的产量也提高到两倍以上。化铜的工友也不甘心落后，将每天的化铜次数增多。化铁工友由原来六天开一次炉出十六吨的产量提高到每四天开炉一次、出铁二十五吨，保证了各种砂型模用铁的供给，并自动减少工友一名。做零活的工友们也自动卷入了这一群众性的生产竞赛运动。连原来认为生产不能提高的制钢锭模子组组长刘义恒也把产量提高了。他做十八号的拉丝盘由日产两个增加到四个。刘义恒自己谈：“我看到别人把产量都提高了，不保守原来的定额了。自己再不积极努力增加产量，脸面上够多么不好看呢？就显着太落后了！”这样一来全场工友都卷入了这一创造新纪录运动，全场产量普遍提高到一倍至两倍以上，成本降低了百分之三十到百分之五十。三月份的任务十二天中就超过了。
    为了巩固工人的生产情绪，支部书记崔万年、齐绍义便召开了工人座谈会，并协同工会及时建议行政上进行奖励。行政上接受了这个意见，于三月中旬召开了发奖大会。全场一一六人中孙曰山、孔彦彬等十四位劳动模范得了奖。会后工人生产情绪更高，第二天化铁便增到三十五吨的最高新纪录。作钢锭模子截至四月七日，已由原来每六人日产四付，增加到十八付。这些成绩在铸造工场来讲，都是空前未有的。
