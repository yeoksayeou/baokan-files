    Beijing No. 3 Middle School Party Branch Secretary
    Wang Lifu Lacks Democratic Style
    Forcing Boarding Students to Work Requires Self-Criticism
    [Our Newspaper] (Reporter Shang Kai reported): Wang Lifu, vice principal and Communist Party branch secretary of Beijing No. 3 Middle School, forced boarding students to participate in labor while organizing students to participate in production, neglected intra-party democracy, and failed to promptly resolve various specific issues in production, resulting in losses to the production work.
    This spring, after the Beijing Municipal Party Congress issued a call to mobilize students to participate in production to improve their lives, the Municipal Production Committee convened several joint meetings of party and government cadres from various schools to conduct ideological mobilization and study production plans, pointing out that students must be mobilized to participate in labor based on the principle of voluntariness.
    After receiving the production tasks assigned by the Municipal Production Committee, the school administration conveyed and arranged this at the weekly meeting on March 13th. After the meeting, Party and League members took the lead actively, and the students' enthusiasm was very high, with more than 90% of the students signing up to participate in production, and a school production committee was established. However, in the senior year of high school, there were seventeen or eighteen students who did not sign up because they wanted to seize the time to review their lessons in preparation for graduation and university entrance exams in the summer. These students usually rarely participate in various activities, and their political ideology is not very developed. Wang Lifu mistakenly believed that the senior high school students' learning views were incorrect, starting from personal interests and planning to become engineers, etc. He criticized them for being "selfish" and not working, and labeled them as "backward elements," holding prejudices against them without patiently educating and guiding them.
    The land allocated to the school was originally outside Xizhimen, but later the Municipal Production Committee changed it to the eastern suburbs, which was far from the school and inconvenient for students to travel to and from (Editor's note: The Municipal Production Committee should try to take these difficulties into account when allocating land). The school production committee then convened a meeting on March 20th to study and redeploy mobilization. Because the living conditions of the school's boarding students were relatively difficult, and to solve the difficulties of the boarding students, and also fearing that the so-called backward students would not participate, Wang Lifu proposed: "Boarding students must participate in production." This proposal was not discussed or voted on, and after the meeting, Principal Sun announced it to the students in public. The senior high school students were in an uproar, and the general students were also quite dissatisfied. After class, everyone clamored and said: "Our production enthusiasm is very good, is there still a need to force us?" Some asked: "The newspaper also said that mobilizing the masses should be conscious and voluntary, why is it forced in our school?" Some also said: "If I am really forced, I will move out if there is a place outside." There were even rumors that: "Whoever doesn't participate will have their scholarship canceled." "Boarding students who don't participate will not be allowed to board," and so on.
    On the same day, after Party members Zhang Xuezeng and Chen Zhanghuan returned to school from attending the Beijing Municipal Student Representative Conference, they heard the students' reactions and immediately thought of the speech by Comrade Liu Ren of the Municipal Party Committee at the Student Representative Conference, which emphasized that organizing students to participate in vegetable planting must be based on the students' willingness and absolutely no mandatory measures should be taken. Zhang Xuezeng and Chen Zhanghuan felt that the school authorities' coercive and commanding style seriously violated the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee, so Zhang Xuezeng (branch committee member) raised his opinion to Wang Lifu. Wang Lifu not only did not recognize his mistake, but said: "Forcing them a little is also good for them." When Zhang Xuezeng further suggested: "For the good of the students, we should mobilize them well. If we force them, it will arouse the students' resentment—besides, only a few people are not participating." Wang Lifu stubbornly said: "The more they are a minority, the more we need to call them to go. We cannot accommodate the backward elements." Zhang Xuezeng and Chen Zhanghuan felt that the principle of voluntariness must be adhered to, and at the same time, the organizational principle must also be followed, so they jointly submitted a written opinion to Wang Lifu, and stated: If you do not agree, please forward it to the Municipal Party Committee. However, Wang Lifu violated the Party's organizational principle and suppressed Chen and Zhang's written opinion and did not submit it to the Municipal Party Committee. It was not until Hou Weicheng from the School Branch Work Section of the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department went to the school on the 26th to investigate the situation that he casually took it out of his pocket. According to Wang Lifu, he was preparing to convene a branch meeting to study it and then submit the situation to the Municipal Party Committee, but the branch meeting was never held, and the written opinion was never submitted.
    After Zhang Xuezeng and Chen Zhanghuan raised their opinions, Wang Lifu also asked political teacher Ji Xirui (a Party member) to collect opinions from the students, but Ji Xirui did not conduct an in-depth investigation and reported back that "there is no specific feedback," so Wang Lifu believed that there was no problem. In fact, not only were the students dissatisfied with his coercive and commanding style, but also many difficulties in production affected the students' production enthusiasm. For example, transportation, seeds, well-drilling loans, production tools, and the organization of manpower were all issues that Wang Lifu failed to discuss with the school production committee in a timely manner, nor did he report to the higher-level production committee. As a result, a lot of manpower and time were wasted.
    On the 26th, Hou Weicheng from the School Branch Work Section went to the school to investigate the situation. In order to maintain the Party's prestige and better promote production work, Hou Weicheng suggested that Wang Lifu and the school authorities should make a public self-criticism to the masses. However, Wang Lifu still insisted on his mistake, believing that it was just a problem of improper work methods. At the same time, he did not understand that when leaders make mistakes, they can only regain or even increase their prestige among the masses by openly admitting and courageously correcting their mistakes. Instead, he believed that if he publicly admitted his mistake to the masses, it would not only lower the leadership's prestige, but also encourage backward emotions. When the reporter was invited by the School Branch Work Section of the Municipal Party Committee to investigate the situation, Wang Lifu still believed that this was only an ideological error and had not become an action, that there were no problems in the school, and that it was only a matter of improper wording, and pushed the error to the objective reason of not having heard Comrade Liu Ren's report, forgetting that a coercive and commanding style is not allowed by the Party at any time or place. Therefore, it was not until the 30th that Wang Lifu asked Ji Xirui to announce that "boarding students can freely participate in production." However, he then announced a counter-voting method: "Whoever does not participate can come forward to sign their name."
    The School Branch Work Section of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that Wang Lifu's mistakes of coercion and commandism and failure to promptly report the opinions of Party members to the higher Party committee show that he lacks understanding of the Party's mass line and intra-Party democracy. In order to educate Party members and himself, Wang Lifu should conduct self-criticism in the branch meeting and in front of the masses, and write a written self-criticism to be published in the newspaper.

### 北京市立三中支部书记  王笠夫缺乏民主作风  强迫住宿学生劳动应作检讨

　　北京市立三中支部书记
    王笠夫缺乏民主作风       
    强迫住宿学生劳动应作检讨
    【本报讯】记者商恺报道：北京市立第三中学副校长，中共支部书记王笠夫，在组织该校学生参加生产中，强迫住宿学生参加劳动，忽视党内民主。并未及时解决生产中的各种具体问题，使生产工作受到损失。
    今春，北京市党代会提出发动学生参加生产改善学生生活的号召后，市生产委员会，曾几次召集各校党、政干部联席会，进行思想动员，研究生产计划，指出：必须根据自觉自愿原则发动学生参加劳动。
    市立三中接到生产委员会布置的生产任务后，学校行政当局遂于三月十三日的周会上传达布置。会后，党团员积极带头，学生情绪非常高涨，百分之九十以上的学生都报名参加生产，并成立了校生产委员会。但在高中三年级里，有十七八个学生因为要抓紧时间温习功课，准备暑期毕业和投考大学，所以没有报名。这一部分同学平常很少参加各种活动，政治思想不甚开展。王笠夫便错误地认为高三的学生学习观点不正确，从个人利益出发，打算考大学作工程师等。责备他们“自私”不劳动，是“落后分子”，对他们怀有成见，未对他们耐心地进行教育诱导。
    该校分得的土地原在西直门外，后市生产委员会又给换到东郊，离校较远，学生来往很不方便（编者按：市生产委员会在分配土地时，应当尽量照顾到这些困难）。校生产委员会遂于三月二十日召集会议，研究重新布置动员。因为该校住宿学生的生活比较困苦。为了解决住宿生的困难，又怕所谓落后学生不参加，王笠夫便提出：“住宿学生必须参加生产”。这个提案未经讨论表决，会后孙校长便向学生当众宣布。高三学生哗然，一般学生也颇为不满。课后大家纷纷嚷嚷地说：“我们生产情绪都很好，还用强迫吗？”有的提出：“报上也说发动群众要自觉自愿，为什么咱们学校里还强迫？”也有的说：“如果真要强迫我，外边有地方我就搬出去。”甚至还有的人传说：“谁不参加就取消他的助学金。”“住宿学生不参加就不许住宿”等等。
    就在同一天，党员章学曾、陈章焕参加京市学生代表会回校后，听到同学们的反映，立刻想到在学代会上市委刘仁同志的讲话中曾强调指出：组织同学参加种菜，一定要根据同学们的自愿，绝不能采取命令的办法。章学曾和陈章焕感觉到学校当局这种强迫命令的作风，严重的违反了市委的精神，便由章学曾（支部委员）向王笠夫提出意见。王笠夫不但不认识自己的错误，反说：“强迫一点，也是对他们有好处的。”当章学曾又提出：为了同学们的好处，就应当很好的去发动，如果强迫命令，便会引起同学们的反感——再说不参加的人只是少数。”王笠夫仍然固执地说：“是少数更需要叫他们去，对落后分子就是不能迁就。”章学曾和陈章焕感到自觉自愿的原则必须坚持，同时组织原则也必须遵守，便又联名提出书面意见交与王笠夫，并注明：如不同意，请转交市委。而王笠夫竟然违背党的组织原则，将陈、章二人的书面意见压下未交市委。直到二十六日市委组织部学校支部工作科派侯维城前往该校调查情况时，才漫不经心的从口袋里拿出来。据王笠夫谈：当时是准备召开支部会研究后，再将情况一并送交市委，但支部会却始终没有开成，意见书也就一直未送。
    在章学曾和陈章焕提出意见后，王笠夫也曾让政治教员姬锡瑞（党员）到学生中搜集意见，但姬锡瑞未作深入调查，便回来报告说：“没有什么具体反映”，因此王笠夫也就认为没有什么问题了。实际上不但学生对他的强迫命令作风不满，而生产中的许多困难也影响了学生的生产情绪。比如交通工具、种籽、打井贷款、生产工具及人力的组织等问题，王笠夫都未商同校生产委员会及时计划解决，也未向上级生产委员会反映报告。结果浪费了不少人力时间。
    二十六日学支科侯维城到该校调查情况。提出为了党的威信，更好地推动生产工作，侯维城提出王笠夫和学校当局应向群众作公开的自我检讨。但王笠夫却仍坚持错误，认为这不过是工作方式不对而已，同时不懂得当领导上犯了错误时，只有公开地承认错误并勇于改正错误才能挽回甚至提高在群众中的威信，反而认为如果向群众公开承认错误，不但降低领导威信，而且会助长落后情绪。当记者应市委学支科邀请前往调查情况时，王笠夫还认为这只是思想上的错误，并未成为行动，学校里并不存在问题，又说只是措词不当等，并且把错误推之于没有听刘仁同志报告的客观原因上，而忘记了强迫命令作风不论在何时何地都是党所不允许的。因此直到三十日，王笠夫才让姬锡瑞宣布“住宿生可以自由参加生产。”但却又宣布了一个反表决的办法：“谁不参加可以到前边来签名。”
    中共北京市委组织部学校支部工作科认为王笠夫在工作中所犯的这种强迫命令和未将党员意见迅速报告上级党委的错误，说明他对党的群众路线和党内民主缺乏认识。为了教育党员和他自己，王笠夫应在支部大会和群众面前进行自我批评，并写出书面检讨，在报纸上发表。
