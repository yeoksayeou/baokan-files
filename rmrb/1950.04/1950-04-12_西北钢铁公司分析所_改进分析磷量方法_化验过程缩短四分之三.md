Northwest Iron and Steel Company Analysis Institute
    Improves Phosphorus Analysis Method
    Testing Process Shortened by Three-Quarters
    [Our Newspaper] Under the personal guidance of Soviet steelmaking expert Gilihof, the Analysis Institute of Northwest Iron and Steel Company created a new record of precipitating the phosphorus content in steel in four and a half minutes. Originally, analyzing phosphorus content at the institute, from weighing the sample to generating the precipitate, generally took more than a quarter of an hour, which prevented timely improvement of the quality of steel. On January 26th, Gilihof personally went to the Analysis Institute to instruct on improving the method of phosphorus analysis, reducing the testing process from sixteen minutes to four and a half minutes. This advanced method was immediately implemented in the laboratory for trial. After two months of practical exercises, it officially began to be used on March 24th. Because the quality of the steel can be quickly known during the steelmaking process, the operation method can be changed in time, thereby improving the quality of the steel.

　　西北钢铁公司分析所
    改进分析磷量方法
    化验过程缩短四分之三
    【本报讯】西北钢铁公司分析所在苏联炼钢专家吉利好夫亲自指导下，创造了四分半钟就可沉淀出钢内含磷量的新纪录。原来该所分析磷量，从秤试料至生成沉淀止，一般需一刻多钟，致使钢的质料不能及时改进。一月二十六日，吉利好夫亲自到分析所指示改进分析磷的方法，化验过程由十六分钟降为四分半钟。这种先进方法当即在化验室普遍试行，经两个月来的实际锻炼，三月二十四日已正式开始运用。由于在炼钢过程中能很快的知道冶钢品质，从而及时的改变操作方法，便可提高钢的质量。
