　　Tianqiao Hawker Li Maolin
    Returns 200,000 Yuan Overpayment to Customer
To the Editor:
    On March 10th, Sergeant Sun Xun of my company bought 74 catties of alkali for 51,800 yuan (old currency) at Li Maolin's stall, number 22, in the Tianqiao People's Market. Due to a moment of carelessness, he gave some 5,000-yuan bills as if they were 500-yuan bills. It was only when he returned to account for the money that he realized he had overpaid 193,300 yuan. Comrade Sun was very anxious at the time. He rushed back to find the alkali seller before even eating. However, it was too late, and all the vendors had left. Comrade Sun had no choice but to return dejectedly.
    The next day, Comrade Sun and several of us went to Tianqiao early in the morning. When Li Maolin saw Comrade Sun arrive, he immediately took out the extra money he had received the day before (the 5,000-yuan bills were untouched). He also comforted Comrade Sun for a while, saying, "This was also due to my carelessness. I thought the money you gave was correct, so I kept it as is. It wasn't until I got home that I realized." Everyone with us was moved by this incident.

　　天桥摊贩李茂林
    退还顾客多付价款二十万编辑同志：
    三月十日，我连上士孙训在天桥人民市场二十二行李茂林的小摊上买碱七十四斤，计洋五万一千八百元，但他一时大意，将一部分五千元的钞票也当做五百元的给了卖碱的了。一直到回来上账时，才发现自己带的钱多付了十九万三千三百元。当时孙同志非常着急，自己连饭也不及吃即速又跑出来找卖碱的，因时间太晚，摊贩都走了，孙同志只得垂头丧气回来。
    第二日，孙同志和我们几个同志一早就又跑到天桥，李茂林见孙同志到来，立刻就将昨天卖碱时所多收的钱取出（五千元钞票原封未动），他还安慰了孙同志一阵，他说：这也是我一时的大意，我以为你们给的钱没错，就原封收下了，直到回家才发现。”我们同行的人，都为这件事感动。
