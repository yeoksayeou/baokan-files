　　Students at Normal University Emphasize Political Study
    Improve Study Organization and Methods

    [Our Newspaper News] Beijing Normal University News Team reports: Since the beginning of this semester's study of On New Democracy, the study of political lessons has been generally valued by students at Normal University, and both study organization and study methods have been improved. The students' views on political lessons are significantly different from when they first started last semester. In the past semester, some students thought that "political lessons are not as important as general cultural lessons"; some thought that "political lessons are specifically for solving ideological problems for relatively backward students"; some thought that they already knew some revolutionary theories and were unwilling to continue in-depth research; and even regarded political lessons as a burden. Later, through the study of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, as well as ideological summaries and learning summaries, the students' ideological understanding has been improved a step further. During the winter vacation, many students participated in the work of the Beijing Spring Festival Science Knowledge Exhibition, and felt that they had not learned enough in actual work. A student who participated in the explanation work of the "From Ape to Man" exhibition said: "I used to think that 'From Ape to Man' was not that difficult, and anyone could explain it clearly, but after 'explaining' it, I realized that I had not learned enough and had to study honestly." At the same time, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China at Normal University and the General Branch of the Communist Youth League at Normal University conveyed Comrade Feng Wenbin's report on school work during the vacation, and held League classes and large classes for Party members and League members, pointing out that political lessons are for establishing a revolutionary outlook on life, clarifying the direction of serving the people, and learning to master the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to discover, analyze, and solve problems. It requires students to learn other courses well on the basis of studying political lessons well. At the same time, it also explained that the work of Party and League members in the school is primarily study. It solved the erroneous thinking of some Party and League members that "work is for the revolution, and study is for the individual." Therefore, Party and League members played an active leading and organizing role in study, and helped students to study together, so that students could study more consciously and spontaneously.

    In terms of organizational form, the Academic Affairs Conference decided that "political lessons are the focus of the Academic Affairs Office's key work," and established a New Democracy Theory Study Committee, composed of the professor in charge and staff and students responsible for propaganda and education of the labor union and student union, responsible for leading the political lesson study of all teachers and students. Deputy Dean Ding Haochuan serves as the chairman. At the same time, the previous middle-level organization leading learning in one college per yuan was changed to one per department. It is composed of a professor, teaching assistant, and student representative, each responsible for promoting and inspecting the study of the department; and stipulates that the head of each department must be responsible for promoting and inspecting the political lesson study of the department. The study groups at the department level have also been adjusted as necessary. Professors and teaching assistants take turns joining each group according to the study unit and study together with the students, so that teachers and students are more closely united. The administrative departments of each department have increased the purchase of some reference books (such as the History Department has 615 reference books), and subscribed to a copy of the People's Daily for each group (some departments have already started, and some are about to implement it). The Study Committee also issued must-read materials, such as On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, The Current Situation and Our Tasks, etc. In order to cooperate with the study of political lessons, the library has specially opened up a place in the reading room to display reference materials related to the current political lesson teaching unit.

    In terms of learning methods, in addition to large classes, self-study is generally the main method, supplemented by collective discussion. Many groups have also created new learning methods to correct the shortcomings of past discussions lacking preparation, in-depth discussions, or only a few people speaking.

    In order to help students study political lessons well, the school's broadcasting team has specially added "study time" at noon every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, in addition to introducing the study and discussion of various groups in the school, and also introducing the study situation of other institutions and groups outside the school. At the same time, a "point-calling platform" was established, stipulating that if there are unresolved problems, they can be submitted to the "point-calling platform" for other groups to answer, so that each group can help each other and compete with each other. After listening to the "study time" broadcast by the broadcasting team, many students said in unison: "I was originally a bit vague about this issue, but now I understand it."

　　师大同学重视政治学习
    改进学习组织和学习方法
    【本报讯】北京师范大学通讯组报道：自本学期开始学习新民主主义论以来，政治课的学习在师大已普遍的为同学们所重视，学习组织与学习方法均有改进。同学们对于政治课的看法，和上学期刚开始时已有显著的不同。在上学期，还有一部分同学以为“政治课不如一般文化课重要”；有的以为“政治课是专为比较落后的同学解决思想问题的”；有的则以为自己已知道了一些革命理论，不肯继续深入的钻研；甚至视政治课为负担。后来通过辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的学习及思想总结、学习总结等，同学们的思想认识已提高了一步。在寒假中，许多同学参加了北京市春节科学知识展览会的工作，在实际工作中感到学习得不够。一位参加“从猿到人”展览的解说工作的同学说：“从前以为‘从猿到人’还不是那么一套，谁都能解说清楚，但是一经‘解说’后，才知道学的不够，非得老老实实地学习不可。”同时，中共师大总支委员会和青年团师大总支部在假期中传达了冯文彬同志关于学校工作的报告外，并举办了团课、党团员大课等，指出了政治课是为了确立革命的人生观，明确为人民服务的方向，并学习掌握马列主义的立场、观点、方法来发现问题、分析问题、解决问题。要求同学们要在学好政治课的基础上来学好其他课程。同时，又说明了学校中党、团员的工作首先是学习。解决了一部分党、团员存在着的“工作为革命，学习为个人”的错误思想。所以党、团员在学习中，起了积极带头推动与组织的作用，并且帮助同学和同学们在一起学习，使同学们更能够自动自发地来学习。
    在组织形式上，教务会议曾决定“政治课是教务处重点工作中的重点”，并且成立了新民主主义论学习委员会，由任课教授及工会、学生会负责宣教工作的员生共同组成，负责领导全体师生政治课的学习。由副教务长丁浩川任主任委员。同时将上学期一院一个领导学习的中层机构改为一系一个。由教授、讲助、学生代表各一人组成，负责推动检查本系的学习；并规定各系主任对本系政治课学习须负推动与检查的责任。各系级的学习小组也作了必要的调整。教授、助教按学习单元轮流加入各小组和同学们一同学习，使师生团结得更紧密些。各系行政方面均增购了一部分参考书（如历史系已有参考书六一五本），并给每一小组订人民日报一份（有的系已开始，有的即将实行）。学习委员会亦印发必须阅读的资料，如论人民民主专政、目前形势和我们的任务等。图书馆为了配合政治课的学习，特在阅览室内开辟一块地方陈列与当前政治课教学单元有关的参考资料。
    在学习方法上，除上大课外，一般均是以自学为主，集体讨论为辅。许多小组并创造出了新的学习方法，纠正了过去讨论会缺乏准备，讨论不能深入；或仅有少数人发言等缺点。
    该校广播组为帮助同学们学好政治课，特于每星期二、四、六中午增辟“学习时间”，除介绍本校各小组学习讨论情况外，并介绍校外和其他机关团体学习情况。同时还成立“点将台”，规定遇有未解决问题，可提交“点将台”请别的小组解答，这样可使各小组彼此互助，相互竞赛。不少同学在听了广播组的“学习时间”广播之后，异口同声地说：“对这个问题我原来也有些模糊，现在可弄明白了。”
