　　Prevention and Treatment Methods for Flea Beetles
    Disease and Pest Control Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    In the rapeseed fields of the Fifth District of Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, flea beetles have infested more than 700 mu. Each rapeseed plant has 30 to 40 beetles on it. This pest, known locally as "black shell bug" or "stooping bug," is extremely harmful. Besides eating rapeseed, it is also a major pest of cabbage and radish. According to the experience of the local people, rapeseed fields unaffected by pests can yield five or six dou of rapeseed per mu. If pests infest, the yield can be reduced, or even result in no harvest at all, leading to very significant losses. The area for rapeseed cultivation in North China is very large. This spring came early, and the occurrence of flea beetles may be earlier than usual. We must be vigilant, pay attention to prevention, and eliminate them promptly if they occur. We now introduce several relatively effective prevention and treatment methods for reference in various regions.
    The flea beetle is a black-shelled insect about the size of half a mung bean, entirely purplish-black, and specifically harms vegetable leaves. Each female insect can lay more than 500 eggs, which are orange-yellow and clustered in egg masses of several dozen, laid in the cracks of the soil and under the vegetable plants. The larvae are brownish-black, small at the head and tail, thick in the middle, with black raised spots on the back of each segment. They also crawl on the vegetable leaves to cause harm. When they mature, they burrow into the soil to pupate. The pupae are orange-yellow, and after ten days or so, they transform into black shell beetles. This insect occurs twice a year, and adults, larvae, pupae, and eggs can all overwinter. During cold weather, they hide in surface soil cracks, under vegetable leaf litter, and in weeds to avoid freezing. They begin to emerge around March of the following year. April and May are the most severe months for harm. In autumn, the most severe period is from August to October. Infested vegetable leaves are riddled with holes if the infestation is light, and the green leaves are completely eaten if the infestation is heavy, leaving only petioles and veins, resulting in no harvest.
    Prevention and Treatment Methods:
    (1) Mud Smear Method: When disturbed, adults and larvae will contract their legs and fall to the ground, feigning death. We can take advantage of this weakness by using a basin or pot filled with mud (preferably with some kerosene added), gently holding it under the infested vegetable, and then tapping the vegetable plant with a stick, shaking the leaves. The insects, startled, will roll into the basin, get coated with mud, and be unable to crawl. By doing this one vegetable plant at a time, many insects can be caught. This method is less labor-intensive than hand-picking, and the results are also better. It is especially suitable for use in rapeseed fields.
    (2) Wooden Board Crushing Method: In rapeseed fields, local people use a small wooden board, about two fingers wide, to tap the vegetable plants, startling the flea beetles to fall to the ground, and then immediately crushing the insects in place with the wooden board. This is also a good treatment method, but it is more labor-intensive than the mud smear method described above.
    (3) Sand Barrier Method: In areas where the insects are spreading, if your own field has not yet been infested, quickly use fine sandy soil (the looser the soil, the better) to build a sand dike five or six inches wide around the field, enclosing the vegetable patch. Insects outside the dike, if they climb onto the sand dike, will roll down and be unable to invade and cause harm. In areas with more water, small ditches can be dug around the perimeter and filled with water to prevent pests from climbing in, which is even more effective.
    (4) Derris Powder Spray Method: Use one jin of derris powder (i.e., derris root powder), three liang to five liang and two qian of soap, and one hundred and twenty jin of clean water. For the mixing method, first take a bowl of warm water, chop the soap into small pieces, and put it in to dissolve into soapy water. Then pour in the derris powder, mix it into a paste, and then pour in the clean water, stirring with a stick while pouring, to form derris powder spray. Use a sprayer to spray the solution on the vegetable leaves. Insects that come into contact with the spray, or eat the leaves with the spray on them, will die. This spray should be mixed and used immediately, otherwise, the potency will not be strong.
    (5) Lead Arsenate Spray Method: Use one jin of lead arsenate (calcium arsenate can also be used), add two hundred jin of clean water, mix evenly, and spray on the vegetable leaves with a sprayer. The insects will be poisoned and die after eating it.
    (6) Winter Trapping Method: When winter is approaching and the insects are looking for places to shelter from the cold and overwinter, we can dig several pits in the vegetable field and pile discarded vegetable leaves and weeds in the pits. Many insects will crawl in to hide. When many insects have crawled in, we can add some soil on top to bury the insects and suffocate them to death. This method can reduce many insects, but it cannot eradicate them.

　　猿叶虫的防治法
    中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治局
    平原省修武县五区的油菜地里发生猿叶虫，为害的面积七百多亩，每株菜上有虫三十至四十个。这种害虫，老乡们叫做乌壳虫，或弯腰虫，为害极广，除吃油菜外，又是白菜、萝卜的大虫害。据老乡们的经验，未受虫害的油菜，每亩地可打菜籽五六大斗，如遇虫害，轻的要减产，重的就没有收成，损失非常重大。华北各地区，种油菜的面积很广大，今春早暖，猿叶虫的发生，可能提早一些，我们要提高警觉，注意防范，一有发生，及时消灭。现在介绍几种比较有效的防治方法，以供各地采择。
    猿叶虫是半粒绿豆大小的黑壳虫，全体紫黑色，专害菜叶。每一雌虫能产卵五百余粒，卵橙黄色，集数十粒为一卵堆，产在泥土的裂缝间，和菜株的下面。幼虫黑褐色，头尾小，中段粗，各节背上有黑色突起的斑点，也是爬在菜叶上为害的，等到长熟时，即钻入土中化蛹。蛹体橙黄色，过了十几天，就变为黑壳虫了。此虫每年发生两次，成虫、幼虫、蛹、卵都能越冬，寒冷时躲在表土缝里或菜叶垃圾下和杂草中避冻，到下年三月间，就开始出动。四五两个月，为害最烈。秋季以八月至十月最烈。被害菜叶，轻的被吃成不少孔洞，重的绿叶全被吃光，仅余叶柄及叶脉，就没有收成了。
    防治方法：
    （一）污泥沾杀法：成虫幼虫遇到了惊动，即缩脚落地装死。我们可以利用它这弱点，用盆子或钵盛污泥（最好加些火油），轻轻张在有虫子的菜下，再用棒敲打菜株，震动叶片，虫子受惊，就滚落在盆钵里，沾着污泥，不能爬动。如此一棵一棵菜株做下去，可以捉掉不少虫子。这种方法，比赤手捕捉要省工些，而且收效也好。尤以在油菜地里应用此法，为最适宜。
    （二）木板压杀法：平原省的老乡们，在油菜地里用一根二指宽的小木板，敲打菜株，震惊猿叶虫落地，随手用木板把虫子就地压死，这也是个好治法，不过比较上述的沾杀法，要费工些。
    （三）堆砂阻断法：在虫子蔓延的地区，如自己地里还没发生虫子，赶快用细砂土（土愈松愈好）在田的四周堆成五六寸宽的砂堤，把菜地围好，堤外的虫子，如爬到砂堤上，就滚落下来，不能侵入为害了。在水多的地方，可把四周围开小沟，灌水入沟，阻止害虫爬入，效力更好。
    （四）鱼藤粉药水喷杀法：用鱼藤粉（即德利斯粉）一斤，肥皂三两至五两二钱，清水一百二十斤。配合方法，先取一碗温水，把肥皂切碎，放入溶成肥皂水，再把鱼藤粉倒入，调成糊状，然后把清水倒进去，一面倒一面用棒搅拌，就成为鱼藤粉药水了。再用喷雾器把药水打在菜叶上，虫子沾着药水，或把有药的叶子吃下肚去，都要死亡的。这种药水，要随配随用，否则药力不强大。
    （五）砒酸铅药水喷杀法：用砒酸铅（砒酸钙亦可用）一斤，加清水二百斤，调和均匀，用喷雾器喷布在菜叶上，虫子食后，即中毒死亡。
    （六）冬季诱杀法：冬季将寒时，虫子要寻找避寒的地方越冬，我们可在菜地里掘几个坑，把废弃的菜叶和杂草堆在坑里，就有不少虫子钻进去躲藏，等虫钻入很多，我们可在上面加些泥土，把虫子压在里面闷死。用此法可以减少很多虫子，但不能灭绝。
