　　When the People's Liberation Army's advance landing force marched towards Baisha County, it received a warm welcome from the Li people along the way. As soon as the troops arrived in Hesheng City, Li people from dozens of miles away prepared pigs, cattle, chickens, bananas, and peanuts overnight to慰劳 (wèiláo - express sympathy and appreciation to; give comfort to) the People's Liberation Army. They also spontaneously gathered two hundred civilian laborers and rushed to Hesheng City to carry the wounded and ammunition for our army. The Li people along the way cleaned their houses spotlessly, waiting for the army to stay. Women spontaneously set up tea stations and organized sewing teams. To ensure the army had ample supplies, many Li people donated most of their rice. The Li people of Benyun Township, who suffered the most from the Chiang bandits' "sweeping up," and who lived on sweet potatoes year-round, upon hearing that the army had landed, came from seventy or eighty miles away, carrying baskets of sweet potatoes, chickens, and piglets, helping the old and carrying the young to welcome the People's Liberation Army. When they saw the magnificent ranks of the People's Liberation Army passing by, they couldn't help but have tears in their eyes, murmuring words of blessing.
　　On March 11, when the people of Baisha County held a meeting to welcome the cross-sea army, Li people from all four villages and deep in the mountains came to participate. Hundreds of Li people led cattle and sheep, carried pigs, and brought chickens, bananas, coconuts, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and other慰劳 (wèiláo - express sympathy and appreciation to; give comfort to) goods to慰劳 (wèiláo - express sympathy and appreciation to; give comfort to) the People's Liberation Army. When the People's Liberation Army troops entered the venue, gongs and drums and firecrackers sounded everywhere. At the meeting, a Li person wearing a mask danced a local folk dance and sang simple and moving Li songs. The Li people cheered thunderously and followed along with the dance. For a time, slogans and cheers rang out in one piece. Before the soldiers could sit down, dozens of Li people with large and small baskets poured out from the crowd, enthusiastically jumped into the ranks, and gave bananas, peanuts, sugarcane, and other items to the soldiers. An old Li person who had participated in the armed resistance against the Kuomintang's oppression found a translator to tell the soldiers about the Kuomintang bandit gang's cruel oppression of the Li people and their tenacious and unyielding struggle with the enemy. Finally, he said, "Now the savior has arrived, and the Kuomintang will never dare to bully us again!" The Li people's love for the People's Liberation Army greatly moved the soldiers. At the meeting, a representative of the People's Liberation Army comforted the Li people, saying, "We are the sons of the people. The people of Baisha suffered the destruction of the Kuomintang bandit gang, just like my parents suffered the destruction of the bandit gang. We are determined to completely eliminate the remaining bandit gangs on Hainan Island and avenge you!" (Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 22nd)

　　黎胞狂热欢迎登陆大军先锋部队
    随军记者  路以丁
    人民解放军登陆先锋部队向白沙县挺进的时候，沿途受到黎胞的热烈欢迎。队伍刚到和盛市，远在几十里以外的黎胞就连夜准备了猪、牛、鸡、香蕉、花生等着慰劳解放军，并且自动集合了二百民工赶到和盛市为我军抬伤员、扛弹药。沿途黎胞都把房子打扫得干干净净，等着大军来住。妇女们自动地设茶水站、组织缝纫队。为了使大军给养无缺，很多黎胞把米大部都献出来。被蒋匪“扫荡”得最惨的畚匀乡的黎胞，终年靠吃白地瓜过活，一听说大军登陆了，就从七八十里外拿着满筐满篓的地瓜，提着小鸡、小猪，扶老携幼地赶来欢迎解放军。当他们亲眼看见人民解放军的雄伟行列经过时，不禁眼泪盈眶，口中喃喃地念着祝祷的话语。
    三月十一日白沙县人民开会欢迎渡海大军时，四乡和深山中的黎胞都赶来参加了。成百黎胞牵着牛、羊，抬着猪，拿着鸡、香蕉、椰子、甘蔗、地瓜等慰劳品来慰劳解放军。当人民解放军的队伍步入会场时，四处就响起了锣鼓声和鞭炮声。会上，一位黎胞戴着假面具，跳着土风舞，唱着淳朴动听的黎歌。黎胞们欢声雷动，纷纷跟着舞蹈起来。一时，口号声和欢呼声响成一片。战士们还没有坐下，从人群中就涌出来几十个提着大小篓筐的黎胞，热情地跳入队伍中间，把香蕉、花生、甘蔗等物送给战士们。一个曾参加过武装反抗国民党压榨的老黎胞，找了一个翻译来，向战士们诉说国民党匪帮对黎胞残酷压迫的情形和他们与敌人顽强不屈地斗争的故事。最后他说：“现在救星来了，国民党再不敢来欺侮我们了！”黎胞们对解放军的热爱，使战士们大受感动。会上，一位解放军的代表向黎胞们安慰说：“我们是人民的儿子，白沙人民受国民党匪帮的摧残，就是我的父母受匪帮们摧残。我们坚决要彻底消灭海南岛的残余匪帮，为你们复仇！”（新华社海南前线二十二日电）
