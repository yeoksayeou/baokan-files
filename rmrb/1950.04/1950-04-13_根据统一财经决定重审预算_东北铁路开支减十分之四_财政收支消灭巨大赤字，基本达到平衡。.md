Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th - The Northeast Railway Bureau recently re-examined the 1950 budget of its five subordinate management bureaus and directly-affiliated factories, resulting in a 40% reduction in this year’s Northeast Railway expenditure. This has eliminated the huge deficit in Northeast Railway's fiscal revenue and expenditure, basically achieving a balance. The Northeast Railway Bureau's re-examination of the budget was carried out in accordance with the policy of the "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. Each unit of the bureau conducted on-site investigations and studies of the planned major projects, distinguished between priorities, reduced many secondary and unnecessary projects, and concentrated efforts on key areas. At the same time, before reviewing the budget, each bureau, based on its investigation and research on major projects under its jurisdiction, self-reported existing assets and automatically compressed expenditures, which facilitated the smooth progress of the review work. For example, the Jinzhou Railway Administration's plan last year to restore the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan double track still required 80 kilometers of steel rails after two revisions; after repeated on-site investigation and collection of scattered steel rails along the line, it turned out that only 28 kilometers of steel rails needed to be supplemented. After on-site inspection and careful statistics of the existing number of sleepers by the Jilin and Jinzhou Railway Administrations, the number of sleepers that needed to be replaced this year was also reduced by more than 200,000 compared with the original budget plan. In terms of personnel streamlining, after this review, except for the Qiqihar Railway Administration, which was indeed short of personnel, the remaining bureaus had sufficient personnel; the Jinzhou, Shenyang, and Jilin Railway Administrations had a total surplus of more than 3,100 people over the authorized strength, and they are now preparing to properly allocate them to other jobs.

The Northeast Railway Bureau's method of re-examining the budget this time was to review each bureau and each item concretely and strictly. Before reviewing each bureau, it first announced the overall policy, then listened to the comprehensive budget report of the head of the administration, and then each competent department made detailed reports on each item, and finally the budget review committee organized by the bureau conducted a detailed review of each item. During the review, in addition to the principles of giving priority to important projects, careful calculation, etc., attention was also paid to determining the order of the projects, determining the source of materials and the time of arrival, engineering organization, and other issues. Whenever the final review of a bureau's budget was completed, the review committee drafted a draft order, attached with detailed engineering, material, and financial plans, and submitted it to the Director-General for approval and promulgation.

　　根据统一财经决定重审预算
    东北铁路开支减十分之四
    财政收支消灭巨大赤字，基本达到平衡。
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北铁路总局最近重新审查了所属五个管理局及直属厂务部的一九五○年度预算，结果使今年东北铁路开支减少了百分之四十。从而使东北铁路财政收支消灭了巨大赤字，基本上达到平衡。东北铁路总局这次重新审查预算的工作是根据中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”的方针进行的。该局各单位曾对计划中的主要工程进行了实地调查研究，分别轻重缓急，减少了许多次要和不必要的工程，集中力量投入主要方面。同时，在审查预算前，各局都根据对管辖内重要工程的调查研究，自报旧存资财，自动压缩开支，使审查工作得以顺利进行。如锦州管理局去年所作修复沈（阳）山（海关）复线的计划，经两次修正还须要补充八十公里钢轨，此次经过反复实地清查并搜集沿线零散钢轨后，结果只须补充二十八公里的钢轨。吉林、锦州两管理局经实地检查和仔细地统计现有枕木数目，亦使今年须要更换的枕木较原预算计划减少二十余万根。在人员精简方面，经过这次审查，除齐齐哈尔管理局确实缺人外，其余各局人员都有敷余，锦州、沈阳、吉林三管理局共超过定员三千一百余人，现正准备适当分配其他工作。
    东北铁路总局这次重新审查预算的办法，是具体而又严格地逐局逐项审查。在每审查一个局之前，首先宣布总的方针，然后听取该管理局长的全面预算报告，再分门别类由其各主管部门逐项作详细报告，最后由总局组织的预算审查委员会逐项详细审查。在审查中，除依据工程的轻重缓急、精打细算等原则外，并注意拟定工程的先后，确定材料的来源及到达的时间、工程组织等问题。每当一个局的预算最后审查完毕，即由审查委员会起草命令草案，附带拟定详细的工程、材料、财政三个计划的附件，交总局长批准后公布。
