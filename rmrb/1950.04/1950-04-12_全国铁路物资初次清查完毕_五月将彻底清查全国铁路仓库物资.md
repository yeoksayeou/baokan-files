Xinhua News Agency, 11th. National railway material supply work has begun to move towards unified planning and unified allocation. This is the result of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government organizing material inventory teams to conduct an inventory of 174 major materials in the Southern and Northern Railway Administrations from November of last year to February of this year (the Northeast had already conducted an inventory last year). Through this inventory, the Ministry of Railways began to grasp the inventory situation and the quantity of major materials of the national railways, and was able to carry out unified allocation. For example, in the material supply plan for the first quarter of this year, more than 30 percent of the major materials that should be solved by the Ministry of Railways were obtained from the inventory warehouses. This saved the country a large amount of financial expenditure. During the inventory, it was discovered that many materials could be utilized. In the Tianjin Materials Factory alone, useful materials worth approximately 1.24 billion yuan were cleared from waste materials. The Jinan Railway Administration also cleared a large number of vehicle parts from scrap iron. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration cleared a large number of unreported materials, such as bamboo-jointed round steel, copper, and boiler plates, which are very valuable materials. During this inventory, many steel materials that had become waste due to the lack of unified material management in the past and the failure to use them in time were also discovered in various places. The Ministry of Railways has decided to hand over all these steel materials to the state for use as industrial raw materials. In the first quarter's plan, the Ministry of Railways has supplied the Ministry of Heavy Industry with more than 3,000 tons of scrap steel, in exchange for useful machines. In addition, there are many equipment that can be applied with slight repairs. For example, the Zhang Huabin Factory of the Shanghai Railway Administration discovered 152 various machine lathes, hundreds of tons of large smoke pipes, 200 gasoline pumps, and mobile houses that had been damaged and burned by the enemy, all of which can be repaired and applied. After unified inventory by various railway administrations, the Ministry of Railways can uniformly allocate them to communicate with each other, supplement each other, and solve material difficulties. For example, locomotive wheels are one of the most important materials in China at present. Last year, the railway factories in the Northeast and Tianjin Railway Administrations could not release the repaired locomotives from the warehouse due to the lack of wheels. Only after the inventory did they discover that the Hengyang Railway Administration had more than 4,000 wheels that could not be used. Smoke pipes and grease are also materials that the Northern Railway Administration lacks very much, but the Shanghai and Hengyang Railway Administrations have relatively abundant reserves.

　　When the Ministry of Railways started the material inventory work, it encountered ideological resistance from some railway bureau cadres, who believed that "after the unified management and allocation of materials, it would be inconvenient for this unit to use materials," and therefore adopted a passive resistance attitude towards the inventory work. For example, when the inventory team arrived at Xinyang Railway, the military representative even denied receiving the order from the Ministry of Railways regarding the inventory of materials. After reluctantly finding the telegram, he still denied it, saying: "I am very busy with work and have no time to manage it." Other leading cadres did not dare to openly say that the inventory of materials was not good, but they showed passivity in their actions, such as sending cadres with very low quality to assist the inventory team in carrying out the work; some believed that the cleaning of materials was a matter for the material department and had nothing to do with others. This ideological resistance greatly hindered the progress of the inventory work, and was gradually overcome after great efforts by the inventory team.

　　From the four-month inventory work, it was also found that there are still many serious shortcomings in the material departments of various railway administrations that urgently need to be improved: 1. Bureaucratic work style is prevalent - most of the leading cadres of material departments at all levels are not proficient in business and do not go deep into their work. Material managers do not know the number of materials, the material affairs section does not have material accounts, and they temporarily inquire about the materials from the material factory when checking materials. The Planning and Allocation Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration did not know that it had a large number of turnouts in stock, but instead requested the Ministry of Railways to allocate them. 2. The phenomenon of material waste is very serious - during the major line overhaul of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration last year, it was emphasized that the task was urgent, and a large number of splints were received. After the project was completed, a large number of splints were placed on the roadside. It was even discovered that someone in the Kaifeng section took splints and sold them to blacksmiths, who then sold them to the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's material department at a high price. Last year, during the construction of the Luohe Bridge project, only 70 percent of the materials were used, and the remaining materials were discarded and no one cared about them. In addition, the phenomena of poor material maintenance, chaotic warehouse management systems, and chaotic material receiving systems also seriously exist in various railway administrations.

　　For this reason, the Ministry of Railways has decided to conduct a thorough inventory of national railway material warehouses again in mid-May; at the same time, it will also accept the lesson of encountering ideological resistance from some leading cadres at the beginning of the last inventory, and decided to strengthen the pre-publicity, education and mobilization work, such as running training courses for inventory personnel, convening a national railway material warehouse inventory and allocation meeting, making typical demonstrations, formulating unified standards, etc.; and absorb the most experienced technicians and engineers to participate in the inventory work, in order to thoroughly clean up and handle the existing materials.
Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government held a national railway warehouse material inventory and allocation meeting from the 6th to the 10th of this month. The meeting discussed, revised and approved the measures for carrying out the national railway warehouse material inventory and allocation work. The measures clearly stipulate the organization of the railway system's warehouse material inventory work, the scope of the inventory, the regular reporting and unified reporting system, and stipulate that the national railways will conduct the inventory simultaneously from May 16th to 30th. This inventory will be carried out in conjunction with the general survey decided by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council. Material inventory materials and equipment, collected railway equipment, unrecorded materials, surplus engineering materials, materials in transit, complete and damaged steel beams, as well as machines being produced, raw materials to be used, finished products, and semi-finished products are all within the scope of the inventory. All railway administrations shall complete the preparation work such as sorting and concentrating materials before May 15th, and mobilize cadres from political departments, trade unions, and youth leagues at all levels to cooperate with the administrative aspects to carry out publicity and education, so that the cleaning of materials becomes one of the important tasks for everyone to be responsible for the country's economic construction. The results of the inventory by each railway administration shall be reported to the Ministry before June 20th, and the Ministry of Railways shall complete all statistical summary work by the end of June. The political department, trade union, and youth league of the Ministry of Railways will each send cadres and technical and engineering personnel from the Ministry to form seven working groups in the Northeast, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Hengyang, and Shanghai to assist the work of each railway administration in the near future. In addition, in order to improve the efficiency of the inventory work, the meeting decided to establish a reward system, and use the railway's unique technical equipment, telephones, telegrams, etc. to strengthen communication work and exchange experiences in a timely manner. The representatives of each railway administration who attended the meeting unanimously expressed their confidence in completing the inventory work on time. Each railway administration has challenged each other, guaranteeing that their unit will do a good and fast job of the inventory work. Finally, all the representatives unanimously passed a challenge competition to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, stating that the Ministry of Railways should strive to be a model in the national public enterprise inventory work.

　　全国铁路物资初次清查完毕
    五月将彻底清查全国铁路仓库物资
    【新华社十一日讯】全国铁路材料供应工作已开始走上统一计划、统一调配的道路。这是中央人民政府铁道部于去年十一月至今年二月间组织材料清查团到南方、北方各路局进行了一百七十四种主要材料的清点工作的结果（东北已在去年进行了清查）。经过这次清点，铁道部开始掌握了全国铁路材料的库存情况和主要材料的数量，得以进行统一的调配。如今年第一季度的材料供应计划中，应由铁道部解决的主要材料部分有百分之三十以上是从清点仓库中获得解决的。这使国家节省了一大笔财政支出。在清点中发现可资利用的材料很多，仅天津材料厂一个仓库中即从废料中清出约值十二亿四千余万元有用的材料。济南局也从废铁中清出大批车辆配件。郑州局清出大批漏报材料如竹节元钢、紫铜、锅炉钣等很宝贵的材料。此次清点中，各地还发现了许多因过去材料管理不统一、未能及时运用而变成废料的钢铁。铁道部已决定将这些钢铁全部交给国家用作工业原料。第一季计划中铁道部已供应重工业部三千多吨废钢，换回了有用的机器。另外稍加修理即可应用的器材也很多。如上海局张华滨厂发现有被敌人破坏烧损的各种机器镟床一百五十二台、大烟管数百吨、汽油水泵二百台及活动房屋等，均可修理应用。各个铁路管理局经过统一清查后，由铁道部统一调配即可互通有无，互相补充，解决材料困难。譬如机车外轮是目前我国极重要的材料之一，去年东北及天津局的铁路机厂均因缺乏外轮而致已修理好的机车不能出库，清查后才发现衡阳局存有四千多个外轮用不上。烟管和油脂也是北方铁路极缺乏的材料，上海局和衡阳局存量却较丰富。
    铁道部清查材料工作开始时，曾遭遇到若干铁路局干部的思想抵抗，这些干部认为“材料统一管理调拨后，本单位用料就不方便”，因而对清查工作采取消极抵抗的态度。例如清查团到信阳铁路时，军事代表竟否认曾接到铁道部关于清点材料的命令，等到勉强找出电报后，还抵赖说：“我工作很忙，没空管。”另有一些领导干部不敢公然说清查材料不好，但在行动中却表示消极，如派质量很低的干部来协助清查团进行工作；有些则认为清理材料是材料部门的事，与别人无干。这种思想抵抗大大妨碍了清查工作的进行，经过清查团很大努力后才逐渐克服。
    从四个月的清查工作中，也发现了目前各地路局材料部门中还存在很多严重缺点急待改进：一、官僚作风普遍存在——各级材料部门领导干部，大部分对业务不熟练，工作不深入。管料员不知道材料数目，料务课没有料账，查料时临时向材料厂打听。上海局计配课不知自己库存道岔很多，反而向铁道部请求拨给。二、材料浪费现象很严重——郑州局工务处去年线路大修中，强调任务急，领下夹板数量很大，工程做完，大批夹板置于路旁。甚至还发现开封段有人拿夹板卖给铁匠，铁匠再大价卖给郑州局材料处。去年建筑洛河便桥工程中，材料只用了百分之七十，剩下材料弃置没人过问。此外，材料保养工作不良、仓库管理制度和领料制度混乱的现象，在各地铁路局也严重存在。
    为此，铁道部已决定在五月中再次进行全国铁路物资仓库的彻底清查工作；同时并接受上次清查开始遭遇若干领导干部思想抵抗的教训，决加强事前的宣传教育动员工作，如开办清点人员训练班，召开全国铁路物资仓库清查调配会议，作典型示范，制订统一标准等；并吸收最有经验的技术人员、工程师参加清点工作，以求彻底清理和处理现有材料。
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府铁道部于本月六日至十日举行了全国铁路仓库物资清查调配会议。会议讨论修正并通过了全国铁路仓库物资清理调配工作进行办法。该办法明确规定了铁路系统的清查仓库物资工作组织、清点范围、定期汇报及统一表报制度，并规定全国铁路同时于五月十六日至三十日进行清查。这一清查与政务院财政经济委员会决定的普查工作结合进行。材料库存物资器材、已搜集之铁路器材、未经整理入账之物资材料、工程剩余材料、输送在途中的材料、完整和损坏的钢梁，以及正在进行生产的机器、待用原料、成品、半成品等，一律在清查范围之内。各路局于五月十五日前完成整理和集中材料等准备工作，并动员各级政治部、工会、青年团干部，配合行政方面，进行宣传教育，使清理材料成为每个人对国家经济建设负责的重要工作之一。各管理局清查结果均于六月二十日前报部，铁道部于六月底完成全部统计总结工作。铁道部机关政治部、工会、青年团将各派干部与部内材料技术人员工程师共同组成东北、天津、济南、太原、郑州、衡阳、上海七个工作团，于最近前往各管理局帮助工作。此外，为了提高清查工作效率，会议确定建立奖励制度，并利用铁路特有技术设备、电话、电报等加强通讯工作，及时交流经验。参加会议的各局代表一致表示有信心准时完成清查工作。各局之间已互相挑战，保证本单位把清查工作做得又好又快。最后全体代表一致通过向重工业部提出挑战竞赛，表示铁道部要争取在全国公营企业清查工作中做模范。
