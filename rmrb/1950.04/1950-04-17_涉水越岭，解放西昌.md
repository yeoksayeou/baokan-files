　　Wading Through Rivers and Mountains, Liberating Xichang
　　Zheng Dafan
　　On March 22nd, a unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing from the south crossed the Jinsha River from Qiaojia County in northeastern Yunnan, marching towards Xichang. The river water churned, and the boats rose and fell four or five feet with the waves, disappearing into the bottom of the waves for a moment, then emerging again, as if drilling out of the water. The soldiers excitedly shouted, "Crossing the Yellow River, crossing the Yangtze River, today we cross the Jinsha River again!" "Following the glorious road of the old Red Army!" The cheers drowned out the sound of the waves. We crossed the river at 3:00 PM, and it was dark when we reached Hongtu Ridge near the river.
　　The peaks of Hongtu Ridge seemed to be connected to the clouds, and the deep valleys and cliffs were bottomless. Gusts of wind blew from the Jinsha River, blowing egg-sized gravel from the top of the mountain, hitting helmets with a clang. Many people's helmets, backpacks, and cotton-padded clothes were also blown into the river. Two soldiers from the guard company were also swept off the cliff by the gale. The soldiers wrapped their guns in blankets and tied them tightly to their backs, grabbing each other's belts and squatting down step by step. After descending the mountain, we came to an iron chain bridge. Two large iron chains were tied to the cliffs at both ends, with a bottomless abyss below. It swayed precariously underfoot, and only one person could cross every five steps. The soldiers cautiously walked to the other side of the bridge.
　　After descending Hongtu Ridge, the weather was as hot as fire. After passing the treacherous Qiao (jia) Ning (nan) road, we encountered another large mountain, with no even a narrow path available. The soldiers carefully grabbed the cracks in the rocks and climbed up step by step, all covered in sweat, gasping for breath. After climbing a section of rocky slope, the mountain above was scorched by wildfires, making it even more difficult to climb. Some climbed halfway up the mountain and rolled back down. Despite the difficult road, the soldiers still competed to carry the ninety-jin infantry gun. It was so dark that we could not see the road, one step high and one step low, our heads were dizzy.
　　At this time, the order "Prepare to take off your pants and wade across the Jinsha River" came from the front, and the soldiers happily said, "We are going to learn from the Red Army during the Long March." Fan Gongwen, the political instructor of a certain battalion, personally went into the river to test the water and was swept to the bottom by the waves. The communicator rescued him. Later, everyone held hands and managed to wade across.
　　As dawn approached, everyone ate some fried beans with cold water, and then began to climb the Daliang Mountains. Here, there was no sign of human habitation, only scorched reeds and gravel everywhere. Yang Taiping, the political instructor of the seventh company, encouraged everyone, "The time to test us has come. True gold is not afraid of fire, and the people's soldiers must withstand the test." The troops marched on narrow and dangerous roads on high and steep mountains. The desire to liberate Xichang supported the soldiers as they dragged their dizzy and sore bodies forward tenaciously. When resting on the steep mountain roads, everyone had to use belts and leggings to tie themselves and their guns to trees, or cling to rocks and grab grass roots to catch their breath.
　　Upon reaching Maopingzi, we set up large pots to cook under the scorching sun, fetching water from the deep mountains fifteen miles away, and drank some thin porridge with fried beans. This was the only meal we had from 4:00 AM on the 24th to 2:00 PM on the 25th. After the meal, an emergency order came: "We must reach Xichang tomorrow." Xichang was still two hundred li away. The commanders and fighters had not rested for three nights since crossing the Jinsha River, and had not eaten for three days and two nights. But in order to annihilate the remaining bandits, everyone unanimously said, "We will crawl these last two hundred li if we have to."
　　Under the order of "Keep up, keep up," we reached Dashiban at dawn, and the city of Xichang was in sight. After crossing the Jinsha River, the troops had not rested for six days and six nights, had not eaten for three days and two nights, and had spent one day and one night climbing mountains and wading through rivers, traveling one hundred and sixty li. Thanks to the arduous and tenacious spirit of all the commanders and fighters, we finally successfully completed the thousand-li roundabout maneuver and, together with the northern brotherly troops, liberated Xichang.
　　"Glory belongs to the warriors advancing to the border, and the people will never forget you." All the commanders and fighters kept this encouragement from their superiors in mind at all times, and were determined to resolutely complete the task of wiping out the remaining bandits, consolidating national defense, and defending the border.

　　涉水越岭，解放西昌
    郑大藩
    三月二十二日，由南路挺进的人民解放军某部，从滇东北巧家县渡过金沙江向西昌进军。江水上下翻腾，船随着波浪四五尺地起落着，一会儿没入浪底，看不见船；一会儿又冒在浪头上，像从水里钻出来一样。战士们兴奋地喊着：“跨黄河，渡长江，今日再渡金沙江。”“走老红军光荣的道路。”欢呼掩没了波浪声。下午三点钟过江，走上靠近江边的红土岭时天就黑了。
    红土岭的山峰好像与云天相接连着，深谷悬崖又看不见底。一阵阵疾风从金沙江吹来，吹得山顶上鸡蛋大的碎石直往下滚，打在钢盔上当当地响。不少人的钢盔、背包、棉衣也被刮落江中。警卫连的两个战士也被狂风卷下悬崖。战士们用被子把枪裹起来紧紧缚在背上，前后互相抓住皮带，蹲着一步一步地向下移。下了山是铁索桥，两根大铁链系在两端悬崖上，下面是万丈深谷，踏在上面摇摆不定，每隔五步才能跟上走一个人，战士们谨慎地走到了桥的那一边。
    下了红土岭以后，气候闷热得像火烧一样。走过巧（家）宁（南）险道，又是大山，连羊肠小道也没有了。战士们小心地抓着石缝一步一步往上爬，大家都满身大汗，喘不过气来。爬过了一段石头坡，上边是野火烧过的山，更加难爬了，有的爬上半山又滚落下来。路尽管这样难走，战士们仍争着扛那重九十斤的步兵炮。天黑得看不见路了，一步高一步低，头都震晕了。
    这时，前面传来了“准备脱裤子，涉渡金沙江”的口令，战士们高兴地说：“要学长征时的红军了。”某营教导员范工文亲自下河探水，被浪卷入水底。通讯员把他救了上来。后来，大家手拉着手，才强涉过去。
    天将亮时，大家用凉水吃了些炒豆，又开始向大凉山上爬。在这里，看不到人迹，到处是烧焦了的芦苇和碎石。七连指导员杨太平鼓励大家说：“考验我们的时候到了，真金不怕火烧，人民战士要经得起考验。”部队在又高又陡的山上，走着又窄又险的路。解放西昌的热望，支持着战士们拖着头昏腿酸的身体顽强地前进。在陡削的山路上休息时，大家只得用皮带、用绑腿连人和枪拴在树上，或者攀着石头、抓住草根喘一口气。
    到达茅坪子，在烈日下支起大锅做饭，从十五里路以外的深山中去弄了水来，配着炒豆喝了点稀饭，这是从二十四日清早四时到二十五日下午两点吃到的唯一的一顿饭。吃罢饭，又来了紧急命令：“明天要赶到西昌。”这里离西昌还有二百里路，指战员们过金沙江后已经三夜没有休息了，但为了全歼残匪，大家一致表示：“最后这二百里，爬也要爬到。”
    在“跟紧、跟紧”的口令下，天明时赶到了大石板，西昌城在望了。部队渡过金沙江后，六天六夜没有休息，三天两夜没有吃饭，一天一夜爬山涉水，走了一百六十里。由于全体指战员的艰苦顽强精神，终于胜利完成了千里迂回任务，配合北路兄弟部队解放了西昌。
    “光荣属于向边疆挺进的勇士，人民是永远不会忘记的。”全体指战员时时刻刻地记着上级的这种鼓励，决心坚决地完成肃清残匪，巩固国防，捍卫边疆的任务。（新华社重庆十六日电）
