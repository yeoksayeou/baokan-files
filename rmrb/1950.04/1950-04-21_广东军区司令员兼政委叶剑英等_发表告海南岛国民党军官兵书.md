　　Guangdong Military Region Commander and Political Commissar Ye Jianying, et al.
    Publish Letter to National Party Officers and Soldiers on Hainan Island

    Hainan Island National Party officers and soldiers and all military and government personnel!
    Unknowingly, you listened to the orders and deceptions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and retreated from various parts of the mainland to Hainan Island, thinking that the vast sea could block the offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and relying on the isolated island you could wait for an opportunity to counterattack. However, the development of the facts has completely shattered your illusion.
    Now the powerful forces of the People's Liberation Army have overcome the natural barrier of the ocean, defeated the patrols of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit ships, destroyed the coastal defenses of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and landed victoriously several times in a row. After annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek army's defense forces on several fronts, they joined forces with the local people's armed forces in Qiongya. This unprecedented and heroic action of the People's Liberation Army proves that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's illusion of relying on the ocean to eke out a precarious existence has failed; it also proves once again the extent to which the morale and fighting power of the Chiang army have declined. At the same time, this powerful landing force of the People's Liberation Army can not only greatly strengthen the fighting power of the Qiongya people's armed forces, and give the remnant defeated generals of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits increasingly heavy and destructive blows; on the other hand, it can also freely open any gap from the inside of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' defenses, in order to meet the continued sea landing of our army, so that Hainan Island, like the mainland, can achieve complete liberation.
    Officers and soldiers and military and government personnel of the Kuomintang army, with Hainan Island about to be liberated, in order to reduce national losses and avoid your unnecessary sacrifices, we once again advise you, hoping that you will no longer be deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. You hope that Chiang Kai-shek will counterattack the mainland. Have you forgotten that Chiang Kai-shek's 7.5 million troops were wiped out on the mainland? You fantasize about a third world war. Don't you know the history of the past two world wars? May I ask how many troops the U.S. imperialism sent in the previous two wars, how many battles it fought, and how many military exploits the U.S. army has established? Weren't they all relying on others to do the work, while U.S. imperialism reaped the benefits? But who can act as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism now? Stop dreaming. The facts are already before you. Either be buried with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, or make a living for yourselves. Although the time is a little late, it is not too late to wake up.

    Now, according to the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the gist of the Eight Articles of Agreement by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we hereby announce the following items to you:
    (1) You should immediately stop resisting, stop sabotage, send people to contact our army, and accept our army's reorganization. All those who are willing to implement the above conditions, whether they belong to the central system or the local system, and regardless of whether they are army commanders or commanders down to squad, platoon, company, or battalion level, will be treated equally, accepted, and their lives and property will be guaranteed.
    (2) Those who do not resist or automatically lay down their weapons when our army lands or on the battlefield may also be employed according to their abilities or sent back to their hometowns with severance pay, based on the principle of voluntariness.
    (3) Political, economic, cultural, and educational workers of the original Kuomintang government agencies should immediately be responsible for protecting all archives, property, utensils of the original agencies, factories, warehouses, schools, and groups, to prevent destruction, so that the People's Government can take over. Regardless of senior, middle, or junior staff, our army will adopt a lenient policy and employ or properly resettle them separately. Those who assist in the takeover and make contributions will be given appropriate rewards; those who dare to violate orders and destroy will be severely punished without leniency.
    (4) The township and Bao personnel of the original Kuomintang should immediately stop doing evil and oppressing the people, and refuse to carry out any orders of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government. When our People's Liberation Army arrives in the local area, they should maintain local order and assist our army in raising grain and handling errands under the guidance of our army. Those who make contributions will be rewarded, and those who commit crimes will be punished.

    This is a notice.
    Commander and Political Commissar of the Guangdong Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Ye Jianying
          Deputy Commander: Deng Hua
        Deputy Political Commissar: Lai Chuanzhu

　　广东军区司令员兼政委叶剑英等
    发表告海南岛国民党军官兵书
    【新华社广州二十日电】中国人民解放军广东军区司令员兼政治委员叶剑英、副司令员邓华、副政治委员赖传珠，于四月十六日发表告海南岛国民党军官兵书，全文如下：
    海南岛国民党军官兵及所有军政人员们！
    你们不自觉地听了蒋匪的命令和欺骗，从各处的大陆撤到海南岛上，以为茫茫大海可以阻挡住人民解放军的攻势，依靠孤岛可以等待什么反攻的时机。可是，事实的发展已完全把你们的这种幻想打破了。
    现在人民解放军有力部队，已经战胜了天险海洋的阻隔，打败了蒋匪舰艇的巡逻，摧毁了蒋匪沿海的守备，连续数次胜利登陆，并于消灭蒋匪军几线的拦阻部队之后，和琼崖本地的人民武装相会合了。人民解放军这一空前而英勇的行动，证明蒋介石匪帮们依靠海洋苟延残喘的幻想是落空了；也再一次证明蒋军的士气、蒋军的战斗力，已经低落到什么程度。同时，人民解放军这一支有力的登陆部队，不仅可以大大加强琼崖人民武装的作战力量，给蒋匪的残兵败将以愈来愈重的毁灭性的打击；另方面，又可以从蒋匪的防御内部，自由地打开任何一个缺口，以接应我大军的继续渡海登陆，使海南岛也像大陆一样，获得完全的解放。
    国民党军的官兵及军政人员们，在海南岛即将解放的情况下，我们为了减少国家的损失，避免你们无谓的牺牲，特再一次劝告你们，希望你们不要再受蒋介石匪帮的欺骗了。你们希望蒋介石向大陆反攻，难道你们忘记了蒋介石的七百五十万军队正是在大陆上被歼灭殆尽的吗？你们幻想第三次世界大战，难道你们不知道过去二次世界大战的历史吗？试问美帝国主义在上二次的战争中出过多少兵，打过多少仗，美国军队曾建过几次战功？还不都是靠旁人出力，而美帝国主义则坐享其成的吗？可是，现在谁能来充当美帝国主义的炮灰呢？你们再也不要做梦了。事实已摆在你们面前，或者是替蒋匪殉葬，或者是为自己谋生，时机虽稍有过迟，觉悟仍犹未为晚。
    兹根据人民政协共同纲领及毛主席、朱总司令约法八章之旨，特为你们宣告如下数项：
    （一）应立即停止抵抗，停止破坏，派人与我军联络，接受我军改编。凡愿执行上述条件者，不论属于中央系统或地方系统，也不论上至军长司令、下至班排连营，均一视同仁，予以接纳，并保障其官兵生命财产的安全。
    （二）凡于我军登陆时或在战场上不加抵抗、自动放下武器者，亦可本自愿原则，分别量才录用或资遣回籍。
    （三）原国民党政府机关的政治、经济、文化、教育工作人员，应立即负责保护原有机关、工厂、仓库、学校、团体的一切档案、财产、用具，防止破坏，以便人民政府接收。无论高级、中级、下级职员，本军均本宽大政策，分别予以录用或作适当安置。其协助接收有功者，当给以适当奖励；其胆敢违令破坏者，定予严惩不贷。
    （四）原国民党之乡保人员应即停止为非作恶及欺压人民的行为，拒绝执行蒋匪政府的任何命令。当我人民解放军到达本地时，应即在我军指示下，维持地方秩序，协助我军筹粮办差。其有功者赏，有罪者罚。
    此告。中国人民解放军广东军区司令员兼政治委员  叶剑英
          副司令员  邓华
        副政治委员  赖传珠
            四月十六日
