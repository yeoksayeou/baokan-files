Xinhua News Agency, April 8th—As the U.S. Congress is about to discuss the 1951 military appropriations, American warmongers are artificially creating a war atmosphere in order to achieve their goal of increasing military spending. A Washington dispatch from Electric News Agency on March 27th cited the U.S. "Newsweek" as saying: U.S. military leaders are "planning to increase the already huge military spending." The designers of Defense Secretary Johnson have determined that the "minimum necessary number" for direct military spending in the next fiscal year is $14 billion. This figure is more than $450 million higher than what Truman proposed in January of this year. According to an Associated Press report, Vincent, chairman of the House Military Committee, also strongly advocated for immediately strengthening the air force on the 4th, and demanded that Congress increase more than $580 million to purchase more aircraft.
　　
In order to achieve this goal of increasing military spending, American warmongers have recently released ghost stories about "unidentified submarines" being discovered off the coast of California and "flying saucers" being discovered in the U.S. skies. According to Agence France-Presse, citing a Moscow radio commentary on April 1st: The news of the so-called "secret submarine" is "coincidentally taking place at the same time as the debate on the military appropriations bill and the 'political campaign' by American imperialists aimed at increasing military spending" and is by no means accidental. As early as 1948, the U.S. Navy authorities fabricated the ghost story of "unidentified submarines" to "intimidate the Congress, which happened to be reviewing the new military expenditures at the time."

### 美国战争贩子叫嚣增加军费

　　美国战争贩子叫嚣增加军费
    【新华社八日讯】在美国国会即将讨论一九五一年度军事拨款前夕，美国战争贩子为了达到增加军费的目的，又在人为地制造战争空气。电通社三月二十七日华盛顿电即曾引美国《新闻周刊》载称：美国军事首脑们正在“计划增加业已很庞大的军费”。国防部长詹逊的设计者，已确定下年度的直接军费“最低限度必需数目为一百四十亿美元”。这个数字较杜鲁门今年一月提出的多了四亿五千万美元以上。据美联社讯，众院军事委员会主席文森四日也力主立即加强空军，要求国会增加五亿八千余万美元购备更多飞机。
    美国战争贩子为了达到这一增加军费的目的，最近又放出在加利福尼亚海岸发现“国籍不明潜艇”以及美国上空发现“飞碟”的鬼话。据法新社引莫斯科电台四月一日评论称：所谓“秘密潜艇”的消息，又一次与军事拨款法案的辩论及美帝国主义分子旨在增加军费的“政治运动同时进行”，绝不是偶然的。早在一九四八年，美海军当局就曾制造“不明潜艇”的鬼话，“恐吓当时偏巧在审查新军费的国会”。
