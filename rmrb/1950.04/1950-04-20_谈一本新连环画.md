　　Talking About a New Comic Book
　　Shi Yi
    The problem of reforming comic strip books has already attracted the attention of many people. The publication of new comic books is gradually developing in quantity. It is gratifying that new literary and art workers are enthusiastically learning this new form of mass literature and art in order to meet the requirements of today's mass cultural life. In this short article, I would like to talk specifically about a new comic book, from which to touch on a basic problem in the work of reforming comic books.

    The new comic book I want to talk about is "The 25,000 Mile Long March," which is one of the "New Era Comic Books" compiled and drawn by Huang Yide and Chen Jiangfeng and published by the East China Bookstore in Shanghai. First of all, starting from the formal aspects, the new comic books published by the East China Bookstore have many formal characteristics: large format, clear pictures, prominent characters, and simple explanatory text, all of which are good. At the same time, it also has the common shortcomings of general new comic books: few panels, weak coherence, and tending to be illustrative; it lacks the detailed description and close connection of the specific process of scenes and character actions in the old comic books, so that people with little literacy can understand the outline and progress of the story without completely relying on text. I think this feature of the old form is important. This is one of the main features of the comic book form that combines old-fashioned embroidered novels and modern film techniques. It can be loved by the vast number of children and working people, and this feature is one of the main reasons.

    Of course, our reform work is more importantly focused on the content. General new comic books have adopted new themes, especially adapting many major literary and artistic works from the old liberated areas, reflecting the life and struggle of the working people in the great people's revolution, which has great educational significance. However, today's literary and art workers in the newly liberated big cities are mostly not familiar enough with the lives of the working people, and their experience in revolutionary struggles is not deep enough. Therefore, when absorbing these themes, they lack the strength to deal with these themes and how to grasp the theme from the principles of political thought. In particular, some literary and art workers engaged in popular forms of literature and art still retain a somewhat frivolous concept of popular work in their minds, which leads to a rough and perfunctory style in their work, lacking the spirit of careful study, and causing many important shortcomings and errors.

    The 25,000-mile Long March is a major historical event in the Chinese people's revolution. The Chinese Communist Party and the revolution it led experienced a severe historical test in this great struggle and finally achieved victory, laying the foundation for today's people's victory. Our literary and art workers should treat this historical event with a rigorous attitude and respect and love for the revolutionary predecessors. Such a serious theme in artistic creation cannot be treated lightly in popular literature and art.

    However, our new comic book workers face this solemn historical fact of the revolution with a frivolous and careless attitude. First of all, the author's attitude towards dealing with this theme is completely indifferent and objectivist. Based on some fragmentary records, they basically do not recognize the important significance of the Long March in the history of the revolution. What exactly do they—the editors and illustrators—want to educate the masses about by using images in the text, even their own concepts are vague. The book flatly lists some events and some superficial phenomena of the Long March. What kind of theme to create cannot be seen in either the pictures or the text.

    Readers cannot see from this comic book that the Red Army is an army of the people, trained from the struggle of the workers and peasants in the land revolution. How did it launch the Long March for the purpose of uniting a broader mass of the people to start the War of Resistance Against Japan in the face of the brutal encirclement and suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by international imperialism, and the intensified aggression of Japanese imperialists. The editors and illustrators seem to be emphasizing the arduous and heroic side of the Long March, but without clearly pointing out the basic meaning of the class struggle of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the general hardship and heroism become meaningless. In the text and pictures, we only see an army advancing, experiencing countless interceptions and obstacles, and finally overcoming them one by one. We can also encounter such scenes in the imperialist colonial war of aggression, which is not the essential meaning of the Long March.

    Secondly, the author's position is completely unstable. They certainly described the heroic Red Army, but they also emphasized the "heroic" of the White Army. On page six, the enemy guarding the Wujiang River, on page nineteen, the enemy at the Jinsha River, and on page twenty-one, the image of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit leader, are all painted very "solemnly." From this, we cannot see the author's attitude of hatred towards them. In the scenes of the enemy facing each other, such as the night attack after crossing the Wujiang River on page ten, the White bandit guards on the opposite bank of the Dadu River on page thirty, the charge at Lazikou on page fifty-five, and the scene of rushing to kill the enemy on page fifty-eight, all emphasize the bandit army side in the picture. This imbalance in the picture configuration and the shift in perspective reveals the author's subconscious attitude of detachment.

    The Long March overcame all difficulties and achieved the final victory, also because the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was a team that closely contacted the masses. Precisely because it relied closely on the masses, the Long March was able to achieve such a brilliant victory. However, in the comic book, we cannot see a single member of the people on the journey. We only see "caught a ferry..." (page twenty-eight), "and caught three more boats..." (page thirty-three), "later caught a few barbarians as guides..." (page fifty-three), it seems that all the way only forcibly commands the use of the power of the people, and is not a team of the people with three major disciplines and eight points for attention.

    The treatment of ethnic minorities in the comic book is completely a sneak attack on the American movie "Wilderness Adventure" image. The image of the Lolo ethnic group (pages twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five), except for a piece of cloth on the head, completely copies the imperialist artists' views on African nationalities, and the "barbarians" on the Songpan prairie (pages forty-nine, fifty-three) have become South American Red Indians. Dealing with things that one is not familiar with based on subjective self-righteousness is not at all an attitude of engaging in serious literary and artistic work and being responsible to readers, and adopting such an image in fact exists the author's Han chauvinism and the idea of ​​despising ethnic minorities.

    In the Long March of the comic book, it is also impossible to understand the power of the Party's political leadership. Only three places mention the Communist Party members. On page seven, eighteen Communist Party members signed up to cross the river. On page twenty-eight, sixteen Communist Party members jumped into the boat. On page thirty, thirty Communist Party members climbed the iron rope to climb the bridge. However, how the Party's leadership grasped this Long March team is not within the vision of our author. The author's vision only sees "wonderful method" (page fourteen), "deception" (page fifteen), "impersonation" (page sixteen), and so on.

    The above only said a few major shortcomings and errors, and there are still many other unreasonable and redundant chapters, such as in the melee between the enemy and us, enemy planes are still dropping bombs (page four), and the big radish picked from the barbarian field on page fifty-one has purely become a kind of exotic significance, etc.

    In short, I think that the comic book "The 25,000 Mile Long March" has great shortcomings and errors in the handling of the theme and the grasp of the theme. The same shortcomings and errors also partially or more or less exist in some new comic books, thus reducing the due educational significance, or even playing a distorted and harmful role. I only cited one "The 25,000 Mile Long March" because we have to demand higher political and ideological cultivation and a more serious attitude towards such themes. Reforming comic books is still a new job today. We demand the development of quantity as urgently as the improvement of quality, but we cannot therefore allow the existence of frivolous and careless phenomena.

　　谈一本新连环画
    适夷
    连环图画的改造问题，已经引起了很多人的注意。新连环画的出版，数量正在逐渐的发展。为着适应今天群众文化生活的要求，新的文艺工作者热心的学习群众文艺的这个新的形式，是可喜的现象。在这篇短文中，我想具体的谈到一本新连环画，从这儿来接触改造连环画工作中一个基本的问题。
    我要谈到的一本新连环画是“二万五千里长征”，这是由黄一德、陈江风编绘，上海华东书店出版的“新时代连环画”中的一本。首先从形式方面谈起，华东书店出版的新连环画，有许多形式上的特点；开本大，画面明朗，人物突出，说明文字简单，这些都是好的一面。同时也具有一般新连环画共同的缺点，画幅少，连贯性不强，流于插图式；没有旧连环画那种把场面、人物行动的具体过程作细致的描写和密切的连系，使识字不多的人不必完全依靠文字就能够理解故事的轮廓和进程的特征。我以为旧形式的这一个特征是重要的，这是把旧有的绣像小说和近代电影手法结合起来的连环画形式的主要特征之一，它能受广大儿童和劳动人民的喜爱，这个特征是主要的原因之一。
    当然，我们的改造工作，更重要的是在于内容方面的改造，一般新连环画都采取了新的题材，特别是改编了老解放区的许多主要的文艺作品，反映了劳动人民在伟大的人民革命中的生活和斗争，有很大的教育意义。但今天新经解放的大城市中的文艺工作者，大都对劳动人民的生活还不够熟悉，在革命斗争中的体验也不深入，因此在吸取这些题材的时候，对于如何处理这些题材，如何从政治的思想的原则上来掌握主题，就显得没有力量，特别是有些从事通俗形式的文艺工作者，思想上还多少保留对通俗工作的轻率的观念，便形成在工作上的粗糙潦草的作风，缺乏细心钻研的精神，造成了许多重要的缺点和错误。
    二万五千里长征是中国人民革命中一个重大的史实，中国共产党和它所领导的革命，在这一个伟大斗争中经历了严重的历史的考验而终于获得胜利，奠定了今天人民胜利的基础。我们文艺工作者应该以谨严的态度，和对革命前辈的尊敬和热爱，来处理这个历史的事迹。在艺术创作上这样严肃的一个题材，在通俗文艺中也不是可以轻率地处理的。
    但是我们新连环画的工作者却以一种轻浮草率的态度来面对这个革命的庄严的史实。首先作者处理这个题材的态度，完全是冷淡的，客观主义的，凭着一些片段的记载，对于长征在革命史上的重大的意义，是基本上没有认识的。他们——编者和绘者要把这个史迹通过图文形象来教育广大群众，究竟要教育一些什么，连自己的观念也是模糊的。书中平铺直叙的罗列了长征中的一些事迹，一些表面的现象，究竟要创造出一个怎样的主题，在无论图画和文字中，是完全看不出来的。
    读者在这本连环画中，没有方法看出红军是中国工农群众在土地革命的斗争中锻炼出来的一支人民自己的军队，它怎样在国际帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮的残酷围剿，和日本帝国主义者加紧侵略的形势中，为着团结更广大的人民发动抗日战争而出发了长征。编绘者似乎在强调长征的艰苦和英勇的一面，但是不把工农红军的阶级斗争的基本意义明白提示出来，一般的艰苦和英勇便成为没有意义的东西。我们在图文中只看见一支军队在前进，经历了无数的拦击，险阻，而终于一一把它克服了。这样的场面，我们在帝国主义的殖民地侵略战中也可以遇到，并不是长征的本质的意义。
    其次，作者的立场是完全不稳定的，他们固然描写了英勇的红军，但是也同样强调了白军的“英伟”，第六页把守乌江的敌军，第十九页金沙江边的敌军，第二十一页蒋介石匪首的形象，都画得非常“庄严”，从这儿看不出作者对他们的憎恨的态度。在敌我对面的场面，如第十页渡乌江后的夜袭，第三十页大渡河对岸白匪的守军，第五十五页腊子口的冲锋，第五十八页冲杀敌军的场面，在画面上都强调匪军的一面。这种画面配备的不称，和视角的转移，显出了作者潜意识中的超然物外的态度。
    长征克服一切的困难，获得最后的胜利，也同时因为工农红军是一支密切联系群众的队伍，正因为紧紧的依靠着群众，所以长征能获得这样辉煌的胜利。但是在连环画中我们是看不到征途中的一个人民群众的，我们只看到“捉到一只渡船……”（第二十八页）“又捉到三只船……”（第三十三页）“后来捉了几个蛮人做向导……”（第五十三页），似乎一路上只以强迫命令使用人民的力量，并不是一支有三大纪律、八项注意的人民的队伍。
    连环画中对少数民族的处理，完全是偷袭了美国电影的“蛮荒探险”式的形象。倮倮族的形象（第二十三、二十四、二十五页）除了头上一块布完全照抄了帝国主义艺术家对菲洲民族的看法，松潘草原的“蛮人”（第四十九页，五十三页），变成了南美洲的红印地安人。对于自己所不熟悉的事物，凭着主观自以为是的处理，完全不是从事严肃文艺工作，对读者负责的态度，而且采用这样的形象，事实上是存在着作者的大民族主义，轻蔑少数民族的思想。
    在连环画的长征中，也无法了解党的政治领导的力量，只有三处写到了共产党员，第七页十八个共产党员报名渡江，第二十八页十六个共产党员跳下船去，第三十页三十个共产党员攀铁索爬桥，但是党的领导怎样掌握这一支长征的队伍，却是不在我们作者的视野里边的。作者的视野中只看见“妙法”（第十四页），“骗”（第十五页），“冒充”（第十六页）等等。
    以上只说了几处主要的缺点和错误，其他不合理的，多余的篇幅还有不少，如在敌我肉搏中，敌机还在投弹（第四页），又如在第五十一页画面上从蛮人田里摘来的大萝卜，纯粹变成一种猎奇的意义等等。
    总之，我以为连环画“二万五千里长征”在题材的处理和主题的掌握上存在很大缺点和错误，同样的缺点和错误也局部地或多或少地存在一部分新的连环画中，因此减少了应有的教育意义，或甚至起了歪曲的有害的作用。我单单举出一本“二万五千里长征”，因为我们对这样的题材不得不要求更高的政治、思想的修养和更严肃的态度。改造连环画今天还是一种新的工作，我们与质的提高同样迫切地要求量的发展，但是不能因此就允许轻浮、草率的现象存在。
