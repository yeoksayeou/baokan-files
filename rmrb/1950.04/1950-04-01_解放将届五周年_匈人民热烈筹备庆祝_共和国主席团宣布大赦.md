　　Liberation Approaching Fifth Anniversary
    Hungarian People Enthusiastically Preparing for Celebration
    Republic's Presidium Announces Amnesty
    [Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 31st] TASS, Budapest: The Hungarian working people are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Hungary on April 4th. The celebration will be held for three days starting on April 2nd, and a grand review and demonstration parade will be held on April 4th, followed by a mass celebration rally.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 31st] TASS, Budapest: On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic has passed a resolution announcing an amnesty. The amnesty applies to a number of people who have been convicted of political, economic and other crimes. The amnesty also applies to Hungarian expatriates overseas, and especially to those who have been ordered to leave Hungary or who have been subjected to fascist deceptive propaganda. Hungarian citizens who went to the West as a result of military operations may return to Hungary before October 4, 1950, without being prosecuted. The amnesty also applies to those citizens who illegally left Hungary after liberation under the influence of enemy propaganda, but who now understand that happiness can only be found among the working people of Hungary and are willing to return home.

　　解放将届五周年
    匈人民热烈筹备庆祝
    共和国主席团宣布大赦
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民热烈筹备庆祝四月四日苏军解放匈牙利五周年。庆祝自四月二日起举行三天，四月四日将举行盛大检阅和示威游行，随后并将举行群众欢庆大会。
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：值此匈牙利解放五周年之际，匈牙利人民共和国主席团通过了宣布大赦的决议。大赦适用于若干因政治、经济和其他罪行而被判罪的人们。大赦也适用于匈牙利海外侨民，而且首先是那些被命令离开匈牙利或受到法西斯欺骗宣传的人们。因为军事行动而到西方去的匈牙利公民，可在一九五○年十月四日前返回匈牙利，而不受检举。大赦也适用于那些在解放后在敌人宣传的影响下非法离开匈牙利，但现在已了解只有在匈牙利劳动人民中间才有快乐而愿意回国的公民。
