Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government recently issued a "Directive on Promoting Lending in Rural Disaster Areas." The directive stated: Broadly and correctly developing rural lending in disaster areas is an important way to overcome famine. Although some rural disaster areas have solved many production and living difficulties for disaster victims by implementing correct free lending policies in the past, many areas have experienced biases such as forced lending, hard lending, and exhaustive lending in their lending work. The above biases are extremely harmful to the development of lending relationships and are also detrimental to disaster relief work. To this end, the directive pointed out that in the future, all localities must first correct their lending policies when carrying out lending, as this is an important link in activating free lending in rural disaster areas. The directive stated that lending interest rates should be determined by both parties, but should not be too high. The People's Government must protect new lending relationships established among the masses. Secondly, it is necessary to widely publicize and explain the People's Government's free lending policy, especially to the wealthy, to dispel their various concerns and ensure that loans are repaid with principal and interest. Local People's Governments should issue proclamations promoting legitimate lending. The directive believes that lending and disaster relief work should be discussed in people's representative conferences at all levels and in all other organizations. Upright wealthy people should be absorbed into these meetings to influence the masses with their positive actions. The directive pointed out that lending must be combined with production; otherwise, borrowers will be idle and lenders will be dissatisfied or uneasy. It is even more important to prevent hooligans and bad elements from taking the opportunity to extort food and property, and engage in sabotage activities such as theft and spreading rumors.

    提倡灾区农村借贷  解决灾民生产困难
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府内务部顷发布“关于灾区农村提倡借贷工作”的指示。指示称：广泛而正确地开展灾区农村借贷是渡荒的重要办法。虽然部分灾区农村在过去贯彻正确的自由借贷政策中，已解决了不少灾民的生产和生活困难；但也有不少地区在借贷工作中发生强借、硬借、搜借等偏向。上述偏向对发展借贷关系是有极大妨害的，对救灾工作也是不利的。为此，指示指出：各地今后在开展借贷中首先必须端正借贷政策，因为这是活跃灾区农村自由借贷的重要环节。指示称，借贷利息应由双方自订，但不可过高。人民政府对于群众间成立的新的借贷关系必须加以保护。其次，应广泛地宣传解释人民政府的自由借贷政策，特别对富有者，要解除他们的各种顾虑，保证有借有还、有本有利。各地人民政府要颁布提倡正当借贷布告。指示认为，在各级人民代表会议上及其他一切组织中，应讨论借贷及救灾工作。这些会议中应吸收正派的富有者参加，以他们的积极行动作出典型来影响群众。指示指出借贷必须与生产相结合，否则借者坐吃山空，被借者就会不满或不放心。更应防止二流子和坏分子乘机吓诈粮食财物及偷盗造谣等破坏行为。
