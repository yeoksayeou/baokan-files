　　Seize the Good Opportunity After the Rain
　　Tangshan Region Launches Sowing Campaign
　　Leting and Other Counties Sow 80% of the Fields
　　[Tangshan News] The Tangshan region of Hebei Province is seizing the favorable season after the rain to fully launch a spring plowing and sowing campaign.
　　On the 3rd of this month, the entire region received a thorough rain. In addition to urgently instructing the counties, the Commissioner's Office and the CPC Prefectural Committee sent 86 cadres led by He Bingzhang, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and Ma Li, Commissioner, to the countryside. Each county also organized work teams of 30 to 50 people led by the county party committee secretary and county head to go to the countryside, with spring plowing and sowing as the central task overriding all other work, mobilizing the vast number of farmers, men, women, and children, to launch a concentrated sowing effort. At present, spring plowing and sowing has been fully launched throughout the region. As of the 15th, the region has sown more than 500,000 mu of sorghum, spring millet, corn, etc. Leting, Lulong, Funing and other counties have completed more than 80%. Luan County, Luannan, Fengrun, Qian'an and other counties have completed 50%. Before sowing, all localities paid attention to reserving cotton fields. The Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative have transported 1.7 million jin of cotton seeds to the cotton-producing areas of Lulong, Zunhua, Changli, Funing, Fengnan, Fengrun, Luannan and other counties. Counties, districts, and village cooperatives have also adopted methods such as loans, sales, and exchanges to promptly solve the difficulties faced by farmers lacking cotton seeds, to ensure the realization of cotton planting plans. Cadres in various counties went to the countryside to assist in the work. Leading comrades from Lulong County led 30 cadres to the countryside to mobilize cotton planting. Through representatives meetings, labor model symposiums, small-scale forums, and the mobilization of village cadres and Communist Party members to go door-to-door to extensively promote production policies. This door-to-door propaganda has been very effective. For example, in Chengjiao Village in the Fourth District, after patient explanations by party members and members of the Communist Youth League, all 3,400 mu of land in the village have reserved more than 990 mu for cotton fields, ten times more than last year. A large number of county and district cadres in Fengrun are also conducting in-depth inspections. More than 40,000 mu of cotton fields have been prepared, and more than 1,000 mu have been sown. Farmers in various places are helping each other in sowing. In the sowing of cotton fields and other crops, free combination and mutual assistance in labor exchange are widespread. According to statistics from Lulong, Funing, Leting, and Yutian counties alone, more than 15,800 small mutual aid teams have been organized, with more than 50,000 men and women (women accounting for two-fifths), 5,720 sets of livestock, and 2,852 teams of large hoes. This has solved the difficulties such as the lack of manpower and animal power in spring plowing and sowing. In order to ensure that production and work are not delayed, fifteen village cadres in Niutouya in the Eighth District of Funing formed a production mutual aid team. One person is on duty every day, and all cadres in the team go to the fields to produce. They discuss work during production breaks and solve problems together in the evening. Because the village cadres are actively involved in production, they have driven the entire village to freely combine into 39 mutual aid teams. All 66 mu of land belonging to the families of revolutionary soldiers and workers, except for the cotton fields, peanuts, and yam land, have been sown. In order to promote good cotton and lead farmers in seed soaking, Luannan Farm sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead 4,666 households in spring sowing and seed soaking.
　　Although spring plowing and sowing has been widely launched throughout the region, the following issues should still be vigorously addressed: (1) Some people still have concerns about planting cotton, and the phenomenon of fewer reserved cotton fields should be addressed by the leadership in various localities. (2) A large number of laborers in Fengnan, Fengrun, Zunhua, Yutian, and Qian'an counties have been drawn to dig rivers, and the labor force in the villages has been relatively reduced. Some villages have created the experience of mutual assistance and labor exchange, which should be vigorously promoted. (3) The work of substituting for military families has not been sorted out in some districts and villages, resulting in a serious waste of manpower. The leadership should seriously check and implement the provincial government's measures for substituting for military families, and educate military families to participate in production. (4) Attention should still be paid to solving the difficulties of some households in villages lacking livestock and labor. The leadership has paid attention to the above issues and is working hard to reverse the situation.

　　抓紧雨后好时机
    唐山专区掀起播种运动
    乐亭等县播种大田百分之八十
    【唐山讯】河北唐山专区抓紧雨后有利季节，全力突击展开春耕春种运动。
    本月三日全区落了透雨，专署与中共地委除紧急指示各县外，并由地委书记贺秉章、专员马力等率领八十六名干部下乡。各县均先后组织三五十人工作队由县委、县长带领下乡，以春耕春种为压倒一切工作的中心工作，发动广大农民男女老幼突击播种。目前全区各地春耕播种已全面展开，截至十五日，全区已播种高粱、春谷、玉黍等已达五十余万亩。乐亭、芦龙、抚宁等县已完成百分之八十以上。滦县、滦南、丰润、迁安等县，已完成百分之五十。在播种前，各地注意了留棉田。专署与专区供销总社已将一百七十万斤棉籽运往棉产区——芦龙、遵化、昌黎、抚宁、丰南、丰润、滦南等县。各县、区、村社并采取了贷、卖、换等方式，及时解决了农民缺棉种困难。为保证种棉计划实现。各县干部纷纷下乡深入协助工作，芦龙县负责同志率三十名干部下乡突击发动种棉。通过各界代表会、劳动模范座谈会、小型座谈会和发动村干中共党员具体深入到户广泛的宣传生产政策。这种挨门逐户深入的宣传收效很大，如四区城角村，经党员、团员挨门挨户的耐心解释下，全村三千四百多亩地，已留棉田九百九十多亩，比去年多十倍。丰润大批县区干亦深入检查。现已整好棉地四万余亩，下种千余亩，各地农民正在互助播种。在播种棉田与其他作物中，自由结合互助拨工很广泛。仅据芦龙、抚宁、乐亭、玉田等县计已有组织起小型互助组一万五千八百多组，男女达五万余人（妇女占五分之二），牲畜插套五千七百二十犋，大镐队二千八百五十二人。这样解决了春耕春种中人畜力缺乏等困难。抚宁八区牛头崖十五个村干部为了生产工作两不误，组成了生产互助组，每日一人值日工作，全组干部下地生产，生产休息时间讨论工作，晚上集合一起解决。由于村干部生产积极，带动全村自由结合了三十九个互助组。把烈军工属的六十六亩地除留棉田花生山药地外，全部播种完毕。滦南农场为推广良棉与领导农民浸种，派出大批干部下乡领导了四千六百六十六户春种浸了种。
    全区春耕春种虽已普遍展开，但仍应大力解决如下问题：（一）部分群众种棉仍有顾虑，留棉地少现象，各地领导上应引起重视解决。（二）丰南、丰润、遵化、玉田、迁安等县大批劳动力抽出挖河，村中劳动力相对减少，这个矛盾有的村已创造了这一互助拨工经验，应大力推广。（三）代耕工作有的区村尚未整理，浪费民力现象很严重，领导上应认真检查与贯彻省府军属代耕办法，并教育军属参加生产。（四）各村部分缺畜力和劳力户，仍应注意解决其困难。以上几个问题，领导上已引起重视，正大力扭转中。
