    Kolabelnikova's Workday
    Xinhua News Agency and our newspaper's Moscow correspondent Li He
    In the Soviet workers' socialist production competition to greet May Day, Lydia Kolabelnikova created a fresh method of joint savings (i.e., saving) raw materials and supplies throughout the entire production process. On April 1st, major Moscow newspapers – Pravda, Izvestia, Trud, and Komsomolskaya Pravda – all prominently published news about it.

    Kolabelnikova is a female worker at the "Paris Commune" shoe factory in Moscow and a member of the Lenin Communist Youth League. During March, all eighteen groups in the "Parko" workshop where Kolabelnikova worked paid close attention to saving materials. On March 16th, Kolabelnikova and her group suggested: until the last day of March, do not take supplies from the warehouse, but use their own saved materials for production. This moving suggestion was supported by the entire workshop.

    On March 31st, the entire workshop greeted it with joy. The machines were cleaned. A banner was hung across the entrance of the workshop with the words "Today the entire 'Parko' workshop is working with saved materials." The warehouse was open as usual, but no group went to it to collect new materials. Manufacturing leather shoes usually requires forty-two kinds of materials besides leather. However, Kolabelnikova and her comrades already knew: since the beginning of March, they had saved forty kilograms of solvent, nine hundred and two kilograms of glue, nine hundred spools of thread, and other raw materials and supplies sufficient for twenty-four hours. At seven o'clock in the morning, the machines started. The conveyor belt transported a steady stream of newly produced children's leather shoes and ankle boots of various colors: black, blue, yellow, brown... There were new achievements every hour. Each group competed to exceed the production target. Kolabelnikova's group was the first to exceed the plan, making seven hundred and thirty pairs of leather shoes in eight hours, while the original plan only required six hundred and sixty-three pairs. The entire workshop, working in two shifts, used materials saved in one month to manufacture four thousand and three hundred pairs of leather shoes, of which ninety-four percent were of first-class quality.

    After work, Kolabelnikova said: "Joint savings requires a high degree of accuracy from every worker in their work. This means not only the growth of the technical culture of individual Stakhanovites, but also the growth of the technical culture of the entire workshop and the entire factory. Joint savings – this is a higher level of worker technology, this is an improvement of the technical standards of Stakhanovites. Joint savings is fundamentally different from simple reduction; it requires new technical creations."

    The entire "Paris Commune" factory decided: before May Day, they will use materials saved by the joint savings method to produce 60,000 pairs of leather shoes beyond the plan. On April 30th, the entire factory will work for one day with materials saved in April. According to news on April 1st and 2nd, workers, engineers, and technicians at the Kiev First Shoe Factory, Almaty First Shoe Factory, Woolen Textile Factory, Tbilisi Stalin Shoe Factory, Sukhumi Leather and Shoe Integrated Factory, and Stalingrad Red October Metallurgical Factory have achieved significant results by responding to and adopting the proposal of joint savings of raw materials and supplies put forward by Kolabelnikova, a female worker at the "Paris Commune" factory, and Kuznetsov, a worker at another factory. Kolabelnikova's workday and saving methods are being promoted. Please read her diary published in Komsomolskaya Pravda:

    March 16th Our whole group welcomes this proposal: to set aside one day in a month to work with accumulated materials. The young women said confidently at the production meeting today: we can do it. Really, some incidental materials we have not saved enough. So Ren Niang·Duodolieva is right: many people should think more about saving, because, for example, without yarn, there is no such thing as joint savings.

    We call on all groups in our workshop to participate in the competition.

    March 17th Just came back from the Party District Committee. It turns out that they already knew about our proposal. The factory director and workshop director talked to the District Committee about our affairs. The comrades thanked us for our good start and supported us. Now we have to do as we said.

    March 19th Day off. Visited friends. When I got home, my relatives happily told me: Lydia, the radio just broadcast your story. They couldn't believe it at first. I talked about everything that has happened these days. My relatives said I was great and set a good example. I want to go to the workshop to work quickly, work!

    March 20th We have never worked like this before. We take less incidental materials and supplies from the warehouse than stipulated; many people have enough, and others even have surplus, we are saving. I am happy for Danya·Yalduinina and Varya·Stiebiechieva. They set a good example. Today the group sent seven hundred pairs of shoes from the conveyor belt. We did not lower the quality.

    Yesterday at the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. We received a warm reception here. I was awarded a certificate of honor.

    March 22nd Today we calculated what materials and how many we have accumulated. We accumulate more materials day by day. We save casein glue when putting on the shoe heels; save solvent when putting on the shoe tips; save thread, soap, and oil when sewing; save iron wire when nailing the shoe insoles; save rubber glue when gluing the shoe insoles; save yarn, needles, and resin wax when putting on the shoe soles. However, we save some materials less.

    March 25th Telephoned Minsk shoe workers from the Central Telegraph Office. Talked about our work experience and agreed on a competition with Minsk shoe workers Filipovich and Gostrilicha.

    March 27th Read aloud the letters I received these days in the group. Dear unknown friends, thank you for your kind words and good intentions.

    Attended the Ministry meeting. A little nervous. Because the Minister of Light Industry, well-known staff, and experts are listening to me. As I spoke, my eyes saw the workshop and partners. I thought, how much labor is cherished in our country. Minister Gao Xijin said: Kolabelnikova and Kuznetsov from another factory's proposal should be supported and promoted as much as possible. The Minister pointed out: when we save materials, we should never forget quality. How can we not!

    March 28th March 31st is coming soon, the day we will only work with saved materials. So today we checked again how much we have saved. All enough for the whole class to use. I paid attention to what Anna·Kobaeva's repair department is doing. They are all young women, accumulating so much wax, nails, sandpaper, gasoline, glue, and materials for repairing shoes, enough for the whole working day. Their group will also work with saved materials on March 31st. And not just our two groups - the entire workshop!

    March 30th Shoe workers from Leningrad and Tbilisi came to our workshop to learn about the experience of joint savings. I am very happy that not only light industry people are learning from our example. Train drivers use accumulated coal to drive, and metallurgical workers, machine manufacturing workers, and machine tool manufacturing workers will take one or two days a month to work with accumulated materials.

    Tomorrow we will have a big holiday. We will complete the tasks we bear. Every pair of shoes we produce tomorrow will be made of saved materials and incidental materials.

Moscow, April 2

    柯拉别尔尼科娃的工作日
    新华社及本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    在苏联工人迎接五一节的社会主义生产竞赛中，李基雅·柯拉别尔尼科娃创造了联合节约（即在整个生产过程中节约）原料和材料的新鲜方法。四月一日，莫斯科各大报——真理报、消息报、劳动报、青年团真理报都以显著地位刊载了有关的新闻。
    柯拉别尔尼科娃是莫斯科“巴黎公社”造鞋工厂的女工，列宁共产主义青年团团员。三月份中，柯拉别尔尼科娃所工作的“帕尔科”车间全部十八个组都很注意节约材料。柯拉别尔尼科娃和她那一组在三月十六日建议：到三月份的最后一天，不要库房的供给，用自己节省下的材料来生产。这一动人的建议，获得了全车间的支持。
    三月三十一日，全车间兴高采烈地迎接它。机器擦洗过了。车间门口横挂着“今天全‘帕尔科’车间用节省下的材料工作”的标语。库房照常开放着，但是没有一个组向它领新材料。向来制造皮鞋，除了皮以外，还需要四十二种材料。可是柯拉别尔尼科娃和她的同伴们已经胸中有数：从三月初起，她们已经节省下了四十公斤溶化剂、九百零二公斤胶、九百轴线，和其他足够二十四小时用的原料和材料。上午七点钟，机器开动了。输送带川流不息地运送新出产的各色儿童皮鞋和短靴：黑的、蓝的、黄的、褐的……。每一钟头，都有新的成绩。每组都争着要超过生产任务。柯拉别尔尼科娃组最先超过计划，在八个钟头中，制好七百三十双皮鞋，而原定计划只要求六百六十三双。分成两班工作的全车间，用一个月节省下的材料，制造了四千三百双皮鞋，其中百分之九十四，质量都是头等的。
    柯拉别尔尼科娃下班后说：“联合节约，要求每个工人在工作中的高度精确性。这意味着，不但个别的斯达哈诺夫者的技术文化的增长，而且车间全体和整个工厂的技术文化的增长。联合节约——这是更高的工人技术水平，这是斯达哈诺夫者技术标准的增进。联合节约，和简单的精减截然不同，它要求技术上的新创造。”
    “巴黎公社”工厂全体决定：到五一节前，要用联合节约方法省下的材料，超出计划地出产六万双皮鞋。四月三十日，全厂将以四月份节省下的材料工作一天。据四月一、二日消息，基也辅第一鞋厂，阿尔木图第一鞋厂、呢绒制造厂，梯比里斯斯大林鞋厂、苏胡木斯克制革造鞋联合工厂，斯大林格勒红色十月冶金工厂的工人、工程师、技师都因为响应了和采取了“巴黎公社”工厂女工柯拉别尔尼科娃和另一工厂工人库兹涅佐夫所提的联合节约原料和材料的建议，而获得显著的成绩。柯拉别尔尼科娃的工作日和节约方法，正被推广着。请读青年团真理报发表的她的日记：
    三月十六日  我们全组都欢迎这个建议：一月中拿出一天用积蓄的材料来工作。女青年们今天在生产会议上满怀信心地说：这，我们做得到。真的，有些附带材料，我们节约得还不够。所以任娘·杜多列瓦说得对：许多人应当更多地考虑节约的事，因为，比方说，没有纱，就谈不上什么联合节约。
    我们号召我们车间所有的组参加竞赛。
    三月十七日  刚刚从党的区委会回来。原来他们那里已经知道我们的建议，同厂长、车间长跟区委会谈了我们的事情。同志们感谢我们的好开头，并且支持我们。现在就是要做的像说的一样。
    三月十九日  休息日。到朋友那里做客。回家来，亲戚们高兴地告诉我：李基雅，广播刚才播送了你的事。他们一下子不敢相信。我谈了这些日子所有的事情。亲戚们说我好样，说我作了模范。想赶快到车间去工作，工作！
    三月二十日  我们从来也没有这样的工作过。我们从库房拿出比规定更少的附带材料和材料；许多人已经够用了，其他的人甚至还有剩余，我们节省着。我为丹娘·亚尔杜宁娜和瓦里雅·斯铁比契娃高兴。他们作了模范。今天组里从输送带送出了七百双皮鞋。我们没有降低质量。
    昨天在青年团中央委员会。我们在这里受到温暖的接待。我被授给荣誉状。
    三月二十二日  今天计算了积蓄了什么材料，多少数量。我们积累起一天比一天多的材料。我们在上鞋后跟的时候，节省着酪素胶（Casein glue）；在上鞋尖的时候，节省着溶化剂，在行缝的时候，节省着线、肥皂、油；在钉鞋里底的时候，节省着铁丝；在粘鞋底里的时候，节省着橡皮胶；在上鞋底的时候，节省着纱、针、树脂腊。然而有些材料我们节省得还少。
    三月二十五日  从中央电报局同明斯克鞋工通电话。谈了我们工作的经验，同明斯克鞋工菲立波维和高斯特立查两同志讲妥了关于竞赛的事。
    三月二十七日  在组里念了这些天来我收到的信。亲爱的不认识的朋友们，谢谢你们的挚辞和好意。
    出席部会。有点慌张。因为轻工业部部长、出名的工作人员、专家听我说话。我说着，我的眼睛前现着车间、伙伴。我想，劳动在我们国内多么受珍重。部长高惜今同志说：柯拉别尔尼科娃和另一工厂的库兹涅佐夫的建议，应该尽量地支持和推广。部长指出：我们在节约材料时，应当永远不忘质量。怎能不这样！
    三月二十八日  三月三十一日快到了，这一天我们将只用节省下的材料工作。所以今天再检查一次积蓄了多少。全部足够全班需用。我注意安娜·科巴列娃修饰部门做的事情。她们都是女青年，积蓄那么多的腊、钉子、砂纸、汽油、胶、修饰鞋的材料，足够全工作日之用。她们的组，也要在三月三十一日，用节省下的材料工作。而且不只我们两组——整个车间呵！
    三月三十日  列宁格勒、梯比里斯的鞋工到了我们车间、来了解联合节约的经验。我很愉快，不仅轻工业人们学法我们的榜样。火车司机用积蓄的煤来驾驶，冶金工人、机器制造工人、母机制造工人都要一个月拿一两天用积蓄的材料工作。
    明天我们要过大节日。我们要完成所负担的任务。明天我们出产的每一双鞋，都是用节省下的材料和附带材料制造的。
                                                  莫斯科  四月二日
