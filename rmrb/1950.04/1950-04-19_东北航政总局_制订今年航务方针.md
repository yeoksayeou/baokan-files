Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. The Northeast Navigation Administration Bureau has formulated the guiding principles and tasks for navigation work in Northeast China in 1950, deciding that this year's navigation work will mainly focus on strengthening navigation administration and unifying navigation management. Specific tasks include the continued construction of ports and docks by various bureaus, with emphasis on certain areas, as well as the construction of ships, shortening berthing times, improving ship turnover rates, and strengthening transportation capacity; taking state-owned transportation as the backbone, cooperating with private transportation, encouraging private investment, and strengthening the management of private transportation. In terms of business, a policy of small profits and large volumes will be adopted to actively develop cargo sources and organize large-scale freight transportation. It is estimated that the total transportation volume in 1950 will increase by 58% compared to last year.

Last year's navigation construction by the Bureau achieved great success. A total of 600,820 tons of cargo were transported throughout the year. Among them, civil aviation transportation accounted for more than 48% of the total transportation volume. The Yingkou, Andong, and Harbin bureaus have also rebuilt various navigation markers, dykes, bank protection, ports, and docks along the routes. In addition, the Bureau built nine ships, twenty-four tugboats, and改造three motorized junks throughout the year.

    制订今年航务方针
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北航政总局制订了一九五○年东北航务工作方针及任务，决定今年航务工作主要是加强航政建设，统一航政管理。具体任务除各局继续有重点地进行修建港口码头等工程外，并进行修建船只，缩短停舶时间，提高船舶周转率，加强运输力量；以国营运输业为骨干，与民间运输业合作，鼓励私人投资，加强对私营运输业的管理等工作。在业务上则采取薄利多运政策，积极开辟货源，大量组织货运。预计一九五○年全年运输总量将较去年提高百分之五十八。
    该局去年的航政建设，曾获得很大成绩。总计去年全年共运输货物六十万零八千二百余吨。其中组织民航运输者占运输总量的百分之四十八强。营口、安东、哈尔滨三局并重新修建了航路中各种识标及护堤、护岸、港口、码头等。此外，该局全年还修造了轮船九只、拖船二十四只及改造了机帆船三只。
