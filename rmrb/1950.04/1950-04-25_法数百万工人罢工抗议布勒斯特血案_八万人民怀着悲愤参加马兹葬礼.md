　　Xinhua News Agency, April 24th News, TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda*'s Paris special correspondent Zhukov reports: The news of the shooting of workers' demonstration ranks in Brest has aroused stormy repercussions in every region of France. On the night of the 19th, when the coffin of worker Mazé, who was killed by the police, was buried, millions of French workers responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and began a strike to protest the ruling authorities' implementation of police suppression and demand the dissolution of the so-called "Republican Security Force."
　　The people's anger is so high that the authorities dare not stop the workers' demonstrations. A general strike has been launched in Brest, and all factories, transportation, and public institutions have come to a standstill. Shops are closed, and the entire port is lifeless. Thousands of people traveled on foot or by train from all over the Brittany Peninsula to attend Mazé's funeral and share their grief and anger with the citizens of Brest. Eighty thousand people participated in the funeral procession, and a general meeting was held before the funeral. At the beginning of the meeting, all factories, ports, and many railway stations and public institutions across France stopped work. Many cities held rallies, passing resolutions demanding an end to police suppression measures, the dissolution of the "Republican Security Force," and the establishment of a democratic coalition government.

　　法数百万工人罢工抗议布勒斯特血案
    八万人民怀着悲愤参加马兹葬礼
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻巴黎特派记者朱可夫报道：布勒斯特发生枪击工人示威行列的消息，在法国每一地区都引起了暴风雨般的反响。十九日夜，当被警察杀害的工人马兹的灵柩下葬的时候，几百万法国工人响应总工会的号召开始罢工，以抗议实施警察镇压的统治，并要求解散所谓“共和国保安队”。
    人民的愤怒如此高昂，以致当局不敢阻止工人的示威运动。总罢工已在布勒斯特发动，所有工厂、运输业及公共机关都陷于停顿。商店闭市，全港死气沉沉。几千人民徒步或乘火车自布列塔尼半岛各地赶来参加马兹的葬礼，并与布勒斯特的公民同伸悲悼与愤怒。有八万人参加出殡行列，在出殡之前曾开大会。大会开始时，全法各工厂、港口及许多铁路车站和公共机关一律停工。许多城市都举行集会，通过决议，要求停止警察镇压措施，解散“共和国保安队”以及成立民主联合政府。
