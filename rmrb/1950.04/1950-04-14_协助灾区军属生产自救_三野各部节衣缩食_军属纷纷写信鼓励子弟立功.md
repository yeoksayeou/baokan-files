Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: The People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army units have thoroughly carried out ideological education regarding the problems of military families, while simultaneously launching a campaign to conserve food and clothing, provide relief to impoverished military families, and assist military families in production and self-help. As a result, the livelihood problems of military families in certain areas, particularly disaster areas, have been initially resolved.

Due to the floods and droughts in some areas last year, and the long period of exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the vast newly liberated areas, the living conditions of impoverished military families were quite difficult. Consequently, they wrote letters or came to the units requesting relief. The Political Department of the Field Army and the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels conducted ideological education within the troops, making the soldiers aware of the state's financial difficulties and the principle of self-reliance through production for military families. At the same time, they combined this with a production and conservation campaign to help military families solve specific difficulties. They also sent慰问团 (comfort groups) deep into the disaster areas to persuade and organize military families for production and self-help.

Since January 1st, the entire army has saved one liang (approximately 50 grams) of grain per person per day. In addition, a portion of the grain surplus from last year and the production surplus from this year has been used to help impoverished military families. With the approval of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, three-quarters of the party dues from all party members in the first half of this year have also been transferred as relief funds. According to incomplete statistics, various units have allocated over 5 million jin (2.5 million kilograms) of relief grain and over 800 million yuan (old currency) in Renminbi. Among them, a certain army corps carried out mutual assistance among some commanders and fighters, contributing subsidies, daily necessities, and cigarette allowances amounting to over 140 million yuan. In addition, more than 10,000 items of daily necessities were donated and converted into relief funds. Most of these grains and funds have been used to help impoverished military families, and a portion has been used to help disaster-stricken civilians in the garrison areas.

The question of "who should receive relief" and "how much relief" was discussed by groups or classes, and democratically evaluated by the Revolutionary Servicemen's Committee or the Servicemen's Congress, before being finally approved by the higher-level political organs. The relief amount ranged from 30 jin to 200 jin of grain. Many party members, cadres, and soldiers whose families were in the old liberated areas, although in difficult circumstances, voluntarily allowed military families in the newly liberated areas to receive priority relief. The family of Yin Dehua, a soldier in the machine gun company of a certain regiment, was in a disaster area in the old liberated area. He said, "Although my family is suffering, it is still better than the newly liberated areas because of the land reform." At the evaluation meeting, he proposed that his family's relief funds be given to military families in the newly liberated areas.

The military family comfort groups organized by various units went deep into the disaster areas to conduct comfort and relief work. Under the guidance of local governments, they convened military family representative meetings, reported on the recent situation of the soldiers, and assisted the local people's governments in organizing military families for production and self-help. They then brought the situation of the military families back to the units to report to everyone, so that soldiers and military families could understand each other's situations and work and produce with peace of mind. The Zhejiang Military Region and the East Zhejiang Frontline Troops of a certain army corps, along with the Shanghai Garrison Troops, organized comfort groups that carried over 2.1 million jin of conserved grain, over 300 million yuan in Renminbi, and over 20,000 letters and慰问信 (letters of condolence) from commanders and fighters to Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu to comfort military families before and after the Spring Festival. The work of the comfort groups achieved great results. Many military families dispelled the idea of going to the troops after being comforted. For example, in the Tea Leaf District of Laiwu County, Shandong Province, 728 military families originally planned to go to the troops, but after receiving joint education from the comfort group and the local people's government, realizing the importance of self-reliance through production, and receiving practical help to solve some difficulties, they decided not to go to the troops. They also wrote letters encouraging their children to strive for meritorious service. One district alone entrusted the comfort group to bring home more than 2,000 letters. After learning about the situation of their families overcoming difficulties through production with the assistance of the people's government, the morale of the commanders and fighters in the troops was greatly stabilized. They unanimously resolved to accelerate the elimination of the remaining bandits at sea, accelerate the construction of a new China, eliminate the root causes of disasters, and permanently improve the lives of their families and the people of the whole country. Many soldiers educated their families in the letters they wrote home to carry out production and self-help. Some soldiers even drew up production and famine-prevention plans for their families, advising their relatives not to come to the troops to avoid wasting money and time. They told their families that the current difficulties were temporary and could be gradually alleviated once the remaining bandits were completely eliminated. In the meantime, production and self-help were the only way to overcome difficulties.

### 协助灾区军属生产自救  三野各部节衣缩食  军属纷纷写信鼓励子弟立功

　　协助灾区军属生产自救
    三野各部节衣缩食
    军属纷纷写信鼓励子弟立功
    【新华社南京十二日电】人民解放军第三野战军各部，深入展开了对军人家属问题的思想教育，并同时展开节衣缩食运动，救济贫苦军属，协助军属生产自救，使若干地区特别是灾区的军属生活问题得到了初步的解决。
    由于去年若干地区水旱成灾，广大新解放区又曾久在国民党匪帮横征暴敛之下，贫苦军属生活相当困难，因而纷纷写信或来到部队要求救济。野战军政治部和各级中国共产党党委即在部队中进行思想教育，使战士们认识到国家财政的困难和军属生产自救的道理，同时结合生产节约运动，协助军属解决具体困难；并派出慰问团深入灾区，说服、组织军属生产自救。
    全军自一月一日起，每人每日节约粮食一两，另将去年粮食节余和今年生产盈余的一部，都用作救助贫苦军属之用。今年上半年全军党员党费的四分之三，也经中共中央批准移作救济款项。据不完全统计，各部已拨出救济粮五百万余斤、人民币八亿余万元，其中某兵团由一部分指战员们自动进行互助互济，献出的津贴费、日用品和香烟费即达一亿四千余万元。此外尚捐出一万多件日用品折价作救济费。这些粮款大部已救济了贫苦军属，一部则用作救济驻地灾胞。
    “谁该救济”、“救济多少”，都由小组或班提出讨论，经革命军人委员会或军人大会民主评定，再由上级政治机关最后批准。救济数额为粮食三十斤到二百斤。很多党员、干部和家在老解放区的战士的家属虽然很困难，但都自动让在新解放区的军属优先获得救济。某团机枪连战士尹德华的家属在老解放区的灾区，他说：“我家虽然苦，但经过了土地改革，比新解放区总要好些。”他在评议会上提议将他家的救济金让给新解放区的军属。
    各部组织的军属慰问团，深入灾区进行慰问救济，并在当地政府指导下召开军属代表会，报告子弟兵近况，协助当地人民政府组织军属生产自救；再将军属的情况带回部队向大家报告，使战士军属互相了解情况后，都能安心工作和生产。浙江军区暨某兵团浙东前线部队和上海警备部队所组织的慰问团，在春节前后携带节约的粮食二百十余万斤、人民币三亿余元和指战员的家书、慰问信二万多封，到山东、皖北、苏北等地慰问军属。慰问团的工作收到很大的效果，很多军属经慰问后都打消了到部队来的念头。如山东莱芜县茶叶区本来有七百二十八户军属打算到部队来，但在得到慰问团和当地人民政府共同的教育，认识生产自救的重要并得到了实际的帮助，解决一些困难后都决定不来部队了，并且写信鼓励子弟努力立功。仅一个区就托慰问团带回家信二千多封。部队指战员们在了解了家庭在人民政府协助下生产渡荒的情况后，情绪大为稳定，并一致决心加速消灭海上残匪，加速建设新中国，去掉灾荒祸根，永久改善家庭和全国人民的生活。许多战士在写给家里的信中都教育家庭进行生产自救，有的战士更给家里订了生产备荒的计划，劝说亲人不要来部队，以免耗费财力和时间；并告诉家里人说：眼前的困难是暂时的，这种困难只要残匪完全消灭，就可以逐步解除；在眼前，生产自救是克服困难的唯一办法。
