　　[Our Newspaper] Last night (17th) at 10 PM, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially convened a meeting of responsible comrades from some public factories' trade unions in Beijing to discuss how to support unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai. This meeting fully demonstrated the Chinese workers' fraternal unity and enthusiasm for mutual assistance. At the meeting, Huo Zhaolin, Chairman of the Beijing Postal Workers' Union, said, "Our Beijing Postal District Union has more than 4,000 workers and expresses deep sympathy for the unemployed brothers in Shanghai. Postal workers have a fine tradition in this regard. During the first liberation of Zhangjiakou, postal workers throughout Jin-Cha-Ji were involved in donation campaigns to support the front lines, with some veteran workers donating over 200 jin of rice. This time, we must do everything possible to support our Shanghai worker brothers." Ying Yongxing, Chairman of the Beijing Machine Factory No. 1 Union, said, "Last year, to help the country overcome difficulties, two-thirds of the machine union workers voluntarily gave up their year-end double salary bonus. This time, we will exert even greater efforts to support our unemployed brothers in Shanghai." Meng Jinsheng, Chairman of the Telecommunications Bureau Union, said, "The American and Chiang bombings have caused the unemployment of our Shanghai worker brothers. We should display class friendship, make the greatest efforts to rescue them. Our union's standing committee has already discussed this. Everyone has decided to support the unemployed brothers in Shanghai." He also pointed out, "Disaster relief donations of rice have been ongoing from last October until today and some are prepared to continue until June this year." Su Rui, Chairman of the Clothing Factory Union, said, "When we were holding a management committee meeting, the news came that Shanghai worker brothers were requesting mutual assistance and relief, and everyone expressed enthusiastic sympathy. We plan to implement voluntary overtime to support them." While the Machine General Factory was holding a joint meeting of group leaders, they heard this news, and someone immediately proposed working an extra day to support the unemployed brothers in Shanghai. Guan Xin of the factory union said, "Our disaster relief donations have continued to this day. This time, in supporting our own brothers, we must show even greater courage." Guo Maolin of the 70th Ordnance Factory said, "Although we have difficulties, it is still much better than their unemployment. We must adopt various methods to mobilize everyone to respond." Su Rui said, "Our working class must take the lead in mutual assistance and relief." The representative of the Tram Company Union did not arrive in time for the meeting, but specially expressed to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions by telephone: "Our tram workers will definitely support the unemployed brothers in Shanghai."

　　[Our Newspaper] Yesterday (17th), after seeing the Shanghai worker brothers' appeal in the newspaper, the public factories in the capital expressed infinite resentment towards the American imperialists and Chiang bandits, and deep sympathy towards the Shanghai worker brothers who were unemployed due to the American and Chiang's criminal actions. After hearing this news, the workers of the Beijing Machine Factory No. 1 discussed one after another, calling for stepping up production to eliminate the remnants of the Taiwan bandits. They also believed that the working class is one family, and if they have difficulties, we should help. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant convened an emergency meeting of party, government, union, and league cadres yesterday afternoon. They unanimously agreed to call on all employees to launch a movement to donate one day's wage. Those with voluntary overtime should work voluntary overtime, and those without voluntary overtime should participate in work such as collecting scrap iron, and the remuneration from scrap iron collection should be donated. After the union committee and group leader joint meeting of the Political Department Printing Plant of the North China Military Region read the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, one apprentice immediately wanted to donate two days' wages. Because he was an apprentice and earned less, the union advised him to donate less, but he still insisted on his original opinion. The Xinhua Printing Plant held a union executive committee meeting at noon yesterday and made a decision to support. Not long after the meeting, the 16 comrades in the cutting room decided to donate one day's wage each, and non-members also participated in this movement. Han Zhenting, a worker at the Water Company, said, "We can still maintain our lives, so donating one day's wage is no problem for me."

　　Tianjin
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] After reading the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' message calling on workers across the country to support unemployed workers in Shanghai, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin expressed enthusiastic support. The person in charge of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: Shanghai worker brothers have assisted the struggles of worker brothers in other parts of the country in the modern Chinese revolutionary struggle. Today, it is our responsibility to actively support them. The Federation has decided to call on nearly 400,000 employed workers in the city to do everything necessary and possible to help Shanghai's unemployed worker brothers overcome this temporary difficulty. Workers and staff in various factories have taken practical actions to support Shanghai workers. Trade unions in units such as China Textile Factory No. 1, rubber factory affiliated to the Municipal Industrial Bureau, tannery, China Match Factory, Tianjin East Railway Station, East Asia Tobacco Factory, Dyeing and Finishing Factory No. 3, and private Shoufeng Flour Mill have all held various forms of meetings, calling on all employees to carry out one day of voluntary labor and donate their wages to unemployed workers in Shanghai. At a joint meeting of party, government, union, and league representatives at China Textile Factory No. 5, veteran worker Hao Qingyuan and communist party member Li Shaohua, and others donated many items such as cloth and flour. Twenty employees of the Tianjin United Underwear Factory, which recently moved to Tianjin from Shanghai, raised more than 390,000 yuan, and 160 employees of the Tianjin Private Lihe Thread Company also donated more than 1.6 million yuan to support Shanghai workers. Many workers said: The suffering of Shanghai workers is our suffering, and we must give full play to the spirit of class friendship to support them.

    【本报讯】昨晚（十七日）十时，北京市总工会特召集了京市一部分公营工厂工会负责同志的会议，讨论如何支援上海失业工人兄弟的问题。这个会上充分表现了中国工人兄弟的团结友好互相帮助的热情。在这次会上，北京区邮政工会主席霍兆麟说：“我们北京邮区工会拥有四千多工人，对上海失业的兄弟们表示深切的同情。邮政工人在这方面，有优良的传统。第一次张家口解放时，全晋察冀的邮工，都卷入支援前线的捐助运动，有的老工人拿了二百多斤米。这次更要想尽办法来支援上海工人兄弟。”北京机器一分厂工会主席英永兴说：“去年机器工会工人，为了帮助国家克服困难，有三分之二工人自动放弃了年终双薪奖金，这次我们将尽更大力量支援上海失业兄弟。”电信局工会主席孟金声说：“美蒋轰炸，造成了上海工人兄弟们的失业，我们应该发挥阶级友爱，尽最大的努力，解救他们，我们工会常委会已经讨论过了。大家决定要支援上海失业兄弟们。”他并指出：“救灾捐米，从去年十月起到今天还在进行着，有的准备继续到今年六月。”被服厂工会主席苏瑞说：“我们正开管委会时，上海工人兄弟请求互助救济的消息传来，大家都热烈表示同情，我们计划实行义务加班来支援他们。”机器总厂正开小组长联席会时，听到了这个消息，立刻有人提议加班一天来支援上海失业兄弟。该厂工会关欣说：“我们救灾捐助，一直坚持到现在，这次支援自己的兄弟，一定要表现得更勇敢。”七十兵工厂工会郭茂林说：“我们虽然有困难，但总比他们失业强得多，我们要采用各种方式，来动员大家响应。”苏瑞说：“我们工人阶级要在互助救济中起带头作用”。电车公司工会的代表没有来及到会，但电话上特别向市总工会表示：“我们电车工人，一定支援上海的失业兄弟。”
    【本报讯】首都各公营工厂，昨天（十七日）见到报纸上上海工人兄弟的呼吁消息后，对美帝蒋匪的轰炸封锁，表示无限愤恨，对在美蒋罪恶行动下失业的上海工人兄弟，表示深切同情。北京机器一分厂工人听到这一消息后，纷纷谈论，要加紧生产消灭台湾残匪。并认为工人阶级是一家，他们有困难，我们就应该帮助。石景山钢铁厂，昨天下午，召集了党政工团干部的紧急会议，一致同意，号召全体职工，展开捐助一日工资运动，有义务加班的义务加班，没有义务加班的参加拣废铁等工作，以拣废铁所得报酬作为捐助。华北军区政治部印刷厂，在工会委员和小组长联席会上宣读了上海工会致全总的信后，当时就有一个学徒要捐两天的工资，工会因他是学徒，挣钱少，劝他少捐点，他仍坚持原来意见。新华印刷厂，昨天中午，开了工会执委会，作了支援的决定，散会后不大一会，断裁室的十六位同志就决定每人捐工资一天，并且非会员也参加了这一运动。自来水公司工人韩振庭说：“咱们还可以维持生活，我捐一天工资不成问题。”
    天津
    【新华社天津十七日电】津市广大工人群众于阅读上海总工会呼吁全国工人支持上海失业工人的消息后，纷纷表示热烈支援。市总工会负责人发表谈话说：上海工人兄弟在中国近代革命斗争中，援助过其他各地工人弟兄的斗争。今天我们积极支持他们，是我们的责任。本会决号召全市近四十万在业工人，尽必要与可能的力量，为支援上海失业工人兄弟渡过这一暂时的困难而努力。各工厂职工纷纷以实际行动支援上海工人。中纺一厂、市工业局所属橡胶厂、制革厂、中华火柴厂及天津东站、东亚烟草厂，染整第三厂、私营寿丰面粉厂等单位工会，都召开了各种形式的会议，号召全体职工进行一日义务劳动，将工资捐助上海失业工人。中纺五厂在党政工团联席会上，老工人郝庆元、共产党员李少华等捐出布、面等许多物品。从上海迁津不久的天津联营内衣制造厂二十名职工募捐了三十九万余元，天津市私营利和线物公司一百六十名职工也捐献了一百六十余万元，支援上海工人。很多工人表示：上海工人的痛苦，就是我们的痛苦，我们一定发挥阶级友爱的精神支援他们。
