About Stamp Duty

Question:
    I have several questions about stamp duty, please answer them:
    (1) Stamp duty is a reasonable national tax. Are the stamp duty ticket sales points determined by the government, and are there fixed sales points?
    (2) Who should be responsible for the discovery of fake stamps? Should the buyer or the seller be punished?
    (3) Why do tax bureau personnel insist on people buying a lot of stamps when they inspect taxes?
    (4) Why must large-denomination stamps (10,000 and 5,000) be purchased at the tax bureau?
    (5) When will the stamp duty rate be announced?
                                      A small businessman in Xicheng answers:
    Your questions have been answered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau as follows:
    (1) There are fixed sales points for stamps. Sales points are established only after application and approval.
    (2) All stamp purchasers should have a receipt or stamp issued by the sales point as proof. We have not yet discovered any cases of sales points selling counterfeit stamps. If there is a sale of counterfeit stamps on the market, please report it as soon as possible. (The address of this bureau is B21, Donghuangchenggen, District 1)
    (3) Regarding the issue of tax cadres selling stamps, it is because sales points are not yet widespread. To accommodate the difficulty merchants have in purchasing stamps, individual sub-bureaus have cadres selling stamps on behalf of the bureau, requiring tax-evading merchants to purchase and affix them immediately. However, there is no limit on the quantity of stamps purchased.
    (4) Large-denomination stamps of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan are sold not only at various tax sub-bureaus, but also at the People's Bank of China and the Post Office.
    (5) The current stamp duty law and tax rate table were published in the Guangming Daily on October 28 last year; supplementary explanations were published in the People's Daily on November 5. Tax adjustments were also announced in the People's Daily on November 21, December 21, and March 1 this year, respectively. At the same time, this tax law and tax rate table have been distributed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, post offices, banks, and various sales points. For any unclear issues regarding stamp duty, in addition to inquiring with this bureau and its subordinate sub-bureaus, you can also inquire at the above locations.

### 关于印花税

专栏：

　　关于印花税问：
    我有几个关于印花税的问题，请你们解答一下：
    （一）印花税是国家的合理税收，代售税票处是不是由政府规定的，有无一定的代售处？
    （二）发现了假印花应该由谁负责？处罚买者，还是卖者呢？
    （三）为什么税局人员查税时硬要人购很多印花？
    （四）大额印花税票（一万的五千的）为何一定要到税局去买？
    （五）印花税率何日公布？
                                      西城一个小买卖人答：
    你的问题。已经由北京市人民政府税务局解答如下：
    （一）印花有一定的代销店。代销店都是经过申请批准后才设立的。
    （二）凡购买印花者，都应由代销店开立单据或盖章证明。代销店销售伪花的情况，我们还未发现。如在市面有销售伪花的事，请从速检举。（本局局址是内一区东皇城根乙二十一号）
    （三）关于税工干部销花问题，系因代销店尚未普遍，为了照顾商人购花困难，个别分局有由干部代销印花，要漏税商人即时购贴，惟对于购花数量，并无限制。
    （四）五千元及一万元的大额印花，除各税务分局出售外，人民银行及邮局亦有代售。
    （五）现行印花税税法及税率表，曾于去年十月二十八日在光明日报刊载；十一月五日又在人民日报刊登补充说明。税额调整亦曾于十一月二十一日、十二月二十一日及今年三月一日，分别在人民日报公布。同时此项税法及税率表，已分发市商会、邮局、银行及各代销店。对于印花税有不明了的问题，除向本局及所属分局探询外，到以上各处也都能打听明白。
