　　Introducing the Rope-Bound Abacus

　　When the Chahar Provincial United Middle School was in the Laiyuan mountain area, I made my own hanging abacus to solve the difficulties of abacus teaching. The method is: use sticks and ropes to tie into a frame and rods, cut the sticks into one-inch-long segments as beads, and use hemp rope as pillars. The beads should have two holes as thick as the rope. When the rope passes through the hole, it should be slightly tighter (so that the beads will not rotate left and right, and will not fall automatically when pushed up). Recently, I have changed the frame and beads of this hanging abacus to wood.

　　The old-fashioned abacus is made of iron wire and wool twisted into pillars, so it is also called the "mao" abacus. Ordinary carpenters cannot make it, and it is very expensive. It is difficult to make, and it cannot be repaired when the "mao" falls off. But this rope-bound abacus does not have the above shortcomings. Therefore, I would like to introduce the method of making this kind of abacus to everyone. (Ding Yuwen)

　　介绍绳制挂算
    察省联合中学在涞源山地时，我为解决珠算教学的困难，曾自造挂算。方法是：用棒子杆和绳捆成框和档，把棒子杆截成一寸长的段当珠，用麻绳当柱，珠上穿两个和绳的粗细一样大小的孔。当绳穿过孔时须稍微紧点（这样可使珠不会左右转动，且推上去不会自动落下）。最近，我又把这挂算的框和珠改用木制。
    旧式挂算，是拿铁丝和毛扭成柱，所以又名毛算，普通木工不能造，价钱很贵，打时很费劲，毛落了不能修理。但这绳制挂算却无以上缺点。因此，我把这种挂算的作法介绍给大家。      （丁玉文）
