　　Deepen Leadership and Issue Loans in a Timely Manner:
    Rehe Disaster Areas Universally Plant
    Southern Counties Complete Wheat Planting; The Whole Province Universally Starts Plowing to Plant Fields
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Northeast Daily news: Thanks to the in-depth leadership of cadres and the government's timely issuance of agricultural loans and disaster relief grain loans, most disaster areas in Rehe Province have universally started planting fields and early-maturing crops. At the beginning of January, the province dispatched a disaster relief work team of over a thousand cadres to cooperate with county and district cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, mobilize disaster victims to produce for self-relief, and stabilize the emotions of the disaster victims. In late February, a disaster area work conference was also held. While clearly putting forward the policy of shifting the work focus to spring plowing and production, it also dispatched a work team of over nine hundred people to the countryside, and successively allocated 75 billion (Northeast currency) of agricultural loans and a portion of livestock, farm tools, seeds, and 18 million catties of spring plowing production disaster relief grain loans to support disaster victims in spring plowing. By the end of March, most areas had shifted to focusing on preparing for spring plowing and production. According to inspections in twelve counties and banners including Qinglong, more than 80% of the accumulated manure had been sent out, and spring plowing had been universally carried out. After the Qingming Festival, all parts of the province had thorough rainfall, and farmers in the northern and southern counties had started plowing to plant fields or early-maturing crops. In the southern Pingquan, Lingyuan, Chengde, and Qinglong areas, early-maturing crops had basically been planted. Qinglong and Chengde counties alone had planted more than 80,000 mu of barley, wheat, potatoes, etc. In some areas, due to the practical organization of labor exchange groups, surplus labor was extracted from agricultural production to engage in sideline production to earn food. For example, in Songjunshan Village, Sixth District, Qinglong County, after being organized, 35 people were extracted to mine gold, earning more than 5,200 catties of rice in a month, providing strong support for spring plowing.

　　深入领导及时发下贷款
    热河灾区普遍播种
    南部各县播完小麦，全省普遍开犁种大田
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：由于干部深入领导和政府及时发放农贷、救灾贷粮，热河省大部灾区已普遍开始播种大田和早熟作物。一月初该省派出千余干部的救灾工作团配合各县、区干部深入灾区，发动灾民生产自救，稳定了灾民情绪。二月下旬又召开了灾区工作会议，在明确提出将工作中心转入春耕生产的方针同时，又派九百余人的工作团下乡，并先后拨发了七百五十亿（东北券）的农业贷款及一部牲畜、农具、籽种和一千八百万斤春耕生产救灾贷粮，扶助灾民春耕。至三月末，大部地区均已转入以准备春耕生产为主。根据青龙等十二个县旗的检查，即已送出所积之粪百分之八十以上，并普遍的进行了春翻地。清明过后，全省各地均落透雨，南北部各县农民已开犁播种大田或早熟作物。而南部平泉、凌原、承德、青龙地区的早熟作物已基本上种完，仅青龙、承德二县即已种完大麦、小麦、土豆等八万余亩。而部分地区，由于切实的组织了换工小组，从而抽出农业生产的剩余劳力进行副业生产挣吃粮。如青龙县六区送军山村，组织起来后抽出三十五个人挖金，一个月赚米五千二百多斤，予春耕以有力支持。
