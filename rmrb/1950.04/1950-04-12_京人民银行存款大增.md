Beijing Municipal News Agency: After the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China adapted to the stable price situation and improved its deposit business in a timely manner, deposit figures increased significantly. By April 10, accumulated deposits had increased by 118 percent compared to the end of February, and by 17 percent compared to the end of March. Based on this situation, the branch is confident of exceeding its total deposit target for this year.

The fundamental reason for the significant increase in deposits is that prices are stable, the value of the currency is becoming increasingly solid, and the general public's idea of valuing goods over money has begun to change. At the same time, the branch has changed its past passive approach of waiting for customers in its deposit business, increased the number of field staff to go deep into the masses, actively contacted old accounts and developed new accounts, and combined various businesses to absorb deposits. For industrial and commercial households with a large number of remittances or collection payments, efforts were made to establish accounts and preferential discounts were given on exchange rates. For example, the Dongcheng Office of the branch sent personnel to visit shops on Wangfujing Street to listen to opinions on improving business and solicit the opening of accounts. As a result, more than 30 new accounts were added in early April. In addition, efforts were made to simplify deposit procedures, improve work efficiency, implement a small cashier system, and use card-style accounting to reduce customer waiting time.

The Beijing Branch's vigorous absorption of deposits has reduced market liquidity, further stabilized the financial situation, and become a powerful factor in stabilizing prices.

　　京人民银行存款大增
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民银行北京分行适应物价稳定情况及时改进存款业务后，存款数字大大增加。到四月十日存款累积比二月底增加百分之一百一十八，比三月底增加百分之十七。根据这个情况，该分行有把握超额完成今年存款总任务。存款显著增加的基本原因是物价平稳，币值日趋巩固，一般人重物轻币的思想已开始扭转，同时，该分行在存款业务上改变了过去等待的被动的作风，增调外勤人员深入群众，主动联系旧户头开展新户头，结合各种业务吸收存款；对汇款或代收款较多的工商业户，争取建立户头，在汇率上予以折扣优待。如该分行东城办事处曾派员挨门访问王府井大街商号。听取改进业务的意见，征求开立户头，结果，在四月上旬增加了三十余户。此外，并力求简化存款手续，提高工作效率，实行小出纳制度，改用卡片式记帐，减少顾客等候的时间。该分行大力吸收存款的结果，使市场游资减少，金融更趋稳定，又成为物价平稳一个有力因素。
