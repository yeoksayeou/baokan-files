　　Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department
    Executes Two Brothel Owners
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to news from the Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department sentenced Huang Wanshi and Huang Shuqing, the extremely wicked owners and managers of the Hua Qing Guan brothel, to death at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 6th). They were immediately bound and taken to the execution ground and shot. Huang Wanshi came from a landlord background and cohabitated with the rogue Huang Shuqing. In 1942, they jointly opened the Hua Qing Guan brothel, where they successively took in more than 30 women, including Li Hongbao, through contracts and purchases. They privately established torture chambers and carried out extremely cruel and barbaric beatings, which resulted in the deaths of five people. After the liberation of this city, the two criminals showed no remorse and continued their evil acts. In order to severely punish such bullies who persecuted people to death and cruelly exploited and oppressed women, the Military Control Commission Military Law Department sentenced the two criminals to death in accordance with the law and confiscated their property.
