　　Shulu Corrects Neglect of Leadership in Spring Farming
    County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Has Prepared 1.6 Million Jin of High-Quality Cotton Seeds for Emergency Loans or Sales.
    [Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] In early April, responsible cadres from various agencies in Shulu County, Hebei Province, convened a meeting to re-examine and improve leadership in production. They acknowledged that although the slogan "Production First" had been repeatedly raised in the past, the actual order of priority in each district was production assessment and quota setting first, democratic governance second, and production third (details in this newspaper's April 4th issue). To resolutely reverse this serious tendency of neglecting production leadership, the meeting repeatedly studied the instructions from the provincial and regional governments regarding strengthening spring farming leadership, as well as the Hebei Daily's editorial. Each comrade gained a clearer understanding that spring farming production is the current overriding central task. The meeting immediately decided that villages unable to complete production assessments by April 10th should postpone them until after the wheat harvest. All cadres in each district, except for finance and grain cadres responsible for managing the joint assessment of production output to be completed before the 10th, should immediately focus on spring farming production work (integrated with democratic governance), requiring each district cadre to go to the villages and complete certain tasks related to mobilizing the masses for production within a specific period (such as lending out several waterwheels, digging several wells, etc.). Upon arriving in the villages, they should first understand the overall situation, and based on the village's conditions, characteristics, and the masses' demands, determine the key areas for production leadership. They should strengthen the organization and work of the village production committees, assist them in division of labor and planning, and combine the efforts of various departments to vigorously promote the implementation of spring farming production leadership. Secondly, they should cultivate production labor models to motivate the masses and conduct in-depth investigations into households lacking labor or draught animals, leading and organizing mutual aid and partnership starting from one household or one person. It was also clearly stated that the current focus should be on intensively leading the masses in plowing, harrowing, preparing seeds, making household plans, and reserving cotton fields. They should also pay close attention to resolving the masses' ideological concerns. They should strictly prevent bad leadership methods such as only holding meetings and collecting statistics upon arriving in the villages, delaying the production of cadres and the masses, and only approaching cadres without approaching the masses. Currently, responsible cadres from various county departments have led fourteen cadres who could be spared from their respective departments to personally implement this work in each district, in order to reverse the existing deviation.

    [Another Dispatch] The Shulu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province, after re-examining the neglect of production leadership, is massively and rapidly distributing cotton seeds in order not to miss the agricultural season. Recently, the county's Supply and Marketing Cooperative exchanged 200,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds from the Xinji Cotton and Cloth Branch Company through business connections. Together with 1.2 million jin of Grade A and 200,000 jin of Grade B high-quality cotton seeds selected from the Si Zi cotton collected during last autumn's tax collection, totaling 1.6 million jin (enough to plant more than 200,000 mu of cotton), they are prepared to lend, exchange, and sell all of it to the masses. More than half will be loaned to cotton farmers who are genuinely facing difficulties and lacking cotton seeds, to be repaid with wheat after the wheat harvest. The remaining portion will be quickly exchanged or sold through various means. To do this quickly and make it convenient for the masses, they have also combined with the county government to dispatch ten cadres to each district to specifically supervise, manage, and handle the procedures. The county government has also instructed cadres in each district and village to earnestly mobilize and organize the masses to quickly collectively borrow or exchange. They are required to completely distribute the seeds to cotton farmers before the 10th, to meet the cotton farmers' seed requirements. Currently, each district and village is busy mobilizing the masses to borrow and purchase.

　　束鹿纠正忽视领导春耕
    县供销社已准备优良棉种一百六十万斤，突击贷出或换卖。
    【本报讯】四月初，河北束鹿县各机关负责干部集会，再次检讨与改进生产领导。认为过去虽一再提出“生产第一”的口号，但实际上各区均以评产订量工作为第一，民主建政次之，生产第三（详情见本月四日本报）。为了坚决扭转这种忽视领导生产的严重偏向，会上反复研究了省府、专区关于加强春耕领导的指示及河北日报的社论，每个同志更明确认识到春耕生产是当前压倒一切的中心任务。会议即决定凡在四月十号前不能做好评产的村，一律推迟至麦收后再做。各区除财粮干部负责掌握十号前能完成的联评产量工作外，全数干部要马上抓紧春耕生产工作（建政结合进行），要求每个区干部到村，在一定时期完成一定的发动群众进行生产的任务（如贷出几架水车，打几眼井等）。到村后首先了解全村情况，根据村的条件、特点、群众要求，决定领导生产重点。加强村生产委员会的组织和工作，帮助其分工与计划，结合各部门力量，大力推动贯彻春耕生产领导。其次是培养生产劳动模范，带动群众并深入调查缺乏劳、畜力对象，从一户一人着手领导组织互助插伙。又明确提出当前应以突击领导群众耕地、耙地、准备种籽、做户计划、留棉田为主。并随时注意解除群众的思想顾虑。严格防止到村光开会统计数字，耽误干部、群众生产，和只接近干部，不接近群众的恶劣领导办法。现县各部门负责干部已带领各部门能抽出之干部十四人，分头到各区亲自贯彻这项工作，以扭转现存偏向。

    【又讯】河北束鹿县供销合作社，在该县再次检讨忽视生产领导后，为不误农时，大量突击发放棉种。最近该县供销合作社通过业务关系，向辛集花纱布支公司换来优良棉籽二十万斤，连同从去年秋征征收的斯字棉中选出的优良棉种甲等一百二十万斤，乙等二十万斤，共一百六十万斤（可种棉二十多万亩），准备全数贷换卖给群众。以半数以上贷给确实困难、缺棉籽的种棉农民，麦收后归还小麦。其余部分以各种办法迅速换卖。为了做的快和使群众方便，又和县政府结合抽出十个干部，分到各区专门督促、掌握和办理手续。县府也指示各区、村干部要认真发动组织群众迅速集体贷、换。要求在十号前完全发放到棉农手里，满足棉农种籽要求。现各区、村正忙着发动群众贷买中。
