　　The Evil Consequences of Marshallization
    Soaring Prices in Norway
    Widespread Public Dissatisfaction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 7th Dispatch] The Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty are leading Norway down a path of hardship. According to a TASS dispatch from Oslo on the 4th, the Norwegian government has ordered another substantial increase in food prices, effective from the 3rd. Butter has risen by 23 percent, margarine and wheat flour by 58 percent, rye flour by 75 percent, and various grains by 33 to 68 percent. Prime Minister Gerhardsen stated in a broadcast that the prices of textiles, shoes, and certain other items will also rise in the near future, but there is no question of increasing wages at present.
    Meanwhile, the Social Democratic government, in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty's aggressive plans, is investing huge financial resources in war preparations and participating in the arms race. Norway's military budget this year will actually reach 500 million kroner, ten times that of the pre-war era. Under the North Atlantic Treaty, Norway is forced to supply strategic raw materials and assets cheaply to the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty in exchange for British and American manufactured goods.
    The evil consequences of Marshallization and militarization in Norway have aroused widespread discontent among the masses. The Norwegian Peace Committee is launching nationwide protest rallies against the arms race and war propaganda. The Communist Party's organ newspaper, in an editorial, urged workers to demand wage increases as fair compensation for this price increase.

　　马歇尔化的恶果
    挪威物价狂涨
    广大人民不满
    【新华社七日讯】马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约，正把挪威引向困苦的道路。据塔斯社奥斯陆四日讯，挪威政府已下令粮食价格自三日起再度大大提高。牛油涨百分之二十三，人造牛油、小麦面粉涨百分之五十八，裸麦面粉上涨百分之七十五，各种谷物涨百分之三十三至百分之六十八。总理基哈德森于广播中称，纺织品、鞋子和若干其他物品的价格在最近的将来亦将上涨，但目前尚谈不到增加工资的问题。
    同时，社会民主党政府按照大西洋公约侵略计划，正以巨大的财力投入战争准备，参加军备竞赛。挪威军事预算今年总数实际将达到五亿克罗纳，为战前的十倍。在大西洋公约下，挪威被迫以战略原料同资产货廉价供给大西洋公约签字国，以换取英美制成品。
    挪威马歇尔化与军事化的恶果，引起了广大群众普遍的不满。挪威和平委员会正发动全国举行抗议集会，反对军备竞赛及战争宣传。共产党机关报于社论中，敦促工人要求增加工资作为此次物价上涨的公平补偿。
