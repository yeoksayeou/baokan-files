　　The Army and the People as One Family
    The North China Military Region Practices Economy to Aid Disaster Relief; Hebei Provincial Government Sends Letter of Thanks

To the Political Department of the North China Military Region and all commanders and fighters:

    You have all been diligently saving on food and clothing to help our disaster-stricken fellow countrymen, enthusiastically carrying out the “one or two meters” economy movement, donating and saving a total of 3.6 million jin of grain, and allocating 1.6 million jin to our province. We have swiftly distributed this large amount of grain to the severely affected areas to solve the difficulties of the disaster victims in production and life and have conveyed your kindness in caring for the disaster victims to the masses in the affected areas. We hereby express our gratitude to you on behalf of all disaster victims in the province.

    Although the disaster situation in our province is severe, with the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the allocation of a large amount of disaster relief grain, as well as the support of all parties and the active efforts of all cadres to lead the masses in carrying out production for self-relief, the disaster has now stopped developing. We are now continuing our efforts to implement the Central Government's instructions on production and disaster relief, leading the masses to carry out various sideline productions, seizing the opportunity for spring plowing, and effectively solving the problem of land cultivation on behalf of military families in disaster areas, to overcome the spring famine. We would like to inform the people of the whole country of this!

    With best regards,
                            Hebei Provincial People's Government March 17th

    华北军区节约救灾  河北省府致函感谢华北军区政治部并转全体指战员同志们：
    你们为援救苦难中的灾胞，全军节衣缩食，热烈开展了一两米的节约运动，捐输节约粮食三百六十万斤，并分配我省一百六十万斤。此巨额粮食，我们已迅速分发给各重灾区，以解决灾民生产和生活上的困难，并把你们关怀灾民的好意转告各灾区群众，兹特代表全省受灾灾民向你们致谢。
    本省灾情虽属严重，但有中央人民政府的正确领导、并拨发大批赈粮、同时有各方面的支援以及全体干部领导群众积极开展生产自救，目前灾荒业已停止发展。现我们仍继续努力，贯彻中央生产救灾指示，领导群众进行各种副业生产，抓紧春耕并以有效办法解决灾区军属土地代耕问题，以战胜春荒。谨以此告慰全国人民！
    此致敬礼
                            河北省人民政府  三月十七日
