　　Central People's Government Uniformly Dispatches Surplus Grain from Various Regions
    Supporting East China Disaster Areas with 400 Million Jin of Grain
    Shanghai Regularly Stores Over 500 Million Jin of Grain
    [This newspaper Shanghai, 3rd dispatch] Under the overall planning and unified dispatch of the Central People's Government, the grain transfer work from several provinces and regions nationwide, using surplus grain to support Shanghai and the disaster areas of East China, is proceeding smoothly. By the end of March, the grain transferred to Shanghai had reached one-half of the planned figure. It is now ensured that Shanghai regularly stores more than 500 million jin of grain. The grain transported from various provinces and regions to the disaster areas of East China has also reached more than 400 million jin. The gradual completion of this task will enable Shanghai and the disaster areas of East China to obtain an adequate supply of grain, which will have a significant impact on further stabilizing commodity prices in cities such as Shanghai. The dispatch range includes more than ten provinces and regions, including Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, Northeast, Shandong, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. In order to complete this large and arduous transportation task, the East China Region established the East China Region Grain Dispatch Committee and, under the Grain Committee, established the East China Grain Dispatch Headquarters. Various provinces and regions also simultaneously established grain transportation headquarters or grain transportation offices. Under the East China Headquarters, there are also offices or receiving stations in Hankou, Nanchang, Changsha, Yichang, Chongqing, and Kaifeng, as well as the Shanhaiguan Receiving Station. They are directly responsible for receiving grain concentrated from various locations or passing through these areas. To complete this task, the East China Grain Dispatch Headquarters dispatched more than 3,000 cadres to work in various provinces. The grain transportation method is as follows: first, each province organizes the people's labor to transport the grain to designated concentration points along the transportation lines, and then the East China Grain Dispatch Headquarters transports the grain to Shanghai. To prevent grain loss and consumption, in addition to equipping strong cadres for escort, a considerable number of armed escorts are also equipped. The personnel participating in the grain transportation work are extremely hardworking. In the rural areas, farmers use methods such as carrying on their shoulders and pushing by hand to overcome the difficulties of inconvenient transportation and lack of transportation tools, and promptly concentrate the grain on the transportation lines. The transportation personnel on various transportation lines also work diligently day and night to ensure the on-time completion of the grain transportation plan. In this work, due to the extremely large task and the lack of experience and sufficient cadres, some shortcomings have also occurred. For example, during the escort, due to insufficient storage work, there have been incidents of grain being robbed or stolen; due to insufficient prior preparation, there is a lack of warehouses, so that grain cannot be quickly put into storage, resulting in some grain being soaked by rain and becoming moldy; most of the existing warehouses are temporary warehouses borrowed to store industrial products, and many facilities are not suitable for storing grain, etc. These shortcomings still need to be quickly improved.

### 中央人民政府统一调度各地余粮  支援华东灾区粮达四亿斤  上海经常存粮五亿斤以上

　　中央人民政府统一调度各地余粮
    支援华东灾区粮达四亿斤
    上海经常存粮五亿斤以上
    【本报上海三日讯】在中央人民政府通盘筹划和统一调度之下，全国若干省区以余粮支援上海及华东灾区的粮食调运工作，正在顺利进行中。至三月底，调到上海的粮食，已达计划数字的二分之一。现在已做到保证上海经常存粮五亿斤以上。各省区运往华东灾区的粮米，亦达四亿余斤。此一任务的逐步完成，足使上海及华东灾区获得充分的粮食供应，对进一步稳定上海等城市的物价，更有巨大的意义。调运范围，包括四川、江西、湖南、河南、东北、山东、皖北、皖南、苏北、苏南、浙江等十余省区。华东区为完成此一庞大而艰巨的运输任务，曾成立了华东区粮食调运委员会，并在粮食委员会下设立华东粮食调运指挥部，各省区亦同时成立运粮指挥部或运粮办事处。在华东区指挥部下，并设有汉口、南昌、长沙、宜昌、重庆、开封等办事处或接运处，及山海关接运站。直接负责接运各地集中或经过该处的粮食。为完成此一任务，华东粮食调运指挥部调派干部三千余人，分赴各省工作。运粮办法为：先由各省组织民力，将粮食运到交通线上各指定之集中地点，然后由华东粮食调运指挥部将粮食运到上海。为了防止粮食损失消耗，除了配备坚强干部押运外，并配备相当数量的押运武装。参加运粮工作的人员极为努力。在农村中，农民们用肩挑、手推等办法，克服了交通不便、运输工具缺乏的困难，及时将粮食集中到交通线上。各交通线的运输人员，亦日以继夜，辛勤工作，保证了粮食调运计划的按期完成。在这一工作中，由于任务极为巨大，又缺乏经验和足够的干部，也曾发生若干缺点。如在押运途中，因为保管工作作得不够，曾发生粮食被抢或被偷窃的现象；因事先准备不足，仓库缺乏，以致粮食不能迅速入仓，造成部分粮食被雨水淋湿，发生霉烂；现有仓库大多是临时借用储藏工业品的仓库，许多设备都不适合储藏粮食之用等。这些缺点尚须迅速改善。
