Chahar Province Resolves to Strengthen Forestry Protection
Chairman Zhang Su Reports to the Central People's Government, Makes a Profound Self-Criticism, and Guarantees the Implementation of Forestry Protection Policies

[From Our Newspaper in Chahar] Chairman Zhang Su of the Chahar Provincial People's Government has conducted a profound self-criticism regarding the repeated destruction of forests in Chahar Province, which has caused great losses to state property. On the 23rd of last month, he reported to the Central People's Government, requesting punishment. The report stated that due to insufficient attention to forest protection and lax management by governments at all levels in the province, incidents of burning and theft had occurred continuously in areas such as Ci'er Mountain in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City, the birch forest area behind Yanggao, the Jide Chaoyangzhen Forest Farm, and forest areas in Chongli, Longguan, and Huailai. In Ci'er Mountain, timber was stolen for as long as four months, with a total of 370 elm, poplar, and willow trees with a diameter at breast height of three to seven inches being felled, along with thousands of pounds of branches and shrubs. This was not discovered and stopped until the end of December last year. Furthermore, according to statistics from ten counties including Yanggao, Yangyuan, and Zhuolu over the past year, there were as many as 69 instances of various types of forest destruction, with the area of forest destroyed being more than twice the area planted in the same year.

The report pointed out that the main reason for the continuous forest destruction incidents over the past year was the lack of a high degree of conscious awareness of cherishing state property. After the New China News Agency criticized the destruction incident at the Pangjiabao Mine last August, the province became clearer about the protection and management of industry and mining, but paid very little attention to agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The provincial government lacked regular education for its subordinate government personnel on forest protection policies; policies related to the development and protection of forestry were limited to issuing documents or conveying them at meetings, and rarely sent people to go deep into forest areas to conduct specific inspections, or only satisfied themselves with the masses formulating their own forest protection covenants, neglecting professional leadership, resulting in a passive performance in forest protection work, and the failure to universally implement forest protection policies. The trees in Victory Park in Zhangjiakou City were repeatedly climbed and broken by the masses who came here for meetings. Although the provincial government had repeatedly notified the municipal government to inspect and strengthen forest protection education, it never sent personnel to personally inspect and determine effective measures based on the actual situation. Although personnel were sent to inspect after the Ci'er Mountain incident and administrative punishments were imposed on the relevant personnel, it still failed to conduct education seriously and solve the problem ideologically.

In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, the report believes that in addition to severely handling destruction cases to educate cadres and the masses, and requesting the central government to give due punishment, the provincial government also needs to carry out the following tasks: (1) Through various organizational systems and using various publicity methods, deeply publicize and implement forest protection policies, and train 50 professional forest protection cadres to carry out forest protection work such as determining forest rights, issuing forest timber certificates, setting up firebreaks, and cleaning up forest farms in major forest areas such as Hengshan, Xiaowutai Mountain, Dameituo, and Chongli. (2) Strengthen forest protection leadership: establish and strengthen forestry management agencies in various important forest areas, and mobilize the masses through village representative meetings to protect forests. In addition, the provincial government will organize forest protection inspection teams to go deep into forest areas for inspection, so that forest protection work is strictly implemented. (3) Investigate the situation and take the initiative to control logging operations, striving to initially grasp the timber reserves in major forest areas and the amount of timber used by major mines and the three cities of Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong in 1950, and formulate a logging and supply plan, striving to take the initiative to control it and prevent indiscriminate felling. (4) Conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee on March 14 that "all state-owned forests are not allowed to be felled by agencies, troops, private individuals, or groups" and the provincial government's interim measures for logging. Jointly issue an order with the military region to eliminate all occurrences of destructive phenomena.

　　爱护祖国人民财产
    接受赐儿山等地林木破坏的教训
    察省决加强护林工作
    张苏主席向中央人民政府报告深刻检讨保证贯彻护林政策
    【本报察哈尔讯】察哈尔省人民政府张苏主席就察省林木屡遭破坏，使国家财产受到极大损失，进行深刻检讨；并于上月二十三日报告中央人民政府请求处分。报告中称：该省由于各级政府对保护山林重视不够，放松管理，致张家口市郊赐儿山、阳高桦林背林区、纪德朝阳镇林场，崇礼、龙关、怀来等地林区连续发生烧毁和偷盗事件。其中赐儿山林木被盗达四个月之久，共砍伐胸径三至七寸之榆、杨、柳树三百七十株，树枝及灌木丛数千斤，直至去年十二月底，才被发觉制止。又据去年一年来阳高、阳原、涿鹿等十县统计，各种林木破坏竟达六十九次，破坏林木面积竟较同年种植面积大过两倍。报告指出一年来陆续发生林木破坏事件的主要原因，是由于对国家财产缺乏高度的爱护自觉性。去年八月，新华社批评庞家堡矿场破坏事件之后，该省对工矿业保护管理较前明确，但对农林畜牧业注意很差。省府对所属各级政府人员缺乏经常性的护林政策的教育；有关林业的发展保护政策，仅止于下达文件或开会传达，很少派人深入林区进行具体检查，或只满足于群众自定护林公约，忽视专业领导，致使护林工作表现被动，护林政策未能普遍贯彻。张家口市胜利公园之树木几次被来此开会的群众攀折，省府虽几次通知市府检查并加强护林教育，但从未派员亲往检查，根据实际情况定出有效办法；赐儿山事件发生后虽派员检查，并对有关人员进行了行政处分，但仍未能严肃地进行教育，并从思想上解决问题。为使今后不再发生类似事件，报告中认为：除严肃处理破坏案件，以教育干部和群众、并请求中央给以应得处分外，省府还需进行以下工作：（一）通过各种组织系统，运用各种宣传方式，深入宣传贯彻护林政策，并训练五十名护林专业干部，在恒山、小五台山、大梅陀、崇礼等主要林区，进行确定林权，发林木证，设防火线，清扫林场等护林工作。（二）加强护林领导：在各重要林区设立并充实林业专管机构，通过村代表会发动群众，保护林木。另由省府组织护林检查组，深入林区进行检查，使护林工作严格执行。（三）调查情况，主动掌握采伐作业，争取于一九五○年内将主要林区林木之蓄积量，各大矿山及张、宣、大三市之用材量，初步掌握起来，制定伐采需给计划，力争主动掌握，防止滥伐乱伐。（四）认真执行中央财经委员会三月十四日“凡国有森林一律不准机关、部队、私人、团体采伐”的指示，及省府的采伐暂行办法。会同军区共同下令，杜绝一切破坏现象的发生。
