Regarding the Health and Seriousness of Advertising
    A Response to Yang Hongxian's Suggestion

To the Editor:
    I believe that advertising in newspapers and on the radio should never be treated merely as a purely commercial business. People's news undertakings should treat advertising as a political task! We must never indiscriminately publish or broadcast any advertisement, regardless of its content, as long as we are paid. We must have a serious and responsible attitude towards advertising, going through careful and rapid screening procedures. Any advertisement that is harmful to the people or not entirely appropriate must be resolutely rejected, or we must reserve the right to modify it, in order to establish the health and seriousness of advertising. We should not worry that doing so will affect our advertising business. This will not reduce or hinder the source of advertisements; on the contrary, it will enhance the value and credibility of advertising, enabling readers to gain education from advertisements and further trust the newspaper, making legitimate businesses more willing to advertise. In the "Readers' Letters" column of the Guangming Daily on March 20th, a student from Tsinghua University pointed out the phenomenon of certain newspapers in Shanghai indiscriminately publishing obscene advertisements. This is a widespread and serious fact, and it should be reformed immediately.
            Yang Hongxian

Mr. Yang Hongxian:
    Regarding your opinion on the advertising business of newspapers and radio, the "News Work" group of this newspaper will reply as follows:
    Your opinion is correct. The National Newspaper Managers Conference in December of last year made the following resolution on the issue of newspaper advertising: "Advertising is necessary in current urban newspapers. Urban newspapers should proactively publish advertisements that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in appropriate positions, in order to promote production and cultural undertakings, and serve the daily needs of the people, while also increasing the financial income of the newspaper. However, newspaper offices should review the content of advertisements and appropriately limit the length of advertisements. Private advertising agencies in large cities should be led in an appropriate manner." Currently, newspapers led by the Communist Party and people's radio stations in various regions generally select advertising content. Other newspapers generally pay more attention to the content of advertisements than in the past. The current shortcomings are, on the one hand, due to the inadequacies in the work of newspaper offices and radio stations, and on the other hand, because they cannot currently guarantee the complete accuracy of advertising content. This requires the cooperation of various aspects of the government's work, and this type of work needs to be carried out step by step.

### 关于广告的健康性与严肃性  答杨宏諴建议

　　关于广告的健康性与严肃性
    答杨宏諴建议编辑同志：
    我认为报纸和广播中的广告业务，决不应该只当作一件纯营业性业务来处理，人民的新闻事业应该把广告也当作政治任务来对待！我们决不可不管什么广告，什么内容，只要给钱就登，给钱就播。我们对广告要有严肃的负责态度，经过慎重而又迅速的甄审手续。凡有害于人民或有未尽妥善的广告，必须坚决拒登，或保有修改权，以建立广告的健康性与严肃性。我们不要顾虑这样一弄会影响我们广告营业，这决不会减少和妨碍广告来源；相反的，这更会增强广告价值和信誉，使读者能从广告中也得到教育而更加信赖报纸，使正当商业更愿意登广告。光明日报三月二十日读者来信栏中一位清华的同学曾指出了上海某些报纸滥登诲淫广告的现象，这是一个普遍严重的事实，应该立即改革才好。
            杨宏諴杨宏諴君：
    你对报纸和广播的广告业务的意见，兹由本报“新闻工作”组编辑答复如下：
    你的意见是对的。去年十二月全国报纸经理会议对报纸广告问题曾有如下决议：“广告在目前的城市报纸上是必要的。城市报纸应当以适当地位主动地刊登有益于国计民生的广告，以推进生产和文化事业，并服务于人民群众的日常需要，同时也由此增加报社的财政收入。但报社应当审核广告内容，并适当地限制广告篇幅，对大城市中的私营广告社应以适当方法加以领导。”现在各地共产党领导的报纸和人民广播电台，对广告内容一般都是经过选择的，其他的报纸，一般地说也比过去注意广告的内容了。现在的缺点，一方面是因为报社和广播台的工作还有不足的地方，另一方面也因为它们现在还不能保证广告内容的完全确实。这需要政府各方面工作的配合，而这类工作是需要一步一步进行的。
