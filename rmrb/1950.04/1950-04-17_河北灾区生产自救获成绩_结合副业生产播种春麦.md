Hebei Disaster Areas Achieve Success in Production for Self-Relief
Combining Sideline Production with Sowing Spring Wheat

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the beginning of spring, various sideline productions in the disaster areas of Hebei have developed, with the fishing industry being the most active (due to the favorable season). Wen'an has adopted the method of "resting people but not resting *huo*" (fishing gear), fishing day and night in shifts. Fishermen in Ninghe and Baodi areas are respectively catching fish by setting weirs in deep water and building dikes in shallow water. In Qingxian County, the number of people engaged in managing fish in the four districts has increased by 120% compared to last winter. Due to the warming weather, which makes it difficult for saltpeter to crystallize, the Cangxian Special District proposed methods of sweeping the soil in the morning and placing the saltpeter in a cool place or washing it with cold water, which yielded great results. According to statistics from eight counties, 4.41 million catties of saltpeter were collected in one week. Seasonal industries such as horse mane rope, straw hat making, cattail fan making, cattail mat making, and willow weaving have all seen new developments. Local chopping straw teams, house building teams, adobe making, wall building teams, and kiln building teams are also beginning to organize. In addition, some areas are promoting the collection of firewood, digging of vegetable roots, and preparation for collecting wild vegetables and tree leaves. Disaster victims with good production have surpluses. In He Xin Zhuang village in Cangxian County, 115 out of 127 households are refining saltpeter. Before the saltpeter industry developed, they generally ate chaff and vegetables. Recently, only seven households still mix some wheat bran, and 91 households have surplus grain (six households have more than one bag of stored grain, 59 households have three to five *dou*, and 26 households have two to three *dou*). Seven women in Ji County have woven 400 straw hats, which can be exchanged for 1,200 catties of grain, and they plan to buy a donkey. Fishermen in Leting have benefited from production, and many households have already repaid their loans, with more than 7,000 catties of loans already repaid. While carrying out sideline production, attention is also being paid to spring sowing. People are organized to pull plows, people help livestock, and women and children go to the fields, which solves the problem of the lack of people and livestock in the disaster areas. The land of some famine-stricken households has also been sown with spring wheat through government-sponsored cultivation and neighbor-sponsored cultivation. As of mid-March, the Tianjin Special District had sown more than 410,000 *mu*, the heavily affected areas of the Tangshan Special District had sown more than 200,000 *mu*, and the Cangxian Special District had sown more than 90% according to plan.

　　河北灾区生产自救获成绩
    结合副业生产播种春麦
    【本报讯】入春以来，河北灾区各种副业生产，都有发展，其中以渔业（因正值有利季节）最为活跃。文安采取歇人不歇?（捕鱼用具）的办法，昼夜轮流下水捕鱼。宁、宝地区渔民分别在深处下箔浅处挡埝掏鱼。青县四个区治鱼者比去冬增加百分之一百二十。皮硝因天气渐暖，不易结晶，沧县专区提出早晨扫土把硝放在阴冷地方或用冷水把的办法，获得很大效果。据八个县统计，一周内收硝四四一万斤，一般谷雨前后即不能再进行熬硝，应时行业如马辫草草帽业、蒲扇业、蒲顿业、柳编业，都有新的开展。各地的铡草班、盖房班、脱坯、打墙班、打窑班也正开始组织。此外有些地区正在提倡拾柴、挖菜根及准备采野菜树叶等。生产好的灾民已有积余，沧县何辛庄一二七户有一一五户熬硝，硝业未开展前，一般都吃糠菜，近来只有七户尚掺些麦麸，九一户有余粮（存粮一口袋以上者六户，三斗至五斗者五十九户，二斗至三斗者二十六户。）蓟县七个妇女编草帽四百顶，可换粮一千二百斤，准备买一头驴子。乐亭渔民，生产得利，不少户已将贷款归还，已归还贷款七千余斤。在进行副业生产中，同时注意进行春种。并组织人拉犁，人帮畜，妇女儿童下地解决了灾区中人畜缺乏的困难。一些逃荒户的地，也在政府代种，邻居代种的情形下，耩上了春麦。截至三月中旬，天津专区已播种四十一万多亩，唐山专区重灾区已播种二十多万亩，沧县专区已按计划播种了百分之九十以上。（方）
