　　Zhao Zhenying Practices Thrift to Help His Family Overcome the Disaster

　　Zhao Zhenying, a civil servant at the Photography Studio of the Ministry of Public Security, has a family in a disaster area. To help his family overcome difficulties, he tries his best to be thrifty. Out of his monthly ration of fifty catties of millet, he buys goods to send home, except for essential expenses such as haircuts. Since November of last year, he has saved goods worth approximately two hundred catties of millet and sent them home, and he also bought half a share of public bonds. His spirit of saving to help with disaster relief is worthy of our learning.

　　赵振英厉行节约帮助家里渡灾荒
    公安部摄影室公务员赵振英，家在灾区。他为了帮助家庭克服困难，便尽力节约，每个月五十斤小米的包干费，他除了理发等必需费用外，都买成实物送回家去。从去年十一月起，他已节约了约值二百余斤小米的实物送回家去，还买了半分公债。他这种节约救灾的精神，是值得我们学习的。
