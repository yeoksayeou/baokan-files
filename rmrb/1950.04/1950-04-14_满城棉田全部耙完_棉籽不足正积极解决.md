　　Man City Cotton Fields All Harrowed
    Cottonseed Shortage Being Actively Resolved
    [This Newspaper's Report] Farmers in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, after universally formulating specific accounting of household production plans, broke through the ideological concerns about being afraid to grow cotton, and their farming enthusiasm was greatly improved. Now all 120,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have been rolled and harrowed. Song Luoxue, a labor model in Songjia Village, District One of the county, first used specific accounting and practical examples to break through the farmers' ideological concerns about being afraid that "if more cotton is grown, grain will be expensive," and encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for growing more cotton, changing the original farming plan. Shouleng Village, a cotton-producing area in the county, planted only 13 qing of cotton last year; this year, after formulating household production plans and specific accounting, the village plans to plant 25 qing of cotton, accounting for more than 50 percent of the village's total cultivated land area. Currently, the county's 120,000 mu cotton planting plan has become the actual action of the county's farmers. As of March 16, all 120,000 mu of cotton fields in the county had been rolled once with stone rollers and harrowed twice, and 11,000 mu of bare land had also been cultivated.
    Although the county's cotton planting preparation work has achieved significant results, due to the flooding of more than 60 villages in the second and third districts last year, the cotton harvest was very poor; this year, the masses want to grow more cotton, but there is a shortage of seeds. Currently, the county's supply and marketing cooperative and other production leading departments, in addition to mobilizing farmers to exchange and borrow from each other to solve part of the problem, are trying to buy back a large number of high-quality cotton seeds from other counties to meet the needs of farmers.

　　满城棉田全部耙完
    棉籽不足正积极解决
    【本报讯】河北省满城县农民，经过普遍制订家庭生产计划的具体算账，打破了怕种棉花的思想顾虑，耕作情绪大为提高，现全县十二万亩棉田已全部磙、耙完毕。该县一区宋贾村劳动模范宋洛学，首先利用具体算账和实际例子，打通了农民害怕“种棉多了，粮食要贵”的思想顾虑，鼓舞了农民多种棉花的积极性，改变了原来的耕作计划。该县产棉区守陵村去年仅种棉十三顷；今年经过制订户生产计划和具体算账，全村计划种棉二十五顷，占该村总耕地面积的百分之五十以上。现该县十二万亩种棉计划，已成为全县农民的实际行动。三月十六日为止，全县十二万棉田，已用石磙轧一遍，耙盖两遍，白茬地一万一千亩亦已耕完。
    该县的种棉准备工作虽有显著成绩，但因去年二、三两区有六十余村被水淹，棉花收成很坏；今年群众想多种棉花，但缺乏种籽。现该县供销社和其他生产领导部门，除发动农民互换互借解决一部分外，正设法到外县买回大批优良棉籽，满足农民需要。
