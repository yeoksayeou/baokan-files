[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Over ten thousand households in Beijing have already paid their industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949. As of the 10th, in the past ten days, over fourteen thousand five hundred industrial and commercial households have paid their taxes, with the amount reaching over 5.17 billion RMB (an additional 348 households paid in kind with rice coupons, totaling over 132,000 catties of rice).

[Another Dispatch] Industrial and commercial households within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Tax Bureau are actively paying taxes. As of the 10th, over four thousand one hundred industrial and commercial households in the branch had paid their taxes, with the amount reaching over 1.47 billion RMB, and rice coupons equivalent to over 19,000 catties of rice, exceeding the branch's original ten-day tax collection plan by over two thousand four hundred households and 660 million RMB.

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In light of the fact that tax evasion and avoidance are still serious problems in Beijing, and in order to ensure that national financial revenue is not lost and to ensure that the burden on industrial and commercial operators is fair and reasonable, the Beijing Tax Bureau has decided to conduct targeted tax inspections in the city from the 14th of this month to the end of the month. The inspections will focus on whether businesses are paying taxes on goods, stamp duties, business taxes, and private alcohol sales in accordance with regulations and on time. Personnel performing the inspection will wear temporary armbands, which will be white with blue edges and blue characters, with the five large characters "Tax Inspection Certificate" and the smaller characters "Jing Zi No. ×", and stamped with the official seal of the Municipal Tax Bureau.
