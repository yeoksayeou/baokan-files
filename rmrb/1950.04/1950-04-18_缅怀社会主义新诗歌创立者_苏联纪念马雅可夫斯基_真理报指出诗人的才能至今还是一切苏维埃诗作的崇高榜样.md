    Soviet Union Commemorates Mayakovsky
    Pravda Points Out the Poet's Talent Remains a Lofty Example for All Soviet Poetry
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] Comprehensive report from TASS: The Soviet people commemorated the 20th anniversary of the death of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky on the 14th. The poet's residence in Moscow was renovated and opened on the 14th, displaying memorabilia, paintings, and editions of the poet's published works.
    Pravda published an editorial stating: Mayakovsky dedicated himself entirely to the lofty struggle of the working people for communism. He vividly expressed the brilliant thoughts and achievements of our Soviet era in his poetry, thus becoming the founder of new socialist poetry. The artistic images created by Mayakovsky demonstrate the great role of the Bolshevik Party in the life of the Soviet people and the struggle for communism. This talent remains a lofty example for all Soviet poetry today.
    The famous Soviet poet Tikhonov published a commemorative article in Izvestia stating: Mayakovsky's poetry has had a great influence on the development of all progressive literature in the world. His works have been translated into twenty-four foreign languages, and poets in people's democratic countries are learning from Mayakovsky how to serve the people and the cause of socialism.
