　　Chahar Province's Eighteen Cities and Counties
    Hold Youth League Representative Assemblies
    [Report from this newspaper] Following the conclusion of the Chahar Province Youth League Representative Assembly on March 1st, Xuanhua City and seventeen counties including Shangyi, Yingxian, and Tianzhen also successively convened Youth League Representative Assemblies. They conveyed the resolutions of the Provincial League Representative Assembly, discussed the League building work of the past year and future plans based on the actual conditions of their localities, and formally elected the city and county leadership organizations of the League. Some counties also conducted award ceremonies or selected model individuals at the representative assemblies. At the Youth League representative meetings in Yanqing, Wan'an and other counties, leading cadres went deep into the grassroots and participated in group discussions, enabling the League's leadership organs to discover many problems that were previously unknown. Some places also invited some non-League youth and young Party members from villages without League branches to attend the conference as non-voting delegates, thus soliciting opinions more broadly from all parties. Various localities also solved many problems in their work based on their actual conditions. Some counties also learned some agricultural knowledge such as seed soaking and tree planting at the meetings, which greatly promoted scientific knowledge. For example, after the representative from Beiguan Village in Yanqing who attended the League Representative Assembly returned to the village, they immediately carried out publicity and brewing by area, mobilizing thirty-two League members to carry out seed soaking, and also drove a part of the masses.

　　察省十八市县
    举行青年团代表会
    【本报讯】察哈尔省青年团代表大会于三月一日结束后，宣化市和尚义、应县、天镇等十七个县亦相继召开了青年团代表大会，传达了省团代大会决议，并根据本地实际情况，讨论了过去一年的建团工作和今后的计划，并正式选举了团的市、县领导机构。有的县并在代表会上进行了评奖或评选模范等。在延庆、万安等县的青年团代表会议上，领导干部深入下层，参加小组讨论，使团的领导机关发现了许多过去不知道的问题。有的地方还聘请了一些团外青年及未建团村庄的青年党员列席参加大会，这样更广泛地征求了各方意见。各地并根据当地实际情况，解决了工作中不少问题。有些县在会上还学了些浸种、植树等农业知识，对推广科学知识作用很大。如延庆北关村参加团代大会的代表回村后，即分片进行宣传酝酿，发动了三十二个团员进行了浸种，还带动了一部分群众。（刘林之、任贵儒）
