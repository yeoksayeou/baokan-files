The Youth League organizations and members, scattered throughout the vast countryside, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have united and educated the broad masses of rural youth. In last year's agricultural production and production self-salvation movement, many examples of promoting and organizing production have emerged.

Responding to the Call to Organize and Unite the Masses for Mutual Aid

In mutual aid and cooperation, Youth League members in various regions first responded to the call of the People's Government and the Communist Party to organize. In areas with an existing organizational foundation, League members and the masses participated in mutual aid organizations together. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen counties in northern Shaanxi, 3,467 League members and 27,188 people organized 4,152 labor exchange teams. In areas where the general public was not yet accustomed to organizing production, Youth League members were often the initiators or earliest participants in labor mutual aid organizations. For example, in 804 villages in Chahar South, most of the 2,474 work teams were initially organized and participated in by League members, before expanding to the broader masses.

In the face of insufficient draft animal power, League members in many regions organized to pull plows with manpower for plowing in the autumn. According to statistics from the Chahar South Special District, 4,894 League members from 499 villages participated in this movement, driving 39,565 people to cultivate 190,259 mu of land, which was praised by all sectors of Chahar Province and the leadership. In many villages in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, autumn plowing was increased by one or two rounds due to the organization of human-powered plows. In terms of increasing fertilizer, League members used their own active actions to mobilize the masses to accumulate fertilizer. For example, the Communist Party branch of Yushuping Village in Licheng, Shanxi Province, called for applying 30 to 35 loads of fertilizer per mu. The Youth League branch responded first. Under the leadership of the Party branch, 36 League members launched extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses, creating a mass upsurge of collecting manure, smoking fertilizer, and pressing fertilizer. After forty days, the summary showed that League members had accumulated 6,300 loads of fertilizer, reaching 35 loads per mu; the masses had averaged 30 loads of fertilizer per mu.

Promoting Science and Technology and Leading the Masses in Planting Trees

In learning and promoting new agricultural science knowledge, implementing seed selection, seed soaking, and autumn and winter tree planting, many League members first conducted experiments, set examples, and then promoted them to the broader masses. For example, League members in Tianjiazhuang Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province, created a method of marking good cotton bolls before seed selection to facilitate selection, which led the entire village to adopt it, selecting 120 jin of pure and good cotton seeds. The Youth League branch of Chengguan 1st Street in Liangxiang, Hebei Province, planted two types of cotton seeds, soaked and unsoaked, in a flower pot. After they grew, they took the flower pot to the street for publicity. Everyone saw that the soaked seeds sprouted earlier and grew stronger; the unsoaked seeds sprouted later and unevenly. Therefore, most people implemented seed soaking. The masses in the north have never had the habit of planting trees in autumn and winter. The 33 League members of Baishaling Village patiently mobilized more than 60 young people to plant 8,000 trees on 40 mu of land in six days, two-thirds of which survived, influencing the masses to participate in afforestation. According to incomplete statistics from 16 counties including Liangxiang in Hebei and Wutai in Shanxi, and 9 villages in Chahar South, a total of 9,522,591 trees were planted in autumn and winter under the leadership of League members. Some Youth League branches in Wanping also created "Youth Forests."

Organizing Saltpeter Boiling and Textile Production to Promote Production and Disaster Relief

In winter production and disaster relief, many Youth League members took the lead, actively participating in and leading the masses. For example, in Liushiyintun Village, Qing County, Hebei Province, League members first successfully experimented with boiling saltpeter, and then contacted the supply and marketing cooperative to arrange sales. While boiling saltpeter, they promoted it, dispelling the masses' concerns that "it cannot be boiled, there is no market." More than 90% of the 220 households in the village participated in boiling saltpeter. According to statistics from 347 villages in Cangxian and Tianjin Special Districts of Hebei, under the leadership of 1,851 League members, 2,784 young people were organized to boil saltpeter. In about one month of December last year, a total of 410,643 jin of saltpeter was produced, which could be exchanged for 128,326 jin of millet, partially solving the living difficulties of the masses. Some farmers who were preparing to move did not move, and beggars also participated in production.

In organizing women's textile production, League members also achieved significant results. According to statistics from 21 districts and 107 villages in three counties including Renqiu, Hebei Province, 542 female League members led 577 young women to participate in textile production.

A Large Number of Outstanding Youths Elected as Heroes and Models

In these movements, many outstanding young labor heroes, production models, and model mutual aid groups emerged. For example, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, selected 176 labor heroes and production models when summarizing production, of which 36 were young people (15 League members). Five of the seven young people elected as county labor heroes were League members. In Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, 348 League members participated in 114 mutual aid groups, and 123 were elected as the heads or deputy heads of the mutual aid groups.

A Few Experiences and Lessons

In organizing and educating League members and youth to participate in the production movement last year, the following experiences and lessons are worth mentioning: First, to organize youth production, League members should be at the core, uniting the broad masses of youth and adults to carry out labor exchange and mutual assistance, and pay attention to learning technology from experienced farmers. Some work teams are composed solely of League members or young people, without being with adults, and even disconnected from family production. This will inevitably hinder the rapid improvement of youth in farming techniques, and also make it impossible for the work team to persist and consolidate. In the future, the League's leadership agencies in various regions should consciously guide youth mutual aid groups in the direction of mixed development with adults. Second, the League's various activities should be centered on production, and regular research and review should be conducted, paying attention to appropriate praise and criticism. In this way, the content of the League's life will be enriched and active. Third, in learning and promoting new scientific and technological methods, some young people, after accepting new farming methods, do not actively promote them through various organizations or adopt various methods, but remain in individuals or one family, and have not developed into a mass movement, which should be changed. Fourth, setting good plans for the Youth League branch and League members in production, launching challenge competitions between individuals and individuals, groups and groups, and encouraging everyone's emotions are effective ways to improve production efficiency. However, in some places, the Youth League branch comes forward to challenge and compete with the Youth Federation, the Women's Federation, and even the Party branch, which is not right.

　　在生产战线上的农村青年团
    分布在广大农村的青年团组织和青年团员，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结教育了广大的农民青年，在去年的农业生产和生产自救运动中，涌现了许多推动生产和组织生产的范例。
    响应组织起来团结群众互助
    在互助合作中，各地青年团首先响应人民政府和共产党组织起来的号召，在已有组织基础的地区，团员们和群众在一起参加互助组织。据陕北十三个县不完全的统计，有三千四百六十七个团员和二万七千一百八十八个群众共同组织了四千一百五十二个变工队。而在一般群众对组织起来进行生产尚不习惯的地区，青年团员常是劳动互助组织的发起人或最先参加者。如察南八百零四个村的二千四百七十四个拨工组，大部分是团员首先组织参加，然后发展到广大群众中的。
    在畜力不足的情况下，去秋不少地区，团员们组织起来以人力拉犁耕地。据察南专区统计，四百九十九个村庄，有四千八百九十四名团员参加了这一运动，并带动了三万九千五百六十五个群众，耕地十九万零二百五十九亩，受到察省各界的称赞和领导上的表扬。山西省长治专区有不少村庄因组织了人拉犁，秋耕增加了一遍或两遍。在增加肥料上，团员们以自己的积极行动来动员广大群众积肥，如山西省黎城榆树平村中共支部号召每亩上肥三十驮至三十五驮。团支部首先响应，三十六个团员在党支部领导下向群众展开了广泛深入的宣传，造成群众性的拾粪、熏粪、压肥热潮。四十天后总结，团员共积肥六千三百驮，已达到每亩上粪三十五驮；群众平均都达到每亩上粪三十驮。
    推广科学技术带动群众植树
    在学习与推广新的农业科学知识，推行选种、浸种、秋冬植树等工作中，许多团员首先进行试验，作出榜样，然后向广大群众推广。如河北束鹿县田家庄团员创造了选种前把好棉花桃子记上记号，以便利选种的方法，带动全村采用，选出了一百二十斤纯良的棉种。河北良乡城关一街团支部用一个花盆种上浸与未浸的两种棉种，长出后将花盆端到街里宣传。大家看见浸过的出苗早，长得壮；没浸过的出苗迟，又不齐，因此大部群众都实行了浸种。北方群众素来没有秋冬植树的习惯，白沙岭村三十三个团员耐心地动员了六十多个青年在六天内种了四十亩，栽树八千棵，活了三分之二，影响群众也参加了造林。据河北良乡、山西五台等十六个县和察南九个村的不完全统计，在团员带动下，秋冬植树共九百五十二万二千五百九十一棵。宛平有的团支部还造了“青年林”。
    组织熬硝纺织推动生产救灾
    在冬季生产救灾中，许多青年团员以身作则，积极参加并带动了群众。如河北省的青县刘世印屯村，团员首先试验熬硝成功后，又到供销社接洽好销路，一面熬硝，一面宣传，打消了群众“熬不成，无销路”的顾虑。全村二百二十户中，百分之九十以上参加了熬硝。据河北的沧县、天津两专区三百四十七个村统计，在一千八百五十一名团员的带动下，先后组织了二千七百八十四名青年熬硝，去年十二月一个月左右共出硝四十一万零六百四十三斤，可换十二万八千三百二十六斤小米，部分地解决了群众的生活困难。有些准备搬家的农民不搬了，要饭的也参加生产了。
    在组织妇女纺织方面，团员们也有显著成绩。据河北省任邱等三个县，二十一个区、一百零七个村统计，即有女团员五百四十二名带动了五百七十七名青年妇女参加纺织。
    大批优秀青年当选英雄模范
    在这些运动中，涌现出不少优秀的青年劳动英雄、生产模范和模范互助小组。如山西左权县在总结生产时选出一百七十六个劳动英雄和生产模范，其中有三十六个是青年（团员十五人）。当选县劳动英雄的七个青年中即有团员五人。山西阳城县三百四十八名团员参加在一百一十四个互助组里，有一百二十三人被选为互助组的正副小组长。
    几点经验教训
    在去年组织教育团员与青年参加生产运动中，有以下几点经验教训值得提出：一、组织青年生产，要以团员为核心，团结广大青年与成年人一道去进行变工互助，并注意向有经验的农民学习技术。有的拨工组单独由团员或青年组成，而不和成年人一道，甚至有和家庭生产脱节的现象，这样，势必妨碍青年在耕作技术上的迅速提高，也使拨工组不能坚持巩固。各地团的领导机关今后应有意识地将青年互助组引向与成年混合的方向发展。二、团的各种活动，应以生产为中心进行，并经常研究检讨，注意适当的表扬与批评。这样，团的生活内容才会充实，活跃。三、在学习与推行新的科学技术中，有的青年接受了新的农作法后，不积极通过各种组织、采用各种方法推广，停留在个人或一个家庭中，未发展成群众运动，这是应该改变的。四、在生产中订好团支部与团员的计划，发动个人与个人、组与组的挑战竞赛，鼓励大家情绪，是提高生产效率的有效方法之一。但有的地方由团支部出面，与青联会、妇联会，甚至与党支部挑战竞赛，这种作法是不对的。
