　　Strictly Enforce Cash Management
    The State Council of the Central People's Government announced the "Decision on Implementing Cash Management for State Organs" on the 7th. This is an important measure to improve the nation's financial and economic situation, and it will have a positive effect on regulating cash circulation, saving cash usage, and stabilizing currency value.
    Since the State Council issued the "Decision on Unifying Financial and Economic Work" on March 3, stipulating that "all cash from military and government organs and public enterprises, except for a certain amount for immediate use, should be deposited in the National Bank," in the past month, the deposit figures of the People's Bank of China have reached 60 percent of the total currency issued. This has enabled the state to control a large amount of cash without increasing currency issuance, which can be used for the planned adjustment of fiscal expenditures, and thus has played a significant role in stabilizing currency value and prices during this period.
    Now, the State Council of the Central People's Government has announced the "Decision on Implementing Cash Management for State Organs." It more clearly stipulates that: all public enterprises, organs, troops, and cooperatives, etc., in places where there are branches of the People's Bank of China, the amount of cash they keep themselves should generally not exceed three days of daily expenses, and the rest must be deposited in the local People's Bank of China or its entrusted institutions; for transactions between each other, except for the issuance of wages, purchases from rural areas, and sporadic expenses in cities that must use cash, People's Bank of China checks should be used, and cash payments should not be made. As long as we strictly implement these regulations, the deposits of our National Bank will greatly increase; our cash usage will be greatly saved. Therefore, our financial and economic situation may be even better than it is now. Therefore, we ask all public enterprises, organs, troops, and cooperatives to work hard to realize this decision.

　　严格执行现金管理
    中央人民政府政务院七日公布了《关于实行国家机关的现金管理的决定》。这是改善国家财政经济状况的一个重要措施，对于调节现金流通、节约现金使用以及稳定币值等，都将会产生良好的效果。
    自从政务院在三月三日发布的《关于统一财政经济工作的决定》内，规定“一切军政机关和公营企业的现金，除留若干近期使用者外，一律存入国家银行”之后，一个月来，中国人民银行的存款数字，已达到了货币全部发行量的百分之六十。这样就使得国家不必增加货币发行，就可以掌握大量的现金，作为有计划地调剂财政支出之用，因而对这时期的币值与物价的稳定，起了重大作用。
    现在，中央人民政府政务院又公布了《关于实行国家机关的现金管理的决定》。它更明确地规定了：一切公营企业、机关、部队及合作社等，在设有中国人民银行机构的地方，自己保存的现金数目，一般不得超过三天的日常开支，其余必须存入当地中国人民银行或其委托机构；相互间往来，除发放工资、向农村采购及在城市零星开支等必须使用现金者外，均应使用人民银行支票，不得以现金支付。只要我们严格执行这些规定，我们的国家银行的存款将更会大大增加；我们的现金使用将会大大节省。因而我们的财政经济状况也就有可能比现在更为改善。因此，我们要求所有一切公营企业、机关、部队及合作社，都要为实现这一决定而努力。
