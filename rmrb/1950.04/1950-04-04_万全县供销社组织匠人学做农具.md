　　Wanquan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Organizes Artisans to Learn to Make Farm Tools
    [This News Report] According to the March 28th issue of the Chahar Daily: The Wanquan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is organizing handicraft workers to learn how to manufacture farm tools. There are two blacksmith shops, one foundry, and one carpentry shop in the city. The blacksmiths only knew how to make horseshoes, and the carpenters only knew how to make cabinets, boxes, etc., and none of them knew how to make farm tools. In order to vigorously support the farm tool manufacturing industry, the county supply and marketing cooperative invited fourteen blacksmith shops from Hunyuan County. In addition to manufacturing farm tools according to the contract, they also taught the blacksmiths in the city how to make farm tools and take on apprentices. In order to fully supply farmers with plowshares, the supply and marketing cooperative also signed a contract with a foundry to order one thousand plowshares, paying them one thousand catties of rice and five thousand catties of coal in advance. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperative is also preparing to organize carpenters to learn how to make plow beams.

　　万全县供销社组织匠人学做农具
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报三月二十八日讯：万全县供销社，组织手工业工人学习制造农具。该城内有铁匠炉两处、翻砂厂一处、木匠铺一座。铁匠只会打马掌，木匠只会作柜子、箱子等，都不会作农具。县供销社为了大量扶植农具制造业，从浑源县请来十四家铁匠炉，除按合同制造农具外，并教给城内铁匠学制农具，带徒弟。为了充分供给农民犁铧，供销社又与一户翻砂厂订合同，订购铧子一千个，先付米一千斤、煤五千斤。此外，供销社还准备组织木匠学习作犁杖。
