　　Xinhua News Agency Report: Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, and Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, issued statements regarding the Japanese reactionaries' abuse and killing of captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers:

　　Comrade Feng Wenbin said: The Japanese reactionaries, on the eve of their surrender, massacred large numbers of captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers, once again exposing their inhumane crimes. During the invasion of China, Japan continuously transported Chinese youth and captured soldiers to Japan, most of whom subsequently disappeared. We have ample reason to believe that the Hanaoka Mine Massacre is but one of many such tragedies. The Chinese youth and people cannot tolerate this brutality of the Japanese reactionaries and must thoroughly investigate and severely punish the perpetrators. These criminals, like the war criminals who invaded China, are being shielded and condoned by MacArthur. U.S. imperialism is attempting to support them to carry out another massacre of the Asian people. The Chinese youth and people resolutely oppose this measure by U.S. imperialism, which is hostile to the Asian people, and demand the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. At the same time, we must resolutely support the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the renewed aggression by Japan or any other country colluding with Japan in any form of aggression.

　　Comrade Liao Chengzhi said: The truth about the massive massacre of 416 captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers by Japanese reactionaries at the Hanaoka Mine in northern Honshu, as revealed by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese People's Daily, is only one of the countless monstrous crimes committed by Japanese reactionaries against the Chinese people. The Chinese people and Chinese youth have suffered from its devastation and trampling for many years, and millions of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have been killed. The Chinese people and Chinese youth will not forget this blood debt owed by Japanese imperialism and demand that it punish the murderers who killed the Chinese people.

　　These heinous Japanese reactionary fascist executioners should have been arrested and brought to justice after Japan's surrender in 1945 and sentenced to death in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. However, the U.S. government has shielded them in every possible way and openly colluded with the Japanese reactionaries to cover up the fascist executioners' atrocities of massacring the Chinese people. More recently, disregarding the condemnation of world public opinion, it has arbitrarily released important Japanese war criminals. This despicable and shameless act shows that those in power in the United States are willing to collude with the dregs of humanity and are determined to be enemies of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

　　U.S. imperialism attempts to occupy Japan militarily for a long time, turning Japan into a military base on the Pacific invasion line, plotting to launch a new war, and driving the Japanese people to become cannon fodder for attacking the Soviet Union and the Asian people.

　　We oppose the long-term military occupation of Japan by U.S. troops and oppose turning Japan into a military base for aggression. We demand the swift signing of a peace treaty with Japan, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and with the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, and the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Japan after the treaty is signed. We oppose the colonization of Japan and demand that Japan establish its own democratic government, becoming a truly independent country.

　　Comrade Xie Bangding said: The crimes of the Japanese reactionaries against the Chinese people are too numerous to count. From the "May 3rd," "May 30th," "September 18th," and "January 28th" incidents to the entire eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, how many Chinese youth and Chinese people died tragically at the hands of the Japanese bandits! The massive massacre of captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers by Japanese reactionaries on the eve of their surrender, as published by the Overseas Chinese People's Daily, is yet another exposure of the Japanese reactionaries' brutal crimes.

　　We solemnly declare: All Japanese war criminals, headed by Hirohito, must be severely punished! A peace treaty with Japan, signed by all countries that fought against Japan and guaranteeing peace in the East and the world, must be concluded as soon as possible! Only in this way can we prevent the resurgence of Japanese reactionary fascism and prevent the Chinese people and the people of the world from being brutally massacred again by the Japanese reactionaries!

　　We warn the Japanese reactionary authorities and the imperialists who collude with them: The Chinese people have stood up! All actions that harm the Chinese people will be subject to corresponding sanctions! All imperialists and their running dogs who妄想 (妄想 means delusion but is used here in a more derogatory context that suggests foolish intent) to provoke war and enslave the people of the world will reap what they sow!

    痛斥美帝包庇日寇罪行  要求严惩虐杀华俘凶犯
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬、中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志、中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定，对日本反动派虐杀被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人事发表谈话：
    冯文彬同志说：日本反动派在投降前夕，大批虐杀被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人，再一次揭露了他们的灭绝人道的罪行。日本在侵华期间，曾不断地从中国押送中国青年及被俘士兵到日本，以后大都下落不明。我们有充分理由相信，花冈矿山大惨案不过是许多惨案中的一件。对于日本反动派的这种暴行，中国青年和人民决不能容忍，必须彻底追究，严惩凶犯。现在这些凶犯，同侵华战犯一样，被麦克阿瑟所包庇、纵容。美帝国主义企图扶植他们，向亚洲人民进行再一次的大屠杀。中国青年和人民，坚决反对美帝国主义这种与亚洲人民为敌的措施，要求早日缔结对日和约，同时要坚决拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约，制止日本帝国主义者之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略。
    廖承志同志说：东京华侨民报所揭露的日本反动派在本州北部花冈矿山虐杀被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人四百十六人的大惨案真相，只不过是日本反动派对中国人民无数滔天罪行中的一件。中国人民和中国青年多年来受尽了它的摧残蹂躏，数百万中华民族的优秀儿女被杀害。中国人民和中国青年不会忘记日本帝国主义这笔血债，并要求它惩办杀害中国人民的凶手。
    这批罪大恶极的日本反动派法西斯刽子手们，本来早就应该在一九四五年日本投降以后，缉拿归案，根据波茨坦协定，依法判处死刑。然而，美国政府却百般包庇，且公然与日本反动派相互勾结，掩盖法西斯刽子手们屠杀中国人民的暴行，更于最近不顾世界舆论的谴责，擅自释放日本重要战犯。这种卑鄙无耻的举动说明了美国的当权者是不惜与人类渣滓勾结，决心与中国人民和世界人民为敌。
    美帝国主义企图长期军事占领日本，将日本变成太平洋侵略线上的军事基地，阴谋发动新的战争，驱使日本人民作为进攻苏联和亚洲人民的炮灰。
    我们反对美国军队长期占领日本，反对将日本变成一个军事侵略的根据地。我们要求迅速签订一个依照波茨坦协定而有中华人民共和国代表参加的对日和约，并在和约签订以后，从日本撤退一切占领军。我们反对将日本殖民地化而要求日本建立日本人民自己的民主政府，成为一个真正独立的国家。
    谢邦定同志说：日本反动派对中国人民的罪行是罄竹难书的。从“五三”、“五卅”、“九一八”、“一二八”一直到整整八年侵华战争，中国青年和中国人民惨死在日寇手中的何止千万！这次华侨民报所发表的日本反动派在投降前夕大批虐杀被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人大惨案，正是日本反动派残酷罪行的又一次暴露。
    我们严正声明：以裕仁为首的所有日本大小战犯必须得到严惩！一个由所有对日作战国家签订的保障东方和世界和平的对日和约必须早日缔结！这样才能够制止日本反动法西斯的死灰复燃，才能制止中国人民和全世界人民的再被日本反动派惨酷屠杀！
    我们警告日本反动当局及与之相勾结的帝国主义者：中国人民已经站立起来了！一切危害中国人民的行为，必将受到相应的制裁！一切妄想挑拨战争、奴役世界人民的帝国主义者和其走狗们，将自食其果！
