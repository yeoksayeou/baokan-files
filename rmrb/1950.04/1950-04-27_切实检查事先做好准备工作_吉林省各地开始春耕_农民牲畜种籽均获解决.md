Conscientiously Check Preparatory Work

Jilin Province Begins Spring Plowing

Farmers' Livestock and Seeds All Resolved

[Jilin News] Spring plowing preparations in Jilin Province have been completed, and spring land turning has begun in various areas. The province began spring plowing preparations in early February, dispatching a large number of cadres to rural areas to promote production. By mid-April, the province had completed 47% of this year's manure delivery task. Regarding seed selection and trial planting, the old liberated areas have been able to attach importance to it. Yushu County alone has run seed selection training classes for more than 400 people and carried out exchanges of good varieties in villages with a solid foundation. Farmers in various areas have a high demand for the use of new farm tools. It is estimated that more than 25,000 units can be promoted throughout the province. Yushu County alone will promote 10,000 units. The provincial government has notified all counties to quickly lend out farm tools. In order to solve farmers' difficulties, the province has issued 174 billion in agricultural loans, including loans for 23,426 farm tools, 5,430 head of draft and breeding livestock, 3,500 tons of fertilizer, and more than 46.6 billion yuan for other loans for paddy field greenhouse seedling raising and water conservancy. Cooperatives have played a significant role in preparing for spring plowing. According to statistics from twelve counties and two cities, cooperatives have helped farmers solve the value of living and production materials worth more than 465 billion yuan and helped farmers sell agricultural and sideline products worth more than 320 billion yuan. From last winter to this spring, the number of carts and horses purchased by the masses in various counties has been large. During the preparation for spring plowing in Changling County, 1,350 head of draft livestock were purchased and 72 carts were purchased. In order to prevent livestock from contracting diseases, various counties have successively launched spring epidemic prevention work, and newly adopted rabbit-adapted virus serum to inject cattle, which solved the difficulty of preventing cattle plague.

However, the following deviations have occurred and existed in the preparation for spring plowing: (1) Before March, cadres and the masses generally had a sense of satisfaction with the status quo and optimism, believing that the work was "guaranteed," and the recognition of new difficulties was insufficient. Therefore, the preparatory work was viewed more lightly than in previous years, which had become the biggest obstacle in the preparatory work. (2) Some district and village cadres and farmers do not have enough understanding of the policies and have concerns about developing production. This is manifested in the fact that 50% of farmers in the old liberated areas have risen to become middle peasants (of which 10% have risen to become well-to-do middle peasants), and they are unclear about whether they can lend money, hire workers, rent or buy and sell land. Organizing is the direction, but whether new rich peasants are allowed to exist is not only unclear to the masses, but also to most district and village cadres. Many middle peasants believe that production has "reached its limit," and it is enough to eat and use every year, so they are not motivated to produce. There are also great deviations in mutual aid and labor exchange. Some village cadres and the masses mistakenly believe that promoting and rewarding mutual aid means that organization is "not possible." Many places believe that achieving large groups is considered an achievement, which has led to coercive orders. In addition, the phenomenon of laissez-faire also exists, and they do not provide leadership in the organization of mutual aid. For example, in Nanhhuangdi Village in the Naihe Mountain Area of Jiaohe, only those with strong manpower and livestock were organized, leaving the families of soldiers and those lacking labor and livestock outside.

The provincial government has corrected the above deviations and has repeatedly explained various specific production policies at the labor model conference and the people's representative conference, focusing on conveying Chairman Gao Gang's report, pointing out ways to correct deviations and errors. Various counties and districts have also launched publicity and education through various meetings.

　　切实检查事先做好准备工作
    吉林省各地开始春耕
    农民牲畜种籽均获解决
    【吉林讯】吉林全省春耕准备工作已经完成，各地开始春翻地。该省于二月初即开始春耕准备工作，抽调大批干部下乡推动生产。四月中旬，全省已完成今年送粪任务百分之四十七。关于选种试种情况，老区都能重视，只榆树县就开办过四百多人的选种训练班，并在有基础的村庄进行了好品种的串换。各地农民对于使用新农具的要求很高，估计全省能推广两万五千多台，仅榆树县就要推广一万台。省府已通知各县，把农具赶快贷出。为了解决农民困难，全省发放一千七百四十亿的农贷，其中贷农具二万三千四百二十六台，耕畜与种畜五千四百三十匹，肥料三千五百吨，其他贷给水田温床育苗、水利等款四百六十六亿多元。合作社在准备春耕工作中，起了很大作用。据十二个县和二个市的统计，合作社帮助农民解决生活、生产物资价值四千六百五十多亿元，帮助农民推销农副业产品价值三千二百多亿元。从去冬到今春，各县群众购买车马的数目很大。长岭县在准备春耕中，买耕畜一千三百五十匹，买车七十二辆。为了防止耕畜发生疾病，各县先后展开春季防疫工作，新采用兔化毒血清给牛注射，解决了预防牛瘟的困难。
    但春耕准备工作中，还发生和存在下面的偏差：（一）三月以前在干部和群众中，普遍存在满足于现状和乐观的思想，认为工作有“保证”，对新的困难认识不够。因此，对准备工作看得比往年轻松，曾经成为准备工作中最大的妨碍。（二）有些区村干部与农民对政策不够了解，对发展生产有顾虑，表现在老区已有百分之五十的农民上升为中农（其中有百分之十上升为富裕中农），对于是否可以放贷、雇工、出租或买卖土地等认识不清。组织起来是方向，但是否允许新富农存在，不仅群众不摸底，大部区村干部思想也很模糊。不少中农认为生产“到了头”，够年吃年用就行，生产不起劲。在变工互助上，偏向也很大，有些村屯干部和群众把提倡奖励互助，误认为非组织“不行”。很多地方认为搞大组才算有成绩，而产生了强迫命令现象。此外，放任自流的现象也存在，在组织互助当中不去加以领导。如蛟河奶子山区南荒地村，只是人强马壮的组织起来了，把军属和缺乏劳力畜力的扔在外边。
    以上的偏差，省府已予纠正，先后在劳动模范大会、人民代表会上，以传达高岗主席报告为中心，反复讲明各种具体的生产政策，指出纠正偏向和错误的办法。各县区也通过了各种会议展开宣传教育。
