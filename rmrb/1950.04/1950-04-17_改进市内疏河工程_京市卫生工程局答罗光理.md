　　Improving the City's Dredging Project
    Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health responds to Luo Guangli

    Dear Editor Luo Guangli:

    Recently, Beijing has been dredging the city's rivers, which citizens are universally praising. However, I have also heard residents near the Wanshou Temple River saying, "Repairing the river is a good thing, but the repairs are not being done well. The government has spent so much money and should do a good job. If it continues like this, it's really not cost-effective." The main shortcoming reflected here is the failure to transport all the mud from the river to the levees, instead simply placing it on both sides of the riverbank. Now, some of these areas have begun to collapse back into the riverbed. If it rains, most of the mud will return to its original place.
                                                      Luo Guangli

    Mr. Luo Guangli:

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health replies to your comments as follows:

    Thank you for your suggestions regarding our bureau's dredging project for the Jin River and Chang River. Regarding the area downstream of the Guangyuan Sluice in front of Wanshou Temple, the original dredging plan considered the flow rate, and the river bottom was uniformly set at ten meters wide. However, during construction, we discovered that there were stone revetments on both sides, and it was not suitable to pile mud on the river bottom. Therefore, we have changed the plan based on the actual situation and decided to transport all the mud from the river bottom outside the river channel. Because the masses of the Thirteenth District Market Street who were originally responsible for the construction were unwilling to undertake this change, we have mobilized the masses of Wanshou Temple Village in the Sixteenth District to take on the task, which is expected to be completed on April 7th. Furthermore, the river slope collapse is due to encountering quicksand in the geology. We have now decided to adopt pile driving for bank protection. Because our own design time was rushed, and some cadres and the masses still lack sufficient experience in river dredging projects, there must be some inappropriate aspects. We hope that everyone will actively give us suggestions to help us do the project better.
                                                        Editor

### 改进市内疏河工程  京市卫生工程局答罗光理

　　改进市内疏河工程
    京市卫生工程局答罗光理编辑同志：
    近来北京疏浚市内河道，市民莫不说好。但是我又听到万寿寺河边一带老百姓说：“修河是好事，就是修的不好。政府花了这样多的钱，应该修好，如果这样修下去，实在不合算。”这里所反映主要缺点，在于未将河中泥土全部挑到两岭，而只将泥土放於河堤两边。现已有部分地方开始下垮到河底，如果天雨，就会将大部泥土归还原地。
                                                      罗光理罗光理君：
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局对你的意见答复如下：
    谢谢你对我局疏浚金河长河工程的建议，关于万寿寺前广源闸下游一带，原来的疏浚计划是照顾了流速关系，河底一致定为十公尺宽。但在施工时，我们已发现该处两旁有石护岸，河底不宜堆泥，已根据实地情况变更计划、改定将河底泥土全部运至河身以外。因原来施工的十三区市场街群众不愿担任此项变更工程，故另发动十六区万寿寺村群众担任，预计四月七日完成。又河坡塌陷系因地质遇到流沙，现在我们已决定采取打桩护岸办法。因为我们本身设计时间仓促和一部分干部及群众对挖河工程经验尚不充足，不妥当的地方一定有的，希望大家踊跃的给我们提意见帮助我们把工程作得更好。
