Be Heroes in War, Be Models in Production
	North China Troops Spring Ploughing Fully Unfolded
	[Our Newspaper News] The large-scale agricultural and water conservancy production participated in by the various units of the North China People's Liberation Army has fully commenced in early April. The North China troops have determined that this year's production will focus on reclaiming farms and constructing water conservancy projects. Since January, in addition to continuing regular training, the troops have actively started various preparations for production. By early March this year, this preparatory work had been largely completed. According to preliminary statistics, a certain army corps, the various directly subordinate divisions of the military region, and the troops of the three provincial military regions of Chahar, Pingyuan, and Hebei Province, have contracted a total of 3,385,000 workdays with the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau and the water conservancy bureaus of various provinces in North China (the vast majority of the projects are flood prevention and levee restoration, river dredging and drainage projects for the Yongding River, Hai River, Luan River, Jiyun River, North Canal, Ziya River, and Sanggan River, and part of the canal irrigation projects in Chahar, Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan provinces). In terms of agriculture, the number of land distributed by the government or rented from farmers has not yet been fully counted for the entire region's troops, with a certain army corps alone reaching 122,000 mu. This scale of production is very large, so they have prepared cautiously, just as they did when organizing wars in the past. Most troops have extracted many division and regimental leaders, combined with hired technicians and experts, and consulted local farmers to repeatedly survey, map, and test the land, crops, and projects they are about to manage. Commander Yang Chengwu of a certain army corps personally took charge of organizing this work. Division Commander Cheng Shaofu of a certain division led a survey team to a certain coastal area in December last year, braving wind and snow, and stayed there for more than forty days to conduct a precise survey of that land. Based on the survey, the troops formulated production plans, conducted labor force organization and education, and prepared tools, fertilizers, seeds, dormitories, firewood, food, and vegetables. In early and mid-March, many troops held production oath-taking rallies to inspect the preparatory work. In late March, in accordance with the order of the North China Military Region, they moved to the production locations. By early April, all the troops of the North China Military Region, except those responsible for national defense, bandit suppression, and guarding, had arrived at the production locations and started farming.
	Judging from the situation in the past few days, all production is proceeding smoothly. The reclamation work of 40,000 mu of paddy fields in a certain area has fully begun. The soil in this area is too alkaline and must be channeled, seawater introduced, and washed three times to remove the alkalinity before it can be cultivated. Currently, the canal is being dug intensively. A certain division started work for six and a half days and has completed four-fifths of the 12,000-meter-long water diversion main canal plan. A certain farm has sown 5,000 mu of spring wheat on March 21, and by the 29th, it had sown another 890 mu of hemp. The military region's production plan for this year stipulates that one workday should dig less than three cubic meters of earth (the general average efficiency of the masses), but since the start of work, each workday of each troop has averaged more than three cubic meters per day. A certain regiment completed a ten-and-a-half-day task in four days, digging 2,200 cubic meters of earth, with each person working seven and a half hours a day, and the earth-digging record reached 7.5 cubic meters. A certain regiment, which won the first merit in the Taiyuan liberation battle, completed a ten-day project plan in six days, from March 20 to 25, with each person digging an average of 3.78 cubic meters of earth per day. According to the regiment's report, the production enthusiasm of soldiers and cadres has always been high; many soldiers have requested to be recognized for their contributions and join the Party in production. Political Commissar Ni and Chief of Staff Zhao, in addition to grasping the overall production leadership of the regiment, dug and carried earth with the soldiers every day. Kong Xiangyuan, the first-class meritorious hero who first ascended the city during the liberation of Taiyuan, although small and weak, still rushed to carry earth every day, which greatly influenced and motivated everyone. During the six days of production, many labor models emerged in the regiment. Gao Zhong, the deputy platoon leader of the first company, became famous throughout the regiment for carrying 426 loads of earth in one day. The artillery company averaged 4.5 cubic meters of earth per person per day, becoming a model for the whole regiment to learn from. The regiment's production has been praised by local people and local staff. The folks from the Qianjiapu Village production team, who worked with the regiment, said: "These young men are really good. They are very tough in battle and even better than us in production."
	According to the responsible parties of the North China Military Region, they are confident to complete this year's scheduled production plan.

　　打仗当英雄  生产作模范
    华北部队春耕全面展开
    【本报讯】华北人民解放军各部队参加的大规模的农业、水利生产，已在四月初旬，全面地开始了。华北部队确定了今年的生产，以开垦农场、建设水利为主。自一月起，部队除继续正规训练外，积极着手生产的各项准备工作。到今年三月上旬，这种准备工作，已大体完成。据初步统计，某兵团，军区各直属师、察哈尔、平原、河北省三个省军区部队，共向华北水利工程局及华北各省水利局包工三百卅八万五千个（工程绝大部分为永定河、海河、滦河、蓟运河、北运河、子牙河、桑乾河的防洪复堤、挖河排水工程及察、晋、冀、平原等省的一部分开渠灌溉工程）。农业方面，由政府分配或向农民租种的土地数，尚无全区部队的统计，仅某兵团即达十二万二千亩。这种生产规模是很大的，因此，他们像以往组织战争一样，谨慎地进行了准备。各部队大都抽出许多师、团首长，结合聘请的技师、专家、请教当地农民，对自己即将经营的土地、作物、工程，反复勘察、绘图、试工。某兵团杨成武司令员即亲自负责组织这一工作。某师成少甫师长曾带领一个勘察队在去年十二月，冒着风雪，到某海滨区住了四十多天，把那块土地作了精密调查。根据调查，各部队制订了生产计划，进行了劳动力的编成与教育，和工具、肥料、籽种、宿舍、烧柴、食粮、菜蔬的准备。三月上旬中旬，许多部队开了生产誓师大会，检查了准备工作。三月下旬，依据华北军区命令，开向生产地点。至四月初旬，华北军区部队，除担任国防、剿匪、警戒的部队外，均已到达生产地点，全部开始耕作。
    从最近几天情况看，一切生产均在顺利进行中。某地四万亩稻田的开垦工作已全部开始。这块土地碱性太大，须在上面开好渠，引进海水，冲洗三次，把碱质洗净，才能耕种。现正在紧张的挖渠中。某师动工六天半，已完成长达一万二千米引水干渠计划的五分之四。某地农场已于三月二十一日，播种春麦五千亩，到廿九日，又播种麻八百九十亩。军区今年生产计划中，规定了一个工挖土三立方以内（群众一般平均效率），但开工以来，各部队每个工每日均平均在三个立方以上。某团四天完成十天半任务，挖土二千二百立方，每人每日劳动七小时半，挖土纪录竟达到七·五立方。解放太原战斗中，荣获登城首功的某团，在三月二十日至二十五日，六天时间，完成十天的工程计划，每人每日挖土三·七八立方。据该团报告，战士干部生产情绪始终高涨；很多战士要求在生产中立功入党。倪团政治委员，赵参谋长除掌握全团生产领导外，每天都和战士一块挖土担土。解放太原市登城第一名大功功臣孔祥元，虽然身小力弱，但每天还是抢着担土，这都大大影响和带动了大家。该团六天生产中，涌现出许多劳动模范，一连副排长高忠以一天担土四百二十六担而名扬全团。炮兵连每人每日平均挖土四、五立方，成为全团学习的榜样。该团的生产，得到当地群众和地方工作人员的称赞。和该团一块生产的千家铺村生产队的老乡说：“小伙子们真行。打仗挺硬，生产比我们还棒。”
    据华北军区负责方面表示，有信心完成今年的预定生产计划。
