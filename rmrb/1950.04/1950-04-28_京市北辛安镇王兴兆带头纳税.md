　　Beixin'an Town, Beijing
    Wang Xingzhao Takes the Lead in Paying Taxes
    [This newspaper dispatch] In the jurisdiction of the Ninth Sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau, many activists have emerged among the merchants during the current collection of the second half of 1949 industrial and commercial tax. Wang Xingzhao, the manager of Jushengyuan in Beixin'an, has made ideological progress and shown positive performance since liberation. He is now the director of the Industry and Commerce Federation of the 19th District. In this evaluation, the shop was assessed 110 points, equivalent to 2,145,000 yuan. On the morning of the first day (April 1st) he received the payment notice, Wang Xingzhao paid all the tax in one lump sum. He also frequently went to the tax office to see who had not yet paid, and personally persuaded and mobilized them to pay early. From April 1st to 15th, he also automatically convened two tax payment mobilization meetings, saying: "The state's finances are currently difficult, and we should assist our government in overcoming these difficulties. We need to look further ahead, and we must submit to the interests of the state and the people." Under his active leadership and mobilization influence, many of the larger merchants in Beixin'an Town paid their taxes ahead of schedule.
