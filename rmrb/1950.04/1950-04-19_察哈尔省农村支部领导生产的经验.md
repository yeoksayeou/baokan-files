　　The Experience of Rural Branch Leadership in Production in Chahar Province

　　Editor's Note: This article is part of the organizational work report of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in February. The Organization Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee considered this experience to be very good and circulated it to various places for promotion and expansion, and continuously improved it during the promotion process. It is now published for reference in various places.

　　The Core Role of the Branch in Leading Production

　　In 1949, most rural branches in Chahar Province played their due role in leading agricultural production, ensuring the planting of 38 million trees, the selection of 100,000 *shi* of seeds, and the autumn plowing of 85% of the land, thereby basically completing the task of increasing grain production by 8 million *shi*. The branch's leading role in production is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1) Actively publicizing the Party's policies. The implementation of various policies and production tasks is achieved through the active role of branch members in publicity and education, so that the masses can accept them. After solving the ideological problems of the delegates at the local Party congresses, they said: "As long as we understand the policies, our publicity when we return will be more effective than yours." After returning to the village, Party members actively publicized and took the lead in production. The branch secretary of Songjia Village in Xuanhua picks up manure early every morning and compares manure piles with everyone, ensuring that each *mu* will have three carts of manure this year. In Dongshawu, Huai'an, the district called for wasteland reclamation this spring, but no one was willing. After the branch secretary returned from the meeting in the district, he publicized that wasteland reclamation would be free of burdens for three years, and everyone was willing to reclaim it. Local experience proves that production will not be successful without the leadership of the branch and the active leadership of Party members. Once the ideological concerns of Party members are resolved and reflected in action, the concerns of the masses will naturally be resolved. (2) Organizing the masses with Party members as the core. All the work exchange groups that have persisted well and the collective production tasks that have been completed well have prominently demonstrated the organizational role of the Party. Last spring, there was a drought, and the branch led the masses to carry water for planting. Party members in Dongjiafang, Zhuolu, took the lead in planting 50 *mu* of corn, driving the whole village to plant 600 *mu* of corn and 300 *mu* of hemp. During the summer hoeing, Party members took the lead in organizing work exchange and mutual assistance, completing the hoeing plan. During the autumn plowing, Party members took the lead in organizing human-powered plows and ox teams, completing 85% of the autumn plowing. In winter production, Party members were at the core of organizing various sideline productions, such as the Nansha Ridge branch in Yanggao, which organized 291 men, 230 women, and 8 children to participate in 35 kinds of sideline productions. Facts have proved that production cannot be successful without the leadership of the branch and the active leadership of Party members.

　　Methods of Branch Leadership in Production

　　1. Party internal mobilization and discussion (generally a branch meeting is held) to first clarify the thinking of Party members, and then arrange discussions through village cadre meetings, representative meetings, mass meetings, etc., and gradually implement them so that the government is accepted by the masses.

　　2. Organize forces through government and mass organizations to ensure the realization of branch resolutions, and especially to give play to the vanguard role of Communist Youth League members.

　　3. Party members and cadres divide their work, each leading a piece or several households, and the branch conducts inspections according to the division of labor.

　　4. Give play to the expertise of Party members, and organize and lead the masses to carry out various productions with experts in their respective fields.

　　5. Party members make plans on a household basis, and help the masses (especially the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers) to make plans. The village branch leads the masses to make plans for the entire village.

　　6. In accordance with the current urgent needs and specific production conditions of the masses in the village, grasp the main links and lead production. For example, the Nansha Ridge branch in Yanggao seized the three links of transforming opium addicts and loafers, controlling and transforming returning personnel, and helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor to produce, and started the entire village's production.

　　7. Report situations in a timely manner and lead the masses to solve practical difficulties in production. For example, when autumn plowing in Baitasi, Zhuolu, lacked livestock, the branch led the masses to buy eight donkeys, one horse, and one mule together, solving the problem of insufficient animal power.

　　8. Launch production competitions. The branch calls on Party members to take the lead, and advanced elements lead the backward, and conduct competitions between households and individuals. Good ones are promptly commended.

　　Why the Branch Can Play a Leading Role in Production

　　In the first half of last year, about a quarter of the branches could not lead production well. Now, it is generally developing in a good direction. The number of rural branches in the province that play a leading role in production has reached 85%. Why is there such progress? Because: 1. It was emphasized that the Party committee should do Party affairs work, improve the Party's leadership, and oppose replacing the government with the Party. All work is guaranteed through the branch, and the quality of production and leadership of production is used as the standard for evaluating the branch and Party members. 2. A campaign to review the branch's leadership in production and award model branch Party members was launched in depth. A banner of production models was established among the masses, and some dissatisfaction among the branches that had collapsed due to certain deviations in the rectification of the Party was transformed. 3. The branch was made public, which strengthened the leadership of production. Before the public announcement, when the branch held meetings to discuss production, the masses thought it was causing struggle. When Party members spoke, no one believed them. After the branch was made public, the relationship between the Party and the masses was further strengthened, and the Party's prestige was also improved. Party members are subject to criticism and supervision by the masses at any time. The consciousness of backward Party members has been improved. And in leading the masses to produce, they gradually experienced the consistency of personal interests with the interests of the Party and the people. 4. Party representative meetings were generally held to directly implement the Party's policies to the branch; the establishment of democratic life within the Party improved the enthusiasm of Party members.

　　Several Problems That Need to Be Solved in the Future

　　Fifteen percent of rural branches still cannot play a leading role in production. The main reason why these branches cannot lead production well is that the problems existing in the branch itself have not been resolved. Some of them are old district branches that collapsed during the Party rectification and have not yet stood up; some of them have impure branch organizations and work styles, and some Party members are corrupt, coercive, divorced from the masses, and even individual branches are controlled by feudal forces and superstitious sects; some Party members have ideological problems, their understanding of the Party's agricultural production policy is vague, they are afraid of leading production and delaying work, they are afraid of being cadres if they are active, and they are afraid of being promoted to the district if they are model workers. These are the problems that must be solved in this year's Party rectification and work. In order to transform these backward branches and further improve the leading role of all branches in production, it is necessary to: 1. Continue to improve leadership methods, completely change the all-encompassing work style of replacing the government with the Party and not distinguishing between the Party and the government, establish the working system of various departments, emphasize the leadership of the Party committee over the Party group, and improve the working system of the district committee leading the branch. 2. Combine the evaluation and awards with the continued public disclosure of the Party, and conscientiously rectify and improve the Party organizationally and stylistically. At the end of each production task, focus on summarizing and checking the work of this stage, and carry out the work of awarding and consolidating the Party and making the Party public. 3. Strengthen Party education and improve the consciousness of Party members. In education, combine the resolution of Party members' ideological problems, and call on good Party members to play an exemplary role in labor, mutual assistance, production, and prosperity. 4. Through the Party Congress, timely check and overcome bureaucracy in leadership to ensure the complete realization of production tasks.

### 察哈尔省农村支部领导生产的经验

　　察哈尔省农村支部领导生产的经验
    编者按：此文系中共察哈尔省委组织部二月份组织工作报告的一部分。中共中央华北局组织部认为这个经验很好，曾通报各地加以发扬推广，并在推广中不断提高。兹特发表于后，以供各地参考。
    支部在领导生产中的核心作用
    一九四九年察哈尔省大多数农村支部在领导农业生产上起了应有的作用，保证了全省植树三千八百万株，选种十万石，秋耕地达百分之八十五，因而基本上完成了增产粮食八百万石的任务。支部对生产的领导作用主要表现在两方面：（一）积极宣传党的政策。各种政策和生产任务的贯彻，通过支部党员宣传教育的积极作用，使广大群众都能接受。在各地党代会上解决了党员代表的思想问题之后，他们曾表示说：“只要我们懂了政策，回去宣传可比你们顶事。”党员代表回村后都积极宣传，并带头生产。宣化宋家庄支书，每天早起拾粪，和大家比粪堆，保证今年每亩上三车粪。怀安东沙窊，今年春天区里叫开荒滩，谁也不愿意。支书从区里开会回来，宣传开荒三年不出负担，大家才愿意开了。各地经验证明：只要党员积极生产，群众也就敢于生产致富了。党员的思想顾虑解除了，并表现在行动上，群众的顾虑自然也就解除了。（二）以党员为核心把群众组织起来。凡是变工组坚持得好，集体生产任务完成得好的，都突出的表现了党的组织作用。去春天旱，支部领导群众进行担水点种，涿鹿董家房党员先种棒子五十亩，带动全村点种棒子六百亩，大麻子三百亩。夏锄中党员带头组织变工互助，完成了锄地计划。秋耕中党员带头组织人力犁和牛犋合套，完成了百分之八十五的秋耕地。冬季生产中，以党员为核心组织了各种副业生产，如阳高南沙岭支部组织二百九十一个男子、二百三十个妇女、八个儿童参加三十五种副业。事实证明：没有支部领导和党员的积极带头，生产是搞不好的。
　　支部领导生产的方法
    一、党内动员讨论（一般都是召开支部大会），先把党员思想弄通，然后通过村干会议、代表会、群众会等布置讨论，逐步贯彻，使政权为群众所接受。
    二、通过政权、民众团体组织力量，保证支部决议的实现，特别要发挥青年团员的先锋作用。
    三、党员干部分工，每人领导一片或几户，支部根据分工进行检查。
    四、发挥党员特长，以内行营生组织领导群众进行各种生产。
    五、党员按户作计划，并帮助群众（特别是贫苦的烈军工属）作计划，村支部领导群众作全村计划。
    六、依照本村群众当前的迫切需要和具体生产条件，抓住主要环节，领导生产。如阳高南沙岭支部在领导生产中抓住了改造烟民二流子、管制改造还乡人员、帮助无劳力之烈军工属生产这三个环节，搞起了全村生产。
    七、及时反映情况，并领导群众解决生产中的实际困难，如涿鹿白塔寺秋耕时没有牲口，支部领导群众合伙买了八个驴，一个马，一个骡子，解决了畜力不足的困难。
    八、发动生产竞赛，支部号召，党员带头，先进带动落后，进行户与户、人与人的竞赛，好的及时表扬。
　　为什么支部在生产中能发挥领导作用
    去年前半年，约有四分之一的支部不能很好地领导生产。现在一般是向好的方向发展了。全省农村支部在生产中起领导作用者已达百分之八十五。为什么能有这样的进步呢？因为：一、强调了党委要做党务工作，提高党的领导，反对以党代政。一切工作通过支部的保证，以生产和领导生产的好坏作为考核支部、党员的标准。二、深入开展了检阅支部领导生产、评奖模范支部党员的运动。在群众中树立了生产模范的旗帜，且使整党中因发生某些偏向而躺倒的支部的某些不满情绪有了转变。三、支部公开，加强了对生产的领导。未公开前，支部开会讨论生产，群众认为是闹斗争。党员说话，大家不相信。支部公开后，党群关系进一步密切了，党的威信也提高了。党员随时受到群众的批评和监督。落后党员的觉悟提高了。并在领导群众生产中，逐步体验到个人利益和党与人民利益的一致性。四、普遍召开党代表会议，使党的政策直接贯彻到支部；党内民主生活的树立，提高了党员的积极性。
　　今后须要解决的几个问题
    农村支部中尚有百分之十五不能发挥领导生产的作用。这些支部所以不能很好的领导生产，主要是支部本身存在的问题没有解决。其中一部分是老区支部，整党时躺倒，还没有站起来；一部分是支部组织和作风不纯，有些党员贪污，强迫命令，脱离群众，甚至个别支部为封建势力和迷信道门所把持；一部分党员思想有毛病，对党的农业生产政策认识模糊，怕领导生产误工，怕积极了当干部，怕当了模范提拔到区里等。这些是今年整党中和工作中所必须解决的问题。为了转变这部分落后支部和进一步提高所有支部对生产的领导作用，必须：一、继续改进领导方法，彻底转变以党代政、党政不分的一揽子作风，树立各部门的工作制度，强调党委对党组的领导，健全区委领导支部的工作制度。二、结合评奖和继续公开党，认真从组织上、作风上进行整顿和提高党。在每一生产任务告一段落时，以总结检查这一段的工作为中心，进行评奖和巩固党、公开党的工作。三、加强党的教育，提高党员觉悟。在教育中结合解决党员的思想问题，号召好党员要在劳动互助生产致富中起模范作用。四、通过党代会及时检查并克服领导上的官僚主义，保证生产任务的完满实现。
