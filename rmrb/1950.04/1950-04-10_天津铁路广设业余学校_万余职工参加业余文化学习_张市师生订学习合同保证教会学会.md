　　Tianjin Railway Broadly Establishes Amateur Schools
　　Over Ten Thousand Employees Participate in Amateur Cultural Learning
　　Zhangjiakou Teachers and Students Sign Learning Contracts to Guarantee Teaching and Learning
　　[By our newspaper] The amateur cultural learning of employees in various locations of Tianjin Railway has been widely carried out. Seventy-nine amateur schools have now been established, with a total of over ten thousand three hundred employees enrolled. Tianjin Railway has a total of over forty-one thousand employees, of which over seventy-seven percent have a cultural level at or below elementary school. The majority are elderly and middle-aged workers, with the most in the various engineering sections, coal yards, and factories. Employees live relatively scattered, distributed along the Jingjin, Jingsui, Jingshan, Jinggu, and Jinghan, Jinpu northern section railways. The business they are engaged in is diverse, with dozens of types of work, and the work and rest times are inconsistent; some also have to travel with the train, which has increased the difficulty of organizing learning. Since liberation, due to the improvement of employees' lives and the increase of employees' class consciousness, some areas have organized some night schools and literacy classes based on the urgent demand of employees to improve their cultural and technical skills, with about a thousand people participating in learning. However, due to the lack of sufficient attention from the leadership of the administrative, trade union, and CPC branches, and the Youth League branches in various units, the learning lacked a clear direction and formal organizational plan. In addition, crash production, road maintenance, and personnel adjustments affected learning time, causing the enrollment in many night schools to gradually decrease and eventually stop. At the same time, some night schools also took some detours. Initially, because employees urgently demanded to improve their skills, they directly focused on learning technology from the beginning, but most employees had a low level of education, which caused difficulties in technical learning. For example, workers in the Tianjin Engineering Section learning new road maintenance methods could not do arithmetic, and sweated with anxiety during learning. It was not until after the All-Railway Workers' Congress in November of last year that the direction was clarified. The meeting resolved to vigorously run employee amateur schools, combining technical learning and political learning on the basis of improving culture. This resolution was supported by the vast majority of employees. By early February of this year, the work of establishing employee amateur schools throughout the railway system was rapidly launched. Leading cadres in various sections and factories generally value employee learning. Various amateur schools under the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau have established various systems and learning disciplines. The school's attendance, testing, and class divisions are relatively complete; and the relationship between teachers and students is relatively close. Teachers and students sign learning contracts to ensure teaching and learning, so as to increase the learning effect.
　　According to the experience of the past three months, to do a good job in amateur schools, first of all, the party, government, trade union, and youth league must closely cooperate and organize a unified institution to lead the work of amateur schools, appropriately allocate time, and ensure that employees have a certain amount of learning time under the condition of ensuring the completion of production tasks, so that amateur schools can become consolidated.

　　天津铁路广设业余学校
    万余职工参加业余文化学习 
    张市师生订学习合同保证教会学会
    【本报讯】天津铁路各地职工的业余文化学习已广泛开展，现已成立业余学校七十九处，入学职工共一万零三百余人。天津铁路共有职工四万一千余人，文化程度在高小以下者占百分之七十七强。其中大半是老年与中年工人，以各工务段、煤台、工厂中最多。职工居住比较分散，分布在京津、京绥、京山、京古及京汉、津浦北段各铁路沿线；所从事的业务有数十种之多，作息时间不一；有的还要随车出勤，为组织学习增加了困难。解放以来，由于职工生活得到保障，职工的阶级觉悟提高，有些地区基于职工对提高文化技术的迫切要求而组织了一些夜校与识字班，约有千余人参加学习。但由于各单位的行政、工会与中共支部、青年团支部的领导方面未予以足够的重视，学习缺乏明确的方针与正规的组织计划，加上突击生产、养路与人事调整等工作，影响了学习时间，使许多夜校入学人数逐渐减少而至停顿。同时，有的夜校也走过一些弯路。最初，因为职工迫切要求提高技术，一开始就直接以学习技术为主，但大部分职工文化程度低，在技术学习中发生了困难，如天津工务段的工人学新养路法，不会算术，学习中急得流汗。直至去年十一月的全路工代大会以后，才明确了方针，会上决议大力举办职工业余学校，在提高文化为主的基础上结合技术学习和政治学习。此一决议获得广大职工的拥护。至今年二月初，全路建立职工业余学校的工作便迅速开展起来。各段、厂的领导干部，一般已重视职工学习。张家口铁路分局所属的各业余学校，均订立了各种制度和学习纪律，学校的考勤、测验、分班等都作得比较完备；而且教员与学生之间关系比较密切，由师生订立学习合同，保证教会学会，以增加学习效果。
    根据三个月来的经验，要搞好业余学校，首先必须党、政、工、团的领导密切配合，组织统一的机构来领导业余学校的工作，适当地分配时间，在保证完成生产任务的条件下保障职工一定的学习时间，才能使业余学校趋于巩固。
