Strengthening the Management of Public Grain
The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issues instructions to financial and economic leading organs and grain management departments at all levels regarding strengthening the management of public grain. The full text is as follows:

The public grain collected after last autumn's harvest has mostly been placed in public grain warehouses. This is the result of the efforts of local people's governments at all levels in collecting grain according to the policies stipulated by the Central Government and the enthusiastic payment of grain by the broad masses of people who love their motherland. However, due to certain shortcomings in the management of public grain, according to incomplete reports from various places over the past two to three months, the losses of public grain in storage, including fire, spoilage, robbery, theft, and embezzlement, have been enormous. At a time when the national finances are difficult and some areas have not yet overcome disasters, such a large loss of national public grain is an inexcusable matter. Examining the reasons for the loss of public grain, objectively, it is due to the fact that public safety in some areas has not yet been consolidated, enemy agents and bandits are lurking and sabotaging, grain depots have not been established, and grain is mostly stored in a decentralized manner, making it difficult to manage, and the quality of the grain is impure, with high moisture content and many impurities, making it prone to mildew and insect infestation. However, it must be pointed out that the most important reason is that our financial and economic leading organs and financial and grain management departments at all levels have not paid enough attention to the management of public grain. Many financial and grain departments still have serious bureaucracy, resulting in repeated losses of public grain. If this phenomenon is not quickly and timely corrected, even greater losses may occur in the future. For this reason, the following instructions are given:

1.  It is required that local financial and economic leading organs, financial and grain management departments at all levels, enhance their sense of political responsibility, raise their political vigilance, pay attention to protecting public grain, and strictly prevent enemy agents and bandits from sabotage, robbery, arson, and organized and planned theft. Oppose ideological paralysis and the bureaucratic attitude of being irresponsible towards public grain work. All larger public grain depots must organize armed guards. In areas where enemy agents and bandits are rampant and public security is not yet stable, local military organs and public security departments should be consulted to send armed forces to be stationed around the warehouses to implement armed protection of warehouses and grain. Local grain departments should try to establish close ties with local armed public security departments, and in conjunction with local governments, people's organizations, and peasant activists, carry out mass anti-espionage, anti-special forces, and grain protection work. All public grain warehouses must always pay attention to fire prevention. Larger warehouses should be equipped with fire prevention equipment, and it is strictly forbidden to start fires, cook, smoke, or place flammable materials inside and outside the warehouse. If public grain suffers undue losses due to negligence in prevention, the person in charge of the warehouse shall be subject to legal sanctions.

2.  It must be estimated that there is a lot of public grain this year, most of the warehouse equipment is very poor, and the warmer the weather, the easier it is to mold. Guaranteeing that this year's grain will not be moldy is a major and intensive task for local people's governments at the provincial, county, and district levels. If there is not enough understanding of this, and if sufficient manpower is not prepared for sieving, winnowing, drying, and turning the grain over in warehouses when necessary, it will be difficult to get through the dangerous season of grain spoilage. Therefore, it is required that local financial and economic leading organs, financial and grain management departments at all levels, immediately lead a general inspection of grain depots and grain storage. In the inspection of grain depots, attention should be paid to the temperature, humidity, ventilation, and the height of the foundation of the warehouse. If the warehouse is not suitable for storing grain, it should be immediately remedied or transferred to another warehouse. If it is found that the warehouse needs to be repaired and supplemented, it must be quickly repaired and supplemented. In the inspection of grain storage, attention should be paid to the temperature and the degree of dryness and cleanliness of the grain. If it is found that the grain has high moisture content, many impurities, or signs of rot and insect infestation, measures such as winnowing and turning the grain over in the warehouse should be taken immediately. If the quality of the grain is uneven, it must be stored separately, not mixed together. Once grain that has already been or is being molded and infested with insects is discovered, it should be reported to the higher authorities immediately and measures should be taken for emergency treatment. From now on, grain depots in various places must establish a system of inspecting the warehouse once a month and inspecting the grain once a week. After each inspection, there must be records and reports. Oppose perfunctory work and dereliction of duty. In terms of public grain storage technology, various places should promote and adopt scientific storage methods as much as possible, such as testing the moisture content of grain and measuring the temperature of warehouses and grain. In places where technical equipment conditions are not available, local grain storage experience should also be combined, summarized and improved, and new storage methods should be created. Therefore, various regions should frequently exchange storage experience and improve storage technology.

3.  It is required that local financial and economic leading organs, financial and grain management departments at all levels, strengthen leadership and establish and improve public grain management institutions. In areas where public grain management institutions have not been established, they should be established quickly. Those that have already been established must continue to strengthen and enrich the institutions. All regions must allocate a portion of the approved grain affairs expenses to build some new grain depots, and gradually complete the construction of new grain depots in a planned manner within three or four years. However, in order to meet the urgent needs of current work, it is required that local people's governments be responsible for assisting in solving the warehouse housing problem of grain management departments. All temples, ancestral halls, etc. that are suitable for storing grain must be given to grain depots for use or borrowed as soon as possible. All grain management departments must be equipped with a considerable number of reliable cadres and use retained personnel prudently. Strictly follow the procedures for the disbursement of public grain, and oppose embezzlement, waste, or private theft and misappropriation of public grain. All violators will be subject to legal sanctions. Establish a regular work system. In addition to implementing the monthly inspection of warehouses and weekly inspection of grain as stipulated in the previous paragraph, and summarizing the inspection results level by level and reporting them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and this Committee, a monthly and quarterly reporting system on the storage of public grain in warehouses should also be established to ensure that work is effectively improved in a timely manner, and that the central financial departments understand the storage of public grain throughout the country.

　　加强公粮保管工作
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会指示各级财经领导机关及粮食管理部门
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于加强公粮保管工作给各级地方财经领导机关及财政粮食管理部门的指示，全文如下：
    去年秋收后所征公粮，大部分均已归入公粮库。这是各级地方人民政府按照中央所规定的政策努力征收和全国广大人民爱护祖国踊跃缴纳的结果。但由于公粮保管工作尚有若干缺点，两三个月以来，根据各地不完全的报告，公粮在保管中的损失，包括失火、霉烂、抢劫、偷盗、贪污，为数甚巨。当此国家财政困难，部分地区灾荒尚未渡过的关头，使国家公粮遭受这样大的损失，实是一种不容宽恕的事情。检查公粮所以损失原因，客观上是由于某些地区治安尚未巩固，敌特盗匪潜伏破坏，粮库没有建立，粮食尚多分散储藏，不易保管，以及粮食质量不纯、水分大、杂质多，容易霉腐生虫等等所致。但必须指出：最主要的原因还是由于我们各级财经领导机关及财政和粮食管理部门对公粮保管工作没有足够的重视，不少财粮部门还存在着严重的官僚主义，以致公粮损失，一次再次连续地发生，这种现象如不迅速地及时地设法纠正，以后将可能发生更大的损失。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、要求各级地方财经领导机关、财政及粮食管理部门，提高政治责任心，提高政治警惕性，注意保护公粮，严防敌特匪徒破坏、抢劫、纵火、以及有组织有计划的偷盗。反对思想麻痹和对公粮工作不负责任的官僚态度。一切较大的公粮库，均须组织武装警卫。在敌特匪徒猖獗、治安尚未稳定的地区，应商请当地军事机关和公安部门，派遣武装驻扎仓库周围，实行武装护仓、护粮。各地粮食部门要与地方武装公安部门尽可能地取得密切连系，并结合当地政府、人民团体和农民积极分子开展群众性的防奸、反特、护粮工作。一切公粮仓库，必须经常注意防火，较大仓库，并应按置防火的设备，严禁在库房内外生火、做饭、吸烟，或放置易燃物品。如因防备不慎，而使公粮遭受不应有之损失者，仓库负责人应受法律处分。
    二、必须估计到今年公粮很多，大多数的仓库设备很差，天气愈暖，愈易霉烂。保证今年粮食不受霉烂，是省、县、区各级地方人民政府一项重大的紧张的工作。如果对此没有足够的认识，如果不准备充分的人力，在必要时过筛、扬风、晾晒、翻仓，则决难渡过粮食霉烂的危险季节。因此，要求各级地方财经领导机关、财政及粮食管理部门，立即领导进行一次普遍的检查粮库和存粮的工作。在检查粮库中，要注意库房的温度、湿度、通风及地基高低，凡库房不适宜存粮者，应立即设法补救或施行倒仓，发现库房须加修整补充者，须迅速设法修整补充。在检查存粮中，要注意粮食的温度和干燥、洁净的程度。凡发现粮食水分大，杂质多，或有腐烂生虫象征者，须立即分别进行扬风、翻仓等措施。粮食质量好坏不齐者，则须分开保管，不要混合存放。已经发生或正在霉腐生虫的粮食，一经发现，应即报告上级，并设法进行紧急处理。今后各地粮库须建立每月检查一次仓库与每周检查一次粮食的制度，每次检查之后，须有记录和报告，反对敷衍塞责。在公粮保管技术上，各地应提倡并尽可能地采用科学保管方法，如化验粮食水分，测验库房与粮食温度等。在技术设备条件不具备的地方，亦应结合当地保管粮食经验，加以总结和提高，创造新的保管方法，因此各地区应经常交流保管经验，提高保管技术。
    三、要求各级地方财经领导机关、财政及粮食管理部门，加强领导，建立与健全公粮管理机构。凡未建立公粮管理机构的地区，应迅速建立起来，已经建立者，须继续加强与充实机构。各地区必须在批准的粮务费内，拨出一部费用，修建一些新粮库，有计划地在三、四年内逐渐完成新粮库的修建。但为适应目前工作急需，要求各级地方人民政府负责协助解决粮食管理部门的仓库房屋问题，凡适合存粮的庙宇、祠堂等均须尽先划给粮库使用或借用。一切粮食管理部门要配备相当数量的可靠干部，审慎使用留用人员。严格公粮支拨手续，反对贪污浪费或私自盗卖挪用公粮，凡违犯者，一律给以法律处分。建立正规的工作制度，除依前项规定实行每月检查仓库，每周检查粮食，将检查结果逐级汇总层报中央人民政府财政部及本委外，并应建立按月按季的仓库公粮保管情况的报告制度，保证切实做到，以便及时改进工作，并使中央财经部门了解全国公粮保管情况。
