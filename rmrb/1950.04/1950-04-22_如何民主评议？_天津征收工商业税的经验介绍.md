How to Conduct Democratic Appraisal?
    —Introducing Tianjin's Experience in Collecting Industrial and Commercial Taxes
    By Our Special Correspondent Gu Weijin
    The method of collecting industrial and commercial taxes through democratic appraisal is a transitional approach that Tianjin has adopted for over a year.
    Tianjin has approximately 40,000 industrial and commercial businesses, and its liberation was relatively recent. The foundation of its financial and economic work is not as strong as that of the Northeast. In this type of region, neither auditing nor self-reporting methods are sufficiently mature for collecting industrial and commercial taxes. If auditing is used, business owners, having developed a habit of falsifying accounts to cope with unreasonable taxation during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, would make fair burden allocation difficult. If self-reporting and payment are used, many business owners, limited by their level of awareness, would find it difficult to report truthfully, leading to unfair burden allocation and severe tax evasion. In light of this situation, the Tianjin Municipal Government has temporarily adopted the method of democratic appraisal for tax collection. The basic principle of democratic appraisal is to entrust the industrial and commercial sectors to find ways to fulfill their own tax burdens; under mutual understanding and supervision, taxes are reasonably allocated based on the total burden assigned by the government. In terms of work methods, the goal is to mobilize and organize industrial and commercial business owners through appraisal, and under the government's leadership, complete the collection task.
    (1) Establish Appraisal Organizations, Lead Discussions Among Businesses
    After Tianjin's liberation, a democratic appraisal approach was adopted when supplementing the collection of industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1948 and the first half of 1949, and appraisal organizations were established. The government gathered relevant departments, such as the Municipal Government, Financial and Economic Committee, Tax Bureau, Finance Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, Foreign Trade Administration Bureau, Foreign Affairs Office, People's Bank, and Public Security Bureau, to form a Municipal Promotion Committee to control all collection work: (1) To ensure ideological consistency through the government's confirmed tax collection targets (i.e., the total burden score, which is determined based on investigations of business operations) and the Tax Bureau's proposed collection plan. (2) To organize industrial and commercial businesses by sector and accurately determine the number of businesses. (3) To carry out necessary rectification of the original trade associations. (4) To promote trade associations to organize the masses. First, to conduct thorough publicity and mobilization among the masses to make them understand the tax policy and the important significance of democratic appraisal; then, trade associations organized members to establish industry appraisal committees (with appraisal groups established if there were many businesses in the industry), joint industry appraisal committees, and democratically elect leaders (committee members, group leaders) at all levels of the appraisal organization.
    After the establishment of the appraisal organizations at all levels, they led the businesses to conduct appraisals according to the burden score assigned by the government. First, similar industries were organized into groups for preliminary appraisal, followed by joint appraisal by various industries and then industry appraisal. Finally, the score was allocated to individual businesses. During the various appraisals, a meticulous and serious attitude was generally maintained. First, everyone self-reported the basis for the appraisal (i.e., turnover, profit margin, etc.), followed by discussion, research, investigation, and comparison of typical businesses. During the discussion, if the business being appraised had any dissenting opinions, they could be fully raised, and everyone would conduct further investigation and research based on their opinions. This process of repeated discussion, research, investigation, and comparison finally determined the burden of the business being appraised.
    (2) Mobilize and Rely on the Masses to Allocate Tax Shares
    The general experience of democratic appraisal is to rely on the masses and follow the mass line. Specifically, this is reflected in three aspects:
    First, go deep into the masses and investigate typical businesses. That is, investigate the operating conditions between different industries, as well as the operating conditions of large, medium, and small businesses within the same industry. By investigating typical businesses, understand the operating conditions of general businesses. Only in this way can there be a basis for determining the total burden score of businesses, probing whether the burden between industries is balanced, whether the burden between businesses is reasonable, and handling disputes that arise during the appraisal process (such as large businesses taking advantage of small businesses, small businesses squeezing large businesses, etc.). Doing a good job of investigation is not something that can be done by rushing during the collection process; it requires regularly dispatching dedicated personnel to conduct investigations and accumulate materials, as well as utilizing active elements to assist in this work.
    Second, the burden is a matter for the masses, and the burden score must be determined through the masses. At that time, people's representative conferences at all levels had not been organized, so the burden score had to be determined through the Municipal Promotion Committee. This time, the collection of industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1949 was determined through the People's Representative Conference.
    Third, it is necessary to rely on the masses to solve many difficulties: (1) Solve the difficulty of organizing the masses. The city has about 40,000 industrial and commercial businesses, and it is difficult to organize them relying solely on cadres. The tax bureau promoted the original trade associations, which quickly organized the masses and launched the work. (2) Solve the difficulties during the appraisal. Due to limitations in the work foundation, the tax bureau did not know much about the business operations of the businesses, making it difficult to determine the basis for appraisal, and also lacked appraisal methods. After mobilizing the masses for discussion and research, the masses used their wisdom to create many appraisal bases (such as the import and export industry, calculating the burden based on the different profit margins of import, export, exchange, and commission-earning turnover; the warehouse industry appraising based on the turnover of agency and self-operated parts), and created many appraisal methods (such as self-reporting and public discussion, grading, etc.), enabling the appraisal work to develop rapidly and laying a foundation for the appraisal work. (3) Solve the government's difficulty in dealing with tax evaders. During the appraisal, some backward businesses often tried to deceive the government in an attempt to evade taxes. Due to the government's limited understanding of the situation, it was difficult to identify them for a while. After the masses intervened, the truth was quickly revealed and the problem was solved. For example, when collecting industrial and commercial taxes for the first half of 1949, Fu Laihang, a grocery store, was assessed a tax of 200,000 yuan. The female manager of the store deliberately wore ragged clothes and complained to the tax bureau that she had not been in business for six months, requesting tax exemption. The tax bureau discussed the matter with the trade association, which understood the inside story of Fu Laihang and pointed out that although Fu Laihang verbally claimed not to be in business, it actually used two telephone lines and engaged in many speculative businesses with its peers, and had illegal transactions involving gold and silver coins. It also presented the accounts of its dealings with its peers as evidence. Fu Laihang had no choice but to admit its mistake and pay the tax.
    To do a good job of relying on the masses for tax collection, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. This requires: (1) Before the appraisal, carrying out extensive and in-depth publicity and education on tax policies among the masses; first educating the appraisal committee members and group leaders, and then educating the businesses through them. In the publicity and education, it is necessary to combine actual examples and promptly address the concerns of the masses. Only in this way can tax policies be implemented among the masses and the awareness of the masses gradually raised. (2) Appraisal organizations at all levels must be generated from the bottom up, and appraisal committee members and group leaders must be democratically elected. By implementing this spirit of democratization, the masses will treat the appraisal work as their own business and handle it seriously and responsibly. (3) After each stage of the work is completed, it is necessary to convene a conference of appraisal committee members and group leaders from various industries to summarize experiences, commend merchants who have been active in their work, and criticize bad elements who have performed poorly, so as to improve the awareness and work enthusiasm of merchants.
    In addition, to do a good job of democratic appraisal, attention must also be paid to several issues:
    First, pay attention to mastering joint appraisal (i.e., joint appraisal by various industries, hereinafter the same). The burden score is allocated to each industry and each business after joint appraisal. Whether the joint appraisal is fair affects the fairness of each industry and each business. At the same time, some businesses have parochialism during joint appraisal (i.e., they hope that the score of their own industry will be appraised lower). Therefore, they often argue fiercely during joint appraisal. The tax bureau must promptly educate businesses to correct the idea of parochialism; at the same time, it must mobilize everyone to investigate and research, and master materials, as a basis for handling disputes. For example, when collecting industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1948, the standing committee members of the electrical material industry and the coal industry both believed that the grade appraised for their own industry was too high and requested reconsideration. After everyone conducted an in-depth investigation and understanding of the two industries, it was found that the profit margins of the two industries were higher than the grade appraised. In this way, the standing committee members of the two industries had nothing to say.
    Second, tax work cannot be done solely by the tax bureau; relevant departments must attach importance to it and cooperate closely (such as newspapers and radio stations assisting in publicity) in order to do a good job. At the same time, the city has a high concentration, and the leadership must be centralized and unified in order to exert work efficiency.
    Third, strengthen cadre education and improve the policy level of cadres, so that cadres can handle affairs in accordance with policies in the collection work.
    (3) Create Various Conditions to Implement Tax Calculation According to Rates
    Adopting the method of democratic appraisal for collecting industrial and commercial taxes is a transitional method during a period of unsound accounting systems. In the future, it must progress towards "self-reporting and actual payment, combined with auditing, and tax calculation according to rates based on turnover and income" in order to truly achieve fairness and reasonableness in the burden. We must now create various conditions for this. This means strengthening typical investigations, mastering materials, educating merchants, organizing merchants, and improving merchant awareness, so that accounts are truthful. When these conditions are mature, we can no longer use the democratic appraisal method of tax collection.

　　如何民主评议？
    ——天津征收工商业税的经验介绍
    本报特派记者  古维进
    用民主评议征收工商业税的方法是天津市一年多来所采用的过渡时期的办法。
    天津约有工商业四万户，解放时间不长，财经工作基础尚不如东北。在此种类型地区征收工商业税，用查账与自报办法，条件均不成熟。如果采用查账征收办法，商人在国民党反动统治时期，为应付不合理的征税，曾经普遍养成造假账的习惯，因此查账征收，很难使负担公允。如果采用自报实缴，则很多商人为觉悟程度所限，自报难以真实，也就会使负担不尽公允，而且易于造成严重的漏税。天津市政府根据这种情况，乃暂时采用民主评议的征收方法。民主评议的基本精神，就是把工商业的负担交给工商业者自己来设法完成；在彼此了解情况及互相督促推动之下，根据政府分配的负担额，合理分配。在工作方法上，就是经过评议把工商业者发动与组织起来，在政府领导之下，完成征收任务。
    （一）成立评议组织  领导商户讨论
    天津解放以后，曾在补征一九四八年下半年及一九四九年上半年的工商业税时，采取了民主评议的方式，成立了评议的组织。由政府集合有关部门，如市政府、财经委员会、税务局、财政局、工商局、对外贸易管理局、外事处、人民银行、公安局等单位，组成市推动委员会，掌握全部征收工作：（一）通过政府确定的征收任务（即负担总分数。这是根据调查商户营业情况而确定的）和税务局拟定的征收方案，使领导思想一致。（二）整理工商业户的业别，确实掌握户数。（三）对原日的行业公会，加以必要的整顿。（四）推动行业公会组织群众。首先向群众深入宣传动员，使群众明了税收政策及民主评议的重要意义；接着各行业公会组织会员，建立行业评议委员会（如行业户数多的，下设评议小组）、行业联合评议委员会，及民主选举各级评议组织负责人（委员、小组长）。
    各级评议组织建立起来后，根据政府分配的负担分数，领导商户评议。首先由近似行业编成小组初步评议，接着由各行业联合评议，及行业评议，最后把分数分配到户。在各种评议当中，一般尚能以缜密认真的态度进行。首先，由大家自报评议的根据（即营业额、利润率等），大家进行讨论、研究、调查，并找出典型户互相比较。在讨论中，被评议的商户如有不同意的意见，可以尽量提出，大家根据他的意见，再进行调查研究。这样经过反复讨论、研究、调查、比较，最后才确定被评议的商户的负担。
    （二）发动群众依靠群众分配税分
    民主评议总的经验是：依靠群众，走群众路线。具体说来，表现在三个方面：
    第一，深入群众，调查典型户。即调查不同的行业之间的营业情况，及调查同一行业之间的大、中、小三种行业的营业情况。通过典型户的调查，了解一般商户的营业情况。这样，才能有根据确定商户总的负担分数，才能有根据测探行业与行业间的负担是否平衡、户与户间的负担是否合理，才能有根据处理评议过程中所发生的纠纷（如大户吃小户，小户挤大户等）。作好调查工作，不是只依靠征收过程中突击一下可以办好的，必须平时有计划有步骤的派出专人从事调查和积累材料，及运用积极分子协助这个工作。
    第二，负担是群众的事情，负担分数多少必须通过群众。当时各界人民代表会议未曾组织起来，负担分数只好通过市推动委员会。这次征收一九四九年下半年工商业税，就是通过各界人民代表会议确定负担分数的。
    第三，必须依靠群众，才可以解决许多困难：（一）解决组织群众的困难。全市约有四万工商业户，只依靠干部去组织是困难的，税局方面推动了原日的同业公会，却很快地把群众组织起来，开展了工作。（二）解决评议当中的困难。由于工作基础限制，税局方面对于商户的营业情况了解不多，很难确定评议的根据，同时对于评议的办法也是缺乏的。经过发动群众讨论研究，群众发挥智慧，创造了许多评议的根据（如进出口业，根据进口、出口、换货、赚佣金的营业额的利润大小不同，去算换负担，货栈业根据代理部分与自营部分的营业额评议），及创造许多评议的办法（如自报公议、分等分级等），使评议工作迅速开展，并给评议工作打下基础。（三）解决政府处理逃税户的困难。在评议中，一些落后商户，常设法蒙蔽政府，企图逃税。政府为了解情况所限，一时很难识别。经过群众，就很快把真象弄明、把问题解决了。如征收一九四九年上半年工商业税时，杂货业福来行经评定应纳税额二十万元，该行女经理故穿破衣，向税务局哭诉半年没有营业，要求免税。税务局把此事和同业公会商量研究，同业公会了解福来行的内情，指出福来行虽然口头上说没有营业，实际上却用了两部电话机和同业作了许多倒把的生意，且有非法买卖金子、银元等情，同时拿出同业与他往来的账对证。福来行只好认错纳税。
    要作好依靠群众征税的工作，必须作到充分发动群众。这就要：（一）在评议之前，把税收政策在群众中展开广泛深入的宣传教育；首先教育评议委员及小组长，然后通过他们教育商户。在宣传教育中，一面须结合实际事例进行，一面须发现群众的顾虑，及时解决。这样，才能把税收政策贯彻到群众中去，逐渐提高群众的觉悟。（二）各级评议组织必须自下而上产生，评议委员和小组长必须民主选举。贯彻这种民主化的精神，群众才会把评议工作当成自己的事情，认真负责处理。（三）工作每告一段落后，要召集各行业的评议委员和小组长大会，总结经验，表扬工作积极的商人，批评表现不好的坏分子，提高商户的觉悟性与工作积极性。
    另外，要作好民主评议，还须注意几个问题：
    第一、注意掌握联评（即各个行业联合评议，下同）。负担分数是经过联评后分配给各业各户，联评公允与否，影响各业各户的公允。同时，有些商户在联评时存在本位主义（即希望本行业的分数评得少些），因之在联评时常争执得很厉害。税局方面一面要及时教育商户纠正本位主义的思想；一面又要发动大家调查研究，掌握材料，作为处理纠纷的依据，如征收一九四八年下半年工商业税时，电料业与煤业的常委，都认为本行业评的等级过高，要求复议。大家对该两行业深入调查了解后，发现该两行业的利润率都比评的等级还高。这样，该两行业的常委才没有话说。
    第二、税收工作不是只依靠税务局可以办好的，必须有关部门都重视起来，密切配合（如报社、电台协助宣传等），才能把工作搞好。同时城市集中性大，领导方面必须集中统一，才能发挥工作效能。
    第三、加强干部教育，提高干部的政策水平，干部才能在征收工作中，按着政策办事。
    （三）创造各种条件  实行依率计征
    征收工商业税采取民主评议方法，乃是会计制度不健全时期的一种过渡办法，今后必须朝着“自报实缴，配合查账，按其营业额及所得额，依率计征”方向进展，才能使负担真正作到公平合理。我们现在必须为此创造各种条件。这就是要加强典型调查，掌握材料，及教育商人，组织商人，并提高商人觉悟，作到账簿真实。这种条件成熟的时候，就可以不再用民主评议这个征收方法了。
