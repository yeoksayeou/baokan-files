　　Beijing Electric Power Bureau Implements Quota Management

    Meter Reading and Accounting Set New Records

    Driving Other Departments to Improve Work Efficiency

    [Our Newspaper] (Reporter Lin Mo): Since February, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau has mobilized its employees to discuss and formulate production plans and implement a quota management system. It has achieved significant results in improving work efficiency, utilizing waste materials for conservation, and organizing power lines to reduce power loss, which has created favorable conditions for the implementation of the quota management system. Before liberation, the electricity bill accounting section of the accounting department always had each person accounting for 135 households in eight hours per day. In February, Wu Shufang, a Communist Party member, took the lead in setting and completing a plan to account for 180 households per day. This sparked a spirit of competition among everyone, and everyone's records rose rapidly and universally. By the end of February, one-third of the people had reached more than 200 households accounted for per day, with some individuals breaking through 300 households, and the overall average had increased to 165 households. By late March, it had further increased to 195 households. The meter reading section also increased from 165 households in the past to more than 280 households, with individuals such as Tang Zhikui and Yang Yuhai reaching around 500 households. In total, the meter reading and accounting sections of the department reduced labor by 376 workers in February compared to January, increasing efficiency by 38 percent. In the past, the meter reading section had nine people per shift, and they could not rest on Sundays. Now, there are seven people per shift, and each person can rest one day per week.

    抄表核算创新纪录
    带动其他部门提高工作效率
    【本报讯】记者林沫报道：北京市电业管理局自二月份发动职工讨论制订生产计划试行定额管理制度以来，对提高工作效率、利用废料进行节约、整理线路以减少电力损失等方面，已获得显著成绩；并给定额管理制度的推行创造了有利条件。该局核算股核算电费部分，解放后一直是每人每天八小时核算一百三十五户。二月份，党员吴淑芳首先订出并完成了每天核算一百八十户的计划。由此引起大家的竞赛情绪，每人的纪录都普遍迅速上涨。至二月底止，有三分之一的人达到每日核算二百户以上，个别的并突破三百户，全部平均已提高到一百六十五户。至三月下旬已进一步提高到一百九十五户。抄表部分亦由过去的一百六十五户提高到二百八十户以上，个别的像唐志奎、杨玉海曾达到五百户上下。总计该股抄表、核算两部分二月份较一月份减少用工三百七十六个，效率提高百分之三十八。过去抄表部分每班九个人，星期日不能休息，现在每班七个人，每人每周可休息一日。
