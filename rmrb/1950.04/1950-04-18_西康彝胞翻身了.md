　　The Yi People of Xikang Have Been Emancipated
    Guo Zhen
    After the liberation of the Xichang area, the Yi compatriots scattered throughout the vast mountainous regions of Xikang were emancipated. The Yi people warmly consoled the People's Liberation Army and voluntarily assisted the troops in collecting weapons hidden and discarded by the fleeing bandits and in searching out scattered bandits.
    As the People's Liberation Army marched towards Xichang, many Yi compatriots voluntarily led the way for the troops, and many ran back to the mountains and forests to tell their relatives that the People's Liberation Army had arrived. On March 29th, five Yi compatriots from the fifth bao of the Baisha District in the north of Xichang city brought chickens and sheep into the city to慰问 (convey sympathy and solicitude to) the People's Liberation Army. In simple Chinese, they said, "The Liberation Army is as kind as the Red Army was back then." They excitedly went to the pseudo-provincial government, the pseudo-garrison headquarters, and other public places, places they previously didn't dare even glance at, and toured and played around. The People's Liberation Army treated them with wine, which the Yi people particularly liked, and took pictures of them as souvenirs. The Yi people happily pointed to the "August 1st" insignia on the soldiers' hats and said, "We want to wear this too (meaning they wanted to join the Liberation Army)!"
    After the Yi representatives returned, the Yi people of Beishan reported the secret hideout of Hu bandits containing eight 60mm mortars, four heavy machine guns, and five carbine rifles; and they sent over fifty-four bandit soldiers left behind by the Hu bandit Zong Nan, who had ordered to "persist in guerrilla warfare." On March 31st, in the Xincun and Jiucun areas, fifty miles north of Xichang, the Yi compatriots assisted the People's Liberation Army in defeating more than 400 bandits from the First Division, capturing alive the division commander Zhu Guangzu and 234 others. They excitedly danced their ethnic dances and sent the bandits they captured to the city and handed them over to the People's Liberation Army.
    The Yi people can now freely walk around Xichang city, and they will never be shouted at or whipped by bandits again. When they bring firewood and potatoes into the city to sell again, they will never be extorted for entry taxes by bandits again.

　　西康彝胞翻身了
    郭振
    西昌地区解放后，散居在西康广大山区的彝族同胞翻了身。彝胞们热情地慰劳人民解放军，并自动协助部队收集溃匪隐匿抛置的武器和搜剿散匪。
    人民解放军向西昌进军途中，很多彝胞自动为部队带路，很多人跑回山林去告诉自己的亲人说人民解放军来到了。三月二十九日，西昌城北白沙区第五保五位彝胞带着鸡、羊进城来慰问解放军，他们用简单的汉语说：“解放军和当年红军一样的和气。”他们兴奋地到了伪省政府、伪警备司令部和其他公共场所，这些以前他们望都不敢多望一下的地方，来回地参观、游玩。人民解放军用彝胞所特别喜欢的酒招待他们，并一一照像留念。彝胞们快乐地指着战士们帽上的“八一”军徽说：“我们也要这个戴（想参加解放军的意思）！”
    彝胞代表回去后，当天就有北山彝胞报告胡匪暗藏的八门六零炮、四挺重机枪、五支卡宾枪；并送来胡匪宗南留下“坚持游击”的五十四个匪军。三月三十一日，彝胞在西昌北五十里的新村、旧村地区，协助人民解放军击溃了匪军第一师四百余人，活捉师长朱光祖以下二百三十四名。他们兴奋地跳着自己民族的舞蹈，把他们捉到的匪军送到城里交给人民解放军。
    彝胞现在可以在西昌城里自由地走来走去，他们永远不会再受到匪军的吆喝、鞭打了。当他们再运柴火和洋芋进城来卖的时候，也永远不会再有匪军向他们勒索入城税了。
