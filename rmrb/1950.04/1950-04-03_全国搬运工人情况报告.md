　　Report on the Situation of 搬运 (transport/porter) Workers Nationwide
　　China 搬运 Workers Union National Committee
　　According to statistics from fifty cities nationwide (excluding the Southwest region), there are a total of 568,584 搬运 workers, including those involved in docks, vehicle transportation, loading and unloading, and rickshaws (187,370 people). Individual cities also include workers in the water industry, waste disposal, camel pulling, stone cutting, and boatmen.

　　Currently, 搬运 workers unions and preparatory committees have been widely established in various cities, counties, and towns. According to statistics from January of this year, the aforementioned fifty cities have a total of 313,768 members, accounting for 55% of the total number of workers. There are 711 established trade unions, 487 branch organizations, 625 sub-branch organizations, and 11,018 member groups.

　　　　I. Feudal Exploitation System Before Liberation

　　(1) Ruling Partition

　　搬运 workers in various cities suffered from the dark rule and enslavement of 码头 (wharf/dock) bosses, gang leaders, labor contractors, and 脚行 (porterage firm) bosses. These feudal leaders controlled externally and oppressed internally. They had money, power, thugs, and litigators. They had lawyers for lawsuits and gangsters for fights. They occupied certain areas and monopolized 搬运 operations. Examples include the 码头 in Wuhan (southern 码头 include both water and land types), the 把 in Nanchang, the 大柜 in Xuzhou, the 棚子 in Xi'an, and the 脚行 in Tianjin. They internally engaged in infighting, backstabbing, and power struggles. Whoever was the most brutal and ruthless became the ruler. Nicknames such as "Four Overlords," "Five Poisons," "Ten Evils," "Living阎王 (King of Hell)," "Invincible General," "Big Show," "Little Eight Immortals," "Five Tigers, Eight Generals," and "Thirty-Six Strongmen, Seventy-Two Dogs" fully demonstrate their ferocity and brutality.

　　Feudal leaders colluded with officials and bandits, used their wealth and influence to ingratiate themselves with "powerful figures," presented gifts during festivals, and offered tributes during celebrations, engaging in open bribery. Wuhan bosses gave gold bars as gifts during festivals. Yin Qizhou bribed with 80,000 silver dollars to seize the Dazhimen 码头. The seven concubines of the pseudo-mayor Xu Huizhi all "ate dry shares" at the 码头. They brutally oppressed and abused the workers in every possible way. Zhang Yunshan, the boss of Bengbu, privately set up a court in his home, using black and red sticks to beat workers, raping workers' wives and daughters. If workers were dissatisfied, they would be "punished by family law," either severely beaten or suspended from work (not allowed to work). At over seventy years old, he forcibly married a seventeen-year-old girl as a concubine. His son, Zhang Xiaoyun, attached himself to the enemy and puppets, serving as a plainclothes team member, shooting and killing more than ten people. Cui Ganchen shot and killed the family members of anti-Japanese soldiers, and the family members were not allowed to cry when collecting the body. Workers at the "Red House" in Dalian could not bear the abuse. In the spring of 1941, 3,000 people died from illness. The boss of the Qicun 脚行 in Tianjin had a disagreement with Zhai Da and killed a worker, falsely accusing Zhai Da of the murder, and used money to buy Zhai Da's death in prison. Yang Dehai, the 搂包 (bundle-carrying) boss in Beijing, killed worker Xu Yubin and threw him into the river because of a dispute over money distribution. Liang Tiansheng, a worker in Changsha, demanded a settlement of the 码头 accounts and was poisoned to death by the boss with a rotten throat medicine. Feudal leaders used vicious and barbaric methods such as丢包 (throwing people into the river in sacks), framing, and shooting in the dark to suppress worker resistance.

　　They served as spies in the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Military Statistics Bureau. Xu Zheren, the boss of Nanchang, and Zhao Shibin, the boss of Wuhan, manipulated elections, coerced workers to join party and league superstition spy organizations, or signed up on behalf of the workers. Old workers over fifty years old in Wuhu were also members of the Three People's Principles Youth League. The Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League in Hengyang had disagreements and incited workers to fight each other, using workers as sacrifices in their power struggles. They used secret society, 红帮 (Red Gang), Buddhist Association, Yiguandao, Black Flag Team, Danbai Party, and other secret agent bandit organizations, using gang rules and religious rules to bind and rule workers. The bosses of Jiujiang divided the 码头 based on 红帮 and 山头 (mountain strongholds) (Dahan Mountain, Baohua Mountain, etc.). The bosses of Guangzhou used the National Martial Arts Society to control 搬运 operations. Many places in Shantou, Guangzhou, and Nanchang used clan relationships to carry out rule and exploitation. People of the same surname controlled the work in a certain area, and the boss was also the head of the family, using so-called family meetings and family rules to rule the workers. The Li family gang in Shantou and the Luo family 把 in Nanchang are examples of this situation. Strong clans do good work, and weak clans do secondary work. Within the same surname, there are also differences in the quality of work between嫡系 (direct descendants) and 旁系 (collateral relatives). Workers call the boss's confidants "Imperial Guards." Feudal bosses form gangs with fellow villagers, assign relatives and friends, and swear brotherhood, colluding and exploiting each other. For example, Wuxi is divided into the Hubei gang and the Wuxi gang; Xuzhou is divided into the Yutai faction and the Lincheng faction, fighting and搶活 (competing for work); Xinxiang also has disagreements between Gaocun and Wangcun.

　　The history of this feudal system is very long: the 码头 in Changsha originated in the Song Dynasty; the 把 in Nanchang originated in the Ming Dynasty; the 脚行 in Tianjin started in the early Qing Dynasty, and most other places also began to control during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, with hereditary succession. The bosses in Wuxi passed down for eleven generations. They had "contracts," "箩契 (basket contracts)," and "扁担 (carrying poles)" as proof of inheritance, rent, and sale. The initial formation was that some were indigenous residents who controlled 搬运; some were given special privileges for building railways, docks, establishing concessions, and building foreign firms that occupied their land. The East Station freight yard in Tianjin was issued official approvals and dragon tickets by the Qing Dynasty. Changsha built "public houses" at the 码头 to cope with official duties, slowly forming a partitioned territory. Some foreign firms, bureaucrats, and merchants sent their own henchmen to monopolize control. For many years, there were struggles, fights, and group brawls. Feudal bosses used force, showed off their strength, and sold their toughness, with internal fights and external encroachments, drawing dead lots, and reporting bravery, even using barbaric methods such as chopping people, throwing themselves into the river, wearing iron shoes, and jumping into oil cauldrons to compete for possession. The boss's small groups emphasized loyalty and sacrificed for the feudal group. The families of the dead were compensated, and the children were educated, all of which were the responsibility of their group, with no regrets. The timid drew dead lots or were killed by their own group, framing the other side, or hating the other side to death, to pay for their lives. In short, drawing a dead lot determined that they would become a sacrifice on the battlefield. In the Jiujiang 码头, more than seventy people were killed or injured in mutual disputes for more than ten years (from 1930 to 1948). The bosses in the south were generally "proficient in martial arts." Pan Di of Guangzhou could box and recruited many apprentices, colluding with local thugs to establish the "Pan Di Hall," which occupied the right to work in a part of the 码头. In Wuhan, the saying goes: "To fight for the 码头, the strong are king, using more people to overwhelm fewer people, equal to the big eating the small." Zhang Si in Tianjin boiled oil in a cauldron a hundred years ago and had his family members jump in and fry, monopolizing the four 口脚行 (porterage firms); Sixty years ago, the Ji family building and the 火神庙 (Fire God Temple) fought for territory, gathering crowds to brawl, with more than five hundred people participating in the melee and more than two hundred people injured and falling to the ground. Feudal bosses incited workers to fight and争 (compete) for places, boundaries, and lucrative work. As a result, it was the workers who fought, and it was the workers who suffered, but the special privileges that were争 (competed) for were for the bosses to enjoy.

　　As a result of the争 (competition), a feudal separatist situation was formed, monopolizing 搬运 operations. Outsiders were not allowed to enter the boundary to transport goods, and merchants within the boundary were not allowed to hire people or搬运 themselves; otherwise, they had to pay "过街钱 (crossing street money)," "买路钱 (toll)," "扣头 (deductions)," treat them to meals, and apologize. The 码头 in Wuxi signed contracts and set their own boundaries; the pseudo-Social Bureau in Tianjin issued blueprints for 脚行; Nanchang divided the city into a grid, forming many feudal "kingdoms" each occupying one side. They not only divided the areas but also classified the businesses. Luggage班 (teams) were not allowed to load and unload groceries, and grocery班 were not allowed to load and unload fresh goods. The Huangzhong section of the Zhenjiang 码头 was divided into salt班, grocery班, and fir班. The Wuhan 板车 (flatbed carts) were divided into cotton, medicinal materials, seafood, and cloth transportation. No one could pull other goods. The Changxi 码头 in Changsha loaded and unloaded staple grains, and the Shanxin 码头 loaded and unloaded miscellaneous grains; There was also a "贮箕会 (storage basket association)," and the goods to be transported uphill had to be transported exclusively by them. The three-wheeled拖车 (trailers) in the Shanghai fish market were only allowed to be transported by trucks by 30%, and fighting would occur if more was transported.

　　(2) Cruel Exploitation

　　Feudal bosses, relying on deeply rooted feudal forces and the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's party, league, and gang factions, carried out cruel exploitation of workers. They controlled the distribution rights of 搬运 fees, directly contacting cargo owners. Workers did not dare to ask how much the freight was. The bosses deceived and蒙蔽 (hoodwinked), demanding more from merchants, arbitrarily distributing it to workers. They would give more if they were happy and less if they were unhappy. The bosses' moods affected the amount of income workers received. The "搂包 (bundle-carrying) bosses" in Beijing exploited 大车 (large cart) workers. The workers said it was "selling themselves to the master"; Tao Zhigang, the 把头 (gang leader) in Jinan, contracted to transport goods for 600 yuan and hired workers for 200 yuan. A 把头 earned more than 500 jin of millet per day without doing any work, while workers only earned 6 jin of millet for a day's work. The amount each worker received in Wuxi was entirely determined orally by the boss on New Year's Eve each year.

　　Most of the bosses extracted a percentage, with the boss taking double or half of the daily income. Some even took 80%. The big boss in Shantou first deducted 55%, the second boss deducted another 33%, and the remaining 12% was shared by the workers. Zhang Yunshan, the big boss in Bengbu, exploited daily income equal to 180 times the worker's income. Bosses used methods such as擦叉 (erasing marks), 打圈 (drawing circles), 偷点 (stealing counts), 趁牌 (taking advantage of cards), 吃零头 (eating the small change), and 打折扣 (giving discounts) to exploit workers.

　　The second was obligatory labor. The bosses made a fortune through exploitation, opened businesses, and did business. Their own goods were transported by workers free of charge. Workers suffered priceless labor exploitation.

　　When the boss got married, had a funeral, celebrated a full moon, had a birthday, or moved houses, the workers had to give gifts. The amount of gifts given was used to assess the worker's loyalty to the boss. Workers in Wuxi had to take ham, chicken, and fish to "show respect" to the boss during the Spring Festival, preferring not to eat themselves, but daring not to fail to send New Year's gifts. Zhang Yunshan, the boss of Bengbu, liked鰱鱼 (silver carp). The workers used more than two days' wages to buy鲤鱼 (carp) to send, but were scolded.

　　The bosses raised money from everyone to hire lawyers and write lawsuits in order to compete for territory. The Yangan 码头 and Xihu 码头 in Changsha competed for transportation boundaries, and the lawsuit lasted for fifteen years. The boss falsely reported expenses and enriched himself. The pseudo-trade union in Shantou extracted welfare funds from workers on a monthly basis, which were all used to collude with the government for lobbying fees. Issuing car permits, inspecting car licenses, conscripting soldiers, requisitioning grain, and conscripting officials all made money from each thing. The more chaotic the world, the more ways the boss had to make money, so they often provoked discord, created something out of nothing, stirred up trouble, and feared that the world would not be in chaos.

　　The bosses set up casinos, and workers who lost gambling had to work to pay off debts, lend money at high interest rates, open theaters, and open opium dens. The owners of three-wheeled vehicles and horse-drawn carriages in Dalian built small houses and forced workers to live in them, and they had to pay rent even if they didn't live in them. They signed contracts with brothels, allowing workers to visit even if they didn't have money and could owe debts, and the owners deducted the money at the end of the month, doing everything possible to deprive the workers of their hard-earned money.

　　Most of these feudal bosses were very wealthy. Some opened hotels, some opened warehouses, bathhouses, theaters, and brothels. They had real estate in the city and land in the countryside and married several concubines. Yi Xiangtai, the big boss in Wuhan, was a type of person who specialized in martial arts and relied on fighting for a living. He bribed with money to become the director. Each of the 470 groups had to pay him 4-5 silver dollars a day. He had houses and land and a private car; Hu Zhengtao in Nanchang and Ba Yanqing in Tianjin were rich and powerful, manipulated elections, and became pseudo-National Assembly representatives; Ji Daozhu Yu Deshun in Beijing earned 30,000 jin of corn a month, had forty houses in the city, and 2,000 mu of land in the countryside; Zou Dingsheng, the boss in Wuxi, exploited 1,000 shi of rice in four years; Luo Zhusan, the boss in Nanchang, had 400 carrying poles; The Fengjia 码头 in Changsha (490 workers), the boss fabricated accounts, embezzled public funds, and spent more than 23,000 silver dollars in ten months in 1949. They took the workers' blood and sweat and squandered it arbitrarily, doing whatever they wanted, while the workers had no clothes or food, causing extreme poverty, leading to widespread theft, and throwing goods at will to vent their anger. Under the rule of these feudal, bureaucratic, and imperialist lackeys, they swallowed their anger and lived through difficult years.

　　(3) High-Price Extortion

　　把头, 帮头, 包工头, 脚行头, etc., controlled and divided, monopolized 搬运, extorted high prices, and fabricated various pretexts. In Bengbu, goods were unloaded from the ship into the warehouse, which had to go through thirteen procedures such as顶档 (top gear), 驳连 (barge connection), 挖仓 (digging warehouse), and 冲斗 (charging bucket), and four types of people had to work. In Nanchang, unloading ship goods required fifteen kinds of expenses such as 河保 (river insurance), 吊档 (hanging gear), 搭脚 (setting foot), and 缝袋 (sewing bags). Hooking and shouldering also cost money. If you didn't pay the package money (meaning insurance), you would lose the goods. The Wuhan 码头 divided the work into twenty-one types such as挑 (carrying), 抬 (lifting), 夯 (ramming), 堆 (stacking), 下 (down), 装舱 (loading cabin), and 打关 (checking). The boss in Zhenjiang insisted on charging a care fee and chicken feed; 5% was added for清舱 (clearing cabin) and speeding up in Wuhu. In addition, there were saving money, wine money, errand fee, extra money for rain, extra money for the New Year, extra money for helping with water when the river rises, extra money for helping with the beach when the water falls, and extra money for helping with伏 (lying down) when the weather gets hot. Every move added money and increased prices, making 搬运 costs incredibly high. The 搬运 fee for moving goods from the ship to the store in Bengbu was equal to the freight from Xuzhou to Bengbu. The labor cost of moving from the ship to the 码头 in Changsha was higher than the freight from Xiangtan to Changsha by boat; Unloading ten boats of goods from Nanmen to Dongmen in Wenzhou required 2,000 jin of rice; The 搬运 workers in the yarn factory in Jiujiang sold their land and bought the right to work with the boss. The increase in 搬运 prices seriously affected the exchange of goods.

　　　　II. Situation After Liberation

　　After liberation, workers in various cities generally had the idea and demand for revenge and liquidation. In individual places, they borrowed food from the boss, complained to the trade union, and sued the government. Some of the feudal bosses with heinous crimes fled. For example, Yi Xiangtai in Wuhan and Xiao Kuaisheng in Tianjin followed the special agent bandits and fled far away. Some were driven out by the workers. However, many bosses continued to exploit the workers, standing on the workers' heads, spreading rumors, threatening, and intimidating. Chen Haozu, the boss of Shanghai, organized a fake trade union in an attempt to continue to rule. Workers had concerns in the early days of liberation. Some believed that "following the boss can eat" and "cannot stand firm without the boss's territory." The boss took despicable means to attack activists, slander the work cadres, and incite workers not to approach the cadres, preparing to maintain their ruling privileges with tenacious resistance. The boss in Zhenjiang instigated workers to争装 (compete to load) pocket goods; The boss in Bengbu encouraged workers to争 (compete) for small platforms; The boss in Tianjin went to Beijing to sue; The boss in Shantou held a family meeting in the ancestral hall in the countryside and entertained the clan members; When the workers in Baoji held a meeting, the boss wanted to throw a grenade. However, after the work in various cities was carried out one after another, workers' symposiums, mass meetings, and representative meetings were held, and the workers' awareness gradually increased. Short-term training classes were held in Shanghai, Bengbu, Nanchang, Tianjin, and other places. The trained workers became activists and backbones, combined with recruiting members and establishing trade union organizations. The workers' strength grew day by day, demanding to fight with the boss. With the cooperation of the people's regime, Beijing detained the "搂包 (bundle-carrying) bosses" with heinous crimes; Wuhan struggled with the bully boss Yin Shibao; Xuzhou struggled with Jiang Wenju, the old boss of the Anqing Gang who had been hereditary for three generations; Bengbu executed the bosses Zhang Xiaoyun and Cui Ganchen and confiscated their exploited property; The Tianjin Public Security Bureau convened bosses for a lecture, prohibiting them from activities, and detaining the main criminals with obvious bad deeds. In this way, individual cities knocked down the bully bosses who were heinous and hated by everyone. However, their remnants still exist, hiding and secretly manipulating, and their ambitions will not die, with the illusion that "the mountain is still there, the tiger will come again." Many cities have not taken decisive measures to knock down these labor contractors, gang leaders, and 脚行 bosses and establish a new system. Therefore, in the 搬运 business, there are still: occupying territory, using bad rules,码头争界限 (docks competing for boundaries), vehicles爭运输 (competing for transportation), conflicts between the army, institutions and even prison inmate labor teams and workers, disputes between shops and farmers搬运ing themselves and workers, disputes over拉人拉货 (pulling people and pulling goods), uneven work for workers, unbalanced income, those who are full are full, and those who are hungry are hungry. Among the 26,613 码头 workers in Wuhan, only 556 people in six 码头 had particularly good income, and the rest were half unemployed. Nanchang nationalized the 码头, abolished the owners and 把头, and merged forty-eight 把 into eight teams, but this has not been properly resolved. Some cities have gradually resolved it, the method: One is to establish a transportation company to uniformly contract business and uniformly allocate labor. Tianjin was established in July 1949, and Bengbu and Jinan followed suit. Wuhan, Nanchang, and other places are also planning to establish; One is to organize 搬运 labor cooperatives. Dalian, Tanggu, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places have been established one after another, collective labor, common division of money, mutual adjustment, and allocation. The establishment of these two organizations solved the problems of 争活打架 (competing for work and fighting) and unbalanced income.

　　The second is that there is a lack of reasonable regulations on 搬运 fees. The phenomenon of agreeing on the spot when搬运 goods and then asking for more still exists in many cities. In Bengbu, workers were asked to take a woman's package on board and were not paid, and three pieces of clothes were used to offset the labor fee; The freight rates in Jinan are high, and rural food绕过 (detours around) the city to other places. Although Wuxi, Nanchang, and other places have stipulated 搬运 price lists, they are not perfect and have several problems.

　　After liberation, there were more 搬运 workers than work in various cities. Some cities had rural farmers gathering in the city to participate in 搬运, generally forming a surplus of labor (except for Yingkou in the Northeast). In general, there were one-third to one-half more in each city, and in individual cases, there were two-thirds more. The monthly income of workers in Xuzhou was only enough for ten days of living. 6,811 people had 1,509 unemployed, 111 households sold平车 (flat carts) and clothes, most ate bean cakes, and some sold their children; Kaifeng also had more cars than work, and it was impossible to maintain their lives. Two workers hanged themselves. They are now expanding the scope of work and trying to save themselves. Workers in Kaifeng transport salt to the countryside for sale and buy miscellaneous grains into the city; Workers in Xuzhou contract to repair airports and martyrs' towers and sell yellow basins, vermicelli, sweet potatoes, vegetables, etc., to solve temporary life. Many cities have not yet found appropriate solutions to the surplus of labor, and workers are requesting to be安置 (placed) and转业 (transferred to other jobs).

　　全国搬运工人情况报告
    中国搬运工会全国委员会
    根据全国五十个城市手头材料的统计（缺西南区），搬运工人共五六八、五八四人，包括有码头、车辆运输、装卸、三轮车（一八七、三七○人）等工人在内。个别城市有水业、粪业、拉骆驼、打石头以及船夫等。
    现在各市、县城、镇普遍的建立起搬运工会及筹委会的组织，据今年一月份的统计，以上五十个城市共计会员为三一三、七六八人，占工人总数的百分之五十五。建立职业工会七一一个，分会组织四八七个，支会组织六二五个，会员小组一一、○一八个。
            一、解放前的封建剥削制度
    （一）统治割据
    各城市的搬运工人，遭受到把头、帮头、包工头、脚行头的黑暗统治和奴役。这类封建头子，对外把持，对内压榨，他们有钱、有势、有打手、有诉棍，打官司有律师，打架有流氓恶棍。他们霸占住一定的地区，垄断着搬运业务。像武汉的码头（南方的码头包括水旱两种）、南昌的把、徐州的大柜、西安的棚子、天津的脚行等。他们内部互相倾轧，勾心斗角，争权夺势，谁蛮横凶狠，谁就成了统治者。“四霸天”、“五毒”、“十大恶”、“活阎王”、“无敌将军”、“大把戏”、“小八仙”、“五虎、八将”、“三十六大汉、七十二只犬”等等，这些绰号，就充分表现出他们的凶恶蛮横。
    封建头子勾结官匪，利用财势，谄媚“权贵”，年节馈送，喜庆献礼，公行贿赂。武汉头子年节用金条送礼，殷其周拿八万银元行贿争夺大智门码头，伪市长徐会之的七个小老婆，都在码头“吃干股”。他们对工人横行压迫，百般蹂躏。蚌埠头子张云山，家中私设公堂，用黑红棍拷打工人，奸淫工人的妻女，工人不满，就以“家法惩处”，不是毒打，就是停班（不准做工），年过七十强娶十七岁的姑娘作小老婆。其子张小云依附敌伪，充当便衣队，枪杀人命十余条。崔干臣枪杀抗日军人家属，家属收尸不准哭。大连的“红房子”工人不堪虐待，一九四一年春天，病死了三千人。天津七村脚行的头子和翟大不和，就杀了工人硬赖翟大杀的，用钱把翟大买死狱中。北京搂包头子杨德海因为分钱闹意见，杀死工人许玉斌扔在河里。长沙工人梁天胜要求清算码头账目，被头子用烂喉药毒死。封建头子用丢包（将人装在布袋内扔进河里）、栽赃、打黑枪等毒辣野蛮手段，来镇压工人的反抗。
    他们在国民党、三青团，在军统当特务。南昌的头子徐哲仁、武汉的赵世斌，操纵选举，胁迫工人加入党团迷信特务组织，或代替工人报名参加。芜湖年过五十的老工人，也是三青团的团员；衡阳的国民党与三青团不和，唆使工人互相械斗，把工人充作他们争权夺势的牺牲品。他们在青帮、红帮、佛教会、一贯道、黑旗队、单白党等特务盗匪组织，利用帮规教规，束缚统治工人。九江的头子在红帮、分山头（大汉山、保华山等）割据码头；广州的头子利用国术社，把持住搬运业务。汕头、广州、南昌等地很多是利用乡族宗姓关系，进行统治剥削，一个姓氏的族人，把持着一个地区的工作，头子也是家长，用所谓家族会议，家规家法，统治着工人。汕头的李家班，南昌的罗家把，都是这种情形。强族作好活，弱族作次活，同姓之内，嫡系旁系在工作的好坏上也有区别。工人把头子的亲信叫做“御林军”。封建头子同乡结帮，亲友分派，盟兄把弟，换帖交友，狼狈勾结，互相利用。像无锡分成湖北帮和无锡帮；徐州分为鱼台派和临城派，争活打架抢工作；新乡也是高村跟王村不和，互闹意见。
    这种封建制度的历史很久：长沙的码头，始自宋代；南昌的把，起自明朝；天津的脚行从清初，其他各地也多自明、清就开始把持，子孙世袭、世代相传。无锡的头子传了十一代。他们有“签”，有“箩契”，有“扁担”，作为遗传、出租和出卖的凭据。最初的形成，有的是土著居民，把持搬运；有的是修铁路，建码头，开辟租界，修盖洋行占用他们的土地，许给他们的特权。天津的东站货场，清朝发给他们官批、龙票；长沙为应付公差，在码头修盖“公屋”，慢慢形成了割据。有的外国洋行、官僚商号，自派爪牙，垄断把持，多少年来都经过了争夺打架，械斗群殴。封建头子用武力，耍胳臂根，卖硬骨头，内部火拚，外来侵占，抽死签，报奋勇，甚至用铡人、投河、穿铁鞋、跳油锅等野蛮手段，争夺霸占。头子小集团间，讲义气，为封建集团牺牲，死者家属抚恤，子孙教养，统由他们集团负责，决不反悔。胆小的抽上死签，或由本集团杀死，诬陷对方，或恨死对方，用来抵命，总之抽上死签，就确定成了格斗场上的牺牲品。九江码头互相争夺，十余年来（一九三○年至四八年）死伤七十余人。南方的头子普遍的“精通武艺”，广州的潘狄能打拳，广收徒弟，勾结地痞，成立“潘狄馆”，就霸占一部码头的工作权。武汉流行话：“打码头，强者为王，以人多压人少，等于大吃小。”百年前天津张四，烧滚油锅，使其族人跳入炸焦，就独霸四口脚行；六十年前季家楼与火神庙争夺地界，聚众群殴，参加械斗的五百余人，受伤倒地的二百余人。封建头子教唆工人争夺打架，争地方，争界限，争挣钱多的工作。结果打架的是工人，受祸的是工人，但争来的特权，却供头子作乐享福。
    争夺的结果，形成封建割据局面，垄断着搬运业务。外人不能进界运货，界内商民更不能随便雇人或者自己搬运；不然，要“过街钱”、“买路钱”，要“扣头”、请吃饭、赔罪道歉。无锡的码头，互订契约，自订界限；天津伪社会局为脚行制发蓝图；南昌市内划成格子网，形成许多各霸一方的封建“王国”。他们不但地区分割而且业务分类，行李班不能装卸杂货，杂货班又不能装卸鲜货。镇江码头黄中段，又分盐班、杂货班和杉木班，武汉板车分成棉花、药材、海味、匹头等类的运输，谁也不拉别的货。长沙的长西码头装卸主粮，善新码头装卸杂粮；另外还有“贮箕会”，上坡须量的货物由他们专运。上海鱼市场的三轮拖车，只允卡车运三成，多运就打架。
    （二）残酷剥削
    封建头子凭借根深蒂固的封建势力，依靠蒋匪的党团帮派的统治，对工人进行残酷的剥削。他们掌握着搬运费的分配权，直接和货主联系，工人不敢问运价多少，头子们欺骗蒙蔽，向商人多要，随意分发工人，高兴就多给，不高兴时少给，头子们的喜怒哀乐，影响到工人收入的多寡。北京“搂包头子”剥削大车工人，工人说是“随爷卖”；济南把头陶志刚以六百元揽运货，花二百元钱雇工人，一个把头一点力气不花，每天能获利五百多斤小米，工人劳动一天只得小米六斤。无锡工人谁分多少，全在每年除夕头子的口头决定。
    多数的头子是抽成分份，每日的收入头子分双份，分对半，有的硬分百分之八十。汕头的大头子是先扣百分之五十五，二头子再扣百分之三十三，余下的百分之十二，才由工人共同分。蚌埠大头子张云山，每日剥削收入等于工人收入的一八○倍。头子利用擦叉、打圈、偷点、趁牌、吃零头、打折扣等手段剥削工人。
    其次是义务劳役，头子剥削发了财，开买卖，作生意，自己的货物，是由工人无偿的搬运，工人受着无价的劳役剥削。
    头子婚丧嫁娶，满月，过寿，搬家盖房，都要工人送礼，以送礼的多少，来作为考察工人对头子的忠实与否。无锡工人逢年过节都要拿火腿、鸡、鱼，去“孝敬”头子，宁肯自己不吃，年礼不敢不送。蚌埠头子张云山欢喜鲢鱼，工人们用了两天多的工资买了鲤鱼送去，结果挨了一顿骂。
    头子们为了争夺地盘，请律师、写状打官司，都是由工人大家凑钱。长沙的宴公码头和西湖码头争运界，官司打了十五年，头子捏报用费，从中中饱发了财。汕头的伪工会按月抽提工人福利费，都用作勾结官府的运动费。发车证，验车牌，征兵，征粮，征官差，每作一件事就赚一笔钱，天下越乱，头子发财之道越多，所以他们经常是在挑拨离间，无中生有，兴风作浪，惟恐天下不乱。
    头子们设赌场，工人赌输，加工还债，放高利贷，开戏院，开烟馆。大连三轮、马车主盖小房强迫工人住，不住也要交房租。跟妓女院订契约，允许工人没钱欠账可以逛，业主月底代扣钱，把工人辛苦所得，想尽办法剥夺而去。
    这些封建头子多数是家财万贯，有的开旅馆，有的开货栈、澡堂、戏院、妓女院，城市有房产，乡村有田地，娶几个小老婆。武汉大头子易祥泰，是专门搞武术靠打吃饭的一类人，用钱贿赂当了理事长，四七○组每组每天要交他银洋四、五元，有房有地有私人自备的小汽车；南昌的胡正涛、天津巴延庆等，都是有钱有势，操纵选举当了伪国大代表；北京的冀道主于德顺每月收入玉米三万斤，城里有房四十所，乡间土地两千亩；无锡头子邹定生，四年剥削大米一千石；南昌头子罗祝三，有四百条扁担；长沙冯家码头（工人四九○人），头子虚造账目，侵吞公款，一九四九年十个月内就用去二万三千多银洋。他们拿着工人的血汗，任意挥霍，为所欲为，而工人无衣无食，造成极端的贫困，以致普遍形成偷窃的现象，对货物随扔随掷，发泄出气，在这些封建、官僚、帝国主义走狗的统治下，忍气吞声，度着艰难的岁月。
    （三）高价勒索
    把头、帮头、包工头、脚行头等把持割据，垄断搬运，高价勒索，巧立名目。蚌埠的货物由船上卸入仓库，要经过顶档、驳连、挖仓、冲斗等十三道手续，要换四种人干活。南昌的船货卸落，要花河保、吊档、搭脚、缝袋等十五种花费，挂勾、起肩也要钱，不花包钱（保险费之意）要丢货。武汉码头将工作划分为挑、抬、夯、堆、下、装舱、打关等二十一种。镇江头子硬要照料费、喂鸡米；芜湖的清舱、加快都要加百分之五。此外节钱、酒钱、听差费，下雨加钱，过年加钱，河里水涨要加帮水钱，水落要加帮滩钱，天气热了还要加上帮伏钱，一举一动的加钱增价，使搬运费用无比的提高。蚌埠的货物从船上搬到店铺的搬运费，等于从徐州到蚌埠的运费，长沙从船上搬到码头的力资，比从湘潭用船运到长沙的运费还要高；温州南门到东门十船货的卸力要二千斤米；九江的纱厂搬运工人卖了田地也跟头子买工作权。搬运价的提高，严重的影响了物资的交流。
            二、解放后的情况
    解放后，各城市工人普遍的存在报仇清算的思想和要求，个别的地方向头子借粮，向工会诉苦，到政府告状。罪大恶极的封建头子有的逃匿，像武汉的易祥泰、天津的萧魁生等都跟着特务匪帮远走。有的被工人驱逐出去。但是不少的头子还在继续剥削工人，站在工人头上，造谣言，威胁恫吓。上海头子陈灏祖组织冒牌工会，企图继续统治。工人在解放初期有顾虑，个别的认为“跟着头子有饭吃”，“取消了头子地盘站不稳”。头子采取卑鄙的手段打击积极分子，诽谤工作干部，挑拨工人不和干部接近，准备用顽强的抵抗保持他们的统治特权。镇江头子教唆工人争装口袋货；蚌埠头子鼓动工人争夺小站台；天津头子到北京告状；汕头头子在乡中公祠开家族会议，宴请族人；宝鸡工人开会，头子要扔手榴弹。但经过各城市工作的先后开展，召开工人座谈会、群众大会、代表会，工人觉悟逐渐提高，上海、蚌埠、南昌、天津等地开办短期训练班，经过训练的工人都成为积极分子和骨干，结合着吸收会员，建立工会组织，工人的力量日益壮大起来，要求同头子斗争。在人民政权力量的配合下，北京扣押罪大恶极的“搂包头子”；武汉斗争恶霸头子殷士宝；徐州斗争了世袭三辈安清帮的老头子姜文举；蚌埠枪毙了头子张小云、崔干臣，并没收了他们剥削所得的财产；天津公安局召集头子训话，禁止他们活动，拘捕劣迹昭著的首要分子。这样，个别的城市把罪大恶极、人人痛恨的恶霸头子打倒了。但他们的残余势力，依然存在，隐蔽起来，暗中操纵，野心不死，存在着“山在虎还来”的幻想。而不少的城市，还没有采取坚决的手段，把这些包工头、帮头、脚行头子打倒，建立起新的制度，因而搬运事业中还是：把持地界，沿用陋规，码头争界限、车辆争运输，军队、机关以至监狱犯人劳动队和工人起冲突，商店、农民自行搬运和工人闹纠纷，拉人拉货的问题起争执，工人的工作不平均，收入不平衡，饱的饱，饿的饿。武汉码头工人二六、六一三人，只有六个码头五五六人的收入特殊好，其余的半失业。南昌将码头收归国有，取消了业主、把头，合并四十八把，划分为八个队，但亦未能得到适当的解决。有些城市已逐渐的解决了，其方法：一是成立运输公司，统一承揽业务，统一调配劳动力，天津在一九四九年七月成立，蚌埠、济南相继组织，武汉、南昌等地也正在计划成立；一是组织搬运劳动合作社，大连、塘沽、开封、徐州、郑州等地已经先后成立，集体劳动，共同分钱，互相调整、调配。这两种组织的建立，解决了争活打架，收入不平衡的问题。
    其次是搬运费缺乏合理的规定，许多的城市搬运货物，当面讲好，借端再要的现象仍存在，蚌埠工人替女人拿包裹上船，要钱没有，用三件衣服折了工力费；济南运价高，农村食粮绕过城市到旁处去。无锡、南昌等地虽然规定搬运价目表，但还不完善，并有若干问题。
    解放后，各城市搬运工人人多活少，有的城市乡村农民聚集城市参加搬运，普遍的形成劳动力过剩（东北地区除营口外无此现象），各城市一般的多出三分之一到二分之一，个别的多出三分之二，徐州工人每月收入只足十天的生活，六、八一一人，有一、五○九人失业，卖平车、衣服的一一一户，大部分的吃豆饼，有的卖了小孩；开封也是车多没活做，生活无法维持，两个工人上吊自杀，他们现正扩展工作范围，设法自救。开封工人，运盐下乡出卖，再买杂粮进城；徐州工人包修飞机场、烈士塔，以及贩卖黄盆、粉条、红芋、青菜等，来解决暂时的生活，许多的城市对劳动力过剩，还没有适当的办法解决，工人要求安置转业。
