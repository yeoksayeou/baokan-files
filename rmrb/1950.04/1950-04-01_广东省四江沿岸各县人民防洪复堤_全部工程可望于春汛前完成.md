Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 30th. The people of various counties along the East, West, North, and Han Rivers in Guangdong Province are now actively engaged in flood prevention and embankment restoration work. The terrain within Guangdong Province is high in the northwest and low in the southeast. During the rainy season, mountain floods from the upper reaches of the rivers rush rapidly downstream, coupled with tidal surges from the sea, making it impossible for the river floods to be discharged. This often causes the dikes and embankments in the lower reaches of the rivers to collapse, resulting in floods. Last year's floods were particularly severe in the West and North Rivers, where the main dikes of nine counties including Gaoyao, Qingyuan, and Xinhui along the rivers were mostly breached by the floods, submerging over 800,000 mu of paddy fields and affecting over 400,000 disaster victims. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the Provincial People's Government dispatched personnel to the disaster areas to conduct surveys and established the Provincial Flood Prevention and Embankment Restoration Committee at the beginning of this year to uniformly lead the embankment restoration work for all rivers. The province's dike repair projects include fourteen counties along the East, West, and North Rivers, including Huiyang, Qingyuan, and Gaoyao, requiring a total of 7.2 million cubic meters of earthwork to be completed. In order to complete the above tasks, the local people's governments, after convening meetings of representatives from various polders and mass meetings of polder residents, mobilized the people to rush-repair the dikes and embankments through a system of reasonable burdens. They also put forward the slogan "Block Breaches and Restore Embankments, Prevent Floods and Protect Homes," mobilizing the people of various places to enthusiastically participate in this work. In the nine counties along the West and North Rivers alone, more than 30,000 people went to work on the dikes every day. From January to mid-March, according to incomplete statistics, over 1.36 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed in the West and North Rivers, accounting for more than 35% of the total earthwork required for the West and North River projects. 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork had been completed in the East River, and a portion had also been completed in the Han River. The remaining projects are expected to be completed before the spring flood season. The local troops have enthusiastically participated in the construction of dikes and embankments. For example, the repair time for the Touxi Polder, the main dike of the West River, and the Shuikou Dam, the main dike of the East River, has been shortened due to the participation of the local troops. In order to combine the repair of dikes with disaster relief work, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 2,000 tons of loan grain to implement work-for-relief. Each of the more than 2,000 disaster victims repairing the Touxi Polder can receive three jin of wage rice per day, and their living problems have thus been solved.

　　广东省四江沿岸各县人民防洪复堤
    全部工程可望于春汛前完成
    【新华社广州三十日电】广东省东、西、北、韩四江沿岸各县人民现正积极进行防洪复堤工作。广东省境内地势西北高东南低，每当雨水季节，各江上游山洪急激冲向下游，加以海面潮汐涨入，各江洪水无从宣泄，常使各江下游堤围溃决，造成水灾。去年水患以西、北江较为严重，沿江高要、清远、新会等九县干堤大部被洪水冲决，淹没稻田八十余万亩，灾民达四十余万人。广州解放后，该省人民政府为免除水患，即派人前往灾区进行勘查，并于今年初成立省防洪复堤委员会统一领导各江复堤工作。全省修堤工程包括东、西、北各江沿岸惠阳、清远、高要等十四县，共需完成土方七百二十万立方公尺。为完成上述任务，各地人民政府经过召开各围代表会议和围民大会，以合理负担的办法动员人民抢修堤围，并提出“堵口复堤、防洪保家”的口号，动员各地人民热烈地参加这一工作。仅西、北江沿岸九个县每日就有三万余人上堤工作。自一月间到三月中旬，据不完全的统计，西、北江业已完成土方一百三十六万余立方公尺，占西、北江全部工程所需土方的百分之三十五强；东江完成土方五十万立方公尺，韩江亦完成一部。其余工程可望于春汛前全部完成。各地驻军都热烈地参加了修筑堤围工作，如西江之主要干堤头溪围和东江之主要干堤水口坝，就因为当地驻军的参加而缩短了修堤时间。广东省人民政府为使修复堤与救灾工作相结合，曾拨发贷款谷二千余吨，实行以工代赈。头溪围二千余修堤灾民每人每日可得工资米三斤，其生活问题已因此获得解决。
