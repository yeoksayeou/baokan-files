Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Despite the severe suppression measures taken by the Dutch government at the instigation of US imperialism, the Dutch people still held a mass rally in The Hague on April 1st to demand peace, protesting the series of war-preparatory military meetings recently held in The Hague by the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. As early as the end of March, delegations of workers from various places and "peace travel teams" arrived in The Hague one after another, issuing protests demanding the termination of these military meetings. Therefore, according to a report by the United Press, the Dutch government, on the day before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense Committee meeting (March 31st), dispatched thousands of police to be on alert throughout the city and cut off all traffic to The Hague on April 1st. In addition, a part of the motorized units were dispatched to deal with the protesting crowds demanding peace. However, according to the Associated Press: The working people of The Hague and representatives from various places still held a mass rally in the old zoo.

According to TASS: In the provinces, textile workers in Enschede, dockworkers in Amsterdam, the Amersfoort branch of the Dutch-Soviet Association, and youth groups in Zaandam all issued protests. Tens of millions of Dutch workers combined their voices into a resolute protest against the aggressive military meetings.

The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth" newspaper editorial stated: "American generals want to turn Holland into a barracks and dream of turning the entire Western Europe into a barracks in the style of Hitler. But this will never come to fruition. The people are strengthening their resistance; they want peace and freedom."

    千万劳动人民抗议“变荷兰为兵营”的阴谋
    【新华社四日讯】不顾荷兰政府在美帝国主义唆使下所采取的严厉镇压措施，荷兰人民仍然于四月一日在海牙举行了要求和平的群众大会，以抗议北大西洋侵略集团最近在海牙举行的一连串备战军事会议。早在三月底，各地劳动人民的代表团与“和平旅行队”即陆续到达海牙，发出要求终止这些军事会议的抗议。因此，据合众社报道，荷兰政府在北大西洋公约防务委员会会议前一日（三月三十一日），即出动了上千警察在全城戒备，并于四月一日断绝通到海牙的一切交通。此外还出动了一部分摩托化部队，以对付要求和平的示威群众。但是，据美联社消息：海牙劳动人民与各地代表仍然在旧动物园举行了群众大会。
    据塔斯社报道：在外省，恩舍戴的纺织工人，阿姆斯特丹的码头工人，荷苏协会阿麦斯福特分会，桑达姆的青年团体都发出了抗议，成千成万的荷兰劳动人民把他们的呼声汇合到反对侵略性军事会议的坚决抗议中。
    荷共真理报社论称：“美国将军们要把荷兰变为兵营，梦想照希特勒的式样把整个西欧变为兵营。但是这决不会有什么结果。人民正在加强他们的反抗，他们要和平与自由。”
