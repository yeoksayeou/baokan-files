(This News) Introduction to Important Contents of the Chinese Edition, Issue 27 of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!", the Organ of the Communist and Workers' Parties

    [Our Newspaper] The recently published Chinese edition, Issue 27 (Total Issue 66) of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" includes important articles such as A. Mogilovici, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, on "The Organizational Strengthening of the Romanian Workers' Party," M. Servin, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, on "The Training of Cadres," E. Papaioannou, General Secretary of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, on "The Cypriot People's Struggle for Peace and National Liberation," and the book review "The Exposed 'Traitor International'."

    The article "The Organizational Strengthening of the Romanian Workers' Party" introduces the party's current organizational situation, pointing out that a serious shortcoming that still exists within the party is that the Leninist and Stalinist principles of absorbing new party members and consolidating the party's social composition have not been resolutely implemented. This is reflected in the fact that all those who express a willingness to join the party are absorbed into it. As a result, a large number of non-proletarian elements, petty-bourgeois elements, opportunists, and bureaucrats have infiltrated the party. In light of this situation, the party's January Central Plenum has decided to take steps to strengthen the proletarian core role to ensure the correctness of the party's social composition. The article "The Training of Cadres" by Servin similarly discusses the issue of the social composition of the French Communist Party's leadership organs, arguing that the promotion of cadres from among the workers is too slow.

    The article "The Cypriot People's Struggle for Peace and National Liberation" points out that the Cypriot people, under the leadership of the Progressive Party of the Working People, are engaged in a national liberation movement to resist British colonial rule and strive for the island's unification with Greece (because about four-fifths of the island's population are Greek). The article points out: striving for unification with Greece does not imply approval of the royalist-fascist regime established by Anglo-American imperialists in Greece.

    The book review "The Exposed 'Traitor International'" provides a brief introduction to the book "Traitor International" by Renaud de Jouvenel, which was re-published in Paris in 1949. The book records in detail treason cases in the Eastern European people's democratic countries after the Second World War, such as the Mindszenty treason case and the Mikolajczyk treason case. The book points out that a common characteristic of all these conspiracies is that not only were the "ordinary" and "regular" spies of the so-called Western powers at work, but also Anglo-American diplomatic personnel from top to bottom, from military attachés and cultural attachés to ministers and ambassadors. The book review says: Jouvenel's book aroused the anger of Anglo-American imperialism. On their orders, exiles from Romania and other countries even filed so-called "defamation" lawsuits in Paris against the author of the book, the author of the preface, and the publisher. The trial is scheduled for April 24, 1950. The book review says: This conspiracy by Anglo-American imperialists cannot suppress the voice of truth. This new performance by the lackeys of the American war-mongers is bound to fail.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第二十七期重要内容介绍
    【本报讯】最近出版的共产党与工人党机关报《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》的中文版第二十七期（总第六十六期）的重要内容有罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记Ａ·摩吉洛西的“罗马尼亚工人党组织上的加强”，法国共产党中央委员会委员Ｍ·赛尔文的“干部的训练”，赛浦鲁斯劳动人民进步党总书记Ｅ·巴巴伊奥亚诺的“赛浦鲁斯人民为争取和平与民族解放而斗争”，及书评“被揭露的‘叛徒国际’”等。
    《罗马尼亚工人党组织上的加强》一文，介绍了该党目前组织概况，指出该党目前尚存在着的一个严重缺点是列宁、斯大林的吸收新党员入党以及整顿党的社会成份的原则还没有坚决地实行。这表现在所有表示愿意参加党的群众都被吸收入党。结果大量的非无产阶级的成份，小资产阶级、机会主义者以及事务主义者都侵入了党。鉴于这种情况，该党一月份的中央全会已决定采取步骤加强无产阶级核心作用来保证党的社会成份的正确性。赛尔文所作《干部的训练》一文，同样地论到法国共产党的领导机构的社会成份的问题，认为在工人中间提拔干部是太缓慢了。
    《赛浦鲁斯人民为争取和平与民族解放而斗争》一文，指出赛浦鲁斯人民正在劳动人民进步党的领导下，进行反抗英国殖民地统治和争取该岛与希腊合并的民族解放运动（因该岛五分之四左右是希腊人）。该文指出：争取与希腊合并，并不含有赞同英美帝国主义者在希腊所设立的保皇法西斯政权的意思。
    书评“被揭露了的‘叛徒国际’”，扼要地介绍了一九四九年在巴黎重版的雷诺·德·茹维纳尔所著《叛徒国际》一书。该书详细记录了第二次世界大战以后东欧各人民民主国家中的叛国案如明曾蒂叛国案、米柯拉兹科叛国案等。该书指明了，这一切阴谋的一个共同特点就是不仅有所谓西方强国的“普通的”与“正规的”间谍在起作用，而且有从上到下的英美外交人员在起作用，从军事参赞与文化参赞，直到公使与大使。书评说：茹维尔这一本书引起英美帝国主义的怒气。根据他们的命令，罗马尼亚等国的流亡者竟在巴黎对该书的作者、序言的作者与出版者提起所谓“诽谤罪”的诉讼。审讯期预定为一九五○年四月二十四日。书评说：英美帝国主义者的这种阴谋，是抑止不住真理的声音的。美国战争挑拨者的走狗们的这一次新演出，是一定要失败的。
