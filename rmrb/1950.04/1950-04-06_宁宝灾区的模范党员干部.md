    Model Party Member Cadres in the Ningbao Disaster Area
        Our Correspondent An Zhenying
    In the two months of production and disaster relief work in the Ningbao (Ninghe, Baodi) severely affected area, many model cadres who shared weal and woe with the disaster victims have emerged, especially Han Tianshun, Wang Jinsheng, Yang Xiurong, Pi Shouyu, and Zhao Yaoxian.
    Han Tianshun is a 23-year-old youth. He started doing odd jobs for landlords at the age of fifteen or sixteen. At seventeen, he joined the Eighth Route Army because he could not bear the landlords’ oppression. He fought in over a hundred battles, large and small, and was wounded in four places in the battles of Jinzhou and Beidaihe in 1948, becoming a third-class honorary soldier. Wang Jinsheng is 41 years old and suffered with his parents from childhood, wandering outside his hometown for more than 20 years to escape famine. Yang Xiurong is a girl who just left school at the age of 18. Her father joined the army more than ten years ago, and her mother is a model village women's association director. She was often rated as a model student in school. Pi Shouyu, who worked as a farmhand for more than 20 years, is 51 years old, but he works with the same energy as young people. Only Zhao Yaoxian has a longer work history, working as a staff member in the sub-district public security office. They are all excellent members of the Chinese Communist Party. In January of this year, they and many other comrades were sent to work in the Ningbao severely affected area. Under the slogan of "Disaster relief is like saving lives, saving people is like fighting fire," they created extraordinary achievements.
    The area where Ninghe and Baodi meet was hit by a major flood last autumn, and the crops were not harvested. After entering winter, the lives of the masses became even more difficult, with most people eating bran and sorghum husks. Many laborers were starving, and many people lost their confidence and courage to fight.

            Sharing Weal and Woe with the Masses
    After arriving in the disaster area, they often took out their only supply of grain and ate it with the landlords as bran cakes. Because they were out working, they sometimes ate only one meal a day. Comrade Wang Jinsheng lived in the home of Village Chief Zhang in Zhanglaorenzhuang Village. He kept eating bran and got sick, coughing non-stop at night, but he kept it from the village chief. When Comrade Jinsheng visited the villagers in depth, he learned that Zhao Jianli, an old man, had been sick in bed for six days. He took three kilograms of rice from his own supply and cooked porridge for the old man. Zhao's son was moved to tears and secretly resolved, "If the cadres care about us like this, how can we not step up production?" Han Tianshun, with his legs injured several times, still kept fetching water for the landlords and the military families. They often encouraged themselves with their past circumstances, "During the Yangzhangzi battle, we fought fiercely for two days without eating. Eating some bran now is also for the people."

            Conquering Ice, Mud, and Slush
    In the freezing winter, in the muddy and icy water after the thaw, going out during the day and night was their common practice. Xiurong, so young, traveled more than ten miles on icy roads in the dark night to attend a meeting in order to rush grain transport. On another occasion, she waded through three miles of cold water more than a foot deep to reach the district office for an important matter. These things aroused the love and gratitude of the old women. Comrade Wang Jinsheng was still sick when the thaw was about to begin. He received a notice from the district to discuss production and disaster relief work. He did not hesitate to borrow a broken ice sled and went himself, but he fainted after walking more than three miles and lay on the ice for half an hour. After waking up, he rested briefly in a nearby village and still arrived at the district office that day.

            Overcoming Difficulties to Lead the Masses in Production
    During the thaw, each of them was responsible for the work of one village. In leading the masses in production, learning and teaching on the spot what they did not know was the biggest characteristic of their leadership methods. Han Tianshun, who had been wielding a gun for six or seven years, found it particularly difficult when he first came to work in the local area. He personally inspected 73 households out of the more than 100 households in Houbangzigu that were given loans of grain. From this exploration, he felt that he had some grasp of the situation. When sowing wheat, the masses had the habit of sowing only after the tenth day of the first lunar month. How to break the old habit and achieve early sowing? He went to the low-lying areas every day to look at the land. He knew in his heart which areas were dry and how much area could be sown. He asked the village cadres, "Can our village's wheat be sown?" The village cadres said, "It can't be sown until after the tenth day of the first lunar month." Little Han explained the situation in the fields clearly, persuaded the village cadres, and started sowing wheat earlier. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor and animal power for sowing wheat, Little Han personally helped Zhu Ziyou organize a mutual aid team, using this as a model to promote it to 33 teams. Houbangzigu did not know how to manage hairtail. He went to Zhukouzhuang to learn it and taught it to the masses, leading the masses to continue production during the New Year. In a short period of time, he was able to work so skillfully. Pi Shouyu was responsible for the work of Dalizhuang in the third district. When he discovered a pool of stagnant water of more than 350 mu in the southeast of the village that could be drained to grow wheat, he first investigated whose land it was and then began to organize the more than 40 households with land to dig ditches. In the stagnant water of early spring, there were still residual ice blocks. People hesitated to go into the water. Lao Pi was so anxious to drain the water that he took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Village Chief Wu Guirong was moved by this spirit and followed him into the water. Then the masses also went into the water and opened two large ditches, each two and a half feet deep and wide and nearly 30 zhang long, in half a day. He personally helped the masses pull the hoes to sow wheat, influencing the masses to pull the hoes and solving the difficulty of lacking animal power. Zhao Yaoxian, a native of the water country, had production experience. He specifically taught the villages of Caojiagu and Dutaizi how to transplant rice seedlings and raise sorghum seedlings. In order not to delay the production of the masses, when he went to the fishing nets, he managed the fish on the one hand and explained production to the masses on the other. These disaster relief models treated every village and every household like their own family. When Comrade Zhao Yaoxian was transferred to work, the men, women, old, and children of the whole village of Banjiegou came to see him off. The boat had traveled more than half a mile, and the masses were still standing at the head of the village waving goodbye.

　　宁宝灾区的模范党员干部
    本报通讯员  安振英
    宁宝（宁河、宝坻）重灾区在两月来的生产救灾工作中，涌现了不少与灾民共甘苦的模范干部，尤以韩天顺、王金生、杨秀荣、邳守玉、赵耀先为最好。
    韩天顺是二十三岁的青年。十五、六岁便给地主家扛小活，十七岁上，就因不堪地主压迫，参加了八路军。他大小仗打了百多次，一九四八年在锦州、北戴河等战斗中受了四处伤，成了三等荣誉军人。王金生四十一岁，从小跟着爹娘受苦，逃荒在外二十多年。杨秀荣是十八岁才出学堂门的女孩子，爹参军十多年，娘是个模范的村妇会主任，她在学校时就常被评为模范。当过二十多年长工的邳守玉，五十一岁了，作工作和年轻人一样有火力。只有赵耀先工作历史较长，在分区公安处当科员。他们都是中国共产党优秀的党员。今年一月他们和很多同志被派到宁宝重灾区工作。在“救灾如救命，救人如救火”的口号下，他们创造了不平凡的事迹。
    宁河、宝坻的结合地，去秋遭大水，籽粒未收，入冬以后，群众生活更苦，吃糠秕、高粱帽的占大多数。不少劳动力被饿倒，不少群众失掉了斗争的信心和勇气。
            和群众同甘共苦
    他们到灾区后常是以自己仅有的供给粮食，拿出和房东作成糠饽饽一块吃，因出去工作，有时一天吃一顿饭。王金生同志住在张老人庄村长家，连着吃糠，有病了，晚上咳嗽不止，但他瞒着村长。当金生同志深入访问时，知道赵建立老汉病的六天没起炕，他就从自己供给粮里拿出三斤米给老汉熬粥喝。感动的赵老汉的儿子大哭，暗自下决心“干部这样关心咱，咱还能不加紧生产？”韩天顺拐着几次受伤的腿，还不断给房东给军属们挑水。他们常拿过去的处境鼓励自己，“杨杖子战斗时，两天没吃饭还激烈战斗，这时吃点糠，也是为了老百姓。
            战胜冰水泥泞
    在严冬的冰天雪地里，在解冻后的泥泞冰水里，昼来夜去是他们的常事。秀荣那么小的年纪，为着突击运粮，漆黑的深夜，走过十余里的冰路去开会。又一次有要事到区，她趟过一尺多深三里地的冷水。这些事都引起老大娘们的疼爱和感激。王金生同志在天将化冻时，还病着，接到区里通知，讨论生产救灾工作，毫不犹豫地借到一个破冰床，自己乘着去了，但走出三里多地晕倒了，在冰板上躺了半个来钟头，苏醒后到附近村稍歇，仍于当天赶到区公所。
            克服困难领导群众生产
    在解冻期中，他们每人担任一个村的工作。在领导群众生产中，自己不会的现学现教，是他们领导方法上的最大特点。拿了六、七年枪杆子的韩天顺，初到地方工作，分外的觉着吃力。后帮子沽发放贷粮一百多户，他亲自检查了七十三户。从摸索中，使他感觉到有些把握。种麦时，群众有过正月初十才种的习惯，怎样打破旧习惯，实现早种呢？他天天下洼看地，那一片干了，有多大面积可以种，他心里有了数，问村干：“咱村的麦子能种了么？”村干说：“非过了初十种不了。”小韩将地里情况讲清楚，说服了村干部，提早展开了种麦。为解决种麦的人畜力不足，小韩亲自帮助朱子有组织起一个互助组，以此为典型推广到三十三个组。后帮子沽不会治刀鱼，他到朱口庄学了回来教给群众，过年时领导群众不停生产。在短短的日子里他已能这样熟练的工作了。邳守玉负责三区大李庄的工作，当发现村东南三百五十多亩的一片积水洼，能泄水种麦时，他在事先调查清楚是那些人的地，就着手组织有地的四十多户去挖沟。初春的积水里，残留着冰块，人们犹疑着不下水，老邳的泄水心急，脱了衣裳跳下水去，村长吴桂荣为这种精神感动了，跟着下水，接着群众也都下了水，半天开了深宽各二尺半、近三十丈长的两道大沟。他曾亲自帮助群众拉耠子种麦，影响群众拉耠子，解决了缺乏畜力的困难。赵耀先是水乡人有生产经验，他具体的教给曹家沽、杜台子等村插稻秧、养高粮苗，为不误群众生产，到网班去时，一面治鱼，一面给群众讲生产。这些救灾模范们到了那村那户都如家人，当赵耀先同志调工作时，半截沽全村的男女老小都来送行，船走出半里多地，群众还站在村头招手。
