　　On "Standard Rice"

    The original title of this article was "The Scientific Basis of 'Standard Rice' and 'Standard Flour.'" Due to the limited space in this publication, we are publishing the "Standard Rice" portion today and will publish the "Standard Flour" portion tomorrow.

    A few days ago, the People's Daily published on its front page the Government Administration Council's 25th Government Affairs Conference's decision on "Changing Grain Processing Standards, Establishing the Use of 92 Rice and 81 Flour." This is a significant matter.

    "According to rough calculations, if all regions and cities across the country uniformly cease producing refined white rice and top-grade flour, and everyone consumes '92 Rice' and '81 Flour,' then the country can save at least 800 million catties of grain annually." If each person consumes one catty of grain per day, then 800 million catties of grain can feed at least 2 million people.

    Here, I would like to briefly introduce the nutritional value of "92 Rice" and "81 Flour" from the perspective of food chemistry and nutritional science.

    Let's start with "92 Rice."

    As we know, a grain of rice (i.e., paddy) has a hull on its outermost layer. After the hull is removed, what remains is a brown grain called "whole rice," which is the roughest form of rice. This top-grade brown rice can be further divided into four parts in terms of its structure. The outermost layer of "whole rice" is called the "bran" (or "rice husk"), and the next layer is called the "aleurone layer" (or "rice germ layer"); these two layers are the most abundant in protein and minerals. However, because the "bran" has a high fiber content, its texture is relatively coarse; the "aleurone layer" has less fiber, so its texture is finer. The part further inside is called the "rice kernel." This is where the rice grain stores starch. Additionally, at one corner of the "whole rice," there is a part called the "rice embryo" (or "germ"), which is where the rice grain sprouts and roots. This small area also contains the most fat, minerals, and vitamins B1, B2, and nicotinic acid in the entire grain. Usually, rice that has been milled by machines has had the "rice membrane" and "rice embryo" partially or entirely ground off. Especially the refined white rice, processed two or even three times, favored by urban residents, has had the innermost "aleurone layer" completely ground off. After the rice has been repeatedly milled and processed, the "bran" and "rice embryo" are completely removed. Therefore, the severity of nutritional loss during the processing from "whole rice" to "brown rice" to "top-grade white rice" cannot be underestimated. A rough estimate shows that nearly 80% of the fat, over 20% of the protein, nearly 10% of the minerals, and all of the vitamin B1 are lost. These are staggering figures! If rice is milled manually once, without any special processing, the resulting rice will only have the outer "rice membrane" removed, and the nutritional loss will be much less. The "92 Rice" we are now prescribing refers to "all brown rice that is only allowed to be milled once, ensuring that at least 92 catties of edible rice are produced from every 100 catties of brown rice." This type of edible rice contains nutrients that are almost close to the brown rice mentioned here. To make it easier for us to understand, please compare the materials in the first table.

    Table 1: Comparison of Nutrients in "Rice Bran," "Brown Rice," and "Top-Grade White Rice"
                  (Content per 100 grams)
          Rice Bran           Brown Rice           Top-Grade White Rice        Nutrient Loss (Brown Rice → White Rice)
    Water      10.4%              12.30%              12.30%
    Protein    13.8%              9.22%               7.30%               21%
    Fat      17.9%              2.44%               0.50%               80%
    Minerals    10.0%              1.37%               0.70%               49%
    Carbohydrates    41.4%              74.67%              79.20%
    Fiber        6.6%              0.52%               0.18%
    Vitamin B1  560-760 (IU)         20-90 (IU)                0 (IU)             100

    From the figures in this table, we can more clearly understand that the grain processing standards that everyone was accustomed to in the past only cared about the whiteness and appearance of the rice, but did not know (or underestimated) that this excessive milling of the rice removed the originally rich nutrients in the rice, which are also the nutrients urgently needed by our bodies. These nutrients were repeatedly milled away and discarded completely. It is truly a case of "discarding the essence and leaving the dregs." People in the south who love to eat white rice often suffer from a disease called "beriberi," which is caused by the lack of vitamin B1 in white rice.

### 谈“标准米”

　　谈“标准米”
    杨胜
    本篇原题“‘标准米’和‘标准面’的科学基础”，因本刊篇幅有限，今天先发表‘标准米’部分，明天再发表‘标准面’部分。
                 编者
    前几天，人民日报第一版发表了政务院第二十五次政务会议关于“改变粮食加工标准，制用九二米，八一面”的规定。这是一件大事情。
    “据约略的计算，如果全国各地方各城市一律不再制精白米和头等面粉，人人都吃‘九二米’和‘八一面’，则全国全年至少可以节省粮食八亿市斤。”假若每人每天吃一市斤粮食，那么八亿市斤粮食至少可以养活二百万人民。
    这里，我愿意从食品化学和营养科学的分析中来扼要介绍“九二米”和“八一面”的营养价值。
    先谈“九二米”吧。
    我们知道，一粒谷子（即稻种），就它的构造来说，包在它最外面的是一层谷壳。谷子去壳以后，剩下一粒褐色的种实，叫“全米”，这便是最糙的米。这粒头等糙米，详细的来讲，构造上还可以分为四部分。“全米”最外的一层膜，叫“糠皮”（或叫“谷皮”），其次的一层膜，叫“胶层”（或叫“谷膜”）；这二层都是最富含蛋白质和无机盐的部分。不过，因为“糠皮”的纤维含量高，所以质地就比较粗，“胶层”含纤维量较比少，质地也就比较细。再往里去的部分，叫“米仁”。这是稻种积贮淀粉的地方。另外在“全米”一端角上，有一个部分叫“米胚”（或叫“谷胚”）的，这是稻种发芽生根的地方。这一小块地方，也是整个米粒含脂肪，无机盐和维生素乙１，乙２，和烟碱酸最多的所在。通常经机器碾磨过的米，“米膜”和“米胚”已部分的或全部的被磨去。特别是城市里居民喜吃的二机以至三机的精白米，那是将米粒最内一层的“胶层”也全被磨去了的。米经过这么一再碾捣加工处理以后，“糠皮”和“米胚”全被磨脱，所以，从“全米”到“糙米”再到“头等白米”，这么一个加工过程中，在营养素的损失上来讲，其严重的程度是不能小视的。约略计算一下，差不多要损失掉百分之八十的脂肪，百分之二十以上的蛋白质，将近百分之十的无机盐，还有全部的维生素乙１。这是何等惊人的数字！如果，用人力碾捣一次的米，不加任何特别的加工，则所制得的米，是仅将外层的“米膜”脱去，营养素的损失就比较要少得多了。现在我们所规定的“九二米”是指“对所有的糙米都只许碾一道，要保证每一百斤糙米至少出九十二斤食米。”这种食米，它所含有的营养素差不多接近这里所提到的糙米。为了使我们更容易了解起见，请比较一下第一表里的材料吧。
    第一表：“米糠”，“糙米”和“头等白米”中营养素的比较
                  （每一百公分中的含量）
          米糠           糙米           头等白米        营养素的损失（糙米→白米）水分      １０．４％    １２．３０％    １２．３０％蛋白质    １３．８％      ９．２２％      ７．３０％    ２１％脂肪      １７．９％      ２．４４％      ０．５０％    ８０％无机盐    １０．０％      １．３７％      ０．７０％    ４９％醣类      ４１．４％    ７４．６７％    ７９．２０％纤维        ６．６％      ０．５２％      ０．１８％维生素乙１  ５６０—７６０  ２０—９０            ０    １００（国际单位）
    从这表的数字上，我们可以更清楚的知道，过去大家所习惯的粮食加工标准，只顾到米的白净美观，却不知道（或者是轻视了）这种过分把米碾得白净以后，米里原来含有很丰富的营养素，同时也就是我们身体所迫切需要的养料，竟被一再碾磨而弃之尽尽。真是所谓“弃其精华，留下糟粕”，在爱吃白米的南方人中，就常生一种叫“脚气病”的，就是因为白米中缺少了维生素乙１的缘故。
