　　Central People's Government News Administration
    Convenes National News Work Conference

    (Xinhua News Agency, 22nd) The Central People's Government News Administration convened the National News Work Conference from March 29th to April 16th. This conference discussed the main situation and problems of the current national news work. Important issues discussed at the news work conference included improving newspaper work, unifying the organization and work of the Xinhua News Agency, and establishing a national radio network. The News Administration has made decisions on these issues based on the results of the conference discussions.

    Improving newspaper work and strengthening ties with the masses.

    The conference believed that the central issue in improving newspaper work is to strengthen the connection between newspapers and the people. According to the conference's statistics, there are 253 newspapers nationwide, including 175 dailies, with a total circulation of 2.45 million copies. Although this number is small, the number of readers per newspaper and the importance the people attach to newspapers are far beyond comparison with old newspapers. The number of worker and farmer subscribers has increased significantly. For example, worker subscribers account for 47 percent of the Shanghai Liberation Daily, and farmer subscribers account for 28.6 percent of the Xinxiang Pingyuan Daily. Newspapers have thousands or even tens of thousands of correspondents. The Baoding Hebei Daily in the old liberated area has 16,000 correspondents, and the Zhejiang Daily in the new liberated area has 4,300 correspondents. A large number of readers write letters to newspapers or come directly to the newspaper office. The Shenyang Northeast Daily received 16,000 letters in February. In the first half of March, 513 readers came to the Pingyuan Daily to ask questions. These facts show that the people love their newspapers. The weakness of most newspapers now is that they cannot yet well adapt to the needs of the masses for newspapers. Many newspapers have not paid attention to reporting and discussing the work and life of the working people, as well as the situation and problems in economic construction, and have devoted a large amount of space to things that lack important relevance to the local people's lives. Many newspapers have not taken a serious attitude towards the work of correspondents and readers' letters. Newspapers lack constant attention and full responsibility for criticism and self-criticism, and have not made effective efforts to correct the phenomenon of many criticized people ignoring criticism and suppressing criticism. In response to these phenomena, the News Administration, in its "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work," requires national newspapers to devote primary space to the people's productive labor and economic construction work, to regard the development of criticism and self-criticism, the establishment and leadership of correspondent networks and reading groups, and the responsible answering of readers' letters as important political tasks, and requires that the organizational form and working methods of newspaper editorial departments be appropriately reorganized to adapt to the above tasks.

    Unifying the organization and work of Xinhua News Agency.

    The News Work Conference believed that it is necessary to unify the organization and work of the Xinhua News Agency. The Xinhua News Agency currently broadcasts approximately 20,000 to 24,000 words of news copy every day, supplying it to newspapers across the country and many foreign newspapers. The strength on which it relies to undertake this task includes, in addition to the Xinhua News Agency headquarters, twelve general branch offices, under which are fifty-seven branch offices, and another eight directly affiliated branch offices at home and abroad. Most of these general and branch offices undertake local tasks, and many branch offices are even affiliated with local newspapers. This decentralized situation was formed by the war and was once suitable for the situation and requirements of the long-term war, but it is not suitable for today's unified national situation and the requirements of a unified national news agency. The News Administration has made a decision based on the opinions of the News Work Conference to unify the organization and work of the general and branch offices of the Xinhua News Agency throughout the country under the management of the Xinhua News Agency, and no longer publish news and commentaries to the localities. According to the decision, the Xinhua News Agency will only establish six local general branch offices in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China. The original general branch office of the troops will remain as it is for the time being except for the Third Field Army general branch office. The Xinhua News Agency organizations of the remaining field armies and military regions will be merged with the local general branch offices, and the local general branch offices will be responsible for continuing to report on the troops.

    Ensuring that the people's broadcasting cause is truly built on the foundation of the masses.

    The News Work Conference believes that a radio network should be established across the country to enable the people's broadcasting cause to play its due role in propaganda and education on a solid mass foundation. According to the conference's statistics, there are currently 83 radio stations nationwide, with the Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station having the largest output power, exceeding half of the total of all stations in the country. The Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station currently broadcasts for fifteen and a half hours a day. In addition to Beijing dialect, it also has programs in Amoy dialect, Chaozhou dialect, Cantonese, Hakka dialect, and English, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese, and Siamese. It has also specially added programs in Mongolian, Tibetan, and Korean. The problem that the people's broadcasting cause must currently solve is the effective use of radios. There are approximately more than one million radios nationwide, more than half of which are in Northeast China and Shanghai. Many places do not have radios, or although they do, they are not used effectively. The News Work Conference believes that every county government and every political organ of the troops should set up radio operators responsible for transcribing the main points of the news, government decrees, and other important content broadcast every day, and printing and posting them. In addition, the conference requires that all organs, organizations, factories, and schools also consider setting up radio operators, and requires activists among the audience to voluntarily apply to be radio operators in order to establish regular contact with radio stations and become a bridge for radio stations to connect with the people.

    In addition to the two items regarding improving newspaper work and establishing a radio network, which have been decided by the News Administration and submitted to the 29th meeting of the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation, the various issues discussed at the News Work Conference, regarding the unification of Xinhua News Agency and other issues, have also been decided by the Administration and will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and then notified to the whole country for implementation.

　　中央人民政府新闻总署
    召集全国新闻工作会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府新闻总署在三月二十九日至四月十六日曾召集全国新闻工作会议，这个会议曾就目前全国新闻工作的主要情况和问题加以讨论。新闻工作会议讨论的重要问题，包括改进报纸工作，统一新华通讯社的组织和工作，建立全国广播收音网等项，这些问题已由新闻总署根据会议讨论的结果作出决定。
    改进报纸工作，加强与群众的联系。
    这次会议认为改进报纸工作的中心问题是加强报纸与人民群众的联系。根据会议的统计，全国报纸共有二百五十三种，内日报一百七十五种，发行总份数二百四十五万份。这个数字虽然是小的，但是每一份报纸的读者人数和人民群众对报纸的重视程度却远非旧日的报纸所能比较。工人农民的订户有了显著的增加，例如上海解放日报职工订户占百分之四十七，新乡平原日报农民订户占百分之二十八点六。报纸有了成千甚至成万的通讯员。老区的保定河北日报有通讯员一万六千人，新区的浙江日报也有通讯员四千三百人。有大量的读者向报纸写信或直接到报社来。沈阳东北日报二月份接到来信一万六千件。平原日报三月上半月有五百十三个读者来到报社问事。这些事实说明人民群众是热爱自己的报纸的。现在多数报纸的弱点，是还不能很好地适应群众对于报纸的需要。许多报纸对于劳动人民的工作和生活以及经济建设中的情况和问题没有能注意报道和讨论，而把大量的篇幅登载与地方人民生活缺乏重要关系的事情。许多报纸对于通讯员的工作和读者来信的工作没有采取郑重的态度。报纸对于批评和自我批评缺乏经常的注意和充分的责任心，对于许多被批评者忽视批评和压制批评的现象没有努力进行有效的纠正。针对这些现象，新闻总署在《关于改进报纸工作的决定》中要求全国报纸把首要的篇幅用于人民的生产劳动和经济建设工作，要求全国报纸把展开批评和自我批评、建立和领导通讯员网和读报组的工作、以及负责地答复读者来信，当作重要的政治任务，并要求报纸编辑部门的组织形式和工作方法适应上述任务作适当的改组。
    统一新华社的组织和工作。
    新闻工作会议认为必须统一新华通讯社的组织和工作。新华通讯社现在每日播发通讯稿约二万至二万四千字，供应全国各报和许多外国报纸。担负这个任务所依靠的力量，除新华社总社外，还有十二个总分社，下辖五十七个分社，另在国内外有八个直属分社。这些总分社和分社中的多数，都担负着地方的任务，有不少分社甚至附属于地方的报社。这种分散的状况是战争所形成的，曾经适合于长期战争中的情况和要求，但是不能适合于今天全国统一的情况和统一的国家通讯社的要求。新闻总署已根据新闻工作会议的意见作出决定，将全国新华社的总分社和分社的组织和工作都统一归新华社管理，不再向地方发表消息和评论。按照决定，新华社将只在华北、东北、华东、中南、西南、西北设六个地方总分社，原有部队总分社除第三野战军总分社暂维原状外，其余各野战军和军区的新华社组织均将与地方总分社合并，而由地方总分社负责继续进行对部队的报道。
    使人民广播事业确实建立在群众基础上。
    新闻工作会议认为，应在全国建立广播收音网，以便使人民广播事业在确实的群众基础上发挥应有的宣传教育作用。根据会议的统计，全国现有广播电台八十三座，以北京中央人民广播电台输出电力最大，超过全国各台总和之半。北京中央人民广播电台现每日播音十五小时半，除北京话外，并有厦门话、潮州话、广州话、客家话和英语、日语、越南语、印尼语、缅甸语、暹罗语的节目，并特增设蒙语、藏语和朝鲜语的节目。人民广播事业目前所必须解决的问题是收音机的有效使用。全国约有一百万部以上的收音机，其过半数是在东北和上海，许多地方没有收音机，或虽有而未加以有效的使用。新闻工作会议认为，应在全国每个县政府、每个部队的政治机关都设置收音员，负责抄收每天所广播的新闻、政令和其他重要内容的要点，加以印发和张贴。此外，会议要求各机关、团体、工厂、学校也酌量设置收音员、并要求听众中的积极分子自动声请为收音员，以便与广播电台取得经常的联系，成为广播电台联系人民群众的桥梁。
    新闻工作会议所讨论的各项问题，除关于改进报纸工作和建立广播收音网的两项已由新闻总署作出决定并提请政务院二十九次会议批准公布外，关于统一新华社问题和其他问题，也已由该署作出决定并将呈准政务院后通告全国予以实施。
