Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Finance and Economics Committee of the Central People's Government's Executive Yuan issued a directive last month regarding a unified national census of all state-owned, joint state-private, and industrial production cooperative industrial and mining enterprises. The decision pointed out: This unified national census is to specifically understand the basic situation of industrial and mining enterprises across the country, as a basis for restoring and developing industrial and mining production. This census is a major event for the financial and economic departments in 1950. If this work can be done well, it will be of great help to the future implementation of a planned economy. The decision requires the heads of all ministries, banks, offices, and bureaus under the Central Finance and Economics Committee, the financial and economic committees of all major administrative regions, the people's governments at all levels of provinces, cities, special districts, counties, and districts, and the leading organs of all industrial and mining enterprises and industrial production cooperatives to designate specific personnel to conduct surveys and statistics, and to provide convenience and assistance to survey and statistical personnel at all levels. The heads of governments at all levels, and the persons in charge of all industrial and mining enterprises and industrial production cooperatives, after receiving the survey forms and instructions, should immediately consult with relevant personnel to study the contents of the forms in detail. After correctly understanding the forms, they should carefully arrange the survey work and urge the responsible personnel to fill them out truthfully. If there are special difficulties and some items cannot be filled out, they should explain the situation to the higher-level authorities. The central financial and economic ministries, banks, offices, and bureaus, and the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions should be responsible for guiding the filling of forms by their subordinate institutions, and promptly prepare the comprehensive statistical work that they should do. All levels of institutions should complete their respective tasks in a timely manner, and extensions should not be granted without approval. All persons in charge of industrial and mining enterprises and industrial production cooperatives should complete the filling of the forms between April and August 1, 1950, and submit them to the designated higher-level institutions. The central financial and economic ministries, banks, offices, and bureaus, and the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions should, before July to September 1, compile comprehensive statistical reports of their respective industrial and mining enterprises and cooperatives in accordance with the prescribed format, and submit them to the Central Finance and Economics Committee. The timing for the completion of the survey forms in Southwest China, Guangxi, and Xinjiang will be determined by the respective regional and provincial financial and economic committees. All industrial and mining enterprises affiliated with the central ministries, banks, offices, and bureaus, local government agencies at all levels, and cooperatives, regardless of whether they have power equipment or their size, should be investigated.
