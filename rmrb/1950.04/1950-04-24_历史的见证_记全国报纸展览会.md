A Witness to History
On the National Newspaper Exhibition

	A witness to history is here. The history of the Chinese people's heroic struggles, advancing wave upon wave until complete victory over fifty years, is recorded in this long array of thousands of newspapers of all kinds spread out before us. This is also the history of the growth and development of the people's newspapers themselves, and the history of the arduous struggle of countless news workers loyal to the people's cause over the decades.

(I) From the Xinhai Revolution to the May Fourth Movement

	In the first part of the exhibition, which displays newspapers from 1896 through the Xinhai Revolution (1911) to the May Fourth Movement (1919), one can see the *Shiwu Bao* founded by Liang Qichao in Shanghai, which advocated reform; and various *Shi Bao* that promoted national independence and hailed the rise of the Republic of China around the time of the Xinhai Revolution. One can also see the *Minquan Bao* and *Minzhu Bao*, which denounced Yuan Shikai as a traitor to the country and the people after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. The two thick volumes of bound *New Youth* are further evidence of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal patriotic democratic movement carried out by the Chinese people around the May Fourth Movement.

(II) A Spark – *The Communist Monthly*

	A thin booklet illuminated people's eyes. This is *The Communist Monthly*, published in 1921. Just as the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party refreshed the face of the Chinese revolution, the publication of this booklet promoting Marxism-Leninism also pointed out a brand-new path for the future newspapers of the Chinese people – newspapers consciously serving the political struggle, playing the role of collective propagandists and collective organizers. This idea is like a red thread running through all the newspapers published in the Soviet era and the liberated areas up to 1949.

(III) A Combat Command Post – From *Red China* to *Liberation Daily*

	*Red China*, published in Jiangxi in 1932, is the earliest seen organ of the CCP Central Committee. For a full decade – from 1921 to 1931 – the newspaper record is blank. Of course, this blank period in newspapers does not equate to a blank period in history. It was precisely in these ten years that the Chinese people began to engage in earth-shattering undertakings – millions of workers and peasants organized themselves and carried out revolutionary struggles against imperialism, feudal landlords, and warlord bureaucrats, writing immortal epics in history such as the February 7th Strike, the May 30th Movement, and the Northern Expedition. However, the Great Revolution was ultimately betrayed by Chiang Kai-shek, the representative of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. It is conceivable that when the revolution suffered serious blows, and the Chinese Communist Party, leading the people's revolution, had to go underground and turn to the countryside to regroup and deploy struggles, some newspapers and other propaganda materials were difficult to preserve. The publication of *Red China*, the initial organ of the Chinese Communist Party, precisely indicated the rise of the people's power after the Great Revolution was struck down. Here, the indomitable fighting will of millions of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters in the Central Soviet Area, which was attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction with a mobilized army of millions for three years, is fully and truthfully reflected. From here, the people can also see: the Party newspaper, from its very beginning, showed the characteristics of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses.

	The Red Army shattered the five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and began the unprecedented heroic 25,000-li Long March. After arriving in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, we saw the *New China Daily*, the central organ of the Soviet government, with "unity for resistance against Japan" becoming the overriding central content of this newspaper. As a promoter and organizer of unity for resistance against Japan, this newspaper constantly and correctly propagated the achievements of the nationwide military and civilians in resisting Japan to the world and to all of China (if it could break through the Kuomintang blockade), and systematically introduced the construction of the political, economic, military, cultural, and educational undertakings of the anti-Japanese base areas. The role of the newspaper also developed in many directions, such as guiding work and exchanging experiences. After it was renamed *Liberation Daily* in May 1941, these characteristics were further developed.

(IV) Growing in Struggle

	In the cruel struggle environment behind enemy lines, hundreds of local and military newspapers were produced. Casually flipping through the newspapers of 1944, we can see: "Bitter Battle of 583 Days in Ding Tang Da Yang Town," "Zhao Jia Yu Cooperative Prepares for Autumn Harvest in a Combat Posture," "Li Lai Cheng's New-Style Democratic Family," "How Zhang Rui Cooperative is Run," "How to Get Rid of Cabbage Worms and How to Grow Good Cabbage," etc. The things reported here are closely connected to the people's struggle and production. Because of this, these newspapers grew and developed in the cruel combat environment and under extremely difficult publication conditions.

	History continues to move forward. The headline news of the *Northeast Daily*, which was first published on November 1, 1945, was the news that Chairman Mao had flown back to Yan'an after signing the Double Tenth Agreement. This was news that the entire Chinese people cheered for at the time because it brought the Chinese people hope for building a peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. However, on the *People's Daily* of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, published on May 15, 1946, was prominently printed the crime record of the "Kuomintang's plotting of a full-scale civil war" and "deliberately releasing water to flood millions of people in our liberated areas."

	After this came three years of hard struggle for the Chinese people, and also three years in which the Chinese revolution steadily gained victory. The newspapers in the liberated areas became more and more numerous – there were dozens or hundreds of kinds such as *Harbin Daily*, *New Shijiazhuang Daily*, *Chahar Daily*, *Bohai Daily*, etc. And all of these newspapers, without exception, implemented the policy of combining with practice and combining with the masses. One of the characteristics was that all these newspapers in different regions each possessed a vast communication network, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasting networks spread throughout the villages, workshops, organs, troops, and schools in their respective regions. A news item from the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily's communication work conference showed that the newspaper had 183 sound village reading groups and 630 correspondents in one district of six counties. The *People's Daily* of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu had more than 3,000 correspondents. Through so many correspondents, a strong bond was made between the newspaper and the masses.

	In addition, the *Xinhua Daily* North China Edition's three-review news style and the *JinSui Daily*'s self-criticism against "empty talk" were the second characteristics of these newspapers. The *Liberation Daily* consecutively published editorials against purely technical viewpoints in news, against "empty talk," and against stale and harmful writing styles. Such serious self-criticism prepared favorable conditions for the subsequent victorious leap forward of the people's news undertaking throughout the country.

(V) Several Photos – A microcosm of the arduous work of news workers in the liberated areas

	Several work photos of comrades from the Jin-Cha-Ji Pictorial Society attracted great attention. The comrades of the Pictorial Society transferred during the anti-mopping-up operations, taking turns to stand guard and monitor the enemy; when the situation was more tense, they put the machines into the caves; the third photo was of them practicing target shooting; the fourth was of them helping the villagers harvest crops; the fifth was of the Pictorial Society comrades washing photos with well water in the open air in the severe winter, without perfect studios and scientific equipment in the harsh operating environment; the last photo was a eulogy from the Pictorial Society comrades commemorating several comrades who sacrificed in the anti-mopping-up campaign in 1943, with the words: "We will advance along your bloody footprints!" These photos vividly illustrate the arduous work of comrades engaged in pictorials and other publications in the liberated areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

(VI) The Second Battlefield

	The third part of the exhibition is the second battlefield of the people's news undertaking, the progressive newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas such as *Wenhui Bao*, *United Evening News*, *Times Daily*, *Student News*, etc. Filling the pages of these newspapers are the sounds of the people's blood and tears: being out of school, being unemployed, rice grabbing, strikes, school strikes, marches, demonstrations, imprisonment, conscription and anti-conscription... These are the voices of the people shouted out by progressive news workers in the Kuomintang areas under the threat of guns, prisons, live burials, beatings, and murders. These progressive news workers, who persisted in the enemy-controlled areas, exposed the crimes and shameless deception and conspiracies of the enemy's rule, and encouraged and consolidated the determination and confidence of the people in the enemy-controlled areas to carry out patriotic and democratic movements. In the end, the persecution they and the newspapers suffered, such as exile, arrest, beatings, murder, and closure, as well as the fact that the rulers completely shot down freedom of speech, further educated the people in the reactionary-controlled areas of their determination to struggle.

(VII) Following the People's Liberation Army Forward!

	In the victorious year of 1949, the heroic People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the support of the people of the whole country, liberated the entire mainland of China. When liberating each major city, news workers always followed the troops into the city first. In the battle to liberate the Great Southwest, when the army marched rapidly to pursue and annihilate the remnants of the White bandits at a speed of 200 li day and night, braving hot rain and treading through muddy water, news workers also marched arduously with the troops in order to publish newspapers in a timely manner.

(VIII) Red Flags are Planted All Over the Motherland

	Now, the Chinese people's news undertaking has developed and grown rapidly. The hundreds of newspapers of October 1st (including overseas Chinese newspapers from Southeast Asia, San Francisco, Japan, and Korea) displayed before us all printed the victorious news of the founding of the country and the huge photos of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao in bright red characters. On a large map of the People's Republic of China, hundreds of red flags mark the locations of people's newspapers of various names. In the remote city of Kashgar in Xinjiang, a red flag with the words "Kashgar Daily" is flying; four red flags with the words "Xinjiang Daily" in Chinese, Mongolian, Uyghur, and Russian are planted in Yili, the capital of Xinjiang Province; in the southwest corner of the map, you can see the red flags of the *Qinghai Daily* and the *Xikang Daily*; in the north, the flag of the *New Heihe Daily* is high above in Aigun, the northernmost part of the country. The people's news undertaking presents infinitely bright and promising prospects. (Jin Feng)

　　历史的见证
    记全国报纸展览会
    历史的见证在这里。五十年来，中国人民英勇斗争，前仆后继以至完全胜利的历史的见证，记载在这一长列摊开着的各式各样的几千份报纸里。这也就是人民报纸本身成长和发展的历史，是无数忠于人民事业的新闻工作者几十年来艰苦奋斗的历史。
  （一）从辛亥革命到五四运动
    在这里陈列着的第一部分从一八九六年经过辛亥革命（一九一一年）到五四运动（一九一九年）的报纸里，可以看到有梁启超在上海创办的鼓吹维新变法的时务报，辛亥革命前后宣传民族独立、欢呼民国兴起的多种时报；也可以看到在辛亥革命失败以后，痛斥袁世凯为国贼民贼的民权报、民主报等等。两厚卷新青年的合订本，更是中国人民在五四前后进行反帝反封建的爱国民主运动的见证。
  （二）一颗火星——共产党月刊
    一本薄薄的小册子照亮了人们的眼睛，这是在一九二一年出版的共产党月刊。正如中国共产党的产生刷新了中国革命的面目一样，这本宣传马列主义的小册子的出版，也为中国人民今后的报纸指出一条崭新的道路——报纸自觉地服务于政治斗争，发挥集体的宣传者与集体的组织者的作用。这思想仿佛一条红线，贯穿在所有从苏维埃时期到一九四九年的解放区出版的报纸里。
  （三）战斗司令台——从红色中华到解放日报
    一九三二年在江西出版的红色中华是最先看到的中共中央的机关报。整整十年——一九二一到一九三一年中，报纸的纪录是空白的。当然，这一段报纸的空白并不等于历史的空白。正就是这十年，中国人民开始干着惊天动地的大事业——千百万工人农民组织起来，向着帝国主义、封建地主和军阀官僚进行革命斗争，在历史上写下了像二七运动、五卅运动以及北伐大革命这些不朽的史诗。但是，大革命终于被大地主大资产阶级的代表蒋介石所出卖。可以想得到，当革命遭受到严重的打击，领导人民革命的中国共产党不得不转入地下，转向农村重新积聚力量布置斗争的时候，一些报纸和其他宣传品是难得保留下来的。中国共产党最初的机关报，红色中华的出版，正表明着人民力量在大革命受打击之后的抬头。在这里充分地真实地反映了当时被蒋介石反动派动员了百万大军，进攻了三年之久的中央苏区千百万优秀的中华儿女不屈不挠的战斗意志。从这里人民也可以看到：党报，在它一开始的时候就表现了联系实际，联系群众的特点。
    红军粉碎了五次“围剿”，开始了史无前例的英勇的二万五千里长征。到达陕甘宁边区以后，我们看到作为苏维埃中央机关报的新中华报，“团结抗日”成为这张报纸的压倒一切的中心内容。作为团结抗日的宣传者也是组织者的这张报纸，并不断地向全世界、全中国（如果能冲破国民党封锁线的话）正确地宣传着全国军民的抗战业绩，系统地介绍着抗战根据地的政治、经济、军事、文化、教育的建设事业。报纸的作用，并向着指导工作、交流经验等多方面发展开去。一九四一年五月改版为解放日报，这些特点更见发扬着。
  （四）在斗争中成长
    在敌后残酷的斗争环境中，产生了百数十种地方和部队的报纸。随手一翻一九四四年的报纸，我们可以看到：“苦战五百八十三天的定唐大洋镇”，“赵家峪合作社以战斗姿态准备秋收”，“李来成新式民主家庭”，“张瑞合作社是怎样办起来的”，“怎样拿白菜虫和怎样种好白菜”等等，这里所报导的事情，正和人民的战斗和生产血肉相连，也因为如此，这些报纸才在残酷的战斗环境中，出版条件极其困难的情况下成长与发展起来。
    历史在继续行进。一九四五年十一月一日创刊的东北日报，头条新闻就是毛主席签订了双十协定之后飞返延安的消息。这是当时全中国人民一致为之欢呼的消息，因为这消息为中国人民带来了建立一个和平、统一、富强的新中国的希望。但是，一九四六年五月十五日出版的晋冀鲁豫边区的人民日报上，就赫然登载了“国民党策动全面内战”，“蓄意放水淹我解放区数百万人民”的罪行记录。
    这以后，是中国人民苦战的三年，也是中国革命步步获得胜利的三年。解放区的报纸愈来愈多了——有哈尔滨日报、新石门报、察哈尔日报、渤海日报等等数十百种。而这些报纸，也都无例外地执行着与实际结合与群众结合的方针。特征之一是所有这些不同地区的报纸，都各各拥有一套遍布在该地区的乡村、作坊、机关、部队、学校的广大通讯网、读报小组、黑板报和屋顶广播网。晋察冀日报的一则通讯工作会议新闻，表明了该报在六个县的一个分区中，就拥有一百八十三个健全的村读报组和六百三十个通讯员。晋冀鲁豫的人民日报，则拥有三千多通讯员。通过如此众多的通讯员，使报纸与群众中间，有了韧强的连系纽带。
    此外，新华日报华北版的三审新闻八股，晋绥日报的反对“客里空”的自我批评，解放日报连发反对新闻上的单纯技术观点、反对“客里空”、反对陈腐有害的文风的社论，这是报纸的第二个特点。这样严肃的自我批评，为此后人民新闻事业在全国范围内胜利跃进准备了有利的条件。
  （五）几张照片——解放区新闻工作者艰苦工作的缩影
    几张晋察冀画报社同志的工作照片，吸引了人们巨大的注意。画报社同志在反扫荡中转战，轮流放着哨，监视敌人；情况再紧张一些，他们就把机器放进地洞里去；第三张是他们在练习打靶；第四张是帮助老乡收庄稼；第五张是在艰苦的作战环境中没有完美的工作室和科学设备的情况下，画报社同志在严冬室外，用井水冲洗照片；最后一张是画报社同志纪念在一九四三年反扫荡中牺牲的几位同志的挽联，上面写着：“我们将踏着你们的血迹前进”！这些照片，极为生动地说明了解放区从事画刊和其他出版工作的同志们在抗日战争中艰苦的工作情形。
  （六）第二战场
    陈列着的第三部分是人民新闻事业的第二战场，国民党统治区的进步报纸如文汇报、联合晚报、时代日报、学生报等。充满在这些报纸的篇幅中的是失学、失业、抢米、罢工、罢课、游行、示威、坐牢、征兵反征兵、……一连串人民的血泪的声音。这是国民党区进步的新闻工作者，在手枪、牢狱、活埋、殴杀的威胁下所喊出的人民的声音。这些坚持在敌人统治区的进步的新闻工作者，揭发了敌人统治的罪恶和无耻的欺骗阴谋，鼓舞和巩固了敌人统治区人民进行爱国民主运动的决心和信心。到了最后他们以及报纸所遭受的流亡、被捕、殴杀、封闭等等迫害以及言论自由完全被统治者枪毙了的事实，也进一步教育了反动统治区人民的斗争决心。
  （七）跟着解放军前进！
    一九四九年胜利年中，英勇的人民解放军在毛主席和朱总司令的领导和全国人民的支援下，解放了中国全部大陆。在解放每一大城市的时候，新闻工作者总是跟随部队最先进城。在解放大西南的战役中，当军队以日夜二百里的速度，冒热雨踏泥水急行军追歼白匪残军时，新闻工作者为了及时出报，也和部队一起艰苦行军。
  （八）红旗遍插在祖国的大地上
    现在，中国人民新闻事业已飞速地发展壮大起来了。眼前摆着的几百份十月一日的报纸（包括南洋、旧金山、日本、朝鲜的侨民报纸），都以鲜红的字印出了胜利的开国消息和中国人民领袖毛主席的巨幅照片。在一张中华人民共和国的大地图上，几百面的红旗标志着各种名称的人民报纸的位置上。在辽远的新疆喀什城有一面写着喀什日报的红旗在飘扬着，四面写着中蒙维哈文的新疆日报的红旗插在新疆省会的伊犁；在地图的西南角上可以看到青海日报和西康日报的红旗；北面则有新黑河报的旗帜高高插在最北部国境的瑷珲地方。人民的新闻事业呈现出了无限光明远大的前景。      （金凤）
