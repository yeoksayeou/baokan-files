Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 25th: At the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference, Mayor Chen Yi delivered a report on "Shanghai's Work Tasks." Mayor Chen first provided a summary of Shanghai's specific situation in the recent period. He said: In the four months since the Second People's Representative Conference, Shanghai has experienced a relatively arduous journey. Due to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's promulgation of annual bonus methods for public enterprises in December of last year, the broad masses of Shanghai workers agreed to overcome difficulties and implement the decision of the Second People's Representative Conference regarding labor-management consultation to resolve annual bonuses in private enterprises. Shanghai workers made concessions in this regard, taking the overall situation into consideration, and should be commended. At the same time, the People's Bank provided tremendous assistance in capital turnover, thereby smoothly helping private industry get through the New Year, proving that the government fulfilled its responsibility to care for private industry. The bombing by remnant bandits on February 6 caused significant damage to Shanghai's industry. However, due to the efforts of the People's Government and workers, electricity was quickly restored. The civil air defense organization was well-organized and carried out its work in a planned manner. The East China Military Region adopted extremely effective air defense deployments and quickly eliminated the aerial threat. In February and March, thanks to the efforts of workers, students, women, the business community, and various organs and troops, the promotion of public bonds and tax collection progressed smoothly, completing more than half of the planned targets. The active work of public bond promotion personnel and financial and tax personnel, as well as the patriotic enthusiasm of the business community and citizens in purchasing bonds and paying taxes, should all be commended. In general, under the circumstances of the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits' blockade and bombing sabotage, and in the context of severe disasters in rural areas of East China, Shanghai was able to largely complete public bond and tax revenue targets, stabilize prices, and effectively prevent enemy aerial destruction. This proves the correctness of the leadership of the Central People's Government, and demonstrates that the unity of the government and people from all walks of life is capable of breaking out of the economically difficult environment and opening a path towards improvement. This is an extremely significant achievement. These achievements point to a bright future and declare the failure of the imperialists and Chiang bandits' attempt to destroy Shanghai.

  Price Stability and Coal and Grain Self-Sufficiency Break Shanghai's Abnormal Rules

Mayor Chen then provided a detailed analysis of price stability, current economic difficulties, and the future development trends of Shanghai. He said: We who have lived in Shanghai for many years have historically suffered from inflation and price fluctuations. In the past, Shanghai citizens had to rely on foreign supplies to maintain their coal and grain needs. People engaged in legitimate industry and commerce have historically been controlled by experts who speculated and made huge profits, and many have either been forced to abandon their legitimate businesses and join speculative groups, or have been forced to shut down and go bankrupt. This was the abnormal rule of old Shanghai society under imperialist rule, and it was impossible to change in the past. Now, in Shanghai under the management of New Democracy, regardless of the various unfavorable and difficult conditions that still exist, in just ten months, the old rules have been broken, and coal, grain, and daily necessities can be fully supplied by the country, prices have become stable, and we have escaped from the sea of ​​inflation. Isn't this strange? Isn't this beyond everyone's expectations? Please recall the surge in prices from October to November of last year, which spread from Shanghai to the whole country, and how seriously the broad masses of people suffered from price fluctuations. At that time, people judged the policies and leadership ability of the People's Government by whether prices could be stabilized, and some even absolutely did not believe that the People's Government had the ability to stabilize prices. At the end of November last year, the People's Government made various efforts to stabilize prices, but some people said: "This is not reliable, I still have to take a look!" They predicted that there would definitely be major fluctuations in the red market on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, but the Eight Trigrams calculation was inaccurate. They also predicted that prices would definitely skyrocket in March. They kept chanting in their mouths, sharpening their swords and preparing for a big move in order to reap huge profits. But contrary to their wishes, the Eight Trigrams were inaccurate again. Only then did they begin to doubt themselves and begin to believe that Shanghai was changing. We do not despise these people, but we welcome them to truly gain lessons and new awareness. In order to promote their awareness, we must point out that the main reason why Shanghai's prices can be stabilized and speculative storms can be suppressed is because the policy of the Central People's Government is correct and its leadership is extremely strong. There is no secret to this, mainly relying on levying public grain, rectifying tax revenue, issuing public bonds, and unifying finance and economics, rather than relying on currency issuance. We acknowledge that the People's Government has done a good job in stabilizing prices, and we should acknowledge the correctness of the public grain, public bond, and tax revenue policies, and we should enthusiastically complete various tasks to repay the country, such as public bonds and tax payment. Because the work of the Central People's Government is strictly in accordance with the principle of serving the people, and the focus of its public grain, public bond, and tax revenue policies is to strive to organize and guide the national industry and commerce into a normal path of recovery and development. The Central People's Government has thoroughly unified the national finance and economics, and it has a considerable amount of financial and material resources in its hands, correctly regulating the national market. This effect has only begun to manifest itself, and it will be manifested on a larger scale and to a higher degree in the future. For example, the public bond and tax revenue policies are undoubtedly to concentrate large financial resources in the hands of the Central People's Government, but the People's Government takes from the people and uses it for the people. The People's Government will not waste it, but will ensure that it is used in legitimate ways, especially in all undertakings related to the restoration and development of production. The huge military expenditure is to eliminate the remnant enemies, which is to open the road to economic recovery. There will still be many difficulties in the future, but the prospects for improvement and brightness can already be clearly seen. Shanghai occupies an important position in the country's economic recovery and transformation, and therefore the difficulties it manifests in the transformation process must also be extremely great. We are not afraid of difficulties. Enduring these difficulties and overcoming these difficulties will lead to the arrival of improvement.

  Strive to Overcome Current Difficulties and Strive for Improvement in the Economic Situation

Mayor Chen then said: Once we understand the above trends, the following four questions can be correctly understood. First, we will know that completing the public bond purchase task and completing the tax payment task is appropriate and requires special efforts. Only in this way can we guarantee the military elimination of remnant enemies and the completion of China's great unification; can we more firmly stabilize prices and more reliably create conditions for economic production to recover and develop. Even if it means that Shanghai as a whole, or individuals, have to temporarily endure the pain of reduction and fundraising, this is still necessary. Because only in this way can we gradually get on the path of improvement. There is only this bright road, and we must move forward bravely. Second, we will know that many high-end consumer businesses and many businesses suitable for speculation and harming market normalization will inevitably decline. Only by transforming ourselves and conforming to the interests of the people can we have a future. Therefore, this kind of decline and closure is inevitable and very painful; but don't be afraid, if you are determined to transform, it is the prelude to rebirth and brightness. Third, we will know that many legitimate industries and businesses also have phenomena that cannot be maintained, mainly due to sluggish sales, high costs, lack of raw materials, and improper management, internal corruption without the courage to reform, trapping themselves in a difficult situation. But these are all temporary phenomena. In a favorable overall situation, such as the elimination of remnant enemies, stable prices, progress in rural work, and the gradual adaptation of national supply and demand, the future of legitimate industry and commerce is extremely bright. We should mainly rely on our own efforts to make various internal reforms. As long as we can work hard to maintain the current situation, we can overcome difficulties and usher in great recovery and development. Fourth, we will know that many new enterprises will be generated in Shanghai. For example, public undertakings that are directly related to the lives of the broad masses of people are gradually increasing, and this should be welcomed. The private sector in this type of business should obey the leadership of the public sector and make appropriate adjustments and divisions of labor. The consolidation and development of public enterprises is still beneficial to private enterprises. The report by Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government, published in the Liberation Daily on April 5, pointed out that under the conditions of the great development of public industry and agriculture in the Northeast, taking Shenyang City as an example, the number of private industrialists in the city increased by 23 percent; the number of workers they employed increased by 18 percent. This is the most significant fact, illustrating the correctness of the policy of taking both public and private interests into account. In view of the above four aspects, we should bravely state the difficulties and not hide the difficulties. We can predict that in Shanghai's construction in the future, many temporary shutdowns are unavoidable; temporary unemployment and dropping out of school are also unavoidable. These are all painful phenomena and must be endured. After these pains, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and transition to a good path of recovery and development. The above is my explanation of the development trend of the new Shanghai.

  Finally, Mayor Chen succinctly pointed out that Shanghai's work tasks in the future are: Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, support the front lines, eliminate remnant enemies, and suppress special agents and bandits; call for labor-management unity, strive to maintain industrial production, and reduce the phenomenon of shutdowns; formulate unemployment and dropout relief plans and carry out general refugee relief work; at the same time, strive to complete and exceed the public bond purchase task; ensure the completion of the tax revenue task, and resolutely fight against tax evasion. This is the work that should be done from this conference to the Fourth People's Representative Conference, and it is an urgent combat task.

  Mayor Chen also requested that the delegates to the conference should conduct more research, provide more explanations, and dispel misunderstandings and doubts based on the policies of the Central People's Government and the implementation measures that should be taken in Shanghai, so that everyone can combine the current difficulties with the bright future, and have the confidence to go through the current steps to overcome difficulties in order to strive for the arrival of an improved economic situation.

　　上海市第三次各界人民代表会议上
    陈毅市长报告上海市工作任务
    号召支援前线、劳资团结、救济失业、完成公债、保证税收
    【新华社上海二十五日电】陈毅市长在上海市第三次各界人民代表会议上，作了“上海市工作任务”的报告。陈市长首先就最近期间上海的具体情况，作了概括的说明。他说：从第二次各界代表会议以来的四个月内，上海经历了一段比较艰苦的路程。由于中央人民政府政务院在去年十二月颁布了公营企业的年奖办法，上海广大职工同意为了克服困难，执行了二届各界代表会议关于劳资协商解决私营企业的年奖的决定。上海职工在这方面照顾大局作了让步，是应该表扬的。同时，人民银行作了巨大的资金周转的协助，因而顺利地使私营工业渡过了年关，证明政府是尽了照顾私营工业的责任的。二月六日残匪的轰炸，使上海工业遭受了巨大的损害。但由于人民政府与职工的努力，电力迅速恢复。市民防空组织严密，有计划地进行了工作。华东军区采取了极有力的防空部署，迅速地解除了空中的威胁。二、三月内，由于工人、学生、妇女、工商界及各机关部队的努力，公债推销与税务的进行颇为顺利，完成了预定计划大半以上。推销公债人员、财政税务人员的积极工作，工商界与市民们购债纳税的爱国热忱，都是应该表扬的。总的说来，在帝国主义与蒋介石残匪的封锁与轰炸破坏的情况下，在华东农村灾情严重的情况下，上海市能获得公债税收的大部完成，获得物价的稳定，有效地制止了敌人空中的破坏，这证明中央人民政府领导的正确，证明政府和各界人民的团结，是能够从经济困难的环境中打开走向好转的出路的。这是极其重大的成就。这些成就指出光明的前途，宣告帝国主义与蒋匪的破坏上海的失败。
  物价稳定煤粮自给打破上海畸形规律
    陈市长接着就稳定物价、目前经济困难以及今后上海的发展趋势，作了详细的分析。他说：我们多年生活在上海的人们，历来为通货膨胀所苦恼，为物价波动所苦恼。历来上海市民需用的煤粮要依靠国外的供应才能维持。从事正当工商业的人们，历来为投机获暴利的专家们所左右，许多人或者是被迫抛弃正当事业而加入投机集团，或者是被迫停业破产。这是帝国主义统治下旧上海社会的畸形规律，以前是无法改变的。现在处在新民主主义管理之下的上海，不管尚有各种不利的和困难的条件存在，但时间只有十个月，却打破了旧规律，创造了煤粮和日用品依靠国内能充分供应，物价转入稳定，脱出通货膨胀的苦海，这不是很奇怪吗？这不是出乎一般人的意料吗？请各位回忆去年十月到十一月间物价暴涨，由上海波及全国，广大人民为物价波动所苦恼，其所受损失多么严重。当时人们以物价能否稳定来判断人民政府的政策和领导能力，甚至有人绝不相信人民政府有稳定物价的能力。去年十一月末，人民政府用各种努力把物价稳定下来，但有人说：“这还不可靠，我还要看一看！”他们预断农历正月初五日红盘市场一定大波动，到期八卦算不准。他们又预言三月物价非暴涨不可，他们口中念念有词，抹马厉兵，准备一个大进出，以便获取暴利。可是事与愿违，八卦又不准。这才开始怀疑自己了，开始相信上海正在起变化。我们并不鄙薄这些人，我们倒是欢迎他们真能获得教训和新的觉悟。为了促进他们觉悟起见，我们必须指出上海物价能够稳定，投机风暴能够抑制，主要原因是由于中央人民政府的政策是正确的，其领导是极坚强的。这并无秘诀，主要依靠惩公粮、整理税收、发行公债及财经统一，而不依靠通货发行。我们承认人民政府稳定物价这件事办得好，就应该承认公粮公债和税收政策之正确，就应该踊跃去完成为报效国家的各种负担如公债和纳税等任务。因为中央人民政府的工作是严格地依照为人民服务的原则的，其公粮公债和税收政策的重点是努力组织和引导全国工商业走入正常的恢复和发展的途径。中央人民政府对全国的财经进行了彻底的统一，他手中掌握了相当大的财力物力，正确的调剂全国市场。这个效果只是开始表现，往后更会在更大范围内和更高程度上表现出来。例如公债与税收政策，无疑义地是为了集中大的财力在中央人民政府手中，但人民政府是取之于民、用之于民的，人民政府不会将它浪费掉，而是保证用在正当途径上，特别是用在一切与恢复和发展生产有关的事业上面去。浩大的军费开支，是为了消灭残敌，也就是为了打开恢复经济的道路。今后的困难还会有很多，可是好转与光明的前景已经可以清楚看见了。上海在全国的经济恢复与改造上占着重要的地位，因而它在改造过程中表现的困难也一定是极其巨大的。我们不怕困难，忍受了这些困难、克服了这些困难，就将是好转的到来。
  努力克服目前困难争取经济情况好转
    陈市长接着又说：我们了解了上述的趋向，下列的四个问题就可以正确地了解。第一、我们便知道完成公债购买任务，完成纳税任务是应该的，而且要作特别的努力。只有如此才能保证军事上肃清残敌，完成中国的大统一；才能更巩固地稳定物价，更有保证地创造经济生产的恢复和发展的条件。纵然就上海全市来说，或者就个人来说，要暂时承受缩减与筹措的痛苦。这仍然是必要的。因为只有如此，才能逐渐走上好转的途径。光明的道路只有这一条，必须勇敢向前。第二、我们便知道许多高级消费性事业，许多适合投机取巧、损害市场正常化的事业必然要衰败。只有改造自己，符合人民利益，才有前途。因此，这种衰败与倒闭是不可避免的，是很痛苦的；但是不怕，如决心改造，反而是新生和光明的前奏。第三、我们便知道许多正当工商业也有不能维持的现象，主要是销路呆滞、成本过高、原料缺乏和经营不得法，内部腐朽而不勇于改革，陷自己于困难境地。但这些都是暂时现象，在整个局势有利，如残敌消灭、物价稳定、农村工作进展、全国供求逐渐能适应的条件下，正当工商业的前途是极其光明的。主要应依靠自己的努力，作各种内部的改革，只要目前能够努力维持，便可渡过困难迎接大的恢复和发展。第四、我们便知道在上海市将要产生许多新的企业。例如：对广大人民生活有直接关系的公营事业正逐渐增加，这是应该欢迎的。在这一类事业中的私营部分应该服从公营的领导作适当调整与分工。公营企业能巩固、能发展，对私营企业仍是有利的。解放日报四月五日登载的东北人民政府高岗主席报告中指出：在东北公营工业、农业的大发展条件下，以沈阳市为例，该市私营工业家数增加了百分之二十三；其雇用工人数目，增加了百分之十八。这是最显著的事实，说明了公私兼顾政策之正确。在上述四方面来看，我们应勇敢说明困难，不隐瞒困难。我们可以预计，今后在上海的建设中，许多暂时的停闭是不能免的；暂时的失业失学，也是不能避免的。这些都是痛苦的现象，要能忍受。经过这些痛苦，是一定可以渡过困难，转入恢复与发展的良好途径的。以上是我对于新上海发展的趋势的说明。
    最后，陈市长扼要的指出了今后上海的工作任务是：在中央人民政府和华东军政委员会领导之下，支援前线，肃清残敌和镇压特务匪徒；号召劳资团结，努力维持工业生产，减少停闭现象；制订救济失业失学计划和进行一般难民救济工作；同时，努力完成并超过购买公债任务；保证税收任务的完成，坚决与逃税进行斗争。这就是从本届会议到四届各界代表会期间应做的工作，而且是紧急的斗争任务。
    陈市长并要求大会代表应根据中央人民政府的政策，和在上海市应该采取的实施办法，多作研究，多作解释，解除误会和疑难，使人人都能把目前困难与光明前途结合起来看，都有信心地通过目前的克服困难的步骤，以争取经济情况好转的到来。
