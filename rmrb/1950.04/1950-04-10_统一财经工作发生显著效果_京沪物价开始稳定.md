Unified Financial and Economic Work Achieves Significant Results
Beijing and Shanghai Prices Begin to Stabilize
Beijing
[This Newspaper] Reporter Jin Yu reports: The decision to unify national financial and economic work has been implemented for a short time, and prices in Beijing have shown initial stability. This huge change has been supported by the broad masses of the people. They have seen that this is the beginning of a new situation in China's economic construction. With the stabilization of prices, the credibility of the Renminbi is becoming more and more solid. For more than ten years, the Chinese people have suffered from price fluctuations, resulting in the abnormal mentality of "valuing goods over money." In the face of many new facts, this mentality has begun to reverse.

Popular Sentiment Generally Stabilizes, Markets Filled with Goods
The new facts are first manifested in the changes in the market supply and demand relationship in Beijing. In the past, the supply and demand relationship in the Beijing market was volatile and had been in a state of relative scarcity of goods and demand exceeding supply for a long time. This phenomenon became even more acute and prominent when prices rose. A major change began in March. Commodity markets generally show a situation of supply exceeding demand or supply and demand gradually becoming corresponding. Taking food, a necessity for citizens' lives, as an example, the amount of food on the market increased in March, but the sales volume decreased. In late March, the amount of grain listed on the exchange was more than 70 million jin, but the transaction volume was only more than 10 million jin, accounting for a little over 14% of the amount listed. This is very different from the previous average transaction volume accounting for more than 50% of the amount listed. For flour, more than 280,000 bags were listed in late March, and more than 20,000 bags were traded, with the transaction accounting for only a little over 7% of the amount listed. Flour has always been a target for grain merchants to compete for. When prices fluctuate, whatever amount is listed is traded, and even demand exceeds supply. But today, the phenomenon of vying for purchases has completely disappeared. Why is this? Of course, in March, many industrialists and businessmen needed to purchase public bonds and pay taxes, and had to sell their stocks at low prices, but more importantly, with state-owned commercial and cooperative sales in large quantities and prices turning to stability, the situation of merchants hoarding goods began to change. During this period, grain merchants often said in the market: "Don't be greedy for goods! The market is not looking up." Some also expressed surprise at the stability of prices: "It's really strange, grain is falling in price when the new crop is not yet available!" Many private flour mills' business personnel directly sold to the listed retail rice and flour merchants, and the answer they received was: "There are still things to sell, let's stop for a while." Why don't retail grain merchants replenish their goods? On the one hand, it is because they still have some goods in stock to meet retail sales, but more importantly, the customers who buy grain at the grain stores all say: "Prices are stable, enough grain to eat is enough, buying too much will cause insects." Those who have stock are busy selling, retail merchants who have goods to sell stop replenishing, citizens who have stored grain do not buy, and citizens who have no stored grain buy as much as they eat. In this way, grain has relatively increased.

The new facts are also reflected in the changes in grain exports and imports. The amount of grain imported in March was: more than 39 million jin in the first ten days, more than 37 million jin in the middle ten days, and more than 31 million jin in the last ten days. The amount of exports was: more than 3.3 million jin in the first ten days, more than 3.7 million jin in the middle ten days, and more than 3.9 million jin in the last ten days. It can be seen from the figures that imports gradually decreased and exports gradually increased. The main reason for this situation is that the price of grain in Beijing was slightly lower than that in Baoding and Zhangjiakou during this period.

RMB Credit is Higher, Number of Currency Savings Accounts Increases Sharply
The new facts are also reflected in the changes in the business of the savings department of the People's Bank of China's Beijing branch. This change reflects the citizens' trust in currency. The real-value savings of the savings department have always been welcomed by the citizens, and this can be explained by the gradual development of the department's business. But March was different. The total number of depositors in March was 11,318, a decrease of 1,582 from February. (Note: February has 28 days, excluding Spring Festival holidays and Sunday holidays, the bank's business hours are only 21 days. If calculated by ordinary months, the difference between February and March should be even greater.) The "rollover" or "cash withdrawal" of matured savings deposits also reversed the previous pattern. In the past, about two-thirds of matured deposits continued to be rolled over, and one-third withdrew cash; in March, the opposite was true, with withdrawals accounting for two-thirds and rollovers accounting for only one-third.

Another new situation accompanying this change is the sudden increase in the number of "currency savings" accounts opened in the department. The department's currency savings business started on August 10 last year, and few people have paid attention to it. From the beginning to the end of February this year, there were only three accounts in seven months, and the amount of deposits was very small. In March, the savings department's business personnel heard depositors ask for the first time: "Can deposits not be converted into real value?" In this month, 32 households voluntarily requested to open current currency savings accounts, with deposits of more than 2.1 billion yuan. Fifteen households opened three-month fixed accounts, with deposits of 4.59 million yuan (the above only includes the situation of the savings department, and does not include the branches of the People's Bank of China). The "unpopular" currency savings in the savings department's business for the past six months has begun to become active in March.

Shanghai
[This Newspaper Shanghai News] Special correspondent He Li reports: The unified national financial and economic work has achieved initial results in Shanghai, and Shanghai prices have begun to show initial stability in March.

Before March, prices in the city had shown signs of stability; in early March, various items successively began to stabilize; for a month now, there have been no major fluctuations. Taking several major materials as examples: Rice, consistently maintained a level of 270,000 yuan in March. Cotton cloth, according to the price list of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the leading cloth was 314,000 yuan per piece on March 1, and fell to 273,000 yuan by the end of the month. Cloth of equal quality was worth about 200,000 yuan at the end of the month. Yarn, calculated based on the Blue Phoenix brand 20-count yarn, was 6.55 million yuan per piece at the beginning of the month, and was only worth 4.9 million yuan on March 30. The government appropriately purchased to take care of yarn production, and the next day it rose back to 5.35 million yuan. In addition, the prices of bituminous coal, flour, cotton, and other general merchandise were stable.

Large Amounts of Currency Withdrawn, Treasury System Established
The reason for obtaining these achievements is first of all the large-scale supply of grain, coal, and cotton to the market, which has withdrawn currency. At the same time, tax collection is being rectified, and the phenomenon of serious tax evasion due to "self-declaration and actual payment" is being corrected. As of the end of March, Shanghai had collected a total of approximately 600 billion yuan in taxes. Excluding local taxes, a total of 368.2 billion yuan has been deposited into the central treasury. Although Shanghai's public bonds were not paid in full on schedule, 22.31 million shares (total subscribed 30.07 million shares) were paid in the last two days of March. Together with the payments made before March, the amount reached 610.9 billion yuan.

Bank deposit work has also been completed as expected. Deposits in state-owned banks and joint public-private banks alone have reached more than 1.1 trillion yuan, and deposits in private banks have reached a total of more than 1.38 trillion yuan. The funds withdrawn from the trade treasury, railway treasury, and other sources have not yet been included. To ensure cash is deposited into the treasury, Shanghai has established a financial treasury represented by the public treasury department of the People's Bank of China, a trade treasury represented by the business treasury of the People's Bank of China, and a railway treasury represented by the Bank of Communications. The establishment of the treasury system not only guarantees the unity of finance, but also ensures the reliable completion of the withdrawal task.

Government Provides Ample Supply of Several Major Materials
Second, the government has made ample supply of several major materials, especially the supply of rice. The People's Government had already planned for the supply of rice to Shanghai citizens this year. Therefore, before the decision to unify financial and economic work was promulgated, the attempts of many speculative rice merchants to hoard and speculate had been hit. For example, when the market opened on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, rice merchants generally saw a red market and deliberately raised prices. In order to stabilize the market, the Grain Company immediately sold at a low price of 270,000 yuan per dan. The rice merchants thought that the public's rice reserves were limited and competed to buy them. 43,000 dan were bought on the first day, 31,000 dan were bought on the second day, and only 19,000 dan were bought on the third day. Later, the price gradually decreased, and finally they could no longer buy. In order to gradually reduce the speculation and manipulation of rice merchants, our state-owned trading company has established retail stores throughout the city to directly serve the lives of the broad masses of working people. Now 50 retail stores have been established in the city, and the retail market has been partially controlled by the state, finally making it impossible for rice merchants to sell at prices stipulated by the state. Now the government has sufficient strength to stabilize the food market, and the era of free manipulation by speculative rice merchants is gone forever. In addition, there are necessary guarantees for fuel coal and cotton cloth, and there is still a surplus of cotton cloth.

Close National Coordination, Cunning Merchants Have No Opportunity
Third, another basic factor guaranteeing the stability of Shanghai's prices is that Shanghai has close national coordination and mutual support. Last year, because the national financial and economic work had not yet been unified, the forces of various economic departments could not closely coordinate, giving speculative merchants an opportunity to take advantage. For example, when the price surge occurred last November, the Shanghai Trading Company sold a large amount of materials, selling up to 70,000 dan of rice on the highest day, but still could not stabilize the market; after the unification of finance and economics, the nation's currency and materials could be unifiedly taken in and out according to plan, thus enabling prices in various places to maintain a certain level. The reason why our Grain Company was able to defeat the speculative activities of speculative merchants by selling a maximum of only 47,000 dan of rice during the Lunar New Year this year is precisely for this reason.

Due to the stability of prices, Shanghai has seen a new atmosphere that has been rare for more than ten years. That is, the general public values the value of currency, and people are willing to store Renminbi in their pockets.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Government is paying attention to helping solve some temporary difficulties of the Shanghai business community caused by the relative stability of prices. The problem of employee unemployment is being considered, and legitimate industrialists and businessmen are also being helped without affecting the national withdrawal plan. For example, in view of the low price of cotton yarn, which affects the production of yarn mills, our Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has appropriately purchased it, which is one example.

　　统一财经工作发生显著效果
    京沪物价开始稳定
    北京
    【本报讯】记者近宇报道：统一国家财政经济工作的决定执行不久，北京物价已呈现初步平稳。这一巨大的转变，得到广大人民的拥护。他们已看出这是中国经济建设新局面的开端。由于物价稳定，人民币的信用愈益稳固了。十多年来，中国人民饱受物价波动之苦而形成的“轻货币，重实物”的畸形心理，在许多新的事实面前开始扭转过来。
    人心普遍安定  物资充满市场
    新的事实，在北京首先表现在市场供求关系的变化。过去，北京市场的供求关系是变化多端的，而长时期都处在物资相对缺少、商品求过于供的状态中。在物价上涨时，这一现象更显得尖锐与突出。三月份开始了大转变。各商品市场普遍呈现出供过于求或供求渐趋相应的情况。就以市民生活必需的食粮来说，三月份上市量增多，而销售量却减少了。三月下旬，粮食交易所的上市量是七千余万斤，成交量才有一千余万斤，占上市量的百分之十四强。这和以往平均成交量占上市量的百分之五十以上相较是大不相同了。面粉一项，下旬上市二十八万余袋，成交二万余袋，成交仅占上市量的百分之七强。面粉一向是粮商争购的目标，在物价波动时上市多少就成交多少，甚至供不应求。但在今天，争购现象已完全消除了。这是为什么呢？固然，在三月份有许多工商业者需要购买公债和缴纳税款，不得不低价出售存货，但更重要的是：在国营商业、合作社大量售货，物价转向平稳的情况下，开始改变商人的囤货的情况。这个时期，市场上常听到粮商们说：“少贪货吧！行市不看涨。”也有对物价平稳表示奇怪的：“真邪行，青黄不接的时候粮食反落钱！”不少私营粉厂的业务人员迳向上市零售米面商进行兜售，所得到的回答是：“还有卖的，停停再说。”零售粮食商为什么不补进货物呢？一方面是由于他们还存有一部货物足以应付门市零售，而更重要的是，到各粮店买粮的主顾们都说：“物价平稳了，粮食够吃的就行，买多了也是留着生虫。”存货的忙于出售，有货卖的零售商暂停补进，有存粮的市民不买，没存粮的市民吃多少买多少。这样，粮食相对地增多了。
    新的事实，也表现在粮食的输出、输入的变化。三月份粮食输入量是：上旬三千九百余万斤，中旬三千七百余万斤，下旬三千一百余万斤。输出量是：上旬三百三十万余斤，中旬三百七十余万斤，下旬三百九十余万斤。在数字中可以看出输入渐次减少，输出逐渐增加。这一情况之所以出现，主要是在这一时期中北京粮价稍低于保定、张家口等地。
            人民币信用更高  货币储蓄户骤增
    新的事实还表现在人民银行北京分行储蓄部业务的变化，这种变化反映出市民对货币的信赖心理。储蓄部的折实储蓄一向为市民所欢迎，在该部业务的逐渐发展上可以说明这点。但在三月份却不同了。三月份的存户总计是一万一千三百十八户，较二月份减少了一千五百八十二户。（按：二月是二十八天，除春节休假，星期日例假外，银行营业时间仅二十一天。若以平常月份计算，二、三两月的差额还应更大。）在到期的储蓄存款“转存”或是“提现”上也一反以往的规律。在过去，到期存款继续转存的约占三分之二，提取现款的占三分之一；三月份中恰恰相反，提现的为三分之二，转存的只剩下三分之一。
    伴随着这一变化而来的另一新情况，是在该部“货币储蓄”开户的骤然增加。该部货币蓄储业务从去年八月十日开始办理，一向很少有人过问。由开始到今年二月底七个月中只有三个户头，并且存款额都很少。在三月份，储蓄部的业务人员第一次听到存户这样的问话：“存款能不能不折实？”在这个月份中，自动要求开立活期货币储蓄的户头有三十二户，存入的金额在二十一亿元以上。开立三个月定期户头的十五户，存入金额四百五十九万元（以上仅是储蓄部的情况，未包括人民银行各办事处）。半年来储蓄部业务上的“冷门”——货币储蓄，在三月份已经开始活跃了。
            上海
    【本报上海讯】特派记者贺笠报道：全国财经统一工作在上海已获初步成效，三月份上海物价已开始出现初步稳定现象。
    在三月份以前，全市物价已有稳定迹象；至三月初旬，各物相继开始初步平稳；至今一个月以来已无大的波动。以几种主要物资为例：米，三月份始终保持二十七万元的水平。纱布，依据花纱布公司牌价，三月一日龙头布每匹三十一万四千元，至月底跌至二十七万三千元。与此质量相等的布匹月底约值二十万元。纱以蓝凤牌二十支纱为标准计算，月初每件六百五十五万元，至三月三十日仅值四百九十万元。政府为照顾纱业生产乃适当收购，次日即回涨至五百三十五万元。此外，烟煤、面粉、棉花以及其他百货价格均呈平稳。
            大量货币回笼  金库制度建立
    获得这些成绩的原因，首先是大量供给市场粮煤与棉花使货币回笼。同时整理税收，开始纠正因“自报实缴”而实际漏税严重的现象，截至三月底止，上海共收税款约六千亿元，除地方税款外，已入中央金库的计三千六百八十二亿。上海公债虽未按期缴足，但三月份最后两天，已缴二千二百三十一万余分（总计认购三千零七万分），连三月以前所缴款项，计达六千一百零九亿元。
    银行存款工作亦按预期完成，仅国家银行及公私合营银行存款即达一万一千余亿元，连私营银行存款，共达一万三千八百余亿元。而贸易金库、铁道金库等回笼款项尚未计入。为保证现金入库，上海已建立由人民银行公库部代理的财政金库，由人民银行业务库代理的贸易金库，由交通银行代理的铁道金库，由于金库制度的建立，不仅保证了财政的统一，也使回笼任务得到可靠的保证。
            政府充分供应几种主要物资
    第二、政府对几种主要物资作了充分的供应，尤其是米的供给，人民政府对今年供应上海市民食米早已预作筹划，因此在财经统一工作决定颁布之前，许多投机米商囤积居奇的企图即曾受打击。如旧历年初五开盘时，一般米商均看红盘，故意抬价，粮食公司为稳定市场，当即按每石二十七万元低价抛售，米商以为公家存米有限，竞相购买，第一天买去四万三千石，第二天又买三万一千石，到第三天就只买了一万九千石，以后陆续降低，终于不能再买。为了逐渐减少米商的投机操纵，我国营贸易公司在全市开展零售店，以便直接为广大劳动人民生活服务。现在全市已建立五十个零售店，零售市场已为国家部分掌握，终使米商不能不按照国家规定价格出售。现在政府已有充足力量稳定食粮市场，投机米商自由操纵的时代是一去不复返了。此外，燃煤与纱布均有了必要的保证，纱布尚有剩余。
            全国密切配合  奸商无机可乘
    第三、保证上海物价稳定的另一个基本因素，就是上海有着全国密切的配合，互为支援。去年由于全国财经工作尚未统一，各经济部门的力量还不能密切配合，使投机商人有机可乘。如去年十一月涨风发生时，上海贸易公司大量抛售物资，最高的一天曾抛出七万石米，仍不能稳定市场；财经统一后，全国货币与物资均能按计划统一吐纳，因而使各地物价能够维持一定的水平，今年旧历年关，我粮食公司之所以能够最多只抛出米四万七千石即打垮了投机商人的投机活动。其原因即在于此。
    由于物价的稳定，上海已出现十余年来少见的新气象。就是一般人民都重视币值，人们的腰包里都愿存放人民币。
    上海市人民政府对于由于物价的稳定而相对产生的上海工商界某些暂时困难，正在注意帮助解决。对职工失业问题正加以考虑，在不影响全国回笼计划之下，对正当工商业者亦正在设法扶持。如鉴于棉纱价格太低，影响纱厂生产，我花纱布公司已酌予收购，即为一例。
