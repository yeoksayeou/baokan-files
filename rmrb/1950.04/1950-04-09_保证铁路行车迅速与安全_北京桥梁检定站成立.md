　　To accurately determine the load-bearing capacity of railway bridges across the country and ensure the swiftness and safety of train operations, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has established the Beijing Bridge Inspection Station to inspect railway bridges in northern China. It has also been decided to successively establish inspection stations in southern and northeastern China. Bridge experts and engineers from the Ministry of Railways have studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in bridge maintenance, and based on the current condition of China's bridges, have formulated bridge inspection regulations to serve as the working standard for the inspection stations. The inspection station began its work on the 5th of April, and it is scheduled to first complete the inspection of bridges in urgent need of inspection on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line and the Jinpu line, which have the largest volume of transportation in the country, within April, May and June.

　　Regarding the understanding of the load-bearing capacity of railway bridges in our country, past estimations were generally relied upon. If the estimation is too high, it is extremely easy to cause danger when trains exceeding the weight limit pass over the bridge; if the estimation is too low, it will inevitably add many unreasonable slow-downs, affecting transportation speed. The work of the bridge inspection station is to use scientific methods to inspect the load-bearing capacity of bridges and formulate standards for train speed on the bridges.

　　保证铁路行车迅速与安全
    北京桥梁检定站成立
    【新华社讯】为确切明了全国铁路桥梁的载重能力，保证行车的迅速与安全，中央人民政府铁道部特成立北京桥梁检定站，以检查北方铁路桥梁；并决定陆续成立南方及东北检定站。铁道部桥梁专家、工程师等研究了苏联养护桥梁的先进经验，并根据我国桥梁现状，已制出桥梁检定规程，作为检定站的工作标准。该检定站已于五日起开始工作，并预定在四、五、六、三个月内首先将全国运输量最大的北京至山海关线、津浦线上急需检定的桥梁检定完毕。
    按我国对铁路桥梁载重能力的了解，过去一般的只靠估计。估计过高，超过重量的列车从桥上经过，极易发生危险；估计过低，又势必增添许多不合理的徐行，影响运输速度。桥梁检定站的工作，就是用科学的方法，检查桥梁载重能力，制出桥上行车速度的标准。
