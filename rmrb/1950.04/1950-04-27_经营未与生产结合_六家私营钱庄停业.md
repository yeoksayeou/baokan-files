　　Operation Not Integrated with Production
　　Six Private Money Shops Close Down
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Yongtaicheng, Yuxingzhong, Hengtaiderunxing, Dadeheng, and Fucheng private money shops in Beijing, because their operations were not well integrated with production, specializing in high-interest lending, suffered excessive losses after prices stabilized, and were unable to continue business. After being reported to the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, they were approved to suspend operations for liquidation between April 14th and 26th. Since registering for business last year, Yongtaicheng Money Shop was penalized for manipulating accounts and trafficking gold. Most of its lending was aimed at speculative activities. Now that prices have stabilized and speculative activities have lost their socio-economic foundation, bad debts have accumulated. Coupled with its weak capital base and high expenditures, losses reached 130 million yuan by April 10th, accounting for one-half of total deposits, and funds could no longer be turned over. The other five money shops also failed because of improper management and their business could not continue, ultimately leading to closure.

　　经营未与生产结合
    六家私营钱庄停业
    【京市新闻处讯】京市永泰成、裕兴中、恒泰德润兴、大德恒、福成等六家私营钱庄，经营未与生产事业很好结合，专事高利存放款，物价平稳后，亏损过巨，业务无法进行，经呈准中国人民银行总行和北京市人民政府财经委员会先后于四月十四日至二十六日停业清理。永泰成钱庄自去年登记营业后，曾因经营后帐，贩运黄金受罚，存放款大部以投机倒把为对象，现在物价平稳，投机倒把已失去社会经济基础，以致呆帐累累，加以本身资金薄弱，开支庞大，到四月十日亏损达一亿三千万元，占存款总额二分之一，资金已无法周转。其他五家钱庄也因经营不当，业务不能继续，终至于倒闭。
