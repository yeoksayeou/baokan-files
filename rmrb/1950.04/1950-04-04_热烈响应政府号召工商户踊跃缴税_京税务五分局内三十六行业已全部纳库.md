    [News from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: Since the collection of industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1949 in Beijing began on the 1st, various tax bureaus have held mobilization meetings and consulted with various industries, hoping that everyone will pay taxes as soon as possible. Now, with the industry appraisal committee members and group leaders taking the lead in paying taxes, industrial and commercial households throughout the city are enthusiastically responding to the government's call with action, actively paying and depositing funds early. As of yesterday, the Fifth Tax Bureau had collected over 380 million RMB (People's Currency), equivalent to over 7,000 catties of rice coupons. One-third of the industrial and commercial households have completed the glorious task of paying taxes. Nineteen industries, including tea shops, soy sauce manufacturing, leather goods and suitcases, pork shops, fireworks, hardware, radio, cotton, wool, Western-style clothing, laundry, embroidery, photography, dyeing, leather, dentures, dried and fresh fruits, pork soup pots, and well water, have all paid their taxes in full. Including those before, thirty-six industries have gloriously completed their tasks. After issuing payment notices, the Fourth Tax Bureau held a mobilization meeting at the China Theater yesterday. Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Taxation Bureau, and Li Rui and Yang Yuzheng, Chiefs of the Ninth and Eleventh Districts, attended and spoke at the meeting. At the meeting, Zhang Lanshan, leader of the sixth group of the paper and stationery industry, first challenged other industries and groups to compete on who paid the earliest. Yao Wenhui, Chairman of the Grain Store Association, said: The country's difficulties are the people's difficulties. He guaranteed that the grain stores would pay into the treasury within two or three days. After the meeting, five companies, including Yongguang, paid their taxes under the leadership of group leader Lü Zizhen. In addition, Yixingxiang Dyeing Factory and three denture businesses including Lichang, four glasses businesses including Hu Yueting, two jewelry businesses including Tianyuan, and Tiangong of the ball club industry, all immediately paid their taxes after receiving payment notices yesterday. The Second Tax Bureau is in charge of the appraisal work of the city's cinema industry. After the appraisal was completed on the 25th of last month, Yang Yizhi, Chairman of the industry association and manager of the Da Guangming Theater, called on his colleagues to pay taxes early and challenged all industrial and commercial households within the Second Tax Bureau's jurisdiction to compete for the model red flag. On the 1st, after receiving the payment notices, all the theaters paid their taxes in full on the 2nd. By yesterday, the First Tax Bureau had seen five industries, including shoe materials, complete their tax payments, with 490 industrial and commercial households paying a total of over 153,000 catties of millet. After receiving the payment notice, Zhang Weiting, the group leader of the rice and flour industry in District One within the bureau's jurisdiction, immediately convened a meeting of the industry, guaranteeing to pay into the treasury within five days and proposing to challenge the rice and flour industry within the Fifth Tax Bureau's jurisdiction. The Third Tax Bureau has seen the pork and mutton casing industry pay its taxes in full. The bureau is preparing to hold a mobilization meeting for early tax payment by industry and commerce at the Dazhong Cinema and Theater this morning (the 4th).
