Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch from TASS: The United States Supreme Court, on March 27th, ruled by a vote of five to two to uphold the original sentence of the New York Federal Court against Dennis, General Secretary of the American Communist Party. Dennis was sentenced by the New York Federal Court on March 19, 1947, to one year imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 for the so-called "contempt of Congress" for refusing to answer the unconstitutional questioning of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Supreme Court Justices Frankfurter and Black dissented from the court's majority ruling to uphold Dennis's original sentence. They pointed out that Dennis did not receive a fair trial because some government personnel on the jury would suffer persecution if they did not convict communists and other progressives. Frankfurter also stated: "In the era in which we now live, jurors will be persecuted if they disagree." Black also stated: "Under the threat of the current loyalty investigations and purges, it is completely unrealistic to expect government personnel participating in juries to possess the impartiality necessary for complete fairness."

　　美最高法院横蛮行动
    竟维持对但尼斯原判
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国最高法院于三月二十七日以五对二票判决维持纽约联邦法院对美共总书记但尼斯的原判。但尼斯系因拒绝答复众院非美活动委员会的违宪讯问，而于一九四七年三月十九日被纽约联邦法院以所谓“蔑视国会”罪判处徒刑一年罚金一千美元。最高法院法官佛兰克福特与布赖克不同意法院多数关于维持但尼斯原判的判决。他们指出：但尼斯并没有受到公平的审判，因为陪审官中的一些政府人员，如果不判定共产党人和其他进步分子有罪，就会遭受迫害。佛兰克福特并称：“在我们现在所生活的时代，陪审官如果不同意也会受到迫害。”布赖克亦称：“在当前的忠诚调查与清洗运动的威胁下，如果期望参加陪审团的政府人员具有完全公平所必需的大公无私的品质，那是完全不现实的。”
