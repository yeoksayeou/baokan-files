　　Measures for the Levy of Industrial and Commercial Tax in the Lüda District
　　By our reporter Lù Chāo Qí
　　The Lüda District Tax Bureau has created an advanced system for managing industry and commerce and methods for levying industrial and commercial tax, fundamentally eliminating tax evasion, ensuring fair and reasonable burdens, and pioneering a new direction for the collection of industrial and commercial tax.
　　Since liberation, Lüda has made significant progress in municipal administration, economic construction, and cultural construction. The same is true for taxation. From 1946, the Lüda District used the method of tax assessment based on accounting records to levy industrial and commercial tax. However, at that time, the account books used by industrial and commercial businesses were not standardized, false accounts were common, and auditing was troublesome, resulting in significant tax evasion. It was not until after 1948 that planned efforts were made to strengthen industrial and commercial management and closely coordinate with anti-smuggling efforts to eliminate tax evasion. After two years of exploration, the current advanced system was finally achieved.

　　I. Organize Industrial and Commercial Groups
　　The role of the industrial and commercial groups is to enable mutual supervision and assistance among industrial and commercial operators, facilitating tax bureau management. The organization of groups is based on administrative regions, combined with the prosperity of the streets, with every ten to twenty households forming a group; three or four groups then form a central group (or large group). The group leader is democratically elected by each business and approved by the tax bureau. To facilitate the work, progressive small and medium-sized business owners or shop assistants should be chosen as group leaders, with no fixed term of office. If a majority of business operators or the tax bureau deem it unsuitable, opinions can be raised and new elections held at any time.

　　The group leader becomes a powerful assistant to the tax bureau. His main tasks are to assist in tax collection, receive, issue, and review monthly business reports for each household under his jurisdiction, urge payment of overdue taxes, report tax evasion, publicize and explain government tax laws and various collection methods, guide the recording and management of account books and invoices, promptly reflect the dynamics of industrial and commercial operators, and propose opinions on tax reductions and exemptions, as well as penalties. The result greatly strengthens the relationship between industrial and commercial operators and the tax bureau.

　　When the group leader system was first implemented, some group leaders were afraid of offending others and were unwilling to serve. Therefore, leading organs should pay attention to dispelling their ideological concerns and enhancing their prestige. Their correct opinions should be respected in matters such as penalties and reductions. At the same time, a reward and punishment system should be established, and evening parties, report meetings, etc., should be held within a certain period to increase their work enthusiasm and ability. Based on this, political education should be systematically conducted, and individual good shop assistants can also be promoted to tax cadres.

　　II. Establish Uniform Account Books
　　Since 1948, the Lüda District has established uniform new-style bookkeeping. Generally, medium-sized businesses are required to use three types of books: general ledger, cash book, and journal (those selling goods add a merchandise ledger). Small businesses only use a small cash book. Large businesses and factories can prepare supplementary books in addition to the prescribed books, but they must be registered with the tax bureau. The account books are uniformly printed by the Administrative Office Tax Bureau, then registered and numbered by each tax sub-bureau and distributed to industrial and commercial operators.

　　The benefits of doing so are, first, it is easy to check, preventing illegal merchants from falsifying accounts and reducing tax evasion. Second, it is very convenient when calculating income tax, as inventory can be understood at any time, and net profit can be calculated.

　　III. Universally Implement Uniform Invoices
　　Uniform invoices were first implemented in large industrial and commercial businesses starting in June of last year. This January, except for special industries such as street vendors, barber shops, and bathhouses, all factories, shops, and stalls have universally implemented them.

　　After the implementation of uniform invoices, every transaction in the store has a stub that can be checked, so auditing is much easier. It can also prevent black market and private sales by merchants. Since Lüda District implemented uniform invoices, no one buys goods without qualified invoices.

　　Effective ways to manage invoices are: (1) Develop uniform formats according to industry needs, and have them printed by government-designated printing plants; then the tax bureau uniformly distributes them to each business for use. (2) Through the industrial and commercial groups, mobilize merchants to establish their own reward and punishment systems, jointly take responsibility, and supervise each other. (3) Through the police departments, vigorously publicize so that the general public can actively request invoices when buying goods. (4) Tax officials and police conduct surprise inspections at any time.

　　IV. Establish a System of Dedicated Management by Cadres
　　The dedicated management system is to divide tax inspectors into groups of two. Based on the industrial and commercial groups, the jurisdiction of each group is determined, with each tax inspection group in charge of about a dozen industrial and commercial groups, or about two hundred businesses. The allocation of cadres is generally a combination of those familiar with the business and those who are politically progressive. In addition to being responsible for reviewing industrial and commercial taxes, calculating tax bills, and urging payment of taxes within their jurisdiction, each tax inspection group must also be responsible for investigating the industrial and commercial changes in the area, and constantly contacting the masses at all levels to carry out anti-smuggling work. Therefore, now, generally, cadres, because they go deep into reality and connect with reality, know the business, profits, and historical situation of the merchants they manage like the back of their hand. This overcomes the blindness in calculating tasks. Also, since the examination and collection are the responsibility of the group, the collection task is specifically assigned to each group based on statistical materials, and each group must guarantee the completion of the task. This strengthens the cadres' sense of responsibility, achieves true layered responsibility, and merchants dare not arbitrarily forge accounts to evade taxes.

　　Each tax sub-bureau must also establish reward and punishment systems and reporting systems for the dedicated groups. During the collection period, the sub-bureau can also publish and compare the tasks completed by each group every day. This not only encourages cadres to work actively, but also makes it easier for leading organs to understand the situation in a timely manner. According to statistics from Dalian City from January 1st to February 20th this year, each group can complete the task on time and exceed the quota.

　　The above is the advanced system for managing industry and commerce created by the Lüda District. Based on this system, the methods for levying industrial and commercial taxes in the Lüda District are as follows: (1) Business tax is collected by the operators reporting and paying the actual amount monthly, followed by auditing. The tax bureau distributes the monthly business report form to each operator through the industrial and commercial group leaders, and collects them within three days and sends them to the tax bureau; the tax inspection group calculates the payable amount according to the tax rate, makes three copies of the form, gives them to the industrial and commercial group leaders, distributes them to each household, and then goes to the bank to pay the money. During the collection period, the tax inspection group urges the payment of taxes, reviews the business situation of each household, and fully uses mass relations to carry out anti-smuggling. (2) Income tax is levied based on accounting records, collected every six months. The collection of income tax mainly focuses on the inventory and expense expenditure of the business. The tax bureau not only evaluates the inventory of goods, but also has certain principles for the expense expenditure. Otherwise, it will affect net profit and reduce tax revenue. Therefore, the collection of income tax has progressed to not adopting the method of operators reporting and paying the actual amount first, followed by auditing, but instead, tax officials (dedicated management group) investigate each household, calculate the tax based on the accounts, and write the tax payment slip after the operator approves it.

　　The Lüda District did not have smooth sailing in establishing this advanced system for managing industry and commerce. Especially when establishing uniform account books and universally implementing the invoice system, many difficulties were encountered. First, what if they cannot write? The tax bureau mobilized them to enroll in literacy classes at night, with cadres and industrial and commercial group leaders conducting literacy education; on the other hand, they wrote the names of the goods on paper cards and placed them on the items, writing based on the paper cards when selling goods, or carving rubber stamps according to the types of goods, and stamping them on the invoices when selling goods, etc. Should invoices only be required for transactions exceeding a certain amount; if stipulated, the entire turnover would be inaccurate, losing the function of writing invoices; if a certain transaction amount is not stipulated, then would the cost of invoices used for some scattered transactions be too high? After a period of experimentation, the district believes that it is better not to stipulate it. Because the cost of invoices used by general small businesses per month does not exceed 1% of their monthly turnover; at the same time, after using invoices, buyers can no longer not give small change and must have cash and invoice amount fully match, so merchants lose less, which can compensate for the cost of invoices. Second, what if merchants or private inventory cannot be sold without invoices? The Lüda District stipulates that merchants generally have to sell through agent stores, and the agent stores can issue invoices on their behalf and pay taxes on their behalf; if not going to the agent store, they can write their own invoices, pay taxes to the tax bureau first, and they are also valid after being stamped by the tax bureau. When starting to use the new-style bookkeeping, although the new bookkeeping itself is very simple, some difficulties were also encountered. This requires the tax bureau to provide good assistance. First, teach the industrial and commercial group leaders how to keep books, and then have the group leaders guide each business in bookkeeping. At the same time, help merchants run amateur bookkeeping training classes, and general shop employees and workers are happy to participate. After a period of time, it will be universally implemented.

　　Because the Lüda District has implemented these advanced systems for managing industry and commerce and collecting industrial and commercial taxes, it has not only played a great role in promoting tax work and improving work efficiency, but also greatly streamlined cadres. The district has more than 11,000 industrial and commercial households, and although there are only 133 cadres in total, all business reports can be submitted to the tax bureau within three days. For example, Dalian City, which has 7,225 industrial and commercial households, used to have more than 200 cadres, and business tax was collected every three months. Now there are only 68 cadres, and business tax has been changed to once a month, and it does not feel difficult. After the Central People's Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax, the city was able to clear the entire commodity market within three days. And tax assessment based on accounting records can ensure that the burden is fair and reasonable. In addition, it has made greater contributions to mobilizing the masses to fight smuggling and eliminating tax evasion. For example, last year, the district's revenue from just regular taxes—business tax, income tax, and factory tax (according to Lüda District's factory tax last year, it only refers to four types of goods: salt, tobacco, alcohol, and soft drinks, and other goods were not taxed)—exceeded 9% of the total funds of the entire district.

　　旅大区征收工商业税的办法
    本报记者  陆超祺
    旅大区税务局，创造了先进的管理工商业制度和征收工商业税的办法，从根本上杜绝了漏税，且做到负担公平合理，开创了征收工商业税的新方向。
    解放以后的旅大，在市政管理、经济建设和文化建设等方面，都有显著的进步。在税务工作方面，也是如此。从一九四六年起，旅大区就用查账计税的办法征收工商业税。但那时，工商业户用的账簿不统一，假账很多，查账也很麻烦，结果偷漏税现象仍为数不少。一直至一九四八年以后，才有计划地从加强工商业管理，密切配合缉私来杜绝漏税。经过了两年的摸索，终于获得了现行的先进制度。
            一、组织工商业小组
    工商业小组的作用，是使各工商业者互相监督和互助，便于税局对工商业的管理。小组的组织，是按行政区域，配合街道繁荣情况，每十户到二十户划为一小组；三、四小组再组成一个中心组（或称大组）。组长由各商号民主选举，并经税务局同意。为了便于进行工作，应以进步的中、小工商业者或店员为组长，任期不固定，如多数工商业者或税局认为不适宜时，随时都可提出意见，重新选举。
    小组长成为税局的有力助手。他的任务主要是协助收税，收发、审查每月所管各户的营业报告表，催促拖欠的税款，检举偷漏税行为，宣传解释政府的税收法令及各种稽征办法，指导账簿和发货票的记载与管理，及时反映工商业者的动态，提出税款减免与处罚的意见。结果大大的密切了工商业者与税局的关系。
    小组长制度在开始实行时，有些小组长怕得罪别人而不愿意当。故领导机关应注意解除他们的思想顾虑和提高他们的威信。如处罚、减免等要尊重他们正确的意见。同时应定出奖惩制度，和在一定时期内举行晚会、报告会等，以便提高他们的工作热忱和能力。并以此为基础，再系统地进行政治教育，个别好的店员，还可以提拔为税务干部。
            二、建立统一的账簿
    自一九四八年起，旅大区就建立统一的新式簿记。一般中等商户规定要用总账、现金账和日记账三种（贩卖商品者增加商品账）。小商号只用一本小型的现金账。大的商号和工厂除了规定的账簿以外，还可以自备辅助账，但须一同到税局登记。账簿由行署税务局统一印制，然后经过各税务分局登记编号，发配给工商业者。
    这样做的好处，首先是便于检查，防止不法商人做假，减少了偷税行为。其次，在计算所得税时很方便，随时都可以了解库存，计算纯益额。
            三、普遍实行统一的发货票（发票）
    统一的发票，从去年六月起，首先在大的工商户实行。今年一月，除了街头小贩、理发店、澡塘等特殊的行业外，所有的工厂、商店和摊贩都已普遍实行。
    实行统一的发票后，商店的每次交易都有存根可查，因此查账就容易得多了。而且还可以防止黑市和行商的私自买卖。因为旅大区自实行统一的发票以后，没有合格的发票的商品是没有人买的。
    管理发票的有效办法是：（一）按行业需要制定统一的格式，并分别由政府指定的印刷厂印制；然后由税局统一发给各商户使用。（二）通过各工商业小组，发动商人自己订立奖惩制度，共同负责，互相监督。（三）通过警政部门，大力宣传，使一般群众在买货时都能主动地要发票。（四）税务人员、警察随时突击检查。
            四、建立干部专责管理制度
    专责管理制度，就是把查税人员每二人划分为一小组。以工商业小组为基础，确定各小组的管辖区，每一查税小组约管辖十几个工商业小组、二百来户商号。干部的配备，一般是以业务熟悉者与政治进步者相配合。各查税小组除负责其管辖区内工商业税的审查，计算税单，催征税款以外，并须负责调查该区内的工商业变动状况，以及经常联系各阶层的群众，展开缉私工作。故到现在一般干部由于他们深入实际，联系实际，对自己管理的商户的营业、利润以及历史情况，都能了如指掌。这就克服了计算任务时的盲目性。又由于从查到征都由小组负责，把征收任务根据统计材料具体的分到每组身上，各小组必须保证完成任务。这样就加强了干部的责任心，做到真正的分层负责，而商人也不敢随便伪造账目，逃避税收了。
    各税务分局对于专责小组亦须建立奖惩制度和汇报制度。在征收的时候，分局还可以每天把各小组完成的任务公布比较。这不仅鼓励干部积极工作，而且领导机关也便于及时了解情况。根据大连市今年一月一日至二月二十日的统计，各小组都能按时超额完成任务。
    以上就是旅大区所创造的先进的管理工商业的制度。在这个制度的基础上，旅大区征收工商业税的办法是这样的：（一）营业税是采取先由业者按月自报实缴，以后查账的办法，税务局通过工商业小组长，把月份营业状况报告表分发给各业者填写，并在三天内收齐送到税务局；查税小组按税率计算纳金，作出三联单，交给工商业小组长，分发给各户，然后到银行缴款。查税小组在征收期间，一面催缴税款，一面复查各户营业情况，并充分运用群众关系，展开缉私。（二）所得税是按账查征的，半年一征。所得税的稽征，主要是掌握商户的库存和经费的开支。税局不仅对库存的货物定出评价，而且对经费的开支也有一定的原则。否则，就会影响纯益，减少税款收入。因此，所得税的征收，已进步到不采取先由业者自报实缴以后查账的办法，而是由税务人员（专责管理小组）逐户调查，按账计征，经过业者承认，便写纳税单。
    旅大区在建立这种先进的管理工商业的制度当中，并不是一帆风顺的。特别是建立统一的账簿和普遍实行发票制度的时候，曾经遇到很多困难，首先是不会写字的怎么办？税局一方面动员他们晚上入识字班，由干部及工商业小组长进行识字教育；另一方面，用纸牌把货名写出来放在物品上，卖货时仿着纸牌写，或是按商品种类刻胶皮戳，在卖货时盖在发票上等。发票是否要满一定的交易额才需用；如果规定了，则整个的营业额就不准确，失去写发票的作用；如果不规定一定的交易额，那末一些零星的交易所用的发票的费用是否太重？该区经试验一个时期后，认为还是不规定的好。因为一般小商号每月所用的发票的费用，总计不超过他每月营业额的百分之一；同时使用了发票，买主就再不能不给零账，必须是现款与票额完全相符，这样商人就少了一部分损失，可以弥补发票的费用。再次，行商或私人存货，没有发票不能出卖又怎么办？旅大区规定行商一般要经代理店出卖，可由代理店代开发票，代缴税款；不到代理店的，可以自写发票，先到税局缴税，经税局盖章后也同样有效。在开始使用新式簿记时，虽然新簿记本身很简单，但也遇到一些困难。这就需要税局很好的给予帮助。首先把簿记的记法教给工商业小组长，再由小组长指导各商号记账。同时帮助商人办业余簿记训练班，一般店员工友都很喜欢参加，经过一个时期以后，也就普遍的施行起来了。
    旅大区由于实行了这些先进的管理工商业制度和征收工商业税的办法，不但对推动税收工作，提高工作效率起了很大作用，而且还大大精简了干部。该区共有一万一千多户工商业，虽然全部干部不过一三三人，但三天内就可以将全部营业情况呈报到税局。又如拥有七、二二五户工商业的大连市，以前有干部二百余人，营业税三月一征，现在干部只有六十八人，而营业税改为一月一征，并不感觉困难。中央人民政府公布货物税暂行条例以后，该市在三天之内就能清理全部货物市场。且按账查征，负担也能做到公平合理。另外在发动群众力量缉私，杜绝偷漏税上贡献更大。如去年该区只正税——营业税、所得税和出厂税（按去年旅大区的出厂税，只指盐、烟、酒和清凉饮料四种货物，其他的未课税）——一项收入，就超过全区的资金总额的百分之九。
