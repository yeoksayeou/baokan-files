TASS, Rome, 8th: The Trieste Peace Committee cabled United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, stating: "The transport ship 'Excilona', carrying a shipment of American weapons for Italy, is announced to arrive in Trieste on April 12th. This fundamentally violates the peace treaty. The Treaty of Peace with Italy stipulates the integrity, demilitarization, and neutrality obligations of the Free Territory of Trieste, guaranteed by the United Nations. The Trieste Peace Committee, representing all parties, groups, and individuals participating in the committee, protests and requests the Security Council to intervene to prevent the unloading of military supplies in the port of Trieste and the use of Trieste as a military port." According to the Unity Daily, a broad movement of the working people of Trieste supporting the Peace Committee's telegram to the United Nations is expanding. A petition is currently being circulated for widespread signature by the people of the city. Numerous resolutions have been passed in factories in the urban area and neighboring villages, protesting the unloading of American military supplies in the port of Trieste. Workers in the iron, steel, and petroleum industries of Trieste have pledged to support the struggle of the Trieste port dockworkers against the unloading of American military supplies.
