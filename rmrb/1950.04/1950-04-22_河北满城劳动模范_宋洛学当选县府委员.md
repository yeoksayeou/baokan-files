Song Luoxue Elected as County Government Member

[This newspaper reported] Song Luoxue, a labor model from Songjia Village, District One, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, was elected as a representative to the County People's Congress immediately after returning from the North China Agricultural Technology Conference. On April 4th, he was also elected as a member of the County People's Government at the County People's Congress. He felt very honored and determined to lead the masses to improve production.

As soon as he returned to the village, he immediately convened a general meeting of party members of the village branch on the evening of the 8th in collaboration with the work team, and made ideological mobilization for completing the task of increasing production. At the meeting, he conveyed the resolutions of the County People's Congress, calling on party members to play an exemplary role and lead the masses to complete this year's task of increasing grain and cotton production, and immediately began preparing for cotton planting. More than 20 party members present unanimously guaranteed that their cotton seeds would all be selected within eight days, and each would lead three or two households to select cotton. The party members also proposed: if it does not rain, dibble-sow the seeds to ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan.

Then, village people's representative meetings and youth league members' and women's federation members' meetings were held, and mobilization work was also carried out. All league members proposed: cotton seeds must be selected within four days, and each person should lead two households. For example, female league member Song Lanxiang led her family of four and finished selecting 49 catties of cotton seeds in half a day. At the same time, extensive publicity and mobilization work was carried out using blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts. The masses of the whole village then acted to pre-select all cotton seeds before Guyu (Grain Rain), to ensure the completion of the plan to plant 900 mu of cotton.

In order to carry out the sub-area specific organization of mass mutual assistance, a meeting of the heads of villages and neighbors was also convened. Six mutual aid groups have been organized within three days. On the 9th, he also collaborated with Zhao Guofu from the County Farm to convene a meeting of the technical promotion team cadres of six villages (including Songjia) in the "Er Bi Cotton" (superior varieties) area to study and do a solid job of preparing for cotton planting and specific measures to ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan. In order to ensure the preservation and harvest of cotton, a unified cotton planting agreement for the six villages was jointly formulated, such as adjusting cotton varieties, all villages should plant Er Bi Cotton; applying more fertilizer and hoeing more; topping, pruning, and selecting seeds in time; preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, etc., more than a dozen items, everyone abided by them together, which played a guaranteed role in completing the task of planting 2,700 mu of cotton in the six villages and maintaining the purity of the excellent varieties.

The masses of all villages felt that Song Luoxue's election as a member of the County People's Government was not only Song Luoxue's honor, but also the honor of all working people. Currently, under the leadership and assistance of Song Luoxue, they are selecting cotton seeds, harrowing cotton fields, and sowing all other spring crops, determined to complete the task of increasing cotton and grain production as decided by the County People's Congress.

　　河北满城劳动模范
    宋洛学当选县府委员
    【本报讯】河北满城县一区宋贾村劳动模范宋洛学，自参加华北农业技术会议回来，即被选为出席县人民代表大会的代表，四月四日在县人民代表大会上，又当选了县人民政府委员。他觉得很光荣，决心带动群众把生产搞好。
    刚一回村，即于八日晚协同工作组召开了本村支部党员大会，为完成增产任务作了思想动员。会上，他传达了县人民代表大会的决议，号召党员起模范作用，带动群众完成今年增产粮棉任务，立即着手准备种棉工作。到会二十多个党员，一致保证自己的棉籽在八天当中全部拣好，并各带动三两户群众进行拣棉。党员们并提出：不下雨就点播，保证完成种棉计划。
    接着又开了村人民代表大会和青年团员、妇联会员大会，同样进行了动员工作。全体团员提出：四天之内一定拣完棉种，并每人带动两户群众。如女团员宋兰香带动全家四口人，在半天内就把四十九斤棉籽拣完了。同时，利用黑板报、屋顶广播展开广泛的宣传鼓动工作。全村群众接着行动起来，预定在谷雨前全部拣完棉种，保证完成种棉九百亩的计划。
    为了进行分片具体组织群众互助，又召开了闾邻长会议。三天内已组织起六个互助组。九日，他又协同县农场赵国福召集了“二比棉”（优良品种）区六个村（宋贾在内）的技术推广小组干部会议，研究切实做好种棉的一切准备工作和保证完成种棉计划的具体办法。为了使棉花保种保收，共同制定了六个村统一的植棉公约，如调整棉种，各村一律种二比棉；多施肥，多锄；及时打尖、打杈、选种；防治病虫害等十几项，大家共同遵守，对六个村完成种棉二千七百亩的任务和保持优良品种的纯良起了保证作用。
    各村群众对宋洛学当选县人民政府委员，不仅觉得是宋洛学的光荣，而且也是全体劳动人民的光荣。现正在宋洛学领导与帮助下，进行拣棉籽、打耙棉田及播种其他一切春季作物，决心完成县人民代表大会所决定的增产棉粮任务。（满城县通讯员  王德瑞）
