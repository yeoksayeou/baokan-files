　　Reply to Hua Da Li Zhijun:
　　Citizens can report those addicted to opium to the local Public Security Bureau police station or sub-bureau. The Public Security Bureau basically adopts educational rehabilitation methods for the reported individuals. If he does not change after education, the Public Security Bureau will transfer him to the People's Court for handling.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor Jiang Zhimou Comrade:
　　It is permissible for you to buy some stamps to send to your home in the Central China Region for use. However, the stamps previously printed and issued separately by each region cannot be used in other regions. You must buy the various nationally applicable stamps currently sold at post offices and send them by registered mail; the stamps commonly used in the North China Region in April, May, and June of this year can also be used in the Central China Region.

　　简复华大李致君：
    对染有烟毒嗜好者，市民可向当地公安局派出所或分局检举。公安局对被检举者的处理，基本上均采取教育戒除的办法。如他经教育不改，公安局则将他转送人民法院处理。
                                                     编者蒋志谋同志：
    你打算买些邮票寄到华中区的家里使用，是可以的。但以前各区单独印发的邮票，别区不能通用。你必须买各邮局现售全国通用的各种邮票挂号寄去；在本年四、五、六月华北区通用的邮票，寄到华中区也可以通用。
