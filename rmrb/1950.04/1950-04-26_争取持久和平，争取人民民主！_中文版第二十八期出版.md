　　Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 28 (Total No. 67) was published here on the 22nd. This issue's important content is the publication of the Communiqué, Treaty and Agreements between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union regarding the conclusion of the treaty and agreements, and prominently features the Soviet Pravda editorial "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!". In addition, this issue also contains an important essay by Vulko Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, "Lessons Learned from the Exposure and Elimination of the Traicho Kostov Gang."

　　Chervenkov's essay focuses on analyzing the reasons why Kostovism was not previously exposed. He seriously pointed out the serious shortcomings existing in the work of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In analyzing these shortcomings, Chervenkov pointed out: there has long been a confused view widely prevalent in the Bulgarian Communist Party, namely that the development of the Bulgarian state has a special path, and that the class struggle after the liberation of Bulgaria on September 9, 1944, would gradually diminish. This confused view paralyzed the vigilance of the people. As Georgi Dimitrov pointed out: this is an underestimation of the inevitable intensification of the class struggle under our conditions, during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism; an underestimation of the strength of the reactionaries; an underestimation of the strength, possibilities, and abilities of the working class and all working people. Furthermore, Chervenkov pointed out: the lack of necessary collective work system in the leading body of the Party Central Committee and its executive and standing bodies; the serious existence of liberalism in the Central Committee; uncritical trust in old experts, failure to promote outstanding new cadres from the ranks of the working class to the leading bodies of the Party and the state, and the low level of theoretical knowledge within the Party, etc., all allowed the enemy to find gaps to exploit and have a base for activity.

　　In response to the above-mentioned shortcomings, Chervenkov pointed out that the current tasks of the Bulgarian Communist Party are: to strengthen the Central Committee of the Party and establish collective working methods; to consolidate the Party, develop inner-Party democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and improve revolutionary vigilance; to organize and launch mass criticism by the broad masses of Party members; and to improve the theoretical level of Party cadres and the broad masses of Party members. Chervenkov particularly emphasized at the end the opposition to nationalism, strengthening of internationalism, strengthening, expanding, and cherishing Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, so that Bulgaria develops along the socialist road.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第二十八期出版
    【新华社二十三日讯】共产党与工人党情报局机关刊物“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第二十八期（总第六十七期）二十二日在此间出版。这一期重要内容是刊载了中苏两国关于中华人民共和国与苏联之间缔结条约与协定的公告、条约和协定的全文，并以显著地位刊登了苏联真理报社论“中苏友谊万岁！”。此外，本期还刊载了保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记契尔文科夫重要的论文“从破获特拉伊科·科斯托夫匪帮与消灭这一匪帮的斗争中得出的教训”。
    契尔文科夫的论文着重分析科斯托夫主义先前没有被破获的原因。他严肃地指出了保共工作中所存在的严重缺点。契尔文科夫在分析这些缺点时指出：保加利亚共产党长期普遍存在着一个糊涂观点，即保加利亚国家的发展有一种特殊的道路，保加利亚在一九四四年九月九日解放后的阶级斗争就会愈加减退，这个糊涂观点麻痹了人民的警惕性。正如季米特洛夫所指出过的：这是过低估计了在我们的条件下、在从资本主义过渡到社会主义的时期中，阶级斗争尖锐化的不可避免性；过低估计了反动派的力量；过低估计了工人阶级及一切劳动人民的力量、可能性与能力。此外，契尔文科夫指出：党的领导机构中央委员会及其执行与常设机构中的缺乏必要的集体工作制度；在中央委员会中严重存在着自由主义；无批判地相信旧有的专家，不去从工人阶级行列里提拔优秀的新干部到党与国家的领导机构中来，以及党内理论水平的低下等等，都使敌人有空隙可钻，有了活动的地盘。
    针对着上述缺点，契尔文科夫指出目前保共的任务是：加强党的中央委员会并确立集体工作方法；巩固党，发展党内民主，开展批评和自我批评，提高革命警惕性；组织与展开广大党员的群众性批评；提高党的干部和广大党员的理论水平。契尔文科夫于结尾时特别着重提出反对民族主义，加强国际主义，加强、扩大并且珍重保苏友谊，使保加利亚沿着社会主义的道路发展。
