Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd—The Central People's Government News Administration has issued a decision on improving newspaper work, the full text of which is as follows:

　　(1) To adapt to the situation where the country is gradually shifting to production and construction as the central task, newspapers nationwide should use the primary space to report on the people's production and labor conditions, publicize successful experiences and lessons learned in production work and economic and financial management, and discuss solutions to various difficulties encountered in these tasks. The news, communications, commentaries, mailboxes, specialized or general supplements of newspapers should all serve this task as much as possible. In areas where land reform work is underway, reports and discussions on land reform should also occupy a primary position.
　　Local newspapers should strive to meet the needs of the local people. In addition to the most important domestic and international events, general news dispatches can be summarized and interpreted in a popular way in provincial or sub-provincial local newspapers.
　　Whether it is a central, greater administrative region, or provincial-level newspaper, the amount of space devoted to meetings, organizational activities, and unimportant speeches and actions of responsible personnel, and unimportant announcements and telegrams should be reduced. For important meetings and announcements, efforts should be made to use appropriate news reports and commentaries to provide vivid and popular explanations so that they can be understood by the people.

　　(2) In order to strengthen the role of newspapers in the national construction cause, the editors, reporters, and commentators of newspapers must be proficient in the basic knowledge of social sciences, understand the policies, conditions, and problems of national and local construction undertakings, develop a realistic and truth-seeking work style, and strive to maintain close ties with the people, organizations, and cadres. The organizational form and working methods of newspaper offices should be reformed, and the existing state of affairs in which editing, interviewing, communication and liaison work are carried out independently and hindering contact with reality should be changed. A unified and centralized leadership of the editorial department should be established, and appropriate groupings should be implemented according to different aspects of social life (such as public and private industry and commerce and labor issues, agriculture and peasant issues, military and armed forces, ideological culture and education and publication, etc.), so that the editors and reporters in each group can acquire specialized knowledge about the relevant aspects, and integrate the work of editing and interviewing.

　　(3) Newspapers should regard the establishment and leadership of a correspondent network and reading groups as important political tasks.
　　The newspaper's correspondent network should be based on active elements among the people, and in addition to active elements among workers and peasants, it should also absorb active workers from government agencies and progressive intellectuals. The newspaper editorial department should regularly use methods such as correspondence and meetings to guide and encourage the work of correspondents, help them learn to write important, fair, and rapid reports, and write down the opinions of the masses and their own opinions on government work, production and construction undertakings, and other social life.
　　Reading groups should be regular and organized learners and propagandists of newspaper content. Reading groups should also report local conditions and public opinions to the newspaper. In order to encourage the activities of reading groups, newspapers should give appropriate preferential treatment in subscription conditions or other aspects.

　　(4) Newspapers should bear the responsibility of criticizing the shortcomings and mistakes in the work of government agencies and their staff, economic organizations and their staff. This criticism should be active, constructive, realistic, and well-intentioned. The newspaper's published criticisms should require the criticized to make appropriate statements in order to report the results of the criticism to the people.
　　Newspapers should pay great attention to publishing and answering readers' letters, especially letters with criticisms, suggestions, and inquiries about government work, economic construction undertakings, and other social life. The most important of these letters can be incorporated into the news section, and others can be incorporated into the supplements, as the main content of general newspaper supplements.

　　新闻总署发布关于改进报纸工作的决定
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府新闻总署发布关于改进报纸工作的决定，全文如下：
    （一）适应全国逐步转入以生产建设为中心任务的情况，全国报纸应当用首要的篇幅来报道人民生产劳动的状况，宣传生产工作和经济财政管理工作中成功的经验和错误的教训，讨论解决这些工作中所遇到的各项困难的办法。报纸的新闻、通讯、评论、信箱、专门性的或一般性的副刊，都应当尽可能地服从于这个任务。在进行土地改革工作的地方，关于土地改革的报道和讨论也应当占据首要的地位。
    地方的报纸应当力求适应本地人民群众的需要。除了最重要的国内外大事，一般电讯在省级或省级以下地方报纸上可以采取摘要和加以通俗解释的方法。
    无论是中央的、大行政区的或省以下的报纸，都应当减少关于会议、机关活动、负责人员的不重要的言论行动，没有广泛重要性的文告文电的篇幅。对于重要的会议和文告应当力求用适当的新闻通信和评论加以生动而通俗的解释，以便为人民群众所了解。
    （二）为了加强报纸在国家建设事业中的作用，报纸的编辑、采访、评论人员必须通晓社会科学的基本知识，通晓国家和地方建设事业的政策、情况和问题，养成调查研究实事求是的作风，并力求与人民群众、机关和干部保持亲密的联系。应当改革报社的组织形式和工作方法，改变现有的妨碍联系实际的编辑采访通讯联络等项工作各自为政的状态，建立编辑部门统一集中的领导，并应按照社会生活的不同方面（例如公私营工商业与工人问题、农业与农民问题、军事与军队、思想文化与教育出版等）实行适当的分组，以便各组的编辑采访人员可以获得关于各该方面的专门知识，并将编辑采访的工作联合在一起。
    （三）报纸应当把建立和领导通讯员网和读报组的工作当作重要的政治任务。
    报纸的通讯员网应当以人民群众中的积极分子为主体，除工人农民中的积极分子外，也要吸收政府机关中的积极的工作人员和进步的知识分子参加。报纸编辑部应当经常地用通信和开会等方法去指导和鼓励通讯员的工作，帮助他们学习写出重要的、公正的和迅速的报道，并写出群众中的和他们自己的对于政府工作、生产建设事业和其他社会生活的意见。
    读报组应当是报纸内容的经常的和有组织的学习者和宣传者。读报组同时应当向报纸报告地方情况和群众意见。报纸为了鼓励读报组的活动，应当在订阅条件或其他方面给以适当的优待。
    （四）报纸对于政府机关及其工作人员、经济组织及其工作人员的工作中的缺点和错误，应负批评的责任。这种批评应当是积极的，富于建设性的，实事求是的，和与人为善的。报纸所发表的批评应当要求被批评者作适当的声明，以便向人民群众报告批评的结果。
    报纸应当用很大的注意来发表和答复读者的来信，特别是关于政府工作、经济建设事业和其他社会生活的批评、建议和询问的信件。这些信件中最重要的可以编入新闻版，其他的可以编入副刊，作为一般报纸副刊的主要内容。
