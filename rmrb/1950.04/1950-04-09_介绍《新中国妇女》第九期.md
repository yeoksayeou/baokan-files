Introducing the Ninth Issue of "New Chinese Women"
    Hong Ye
    "Learn skills and do a good job" is the new requirement that the current situation and new tasks put forward to all female cadres in China. The ninth issue of "New Chinese Women" focuses on how to learn skills and do a good job.
    In order to cooperate with the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's notice published in the People's Daily on March 13, calling on all female cadres to study the Xinhua News Agency's March 8 editorial "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job," this issue of the journal has specially selected several articles from newspapers and individuals on the current women's work and ideological issues, including: "Deng Yingchao's Speech at the Capital's 'March 8th' Commemoration Meeting," Shuai Guang's "Eliminating Feudal Ideas to Improve Ourselves," the North China People's Liberation Army newspaper editorial "Strengthening Women's Work in the Army," the Dalian People's Daily editorial "Attaching Importance to Women's Work and Improving Women's Work," the Pingyuan Daily editorial "Mobilizing and Organizing Women to Participate in the Great Production Movement," as well as the People's Daily editorial "Correctly Resolving the Issue of the Marriage System" and a news report entitled "Laboring Women in Old Liberated Areas Urgently Demand Freedom of Marriage."
    Comrade Shuai Guang's article, after listing, analyzing, and criticizing several feudal ideas remaining in the minds of some male and female comrades in the army, puts forward four ways to overcome these feudal ideas, the most important of which is for female comrades to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so as to eliminate these feudal ideas and do their work well. The North China People's Liberation Army newspaper editorial summarizes the important role and work achievements of women in the army, and if women's work in the army is to be done better in the future, the first step is for the leading organs to attach importance to women's work and cultivate female comrades to participate in general work and even leadership work. If the marriage system issue is to be correctly resolved, it must be done in accordance with the two principles pointed out in the People's Daily editorial "Correctly Resolving the Issue of the Marriage System": one is that the Central People's Government formulates and promulgates a marriage law guaranteeing freedom of marriage. The other is to conduct ideological education against the feudal marriage system in rural areas, especially among rural cadres and party members.
    In addition, the article "Organizational Forms and Mobilization Experience of Women's Participation in Agricultural Production in Shanxi Province in 1949" provides us with good reference materials for organizing and mobilizing rural women to participate in agricultural production. Yu Ying's "An Account of What I Saw and Heard in Disaster Areas" explains how the Party, government, and various mass organizations in disaster areas organize and mobilize women to overcome the natural disasters brought to the people together with men, which is an urgent task at hand and must be done well in accordance with the principle of "economizing to overcome disasters and relying on production for self-relief," breaking the purely relief-based perspective and concentrating efforts on this work. The article "How the Dalian Textile Factory Eliminates Illiteracy" proves that eliminating illiteracy among workers is not a difficult task. As long as everyone can be mobilized and everyone can come up with ideas and solutions, good results will be achieved. The article "The Work of Trade Union Dependents at the Tianjin No. 6 Textile Factory" tells us that organizing trade union dependents to study and work is not only beneficial to them but also beneficial to production.

　　介绍《新中国妇女》第九期
    红叶
    “学会本领做好工作”，是目前新的形势与新的任务向全中国所有女干部提出的新要求。《新中国妇女》第九期就是以如何学会本领做好工作，为中心的。
    为了配合中华全国民主妇女联合会在三月十三日人民日报发布给全体女干部学习三月八日新华社社论《学会本领做好工作》的通告，该刊本期特意选辑了几个报纸与个人有关目前妇女工作及思想问题的文章，计有：《邓颖超在首都“三八”纪念会上的讲话》，帅光的《肃清封建思想才能提高自己》，华北解放军报社论《加强部队妇女工作》，旅大人民日报社论《重视妇女工作提高妇女工作》，平原日报社论《发动与组织妇女参加大生产运动》，以及人民日报社论《正确解决婚姻制度问题》与《老解放区劳动妇女迫切要求婚姻自由》一新闻报导。
    帅光同志的文章，在列举并分析、批判了在军队中一些男女同志的脑子里所残存着的几种封建意识后，针对这几种封建意识提出了四种克服的办法，其中最主要的就是要女同志努力学习马列主义毛泽东思想，借此扫除这些封建意识，把工作做好。华北解放军报社论，总结了妇女在军队里所起的重大作用及工作成就，而今后军队中的妇女工作要想做得更好，首先从领导机关重视妇女工作，培养女同志参加一般工作乃至领导工作。要想把婚姻制度问题得到正确解决，则必须按照人民日报《正确解决婚姻制度问题》的社论中所指出的两条原则：一是中央人民政府制定并颁布保障婚姻自由的婚姻法。另一个是在农村中特别是农村干部与党员中进行反封建婚姻制度的思想教育。
    此外，“山西省一九四九年妇女参加农业生产的组织形式及动员经验”一文，给我们提供了在组织与发动农村妇女参加农业生产时很好的参考材料。育英写的《灾区见闻记》，说明了受灾区的党、政及各种群众团体如何把妇女组织与发动起来，同男人一起渡过自然给人民带来的灾害是眼前的一个急迫任务，必须依照“节约渡灾，生产自救”的原则，打破单纯的救济观点，集中力量把这一工作作好。“大连纺织厂是如何消灭文盲的”一文，证明消灭工人中的文盲并不是一件难事，只要能把大家发动起来，让大家出主意想办法，就会得到很好的收效。“天津中纺六厂的工属工作”一文，告诉了我们把工属组织起来进行学习和工作，不但对她们有利，并且对生产也是有利的。
