　(I) How Soviet Trade Unions Operate

　　The Soviet trade union is the most powerful mass organization in the Soviet Union and the largest working-class organization in the world. The Soviet trade union has 28.5 million members, consists of 191 trade unions, and unites more than 85% of workers and staff.

　　In its actual activities, the Soviet trade union is the most powerful assistant of the vanguard of its class—the Bolshevik Party; it is an educational, guiding, and training organization, a managerial, operational, and communist school, as Lenin pointed out; it is also a gear belt of a machine, as Stalin said, which helps the Party and the working class to establish contact.

　　In its activities, the Soviet trade union closely connects with the masses and attracts the broad masses of working people to participate in national construction. The trade union regularly discusses the daily life problems of the masses, and trade union members regularly attend all work meetings and production meetings of enterprises and workshops. The trade union promptly explains to the working masses the specific tasks put forward by the Party and the government to the people, leads the masses to discuss collective contracts, cultivates the working class's sense of responsibility for production and sense of ownership of the country, fosters a communist attitude towards labor, leads socialist competitions, promotes advanced production experiences, and improves the political, cultural, and technical level of the working masses.

　　The activities of the trade union have played a great role in socialist construction. According to statistics at the time of the 10th Congress of Soviet Trade Unions last year, more than 90% of workers, engineers, and staff have participated in socialist competitions; this year, when enterprises signed collective contracts, workers and staff have put forward one million suggestions for improving production; the ideas of Stakhanovite innovators, due to the promotion of the trade union, have penetrated into every department of the national economy and have achieved great results; the trade union has cultivated a large number of technical personnel and managed relations with the state, the masses, and society. During the Great Patriotic War of the former Soviet Union, the trade union organized and educated the masses, so that all activities supported the front lines and supported victory.

　　The Soviet trade union has greatly improved the living and cultural standards of the working class. The trade union manages the workers' national social insurance itself; supervises and implements the implementation of labor protection laws, safety regulations, and industrial hygiene; arranges workers' medical treatment and recuperation; expands housing and establishes schools, clubs, and other cultural networks.

　　The democratic nature of the Soviet trade union is reflected in elections, criticism and self-criticism, and close contact between leaders and members. The percentage of participation in elections is often very high when the trade union elects leading bodies.

　　The trade union has the right to participate in the elections of the Soviet regime and nominate its own candidates. In the election campaign, trade union members are the most active propagandists and organizers.

　　The Soviet trade union is continuously carrying out international activities. When the World Federation of Trade Unions was established in 1945, the participation of the Soviet trade union played a leading role. Now, the Soviet trade union is working hard to strengthen the unity of international workers and fight for peace, democracy, and socialism. [Xinhua News Agency]

　(II) Trade Union Activities in Czechoslovakia

　　The Czechoslovak trade union now has 3 million members, accounting for about one-quarter of the country's population. Before the war, Czechoslovakia was a highly industrialized country, with industrial production ranking seventh in the capitalist world. There were 1.1 million people working in large industries. However, due to the capitalists' division and suppression, the workers' organizations were split into twelve trade union centers, belonging to more than 600 small trade unions. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the great political unity of the working people was realized, and the influence and strength of the trade union gradually increased, and it became the main pillar of the people's democratic regime in action.

　　Before the Hitler gang was driven away, the organized Czechoslovak working class had heroically protected factories and transportation tools, preventing them from being destroyed by the Nazis. They organized volunteer teams, maintained transportation, assisted in harvesting, restored coal mines, and rebuilt factories. After the establishment of the people's democratic regime, they have exerted great strength more than once to consolidate the foundation of the democratic regime. In 1945, thanks to the sponsorship and support of the vast number of workers under the leadership of the trade union, the Czechoslovak government was able to smoothly implement the nationalization of large industries, banks, and insurance companies. In 1948, when the domestic reactionaries in Czechoslovakia colluded with foreign imperialists to plot to subvert the government and prepare for capitalist restoration, the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, took strong actions to crush the conspiracy of rebellion. After the February events, they devoted all their efforts to developing conscious labor discipline and engaging in production and construction. By the beginning of 1949, the level of industrial production in Czechoslovakia had exceeded the pre-war level of 1937 by 10%.

　　The trade union has played a significant role in training and organizing workers to implement economic plans. During the implementation of the two-year economic plan in 1947-48, the trade union trained more than 500,000 new skilled workers in a short period to meet the needs of industrial development. Workers also quickly learned to manage enterprises, such as the famous "Bata" shoe factory before the war, which achieved remarkable results under the new management.

　　After the implementation of the five-year plan beginning in 1949, the trade union vigorously organized a production competition campaign. In 1949, the number of factories participating in the production competition increased from 400 in 1948 to 2,000, and the number of shock teams increased rapidly from 1,100 in 1948 to 30,000. By October, the number of workers participating in the production competition reached 649,000. By the end of 1949, industrial output had increased by 13.6% compared with the pre-war period, and the actual wages of workers had exceeded the pre-war level by 40%.

　　The Second Congress of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, held in December 1949, coincided with the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Treaty. The meeting vividly demonstrated the highly developed internationalist spirit of the Czechoslovak proletariat. The delegates unanimously expressed that the workers of Czechoslovakia are loyal to the fighting program of the World Federation of Trade Unions, wholeheartedly build socialism, and strive for lasting peace in the world.

　　国际常识
  （一）苏联工会怎样进行活动
    苏联工会是苏联最强大的一个群众团体，也是世界上最大的一个工人阶级的团体。苏联工会拥有二千八百五十万会员，由一百九十一个工会组成，它团结了百分之八十五以上的工人和职员。
    苏联工会在实际活动中，是自己阶级的先锋队——布尔什维克党的最有力的助手；是列宁所指出的一个教育的、诱导的、训练的组织，一个管理的、经营的、共产主义的学校；也是斯大林所说的它是一根机器的轮带，它帮助党和工人阶级取得了联系。
    苏联工会在活动中密切联系了群众，吸引广大劳动群众参加了国家建设。工会经常讨论群众的日常生活问题，工会会员经常出席一切企业、车间的工作会议和生产会议。工会及时地向劳动群众说明党和政府向人民提出的具体任务，带动群众讨论集体合同，培养工人阶级对生产的责任感和对国家的主人翁感，培养共产主义的劳动态度，领导社会主义竞赛，推广先进的生产经验，提高劳动群众的政治、文化、技术水平。
    工会的活动在社会主义建设中起了伟大的作用。根据去年苏联工会第十届代表大会开会时的统计，参加社会主义竞赛的工人、工程师和职员，已达到百分之九十以上；今年，当各企业签订集体合同之时，工人和职员为改进生产已提出了一百万种建议；斯塔哈诺夫革新者的思想，由于工会的推广，已深入到国民经济的每个部门并已获得巨大成绩；工会已培养出大批技术人员与管理国家与群众与社会的关系，前苏联伟大的爱国战争时期，工会曾组织与教育了群众，使一切活动都支援了前线，支援了胜利。
    苏联工会曾以大力提高了工人阶级的生活与文化的水平。工会自行管理工人的国家社会保险；监督、执行劳动保护法、安全法规和工业卫生的实施；安排工人的医疗与休养；扩展住宅，建立学校、俱乐部等文化网。
    苏联工会的民主性质，表现在选举、批评与自我批评，以及领导者和会员之间的密切接触上。工会选举领导机关时，参加选举的百分比经常很高。
    工会有权参加苏维埃政权的选举，并提出自己的候选人。在选举运动中，工会会员是最活跃的宣传者与组织者。
    苏联工会不间断地进行着国际活动。一九四五年世界工联成立时，苏联工会的参加起了领导作用。现在，苏联工会正努力加强国际工人的团结，为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。【新华社】
  （二）捷克斯洛伐克工会活动
    捷克斯洛伐克工会现在拥有会员三百万人，约占全国人口的四分之一。战前，捷克本是一个高度工业化的国家，工业生产占资本主义世界的第七位。在大工业中从事工作的有一百一十万人。但是，由于资本家的分化压制，工人的组织分裂成为十二个工会中心，分属六百多个小工会。捷克解放之后，在共产党的领导下，实现了劳动人民的政治大团结，工会的影响和力量日渐增长，并在行动中成为人民民主政权的主要支柱。
    在希特勒匪帮被驱走之前，有组织的捷克工人阶级便已英勇地保护了工厂和运输工具，使免于纳粹队的他们组织了志愿队，维持运输，协助收割，恢复煤矿，重建工厂。人民民主政权建立之后，他们不止一次地发挥了伟大的力量，巩固了民主政权的基础。一九四五年，由于在职工会领导下的广大工人的赞助与支持，捷克政府得以顺利地实行了大工业、银行和保险公司的国有。一九四八年，捷克国内反动派勾结外国帝国主义者密谋颠覆政府，准备资本主义复辟之时，工人阶级在共产党领导下采取了强力行动，粉碎了叛变阴谋。二月事件之后，他们更献出一切力量，发展了自觉的劳动纪律，从事生产建设。到一九四九年初，捷克工业生产水平即已超过战前一九三七年水平的百分之十。
    工会在训练和组织工人为实行经济计划的工作中，起了重大的作用。在一九四七——四八年执行两年经济计划时，工会在短期间内训练了五十万以上的新的技术工人，以应工业发展的需要。工人也迅速学会了管理企业，例如战前闻名的“拔佳”鞋厂，在新的管理下成绩卓著。
    在一九四九年起开始实行五年计划后，工会更大力地组织了生产竞赛的运动。在一九四九年，参加生产竞赛的工厂，已由一九四八年的四百个增到两千个，突击小组已由一九四八年的一千一百个飞速增加到三万个。到十月间，参加生产竞赛的工人已达六十四万九千人。到一九四九年年底，工业产量已较战前增加了百分之十三·六，工人的实际工资已超过战前水平的百分之四十。
    一九四九年十二月召开的捷克斯洛伐克工会第二届代表大会，适在捷苏友好条约签订六周年之日举行。会议生动地表现出了捷克无产阶级高度发扬了的国际主义精神。与会代表一致表示：捷克斯洛伐克的工人忠于世界工联的战斗纲领，全力建设社会主义，争取全世界的持久和平。【新华社】
