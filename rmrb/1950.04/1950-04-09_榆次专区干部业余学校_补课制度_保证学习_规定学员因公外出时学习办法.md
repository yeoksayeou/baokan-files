　　Yuci Special District Cadre Spare-Time School
    “Make-Up Class System” Guarantees Learning
    Regulations for Cadres on Official Business
    [This newspaper reports] The in-service cadre cultural refresher school directly under the Yuci Special District of Shanxi Province started classes on the 3rd. A total of 123 students are participating in the study. In addition to establishing general regular systems, the school stipulates that no personal leave is allowed during the two-hour daily class time. When students are away on official business, the responsible cadres in their respective departments must provide proof to the spare-time school to apply for leave, and cancel the leave on time upon returning. During the student's absence, the school has a "make-up class system" in place. It stipulates that before the student departs, the spare-time school teachers designate specific lessons based on the teaching progress, and the student must continue to study according to the prescribed time while working outside. At the same time, the spare-time school issues letters of introduction to the students. After the student arrives at the work location, they will take the letter to the local spare-time cultural refresher school or request instruction from primary school teachers to ensure the completion of the study progress. If the student is away for more than ten days, they must submit a written report to the spare-time school every ten days, and report in detail on the study situation during the absence after returning to school. When a student transfers jobs, the spare-time school issues a transfer certificate to facilitate the student's continued study at the spare-time cultural refresher school at the new work location.
    [Also reporting] The in-service cadre cultural refresher schools directly under the counties of Shouyang, Pingyao, Taigu, Zuoquan, Heshun, Xiyang, and Yuci in this special district have all started in March. (Hao Jinrui, Qu Yuxiu, Wang Yun, Zhang Yaojie)
