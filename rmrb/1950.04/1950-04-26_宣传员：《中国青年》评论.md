　　Propagandist: Comment on "China Youth"
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League's organ, "China Youth," published a commentary entitled "Propagandist" in its thirty-sixth issue. The commentary states: The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League has established full-time propagandists to help the Youth League branches give lectures on the League's lessons in rotation in order to strengthen the League's education. This method is worth promoting.

    The commentary points out: Branch education work is still the weakest link in the current work of the Youth League. To give full play to the active role of the League branches, one of the central links is to strengthen the leadership and education of the branches. Therefore, the leading organizations of the Youth League at all levels must firmly grasp the branch education work and undertake the task of guiding and helping the branch education. First, the Provincial and Municipal Committees of the League should strive for all possible conditions to establish a system of full-time propagandists.

    Regarding the content of the propagandists' lectures, the commentary points out that, in addition to helping the League branches teach some basic knowledge about the League, it is also necessary to talk about the actual problems that occur in the League's central work, the youth's personal problems, and current affairs. The leaders of the League Committee should constantly help the propagandists improve their theoretical and professional level in their work, so that they can correctly and effectively help the League branches convey the Party's policies and the League's working principles, and can promptly reflect the problems found in the branches to the League's leading organizations.

　　宣传员：《中国青年》评论
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物《中国青年》第三十六期发表了一篇以《宣传员》为题的评论。评论说：青年团北京市工作委员会为了加强团的教育，设立专职宣传员，帮助团支部巡回讲授团课。这个办法是值得提倡的。
    评论指出：支部教育工作在目前还是青年团工作中最弱的一环。而要发挥团支部的积极作用，其中心环节之一，就在于加强支部的领导和教育。因此，各级团委的领导组织必须十分抓紧支部教育工作，担任起指导与帮助支部教育的任务。首先是团省委、市委应争取一切可能条件，建立专职宣传员制度。
    关于宣传员讲授的内容，评论指出在目前除了帮助团支部讲一些关于团的基本知识外，并须讲一些关于团在中心工作中所发生的实际问题、青年切身问题和时事问题。团委的领导人员要不断地帮助宣传员在工作中提高理论和业务水平，使他们能够正确地、有效地帮助团支部传达党的政策和团的工作方针，并能将支部中所发现的问题及时反映给团的领导组织。
