　　Yutian and Other Counties Complete Spring Wheat Sowing
    Disaster-stricken Refugees Return Home to Participate in Production
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] In the disaster areas of Fengrun, Yutian, and other counties in the Tangshan Special District of Hebei, agriculture is combined with sideline occupations to overcome the famine at the end of winter and the beginning of spring, and the sowing of early-maturing crops has been completed. After the distribution of large quantities of relief grain and the in-depth leadership of a large number of cadres, the disaster-stricken people in various places have carried out diverse spring sideline production and handicraft production. Seventy head of livestock are also maintained for spring plowing. The seed problem was first solved in various disaster areas, and the people were called upon to organize themselves, with people and livestock exchanging labor and helping each other. Men and women went to the fields to pull plows, drain water, and clear the land, fully entering into spring plowing and planting. The Tenth District of Fengnan carried out key leadership, established plow-sharing stations through people's representative conferences at all levels, regulated livestock power, and solved the problem of plowing for military families. In Zhao Maozhuang, with only eight livestock, the village cadres and party members took the lead, and 600 mu of spring wheat were sown early. In the Fifth District, 896 men, women, and children went to the fields to pull plows and rushed to plant 2,254 mu of wheat. More than 50,000 mu of spring wheat have been sown in the whole county. The Fifth and Sixth Districts of Luannan have rushed to plant 40,000 mu. The plan to sow 40,000 mu of spring wheat in Fengrun has been exceeded. Yutian mobilized the masses to drain water while rushing to plant. The original plan was to plant 110,000 mu of wheat, but now more than 120,000 mu have been planted. As of the 20th of last month, more than 270,000 mu of wheat had been planted in various disaster areas. In terms of sideline production, there has also been great development, such as spinning, weaving, mat weaving, weaving pockets, boiling saltpeter, transportation, fishing, shrimp catching, papermaking, and making thorny branches, etc. Among them, spinning and weaving and mat weaving are the most numerous. According to statistics from Yutian, Luannan, Fengnan, and Leting counties, there are now 22,539 looms in operation, accounting for more than two-thirds of all the looms in the four counties, and 43,383 spinning wheels are in operation. Thanks to the timely supply of raw materials and the promotion of products by the supply and marketing cooperatives, 95,132 jin of local yarn and 124,244 bolts of local cloth were collected from the masses in January and February, and the masses received 186,366 jin of millet. The mat weaving industry in Yutian County has also developed greatly. A month ago, there were only 852 households weaving mats in the Fifth, Tenth, and Eleventh Districts, but now it has increased to 2,129 households. The disaster-stricken people in Caishen Temple, Leting, organized 42 large carts for transportation, transporting salt from the coast to the north of the Beining Railway and kiln pillars from Luan County to the Kailuan Coal Mine. At the same time, the refugees who fled from the district have returned home to farm one after another. All 77 households and 319 people who moved from the Ninth District of Leting to the Third District of Changli have returned home. When they left, the local people showed a spirit of fraternity and took out more than 1,500 jin of grain to give to the returning disaster victims as a base. Li Jingyang, a disaster victim from Wangzhuangzi, said gratefully after receiving the grain: "If it weren't for the leadership of the people's government and the mutual assistance of brothers and folks from all over the country, the famine would not have been overcome. My ox is protected, and I will definitely engage in sideline occupations and cultivate the land well to repay everyone's kindness when I return home."
