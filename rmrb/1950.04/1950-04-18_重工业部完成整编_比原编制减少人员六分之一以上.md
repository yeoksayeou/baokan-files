　　Ministry of Heavy Industry Completes Reorganization
    Reducing Staff by More Than One-Sixth of Original Size

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government completed its organizational restructuring at the end of last month. The original planned staffing for the first half of this year was 698 people. After the reorganization, it is 578 people, a total reduction of 120 people (in addition to vacancies, the actual reduction includes 64 service staff and 30 cadres). Those reduced are generally administrative staff or those unsuitable for their assigned work. This reorganization was carried out in a democratic manner, mobilizing the masses from the bottom up, launching heated discussions, and combining it with in-depth inspections of the work. First, the existing organizational structure was reviewed, and overlapping functions were rationally merged. For example, the Managerial Affairs Department of the Ministry had an accounting section specifically for handling the accounting and statistics of various production outputs, but the Accounting Department also had an agency of the same nature. These were merged. This not only reduced cadres and overcame the cumbersome organizational structure, but also enabled work of the same nature to achieve unified and organic connections, thereby improving work efficiency. During the reorganization, in order to clearly define the scope of responsibilities of units at all levels, some units calculated the time required for each person's regular, temporary, and all work, discussed the nature of each person's work and the burden of responsibilities, and adopted a meticulous calculation method for reorganization. After such calculations, it was found that the average working hours per person per day did not reach eight hours, dispelling the illusion that some people were “busy.”
    In accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry adopted the principle of not dismissing redundant personnel. Some of the redundant personnel have already obtained suitable work, some have been introduced by the authorities to study at schools, and some are being planned for placement.

    At the beginning of this reorganization, the Ministry first established a Reorganization Review Committee and then established reorganization work groups in each department and office, actively promoting various preparatory work based on the intentions of higher authorities. Repeated research and discussions were conducted in advance, and a mobilization meeting was held for all cadres to conduct persuasion and education to dispel the ideological concerns of the cadres and staff. At the same time, mobilization was also carried out within the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union, which are all reasons why the Ministry was able to successfully complete the reorganization task.

　　重工业部完成整编
    比原编制减少人员六分之一以上
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部已于上月终完成了机构整编工作。该部今年上半年度原计划编制六百九十八人，整编后为五百七十八人，共减少一百二十人（除编制上的空额外，实际编余勤杂人员六十四人、干部三十人）。减少的人员，一般多系行政事务人员或不适于所任工作的人员。这次整编工作是采取民主方式。自下而上地发动群众，展开热烈的讨论，结合对工作的深入检查进行的。首先，检查了原有组织机构，将重叠的予以合理的合并。如该部经理司设有会计科，专一办理各种生产成品的核算和统计，但会计司内也有同样性质的机构，两者即进行合并。这样不仅减少了干部，克服了机构的庞杂现象，而且也使同样性质的工作能达到统一和有机的连系，这就可以提高工作效率。在进行整编时，该部为了明确规定上下级各单位的职责范围，有的单位通过了计算每人经常的、临时的以及所有工作所需的时间，讨论每人工作性质及负担轻重情况，采取了精打细算的方法进行整编。经这样计算后，算出了每人每天的工作平均都达不到八小时，打破了某些人空喊“忙”的现象。
    该部遵照政务院指示，对编余人员采取了不遣散的原则。编余人员中有的已获得适当的工作，有的由机关介绍到学校学习，有的正在筹划安插中。
    该部这次整编开始，首先成立了整编审查委员会；并在各司、室成立了整编工作小组，根据上级意图积极推动各项准备工作。事先反复研究讨论，并召开全体干部动员大会，进行说服教育，打破干部人员的思想顾虑。同时在党、团和工会内也分别进行动员，这些都是该部整编任务能顺利完成的原因。
