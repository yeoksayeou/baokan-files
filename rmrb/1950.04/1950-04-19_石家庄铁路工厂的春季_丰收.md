　　Spring "Harvest" at Shijiazhuang Railway Factory
　　Xiǎozhōu
　　(I)
　　On the afternoon of March 29th, the workers of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory of the Taiyuan Railway Administration sent off the last five black, oily freight cars amidst the swirling sand and dust. Tian Yunhua, the director of the vehicle department, wiped the dust off his face, strode into the office with a smile, picked up a stub of chalk and drew five white lines on the blackboard. Adding to the twenty-eight lines above, a total of thirty-three "resurrected" dead cars were completed this month.

　　According to the Ministry of Railways' first-quarter (January, February, March) production targets, the repair of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, as well as the supply of spare parts to other sections, were all overfulfilled.

　　(II)
　　According to the Ministry of Railways' regulations, the number of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars to be repaired by the factory this year should increase by an average of 19.3 percent, 63.6 percent, and 124.3 percent respectively, compared to last year. Therefore, based on the factory's current workforce of 1,177 people, at least 16.5 percent more personnel would be needed to meet this requirement. However, given the country's financial difficulties, the factory only increased its manpower by 9.6 percent, and more than two-thirds of these were apprentices and unskilled workers. "Few people, heavy tasks" was the first difficulty encountered at the beginning of the work.

　　At the same time, the factory's on-site equipment was relatively poor, with very few highly efficient machine tools. If a breakdown occurred during use, requiring the machine to be stopped for repair, it would inevitably affect the completion of production tasks. Therefore, although the production targets set by the ministry were discussed and established by the workers, and the workers' enthusiasm was high, this problem remained a concern in their minds.

　　The number of spare parts currently in stock within the factory was extremely small, with a particular shortage of axles and driving wheels, which were essential for repairing cars. The supply of many materials would be a major difficulty. This quarter had fewer working days than the other three quarters, with a total of only seventy-three working days, excluding Sundays and Spring Festival holidays. In terms of personnel, machinery, materials, and time, it was indeed very difficult to complete the production tasks for this quarter. However, the factory's 1,280 workers and leaders at all levels overcame these difficulties, achieved the glorious performance of exceeding the ministry's targets, and were praised by Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways in a "telephone conference" on April 2nd, and he called on other railway factories to learn from the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory!

　　(III)
　　"An experienced stoker knows where to swing the hammer!" The factory's old hero, Ji Gensheng, used this sentence to summarize how they overcame the difficulties.

　　To solve the difficulty of insufficient materials, the factory first made a detailed analysis: what cars to work on when there were materials, and what to use as substitutes when there was a shortage of materials. Naturally, it was impossible in the existing circumstances to plan for every working day to have sufficient materials. The difficulty told everyone to "find materials when there were no materials!" Therefore, in this quarter, the workers utilized a total of 1,573 pieces of old materials and spare parts that they tried their best to make themselves. Forged products were used to replace cast steel parts, and waste coiled spring material was used to make springs, totaling 23,557 kilograms. Among them, the use of old car wheels and axles pieced together to replace locomotive driving wheels accounted for three pairs, and vehicle wheels accounted for one hundred and twenty-seven pairs. This played the greatest role in overcoming the material difficulties in overfulfilling the task.

　　"The materials are old, but as long as the effort is there, the problem can still be solved." Take the number of test runs as an example: in the fourth quarter of last year, the average number of locomotive test runs was 3.08 times, passenger cars 1.17 times, and freight cars 1.23 times. In this quarter, the number of test runs for the three types of cars was reduced to 1.75 times, 1.14 times, and 1.06 times respectively. This shows that although many old materials were used in the repaired cars, the quality actually improved.

　　With fewer test runs, the rework (returning work) for parts on cars re-entering the factory was also generally reduced. Among them, locomotives and freight cars were reduced by nearly one-third on average compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and passenger cars were also reduced by more than one-tenth.

　　As for the shortage of manpower and on-site equipment, the factory adjusted manpower appropriately according to the machine tool efficiency of the factory's ten production departments, generally starting three shifts of work and implementing a "machines don't rest" approach. The foundry shop opened two shifts; the day shift made models, and the night shift melted iron, improving the quality of castings. The cylinder boring machine was not sufficient, so the factory manufactured one itself, solving the difficulty. With the assistance of technicians from the engineering section, the tool shop imitated and produced long ceiling taps, and repaired the wheel machine rocker, which had not been used for many years, which made the efficiency of labor, machines, and tools gradually approach the required level. These were the basic guarantees for overfulfilling the ministry's set tasks.

　　(IV)
　　The factory learned from the advanced experience of the Northeast and improved the meeting system and production management system of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League. The chaotic phenomenon of the department in charge of repair directly urging the assisting department was resolved by the engineering section establishing a central warehouse. In order to further find out the standard man-hours for products, a small-ticket work recording system was initially established through democratic discussions among the workers. In order to ensure that the finished products met specifications and reduce waste, an inspection and audit section was established to specifically inspect the cars and spare parts leaving the factory. These measures, combined with the workers' enthusiasm for overcoming difficulties, not only steadily improved production in terms of quantity and quality, but also gradually put the work on a regular track.

　　In terms of overtime and voluntary labor, there were a total of 3,223 overtime hours in the fourth quarter of last year, but this quarter it was sharply reduced to 766 hours, and voluntary labor was also reduced from 2,028 to 1,027 hours. The absenteeism rate (including marriage, funeral, sick leave, and absenteeism, study, meetings, etc.) was 3.42 percent. These reduced a large expenditure for the factory, and the number of accidents and malfunctions this quarter was also reduced by more than 40 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

　　Here, it must be mentioned how the workers fought against accidents.

　　In the past, in addition to the administrative management system for cars entering the factory for repair, there was no one specifically responsible for the cars, which caused many unnecessary losses during the construction process, and it was difficult to grasp the procedures, which caused a lot of rework. After this accident prevention method was discussed, a regulation of personal responsibility was established. When a car entered the factory, a nameplate of the person in charge was hung on it, and no one could touch it without his permission. After the vehicle department repaired the axles, a marking system was established, and whoever made it would put a mark on it. These two methods not only improved the quality of the repaired cars and prevented the procedures from being disordered, but also played a considerable role in eliminating accidents. The number of days the repaired car spent in the factory was also relatively reduced. Taking locomotives and passenger cars as examples, broken and resurrected cars took an average of 36.6 days in the fourth quarter of last year, but this quarter it was reduced to 20 days; the resurrection of dead passenger cars was particularly significant, dropping sharply from 43.5 days to 18 days. The shortening of the repair time in the factory can greatly increase the value of operation. Taking a passenger car as an example, an average of 1,250 catties of millet can be added to the income per day of operation.

　　(V)
　　At the beginning of this month, at the factory's workers' representative meeting, the representatives enthusiastically passed the proposal to report production to Chairman Mao. They believed that future production, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, would continue to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and the Northeast, and would achieve more harvests and win greater victories.

　　石家庄铁路工厂的春季“丰收”
    晓洲
    （一）
    三月二十九日下午，太原铁路管理局石家庄铁路工厂的工友们，在漫天的风沙里送去了最后五辆黑油油的货车。车辆所主任田蕴华擦擦脸上的尘土，满脸笑容跨进了办公室，拿起半截粉笔在黑板了画了五条白道，加上上面二十八条，这月里，总共了三十三辆复活死车。
    按照铁道部规定的第一季（一、二、三月）生产任务，不论是机、客、货车的检修或供给外段的备品，全都超额完成了。
    （二）
    根据铁道部的规定，该厂今年检修机、客、货车的数量，比去年平均各增加百分之十九点三；百分之六十三点六和百分之一百二十四点三。因此，按照该厂现有一千一百七十七个劳动力的情况，至少要加添百分之十六点五才能适应这个任务的要求，但在国家财政困难情形下，该厂只增加了百分之九点六的人力，且其中三分之二以上是学徒和杂工。“人力少，任务重”，这就是工作开展初期的第一件困难。
    同时，机厂的现场设备比较差，效率高的工作母机数量很少。在使用中如果发生故障，须要停车修理时，就必然会影响生产任务的完成。所以部定生产任务虽经工友们讨论订立了，工友们的情绪也很高，但这个问题在工友们的心里始终是一个问题。
    厂内现存备品为数极少，检修车必不可少的车轴和动轮尤其缺乏，许多材料的供应将是一个很大的困难。这一季的工作日比其他三季都少，除去星期日和春节休假，总共只有七十三个工作日。从人员、机器、材料和时间来看，要完成这季生产任务的确是十分困难的，但机厂一千二百八十名工友和各级领导干部，却战胜了这些困难，取得了超过完成部定任务的光荣业绩，得到铁道部滕代远部长在四月二日“电话会议”上的表扬，并号召其他铁路工厂向石家庄铁路工厂学习！
    （三）
    “红炉的老把式，知道榔头该甩在啥地界”！机厂老英雄计根生用这一句话来概括他们怎样战胜了困难。
    为解决材料不足的困难，厂部首先作了详尽的分析，有材料时作啥车，缺料又用啥来代替。自然，要计划得每一工作日都能材丰料足，在现有情况下是不可能的。困难告诉大伙“没料找料”！因此在这一季中，工友们利用的旧料和尽量设法自做的备品，共计一千五百七十三件。锻制品代替铸钢件和废圆簧料代作弹簧共达两万三千五百五十七公斤。其中以旧车轮车轴拼凑成对来代用的机车动轮就有三对，车辆一百二十七对，这在超额完成任务中，克服材料困难所起的作用最大。
    “料是旧的，只要功夫到了，也还是能解决问题。”就拿试车次数来比较，去年第四季机车试车平均三点零八次，客车一点一七次，货车一点二三次。这一季中三种车的试车即分别减低到一点七五次、一点一四次和一点零六次。这说明了检修车虽然用了不少旧料，但质量却反而提高了。
    试车次数减少，再入厂车的回修配件（反手活）也就普遍减低。其中机、货车比去年第四季平均减低将近三分之一，客车也减少十分之一以上。
    至于人力和现场设备不足，厂部按照全厂十个生产所的机器工具效能，适当地调整人力，一般开动三班工作，实行歇人不歇马的办法。铸工所则开双班；白班作模型、夜班化铁，提高了铸品的质量。镟缸机不够使唤，厂里自己仿制了一部，解决了困难。在工务课技术员的协助下，工具所仿制出天井长丝锥，并修复了多年不用的车轮机摇搞，这就使得劳动力和机器、工具效能逐渐接近应有的效率。这些就是超额完成部定任务的基本保证。
    （四）
    厂部学习东北先进经验，改进了党、政、工、团的会议制度和生产管理制度，以前由主办场所开检修车直催协助所的紊乱现象，由工务科设立中心仓库来解决。为了进一步找出制品的标准工时，通过工友们的民主讨论，初步建立起小票记工制；并为保证成品的合于规格和减少浪费，又建立起检审科来专门从事出厂车与备品的检查。这些措施结合工友战胜困难的热情，不仅使生产在数质量上稳步提高，并从而使工作逐渐走入正规。
    以加班和义务工来说，去年第四季中共有三千二百二十三个加工，但这一季锐减到七百六十六个，义务工也从二千零二十八减至一千零二十七；欠勤比率（包括婚、丧、病假和旷工、学习、开会等时间）为百分之三点四二。这些，就使得工厂的经费减少一笔较大的开支，而这一季的责任事故和故障，也比去年第四季减少百分之四十以上。
    这里，必须提到工友们是怎样和事故作斗争的。
    过去，检修车入厂除行政上的管理制度外，车没专人负责，施工过程中，造成很多不应有的损失，而工序的掌握也就发生了困难，反手活大多是这样造成的。经过这次反事故办法的研讨，订出专人负责的条例。当一辆车入厂，就挂上某人负责的名牌，不经他许可谁也不能动。车辆所检修车轴后建立起打印记制，谁做的谁打上记号。这两种作法不仅使检修车的质量提高，工序不致紊乱，对责任事故的消灭起了相当大的作用。检修车在厂日数也因之相对的缩减了，以机、客车为例，破损复活车去年第四季平均须用三十六点六天，这一季即减低到二十天；客车死复尤其显著，从四十三点五天锐减到十八天。检修车在厂日的缩短，所能增加的运转价值是非常大的，即以一辆客车计算，一天运转平均可以增加一千二百五十斤小米的收入。
    （五）
    本月初，该厂职工代表会上，代表们热烈地通过了上书毛主席报告生产的提案。他们相信：今后的生产，在毛主席的领导下，不断学习苏联和东北的经验，将会取得更多的收获和赢得更大的胜利。
