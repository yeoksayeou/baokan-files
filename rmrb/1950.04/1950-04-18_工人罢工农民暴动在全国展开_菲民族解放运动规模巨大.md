　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 17th: The Red Star commentator pointed out: The national liberation struggle in the Philippine Islands, which are virtually a U.S. colony, is becoming increasingly tense. The broad masses of working people, who are oppressed by both U.S. colonialists and the domestic bourgeoisie and feudal landlords, are participating in this struggle. Of the nineteen million Filipinos, more than three million are unemployed. The Filipino people, plundered by American bandits, are no longer satisfied with the false "independence" bestowed upon them by Washington swindlers. The new upsurge of the Philippine national liberation movement proves the increasing awakening of national consciousness among broad sections of the Filipino people.

　　The commentator continued: The workers' struggle for work and bread has converged with the peasant mass movement to confiscate landlords' land and implement democratic reforms, especially land reform. Peasant uprisings and workers' strikes and rallies against the policies of the Quirino puppet government and for the freedom and independence of the motherland have taken place throughout the country.

　　The activities of the People's Liberation Army, which has the support of the entire people, have expanded throughout the Philippines. Guerrillas have defeated the enemy in many battles, liberated several large settlements, and launched several raids on the outskirts of Manila.

　　The Philippine Army hastily expanded by 10,000 soldiers and, equipped with American weapons, has engaged in battles against the guerrillas. The United States is also helping their lackeys to carry out this bloody business with weapons and "advisors." Not long ago, the United States handed over twenty-six Thunderbolt aircraft and fifty Mustang aircraft to the Philippines.

　　The commentator stated: Philippine "suppression" troops, equipped with American tanks and aircraft, are carrying out brutal repression against Filipino patriots, but the mass character and scale of the Philippine people's liberation movement are expanding day by day.

　　工人罢工农民暴动在全国展开
    菲民族解放运动规模巨大
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：红星报评论员指出：实际上是美国殖民地的菲律宾群岛上的民族解放斗争，愈来愈紧张。受美国殖民者与本国资产阶级及封建地主双重压迫的劳动人民大众，都参加了这个斗争。一千九百万菲律宾人民中失业的已达三百万以上。被美国强盗们所劫掠的菲律宾人民，已经不再满意于华盛顿骗子们所赐给他们的虚伪的“独立”。菲律宾民族解放运动的新高涨，证明了菲律宾人民广大阶层民族意识觉醒的增涨。
    评论员继指出：要求工作与面包的工人斗争，与没收地主土地、实行民主改革、特别是土地改革的农民群众运动，已汇合起来。农民的暴动及反对季里诺傀儡政府的政策、并为争取祖国自由与独立的工人的罢工与集会等，已在全国各地发生。
    获得国内全体人民支持的人民解放军的活动，已扩及全菲律宾各地。游击队在许多战斗中击溃了敌人，解放了若干大居民点，并向马尼拉近郊发动了若干次突袭。
    菲陆军仓促扩充了一万名士兵，在美国武器的装备下，投入了对游击队的战斗。美国并以武器和“顾问”，帮助他们的走卒来进行这种血腥的勾当。不久以前，美国把二十六架雷霆式飞机及五十架野马式飞机交给了菲律宾。
    评论员称：装备着美国坦克和飞机的菲律宾“讨伐”部队，正在对菲律宾爱国分子进行残酷的镇压，但菲律宾人民解放运动的群众性和规模，却在日益扩大。
