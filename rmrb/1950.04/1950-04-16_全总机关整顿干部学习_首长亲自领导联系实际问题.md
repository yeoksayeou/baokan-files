　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Organizes Cadre Rectification Study
    Leading Officials Personally Lead and Connect with Practical Problems
    [This newspaper report] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU)机关 [agency] readjusted the study organization of its cadres in January of this year, and study has been initially established over the past two months. Since August of last year, the federation's cadres have been studying in groups, with Group C (cultural studies) achieving better results. This group has full-time teachers, and in half a year, some comrades learned 600 characters, while others can already read the Workers' Daily. There has also been progress in work and thinking. However, the study of Group A cadres has been relatively lax; Group B cadres are enthusiastic about studying but lack leadership. In January of this year, the federation transferred a group of new cadres from the Revolutionary University (革大), who had already studied the history of social development. The federation then reorganized cadre studies at this time. First, it strengthened study leadership, with the CCP branch as the core. The administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League jointly organized the General Study Committee (总学委会) to centrally lead the study. Based on the cadres' political and cultural levels, as well as their personal interests and different duties, the study organization was reorganized. The study content is divided into several types: (1) Theoretical study: Centered on political economy, for middle-level cadres and young cadres with higher cultural levels and some experience in struggle. A very small number of people study the history of social development. (2) Cultural study: For comrades with low cultural levels, focusing on Chinese language and arithmetic initially, with plans to add history, geography, or science later. (3) Russian class: Classes are divided into four based on existing proficiency. (4) Political class: Mainly for new party members and League members, but it has become a mass study activity, with the auditorium packed every time a class is held.
    The theoretical class study adopts a system of leaders taking responsibility combined with mass supervision. They are organized according to administrative departments, with responsible cadres personally leading the study, overcoming the lack of leadership in past studies. The Study Committee also proposed creating a mass study movement where everyone can discover problems together and answer them together. Comrades with lower theoretical levels can accelerate their progress with the help and mutual assistance of everyone; comrades with higher theoretical levels must first thoroughly understand the subject when helping everyone solve problems, and if they do not understand, they must consult reference books and seek advice from teachers, which also improves themselves. The results of this grouping method are very good. For example, when the editing and publishing office started studying political economy, many comrades felt it was difficult, but with the help of responsible cadres, they were able to proceed normally. In addition, departments such as the International Liaison Department, Administrative Office, Finance Department, Women Workers' Department, and Labor Insurance Department are all doing very well, and both new and old cadres are satisfied. However, leaders of a few units have not actively taken responsibility. Young comrades have no leadership in their studies and are now progressing more slowly.
    During the study, some cadres' incorrect attitudes toward study were corrected, so that everyone could ideologically recognize the importance of study. For example, some cadres believed that "work is busy, and there is no time for study," while others thought that "if work is not completed, they will be criticized, but it doesn't matter if study is delayed a bit." Therefore, study time was often used for office work, and when work was not busy, they rarely talked about study. Still other cadres said, "Their cultural level is low, and they are not suitable for working in leading organs, and they want to return to the factory," and they did not actively study to improve themselves. After the federation's Vice Chairman Li Lisan, Minister of Culture and Education Liu Ziju, and others gave instructions and reports, these ideas have generally been corrected. The cadres' enthusiasm for study has increased, and they are at ease with their work.
    During the study process, many groups made the mistake of mechanically memorizing terms and definitions. For example, when someone asked what "commodity fetishism" meant, everyone studied what is a commodity, what is fetishism, and what is religion. They even came up with some inexplicable explanations. However, some groups can discuss it in connection with reality and their own work. For example, when studying the law of value and the blindness of commodity production, the production cooperative cited the example of the abnormal development of the soap industry in Beijing shortly after liberation, which led to overproduction, causing some soap factories to shut down. Through these discussions and studies, everyone felt the importance of theoretical study. In the political class explanation, attention was paid to connecting it with the problems existing in the current thinking of cadres (such as some people not being at ease with their work; the relationship between love and work, etc.), so this study had the most people voluntarily attending.
    In addition, the theoretical study group of the Department of Culture and Education also tried a method of oral testing to expose and solve some problems that seemed to be understood but were not. After each chapter was studied, after full preparation, each comrade drew lots to answer the review questions at the end of the book one by one. The answers were given orally, and other comrades could raise counter-questions until they could no longer answer, and then other comrades would supplement or correct the answers. Different opinions could be debated until the problem was solved. This did not take a long time (one morning, thirteen people were tested), and it also promoted everyone's review, and problems could be truly solved after the test.

### 全总机关整顿干部学习  首长亲自领导联系实际问题

　　全总机关整顿干部学习
    首长亲自领导联系实际问题
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会机关在职干部，于今年一月起重新调整了学习组织，两个多月来，学习已初步就绪。该会干部自去年八月起分组进行学习，以丙组（文化学习）成绩较好。该组设有专任教员，在半年中有的同志学了六百字，有的已能读工人日报。工作上、思想上也有进步。但甲组干部的学习比较松懈；乙组干部学习热情高而缺乏领导。今年一月，该会由革大调来了一批新干部，他们已经学过了社会发展史。该会乃于此时整顿了干部学习。首先加强学习领导，以中共支部为核心，动员行政、工会、青年团共同组织总学委会，集中领导学习，并根据干部的政治、文化水平，以及个人爱好与业务的不同，重新调整了学习组织。学习内容分为多种：（一）理论学习：以政治经济学为中心，凡中级干部及文化水平较高、有些斗争经验的青年干部均参加。另有极少数人学习社会发展史。（二）文化学习：文化水平低的同志参加，开始时以国文、算术为主，准备再增加史地或理化。（三）俄文班：根据原有基础，分四班上课。（四）政治课：主要对象是新党员与团员，但已变为群众性的学习，每次上课均挤满了礼堂。
    理论班的学习，采取了首长负责制与群众性的监督相结合的形式。按行政部门编组，由负责干部亲自领导学习，克服过去学习中缺乏领导的现象。学委会并提出造成群众性的学习运动，大家共同发现问题，共同解答问题。理论水平较低的同志，在大家的启发互助下可以加速进步；理论水平较高的同志，则在帮助大家解决问题时，自己必须首先求得透彻的了解，不懂的还须看参考书，找老师请教，这样也提高了自己。此种编组方法，试验的结果很好。如编辑出版室开始学习政治经济学时，有许多同志感到困难，在负责干部的帮助下，已能正常进行。此外，如国际连络部、行政处、财务处、女工部、劳保部等都进行得很好，新老干部都感到满意。但有少数单位领导干部没有积极负起责任。青年同志在学习中没有领导，现在进度较慢。
    学习中，曾纠正一部分干部不正确的学习态度，使大家从思想上认识学习的重要。如有的干部认为“工作忙，挤不出时间学习”，有的则以为“工作完不成要受批评，学习耽误点没关系”，因此，学习时间经常去办公，而工作不忙时很少谈学习。又有一部分干部说：“自己文化水平低，不适宜在领导机关工作，要回到工厂去”，而不积极学习来提高自己。这些思想，自该会李立三副主席，文教部长刘子久等分别作了指示报告之后，一般已获纠正。干部的学习情绪高涨起来，工作也安心了。
    学习过程中，许多组曾犯了死啃名词、背定义的毛病。如有人提出什么叫“商品拜物教”，大家便研究何谓商品，何谓拜物，何谓教。甚至作出一些莫名其妙的解释。但有的组能联系实际与自己的业务来讨论。如学到价值规律与商品生产的盲目性时，生产社即举出北京刚解放以后肥皂业的畸形发展，以致造成生产过剩，一部分制皂厂停工的例子。通过这些讨论研究，大家都感到理论学习的重要。在政治课解讲中，注意了联系当前干部思想中存在的问题（如一部分人工作不安心；恋爱与工作的关系等），所以这一项学习自愿去听的人最多。
    此外，文教部理论学习小组还试用了一种口头测验的办法，以暴露一些似懂非懂的问题，予以解决。每章学习完后，经过充分准备，各同志逐一以抓阄的方式抽答书后的复习题。以口头方式作答，其他同志可提出反问，直到不能解答时，再由其他同志补充或修正。有不同的意见可以争论，直到问题解决为止。这样作并不需很长的时间（一早晨曾进行十三人），而且促进了大家的复习，测验后也能真正解决问题。
