　　Erlong Mountain Has Changed!
    Liu Chunmao, Shi Zhong
    The name Erlong Mountain is already familiar to many people in western Liaoning. It is one of the key areas where the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has provided loans for new agricultural implements—complete sets of Soviet animal-drawn machinery. Furthermore, at the provincial labor model conference, their representative, Qi Baoen, won the first-class red flag for "Model Mutual Aid Team" with the "group-based joint large group." What exactly is this "new countryside"—Erlong Mountain—located on the meadow near the vast desert?
  (I) A Landlord Forest
    The dozen or so households in Erlong Mountain used to be impoverished tenant farmers who relied on heavy manual labor and rented land for farming, except for two relatively well-off large tenant farmer families. The nearby land and houses all belonged to "Commander Ding" (a warlord under Zhang Zuolin), who leased them to a middle peasant, who then sublet the land he couldn't cultivate himself to poor farmers. Every year, after the harvest, "Commander Ding's" housekeeper would arrive in Erlong Mountain with several large mule-drawn carts, flaunting his power, enjoying the fine wine and opium prepared for him by the large tenant farmers. With a flick of his whip, the fruits of the year's labor of the people of Erlong Mountain would be plundered. The laborers stood silently by the roadside, watching the grain carts moving further and further away, unable to help but think of their wives sitting on the kang because they had no pants to wear and couldn't get off the kang, and that group of children with their mouths open, waiting for food...
    The hardships of the poor in Erlong Mountain were endless! Children not yet ten years old had to herd cattle for the landlords. In the dead of winter, they had no shoes to wear and had to stick their feet into cow dung to keep them warm. Families of seven or eight people were crammed into a small, dilapidated house rented for several dan of grain. Although they lived in such squalor, they still faced the threat of eviction, and the rent increased every year.
    For hundreds of years, Erlong Mountain did not know how many suffering people were born, nor how many suffering people died.
  (II) New Countryside
    Erlong Mountain has indeed changed!
    As soon as you enter the village gate adorned with two red flags, you can see the new agricultural implements—complete sets of Soviet animal-drawn machinery—shining in the sun. Farmers frequently come over to look at these red, green, and colorful large wheels, small gears, and wooden frames... These things are unfamiliar to them, but they know that they will make them richer and happier.
    Children wearing new cotton-padded jackets and pants are playing "dodgeball" in the courtyard! Except for a few individuals like Yang Zhonglin, who recently moved from the southern wilderness, it is impossible to find anyone wearing tattered clothes among the hundred or so people in the village. Especially the young women, they wear clean clothes every day. If it happens to be someone's wedding day, almost everyone wears new clothes to attend the wedding feast.
    Every household in the village, except for Old Zheng, raises pigs and chickens. There are more than ninety pigs, eighty chickens, and twenty ducks in the whole village. The income from these sideline occupations alone can amount to a hundred dan of grain a year.
    The whole village has nineteen horses, three mules, and eight donkeys. There are a total of seven carts, some owned individually and some jointly. Every evening, a group of well-fed livestock walks back from the meadow to drink water at the well. The owners draw water for them while humming a little tune, their faces beaming with joy.
    In the whole village, except for two special cases (one is a newcomer, and the other recently married a wife and brought six children), every household has surplus grain. Take Old Zheng as an example. He is fifty-four years old this year and only came to Erlong Mountain in the spring of the year before last. When he came, he only had a tattered cotton-padded coat and a tattered cotton quilt. Now, in addition to replacing all his clothes and bedding, he has six or seven dan of surplus grain at home.
    They have turned themselves around economically!
    They are also working hard on cultural emancipation. Literacy classes are held every day. Since last July, some students have learned more than six hundred characters, and several women can keep accounts. There are words written in chalk on the walls, cabinets, and doors of every household.
    There are already twelve primary school students.
    Singing is something people here are familiar with. Often in the evenings, people beat drums, and men, women, young and old, gather in the courtyard, joyfully twisting and turning while singing heartily: "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..."
  (III) How Did It Change?
    If you just ask the people of Erlong Mountain, they will naturally say: "Thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!" "Our mutual aid is good!" "Everyone's hard work is good!" Indeed, what everyone says is correct. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they wouldn't have been able to turn themselves around. If it weren't for the goodness of mutual aid and hard work, Erlong Mountain wouldn't have changed so quickly!
    In July 1947, during the land reform (distributing green crops), and in December, measuring and evaluating land, the fourteen households in the village were divided into 96.8 mu of land (small mu) and two unusable old horses. Only ninety dan of grain were harvested that autumn. By the spring of 1948, many households lacked livestock, seeds, and food grain, and spring plowing faced difficulties. Although mutual aid was very necessary, people had concerns, fearing "a change of regime" and fearing "being put into a big pile." What to do? Just then, Qi Baoen returned from a training class in the county (he had been a cadre since the land reform and is now the village branch secretary). He addressed these ideas, explaining through large meetings, persuading through small meetings, and mobilizing individually... Using various methods, he explained to everyone: "Whoever works, it's theirs," "Organize together to get rich," ... Everyone was persuaded, but one bachelor, Guo Youwei, refused to do anything. "No forced orders were allowed," so he had to work alone. The mutual aid group was finally organized! It was organized into a village-wide mutual aid group, which was divided into two smaller groups. Covenants were established, labor was used flexibly, and people did what they were capable of: letting Li Chunlin, who had a problem with his arm, drive the cart, letting Old Chen, who was older, hold the plow, and letting Liu Haizhen, who had a backache, be responsible for night watch and helping everyone with odd jobs, and everyone would help him plow and harvest his land. Seeds were also adjusted within the group. At the same time, it was stipulated how much land a plow team would be responsible for sowing. In this way, the land was sown. But when it came time to hoe, food became a problem again. Qi Baoen and everyone came up with a solution: they collected fifty jin of sesame oil (plus borrowed one hundred jin); Qi Baoen took it to Qiqihar and exchanged it for three cart tires, which he then exchanged in Lishu for six dan of grain. Then they collected forty jin of buckwheat flour, plus the money left over from exchanging the oil, and went to Sanjiangkou to exchange it for fourteen and a half jin of cotton, organizing twenty-one women to spin yarn. They also mobilized the women to plant two mu of vegetable gardens. When the vegetables came down, group leader Liu Zhangshi distributed them to everyone to eat every day. In this way, part of the food shortage during hoeing was solved. In order to ensure the completion of the hoeing, and to make sure that those who were hoeing ate dry rice, it was stipulated that they would eat together. Everyone else ate a little worse with bran and vegetables. In this way, by cutting back and saving, they successfully did two hoeings (because of the soil and climate conditions here, three hoeings are generally not done) without leaving a single ridge unhoed. At this time, Guo Youwei, who was working alone, got sick and went to stay with relatives. When he recovered and returned to his field, he was stunned! "Hoe as much as you can!" But what was in front of him was completely contrary to what he had thought. There was not a single weed in the field, and the seedlings were as strong as the seedlings in other fields. He was so happy that he jumped up. At this time, he realized the benefits of mutual aid and took the initiative to join the mutual aid group.
    Li Guoqing, a tenant middle peasant who used to farm here, was afraid of being struggled against during the land reform and fled to the southern wilderness. Now, he wants to come back, but he owes people three dan of grain there, and people want to keep his white horse to pay off the debt. Qi Baoen and everyone discussed it, and as a result, everyone collected three dan of grain, hitched it to a cart, and brought him back. Everyone also vacated a house for him and lent him food grain. The middle peasant happily said: "If I had known you would treat me like this, I would have come back sooner!"
    1948 was a year of arduous struggle for the people of Erlong Mountain. In this year, they endured hunger and hardship, but when they roughly calculated the detailed accounts of the whole year's production, they felt relieved: in addition to eating green crops, they harvested more than two hundred and fifty dan of grain (about three times the output of 1947). Hoeing together (twice) saved more than one hundred and eighty workdays. Because they ate at the house of whoever they worked for, they saved more than seventy jin of oil. Women spinning yarn brought in forty-three pieces of homespun cloth and bought five horses, three mules, and three carts. The number of chickens, ducks, and pigs all increased, and every household added several new clothes... It was also in this year of arduous struggle that the people of Erlong Mountain deeply realized the benefits of labor mutual aid. Everyone's feelings became harmonious!
    The following year, they accepted the experience of the previous year and researched ways to improve the mutual aid group: scoring by the piece (ridge), recording workdays daily, clearing accounts in a timely manner, equal pay for equal work (including the elderly, young, and women), and elected Qi Baoen's wife, the only person in the village who could keep accounts, to keep work records for everyone.
    In the spring, the government called for reclaiming wasteland. A problem arose again in Erlong Mountain. Some people thought: "We can't even take care of the cultivated land, why reclaim wasteland?" "Why do we need so much land? It's enough to eat and drink!" Some people also thought: "What if we harvest too much grain and it's not worth anything?" ... Qi Baoen held meetings with everyone or mobilized them individually, but he still couldn't mobilize them. He was worried for several days. Suddenly one night, he quietly took a shovel and went to the western meadow, digging a pile of soil every short distance (as a sign of claiming wasteland), all the way to the edge of the western meadow.
    Two days later, someone went to pull alkali soil and discovered the piles of soil. They came back and told everyone, and everyone became anxious. They held a meeting in the evening to discuss the reclamation of wasteland. Qi Baoen then said to everyone: "Occupying it alone is useless, it only counts if you reclaim it!" "If we don't reclaim more wasteland now, it will be too late to regret it when we use tractors in the future and there isn't enough land to plant!"
    The next day, he and Old Chen's family, a military dependent, hitched up a plow team and started plowing on the western meadow. Then everyone gathered four plow teams and plowed more than thirty mu of land in five days.
    In 1949, the whole village's income was even higher: a total of more than three hundred and seventy dan of grain was harvested, averaging four dan of grain per person (excluding sideline income), and three mules and horses and a cart were purchased.
    The people of Erlong Mountain have become rich in this way. Their secret to wealth is:
  "Labor mutual aid, common prosperity!"
    Although the people of Erlong Mountain are already living a relatively affluent life, they are not satisfied.
    This year, they plan to use animal-drawn machinery to reclaim twenty mu of wasteland, plant five thousand trees, and grow more wheat, cotton, and soybeans.
    "In a couple of years, we'll rebuild these low houses and install glass windows." "When the trees grow up in a few years, the land won't be eroded by the wind anymore."
    The people of Erlong Mountain have already seen a happy future, and they are moving forward with full confidence.

　　二龙山变样了！
    刘纯茂　时中
    二龙山这个地名，在辽西已为很多人所熟悉了。它是东北人民政府农林部贷给新农具——全套苏联马拉机——的重点之一。并且在该省劳动模范大会上，他们的代表齐宝恩，又以“小组为基础的联合大组”，赢得了“模范互助组”的一等红旗。这个接近大沙漠的草甸子上的“新农村”——二龙山，究竟它是什么样呢？
  （一）一个佃户林
    二龙山的十几户人家，从前除去两户过得较富裕些的大佃户之外，都是依靠扛大活租地种的雇贫农。附近的土地和房屋全是“丁司令”（张作霖手下的军阀）的，由一个中农转租下来，把自己种不过来的再分租给贫农耕种。年年到打完场的时候，“丁司令”的管家，就赶着几辆大骡挂儿，耀武扬威地来到二龙山，享受着大佃户给他准备好的上等酒席和大烟之后，鞭子一扬，二龙山人们的一年劳动果实，就被劫走了。劳动的人们默默地站在大道旁，看着那越走越远的粮车，不由地想起了自己坐在炕上因为没有裤子穿不能下炕的老婆，那一群张着嘴等吃的孩子……。
    二龙山穷人的酸辛说不完！没满十岁的小孩子，就得给地主家去放牛，三九天没鞋穿，冻得把脚伸进牛粪里去暖和。一家七八口人，挤在一间化了好几石粮租来的小破屋子里住，虽然住的是那样蹩脚，但还得受着不让住的威胁，房租年年增加着。
    几百年来，二龙山不知道生了多少受苦人，也不知道死去了多少受苦人。
  （二）新农村
    二龙山的确变了！
    刚一走进插着两面红旗的屯大门，就可以看到摆在那儿的新农具——全套苏联马拉机——在太阳底下放光。农民们不时地过来看看这油漆得红红绿绿的大轮子、小轱辘、木头框子……。这些，在他们很生疏，但却知道它们将能使自己更富裕、更幸福。
    穿着新棉袄棉裤的孩子们，在院子里“打排”玩儿呢！除了新从南荒搬来的杨忠林等个别人外，全屯百多口人已经找不到穿破褴衣裳的人了。尤其是年青妇女，她们平日穿的都是干干净净的，若赶上谁家婚娶的日子，她们几乎每人都穿上新衣裳去吃喜酒。
    全屯除掉老郑头不算在内，其余家家都养着猪、鸡。全屯一共有九十多口猪、八十多只鸡、二十多只鸭子。光是这些副业，一年的收入就能有百来石粮。
    全屯统共有十九匹马、三头骡子、八条毛驴子。连一家拴的带合伙拴的统共有七台车。每天傍晚，一群喂得溜圆的牲口，从甸子上走回来，到井台上去喝水，主人一面给它们打水，一面哼着小曲，脸上洋溢着喜悦的光辉。
    全屯除了两户特殊情况（一家是新来的，一家新娶了媳妇，还带来了六个孩子），家家都有余粮。就拿老郑头来说吧，他今年五十四岁，前年春天，才投奔到二龙山来的。来时，只有一身破棉衣，一床破棉被。现在除了衣被都换外，家里还有六七石余粮。
    他们在经济上翻身了！
    他们也正在努力着文化的翻身。识字班每天上课，从去年七月到现在，有的学员已经认识六百多字，并且有几个妇女能记账了。家家的墙上、柜上、门上、都有粉笔写的字。
    小学生已经有十二个了。
    唱歌，是这里人们熟习的事，时常在晚上，人们敲上鼓，男女老少都聚集到院子里，一面欢乐地扭，一面尽情地唱着：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。……”
  （三）是怎样变的？
    只要随便向二龙山的人们一问，他们就会很自然地说：“多亏毛主席、共产党！”“我们互助的好！”“大家劳动的好！”实在，大家说的都对，若不是毛主席、共产党，他们翻不了身；若不是互助的好，劳动的好，二龙山变得不会这样快！
    一九四七年七月土地改革（分青苗），十二月丈评土地，全屯十四户，分进了九六·八垧地（小亩）和两匹不能用的老马。当年秋收只打了九十多石粮。到一九四八年春，就有好多户缺牲畜、缺种粮、口粮，春耕发生了困难。虽然，互助是非常必要了。但这时大家思想有顾虑，怕“变天”，怕“归大堆”；怎么办呢？正在这时，齐宝恩从县里训练班受训回来了（从土地改革开始，他就当干部，现在是村支部书记），他就针对这些思想，利用大会讲解，小会说服，个别动员……各种方式向大家解说：“谁劳动是谁的”，“组织起来共同发家”，……大家都被说服了；但只有一个独身汉郭有为说什么也不干。“不许强迫命令”，只好让他单干了。互助组终于组织起来了！组织成了一个全屯大互助组，在大组之中分成了两个小组。定出公约，灵活运用劳动力，能干啥干啥：让胳膊有毛病的李春林赶车，让上岁数的老陈头扶犁，让有腰疼病的刘海振专负责任打更和帮大家干零活，大家给他铲、割地。种籽也在组内实行了调剂。同时，规定了一付犁仗包种多少地。就这样，地种上了。但到开铲的时候，吃粮又成了问题，齐宝恩就和大家想出一个办法：齐了五十斤麻籽油（加上外借一百斤）；由齐宝恩携带着到齐齐哈尔换回了三台车胶，又折到梨树换来了六石粮。接着又齐了四十斤荞麦面，加上换油剩的钱，到三江口换回了十四斤半棉花，组织了二十一个妇女纺线。又动员妇女种了两亩水园子。菜下来了，每天由组长刘张氏把菜分配给大家吃。这样，解决了一部分铲地时候的口粮。为了保证铲趟的完成，使铲地的人吃得干饭，就规定他们在一起吃饭。其他的人都是糠菜吃得坏点。这样缩食节约，胜利地作到了两铲两趟（这里因土质、气候关系一般都不铲趟三遍），没荒一根垄。这个时候，单干的郭有为闹病了，跑到亲戚家去住。当他病好了回来到自己地里一看，怔住了！能铲多少就算得多少吧！”可是，摆在眼前和他想的完全相反，地里没有一根草，小苗儿和其他地里的小苗一样的粗壮，他高兴得蹦起来。他这时才认清了互助的好处，主动地要求参加了互助组。
    从前在这儿种地的佃中农李国卿，土地改革时怕斗，躲到南荒去了。如今，他又想回来，可是在那里他欠了人家三石粮，人家要留他的白马抵债。齐宝恩就和大家讨论，结果，大家给齐了三石粮，套着车把他接回来，大家又给他腾房子、借吃粮，中农乐的说：“知道你们能这样待我，我早就回来了！”
    一九四八年，是二龙山人们艰苦战斗的一年。这一年里，他们忍饥挨饿，备尝辛苦，但当他们大致算了一下全年生产的细账，心里都落底了：除了啃青净打粮二百五十多石（约等于四七年产量三倍），在一起铲地（两遍）共省了一百八十多个工。由于给谁干活在谁家吃饭省了七十多斤油，妇女纺线搞进四十三块家织布，买进了五匹马，三头骡子，三台车。鸡、鸭、猪都增多了，家家户户都添了几件新衣服，……。也就是在这艰苦战斗的一年里，二龙山的人们，都深深地体会到劳动互助的好处。大家的情感融洽了！
    转过年来，他们接受了去年的经验，研究出了改进互助组办法：按件（垄）评分，天天记工，及时清账，同工同酬（老、幼、妇女都在内）等办法，并选出了全屯唯一能记账的齐宝恩妻子给大家记工账。
    开春，政府号召开荒，在二龙山又发生了问题。有的人认为：“熟地都侍弄不过来，还开啥荒呢？”“要那么多地干啥？够吃够喝就得呗！”也有的认为：“粮打多了，不值钱怎么办？”……齐宝恩给大家开会或者是个别动员还是发动不起来，他一连愁了好几天，忽然一天晚上他悄悄地拿着铁锹来到了西甸子，隔不远挖了一堆土（占荒的标帜），一直挖到西甸子边上。
    过了两天，有人去拉碱土，发见了土堆，回来对大家讲，大家都着急了，晚上就开会，研究开荒的事。齐宝恩这时就对大家说：“寡占不顶用，得开起来才算呢！”“现在不多开荒，往后使拖拉机，地不够种，后悔也晚了！”
    第二天，他和军属老陈家拴了一付犁仗，到西甸子上就开上了，接着大家就凑了四付犁仗，五天就开了三十多垧地。
    四九年全屯收入更多了：一共打了三百七十多石粮，平均每个人收入四石来粮（副业收入不在内），又买进了三匹骡马、一台车。
    二龙山的人们就是这样富裕起来的。他们富裕的秘诀就是：
  “劳动互助，共同发家！”
    虽然，二龙山的人们已经过着了较比富裕的生活，但他们并没有满足。
    今年计划要用马拉机开二十垧荒，植五千棵树，多种麦子、棉花、大豆。
    “过两年把这些矮房翻盖起来，按上玻璃窗。”“等几年树长起来，地再不能受风刮了。”
    二龙山的人们，已经看到了幸福的远景，他们正怀满信心的前进着。
