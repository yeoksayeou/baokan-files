The Urgent Problems to be Solved in the Subei Guidance of the Yi River Project

By our reporter Yong Jin

In the spring guidance of the Yi River project, the Huaiyin District of Subei mobilized 300,000 male and female laborers. The difficulty of the task is unprecedented in Subei. Since the start of construction in the spring, great achievements have been made thanks to the efforts of all cadres and the masses. If there are no more rainy days before the wheat harvest, it will be possible to complete 27 million cubic meters of earthwork.

Due to financial difficulties and the urgency of time, coupled with a lack of experience in river management, there are several urgent problems in the work that need to be solved:

One, the wage issue. According to investigations in Xin'an, Suining, Suqian, and Shuyang counties, there are only a few relatively simple methods for wages. Except for Zhangshan Cutting Ridge in Xin'an County, where one cubic meter of earthwork is set at 8.25 lbs of coarse grain, the general standard is 2.25 lbs of coarse grain. This commits the mistake of egalitarianism. In reality, there are great differences in soil quality between counties, districts, and even villages. For example, the Tanggou District and Shizi District of Shuyang County generally have sandy soil, and each person can move an average of 5 cubic meters per day, up to a maximum of 13 cubic meters, earning more than 30 lbs of grain per day. In contrast, the eastern end of Suining mostly has black silty soil, which is very difficult to extract. Suqian County also mostly has silty soil, and some areas of Shaodian District still have a lot of water, requiring mud to be dredged from the water, but the wages here are also 2.25 lbs. County Chief Yan of Suqian stated that it is very difficult to combine river work with disaster relief in Suqian, and some even have to lose money. Although it has recently been decided to supplement one pound of grain per person per day for disaster relief in difficult work sections, the wages for river embankments must also be reasonably resolved. When necessary, counties and districts can conduct evaluations based on the quality of the soil to determine the wage per cubic meter. This will further stimulate the enthusiasm of the laborers and take care of more disaster-stricken households. The leading organs have now begun to pay attention to solving this problem.

Two, the issue of sanitation for river workers. This is also an urgent problem that needs to be solved for river workers. Most of the laborers are disaster victims with weakened physical strength. Once infectious diseases are discovered on the river project, they can easily spread. According to responsible comrades, there have been deaths among the laborers since the start of construction in the spring. Recurrent fever infectious disease has also been discovered in Siyang County. In the Waji District of Shuyang, out of more than 3,000 river workers, there are 328 sick.

Although the leading organs have paid attention to this issue and issued instructions a long time ago, this issue has not yet attracted more serious attention on the river project. In many places, such as Xin'an and most areas of Shuyang, the housing, cooking stoves, and toilets of the river workers are very close to each other, and the laborers sleep on the ground, etc. The departments leading the river workers should pay attention to organizing and mobilizing the laborers to try to overcome difficulties and arrange their daily lives better.

Three, in terms of engineering, only Shuyang and Suqian are using pile drivers on the nearly 400 li of the Yi River. From Xin'an County to the 80-plus li of river project in Shuyang, it is rare to see pile driving. The reason for not using pile drivers is said to be that the silty soil is hard and does not require pile driving, and also that the water of the Yi River will recede in only five or six days. Pile driving is only necessary in sandy soil areas. However, even in sandy soil areas, only the side closest to the water is being piled (i.e., half of the embankment). This poses a great danger because the New Yi embankment was tested by the spring rains of late March. In the Yanjii section of Shuyang, east of Yanjii, some sections of the New Yi embankment have been severely damaged by the rain, and some have collapsed by more than half a foot. The consequences for the New Yi River embankment in the summer and autumn rainy seasons can be imagined. The leading organs must pay more serious attention to this issue and should emphasize on the river embankment that not only should the embankment be built quickly, but it must also ensure the firmness of the Yi embankment. Fully pile driving will not affect more financial expenditures or delay the completion of the Yi River project.

Four, the issue of relocation for residents throughout the riverbed. There are more than 13,000 households in the riverbed, and only more than 1,000 households have moved out so far. Many of those who have moved out have not been properly resettled. Many residents do not agree with the relocation. Although there are still more than two months before the rainy season, we should provide more in-depth and specific assistance to the households in the riverbed to solve the difficulties in their relocation. Naturally, the difficulty of funding is a major issue, but more importantly, we must carry out ideological mobilization for the riverbed households so that they recognize the benefits of moving early. If the relocation problem of these more than 10,000 households in the riverbed is not resolved in time, we will be passive when the rainy season arrives.

　　苏北导沂中急待解决的问题
    本报记者  勇进
    在春季导沂中，苏北淮阴分区发动了三十万男女民工，其任务之艰难是苏北空前所未有的。春季动工以来，在全体干部及群众的努力下，已获得了很大的成绩。至麦收前如没更多的雨天，将可完成二千七百万公方土的任务。
    由于财政上的困难与时间的仓促，加以还缺乏治河的经验，在工作上存在着几个急待解决的问题：
    一、工资问题。据新安、睢宁、宿迁、沭阳几个县的了解，在工资方面只有几种比较简单的办法，除新安县的嶂山切岭，做一公方土工订为八斤四两粗粮外，其他一般都是二斤四两粗粮。这样就犯了平均主义的毛病。实际上县与县之间，区与区之间甚至于村与村之间，土质就有很大的区别，如沭阳县的塘沟区十字区一般多是沙土地，每人每日平均做五公方，最多到十三公方，每日可得粮三十余斤，而在睢宁的东端多是黑淤土，取土甚难。宿迁县亦多是淤土，邵店区部分地区还存着很多水，须从水里捞泥，但这里的工资也是二斤四两。据该县颜县长谈宿迁在结合救灾上面是很困难的，甚至还有的要赔本。最近虽决定困难工段，每日每人补一斤粮救灾，但河堤工资亦须合理解决，必要时，可以县区为单位，根据土质的好坏进行评议，决定每公方工资。这样会更加发挥民工的积极性，也会照顾到更多的灾户。现在领导机关，已开始注意解决这一问题。
    二、河工卫生问题，这也是河工上当前急须解决的问题。民工大部分是灾民，体力衰弱，一旦河工上发现传染病，很容易蔓延起来的。据负责同志谈，春季开工以来已有民工死亡现象发生。在泗阳县亦发现回归热传染病，沭阳瓦基区三千余河工中即有三二八个病号。
    领导机关虽注意了这一问题，很久以前即发出指示。但在河工上对这一问题还没引起更严重的注意。很多地方如新安、沭阳等大部分地区河工的住屋、锅灶、厕所均相离很近，民工们都睡在地上等，这些领导河工的部门应注意组织发动民工，尽量想法克服困难把日常生活安排得更好。
    三、在工程方面，近四百华里的沂河上，仅有沭阳、宿迁打硪。从新安县到沭阳八十余里河工上，很少看到打硪的。不打硪的原因据说是淤土地土质硬用不着打硪，再就是沂水只五六天即可下去。只沙土地带打打就可以了。但在沙土地带还只是打靠水的一面（即堤的一半）。这样就有很大的危险性，因为三月下旬几天的春雨中就考验了这个新沂堤，在沭阳段工颜集以东新沂堤上，有的已被雨冲得不堪，有的塌陷半尺多。如遇夏秋雨季新沂河堤就可想而知了。领导机关必须更严重的注意这一问题，应当在河堤上提出不但筑堤快，而切要保证沂堤的坚固。如全部打硪也不会影响到更多的财经开支或延迟沂河工程的完工。
    四、整个河床居民搬家问题。河床内共一万三千多户，现在只有一千多户搬出，搬出者还多没有安插好。很多居民对搬家思想不通。现在虽离雨季尚有两个多月，我们应当对河床户作更深入更具体的帮助，来解决他们搬家中的困难，自然经费的困难是一很大问题，更重要的是对河床户作思想的动员，使他们认识到早搬家的好处。如果不及时解决这一万多户河床居民的搬家问题，雨季到来就会处于被动。
