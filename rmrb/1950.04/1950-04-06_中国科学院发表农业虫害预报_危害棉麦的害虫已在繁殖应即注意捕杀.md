Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences has issued an agricultural pest forecast, pointing out that aphids harmful to cotton and wheat sawflies are already breeding, and all regions should immediately kill them. Regarding cotton aphids, according to an investigation by the Entomology Research Office of the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences, cotton aphids began to appear as early as the beginning of March. They parasitize on weeds, especially on the roots of sow thistle. So far, they have reproduced for two or three generations. There are thousands of cotton aphids on the roots of one sow thistle plant. Now that the weather is gradually warming, cotton aphids are gradually moving from the roots to the leaves. When the cotton plants grow to three or four inches high in May, they will migrate to the cotton plants. The most harmful period is from late May to July. Especially from late May to June, cotton plants are young and most vulnerable to pests. The way to prevent cotton aphids in advance is to dig up the roots of sow thistle as early as possible, especially to uproot the sow thistle on the sunny ridges, because cotton aphids occur earliest and reproduce fastest on the sunny ridges.

Regarding the wheat pest, the wheat sawfly, according to an investigation by the Larval Research Office of the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences, wheat sawflies have only appeared for a few days this year, but there are several times more than last year. Although the wheat has not yet been harmed, the wheat sawflies are laying eggs. The wheat sawfly hatches from eggs into larvae in early April and begins to eat wheat leaves; in late April, the larvae are more than half an inch long and eat wheat leaves in groups; in early May, these larvae go underground to pupate, and will emerge again next year to cause harm. The simplest way to eliminate them is to catch them by hand; secondly, use stomach poisons to kill the larvae, such as using rotenone root powder mixed with 300 to 500 times water, or using one catty of lead arsenate mixed with 200 to 250 catties of water, which can kill the larvae. Or take advantage of the habit of wheat sawfly larvae falling to the ground when startled, shake the wheat plants to make the larvae fall to the ground and then kill them. In addition, winter plowing can also expose the overwintering pupae hidden underground, allowing birds and animals to peck at them; crop rotation can also eliminate the adults that hibernate in the soil near the wheat roots.

　　中国科学院发表农业虫害预报
    危害棉麦的害虫已在繁殖应即注意捕杀
    【新华社四日讯】中国科学院发表农业虫害预报，指出危害棉花的蚜虫和危害小麦的麦叶蜂已在繁殖，各地应即捕杀。关于棉蚜，据科学院动物研究所昆虫学研究室调查，棉蚜早已在三月初开始发生。它寄生在野草上，尤其是苦荬菜的根上，到现在为止，已经繁殖了两三代。一株苦荬菜的根上有成千的棉蚜。现在天气渐暖，棉蚜也渐渐从根部移到叶部。等到五月里，棉株长到三、四寸高的时候，它便迁移到棉株上来。为害最烈的时期，是五月下旬到七月。尤其是五月下旬到六月这一段时间，棉株幼小，最经不起虫害。预先防止棉蚜的办法，是趁早挖掉苦荬菜的根，特别要连根铲除向阳田埂的苦荬菜，因为向阳的田埂上棉蚜发生最早，繁殖最快。
    关于小麦的害虫——麦叶蜂，据科学院动物学研究所幼虫学研究室调查，今年麦叶蜂才发生了几天，比去年要多几倍。现在麦子虽还没有受害，可是麦叶蜂正在产卵。麦叶蜂在四月初由卵孵化为幼虫，开始吃麦叶；四月下旬，幼虫有半寸多长，成群吃麦叶；五月初这些幼虫便下土作茧，明年再出来为害。最简便的消灭办法就是用手捕捉；其次，就是用胃毒剂杀死幼虫，如用鱼藤根粉加三百倍至五百倍的水，或用砒酸铅一斤，加水二百至二百五十斤，都可以杀死幼虫。或利用麦叶蜂幼虫受惊堕地的习性，振动麦株，使幼虫堕地后再把它杀死。此外，冬耕翻土也可以使越冬藏在地下的蛹暴露出来，让鸟兽啄食；轮种也可消灭在麦根附近入土休眠的成虫。
