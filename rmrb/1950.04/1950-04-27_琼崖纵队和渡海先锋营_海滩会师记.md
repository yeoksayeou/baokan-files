　　Meeting of the Qiongya Column and the Landing Vanguard Battalion on the Beach
　　Gao Xue
　　On March 6th, a unit of the Qiongya Column and the Landing Main Force Vanguard Battalion victoriously joined forces on a beach in a certain area of Hainan Island.

　　The Qiongya Column unit responsible for the reception marched non-stop towards the seaside from a certain location, day and night, and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy near the coast before the vanguard troops arrived. As soon as the cannons on the Landing Force ships sounded, the Qiongya Column soldiers charged towards the coast from seven or eight miles away. At this time, the brave men of the Landing Vanguard Battalion jumped from the ships into the neck-deep water, rushing towards the beach. Under the combined attack from front and rear, the defending enemy fled in panic. The two brotherly forces met warmly. Despite the enemy planes circling overhead, joy boiled in the hearts of the warriors. They cheered, they embraced. The tall soldiers from the North embraced the smaller soldiers of the Qiongya Column like older brothers hugging younger brothers. Although the languages were different, the cheers and embraces expressed an excitement that words could not describe.

　　The Qiongya Column soldiers wiped the sweat from the faces of their elder brothers with face towels; the Landing Force soldiers took the hands of their little Qiongya Column brothers, invited them to sit on their backpacks, and stuffed the cigarettes and biscuits they brought into their hands. One side sang: "Our army has arrived, crossing the ocean in a mighty force!" The other side continued: "Wherever the enemy flees, we will eliminate them there...".

　　The subsequent ships arrived. Risking the enemy planes' strafing, the Qiongya Column soldiers rushed onto the ships to carry ammunition, insisting that the Landing Force soldiers rest in concealed places on the beach. The Qiongya Column soldiers waded through deep water, staggering as they carried bullets and the wounded ashore. The Qiongya Column female nurses, with excited and joyful tears in their eyes, carefully changed clothes and applied medicine to the wounded. The sincere class friendship moved the warriors who had fought across thousands of miles and experienced hundreds of battles to tears.

　　In order to receive the Landing Force, the Qiongya Column had pre-organized work teams,慰问teams,帮工teams, sewing and washing teams, and tea service teams. As soon as the Vanguard Battalion arrived, each team actively started working. The Qiongya Column soldiers automatically proposed "Four Concessions" to the Landing Force: giving them the best food, the best meat, the best vegetables, and the best barracks, and volunteered to guard the Landing Force day and night. These friendly actions deeply moved the Landing Force. They also voluntarily gave up three barracks to the later Qiongya Column troops, and also universally wrote letters of慰问to the Qiongya Column troops. The soldiers of the First Company expressed their gratitude in the letter for the thoughtful care of the Qiongya Column troops, and expressed their admiration and respect for the Qiongya Column's unyielding and arduous struggle for more than twenty years.

　　The spirit of mutual respect and mutual care between the two brotherly forces in the victorious meeting demonstrated the noble friendship of the proletarian ranks. It is in this way that they are united and cordially fighting side by side, and advancing towards the road to victory with full confidence.

　　琼崖纵队和渡海先锋营
    海滩会师记
    高雪
    三月六日，琼崖纵队的一部和渡海主力先锋营在海南岛某地的海滩上胜利会师了。
    担任接应任务的琼纵某部，从某地昼夜不停地向海边进军，在先锋部队未抵达前，与敌军在海岸附近展开了激战。渡海部队船上的炮声一响，琼纵的战士们从七八里路远的地方向海岸猛冲过去。这时候，渡海先锋营的勇士们从船上跳入没颈的海水中，奔向海滩。在前后夹击之下，守敌狼狈溃逃。两支兄弟部队热烈地会师了。尽管敌机还在头顶上盘旋，勇士们内心沸腾着喜悦。他们欢呼、他们拥抱。来自北方的身躯高大的战士们，象哥哥抱弟弟一样拥抱着身躯较小的琼纵的战士们。语言虽然不通，欢呼和拥抱表达了无法用言语来形容的兴奋。
    琼纵的战士们用面巾擦干了老大哥们脸上的汗；渡海战士拉着琼纵小弟弟们的手，请他们坐在背包上，把带来的香烟、饼干直往他们的手上塞。一边唱着：“我们的队伍来了，浩浩荡荡渡过海洋！”另一边接着唱：“敌人逃到那里就消灭它在那里……”。
    后续的船只到齐了。琼纵的战士们冒着敌机的扫射，抢着上船去搬运弹药硬把渡海战士按在海滩隐蔽处休息。琼纵的战士们，涉渡深水，一摇一幌地把子弹和伤员都抬运下来琼纵的女看护员噙着兴奋、快乐的眼泪，小心地为伤员换衣上药。真挚的阶级友爱使转战万里、身经百战的战士们也感动得忍不住流出眼泪来。
    为了接应渡海大军，琼纵预先组织好了工作队、慰问队、帮工队、缝洗队和茶水队。先锋营一到，各队立刻活跃地展开工作。琼纵战士们自动对渡海部队提出“四让”：让好饭、让好肉、让好菜、让好营房，并且抢着为渡海部队担任昼夜的警戒。这些友爱的行动深深感动了渡海部队。他们也自动地让出三间营房给后来的琼纵部队，同时还普遍地给琼纵部队写了慰问信。第一连的战士在信中对琼纵部队周到的照顾表示感谢，对琼纵坚持了二十多年不屈不挠的艰苦斗争表示羡慕和钦佩。
    两支兄弟部队在胜利会师中互相尊重，互相照顾的精神，表现了无产阶级队伍的崇高友爱。他们就是这样团结而亲切地在一起并肩作战，满怀信心地向着胜利的道路前进。
