Promote the Glorious Tradition of Hard Struggle
　　Liu Songtao
    In China's current economic situation, all work must be based on the principle of "spend less money, do good work." Avoid spending money when possible, and postpone things that can be delayed.

    However, some schools in certain areas have the intention of "everything being revitalized," demanding perfection in everything. Taking the purchase of specimens and instruments as an example, some schools insist on buying even easily collected specimens like locusts and butterflies from large bookstores in Shanghai, thinking that this is the only way to achieve perfection. They attribute the poor performance of their schools entirely to insufficient funding. When financial authorities are slightly unable to meet their wishes, they feel that the leadership does not pay enough attention to education and become discouraged. This kind of thinking is very harmful to promoting our current educational work.

    Every educator must recognize the temporary financial difficulties of the country, distinguish between urgent and non-urgent matters, be realistic, and maximize the effectiveness of the funds provided by the state. If the living conditions of the local people are very difficult, or the funding is truly unsustainable, we need to use our own hands and brains to overcome the difficulties. China's education cause, starting from the Soviet areas in Jiangxi, has grown and strengthened for more than twenty years through ten years of civil war, eight years of war against Japanese aggression, and four years of liberation war, all under the environment of frequent wars and extremely difficult material conditions. During the war against Japanese aggression, when some schools' buildings and desks were burned by the enemy, teachers and students built their own school buildings, made desks and benches out of adobe, and collected specimens and made instruments themselves. Sometimes, due to severe famine, schools had financial difficulties, so teachers and students jointly engaged in production to make up for the shortfall. Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary cadres were trained under such circumstances. Recently, there have also been many examples of overcoming difficulties by doing things ourselves, such as: students in the Bohai area building school buildings themselves, saving 30,000 jin of grain. The school-building movement in Fengcheng Middle School in Liaodong Province saved the public treasury 105 million yuan. Jiaocheng County in Shanxi Province implemented a village-based budget approved by the county, spending only 30,000 jin of millet to hire a few technicians and buy some lime, with the rest relying on teachers and students' manual labor, and the masses contributing labor and materials, resulting in the construction of 68 schools throughout the county. One district in Zhangbei, Chahar, also used this method to build 29 schools. A middle school in Jinan made more than 40 kinds of physical instruments and collected and sorted out more than 100 kinds of specimens. Liaoyang No. 1 Middle School in Liaodong Province, teachers and students made 240 charts and 3 models, and collected specimens, instruments, and teaching aids worth about 43 million yuan. This spirit is worth praising and promoting. Of course, it must be strictly pointed out here that in some areas where conditions are not very difficult, it is completely wrong to mechanically use the excuse of "establishing a labor viewpoint and reforming oneself through labor" to reduce students' class time and neglect their studies.

    This is not to say that we are forever satisfied with makeshift conditions. Chairman Mao instructed us: "With the advent of the economic upsurge, there will inevitably be a high tide of cultural construction." When the country's economic conditions permit, our schools must have complete books and instruments, and build scientific, suitable, and very particular school buildings.

    Therefore, every educator should understand the current financial difficulties of the country, save as much as possible, and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle of educational work cadres in the revolutionary war to overcome all difficulties. Now our situation is vastly different from the past, and we believe that with the efforts of all educators, we are fully confident of doing a good job in our work.

　　发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统
    刘松涛
    在我国目前经济情况下，一切工作要基于“花钱要少，工作要好”这一原则。可以不花的钱，尽量不花，可以缓办的事，就暂时缓办。
    可是某些地区有些学校，却抱有“百废俱兴”的打算，一切要求十全十美。单拿购买标本仪器一项来说，有的学校，甚至像蝗虫、蝴蝶之类极易采集的标本，也一定到上海的大书局去买，以为这样才算得完美。把自己学校工作搞不好的原因，完全归罪于经费不足。当财政机关，稍微不能满足自己的愿望时，就认为领导上对教育重视不够，情绪消沉。这种想法，对推进我们目前的教育工作，是非常有害的。
    每个教育工作者，必需认识当前国家财政暂时的困难，分清缓急，实事求是，使国家供给的经费发挥它最大效能。如果当地人民生活条件十分困难，或经费实在无法维持，我们就需要自己用手用脑，克服困难。中国人民的教育事业，从江西的苏区起，经过十年内战、八年抗战、四年解放战争，二十多年来，一直是在战争频繁、物质条件极端困难的环境下生长壮大起来的。在抗战中有的学校校舍、桌凳被敌人烧毁了，师生就自己修筑校舍，用土坯垒成土桌土凳，并自己采集标本，制造仪器。有时因灾荒严重，学校经费困难，师生便共同生产以补不足。成千成万的革命干部，就是在这种情况下培养出来的。最近也有不少这样自己动手克服困难的范例，如：渤海区学生自己动手建筑校舍，节约粮食三万斤。辽东省凤城中学的建校运动，给公家节省了经费一亿零五千元。山西交城县实行村造预算，由县批准，只费三万斤小米雇少数技工，买了一些石灰，其余均靠师生动手，群众助工献料，全县修建学校六十八处。察哈尔张北一个区，亦用此法建校二十九处。济南某中学自制物理仪器四十多种，整理和采集标本一百多种。辽东辽阳一中，师生自制图表二百四十幅，模型三具，收集标本仪器教具，约值达四千三百万元。这精神都值得表扬和推广。当然，这里必须严格指出，有些地区条件并非十分困难，只是机械的借口“建立劳动观点，以劳动改造自己”减少学生上课时间，荒废学业，则是十分错误的。
    这不是说我们永远满足于因陋就简的状况，毛主席指示我们：“随着经济高潮的到来，不可避免的将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”在国家经济条件允许的时候，我们的学校，一定要有完备的图书仪器，要建筑科学、适用、非常讲究的校舍。
    因此，每个教育工作者应该体谅国家目前财政的困难，能够节省的尽量节省，要发扬革命战争中教育工作干部艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，来战胜一切困难。现在我们的局面，比之过去，已有着天渊之别，相信在全体教育工作者努力之下，搞好我们的工作是完全有把握的。
