　　Three Seas Dredging Project Begins
　　Western Moat Dredging to be Completed in Ten Days
　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The dredging project of the North Sea, Central Sea, and South Sea began yesterday (6th). Preparations for this project began in February this year, starting with dredging the drainage canals of the Three Seas from the Rizhige Sluice Gate through Changpu River to the Yuhe Underground Canal, as well as the water supply canals of the Jinhe River, Chang River, and Northwest Moat. To prevent the excessive flow rate at the Three Seas outlet from scouring the riverbanks, stone revetments were built along the banks of the Weaver Girl River on the Three Seas drainage canal. Water was released starting from March 11th, and the process went smoothly. To facilitate the discharge of water from the Three Seas and completely drain the accumulated water in low-lying areas, a 21-meter-long drainage canal was dug on the south side of the outlet, Hulu Mouth, and several main and branch ditches connecting the main ditches were dug throughout the Three Seas. As of the end of last month, 1.46 million cubic meters of accumulated water in the Three Seas had been drained. After five days of drying, most of the lakebed soil has dried out and can be excavated. To complete this massive project before the rainy season, work began in the North Sea yesterday, and work in the Central Sea and South Sea will begin in sequence within days.
　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The dredging project of the Western Moat in this city began on the 4th. This section of the project runs from the Xizhimen Tricrossing to Xibianmen, with a total length of 5,520 meters. Most of the participants in this dredging project are farmers from the 13th and 16th districts. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the 10th of this month.

　　三海疏浚工程开工
    西护城河十日可完成疏浚工作
    【京市新闻处讯】北海、中海、南海疏浚工程已于昨（六）日开始。本年二月即进行这项工程的准备工作，首将三海的排水渠自日知阁闸起经菖蒲河至御河暗沟及其供水渠金河长河西北护城河进行疏浚；为了防止三海出水口流速过大冲刷河岸，并在三海排水渠的织女河沿岸修筑了石护岸。三月十一日起开始启闸放水，经过情形顺利，为使三海贮水易于宣泄，低洼地方积水全部排出，曾在出水口葫芦嘴的南面另掘了一长二十一公尺的排水渠，且纵贯三海挖了若干干沟及连接干沟的支沟。截至上月底止三海积水一百四十六万立方公尺均已排尽，经五天来晾晒湖底土壤大部干涸，可以挑挖。为了争取在雨季前完成这一浩大工程，昨日起先在北海开工，中海、南海，日内即可依次开工。
    【京市新闻处讯】本市西护城河的疏浚工程，已于四日开始。此段工程系由西直门三岔口至西便门，全长五千五百二十公尺。参加这一疏浚工程的大部是十三、十六两区农民。预计本月十日即可全部完工。
