　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau officially approved the Beijing Western-Style Clothing Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract on April 10th. There are 278 western-style clothing businesses in Beijing. Except for 53 businesses that sell western-style clothing materials on commission, the remaining 225 businesses specialize in handmade clothing. After the liberation of Beijing, due to the fact that this industry does not suit the needs of the majority of the people at present, business has been quite sluggish. After October of last year, it began to improve slightly, but some still need to switch industries. At the beginning of December, labor and management began to deliberate on the establishment of a contract, and after seven consultations, an agreement was finally reached on January 30th.

　　At the signing and approval meeting of the contract, Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the Labor Bureau emphasized in his speech: "Labor-management disputes mostly occur in industries with poor business. In order to seek a reasonable resolution of disputes and overcome current difficulties together, both parties can only conduct democratic consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual concession. The signing of the labor-management collective contract in the western-style clothing industry is in line with this spirit." He hoped that representatives of both parties would widely communicate the content of the contract, and at the same time suggested that labor and management in the industry further organize labor-management consultation meetings on the basis of signing the contract.

　　京西服业签订劳资集体合同
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府劳动局于四月十日正式批准了北京市西服业劳资集体合同。京市西服业共有二百七十八家，除五十三家代卖西服料子外，其余二百二十五家专做手工。北京解放后，由于该业在目前不适合大多数人民的需要，故营业颇为萧条，去年十月以后，始稍有起色，但有的仍需转业。十二月初，劳资双方开始酝酿订立合同，先后经过七次协商，终于在一月三十日获得协议。
    在合同的签字和批准大会上，劳动局马光斗副局长致词时着重指出：“劳资争议多半是发生在营业不好的行业中。为求得纠纷的合理解决共同渡过目前困难，双方只有在互尊互让的基础上，进行民主协商。西服业劳资集体合同的签订，是符合于这一精神的。”他希望双方代表对合同内容进行普遍的传达，同时并建议该业劳资双方在订立合同的基础上，进一步筹组劳资协商会议。
