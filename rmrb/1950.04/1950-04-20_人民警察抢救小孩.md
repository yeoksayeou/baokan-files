　　People's Police Rescue Child
    Comrade Guo Zhaomin, a traffic policeman from the Traffic Second Team of the Seventh Branch Bureau of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, was on duty at the west side of Dongjiaomin Lane at approximately 3:00 PM on the 6th of this month, directing traffic for north-south trams. As a northbound tram was passing, a boy of eight or nine years old was crossing the road from east to west. Despite the traffic policeman's attempts to stop him, the boy suddenly darted onto the tram tracks while the traffic policeman was facing west to direct traffic. The southbound tram braked urgently, but it was too late, and the boy was knocked down. The boy was so frightened that he lay on the tracks, unable to move, and the situation was extremely critical. Traffic policeman Guo Zhaomin, seeing this, rushed forward without hesitation and pulled the child up. At that moment, the tram was still moving forward, knocking Comrade Guo four or five steps away. The tram stopped, and passengers and pedestrians rushed to help them both. Everyone exclaimed, "If it weren't for this traffic policeman's rescue, this child would have lost his life!"

　　人民警察抢救小孩
    北京市公安内七分局交通第二队交通警郭兆敏同志，本月六日下午三时许在东交民巷西值勤放行南北电车时，北行电车正在驶过，有一个八九岁的男孩正由东往西穿行马路，虽经交通警挡阻，但他仍趁交通警面向西指挥车辆时突然偷跑电车轨道当中。往南的电车虽赶紧闸车，但已经来不及了，把小孩撞倒；这个小孩已被吓得躺在轨道上动不了了，情势非常危急。交通警郭兆敏同志一看，毫不迟疑地抢上前去，拉起小孩。那时，电车仍旧在往前动，将郭同志撞出了四五步远。电车静止了，乘客行人都急着来救护他们两人。那时，郭同志仍手拉小孩，两人均未受伤。大家都纷纷的嚷着说：“要不是这个交通警去抢救，这个孩子已经没有命了！”
