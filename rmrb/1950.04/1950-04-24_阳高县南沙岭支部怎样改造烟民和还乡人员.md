The Nansha Ridge Branch in Yanggao County Transforms Smokers and Returned Personnel
    Yu Jun
    Editor's Note: After the land reform, the vast number of farmers urgently demanded a stable social order to carry out a large-scale production campaign. The situation in Nansha Ridge Village, Yanggao, is a good illustration: unless appropriate measures are taken to reform smokers, returned personnel, and other people left over from the old society who do not engage in production and make them participate in labor, not only will the labor force of this group of people not be well utilized, and their livelihood problems cannot be solved, but it will also affect the vast number of masses' ability to develop production with peace of mind. Conversely, after reforming them, not only will society gain a new batch of labor, but it will also stabilize the rural social order and prepare a good social environment for the large-scale production campaign. The Nansha Ridge Village Branch has explored methods for reforming smokers and returned personnel, which are published here for the reference of local Party committees and rural branches.
    The Chinese Communist Party branch in Nansha Ridge Village, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, encountered serious difficulties and obstacles last year in mobilizing the masses to develop a large-scale production campaign. The main reason was the unstable social order, which lowered the enthusiasm of the masses for production. Originally, the social situation in the village was extremely complex. Out of the village's 1,185 people, there were 33 smokers, 41 people who had participated in the Kuomintang (3 people) and reactionary organizations such as the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Comrades Association, nearly 200 people who had participated in feudal reactionary secret societies, and 72 returned personnel who had been sent back home by us after liberation. This group of figures produced and left over by the Kuomintang's long-term reactionary rule, especially a considerable number of smokers and returned personnel among them, not only did not engage in production, but also a few bad elements still did not repent of their past crimes and instead secretly engaged in spreading rumors, inciting discord, and undermining the revolutionary order and production and construction activities. For example, in the autumn of last year, bad elements fabricated rumors such as "There will be another review after autumn" and "The middle peasants will not be touched now, but they will definitely be touched after autumn." These rumors once caused anxiety among the masses and affected the development of autumn plowing. The active leadership of the Communist Party branch and Party members in mass production aroused their jealousy even more, and saboteurs such as Xu Qingguo fabricated rumors that branch secretary Zhu Jian had committed corruption. They even threatened to kill Zhu Jian, and even attempted to buy off Party members to spy on internal Party information in order to carry out threats and inducements, and to sow discord in the relationship between the Party and the masses. The existence and development of these chaotic situations formed a great obstacle to the development of production.
    Combining Persuasion and Coercion, Mobilizing Family Supervision to Prompt Smokers to Quit Voluntarily
    After investigation and understanding of the village's details, the county and district governments arranged for the control, education, and transformation of smokers and returned personnel, and forced them to engage in labor production, in order to eliminate an obstacle to production. After the village branch carried out mobilization and education within the Party, it cooperated with village cadres to carry out publicity for education and transformation of smokers and returned personnel, and purchased a large number of smoking cessation drugs, assisting village cadres in adopting methods of mobilizing persuasion combined with coercion for smokers, so that the six people with the greatest addiction were the first to take smoking cessation drugs. At that time, because the smokers were not aware of the benefits of quitting smoking, many resistance behaviors occurred. For example, the six smokers pretended to be crazy and sick after taking the medicine, crying and shouting, causing unrest in the neighborhood. Some smokers' family members also became concerned. The wife of smoker Zhang Bin said to the cadres: "Although he is a smoker, I still rely on him to live. What if he dies from the treatment!" At this time, Party member cadres told them that the painful manifestations during smoking cessation were a natural phenomenon and would never kill or harm people, and deeply educated them on the close relationship between smoking cessation and their own interests, gradually dispelling the concerns of family members and strengthening their determination and confidence. Sure enough, after a few days, the painful manifestations gradually decreased, and the smokers' mood improved. At this time, the branch immediately proposed the policy of combining production, physical exercise, and restoring health, organizing smokers to collect manure and firewood, mastering from light work to heavy work, from less to more, slowly exercising, and seizing every gap to carry out persuasive education. At the same time, those who worked better and transformed faster were commended and encouraged, using them as the backbone to lead other smokers. In this way, it took more than two months, and all thirty-three smokers in the village, except for two who were still not completely clean due to serious illness, had quit smoking. However, individual cases of secret smoking were later discovered. Therefore, the village branch and the administration constantly held smokers' forums, using the smokers' own recollections of the situation before and after quitting smoking to enlighten and educate the smokers. Such frequent education and supervision prompted them to gradually reach ideological awareness. For example, some smokers later said to Party members: "Before, when you asked me to quit smoking, I couldn't wait to stab you a few times. Now I realize that if it weren't for the Communist Party saving me, I would have starved to death sooner or later." Smokers' family members were also very grateful, saying: "If it weren't for quitting smoking, this year would be the same as in previous years, freezing and starving with them." Making smokers restrain themselves, and smokers' family members actively supervise, so that the work of thoroughly transforming smokers is strongly guaranteed.
  Educate and Transform Returned Personnel  Reflect, Repent, and Labor Production
    At the same time as transforming smokers, the village also carried out the work of educating and transforming returned personnel. During the period of control and education, a special person gave lessons once every seven days, and the returned personnel themselves reported their actions and thoughts every five days. Those with greater past misdeeds had to conduct self-criticism and reflection, and confess their sinful facts at mass meetings. For example, Xu Cunman, who had served as a puppet village chief, confessed to the masses his crimes of embezzling public funds and extorting the masses. This not only enlightened and educated other returned personnel, but also made it easier for the masses to supervise by publicly exposing their sinful facts. When autumn plowing began last year, Party member cadres universally mobilized returned personnel to participate in labor. At this time, Xu Cunman consciously regretted what he had done to the people in the past, and expressed his repentance. Even though he had sores on his body at the time, he took the lead in participating, and actively organized plowing teams, gradually leading all seventy-two returned personnel to participate in different levels of labor in the autumn plowing. Some plowing teams not only plowed their own land, but were also hired to plow for others. This played a certain role in the village's completion of autumn plowing.
  Help Smokers and Returned Personnel  Establish Housework and Solve Difficulties
    In the process of educating and transforming smokers and returned personnel, Party member cadres began to help them establish housework. First, they were given the same share of land and necessary agricultural tools as the farmers, in different times. When winter production began, all Party members in the village were responsible for specific areas, mobilizing them door to door to find ways of production, and enlightening them to use their strengths to carry out winter sideline production. Strict supervision and control were carried out on individuals who were lazy by nature and unwilling to produce. For example, smoker Yang Cheng was mobilized seven times in nine days, and some Party members helped smokers open eight family production meetings. Under such monitoring and urging, all smokers and returned personnel invested in various sideline production activities, some sawing large logs and some teaming up to run transportation. However, some people really lacked capital due to not having a family background before, and Party member cadres did their best to help, such as assisting Xu Qingli in borrowing a cattle set, helping two widows borrow sorghum stalks to weave pot lids, and some Party members personally acted as guarantors to help with loans. Smokers were very touched by the enthusiastic help of Party member cadres.
    After a winter of hard work, with the initial transformation and the improvement of consciousness of smokers and returned personnel, considerable achievements were also obtained in production. For example, smoker Zhang Bin earned seven stones of naked oats in one winter, and his whole family wore new cotton clothes for the winter. Xu Cunman, who worked for a shorter period of time, also earned two stones of rice, and Yang Cheng earned five bolts of cloth. Some people are planning to use the money earned in one winter to buy cattle and make carts. Several people have also married wives and are determined to start a family and build a career.
    This transformation of smokers and returned personnel in the village not only increased a batch of labor in the society and increased production income, but also eliminated the concerns of the vast number of masses who were not at ease in production due to the chaotic social order. A positive atmosphere of getting rich through labor has been established among all the people in the village. Therefore, the achievements of sideline production last winter exceeded those of previous years. More than 30 kinds of sideline production were carried out in the village, earning back 513 stones of grain, and collecting a large amount of fertilizer, and purchasing agricultural tools and livestock, laying a good foundation for this year's large-scale production. At the same time, when collecting autumn public grain last year, the village completed all tasks in two days, and was praised by the county government. The village branch was also awarded as a model branch in the county and district's model branch award movement in July last year.

　　阳高县南沙岭支部怎样改造烟民和还乡人员
    予俊
    编者按：土地改革后广大农民迫切要求社会秩序安定，以开展大生产运动。阳高南沙岭村的情况正是一个很好的说明：不采取适当的措置使烟民、还乡人员以及其他旧社会遗留下来的不务生产的人们改邪归正参加劳动，非但这一部分人的劳力不能很好运用、生活问题无法解决，并且影响广大群众不能安心发展生产。反之，改造了他们以后，不但使社会增加了一批劳力，并且使农村社会秩序安定，为大生产运动准备下良好的社会环境。在改造烟民和还乡人员方面，南沙岭村支部摸索出了办法，特发表供各地党委和农村支部参考。      
    察哈尔省阳高县南沙岭村中共支部，去年在发动群众发展大生产运动中遇到了严重的困难和障碍。主要是因社会秩序不安，广大群众生产情绪不高。原来该村社会情况极为复杂。全村一千一百八十五口人中，有烟民三十三人，参加过国民党（三人）和三青团、同志会等反动组织的共四十一人，参加过封建反动会道门的将近二百人，解放后被我遣散返家的还乡人员七十二人。这样一批为国民党长期反动统治所产生和遗留下来的人物，特别是其中有为数不少的烟民和还乡人员，不但不从事生产，而且有少数坏分子仍不知改悔前非，反在暗地进行造谣、挑拨，破坏革命秩序和生产建设的活动。如在去年秋季坏分子曾制造出“秋后还要复查”、“中农不动，秋后一定动”等谣言。这些谣言曾一度引起群众的不安，影响了秋耕的开展。中共支部和党员积极领导群众生产，更引起他们的忌恨，破坏分子许庆国等就造谣说支部书记朱建同志有贪污行为。并声言要打死朱建，甚至企图收买党员刺探党内消息，以进行威胁利诱，并挑拨离间党群关系。这些混乱情况的存在和发展，形成了发展生产的极大障碍。
  说服结合强制，动员家属监督，促使烟民自觉戒烟
    县、区政府经过调查，了解了该村详情后，就布置了管制教育改造烟民、还乡人员，并强制其劳动生产，以扫除障碍生产的一种阻力。该村支部在党内作了动员教育以后，即配合村干部一面展开教育改造烟民、还乡人员的宣传，一面购买大批戒烟药品，协助村干部对烟民采用动员说服结合强制的方法，使六个烟瘾最大的先吃戒烟药。当时由于烟民未觉悟到戒烟的好处，曾发生了许多抵抗行为。如六个烟民吃药后就装疯装病，大哭大叫，闹得四邻不安。部分烟民家属也由此产生顾虑。烟民张宾老婆向干部说：“虽说他是个烟鬼，可是我还指望他过呢？治死了可怎么办！”这时党员干部便告诉她们戒烟时的痛苦表现是自然现象，决不会治死或治坏人，并以戒烟对她们的切身利害关系进行深刻教育，逐渐打消了家属的顾虑，坚定了她们的决心和信心。果然等了不几天痛苦表现就逐渐减少，烟民情绪好转。这时支部紧接着提出结合生产、锻炼身体，恢复健康的方针，组织烟民拾粪、打柴，在生产中掌握了由轻活到重活，由少到多，慢慢锻炼，并抓紧每一空隙，进行说服教育。同时对劳动较好、转变较快的进行表扬和鼓励，以他们作骨干去带领其他烟民。这样共用了两个多月的时间，全村三十三个烟民，除两个人因病重仍未戒净外，其余全数戒净。但以后又发现个别的人偷吸的现象。因此，该村支部和行政上就不断召开烟民座谈会，以烟民自己回忆戒烟前后的情景来启发教育烟民。这样经常的教育和监督，促使其逐渐达到思想的自觉。如后来有的烟民对党员说：“以前你们叫我戒烟，恨不得扎你们几刀，现在想起来才知道了要不是共产党挽救我，早晚也得饿死。”烟民家属也很感激的说：“要不是戒了烟，今年还不和往年一样跟着他们挨冻挨饿。”作到使烟民自己克制自己，烟民家属也积极监督，使彻底改造烟民的工作得到强有力的保证。
  教育改造还乡人员  反省悔过劳动生产
    与改造烟民同时，该村还进行了教育改造还乡人员的工作。在管制教育时期，每七天有专人上课一次，每五天由还乡人员自己汇报自己的行动和思想情况。过去恶迹较大的须自作检讨和反省，并在群众大会上坦白其罪恶事实。如当过伪村长的许存满即向群众坦白出贪污公款、敲榨群众等罪恶。这样不但给其他还乡人员以启发教育，同时当众揭露其罪恶事实，也便于群众监督。去年秋耕开始，党员干部就普遍动员还乡人员参加劳动。这时许存满自觉过去对不起人民，表示悔过，当时身上长着疮也带头参加了，并积极组织拉犁小组，逐渐带动全体还乡人员七十二人都参加了秋耕中轻重不同的劳动。有的拉犁小组不但耕完了自己的地，还受雇替别人耕种。对该村完成秋耕上曾起了一定作用。
  帮助烟民还乡人员  建立家务解决困难
    在烟民和还乡人员教育改造过程中，党员干部即开始帮助他们建立家务。首先分别先后的分给他们与农民同样一份土地和必要的农具。冬季生产开始，全村党员即分片负责，挨户动员他们寻找生产门路，启发他们各本所长，进行冬季副业生产。对个别懒惰成性、不愿生产的人，则进行严格的监督和管制。如对烟民杨成曾在九天内动员了七次，有的党员曾帮助烟民开过八次家庭生产会。在这样监视督促下，全体烟民和还乡人员投入了各种副业生产活动，有的拉大锯，有的搭伙跑运输。但有些人确实因以前没有家底而缺乏资本，党员干部便尽力帮助，如协助许庆礼借了牛套，帮助两个寡妇借秫秸编锅盖，有的党员则亲自替他们作保帮助借贷。烟民对党员干部这样热心的帮助，非常感动。
    经过一冬的努力，随着烟民和还乡人员的初步改造和觉悟的提高，生产上也获得了可观的成绩。如烟民张宾一冬就赚了七石莜麦，全家人过冬都穿上新棉衣。劳动时间较短的许存满也赚了两石米，杨成赚了五个布。有些人正打算用一冬赚得的钱买牛，制车。有几个还娶下老婆，安心要兴家立业。
    该村这次改造烟民和还乡人员，不仅增加了社会上一批劳动力，增加了生产收益，而且解除了广大群众因社会秩序紊乱而不安心生产的顾虑。全村人民中树立起来了劳动致富的正气。因而去冬副业生产成绩超过往年，全村开展了三十余种副业生产，赚回粮食五百一十三石，并拾粪积了大批肥料，购制了农具、牲口，为今年大生产打下了良好的基础。同时，在去年征收秋季公粮时，该村两天内即全部完成任务，获得了县府的表扬。该村支部在去年七月县区评奖模范支部运动中，亦被评奖为模范支部。
