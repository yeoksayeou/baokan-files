Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th: The Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a conference from March 17th to 25th, gathering 660 cadres from various cities, towns, special districts, key counties, and economic departments at all levels. One of the important contents of the meeting was to convey and discuss the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on unifying national financial and economic work. At the beginning of the meeting, Song Shaowen, Director of the Financial and Economic Planning Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, conveyed the current national financial and economic situation and the tasks of financial and economic work, based on the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the above-mentioned conveyance.

After discussion, the participants established the view that national financial and economic work must be unified, and thus consciously examined the extremely absurd ideas of complaining that "the higher authorities demand too much revenue, while the lower authorities always feel that the higher authorities give too little expenditure," and that one city or town could formulate a "three-year plan" or "five-year plan" and try to achieve economic prosperity in isolation. At the same time, they also strictly examined the idea of not paying attention to tax collection. The meeting also criticized the thinking of only agreeing to the principle of unification while emphasizing the difficulties in implementation, such as the so-called "personnel streamlining will only shrink operations," and "lower-level flexibility is reduced, making work difficult, and we can only write more reports." The meeting pointed out that this was still a reflection of localism. The participants deeply understood from the work inspection that due to localism and bureaucracy, serious phenomena such as waiting for tax payments, misappropriating funds to hoard materials, failing to organize warehouses resulting in damage to property, blind production resulting in cost losses, and certain lack of coordination between departments caused great losses to the country and the people. Therefore, everyone recognized the importance of unification and established the determination to strengthen work and overcome difficulties.

Another content of the meeting was to discuss urban economic work. At the meeting, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a detailed speech on the work program for 1950 and how to carry out urban economic work. The meeting also invited the heads of the Industry and Commerce Bureaus of Beijing and Tianjin to introduce the industrial and commercial situation in Beijing and Tianjin. These discussions were of great help to the participating cadres. Finally, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, made a summary.

The meeting finally determined: First, give play to the spirit of creation, overcome difficulties, oppose dependence, and resolutely implement the specific provisions of the central government's various unifications. Strictly control revenue and expenditure, actively complete tax revenue tasks, ensure that national revenue is promptly deposited into the treasury, focus on the budget and final accounts system, and eliminate the phenomenon of revenue and expenditure disconnection. Implement rectification of establishments, and all unestablished cadres in various places must be concentrated in the province with supply certificates by the end of April. Thoroughly clean up warehouses, practice strict economy, and oppose waste. Second, reorganize local industry, overcome the serious shortcomings of personnel waste, organizational overlap, and the separation of administration and enterprises in industrial organization, starting with the province, abolish the Provincial Industrial Company, and the directly-affiliated factories of the province will be directly led by the Provincial Department of Industry. The publicly-owned factories originally managed by various cities are temporarily designated as provincially-operated and city-managed. Under the centralized leadership of the Department of Industry, accounting should be unified, and the Department of Industry should uniformly control the overall revenue and expenditure of local industry in the province. Warehouse management should be unified, warehouses should be thoroughly cleaned up by the end of June, and surplus materials should be reported to the province for unified allocation. Operations should be unified to get rid of the factory-store style, save manpower, and the mining and marketing business of mines should be handled by trade departments and cooperatives, and no business organizations should be set up unless specifically needed. The supply and marketing offices of the province and cities should be quickly merged into a joint operation of the province and cities. Third, carry out material exchanges, and the state-owned and public-owned trade organizations and cooperatives must be closely integrated to overcome any uncoordinated phenomena, widely sign contracts, and ensure the completion of the currency withdrawal task. To strengthen sales work, retail outlets should be set up in cities, and pilot projects can also be set up in market towns. Fourth, the business operations of cooperatives must be unified, strengthen planning, and the special district and city cooperatives, business, and funds are uniformly allocated by the provincial cooperative. Unity should be strengthened mainly from the planning level below the county level, but accounting units should be retained in order to gradually develop in the direction of mass joint cooperatives.

　　河北召开城市财经会议
    树立财经统一观点  批判本位主义思想
    发挥创造精神克服困难
    【新华社保定四日电】河北省人民政府于三月十七日至二十五日召集了各城、镇、专区、重点县以及各级经济部门干部六百六十余人举行会议。会议的重要内容之一是传达和讨论中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定。会议首由中央人民政府财经委员会财经计划局局长宋劭文，根据政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，传达了目前全国财政经济情况与财经工作任务。会议热烈地讨论了上述传达。
    与会人员经过讨论之后，树立了全国财经工作必须统一的观点，因而自觉地检讨了过去“收入总怨上级要的多，开支总嫌上级给的少”和一个市镇自订“三年计划”、“五年计划”想孤立地达到繁荣经济的极端悖谬的思想；同时，也严格地检讨了不重视税收工作的思想。会议同时批判了只同意统一原则，而强调执行困难，如所谓“人员精简了，只得缩小经营”；“下层机动权小了，工作不好作了，只有多写报告”等类思想。会议指出这仍是本位思想的反映。与会人员从工作检查中深刻地了解到由于本位主义、官僚主义，造成了坐待缴税、挪用资金囤积物资、不整理仓库以致损坏资财、盲目生产以致亏损成本以及各部门间某些互不协调等严重现象，给予了国家人民以极大的损失。因此，大家认识了统一的重要性，树立了加强工作、克服困难的决心。
    会议的另一内容为讨论城镇经济工作。会上，中共河北省委书记林铁就一九五○年工作纲要和如何进行城镇经济工作问题作了详尽的发言。会议并邀请京、津两市工商局负责人介绍了京津工商业情况。这些对与会干部的讨论帮助甚大。会议最后由省人民政府主席杨秀峰作总结。
    会议最后确定：第一、发挥创造精神，克服困难，反对依赖，坚决执行中央各种统一的具体规定。严格掌握收支，积极完成税收任务，保证国家收入及时入库，抓紧预决算制度，杜绝收支脱节现象。实行整顿编制，各地编外干部四月底前一律连同供给证明集中到省。彻底清理仓库，厉行节约，反对浪费。第二、整理地方工业，克服工业组织上人员浪费、组织重叠、行政和企业脱节的严重缺点，先从省作起，撤销省实业公司，省直属工厂改由省工业厅直接领导。原由各市管理的公营工厂，暂定均为省营市管。在工业厅集中领导下，要统一会计，并由工业厅统掌全省地方工业总的收支。要统一仓库管理，六月底前彻底清理仓库，多余物资一律报省统一调拨。要统一经营，摆脱工厂商店化的作风，节省人力，矿厂供销业务统由贸易部门及合作社去作，非特殊必需不设经营机构。省市属各地供销处，迅速合并进行省市联营。第三、开展物资交流，要作到国营、公营贸易机关与合作社密切结合，克服任何互不协调现象，广泛签订合同，保证完成通货回笼任务，就要加强出售工作，城市设零售机构，集镇也可试办。第四、合作社业务经营必须统一，加强计划性，专区与市社，业务、资金均由省社统一调配。县以下主要从计划上加强统一，但保留会计单位，以便逐渐向群众性的联合社方向发展。
