　　Northeast China: 40,000 Railway Employees Study Culture
    Improving Work Efficiency and Promoting Technical Learning
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Over 40,000 railway employees in various parts of Northeast China are participating in spare-time cultural studies. The cultural level of the workers is rapidly improving. At the same time, work has been improved, unity has been strengthened, and technical learning has been promoted. There are currently 180,000 employees on the Northeast Railway, of which about 40 percent are illiterate or semi-literate (50,800 are illiterate). After several years of political enlightenment education since liberation, the workers' class consciousness has been raised. In addition, with work on the right track, most employees demand cultural learning. In Qiqihar, Harbin, and other places, some spare-time schools and literacy classes were opened as early as 1948. Since October last year, the entire railway has begun planned and systematic formal spare-time education. In November, at the joint meeting of heads of cultural and educational departments of trade unions across the railway, it was proposed to carry out a widespread literacy campaign, mainly targeting the engineering departments (because there are more illiterates in this department). It was also decided to pilot formal spare-time schools with a focus. The plan is to eliminate illiteracy among all employees under the age of 45 who started working before 1950 within three years; and to improve the cultural level of employees with lower cultural levels to the level of primary school, higher primary school or junior high school. In the past four months, 122 spare-time schools have been established throughout the railway, with 12,316 primary school students; 3,127 senior primary school students; 1,427 junior high school students; and another 25,225 employees participating in organized study in literacy classes. In total, 42,095 employees across the railway are participating in cultural learning, accounting for 23.4 percent of all employees. Among them, 33,376 were originally illiterate, accounting for more than 60 percent of all illiterates. After this stage of study, the workers participating in spare-time study throughout the railway can recognize at least 50 or 60 characters, and generally can recognize 200 or 300 characters. Some can already write simple letters, wall newspaper drafts, or work diaries. During the Spring Festival, the entire railway rewarded 145 learning models and 117 model teachers.
    According to reports from local trade unions, the implementation of spare-time cultural learning has greatly improved work efficiency. For example, before cultural learning, the loading and unloading workers at Zhalantun Station once proposed "fast loading" and "fast unloading." At that time, because the workers were illiterate, they often unloaded the goods from Zhalainuoer in Zhalantun; otherwise, they had to wait for literate people to identify the "feizi" (labels) before they could load and unload. Later, after the loading and unloading workers studied in the literacy class and recognized the names of the stations along the line, the goods that used to take 15 minutes to unload now only take six or seven minutes. The incidents of incorrectly tying "feizi" and incorrectly transporting goods have also disappeared. All employees of the Boketu Telegraph Section participated in cultural learning, which played a significant role in the section's completion of 222 percent of the annual work task last year. At the same time, organizing cultural learning has also increased the unity of employees. Most of the current 1,334 spare-time teachers on the entire railway are on-site staff. In the process of teaching, the relationship with the workers is closer. The workers often praised the good teachers: "We must study hard and not waste the teacher's kindness." Once, Zhang Suzhen, a teacher at the Changchun Spare-time School, went to the club to attend a party and there were no seats. The workers scrambled to give her seats. In addition, in Qiqihar, Jilin, and other places, workers stipulated cultural learning in their apprenticeship contracts, which promoted technical learning. For example, after female worker Gao Yaqin of the Boketu Telegraph Section signed an apprenticeship contract with veteran technician Li Dequan, Li Dequan taught Gao Yaqin technical skills every day; Gao Yaqin taught Li Dequan culture. Now Li Dequan knows more than 700 characters, and Gao Yaqin has learned to repair telephones.
    In order to summarize and check the educational work at this stage and to arrange future work, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions convened a railway-wide education work conference on March 25. At the meeting, various regions reported on the situation, exchanged experiences, and adopted the implementation measures for establishing formal spare-time schools, preparing to consolidate the existing spare-time schools on the one hand; and improving the literacy classes in various places to gradually combine them with the education of formal spare-time schools.

### 东北四万铁路员工学习文化  提高了工作效率推进了技术学习

　　东北四万铁路员工学习文化
    提高了工作效率推进了技术学习
    【本报讯】东北铁路各地员工已有四万余人参加业余文化学习。工人们的文化程度正迅速提高，同时，也改进了工作，加强了团结，推进了技术学习。东北铁路现有员工共十八万名，其中文盲、半文盲约占百分之四十（文盲为五万零八百人），经过解放后几年来的政治启蒙教育，工人们的阶级觉悟提高；加以工作走上正轨，一般员工均要求文化学习。在齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨等地，远在一九四八年就开办了一些业余学校和识字班。去年十月起，全路开始了有计划有步骤的正规业余教育。十一月，在全路各工会文教部长联席会上，提出了以工务部门为主要对象（因该部门文盲较多），普遍开展识字运动。并决定有重点地试办正规业余学校。计划在三年以内，扫除所有一九五○年前上班的四十五岁以下的员工中的文盲；并将文化较低的员工分别提高到初小、高小或初中程度。四个月来，全路已建立业余学校一二二所，计有初小学员一二、三一六名；高小学员三、一二七名；初中学员一、四二七名；另有二五、二二五名员工在识字班进行有组织的学习。总计全路参加文化学习的员工共四二、○九五名，占全路员工的百分之二三点四。其中原为文盲者计三三、三七六名，占全部文盲的百分之六十强。经过此一阶段的学习，全路参加业余学习的工人，最少的能认五、六十个字，一般能认二、三百字，有的已能写简单书信、墙报稿、或工作日记。春节期间，全路奖励了学习模范一四五名，模范教员一一七名。
    据各地工会汇报，业余文化学习的进行，大大提高了工作效率。如札兰屯站的装卸工，在未进行文化学习前曾提出“快装”“快卸”，当时因工人不识字，往往把札赉诺尔的货物卸到札兰屯；否则就得等识字的人认清“飞子”（标签）后才能装卸。后来装卸工经过识字班学习，认得了沿线站名，过去要十五分钟卸完的货物，现在只需六七分钟了。“飞子”拴错、货物运错的事也绝迹了。博克图电务段全体员工都参加了文化学习，对该段去年完成全年工作任务的百分之二二二的成绩起了很大作用。同时，组织文化学习也增进了员工的团结。全路现有的一、三三四位业余教员，大部分是现场的职员。在教学的过程中与工人的关系更密切了。工人们常常赞扬好的老师：“可得好好学，不白瞎老师好心。”有一次，长春业余学校教员张素珍到俱乐部去参加晚会，没有座位，工人们争着让位子给她。此外，在齐齐哈尔、吉林等处，工人们订立师徒合同时，包括了文化学习在内，对技术学习起了推动作用。如博克图电务段女工高雅琴与老技工李德全订了师徒合同后，李德全每天教高雅琴学技术；高雅琴则教李德全学文化。现在李德全认识了七百多字，高雅琴学会了修电话机。
    为总结检查此一阶段的教育工作及布置今后工作，东北铁路总工会文教部于三月二十五日召开了全路教育工作会议。会上，各地区汇报了情况，交流了经验，并通过了建立正规业余学校实施办法，准备一面巩固已有业余学校；一面提高各地的识字班，使之逐渐与正规业余学校的教育相结合。（中国铁路工会全国委员会）
