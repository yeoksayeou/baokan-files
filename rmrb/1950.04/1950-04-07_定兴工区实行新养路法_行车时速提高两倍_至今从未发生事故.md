　　Dingxing Work Zone Implements New Road Maintenance Method
    Train Speed Doubles, No Accidents to Date
    Awarded the Title of Model Track Team by Tianjin Railway Bureau

    [This newspaper's Baoding dispatch] Reporter Lü Guangming reports: Since the Dingxing Work Zone on the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway began piloting the new road maintenance method on September 13th of last year, train speeds have twice jumped from 20 kilometers per hour to 60 kilometers per hour. To date, no accidents have occurred, ensuring the safety of train operations. This excellent achievement is the result of the active efforts of all workers under the leadership of foreman Wang Sheng-san. Therefore, when the Tianjin Railway Bureau held a celebration meeting in January, Wang Sheng-san was awarded the title of First-Class Meritorious Worker, and the track team was awarded the title of Model Track Team.
    The track team was established on April 15th of last year. At that time, the entire team had only twelve people, which increased to twenty-two by July. In completing the arduous tasks of autumn maintenance (i.e., routine repairs) and major repairs, the workers demonstrated a high degree of selfless and active work spirit, patrolling day and night and rushing to repair dangerous areas, ensuring the safety of train operations during the summer and autumn rainy seasons. The train speed increased from 20 kilometers per hour to 35 kilometers per hour, and the autumn maintenance plan was completed half a month ahead of schedule. In order to further strengthen the work of maintaining the line, foreman Wang Sheng-san also accepted the spirit of the "new direction of road maintenance." Based on past work, and after full discussion and research, the responsibility system of track maintenance was piloted on September 13th of last year. According to the nature of the work, the entire team was divided into three work groups, responsible for creeping correction and pile driving, track shifting and realignment, and track raising and tamping projects. Before construction, engineering plans and discipline were formulated through democratic discussion, engineering standards were strictly enforced, and repair work was gradually promoted from one end of the project to the other. This completely overcame the past phenomenon of being completely passive, unplanned, and addressing problems only when they arose. Under the active leadership of foreman Wang Sheng-san, and through the efforts of all workers, the major repair project of eight kilometers of track in the entire work zone was completed by the end of last October, enabling the train speed to once again jump from 35 kilometers per hour to 60 kilometers per hour. Since the implementation of the responsibility system, the workers' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility have increased, which has not only improved the quality of construction, but also paid more attention to preventing accidents. For example, in December of last year, track patrol worker Bai Shan discovered that the inner and outer parallel fishplates on a track at 93 kilometers and 500 meters were broken. He immediately cleverly removed a fishplate from another track and installed it on the broken fishplate rail, saving the train from danger. As a result of the workers' attention to improving technology and actively studying, the team's imitation of the "clearance correction device" has been successful, increasing the efficiency of restoring the normal clearance of the steel rails by one and a half times. They also created the "safety rail tie rod," which allows the switch rails to maintain a normal standard gauge, saving man-hours and materials, and extending the life of the sleepers.
    In February of this year, after the track team sent seven workers to Changxindian and Tianjin to study road maintenance techniques, they immediately formally implemented the new road maintenance method on March 17th, implementing the "three guarantees" responsibility system—guaranteeing repair, guaranteeing maintenance, and guaranteeing inspection. The entire track team of nineteen workers was divided into a ten-person repair team, a five-person maintenance team, and a three-person inspection team, with one person in charge of odd jobs and duty. The repair team takes each kilometer as a construction unit and carries out thorough repair step by step every day according to a certain plan and work sequence. As of February 29th, after thirteen days of hard work, the repair project of the first kilometer has been completed. After being inspected and qualified by the Changxindian Engineering Section, it has now been handed over to the maintenance team for maintenance. The repair of the second kilometer began on March 30th. According to foreman Wang Sheng-san, if the railway bureau provides anti-creep devices, the train speed in the work zone can be guaranteed to increase to 80 kilometers per hour after another round of repairs.

### 定兴工区实行新养路法  行车时速提高两倍  至今从未发生事故

　　定兴工区实行新养路法
    行车时速提高两倍  至今从未发生事故
    荣获天津路局模范道班称号                                
    【本报保定特讯】记者吕光明报道：京汉铁路北段定兴工区从去年九月十三日试行新养路法以来，行车时速由二十公里两次跃升至六十公里，迄今从未发生任何事故，保证了行车安全。这种优异成绩，是该工区王省三工长领导全体工友积极努力的结果。因此，天津铁路局一月份举行庆功大会时，王省三荣获一等功臣，该道班得模范道班的称号。
    该道班自去年四月十五日成立，当时全班仅有十二人，至七月间增为二十二人。在完成秋季维修（即经常补修）及大修的艰巨任务中，工友们表现了高度忘我的积极工作精神，昼夜巡逻与抢修险工，保证了夏秋雨季的行车安全，行车时速由二十公里跃升至三十五公里，且提前半月完成秋季维修计划。为进一步加强养护线路工作，王省三工长又接受了“养路新方向”的精神，在过去的工作基础上，又经过充分地讨论和研究，于去年九月十三日开始试行工务养路负责制。按工作性质，把全班分成三个工组，分别负责爬行整正打桩、拨道改道、起道捣固工程。施工前经过民主讨论，制订工程计划和纪律、严格工程标准，从工程的一端开始向另一端逐步推行修养工作。完全克服了过去完全处于被动状态的、无计划的、头痛医头脚痛医脚的现象。在王省三工长的积极领导之下，经全组工友的努力，至去年十月底即完成了全工区八公里线路的大修工程，使行车时速由三十五公里再次跃升至六十公里。自实行负责制以来，工友们的积极性和责任心提高了，不仅提高了施工质量，且多方注意防止事故的发生。如去年腊月间，巡道工白山在九十三公里五百公尺处发现一条轨道上内外平行夹板均已折断，他立即机智的从另一条轨道上卸下一块鱼尾板装到折断夹板的铁轨上，列车得以免出危险。由于工友们注意提高技术，积极钻研的结果，该班仿造“游间整正器”已经成功，使恢复钢轨正常游间的工作效率提高一倍半。他们并创造了“安全轨系杆”，使道岔钢轨可保持正常标准轨距，既节省工时、工料，又可延长枕木寿命。
    今年二月间，该道班抽出七名工友去长辛店、天津两地学习养路技术归来后，当即于三月十七日正式推行新养路法，实行三包——包修、包养、包检——负责制。全道班十九个工友分组成十个人的包修班、五个人的包养班，三个人的包检班，另有一个人打杂值日。包修班以每公里作一施工单位，每天按照一定计划，工作顺序，逐步彻底包修。截至二月二十九日止，经十三天努力，已完成第一个公里的包修工程。经长辛店工务段检查合格后，现已交包养班负责包养。第二个公里的包修，已于三月三十日开始。据王省三工长向记者表示：如路局给予防爬器的装备，经过再一次的包修后，该工区行车时速保证可提高到八十公里。
