Guangdong's Sugar Industry
    By our Special Correspondent Wang Kuang

            I
    Guangdong, located in the subtropics, with its high temperatures and abundant rainfall, is suitable for sugarcane cultivation and is the main sugar-producing area in the country. The province's sugarcane planting area is over 900,000 mu. Among them, Dongguan, Heyuan, Huiyang, Jieyang, and Chaoyang counties account for approximately 550,000 mu; Boluo, Qingyuan, Huaxian, Hepu, and Qin County account for over 60,000 mu; Xuwen, Haikang, and Suixi counties account for over 120,000 mu; and Ruyuan, Qujiang, Lianjiang, Chenghai, Xingning, and Luoding counties together account for over 200,000 mu; Hainan Island accounts for 80,000 mu.  Assuming an average yield of 60 dan per mu (with a maximum yield of over 100 dan), the annual production of sugarcane could reach 2.7 million tons, yielding 200,000 tons of cane sugar annually.

    In the Pearl River Delta region, namely Shunde, Zhongshan, Panyu, Nanhai, Dongguan, and other counties, the sugarcane planting area generally exceeds 100,000 mu, with an annual sugarcane production of over 100,000 tons. In some counties, such as Shunde, the total area is 686,230 mu, with sugarcane fields accounting for 230,000 mu (other rice paddies 200,000 mu, mulberry dikes 150,000 mu, fish ponds 100,622 mu), accounting for 33% of the total cultivated land, becoming the main source of income for farmers. It is estimated that in the delta, hundreds of thousands of farmers and tens of thousands of sugar workers rely on sugarcane and sugar for their livelihood. Therefore, the sugar industry is not only an economic issue but also a rural social issue.

            II
    In the past, Guangdong's sugar industry faced several serious problems:

    The first was weak productivity. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, Guangdong had six modern mechanized sugar factories: Shitou, Shunde, Huiyang, Jieyang, Dongguan, and Xinzhao. The crushing capacity was 5,500 tons, and based on a sugar production rate of 8% to 10%, the annual sugar production over four months would be 59,400 tons. Considering the province's annual production of 2.7 million tons of sugarcane, less than a quarter was processed by machine. Moreover, the actual crushing capacity of the aforementioned factories was much lower than estimated. For example, sugar production was 21,000 tons in 1935, 11,800 tons in 1936, and 8,400 tons in 1943, far from the figure of 59,400 tons. During the Japanese occupation, some of the machinery was dismantled or destroyed by the Japanese, leaving only the Dongguan and Shunde factories, with an annual sugar production of only 500,000 dan. After the Japanese surrender, the Dongguan factory was controlled by bureaucratic capitalists, and the Shunde factory was owned by the "Guangdong Industrial Company," with an average annual sugar production of only around 6,000 tons, which was pitifully small. Therefore, the vast majority of sugarcane production was used for crude sugar production, resulting in a significant waste of sugarcane and a reduction in yield. In addition, with the continuous closure of crude sugar factories, much sugarcane still could not find a market.

    Second, sugarcane farmers were subjected to excessive exploitation, leading to the gradual depletion of raw material sources. Sugarcane farmers were first exploited by the large sugar factories. The large factories were mostly controlled by big bureaucrats and local despots (such as Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing), who stipulated low prices to force the purchase of sugarcane farmers' products and also demarcated areas and set deadlines for sales. However, at the same time, due to the limited amount of sugarcane needed by the factories, they adopted a quota allocation method. Only those who were allocated a quota could sell their sugarcane; those who were not could not sell it. Thus, corruption and irregularities emerged one after another, and most of the quotas were bought by dummy sugarcane merchants, who then sold them to sugarcane farmers, resulting in another layer of exploitation. In addition, sugarcane farmers were also subjected to exploitation by "Da Tian Er" (bandits). These bandits controlled the transport boats on the large and small rivers, and no sugarcane could be transported without their permission.

    Under such circumstances of heavy exploitation, all measures, whether pre-ordering sugarcane from farmers or providing loans, had to go through several twists and turns, ultimately becoming acts of exploitation.

    In the midst of the unbearable exploited life, sugarcane farmers did not put effort into sugarcane cultivation (no fertilization, no pest control), and the quality of the product declined year by year. The sugar content also decreased significantly (from 13%-14% to between 10%-12%), making it impossible for the sugar factories to obtain standard raw materials (especially for mechanized sugar factories, the supply of a certain amount and quality of high-quality sugarcane was extremely lacking). Some sugarcane farmers even left the sugarcane growing in the fields without cutting it, some cut it down and threw it into fish ponds, and some dried it and used it as firewood, and this number was not small every year. It is estimated that even this year, there are about 170,000 tons in the Pearl River Delta alone.

    Third, the sales problem of sugar could not be solved. Although Guangdong is an important sugar market, it often could not sell its sugar under the dumping of foreign sugar. Foreign sugar had lower costs and better quality, making it difficult for many crude sugar factories to compete, and even modern mechanized sugar factories could not resist it. Other regions, due to the war, had disrupted north-south transportation. Even if it was accessible, foreign sugar would also arrive there, so a large number of products had no outlet, causing many sugar factories to shut down.

    This is a picture of the past decline of Guangdong's sugar industry.

            III
    Since liberation, some major problems in Guangdong's sugar industry have been initially resolved.

    For example, the sugarcane farmers now directly deliver their sugarcane, and the former dummy sugarcane merchants have been abolished. The sugarcane farmers themselves organize farmers' associations and, through the relationships of the farmers' associations, allocate quotas, basically eliminating the exploitation of dummy sugarcane merchants and "Da Tian Er," and the sugarcane farmers' morale has been greatly improved. In the past, sugarcane farmers could only exchange 4 dan and 20 jin of rice for 100 dan of sugarcane from sugarcane merchants, but now they can exchange 8 dan and 40 jin of rice by delivering it directly to the factory, doubling their income. This not only guarantees the interests of sugarcane farmers but also guarantees the supply of raw materials to sugar factories.

    In terms of mechanized sugar factories, the Dongguan and Shunde factories were taken over by the People's Government and quickly started operations (the Shitou factory is under construction). Due to the workers' high production morale, productivity has greatly increased. For example, the sugarcane crushing volume of the Dongguan factory can reach a maximum record of 1,100 tons per day, an increase of 50% compared to the 550 to 800 tons in the same period in previous years. The sugar content has also increased from 6.32 jin of sugar per dan in the same period of previous years to 6.85 jin. Based on an average of 900 tons crushed per day, more than 4,660 jin of sugar can be obtained each day. Comparing the production figures of the Shunde factory in January, this year's production increased by 56.95% compared to last year. Last January, 19,004 bags of granulated sugar were produced, and this January, 30,032 bags were produced, an increase of 58.03%. The factory's sugarcane crushing volume has also increased from 1,100 tons per day to 1,325 tons, breaking the highest sugarcane crushing record in the 15 years since the factory was built. This year, the Dongguan and Shunde factories plan to produce 20,000 tons of granulated sugar (equivalent to the total actual production of the five factories before the War of Resistance). If the source of raw materials is not hindered, this task can be accomplished.

    As for the sales problem of products, the People's Government has conducted planned trade controls, and with the opening of the Yuehan, Yuehu, and Yuegui railways, it has been basically resolved.

    Naturally, in general, only a part of the problems have been initially resolved. Currently, Guangdong's sugar industry still faces serious problems. For example, in the Pearl River Delta's sugar industry, the following problems need to be solved urgently:

    1. The quality of raw materials is too poor, the sugar yield is low, the cost is too high, and the supply of standard raw materials is insufficient. Due to the farmers' inability to fertilize the sugarcane fields before liberation, not planting "new heads," not weeding, and letting them grow on their own, and also because of the "West Water" flood this year, this year's sugarcane yield has been greatly reduced compared to last year, and the quality has also been greatly reduced. According to experts' estimates, this year's yield in Shunde County is only between 4,000 and 5,000 jin on average, and only 6.9 jin of sugar can be extracted per dan of sugarcane (last year it was over 7 jin).

    2. Productivity is still a major problem. Although this year's yield is lower, the lowest estimate is about 60% of last year's. Although the crushing capacity after liberation (state-owned sugar factories) has greatly increased, the number of factories has decreased, and the machinery has been damaged. Therefore, productivity is still a problem. Taking Shunde as an example, the county can produce 9 million to 10 million dan of sugarcane this year, but there are about 50 crude sugar factories in the county, and the state-owned Shunde and Dongguan factories (although the Dongguan factory is in Dongguan, almost all of its raw materials come from Shunde) can crush about 4.52 million dan. The other 5.5 million dan need to be processed by crude sugar factories. However, among the 50 crude sugar factories, only 80% are actually operating (some cannot operate this year due to past losses), and some of them have stopped operating after starting. It is estimated that at most they can crush 2.5 million dan, together with the state-owned sugar factories, totaling 7 million dan, leaving 2 million to 3 million dan of sugarcane without an outlet.

    In addition, many farmers' associations are still controlled by bandits and local despots, and sugarcane farmers still have considerable concerns, etc.

    To solve the above problems, it is necessary to: 1. Eliminate bandits and local despots, solve the land problem, thoroughly eliminate the exploitation of sugarcane farmers, and guarantee the interests of sugarcane farmers, which is also guaranteeing the supply of raw materials. 2. Restore the original mechanized sugar factories, support large and small sugar factories with a capacity of less than 100 tons, and help them start operations. 3. Promptly issue agricultural loans, which is an urgent measure to relieve sugarcane farmers and guarantee the source of sugarcane next year. 4. Improve sugar production technology, reduce costs, and adjust sales channels.

　　广东的制糖工业
    本报特约记者  王匡
            一
    广东地处亚热带，高温多雨，地宜种蔗，为全国主要产糖区。全省种蔗面积，约在九十万亩以上。其中：东莞、河源、惠阳、揭阳、潮阳各县共约占五十五万亩，博罗、清远、花县、合浦、钦县共占六万余亩，徐闻、海康、遂溪三县约十二万余亩，乳源、曲江、廉江、澄海、兴宁、罗定各县合占二十余万亩，海南岛共八万余亩。以每亩产六○担（最高产额为百余担）计算，年可产二百七十万吨甘蔗，每年可产二十万吨蔗糖。
    在珠江三角洲地区，即顺德、中山、番禺、南海、东莞等县，种蔗面积一般都在十万亩以上，年产甘蔗十万余吨。有些县份如顺德县，全县面积六八六、二三○亩，蔗地占了二三○、○○○亩（其他稻田二○○、○○○亩，桑基一五○、○○○亩，鱼塘一○○、六二二亩），合全部耕地面积的百分之三十三，成为农民的主要收入。据估计，在三角洲，有几十万的农民和成万的制糖工人，靠蔗糖生活。因此，糖业问题不但是个经济问题，而且还是个农村社会问题。
            二
    在过去，广东的糖业，存在着几个严重的问题：
    第一个是生产力太弱。抗战前广东的新式机制糖厂有市头、顺德、惠阳、揭阳、东莞、新造六所。压榨能力有五千五百吨，产糖率按百分之八至十计，每年制糖四个月，则年产五九、四○○吨糖。如以全省年产二百七十万吨甘蔗计算，供机器制糖用的还不到全产量的四分之一。而且以上各厂的压榨能力，实际上较估计低得多，如一九三五年产糖为二一、○○○吨，一九三六年为一一、八○○吨，一九四三年为八、四○○吨，距五九、四○○吨的数字相差甚远。到日寇侵陷时期，一部分机器被日寇拆走或炸坏，剩下东莞、顺德二厂，年仅产糖五十万担。日寇投降后，东莞厂被官僚资本把持，顺德厂归“广东实业公司”所有，年产糖平均只在六千吨上下，这更是微少得可怜了。故甘蔗产量的绝大部分，都由土制糖去制造，这样就造成大批的甘蔗的浪费与产量的减缩，加之土制糖厂不断的倒闭，很多的甘蔗依然找不到出路。
    第二、是蔗农受剥削太重，致使原料来源逐渐衰竭。蔗农首先受到大制糖厂厂方的剥削。大厂多为大官僚和土霸王（如余汉谋、李扬敬）所把持，他们规定贱价强迫购入蔗农的产品，而且划定范围，限期出售。但同时又因厂方所需蔗量所限，因而又采取分配户额的办法，配到户额的，才能把蔗售出，配不到户额的便无法售出。于是，营私舞弊，层出不穷，大部户额都给空头蔗商买去，再由他们卖配给蔗户，中间又经过了一层剥削。此外，蔗农还要受到“大天二”（土匪）的剥削，这些土匪控制了大小河流的运输船只，不经过他，甘蔗一根也不让运走。
    在这种重重剥削的情形下，无论向蔗农预约买蔗，或蔗农贷款等一切措施，都必须经过数次转折，结果都成了剥削行为。
    蔗农在困苦不堪的被剥削的生活中，对甘蔗的栽培便不下工夫（不施肥、驱虫），产品的质量也就一年年的低落下去。含糖成分也大为减少（由百分之十三——十四，减低至十——十二之间），使糖厂合乎标准的原料，无法供应（特别是机制糖厂，一定时期一定数量和质地优良的甘蔗供应极感缺少）。有的蔗农甚至让甘蔗长在田里不去砍它，有的砍下来丢到鱼塘里去，有的晒干了拿来当柴烧，而且这个数目字，每年还不小。据估计，直到今年，单三角洲就有十七万吨左右。
    第三是糖的销路问题无法解决。广东虽然是糖的重要市场，但在外糖的倾销下，常常卖不出去，洋糖的成本低，质量又好，不但很多土制糖厂难与抗衡，即新式机制糖厂也抵挡不住。其他各地，由于战争关系，南北交通阻断，即能疏达，洋糖也会到达那里，因此大批产品没有出路，致使很多糖厂停工。
    这是过去广东糖业的一幅凋零图画。
            三
    解放后的广东制糖业，有些重大问题，已获初步解决。
    如实行蔗农交蔗，取消了过去的空头蔗户，由蔗农自己组织农会，经过农会的关系去分配户额，基本上消除空头蔗商与“大天二”的剥削，蔗农的情绪也大大的提高了。过去蔗农交百担蔗给蔗商，只能换到四担二十斤米，现在直接交给厂方，可换到八担四十斤米了，收入增加了一倍。这样既保证了蔗农的利益，同时又保证了糖厂原料的供应。
    在机制糖厂方面，东莞，顺德两厂由人民政府接管后，迅速开工（市头厂正修建中）。由于工人的生产情绪高涨，生产力大为提高，如东莞厂的榨蔗量，每日可达一千一百吨的最高纪录，比往年同一时期的五百五十至八百吨之间，增加了百分之五十。含糖量也较往年的同一时期的每担取糖六·三二斤，增至六·八五斤，以平均每日榨九百吨计算，每日可多得四千六百六十多斤糖。从顺德厂一月份的生产数字比较上看，今年比去年，增加了百分之五六·九五；去年一月制成砂糖一九、○○四包，今年一月产三○、○三二包，增加了百分之五八·○三。现该厂的榨蔗量，且由每天一千一百吨直升至一、三二五吨。打破了建厂十五年来的榨蔗最高纪录。今年东、顺两厂拟生产二万吨砂糖（相当于抗战前五个厂的实际产量的总和）。如果原料来源不受阻滞的话，当可完成此项任务。
    至于产品的销路问题，已由人民政府有计划的进行贸易管制，加之粤汉、粤沪、粤桂等铁路的通车，已基本得到解决。
    自然，总的说来，这只是初步解决了一部分问题。目前广东的制糖业依然存在着严重的问题。例如，珠江三角洲的糖业来说，即有以下几个问题急待解决：
    一、原料质量太差，得糖量少，成本太贵，合乎标准的原料不够供给。由于解放前农民对蔗地无力上肥，不种“新头”，不去锄草上工，任其自生自长，又加上今年“西水”淹了一次，今年的蔗量比去年大为减少，同时在品质上也大为降低。据专家的估计，今年顺德县的产量，平均只在四千至五千斤之间，每担蔗只出糖六·九斤（去年到七斤以上）。
    二、生产力依然是个大问题。今年产量虽然少了，但最低的估计约等于去年的六成。解放后的压榨力（公营糖厂）虽然大大的提高了，但工厂减少，机器损坏，因此生产力仍然是个问题。还以顺德为例，该县今年可产甘蔗九百万到一千万市担，但全县土榨糖厂约五十间，公营的有顺德及东莞厂（东莞厂虽然在东莞，但原料差不多完全由顺德来），两厂约能榨去四百五十二万市担之谱，其他五百五十万担则需由土榨负担。但五十家土榨厂中，实际开工的只有十分之八（有一部分因过去亏本，今年不能开工），而其中有些厂则开后又停了工，估计充其量也只能压榨二百五十万市担，连同公营糖厂合起来，共为七百万市担，还有二百万到三百万担的蔗尚无出路。
    此外，有很多农会仍为土匪恶霸所把持，蔗农还有相当大的顾虑等。
    要解决上述各项问题，则须：一、肃清土匪恶霸，解决土地问题，彻底解除蔗农的剥削，保证蔗农的利益同时也就是保证原料的供给。二、恢复原有的机制糖厂，扶助百吨以下的大小糖厂，帮助他们开工。三、从速发放农贷，这是目前救济蔗农和保证明年蔗源的一项紧急措施。四、提高制糖技术，减低成本，调剂销路。
