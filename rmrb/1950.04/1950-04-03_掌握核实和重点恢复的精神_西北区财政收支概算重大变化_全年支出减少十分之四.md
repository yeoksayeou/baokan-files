　　Mastering the Spirit of Verification and Focused Recovery
    Significant Changes in the Northwest Region's Budget Estimates for Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure
    Total Annual Expenditures Reduced by Four-Tenths
    Serious and Conscientious, Thrifty Calculation: Provinces and Cities Guarantee Full Implementation
    [This newspaper, Xi'an News] Special Correspondent Lin Wei reports: The Northwest Administrative Region's 1950 budget estimates for fiscal revenue and expenditure have undergone significant changes following the fiscal conference in mid-March. Compared to the initial full-year budget made at the beginning of the year, the newly revised full-year budget has reduced expenditures by more than 40%. Among these, military expenditures were reduced by approximately 29%, administrative expenses by approximately 50%, operating expenses (including economic construction, cultural and educational health, welfare relief, and municipal construction) by approximately 75%, and reserve funds by approximately 80%. On the revenue side, there was also an increase of approximately 8%. Among these, public grain revenue increased by approximately 5%, tax revenue increased by approximately 6.5%, and profits and depreciation revenue from state-owned enterprises have also been formally included in the budget (the old budget did not include this revenue). As a result, the fiscal deficit has been reduced from the original 70% to 40%. In other words, the Northwest was originally only 30% self-sufficient, and now it can be 60% self-sufficient. The most important factor contributing to such a significant change in the balance of revenue and expenditure is that, after preliminary reorganization and verification, the number of troops and local personnel has been reduced by more than 20%. Another important factor is that, according to the spirit of "focused recovery," distinguishing between priorities and opposing starting everything at once, operating expenses have been greatly reduced. For example, it has been decided to suspend or temporarily simplify the construction of some relatively less important roads, bridges, culverts, power plants, and other projects.
    When formulating this budget, the Northwest Region's financial and economic cadres demonstrated a full sense of seriousness, conscientiousness, and thrifty calculation. In the past, when allocating public grain and tax tasks, the general attitude of some responsible cadres in the provinces and cities was to undertake them at the meeting first; after returning, they would complete them if conditions were favorable, and if not, they would change the decision and reduce or exempt grain taxes based on so-called "specific circumstances," resulting in many cases of failure to complete the tasks on time. Last autumn, the Northwest's public grain task was originally set at nearly 1.5 billion jin, but the total allocated by the provinces and cities was less than 1.2 billion jin. Even according to the latter figure, approximately 30% has not yet been put into storage. Tax revenue tasks have also not been fully completed. When budgeting expenditures, units generally increased their budgets, some by as much as several times. In addition, many received and confiscated materials were not handed over, and many units accumulated a large amount of grain, funds, and materials, with some storing up to thousands of dan of grain. This also fueled the development of extravagance and waste. This time, after in-depth ideological mobilization, promoting democracy, conducting criticism and self-criticism at the fiscal conference, achieving ideological unity, and then meticulously calculating, the fiscal tasks were determined. The Northwest Region's financial and economic cadres are full of confidence and express unconditional support for the spirit of the central government's February fiscal conference and the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work. They are determined to make their utmost efforts to resolutely realize the Northwest Administrative Region's budget estimates for fiscal revenue and expenditure.

### 掌握核实和重点恢复的精神  西北区财政收支概算重大变化  全年支出减少十分之四

　　掌握核实和重点恢复的精神
    西北区财政收支概算重大变化
    全年支出减少十分之四
    严肃认真、精打细算  各省市保证全部执行
    【本报西安讯】特派记者林韦报道：西北行政区一九五○年的财政收支概算经过三月中旬的财政会议已发生了巨大的变化。与年初第一次所做的全年概算相比，这次重新制定的全年概算在支出方面减少了百分之四十以上。其中军事费约减百分之二九，行政费约减百分之五十，事业费（包括经济建设、文教卫生、抚恤救济与市政建设等）约减百分之七五，预备费约减百分之八十。收入方面，也增加了约百分之八。其中公粮收入约增百分之五，税收约增百分之六·五，公营企业的利润与折旧收入也已正式列入概算（旧概算不包括此项收入）。这样，财政赤字也从原来的百分之七十减至百分之四十。就是说，原来西北只能自给百分之三十，现在已能自给百分之六十。使收支对比发生如此巨大变化的最重要因素，一个是经过初步整编核实，部队与地方人员减少了百分之二十以上。另一重要因素，是根据“重点恢复”的精神，区别轻重缓急，反对百废俱举，因而大大缩减了事业费。比如若干比较次要的公路、桥梁、涵洞、电厂等工程，即决定暂停修建或简修暂用。
    西北区财经负责干部在制定这一概算时，表现了充分的严肃认真、精打细算的负责精神。过去在分配公粮税收等任务时，各省市有些负责干部的一般态度是先在会议上承担起来；回去以后，条件顺利的就完成了，不顺利的，即根据所谓“具体情况”，改变决定，减免粮税，因而到期完不成任务的情形很多。去秋西北公粮任务原来布置了近十五亿斤，各省市布置下去的总共不到十二亿斤。即依后一数字检查，也还有约百分之三十至今未能入仓。税收任务，亦未全部完成。预算支出时，各单位一般都是加大预算。有的多至好几倍。再加上许多接收、缴获物资没有上交，不少单位积存了许多粮款物资，有的存粮达数千石。这样也助长了铺张浪费的发展。这一次，经过深入的思想动员，发扬民主，在财政会议上开展了批评和自我批评，思想上取得一致，然后又经过细密计算确定了财政任务。西北区财经负责干部充满信心，表示无条件的拥护中央二月份财政会议的精神与政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定。决以最大的努力坚决实现西北行政区财政收支概算。
