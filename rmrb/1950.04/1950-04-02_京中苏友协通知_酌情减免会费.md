【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】Regarding the issue of membership fee payments by members of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, it was previously decided that members unable to pay membership fees could apply for a reduction or exemption according to the regulations. However, it has recently been heard that some branches are still collecting membership fees from members unable to pay. Therefore, at the branch joint meeting on April 1st, the Municipal Friendship Association once again notified that all levels of branches should reduce or exempt membership fees for members unable to pay (such as farmers with no fixed income and economic difficulties, People's Liberation Army soldiers, rickshaw pullers, and students receiving scholarships, etc.).

　　京中苏友协通知
    酌情减免会费
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市中苏友好协会，关于会员缴纳会费问题，曾决定无力缴纳会费之会员，可依章程声请减免，但近闻有些支会仍向无力缴纳之会员征收会费，因此市友协于四月一日支会联席会上再一次通知，凡无力缴纳会费之会员（如无固定收入经济困难之农民、解放军、三轮车工人及领助学金的学生等）各级支会应减收或免收会费。
