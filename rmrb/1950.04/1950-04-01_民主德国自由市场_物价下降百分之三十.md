　　Democratic Germany Free Market
    Prices Down 30 Percent
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch] Following the announcement of price reductions in the German Democratic Republic on the 25th, prices in the free market also fell. According to a Berlin dispatch from the German News Agency (ADN) on the 27th, prices in the free market of the German Democratic Republic fell by approximately 30 percent on the 26th. Since the establishment of the free market, prices have decreased by a total of 50 to 80 percent. The prices of some goods have almost returned to pre-war levels.
    In discussing the price decline, the "Daily Review" wrote that price reductions implemented by the government and throughout the country are impossible in any capitalist country (such as West Germany). The sole interest of private large corporations is to raise prices and reduce wages, thereby obtaining higher profits for capitalists. They have no concern for supplying residents with high-quality, low-priced goods. They would rather have millions of unemployed people starve—as in the United States—throwing coffee into the sea and burning grain, in order to reduce supply and raise prices.
    According to a United Press dispatch on the 27th, since the government of the German Democratic Republic announced a 32 percent reduction in the prices of industrial goods and a 28 percent reduction in the prices of food, business in Berlin stores is booming, and the value of the Mark has also risen.

　　民主德国自由市场
    物价下降百分之三十
    【新华社三十一日讯】德意志民主共和国于二十五日宣布减低物价后，自由市场物价亦随之下跌。据电通社柏林二十七日消息：二十六日，德意志民主共和国自由市场物价约下跌百分之三十。自有自由市场以来，其物价共已减低百分之五十至八十。有些物品的价格差不多已降至战前水平。
    在论及物价下跌时，《每日评论》报写道，政府与全国执行的物价下落，在任何资本主义国家（例如西德）都是不可能的。私营的大企业公司唯一的利益是提高物价，减少工资，而为资本家取得更高的利润，他们绝不关心供给居民以物美价廉的东西，他们宁愿让千百万失业的人去挨饿——例如在美国——，把咖啡抛到海里，焚毁谷物，俾减少供应，以提高物价。
    另据合众社二十七日消息，自从德意志民主共和国政府宣布工业品减价百分之三十二，食物减价百分之二十八以后，柏林各商店生意兴隆，马克的币值亦已上升。
