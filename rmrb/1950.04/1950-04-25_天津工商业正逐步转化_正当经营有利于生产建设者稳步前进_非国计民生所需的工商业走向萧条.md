[Report from this Newspaper] Under the circumstance that prices are expected to remain stable for a long time, which is beneficial to the operation of legitimate industry and commerce, Tianjin's industry and commerce are gradually transforming. In March, Tianjin's private industry and commerce continued the trend of January and February, gradually moving towards normal development. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau: In March, the approved openings included more than a dozen industries in the industrial sector, such as shoes and hats, hardware smelting, mineral oil refining, egg processing, electrical equipment, stationery manufacturing, and sewing, totaling 131 households; in the commercial sector, there were more than twenty industries such as north and south native products, hardware, transit, import and export, and hotels, totaling 245 households; the number of transfers in and out of industries were 11 in the industrial sector, such as shoes and hats, and rubber, and 35 in the commercial sector, such as wood industry and department stores; the industrial sector approved for closure by the Industry and Commerce Bureau included knitting, hardware wire making and other industries, totaling 116 households, and the commercial sector included cotton yarn cloth silk, sugar groceries and other industries, totaling 261 households; in total, the industrial sector actually increased by 15 households, and the commercial sector actually decreased by 16 households. The entire industry and commerce decreased by one household in mid-March.

Judging from the opening, transfer, and closing of industrial and commercial businesses in March, there are five obvious changes:

Several New Large Factories Have More Capital Than Before

(1) The change from small to large and from quantity to quality is gradually forming: First of all, it is reflected in the concentration of capital. The total amount of capital of the new industrial enterprises opened in March was more than 820,000 unit of account, an increase of 122.2% compared with February; the average per household opened in March was 6,257 unit of account, an increase of 83% compared with 3,413 units in February; those with capital of more than 3,000 unit of account accounted for 22.6% of the total number of opened households, while it only accounted for 19.8% in January and February, an increase of 2.8%. In particular, there were four relatively large factories applying for opening in mid-March, such as Fumin Egg Processing Factory and Hezhong Dyeing and Chemical Factory, with funds of about 250,000 unit of account each; more than 60,000 units more than the largest Hongxing Egg Factory with 150,000 units opened in February, the largest since liberation. In commerce, the average capital of the 245 newly opened households was 1,213 unit of account, an increase of 43% compared with the average of 845.35 units per household in January and February. Secondly, judging from the power equipment of the factories, in January and February, only 22.3% of the total number of opened households had power equipment, while in March, there were 39 households, accounting for 29.77% of all openings, an increase of 7.47%. Even in terms of employees, there was also an increase. The average number of new employees per household in the industrial sector was 13, an increase of 1.3 people compared with the average number of new employees per household in January and February; the average number of employees per household in the commercial sector was 2.93, an increase of 0.29 people compared with January and February.

Urban and Rural Social Funds Are Invested in Legitimate Industries

(2) Under the circumstance that prices are expected to remain stable for a long time, social funds are gradually invested in legitimate industry and commerce: The source of funds for newly opened commercial businesses, that is, personal savings and investment reached 80,905 unit of account, accounting for 27.22% of the total capital of commercial openings, which is the largest item in terms of commercial funds (excluding those who changed industries); In addition, 19 vendors and merchants turned to industry and 15 started operating formal businesses last month; at the same time, several households also transferred from brothels and rural areas to engage in industry and commerce.

The Trend of Commerce Turning to Industry is More Obvious

(3) The trend of commerce turning to industry is more obvious. Among the 261 commercial households that closed down in March, 39 households in industries such as cotton yarn cloth silk, sugar groceries, and paint pigments turned to industries such as spinning wool, electric wires, shoemaking, weaving, and oil mills. In terms of capital: The total capital of all closed businesses was more than 698,000 unit of account, of which the capital transferred to industry accounted for 17.3% of the total capital of closed businesses. In addition, part of the capital of the dyeing and chemical factory in the aforementioned four newly opened large factories was also transferred from the import and export industry in commerce.

Many Industries Needed for Production and Construction Are Developing Steadily

(4) Industries and commerce needed for production and construction and commerce that can promote urban and rural internal and external exchanges are developing steadily: For example, in the industrial sector, industries such as electrical equipment, mineral oil refining, copper tin, and bricks and tiles have openings but no closures; copper iron, hardware smelting and other industries are also increasing without decreasing. Even among the closed households, most of them are small factories. Among the steadily developing industries, such as the 11 factories manufacturing flour machines such as Huoren and Baofeng, are rushing to do out-of-town custom work. The output in March increased by about 30% compared with February; in addition, the 31 factories manufacturing bicycle flywheels, axles, etc., produced more than 285,000 pieces of various parts in March, but the actual sales reached 300,000 pieces, with both production and sales increasing by 28%. For example, the hardware smelting industry produced 376 tons of machine parts in March, but the actual sales reached 392 tons, with both production and sales increasing by about 6% compared with February; 97 tons of agricultural tools were cast, an increase of 90% compared with February, and 93 tons were sold, an increase of 63% compared with February. Other industries such as wire drawing and nail making have also improved, and have accepted orders of 390 tons from the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency and the Telecommunications Bureau. 137 copper and ironware industries formed a joint factory. In addition to completing 5,000 sets of water pipes for the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, they also signed a contract for 9,000 sets with the Northeast Military Industry Department, and the production efficiency also increased by 42%. Under the large-scale orders from the Railway Bureau, Xingang, and China Merchants Bureau, the paint pigment industry produced nearly 30,000 gallons in March, an increase of 37.3% compared with February; fish oil production increased by 366%. The enamel industry also saw a significant increase in output due to large orders from troops and units such as China Textile, Railway Bureau, etc.

Some industries have also made great progress in production and sales due to accepting processing and manufacturing from state-owned enterprises. For example, the flour industry processed flour for the North China Grain Company, and milled 490,000 bags of flour in March, an increase of 25% compared with last month. After the four major yarn factories in the cotton textile industry signed a processing contract with the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company, the raw material problem was solved, and labor-capital relations were improved as a result. The production enthusiasm was extremely high, and the yarn production in March increased by 34% compared with February. In addition, the output of wool textile industry, rubber industry, brick and tile industry, etc. has increased without decreasing, and production is progressing steadily.

In addition, in commerce, three import and export industries were newly opened, with a total capital of 9,900 unit of account, accounting for more than 10% of the total capital of commercial openings; for example, the north and south native products trade industry had 10 openings last month, which is the industry with the most openings in commerce.

These situations fully prove that all industrial and commercial industries that are suitable for national construction and the needs of the broad masses of the people, especially those engaged in operation under the economic leadership of the state and have various economic ties with state-owned enterprises, can continue to produce and move forward steadily even under the current situation of great changes in market prices.

Those Who Rely on Speculation and Hoarding for Development Decline with Price Stability

(5) Industries with overproduction and rough finished products and commerce that relies solely on rising prices for survival are beginning to decline: For example, the match industry, which has blindly developed since the liberation of Tianjin, has the largest number of applications for closure due to the oversupply of products and the capital turnover difficulties of the capitalists. Four factories, including Zhongnan, have been approved for temporary closure, and three factories, including Minsheng, have been closed. At the same time, among the 116 industrial households that closed down, the main reasons for their closure are nothing more than the following four: ① poor technology, ② weak capital, ③ many products do not meet specifications, ④ product oversupply, forming a backlog of sales. Commerce that has always relied on rising prices for survival has begun to decline in a stable price situation, especially the cotton yarn cloth silk industry in commerce. Twenty-six households closed down last month, most of which had exhausted their funds. For example, a certain bureau of the cotton yarn cloth industry relied on purchasing China Textile's Red Five Fortune Cloth for speculation before liberation. After liberation, especially since the Spring Festival, there was no opportunity for speculation, and the internal expenses were huge, so all the funds were lost; another example is a certain household in the sugar groceries industry, which thought that prices would rise after the Spring Festival. Last year, it borrowed 18 million yuan from the money house and purchased sugar from Shanghai to Tianjin, hoarding it and not selling it. It borrowed money again to purchase it before the Spring Festival. As a result, the price of sugar fell after the festival, plus the high interest burden, the household closed down.

However, in this gradual reorganization and transformation of industry and commerce, there are still industries that blindly pursue profits and are still blindly developing, such as the carpet industry in the industrial sector, which added seven new households last month. At a time when the sales channels for carpets abroad have not yet been opened, adding more carpet industries is now completely a blind production.

　　天津工商业正逐步转化
    正当经营有利于生产建设者稳步前进
    非国计民生所需的工商业走向萧条
    【本报讯】在物价长期看稳，于正当工商业经营有利的情势下，津市工商业在逐步转化中。三月份津市私营工商业仍本一、二月份之趋势，逐步走向正常的发展，据津市人民政府工商局统计：三月份批准开业的，计工业方面有鞋帽、五金冶制、矿油制炼、制蛋、电工器材、文具制造、缝纫等十几个行业共一三一户；商业方面有南北土产、五金、转运、进出口、旅店等二十几个行业共二四五户；行业中转出转进的，工业方面有鞋帽、橡胶等十一户，商业方面有木业、百货等三十五户；经工商局批准歇业的工业有针织、五金线制等业共一一六户，商业有花纱布绸、糖杂货等业共二六一户；以上计工业实增十五户，商业实减十六户，整个工商业在三月中是减少了一户。
    根据三月份工商业开、转、歇业的情况来看，有五点明显的变化：
  新开大厂数家资金胜过以往
    （一）由小到大，由量到质的变化逐渐形成：首先表现在资金集中上，三月份新开业的工业资金总额为八十二万多个折实单位，比二月份增加百分之一二二·二；三月份开业的平均每户为六二五七个折实单位，比二月份的三四一三个单位增加百分之八三；资金在三千个折实单位以上的，占总开业户的百分之二二·六，而一、二月份只占百分之十九·八，增加了百分之二·八。尤其在三月中申请开业的有四个比较大的工厂，如福民制蛋厂，和中染化工厂，二处资金都在二十五万个折实单位左右；比二月开业中最大的鸿兴蛋厂的十五万个折实单位，尚多六万多个单位，为解放后开业最大者。在商业上，新开的二四五户之平均资金为一二一三个折实单位，较一、二月份平均每户八四五·三五个单位比较增加百分之四十三。其次由工厂的动力设备方面来看，一、二月份，有动力设备的只占开业总户数的百分之二二·三，而三月份为三十九户，占全体开业的百分之二九·七七，增加了百分之七·四七。即使在从业人员方面也有增加，工业上平均新开每户为十三人，较一、二月份新开每户平均增加了一·三人；商业上平均每户二·九三人，较一、二月份增加○·二九人。
  城乡社会资金投向正当行业
    （二）在物价长期看稳的情况下，社会资金逐步投向正当的工商业：商业上新开业的资金来源，出自个人储蓄而投资的即达八○九○五个折实单位，占商业开业资金总额的百分之二七·二二，在商业的资金方面（除转行转业者外）以此项为大。另外，上月中由摊贩行商转入工业的有十九户，开始经营正式商业的有十五户；同时由妓院、由农村转来经营工商业的也有几户。
  商业转向工业趋势更加明显
    （三）商业转向工业的趋势更加明显。在三月份商业户歇业的二六一户中，有花纱布绸、糖杂货、油漆颜料等业三十九户转入纺毛、电线、制鞋、织布、油坊等工业。就资金说：全部歇业的资金共六十九万八千余折实单位，其中转入工业的占全部歇业资金的百分之十七点三。另在前述的四个新开大工厂中的染化工厂，其资金也有一部分是从商业中的进出口业转入的。
  适合生产建设需要不少工业稳步发展
    （四）为生产建设所需要的工商业和能促进城乡内外交流的商业正在稳步发展：如在工业中电工器材、矿油炼制、铜锡、砖瓦等业有开业的无歇业的；铜铁、五金冶制等业也是有增无减。即在歇业户中亦大部均为小工厂。在稳步发展的行业中，如火仁、宝丰等十一家制造面粉机的工厂正在赶做外埠定活，三月份生产量较二月份增加约百分之三十；另外制自行车飞轮、车轴等的三十一家工厂，三月份生产各种零件二十八万五千余件，但实销则达三十万件，产销均增加百分之二十八。又如五金冶制业三月份生产机器零件三七六吨，但实销达三九二吨，产销均比二月份增加百分之六左右；铸农具九十七吨，较二月份增加百分之九十，销九十三吨，较二月份增加百分之六十三。他如拔丝制钉工业亦形好转，并接受水利推进社及电信局三九○吨的订货。铜铁器业一三七户组成联合厂，除给华北水利推进社完成水管五千套外，又与东北军工部签订九千套的合同，生产效率亦提高了百分之四十二。油漆颜料业在铁路局、新港、招商局大批订货下，三月份生产将近三万加仑，较二月份增加百分之三七·三；鱼油产量增加百分之三百六十六。搪瓷业亦因部队与中纺、铁路局等单位大量订货，产量亦显著增加。
    有的行业因为接受国营企业的加工制造，产销亦有很大进展。如面粉业给华北粮食公司加工，三月份代磨面粉四十九万袋，较上月增加百分之二十五。棉纺业四大纱厂与花纱布公司订立加工合同后，原料问题解决了，劳资关系亦因而获得改进，生产情绪极高，三月份产纱较二月份增加百分之三十四。另外毛纺织业，橡胶业、砖瓦业等产量均有增无减，生产正稳步进行。
    另外，在商业中，进出口业增开了三户，资金共为九、九○○个折实单位，占商业开业户的资金总额百分之十强；再如南北土产贸易业，上月中开业十户，为商业中开业户最多的行业。
    这些情况充分证明了凡是适合于国家建设与广大人民需要的，特别是和国营企业发生了各种经济联系而在国家经济领导下从事经营的工商行业，虽然处于目前市场物价大变化情况下，仍然能够继续生产和稳步前进。
  靠投机囤积发展者随物价平稳而萧条
    （五）生产过剩和成品粗糙的工业和专靠物价上涨吃饭的商业开始萧条：如在津市解放后盲目发展起来的火柴工业，因产品供过于求，资方周转不灵而呈请歇业者最多，已批准临时歇业的有中南等四厂，歇业者有民生等三厂。同时，在工业歇业的一一六户中，其歇业的主要原因不外是下列四个：①技术太差，②资金薄弱，③产品多不合规格，④产品供过于求，形成滞销状态者。一贯专靠物价上涨而生存的商业，在物价平稳的状况下开始没落，其中尤以商业中的花纱布绸等业内局为最，上月中共歇二十六户，其中大部分是资金耗尽者。如花纱布业的某内局，解放以前即赖购买中纺红五福布进行投机，解放后，尤其是春节以来，无机可投，内部开支浩大，遂将资金全部赔尽；又如糖杂货业某户，以为春节以后物价必涨，去年向钱庄借款一千八百万元，由上海购糖来津，囤积不卖，春节前又借款购买了一次，结果节后糖价下落，加上高的利息负担，该户遂致关闭。
    但是，在此工商业逐渐改组和转化中，尚有单纯追求利润，而还在盲目发展的行业，如工业中的地毯业，上月又增开七户，在国外地毯销路尚未打开的时候，再增开地毯工业，在现在完全是一种盲目的生产。
