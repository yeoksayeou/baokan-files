　　Rationalization Proposal Succeeds: Ma Pinru Commended

　　Ma Pinru, the deputy foreman of the blending room at Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, noticed that the temperature in the stemming group was very high to prevent the tobacco leaves from spoiling, which made it easy for workers to get sick. He, therefore, decided to find a way to lower the temperature. With the support of the Zhangjiakou City Trade Union Working Group and the factory's trade union, and with the help of other comrades, after four rounds and twenty-five experiments, the working process was improved, allowing the temperature to be lowered to sixty-six degrees. After the factory implemented it, the stemming group workers saw their health secured due to improved working conditions, which boosted their morale, reduced waste, and created new records. Comrade Ma Pinru's successful rationalization proposal has been rewarded and commended by the Zhangjiakou City Trade Union, the Chahar Provincial Department of Industry, and the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government.

　　合理化建议成功  马聘儒受表扬
    张垣纸烟厂调切室副工长马聘儒，见到除梗组因为要使烟叶不坏，而室内温度很高，使工友容易得病。于是便决定设法使温度降低。在张垣市工会工作组和该厂工会支持以及其他同志帮助下，经过四回二十五次试验，结果改良工作过程，使温度可以降低至六十六度。厂方实行后，除梗组工友因劳动条件改善，健康有了保障，生产情绪高涨，减少了浪费，创造了新纪录。马聘儒同志这个合理化建议的成功，已得到张市工会、察省工业厅、和张市人民政府的奖励和表扬。
