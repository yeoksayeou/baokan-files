　　Correspondent of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee, Xǔ Zizhēn
　　In order to fulfill this year's production increase tasks, Communist Party branch members in various villages of Ren County, Hebei Province, have been using various meetings to publicize production policies, dispelling the masses' concerns about cotton being cheap if planted too much, and increased production leading to heavier burdens. They are also actively taking the lead in helping the masses formulate plans. Ten villages in the First District, seven villages in the Second District, twenty villages in the Third District, and six villages in the Fourth District have all successively formulated production increase plans. In Yanggutun Village in the First District, Party members first formulated individual plans and production increase plans for the village at a branch meeting. Then, through expanded cadre meetings and mass meetings, a production committee was established to study the production plans proposed by the branch. The masses in the whole village were divided into five large groups, with Party member cadres providing specific assistance, mobilizing households and groups to buy agricultural implements and dig wells together, and enthusiastically discussing ways to increase production. Party member Guo Zengren said, "If it hadn't been for planting cotton last year, we would have had nothing to eat. This year, we must plant five mu of cotton and apply three cartloads of manure per mu." The masses Zhang Quanliang and Zhang Yulin said, "To increase production, we must dig wells and turn dry land into paddy fields." After half a day of discussion, branch secretary Zhao Luocong and branch committee member Liu Youde took the lead in organizing twenty households to buy two waterwheels, which could expand paddy fields by seventy-four mu. The masses Zhang Quanliang, Zhang Yulin and other ten households dug seven wells. All sixty-three households in the village plan to plant 115.6 mu of cotton, 1,982 hemp seeds, and 419 trees. In the Second District, Party member village cadres in Guojiazhuang Village convened a mass meeting on the first day of the Lunar New Year, using concrete accounting and summarizing achievements to encourage the masses. Party member Guo Tianzeng planted half a mu of cotton last year, harvested ninety jin, exchanged it for four hundred jin of red sorghum, and planted four mu of sorghum, harvesting one hundred and thirty jin. He said, "One mu of cotton is equivalent to six mu of land, so we must plant more this year." The masses in the whole village recognized the benefits of planting cotton, and every household formulated a plan. Last year, eighty mu of cotton were planted, and this year, the plan is to plant three hundred mu.
　　As spring plowing began, Guan Zeren, the branch secretary of Guanjiazhuang Village in the First District, and Party member Guan Buding took the lead in going to the fields on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, plowing six mu of land in one day, influencing the masses, including Guan Nizi, to also go to plow, and hoeing three mu of wheat. Liu Qingyu, the branch secretary of Chengjiazhuang Village, and all Party member cadres mobilized the masses to help each other harrow the autumn wheat fields once. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, there was not a single idle animal in the whole village. In ten days, all 1,579 mu of autumn wheat fields in the whole village were harrowed. Party member village cadres in the Fourth District convened mass meetings and symposiums on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year to widely publicize and put forward slogans such as "Go to the fields early during the Spring Festival to avoid regretting being late," calling on people and animals to help each other and take advantage of the drought to plow the land. Under the promotion and influence of Communist Party branch members throughout the county, according to statistics from fifty-two villages, 39,090 mu of autumn land have been plowed; according to statistics from forty-seven villages, 45,935 mu of land have been harrowed; according to statistics from forty-three villages, 50,470 mu of land have been irrigated, 1,170 mu of wheat have been hoed, and 3,560 cartloads of manure have been delivered.
