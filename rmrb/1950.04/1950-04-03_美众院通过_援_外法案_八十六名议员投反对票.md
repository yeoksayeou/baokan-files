Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd dispatch from TASS: On March 31st, the US House of Representatives, after drastically cutting the appropriations for the Marshall Plan proposed by the government and Truman's so-called Point Four Program for developing backward areas, finally passed the so-called "foreign aid" bill for the next fiscal year. Even with these cuts, eighty-six Representatives voted against the bill. The final vote was 287 to 86. Although the government requested $3.1 billion for the Marshall Plan for the next fiscal year, the bill passed by the House only approved $2.85 billion, a reduction of $250 million. In addition, despite Acheson's appeal to Congress to pass the Point Four Program's appropriation of $45 million without any cuts, the House bill only approved $25 million. The House bill also approved $100 million for the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea, $100 million for the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, and other reactionary regimes in South Asia.

　　美众院通过“援”外法案
    八十六名议员投反对票
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：三月三十一日，美国众院在剧烈地削减了政府所提马歇尔计划的经费与杜鲁门的所谓发展落后地区计划之后，最后通过了下年度的所谓“援”外法案。即使有了这些削减，仍有八十六名众议员投票反对这个法案。最后表决是二八七票对八十六票。虽然政府为下一会计年度的马歇尔计划要求拨款三十一亿美元，但众院所通过的法案只批准了二十八亿五千万美元，即削减了二亿五千万美元。此外，尽管艾奇逊呼吁国会通过发展落后地区计划的经费四千五百万美元不加任何削减，而众院的法案只批准了二千五百万美元。众院的法案同时批准了一亿美元给南朝鲜的李承晚集团，一亿美元给台湾的蒋介石集团以及南亚其他反动政权。
