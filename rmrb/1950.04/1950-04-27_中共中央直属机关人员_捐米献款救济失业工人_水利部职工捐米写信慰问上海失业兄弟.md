Xinhua News Agency, 26th: To relieve unemployed workers nationwide, personnel of organs directly under the CCP Central Committee are actively donating. Following the appeal issued by the Party Committee of Organs Directly Under on the 21st of this month, personnel from various organs responded enthusiastically. In the past few days, a total of 31,215 catties of millet and 9,052,180 yuan have been donated. Originally, the Party Committee, considering that most personnel in organs directly under are on a supply system and live a very frugal life, only proposed a donation of one catty of millet per person. However, all personnel fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for class friendship, with the vast majority donating several catties or more. Many personnel donated all or most of their monthly allowances, and some even donated all of their long-term savings, with some donations reaching as much as 500 catties. Stone Zhenyang and Hu Sanming, two veteran revolutionary administrators of the General Office of the Central Committee, who have been involved in the revolution for nearly 30 years and have no savings, still donated their entire monthly allowance. Chen Keming, a correspondent from the United Front Work Department, preferred to give up smoking cigarettes and donated 100 catties of millet at once. They believe that the current difficulties faced by the worker brothers are temporary and can be overcome with everyone's efforts.

This newspaper reports: The staff of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, 188 people in total, donated 3,189 catties of millet, equivalent to 3,613,137 yuan, to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai. The staff of the ministry also collectively wrote a letter of condolence, saying: "We are very concerned after hearing about your current difficult situation. You have made great contributions in the anti-imperialist and anti-Chiang struggle, as well as in protecting factories, supporting the army, purchasing victory bonds, and developing production before and after liberation. Now, even though you are in a difficult living situation, you still have a strong belief in the bright future of completely eliminating the remnants of Chiang's bandits and building the national economy. This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the working class. In addition to expressing our deep condolences to you, we would like to hand over our surplus wages of 3,613,137 yuan to the People's Bank of China for transfer, to do our best as brothers. We believe that you will overcome these difficulties in the victorious advancement with the full support of worker brothers across the country."

    捐米献款救济失业工人
    水利部职工捐米写信慰问上海失业兄弟
    【新华社二十六日讯】为救济全国失业工人，中共中央直属各机关工作人员踊跃捐助。本月二十一日中央直属党委会发出号召后，各机关人员即热烈响应，数日来共捐小米三万一千二百一十五斤、现款九百零五万二千一百八十元。党委会原来鉴于直属各机关工作人员多为供给制待遇，生活本已很刻苦，仅提出一人一斤米的号召，但全体工作人员充分发扬阶级友爱的热情，绝大部分均捐助数斤以上。很多工作人员捐出一月全部或大部的津贴，个别工作人员甚至将长期节约积蓄悉数捐出，有数达五百斤之多。中央办公厅行政处管理员石振扬、胡三明两位老革命工作人员，参加革命近三十年，素无积蓄，仍将全月津贴悉数捐出。统一战线工作部通讯员陈克明宁肯戒掉纸烟，而一次捐出小米一百斤。他们认为工人兄弟们目前的困难是暂时的，只要大家努力援助，是可以克服的。
    【本报讯】中央人民政府水利部职工，一百八十八人共捐出小米三千一百八十九斤，合人民币三百六十一万三千一百三十七元，救济上海失业工人。该部职工并集体写慰问信说：“我们听到了你们目前的困难处境之后，不胜关怀，你们在反帝反蒋斗争中，以及在解放前后的护厂、劳军、认购胜利公债和发展生产等事迹中，都曾贡献了极大的力量，现在你们虽处于生活困难的情况下，仍能对彻底消灭蒋匪残余及建设国家经济事业的光明前途具有坚强的信念，这更十足表现了工人阶级的英勇气概，除向你们致以深切的慰问外，谨将我们节余出的工资三百六十一万三千一百三十七元交由中国人民银行转上，聊尽兄弟之谊。相信你们会在全国工人兄弟的全力支援下战胜这一胜利前进中的困难的。”
