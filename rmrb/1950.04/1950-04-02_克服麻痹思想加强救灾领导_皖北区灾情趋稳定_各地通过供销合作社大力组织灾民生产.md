Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 1st: After investigating the disaster and famine situation in the Northern Anhui region and overcoming the complacency and bureaucratic work styles of some leading cadres, significant progress has been made in disaster relief work over the past two months, and the disaster situation in most areas is now trending towards stability.

Last year's production and disaster relief work in Northern Anhui was hampered by a lack of in-depth understanding of the disaster situation among some cadres, leading to complacency or pessimistic and despairing sentiments, which exacerbated the disaster. After discovering the above situation, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office and the Northern Anhui District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened various emergency meetings in mid-January, explicitly stating that production and disaster relief was the overriding central task of the entire region, and instructed leading cadres at all levels to strengthen ideological and organizational leadership in production and disaster relief, continue to conduct in-depth investigations of the disaster situation, and propose disaster relief methods to the disaster victims. The Northern Anhui Daily also published consecutive editorials, which played a significant role in overcoming the complacency of leading cadres and promoting disaster relief work. At the end of January, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office began to establish production and disaster relief committees from the administrative office to the county, district, and township levels. Some areas also established production and disaster relief headquarters and work teams to fully lead production and disaster relief work. Statistics from the Suxian Special District alone show that more than 2,800 cadres were directly involved in production and disaster relief. Zheng Baozhen, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, Li Yunhe, and Lu Xuebin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northern Anhui District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led disaster area慰问团consolation groups and inspection teams to heavily affected townships in Suxian, Anqing, and other areas to conduct in-depth investigations and guide disaster relief work.

　　克服麻痹思想加强救灾领导
    皖北区灾情趋稳定     
    各地通过供销合作社大力组织灾民生产
    【新华社上海一日电】皖北区经过查灾查荒、克服某些领导干部的麻痹思想与官僚主义作风后，两月来救灾工作已获得显著成绩，目前大部地区灾情已趋稳定。
    皖北去年的生产救灾工作，曾因某些干部对灾情缺乏深入的了解，存在着麻痹思想或悲观失望情绪，致使灾情严重。皖北行署和中共皖北区党委发现上述情况后，乃于一月中旬召开了各种紧急会议，明确提出生产救灾为全区压倒一切的中心任务，并指示各级领导干部加强生产救灾的思想领导与组织领导，继续深入调查灾荒情况，向灾民提出救灾的办法。皖北日报亦连续发表社论，对克服领导干部麻痹思想、推动救灾工作，起了很大作用。皖北行署又于一月底开始从行署到县、区、乡普遍建立生产救灾委员会，有些地区并成立生产救灾指挥部、工作队，以全力领导生产救灾工作。仅宿县专区统计，直接投入生产救灾的干部即有二千八百余人。行署副主任郑抱真、李云鹤和中共皖北区党委宣传部长陆学斌等率领灾区慰问团、巡视组分赴宿县、安庆等重灾区乡，深入调查与指导救灾工作。
