How to Carry Out Contract Management?
    North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters Instructs Various Regions

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Over the past year, cooperatives in North China have achieved considerable success by extensively adopting contract management in their business operations. However, due to a lack of experience among cadres at all levels of the cooperative system in the widespread adoption of contract methods, several shortcomings persist in the drafting and execution of contracts. The North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters issued instructions to cooperatives at all levels on February 15th, with the following key points:

    1.  Contract management is the best operational method for organizing direct exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, realizing planned commodity circulation, consolidating the leadership of state-owned and cooperative economies, and guiding the small-peasant economy to lean towards the state-owned economy for the recovery and development of production. This method can tightly integrate state-owned and cooperative entities, as well as superior and subordinate cooperatives and friendly neighboring regional cooperatives, to fully exert the role of stabilizing the market and guiding the national economy forward. Last year, the cotton procurement work in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces, because it used contract agreements to combine state-owned entities and cooperatives, completed the task of procuring 140 million jin of cotton. Chahar province used contracts to connect cooperatives in various special districts, counties, and cities, completing the supply and production of 320,000 pieces of agricultural implements. In addition, Hebei and Pingyuan provinces used contracts to develop sideline production in disaster areas, and counties in Shanxi Province widely signed contracts with village cooperatives to organize and lead the operations of grassroots cooperatives and transform old cooperatives, so that the operations of grassroots cooperatives would entirely proceed from the needs of cooperative members in production and life. Although the emphasis varied among the provinces in the adoption of contract methods, all achieved significant results. From now on, our North China cooperatives at all levels should widely adopt this new scientific management method to improve operational techniques and overcome blindness in operation.

    2.  Before signing a contract, conduct thorough investigations and research, formulate your own business plan from the bottom up. The business plan is the basis for organizing contract signing. After clarifying what to sell, what to supply, and their quantity, specifications, and quality, then find the contract signing partner, and use the signing of the contract to ensure the realization of the business plan. Of course, in the process of organizing the contract, the business plan can also be appropriately revised according to the actual situation. However, it would be blind to sign a contract without a business plan.

    3.  When signing a contract, be meticulous and find a rational and mutually beneficial principle. Matters such as raw material sources, cost size, delivery location, freight, damages, packaging, output, price, time, season, as well as capital and cadre strength, must be carefully calculated. Not only should you calculate your own strength, but also help the other party calculate, find a reasonable exchange ratio, and combine current interests with long-term interests. There should be no purely profit-driven "grab and run" mentality, to avoid affecting product sales and production development.

    4.  After the contract is signed, actively organize forces to execute the contract in accordance with the contract's provisions regarding the quality and quantity of goods, delivery time, and location. Currently, some cadres do not have a clear understanding of contracts and have the erroneous idea that "it doesn't matter whether the contract is executed or not." Cadres in Zhangbei, Datong, Wanquan, and other county cooperatives have reported: "It is easy to execute contracts with private individuals, but difficult to execute contracts with cooperatives." This illustrates the seriousness of the problem. We believe that this idea will seriously affect the development of the contract management system and the improvement of economic planning and organization. Therefore, our cadres at all levels must resolutely oppose this incorrect idea. Higher-level cooperatives should regularly check the execution of contracts by lower-level cooperatives and promptly correct various deviations. In the future, if there is a lack of attention to or dishonesty in the execution of contracts, resulting in disputes and losses to the other party, the responsible party shall be liable for compensation. The higher-level cooperative should send personnel to inspect and investigate responsibility, and educate about the incident. If the execution of the contract is affected by irresistible disasters, the other party should be notified immediately and the reasons explained.

    5.  In cooperatives where cadres have poor business skills, insufficient understanding of the situation, and lack sufficient experience in contract management, the quantity should be small and the duration short when signing contracts. After gaining experience, continue to sign contracts. Although it takes more effort, it can reduce problems. Facts have proven that large-quantity and long-term contracts often affect the execution of the contract and the relationship between the two parties signing the contract due to insufficient understanding of the actual situation, changes in objective forms, and price fluctuations. Ping Shun County Cooperative has mastered the principle of "signing contracts with village cooperatives with small quantities, short durations, and frequent times," and the contract is executed very well. This experience can be adopted by cooperatives in various regions as appropriate.

    6.  Attention should also be paid to the form of the contract. Some county cooperatives in Chahar Province write contracts on cigarette cases or small pieces of yellow grass paper, which are manifestations of being careless and not paying attention to the contract, and should be corrected immediately. The specifications and quality of the goods sold should be clearly and precisely specified in the contract. In one contract, Wanquan and Wei County Cooperatives only stipulated "good quality, no problems" for quality. Such empty, ambiguous wording is most likely to cause disputes. In the future, when signing contracts, cooperatives should strive for thorough and practical stipulations on these specific issues to avoid subsequent disputes.

    7.  Larger contracts should have guarantors. Having a guarantor has a supervisory effect on the signing and execution of the contract. When county cooperatives sign contracts with county cooperatives, there should be a guarantee from the special district cooperative. When special district cooperatives sign contracts with special district cooperatives, there should be a guarantee from the provincial cooperative. When provincial cooperatives sign contracts with provincial cooperatives, there should be a guarantee from the North China Headquarters. If cooperatives at all levels sign contracts with state-owned companies at the same level, there should be a guarantee from the higher-level cooperative or the financial committee at the same level. The responsibilities of the guarantor to both parties of the contract are as follows:

    	① Consider the role of the contract in the national economy from a policy perspective, and review the content of the contract from a fair position that takes into account the interests and difficulties of both parties to see if it complies with the principle of mutual benefit; whether the terms listed in the contract are reasonable, detailed, and in line with the actual situation.

    	② Have the responsibility to supervise and inspect the execution of the contract, and make suggestions and criticisms when problems are found, and order both parties to fulfill the contract.

    	③ In the process of executing the contract, if unforeseen problems occur due to changes in the situation, affecting the execution of the contract, the guarantor shall be responsible for arbitration and mediation.

    8.  Cooperatives in various counties of Shanxi Province have widely adopted contract methods to organize the operations of grassroots cooperatives and transform old cooperatives, and have achieved significant results. This method can extend the planning and organization of production and exchange to the village and to every producer and consumer, so that the operations of cooperatives start from the needs of the masses and implement the mass line in business. This method can gradually organize the scattered, unquantifiable, non-standardized, and seasonal small-peasant economy to suit the needs of concentrated, meticulously calculated, uniformly standard, quality, and regular urban industry. County-level cooperatives in Hebei, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces should widely adopt this method to specifically organize production, disaster relief, and other supply and marketing operations.

　　怎样开展合同经营？
    华北供销合作总社指示各地
    【本报讯】华北各地合作社去年一年来在业务经营上，大量采用了合同经营的方式曾有不少成绩，但因为各级合作社干部对于广泛采用合同方式经营，还缺乏经验，在订立合同及执行合同时，还有不少缺点，华北供销合作总社曾于二月十五日对各级合作社作了指示，其要点如下：
    １、合同经营是组织城乡物资直接交换，实现有计划的商品流转，巩固国营及合作社经济的领导权，使小农经济向国营经济靠拢以恢复和发展生产的最好的经营方式，用这种方式可以把国营与合作社及合作社上下级社及友邻区社的业务紧密的结合起来，充分发挥稳定市场引导国民经济向前发展的作用，去年河北、平原、山西三省的征购棉花工作，因为用合同协议结合了国营与合作社，完成了征购棉花一亿四千万斤的任务，察哈尔省用合同把各专县市合作社结合起来，完成三十二万件农具的供给及生产的任务，此外如河北、平原两省用合同发展灾区副业生产，山西省各县社广泛与村社订立合同，用合同来组织领导基层社的业务和改造旧社，使基层社的业务，完全从社员群众生产上及生活上的需要出发。以上各省在采用合同方式上，虽然重点不同，但是都收到了显著的成效，今后我们华北各级合作社应广泛采用这种新的科学的经营方式，来提高经营技术，克服经营中的盲目性。
    ２、订立合同前要进行深入的调查研究工作，由下而上的订出自己的业务计划，业务计划是组织订合同的根据，明确了推销什么？供给什么？其数量、规格、质量如何以后，再找订合同的对象，用订合同来组织保证业务计划的实现。自然在组织合同的过程中，也可以根据实际情况适当的修正业务计划，不过，如果没有业务计划就去订立合同，那就是盲目的。
    ３、订立合同时要精打细算，找出合理两利的原则，诸如原料来源、成本大小、交货地点、运费、伤舍、包装、产量、价格、时间、季节，以及资金、干部力量等均须精密计算，不但要计算本身的力量，而且要帮助对方计算，找出合理的交换比价，要使目前利益与长远的利益结合，不应有单纯营利的捞一把的思想，以免影响到产品的推销及生产的发展。
    ４、合同订立后，应根据合同规定货品的质量、数量、交货时间、地点、积极组织力量去执行合同。目前有些干部对合同的认识不够明确，存在着“执行不执行没关系”的错误想法。张北、大同、万全等县社干部反映：“和私人订合同好执行，和合作社订立合同不好办。”这正说明这问题的严重性，我们认为这种思想会严重的影响到合同经营制度的开展，影响到经济的计划性及组织性的提高，所以我各级干部必须坚决反对这种不正确的想法，各上级社对下级社执行合同的情况，应有经常的检查，即时的纠正各种偏向。今后如有对执行合同不重视不老实的态度，并因而发生纠纷，使对方蒙受损失时，应负赔偿之责，上级社并应派员检查，追究责任，对所发生的事件进行教育，如因不可抗拒的灾害影响合同的执行，应即通知对方说明理由。
    ５、在干部经营技术较差，对情况了解不够，对合同经营尚无充分经验的合作社，订立合同时数量要小，期限要短，找出经验后，再继续订立。虽多费点力量，却可以少出些问题。事实证明，数量大，期限长的合同，常常会因为对实际情况的了解不够，客观形式的变化及物价的变动，影响到合同的执行。及订立合同双方的关系。平顺县社由于掌握了“和村社订立合同数量少，时间短，次数勤”的原则，合同执行得很好，这个经验各地社均可酌情采用。
    ６、对于合同的形式，也需要引起重视。察省部分县社把合同写在卷烟盒纸上，写在小块黄草纸上，都是马虎草率，不重视合同的表现，应即纠正。在合同上对售品的规格质量等，应作详细明确的规定。万全和蔚县两社在一次合同上，对质量只规定了“质量好，没毛病”六个字，这种空洞的模棱两可的词句，最易引起争执，今后各社在订立合同时，对这些具体问题的规定，应力求周密切实，以免事后的争议。
    ７、订立较大的合同，应有保证人。有了保证人，对于合同的订立和执行是有监督作用的。县社与县社订立合同，应有专区社的担保，专区社与专区社订立合同，应有省社的担保，省社与省社订立合同，应有华北总社的担保。如各级社与同级国营公司订立合同，应有上级社或同级财委会的担保。保证人对于合同双方应负的责任如下：
    ①从政策上考虑合同对国民经济的作用，以照顾双方利益及困难的公正立场，审查合同内容，是否符合两利的原则；合同上所列条款，是否合理、周详、切合实际情况。
    ②对合同的执行，有监督检查的责任，并在发现问题时，提出建议及批评，责成双方履行合同。
    ③在合同执行过程中，如因情况的变化，发生事前预想不到的问题，致影响合同的执行时，保证人应负仲裁及调解之责。
    ８、山西省各县合作社广泛采用合同方式来组织基层社的业务和改造旧社，均收到显著的成效。用这种方式，可以把生产和交换的计划性、组织性，一直贯彻到村，贯彻到每一个生产者和消费者身上去，使合作社的业务从群众的需要出发，在业务上贯彻群众路线。用这种方式，可以把分散的、无法统计的、无规格的、带有季节性的小农经济逐步组织起来，以适合于集中的、精打细算的、统一规格、质量的、经常的城市工业的需要。河北、平原、绥远、察哈尔等省县级合作社应广泛采用这种办法，来具体组织生产救灾及其他供给及运销业务。
