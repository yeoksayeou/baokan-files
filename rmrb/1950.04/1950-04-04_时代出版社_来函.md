"Shidai Publishing House" Letter

To the Editor:

　　On the 26th of this month, your newspaper's "People's Literature and Art" supplement published two reviews about the translated works "Sagan's Spring" and "Soviet Children Heroes," published by the Shanghai Shidai Bookstore. Although the end of the articles noted that "Shanghai Shidai Bookstore" is not "Shidai Publishing House," after the articles were published, many enthusiastic readers and friends in the publishing industry have continuously inquired, mistakenly believing that Shidai Bookstore is our Shidai Publishing House. Therefore, we must declare the following: "Shidai Publishing House" was established in Shanghai as early as 1941, and has established a branch in Beijing. It has absolutely no relationship with the recently emerged "Shanghai Shidai Bookstore," and has no business dealings with them. Although the articles you published this time do not criticize the books we translated and published, we still sincerely hope that all parties will give us criticism and suggestions, and please publish this letter in your newspaper as a statement.

　　With respectful greetings,
                            Shidai Publishing House Beijing Branch
                                  March 29, 1950

### “时代出版社”来函

专栏：

　　“时代出版社”来函编辑同志：
    本月二十六日你们报纸的“人民文艺”副刊上，登了两篇关于上海时代书局出版的翻译作品“萨根的春天”和“苏联儿女英雄传”的评论，虽然文末注明“上海时代书局”并非“时代出版社”，但是文章刊出之后，仍有许多热心的读者和出版界的朋友们不断来询问，他们都误会时代书局就是我们时代出版社。因此我们不得不声明如下：“时代出版社”远于一九四一年就在上海成立，并已在北京设立分社。和最近出现的“上海时代书局”绝无关系，甚至和他们没有业务上的往来。你们这次所发表的文章虽然不是批评我们翻译出版的书籍，但是我们仍旧竭诚希望各方面给予我们批评和意见，同时请把这封信发表在你们的报上，以作声明。此致敬礼
                            时代出版社北京分社谨启
                                  一九五○年三月二十九日
