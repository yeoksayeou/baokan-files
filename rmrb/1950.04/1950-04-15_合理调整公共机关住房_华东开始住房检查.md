　　Rationally Adjust Public Authority Housing
    East China Begins Housing Inspection
    [This newspaper Shanghai dispatch] (Reporter Zhou Ziqin reports): In order to rationally solve the housing problems of various authorities, the East China Compilation Committee has formed a housing inspection task force composed of more than 40 cadres to begin inspecting the housing situation of public authorities in Shanghai. There were originally more than 20,000 public houses in Shanghai, but the municipal government actually took over only more than 8,000, with the remaining more than 10,000 in the hands of a small number of authorities. Because the Shanghai area is too large, and the situation was not well understood at the time of the initial takeover, many authorities found their own houses and moved in, resulting in many unreasonable phenomena. Some authorities occupied too many houses; some individuals lived in several rooms; some rented out surplus houses; and some did not want to live in houses that were too far away, leaving the houses empty and having to hire people to look after them. Some former salaried employees, with monthly incomes of 300 to 400 "realistic units," still lived in public housing. On the other hand, many leading authority cadres had no housing, and had to rent hotels at high prices; some newly established authorities also had no housing, leaving newly transferred cadres to live in guesthouses or hotels. This phenomenon not only added a large amount of rent expenditure to the state, but also was a great waste of working time and energy. In order to solve this problem, the Compilation Committee decided to implement public housing inspection and adjustment. This work is expected to be completed in 40 to 60 days. The first step is to do a good job in ideological mobilization, mobilizing self-reporting, and at the same time conduct investigation, registration, and cleaning up, formulate forms, and make a general statistical report. The second step is to conduct inspection. Anyone who does not report and register will be punished once found out. After the inspection is completed, a general adjustment plan will be proposed, and houses will be allocated according to the new staffing and work needs of each authority after staffing quotas have been set. At the same time, a unified property management committee will be organized to be specifically responsible for the management and repair of public houses.

　　合理调整公共机关住房
    华东开始住房检查
    【本报上海讯】记者周子芹报道：为了合理解决各机关住房问题，华东编制委员会已组成一个包括干部四十余人的房屋检查工作队，开始检查上海各公共机关住房情况。上海原有公共房屋两万多幢，但经市政府实际接管的只有八千多幢，其余一万多幢都在少数机关手里。由于上海地区太大，初接收时，对情况又不够了解，不少机关自己找到房子就住进去了，以致形成许多不合理的现象。有的机关单位占的房子太多；有的一个人住了几间房子；有的把多余的房子出租；也有的因分到的房子太远。不愿去住，空着房子，还得专门雇人看管。有些实行薪金制的旧职员，每月收入薪金三四百个折实单位，仍住着公家的房子。但另一方面，却有许多领导机关的干部人员没有房子住，以致不得不以高价租住旅馆；有些新成立的机关单位也因没有房子，让新调来的干部住在招待所或旅馆里。这种现象不特给国家增加了很大一笔房租开支，在工作时间与精力上，也是很大的浪费。编制委员会为了解决这个问题，决定实行公房检查与调整。这一工作，预计以四十天到六十天全部完成。第一步首先作好思想动员，动员自报，同时进行调查、登记、清理，拟订表格，作出总的统计报告，第二步进行检查，凡不报告登记者，一经查出，定予处分。检查完成之后，提出总的调整方案，根据各机关新的编制及工作需要等情况，在定员定额之后，分给一定的房屋。同时并组织统一的房产管理委员会，专门负责公共房屋的管理修补工作。
