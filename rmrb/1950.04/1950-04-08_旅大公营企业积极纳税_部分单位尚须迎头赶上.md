　　Lushun-Dalian Public Enterprises Actively Pay Taxes
    Some Units Still Need to Catch Up

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Lushun-Dalian People's Daily on April 1st: The Lushun-Dalian Tax Bureau is currently carrying out the registration and collection of taxable inventory for all public enterprises in order to implement the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. All public enterprises are actively paying taxes. Before carrying out inventory registration and supplementary collection work, the Lushun-Dalian Tax Bureau first convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the city and county tax bureaus, sections, and the finance departments of Jinzhou and districts, to specifically discuss and arrange the division of labor and implementation steps. Then, each city and county separately held symposiums for various public enterprises, explaining the main significance of the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and also discussing the procedures for goods tax registration. After the meeting discussions, ideological concerns and misunderstandings existing among some enterprise cadres were dispelled, making everyone clear that the collection of goods tax would not only not affect production costs, but also, because the government centralized funds and solved financial difficulties, it could accelerate national economic construction and stabilize prices. It could also urge public enterprises to strengthen cost accounting and the management of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, so as to reduce costs. Because everyone had a clear understanding ideologically, many public enterprises and Sino-Soviet joint ventures consciously and automatically carried out goods registration and promptly paid taxes at the beginning of this work. For example, the electric materials of the Far East Electric Power Company, a Sino-Soviet joint venture, as well as the Caoda Factory, Cement Factory, and Glass Factory, completed the registration of taxable goods on March 21 and paid the tax in full in a timely manner. The Oil and Grease Factory and Qiulin Company under the Soviet Foreign Trade Department also paid the goods tax on March 29. According to current statistics, the Sino-Soviet joint venture sector has performed better. Among the twenty-one units in this sector, eighteen factories have largely completed goods registration, and most of the tax payments have also been paid. However, some enterprise units have delayed tax payments with various excuses because they have not carefully studied the decision of the Government Administration Council. It is hoped that they will earnestly study the decision of the Government Administration Council and catch up.

　　旅大公营企业积极纳税
    部分单位尚须迎头赶上
    【本报讯】据四月一日旅大人民日报消息：旅大税务局为执行中央人民政府政务院货物税暂行条例，现正进行各公营企业应征税存货登记及征收工作，各公营企业均积极纳税。在未进行存货登记和补征工作以前，旅大税务总局，首先召集各市县税务局、科及连市、区财政部门负责干部会议，具体的讨论和布置了工作分工与进行步骤，然后各市县，便分头召开了各公营企业座谈会，逐条讲解了中央人民政府政务院颁布的货物税暂行条例主要意义，同时并讨论了货物税登记手续等问题。经过会议讨论后，打消了部分企业干部存在的思想顾虑和错误认识，使大家明确了征收货物税不但不会影响生产成本，而且由于政府集中了资金，解决了财政上的困难，更可以使全国经济建设加速发展，稳定物价。并能督促公营企业加强成本核算与原料材料、半成品、成品的管理，使成本降低。由于大家在思想上有了明确认识，因此在开始进行这一工作时，很多公营企业和中苏企业便都自觉自动的进行货物登记，迅速交款。如中苏合营企业远东电业公司所属电品料，曹达工厂、洋灰工厂、玻璃工厂等皆已于三月二十一日将应征税的货物登记完毕，并及时交清税款，油脂工厂及苏联外商部所属秋林公司等部亦于三月二十九日将货物税款交清。据目前统计，中苏合营企业部门成绩较佳，该业二十一个单位中已有十八个工厂货物大部登记完毕，同时税款也大部交齐。但尚有部分企业单位由于没有很好研究政务院的决定，因此在执行中，以各种借口拖延纳税，希望认真研究政务院的决定，迎头赶上。
