　　Talking about Standard Flour
　　Yang Sheng

　　Wheat, like rice, has a husk. Inside the husk are several layers of membrane. Wheat that has only had the husk removed is called whole wheat. If further processed, the outer layer of membrane can be ground off. The ground-off membrane is commonly called wheat bran. Wheat bran, like rice bran, also contains very rich vitamins, fats, and proteins. Therefore, even top-grade flour is quite lacking in Vitamin B. However, compared to mechanically produced refined white rice, flour contains more protein and fat, and also more inorganic salts. It is commonly thought that the physique of people in northern China is stronger than that of people in southern China because northerners eat more wheat, although this point remains to be proven, there is no doubt that wheat is richer in nutrients than rice. Therefore, we are very willing to suggest to the people of South and Central China that, whenever possible, they should often add wheat foods to their diet, or eat some coarse grains like millet, which is very beneficial to their health.

　　The following diagram shows a longitudinal section of a "whole wheat" grain. I have also roughly indicated the distribution of the various nutrients I mentioned earlier in the "whole wheat" grain. I believe that after seeing this, everyone will gain a deeper understanding of the truth behind the matter we are discussing today, which is why we are so carefully advocating the consumption of "standard rice" and "standard flour." [Diagram: Distribution of Various Nutrients in Wheat]

　　The second table shows the distribution of Vitamin B1, B2, nicotinic acid, and iron in various parts of whole wheat.

　　Second Table: Content of Vitamin B1, B2, Nicotinic Acid, and Iron in Various Parts of Whole Wheat

|                             | Whole Wheat | Wheat Bran | Germ | Outer Layer | Endosperm | Inner Layer Endosperm |
|-----------------------------|-------------|------------|------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Vitamin B2 (IU/gram)        | 1.2         | 1.6        | 58   | 1.5         | 0.2       |                       |
| Vitamin B1 (mg/gram)        | 1.6         | 5          | 30   | 1.8         | 0.7       |                       |
| Nicotinic Acid (mg/gram)    | 50          | 250        | 120  | 150         | 22        |                       |
| Iron (mg/100g)              | 3.5         | 12         | 18   | 10          | 2.1       |                       |
| % of Whole Wheat Weight (g/100g) | 100         | 12         | 2.5  | 3           | 85.5      |                       |

　　From the second table, we can clearly see how Vitamin B1, B2, nicotinic acid, and iron are concentrated in the "wheat bran" (including "bran" and "grain membrane"), "germ," and the outer layers of the "endosperm." This explains why we repeatedly remind everyone that when grinding flour, you must be careful not to grind away these parts of the wheat grain that are rich in valuable nutrients. The "81 Flour" standard is based on this scientific principle. The old standards for top-grade machine-made flour and refined white rice violated this scientific principle. Therefore, we must abolish this erroneous old grain processing standard and re-establish a new grain processing standard that is in line with scientific principles and of great benefit to the health and hygiene of the people. This is what has been repeatedly mentioned in this article, and what the government has already stipulated today: "92 Rice" and "81 Flour." From now on, we will call "92 Rice" and "81 Flour," produced under the new grain processing standard, "standard rice" and "standard flour."

　　When standard rice and flour are universally consumed by the people of the whole country, it will be a major improvement in the healthy living of the Chinese people under the existing economic conditions.

### 谈标准面

　　谈标准面
    杨胜
    小麦和米一样，它也有壳。壳内也有好几层膜。仅去壳的麦，叫全麦。如再加工，可将外层的膜磨去，磨下来的膜，通常叫麦麸。麦麸和米糠一样，同样含有很丰富的维生素、脂肪和蛋白质。故头等面粉，也是十分缺乏乙种维生素的。但是，如以头等面粉和机制精白米比较起来，面粉所含的蛋白质和脂肪，要比米多些，无机盐也要多些。一般人常以为我国北方人的体格比南方人强壮，是由于北方人吃面食的关系，这点虽有待证明，但麦的营养素较米为丰富，这是没有疑问的。所以，我们很愿意向华南华中的人民建议，在可能范围内应当常常添用面食，或者加食一些像小米之类的杂粮，对于身体的健康是有很大好处的。
    下面的一个图，表示着一粒“全麦”的纵剖面。我把前面所曾提到过的各种营养素在“全麦”上的分布情形也约略的把它们表示了出来，相信大家看了以后，会对我们今天所讨论的一些问题，就是为什么要这样慎重其事的来提倡食用“标准米”和“标准面”的事情，当可以更进一步的了解它的真象了。图：小麦中各种营养素的分布情形
    第二表，是表明维生素乙１，乙２，烟碱酸和铁在全麦各部分中含量的分布情形。
        第二表：全麦各部分中维生素乙１，乙２，烟碱酸和铁的含量
                            全麦      麦麸      谷胚    外层  谷体  内层谷体维生素乙２（国际单位／克）  １．２    １．６    ５８      １．５    ０．２维生素乙１（公丝／克）      １．６    ５        ３０      １．８    ０．７烟碱酸（公丝／克）          ５０      ２５０    １２０    １５０    ２２铁（毫克／百克）            ３．５    １２      １８        １０    ２．１占全麦重量（克／百克）      １００    １２      ２．５      ３      ８５．５
     从第二表里，我们可以很明显的看到维生素乙１，乙２，烟碱酸和铁是如何的集中分布在“麦麸”（包括“谷皮”和“谷膜”），“谷胚”和较比外面一些的“谷体”里面。这就是说明了，为什么我们要三番五次的提醒大家，当你在磨面的时候，你得千万要留意到麦粒上面这些富含宝贵营养素的部分，勿使磨去。“八一面”的规定，就是基于这个科学的道理而规定出来的。过去的机制头等面粉和精白米，是违反了这个科学的道理的。所以我们要把这个错误的、旧的粮食加工标准取缔掉，重新来规定一个合乎科学原理的、对人民大众健康和卫生有莫大利益的、新的粮食加工标准。这就是本文所一再提到的，也是今天政府所已经规定了的“九二米”和“八一面”。从今起，我们就给这些由新的粮食加工标准下制出来的“九二米”和“八一面”，称为“标准米”和“标准面”。
    标准米、面被全国人民普遍食用的时候，就是在现有的经济条件下，对于中国人民健康生活一个重大改进。
