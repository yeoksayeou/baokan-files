　　Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, and Others Issue Written Statements
　　Congratulating the PLA on Landing on Hainan Island

　　[This newspaper reported] Following the announcement of the People's Liberation Army's victorious landing on Hainan Island, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the spokesperson stationed in Beijing for the China Zhi Gong Party all issued written statements expressing their congratulations. Li Jishen's statement considered the People's Liberation Army's landing on Hainan Island "a joyous occasion of great significance, worthy of our encouragement and rejoicing." He said, "The people's armed forces are irresistible, a fact that has been repeatedly proven. This time, it has been proven again that the vast ocean still cannot stop them." Zhang Lan's statement said, "The remaining reactionary elements fled the mainland and entrenched themselves in Taiwan and Hainan Island, spreading deceitful lies that the People's Liberation Army could not conduct cross-sea operations, fantasizing about escaping the fate of being finally eliminated. Now, the People's Liberation Army's victorious landing on Hainan Island has shattered the remaining reactionary elements' pipe dreams. This is the prelude to the liberation of Taiwan." Ma Xulun said, "The PLA's landing on Hainan Island is another blow to US imperialism." The spokesperson for the China Zhi Gong Party said, "In addition to extending our infinite respect and condolences to the soldiers landing on Hainan Island, we also predict that the liberation of Taiwan will be realized in the near future."

　　李济深张澜等发表书面谈话
    祝贺解放军登陆海南岛
    【本报讯】人民解放军胜利登陆海南岛的消息发表以后，中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、民主同盟主席张澜、中国民主促进会主席马叙伦、及中国致公党驻京发言人都发表书面谈话，表示祝贺。李济深谈话认为人民解放军的登陆海南岛，“是一件有重大意义的喜事，值得我们鼓舞欢欣。”他说：“人民的武力，是不可抗拒的，事实上已经屡次证明了。这一次又重新证明，宽阔的海洋，仍然挡不住它。”张澜谈话称：“残余的反动分子，逃出大陆，盘据台湾、海南岛，宣传人民解放军不能渡海作战的欺骗谎言，幻想躲避最后被消灭的命运，现在人民解放军胜利的登陆海南岛，打破了残余反动分子的迷梦，这是解放台湾的先声。”马叙伦说：“解放军登陆海南岛，是给美帝国主义的又一个打击。”中国致公党发言人说：“我们除对登陆海南岛的战士们致无限的敬意与慰劳外，并预祝台湾的解放在不久的将来也将实现。”
