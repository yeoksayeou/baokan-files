To lay the foundation for quota management
　　The Jingsi Chengzi Coal Mine Mechanical and Electrical Group Implements Card-Based Piecework System; Workers Continuously Set New Records
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to news from the "Mentougou Miner" newspaper: Since the Mechanical and Electrical Group of the Chengzi Coal Mine in the Mentougou Mining Area of Western Beijing began using the card-based piecework system in March, the workers' production enthusiasm has greatly increased, and they have continuously set new records. This group handles a wide variety of tasks, and there have never been standards for work, nor precise calculations for how much labor and materials are used for each piece of work. After liberation, the workers realized that they had become masters, their work enthusiasm was very high, and production efficiency continued to improve. But how much exactly had it improved? How much labor and materials had been saved or wasted? Who did more work? Who did better work? Who should be rewarded? None of this could be accurately calculated. The reason was that there were no "quotas."
　　The Mechanical and Electrical Group had planned to implement "quota" production last year. However, this work was a very troublesome thing. To implement "quotas," the first step was to have detailed records of work achievements, and to find the standard for each piece of work from the records. After careful research by Tao Faxiang, the director of the Mechanical and Electrical Group, and comrades such as Zhang Yuejiang, and enthusiastic discussions with the workers in the group, the card-based piecework method was adopted to calculate the labor and materials required for each piece of work. This method was implemented from March 1st. Before each piece of work is done, the Mechanical and Electrical Group office first estimates the labor and materials and writes them on the planning form; then it is given to the foreman and workers doing the work for discussion, and after both parties (the office and the workers) finally agree, it cannot be modified without special reasons, and they supervise each other to ensure the completion of the plan. After the task is completed, it is compared with the original plan, and the work results are recorded on the card, how much labor and materials were used, how much labor and materials were saved, and who did it are all clearly recorded, which greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. Since March 1st, many new records have been created, and work efficiency has been significantly improved. Fitters Zhang Zhizhong and Zhang Fugui planned 182 hours to make eleven sets of coal bunker mouths and axle frames, but completed it in 112 hours, saving 70 hours. Lathe operator Gao Shizhong planned to turn 240 five-cent screws, originally planning to turn 60 screws per day (eight hours) and complete it in four days, but completed the task in eleven hours, saving 21 hours of labor, turning 174 screws per day, and efficiency almost doubled. Gao Shizhong said: "When I heard that the Xishan Mine turned 80 screws a day, I was anxious, and I turned more than 170 screws with extra effort; I have to work hard and challenge the miners in all the mines in Mentougou." On March 15th, a tooth fell off the large gear of the coal cutter, and seven workers, including Chen Jingru, accepted the repair task. According to past experience, it would take at least five and a half hours to repair it. But they repaired it in only two hours and forty minutes, saving two hours and fifty minutes compared to before, reducing the loss of eighty-five tons of coal. Electricians Gao Hanhua and Zhu Baolai made carbon brush holders for a 75-horsepower motor, originally scheduled for 132 hours, but completed it in 92 hours, saving 40 hours of labor. Ironworkers Jia Mengshen and Qiao Changzhu, lathe operator Zhang Xueqing, fitters Di Zhendong, Yao Yuhai, Sun Mingli, Du Jingquan, and all the workers of the underground mechanical and electrical team 3 have all created unprecedented new production records. Now all the workers of the Mechanical and Electrical Group are continuing to work hard.

　　为定额管理打下基础
    京西城子煤矿机电组实行卡片计工制  工友连创新纪录
    【本报讯】综合“门头矿工”报消息：京西门头沟矿区城子煤矿机电组自三月份开始采用卡片计工制以来，工友生产情绪大为提高，连续创造新纪录。该组事多活杂，作活向来没标准，作一件活用多少工多少料，从来没有精确的计算。解放后，工人认识到自己做了主人，工作情绪很高，生产效率不断提高。但到底提高了多少？节省、浪费了多少工料？谁干活多？谁干活好？谁应得到奖励？都不能精确地计算。原因就是没有“定额”。
    机电组在去年就计划实行“定额”生产。但是这件工作是很麻烦的事情。要搞“定额”，第一步就得有工作成绩的详细纪录，从纪录中找出每件活的标准。经过机电组主任陶发祥及张月江等同志的精心研究和机组工友的热烈讨论，采用了卡片计工的方法，来计算每件活的所需工料。这个方法是从三月份开始实行的。在每作一件活之先，机电组办公室先估出工料，写在计划单上；然后拿给做这个活的领班和工友讨论，经两方（办公室与工友）最后同意后，没有特殊原因就不能修改，相互督促保证计划完成。任务完成之后，再和原来的计划对照，把工作结果记在卡片上，用了多少工料，省了多少工料，是谁做的，都记得清清楚楚，这样大大鼓励了工友的生产积极性。从三月一号起到现在创造了许多新纪录，使工作效率显著提高。钳工张执中、张富贵，作煤仓嘴及轴架十一套订计划一百八十二小时完成，结果一百十二小时就完成了，省工七十小时。旋工高世忠，旋五分螺丝二百四十条，原来计划每天（八小时）旋六十条，四天完成，结果用十一小时完成任务，省了工二十一小时，每天合旋螺丝一百七十四条，效率几乎提高了两倍。高世忠说：“我一听说西山矿一天旋八十条，我就急了，一加劲就旋了一百七十多条；我还得努力干，和门头沟各矿的矿工挑战。”三月十五日镐车大牙轮掉了一个牙，陈敬儒等七位工友接受了修理任务。根据过去经验，修理好最快需要五个半小时。但他们只用两小时四十分就修理好了，比以前省了两小时五十分，减少损失八十五吨煤。电工高翰华、朱宝来，作七十五马力电动机炭精架，原定工一百三十二小时，结果用九十二小时完成，省工四十小时。铁工贾梦申、乔长柱，旋工张学庆，钳工狄振东、姚玉海、孙明礼、杜景全以及井下机电三班全体工友，都创造了前所未有的生产新纪录。现在机电组的全体工友正在继续努力中。
