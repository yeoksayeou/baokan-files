　　Dingxian Prefecture: Over Ten Thousand Farmers Study Regularly
    Combining Production, They Form Eight Hundred Study Groups

    [Dingxian Dispatch] Correspondent Yan Jiyuan reports: In eight counties including Lixian in Hebei Province's Dingxian Prefecture, over twelve thousand farmers have begun regular study. Last winter, Dingxian Prefecture opened winter schools in two thousand five hundred and seventy-one villages (accounting for 89% of the total administrative villages), with a total of over 184,000 male and female students enrolled. During the winter school movement, the Prefectural Office and the Lixian County Government organized winter school work inspection groups to conduct in-depth inspections and guidance of winter school work. In mid-March, the Prefectural Office also issued instructions, urging the counties to seize the opportunity at the end of the winter school term to transform the better-run winter schools into regular people's schools in a planned and led manner, and emphasized strengthening leadership, changing the winter school committee into a literacy committee, and improving the organization to lead the people's school work. According to incomplete statistics, 355 winter schools (21 classes, 862 groups) in eight counties including Lixian, with 12,717 students, have been transformed into regular study. The following experiences have been gained in the work:

    1. Conduct extensive publicity and deliberation to dispel ideological concerns of the people's school teachers and the masses; and educate cadres and teachers to overcome simplistic work styles, starting from going deep into the masses and breaking through ideological barriers. At the beginning of the people's school work, forced orders occurred in some areas, and this deviation has been promptly corrected by the leading organs, explaining that running people's schools should enlighten the masses and make them voluntarily enroll. Some people's school teachers were afraid of delaying production. To address this, the county convened a propaganda and education committee meeting, repeatedly conveying the spirit of carrying out literacy education, so that teachers realized the importance of their responsibilities and the bright prospects; and explained that they would definitely solve the difficulties in production for everyone, and the teachers' emotions stabilized. For example, after village chief Li Paizi and Li Luobu of Beiniu Village and the teachers helped each other in production, the teachers became active, increasing the study group from 30 people to 65 people. The county also organized all forces (education section, people's cultural center, education assistants, primary schools, etc.) to carry out extensive publicity through various means such as blackboards, manual broadcasting, comics, and oral lectures, to dispel the masses' ideas of neglecting learning and concerns about the "contradiction between production and learning." Lixian County has done a better job in this regard. Of the 197 administrative villages in the county, 124 villages have transformed their winter schools into regular people's schools (accounting for 63% of the administrative villages), with 5,445 students.

    2. Closely integrate learning with production and central tasks. The learning organization forms of the people's schools in the prefecture are all formed by the masses voluntarily forming groups according to their level of education, using production gaps for learning. And called on students with conditional collective learning to move towards regular learning by dividing into classes according to their level as far as possible. At the same time, the people's schools also pay attention to cooperating with the central work and carrying out ideological education to improve the political consciousness of the masses. For example, some people's schools explained the significance of the People's Congress, promoting the village election work.

    3. Mobilize activists to take the lead and solve the financial difficulties of the people's schools. In addition to a portion of the funds being appropriately subsidized by the county, each people's school also called on activists to lead all students to use various methods to solve the problem. For example, 26 women in Panying Village, Lixian County, organized three spinning groups, learning while producing, and drawing a portion of the profits to solve the difficulties of textbooks and stationery for the people's schools. Twelve male adults in the school also organized a manure collecting group, using a portion of the manure money to subscribe to newspapers for learning. This newspaper reading group has persisted for more than six years.

　　定县专区万余农民常年学习
    结合生产组成八百学习小组
    【定县通讯】通讯员阎纪元报道：河北省定县专区蠡县等八县，已有一万二千余农民转入常年学习。定县专区去冬有二千五百七十一个村开办了冬学（占行政村总数的百分之八十九），入学男女学员共达十八万四千余人。冬学运动期间，专署和蠡县县府等曾组织冬学工作视导团，深入检查、指导冬学工作。三月中旬，专署又发布了指示，督促各县抓紧冬学结束时机，有计划有领导地把办理较好的冬学转为常年民校，并着重提出要加强领导，将冬学委员会改为识字委员会，健全机构，以领导民校工作。据目前不完全统计，蠡县等八个县已有三百五十五个村的冬学（二十一个班、八百六十二个小组），一万二千七百一十七名学员转入常年学习。在工作中，得出下列几点经验：
    一、进行广泛的宣传酝酿，解除民校教师及群众的思想顾虑；并教育干部和教师，克服简单的工作作风，从深入群众，打通思想着手。民校工作刚开始时，个别地区曾发生强迫命令的现象，这一偏向已经领导机关及时纠正，说明办民校要启发群众觉悟，使其自愿入学。有的民校教师则怕耽误生产，该县为此召开了宣教委员会议，反复贯彻了开展识字教育的精神，使教师们认识到自己责任的重大，及光明的远景；并说明一定替大家解决生产中的困难，教师情绪才安定下来。如北牛村村长李牌子、李洛布等和教师在互助生产以后，教师便积极起来，使三十人的学习组增到六十五人。县里并组织一切力量（教育科、人民文化馆、教育助理、小学等），利用黑板报、人力广播、漫画、口头讲演等多种方式，进行广泛的宣传，解除群众轻视学习的思想，和“生产与学习矛盾”的顾虑。这一点，蠡县做得较好，全县一百九十七个行政村，就有一百二十四个村的冬学转为常年民校（占行政村的百分之六十三），学员达五千四百四十五人。
    二、学习与生产与中心工作密切结合。该专区各民校的学习组织形式，都是由群众自愿按文化程度结成小组，利用生产空隙进行学习。并号召有条件集体学习的学员，在可能范围内，按程度分班，走向正规学习。同时，民校也注意与中心工作配合，进行思想教育，以提高群众政治觉悟。如：有的民校里讲解了人民代表会的意义，推动了村选工作。
    三、发动积极分子带头，解决民校经费困难。各民校的经费除由县里适当补助一部分外，并号召积极分子带动全体学员，用各种办法来解决。如蠡县潘营村二十六个妇女组织了三个纺线组，一面学习，一面生产，抽出一部分红利，解决了民校课本及文具的困难。该校并有十二个男成年组织了拾粪组，拿一部分粪钱订报纸来学习，这个读报组已经坚持了六年多了。
