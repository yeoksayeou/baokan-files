[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Capitalists in Beijing's private pottery kiln, weaving and dyeing, small kiln, oil vat, and night soil industries were stipulated in labor-capital collective contracts to pay to the trade union an amount equal to 1.5% of the total wages of all employees each month on the day wages are paid, as cultural and educational expenses. However, the capitalists in these industries have mostly failed to fulfill this obligation. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau has specifically re-stipulated two measures for paying employee cultural and educational expenses: (1) All private factories and shops that have signed labor-capital collective contracts and stipulated a cultural and educational expense item in the contract must, by the 3rd of each month, convert the amount payable for the previous month into the equivalent value of wages in kind and submit it to their respective trade associations, which will then remit it to the respective industry trade union by the 5th of each month. (2) For all factories and shops whose cultural and educational expenses have been formally agreed upon, payments should be made from the date the contract is approved and takes effect by the Labor Bureau. Those who are overdue in payment or whose payments are insufficient must quickly make up the outstanding amount (to be converted into the equivalent value of wages in kind on the day of supplementary payment). In the future, any further delays in payment will be treated as non-compliance with the contract.

　　京私营盆窑等业资方
    多未按月交付文教经费
    劳动局规定办法要求严格执行
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营盆窑业、织染业、小窑业及油篓业和粪业等在劳资集体合同中曾规定资方应按月于每月开支工资当日交付本行业工会等于全体职工工资总额百分之一点五的文教经费。但各该行业的资方，多未履行。京市人民政府劳动局为此特再统一规定缴纳职工文教经费的两项办法：（一）凡已订立了劳资集体合同并在合同中规定有文教费一项的各私营工厂商店，一律于每月三日前按当日工资实物折算，将应缴之上月文教费交到所属同业公会，由该业公会于每月五日前汇转该行业工会。（二）对于文教经费已经正式成立协定之各工厂、商店，自合同经劳动局批准生效之日起，即应缴纳，其逾期未缴或所缴款项不足者，须迅速补足所欠款额（应按补缴时之当日工资实物折算）。今后如再有拖延不缴者，即以不遵守合同论处。
