　　Planting Cotton in Wheat Fields
    Bai Renmin, Xinji Farm, Hebei

    The Hebei Provincial Xinji Agricultural Experiment Station conducted an intercropping experiment with cotton and wheat last year. The results showed that, per mu, in addition to harvesting 276 jin of wheat, they also harvested 162 jin of cotton; frost-damaged cotton accounted for 30 percent, and the total income from cotton and wheat was equivalent to 936 jin of millet. In the farm's ordinary cotton area, each mu yielded 256 jin of cotton, with frost-damaged cotton accounting for over 15 percent, totaling the equivalent of 850 jin of millet. Comparing the two, intercropping cotton and wheat yielded an additional income of 56 jin of millet per mu compared to planting cotton alone. Wang Heichou of Zhongyong Village, Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, planted wheat in wide ridges (two chi wide) the year before last, and planted cotton in the wheat field after Grain Rain last year. After the wheat harvest, he only watered a few times, using the remaining wheat roots in the soil as fertilizer, without applying additional manure. The rest of the process followed the ordinary cotton planting method, resulting in a yield of 128 jin of wheat and 100 jin of cotton per mu.
    Wei Fenggui of Side Village, Third District, Zhao County, in the same area, planted two mu of cotton in wheat fields last year without applying manure. The wheat was planted in narrow ridges, with one cotton plant planted every six chi. Each mu yielded over 120 jin of wheat and over 100 jin of cotton. Because watering was not done promptly after the wheat harvest, frost-damaged cotton accounted for about 40 percent or more.
    Zhang Huyue of Donggou Village, Second District, Luancheng, planted wheat with a row spacing of nine cun last year, planting cotton in every other row. This made the row spacing for cotton one chi and eight cun, and the plant spacing over one chi. After the wheat harvest, ditches were dug between the cotton rows, and about one small cart of animal manure was applied and buried with hoes before watering. The cotton grew well, but because planting was done after the Beginning of Summer, fewer bolls formed on the lower part of the cotton plants, with frost-damaged cotton accounting for about half. Each mu yielded over 100 jin of cotton and over 120 jin of wheat.
    From the above examples, if planting can be done earlier and watering is adequate, the total income will definitely be higher than planting cotton alone. The following points should be noted for planting methods:
    (1) The best sowing period is after Grain Rain. Planting too late will affect the cotton (wheat needs more water during the heading and flowering period), and prevent cotton seedlings from developing early.
    (2) According to the ordinary spacing for cotton, plant cotton in every other row of narrow-ridged wheat, with a plant spacing of one chi to one chi and a half. Planting too densely will affect the development of cotton seedlings.
    (3) Wheat fields evaporate moisture quickly. To ensure that cotton seedlings can emerge safely before the soil dries out, cotton seeds must first be soaked in hot and warm water according to the seed soaking method, and then germinated until they are the size of wheat grains before planting. This will allow the cotton seeds to quickly take root and emerge from the ground after being planted.
    (4) Watering: Because wheat absorbs a lot of water, it is necessary to water twice heavily before sowing to ensure that the cotton sprouts have enough water before emerging from the soil.
    (5) The depth of the planting pit for cotton should be one cun, at most not more than one and a half cun. Deeper planting can easily hinder the emergence of cotton sprouts. However, the pit should be larger to hold more water, and it should be located in the middle of the two rows of wheat seedlings, not too close to the wheat seedlings, to avoid the wheat seedlings absorbing water and affecting the emergence of cotton seedlings.
    (6) Covering with soil: When the soil is neither wet nor dry, planting should be carried out, and each hole should be covered with soil immediately after planting. When covering with soil, first fill the pit with the wet soil around it, and then cover it with a layer of drier soil to prevent moisture from evaporating.
    (7) Pressing the soil: After covering with soil, when the soil is slightly dry, press the soil. When pressing the soil, use a hoe to push over the holes along the ridge, to make the soil surface firm and prevent wind erosion. Afterward, use a hoe to push again every other day in the morning, repeating two or three times, so that the soil is completely firm, otherwise there is a risk of wind erosion.
    (8) To avoid soil cracking and affecting the growth of cotton seedlings during the wheat harvest, wheat can be harvested by cutting, and care should be taken not to damage the cotton seedlings during cutting.
    (9) Applying fertilizer: After the wheat stubble has rotted, if the soil is weak, about 1,000 jin of animal manure can be applied per mu. Spread the manure, hoe it in to mix the manure, soil, and rotten wheat stubble together, and then water once. In this way, the seedlings will get better day by day.
    (10) The remaining management methods are the same as those for general cotton planting.

　　麦垅里点棉花
    河北辛集农场  白任民
    河北省立辛集农事试验场去年曾作了一次棉麦间作的试验。结果，在产量上每亩除收小麦二百七十六斤外，又收了棉花一百六十二斤；霜后花占百分之三十，棉麦两项收入共折小米九百三十六斤。农场的普通棉区，每亩收花二百五十六斤，霜后花占百分之十五多，共折合小米八百五十斤，两者互相比较，棉麦间作，比单独种棉每亩多收入五十六斤小米。石家庄专区高邑县中涌村王黑丑前年种的麦子是大垅（二尺宽），去年谷雨后，在麦地里点上了棉花。麦收后只浇了几次水，利用留在土里的麦根作肥料，未再上粪，其余都按普通种棉的方法进行，每亩收麦一百二十八斤，又收棉花一百斤。
    该区赵县三区四德村魏凤桂，去年在麦地里点种了二亩棉花，没上粪，麦子是小垅，每隔六尺远点一棵棉花。每亩收麦一百二十多斤，收花一百多斤，因为麦收后，没及早浇水，所以霜后花约在百分之四十以上。
    栾城二区东沟村，张虎月去年的麦子是九寸远的行距，隔一垅点一垅棉花，这样棉花的行距就成了一尺八寸，株距一尺多。麦收后在棉垅中间挑沟，上牲口粪约一小车，用锄埋好再浇水。这样棉花长的也很好，但因在立夏以后才点，棉棵的下部结果的较少，霜后花约占一半，每亩共收花一百多斤，收麦子一百二十多斤。
    由以上的实例来看，如果能早些下种，浇水适宜，总收入一定比单独种棉花多。种植方法可注意以下几点：
    （一）播种期最好在谷雨后，过晚了，棉花要受麦子的影响（麦子在?穗开花期间，需水分较多），同时使棉苗不能及早发育。
    （二）按棉花的普通距离，小垅麦子隔一行点一垅棉花，株距一尺至一尺半。种密了，影响棉苗发育。
    （三）麦地蒸发水分较快，为了保证在土壤干燥前棉苗能安全出土，就必须在下种前，把棉籽先按浸种法进行开水温水浸种，然后再使棉籽发芽至麦粒大小时再种，这样就能使棉籽下地后很快的生根出土。
    （四）浇水：因为麦子吸收水分较多，在播种前，必须大大的浇二次水，这样才能保证供给棉芽出土前的水分的需要。
    （五）点种棉花的坑，深度以一寸为合宜，至多不能过一寸半。深了容易妨碍棉芽出土。但坑以大些较好，以便多盛水，并要注意坑应在两垅麦苗的中间，不要离麦苗近了，免的因麦苗吸收水分而影响棉苗出土。
    （六）盖土：在土壤不湿不干时，进行点种，每点一穴要立即盖土。盖土时，要先把坑周围的湿土填在坑里，然后再在上面蒙上一层较干的土，以免水分蒸发。
    （七）擦土：盖土后，土稍干，进行擦土。擦土时，可用锄顺垅把穴上推过，以使土壤表面蹋实不走风为度。事后每隔一天在早晨再用锄推一遍，连推二、三次，土就完全蹋实，不然有走风的危险。
    （八）收麦时为了避免土壤裂缝，影响棉苗生长，可实行割麦，并注意割麦时，勿伤棉苗。
    （九）提青（上追肥）：在麦收麦楂腐烂后，如地弱，每亩地可上牲口粪一千斤上下。把粪撒好，用锄耪一遍，把粪、土和腐烂的麦楂混合在一起，然后再浇水一次。这样小苗就一天一天的好起来。
    （十）其余的管理方法，均和一般的种棉相同。
