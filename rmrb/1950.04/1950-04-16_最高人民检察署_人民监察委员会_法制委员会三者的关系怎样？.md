    What is the relationship between the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Legislative Affairs Committee?

Northeast Daily Social Service Department:

    Your question has been answered by the Central People's Government Legislative Affairs Committee as follows:

    The duty of the Central People's Government Supreme People's Procuratorate is: "To bear the highest prosecutorial responsibility for the strict observance of the law by government organs, public officials, and the people of the whole country." (Article 28 of the "Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China")

    The duty of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government Government Administration Council is: "To be responsible for supervising whether government organs and public officials are performing their duties." (Item 6 of Article 18 of the "Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China")

    The duty of the Central People's Government Legislative Affairs Committee is: To research, draft, and review draft laws and other draft regulations submitted by various organs of the Central People's Government for review and drafting under the direction of the Government Administration Council and the guidance of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, in accordance with the intentions of the Central People's Government.

    From this, it can be seen that the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Legislative Affairs Committee have different responsibilities. There is no subordinate leadership relationship or work guidance relationship between them. As for the various departments under the Central People's Government, they can have necessary working relationships at any time due to work needs or when discussing relevant business issues; of course, this is also the case between these three organs.

　　最高人民检察署  人民监察委员会  法制委员会三者的关系怎样？编辑同志：
    最高人民检察署、人民监察委员会与法制委员会的相互关系如何？
                                  东北日报社会服务部东北日报社会服务部：
    你们的问题，已由中央人民政府法制委员会答复如下：
    中央人民政府最高人民检察署的职责是：“对政府机关、公务人员和全国国民之严格遵守法律，负最高的检察责任。”（《中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法》第二十八条）
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会的职责是：“负责监察政府机关和公务人员是否履行其职责。”（《中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法》第十八条第六项）
    中央人民政府法制委员会的职责是：秉承中央人民政府的意旨，在政务院领导及政务院政治法律委员会指导下，负责研究、草拟与审议法律草案及由中央人民政府各机关交送审拟之其它法规草案。
    由此可见，最高人民检察署、人民监察委员会和法制委员会，三者的职责不同，相互之间既无隶属的领导关系，也无工作的指导关系。至于中央人民政府所属各部门之间，因工作需要或研讨有关之业务问题时，均可随时发生工作上的必要联系；这三个机关之间当然也是这样。
                                                  编者
