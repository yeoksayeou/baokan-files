　　Hebei Province People's Government, in order to avoid disaster victims blindly fleeing famine, has been conducting planned resettlement work for disaster victims in non-disaster areas. According to statistics from 25 counties in Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other regions of Hebei Province, nearly 40,000 disaster victims from severely affected areas such as Ninghe, Baodi and Cangxian have been resettled. When these disaster victims arrived at various villages in the destination, the village support committees first provided proper arrangements for their lives, and mobilized the villagers to comfort and take care of the disaster victims, introduce them to local customs and habits, and educate them about labor production. At the same time, the disaster victims were asked to elect representatives to participate in the village support committee to work together. After this, the village support committee would then organize the disaster victims to produce or try to introduce occupations based on their skills and labor. As a result of these measures, the disaster victims were taken care of in their new areas and were able to engage in production with peace of mind. For example, the disaster victims resettled in Quyang have been organized to make 18,000 pairs of shoe soles, earning 45,000 catties of millet, which can sustain 500 people for three months. The disaster victims resettled in Dingxian region have been organized to boil saltpeter, and can earn more than 1.66 million catties of millet in three months, which can sustain more than 18,000 people for three months. In addition, some disaster victims in some areas are engaged in production in partnership with local residents, which has also solved the livelihood problems of some disaster victims. However, there are also some shortcomings in some places because the work of publicity, mobilization, organization, and planning is not done enough. For example, in Liangjiaying Village, District 9, Xincheng County, some farmers have been feeding the disaster victims for a long time; in Districts 5 and 8 of Huolu County, the disaster victims are only given food every day, but they are not organized to engage in production. In addition, some places have not done enough in organizing disaster victims to produce and educating them, which has led to phenomena that affect social order and the relationship between disaster victims and local residents. The leading organs in various places are now paying attention to correcting these issues.

　　河北安置灾民近四万到非灾区去进行生产
    【新华社三十日讯】河北省人民政府为避免灾民盲目逃荒，曾有计划地在非灾区进行安置灾民工作。据河北省保定、石家庄等专区二十五个县的统计，共安置宁河、宝抵、沧县等重灾区灾民近四万人。当这些灾民到达目的地各村后，各村支援委员会首先在生活上予以妥善安置，并发动村内居民对灾民进行安慰和照顾，向灾民介绍本地的风俗习惯和进行劳动生产的教育，同时要灾民推选代表参加村支援委员会共同工作。在此以后，村支援委员会再根据灾民的技术和劳力，分别组织灾民生产或设法介绍职业。由于采取了这些措施的结果，灾民到了新地区后就得到了生活上的照顾，而能安心进行生产。如安置在曲阳的灾民已组织起来纳鞋底一万八千双，收入小米四万五千斤，能维持五百人三个月的生活。安置在定县专区的灾民已组织起来熬硝，三个月内能收入小米一百六十六万余斤，可以维持一万八千余人三个月的生活。此外，有些地区灾民与当地居民合伙进行生产，也解决了一部分灾民的生活问题。但是，也有一些地方因宣传、动员、组织、计划等工作做得不够，而发生了一些缺点。如新城县九区梁家营等村把灾民长期由一定农户管饭；获鹿县五、八两区每天只发给灾民粮食，而不组织他们进行生产。此外，有的地方还因对组织灾民生产和对灾民教育不够，发生了影响社会秩序和灾民与当地居民关系不融洽的现象。现各地领导机关正注意纠正中。
