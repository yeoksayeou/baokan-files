Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, April 11th: Troops stationed in the Kashgar District of Southern Xinjiang have smoothly launched their production campaign by maintaining close ties with the masses and prioritizing construction projects closely related to the local people, such as canal construction. One battalion, located 120 miles southeast of Shule, helped farmers dig a canal and completed the irrigation of 2,500 mu of land in just four days. The farmers were overjoyed and grateful when the canal water flowed in.

When a unit stationed in Shache was producing in Kongmulik Village, they learned that the local water source problem was very serious. They convened a water conservancy meeting with more than 200 farmers, appropriately addressed the issue of bayi (tyrannical landlords) seizing water resources, and helped farmers build five new large dams and reservoirs. The farmers cherished the canals built by the troops. One night, a section of a canal built by a certain battalion was damaged by the water. When the soldiers rushed to repair it the next morning, more than a dozen farmers were already rushing to repair it. The soldiers were extremely grateful. One farmer said, "Your canal is also our canal."

Because the troops helped solve their water source problem, the farmers said with emotion, "In the past, the big bayi seized the water. Even if they couldn't use it all, they would let it go to waste rather than let us use it. You have truly saved us!" As a result, the relationship between the military and the people is extremely harmonious, and the farmers are also actively helping the troops solve difficulties in production.

When the troops started reclaiming land in the Kashgar and Yarkand River basins, the farmers welcomed them like relatives. During production symposiums, the troops humbly sought advice from elderly Uyghur farmers, who sincerely explained things. Every night, many Uyghur youths near the garrison voluntarily came to explain local production matters to the troops. In a wasteland of 700 mu near the garrison of a certain unit, farmers pointed out the characteristics of the soil plot by plot, correcting some unrealistic plans of the troops. For example, on more than 130 mu of land near the garrison of a certain unit that had been barren for 50 years, the original plan was to plant sesame, but later it was changed to wheat based on the farmers' suggestions.

Once, a unit lacked experience when building a canal, and the water rushed out. When the farmers saw it, they quickly took off their clothes and jumped into the canal to help repair it. Under the guidance and help of the farmers, a canal more than 1,000 meters long was repaired in three days. Once, when soldiers of a certain unit were pulling the rake to plow the land themselves, a farmer named Xian Muxiding saw it and voluntarily led his ox to lend it to the troops. Then, many other farmers also led their oxen to help.

    南疆喀什区军民互助生产
    【新华社迪化十一日电】驻南疆喀什区的部队，由于很好地联系群众并且首先选择与当地群众有密切关系的水渠工程进行建设，使生产运动顺利展开。某营在疏勒东南一百二十里的地方帮助农民开水渠，仅费四天的时间，就完成了灌地二千五百亩的水渠工程。渠水滚滚流来时，农民们又高兴又感激。驻莎车某部在空木里克村生产时，了解到当地水源问题很严重，就召集了有两百多农民参加的水利会，适当地处理了巴耶（恶霸地主）强占水利的问题，并且帮助农民新修了五个大水坝和储水渠。农民们对部队修好的水渠，非常爱护。一天晚上，某营修的渠道被水冲坏一处，战士们第二天早上赶去修理时，已经有十几个农民在赶着补修。战士们感激异常。一位农民说：“你们的渠也就是我们的渠。”农民们因为部队协助解决了他们的水源问题，感动地说：“从前大巴耶霸占了水，他用不完时放掉也不让我们用，你们真是把我们救了！”因此，军民关系极为融洽，农民也积极帮助部队解决生产中的困难。部队在喀什噶尔和叶尔羌两河流域展开垦种时，农民像迎接亲人一样地欢迎他们。在生产座谈会中，部队虚心地向维族老农请教，老农们也诚恳地讲解。每天晚上，驻地附近很多的维族青年自动来给部队讲解当地生产的一些事情。某部驻地的农民在七百亩分散的荒地上，一处一处地向战士们讲述土质的常识，纠正了部队一些不切实际的计划。如某部驻地附近荒了五十年的一百三十多亩地上，原来计划种胡麻，后来根据农民的意见改种了麦子。有一次某单位修水渠时缺乏经验，水冲了出来，农民们看见了急忙脱衣下渠，帮助修理。在农民们的指导和帮助下，三天内修好一条长千余米的水渠。一次某部战士们正在自己拉着耙耙地，农民先米希丁看见了，就自动将他的牛牵来借给部队用，接着还有很多农民也牵了牛来帮忙。
