　　Beijing Tram Company Civil Engineering Class
    Replacement of Diamond Crossover Frog Completed Ten Days Ahead of Schedule
    [Reported by this newspaper] The civil engineering class of the Beijing Tram Company Engineering Department completed the project of dismantling and replacing the diamond crossover frog and repairing 288 meters of curved track at Qianmen ten days ahead of schedule, saving 292 workdays. The project was originally scheduled to start on March 16th and be completed on April 5th, with a total of 640 workdays. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers, it was not only completed ten days ahead of schedule on March 26th, but only 348 workdays were used, and an additional 53.6 meters of curved track were replaced. In the past 20 years, the cross and large diamond crossover tracks have been contracted to outside iron factories, which cost a lot of money. Now they are doing it themselves. When the diamond crossover frog was first replaced, the tram cars still swayed a bit when passing through. Foreman Duan Hai made a reasonable suggestion to weld the areas in the middle of the two crosses where there was no steel padding. After a trial run, the results were good.

　　京电车公司土木课
    拆换井字岔心  提前十日完成
    【本报讯】北京电车公司工程处土木课在前门拆换井字岔心及整修弯道二八八公尺工程提前十日完成，并省工二九二个。该工程原计划自三月十六日开工四月五日完工，共计用工六四○个。由于全体工人的努力，不但提前十日于三月二十六日完工，用工人数亦只用三四八个，且多换了五三·六公尺的弯道。按过去二十余年来轨道十字及大井字的交叉轨道都是包给外面铁工厂承做，花钱很多。现在他们都是自己来做。井字岔心刚一换上时行车通过还有些摆动。领班段海提出了把两个十字中间没有垫钢的地方用电焊堆焊起的合理建议，经试作后，结果良好。
