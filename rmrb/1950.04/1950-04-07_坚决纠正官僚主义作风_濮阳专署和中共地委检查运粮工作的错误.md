　　Resolutely Correct Bureaucratic Work Style
    Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and CCP Prefectural Committee Examine Errors in Grain Transportation Work
    [Our Newspaper] The Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the CCP Puyang Local Committee, of Pingyuan Province, have each conducted investigations into the incidents of deaths of people and livestock during the grain transportation last winter, and have submitted reports to the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government and the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee respectively.
    The investigation report of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office is as follows:
    During the autumn grain requisition and storage, the prefectural leadership did not pay enough attention to the grain transportation work, and did not conduct thorough research. Only the district warehouse convened a grain transportation meeting, and the prefectural负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge/responsible person) did not attend. Although some issues that should be noted were raised at the meeting, they were not well discussed. The people who attended the meeting went back and made arrangements in a perfunctory manner. For example, the directors of the Puyang and Hua County warehouses attended the meeting but did not have good discussions with the county负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge/responsible person). The district warehouse also did not report the deployment situation to the prefectural commissioner's office. Later, the prefectural commissioner's office asked the district warehouse twice, and the comrade from the district warehouse said, "No problems have occurred." After that, no further questions were asked.
    Objectively speaking, there is no reason for the deaths of livestock during this grain transportation. The environment was stable, the task was not urgent, and although the journey was a bit long, it was much shorter than last year's transportation to the Longhai Railway, and it did not even involve crossing the Yellow River. Last year, tens of millions of catties of grain were transported to the Longhai Railway, and not so many livestock died. This year, more than a hundred animals died in just two counties. This fully demonstrates our lack of responsibility to the people and the country.
    In terms of leadership, there was no organized unified leading body for this grain transportation work, and responsibilities were not clearly defined. Therefore, when problems occurred, no one was responsible for solving them, and people shirked responsibility. This grain transportation was disorganized, not centralized. It involved all kinds of grain, and at the receiving point, some were received first and others were received later, and some were not received until the time arrived. The reception was not active (e.g., Daokou Station only received 7,000 catties a day), which delayed the time, and the masses suffered from hunger and cold. This shows a lack of mass perspective.
    When deploying this work, the specific difficulties were not considered, and the approach was simply based on the task, thinking that it would be good as long as the delivery was fast. Specific problems were not solved, such as food and lodging stations and fodder for livestock.
    The bureaucratic work style of the prefectural leadership is also a cause of this unfortunate event. After the work was deployed, no one was organized to go down to inspect it. It was not until Daokou reported the death of eight livestock that two section chiefs were sent to inspect it, but this did not attract much attention, and the first inspection did not clarify the matter. For example, in Puyang City, where the prefectural commissioner's office is located, there was a phenomenon where peasants brought grain to the warehouse, but the warehouse rejected it for being substandard and told them to take it back. The prefectural commissioner's office did not conduct timely inspections, and these problems were not resolved well.
    Due to these bad ideologies and work styles, the interests of the masses and state property were seriously damaged. We hereby request that the provincial government impose penalties and publicize them in the newspaper.
    We have decided:
    1. To compensate the masses for the dead livestock and apologize to the masses.
    2. To resolutely correct the bureaucratic work style in the future leadership, strengthen organizational leadership, thoroughly inspect the work, and strengthen the education of cadres in cherishing national property and protecting the interests of the people.
    3. To strictly protect public grain, constantly supervise and inspect, resolutely correct the careless work style, and establish a precise and meticulous work style.
    4. To adjust the cadres of the finance and grain departments and strengthen the leadership of the finance and economics departments.
    The Puyang Prefectural Committee's investigation report is as follows:
    In the autumn requisition and storage in the Puyang Prefecture, four people died, five were injured, and more than one hundred livestock died. The prefectural committee believes that the heinous incidents that caused such significant losses to the masses were due to serious bureaucracy and a lack of mass perspective in the leadership.
    When the autumn requisition was initially deployed, it coincided with the communication of the resolutions of the First Party Congress. The main energies of the prefectural committee and the county and district levels were focused on meetings. Insufficient attention and discussion were given to the autumn requisition task, and it was not specifically grasped and implemented. Furthermore, the favorable conditions for completing the autumn requisition were overestimated. Therefore, the occurrence of problems was not prevented in advance. When one person died and eight livestock died at Daokou Grain Station, the matter was still not seriously investigated. Extremely absurd arguments among some financial and economic cadres, such as "livestock lack exercise," "selling meat is more profitable than selling cattle," and "hoping to die so as to compensate less," were only criticized verbally and not effectively educated and inspected. The losses of the masses were not seriously investigated and compensated, so the development of the situation was not stopped early. At the same time, the provincial party committee was not promptly reported to, and the aftermath was not handled properly, resulting in such huge and irreparable losses to the Party and the people. Therefore, the prefectural committee requests that the provincial party committee impose penalties.
    In addition, we believe that Comrade Li Lige, as a member of the prefectural committee, was assigned to take charge of the autumn requisition work and bears a greater responsibility. Moreover, his personal views are extremely incorrect, and he has a sympathetic attitude toward the absurd arguments of lower-level cadres, which has a significant impact on the development of the situation. The prefectural commissioner's office was directly responsible for the damage to public grain in Changyuan, and Comrade Lige was also directly responsible. In order to educate cadres and clarify responsibilities, the prefectural committee suggests that Comrade Lige be given a public warning and that the administration give him a demerit.
    We express condolences and provide comfort to the affected masses. For the dead and injured livestock, we suggest that the prefectural commissioner's office convene a special meeting, and responsible cadres should personally apologize to the masses and provide serious and reasonable compensation to facilitate production. We will educate the entire party on the above lessons and educate and deal with the relevant cadres separately.

### 坚决纠正官僚主义作风  濮阳专署和中共地委检查运粮工作的错误

　　坚决纠正官僚主义作风
    濮阳专署和中共地委检查运粮工作的错误
    【本报讯】平原省濮阳专署和中共濮阳地方委员会，分别对去冬运粮中死人死牲口的事件作了检查，并分别向平原省人民政府及中共平原省委员会作了报告。
    濮阳专署的检查报告如下：
    在秋征运粮入库时，专署领导上对运粮工作没有重视，没有很好地研究，只是区库召开了一个运粮会议，专署负责人亦未参加；虽在会议上提出应注意的一些问题，但没很好讨论；参加会议的人回去就马马虎虎布置下去了。如濮阳、滑县仓库主任参加了会议，回去没和县的负责人很好的商谈。区库亦未向专署报告过布置情况；后来专署向区库问过两次，区库同志说：“没发生问题”，此后就没再问过。
    这次运粮死牲口的事，从客观上来说，是没有任何理由的。环境安定，任务不急，虽路途远些，但较之去年运陇海路时近的多，而且也不过黄河。去年往陇海路运了几千万斤粮，也没有死了这样多的牲口，今年两个县就死了百余头。这充分说明了我们对人民对国家是缺乏责任心的。
    这次运粮工作，从领导上来说，没有组织统一的领导机构，没明确责任，因此发生问题没人负责解决，互相推诿。这次运粮是杂乱的，不是集中起来运。其中什么粮食都有，送到接受地点先收这后收那，甚至不到时间不收；在接收中也不积极（如道口站一天只收七千斤），这样耽误了时间，群众挨了饿受了冻。这就是没有群众观念。
    布置这次工作时，对具体困难没考虑，单纯从任务出发，认为只要送的快就好。其中具体问题没解决，如食宿站和牲口的草料等。
    专署领导上的官僚主义也是发生这次不幸事件的原因。工作布置后没有组织人下去检查，直到道口报告死了八头牲口，才派了两个科长去检查，但并没有引起高度注意，第一次检查就没把事情搞清楚。又如在专署所在地濮阳城，就发生了农民送粮食到仓库，仓库嫌孬不收又叫拉回去的现象，专署未及时检查，都没获得很好解决。
    由于以上这些不好的思想作风，以致严重地损害了群众利益及国家财产。据此请省府给予处分，并登报公布
    我们决定：
    一、对群众死的牲口给以赔偿，并向群众承认错误。
    二、今后在领导上坚决纠正官僚主义作风，加强组织领导，深入地检查工作，加强干部爱护祖国财产与爱护人民利益的教育。
    三、严加保护公粮，经常督促检查，坚决纠正粗枝大叶的工作作风，树立精密细致的工作作风。
    四、调整财粮部门之干部，加强对财经部门之领导。
    濮阳地委检查报告如下：
    濮阳专区在秋征入仓中，死四人伤五人，并死牲口一百余头。地委认为所以造成对群众如此重大损失的罪恶事件，是由于领导上的严重官僚主义及其缺乏群众观念所致。
    秋征开始布置下来，正值传达第一次党代会决议，地委与县、区主要精力都在开会，对秋征任务未能予以足够的注意与讨论，更未具体地加以掌握贯彻，且过高的估计了完成秋征的有利条件，因而对问题的发生事前未能加以防范。到开始发现道口粮站死一人、死牲口八头时，仍未能认真地加以追究。对部分财经干部中极端荒谬的论调：“牲口缺乏锻炼”、“卖肉比卖牛利大”、“想死后以少赔多”等，仅在口头上批判，未能予以有效的教育与检查。对群众损失，未进行认真的调查与赔偿，因而未能及早停止事态的发展；同时又未能及时向省委报告与进行善后工作，以致对党对人民造成如此巨大而又不可补偿的损失。为此，地委请求省委予以处分。
    另外，我们认为李立格同志为地委委员，分工掌握秋征工作，责任较大；且其本人观点极不正确，并对下级干部的荒谬论调有同情态度，对事态的发展实不无关系。长垣公粮的损坏，专署直接负责者亦为立格同志，为了教育干部、严明责任，地委意见应给立格同志当众警告之处分，并建议行政上给以记大过一次的处分。
    对于受害的群众，我们予以慰问抚恤；对死伤牲畜，我们建议专署开专门会议，负责干部亲自向群众道歉赔罪，并予以认真合理的赔偿，以利生产。并将以上教训在全党进行教育，对有关干部分别进行教育处理。
