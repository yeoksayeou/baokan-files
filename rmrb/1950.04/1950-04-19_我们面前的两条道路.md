　　The Two Roads Before Us
    By Vice-Dean Johnson of Canterbury, England Translated by Fu Ying
    Peace is the most important issue in the world. Everyone needs peace. If we embark on the road to peace, the main problems in Britain, such as housing, health, education, and security, can all be solved immediately.
    Britain spends 800 million pounds annually on war – and perhaps soon it will increase to 1 billion pounds. With guaranteed peace, military expenditure could be reduced to below 250 million pounds.
    The 550 million pounds saved each year could build 1,200 houses a day, or six first-class schools, or two or three of the best hospitals.
    Moreover, with guaranteed peace, we could free hundreds of thousands of young people from the army and enable them to receive real education or engage in beneficial production.
    However, if we embark on the road to war, we will fall into the abyss. Atomic bombs will fly everywhere. All demons will be unleashed.
    In Hiroshima, an atomic bomb killed 70,000 people instantly and injured more than 200,000. The babies born afterward were all deformed.
    The destructive power of the hydrogen bomb will be even greater. It costs millions of pounds to manufacture such weapons, and they have no other useful by-products.
    Other weapons have been proposed and are being prepared: bacteriological weapons, which are cheaper to manufacture and perhaps even more terrible and frightening in their effect.
    We have two roads before us – war or peace?
    What is hindering the road to peace? Only one obstacle. That is hatred of the Soviet Union. It is the determination to maintain privileges at any cost, to limit the spread of socialism and communism.
    Therefore, they blame Russia. Therefore, the newspapers clamor: Russia is expanding; Russia wants to dominate the world; Russia is planning war.
    This is not true at all. Russia is most concerned about peace. Stalin made peace proposals to Roosevelt Jr., Wallace, Stassen, and Smith in 1946, 1947, and 1948.
    People say this is just empty talk. This is nonsense. There are six concrete facts that can prove that Stalin's peace proposals are genuine.
    First, Russia wants peace because Russia needs peace. Russia is dedicated to maximizing its industrial potential based on the latest scientific achievements (including atomic energy), and sees war and war preparations as an unbearable obstacle.
    Second, Russia's economy welcomes peace because Russia's economy can fully consume what it produces. Increased production raises everyone's living standards. A planned economy will never have unemployment.
    Third, the Russian Five-Year Plan shows that Russia neither plans nor expects war. The Five-Year Plan invests more funds in Latvia (which is close to the West and vulnerable to attack) than in Moscow. The Five-Year Plan fearlessly rebuilds houses, universities, hospitals, and factories, rather than building tanks and planes.
    Fourth, Russia's budget for war only accounts for 17 percent of its total, even less than before 1940.
    Fifth, Russia has never talked about war, never threatened to bomb other people with atomic bombs. Russia has organized a great peace movement within its own country. Hitler talked about peace abroad, but talked about war at home.
    Sixth, Russia firmly supports the movement to declare atomic bombs and all weapons of mass destruction illegal. Russia advocates banning atomic bombs, disarmament, and production for peace.
    Russia rejected the Baruch Plan. The Baruch Plan has ulterior motives and is detrimental to Russia's industrial development.
    The Baruch Plan called for the establishment of an international commission in which the United States would have a decisive majority. This commission would have complete control over the world's atomic energy resources and would have the right to inspect every country (providing valuable intelligence to the US Army and Air Force) before they even discussed ceasing the production of atomic bombs.
    Russia put forward its atomic bomb control plan. Abolish all weapons of mass destruction; everyone has the freedom to use the atom for peaceful purposes, with effective inspection at the same time. These are Russia's peace proposals.
    Now let's look at the West. Does the Western economy welcome guaranteed peace? No, it doesn't.
    The United States only consumes 75 percent of its production. Last year, industrial production fell by 22 percent, coal production fell by 31 percent, railway freight volume fell by 20 percent, and department store sales fell by 12 to 14 percent. There are now 4.5 million unemployed people in the United States.
    American newspapers create rumors that Russia is preparing to launch a war to promote massive military expansion. Despite massive military expansion, the American economy is still declining. Despite huge military orders, the economy continues to decline.
    The United States rejects planned economies. American capitalists are also afraid of peace, because peace would make war equipment useless.
    The American economy is a war economy, while the Russian economy is a peace economy. Therefore, they repeatedly shout loudly that Russia is expanding and that Russia wants to dominate the world, as a smokescreen.
    This is false. Russia has not expanded. Today, the territory of the Soviet Union is smaller than the territory of Tsarist Russia. The Yalta Agreement agreed that Russia would restore its territories in the Balkans that it had lost after World War I, but Churchill said: "Russia has in fact accepted a border that has moved 200 to 300 miles to the east."
    But it is the United States that is expanding. The United States has obtained 489 air bases around the Soviet Union, all strategic bases for attacking the Soviet Union.
    The United States' budget for war accounts for 75 percent of its total.
    The US Marshall Plan rebuilds capitalism on the basis of Wall Street's monopoly, limits economic recovery, and hinders industrial development. The Marshall Plan rebuilds the Nazi war machine.
    According to the Atlantic Pact, the United States supplies weapons and Europe supplies soldiers to fight the Soviet Union.
    Britain follows the United States, rushing along the road to war. We must stop, and we can stop. We can show friendship to Russia and accept Stalin's repeated peace proposals.
    We can open the door to East-West trade, exchanging our industrial products for the food, timber, and raw materials we need.
    We can cut war spending to pre-war standards, as Russia has done. We can save hundreds of millions of pounds and cut the shackles of the Marshall Plan.
    We can build a new and ever-increasing standard of living for everyone, as Russia and the Eastern European countries have done.
    We can only achieve peace through understanding with Russia.
    We can only achieve prosperity through the planning of socialism and communism. (Translated from the British London "Workers' Daily")

### 我们面前的两条道路

　　我们面前的两条道路
    英国坎特布雷副主教约翰逊著  福英译
    和平是世界上第一重要的问题。人人需要和平。跑上导向和平的路，英国的主要问题，如住宅、康健、教育、安全等问题，全都能立即解决。
    英国每年用在战争上的费用达八亿金镑——也许不久就会增至十亿金镑。有了和平保障，军事费用就能降为二亿五千镑以下。
    每年节省五亿五千金镑，每天就能建筑一千二百座住宅，或建造六座头等的学校，或建造二个或三个最好的医院。
    不仅如此。有了和平保障，我们就能够把军队中成十万的青年解放出来，使他们受真正的教育或从事有利的生产。
    可是，如果我们跑上导向战争的路，我们就将堕入深渊。原子弹将横飞。一切恶魔都将跑出来了。
    在广岛，一颗原子弹片刻之间致七万人于死命，伤者二十几万人。随后养下来的婴孩都成为畸形的人。
    氢弹之破坏力将更大。制造这种武器要用好几百万的金钱，而毫无其他有用的副产物。
    其他的武器，已有人提出，且已准备着：细菌武器，制造的用费较廉，而其作用也许更厉害可怕。
    我们面前有两条道路——战争呢？和平呢？
    导向和平之路上有什么阻碍？只有一个阻碍。就是仇视苏联。就是决心不论代价如何都要保持特权，要限止社会主义及共产主义的散布。
    所以，他们归罪于俄国。所以，报纸叫嚣着：俄国扩张；俄国要统治世界；俄国计划战争。
    这完全不是事实。俄国最关心的是和平。斯大林在一九四六年、一九四七年、一九四八年向小罗斯福、向华莱士、向史塔生、向斯密士都提出和平建议。
    人家说，这只是空话。这话是胡说八道。有六件确确实实的事实，可以证明斯大林的和平建议是真实的。
    第一，俄国想要和平，因为俄国需要和平。俄国专心致志于根据最新的科学成就（包括原子能）来提高工业潜能至最高可能水准，认为战争及战争准备是一个令人难忍的障碍。
    第二，俄国的经济欢迎和平，因为俄国的经济能够把所生产的东西完全消费。生产提高，使大家生活标准提高。计划经济永远不会有失业。
    第三，俄国五年计划表明俄国既没有计划战争也不预期战争，五年计划投于拉脱维亚（很近西方，易遭攻击）的资金多于莫斯科。五年计划毫不畏惧地重新建造住宅、大学、医院、工厂，而不是建筑坦克、飞机。
    第四，俄国预算用于战争的，只占其百分之十七，比一九四○年以前的还要少。
    第五，俄国从没有讲要战争，从没有威吓要以原子弹轰炸别国人民。俄国在本国国内组织了和平大运动。希特勒在国外讲和平，但在国内却讲战争。
    第六，俄国坚决赞助把原子弹以及一切大量屠杀的武器宣布为非法的运动。俄国主张禁用原子弹，主张解除武装，主张为和平生产。
    俄国拒绝巴鲁区计划。巴鲁区计划别有用心，有害于俄国工业发展。
    巴鲁区计划要求成立一个国际委员会，美国在该委员会中占有决定的多数。由此一委员会完全控制世界的原子能资源，且在他们甚至没有讨论停止制造原子弹以前，有权检查每一国家（把有价值的情报供给美国陆军与空军）。
    俄国提出它的原子弹管制计划。废除一切大量屠杀的武器；人人有在和平用途上使用原子之自由，同时又有有效的检查。这些就是俄国的和平建议。
    我们现在看看西方吧。西方的经济欢迎有保证的和平吗？并不。
    美国只消费其生产的百分之七十五。去年，工业生产降低百分之二十二，煤的生产降百分之三十一，铁路运货量降百分之二十，百货商店售货额降百分之十二至十四。现在美国失业人数达四百五十万人。
    美国报纸制造俄国准备发动战争的谣言来推动大量扩张军备。虽然大量扩张军备，美国经济仍然衰落。虽然有巨大的军事定货，经济继续下降。
    美国拒绝计划经济。美国资本家也怕和平，和平会使战争设备成为废物。
    美国的经济是战争经济，而俄国的经济是和平经济。因此，重复高声呼叫，说俄国扩张，说俄国要统治世界，作为烟幕。
    这话是假的。俄国并没有扩张。今天苏联的疆域比沙俄的疆域为小。雅尔达协定同意俄国恢复其在第一次大战后所失去的巴尔干的领土，但邱吉尔说：“俄国在事实上接受了向东移了二百至三百英里的疆界。”
    但扩张的是美国。美国在苏联周围获得了四百八十九处飞机基地，都是进攻苏联时的战略基地。
    美国预算用于战争的占其百分之七十五。
    美国马歇尔计划在华尔街独占之基础上来重建资本主义，限制经济复兴，阻碍工业发展。马歇尔计划重建纳粹战争机器。
    照大西洋公约，美国供给武器，欧洲供给士兵，来打苏联。
    英国跟着美国走，循着向战争之路急进。我们必须停止，也能够停止。我们能向俄国表示友好，接受斯大林的屡次重复的和平建议。
    我们能够打开东西贸易之门，以我们的工业品换取我们所需的食物、木材、和原料。
    我们削减战争费用至战前标准，如俄国然，我们就能节省几亿金镑，并切断马歇尔计划的束缚绳索。
    我们能够建造一个新的和不断增高的人人享受的生活标准，如俄国及东欧诸国然。
    我们只有与俄国谅解，才能获得和平。
    我们只有经由社会主义和共产主义的计划，才能获得繁荣。（译自英国伦敦《工人日报》）
