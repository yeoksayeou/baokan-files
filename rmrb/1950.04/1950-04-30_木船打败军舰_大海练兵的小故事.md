　　Wooden Boat Defeats Warship
    —A Small Story of Sea Training
    One, "There's really nothing to it!"
    On the evening of February 21st, when several boats of the Second Battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army were training at sea south of Dafangshan Island, the wind suddenly stopped. Other boats returned by rowing, but the boat led by Platoon Deputy Lu Xiangyun of the Fourth Company had no oars, so they had to drop anchor and wait for the wind, stopping in the sea.
    A wind rose in the middle of the night, but it was a northeast wind, and the boat was blown further and further southwest.
    As dawn approached, a southwest wind rose. As soon as they set sail and were turning around, they suddenly discovered an enemy warship approaching from the southwest. Platoon Deputy Lu immediately calculated in his mind how to organize the boat's firepower to strike the enemy.
    The ship was moving very fast, and by the time the small boat had completely turned around, the warship was not far away. Platoon Deputy Lu said to everyone, "Now it's a life-or-death struggle, it's either you die or I live. Quickly take off your military hats and go into the cabin, calm down, prepare your weapons, and when it comes, we will open fire!" Communist Party member Chai Yulin also shouted, "Comrades, get into the cabin, prepare your firearms, and give it a sudden attack!"
    The enemy fired a shot first, but no one paid any attention to it. Then a cannon fired, and two shots hit the boat's side and anchor winch. But the whole boat, under the encouragement of Platoon Deputy Lu and Communist Party member Chai Yulin, even the new comrades who were a little uneasy were not alarmed. The enemy warship sailed closer and closer, and when it was about 100 meters away, it circled half a circle around the small boat. Dian Shen and Meng Xianzhiboth could not help wanting to fire, but Lu Xiangyun held them back. He remembered the experience of the East China brother unit's wooden boat fighting the warship: "Get close and attack fiercely."
    Seeing that the small boat had not moved after being hit by two shots, the warship became even bolder and approached even closer. At this time, even the number of cannons on the warship, the size of the cannons, and the heads of the people in the windows could be seen clearly. Comrade Lu Xiangyun then ordered to open fire. A light machine gun, four (original manuscript incomplete) and two rifles all spoke at once, and the rifle grenades hit the enemy on the warship, causing them to roll and crawl. The brave Comrade Lu Xiangyun shouted loudly: "Do it neatly!" The enemy warship was caught off guard and panicked, dared not fight back, and turned tail and fled southeast at full power. It was not until it escaped from our fire net that it fired a few more "deflated cannons."
    After driving away the bandit ship, everyone quickly repaired the boat. Comrade Lu Xiangyun immediately called everyone together for a meeting. Everyone's morale was even higher. After eating some porridge, they cleaned their guns and prepared to fight again.
    Later, the guard company stationed on Dafangshan Island discovered this situation and took the nine of them back. After returning, Platoon Deputy Lu said: "Before fighting the warship, I didn't know how powerful it was. After fighting it, I realized that there is really nothing to it. As long as you muster up the courage to fight it, it will really be 'cowardly'!"
  Two, "Fighting excellently!"
    On March 16th, Squad Leader Xia Deyu of the Second Company led twelve sailors on a two-masted sailing boat to Shuidong to collect rice. Near Dafangji Island, they encountered a stupid enemy warship.
    The squad leader said: "Lu Xiangyun's heroic boat was won by fighting, we are determined to create the second heroic boat!" The sailors also responded: "Yes! We'll see who's iron and who's steel now!" The squad leader saw that machine gunner Zhao Wenzhang had already set up the machine gun. Helmsman Mou Jing patted his chest and said, "Squad leader, don't worry, with me, nothing will go wrong!"
    Before they were even half a kilometer apart, the enemy warship's machine guns opened fire, and shells exploded with a bang beside them. The new comrade Li Yuanfu said after hearing the sound, "It's a mountain gun!"
    "Mountain gun!" Zhao Weizhen said, "We're not afraid of榴弹炮!"
    The enemy warship got closer and closer, and the artillery fire became more and more intense. When they were only two hundred meters apart, the ferocious enemy warship suddenly turned sideways, and light and heavy weapons fired together, bullets whizzing overhead. But the helmsman had already cleverly steered the small boat to the stern of the enemy warship, so that it could not use its firepower. The enemy warship barely managed to turn around, but the small boat turned to its rear again.
    Only a hundred meters away, Xia Deyu shouted "Fire!" The firepower on the small boat fired all at once, hitting the enemy on the deck, who dropped their weapons and screamed and desperately squeezed towards the cabin, while accelerating their speed to escape. The small sailing boat of the Second Company was unwilling to let go, and with its sails full, it flew forward in pursuit, chasing for more than five kilometers before returning because the sail ropes broke. The leaders and comrades on the shore were already waiting. The residents also flocked over, excitedly using their fists to illustrate the flexible movements of the small boat fighting the warship, while giving a thumbs up and smiling, saying: "Fighting excellently!"

　　木船打败军舰
    ——大海练兵的小故事
    一、“真没什么了不起！”
    二月二十一日黄昏，解放军某部二营几只船在大方山岛南的大海中练兵时，风忽然停了。别的船都摇着橹回来了，只有四连排副卢相云同志带的船没有橹，只好下锚等风，停在大海里。
    半夜起了风，可是是东北风，船反被吹得愈向西南去了。
    天快亮时，西南风起了。刚开船，正在转弯掉头时，忽然发现西南方有一只敌人的军舰开来。卢排副心里马上盘算着怎样组织船上的火力打击敌人。
    那只船走得很快，等到小船完全掉回头来，兵舰已经离不远了。卢排副向大家说：“现在是生死斗争，不是你死就是我活，快摘掉军帽子进舱，沉着气，把武器准备好，等它来我们就开火！”共产党员柴玉林也喊道：“同志们进舱，准备好火器，给它一个突然迎击！”
    敌人先打了一枪，谁也没理它。接着炮响了，有两炮打伤了船帮和锚车。但是全船在卢排副和共产党员柴玉林的鼓励下，就连本来有点沉不住气的新同志也没有惊慌。敌舰愈驶愈近，到了距离约百米时，围着小船绕了半个圈，殿深和孟现芝两人忍不住了要打，被卢相云按住了。他记住得华东兄弟部队木船打兵舰的经验是：“靠近猛打”。
    军舰见小船中了两炮还没有动静，胆子更大了，愈发靠近过来。这时，连兵舰上有几门炮，炮有多大，和窗户里的人脑袋都能看得清清楚楚，卢相云同志才下令开火。一挺轻机，四（原稿不全）两支步枪一起说话，并开的枪榴弹打得军舰上敌人连滚带爬。勇敢的卢相云同志大声喊着：“弄利落点！”敌舰遭到意外的打击，仓皇失措，不敢应战，开足了马力掉头向东南逃去。一直到逃出我火力网后，才又打了几响“泄气炮”。
    把匪舰打跑后，大家很快的补好了船，卢相云同志立刻又召集大家开会。大家的情绪更高了，做了点稀饭吃后，擦干净了枪，准备再战。
    后来，驻在大方山的警卫连，发现了这个情况，把他们九人接了回去。回来后卢排副说：“没有打重舰以前，不知道他有多厉害，打过了才知道军舰真没有什么了不起，只要壮起胆子来和它干，它就真‘熊’了！”
  二、“打得顶呱呱！”
    三月十六日，二连班长夏德禹领着十二名水手乘着一只两篷两桅的帆船到水东去领米，在大放鸡岛附近碰上一只蠢头蠢脑的敌舰。
    班长说：“卢相云的英雄船是打出来的，我们坚决创造第二英雄船！”水手们也应声说：“对！是铁是钢现在才看清楚！”班长一看，机枪手赵文章早已把机枪架好了。舵手牟景拍着胸膛他说：“班长你放心，有我在保证出不了岔子！”
    还相隔一里多路，敌舰上的机关枪就开火了，炮弹也在旁边轰的一声炸开了。新同志李元富听出声音说：“是山炮！”
    “山炮！”赵为真说：“榴弹炮也不怕它！”
    敌舰愈靠愈近，炮火也愈打愈激烈。相隔只有二百米了，凶顽的敌舰忽然横过身来，轻重火器一齐开火，子弹嗖嗖地从头顶飞过。可是舵手早已机警地把小船一下驶到了敌舰尾，叫它有火力也用不上。敌舰好容易转过身来，可是小船又转到它后面去了。
    只有一百米了，夏德禹一声喊“打！”小船上的火力齐发，打得舱面上的敌人丢下火器吱哇乱叫没命的向舱口挤，一面加速马力开船逃。二连小帆船那里肯放松，鼓满船篷就飞速向前追，直追下十余里，因为篷绳断了才回来。岸上首长和战友们都早已经在等着。居民们也蜂拥过来，兴奋地用两只拳头比划着小船打军舰的灵活动作，一面伸出大拇指笑着说：“打得顶呱呱！”
