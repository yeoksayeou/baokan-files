　　Zhangjiakou Public-Operated No. 1 Flour Mill
    Production Plan Deeply Rooted in Workshops
    Average Monthly Cost Reduction Exceeds Five Percent
    [Report from this newspaper] Zhangjiakou Public-Operated No. 1 Flour Mill, through in-depth publicity and education, has thoroughly implemented the factory's production plan into the workshops, enabling workers to clearly understand the goals of hard work and production. The first quarter's production plan has been successfully overfulfilled. In three months, flour production exceeded the original plan by 17,953 catties, and the average monthly cost reduction was 5.5%, saving a total of 18,970 catties of millet. According to the provincial Department of Industry's call to reduce costs by 5%, the mill formulated the first quarter plan. First, Party, government, and labor union cadres conducted separate publicity and mobilization, so that every worker recognized the importance of planned production. The plan was then assigned to various workshop groups according to different circumstances, in order to assess each person's work performance. Due to the clear production goals and strict assessment system, production efficiency has generally improved. In January, costs were reduced by 1%, equivalent to 1,131 catties of millet. In February, workshops began to research technical improvements. For example, the wheat washing team, led by team leader Rong Liansheng, washed an additional 200 catties of wheat per day. As the quality of wheat washing improved, the working hours of the flour milling workshop were shortened. Previously, two shifts day and night milled 4,400 catties of wheat in 24 hours; in February, this increased to 4,600 catties of wheat in 20 hours, and the flour yield rate also increased from the original plan of 77.5% to 79%. In total, the cost reduction in February was 7.87%, saving a total of 7,767 catties of millet. In March, costs were reduced by 7.66%, saving 10,072 catties of millet. Currently, all factory employees have formed groups to create the second quarter production plan, and the workers are determined to create greater production achievements to welcome the first Labor Day after the establishment of the Central People's Government.

　　张垣公营第一面粉厂
    生产计划深入车间
    平均每月降低成本百分之五强
    【本报讯】张垣公营第一面粉厂，经过深入宣传教育，把全厂生产计划具体贯彻到车间去，使工友们明确了努力生产的目标，第一季生产计划已胜利超额完成。三个月中，面粉产量超过原计划一七、九五三斤，每月平均降低成本百分之五·五，总计节省米一八、九七○斤。该厂根据省工业厅减低成本百分之五的号召，制订了第一季计划后，首先由党、政、工干部分别宣传动员，使每个工友都认识到计划生产的重要。并根据计划按不同情况分配到各车间小组，以便考核每人工作情况。由于明确了生产目标，严格了考核制，生产效率普遍提高，在一月份即减低成本百分之一，折米一、一三一斤。二月份，各车间即展开改进技术的研究，如洗麦组在组长荣连升带动下，每日多洗麦二百斤。由于洗麦质量提高，便缩短了制粉车间的工时，以前日夜二班二十四小时磨麦四千四百斤，二月份则升为二十小时磨麦四千六百斤，产粉率亦由原计划百分之七十七·五增达百分之七十九，总计二月份减低成本百分之七点八七，共省小米七、七六七斤。三月份减成本百分之七点六六，节省小米一○、○七二斤。现全厂职工已分组作了第二季生产计划，工友们决定创造更大的生产成绩，以迎接中央人民政府成立后的第一个劳动节。
