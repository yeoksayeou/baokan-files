Xinhua News Agency, Delhi (via TASS): The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Congress will hold a week of struggle for peace and democracy from April 23rd to May 1st.

    The Bihar Provincial Peace Committee and the Provincial Trade Union Congress have specifically called on local trade unions and all residents of the province to actively participate in the struggle for peace and democracy and the provincial peace conference to be held from May 13th to 14th.

    The appeal issued by the Bihar Provincial Trade Union Congress called on the working people to intensify the struggle against the American and British war-mongers and their accomplices in India. The appeal stated: Every step taken by the Nehru government is dictated by American and British imperialists. The Nehru government has established a reign of terror domestically in order to implement the military plans of the United States and Britain, and to destroy the national liberation struggle, the peace movement, and national independence and national revival. It loaned money and sent weapons to the British puppet, Ba Swe, in Burma. It is a member of the British imperial military bloc. It has actively participated in imperialist conspiracies in Nepal and Tibet. It is united with the Pakistani government in an effort to undermine and suppress the rising popular resistance. It attempts to pave the way for imperialist intervention in Bengal and Assam by massacring Muslims and inciting Indo-Pakistani war.

    The appeal calls for a persistent and concrete struggle for peace, so that the sinister plans of the new war instigators cannot be realized.

    Farmers' organizations in Bihar accepted the invitation of the Bihar Provincial Peace Committee and called on peasants and agricultural workers to send representatives to the Provincial Peace Conference.

　　印争取和平周开始
    比哈尔工会大会号召工会及全体居民加紧反对美英战贩及其印度同伙斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社德里讯：全印和平大会常设委员会自四月二十三日至五月一日举行争取和平、民主斗争周。
    比哈尔省和平委员会与该省工会大会，特号召该省地方工会和全体居民，积极参加争取和平民主的斗争及五月十三日至十四日举行的全省和平大会。
    比哈尔省工会大会发出的呼吁书，号召劳动人民加紧对美、英战争贩子以及他们在印度的同伙们斗争。呼吁书称：尼赫鲁政府所采取的每一个步骤，都是美英帝国主义者所指使的。尼赫鲁政府在国内建立了恐怖统治，其目的在推行美、英军事计划，摧残民族解放斗争、和平运动以及民族独立和民族的复兴。它对缅甸的英国傀儡达钦努贷款，送给他武器。它是大英帝国军事集团中的一员。它积极地参与了帝国主义在尼伯尔与西藏的阴谋活动。它和巴基斯坦政府联合在一起，竭力破坏和镇压日趋高涨的人民反抗。它企图借屠杀回教徒与煽起印巴战争，为对孟加拉与阿萨密进行帝国主义干涉而铺平道路。
    呼吁书号召为和平作坚持不渝的具体的斗争。使新战争挑拨者的罪恶计划不得实现。
    比哈尔省的农民团体接受了比哈尔省和平委员会的邀请，并号召农民和农业工人派代表出席该省和平大会。
