Chahar Military Region Garrison Second Regiment
    Proposes Compensation Measures to the Government for Damaging Ci'er Mountain Timber

    [This News] According to a February circular from the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, some companies of the Garrison Second Regiment of the Chahar Military Region, lacking an overall national perspective and violating the government's policy of protecting state property, seriously damaged the timber on Ci'er Mountain, a scenic spot in Zhangjiakou City. The military region has issued a disciplinary order regarding this incident. During the autumn firewood collection by the troops from September to October last year, the Garrison Second Regiment's direct units, Youth Company, Artillery Company, Medical Team, and the Second Battalion's Machine Gun Company, Fifth Company, and Sixth Company, in order to "engage in production and improve meals," arbitrarily felled trees in the Yunquan Temple area of Ci'er Mountain, a scenic spot in Zhangjiakou, on more than twenty-nine occasions. Preliminary investigations show that a total of 387 mature trees with a diameter of three to five inches or more were felled, along with 7,128 catties of branches and saplings. Most of Ci'er Mountain's 180-odd large trees, 500-odd medium-sized trees, nearly 10,000 saplings, and scenic firewood forests have been cut down. Prior to this very serious incident of destruction, when the Garrison Second Regiment mobilized all officers and soldiers to collect firewood, it neither explained the discipline of "no felling of forbidden mountains" nor clearly specified the specific locations for collecting firewood. When the troops felled trees on the forbidden mountains, due to the serious bureaucratic work style of the regimental leadership, they were unable to effectively stop it, giving this serious violation of policy and discipline an opportunity to occur. On October 4th last year, after the regimental headquarters first discovered that the troops were felling trees on Ci'er Mountain, it did not seriously handle the matter or report it to the military region, causing the mistake to continue to develop. For example, Kong Xianming, the commander of the Second Battalion's Machine Gun Company, personally led soldiers to the mountain to collect firewood, and, fearing being seen by superiors, dared not go through the main gate upon returning. Later, when the regimental headquarters went to inspect the companies, some companies hid the firewood; the cadres also concealed the matter and instructed their subordinates not to report it. Some units saw other units going up the mountain to collect firewood and fell trees, and, knowing that it violated discipline, did not report it to their superiors or raise objections, but adopted a cover-up attitude. This caused the destructive behavior to develop from a few units to most units, and from minor destruction to serious destruction.

　　察哈尔军区警二团
    为破坏赐儿山林木事向政府提出补偿办法
    【本报讯】据中共中央华北局二月份通报称，察哈尔军区警卫第二团部分连队，缺乏国家整体观念，违反政府保护国家财产政策，严重破坏张家口市名胜赐儿山林木。该军区对此事件已发布处分训令。在去年九月至十月秋季部队打柴时，察哈尔军区警二团团直、青年连、炮兵连、卫生队和二营机炮连、五连、六连等部，为了“搞生产，改善伙食”，任意砍伐张市名胜赐儿山云泉寺树木，先后达二十九次之多。据初步调查，计砍伐三至五寸以上成材树木三百八十七株，树枝及小树七千一百二十八斤。赐儿山一百八十余株大树，五百余株中等树木，近一万株小树及山景柴林，已大部被砍光。在这一非常严重的破坏事件发生之前，该警卫第二团发动全体指战员打柴，既未讲明“不准砍伐禁山”的纪律，又未明确具体规定打柴地点。在各部队砍伐禁山树木时，由于团领导干部存在严重的官僚主义作风，一直未能有效的加以制止，给这一严重破坏政策纪律的行为以可乘之隙。去年十月四日，团部第一次发觉部队砍伐赐儿山树木后，又未认真加以处理并报告军区，致使错误继续发展。如二营机炮连长孔宪明，亲自率领战士上山打柴，怕上级看见，打柴回来不敢走大门。后来团部去检查各连队，有些连队竟把柴收藏起来；干部亦隐瞒不说，并向下级布置不准反映。有些单位看到别的单位去山上打柴砍伐树木，明知违反纪律，但也不向上级报告，不提出反对意见，而采取包庇态度。致使破坏行为由少数单位发展到多数单位，由轻微的破坏发展到严重的破坏。
