　　Beijing Elementary Schools Improve Democratic Management
    Municipal Bureau of Education Instructs Schools to Correct the Tendency of Over-Emphasizing the Collective and "Laissez-faire" Learning

    [Our Newspaper's News] Reporter Mu Yang reports: Several deviations that have occurred in Beijing's elementary schools in the implementation of the democratic management system are being gradually corrected. In the year or so since the liberation of Beijing, elementary schools have made improvements in teaching content and methods: corporal punishment has been basically abolished, and the democratic management system is being gradually implemented; furthermore, student associations have been established to conduct extracurricular activities. School order is gradually becoming standardized. However, in the process of carrying out democratic management, many schools have experienced two deviations: First, an over-emphasis on the collective, resulting in excessive constraints on students' lives; and an over-emphasis on mutual assistance, creating a burden for some students. One good student from the Fifth District Central Elementary School had to wake up at five o'clock in the morning in order to help others during the day. Some schools even grouped naughty students into "bad groups," assigning good students to help them improve.

    Second, a "laissez-faire" attitude towards learning. Teachers are excessively relying on students' study groups. The essay topics and essay paragraph outlines of the Fifth District Liuli Temple Elementary School are also first decided by student discussions, resulting in students' essays becoming identical. Some teachers in a certain school even hand over the questions raised by students to small groups for "democratic" discussion, and when encountering differing opinions, adopt a "democratic" voting method, while the teachers themselves do not draw conclusions. The main reason for the above deviations is that some teachers have misunderstood the meaning of collectivism and mutual assistance; and mechanically transplanted the teaching method of "self-study as the main focus, tutoring as the supplement" to elementary schools, weakening or abandoning the proper role of teachers in children's education. For this reason, the Municipal Bureau of Education instructed all schools at the beginning of this semester to vigorously correct the above shortcomings. On the fourth of this month, at a joint meeting of principals and deans of central elementary schools, attention was once again drawn to correcting the above shortcomings.

　　京小学改进民主管理
    文教局指示各校纠正过分强调集体和学习自流的偏向
    【本报讯】记者穆扬报道：京市各小学在实施民主管理制度中所发生的若干偏向已在逐步纠正。北京解放后的一年多的过程中，各小学在教学内容和教导方法上都有了改进：体罚制度基本上废除了，民主管理制度在逐渐实行起来；并帮助学生建立了学生会，开展了课外活动。学校秩序逐渐步入了正规。但在开展民主管理的过程中，不少学校却发生了两个偏向：第一、过分强调集体，形成对学生生活上的过分的约束；并且过分强调互助，形成对一部分学生的负担，五区中心小学的一个好学生为了白天帮助别人，早晨要在五点钟就起床。某些学校更把顽皮学生编为“坏组”，指定好学生来帮助他们改好。
    第二、在学习上的放任自流。教师过分依赖学生们的学习小组。五区琉璃寺小学的作文题和作文段落提纲，也先由学生讨论决定，结果学生的作文成了千篇一律。某校的几位教师更把学生们提出的问题都交小组“民主”讨论，遇到分歧意见时采取“民主”表决方式，教师却不作结论。发生上述偏向的主要原因，是由于部分教师错误地理解集体与互助；并且机械地把“自学为主、辅导为辅”的教学方法搬到小学里来，减弱或放弃了教师在儿童教育中应有的地位。为此，市文教局于本学期开学之初即指示各校应大力纠正以上缺点。本月四日在中心小学校长，教导主任联席会上曾再次提出注意纠正以上缺点。
