The circle on the right is the design of the flag of the China Young Pioneers. The flag is red, and the five-pointed star and torch are yellow. (Due to printing limitations, this newspaper is unable to print in color; the black areas should be red, and the white areas should be yellow.) Red symbolizes revolutionary victory, the yellow five-pointed star symbolizes the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the torch symbolizes brightness.

The diagram on the left shows the proportions for making the flag.

The design of the large brigade flag is the same as the team flag. Its size is 90 cm high and 120 cm wide, with a yellow five-pointed star and torch in the center of the flag. The design of the medium brigade flag is as shown in the left figure, 60 cm high and 80 cm long, with one end cut into an isosceles triangle 20 cm high, with a yellow five-pointed star and torch in the flag. The small team flag is a right triangle 28 cm high and 59 cm wide at the base, with no pattern in the center of the flag. The color of all flags is red.

The China Young Pioneers Salute

How to perform the salute: The left hand with five fingers together, passes in front of the chest from bottom to top, stopping one and a half inches above the forehead.

Explanation of meaning: (1) Raising the right hand above the head means that the interests of the people are above everything else. (2) The five fingers represent the "Five Loves"—love of country, love of the people, love of labor, love of science, and cherishing public property. (3) The same as the salute of the International Young Pioneers.

Member Insignia

The China Young Pioneers uses the red scarf as the member insignia. It is made of red cloth into an isosceles triangle with one side one meter wide and the other two sides each 60 cm long.

How to tie it: (1) Drape the scarf over the shoulders, with the obtuse angle pointing towards the spine, with the right corner below the left corner, and the two corners crossed. (2) Bring the right corner in front of the left corner to the right, leaving the left corner still. (3) Pull the right corner out through the gap where the left and right corners cross, so that the right corner wraps around the left corner exactly once. (4) Pull the right corner out of this loop and tighten.

Meaning: (1) Red symbolizes revolutionary victory. (2) The same as the insignia of members of the International Young Pioneers.

Level Insignia for Team Leaders

The insignia for team leaders of the China Young Pioneers is a horizontal red strip of cloth sewn on the upper part of the left elbow. The strip is 1 cm high and 4 cm long. The head of the grand brigade wears three strips, the head of the middle brigade wears two strips, and the head of the small team wears one strip.

Member Admission Oath

I am a member of the China Young Pioneers. I swear under the team flag: I am determined to abide by the team charter, participate in activities, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, be a good member. I will study hard, work hard, and labor hard, preparing to contribute all my strength to build the motherland and realize Chairman Mao's great ideals!

Member Slogan

Call:

Be prepared: To strive for the cause of building the motherland and for realizing Chairman Mao's great ideals!

Response:

Always be prepared!

Member Admission Ceremony

The admission ceremony should be solemn and lively, and implement educational significance. Oppose extravagance and waste, and formalistic practices. Every activity of the ceremony and any programs after the meeting are to deepen the impression of joining the team to achieve the purpose of education. The general time should not be too long.

The host of the ceremony is the Communist Youth League's children's committee member.

Before the admission ceremony, each new member must copy the oath on clean paper and sign their name, and bring it to the venue.

The ceremony is generally held by the middle brigade. After organizing the team, the head of the middle brigade reports the number of attendees to the head of the grand brigade or the Communist Youth League's children's committee member. The ceremony then begins.

1. All stand at attention!
2. Present the flag! (Drummers and buglers play music to accompany.)
3. Sing the team song!
4. Announce the list of new members (hosted by the Communist Youth League's children's committee member.)
5. Swear the oath: The Communist Youth League's children's committee member leads the oath reading (raise right hand). After the oath is completed, the new members submit the oath to the Communist Youth League's children's committee member. The flag, drummers, and buglers return to the team.
6. Award the member insignia: In the sound of music, the Communist Youth League's children's committee member, or the head of the grand brigade, or the head of the middle brigade, or the head of the small team and old members preside. Hold the red scarf with both hands and award it to the new members. The new members take it with both hands and place it on their necks, and the awarder ties the knot for the new members. Immediately salute each other and call the team's slogan. The new members join the team.
7. End of ceremony (play music). (Attached image)
