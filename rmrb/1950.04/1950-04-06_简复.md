　　Brief reply to Ma Longbi and Xi Zhijun:
    The work of unifying Chinese translations and specialized terminology is very important in translation. The issue of specialized terminology is currently being studied by relevant departments under the leadership of the Cultural and Educational Committee. Regarding the transliteration of names of people and places, our bureau is currently planning to gather opinions from various relevant parties and draft a preliminary standard transliteration table for reference and use by all sectors, and to solicit opinions. After it is gradually adopted, we will then study and formulate a formal standard transliteration table.

    中文译名及专门名词的统一工作，在翻译上是很重要的一件事。关于专门名词已由文教委员会领导有关部门研究中。关于人地名译音，我局最近拟汇集各有关方面意见，草拟标准译音表草案，供各界参考采用并提供意见，俟逐渐习用以后，再研究订定正式标准译音表。
