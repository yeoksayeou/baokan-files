Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 13th (TASS): The International Democratic Women's Federation has issued an announcement, declaring its participation in the movement to sign the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

The communiqué stated: "The International Democratic Women's Federation believes that it is its responsibility to unconditionally support the appeal to ban atomic weapons. On behalf of the eighty million women united in the International Democratic Women's Federation, we endorse the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and sign it. We urge all of our national women's organizations and every member participating in the International Democratic Women's Federation to sign this appeal and to try to get as many women as possible who are not participating in the International Democratic Women's Federation to sign as well. Because this appeal is against atomic weapons - weapons of aggression - we can and must collect the signatures of millions of women who do not want war and poverty and are determined to defend the right to life of their children."

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 9th (TASS): The Presidium of the Small Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic (note: refers to the highest organ of power during the recess of the Great Khural, i.e., the Supreme People's Assembly), at a recent meeting, passed a declaration expressing full support for the appeal issued by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in February to stop the arms race and ban atomic weapons, as well as the five peace proposals put forward by the Standing Committee in its telegram to the parliaments of all countries last December.
