Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. The Northeast People's Government is focusing on the three major grain-producing provinces of northern Manchuria: Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin, to vigorously promote superior varieties of grain crops. According to preliminary statistics, the above three provinces have already promoted 3,608 tons of soybean varieties such as "Man Cang Jin," 164 tons of Soviet wheat varieties, and 373 tons of rice varieties such as "Mirong" through their own adjustments. The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also lent a total of 214 tons of superior soybean and rice seeds from the superior variety promotion areas in various places to Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces. At the same time, the people's governments of these two provinces selected a total of 3,323 tons of superior seeds suitable for promotion, such as soybeans and wheat, from public grain. With the approval of the Northeast People's Government, these seeds were deemed suitable to replace general grain and were allocated for promotion. All these superior varieties are being promoted with emphasis in the superior variety promotion areas that have been established in various provinces. Heilongjiang has now established nine county-level superior variety promotion areas, and superior seed promotion villages have been set up in nineteen key counties. The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has also directly established eight superior variety promotion areas in the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, and Liaoxi, with a planting area of 109,950 mu. Songjiang Province plans to plant more than 464,400 mu of "Man Cang Jin" soybeans this year. Nehe County, which plants the most soybeans in Heilongjiang, plans to plant 53,000 mu of superior soybean seeds this year. It is estimated that the minimum yield per mu of the superior varieties planted in the superior variety promotion areas this year will increase by 20% for rice, 6% for soybeans, and 8% for wheat compared with the yield of general varieties. If the promotion is continued on the basis of this year's harvest, it is expected that within three years, 80% of the soybean planting area, 35% of the wheat planting area, and 100% of the rice planting area will be planted with superior varieties, and their quality can all meet international trade standards. In addition, all provinces attach great importance to the promotion of superior varieties of miscellaneous grains and special crops such as cotton and hemp. The agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces have also mobilized farmers to conduct seed inspections and disinfection. The Northeast People's Government has allocated more than 160 tons of disinfectant, focusing on distribution to mutual aid groups and superior variety promotion areas. Except for Heilongjiang Province, which is still lacking some, about 50% of the wheat seeds and 20% of the sorghum seeds in other provinces can be disinfected in order to reduce the occurrence of crop diseases.

　　东北人民政府农林部
    大力推广粮食优良品种
    三年内良种播种面积大豆可达百分之八十，小麦百分之三十五，水稻百分之百。                                                            
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北人民政府正以北满产粮区黑龙江、松江、吉林三省为重点，大力推广粮食作物的优良品种。据初步统计：上述三省已用各省自己调剂的方式推广了“满仓金”等大豆品种三千六百零八吨，苏联小麦等品种一百六十四吨，“弥荣”等水稻种三百七十三吨。东北人民政府农林部亦自各地优良品种推广区的优良大豆种与水稻种中贷给松江、黑龙江两省共二百一十四吨，同时，该两省人民政府又在公粮中选出大豆、小麦等适合推广的优良种籽共三千三百二十三吨，经东北人民政府批准，认为可以一般粮食顶替后拨出，用作推广。所有这些优良品种，均在各省已建立的优良品种推广区中实行重点推广。现黑龙江已建立县优良品种推广区九处，并在十九个重点县设有优良种籽推广村。东北人民政府农林部亦直接在黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽东、辽西五省设立八处优良品种推广区，播种面积达十万九千九百五十亩。松江省今年拟种“满仓金”大豆四十六万四千余亩。黑龙江播种大豆最多的讷河县，今年计划播种优良豆种五万三千亩。今年各地优良品种推广区所播种的优良品种，每亩最低产量与一般品种产量比较，估计水稻可增加百分之二十，大豆可增加百分之六，小麦可增加百分之八左右。如在今年收获基础上继续扩大推广，可望在三年内使播种优良品种的大豆播种面积有百分之八十、小麦播种面积有百分之三十五、水稻播种面积有百分之百，其质量亦可全部达到国际贸易之标准。此外，各省对杂粮和棉麻等特产作物的优良品种推广工作亦极重视。各省农林厅还发动农民进行籽种检查和消毒。东北人民政府并拨出消毒药剂一百六十余吨，着重发给互助组和优良品种推广区，除黑龙江省尚缺一部外，其他各省约有百分之五十小麦种和百分之二十高粱种可以消毒，以便减少农作物病害的发生。
