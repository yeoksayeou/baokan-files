Xinhua News Agency, April 24th -- The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issued a directive to its subordinates on the 22nd, strictly prohibiting agencies and military units from engaging in commercial operations. The full text is as follows:

　　Article 6 of the State Council's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" stipulates that all military units and agencies shall not engage in commercial operations. According to reports from various regions, some agencies, military units, and schools are still engaging in commercial operations under the guise of production; some are directly purchasing large quantities of materials on the market without going through local state-owned trading agencies; and some are even engaging in speculative activities in disregard of government decrees. Such behavior often contributes to price fluctuations, making it more difficult for state-owned trading agencies to control market prices. In order to strengthen market management and eliminate undesirable phenomena, the following regulations are hereby reiterated:

　　(1) State-owned trading agencies are the unified leading institutions responsible for regulating supply and demand. No agency, military unit, or school shall engage in commercial operations. Shops established by agencies, military units, and schools in the past should be transferred to state-owned trading agencies, the funds recovered, or closed down on their own. Consumer cooperatives of agencies, military units, and schools can only engage in consumer business within their respective agencies, military units, and schools, and must abide by cooperative regulations.

　　(2) When purchasing and selling materials, mass cooperatives must accept the guidance and supervision of local industrial and commercial administration organs or trade agencies.

　　(3) When agencies, military units, and schools need to purchase large quantities of materials locally or from other places for supply needs, they must go through the local state-owned trading agencies and must not directly or entrust private merchants to purchase on the market.

　　(4) When financial and economic agencies in various regions set up representative agencies for purchasing or selling materials in other regions, they must be approved by the higher-level Financial and Economic Committee (when setting up such agencies between major administrative regions, it is advisable to set up one unified agency), and register locally, and accept the guidance and supervision of the local state-owned trading agency. If no agency is set up and only representatives are sent, they must also register with the local state-owned trading agency and obey its guidance and supervision. These representatives should live in public agencies as much as possible, not in hotels, and not accept private merchant hospitality. The funds they bring must be deposited in the National Bank.

　　(5) For any unit that violates the above regulations, the local government has the right to impose appropriate penalties such as requisition or confiscation, depending on the severity of the circumstances. For cases of major significance, their materials or cash may be frozen and reported to higher authorities for handling.

　　(6) In order to actively prevent the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena and appropriately solve the procurement tasks of various agencies, military units, schools, and cooperatives locally or in other places, state-owned trading agencies in various regions must take the initiative to hold regular meetings, understand the situation, and conduct prepared and planned supply of materials to meet the needs of various units and ensure the procurement of military supplies.

　　After receiving these measures, all regions are requested to immediately notify their subordinates to comply with them and report the implementation situation and your opinions by telegram at any time.

　　中央人民政府财经委员会发布指示
    严禁机关部队经营商业
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于二十二日向所属发布严禁机关部队从事商业经营的指示。全文如下：
    政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”第六条曾规定一切部队机关不得经营商业。迭据各地报告，某些机关、部队、学校，仍有借口生产，从事商业经营者；亦有不经当地国营贸易机关，而直接在市场抢购大宗物资者；更有不顾政府法令，进行投机活动者。此种行为，往往助长物价波动，使国营贸易机关掌握市场物价更感困难。兹为加强市场管理，杜绝不良现象，特再重申下列规定：
    （一）国营贸易机关是负责调节供求的统一的领导机构，任何机关、部队、学校不得从事商业经营。过去机关、部队、学校所设商店，应移交给国营贸易机关，收回资金，或自行结束。机关、部队、学校的消费合作社，只能在各该机关、部队、学校内部经营消费业务，并须遵守合作法规。
    （二）群众的合作社，在收购与抛售物资时，必须接受当地工商管理机关或贸易机关之指导与监督。
    （三）凡机关、部队、学校因供给需要，在本地或外地采购大宗物资时，必须经过当地国营贸易机关，不得直接或委托私商在市场进行收购。
    （四）各地财经机关在外区设立采购或销售物资之代表机关时，必须经上级财委批准（各大行政区之间互设此类机关时，以统一设一个机关为宜），并在当地进行登记，接受当地国营贸易机关之指导与监督。如不设机关，只派代表时，亦须到当地国营贸易机关登记，并服从其指导与监督。这些代表应尽可能住在公家机关，勿住旅馆，勿受私商招待。所带款项，必须存入国家银行。
    （五）对于违犯以上各条规定之任何单位，当地政府均有权视其情节轻重，分别予以征购、没收等应得之处分。其关系重大者，可冻结其物资或现金，报请上级处理。
    （六）为积极防止上述不良现象，并适当解决本地或外地各机关、部队、学校、合作社采购任务，各地国营贸易机关必须主动地负责定期召集会议，了解情况，进行有准备、有计划的供应物资，以满足各单位需要，并保障军需物资的采购。
    各地收到本办法后，希即通知所属遵照施行，并将施行情况及你们意见随时电告。
