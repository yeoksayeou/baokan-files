　　Spring Epidemic Prevention Propaganda Penetrates Suburban Rural Areas
    Seventeen Hundred People Vaccinated On the Spot
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau's Spring Epidemic Prevention Propaganda Week has recently concluded. The targets of this epidemic prevention propaganda were rural areas and some urban laborers that general broadcasting, lectures, and written propaganda cannot currently reach. Propaganda vehicles were dispatched seven times; except for one time within the outer city, the other six times were in suburban areas, with activities reaching Qinglong Bridge, Changxindian, Fengtai, Mentougou, Qinghe Town, Dongba Town, and other places. The propaganda vehicles directly reached approximately over 20,000 listeners. More than 1,700 people were vaccinated against smallpox on the spot, and more than 30 people received diphtheria preventative injections. Along the roads traversed by the propaganda vehicles, many merchants and residents set up tea stands in front of their doors to express their welcome, saying, "The current government is truly different. Smallpox vaccinations are brought right to our doorstep!" In many places, the masses surrounded the propaganda vehicles, eagerly vying to get vaccinated against smallpox.
