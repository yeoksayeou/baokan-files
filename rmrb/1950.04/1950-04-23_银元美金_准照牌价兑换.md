　　Silver Dollar and US Dollar
　　Exchange at Official Rate

　　Zhou Qiangjun:
　　Regarding your suggestion that the government collect US dollars, the People's Bank of China has responded as follows:
　　To prevent the people from suffering losses, the government still allows people to exchange US dollar cash held by the public for Renminbi at the prescribed cash exchange rate at branches of the Bank of China across the country.

　　Editor Wei Hejun:
　　If you want to exchange your stored silver dollars for People's Bank Notes, please contact the business department of the Bank of China at No. 1 Xijiaomin Lane.

    准照牌价兑换周强君：
    你建议政府收兑美金一事，现经中国人民银行答复如下：
    为避免人民遭受损失起见，现在政府对于民间留存的美金现钞，仍准持向各地中国银行按规定之现钞牌价兑换人民币。          编者魏鹤君：
    你要把所存银元兑换人民券，请到西交民巷一号中国银行营业部接洽。
