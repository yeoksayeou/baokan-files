　　[Our Newspaper, Shuyang, 29th Dispatch] Reporter Yong Jin reports: The large-scale spring Yi River diversion project officially commenced in early March. 300,000 workers from ten counties, including Shuyang, Xin'an, Siyang, Suining, Guanyun, Huaiyin, Suqian, and Lianshui, are engaged in intense and enthusiastic labor along the 400-li Yi River line. The people of the Huaihai region, who supported the Huaihai Campaign and achieved a brilliant victory more than a year ago, are creating new achievements: eliminating the flooding that has plagued millions of mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu for decades.

　　Communist Party members and Youth League members are courageously taking the lead, working tirelessly with the broad masses from dawn to dusk. Many women are also participating in this spring repair work. In Xin'an County alone, more than 1,100 women have gone to the dyke. Duan Cuilan, an 18-year-old Youth League member from the Shizi District of Xin'an County, is responsible for preparing meals for twelve people, and can still carry eighty baskets of earth every day. Many labor heroes have emerged. The famous Wang Daqiao can do the work of two or three people alone. The members of Li Shigong's youth team can each complete up to eleven cubic meters of earthwork per day.

　　The Yi River diversion project adopts the method of using work as relief, which can help 800,000 disaster victims in northern Jiangsu to survive the famine. On the river embankment, the faces of many disaster victims are already rosy. This spring, the Yi River diversion project totals 27 million cubic meters of earthwork. With the hard work of 300,000 workers, 22 percent has already been completed. Guanyun County has completed an average of 35 percent, and Shuyang County has completed 43.5 percent. Some teams have completed more than seventy days of tasks in just ten days. Recently, there have been continuous spring rains, but the vast majority of workers are still working hard in the rain. After the completion of the first phase of the New Yi River project this year, more than five million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu will be freed from flooding, and it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 500 million jin.

　　淮海三十万民工活跃沂河线上
    进行春季导沂工程
    以工代赈八十万灾民可渡过春荒
    五百万亩田地数十年水患将可从此免除
    【本报沭阳二十九日电】记者勇进报道：规模巨大的春季导沂工程，已于三月上旬动工。沭阳、新安、泗阳、睢宁、灌云、淮阴、宿迁、涟水等十县三十万民工，正在四百华里的沂河线上，从事紧张热情的劳动。一年多以前支援淮海战役取得辉煌胜利的淮海区人民，正在创造新的业绩：消灭数十年来危害苏北数百万亩田地的水患。
    共产党员、青年团员奋勇当先，和广大群众一起，从黎明至夜晚，不倦地工作着。很多妇女也参加了这春修工作。仅新安县即有一千一百余名妇女上堤。新安县十字区十八岁的女青年团员段萃兰，一人负责作十二个人的饭，每天还能抬八十筐土。许多劳动英雄已涌现出来。有名的王大锹，一人能顶两个人到三个人劳动。李士功青年小组的组员，每人每天最高能修十一公方土。
    导沂工程采取以工代赈的方式，这可以帮助苏北八十万灾民渡过灾荒。在河堤上，很多灾民的面孔已显红润。今春导沂工程共二千七百万公方土，在三十万民工艰苦努力之下，已完成了百分之二十二，灌云县平均完成百分之三十五，沭阳县已完成百分之四十三点五，有些小组已在十数天内完成了七十多天的任务。近日春雨连绵，绝大多数民工仍冒雨坚持工作。今年新沂河第一阶段工程完工后，苏北将有五百余万亩田地免除水患，估计可增产粮食五亿斤。
