　　The Youth Service Department in Early Spring
　　Helu

　　"Comrade, can I get a ticket for the 'Weekly Literary Lecture'?"
　　"Comrade, I want to join the political class."
　　"Comrade, when is the basketball game?"
　　"Comrade,..."
　　When I occasionally stand at the entrance, I often encounter young friends asking such questions. But more people don't ask, and often walk past me with great interest or a relaxed expression, heading into the gate. It can be seen that they are very fond of and familiar with the Youth Service Department.

　　The hall, the "indoor square" of the Youth Service Department, is important not only because it has various newspapers and games, but also because there is a question-and-answer desk representing the department's formal reception of the masses. It answers people's questions and guides them to seek the activities they need. Thus, through this point, people radiate in all directions like light.

　　People appear in the library, looking for "Study," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "New Sons and Daughters," "Xinhua Monthly," "China Youth"... People appear in political classes, Russian classes, bookkeeping classes, art classes, harmonica classes, tea rooms, and even the office. People appear in every corner, in groups of three or five, a dozen, or dozens, discussing issues, talking about life, and playing collective games. These scenes are quite touching.

　　　　A Few Reading Reflections

　　Liu Dequan, a student at Beijing Municipal No. 2 Middle School, rarely read new novels before. After reading "How the Steel Was Tempered" recently, he wrote: "Paul said: 'I dedicate my entire life and power to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the liberation of all mankind.' This sentence moved me greatly, and I have deeply engraved it in my mind... He truly deserves to be called an excellent Communist Party member, and his great spirit is truly worthy of our learning." Zhang Shiliang, after reading "Youth Cultivation," examined himself and said: "Inconsistent words and deeds are my biggest shortcomings... After reading the section on 'the unity of theory and practice' in this book, I realized that nothing can be accomplished by just talking without doing." Zhu Wei, after reading "Female Communist Party Member," said: "From this, it can be seen that the Communist Party has the spirit of sacrificing oneself to serve the masses."

　　　　"A Crow Turns into a Phoenix"

　　Zhang Zhenchang, a small market merchant, comes to the service department to read and attend classes whenever he can spare the time. He says he can learn and progress in the service department. A dozen or so young friends who used to be not very upright often argued and made a scene when they first came to the service department. After the cadres' patient talks and enlightenment, they have now made significant changes. Guan Junxing not only joined the voluntary work group, but also arrives on time and has a good attitude towards people, making him a good member. Everyone says, "A crow has turned into a phoenix." Ma Yiwen is determined to apply to the Revolutionary University, wanting to move from being a "loafer" to a revolutionary. Their common expression can be represented by Cui Tianci's words: "Now I know how to do serious things."

　　　　I Want to Compete With Them

　　"I am forty-seven years old this year. My name is Ma Siming. Both of my daughters have entered university, are members of the Youth League, and are also members of the service department. They introduced me to study here. Comrade, do you think I can still make progress?" A housewife said this to us not long ago, and now she has joined the political class. Similarly, another housewife said to us: "Comrade, I really can't stand my children anymore. They scold me for being backward and my thinking not 'New Democratic.' Now I ask you to help me make progress, what's the fastest way? I want to compete with them."

　　　　"The Spring of Youth"

　　In the past three months, the service department's reading room has had over 26,000 readers, the political class has had about 120 students, and the lecture audiences have numbered over 2,500. Two hundred and nine basketball games have been held, with audiences reaching over 50,000. More than 70,000 people have participated in activities in the games room and ice rink. Of all these figures, youth account for 99.6%, fully achieving: a activity area for youth themselves.

　　Spring has arrived, and the pond in the front yard of the service department is rippling with clear waves, and the tree branches are as green and moist as the laughter of the turned-over workers and peasants. Enthusiastic masses, who previously helped us sweep snow, are now helping us to arrange the flowerbeds. They are concerned about the service department's expanding vocational training classes and the basketball court that will be added, and they are also concerned about every small detail of the excursions and evening parties. When the sun shines on the service department and is reflected on the water surface, they praise each other and say: "The Youth Service Department is so beautiful!" "The Youth Service Department is the spring of youth."

　　初春时节的青年服务部
    赫鲁
    “同志，我可以领星期文艺讲座票吗？”
    “同志，我想参加政治班。”
    “同志，几时篮球比赛？”
    “同志，………”
    当我偶尔站在门口的时候，常遇到一些青年朋友们发出这样的问题。但更多的人却并不问，就往往兴致勃勃或神色怡然地从身旁走过去，走到大门里去。可以看出来，他们对于青年服务部是非常亲切和熟悉的。
    大厅，这青年服务部的“室内广场”，它的重要不仅是因为有各种报纸和游艺玩具，而是因为有一个问答台代表服务部正式接待群众。它解答人们的问题，同时指引人们去寻求自己需要的活动。于是，通过这一点，人们像光线一样向四方幅射。
    人们出现在图书阅览室，找《学习》、《毛泽东选集》、《新儿女英雄传》、《新华月报》、《中国青年》……。人们出现在政治班、俄文班、簿记班、美术班、口琴班、茶厅乃至办公室。人们出现在每个角落里，三五人、十几人、几十人，讨论问题，座谈生活，集体游戏。这些景象是很够动人的。
            几篇读书心得
    北京市市立二中刘德权同学，以前很少看过新小说。最近看了《钢铁是怎样炼成的》以后，写下这样的话：“保尔说：我把整个的生命与权力都献给世界上最壮丽的事业——为全人类解放而斗争。这一句话使我受了很大的感动，我已经把它深刻在我的脑中。……他真称得起是个优秀的共产党员，他有这样伟大的精神，真值得我们来学习。”张世梁看了《青年修养》以后检讨自己说：“言行不一，这是我的顶大缺点……我看了这本书里面‘理论和实践的统一’的一节，知道了光说不做是什么事也办不成的。”朱纬读完了《女共产党员》说：“由此可见，共产党有牺牲自己服务群众的精神。”
            “老鸹变了凤凰”
    市场小商人张镇昌只要能抽身就来服务部阅览、听课，他说在服务部能学习、进步。有十几个从前不很务正的青年朋友，刚来服务部的时候常吵架起哄，经过干部耐心的谈话和启发，现在有显著的改变。关俊兴不但参加了义务工作组，而且准时到，对人态度好，是一个好的组员了。大家都说：“老鸹变了凤凰。”马益文决心投考革命大学，要从“油子”走向革命。他们的共同表现，可以用崔天赐的一句话代表：“现在我知道干正经事儿了。”
            我要和他们比一比
    “我今年四十七岁了。我叫马思明。两个女儿进了大学，都是团员，也都是部友。她们介绍我来学习。同志，你们看我还能进步吗？”一个家庭妇女不久之前这样向我们说，现在她参加了政治班。同样，另一个家庭妇女对我们说：“同志，我实在不能受儿女们的气了。他们骂我落后，思想不‘新民主主义’。现在求你们帮助我进步，用个什么法儿快一点，我要和他们比一比。”
            “青年的春天”
    三个月来，服务部阅览室的读者达二万六千余人，政治班的学员是一百二十人左右，讲座听众是二千五百余人。举行篮球赛二百零九场，观众达五万人以上。参加游艺室与冰场活动的共达七万余人。所有这些数字中间，青年占百分之九九·六，充分地做到了：青年自己的活动园地。
    春天来了，服务部前院的水池微漾着清波，树枝青润得像翻了身的工人、农民的欢笑。热心的群众，从前帮助我们扫雪，现在又帮助我们整理花圃。他们关心服务部正在扩大的职业补习班和将要增辟的篮球场，他们也关心郊游和晚会的每一个细小节目。当太阳照耀着服务部而倒影在水面呈现的时候，他们争相赞赏说：“青年服务部多好看啊！”“青年服务部是青年的春天。”
