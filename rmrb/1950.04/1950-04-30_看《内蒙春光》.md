　　Watching "Spring in Inner Mongolia"

　　“The sky is vast, the fields are boundless, the wind blows the grass low and reveals cattle and sheep.” We collectively call the people who live there “Mongolians;” as if they are all the same, merely children of nature. "Spring in Inner Mongolia" tells us that within the Mongolian people, there are indeed herdsmen who spend their days with cattle, horses, camels, and sheep, and those princes and other parasitic classes who live off the herdsmen, enjoying song, dance, lamb, and fine wine. The liberation of minority nationalities requires not only escaping oppression from other foreign and major domestic nationalities, but also escaping oppression and enslavement from within their own nationality, to achieve true liberation. The film depicts the awakening process of a young herdsman named Dendebe, mainly focusing on this point.

　　The film portrays the character of Dendebe deeply and completely. The intense struggle within him feels so real. It turns out he is in love with Uyunbileg, the sister of Menghebaerte. One day, as he rushes home from a construction site to visit his mother, he sees Uyunbileg on the road, and the two are deeply in love when suddenly her brother's return causes them to become estranged. Because Dendebe suspects that the stranger who returned with her brother is a Han Chinese, and is talking about some "Autonomous Movement Federation," he vehemently opposes it. Although Menghebaerte explains to him, his own logic is that every Han Chinese who comes says it's for the good of the Mongolians, but in the end, the Mongolians always suffer. Therefore, he even shows estrangement and indifference to his old friend Menghebaerte, whom he hasn't seen for years. But one stormy night, before he can rush home, the stranger helps his family cover the roof that has been blown off by the wind, and rescues his mother from the mud. The young man is naturally moved from the bottom of his heart, but due to his stubborn views and his fundamental inability to understand that there are people in the world called "Communists" who can help their class brothers unconditionally, he still casts a suspicious eye on the stranger. Later, he is dispatched by the prince to follow others to the Chiang-occupied area (only two days away from the banner), where he sees officials leisurely enjoying themselves with their concubines, secret agents and lackeys causing trouble for him, and Americans in jeeps rushing towards him, with the driver getting out to beat him up; while kind Han Chinese people help him up from the ground and return his lost horses to him. On the way back, he also encounters Uyunbileg being humiliated by that Mr. Yang (a Kuomintang-sent secret agent). This cannot help but leave him with several question marks – people of the same nationality and different nationalities also have a common character, common feelings, and common interests; one is a complete hatred and incompatibility, while the other is a subtle harmony and congruence. Later, when the prince asks him to assassinate Comrade Su He, Dendebe picks up the dagger, filled with mixed feelings along the way, everything that can distinguish between false good and bad based solely on justice and instinct emerges in his mind. He then explains his intentions and admits his mistake to Comrade Su He. Finally, he voluntarily follows Comrade Su He to the liberated area to request the People's Liberation Army to help liberate his hometown. In battle, he fights alongside Han Chinese, and finally captures the Kuomintang secret agent. After the liberation of his hometown, he marries Uyunbileg, and later, encouraged by his mother and wife, joins the People's Liberation Army's Mongolian-Han joint army. Before leaving, his mother instructs him: "Go, when you see Chairman Mao, when you see Ulanhu, tell them: even an old woman who is almost blind on the grassland sees the benefits they have brought!" Dendebe mounts his warhorse, filled with joy, marching at the front of the Mongolian cavalry, fighting to forever defend his grassland and forever defend the common interests of all nationalities.

　　What a lovable character this is! This kind of character is growing rapidly among all nationalities across the country, and therefore this film has a significant impact on promoting further close unity among all nationalities in the country. The actor Enhe Sen, who plays this role, is himself a Mongolian. It is said that he not only has no previous screen experience, but also has never even seen a movie before. Yet he is able to perform so excellently, so successfully! This naturally relies on his life and talent on the one hand; but on the other hand, we can also see that Mongolian young artists are truly showing infinite loyalty and enthusiasm in being loyal to the liberation of their own nationality and promoting the liberation and unity of all nationalities in the country, otherwise, there could not have been such a huge collaboration and such a moving performance as "Spring in Inner Mongolia."

　　In terms of performance, one thing that is particularly impressive is that when Dendebe is chasing the Kuomintang secret agent and discovers that his rifle bullets are used up, he immediately grabs the nearby lasso pole and rushes forward, dragging that "Mr. Yang" off his horse. This not only demonstrates the bravery of the Mongolian people, but also the wisdom of the Mongolian people, so it has made a deep impression on the audience.

　　However, because the film overemphasizes the portrayal of this character, it also produces another shortcoming, that is, it makes Dendebe's character appear relatively isolated; as if the other masses are already very progressive, and only he has committed serious narrow nationalism! In this way, the film cannot help but borrow some coincidental events to make him move towards the final transformation. This ingenious arrangement has its advantages, that is, the impression that Dendebe gives the audience is prominent; but it should also be seen that it has its disadvantages, that is, it is easy to make people feel that Dendebe is destined to resist, thus reducing the audience's ability to rationally understand the general abuse and humiliation suffered by the people of Inner Mongolia, and that under the influence of the Communist Party's correct ethnic policy, they will inevitably break through the prejudice of narrow nationalism and move towards resisting the rulers of their own nation. Because in order to highlight Dendebe's character, his prejudice against the Han Chinese has been overemphasized. The facts witnessed and personally experienced time and time again cannot make him resolutely change his doubts, until he is forced to carry out the task of assassinating Su He, and only when he reaches the door of Su He's residence does he fall to the ground, recalling the past twelve times in a row, before he makes the final decision!

　　Dendebe should not be such a weak person – holding a dagger, pacing on the grassland, hesitating; later, when he explains his intentions to Comrade Su He, he lowers his head and wipes his tears with his sleeve. This kind of treatment is not very coordinated with the bold character of the Mongolian people, and with Dendebe's own background. This is a slight imperfection in the film.

　　Regarding the Party's ethnic policy, this film handles it very well. It is not empty preaching, but vividly embodies it through the development of several specific events, through the actions of a specific character, Su He. When Su He arrives at Daerjia Banner, he clearly expresses the purpose of the "Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Movement Federation" to the prince, and makes it clear that as long as the prince does not oppose the people of Inner Mongolia, he is welcome. But when he and the prince come out of the banner government office, they happen to see Menghebaerte's father falling from the mountain and suffering a bloody head injury while repairing a project for the prince. Su He immediately suggests to the prince that the slavery system should be abolished. In this way, the prince is forced to order the disbandment of those who were repairing the project for him. When those who support the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Movement automatically gather at Menghebaerte's house to listen to Comrade Su He's speech, Su He uses the story of Inner Mongolia's own hero – Kadamuren – to encourage the people of Inner Mongolia to bravely stand up and fight. The film also expresses the respect and remembrance of the masses for Kadamuren, singing songs to commemorate this national hero, which makes the presentation much more lively; also, at the Aobao meeting, Su He sees that Mr. Yang who is disguised as a monk from Qinghai. Yang deliberately says to Su He: "The liberated areas advocate religious freedom..." and Su He replies sternly: "But if someone uses the name of religion to carry out political activities, that is another matter." Later, when the prince and the Living Buddha race horses, and the prince's horse loses, the young rider – Dendebe's younger brother – is whipped on the spot. But Su He also stops this tyrannical behavior on the spot and promotes the principle that the people of Inner Mongolia must unite to seek liberation to the attendees. On these important issues, "Spring in Inner Mongolia" focuses on the leadership of the Party, and expresses it very deeply and naturally, closely linking the theme and specific characters and events, without being dry or contrived.

　　The film is full of Mongolian flavor. In the beginning, Dendebe is chasing horses on the grassland; Uyunbileg is barefoot on the grassland herding sheep; when she and Dendebe become engaged, she takes out an embroidered tobacco pouch; the milky tea served to guests, as well as the performances at the Aobao meeting, etc., all have a strong Inner Mongolian flavor. However, "Spring in Inner Mongolia" is fundamentally different from those colonialist films that have a curiosity about ethnic minorities. It is very measured, starting from the need to express the theme. Although it also depicts the interweaving of love, it is arranged very appropriately, and does not render "love between men and women." The whole thing looks very natural and serious.

　　So I think "Spring in Inner Mongolia" is a successful work. Whether in terms of the positivity of the theme or the techniques of artistic expression, it has made us take a step forward on the basis of the past. This film allows us to see the real life and struggles of the people of Inner Mongolia. We hope that there will be another film depicting the construction of Inner Mongolia and films depicting other ethnic minorities, so as to strengthen the propaganda of the ethnic policies of the People's Republic of China and promote closer brotherly mutual assistance and unity among all ethnic groups in the country.

　　看《内蒙春光》
    “天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊。”生活在那里的人，我们统称他做“蒙人”；好像他们都是一样，都只不过是大自然的儿女。《内蒙春光》却告诉我们，在蒙古民族之中，原来也有着朝夕与牛、马、骆驼、羊为伍的牧民，和那些依靠着牧民而过着轻歌曼舞与羊羔美酒生活的王公以及其他寄生阶级，少数民族的解放，固然首先要挣脱其他异民族和国内大民族的压迫；同时也要挣脱自己民族内部的压迫和奴役，才能有真正的解放。影片中描写了一个青年牧民顿得布的觉悟过程，主要的便是在这样一点上。
    这影片把顿得布这个人物的性格刻划得深刻、完整。在他内心所引起的强烈的斗争，令人觉得是那样逼真。原来，他爱上了孟赫巴尔特的妹妹乌云碧勒格。这天，当他从修工地方赶回家来探望他的母亲，在路上看见乌云碧勒格，两人正爱意情浓的时候，突然由于她哥哥的回来，而使他们疏远起来。由于顿得布疑心那个跟她哥哥回来的陌生人是个汉人，而且还说要闹什么“自治运动联合会”，这便遭致了他强烈的反抗。虽然孟赫巴尔特向他解释，而他自己的逻辑则是：那一个汉人来，都说是为了蒙古人的好处，而到头都总是蒙古人吃了大亏。所以，他竟对多年不见的老朋友孟赫巴尔特，也表示疏远和冷淡。但当一个暴风雨的晚上，他还来不及赶回家去的时候，那个陌生人却为他家把被风吹掉的顶篷盖了起来，并从泥泞中救起了他的母亲。这个年轻人自然从内心中受到一些感动，但由于他固执的见解和根本不能够理解世界上还有一种叫做“共产主义者”的人，是可以毫无条件地帮助自己的阶级兄弟的，而仍对这陌生人投以怀疑的眼光。后来，他被王爷派遣跟随别人到了蒋占区（离该旗只有两天路程），在那里，他看见当官的挟带着姨太太逍遥自在，特务狗腿找他惹事生非，坐在吉普上的美国人向他迎面冲撞而来，司机却下来把他打了一顿；而善良的汉族人民却把他从地上扶起来，把丢失了的马匹牵来交还给他。在回来的路上又适遇乌云碧勒格遭受着那位杨先生（国民党派来的特务）的侮辱。这样，便使他不能不留下若干疑问号—同民族和不同民族的人，原来也有着一种共同的性格、共同的心情和共同的利益；一种是那样绝然的仇视和格格不入，而另一种则是那样微妙的相投与契合。后来当王爷要他刺杀苏合同志的时候，顿得布拾起匕首，一路上万感交集，一切单只凭着正义和本能便可以识别伪好的和坏的事情，一一在他脑里浮现出来。他于是在苏合同志面前说明了自己的来意并承认了错误。最后，并自愿跟着苏合同志到解放区请求人民解放军来帮助解放自己的家乡。在战斗里，他和汉人并肩作战，最后并生擒了国民党特务。家乡解放之后，他和乌云碧勒格结了婚，后来并在他母亲和妻子的鼓励之下参加了人民解放军蒙汉联军。母亲在临行时嘱咐他道：“你去吧，见到毛主席，见到乌兰夫，你告诉他：在草地上一个快瞎了眼的老太婆，也看到他给的好处了！”顿得布跨上战马，充满了愉快的心情，行进在蒙古铁骑兵行列的前面，为永远保卫自己的草原，永远保卫着各民族共同的利益而战斗了。
    这是一种多么可爱的性格呵！这种性格正在全国各民族中迅速成长，因而这影片对于促成全国各民族进一步亲密团结具有重大影响。饰这个角色的演员恩和森同志自己便是一个蒙民，听说他不但从来没有过银幕经验，而且过去是连电影也没看过的。而他竟能够表演得如此出色，如此成功！这自然一方面要依靠他的生活和天赋；但是另一方面，我们也可以看到，蒙古的青年艺术家，他们在忠于自己民族的解放和促成全国各民族的解放与团结上，实在是表现了无限的忠心和热忱，不然，便不可能有像《内蒙春光》这样巨大的合作和如此动人的表演。
    在表演上，有一点特别给人以深刻印象的，是在顿得布追击国民党特务发现步枪子弹打完了时，立刻又抓起旁边套马的白蜡杆子飞奔上前，将那位“杨先生”拖下马来。这样，便不仅表现蒙古人民的英勇，而且表现了蒙古人民的智慧，所以它在观众中获得了极深的印象。
    但是，影片中由于过分的着重了这个人物的刻划，也产生了另外一个缺点，即把顿得布的性格显得比较孤立了一些；好像其他的群众都已经很进步了，唯独他一个人犯了严重的狭隘民族主义！这样，影片中便不能不借若干带有偶然性的巧合的事情来使他走向最后的转变了。这种奇巧的安排固有所得，即顿得布所给予观众的印象是突出的；但亦应看出它有所失的地方，即容易使人觉得顿得布是命中注定了要反抗的，因而也就减轻了观众去合理的认识内蒙人民所受到的一般的虐待和凌辱，在共产党的正确民族政策的感召之下，他们必然会突破狭隘民族主义的偏见走向反抗本民族统治者的道路。因为要突出表现顿得布这个人物，以致把他对汉人的成见作了过份的强调。一次接着一次所目睹身受的事实，都不能使他毅然改变自己的怀疑，一直他被迫去执行刺杀苏合的任务，到了苏合驻地的门口，才跌倒在地下，一连把十二次的往事回忆起来，才下定了最后的决心！
    顿得布不应该是这样软弱的人——手执着匕首，彳亍在草地上，犹疑不决；后来当他向苏合同志说明来意以后，又低下头去用衣袖擦着眼泪，这样处理，便和蒙古人民豪放的性格，和顿得布自己的出身，显得不很协调了。这是影片中一点美中不足的地方。
    关于党的民族政策，这影片确是处理得很出色。它不是空洞的说教，而是通过了若干具体事件的发展，通过了苏合这样一个具体人物的行动，生动的体现出来了。苏合到了道尔基亚王旗，明确的对王爷表示了“内蒙人民自治运动联合会”的宗旨，并且表明了只要王爷不反对内蒙人民，也是欢迎的。但当他与王爷从旗公署出来，正碰见孟赫巴尔特的父亲为王爷修工从山上摔下来，跌得头破血流。苏合于是立刻向王爷建议，应该废除奴役制度。这样，才逼得王爷不得不下令解散了那些为他修工的人。当那些拥护内蒙人民自治的运动的人，自动的集合在孟赫巴尔特家里，听苏合同志讲话的时候，苏合却用内蒙民族自己的英雄——卡达梅仁的故事，来激励内蒙人民应该勇敢起来斗争。电影上并通过群众对卡达梅仁的崇敬和怀念，唱起纪念这位民族英雄的歌曲，表现形式上就觉得生动活泼多了；还有，在敖包会上，苏合见到那个化装着从青海来念经的杨先生。杨故意对苏合说：“解放区主张宗教自由……”而苏合正色回答说：“可是如果要有人借着宗教的名义来进行政治活动，那就不一样了。”后来，当王爷和活佛赛马，王爷的马赛输了，于是那个年轻的骑手——顿得布的弟弟当场遭到鞭笞。但是苏合也当场止住了这种暴虐的行为并向赴会的人宣传内蒙人民必须团结起来求得解放的道理。在这样一些重要的问题上，《内蒙春光》着重的表现了党的领导，而且表现得很深刻、很自然，把主题思想和具体人物事件紧密联系起来，而不干瘪，不造作。
    影片充满了蒙古情调。一开始，顿得布便在草原上追逐着马匹；乌云碧勒格赤着脚在草地上赶着羊群；当她和顿得布定情的时候，掏出了绣着花的烟荷包；请客时喝的奶子茶以及像敖包会上的表演等等，都有着浓郁的内蒙风味。但是《内蒙春光》却根本区别于那种对少数民族带着猎奇欲的殖民地主义的电影。它是很有分寸的，从表现主题的需要出发的。其中虽然也描写了爱情的穿插，但却安排得很得体，而并没有渲染“儿女情长”，整个的看起来很自然，很严肃。
    所以我觉得《内蒙春光》是一个成功的作品，无论主题的积极性上，艺术表现的手法上，都使我们从过去的基础上跃进了一步。这部影片，使我们看到了内蒙人民的真实生活与斗争，我们希望再有一部描写内蒙建设的影片及描写其他少数民族的影片，这样来加强中华人民共和国的民族政策的宣传，与促进国内各民族的更亲密的兄弟般的互助团结。
