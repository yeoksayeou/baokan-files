　　Postal Briefs
    [Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Postal Administration: In order to facilitate the public's mailing of small parcel mail, the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has recently issued an order to postal offices in various locations to universally handle small parcel mail services. Each small parcel is limited to a weight of five kilograms. Both rural and urban areas with post offices or postal agencies can accept and send them. Furthermore, the transit is particularly rapid. Parcels not exceeding five kilograms in weight, if the sender or recipient pays the full delivery fee (the delivery fee for parcels weighing one kilogram or less is charged at the rate of two domestic ordinary letters; for parcels weighing more than one kilogram but less than five kilograms, it is charged at the rate of four ordinary letters), can be directly delivered to the recipient by postal delivery personnel.
