　　Beijing Sentences Local Tyrants
    Two Given Prison Terms, Two Sentenced to Death
    Special Agent and Habitual Bandit Wu Yunguang Sentenced to Life Imprisonment
    [Our Newspaper News] According to news from the Beijing News Office: Yang Jinfang, a local tyrant landlord from the 14th district of Beijing's suburbs, and Ma Shijun, a local tyrant landlord from the 15th district, have been accused by the masses, arrested, and interrogated. The trials have now concluded. The Municipal People's Court has announced its verdicts: the two criminals are sentenced to life imprisonment and fifteen years in prison respectively; Yang Jinfang's embezzled funds are confiscated and turned over to the public.
    The local tyrant Yang Jinfang lived in Majiabao Village, 14th district, southern suburbs of Beijing. In 1946, he served as the puppet Bao chief, commander of the local militia, and secretary of the 15th District Branch of the Kuomintang, consistently persecuting and exploiting peasants. Those who died directly or indirectly at his hands include: Wang Long, who died after a forced abortion due to his rape, and Feng Guiqing, who fell to his death after being forced to dismantle a watchtower while ill. In addition, he forcibly occupied the land and carts of Wang Zihou and Cao Wenlin, and arrested and beat Zhang Yongcheng, Hu Fengshan, Zhu Fengli, Wang Fengjin, and others. During his time in puppet positions, he embezzled public funds equivalent to 47,185 and a half catties of corn. Ma Shijun, also known as Ma Liezi, lived in Guogongzhuang, 15th district of Beijing's suburbs. He successively served as puppet Bao chief, village chief, branch president of the Japanese New People's Society, and director of the 11th District Joint Security of the southern suburbs. He colluded with Japanese spies to arrest villagers Zhang Shoutian and Zhang Chunlin, transferring them to the Japanese Kempeitai (military police) where they were secretly killed; as a result, our anti-Japanese worker Zhang Zhiyi was also arrested and tortured to death. He also ordered the shooting death of Li Zhao, and beat Jin Huer to death; furthermore, he successively seduced and occupied Niu Wenyu's wife, Ma Xiurong, raped the fifteen-year-old Lu Daxian, and beat women Chen Zhao and Qi Gong, and arrested villagers Liu Zhiting, Zhang Baozhen, and others.
    [Our Newspaper News] According to news from the Beijing News Office: Special agent and habitual bandit Wu Yunguang, who repeatedly formed gangs to rob at gunpoint, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Control Commission's Military Court of Beijing. Accomplice Hu Chenglin was sentenced to five years in prison, Zhang Defu was sentenced to three years in prison, and Wu Dai was sentenced to two years in prison. The recovered stolen goods, including gold ingots and gold rings, were returned to their original owners. Since 1947, Wu Yunguang had successively served as deputy captain of the puppet militia in Jixian County, Hebei, and liaison officer (special agent) of the Second Division of the puppet North China剿匪 Headquarters (bandit suppression). He had injured two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and arrested our workers Wang Guangxin and others. After the liberation of Beijing, the criminal did not register as ordered by the Military Control Commission. After being reported by Wang Guangxin and others, he was arrested, but took the opportunity to escape, colluding with bandits Hu Chenglin, Zhang Defu, and others. From May to August of last year, they carried out robberies in six locations, and beat the victims and their families with clubs and iron bars.
    [News from the Beijing News Office] The Military Control Commission's Military Court of this city publicly tried the traitorous bandits and local tyrants Zhang Wenhuan and Zhang Deyu in Zhangguozhuang, Changxindian yesterday (3rd) morning, sentenced the two criminals to death in court, and executed them by shooting on the spot. Zhang Wenhuan was from Wanping County, a member of the Kuomintang, and had served as the puppet Bao chief, township chief, and director of the Military-Civilian Cooperation Station of Zhangguozhuang. In 1945, he instigated puppet soldiers to arrest our revolutionary cadres Chen Guangxi, An Shaowu, Shi Zhengben, Guo Jingcheng, and others, six people in total. Shi Zhengben and Chen Guangshan were shot and killed, and Guo Jingcheng was starved to death. The criminal Zhang also personally led the puppet militia to build strongholds for the enemy, conscript soldiers and grain, and beat more than ten peasants including Wang Yongshun. During his tenure as puppet township chief, he embezzled more than 10,000 catties of corn. Zhang Deyu was from Beijing, and had successively served as deputy captain of the puppet police force, township captain, and company commander of the security regiment. In 1944, when Zhang Deyu was stationed in Dongzhaidang, Wanping, he accompanied the Japanese army to Wangjiashan, setting fire to the area and burning to death forty to fifty people, and robbing peasants of cattle, sheep, and property. In 1946, he killed our Zhangguozhuang security officer Pang Huijun and farmers' association director Pang Huizhen, and assisted the traitorous bandit and local tyrant Zhang Wenhuan in shooting and killing our revolutionary cadres Shi Zhengben and Chen Guangshan. In addition, he frequently beat the people and extorted property. After the liberation of Beijing, the local masses reported the crimes, and the Public Security Bureau arrested the two criminals and transferred them to the Military Control Commission's Military Court for trial. Yesterday, when the Military Control Commission announced the death sentences of the two criminals, it immediately received enthusiastic support from the masses. Zhang Cui, the victim's wife, said: "With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I dare to speak now. You running dogs can no longer use guns to bully me today." Another victim said: "He killed my father. Today the government has avenged us. From now on, I will work hard and produce well."
