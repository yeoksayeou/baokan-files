　　French Workers' Strike Movement
    The Struggle for Peace Coupled with the Struggle for Bread Forces the Reactionary Rulers' Intimidation to be Ineffective
    Pravda Zhukov reports
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th, TASS dispatch:] Pravda's Paris correspondent Zhukov reported that the French laboring masses' continuous struggle for peace and bread states: The French workers' strike has been going on for two months. The wave of strikes has not yet subsided in one industrial sector, and has risen again in other sectors, with a total of more than one million working people participating in the strike.

    The French rulers hastily tried to pass laws in parliament in an attempt to severely punish peace fighters, believing that this would create the necessary conditions for expanding war production and smoothly receiving American military supplies. However, after the implementation of the law, several incidents have occurred in French ports in which dockworkers resolutely refused to load war materials destined for Vietnam, and resolutely refused to unload military equipment transported from foreign countries.

    The struggle between democratic forces and reactionary forces is becoming increasingly fierce. Not long ago, when the mass strike began, many workers said that all they wanted was to improve their material conditions and "not be involved in politics." But at present, among the French working class, there are more and more people who understand that the struggle for bread is inseparable from the struggle for peace and the struggle for freedom. Some of the things that happened in the strike of electricity and gas workers further helped the masses of people eliminate illusions about bourgeois democracy. The government sent troops to power stations and gas plants to force workers to resume work, but the workers refused to yield, and were thus subjected to mass arrests and court trials.

    The broadest strata of the people support the strikers. When the gas factory workers were on trial, tens of thousands of demonstrators insisted on the immediate release of the defendants. Under mass pressure, the court released the strikers in batches, and many of the released workers immediately applied to join the Communist Party. The workers announced the cessation of the strike after the management made concessions and increased wages, and declared that they would continue the struggle.

    Neither slanderous propaganda, police terror, nor the intimidation of newly-devised "heinous" laws can stop the growth and strengthening of the powerful movement of peace fighters.

### 法国工人的罢工运动  争和平结合着争面包的斗争迫使反动统治者的威吓无效

　　法国工人的罢工运动
    争和平结合着争面包的斗争迫使反动统治者的威吓无效
    真理报朱可夫报道
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道法国劳动大众争取和平与面包的不停斗争称：法国工人的罢工，已经有两个月了。罢工的浪潮，在一个工业部门还没有平息，在其他各部门中又升腾起来，已经参加罢工的劳动人民，总计已超过了一百万人。
    法国的统治者们急忙设法在议会中通过法律，企图给和平战士们严厉的惩罚，以为这样就能为扩大战争生产和顺利领受美国军火创造必要的条件。但是，在法律实行以后，法国各港口已发生了好几次码头工人断然拒绝装载预定运往越南的战争物资，以及断然拒绝起卸自外国运来的军事装备的事件。
    民主势力反对反动势力的斗争，是越来越激烈了。不久以前，当群众罢工开始的时候，还有许多工人说，他们所要的不过是改善一下他们的物质条件，“不要牵涉到政治上去”。可是到了目前，在法国工人阶级中，明白争取面包的斗争是与争取和平、争取自由的斗争分不开的人，是越来越多了。电力煤气工人罢工中所发生的一些事情，更帮助人民大众消除了对资产阶级民主的幻想。政府派兵到电力站和煤气厂，强迫工人复工，但工人们拒绝屈服，于是就遭到大批的逮捕和法庭的审判。
    最广大的人民阶层支援罢工者。在煤气工厂工人受审时，好几万的示威者坚持要求立即释放被告人。法庭在群众压力下，一批批地释放了罢工者，许多被释放的工人，立刻申请加入共产党。工人们在管理当局让步和提高工人工资后，才宣布停止罢工，并且声明将继续斗争。
    不管是侮蔑宣传，警察的恐怖，或是花样翻新的“穷凶极恶”的法律的威吓，都挡不住强大的和平战士运动的成长和加强。
