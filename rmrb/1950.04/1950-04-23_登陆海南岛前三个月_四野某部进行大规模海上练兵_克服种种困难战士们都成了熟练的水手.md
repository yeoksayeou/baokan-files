Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 21st. A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, which successfully completed the Hainan Island landing mission, conducted nearly three months of large-scale naval training prior to this large-scale cross-sea landing operation. With the firm determination to "conquer the sea and eliminate the remaining enemies," all commanders and fighters overcame numerous difficulties, improved their naval combat tactics and techniques, and laid a victorious foundation for the rapid liberation of Hainan Island.

Naval training was conducted under extremely difficult material conditions. There were only a few dilapidated wooden boats available for training. Under the leadership of cadres and party members, a ship repair campaign was launched in all units. The soldiers went to cut wood and find materials themselves, quickly repaired the dilapidated boats, and then organized the boatmen who were mobilized to participate in the war into teams, educated them, enlightened their class consciousness, and provided appropriate care for their lives and families. After recognizing the victorious situation of the revolutionary war and the great historical task of eliminating the remnant bandits and liberating Hainan Island, the boatmen actively expressed their determination to resolutely send the troops to Hainan Island.

During the training, the leadership pointed out the advantages of wooden boats for crossing the sea: they are light, have small targets, and are easy to land. At the same time, they emphasized that it would be a very arduous task to rely on these wooden boats to cross dozens of miles of straits to eliminate the remaining enemies on the island. Therefore, every commander and fighter must learn a set of naval combat tactics and techniques in this training. All units selected a large number of brave and resourceful squad and platoon cadres and soldiers, organized "sailor training teams" and "shooting training teams," and appointed experienced boatmen and soldiers as instructors. First, the instructors explained how to punt, pull the sail, row a boat, how to use wind power and master the direction. After the explanation, they would first find one or two soldiers to do the same, and the other commanders and fighters would watch from the side and offer suggestions. After practicing like this for a few days, many soldiers learned these skills. Then, according to each person's strengths, they were assigned to manage a boat, with the instructor guiding them from the side. In this way, in a very short period of time, the soldiers became skilled sailors.

At the beginning of navigation exercises, because most of the commanders and fighters were northerners who were unfamiliar with the sea, many people suffered from seasickness. In order to solve this problem, the cadres repeatedly explained that the main reason for seasickness was that they were not used to sitting on sea boats, so they called on everyone to practice more and diligently to fight the sea. At the same time, swings and wave logs were generally set up to allow everyone to exercise in order to reduce seasickness. In navigation exercises, a method of going from near to far was adopted. Initially, they practiced on the seaside, and after becoming proficient, they held long-distance voyages. The commanders and fighters, through diligent practice, finally overcame the difficulty of seasickness.

At this time, the soldiers further put forward the slogan "Do not bow to the sea" and began long-distance navigation exercises. Many small wooden boats returned after four or five days of long-distance voyages, gaining rich experience, and also repelled several enemy ships attempting to harass them. The soldiers said with full confidence: "To learn skills, you have to go to the sea!"

Landing operation exercises were an important part of the navigation exercises. The commanders and fighters first became proficient in the actions of getting on and off the boat, and then sailed to islands dozens or even hundreds of miles away to conduct landing exercises, thus gaining experience in the coordinated actions of various ships. In order to prevent the ships from being damaged, the soldiers put forward the slogan "Take care of the ships as if they were your lives," and a unit of soldiers drew up a "Ship Care Pact." A large wooden boat of a certain unit was damaged by waves, and company commander Zhang Guisheng led the entire company to repair it overnight.

Because all units fully and correctly applied military democracy in training, the wisdom and creativity of the soldiers were greatly inspired. The soldiers improved various navigation techniques and equipment. In order to prevent the mortar company of a certain unit from being affected by the rolling of the ship, they created a horizontal angle device to determine the firing angle according to the size of the waves and the speed of propulsion. The "Water Shooting Essentials" created by soldier Yu Zhichen of a certain company has won the company's commendation and the regiment's circular praise.

After months of diligent naval training, 3,000 skilled sailors emerged from a certain army. They were able to master the ebb and flow of the tide, wind direction, and direction like experienced old sailors, and skillfully drive ships on long-distance voyages in the wind and waves. The soldiers generally achieved no seasickness, learned the skills of getting on and off the boat, landing, and shooting on the water; the cadres were more familiar with the coordination and command of various actions, and further mastered naval combat tactics. Therefore, before the cross-sea operation, the commanders and fighters of all units scrambled to request to undertake the assault mission on Hainan Island, determined to strive to become heroes of the cross-sea operation.

　　登陆海南岛前三个月
    四野某部进行大规模海上练兵
    克服种种困难战士们都成了熟练的水手
    【新华社海南前线二十一日电】胜利完成海南岛登陆任务的人民解放军第四野战军某部，在此次大举渡海登陆作战前，曾进行了近三个月的大规模的海上练兵。全体指战员在“征服海洋、消灭残敌”的坚强决心下，克服了重重困难，提高了海上作战的战术与技术，为迅速解放海南岛打下了胜利的基础。
    海上练兵是在极端困难的物质条件下进行的。练兵时只有很少一些破旧的木船。在干部与党员的带头下，各部普遍地展开了抢修船只运动。战士们自己去砍木头、找寻器材，把一只只的破船很快地修理好，接着就把动员来参战的船工都编好了队进行教育，启发他们的阶级觉悟，并对他们的生活、家庭给以适当的照顾。船工们在认清了革命战争的胜利形势和消灭残匪解放海南岛的伟大历史任务后，都积极地表示坚决把部队送到海南岛去。
    练兵时，领导上一方面指出木船渡海的优点：轻便、目标小、容易登陆；同时也着重指出要靠这种木船渡过数十里的海峡消灭岛上残敌，是一件非常艰巨的任务。因此每一个指战员，必须要在这次练兵中学会一套海上作战的战术、技术。各部选拔了大批勇敢而机敏的班、排干部和战士，组织“水手训练队”、“射击训练队”，以经验多的船工和战士充当教员。首先由教员讲解怎样撑篙、拉篷、划船，怎样利用风力和掌握方向，讲完了以后，先从战士中找出一两个人照样做，其他的指战员们则在旁边看，提意见。这样练习了几天后，就有很多战士学会了这些本领；然后再按各人的特长分工来掌握一只船，由教员在旁指导。这样，在很短时间里，战士们都成了熟练的水手。
    航海练习开始时，由于部队指战员们大部是不熟悉海洋的北方人，晕船的人很多。为了解决这个问题，干部一方面反复讲解晕船主要原因是初坐海船不习惯的原故，因此号召大家多练、勤练与大海斗争；一方面并普遍设立了秋千、浪木，让大家锻炼，以减少晕船现象。在航海练习上，采取由近而远的办法，最初是在海边练习，熟练以后，再举行长距离的航行。指战员们由于勤练苦练，最后终于克服了晕船的困难。
    这时战士们就进一步地提出了“不向大海低头”的口号，开始远航练习。很多小木船在经过四、五天的远程航行后，取得了丰富的经验归来，还有几次击退了企图骚扰的敌舰。战士们满怀信心地说：“要练本领，就得到大海里去！”
    登陆作战的演习是航海练习中的一个重要部分，指战员们首先熟练了上下船的动作，然后再乘船远航到数十里甚至百余里以外的岛屿上进行登陆演习，因而获得了各种船只协同动作的经验。为了不使船只受损坏，战士们提出“爱护船只像爱护性命”的口号，某部战士订出《爱船公约》。某部一大只木船被浪打坏了，连长张桂生带领全连连夜把它修好。
    由于各部在练兵中都充分地、正确地运用了军事民主，因此大大地启发了战士们的智慧和创造力。战士们改良了各种航海技术和用具。某部迫击炮连为使发射时不受船身颠簸的影响，创造了水平角度器，根据浪的大小及推进速度，测定发射的角度。某连战士余志臣所创造的“水上射击要领”，已获得了连的记功和团的通令表扬。
    经过数月的海上勤练，某军即涌现出三千名熟练的水手，他们能够像多年的老航工一样掌握海潮涨落、风向、方向，熟练地驾驶船只在风浪中作长距离航行。战士们普遍做到了不晕船、学会了上下船、登陆和水上射击的技术；干部更熟悉了各种动作的协同和指挥，进一步掌握了海上作战的战术。因此在渡海作战之前，各部指战员们都争着要求担任海南岛的突击任务，决心争取当渡海作战的英雄。
