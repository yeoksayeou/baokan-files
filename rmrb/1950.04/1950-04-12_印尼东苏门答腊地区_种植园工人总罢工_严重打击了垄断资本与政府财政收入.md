　　General Strike of Plantation Workers in East Sumatra, Indonesia
    Severely Hits Monopoly Capital and Government Fiscal Revenue
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] A general strike has been launched by plantation workers in East Sumatra, Indonesia (the richest plantation area). According to a comprehensive report from Aneta News Agency, plantation workers in East Sumatra launched a general strike on the 3rd due to the refusal of capitalists to increase wages. The general strike has been carried out in three stages: first in tobacco plantations, then in rubber, palm oil and fiber plantations, and finally in tea plantations. As of the 10th, the general strike is still ongoing. This strike will severely打击monopoly capital and the Indonesian government's fiscal revenue. Indonesian Ministry of Economy advisor Skeimer stated on the 4th that the result of the general strike in East Sumatra plantations would be extremely serious for Indonesia. If the strike prevents the tobacco harvest (which is scheduled to begin within half a month), it will cause a loss of 30 million US dollars. An expert stated that the strike will cost the Indonesian government 1 million Indonesian Rupiah in tax revenue per day. The Indonesian government has sent Minister of Labor Wilopo to Medan on the 8th in an attempt to use pressure to find a way to end the strike on the spot.
    The strike by workers of the Deli Railway Company in East Sumatra, which began on March 22, and the strike by workers at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, which began on April 3, are both ongoing.

　　印尼东苏门答腊地区
    种植园工人总罢工
    严重打击了垄断资本与政府财政收入
    【新华社十一日讯】印尼东苏门答腊（最富庶的种植园区）的种植园工人举行了总罢工。综合安尼塔通讯社消息：东苏门答腊的种植园工人，因资方拒绝增加工资，自三日起举行总罢工。总罢工已分三个阶段进行：首先是在烟草种植园，其次是在树胶、棕榈油和纤维种植园，再次则是在茶叶种植园。总罢工迄十日止尚在坚持中。这一罢工将严重地打击垄断资本与印尼政府的财政收入。印尼经济部顾问斯凯米尔四日称：东苏门答腊种植园总罢工的结果，对于印尼将是极其严重的。如果罢工使烟草不能进行收获（按收获将于半月之内开始），那将造成三千万美元的损失。某专家称：罢工一天将使印尼政府损失岁收一百万印尼币。印尼政府已派劳工部长维洛坡于八日赴棉兰企图使用压力就地设法结束罢工。
    自三月二十二日开始的东苏门答腊日里铁路公司工人的罢工，以及自四月三日开始的雅加达外港丹绒布录码头工人的罢工，都在坚持中。
