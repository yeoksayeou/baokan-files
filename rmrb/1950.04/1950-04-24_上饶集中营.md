Shangrao Concentration Camp
    Shao Yu

In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of over 200,000 men launched a treacherous attack on the more than 10,000 soldiers of the New Fourth Army's southern Anhui force, who were persevering in arduous struggles behind enemy lines north and south of the Yangtze River, creating the shocking Anhui Incident. Many captured New Fourth Army officers and soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu, who was one of the patriotic individuals imprisoned at the time, used his skilled brush, with intense hatred and love, to depict the facts he witnessed on that day, creating the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The heinous crimes of the Kuomintang special agent bandit gang, and the heroic deeds of revolutionary fighters who would rather die than submit, are all powerfully expressed. This collection consists of twenty-three pieces, serialized in this edition. Eighteen pieces have been previously published, and the nineteenth and twentieth pieces are published today.

    Before the Riot
    The Maojialing Riot
    That day finally came.

    In May 1942, in Maojialing (a detention room near the concentration camp), a full-scale riot of more than twenty people broke out. Relying on the comrades' determination, courage, alertness, and meticulous organizational preparation, the comrades, empty-handed, seized more than twelve rifles and one machine gun from the special agent bandit gang's guard troops, broke through the back door, and headed straight for the mountains of Fujian.

    暴动之前
    茅家岭暴动
    那一天，终於来了。
    一九四二年五月，在茅家岭（集中营附近的一个禁闭室），爆发了二十余人的全体大暴动。依靠同志们的坚决、勇敢、机警与严密的组织准备，同志们赤手空拳，缴了特务匪帮守卫部队十二余条步枪，一挺机枪，冲破后门，直奔福建大山而去。
