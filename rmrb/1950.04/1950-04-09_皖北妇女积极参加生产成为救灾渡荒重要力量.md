Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th: The broad masses of women in the Northern Anhui region have become an important force in production and disaster relief. Because Northern Anhui suffered heavy disasters last year, the CCP Northern Anhui District Committee and the Northern Anhui Democratic Women's Federation, at the first women's work conference in the Northern Anhui District this January, clearly pointed out that women's work should focus on mobilizing and organizing women in disaster areas to actively participate in production for self-salvation. After the meeting, the CCP committees at all levels followed this instruction, quickly deploying cadres to various places to establish women's federations and carry out work. So far, most of the women's federations in various special districts, counties, and districts have been established, and the women's federations at all levels have resolutely carried out their work in accordance with the work policy of mobilizing women to participate in production for self-salvation. Currently, women in various parts of Northern Anhui have actively engaged in dike repair and various sideline productions. Women account for one-third of the dike construction workers in Sixian County. In Tonglu County (newly established county, part of Tongcheng and Lujiang), more than 500 women are repairing dikes alongside men. Women play a key role in sideline productions such as spinning, grinding flour, making tofu, and weaving mats. In Shicun District of Suxian County, more than 4,700 women are engaged in grinding flour, weaving baskets, and spinning. In Daiwei Village of the county, the lives of 40 disaster-stricken households who had run out of food were maintained because the women took the lead in organizing themselves for production and self-salvation. In Jianggang Village, Sihong County, fourteen women cut 2,800 catties of grass in two days. During the spring plowing season, women in various places have actively taken on the spring plowing tasks left by the men working on the dikes. After the men in Zhang Daying Village of Fuyang went to work on the dikes, more than 70 women in the village organized 13 mutual aid groups and harrowed all the millet fields in the village in four days. Women in Chunzhu Village of Susong County helped dike construction workers hoe 30 mu of wheat in two days. Women in Xinqiao Village of Suxian County plowed the land for spring plowing, overcoming the difficulty of a lack of draft animals. Women's federations in various places have also expanded the organization of women's federations by combining production with women's work. Before March 8th alone, more than 170,000 women in Suxian Special District and Fuyang County participated in the women's federations.

　　皖北妇女积极参加生产成为救灾渡荒重要力量
    【新华社合肥七日电】皖北区广大妇女已成为生产救灾中的重要力量。由于皖北去年遭灾很重，中共皖北区党委和皖北民主妇联在今年一月皖北区首次妇女工作会议上，即曾明确指出妇女工作应以发动和组织灾区妇女积极参加生产自救为中心任务。会后，中共各级党委即遵照此一指示，迅速调配干部，分赴各地建立妇联组织和开展工作。到目前为止，各专区、县、区的妇联大部都已建立，各级妇联会均坚决依照发动妇女参加生产自救的工作方针进行工作。现皖北区各地妇女已纷纷投入修堤和各种副业生产中。泗县上堤民工中妇女占三分之一。桐庐（新设县，桐城庐江各一部）县有五百余妇女与男子并肩修堤。在纺织、拐粉、磨豆腐、编席等副业生产中，妇女更起了骨干作用。宿县时村区妇女参加拐粉、编筐和纺织生产的就有四千七百余人。该县戴圩村由于妇女首先组织起来生产自救，使该村四十户断炊灾民的生活得以维持。泗洪县蒋岗村十四个妇女两天即砍草二千八百斤。在春耕中，各地妇女都积极承担起上堤男工们所留下的春耕任务。阜阳张大营村男人上堤以后，该村七十多个妇女即组织了十三个互助小组，四天就耙好了全村的秣子地。宿松县春竹村妇女两天内帮助上堤民工锄麦三十亩。宿县新桥村妇女拉犁进行春耕，克服了耕牛缺乏的困难。各地妇联会并从结合生产进行妇女工作中扩大了妇联的组织，仅宿县专区和阜阳县在三八节前即有十七万余妇女参加了妇联会。
