Gold and Silver are Prohibited from Circulation
    People are Allowed to Store Them, and Can Exchange Them at the People's Bank.
    To the Editor:
    In the newspapers, we often see cases of people privately reselling gold and silver yuan, which shows that there must be a lot of gold coins left over in the market. Although the People's Bank has a sign up for exchanging gold, it is limited to purchasing public bonds. However, many people have gold and want to turn it into production funds, but have nowhere to exchange it. I hope to inform the relevant departments to pay attention to this.
                              Xie Jiaxiang
    Mr. Xie Jiaxiang:
    Regarding your question, according to the reply from the People's Bank of China, it can be handled in accordance with Article 3 of the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Gold and Silver in North China Region": "... within the liberated areas, people are allowed to store it, and are allowed to exchange it for RMB at the listed price..." Therefore, people exchanging gold for RMB at the People's Bank is not limited to buying public bonds. However, the People's Bank has two listed prices for exchanging gold: the price is higher for buying public bonds; the price is lower for not buying public bonds.

　　金银禁止流通
    允许人民储存，并得向人民银行兑换。编辑同志：
    在报纸上，常常看到私自捣卖黄金银元的事情，可知市面上遗留的黄金硬币一定很多。人民银行，虽挂牌收兑黄金，但只限购买折实公债，但有不少群众，存有黄金，想变为生产资金，而无处兑换，希转告有关部门，予以注意才好。
                              谢家骧谢家骧君：
    你的问题，据中国人民银行答复，可按华北区金银管理暂行办法第三条之规定“……在解放区内允许人民储存，并允许向人民银行按牌价兑换人民券……”办理。所以人民用黄金向人民银行兑换人民券，并不限于买公债。但人民银行收兑黄金有两种牌价，买公债的，牌价较高；不买公债的牌价较低。
