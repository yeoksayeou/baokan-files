Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 16th: Wang Guoman, a farmer from Famocun Village, Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, has set a new record for grain production. The Liaoning Provincial People's Government has awarded him the honorary title of "Provincial Special-Class Model Worker for Improved Production Technology." Wang Guoman, now the village chief, was originally a tenant farmer in the old society. After the local liberation, he was allocated 6.3 mu of land during the land reform, greatly increasing his enthusiasm for production. He participated in a ploughing group, actively improved farming techniques, and created various methods for increasing production. As a result, in 1948, his grain yield increased by more than 150% compared to the normal year's yield, and in 1949, it increased by 103.5% compared to 1948 (an increase of 408.7% compared to the normal year's yield). Wang Guoman used a variety of methods to increase production, the most important of which were land improvement and soil amendment. He transformed low-yielding land into fertile land by digging ditches to drain accumulated water and by mixing clay soil with sandy soil and sandy soil with clay soil to improve the soil of low-lying areas. At the same time, he paid special attention to accumulating fertilizer and applying manure. Secondly, he carefully selected seeds and exchanged seeds, and also paid close attention to hoeing, weeding, and pest control, all of which effectively guaranteed the realization of his production increase plan. Another significant feature of Wang Guoman's production increase methods is that he is good at breaking with old agricultural production experiences and creating new ones, seeking progress through continuous improvement of old farming techniques. His opinion on the local appropriate sowing period is an example. He believes that it is not necessary to wait until the迎山花 (Yingshanhua) flowers bloom to sow seeds, but that as long as the leaves turn green, it is sufficient. Facts have proved that his view is correct.

The Liaoning Provincial People's Government attached great importance to Wang Guoman's production increase methods and issued a decision on the 9th of this month posthumously recognizing Wang Guoman as a special-class model worker for improved production technology in the province. Chairman Liu Lanbo of the Provincial Government also instructed the county head of Kuandian County to personally deliver the pennant and new agricultural tools and other prizes to Wang Guoman's home on behalf of the Provincial Government. The Liaoning Dazhong Daily also published an editorial entitled "Learn from Wang Guoman," calling on farmers in various parts of the province to learn Wang Guoman's production methods and research spirit, so that backward agricultural production techniques can be continuously improved, so as to complete and exceed this year's agricultural production tasks.

　　辽东省农民王国满创增产粮食新纪录
    荣获“全省特等改良生产技术劳动模范”称号
    【新华社安东十六日电】辽东省宽甸县发磨存村农民王国满创造了增产粮食的新纪录，该省人民政府特赠给他以“全省特等改良生产技术劳动模范”的光荣称号。现在是村长的王国满，在旧社会里原来是一个佃农，当地解放后，他在土地改革中分得了六亩三分地，生产热情大大提高。他参加了插犋组，积极地改进了农作技术，并创造了多种多样的增产办法。因此，他在一九四八年就使粮食比常年产量增加了百分之一百五十强，一九四九年又比一九四八年增产百分之一百零三点五（比常年产量增加了百分之四百零八点七）。王国满所使用的增产办法是多种多样的，其中最主要的是修地和改良土质。他用挖沟导出积水和用黏土地掺沙、沙地掺黏土的办法，改造洼地土壤，同时又特别注意多积肥上粪，使原来产量很低的土地变为良田。其次，他又认真地进行选种和换种，同时很注意铲趟、除害虫等工作，这些都有效地保证了他的增产计划的实现。王国满的增产办法还有一个显著的特点，就是：他善于打破旧的农业生产经验，善于创造新的经验，在不断地改进旧的耕作技术中求进步。他对当地适时的播种期的意见就是一个例子。他认为不必等到迎山花开才播种，只要树叶发绿就可以了。事实证明，他的看法是正确的。
    辽东省人民政府极为重视王国满的增产办法，于本月九日发出追认王国满为该省特等改良生产技术劳动模范的决定。省府刘澜波主席并指示宽甸县县长代表省府亲将锦旗和新式农具等奖品送到王国满家里。辽东大众报也以“向王国满学习”为题发表社论，号召该省各地农民学习王国满的生产办法和钻研精神，使落后的农业生产技术不断地提高和改进，以完成和超过今年的农业生产任务。
