　　Preventing Negligence and Improving Work
　　New China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Accepts Li Hua's Criticism
　　Editor:
　　As our cooperative was summarizing the work of the first quarter of 1950, we saw the opinion in the "People's Garden" of April 6th regarding the need for clear differentiation of prices for goods. This is a very good guide for our future business studies and also shows Comrade Li Hua's enthusiasm and concern for the development of our business. We express our sincere gratitude for the opinions raised by Comrade Li Hua.
　　Our cooperative mistakenly sold the small art checkers, priced at 1,800 yuan per set, as the large art checkers priced at 7,200 yuan per set. This was due to negligence in our work and a lack of responsibility. We have conducted a strict review, clearly stipulating that in the future, we must distinguish between the names, specifications, and quality of goods, and accurately understand and grasp market conditions. We have also instructed every colleague to raise their awareness, prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and improve our work.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　New China Supply and Marketing Cooperative

　　防止疏忽改进工作
    新中国供销社接受里华批评编辑同志：
    本社正当总结一九五○年第一季度工作时，看到四月六日人民园地所载关于本社货价应分别清楚的意见，这是对于我们今后业务钻研很好的指南，也表现了里华同志对我们业务开展的热忱与关心。我们对于里华同志所提的意见，致以诚恳的谢意。
    本社误将每副一千八百元的小美术跳棋售为每副七千二百元的大美术跳棋价，这是工作上的疏忽和责任心不够所致。我们已进行严格的检讨，明确规定今后必须分别物品名称、规格、质量，与正确的了解和掌握行情；并责成每个工作同志提高自觉，防止事情的再次发生，改进我们的工作。
                                  新中国供销社
