　　Actively Enlist and Participate in the War · Over-fulfill Military Grain Loan Quotas
    Hainan Island People Enthusiastically Support the Front
    Welcoming the Army's Crossing of the Sea to Annihilate the Remaining Bandits on the Island
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 22nd] After the People's Liberation Army reached the Leizhou Peninsula, the people in the liberated areas and the areas to be liberated on Hainan Island enthusiastically launched a wave of supporting the front lines by enlisting, participating in the war, and lending grain, welcoming the army to cross the sea. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the people in the liberated areas are unfolding the work of enlisting and participating in the war with a high degree of awareness. In a short period of one month, the number of people of all ethnic groups enlisting has greatly exceeded the estimated number. In Ledong County alone, the number of people enlisting exceeded the plan by more than three times. In Zhongqiang Township of that county, the number of people enlisting exceeded one thousand. The people in the liberated areas regard enlisting as the most glorious thing. At the mobilization meetings for enlisting, many village representatives, village chiefs, and heads of farmers' associations took the lead in enlisting. Many Li women, who usually did not come forward, enthusiastically stepped onto the stage to encourage their husbands to enlist. Everywhere, there were moving scenes of wives sending off their husbands, mothers sending off their sons, and younger brothers sending off their older brothers to the front lines. The people of all villages actively took the initiative to solve difficulties for those who enlisted and helped them settle their families.
    The people in the areas to be liberated, although they have suffered from the cruel conscription, looting, and enslavement of the remaining bandits for a long time, have also enthusiastically launched a movement to support the front lines, just like the people in the liberated areas. The grain loan and war participation organizations were all successfully completed more than a month ago, and the enlistment movement has also been rapidly launched. The People's Government, in order to take care of the people in the areas to be liberated who have suffered from the looting and devastation of the remaining bandits and whose lives are relatively difficult, tried its best to reduce the burden of grain loans on the people in the areas to be liberated. However, when the People's Government announced the grain loan, all localities completed it with amounts exceeding one, two, or even four or five times the quota. An old woman in her seventies in a certain township in northern Hainan generously recognized a loan of five dou of rice, saying, "Lending these few dou of rice to the army is not even enough for those 'mountain wolves' (referring to the Kuomintang bandit troops) to rob once!" Many people in the areas to be liberated sent people to the liberated areas to recognize loans to the People's Government, saying, "We only ask that the Liberation Army come quickly, and we are willing to lend most of the rice we have prepared to get through the spring famine." Therefore, the grain loan work was quickly overfulfilled. Taking two counties in northern Hainan as an example, they lent out 22,000 shi of rice (200 jin per shi), and Yai County in southern Hainan alone lent out 4,000 shi of rice. The people in the areas to be liberated not only lent out large quantities of grain, but also organized war participation labor teams. In northern Hainan alone, there were 20,000 people in the labor teams. They had long prepared everything, and as soon as the army crossed the sea, they immediately cooperated with the army to wipe out the remaining bandits on the island.

　　踊跃参军参战·超额认借军粮
    海南岛人民热烈支前
    迎接大军渡海全歼岛上残匪
    【新华社海南前线二十二日电】海南岛解放区和待解放区的人民，在人民解放军进抵雷州半岛后，即热烈地掀起了参军、参战、借粮等支援前线，迎接渡海大军的热潮。解放区的人民，在人民政府领导下，都以高度的觉悟来展开参军、参战的工作。在短短的一个月时间内，各族人民参军的数量，就大大超过了预计的数目。仅乐东一个县，参军人数就超过了计划三倍以上。该县仲强乡，参军的人数超过一千人。解放区人民把参军看作最光荣的事。在参军动员大会上许多村代表、村主任、农会主任等都带头参军。很多一向不出头露面的黎族妇女，也都热烈走上讲台鼓励自己的丈夫参军。到处出现妻送夫、母送子、弟送哥上前线的热烈动人的场面。各村人民都积极主动地替参军者解决困难，帮助他们安置家属。
    待解放区人民，虽然长期遭受残匪的残酷拉夫、抢劫和奴役，但是也和解放区人民一样热烈地展开支援前线运动。借粮和参战组织在一个多月前就全部胜利完成，参军运动亦已迅速展开。人民政府为照顾待解放区人民饱受残匪的抢劫摧残，生活比较痛苦，所以尽量减少待解放区人民借粮的负担。但是当人民政府宣布借粮后，各地都以超额一倍、二倍、甚至四、五倍的数目来完成。琼北某乡一位七十余岁的老婆婆慷慨地认借五斗米，她说：“借出这几斗米给大军，还不够那些‘山狼’（指国民党匪军）抢一次的！”很多待解放区的人民，并纷纷派人到解放区向人民政府认借，他们说：“只求解放军快来，我们愿将预备过春荒的米粮大部借出来。”因此，借粮工作迅速超额完成。以琼北两个县为例，就借出米粮二万二千石（每石二百斤），琼南崖县一个县，就借出米粮四千石。待解放区的人民不但借出了大批粮食，还纷纷组织参战民工队，仅琼北一地，民工队就有二万人。他们很早就做好了一切准备工作，等到渡海大军一来，马上就配合大军消灭岛上残匪。
