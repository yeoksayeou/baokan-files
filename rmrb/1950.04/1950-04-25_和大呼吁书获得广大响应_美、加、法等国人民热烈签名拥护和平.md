Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: TASS Moscow, April 23rd: Pravda published an interview with Robertson, the newspaper's New York correspondent, regarding the American peace movement.

Robertson said: The famous appeal of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has been enthusiastically welcomed by millions of Americans. In addition to the members of the American delegation who participated in the meeting, the appeal has been signed by many prominent figures in the United States. The National Committee of the All-American Trade Union Peace Congress in Chicago is launching a signature campaign demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. Thousands of residents in Chicago, Boston, Calais, Springfield, and many other cities and towns across the country have already signed this demand.

Robertson continued: The responsibilities of American peace fighters and those who fight for peace and democracy are particularly arduous. They must not only expose the warmongers but also establish in their country an organized movement resistant to the criminal activities of warmongers, sufficient to ensure that the American people enjoy lasting peace and maintain cooperative and friendly relations with other countries, especially the Soviet Union. Regardless of intimidation, persecution, and terror, people of various political beliefs, religions, and social classes have risen up to fight for peace, condemn the arms race, condemn the preparation for barbaric atomic warfare, and demand a peaceful resolution of US-Soviet relations. The Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Chicago on May 29th will greatly promote the development of the American peace movement.

In Vancouver, those who support peace are seeking signatures from people from all walks of life on a petition demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs. A similar signature campaign will also be held in Winnipeg on the 29th. The Youth Peace Congress was held in Montreal on the 15th, with 105 representatives from 33 youth, labor union, and church groups participating. The meeting decided to organize a "Peace Torch" relay race from Montreal to Toronto on the opening day of the Peace Congress. Steel, electricity, wool, and textile workers' unions in major Canadian cities have selected many representatives to attend the Peace Congress. Representatives are also being selected in various enterprises. After the Peace Congress concludes on May 8th, its representatives will submit a petition demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs to the Canadian government. On the same day, a grand rally in support of peace will be held in Toronto.
