　　The Chinese Communist Party's Siying Village Branch in Luan County Actively Leads the Masses in Production for Self-Relief, Ensuring Timely Spring Planting and Increased Grain Production

　　Siying Village, Seventh District, Luan County, Hebei Province, is located near the west bank of the Luan River. Last year's flood was severe, and even including the wheat harvest, the harvest was only 42% of a normal year. After the autumn harvest, the Party members and cadres calculated that the grain harvested throughout the year was only enough for the village's 146 households, with 661 people, to eat until the end of the old lunar year. Three months of food were lacking until the wheat harvest, and six months of food were lacking until the autumn harvest. After the autumn, the masses were pessimistic and negative, and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors. The village's CCP branch, which had a solid foundation and close ties with the masses, was supported by the vast majority of the villagers. After the flood, the branch comrades not only were not intimidated by the disaster but also immediately responded to the call of the Party and the government to lead the masses in production for self-relief and economize to prepare for famine. The village branch secretary, Wang Zhenxiang (accountant), deputy secretary Wang Geming, Party members Wang Shouxin (village director), Liu Ziqiang (Youth League secretary), Li Jin, and others, a total of 21 people, held a branch meeting to specifically study and discuss ways to lead the masses in production to overcome the famine, deciding to use the village's original eight carts for transportation while organizing the masses to quarry stones, repair the river, and repair bridges. They decided that each person would mobilize a small area (five or six households), explaining and carefully calculating how much food was available, door to door, to overcome the masses' concerns about losing money in transportation and earning little from quarrying stones. Party member Wang Shouxin said, "If we fall behind and don't think of ways for the masses first, we will all be held accountable at the branch meeting." Village branch secretary Wang Zhenxiang also instructed everyone, "Our leadership is leadership, we must rely on patient explanation, and never commit commandism, otherwise the masses will regard good things as bad things." After the meeting, they went to their assigned households to explain and mobilize, and at the same time organize everyone to produce. Wang Geming, Wang Fengyi, and Wang Zhenxiang led the masses to Peijia Mountain three times to see how to start quarrying stones. Liu Ziqiang returned to the Youth League and organized 20 members, uniting them around the Party. Xia Jingyou (administrative officer responsible for civil affairs) hitched up his cart and pulled grain to Laoting County, then returned to pull wood, and brought along the other seven households with carts to work together. Only Wang Xian's group showed no sign of activity. At the seventh day's branch meeting, everyone criticized him, and Wang Xian confessed that he "put personal considerations first and did not keep the important matter of leading the masses in mind." After everyone's help, he realized his backwardness and said, "You all have mobilized your groups, I guarantee to mobilize mine within five days." After the meeting, he went door-to-door to mobilize and discuss methods, and by the end of the fifth day, they had all been mobilized. In the process of leading the masses in quarrying stones, the branch also organized voluntary mutual aid groups, using democratic work evaluation methods, to avoid those who quarried more stones from suffering losses. From October 15th of the old lunar calendar last year to the end of the old year, the 56 people who participated in quarrying stones earned 7,200 jin of millet. The 23 people who dammed the river mouth earned 2,480 jin of millet. The 15 people who repaired the bridge earned 1,180 jin of millet. The 62 people who pushed ore cars (using small carts to transport stones on small railways) earned 3,600 jin of millet. The eight rubber-tired carts earned money from transportation, and by the beginning of November of the old lunar calendar, 14 households in the village freely formed partnerships and bought eight more carts (totaling 16), earning 19,200 jin of millet, excluding food for people and feed for horses. By the end of the old year, the entire village had earned a total of 33,660 jin of millet. Calculating one jin of millet as one and a half jin of coarse grain, it was enough for the entire village to eat for 52 days, shortening this year's lean season by two months.

　　During the New Year, fearing that everyone would plan to rest and relax, the branch seized the opportunity to engage in sideline occupations. On the third day of the New Year, Xia Jingyou and Li Jin hitched up the carts, calling another 14 carts, and went to pull wood together. By mid-March, in addition to continuing sideline occupations, 23 households had begun plowing the land. Because Siying Village had done well in sideline occupations, not only had the number of livestock not decreased last year, but they had also bought 11 more mules and cattle (now the entire village has 22 mules, 7 cattle, and 14 donkeys), so there were no difficulties in plowing the land this year. Government loans of grain were also used for production. The dredging of the Luan River has now begun, and Siying Village has sent another 40 people to participate in river repair, ensuring that there is no idle person in the entire village. Women and children throughout the village are going to the fields to dig wild vegetables, saving food and expenses to ensure that no one starves to death. The branch also proposed to engage in intensive cultivation this year, plowing the land four times and fertilizing it once, and applying more manure than last year to strive for increased grain production.

　　中共滦县司营村支部积极领导群众生产自救  保证及时春耕增产粮食
    河北省滦县七区司营村，紧靠滦河西岸，去年水灾严重，连麦收计算在内，才不过四成二的年景。秋后党员干部们计算一下，全年打的粮食，刚够全村一四六户、六六一口人吃到今年旧历正月底。到麦收时还缺三个多月吃的，到大秋时就缺六个月的。秋后群众悲观消极，坏分子趁机造谣。该村中共支部，素有基础，团结群众也密切，为全村绝大多数群众所拥护。水灾后该支部全体同志，不但未被灾情吓倒，并且立刻响应上级党和政府号召，领导群众，生产自救，节约备荒。村支书王振祥（司账员）、副支书王阁明、党员王守信（村主任）、刘自强（青年团支书）、李进等二十一人，在支部会上，具体研究讨论领导群众生产渡荒的办法，决定让本村原有的八辆车搞运输，同时组织群众打石头、修河、修桥……。他们决定每人发动一小片（五六家），挨门逐户的解释和细算够吃不够吃的办法，克服群众怕搞运输赔钱，打石头赚钱少的顾虑。党员王守信说：“咱如果落了后，不去给群众先想办法，咱大家在支部会上追究责任”。村支书王振祥又嘱咐大家说：“咱领导是领导，要靠咱耐心解释，千万别犯命令主义，不然好事群众也会当成坏事。”散会后，他们就各自到自己分的几家去解释动员，同时组织大家生产。王阁明、王封义、王振祥领着群众到裴家山去了三次，看打石头从那下手，刘自强回到青年部门把二十名团员组织起来，团结在党的周围；夏景有（行政是民政委员）把自己车套上向乐亭县拉粮，回来拉木料，并把另外七户有车的带动起来一齐干。只有王献领导的那一组没一点动静。在第七天的支部会上，大家批评了他，王献检讨了“是先为个人打算，没把领导群众大事放在心里”。经过大家的帮助，他认识了自己的落后，说：“你们各组都发动起来，我在五天内保证也发动起来”。会后，他挨门动员商量办法，到五天头上也都发动了起来。支部领导群众在打石头过程中，又组织自愿互助组，用民主评工办法，省得打多的人吃亏。从去年旧历十月十五日到旧年底，参加打石头的五十六人赚小米七千二百斤。堵河口的二十三人，赚小米二千四百八十斤。修桥的十五人，赚小米一千一百八十斤。推?辘车的（用小车装石头在小铁道上走）六十二人，赚小米三千六百斤。八辆胶皮车搞运输赚了钱，到旧历十一月初，村里群众在自由搭伙中十四家又添买八辆车（共十六辆），除去人吃喂马外，赚小米一万九千二百斤。到旧年底全村共进小米三万三千六百六十斤。一人按一斤小米折成斤半粗粮计算，够全村人吃五十二天。缩短了今年两个月的青黄不接时期。
    过年时，恐怕大家都打算歇一歇，松了劲，支部便抓紧搞副业。大年初三，夏景有和李进就把大车套上，叫着另外十四辆车，一齐拉木料去。到三月中除了继续搞副业外，有二十三户开始耕地。因为司营村副业搞的好，去年牲口不但没减，还添买了十一头骡子和牛（现在全村骡二二头、牛七头、驴一四头），今年耕地没困难。政府贷粮也都用到了生产中去。现在疏浚滦河又已动工，司营村又去了四十人参加修河，保证全村没闲人。全村妇女儿童上地挖野菜，省吃俭用，保证不饿死一个人。支部并提出今年要精耕细作，地耪四遍坌一遍，还要比去年多上粪，争取增产粮食。
