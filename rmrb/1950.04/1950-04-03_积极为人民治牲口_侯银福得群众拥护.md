　　Actively Treating Livestock for the People
    Hou Yinfu Gains Mass Support

    Hou Yinfu, a veterinarian from Huyao Village, Sixth District, Pingshun County, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, overcame the erroneous idea that "veterinary medicine is less glorious than human medicine" after studying at the commissioner's office last winter and established a spirit of serving the people. Around the Lunar New Year, in order to cure the farmers' livestock as soon as possible and not delay the masses' production, he disregarded the holiday and took the initiative to go to more than ten villages with severe animal diseases, such as Anyang and Tangli, to examine and treat livestock for the farmers. He achieved great results and won the support of the people.

　　积极为人民治牲口
    侯银福得群众拥护
    山西省长治专区平顺县六区虎窑村兽医侯银福，去年冬天在专署学习后，克服了“兽医不如人医光荣”的错误思想，树立了为人民服务的精神。他在阴历春节前后，为了要把农民牲口早日治好，不耽误群众生产，便不顾过年，主动到安阳、棠梨等十余个兽病较重的村为农民检查、治疗牲口，成绩很大，深得人民拥护。
