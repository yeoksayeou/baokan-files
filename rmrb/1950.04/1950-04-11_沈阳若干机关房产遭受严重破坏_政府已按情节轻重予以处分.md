　　Several Organs' Properties in Shenyang Seriously Damaged
    Government Has Imposed Punishments According to the Seriousness of the Circumstances
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily's April 2nd report: Several organs' properties in Shenyang have suffered serious damage, and the government has imposed punishments according to the seriousness of the circumstances. When the Northeast District Insurance Company of the city moved, it completely dismantled the heating and toilet bowls on both the upper and lower floors of the building at 196 Zhongshan Road (formerly Yifa Bank); the heating equipment in the custodial property at 6 Dongguang Street was also dismantled and installed elsewhere. In addition, the phenomenon of flooding the building's foundations due to unused or poorly maintained waterways, and dismantling boilers, doors, windows, partitions, and stairs is quite common. Many houses' original heating, plumbing, glass doors, and windows are mostly incomplete and damaged. Regarding this bad phenomenon of damaging state property, the People's Government has imposed penalties according to the seriousness of the circumstances: some have been sent to the court for sentencing according to law, some have been ordered to restore them to their original state and have their houses taken back, and some are being processed.
    For this reason, the Northeast Daily published a short commentary on the 2nd entitled "Struggle Against All Acts of Destroying Public Property," pointing out that those acts of destroying state property are serious illegal acts, and propaganda and education on cherishing state property should be carried out among cadres and the masses. At the same time, it is recommended that the People's Governments in various places conduct a comprehensive and serious inspection of the management of public properties in their respective regions. Those who knowingly commit crimes should be given appropriate punishments according to the severity of their cases, and revolutionary discipline should be used to safeguard the public interests of the state and the people and to ensure the implementation of national policies and laws.

　　沈阳若干机关房产遭受严重破坏
    政府已按情节轻重予以处分
    【本报讯】据东北日报四月二日消息：沈阳若干机关房产，遭受严重破坏，政府已按情节轻重予以处分。该市东北区保险公司在搬家时，把原住中山路一九六号（原益发银行）大楼上下暖气和便池尽行拆下；东光街六号代管房屋中的暖气设备亦被拆装到了别处。另外，因水道不用或失修而把楼房地泡坏，和拆锅炉、门窗、间壁、楼梯等现象相当普遍，很多房子原来的暖气、水道、玻璃门窗等，亦多残缺不全。现人民政府对此损害国家财产的不良现象，已按情节轻重予以处罚：有的送法院依法判处，有的除令其照原样修复外，并收回房屋，有的正在处理中。
    东北日报为此于二日以《向一切破坏公共房产行为作斗争》为题，发表短评，指出那些破坏国家财产的行为乃是严重的犯法行为，在干部及群众中，应进行爱护国家财产的宣传教育。同时，建议各地人民政府，把所属地区的公共房产管理情况，作普遍的认真检查。对那些明知故犯的人，应该分别轻重给以应得的处分，用革命纪律来维护国家人民的公共利益，来保证国家政策法令的执行。
