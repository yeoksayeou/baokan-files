Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, April 15th: Shou Zhang County, a severely affected area in Pingyuan Province, has enabled 150,000 disaster victims to overcome the famine caused by flooding and laid a favorable foundation for overcoming the spring famine by fully utilizing people's representatives conferences at all levels to launch production for self-relief.

The disaster in Shou Zhang County began after the Yellow River flooded violently last autumn, and the people's embankments collapsed. A total of 350 villages in the county were affected, inundating more than 414,000 mu of land, and affecting 150,000 people. After the flooding, the county people's government immediately convened a people's representatives conference at all levels. The conference first focused on resolving the problem of the collapse of the people's embankments, which was the biggest concern of the disaster victims, and stabilized the production mood of the disaster victims. Subsequently, the participating representatives enthusiastically discussed the issue of production for self-relief. Some representatives introduced typical examples of production for self-relief at the meeting. For example, one representative introduced that a disaster victim in Zhang Fu'an Village had engaged in sideline production immediately after the flooding and earned two dan and four dou of beans within two months, solving the family's livelihood problems. As a result, the idea of relying on relief among some representatives was eliminated, thereby greatly enhancing their confidence in production for self-relief. Many representatives also formulated plans for production for self-relief at the meeting.

After the people's representatives conference at all levels was held, the production for self-relief movement was launched throughout the county. In order to adapt to the characteristics of the decentralized rural economy, the county people's government mobilized the masses from door to door to carry out various small-scale sideline productions such as flour mills and textile production; at the same time, it used methods such as work-for-relief and loans to organize larger-scale production, such as organizing ninety-eight large boats for Yellow River shipping and organizing eight hundred small carts for land transportation. The county government signed a contract with the Yellow River Bureau to organize disaster victims from ten villages to produce cattail mats, earning a total of 20,000 jin of grain. In addition, the people's government organized 5,000 people to participate in the embankment reconstruction project. The county people's government also helped disaster victims solve the sales problems of sideline production in a timely manner, accelerated the turnover of production funds, and timely solved some of the difficulties encountered by disaster victims in production. Therefore, the production for self-relief movement was greatly developed and consolidated under the support of the government.

Last December, the county convened the second people's representatives conference at all levels. The people's government introduced good typical experiences in production and disaster relief work at the meeting and criticized some villages where production and disaster relief work had been poorly done. At the meeting, the people's government also explained the government's policy of protecting private property and promoting free lending, gave appropriate punishments to cadres who violated the policy and arbitrarily drew on the land of middle peasants, and returned all the land to the middle peasants. After the meeting, the lending relationship in the county became active under the organization and mobilization of the representatives. Therefore, the production for self-relief movement was further developed. For example, after free lending, the number of disaster victims participating in cattail mat production in Jin Cheng Village increased from 69 households to 82 households, and the number of disaster victims participating in milling flour increased from 11 households to 21 households. By January, 64% of the disaster victims in the county had participated in various sideline productions. In the widespread development of sideline production, the problem of survival for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, workers, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed was also better resolved. The government mobilized them to turn dead assets into funds and organized them with farmers who had labor but no funds to carry out mutual aid production.

After half a year of efforts, under the leadership and assistance of the government, the people of Shou Zhang County have gained experience in overcoming famine with human power, greatly increased their confidence in production for self-relief, and laid a favorable foundation for overcoming the spring famine. At present, the county's leading organs are calling on cadres to make persistent efforts, prevent complacency arising from the achievements in disaster relief, and require cadres in disaster areas to combine disaster relief work with spring farming production on the existing basis, and organize forces to strengthen cooperative work in order to support disaster victims in production in a more planned and organized manner, and further promote disaster relief work.

　　充分利用各界人民代表会议
    寿张县十五万人安渡灾荒
    现正结合春耕生产推进救灾工作
    【新华社新乡十五日电】平原省寿张县重灾区、由于充分利用各界人民代表会议，发动生产自救，已使十五万灾民渡过由水淹而引起的灾荒，并为渡过春荒打下了有利的基础。
    寿张县的灾荒是在去秋黄水暴涨、民埝溃决之后开始的，全县受灾的村庄达三百五十个，淹没土地四十一万四千余亩，灾民有十五万人。水淹以后，该县人民政府立即召开了各界人民代表会议，会上首先集中解决了灾民顾虑最多的民埝溃决问题，稳定了灾民的生产情绪。继而与会代表热烈展开讨论生产自救问题。有的代表在会上介绍了一些典型的生产自救实例。如某代表介绍张富安村一个灾民从水淹后即进行副业生产，两个月内即赚了豆子两石四斗，解决了全家生活问题。因此，部分代表的依赖救济的思想消除了，从而大大提高了生产自救的信心。许多代表并在会上制订了生产自救的计划。
    各界人民代表会议开过后，生产自救运动就在全县范围内开展起来。该县人民政府为适应农村经济分散的特点，即挨门挨户发动群众展开粉坊、纺织等多种多样的小型副业生产；同时并用以工代赈和贷款等办法，组织规模较大的生产，如组织九十八只大船进行黄河航运，组织八百辆小车进行陆运。该县政府与河务局订立合同，组织十个村的灾民进行打蒲包生产，共赚粮两万斤。此外，人民政府又组织了五千人参加复堤工程。该县人民政府还帮助灾民及时解决了副业生产的销路问题，使生产资金加速周转，并及时解决灾民在生产上所遇到的一些困难，因此生产自救运动便在政府的扶持下大大地开展并巩固起来。
    去年十二月，该县又召集了第二次各界人民代表会议。人民政府在这次会上介绍了生产救灾工作的好的典型经验，并批评一些生产救灾工作做得较差的村庄。人民政府在会上又解释了政府保护私有财产和提倡自由借贷的政策，对违反政策，擅自抽动中农土地的干部给以适当处分，并将全部土地归还中农。会后，在代表们的组织和发动下，该县的借贷关系就活跃起来。因此，生产自救运动又有了进一步的开展。如晋城村灾民经过自由借贷后已使参加打蒲包的灾民由六十九户发展到八十二户，参加磨粉的灾民由十一户发展到二十一户。到一月份，全县百分之六十四的灾民都已参加了各种各样的副业生产。在副业生产的普遍开展中，烈、军、工属和老弱孤寡的渡荒问题，也同时得到了较好的解决，政府动员他们以死物变成资金，和有劳力而无资金的农民组织起来，进行互助生产。
    经过半年来的努力，寿张县人民在政府的领导与帮助下，已获得了以人力战胜饥荒的经验，对生产自救的信心大大提高，给渡过春荒打下了有利的基础。目前该县领导机关正号召干部再接再厉，防止因救灾获得成绩而产生的自满思想，要求灾区干部在现有基础上将救灾工作与春耕生产相结合，并组织力量，加强合作社工作，以求更有计划有组织地扶助灾民进行生产，把救灾工作继续向前推进一步。
