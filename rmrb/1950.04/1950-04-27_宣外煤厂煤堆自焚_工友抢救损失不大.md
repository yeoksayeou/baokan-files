　　Xuanwai Coal Plant Coal Pile Spontaneously Combusts; Workers Rescue, Losses Minor
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Xuanwai Coal Plant of the Beijing Coal and Iron Company lacked fire prevention equipment, and a coal pile spontaneous combustion incident occurred. Fortunately, the staff and workers actively rescued the situation, preventing major losses to state property.
    The coal plant stored over 1,400 tons of Xiayuan raw coal, including over 300 tons of old coal (coal transported in around July of last year). At 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month, smoke suddenly emerged from the northwest part of the coal pile. After a worker discovered it, he immediately reported it to the administration. Led by the deputy director, all cadres and workers immediately overturned the pile for rescue, and immediately reported to the company and brother coal plants. Upon hearing the news, the company and brother coal plants rushed to the rescue. All workers and cadres of the Qianmen Coal Plant and branch company staff actively participated in the rescue. Although the Xizhimen Coal Plant and Chaoyangmen Coal Plant were far away, some workers and cadres also brought shovels, baskets, and other tools to help with the rescue. Ninety-nine people demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for protecting state property during the rescue, sparing no effort to be the first to work. The director and deputy director of the plant also carried coal like the coal carrying workers, until the fire was extinguished. Thanks to everyone's efforts, especially the workers, over 700 tons of coal were overturned, and the spread of the fire was finally stopped at 5:30 AM on the 15th. Only three tons of coal were burned, and state property did not suffer major losses. The main reason for the fire was a lack of experience in operating coal, insufficient routine inspections, and the absence of ventilation equipment. In addition to conducting a self-criticism, the company has instructed its subordinates to immediately implement fire prevention equipment, and increase vigilance to avoid similar incidents from happening again.

　　宣外煤厂煤堆自焚  工友抢救损失不大
    【本报讯】北京市煤铁公司宣外煤厂没有防火设备，曾发生煤堆自焚事件。幸赖职工积极抢救，使国家资财免受大的损失。
    该煤厂储存之下花园原煤一、四○○余吨，其中有旧存煤三○○余吨（去年七月间运来之煤），煤堆西北部忽于本月十四日早六时有烟气冒出，为一工友发觉后当即向行政报告，在副厂长带领下全体干部工人马上倒堆抢救，并立刻报告公司及兄弟煤厂、公司及兄弟煤厂闻信随即赶来抢救。前门煤厂全体工人、干部及分公司职工闻息后均主动的参加了抢救。西直门煤厂、朝阳门煤厂虽相距甚远，一部工人干部也携带着铣、筐等赶来协助抢救。九十九人在抢救中表现了高度的爱护国家财产的热情，不惜一切的争先恐后的去干。该厂正副厂长也同抬煤工人一样抬煤，直至把火扑灭。由于大家特别是工友的努力，将煤堆倒开七○○余吨，至十五日早五点半终于停止了火的蔓延，仅烧坏三吨煤，国家资财未遭大的损失。此次起火原因，主要是对经营煤炭缺乏经验，平时检查不够，无有通风设备所致，现该公司除作检讨外，已指示所属着即办理防火设备，并提高警惕，以免类似现象再次发生。
