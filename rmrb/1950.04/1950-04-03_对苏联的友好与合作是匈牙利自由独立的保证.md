　　Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union is the Guarantee of Hungary's Freedom and Independence
　　By Delia Sefu
　　The Hungarian working people have achieved new and great victories in building a people's democratic state. This is clearly shown in the official report recently released by the State Planning Bureau. The report states that Hungarian workers completed the three-year plan for the national economy in two years and five months, with industrial products and minerals exceeding the level expected at the end of the three-year plan by 20 percent. Compared with the pre-war period, industrial production has expanded by more than 40 percent.
　　Hungarian agriculture has also achieved great success. The production level of agricultural products has basically reached the pre-war level according to the three-year plan.
　　As a result of the successful implementation of the three-year plan, the lives of the Hungarian people have been significantly improved and raised. The plan stipulated that the living standards of workers should be increased by 8 percent compared with the pre-war period. In fact, this plan has been exceeded by 30 percent. At the end of 1949, the actual wages of workers exceeded the pre-war level by more than 40 percent. Unemployment has been completely eliminated in the country.
　　Among these victories of the Hungarian people, the fraternal support and selfless help of the Soviet Union have played a significant role. The Soviet Union stood beside the cradle of the Hungarian People's Republic. The Soviet army liberated Hungary from fascist enslavement. The Soviet Union saved the new Hungary from enslavement by Anglo-American imperialists. Relying on the selfless help and support of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, the Hungarian people have implemented profound democratic reforms in the country, ensuring the path of development towards socialism.
　　Comrade Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party, pointed out that the victory of the Soviet people over the fascist beasts was the starting point for the birth of the new Hungary. The help of the Soviet Union enabled the Hungarian people to successfully overcome obstacles along the way. Minister Aire Gili said: "The constant friendship of the Soviet Union, the great Stalin, and the application of the valuable experience of Soviet socialist construction are decisive events that have promoted the revival of the new Hungary and the restoration of the national economy."
　　Brotherly friendship with the Soviet Union is the guarantee of peace and the guarantee of prosperity and independence for the new Hungary and other people's democratic countries. It is precisely for this reason that the Anglo-American imperialists attempted, with the help of the fascist bandit Tito, to split Hungary and other people's democratic countries from the Soviet Union, separating them from the peace and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
　　However, the sabotage plan of the US-British reactionary group and its employed agent, the Tito clique, was crushed. The people of Hungary exposed the American and Tito spies in Hungary. Rakosi said: "Thanks to the Soviet Union, the despicable spies of the American warmongers - the traitor Tito - were not able to turn our motherland into a bloody battlefield." Like the working people of other people's democratic countries, the Hungarian people responded to the international reactionaries' attempts to split Hungary from the democratic and socialist camp by consolidating and strengthening their friendship with the Soviet Union.
　　Between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Hungary, there is a relationship of the closest friendship based on true equality and mutual respect. In the years after the end of the war, the Hungarian people have seen the Soviet Union's love, sincerity, and selfless help more than once. The Soviet Union has given comprehensive assistance to the new Hungary. Based on the economic agreements signed between the two countries, the Soviet Union provided Hungary with the industrial equipment, raw materials, and various commodities it needed. In the difficult years of drought, the Soviet Union gave Hungary grain, seeds, and feed. In various international delegations, the Soviet Union has always unswervingly defended the rights of the Hungarian people. For example, in the United Nations, the US-British monopoly capitalists repeatedly attempted to make Hungary a dependency and colony of Wall Street and the big capitalists of the London financial district by interfering in its internal affairs; only the Soviet Union weakened this attempt by imperialist robbers.
　　The friendly cooperation between Hungary and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of Hungary's freedom and independence.

　　对苏联的友好与合作是匈牙利自由独立的保证
    德拉耶席夫著
    匈牙利的劳动人民在建设人民民主的国家中，获得了新的巨大胜利。这由国家计划局不久以前公布的官方报告中即明白地显示出来了。该报告说，匈牙利的劳动者们在两年零五个月的时间内完成了国民经济三年计划，工业产品及矿产超过三年计划末应有水平之百分之二十。与战前相比起来，工业生产已扩大了百分之四十以上。
    匈牙利的农业方面也达到了巨大的成就。农业产品的生产水平，依照三年计划也基本上达到了战前水平。
    由于三年计划成功地执行的结果，匈牙利人民的生活显著地改善与提高了。计划曾规定劳动者生活水平要较战前提高百分之八。实际上这计划已被超过了百分之三十。一九四九年底，劳动者的实际工资就超过了战前水平百分之四十以上。国内已完全肃清了失业现象。
    在匈牙利人民的这些胜利之中，苏联的兄弟的支持与无私的帮助曾起了很大的作用。苏联站在匈牙利人民共和国摇篮旁边。苏军从法西斯奴役下解放了匈牙利。苏联使新匈牙利免受英美帝国主义者的奴役。匈牙利人民依靠苏联无私的帮助和支持，在匈牙利工人党领导下，在国内实现了深刻的民主改革，保证了步向社会主义的发展道路。
    匈牙利工人党总书记拉科西同志曾指出，苏联人民战胜法西斯野兽的胜利是新匈牙利诞生的起点。苏联的帮助使匈牙利人民能成功地克服了途中的障碍。艾里·吉里部长说道：“苏联的、伟大斯大林的经常友谊的帮助，苏联社会主义建设的宝贵经验的运用，是促使新匈牙利复兴及恢复国民经济的决定性的事件。”
    与苏联的兄弟般的友谊，是和平的保证，是新匈牙利及其他人民民主国家的繁荣与独立的保证。正是因此，英美帝国主义者即企图借法西斯匪帮铁托之助，使匈牙利与其他人民民主国家和苏联分裂开来，使它们离开以苏联为首的和平及社会主义阵营。
    然而美英反动集团及其雇佣代理人铁托集团的破坏计划被粉碎了。匈牙利的人民揭穿了美国、铁托在匈牙利的间谍。拉科西说：“由于苏联，美国战争贩子的卑鄙间谍——叛徒铁托才没有能够使我们祖国变为血腥的战场。”匈牙利人民像其他人民民主国家的劳动人民一样，对于国际反动派企图分裂匈牙利与民主及社会主义阵营的阴谋，用巩固与加强对苏联的友情来回答。
    在苏联及人民民主的匈牙利之间，建立着基于真正平等与互相尊重的最密切的友爱的关系。战争结束后的几年之中，匈牙利人民不只一次地看到了苏联的友爱、真诚和无私的帮助。苏联曾给予新匈牙利全面的帮助。基于两国所签定的经济协定，苏联给匈牙利提供了它所需要的工业设备、原料和各种商品。在旱灾的困难年代，苏联给了匈牙利谷物、种子和饲料。苏联在各种国际代表会中，始终不渝地保卫着匈牙利人民的权利。例如在联合国中，美英独占资本家屡图以干涉内政的方法，使匈牙利成为华尔街与伦敦城区大资本家的附庸与殖民地；只有苏联削弱了帝国主义强盗的这种企图。
    匈牙利与苏联的友好合作，是匈牙利自由与独立的保证。
