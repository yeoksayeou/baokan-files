Passengers Should Pay Attention to Fire Prevention
A Comrade from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Training Class Was Too Careless

To the Editor:

　　On April 6th, the No. 101 train from Beijing to Shenyang had 54 comrades from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Training Class board the train in Fengtai. Between Anding and Yangliuqing, someone from this group threw a cigarette butt under the heating pipe, where there happened to be a small hole. Because the train was moving fast, the cigarette butt was blown by the wind and ignited the wood under the carriage. Comrade Zhang Zhenrong, the accompanying law enforcement police officer, discovered it and extinguished the fire with water, preventing an accident. We hope that passengers will strengthen their sense of responsibility for fire prevention and protect state property in the future.

　　旅客应注意防火
    河北省党委训练班某同志太不小心编辑同志：
    四月六日由北京开往沈阳的一○一次列车，行至丰台，有河北省党委训练班的五十四位同志上车。在安定至杨柳青间，这班同志中，有人把烟头扔在暖气管下，恰好那里有一个小窟窿，车走的快，烟头被风吹着，烧着了车底的木头。押车的执法警张振荣同志发觉后，才用水扑灭，没有发生事故。希今后旅客加强防火责任心，爱护国家财产。
