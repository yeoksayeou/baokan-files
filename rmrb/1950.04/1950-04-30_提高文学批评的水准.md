Raising the Level of Literary Criticism
    Translated by Chen Hanzhang

    Editor's Note: The Soviet journal "October" published in its second issue this year an article by Berik entitled "Some Errors in Literary Studies". This article dogmatically applied passages from Lenin's "On Party Organization and Party Literature", distorted Lenin's principles of literary partisanship, and vulgarized Lenin's ideas on literature and art. Therefore, "Literary Gazette" published an editorial on March 29th entitled "Against Vulgarization in Literary Criticism" criticizing Berik's erroneous viewpoints. Subsequently, "Pravda" also published a special article on the 30th with the same title, sternly pointing out Berik's harmful criticism style and sectarian tendencies resembling those of the RAPP group. The article "Raising the Level of Literary Criticism" presented here today, originally titled "A Reappearance of RAPP-ism (Note)", was published in the "Culture and Life" newspaper, the organ of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on March 31st. The article provides a concise explanation of the Bolshevik Party's literary policy, exposes Berik's dogmatic method of mechanically applying quotations from Lenin's works without regard to historical conditions, and severely criticizes Berik's incorrect ideas on the relationship between Party and non-Party writers, and on the legacy of Russian classical literature, etc. This article is helpful for us to understand and learn genuine Bolshevik Party literary criticism.

    The decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues have greatly enhanced the fighting Party spirit of Soviet writers and promoted the further strengthening and development of Soviet literature. The implementation of these decisions has also further improved the ideological and artistic standards of Soviet literature and art.

    Vigorously developing principled and objective criticism is of paramount importance for further improving Soviet art and literature. At every stage of the development of Soviet literature, the Party has assigned and continues to assign great significance to literary criticism, regarding it as a crucial factor in the ideological and artistic development of literature. Comrade Stalin taught us that criticism and self-criticism are among the serious forces driving our development forward.

    In recent years, many articles have been published in our magazines and newspapers to combat the remnants of lack of ideological content and formalism in literature. The criticism circle has launched an offensive against the bourgeois, decadent culture of Western Europe and its shameless accomplices and followers in our literary studies, properly evaluated the erroneous school of Veselovsky in modern literary studies, and exposed the works of cosmopolitan critics permeated with flattery.

    However, there are also those among literary critics who incorrectly understand the Party's tasks in art and literature, distort the methods of socialist realism in their speeches, create confusion in Soviet literary studies, and hinder the upward development of literature.

    In the second issue of the 1950 "October" magazine, an article by Berik entitled "Some Errors in Literary Studies" was published. This article distorts Lenin's principles on literature, contains erroneous interpretations of the most important issues in the development of modern Soviet literature, and is full of harmful methods of RAPP-style criticism: behind-the-back criticism, unfounded accusations, and sectarian appeals in literature.

    With an impermissible audacity that revives the era of RAPP-style criticism, Berik fiercely attacks the works of Soviet literary scholars, distorts the principles of Soviet literary studies, and obliterates the excellent traditions of Russian literature. The neo-RAPPist Berik attempts to use quotations from the works of Marx, Lenin, and Marxist classics to prove his scholastic deductions. However, Berik does not understand what the principles he cites refer to, under what specific historical conditions they were spoken, and distorts these principles.

    Berik quoted the following principle from Lenin's essay "Party Organization and Party Literature" written in 1905: "Newspapers should become the organs of various party organizations. Literary men must join the party organizations. Publishing houses and libraries, bookstores and reading rooms, and all kinds of businesses dealing with the sale of books – all these should become the party's, under supervision." Berik then wrote: "The Party has been conducting intense and thorough struggles for such literature since the earliest days of its founding, not just after the proletariat won the victory of the October Revolution." According to Berik's statement, it can be concluded that the Party, even after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and up to the present, believes that writers must join the Party organization and become Party members, otherwise they cannot master the method of socialist realism, about which Berik openly proclaims: "Socialist realism is the Party's method of artistic creation." Such an interpretation of Lenin's principle of literary partisanship is erroneous and one-sided.

    Everyone knows that Lenin wrote in his 1905 essay "Party Organization and Party Literature": "Down with non-partisan literary men! Down with superman literary men! Literary work should become part of the overall proletarian cause...". What did this mean under those specific conditions? Lenin exposed the slogan of "non-partisanship" launched by bourgeois political parties, which was particularly promoted by various bourgeois lackeys, including the Constitutional Democrats, who pretended to be non-partisan, clamoring that their party was "not of a class" and that their magazine "could not become partisan," etc. Lenin exposed the hypocrisy of the theory of non-partisanship, explaining that under the conditions of a class-based, antagonistic society, and under the conditions of class struggle, any work by a writer is class-based and partisan, either being used by this camp or by another camp. Comrade Stalin exposed such "non-partisan freaks" in his 1912 article "Non-Partisan Eccentrics". But this was a historical condition at the time. Obviously, under another historical condition, when the socialist system has already achieved victory in our country, it would be wrong to treat non-Party members with any distrust.

    Berik attempts to revive the already defeated Averbach faction in 1950, artificially separating Communist Party writers from non-Party writers, and pitting Party writers against non-Party writers. Of course, such attempts are harmful and foolish. Under the conditions of Soviet society, there are no barriers that can separate Party and non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The Communist Party has always represented and represents the major and fundamental interests of the working people, and it is the leading and guiding force of Soviet society. In our socialist society, the interests of the Party, the state, and the people are integrated into a whole. The policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet state are the foundation of Soviet society's life. All Soviet people, whether Party or non-Party, support this policy. Together, Party and non-Party members, united in a single collective, created and consolidated the Soviet socialist state, built socialist society, defended the great socialist victories in arduous struggles, and are now victoriously building communism.

    Comrade Stalin said in his speech to voters on February 9, 1946: "In the past, Communists treated non-Party members and the unaffiliated with some distrust. This was because various bourgeois groups often used the guise of being non-Party to conceal themselves, as it would be disadvantageous for them to speak to the electorate without wearing a mask. That was the situation in the past. But now it is a different era in our country. Now there is a barrier called the Soviet social system that separates non-Party members from the bourgeoisie. It is also this barrier that unites non-Party members and Communists into a common collective of Soviet people. They live together in a common collective and have fought together to consolidate our power; they have fought and bled together on the battlefield for the freedom and greatness of our motherland; they have worked together and forged our victory over the enemy. The difference between them lies only in the fact that some are in the Party and some are not. But this is a formal difference. The important thing is that both are doing a common cause. Therefore, the alliance between Communists and non-Party members is a natural and extremely important thing."

    Therefore, the Soviet regime fundamentally changed the environment and conditions under which the art and literature of our country are now developing. The Party shows tireless concern for all Soviet writers—both Party and non-Party—alike. Together, under the leadership of the Communist Party (original manuscript incomplete), they created and are creating Soviet literature, together they are fighting against detachment from politics and lack of partisanship, and together they are striving for the further development of Soviet literature – the most advanced literature in the world, which can have no interests other than the interests of the people and the interests of the state. The great thoughts of the Lenin-Stalin Party are the soul of Soviet literature. It is the duty of all Soviet writers to faithfully serve the people, to serve the state, to serve the Party, to improve their artistic skills, and to create new artistic works of high ideological content that enhance our motherland based on the method of socialist realism.

    Berik does not understand all this, because he published some unlearned assertions in the "October" magazine and, without knowing what facts to base them on, actually dared to lecture Soviet writers, literary scholars, and critics.

    Berik's article does not mention the populism of Soviet art. In this article, the author avoids mentioning the task of truthfully reflecting reality in artistic works of socialist realism by using general sentences. For those RAPP-style vulgarizers, the issues of populism and realism do not exist; this is how the newly emerged RAPP-ist Berik treats these issues.

    Berik's arguments on cultural heritage radiate a spirit of sectarianism and RAPP-style nihilism. Everyone knows that RAPP-style vulgarizers, from a vulgar sociological standpoint, once "exposed" the great Russian classical writers as writers of antagonistic class ideas; the RAPP faction denied the connection and inheritance between Soviet literature and the excellent traditions of 19th-century Russian classical literature, and on this issue combined with the Proletkult faction. In essence, what Berik is doing is the same.

    Direct inheritance links Soviet literature with the excellent traditions of Russian literature, and no one can be allowed to infringe upon our great heritage, no matter what sophistry they use, they cannot hide the essence of their RAPP-style nihilism.

    Following in the footsteps of RAPP-style vulgarizers, Berik is dedicated to dogmatically exploring the fundamental differences between socialist realism and critical realism. Those RAPP-style vulgarizers once "studied" Russian literary classics, saying that they had not mastered the methods of dialectical materialism and had not stood on the position of scientific socialism. Of course, socialist realism has principled differences from the realism of past writers. But it would be a great mistake to forget the deep inheritance relationship that exists between classical Russian literature and Soviet literature.

    When discussing the creations of Tolstoy and Chekhov, Berik only sees one aspect, saying "...these writers' understanding of the content and nature of the revolutionary movement led by the socialist proletariat is very far apart, Tolstoy was once a person who opposed scientific, revolutionary socialism, and Chekhov completely did not understand this kind of socialism." However, Berik does not mention the progressive things contained in the creations of these great Russian writers.

    Berik accuses Russian classical literature of having the shortcomings of metaphysical materialism. Berik wrote: "Past realist artists intuitively reflected reality; they criticized reality, but did not find a clear way to transform it." Who is Berik referring to here as those past writers? He lists them – these are "Chernyshevsky, Nekrasov, Dobrolyubov, Pomilovsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and several others." Berik accuses these writers of an intuitive attitude towards life and a cold description of life, and accuses them of criticizing life from the viewpoint of abstract virtues and detached ideals.

    Did Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov and others criticize from the point of view of "abstract virtues"? According to Berik's statement, it can be concluded that "The Precipice", "What Is to Be Done?", Chernyshevsky's essays, Pomilovsky's "Sketches of Seminary Life", Nekrasov's poems, Dobrolyubov's essays, and Shchedrin's satirical works, all these painstaking works that call on the people to struggle are the result of "an intuitive attitude towards life" and "a cold description of life". Berik did not understand the difference between Chernyshevsky's revolutionary democracy and bourgeois liberalism.

    There are other errors and distortions in Berik's article. For example, this unsuccessful critic openly opposes the diversity of forms, styles, and patterns in socialist realism art in a completely RAPP-style spirit, opposing the diversity of creative personality expressions of Soviet writers. Ignoring the beneficial experience of the development of Soviet literature that has created a wide variety of forms and styles, Berik demands that the expression methods and methods "conforming" to the method of socialist realism be prescribed once and for all. Such high-sounding arguments can only be made by hopeless metaphysicians and dogmatists who cannot observe things in their diversity and in their development and change.

    Berik's article is full of stupid errors and harmful RAPP-style views, and is mixed with ignorance, arrogance, and ambition.

    It is truly perplexing how the editorial department of "October" magazine could publish Berik's dangerous article, which carries the harmful RAPP-style viewpoints that have long been defeated and refuted by the Party.

    Our criticism circle must be more active in exposing the decadent bourgeois culture of capitalist countries, and in fighting against the bourgeois aesthetic and formalistic tendencies in literature and art.

    The criticism and book review columns in magazines and newspapers have not yet risen to the level they should be, and have not yet effectively promoted the development of Soviet literature.

    There must be a fundamental change in the attitude towards criticism on the part of the editorial boards of magazines and newspapers and the Soviet Writers' Union. Criticism – this is not the rear of the literary front, but its vanguard. We need principled criticism that can promote the ideological and artistic development of Soviet writers and artists.

    Literary and artistic magazines, writers' unions, and our Bolshevik Party newspapers are tasked with playing a major role in the struggle for a new literary upsurge and for a high level of literary criticism.

    (Note) "RAPP" is the "Russian Association of Proletarian Writers." This union was dissolved on April 23, 1932, by a decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). This group, headed by Averbach, adopted a sectarian closed-door approach to a large number of non-Party writers who turned to socialism, and simply denied the Russian classical literary heritage as antagonistic class ideas. Therefore, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party decided to dissolve this group and organized the current Soviet Writers' Association.

　　提高文学批评的水准
    陈汉章译
    编者按：本年第二号苏联《十月》杂志上登载了别里克的一篇题为《论文艺学中的若干错误》的论文，这篇论文教条主义地搬用了列宁《论党的组织与党的文学》中的章句，曲解了列宁论文学党性的原则，并庸俗化了列宁关于文学和艺术的思想。因此《文学报》在三月二十九日发表了一篇编辑部的论文以《反对文学批评中的庸俗化》为题批判了别里克的错误观点。接着真理报也在三十日发表同一标题的专论，严正地指出了别里克那种拉普派的有害的批评作风和宗派倾向，今日本报所载《提高文学批评的水准》一文，原名《关于拉普（注）派的一次再现》，载于三月三十一日联共（布）中央委员会宣传鼓动部机关报《文化与生活报》上，该文对布尔什维克党的文艺政策作了扼要的阐解，揭发了别里克不顾历史环境的条件机械地搬用列宁著作中的字句的那种教条主义的方法，严厉批评了别里克在党与非党作家的关系问题上以及关于俄罗斯古典文学遗产问题等等方面的不正确思想。这篇论文对于我们了解与学习真正的布尔什维克党的文学批评是有帮助的。
          ★                  ★                  ★
    联共（布）党中央委员会关于意识形态诸问题的决定大大地提高了苏维埃作家的战斗的党的精神，促进了苏维埃文学的进一步加强与发展。这些决定的实现还更加提高了苏维埃文学和艺术的思想和艺术水准。
    竭力发展原则的和客观的批评对进一步提高苏维埃艺术文学是具有非常重要的意义。在苏维埃文学发展的各个阶段上，党曾经赋予而现在还在赋予文学批评以巨大的意义，把它看成在思想上、艺术上来发展文学的一个极重要的因素。斯大林同志教导我们说，批评和自我批评是推进我们发展的严重力量之一。
    在最近几年内，在我国的杂志和报纸上曾刊载了许多用来反对文学中的无思想性和形式主义残余的文章。批评界曾展开了进攻来反对西欧资产阶级的、没落的文化及其在我国文艺学中的无耻的同党和追从者，恰如其份地评价了现代文艺学中的维雪洛夫斯基错误学派，揭露了浸透着阿谀精神的世界主义批评家的作品。
    然而在文学批评家中也还有那样的人，他们不正确地了解党在艺术文学方面的任务，在自己的演说中歪曲社会主义现实主义的方法，使苏维埃文艺学问题产生混乱，妨碍文学的向上发展。
    在一九五○年第二号的《十月》杂志上登载了别里克的一篇论文《论文艺学中的若干错误》。这一篇论文歪曲着列宁论文学的原则，包含着对现代苏维埃文学发展最重要问题的错误解释，充满着拉普派批评的有害方法：背后批评，无根据的非难，进行文学中的宗派号召。
    别里克以复兴早已成为过去的拉普派批评时代的不可容许的放肆态度，猛烈地攻击着苏维埃文艺学家的作品，曲解苏维埃文艺学的原则，抹煞俄罗斯文学家的优良传统。新拉普分子别里克企图引用马克思、列宁主义经典作家作品中的章句来证实自己的繁琐学派的推论。可是别里克并不了解他所引证的原理是对什么说的，是在怎样的具体历史条件下说的，而把这些原理加以歪曲。
    别里克从列宁在一九○五年所写的论文《党的组织与党的文学》中引用了下面的原理：“报纸应该成为各个党组织的机关报。文学家必定要加入到党的组织里去。出版社和书库、书店和阅览室以及各种经营书籍买卖的——所有这些都应该成为党的、受监督的”。往下别里克就写道：“党自其产生的最初几天起，而不只是在无产阶级获得十月革命的胜利后，就为这样的文学进行了而现在还在继续进行着紧张的和彻底的斗争”。按照别里克的说法就可得出结论，仿佛党在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后以至于现在，都在认为作家必定要加入到党的组织里去，变成党里面的人，否则他们就不能够掌握社会主义现实主义的方法，关于这一点别里克公然扬言说：“社会主义现实主义是艺术创作的党的方法”。这样来解释列宁的文学党性的原则是错误的和片面的。
    大家都知道，列宁在一九○五年的《党的组织与党的文学》一文中写过：“打倒无党派性的文学家！打倒超人文学家！文学事业应该是整个无产阶级事业的一部分……”。这在那些具体条件下是表示什么意思呢？列宁曾经揭露了资产阶级政党借以发动的“无党派性”的口号，而这个口号曾经为各种资产阶级的走狗们特别加以宣传过，其中包括立宪民主党在内，他们假装作没有党派，他们叫嚣说，好像他们的党“不是阶级的”，好像他们的杂志“不可能成为党的”等等。列宁揭露了无党性理论的虚伪，说明了在阶级的、对立的社会的条件下，在阶级斗争的条件下，作家的任何作品是有阶级性的，是有党派性的，它或者被这个阵营所利用，或者是被另一个阵营所利用。斯大林同志在一九一二年所写的《无党派的怪人》一文中曾经揭露了诸如此类的“无党派性”。可是这在当时是一种历史条件。显然，在另一种历史条件下，当社会主义制度已经在我们国内取得胜利，如果以任何不信任的态度来对待非党人士这就是错误的。
    别里克企图在一九五○年来复活已经被击溃了的阿维尔巴赫派。人为地把共产党员作家与非党作家隔离开来，使党的作家与非党的作家对立起来。当然，这种企图是有害的和愚蠢的。在苏维埃社会的条件下，是没有能够使党和非党的工人、农民和知识界隔离开来的壁垒。共产党一直是代表了并代表着劳动者的重大的、根本的利益，它是苏维埃社会的领导的和指示方向的力量。在我们社会主义社会里，党、国家、人民的利益是融结成一个整体的。共产党和苏维埃国家的政策是苏维埃社会的生命基础。一切苏维埃人，无论是党的或非党的，都在拥护着这种政策。党和非党的一起，在和他们结成统一的集体中，创立了并巩固了苏维埃社会主义国家，建成了社会主义社会，在顽强的斗争中保卫了伟大的社会主义的胜利成果，而现在正在胜利地建设着共产主义。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日对选民的演说中说：“在从前的时候共产党人对待非党人士和无党无派是有点不信任的。其所以如此是因为各种各样的资产阶级集团往往用无党无派的幌子来遮掩自己，因为他们不戴起假面具来在选举人面前讲话，便是与自己不利的。从前的情形就是这样的。但现在在我国是另外一个时代了。现在有一个叫做苏维埃社会制度的壁垒把非党人士和资产阶级隔开了。也正是这个壁垒又使非党人士和共产党人联合成为一个苏维埃人们的共同的集体。他们在共同的集体中生活着，一同为巩固我国威力而进行了斗争；他们为了我们祖国的自由和伟大，一同在战场上作过战，流过血；他们一同锻炼过并锻炼成了我国对敌人的胜利。他们中间的差别，仅在于有的是在党内而有的是不在党内罢了。但这是一种形式上的差别。重要的是在于两者都干着一种共同的事业。因此共产党人和非党人士的联盟便是一件自然的和极其重要的事情”。
    因此，苏维埃政权是根本改变了现在我国的艺术文学所由发展的环境和条件。党对一切苏维埃作家——党的和非党的都同样地表现着不倦的关心。党（原稿不全）一起在共产党的领导下创造了并正在创造着苏维埃文学，一起进行着反对脱离政治和无党性的斗争，共同为进一步发展苏维埃文学——世界上最先进的文学而奋斗，而这种文学除了人民的利益、国家的利益外，是不可能有别的利益的。列宁、斯大林党的伟大思想是苏维埃文学的灵魂。一切苏维埃作家的职责是要忠诚地服务于人民，服务于国家，服务于党，改进自己的艺术技巧，根据社会主义现实主义的方法创造出增誉我们祖国的新的有高度思想的艺术作品。
    所有这一切别里克是不了解的，因为他在《十月》杂志上发表了一些不学无术的断论，并且不知道根据什么事实就居然教训起苏维埃的作家、文艺学家和批评家来了。
    在别里克的论文里一点也没有说到苏维埃艺术的人民性。作者在这篇论文里用一般的句子来避开说到在社会主义现实主义的艺术作品里真实地反映现实的任务。对于那些拉普派庸俗化分子来说，人民性和现实主义的问题是不存在的；这就是新出现的拉普分子别里克之对待这些问题的态度。
    别里克关于文化遗产的议论是发散着宗派精神和拉普派虚无主义的气息。大家都知道，拉普派庸俗化分子曾经以庸俗的社会学立场，把伟大的俄罗斯古典作家当作敌对阶级思想的作家来“揭露”过；拉普分子否认了苏维埃文学与十九世纪俄罗斯古典文学的优良传统间的联系和继承性，而在这问题上与普罗文化派结合起来。按照本质说来，别里克所做的也是同样的。
    直接的继承性把苏维埃文学与俄罗斯文学的优良传统联系起来，而决不能容许任何人去侵害我国的伟大遗产，他们无论用什么样的诡辩，都掩盖不了自己的拉普派虚无主义的本质。
    别里克追随于拉普派庸俗化分子之后来致力于教条式地探索社会主义现实主义之与批判的现实主义的根本区别，这些拉普派庸俗化分子在当时曾经“研究”过俄罗斯文学古典作家，说他们没有掌握了辩证唯物主义的方法以及没有站在科学社会主义的立场上。当然，社会主义现实主义与过去的作家的现实主义是有原则上的区别的。可是如果忘记了那种存在于古典俄罗斯文学与苏维埃文学间的深深的继承关系，那就是极大的错误。
    别里克在论及托尔斯泰、契诃夫的创作时，只是看到了一方面，他说“……这些作家对于以社会主义无产阶级为首的革命运动的内容和性质的理解是相去极远，托尔斯泰曾经是一个反对科学的、革命的社会主义的人，而契诃夫则对这种社会主义是完全不了解的”。可是，别里克没有说到包含在这些伟大的俄罗斯作家创作中的进步东西。
    别里克非难俄罗斯古典文学具有形而上学唯物主义的缺点。别里克写道：“过去的现实主义艺术家直觉地反映了现实；他对现实加以批判，但没有发现对它加以改造的明确道路”。别里克在这里是指过去的那些作家而言呢？他把他们加以列举——这是“车尔尼雪夫斯基、涅克拉索夫、杜勃洛留波夫、波密洛夫斯基、萨尔蒂可夫·谢德林以及若干其他等人”。别里克责难这些作家对生活的直觉态度和对生活的冷淡的描写，责难他们以抽象的美德和脱离实际的理想的观点来批判生活”。
    难道车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃洛留波夫等人是以“抽象的美德”的观点来进行批判的吗？按照别里克的说法就可以得出结论，《悬崖》、《何为》、车尔尼雪夫斯基的论文、波密洛夫斯基的《教会学校的概况》、涅克拉索夫的诗作、杜勃洛留波夫的论文、谢德林的讽刺作品，所有这些化了心血来写成的、号召人民去进行斗争的作品乃是“对生活的直觉态度”的结果，是“对生活的冷淡描写”。别里克并没有了解在车尔尼雪夫斯基的革命民主主义与资产阶级的自由主义之间的差别。
    在别里克的论文里还存在着其他一些错误和歪曲。例如，这个不成功的批评家用完全是拉普派的精神来公开反对社会主义现实主义艺术中形式、风格、样式的多样性，反对苏维埃作家的创作个性表现的多样性。别里克把那种创造了多种多样的形式与样式的苏维埃文学发展的有益经验弃之不顾，而要求一劳永逸地规定出“符合”于社会主义现实主义方法的表现方式和方法。这样的高论只有那种不能在事物的多样性中并在其发展和变化中来对它们加以观察的无望的形而上学者和教条主义者才能做得出来。
    别里克的论文充满了愚蠢的错误，有害的拉普派见解，在这篇论文里混和着无知、傲慢和奢望。
    真是令人百思不解，《十月》杂志编辑部怎样会发表别里克的这种搬运着早已被党击溃和驳斥了的有害的拉普派观点的危险论文。
    我们的批评界必须要有更大的积极性去揭露资本主义国家的腐朽的资产阶级文化，去和文学和艺术中的资产阶级唯美主义的、形式主义的倾向进行斗争。
    杂志和报纸中的批评和书评栏还没有提高到应有的水准，还没有足够有效地作用于苏维埃文学的发展。
    在各杂志、报纸的编辑委员和苏维埃作家联盟方面之对批评的态度上必须要来一个根本的转变。批评——这不是文学战线的后列，而是它的前锋。我们需要能促进苏维埃作家和艺术家的思想，艺术上发展的原则性的批评。
    文学艺术杂志，作家联盟，我们的布尔什维克党报所负的使命是要在争取新的文学高潮，争取文学批评的高度水准的斗争中起重大的作用。

    （注）“拉普”即“俄罗斯无产阶级作家联盟”。该联盟于一九三二年四月二十三日经联共（布）党中央委员会决议解散。这个团体，以阿维尔巴赫为首，对大批转向社会主义的党外作家采取了宗派主义关门主义的态度，对俄罗斯古典文学遗产亦简单地当作敌对阶级思想加以否定。因此联共中央决定解散了这个团体，组织了现在的苏维埃作家协会。
