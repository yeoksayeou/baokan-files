The mining department students of the National Institute of Technology, led by Professors Chen and Wang from the department, went to Xishan Hot Springs, Hongshankou and other places on the 8th of this month for their first mountain geological survey. Students from the Department of Metallurgy and the Department of Electrical Engineering also visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on the 10th. This visit and geological survey have taken the students a step forward in combining theory with practice. (National Institute of Technology Communications Group)

In order to strengthen biology teaching and save school expenses, Hebei High School, under the leadership of biology teacher Mr. Wang Enduo, has refurbished more than 3,000 old slides accumulated over the past ten years and sold them to various provincial middle schools in Hebei Province. So far, sales are worth about 400 real units. The microtome has also been repaired, and the school will produce slides from the next semester. This is a good way to combine production and learning.

In order to make extracurricular activities conducive to learning, Huiwen Middle School has formulated regulations for extracurricular activities: Every Monday is for subject research groups and teachers to conduct political and professional learning; Tuesday is for school-wide sports activities; Wednesday is for class meetings; Thursday is for homeroom teacher meetings; Friday is for school-wide entertainment activities. Since its implementation, teachers and students have not only felt that the contradiction of one person having to attend several meetings at the same time has been resolved, but also that they can make full preparations in advance, which has reduced the confusion.

    河北高中为了加强生物教学和节省学校开支，由生物教员王恩多先生领导同学将十多年积留下来的旧切片三千余张，加以装璜后售与河北省各省立中学。至今已售出约值四百余折实单位。切片机也已修好，自下学期起将生产切片，这是生产与学习结合的好办法。
