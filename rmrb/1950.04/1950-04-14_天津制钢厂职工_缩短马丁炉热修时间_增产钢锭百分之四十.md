Tianjin Steel Plant Workers
    Shorten Open Hearth Furnace Hot Repair Time, Increasing Steel Ingot Production by Forty Percent
    [By Our Correspondent] After the Tianjin Steel Plant successfully trialed the open hearth furnace hot repair method in January under the guidance of Soviet experts, steel ingot production has increased after workers actively studied technology and the second hot repair time was further shortened. The front wall of the plant's open hearth furnace has a short service life due to its construction and refractory materials, generally requiring repair after only about forty heats. In the past, cold furnace cold repairs were carried out, with each repair delaying production for more than 200 hours, accounting for 30 percent of the total production time. At the beginning of January this year, under the direct guidance of Soviet experts and with the active and enthusiastic efforts of all workers, the first trial of the hot repair method was used to replace the cold repair method. As a result, the total furnace repair time was only 52 hours (Editor's note: The news item "Hot Repair of Open Hearth Furnaces" on page 2 of this newspaper on March 13 stated: "The total repair time is 21 hours," which refers to the time of the repair work. If the time for charging, blowing air, and increasing the degree of heat are included, the production time delayed by the repair should be 52 hours). In late February, the plant carried out a second hot repair, with the total furnace repair time taking only 30 hours. This improvement reduced the production time delayed by furnace repair from 200 hours with the cold repair method to 30 hours, shortening the repair time to only 8 percent of the total production time, increasing steel ingot production by about 40 percent, greatly improving steelmaking efficiency.

### 天津制钢厂职工  缩短马丁炉热修时间  增产钢锭百分之四十

　　天津制钢厂职工
    缩短马丁炉热修时间  增产钢锭百分之四十
    【本报讯】天津制钢厂在苏联专家指导之下，于一月间试行马丁炉热修法成功后，由于职工积极钻研技术，第二次热修时间又进一步缩短，产钢量则相对增加。该厂马丁炉前墙，因为构造及耐火材料关系，使用寿命甚短，一般仅四十炉左右即需修理。以往是冷炉冷修，每次修理，耽误生产在二百小时以上，占全部生产时间的百分之三十。今年一月初，经苏联专家的直接指导，在全体职工积极热情的努力学习下，第一次试用热修法以代替冷修，结果全部修炉时间只用了五十二小时（编者按：本报三月十三日二版“热修马丁炉”新闻中所说：“全部修理时间为二十一小时”，系指修理工程之时间，若将加料、送风及提高度等时间计入，则因修理所耽误的生产时间应为五十二小时）。在二月下旬，该厂又进行了第二次热修，全部修炉时间仅用三十小时。这个改进，使修炉所耽误的生产时间由冷修法的二百小时减到三十小时，使修炉时间缩短到仅占全部生产时间的百分之八，增加钢锭产量约百分之四十，大大的提高了炼钢效率。                                  （重工业部新闻报导组）
