　　People's Bank of Ruicheng and Lucheng Sub-branches
    Timely Issue Spring Agricultural Loans
    Masses Vigorously Repair Canals and Dig Wells to Increase Grain Production
    [This Newspaper Reports] Since mid-March, the Ruicheng Sub-branch of the People's Bank has been issuing loans for agricultural tools, draught animals, and water conservancy to support farmers in spring plowing and increased production. Among these, draught animal loans were issued based on the actual conditions of the county; agricultural tool loans were provided by supporting blacksmiths and carpenters to manufacture agricultural tools to be loaned or sold to farmers. Both types of loans were used for their designated purposes. Water conservancy loans mainly supported the masses in repairing canals for irrigation. For example, Tai'an Village in the county has more than 4,900 mu of land and more than 400 households, but the annual harvest is only enough for half a year's consumption, making the lives of farmers extremely difficult. In order to help the village open canals for irrigation and increase grain production, the bank provided a subsidy of 30 shi of grain; the village's Clear Water Canal project is expected to be completed by the end of April. It is estimated that after completion, it can irrigate more than 380 mu of land, and the summer and autumn seasons can increase grain production by more than 340 shi, and save more than 2,400 workdays in both seasons. Currently, the masses in the village are participating in digging canals with great enthusiasm. As of April 10, the branch has supported the repair of five river canals, purchased 37 waterwheels, repaired 53 earth wells, newly dug 16, and provided 2 breeding animals and a batch of agricultural tools, totaling 63,364 jin of grain in loans. The loan issuing work has now entered the inspection stage.

    [Another Report] The Lucheng Sub-branch of the People's Bank focuses on issuing spring loans. In addition to the agricultural tool loans, which have already issued more than 14,400 jin of grain, organizing the ordering of a large number of agricultural tools to be loaned or sold to cooperative members through supply and marketing cooperatives and temple fairs, in terms of water conservancy loans, it has loaned 30 shi of wheat and 40 shi of rice to the Xiliu Cooperative Enterprise Committee, mainly for repairing a bridge over a water canal. It is estimated that after the project is completed, it can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land, and each mu can increase production by at least 5 dou, which can increase grain production by 500 shi; in addition, the installation of five waterwheels can irrigate another 300 mu of land, which can increase grain production by 120 shi. At present, the higher authorities have sent special personnel to supervise and ensure the completion of the task. In addition, it is unified with the Water Conservancy Section to organize the masses to dig wells. Currently, 22 wells have been dug in Machang, Zhangzhuang, and Nantian Gong in the Fifth District, with a total of more than 4,500 jin of wheat loaned. Each well can irrigate about 40 mu of land, totaling more than 800 mu, which can increase grain production by 350 shi. In addition, 14 waterwheels have been purchased for the 22 wells, and efforts are now being organized to ensure the completion of the spring plowing and production increase plan. (Li Zhixian)

　　人民银行芮城潞城两支行
    及时发放春季农贷
    群众大力修渠打井增产粮食
    【本报讯】人民银行芮城支行自三月中旬起，发放农具、耕畜及水利贷款扶助农民春耕增产。其中耕畜贷款系根据该县实际情况贷出；农具贷款系采取扶植铁、木匠制造农具贷给或卖给农民。二者均做到了专款专用。水利贷款主要在扶助群众修渠浇地。如该县太安村现有土地四千九百余亩，人口四百余户，每年收成仅够半年食用，故农民生活极其困难。银行为扶助该村开渠浇地增产粮食，即贷给粮食三十石补助；该村清水渠工程可于四月底完成。预计完工后可浇地三百八十余亩，夏秋两季可以增产粮食三百四十余石，两季并可省工二千四百余工。现该村群众参加挖渠已形成热潮。截至四月十日止，该行共扶植修河渠五条，购水车三十七辆，修土井五十三眼，新打十六眼，种畜二头及一部农具；计贷粮六万三千三百六十四斤。现出贷工作已进入检查阶段。
