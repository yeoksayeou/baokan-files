(I) Resolutely Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" is an extremely important document. This document requires newspapers and periodicals to attract the broad masses of the people to regularly and systematically supervise our work, pay attention to the shortcomings and errors in our work, and correct them, so that we can continue to move forward. This is a serious step that can greatly promote the democratization of the country and improve the work of party committees and people's governments at all levels. All comrades in the Party should seriously study this document based on the designated materials and implement it resolutely and precisely.

The Communist Party of China has grown stronger through criticism and self-criticism. Party leaders have always used criticism and self-criticism to educate cadres, and many cadres have understood this education of the Party. For example, to use recent examples, after this newspaper exposed the serious damage suffered by the Pangjiabao mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine last year, the Chahar Provincial Party Committee, the Chanan Prefectural Party Committee, the Chahar Provincial People's Government, the Chanan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the subordinate county and city government agencies, Longyan Iron Mine, and other units all made public self-criticisms and proposed specific measures for mine protection work. The North China People's Government also issued a decision on this incident, punishing personnel in relevant departments who condoned or engaged in sabotage, and rewarding personnel who had contributed to mine protection. On March 9th of this year, this newspaper revealed the incident of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Party Committee of Pingyuan Province neglecting grain transportation work last winter, and published an article criticizing it, requesting the main responsible personnel involved in this incident to conduct public self-criticism among the masses and in the newspapers. Subsequently, Chao Zhefu, Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, and Vice Chairmen Jia Xinzhai and Han Zhey, jointly sent a letter to this newspaper on March 15th, announcing the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government's report to the State Council on the self-criticism of the Puyang grain transportation incident. The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also announced its report to the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the same incident. On March 13th, the Northeast Daily published a letter from a reader exposing the Dong'an former Military Industry Department's No. 24 Factory for neglecting national laws and demolishing a building and dozens of houses during relocation. The Northeast People's Supervision Committee immediately conducted an investigation and handling, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to punish the relevant cadres, and the main responsible personnel also made written self-criticisms in the newspapers. On March 25th, the Tianjin Daily revealed that the chairman of the trade union of the Shengxifu Hat Shop infringed on the management and management rights of the capitalists, violated the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and published an article criticizing it, which solved a typical problem of labor-capital disputes in private enterprises in Tianjin, and the industrial and commercial policy was corrected. These examples are enough to show that the responsible comrades of our Party and the People's Government are able to analyze the causes of errors with a serious and responsible attitude, quickly correct the errors, and lead by example to educate Party members and the people.

However, it must be admitted that in order to launch open criticism and self-criticism, profound education is still needed. The old society of China hindered and suppressed criticism, and the long-term war environment also limited criticism in the people's ranks to a certain extent. This situation cannot but affect some Party workers. Some workers lack a correct understanding of criticism, regarding being criticized as "exposing scandals," and accepting criticism as "losing face," believing that once criticized, they lose "prestige" and cannot continue to work. Such workers often reject criticism, especially criticism from newspapers. They often adopt the following methods to deal with criticism from newspapers: one is to ignore it; one is to seize on certain minor points to overturn the entire criticism; one is to directly confront the newspaper, refusing interviews, blocking news, or retaliating against the critic. For example, according to the "Social Service" page of the Henan Daily, from June to December last year, more than 68 percent of the criticisms and suggestions published in the newspaper had no results, and more than 80 percent of the readers' letters forwarded to the party committees and governments for processing were not answered until there was some improvement in March this year. The "Social Service" page of the Jiangxi Daily published a letter from five readers in Yisu Township, the third district of Lichuan County, on February 11 this year, exposing five points of illegal behavior of the work team cadre Zhong Wu. Zhong Wu actually wrote a letter threatening the editorial department, accusing the editorial department of being "the tail of the special agents" (see Jiangxi Daily on February 11 and 24). Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of Communist Party and People's Government workers refusing newspaper criticism.

The existence of this phenomenon is extremely harmful to the Party, the people, and the country, because this phenomenon itself is bureaucracy. It can only have one effect, which is to separate us from the masses, to enlarge the shortcomings and errors in our work, and to damage our work, which is intolerable to the Communist Party and the People's Government. We must resolutely fight against this bureaucracy, which is seriously poisoning us. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated in this decision: "If the person being criticized refuses to express their attitude, or retaliates against the critic, the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee shall handle it. If the above-mentioned circumstances violate the administrative discipline laws, the national supervisory and judicial organs shall handle it." This is absolutely necessary.

Only the supervision of the masses of the people and the criticism of our shortcomings and errors by the masses of the people in newspapers and periodicals can guarantee the regular contact between our staff and the masses, and can guarantee that our staff will always maintain a Bolshevik, loyal, and enterprising attitude for the cause of the people to engage in their work, and improve their work at any time. We believe that after the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is implemented throughout the Party, the broad masses of the people will actively and enthusiastically participate in the national construction cause, so that the political life of the whole country will be renewed with the addition of unlimited driving force.

### （一）坚决展开批评与自我批评

　　（一）坚决展开批评与自我批评
    中国共产党中央委员会《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定》是一个极其重要的文件。这个文件要求报纸刊物吸引广大人民群众经常地有系统地监督我们的工作，注视我们工作中的缺点和错误，并加以改正，使我们能够继续不断地向前进步。这是一个足以大大促进国家民主化、改善各级党委和人民政府工作的严重的步骤。全党同志应当根据指定的资料，认真进行对于这个文件的学习，并加以坚决的确切的执行。
    中国共产党是从批评和自我批评中壮大起来的。党的领导者从来是用批评和自我批评的方法来教育干部，而很多干部也领会了党的这种教育。比如，用最近的例子来说，去年宣化龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场遭受严重破坏事件，经本报揭发以后，察哈尔省委、察南地委、察哈尔省人民政府和察南专署及所属各县市政府机关、龙烟铁矿等单位就都作了公开的检讨，提出了护矿工作的具体办法。华北人民政府也发布了关于这一事件的决定，处分了纵容或从事破坏的有关部门的人员，并奖励了护矿有功人员。今年三月九日本报揭露去年冬季平原省濮阳专署与地委忽视运粮工作事件，并著论批评，要求这次事件主要有关的负责人员在群众中、在报纸上公开进行自我批评以后，平原省人民政府主席晁哲甫、副主席贾心斋、韩哲一即在三月十五日联名致函本报，公布平原省人民政府向政务院所作的关于濮阳运粮事件的检讨报告，中共平原省委也公布了关于同一事件给中共中央华北局的检讨报告。三月十三日东北日报发表读者来信揭发东安原军工部二十四厂玩忽国家法令，迁移时拆毁大楼一座及平房数十间事件，东北人民监察委员会立即进行了调查处理，中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会作了处分有关干部的决定，主要有关人员也在纸报上作了书面检讨。三月二十五日天津日报揭载盛锡福帽庄工会主任侵犯资方经营权和管理权，违反劳资两利政策，并著论批评，解决了天津私营企业中劳资纠纷的一个典型问题，工商政策为之端正。这些事例，足以说明我们党的和人民政府的负责同志是能够以严肃认真的态度，分析造成错误的原因，迅速改正错误，并以身作则，教育党员和人民的。
    但是，应当承认，为了展开公开的批评和自我批评，仍然需要进行深刻的教育。中国的旧社会是妨害和压制批评的，长期的战争环境也曾使人民队伍中的批评受到一定的限制，这种情况当然不能不影响到一部分党的工作人员。有些工作人员对批评缺乏正确的认识，把被批评看作“揭了丑事”，把接受批评看作“丢面子”，以为一被批评，就失了“威信”，不能继续工作。这样的工作人员常常拒绝批评，特别是拒绝报纸的批评。他们对待报纸的批评往往采取这样几种办法：一种是不理会；一种是抓住某些小节，推翻全部批评；一种是与报社直接对立，拒绝采访，封锁消息，或者向批评者施行报复。例如，据河南日报《社会服务》版统计，从去年六月到十二月，在该报刊出的批评与建议没有结果的占百分之六十八以上，转送各地党委和政府处理的读者来信，没有答复的占百分之八十以上，直到今年三月才有了一些改进。江西日报《社会服务》版在今年二月十一日发表临川县第三区易俗乡读者五人来信，揭发工作组干部钟舞不法行为五点，钟舞竟写信恐吓编辑部，指责编辑部做了“特务的尾巴”（见二月十一日和二十四日江西日报）。很可惜，这些并不是共产党的和人民政府的工作人员拒绝报纸批评的仅有的例子。
    这种现象的存在是对党、对人民和国家极端有害的，因为这种现象本身就是官僚主义。它只能有一个作用，这就是使我们和群众脱离，使我们工作中的缺点和错误扩大，使工作受到损失，而这是共产党和人民政府所不能容忍的。我们必须坚决和这种严重地毒害着我们的官僚主义作斗争。中共中央在这次决定中规定：“如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理。上述情事触犯行政纪律法律的部分，应由国家监察机关司法机关予以处理。”这是完全必要的。
    只有人民群众的监督、人民群众在报纸刊物上对我们的缺点和错误的批评，才能保证我们的工作人员的和群众的经常的联系，才能保证我们的工作人员永远抱着布尔塞维克的、忠诚的、为人民的事业而奋发有为的态度来从事自己的工作，并随时改进自己的工作。我们相信，在中共中央的决定在全党实施以后，广大的人民群众将积极地踊跃地参与国家建设事业，使全国的政治生活中因增加了无限的推进的力量而面貌一新。
