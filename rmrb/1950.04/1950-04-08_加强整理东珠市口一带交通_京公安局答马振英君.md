Mr. Ma Zhenying:

　　Strengthening Traffic Management in the Dongzhushikou Area
    Beijing Public Security Bureau's Response to Mr. Ma Zhenying

    To the Editor:
    Every day I pass through Dongzhushikou, Sanlihe, and Dongliushujing areas and see an unusually large number of pedicabs, rickshaws, and handcarts parked on both sides of the road. The center of the road is supposed to be the fast lane for cars and trams, but now all kinds of slow vehicles are using it. These streets are already not wide, and now, in front of the North China Yarn and Cloth Company in Sanlihe Road, many merchants buying and selling cloth gather every day, making it very inconvenient for pedestrians and very prone to traffic accidents. Please inform the relevant authorities to bring this to their attention.
                     Ma Zhenying

Mr. Ma Zhenying:
    Regarding your concerns, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau replies as follows:

    Mr. Ma Zhenying's opinions on the traffic order in the Sanlihe area are very correct. The Dongzhushikou, Sanlihe, and Dongliushujing areas are major arteries connecting the east and west of the outer city, with heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic. However, the road surface is narrower than general streets, causing considerable inconvenience to pedestrians and vehicles passing through. In the future, we will strengthen the management of traffic order in that area.

　　加强整理东珠市口一带交通
    京公安局答马振英君编者同志：
    我每天经过东珠市口、三里河、东柳树井一带，看见马路两边停放三轮车、人力车、手车特别多。马路中心本是行驶汽车、电车的快车道，现在各种慢车全在此道上走。这些街道本来就不宽，现在三里河路北花纱布公司门前，每天聚有许多买卖布匹商人，行人往来很不方便，并且很容易发生车祸。请转告有关当局，以提起他们的注意。           
                     马振英马振英君：
    你的问题，经北京人民政府公安局答复如下：
    马振英君对于三里河一带之交通秩序的意见很正确。关于东珠市口、三里河、东柳树井一带系贯通外城东西交通之主要干线，行人车马繁多，交通量大，但是路面却较一般街道狭窄，以致形成行人及车辆经此甚感不便。今后我们当加强整理该处之交通秩序。    编者
