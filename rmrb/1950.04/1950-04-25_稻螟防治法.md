Rice Stem Borer Prevention and Control Methods
Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Protection Bureau

　　The rice stem borer is a serious pest of rice in the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions, generally known as the "heart-borer" because it bores into the heart of seedlings and rice stalks, causing the seedlings to wither and the rice to turn into empty white heads when it flowers. This results in a yield loss of at least 10% annually, and in severe years, a reduction of half the yield. It is indeed the only widespread and major pest of rice.

　　There are three types: the striped stem borer, the yellow stem borer, and the dark-headed stem borer. Among them, the dark-headed stem borer causes minor damage, while the striped stem borer and the yellow stem borer are more serious. Their habits are generally similar with minor differences. The adults are small white moths. However, the striped stem borer moth has a small black spot on its wings, and the larvae are light yellowish-green. The yellow stem borer larvae are grayish-yellow with five purplish-brown straight lines on their backs. The striped stem borer lays eggs on the surface or back of rice leaves in oval-shaped masses covered with brownish-yellow fluff. The yellow stem borer lays eggs on the leaf sheath or leaf blade, arranged in a fish-scale pattern, without fluff on the masses. Their occurrence period varies greatly due to climate. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the striped stem borer occurs three times a year, and the yellow stem borer occurs twice. However, in Guangdong, Fujian, and parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, where the weather is warm, the stem borers occur more than three or two times. In areas north of Shandong, where temperatures often reach around -3.5 degrees Celsius in January and February, the striped stem borer cannot survive, so the rice-growing areas of North China are not affected by it. The following is a description of the periods when they appear, according to the agricultural calendar, taking the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei as examples, for reference in prevention and control:

　　Beginning of Summer: Striped stem borer moths, eggs.
　　Grain Full: Striped stem borer moths, eggs, larvae.
　　Grain in Ear: Yellow stem borer moths, eggs, larvae, and some striped stem borer larvae.
　　Summer Solstice: Second generation of striped stem borer moths, eggs, larvae.
　　Minor Heat: Striped stem borer larvae and some yellow stem borer larvae.
　　Major Heat: Second generation of yellow stem borer moths, eggs, larvae, and some striped stem borer larvae.
　　Beginning of Autumn: Yellow stem borer eggs, larvae, third generation of striped stem borer moths, eggs, larvae.
　　Limit of Heat: Striped stem borer eggs, larvae, yellow stem borer larvae.
　　White Dew: Striped stem borer and yellow stem borer larvae (striped stem borer larvae overwinter in the rice roots, yellow stem borer larvae hide in the rice stalks or roots to overwinter, and pupate into moths the following year).

　　Striped stem borer moths and yellow stem borer moths hide in the leaf clusters or dark places during the day and fly out to mate and lay eggs after dusk. After about five to ten days, the larvae hatch, spin silk to hang down, and drift with the wind to nearby rice seedlings. They bore into the plants from the leaf axils, leaf sheaths, or tender stems. Yellow stem borers are gregarious, and there are often more than one in a single plant. When food is insufficient, they will migrate to neighboring plants. Therefore, a few days after the appearance of stem borer moths, withered seedlings are found in the rice fields. The last occurrence is just at the time of heading or flowering. Once affected, the rice cannot head, or only half of it heads, or it heads but cannot bear fruit, resulting in empty white heads. The saying "seedlings but no ears, ears but no grain" accurately describes the actual situation of stem borer damage.

　　Prevention and Control Methods:

　　(1) Treating Rice Roots: Since the stem borer larvae overwinter in the rice roots, after the autumn harvest, the masses should be mobilized to dig up the rice roots, dry them in the sun, remove the mud, and use them as fuel, or burn them with weeds to make ash fertilizer for the fields. They can also be piled with livestock manure and river mud to make compost (rice roots should be placed in the middle and lower layers). In fields where winter crops are planted, it is essential to plow deeply before sowing, taking care to bury the rice roots in the soil and to pick up and burn any rice roots that are exposed or partially exposed on the surface to eliminate the overwintering nests of the stem borers.

　　(2) Treating Rice Straw: Some yellow stem borers overwinter in the late rice stalks, so it is best to burn the rice stalks we have stored before the Qingming Festival. If they cannot be burned on schedule due to fuel or feed reasons, the late rice stalks should be piled separately from the early rice stalks. The early rice stalks should be used to weave straw mats, which should be tightly wrapped around the late rice straw piles and on top. After the Grain Rain, remove the straw mats every six or seven days, and catch the stem borers to feed the chickens, or trample them to death.

　　(3) Collecting Eggs in Seedling Beds: Old-style seedling beds are whole pieces, without paths, which is very inconvenient for collecting eggs. Therefore, new-style seedling beds should be made. The method is to divide the seedling bed into blocks, each four feet wide, so that the egg masses in the middle can be reached from any side. The length is not fixed. Leave a path one and a half feet wide between each block, so that people can squat in the path to search for egg masses. Egg collection should be done in the early morning or evening, and the search should be done against the sunlight, focusing on one side at a time. After one side is finished, move on to the next. When the seedlings are tall, use a thin bamboo pole to turn the leaves, which will make it easier to find the egg masses. The collected egg masses should be destroyed immediately and not discarded randomly. According to the above method, collect eggs every three days to prevent the larvae from hatching and causing damage.

　　(4) Protecting Frogs: In the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, there is a custom of eating frogs, but frogs are beneficial animals that eat stem borer moths and other pests in the fields. It is necessary to widely publicize and persuade those who catch and eat frogs, and everyone should work together to protect them.

　　(5) Inserting Tobacco Stems: This is a local method in Zhejiang, which has been tested for many years and is practiced in many places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other regions. This method not only reduces stem borer damage but also promotes the growth of rice seedlings. In areas where materials are readily available, select thick and fresh tobacco stems, diagonally cut them into small segments two to three inches long, and insert them obliquely near the rice roots between Major Heat and Beginning of Autumn, making sure the tobacco stems do not protrude above the water surface. After insertion, the field should be flooded with water one to two inches deep for the first half-month, as this is most suitable.

　　(6) Collecting Third-Generation Egg Masses: The third-generation egg masses of the striped stem borer (which are concentrated in the medium and late rice fields in Sichuan) are the most numerous, and the larvae that hatch from them mostly damage the rice during the heading and flowering period. Once damaged, this directly affects grain filling and reduces yield. Vigorous organization is needed to universally mobilize the masses to search row by row in the fields every three days, collecting and destroying the eggs.

　　Rice is the main food crop in our country. Crop rotation, fertilization, and intensive cultivation are certainly important, but without eliminating stem borers, it is still not enough to guarantee production. To eliminate stem borers, it is necessary to timely and universally carry out work in accordance with their occurrence patterns. It should not be done by just one person, but by everyone; not just by one family, but by every family; and it must be done thoroughly in order to achieve the goal of guaranteeing production.

　　稻螟防治法
    中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治局
    螟虫在华东、中南、西南三大区内是一种为害水稻最严重的害虫，一般叫做钻心虫，因它钻食苗心和稻秆，所以苗变枯心苗，而在抽穗时就成白穗，每年产量因此损失至少一成，严重年份要减收一半。它确是水稻唯一普遍性的大害虫。
    它的种类有三化螟、二化螟、和大螟三种。其中大螟为害轻微，三化螟和二化螟比较严重，它们的生活习惯，一般是大同小异。成虫是一种小白蛾，不过三化螟蛾的翅膀上多一个小黑点，幼虫淡黄绿色。二化螟幼虫灰黄色，背上有五条紫褐色直线，三化螟产卵在稻叶的表面或背面，成椭圆形的卵块，上盖棕黄色茸毛。二化螟产卵在叶鞘或叶片上面，排列成鱼鳞状，块上没有茸毛。它们发生的时期，因受气候影响，很不一律，在长江下游各省，三化螟一年发生三次，二化螟发生两次，但在广东、福建和江苏、浙江、江西、四川的部分地区，天气暖热，螟虫就不止发生三次或二次。山东以北地区，在一二月间气温常在零下三度半左右，三化螟不能生存，所以华北稻区就不受三化螟的为害。现以江苏、浙江、安徽、湖南、湖北五省为例，把它们出现的时期，依照农节次序，介绍在下面，以供防治时参考：
    立夏  三化螟蛾、卵。
    小满  三化螟蛾、卵、幼虫。
    芒种  二化螟蛾、卵、幼虫、和三化螟部分幼虫。
    夏至  三化螟第二次蛾、卵、幼虫。
    小暑  三化螟幼虫和二化螟部分幼虫。
    大暑  二化螟第二次蛾、卵、幼虫、和三化螟部分幼虫。
    立秋  二化螟卵、幼虫、三化螟第三次蛾、卵、幼虫。
    处暑  三化螟卵、幼虫、二化螟幼虫。
    白露  三化螟和二化螟的幼虫（三化螟幼虫在稻根里过冬，二化螟幼虫躲在稻秆或稻根里过冬，来年变蛹化蛾）。
    三化螟蛾和二化螟蛾在白天都躲在叶丛里或阴暗的地方，黄昏后飞出配对产卵，约经五天到十天孵出幼虫，吐丝下垂，随风飘到附近禾苗上，从叶腋、叶鞘、或嫩茎钻入为害。二化螟有群居性，一株内常不止一头。食料不足时，它们会迁害邻株，所以在螟蛾出现后不多几天，稻田里就发现一批枯心苗，最后发生的一次，恰在将要抽穗或抽穗时期，一经受害，便不能抽穗，或仅抽出一半，或抽出后不能结实成为白穗，所谓“苗而不秀，秀而不实”的一句话，正是描写螟害的实际情况。
    防治方法：
    （一）处理稻根：由于螟虫的幼虫是躲在稻根里过冬的，所以在秋收以后，应发动群众普遍的把稻根掘起，晒干去泥，充做燃料，或和杂草烧灰肥田，也可与畜粪和河泥压堆肥（稻根放在中下层）。在种冬季作物的田里，务必深耕后再行播种，耕时要注意把稻根埋到土内，并须把露出土面或半露出土面的稻根拾起烧掉，消灭螟虫过冬的巢穴。
    （二）处理稻草：部分二化螟虫是在晚稻秆里过冬，所以我们留存的稻秆最好在清明前把它烧掉，如因燃料或饲料关系，不能如期烧掉，可将晚稻秆和早秆稻分开堆存。并用早稻秆编成藁荐，严密的围在晚稻草堆的四周和堆顶，谷雨以后，每隔六七天除去藁荐，把螟虫捉下来喂鸡，或用脚踏死它。
    （三）秧田采卵：旧式秧田是整片的，不留走道，对于采卵很不方便，所以要改做新式秧田，它的做法，是把秧田分做一块一块的，每块四尺阔，便于在任何一面都可伸手采到中部的卵块。长短不拘，每块间留一尺半宽的走道，以便蹲在走道内搜寻卵块。采卵时间应在清早或傍晚，并要反向日光搜寻，认定一方去采，采完这方，再采那方。在秧苗高的时候，用一根细竹竿翻拨秧叶，就容易找到卵块。采到的卵块随即把它消灭，不要乱丢。照上述办法，每隔三天采一次，以免孵化幼虫为害。
    （四）保护青蛙：在长江流域和珠江流域一带，有喜吃青蛙的习惯，但青蛙是吃螟蛾和田内其他害虫的有益动物，必须普遍宣传和说服捕蛙、吃蛙的人，大家一齐起来保护它。
    （五）插植烟茎：这是浙江的土法，经过多年考验，在江苏、浙江、江西等地，很多实行，此法不仅减少螟害，且有促进禾苗的生长作用，在取材便利的地区，可选粗大而新鲜的烟茎，斜切成二三寸长的小段，在大暑立秋间斜插在稻根附近，不使烟茎露出水面，插后半个月内，田里蓄水以一二寸深为最适合。
    （六）采摘第三次卵块：三化螟第三次卵块（在四川集中在中晚稻田内产卵），数量最多，孵化出来的幼虫。多在水稻抽穗开花时期。一经加害，直接影响结实，就减少了产量，应大力组织，普遍发动群众，每隔三天在田里逐行搜寻，采摘销毁。
    大米是我国主要粮食，换种、施肥、和精耕细作，固然重要，但螟虫不除，仍不足以保证生产，要消灭螟虫，必须按照它的发生规律，及时的普遍的展开工作，不仅一人做，要各个人做，不仅一家做，要各家皆做，并且要做得彻底，才能达到保证生产的目的。
