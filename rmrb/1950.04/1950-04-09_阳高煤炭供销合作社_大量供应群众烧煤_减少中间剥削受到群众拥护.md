[Report from this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily on March 28th: The Yanggao County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has organized a coal supply and marketing cooperative to supply the masses with inexpensive coal in large quantities, winning the support of the masses. The number of members and capital has increased by one and a half times, and expansion is now being planned. In the past, the people of Yanggao relied entirely on buying charcoal from coal vendors, who sometimes exploited them for more than half the original price. Due to inconvenient rural transportation, the price of coal was even higher. Buying charcoal from coal merchants meant buying at least 150 jin of large lumps (to avoid breakage and loss of coal dust), which most people could not afford. The masses urgently demanded a solution to the coal problem. In July of last year, the Yanggao Supply and Marketing Cooperative expanded the coal supply and marketing cooperative on Jindao Street in the city into a district cooperative. It obtained a loan of 300,000 yuan from the bank and mobilized the masses in villages near the county seat to buy shares to expand capital. From the beginning, it absorbed more than 2,000 members, raising a total of 10,000 jin of rice. The cooperative also worked hard to accelerate turnover to ensure the supply of charcoal to the masses, adhering to the principle of small profits and quick sales, with relatively low prices. For example, private merchants sold coal for 14 yuan per jin, while the cooperative sold it to non-members for only 12.5 yuan per jin. The masses were very satisfied and actively requested to buy shares. In January of this year, the cooperative, based on economic conditions, stipulated that coal would only be sold to members. This not only eliminated the speculative behavior of a few non-members buying cheaply from the cooperative and selling at high prices, but also motivated some non-members who "disliked the lack of freedom in buying shares" to actively buy shares. To take care of the low purchasing power of the masses, it was stipulated that each member could buy up to 100 jin of coal per month at any time, which was well received by the members. The cooperative's business is now extremely prosperous, with a total of more than 5,000 members. From July of last year to now, it has sold more than 17,700 tons of charcoal, with an average daily sale of 50,000 jin in winter, providing members with sufficient fuel and reducing the heavy exploitation by coal merchants. After March of this year, the county cooperative believed that the cooperative had the conditions to supply fuel to the masses of the entire county and decided to change the cooperative to the Yanggao County Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative. However, because there are now very few rural members, and the masses in some villages still do not know or understand the benefits of the cooperative, the county supply and marketing cooperative is working with cadres going to the countryside from various departments to conduct extensive publicity and absorb a large number of rural members. It also plans to sell charcoal to rural members through district cooperatives, greatly facilitating the people's access to fuel.

### 阳高煤炭供销合作社  大量供应群众烧煤  减少中间剥削受到群众拥护

　　阳高煤炭供销合作社
    大量供应群众烧煤
    减少中间剥削受到群众拥护
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报三月二十八日讯：阳高县供销社组织煤炭供销社，大量廉价供应群众烧煤，得到群众拥护，社员与资金增加一倍半，现正计划扩展中。阳高群众的烧炭过去完全靠向煤贩子购买，中间剥削有时竟超过原价二分之一以上。乡村交通不便，煤价更高。向煤商买炭，起码得买一百五十斤的大块（怕碰碎损耗煤渣）大部群众买不起。群众迫切要求解决煤炭问题。阳高供销社，于去年七月便把城内金道街的煤炭供销社扩大为区社。由银行贷款三十万元，并动员县城附近各村群众入股扩大资金。一开始，即吸收了二千多个社员，共集米一万斤。该社并努力加速周转以保证群众烧炭的供给，煤价掌握薄利多销原则，价格较低。如私商每斤煤卖价十四元，该社售给非社员时卖价每斤才十二元五，群众感到很满意，纷纷要求入股。今年一月，该社又根据经济条件，规定只卖给社员煤炭。这不但杜绝了少数非社员从社内贱价买、高价卖的投机行为，也刺激了一部分“嫌入股不自由”的非社员主动入起股来。为照顾群众购买力低的情况，规定每个社员每月在一百斤煤的范围内可以随时购买，颇受社员拥护。现该社营业极为繁盛，共拥有社员五千多人。从去年七月到现在已售出炭一万七千七百余吨，冬季每天平均出售达五万斤，供给了社员足够的燃料，减少了煤商苛重的剥削。今年三月后，县社认为该社已具有供给全县群众燃料的条件，决定把该社改为阳高县煤炭供销社。但因现在农村社员很少，有些村的群众还不知道或不了解该社的好处。县供销社正配合各部门下乡干部作广泛宣传，大量吸收农村社员。并计划通过区社售炭给乡村社员，给群众烧炭以很大方便。
