North China Provinces Formulate Plans and Actively Prepare for Water Conservancy Construction

[This newspaper dispatch] North China provinces, based on the guidelines and tasks of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, have specifically formulated water conservancy plans for 1950 and are now actively preparing for water conservancy construction.

            Hebei

Hebei Province's river flood control and water conservancy projects for 1950 plan to mainly rectify and dredge the dikes and river courses of the five major river systems, including the Jiyun and Yongding Rivers. In order to build farmland water conservancy and expand paddy fields by 1.5 million mu, it is planned to open five new canals, including Jinmen and Jincang, and renovate existing canals in western and southern Hebei, and vigorously organize farmers to jointly dig wells and buy waterwheels. It is planned to dig 50,000 new brick wells, promote 73,000 waterwheels, and repair 25,000 old wells and 15,000 waterwheels. Currently, the province has established water conservancy promotion agencies at all levels, and supports more than 380 public and private waterwheel factories and more than 480 brick kilns that have started work, organized more than 2,200 well-digging teams and mutual aid groups, and more than 36,000 farmers' households to jointly borrow and buy waterwheels. In order to ensure the quality of waterwheels and deliver goods and payments on time, the water conservancy promotion agency has also signed contracts with brick kilns and waterwheel factories. In addition, the province's Renhe and Rongzhen canals have begun construction.

            Chahar

Chahar Province plans to develop 1.58 million mu of farmland water conservancy this year. According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, it is planned to renovate the three major projects of the Sanggan River, Guangji Canal, and Yang River. In addition to flood control, it can also increase paddy fields by 1 million mu. In addition, the local government will renovate five canals, including Huiwei and Yumin, and organize the masses in southern Chahar and northern Yanbei to develop small-scale water conservancy, which can increase paddy fields by 500,000 mu; digging wells, installing waterwheels, and depositing silt to protect beaches can increase paddy fields by 80,000 mu. The people's governments of various counties have publicized the policies of encouraging water conservancy construction to the masses, and have specifically solved the problems of canal construction burdens and land occupation by canals, and formulated regulations for the use of water conservancy. Currently, one-third of the construction materials for the Sanggan River have been prepared. The survey of various river and canal projects has been completed, and preparations are being made for material preparation and construction. According to statistics from twelve counties, including Hunyuan and Huai'an, more than 3,200 canals and more than 30 dikes have been surveyed by early February. In order to encourage and support the masses in developing water conservancy, the Chahar Southern Special Prefecture lent out more than 468,000 jin of millet, which has now been distributed to various counties. At present, the masses in various counties in southern Chahar have a very high enthusiasm for water conservancy construction, and many projects are ready for construction. Xuanhua County in southern Chahar has completed the topographic survey of 60 li of the river course of the Shalingzi and Xinzhuangzi sections of the Yang River. In order to complete the task of digging 1,500 wells and installing 2,000 waterwheels in the province, the Chahar Provincial People's Government established a water conservancy promotion agency in early January to order and promote waterwheels. Recently, the agency selected and transported a large number of tubular and bucket-type small waterwheels from Hebei Province and distributed them to Yanbei, southern Chahar and other places for trial promotion, which was very popular among farmers.

            Pingyuan

In Pingyuan Province, in addition to the Yellow River being governed by the Yellow River Affairs Bureau of the province, the province has determined that drainage and damming are the focus, and water disasters should be eliminated as soon as possible, combined with the development of water conservancy. South of the Yellow River, flood control is the main focus. We will actively repair the dikes of West Lake and Nanyang Lake, strive to prevent most areas from being flooded, and pay attention to timely drainage of depressions to prepare for spring planting of dried land. North of the Yellow River, water conservancy construction is the main focus. We will renovate more than 20 canals, including Wanjin and Xingfu, to increase paddy fields by 450,000 mu. The water conservancy bureau's survey team of the province, in coordination with the survey team of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, went to the rivers and lakes under the jurisdiction of Anyang, Xinxiang and Heze special districts in January to conduct survey and design work. Since the start of the water conservancy project in Wenxian County, six rivers including Guangji and Changji have been dredged.

            Shanxi

Shanxi Province's policy on water conservancy construction is determined to focus on irrigation and pay attention to flood control. In terms of irrigation, we will vigorously carry out canal construction, dam construction, and excavation of various water wells, which can increase paddy fields by 700,000 mu. Flood control mainly focuses on drainage in low-lying areas of the plains and river channel construction. In order to complete the above tasks, the province proposed to organize the masses well, adopt the opinions of the masses, and learn from the masses.

            Suiyuan

Suiyuan Province will focus on developing farmland water conservancy this year to meet the requirements of increased production. For this reason, in addition to continuing to build the Hetao water conservancy project, it is also preparing to excavate a total of 94 large and small canals, so that more than 18,100 qing of farmland can be irrigated. At present, the province has begun to build canals and dams.

　　华北各省订出计划积极准备水利施工
    【本报讯】华北各省根据中央人民政府水利部的方针与任务，具体规定了一九五○年的水利计划，现正积极进行水利施工的准备工作。
            河北
    河北省一九五○年的河防水利工程，计划主要整顿与疏浚蓟运、永定等五大河系的堤防和河道。为了兴修农田水利扩大水田一百五十万亩、计划增开金门、津沧等五道新渠，整修冀西、冀南地区旧有各渠，大力组织农民合伙打井、买水车。计划增凿新砖井五万眼，推广水车七万三千辆，并修理旧井二万五千眼，水车一万五千辆。现该省建立了各级水利推行社，并扶持公、私营水车工厂三百八十余家、砖窑四百八十余座开了工，组织起打井班、打井互助组二千二百余个，及三万六千余户农民合伙贷、买水车。为保证水车质量及按时交货交款，水利推进社并和砖窑与水车工厂订立了合同。此外，该省修任河，荣臻两渠已开始动工。
            察哈尔
    察哈尔省今年计划开发一百五十八万亩的农田水利。根据中央人民政府水利部的方针，计划整修桑乾河、广济渠、洋河等三大工程，除防洪外，并可增加水田一百万亩。另外由地方整修惠蔚、裕民等五渠及在察南、雁北组织群众开发小型水利，共可增水田五十万亩；凿井、安水车、放淤保滩，共可增水田八万亩。各县人民政府将奖励兴修水利政策向群众进行了宣传，并具体解决了渠工负担及渠占地问题，订立了使用水利规章。现桑乾河修建材料已准备齐三分之一。各河、渠工程已勘测完毕，正在备料开工。据浑源、怀安等十二县统计，二月初即已勘测水渠三千二百余道，堤坝三十余道。察南专署为鼓励和扶助群众开发水利，曾贷出四十六万八千余斤小米，现已分别发到各县。现在察南各县群众兴修水利情绪极高，许多工程已准备施工。察南宣化县已完成洋河沙岭子、辛庄子段六十里的河道地形测量工作。为完成全省凿井一千五百眼、按水车二千辆的任务，察省人民政府于一月初即成立了水利推进社，进行订造、推广水车等工作。最近该社从河北省选运来了大批管式、斗式小车，发放给雁北、察南等地试验推广，很受农民欢迎。
            平原
    平原省的防洪工作，除黄河由该省黄河河务局负责治理外，全省并确定以排水堵口为重点，尽先排除水患，结合发展水利。黄河以南，以防汛为主，积极修整西湖及南阳湖堤防，争取大部地区不被淹，注意及时进行洼地排水，以备晒干地春种。黄河以北，以兴修水利为主，整修万金、幸福等二十余渠，增加水田四十五万亩。该省水利局测量队配合中央人民政府农业部测量队，已分别于一月间即到安阳、新乡及菏泽等专区所辖河流及湖泊进行勘测设计工作。温县自水利工程开工后，已将广济、常济等六河修浚完毕。
            山西
    山西省关于兴修水利的方针，确定以灌溉为主，并注意防洪。在灌溉方面，大力进行开渠筑闸及开凿各种水井，共可增水田七十万亩。防洪主要是注意平原低洼地区的排水与修治河道工程。为完成上述任务，该省提出要很好的组织群众，采纳群众意见，向群众学习。
            绥远
    绥远省今年着重发展农田水利，以达到增产要求。为此除继续修建河套水利工程外，并准备开挖大小渠共九十四道，使一万八千一百余顷田地得到灌溉。现该省已开始修渠建闸。
