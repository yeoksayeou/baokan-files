　　Report from the Changjiang Daily: The four provinces in the Central South region – Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi – have successively and universally launched rent reduction. As of the end of March, rent reduction work had been carried out or was being carried out in areas with over 43 million people across the four provinces. In Hubei, Henan, and Hunan, 60% to 70% of the areas have now fully implemented rent reduction. According to incomplete statistics, peasants have received over 280 million jin of rent refunds. In southern Henan's Huangchuan, Xinyang, and other special districts, each township reduced rent by over 10,000 jin of grain. Thus, impoverished peasants can roughly solve the problem of food for one to two months during the spring famine and partially address the difficulties of spring planting resources, allowing them to smoothly shift to production. Through the rent reduction movement, the class consciousness of the peasants has been universally raised, and their organizations have grown stronger. Membership in peasant associations in Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has expanded to over 6.56 million people, and Jiangxi province alone has over 93,000 militiamen in self-defense forces, and the village governments of 4,824 villages have been reformed. In the Xiangyang and Huanggang special districts of Hubei, over 50% of the villages have completely abolished the Baojia system and established rural people's political power. These achievements have effectively cracked down on the sabotage plots of bandits and special agents inciting riots, stabilizing social order.

　　The reasons and experiences for the above-mentioned four provinces achieving such results in a short period are summarized as follows:

　　A. The direction is clear, and the policy boundaries are clearly defined. In Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, provincial, district, and county party representative conferences, mass work conferences, and representative conferences of all sectors and peasant representative conferences were held last winter to determine the working guidelines for rent reduction, anti-local tyrant, and mass mobilization. Errors of indiscriminate beating and killing were examined and corrected, specific policies were stipulated, which greatly improved the policy thinking of the vast number of rural cadres and peasants, and enabled the movement to be carried out in a guided and orderly manner. After the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued the second rent reduction instruction in February, leading cadres in various places went to the countryside to check, hold meetings, and widely publicize it. This further corrected the deviation of believing that policy was opposed to letting go, resulting in being bound hand and foot, focusing solely on key points, and mechanically opposing local tyrants before reducing rent. Peasant representative conferences were widely used to mobilize and organize peasants to carry out reasonable and legal struggles, and it was grasped that only the rents of last year and the present year would be reduced, and old accounts would not be settled, so that the movement was quickly brought onto the right track.

　　B. In terms of leadership methods, it was advocated to fully utilize peasant representative conferences, focusing on criticizing the problems of rigidly adhering to isolated points and substituting for everything. The role of peasant representative conferences was further elevated from publicizing policies and contacting the masses to mobilizing and organizing the masses. In Henan province alone, more than 10,000 county, district, and township peasant representative conferences were held. More than 700,000 peasant representatives participated in mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out the rent reduction movement, which is an important experience in mobilizing the masses in a guided and large-scale manner.

　　C. Fully mobilize and organize the masses, raise the consciousness of the peasants, and use legal and reasonable forms of struggle to expose and suppress the sabotage and subversive activities of illegal landlords. To mobilize the masses ideologically, it is necessary to carry out class education through calculating exploitation accounts in the movement to raise the class consciousness of the peasants. Only the peasant ranks organized on this basis can truly guarantee expansion and consolidation.

　　D. In places where the masses have been mobilized relatively fully and the consciousness of the masses has been preliminarily raised, the old Baojia system can be completely and thoroughly abolished, rural people's political power can be elected and established, all weapons possessed by the landlord class can be confiscated, and the emancipated peasants can be handed over to establish militia forces. This is the most important measure to establish the political advantage of rural peasants and suppress and crack down on the counterattacks of the landlord class. The shortcomings existing in the work are insufficient attention to organizing and expanding the peasant association in the movement, and the existence of closed-doorism. For example, in Qianjiang County, Hubei, at the beginning of March, there were only a few hundred peasant association members in the entire county. In some places in Yingshan County, participation in the peasant association was limited to poor peasants, called "poor peasant groups." In some places, the combination of rent reduction and production was not good enough, and the cadre force only focused on mass movement areas, without taking out a certain amount of force to take care of the leadership of production and disaster relief in other areas. In some areas, the adjustment of the distribution of rent reduction fruits was emphasized, which caused dissatisfaction among some tenant farmers, who did not actively participate in rent reduction. In individual areas, there were also phenomena of forcibly borrowing grain from middle peasants, infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and indiscriminate beatings. The above-mentioned deviations have attracted the attention of leading organs in various places, and they have begun to be corrected one after another. Areas where rent reduction has ended have shifted to spring plowing and production.

### 豫鄂湘赣结束减租转入生产  贫苦农民春荒期间食粮、春耕生产资料大致解决  农民阶级觉悟普遍提高组织日益壮大

　　豫鄂湘赣结束减租转入生产
    贫苦农民春荒期间食粮、春耕生产资料大致解决
    农民阶级觉悟普遍提高组织日益壮大
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：中南区豫、鄂、湘、赣四省已先后普遍开展减租。截至三月底止，四省已有四千三百万以上人口的地区，进行了或正在进行减租工作。鄂、豫、湘三省到现在已有百分之六十到七十的地区全部开展减租。根据现在不完全的材料统计：农民已得到退租粮二亿八千万斤以上。河南南部潢川、信阳等专区，每乡减租均得粮万余斤。这样，贫苦农民即大致可解决一个月到二个月春荒期间的粮食问题和一部春耕生产资料的困难，这样便可顺利转向生产。通过减租运动，农民阶级觉悟普遍提高，组织日益壮大，豫鄂赣三省农民协会会员已扩大到六百五十六万余人，江西一省已有民兵自卫队九万三千余人，改造村政权四八二四村。湖北襄阳、黄冈专区亦有百分之五十以上的村庄都彻底废除了保甲制度，建立了乡村人民政权。这些成绩，都有效地打击了土匪特务煽动暴乱的破坏阴谋，使社会秩序稳定下来。
    上述四省短时期内获得如上成绩的原因和经验，综合有以下几点：
    甲、方针明确，政策界线划分的清楚。豫、鄂、湘三省，均于去冬召开了省、地、县党代表会、群众工作会、及各界代表会、农代会，确定了减租反恶霸发动群众的工作方针，检查纠正了乱打乱杀的错误，具体规定了政策，使广大农村工作干部和农民在政策思想上进了一大步，使运动作到了有领导有秩序的开展。二月中共中央中南局发出二次减租指示以后，又经各地领导干部下乡检查召开会议广泛宣传，进一步又纠正了认为政策和放手对立而产生的束手束脚、孤立搞重点、机械的先反恶霸后减租等的偏向，广泛运用农民代表会发动组织农民，开展合理合法斗争。并掌握了只减去年现租，不清算老账，使运动迅速的纳入了正规。
    乙、在领导方法上提倡充分运用农民代表会，着重批判了死守孤点、包办代替的毛病，把农民代表会的作用由宣传政策联系群众进一步提高到发动与组织群众。河南一省召开了县、区、乡农民代表会共一万余次。有七十余万农民代表参加发动组织群众开展减租运动，这是有领导有规模发动群众的重要经验。
    丙、充分发动与组织群众，提高农民觉悟，运用合法合理的斗争方式，揭穿与镇压不法地主的破坏阴谋活动。从思想上发动群众，必须在运动中通过算剥削账等进行阶级教育，提高农民的阶级觉悟，在此一基础上组织起来的农民队伍，才真正能保证扩大与巩固。
    丁、在发动群众比较充分、群众觉悟初步提高的地方，即可以完全彻底废除旧保甲制度，选举建立乡村人民政权，并解除地主阶级一切存有的武器，交给翻身农民建立起民兵武装。这是树立乡村农民政治优势与镇压打击地主阶级反攻的最重要的措施。工作中存在的偏向是对于在运动中组织扩大农会注意不够，存有关门主义思想。如湖北潜江县，三月初全县还只有农协会员几百人。应山县有的地方还把农协只限于贫农参加，叫做“贫农小组”。有的地方减租和生产结合不够好，干部力量只偏重于群众运动区，没拿出一定力量照顾到其他区生产救灾的领导。有的地区对分配减租果实强调了调剂，引起部分佃农不满，而不积极参加减租。个别地区并发生了强向中农借粮侵犯中农利益和乱打的现象。以上偏向已引起各地领导机关注意，已先后开始纠正，现减租已结束地区已转入春耕生产。
