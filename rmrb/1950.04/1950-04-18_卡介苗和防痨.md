　　BCG Vaccine and Tuberculosis Prevention
　　Ping Ming
　　The most effective way to prevent tuberculosis is to get a BCG vaccination.

　　BCG vaccine was invented by Calmette and Guérin, hence the name BCG. It is made from a bovine tuberculosis bacillus whose virulence has been reduced to a very light level. This type of tuberculosis bacillus can no longer cause illness in humans. Getting this vaccine is like getting a smallpox vaccination to prevent smallpox and can prevent tuberculosis. Smallpox comes on quickly, kills quickly, and even if you don't die, you'll still be scarred with pockmarks, so we already know how to prevent it; but every year, the number of people who die from tuberculosis is unknown, and the number of people who cannot work because of tuberculosis is even more unknown. The People's Government is now calling for production and construction, and we cannot sit by and watch tuberculosis damage the health and lives of countless people. We must not only passively treat it, but also actively prevent it. It is as urgent and important as preventing bandits and special agents. The best way to prevent tuberculosis is to get a BCG vaccination.

　　So, who should be vaccinated? Anyone who has not been infected with tuberculosis bacteria should be vaccinated, because they have no resistance. How do we know if a person has been infected with tuberculosis bacteria? Anyone who does not react to the tuberculin test shows that they have not been infected with tuberculosis bacteria. The tuberculin test involves injecting a tuberculin substance into the skin, mostly in the lower left arm. Three days after the injection, which is seventy-two hours, if it turns red and feels hard to the touch, and sometimes even develops a few small blisters, this situation is called a reaction. People who have a reaction indicate that they have been infected with tuberculosis bacteria, but these people do not necessarily have the disease. If the injection site is the same as before the injection, or if it is only red without a hard lump, this indicates no reaction. As mentioned above, people who do not react have not been infected with tuberculosis bacteria and naturally have no resistance to tuberculosis bacteria. These people should absolutely receive BCG vaccination. Especially children under one year old, because they are more likely to get sick and are not easy to cure.

　　But what is the effect of receiving a BCG vaccination? In our experience, there are real facts that can be reported to everyone. There were two groups of people with equal numbers, none of whom had been infected with tuberculosis bacteria. One group received BCG vaccination, and the other group did not receive BCG vaccination. Both groups lived in the same environment. If one person in the group that received BCG vaccination got tuberculosis, five to seven people in the group that did not receive BCG vaccination got tuberculosis. This experience tells us that although BCG cannot achieve 100% effectiveness, its power is indeed very great.

　　The good thing about BCG is that it is absolutely safe. Ten million people worldwide have already been vaccinated. Among these ten million people, no one has developed tuberculosis because of it. Moreover, the laws of several countries require people to be vaccinated. Our good friend the Soviet Union is like this.

　　The following things should be noted before and after BCG vaccination:

　　First, only do the tuberculin test. After the test is done, check the results on the third day, which is seventy-two hours.

　　Second, if the result is no reaction, get the BCG vaccination. But we should not think that once we get the BCG vaccination, we will be immediately insured, and that we will not be afraid even if we are with people who have tuberculosis in their homes. This is not right. Because resistance cannot develop immediately, it can only be determined when another tuberculin test is done eight weeks after the BCG vaccination.

　　Third, after the BCG vaccination is completed, check the needle in the fourth week, do another tuberculin test in the eighth week, have a fluoroscopy in the sixth month, and then have a fluoroscopy once a year.

　　Everyone may think that these procedures are too many and too troublesome. Can we skip one test or needle check? Anyway, it is enough to know the result yourself. This is not right. Because various reactions will not be accurate or will completely disappear if they are not checked on a fixed date. In addition, the agency responsible for doing the BCG vaccination must keep this record forever, so as to avoid forgetting what has been done and the results when personal memory becomes blurred due to the length of time. Our government is leading these agencies to be responsible for guaranteeing our health, so these records must be kept for inspection at any time.

　　The normal reaction of the body after BCG vaccination is that there are small blisters at the intradermal injection site, which disappear after half an hour; after two or three weeks, there are red spots at the injection site; after another week, there will be pus at the red spot, and sometimes the pus will break out, just like the cowpox has blisters. This does not matter, and you must not apply plasters or adhesive tape. Just wrap it with a piece of cloth that has been ironed, because the ironed side of the cloth is disinfected. It will be fine after a few weeks. A few people will have swollen lymph nodes under their armpits, but it does not matter and there will be no systemic discomfort, and very few people will have a fever.

　　Now that everyone knows that BCG is so good, you must want to know where you can get vaccinated, right? Soon, under the leadership of the Public Health Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, there will definitely be many places where you can get BCG vaccination. Now I will introduce the existing places to everyone.

　　The first place is the Maternal and Child Health Institute of the Central Health Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, Xian Nong Tan, Nanwei Road. Tuberculin test - every morning, BCG vaccination - every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.

　　The second place is the outpatient department of the Beijing-Tianjin Tuberculosis Prevention Association at the north entrance of Beichizi. Tuberculin test - every Saturday morning, BCG vaccination - every Tuesday afternoon.

　　The third place is the outpatient department of the Tuberculosis Hospital of the Beijing No. 1 Health Center in Ganmian Hutong, Dongcheng, but it is limited to residents of Inner District 1. Tuberculin test - every Monday afternoon, BCG vaccination - every Thursday afternoon.

　　The fourth place is Peking Union Medical College Hospital, every Thursday afternoon.

　　卡介苗和防痨
    平明
    防痨的最有效方法，就是接种卡介苗。
    卡介苗是由卡尔麦德和介伦两人发明的，所以有这卡介苗的名称。它是一种毒力已经减到极轻的牛型结核菌造成的，这种结核菌是已经不能使人生病了。我们种了它是和种牛痘来预防天花一样的可以预防结核病。天花来的急，死的快，不死还会落麻子，所以我们已经知道想法来预防它；可是每年因为结核病而死的人，不知有多少，因结核病而不能工作的人，更不知有多少。人民政府现在号召生产建设，我们不能坐着看结核病损害了无数人民的健康和生命。我们不但要消极的治疗它，而且要积极的预防它。和防匪防特一样的紧急重要。要预防结核病，最好的办法就是去接种卡介苗。
    那么，谁该受接种呢？凡是没有受过结核菌感染的人都该去种，因为他们没有抵抗力。怎样知道一个人受过结核菌感染没有呢？凡是对结素试验没有反应的人都表示没有受过结核菌的感染。结素试验是把一种结核菌素注射到人的皮内，多半在左胳臂下部，注射后第三天就是七十二小时，如果发红，摸着觉得有硬块，有时也会起几个小水泡，这种情形就叫做有反应。有反应的人表示他曾经受过结核菌的感染，但是这种人不一定就有病。假如注射的地方和没有注射以前一样，或者只是发红而没有硬块，这表示没有反应。上边说过，没有反应的人，都没有受过结核菌感染，自然对结核菌没有抵抗力，这种人就绝对该受卡介苗接种。特别是一岁以下的小孩，因为他们比较容易得病，而且不容易治好的。
    可是受卡介苗接种以后，到底有什么效果呢？在我们的经验里，有实在的事，可以报告给大家。有人数相等的两拨人，都没有受过结核菌感染。一拨受过卡介苗接种，另一拨没有受过卡介苗接种。这两拨人都是在一样的环境里生活着。如果受过卡介苗接种的一拨人里有一个人得结核病，没有受过卡介苗接种的一拨人里就有五个到七个人得结核病。这个经验告诉我们，卡介苗虽然不能收百分之百的效果，可是它的力量的确是很大的。
    卡介苗的好处，就是绝对没有危险。全世界上已经有一千万人接种过。在这一千万人中间，还没有因为种了它而发生结核病的。而且有几个国家的法律是一定要人民接种的。我们的好朋友苏联就是这样。
    种卡介苗前后，应该注意下面几件事情：
    第一、光做结素试验，作完后第三天就是七十二小时看结果怎样。
    第二、结果是没有反应的人，就接种卡介苗。可是我们不要以为一种了卡介苗就立刻会保险，就是和他家里有结核病的人在一起也不怕，这是不对的。因为抵抗力不能立刻发生，而是在种卡介苗后八星期再作结素试验的时候，才能断定的。
    第三：卡介苗种完了以后，第四星期看针，第八星期再作结素试验，第六个月透视，然后每年透视一次。
    大家也许以为这些手续太多太麻烦了，我们不可以少做一次试验针或不必看针吗？反正自己知道结果就够了。这是不对的。因为各种反应要不在固定的日期检查，过时就会不准确，或是完全消失的。此外负责做卡介苗的机关是要将这个记载永远保留起来，免得个人的记忆因时间长而模糊的时候，把做过的事和结果忘掉了。我们的政府是在领导这些机关负责保证我们的健康，所以这些记录是必得保留，以便随时检查的。
    种卡介苗以后，身体发生的正常反应是皮内注射的地方有小泡，半小时后就消失了；两三星期以后，注射的地方有红点；再过一星期，红点的地方会有脓，有时破了脓流出来，和牛痘发了灌浆一样，这是不要紧的，千万不要贴膏药或是贴橡皮膏，只要拿一块烙铁烙过的布包起来，因为烙过的布烙的那面是消毒的，这样过几个星期就好了。有很少的人胳肢窝底下会起筋疙疸，可是也不碍事的，不会有全身不合适的现象，也很少有人会发烧。
    大家已经知道了卡介苗是这么好，一定想知道那里可以接种吧？不久，北京市在人民政府公共卫生局领导下，一定会有许多地方可以接种卡介苗，现在我把现有的几个地方介绍给大家。
    第一处是先农坛，南纬路，中央人民政府卫生部中央卫生实验院妇婴保健所。结素试验——每天上午，卡介苗接种——每星期二、四下午。
    第二处是北池子北口京津防痨协会门诊部，结素试验——每星期六上午，卡介苗接种——每星期二下午。
    第三处是东城干面胡同北京市第一卫生所结核病院门诊部，但是只限内一区的居民。结素试验——每星期一下午，卡介苗接种——每星期四下午。
    第四处是协和医院，每星期四下午。
