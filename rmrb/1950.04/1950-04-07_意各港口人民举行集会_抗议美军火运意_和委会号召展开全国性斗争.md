　　People in Italian Ports Hold Rallies
    Protesting US Military Supplies Being Shipped to Italy
    Peace Committee Calls for a Nationwide Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 6th] TASS, Rome, 5th: The Italian Communist Party's newspaper *l'Unità* reported: On the 2nd, rallies were held in the ports of Genoa and Taranto to protest against the shipment of US military supplies to Italy. Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary Secchia spoke at a rally of working people in Genoa, explaining the significance of the recent anti-constitutional measures taken by the government and their connection with the aggressive aims of the Atlantic Pact. Secchia said: Behind the United States' transportation of military supplies to Marshall Plan countries lies the preparation for an imperialist war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Secchia called on the Italian people to resist the war policy pursued by the Italian government, and its military, diplomatic, and political actions. Sereni, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a Senator, spoke at a meeting in Taranto about the tasks of fighting for peace and opposing the unloading of US military supplies in Italy. Sereni pointed out: The fact that the US and Italian governments are concealing the location where the military supplies will be unloaded, preventing the Italian people from knowing, proves that they consider the transportation of military supplies to be a "military activity," and therefore fear the Italian people, whom they consider to be the enemy in their plans. Today, we are sounding the alarm to the Italian people: US military supplies pose a terrible threat to peace.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 6th] TASS, Rome, 3rd: The Secretariat of the Italian Peace Committee held a special meeting on the 1st to discuss the issue of the US military supplies starting to be shipped to Italy. A communiqué was issued after the meeting stating: The National Committee warns the people of the whole country that the news deliberately spread by the US military authorities and their agents in Italy, that foreign military supplies will arrive in this or that port, is intended to divert the direction of public opinion, so that it does not pay attention to the protest movement being carried out throughout Italy and the people's struggle for independence and peace. This method of spreading false and contradictory information is consistent with the usual tactics used in enemy countries during wartime. This proves that the military authorities regard this action as a real act of war.
    The communiqué continued: The National Peace Committee has issued instructions to the Peace Committees in all provinces and regions, instructing them to carry out protest movements in all regions of Italy against the first concrete war action of the American warmongers and their accomplices in the Italian government, and to take the forms that the people's struggle should take. At the same time, it also asks all citizens to pay attention to the inevitable dangers to peace and to the inviolability of our ports, railway centers, cities, and families, contained in the unloading of foreign military supplies used for war in Italy. The National Peace Committee calls on all the people to turn the Italian people's protest movement and struggle against external threats into a national movement, and to express common vigilance about the dangers that this action brings to all the people.

　　意各港口人民举行集会
    抗议美军火运意           
    和委会号召展开全国性斗争
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社罗马五日讯：意大利共产党机关报《团结报》报道：二日热那亚与大兰多各港口举行反对美国军火运往意大利的抗议集会。意大利共产党副书记谢嘉在热那亚的劳动人民集会上演说，解释了最近政府采取的反宪法措施的意义，及其与大西洋公约侵略目的的关联。谢嘉说：在美国运输军火至马歇尔化国家的背后，隐藏着反对苏联与人民民主国家的帝国主义侵略战争的准备。谢嘉号召意大利人民反抗意大利政府所奉行的战争政策，和军事，外交，政治的行动。共产党中委、上院议员塞伦尼在大兰多的大会上演讲关于为争取和平而斗争与反对美国军火在意大利起卸的任务。塞伦尼指出：美国与意大利政府隐瞒着将要起卸军火的地点，不让意大利人民知道，这个事实证明他们认为运送军火为“军事活动”，因此才害怕他们认为是计划之敌人的意大利人民。今天，我们向意大利人民发出警号，美国的军火对和平造成了可怕的威胁。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社罗马三日讯：意大利和平委员会秘书处于一日举行特别会议，讨论美军火开始启运赴意问题，会后发表公报称：全国委员会警告全国人民，美国军事当局与其驻意大利的代理机构，专意散布的这一海港或那一海港将有外国军火来到的消息，目的是要转移舆论的方向，使其不注意在全意大利所进行的抗议运动和人民争取独立与和平的斗争。这种散布虚伪与矛盾消息的方法，和战时用在敌国的惯技相符合。这证明军事当局把这种行动看作是一个真正的战争行动。
    公报继称：全国和平委员会已向各省各地的和平委员会发出训令，指示它们在全意各地区对美国战贩及其在意大利政府中的党羽的第一个具体战争行动，进行抗议运动，并采取人民斗争所应采取的形式，同时并请全体国民注意在意大利起卸用于战争的外国军火，对于和平，对于我们的海港、铁道中心、城市与家庭的不可侵犯性所含的不可避免的危险。全国和平委员会号召全体人民使意大利人民把反对外来威胁的抗议运动和斗争，变为全国性的运动，并对这一行动带给全体人民的危险，表示共同的警惕。
