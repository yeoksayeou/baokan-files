　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 13th: The Pangjiabao and Yantongshan mines of the state-owned North China Steel Company's Longyan Iron Mine, along with their auxiliary production units, have either resumed production or are actively under reconstruction. The Yantongshan mine has entered normal production; the reconstruction of the Pangjiabao mine has taken initial shape and is expected to begin mining in June this year. The equipment of the Longyan Machinery Factory has reached more than four times its original capacity as a result of repairs and new additions. The completely shut-down gunpowder factory and oxygen factory have also resumed production.

　　The restoration and reconstruction of the Longyan Iron Mine are being carried out on an extremely dilapidated foundation. The mine is one of the largest iron mines in our country, with reserves of more than 400 million tons and an iron content of 40 to 62 percent. It was once an important target for the Japanese invaders to plunder our country's resources. During the period of the Japanese invasion, the entire mine had 12,000 workers and staff members. Among them, the Pangjiabao mine was entirely mined by machines. Later, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the entire mine suffered severe damage, and the workers were scattered and gone. After liberation, the Yantongshan mine was easier to restore because it was manually mined, so reconstruction was started first. Now all the tunnels have been restored, and the various electrical equipment are also of considerable scale. The daily output has reached 30 percent of the highest output during the enemy-puppet period. In January, February, and March of this year, the mine exceeded its production plan. In the early days of the liberation of the Pangjiabao mine, the local government and mine cadres were irresponsible for protecting state property, and suffered continuous theft and other sabotage. After the former North China People's Government ordered a thorough investigation and correction, the sabotage phenomenon stopped, and planned construction began in September last year. Now the tunnels, ore transportation tunnels, and ore bins have been restored to 90 percent, and the power and lighting equipment have been reinstalled. Other electrical equipment and mining tools are also being repaired in a planned manner. Large-scale civil engineering projects such as workers' dormitories and offices have also begun this month. The repair project of the Xuan (Hua) Pang (jiabao) branch line of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, which is of great importance to the production of the Pangjiabao mine, started on March 11th this year and was completed fourteen days ahead of schedule on April 6th.

　　The workers of the Longyan Iron Mine have made arduous efforts in the work of repairing and rebuilding their own mines. Last winter, the workers of the Pangjiabao mine braved the extreme cold in the border areas and searched for lost equipment all over the mountains and plains. Whether in the weeds, in the water, or in the pits, the workers made sure to pick up even a single screw. When repairing the water pump, their hands would freeze to the iron and peel off a layer of skin; when washing the disassembled parts in the river, their hands would freeze as soon as they came out of the water, but the workers still actively carried out the restoration work. In Yantongshan, the workers contributed more than 2,000 pieces of equipment themselves.

### 龙烟铁矿迅速恢复重建  京绥铁路宣庞支线抢修完成

　　龙烟铁矿迅速恢复重建
    京绥铁路宣庞支线抢修完成
    【新华社张家口十三日电】国营华北钢铁公司龙烟铁矿的庞家堡、烟筒山两矿场及其补助生产单位，已分别恢复生产或正积极重建中。烟筒山矿已步入正常生产；庞家堡矿场的重建工作已粗具规模，预计今年六月即可采矿。龙烟机器厂的设备，由于修复和新添的结果，已达原有的四倍以上。全部停工的火药厂和氧气厂也已恢复生产。
    龙烟铁矿的恢复和重建是在极其残破的基础上进行的。该矿是我国最大的铁矿之一，矿藏量达四亿余吨，含铁量为百分之四十到六十二。曾为日寇掠夺我国富源的重要对象。在日寇侵掳时期，全矿有工人和职员一万二千人。其中庞家堡矿场系全部用机器开采。其后在国民党反动派统治下，全矿遭惨重破坏，工人也走散殆尽。解放后，烟筒山矿场，因系人工开采恢复较易，首先着手重建，现全部坑道已告恢复，各项电机设备也有相当规模，日产量达到敌伪时期最高产量的百分之三十。今年一、二、三月份该矿场均超额完成了生产计划。庞家堡矿场解放初期，由于当地政府和矿场干部对保护国家财产不负责任，曾连续遭受偷盗等破坏，后经前华北人民政府命令彻查纠正后，破坏现象始告停止，并于去年九月开始了有计划的修建工作，现坑道、运矿隧道、矿槽等已恢复百分之九十，电力和照明设备已重新按装就绪，其他电机设备和采矿用具也在有计划地修复中。工人宿舍和办公室等大规模的土木工程，也已于本月开始。对庞家堡矿场生产有重要关系的京绥铁路宣（化）庞（家堡）支线的修复工程，于今年三月十一日开始进行，已于四月六日提前十四天抢修完成。
    龙烟铁矿的工人们在修复重建自己的矿山的工作中作了艰巨的努力。庞家堡矿场的工人去冬冒着塞上的奇寒，漫山遍野地搜集散失的器材。不论是在黄蒿中、水里或坑里，工人们发现一个螺丝钉也一定捡起来。当修理水泵时，手黏到铁上便会冻掉一层皮；在河里冲洗拆下来的机件时，手一出水便会结冰，但工人们仍积极进行恢复工作。在烟筒山，工人们自己献出的器材有两千多件。
