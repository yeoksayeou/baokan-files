To the Editor:
    I discovered a green insecticide in pyrethrum. Which organization should I submit it to for review? Please reply.
                                                  Yin Zhongli

Mr. Yin Zhongli:
    Regarding your question, the Chinese Academy of Sciences replies as follows:
    The government has not yet established a unified agency for reviewing inventions and discoveries. Currently, the general division of labor is: inventions of machinery and tools can be submitted to the Central Bureau of Technology; inventions and discoveries in science can be submitted to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, the Academy of Sciences does not accept general testing work entrusted by the outside world. As for the pyrethrum insecticide you have developed, it seems appropriate to submit it to the insecticide experts at the North China Agricultural Science Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture (such as Mr. Cao Ji) for testing or chemical analysis. If it proves to be effective and useful, and is indeed an inventive work, the Ministry of Agriculture will definitely adopt it, promote it, and encourage and commend you.

### 审查发明问题  中国科学院答尹中立君问

　　审查发明问题
　　中国科学院答尹中立君问编辑同志：
    我在除虫菊中发现了一种绿色杀虫素，应递什么机关审查？请答复。
                                                  尹中立尹中立君：
    你所询的问题，现经中国科学院答复如下：
    政府还没有设立一个审查发明和发现的统一机构，目前大致的分工是：机械、工具等发明可递中央技术管理局，理科方面的发明发现可递中国科学院，但科学院并不接受外界委托的一般性的化验工作。至于你所做的除虫菊杀虫素，似可递农业部华北农业科学研究所杀虫剂专家（如曹骥先生）试验或化验，若证明的确有效切用，且是发明性的工作，农业部必然会采用推广并鼓励表扬的。              编者
