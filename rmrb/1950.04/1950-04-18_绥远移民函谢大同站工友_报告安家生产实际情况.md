　　Suiyuan Immigrants Send Letter Thanking Datong Station Workers, Reporting on Actual Living and Production Conditions

Respected worker comrades of Datong Station:

　　First of all, please accept our sincere gratitude!

　　We are immigrants who came to Suiyuan Province to participate in agricultural production. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 1:30 PM, we took a special train from Beijing Xizhimen Station to the northwest border of our motherland - Suiyuan Province. As the train left Nankou and passed through Juyongguan, we saw vast fields. The scenery of the borderland made us feel particularly excited and added to our infinite production confidence and labor courage. When we passed through your "Datong Station," a service post for the people, before the train even approached the platform, we saw your welcoming crowds - worker comrades and women sisters waving and cheering to us. When the train stopped, you all crowded at the train door, offering cordial and warm greetings, which greatly encouraged us spiritually. You also prepared a lot of food for us, including porridge, steamed buns, and pickles. We had been on the train all night, and were hungry and thirsty. Suddenly receiving such warm reception, we couldn't help but feel moved, almost to tears. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such a new society! Time separated us, and we were too moved to speak. At 11 o'clock at night, we arrived at our destination - Qixiaying. Under the care of the Wudong County People's Government, we already have a home and a future. The government first issued three months' worth of rations, one month of millet and two months of cloth. Because grain is cheap and cloth is expensive in the back mountains, we benefited greatly. The housing issue is based on the principle of one household per family. Regarding land distribution, the government took into consideration that most of us have never farmed before and were afraid that giving us too much land would result in us not being able to manage it and letting it go to waste. Therefore, based on the labor situation of each household, each person was first given five to six mu (most of which has already been plowed). This year is experimental in nature. After we gain experience, we will be given an appropriate allocation during the land reform. We are all happily preparing for spring plowing. The local villagers are extremely kind to us, helping us sweep the houses, paste the windows, and carry water, and voluntarily lending us furniture such as firewood stoves and bowls. They also teach us farming techniques, and help us deliver manure and select seeds, guaranteeing that not a single plot of land will be left uncultivated through labor exchange. This has completely dispelled all the concerns we had in Beijing. We can now guarantee that we will participate in production with peace of mind and respond to the call for large-scale production in 1950. We are willing to hold the hands of friendship tightly with you and work diligently for increased production and national construction. I wish you good health.

　　绥远移民函谢大同站工友  报告安家生产实际情况敬爱的大同车站工人同志们：
    首先向你们谨致诚挚的感谢！
    我们是来到绥远省参加农业生产的移民，在本月二日下午一时半从北京西直门车站搭专车来到祖国的西北边疆——绥远省。车出南口、过居庸关，就看到辽阔的田野，塞外的风光使我们格外感到兴奋，凭添了无限的生产信心和劳动勇气。经过你们为人民服务的工作岗位“大同车站”时，车还没靠近月台，就见到你们欢迎的人群——工人同志和妇女姐妹们在向我们招手欢呼。火车停住了，你们都拥在车的门口，亲切热诚的慰问，使我们在精神上受到莫大的鼓励；你们又给我们预备了很多食物，有稀饭、馒头、咸菜等。我们坐了一夜车，又饥又渴，骤然得到这样热情的接待，不禁感动得心酸起来，几乎要流泪。惟有在共产党的领导下才会有这样新的社会！时间使我们离别了，我们激动得说不出话来。夜间十一时我们到达了目的地——旗下营。我们在武东县人民政府的照顾下已经有了归宿，有了前途。政府先发给了三个月的口粮，是一个月的小米，二个月的布；因为后山粮贱布贵，我们更占了很大的便宜。住的问题是以一户一家为原则。关于土地分配，政府照顾到我们过去大部都没种过地，怕给地过多，种不了，把地荒了，因之根据各户劳动情况，每人先给五六亩（大部是翻过了的地）。今年是试验的性质，有了经验后，在土地改革时再给我们适当的分配。我们都在高兴的准备春耕。本地老乡对我们好极啦，帮助我们扫房、糊窗、担水，并自愿借给我们家具，如烧柴锅、碗等。他们又教给我们种地的技术，替我们送粪、选种，以变工的方式保证不荒一分地。这样使我们在北京时的一切顾虑完全打消了。我们现在敢保证安心参加生产，响应一九五○年大生产的号召。愿和你们紧紧地握着友谊的手，为增产建国而勤劳的工作。祝你们健康。
