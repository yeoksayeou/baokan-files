Hainan Island, also known as Qiongya, is one of the two major islands where the Kuomintang remnant bandits are making their last stand (the other being Taiwan). The island is located at the southernmost tip of China, facing the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong across the Qiongzhou Strait. The island covers an area of over 58,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 3 million, second only to Taiwan, making it the second largest island in China. The island faces the South China Sea to the east and the Gulf of Tonkin to the west, facing Vietnam. Qinglan in the east of the island, Yulin and Sanya in the south are all natural harbors, forming a natural barrier in South China, and are important bases on China's defense line. The central part of the island is dominated by the Wuzhi Mountain range, with continuous mountains and mostly undeveloped primeval forests. The island is extremely rich in products, with more than 20 kinds of minerals such as coal, iron, gold, silver, lead, mercury, zinc, and petroleum; agricultural products are mainly rice, sweet potatoes, cotton, hemp, sugar cane, and peanuts. The island has a subtropical climate with abundant rainfall, and agricultural products can be harvested three times a year on average. Specialty products include rubber, salt, fish, sponges, sugar, and more. In recent decades, the island has been the object of plunder by American, British, French, Japanese, and domestic bureaucratic comprador capital. In order to facilitate large-scale plunder of the island, the imperialists and domestic bureaucratic comprador classes have constructed a ring road around the island and a railway from the Shilu mining area to Sanya Port. After the disastrous defeat of the Kuomintang bandit army in Guangdong and Guangxi, a small number of remnants retreated to the island, frantically plundering and attempting to make a final stand. Consequently, the three million people on the island are plunged into an extremely miserable situation.

The people of Hainan Island have waged a long and heroic struggle against imperialist aggression and the oppression of domestic reactionaries. As early as the Land Revolution War from 1927 to 1937, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the island established an independent division of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and launched fierce struggles against the Kuomintang bandit army. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Itagaki Division of the Japanese invaders invaded the island in February 1939. The people of all ethnic groups on the island, under the leadership of the Qiongya People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force independent detachment, which was reorganized from the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and Generals Feng Baiju and Ma Baishan, heroically launched anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. The first battles at Tankou Bridge and Yongxing City severely damaged the Japanese invaders, greatly boosting morale, and winning enthusiastic support and assistance from the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese. After the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, the Kuomintang bandit army, which had been subdued in the mountainous areas, colluded with the Japanese invaders and launched a frenzied attack on this heroic anti-Japanese guerrilla force in the Meihe area. The heroic People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force, surrounded on all sides and running out of ammunition and food, repelled the bandit army with bricks and stones, successfully broke through the encirclement, and continued to persist in combat.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hainan Island People's Armed Forces have consistently adhered to the correct policies and closely integrated with the people. Therefore, despite being in extremely difficult circumstances, they have continued to develop and grow stronger. Before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Hainan Island People's Armed Forces had expanded to nearly 10,000 people, and had successively established anti-Japanese democratic regimes in Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Lehui, Qiongdong, Wanning, Lingao, Chengmai, Danxian and other places. During the Liberation War, the Qiongya Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force was reorganized into the People's Liberation Army Qiongya Column. With the active support of the people of all ethnic groups, it heroically crushed countless attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek-American collusion, not only persisting in and consolidating the original base areas, but also continuously expanding and controlling three-quarters of the island's land. Now, this people's armed force, which has been fighting behind enemy lines for more than 20 years, and the people of Qiongya are welcoming the landing operation of the Liberation Army with incomparable joy, and are working with the main forces to sweep away the remnant bandits on the island and completely liberate Hainan Island.

　　海南岛介绍
    海南岛又名琼崖，为国民党残匪最后盘据挣扎的两大海岛之一（另一为台湾）。该岛位于我国最南端，与广东南部的雷州半岛隔琼州海峡遥遥相对。全岛面积五万八千余平方公里，人口约三百余万，仅小于台湾，为我国第二大岛。该岛东临南海，西频东京湾与越南相望。岛东的清澜、岛南的榆林、三亚均为自然良港，形成华南天然屏障，为我国国防线上重要基地。岛中部为五指山脉所分布，丛山峻岭，大多为未经开采的原始森林。全岛物产至为丰富，矿藏有煤、铁、金、银、铅、汞、锌、石油等二十余种；农产品以稻米、甘薯、棉、麻、甘蔗、落花生等为主。该岛系属亚热带气候，雨水较多，农产平均年可三熟。特产有橡胶、盐、鱼、海绵、糖等多种。近数十年来该岛一直为美、英、法、日及国内官僚买办资本掠夺的对象，帝国主义及国内官僚买办阶级为了便于对该岛进行大规模的掠夺，特在岛上构筑了环岛公路及自石碌矿区至三亚港的铁道。国民党匪军在两广惨败后，少数残部退据该岛，大肆搜括，妄图作最后挣扎。全岛三百余万的人民因而更陷于极度悲惨的境地。
    海南岛人民为反对帝国主义的侵略和国内反动派的压榨，曾进行了长期英勇的斗争。早在一九二七到一九三七年土地革命战争期间，该岛人民就在中国共产党领导下成立了工农红军独立师，与国民党匪军展开了激烈的斗争。抗日战争时期，日寇板垣师团于一九三九年二月侵入该岛，岛上各族人民即在工农红军改编的琼崖人民抗日自卫团独立队和冯白驹、马白山等将军领导下英勇展开抗日游击战争，首战潭口桥、永兴市即重创日寇，大振人心，获得全国人民和海外华侨的热烈拥护和支援。一九四一年国民党反动集团发动皖南事变后，慑伏山区的国民党匪军即与日寇勾结，在美合地区向这支英勇抗战的游击队发动疯狂的进攻。英勇的人民抗日自卫队在四面受围弹尽粮绝的情况下，以砖石击退匪军，胜利地突出重围，继续坚持作战。
    海南岛人民武装在共产党领导下，一贯坚持执行正确的政策，和人民紧密地结合，所以虽在极端困难的环境里，仍不断发展和壮大。在抗日战争结束前，海南岛人民武装已扩大到将近一万人，并先后在琼山、文昌、定安、乐会、琼东、万宁、临高、澄迈、儋县等地建立了抗日民主政权。在解放战争中，琼崖抗日自卫队改编为人民解放军琼崖纵队，在各族人民积极支援下，英勇地粉碎了蒋美勾结的无数次进攻，不仅坚持与巩固了原有的根据地，而且不断扩大，控制了全岛四分之三的土地。现在这支苦战敌后二十余年的人民武装和琼崖人民正以无比欢欣的心情，迎接解放大军登陆作战，协同主力扫荡岛上的残匪，全部解放海南岛。
