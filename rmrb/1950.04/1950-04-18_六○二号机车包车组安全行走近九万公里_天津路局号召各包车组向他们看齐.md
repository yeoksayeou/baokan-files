　　Locomotive No. 602 Package Team Safely Travels Nearly 90,000 Kilometers
　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Calls on All Package Teams to Emulate Them
　　[Our Newspaper] The Tianjin Locomotive Section's Locomotive No. 602 package team has safely traveled 89,287.6 kilometers, exceeding two Class A inspection periods. To welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day, the package team has decided to participate in the nationwide production competition by completing 100,000 kilometers of safe travel, exceeding three Class A inspection periods. The Tianjin Locomotive Section's Locomotive No. 602 package team, consisting of chief driver Wu Yuchun, driver Yue Jingyun, fireman Li Songqiao, and six others, started focusing on safe travel on June 13th of last year and challenged typical locomotives from various sections in a competition. As of the end of March this year, they successfully completed their task. Over the past nine months, everyone has been working actively and responsibly, maintaining high morale throughout. After democratic discussions, the team formulated a work plan and resolutions, with the chief driver responsible for overseeing implementation, which served as the team's labor discipline. During operation, there was a clear division of labor and close cooperation: the driver paid attention to the throttle, the fireman paid attention to the water level, they assisted each other, called out acknowledgements, and focused their energy on their work. The maintenance of the locomotive was also meticulously divided: for example, chief driver Wu Yuchun was responsible for checking the boiler smoke chamber for leaks; driver Yue Jingyun was responsible for checking the air brakes, oil supply, and water pump; Liu Hansong was responsible for the running gear valve device mechanism. Each person had specific responsibilities, working together diligently in inspection and repair, ensuring the quality of the locomotive. Furthermore, with the development of criticism and self-criticism, shortcomings such as the chief driver's tendency to lose his temper and driver Liu Hansong running fast when entering the station were quickly overcome. They also demonstrated the courage and wisdom of the working class in overcoming difficulties. When they were initially transferred from Tangshan to Tianjin, they had never run the Jinpu line before. They drew a summary of the route along the line in a manual for mutual study and quickly became familiar with it. When the Bureau held a commendation meeting in early January, the chief driver went to the meeting; driver Yue Jingyun stayed on the locomotive for a week. When four firemen took the assistant driver exam, three drivers replaced the firemen, without asking the section to find replacement personnel. Everyone was unaccustomed to burning Boshan and Fuxin coal, so they researched methods to soak the coal with water, making it easier to burn and increasing power. But the most important reason was their willingness to learn and avoid arrogance. For example, the team used their rest time to visit factories to learn from experienced workers, quickly improving their maintenance capabilities. After two washing inspections, they cooperated in carrying out repairs; after three Class B inspections, they were fully capable of undertaking Class B washing and inspection work, implementing the spirit of the locomotive responsibility system and successfully completing their work tasks. To reward the package team for their work performance, in addition to providing rewards in accordance with the safe mileage reward method and the extended Class A inspection reward method, the Bureau will also publicize their work experience throughout the Bureau, calling on the package teams of each locomotive section to launch research and discussion and learn from Locomotive No. 602!

　　六○二号机车包车组安全行走近九万公里
    天津路局号召各包车组向他们看齐
    【本报讯】天津机务段攵Ｔ６六○二号机车包车组，已安全走行八万九千二百八十七·六公里，超过两个甲检期。为迎接“五一”劳动节，该包车组决定以完成安全走行十万公里，超过三个甲检期，来参加全路生产大竞赛运动。天津机务段攵Ｔ６六○二号机车包车组，司机长吴毓春、司机岳景云、司炉李松乔等九人，从去年六月十三日开始搞安全走行，并与各段典型机车挑战竞赛，截至今年三月底，胜利完成任务。九个月当中，大家工作积极负责，情绪始终饱满，该组经过民主讨论，制订出工作计划和决议，由司机长负责掌握执行，作为该组的劳动纪律。在行车时，明确分工密切配合：司机注意汽门手把，司炉注意汽水，互相协助，呼喊应答，集中精力注意工作。对机车的保养，亦有细密分工：如司机长吴毓春管检查锅炉烟室漏泄；司机岳景云管检查风闸、给油、水泵；刘汉松管走行部阀装置机械部，每人都有专责，分工合作，勤检勤修，保证了机车质量。并由于批评与自我批评的开展，司机长好发脾气，司机刘汉松进站跑的快等缺点，都能迅速克服。在克服困难上，他们也表现出工人阶级的勇气和智慧，当他们初由唐山调天津后，津浦线一次也没有跑过，他们把沿线线路概况都画在手册上，互相研究，很快就熟习了。一月初路局开庆功大会时，司机长去开会；司机岳景云曾一个星期不离车头。四名司炉考副司机时，三个司机代替司炉工作，不叫段上另找替班的。大家烧不惯博山、阜新煤，自己研究出办法，先用水把煤焖透，又好烧又增强大力。但最主要原因还是虚心学习，不骄傲。如该组利用休息时间到工厂拜师傅，迅速提高检修能力。经过两个洗检，就配合进行检修；经过三个乙检，就能完全担任起乙洗检工作，贯彻了机车负责制的精神使工作任务胜利完成。路局为奖励该包车组工作成绩，除按照安全走行公里奖励办法及延长甲检奖励办法，给予奖励外，并将工作经验公布全路，号召各机务段包车组展开研究讨论，向六○二号机车看齐！
