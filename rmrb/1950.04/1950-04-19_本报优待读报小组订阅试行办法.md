　　Trial Implementation of Preferential Subscription Measures for Newspaper Reading Groups in This Newspaper

    In order to encourage readers of this newspaper across the country to read it in an organized manner, and to strengthen the connection between this newspaper and its vast readership, the following preferential measures are stipulated for newspaper reading group subscriptions to this newspaper:

    1. Readers all over the country who form newspaper reading groups of three or more people and subscribe to this newspaper for more than one month will enjoy a 30% discount. Readers who have already subscribed to this newspaper and whose subscriptions have not yet expired, and who now form a newspaper reading group and wish to continue subscribing to this newspaper, will receive a full month's table of contents of this newspaper for the unexpired portion of their subscription; from the second month onwards, they will receive a 30% discount. The surplus prepaid subscription fee will be counted towards future subscription fees.

    2. When subscribing, the aforementioned newspaper reading groups must hold a certificate from an organization. Workers must be certified by the trade union, farmers by the farmers' association, soldiers by the political organs above the company level, students and faculty by the student union or school trade union, various agency staff by their service agency, and people from other walks of life by their respective mass organizations. Reading groups requesting preferential treatment must have a detailed list of the group, with the name, age, gender, occupation, and mailing address of each member clearly indicated. Such requests for preferential treatment may be directly submitted to the local post office, and after approval by the post office or this newspaper, the 30% discount can be enjoyed.

    3. The secretariat of this newspaper will contact reading groups enjoying the above-mentioned preferential treatment at any time. Each reading group should write at least once a month to reflect the opinions and demands of the group or other readers regarding this newspaper. The letters may be of any length and should be sent directly to the secretariat of this newspaper. Please cut off the upper left corner of the letter and write "Reader Opinion" on the upper right corner, and send it directly to the post office. This postage will be paid uniformly by this newspaper to the post office. Those who fail to reflect readers' opinions for two consecutive months will have their preferential rights revoked.

    4. If anyone subscribes to this newspaper under the false name of a newspaper reading group, the preferential treatment will be stopped immediately upon verification, and the original subscription fee must be made up.

    5. These measures shall be implemented from April 7, 1950. Any amendments will be announced in the newspaper separately.
