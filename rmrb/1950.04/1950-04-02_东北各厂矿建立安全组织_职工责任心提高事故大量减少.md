Establishment of Security Organizations in Northeast Factories and Mines
    Workers' Sense of Responsibility Enhanced, Accidents Greatly Reduced

    [This Dispatch] To mobilize the broad masses of workers to participate in economic defense work, carry out anti-espionage and factory protection, reduce accidents, protect state property, and develop production, state-owned and public factories and mines in Northeast China, under the direct leadership of the Northeast Public Security Department and the Northeast Industry Department, have successively established mass-based security organizations such as security committees and security groups. The security committee is established at the factory and mine level and is composed of the factory or mine director, the Party committee secretary, the labor union director, and the director of the factory's public security department or the chief/section head of the security section, and is responsible for leading the security organizations in the factory or mine. Under the security committee, security groups are established at the workshop or work department level to specifically carry out anti-espionage, fire prevention, theft prevention, and accident prevention work.

    Starting in June 1949, some industrial and mining units in Northeast China began to establish security organizations with a focus, accumulate experience, and gradually promote them. These security organizations are generally formed after publicity and deliberation among workers and then democratically elected. The broad masses of workers have shown great enthusiasm for participating in security organizations, saying, "Factories and mines are our own, and we should organize to protect them and not allow anyone to sabotage them."

    Through discussions on security organizations, various factories and mines have formulated safety pledges and established and implemented safety systems such as mechanical specialization, shift handover, and inspection. Facts have proven that wherever factories and mines have mobilized workers to establish various safety systems, they have reduced many natural accidents and accidents caused by negligence. For example, bad elements putting screws into the motor at the Angang Gongchangling Iron Mine and iron hammers into the crusher were discovered during pre-inspection, thus preventing sabotage accidents.

    More than six months of experience in Northeast China has proven that this kind of mass-based security organization in factories and mines is a powerful organizational form and working method for mobilizing the broad masses of workers to participate in anti-espionage and factory protection. The broad masses of workers participating in security organizations generally show a high sense of responsibility, report problems in a timely manner, and have become powerful assistants to security organs and administrative leadership. On one occasion, a fire occurred in the 11,000-kilowatt generator at the Benxi No. 2 Power Plant. In a moment of extreme danger, security officer Gao Jisheng bravely crawled into the narrow, almost fatal space under the generator and extinguished the fire hazard. To protect the machines, security team members at the Angang Gongchangling Iron Mine created a type of thermometer and inserted it into the electric roller as a safety indicator. Zhu Mantang, a security committee member at the Shenyang May 1st Arsenal, led the security group in finding lost bicycles and watches for his co-workers, further enhancing the prestige of the security organization. The workers all said, "The security group is doing good things for us workers." Everyone felt honored to participate in the work of the security group, automatically arriving early and leaving late, and taking turns on night shifts and patrols.

    At present, most cadres in state-owned and public industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China have attached importance to security work; however, there are still a few leading cadres who neglect security work. After a certain paper mill was seriously damaged by arson by special agents, the leading cadres of the mill still said, "No matter what, we still completed the task in terms of production figures." This kind of thinking and behavior, which is irresponsible towards the people's property, should be corrected immediately.

### 东北各厂矿建立安全组织  职工责任心提高事故大量减少

　　东北各厂矿建立安全组织
    职工责任心提高事故大量减少
    【本报讯】为了发动广大职工参加经济保卫工作，进行防奸护厂，以减少事故，保护国家资财，发展生产，东北各国营、公营工厂、矿山在东北公安部与东北工业部直接领导下，已先后建立了安全委员会、安全小组等群众性的安全组织。安全委员会是以厂矿为单位，由厂矿长、党委书记、工会主任、厂内公安处长或保卫科、股长等人组成，负责领导厂矿中的安全组织。在安全委员会下，以车间或工作部门为单位，建立安全小组，具体进行防奸、防火、防盗、防事故的工作。
    从一九四九年六月起，东北部分工矿单位就开始有重点地建立安全组织，创造经验，逐步推广。这种安全组织，一般都是先在职工中进行宣传酝酿，然后以民主方式产生的。工人群众对参加安全组织表现非常积极，他们说：“工厂、矿山，是我们自己的，我们应当组织起来保护它，不容许任何人进行破坏。”
    各厂矿经过对安全组织的讨论，订立了安全公约，建立与实行了机械专责、交接班、检查等安全制度。事实证明，凡是发动职工建立了各种安全制度的厂、矿，都减少了许多自然事故和责任事故。如坏分子在鞍山弓长岭铁矿马达里放进螺丝钉，在破碎机里放进铁锤，都是在事前进行检查时发现，因而避免了破坏事故的。
    东北半年多的经验证明，工矿中这种群众性的安全组织，是目前发动广大职工参加防奸护厂的一种有力的组织形式与工作方法。参加安全组织的广大职工，一般表现了责任心高，反映问题及时，成了保卫机关和行政领导上的有力助手。某次，本溪第二发电厂一万一千千瓦的发电机发生冒火事故，正在万分危险之际，安全干事高吉升奋勇钻进狭仅容身，一触即死的发电机下，扑灭了火险。鞍山弓长岭铁矿中的安全组员为了保护机器，创造了一种温度表，插在电滚上，作为安全表示器。沈阳五一兵工厂安全委员朱满堂，领导安全小组，给工友找回了失去的自行车及手表等物，更加提高了安全组织的威信，工人们都说：“安全小组是给咱们工人办好事的”。大家都以参加安全小组的工作为光荣，自动早来晚去，并轮流在夜间值班巡逻等。
    目前东北国营、公营工矿中，大部干部均已重视了安全保卫工作；但仍有少数领导干部忽视保卫工作。某造纸厂被特务焚烧遭到严重破坏后，该厂领导干部还说：“不管怎样，在生产数字上，我们还是完成了任务。”这种对人民财产不负责任的思想与行为，是应该立即纠正的。
