Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - TASS: In the grassland and forest-steppe zones of the Soviet Union, spring afforestation is being vigorously carried out. Collective farms and forest farms have already planted nearly 110,000 hectares of saplings. These new forest belts, which protect farmland from dry winds, will extend for tens of thousands of kilometers.

In Ukraine, collective farms had completed 87 percent of the 1950 afforestation plan by early spring. In Kuban, 72 percent of this year's plan has been completed, and in Moldova, 79 percent has been completed. Many regions have exceeded the 1950 plan. Planting saplings and other work are being carried out by machine and tractor stations and protective forest stations.

In addition: Among the six million hectares of farmland protective forest belts being built in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, fruit trees will account for 10 to 15 percent. It is estimated that after the completion of Stalin's plan to transform nature, collective farms and state farms will have 750,000 hectares of new orchards, providing collective farms with a large number of fruits and berries. Soviet scientists are selecting special varieties of fruits that are drought-resistant and frost-resistant, and are carefully studying the best methods for planting fruit trees in protective forest belts.

　　苏大力进行春季植林
    现已植树苗近十一万公顷
    新森林带将延展数万公里
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的草原和森林草原地带，正在大力进行春季植林。各集体农场和林场，现已种植了将近十一万公顷的树苗。此种使农田不受干风侵害的新森林带，将延展到数万公里。
    乌克兰的集体农场，在初春已完成了一九五○年造林计划的百分之八十七。在库班，本年度计划已完成百分之七十二，在摩尔达维亚，已完成百分之七十九。有许多地区已超过了一九五○年计划。种植树苗等工作，都是由机器与拖拉机站以及防护林站进行的。
    又讯：苏联在欧洲部分草原区和森林草原区建造的六百万公顷的农田防护林带中，果树将占百分之十至十五。预计斯大林改造自然计划完成后，集体农场和国营农场将有七十五万公顷的新的果园，供给集体农场大量果实与浆果。苏联科学家正在挑选能抗旱抗霜的果类的特别变种，并尽心研究在防护林带种植果树的最好方法。
