　　Shijiazhuang Railway Factory's Entire Staff Reports Production to Chairman Mao
    First Quarter Task Overfulfilled and Over Four Million Jin of Millet Saved
    Determined to Do a Good Job in Quota Work to Greet "May Day" with Greater Victory
    [Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Hebei Daily, the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory overfulfilled its first quarter production task. All the staff and workers, with extremely joyful hearts, wrote to Chairman Mao to report on production, and expressed their continued efforts to strive for the early realization of enterprise management. The original text is as follows:
    Chairman Mao: We have been talking about you a lot these days, because we have put in a lot of effort and overfulfilled the first quarter production task given to us by the Ministry of Railways. Everyone said they wanted to write a letter to you to tell you about it.
    Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang more than two years ago, our hard days have been driven away. Let's not mention the things before. To put it more recently, you worked hard to go to Moscow to do a great thing for us all, and brought back good things from the Soviet elder brother. We feel energetic all over when we think about it. Therefore, this quarter's task is two-thirds heavier than last year's, but we know that this is the first step in national economic construction. With your leadership and the help of the Soviet elder brother, we are not afraid of difficulties.
    We are short of materials for repairing trains, short of locomotives, and short of personnel, but when we think of your hard work, we feel that these difficulties should be bearable! We all know that the era of "doing whatever material is issued, and not doing anything if it is not issued" has long passed. Everyone has opened their minds, so this quarter we repaired twenty-eight locomotives, four more than the task given to us by the Ministry of Railways; we repaired twenty-eight passenger cars, six more than the ministry stipulated; we repaired one hundred and ten freight cars, also twenty-three more than the ministry stipulated; all other production exceeded the figures stipulated by the ministry. In December last year, Vice Premier Chen Yun told us that this year the finances are difficult; we have saved expenses and tried to use waste materials as much as possible. This quarter, we saved a total of 1,356,070 jin of millet in management fees, and 3,064,129 jin of millet in material costs. We are all willing to hand over this surplus to the government as other urgent expenditures. You will be happy to hear that. We feel that our efforts are not enough and our achievements are not great, and we will never stop at this small achievement. This is only the beginning, just as you said, "the first step of the Long March", especially since we had a train collision and a leak inspection accident in February!
    Therefore, we must work harder in the future to express our determination to you. We must completely eliminate accidents, continue to improve the number and quality of repaired trains, and further develop rationalization proposals and new record-breaking campaigns. Repair the cars better, get them out of the factory earlier, and increase transportation revenue; do a good job in all quota work, and strive to realize enterprise management as soon as possible.
    Wishing you good health
                                                      Shijiazhuang Railway Factory Entire Staff
                                                                    April 12th
    [Another News] The Shijiazhuang Railway Factory, under the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, with its more than 1,200 employees, has overfulfilled the production task stipulated by the Ministry of Railways for the first quarter of this year with high labor enthusiasm, and actively responded to the call of the Central People's Government to practice thrift. In the first quarter of production, a total of 4,420,199 jin of millet were saved in management fees and material costs, and handed over to the government for other urgent expenditures.
    According to the Ministry of Railways, this year's production tasks for the factory, including locomotive, passenger, and freight car repair projects, increased by 19.3 percent, 63.6 percent, and 124.3 percent respectively, compared to last year. However, based on the factory's existing manpower, machinery, equipment, and material storage, completing this heavy task was very difficult, coupled with the fact that the first quarter had only 73 working days, less than the other three quarters. Faced with these difficulties, the factory's Party, government, labor union, and the Youth League closely combined the creative spirit of the employees, appropriately allocated manpower and machinery, mobilized employees to sort out waste materials, and improved the production management system according to production needs - establishing a central warehouse and inspection and audit section to control the supply of spare parts for the repair site and assist in solving technical difficulties on site. As a result, the tasks of overhauling locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars in the first quarter exceeded the Ministry of Railways' stipulations by 16.7 percent, 27.3 percent, and 26.45 percent respectively. A regular state of dispatching cars by ten-day periods was initially established, completely reversing the phenomenon of front-end looseness and back-end tightness that had existed in the factory for more than two years since liberation, ensuring the improvement of the quality of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, and increasing operational value.
    During the work, Party and Youth League members played a leading role. For example, Li Xizi from the machine shop and Zhang Xingfu from the foundry not only created new records in production themselves, but also motivated Ping Shuyuan, who was not very enthusiastic about work, to create new achievements. Due to the rational use of manpower and machine power, the situation of workers voluntarily dedicating labor and working overtime decreased by two-thirds compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and accidents were also reduced by nearly half. From the sorting of waste materials, 1,537 various accessories were manufactured through processing, and a total of 23,557 kilograms of forged steel parts replacing cast steel parts and forged waste wrought iron materials were produced. Due to the lack of driving wheels, wheels, and axles, the workers used waste wheel spokes and wheel axles to assemble three pairs of driving wheels and 127 pairs of wheels, ensuring the early departure of the overhauled cars from the factory. All material savings amounted to 3,064,129 jin of millet. They created a glorious example of overcoming difficulties and completing tasks, and received praise from the Ministry of Railways and a reward of 25,000 jin of millet from the Taiyuan Railway Bureau.
    The factory's employees have now launched the more arduous production work for the second quarter, preparing to win greater victories to celebrate the upcoming "May Day" International Labor Day.

　　石家庄铁路工厂全体职工向毛主席报告生产
    首季任务超额完成并节省四百多万斤小米
    决心做好定额工作以更大胜利迎接“五一”
    【本报讯】据河北日报消息：石家庄铁路工厂第一季生产任务超额完成，全体职工以极为欣快的心情，上书毛主席报告生产，并表示继续努力，争取早日实现企业化。原文如下：
    毛主席：我们这些日子老提起你，因为大伙卖了气力，超额完成了铁道部给我们的第一季生产任务。大伙都说要写封信给你诉诉。
    自从石家庄解放两年多来，我们苦的日子就给赶走了；往前的事在这里不提罢，打近一些说，你辛辛苦苦的到莫斯科去给我们大伙办了天大的好事，把苏联老大哥的好东西给我们捎回来了，我们一想起就满身有劲儿。所以这一季的任务比去年那一季都加重了三分之二，可是我们知道这是全国经济建设的第一步，有你的领导，有苏联老大哥的帮助，我们就不怕困难。
    我们修车缺材料，短机车，人员不足，可是我们一想起你的辛苦，我们就感觉着这点困难应该吃得消！我们都知道“发啥料做啥活，不发就不做”的时代已经早过去了。大伙都开了脑筋，所以这一季就修好了二十八台机车，比铁道部给我们的任务多了四台；客车修了二十八辆，比部里规定的多了六辆；货车修了一百一十辆，也比部里规定的多出二十三辆；其他的生产全部超过了部里规定的数字。去年十二月，陈云副总理告诉我们今年财政有困难；我们就节省了开支，尽量利用废料。这一季共省下管理费一百三十五万六千零七十斤小米，材料费三百零六万四千一百二十九斤小米。这个节余数，我们大伙都愿意缴回政府，作为其他的急用开支。你听了一定也会高兴。我们觉得我们的努力还不够，成绩还不算大，我们也决不会停在这一点小的成绩上。这还只是开头，正像你说的“万里长征的第一步”，更何况在二月里我们曾经发生了一次撞车事故和一次漏检事故呢！
    所以今后我们要更努力，向你表示我们的决心，我们一定要完全消灭事故，继续提高修车数质量，更进一步开展合理化建议和创造新纪录运动。把车修得更好，早一些出厂，增加运输上的收入；把各项定额工作做好，争取早日实现企业化。
    祝你身体健康                    石家庄铁路工厂全体职工   
                                                  四月十二日
    【又讯】太原路局所辖石家庄铁路工厂一千二百多员工，以高度劳动热忱，超额完成了铁道部规定的今年首季生产任务，并积极响应中央人民政府厉行节约的号召，首季生产中共节余管理费与材料费四百四十二万零一百九十九斤小米，缴回政府作其他急用开支。
    该厂今年生产任务，按铁道部规定机、客、货车修理工程，较去年各增加百分之十九点三、百分之六十三点六、百分之一百二十四点三。但根据该厂现有人力、机器设备和材料储存，完成这繁重的任务是十分艰巨的，再加上首季工作日只有七十三天，比其他三季都少。面临这些困难，该厂党、政、工、团紧密结合员工的创造精神，适当的调配了人力和机器，发动员工整理废料，并按生产需要改进生产管理制度——设立中心仓库和检审科，掌握修车场所配件的供应和协助现场解决技术困难。结果较铁道部规定首季检修机、客、货车的任务各超过百分之十六点七、百分之二十七点三、百分之二十六点四五。并初步建立按旬出车的正规状态，完全扭转该厂解放后两年多来即存在的前松后紧现象，保证了机、客、货车的质量提高，增加了运转价值。
    工作进行中，党、团员发挥了带头作用，如机工所李喜子和铸工所张幸福等，不仅自己开创了生产上的新纪录，并带动工作不大起劲的平书元也创造了新的成绩。由于人力和机器力的合理使用，工友们自动献工、加工的情况，较去年第四季减少了三分之二反手活，事故也减少将近一半。从废料整理中，经加工制造的各种配件达一千五百三十七件，锻制品代铸钢件和锻冶废熟铁料共两万三千五百五十七公斤。动轮、车轮和车轴缺乏，工友们以废轮辐轮轴凑成了三对动轮和一百二十七对车轮，保证了检修车的提早出厂。全部材料节省即达三百零六万四千一百二十九斤小米。创造了克服困难、完成任务的光荣范例，获得铁道部的表扬和太原路局两万五千斤小米的奖励。
    该厂员工现已展开第二季更繁重的生产工作，准备赢得更大的胜利，来庆祝即将到来的“五一”国际劳动节。
