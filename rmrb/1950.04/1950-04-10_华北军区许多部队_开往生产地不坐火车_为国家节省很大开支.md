　　Many Units of the North China Military Region
    March to Production Sites Instead of Taking Trains, Saving the Country a Great Deal of Expense
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Correspondent reports: Many units of the North China Military Region, when setting out for their respective production sites, did not take trains, saving the country a lot of money. Many units of the North China Military Region have set out for their production sites. The water conservancy project sites or agricultural production sites that these units were to reach were anywhere from dozens to five hundred li away from the units' original garrison locations. Some could be reached directly by train, and some could take a train for part of the journey. However, in order to save the country's expenses, these units initiated marching on foot, without taking trains. A certain division had a journey of two hundred and ten li from its original garrison to the production site, and there was a direct train route. If the entire division took the train, it would require a total of two hundred train cars for personnel and equipment, with a freight cost of 2.5 million yuan per car, totaling 500 million yuan, equivalent to approximately 400,000 jin of millet (calculated at 1,250 yuan per jin). The division changed to marching, and this large expense was saved. Initially, some soldiers in the division were unhappy about marching on foot. Later, after persuasion and education by leaders at all levels, pointing out that this action of our army could save the country 500 million yuan, and this money could save many disaster victims, marching mutual aid and en-route cultural and recreational activities were also organized. On the march, many company and platoon cadres set an example by helping weaker soldiers carry guns and backpacks. Li Zhiran, the deputy company commander of a certain company, helped soldiers carry two machine guns and one 60mm mortar, and the sweat on his body soaked his cotton coat. The soldiers were very moved and took two machine guns from him to carry. But after a short while, Deputy Company Commander Li helped other soldiers carry two backpacks. Some very weak soldiers, seeing this situation, all said, "We will crawl to our destination." In this way, the soldiers' unhappiness about marching on foot was eliminated, and they felt honored and proud because they maintained our army's tradition of hard work and saved the country's expenses. When camping, an old lady asked a soldier: "Why didn't you take the train and got such big blisters on your feet?" The soldier said, "In order to reduce the burden on the people, getting these blisters saved the country 400,000 jin of millet." When the people at the campsite learned about this, they all praised, "This is really Chairman Mao's good army." (Zheng)

　　华北军区许多部队
    开往生产地不坐火车  为国家节省很大开支
    【本报讯】通讯员报导：华北军区许多部队，向他们各自的生产地点开拔时，不坐火车，给国家省下很多钱。华北军区部队，许多部队，都开向生产地点了。这些部队所要到达的水利工程地点或农业生产地点离部队原驻地相隔几十里到五百里不等。其中，有的可以坐火车直达的，有可以坐一段火车的。但是这些部队为了节省国家开支，他们发起徒步行军，不坐火车。某师从原驻地到生产地点二百一十里，有火车直达。如全师坐火车去，人员和装备共需二百个车厢，每个车厢运费二百五十万元，共需运费五万万元，约折合小米四十万斤（每斤按一千二百五十元计算），该师改成了步行，这笔大开支，就省下了。开始，该师一部分战士对徒步行军很不高兴。后来经过各级领导人进行说服教育，指出我军这一行动能给国家省下五万万元，这笔钱能救活很多灾民，同时还组织了行军互助和行途文化娱乐活动。行军路上，很多营连干部以身作则，帮助身体弱的战士掮枪、扛背包。某连副连长李志然帮战士扛两挺机枪，一门六○迫击炮，身上出的汗把棉袄都湿透了。战士们非常感动，从他身上把两挺机枪分去扛着。可是不大一会，李副连长又帮别的战士背上两个背包，个别身体很弱的战士看到这种情景，都表示：“爬也要爬到目的地。”这样一来，战士们不高兴徒步行军的情绪扫除了，而且因为保持我军艰苦传统，节省了国家开支，感到了光荣和骄傲。宿营时，一位老太太问一个战士：“为啥有火车不坐，打了这么大的脚泡？”战士说：“为了减轻老百姓负担，打下这个泡，省下国家四十万斤小米哩。”宿营地的人民知道了这件事，都称赞说：“这真是毛主席的好军队。”（正）
