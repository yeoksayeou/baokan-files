Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance today issued a notice regarding measures for paying the remaining installments of the first phase of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds. The full text is as follows:

Since the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds, the people of the whole country have enthusiastically subscribed, exceeding the quota. Patriotic individuals in various regions have also paid in advance. However, there are still some outstanding payments that need to be cleared quickly. Financial authorities at all levels of the People's Government should actively collect and quickly complete the task of this phase of public bonds. In order to complete the task of this phase of public bonds and appropriately take into account the actual difficulties of subscribers, the following decisions are made regarding the payment methods for the remaining installments of this phase of public bonds:

(1) Those who have already subscribed but have not yet paid, except for those in the Southwest Administrative Region who have separate regulations, should all pay the amount of public bonds subscribed for at the public bond price in late March within a short period of time and should not delay further.

(2) For those who pay in April, the principal and interest repayment period will still be based on March each year and will not be postponed.

(3) Because the public bond promotion period in the Southwest Administrative Region was later, the public bond price will still be handled in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on the First Phase of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds in 1950. The prices for each ten-day period in April will be determined based on the weighted average price index of national commodities for each ten-day period.

　　中央人民政府财政部发布缴纳公债尾欠办法
    各地应积极催收，完成第一期公债任务。
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府财政部本日发布关于缴纳第一期人民胜利折实公债尾欠办法的通知，全文如下：
    人民胜利折实公债发行以来，全国人民踊跃认购，已逾定额，各地爱国人士并多已先期缴纳。但仍有部分尾欠，亟须迅速缴清。各级人民政府财政机关，应积极催收，迅速完成本期公债任务。为完成本期公债任务并适当照顾认购者的实际困难，兹对本期公债尾欠缴纳办法决定如下：
    （一）已经认购尚未缴款者，除西南行政区另有规定外应一律按三月下旬公债牌价于短期内缴清所认购公债之数额，不得再延。
    （二）本期公债在四月份内缴款者，还本付息期间仍以每年三月为准，不予推迟。
    （三）西南行政区因推销公债时期较晚，其公债牌价仍按一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债条例第三条规定办理。四月份各旬牌价即依各该旬全国物价加权指数定之。
