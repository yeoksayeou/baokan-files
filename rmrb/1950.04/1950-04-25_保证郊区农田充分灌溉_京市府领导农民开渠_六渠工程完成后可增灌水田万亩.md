　　Guarantee Sufficient Irrigation of Suburban Farmland
    Beijing Municipal Government Leads Peasants in Canal Construction
    Six-Canal Project Completion to Increase Irrigated Paddy Fields by Ten Thousand Mu
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to ensure irrigation of farmland in the suburbs of Beijing and to expand the irrigated area, has been leading and assisting suburban farmers in digging new canals and repairing old canals since the 6th of this month. Upon completion of this project, not only will the irrigation of existing paddy fields be guaranteed, but also ten thousand mu of dry land can be converted into paddy fields, potentially increasing millet production by 550,000 jin. The entire project consists of six items: (1) Repairing the rice paddy canal, widening and deepening it, and adding a branch canal 2,500 meters long, which can open up 1,500 mu of paddy fields; (2) Constructing a 120-zhang-long water diversion dike for the Chenglong Canal and adding a branch canal 4,700 meters long, which can open up 2,800 mu of paddy fields; (3) For the Shiya Canal (Shijingshan to Yamenkou), adding a 300-meter-long cement water inlet canal to draw water from the Yongding River to ensure irrigation of the existing 8,000 mu of paddy fields and to open up more than 5,000 mu of paddy fields; (4) Restoring the Guanggong Ditch, which can restore 300 mu of paddy fields, and building a river embankment lower than the flood level. After this year's flood season, the embankment vicinity can increase farmland by 300 mu due to river siltation; (5) Constructing a water diversion dike for the Gongyi Canal; (6) Using cement to reinforce the mid-stream of the Xinglong Canal. In order to carry out the above projects and mobilize farmers to manage the water conservancy of each canal themselves, the district governments have led farmers to form canal water conservancy committees for each canal. Currently, the earthwork has been completed, and cement and stone masonry work are being actively carried out. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of the month. To assist in the progress of the project, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to issue loans of approximately 320,000 jin of millet according to actual needs. The loan stipulates that it will be repaid in six installments over three years starting from 1951; one-sixth of the total loan will be repaid each year during the wheat harvest and autumn harvest seasons, with an annual interest rate of 0.5%, which will also be repaid quarterly along with the principal.

　　保证郊区农田充分灌溉
    京市府领导农民开渠
    六渠工程完成后可增灌水田万亩
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府郊区工作委员会为保证京郊农田灌溉和扩大灌溉面积，已自本月六日起领导与协助郊区农民开挖新渠、修整旧渠。此一工程完成后，不但可保证原有水田的灌溉，并使旱田万亩改为水田约可增产小米五十五万斤。全部工程共有六项：（一）修整稻地渠，将其加宽、加深，并增开支渠一条长二千五百公尺，可增辟水田一千五百亩；（二）兴修城龙渠引水堤一百二十丈，并增开支渠一条长四千七百公尺，可增辟水田二千八百亩；（三）石衙渠（石景山至衙门口）增开水泥进水渠一条长三百公尺，引永定河河水以保证原有水田八千亩的灌溉，并可增辟水田五千余亩；（四）修复官公沟，可恢复水田三百亩，并修筑低于洪水位的河堤一座，今年涨水期过后，堤岸附近可因河泥淤积增加农田三百亩；（五）修筑公益渠引水堤一座；（六）将兴龙渠中流改用水泥加固。为了进行上述各项工程并发动农民自己管理各渠水利，各区区政府已领导农民分别组成各渠水利委员会。现土方工程均已完成，正积极进行水泥和砌石工程，全部工程预计月底结束。京市人民政府为协助工程进行，决定按照实际需要贷发小米约三十二万斤，贷款规定自一九五一年起分三年六季归还；每年麦收与秋收两季各还贷款总数六分之一，利率为年利五厘，亦按季随本归还。
