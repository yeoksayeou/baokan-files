Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd. Since the private First, Yuhua, Shenxin, and Zhenhuan yarn factories, and the state-owned Wuhan Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Wuhan City successively launched the processing and production increase campaign in mid-last month, the output of each factory has generally increased. According to statistics from the private First, Shenxin, and Yuhua yarn factories, a total of 1,140 pieces of yarn were produced from the 15th to the 20th of last month, exceeding the estimated output by 23.6 pieces. Among them, Yuhua's output was 189.9 pieces, exceeding the original planned output by 8.41 pieces. The factory originally planned to produce 0.969 pounds of yarn per spindle per day. After processing and production, the highest yarn production reached 1.004 pounds per spindle per day, and the lowest was also above 0.98 pounds, breaking the factory's historical production record. In the past, the state-owned Wuhan Dyeing and Weaving Factory could produce 30 yards of cloth per weaving machine per day, but now it has increased to 33 yards. The weaving factory of Zhenhuan Yarn Factory used to produce a maximum of 98 bolts of cloth per day, but after processing and production, it increased to 132 bolts. During the processing and production, the production departments of the First Yarn Factory, Wuhan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Yuhua Yarn Factory have all formulated specific production plans. Many departments of the First Yarn Factory have also signed contact contracts to ensure the quality standards and timely supply of products.

This production increase campaign was carried out under the call and leadership of the Light Industry Department of the Central and South Military and Political Committee. Its purpose is to further maximize the production efficiency of Wuhan's textile industry to compensate for the shortage of Shanghai's textile industry caused by the bombing of Chiang bandit aircraft. The department convened a meeting of the heads of the four major private yarn factories and relevant departments in Wuhan on the 9th of last month to discuss the issue of processing and production, and decided to launch a two-month shock production campaign starting in mid-last month. The heads of each factory put forward the amount and standards of production increase based on the specific conditions of each factory; the trade union guaranteed to mobilize workers to complete and strive to over fulfill the task. The Light Industry Department of the Central and South Military and Political Committee and the Central China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also assisted the factories in solving the problems of raw material supply in the production increase campaign. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union also held a membership meeting to specifically discuss the production increase plans proposed by the major yarn factories.

　　武汉五纱厂加工生产
    更大发挥生产效能，补偿匪机轰炸所造成的上海纺织生产的不足。
    【新华社汉口三日讯】武汉市私营第一、裕华、申新、震寰四大纱厂及公营武汉染织厂，自上月中旬相继展开加工增产运动以来，各厂产量普遍提高。据私营第一、申新、裕华三纱厂统计，自上月十五日至二十日共产纱一千一百四十件，较预计产量超出二十三·六件，其中裕华产量为一百八十九·九件，较原预定产额超出八·四一件。该厂原计划每日每锭可产纱○·九六九磅，加工生产后，产纱量最高竟达每日每锭一·○○四磅，最低亦在○·九八磅以上，打破该厂历年来的生产纪录。公营武汉染织厂过去每台织布机每日可出布三十码，现已增至三十三码。震寰纱厂的织布厂过去每天最多能产布九十八匹，加工生产后增至一百三十二匹。在加工生产中，第一纱厂、武汉染织厂和裕华纱厂的各生产部门均订出了具体生产计划，第一纱厂的许多部门且订了联系合同，互相保证质量的标准和及时供应制品。
    这次增产运动是在中南军政委员会轻工业部号召和领导下进行的。其目的在于更大地发挥武汉纺织业的生产效能，以补偿因蒋匪机轰炸造成的上海纺织业生产的不足。该部曾于上月九日召集武汉市四大私营纱厂及各有关部门负责人商讨加工生产问题，决定于上月中旬起，展开两个月的突击生产运动。各厂负责人根据各厂具体条件，分别提出了增产数量和标准；工会方面则保证动员工人完成并争取超额完成任务。中南军政委员会轻工业部和华中花纱布公司并协助各厂解决在增产运动中的原料供应等问题。中国纺织业工会武汉市委员会亦召开了一次会员大会，专门讨论了各大纱厂提出的增产计划。
