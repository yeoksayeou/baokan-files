On How to Master Old Skills

Some friends who have mastered high-level old skills are willing to serve the people, which is very welcome to the people. However, some friends lack creative activities to serve the people, and have not deeply studied the basic issue of how to serve the people. Therefore, in terms of understanding, they have more or less incorrect views on "skills." First, they mechanically separate skills from creative methods, and look at skills in isolation; they keep saying "I am willing to contribute the skills I have learned through hard work to the people," without further considering whether old skills can really serve the people as desired. They simply believe that with skilled and "accurate" old skills, they can reflect the new reality and educate and inspire the people, without analyzing whether this skill can appropriately describe new objects, and whether it can be completely accurate in describing them in front of new objects. Second, they adopt an attitude of insufficient attention to works that are currently serving the people; they one-sidedly emphasize improvement, and ignore the new creative parts of new art, even if it has great shortcomings, and take their favorite habitual skills as the standard for improvement. Third, they admit that thoughts and feelings should be transformed, and actual life should be participated in, and think that these should all be "learned from scratch," which is correct, but at the same time, they adopt a completely affirmative attitude towards old skills; they believe that as long as they have life and grasp the principles, the original old skills can serve the people without hindrance. I believe that if these views are not changed, even if they have a full of enthusiasm for serving the people, the people may not welcome their works; even if they want to accurately describe reality, they will not be accurate in effect; even if they are willing to thoroughly transform themselves, they will not be able to transform themselves well; even if they urgently demand to participate in actual life, the materials of actual life cannot ideally become the flesh and blood of creation. Because inappropriate estimates of old skills will hinder him from correctly understanding life and reflecting life, and being welcomed by the masses, hinder him from improving his creative methods and expressive ability, hinder him from smoothly transforming his thoughts and feelings, and accelerate the process of combining with workers, peasants and soldiers.

Indeed, the accuracy and skillfulness in old skills are very valuable, which is why the people respect specialists under certain conditions. Specialists have already produced many good results in participating in new literary and artistic work. These achievements can be seen in any art department. We do not need to list the facts one by one; as long as you have a little contact with new year pictures, new folk art, and new operas, these achievements are easy to see. Taking painting as an example, we cannot say that experts who have a good grasp of texture, volume, and sense of space will be at a loss when reflecting the new reality; on the contrary, when they depict new things and new scenes, the superiority of certain aspects of old skills is clearly revealed. Taking the old vocal skills of old opera veterans as an example, it is obviously stronger than that of beginners. We cannot say that painters who are good at depicting scenery will definitely not be able to handle the perspective of demonstration scenes. We cannot say that the sense of three-dimensionality of battle heroes is absolutely different from the sense of three-dimensionality of old nude paintings. We cannot say that new operas and new music do not need old skills at all. We cannot, absolutely cannot. On the contrary, it is often because of these that the quality of the works is revealed. However, this is only one aspect. On the other hand, while respecting old skills and learning old skills, we must recognize its limitations, and must analyze who it serves, what it reflects, and under what creative intentions, creative habits, what aesthetic concepts, ways of thinking, and what standpoints and viewpoints it has become skilled and accurate? Only in this way can we distinguish: which aspects should be discarded, and which aspects should be developed?

What exactly are skills? It is not a craft, nor is it a machine. Since it is governed by the author's certain standpoints, viewpoints, creative intentions, creative methods, and creative habits, then it cannot be as simple as launching a cannon, and it cannot be thought that it can destroy the revolutionary's defense line and also destroy the counter-revolutionary's defense line. As an artistic skill that expresses thought, it cannot be as simple as the relationship between a bottle and wine, which can be filled with new wine or old wine. For example, the texture depiction of flesh, silk, and metal by famous painters such as Titian, Rembrandt, and Rubens, the skillful depiction of clouds and mist in Mi Fu's ink landscape paintings, some of the flowing lines used in Chinese figure paintings for certain folds of clothing, and the rare skills of old opera performers, are really very accurate or very skilled techniques. Some are highly skilled techniques that have been honed through painstaking efforts. But why are they superior in this respect and clumsy in other respects? Can it be separated from who it serves and what it is accustomed to expressing? It cannot. Assuming that they are used to correctly express the laboring people, without experimentation, this so-called accuracy and skill will inevitably lose its brilliance. Sometimes it becomes a shackle. From this, it can be seen that skills cannot be viewed in isolation. Just looking at new year pictures, new folk art, and new operas, even in basically successful works, certain aspects often show the disharmony between new content and old techniques (forms). Wusheng actors who are accustomed to playing swordsmen and Qingyi and Huashan actors who are accustomed to playing old-fashioned women, when they play new combat heroes and working women, those highly skilled body movements, stage steps, dance postures, and singing sometimes appear a bit awkward and strenuous. As for fine arts, this contradictory situation between old techniques and new content is also easy to see.

For example, the old Mr. Qi Baishi, whose realistic style is very strong and is not hindered by the interest of calligraphy, so concisely and realistically expresses small animals and flowers and fruits, (this ninety-year-old senior,) his skills are really amazingly skilled. Personally seeing how he carefully and freely manipulates the brush and ink, and thus vividly depicts the demeanor, volume, and hardness of crabs and the like, one cannot but admire the rarity of the old gentleman's skills. However, the audience should be able to recall that the old gentleman showed considerable difficulty in the laboring people's trials exhibited in the Cultural and Art Exhibition. This difficulty cannot be simply explained by familiarity with the object, nor can it be simply explained by willingness to serve the people. As for those New Year's pictures that paint the People's Liberation Army with a feminine air, and the meticulous paintings with ancient shepherds sitting on the backs of cattle and adding the inscription "Willing to be an Ox for the Children," clearly show the old techniques (old forms) unwilling to obey the new tasks. For specific authors, this contradiction between "bottle" and "wine" is inevitable and cannot be harshly demanded. This is a contradiction in progress. But this contradiction illustrates a problem: not only do old thoughts and old feelings contradict new content, but even old techniques and old forms are to some extent uncoordinated with new content.

Some friends may think that the above examples are not enough to illustrate the problem, and think that the so-called "scientific" techniques with strong realism should be treated separately, and that foreign paintings and dramas can avoid this state of uncoordination. This idea is also one-sided and inappropriate. Some drama actors who are accustomed to performing intellectuals, even if they are quite familiar with workers, cannot but reveal the breath of intellectuals under the guise of workers; even painters who are good at realism also have a considerable understanding of certain characteristics of farmers. When depicting farmers, that beautiful and gentle tone is obviously incompatible with the image of strong and healthy laborers. Although the reasons are complicated, they cannot be completely separated from habitual "skills." The skillfulness and accuracy of skills cannot be separated from the objects they are accustomed to depicting and the content they often express. (Regarding the so-called realistic scientific skills, the so-called science in art, and what is accuracy in creation, will be analyzed later.)

I believe that the so-called high-level skills should be how to correctly, profoundly and vividly express the thoughts and feelings and real life of the masses of the people, and be welcomed by the masses and play the role of educating and inspiring the people, rather than simply a superficial description of the problem of "likeness" and "dissimilarity," nor is it a simple skillfulness and accuracy in techniques divorced from certain tasks and certain content. Of course, "likeness" is necessary, and accuracy and skillfulness are necessary; however, it is necessary to clarify what is the "likeness" we require? What is the skill and accuracy that we require? If we deviate from the task of transforming old skills, or even just shout slogans for serving the people but do not study how to serve better, we will not be welcomed by the people and we will not get the real "likeness." If it has not yet been combined with new content and new images, familiarity and accuracy are out of the question. Without new standards, high degrees may be low degrees. Even writers who were once versatile and possessed versatile descriptive techniques, today, when they come into contact with brand-new images, brand-new content, and brand-new creative tasks, if they do not abandon the view of excessively protecting established techniques, they will not be able to achieve smoother and faster progress in all aspects. Simonov believes that: "True skill begins with a deep study of real life, a correct understanding of real life, and a correct expression of advanced and backward tendencies." From this, it can be seen that skills are inseparable from life and thought. From this, it can be seen that old skills that are not cultivated by new realities and new requirements are subject to certain conditions. While transforming skills, we must participate in actual struggles and improve the level of Marxism-Leninism; but we must recognize that "painting working women as modern ladies" is not only a problem of ideological height and depth of life, but also a problem of skills (form), a problem of expression methods, and a problem of creative methods. As a writer's transformation, although thoughts and feelings are the most important, the so-called skills that obey thoughts and feelings cannot remain unchanged. These are all aspects of the problem, and none of them can be missing. To say one more sentence: the relationship between content and skills is not the relationship between "bottle" and "wine". New tasks require new skills. To serve the people, we must transform old skills.

The contradiction between old skills and new tasks manifests itself in different degrees depending on the person; but the contradiction cannot be denied. Transformation is also necessary. This contradiction is not something that can never be resolved. Many friends are bravely fighting the struggle between the new and the old, and are gradually achieving victory; but it is wrong and harmful to deny this contradiction. Participating in actual life and learning politics is certainly necessary, but if we do not make up our minds to transform old skills and adopt a conservative attitude towards old skills, it is often related to not very urgently demanding to transform our thoughts; because this is a problem in old thoughts. It is often related to not very urgently demanding to delve into the fiery struggle, because this is also a part of the struggle. If we relax this related link, progress cannot be achieved faster.

The transformation of old skills, like ideological transformation, must go through painful and long-term struggles. We cannot over-demand friends who are accustomed to describing old life and lack experience in serving the people to change it all at once like taking off their clothes, and immediately achieve consistency between content and form. No, the correct way is to gradually complete this transformation in the creative practice of serving the people, using criticism and self-criticism.

Old skills have valuable parts to be promoted. Whether they are artists, actors, or other artists, they have mastered many valuable things; their role in improving artistic skills cannot be ignored. (Not only should it not be ignored, but all of us literary and art workers, in order to improve our artistic level, better meet the needs of the people, and establish a new national style, must seriously learn from skilled experts in certain aspects. Regarding this issue, I will not say much here for the time being, and I hope that friends will jointly conduct in-depth research in this area on the premise of respecting heritage.) The correct way is to inherit what should be inherited, delete what should be deleted, and add what should be added, so as to achieve the formation and development of new skills. It is wrong to affirm old skills in their entirety, thinking that they are "applicable to all corners of the world"; it is also wrong to despise old skills, thinking that they cannot be transformed or improved.

The people welcome experts with skills, but they welcome even more experts who are brave enough to transform themselves; they welcome experts who can correctly, profoundly, and vividly reflect their lives and their desires and ideals.

　　谈如何掌握旧技巧
    一些掌握了较高旧技巧的朋友，愿意为人民服务，这是很值得人民欢迎的。但是，有的朋友缺少如何为人民服务的创作活动，也没有深入研究如何为人民服务的基本问题，因而在认识上对于“技巧”各有或多或少的不正确的看法。第一，把技巧和创作方法机械的分开，孤立的看待技巧；一再说“我愿以辛苦学来的技巧贡献给人民”，没有进一步考虑，旧技巧是不是恰能如愿的为人民服务。简单的以为有了熟练的“准确的”旧技巧，就可以反映新的现实并教育和鼓舞人民，而不分析这熟练性能不能适当的描写崭新对象，在新的对象之前是否完全能描写得准确。第二，对于正在为人民服务的作品，采取着不够重视的态度；片面的强调提高，忽视了那些即使有很大缺点的新艺术中所具有崭新的创造性的部分，把自己偏爱的习惯的技巧，作为提高的标准。第三，承认思想感情应该改造，实际生活应该参加，认为这些都要“从头学起”，这是对的，但同时，对旧技巧却采取了全盘肯定的态度；以为只要有了生活，把握得住原则，原封不动的旧技巧可以无碍的为人民服务。我以为：如果不改变这种种看法，即使有满腔为人民服务的热情，人民不一定欢迎他的作品；即使要准确的描写现实，效果上准确不起来；即使愿意彻底改造自己，自己也不能很好的得到改造；即使迫切要求参加实际生活，实际生活的素材也不能理想的变成创作的血肉。因为，对于旧技巧的不适当的估计，将妨碍他正确的认识生活和反映生活，并受群众欢迎，妨碍他提高自己的创作方法和表现能力，妨碍他顺利的改造思想感情，加速与工农兵结合的过程。
    不错，旧技巧中的准确性和熟练性是很可珍贵的，这就是为什么人民在一定条件下，尊重专门家的原因。专门家在参加新的文艺工作中，已经产生了很多很好的成绩。不论是那一个艺术部门，都看得见这些成绩。关于这，我们不必一一列举事实；只要稍一接触新年画、新曲艺、新歌剧，这种成绩是容易看见的。以绘画而论，我们不能说掌握得住质感量感空间感的专家，在反映新的现实时就会手脚无措；正相反，当他描绘新的事物、新的场面的时候，分明显出旧技巧某些方面的优越性来。就以旧戏老把式的发声而论，它显然要强于初学者。我们不能说长于描写风景的画家，一定不会处理示威场面的远近法。不能说战斗英雄的立体感，和旧裸体画的立体感绝对不同。不能说新歌剧、新音乐完全用不着旧技巧。不能，绝不能。正相反，常常由于这些而显出作品的精粗之分。但是，这仅止是一方面。另一方面，在尊重旧技巧、学习旧技巧同时，我们必须认识它的局限性，必须分析它是从为谁服务，反映什么，在什么样的创作意图、创作习惯，什么样的审美观念、思想方法，什么样的立场观点之下所熟练起来的，准确起来的？因而才能辨别：那些方面应该抛弃，那些方面应该发展？
    所谓技巧，到底是什么东西呢？它不是一种手艺，也不是一种机械。它既然受着作者一定的立场、观点、创作意图、创作方法、创作习惯所支配，那末，它就不能和发射大炮一样简单，不能以为它可以摧毁革命者的防线，也可以摧毁反革命者的防线。作为表现思想的艺术技巧，它不能像瓶与酒的关系那样简单，可以装新酒也可装旧酒。比如替先（Ｔitian）伦布兰（Ｒembrandt）吕班斯（Ｒubens）这样的名画家，在肉体和绸缎、金属的质感描写上，米芾的水墨山水在云雾的巧妙描写上，好些与中国人物画的某种衣褶使用的行云流水描，旧戏的难能的蹻工，实在是很准确或很熟练的技巧。有的是千辛万苦磨练出来的高度的技巧。但为什么在这方面显得优胜而另方面显得拙劣？能和为谁服务以及习惯于表现什么分得开吗？不能的。假定用它们来正确的表现劳动人民，用不着实验，这所谓准确和熟练就必然失去它的光彩。有时成为桎梏。由此可见，技巧，不能孤立的看待。就从新年画、新曲艺、新歌剧来看吧，即使是基本上成功的作品，某些方面，也往往显出新内容与旧技巧（形式）的不协调来。习惯于扮演剑侠的武生和习惯于扮演旧式女子的青衣花衫，当他扮演新的战斗英雄劳动妇女的时候，那些具有相当高度技巧的身段、台步、舞姿、唱白，有时就显得有些蹩扭，吃力。至于美术，这种旧技巧与新内容的矛盾情况，也是容易看到的。
    比如写实性很强，不受书法趣味所妨碍，那样简洁的如实的表现着小动物和花果的齐白石老先生，（这位九十高龄的前辈，）他的技巧实在熟练得惊人。亲见他如何慎重的自由的操纵着笔墨，因而生动的描画出螃蟹之类的神态，体积，硬度，不能不使人佩服老先生的技巧的难得。但是，他在文代美展中展出的劳动人民的试作，观众当能记起，老先生显出了相当的困难来。这困难，不能单纯就熟悉对象来解释，也绝不能单纯就愿不愿意为人民服务来解释。至于那些将解放军画得有脂粉气的月份牌，牛背上坐着古装牧童而加上“俯首甘为孺子牛”的题咏的工笔画，分明显出旧技巧（旧形式）不服从新任务的苦衷。对于具体的作者来说，这“瓶”与“酒”的矛盾是不免的，不能苛求的。这是进步中的矛盾。但这矛盾说明一个问题：不仅旧思想、旧感情和新内容有矛盾，就连旧技巧旧形式和新内容在某些方面也是不调协的。
    以上这样的例子，有的朋友或会以为不足以说明问题，以为写实性很强的所谓“科学”的技巧应作别论，洋画和话剧当能避免这种不调协的状态。这种想法也是片面的，不妥当的。习惯于表演知识分子的某些话剧演员，即使相当熟悉工人的这种演员，也不能不在工人外衣下透露出知识分子的气息；即使长于写实的画家，也相当了解农民的某些特点，在描写农民的时候，那优美的柔和情调，显然和粗壮的健康的劳动者的形象不相调协。原因虽然复杂，但也不能和习惯的“技巧”截然分割。技巧的熟练性准确性与其所习惯描写的对象与经常表现的内容不能分割。（关于所谓写实的科学的技巧，所谓艺术上的科学，什么是创作上的准确，容后另作分析。）
    我以为：所谓高度的技巧，应该是如何正确的深刻的生动的表达人民大众的思想感情和现实生活并受群众欢迎发生教育人民鼓舞人民的作用，而不是简单的表面的描写得“像”与“不像”的问题，也不是脱离一定任务、一定内容的单纯技巧上的熟练与准确的问题。当然，“像”是要的，准确与熟练是要的；但是，必须弄清楚，什么是我们所要求的“像”？什么是我们所要求的熟练和准确？如果离开了改造旧技巧的任务，甚至只是口头上叫着为人民服务而不研究如何更好的服务，得不到人民欢迎也得不到真正的“像”。如果尚未和新内容新形象相结合，熟悉与准确无从说起。离开了新的标准，高度可能就是低度。那怕过去曾经是多方面才能的作家，即使具备着多方面的描写技术的作家，今天，当他和崭新的形象、崭新的内容、崭新的创作任务相接触的时候，不放下过分维护既成技巧的看法，他就不能在各方面取得较顺利较快速的进步。西蒙诺夫认为：“真正的技巧是从深刻的研究现实生活，正确的了解现实生活，正确的表现先进和落后的倾向而开始的。”由此可见，技巧和生活思想不可分割。由此可见，不是新的现实、新的要求所培养起来的旧技巧，它要受着一定条件的限制。与改造技巧同时，必须参加实际斗争和提高马列主义水平；但必须认识，“把劳动妇女画成摩登小姐”不仅是思想高度与生活深度的问题，同时也有技巧（形式）问题，表现方法、创作方法问题。作为作家的改造，虽然思想感情是首要的，但是服从思想感情的所谓技巧，也不能原封不动。这些都是问题的各方面，缺一不可的。再说一句：内容与技巧不是“瓶”与“酒”的关系，新的任务要求新的技巧，要为人民服务，必须改造旧技巧。
    旧技巧与新任务的矛盾，因不同的人而表现着不同的程度；但矛盾是不容否认的。改造也是必须的。这矛盾不是永远不能解决的，很多朋友正在勇敢的作着新与旧的斗争，而且逐步的取得胜利；但如果否认这矛盾，是错误的，于自己也是有害的。参加实际生活学习政治当然必要，但不下决心改造旧技巧，对旧技巧采取着保守的态度，常常和并不十分迫切要求改造思想有关；因为这就是旧思想中的一个问题。常常和不十分迫切要求深入火热的斗争有关，因为这也是斗争的一部分。放松了这一有关的环节，进步是不能较速取得的。
    旧技巧的改造如同思想改造一样要经过痛苦的长期的斗争，我们不能过苛要求那些习惯于描写旧生活而且缺乏为人民服务的经验的朋友，像脱衣服一样一下子就改变了它，立刻取得内容与形式的一致。不是的，正确的办法是在为人民服务的创作实践中间，利用批评与自我批评来逐步完成这一改造。
    旧技巧中既有值得发扬的部分，不论是美术家，是演员，是其它艺术家，他们都掌握着很多宝贵的东西；对于艺术技巧的提高，其作用不能忽视。（不但不容忽视，我们，所有文艺工作者，为了提高艺术水平，更符合人民需要，建立民族新风格，在某些方面要认真的向有技巧的专家学习。关于这一问题，暂不在这儿多说，希望朋友们在必须尊重遗产的前提下，共同的向这方面作深入的研究。）正确的办法是有所承继，有所删除，有所增益，因而取得新技巧的形成和发展。抛弃应当抛弃的正在衰亡或即将衰亡的部分，发展应当发展能够发展的部分。（新年画，秧歌剧就是这样从旧的里面成长起来的，但新年画秧歌剧到底不是旧技巧的保留。）全盘肯定旧技巧，以为它“放之四海而皆准”是错误的；轻视旧技巧，以为它不能改造不能提高，也是错误的。
    人民欢迎有技巧的专家，但更欢迎的是专家勇于改造自己；欢迎能够正确的，同时也是深刻的生动的反映他们的生活和他们的愿望、理想的专家。
