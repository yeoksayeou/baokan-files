Xinhua News Agency: Supplementary Instructions on Spring Repair Projects Issued by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government

The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government issued supplementary instructions on spring repair projects on the 27th. The original document is as follows:

Supplementary Instructions on Spring Repair Projects from the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government (not to be issued separately)

Since the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on the 1950 Spring Repair of Water Conservancy Projects," spring repair projects have been vigorously launched throughout the country. According to inspections by personnel dispatched by our ministry and reports from various regions, most regions have conducted discussions at the provincial, county, district, and township levels, or have made arrangements and mobilizations through people's representative conferences, and have organized joint leadership structures such as spring construction headquarters or committees. Regarding the achievements of the repair work, according to incomplete statistics, the Yellow River levee restoration and hazard mitigation is estimated at over 13 million cubic meters. By the end of March, Shandong and Pingyuan provinces had completed over 5.7 million cubic meters. In the East China region, the Yangtze River main dike, excluding northern Jiangsu, is estimated at over 22 million cubic meters, of which 80% has been completed. The northern Jiangsu Yi River diversion project was originally planned for over 38 million cubic meters, of which over 23 million cubic meters had been completed by April 10th. The Huai River main dike is estimated at over 6.8 million cubic meters, of which over 2.6 million cubic meters had been completed by the end of March. In the Central South region, the Yangtze River levee restoration in Jiangxi province has now been fully completed. Hunan and Hubei had completed about 60% by the end of March. In Guangdong's West River area, 59% of the levee restoration had been completed by the end of March, and 35% of the Pearl River area levee restoration had been completed. Most projects in North and Northeast China started in early April and have not yet been counted. In the Northwest region, irrigation projects in Shaanxi, including the Han-Hui, Bao-Hui, and Xu-Hui canals, have undergone renovation projects, and the Luo-Hui canal has started releasing water. Gansu and Ningxia have also started construction one after another. From the perspective of work progress, the completion of major projects in various regions has been initially grasped. In terms of combining disaster relief with work-for-food relief, various regions have proactively implemented this policy since the winter repairs last year. The mobilization of migrant workers in various regions is mainly focused on disaster victims. Some regions have advanced the construction time to combine disaster relief. Currently, there are approximately over 3 million migrant workers repairing dikes in various regions, with each person receiving one to four catties of surplus grain per day in addition to food. For example, the first phase of the Yellow River levee restoration in Pingyuan mobilized over 68,000 people, worked for over 23 days, and had over 3 million catties of surplus grain. The second phase of the Shu River rectification project in Shandong mobilized over 30,000 people, worked for a month, and had over 6.5 million catties of surplus grain. It is estimated that all spring work, in addition to solving the food supply for migrant workers on the dikes, can support millions of family members, which is of great help to disaster relief and weathering the famine. Such large-scale mass projects require complex and meticulous organization and leadership. Various regions have also created many excellent experiences. For example, the Yangtze River levee restoration in Tongcheng, northern Anhui, grasped the principle of solid dike construction from the beginning. To avoid mutual shirking of responsibility at the junction of two villages, it was decided that each small team and detachment would divide the earthwork but not the dike sections. At the junction of the two villages, a separate force was organized to carry soil and tamp it. At the large breaches, to connect with the old dike, the old dike was first dug into sawtooth shapes to facilitate the connection with the new dike, truly achieving the requirement of tamping each inch of soil firmly. The first phase of the Yellow River levee restoration in Shouzhang, Pingyuan, underwent careful planning for organization and preparation. Earthwork was mainly done by disaster victims, and tamping was mainly done by technicians. Personnel and tools were inspected in advance, and division of labor and sections were marked with side stakes in advance. To avoid uneven labor affecting the enthusiasm of migrant workers, semi-laborers were organized separately for scoring and recording work. Regarding the coordination of earthwork and tamping, precise ratios were calculated based on typical experiments: three earthworkers were paired with one tamper, and twenty-seven earthworkers were assigned to one tamping plate. The bottom soil required 25% tamping, and the top soil required 20% tamping. As a result, the entire project met standards with high efficiency. Full laborers and semi-laborers averaged 3.2 cubic meters per day, earning over eight catties of rice. The highest, such as Lv Pijiang Village, averaged 4.18 cubic meters, earning over fifteen catties of rice. Another example is that in Wuhu and Wuwei, southern Anhui, the masses were mobilized to voluntarily combine and implement contract work methods, increasing work efficiency from 0.9 cubic meters to 2.1-3.2 cubic meters. The typical experiences and exemplary cases in the entire repair work will be comprehensively summarized after completion. Based on the current preliminary understanding, there are still many shortcomings that need to be addressed early:

  Emphasis should be placed on project quality

First is the issue of project quality. According to reports from various regions, the newly built dikes this year have improved compared to last year, but in most regions, they are still far from meeting project standards. Some cadres have not paid attention to quality requirements, and there is a bias towards focusing only on relief and neglecting the project, or the publicity and education work has not been done well enough, and the simple task-oriented viewpoint of distant migrant workers who only seek to complete the quantity has not been overcome. For example, the Huangnitang Yangtze River dike in Jiangpu County, northern Anhui, is severely damaged and must be widened to ensure safety, but the leadership is hesitant due to the above reasons, which is a very serious problem. If we encounter a larger flood this year, some dikes may not be able to exert their due effectiveness. Therefore, we specifically propose that the competent authorities in various regions conduct strict inspections, promptly correct and improve the unfinished projects, and conduct comprehensive and careful inspections of the dikes that are about to be completed during the "completion inspection," and try to improve them within the possible range, and select key points. Build more soil oxen on the embankments, or prepare materials in advance, raise vigilance, and prepare for flood fighting and rescue during the flood season.

  Grasp the Priority and Urgency

Second is the issue of the quantity of projects in individual regions. According to the current project progress observation, there is generally no problem with the completion of major projects in various regions, but if flood control and drainage projects cannot be completed before the flood season, they will completely lose their effectiveness. The flood season in the Jiangnan region is approaching, so the project tasks in individual regions that are too large, such as northern Jiangsu in the East China region, excluding the cotton reclamation area project, the planned quantity is a total of over 52 million cubic meters, and only over 23 million cubic meters have been completed. In order to complete on schedule, it is natural to further promote it vigorously, and at the same time, we must effectively grasp the priority and urgency of various projects and the allocation and use of people's labor, so that urgently needed projects can definitely be completed, and the projects that have been built can definitely produce benefits.

  Avoid Waste

Third is the issue of waste in repair work. This year's spring repair project, due to insufficient experience and lack of cadres, the preparation work was not practical in many cases, and there was still more or less waste. For example, during the survey and line determination of the Huangnitang Yangtze River levee restoration in Jiangpu County, northern Anhui, it was considered that there was water accumulation on both sides of the old levee, and it was difficult to extract soil, so it was decided to rebuild a new levee. After starting construction and completing 90,000 cubic meters, the new levee was abandoned due to poor soil quality and foundation, and the old levee was rebuilt, wasting 60,000 workdays. Another example is the Zhengyang South Huai Dike in Zhengyang City, the Huai-Ren branch section of the Xiage Dike in Huoqiu County, and the Shouxi Huai Dike in Shou County, all three sections of the dike are intended to isolate the external water (the Huai River or its tributaries) from the internal water lakes, hoping that after isolation, a part of the internal lake water can be discharged, leaving out the lake land to increase planting. This enthusiasm for water control and increased production is very good, but both sides are water, and the dike is built on silt. Construction is extremely difficult. Even if the project is completed, there are still many problems in how to discharge the accumulated water in the future, how to prevent it from being immersed by rainwater from the highlands, and how to ensure the project benefits. Currently, the Beihong dike of the Zhengnan dike has already been breached due to the rise of the Pi River on April 6. Whether to continue the repair in the future should be considered by the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau and the East China Water Conservancy Department. These are all waste phenomena caused by insufficient prior investigation and research, or only relying on subjective enthusiasm and disregarding objective conditions. As for the waste that occurred during the construction period due to insufficient preparation, migrant workers arriving at the dike without food and accommodation prepared, unclear division of work sections, and lack of organization of migrant workers, such as Fengtai and Sihong in northern Anhui during the winter repairs last year, and Liangshan in Pingyuan during the spring repairs this year, have caused a lot of losses. The competent authorities have already reviewed them, and it is hoped that the same mistakes will not happen again in various regions.

  Fair and Timely Distribution of Work Grain

Fourth is the issue of earthwork unit price and work grain distribution. There is no uniform regulation for earthwork unit price nationwide. Generally, it is determined by various regions according to specific conditions and adapting to local conditions. There are also several individual deviations since the start of construction. One is the error of egalitarianism. For example, in the Subei Yi River Diversion Project, except for Zhangshan Ridge Cutting, the unit price per cubic meter is 8.4 catties of miscellaneous grain, the rest is uniformly 2.4 catties, completely ignoring the difference in soil quality (sandy soil and black silt) and the difficulty of construction conditions, so that the morale of migrant workers cannot be improved. In some areas, because there are not enough cadres, it is impossible to settle accounts after work is completed, and even completely adopt the method of borrowing. At the beginning of the second phase of the project, the first phase of work accounts has not been cleared, completely losing the meaning of calculating work and giving capital, doing more and earning more, and encouraging migrant workers to compete with each other. These shortcomings must be corrected immediately.

  Strengthen Security, Publicity, and Education

Fifth is the security, publicity, education, and hygiene work of the construction site. For such mass projects, security work and publicity, education, and hygiene work are all indispensable. In the Chaobai River downstream rectification project in Hebei Province, more than 100 people were poisoned in Pinggu County. All regions should be vigilant and strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents. Spring epidemics are prevalent, and some regions have not paid enough attention to the hygiene of the construction site. For example, in the Chaobai River downstream rectification project, due to continuous heavy rain, more than 400 migrant workers became ill. Although it was an accident, it was also due to insufficient prior estimation and inadequate preparation for migrant workers' food, accommodation, and medical care. Other regions also have similar situations that need to be remedied urgently. Dike repair and water control are projects that the masses urgently need. In order to rely on the masses, we must strengthen publicity and education to inspire the masses to consciously and voluntarily work hard. At the same time, we must promote a democratic style, deeply understand the opinions of the masses, so as to overcome many problems of interest conflicts between upstream and downstream, and solve the difficulties felt by the masses in the repair work. This is an important part of organization and leadership, and there are also phenomena that various regions have not paid attention to. For example, the drainage project in Huaxian and Huayin, Shaanxi is about to start, but local opinions have not yet been unified. Another example is the Xin Gaifang flood diversion project of the Daqing River in Hebei Province, which has already signed a contract with the military industry, but was abandoned due to the disagreement of the masses. The leadership must pay attention to these shortcomings.

In short, this year's spring repair project alone involves 200 million cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for more than 70% of the total project cost. Time is tight, and it must be completed before May and June. Coupled with the lack of experience and cadres, the understanding of the situation and design preparation are all felt to be hasty. The arduousness of this task was originally expected, but due to the urgent needs of the masses and production, we must resolutely ensure timely completion. The valuable experience of one place should be promoted and introduced, and the mistakes that have already occurred in one place must not be repeated in other places. The shortcomings in project quality can still be remedied now. The major flood season is approaching, and the repair of one square meter of soil must exert the effect of one square meter of soil. It is hoped that various regions will strengthen leadership and fight for this goal.

　　中央人民政府水利部发布
    关于春修工程的补充指示
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府水利部二十七日发布春修工程补充指示，原件如下：
    中央人民政府水利部关于春修工程的补充指示（不另行文）
    自从政务院发布“关于一九五○年水利春修工程的指示”以后，全国各地春修工程均已大力展开，根据我部派员检查和各地工作报告，多数地区都经过省县区乡逐级的讨论，或通过人民代表会议作了布置动员，组织起春工指挥部或委员会等共同领导的机构。修工成绩，据不完全的统计，黄河复堤整险预计一千三百余万公方，截止三月底，山东平原两省已完成五百七十余万公方。华东区长江干堤，除苏北外预计二千二百余万公方，现已完成百分之八十。苏北导沂工程原计划三千八百余万公方，截止四月十日已完成二千三百余万公方。淮河干堤预计六百八十余万公方，截止三月底已完成二百六十余万公方。中南区长江复堤，江西省现已全部完成。湖南湖北截止三月底已完成百分之六十左右。广东西江区复堤三月底已完成百分之五十九，珠江区复堤已完成百分之三十五，华北东北大部工程四月初开始，尚未统计。西北区灌溉工程，陕西汉惠、褒惠、湑惠三渠进行了整修工程，洛惠渠已开始放水。甘肃宁夏亦先后动工。从工作进度上看，各地重要工程都已获得完成任务的初步把握。就结合救灾以工代赈而言，各地从去年冬修开始，便都主动地执行了这一政策，各地动员民工皆以灾民为主，有的为结合救灾，提早了施工时间，目前各地修堤民工，约计三百余万人，每人每日除吃外可余粮一斤至四斤。如平原第一期黄河复堤，动员六万八千余人，工作二十三日余粮三百余万斤，山东第二期整沭工程动员三万余人，工作一月，余粮六百五十余万斤，估计全部春工除去解决上堤民工口粮以外，尚可养活家属数百万人，对救灾渡荒，有极大的帮助。这样大规模群众性的工程，组织领导是复杂而细致的工作，各地也创造了很多优良的经验，如皖北桐城长江复堤，一开始便掌握了修堤坚固的方针，为避免两村接头的地方互相推诿，决定各小队各分队，分土方不分堤段，两村接头的地方，组织单独力量挑土打硪。在大溃口的地方，为与老堤接合，先把老堤挖成锯齿，以便与新堤衔接，确实做到了尺土层硪夯打坚实的要求。平原寿张第一期黄河复堤，组织准备，都经过精心策划，土工以灾民为主，硪工以技术为主，人员工具事前都经过检查，分工分段事前都打好边桩，为避免劳力不齐影响民工的积极努力，半劳动力单独组织，评分记工。关于土工与硪工的配合，根据典型试验，算出精确的比率，三个土工配合一个硪工，二十七个土工配硪一盘，底土需硪百分之二十五，顶土需硪百分之二十。结果全部工程既合标准效率又高，全劳力半劳力每日平均三·二公方，得米八斤有余。最高如吕皮匠村，平均四·一八公方，得米十五斤有余。又如皖南无为芜湖发动群众自愿结合，实行包工办法，使工作效率从○·九公方提高到二·一至三·二公方。关于全部修工中的典型经验，英范事例，尚待竣工以后作全面的总结。根据现在初步了解，也还存在着许多缺点，需要先行提出，早谋补救：
  工程质量应加重视
    第一是工程质量问题。根据各地报告，今年新修的堤防虽比去年皆有进步，但是多数地区，还与工程标准相距甚远。部分干部没有重视质量上的要求，存在着只顾救济忽略工程的偏向，或者是宣传教育工作做得不够，没有克服远方民工只求完成数量的单纯任务观点。如皖北江浦县黄泥滩江堤，堤身残破，必须加宽，才能保证安全，可是领导方面却因上述的原因而感犹疑不决，这是一个很严重的问题，万一今年再遇较大的洪水，部分堤防或将不能发生应有的效能。所以我们特别提出，要求各地主管机关进行严格的检查，尚未完成的工程，要迅速纠正，急谋改善，即将完成的堤段，在“竣工检验”的时候，要进行全面的、认真的检查，在可能范围内设法改善，并选择重点，在堤岸多做土牛，或者提前准备料物，提高警惕，预作防汛期间抢险的准备。
  切实掌握先后缓急
    第二是个别地区的工程数量问题。根据现在工程进度观察，各地主要工程完成任务一般尚无问题，但因防洪排水工程，如果在汛前不能完成，便完全失去工程的效用，江南地区汛期已近，所以个别地区工程任务过于巨大者，如华东区苏北一地，除棉垦区工程不计外，计划数量共五千二百余万公方，现仅完成二千三百余万公方，为了按期完成，自然尚须大力推进，同时还要切实掌握各项工程的先后缓急，与人民劳力的分配使用，使迫切需要的工程一定能够完成，已经兴修的工程一定发生效益。
  避免发生浪费现象
    第三是修工当中的浪费问题。今年春修工程，因为经验不足，干部不够，事前的准备多未切实，或多或少的浪费现象依然存在。如皖北江浦县黄泥滩长江复堤，勘查定线的时候，认为旧堤两面积水，取土困难，决定改修新堤，已经开工做了九万公方以后，又因新堤土质不良，地基不好，无法打硪，放弃了新堤再修旧堤，浪费六万余工。又如淮河六安专区，正阳市之正南淮堤，霍邱县淮任支段下格堤，寿县之寿西淮堤，三段堤防都是打算隔绝外水（淮河或其支流）与内水湖泊，希望隔绝后，能将内湖水量排除一部，空出滨湖土地增加种植，这种治水增产的热情很好，但是两岸皆水，筑堤于淤泥之上。施工极难。即便工程完成，将来如何排除积水，如何防止再受高地雨水的潦浸，以保证工程效益，问题尚多，目前正南堤之北横堤已因四月六日陴河涨水而生溃决，将来是否续修，应由淮河水利工程总局与华东水利部考虑意见，这些都是事前调查研究不够，或只凭主观热情不顾客观条件所造成的浪费现象。至于施工期间因为准备不足，民工到堤，食宿尚未备妥，工段划分不清，民工缺乏组织，所发生的浪费，如去年冬修期间皖北的凤台泗洪，今年春修期间平原的梁山，都曾造成很多损失，主管机关业已做过检讨，希望各地不再发生同样的错误。
  发放工粮要公平及时
    第四是土方单价与工粮发放问题。土方单价全国没有统一的规定，大抵皆由各地根据具体情况，因地制宜，施工以来也有几种个别的偏差。一种是平均主义的错误，如苏北导沂工程，除嶂山切岭，每公方单价杂粮八斤四两外，其余一律二斤四两，完全忽视了土质的不同（沙土与黑淤土）与施工条件的难易，以致民工情绪不能提高。有的地区因为干部不足，不能做到工完账结，甚至完全采用借支办法，第二期工程开始，第一期工账未清，完全失掉计工给资，多做多得，鼓励民工互相竞赛的意义，这些缺点必须立即纠正。
  加强保卫与宣教工作
    第五是工地的保卫与宣教卫生等工作。这样群众性的工程，保卫工作与宣教卫生工作皆属必不可少，河北省潮白河下游整理工程，平谷县曾经发生一百余人中毒的事件，各地都应提高警惕，严防匪特的破坏。春季疾疫流行，有的地区对工地卫生也注意不够，如潮白河下游整理工程，因连日大雨，民工患病者达四百余人，虽系事出意外，亦由事前估计不足，对民工食宿医疗准备不周。其他地区也有类似的情形，需要急谋补救。修堤治水是群众切身需要的工程，为了依靠群众，必须加强宣传教育，以启发群众自觉自愿的努力，同时要发扬民主作风，深入了解群众的意见，才能克服上下游利害冲突的许多问题，并解决群众在修工中所感的困难，这是组织领导的重要环节，各地亦有注意不到的现象，如陕西华县华阴排水工程，即将开工，地方意见尚未一致，又如河北省大清河新盖房分洪道工程，已与军工订立合同，又因群众不同意而放弃，这些缺点领导方面必须切实注意。
    总之今年春修工程，仅土工一项数达二亿立方公尺，占全部工程经费百分之七十以上，时间紧迫，必须在五六月前完成，再加经验缺乏，干部不足，情况了解与设计准备，均感仓促，这一任务的艰巨原在意料之中，但是由于群众与生产的迫切需要，我们必须坚决保证及时完成，一个地方的宝贵经验。应该推广介绍，一个地方已经发生的错误，别的地方必须不再重复。工程质量存在的缺点，现在还有补救的机会，大汛将届，修一方土必须要发生一方土的效力，希望各地加强领导，为这一目标而斗争。
      一九五○年四月二十七日
