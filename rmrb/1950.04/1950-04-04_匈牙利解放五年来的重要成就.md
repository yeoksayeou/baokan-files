　　Important Achievements in the Five Years Since the Liberation of Hungary
　　Old Hungary was a backward feudal country ruled by nobles, landlords, and industrialists representing foreign capital. On April 4, 1945, after the Soviet army liberated Hungary, the Workers' Party led the establishment of a people's democratic regime. Over the past five years, the people's democratic government has won the unanimous support of the people with its wise policies. In last year's parliamentary elections, the People's Front led by the Workers' Party won as high as 95.6 percent of the votes. In August of the same year, the parliament passed the constitution. The new constitution was formulated based on the important domestic changes, namely the rule of the working class, the nationalization of industry, and the land reform, and determined Hungary's path towards socialism.
　　On the road of construction, the Hungarian People's Republic has more than once defeated the subversive conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad and crushed the espionage activities carried out by American and British imperialists in the country. In particular, the defeat of the treasonous conspiracy of former Prime Minister Nagy in 1947, and the trial of cleric Mindszenty and traitor Rajk last year, fully proved the consolidation of the Hungarian people's democratic regime and the strengthening of the people's power.
　　Hungary's main economic achievement in the past five years was the completion of the three-year plan for economic development in two years and five months, from August 1947 to the end of last year. Before the war, Hungary's degree of industrialization was not high. Industrial production accounted for only 35.3 percent of the national income. The plunder by German fascists during the war caused Hungary's wealth to lose 42.2 percent, and industry to lose one-third. However, after the completion of the three-year plan, the Hungarian people not only healed the serious war damage, but also exceeded the pre-war level in production. By the end of last year, Hungary's total industrial output had increased by 40 percent compared with 1938, and agricultural production had reached the pre-war level. The socialist part of the national income reached 66 percent. The proportion of industrial production in the national economy has been raised to 49.7 percent. This has enabled Hungary to smoothly start a new five-year plan to accelerate the country's industrialization this year in order to lay the foundation for socialism. The new five-year plan will concentrate on developing heavy industry. By 1954, industrial income will account for 58.7 percent of the national income. According to Pravda, Hungary's industry will complete the progress achieved in the 50 years before the war in the next five years.
　　Before the war, 1% of the agricultural population in Hungary possessed about 50% of the cultivated land. In 1945, Hungary implemented land reform and established state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture. Now state-owned farms cultivate 228,000 hectares of land. By the end of last year, 1,520 agricultural production cooperatives had been established, cultivating more than 200,000 hectares of land.
　　When the three-year plan was completed, unemployment had disappeared, and there was a shortage of skilled workers everywhere. Under the thriving new atmosphere in the country, the Hungarian people who had gone abroad to make a living before the war have returned to their motherland one after another to participate in construction. Education has also progressed rapidly. There are now 1.1 million students in the eight-year primary schools (only 140,000 before the war). Last year, workers' and peasants' children accounted for half of the 40,000 new students in middle schools. One-third of the higher education institutions were workers last year.
　　At the end of the war, the living standards of Hungarian workers were less than 50 percent of the 1938 level. When the three-year plan was completed, the real wages of workers had exceeded 40 percent of 1938. The working people generally enjoy the rights to vacation, entertainment, social insurance, free medical care, and education.
　　The Hungarian people are advancing towards socialism with a hundredfold enthusiasm and confidence, and are strengthening the Hungarian People's Republic with their brilliant labor achievements, thereby strengthening the forces of the world peace and democracy camp.

### 匈牙利解放五年来的重要成就

　　匈牙利解放五年来的重要成就
    旧匈牙利是一个落后的封建国家，由贵族、地主和代表外国资本的工业家统治着。一九四五年四月四日，苏军解放匈牙利后，工人党领导建立了人民民主政权。五年来人民民主政府以其英明的政策赢得了人民的一致拥戴，在去年议会选举时，工人党领导的人民阵线获得了高达百分之九十五点六的选票。同年八月，议会通过了宪法。新宪法是根据国内的重要变革，即在工人阶级执政、工业国有化和土地改革的基础上制订的，并确定了匈牙利走向社会主义的道路。
    匈牙利人民共和国在建设的道路上，不止一次地战胜了国内外敌人的颠覆阴谋，粉碎了美英帝国主义者在国内进行的间谍活动，特别是一九四七年前总理奈基叛国阴谋的被击败，去年教士明曾蒂与叛贼拉伊克的受审判，充分证明了匈牙利人民民主政权的巩固和人民力量的增强。
    匈牙利五年来在经济上的主要成就，是从一九四七年八月到去年年底，以两年零五个月的时间，完成了发展经济的三年计划。战前，匈牙利工业化的程度是不高的。工业生产仅占国民收入的百分之三十五点三。战争期间德国法西斯的掠夺使匈牙利财富损失达百分之四十二点二，工业损失三分之一。但在三年计划完成后，匈牙利人民不但医好了严重的战争破坏，而且在生产上超过了战前的水平。至去年年底，匈牙利的工业生产总额较一九三八年增加了百分之四十，农业生产已达战前水平。国民收入中社会主义部分达到了百分之六十六。工业生产所占国民经济的比例，已提到百分之四十九点七。这就使得匈牙利在今年顺利开始了加速全国工业化的新五年计划，以奠定社会主义的基础。新的五年计划将集中力量发展重工业，到一九五四年，工业收入将占国民收入的百分之五十八点七。据真理报估计：匈牙利工业在今后五年中将完成战前五十年间所达到的进步。
    战前，匈牙利农业中占农业人口百分之一的人，占有百分之五十左右的耕地。一九四五年匈牙利实行了土地改革，并在农业的社会主义改造过程中建立了国营农场和农业生产合作社，现在国营农场耕种着二十二万八千公顷的田地，到去年年底，已建立了一千五百二十个农业生产合作社，耕地占二十万余公顷。
    在三年计划完成时，失业现象已经绝迹，到处都感到技术工人的供不应求。在国内欣欣向荣的新气象下，战前出国谋生的匈牙利人民已纷纷返回祖国，参加建设。教育事业也已飞速进展，八年制的初级学校，现有学生一百十万人（战前仅十四万人），去年中学校的四万新生中，工农子弟占了一半，高等教育机关去年有三分之一是工人。
    战争结束时，匈牙利劳动者的生活水平尚不及一九三八年水平的百分之五十。三年计划完成时，工人的实际工资已超过一九三八年百分之四十。劳动人民普遍享受到休假、娱乐、社会保险、免费医疗及受教育的权利。
    匈牙利人民正以百倍的热情与信心向社会主义迈进，并以其辉煌的劳动成果来加强匈牙利人民共和国，从而也就是加强保卫世界和平民主阵营的力量。
