[Reported by our correspondent Kang Weizhong] Private industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing are undergoing changes. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Bureau of Commerce regarding openings and closures in March, it is clear that the number of industrial enterprises opening exceeds the number closing, while in commerce, the number closing exceeds the number opening. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Bureau of Commerce: In the industrial sector, among 22 industries, 274 enterprises opened in March, while only 95 closed, resulting in a net increase of 179 enterprises. In the commercial sector, 234 businesses were approved to open in March, while 292 closed, resulting in 58 more closures than openings. Considering both industry and commerce, there was a net increase of 121 enterprises. This illustrates the trend of change and development in Beijing's industry and commerce. Analyzing the specific industries that opened and closed, this trend becomes even more apparent: Those industrial and commercial enterprises closely related to national construction and the people's needs not only remain largely unaffected but have also seen some growth. However, those industrial and commercial enterprises that thrived on soaring prices and speculation are experiencing a high number of closures.

Industry Sector

In the industrial sector, industries with a larger number of openings include machinery manufacturing (19), dyeing and weaving (148, including those that had already opened but only registered in March), as well as flour milling, leather manufacturing, printing, chemical, and rubber industries. In March, the production of flour, ironworks, leather, dyeing and weaving, and printing industries was relatively good. The ability of these industries to survive, increase, and develop is due, on the one hand, to their suitability to the needs of the broad masses of the people, and in some cases, their suitability to seasonal demand (such as leather and printing industries); on the other hand, it is due to the strong support and assistance from state-owned economic institutions. State-owned economic institutions have solved the raw material supply and sales problems for various factories through processing, exchange, and ordering methods. For example, 80% of the factories in the dyeing and weaving industry have signed exchange contracts with the Beijing Cotton and Cloth Company, resolving production and sales difficulties. Especially after the recent adjustment of the exchange ratio prices, the profits of various factories have increased, and the enthusiasm for production has become even higher. The flour milling industry produced 245,000 bags in March, of which 200,000 bags were processed for the state-owned grain company. State-owned enterprises such as the Beijing Machinery Manufacturing Plant, in order to unite and support private iron factories, ordered 2,700 waterwheels and many kinds of agricultural tools from the industry in March; at the same time, the state-owned Coal and Iron Company also partially guaranteed the supply of coal, iron, and other fuels and raw materials. However, some industries, facing the off-season, are still blindly producing; some industries have low production technology, high costs, and oversupply of products; industries such as knitting, soy sauce, sesame oil, and matches have encountered difficulties.

Commercial Sector

In the commercial sector, the industries with the most openings include rice and flour (9), flour-based food (19), bicycle (21), and automobile (14) industries. These are industries related to the daily life and transportation needs of the people. These industries are developing. The commercial enterprises approved for closure by the Bureau of Commerce are mostly grain depots, silk and satin shops, cloth shops, dried fruit and seafood shops, etc. Among them, dried fruit and seafood are facing the off-season and are not essential for people's livelihoods; silk and satin are luxury consumer goods, which in the past mostly served the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and feudal classes and had nothing to do with the lives of ordinary people; while grain depots and cloth shops, although needed by the people, mostly relied on inflation, hoarding, speculation, and lacked sufficient capital in the past. They used high-interest loans (27% to 30%) from private banks to operate. As a result, in March, when prices stabilized, they could not circulate their capital due to competitive dumping and collapsed.

　　私营工商业开始发生变化
    京市正当行业有发展
    依赖物价暴涨而发横财的很多歇业
    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：北京市私营工商业现正在变化中。据三月份京市工业局和商业局开业和歇业的统计，明确说明了工业开业的数目比歇业的多；而商业则是歇业比开业的多。据京市工业局和商业局的统计：工业方面二十二个行业中三月份开业者为二百七十四户，歇业的仅九十五户，开歇业相抵实增一百七十九户。商业在三月份经批准开业的有二百三十四户，歇业的有二百九十二户，歇业比开业多五十八户。工商两业开歇业相抵，实增一百二十一户。这说明了北京工商业变化发展的趋势。若从开业和歇业的具体行业分析，则这种趋势已更加明显，即：凡是与国家建设、人民需要密切相关的工商业，不仅绝大部分并无影响，而且有所增加；但是过去依赖物价暴涨，投机倒把发展起来的工商业则歇业者多。
  工业方面
    在工业方面，开业户较多的计机器制造业十九户，染织业一百四十八户（包括过去早已开业而在三月份才申报的）及面粉、制革、印刷、化学、橡胶等业。在三月份，生产较好的是面粉、铁工、制革、染织、印刷等六业。这些行业之所以能存在、增加和发展，一方面是由于适用于广大人民的需要；有些是适合季节性（如制革、印刷业）；另一方面是由于国营经济机构有力的支持和扶植的结果。国营经济机构曾用加工、交换和订购的方法解决了各厂的原料供给和销路问题。如染织业中百分之八十的工厂都与北京花纱布公司订了交换合同，解决了产销困难，尤以最近调整了交换比例价格后，各厂利润提高，生产情绪更形高涨。面粉业三月份生产二十四万五千袋，其中替国营粮食公司加工者即有二十万袋。北京机器制造厂等国营企业为了团结和扶植私营铁工厂，曾在三月份订购该业水车两千七百台及各种农具很多；同时国营煤铁公司也部分地保证了煤、铁等燃料与原料的供给。但，有些工业，则因面临淡月，而仍盲目生产；有些工业则因生产技术低，成本大，生产品又过剩；如针织、酱油、芝麻油、火柴等业都遇到了困难。
  商业方面
    在商业方面，开业最多的计米面粮业九户，面粉食品业十九户，自行车业二十一户，汽车业十四户。这是人民需要的日常生活和交通工具的行业。这些行业正在发展中。商业局批准歇业的商户最多的是粮栈、绸缎、布业、干果海味等业。其中干果海味是面临淡月，而且也是非民生必需品；绸缎则是奢侈的消费品，过去则多服务于官僚资产阶级和封建阶级的行业，与一般人民生活无关；而粮栈和布业虽为人民所需要，但这些行业在过去大都依靠通货膨胀，囤积居奇，投机倒把，本身资金不多，专用高利（百分之二十七至三十）向私人银号贷款经营，致在三月份物价平稳，竞相倾销下，无法周转而垮台。
