　　The Significance and Methods of Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation
    Di Chaobai
    I. Re-examining Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation with New Perspectives

    To this day, some people in our country are still afraid of the term "economic cooperation" and subconsciously oppose any kind of international economic cooperation. This situation has its historical roots. Due to our long-term subjugation to imperialist aggression, we have long opposed and struggled against schemes such as "Sino-Japanese Economic Collaboration" and "Sino-American Economic Cooperation." These struggles were entirely correct and necessary, and they are deeply etched in the minds of the people. Therefore, when we engage in economic cooperation with the socialist Soviet Union under our own people's government, some people will judge the new reality based on old experiences, confusing the current mutually respectful and mutually beneficial international relations between us and the Soviet Union with the old semi-colonial international relations.

    International economic cooperation based on mutual assistance and mutual benefit is not only not a bad thing, but also an inevitable result of the development of human society's production. However, the "cooperation" we encountered in the past was the "cooperation" between wolves and sheep, the "industrial Japan, agricultural China" type of cooperation, the American boss, Chinese employee type of cooperation; this kind of "cooperation" was not real cooperation, and its result would be that we would be completely reduced to a colony of imperialism, so we had to oppose it, and struggle against it; even today we still have to oppose this kind of "cooperation," and still have to constantly struggle against the American imperialists' attempt to enslave the world. Because, without fighting against this imperialist aggression on a global scale, our independence and peace have no final guarantee. However, just because we want to oppose the hypocritical "economic cooperation" of the imperialists, should we refuse all international economic cooperation, refuse all mutually beneficial international economic cooperation? On the contrary, precisely because we want to oppose the American imperialists' attempt to enslave the world, precisely because the American imperialists are still continuing their military aggression against us through the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit gangs, we must accelerate the process of our country's industrialization, we must strengthen the world's camp of defending peace and democracy, cooperate with the Soviet Union, cooperate with the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and Asia, we must strive to strengthen the world's anti-aggression and peace-defending democratic front, highly develop and consolidate the strength of the people, and create a new life for humanity.

    During the Soviet Union's nation-building process, because it was completely isolated at the time, it had no choice but to bury itself in building socialism in one country. Although Lenin repeatedly pointed out the necessity of allowing the existence of state capitalism with concessions (allowing foreign capitalists' investment), the imperialists' blockade was of little effect. Our situation today is completely different. We are no longer isolated in a state of imperialist encirclement and blockade like the Soviet Union was in those years. Today, half of our borders are surrounded by friendly nations, and more friendly nations are echoing us. Today, if we do not actively strive for beneficial international economic cooperation, and even do not regard this international economic cooperation as one of the main guarantees of the victory of our country's economic construction, this will not only be foolish, but also be a mistake. The result of this mistake will be that our country's economic development will forever lag behind the advanced and backward socialist countries, and become a weak link in the world's peace and democratic camp, which will allow imperialist adventurers to take advantage of the situation.

    II. Several Questions Regarding the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Company Agreements

    Some people are accustomed to judging things from phenomena and forms, which is a kind of empiricism. In the past, imperialists, when invading our country, were deeply afraid of arousing the opposition of the Chinese people, so they particularly embellished the clauses and sentences to make them look good, but in reality they were the most hypocritical. For example, the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce stipulated that citizens of both parties had equal rights to engage in commerce, manufacturing, and religious culture, etc., in the other contracting country. But it is obvious that this provision, on the Chinese side, except for being conducive to the escape of bureaucratic capital, is a kind of satire and harm to the Chinese people. Therefore, it is often a mistake to determine the nature of a treaty from the form of its clauses. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the first to abolish unequal treaties with China and return concessions, while the United States and Britain waited until Japan occupied their concessions before they verbally returned them. However, as soon as Japan surrendered, the American imperialists expanded their concessions in China to the whole of China (through the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, Americans had the freedom to operate, manufacture, reside, preach, travel, etc., throughout China). However, the Soviet Union did not do this. On the contrary, in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and several agreements regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lüshun and Dalian, the Soviet Union returned to our country the rights it had seized from Japanese imperialists. The Soviet Union's long-term friendly actions towards the Chinese people powerfully exposed the appearance of the imperialist hypocrites.

    Regarding the agreements concluded between China and the Soviet Union on surveying and exploiting petroleum and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang, some people have raised the following questions:

    The first question is: Xinjiang is our country's territory, and the Soviet Union comes to jointly develop it with us and shares half of the products. Is this detrimental to us? The key to this question lies here: As long as our national sovereignty is not harmed, as long as both parties enjoy equal benefits (in fact, the benefits we receive are more than the Soviet Union's), this is in line with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The fact that the Soviet Union shares half of the products is beneficial to the Soviet Union's construction; at the same time, we also get half, which is beneficial to our construction. Moreover, we are only investing in land, building materials, etc., and using surplus labor and reserves that do not constitute real wealth to cooperate with the Soviet Union's machinery and technology to develop Xinjiang, establishing modernized industries in backward areas that we cannot achieve with our own strength for the time being. Obviously, this kind of cooperation is entirely beneficial to our country's economic construction.

    The second question is: If capitalist countries also make similar cooperation requests to us, can we agree? The answer to this question hinges on two points: First, whether this kind of cooperation meets our country's construction needs; second, whether the other party in the cooperation is friendly. However, in an era when imperialists are trying to undermine and weaken our economy, it can be predicted that they will not do this.

    The third question is: Why is the cooperation not carried out in the industrial centers of our country, but in remote Xinjiang? This is only because Xinjiang has abundant natural resources that urgently need to be developed; while we ourselves find it difficult to develop the province due to the remoteness of the area and difficulties in transportation.

    III. The Scope and Methods of Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation

    On the one hand, we must "establish and consolidate an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance." At the same time, we must also "unite with all nations and countries in the world that treat us equally."

    Various forms of economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union on the basis of equality and mutual benefit are the concrete implementation of the above policies.

    As human society's production has developed to the current stage, the division of labor has long exceeded national boundaries. No country can retain a completely self-sufficient state within its national boundaries. Currently, there are two types of international division of labor: one is the division of labor between imperialists and their affiliated colonies, which is carried out under a cruel system of exploitation. The other is the equal and mutually beneficial division of labor between the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries within the socialist economic system. The former type of division of labor leads to the development of monopoly capitalism in the suzerain states and wars to seize colonies; the latter type of division of labor will rationally use the unique resources of each country and universally adopt advanced science and technology, and develop the production of each country at the fastest speed based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and lay a material foundation for world permanent peace.

    Economic cooperation resulting from the division of labor within the socialist economic system includes the following methods:

    The first method is trade agreements. The trade agreements we have concluded with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries are entirely based on the needs of our country's economy and are planned barter trade carried out at reasonable prices. It is very different from our old trade with imperialist countries. The old trade did not determine the types of import and export commodities based on the needs of our country's construction, nor did it carry out equivalent exchange based on the production prices of our products. Instead, it was the unilateral needs of the imperialists that determined the types of our imports and exports, and the monopoly prices of the imperialists that determined the prices of the products. Today, our country has controlled the main part of import and export trade, and has transformed the imperialists' exploitative means of colonizing our country into a means for our country to develop its economy with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. This method of cooperation will gradually expand with the upward development of our country's production.

    The second method is loans: This is a way for the advanced socialist Soviet Union to provide economic assistance to the new democratic countries. This kind of loan is not for earning interest, nor is it like the Marshall Plan, which aims to monopolize the market of the loan country and support the reactionary regimes of various countries to organize wars. Instead, it is based on the morality of class brothers, and is a practical assistance to the economic recovery of the new democratic countries after the war. This method cannot be a constantly expanding method; because its significance of assistance is greater than the significance of mutual assistance, and therefore it cannot exceed the repayment ability of the borrowing country (mainly in-kind repayment), otherwise it will not be a loan, but a gift. Giving gifts (unless there are other intentions) is the borrowing country exploiting the lending country, and the Chinese people should not make such demands on the Soviet people.

    The third method is joint stock operations. This method will be implemented in business sectors that need mutual supplementation and mutual assistance in the economic structures of the two countries. For example, the recent agreement between China and the Soviet Union on the development of petroleum and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang combines the Soviet Union's technology and equipment with our country's natural reserves. It is the most effective form of cooperation for the two countries to develop this sector's production based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Through this form of cooperation, the two sides can share what they have and jointly obtain the materials they need. Currently, we import a large amount of petroleum and certain non-ferrous metals from the Soviet Union every year, and at the same time sell some non-ferrous metals such as tungsten, antimony, and tin to the Soviet Union. With the development of our country's industry, the consumption of petroleum and metals will greatly increase, and the export volume of tungsten, antimony, and tin will greatly decrease. Therefore, we need to develop petroleum and non-ferrous metals, on the one hand, to reduce our imports in this regard, and on the other hand, to allow the Soviet Union to purchase the materials it needs (its needs are also increasing year by year). This is the advantage and purpose of joint stock operations.

    The cooperative method of joint stock operations will not only be promoted between China and the Soviet Union, but also between socialist and new democratic countries. Equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between advanced countries and backward countries should be a model. Neither party in this kind of cooperation aims to earn profits, but to develop resources, accelerate industrialization, and improve the people's lives. Since the regimes of both countries are in the hands of the people, and the means of production within the scope of cooperative operations are also owned by the state, neither party will aim to exploit the other party or seek to gain advantages. This is fundamentally different from the investment and development of colonies by imperialists.

　　中苏经济合作的意义及其方式
    狄超白
    一、以新的观点来正视中苏经济合作
    迄今我们国内还有一部分人士，他们怕听“经济合作”这个名词，并且潜意识地反对任何种类的国际经济合作。这一情况是有他的历史根源的，由于我们长期处于帝国主义的侵略之下，我们曾经长期地反对过“中日经济提携”“中美经济合作”之类的勾当，并与之斗争。这些斗争是完全正确的，必要的，这些斗争因而也就深深地刻划在人民的脑子里。因此，当我们在人民自己的政权之下与社会主义的苏联来进行经济合作的时候，有一部分人士就会以旧的经验来评断新的现实，以旧时的半殖民地的国际关系来混同今天我们与苏联之间的相互尊重和相互帮助的国际关系。
    基于互助互利的国际经济合作，不仅不是一件坏事，而且是人类社会生产发展的必然结果。但是我们过去所碰到的“合作”，是狼与羊的“合作”，是“工业日本农业中国”式的合作，是美国老板中国伙计式的合作；这样的“合作”不是真合作，他的结果会使我们完全沦为帝国主义的殖民地，所以我们要反对，要与之斗争；至今我们仍然要反对这种“合作”，仍然要与美帝国主义奴役全世界的企图进行不断的斗争。因为，不在世界范围之内与这种帝国主义的侵略企图作斗争，我们的独立与和平是没有最后的保障的。可是，由于我们要反对帝国主义伪善者的“经济合作”，是不是我们就要拒绝一切国际经济合作，拒绝一切互助互利的国际经济合作呢？刚刚相反，正因为我们要反对美帝国主义奴役全世界的企图，正因为美帝国主义还在通过蒋介石残余匪帮之手继续向我们作军事侵害，我们必须加速我国的工业化过程，我们必须加强世界保卫和平民主的营垒，与苏联合作，与东欧和亚洲的新民主主义国家合作，我们要努力加强世界反侵略的保卫和平民主的阵线，高度发挥与巩固人民的力量，创造人类新的生活。
    苏联在建国过程中由于当时完全处于孤立的地位，所以不得不埋头从事一国建设社会主义，虽然列宁曾再三指出容许租让制的国家资本主义（容许外国资本家的投资）存在的必要，但是由于帝国主义者的封锁收效甚微。我们今天的情形就完全不同了，我们不再像苏联当年那样孤立的处于帝国主义包围封锁状态之下，我们今天有一半的边疆由友邦环抱着，并有更多的友邦在呼应着。今天我们要不积极争取有利的国际经济合作，甚至不把这种国际经济合作当作我国经济建设胜利的主要保证之一，这不仅会是一种愚蠢，而且会是一种错误，这种错误的结果会使我国经济的发展永远落后于先进的和后进的社会主义诸国，并成为世界和平民主营垒中薄弱的一环，将使帝国主义的冒险家有隙可乘。
    二、对于中苏合股公司协定的几个问题
    有一些人是习惯于从现象和形式上判断事物，这是经验主义的一种。在过去，帝国主义者在侵略我国时深恐激起中国人民的反对，所以在条文字句上特别粉饰得好看，实际上是最虚伪的。如中美商约上规定两方国民有同等权利在缔约国对方经营商务制造及宗教文化等等权利。但一望而知，这一规定在中国方面除有利于官僚资本的逃亡而外，对于中国人民乃是一种讽刺，一种损害。所以从条文的形式上去确定条约的性质，往往要犯错误的。苏联在十月革命以后首先废除对中国的不平等条约，交还租界，而美英诸国则一直等到日本占领了她们的租界以后，她们才空言交还，但一等到日本投降以后，美帝国主义者就把她的在华租界扩大至全中国（通过中美商约，美国人在全中国各地有经营、制造、住居、传教、旅行等等的自由）。然而苏联并没有这样做，相反地，中苏友好同盟条约及中长路、旅大的几个协定，苏联把自日本帝国主义者手中夺得的权利归还了我国。苏联对中国人民的长期友好的事实，有力地戳穿帝国主义伪善者的外貌。
    在中苏两国所缔结的勘测和开采新疆石油和有色金属的协定上，有些人提出了下列几个问题：
    第一个问题是：新疆是我国的领土，苏联来和我合股开发，并分得产品的一半，这是否对我不利？这一问题的关键是在这里：只要不损害我国家的主权，只要双方享受同等的利益（事实上我们所得到的利益多于苏联），这就合乎平等互利的原则，产品由苏联分得一半，对苏联的建设有利；同时我们亦得一半，对我建设有利。而且我们只是用地段和建筑材料等作投资，用过剩的劳动力和不成为现实财富的蕴藏，与苏联的机器和技术等合作，来开发新疆，在落后的地区建立我们自己力量一时不能达到的近代化的工业。显然，这种合作对于我国经济建设是有百利而无一害的。
    第二个问题是：假使资本主义的国家也对我提出类似的合作要求，我们能不能同意？这问题的答复系于两点：第一，这种合作是否合乎我国建设的需要；第二，合作的对方是否友善的。然而，在帝国主义者正图破坏和削弱我国经济的今天，可以预料，他们是不会这样做的。
    第三个问题是：为什么不在我国工业中心的地区进行合作，而要在辽远的新疆？这仅仅是因为新疆是具有充足的天然资源而亟需开发；而我们自己则因地区辽远，交通困难，而难于开发的省份。
    三、中苏经济合作的范围及其方式
    我们一方面要“建立及巩固由工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的独立、民主、和平、统一及富强的中华人民共和国。”同时我们还要“联合全世界上以平等待我之民族及国家。”
    中苏两国在平等互利的基础之上进行各种方式的经济合作，是上述方针的具体实施。
    人类社会的生产发展到目前的阶段，分工早已超过了国家的界限，任何一个国家都不再可能保留一种以国家为范围的完全自给自足的状态，目前国际间生产的分工有两种：一种是帝国主义及其附属国殖民地的分工，这种分工是在残酷的剥削制度之下进行的。另一种分工是社会主义经济体系内苏联与新民主主义诸国家间的平等互利的分工。前一种分工造成宗主国独占资本主义的发展和争夺殖民地的战争；后一种分工将合理地使用各国特有的资源和普遍采用先进的科学技术，根据互助互利的原则以最快的速度发展各国生产，并为世界永久和平奠定物质的基础。
    基于社会主义经济体系内的分工而导致的经济合作，约有下列几种方式：
    第一种方式是贸易协定。我们与苏联之间和新民主主义国家间所缔结的贸易协定，是完全根据我国经济的必要，并在合理的价格之下所进行的计划性的易货。它与我国旧时与帝国主义国家间的贸易大有分别。旧时的贸易不是根据我国建设的需要来确定输出入商品的种类的，不是根据我国产品的生产价格来进行等价交换的，而是由帝国主义者的片面需要来确定我国的输出入种类，并由帝国主义者的垄断价格来决定产品的价格的。今天我们国家已控制着主要部分的出入口贸易，已一变帝国主义者殖民地化我国的剥削手段，而为我国与苏联和新民主主义各国间相互发展经济的手段，这一合作方式将随着我国生产的向上发展，会逐步地扩大的。
    第二种方式是贷款：这是社会主义先进的苏联对新民主主义各国实行经济帮助的方式。这种贷款既不是为了赚取利息，也不是像马歇尔计划那样要独占贷款国的市场和支持各国的反动政权组织战争，而是基于阶级兄弟的道义，对新民主主义国家战后经济恢复的实际援助。这种方式不可能是经常的不断扩大的方式；因为它的援助的意义多于互助的意义，因而也不能超过借款国偿付能力（主要的是实物偿付）以外，否则就不是贷款，而成为赠送了。赠送（除非另有企图）是借款国剥削贷款国，中国人民是不应当对苏联人民提出这样的要求的。
    第三种方式是合股经营。这一种方式会施行于两国经济结构中需要相互补充相互协助的事业部门，例如最近中苏两国所订定的开发新疆石油及有色金属的协定，是以苏联的技术设备和我国天然蕴藏相结合，是两国基于平等互利的原则发展这部门生产最有效的合作形式。经过这种形式的合作，双方有无相通，共同取得其所需要的物质。现在我们每年要向苏联购进大量的石油，购进某些有色金属，同时也出卖一些有色金属如钨锑锡之类给苏联，随着我国工业的发展，石油及金属的耗用数量会大大增加的，钨锑锡的输出数量却会大大减少的，所以我们需要开发石油和有色金属，一方面使我们能减少这方面的输入，同时也使苏联购得她所需要的（她的需要也是逐年增大的）物质。这就是合股经营的长处和其目的。
    合股经营的合作方式，不仅会推行于中苏两国之间，而且会推行于社会主义和新民主主义的各国之间。先进国家与后进国家之间的平等互利的经济合作，这应是一种模楷。这种合作的双方都不是以赚取利润为目的，而是以开发资源、加速工业化和改善人民的生活为目的。双方国家的政权既都掌握在人民手里，合作经营范围内的生产资料也都归国家所有，则双方自不会以剥削对方和讨取便宜为目的，这就是与帝国主义者对殖民地投资开发的根本不同之处。
