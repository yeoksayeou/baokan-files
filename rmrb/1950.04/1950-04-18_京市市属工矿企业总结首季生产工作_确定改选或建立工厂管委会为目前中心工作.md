　　Beijing Municipal State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises Summarize First Quarter Production Work
    Determine Re-election or Establishment of Factory Management Committees as Current Central Task
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and State-Owned Enterprise Company, in order to summarize the first quarter production work of this year, inspect the learning of "Learn to Manage Enterprises" and the implementation of democratic management, convened a joint meeting of responsible persons from more than 20 subordinate industrial and mining enterprises on the 13th and 14th of this month. The meeting decided that implementing democratic management and establishing or re-electing factory management committees should be the current central task of each unit.
    After listening to reports from Director of the Industrial Bureau, Mou Zexian, and others on the production situation of municipal state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the first quarter and current issues of democratic management, the responsible persons of each unit, combined with the study of "Learn to Manage Enterprises" and the specific conditions of each factory, conducted in-depth reviews of the implementation of democratic management. First, they criticized the past insufficient understanding of democratic management, such as: some believed that as long as there was a democratic style, it was not necessary to establish a factory management committee; some believed that the workers' awareness was not enough, and it was necessary to wait until the workers had a sense of ownership before a management committee could be established; some believed that democratic management was a "democratic movement" and were afraid of causing trouble if it was not handled well. The meeting unanimously agreed that these incorrect ideas were due to a failure to clearly recognize that democratic management is a basic link in managing enterprises well. Although the vast majority of production work in the first quarter of this year exceeded the plan, in order to advance production further, it is necessary to conscientiously implement democratic management, establish and enrich the organization of the management committee, so that workers can have a sense of ownership, and change from slaves dominated by machines to conscious laborers managing machines. The meeting unanimously agreed that today, the vast majority of municipal state-owned industrial and mining enterprises already have the conditions to establish management committees. The key to running the management committee well lies in, in addition to the leadership of the factory director and the unity of the Party, government, and labor union, being good at using the workers' representative meeting to absorb mass opinions, and then implementing the resolutions of the management committee to the masses, the two should complement each other. After full discussion, the meeting decided to make re-electing or establishing a management committee the current central task. Units that have already established a management committee should first summarize the work since its establishment, and then convene a workers' representative meeting to make a summary report, accept workers' criticisms and suggestions, re-elect management committee members, and establish a new management committee. Units that have not yet established a management committee should first conduct sufficient deliberation and preparation, and convene a workers' representative meeting or a general meeting of workers according to the specific circumstances of each factory to elect management committee members and establish a management committee.

　　京市市属工矿企业总结首季生产工作
    确定改选或建立工厂管委会为目前中心工作
    【京市新闻处讯】京市工业局和公营企业公司为总结本年度第一季生产工作、检查“学会管理企业”的学习和民主管理的执行情形，于本月十三、十四两天召集所属工矿企业二十余单位负责人举行联席会议；会议决定以贯彻民主管理、建立或改选工厂管理委员会为各单位目前中心工作。
    会议在听取了工业局局长牟泽衔等关于市属工矿企业第一季度生产情况和目前民主管理问题的报告后，各单位负责人结合“学会管理企业”的学习和各厂具体情况，对贯彻民主管理工作作了深刻检讨。首先批判了过去存在对民主管理认识不够的思想，比如：有的以为只要有民主作风就可以，不必成立工厂管理委员会；有的认为工人觉悟不够，必须等待工人有了主人翁的感觉后，才能成立管委会；有的认为民主管理就是“民主运动”，怕搞不好出麻烦。会议一致认为这些不正确思想是由于没有明确认识到民主管理是管好企业的基本环节；今年第一季生产工作虽绝大部分超额完成计划，但为了使生产前进一步，必须认真贯彻民主管理，建立、充实管委会的组织，才能使工人有主人翁的感觉，由原来被机器支配的奴隶变成为管理机器的自觉的劳动者。会上一致认为今天市属公营工矿企业已经绝大部分具备建立管委会的条件，搞好管委会的关键在于，除去厂长的领导和党政工的团结外，就是要善于运用职工代表会议，通过代表会议吸取群众意见，然后再把管委会决议贯彻到群众中去，二者要相辅而行。会议经过充分讨论后，决定以改选或建立管委会为目前中心工作，过去已经成立管委会的单位，要先总结成立以来的工作，然后召开职工代表会议作总结报告，接受职工批评和建议，改选管委会委员，成立新的管委会；尚未成立管委会的单位，先进行充分酝酿准备，根据各厂具体情况召开职工代表会议或职工全体会议选举管委会委员，成立管委会。
