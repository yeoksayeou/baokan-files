Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 23rd: The Korean Government's Ministry of Industry held a joint meeting of factory directors and trade union leaders from various regions on the 20th. At the meeting, Deputy Minister of Industry Zheng Yi made a report summarizing the production work in the first quarter of this year. He pointed out that under the sincere assistance of the Soviet government and Soviet technicians, and the correct leadership of the Republic's government, the first quarter's production has exceeded the production plan. For example, the mining sector exceeded the fourth quarter of last year by 2.3 percent, and the chemical sector exceeded it by 5.1 percent. Glass, which North Korea could not produce in the past, has begun to be produced in large quantities since the first quarter of this year. The report concluded by pointing out that after the completion of the two-year people's economic construction plan this year, North Korea's industrial production will exceed the level of 51 percent before liberation in 1945.

In other news: With the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union and the efforts of the workers, in addition to overfulfilling the first quarter's production plans, some factories and mines have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. For example, the Eun-si-ga-mok iron mine in Hwanghae Province, the Sincheon tobacco factory, and the Kimhwa gold mine in Gangwon Province, among others, completed their annual production plans ten months ahead of schedule in February and March.
