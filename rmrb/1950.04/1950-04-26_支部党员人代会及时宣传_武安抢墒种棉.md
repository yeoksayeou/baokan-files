　　Branch Party Members' Congress Promptly Promotes Planting Cotton by Seizing Soil Moisture in Wu'an

    [Our Dispatch] In some villages of Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, branch committees, party members, and people's representatives' congresses promptly promoted planting cotton by seizing soil moisture, putting forward: "Early planting brings prosperity, late planting brings panic." Planting cotton began as early as April 4th. In Xiaohe Village alone, 702 mu of cotton fields were sown, and the cotton seedlings have all emerged. The farmers said: "Following the Communist Party and listening to the representatives will not be wrong." In the third district of Cheng'an, publicity was carried out. Under the leadership of village cadres, party members, and village representatives, cotton planting began on April 3rd. According to statistics from Dianshang, Aishu, and Sunzhuang villages, cotton seedlings have emerged in all 342 mu of cotton fields, and they are growing vigorously. Because the farmers in the village adopted the method of soaking seeds in warm water, they first poured hot water on the selected seeds, then soaked them in cold water for two days, making it easier for the seeds to sprout. This proves the benefits of selecting and soaking seeds, and overcomes the farmers' mentality of relying on the heavens for rain.

　　支部党员人代会及时宣传
    武安抢墒种棉
    【本报讯】河北省邯郸专区武安县部分村庄，支部、党员及人代会及时宣传抢墒种棉，提出：“早种三光、晚种三慌。”四月四日即开始种棉，仅小贺庄就播种了七百零二亩棉田，棉苗已经全部出齐。农民们说：“跟共产党走，听代表的话不会错。”成安三区进行了宣传，在村干、党员、村代表带头下，四月三日开始种棉，据店上、艾束、孙庄等三村的统计，三百四十二亩棉田，全部出了棉苗，长得又旺又好。因为该村农民采用温汤浸种办法，先将选好的种，用热水泼一泼再用凉水泡两天，种上就容易出芽。这证明了选种浸种的好处，又克服了农民靠天等雨思想。
