　　A New Creation in Urban Public Security Work

　　——A Record of the Guangzhou People's Public Security Corps

　　By Our Special Correspondent Xiao Hang

　　On the No. 73 southbound train on the Yuehan Railway, a Western medicine merchant from Hankou spoke to the reporter about the public security situation in Guangzhou. He said: Before liberation, Guangzhou's order was worse than that of other cities. In other cities, thieves steal things from you when you are unaware, which is somewhat based on "skill"; Guangzhou has many thieves who simply "come hard," snatch and run. Talking about the current situation, he repeatedly praised: "A complete change from the old." The merchant couldn't figure out the reason for the progress; the reporter arrived in Guangzhou and found the answer to this question. It turns out that the rapid stabilization of revolutionary order in Guangzhou is inseparable from the merits of the People's Public Security Corps. Tan Zhengwen, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department, gave a high evaluation of the establishment and role of the People's Public Security Corps, considering it a new creation in urban public security work and listing it as the first of Guangzhou's public security work experiences. Now, this experience is being promoted to major and medium-sized cities in South China.

　　Guangzhou was liberated on October 14, 1949. Initially, enemy agents had planned to gather a group of bandits and hooligans who robbed and looted, frightening the entire city several times a night. One day, robbery cases even reached eighty. According to municipal government statistics, a total of 1,592 cases occurred in November, of which robbery accounted for one-third. At first, we didn't even have public security forces. Later, we transferred a very strong public security unit, but they didn't understand Cantonese. Once, the team members were patrolling the streets when they encountered bandits intercepting a woman. The two were arguing, "Urging wa la." The team members didn't know what was going on and mistakenly thought it was a couple fighting. Such a public security force had certain difficulties performing duties in Guangzhou. Therefore, establishing a high-quality public security force that was familiar with the situation, understood the business, and could speak Cantonese became an important issue for the public security authorities. Everything else was easy to handle, but the "understanding of Cantonese" requirement was really not easy to achieve for a while. However, we finally found a way, which was to establish workers', students', and citizens' People's Public Security Corps.

　　The establishment of the People's Public Security Corps began in Guangzhou's Taiping District. This is the most complex and commercially prosperous area. After repeated mobilizations, the masses gradually changed their thinking of simply relying on the government and were willing to organize themselves to improve social order and protect their own peace. As a result, a group of activists grew up, and the government then used them to deepen the mobilization work. In November 1949, the first People's Public Security Corps was established. The public security authorities summarized the experience of this key area, and after extensive discussions by relevant departments, formulated a draft of the organizational regulations of the People's Public Security Corps and gradually promoted this experience to various factories, schools, and urban areas. The method was still a key breakthrough. For example, in the Dongdi District, Wanfu Road, where order was most chaotic and robbery cases were most frequent, was the focus, and the results were very good. In areas where the People's Public Security Corps was established, robbery cases no longer occurred. As of early March, the city's People's Public Security Corps had become a mass-based and powerful public security organization, with 32 factory units with more than 700 people, 4 school units with more than 200 people, and 28 urban units with more than 5,000 people, totaling more than 6,000 people. They were divided into regular teams and reserve teams. The regular teams were all citizens, detached from production, receiving certain allowances, and working the same hours as the police, responsible for patrolling, guarding, and assisting in the search and arrest of bandits. The reserve teams were not detached from production, did not receive allowances, and the government provided appropriate subsidies when work was needed. Their duties were to assist in patrols, informers, liaison, and so on. The captains and other cadres of each team were all elected by the team members, and then the Public Security Bureau gathered them for short-term training. For the convenience of performing their duties, the Public Security Bureau focused on factories and business departments and equipped them with weapons.

　　This powerful mass public security organization shoulders heavy responsibilities and holds weapons in its hands. Therefore, strictly reviewing the composition of the team members has become an extremely important task. From the beginning, the government determined that each district should be based on workers, handicraft workers, shop assistants, and farmers, and absorb small vendors, staff members, and poor intellectuals to participate. There were two ways to absorb team members: voluntary participation and recruitment. All team members must have the conditions of being upright in style, having a clean history, being loyal and reliable, and being able to connect with the masses. After the teams were formed, the Public Security Bureau also used various methods to understand each team member, such as conducting individual conversations with the cadres and team members sent, studying their autobiographies, investigating from the masses, and testing them in their work. There were also some problems in the work, such as some districts using a half-assigned mandatory method to force the masses to participate in the People's Public Security Corps, so some team members were hired to fill the numbers, which of course did not work. Another example is that the district-level leading cadres of Dexuan District did not personally grasp this matter, but completely pushed the work of reviewing the composition to the lower-level cadres, which resulted in some problems. A former Kuomintang army regimental commander also mixed in. Fortunately, these shortcomings were corrected in a timely manner. In general, the organization of the People's Public Security Corps is pure.

　　With the help of the People's Public Security Corps, Guangzhou's public security work has made commendable progress, and cases have decreased sharply. According to municipal government statistics, a total of 920 cases occurred in December last year, a decrease of 56% compared to the 1,592 cases in November. Among them, robbery accounted for 317 cases, a decrease of 60% compared to the 514 cases in November. And while 18 missing person cases occurred in November, no cases occurred in December. As of late March, only an average of two or three cases occurred in the city every day. Of course, this achievement is the result of the efforts of all public security personnel and cannot be entirely attributed to the People's Public Security Corps; however, the role played by the People's Public Security Corps in this is very large. Some team members captured bandits with their bare hands, and some team members were injured while performing their glorious tasks. Therefore, in just four months, they have solved 415 cases and seized some guns and ammunition. In fact, they have played a role like that of rural militias.

　　According to Tan Zhengwen's estimate, the current public security in Guangzhou cannot be said to be consolidated, only stable, because the special agents and bandits have not suffered a fatal blow. Guangzhou is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau and is at the forefront of the struggle against Kuomintang and imperialist special agents. The struggle is still going on intensely, and the tasks of the People's Public Security Corps are becoming heavier and heavier. Guangzhou's public security authorities are planning to further improve the organization of the People's Public Security Corps and improve its quality. Once conditions are ripe, they will promote the most conscious part of them to the regular public security forces, so as to more effectively protect the safety of the city's people.

　　城市公安工作的新创造
    ——记广州市的人民纠察队
    本报特派记者  萧航
    在粤汉路七十三次南下列车上，一位汉口的西药商向记者谈起广州的治安情况。他说：解放以前，广州秩序之坏，为其他城市所少见。在别的城市里，小偷乘你不知不觉时，把东西偷走，这多少还凭点“技术”；广州有不少小偷简直是“硬来”，抢了就跑。谈到现在的情况，他连声赞叹：“一改旧观”。这个商人弄不清进步的原因是什么；记者到了广州，才找到了这个问题的答案。原来广州革命秩序的迅速趋于安定，和人民纠察队的功绩是分不开的。对于人民纠察队的建立及其作用，广东省公安厅谭政文厅长曾给予了很高的估价，认为这是城市公安工作的新创造，把它列为广州市公安工作经验的第一条。现在，这条经验正向华南各大中城市推广。
    广州是一九四九年十月十四日解放的。最初，敌特有计划地纠集了一批土匪、流氓，横抢硬劫，全市一夕数惊，有一天，抢案竟达到八十件。据市政府统计，十一月份内，共发生一千五百九十二件案子，其中抢案占了三分之一。我们开头连公安武装也没有，后来调到一支很强的公安部队，但不懂得广东话。有一次，队员们在街上巡逻，适逢土匪拦劫一个妇女，两个人嘴里“乌里哇喇”，争争吵吵。队员们不晓得这是怎么一回事情，误以为两夫妇打架。这样的公安部队在广州执行职务，有着一定的困难。于是，建立一支质量较好，熟悉情况，懂得业务，会说广东话的公安武装，便成为公安当局考虑的重要课题。别的还好办，“懂得粤语”这一条，一时实在不大容易作到。但是，我们终于找到了一条途径，这就是建立工人的、学生的、市民的人民纠察队。
    人民纠察队的建立，开始于广州市的太平区。这是居民最复杂、商业最繁盛的一个地区。经过了三番五次的动员，群众逐渐改变了单纯依靠政府的思想，愿意自己组织起来，搞好社会秩序，保卫自己的安宁，于是有一批积极分子生长了起来，政府遂通过他们，把动员工作又深入了一步。这样，一九四九年十一月，第一支人民纠察队建立起来了。公安当局总结了这个重点区的经验，又经过有关部门的广泛讨论，拟订出人民纠察队组织章程草案，逐步向各工厂、学校、市区推广这一经验。办法依然是重点突破。比如在东堤区，就以秩序最乱、抢案最多的万福路为重点，实行结果甚好。人民纠察队建立的地区，抢案便没有再发生过。到三月初为止，全市的人民纠察队，已经成为群众性的强大的治安组织，计工厂三十二个单位七百余人，学校四个单位二百余人，市区二十八个单位五千余人共六千余人。他们分编为常备队和后备队。常备队全是市民，脱离生产，领有一定的津贴，作息时间和警察同，负责巡逻，站岗，协助搜捕匪徒等职务。后备队不脱离生产，没有津贴，工作需要的时候，政府给予适当的补助。他们的职务是协助巡逻，密告，联络等等。各队的中队长等干部全是队员选举的，又由公安局集中起来进行了短期训练。为了执行职务的方便，公安局以工厂与企业部门为重点，给他们配备了武器。
    这个强大的群众治安组织，肩负着繁重的任务，手里掌握着武器，因此，严密地审查队员的成份，便成为一项极其重要的工作。政府一开始就确定各区以工人、手工业工人、店员、农民为基础，吸收小摊贩、职员以及贫苦知识分子参加。吸收队员的方式有两种：自愿参加和招收。一切队员均须具备作风正派、历史清白、忠诚可靠、能联系群众等条件。编队之后，公安局又采用各种方式了解每个队员，如通过派去的干部和队员进行个别谈话，研究他们的自传，从群众中调查，在工作中考验等等。在工作中也出过一些毛病，如有的区曾用过半摊派的强制方式，硬让群众参加人民纠察队，因而有的队员是被雇来顶数的，当然起不了作用。再如德宣区的区级领导干部没有亲自掌握这件事情，而是把审查成份的工作完全推给下层干部，结果发生了一些问题，有一个前国民党军的团长也混进来了。好在这些缺点纠正得很及时，总的来说，人民纠察队的组织是纯洁的。
    借助于人民纠察队的力量，广州市的治安工作有了可称赞的进步，案件急剧减少。据市府统计，去年十二月份共发生案件九百二十件，较之十一月份的一千五百九十二件减少百分之五十六。其中抢案占三百一十七件，较十一月份的五百一十四件，减少百分之六十。而十一月份曾发生失踪案十八件，十二月份则一件也没有发生。到三月下旬为止，全市每日发生的案件仅平均两三件了。当然，这个成绩是全体公安人员努力的结果，不能完全归功于人民纠察队；但是人民纠察队在这中间所起的作用，是很大的。有的队员徒手捉土匪，有的队员在执行光荣的任务中负了伤。因此，在短短的四个月中，他们就破获了四百一十五件案子，并缴获了一部分枪支和弹药。事实上，他们已经起了如同农村民兵那样的作用。
    按照谭政文厅长的估计，目前广州市的治安还说不上巩固，只能说是稳定，因为特务土匪还没有遭受致命的打击。广州毗邻香港、澳门，是和国民党以及帝国主义特务作斗争的尖端。斗争还正在紧张地进行着，人民纠察队的任务也愈来愈重。广州的公安当局正计划进一步健全人民纠察队的组织，提高其素质，一待条件成熟，就把其中觉悟最高的一部分提升为正规的公安武装，使之更有效地保卫全市人民的安全。
