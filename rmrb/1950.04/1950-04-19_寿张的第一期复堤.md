　　The First Phase of Dyke Restoration in Shou Zhang

　　The first phase of dike restoration along the Yellow River in Shou Zhang has been completed. Shou Zhang, drawing on past experience in dike restoration, formulated a plan based on local conditions and organized the preparatory work. After the laborers went to the dike, they systematically mastered the working procedures, and the laborers' morale was high. As a result, the dike construction progressed with high efficiency and quality, achieving the goal of combining disaster relief. On March 1st, the county held a mobilization and preparation meeting for dike restoration. The meeting, based on the goal of combining dike restoration with disaster relief, concluded that this year's early start on dike restoration and the presence of water at most dike roots prevented simultaneous construction, while the number of disaster victims requesting to participate in dike restoration was too large to employ all at once. Therefore, it was decided to carry out the project in four phases. The first phase prioritized employing disaster victims from severely affected areas. For example, District Three, being a severely affected area, contributed the most workers, with 1,600 people assigned. District One, being a less affected area, contributed 650 people, and District Two, with some villages affected, contributed only 200 people, for a total of 2,450 people. However, since the quality of tamping directly affected the firmness of the dike, it was decided that tamping workers should be selected based on skill rather than disaster severity. For example, although District Three was a severely affected area, it was not allowed to provide tamping workers due to their poor tamping skills. Although only some villages in District Two were affected, many were skilled in tamping, so it was decided to allow villages like Guanmenkou, Lianhuachi, and Mikou to provide more tamping workers. After the meeting, adhering to the principle of not starting work without adequate preparation, the assigned tasks were carefully inspected. Checks were made to ensure the combination of natural villages and administrative villages, the availability of tools for semi-able-bodied laborers, the adequacy and suitability of tools, and the preparation of food and firewood. To take care of the disaster victims' livelihoods, when distributing initial rations, although a Yellow River warehouse had been established last year, it was far from the construction site. Therefore, two temporary warehouses were established at Miaokou and Houzhang, and a small warehouse was set up at Liuqiao, the village where the repair and defense section was stationed, to facilitate the disbursement of miscellaneous wages at any time. At the same time, in the sections of the dike where construction was decided, such as Bailou, Liuqiao, and Yingtang, boundary stakes were set up in two days, marking the village names. Workers sent representatives to recognize their work areas and find accommodation. In waterlogged sections, bridges were prepared. After the workers started, bridges were immediately built, and designated soil borrowing pits were assigned. These preparatory works took more than ten days, and construction did not start until the 13th.

　　After the project began, in order to improve the project's efficiency and quality, attention was focused on mastering the skills of shovel workers and tamping workers. The past practice of having shovel workers both level the transported soil and do pushing work, resulting in uneven leveling and each soil layer exceeding four centimeters, making it difficult to tamp firmly, was corrected. It was stipulated that shovel workers should not do pushing work but should concentrate on mastering the specified thickness of each soil layer, specifically leveling the transported soil for convenient and firm tamping. Repeated inspections were carried out, such as the shape and dimensions of the soil ponds, the thickness of the soil layers, and the integration of new and old soil, with measurements and records taken regularly, and meetings held for timely praise and criticism. In the past, dike restoration was mostly organized by natural villages, with small villages and fragmented work sections. In addition, the junctions between village work sections were often poorly done and not tamped firmly, making them prone to leaks during floods. Therefore, this lesson was learned, and the practice of organizing by village was broken, with small villages of fewer than thirty people merged to overcome the fragmentation of work sections. To ensure the firmness of the junctions between work sections, cadres were instructed to encourage the earthworkers from both villages to pour more soil towards the junctions. At the same time, the number of cadres was increased to strengthen the leadership of the tamping workers. Those tamping rammers weighing less than 60 jin had their wage grade reduced. For example, the tamping at Guanlu was good, but the rammer weighed less than 60 jin. To praise their skill and enthusiasm, they were given a red flag, but their wages were set at the second grade. Mastering the tamping technique to ensure that the rammer was lifted immediately after landing, using a three-hit method once, a two-hit method once, with the rammer lifted to about 2.5 meters high, and ensuring that each 4 cm thick layer of soil was tamped down to 3 cm. Timely praise was given to those who met the requirements to stimulate competitive spirit. As a result, not only was the firmness of the dike construction higher than in any previous year, but also the efficiency exceeded that of the past and this year's requirements. The original general requirement was for each tamping team to tamp about 90 cubic meters of soil per day, but the actual overall average was 103.592 cubic meters. Many tamping teams were able to tamp 110 to 120 cubic meters.

　　A total of 127 villages participated in the first phase of dike restoration. On the 5,150-meter-long dike line, a total of 83,326.57 cubic meters of soil were moved, employing a total of 27,753 workers. A total of 212,263.57 jin of rice was spent. The mixed average for full and semi-able-bodied laborers was 3.002 cubic meters of soil per worker, with an average wage of 7.648 jin of rice per worker. The most efficient village, Lu Pi Jiang Village, with a soil transportation distance of 170 meters (soil volume increased for transport distances over 100 meters), moved 4.18 cubic meters of soil per worker, with an average wage of 15.2 jin of rice per worker. In the overall average, if all were counted as full laborers, the efficiency would be much greater than three cubic meters. According to the statistics of Yu Huang Miao, Han Na Li, Xu Ling and other three villages, the daily living expenses for each earthworker averaged 5.59 jin of corn, equivalent to 4.4 jin of rice. After deducting living expenses, the most rice remaining per worker was 4.72 jin, and the least was 2.96 jin, with each worker able to support three to five disaster victims. The tamping workers used a total of 6,435 workers, spending a total of 36,744 jin of rice. The overall average wage for each grade of tamping worker was 5.71 jin of rice, with each worker able to support two or three disaster victims with the remaining rice. From this, it can be seen that the first phase of dike restoration in Shou Zhang, thanks to thorough preparation and strong and effective organization and leadership, on the one hand, improved the efficiency and quality of the project, exceeding the overall requirement of three cubic meters; on the other hand, the disaster victims had food and income, saving a large number of disaster victims, and achieving the goal of combining disaster relief.

　　寿张的第一期复堤
    君谦
    寿张第一期复临黄堤，已告完成。寿张由于接受了历年复堤经验，根据当地具体情况制定计划，有组织的进行了准备工作。民工上堤后，有步骤的掌握工作环节，民工情绪好，结果修堤工程的进行，效率与质量均高，达到了结合救灾的目的。该县在三月一日召开了复堤动员与准备会议，会议上根据复堤结合救灾目的，认为今年复堤动工早，而堤根大多有水，不能普遍同时动工，而灾民要求参加复堤的人数很多，不能同时都收用。遂决定工程分四期进行。第一期民工尽先让重灾区灾民做，如三区是重灾区出人最多，布置了一千六百人，一区是较轻灾区出六百五十人，二区部分村有灾情，只出二百人，共二千四百五十人。但因硪工的好坏，对堤工的坚实程度有直接关系，就决定硪工以技术为主，而不迁就灾情。如三区虽是重灾区，因硪工技术不好，就不让该区出硪工。二区虽只部分村有灾情，却长于打硪的多，就决定让关门口、莲花池、米口等村多出硪工。会议后，本着准备不好就不动工的精神，认真根据布置的工作进行检查。检查自然村和行政村是否结合，半劳力是否有工具，工具是否够用和适用，粮食及烧柴是否准备好了等。为了照顾灾民生活，发垫底粮时，因为去年虽已建立了黄河仓库，但仓库距施工地点远，遂又在苗口和后张建立了两个临时仓库，并在修防段驻村刘桥设了一个小仓库，以便随时开支零星工资。同时在决定施工的白楼、刘桥、影塘等堤段，以两天的时间按置边桩，标明村名，工人派代表认工，找住宿地点；在有水的工段，准备架桥。工人上工后，即进行架桥，并指定取土的方坑。这些准备工作进行了十多天，直到十三日才开工。
    工程开始后，为了提高工程的效率和质量，就抓紧了掌握土工的边锨和硪工。纠正过去边锨既负责平治运上去的土，又兼做推土工作，致土平的不平，每坯土超过四公寸，打不结实等现象。规定边锨不做推土工作，集中力量掌握每坯土规定的厚度，专门平治运上去的土，以便打硪方便，打得结实。并且进行反复检查，如土塘的样式和尺寸，坯土的厚度，新旧土的结合等，随时测量登记，及时开会表扬与批评。过去复堤时，大多以自然村为单位，小村多，工段分的零碎，加以村与村的工段结合部，常做不好，打不结实，洪水来时易于出漏洞。遂接受这一教训，打破以村为单位的办法，凡三十人以下的小村实行合并，克服了工段零碎现象。并为了做到工段结合部的坚实，使两村土工主动往结合部多倒点土。同时增加干部，加强对硪工的领导，凡硪的重量在六十斤以下的，降低其工资等级。如官路的硪打的好，但硪不够六十斤，为了表扬他们的技术和积极性给他们挂了红，可是工资却定为二等。掌握硪工确实做到快号落地即起的硪，套三打法一遍，套二打法一遍，硪举到二公尺半左右高，做到每坯四公寸厚的土，打得剩三公寸厚。及时表扬合乎要求的，以刺激竞赛情绪。因此不但堤工的坚实程度超过了过去任何一年，即效率也超过了过去，和超过了今年的要求。原来总要求，每盘硪每天打九十左右立方公尺土，结果则做到了总平均一○三·五九二立方公尺。有许多硪还能打到一百一十至一百二十立方公尺。
    参加第一期复堤的村共有一二七个，在五一五○公尺长的堤线上，共做土八三三二六·五七立方公尺，共用土工二七七五三个，共开支米二一二二六三·五七斤，整劳力与半劳力混合平均每工合土三·○○二立方公尺，平均每工得工资米七·六四八斤。效率最高的吕皮匠村，运土距离一七○公尺（运土距离超过百公尺的加土方），每工合土四·一八立方公尺，平均每工得米十五·二斤。在总平均数中，如全以整劳力计，则效率还要大大超过三方。根据玉皇庙、韩那里、徐岭等三个村的统计，土工每天的生活开支费，每工合玉米五·五九斤，折合米四·四斤，每工除了生活开支费，结余米最多的为四·七二斤，少的也结余米二·九六斤，每工可养活灾民三至五人。硪工共用六四三五个，共开支米三六七四四斤，各等硪工工资总平均每工得米五·七一斤，每工结余米也可养活灾民二、三人。由此看来，寿张的第一期复堤工程，由于准备充分，组织领导强而有力，一方面提高了工程效率和质量，超过了三公方的总要求；一方面灾民有吃有得，挽救了大批灾民，达到了结合救灾的目的。
