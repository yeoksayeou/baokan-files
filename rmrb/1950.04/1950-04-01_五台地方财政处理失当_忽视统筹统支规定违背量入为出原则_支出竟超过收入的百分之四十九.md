　　Mishandling of Local Finances in Wutai
    Disregard for Unified Revenue and Expenditure Regulations, Violation of the Principle of Living Within One's Means
    Expenditures Exceeding Income by 49 Percent
    [By our reporter] According to a notification from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government: Wutai County in Shanxi Province, due to insufficient understanding of unified local financial revenue and expenditure and failure to grasp the principle of living within its means, resulted in last year's local grain expenditure exceeding the total income by 49 percent. The county's local financial income last year included agricultural tax surcharge of 1,275,144 jin of millet and industrial and commercial tax surcharge equivalent to 10,500 jin of millet, totaling 1,285,644 jin of millet. However, the expenditure on education alone reached 1,700,375 jin of millet, exceeding the total income by 33.24 percent; adding construction expenses, support for military dependents and relief, village expenses, conference expenses, land reform cadre expenses, and other expenditures for city defense, militia, village cadre training, postal services, and prisoner rations, the total annual expenditure reached 1,920,339 jin, resulting in a net deficit of more than 634,000 jin of millet.
    An investigation by higher authorities revealed that the main reasons for the deficit were: First, there was insufficient understanding of the regulations for unified local financial revenue and expenditure at the county level, and there was a serious reliance on subsidies. The provision that appropriate adjustments could be made within the special district when necessary was regarded as an unlimited source of meeting needs, with the assumption that higher authorities would provide subsidies after expenses were incurred. Second, the basic principle that local finances should live within their means was not grasped. When income was insufficient, expenses were not appropriately reduced, and unnecessary expenses were also covered by local grain expenditure. For example, more than 64,000 jin were spent on land reform cadre expenses and prisoner rations. Third, needs were not well adapted to actual affordability. This was mainly reflected in education expenses, which accounted for 133.25 percent of total income. This clearly exceeded the county's actual affordability. For example, 125 primary school teachers in the county were receiving Class A treatment, with a monthly salary of 180 jin per person, which did not comply with the standards stipulated by the former North China People's Government (this has now been rectified, and only twelve teachers in the county retain Class A treatment). In addition, the salaries of support staff were supposed to be 110 jin to 150 jin according to the former North China People's Government regulations, but the county uniformly paid 140 jin (county high school) and 150 jin (normal school). Moreover, it had been stipulated that the salaries of support staff at the county high school and normal school should be paid only from the date of arrival to the date of departure, but the county paid full-year salaries. As a result, more than 100,000 jin of grain were overspent in education expenses due to the overall increase in the grade of faculty and staff and the payment of full-year salaries to support staff during holidays.
    The Shanxi Provincial People's Government therefore issued a notice to all special districts and counties in late December of last year, urging them to pay close attention to doing a good job in local financial work and preventing similar situations from occurring.

　　五台地方财政处理失当
    忽视统筹统支规定违背量入为出原则
    支出竟超过收入的百分之四十九
    【本报讯】据山西省人民政府通报消息：山西五台县由于对地方财政统筹统支认识不足及未能掌握量入为出原则，致去年地方粮支出超过全部收入的百分之四十九。该县去年地方财政收入计农业税附加小米一、二七五、一四四斤，工商税收附加折米一○、五○○斤，共收入小米一、二八五、六四四斤。而支出中仅教育费一项开支即达小米一、七○○、三七五斤，超过全部收入的百分之三三·二四；加上建设费、优军救济、村经费、会议费、土改干部费及其他城防、民兵、村干训练、邮务、囚粮等支出，全年开支即达一、九二○、三三九斤，收支相抵，净亏小米六十三万四千余斤。
    经上级派员调查结果，其亏空主要原因系在于：一、对实行县地方财政统筹统支的规定认识不够，存在着严重的依赖补助观点，把规定专区范围内必要时可作适当调剂当成无限制满足需要的来源，以为开支后上级可以补助。二、未能掌握地方财政应量入为出的基本原则。收入不足时亦未适当紧缩开支，同时还将应减少或不必要的开支也由地方粮支出。如土地改革干部费及囚粮等共开支六万四千多斤。三、需要与实际负担能力未能很好地适应。这主要表现在教育经费方面，其支出达全部收入的百分之一三三·二五，很明显地，这是超越该县实际负担能力的。如全县小学教员即有一二五人是甲等待遇，每人每月薪金一八○斤，这与前华北人民政府的规定标准是不符合的（现已整顿，全县仅留十二个甲等待遇）。又公杂人员薪金，照前华北人民政府规定应为一一○斤到一五○斤，但该县却一律以一四○斤（县高）和一五○斤（师范）开支。而且，本来县高、县师公杂人员计薪早经规定系按到、离校之日起止支给，而该县却一律发全年薪。致使在教育经费中，由于全体教职员提高等级与公杂人员假期支薪全年即多开支粮食十万斤以上。
    山西省人民政府为此，曾于去年十二月下旬通报各专县，切实注意做好地方财政工作，防止类似情形发生。
