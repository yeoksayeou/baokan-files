　　The Government of the Seventeen Districts of Beijing Suburbs Helps Disaster Victims Return to Their Hometowns for Production
    [Our Newspaper] To help disaster victims return to their hometowns, the government of the seventeen districts of Beijing suburbs has been sending them back. Starting from the last lunar December of last year, disaster victims from counties such as Sanhe and Baodi have arrived in the seventeen districts one after another. In order to better resettle the disaster victims and help them engage in production, the district government accommodated them in various branch offices on the 28th of last month, totaling thirty-three households and ninety-five people. After soliciting their opinions separately, most were willing to return home, but they lacked travel expenses. The district government immediately decided to advance a portion from the district relief grain, issuing a subsidy of one and a half jin of millet per person per day for travel expenses. Twenty-seven households with seventy-four people decided to return home, and six households with twenty-one people were willing to go to Chahar and Suiyuan for production. Those returning home set off on the 31st. (Seventeen District Government Secretariat)

　　京郊十七区政府帮助灾胞回籍生产
    【本报讯】京郊十七区政府遣送灾胞回籍。从去年旧历腊月开始，三河、宝坻等县的灾胞曾陆续到达十七区。该区政府为更好安置灾胞，进行生产，上月二十八日将他们收容于各分驻所，共三十三户、九十五人。分别征求他们的意见，大部愿意回家，只是路费短少。区政府当即决定由区救济粮中垫支一部，每人每日按斤半小米发给补助路费。有二十七户七十四人决定回家，六户二十一人愿往察绥生产。回家的已于三十一日启程。（十七区政府秘书室）
