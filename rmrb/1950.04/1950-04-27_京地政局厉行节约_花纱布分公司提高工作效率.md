[Beijing News Agency News] The Municipal Land Administration Bureau previously lacked awareness of institutional thrift and production, its expenditure system was not strict, and it wasted a lot, with monthly expenses being insufficient. Since launching study and discussions on thrift and production in March, with Director Liu of the bureau taking the lead in thrift, and carefully studying the general affairs section's expenditure budget, in March, in addition to making up for the previous months' deficits, there was a surplus of 300 jin of millet. After achieving results in thrift, the bureau further developed production work and formed a thrift and production committee. Under the leadership of the thrift and production committee, each office, section, team, and unit of the bureau made precise expenditure budgets, which were sent to the director for review. Starting in April, it is estimated that 540 jin of millet can be saved each month, and 4,800 jin of millet, equivalent to one month's expenses, can be saved in the nine months until the end of the year. The general affairs section specifically controls the budget approved by the director and distributes it to each department, not only not exceeding the budget, but also having surpluses. In terms of production, the thrift and production committee has established seventeen production groups, each group formulating a plan; two days of spare time a week are designated as production time. Currently, the women's group has begun sewing instrument pockets and dismantling and washing public quilts. Several groups are preparing to contract flat measurement work from Yongmao Company, working on Sundays, and are currently drawing up contracts. The workers are also preparing to transport grain. In total, more than two hundred employees can complete a production task of 1,200 jin of millet.

[Reported by this newspaper] Each unit of the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company improves work efficiency and saves costs. The branch company's production support unit's finishing team previously consisted of two groups with a total of ten people, finishing more than 300 bolts of cloth per day; now one group finishes 450 bolts of cloth per day, and can properly store the cut-off cloth scraps, both large and small, for sale. The packaging team previously had three machines, packaging 150 pieces per day; now with only two machines, it packages 170 pieces per day. They also use old rope ends, saving raw materials. The storage unit picked out more than 100 jin of old rope ends from the warehouse for packaging, saving more than 500 jin of millet. The two comrades in charge of distributing yarn dismantle packages by hand instead of using scissors. The saved materials are equivalent to more than 600 jin of millet. The transportation unit handles the procedures personally when transporting yarn and cloth, saving more than 2,300 jin of millet.
