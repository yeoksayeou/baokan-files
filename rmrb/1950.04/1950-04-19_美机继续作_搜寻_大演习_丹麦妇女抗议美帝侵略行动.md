Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch: TASS, Copenhagen, Sixteenth Dispatch: The Danish Democratic Women's Organization, affiliated with the Women's International Democratic Federation, recently passed a resolution protesting the transformation of Copenhagen Airport into a base for US bombers. The resolution stated: "We strongly protest the large number of American military aircraft landing at Copenhagen Airport, and we also oppose the Americans considering our country as their base."

Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch: TASS, Copenhagen, Sixteenth Dispatch: The US Air Force's large-scale maneuvers, taking off from Denmark's Kastrup Airport, are continuing with redoubled effort. Authorities strictly forbid local photographers from taking pictures of American aircraft. Both Kastrup Airport and the American Flying Fortresses are guarded by Danish police. The guard force is especially strong for aircraft equipped with the latest airborne photographic equipment with high-intensity telephoto lenses.

In Denmark, few people believe that the United States is here to search for missing aircraft. The general opinion here is that the US Air Force's actions in the Baltic Sea area are intended to intimidate Danes and Swedes. It is generally believed that this show of force is deemed necessary by the Americans because of Denmark's increasing tendency to move away from the Atlantic Pact, and because of the United States' increasing attempt to encircle Sweden in its aggressive plans.

　　美机继续作“搜寻”大演习
    丹麦妇女抗议美帝侵略行动
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根十六日讯：国际民主妇女联合会所属丹麦民主妇女组织顷通过决议，抗议变哥本哈根机场为美国轰炸机的基地。决议略称：“我们强力抗议大量美国军用飞机降落在哥本哈根机场，我们也反对美国人认为我国是他们的基地”。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根十六日讯：自丹麦加斯特鲁普机场起飞的美空军大演习，仍在加倍努力地进行中。当局严禁本市摄影师摄取美国飞机照片。加斯特鲁普机场和美国空中堡垒，都有丹麦警察守卫。对装有强度电传摄影镜头的最新式空中摄影设备的飞机，守卫兵力特强。
    在丹麦，很少人相信美国是为了寻找失踪飞机而来的。此间一般的意见认为：美空军在波罗的海区域的行动，用意是要恐吓丹麦人和瑞典人。一般相信：由于丹麦之日益趋向脱离大西洋公约，又由于美国之日益企图将瑞典圈进其侵略计划，这一次武力示威，在美国人看来是需要的。
