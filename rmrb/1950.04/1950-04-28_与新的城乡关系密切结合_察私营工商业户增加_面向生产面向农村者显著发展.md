Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, April 27th: In the past year, private industry and commerce in Chahar Province have achieved significant development along the path of being oriented towards production and the countryside. According to statistics, the number of industrial and commercial households in the province has increased by 32.5% compared to a year ago, and the number of people engaged in industry and commerce has increased by 47.4%. The development of industry and handicrafts is the most significant. For example, in Zhangjiakou, the number of machine industry households has increased by 104% in the past year, and the number of people has increased by 272%; the number of handicraft households has also increased by about 60%, and the number of people has increased by 112%. Due to the development of industry, the number of commercial households has also increased by 45.4%, but the number of people has only increased by 38.8%. This development is closely integrated with the trend of new urban-rural relations. In Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the most prominent developments in the past year have been in tool manufacturing, agricultural product processing, and local product trading. The number of tool manufacturing households has increased by 5.6%, but the number of people has increased by 76.6%; the number of agricultural product processing households has increased by 65.4%, and the number of people has increased by 78.6%; the number of local product trading households has increased by 112%, and the number of people has increased by 56.5%. Industries that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, such as iron casting, leather making, and flour milling, have exceeded the level during the Kuomintang rule in 1948 by half to one and a half times. In contrast to the above development, some industries have declined. For example, all ten silver shops originally in Zhangjiakou have closed down, and others such as incense and head oil have disappeared completely.

　　与新的城乡关系密切结合
    察私营工商业户增加
    面向生产面向农村者显著发展
    【新华社张家口二十七日电】最近一年来，察哈尔省的私营工商业沿着面向生产、面向农村的道路已获得显著发展。据统计，全省工商业户较一年前增加了百分之三十二点五，工商业人数则增加了百分之四十七点四。其中工业和手工业的发展最为显著。如张家口机器工业户数一年来增加了百分之一百零四，人数增加了百分之二百七十二；手工业户数亦增加了约百分之六十，人数则增加了百分之一百一十二。由于工业的发展商业户数也增加百分之四十五点四，人数仅增加百分之三十八点八。这种发展是和新的城乡关系的趋势密切结合着的。张家口、宣化两市，一年来发展最突出的是工具制造业、农产品加工业和土产贩运业。工具制造业户增加了百分之五点六，人数即增加了百分之七十六点六；农产品加工业户数增加了百分之六十五点四，人数增加了百分之七十八点六；土产品贩运业户数则增加了百分之一百一十二，人数增加了百分之五十六点五。有利国民生计的行业如铸铁、制革、面粉等均超过一九四八年国民党统治时期的水平半倍至一倍半以上。与上述发展情况相反，有些行业已走向没落。如张家口原有的十户银钱业已全部歇业，其他如神香、脑油等则均已绝迹。
