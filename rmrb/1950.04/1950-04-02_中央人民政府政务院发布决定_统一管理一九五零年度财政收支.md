　　In order to overcome the imbalance in national fiscal revenue and expenditure and the disconnection of revenue and expenditure organs, to conserve expenditures, rectify revenue, and unify the management of national fiscal revenue and expenditure, the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government hereby makes the following decisions:

　　1. National finance is unified under the Central People's Government: Tax systems, fiscal revenue and expenditure procedures, supply wage standards, administrative personnel establishment, and the national general budget and final accounts shall be formulated or compiled uniformly by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government in consultation with relevant departments, based on the national fiscal revenue and expenditure general estimates approved by the Central People's Government Committee, and implemented after being approved by the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government or submitted to the Central People's Government Committee for approval. The People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and the centrally-administered municipalities (cities) shall, based on the national fiscal revenue and expenditure general estimates approved by the Central People's Government Committee and the specific conditions in each region, prepare the annual fiscal revenue and expenditure budget and the monthly and quarterly fiscal revenue and expenditure plans for their respective Greater Administrative Areas (including the subordinate provinces and cities) and their respective People's Governments of the province (city), and submit them to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for verification and implementation. The People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and the centrally-administered municipalities (cities) shall, according to the unified regulations, report the monthly revenue and expenditure situation to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government at the end of each month, submit the quarterly revenue and expenditure calculations at the end of each quarter, and submit the annual final accounts for review at the end of the year. The aforementioned quarterly revenue and expenditure calculations shall be submitted within two months after the beginning of the next quarter; the annual final accounts shall be submitted before the end of March of the following year. The annual final accounts of the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and the centrally-administered municipalities (cities) shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, and together with the central-level annual final accounts, compiled into the national annual general final accounts and submitted to the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government for submission to the Central People's Government Committee for approval.

　　The People's Governments of the provinces (cities) under the Greater Administrative Areas shall, according to the annual fiscal revenue and expenditure estimates of their respective Greater Administrative Areas, prepare the annual fiscal revenue and expenditure budget and the monthly and quarterly revenue and expenditure plans for their respective People's Governments of the province (city), and report them to the Finance Department of the People's Government of the Greater Administrative Area for verification and implementation. They shall also report the revenue and expenditure situation to the Finance Department of the People's Government of the Greater Administrative Area on a monthly basis according to the prescribed items, and submit quarterly calculations and annual final accounts at the end of each quarter and year; another copy shall be submitted to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for record.

　　The People's Governments at all levels and their financial departments must be responsible for ensuring that revenue is not reduced and expenditure is not exceeded.

　　2. National agricultural tax in kind collected in various regions and the equivalent cash or other material objects, customs duties, salt taxes, commodity taxes, industrial and commercial taxes are all owned by the Central People's Government. Tax payments shall be remitted to the treasury of the Central People's Government. National agricultural tax in kind must be fully entered into the central agricultural tax in kind warehouse within half a month after collection. Other material objects shall be temporarily managed by the local authorities, subject to the allocation by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. In towns with established treasuries, tax payments must be deposited into the treasury on the same day; in towns and cities far from the treasury with less revenue, it must be deposited within three to five days. Delaying deposits or misappropriation is strictly prohibited. In areas with telegraph and telephone equipment, the collecting agencies and treasuries must report the revenue situation level by level by telegraph or telephone every day according to the system. Treasuries at all levels have the right to supervise and urge revenue collection from the collecting agencies. When collecting agencies remit payments to the treasury, treasuries at all levels must accept them immediately and must not delay or refuse to accept them under any pretext. If, during the peak tax season, there is more revenue and the counting cannot be completed in time, with the approval of the higher-level treasury, a number of temporary tally clerks may be hired to participate in the work. The financial departments of the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) must also conduct regular inspections and be responsible for supervising the implementation.

　　In addition to the above-mentioned taxes, other individual income tax, interest income tax, stamp tax, inheritance tax, transaction tax, slaughter tax, special consumption behavior tax, real estate tax, land tax, license plate tax, animal husbandry tax, dock usage fee, and other local surtaxes are all allocated for local retention by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government based on the annual financial budgets of the Greater Administrative Areas and the centrally-administered municipalities (cities); the portions to be retained by the People's Governments of the provinces (cities) under the Greater Administrative Areas shall be allocated by the Finance Department of the People's Government of the Greater Administrative Area based on the annual financial budgets of each province (city). The tax payments allocated for local retention must also be deposited into the People's Bank of China, and the bank shall act as the local treasury; it is strictly forbidden to deposit tax payments in private banks or financial institutions.

　　After the division of taxes, the central taxes shall be allocated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. The tax revenue retained for local use shall be allocated by the financial departments of the respective local governments according to the scope of the local government to which they are allocated.

　　The state agricultural tax in kind and tax revenue tasks assigned by the Central People's Government to the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) must be collected diligently by the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) in accordance with the policies, tax categories, tax rules, and tax rates prescribed by the Central People's Government; for those who exceed their assigned tasks, for agricultural tax in kind, 80% of the excess shall be retained locally and 20% shall be submitted to the central government; for tax revenue, 70% shall be retained locally and 30% shall be submitted to the central government, as a reward. The Greater Administrative Areas may also, based on the expenditure situation of the People's Governments of each province (city), consider allocating a portion of the retained local portion to the Greater Administrative Area and a portion to each province (city).

　　Various rural expenses, including rural primary schools, recreational activities, construction, county normal schools, education centers, hospital equipment, farms, nurseries, road construction, preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers, militia training, etc., can be resolved by the county people's government by collecting local surcharges on agricultural tax in kind. However, the local surcharge on agricultural tax in kind shall not exceed 15% of the national agricultural tax in kind, that is, if the state collects 100 shi of agricultural tax in kind, the local surcharge shall not exceed 15 shi. The expenses for urban municipal construction, primary school education, culture and hygiene, and suburban administrative education in each city can be resolved by collecting urban surcharges for political and educational undertakings. The collection methods, tax rules, and tax rates for this local surcharge on agricultural tax in kind and urban surcharge for political and educational undertakings must be submitted level by level for review and approved by the People's Government of the Greater Administrative Area before they can be collected, and must be reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for record. Centrally-administered municipalities (cities) must report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for approval before they can be collected.

　　The income and depreciation reserves of state-owned enterprises are all owned by the Central People's Government. The income of enterprises engaged in trade, banking, shipping, factories, mines, railways, and postal and telecommunications shall be submitted periodically by the competent authorities directly to the general treasury and reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government; other state-owned enterprises directly managed by the various ministries of the Central People's Government shall be collected by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government; those entrusted or allocated to the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) for management shall be collected by the Financial and Economic Committee and the Finance Department/Bureau of the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities).

　　For all the above-mentioned income, regardless of whether it is the task of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) to remit upwards or handled by the central government as an agent, the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) must conscientiously supervise the implementation and conduct regular inspections. If any organ or department is found to have appropriated, delayed, concealed, or embezzled funds, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government or the financial departments of local governments at all levels shall reduce, decrease, or suspend the allocation of their budgeted funds, withhold their funds and deposits, or impose disciplinary sanctions.

　　3. Military expenditures, including national defense construction, army, navy, and air force expenses, living expenses, food, clothing, equipment, ordnance, medicine, military supplies, transportation and combat, shall be budgeted monthly and quarterly by the military system, reviewed at each level, and approved by the General Logistics Department of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission within the scope of the military portion of the national fiscal revenue and expenditure estimates, and then transferred to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for verification and allocation according to the military expenditure portion of the national fiscal revenue and expenditure estimates.

　　In addition to the military expenditures directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in order to facilitate the supply of troops, all troops stationed in various regions may be authorized by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, according to the approved military budget, to the Financial and Economic Committees and the Finance Department/Bureau of the People's Governments of the Greater Administrative Areas and the centrally-administered municipalities (cities), according to the allocation order of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, to withdraw funds in installments from the district and branch treasuries and the district and provincial (municipal) central agricultural tax in kind warehouses, according to military needs, and pay them on their behalf; the specific measures shall be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government.

The expenses of the public security teams of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities), including the public security teams of counties and districts, the administrative expenses above the district level, the investments in state-owned enterprises and economic construction expenses of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities), including agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, river management, etc., the cultural and health undertakings and the educational expenses above the county-level middle schools, and the social undertakings of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities), including preferential treatment and relief, etc., shall all be included in the budget expenditures of the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) respectively.

　　The expenses for undertakings and the allocation of food and funds for the Greater Administrative Areas and directly-administered provinces (cities) shall be resolved from the financial tax revenue allocated to the local governments. If the tax revenue allocated to the local governments is not sufficient to cover the expenditures of the People's Governments at the corresponding levels, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government may allocate funds from the central tax revenue based on the financial revenue and expenditure budgets of the respective districts and provinces (cities).

　　Without the allocation order of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, the treasury of the Central People's Government and the material warehouses of the central agricultural tax in kind at all levels shall refuse to pay food and funds or other material objects. Those who use the central agricultural tax in kind materials or central tax revenue in violation of regulations shall be deemed to have used them illegally; the organs holding the allocation order may withdraw them from the designated treasury, grain warehouse, or material warehouse within the specified period. When disbursing food and funds, the Greater Administrative Areas and provinces (cities) must strictly abide by the principles of central government priority over local governments, military expenses priority over administrative expenses, and front-line priority over rear areas. In order to ensure that local expenses are not affected by rising prices, after receiving cash, local governments may deposit it in the local People's Bank of China for interest-free storage in kind and withdraw it on a ten-day basis.

　　4. To unify finance, it is necessary to strictly implement the budget and final accounts, audit and accounting systems, and strict financial supervision systems: verify the number of people, verify the expenditures, and turn over the surplus to the public; no appropriations without a budget, no audit of the budget without calculations, and correct the practice of replacing auditing with temporary approvals; and check at any time whether the revenue and expenditure departments are implementing the financial plan and whether there are any errors in the implementation. Establish strict withdrawal procedures and reporting systems, and report regularly. All receipts and vouchers without the signatures of the responsible persons and accountants of the organs shall be deemed invalid.

　　5. In order to unify the management of fiscal revenue and expenditure to overcome the national financial difficulties, the above items must be effectively implemented. After implementing the above measures, some difficulties may arise in various regions, which must be resolutely overcome. However, if there are certain difficulties that cannot be overcome locally, the Central People's Government shall be truthfully reported, stating the reasons, so that the Central People's Government can make necessary and possible remedies.

    四、统一财政必须严格执行预决算、审会计制度及严格的财政监察制度：核实人数，核实开支，节余缴公；无预算不拨款，无计算不审核预算，纠正以临时批拨代替审核的做法；并随时检查各收支部门，是否按照财政计划执行，及执行中有无错误。建立严格的支领手续及表报制度，定期结报，所有无机关负责人及会计签名之单据领条，应一律视为无效。
    五、为了统一管理财政收支以克服国家财政困难，以上各项必须切实地予以实施。在实施以上各项办法后，各地可能发生一些困难，必须坚决地予以克服。但有某些困难在地方上不能克服者，则应据实报告中央人民政府，说明理由，以便中央人民政府加以必要与可能的补救。
