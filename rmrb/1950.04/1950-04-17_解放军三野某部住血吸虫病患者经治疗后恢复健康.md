Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: After some soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army 3rd Field Army contracted Japanese schistosomiasis during water training in a certain area of East China at the end of last year, they were actively treated by a prevention and treatment team of more than 1,120 Shanghai medical personnel in cooperation with the unit's health workers. With the exception of a very small number of patients with contraindications who still need recuperation, all other patients have successively recovered their health.

After the prevention and treatment team arrived at the unit's station, treatment began on January 10th. During the eighty days of treatment ending at the end of March, it was divided into three stages: testing, injection, rest and re-examination. In the first stage, blood smears and stool incubation tests were carried out universally. Those with increased eosinophils in the blood or protein in the urine and enlargement of the liver were treated. The second stage of treatment mainly involved injecting trivalent antimony. The third stage was rest and re-examination, because the antimony toxin must be excreted completely two or three weeks after the injection is stopped, at which point the patient is considered to have fully recovered.

During these three months, the staff of the prevention and treatment team worked day and night to treat the patients, often working more than twelve hours a day. Amidst their busy work, they also used the gaps in their work to give hygiene lessons to the soldiers of the company, explaining various methods of preventing infectious diseases, and helping the troops improve environmental sanitation. Their positive and responsible work spirit was unanimously praised and loved by all the officers and soldiers of the unit. The patients all gave their beloved diaries, towels and other prizes to the medical staff. During the three months of work, more than 200 members of the prevention and treatment team were commended for their conscientious, responsible, and active work, and more than 80 people gloriously joined the New Democratic Youth League. In their work and study, they deeply realized the revolutionary qualities of the People's Liberation Army in serving the people wholeheartedly and their fine style of hard work and simplicity, and they improved politically.

　　解放军三野某部住血吸虫病患者经治疗后恢复健康
    【新华社上海十五日电】人民解放军第三野战军某部去年年底在华东某地进行水上练兵时，部分指战员感染了日本住血吸虫病，经上海医务人员组织的一千一百二十余人防治大队协同部队卫生工作人员进行近三个月的积极治疗后，除极少数有禁忌症者尚需疗养外，其余全部病员均已先后恢复健康。
    防治大队抵达该部驻地后，于一月十日开始治疗，到三月底止共八十天的治疗过程中，分检验、注射、休息和复查三个阶段。第一阶段内，普遍进行了血液涂片和大便孵化的检验工作，凡血液中嗜酸性白血球增加或小便带有蛋白质及肝脏有肿大现象的都作为治疗的对象。第二阶段治疗工作主要是注射三价锑。第三个阶段为休息和复查，因注射停止后，锑剂毒素必须两三个星期才能排泄完毕，此时患者才算完全恢复健康。
    三个月中防治大队工作人员夜以继日地为病患者进行治疗，每日工作时间经常在十二小时以上。他们在工作繁忙中还利用工作空隙为连队战士们上卫生课，讲解各种传染病的预防方法，帮助部队改善环境卫生。他们这种积极负责的工作精神，受到该部全体指战员一致的赞扬和爱戴。病员们都纷纷将自己心爱的日记本、毛巾等奖品赠送给医务人员。在三个月的工作中有二百多防治大队的工作人员由于认真、负责、积极地工作而立了功，并有八十几人光荣地参加了新民主主义青年团。他们在工作和学习中深深地体会到人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的革命品质和艰苦朴素的优良作风，在政治上得到了提高。
