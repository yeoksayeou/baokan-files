Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 25th: Shanghai schools have overcome economic difficulties and have successfully entered the spring semester of 1950. Before the start of the spring semester, due to the severe difficulties caused by the US-Chiang blockade, bombings, and rural disasters, there was a large gap between the schools' financial budgets and the students' ability to pay tuition. Therefore, some people in the education sector and parents of students were pessimistic about whether the schools could survive. However, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, teachers and students in various schools finally overcame numerous difficulties. The education administrative authorities, in coordination with the work of the Education Union, the Student Union, and the Youth League during the winter vacation, united teachers, students, and parents to negotiate and help each other, solving the financial difficulties of the schools. In the case of private schools, the main approach was to implement financial transparency, with school authorities, faculty, staff, and students engaging in democratic discussions to ensure that the interests of all three parties were taken into account and to implement austerity measures. For example, at the private Guanghua University, the school's original budget was very large, requiring students to pay an average tuition of over 180 real value units, and the deficit was still large. After joint consultation among students, professors, staff, and the president, the budget was recalculated carefully. Faculty and staff also held meetings and unanimously agreed to voluntarily reduce their salaries based on the principle of balancing income and expenditure in relation to living expenses, so that the budget could be balanced. Teachers and students at Shanghai University, during an investigation of the school's financial situation, discovered serious waste and fraud, which they corrected, resulting in a significant reduction in the new budget.

To jointly maintain the schools, most teachers and staff voluntarily reduced their salaries to alleviate the burden on the schools and students. For example, teachers at Guangzhong Middle School and Fenghua Middle School voluntarily halved their salaries, and teachers with better financial situations or lighter burdens even donated part of their salaries to help teachers and students with financial difficulties. Students also tried their best to pay tuition to maintain school expenses; some students who had originally applied for tuition reduction or exemption gave way to students with more difficult financial situations. For example, teachers and students at McTyeire School conducted home visits to students, and many students who had originally applied for reduction or exemption voluntarily withdrew their applications after seeing that others were more in need. The proportion of reduction and exemption at Dadde Midwifery School was reduced from 60% to 20% after democratic evaluation. On the other hand, at schools such as Huxin Middle School and Lizhi Middle School, the number of reduction and exemption places increased as a result of the school's austerity measures and the salary reductions of teachers and staff. For example, the number of reduction and exemption places at Lizhi Middle School increased from 15% to 25%.

In the case of public schools, students carefully conducted democratic evaluations and mutual assistance work regarding reduction and exemption, taking into account the state's financial difficulties. For example, some students at Jiaotong University and Fudan University voluntarily withdrew their applications for reduction and exemption to alleviate the burden on the People's Government. Some students who met the conditions for reduction and exemption preferred to borrow money from relatives and friends to pay tuition. Second-year students in the Chemical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University implemented large-scale mutual assistance, with the entire class giving up applying for reduction and exemption. In addition, schools in suburban areas launched wasteland reclamation to subsidize food expenses. Daxia University streamlined unnecessary courses and merged departments with small numbers of students and similar natures to reduce school expenses.

The tuition standards for private schools in Shanghai this semester are generally 10% to 20% lower than last semester.

　　紧缩开支·师生互助
    沪各校克服经济困难
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海各学校克服经济困难，已胜利进入一九五○年春季学习。各校在春季开学前，由于美蒋封锁、轰炸和农村灾荒所造成的严重困难，学校财政预算和学生缴费能力存在着很大的距离。因此若干教育界人士和学生家长曾对学校能否维持产生悲观情绪。但在共产党和人民政府正确领导下，各校师生终于战胜了重重困难。教育行政当局在寒假中配合教联、学联、青年团的工作，团结师生和学生家长，进行协商、互助，解决了学校财政的困难。私立学校方面，主要是实行经济公开，由校方、教职员、学生等民主讨论，以照顾三方面为原则，实行紧缩开支。如私立光华大学，校方原订的预算很大，学生每人平均须负担学费一百八十个折实单位以上，并且赤字仍很大，经学生、教授、职工和校长共同协商，精打细算，重订预算。教职员并分别召开了会议，一致同意根据生活费用以量入为出和量出为入相结合的原则，自愿减低待遇，使预算得以平衡。沪江大学师生在调查学校经济情况中，发现过去严重的浪费和舞弊现象，加以纠正，使新预算大为减少。
    各校教师员工为共同维持学校，大多自愿减低薪水，以减轻校方和学生的负担。如光中中学、奉化中学等校教员自愿将薪水减半，家境较好或负担较轻的教员还捐出部分薪水帮助经济困难的教员和学生。学生方面也尽力想办法缴费，以维持学校开支；有些原来申请减免学费的学生都让给经济情形更困难的学生去申请。如麦伦中学等校师生进行了学生家庭访问，许多原来申请减免费的学生在访问中看到别人比自己更困难，就自愿放弃了申请。大德助产学校的减免费额比例经民主评议后，自百分之六十减至百分之二十。另一方面，如沪新中学、励志中学等校，由于校方紧缩开支和教师员工减薪的结果，减免费名额因而增加。如励志中学的减免费名额由百分之十五增至百分之二十五。
    公立学校方面，学生们为照顾国家财政困难，慎重地进行了减免费的民主评议和互助工作。如交通大学、复旦大学等校部分学生均自动放弃减免费的申请，以减轻人民政府的负担。部分符合减免费条件的学生也宁愿向亲友借钱来缴费。交通大学化工系二年级学生实行大互助，全班放弃申请减免费。此外，郊区学校并发动开荒生产，以补贴伙食。大夏大学则精简不必要课程和合并人数少而性质相近的院系，减少学校开支。
    本学期上海各私立学校学费标准，一般较上学期减低了百分之十至二十。
