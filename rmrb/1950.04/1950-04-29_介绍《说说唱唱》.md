　　Introducing "Sayings and Singings"

　　"Sayings and Singings" is a popular literature and art monthly magazine, edited by the Beijing Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association, and published and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. It has now reached its fourth issue.

　　The works published in this magazine have a fresh style in both content and form. It uses various literary and artistic forms that are currently popular among the people and are well-received by them, such as storytelling, serial stories,快板 (clapper talk), lyrics, folk songs, folk rhymes, legends, stories, local Yangge dances, etc., to reflect the current lives of the people. Prose can "say," and rhymes can "sing," so that people who know a thousand or eight hundred characters can understand it; illiterate people who do not know the characters can understand it by listening to others tell and sing it. "Sayings and Singings" can be said to be a literary and artistic publication that gradually improves on the basis of today's existing popularization.

　　In Beijing, "Sayings and Singings" is printed 20,000 copies per issue, and it is also reprinted simultaneously in Northeast China and Shanghai. It has a large readership. A worker's newspaper in Qinhuangdao had an article introducing "Sayings and Singings" to the worker comrades, the gist of which is: "According to the feedback from many comrades, they feel that there are three unsolvable troubles when reading literary works. The first is that they want to read it, but they can't understand it after reading it for a long time; the second is that they finally understand it little by little, but the content written has little to do with us; third, those words are foreign and different from what we usually say. Now a popular literature and art publication has come out in Beijing. Worker comrades can take a look at it. It can be said that our three troubles have been solved all at once."

　　介绍《说说唱唱》
    《说说唱唱》是一种通俗文艺月刊，由北京市大众文艺创作研究会主编，新华书店出版发行。现在已经出到第四期了。
    这个刊物发表的作品，在内容和形式上，都有着一种新鲜的风格。它用今天流行在民间，被人民大众所喜闻乐见的各种文艺形式，像评话、套书、快板、唱词、民歌、民谣、传说、故事、地方秧歌等，来反映当前人民的生活。散文能“说”，韵文能“唱”，使认识个千八百个字的人，能够看得懂；不认识字的文盲，听别人说唱出来，能够听得懂。《说说唱唱》可以说是从今天已有的普及基础上，逐步提高的文艺刊物。
    《说说唱唱》在北京每期印发两万册，在东北和上海两地还同时翻版。它有着广大的读者。秦皇岛有一个工人小报有一篇文章介绍《说说唱唱》给工人同志们，其中的大意是：“据许多同志的反映，觉着看文艺作品，有三项解决不了的苦恼，第一是想看看，看了半天看不懂；第二是好容易一点一点看懂了，写的内容又和咱们关系不大；第三，那些话洋哩洋气的，和咱们平常说的不一样。现在咱北京出了一个大众化的文艺刊物，工友同志们可以看看，咱们的三项苦恼问题，可以说一古脑都给解决了。”
