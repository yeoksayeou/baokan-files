　　Today, China's textile industry has a fairly solid foundation and the conditions for development. Therefore, after the central government's unified financial revenue and expenditure and the initial stabilization of prices, a force for progress should be formed. However, in important cotton textile areas such as East China, temporary and localized difficulties have been encountered in various aspects such as raw material supply, capital turnover, and production and sales adjustments. The emergence of these difficulties has its objective factors. In the past ten years or so, general entrepreneurs, including those in the textile industry, have been accustomed to hoarding and speculating in order to make huge profits, and have not paid attention to the rational management of the enterprise itself. This is the gene that caused some of the difficulties in the textile industry itself, and it is by no means accidental. However, thanks to the people's government's resolute implementation of reasonable policies, the scope of these difficulties has been reduced, the degree has been lowered, the conditions for hoarding and speculation have disappeared, and the past economic trauma has been saved. If entrepreneurs recognize this point, and understand the great transformation of the state's financial work and the new measures for industrial and commercial operations, it will not be difficult to understand that a major transformation has also taken place in the essence of industry and commerce. These transformations have laid a solid foundation for the entire social economy, steadily restored people's lives to normal, and paved the way for entrepreneurs to develop production normally.

　　In this favorable new situation, China's textile industry has even more prerequisites for development: because it already has modern equipment and a relatively high level of technology. The raw material problem can be gradually resolved in the short term. With the gradual increase in the purchasing power of 475 million people, the demand for yarn and cloth will also greatly expand. Taking the Northeast as an example, the number of cloth sales in 1949 increased three times compared to 1948. After the completion of the land reform nationwide, the increase in the purchasing power of the vast majority of people is undoubtedly guaranteed. This bright and promising future will be realized step by step in the short term, and will likely become apparent in the second half of this year and next year. At that time, running all the cotton textile equipment in the country will not be enough.

　　In order to solve these temporary and localized difficulties and prepare for the development of the textile industry; first of all, entrepreneurs should study how to use their own strength in each enterprise itself. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the past erroneous style; to regain the confidence lost in one's own enterprise; and to bring back the funds that have already been evaded. Doing so not only conforms to the economic interests of the New Democracy, but also conforms to the interests of the entrepreneurs themselves.

　　Improving factory management, reducing redundant personnel, economizing on expenses, and reducing costs are practical issues that cotton textile entrepreneurs should put great effort into. Without all these efforts, it will be difficult to maintain and develop under long-term price stability. The era in which huge profits could be made without relying on good production has gone forever. For the sake of the entrepreneurs themselves, it is necessary to do so. Some entrepreneurs in Shanghai have already started doing this, which is very good. It should be persisted in and implemented.

　　In addition to the efforts of entrepreneurs, the common efforts of employees are also necessary. Otherwise, entrepreneurs will not be able to run the factory well. The employees of the cotton textile industry must unite closely and proactively strive to jointly shoulder the responsibility of doing a good job in production with entrepreneurs. On the entrepreneur's side, it should also be recognized that it is impossible and should not be adopted undemocratic methods to treat employees today, but must adopt a consultative attitude with employees. Before the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in Tianjin's private Hengyuan and Beiyang yarn factories, the average daily output per spindle was less than 0.6 pounds. After the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings, the output gradually increased, and the average daily output per spindle increased to 0.8 pounds, which is a good example. Entrepreneurs must break the concept of disdain or fear of consulting with employees. The working class is the leading class, a class with foresight, and is most able to recognize the overall situation and take care of the overall situation. As long as everything is sincere, there are no difficulties that cannot be solved. Entrepreneurs should boldly reform the management system and improve the enthusiasm of employees, so that labor and management can jointly overcome the current temporary difficulties.

　　The people's government has made and is making great efforts to overcome the temporary difficulties in the cotton textile industry. The state finances in 1950 were difficult, but the government is making great efforts to purchase cotton, reward increased cotton production, and has paid a large portion of foreign exchange to import foreign cotton to maintain cotton raw materials. This is not only for the supply of state-owned textile factories, but also for the supply of private textile factories. Regarding the regulations on the number of operating days of textile factories, we must not only take care of state-owned factories, but also take care of private factories, so that both state-owned and private factories can continue to produce. Another example is the joint cotton purchasing institutions of state-owned and private textile factories. The funds contributed by state-owned factories exceed the proportion of spindles they occupy, and state-owned enterprises provide great assistance to the joint purchasing offices in terms of price. For textile factories with difficulties in capital turnover, the government has adopted methods such as processing and weaving on behalf of others and signing supply and sales contracts to solve part of the difficulties in capital turnover of private textile factories and relieve the concerns of private factories about the source of raw materials and the sales of finished products. For some individual factories with particularly difficult capital, the People's Bank and state-owned trading companies have also adopted loan and purchase policies. In the recent sluggish sales of yarn and cloth, in order to avoid excessive decline in yarn prices and affect production, state-owned trading institutions have used various methods to maintain yarn prices. They would rather endure difficulties and never compete with private factories for sales; and carry out a large amount of processing to maintain private factories. The government has done and is doing a lot of work to help the private textile industry, and the people's government will continue to implement these correct policies.

　　However, if it is believed that the government should independently bear the entire difficulties of solving the cotton textile industry, it is actually impossible to do so. If the government puts all the difficulties of the cotton textile industry on its own shoulders, such as unlimited loans to every textile factory, the result will affect the entire financial price, and even the cotton textile industry itself will not get effective results. This is very obvious.

　　In short, the temporary and localized difficulties currently encountered by the cotton textile industry under the improvement of the overall financial situation clearly raise such a question to entrepreneurs: how to use their own greatest efforts, unite the masses of employees, and effectively overcome them under the policy of taking into account both public and private interests. In the future, the government may need to pay more attention to and try to implement various facilities that take into account both public and private interests, and entrepreneurs must also take into account the actual difficulties of the public and make more efforts for their own business from the private side.

　　The prospect is definitely bright, and temporary difficulties can be overcome with everyone's joint efforts.

### 转变中的棉纺织工业

　　转变中的棉纺织工业
    今天，中国纺织业的基础是相当稳固，而且具备了发展条件的。因此，在中央政府统一财经收支和初步稳定物价之后，应当形成一种向前进展的力量。但，目前在棉纺织业重要地区如华东，却在各种各样的问题上，如原料供应，资金周转和产销调节等等，反遭遇到暂时性和局部性的困难。这些困难的产生是有其客观因素存在的。过去十几年中，一般企业家，包括纺织企业中人在内，都习惯于囤积投机，图发暴利，对于企业本身的合理经营工作，反而不加注意。这是造成纺织业本身一些困难的基因，决非偶然发生的。可是，由于人民政府坚决执行了合理的政策，把这些困难的范围缩小了，程度减低了，囤积投机的条件消逝了，把过去的经济创伤挽救过来了。如果企业家认识到这一点，并且了解到这次国家财经工作的大转变，以及对于工商业经营等各方面的新措施，也就不难明白工商业在本质上同样的已起了一个大转变。这些转变，为整个社会经济打下了坚强的基础，使人民生活稳步地恢复了常态，为企业家铺平了正常发展生产的道路。
    在这个有利的新形势下，中国纺织业更有了发展的前提：因为它已经有了近代化的设备和相当高的技术水平。原料问题可以在短期内逐步求得基本解决。益以四万万七千五百万人的购买力的逐渐提高，纱布的需要，也将大大地扩张起来。以东北为例，一九四九年销售布匹数量比一九四八年增加了三倍。全国土改完成后，绝大多数人民购买力的提高是毫无问题的。这个光明远大的前途，在短期内便将次第实现，而在今年下半年和明年或将显出端倪来。那时候把全国棉纺织的全部设备运转起来，也将不敷应用了。
    为了解决这些暂时性和局部性的困难以及发展纺织工业的准备；首先，企业家应该研究一下：怎样把本身的力量使用在各个企业本身上面。因此，就要把过去的错误作风改正过来；把对本身企业失去的信心挽回过来；把已经逃避的资金再拿回来。这样做，不仅符合了新民主主义的经济利益，也正符合了各企业家自己的利益。
    关于改进工厂管理减少冗员，撙节开支，减低成本等等是棉纺织企业家应该用极大力量来进行的实际问题。没有这一切努力，就难以在物价长期稳定的状态之下维持和发展的。过去那种可以不赖搞好生产，而牟取暴利的时期，从此一去不复返了。为了企业家本身的利益，必需如此做的。现在上海已经有部分企业家，开始在这样做了，这是很好的。应当坚持和贯彻下去。
    除了企业家的努力以外，还必需职工们共同努力。否则，企业家也将无法办好工厂。棉纺织业的职工们必需紧密地团结起来，主动地争取与企业家共同担负起搞好生产的责任。在企业家方面也应当认清今天决不可能也不应该采取不民主的方式来对待职工，而是必须与职工采取协商的态度，天津私营恒源，北洋等纱厂，在未成立劳资协商会议之前，每锭每日平均产量不到○·六磅，建立劳资协商会议之后，产量逐步上升，平均每锭每日产量增加到○·八磅，这是很好的例子。企业家一定要打破不屑或害怕与职工商量的观念。工人阶级是领导阶级，是具有远见的阶级，最能认清大局，照顾全面，只要一切真诚相见，没有不能解决的困难，企业家要放手进行管理制度的改革，提高职工的积极性。以便劳资双方共同克服目前的暂时困难。
    人民政府在克服棉纺织工业的暂时性的困难中间是尽了和正在尽着很大的努力。一九五○年国家财政是困难的，但政府正以大力收购棉花，奖励增产棉花，并支付了很大一部分外汇来进口外棉，维持棉纺原料。这不仅为了供给公营纺织工厂，而且为了供给私营纺织工厂。关于纺织厂开工日数的规定，我们不仅要照顾公营工厂，而且要照顾私营工厂，使公营工厂与私营工厂均能继续生产。再如公私营纺织厂的棉花联购机构，公营工厂所出资金，超过其锭子所占比例，国家企业对于联购处更在价格上予以极大帮助。对于资金周转困难的纺织厂，政府曾采取了代纺代织，订立供销合约等办法，替私营纺织厂解决了一部分资金周转的困难，解除了私营工厂原料来源与成品销售的顾虑。对于某些资金特别困难的个别工厂，人民银行及国营贸易公司也采取了贷款和收购的政策。在最近纱布滞销声中，为了避免纱价过份低落，影响生产，国营贸易机构曾用各种方法维持纱价。宁愿忍受困难，决不与私营工厂争夺销路；且进行大量的加工来维持私营工厂。政府为了帮助私营纺织业已做和正在做着许多工作，对于这些正确的政策，人民政府将要继续执行。
    但如果认为政府应该独力担当解决棉纺织业的全部困难则是事实上所办不到的。政府如果拿棉纺织业的困难，全部担在自己肩上，例如无限制的对每家纺织厂贷款，则其结果将影响整个金融物价，即使棉纺织业本身也得不到有效的结果，这个道理是很明显的。
    总之，目前棉纺织业在整个财经情况好转下所遇到的暂时性和局部性的困难，明白的给企业家们提出了这样一个问题：如何用自身最大的努力，团结职工群众，在公私兼顾的政策下，来加以有效的克服。政府方面今后可能要更多的注意和设法贯彻公私兼顾种种设施，企业家方面也必需照顾公家的实际困难，更多的从私人方面进行一切为本身事业的努力。
    远景的光明是肯定的，暂时的困难在大家共同努力下是可以克服的。
