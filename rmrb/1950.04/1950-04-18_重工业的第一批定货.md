　　The First Batch of Orders for Heavy Industry
    Liu Ding
    Editor's Note: The National Steel and Electrical Machinery Ordering Conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on February 5th of this year and lasted for nineteen days, closing on the 27th. Contracts were signed successively after the meeting and have now concluded. The first stage of the meeting involved exchanging information on supply and demand. In the second stage, ministries such as Railways, Fuel, and Agriculture began discussions and signed annual ordering contracts. Subsequently, negotiations were conducted separately with other departments regarding ordering matters. Based on the urgency and reasonable use of production capacity, the year's production was arranged, and specific delivery times were determined. The meeting was very successful. This article written for our newspaper by Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of Heavy Industry, aims to introduce the main issues and achievements of this conference.

    The first batch of heavy industrial product orders for 1950 has been signed, with a total value of 1.7 trillion RMB, equivalent to approximately 720,000 metric tons of millet.

    The value of this batch of orders is three and a half times the value of machinery and tools imported in 1946, ten times the value of tea exported in the same year, or equal to the annual living expenses of 3.2 million farmers. This is only a portion of the national steel, electrical machinery, and chemical products. The second and third batches of heavy industrial product orders for 1950 are underway, and if they receive the support of relevant departments nationwide, they may be no less valuable than the first batch.

    Such a large-scale centralized ordering process is unprecedented in our country. After overthrowing imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Chinese people are embarking on reorganizing our national economy. The supply and sales imbalances and the disconnection between production and distribution caused by the old chaotic and anarchic production order are still serious. For example, on one hand, machines are piled up in warehouses, while on the other hand, machines are manufactured regardless of everything; on one hand, machine factories are unemployed, while on the other hand, there is a demand for a large number of machine imports. Generally, manufacturing plants do not know what to make, or they randomly copy designs, produce finished products and do not know who to give them to, or put them on the market to wait for buyers, or store them in warehouses. This phenomenon illustrates the extreme difficulty in transforming the old economic system.

    Our task is to organize the production and sales of existing industries according to the greatest interests of the people, and to fix it with an order system, guarantee it with contracts, strive to overcome the blindness of production, and gradually strengthen its planned nature. To make our production suitable for certain social needs, and to coordinate the supply and sales of various industries.

    The first batch of industrial orders already signed at the Ministry of Heavy Industry's ordering conference will bring tangible benefits to various industrial sectors, including private enterprises:

    (1) Breaking the disconnection between production and sales, saving many factories from prolonged stagnation.

    (2) Mutual ordering, continuous ordering, transfers, and allocations, saving a large amount of currency.

    (3) Professional division of labor among factories, improving quality and reducing costs.

    (4) Avoiding factories stockpiling finished products and tying up capital.

    (5) Avoiding waste on agents, advertising, and other expenses.

    (6) Encouraging users to use domestic products more, saving foreign exchange, and promoting self-reliance.

    (7) Guaranteeing reproduction costs, stabilizing prices, and avoiding fluctuations.

    Such gains will be further reflected in various economic sectors and will gradually and widely promote the planned nature of the economy.

    The Ministry of Heavy Industry's ordering conference reflected the needs of all parties, investigated the production capacity of various factories, and calculated costs, achieving some success. However, in the course of two months, it also exposed and corrected some erroneous ideas.

    First, there was insufficient confidence in self-reliance. For example, some people fundamentally opposed ordering domestic products. However, judging from the machinery displayed by the Ministry of Heavy Industry this time, our domestically manufactured machine tools or other machines have made considerable progress. We cannot judge today's situation based on past perspectives, and our future efforts are limitless.

    Second, the benefits of the ordering system were underestimated, and production and sales orders were regarded as simple commercial transactions, resulting in impatience and a desire for quick results. The difficulties in ordering were ignored, and quick success was demanded. We require orderers to have a sense of responsibility for the certainty of contract conditions such as quantity, quality, time, and payment. Once a contract is signed, it is legally binding. Therefore, any order is not completed in one discussion, and it may be delayed due to practical difficulties. If this objective delay is regarded as the other party's subjective mischief or unwillingness, and thus the negotiation is considered a failure, then that is completely wrong. Both parties must be prepared to overcome all difficulties.

    Third, conscious and unconscious small merchant thinking. This hinders ordering, and we should always be vigilant.

    Fourth, some people believe that ordering does not require national leadership, and that each industry, department, and even private capital should place orders on their own. This is also wrong. For various reasons, it is difficult for them to carry out large-scale ordering among themselves. When they order on their own, they often do not take into account the state's major economic policies, or even contradict them greatly. Comprehensive ordering must be led by central authorities to achieve a more satisfactory result.

    We want to appeal to economic workers across the country, we must encourage producers to work hard to produce, strive for low prices and high quality, and do their best to supply various needs; at the same time, encourage users to use domestic products as much as possible, consciously supporting their own industry; workers in central supply and sales agencies should find ways to meet the actual ordering requirements of various departments and implement the state's economic policy of taking into account both public and private interests. Implementing mutual assistance and continuous ordering in this way, relying primarily on self-reliance, coupled with the use of foreign aid, is beneficial to the recovery and development of the national economy.

    To this end, we hope that ordering is not only for this year, but also for next year and even the year after, and all production should be planned in the first year in order to be complete and appropriate.

    We hope that the ordering system will be implemented not only between central ministries, between central and local governments, between industry and agriculture, but also between public and private enterprises, under the leadership of the state's overall economic plan, setting off a nationwide ordering system movement in all sectors of the national economy.

    We look forward to the first batch of orders leading to the second batch, the third batch, and countless batches of orders. Establishing the important position of the ordering system in our guiding ideology, let us gradually organize the entire national economy through the ordering system.

### 重工业的第一批定货

　　重工业的第一批定货
    刘鼎
    编者按：中央人民政府重工业部全国钢铁电机定货会议，于本年二月五日在京开幕，会议历时十九日，于二十七日闭幕。会后相继签定合同，现已结束。会议第一阶段系交换供需情况，第二阶段由铁道、燃料、农业等部开始商谈，签定全年订货合同。继与其他各部门分头洽商订货事项，依据轻重缓急与生产能力之合理使用，布置全年生产，定出具体的交货时间。会议开得很好。重工业部副部长刘鼎为本报写的这篇文章，目的就在于介绍此次会议的主要问题和收获。
    一九五○年重工业产品的第一批定货已经签定，总值人民币一七、○○○亿元，约合伏地小米七二○、○○○公吨。
    这一批定货的价值，等于一九四六年进口机器和工具价值的三倍半，等于同年出口茶叶价值的十倍，或等于三百二十万农民一年的生活费用。这仅是全国钢铁、电机和化工品的一部分。一九五○年重工业产品的第二批定货和第三批定货正在进行中，如果得到全国各有关部门的支持，它们可能不比第一批定货的价值为小。
    这样大规模的集中的定货，在我国是空前的。我国人民在推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动统治之后，正在着手改组我们的国民经济，旧日混乱无政府的生产秩序所造成的供销失调，生产与分配脱节等现象，仍然严重。例如，一边是机器堆满仓库，一边却不顾一切地制造机器；一边是机器厂失业，一边却要求大量机器入口。一般制造厂不知道做什么，或者是随便找样子做，做出成品不知给谁，或者放到市场上等买主，或者入库存储。这种现象说明了要改造旧的经济体系是存在着极大的困难。
    我们的任务就是要把现有工业的生产和销路，按照人民的最大利益组织起来，而且用定货制把它固定起来，用合同保证起来，努力克服生产的盲目性，逐渐加强其计划性。使我们的生产适合社会一定的需要，使各业各行的供销互相配合起来。
    重工业部定货会议已经签定的第一批工业定货，将使各工业部门，包括私营企业在内，获得现实的利益：
    （１）打破了产销之间的脱节，挽救了许多工厂长期的萧条。
    （２）互相定货，连续定货，转账，拨账，节省了大量通货。
    （３）各工厂专业分工，提高质量，降低成本。
    （４）避免了工厂堆积成品，积压资金。
    （５）避免了经纪人，广告等浪费。
    （６）鼓励使用者多用国货，节省外汇，有利于自力更生。
    （７）保证再生产成本，稳定物价，避免波动。
    这样的收获将进一步反映到各经济部门，将会逐渐广泛地促进经济的计划性。
    重工业部的定货会议反映了各方面的需要，调查了各工厂的生产能力，计算了成本，得到一点成绩。但是在两个月的过程中，也暴露和纠正了一些错误的思想。
    第一、对自力更生的信念不够。如有人根本不主张定用国货。但根据重工业部这次陈列机器看来，我国自造机床或其他机器已颇有进步，不能以过去眼光来判定今日的情况，而且我们未来的努力是不可限量的。
    第二、轻视定货制的好处，而把产销定货当成简单的商场买卖，从而发生不耐心的急躁情绪。忽视定货中的困难，要求速成。我们要求定货者对数量，质量，时间，付价等合同条件的确实性要有责任心。合同一旦签定，就受法律约束。因此，任何定货不是一谈便成的，很可能因为实际困难而拖延时日。如果把这种客观的拖延，当成对方主观的捣鬼或不愿意，因而认为谈判失败，那就完全错了。双方必须有准备地克服一切困难。
    第三、自觉和不自觉的小商人思想。这是妨害定货的，我们应该时刻加以警惕。
    第四、有人以为定货用不着国家来领导，让各行各业各部甚至各私人资本各自定货，这也是错误的。因为种种原因，他们各自之间的定货难于大量进行。他们自己定货，往往对国家经济的大政方针，无所照顾，甚或大相抵触。全面的订货必须经过中央机关的领导，才能达到较圆满的结果。
    我们要向全国经济工作同志们呼吁，我们要鼓励生产者努力生产，力求价廉物美，尽力供应各种需要；同时鼓励需用者尽量采用国货，有意识地扶植自己的工业；中央供销机关的工作者，应该设法满足各部门的实际定货要求，实现国家公私兼顾的经济的方针。如此实行互助连续定货，首先靠自力更生，再加上利用外援，对于国民经济的恢复与发展是有利的。
    为此，我们希望，定货不但是为了今年，而且还要为明年甚至于后年而定货，一切生产要在头一年计划好，才能完备妥当。
    我们希望，定货制不但在中央各部之间，中央与地方之间，工业与农业之间，而且在公私企业之间，在国家整个经济计划领导之下，都实行起来，在国民经济的各部门掀起全面定货制运动。
    我们期待第一批定货，引导出第二批第三批，以至无数批的定货。在我们领导思想中确立定货制的重要地位，让我们把全部国民经济通过定货制而逐步组织起来。
