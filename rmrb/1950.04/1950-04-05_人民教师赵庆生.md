　　People's Teacher Zhao Qingsheng

　　Zhao Qingsheng is a poor peasant from Kongjiawu in the Fourth District of Wen'an. He attended primary school for five years. In 1945, after Wen'an City was liberated, he became the education commissioner of his village. In 1947, he joined the Communist Party. He was captured by the Kuomintang army and severely tortured, but he firmly refused to yield. He escaped when the enemy was forced to retreat by our army. After the autumn land reform, Zhao Qingsheng was allocated land and housing. The following year, he became a primary school teacher in his village. He taught students while studying himself, and spent one shi (300 jin) of corn to buy a foreign-bound "Jia Zhong Ci Yuan" (a type of dictionary). In this way, he overcame the difficulty of having a low level of education.

　　Last year, floods caused great difficulties for running the primary school, and students also had problems buying books. In November, he saw an article in the Hebei Daily introducing the method of leaching saltpeter, and planned to solve the problem of students buying books through student production. However, when he discussed it with the parents, they all disagreed. Zhao Qingsheng studied the reasons why the masses disagreed, fearing that he would be like the former teacher Liu Xianting, who made the students produce for a long time, only for the teacher to benefit; and also fearing that it would delay classes. Therefore, he proposed three guarantees to the parents: first, no embezzlement; second, production and learning would not be delayed; and third, he would not be afraid of hard work. In this way, the parents approved it. He then sought out Meng Dezhong, a model producer of boiling saltpeter, for painstaking research and experimentation, and mobilized 30 students to sweep saltpeter soil in their spare time. When they started boiling saltpeter, he called on the students to broadcast the results and methods of leaching saltpeter from the high house every day and promote it at home to mobilize the masses to leach saltpeter. Twenty days later, the students boiled a total of 581 jin of crude saltpeter, obtaining 181 jin of corn. In this way, more than 60 households in the village also started saltpeter production. At this time, the students ended their collective production and went home to help their families sweep soil and boil saltpeter after school every day. Zhao Qingsheng and Meng Dezhong also went deep into the households to guide them and help them improve their output. Now, almost every one of the 163 households in the village is boiling saltpeter, which has basically solved the problem of livelihood for the winter and spring.

　　Under the slogan of "No delay in production and learning" and "Buying books without spending money" (it is stipulated that students can borrow production funds to buy books and stationery), the number of students increased from 30 to 61 (out of 82 school-age children in the village). In order to correctly stipulate class time, Zhao Qingsheng convened a general meeting of students, stipulating that general students should review in the morning and attend classes after meals; students who need to pick up firewood should make up classes in the evening or be taught at any time. In this way, students can ensure that they are always full and persevere in education in the disaster area.

　　When the government called for the transformation of gunpowder saltpeter to crude saltpeter, he helped two gunpowder saltpeter groups to transform into crude saltpeter groups. During the Spring Festival, when the government called for "uninterrupted production," on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, in addition to leading students to broadcast propaganda to the masses, he also organized more than 30 students to personally lead them to pick up firewood in the fields; on the first day of the first lunar month, he led the students to sweep soil, which drove 110 men and women in the village to also pick up firewood and sweep soil, creating a mass production upsurge. When the government called for "production and thrift," because the school's funds were insufficient, he went to push a wheelbarrow during the holidays and earned ten jin of millet to supplement the office expenses. When running the winter school, he responded to the government's call and served as a political teacher in the winter school, and he was very serious in class. Recently, after receiving the government's call to "transform winter schools into people's schools," he is planning to help with the work of transforming into people's schools.

　　However, it must be pointed out that Zhao Qingsheng's view of his above achievements is biased. He did not realize that his achievements were not the result of his own efforts, but the achievements of the Party, the government, and the masses. Therefore, in his actions, he showed more or less arrogance. It is hoped that he will overcome this wrong thinking in the future and serve the people better.

　　人民教师赵庆生
    赵庆生是文安四区孔家坞的一个贫农，上过五年小学。一九四五年，文安城解放后，他当了本村教育委员，一九四七年参加了共产党。他曾被国民党军捕去，严刑拷打，但他坚决不屈，趁敌人被我军迫退时跑了出来。秋后土改了，赵庆生分得了地和房。第二年，他当了本村的小学教员，他一面学习、一面就教学生；并花了一石（三百斤）玉米，买了一部洋装的甲种辞源。这样，便克服了文化低的困难。
    去年雨涝成灾，造成了坚持小学的极大困难，学生买书也都成了问题。十一月，他看到河北日报上介绍了淋硝办法，便打算通过学生生产，解决学生买书问题。可是他和家长们一商量，家长们都不同意。赵庆生研究了群众不同意的原因，是怕他和前任教员刘献亭一样，学生生产了半天，都给先生赶了忙；又怕耽误了课。于是他向家长们提出三个保证条件：一是不贪污，二是生产学习两不耽误，三是不怕受累。这样，家长们就通过了。他便找熬火硝的生产模范孟德中苦心研究、试验，还发动了三十个学生在课余时间去扫硝土。开始熬硝时，每天把淋硝的成绩和方法，叫学生在高房广播，回家宣传，号召群众淋硝。二十天后，学生共熬出皮硝五百八十一斤，得玉米一百八十一斤。这样，村里也有六十多户人家，开始了淋硝生产。这时，学生们便结束了集体生产，每天放学回家帮助家庭扫土熬硝。赵庆生和孟德中也深入到各户指导，帮助提高产量。到现在全村一百六十三户差不多家家都在熬硝，基本上解决了去冬今春的生活问题。
    在“生产学习两不误”、“买书不花钱”的口号下（规定买书买文具可借用学生生产款），学生由三十人增到了六十一名（全村学龄儿童八十二人）。赵庆生为了正确的规定上课时间，召开了学生全体大会，规定了一般学生早晨复习，饭后上课；要拾柴的学生则晚上补课或随时教导。这样，学生们都能保证经常满员，坚持了灾区教育。
    在政府号召火硝转皮硝的时候，他帮助了两个火硝组转为皮硝组。年节，政府号召“生产不停”，他在腊月三十的那一天，除带领学生向群众广播宣传外，又组织起学生三十多人，亲自率领到地里去拾柴；正月初一，他又带领学生去扫土，带动了村里一百一十名男女群众也去拾柴扫土，造成了群众性的生产热潮。在政府号召“生产节约”时，因校中经费不足，他便在假期中去推脚，挣了小米十斤，补充在办公费上。在开办冬校时，他响应政府的号召，在冬校中兼任政治课教员，上课时很是认真。最近接到了政府关于“冬校转民校”的号召后，他又计划帮助转成民校的这一工作。
    但是，必须指出赵庆生同志对自己以上成绩的看法，是有偏差的。他没有认识到他的成绩不是自己一个人的功劳，而是党、政府、群众的功劳，因此，在行动上便表现了或多或少的自高自大。希望他今后克服这种错误思想，更好为人民服务。
