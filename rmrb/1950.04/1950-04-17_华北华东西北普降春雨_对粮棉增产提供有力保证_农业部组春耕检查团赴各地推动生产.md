Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a report from the Central Meteorological Observatory: Bountiful rain has fallen continuously in North China, East China, and Northwest China in recent days. In North China (including Taiyuan, Tianjin, Tanggu, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou and other places), rain has fallen generally from the evening of the 14th to today. The amount of rainfall is very abundant in all places except Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou, where it is relatively small. The total rainfall in Beijing from 19:25 on the 14th to 15:14 on the 16th reached 110.2 mm, exceeding the city's previous record of the highest monthly rainfall in April for decades. In East China, the four provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang began to receive spring rain as early as the evening of the 13th, and the rainfall was also abundant.

Since this spring, there has been sufficient rainfall in the Guanzhong Plain area of Shaanxi, the main producing area of wheat and cotton in Northwest China, and it has been blessed with soaking rain since the 15th, and a bumper harvest of summer crops is expected. According to a report from the Meteorological Observatory of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry: The spring rain in the Guanzhong Plain this year has exceeded the average rainfall of the past 18 years. In the first half of April alone, the region reached 69.9 mm (the historical average is 36.6 mm, and the historical maximum is 69.2 mm), which can wet the soil by more than 13 inches, which is more abundant than the spring rain in 1938, a year of good harvest.

According to people in the capital's agricultural science community, the current spring plowing season is just right, and this spring rain is very timely, which will greatly benefit the growth of winter wheat and the sowing of cotton and other crops, and provide a good condition for the realization of this year's grain and cotton increase plan.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: In order to implement this year's grain and cotton increase plan, and to inspect and promote the spring plowing production movement, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has specially transferred more than 80 cadres from the ministry to form spring plowing inspection teams, which will be dispatched to East China, Central South, Southwest, Northwest, Northeast, and North China in the coming days. The spring plowing inspection teams are expected to work outside for two months. In addition to inspecting the transmission, deployment, and implementation of this year's grain and cotton increase plan, they will also focus on the natural conditions, production characteristics, specific difficulties, and troop production related to agricultural production. Investigation and research on other issues will be conducted.

　　华北华东西北普降春雨
    对粮棉增产提供有力保证   
    农业部组春耕检查团赴各地推动生产
    【新华社十六日讯】据中央气象台报告：华北、华东、西北等地连日普降甘霖。华北（包括太原、天津、塘沽、石家庄、张家口等地）各地自十四日晚间至今日为止普遍降雨，所降雨量除太原、张家口两地较小外，其他各地都极充沛。北京市自十四日十九时二十五分开始至十六日十五时十四分止总降雨量达一一零点二公厘，超过该市以往数十年来的四月份全月最高雨量的纪录。华东地区山东、江苏、安徽、浙江四省则早在十三日晚起即已开始普降春雨，雨量亦多。
    西北小麦及棉花的主要产区陕西关中平原一带今春以来雨量充足，自十五日起又获透雨，夏田丰收有望。据西北军政委员会农林部气象台报告：关中平原今年春雨已经超过十八年来的平均雨量。该区今年四月份仅上半月已达六十九点九公厘（历年平均为三十六点六公厘，历年最高量为六十九点二公厘）可浸湿土壤十三寸以上，较丰收的一九三八年的春雨更为充足。
    据首都农业科学界人士谈，目前正届春耕季节，这场春雨极合时宜，将大大有利于冬麦的生长和棉花等作物的播种，对今年的粮棉增产计划的实现提供了一个良好的条件。
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府农业部为着贯彻今年粮棉增产计划，检查和推动春耕生产运动，特抽调该部干部八十余人组成春耕检查团，将于日内陆续分赴华东、中南、西南、西北、东北、华北各地工作。各春耕检查团预计在外工作两个月，除检查今年粮棉增产计划的传达、布置和实施的情形外，并将有重点地对有关农业生产的自然情况、生产上的特点和具体困难、部队生产等问题进行调查研究。
