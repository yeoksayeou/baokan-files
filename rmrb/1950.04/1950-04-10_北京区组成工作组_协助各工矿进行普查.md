　　Beijing District Forms Work Group
    Assisting Factories and Mines in Conducting Census
    [Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: In order to implement the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on the national industrial and mining enterprise census, the Beijing District Industrial and Mining Enterprise Census Work Group has been formally established and will immediately begin assisting various factories and mines in conducting the census. More than ten units, including the Central Financial and Economic Committee, central industrial departments, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, are participating in the Beijing District census work, with the Beijing Municipal People's Government as the main body. The census scope includes all state-owned, joint state-private industrial and mining enterprises, and industrial production cooperatives, totaling approximately one hundred units. The work in the Beijing District has also been designated by the Central Financial and Economic Committee as a demonstration area. It is expected that the filling out of forms will be completed before May 13th, after which the census experience will be promoted nationwide. Staff members of the various units participating in the Beijing District Census Work Group have already conducted preliminary preparatory work. The group convened a census work conference on the 8th, gathering more than 400 factory directors and union leaders from various industrial and mining enterprises in the Beijing District, calling on all units to attach importance to and do a good job in this work. Di Chaobai, Director of the Statistics Department of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, spoke at the meeting. He explained that the Central Financial and Economic Committee decided to use the census method to thoroughly understand the basic situation of industrial and mining enterprises nationwide, which is of great significance. State-owned enterprises must restore and develop production in accordance with plans and decide on the factory's business in accordance with plans. However, making plans requires a precise understanding of the basic conditions of each unit's production. Therefore, the census work is the first step in determining the plan. In the past, the materials submitted by various units to higher authorities differed in terms of the timing of submission, the inconsistency of items, the inconsistency of calculation methods and classification forms, and the materials of individual units were not completely accurate and truthful. Therefore, the Central Financial and Economic Committee could not draft next year's production plan and longer-term construction plans based on these materials. Through this census work, a scientific statistical reporting system and the foundation for implementing a planned economy can be initially laid. He called on all units to carefully count, check, and fill out the forms. Each factory and mine should organize responsible cadres from statistics, accounting, and engineering departments to humbly study and research, formulate a work implementation schedule, and do everything possible to do a good job in the census work.

　　北京区组成工作组
    协助各工矿进行普查
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：为执行中央人民政府财政经济委员会关于全国工矿企业普查的决定，北京区工矿企业普查工作组已正式组成，即开始协助各工矿进行普查工作。参加北京区普查工作的有中央财委会、中央各工业部门和全国总工会等十余单位，以北京市人民政府为主。普查范围包括所有公营、公私合营的工矿企业和工业生产合作社等约一百个单位。北京区的工作并经中央财委会规定为示范区，预计五月十三日以前完成填报工作，然后把普查经验推广全国。参加北京区普查工作组各单位工作人员已经进行了初步准备工作。该组于八日召集北京区各工矿企业的厂长及工会负责人共四百余人举行普查工作大会，号召各单位重视并做好这一工作。会上中央财委会统计处处长狄超白讲话，他说明中央财委会决定用普查方法彻底了解全国各工矿企业的基本情况，意义是很重大的。国家企业必须依据计划来恢复和发展生产，依计划来决定工厂的业务，但是做计划须先精确了解各单位生产条件的基本情况，所以普查工作是决定计划的第一步。过去各单位向上级所呈报的材料，由于呈报时间先后不同、项目不一致、计算方法和分类表式也不一样，个别单位的材料且不完全正确真实，所以中央财委会不能根据这些材料草拟明年生产计划以及更长期的建设计划。经过这次普查工作，可以初步奠立科学的统计报告制度及实施计划经济的基础。他号召各单位认真统计、核对填报，各厂矿要组织统计、会计、工务等负责干部，虚心学习研究，拟定工作的实施进程，尽一切可能把普查工作做好。
