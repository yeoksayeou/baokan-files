Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 6th: In order to implement the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on unifying national financial and economic work and to ensure the completion of the Central South Region's 1950 tax revenue tasks, the Central South Tax Administration Bureau convened the Second Central South Region Tax Conference in mid-March. After listening to the reports from the directors of the tax bureaus of each province and city, the conference carefully reviewed the deviations in policy implementation that existed in the Central South Region's past tax work, and discussed and determined the future improvement measures.

Regarding the distribution of the tax burden on industry and commerce, the conference believed that in the past, due to the leading organs' lack of familiarity with the economic situation of each province and city in the Central South Region, coupled with the fact that cadres in some areas more or less held the idea of underestimating tax revenue, or a one-sided view of "benevolent governance," they mostly held the attitude of collecting as much as they could, lacking a unified plan and the spirit of actively improving work, resulting in an extremely unbalanced burden between provinces and cities, such as Guangzhou being lighter than Wuhan, and Changsha being lighter than Nanchang. In order to implement a reasonable burden, this conference determined specific figures for the tax revenue of the eight major cities of Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shantou, Wuzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Shashi, and Zhengzhou, which account for 59.92% of the total tax revenue of the Central South Region, based on the transaction volume of each city, in order to correct the deviation of the past with a wide difference in the burden between regions. At the same time, the conference also made appropriate adjustments to the burden between itinerant merchants and resident merchants, increasing the originally scheduled temporary business tax rate from 4% to 5%, in order to correct the phenomenon in many cities of having more itinerant merchants, more peddlers, and more commission shops due to the resident merchants' tax being heavier than the itinerant merchants' tax, so as to block tax evasion. This conference strictly criticized incorrect thinking and made specific decisions on the valuation standards of various goods in various regions. The conference also held extensive discussions on eliminating smuggling and tax evasion and the corruption of tax personnel, unanimously agreeing that smuggling suppression work should be strengthened, staffing should be enriched, especially in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, where tax sources are important but institutions are weak, it is necessary to enrich institutions and strengthen leadership; in order to reduce and eliminate the corruption of tax personnel, the conference decided to intensify education and transformation, and to regularly inspect the work of tax personnel, and conduct rewards and punishments.

Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, and Li Yiqing, the person in charge of the Central South Finance Committee, both attended the meeting and spoke. Vice Chairman Deng instructed that tax departments at all levels must achieve close cooperation with various government departments; tax departments cannot fight alone and should obtain the full support of the government; and that propaganda should be carried out through representatives' meetings of all sectors to break the doubts of some industrialists and businessmen so that the tax task can be completed more smoothly. Secondly, it is necessary to strictly grasp tax policies, collect taxes according to regulations, not to show favoritism, and those who conceal or evade taxes must be punished according to law. As for the staffing of tax cadres, there should be a focus, and for other non-key areas, a tax-contracting system can be adopted, that is: determine tasks and collect taxes on a quarterly basis; at the same time, industrialists and businessmen can understand their burden amount, calculate profits, and thus operate with peace of mind.

　　中南区召开第二届税务会议
    检讨税收工作偏向  贯彻合理负担政策
    【新华社汉口六日电】为贯彻执行中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定及保证完成中南区一九五○年的税收任务，中南税务管理局曾于三月中旬召开了中南区第二届税务会议。会议听取了各省、市税务局长汇报情况后，详细检讨了中南区过去税收工作中所存在的执行政策上的偏向，讨论并确定了今后的改进办法。
    在工商业税负担的分配方面，会议认为过去因领导机关对中南区各省、市的经济情况熟悉不够，加上某些地区的干部或多或少存在着轻视税收的思想，或片面的“仁政”观点，因而多抱着收多少算多少的态度，缺乏统一计划和积极改进工作的精神，以致各省、市之间的负担极不平衡，如广州比武汉轻，长沙比南昌轻。为贯彻合理负担，此次会议对占全中南区税收百分之五十九·九二的武汉、广州、汕头、梧州、长沙、南昌、沙市、郑州等八大城市的税收额，根据各城市的交易额，确定了具体数字，以纠正过去地区间负担相差悬殊的偏向。会议同时对行商、住商间的负担亦作了适当的调整，将原定临时商业税税率由百分之四提高至百分之五，以纠正过去因住商税重于行商税所造成的许多城市的行商多、摊贩多、行栈多的现象，以堵塞漏税。这次会议对不正确的思想都予以严格的批判，并对各地各种货物的估价标准做了具体决定。会议对杜绝走私漏税及税务人员的贪污问题亦曾展开广泛讨论，一致认为应加强缉私工作，充实干部配备，特别对税源重要而机构薄弱的广东、广西两省，更需充实机构，加强领导；为减少和消灭税收人员的贪污现象，会议决定除加紧教育改造外，并定期检查税收人员的工作，进行奖惩。
    中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢暨中南财委负责人李一清均莅会讲话。邓副主席指示各级税务部门必须与政府各部门取得密切配合；税务部门不能孤军作战，应取得政府的全力支持；并且要通过各界代表会，进行宣传，以打破某些工商业者的疑虑，使税收任务能更顺利地完成。其次，必须严格掌握税收政策，照章收税，不讲私情，对瞒税、漏税者必须依法惩处。至于税收干部的配备，要有重点，对其他非重点区则可采取包税制度，即：确定任务，分季征收；同时，也使工商业者可以了解自己的负担额，计算利润，因而安心营业。
