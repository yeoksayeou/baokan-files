Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council promulgated the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," governments at all levels, troops in various regions, enterprise departments, government agencies, and schools throughout the country have responded enthusiastically. In accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, they have established reorganization committees, materials inventory committees, and established trade treasuries and railway treasuries. Over the past month, significant achievements have been made in the areas of reorganization and thrift, inventory of materials, strengthening tax collection, cash deposit into the treasury, and unified allocation of materials.

　　**Reorganizing Government Agencies and Troops to Tighten Fiscal Spending**

On March 6th, the East China region first established a Establishment Committee, followed by the Southwest, Central China, and other regions. When carrying out reorganization work, various regions carefully verified the number of personnel, conscientiously checked vacancies, and formulated new establishment plans in accordance with the central government's established policy. In the new establishment plan, the number of military and government personnel in the Southwest region was greatly reduced compared to the original estimated number. Gaolan County, Gansu, conscientiously checked vacancies and found that out of the 404 personnel in the county's establishment, only 290 were actually present, with a vacancy of 114. The Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Government have both drawn more than 20 percent of their cadres to enrich grassroots organizations or transfer to production. As a result of careful calculations of financial revenue and expenditure in various regions, distinguishing between urgent and less urgent needs, significant changes have occurred in budget estimates of financial revenue and expenditure. For example, the financial expenditure budget of Huolu County was reduced by 30 percent, while the Northwest region reduced by 40 percent. All faculty and staff of Wuhan University initiated a voluntary pay cut movement, practicing the sharing of food for three people among five. Spending was tightened, living standards were lowered, and mutual assistance and production movements were launched.

　　**Inventorying Warehouse Materials to Discover Large Amounts of Assets**

Following the major event of inventorying over 10,000 freight cars on the national railways, preliminary inventory of warehouse materials in Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places have revealed a large amount of state assets that have been abandoned, unused, or rotted and damaged. The East China Telecommunications Administration alone cleared more than 50,000 boxes of equipment, worth over 130 billion yuan, during warehouse inventory. The No. 10 Factory of the China Textile Corporation in Shanghai cleared as many as 1.82 million items, including a valuable 35,000-spindle T·M high draft spinning frame. Inventory of warehouse materials in state-owned factories in Xi'an revealed a huge amount of materials that were stockpiled, with a preliminary estimate of 1.4 million "real unit" value. The Wanzai County Government in Jiangxi Province found 10,000 mu of public school land, solving the county's eight-month education funding problem. Nearly 10,000 tons of valuable steel materials were found exposed in open spaces in state-owned factories in Chongqing, some of which had been exposed for seven or eight years. In addition, important components such as a 250-ton blast furnace blower, an 8,000-horsepower steam engine, and a 60-ton crane were scattered in various places. These situations are enough to arouse high vigilance among warehouse keepers in various regions. Various regions are currently formulating concrete measures to vigorously carry out warehouse inventory work.

　　**Strengthening Tax Collection Work with Daily Increase in Tax Revenue**

In terms of tax collection work, some cadres have begun to overcome the "benevolent government" viewpoint and the idea of undervaluing tax collection work. Conscientious inspection of tax evasion and avoidance has yielded considerable results. The Wuhan Municipal Tax Bureau conducted an investigation of false accounts, revealing that 90 percent of merchants were falsifying accounts, exposing the attempt of general merchants to clamor for heavy taxes. The methods of tax collection were continuously improved, resulting in the over-fulfillment of the tax collection task for the first quarter, totaling 105.6 percent. According to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Tax Bureau, in 1949 alone, there were 1,333 cases of tax evasion and avoidance, with 650,000 jin of rice in taxes being recovered, increasing national fiscal revenue. Thanks to the conscientious and responsible work of all cadres in the Third Tax Sub-bureau of Tianjin, simplification of the tax system and tax collection procedures has been achieved, resulting in fair and reasonable burdens, and revenue has increased daily in the past four months. The collection of industrial and commercial taxes from state-owned enterprises in various regions is also being implemented conscientiously, and significant results have been achieved in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. State-owned enterprises in Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Guihua and other places have completed the payment of industrial and commercial taxes.

　　**Overall Adjustment of Grain Supply Ensures Normal Grain Supply**

The autumn grain surplus in the North China region has been transferred to the grain company for unified control. An unprecedented nationwide grain adjustment is vigorously underway. Large quantities of grain from Northeast China are entering the customs. Central China is also transporting over 200 million jin of grain to supply grain-deficient areas in North China, East China, and the two Guangdongs. Hunan Province has decided to transport the best grain from areas with convenient transportation to other provinces. At the same time, in order to facilitate leadership of the province's grain transportation work, a grain transportation headquarters has been jointly formed by the Grain Company, Shipping Company, Central China Grain Company, and other units. The grain problem in major cities has been resolved. Grain prices are no longer subject to speculation by private merchants.

　　**Unified Cash Management Reduces Blind Investment**

In terms of unified cash management, trade treasuries and specialized county sub-treasuries have been established in major cities in North China, East China, and Central South China. Railway treasuries in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiangxi and other places have also been established. The Hankou Trade Sub-treasury deposited over 100 billion yuan in cash in ten days, the Changsha Trade Sub-treasury deposited 7 billion yuan in a single day on the 14th of last month, and the Zhengzhou Trade Sub-treasury deposited 14 billion yuan in two weeks. Cash transfers must be uniformly allocated by the Central Trade Department or the Railway Department, reducing the blindness of the investment market and directly playing a role in stabilizing prices. According to statistics from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, the total amount of money received by the bank on behalf of various state-owned enterprises in the past month has reached 1,609.4 billion yuan. Within a month, the deposit figures of the People's Bank of China reached 60 percent of the total amount of currency issued. This has created conditions for the government to plan and regulate financial expenditures, while also reducing the amount of currency issued.

　　**Completing Currency Withdrawal and Stabilization of Prices in Various Regions**

Under the general policy of "accelerating commodity sales and completing currency withdrawal," professional companies and trade companies in various regions examined the conservative idea of stockpiling goods and launched a sales boom. Methods such as simplifying sales procedures, extending sales hours, removing purchase quantity limits, going deep into rural temple fairs, and developing consignment households through cooperatives were adopted to achieve the currency withdrawal task. Currently, market prices in various regions are tending to stabilize and fall, with prices in major cities falling by an average of 12 percent in one month. According to the comparison between the fourth week of March and the fourth week of February in Tianjin, the wholesale price index in North China has decreased by a strong 4.9 percent. During the same period, the workers' cost of living index decreased by 13.2 percent. This economic situation is not only beneficial to the lives of the broad masses of people, but also particularly beneficial to developing national production and strengthening construction work.

　　一个月来各地认真执行统一财经决定的成绩
    中央人民政府政务院颁布“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”以后，全国各级政府、各地部队、各企业部门、机关、学校等一致热烈响应；并依照政务院指示，纷纷成立整编委员会、物资清理委员会、建立贸易金库及铁路金库等。一个月以来，在整编节约、清理物资、加强税收、现金缴库、统一物资调拨等工作上，已取得显著成绩。
    整编机关部队  紧缩财政开支
    三月六日，华东区首先成立了编制委员会，西南、华中等区也相继成立。各地在执行整编工作时，审慎核实人数，认真检查空额，依照中央规定的编制方针从新拟定编制计划。新编制计划中，西南区军政人员名额，较原估计的名额已大为减少。甘肃皋兰认真检查空额，发现全县编制四百零四人中，实有二百九十人，缺额达一百一十四人之多。兰州市委机关及重庆市府机关，都抽出了百分之二十以上的干部充实下层机构或转入生产。各地对财政收支分别缓急精打细算的结果，财政收支概算已发生巨大变化，如获鹿县财政开支预算减少了三成，西北区则减少了十分之四。武汉大学全体教职员工发起自愿减薪运动，实行三个人的饭五个人匀着吃。紧缩开支，降低生活水平，并展开互助运动与生产运动。
    清查仓库物资  发现大量资财
    在全国铁路清查出货车万余辆这一重大事件之后，继之在上海、重庆、西安等地初步清查仓库物资的结果，均已发现大量的国家资财被弃置未用或腐烂毁坏。仅华东电信管理局一个单位，在清理仓库时即清理出器材五万余箱，价值一千三百余亿元。上海中纺公司第十厂清理出的物资达一百八十二万件之多，其中发现一部名贵的三万五千锭Ｔ·Ｍ大牵伸机。西安清理公营工厂仓库物资，发现巨额物资被积压，初步估计，价值一百四十万个折实单位。江西万载县府，查出公产学田万亩，解决了全县八个月的教育经费。重庆公营工厂中发现近万吨贵重的钢铁器材露置空场，有的已暴露七、八年之久。另有二百五十吨的炼铁炉鼓风机、八千马力的蒸汽机、六十吨的吊车等重要机件散失各地。这些情况足以引起各地仓库保管人员的高度警惕。各地区目前正拟定具体办法，大力进行清查仓库工作。
    加强税收工作  税款收入日增
    税收工作方面，在一部分干部中开始克服了“仁政”观点和轻视税收工作的思想，认真检查漏税偷税的工作，已收到不少成绩，武汉市税局进行了查假账的工作，查明百分之九十的商户造假账，揭破了一般商人叫嚣税重的企图，并在稽征工作中不断改进方法，结果第一季税收任务超额完成，总计完成百分之一零五点六。石家庄税务局统计一九四九年一年内，偷税漏税的违章案件达一千三百三十三件，补缴了税米六十五万斤，增加了国家财政收入。天津市第三税务分局由于全体干部认真负责，做到简化税制及稽征手续，达到负担的公平合理，四个月来使收入逐日上升。各地征收公营企业工商业税的工作，亦在认真实行，上海、天津、北京等地且已收到显著成绩。天津、张家口、归绥等地公营企业已将工商税缴纳完毕。
    通盘调剂粮食  粮食供应正常
    华北区秋征余粮，已拨交粮食公司统一掌握，空前规模的全国粮食通盘调剂正大力进行中。东北食粮大量进关。华中亦运拨食粮二亿余斤供应华北、华东及两广缺粮地区。湖南省决将全省交通便利地区的好粮运往外省，同时为便于领导全省运粮工作，已由粮食公司、航运公司、华中粮食公司等单位联合组成运粮指挥部。各大城市食粮问题已得到解决。粮价不再受私商投机操纵的影响。
    统一现金管理  减少盲目投资
    在统一现金管理方面，华北、华东、中南区各大城市均已建立贸易金库及专、县支库。上海、杭州、江西等地的铁道金库也已建立起来。汉口贸易分库十天纳库现金千余亿，长沙贸易分库上月十四日一天入库七十亿，郑州贸易分库半个月内入库一百四十亿。解库现金均须由中央贸易部或铁道部统一支配，减少了投资市场的盲目性，直接起了平抑物价的作用。据人民银行总行统计，最近一个月代理各公营企业收款总额已达一万六千零九十四亿元。一个月内，人民银行存款数字，已达到了货币全部发行量的百分之六十。这样就造成了使政府有计划地调剂财政支出的条件，同时也减少了通货发行的数字。
    完成通货回笼  各地物价稳落
    在“加速商品推销、完成通货回笼”的总方针下，各地专业公司和贸易公司检查了囤货的保守思想，掀起销货热潮。采用简化卖货手续，延长售货时间，取消购货数量限制，深入农村庙会，通过合作社，发展代销户等方式，以达成通货回笼任务。目前各地市场物价均趋稳落，各大城市物价在一个月内平均下落了百分之十二。据天津三月份第四周与二月份第四周的比较，华北批发物价指数已降低百分之四点九强。同时期，工人生活费指数降低百分之十三·二。这一经济情势，不仅对广大人民生活是有利的，同时对发展国家生产，加强建设工作尤为有利。
