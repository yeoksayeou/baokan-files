　　Notice from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Commemorating "May Day" International Labor Day

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on the 22nd to the general trade unions (or offices) of major administrative regions, various industrial trade unions, and their subordinate trade union organizations regarding the commemoration of "May Day" International Labor Day. The full text is as follows:

    The great "May Day" International Labor Day—the festival for the working class of the world to review its fighting strength—is coming soon. This year's "May Day" International Labor Day is the first "May Day" after the Chinese working class, under the wise leadership of its political party—the Chinese Communist Party—and its leader—Chairman Mao, united the people of the whole country and won the national liberation victory after nearly thirty years of heroic struggle. The reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat capital, which had long oppressed us, has been overthrown. A genuine people's regime has been established. In political terms, the Chinese working class has transformed from an oppressed and enslaved position to the leading class of the state power. In economic terms, workers in state-owned factories and enterprises directly participate in production management; in private factories and enterprises, they are no longer oppressed or subjected to unlimited exploitation. In terms of living standards, the people's government has implemented a system of payment in kind, reducing the suffering of past price fluctuations; in particular, it is now overcoming twelve years of inflation, stabilizing prices, and providing greater security for the lives of workers and staff. In the Northeast, it has already embarked on the path of restoring and developing production, not only fundamentally solving the unemployment problem but also feeling a shortage of labor, and is recruiting a large number of skilled workers from within the customs. The actual wages of workers and staff in the Northeast have been gradually increasing, and a labor insurance system has been implemented, with various cultural and welfare undertakings being organized. The workers in the Northeast have begun to live good lives. We believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao Zedong, as long as our workers and the people of the whole country unite and work together, the economy of the entire China will surely recover and develop rapidly like the Northeast, and gradually embark on a path of prosperity. This is our bright future. This is the harvest of our great victory.

    However, due to the extreme hatred of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, desperately supported by U.S. imperialism, for the victory of the Chinese people, they are attempting to destroy our victory fruits with crazy means such as blockade and bombing to achieve their dying struggle and prolong their existence; due to the long-term war damage suffered by the vast rural areas, coupled with the serious floods in many areas last year, and the land reform has not yet been carried out, the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers is very low; due to the inevitable decline of some industrial and commercial enterprises that originally catered to the corrupt enjoyment of imperialism, bureaucrat bourgeoisie, and feudal landlords, coupled with the recent price stability, it has created unfavorable conditions for some speculative industrial and commercial operators who have always relied on inflation for profit, resulting in some factories and shops suspending work and closing down. All of this has created the current economic difficulties in our country and increased the suffering of some of our unemployed workers and staff. However, these difficulties are temporary, difficulties we encounter in our victory and advance, and difficulties that can be gradually overcome in the near future. As long as we thoroughly annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, recover Hainan Island and Taiwan, as long as the farmers achieve a bumper harvest this year and their purchasing power is substantially restored, things can begin to improve, and after the completion of the land revolution and the improvement of farmers' purchasing power, and after the rational adjustment of industry and commerce, things can fundamentally improve. What is particularly gratifying is that we have obtained a great ally—the Soviet Union. With the Soviet Union's assistance in all aspects, especially in the economic and production technology aspects, it will be easier for us to overcome difficulties and restore and develop production. Chairman Mao said: We "have difficulties, have solutions, and have hope. ... Within three to five years, our economic undertakings can be completely restored; within ten to eight years, our economy can achieve great development." Therefore, when commemorating "May Day" International Labor Day this year, the working class of the whole country must closely unite with the people of the whole country to overcome the current difficulties, consolidate our acquired victory fruits, and carry out the following combat tasks:

    First, continue to work hard to support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Hainan Island, Tibet, and Taiwan, and completely and finally eliminate the nest of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that poisons the Chinese people.

    Second, support the vast number of farmers in suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, reducing rent and interest, and preparing for the land reform struggle, and assist the disaster-stricken farmers. Only by liberating the farmers from feudal oppression, improving agricultural production, and raising the living standards of the farmers can industry have the conditions for development, and the lives of workers can be improved.

    Third, support the government's policy of unifying finance and economy, actively participate in the inventory of warehouse materials and assist the government's tax collection work, overcome the country's financial difficulties, and strive for permanent price stability. Only in this way can the country systematically and gradually restore production.

    Fourth, intensify production and strive for economy. In state-owned and public enterprises, the working class must learn to manage enterprises, actively participate in the transformation of old enterprises into people's enterprises, launch a rationalization proposal movement, give full play to the initiative and creativity of the working class, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. In private enterprises, take the initiative to consult with the capitalists based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, find solutions, and jointly assume the responsibility of overcoming difficulties and weathering the storm.

    Fifth, consolidate the closer unity between the Chinese working class and the working class of the world, first of all, closer union with the working class of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, welcome the Soviet Union's various assistance to us, and strengthen friendship and cooperation with the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, so that imperialism will not dare to have any more ambitions to invade China, and we can defend the peace of the Far East and the world. At the same time, we must carry forward the great spirit of internationalism and support the struggles of the working classes in Asian countries who are still suffering from imperialist oppression.

    Finally, we must use the spirit of unity, fraternity, and mutual assistance of the working class of the whole country to voluntarily donate money to help unemployed workers in Shanghai and major cities!

    All trade union organizations across the country should immediately carry out and arrange the following tasks after receiving this notice:

    I. All trade union organizations should, based on the key points mentioned in this notice, hold various meetings in factories and enterprises before "May Day," or by region, to report and discuss the significance and tasks of this year's "May Day" commemoration, and conduct extensive, in-depth, and mass-oriented propaganda and education work.

    II. Mass rallies and demonstrations should be held in all cities and industrial areas across the country on "May Day" to review and mobilize the fighting strength of the masses.

    III. Various entertainment evenings can be organized by trade unions on the evening of "May Day" in various local and larger factories. This entertainment evening should become a mass celebration evening, paying special attention to entertaining model workers in production, and not becoming an entertainment evening for a few cadres.

    IV. The Workers' Daily and newspapers published by trade union organizations in various places should publish "May Day" special issues, and pay attention to organizing more contributions from the working masses.

　　中华全国总工会
    关于纪念“五一”国际劳动节的通知
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国总工会于二十二日向各大行政区总工会（或办事处）、各产业工会并所属各级工会组织发出关于纪念“五一”国际劳动节的通知，全文如下：
    全世界工人阶级检阅自己战斗力量的节日——伟大的“五一”国际劳动节就要到来了。今年的“五一”国际劳动节，是中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党和自己的领袖——毛主席的英明领导之下，团结全国人民，经过了将近三十年的英勇奋斗，获得全国解放胜利后的第一个“五一”节。长期压榨我们的帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的反动统治，已被打倒了。真正人民政权已经建立起来了。中国工人阶级，在政治方面，已经从被压迫被奴役的地位变成了国家政权的领导阶级。在经济方面，工人在公营工厂企业中，直接参加着生产管理；在私营工厂企业中，也不再受压迫，不再受无限制的剥削了。在生活方面，由于人民政府实行了实物工资制度，减少了过去物价波动的痛苦；特别是现在正克服着十二年来的通货膨胀，使物价平稳起来，使职工生活更有保障了。而在东北，业已走上恢复和发展生产的轨道，不仅根本解决了失业问题，而且已感到劳动力的缺乏，正在关内招收大量技术工人。东北职工所得的实际工资已在逐步增加；并且实行了劳动保险制度，举办着各种文化、福利事业。东北的工友们已开始过好的日子了。我们相信，在中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导之下，只要我们工人和全国人民团结一致，共同努力，整个中国的经济，也一定会像东北一样，很快地恢复和发展起来，而逐渐走上繁荣的道路。这就是我们的光明前途。这就是我们伟大的胜利的收获。
    但是，由于美帝国主义所拚命支持的蒋匪残余，对于中国人民胜利的极端仇视，企图用封锁、轰炸等疯狂手段破坏我们的胜利果实，来达到他们临死挣扎、苟延残喘的目的；由于广大农村遭受长期战争破坏，加上去年有不少地区遭受着重大的水灾，土地改革又还没有进行，因之广大农民的购买力很低；由于原来专供帝国主义、官僚资产阶级和封建地主腐化享乐的一部分工商业趋于必不可免的衰落，加上最近物价稳定，对于向来依靠通货膨胀营利的一部分投机工商业者造成不利的情况，而发生一些工厂商店停工停业的现象。所有这一切就造成了目前我们国家在经济方面的困难，增加了我们一部分工人职员失业的痛苦。然而，这种困难是暂时的，是我们胜利中与前进中遇到的困难，并且是不久将来就可以逐渐克服的困难。只要彻底歼灭蒋匪，收复海南岛和台湾，只要农民今年获得丰收，购买力相当恢复，便可开始好转，而到土地革命完成，农民购买力提高，工商业得到合理调整以后，便可根本好转。尤其值得庆幸的是，我们获得了伟大盟国——苏联，有苏联在各方面，首先是在经济方面、生产技术方面对我们的援助，使我们克服困难、恢复和发展生产都会比较容易些。毛主席说：我们是“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。……在三五年的时间内，我们的经济事业可以完全恢复；在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”因此，在今年纪念“五一”国际劳动节的时候，全国工人阶级要紧密地与全国人民团结在一起，为克服当前的困难，巩固我们已得的胜利果实，而执行下列各项战斗任务：
    第一，继续努力支援人民解放军，解放海南岛、西藏和台湾等全部国土，彻底地最后地消灭美帝国主义和他的走狗蒋介石匪帮毒害中国人民的巢穴。
    第二，支持广大农民剿匪反霸，减租减息与准备土地改革的斗争，援助受灾的农民，只有使农民从封建压迫下解放出来，提高农业生产，提高农民的生活水平，工业才有发展条件，工人生活也才能得到改善。
    第三，拥护政府统一财政经济的政策，积极参加仓库物资的清点与协助政府的税收工作，克服国家的财政困难，争取物价的永久稳定。只有如此，才能使国家有计划地逐步地恢复生产事业。
    第四，加紧生产努力节约。在国营、公营企业中，工人阶级要学会管理企业，积极参加改造旧企业为人民企业的各项工作，开展合理化建议运动，发挥工人阶级的积极性与创造性，提高产量、质量与减低成本。在私营企业中，要主动地根据劳资两利的原则，与资方进行协商，找出办法，共同负起克服困难、渡过难关的责任。
    第五，巩固中国工人阶级与全世界工人阶级更紧密的团结，首先是与社会主义国家苏联的工人阶级更密切的联合起来，学习苏联的先进经验，欢迎苏联对我们的各种援助，并且加强和东欧各新民主主义国家的友谊合作，就能使帝国主义不敢再起侵略中国的野心，就能保卫远东和世界和平。同时，我们要发扬伟大的国际主义精神，支援亚洲各国家中现在仍在遭受帝国主义压迫的工人阶级的斗争。
    最后，我们要用全国工人阶级团结友爱的精神与互助力量，自动捐款救济上海和各大城市的失业工友！
    全国各工会组织，在接到本通知后，应立即进行和布置下列各项工作：
    一、各工会组织，应根据本通知中所述各项要点，于“五一”前在工厂企业中，或按地区，举行各种会议，报告与讨论今年纪念“五一”的意义和任务，进行广泛的深入的群众性的宣传教育工作。
    二、在全国各城市各工业区，都应在“五一”这一天举行群众大会和示威游行，以便检阅与动员群众的战斗力量。
    三、各地各较大工厂中，可以在“五一”节的晚间由工会组织各种娱乐晚会。此项娱乐晚会，应成为群众的庆祝晚会，特别注意招待在生产方面的模范工作者，而不要变成少数干部的娱乐晚会。
    四、工人日报及各地工会组织出版之报纸，应出“五一”特刊，并应注意多组织工人群众的稿件。
