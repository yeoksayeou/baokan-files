　　“Strive for Production, Support Our Farmer Brothers!”
    — A Record of the Baoding Railway Workers' Visit to the Disaster Area
    Zhang Guifang
    On February 23rd, eleven railway worker representatives from Baoding City formed a disaster area visiting delegation to visit the living conditions of the disaster victims in the heavily affected area of Ninghe County. After arriving in Ninghe County, the eleven people were divided into two groups and went to the first and third districts separately. We walked through a lot of muddy slurry on a small road that rose above a vast expanse of water before reaching Ailin Village in the third district.
    Most of the disaster victims in Ailin Village were eating porridge or cakes made from bran. The children ate porridge while blowing the bran floating on top of their small mouths. The faces of the disaster victims were yellow, and their physical strength was somewhat unsustainable. Later, we went to Xiao Cong Village. When the wife of military dependent Wang Huizhan saw us visiting her, she said with a mixture of joy and sorrow, "You are so kind!" After a long pause, she said hesitantly, "When I see you young people, I can't help but think of my two sons who sacrificed themselves on the front lines!" At that time, Shi Zhaohui, a worker from the Baoding Telegraph Section, said, "Old lady, don't be sad, we are like your sons! As long as our country is good, you old folks will have plenty to eat. We will definitely work hard to produce more when we go back, so that the lives of the old ladies can be improved. Isn't this the same as what your sons did? We will definitely save things from our daily lives to help you. Wasn't it the strength of the broad masses of farmer brothers who joined the army, supported the front lines, and sacrificed everything that liberated us workers?" The old lady stared at Shi Zhaohui's excited face and nodded repeatedly, shedding tears. Then, we went to Qian Da'an Village, Hou Da'an Village, and six other villages. The disaster situation was not much different.
    After the disaster area visiting delegation returned to Baoding, they introduced the suffering of the disaster victims in Ninghe County to all the railway workers. The general workers responded: "We eat our fill, if we don't work hard to produce more, we will be letting down the farmer brothers who have suffered." "If it weren't for the vast number of farmer brothers joining the army and supporting the front, we workers would not have been liberated so quickly. Now that our brothers have suffered a flood, we should save money to help them." "Striving for production is helping!" This not only increased the workers' enthusiasm for production, but also emphasized saving materials. When wages were paid that month, many workers voluntarily contributed money to disaster relief. All departments of the Baoding Railway contributed a total of 7,000 jin of millet, and donations are still being made.

　　“努力生产，支援农民弟兄！”
    ——保定铁路工人访问灾区记
    张桂芳
    二月二十三日，保定市的十一位铁路工人代表，组织了灾区访问团，赴宁河县重灾区访问灾民的生活情形。到宁河县后，十一个人划成了两个小组，分头到一、三两区。我们在一片大水当中高起的一条小路上走过了许多浆水泥泞，才到三区艾林庄。
    艾林庄的大部灾民吃的是用糠皮子煮的粥或做的饼，孩子们一面吃粥一面把小嘴吹着上面飘着的糠皮。灾民们的脸色发黄，体力也有些不能支持。后来我们又到了小从村，军属王惠占的老婆见到我们去看她，带着又高兴又悲伤的表情说：“你们真好呵！”停了半天又吞吐的说：“我看到你们年轻人，可就要想起牺牲在前方的两个儿子啦！”当时保定电务段的工人石兆惠说：“老大娘不要伤心，我们就像你的儿子一样呵！只要我们的国家好了，你老人家就有得吃了。我们回去一定努力生产，让老大娘们的生活改善，这不是和你的儿子一样吗？我们回去一定把日常生活中节省下来的东西救济你们。我们工人得到解放，还不是农民弟兄们的参加军队、支援前线、牺牲一切的力量吗？”老大娘巴巴的看着石兆惠激动的脸色，不住的点着头，流下了眼泪。接着，我们又到了前大安村、后大安村等六个村庄，受灾的情形都相差不远。
    灾区访问团回保定后，向铁路的全体工人介绍了宁河县灾区灾民受苦的情形。一般工人反映：“咱们吃得饱饱的，再不努力生产，也对不住受灾的农民弟兄。”“要不是广大的农民弟兄的参军、支前，咱们工人也不会解放得这样快，现在咱们的弟兄遭了水灾，咱们就应当节省出钱来救济他们。”“努力生产，就是救济啊！”不但提高了工人的生产热情，还重视了节省材料。当月开支工资时，有许多工人都自觉的出钱救灾，保定市铁路各部分共拿出小米七千斤，现在还有陆续捐助的。
