Taiyuan Railway Bureau Organizes Masses to Contract Work
    Saving 210,000 Catties of Millet

[Reported by this newspaper] The Taiyuan Railway Bureau directly organized the masses to make 10,000 boundary markers, which not only reduced exploitation by merchants and saved more than 200,000 catties of millet, but also helped the masses with winter production. The boundary markers along the stations and roadbeds of the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines under the bureau's jurisdiction were mostly damaged. In order to protect the integrity of railway property and strengthen road maintenance, in addition to jointly planning with local governments along the lines in accordance with the former North China People's Government's "Roadbed Land Retention Measures," it was also decided to restore 10,000 boundary markers along the line. In November of last year, the Bureau's Industrial Department solicited bids from merchants in Taiyuan several times, with the highest price being 70 catties of millet per boundary marker and the lowest being 28 catties. Later, people were sent to Niushan Village in Huolu County, Hebei Province, to organize stonemasons and farmers to contract the work. As a result, including transportation costs, the price per marker was only equivalent to slightly more than 7 catties of millet. The work has now been completed, saving a total of more than 200,999 catties of millet.

　　太原铁路局组织群众包工
    节米廿一万斤
    【本报讯】太原铁路局直接组织群众打界石一万个，既减少商人从中剥削，节省小米二十万零九千余斤，且扶助了群众冬季生产。该局所辖正太、同蒲两线各站及路基两侧土地，界石大都损坏。为保护路产完整，加强养路工作，除按前华北人民政府“路基留地办法”会同沿线各级政府进行策划外，并决定恢复沿线界石一万个。该局产业科于年前十一月间，在太原数次招商承包，最高价格是每个界石七十斤米，最低的也要二十八斤。后即派人往河北获鹿县牛山村一带，组织石工及农民包做，结果连运费在内，每个价仅合小米七斤强，现已全部完工，计节省开支二十万零九千九百余斤米。
