《China's Young Pioneers》Issue No. 12

　　The bi-weekly 《China's Young Pioneers》Issue No. 12 was published on April 1st. The main contents of this issue reflect the achievements and activities of the Young Pioneers since its establishment. The editorial points out that with the life education of the organization and the enthusiastic guidance of the teachers, the members have made progress in learning, discipline, and unity and mutual assistance. It also calls on the members to cherish the organization and continue to unite and make progress. Other reports such as “Why is Anli Crying,” “Radiating Brightly,” and “Living Happily in Our Organization” are all related to this aspect. The story of natural and social development published in each issue is based on the level of young children, from the development of organisms to the development of human society, with the purpose of establishing a materialistic worldview for young children. The title of this issue is "The Development of Organisms to the Single-Cell Stage." "Come and See the Earth's Shadow" tells the story of the total lunar eclipse on April 3rd. "Chairman Mao and Soviet Children" records Chairman Mao's warm reception by Soviet children in the Soviet Union: countless Soviet Young Pioneers wrote letters to Chairman Mao, requesting Chairman Mao to be their honorary member; a little girl from Irkutsk, on behalf of all the Young Pioneers in their school, put a red scarf on Chairman Mao.

　　《中国少年儿童》第十二期
    《中国少年儿童》双周刊第十二期已于四月一日出版，本期主要内容是反映建立少年儿童队以来的成绩和队的活动。社论中指出了队员们因有了队的生活教育和老师们的热心辅导，在学习、纪律、团结互助各方面都有了进步，并号召队员们要爱护组织，继续团结进步。其他“安利为什么哭”、“大放光明”、“快乐地生活在自己的组织里”都是有关这方面的报导。每期刊载的自然社会发展的故事是根据少年儿童的水平，从生物的发展写到人类社会的发展，目的是建立少年儿童唯物主义的宇宙观，本期的题目是“生物发展到单细胞阶段”。“快来看地球的影子”是讲述四月三日月全食的事情。“毛主席和苏联儿童”记毛主席在苏联，受到苏联少年儿童的热烈爱戴：苏联无数的少年先锋队员给毛主席写信，请求毛主席为他们的名誉队员；伊尔库斯克的一个小姑娘，代表她们学校的全体少先队员，给毛主席带上了红领巾。
