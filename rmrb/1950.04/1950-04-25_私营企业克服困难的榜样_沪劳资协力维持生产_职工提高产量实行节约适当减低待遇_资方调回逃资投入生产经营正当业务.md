　　Private Enterprises Set an Example of Overcoming Difficulties
    Shanghai Labor and Management Work Together to Maintain Production
    Employees Increase Output, Practice Economy, and Appropriately Reduce Compensation
    Capitalists Recall Fleeing Capital and Invest in Production and Legitimate Business
    [Our Newspaper] Shanghai private enterprises, in order to overcome current temporary difficulties, are actively establishing consultation mechanisms and signing agreements, working together to maintain production. Improvements are already evident in some industries. As of mid-month, seventeen major industries in the city, including wool spinning, rubber, silk weaving, cigarette rolling, knitting, enamel, cotton spinning, pharmaceuticals, dyeing and weaving, finance, hospitals, restaurants, fashion, matches, hotels, shipping, and glass, have established industry-wide labor-management agreement organizations. Industries such as towel blankets, underwear weaving, paper making, chemical raw materials, textile products, and tea are in the process of organizing. Several dozen individual enterprises, including Peace Machinery Factory, Yongsheng Iron Factory, Kaimeike Pharmaceutical Factory, China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, Hengfeng, Shen Wu and other yarn factories, and Xie Xingxiang Silk Factory, have also established labor-management consultation mechanisms. In the aforementioned industries, after the agreements were established, both labor and management deeply realized the actual difficulties currently existing in their respective industries, but also that they were not impossible to overcome, thereby increasing their confidence in management. In particular, some industries are needed by the broad masses of the people and have great prospects for the future. Employees are able to think from the perspective of long-term interests, work hard to produce, practice strict economy, and in some particularly difficult enterprises, employees voluntarily reduce their salaries appropriately, while capitalists improve their business and increase capital, thus preventing many industrial and commercial enterprises from closing down and continuing to maintain production. For example, Hongchang Silk Factory and Lifeng Woolen Mill, which originally planned to evacuate, have shifted to maintaining production. Yongda, Yida Silk Factory, Shen Yuanxin and other factories have resolved disputes through agreements to tighten production or carry out evacuation. Among the dyeing and weaving industries, employees of fifteen factories including China Industrial, China Underwear Factory, etc., some employees and staff have reduced their salaries by 45%, some workers have given up wages for days off from shifts, some have discounted their salaries according to the amount of their wages, some have reduced the quality of their meals, and some have voluntarily extended their working hours without pay in order to maintain production. When the employees of Guohua Bank saw that the capitalists were indeed confident in overcoming difficulties, they considered restoring the discount method implemented in September of last year. After labor and management reached a preliminary agreement on March 10, the capitalists immediately transferred HK$250,000 from Hong Kong; within March, they transferred HK$750,000 in Hong Kong dollars in three installments. In addition to having paid off all the government bonds, they are preparing to make up for all the bad debts. After the capitalists of Yisheng Trading Company fled to Hong Kong, only a few materials and cash were left, and it seemed inevitable that the company would collapse. The employees then strove to have an enlightened capitalist come from Wuhan to Shanghai to conduct negotiations. The employees were willing to reduce each yuan of base salary from 1.8 folding units to 1 folding unit, and were willing to assist in promoting business. As a result, the business has made significant progress. Xinhua Department Store borrowed usurious loans to purchase goods in early November last year, and later its liabilities exceeded its assets, and salaries could not be paid. At this time, in order to unite the capitalists to continue operating, the employees not only allowed the salaries to be delayed, but also cancelled regular holidays, and launched a movement to borrow money to repay debts. However, the capitalists still lacked confidence and fled one after another. In addition to sending people to find them, the trade union also requested the board of directors to send someone to preside over the matter, while calling on employees to maintain assets and establish a responsible system for each department, reducing the price of luxury goods and selling daily necessities for the masses, and the turnover increased from one million yuan per day to more than ten million yuan. All employees of the Mainland Gongji Transportation Company voluntarily reduced their salaries, worked actively, and saved unnecessary expenses, giving the capitalists confidence and dispelling the idea of ​​dismissal and shutdown, and they were also willing to increase their capital by 20 million yuan. Over the past month, they have gradually achieved a balance of payments. In order to strengthen its business, the capitalist has sold the original 20 bolts of white cloth as working capital. Shen Baohe Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, owned by Shen Hefu, who also works as a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, originally only did business and did not purchase goods due to lack of confidence, withdrawing 1,700 units of capital. His wife also shouted "Eat it all up!" and was in arrears with wages. After the employees patiently persuaded him, an agreement was signed on the 3rd of this month, and 6 shi of "savings and mutual aid funds" and private food rice were lent out, enabling him to quickly complete the payment of government bonds and taxes. He also began to do his best as a doctor. As a result, the turnover has increased by 12.5% and there is a surplus. Shen Hefu often said to the employees: "Your thinking is better than mine, and I am willing to learn from you." Da Sanyuan Restaurant, because the capitalist was unwilling to accept the employees' suggestion to change its extravagant and luxurious management method, always wanted to "not open for three years, but eat for three years when it opens", and finally fled because of excessive losses. Later, the employees changed to selling set meals and snacks, facing the broad masses of the people. Since March 27, the turnover has increased by 50%. In half a month, in addition to paying off all debts, they not only do not owe wages, but also have 4 dan of rice and 9 bags of flour in stock. Shanghai's financial industry has organized joint lending, and recently has twice jointly issued agricultural loans, giving capital a legitimate outlet.

　　私营企业克服困难的榜样
    沪劳资协力维持生产
    职工提高产量实行节约适当减低待遇
    资方调回逃资投入生产经营正当业务
    【本报讯】上海市私营企业劳资双方为了战胜目前暂时困难，正纷纷建立协商机构，签订协议，协力维持生产，部分行业已有好转现象。截至本月中旬末，全市已有毛纺、橡胶、丝织、卷烟、针织、搪瓷、棉纺、制药、染织、金融、医院、酒菜、时装、火柴、旅社、航运、玻璃等十七个主要行业成立了全业性的劳资协议组织；尚有毛巾被毯、内衣织造、造纸、化工原料、纺织用品、茶业等行业正在进行组织。单位企业中亦有平和机器厂、永生铁工厂、开美科制药厂、中国生化制药厂、恒丰、申五等纱厂、协兴祥绸厂等数十家成立了劳资协商机构。上述各行业中，有的在协议成立后，由于劳资双方均能深切认识到当前各该业所存在的实际困难，并非不可能克服，提高了经营的信心；特别是有些行业系为广大人民所需要，将来有很大前途。职工们均能从长远利益着想，努力生产，厉行节约，在有些特别困难的企业中，职工们自愿适当减低薪资，同时资方则改进营业，增加资本，因而使许多工商业免于倒闭，继续维持了生产。例如：洪昌绸厂，立丰毛织厂等原拟疏散，已经转变到维持生产。永达、一大绸厂、申源新等厂经过协议紧缩生产或进行疏散已经解决了纠纷。染织业中中国实业、中国内衣厂等十五厂职工，职员有的减薪百分之四十五，工人有的放弃轮班制停工日的工资，有的按工薪多少分别折扣支薪，有的减低伙食质量，有的自动延长工时而不取工资，维持了生产。国华银行职工见到资方对克服困难已确有信心，遂考虑将工资恢复去年九月份所施行的折扣办法，在三月十日劳资初步获得协议后，十一日资方即自香港调回港币二十五万元；三月份内，前后三次调回七十五万港币，除已将公债全部缴清外，准备将全部呆欠补平。义生贸易公司资方逃到香港后，仅剩下少数物资及现金，眼看势必垮台，职工便争取了一位开明资方由汉来沪进行协商，职工愿意将每元底薪由一·八个折实单位减为一个折实单位，并愿协助推展业务，结果是业务有了显著进展。新华百货公司在去年十一月初借高利贷进货，后负债多于资产，薪金不能发出，这时职工为团结资方继续经营，除允许薪资延宕外，并取消例假，同时发起借金还债运动，而资方仍乏信心，相继潜逃；工会除派人寻觅外，并向董监事会要求派员主持，同时号召职工维护资产，确立各部门负责制度，把奢侈品抑价售脱，改售大众日用品，营业额遂由每日百万元增至一千余万元。大陆公记运输行全体职工自动减薪、积极工作，节省了不必要的开支，使资方有了信心，打消了遣散停业的意见，而且还愿增加资金二千万元，一个多月来已逐步做到收支平衡。目前资方为加强营业，已将原存白布二十匹出售充作流动资金。沈保和国药号资方沈和甫兼作中医师，原来因为缺乏信心，只做生意并不进货，抽去了资金一千七百个单位。其妻又高喊“吃光完结”。拖欠工资。经职工耐心劝解，于本月三日签订协议，并借出“储蓄互助金”及私人食米共六石，使他迅速完成了公债税收。他也开始尽力做医生。因此，营业额已经增加了百分之十二点五，而且有了盈余。沈和甫常对职工们说：“你们思想比我好，我愿跟你们学习。”大三元酒菜馆，因资方不愿接受职工建议而改变其奢侈豪华的经营方法，总想“三年不开张，开张吃三年”，最后终至亏累太大而逃之夭夭，后经职工改卖客饭点心，面向广大人民，从三月二十七日以来，营业额提高了百分之五十，半月光景除还清一切债务外，目前不仅做到不欠薪，并且存有米四担、面粉九包。上海金融业组织了联合放款，最近曾两次联合发放农业贷款，使资金有了正当出路。
