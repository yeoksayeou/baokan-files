Our Good Friend Moglaff
Anshan Iron and Steel Works  Xue Siqin

　　Moglaff, the Soviet expert who was hired to come to the Iron and Steel Works last year, was a stranger to our workers when he first arrived. After he gave a speech at the general meeting, the workers became familiar with him. Afterwards, whenever he went to the site, everyone would come to talk to him or discuss technology. Once they started talking, they couldn't stop.

　　In mid-September of last year, Old Liu, who operates the blower, was in the blower house, making the blower "roar". Soviet expert Moglaff pushed the door open and came in. Old Liu looked up and saw "Big Brother" and nodded to him with a smile, pointing to a wooden chair for him to sit down. Moglaff nodded with a smile, sat on the chair, and said in his broken Chinese, "Hey! Liu, where have you been these days? You haven't been working here." Old Liu smiled and teased him, "I haven't seen you either! I went to the South Plant for ten days." "Hmm! How many years have you been doing this?" "Ha! Enough for twenty-eight years!" Moglaff asked, "Do you understand pressure and temperature?" Old Liu blushed and shook his head, "Not at all!" Moglaff asked, "Why don't you study?" Old Liu said with a sad face, "Study? When I was learning, it was all Japanese devils, who would let you study?" Then, he smiled and said to Moglaff, "Never mind, just tell me!" Moglaff nodded and started explaining to him, two times, three times, until he finally taught Old Liu. This matter spread to every workshop, making every worker more deeply aware of the help our Soviet comrades are giving us. From then on, it was even more common to see Engineer Moglaff and the workers studying technology together with their heads lowered.

　　In October, fitter Old Lü was making a mud grinding machine for the blast furnace—a very important machine for the production of iron. It used to break down frequently, requiring repairs every three days or so, and each repair would severely delay production. Moreover, each repair would exhaust everyone, so no one was willing to repair it. This time, after Old Lü unloaded the work and transported it to the site, he was a little worried looking at the work. Moglaff came over and said with a smile, "What's wrong? Why the long face!" Old Lü said, "Oh, it's driving people crazy! This broken grinder always breaks down, it really gives me a headache." Moglaff looked down at the mud grinding machine, looking at it from left to right, and said after a long time, "It breaks down so often, why don't you try to改造 it?" Old Lü said, "Who says we haven't! But we can't think of a way right now, why don't you help us study it together!" Moglaff said very modestly, "Let's all study it together, I may not be able to改造 it." After a while, he drew a sketch on paper, and Old Lü made it according to his drawing in two days. After testing it, it was particularly light and easy to use.

　　From then on, when Comrade Moglaff went to the site, everyone greeted him warmly. When the workers had difficulties they couldn't solve, they were all used to asking him to solve them. He has become a good friend to all of our workers.

　　我们的好朋友莫格拉夫
    鞍钢炼铁厂  薛思勤
    去年受聘来炼铁厂的苏联专家莫格拉夫，在他刚来的时候，我们工友们见着他都很陌生。自从他在大会上讲过一次话以后，工友们对他熟识起来了。以后，他再走到现场时，大家都来和他谈话或是研究技术，真是一说起来就没完。
    去年九月中旬，开风车的老刘头正在风车房子“吼吼”的开风车子，苏联专家莫格拉夫推门进来了。老刘头抬头一看是老大哥，就笑着向他点了点头，手指着一个木头椅子让他坐下。他也就笑着点了点头坐在椅子上，用他那半通不通的中国话说：“喂！刘，你这几天那去了？没有在这干。”老刘头笑着逗他说：“我也没看见你呀！我到南厂去干了十天。”“嗯！你干这个几年啦？”“哈！足够二十八年啦！”他又说：“你懂得压力和温度吗？”老刘头红着脸摇了摇头说：“一点不通！”莫格拉夫问他说：“怎不学习呢？”老刘头哭丧着脸说：“学习？在我学的时候，净是日本鬼子，谁还让你学习呀？”接着，又笑呵呵的向莫格拉夫说：“没别的，你告诉告诉我吧！”莫格拉夫点了点头，就给他讲起来，两遍、三遍，到底把老刘头教会了。这个事情传到了每个作坊，使每个工友更深刻的认识了苏联同志对咱们的帮助。从此以后，更常见着莫格拉夫工程师和工友们一块儿低着头研究技术了。
    十月，钳工老吕做高炉用的碾泥机——这是一个配合炼铁炉生产很重要的一个机器。以前经常好坏，三天一修理，四天一收拾，修理一回耽误生产很厉害，而且修理一回就把大家累的不像样，所以一提起修理它来，谁都不乐意。这次老吕把活卸下来以后运到了现场，看着活真是有点发愁，莫格拉夫走来，笑呵呵的向老吕说：“什么？愁眉不展的！”老吕说：“得啦！把人都愁坏啦！这个破碾子，老坏，真叫人脑袋都疼。”莫格拉夫低下头看着这个碾泥机，左右的看，看了好久说：“它好坏，你们不会改造一下子吗？”老吕说：“谁说不是呀！可是我们现在想不出办法来，你帮我们一起研究吧！”他很谦虚的说：“我们大家来研究，我也不一定能把他改造好。”过了一会儿，他就在纸上给画了一张草图，老吕照着他的图纸两天内做成了，一试验，特别轻巧好使。
    从这以后，当莫格拉夫同志走到现场时，大家都亲热的向他打招呼，工友们有什么难事解决不了的，都很习惯的找他来解决。他已经成了我们全体工友的一个好朋友。
