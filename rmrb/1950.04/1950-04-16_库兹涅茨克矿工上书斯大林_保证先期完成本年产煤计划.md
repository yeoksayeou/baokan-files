　　Kuznetsk Miners Write to Stalin, Guaranteeing Early Completion of This Year's Coal Production Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th] TASS, Moscow: Soviet newspapers published on the 13th a letter from Kuznetsk coal mine miners to Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The miners assured Stalin that they would call on the miners of Stalin Oblast to engage in socialist competition, and undertake specific obligations in completing this year's coal production plan ahead of schedule, and in realizing plans for the construction of industrial buildings and cultural development. They also pledged to reduce production costs and increase labor productivity.
    The Pravda published an editorial on this, stating: The letter from the Kuznetsk miners reflects the working efforts of the Soviet people to strive to complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people, supporting this initiative, will expand the scale of socialist competition even more grandly, and will win new victories.
    The Labor Daily published an editorial, urging trade union organizations to lead the mass socialist competition in an effective Bolshevik manner.
