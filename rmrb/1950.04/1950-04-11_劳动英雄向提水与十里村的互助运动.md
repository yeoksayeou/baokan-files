　　Labor Hero Xiang Tishui and the Mutual Aid Movement in Shili Village

　　Shili Village Has Six Years of Mutual Aid History
　　Shili Village in Huguan County, Changzhi District, Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party Branch Secretary and labor hero Comrade Xiang Tishui, has become a model production village in the entire county. The village's "get organized" movement began in 1943 and has been going on for six years now. During this period, due to continuous improvement and development, it has never collapsed. The main reason for this is that Comrade Xiang Tishui and the village cadres are good at leading, specifically understanding the needs of the masses, and solving problems in a timely manner, so that the masses recognize the benefits of mutual aid from practical interests. In 1943, a small number of people began to engage in mutual aid, and Xiang Tishui personally led a mutual aid group to create experience, set an example, and promote the entire village to get organized. By 1947, those who were organized accounted for more than 80% of the total number of households in the village.
　　At the beginning, they did not understand the mutual aid policy and had no experience. Only a few male laborers exchanged work during the busy farming season. However, when agricultural work was particularly urgent (such as spring plowing, sowing, harvesting, etc.), male laborers were not enough, so they developed to organize women to participate in production. In 1944, Xiang Tishui organized women and children to participate in mutual aid, changing from simple male mutual aid to whole family mutual aid. Because the strength of labor was uneven, disputes arose over the amount of work done and the quality of technology. Xiang Tishui then led everyone to study and discuss, democratically stipulating that the strength of labor would be scored, work would be counted according to the amount of work done, work would be calculated fairly regardless of difficulty, work points would be evaluated in the fields, accounts would be recorded at home, and a mutual aid system of "checking accounts every five days, settling accounts every half month, and clearing work points every season" would be democratically formulated. Because errors often occurred in the implementation, Xiang Tishui and the masses researched and developed the use of work tickets and a reward system. This not only reduced errors, but also was flexible and convenient, reducing the trouble of bookkeeping. In 1945, war support was heavy, and Shili Village contributed 3,600 labor days to war support. Under the conditions of heavy tasks and lack of labor, a contradiction was formed between production and support for the front line. At this time, Xiang Tishui led everyone to organize and implement village-wide large-scale labor exchange, which solved this problem and was very popular among the masses. During the autumn harvest that year, all the male laborers in the village went out to support the battle to liberate Huguan and Changzhi, which lasted for a long time, but the autumn harvest was successfully completed without any losses. Later, the "three combinations" (agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support unified work points) were used, and dividends were distributed according to the remaining labor force, which promoted the mutual development of agriculture and sideline occupations and achieved many results. However, in the process of mutual aid, the mistake of formalism was made, forcing the masses to completely combine all walks of life, violating the principle of mutual aid (voluntary, mutual benefit), which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. After "squeezing out feudalism" in July of the same year, the mutual aid group had a purely "poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint," which attacked the middle peasants, making the masses suspicious and unable to figure out the direction of mutual aid. In 1948, the correction of formalism began. In response to these errors, the cadres made self-criticisms in front of the masses, criticized this coercive command, the tendency to mutual aid in everything and at all times, promoted democracy, and developed voluntary and mutually beneficial mutual aid groups based on the opinions of the masses. In this way, although it was not as vigorous as before on the surface, a lot of work was actually done. Last year, in addition to carrying out mutual aid production during the busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn plowing, general life was either done by oneself if one could, or flexibly carried out by combining small mutual aid of three or five people if one could not. This is neither laissez-faire nor formalism. Now the mutual aid organization in the village is becoming more and more consolidated, and the masses reflect that "mutual aid is mutually beneficial, no one suffers losses, and everyone benefits from getting organized."
　　Overcoming Labor Difficulties, Yield Increased by More Than Five Dou Per Mu
　　After six years of mutual aid production, Shili Village has improved its technology, expanded its cultivated area (reclaiming 120 mu of wasteland), and increased grain production in agriculture. The village has 15 qing of land, and the yield per mu has increased by 5 dou and 1.7 sheng compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. The average increase per household is 5 shi and 5 dou and 6.8 sheng, and the total increase in the village is 779 shi and 5 dou. In terms of cultivation, before the war, 12% of the land was plowed three times, and 5.7% was hoeed three times; after getting organized, 19.56% of the land was plowed three times, and 34.5% was hoeed three times. In terms of fertilization, before the war, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu was 62 dan; after getting organized, the average amount per mu was 80 dan. In these years of production, although the labor force was far less than before the Anti-Japanese War, and there was a lot of war support before last year, due to the elimination of feudalism and getting organized, the output actually exceeded the pre-war level, and sideline occupations and handicrafts were developed. More than 150 women in the village have learned to spin cotton, and 23 people have learned to weave cloth. They can produce 1,300 jin of native cloth every year, which basically solves their own clothing difficulties. The men have also organized cooperative workshops, transportation and sales, and other sideline production. In 1946 alone, statistics showed that they earned 361 shi and 9 dou of millet. The number of livestock has increased from 90 heads before mutual aid to 163 heads, and the number of sheep has increased from 120 to more than 400. As a result of organizing production, the painful life of "bran and vegetables for half a year" that Shili Village had for thousands of years has been changed into a wealthy life of food and clothing.
　　New Plan · New Direction
　　In order to further improve the mutual aid organization and carry out the large-scale production movement, Shili Village has reorganized its old mutual aid organization this year. Comrade Xiang Tishui, according to the opinions of the masses, led the branch to study and improve the method of reorganizing mutual aid. They first overcame the formalism of only using large meetings and forcing the masses to make self-criticisms in the past, and held meetings of activists in production and other symposiums. The cadres and party members started by reviewing the administrative command style of leadership in the past and conducted mutual aid policy education for the masses. Let the masses understand the spirit of mutual aid, distinguish the achievements and shortcomings of mutual aid in the past, and turn the reorganization of mutual aid into a conscious and voluntary action of the masses. As a result, the masses formed a mutual aid wave of finding objects and combining freely. Out of the 90 households in the village, 15 groups have voluntarily combined, accounting for 64.3% of the total number of households in the village. The rest are still considering their respective mutual aid objects, and the cadres are still inspiring and guiding them. Therefore, this reorganization is not like the past, only superficially tense and enthusiastic for a while, but is carried out on the basis of raising the masses' mutual aid awareness, so that the masses know that without organizing production, they cannot become rich. At the same time, it is not necessary to be completely organized to carry out production. We must reorganize and produce at the same time, so that the reorganization of mutual aid and the conduct of production are closely combined.
　　Because most of the masses have organized in harmony, they demand to carry out production in an organized, led, and planned manner. Therefore, Xiang Tishui and all the party members initially drafted a production plan for the entire village. The village has a total of 1,729 mu of land, and plans to increase production by 86.45 shi. The main methods of increasing production are intensive cultivation, more fertilization, and universal weeding of 140 mu of wheat fields. The remaining autumn land is planned to be plowed three times and harrowed three times for 40%, and hoeed three times for 50%, with an average of 59 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In addition, it is planned to increase livestock by 23 heads, sheep by 115, pigs by 10, and chickens by 746. After this plan was formulated, it was first submitted to the village people's congress for study and approval, and then a village meeting was convened for discussion and approval, and the victory of land reform was celebrated. At the meeting, Xiang Tishui repeatedly explained the policy, emphasizing: "The Communist Party leads us to carry out land reform in order to liberate the productive forces and develop production. This year, the land reform has been completed, and the main task in the future is to become rich through production." Then the chairman of the people's congress announced the production plan for the entire village, and the masses discussed in groups and unanimously proposed: "Always follow the Communist Party! Land reform has turned us over, and production will lead us to prosperity."
　　Shili Village is now actively carrying out all the production work of spring plowing and sowing, and 130,000 dan of manure has been sent to the fields. At the same time, in practical actions, attention is paid to overcoming formalism, and the labor force is appropriately allocated according to the amount of life. Xiang Tishui's group has a lot of fertilizer, so it needs to use more laborers to carry it. Generally, carrying bank soil and straightening bank edges is carried out by one or two people.

　　劳动英雄向提水与十里村的互助运动
    本报通讯员  王良玉
    十里村有了六年互助历史
    山西省长治专区壶关县十里村，在中共支部书记、劳动英雄向提水同志的领导下，成了全县的生产模范村。该村的“组织起来”运动，从一九四三年开始，到现在已有六年历史。其间由于不断的改进和发展，一直没有垮过台。这主要原因，是向提水同志和村干部们善于领导，具体了解群众要求，及时解决问题，使群众从实际利益中认识到互助的好处。一九四三年有少数人开始起来互助，向提水就亲自领导了一个互助小组，创造经验，典型示范，推动全村组织起来。到一九四七年，组织起来的即占全村户数百分之八十以上。
    他们在开始时不了解互助政策，也没经验，只是几个男劳力在农忙时进行拨工。但农事特别紧迫时（如春耕、下种、收割等），男劳力已不够用，才发展到组织妇女参加生产。一九四四年，向提水组织妇女儿童参加互助，由单纯的男人互助改进到全家全力互助。由于劳力强弱不等，在做活多少、技术好坏上曾发生了争执。向提水便领导大家研究讨论，民主规定，以劳力强弱评分，按做活多少计工，按死分活计，在地头评功评工，回家记账，并民主制定“五天一对账，半月一结算，一季一清工”的互助制度。由于在实行中时常发生差错，向提水又和群众研究出使用工票与奖励制度。这样不但减少了差错，而且灵活简便，减去了记账的麻烦。一九四五年，战勤繁重，十里村共出战勤劳力工三千六百个。在任务大、劳力缺的情况下，形成了生产与支援前线的矛盾。这时，向提水就领导大家组织起来实行全村大变工，解决了这一难题，很得群众拥护。当年秋收的时候，全村全部男劳力外出支援解放壶关、长治的战役，历时很久，但秋收却并无损失地胜利完成了。后来又运用“三大结合”（农业、副业与战勤统一计工），按剩余劳力分红，推动了农副业的相互发展，取得不少成绩。但在互助过程中，曾犯了形式主义的毛病，逼着群众把各行各业完全实行结合，违犯了互助的原则（自愿、互利），惹起群众不满。同年七月“挤封建”后，互助组曾有单纯的“贫雇观点”，打击了中农，使群众怀疑，摸不清互助方向。一九四八年，开始纠正形式主义。针对这些错误，干部在群众面前作了检讨，批判了这种强迫命令，事事互助，时时互助的偏向，发扬了民主，并根据群众意见，发展自愿两利的互助组。这样，表面上虽不如以前轰轰烈烈了，但实际上做的活却不少。去年除在春耕、夏耘、秋耕等农忙季节进行了互助生产外，一般的生活都是自己能干就由自己干，自己干不了就结合三五人的小型互助灵活进行。这样既不自流，也不形式主义。现在该村的互助组织日趋巩固，群众反映是“互助互利，互不吃亏，组织起来大家沾光”。
    克服劳力困难每亩增产五斗多
    十里村经过六年的互助生产，在农业上，提高了技术，扩大了耕地面积（开荒一百二十亩），增加了粮食产量。全村土地十五顷，每亩比抗战以前增产五斗一升七，每家平均增产五石五斗六升八，全村共增产七百七十九石五。在耕作上，战前耕三遍的占百分之十二，锄三遍的占百分之五点七；组织起来以后，耕三遍的占百分之十九点五六，锄三遍的占百分之三十四点五。在施肥上，战前每亩地平均施肥六十二担；组织起来后每亩平均八十担。在这几年生产中，劳动力上虽远比抗战以前少，去年以前战勤又多，但由于消灭了封建，又组织了起来，因此产量反而超过了战前水平，而且发展了副业和手工业。全村有一百五十多个妇女学会纺花，二十三人学会织布，每年能产土布一千三百斤，基本上解决了自己穿衣的困难。男人们又组织了合作作坊、运销等副业生产，一九四六年一年统计，即赚小米三百六十一石九。牲口由互助前的九十头发展到一百六十三头，羊由一百二十只发展到四百余只。由于组织起来进行生产的结果，把十里村几千年来“糠菜半年粮”的痛苦生活改变成为吃穿富裕了。
    新计划·新方向
    为了更进一步地提高互助组织，开展大生产运动，十里村今年又整顿了旧的互助组织。向提水同志根据群众意见，领导支部研究改善整顿互助的方法。他们首先克服以往那种光用开大会和硬让群众检讨的形式主义，召开了生产中的积极分子会和其他座谈会，干部党员从检讨过去领导上的行政命令作风入手，对群众进行互助政策教育。让群众体会互助精神，分清以往互助中的成绩与缺点，把整顿互助变成了群众自觉自愿的行动。于是群众便形成了自找对象，自由结合的互助浪潮。全村九十户，已自愿结合起十五个小组，占全村户数的百分之六十四点三。其余的仍在考虑各自的互助对象，干部仍在启发引导。因此，这次整顿不像过去那样，只流于形式上一时的紧张热烈，而是在提高群众的互助觉悟基础上进行，使群众知道不组织起来生产，就不能致富。同时也不是一定要完全组织起来才能进行生产，要一面整顿，一面生产，使整顿互助和进行生产紧密结合进行。
    由于大部群众情投意合地组织了起来，就要求有组织有领导有计划地进行生产。于是向提水和全体党员初步拟出了全村生产计划。全村共地一、七二九亩，计划增产八六点四五石。增产方法主要是精耕细作，多增肥，一百四十亩麦田要普遍进锄。其余秋地计划十分之四耕三耙三，十分之五锄三，每亩施肥平均五十九担。此外计划增殖牲口二十三头，增羊一一五只，猪十只，鸡七四六只。这个计划订出后，首先交村人民代表会研究通过，又召集了村民大会讨论通过，并庆祝土地改革胜利。会上，向提水反复地讲明政策，强调指出：“共产党领导咱们进行土地改革，就是为了解放生产力，发展生产，今年土地改革完成了，今后主要工作就是生产致富。”随后人民代表会主席宣布了全村生产计划，群众分组讨论，一致提出：“永远跟着共产党走！土地改革翻了身，生产去发家。”
    十里村现在正在积极进行春耕下种的一切生产工作，已送到地里粪十三万担。同时在实际行动中注意了克服形式主义，按生活多少，适当的分配力量。向提水组肥多，就需要多用几个劳力去担，一般的担岸土、整岸边，就是一个两个的进行。
