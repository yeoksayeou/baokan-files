　　Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The Australian government is intensifying its conspiracy to ban the Australian Communist Party. According to a Sydney dispatch from Telepress: Australian Prime Minister Menzies declared on the 18th that legislative preparations to ban the Communist Party and prevent its members from holding positions in trade unions are "being accelerated and will be submitted before the end of the parliamentary session in June." The Australian government had previously announced that this legislation would be submitted on the 19th, but the widespread opposition of the people to the fascist legislation has prevented the government from taking early action. The great victory of the Australian Peace Congress, which closed in Melbourne today, has also forced the government to delay action. The task of the Australian progressive movement is now clear: to persist in and strengthen opposition to the government's suppression of freedom of rights, opposition to the Americanization of Australia, and opposition to plans to involve Australia in the belligerent "Pacific Pact" and in the imperialist war in Malaya.

　　Another report, according to a Canberra dispatch from United Press on the 19th, quoted an "authoritative source" as saying that the Australian government's bill to deal with the Communist Party will completely ban the Communist Party. The bill will soon be submitted to Parliament. In addition to declaring the Communist Party illegal, it will also prohibit Communists from holding positions in state organs or trade unions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: According to a Sydney dispatch from Telepress on the 17th: Legislation to ban the Australian Communist Party and "control" Australian trade unions will be submitted by the government to the Australian Federal Parliament, which will reconvene on April 19th. Prime Minister Menzies (who publicly praised Hitler and Mussolini before the war) is personally responsible for drafting this bill.

　　The current Australian government, which is doing its utmost to lean on American imperialism, has been looking for excuses since it came to power on December 18th last year to declare the Communist Party, which has consistently fought for the interests of the Australian people and peace, illegal. As early as the beginning of this year, United Press had revealed that the Menzies government had drafted a bill at a special cabinet meeting "stipulating that the Communist Party is illegal and stipulating that Communists be expelled from trade union offices." On January 18th, Foreign Minister Spender (who is a director of the American Goodyear Tire Company) publicly announced at a press conference: The Australian government is "prepared to declare the Communist Party illegal and seize their property" (United Press). On February 22nd, Governor-General McKell publicly announced on behalf of the government at the first meeting of Parliament that the government "is planning" a bill to declare the Communist Party illegal (Associated Press). According to a report in the Australian Sunday Sun on March 18th: The so-called "Subversive Activities Bill," which aims to "eliminate Communists and communist forces in the country," mainly includes three contents: First, declare the Communist Party illegal; second, close the Communist Party headquarters and prohibit the Communist Party from publishing newspapers and other publications; third, ban progressive mass organizations.

　　The Menzies government announced on March 23rd the implementation of the so-called "Criminal Law" as a preparatory step for declaring the Communist Party and progressive organizations illegal. According to this law, the government holds broad fascist powers and can arbitrarily prohibit assemblies and strikes under the guise of "treason," "sabotage," and "resistance to administrative and judicial organs," and can arrest, imprison, exile, and even execute people who strive for democracy, freedom, and bread. Not only that, but the Menzies government is also preparing to take measures to lead the country to the path of militarization. According to McKell's announcement in Parliament on February 22nd: "The government is now planning to strengthen the Royal Australian Navy, develop the Air Force, establish a national air force, restore women's auxiliary teams, and implement universal military training in the next three years." Obviously, these measures are entirely in the interest of American imperialism's intention to turn Australia into its military base.

　　However, all these anti-communist and anti-people arrangements of the Menzies government have been met with a powerful counterattack from the working class and communists. On January 22nd, Australian Communist Party Chairman Dixon solemnly declared at a mass meeting of 5,000 people in Sydney: "The Australian labor movement will form a united front to resist the government's attack on trade union rights and the legitimate existence of the Communist Party." Workers have also responded to the government's various intimidations by electing communists and progressives to leadership positions in trade unions. Workers have also expressed their contempt for fascist laws through action. After the "Criminal Law" was announced, dockworkers, coal miners, and tram workers still decided to continue their strikes to fight for living and democratic rights. These courageous actions of the workers forced Menzies to cancel the penalties for three dockworker leaders and broadcast a statement that "the government is not eager to continue to use the Criminal Law."

　　澳政府阴谋取缔澳共
    工人阶级已予以有力反击
    【新华社二十日讯】澳大利亚政府正变本加厉地进行取缔澳大利亚共产党的阴谋。据电通社悉尼电称：澳大利亚总理孟席斯十八日宣称：取缔共产党和不准其在工会中任职的立法准备工作，“正在加速进行，并将在六月间国会会议结束前提出”。澳政府前曾宣布此项立法将于十九日提出，但广大人民对法西斯立法的反对，已阻止政府早日采取行动。今日在墨尔本闭幕的澳大利亚和平大会的伟大胜利，也迫使政府延缓行动。目前澳大利亚进步运动的任务已经很明显，即坚持和加强反对政府的压制自由权利，反对使澳大利亚的美国化及使澳大利亚卷入好战的“太平洋公约”和卷入马来亚帝国主义战争的计划。
    另据合众社堪培拉十九日电引某“权威人士”谈称：澳政府对付共产党的法案，将彻底取缔共产党。法案不久即将提交国会，其中除宣布共产党为非法外，并将禁止共产党人在国家机关或工会中担任职务。
    【新华社十八日讯】据电通社悉尼十七日讯：取缔澳大利亚共产党和“管制”澳大利亚工会的立法，将由政府提交于四月十九日再度开会的澳大利亚联邦议会。总理孟席斯（他在战前曾公开赞扬过希特勒和墨索里尼）亲自负责起草这一法案。
    极力投靠美国帝国主义者的澳大利亚现政府，自从去年十二月十八日上台以来，就一直在寻找借口，图谋宣布一贯为澳大利亚人民及和平利益而斗争的共产党为非法。早在今年年初，合众社就曾透露，孟席斯政府已在内阁特别会议上拟订了法案，“规定共产党为非法及规定将共产党人逐出工会办公室”。一月十八日，外长斯宾德（他是美国固特异轮船公司的董事）又在记者招待会上公开宣布：澳政府“准备宣布共产党为非法，并占有他们的财产”（合众社）。二月二十二日，总督麦基尔代表政府在国会首次会议上公开宣布：政府“正在计划”宣布共产党为非法的法案（美联社）。据澳大利亚星期太阳报三月十八日报道：这个“以扫除国内的共产党人和共产主义势力”为目的的所谓“颠覆活动法案”，主要内容有三：一、宣布共产党为非法；二、封闭共产党总部，禁止共产党发行报纸和其他刊物；三、取缔进步的群众团体。
    孟席斯政府曾于三月二十三日宣布实施所谓“刑事法”，作为宣布共产党及进步团体为非法的预备步骤。按照该法，政府握有广泛的法西斯权力，可以任意以“谋叛”、“怠工”、“反抗行政及司法机关”等罪名，禁止集会和罢工，并可以逮捕、监禁、放逐以至处死争取民主、自由和面包的人民。不仅如此，孟席斯政府并准备采取措施，把国家引向军事化的道路。据麦基尔二月二十二日在国会宣布：“政府现正计划在今后三年内加强澳洲皇家海军，发展空军，建立国家空军武力，恢复妇女辅助队，实行普遍军训。”显然，这些措施完全有利于美帝国主义把澳大利亚变为它的军事基地的意旨。
    可是，孟席斯政府所有这一切反共、反人民的布置，都已遭到工人阶级及共产党人的有力反击。一月二十二日，澳共主席狄克逊曾在悉尼五千人参加的群众大会上严正宣告：“澳大利亚工人运动将组成一个统一战线，反抗政府对工会权利及共产党合法存在的进攻”。工人们也以选举共产党人及进步分子担任工会的领导职位，来回答政府的种种恫吓。工人们又以行动表示了他们对于法西斯法律的藐视。在“刑事法”宣布之后，码头工人、煤矿工人及电车工人依然决定继续争取生活及民主权利的罢工。工人们这种勇敢的行动，曾迫使孟席斯不得不取消对于三个码头工人领袖的处罚，并广播声明“政府并不急于继续运用刑事法”。
