　　Hebei Village Elections Combined with Production
　　Over 800 Villages Have Elected Village Governments
　　Democratic Movement Promotes Production and Yields Great Results
　　[From Our Newspaper] Comprehensive reports from correspondents: Hebei Province universally launched village election movements in February and March, combined with production, and directly promoted spring production. According to preliminary statistics, as of March 19, 844 villages across the province have successfully completed village elections. The village elections in Xingtai County started with production reviews, which played a significant role in promoting production. The first district of the county, through this democratic movement, identified and resolved many practical difficulties in production. For example, the masses in Dongjing'an Village lacked hemp seeds and fertilizer, so the cadres immediately used the cooperative to borrow money and buy back 10 catties of hemp seeds and 27,000 catties of bean cake. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the first district, under the combined impetus of the village election movement and production review, this spring, eleven villages planted more than 15,000 trees and 70,000 hemp plants; seven villages plowed more than 4,455 mu of spring land, accounting for more than 81% of all spring land, and weeded more than 8,000 mu of wheat land, accounting for more than 80% of all wheat land; other activities such as delivering manure, adding and repairing agricultural tools, and engaging in sideline production have all yielded great results. In the key village of Huangjiatun, after the work team arrived, they first reviewed spring production through meetings of village cadres and party members, and found that among the thirteen party members in the village, apart from two who planted trees and four who planted hemp, other party members, cadres, and the masses had serious "rest after the New Year" thoughts. Therefore, the work team, combined with production, put forward slogans such as "Spring is short, start early, and greet the democratic movement with practical actions" and "Elect good representatives and lead production well"; within the party, they called on party members to "compare production, compare leadership, and compare publicity (of democracy)" as competitive conditions for being elected as representatives. Furthermore, the original village cadres, village representatives, and 22 party members formed six publicity groups for democratic elections and production review, publicizing the significance of the democratic movement and helping the masses formulate production plans by street and by area. Under the slogan of "never resting body or mouth," party members Gao Tianbao and Wang You took the lead in formulating personal production plans and helped 21 households formulate specific plans. In the past two days, the village has planted a total of 1,000 trees, more than 2,000 hemp plants, delivered more than 2,000 carts of manure, and plowed more than 500 mu of land. Other villages also regarded "leading production well" as the main condition for electing representatives. For example, when the voters in Maoshan Village, Mancheng County, discussed the qualifications of representatives, the first condition was: "Must actively lead everyone's production." The Tongxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an in-depth inspection and found that in a few villages in Tongxian County, elections were disconnected from production or not combined enough, and issued a circular to remind all localities to pay attention.
　　After the village elections, the elected representatives and new village cadres all expressed their determination to the masses to do a good job in production. After being elected as a representative, Han Fakui, a model producer in Liang Village, Second District, Xinle County, said: "I must lead the production of the whole village well"; Deputy Village Chiefs Shi Zhilin, Zhao Laogong, and Village Chief Zhao said: "We must transform the past 'Village chief, village chief, blocks everything; village deputy, village deputy, hides from everything' (in the past, the village chief and village deputy in the village were not responsible), into: 'Village chief and village deputy, united and helping each other, leading production and achieving prosperity through labor.'" In Maoshan Village, First District, Mancheng County, after the People's Congress elected the village government, representatives and village cadres went to each electoral district to contact the masses and solicit their opinions on future work, especially production work. Based on the opinions of the masses, they formulated a production plan for the whole village.
　　However, there are still many shortcomings in the village election work in various places. In addition to the lack of attention to combining with production by individual leaders, many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance and role of democratic elections, have a simple task-oriented view, are eager for quick results, and have adopted simple methods. For example, in Dazhangzhuang, Third District, Qingyuan, elections were conducted without dividing voter groups; in Dongwulizhuang, Tenth District, Dingxian, village elections were "completed" in three days. There are also tendencies to neglect publicity and education, relax leadership, and engage in closed-doorism, all of which urgently need to be corrected and overcome.

### 河北村选结合生产  现已有八百余村选出村政府  民主运动推动生产收获很大

　　河北村选结合生产
    现已有八百余村选出村政府     
    民主运动推动生产收获很大
    【本报讯】综合通讯员来稿报道：河北全省于二、三月间，结合生产普遍展开村选运动，并直接推动了春季生产。据初步统计，截至三月十九日止，全省已有八百四十四村胜利完成村选。邢台县的村选，从检查生产着手，对推动生产起了很大作用。该县一区通过这次民主运动，检查发现和解决了不少生产中的实际困难。如东静庵村群众缺乏大麻籽和肥料，干部即马上通过合作社，贷款买回麻籽十斤、豆饼二万七千斤。据极不完全的统计，该区十一个村，在村选运动结合检查生产推动下，今春共植树一万五千余株，种大麻子七万棵；七个村共耙春地四千四百五十五亩，占全部春地百分之八十一强，锄麦地八千余亩，占全部麦地百分之八十以上；其他送粪，添置与修补农具，搞副业生产等。收获均很大。重点村黄家屯，工作组到达后，首先通过村干部和党员等会议，检查了春季生产，发现全村十三个党员中，除二人植树，四人种大麻子外，其他党员、干部和群众，都存有严重的“歇正月”思想。于是，工作组遂结合生产，提出，“春短早动手，以实际行动来迎接民主运动”、“选举好代表，把生产领导好”等口号；在党内号召党员“比生产、比领导、比宣传（民主）”，为当选代表的竞选条件。又以原有的村干部、村代表和党员二十二人，组成六个宣传民主选举和检查生产小组，分街、分片宣传民主运动意义，和帮助群众订生产计划。在“身不歇、嘴不闲”的口号下，党员高天保、王友首先订出个人生产计划，并帮助二十一户订出了具体计划。两天来，全村共植树一千株，种大麻子二千多棵，送粪两千多车，耙地五百余亩。其他各村亦都把“领导好生产”，当作选举代表的主要条件。如满城县茂山村选民讨论代表条件时，第一条就是：“要积极领导大伙生产的。”中共通县地委深入检查工作，发现通县少数村庄选举与生产脱节或结合不够的现象，特发出通报，提起各地注意。
    村选后，当选的代表和新村干部都向群众表示决心要搞好生产。新乐县二区良村，生产模范韩发魁当选代表后说：“一定要把全村生产领导好”；副村长史支林，赵老功和赵村长说：“我们要把过去‘村长村长，见事就挡；村佐（村副）村佐，见事就躲（过去该村村长村副工作都不负责）’，变成：‘村长村副，团结互助，领导生产，劳动致富。’”满城县一区茂山村，人民代表会选出村政府后，代表、村干部即分头到各选举区联系群众，征求群众对今后工作、特别是生产工作的意见。并根据群众意见，制订了全村生产计划。
    但在各地村选工作中尚存有不少缺点。除个别领导对结合生产注意不够外；不少干部对民主选举意义和作用认识不足，存在单纯任务观点，急于求成，采取了简单从事的办法。如清苑三区大张庄，未划选民小组就进行选举；定县十区东五里庄，三天就“完成”村选。并有忽视宣传教育、放松领导及关门主义等倾向，都亟须纠正克服。
