　　Wang Shufen's Labor Exchange Group
    Shi Fude
    Wang Shufen, a woman from Shang'an Village in the 20th District of the Beijing suburbs, was elected as a labor model for the entire district at the district's production conference held in April 1949. Wang Shufen's husband is a cadre detached from production, and the family lacks labor. She single-handedly undertakes the dual tasks of managing the household and production. She can do any kind of work, such as carrying manure, fetching water, building earth dikes, and hoeing the fields, and she is as good as a man. Since being elected as a labor model, she has become even more enthusiastic about production. In the first half of this year's Qingming Festival, she and her younger sister-in-law delivered more than 100 loads of manure to the fields. The dikes for the eleven mu of paddy fields have also been completed. The district production work team arrived in Shang'an Village and arranged this year's production work, calling on everyone to organize labor exchange and mutual aid groups based on the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, in order to complete the task of increasing production by 10% this year. Wang Shufen was the first to respond to the call and formed a labor exchange and mutual aid group with four women from the same village: Zhang Shufen, Zhang Yuxuan, and Wang Zhangshi. Wang Shufen was elected as the production team leader, and Zhang Shufen, who has a junior elementary school education, was appointed as the learning team leader. The two of them separately lead production and learning. The four members of this group have equal labor power, so they only determined the principle of exchanging labor based on the wages of male workers: each work unit is equivalent to 2.4 jin of millet. Calculations are done every fifteen days. Regarding learning, they decided to have a literacy class every night and study new characters during breaks during the day. In order to ensure learning, they also stipulated that there would be a test once a month.
    Since their labor exchange group was established, they hoed 18 mu of wheat fields in three days from April 7th to 9th. Now that the wheat fields have been hoed, they have begun harrowing the land and sowing seeds. The four families have a total of 25.5 mu of paddy fields and 11.5 mu of dry land. From now until the autumn plowing and sowing of wheat, they plan to use no male labor except for harvesting wheat and plowing wheat stubble.
    Under their leadership, the women of Shang'an Village are actively organizing labor exchange groups, and the women have been swept up in a production upsurge and a competition to strive for model labor exchange groups.

　　王树芬的拨工组
    史福德
    京郊第二十区上岸村妇女王树芬，在一九四九年四月召开的全区生产大会上，当选为全区的劳动模范。王树芬的丈夫是一个脱离生产的干部，家里缺少劳动力，她一人担起了理家和生产的双重任务。她什么活都能干，担粪、挑水、打土埂、锄地等，顶得上一个男子。自从被选为劳动模范后，生产更加起劲了。今年清明节前半个月，她和她的小姑两人就把一百多担粪都送到地里。十一亩水地埂也打完了。区生产工作组到了上岸村村里，布置今年的生产工作，号召大家在自愿两利、等价交换的原则下，组织拨工互助组，以完成今年增产一成的任务。王树芬第一个响应了号召，和同村张淑芬、张玉萱、王张氏等四个妇女，组成了拨工互助组。王树芬被选为生产组长，由有初小以上文化程度的张淑芬担任学习组长，两人分头领导生产和学习。这一组四个人有着相等的劳动力，因此仅根据男工的工钱定下变工的原则：每一个工合伏地小米二斤四两。十五天计算一次。关于学习，她们定出每晚上识字班；白天休息的时候学生字。为要保证学会，还规定一个月测验一次。
    她们的拨工组成立以后，从四月七日到九日三天工夫，就锄了麦地十八亩，现在麦地已锄完，开始耠地和下种。她们四家共有水地二十五亩五分、旱地十一亩五分，从现在到秋耕种麦，她们准备除掉割麦与刨麦茬外，决不用男工。
    上岸村的妇女在她们的带动下，正纷纷组织拨工组，妇女们已卷入生产热潮和争取模范拨工组的竞赛里。
