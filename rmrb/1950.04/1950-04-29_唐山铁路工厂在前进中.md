Tangshan Railway Factory Moving Forward
　　By our reporter Yao Fu
　　Tangshan Railway Factory is the third largest railway factory in the country, with over sixty years of history. It currently has 4,853 employees (about half are veteran workers), including twelve branch factories. The factory's main task is to repair locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. The factory's locomotive repair task accounts for 26.4% of the national total.

　　"Why has the New Record Movement unfolded so rapidly, deeply, and universally in the railway factory?" According to the factory's responsible comrade, "This is the result of diligently absorbing advanced experiences from the Northeast and closely combining them with the wisdom of all employees in the factory." In February of this year, the factory's employees widely studied the experiences of the New Record Movement in the Northeast, gradually resolving some veteran workers' concerns that they might not keep up when piece-rate wages were implemented, and the ideological concerns of young workers fearing their masters would be too busy creating new records to teach them techniques. They broke down some conservative ideas that "machines cannot be transformed." In particular, Zhao Guoyou's article, "How I Created New Records," further encouraged the confidence of the workers, and "Everyone learns from Zhao Guoyou" became the slogan of all the workers. At this time, the factory carried out a series of preparatory works: formally established a democratic management committee; each site discussed standard working hours; and formulated plans and reward regulations for the New Record Movement. With mature ideological preparation and sufficient organizational preparation, new records emerged like mushrooms after a spring rain in early March.

　　After machines and technology were mastered by conscious workers, they immediately exerted their full effectiveness. The news that Wang Junru, an old worker in his fifties, created the first frame guide plate measuring device was spread throughout the factory by the band delivering the good news, and Factory Director Gong personally awarded him the banner of honor. The workers were all excited. Everyone was studying and thinking about creating new records, especially the periodic reward of advanced producers every week and every month, which more powerfully promoted the rapid development of the New Record Movement. In the course of thirty-odd days, two-fifths of the factory's employees made brilliant contributions, creating a total of 615 new records.
  (III)
　　The factory director and the four workshop directors who were workers by origin were all transferred from the advanced industrial area of Dalian last year. They brought the style of bravely accepting tasks and following the mass line.
　　At the beginning of the movement, the Party, government, and trade union leaders formed a working group, with the mechanical workshop as the leadership focus. They specifically helped the workshop implement democratic discussions and formulate preliminary standard working hours for the air valve group; and according to the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, they made detailed production plans for each group, each lathe, and each person in the workshop. Everyone's confidence was enhanced. On March 23, the mechanical workshop achieved a new record of completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding 7.3 units. The factory immediately summarized the experience of the workshop and widely distributed good news, which powerfully promoted the development of the movement. In the course of the movement, the factory director grasped the daily production situation and provided timely guidance. The freight car workshop failed to complete the task in the first half of the month. The factory director immediately went to check the reasons and found that the failure to complete the task was due to the difficulty in raw materials. He immediately mobilized the workers to collect more than 300 sets of springs for the workshop to use. As a result, the workshop overfulfilled the task by the end of the month and created the highest production record since liberation.
  (IV)
　　Rationalization proposals are an important link in promoting the New Record Movement and also a component part of the New Record Movement. At the beginning of the New Record Movement, the factory established a Rationalization Proposal Committee, and each branch factory established a Rationalization Proposal Group, led by a dedicated person from the trade union. In March, the employees put forward more than 90 proposals of various kinds, and more than 50 of them have been adopted. Zhou Guangfa, director of the foundry workshop, tried casting malleable iron (Ma Tie) instead of cast copper, which can save three tons of copper per month. Lu Guidan, a painter in the passenger car workshop, suggested using a self-made electric small grinder to crush the accumulated paint paste over the years, which can save more than 20 million yuan in RMB... In order to strengthen the leadership of the movement, the factory decided to continue to work hard in the following aspects: First, strengthen the role of the Democratic Management Committee to make it a leading body that decides the actions of the whole factory. Second, strengthen technical calibration and finished product inspection to make working hours more scientific and rational, and make finished product standardization. Third, universally establish workshop contact contracts to enable the New Record Movement to develop in a balanced way. Factory Director Gong Zhensheng said to the reporter with full confidence: "We want to adopt the Northeast production chart system. Only accurate planning is the guide for action."

　　唐山铁路工厂在前进中
    本报记者  药夫
    唐山铁路工厂是全国铁路工厂中第三大厂，已有六十多年的历史。现有职工四八五三人（老工人约占二分之一）。包括十二个分厂。该厂主要任务是修理机车、客车和货车。该厂修理机车的任务，占全国总任务的百分之二六·四。
  （一）
    “为什么铁路工厂的新纪录运动展开得如此迅速、深入和普遍呢？”据该厂负责同志告记者说：“这是由于认真吸收东北先进经验，与本厂全体职工的智慧密切结合的成果”。今年二月间，该厂职工广泛地学习了东北创造新纪录运动的经验，逐步解决了某些老工友怕实行计件工资时，自己跟不上；青工们怕师父忙着创造新纪录，自己学不上技术的思想顾虑。打破了某些认为“机器是不能改造的”保守思想。特别是赵国有《我是怎样创造新纪录的》文章，更鼓舞了工友们的信心，“人人学习赵国有”，变成了全体工友的口号。这时，该厂即进行了一系列的准备工作：正式成立了民主管理委员会；各现场都讨论了标准工时；订立了创造新纪录运动计划和奖励条例。思想酝酿成熟，组织工作准备充分，三月初，新纪录即如雨后春笋般涌现出来。
  （二）
    机器和技术被自觉的工人掌握以后，立即发挥了充分的效能。五十多岁的老工人王俊茹创造先架导板测定器的消息，被送喜报的乐队传遍了全厂，贡厂长亲自授给他光荣旗。工友们的心情都激动起来了。人人都在为创造新纪录而钻研、思索，特别是一周一月的定期奖励先进生产者，更有力地推进了新纪录运动迅速开展。在三十来天的过程中，全厂五分之二的职工都有了光辉的贡献，共创造新纪录六百一十五件。
  （三）
    该厂厂长和四个工人出身的场主任，都是去年从先进工业区——大连调来的。他们带来了勇敢接受任务和走群众路线的作风。
    在运动开始之初，党、政、工各领导同志即组成工作组，以机械场作为领导重点。具体帮助该场实行民主讨论，订出风闸组的初步标准工时；又根据上级分配的任务，给全场每个组、每台车床及每个人都作了详尽的生产计划。每个人的信心都提高了。三月二十三日，机械厂出现提前完成任务，并超过七点三台的新纪录，厂方立即总结了该厂经验，广泛散出捷报，有力的推进了运动的发展。在运动过程中，厂长掌握了每天的生产情况，及时给以指导。货车厂前半月没有完成任务，厂长立即去检查原因，发现没有完成任务，是由于原料困难。立即发动工友搜集了三百余组弹簧供给该厂使用。结果，该厂到月底超额完成了任务，并创造了自解放以来的最高生产新纪录。
  （四）
    合理化建议是推动新纪录运动的重要一环，也是新纪录运动的一个组成部分。当新纪录运动开始之初，该厂便成立了合理化建议委员会，各分场建立合理化建议小组，由工会抽专人领导。三月份职工们提出各种建议九十余件，已被采纳五十余件。铸工场主任周广发试铸可锻铁（麻铁）代替铸铜，每月可省铜三吨。客车场油漆帮工陆桂丹建议用自制电动小磨机，磨碎积存多年的油漆膏，可节省人民币二千余万元……。为了加强对运动的领导，该厂决从下列几个方面继续努力：第一、加强民主管理委员会的作用，使之成为决定全厂行动的领导机关。第二、加强技术标定与成品检查，使工时更加科学化与合理化，使成品规格化。第三、普遍订立车间联系合同，以便使新纪录运动平衡发展。贡振声厂长满怀信心的对记者说：“我们要采用东北生产图表制，只有精确的计划才是行动的指南。”
