Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 14th -- The Tumote Banner, directly under the leadership of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, held its first People's Representatives Conference from the 5th to the 8th of this month. The vast majority of the banner's population are Mongolian. The representatives attending included farmers, workers, women, youth, lamas, democratic figures, merchants, and representatives from various banner-affiliated agencies, and from city and county people's governments within the banner's borders, totaling seventy-eight people. The conference mainly discussed issues such as spring plowing and animal husbandry production. Before the meeting, most representatives had many concerns about production and difficulties in spring plowing, and had ideas about relying on the government to solve problems. Among the thirty-nine proposals that were summarized, most requested loans and grain from the People's Government, and asked for permission to continue planting opium poppies. At the meeting, representatives of the People's Government gave detailed explanations of the government's policies regarding rewarding production, protecting the fruits of labor, reasonable burdens, and agricultural loans, and devoted two-thirds of the entire meeting time to repeated discussions in plenary sessions and small groups, addressing the representatives' ideological situations, thereby eliminating concerns and dependency. For example, Mongolian representative Bu Hehongshou said: "The villagers came to the meeting and talked a lot about difficulties, asking for loans of money and grain. Now I know that the government is our own. In fact, the difficulties in our village can be solved by helping each other." Many representatives stated that they must return and explain the various policies of the People's Government to everyone, and specifically lead everyone in production; they guaranteed that all opium poppies planted last autumn and recently planted would be eradicated and replaced with crops. The Mongolian representatives also mentioned organizing labor exchange and mutual assistance with Han compatriots to strengthen the unity of the Mongolian and Han people. The lama representatives also stated that they would mobilize lamas to participate in labor production when they returned. The conference finally unanimously adopted the banner's 1950 agricultural and animal husbandry production plan and resolutions on banning opium and narcotics. At the closing of the conference, Kui Bi (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, attended the meeting and addressed all the representatives. He used the achievements of economic, cultural, and other construction aspects of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in recent years to illustrate the bright future of ethnic minorities under the leadership of the Communist Party, giving the representatives a great encouragement.

　　绥远省土默特旗
    举行各界人民代表会议
    通过今年农业畜牧生产计划和禁烟禁毒决议
    【新华社归绥十四日电】直属绥远省人民政府领导的土默特旗，已于本月五日至八日举行首届各界人民代表会议。该旗绝大多数为蒙民。出席代表包括农民、工人、妇女、青年、喇嘛、民主人士、商人和旗属各机关、旗境各市、县人民政府代表共七十八人。会议主要讨论了进行春耕和畜牧生产等问题。会前，多数代表对于进行生产、春耕中的困难，存在着不少顾虑和依靠政府解决的思想。在归纳的三十九件提案中，大部分是要求人民政府贷款、贷粮，并请求允许继续播种大烟。会上，人民政府代表详尽地讲解了政府关于奖励生产、保护劳动所得。合理负担及农业贷款等政策，并以全部会议中三分之二的时间，针对代表们的思想情况，进行了大会和小组的反复讨论，因而消除了代表中的顾虑和依赖的思想。如蒙民代表之布和鸿寿说：“村里人叫来会上多说困难，要求贷给款粮。现在才知道政府是自己的。其实我们村里的困难是可以互相帮助解决的。”许多代表都表示：回去一定要很好向大家说明人民政府的各种政策，并具体领导大家生产；对去秋种上的和刚种的大烟，保证一律铲除，改种农作物。蒙民代表并提到要和汉胞组织变工互助，加强蒙汉人民的团结。喇嘛代表也表示回去要动员喇嘛参加劳动生产。会议最后一致通过一九五○年全旗农业、畜牧生产计划和禁烟禁毒的决议。大会闭幕时，绥远省人民政府奎壁（蒙族）副主席到会向全体代表讲话。他以内蒙自治区几年来经济、文化等各方面的建设成绩，说明在共产党领导下少数民族的光明前途，给到会代表以极大的鼓舞。
