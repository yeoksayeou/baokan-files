Xinhua News Agency, 15th:

　　Report on the Work of Suiyuan Province by Dong Qiwu, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government (presented at the 28th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administrative Council on April 14, 1950), the full text is as follows:

　　Suiyuan covers an area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers, with a population of only 2,360,000. The average annual rainfall is 336 millimeters, generally a relatively arid region. However, the Yellow River flows through western and central Suiyuan, creating a natural irrigation area. Therefore, except for some desert areas in the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League, most are suitable for both agriculture and animal husbandry. In terms of agricultural production, the counties in eastern, central, and western Suiyuan have always been regions capable of exporting grain to neighboring provinces. In particular, the Houtao area in western Suiyuan has fertile plains with over 1,700 kilometers of main and branch canals that can utilize Yellow River water for irrigation. There are over 15 million mu of arable land, with only about 3 million mu cultivated annually. According to surveys and designs by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, an additional 10 million mu of paddy fields can be expanded in the short term. The land in Houtao is flat and has not undergone fine divisions, making it ideal for mechanized farming. The crop growing season is 165 days annually. Except for cotton production, which is more difficult to develop, other crops have shown success in trials and promotion. All of this demonstrates that Suiyuan, due to the long-term rule of feudal bureaucratic bourgeoisie, was a relatively backward region in the past, but it has very favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production in the future. This is the first characteristic of Suiyuan.

　　Regarding industry and mining: According to existing surveys, Suiyuan has approximately 480 million tons of coal (possible reserves of 600 million tons), 40 million tons of iron, 50,000 tons of asbestos, 300,000 tons of mica, and an annual output of 150,000 tons of graphite, 150,000 tons of natural soda, and 3 million jin of salt. There are also more than ten other rare metals such as tungsten. Not only are the resources abundant, but the distribution of these mining areas is close to railway transportation, which provides considerable convenience for exploitation. The leather, wool weaving, papermaking, and flour milling industries, although currently having a very weak foundation, all have the potential for development in the future due to abundant raw materials. This is the second characteristic of Suiyuan.

　　The third characteristic: Suiyuan is a region where multiple ethnic groups reside. Out of the province's population of 2.3 million, Mongolians account for about 200,000, and there are also some Hui people in Gui Sui, Baotou, and Fengzhen. Currently, the administrative divisions of Suiyuan, in addition to the four special districts, include the Yikezhao League, Ulanqab League, Tumet Banner, and the four banners of eastern Suiyuan (Zheng Hong, Zheng Huang, Xiang Huang, Xiang Lan), which are all regions where Mongolians live in concentrated or mixed Mongolian-Han communities.

　　In addition, Suiyuan is a region that was peacefully liberated through uprising, which makes our work different from that of other provinces in some respects. Since the peaceful liberation of Beijing last year, Suiyuan has been brewing peace, but at that time, the opinions of cadres were still very divided. Later, Yan Xishan, in a last-ditch effort, became the puppet executive president, thinking that he had some historical relationship with the Suiyuan army. He vainly attempted to win over the Suiyuan troops as his political capital in the puppet government to help Chiang Kai-shek's death throes, and dispatched special agents to carry out division, bribery, and sabotage, further increasing the difficulty of the uprising. However, due to the victorious development of the Liberation War on a national scale, the greatness of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the efforts of Mr. Fu Zuoyi and cadres at all levels, the peaceful liberation was finally completed. For the past six months, we have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions to carry out various tasks of "uniting as one to strive for progress, reforming the old system, implementing new policies, and striving to build a new Suiyuan for the people."

　　Now I will briefly report on the progress of the specific tasks as follows:

　　First, regarding the transformation of political power:

　　Since the Suiyuan uprising, cadres in eastern and western Suiyuan have separately conducted in-depth studies of Chairman Mao's instructions and the CPPCC documents to prepare ideologically. Western Suiyuan also made preparations for merging and reorganizing the army, reducing designations, abolishing the political work system, and detaining special agents. At the same time, eastern Suiyuan also sent liaison personnel to first achieve unified management of railways, banks, and highways. On December 2, the Fourth Committee of the Central People's Government approved the list of chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government. On December 13, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission appointed the responsible personnel of the Suiyuan Military Region. On December 27, the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee was formally established in Gui Sui. On January 1 of this year, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government and the Suiyuan Military Region were established simultaneously. In the past three months, a series of tasks have been carried out.

　　1. Adjusting administrative divisions: Gui Sui and Baotou were designated as cities under provincial jurisdiction. The original Shaanba City was designated as a town directly under the Shaanba Special District due to insufficient economic, cultural, and transportation conditions. The Ulanqab League, with the exception of the abolition of the Bailingmiao Office, still governs six banners: Siziwang Banner, Darhan Banner, Maomingan Banner, Donggong Banner, Xigong Banner, and Zhonggong Banner. The Yikezhao League originally governed seven banners: Zhasake Banner, Dalate Banner, Hangjin Banner, Etok Banner, Junwang Banner, Jungar Banner, and Uxin Banner. In addition to abolishing the Dalate Banner Public Training Office, Taolimin Office, and Hangjin Banner Deputy Battalion Office, Dongsheng County was also placed under the leadership of the League. The Eastern Suiyuan Four Banners Office was abolished. Zheng Hong Banner was made the central banner, and the remaining Zheng Huang, Xiang Huang, and Xiang Lan Banners were organized according to the Class A district system, under the leadership of the central banner. In order to take care of the historical and existing special circumstances of the Tumet Banner, the administrative facilities temporarily maintained the status quo, using the method of separate Mongolian and Han governance, with the coexistence of banner and county. The Tumet Banner People's Government was established, directly under the leadership of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and the Hedong Zhantai area was also placed under the leadership of the Tumet Banner People's Government. The remaining 22 counties, with the exception of Dongsheng, which was placed under the leadership of the Yimeng Autonomous Region People's Government, were divided into four special commissioner districts. The Jining Special District governs six counties: Jining, Fengzhen, Xinghe, Taolin, Longsheng, and Wudong. The Helin Special District governs four counties: Helin, Qingshuihe, Tuoketuo, and Liangcheng. The Baotou Special District governs five counties: Baotou, Wuchuan, Guyang, Gui Sui, and Salazi. The Shaanba Special District governs six counties: Wuyuan, Langshan, Yanjiang, Anbei, Micang, and Linhe, as well as Shaanba Town.

　　2. Formulating the 1950 policy guidelines: In view of the specific situation in Suiyuan, the following eight policy guidelines were formulated for Suiyuan: (1) Suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents to stabilize social order. (2) Establishing and strengthening the people's democratic united front. (3) Adapting to the urgent needs of the current farmers, restoring and developing agricultural production, implementing the "two-five rent reduction," and preparing the foundation for land reform. (4) Mobilizing and organizing mass organizations such as workers, farmers, youth, and women, and making them powerful and reliable pillars for various constructions. (5) Economic construction: Following the policy of "both public and private, both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges" in the Common Program, to achieve the goal of "developing production and prospering the economy." The current specific policy is to first restore and develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, and gradually restore industry and mining, in order to promote the social and economic development of Suiyuan. (6) Consolidating finance, consolidating taxation, increasing income, streamlining and saving, to achieve the goal of developing production and ensuring supply. (7) Implementing new democratic scientific and cultural education, while paying attention to supporting the culture of ethnic minorities and developing education in various leagues and banners. (8) Resolutely implementing the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, opposing great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, preventing all discrimination, oppression, and acts that divide ethnic unity, consolidating Mongolian, Han, and Hui unity, implementing regional autonomy for ethnic minorities, and developing the political, economic, cultural, and educational construction of Mongolians and Huis. Governments at all levels in Mongolian banners should implement democratic reforms, establish people's representative conferences at all levels, reorganize Mongolian armed forces, establish new military and political systems, and plan to appropriately resolve disputes that existed between Mongolians and Hans in the past, such as land, pasture, and ferry disputes.

　　3. Transformation of political power: The transformation of political power includes several steps: First, merging provincial government agencies and resettling the original cadres in western Suiyuan. This work has now been initially completed. At the beginning of the merger, due to the different ideological systems in the past, some cadres in western Suiyuan inevitably harbored some doubts. However, after personnel consultations and adjustments, everyone was given the opportunity to work or study. In terms of the proportion of personnel assigned, eastern Suiyuan accounted for 43.5% and western Suiyuan accounted for 56.5% at the section chief level, which fully proved that a solid foundation for unity was created. Second, the result of the merger not only requires formal unity, but mainly requires achieving unity in the system, consistency in ideological understanding, and consistency in work style in all aspects. Therefore, leading the study became an important task. Since the successive establishment of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and the Suiyuan Military Region, the Suiyuan Military and Political Cadre Study Group was formally established, and the original Suiyuan Provincial Administrative Cadre School carried out the division of labor and cadre education. At the same time, the Military and Political Committee specially strengthened the study of incumbent cadres, formulated plans, unified leadership, and established the General Committee for Learning, and branches of the Committee for Learning in various organs and troops. Insisting on two hours of study every day, the achievements in the past three months, in terms of the study group, the first batch of participants included 1,271 incumbent cadres, 1,463 unemployed cadres, a total of 2,934 people. It was originally scheduled for incumbent cadres to study for one and a half months, and unemployed cadres to study for three months. From February 1, after two months of study, 1,514 people graduated for work needs, and the remaining 1,220 people stayed in the group to continue studying. In terms of the administrative cadre school, incumbent cadres were transferred and trained twice. The first time was 140 provincial-level cadres and 500 city and county cadres, and the second time was 100 provincial-level cadres and 250 city and county cadres, totaling 990 people. In terms of the study situation of incumbent cadres, four study units have been held, all with plans, arrangements, tests, and summaries. In the process of learning, due to the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions by senior responsible cadres such as comrades Gao Kelin, Yao Zhe, and Yang Zhilin, and Communist Party members and other veteran cadres, the result of "resolutely uniting, patiently educating and transforming" was also due to the awareness and determination of the cadres in western Suiyuan to transform themselves. The general learning situation has achieved very good results. Third, in terms of democratic governance and the transformation of basic-level political power, the 1950 policy guidelines stipulated the reorganization of cities and counties and the convening of people's representative conferences at all levels. In accordance with democratic principles, the political power at all levels should be transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the Baojia system should be abolished. It is also stipulated that cities with more than 30,000 people should convene people's representative conferences within two months after the merger, and counties and banners should convene people's representative conferences within four months after the merger. In districts and villages, farmers' associations should be established, and farmers' representative conferences should first replace the work of people's representative conferences. Now, the counties in eastern Suiyuan have convened the second people's representative conference because they were liberated earlier. The cities of Gui Sui and Baotou in central Suiyuan, and counties such as Gui Sui and Helin, have convened the first people's representative conference. The counties in western Suiyuan are now being instructed by the production and construction work team to convey the Central Committee's instructions on production work, and in conjunction with production, organize the masses to establish a foundation and prepare conditions for the people's representative conferences to be convened soon, "to build Suiyuan into a truly people's liberated area."

　　Second, regarding troop reorganization:

　　Like the transformation of political power, this part of the work first carried out persuasion and education, and then convened cadres at the army, division, and brigade levels to establish a senior cadre study class to thoroughly study the nature and principles of army building of the People's Liberation Army, as well as various systems. Then, in combination with the actual situation, a reorganization plan was formulated, cadre allocation was deliberated, and ideological mobilization was carried out in various troops. Then, in accordance with the reorganization plan, political systems and other systems at all levels were established, and the troops were reorganized. At the same time, in addition to establishing a senior cadre study class, a conference of staff officers was also convened to study the staff business of the People's Liberation Army, and a conference of supply personnel was also convened to study the supply system of the People's Liberation Army. These three conferences all achieved good results, prompting us to reorganize the army into a true People's Liberation Army. In addition, cadres above the rank of battalion commander were convened to study in the study group, so that they could gain a deeper understanding. The military region headquarters plans to complete the preparations for transfer by February 10, complete the transfer of troops to various defense zones by February 20, and complete the reorganization work by mid-March. Now the troops are carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions in the production areas and engaging in production. The situation of army production will be explained in the report on production issues.

　　Third, regarding suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents and stabilizing social order:

　　The reasons for the existence and development of bandits and special agents in Suiyuan are: First, the people have been cruelly exploited by the feudal landlord class for many years, and have been burned, killed, and oppressed by the Japanese invaders for several years, forcing the people to have no way to live and to take risks and become bandits; second, under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, special agent activities were inevitable in Suiyuan. Before the "September 19" uprising, some special agents came to Suiyuan to carry out divisive work. In addition to the detained and surrendered, there may still be lurking remnants of bandits who are conspiring to engage in sabotage. Based on these circumstances, we decided that the policy of suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents is to actively mobilize and organize the broad masses, do a good job in the reorganization of the army and the transformation of political power, and earnestly implement the policy of striving for education and transformation, and closely integrate it with work such as rent reduction, democratic governance, and economic construction to strengthen political disintegration and military suppression. At the same time, we will focus on the transportation lines, the Yimeng Houtao area where bandits and special agents are active, and the junction of the two administrative regions.

　　After "September 19," more than 70 bandits and special agents were detained, and more were detained later. A total of 18 large and small radio stations were seized. In terms of suppressing bandits, except for a few gangs or scattered bandits, there are no more bandits in Suiyuan. We strive to basically eliminate the scattered bandits and lurking special agents in Suiyuan in 1950.

　　Fourth, regarding production work:

　　This year, the agricultural production in Suiyuan Province is mainly for restoration, and development is sought on the basis of restoration. The central government requires the province to produce 1.6 billion jin of miscellaneous grains, survive 1 million trees, and breed 60,000 heads of large livestock.

　　In order to complete this task, we first widely publicized the policy of "rewarding production" and "getting rich through labor," and clearly announced the policy of firmly protecting the interests of middle peasants and rational burdens to stabilize the production mood of all classes. At the same time, we vigorously helped poor farmers solve the difficult problems of production, solve the problems of cattle plows and labor, and solve the problems of rations and seeds. Concrete methods have been formulated according to the different conditions in each region. The province has a total of more than 50 million mu of arable land. Before 1937, about 30 million mu had been cultivated. Over the years, due to the war, it was reduced to about 20 million mu. Since receiving the task from the central government, after convening an agricultural production and water conservancy conference, careful calculation and allocation, it is necessary to plant more than 24.7 million mu this year to complete this year's production task.

　　In order to ensure the completion of the agricultural production plan, water conservancy is also regarded as an important task. This year, the total number of medium-sized water conservancy projects assisted by the government in helping the masses to build, such as: opening up the Chaodai Canal in Wudong Gui Sui, the three major share canals in Tongshao Langshan, building the Naobao Canal in Liangcheng, repairing the Wanjia Canal in Gui Sui, the Maidagou in Saxian, and small-scale water conservancy projects organized by the masses themselves, such as: Fengzhen, Helin, Liangcheng, Xinghe, Longsheng, Wudong, Gui Sui, Yimeng, etc., a total of 67 places, can increase the irrigation area by 978,200 mu. Large-scale water conservancy projects, such as the completion of all four first-made sluices in western Suiyuan, can increase the irrigation area by 10 million mu. The completion of the Bawanghe Minfu Canal can irrigate 220,000 mu; the completion of the flood control dike on the left bank of the Yellow River can protect 260,000 mu of cultivated land. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also plans to assist the Yellow River Conservancy Commission survey team in completing the survey and design of the large irrigation area of Houtao and Sanhuhe paddy fields. In the future, the completion of the Daheihe siltation project will greatly increase the irrigation area, and the land will be more fertile than Houtao.

　　In terms of forestry, the central government requires 1 million trees to survive this year. Seven provincial nurseries have now been restored. It is estimated that each institution and school will plant two trees per person, and the masses will plant trees in spring and autumn. The province will plant a total of 2,437,000 trees. Incentive and protection measures have been formulated, and the number of surviving trees in the future may exceed the target allocated by the central government.

　　This year, 60,000 heads of large livestock will be bred. In Suiyuan, after more than ten years of war, the number of livestock has decreased to less than 50%. Increasing the breeding of this number is an arduous task. However, we carefully calculated at the agricultural production and water conservancy conference and resolutely demanded completion. In total, this year, on the basis of existing livestock, cattle will increase by 8% (approximately 48,800 heads), horses will increase by 8% (approximately 11,000 heads), donkeys will increase by 10% (approximately 7,500 heads), sheep will increase by 20% (approximately 271,700), and goats will increase by 25% (approximately 88,900). At the same time, side occupations are promoted, and people are encouraged to raise pigs and chickens. It is estimated that one pig per five people and two chickens per person can raise about 270,000 pigs and 2,360,000 chickens. Other horticulture and fruits and vegetables will strive to be sufficient for the province this year.

　　Regarding troop production, it was decided that two-thirds of the combat troops and one-third of the organs will participate. A total of more than 58,000 people will participate in production, and about 400,000 mu of land can be planted. Calculating the average yield of 70 jin of coarse grains per mu, 28 million jin of coarse grains can be harvested. Other vegetables, pig farming, and chicken farming are used to improve meals and increase nutrition.

　　In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the provincial government recently organized a spring plowing work inspection team to go to various counties and banners to supervise and inspect. More than 180 cadres below the department head level participated. Before departure, a four-day meeting was held to explain the specific situation in various places, and the main task this time was to publicize policies, promote production, appropriately solve difficulties, and stabilize and improve the farmers' production mood to complete this year's production tasks. It was decided to send a team to each county and banner, and the work period for each team after arriving in the work area is 50 days. Due to in-depth understanding of the situation and timely resolution of problems, it can play a great role in promoting the restoration and increase of production this year.

　　Fifth, regarding taxation, public bonds, and unified financial and economic work:

　　In addition to agricultural production, afforestation, and water conservancy, only three points are reported on the province's other financial and economic work.

　　First, regarding taxation. The central government approved the province's 1950 tax revenue task as 66.8 million jin. After two tax conferences, it is expected to exceed the task. According to the total for the first quarter (January to March), the province collected 28.82 million jin, accounting for 43% of the central government's approved annual task for the province. According to this season, the task has been overfulfilled.

　　Second, is the promotion of public bonds. The central government originally allocated 400,000 shares to the province. Because the provincial government had just merged in January, and the cities and counties of Gui Sui and Baotou were also being reorganized, the publicity work was not enthusiastically carried out. It was not until early February that the promotion work was vigorously carried out. As of March 29, the People's Bank of China actually received 412,114 shares of bonds. Now the task of promoting public bonds in the province has been overfulfilled.

　　Third, is the decision on unified national financial and economic work promulgated by the central government. The province launched learning, from intensive reading of documents to raising questions, discussing questions, and then combining with practice to try to draft a streamlined and economical plan. After two weeks of heated discussions, and successively reading a series of documents promulgated by the central government, everyone warmly supported this decision and was determined to implement this decision. On April 1, the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee and the Provincial People's Government jointly organized the Compilation Committee and the Warehouse Material Inventory Committee, and actively checked food, established warehouses, and corrected the past method of decentralized storage to prepare to undertake the task assigned by the central government to allocate food.

　　Sixth, regarding ethnic policies:

　　Suiyuan is a multi-ethnic region, a region where several ethnic groups (Mongolian, Han, and Hui) live together, and there are intricate and complex relationships between the various ethnic groups. Under the reactionary system, it is impossible for the various ethnic groups to unite and love each other. This time, due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, the correct provisions of the Common Program's ethnic policies are supported by the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and with the personal leadership of Vice Chairman Ulanhu, the ethnic issues in Suiyuan that have been unresolved for many years have been successfully resolved in a preliminary way, and a "Plan for Solving the Mongolian Ethnic Issues in Suiyuan" has been jointly formulated. According to this plan, the Uyi leagues, under the unified leadership of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the Suiyuan Provincial Military Region, and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, have established the Yimeng Autonomous Region People's Government, the Yimeng Military Sub-district, the Uimeng Autonomous Region People's Government, and the Uimeng Military Sub-district, and have established People's Banks and trade organizations in various leagues to prepare for the development of the economy of various banners. Of course, the current achievements are still very small, but due to this new ethnic relationship of equality and mutual assistance, we can already see the new future of the people of Suiyuan, and we have the confidence to turn Suiyuan into a united and loving big family for all ethnic groups.

　　Seventh, a few opinions:

　　1. In the situation of insufficient food and difficult allocation across the country, we believe that if the government can extend the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway to Xishanju or Shaanba, not only can the grain production in western Suiyuan be quickly transported out, but also the Yellow River shipping from Ningxia to Suiyuan can be combined to quickly transport the grain from Ningxia. Baotou to Xishanju is completely flat, and there is no great difficulty.

　　2. The alkali in Yimeng has been investigated by personnel from the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central Government, and they are about to start mining, but the problem is still transportation. We hope to first build a highway from Baotou to Etok Banner. This is the second point.

　　3. The minerals in Suiyuan are mostly not far from the railway line. If they can be mined as soon as possible, they can increase the country's wealth. This is the third point.

　　Eighth, conclusion:

　　Summarizing the previous report, compared with other fraternal provinces, Suiyuan is a relatively backward province in production. However, due to the superior natural conditions and the vast land and sparse population, there is great potential for development in agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and mining. Although we have a broken bowl in our hands, there is gold buried underground. Secondly, compared with other fraternal provinces, Suiyuan was liberated later, and everything is one step behind. However, every one of our cadres is eager to learn from Chairman Mao, to learn from the Communist Party, and to learn from fraternal provinces, to meet the great task of production and governance, and to complete this task and exceed this task. Qiwu himself has worked in the old society for a long time and has many shortcomings. Today, he is honored to serve the people and sees the rapid progress in military, political, production, and construction across the country. In particular, he feels infinite gratitude and excitement. Please give us more criticism and encourage our progress.

　　绥远省人民政府主席
    董其武关于绥远工作情况的报告
    【新华社十五日讯】绥远省人民政府董其武主席关于绥远工作情况的报告（一九五○年四月十四日在政务院第二十八次政务会议上），全文如下：
    绥远土地约三十余万平方公里，人口仅二百三十六万余人。全年雨量平均三三六公分，一般说来是比较干旱的地区。可是由黄河流贯绥西绥中，造成天然的灌溉区域，所以除去伊克昭盟及乌兰察布盟部分沙漠地区外，大都是既宜于农作又宜于牧畜的地区。就农业生产来说，绥东、绥中、绥西各县，从来都是粮食可以输出邻省的区域。特别是绥西的后套，沃野平原有一千七百余公里的干支渠道，可以利用黄水灌溉。可耕土地一千五百余万亩，常年耕种的面积，仅三百万亩左右。根据黄河水利委员会的勘测设计，短期间还可扩展一千万亩的水田面积。后套土地平整，没有经过细小的分割，最适宜于机器的耕种。作物生长全年为一六五天，除去棉产发展比较困难以外，其余作物，试验推广，均有成绩。这一切都可以说明：绥远过去，因封建官僚资产阶级的长期统治，是比较落后的地区，可是将来在农业生产的发展上，具有非常优越的条件。这是绥远的第一个特点。
    关于工矿方面：绥远的矿产，根据已有调查约有四亿八千万吨的煤（可能储藏量为六亿吨），四千万吨的铁，五万吨的石绵，三十万吨的云母，和年产十五万吨的石墨，年产十五万吨的自然碱，年产三百万斤的盐。其他稀有金属如钨等，尚有十余种。不但资源丰富，而且这些矿区的分布，都接近铁路交通，在开采上有不少的便利，工业方面的制革业、毛织业、造纸业、面粉业、现在基础虽极薄弱，但因原料丰富，将来都有发展的可能。这是绥远的第二个特点。
    第三个特点：绥远是多民族聚居的区域。全省人口二百三十万人，蒙胞即占二十万左右，归绥、包头、丰镇各地，还有一部分回胞。现在绥远的行政区划，除去四个专署以外，有伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟、土默特旗、绥东四旗（正红、正黄、镶黄、镶蓝），都是蒙胞集居或蒙汉聚居的地区。
    另外，绥远是通过起义和平解放的地区，也使我们的工作进行与其他省份有不全相同的地方，自去年北京和平解放以后，绥远就一直酝酿着和平，但当时干部意见还很纷歧。后来阎锡山回光返照，当了伪行政院长，自以为他与绥远军队有些历史的关系，妄想拉拢绥远部队，作为他在伪政府的政治资本，帮助蒋介石的垂死挣扎，派遣特务，进行分化、收买和破坏，更增加了起义的困难。但是由于解放战争在全国范围的胜利发展，由于中国共产党与毛主席政策的伟大，以及傅作义先生与各级干部的努力，终于完成了和平的解放。半年以来，我们始终遵照毛主席的指示，进行“团结一致力求进步，改革旧制度，实行新政策，为建设人民的新绥远而奋斗”的各种工作。
    现在我把各项具体工作进行的情形，简要报告如左：
    第一、关于政权改造方面：
    自从绥远起义以后，绥东绥西的干部，就分别进行了对于毛主席指示与政协文件的深入学习，以作思想的准备。绥西方面并作了并编军队、减少番号、撤销政工制度、扣捕特务分子等等的准备工作。同时绥东亦派了联络人员，先行实现了铁路、银行、公路的统一管理。及至十二月二日，中央人民政府第四次委员会通过了绥远军政委员会与绥远省人民政府主席副主席与委员名单，十二月十三日人民革命军事委员会任命了绥远军区各负责人员，十二月二十七日，绥远军政委员会在归绥正式成立，今年一月一日，绥远省人民政府和绥远军区同时成立。在三个月的当中，进行了一系列的工作。
    一、调整行政区划：将归绥、包头两市列为省辖，原有陕坝市，因经济、文化及交通条件不够，列为陕坝专署直辖镇。乌兰察布盟，除百灵庙办事处撤销外，仍辖四子王旗、达尔罕旗、茂明安旗、东公旗、西公旗、中公旗等六个旗。伊克昭盟，原辖札萨克旗、达拉特旗、杭锦旗、鄂托克旗、郡王旗、准格尔旗、乌审旗等七个旗。除撤销达拉特旗民众组训处、桃力民办事处、杭锦旗代营处外，并划东胜县归该盟领导。绥东四旗办事处撤销，以正红旗为中心旗，其余正黄、镶黄、镶蓝三旗按甲种区编制，归中心旗领导。土默特旗，为了照顾该旗历史的与现存的特殊情况，在行政设施上，暂维现状，沿用蒙汉分治、旗县并存的办法，成立土默特旗人民政府，直属绥远省人民政府领导，河东站台地，亦划归土默特旗人民政府领导。其余二十二个县，除东胜划归伊盟自治区人民政府领导外，划为四个专员区、集宁专署，辖集宁、丰镇、兴和、陶林、龙胜、武东等六县。和林专署，辖和林、清水河、托克托、凉城等四县。包头专署，辖包头、武川、固阳、归绥、萨拉齐等五县。陕坝专署，辖五原、狼山、晏江、安北、米仓、临河等六县，及陕坝镇。
    二、制定一九五零年的施政方针：针对绥远的具体情况，制定了下列八项绥远的施政方针：（一）剿匪肃特，安定社会秩序。（二）建立和加强人民民主统一阵线。（三）适应当前农民的迫切需要，恢复并发展农业生产，实行二五减租，并准备土地改革的基础。（四）发动并组织工人、农民、青年、妇女等人民团体，并使之成为各项建设有力的可靠支柱。（五）经济建设：遵照共同纲领中“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的政策，以达“发展生产、繁荣经济”的目的。目前具体的方针，则首先是恢复与发展农牧业、手工业、并逐渐恢复工矿业，以便促进绥远的社会经济。（六）整理财政，整理税收，增加收入，精简节约，以达成发展生产，保障供给的目的。（七）实行新民主主义的科学文化教育，同时注意扶助少数民族文化，开展各盟旗教育工作。（八）坚决执行人民政协共同纲领所规定的民族政策，反对大民族主义，和狭隘的民族主义，防止一切民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂民族团结的行为，巩固蒙、汉、回团结，实行民族的区域自治，发展蒙、回民政治、经济、文化教育的建设事业。各级蒙旗政府、实行民主改革，建立各级蒙古人民代表会议，整编蒙古武装建立新的军事政治制度，有计划地适当地解决过去蒙、汉存在过的纠纷，如土地、水草、渡口等纠纷。
    三、政权改造工作：在政权改造过程中，包括着几个步骤：第一、合并省政机构，安置原来绥西的干部。现在这个工作已经初步完成。在合并之初，由于过去思想的体系不同，绥西的一部分干部，免不了怀着一些疑虑。但经过人事的酝酿调配以后，每个人都给了工作或学习的机会，在分配人员的比例上，就科长一级而言，绥东占百分之四三·五，绥西占百分之五六·五，充分的事实证明，造成了团结的踏实基础。第二、合并的结果，不仅要求形式的统一，主要地还是要做到制度的统一，思想认识，工作作风，各方面的一致。所以，学习的领导，便成了重要的工作。自从绥远军政委员会和绥远省人民政府、绥远军区相继成立以后，即正式成立了绥远军政干部学习团，与原有的绥远省行政干部学校，进行着分工的干部教育。同时，军政委员会对于在职干部的学习，亦特别加强，制定计划，统一领导，成立学委总会，各机关部队，成立学委分会支会。每天坚持两小时的学习，三个月以来的成就，就学习团来说，第一期参加学习的，计有现职干部一千二百七十一人，无职干部一千四百六十三人，共二千九百三十四人。原定现职干部学习一个半月，无职干部学习三个月，从二月一日起，学习了两个月，为了工作的需要，毕业一千五百十四人，其余一千二百二十人，留团继续学习。就行政干校来说，由在职干部，调训了两次，第一次省级干部一百四十人，市县干部五百人，第二次省级干部一百人，市县级干部二百五十人，共九百九十人。再就在职干部的学习情况来说，已举行了四个学习单元，都有计划、有布置、有测验、有总结。在学习过程当中，由于高级负责干部如高克林同志、姚哲同志、杨植霖同志等和共产党员及其他老干部正确地执行了毛主席的指示，“坚决团结，耐心教育改造”的结果，亦由于绥西干部改造自己的觉悟和决心，一般学习情况，都具有很好的成绩。第三，在民主建政与基层政权的改造工作方面，一九五○年的施政方针，曾经规定市县改组，及召开各级的各界人民代表会议。依照民主原则，有计划，有步骤的改造各级政权，废除保甲制度。并规定三万人以上的城市，于合并后两个月内召开各界人民代表会议，各县旂于合并后，四个月内召开各界人民代表会议。区村则建立农会，由农民代表会议先行代替人民代表会议的工作。现在绥东各县，因为解放较早，已召开了第二届各界人民代表会议，绥中的归绥、包头两市，和归绥和林等县，已召开第一届各界人民代表会议。绥西各县现正由生产建政工作团，传达中央生产工作的指示，并结合生产，组织群众，为不久即将召开的各界人民代表会议建立基础，准备条件，“把绥远建设成真正的人民解放区”。
    第二、关于部队整编方面：
    这部分的工作，也和政权改造工作一样，首先进行了说服教育，其次召集了各军师旅长级的干部，成立高级干部研究班，将人民解放军的性质与建军原则，各种制度，彻底研究，然后结合实际订立整编方案，酝酿干部配备，并于各部队进行思想动员，然后按照整编方案，建立各级的政治制度及其他制度，将部队整编完毕。同时，在成立高级干部研究班以外，还召集了参谋人员会议，学习人民解放军的参谋业务，又召集了供给人员会议，学习人民解放军的供给制度。这三个会议，都收到良好的效果，促成我们把军队改编成为真正的人民解放军。另外，召集了营长以上的干部到学习团学习，使他们得到更深一层的认识和了解。军区司令部预定在二月十日以前，完成调防的准备工作，二月二十日，各按防区调动完毕，三月中旬，将整编工作进行完毕。现在各部队正在生产地区执行毛主席的指示，从事生产。至于军队生产的情况，留在报告生产问题中，加以说明。
    第三、关于剿匪肃特安定社会秩序方面：
    绥远匪特存在和发展的原因，首先由于人民历年遭受封建地主阶级残酷剥削，与日寇数年烧杀压迫，逼使人民无法生活，挺而走险，成为土匪；其次在蒋介石反动统治之下，特务活动，绥远亦难例外。九一九起义以前，有些特务分子，来绥进行离间分化工作。目前除了扣捕和自首以外，可能尚有潜伏的残余匪徒阴谋从事破坏工作。我们根据这些情况，决定剿匪肃特的方针，是积极发动与组织广大群众，做好军队整编工作和政权改造工作，并切实贯彻争取教育改造政策，与减租，民主建政，经济建设等工作，密切结合，来加强政治上的瓦解和军事搜剿。同时，把工作的重点，放在交通线上，和匪特经常活动的伊盟后套地区以及两行政区的结合部。
    扣捕匪特，在“九一九”以后，即扣捕了七十余人，以后还陆续扣捕，前后搜获大小电台十八部。在清剿土匪方面，除了还有三五结伙或零星散匪外，绥远全境，已没有股匪。我们争取在一九五零年内把绥远境内的流散土匪与潜伏隐藏的特务分子，在基本上予以肃清。
    第四、关于生产工作方面：
    今年绥远省的农业生产，是以恢复为主，在恢复的基础上求发展。中央要求本省的任务是：生产杂粮十六亿斤，成活林木一百万株，繁殖大牲畜六万头。
    为了完成这个任务，我们首先是广泛的宣传了“奖励生产”“劳动致富”的政策，明确宣布坚决保护中农的利益，合理负担的政策，以稳定各阶层的生产情绪；同时，并大力帮助贫苦农民，解决生产的困难问题，解决牛犋与劳力问题，解决口粮籽种问题，都根据各地区的不同情况，订有具体的办法。总计本省可耕地，约五千余万亩，一九三七年前，已耕地约三千万亩，历年因战争降低到约二千万亩，自从接受到中央的任务以后，经招集农业生产水利会议，仔细计算分配，今年必须种地二千四百七十余万亩，始能完成本年的生产任务。
    为了保证农业生产计划的完成，水利事业，也视为重要工作之一。今年总计，由政府协助群众兴修的中型水利，如：开挖武东归绥的朝代渠、通梢狼山的三大股渠、建修凉城的脑包渠、整修归绥的万家渠、萨县的麦达沟，以及由群众自行举办的小型水利，如：丰镇、和林、凉城、兴和、龙胜、武东、归绥、伊盟等处，共计六十七处，可以增加灌溉面积九十七万八千二百亩。大型水利工程，如绥西的四首制闸全部完成，可以增加灌溉一千万亩，霸王河民阜渠的完成，可以灌溉二十二万亩；黄河左岸防洪堤的完成，可以保护耕地二十六万亩；后套与三湖河水田的大灌溉区，本省水利局也拟协助黄河水利委员会测量队，完成勘测设计工作，将来大黑河淤灌工程完成，灌溉面积，将很有可观，土地更比后套肥沃。
    关于林业方面，中央要求本年成活一百万株，现已恢复省立苗圃七处，预计机关学校每人植树两株，群众分春秋两季植树，全省共植二百四十三万七千余株。已订奖励和保护的办法，将来成活株数，可能超过中央所分配成活的任务。
    今年繁殖大牲畜六万头。在绥远经过十几年战争的影响，家畜减少到百分之五十以下，增加繁殖这个数字，是个艰巨的任务。不过，我们在农业生产水利会议上，仔细计算，亦坚决要求完成。总计今年在现有牲畜的基础上，增殖牛百分之八（约四万八千八百余头），马百分之八（约一万一千余匹），驴百分之十（约七千五百余头），绵羊百分之二十（约二十七万一千七百余只），山羊百分之二十五（约八万八千九百余只），同时提倡副业，鼓励人民普遍养猪、养鸡预计五人一猪，一人两鸡，约可养猪二十七万余只，养鸡二百三十六万余只，其他园艺蔬果，今年争取本省足用。
    关于部队生产，决定战斗部队以三分之二的人员参加，机关方面，以三分之一的人员参加，总计参加生产人数为五万八千余人，可种地约四十余万亩，平均每亩以收粗粮七○斤计算，可收粗粮二千八百万斤。其他种菜、养猪、养鸡，用以改良伙食，增加营养。
    为保证上述计划的实现，省府最近组织春耕工作检查团，分赴各县旗督导检查。由厅长级以下的干部一百八十余人参加。出发之前，曾举行过四天会议，说明各地的具体情况，和这次的主要任务是宣传政策、推动生产、适当的解决困难，稳定并提高农民的生产情绪，以完成今年的生产任务。决定每县旗各派一个团，各团到达工作地区后，工作期限为五十日，由于深入了解情况，及时解决问题，对本年恢复和增加生产可起很大的推动作用。
    第五、关于税收公债及财经统一工作方面：
    除农业生产与造林、水利以外，本省其他的财经工作，只提出三点来报告。
    第一关于税收工作。中央核定本省五○年的税收任务，为六千六百八十万斤，经过两次税务会议的研究，预期可能超过任务。据第一季（一至三月旺月）的总计，我省共收二千八百八十二万斤，已占中央核定本省全年任务的百分之四十三，按这季来说，已经是超额的完成。
    其次，是推销公债。中央原分配我省四十万分，因元月份省政刚才合并，归包各市县，亦正在进行改组，故宣传工作未能热烈展开。等到二月初旬，才大力的进行推销工作，截至三月二十九日人民银行实收债额，为四十一万二千一百一十四分，现在全省推销公债任务已超额完成。
    再其次，是关于中央颁布统一国家财政经济工作的决定。本省发动学习，由精读文件到提出问题，讨论问题，然后结合实际试拟精简节约方案。经过两周来的热烈讨论，并陆续阅读了中央颁布的一系列文件，全体上下热烈拥护这一个决定，并决心贯彻执行这一个决定。四月一日便由绥远军政委员会与省人民政府共同组织编制委员会和仓库物资清查委员会，并积极清查粮食，建立仓库，改正过去分散窖藏的方法，准备担当中央付予调配粮食的任务。
    第六、关于民族政策方面：
    绥远是一个多民族的地区，是几个民族（蒙汉回）杂居的地区，各民族间存在着的错综复杂关系。在反动的制度下，各民族间要想团结和友爱，是不可能的，这次由于人民解放战争的胜利共同纲领民族政策的正确规定，为全国各民族人民所拥护，加之乌兰夫副主席的亲临领导，使得绥远若干年来的不能解决的民族问题，顺利的得到初步的解决，共同制定了“解决绥远蒙古民族问题的方案”。根据这个方案，现在乌伊两盟已经在绥远军政委员会绥远省军区与绥远人民政府的统一领导之下，成立伊盟自治区人民政府、伊盟军分区、乌盟自治区人民政府、乌盟军分区、并在各盟设立了人民银行贸易机构，以准备发展各旗的经济。当然目前的成绩还是很小的，但是由于这个平等互助的新的民族关系上，我们已可看见人民绥远的新的前途，我们有信心要把绥远变成各民族团结友爱的大家庭。
    第七、几点意见：
    一、在全国粮食不足调配困难的情况下，我们认为假如政府能把京绥铁路延长到西山咀或陕坝，则不但绥西的粮产可以很快的运出来，同时结合宁夏到绥远的黄河航运宁夏的粮食也可以很快的运出来，包头到西山咀完全是平路，并没有很大的困难。
    二、伊盟的碱，中央重工业部已经派员调查，快要着手开采，但是问题仍然是在运输上面，我们希望先修从包头到鄂托克旗的公路。这是第二点意见。
    三、绥远的矿产，大都离铁道线不远，如能及早开采，可以增加国家财富。这是第三点意见。
    第八、结语：
    总结前面的报告，绥远和其他的兄弟省份比较，绥远是生产比较落后的省份。可是由于自然条件的优越，与地广人稀，无论在农牧工矿方面都蕴藏着广大发展的前途。我们手里虽然抱个破碗，地下却埋藏着黄金。其次绥远和其他的兄弟省份比较，绥远解放较晚，一切落后一步。但是我们每个干部都抱着炽热的心情要向毛主席学习，要向共产党学习，要向兄弟省份学习，以迎接伟大的生产与建政任务，要完成这个任务，并超过这个任务。其武个人过去在旧社会工作较久，缺点甚多，今天得光荣地为人民服务，看见全国军事政治生产建设的突飞猛进，尤其感觉无限的感激与兴奋。请多赐批评，策励我们的进步。
