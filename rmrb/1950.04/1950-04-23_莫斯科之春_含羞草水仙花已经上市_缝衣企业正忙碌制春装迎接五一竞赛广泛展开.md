Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: TASS Moscow—Spring has already awakened in Moscow. Mimosa and daffodils are already on sale. On the Moscow River, yachts have begun to sail on the glistening blue waves. A vast army of gardeners is working in the city's boulevards, parks, and squares, planting approximately 500,000 trees and shrubs this April. Flowers and trees for Moscow's May Day decorations are being cultivated in greenhouses or hotbeds. A new feature this spring is the steel skeleton of the twenty-five-story buildings, the Moscow University buildings, and other high-rise buildings in the capital are getting higher and higher. Dozens of new apartment buildings will be completed by International Labor Day on May 1st.

The approach of May Day can be felt from the booming trade. Clothing enterprises are busy making orders for spring and summer clothing. Millions of Muscovites are participating in the socialist competition to celebrate May Day. The Soviet people will produce as many textiles, shoes, machines, and other essential items to strengthen the Soviet national economy and further improve the lives of Soviet citizens, to welcome this festival that symbolizes the struggle of working people all over the world for friendship and peace.

    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：春天已经在莫斯科苏醒过来了。含羞草和水仙花已经上市。在莫斯科河上，游艇已开始驶进潾潾碧波。园艺工作者的浩浩大军，正在城内各林荫大道、公园和广场中工作着，四月份将种植约五十万株树木和灌木。供莫斯科五一节装饰之用的花木，正在温室或温床中培育着。今春的新特色，是高达二十五层的建筑物的钢骨架、莫斯科大学的建筑物和首都各区的其他高楼大厦，正在越来越加高。到五一国际劳动节为止，将有数十幢新的公寓房屋落成。
    五一节的临近，从贸易的兴隆可以感到。各缝衣企业正忙碌制春装与夏装的定货。千千万万莫斯科人正在参加庆祝五一节的社会主义竞赛。苏联人民要生产尽可能多的纺织物、鞋、机器，及其他增强苏联国民经济，并进一步提高苏联公民生活的必需物品，来迎接这个象征着全世界劳动人民为友谊与和平而斗争的节日。
