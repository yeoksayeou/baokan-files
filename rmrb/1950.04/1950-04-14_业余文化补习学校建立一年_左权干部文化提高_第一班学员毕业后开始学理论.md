Establishment of Amateur Cultural Tutoring School for One Year
    Left-wing Cadres' Cultural Level Raised
    First Class Graduates Begin to Study Theory
    [Our Newspaper] Since the establishment of the amateur cultural tutoring school for in-service cadres at the county level in Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, in February of last year, it has achieved considerable success. Over the past year, everyone has developed the habit of learning and increased their interest in learning. Students are able to attend classes on time each time; when they are not in class, they can also persist in self-study in the office. Liu Bingcheng, a section chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Le Shenggen, a cadre of the county government who is over fifty years old, also frequently write diaries and look for people to do arithmetic and recognize new characters whenever they have time. In terms of academic achievement: the first class of students (most of whom were originally at the level of higher primary school) have learned 52 lessons of intermediate Chinese (Book 1 and Book 2) in the past year, have learned to use punctuation marks, and have improved their writing ability. For example, Li Guohua, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the county government, could not write official letters at the beginning of last year, but now he can write ordinary official letters to superiors and subordinates. The students in this class graduated in March of this year, no longer attend classes, and have begun to study theory mainly through self-study (the first volume of the Reader of the Chinese Revolution). The second class of students originally had a level of senior first year and junior primary school fourth grade, and now most of them have a level of senior first year and senior second year. Forty of the fifty-six people have been promoted to the first class. The third class has a total of thirty-four people, originally semi-literate or illiterate, and now can write simple letters, and twenty-eight people are preparing to be promoted to the second class. In addition, all classes have studied arithmetic and improved their ideological understanding through political study, and have also made improvements in their work.
    The above achievements are inseparable from the long-term persistence and consolidation of the amateur school. When the school was first established, because there was no fixed school building, textbooks were also lacking, and the students' levels were uneven, and there was no habit of learning, the interest of both teachers and students was not high, and it was close to being interrupted. Later, under the active leadership of the Zuoquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the one hand, ideological mobilization was carried out, and the county committee personally lectured; on the other hand, a school site was selected, and loose-leaf textbooks suitable for the cadres' tastes were selected and printed. Then, after consulting with various agencies, three dan and one dou of millet were collected from the surplus grain of the various agencies' food, and the entire student body voluntarily prepared desks and stools for class use.
    At the same time, a system of roll call, leave, make-up classes, and assigning homework to the countryside was established, and regular teaching improvement meetings were held (once a month) to gradually study and improve teaching methods, ensuring the timely implementation of the teaching plan. Many activists emerged in the study, such as Li Shuyuan of the County Committee, Zhang Shengjiang and Li Guohua of the County Government, who not only arrived on time themselves when it was time to study, but also promoted others to go to study on time. For example, Liu Yujiang and Han Guihe, orderlies of the County Committee, were afraid of missing class in the morning, so they finished sweeping the floor and wiping the table at night. The exemplary actions of these comrades also directly promoted everyone's enthusiasm for learning. (Pei Xiaoxian, Hao Fujing)

　　业余文化补习学校建立一年
    左权干部文化提高
    第一班学员毕业后开始学理论
    【本报讯】山西省左权县县级机关在职干部业余文化补习学校，自去年二月开办以来，已获相当成绩。一年来已养成大家的学习的习惯，提高了学习兴趣。学员们每次均能按时上课；不上课时，亦能坚持在机关自学。公安局股长刘秉诚、县府年过五十岁的乐生根等，并经常写日记，一有时间就找人演算术，认生字。在学习的成绩方面：第一班学员（绝大部分原为高小程度）一年来学了中等国文（一册和二册）五十二课，已学会使用标点符号，并提高了写作能力。如县府民政科员李国华，去年开春还不会写公文信件，现在往上下的普通公文信件都能写了。该班学员已于今年三月间毕业，不再上课，开始进行以自学为主的理论学习（中国革命读本上册）。第二班学员原为高一和初小四年级程度，现绝大部分都有了高一和高二的程度。五十六人中已有四十人升入一班。第三班共三十四人，原为半文盲或文盲，现已会写简单信件，已有二十八人准备升入二班。此外各班都学习了算术，并通过政治学习提高了思想认识，在工作上也有了改进。
    以上成绩的获得，是和业余学校能长期坚持与巩固分不开的。学校初成立时，因没有固定校址，课本也缺乏，加之学员程度参差不齐，又无学习习惯，因此教的和学的双方兴趣都不高，已接近中断状态。后经中共县委的主动领导，一方面进行思想动员，县委亲自讲课；另一方面择定校址，并选印了适合干部口味的活页课本。接着，又和各机关研究，在各机关伙食节余粮食中，凑集了三石一斗小米，并由全体学员的自愿劳动，制备了上课用的桌凳等物。
    同时，订立了点名、请假、补课、布置下乡作业等制度，并定期召开教学改进会（每月一次），逐渐的研究改进了教学方法。保证了教学计划的按期实现。学习中产生了不少积极分子，如县委会的李树园、县政府的张生江、李国华等，一到学习时间，不但自己按时到，而且能推动别人也按时去学习。又如县委会的勤务员刘玉江、韩贵和，怕早上误了上课，黑夜就赶完扫地、抹桌等工作，这些同志的模范行动，也直接推动了大家学习的积极性。（裴效先、郝馥菁）
