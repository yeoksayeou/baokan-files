Individual Newspaper Vendors Randomly Shout "Extra!" - Relevant Authorities Should Correct This

To the Editor:

　　On the evening of the 6th of this month, at 11 PM, when everyone was already asleep, four or five newspaper vendors in the Fuxue Hutong, Jianzi Xiang area, were loudly shouting about an "Extra!" and claiming it was news about "Recovering Taiwan." Many of our comrades were awakened by this noise and hurried out to buy two copies. At the time, the main gate was already locked, and the newspaper vendors stuffed the newspapers through the crack in the door and left. Upon turning on the light to examine it, it turned out to be a copy of the "New Life Evening News" published in Tianjin on April 5th, and there was no news about "Recovering Taiwan" at all. Only on the fourth page was there a news item stating, "The Hudong District Sports Meet is scheduled to be held at the end of the month, with bayonet drills including 'attacking Taiwan' as part of the program." The next morning, we heard that many others had been similarly deceived. Therefore, in order to maintain social order, I suggest that the relevant authorities conduct educational work with these irresponsible newspaper vendors.

　　个别报贩乱叫号外  有关机关应予纠正编辑同志：
    本月六日晚上十一时，大家都已熟睡，在府学胡同中剪子巷一带，有四五个报贩高声叫卖“号外”，且说是关于“收复台湾”的消息。我们很多同志被这声音唤醒，赶紧出去买了两份。当时大门已上锁，报贩把报由门缝塞进就走掉了。回来打开电灯一看，原来是一张四月五日天津出版的“新生晚报”，并且其中并无“收复台湾”的消息，仅在第四版上登载着“沪东区运动会定月底举行，有打台湾等刺枪表演节目”的新闻一则。第二天早上，我们听说与我们同样受骗者很多。因此，为了维持社会秩序，我建议有关机关对这些不负责任叫卖的报贩进行教育工作。
