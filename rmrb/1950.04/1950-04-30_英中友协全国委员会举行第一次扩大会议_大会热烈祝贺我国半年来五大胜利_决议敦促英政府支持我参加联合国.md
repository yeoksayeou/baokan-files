　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 29th: London Airmail: The Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association, established at the Anglo-Chinese Conference on December 4, 1949, held its first enlarged meeting of the National Committee on April 22nd. The meeting was attended by the Executive Committee of the Electrical Trades Union, the Civil Service Alliance, the Socialist Medical Association, the University Labour Federation, eight local trade union committees, two district committees of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Miners' Union, the local branch of the Post Office Engineering Union and the National Union of Vehicle Builders, as well as representatives of the British Communist Party.

　　The National Committee warmly congratulates the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Government on the five great victories in the past six months: military victory, political victory, victory in railway transportation, financial victory, and victory in grain allocation.

　　The National Committee approved the charter and work plan of the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association and unanimously passed two resolutions: one requesting the British government to support the new China's participation in the United Nations, and the other condemning the United States for continuing to interfere in China. The meeting also decided to send a delegation to deliver the first resolution to the British Foreign Office and to write the second resolution as a letter of protest to the US Embassy in the UK.

　　The first resolution states: "The special meeting of the National Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association urges the British government to give wholehearted support to China's demand to enter its rightful seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and to expel the current representative of Chiang Kai-shek, who has been abandoned by the Chinese people.

　　This committee considers it inappropriate for the British government to abstain when this issue is voted on in the Security Council and to be absent or vote in favor of Chiang Kai-shek's representatives when this matter is raised in other United Nations committees.

　　If the recognition of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on January 6 is to be realized, it can only be achieved if the British government unconditionally supports China's rights in all international fora and strives for China's claims in any committee of the United Nations."

　　The General Assembly condemns US imperialism for interfering in our country
　　Demanding an end to aid to the remaining bandits

　　The second resolution states: "The special meeting of the National Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association demands that, from now on, the US government should stop giving any direct or indirect aid to Chiang Kai-shek or to Chiang Kai-shek's supporters in Taiwan or any other part of China. This includes aid to him through the Economic Cooperation Administration, including US munitions purchased with the unused portion of US Congressional loans, and indirect aid provided through the Philippines and Japan.

　　Chiang Kai-shek is using this aid to bomb Chinese cities, massacre and harm the Chinese people, and blockade Chinese trade.

　　As long as this aid continues, world opinion will hold the US government responsible for the massacres and destruction carried out by Chiang Kai-shek and also responsible for China's inability to return to a peaceful situation."

　　英中友协全国委员会举行第一次扩大会议
    大会热烈祝贺我国半年来五大胜利
    决议敦促英政府支持我参加联合国
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】伦敦航讯：在一九四九年十二月四日英中会议上成立的英中友好协会，于四月二十二日举行第一次全国委员会扩大会议。出席此次会议的有电器工会执行委员会，公务员联盟，社会主义医学协会，大学劳工联合会，八个地方工会委员会，混合机器工会的两个区委员会，矿工联盟，邮局机械工人工会与全国造车工人联合会的地方分会，以及英国共产党的代表多人。
    全国委员会热烈地祝贺中国人民及中国人民政府在过去六个月中的五大胜利：军事胜利、政治胜利、铁道运输上的胜利、财政胜利和粮食调拨的胜利。
    全国委员会批准了英中友好协会的章程与干事会的工作计划，并一致通过要求英国政府支持新中国参加联合国及斥责美国继续干涉中国的两个决议。会议并决定派遣代表团把第一个决议送交英国外交部，把第二个决议写成抗议书送交美国驻英大使馆。
    第一个决议宣称：“英中友好协会全国委员会特别会议敦促英国政府：对中国要求进入它在联合国安理会的常任理事国这个应得的席位，及驱逐已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石的现任代表，应给予全心全意的支持。
    本委员会对于英国政府当这一问题在安理会投票时弃权以及当此事在其他联合国委员会上提出时不是缺席便是投票赞成蒋介石的代表等事，认为不当。
    如欲使一月六日对中华人民共和国中央人民政府之承认实现，唯有英国政府无条件地在一切国际场合支持中国的权利，并在联合国的任何一个委员会上为中国的主张而力争，方能获致。”
    大会斥责美帝干涉我国
    要求停止援助残匪
    第二个决议宣称：“英中友好协会全国委员会特别会议要求，从今以后，美国政府应停止以任何直接或间接的援助给予蒋介石或给予中国的台湾及其他任何地方的蒋介石支持者。这包括经由经合总署给他的援助，包括以美国国会贷款的未用部分购买的美国军火，以及通过菲律宾和日本给予的间接援助。
    蒋介石就是利用这些援助来轰炸中国城市，屠杀残害中国人民，并封锁中国的贸易的。
    只要这种援助继续一日，全世界的舆论就认为美国政府应对蒋介石进行的屠杀和破坏负责，并且也要对中国不能回复和平情况负责。”
