　　Record of the Liberation of Weizhou Island
    Shi Ye
    On March 6th, the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army received the order to attack Weizhou Island. The soldiers quickly boarded the ships, conducting one last mutual check of their firing positions. At 6:30 PM, the order to depart was given. The ships quickly formed a neat combat formation, raised their sails, and sped directly towards Weizhou Island.

    During the voyage, the wind and waves were strong. Having undergone months of maritime training, the northern soldiers no longer felt dizzy or uncomfortable. As the night deepened, the waves grew larger, and the ocean was shrouded in thick fog. Each ship carefully maintained its course, pushing through the waves and advancing rapidly. The sail of one ship was torn by the wind. Sailor Hu Yongsheng immediately climbed the mast and used a quilt to repair the sail. The rudder of another ship broke, and helmsman Yang Gonglong used his arm to hold it in place for over ten *li*. Everyone had only one concentrated will: "Land on Weizhou Island quickly!"

    After seven hours of battling the wind and waves, a piece of land appeared faintly in the distance. This was Weizhou Island, lying at the northern end of the Gulf of Tonkin, controlling the traffic between Hainan Island and Beihai, and serving as the most important barrier for the remaining bandits on Hainan Island.

    When our army was about a hundred meters from the shore, the enemy's machine guns opened fire. The ship carrying the Second Platoon of the Fifth Company was in the lead. As soon as the order to attack was given, Wang Xuelin, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad, led his entire squad, first jumping into the waist-deep water. Braving the enemy's intense fire, the soldiers advanced through the churning sea and landed in quick succession within three minutes, seizing the enemy's beachhead. Two red signal flares immediately rose into the dark night sky. The troops surged forward, with the boatmen shouting "Charge!" to cheer on the soldiers.

    Along the more than three-li coastline from Beiwang in the east to Xijiao in the west of Weizhou Island, the PLA landing forces thrust like several sharp knives into the enemy's nest. The Fifth Company, which landed first, crossed the muddy swamps and jungle thickets, and in just half an hour, occupied the commanding height of Wanting Mountain on the island, tightly controlling the bandit command post and Weizhou Bay, where a large number of enemy ships were berthed. The enemy's Second Navy Company, hiding in the bay, was captured just as they awoke from their dreams.

    At the same time as the Fifth Company seized the high ground, three PLA motorized sailing gunboats also sailed into Weizhou Bay harbor to block the port and intercept enemy ships. The enemy ship "Haishuo" was cowering in the harbor. The "Zhuang Deli," commanded by company commander Shi Longsheng, rushed forward to meet it head-on. When it was fifty or sixty meters away from the enemy ship, the anti-tank guns and light and heavy machine guns on the "Zhuang Deli" opened fire fiercely at the "Haishuo." The enemy ship returned fire with its cannons. Thereupon, the "Zhuang Deli" and the other two gunboats spread out, with another gunboat commanded by Battalion Commander Chen rushing up to cooperate in the battle, unfolding a fierce naval battle. The enemy ship was finally damaged and fled in a state of panic towards the southeast. Our three gunboats pursued for three or four *li*, then turned back and intercepted more than three hundred enemy ships that had not had time to escape.

    Just as dawn broke, the hundred or so remaining bandits, trapped in the enemy command post's strong fortifications, surrendered after a barrage of our artillery fire. From 2:00 AM on the 6th to 10:00 AM the next morning, the entire battle lasted eight hours, and Weizhou Island was liberated. Our army captured 436 bandits, including Gan Zongzheng, the colonel chief of staff of the "Guangdong Provincial People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense National Salvation Army South Road Command," and killed or wounded sixteen; seized seven mortars and 60mm guns, as well as many other weapons and ammunition.

　　涠州岛解放记
    史耶
    人民解放军第四野战军某部，于三月六日下午接到了向涠州岛进攻的命令。健儿们迅速地上了船，最后一次相互检查了船上的射击位置。下午六时半，出发的号令一下，各船迅速排成一列严整的战斗队形，扬帆疾驶，直指涠州岛。
    前进的航程中，风浪很大，经过了几个月的海上操练的北方健儿们，已不感到头晕难受了。夜愈深，浪愈大，海洋上浓雾弥漫，每个船都谨慎小心地掌握着航行的方向，排波逐浪，向前疾驶。一只船上的帆被海风吹破了。水手胡永胜立即爬上桅杆用夹被将帆修补好。另一只船上的舵坏了，舵手杨宫龙用自己的手臂托着航行了十余里。大家心里只有一个集中的意志：“迅速登陆涠州岛！”
    经过七小时与风浪的搏斗，在不远的地方，隐隐约约地出现一片陆地。这横卧在东京湾北端的、控制着海南岛和北海间的交通的、作为海南岛残匪最重要的屏障的涠州岛在望了。
    当我军离岸百余公尺时，敌人的机关枪响了，五连二排的船驶在最前头，当攻击令一下，船上六班班长王学林首先带着全班跃入齐腰深的海水里。勇士们冒着敌人的密集炮火，在激荡的海水中向前奋进，三分钟内，便相继登陆，夺取了敌人的滩头阵地。黑沉沉的夜空，立刻升起了两颗红色信号弹。部队随即汹涌前进，船工们也喊着“冲呀！”，给勇士们助威。
    从涠州岛东部北弯至西部西角三里多长的海岸线上，解放军登陆部队便象好几把锋锐的尖刀，敏捷地插向敌人的巢穴。最先登陆的五连穿过了泥泞沼泽和丛林荆棘，仅半小时就占领了岛上万顶山制高点，严密地控制了匪指挥所和泊有大批敌船的涠州湾。躲在湾内的匪海军第二连，刚从梦中醒来就当了俘虏。
    和五连夺得制高点同时，解放军三只机帆炮艇也驶入涠州湾港口，来堵塞港口和截击敌舰。敌舰“海硕号”正龟缩在港口里。由石龙生连长指挥的我军炮艇“庄得利号”迎头冲了上去。在距离敌舰五六十米时，“庄得利号”上的战防炮和轻重机枪一齐向“海硕号”猛射。敌舰以机关炮还击。于是，“庄得利号”就和另外两只炮艇分头摆开了阵势，陈营长指挥的另一只炮艇也赶上来配合作战，展开了一场激烈的海战。敌舰最后终被击伤狼狈向东南方向逃走。我三只炮艇跟踪追击了三、四里，回头还截获了未及逃走的敌船三百多只。
    天刚破晓，困守在敌指挥所坚固工事里顽抗的百余名残匪，经我一阵炮火猛击后投降了。自六日午夜二时到次晨十时，全部战斗历八小时，涠州岛解放了。我军俘匪“广东省民众反共自卫救国军南路指挥所”上校参谋长甘宗正以下四百三十六名，毙伤十六名；缴获迫击炮、六零炮七门，以及其他武器弹药甚多。（新华社海南前线二十三日电）
