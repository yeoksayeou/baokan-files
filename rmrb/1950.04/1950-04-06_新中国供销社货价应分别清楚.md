　　New China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Prices Should Be Clearly Distinguished
Editor:
    At noon on March 9th, I went to the New China Supply and Marketing Cooperative to buy recreational supplies for my organization. I bought two sets of "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" checkers at the cooperative, each priced at 7,200 yuan. Because the cooperative only had two sets of "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" checkers, which was not enough for the organization's needs, I went to the stationery store on Xidan North Street and bought a few more sets, which only cost 2,000 yuan per set. I went back to find the sales clerk. After checking, he realized that there used to be a kind of hardboard checkers, which was priced at 7,200 yuan; because the price list was not clearly marked, and they were all written as "checkers," it was confusing. So, he refunded the overcharged money to me. I think the responsible comrades of our business departments must pay attention to distinguishing the prices of goods clearly. If they are confused, it will have a bad impact.

### 新中国供销社货价应分别清楚

　　新中国供销社货价应分别清楚编辑同志：
    三月九日中午，我到新中国供销社去为本机关买文娱用品。我在该社买的两副工农兵跳棋，每副价钱是七千二百元。因为该社只有两副工农兵跳棋，还不够机关所需，所以我又到西单北大街文具店去买了几副，却只要二千元一副。我回去找那位售货员同志。他一查才发觉过去有一种硬盘跳棋，价钱才是七千二百元；因为价目表上登记不清，都写成跳棋，所以便混淆不清了。于是，他便把多收的钱退给我。我觉得我们企业部门负责同志，必须注意把货品价目分别清楚，如果混淆起来那就会造成不好的影响。
