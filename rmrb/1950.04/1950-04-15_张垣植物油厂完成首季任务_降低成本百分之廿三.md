　　Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory Completes First Quarter Task
    Reduces Costs by 23 Percent
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The Zhangjiakou City Chahar Province Industrial Department's Vegetable Oil Factory exceeded its first quarter production plan, reducing costs by more than 23 percent. The factory, through modifying machinery, increasing the revolutions per minute of the central shaft, and launching rationalization proposals and innovation record movements, produced a total of 513,975 jin of oil in the first quarter, exceeding the original plan by 23,975 jin. Due to the rapid increase in oil production rate, the first quarter costs were reduced by 23.11 percent, exceeding the Industrial Department's required reduction of 2 percent. Currently, the factory's average oil production rate for the first quarter is 34.24 percent for flaxseed and 30.67 percent for rapeseed, with the highest oil production rate being 36.65 percent for flaxseed and 35.07 percent for rapeseed, both approaching theoretical figures.
