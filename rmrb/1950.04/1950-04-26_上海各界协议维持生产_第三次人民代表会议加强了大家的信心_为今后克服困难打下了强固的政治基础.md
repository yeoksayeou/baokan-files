Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th—The third Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference, which opened on the 15th of this month, concluded on the 23rd. This conference focused on analyzing the current situation, discussing how to overcome current economic difficulties, and completing Shanghai's public bond and tax revenue tasks. It also re-elected the Shanghai Municipal People's Consultative Committee.

On the first day of the conference, Mayor Chen Yi delivered a report on "Shanghai's Work Tasks." He analyzed the current situation in Shanghai, pointing out that due to the correct and strong leadership of the Central People's Government and the unity of the government and people from all walks of life, Shanghai has largely completed its public bond and tax revenue tasks. Preliminary victories have been achieved in stabilizing prices and preventing enemy air raids. At the same time, he pointed out that Shanghai will still face many difficulties in the future, but a bright future is in sight. As long as we endure and overcome these difficulties, improvement will come. Finally, Mayor Chen put forward the following work tasks for the people of Shanghai in the next four months: supporting the front lines and eliminating remnants of the enemy; maintaining production through labor-capital consultation and establishing new labor-capital relations; providing relief to unemployed workers; completing and exceeding the public bond tasks; and guaranteeing tax revenues.

On the second day of the conference, group discussions were held. On the third day, supplementary reports were heard from Gu Zhun, Director of the Finance Bureau; Cao Manzhi, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau; Ma Chungu, Director of the Labor Bureau; Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions; and Hu Juewen, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, on "Financial and Tax Work," "Public Bond Promotion Work," "Winter Relief and Evacuation of Refugees Back to Their Hometowns for Production," "Current Labor-Capital Relations and Proposal for the Organization of Consultation Meetings," "On the Relief of Unemployed Workers and the Maintenance of Production," and "On Maintaining Industrial and Commercial Production." From the fourth day, group discussions were held for three consecutive days, followed by two days of comprehensive speeches at the general assembly.

The representatives unanimously endorsed Mayor Chen's report and further recognized that Shanghai's current difficulties were caused by the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and are inevitable difficulties encountered in the process of new birth. They believe that as long as they have firm confidence, unite as one, and everyone comes up with solutions, any difficulty can be overcome. The representatives unanimously praised the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, which has stabilized prices and brought national revenue and expenditure close to balance, creating a prerequisite for the improvement of the economic situation.

Representatives Provide Various Experiences for Maintaining Production Methods

Regarding the issue of maintaining production, representatives from all walks of life launched enthusiastic discussions with a serious attitude. Representatives from workers, youth, women, culture, education, and other circles provided the conference with various methods and experiences for overcoming difficulties based on their personal experiences over the past four months. Worker representatives used vivid examples to illustrate that under the same difficult circumstances, some factories collapsed because the capitalists lacked confidence in production and failed to effectively change their management methods. However, many factories, due to open and honest unity and consultation between labor and capital, finally maintained production. Representatives of the armed forces, based on their long-term revolutionary struggle experience, put forward three suggestions for overcoming difficulties: to have confidence, to unite and help each other, and to rely on the masses. They also explained that the troops currently still have difficulties, such as the increased self-sufficiency tasks, agricultural production being in a difficult period, and the families of soldiers facing difficulties due to famine. However, they said that after listening to Mayor Chen's report and understanding the current difficulties in Shanghai, they decided not to make any more demands on the government and were determined to overcome their own difficulties by strengthening agricultural production in the troops. Farmers from the suburbs reported on their achievements in overcoming the Chiang Kai-shek floods and water disasters and reported that the area of rice and cotton fields in the suburbs had been expanded. The farmer representatives said: Although there are still serious difficulties, we have confidence that as long as we work hard in production, we can have a good life after the summer harvest. Representatives from industry and commerce believed that the main difficulties for industry and commerce were the lack of funds, sluggish sales of finished products, and poor management, and they were determined to work hard to transform themselves, rely on their own efforts, and overcome difficulties. Chen Mu, a representative of the Military Control Commission, used the actual situation of loans to industry and commerce by Shanghai's public and private banks since liberation to illustrate that the government has made great efforts to solve the problem of funds. As long as the industrial and commercial circles work together to improve production organizations and management methods, they can maintain production. Regarding the sales of industrial products, Wang Daohan, Minister of the East China Industrial Department, used concrete examples to illustrate that the government has gradually given private factories in East China a considerable number of production tasks through ordering methods. At the same time, the government is actively reducing coal prices, electricity costs, and transportation costs to reduce the cost of industrial products. However, the reform of some private enterprises themselves is a very important issue. After a heated discussion, the representatives reached a consensus.

Concern for Relieving Unemployed Workers and Organizing Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings

Representatives from all walks of life paid great attention to and were concerned about the relief of unemployed workers. The representatives were deeply moved by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' initiative to endure pain and propose conditional consideration of leave-without-pay arrangements to take care of the long-term interests of the working class and the entire country, and unanimously and warmly supported the relief of unemployed workers. During the conference, employed workers widely launched a donation campaign to relieve unemployed workers and went to several factories for emergency relief. Representatives of the armed forces stated that they were willing to launch all officers and soldiers to donate one day's food expenses to relieve unemployed workers in difficult situations. Representatives of industry and commerce believed that the temporary relief measures for employees on leave without pay to maintain production must be understood from a positive perspective. If some people think that with the evacuation measures, they can suspend work and close down at will, they will be letting down the authorities' good intentions. Representatives from industry and commerce also assured the conference that industry and commerce would definitely take the main responsibility for relieving unemployed workers.

Regarding the proposal to organize labor-capital consultation meetings in Shanghai's private enterprises, both workers and industry and commerce agreed that this was an important step in further improving labor-capital relations. Worker representative Shen Han pointed out that since the Chiang-American bombing on February 6, Shanghai has encountered serious difficulties. Labor-capital relations seem tense on the surface, but upon careful study, the workers have actively made greater concessions to the capitalists, such as general wage discounts, reduced food, and even tolerating wage arrears from the capitalists, only to maintain production. Production efficiency has also gradually improved. It is also wrong for some capitalists to avoid or run away when they encounter difficulties. Through this discussion, it was shown that the vast majority of industry and commerce are able to stick to their posts, improve labor-capital relations, and do a good job in production.

Industry and Commerce Unanimously Expressed Their Desire to Complete Public Bonds and Tax Payments

Regarding the public bond tax revenue task, the representatives unanimously expressed their willingness to make the greatest efforts to complete it. Industry and commerce expressed their determination to find all possible ways to undertake it in the face of difficulties and unanimously agreed that the business tax collection method should be changed from self-reporting and actual payment to democratic evaluation to ensure the fulfillment of taxpayers' obligations. However, they hoped to strive for fairness and rationality, on the one hand, to complete the tax revenue task, and on the other hand, to better take care of the actual business situation of various industries.

On the last day of the conference, Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, attended and gave a speech. He pointed out that Shanghai has made great achievements in the year since its liberation due to the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the efforts of people from all walks of life. He emphasized the experience that the Communist Party's fearlessness of difficulties has finally led to the great victory of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Rao's speech further strengthened the representatives' confidence in overcoming difficulties. Then, Mayor Chen Yi pointed out in his concluding speech that the great achievements of this conference have laid a strong political foundation for overcoming difficulties in the future. He called on the representatives to go back and implement the spirit of the conference and widely carry out criticism and self-criticism. Mayor Chen emphasized that this is an important step in overcoming difficulties.

The conference received a total of thirty-seven proposals and four suggestions. The resolutions unanimously adopted by the conference included: "Resolution of the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference on Shanghai's Work Tasks," "Telegram Celebrating the Victory of the Fourth Field Army's Landing on Hainan Island," "Decision on Changing the Business Tax from Self-Reporting and Actual Payment to Democratic Evaluation," "Shanghai Private Enterprise Labor-Capital Consultation Meeting Organization Rules," "Shanghai Temporary Relief Measures for Employees on Leave Without Pay to Maintain Production," and suggestions such as "Establishing the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee" were passed by the conference and handed over to the Municipal Consultative Committee for handling. Other proposals were compiled by the Presidium and submitted to the Municipal Consultative Committee for adoption by the relevant authorities. The conference re-elected the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, adding seventeen members.

　　上海各界协议维持生产
    第三次人民代表会议加强了大家的信心
    为今后克服困难打下了强固的政治基础
    【新华社上海二十五日电】本月十五日召开的上海市第三次各界人民代表会议，已于二十三日结束。这次会议着重分析了当前形势，讨论了如何克服目前经济困难和完成上海应负担的公债、税收任务等问题，并改选沪市各界协商委员会。
    会议第一天由陈毅市长作“上海市工作任务”的报告。他分析了目前上海形势，指出由于中央人民政府正确坚强的领导及政府与各界人民的团结，上海市的公债与税收任务已大部完成；在稳定物价及制止敌机侵袭上取得了初步胜利。同时，他指出今后上海的困难还会有很多，但光明前途已经在望，只要忍受与克服这些困难，就是好转的到来。最后，陈市长提出了上海市人民在今后四个月中支援前线，肃清残敌；劳资协商维持生产，建立新的劳资关系；救济失业工人；完成并超过公债任务；保证税收等工作任务。
    会议第二日进行分组讨论；第三天继续听取财政局局长顾准、民政局局长曹漫之、劳动局局长马纯古、上海总工会主席刘长胜、工商联合会筹备会副主任胡厥文等关于“财政税务工作”、“公债推销工作”、“冬令救济与疏散难民回乡生产工作”、“目前劳资关系及协商会议组织提案”、“关于失业工人救济与维持生产问题”及“关于维持工商业生产问题”等补充报告。会议第四天起连续进行了三天分组讨论和两天大会综合发言。
    代表们对陈市长报告一致表示拥护，并进一步认识了上海目前的困难是由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期反动统治所造成，是新生过程中必然遭遇的困难，只要坚定信心，团结一致，大家想办法，任何困难都是可以克服的。代表们一致赞扬中央人民政府的正确领导，使物价平稳，全国收支接近平衡，给经济情况的好转创造了先决条件。
  代表们以各种经验提供维持生产办法
    关于维持生产问题，各界代表均以认真态度展开了热烈讨论。工人、青年、妇女、文教等各界代表纷纷以四个月来的亲身经历，向大会提供了各种克服困难的办法和经验。工人代表以生动事例说明在同样困难情形下，某些工厂由于资方对生产缺乏信心，不能有效地改变经营方式，使工厂垮了台；而不少工厂则由于劳资双方开诚布公，团结协商，终于维持了生产。部队代表根据长期革命斗争的经验，提出三点克服困难的意见，即：要有信心，要团结互助，要依靠群众。他们还说明部队目前还存在困难，如自给任务的加重，农业生产正处于青黄不接，军属因灾荒而生活困难等。但他们说，在听了陈市长的报告及了解目前上海的困难后，决定不再向政府提出任何要求，决以加强部队农业生产来克服自己的困难。市郊农民报告克服蒋灾、水灾的成绩后，并报告市郊已扩大稻田、棉田面积。农民代表说：虽然目前还有严重困难，但我们有信心，只要努力生产，夏收后就可以过得好。工商界代表认为缺乏资金、成品滞销及经营不善是目前工商业的主要困难，并决心努力改造自己，自力更生，克服困难。军管会代表陈穆以解放以来上海公私营行庄对工商业贷款的实际情况，说明政府对资金问题的解决尽了很大的努力。只要工商界共同努力，改善生产机构和经营方法，就能维持生产。关于工业品销路问题，华东工业部部长汪道涵以具体事例说明：政府已通过定货方式，陆续给华东各地私营工厂相当数量的生产任务；同时，政府正主动地降低煤价、电费、运费，以减轻工业品成本。但若干私营企业本身的改革是很重要的问题。经过热烈讨论后，代表们取得了一致的认识。
  关切救济失业工人组织劳资协商会议
    关于救济失业工人，各界代表均予以极大注视与关切。对上海总工会为照顾工人阶级和整个国家的长远利益，主动地忍痛提出有条件地考虑留职停薪的办法，各界代表十分感动，一致热烈拥护救济失业工人。开会期间，在业职工广泛发动了救济失业工人的捐献运动，并到若干工厂进行急救。部队代表表示：愿在困难情形下，发动全体指战员捐献一天伙食费，以救济失业工人。工商界代表认为：对为维持生产停薪留职员工暂行救济办法，必须从积极方面来认识，如有人认为有了疏散办法，可以随便停工歇业，则将辜负了当局的一片苦心。工商界代表同时向大会保证：对于救济失业工人，工商界一定能负起主要责任来。
    关于上海私营企业组织劳资协商会议提案，工人与工商界一致认为这是进一步改善劳资关系的重要步骤。工人代表沈涵指出：自二月六日蒋美轰炸后，上海遭遇严重的困难，劳资关系表面看来很紧张，但仔细研究，工人是主动地向资方作了更大的让步，如一般的工资打折扣，降低伙食，甚至忍受资方欠薪，只求把生产维持下来，生产效率也逐步提高。个别有采取过火做法的，但在总工会领导下已迅速获得解决。若干资方遇到困难即避而不见或一走了之，也是不对的。通过这次讨论，表现了绝大部分工商界是能够守住岗位，要把劳资关系弄好，要把生产搞好的。
  工商界一致表示要完成公债纳税
    对公债税收任务，代表们一致愿以最大的努力去完成。工商界表示一定在困难中想尽一切办法担负起来，并一致同意营业税征税方法由自报实缴改为民主评议，保证完成纳税人的义务；但希望力求做到公平合理，一方面为了完成税收任务，另一方面必须更好照顾各业实际营业情形。
    会议最后一天，华东军政委员会饶漱石主席出席讲话。他指出：上海解放一年来，由于上海市人民政府的正确领导及各界人民的努力，已取得伟大成绩。他着重说明了由于共产党不怕困难，终于使中国革命取得伟大胜利的经验。饶主席的讲话更进一步地加强了代表们克服困难的信心。接着，陈毅市长在总结发言中指出：这次大会的伟大成就为今后克服困难打下了强固的政治基础。他号召代表回去后贯彻大会精神，广泛开展批评与自我批评。陈市长强调指出：这是克服困难的一个重要步骤。
    会议共收到提案三十七件，建议四件，经大会一致通过的有：“上海市第三届各界人民代表会议对上海市工作任务的决议”、“庆贺第四野战军在海南岛胜利登陆的通电”、“关于营业税由自报实缴改为民主评议决定”、“上海市私营企业劳资协商会议组织通则”、“上海市为维持生产停薪留职员工暂行救济办法”及“建立上海市失业工人救济委员会”等建议经大会通过后交市协商委员会负责办理。其他提案由主席团整理后，提交市协商委员会交有关当局采纳。会议改选了上海市协商委员会，增加委员十七人。
