Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th—Approximately 5,000 honorable veterans in Northeast China are actively engaged in agricultural and small-scale industrial production. Their agricultural production task for this year is to reclaim 100,000 mu of wasteland and sow 70,000 mu, with an estimated grain yield of 11 million jin. The goal for industrial and sideline production is to achieve a profit of 87 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Veterans' farms in various locations have already commenced operations. In Songjiang Province, fertilization and seed selection work at various veterans' farms have been completed and plowing and sowing are about to begin. The Heli Veterans' Farm is actively engaged in construction work in conjunction with spring plowing. The Yilah and Dongping Veterans' Farms in Heilongjiang Province are respectively engaged in agricultural and livestock production; the Yilah Farm plans to sow 21,500 mu this year, and wheat sowing has already begun.

To ensure the completion of production plans, the state will provide the farms with a certain amount of funds to increase the purchase of horses. This year, all farms will uniformly switch to new-style farm implements and purchase mechanical farm implements, which will be allocated to major farms on a priority basis. All items produced by the farms, in addition to each member receiving the fruits and bonuses according to the value of their labor, will be entirely owned by the farm to expand production and accumulate wealth, so as to achieve complete self-sufficiency within one or two years, and gradually realize the plan of honorable new villages (collective farms). In terms of industry, it has been decided to concentrate and unify scattered small factories, strengthen leadership, and implement enterprise-based, democratic management.

　　东北五千荣誉军人
    准备开荒十万亩
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】东北荣誉军人约五千人正积极进行农业和小型工业的生产。他们今年农业生产的任务是开荒十万亩，播种七万亩，预计可产粮食一千一百万斤；工业及副业生产要完成盈利八百七十亿元（东北币，下同）的目标。各地荣军农场现已展开工作。松江省各荣军农场施肥及选种工作早已完毕，即将开犁播种。鹤立荣军农场正结合春耕积极进行修建工作。黑龙江省伊拉哈及东屏两地荣军农场，分别进行农业及牧畜生产；伊拉哈农场今年计划播种二万一千五百亩，现已开始种麦。
    为保证完成生产计划，国家将以一定数量的资金给予各农场增购马匹。各农场今年将一律改用新式农具，并购买机械农具，有重点地分配给各大农场使用。各农场生产的物品，除每一成员按劳动所值取得果实及奖金外，其余全归农场用以扩大生产，积累财富，以达到一、二年内完全自给，逐渐实现荣誉新村（集体农场）的计划。在工业方面，决定将分散的小型工厂予以集中统一，加强领导，实行企业化、民主化的经营管理。
