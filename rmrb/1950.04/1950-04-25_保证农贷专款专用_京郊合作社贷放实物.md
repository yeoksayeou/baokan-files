To Ensure Agricultural Loans Are Used For Their Intended Purpose
Cooperatives in the Suburbs of Beijing Provide Loans in Kind

[Reported by this newspaper] To ensure that agricultural loans are used for their intended purpose, various districts in the suburbs of Beijing have adopted the method of providing loans in kind through cooperatives. The loan process is jointly managed by the village government and the farmers' association, mobilizing the masses for discussion and determining loan recipients based on their needs, with some cases being reviewed by district work teams. After the loans are approved, the cooperatives purchase the actual goods and deliver them to the borrowing households. The goods loaned include autumn seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, and the like. The Thirteenth District Cooperative has ordered 350 large hoes and 500 hoes from blacksmith shops for agricultural tool loans, most of which have now been completed and delivered to the borrowing households. The style of the farm tools is made according to the different needs of the farmers. For example, the large hoes used by farmers in Shiliuzhuang are half a kilogram heavier than usual, so they are made according to their opinions. Many village cooperatives buy sweet potato seedlings from the potato mother for sweet potato seedling loans, and ask skilled people to raise seedlings to supply to the borrowing households. The price of sweet potato seedlings obtained by farmers in Balizhuang Village, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Districts, from the cooperative is 30% lower than the market price. The Thirteenth District's Dongba Town received a total of 130,000 jin of fertilizer loans, and the cooperative purchased an extra 10,000 jin of fertilizer through unified purchasing. The Madao Village Cooperative in the Fourteenth District and the village cadres unified the purchase of materials for well-digging loans for the entire village and organized the village's well-digging technicians to contract the work in a unified manner, saving labor and money. The loans originally intended for sixteen wells can now be used to dig twenty wells. This organized approach of providing loans in kind through cooperatives and village-level leadership is seen by the farmers as a practical and convenient way to solve problems and avoid the past shortcomings of some people misusing the loans. At the same time, the cooperative's business can be better integrated with mass production.

　　保证农贷专款专用
    京郊合作社贷放实物
    【本报讯】京郊各区在向农民贷款时为了作到专款专用，采取了通过合作社贷放实物的办法。贷款的进行是由村政权、农会共同负责掌握，发动群众讨论，根据需要确定贷款对象，有的并经区工作组进行审查。贷款领出后，由合作社购置实物交贷款户。贷出之实物有大秋籽种、农具、肥料等。十三区合作社将农具贷款统一在铁匠炉订制大镐三百五十把、锄五百个，现大部分已打好，交给贷款户。农具的式样是根据农民不同的需要制作的。如石榴庄农民使用的大镐比一般重一斤半，便根据他们的意见打制。很多村合作社将白薯秧贷款买上薯母子，请有技术的人养成秧子供给贷款户。十三四区八里庄村农民从合作社得到的白薯秧子价格比市上低百分之三十。十三区东坝镇共领肥料贷款十三万斤，经合作社统一购买，就多买了一万斤肥料。十四区马道村合作社和村干部将全村打井贷款统一购买物料，并将全村打井技术人员组织起来，统一包打，省工又省钱。原十六眼井的贷款能打井二十眼。这样有组织的通过合作社及村级领导贷放实物，农民都觉得能实际解决问题，又方便；并可避免过去某些人拿到贷款随便乱用的缺点。同时，合作社业务也能更好的和群众生产相结合。
