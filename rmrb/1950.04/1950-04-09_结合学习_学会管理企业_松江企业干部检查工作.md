　　Integrating Study of "Learn to Manage Enterprises"
    Songjiang Enterprise Cadres Inspect Work
    [Report from Our Correspondent Lü Yingcai] Special Correspondent Lü Yingcai reported: In the second half of March, working cadres of state-owned enterprises in various parts of Songjiang Province universally studied the editorial in this newspaper, "Learn to Manage Enterprises," and combined the spirit of the documents to inspect their actual work. According to reports from cadres of state-owned enterprises in Fujin, Shangzhi, Ning'an, Linkou, Acheng and other places, the inspection was conducted in conjunction with study. It reflects that some enterprises have achieved preliminary results in implementing democratic management. For example, since the Fujin County Electricity Bureau implemented democratic management, workers have engaged in production with a sense of ownership, reducing coal consumption per kilowatt-hour by 22 percent; at the same time, they overcame material difficulties, made substitutes, and repaired the No. 2 generator, which was deemed irreparable during the puppet Manchukuo era. The Shangzhi County Electric Lamp Factory, after research by the factory management committee, improved fuel handling work, saving more than 60 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below). However, there are still many shortcomings in the management work of various enterprises, which are being studied and improved. The management committees of many factories exist in name only. For example, in the Fujin Dexiangdong Flour Mill, major production events are not discussed and studied by the management committee, and the factory director makes decisions, so that everyone does not speak at meetings of the management committee, workers disagree with each other, and machine failures are not repaired. For example, the Linkou County Iron Factory did not accept workers' suggestions and lost 25 million yuan in purchasing raw materials. Many enterprises' production management is in a state of unplannedness. For example, the Fujin Deshundong Oil Mill uses workers without specific responsibilities, drawing them temporarily everywhere, regardless of their technical proficiency, resulting in a drop from more than 10,000 jin of oil per day in the past to no more than 8,000 jin now. The Limin Iron Factory has no advance plan for purchasing raw materials, and the wood for making large carts changes shape after the finished product is made; this year, it did not conduct in-depth investigations into market prices when purchasing raw materials, losing more than 100 million yuan in total. The winery in Ning'an County does not reward workers for exceeding the quota, nor does it properly deal with those who fail to meet the quota, resulting in fluctuations in wine production and losses in production. Other issues include irrational wage systems and relatively weak leadership and education from the Party and the trade union. After learning and inspecting, the administrative, Party, and trade union leaders of enterprises in various places have begun to correct these shortcomings. Administratively, they are responsible for improving the organization, strengthening the system, listening to workers' opinions, and running the factory management committee well. The trade union will strengthen worker education, improve production, and train grassroots cadres. The CCP Fujin County Committee has also assigned a cadre to specialize in the work of the factory branch to strengthen leadership and make each factory branch the core of production.

### 结合学习“学会管理企业”  松江企业干部检查工作

　　结合学习“学会管理企业”
    松江企业干部检查工作
    【本报讯】特约通讯员吕英才报导：松江省各地公营企业工作干部，在三月份下半月普遍学习了本报社论“学会管理企业”，并结合文件精神，检查了实际工作。据富锦、尚志、宁安、林口、阿城等地公营企业干部结合学习、进行检查。反映出：各企业在实行管理民主化工作中，有的已收到了初步成绩。例如：富锦县电业局自实行管理民主化后，工人们以主人翁的态度来从事生产，使每度电的耗煤量降低了百分之二十二；同时克服器材困难，做出了代用品，并把伪满时认为不能修理的二号发电机修好了。尚志县电灯厂经过工厂管理委员会的研究，改进燃料处理工作，节省了开支六千余万元（东北券，下同）。但各企业管理工作中的缺点仍很多，正在研究改进。许多工厂的管理委员会徒有形式。例如：富锦德祥东火磨厂，生产上重大事件不通过管委会研究讨论，厂长就作了决定，以致管委会开会时大家都不发言，工人之间闹意见，机器上出了毛病也不收拾。又如：林口县铁工厂不接受工人建议，在购买原料上损失两千五百万元。许多企业的生产管理上存在无计划状态。例如：富锦德顺东油房，使用工人无专责，临时到处抽，不管技术是否熟练，结果过去每天出油一万多斤，现在最多不能超过八千斤。利民铁工厂买原料事先无计划，作大车的木料做出成品后走了样子；今年购原料时不深入调查市场价格，共赔了一亿多元。宁安县的制酒厂，工人生产超过定额的无奖励，不及定额的也无适当处理，结果使出酒量忽高忽低，造成了生产上的损失。其他如工资制度还存在不合理的现象，党与工会领导与教育相当薄弱。经学习与检查后，各地企业的行政、党与工会的领导干部已开始纠正这些缺点。由行政上负责健全组织，加强制度，听取工人意见，办好工厂管委会。工会则加强工人教育，搞好生产，并训练基层干部。中共支部则加强党内教育，展开批评与自我批评，发动党员保证完成任务。中共富锦县委并抽出一名干部专作工厂支部的工作，以加强领导，使各厂支部成为生产的核心。
