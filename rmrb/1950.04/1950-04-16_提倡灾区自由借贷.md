　　Advocating Free Lending in Disaster Areas
    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has recently issued instructions advocating the widespread and correct development of free lending in disaster areas. This is not only an important way to help disaster victims survive the famine, but also a way to solve the problem of production capital for some disaster victims. This is because not every household in the disaster area lacks surplus grain, especially in the new areas, where there are more households with surplus grain than in the old areas. Therefore, local free lending is more timely and convenient than transferring grain from outside areas for adjustment.
    At present, in some areas where work has been done well, and upright wealthy people have been absorbed into the production and disaster relief committees, correct lending relationships have begun to emerge. In Daqing District, Pingmin County, Shaanxi, cadres at all levels vigorously publicized correct lending policies in organizing sideline production, eliminating the masses' concerns about lending; in the production and disaster relief committee, honest and wealthy households were absorbed, with seventy-eight households lending a total of 8,150 jin of peanuts, 150 jin of cotton, and 14 shi of grains and beans, solving the funding difficulties of 119 households. Farmers in Lintong County also lent each other 302 shi of wheat. Furthermore, in Daming County, Hebei Province, credit organizations have been established in various villages. Under the influence of Communist Party members and village cadres taking the lead in lending surplus grain, a total of 1.2 million jin of grain were lent out in non-disaster areas throughout the county, which, with the help of the government, were systematically lent to farmers in disaster areas. Shandong and Pingyuan counties, which were also affected by the disaster, also put forward the call for free lending and achieved certain results.
    However, in the process of lending for disaster relief, some areas have also experienced deviations such as forced lending, hard lending, and searching for lending. These deviations, as the instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs say, "are extremely harmful to the development of lending relations and are also detrimental to disaster relief work." For example, a few cadres in some counties and districts in Hebei and Pingyuan mistakenly believed that as long as the interests of the middle peasants were firmly not infringed upon, it would be okay to ignore the masses' forced borrowing from landlords and rich peasants, which caused the surplus grain households to worry, and even led to the burying of grain and escape. Such erroneous thinking and the tendency of forced lending should be corrected in a timely manner.
    We hope that all disaster-stricken areas can implement the instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Regarding Promoting Lending Work in Rural Disaster Areas," promote correct free lending, rectify lending policies, and strive to overcome the spring famine and the difficulties of spring plowing for farmers in disaster areas.

### 提倡灾区自由借贷

　　提倡灾区自由借贷
    中央人民政府内务部顷发布指示，提倡在灾区广泛而正确地开展自由借贷。这不但是帮助灾民渡荒的一项重要办法，而且这个办法还能够解决一部分灾民生产资本的困难。因为灾区中并非户户均无余粮，特别是在新区，余粮户较老区为多。因此，就地自由借贷，比之由外区运粮调剂，更为及时便利。
    目前部分地区因为工作作得较好，在生产救灾委员会中又吸收了正派的富有者参加，正确的借贷关系已经开始出现。陕西平民县大庆区，在组织副业生产中，各级干部大力宣传正确的借贷政策，消除了群众对于借贷的顾虑；在生产救灾委员会中，吸收殷实富户参加，有七十八户共借出花生八千一百五十斤，棉花一百五十斤，谷豆等十四石，解决了一百一十九户的资金困难。临潼县农民间亦互相借贷了小麦三百零二石。又如河北省大名县，各村都建立了信贷组织，在中共党员、村干部带头出贷余粮的影响下，全县非灾区共贷出粮食一百二十万斤，经政府的帮助，有计划地贷给灾区农民。山东、平原受灾各县也都提出了自由借贷的号召，获得了一定成绩。
    但在借贷救灾过程中，也有某些地区发生了强借、硬借、搜借等偏向。这些偏向，正如内务部指示所说，“对于发展借贷关系是有极大妨害的，对救灾工作也是不利的”。如河北、平原有些县、区的少数干部，错误地认为只要坚定地不侵犯中农利益，即便群众对地主、富农强借亦可不问，因此引起余粮户的顾虑，甚至发生埋藏粮食及逃避等现象。这种错误的思想与强迫借贷的偏向亟应及时予以纠正。
    我们希望灾区各地能贯彻内务部“关于灾区农村提倡借贷工作”的指示，提倡正确的自由借贷，端正借贷政策，为战胜春荒，克服灾区农民春耕的困难而努力。
