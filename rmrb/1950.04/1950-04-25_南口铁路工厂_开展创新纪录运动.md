　　Nankou Railway Factory
    Launches Innovation Record Movement
    [Our Dispatch] The Nankou Railway Factory, under the Zhangjiakou Railway Administration Sub-bureau, officially launched an innovation record movement on the 11th of this month. As early as January of this year, the factory began preparations for the innovation record movement. First, the sub-bureau dispatched personnel to form a working group with the factory to be responsible for assessing working hours. By March, most of the work had been standardized. On March 28th, under the leadership of the factory's Management Committee, an Innovation Record Committee was established. In early April, concentrated publicity and mobilization efforts were carried out. In addition to using the spare-time school for publicity, various meetings were held with veteran workers, young workers, model worker activists, team leaders, and production officers. Trade union groups also cooperated in discussions. Wall posters, slogans, dramas, movies, and other media were used to focus on publicizing the innovation record movement, and the workers' enthusiasm gradually increased. At the official Innovation Record Movement Conference on the 11th, representatives from various units put forward methods and specific plans for creating new records and pledged to do their utmost to support other relevant units, signing cooperation contracts with each other and striving to exceed the completion of tasks. Foundry worker Bao Xianwei said: "We improve our working methods and implement a two-shift system, which can ensure that the monthly iron smelting volume is increased to 160 tons, and the copper smelting volume is increased to 35 to 40 tons (i.e., doubled compared to the past)." Boiler shop veteran worker Li Yutian said: "We will create new records by shortening the repair time of boilers. We will better adopt Soviet advanced working methods and implement 'assembly line operations.' We aim to repair large boilers with Nos. T6 and 1586 in 8.5 days (similar boilers used to take about 15 days), and we guarantee no water leakage."

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the factory's innovation record movement, the Railway Bureau has sent a working group of more than 20 people to assist in the work and has decided to reward the factory with ten thousand catties of rice.

　　南口铁路工厂
    开展创新纪录运动
    【本报讯】张家口铁路管理分局所属南口铁路工厂，于本月十一日正式开展创新纪录运动。远在今年一月份，该厂即开始了创新纪录运动的准备工作。首由分局派员与厂方共同组成工作组，负责查定工时。至三月间，大部工作均已作出标准。三月二十八日，在该厂管委会领导之下，成立了创造新纪录委员会。四月上旬集中进行宣传动员：除通过业余学校进行宣传外，又分别召开老工友、青工、劳模积极分子、小组长及生产干事等各种会议，工会小组也同时配合讨论。壁报、标语、话剧、电影等均集中宣传创新纪录运动，工人们的情绪逐步上涨。十一日，正式举行创新纪录运动大会时，各单位代表纷纷提出创新纪录的方法和具体计划，并保证尽全力支持其他有关单位，互相订好联系合同，争取超过完成任务。铸工所工友鲍贤伟说：我们改进工作方法，施行两班制，可保证每月把化铁量提高到一六○吨，化铜量提高到三五至四○吨（即较过去提高一倍。）锅炉所老工友李雨田说：我们以缩短锅炉的修理日期来创造新纪录，更好地采用苏联先进的工作方法实行“流水作业”，大修炉以攵Ｔ六及一五八六号的八点五天为目标（过去同类的炉要十五天左右），并且保证不漏滴水。
    为加强对该厂创新纪录运动的领导，铁路局已派二十多人的工作组前往协助工作，并决定以万斤米作为奖励。
