Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Due to the correct implementation of the bandit suppression policy of "military剿 (suppression), political disintegration, and mobilization of the masses," significant achievements have been made in bandit suppression work in Southwest, Central South, Fujian, Qinghai, and other regions.
  Southwest
    The Southwest Military Region wiped out more than 51,000 bandits in March alone. In the bandit suppression work, all units generally achieved active suppression, relentless pursuit, and prevented bandits from having any chance to catch their breath. Zhao Jinhua, the battalion commander of a certain unit in eastern Sichuan, led two companies of soldiers, disregarding the fatigue of long-distance raids, and continuously pursued a group of bandits for half a month until all hundreds of bandits were annihilated. Southern and Western Sichuan have also created examples of bandit suppression operations in which bandits were completely annihilated and our army suffered no casualties. At present, except for individual areas in Guizhou, eastern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan where bandits are still rampant, the remnants of bandits in most other areas of the Southwest region have been forced to shift from open and concentrated activities to scattered and concealed activities.
  Central South
    In March, the Central South Military Region eliminated most of the First and Second Detachments of the Guinan People's National Salvation Army, parts of the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Provisional Divisions of western Hunan, and a part of other bandit gangs and scattered bandits, totaling 34,450 people. Among them, bandit leaders such as Chen Zhangnan, deputy commander-in-chief and detachment leader of the Guinan People's National Salvation Army, and Liu Zhenguan, commander of the Ninth Route Army of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area, were killed or captured. Those who surrendered included Zhao Bi, Tang Jiyi, commander of the northern Guibei Anti-Communist Guerrilla Column, and Tan Yingfu, commander of the Badong Guerrilla Column, and 6,200 officers and soldiers under their command; 334 bandits accepted reorganization.
  Fujian
    From September of last year to February of this year, the Fujian Military Region troops annihilated a total of 21,337 bandits. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Fujian in August of last year, there were approximately 40,000 remaining bandits in the province, in more than 130 large and small gangs. After vigorous suppression by the military sub-district troops and the bandit suppression troops of the Third Field Army stationed in Fujian, and the formation of work teams to cooperate with local governments, mobilize the masses, organize farmers' associations, combine autumn tax collection, rent reduction, and anti-local tyrant movements, establish local armed forces, conduct armed self-defense, and carry out mass bandit suppression movements, large groups of bandits in various places have now been largely annihilated or defeated.
  Qinghai
    Most of the bandits in Qinghai Province have been eliminated. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Qinghai Military Region troops are vigorously suppressing the scattered bandits of Ma Chengxian, Ma Quanzhang, and others who were defeated in the Hualong area. In March, with the active support of people of all ethnic groups, a certain unit of the Qinghai Military Region annihilated more than 800 bandits in bandit suppression operations, including the capture of more than 60 bandit leaders such as Meng Quanzhan and Ma Wuju, killing or wounding more than 300 bandits, and the surrender of more than 400 bandit leaders such as Ma Zhongyi and Han Jinlu.

　　西南、中南及福建、青海
    股匪大部已被消灭
    【本报讯】综合新华社电讯：由于正确贯彻了“军事清剿、政治瓦解、发动群众”的剿匪方针，西南、中南、福建、青海等地剿匪工作都获得重大成绩。
  西南
    西南军区三月份全月歼匪达五万一千余人。在剿匪工作中，各部普遍做到积极进剿、穷追猛打，不让土匪有喘息机会。川东某部赵金华营长率两个连兵力不顾长途奔袭的疲劳，连续追击股匪达半个月之久，直到匪众数百人悉数被歼为止。川南、川西等地并创造了全歼股匪、我军无一伤亡的剿匪作战范例。现西南全区除贵州、川东、川南个别地区股匪仍属猖獗外，其余大部分地区的残匪已被迫由公开的集中的活动转入分散隐蔽的活动。
  中南
    中南军区三月份共歼匪桂南民众救国军第一、二支队大部、湘西暂七师、八师、九师各一部及其他股匪散匪一部三万四千四百五十名。其中毙俘匪桂南民众救国军副总司令兼支队队长陈章南、湘鄂赣边区反共救国军第九路军军长刘振关等匪首若干名。投降者有匪桂北反共游击纵队司令赵璧、唐继颐、巴东游击纵队司令谭英甫等以下官兵六千二百名；匪接受改编者三百三十四名。
  福建
    福建军区部队，自去年九月到今年二月，共歼灭土匪二万一千三百三十七名。去年八月人民解放军解放福建后，全省残存股匪约四万人，大小一百三十余股。经各军分区部队及第三野战军驻闽剿匪部队，进行大力清剿，并组成工作队，配合地方政府，发动群众，组织农民协会，结合秋征、减租、反恶霸运动，建立地方武装，进行武装自卫，开展群众性的清剿运动，现在各地大股土匪已被大部歼灭或击溃。
  青海
    青海全省股匪已大部被消灭，现人民解放军青海军区部队正在大力清剿化隆地区被击溃的马成贤、马全彰等部散匪。三月份青海军区某部在各族人民积极支援下，于剿匪作战中共歼土匪八百余名，内俘匪首孟全战、马午居等六十余名，毙伤匪三百余名，投降者匪首马忠义、韩进禄等以下四百余名。
