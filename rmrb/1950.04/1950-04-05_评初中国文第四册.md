　　Review of Junior High School Chinese Textbook, Volume Four
　　Gao Yuting
　　Published by Xinhua Bookstore, Second Edition, August 1949

　　I am a Chinese language teacher in a middle school. To prepare for this semester's lessons, I recently read through the fourth volume of the Junior High School Chinese textbook published by Xinhua Bookstore. Like other textbooks published by Xinhua Bookstore, this textbook pays more attention to the political and ideological content of the articles. As stated in the "Editor's Note," "In terms of content, we strive for a relatively correct stance, viewpoint, and methodology, and a relatively substantial content." Measured against this requirement, the 30 articles in the entire volume are generally acceptable. This is where Xinhua textbooks are superior to other textbooks on the market.

　　However, in terms of content alone, not every article in this volume is flawless. The ideological content of the 18th and 19th lessons, "The Female Bolshevik - Maria" originally by Nevyerov (a work shortly after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union), is not very correct, and even somewhat absurd.

　　This story is very simple. Maria, a rural woman, has a poor relationship with her husband, Bogepei (nicknamed Kezuoke). The forces of the revolution arrive, she participates in work, joins the Party, is elected as the first female member of the Farmers' Soviet, and gets divorced.

　　Let's see how the author handles this theme. First, he lightly places the key to the couple's discord on "quarrels," rather than on the unreasonable marriage system of the old society.

　　"(Bogepei), when quarreling with Maria, always banged on the table as if a blacksmith was wielding a hammer.
　　'I'm going to kill you! I'm going to chop off your head!'
　　But Maria was very slippery. Intentionally flattering him, as if afraid of him:
　　'Bogepei, what's wrong with you?'
　　'I'm going to chop off your head!'
　　She said even more diligently:
　　'The meal is cooked now. Do you want to eat?'
　　…………
　　At night, she hugged him in her arms, caressing his hair, and whispered in his ear like a cat lulling him to sleep. Kezuoke pinched her, and she smiled and said:
　　'What's wrong with you, Bogepei, it hurts to be pinched.'"

　　The author does not clearly explain what Maria is dissatisfied with her husband about.

　　The forces of the revolution arrive, and Maria leaves her family. She runs to the meeting place, winking at the speaker, inviting him to her house for tea. In order to answer Bogepei's demand for her to return home, she deliberately goes on stage to give a speech. The two scold each other in the meeting place. "From then on, Kezuoke wanted his own interests, and Maria also wanted her own interests." This is followed by a passage of erotic description. The husband wants to sleep with his wife, but the wife refuses. "Come to me!" "I've had enough of this stuff."

　　From the author's pen, we seem to see that Maria is not a true working woman, but rather a woman with some ruffian habits.

　　However, according to the author, Maria has progressed. The manifestation of her progress is that she "took some books and newspapers from the club. She spread a tablecloth on the table and sat there with her lips moving as if she were a female teacher." Then, she founded a club, attracting women one by one. According to the author, these women "wanted to live a different life." But what did they do under Maria's leadership when they gathered together? Propagate the truth of the revolution? Fight against the enemies of the revolution? Discuss how women can be liberated? Study how to step up production? None of that. We only see a Soviet committee member named Vasili arrive. He is not there to arrange work, nor to understand the lives of the masses, but only to inquire "about reading matters," and, he "is on the side of the women - their party program is like that." Below we see that this committee member really didn't do anything else, he put the work on Maria, and his "mind was also disturbed." Once, they were sitting side by side in the house, hugging each other, saying "I love you very much," but Bogepei stuck his head out from under the bed, and they laughed and said, "We know you're sitting under the bed."

　　It was this Maria who "completely wanted to join the Bolsheviks." She not only joined the Party, but also, when the Soviet was reorganized, was elected as a member of the Farmers' Soviet. After becoming a member, we didn't see her work, but we saw her official air:

　　"There was a table there, with an inkwell on it. There were two pencils, one blue and one red. The secretary was sitting next to her, drafting documents. Her voice also changed. Sitting and looking at the documents.
　　'This is about the food supply problem, Comrade Yelif?'
　　She even looked at the documents like an official: 'Are the documents prepared? Prepare them quickly!'"

　　We also saw that she got divorced, and many women also got divorced under her influence.

　　Regarding Maria's ending, the author said in the first person: "We all thought that this person was difficult to get rid of no matter what, but a small thing happened, and the counter-revolutionary Cossacks attacked, and Maria went to the car with the Bolsheviks and fled." This confused me. Is the author sympathizing with Maria, or opposing her?

　　The shortcomings of this volume are not limited to this article alone. In terms of material selection, the editors seem to have simply emphasized the political and ideological content of the articles, ignoring the level of acceptance of junior high school second-year students aged fourteen or fifteen. There are many articles that are good in meaning, but students, limited by their age, life experience, and knowledge level, cannot easily accept. For example, a passage excerpted from Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," entitled "Individual and Collective," discusses things that are by no means understood by underage junior high school students, such as:

　　"This kind of selfish individualism is also often manifested in unprincipled disputes, factional struggles, and sectarianism and departmentalism within the Party, and in actions that disrespect and arbitrarily destroy the Party's discipline. Unprincipled struggles mostly start from private interests, and factional struggles and sectarianism often put the interests of individuals or a few people above the interests of the Party." And such as:

　　"However, when his purpose cannot be achieved, when he is hit and treated coldly by comrades in the Party, he may be in danger of wavering. In the history of the Party, many people have wavered and left the Party because of this."

　　Such rich and profound content, even I, as a teacher, cannot fully understand and appreciate it. When I read these places, I ask myself, how do I explain it to students? How do I turn these concise words into nutrients that young students can digest? To be honest, my political level and understanding of the Communist Party cannot enable me to complete this task.

　　The same is true in "Marx at Work":

　　"If a person's value is calculated according to the work he has done - just as the value of things is calculated according to the amount of labor they contain - then Marx's value is so high that only a few giants in the intellectual world can be on par with him.’
　　"‘Science’ has no market value. And how can we expect bourgeois society to pay a large price for that ‘death sentence that proclaims its own execution’?"

　　I have not read much of Marx's works, and I don't understand the meaning of these two paragraphs at all. Then how can I teach students? How can students understand?

　　In addition, the thoughts and lives expressed in "The Necklace," "Norman Bethune Fragment," and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" are also beyond the understanding and comprehension of children.

　　Like the third volume, this volume also selects several classical Chinese articles. Whether classical Chinese should be added in the second year of junior high school is not discussed here for the time being. Only the standard of selecting classical Chinese articles is worth discussing. Among the four classical Chinese articles selected in this volume, one is a long narrative poem - "Ballad of Mulan," two are works from before the Qin and Han dynasties - "Zou Ji Advises King Qi to Accept Criticism" and "Yan Zi's Mission to Chu," and only one is an article by a modern person - "A Record of Viewing Paintings in Paris." Why not select shorter and simpler verses? Why not select some modern prose that is close to vernacular Chinese? Judging from the current cultural level of junior high school students, teaching these articles is a lot of work with little effect. During teaching, it is not easy to compare the use of words and sentences with vernacular Chinese, and without this comparison, it is difficult to understand the similarities and differences between classical Chinese and vernacular, that is to say, it is difficult to understand the rules of classical Chinese.

　　Some references and annotations should also be revised and supplemented. For example, regarding Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, only "Hunanese, one of the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" is noted; regarding Comrade Zhang Hao, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China who has passed away, not a single word is noted. In the notes to "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," using "not losing elegance, nor losing roughness" to annotate "Wen Zhi Binbin" (refined), and using "ancient people used to describe the virtues of scholars" to annotate "Wen Liang Gong Jian Rang" (gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, and yielding), are both difficult to grasp. In many annotations, some clichés are still used, lacking a clear class stance and analysis and explanation. For example, in the notes to "Daming Lake," regarding Tie Xuan, the following sentences are copied: "Official Shandong Participation. When Yan Wang Zhu Di raised troops to fight for the throne, Xuan… repeatedly defeated the Yan Wang army, and was promoted to Minister of War. When Yan Wang entered the capital, he refused to die by dismemberment." In the notes to "The Necklace," regarding Maupassant, it only says "Modern French novelist, especially good at writing short stories." This only tells students a bit of dead knowledge. In the notes to "Ballad of Mulan," regarding the Blackwater, it says "Now it is no longer available for examination. (Some) say that there is Blackwater in Wen County, Gansu." Regarding Yanshan, it says "In the southeast of Ji County, Hebei. Some say it is the Hangai Mountains of Mongolia." One in Gansu, one in Hebei, makes the text even more difficult to understand.

　　The proofreading work of this volume is also quite rough. I used the Complete Works of Lu Xun to proofread Mr. Lu Xun's "Illiterate Writer." In an article of about a thousand words, I found six or seven errors in words and punctuation, such as the comma in the middle of "It is a pity that there is no way to write it down, and there is no way to write it down" in the sixth line of the main text being mistaken for a period, "'Anti-breeding Anti-breeding School'" being mistaken for "'Anti-breeding Anti-breeding' School'" in the eighth line, "many" being mistaken for "some" in the fifteenth line, "Midnight Song and Reading Song" being mistaken for "Midnight Song, and Reading Song" in the eighteenth line, the second "leave behind" being mistaken for "spread" in the twentieth line, "occasionally" being mistaken for "occasionally" in the twenty-fifth line, and "surprised" being mistaken for "a surprise."

　　There are indeed many errors and shortcomings in this book, but I still use it as the Chinese language textbook for the second semester of the second year this year, because I know that among similar textbooks, political and ideological errors are more common than it, and the writing is not necessarily more reliable. But I have a wish, hoping that after the summer vacation, more satisfactory language teaching materials in terms of content and writing can be compiled.

　　Note: Mr. Gao's article was sent by us to the Editorial and Review Bureau of the General Administration of Publications, and after checking it against the original book, the Bureau's opinion was that Mr. Gao's criticism was good. We hope that schools and teachers using this book as a textbook will delete "The Female Bolshevik - Maria," because this novel is in any case not suitable as a textbook. Regarding the other points pointed out by Mr. Gao, we also hope that teachers will make appropriate corrections. Shortcomings and errors similar to those criticized by Mr. Gao also exist in other volumes of junior and senior high school Chinese textbooks published by Xinhua Bookstore. We hope that teachers and students using this textbook can point them out as enthusiastically and seriously as Mr. Gao, so that Xinhua Bookstore can correct them.

　　评初中国文第四册
    高玉亭
    新华书店出版  一九四九年八月再版本
    我是个中等学校的国文教员，为了准备本学期的课，最近把新华书店出版的初中国文第四册翻了一遍。这一册课本，同新华书店出版的其他课本一样，比较注意文章的政治思想内容，如“编者的话”中所说：“在内容方面，力求立场、观点、思想方法比较正确，内容比较充实。”全册三十篇文章，以这个要求来衡量，大体还可以。这正是新华课本优于坊间其他课本的地方。
    但是，单就内容来说，这一册中的文章也不见得篇篇无可指摘。第十八、十九课涅维洛夫原作的《女布尔雪维克——玛丽亚》（这是苏联十月革命后不久的作品），思想内容就不怎么正确，甚至有些荒谬。
    这一篇故事很简单。农村妇女玛丽亚同她丈夫卜哥裴（绰号珂左克）感情不好，革命的力量到来了，她参加了工作，入了党，被选为农民苏维埃第一任女委员，离了婚。
    我们看作者怎样处理这个主题吧。首先，他把夫妇不合的关键轻轻的放在“闹气”上，不放在旧社会的不合理的婚姻制度上。
    “（卜哥裴）同玛丽亚闹气的时候，总是敲着桌子好象铁匠抡铁锤似的。
    ‘我要杀你！要宰你的头！’
    可是玛丽亚很滑头。故意的抬举他，仿佛怕他似的：
    ‘卜哥裴，你怎么呢？’
    ‘我要宰你的头！’
    她更殷勤的说：
    ‘饭我现在煮好了。你要吃吗？’
    …………
    夜里把他抱到怀里抚摩着他的头发，附在他耳朵上呜呜的仿佛猫一般的催眠着。珂左克拧她一下，她微笑着说：
    ‘你怎么呢，卜哥裴，拧的痛的很。’”
    玛丽亚究竟在什么地方不满意她丈夫呢？作者没有交代清楚。
    革命的力量到来了，玛丽亚走出了家庭。跑到会场里，在演讲员跟前挤眉弄眼的邀他到家里去喝茶。为了回答卜哥裴强制她回家的要求，故意的登上演说台去演说。两个人在会场里对骂了一番。“从此以后珂左克要自己的利害，玛丽亚也要自己的利害了。”接着是一段色情的描写。丈夫要跟妻子睡觉，妻子不答应。“到我跟前来！”“这个玩艺儿我够了。”
    从作者的笔下，我们仿佛看到玛丽亚并不是一个真正的劳动妇女，倒像一个带些二流子习气的女人。
    然而照作者说，玛丽亚进步了，她的进步的表现是“由俱乐部拿些书报回去了。把桌子铺起桌布，坐到那里仿佛女教员一般的嘴唇在动着。”接着，她又创办了俱乐部，把女人们一个个的吸引过来。按照作者的话说，这些女人是“想过别样的生活”的。但是她们聚集起来在玛丽亚领导之下做了些什么呢？宣传革命的道理吗？向革命敌人作斗争吗？讨论妇女如何才能得到解放吗？研究如何加紧生产吗？都没有。我们只看见一位名叫华西里的苏维埃委员来了，他不是为布置工作来的，也不是为了解群众的生活来的，只是来询问“关于阅书的事”，而且，他“是站在女人方面的——他们的党纲是如此的。”以下我们看到这位委员确实没有做别的事，他把工作放在玛丽亚身上，“心思也紊乱了。”有一次，他们肩并肩的在房子里坐着，拥抱着，说着“我很爱你”，卜哥裴却从床下探出头来，他们就笑着说：“我们知道你在床底下坐着呢。”
    就是这个玛丽亚，却“完全想加入布尔雪维克”了。他不只加入了党，而且在改造苏维埃的时候，被选为农民苏维埃的委员。当了委员以后，我们没有看见她的工作，却看见了她的官气：
    “那儿摆着桌子，上面摆着墨水壶。放着两枝铅笔，一枝蓝的，一枝红的。书记在旁边坐着，草着文件。她的声音也变了。坐着看着文件。
    ‘这是关于给养问题的吧，叶里夫同志？’
    居然官长一般的又看着文件：‘文件预备好了吗？快把它预备起来！’”
    我们还看见她离了婚，而且许多女人也在她的影响之下离了婚。
    对于玛丽亚的结局，作者以第一人称的口气说：“我们都想着无论如何这个人是难得除去的，可是恰好有点小事发生了，反革命的哥萨克攻来了，玛丽亚就同布尔雪维克坐到车上逃去了。”这一下却把我闹糊涂了，作者到底是同情玛丽亚呢，还是反对玛丽亚呢？
    这一册的缺点还不单在这一篇文章上。在选材上，编者似乎单纯的着重了文章的政治思想内容，忽略了十四五岁的初中二年级学生能够接受的程度。有许多文章，在意义上是很好的，可是学生们受了年龄、生活经验、知识水准的限制，不容易接受。如从刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》中节选了一段，标题为“个人与集体”，其中所讲的东西，决非未成年的初中学生所能体会的，如：
    “这种自私自利的个人主义，也常常表现在党内的无原则纠纷、派别斗争及宗派主义与本位主义的错误中，表现在对于党的纪律性的不尊重与随意破坏的行动中。无原则斗争，大部分是从私人利益出发，派别斗争与宗派主义常常把个人或少数人的利益摆在党的利益之上。”又如：
    “然而，在他这种目的不能达到之时，他受到打击和党内同志冷淡的待遇之时，他就可能有动摇的危险。在党的历史上由于这样而动摇出党的人已经不少。”
    这样丰富深刻的内容，就连我这个教员也不能完全了解，充分体会。读到这些地方，我就问自己，我怎样向学生解释呢？我怎样把这些简括的语言化为少年学生所能消化的营养料呢？老实说，我的政治水平与对共产党的认识都不能使我完成这个任务。
    在“工作中的马克思”中，也有同样的情况：
    “如果一个人的价值是按照他所作过的工作来计算——好像事物的价值是按照它所包含的劳动数量来计算一样——那么，马克思的价值也是如此之高，知识界的巨人恐怕只有很少几个能与他并驾齐驱的。’
    “‘科学’是没有市场价值的。而我们又怎能希望资产阶级社会给那‘宣告自己死刑的判决书’支付一笔很大的价钱呢？”
    我没有多读马克思的著作，这两段话的涵义我就根本搞不清楚。那又怎样去教学生呢？学生又怎样能懂得呢？
    此外如《项链》《诺尔曼·白求恩断片》及《湖南农民运动考察报告》中所表现的思想与生活，也都不是孩子们所能了解体会的。
    同第三册一样，这一册也选了几篇文言文。文言文应不应在初中二年级增添，这里姑且不谈。只就选文言文的标准上来看，也是值得讨论的。这一册中所选的四篇文言文中，一篇是长篇叙事诗——木兰诗，两篇是秦汉以前的作品——邹忌讽齐王纳谏及晏子使楚，只有一篇是近代人的文章——观巴黎油画记。韵文，为什么不选点短些的、浅些的？散文，为什么不选些近代人的，接近语体文的？就现在初中学生的文化水平来说，教这几篇文章都是费力多而收效少的。教学的时候，不容易在用词造句上拿来跟语体文作比较，而不作这种比较，就很难了解文言与语体的异同，也就是说，很难了解文言文的规律。
    若干参考与注释也应该修订与补充。如关于中央人民政府副主席刘少奇同志，只注了个“湖南人，中共中央委员之一”；关于已经逝世了的中共中央委员张浩同志，连一个字也没有注。在《湖南农民运动考察报告》的注中，用“不失之文弱，又不失之粗野”来注“文质彬彬”，用“古人形容读书人的美德”来注“温良恭俭让”，都未免叫人难于捉摸。在不少注释中，更沿用了一些陈词滥调，缺乏明确的阶级立场与分析说明。如在《大明湖》的注中，关于铁铉，抄了以下的几句：“官山东参政。燕王朱棣举兵争君位，铉…屡败燕王军，迁兵部尚书。及燕王入都，不屈磔死。”在《项链》的注中，关于莫泊桑，只说“近代法国小说家，尤擅于写短篇小说。”这只告诉了学生一点死知识。在《木兰诗》的注中，关于黑水，说“今已无考。（有的）说在甘肃文县有黑水。”关于燕山，说“在河北蓟县东南。有的说是蒙古之杭爱山。”一在甘肃，一在河北，使得本文更难于理解。
    这一册的校勘工作也相当粗疏。我用鲁迅全集把鲁迅先生的“不识字的作家”校对了一下，千来字的篇幅，就发现了六七处文字及标点的错误，如正文第六行“可惜没有法子记下，也没有法子记下”中间的逗点误成句点，第八行“‘抗育抗育派’”误成“‘抗育抗育’派”，第十五行“好许多”误成“有许多”，第十八行“子夜歌和读曲歌”误成“子夜歌，和读曲歌”，第二十行第二个“留传”误成“流传”，第二十五行“偶有”误成”偶而有”，“吃惊”误成“吃一惊”。
    这本书的错误和缺点固然很多，但是我仍然采用它作为今年二年级下学期的国文教材，因为我知道，在同类的教材中，政治思想上的错误都比它多，而且有的文字上也不见得更靠得住。可是我有一个愿望，希望在暑假以后能有在内容与文字上都比较使人满意的语文教材编出来。
    按：高先生这篇文章曾经由我们送给出版总署编审局，对照原书检查了一遍，编审局的意见认为高先生的批评是好的。我们希望采用这本书做教材的学校和教师，将《女布尔雪维克——玛丽亚》删掉，因为这篇小说无论如何是不适宜于当作教材的。关于高先生所指出的其他各点，我们也希望教师们加以适当的改正。类似高先生所批评的缺点和错误，新华书店出版的其他各册高初中国文课本中多多少少也是有的。我们希望采用这部教材的教师和学生，能像高先生这样热心与认真给指出来，好让新华书店去改正。
