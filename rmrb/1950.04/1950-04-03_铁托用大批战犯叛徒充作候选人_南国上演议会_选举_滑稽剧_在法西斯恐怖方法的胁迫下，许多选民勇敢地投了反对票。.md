　　Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: The so-called "elections" for members of the People's Assembly were held in Yugoslavia, governed by the Tito clique, on March 26th. According to Agence France-Presse, the total number of members of the new assembly is 620, 99 more than the previous assembly. The assembly was expanded on the basis that the Tito clique restored the civil and political rights of tens of thousands of war criminals, collaborators, and fascists, and revised the election law to allow these people to be nominated as candidates. The Polish People's Tribune revealed that in the entire list of candidates, 61 percent were ministers, ambassadors, and mayors of the Tito government, 10 percent were high-ranking officers in the army and Ranković secret service, 11 percent were union and Tito's "Party" dignitaries, and only 7 percent of the candidates were workers and 6 percent were peasants.

　　On election day, the Tito clique mobilized more than 600,000 police and secret agents, using fascist terror methods to coerce people to vote. According to a TASS report on the "election" situation: Soldiers, students, and residents of Belgrade lined up to vote on the 26th. Each voter received prior notice of when and where to vote. If they could not go with the group on time, they had to report to the election committee and obtain approval. These facts vividly illustrate the compulsory nature of the election. At the polling stations, voters did not use ballots but used election balls to put into ballot boxes either in favor of or against Tito's candidates. Voting took place in crowded small rooms and under the supervision of election committee members. Under this fascist terror, the Tito clique and its manipulated "People's Front" obtained the necessary majority in the election. Nevertheless, many people bravely cast negative votes.

　　铁托用大批战犯叛徒充作候选人
    南国上演议会“选举”滑稽剧
    在法西斯恐怖方法的胁迫下，许多选民勇敢地投了反对票。
    【新华社二日讯】铁托集团当政的南斯拉夫于三月二十六日举行了所谓人民议会议员的“选举”。据法新社消息：新议会议员的总数为六二○人，比上届议会多了九十九人。议会是在这样的基础上扩大的，即：铁托集团恢复了数万战争罪犯、通敌分子与法西斯分子的公民权和政治权，并修改了选举法，以使这些人得以被提名为候选人。在整个候选人名单中，据波兰人民论坛报揭露，有百分之六十一是铁托政府的部长、大使、和市长们，有百分之十是军队和兰科维奇特务机关中的高级军官，百分之十一是工会和铁托的“党”的权贵，只有百分之七的候选人是工人和百分之六是农民。
    在选举日，铁托集团动员了六十万以上的警察特务，用法西斯的恐怖方法胁迫人民去投票。据塔斯社报道“选举”情形称：贝尔格莱德的军人、学生和居民，在二十六日都列队前去投票，每个选民事先都接到在何时何地投票的通知，如不能按时随队前去，须先报告选举委员会并获得批准。这些事实生动地说明了选举的强迫性质。在投票站，选民不是用选票而是用选举球投入赞成或是反对铁托候选人的票箱中。投票是在人众拥挤的小室中和在选举委员的监视下进行的。在这种法西斯的恐怖下，铁托集团及其操纵下的“人民阵线”就在选举中得到了必要的多数票。虽然如此，许多人仍勇敢地投了反对票。（附图片）
