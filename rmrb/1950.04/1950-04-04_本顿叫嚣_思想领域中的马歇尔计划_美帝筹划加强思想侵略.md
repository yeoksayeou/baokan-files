Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Simultaneously with stepping up military and economic aggression abroad, American imperialist elements are actively planning to strengthen ideological aggression. According to a Washington dispatch from the United States Information Service, former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, now Democratic Senator Benton, submitted a bill to the Senate on March 22nd, co-signed by ten other senators, proposing the adoption of a "Marshall Plan in the realm of thought." In his speech, Benton expressed alarm at the "ideological gap" between the people of the world and American imperialists, and exclaimed that the United States is now at a "critical juncture of struggle." Therefore, he believes it is necessary to "have a Marshall Plan in the realm of thought" to expand deceptive propaganda in order to "bridge" this gap.

In his six specific recommendations, in addition to calling for the use of the United Nations and American diplomatic missions to carry out activities in this area, he also advocated "developing the activities of the State Department's Office of Public Affairs and the Educational Exchange Service." Specific measures include: implementing a "comprehensive global plan" for screening American films, "expanding the program of absorbing foreign students to study in the United States," and "establishing a world broadcasting network capable of broadcasting long, medium, and short waves." In addition, Benton also called for promoting so-called "democratic education" abroad, "especially in the occupied areas of Germany and Japan." The "democratic education" in Benton's mouth is obviously the revanchist and fascist education that the American occupiers are currently implementing in Japan and West Germany.

Benton finally suggested convening a conference of "non-communist countries" to implement an "international news program" and encouraging the establishment of a "non-governmental organization" to assist in further poisoning the work of "millions of ordinary people" in the United States.

### 本顿叫嚣“思想领域中的马歇尔计划”  美帝筹划加强思想侵略

　　本顿叫嚣“思想领域中的马歇尔计划”
    美帝筹划加强思想侵略
    【新华社三日讯】与加紧对外军事与经济侵略同时，美帝国主义分子并积极筹划加强思想侵略。据美国新闻处华盛顿讯，美前负责公共事务助理国务卿，现任民主党参议员本顿，于三月二十二日向参院提出了一个有其他十个参议员连署的议案，建议通过一个“思想领域中的马歇尔计划”。本顿在演说中对世界人民与美帝国主义者之间的“思想上的鸿沟”表示惊恐，惊呼美国现在已处在“斗争的紧急关头”。因此，他认为必须“来一个思想领域中的马歇尔计划”，扩大欺骗宣传，以“弥补”这种鸿沟。
    本顿在其六点具体建议中，除了要求利用联合国及美国外交机关进行这方面的活动外，还主张“发展国务院中国务新闻司与教育交换司的活动”，具体办法是：实行一个放映美国电影的“全世界范围的综合计划”，“扩大吸收外国学生留美的计划”及“建立能广播长、中、短波的世界广播网”。此外，本顿还要求促进所谓国外的“民主教育”，“特别是在德、日占领区”。本顿口中的“民主教育”，显然就是美国占领者目前在日本与西德所正实行的复仇主义与法西斯主义教育。
    本顿最后建议召开一个实行“国际新闻计划”的“非共产主义国家”的会议，并鼓励成立一个“非政府机构”，以协助进一步毒化美国“千百万平民”的工作。
