　　Effective Organization for Improving Production and Labor-Management Relations in Private Enterprises
    Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Tianjin Private Factories
    The labor-management consultation meetings established in several private factories in Tianjin have proven to be an effective organization for promptly improving production and labor-management relations in private enterprises.

    As of the end of March, the private enterprises in Tianjin that had established labor-management consultation meetings included Dongya Enterprise Company, Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng textile mills, Renli Woolen Company, Yongli Chemical Company, Great Wall Rubber Factory, Xincheng and Zhongxing Paper Mills, and Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, among others, totaling more than ten units.

    Before the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in Tianjin's private factories, although production had recovered and workers' lives had improved compared to before liberation, many problems still existed in production. For example, waste was serious, production had not yet reached the level of the Japanese occupation period, staff were generally not responsible enough, and workers' labor efficiency had not reached the desired level. At the same time, workers also lacked appropriate opportunities to promptly raise their opinions on production or welfare to the capitalists for consultation and resolution. In late November of last year, the organization of the labor-management consultation meeting was first established in Dongya Enterprise Company. Through this organization, the company successively resolved more than 50 opinions raised by workers, thereby increasing production compared to before. Subsequently, Hengyuan, Renli, Beiyang, Yongli, Dasheng, and other private enterprises also established labor-management consultation meetings one after another.

    The organization of the Tianjin labor-management consultation meeting generally consists of an equal number of fixed representatives (four to five people) from both labor and management, who meet once a week. The meeting mainly discusses issues related to production, labor insurance, and worker welfare, which are resolved after an agreement is reached by both parties. If problems cannot be resolved, if it is due to inconsistencies in practices, they can be discussed and studied separately again; if it involves the interests of both parties and opinions differ greatly after repeated attempts to reach an agreement, the matter can be submitted to the Labor Bureau for mediation and arbitration. As for the decision-making power in business operations, administrative management, and personnel appointments and transfers, it still belongs to the capitalists, and the trade union has the right to advise and protest.

    Generally, capitalists had concerns about establishing labor-management consultation meetings at the beginning. They were mainly afraid that the trade union would interfere with administrative power, that it would be difficult to cope with workers raising too many or too high demands, and that production might not necessarily benefit, etc. On the trade union side, in the beginning, individual factory trade union cadres hoped to resolve all past outstanding issues in the labor-management consultation meeting, and some even insisted on interfering with the capitalists' administrative power, demanding that the capitalists replace certain staff, to the point where the capitalist of one factory did not attend the meeting for six consecutive times, and the factory director also took leave for "recuperation."

    The experience of various factories proves that the work of the labor-management consultation meeting will only achieve results if both labor and management adhere to the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, working together to solve difficulties, and gradually resolving workers' welfare demands from the development of production. For example, workers in the cloth workshop of Hengyuan Textile Mill could originally only watch four to six looms. The factory wanted to change it to eight looms per person, but it did not succeed for more than a month. Later, after discussions between representatives of both labor and management at the consultation meeting, and with the proactive help of the trade union, everyone was able to watch eight looms within a week. At the same time, the labor-management consultation meeting also solved some welfare problems, such as abolishing body searches, repairing toilets, and hiring additional nurses. To ensure the implementation of the resolutions, the workshop负责人of the factory trade union and administration organized workshop production meetings to solve daily problems occurring in the workshop. The joint efforts of labor and management in Beiyang Textile Mill to improve production also increased the average yarn output per spindle per 20 hours from 0.69 pounds to 0.799 pounds, and reduced the return cotton of steel wire from 400 pounds to 200 pounds; at the same time, it also made the labor-management consultation meeting smoother and more successful in resolving issues related to the interests of both labor and management. The factory also organized planning, inspection, and hygiene groups to implement the resolutions of the labor-management consultation meeting. The factory's workshop director holds regular meetings with the trade union every day to promptly resolve daily trivial problems, so that the labor-management consultation meeting can concentrate its energy and time on discussing the most important issues related to the factory's overall production and worker welfare.

### 改进私营企业生产和劳资关系的有效组织  天津私营工厂的劳资协商会议

　　改进私营企业生产和劳资关系的有效组织
    天津私营工厂的劳资协商会议
    天津市若干私营工厂建立的劳资协商会议，已被证明是及时地改善私营企业的生产和劳资关系的一种有效组织。
    截至三月底的材料，天津私营企业已建立劳资协商会议的有东亚企业公司、恒源、北洋、达生等纱厂，仁立毛呢公司，永利化学公司，长城橡胶厂，信诚、中兴造纸厂，美亚绸织厂等十余单位。
    天津私营工厂在建立劳资协商会议以前，虽然生产已经恢复，工人生活较解放前已有改善，但生产中存在的问题仍然很多，如浪费现象严重，生产量尚未达到日寇统治时期的水平，职员一般不够负责，工人劳动效率也未达到应有的高度等；同时，工人对生产或福利的若干意见也没有适当机会及时向资方提出协商解决。去年十一月下旬，劳资协商会议的组织首先在东亚企业公司成立。该公司通过这一组织，先后解决了工人提出的五十多条意见，生产因而较前提高。此后恒源、仁立、北洋、永利、达生等私营企业也即相继成立了劳资协商会议。
    津市劳资协商会议的组织，一般由劳资双方各派相等数目（四人到五人）的固定代表组成，每周集会一次。会议主要讨论有关生产、劳动保险、工人福利等方面的问题，由双方取得协议后加以解决。遇有不能解决的问题，如果是由于做法上不一致，可再次分别讨论研究；如果涉及双方利害，且意见悬殊多次不得协议，可提请劳动局调解仲裁。至于在业务经营、行政管理、人事任用调动方面的决定权力则仍属资方，工会有建议权和抗议权。
    一般资本家对于成立劳资协商会议开始时是有顾虑的。他们主要是怕工会干涉行政权，怕工人提出过多、过高的要求时不好应付，而对生产反不一定会有好处等。在工会方面，开始时有个别工厂的工会干部希望在劳资协商会中解决过去的一切悬案，有的甚至坚持干涉资方的行政权，要求资方撤换某些职员，以至有一个厂的资方连续六次不参加会议，厂长也请假“养病”。
    各厂的经验证明，只有劳资双方本发展生产、劳资两利的原则，共同努力解决困难，从发展生产中逐渐解决工人福利要求的情况下，劳资协商会议的工作才会取得成绩。如恒源纱厂布场工人原来只能看四台到六台布机，厂方想改为每人看八台，但搞了一个多月没有成功，以后经过劳资双方代表在协商会议上的商量，由于工会的主动帮助，不到一周即全部做到每人看八台布机。同时劳资协商会议也解决了部分福利问题，如废除搜身制、修理厕所、增聘护士等。为保证决议的执行，该厂工会及行政的车间负责人组织了车间生产会议，解决车间日常发生的问题。北洋纱厂劳资共同努力改善生产的结果，也使每锭二十小时从平均出纱○点六九磅提高到○点七九九磅，钢丝的回棉也由四百磅降低至二百磅；同时也使劳资协商会议在解决有关劳资双方利益问题上较为顺利和成功。该厂还组织了计划、检查和卫生等组来贯彻执行劳资协商会议的决议。该厂工务主任每天和工会开碰头会，及时解决日常琐碎问题，使劳资协商会议能集中精力、时间，讨论有关全厂性生产和工人福利中最主要的问题。
