Representatives from All Circles in Taigu, Shanxi Reflect Public Opinion: Urgently Requesting Strengthened Rural Public Security

    Suggesting the Government Stabilize Social Order to Benefit Production

    [Our Newspaper] At the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Taigu County, Shanxi, representatives unanimously believed that improving rural social order and strengthening public security work are pressing issues that the masses urgently need to resolve in the process of restoring and developing production. According to representatives, the problems that existed in the county in the past were: (1) Drug use and trafficking, as well as robbery and theft, were relatively common. According to the Public Security Bureau's statistics for January and February, a total of 27 theft cases occurred (6 solved), and 15 drug use and trafficking cases (11 solved). (2) A small number of militiamen did not abide by discipline, and incidents of indiscriminate shooting, gambling, and fighting occurred, affecting social order. (3) Dispersed officers and soldiers (400 in the county) and returning personnel (more than 4,000 in the county) were not completely and appropriately resettled and managed. For example, a scattered soldier in Xiaobai Village came during the day and left at night, acting irregularly and attracting young people to gamble. (4) Hidden enemies used feudal and backward secret societies to spread rumors and stir up trouble, undermining the masses' enthusiasm for production. During the meeting, representatives from farmers, merchants, education, and other circles criticized the local government, believing that they had not paid attention to these matters in the past, which hindered the masses' production. They also conducted detailed discussions on this and provided many valuable opinions. Li Maosheng, a farmer representative from the first district, said: "Relying solely on the government to maintain public security is the old society's approach. Now we must enlighten and educate the masses and make public security work a mass movement to do it well." An education representative said: "It is necessary to strengthen propaganda and education to raise the masses' awareness in order to expose rumors and supervise bad people." Finally, the meeting passed five resolutions to improve public security work: (1) Dispersed officers and soldiers and returning personnel should be promptly resettled properly. For villages where land reform has already been completed, they can rent land from widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless elderly, or help them find a way to make a living based on their specific circumstances. Those who have the ability to return to their original residences should be mobilized to do so as much as possible. (2) It was decided to pilot training classes for drug users in the eighth district to strengthen ideological education and eliminate their bad habits. After gaining experience, it will be extended to other districts. Drug traffickers will be severely punished by the government if caught. (3) In addition to publicly prohibiting gambling, offenders will be educated or appropriately punished according to the severity of their offense. Special attention should be paid to educating cadres to refrain from gambling. (4) The militia should be mobilized to strengthen inspections to prevent theft incidents from happening again. (5) Secret societies should be declared illegal, and the masses should be educated and explained to. After the masses have a certain level of understanding and awareness, they should be strictly banned. The representatives solemnly suggested that the People's Government adopt and implement the above five resolutions, demanding that the government greatly strengthen public security work, because the masses urgently need a good social order to carry out production.

　　山西太谷各界代表反映群众意见  迫切要求加强农村治安
    建议政府安定社会秩序以利生产
    【本报讯】山西太谷县各界代表，在第二次各界人民代表会议上，一致认为：改进农村社会秩序，加强治安工作，是目前群众在恢复发展生产中，迫切要求解决的问题。据代表们反映，该县过去存在的问题是：（一）吸贩毒品与抢窃偷盗案较为普遍，一、二月份公安局统计，共发生偷盗案二十七件（破获六件），吸贩毒品案十五件（破获十一件）。（二）少数民兵不遵守纪律，发生随便打枪，赌博打架等恶劣行为，影响社会秩序。（三）对流散官兵（全县四百人）及还乡人员（全县四千余），未完全适当安置与进行必要管理。例如小白村一个流散军人，白日来，夜即去，行动不规，并拉拢青年赌博。（四）暗藏敌人、利用封建落后的会道门，造谣生事、破坏群众生产情绪。会间，农民、商人、教育等各界代表，都对当地政府进行了批评，认为过去不注意这些事情，妨碍了群众生产。并就此作了详尽讨论，提供了不少宝贵意见。一区农民代表李茂生说：“治安工作单靠政府维持，是旧社会的作法。现在我们要启发教育群众，把治安工作变成群众性的，才能做好。”一位教育代表说：“必须要加强宣传教育，提高群众觉悟，才能揭破谣言和监督坏人。”最后，会议通过五项改进治安工作的决议：（一）对流散官兵与还乡人员，要迅速想法妥为安置。如土地改革已经结束的村庄，可租种鳏寡孤独的土地，或根据其具体情况，帮助找生活出路，有能力回原籍者，尽可能动员他们回去。（二）决定在八区试办吸毒品者的训练班，加强思想教育，杜绝其恶习。获得经验后，再推广至其他区。对贩毒者，经政府查获，即予重处。（三）赌博问题，除公开禁止外，犯者分别轻重，给予教育或适当处分。特别注意教育干部，不得赌博。（四）小偷窃盗问题，发动民兵加强检查，以免再发生此类事件。（五）应宣布会道门为非法，并向群众教育解释，在群众有一定的认识觉悟后，则应严加取缔。以上五项决议，代表们郑重建议人民政府采择执行，要求政府对治安工作大力加强，因为群众迫切要求一个良好的社会秩序，以便进行生产。（李贵成）
