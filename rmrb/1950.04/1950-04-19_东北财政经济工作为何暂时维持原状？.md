　　Why Does the Financial and Economic Work of Northeast China Temporarily Remain Unchanged?

To the Editor:

When we studied the People's Daily editorial "Why Unify National Financial and Economic Work," we didn't understand the ending of the fourth paragraph: "In order for the Northeast Administrative Region to better support the entire country financially and economically, the Central People's Government has decided that the currency of Northeast China will temporarily maintain its current status, and only adopt the method of allocating materials to Northeast China in terms of finance." Why would this better support the entire country?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sun Zhijun

Comrade Sun Zhijun:

The Central People's Government's decision that the currency of Northeast China will temporarily maintain its current status, and only adopt the method of allocating materials to Northeast China in terms of finance, is primarily because Northeast China was liberated earlier than the areas inside the Pass (关内, i.e., the rest of China), and the Northeast currency was stabilized earlier than the Renminbi. This is an extremely important condition for the economic recovery and development of Northeast China. In 1949, the financial, monetary, and production construction work in Northeast China had already embarked on the right track. In particular, because Northeast China's industrial production accounts for a large proportion of the country and has begun to realize planned economic construction work, it is necessary for the Central Government to decide that the currency of Northeast China will temporarily maintain its current status, in order to facilitate the rapid recovery and development of Northeast China's economic construction. Secondly, because Northeast China has established a relatively complete and independent system in terms of financial management, it is beneficial to the whole of China to temporarily not connect the financial and fiscal system of Northeast China with the areas inside the Pass, so that the region's financial work can fully perform its functions in supporting economic construction. The Northeast China financial budget, like the financial budget of the areas inside the Pass, must also be approved by the Central People's Government. After the Northeast financial budget is approved and implemented by the Central Government, except for the stipulated task of remittance, it will temporarily not report revenue and expenditure to the Central Government. The task of remittance of Northeast China finance to the Central Government is to solve the Central Government's need to regulate the supply of grain and materials in various regions. The temporary method of allocating materials is adopted to solve the supply of materials and grain in the areas inside the Pass, and at the same time, it can give the Northeast financial management an appropriate scope of flexibility to facilitate the needs of economic construction work in the region. In short, the Central People's Government decided that the currency of Northeast China would temporarily maintain its current status, and only adopt the method of allocating materials to Northeast China in terms of finance, with the aim of accelerating the recovery and development of economic construction in Northeast China, so that the region can better support the entire country financially and economically. This is also beneficial and necessary in terms of the national policy of focusing on economic recovery. But does this mean that Northeast China is not included in the unified national economic scope? No, first of all, the various financial and economic policies and regulations are unified throughout the country. Secondly, the financial revenue and expenditure budget of Northeast China must be reviewed and approved by the Central People's Government for implementation. Other major financial and economic measures in the region, such as production investment plans and the amount of currency issued, must also be approved by the Central Government before they can be implemented. Therefore, the financial and economic work of Northeast China is basically unified with the areas inside the Pass, and is an inseparable part of the national financial and economic work.

### 东北财政经济工作为何暂时维持原状？

　　东北财政经济工作为何暂时维持原状？编辑同志：
    我们在学习人民日报社论“为什么要统一国家财政经济工作”时，对该文第四段结尾“为使东北行政区能更好地在财政经济上支援全国起见，中央人民政府决定东北的货币暂时维持现状，在财政上对东北也暂时只采取抽调物资的办法。”我们不了解为什么这样会更好地支援全国？
                                                    孙志均孙志均同志：
    中央人民政府决定东北的货币暂时维持现状，在财政上对东北也暂时只采取抽调物资的办法，原因首先在于东北解放较关内为早，东北币比人民币先稳定，这对于东北经济的恢复与发展是一个极端重要的条件。一九四九年东北的财政金融与生产建设工作已经走上正轨，特别是因为东北的工业生产，在全国占有较大比重，且已开始实现有计划的经济建设工作。为使东北经济建设工作获得迅速的恢复与发展，中央决定东北的货币暂时维持现状，是十分必要的。其次，由于东北在财政管理上，已建立了一套比较完善的单行制度，为了使该区财政工作在支持经济建设上能充分发挥其职能，暂时不使东北金融与财政体系，不与关内连结在一起，对于全中国是有利的。东北财政预算与关内财政预算一样也是要经过中央人民政府批准的，东北财政预算经中央批准执行后，除规定上解任务外，暂时不向中央办理收支解报制度。东北财政应向中央上解的任务，是为了解决中央调节各区粮食物资需要，暂时采取抽调物资的办法，这样解决了关内物资粮食供给，同时可以使东北财政管理取得适当的机动范围，便利该区经济建设工作的需要。总之，中央人民政府决定东北的货币暂时维持原状，在财政上对东北暂时只采取抽调物资的办法，目的就在于加速东北经济建设的恢复与发展，使该区能够更好地在财政经济上支援全国。就全国重点恢复经济的政策来说，也是有利的与必要的。但因此是不是东北就不包括在统一国家经济范围以内了呢？不是的，首先是各种财政经济政策法令是全国统一的。其次，东北的财政收支预算须经过中央人民政府审核批准执行，该区其他重大的财经措施，如生产投资计划，货币发行数量等等，也是要经过中央核定后才能执行。所以东北财经工作基本上还是与关内统一的，是全国财经工作不可分离的一部分。
