On the afternoon of April 17th, around 1:00 PM, Squad Leader Ding Xizhen from the cooperative of a certain unit stationed in Cang County, along with two large carts, passed east of the water tower at Cang County Station. Road maintenance workers Liang Qingxuan and Wang Bozong went to explain the road protection rules for post-rain vehicle passage. However, they used the excuse of urgent grain transportation for the supply of the troops, claiming that "the higher authorities have not issued instructions or orders prohibiting driving on the road after rain," and disregarded the rules. Road maintenance workers Liang Qingxuan and others, in order to resolutely implement government decrees, went in front of the carts to block their path and reasoned with them again. Then, three people jumped off the carts, cursed and beat Liang Qingxuan, pushing him aside and breaking his right middle finger, allowing the carts to pass. After the carts left, Comrade Ding Xizhen led two other comrades to the highway management office, made inquiries with a tough attitude, and declared that not only would they pass this time, but they would continue to do so in the future. Regarding this incident of assault, we have now filed a complaint with the government court. We believe that although these matters are individual problems within the troops, if they are not resolved, they will not only hinder the implementation of road protection work, but will also affect the reputation of the People's Army among the masses. In the future, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring and to implement government decrees, in addition to requesting the direct superiors of the troops to handle this matter, we also hope to attract the attention of relevant departments.

　　丁西珍等蛮不讲理
    破坏护路规则动手打人
    有关方面应该迅速查究
    四月十七日下午一时许，驻沧县某部合作社丁西珍班长带着两辆大车经过沧县车站水楼子东，管理所护路员梁庆轩王伯宗两同志便前往对他们反复说明雨后停车的护路规则。但他们却借口供应部队运粮紧要，声称“上级没有雨后不轧公路指示及命令”，而置之不理。护路员梁庆轩等为了坚决执行政府法令，便到车前拦住他们的去路，再行讲理。而他们竟由车上跳下三人，将梁庆轩连骂带打推到一边，并把他的右手中指打破，让大车开走。车去后，丁西珍同志又带领了两个同志来到公路管理所，以强硬态度进行查询，并声言不但这次要走，以后必还要走。对于这一动手打人的事件，我们现在已向政府法院提出控诉。我们认为这些事情虽然是部队中个别人的问题，但如不解决，则不但足以妨碍护路工作的执行，且会影响人民军队在群众中的声誉。今后为了防止类似事件的发生及贯彻政府法令，我们除请该部队直属上级处理外，并希能引起有关部门注意。
