　　Review of Several Dictionaries
　　Chang Feng, Wang Cheng

　　I. A Dictionary of New Knowledge (Bei Xin Book Company)
　　II. A Dictionary of New Knowledge, Continued (Bei Xin Book Company)
　　III. A Dictionary of New Terms (Chun Ming Bookstore)

　　To meet the needs of the broad readership, many dictionaries with the label "New" have appeared on the market. However, most of these dictionaries cannot be trusted by readers. The few mentioned here may not be the worst of their kind, but the errors they contain are too numerous to list individually. Here, we can only discuss a few key points.

　　Among these three dictionaries, the Bei Xin's "A Dictionary of New Knowledge" most clearly demonstrates an irresponsible attitude towards readers. This dictionary published an "Enlarged and Revised First Edition" in April 1948 and a "Corrected Sixth Edition" in September 1949. However, the so-called "correction" was clearly not a serious and thorough revision. Therefore, it not only retains many outdated and inappropriate materials, but also contains intolerable absurdities in the latest corrected edition. For example: In the entry for "Wedemeyer," it says: "Before leaving China, he issued a statement sternly criticizing the Chinese government for rectification and reform, otherwise, it would not be able to defeat the Communists." The entry for "Interrogation Law" quotes the so-called "Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution during the Kuomintang's Tutelage Period" and adds the explanation: "This is a law guaranteeing the basic freedoms of the people." The entry for "May Student Movement" (referring to the student movement in the Beijing-Shanghai area in 1947) states: "Upon hearing this, the government announced the 'Emergency Handling Law,' and it was calmed down after suppression." Shouldn't such entries be "corrected"? Also, the entry for "Xi'an Incident" states: "Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng staged a military remonstrance in Xi'an against Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission... Chiang wrote a book, 'Xi'an Fortnightly Diary,' recounting the events." The entry for "Four Promises" states: "The four promises announced by Chairman Chiang at the Political Consultative Conference." Even at the time of "correction," the editors did not feel it necessary to point out that the descriptions of the "Chairman" and "Chairman of the Commission" and the promises were all a big lie! Furthermore, the entry for "Northern Expedition" states: "Chiang Kai-shek served as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, and with the support of the people, successively captured Hunan, recovered Wuhan, Nanjing, and the Yellow River basin, unifying the country." Such a muddled understanding of history should at least be "corrected." When Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Nanjing and the Yellow River basin during the "Northern Expedition," he had already openly become a counter-revolutionary. Do the dictionary editors still want to pretend they don't know?

　　This is to say that this Bei Xin dictionary prominently displays the blind "orthodox" concept fostered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

　　At the same time, this dictionary irresponsibly conveys the lies of the American and British bourgeoisie to readers. It earnestly introduces that "Red Fascism" is "a term given to the American Communist Party by American anti-communists"; "In countries that practice New Democracy, towns where Communist Party members account for a majority of the councilors are called Little Moscow"; "Revolutionary governments that adopted red terror policies in history include... the Russian Soviet government after the October Revolution"; "Recently, anti-Soviet elements in various countries have also referred to the dictatorship of the working class in the Soviet Union as totalitarian politics"; "Reuters is the most authoritative news agency in the world," and so on.

　　This dictionary is completely incapable of analyzing and criticizing the erroneous viewpoints of the bourgeoisie. For example, when it proposes the entry "Political Democracy and Economic Democracy," it makes a lot of chaotic and mediocre explanations, concluding: "In today's world, countries with political democracy refer to capitalist democratic countries, and countries with economic democracy refer to socialist democratic countries; the former is represented by the United States, and the latter by the Soviet Union." When it explains "one-party dictatorship," it says: "This form of rule can be applied under different political principles, such as the Bolshevik Party in the socialist Soviet Union, the National Socialist Party in fascist Germany, and the Kuomintang in China before the War of Resistance." In fact, a high degree of economic democracy must be combined with a high degree of political democracy. The so-called political democracy and economic democracy were originally distinctions created by the bourgeoisie to confuse the public. Although socialist countries have only one political party, it forms a close alliance with the broad masses of working people, which is essentially different from the one-party dictatorship of fascism. These erroneous concepts have long deceived many people. If a new dictionary cannot correct these errors but continues to spread them, what is the value of this "new" dictionary?

　　Even the most common noun, "society," is defined in this dictionary as "Society is the largest system of human cooperation..." The explanation of "human nature" is "A universal nature unique to human beings, such as sympathy, compassion, joy, anger, etc..." It's true that it would have been better if you hadn't explained it, because once you explain it, it just confuses people.

　　Relatively speaking, Bei Xin's "A Dictionary of New Knowledge, Continued" (first edition in early January 1950) and Chun Ming's "A Dictionary of New Terms" (reprinted in October 1949) are slightly better, but still retain some errors of the same nature. In Bei Xin's continuation, when explaining "freedom," it says that in capitalist countries, the meaning of freedom refers to the people's right to freedom of speech, publication, and election of parliament, and in socialist countries, it refers to the people's right to food, clothing, work, education, etc. This is still the same old tune of distinguishing between political democracy and economic democracy. Chun Ming's book confirms in the entry "one-party dictatorship" that the Soviet Union is also a one-party dictatorship. Although it attempts to explain that this is different from the one-party dictatorship in capitalist countries, it still falls into this confused concept because it does not understand that the dictatorship of the proletariat is not equal to the dictatorship of the Communist Party.

　　Because the explanations in dictionaries are definitional, they must be complete and thorough, otherwise, they will become seemingly correct or completely wrong. For example, Bei Xin's continuation explains "socialism in one country," roughly saying that because it is impossible to launch a world revolution, it is possible for one country to build socialism first. This does not touch on the real reason why building socialism in one country became possible in the era of imperialism. When the same book explains "racial theory," although it criticizes this "theory" of imperialists, it concludes, "Imperialist aggression and colonization are not a racial problem, but actually a national problem." This is still not correct, because although imperialist aggression always uses the name of national problems, it is actually only for the interests of the reactionary bourgeoisie's aggressive expansion. Furthermore, the definitions of various classes in Chun Ming's book are also mostly incorrect or incomplete. For example, it says: "Semi-proletariat" is "Although they do not have the means of production and live by selling their labor, they are still not proletarianized in their consciousness." This statement gives the wrong impression that the division of classes is based on the state of people's thinking and consciousness. In the "Women's Issues" section of the same book, it says, "Women's issues are a product of feudal society and can only be partially resolved in capitalist society..." This is also wrong. Women's issues are also a product of capitalist society. Capitalism cannot solve any women's issues, but only replaces feudal patriarchal oppression with monetary oppression.

　　When it comes to the national policies of New Democracy, dictionary compilers should not adopt a hasty and self-righteous attitude. There are many such errors in these dictionaries. For example, Chun Ming's book has the entries "New Political Consultative Conference and Old Political Consultative Conference" and "Old Political Consultative Conference Line" (this entry also appears word for word in Bei Xin's continuation), which contain inappropriate explanations. Chun Ming's book also has an entry for "Liquidation Struggle," which states that mass rallies should be held during land reform, "At the meeting, the masses will announce the crimes of anti-traitors (?) and local tyrants one by one. Those who exploited must be compensated, and those who killed must pay with their lives." This description is wrong and harmful. Bei Xin's continuation has an entry for "Understanding Reasoning First," which is said to be "a policy of social education in the Liberated Areas." This is simply baseless nonsense!

　　Since dictionaries are written for Chinese people now, readers naturally have the right to demand that the writers not just copy ready-made texts but must make necessary connections with the current situation in China. Although this request may seem a bit high, it cannot but be made. Both Bei Xin's continuation and Chun Ming's book have an entry for "wages," and they consistently assert that wages are nothing more than a product of the capitalist exploitation system of workers. If the writers seriously thought about it, there is another fundamentally different kind of wage in the New Democratic society and socialist society, and they themselves should feel that the explanations they put forward are incomplete and sufficient to lead readers to erroneous ideas.

　　The errors pointed out above are certainly related to the theoretical and political level of the writers, but if the writers had a more responsible spirit and a more thoughtful and research-oriented spirit, they would have looked at more relevant reference books when writing each entry. Then, many of these errors would not all be unavoidable.

　　II

　　Judging from these few dictionaries, if the compiler of a dictionary adopts a vulgar objectivist attitude, he can never do his job well. That is to say, he should not be an unprincipled copyist, writing down whatever he hears, as if he could be completely irresponsible for what he writes. That is to say, he should not adopt a "recording everything heard" attitude like a vulgar bourgeois journalist.

　　Of course, we cannot say that these few dictionaries generally express this objectivist attitude, but it can also be seen from the errors listed above that they have not yet been able to break free from this attitude.

　　Even if what is written is indeed a fact, it may still not be an appropriate explanation. Bei Xin's continuation introduces Anthony Eden, who once served as the British Foreign Secretary, by saying, "He is the most meticulous man, and the French call him the best-dressed Englishman..." This may be a fact, but what is the purpose of using dictionary space to write about such material favored by American-style tabloids? Both Bei Xin's continuation and Chun Ming's book especially tell us that the American oil tycoon Rockefeller is charitable and "donated funds for the discovery of Peking Man and Peking Union Medical College in our country." Is this to illustrate that the Chinese people should be grateful to this American monopoly capitalist? Chun Ming's book says in the entry "Cardinal": "The total number of cardinals in the world is only a few dozen, and there is also one in China after the victory." Is stating this "fact" to prove the international glory won by China's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan?

　　Take the entry "Nine-Power Treaty" as an example. Bei Xin's book explains: "...mainly based on the principles of guaranteeing China's territorial integrity, equal opportunities for all countries in China, and the open door policy. This was the United States' means of dealing with Japan, but since the September 18th Incident, the so-called Nine-Power Treaty has been destroyed without any remainder." What impression does this explanation give people? The Nine-Power Treaty was the United States' way of dealing with Japan and was beneficial to China, but it was a pity that it was destroyed by the Japanese invasion. Chun Ming's book also says that the Nine-Power Treaty "aimed to guarantee China's sovereignty, independence, and the integrity of its administrative territory, and to ensure that the powers would assist China in maintaining a stable government. However, Japan tore up the Nine-Power Treaty after the September 18th Incident." Both of these writers only narrate the original text of the Nine-Power Treaty and some superficial phenomena, without further analysis, pointing out that the essence of the Nine-Power Treaty is an elaborate set of shackles for the imperialist powers to jointly manage China. The antagonism between the United States and Japan is not the important essence here. What is important is the relationship between imperialism and China. Although a dictionary can only give a simple explanation, it must appropriately make such an essential analysis in order to provide readers with truly useful knowledge. Otherwise, merely satisfying oneself with a superficial "objective" narrative would become helping imperialism deceive the Chinese people.

　　It is very clear that a dictionary should not merely "introduce" an erroneous concept or proposition without making any criticism. Bei Xin's book proposes the entry "Supra-class" and only explains it by saying, "Not affiliated with any class, transcending any class, is called supra-class." The continuation explains "cooperativism" by saying: "Advocating that everyone implements production, consumption, or distribution on the basis of common interests and equality. Cooperativists hope to eliminate the evils of capitalism and individualistic economics through cooperatives and cooperative movements." In such seemingly good entries, the effect is actually to promote erroneous ideas. A conscientious writer should at least point out whether this "supra-class" situation actually exists and whether the claims of so-called cooperativists can be realized. Otherwise, he is only an irresponsible introducer.

　　Chun Ming's book even tries its best to introduce the weapons of war that imperialist warmongers use to intimidate the people of the world. For example, it introduces the so-called "absolute weapon" by saying: "The latest type of weapon. According to legend,... for example, a pinch of parrot toxin is enough to exterminate 20 million humans."--Readers need fresh knowledge in all aspects, but they cannot tolerate others introducing the blackmail and deception of international hooligans as new scientific knowledge to them!

　　III

　　These dictionaries not only contain the political and theoretical errors mentioned above, but also contain various technical, factual, and common-sense errors. Bei Xin's book explains "illiterate" by saying, "Anyone with eyes but without knowledge, that is, someone who has not received an education, is called 'illiterate'." The explanation of "Dadaism" is "Denying the sacredness of the world, advocating complete realism." It is simply unbelievable that such statements were written by someone who considers themselves capable of compiling a dictionary. Bei Xin's book says that the Soviet Union is composed of seven republics, and Bei Xin's continuation only recognizes eight planets orbiting the sun. These are all common-sense errors that should not exist. Chun Ming's book mentions the time of the dissolution of the Third International in two places, one saying it was 1940 and the other saying it was 1942, but it was actually 1943. Even the facts right in front of us are wrong. The Huaihai Campaign was in November 1948, but Chun Ming's book says it was in November 1949, and says that "This was the first greatest victory after the Pingjin Campaign."

　　Even just from the selection of entries, it can be seen that these dictionaries lack sufficient rigor. When the attitude of objectivism develops into recording everything heard, many meaningless and even completely unnecessary names are piled up in the dictionary. These types of names are often copied from various dictionaries on the market, talking about them with relish. Of course, this is related to the philistine attitude of the more the better. For example, some slogans that happened to appear in the anti-Chiang student movement (such as the so-called "Eat It All Movement," etc.), and some temporary institutions during the Old Political Consultative Conference (such as the so-called "Three-Person Group," "Five-Person Group," etc.) do not need to be regarded as new names or new knowledge as special entries. The book called "Dictionary of New Knowledge" includes entries such as "wit," "narrative," and "creation," and the book called "Dictionary of New Terms" includes entries such as "Tian Kuang Festival," "Earth Treasury Festival," "Fenlong Day," "Old Lang Xian Shi's Birthday," "Jiahua Annual Meeting," "Suez Canal Navigation Anniversary," etc., and even Sakyamuni and Socrates have become materials in the "Dictionary of New Terms." It is difficult to have any other explanation for such indiscriminate collection of nouns other than using the profit-seeking viewpoint of pursuing quantity.

　　The points listed above are certainly only a small part of the points worth criticizing in these three dictionaries, but at the same time, we are not saying that the entire content of the three dictionaries is wrong. In particular, many entries in Bei Xin's continuation and Chun Ming's book are explained appropriately and are beneficial to readers. But precisely because a good dictionary is extremely needed by readers, a dictionary containing a considerable number of errors will be extremely harmful to readers. Bei Xin's continuation says in the preface: "Although this dictionary has been proofread by many people and revised many times, even after the entire manuscript was typeset and the paper mold was made, it was found that there were still places that needed to be revised, and we did not hesitate to destroy the paper version and correct it before reprinting." This cautious and serious attitude is welcome. Therefore, we should ask serious editors and publishers to have a higher degree of responsibility to readers and treat their work with more seriousness, so as to avoid their work, which should have been thanked, instead arousing the indignation of readers.

　　评几本辞典
    长风　王城
    一、新知识辞典（北新书局）
    二、新知识辞典续编（北新书局）
    三、新名词辞典（春明书店）
    适应广大读者的需要，市面上出现了不少用“新”字标名的辞书。但这些辞书多半是不能使读者信赖的。此地所提出的几种也许还不是同类辞书中最坏的，但它们所包含的错误已无法一一列举，这里只能提出几个主要之点来谈谈。
    在这三本辞典中，最显著地表现着对读者不负责任的态度的是北新本“新知识辞典”。这本辞典在一九四八年四月出“增订一版”，一九四九年九月出“订正六版”。但所谓“订正”，显然并不是认真的彻底修改，因此，不但保留着许多陈旧的、不合时的材料，而且在最近订正版中，仍然有着难以容忍的荒谬的记载。例如：在“魏德迈”条中说：“离华前并发表声明，严责中国政府整饬刷新，因否则即不能击溃共党。”“提审法”条中引了所谓“国民党训政时期约法第八条”，且加以说明：“这是一条保障人民基本自由的法律。”“五月学潮”条（指一九四七年京沪一带学生运动）中说：“政府闻悉，乃宣布‘紧急处理法’，经镇压后方告平息。”像这一类的条文，难道就不应该“订正”一下么？又如“西安事变”条中说：“张学良杨虎城于西安兵谏军事委员会委员长蒋介石氏……蒋氏著有西安半月记一书，记述此事经过。”“四项诺言”条中说：“政治协商会议召开时，蒋主席宣布的四项诺言。”甚至到了“订正”的时候，编者也不觉得有必要指明这个“主席”“委员长”的记述和诺言全部是个大谎！再如“北伐”条中说：“蒋介石氏任国民革命军总司令，因得民众拥护，先后下湖南，克复武汉、南京及黄河流域一带，统一全国。”这样的糊涂的历史认识至少也该“订正”一下吧。蒋介石在“北伐”中到了南京及黄河流域一带时，已经公开成为反革命者，难道我们的辞典编者始终愿意装做不知道么？
    这就是说，在这本北新辞典中，很突出地表现着在国民党反动统治下所养成的盲目的“正统”观念。
    同时，这本辞典又毫不负责任地向读者传述着美英资产阶级的谎话。他认真地介绍：“红色法西斯”是“美国反共分子给美共的称号”；“在实行新民主主义的国家里，凡是共产党议员占多数的市镇被称为小莫斯科”；“采取红色恐怖政策的革命政府在历史上有……十月革命后的俄罗斯苏维埃政府”；“近来各国反苏分子亦有指苏联工人阶级专政为极权政治的”；“路透社是全世界最富权威的通讯社”等等。
    对于资产阶级的错误观点，这本辞典是完全没有能力给以分析批判的。例如当它提出所谓“政治民主与经济民主”的条目时，作了一大堆混乱而平庸的说明，结论说：“在今日世界上政治民主的国家是指资本主义的民主国家，经济民主的国家是指社会主义的民主国家；前者以美国为代表，后者则为苏联。”当它解释“一党专政”时，就说：“这种统治方式可以施行于不同的政治原则之下，如布尔塞维克党之于社会主义的苏联，国社党之于法西斯主义的德国，抗战前国民党之于中国。”其实高度的经济民主必然与高度的政治民主相结合，所谓政治民主与经济民主原本是资产阶级为了混淆视听而制造出来的区别。社会主义国家固然只有一个政党，然而它是和党外的广大劳动人民结成紧密的联盟的，在本质上不同于法西斯的一党专政。这种种错误观念曾长期地使许多人受骗。一本新的辞典如果不能纠正这种错误，反而继续加以传播，又何贵乎这本“新”的辞典？
    甚至像“社会”这样最平常的名词，在这本辞典中的解释是“社会是人类相互合作的最大体制……”，对“人性”的解释是“人类所特有的一种普遍的本性，如同情心，怜悯心，快活，愤怒等等……”这真是，你不解释倒也罢了，你一解释，反而把人搞糊涂了。
    比较起来，北新本《新知识辞典续编》（一九五○年一月初版）和春明本《新名词辞典》（一九四九年十月再版）是较好一点的，但仍旧保留着某些同样性质的错误。北新续编中解释“自由”时说，在资本主义国家里，自由的意义是指人民有言论、出版和选择议会的权利，在社会主义国家，是指人民有衣食、工作、教育等等权利，这仍旧是区分政治民主和经济民主的滥调。春明本在“一党专政”条下肯定了苏联也是一党专政，虽然他企图说明这和资本主义国家中的一党专政不同，但因为他不懂得无产阶级专政并不等于共产党专政，所以他还是陷在这种混乱的观念中间。
    辞典中的解释因为是定义式的，就必须是完密的、周到的，否则就会成为似是而非或完全错误。例如北新续编解释“一国社会主义”，大意说，因为不能发动世界革命，所以一国有首先建设社会主义的可能。这丝毫也没有接触到为什么到了帝国主义时代一国建设社会主义之成为可能的真正理由。同书解说“人种论”时，虽然批评了这种帝国主义者的“学说”，然而结论说，“帝国主义的侵略殖民地，并不是人种问题，其实是民族问题。”这还是没有说对，因为帝国主义的侵略虽然总是利用民族问题的名义，其实只是为了反动资产阶级的侵略扩张的利益。再如春明本中对于各种阶级所下的定义也很多是错误的或不完整的，例如说：“半无产阶级”是“虽然没有生产手段，靠出卖劳动力而生活，但意识上仍然没有无产阶级化的人”，这样的说法使人得到错误的印象，以为划分阶级是要根据人的思想意识状况的。同书“妇女问题”中说，“妇女问题是封建社会的产物，在资本主义社会中，只能得到部分的解决……”这也是错误的。妇女问题也正是资本主义社会的产物，资本主义并不能解决什么妇女问题，只是把金钱的压迫代替了封建的宗法压迫而已。
    在涉及新民主主义的国家政策时，辞典的编撰者更不应采取轻率的，自以为是的态度。这类的错误在这些辞典中也很不少。例如春明本中有“新政协与旧政协”和“旧政协路线”条（这一条也一字不改的见于北新续编中），其中都包含着不适当的说明。春明本中又有“清算斗争”一条，其中说，土改中要召集群众大会，“在会上，大众将反奸（？）恶霸罪状一件件宣布出来，剥削的要偿还，杀人的要偿命。”这种描写是错误的，有害的。北新续编中有“明理第一”条，据说这是“解放区社会教育的一种方针”。这简直是毫无根据的胡说！
    既然辞典是为现在的中国人写的，读者自然有权利要求执笔者不要只是抄袭成文，必须和当前中国的实际作必要的联系。这样的要求虽然似乎高了一点，然而是不能不提出的。北新续编和春明本中都有“工资”条，他们一致断定，工资无非是产生于资本家对工人的剥削制度中的。执笔者如果认真想一下，新民主主义社会和社会主义社会中还有另一种根本性质不同的工资，他们自己也应该觉得他们所提出的解释是不完备的，而且足以引导读者到错误的观念上去的。
    像以上所指出的这些错误，固然有关执笔人的理论与政治的水平，但是如果执笔人更多负责任的精神，更多思考研究的精神，就会在执笔写每一条目时，多找一些有关的参考书来看一下，那么，这许多错误并不都是不可避免的。
            二
    就这几本辞典看来，一个辞典的执笔人如果采取庸俗的客观主义的态度，他就决不可能把他的工作做得很好。这就是说，他不应该是一个无原则的抄书匠，听到什么就写下来什么，好像对于他所写下来的东西，他可以毫不负责任似的。这也就是说，他不应该像资产阶级的庸俗的新闻记者那样地采取“有闻必录”的态度。
    固然我们不能说，这几本辞典一般地都表现着这种客观主义的态度，但是就从以上所举出的那些错误中，也可以看出，它们是还不能从这种态度中摆脱出来的。
    如果所写的确是事实，也仍可以并不是恰当的说明。北新续编关于曾任英国外相的艾登介绍说，“他是最修边幅的男子，法国人称他为最善修饰的英国人……”这也许是事实吧，但是用辞典上的篇幅来写这种美国式的小报所中意的材料，究竟是为了什么目的呢？北新续编和春明本都特别告诉我们，美国煤油大王洛克菲勒乐善好施，“对于我国北京协和医院和北京人的发现，他都捐助资金。”这是为了说明，中国人民对于这个美国的大独占资本家应该感恩图报么？春明本在“红衣主教”一条中说：“红衣主教在世界上总数不过数十，中国胜利后亦有一人。”说出这个“事实”，是为了证明中国抗日战争胜利所博得的国际荣耀么？
    再拿“九国公约”这一条为例来看一下。北新本解释说：“…主要的以保障中国领土之完整，各国在华机会均等，门户开放等为原则，这是美国对付日本的手段，但自九一八以来，所谓九国公约已毁灭无余了。”这样的解释给人以什么印象呢？九国公约是美国对付日本而有利于中国的，可惜被日本侵略所毁灭了。春明本也同样说，九国公约“旨在保证中国主权独立及行政领土之完整，并担保列强援助中国维持一稳定之政府。但日本在九一八事变后就将九国公约撕毁了。”这两位执笔者都只按照九国公约本来的文字和一些表面现象来叙述一下，不去作进一步分析，指明九国公约的实质是帝国主义列强共管中国的一套精致的枷锁。美日的对立在这里也还不是重要的本质，重要的是帝国主义对中国的关系。辞典虽然只能作简单的说明，但也必须适当地作这样的本质的分析，才能提供读者以真正有益的知识。否则，仅满足于皮相的“客观”叙述，那就成了帮同帝国主义欺骗中国人民了。
    很明白的，辞典上对于一种错误观念或主张不应该仅仅“介绍”而不作任何批评。北新本提出“超阶级的”这个条目而只加以解释说，“不附属任何阶级，超越于任何阶级之上，叫做超阶级的。”续编中解释“合作主义”说：“主张大家站在共同利益与平等原则上实行生产、消费或分配的主义。合作主义者希望借合作社及合作运动来消弭资本主义、个人主义经济的弊害。”在这种好像不错的条文中实际上正起了宣传错误思想的作用。一个认真的执笔人至少应该指出，这种“超阶级”的情况究竟是否存在，所谓合作主义者的主张究竟能否实现。否则，他就只是不负责任的介绍者而已。
    春明本甚至竭力介绍帝国主义战争贩子借以吓诈世界人民的战争武器。例如介绍所谓“绝对武器”说：“为现代最新式的武器，据传说，……例如一公撮的鹦鹉毒素就足以灭绝二千万的人类。”——读者是需要各方面的新鲜知识的，但他们不能容忍别人把国际流氓的讹诈和欺骗当做科学的新知来介绍给他们！
            三
    在这些辞典中不仅包含以上所举的政治性的理论性的错误，而且还包含着种种属于技术的和有关事实材料的乃至常识性的错误。北新本解释“文盲”说，“凡有眼睛而无知识，即没有受过教育的人，叫做‘文盲’。”对“达达主义”的解释是“否认世界的神圣、主张彻底的现实主义。”这种说法简直不能使人相信是自认为有编辞典能力的人所写下来的。北新本说，苏联是由七个共和国组成的，北新续编只承认环绕太阳的有八大行星，这都是不应有的常识性的错误。春明本中两处提到第三国际解散时间，一处说是一九四○年，一处说是一九四二年，但实际上是一九四三年。甚至就在眼前的事实也弄错了，淮海大捷是在一九四八年十一月，但春明本却说成是一九四九年十一月，而且说“这是接平津之后的第一次最伟大的胜利”。
    甚至只从条目的选择上已可看出，这些辞典是缺乏足够的严格性的。当客观主义的态度发展为有闻必录时，辞典中便堆积了许多无意义的乃至完全不需要的名辞。这类名辞又常常在市面上各种辞典中互相抄袭，津津乐道，当然这和多多益善的市侩态度又是相关连的。例如在反蒋学生运动中偶然出现的一些口号（如所谓“吃光运动”之类），在旧政协时期一些临时性的机构（所谓“三人小组”，“五人小组”之类），都没有必要当作新名辞新知识作为专条的。在叫做新知识辞典的书中收入了“机智”“叙述”“创造”这种条目，在叫做新名词辞典的书中收进了什么“天贶节”，“地藏节”，“分龙日”“老郎先师生日”“嘉华年会”“苏彝士通航纪念”等等条目，而且连释迦牟尼、苏格拉底都成为“新名词辞典”中的材料了。这样滥收名词，除了用追求数量的营利观点来说明外，是很难有其他解释的。
    以上所举出的各点，固然还只是这三本辞典中值得指摘之处中的一小部分，但同时，我们也不是说，三本辞典的全部内容都是错误的。特别是北新续编和春明本也有许多条目是解释得恰当而有益于读者的。但正因为一本好的辞典是为读者所极需要的，所以一本包含着相当多的错误的辞典是会极有害于读者的。北新续编序言中说：“本辞典虽经多人校订，多次修改，甚至在全稿排成打好纸型后，发见还有需要修改之处，不惜把纸版毁弃，改正重排。”这种慎重认真的态度是值得欢迎的。所以我们应该向认真的编辑人和出版者要求更高度的对读者负责的态度，用更多的严肃精神对待他们的工作，以免他们的所做的本来应当受到感谢的工作反而引起了读者的愤慨。
