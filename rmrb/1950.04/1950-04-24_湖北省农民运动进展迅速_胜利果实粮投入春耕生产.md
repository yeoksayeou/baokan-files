Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st: The rent reduction and anti-despot movement in rural Hubei has been widely launched in more than 70% of the province. To date, approximately 8 million peasants throughout the province have joined the tide of rent reduction and anti-despotism. In particular, the peasant movements in the five special districts of Xiangyang, Huanggang, Yichang, and Xiaogan have progressed rapidly and are on a larger scale. In the Huanggang Special District's Xishui and Macheng counties, and the Xiangyang Special District's Nanzhang, Hongshan, Xiangyang, and Zhaoyang counties, the rent reduction movement is nearing completion, while other areas are continuing rent reduction work in conjunction with spring ploughing. According to incomplete statistics, peasants throughout the province have returned more than 150 million catties of rent grain from landlords through the aforementioned struggles and invested the resulting victory grain in spring ploughing and production.

With the large-scale unfolding of the rent reduction and anti-despot movement throughout the province, the political awareness of the broad masses of peasants has been generally enhanced, and they have successively demanded to be organized. According to statistics from seven special districts including Daye, by the end of February, more than 6,000 villages had established peasant associations, with a total of more than 900,000 members. In March of this year, the province also convened a peasant representative meeting to formally establish the Provincial Peasants' Association, which further promoted the rapid development of peasant association organizations. According to statistics from Jingzhou Special District at the end of March alone, the district's peasant association membership had grown to more than 300,000, more than doubling the original membership. At the same time, more than 4,000 outstanding peasants throughout the province have joined the Communist Party of China; some areas have also begun to establish branches of the New Democratic Youth League. In order to defend the fruits of their victory, the broad masses of peasants have actively organized militia forces. In the Xiangyang and Yunyang special districts, more than 30,000 peasants have participated in militia organizations. More than 50% of the villages in the Huanggang and Xiangyang special districts have begun to preliminarily transform their village governments.

　　湖北省农民运动进展迅速
    胜利果实粮投入春耕生产
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口二十一日电：湖北农村的减租反恶霸运动，已在全省百分之七十以上的地区普遍展开。到目前为止，全省已有约八百余万的农民投入了减租反恶霸的浪潮。其中尤以襄阳、黄冈、宜昌、孝感等五个专区的农民运动进展迅速，规模较大。黄冈专区的浠水、麻城，襄阳专区的南漳、洪山、襄阳、枣阳等县的减租运动已将近结束，其他地区则正结合春耕继续进行减租工作。据不完全统计，全省农民已从上述斗争中向地主退回租粮一亿五千余万斤，并将所得果实粮投入春耕生产。
    随着全省减租反恶霸运动的大规模展开，广大农民群众的政治觉悟已普遍提高，纷纷要求组织起来。据大冶等七个专区的统计，到二月底止，已有六千余村建立了农会，共有会员九十余万人。今年三月全省又召开了农民代表会议，正式成立省农民协会，使农会的组织更得到迅速的发展。仅据荆州专区三月底的统计，该区农会会员已发展到三十余万人，比原有会员数增加了一倍以上。同时全省已有四千余优秀的农民参加了中国共产党；部分地区并已开始建立了新民主主义青年团的支部组织。广大农民为保卫已得的胜利果实，纷纷组织民兵武装。襄阳、郧阳两专区即有三万余农民参加了民兵组织。黄冈、襄阳等专区有百分之五十以上村庄开始初步改造了村政权。
