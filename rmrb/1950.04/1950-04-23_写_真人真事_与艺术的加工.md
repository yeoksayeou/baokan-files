　　Writing "True Stories" and Artistic Processing
    Xiao Yin
            I
    A comrade wrote in a letter: "…To powerfully write about a person, one can only emphasize and elevate their real actions and deeds. However, the 'time,' 'location,' and 'event' of when and where the person had these actions and deeds cannot be changed or added to. Otherwise, the local audience (or readers) will object. For example, if writing about a labor hero from a certain village, writing about what they did last year as happening this year, or writing about what they did in one place as happening in another place, or even fabricating certain actions and events for the sake of writing convenience and power, or adding characters around their real deeds, then the people of that village will say that the play is not realistic, thereby diminishing the effect of the work. This is the opinion of some people. The opinion of another group of people is that 'time,' 'location,' and 'event' can sometimes be changed, and characters can also be added in certain situations. The reason for this group is: Writing about the events and people of a certain place does not necessarily mean performing it in that place…"
    This letter raises two questions: (1) If writing about true people and true events cannot be done without any "distortion," the audience will say that you are not writing realistically; (2) Since the time and location of the event have been changed, or something has been added to the true story, is it still necessary to use the real names of the real people?
    Not long ago, many comrades wrote articles about true people and true events, and everyone affirmed that true people and true events can be written, and they can even be written in a typical way. What is the reason? That is, based on real people and events, their basic characteristics are highlighted and described, so that the essential character of the characters is expressed more completely, more concentrated, more ideally, and more realistically. This is very correct; Fadeyev's "The Young Guard" was written in this way.
    However, the most important issue that our literary and art workers are encountering now, and which needs to be resolved immediately, is not how to write true people and true events in a typical way, but what attitude the masses will take towards works based on true people and true events that have been processed. Many people have reflected that peasant audiences require the characters in the work to be exactly the same as the real people, not only the time and location of the event cannot be changed, but even the details of life must be exactly the same as the real people. This troubles some comrades who are engaged in literary and art work among the masses. They say: "The masses already demand that writing about true people and true events should not be 'distorted' at all, and also demand that it be educational. We really don't know how to write."
    However, what is the crux of the problem?
            II
    Do workers, peasants, and soldiers only like works that depict real people and events? And reject all works that give artistic processing based on true people and true events? This is obviously not in line with the facts. Indeed, in a certain unit, soldiers once criticized some works that wrote about the true people and events of their own department, thinking that these works were "fabricated out of thin air," but at the same time, they liked works such as "Encounter at Sea" and "Wang Xiuluan," which were based on true people and true events and supplemented with imagination. According to a news report: A machine gun company in a certain unit performed "Practical Study and Hard Practice." This play wrote about a soldier's hard practice with heart, writing that he was very humble, and asked about shooting essentials whenever he saw others. After being told, he gradually memorized them and did them correctly. But what difficulties did he encounter in learning? How did he overcome them? What ideological basis was his practical study and hard practice built on? None of this was expressed. So after the soldiers watched it, they said, "It's boring," and some even said, "We all know who the model is. The play is not as good as what we usually see!"
    What do these facts illustrate? It shows that the masses do not reject all works that give artistic processing based on true people and true events. As long as the imagination, generalization, and exaggeration are reasonable, in line with the laws of reality development, and in line with the causal laws between reality and character, the masses will not only not object, but will also be welcomed by them. They will not be satisfied with moving life onto the stage as it is, because "we have seen enough of this kind of life on weekdays, why do we still need to watch a play?" The working masses especially do not like moving superficial life onto the stage. Works that only list life phenomena and do not reflect the essence of life more deeply are not welcomed by the masses. The reason is because such works cannot give the audience any positive inspiration and education.
    Then, why in some occasions do workers, peasants, and soldiers sharply criticize some works of writing true stories with imagination added? Why do they say that those works are not realistic? Why do some cadres say that the authors of these works are "fabricated out of thin air"? Of course, there are other reasons, but the main reason is that the imagination is not reasonable. If imagination is divorced from the reality foundation and the basic characteristics of the character, then "imagination" will become fabrication, and it will not be possible to realistically reflect life. If we distort life in our works because of unreasonable imagination, then what reason do we have to blame the masses? What reason do we have to blame them for "not understanding art and only liking to move true people and true events onto the stage as they are"?
    If the work profoundly expresses life, profoundly expresses the character of the characters, and profoundly expresses the historical and social reasons for the formation of the character, the masses will not haggle over the superficial details of life. Otherwise, if life is reflected very superficially and the work does not have a deeper meaning to attract the audience, then the audience will inevitably pursue superficial reality in the details. I remember there was a play that wrote about true people and true events, but because it was all about life phenomena and had no ideological content, the audience who were familiar with the true story said "it's boring," and then pursued reality in the superficial details. They said, "As far as I know, that room is not as high as it is in the play?" However, the peasant audience who were familiar with Wang Xiuluan, after watching the play "Wang Xiuluan," clearly knew that what was staged in the play was not necessarily exactly the same as Wang Xiuluan herself, but because the essential characteristics of Wang Xiuluan were profoundly expressed (even exaggerated), the audience not only did not care about those unimportant details, but said, "Wang Xiuluan is so diligent!"
    It can be seen that the masses do not generally oppose works based on true people and true events with imagination added. The question is how the author imagines and processes them. If the imagination and even exaggeration are reasonable, and life is reflected very deeply, the masses will not have any objections. But if the imagination is unreasonable and the life being described is only superficial, then, regardless of whether what you write is true people and true events or not, the masses have reason to say that your work is not realistic.
            III
    Then, in order to make the character that the author wants to express more prominent, is it permissible to appropriately concentrate the real and scattered events and organize the scattered events around the main struggle? I think it should be permitted. Because only in this way can the theme be better completed, and the characteristics and qualities of the characters can be expressed more completely, more realistically, and more persuasively.
    Some people may ask: "Since it is allowed to add imagination, exaggeration, and generalization on the basis of true people and true events, is it necessary to still use the real names of real people in the work?" To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the specific situation. If the real person you are describing does have the characteristics and qualities that a great hero in great art must have, and in order to make these characteristics and qualities fully expressed and very real, you concentrate the scattered events, and still use the real person's name, I think it is also possible. As long as you can deeply and realistically write out the characteristics and qualities of this great hero, the changes in the time and location of the event, the masses will probably not raise any objections (that is, any objections are secondary). But if your description object is a person who does not fully possess the qualities of a great hero in reality, when writing, the author summarizes many heroic characteristics that they have observed and felt on this character in order to make this character more ideal and complete. This is a normal creative method, but if the character in the work still uses the name of the original person, the masses will say that you have fabricated it.
    Therefore, I have this understanding: If the "real person" you are describing does have the characteristics of a great character in great art, and this character is indeed higher than ordinary people, then, as long as you faithfully write out this character and write out the environment that formed this character (class reasons or historical reasons), it may become a very typical character. Such a work, although using the real person's name, can withstand the test whether in the local area or in other areas, and will receive its due educational effect. But if your description object does not yet have the complete character of a great hero, but only the touching or triggering of a certain action of this "real person" causes many impressions of other similar heroes to emerge in the author's mind, and these impressions deeply move the author, and then after a considerable period of gestation, gradually cultivate a more complete heroic image. At this time, what necessity does the author still have to stick to true people and true events? Why not artistically generalize the factors of many new qualities that you have repeatedly experienced and been moved by to create a more complete, more ideal, and more realistic character image?
            IV
    After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, in order to oppose fabricating themes out of thin air, works of writing true people and true events have increased, and these works have indeed played a positive role in educating the people. In the era of guerrilla warfare, within a certain scope such as companies or districts and villages, using true people and true events as demonstrations or passing on experiences and lessons, and boosting combat or production enthusiasm, this is an achievement that no one can deny. Secondly, the writing method of true people and true events is also very beneficial for those writers who have never understood the working masses and the working life. As long as you faithfully describe "true people and true events," no matter what, it will always have more real-life experience than the works written by "closing the door and building a car" in the "pavilion room." A writer who has never understood the working masses and the working life can gradually understand the working life and the combat life by starting to write true people and true events, and this still has practical significance today.
    But if we always stay at the level of rigidly copying "true people and true events" and do not take a step forward on the existing foundation, it will be difficult for the work to obtain a high level of ideological content. We believe that the currently popular writing method of true people and true events (requiring a rigid and unadulterated copying method) will only make the work fall into the quagmire of empiricism. This writing method has limitations and one-sidedness. It limits the expression of a wider range of life and experience. If some authors' ideological level is not high and they are not good at essentially understanding life, and are not good at seeing the general meaning from special characters and events, and are only satisfied with recording life phenomena, or are satisfied with photographically recording life phenomena, then the works written in this way can at most only convey some local experiences and reflect some local problems. Of course, such works cannot be said to be meaningless in the local area at that time, but for the masses in the vast areas, its meaning is not great.
    Works based on true people and true events as "models" cannot be improved, the question is how you write them. Of course, the first problem that should be solved here is that the author's political level and ideological level must be improved. If this problem is not solved, no matter how you write, rigidly writing true people and true events, or generalizing various characteristics on one character, it will not make the work obtain great educational significance.

### 写“真人真事”与艺术的加工

专栏：

　　写“真人真事”与艺术的加工
    萧殷
            一
    有一位同志来信说：“……要有力的写一个人，只能在本人的真实行动和事迹上，突出的加以提高，但本人在什么时候，什么地点，有过什么行动和事迹，这种“时间”、“地点”和“事件”不能有所变更或增添，否则，当地的观众（或读者）便会反对。如写某村某劳动英雄，把他去年的事写在今年，把他在那一个地方有过的事写在这一个地方，甚至为写作的方便和有力，给他虚构某些行动和事件，或围绕他的真事上增添人物，那末，某村的人看了这个剧便会说是不真实的，以致减损了作品的效果，这是一部分人的意见。另外一部分人的意见，认为“时间”、“地点”和“事件”有时可以变更的，也可以在某种场合添增人物，这部分人的理由是：写某地的事和人，不一定在某地演出。……”
    这封信提出了两个问题：（一）如果写真人真事不能写得一点“不走样”，观众就会说你写得不真实；（二）既然改换了事件的时间和地点，或在真人真事上增添了一些东西，仍用实在人物的真名字是否必要？
    在不久以前，曾有不少同志写过关于真人真事的文章，大家都肯定地说，真人真事可以写，而且还可以把真人真事写得典型。理由何在呢？那就是根据实在的人物事件，将其基本特征加以突出的描写，使人物的本质性格表现得更完全，更集中，更理想，更真实。这是很正确的，法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”就是这样写成的。
    可是，现在我们文艺工作者所遇到的最重要的，而又需要马上解决的问题，却是如何把真人真事写成典型，而是群众对于加工了的真人真事的作品，会采取怎样的态度。许多人都反映说：农民观众要求作品中的人物跟实在的人物一模一样，不仅事件的时间地点不容变动，就连生活细节也要求跟实在人物完全一样。这使在群众中作文艺工作的一部分同志感到苦恼，他们说：“群众已要求写真人真事一点‘不走样’，又要求有教育意义，我们真不知怎么写了。”
    但是，问题的症结，究竟在那里呢？
            二
    工农兵群众难道只喜欢描写实在的人物和事件的作品？而排斥一切根据真人真事给以艺术加工的作品么？这显然不合乎事实。的确在某部队里战士们曾指责过某些写他们本部门的真人真事的作品，认为这些作品是“客里空”式的捏造，但同时他们却喜爱“海上遭遇”、“王秀鸾”等一类根据真人真事又经过想像补充了的作品。据一篇通讯报道：某部机关枪连演出“实学苦练”，这个剧是写一个战士用心苦练的情形，写他很虚心，一见别人就问射击要领，经人告诉他之后，他渐渐背熟了，作的也正确了。但在学习中他遇到什么困难？怎样克服的？他这样实学苦练建筑在什么思想基础上？都没有表现出来。所以战士们看了之后，说：“没意思”，有的还说：“谁模范我们都知道，这戏演的还不如平常看到的事情好哩！”
    从这些事实说明了一些什么问题呢？说明了群众并不是排斥一切根据真人真事给以艺术加工的作品，只要想像、概括、夸张得合理，合乎现实发展法则，合乎现实与人物性格之间的因果法则的艺术加工，群众不仅不会反对，而且将受到他们的欢迎。把生活原本原样地搬上舞台，他们是不会满足的，因为“这样的生活在平日已看够了，何必还要来看戏呢？”劳动群众尤其不喜欢把表面生活搬上舞台。只是罗列生活现象，没有更深入的反映生活本质的作品，群众是不欢迎的。原因就是因为这样的作品不能给观众什么积极的启示和教育。
    那末，工农兵群众为什么在某些场合，又尖刻地指责了一些加入了想像的写真人真事的作品呢？为什么说那些作品不真实呢？一些干部为什么又说这些作品的作者是“客里空”呢？其中当然还有其他原因，但最主要的原因，却是想像得不合理。想像，如果离开了现实基础，离开了人物性格的基本特征，那末，“想像”就会变成杜撰，就不可能真实地反映生活。如果我们因为想像不合理，在作品中歪曲了生活，那么我们还有什么理由责怪群众？还有什么理由责怪他们“不懂艺术，只喜欢原本原样把真人真事搬上舞台”呢？
    如果作品深刻地表现了生活，深刻地表现了人物性格，而又深刻地表现了形成性格的历史的社会的原因，群众就不会在外表的生活细节上去斤斤计较，否则，如果生活反映得很表面，作品没有较深的意义去吸住观众，那末观众必然会在细节上追求外表的真实。记得曾有一个剧，写的是真人真事，但由于写的尽是生活现象，没有什么思想内容，结果熟悉这真事的观众在说了“没意思”之后，就在外表的细节上追求起真实来了，他们说：“我晓得的，那间房子那里像戏里的这样高呢？”可是，熟悉王秀鸾的农民观众，看了“王秀鸾”一剧之后，明明知道戏上演的未必尽同王秀鸾本人一模一样，但因王秀鸾的本质特征被深刻地表现（甚至夸张）出来，因而观众不仅不去计较那些不关重要的细节，反而说：“王秀鸾就是这样勤劳！”
    由此可见，根据真人真事加以想像的作品，群众并不一概反对，问题要看作者如何去想像，去加工。如果想像甚至夸张得合理，生活又反映得很深刻，群众是不会有什么非议的。但如果想像得不合理，而被描写的生活又仅仅是表面的，那末，不管你所写的是真人真事也罢，不是真人真事也罢，群众都有理由说你的作品是不真实的。
            三
    那末，为了使作者所要表现的性格表现得更突出，将实在的分散的事件加以适当的集中，使分散的事件围绕着主要的斗争加以组织，是否容许呢？我认为应该被容许的。因为只有这样，才可能更好的去完成主题，才可能把人物的特性和品质表现得更完全，更真实，更有说服力。
    也许有人问：“既然允许在真人真事的基础上加以想像，夸张，概括，那末在作品中是否有必要仍然用真人的名字呢？”要回答这问题，必需看具体的情况。如果你所描写的真人确已具有伟大艺术的伟大英雄所必具的特性与品质，为了使这特性与品质表现得很完全，很真实，而把分散的事件加以集中，并且仍用真人的名字，我想也是可以的。只要能够深刻地真实地写出这伟大英雄的特征与品质，事件的时间与地点的变更，群众大概不会提出什么异议的（即有异议也是次要的）。但如果你的描写对象，是一个实际上不完全具备伟大英雄的特质的人，在写作时，作者为了使这人物性格写得更理想更完全，把平时观察、感受到的许多英雄特性的因素，概括在这人物身上。这本来是正常的创作方法，可是如果作品中的人物还用原有人物的名字，群众就会说你杜撰了。
    因此，我有这样的认识：如果你所描写的“真人”确已具有伟大艺术中伟大性格的特征，这性格的确高于一般的人，那末，只要忠实的写出这个性格，并写出形成这性格的环境（阶级原因或历史原因）就可能成为一个很富有典型意义的人物，这样的作品，虽然用真实人物的名字，但不管在当地或其他地区，它都经得起考验，都会收到它应有的教育效果的。但如果你的描写对象还没有伟大英雄的完整的性格，只是由于这“真人”某一行动的感动或触发，使作者脑海里浮现了许多其他类似的英雄的印象，这些印象深深地感动着作者，然后经过相当时间的孕育，逐渐培养成一个较完整的英雄形象。这时候，作者还有什么必要拘泥于真人真事？为什么不把自己再三经验过又感动过的许多新品质的因素，加以艺术的概括，塑造更完全、更理想、更真实人物形象呢？
            四
    延安文艺座谈以后，为反对凭空杜撰题材，写真人真事的作品多起来了，这些作品的确起过它积极的教育人民的作用。在游击战争时代，在连队或区村等一定范围内，借真人真事来作示范或传递经验教训，鼓舞战斗或生产情绪，这是谁也不容抹煞的成绩。其次，真人真事的写作方法，对于那些一向不了解劳动群众不了解劳动生活的作家，也是很有好处的，只要你忠实的去描写“真人真事”，无论如何总比坐在“亭子间”里“闭门造车”所写出来的作品要有更多的生活实感。一个一向不了解劳动群众和劳动生活的作家，由写真人真事入手去逐渐理解劳动生活和战斗生活，一直到今天仍然有它实际的意义。
    但是如果总是停留在刻板模写“真人真事”上，不从现有的基础上提高一步，作品就很难获得高度的思想内容。我们认为像现在所流行的真人真事的写作方法（要求刻板的，一点不走样的模写方法），只会使作品陷入经验主义的泥坑。这样的写作方法是有局限性与片面性的，它限制了更广泛的生活与经验的表现，如果再加上某些作者的思想水平又不高，不善于本质地理解生活，不善于从特殊的人物事件中看出一般的意义，只满足于生活现象的记录，或满足于照相式地记录生活现象，那末，这样写出来的作品顶多只能传达一些局部经验，反映一些局部问题。当然，这类作品在当时当地，还不能说毫无意义，可是对于广大地区的群众来说，它的意义就不大了。
    以真人真事为“模特儿”的作品不是不可以提高的，问题要看你如何去写。当然，这里首先应解决的问题，是作者的政治水平与思想水平必须提高一步，如果这问题不解决，不管你如何写法，刻板的写真人真事也罢，概括各种特征在一个人物身上也罢，都不能使作品获得巨大的教育意义的。
