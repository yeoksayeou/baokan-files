　　Seventy Ordnance Factory Amateur School Opens
    Seven Hundred Workers Study On Time
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The opening ceremony of the Seventy Ordnance Factory Amateur School in Beijing was held on the evening of the 19th at the Central Academy of Drama. More than two thousand employees and guests attended. At the meeting, the school's principal, He Jinzhang, and the factory's military representative, Jia Xiaodong, both encouraged everyone to be determined to persist in studying and overcome difficulties. Student representative Diao Tingliang assured everyone that he would study hard, not be late or leave early, and not drop out midway. After the meeting, the Xinhua Printing Factory, the Clothing Factory, the People's Daily staff, and the Seventy Drama Troupe performed the Yangko opera "Two Good Friends," as well as songs, crosstalk, and plays.
    The factory's amateur school currently has 705 students, divided into primary and intermediate levels. The primary level has 10 classes in Mandarin Chinese and 11 classes in arithmetic. The intermediate level has 3 classes in Chinese language and 3 classes in mathematics (algebra and arithmetic). There are also 2 compound classes for the security team, totaling 28 classes. There are 2 full-time teachers and 28 part-time teachers (including several cadres with teaching experience). Study time is two hours after work every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. The Party, government, labor union, and youth league jointly ensure that no meetings or other activities that hinder learning are held during study time. The teaching materials all follow the regulations of the Beijing Municipal Amateur Education Work Committee. In the past, the factory had short-term training classes, technical classes, and rotational training classes, etc., but because there was no good leadership and long-term plan, the workers felt that there was no system. This time, with a regular school, especially after solving various difficulties such as classrooms, teachers, funding, and teaching materials, nearly half of the employees were able to participate in the study.

　　七十兵工厂业余学校开学
    七百工人按时学习
    【本报讯】京市七十兵工厂业余学校于十九日晚假中央戏剧学院举行开学典礼。出席职工及来宾二千余人。会中该校校长贺晋璋及该厂军代表贾晓东均勉励大家下决心坚持学习，克服困难。学生代表刁廷良向大家保证要好好学习，不迟到不早退，不中途退学。会后由新华印刷厂、被服厂、人民日报社职工及七十剧团等演出秧歌剧“俩相好”，及歌咏、相声、话剧。
    该厂业余学校现有学员七百零五人，分初、中二级，初级国语十班、算术十一班，中级国文三班、数学（代数、算术）三班，另设保卫队复式班两班，共二十八班。专任教员二人，兼任二十八人，（其中有教学经验的干部多人。）学习时间是每周一、三、五下午下班后二小时，党政工团共同保证在学习时间不开会，不作其他妨碍学习的活动。教材均照北京市业余教育工作委员会的规定。该厂过去曾有短训班、技术班、轮训班等，但因没有很好的领导和长远的计划，工人感到没有系统，这次有了正规的学校，特别是解决了教室、教员、经费、教材各种困难，所以能有近一半的职工参加学习。（郭茂林、张钧）
