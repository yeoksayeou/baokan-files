Zhang Bingqian, a first-class tax model cadre of Liaoxi Province, is the newly promoted deputy director of the Xinlitun Tax Office in Heishan County.

He knew that relying solely on his own enthusiasm was not enough for anti-smuggling work. He had to organize the masses, mobilize the masses, and turn anti-smuggling work into mass work to achieve greater results. Therefore, he took the initiative to contact the local public security station and organized a mass-based anti-smuggling network in Hujia Town. Before organizing and mobilizing the masses to assist in anti-smuggling, he first discussed the matter with the administrative village head and convened a villagers' meeting to explain today's tax policies to the masses. After the masses realized that today's tax revenue was closely related to them, they automatically helped the government to inspect and prevent profiteers from taking advantage of loopholes. Last November, Heishan County carried out the pre-collection of business tax. Due to insufficient cadres, the Heishan County Taxation Bureau decided to temporarily abandon the tax collection in Changjia Town (market held every three days) under the jurisdiction of the Jiangjiatun Tax Office, and concentrate all its efforts on business tax collection. After hearing about this, Comrade Zhang Bingqian felt that this would mean a loss of more than 10 million yuan each market day, which would cause a great loss to the country, so he volunteered to squeeze out time to do this work. After repeated requests, he finally obtained the director's consent. That day it was already 8:00 PM, and the north wind was blowing strongly, but tomorrow was the market day, so he and another comrade went to Changjia Town, which was thirty miles away, in the dark. Because they were not familiar with the road, they did not reach Dagushan until 11:00 PM, where they found a place to rest their eyes. The next morning at 2:00 AM, they rushed to Changjia Town to collect taxes. By the time the market dispersed, it was already getting dark, so they took the tax money back to the county bureau, and when they arrived in the city, it was already brightly lit. After that, every market day, they would depart from the bureau at 3:30 in the morning and not return until it was very dark. No matter how cold it was, even sometimes the ink in the steel pen used to write tax tickets would freeze if they didn't breathe on it, or when it was snowing heavily, they never stopped. They worked like this for two consecutive months, until the business tax for that period was collected, and then people from the Jiangjiatun Tax Office were sent to replace them. In these two months, they collected more than 200 million yuan for the country.

In his anti-smuggling work, Zhang Bingqian encountered many merchants who wanted to bribe him and "make friends" with him, but he sternly refused them all. Zhang Bingqian came from a poor peasant family and had also worked as a laborer and a worker. In 1948, he stood up and participated in the local work team to do mass work. Due to work needs, in early 1949, he was transferred to the Badaohao Tax Office of the Heishan Taxation Bureau to work in anti-smuggling. However, he had only studied for two years as a child and could not even write the Arabic numerals "2, 6, 7, 4"; let alone write tax tickets or use an abacus. But he remembered what his superiors had said: "If you don't know something, learn it. As long as you concentrate on learning, you will be able to do it." So, he resolutely dispelled his initial thought of transferring and began to seize the time to concentrate on learning. By July of last year, he had learned even multiplication and division. Later, when there was less work, he also followed other comrades to learn auditing, paying attention to how others audited, where they found problems, and keeping an eye on the handwriting on the accounts. Slowly, he also became familiar with this business. Now he is a very skilled tax worker in terms of business. Many comrades were surprised and said, "You are really incomparable. I never thought you would make such rapid progress in business. We have been working for two or three years, but we are not as familiar with the business as you are!"

　　辽西省一等税务模范干部张柄乾
    铭惠
    辽西省一等税务模范干部张柄乾，是新提拔的黑山县新立屯税务所副所长。
    他知道缉私工作单靠自己的热情，是不够的，必须组织群众，动员群众，把缉私工作变成群众工作，才能收到更大的效果。所以他就主动的和公安派出所取得联系，并在胡家镇组织了群众性的缉私网。在组织和动员群众协助缉私前，他首先和行政村长商量，召开了村民大会，对群众说明今天的税收政策。群众认识了今天税收是与他们息息相关之后，便自动帮助政府检查，不让奸商钻空子捡便宜。去年十一月，黑山县进行营业税预征工作。由于干部不够，黑山县税务局决定暂时放弃姜家屯税务所管辖的常家镇（三天一集）的收税，而把力量全部集中在营业税征收。张柄乾同志听到这事后，觉得这样每一集就少收一千多万元，国家要受很大的损失，就自愿挤出功夫来做这件工作。经过三番两次的要求，终于取得了局长的同意。当天已是晚上八点钟北风刮得很大，但明天就是集日，他同另一个同志就摸黑往三十里远的常家镇奔去。因为路不熟，半夜十一点才到了大孤山，找个地方合了合眼。第二天早上两点钟，他俩就赶到常家镇去收税。集散时，天也要黑了，他们就又带着税款回县局，到城里早已是满城灯火了。以后每到集日时，他们都是清晨三点半钟由局里出发，很黑的时候才能回来。不论天怎样冷，甚至有时写税票的钢笔一不用气哈就要结冰，或是下大雪，他们从没间断过。这样一连干了两个月，直到那期营业税收完，才又由姜家屯税务所派人替了去。这两个月他们共给国家征收了两个多亿元。
    在缉私工作中，张柄乾遇到不少商人要贿赂他，要和他“交朋友”，但都被他严词拒绝了。张柄乾是雇农出身，也当过劳工和工人，一九四八年翻身参加了当地工作队做群众工作。由于工作需要，一九四九年初他被调到黑山税务局八道壕税务所作缉私工作。可是他小时候只念了二年书，连阿拉伯字的“２、６、７、４”都还不会写；更谈不到写税票、打算盘了。可是他记起了上级说的话：“什么事不会就学，只要专心学就能会。”所以决心打消了最初想调动工作的念头，开始抓紧时间专心学习。到了去年七月时，连乘法除法都学会了。后来在工作少些的时候，他又跟着别的同志出来学习查账，注意别人怎样查，从那里发现问题，留心账上的字体，慢慢也熟悉了这门业务。现在他已是一个业务上很熟练的税务工作人员了。不少同志都惊奇的说：“真比不了你，没曾想你业务上进步这样快，我们干二、三年了，也没像你对业务这样熟！”
