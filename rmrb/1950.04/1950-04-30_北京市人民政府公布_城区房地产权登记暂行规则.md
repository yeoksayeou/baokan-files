【Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch】 To determine the ownership of public and private real estate in the urban area of ​​this city, complete cadastral surveying and mapping, and benefit urban construction, the Beijing Municipal People's Government recently announced the "Provisional Regulations for Urban Real Estate Ownership Registration in Beijing." Registration is divided into six types, namely general registration, transfer registration, change registration, correction registration, other rights registration, and cancellation registration. (1) General Registration: All owners who do not have a real estate ownership certificate from the Land Administration Bureau should personally apply to the Land Administration Bureau for registration (public property shall be handled by the management authority), but those who already have a fake real estate certificate from the previous government, and whose real estate situation and ownership have not changed, will have their registration procedures postponed; (2) Transfer Registration: For the transfer of real estate due to sales, gifts, exchanges, or inheritance, both parties shall jointly apply to the Land Administration Bureau for registration, but inheritance registration may be handled separately by the heir with proof; (3) Change Registration: For newly built, rebuilt, demolished, divided, merged, or approved remaining real estate, the owner shall personally apply for registration, but those who need to consult with interested parties shall be individually instructed to handle it; (4) Correction Registration: If the current real estate ownership certificate does not match the actual situation, the owner shall apply for registration; (5) Other Rights Registration: For the establishment of usufructuary rights, mortgage rights, land use rights (construction, passage), the right holder shall jointly apply for registration with the obligated person; (6) Cancellation Registration: If the registered other rights have been extinguished, the originally applying right holder and obligated person shall jointly register. For real estate owned by temples, ancestral halls, guilds, private schools, companies, factories, shops, and other social organizations, applicants must hold a registration certificate from the competent authority, and the person in charge indicated on the certificate shall be the registration applicant.

For the above registrations, if the registration applicant is not in this city, or cannot personally apply for registration due to reasons even though they are in this city, they must issue a power of attorney certified as true by the household registration authority (such as the public security police station) or the serving organization where they are located, and hand it over to an agent to apply for registration on their behalf. Transfer registration, change registration, and other rights registration shall be applied for registration within one month from the date of establishment or completion of the change of the contract. Those who apply for other registrations without completing the general registration procedures shall complete or expedite the general registration at the same time; the general registration deadline remains January 31, 1950, as originally scheduled. Those who register after the deadline will be fined at the discretion of the amount depending on the number of days overdue. If the real estate deed is lost and registration is applied for, if it is found to be on file after verification, a notice must be published in the People's Daily for three days, declaring the original deed invalid, and a certificate from the public security police station where the real estate is located and a guarantee from two or more neighboring property owners or two reputable businesses must be obtained, and only after the on-site inspection is verified will the replacement be approved. If the registration applicant fraudulently or forges documents to obtain registration, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the fees already paid and revoking the registration, they will also be sent to the judicial authorities for punishment.
