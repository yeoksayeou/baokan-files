Gaoyi County, Huayuan Village
Completes Village Elections, Launches Spring Plowing

[This newspaper dispatch] In Gaoyi County, Hebei Province, Huayuan Village, thanks to the leadership's grasp of the principle of prioritizing production and closely integrating democratic governance with production, and with the help of the work team, the village completed its elections in eight days, from March 8th to 16th. They elected their own representatives' assembly and village government committee and have already actively launched the spring plowing production campaign under the leadership of the new government. The village is one with a relatively solid work foundation, with a total of 104 households and 443 people. This democratic governance campaign was designated as a model village. After the work team, composed of five county and district cadres, arrived in the village, they first chatted individually with cadres, party members, and the masses to understand the situation. They discovered that the village had two major problems that needed to be resolved before the election: First, the masses had many confused ideas about the village elections, such as "Whether we vote or not, aren't they still the old cadres?" "The higher-ups already have a list!" "No matter who is elected, just don't elect me!" etc.; second, spring plowing production lacked leadership and was developing spontaneously. Based on the above situation, the work team decided to organize forces over four days and conduct repeated democratic education through winter schools, party member meetings, Communist Youth League meetings, women's federation meetings, etc., and party members and others conducted in-depth propaganda among the masses about the benefits of democratic governance, explaining that democratic governance is mainly to improve production. They immediately organized a spring plowing production inspection team to investigate and solve the specific difficulties of the masses in production. After learning that the masses lacked waterwheels and cotton seeds, they immediately helped the masses borrow five waterwheels and tried to purchase cotton seeds and publicized the forest protection policy. Because the masses had a full understanding of the village elections and production policies, the village elections proceeded smoothly. After deliberation and discussion, fifteen village representatives and two county and district representatives (including three women) were elected. At the first congress of representatives, the village's production plan and forest protection charter for this year were drafted, and the government committee was elected and announced at a mass meeting. The representatives immediately launched activities to help the masses formulate production plans, increasing the village's cotton planting area from the original plan of 400 mu to 550 mu. Representative Qiu Guang also helped widowed and orphaned households organize mutual aid teams. The next day, the new village chief, He Guigeng, climbed on the roof to summon the masses to dig the river, and they gathered in less than half an hour. The three-day project was completed in just two days. Now, under the leadership of the new village government, the masses in the village are actively launching spring plowing and tree planting campaigns.

　　高邑县花园村
    完成村选开展春耕
    【本报讯】河北省高邑县花园村，由于领导上掌握了生产第一、民主建政密切结合生产的方针，经过三月八日到十六日的八天时间，在工作组帮助下，已经完成了村选，选出了群众自己的代表会和村政府委员会，并已在新的政府领导下，积极展开了春耕生产运动。该村是一个工作基础较好的村庄，全村共一百零四户、四百四十三人。这次民主建政，被确定为示范村。由五个县区干部组成的工作组到达该村后，首先与干部、党员和群众个别闲扯，了解情况，发现了该村有两大问题须在选举前求得解决：一件是群众对村选存在着很多糊涂观念，如“选不选吧，还不是那些旧干部？”“上级早有底子啦！”“不管选谁吧，反正别选我！”等；一件是春耕生产缺乏领导，形成自流。工作组根据以上情况，决定以四天时间，组织力量，通过冬学、党员会、团员会、妇女会等反复进行民主教育，并经过党团员等向群众深入宣传民主建政的好处，说明民主建政主要是为了搞好生产。并当即组织了春耕生产检查组，调查并解决群众生产中的具体困难。在了解了群众缺乏水车、缺乏棉籽等困难后，立即帮助群众贷了五辆水车，并设法代购棉籽与宣传了护林政策；由于群众对村选与生产政策有了充分了解，村选才顺利进行。经过酝酿讨论，选出了十五位村代表和两位县、区代表（内妇女三人）。第一次代表大会上，拟定了今年全村生产计划和护林公约，选出了政府委员会，并在群众大会上作了宣布。代表们随即展开活动，帮助群众订生产计划，使全村种棉面积从原计划的四百亩增至五百五十亩；代表秋广并帮助孤寡户组织了互助组。第二天新村长何贵庚登房召集群众挖河，不到半小时就集合齐了。三天的工程，只做了两天就完成了。现该村群众，正在新的村政府领导下，积极展开春耕和植树运动。
