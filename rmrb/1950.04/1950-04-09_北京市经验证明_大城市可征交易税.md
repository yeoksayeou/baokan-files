Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Beijing's experience proves that transaction taxes can be implemented in large cities. Beijing's transaction taxes on livestock, grain, cotton, and homespun cloth were first comprehensively levied in the suburbs in mid-April of last year. Starting January 6th of this year, grain and livestock transaction taxes were also comprehensively levied in the city (transaction taxes on cotton and homespun cloth have not yet been levied in the city due to small tax sources).

Due to inconsistencies in customary trading locations and methods, Beijing adopted three different approaches to management and collection: First, in markets where buyers and sellers trade directly, entrusted firms, warehouses, and shops on the seller's side to collect and remit taxes to the tax bureau, which provided them with a 3% handling fee. Second, in markets where original brokers and brokerage firms engaged in intermediate exploitation, they were educated and re-elected as transaction clerks. The transaction clerks or brokerage firms collect and remit taxes to the tax bureau, extracting a certain percentage as a handling fee, and the tax bureau sends personnel to inspect and supervise at any time. Third, in grain companies, the tax bureau directly sends personnel to collect taxes. Public and private retail outlets are temporarily not taxed. General rice shops are only allowed to buy in the market and retail in the shops.

Experience over the past few months shows that: First, transaction taxes play a certain role in managing the market and eliminating the intermediate exploitation of brokers and brokerage firms (middlemen). For example, the Mule and Horse Market outside Deshengmen originally had 41 mule and horse shops and more than 380 brokers. Their methods of obtaining illegal profits were varied, and transactions used jargon, deceiving both buyers and sellers. After rectification, 20 people were retained as transaction clerks, and others were transferred to fixed shop staff; transaction clerks collect taxes and extract a certain percentage as handling fees. Mule and horse shops are only allowed to buy and sell on behalf of customers, and all transactions are open and transparent. As a result, the burden on both parties has been reduced, and the number of mule and horse transactions has also increased. Second, the transaction tax has little impact on consumers. For example, grain and meat prices in Beijing have not fluctuated due to the imposition of the transaction tax. On the other hand, it reduces the number of times goods are resold, because if goods are resold too many times, the price will be high due to multiple payments, making it difficult for buyers to sell. Third, the transaction tax is levied on the buyer, the business tax is levied on the business turnover (seller), and the commercial tax is levied on the business turnover of the merchant (seller). The three do not overlap. Fourth, the tax rate is low and the tax base is broad, which has a considerable impact on national fiscal revenue.

### 北京市经验证明  大城市可征交易税

　　北京市经验证明
    大城市可征交易税
    【新华社八日讯】北京市的经验证明，交易税在大城市完全可以实行。北京牲畜、粮食、棉花、土布四项交易税于去年四月中先在郊区全面开征，本年一月六日起亦在市内全面开征粮食及牲畜交易税（棉花、土布因市内税源小，暂未开征）。
    由于惯常的交易地点与交易方式的不一致，因此北京在管理与征收上也采用了三种不同的方式：一、在买卖双方直接交易的市场，委托卖方的行、栈、店代征，汇交税局，由税局给予百分之三为手续费。二、在原有牙纪、牙行进行中间剥削的市场，则教育改选牙纪为交易员。由交易员或牙行代收，汇交税局，提取一定比率作手续费，税局随时派员检查和监督。三、在粮食公司，则由税务局直接派员征收。公私营门市零售暂时不征。一般米粮店只准在市场买进，在门市零售。
    数月以来的经验表明：第一、交易税对管理市场，取缔牙纪、牙行（中间人）的中间剥削有一定作用。如德胜门外骡马市场原有骡马店四十一家和牙纪三百八十余人，其获取非法利润的方式五花八门，交易用黑话，买卖双方都受欺骗。整理后留下二十人作交易员，其他转业作固定店员；交易员代收税款，提取一定比率作手续费。骡马店只准代客买卖，买卖一律公开，结果交易双方负担减少，骡马交易头数也增加了。第二、征交易税对消费者的影响不大，如北京的粮价、肉价都没有因为交易税的开征而发生波动。另一方面却减少商品的转手次数，因为转手多了货物便因多次缴纳而价昂，买主难于卖出。第三、交易税征自买方，营业税课自营业流水（卖方），行商税课自行商的营业流水（卖方），三者并不重复。第四、税率低、税源广，对国家财政收入有相当作用。
