Xinhua News Agency, April 15th:
    Hankou Dispatch: Since last winter and this spring, incidents of Kuomintang remnants and lurking secret agents sabotaging economic construction have occurred continuously in various parts of the Central South Administrative Region. The sabotage crimes of the secret agents fall into the following categories: 1. Spreading rumors, colluding with local bullies, landlords, and feudal secret societies, coercing the masses, inciting riots, and creating grain robbery incidents. For example, in Gushi County, Henan, there were eight cases of secret agents inciting the masses to rob warehouses last month, two of which were stopped in time by protection personnel. 2. Damaging cotton and grain warehouses. For example, gunpowder and matches were found in cotton in a warehouse in Zhecheng County, Henan, and sulfur was found in a warehouse in Xinzhou District, Huanggang, Hubei. Cotton transport ships in Mianyang were secretly splashed with gasoline by secret agents. 3. Damaging industrial and mining sites. For example, the Xikengkou Coal Mine in Shangrao, Jiangxi, was sabotaged by the former mine manager and technicians (who were secret agents) in September last year, flooding one mine. The Shaoyang Chemical Factory in Hunan was once surrounded by secret agents and bandits, but they were repelled by public security personnel and local armed forces, foiling the secret agents' conspiracy. 4. Damaging railway transportation. For example, 41 packages of explosives with detonators already installed were found under the tracks near Yueyang on the Yuehan Line on January 20th; At the end of January and the beginning of February, communication lines within Linfeng County, Hunan, were widely sabotaged by secret agents. In addition, secret agents also colluded with local bullies and landlords to sabotage district public offices and used despicable means such as assassination and poisoning in an attempt to harm government working cadres. However, the evil acts of the secret agents generally focus on sabotaging our economic construction.
    The Hankou Yangtze River Daily published an editorial on this matter, calling on the Party, government, army, and people to heighten their vigilance, jointly protect warehouses, mines, roads, and factories, and safeguard state property. The editorial pointed out that the reason why sabotage incidents occur continuously is because the remaining bandits attempt to use various evil destructive activities as their main means of dying struggle; it is also because some working cadres of the People's Government have been blinded by victory, are negligent and derelict of duty towards the enemy's conspiracies and tricks; and some cadres do not know how to use scientific and democratic management systems and cannot truly mobilize and rely on the workers to manage and protect industrial and mining enterprises. Therefore, the editorial requires that the staff of the People's Government and the people jointly cherish and protect state property, and overcome certain blind senses of peace and complacency caused by the national victory. Secondly, strict organization and strengthened protection are required. Whether it is a mine, factory, railway, or warehouse, a certain amount of armed force must be equipped, and it must be combined with the local masses to form a security organization. Thirdly, a strict inspection system, personnel system, and responsibility system must be established, and the masses must be relied on to implement it and conduct regular in-depth inspections. In areas where accidents have occurred, it is necessary to promptly and thoroughly investigate the causes and responsibilities and take effective measures.

　　特务破坏我经济建设
    中南区连续发现残匪破坏罪行
    各地应提高警惕保卫国家财产
    【新华社十五日讯】汉口讯：去冬今春以来，中南行政区各地连续发生国民党残匪潜伏特务破坏经济建设的事件。特务的破坏罪行有如下几类：一、散播谣言，勾结恶霸地主、封建会门，胁迫群众，煽动暴乱，制造抢粮事件。如河南固始县在上月曾发生特务煽动群众抢劫仓库案八起，其中两起经防护人员及时设法制止。二、破坏棉、粮仓库。如河南柘城县仓库的棉花内发现火药、火柴，湖北黄冈新州区仓库发现特务放进硫磺，沔阳的运棉船上被特务偷偷地泼上汽油。三、破坏工矿场所。如去年九月江西上饶西坑口煤矿为特务分子的旧矿长及技师破坏，淹没矿井一所。湖南邵阳化学工厂曾被特务和土匪包围，经公安人员、地方武装人员击退，使特务阴谋未逞。四、破坏铁路交通。如粤汉线岳阳附近轨道下，一月二十日发现已装好雷管的炸药四十一包；一月底、二月初，湖南临沣县境内电线遍遭特务破坏。此外，特务还勾串恶霸地主破坏区公署，并施行暗杀、放毒等卑鄙手段，以图谋害政府工作干部。但是特务们的罪恶行为一般地以破坏我经济建设为重点。
    汉口长江日报曾为此发表社论，号召党政军民一致提高警惕，共同护仓、护矿、护路、护厂，保卫国家财产。社论指出：破坏事件之所以连续发生，是由于残余匪帮企图以各种罪恶的破坏活动作为其垂死挣扎的主要手段；同时也因为人民政府的一部分工作干部被胜利冲昏头脑，对敌人的阴谋诡计麻痹大意，失责渎职；而且某些干部还不懂得运用科学的、民主的管理制度，不能真正发动与依靠工人群众来管理和保护工矿。因此，社论要求人民政府的工作人员和人民群众，大家共同爱护和保卫国家财产，克服由于全国胜利而产生的某些盲目的太平观念和麻痹思想。其次，应严密组织，加强防护。不论对矿山、工厂、铁路或仓库，均须配备一定武装，并与当地群众相结合，成立安全组织。第三，须建立严格的检查制度、人事制度、责任制度，并须依靠群众贯彻执行，及举行定期的深入检查。曾经发生事故的地区，要及时深入地进行追查原因和责任，采取有效措施。
