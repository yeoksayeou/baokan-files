The publishing industry in New China is beginning to flourish. To ensure the healthy development of our publishing industry, we believe that, as in other areas, serious criticism and self-criticism are indispensable.

The state of book reviewing in China has not been very good. When, on the one hand, there is a phenomenon of superficial "praise," and on the other hand, there is a phenomenon of viewing criticism as "attacks," proper book reviews cannot be firmly established. Now is the time to establish a principled criticism system that benefits the people's publishing cause.

The vast readership is reading new books and newspapers with an insatiable thirst, and they have all sorts of opinions about these books and newspapers. By giving the broad masses an opportunity to express their opinions, and based on these opinions, we will certainly be able to guide book reviewing work onto the path it should take and achieve the effects it can achieve.

Our small publication earnestly requests the support of the broad readership, authors, and publishers.

    新中国的出版业正在开始活跃起来。为了使我们的出版业健康地向前发展，我们相信，也如同其他方面一样，严肃的批评与自我批评是不可缺少的。
    书评的工作在中国向来的情形并不怎么好。当一方面有浮浅的“捧场”的现象，一方面有把批评看作“打击”的现象的时候，正当的书评是不能结实地建立起来的。建立有原则性的、有益于人民出版事业的批评制度，现在是时候了。
    广大的读者在如饥如渴地读着新的书报，他们对于书报是有各种各样的意见的。让广大群众有机会表示他们的意见，以这些意见为基础，我们一定能够使书评工作走向它应该走的道路，并收得它可能收得的效果。
    我们这一个小小的刊物，热烈地要求广大读者和著作人、出版人的支持。
