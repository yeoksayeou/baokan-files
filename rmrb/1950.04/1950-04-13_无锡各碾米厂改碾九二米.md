　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 12th—The China National Cereals Corporation, Southern Jiangsu Branch, here, began selling 92 standard rice on the 10th; market supply began on the 8th. After the Government Administration Council issued its decision to change grain processing standards and increase edible grain, the company immediately notified the rice mills processing for it to stop milling fine rice and consulted with the publicly-owned Sanhe Rice Mill to convert to milling 92 rice first. The test milling on the 6th of this month showed that the rice yield was extremely good. The Wuxi Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has also ordered the Rice Milling Industry Association to comply with the Government Administration Council's decision. Wuxi is one of the four major rice markets in the country, with 53 rice mills in the city. The maximum monthly output can reach 45,540,000 catties of white rice. In the past, about 88 catties of white rice could be milled from every 100 catties of brown rice. If calculated at the maximum output, more than 51,760,000 catties of brown rice were required per month. Now that the conversion to milling 92 rice has been made, only more than 49,480,000 catties of brown rice are needed, saving more than 2,270,000 catties of brown rice.

　　无锡各碾米厂改碾九二米
    【新华社无锡十二日电】此间中国粮食公司苏南分公司十日起开始门售九二标准米；市场供应八日即已开始。政务院关于改变粮食加工标准、增加食用粮食的决定颁布后，该公司即通知代其加工的各碾米厂一律停碾精米，并与公营三和米厂商妥，先行改碾九二米。经本月六日试碾结果，出米情况极为良好。无锡市工商局亦已令碾米业同业公会遵行政务院该项决定。按无锡为全国四大米市之一，全市现有碾米厂五十三家，每月最高产量可达白米四千五百五十四万斤，过去每百斤糙米可碾白米约八十八斤，如以最高产量计，月需糙米五千一百七十六万余斤；而今改碾九二米以后，仅需糙米四千九百四十八万余斤，可节省糙米二百二十七万余斤。
