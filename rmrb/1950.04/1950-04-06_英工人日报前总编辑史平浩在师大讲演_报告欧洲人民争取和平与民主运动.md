【News from the Municipal News Agency】Steve Platt, the former editor-in-chief of the British "Daily Worker," who recently arrived in Beijing, gave a lecture yesterday at Normal University, titled: "New Developments in the European People's Movement Against War and for Peace and Democracy."

In his speech, Steve Platt pointed out that British and American imperialists are intensifying war preparations in European capitalist countries through the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty. Steve Platt said: The European people, led by the working class, not only demand peace but are also engaged in an organized struggle for lasting world peace. He spoke from the Peace Conference held in Wroclaw in the spring of 1948 to the recent plenary session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held in Stockholm, pointing out that in the past two years, the peace camp has achieved great advantages in the balance of power both internally in various countries and internationally.

Steve Platt is one of the founders of the British Communist Party. Accompanying Steve Platt were his wife, Jennett, "Daily Worker" editor Alan Winnington, and Shapiro. The four of them are currently advisors to the International News Bureau of the News Administration.
