Price Stability Prevents Speculation
Han Private Silver Shops Shift to Production
Organizing Joint Loans to Invest in Legitimate Industry and Commerce

[Our Newspaper News] To overcome certain difficulties currently felt by the private silver shops in Wuhan and to guide social idle funds towards production, it has been decided to organize a joint lending office under the leadership of the state bank, concentrating funds into legitimate industry and commerce. After the currency contraction and general price stability in March, private enterprises in Wuhan sought new outlets. The financial industry faced the most difficulties, with many suffering from increased non-performing loans, difficulty in issuing deposits, and serious deficits due to bloated institutions and excessive consumption, putting their business in jeopardy. Some firms have already closed for liquidation. In the past, private silver shops generally engaged in speculative activities, taking advantage of inflation to engage in speculation and disruption in the market. Their loans used to account for more than 70 percent of all loans in the commercial sector, thereby fueling commercial speculation. After price stability in March, this type of industry that relied on usury for commercial speculation fell into despair. What followed was that the speculative financial industry had difficulties in issuing deposits and recovering loans. In order to overcome the difficulties, the industry formed a joint lending office on the 20th of last month under the leadership of the Hankou branch of the People's Bank, absorbing idle funds and investing in production enterprises. As of the 12th of this month, the office has successively accepted applications from the textile, flour, chemical, and oil pressing industries in Wuhan, releasing a total of 4.8 billion yuan in collateralized loans. The recipients of the loans include the Yuhua, First, and Zhenhuan textile mills, as well as the Shengxin Flour Mill, Fuxin Flour Mill, Hanchang Chemical Company, and the Kaiming Enterprise Bureau. After receiving the loans, the aforementioned factories mostly used them to purchase raw materials and pay wages, solving the important difficulties of each factory, enabling production to proceed smoothly, and initially playing a role in coordinating government policies, concentrating financial power, and guiding idle funds through the line to the right track of production.

In addition, the Textile Loan Committee, which was formed by private firms in Hankou in November of last year to meet the needs of the time, is the same in nature as the current joint lending office and is also led by the Hankou branch of the People's Bank, so it will be formally merged with the lending office in the short term. Its lending business will still be managed uniformly by the joint lending office, and the total loan quota for the two institutions has been determined to be 8 billion yuan, of which 7.4 billion yuan has already been loaned out. In order to increase lending funds, expand the scope of loans, and meet current urgent needs, the joint lending office held a firm meeting on the 18th and decided to increase the lending amount to 16 billion yuan, and the loan targets were also expanded, so the capital turnover difficulties of many legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises can be appropriately resolved in the future.

　　物价平稳无法投机倒把
    汉私营银钱业转向生产
    组织联合放款投向正当工商业
    【本报讯】武汉市私营银钱业为克服目前本身所感受的若干困难，并引导社会游资投向生产，特决定在国家银行领导下组织联合放款处，集中资金投向正当工商业。三月份通货紧缩物价普遍稳定后，武汉私营企业纷纷谋求新的出路。各行业中以金融业困难较多，大多因放款呆账增多，存款不易放出，加之本身机构臃肿，消耗太大而形成严重亏空，以致营业岌岌可危，有些行庄已停业清理。私营银钱业过去一般从事投机活动，他们利用通货膨胀，投机倒把，在市场上兴风作浪。他们的放款，过去在商业方面经常占全部放款的百分之七十以上，因而助长了商业投机。三月份物价平稳后，此种依附高利贷进行商业投机的行业均陷入绝境，随之而来的是投机性的金融业发生了存款放不出、放出去的收不回来的困难。该业为渡过难关，乃在人民银行汉口分行领导下，于上月二十日组成联合放款处，吸收游资，投放生产事业。截至本月十二日止，该处已先后接受汉市纺织、面粉、化学及榨油等工业之申请，放出质押放款共四十八亿元。获得贷款者计有裕华、第一、震寰等三纱厂及胜新面粉厂、福新面粉厂、汉昌化学公司、开明企业局等单位，上列各厂得到贷款后，均大部用于购买原料及开付工资，解决了各该厂的重要困难，使生产得以顺利进行，初步发挥了配合政府政策，集中金融力量，引导游资透过行庄走向生产正轨的作用。
    又汉市私营行庄于去年十一月为适应当时需要所组成之纺织贷款委员会，因其性质与此次之联合放款处相同，并同时为人民银行汉口分行所领导，故短期内将其使与放款处正式合并。其放款业务仍由联合放款处统一经营，并确定两机构贷款额度共为八十亿元，现已共贷出七十四亿元。为增加贷放资金，扩大贷款对象，适应目前迫切需要，联合放款处曾于十八日召开行庄大会，决定增加放款额为一百六十亿元，贷款对象亦予扩大，故今后不少正当工商业的资金周转困难可以获得适当解决。
