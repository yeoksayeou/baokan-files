Electric News Agency Copenhagen Dispatch Exposes American Plane "Disappearance" Lie
　　American Planes Were Preparing for "Search" Long Before "Disappearing"!
　　[Xinhua News Agency, April 15th] A dispatch from Copenhagen by the Electric News Agency on the 12th powerfully exposes the shameless lies made by American officials to cover up the violation of Soviet airspace by American military aircraft, and reveals the American conspiracy, with the consent of the Danish government, to occupy Denmark under the pretext of "searching for missing aircraft."
　　The Electric News Agency pointed out: The U.S. government is trying to argue that the "missing Navy patrol bomber" was unarmed, and therefore could not have opened fire on Soviet aircraft. It is attempting to use this to counter-accuse the Soviet aircraft of improperly opening fire on unarmed American aircraft. However, Danish reporters personally saw that many of the same type of aircraft now in Denmark were carrying guns and cannons. To this, an American press officer insisted at a press conference that what they saw were just cooling pipes without gun barrels. However, American pilots told reporters that these aircraft could be ready to fire in a matter of minutes. Later, the American authorities suddenly ordered a ban on taking pictures of these aircraft, further confirming this fact.
　　According to a report by the Danish newspaper "Land and People," the so-called "search" operation by the United States was planned long before the United States announced that a plane had "disappeared." American air force officers arrived at Kastrup Airport a few days before the "search" began. On April 6th or 7th, at least one aircraft carrying such officers flew to Kastrup, and senior officials from the American Embassy went to greet them. In the first few days after these officers arrived, Americans were seen moving ammunition boxes.
　　The Electric News Agency further pointed out: The Danish government not only turns a blind eye to the outrageous behavior of American military aircraft violating Danish sovereignty and landing without permission at Kastrup Airport, but even tries to excuse it. A spokesman for the Danish Foreign Ministry told an Electric News Agency reporter that the United States had requested permission in advance for its aircraft to land at Kastrup, and that the Danish government had granted it. However, when the reporter asked whether this included military aircraft, the spokesman said that in such emergency rescue operations, there was no time to ask for details. He said that the issue of permitting armed aircraft to land was now "under consideration." However, he quickly added that he did not think the Danish government would object, because "in such emergency situations, it is impossible to demand the removal of weapons."
　　After the road signs leading to Kastrup Airport were changed by angry Danish patriots to "to the American bomber" base, the Danish government even dispatched a large number of police to Kastrup Airport to prevent the expected demonstrations by the Danish people against American bombers coming to Denmark.
　　The Electric News Agency also described the arrogant attitude of the United States in completely disregarding Danish and Swedish territorial sovereignty. An American press officer at a press conference in Copenhagen even declared that the American "search planes" would "search" Danish and Swedish territory. And the Swedish Foreign Ministry, after American aircraft had already flown over the Karlskrona naval base, which even Swedish domestic airlines were not allowed to fly over, only lodged a protest with the American ambassador in the mildest of terms under pressure from the people.

　　电通社哥本哈根消息揭露美机“失踪”谎言
    美机“失踪”前早就准备“搜寻”了！
    【新华社十五日讯】来自哥本哈根的电通社十二日消息，有力地揭露了美国官方为掩饰美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空而作的无耻谎言，并揭露了美国在丹麦政府同意下，企图借口“搜寻失踪飞机”而占领丹麦的阴谋。
    电通社指出：美国政府竭力申说“失踪的海军巡逻轰炸机”是没有武装的，因此，决不能向苏联飞机开火，它企图以此反咬一口，说苏联飞机不该向非武装的美国飞机开火。但是，丹麦记者们却亲自见到了现在丹麦的许多同式飞机都带着枪炮。为此，美国新闻官就在记者招待会上硬说，他们所见的只是没有枪身的冷却管。然而，美国飞行员却告诉记者，这些飞机在几分钟内就可以准备好开火。稍后，美国当局又突然下令禁止拍摄这些飞机的照片，因而进一步证实了这一事实。
    据丹麦“国土与人民”报揭露称，美国所谓“搜寻”的行动，早在美国宣布有飞机“失踪”以前就筹划了。美国空军军官在“搜寻”开始前几天，就来到了加斯特鲁普机场。在四月六日或七日，至少曾有一架飞机载着这种军官飞抵加斯特鲁普，美国大使馆的高级官员并曾前往迎接。在这些军官到达的头几天，有人看见过美国人在搬运弹药箱。
    电通社又指出：丹麦政府对于美国军用机侵犯丹麦主权，而在加斯特鲁普机场擅自着陆的横暴行为，不仅熟视无睹，甚至曲为包容。丹麦外交部发言人告诉电通社记者称：美国曾预先请求准许其飞机在加斯特鲁普降落，并经丹麦政府允准。但是，当记者问到是否包括军用机在内时，发言人竟说：在那样的紧急援救行动的情况中，没有来得及问到细节。他说，关于允准有武装的飞机着陆的问题，现在正在“考虑中”。可是，他赶快又说：他不以为丹麦政府会提出异议，因为“在那样紧急情况中，不可能要求卸除枪枝”。
    在通向加斯特鲁晋机场的路标被愤怒的丹麦爱国人民改成为“去美国轰炸机”基地之后，丹麦政府甚至还出动了大批警察开到加斯特鲁普机场，以阻止预期的丹麦人民反对美国轰炸机来到丹麦的示威。
    电通社也叙述了美国对丹麦瑞典领土主权完全蔑视的骄横态度。美国新闻官在哥本哈根记者招待会上竟宣称：美国的“搜寻飞机”，将“搜寻”丹麦同瑞典的领土。而瑞典外交部在美国飞机已经飞越连瑞典本国民航机都不准飞越的卡尔斯克罗那海军基地以后，只是在人民的压力之下，才以最温和的措辞向美国大使提出了抗议。
