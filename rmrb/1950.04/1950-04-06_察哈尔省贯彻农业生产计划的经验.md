　　The Experience of Chahar Province in Implementing Agricultural Production Plans
    Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture
    Chahar Province has gained considerable experience in the transmission, deployment, and implementation of agricultural production plans through agricultural production conferences, which can serve as a reference for other regions.
    Most counties in the province conveyed and deployed the plans through county representative meetings, combined with labor models, cadres, and award conferences. The transmission and deployment reached the village level at the latest by March 20th. The experience of the transmission and deployment is: First, there must be a clear center. In addition to discussing the draft production plan for 1950, the focus was especially on the spring plowing movement, how to solve the urgent demands and special needs of the local masses, and repeated consultations, so that the plan becomes the masses' own resolution. Second, fully promote democracy and review the winter production work in 1949, generally in the form of group meetings, so that the opinions of the representatives can be fully expressed. Third, awarding labor models became one of the contents of the meeting, making labor models the backbone of the meeting and the most active members. After evaluation and awards, a challenge competition was naturally launched. Fourth, after eliminating the ideological concerns of the masses, they were required to acquire new knowledge in science and technology. For example, Xuanhua, Datong, Yingxian, and Hunyuan counties all actually experimented with techniques such as seed soaking, seed dressing, and germination, creating a warm atmosphere for exchanging experiences and learning techniques.
    Regarding the implementation of the plan: By the end of February, all special districts, Zhangjiakou and Datong cities, and Xuanhua and other counties had submitted the 1950 agricultural production plan to the province for review. Their common points were: (1) They all grasped the spirit of focusing on increasing grain production, and they were very confident, estimating that the total grain production would increase by 3,556,000 shi, exceeding the province's plan of 3,000,000 shi by 18.5%. (2) They grasped the spirit of achieving increased production through subjective efforts, and had detailed plans and specific measures for fertilizer, seeds, farm tools, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. (3) They initially established the idea of long-term construction, such as emphasizing autumn plowing, green manure, canal construction, dike repair, dam construction, and field seed selection, all of which create conditions for production in 1951.
    The plan also has common shortcomings: (1) Insufficient mastery of information and data, and lack of numerical basis. Therefore, the plan cannot be specific and accurate, and some only vaguely propose "all uncultivated land should be reclaimed" (Zhangjiakou City), "completely restore the wealth of the masses within three to five years," "thoroughly transform smokers and lazy people before spring plowing," and "eliminate all pests before spring plowing" (Chicheng). (2) Insufficient confidence in increasing livestock production. The number of pigs bred in each special district only reached 46% of the provincial plan. The reason is that they do not understand the situation and are not clear about the reproduction rate, so they lack confidence. (3) Zhangjiakou and Datong cities lack technical guidance for afforestation. The afforestation plan totals 1,030,000 trees, only 36.7% of the provincial plan of 2,800,000 trees. Although the afforestation plans of the counties exceeded the provincial plan, they did not improve the guarantee of survival rate.
    In addition, the Chabei Special District convened a meeting of all cadres directly under the special commissioner's office on February 16th, the Yanbei Special District on February 22nd, and the Chanan Special District on March 3rd. In addition to conveying this year's production tasks, the special commissioner and the secretary of the local committee all participated in learning techniques such as seed soaking and seed dressing. At the beginning of March, the Chabei Special District summoned 500 military cadres and teachers from Zhangbei Elementary School to teach seed soaking, seed dressing, and germination techniques, so as to quickly pass them on to the masses, making seed soaking and seed dressing one of the main contents of this year's spring plowing movement. The provincial technology promotion team, divided into three groups, went to Chabei, Chanan, and Yanbei at the end of February to practice seed soaking and seed dressing techniques in conjunction with the people's representative meetings of various counties. The provincial government prepared 82 dozens of thermometers, 25 alcohol meters, and 85 seed dressing machines. In addition, 50,860 jin of Ceresan, 270,000 jin of alcohol, and 60,000 jin of arsenic have been purchased and are being distributed successively. At present, in addition to organizing all cadres to learn warm water seed soaking, alcohol seed dressing, and germination experiments, each special county will train one to three technical extension workers in each village before spring plowing and sowing to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, so that every household will implement seed soaking and seed dressing.

　　察哈尔省贯彻农业生产计划的经验
    中央人民政府农业部
    察哈尔省在农业生产会议的传达、布置与生产计划的贯彻上，获得了不少经验，可供其他地区参考。
    该省大部县份均系经过县代表会议，结合劳动模范、干部、评奖大会传达布置的。最晚于三月二十日传达布置到村。传达布置的经验是：第一、必须有明确的中心。除讨论一九五○年生产计划草案以外，特别是以春耕运动为主，如何解决当地群众迫切要求及特殊需要，反复磋商，使计划成为群众自己的决议。第二、充分发扬民主，检查一九四九年冬季生产工作，一般是采取小组会的方式，使代表意见能充分表达。第三、评奖劳动模范成为会议的内容之一，使劳动模范成为会议的骨干，成为会议中最活动的分子。经过评判奖励后，很自然的掀起挑战竞赛。第四、在群众思想顾虑消除以后，就要求科学技术上取得新的知识，如宣化、大同、应县、浑源等县，都实际试验了浸种、拌种、发芽等技术，造成了交流经验、学习技术的热烈空气。
    关于计划的贯彻：二月底，各专署及张家口、大同两市和宣化等县，将一九五○年农业生产计划均报省审核，其共同点是：（一）都掌握了以增产粮食为主的精神，且信心很高，预计增产粮食总数为三百五十五万六千石，超过省计划三百万石的百分之十八点五。（二）把握了从主观努力达到增产任务的精神，对肥料、籽种、农具、防除病虫害，均有详尽计划和具体措施。（三）初步树立了长期建设的思想，如强调秋耕、压青、开渠、修堤、筑坝以及田间选种等工作，都是给一九五一年生产创造条件。
    计划中也存在着共同的缺点：（一）资料情况掌握不足、缺乏数字根据。因而计划不能具体，不准确，有的只笼统提出《已荒未耕的地全部垦出来》（张市）。“三、五年内完全恢复群众财富”，“春耕前彻底改造烟民懒汉”，“春耕前消灭一切虫害”（赤城）。（二）对增产牲畜信心不足，各专区繁殖猪的数字，仅达省计划的百分之四十六，原因是对情况不了解，对增殖率不清楚，故信心不足。（三）张家口、大同两市缺乏造林技术指导，植树计划共计一百零三万株，仅达省计划二百八十万株的百分之三十六点七。各县植树计划虽超过省计划，但均未提高成活率的保证。
    此外，察北专区于二月十六日，燕北专区于二月二十二日，察南专区于三月三日，均召开专署直属机关全体干部会议，除传达本年生产任务以外，自专员、地委书记均无例外的全体学习浸种、拌种等技术。而察北专区于三月初召集五百部队干部及张北小学教员，传授浸种、拌种发芽技术，以便通过他们迅速传授到群众中去，使浸种、拌种成为今年春耕运动的主要内容之一。省技术推广队分三组，已于二月底分赴察北、察南、雁北结合各县人民代表会议练习浸种、拌种技术。省府准备的温度表八十二打，酒精表二十五支，拌种器八十五个。另外购有赛力散五万零八百六十斤，酒精二十七万斤，砒霜六万斤，正在陆续分发中。现各专县除组织全体干部学习温汤浸种、酒拌种、发芽试验等技术外，并于春耕播种前每村训练一至三个技术推广员，进行深入宣传动员，作到家家户户实行浸种拌种。
