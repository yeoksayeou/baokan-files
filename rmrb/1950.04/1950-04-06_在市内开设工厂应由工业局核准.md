Setting Up Factories in the City Must Be Approved by the Bureau of Industry

    Question: We want to establish a factory in the Beijing area to manufacture sulfur and calcium carbide. Funding is not a problem, but we do not know which authority to contact to handle the factory establishment procedures, and who the sales target for the finished products is. Please reply.
                                            Yao Shaotang
    Answer: Any party intending to establish a factory must apply for registration with the Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and can only operate after approval and issuance of a license. Regarding the manufacture of calcium carbide, there is already one factory in the city, Jianye Calcium Carbide Steel Plant. Due to the cost being higher than the selling price of calcium carbide from the Northeast, it has now stopped manufacturing calcium carbide and specializes in steel casting. As for sulfur manufacturing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has established management regulations, and applications can be made separately to the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of Industry.

　　在市内开设工厂应由工业局核准
    问：我们想在北京区内创设制造硫磺、电石的工厂，一切经费没有问题，可是不知向何机关接洽办理设厂手续，及成品销路对象是谁，请答复。
                                            姚绍棠
    答：凡拟设立工厂，必须在市人民政府工业局申请登记，经核准发照后，才能营业。关于制造电石，本市原有建业电石铸钢厂一户，由于成本高于东北电石的售价，现在已经停止制造电石，专门铸钢。至于硫磺制造，北京市人民政府定有管理办法，可到公安、工业两局分别申请。
