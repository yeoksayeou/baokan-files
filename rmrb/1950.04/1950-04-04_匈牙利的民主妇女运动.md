　　The Democratic Women's Movement in Hungary
    Translated by Qi Yu
    Since Hungary's liberation in 1945, the "women's movement" which was under the protection of the old, feudal fascist regime has been swept away; replacing it is a brand-new democratic women's movement, led by the "Hungarian Democratic Women's League" (hereinafter referred to as "the Women's League"). The purpose of the Women's League is to unite anti-fascist women on the same democratic front to serve the new society.
    The Hungarian Women's League has planned and organized various working groups throughout the country to help clean up the damaged areas and promote social welfare, establishing nurseries and other welfare institutions in various places. In Budapest, the capital of Hungary, in order to resist the plague and prevent its spread, they also organized to inspect the local sanitation equipment and carry out vaccinations for residents. Thus, due to the urgent social need for their help, the work of the Women's League became more active. Within two or three years, hundreds of children's playgrounds, nurseries, maternity homes, and nursing homes were established. The Women's League also organized mobile clinics to provide services throughout the country; countless children's teeth were cared for by them; and millions of people living in remote rural areas received fluoroscopy examinations during the anti-tuberculosis campaign.
    It was not an easy task to unite the masses of women in the same camp. Reactionaries tried their best to attack this broad democratic united front. The parties in the coalition government had agreed not to establish any separate women's organizations outside the Women's League. However, the right-wing elements of the Social Democratic Party disregarded the agreement, strictly prohibited the party's female activists from participating in the work of the Women's League, and re-established the old "Women's Committee." Although they criticized the work of the Women's League, the "Women's Committee" itself could not put forward a concrete work plan, so it never carried out any activities and had no influence. Reactionaries in the church also exerted pressure on women's religious groups to prevent women from participating in the work of the Women's League. All these facts hindered the development of women's work.
    However, there were also parties that supported the Women's League. In the coalition government, the Communist Party and the Peasants' Party expressed their support for the organization as soon as the Women's League was established. The Peasants' Party allowed its female members to participate in the Women's League, and the Communist Party also helped the Women's League promote its work in all aspects, believing that a united women's movement was of considerable political importance. In addition, the women's organizations of two other peasant groups also cooperated with the Women's League. They were often the main members of the Women's League's activities in the countryside. They only had their own women's movement in the economic problems of the peasants and the enlightenment of rural women, and otherwise followed the Women's League. Also, the Railway Employees' Dependents Association for the Protection of Families, established in February 1948 (with the participation of 160,000 railway employees' wives), although organizationally unrelated to the Women's League, actually followed the Women's League.
    Although the pressure from the reactionaries still existed, the Women's League grew larger. The work was more on track, and the organization was more complete. The working groups in the countryside were led by the district secretariats, and the district and city secretariats were led by the National Committee. Many departments of the National Committee that formulated national work plans also participated in planning the election of Women's League cadres.
    The economic and political progress of the democratic system destroyed all obstacles on the road to the women's solidarity movement. It became more obvious in political life that only consolidating the power of the people could guarantee the peace and happiness of the country. And when the Social Democratic Party and the Smallholders Party cleaned up the reactionaries within the party, women understood that only by working together in the same camp could they complete the task.
    When the second congress of the Women's League was held, in addition to the members of the Women's League, various political parties also participated in the meeting. Women from various social and religious groups also participated in the Women's League in the name of formal representatives of the groups to discuss organizational issues. Although women's groups from the Catholic and Unitarian denominations did not send representatives to the meeting, women from other units—Social Democratic Party, Smallholders Party, Women's Trade Union, Railway Workers' Dependents Association, etc.—declared at the meeting that they would join the Women's League. Other women's movements were dissolved, and their members joined the Women's League one by one.
    In 1945, the Women's League joined the International Democratic Women's Federation, and the Hungarian Women's League is a very active member. Today, the reputation of the Women's League has also increased due to its good performance; it is already a unified, united, and powerful women's organization, and its work in all aspects has become more important. In the world democratic movement, she is an important member; for the new Hungary, it has also become a necessary institution, playing a great role in the construction process.

　　匈牙利的民主妇女运动
    其玉译
    自从一九四五年匈牙利获得解放以来，一直在古老的、封建的法西斯政权庇护下的“妇女运动”被一扫而光；替代它的是个崭新的民主妇女运动，领导这崭新的运动的便是“匈牙利民主妇女联盟”（以下简称“妇联”）。妇联的宗旨在于联合反法西斯的妇女们站在同一条民主战线上，为新社会服务。
    匈牙利妇联在全国各地筹划组织了各种工作团体，来帮助清理各地受破坏的区域，并推行社会福利事业，在各地设立了托儿所和其他福利机构。在匈牙利首都布达佩斯，她们为了抵抗瘟疫，防止它的传播，还组织起来检查当地的各项卫生设备，及为居民施行防疫注射等。这样，由于社会迫切需要她们的帮忙，妇联的工作便更活跃起来。二、三年之内数百所儿童乐园、托儿所、产妇之家、养老院，都建立起来了。妇联还组织了流动诊疗所，在全国巡回服务；无数儿童的牙齿受过她们的照料；千万个远居在乡间的人民在防痨运动期间受到了透视检查。
    要将妇女群众都联合在同一阵营里并不是件容易的事。反动派曾尽力打击这广泛的民主统一阵线。联合政府的各党派曾同意不在妇联外再成立任何分散的妇女组织，然而，社会民主党的右翼分子不顾协议，严禁党内妇女的活动分子参加妇联工作，并且重新成立了那个旧有的“妇女委员会”。虽然他们对于妇联的工作大加批评，“妇女委员会”本身却连一个具体的工作计划都提不出来，所以一直没有开展过什么活动，也起不了什么影响。教会里的反动分子也在妇女的宗教团体里施行压力，阻止妇女们参加妇联工作。这种种事实都阻碍了妇女工作的发展。
    可是，也有支持妇联的党派。在联合政府里，共产党和农民党便是在妇联一成立时就表示支持这个组织的。农民党准许它的女党员参加妇联，共产党也在各方面都帮助妇联推进工作，认为一个团结的妇女运动在政治上是有相当的重要性的。另外还有两个农民团体的妇女组织也和妇联进行合作，她们往往是妇联在乡村里活动的团体中的主要分子。她们只有在农民的经济问题和启发农村妇女的工作上，有她们自己的妇女运动，此外都是追随着妇联的。还有，一九四八年二月成立的铁路员工眷属保卫家庭协会（参加者有十六万名铁路员工的妻子），虽然在组织上是和妇联不相关的，实际上也是跟随着妇联的。
    虽然反动派的压力仍存在，但妇联却发展得更庞大了。工作更上轨道，组织也更加完善。乡村里的工作团体受区书记处领导，区和市的书记处则受全国委员会的领导。全国委员会中制定国家工作计划的许多部门，也参与计划妇联干部的选举。
    民主制度的经济和政治的进步，摧毁了走向妇女团结运动的大道上的一切障碍。在政治生活方面表现得更加明显的是：只有巩固人民的力量才能保障国家的和平和幸福。而当社会民主党和小地主党进行清除党内的反动分子时，妇女们更了解，只有团结在同一阵营下工作才能完成任务。
    妇联第二届大会开会时，除了妇联的会员以外，各政党也参加了会议。各社会和宗教团体的妇女也都以团体的正式代表的名义参加了妇联，讨论组织问题。虽然天主教和独神教派的妇女团体没有派代表出席那次会议，然而其他各单位的妇女——社会民主党的、小地主党的、妇女工联的、铁道职工眷属会的等等，都在那次会议中宣称要加入妇联。其他的妇女运动都解散了，它们的会员一个一个地参加了妇联。
    一九四五年，妇联加入了国际民主妇女组织，匈牙利妇联是极活动的一分子。今天，妇联的声望也由于它工作的良好表现而增高了；它已是一个统一的、团结的、强大的妇女组织，各方面的工作也更显得重要了。在世界民主运动中，她是重要的一员；对于新匈牙利，它也成了必要的一个机构，在建设过程中发挥着极大的作用。
