Promoting Sanitary Construction: Citizens Propose Plans
To the Editor:

　　We saw the Beijing Municipal Government's work plan for 1950 in the newspaper, and it is clear that municipal construction is serving the broad masses of the people; especially in the area of public health, it significantly considers the interests of the working people. Therefore, with excitement, we have drafted a plan for the sanitary construction of our area for the government's reference.

　　Our plan is as follows:

　　1. Sewers: Our area mostly has dirt roads, making it very inconvenient to dispose of sewage, and drainage is difficult whenever it rains, often leading to water accumulation like rivers. For example, the east end of Yong'an Road is often covered in mud during rain, obstructing traffic. This is due to the lack of sewers or the blockage of existing sewers. Therefore, the sewers at three locations—the east end of Renmin Road, the east end of Yong'an Road, and the south end of the south alley of Yong'an Road—should be repaired; and two new sewers should be built in the middle of Yong'an Road and the west end of Yong'an Road.

　　2. Public Toilets: The toilets here are almost all dilapidated and filthy, with crooked cesspools and leaking urinals inside, and urine-soaked ground outside, breeding mosquitoes and flies in the summer, and emitting a foul odor. To improve environmental hygiene and inspire improvements in private public toilets, we hope to build a "model public toilet for men and women" (refer to the men's and women's public toilets in Xicheng, Zhao Dengyu Road, west entrance of Baozi Hutong) on the triangular government land at the south end of Yong'an Road, Wanming Road (this is a transportation hub, a five-way intersection, with many pedestrians). We guarantee rapid completion under the principle of public assistance for civilian construction. In addition, the public toilet in the middle of Yong'an Road lacks a sewer to drain urine, resulting in urine-soaked ground all year round, which is detrimental to hygiene; at the same time, the roof is damaged. If this public toilet is moved to the triangular government land, the current owner of the toilet, Chen Ruiyan, can still bear a portion of the construction costs.

　　3. Additional Water Faucets: It is extremely inconvenient to get water in the Waiwushouchang Street area, Yong'an Road diagonal street, and other places. We hope to set up a retail water station each at around No. 39 Yong'an Road, the middle of Shouchang Road, and Yong'an Road South Alley to solve the drinking water problem for local citizens.

### 推进卫生建设  市民提出计划

　　推进卫生建设  市民提出计划编辑同志：
    我们在报上看到了北京市政府一九五○年的工作计划，很明显地看出市政建设，是为广大人民服务的；尤其是在公共卫生部分，更显著的照顾着劳动人民的利益。所以我们带着兴奋的心情对于我们这里的卫生建设拟出一个计划，给政府参考。
    我们的计划是这样的：
    一、下水道：我们这里多是土马路，倒秽水很不方便，且每到下雨时，排水比较困难，往往有流积成河的现象。例如，永安路东头，在下雨时就时常满街水泥，妨碍交通。这是因为缺少下水道，或下水道淤塞的缘故。所以这应当修理人民路、永安路东头、永安路南巷南头三处下水道；新建永安路中间及永安路西头两处下水道。
    二、公共厕所：这里的厕所几乎全是破烂污秽的，厕所内粪坑歪斜，尿池淤漏，厕所外尿泥满地，夏季蚊蝇滋生，臭气难闻。为了增进环境卫生和启发私人公厕的改进，我们希望在永安路、万明路南头三角官地（这里是交通要道，五路交点，行人很多）增设一“男女模范公厕”（参照西城，赵登禹路，报子胡同西口之男女公厕修建即可），我们保证在民修公助原则下迅速完成。此外，永安路中间的公厕没有臭水沟排尿，终年尿泥满地，有碍卫生；同时屋顶已坏，如将此公厕迁至三角官地，厕所本主陈瑞严尚可负担一部修建费。
    三、自来水添设：外五寿长街一带永安路斜街等地，吃水极感不便。我们希望在永安路三九号左右、寿长路中间、永安路南巷等地，各设一零售水站，以解决当地市民的吃水问题。
