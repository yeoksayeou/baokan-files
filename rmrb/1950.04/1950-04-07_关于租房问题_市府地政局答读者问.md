　　On Rental Housing Issues: Municipal Land Administration Bureau Answers Readers' Questions
    Wang Wenlin, Dong Ru, and others: The Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau responds to your inquiries and suggestions as follows:

    I. Regarding the delegation of district offices or police stations to find housing for renters, it is not appropriate both in terms of the current streamlined district office and police station structure, the heavy workload, and the lack of manpower, as well as in terms of the government's current urban housing policy.

    II. To facilitate citizens' renting of housing, the government has made preliminary plans to handle the introduction of rental housing matters after the city's real estate exchange expands its business.

　　关于租房问题  市府地政局答读者问
    王文琳、东如诸君：您们的询问及建议由北京市人民政府地政局答复如下：
    一、关于委托区公所或派出所代租房人找房一节，无论就现在区公所及派出所机构精简，事务繁杂，人力有所未逮，且就政府目前城市房屋政策等方面来说也有未妥。
    二、为谋取市民租房便利，政府曾作初步计划，准备俟本市城区房地产交易所业务扩展后，兼办介绍租赁房屋事项。
