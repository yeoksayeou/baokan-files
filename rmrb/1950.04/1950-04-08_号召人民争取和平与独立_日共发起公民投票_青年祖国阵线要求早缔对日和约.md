　　Youth Fatherland Front Demands Early Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan
Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, Akahata (Red Flag), is launching a nationwide referendum movement to call on the Japanese people to strive for peace and independence. According to a United Press report from Tokyo, the April 6th edition of Akahata carried ballots for the referendum, leaving blank spaces for voters to fill in their names and addresses. The ballots were printed with: "I vote in favor of peace and independence, and I demand that the Diet immediately take measures based on the following points: (1) I do not want Japan to become a battlefield or myself to be used as cannon fodder, nor do I want to be bombed by atomic bombs; (2) I do not want Yokosuka and other places to become military bases; (3) I do not want Japan to become a colony and be enslaved for the benefit of foreign capital; (4) I do not want our peaceful industry to be turned into war industry, and destroy my life; (5) For the sake of our national independence, I demand the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and the early withdrawal of the occupying forces."

　　Akahata stated: The same blank ballots printed by the newspaper are now being distributed by labor unions and democratic organizations throughout Japan. The referendum and the three-month campaign to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty, launched by Japanese democratic groups, will both end on June 30th. It is estimated that more than seven million votes will be collected by then.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 4th, the organization of the Japanese Unified Youth Front – the Japanese Youth Fatherland Front – will hold its founding conference from April 21st to 23rd. The Front's preparatory committee issued a letter to the youth of Japan on the 4th, calling on all patriotic youth in Japan to strive for peace and national independence, to exert their full energy to fight against attempts to turn the motherland into a powder keg and the entire people into cannon fodder. The letter also denounced Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's policy of undermining the people's livelihood, turning Japan into a permanent military base for a new war, and driving Japan into the worst colonial slavery in history. The letter to the youth put forward the following ten slogans: (1) Conclude a comprehensive peace treaty as soon as possible, and immediately withdraw all occupying forces after the treaty is concluded. (2) Oppose the establishment of military bases that will make the Japanese people cannon fodder. (3) Oppose the manufacture and transportation of munitions to kill Asian brothers and disrupt world peace. (4) Defend peace. Guarantee reasonable wages. (5) Democratize workplaces. (6) Ensure that farmers are not harmed by food imports and heavy taxes. (7) Abolish enslaving education and colonial culture. Oppose discrimination against Japanese ethnic minorities. (8) Establish the Youth Fatherland Front. (9) Cooperate with peaceful youth forces around the world. (10) Overthrow the traitorous Yoshida Cabinet.
