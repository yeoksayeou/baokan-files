    Vancouver Sailors and Chinese Workers Oppose Loading American-Made Tanks to Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] Canadian sailors in Vancouver and local Chinese workers opposed Canadian ships carrying American-made tanks to aid the Kuomintang remnants. According to a Telepress Vancouver dispatch on the 4th, before the Canadian Montreal Company's "Argoon," which was loading 75 American-made army tanks for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, set sail for Taiwan late at night on March 23rd, forty Vancouver sailors and Chinese workers organized pickets and demonstrations on the docks. In the picket line, Canadian sailors, Chinese workers, and unemployed people held signs that read: "No interference in China," "Don't support Butcher Chiang Kai-shek," "Peaceful trade with New China," etc. The Vancouver Peace Congress, the British Columbia Provincial Federation of Labour, and many progressive and Communist organizations have all denounced this arms transport.
