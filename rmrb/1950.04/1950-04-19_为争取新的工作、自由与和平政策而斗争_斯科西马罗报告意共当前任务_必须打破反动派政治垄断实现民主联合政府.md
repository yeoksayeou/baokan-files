Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th – According to a report from Teletype Agency Rome: Italian Communist Party Central Committee member and Senator Scoccimarro delivered a major report entitled "Striving for New Policies of Work, Freedom, and Peace" at the Italian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session on the 14th. In his report, he first pointed out that the Italian government, under the pressure of reactionary forces, the highest Catholic authorities, and U.S. imperialism, has moved towards a police state employing unconstitutional emergency measures and provocative repressive tactics. This is because a major adventure to wage war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is only possible if the strong political and trade union organizations of the workers are eliminated.

The report continued: At the current stage of the development of the Italian political situation, it is necessary to avoid engaging in immature struggles and falling into the trap of provocation; but at the same time, it is also necessary to organize non-violent resistance movements against the government's illegal measures and continue to fight for the major goals facing the workers: "Work, Land, Peace." Communists should calmly and prudently study the situation. Because we are strong, and the spirit of the masses is heroic, we must carefully formulate a set of methods for engaging in the current political struggle. It should be remembered that the struggle will develop forward over a long period and cannot be resolved by a few decisive battles.

When discussing the nature of the struggle, Scoccimarro stated: It would be a mechanistic error to think that the struggle is either offensive or defensive, and that one must choose only one. In such a complex situation as the present, the actions of the masses are simultaneously offensive and defensive, attacking in one place and defending in another. We must hold all our positions while seizing new ones. In our observation, the current situation will not be a large, decisive battle, but rather a long series of struggles, a series of battles between peaceful forces and war forces under a variety of conditions.

Scoccimarro pointed out some of the party's current tasks: First, we must develop and expand the front of struggle and isolate the enemy. We must improve and strengthen our policy of working-class unity. We must implement a broad alliance policy to perfect our policy of uniting democratic forces. Second, it is necessary to eliminate the remnants of sectarianism that still remain within the party. At the same time, it is also necessary to concentrate actions to maintain the political initiative that the enemy is trying to take from us; the initiative remains, and must continue to remain, in the hands of the working class.

After pointing out some mistakes made in leading the struggle due to lack of experience and misjudgment, Scoccimarro emphasized that it is necessary to carry out discussions, criticism, and self-criticism within the party, strengthen vigilance against the enemy infiltrating the party, and be wary of provocateurs, unreliable elements, and corrupt elements. He said: Strengthening ideological leadership is the most effective tool for strengthening the party's vigilance.

Scoccimarro concluded by declaring: The future struggles will revolve around the following basic needs of the Italian people: a policy of peace and national independence, a policy of economic recovery based on the "Work Plan" formulated by the General Confederation of Labor, the implementation of the social principles in the Constitution, and the elimination of fascism and anti-communism. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to break the political monopoly of the Christian Democrats and strive to achieve a broad democratic coalition government.

　　“为争取新的工作、自由与和平政策而斗争”
    斯科西马罗报告意共当前任务
    必须打破反动派政治垄断实现民主联合政府
    【新华社十八日讯】据电通社罗马消息：意大利共产党中央委员、上议员斯科西马罗在意共中央委员会全会十四日会议上，作了题为“为争取新的工作、自由与和平政策而斗争”的主要报告。他在报告中首先指出：意大利政府在反动势力、天主教最高当权集团和美帝国主义的压力下，已经走向了一个采用违反宪法的非常措施并施行挑衅镇压手段的警察统治。因为只有在消灭了强有力的工人的政治组织和工会组织的条件下，才有可能进行对苏联及人民民主国家作战的大冒险。
    报告继称：在意大利政局发展的目前阶段下，避免从事未成熟的斗争而落入挑衅的圈套，是必要的；但同时，组织反对政府非法措施的非武力反抗运动，并继续为摆在工人面前的重大目标“工作、土地、和平”而斗争，也是必要的。共产党人应该冷静沉着研究局势。因为我们是强大的，群众的精神是英勇的，我们就必须细心形成一套从事目前政治斗争的方法。应当切记：斗争将在长时期中向前发展，不是少数几次决战就可以解决的。
    斯科西马罗在谈到斗争的性质时称：认为斗争不是攻势就是守势，只能选择其一，就会犯机械主义的错误。在像目前这样复杂的局势下，人民群众的行动同时是攻势的也是守势的，在一个地方进攻，而在另一个地方防守。我们必须坚守我们的一切阵地，而同时攻取新的阵地。据我们的观察，目前形势将不是有一个大的决定性的战斗，而是一长串的斗争，一系列在多种多样的条件下进行的和平力量对战争力量的战斗。
    斯科西马罗指出党当前的某些任务称：我们首先必须开展和扩大斗争阵线，孤立敌人。我们必须改进和加强我们的工人阶级团结的政策。我们必须施行一个广泛的联盟政策，以使我们的民主力量团结起来的政策，臻于完善。第二，必须消除仍残留在党内的宗派主义残余。同时还必要集中行动，以保持敌人力图从我们手里夺去的政治主动性，主动仍保持在而且必须继续保持在工人阶级手里。
    斯科西马罗在指出领导斗争中所犯的某些因缺少经验、和估计失当而犯的错误后，着重指出必须在党内开展讨论、批评及自我批评，加强警惕敌人打入党内，警惕挑拨分子、不可靠分子和腐化分子。他说：加强思想领导是加强党的警觉性的最有效的工具。
    斯科西马罗结语宣称：今后的斗争将围绕着下述意大利人民的基本需要：和平与国家独立的政策，根据总工会制定的“工作计划”而制定的经济复兴的政策，实行宪法中的社会原则，肃清法西斯主义和反共主义。为实现这些目标，必须打破基督教民主党的政治垄断，力争实现一个广泛的民主联合政府。
