　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: Soviet Sinologist, Ledorenko, recently reported at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the dissemination and popularity of Soviet literature in China, stating: Soviet literature has always been read and studied by Chinese readers with great enthusiasm. Chinese people's leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai have both emphasized the great contribution of Soviet literature in China. The works of Soviet writers describing the heroic figures of the Great Patriotic War have encouraged the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to fight for freedom and national independence. Chinese commanders and fighters have also learned the courage and decisiveness, revolutionary morality, and heroism of the Soviet Red Army from the works of writers such as Fadeyev, Sholokhov, and Simonov. Soviet literature has given the reading masses a clear concept of the new social system and new state system of the Soviet Union, as well as the leadership role of the Communist Party in the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. The writers of New China are also inspired by Soviet literature. They have created new works, praising their great people linked to the Soviet people by bonds of eternal friendship. Like Soviet writers, they actively participate in the construction of the new society. The female writer Ding Ling, who participated in the land reform, has written her experiences and observations into the famous book "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River". Writers such as Lu Mei have depicted the life of Chinese textile workers in the play "Red Flag Song." Chinese writers are creating literature to mobilize the people to fight for a democratic New China. To achieve this noble task, they are drawing experience from the Soviet literary treasury.

　　我国广大读者热爱苏联文学
    苏联汉学家谈苏联文学在中国
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：苏联汉学家列多连科，顷在苏联科学院东方学研究所报告苏联文学在中国传播与受欢迎的情形称：苏联文学一直被中国读者以极大的爱好阅读研究着。中国人民领袖毛泽东和周恩来，均曾强调指出苏联文学在中国的伟大贡献。苏联作家描述伟大的爱国战争的英雄人物的著作，曾鼓励了中国人民解放军的战士为自由与民族独立而斗争。中国的指战员们也曾从法捷耶夫、萧洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫等作家的著作中，学习苏联红军的勇气与果敢，革命道德与英雄主义。苏联文学使读者群众对苏联的新社会制度与新国家制度，以及共产党人在苏联的和平建设中的领导作用，有了明确的概念。新中国的作家也受苏联文学的启发。他们已创作了新的著作，歌颂他们被永恒友谊的纽带与苏联人民连结在一起的伟大人民。他们像苏联作家一样地积极参加了新社会的建设。参加了土地改革的女作家丁玲已把她的经验与观察，写成名著“太阳照在桑乾河上”。作家鲁煤等在剧本“红旗歌”中描写了中国纺织工人的生活。中国的作家正在创作动员人民为民主新中国而斗争的文学。为了实现这个高贵的任务，他们正自苏联的文学库藏中汲取经验。
