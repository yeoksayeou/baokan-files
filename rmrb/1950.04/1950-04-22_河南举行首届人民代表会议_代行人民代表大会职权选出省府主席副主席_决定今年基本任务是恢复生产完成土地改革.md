Xinhua News Agency, 19th—The first Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference was held from the 9th to the 15th. With the approval of the Central People's Government, the conference exercised the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress, elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and determined the working principles and tasks for Henan Province in 1950.

The conference believes that the basic tasks for Henan Province in 1950 are: to vigorously restore and develop production, and to basically complete land reform throughout the province, laying a solid foundation for large-scale production and construction in the future. In urban areas, the focus of work should be on continuing to restore and develop production, with emphasis on developing light industry to "support heavy industry with light industry." To this end, it is necessary to maintain and restore existing industries, especially industries and handicrafts that are related to Henan's special products and have development prospects. Factories from other places are welcome to relocate to Henan. Close cooperation between urban and rural areas is needed, supply and marketing cooperatives should be established with a focus, and market management should be strengthened to maintain price stability, absorb idle capital, and support production. In terms of agricultural production, it is imperative to closely integrate with land reform work, maintain and improve the existing production level of grain and industrial raw materials, implement special product reward policies, and fulfill the task assigned by the Central People's Government to increase grain production by 650 million catties and increase cotton planting by 500,000 mu throughout the province. At the same time, efforts should be made to build water conservancy projects, prevent floods and drain water, and implement work-relief programs to help disaster victims. Due to the different rates of development in various parts of the province, the conference pointed out that in areas where land distribution has already begun, all work should be based on the principle of not hindering production; during the busy farming season, the focus should shift to production work. In areas where land distribution has not yet been implemented, efforts should be made to stabilize production relations, earnestly implement policies and regulations such as rent reduction and rent payment, maintaining tenancy relations, ensuring that whoever sows reaps, and protecting the fruits of labor. In areas where land reform has been completed, it is necessary to focus on carrying out a large-scale production movement, defining land rights, improving agricultural burden methods, and conducting education among the masses on becoming prosperous through labor and production. In areas severely affected by famine, it is necessary to deepen the work of overcoming famine through production, implement the policy of self-reliance through production as the main approach, combined with work-relief programs, and lead the people in disaster areas to successfully overcome the spring famine.

The conference enthusiastically discussed the implementation of land reform throughout the province and decided to complete all land reform work before the spring plowing of 1951. Before the wheat harvest this year, efforts should be made to complete it in the 42 counties where land distribution has already begun, and the remaining areas should be completed after the autumn harvest and before the spring plowing of next year. The conference adopted the Land Reform Regulations formulated by the Henan Provincial People's Government and stipulated specific work steps and methods. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously expressed their full support for the implementation of land reform and guaranteed its effective implementation.

The conference also conducted a detailed discussion on the province's financial and economic issues, adopted the Henan Province's 1950 financial revenue and expenditure plan, and formulated a resolution on implementing the State Council's "Decision on Unified Financial and Economic Work."

After full deliberation and consultation, the conference elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and 42 members of the Provincial People's Government in a democratic manner, and submitted them to the Central People's Government for approval and appointment. The conference also elected Zhang Xi as the Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultation Committee, Liu Jie, Liu Jixue, Wang Yizhai, and Ren Zhiming as Vice-Chairmen, and 77 members.

　　河南举行首届人民代表会议
    代行人民代表大会职权选出省府主席副主席
    决定今年基本任务是恢复生产完成土地改革
    【新华社十九日讯】河南省首届各界人民代表会议于九日至十五日举行。会议经中央人民政府批准，代行省人民代表大会职权，选出河南省人民政府主席、副主席和委员，决定了河南省一九五○年的工作方针和任务。
    会议认为，河南省一九五○年的基本工作任务是：大力恢复和发展生产，基本上完成全省土地改革工作，为今后大规模的生产建设打下雄厚的基础。在城市方面，应以继续恢复和发展生产为工作中心，着重发展轻工业，做到“以轻养重”。为此，首先要维持和恢复现有工业，特别是与河南特产相联系又有发展前途的工业和手工业，欢迎外地工厂迁豫，密切城乡互助关系，有重点地建立供销合作社，并加强市场管理，保持物价平稳，吸收游资，扶植生产。在农业生产方面，必须与土地改革工作密切结合，保持与提高现有粮食和工业原料的现有生产水平，实行特产奖励政策，完成中央人民政府分配的全省增产粮食六亿五千万斤和增植棉花五十万亩的任务。同时应大力兴修水利，防洪排水，实行以工代赈救济灾民。由于全省各地工作发展速度不同，会议指出：在已开始实行分配土地的地区，一切工作应以不妨碍生产为原则；到农忙季节，则应转入以生产工作为中心。尚未实行分配土地的地区，应努力稳定生产关系，切实执行减租交租、保持租佃关系、谁种谁收、保护劳动所得等政策和规定。土地改革已经完成的地区，必须以开展大生产运动为中心，确定地权，改进农业负担办法，向群众进行劳动生产发家致富的教育。在灾荒严重的地区，必须把生产渡荒工作深入一步，贯彻以生产自救为主，结合以工代赈的方针，领导灾区人民胜利渡过春荒。
    会议热烈地讨论了在全省范围内实行土地改革的问题，决定在一九五一年春耕以前，全部完成土地改革工作。今年麦收前，先在已经开始实行分配土地的四十二个县内求得完成，其余地区于秋收后至明年春耕前完成。会议通过了河南省人民政府制订的土地改革条例，并规定了具体的工作步骤和方法。各界代表一致表示完全拥护实行土地改革工作，并保证其切实执行。
    会议对全省财政经济问题，也作了详细的讨论，通过了河南省一九五○年的财政收支计划，并订出关于贯彻实现政务院“统一财经工作决定”的决议。
    会议经过充分的酝酿与协商，用民主方式选出了省人民政府主席、副主席及省府委员四十二人，呈请中央人民政府批准任命。会议另选出张玺为省各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席，刘杰、刘积学、王毅斋、任芝铭为副主席及委员七十七人。
