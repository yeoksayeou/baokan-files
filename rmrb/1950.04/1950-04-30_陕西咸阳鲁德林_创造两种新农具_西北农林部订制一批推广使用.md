　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th -- Lu Delin, the factory director of the Farm Tool Manufacturing Plant in Diantai District, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, has created two new types of farm tools: the "Delin Seed Drill" and the "Delin Pull Hoe." The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry believes that this invention is a contribution to agricultural production technology and has allocated 790 shi of wheat to the Farm Tool Manufacturing Plant to order 130 Delin Seed Drills and 200 Delin Pull Hoes for promotion. The two new farm tools created by Lu Delin have significant advantages. For example, the Delin Seed Drill can sow 30 to 40 mu of land per day. Its seeding depth is consistent, which can make the seedlings emerge evenly, and it also covers the soil at the same time as seeding, which saves labor and preserves soil moisture. The Delin Pull Hoe uses livestock as power and can hoe 20 mu of land per day, hoeing finely and evenly. At the same time, the machine body is not heavy, and it is easy to move, and it can also avoid the blockage of weeds and soil clods. These two new farm tools are simple in structure and low in cost, making them suitable for promotion. Currently, the Diantai District Farm Tool Manufacturing Plant has completed all 130 Delin Seed Drills ordered by the Northwest Agricultural Department, and they have been transported to the agricultural extension stations in the four districts of Baoji, Weinan, Bin County, and Xianyang for use. The Delin Pull Hoes are also being rushed to be manufactured and are expected to be ready for use during weeding.

　　陕西咸阳鲁德林
    创造两种新农具
    西北农林部订制一批推广使用
    【新华社西安二十八日电】陕西省咸阳县钓台区农具制造厂厂长鲁德林，创造出“德林条播机”和“德林拉锄机”两种新式农具。西北军政委员会农林部认为该项创造对于农业生产技术是一个贡献，刻已拨出麦子七百九十市石交给该农具制造厂，订制德林条播机一百三十架、德林拉锄机二百架，以备推广。鲁德林所创造的两种新式农具，都有它显著的优点，如德林条播机每天可种地三十至四十亩，它的下种深度一致，可使苗出得整齐，并且在下种时又同时进行盖土，这样既可省工，又能保持土中水分。德林拉锄机以牲口做动力，每天可锄地二十亩，锄得又细又平；同时机身重量不大，移动轻便，还能避免杂草和土块的壅塞。这两种新式农具构造简单、成本甚低，宜于推广。现钓台区农具制造厂已将西北农林部所定的德林条播机一百三十架全部制成，并分别由宝鸡、渭南、邠县、咸阳四个分区的农业推广站运去使用。德林拉锄机也正在赶制中，预计能赶上耘草时应用。
