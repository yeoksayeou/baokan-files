　　Organizing Small Producer Supply and Marketing Cooperatives: Shijiazhuang Achieves Preliminary Results
    [Our Dispatch] Shijiazhuang City has achieved preliminary results in organizing supply and marketing cooperatives for small producer industries. As of the end of February this year, six industry supply and marketing cooperatives have been established for the shoe, oil, flax spinning, cotton weaving, leather, and wood and tile industries, organizing and driving the production of forty-five production units, totaling 1,233 members, and business is gradually expanding.
    Based on the preliminary experience of two years of trial implementation, the following issues must be noted:
    First, organization must be carried out with a focus, selecting industries that are necessary for industry, agriculture, and the broad masses of working people, and that cannot be replaced by machine production in the short term, and on which a considerable number of people rely for their livelihood. Organize these first.
    For example, the six production industry supply and marketing cooperatives organized last year and the four production industry supply and marketing cooperatives that have been decided to be organized first this year, namely wrought iron, galvanized iron, bricks and tiles, and manure, are based on this experience.
    Second, ensure an adequate supply of raw materials and open up channels for the sale of finished products. On this issue, it is mainly necessary to rely on state-owned enterprises to supply raw materials, purchase finished products, or order processing. Carry out long-distance purchasing and sales, and when necessary, also need to plan to use peddlers and warehouses (such as the sesame seeds of the oil industry cooperative, which must be purchased from afar; the yarn of the cotton weaving cooperative, which must rely on the yarn and cloth company for supply). In terms of funds, in addition to concentrating members' shares and accumulating funds in operation to accelerate turnover, appropriate subsidies from higher-level cooperatives and state banks are also necessary. Especially in the off-season, appropriate assistance is needed.
    Finally, an important issue is that in order for small producer supply and marketing cooperatives to develop forward, attention must be paid to the improvement of tools and production methods, so that they can gradually move towards advanced machine production.

　　组织小生产者供销社  石市已获得初步成绩
    【本报讯】石家庄市组织小生产者行业供销合作社已得到初步成绩。截至今年二月底，已成立了鞋业、油业、纺麻、棉织、皮革、木瓦等六个行业供销合作社，组织带动了四十五个生产单位，计一千二百三十三个社员的生产，业务尚在逐步扩大。
    根据两年来试办中的初步体验，须注意以下几个问题：
    首先，必须有重点的进行组织，选择为工农业和广大劳动人民所必需，并又在短期内不可能为机器生产所代替又为相当多的群众赖以为生的行业。先把它组织起来。
    如去年组织的六个生产行业供销社以及今年决定先组织的熟铁、洋铁、砖瓦、大粪四个生产行业供销社便是根据这个经验进行的。
    其次，保证原料的充分供给和打开成品的销路的问题。在这个问题上，又主要要依靠国营企业供给原料收购成品，或订货加工。并进行远地采购推销，必要时尚须有计划的利用小贩和货栈（如油业社的芝麻，必须远地采购；棉织社的纱，必须依靠花纱布公司供给）。又在资金上，除集中社员股金以及在经营中积累资金加速周转外，上级社和国家银行给予适当补助，也是必要的。特别在淡月更需要有适当的帮助。
    最后，一个重要的问题，就是要使小生产者供销合作社能向前发展，就须注意工具与生产方式的改进，使之能逐渐走向进步的机器生产。
