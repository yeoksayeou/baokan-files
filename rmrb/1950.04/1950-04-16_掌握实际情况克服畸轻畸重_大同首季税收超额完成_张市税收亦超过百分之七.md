　　【Our Newspaper】Datong City's tax revenue for the first quarter, thanks to the active efforts of all tax workers, has also been exceeded. The original total task for the first quarter was 24,671 *shi* of millet, but the actual collection was 26,848 *shi*, exceeding the original task by 2,177 *shi*. The reasons for this achievement are primarily: first, based on the evaluation of scores from last year, the burden-bearing households and the burden amount of each household were appropriately adjusted according to the current specific situation, correcting the past phenomenon of uneven burdens. Appropriate reductions and exemptions were granted to those with genuine difficulties. Second, the three major industries of hotels, shipping stores, and transshipment were grasped, ensuring the smooth progress of collection. In addition, the strengthening of inspection work played a significant role in transaction and stamp taxes. For example, the Nangguan Tax Office used to collect 200,000 yuan in stamp tax daily, but after a general survey, it increased threefold. Moreover, many speculative merchants evading taxes were uncovered indirectly. In March alone, several major tax evasion cases were uncovered, totaling 5,660,807 yuan in back taxes and 11,027,740 yuan in fines. When evaluating industrial and commercial taxes, accurate and reliable figures were grasped in advance, correcting the empty claims of some merchants about heavy taxes. Furthermore, with the exception of banks and bookstores, which are still in the process of declaring and paying business taxes, all other thirteen state-owned enterprises have paid their taxes, totaling 251,408,379 yuan, equivalent to 259,044 *jin* of millet.

    【Our Newspaper】According to a report in the Chahar Daily on April 11th: Zhangjiakou City's tax revenue for the first quarter (industrial and commercial taxes only include January and February) has exceeded the original target by six percent. The main reasons for this achievement are: First, conscientious study of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's successively issued decisions regarding fiscal and tax revenues, and the editorials of this newspaper, enabled the vast majority of comrades to transform their erroneous perception of tax work as "undignified," which resulted in a cheerful and active attitude in their work. For example, in the Xishahe Tax Office, the comrades engaged in field work, especially Zhu Biru and Liu Piji, did not return a single day without discovering problems or achieving results. When Liu Piji investigated the Fuyi Public *Dou* Bureau, he not only found untaxed cloth in the counter, but also seized a bundle of cloth placed on the roof. Comrades engaged in internal work, when busy, skipped lunch for two or three days. In particular, Comrade Feng Shaofeng created a record of writing two hundred and forty copies of commodity tax tickets in a single day, demonstrating extreme enthusiasm for work. Second, the dynamic development of tax sources based on changes in market conditions. For example, the original plan of the Xishahe Tax Office was to mainly collect grain and livestock transaction taxes, but during this season, the amount of grain and livestock on the market was very small, equivalent to only one-third of the same period last year, resulting in a sharp decline in tax sources. In order to ensure the completion of the tax revenue task, the office flexibly extracted seven people into three groups to inspect merchant tax, stamp tax, etc., so that the rubber tire merchants, who had not been managed throughout the previous year, were not only universally registered, but also plugged loopholes, greatly increasing the tax source. It not only completed the task, but also exceeded it by seven percent.

    The private industrial and commercial taxes in January and February initially showed procrastination in various industries when collection began on February 21st. Since the announcement on March 20th that "a late payment surcharge will be levied for overdue payments," the various industrial and commercial households were transformed for fear of being penalized. For example, before the announcement of the late payment surcharge, from February 21st to March 20th, only two-thirds of the total tax revenue was completed in a month. In the seven days after the announcement, nearly two-thirds were completed. However, some industries did lack cash due to irregular business and sluggish business, and could not pay on time, such as the beef and mutton industry, sewing industry, cart industry, inn industry, and pasta industry.

    In addition, the collection of private industrial and commercial taxes in Zhangjiakou City in March was arranged at the joint meeting of the directors of various industry associations on April 2nd. Because the city-wide investigation and evaluation work is still in progress and has not yet ended, the burden is still levied according to the old score. April 18th is the deadline for tax payment, and those who fail to pay overdue will be charged a late payment surcharge of 3% per day.

　　掌握实际情况克服畸轻畸重
    大同首季税收超额完成
    张市税收亦超过百分之七
    【本报讯】大同市第一季税收，经过全体税务工作人员的积极努力亦已超额完成。原订第一季总任务为小米二四、六七一石，现共征收起二六、八四八石，超过原任务二、一七七石。其完成原因首先是由于根据了去年评论的分数基础，按目前具体情况适当调整了负担户与各户负担数，纠正了过去畸轻畸重的现象，对确有困难者，并予适当减免。其次是掌握了旅店、发货店、转运三个大的行业，保证征收的顺利进行。另外是稽查工作的加强，在交易、印花税方面，起了很大作用；如南关税务所过去每日收印花税二十万元，经普查后即增加三倍。并从侧面查出不少投机商人漏税，仅三月份就查出几宗大的漏税，共计补税五、六六○、八○七元，罚金共一一、○二七、七四○元。在评议工商税时由于事先掌握了实际可靠数字，纠正了某些商人中的空喊税重。又各公营企业营业税，现除银行、书店正在申报交纳外，其余十三个单位都已交清，共交款二五一、四○八、三七九元，折米二五九、○四四斤。

    【本报讯】据四月十一日察哈尔日报消息：张家口市第一季税收（工商业税只包括一、二两月份）已超过原任务的百分之六。获得这样成绩的主要原因：一、认真学习了中央人民政府政务院连续发布的有关财政税收的决定和本报社论，绝大部分同志在思想上转变了作税务工作“不体面”的错误认识，因此在工作上表现了愉快和积极。如西沙河税务所，作外勤工作的同志特别是朱璧如、刘丕基两同志，没有一天不发现问题或没有成绩而归。刘丕基在查福义公斗局时，不仅从柜房里查出未税的布匹，且将放在顶棚上的一捆布也查获了。作内勤工作的同志，在工作忙的时候，两三天都不吃午饭，特别是冯绍峰同志创造了一天写两联的货物税票二百四十张，工作热忱极高。二、根据市场情况的变化，机动的开辟税源，如西沙河税务所原定计划是以征收粮食、牲畜交易税为主，但在这一季节里粮食与牲畜上市量很少，只相当于去年同一时期的三分之一，使税源锐减。该所为了保证税收任务的完成，就机动的抽出七人编为三组，稽查行商税、印花税等，使去年一年中没有管理起来的胶皮轮带行商，不仅普遍进行了登记，且堵塞了漏洞，使税源大增，不但完成了任务，而且超过了百分之七。
    一、二月份的私营工商税，在二月二十一日开征的初期，各行业均表现拖拉；自三月二十日宣布：“逾期不缴者加征滞纳金”以后，各工商户惟恐受罚才有所转变。如在未宣布加征滞纳金前，自二月二十一日至三月二十日，一个来月仅仅完成了全部税收的三分之二；在宣布后的七天中就完成了将近三分之二。但也有的行业确实因为营业不正规，生意清淡而缺乏现款，不能按期缴纳，如牛羊肉业、缝纫业、大车业、旅栈业、面食业等。
    此外，张市三月份私营工商业税已于四月二日，在各行业公会理事长联席会上布置了开征。因全市调查评议工作正在进行尚未结束，负担量仍按旧分数计征。四月十八日为税款缴纳截止期，逾期不缴者，即按日课以百分之三的滞纳金。
