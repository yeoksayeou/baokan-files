　　Wen'an County Focuses on Key Work Aspects
    Spring Ploughing, River Works, and Sideline Occupations Without Neglect
    The Key is to Organize the Strength of the Masses to Implement Mutual Assistance
    [This newspaper reports] Hebei's Wen'an County leadership closely integrates the masses' spring ploughing, spring river works, and sideline production, ensuring that sideline production does not stop, spring ploughing, spring planting, and spring weeding are not delayed, and the first phase of river works is completed. The attainment of this achievement is mainly due to grasping four key aspects: organizing, uniting in mutual assistance, mobilizing women to participate in production, and rectifying land tilling on behalf of others, thereby resolving contradictions and overcoming difficulties.
    Wen'an is a county heavily affected by disasters. Last winter's production, through the concerted efforts of county, district, and village cadres, Party members, and the masses, yielded results and achieved self-salvation. After the distribution of disaster relief loans this spring, in March, the number of people participating in sideline and handicraft production throughout the county reached 71,535, accounting for more than one-third of the county's total population. However, after the thaw, spring ploughing, spring planting (early-maturing crops), and spring weeding (weeding wheat) needed to be started, and the massive river works task was also urgently awaiting commencement, while sideline production could not be stopped. This contradiction intensified daily. Wen'an was originally sparsely populated, and particularly after last year's disaster, manpower fled due to famine, livestock were sold off, and some agricultural implements were sold or damaged, further exacerbating the difficulties. In this emergency, the leadership from the county to the district level initially only emphasized disaster relief and neglected spring ploughing and planting (details can be found in this newspaper's March 18th issue). After the county government and the Wen'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party identified this problem, they paid special attention to resolving these contradictions and difficulties, and researched specific measures three times to instruct each district to earnestly strengthen the specific leadership of spring ploughing and river works. According to statistics as of April 1st, in six districts and 233 villages, 137,991 mu of spring land had been ploughed (including 17,169 mu ploughed twice), accounting for 62% of the area to be ploughed. 56,217 mu of early-maturing crops (spring barley, garlic, sorghum, millet, glutinous millet, grain, spring vegetables, etc.) had been sown. 94,124 mu of wheat fields had been weeded, accounting for 50% of the total. River works commenced on March 27th, and by April 4th, the first phase had been completed, a length of 9,900 meters from Lijiafangzi to Mao'erwan (including two breaches), involving 62,302 cubic meters of earthwork. Sideline production, except for the hide and saltpeter industry due to the cessation of purchasing, had not stopped, and the mat industry had even developed.
    How did Wen'an County grasp these four key aspects?
    Organize Mutual Assistance in Production
    First, the leadership grasped the principle of organization as paramount and conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda. It called for the voluntary formation of labor mutual aid groups, promoted cadres, Party members, and model workers to lead the masses, and county and district cadres started from the small details to provide assistance, and on the basis of existing sideline production mutual aid groups, led the shift to agriculture, sideline occupations, and dike construction combined groups. In general, migrant workers all participated in mutual aid groups or arranged for someone to till their land on their behalf. The proportion of the masses organized into partnerships for mutual assistance in spring ploughing, river works, and sideline production was about two-thirds. The organizational forms were as follows: (1) Mutual aid groups combining agriculture, sideline occupations, and dike construction were established on the basis of sideline production. Forty-eight people in Qinge Village in the Fourth District who were building dikes all participated in mutual aid groups. The mutual aid group led by Communist Party member Wu Jinliang, consisting of seven people, had four people go to build dikes, and three people stay at home to boil saltpeter, etc. (2) Swapping labor to pull the harrows. This was generally organized when there was no livestock, or the livestock was weak, or the land was too wet. Li Tinghe of Dadao Village in the Second District had 10 mu of land to plough and two laborers, but no livestock. Li Yihe had one laborer and one head of livestock. The two families swapped labor; Li Yihe ploughed the land for Li Tinghe, and Li Tinghe hoed the wheat for Li Yihe. There were a total of 12 such groups consisting of 39 households in the village. In Koutou Village in the Fifth District, there were 1,200 mu of land to be planted with early-maturing crops, but because the land was wet, livestock could not enter the fields, and people had to pull the seed drill. Niu Baoshen, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in the village, organized five households to pull the seed drill and plant 50 mu of peas in six days, motivating the entire village to take action. According to statistics from Koutou, Taibaozhuang, and three other villages, there were 40 such partnerships, involving 170 households. (3) Temporary sharing of draft animals. Because of the lack of manpower, livestock, and agricultural implements, it was rare for a household to be able to carry out spring ploughing alone, so this form of mutual assistance was the most common. On March 27th, in Sun Village in the Second District, 169 head of livestock were temporarily combined into 64 groups of three to five households, using a total of 50 plows and 60 harrows to work the land, ploughing 500 mu of land in one day.
    Unite in Friendship and Help Each Other
    Organizing partnerships for mutual assistance could not solve the difficulties for some households, especially those of widows, orphans, the elderly, the disabled, and those who had fled famine. Therefore, it was necessary to educate the masses to unite in friendship and help each other to overcome difficulties. It was advocated to request draft animals and borrow livestock. In Wangjiawu Village in the Second District, 12 households borrowed 12 head of livestock from Shuixiang Village to plough the land. Liu Wenbin borrowed a head of cattle from a relative's home in Caozhuang Village and not only ploughed his own 16 mu of land but also ploughed 20 mu of land for Liu Peiyuan. Li Guangxin of Zhujiawu had 12 mu of land to plough but did not have any livestock himself. He requested two plows (including livestock and people) in his village and only provided meals, and the first round of ploughing was completed in one day. For the land of households that had fled famine, the main thing was to call them back to till the land. If they did not return, village cadres would find someone to till the land on their behalf. In Sun Village in the Second District, there were a total of 140 households that had fled famine (55 households with people at home). Through kinship relations, letters were written to call back 36 households to till the land, and 46 households entrusted their land to the head of the family or a suitable person to till on their behalf. Qi Ruiseng did not return and had 4.5 mu of land, which he entrusted to Zhang Wenzhi to till on his behalf. There were also three households that no one was taking care of, so village cadres found someone to plough and sow the land for them, and the price would be discussed when they returned. For widows, orphans, the disabled, and the elderly, the main thing was to educate them to work themselves or to entrust relatives and friends to help with tilling.
    Fully Mobilize Women to Participate in Spring Ploughing and Weeding
    Fully mobilizing women to participate in field production was one of the ways to solve the shortage of manpower and livestock. The leadership grasped this aspect, so in general early villages, in addition to those participating in various sideline production activities, about 30% to 40% of the total female labor force participated in spring ploughing and weeding. In Sun Village in the Second District, 136 women participated in spring ploughing and weeding, accounting for 40% of the total female labor force. Li Lanrong, Zhang Xiuhua (whose male laborers had fled famine), and two others organized to switch from burning hides to weeding wheat, completing 36 mu of wheat fields out of a total of 50 mu in four days. According to statistics from seven villages including Koutou and Taibaozhuang in the Fifth District, 108 women participated in pulling the seed drill in 91 mutual aid groups.
    Rectify the Tilling on Behalf of the Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Workers
    After the disaster, farmers tilling on behalf of others fled, so the land of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers was not being tilled. In order to ensure timely tilling, the county government had already instructed each district and village three times, during the New Year and in mid-March, to seize the time after the Qingming Festival to rectify the situation. Each district immediately carried out rectification. As of March 28th, out of 331 villages in the county, 266 villages needed rectification, 86 villages had basically completed rectification, and 94 villages were in the process of rectification. Therefore, the land of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers could be tilled on time.

　　文安县抓住工作主要环节
    春耕河工副业三不误
    关键是组织群众力量实行互助
    【本报讯】河北文安县领导群众春耕、春季河工、副业生产三者紧密结合，作到了副业生产不停工，春耕、春种、春锄不误时，并完成第一段河工。这成绩的获得主要是抓住了组织起来，团结互助，发动妇女参加生产，整顿代耕四个环节，解决矛盾克服困难。
    文安是灾情较重的县份，去年冬季生产，在县区村干部、党员与群众一致的努力下，搞出了成绩，达到了自救。今春发放赈贷粮后，三月份全县参加副业、手工业生产者，已达七万一千五百三十五人，占全县总人数三分之一以上。可是解冻后春耕、春种（早熟作物）、春锄（锄麦）须要动手，庞大的河工任务又急待动工，同时副业生产更不能停止，这个矛盾日益加剧；文安本来就地广人稀，特别去年受灾后人力逃荒，牲口出卖，农具一部出卖或损坏了，更加重了困难。在这个紧急的情况下，开始从县到区的领导还是只重视救灾、忽视春耕春种（详情见三月十八日本报）。县政府与中共文安县县委，检查出这个问题后，就特别注意解决这些矛盾与困难，曾三次研究具体措施指示各区，认真的加强春耕、春工的具体领导。至四月一日统计，六个区二百三十三个村，已耕过春地十三万七千九百九十一亩（其中有一万七千一百六十九亩耕过二遍），占应耕地数百分之六十二。已播种早熟作物（春大麦、蒜、高粱、糜、黍、谷、春菜等）五万六千二百十七亩。已锄过麦地九万四千一百二十四亩，占总数百分之五十。河工从三月二十七日开工，至四月四日已完成第一段，从李家房子至毛耳湾九千九百公尺长（其中并有两道决口），六万二千三百零二公方土的工程。副业生产，除皮硝业因停止收购，已转业外，各种副业都没有停工，席业并有发展。
    文安县怎样抓住四个主要环节的呢？
    组织起来互助生产
    首先领导掌握了组织起来第一的方针，进行了广泛深入的宣传。号召自愿结合劳动互助小组，推动干部、党员、劳模带动群众，县区干部从点滴着手进行帮助，并在旧有的副业生产互助组基础上，领导转向农副业、打堤结合的小组。民工一般的都参加到互助组或自己托好代种人，群众在春耕、春工、副业生产中，组织合伙互助的约占三分之二。其组织形式有以下几种：（一）农、副业、打堤相结合的互助组，是从副业生产基础上建立起来的。四区秦各庄四十八个人打堤都参加了互助组。中共党员武金良领导的互助组，七个人，四个人去打堤，三个人在家一面种地一面熬硝等等。（二）拨工换工人拉耠子。这一般的是没有牲口，或牲口弱或者地太湿进行的组织。二区大董村李亭和十亩应耕地，二个劳动力，但没有牲口，李益和有一个劳动力，一个牲口。他们两家拨工，李益和给李亭和耕地，李亭和给李益和去锄麦。像这种小组该村共有十二组三十九户。五区口头村有一千二百亩地要种早熟作物，但因为地湿，牲口不能进地，必须人拉耧，该村中共支部书记牛宝绅就组织了五户，人拉耧六天工夫种上五十亩豌豆，带动了全村都行动起来。像这种合伙的，据口头、太保庄等三个村就有四十组，一百七十户。（三）临时插犋。因为人畜力农具的缺乏，一户单独能春耕的很少，所以这种形式的互助最多。二区孙氏三月二十七日一天就有一百六十九个牲口临时插成三、五户不等的六十四个小组，共五十张犁六十张耠子下地，一天耕过五百亩地。
    团结友爱互相帮助
    组织合伙互助，有的户，特别是寡、孤、老、残没有劳动力的户和逃荒户，仍不能解决困难。所以必须教育群众，团结友爱互相帮助克服困难。提倡请犋、借牲口。二区王家务有十二户，到水乡村借来十二个牲口耕地，刘文彬在曹庄村亲戚家借来一头牛，不但耕完自己的十六亩地，还给刘培元耕地二十亩。朱家务李广辛有十二亩地应该耕，自己没有牲口，在本村请了两张犁（连牲口代人）只管饭，一天就耕完了头遍。对逃荒户的土地，主要是叫回来种地。不回来的由村干部找人代种，二区孙氏村共一百四十户逃荒的（家中有人的五十五户），通过亲友关系写信叫回种的三十六户，托给当家子或合适人代种的四十六户，齐瑞僧没回来，有四亩半地，托张文志代种，还有三户没人管，就由村干部找人给耕种，回来再商量给代价的办法。对孤寡残老主要是教育自己劳动或托亲友助耕。
    充分发动妇女参加春耕锄麦
    充分发动妇女参加田间生产，是解决人畜力不足办法之一。领导上抓住了这一环，所以在一般的早乡，目前除参加各种副业生产的以外，参加春耕锄麦的约占总妇女劳力百分之三十——四十。二区孙氏村有一百三十六个妇女参加春耕锄麦，占总妇女劳力数百分之四十。李兰荣、张秀花（家中男劳力逃荒）等三人组织起来，在烧皮硝基础上，转入锄麦，共五十亩麦田，四天工夫就锄过了三十六亩。五区口头、太保庄等七村统计，九十一个互助组内，有一百零八个妇女参加拉耧耩地。
    整理烈军工属代耕
    灾后，业耕户逃荒，所以烈军工属的地无人耕种。为能及时耕种，县政府已在旧年节与三月中旬，曾三次指示各区、村抓紧在清明节后整顿好。各区即进行整顿，截止三月二十八日，全县三三一个村中须要整理的二六六个村，已基本整理好的八十六个村，正在进行整理的九十四个村。因之，烈军工属的地是能按时耕种上的。（文安县委会张文祺、邢国俊、高謌、景泽、秉珍、化彬、桂芬）
