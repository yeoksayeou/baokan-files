Xinhua News Agency, April 28th:

　　Workers in Gui Sui, Xinxiang, and Cangxian in North China are striving to produce and save to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day. Since the launch of the "Three Observances" (observe time, observe post, observe responsibilities) movement in 14 state-owned enterprises in Gui Sui city, the phenomenon of indiscipline such as lateness, early departure, and leaving work posts without reason has been greatly eliminated in the past month. Recently, various units have launched a competition to save raw materials and improve work efficiency. The general work efficiency of the telecommunications bureau has increased by 10% to 20%. The efficiency of the wool spinning at the woolen mill has also increased from 70 pounds to 120 pounds per day. The production of Jiji Hydropower Company in Cangxian Town, Hebei Province, and its affiliated production units has also been greatly improved recently. After the technical workers of the Huinong Iron Factory changed the labor organization of casting ten waterwheel frames in three furnaces to casting in two furnaces, they saved three man-hours, 150 catties of coke, and other fuel consumption each time. The steam boiler workers in the power plant improved the method of replacing leaking pipes, which resulted in a savings of more than 23,000 catties of rice in the cost of replacing new pipes. In Xinxiang City, the workers of the railway locomotive depot are actively designing and manufacturing axle scrapers and other parts as a "May Day" gift. Thanks to the efforts of the workers, the production volume of Xuanhua Paper Mill has increased by more than 45% in the past half month; the defect rate has dropped to about 10%.

　　归绥沧县新乡工人
    改进生产作“五一”献礼
    【新华社二十八日讯】华北归绥、新乡、沧县等地工人以努力生产节约来迎接“五一”劳动节。归绥市十四个公营企业自展开三守（守时间、守岗位、守职责）运动后，一个月来已大大消灭了迟到早退，无故离开工作岗位等无纪律现象。最近，各单位又展开了节省原料、提高工作效率的竞赛。电讯局一般工作效率已提高了百分之十至二十。毛织厂纺毛线的效率亦由每日七十磅增至一百二十磅。河北沧县镇既济水电公司及所属的生产单位的生产最近亦有不少改进。惠农铁工厂技术工人把三炉铸十架水车的劳动组织改为两炉铸制后，每次节省三个人工、一百五十斤焦炭及其他燃料的消耗量。发电厂蒸汽锅炉工人改进了换装漏水管的方法，结果使换装新管的费用节省了二万三千多斤米。在新乡市，铁路机务段工人正积极设计与制造刮轴器等机件作为“五一”献礼。由于工人们的努力，宣化造纸厂半个月来的生产量，已提高百分之四十五以上；废品已降到百分之十左右。
