　　On the Jing-Sui Railway Line
    (By our reporter Bai Yuan)
    People sat quietly on a train heading from Beijing to Suiyuan. The carriage was filled with murmuring voices, rippling in the rhythm of the rumbling train. Various staff members traveling from Beijing to different locations on official duties were discussing their work plans after arriving at their destinations. Passengers traveling with their families were planning future household matters with their wives. A porter who used to make a living by selling his labor in Beijing, now changing jobs to return home to engage in agricultural production, sat in a seat by the window, looking at the fields outside and pointing out to his companion the plots of land that had already been plowed. The early spring sun shone on the vast fields outside the train window, and many plowed fields were orderly piled with fertilizer for sowing. Along every village road, carts loaded with manure stirred up dust, carrying loads of manure to the fields against the wind and sand of the northern spring. Inside and outside the train, everything was filled with the joy of spring, yet appeared so calm and orderly.
    At some point, a farmer from Sihaixian got on the train with his wife and two children. He had moved from Sihaixian to Xuanhua last year when the People's Government called for immigration. In a village in Xuanhua, he was allocated land and settled down. Now, he was taking his wife and children from Sihaixian to Xuanhua, preparing to rush to the village at the start of the spring plowing and immediately begin production. On the train, he often switched seats with his two children, sitting next to his wife and calculating new household affairs with her. Clearly, they had infinite hopes for the future.
    When the train arrived in Huailai, among the passengers who boarded in Huailai were several farmer representatives returning from the Huailai County People's Congress. They had just finished their meeting and excitedly boarded the train to return to their villages. One of them was the deputy village chairman of Jingtangfang Village in Xinbao’an District, named Fan Wenming. He used to run a small business in Zhangjiakou; when Zhangjiakou was evacuated, he retreated with the People's Liberation Army, returned home to produce; during the land reform, he was allocated more than ten mu of land. He said he was forty-seven years old this year, but due to the suffering of past hard years, he looked like someone over fifty. Speaking of his experience attending the Huailai County People's Representative Conference, he spoke eloquently. His loud voice seemed to want everyone in the carriage to hear him. His first sentence was: "The people have land, have power, and can speak their minds. What else is there to do besides production!" The originally calm air in the carriage was broken by his voice, and the eyes of all the people were attracted to him. Some even left their seats and stood next to him to listen to his eloquent narration.
    From Fan Wenming's earnest words and his serious expression, it seemed as if he was still sitting in the meeting place of the People's Representative Conference expressing his opinions. He said that he disagreed with the speech of the district chief of Wangjialou District at the representative meeting, because the district chief of Wangjialou District mentioned in his speech that the harvest in Wangjialou District was poor last year due to the famine, and some people were not getting enough to eat and had no cotton clothes to wear. Fan Wenming said: "Why don't you talk about how your district is leading production? Why didn't you lead the sideline production well? The relief grain distributed by the government was not distributed to Wangjialou!" He introduced a female representative from Wangjialou, Wang Guilan, to the passengers in the car, saying that she worked hard in production and helped her family survive the famine last year, and was rewarded at this People's Representative Conference. Finally, he took out the production plans for each village this year, which they had made at this People's Representative Conference, for everyone to see. In their production plan, this year they want to achieve an increase of one and a half dou of grain per mu compared to last year. I asked him: "What method will you use to increase one and a half dou of grain?" He said: "We will take the plan back, and it will have to be discussed by the masses in the village. If everyone agrees and everyone guarantees it, then how can we not succeed?"
    The train passed Xinbao'an City, and there was one more stop before Fan Wenming got off. He pointed out to me the fields he was familiar with from the train window. To the south of the railway, there was a good piece of irrigated land, and to the north, there was less irrigated land, mostly dry land. Fan Wenming said: There are many alkaline lands to the north of the railway. Because of the high alkalinity, the crops were burned to death by the alkali last year due to the drought and water shortage, and many lands were barren. On a piece of alkaline land he pointed out to me, there were still many dead grasses left over from last year. He said that they were planning to turn over all these barren lands this year, and then divert water to wash away the alkali in the land, so that not a single mu of land would be barren.
    At a small station, Fan Wenming got off the train. The rumbling train continued to gallop across the vast plains. At each station, batches of passengers got on and off, alternating. They were walking the paths of life they had arranged for themselves with a shared sense of urgency. Just as Fan Wenming thought, now that the people have land and power, let us begin to build our own happy lives step by step.

　　京绥路上
    （本报记者白原）
    人们安静地坐在一列从北京开往绥远去的火车上。车厢里一片絮絮的语声，在隆隆的火车的节拍里荡漾着。带着职务从北京到各地去的各种工作人员，互相在研究着抵达目的地后的工作计划。携带家属的旅客们，在和他的妻子筹划着未来的家务。一位从前在北京靠出卖苦力为生，现在转业回家准备从事农业生产的脚行工人，坐在一个靠车窗的座位上，望着窗外的田野，向他旁边的同伴指点着那一块块已经翻犁过的土地。初春的太阳，照耀车窗外面的广大的田野，许多已经翻过的田地里，有次序的堆着播种用的肥料。沿着每一条乡村的道路，一辆一辆的送粪的大车轧着尘土，迎着北方春天的风沙，把一车车粪送到地里去。车里车外，一切都充满着春天的喜悦，而又显得那样娴静和有秩序。
    不知什么时候，在一个站上上来了一位四海县的农民，带着他的妻子和两个孩子。他是去年人民政府号召移民的时候，由四海迁移到宣化去的。在宣化的一个村子里，分到了土地，安了家。现在，他从四海把他的妻子和儿女带到宣化去，准备在开始春耕的时候赶到村里，立即开始动手生产。在火车上，他常常和他的两个孩子调换着座位，坐到他妻子的旁边去，和她盘算着新的家务。显然，他们对未来的日子寄托着无限的希望。
    火车到达怀来的时候，在怀来上车的乘客中，有几位参加怀来县人民代表大会回来的农民代表。他们刚开完了会，兴致勃勃地坐上火车回村里去。其中有一位新保安区经堂房村的村副主席，名字叫范文明，原先是在张家口做小买卖；张家口撤退时，随解放军撤退下来，回家生产；土地改革时，分到了十几亩土地。他说他今年四十七岁，但是，由于过去艰苦岁月的折磨，看起来像是五十岁以外的人了。谈起他这次参加怀来县各界人民代表会议的情形，滔滔不绝。他那高朗的嗓子，好像要叫全车箱的人都听得见一样，第一句话就说：“老百姓有了地、有了权、有话能说，除了生产，还干什么！”车箱里原来的一片平静的空气，被他的声音所打破了，所有的人的目光都吸引到他的身上，甚至有的人离开了座位，站到他的旁边来听他的滔滔不绝的叙述。
    从范文明的认真的说话和他的严肃的表情里，好像他仍然是坐在人民代表会议的会场里发表意见一样。他说他不同意王家楼区区长在代表会议上的发言，因为王家楼区区长在发言时，提出王家楼区去年因为灾荒收成不好，有些人吃不饱，没有棉衣穿的事情。范文明说：“你为什么不好好说说你们区里怎样领导生产？为什么没把副业生产领导好？政府发下的救济粮，又不是没有分给王家楼！”他向同车的客人介绍了一位王家楼的妇女代表王贵兰，说她一个人努力生产，使全家在去年渡过了灾荒，在这次人民代表会议上受到了大会的奖励。最后，他把他们在这次人民代表会议上所订的各村今年生产计划拿出来给大家看。在他们的生产计划上，今年要达到每亩地比去年增产一斗五升粮食。我就问他：“用什么办法增加一斗五升粮食？”他说：“我们把计划带回去，还要经过村里群众的讨论，如果大家都同意，大家都来保证，那还能不成？”
    火车过了新保安城，离范文明下车的地方还有一站的路程。他在车窗里指点着他所熟悉的那些田地给我看。在铁路的南边，是一片良好的水地，北边水地较少，大部是旱地。范文明说：在铁路北边有许多碱地，因为碱多，去年天旱缺水，庄稼被碱烧死，许多地都荒了。在他指给我看的一块碱地上，还留着去年所留下的许多枯草。他说他们今年准备把这些荒地通通翻过来，然后引水将地里的碱冲去，不叫荒了一亩地。
    在一个小车站上，范文明下了车。隆隆的火车继续在广阔的原野上奔驰着。在每一个车站上，上下的旅客一批一批的交替着。他们带着一种共同的迫切的心情，走着他们自己所安排的生活的道路。正如范文明所想的一样，老百姓有了地，有了权，那么就让我们开始来一步一步的建立自己的幸福的生活。
