Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. The Teacher's Newspaper here recently published a special article discussing the achievements of the Hungarian People's Republic in education, culture, and science. It stated that before the war, the number of students in Hungarian secondary schools was 54,000, while in the last academic year, it had increased to 87,000. Last year, more than one-third of all students in higher education institutions were workers who came directly from their jobs. To enable the working people to receive secondary education without affecting their work, 169 night schools have been established this year, with a total of more than 10,000 students. In addition, more than 22,000 working people are studying in adult secondary schools.

The broad masses of working people are eagerly studying the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. When the first volume of Stalin's Collected Works was published in Hungarian for the first time, 75,000 copies were printed and sold out in a few days. Now, 100,000 copies of each volume of Stalin's Collected Works are printed. Russian books are becoming increasingly popular. From 1945 to 1948, many representative works of famous Soviet writers have been translated into Hungarian. In the third quarter of last year alone, Hungary published 56 works by Soviet and Old Russian literary masters.

    斯大林文集在匈销售最多
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：此间教师报顷发表专文，论述匈牙利人民共和国在教育、文化和科学方面所获的成就称：战前匈牙利中等学校就学人数是五万四千人，而在上一学年已增至八万七千人。去年，高等教育机关全部学生的三分之一以上，都是直接从工作岗位上来的工人。为使劳动人民能够接受中等教育而不影响工作，今年，已经成立了一百六十九个夜校，学生总人数已超过一万人。另有二万二千余名劳动人民则在成人中学就学。
    广大的劳动群众热切地钻研马、恩、列、斯的著作。斯大林文集第一卷第一次用匈牙利文出版时，印行了七万五千册，几天便卖光了，现在，斯大林文集每卷都印了十万册。俄文书越来越畅销。自一九四五年至一九四八年期间，许多苏联著名作家的代表作，已经译成匈牙利文。仅在去年第三季中，匈牙利就出版了五十六种苏联和旧俄文学大师的作品。
