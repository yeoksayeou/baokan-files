　　Farm Labor Notes of Personnel from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau

　　Two hundred and twenty personnel from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau went to the Bureau's farm outside Chaoyangmen on April 2nd to work.

　　The farm has thirty to forty mu of land, with five high ridges, about six or seven feet tall, stretching across the middle from south to north, like rows of small city walls. The plan is to level these five ridges, which would allow the farm to increase its cultivated land by fifty mu.

　　The comrades quickly spread out onto one of the ridges. The two hundred-plus people formed a line that was half a li long. At the sound of the command, the comrades started working together. The female comrades were not to be outdone, using all their energy to diligently chop the earth. Near noon, the comrades, baked by the sun, could no longer stand wearing their cotton-padded jackets, and one by one they tossed them onto the furrows and the cultivated land. Some comrades from the Propaganda Section even took off their shoes and worked barefoot, which was even more convenient. The comrades competed to be labor heroes and to be the first to complete their tasks, vigorously swinging their picks.

　　From the south end of the ridge came the sound of singing: "The workers have strength, hey! The workers have strength!" That was the section of the Fifth Division, where the picks were working even harder to the rhythm of the song. The singing cut through the sky, adding even more strength to the comrades of other teams.

　　When the two-hour major rest period arrived, the sound of gongs and drums became even more energetic. Comrade Shen Tao from the Third Division put down his pick, walked near the gongs and drums, and started to dance the yangko. Looking at the blisters that had already formed on his hands, he said, "It's really useless, getting blisters from digging so little!" With that, he nonchalantly went to drink water while still dancing. During this labor session, many comrades developed blisters on their hands, but everyone was confident that through frequent labor in the future, they would turn their scholar's hands into working hands.

　　During the break, many comrades sat scattered on the ground, chatting casually. One comrade said, "Comrade Nie Xu from the Security Section is really great! He worked continuously for more than an hour without rest! He's the labor hero of this group!"

　　After lunch, the majority of the work was quickly completed. The Fifth Division was the first to complete its task, and they actively helped the lagging Third Division. Originally, the Third Division's division of labor was unscientific; it was fast at first, but later it didn't work. The entire section of the office was divided into six groups, and each group was further divided into three shifts, with one shift resting in rotation. Each group was responsible for a section, so detailed division of labor allowed for faster task completion.

　　The farm's manager, Comrade Shi, and Section Chief Qu, watching the ridge being leveled, happily calculated that in a few more Sundays, these ridges would be transformed into arable land. If these lands were all turned into vegetable gardens, production could be increased by 250,000 jin of vegetables this year.

　　Section Chief Qu said with both emotion and excitement, "This farm was originally seized by British and American imperialists to be used as a shooting range. During the corrupt and wasteful management under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was mostly in a semi-abandoned state. Today, in the hands of our people, even the ridges can be cultivated and produce!"

　　At a little after three o'clock, the labor came to an end. In five hours, half a li of ridges had been turned into 3.6 mu of arable land. The comrades were all pleased with their labor and recognized the greatness of labor.

　　The western ridges still stood tall. The willows on the ridges silently stretched out their leafless branches under the setting sun. Soon, all of this would be turned into fertile land under our picks. Looking at this prospect, we left the farm with joy.

　　京市公安总局人员
    农场劳动散记
    嘉
    京市公安总局二百二十人于四月二日到朝阳门外该局的农场去劳动。
    农场有地三四顷，中间绵亘着五条高阔约六、七尺的土岗，从南到北像一道道的小城墙。在计划中，铲平了这五条土岗，农场就可增加五十亩耕地。
    全体同志很快地就散布在一条土岗上了，二百多人排成了一列半里长的队伍，号令一响，同志们一齐动手；女同志不甘落后，拿出全付精力，努力砍土。将近中午，同志们受了阳光的蒸晒，棉袄穿不住了，一件件地抛在田垅上、耕地上。宣传科有的同志甚至连鞋子都脱了，赤着脚，工作更方便些。同志们争做劳动英雄争先完成任务，奋力的挥动着镐头。
    土岗的南头传来了歌声：“咱们工人有力量，嘿！咱们工人有力量！”那是五处的分地，镐头随着歌声，更有力地工作着。歌声划过了长空，给别队的同志们添助了更大的力量。
    到了两个钟头一次大休息的时候，锣鼓声响得更起劲了。三处沈涛同志，放下了镐头，走到锣鼓的近旁，扭起秧歌来。看看手上已起了水泡，说：“真是没用，挖这样一点就打了泡！”说着又满不在乎的扭着去喝水了。在这次劳动中，许多同志手上都打了泡，但是大家都有信心在以后经常劳动中，把书生的手变成劳动的手。
    休息时，许多同志散坐在地上轻松地闲谈着，一个同志说：“治安科聂旭同志真棒！连续劳动一个多钟头没有休息！是这一组的劳动英雄喽！”
    午饭过后，很快就大部分完工了；五处是最先完成任务的，他们并积极帮助落后了的三处。原来三处的分工法不科学，最初很快，后来就不行了。办公室的全段分为六组，每小组内又分三班，轮流有一班休息，每组责成一段，所以细致的分工是能更快的完成任务的。
    农场的经理史同志同曲处长，看着土岗被铲平了，愉快地计算着再有几个星期日，这些道岗就会变成了耕地。这些地如果都开成菜园，今年可以增产二十五万斤蔬菜。
    曲处长又感慨又兴奋地说：“这片农场原来是英、美帝国主义霸占来作打靶场用的，在国民党反动统治时代腐化贪污的管理中也只是在半荒废状态，今天在我们人民的手里，连土岗都可以耕种生产了！”
    三点多钟，劳动告一段落。五个钟头把半里长的土岗变成了三亩六分可耕的田地，同志们都为自己的劳作感到欣慰，认识到了劳动的伟大。
    西边的土岗，仍矗立着，岗上的柳树在夕阳下，静静地伸着无叶的枝条，不久这一切都要在我们的镐头下变成良田了，我们望着这远景，欣慰地离开了农场。
