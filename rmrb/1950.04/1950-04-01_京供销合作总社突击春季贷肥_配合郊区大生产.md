[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To support the large-scale production movement in the suburbs of Beijing and to ensure that farmers do not miss the farming season, the Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has begun a crash program of spring fertilizer loans. This spring's fertilizer loan program is expected to total two million catties of millet, to be loaned to farmers in the eight suburban districts. The loan program is being carried out through an agreement signed between the Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Municipal People's Bank, stipulating the amount of fertilizer to be loaned and the allocation ratio. After the Municipal People's Bank signs contracts with the cooperative societies in each suburban district, the cooperative societies are responsible for distribution. There are two loan methods: in the four districts of the West Suburbs, North Suburbs, Fengtai, and Nanyuan, the Municipal General Cooperative, in coordination with the Municipal People's Bank, purchases dried manure and bean cake fertilizer, which the farmers transport themselves; in the four districts of Shijingshan, Mentougou, East Suburbs, and Changxindian, the farmers purchase the fertilizer themselves. Apart from the fertilizer purchased by the farmers themselves, the Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the People's Bank have already purchased 3.08 million catties of dried manure and 1.94 million catties of bean cake. As of the 30th of last month, all the bean cake had been loaned out, and over 1.71 million catties of dried manure had been loaned out. It is estimated that all of it will be loaned out by the beginning of this month.
