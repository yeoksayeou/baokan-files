　　Private Industry in Beijing Develops
    New Small Factories Open
    [Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: In January and February of this year, 477 new private factories were approved to open by the Industry Bureau, adding 1,768 employees (including 203 households that had opened before December 1949 but had not registered). A total of 153 factories closed down. The new factories are all small in scale and need to absorb more capital to gradually expand. Among them, factories with fewer than 10 people account for 96.23%, and only two factories have more than 20 people. By industry category, the weaving and dyeing industry increased the most, with a total of 109 households, followed by the machinery and iron industry with 62 households, and the chemical industry with 14 households. As for the factories that closed down, the main reasons were high production costs, low quality, and poor sales. For example, 30 soap-making factories closed down in January and February this year, but at the same time, factories in this industry with better product quality and larger scale increased their output.

　　京市私营工业有发展
    新开小型工厂四百家
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市私营工业今年一、二月份经工业局批准新开业工厂共四百七十七户，增加职工一千七百六十八人（内有四九年十二月前已开设而未登记的二百零三户）、歇业共一百五十三户。在新开业的工厂中，生产规模都很小，需要再吸收资金，逐渐扩大。其中十人以内的工厂占百分之九十六点二三，二十个人以上的工厂只有两家。按行业类别分，织染业增加最多，共一百零九户，机器铁工业六十二户，化学工业十四户。至于歇业的工厂，主要原因都是由于生产成本高，品质低，销路不好。如造胰业今年一、二月份歇业有三十户，但同时这一业中产品质量较好、规模较大的工厂却增加产量。
