Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th: As a result of the efforts of nearly ten million disaster victims in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in the Central and Southern region to engage in production for self-salvation under the leadership of the people's governments of each province, more than five million disaster victims have now obtained two months' worth of living supplies, and the remaining disaster victims have also mostly found ways to make a living. The aforementioned four provinces suffered severe disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and hail last year, and the disaster-stricken areas accounted for one-sixth of the total cultivated land area of the four provinces. After the disasters occurred, the people's governments of each province attached great importance to disaster relief work. First, a large number of grain loans were allocated to help disaster victims carry out production for disaster relief in a focused manner, enabling millions of disaster victims to find ways to produce. At the same time, the people's governments of each province also sent many inspection teams or慰问 (wèiwèn:consulation or comfort) teams to the disaster areas to understand the disaster situation,慰问 (wèiwèn:consulation or comfort) the disaster victims, and help the disaster victims study ways to survive the famine through production. For example, Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, personally went to disaster-stricken villages in Lanfeng in March to understand the grain storage situation of disaster victims户 (hù:household) by户 (hù:household) and offer慰问 (wèiwèn:consulation or comfort). In order to fully lead the disaster relief work, the provinces and special districts have successively organized production and disaster relief committees. In places where the work is relatively深入 (shēn rù: thorough), such as Shangcai County in Henan and Mianyang County in Hubei, organizations leading production and disaster relief have also been established in various districts and villages.
　　In the disaster relief process, various localities have adopted methods such as convening people's representative conferences or disaster victim representative conferences at all levels to mobilize and organize disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation. For example, production for disaster relief was discussed as the main topic at the people's representative conferences at all levels in sixty counties in Henan Province. After education, the enthusiasm for production of disaster victims in many areas has been greatly improved. After production for self-salvation, the lives of the province's four million disaster victims have been resolved. The People's Governments of the eleven counties along洞庭湖 (Dòngtíng Hú: Lake Dongting) Lake in Hunan Province, which was severely affected by floods, and the Mianyang Special District in Hubei Province, used the method of work-for-relief to organize disaster victims to repair堤 (dī: embankment), which also solved the livelihood difficulties of nearly one million disaster victims. In order to shorten the spring famine, the provinces issued a large number of agricultural loans last winter to mobilize disaster victims to carry out winter耕 (gēng: cultivate) and播种 (bōzhòng: sow seeds). According to statistics from Hunan Province, the winter耕 (gēng: cultivate) area last year reached 7.57 million亩 (mǔ: unit of area), exceeding the winter耕 (gēng: cultivate) area in 1948. In order to solve the problem of raw material supply and sales of sideline products for disaster victims, supply and marketing cooperatives have been重点 (zhòngdiǎn: key) established in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics from Wuyang, Luohe, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Baofeng, and Linru counties in Henan Province, there are already 48 various cooperatives with more than 10,000 members. The supply and marketing cooperative in Zhuhe Town, Jianli County, Hubei Province, organized disaster victims to engage in textile production, developing from three weaving machines and a small number of spinning wheels to 200 looms and more than 1,900 spinning wheels. The cooperative also flexibly changed its business policy according to the needs of disaster victims. During the agricultural off-season, it used its main strength to organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production and transportation; when the spring耕 (gēng: cultivate) season arrived, it used most of its funds to purchase agricultural tools,耕 (gēng: cultivate) cattle, seeds, and other interest-free loans to disaster victims, mobilizing disaster victims to carry out spring耕 (gēng: cultivate) production.

　　中南区灾情日益减轻
    五百万灾民获两月生活资料
    【新华社汉口七日电】中南区河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省近千万的灾民，在各省人民政府领导下努力生产自救的结果，现已有五百余万灾民获得两个月的生活资料，其余灾民也大都找到了生活门径。上述四省去年曾遭受严重的水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，被灾区占四省总耕地面积六分之一。灾荒发生后，各省人民政府对救灾工作十分重视。首先拨发大批贷粮，有重点地扶助灾民进行生产救灾，使百万灾民找到生产门路。同时，各省人民政府又派遣许多视察小组或慰问小组至灾区了解灾情，慰问灾民，并帮助灾民研究生产渡荒的办法。如河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃于三月亲至兰封受灾村庄，逐户了解灾民存粮情况和进行慰问。各省、专区为全力领导救灾工作，均先后组织了生产救灾委员会。在工作比较深入的地方，如河南的上蔡县、湖北的沔阳县亦均建立了各区、村领导生产救灾的组织。
    在救灾中，各地均通过召开各界人民代表会或灾民代表会的方法，发动和组织灾民进行生产自救。如河南省六十个县的各界代表会上都以生产渡荒作为主要议题来讨论。不少地区的灾民经过教育后，生产积极性大为提高。该省四百万灾民经过生产自救，生活困难已获得解决。水灾严重的湖南省洞庭湖滨湖十一县及湖北省的沔阳专区人民政府用以工代赈的办法，组织灾民修堤，亦解决了近百万灾民的生活困难。为缩短春荒，去冬各省曾发放大批农贷发动灾民进行冬耕播种，据湖南省统计，去年冬耕面积达七百五十七万亩，超过一九四八年的冬耕面积。为解决灾民副业产品的原料供应和销路问题，各地农村均有重点地试办供销合作社。据河南省舞阳、漯河、襄城、鲁山、宝丰、临汝六个县不完全统计，已有各种合作社四十八个，社员万余人。湖北省监利县朱河镇的供销合作社组织灾民进行纺织生产，由三架织布机和少数纺车发展到二百架织机和一千九百多纺车。该社并根据灾民需要，灵活改变营业方针，在农闲时以主要力量组织灾民进行副业生产和运输；春耕季节到来时即以大部资金购买农具、耕牛、种子等无利贷给灾民，发动灾民进行春耕生产。
