Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: Trade treasuries are being gradually established in major cities in the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South regions. The Xi'an Trade Treasury in the Northwest region was established on March 20th, and trade treasuries are being established in other areas. The Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China in the Southwest region also began handling trade treasury work on the same day, and state-owned trade corporations in Chongqing have implemented a cash deposit system. In the Central South region, as of the 22nd of this month, branch treasuries have been established in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Guilin, and in Hubei and Guangdong provinces. Preparations for establishing county and city sub-treasuries are actively underway. State-owned trade companies in various locations, from the date of establishment of the branch treasuries, have deposited all existing funds into the treasury, and all daily cash revenues have been deposited in accordance with regulations. Daily and report systems have been strictly implemented.

This Newspaper reports: The Xingtai Office of the People's Bank of China in Hebei Province also officially established the Xingtai Special District Trade Treasury on March 25th. On March 20th, the office convened a meeting of the main responsible persons of various specialized state-owned trade departments in the Xingtai urban area to discuss in detail the important significance of establishing a trade treasury and how to execute trade contracts. After research by the meeting, everyone unanimously clarified that after the establishment of the treasury, all funds that should be deposited must be deposited in full. However, in order not to affect the overall work, the necessary expenses before the establishment of the treasury could be overdrawn from the bank for an appropriate amount, and submitted to the Central Trade Department for approval. Because the Salt Branch and other groups were transferred from Shijiazhuang to Xingtai, it was stipulated that all daily sales proceeds should be remitted from the Xingtai Bank Office to Shijiazhuang for deposit. It was also strictly stipulated that the cash deposit time for each trade department should be 10:00 am the next day. Agency stores in various outposts may postpone depending on the distance, but must remit the sales proceeds to Xingtai daily through the local bank. In order to complete the treasury establishment task ahead of schedule, the bank office convened a meeting of various department store branches and bank accountants on March 21st to study the drafting of contracts and accounting procedures, and decided to clear all deposits and overdrafts within a few days. The official office deposit began on the 25th.
