　　Live Within Our Means and Correctly Handle Village Finances
    Jinan North Reduces Expenditures by 30 Percent
    Surplus After Balancing Revenue and Expenditure Can Reach 12 Percent of Total Revenue
    [Report from this newspaper] In line with the principle of living within its means in local finances, Jinan North County, Shandong Province, meticulously reviewed revenue and expenditure estimates, appropriately reducing county and village financial expenditures by 30 percent, achieving a balanced budget, and saving 12 percent of total village revenue.
    After reading the *People's Daily* editorial "Full of Hope" and related news reprinted in the *Dazhong Daily* on March 10, the county leadership convened a county finance committee and village economic management committee on March 13 to discuss in detail the revenue and expenditure estimates for the year from July 1949 to June 1950. On the revenue side, the original budget was far from sufficient to cover the administrative expenses of the government system itself. After repeated study, it was unanimously agreed that the principle of living within our means should be followed as much as possible to achieve a balanced budget. In the future, in addition to ensuring revenue, expenditures should be reduced where possible, and those that can be postponed should be postponed. Taking the village expenditure item alone, the original budget required a total expenditure of 866,065.98 *jin* of financial grain. Among the expenditure items, village office expenses were estimated at 84,549 *jin*; village cadres' meeting meals, tea, and other expenses totaled 61,762 *jin*; in addition, there were village cadre subsidies, village newspaper fees, social health expenses, and education funds. Among these, the education funds were stipulated by the commissioner's office to account for 35 percent of revenue, requiring an expenditure of 239,757.35 *jin*. The total of the above expenditures exceeded the total revenue by 181,044.98 *jin*. After the meeting reviewed each item, except for social health expenses, because the county's diseases and disasters were still serious, the original budget was still followed, and when necessary, a request could be submitted to the higher authorities for approval to increase it appropriately. The rest were appropriately reduced. For example, the standard budget for village cadre subsidies was originally 452,052 *jin*. 194,903 *jin* had already been spent in the first half of the year, and there were still 257,149 *jin* for this year. In the next three months, only 96,075 *jin* would need to be spent, so this item alone could save 161,074 *jin*. Another major expenditure was education funds. At present, the county has 32 public primary schools with 69 teachers and staff. The actual expenditure is 147,000 *jin*, which is 92,757.35 *jin* less than the original budget of 239,757.35 *jin*. Therefore, the meeting decided to change the budget to an annual expenditure of 147,000 *jin*; in addition to the 98,000 *jin* already spent in the first eight months, 49,000 *jin* should be spent from March to June, further reducing expenditures by 9,000 *jin*. This reduced the original budget from 866,065.98 *jin* to 603,234.63 *jin*. Compared with the annual revenue of 685,021 *jin*, there would be a surplus of 81,786.37 *jin* after balancing revenue and expenditure. In this way, the total estimated village expenditure was reduced by 30 percent compared to the original budget, and the surplus accounted for 12 percent of the total revenue.

　　量入为出正确处理村财政
    济北支出核减三成
    收支相抵节余尚可达总收入百分之十二
    【本报讯】山东济北县为本地方财政量入为出的原则，缜密审核收支概算，使县财政和村经费支出适当地缩减了百分之三十，做到收支平衡，并节余全部村经费收入的百分之十二。
    该县领导上于三月十日读大众日报转载人民日报社论“大有希望”及有关消息后，于十三日即召开县财委会，村经管委会详细研讨该县一九四九年七月至一九五○年六月一年的收支概算。在收入方面，照原来预算仅用以应付政府本系统行政支出尚相差很多。后经反复研究，一致认为应本量入为出原则，尽量做到收支平衡，今后除应保证收入外，支出方面则可省者省，可以缓办者缓办。仅就村经费收支一项，原来预算共需支出财粮八六六、○六五·九八斤；其支出项目中，村办公费计八四、五四九斤；村干部开会吃饭、茶水等开支六一、七六二斤，另有村干部补助粮、村报费、社会卫生费、教育经费等。其中教育经费专署规定占收入的百分之三十五，计需开支二三九、七五七·三五斤。以上各项支出合计超过全部收入一八一、○四四·九八斤。经会议逐项审查后，除社会卫生费，因该县病灾尚严重，故仍按原预算开支，必要时并可呈上级批准，酌予增加一部外，余均加以适当缩减。如村干部补助粮，按标准预算原为四五二、○五二斤。前半年已开支了一九四、九○三斤，今年尚有二五七、一四九斤，今后三月再需开支九六、○七五斤即可，故仅此项支出即可省一六一、○七四斤。再一项较大开支是教育经费，现该县共有公费初级小学三十二所，教职员六十九人，照现在开支实际为一四七、○○○斤，较原预算二三九、七五七·三五斤少九二、七五七·三五斤。因此会议决定将预算改为全年开支一四七、○○○斤；除前八个月已开支九八、○○○斤外，三到六月份应开支四九、○○○斤，又减少开支九、○○○斤。这一来，使原预算从八六六、○六五·九八斤，减为六○三、二三四·六三斤，若与全年收入六八五、○二一斤相较，除收支相抵外，尚可节余八一、七八六·三七斤。这样村经费支出总概算即较原预算减低了百分之三十，其节余数占全部收入的百分之十二。
