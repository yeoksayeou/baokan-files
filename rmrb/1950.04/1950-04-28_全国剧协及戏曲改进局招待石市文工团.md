　　National Drama Association and Opera Improvement Bureau
    Host Shijiazhuang City Art Troupe
    [Our Newspaper] The National Drama Association and the Ministry of Culture's Opera Improvement Bureau held a tea party on the 24th to host the Shijiazhuang City Art Troupe, which came to Beijing to perform "Not a Cicada." At the meeting, figures from the film and drama circles, including Tian Han, Hong Shen, Yang Shaoxuan, Ma Shaobo, Wu Xue, and Jin Shan, offered valuable opinions on the playwriting, directing, and performance aspects of "Not a Cicada," expressing hope that the play could be performed publicly in the capital. Everyone believed that the future drama movement should be expanded more widely, requiring more young playwrights, especially paying attention to young worker-writers. It was also hoped that "Not a Cicada" could be adapted into an opera. Famous film and drama figure Hong Shen is willing to personally help with the rehearsal. The Shijiazhuang City Art Troupe plans to have the play revised with the help of literary and art circles and film circles in the capital, and then hold a public performance in Beijing.

　　全国剧协及戏曲改进局
    招待石市文工团
    【本报讯】全国剧协与文化部戏曲改进局于二十四日举行茶会，招待此次来京演出《不是蝉》的石家庄市文艺工作团。会上，影剧界田汉、洪深、杨绍萱、马少波、吴雪、金山等对《不是蝉》的剧作、导演、演出工作等，都提出了宝贵的意见，希望这个剧能在首都公演。大家认为今后的戏剧运动要更广泛展开，需要更多的青年剧作家，尤其应注意青年工人作家。并希望把《不是蝉》改成歌剧。影剧界名家洪深并愿亲自帮助排演。石市文工团拟将此剧由首都文艺界与影剧界帮助进行修改后，在京举行公演。
