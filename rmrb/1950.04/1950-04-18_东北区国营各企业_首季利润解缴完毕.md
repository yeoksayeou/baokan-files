Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. State-owned enterprises in Northeast China have now completed the remittance of enterprise profits for the first quarter of this year. In view of the failure of a small number of units to remit profits on time, the Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government has recently formulated "Provisional Measures for State-owned Industrial Enterprises to Remit Profits and Depreciation." The measures stipulate that each unit's monthly remittance task should be completed before the 10th of the following month. If the payment is overdue, the Finance Department will transfer the amount from the industrial independent accounting unit's deposit in the Northeast Bank. If there are no deposits, the payment unit will borrow from the bank in the form of credit, or deduct it from the long-term investment that should be given.

　　东北区国营各企业
    首季利润解缴完毕
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北国营各企业今年首季企业利润，业已解缴完毕。鉴于少数单位未能做到按时缴纳利润，东北人民政府财政部近特制订“国营工业解缴利润，折旧暂行办法”，规定各单位每月上缴任务应在下月十日前结转完毕，如逾期不缴，即由各工业独立会计单位在东北银行存款项内拨转财政部；如无存款，即由缴款单位向银行举债，以信贷方式借款上解，或在应给的长期投资内扣除。
