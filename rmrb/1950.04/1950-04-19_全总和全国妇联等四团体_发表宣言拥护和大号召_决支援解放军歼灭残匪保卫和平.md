Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation , the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation, today issued a joint declaration, enthusiastically supporting the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

We enthusiastically support the call issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to defend peace: demanding an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, requiring regulation of the implementation of this ban, condemning the government that first dares to use this weapon, and clearly declaring it a war criminal.

Now, the peace-loving and democratic people of the world, united around the powerful peace fortress of the Soviet people, are engaged in a staunch struggle against war provocateurs and to defend world peace, and their strength is growing day by day.

The people of the whole world are increasingly realizing that: to ensure peaceful labor, social prosperity and human progress, the only way is to resolutely fight for defending world peace and striving for national independence and people's democracy. We resolutely oppose the imperialists' attempt to rule and enslave the whole world by using atomic weapons to massacre millions of innocent people. We resolutely oppose the war profiteers suppressing the people in colonies and dependent countries who demand national independence, and provoking wars of aggression for their own profits. We enthusiastically support and participate in just wars to resist aggression and strive for national independence, peace and democracy.

In the past, in order to defeat Japanese imperialism, defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, and expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism from Chinese territory, our Chinese people waged a great War of Resistance Against Japan and a People's Liberation War, paying a high price and finally winning a glorious victory. Today, we are intensifying our efforts to support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and complete the great task of national liberation. We are also doing everything in our power to participate in the construction of a new democratic New China, because this is currently the most effective action for the Chinese people to defend world peace. We call on all the people of China to work harder, use all practical and effective actions, and unite more closely with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world to make the greatest efforts to defend world peace and strive for national independence and people's democracy.

　　全总和全国妇联等四团体
    发表宣言拥护和大号召
    决支援解放军歼灭残匪保卫和平
    【新华社十八日讯】全国总工会、全国民主妇联、全国民主青联及全国学联四团体，本日发表联合宣言，热烈拥护世界拥护和平大会常委会的号召。宣言全文如下：
    我们热烈拥护世界保卫和平大会常设委员会发出的保卫和平的号召：要求无条件地禁止原子武器、要求管制这个禁令的执行、谴责首先胆敢使用这个武器的政府、明确地宣布它为战争罪犯。
    现在全世界爱好和平民主的人民，团结在强大的和平堡垒苏联人民的周围，为反对战争挑拨者、保卫世界和平作着坚强的斗争，其力量正日益壮大。
    全世界的人民都越来越理解到：要保证和平的劳动，社会的繁荣和人类的进步，只有坚决地为保卫世界和平争取民族独立与人民民主而斗争，我们坚决反对帝国主义者为了企图统治和奴役全世界而用原子武器去屠杀千百万无辜人民的行为，我们坚决反对战争贩子为着自己的利润去镇压殖民地与附属国要求民族独立的人民，并挑起侵略战争，我们热烈拥护并参加为着抵抗侵略和争取民族独立与和平民主的正义战争。
    我们中国人民过去为了战胜日本帝国主义，战胜国民党反动派驱逐美国帝国主义侵略势力出中国国土，曾经进行了伟大的抗日战争和人民解放战争，付出了很高的代价，终于赢得了辉煌的胜利。我们今天正在加紧努力支援人民解放军，解放台湾、海南岛和西藏，彻底肃清国民党匪帮的残余势力，完成全国解放的伟大任务，我们也在尽一切力量参加新民主主义的新中国的建设，因为这是目前中国人民保卫世界和平的有效行动。我们号召全中国的人民，更加努力用一切实际的有效的行动，和全世界爱好和平民主的人民更紧密的团结起来，为保卫世界和平，争取民族独立与人民民主而尽最大的努力。
