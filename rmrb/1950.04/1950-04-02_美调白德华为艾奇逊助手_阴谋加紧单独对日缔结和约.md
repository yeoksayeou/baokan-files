　　US Adjusts Butterworth to be Acheson's Assistant
　　Conspiracy Intensifies to Conclude a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The US government is intensifying its conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. According to a United Press International Washington dispatch: State Department spokesman McDermott announced on March 27 that Walter Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division with the rank of Assistant Secretary of State, "has been designated to work directly with Secretary of State Acheson, dedicating his full time to handling Japanese affairs; Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rusk will succeed Butterworth as Director of the Far Eastern Division with the rank of Assistant Secretary of State." UPI further quoted so-called authoritative sources in the US government as saying: "The purpose of designating Butterworth to devote all his time to handling Japanese affairs is to accelerate the work on the peace treaty with Japan." As is well known, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers, but the peace treaty with Japan that is said to be "accelerating" here, according to an Associated Press Washington dispatch of March 28, will be conducted by "Western countries on their own."

At the same time, under the auspices of the US authorities, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France are scheduled to hold a conference in London in May, and the issue of a separate peace treaty with Japan is also one of the main agenda items. According to a Reuters Washington dispatch of March 28: the London conference will decide to approve holding a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates.

    阴谋加紧单独对日缔结和约
    【新华社一日讯】美国政府正加紧其单独对日缔结和约的阴谋。据合众社华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人麦克德谟于三月二十七日宣布：国务院领助理国务卿官衔的远东司司长白德华，“已被指定直接与国务卿艾奇逊一道工作，用全部时间处理日本事务，副国务卿帮办鲁斯克将继白德华之后以助理国务卿官衔任远东司司长”。合众社又引所谓美国政府权威方面人士称：“指定白德华将全部时间从事处理日本问题的目的，是在于加紧进行对日和约的工作。”众所周知，根据波茨坦协定，对日和约应由外长会议准备，但是这里所说要“加紧进行”的对日和约，据美联社华盛顿三月二十八日电称：将由“西方国家自行进行。”
    同时，在美国当局的主持下，美英法三国已定于五月间在伦敦举行外长会议，单独对日缔结和约问题也为主要议程之一。据路透社华盛顿三月二十八日电称：伦敦会议将决定赞成早日举行对日和会，不论苏联是否参加。
