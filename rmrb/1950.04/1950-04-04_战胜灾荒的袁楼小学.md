　　Yuanlou Elementary School's Victory Over Disaster
　　Last autumn, Yutai County in Pingyuan Province suffered a severe flood, which affected many children's ability to attend school. The number of students at Yuanlou Elementary School in the Sixth District decreased from one hundred and twenty to thirty, and it was on the verge of collapse. At this time, the government issued instructions calling on all elementary schools to combine production with self-salvation and run the schools well. After receiving these instructions, the teachers of Yuanlou Elementary School discussed the situation with village cadres and the Communist Youth League, based on the actual situation in the village. They used family visits and mass meetings to publicize the principle of overcoming famine and running schools through combining production and education, persuading students' parents and mobilizing students to return to school. Nineteen members of the Communist Youth League also actively participated. After discussions by all teachers and students, it was decided to study and produce simultaneously. Classes were held for two sessions every morning and one session in the afternoon, with the remaining time devoted to production. The thirty-one students were divided into four groups: the leader of the first group was Liang Shenmin, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. Their plan was to get up early every morning to collect manure, and go to school to study when the sun came up. After school, they would carry the manure home. In the evening, each person would peel enough reeds to weave two mats. The leader of the second group was Communist Youth League member Zheng Baochun. This group planned to sweep five catties of leaves or collect manure every morning, and peel reeds for two mats each in the evening. The leader of the third group was female student Wang Xiuhuan. This group stipulated that each person should twist one catty of hemp wool rope in their spare time every day, and peel reeds for two mats in the evening. The fourth group, consisting of twelve younger students, was led by Zhao Xiting (a League member), who led the group members in peeling reeds for two mats each evening. Every evening, each group reported their production and learning progress to the teachers, who provided verbal praise and criticism as needed. In the evening, the students reviewed the day's lessons in groups and then went home to engage in sideline production. In addition, production committee members were elected at the village level to supervise and inspect. Teachers made home visits once a week, and held review meetings every Wednesday and Saturday to report and review production activities. They also used five small blackboards hanging on the street to praise and criticize at any time, stirring up competition. As a result of these efforts, each student collected enough manure each day to exchange for four to eight ounces of coarse grain, and the income from peeling reeds was ten to fifteen ounces of coarse grain. Their studies were not neglected either. Therefore, they were deeply supported by the students' parents, and the number of children attending school quickly increased to more than ninety, restoring and consolidating the Yuanlou Elementary School, which was on the verge of collapse.

　　战胜灾荒的袁楼小学
    去年秋天，平原省鱼台县遭受了严重水灾，影响得许多儿童不能上学。六区袁楼小学的学生由一百二十名减少到三十名，眼看就要垮台。这时候，政府发出了指示，号召各小学结合生产自救，办好小学。袁楼小学教员接到了这个指示后，就根据村中实际情况，和村干部及青年团进行了讨论；并利用家庭访问或群众会议，宣传结合生产渡荒办学的道理，说服学生家长，动员学生到校。十九名青年团员也积极活动。经全校师生开会讨论，决定一面学习，一面生产。每天上午上课两节，下午上课一节，其余时间进行生产。并将三十一名学生分编为四个组：第一组组长是青年团支部书记梁慎敏，他们的计划是：每天赶大清早起来拾粪，太阳出来就到校学习；放学时将粪背回家去；晚上，每人剥够编两领席用的苇子。第二组组长是青年团员郑保纯，该组计划每天早晨扫树叶子五斤或拾粪；晚上每人剥编两领席用的苇子。第三组组长是女生王秀桓，该组规定在课余每人每天搓一斤麻的毛窝绳，并在晚上剥编两领席的苇子。第四组十二名年纪较小的学生，由赵希庭（团员）任组长，领导组员每晚剥编两领席的苇子。每天傍晚，各组向教员汇报生产及学习情形，教员随时进行口头表扬和批评。晚上学生们分组将一天功课温习后，即回家进行副业生产。另外，以村为单位，选举了生产委员，负责督促检查。教员每周做家庭访问一次，每星期三和星期六开检讨会，汇报、检讨生产活动；并利用挂在街上的五块小黑板，随时表扬和批评，掀起竞赛。这样努力的结果，学生每人每天拾的粪，可换粗粮四两至半斤，剥苇子的收入可得粗粮十两至十五两；学习也没有耽误。因此深得学生家长的拥护，到校学习的儿童，很快就增加到了九十多名，使将要垮台的袁楼小学得到恢复和巩固。
