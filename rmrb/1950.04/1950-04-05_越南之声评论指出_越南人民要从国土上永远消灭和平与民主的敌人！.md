Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: The Voice of Vietnam commented on the great significance of "Celebrating the Day of Recognition of Vietnam by People's Democratic Countries" on the 3rd, stating: Following the celebration of "Vietnam-Soviet Union-China Friendship Day" on February 18th this year, April 4th will once again prove the attitude of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the world democratic camp. The Vietnamese people are increasingly convinced that nothing but world democracy and peace can guarantee the national independence of countries oppressed by international imperialism. They understand that today, when American warmongers and their allies, the international reactionaries, are busy preparing for a third world war to stop the national liberation movements in various colonies, it is even more important to defend peace and democracy. The Vietnamese revolutionary movement is part of the world revolution of oppressed peoples resisting imperialist countries. This revolution will surely lead the Vietnamese people to where the people's democratic countries in Asia and Europe will reach in the future. This is the great significance of the recognition of Vietnam by New China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries. With the selfless help of the Soviet Union, the people of Asia and Europe are actively building people's democratic regimes and supporting the people of other countries who are fighting against imperialist oppression.

The unity between democratic countries is a great driving force for the people of colonies and dependent countries now fighting against imperialism, especially for the people of Southeast Asia.

The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union will eventually defeat the imperialists headed by the American reactionaries. The Vietnamese people are now stepping up their struggle for national liberation in order to make more contributions to maintaining peace and democracy in Southeast Asia.

The Vietnamese people will use "Celebrating the Day of Recognition of Vietnam by People's Democratic Countries" to reiterate their determination to forever eliminate the enemies of peace and democracy from Indochina.

　　越南之声评论指出
    越南人民要从国土上永远消灭和平与民主的敌人！
    【新华社四日讯】越南通讯社北越讯：越南之声三日评论“庆祝承认越南的人民民主国家日”的重大意义称：继今年二月十八日庆祝了“越、苏、中友谊日”之后，四月四日将再度证明越南民主共和国在世界民主阵营中的态度。越南人民日益确信，除了世界的民主和平以外，什么都不能保证被国际帝国主义压迫的国家的民族独立。他们了解，今天在美国战争贩子及其同盟者国际反动派正忙于准备第三次世界大战以制止各殖民地民族解放运动的时候，保卫和平与民主就更加重要。越南的革命运动是被压迫的各国人民抵抗帝国主义国家的世界革命的一部分，这一革命将确定地把越南人民导向欧亚两洲人民民主国家在将来所要到达的地方。这即是新中国、苏联及其他人民民主国家承认越南的重大意义。在苏联的忘我的帮助之下，欧亚两洲的人民正积极建设人民民主政权和支援为反对帝国主义压迫而奋斗的其他各国人民。
    各民主国家间的团结一致，对于现在为反对帝国主义而战的殖民地与附属国人民，特别是对于东南亚的人民，是一种伟大的推动力。
    越南人民深信，以苏联为首的民主阵营最后必定战胜以美国反动派为首的帝国主义者。越南人民现在正加紧他们争取民族解放的斗争，以便在东南亚对维护和平与民主有更多的供献。
    越南人民将以“庆祝承认越南的人民民主国家日”再度重申他们从印度支那永远消灭和平与民主的敌人的决心。
