　　A Good Movie Introduction

　　Stalingrad Reborn
    (Soviet Film)
    Screening at the Ping An, Zhong He, Red Star, and Central theaters in Beijing starting April 3rd.

    The Soviet people had astonishing achievements in the war against the German invaders to defend their homeland. Especially in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Soviet people concentrated on showing their invincible strength, and it was in this battle that the situation was reversed.

    When the Red Army finally annihilated the remaining enemies in Stalingrad, marching southwest in great strides, liberating Eastern Europe, and pursuing the fleeing enemy, Stalingrad, deeply wounded, began its recovery and construction work.

    The war turned this beautiful and solemn city into a field of rubble. Young people, women, farmers, skilled and unskilled workers from all over the Soviet Union poured in. They came here with tools and even houses, determined to rebuild this ruin into a brand new city.

    As a result, power plants resumed power supply, steel mills' open-hearth furnaces produced steel, new tractors rolled out of the tractor factory, and brand-new houses were built one after another. Theaters also began new musical programs to comfort these builders.

    To commemorate May Day, all the builders of Stalingrad reviewed their strength and, faced with the amazing achievements created by their own hands, they felt extremely excited.

    This film is a vivid record of the people of Stalingrad restoring and building their city. It gives the Chinese working people infinite courage and confidence to overcome difficulties.

　　斯大林格勒复兴
    （苏联影片）
    于四月三日起在北京平安、中和、红星、中央诸影院上演
    苏联人民在反抗德国侵略者、保卫祖国的战争中，有着惊人的事绩。尤其在保卫斯大林格勒的战役中，苏联人民集中表现了不可战胜的力量，并且在这一战役中扭转了战局。
    当红军最后歼灭残留在斯大林格勒的敌人，大踏步向西南进军、解放东欧、追击逃敌时，创巨痛深的斯大林格勒就开始了它的恢复建设工作。
    战争把这座美丽而庄严的城市变成一片瓦砾场，苏联各地的青年们，妇女们，农民们，熟练和不熟练的工人们都涌来了，他们带着工具甚至带着房屋来到这里，决心把这一片废墟重建成一座崭新的城市。
    于是，发电厂恢复送电，钢铁厂马丁炉出钢了，从拖拉机厂开出新的拖拉机，簇新的房屋又一座座建筑起来，剧院也开始了新的音乐节目来慰问这些建设者。
    纪念五一节的时候，斯大林格勒的全体建设者们，检阅了自己的力量，面对着自己双手创造出的惊人业绩，他们感到极度的振奋。
    这部影片就是斯大林格勒人民恢复建设自己城市的生动纪录，它给与中国劳动人民以克服困难的无限勇气和信心。
