　　Tianjin Region Strengthens Suppression and Security Work
    Half a Year Sees Over 1,300 Cases Solved; Militia Organizations Consolidated and Developed
    [Report from this newspaper] The Tianjin Region has achieved significant results in its suppression and security work over the past six months (August of last year to February of this year), and has developed and consolidated its militia organizations. In terms of suppression: a total of 1,390 cases were solved (accounting for 65% of the cases that occurred), 1,561 bandits, spies, and major suspects were arrested, and 566 long and short guns were seized. During the work process, not only was the role of the militia brought into play, but the organization of the militia was greatly developed and consolidated. In the past six months, a total of 11,278 members (of which Party and Youth League members accounted for 24%) have been developed in 954 villages. As of the end of February, militia organizations had been established in 3,434 villages throughout the region, with a total of 32,834 members. 1,600 company commanders have been trained. However, a few cadres and members still have undesirable work styles, such as impurity, lack of discipline, lax leadership, and detachment from the masses. These bad habits must be vigorously corrected and overcome in the future. In particular, it is necessary to combine with production and consolidate the organization and transform the work style through production. In addition, some cadres currently lack sufficient political vigilance and urgently need to increase their awareness.

　　天津专区加强清剿治安工作
    半年破案千三百余件  民兵组织获巩固发展
    【本报讯】天津专区半年来（去年八月至今年二月）清剿治安工作获显著成绩，并发展与巩固了民兵组织。清剿方面：计破案一千三百九十件。（占发生案件百分之六十五），捕获土匪、特务及重大嫌疑犯一千五百六十一名，缴获长短枪五百六十六枝。在工作过程中，不仅发挥了民兵的作用，且大大发展与巩固了民兵的组织。半年来，在九百五十四个村庄中，共发展一万一千二百七十八个队员（内党、团员占百分之二十四）。截至二月底，全区已在三千四百三十四个村，建立了民兵组织，共队员三万二千八百三十四人。并训练中队长一千六百名。但在少数干部、队员中，仍有作风不纯、缺乏纪律、领导松懈和脱离群众等不良作风，今后须大力纠正与克服。特别是要结合生产，通过生产来巩固组织、改造作风。另外，目前尚有部分干部政治警惕性不够，亟须提高注意。
