　　On Ballad Singing Music
　　Ma Ke
　　On the morning of March 19th, we went to listen to the "Folk Art Research Concert." We were very happy to hear demonstration performances by many famous Beijing artists in three or four hours. In some ways, these performances gave us satisfaction that is often difficult to obtain even at ordinary concerts.
　　Chinese folk art seems to have had a considerable scale since the Song and Jin dynasties. At that time, the "Zaju" in "Washe" and the subsequent "Guzi Ci" and "Zhugong Diao" were very similar to our modern Tianqiao's acrobatics and various ballad singing forms, such as drum ballad, Qinshu, and single string. How their evolution has been over the past thousand years (I am mainly referring to the musical aspect) is something for which we do not yet have sufficient research data; but it can be said with certainty that after thousands of years of development, accumulating the experience of countless people and folk artists, there are unusually rich and valuable things hidden here. In recent years, general music workers have begun to pay attention to and study folk music, but the scope of research mostly still stays within folk songs and a small part of opera music, and very little attention is paid to ballad singing music. Naturally, there are also some objective reasons for this, such as the difficulty in notation, and in the past everyone did not have many opportunities to approach this part of the heritage, so many good things in it have not yet been discovered and valued. But now the conditions are different, and systematic research on ballad singing music will be put on our work agenda.
　　I think that in the Chinese folk music heritage, folk songs, ballad singing music, and drama music are three main components. Although tracing back to the source, the latter two are developed from the former, they have formed their own unique expressions and forms in the process of development. They constantly influence each other, but can never replace each other. Here, I would like to talk about my views on ballad singing music, for everyone's reference.
　　I think the biggest feature of ballad singing music is that it vividly expresses language.
　　That day, we heard the performances of Mr. Cao Baolu, Guan Xuezeng, and others, and the first sentence aroused appreciative laughter from everyone. I think this is definitely not just the effect of the content of the lyrics, but also the effect of the music and the effect of the performance. The audience's appreciation is because Mr. Cao, Guan, and others made the lyrics more vivid, more graphic, and more expressive through their performances. This immediately reminded me of some of our vocalists, who have also tried their best to convey the enthusiasm in their hearts to the audience, but because they only one-sidedly emphasized the effect of the sound and did not give play to the characteristics of the language, they could not hear that kind of cordial and visualized language in their singing, and could not be infected by their enthusiasm, which is such an unfortunate thing! If a vocalist does not first master the language, how can he further talk about expressing emotion!
　　Speaking of mastering the language, some people think that it is only a matter of pronunciation, as long as you pay attention to the four tones, but in fact, how can it be so mechanical and simple! Mr. Lian Kuoru, who tells Ping Shu (storytelling), said: "When I tell the story of the Heroes of the Three Kingdoms, I play Cao Cao for a while, Zhou Yu for a while, Zhuge Liang for a while, and then millions of soldiers and horses - I alone top a million troops." Although he was referring to storytelling, isn't it the same in ballad singing music such as drum ballad and single string! When we listen to Liu Baoquan's "The Western Chamber," we feel that many touching parts of his performance lie in his ability to use the language familiar to the masses extremely skillfully. He pays attention to the changes in tone and tune, he pays attention to characterization, and he can express the things he feels in life vividly and centrally through musical language, and the audience can be infected by the breath of life from some parts of his performance. (Of course, in his performance, there is also another part that follows the old drum ballad to express the rigid and lifeless language of the life and feelings of the scholar-official class, which is precisely the part where he lacks creativity.) He also exaggerates, but does not deviate from reality; he also embellishes the language to make it more beautiful, but in the final analysis, it is always combined with the Chinese language of life. Can these be solved simply by pronunciation? And can it be appreciated by people who specialize in so-called "bel canto"?
　　Just this point alone is already worth learning for our vocalists. If we do not solve the problem of how to express language well in our vocal work in the future, I think it will be difficult to improve the work.
　　The Chinese language has its own set of rules, but this does not mean that only one form is used in all ballad singing music to express this rule. On the contrary, various ballad singing music have their own unique features in terms of expression. Generally speaking, some are more strict in rhythm and tune, and notation is easier, such as plum blossom drum ballad, Fengtian drum ballad, and Henan Zhui Zi. Some are very free in rhythm and tune, and notation is difficult, or completely impossible to notate - here we can only blame our modern notation method for not being able to fully meet our requirements, but we should not belittle this kind of music. On the contrary, there is rich music here, and there is a wonderful combination of music and language: like Liu Baoquan's music, sometimes it is so low and melodious, sometimes it is so慷慨激昂, integrated with the language and integrated; like Guan Xuezeng's music, in the background of clear and bright piano accompaniment, it sets off the recitation that is closer to natural language, but at the end of each sentence, it cleverly turns to a fixed tune; like Cao Baolu's music, it uses various different tunes to enrich the expressive ability of the music... In short, every kind of ballad singing music, and even every performer, can express different styles and different moods. Such a rich expression method is very worthy of some of our comrades who only know how to study music from sheet music.
　　Because ballad singing music has so successfully solved the problems of music and language, it also provides extremely useful reference for our creation of drama music.
　　If drama music and ballad singing music were initially developed from folk songs, then ballad singing music often becomes (although not necessarily) the bridge in this development. From the folk songs, Daqu, and Bianwen of the Tang Dynasty → the Zaju and Yuanben of the Song and Jin Dynasties → Yuanqu, this process can be seen as a glimpse of the development track of folk songs → ballad singing music → drama music; in recent times, many folk popular small dramas such as Sawing the Big Vat, Wang Da Niang Visiting the Sick, Wang Po Cursing the Chicken... are all from folk songs → story songs with ballad singing music nature → plus simple performances and makeup to become the most primitive small opera. The folk song and dance drama "Errenzhuan" (or "Dibengzi") in Northeast China more clearly shows this process: the earliest form of "Errenzhuan" was almost entirely ballad singing, and even now it still retains a part of the ballad singing form. (such as "Jinban," such as the representative form of singing, etc.) The development of Yue Opera in Zhejiang is said to be similar; in the music of the Jidong shadow puppet show, there are also paragraphs of "Kuaishu Tune." Originally, the development of Chinese old opera was based on folk songs and ballad singing music. It absorbed the excellent experience of folk songs and ballad singing music. Without this part of the experience, it can be said that the form of drama music cannot be finally completed.
　　At present, the creation of new opera is mostly based on folk songs and mass songs. For further expressing the more dramatic plot, it is often felt that it is not competent. Therefore, the audience reflects that the music of the new opera is too bland and too fragmented and they are not satisfied. A new problem is placed in front of the composers: to improve the music of the new opera. Improving it, of course, must first be pursued from the emotional content, which will not be discussed here for the time being, but in terms of the form problem (and this problem is closely related to the expression of emotional content and difficult to separate), further processing is also needed. This requires composers to break through the small circle of folk songs and the forms of general mass songs and create new drama music forms. Instead of completely imitating the practices in Western opera and imitating people's "Aria" and "Recitative" in this creative work (naturally, we never oppose studying the experience of Western opera as our own reference), it is better to learn more from our national heritage. Here, in addition to the existing achievements in the old opera, what is particularly important is to absorb the nourishment of ballad singing music and accept the good experience of the combination of music and language in ballad singing music.
　　As for whether ballad singing music itself can be developed a step further, I think it can be, not only can it be, but it is also necessary. Our music workers should take on this responsibility well. In the past, we have done very little work in this area, or we have done a little, but we have not linked it to comrades in the folk art circle. In the future, I hope to improve this situation. As for some comrades who look down on ballad singing music and think it is too simple and rough, this is very wrong. As Comrade Zhao Shuli criticized in his closing remarks that day, this is a very wrong attitude towards our national cultural heritage. Our hardworking and wise ancestors have left us an extremely rich cultural heritage for thousands of years, and these various ballad singing music are undoubtedly a part of this heritage. We will build our nation's new culture on the excellent traditions of the old culture. Drum ballad, Zhui Zi, Qinshu... can be enriched and further developed in terms of tunes, accompaniment, and singing, and even insert large choirs to create new ballad singing or new large chorus for the people. Its scale can reach the same level as the successful large chorus written by that young musician in the "Siberian Symphony"! As far as I know, some of our composing comrades also hold this ideal and have made some attempts. In the future, we are willing to better cooperate with comrades in poetry work and comrades in folk art work, study old folk art, and strive to create new ballad singing music and new large chorus!

　　关于说唱音乐
    马可
    三月十九日上午我们去听了“曲艺研究演唱会”。在三四个钟头内听到北京许多名艺员的示范演唱，我们非常高兴。从某些方面说，这些演唱给了我们在一般音乐会上也常难于得到的满足。
    中国的曲艺，似乎从宋金时起就已具备了相当的规模，当时“瓦肆”里的“杂剧”，及其后的“鼓子词”、“诸宫调”等，很像我们现代天桥的杂耍和各种说唱，如大鼓、琴书、单弦之类。在这近千年来的历史中，它们的演变情形如何，（我说的主要指音乐方面），我们还未有足够的研究资料；但是可以肯定的说：经过千百年来的发展，积累了无数群众和民间艺人的经验，这里是蕴藏了异常丰富而可贵的东西的。近年来，一般音乐工作者都开始重视并研究民间音乐，但研究的范围，大都还停留在民歌和一少部分戏曲音乐的圈子里，对于说唱音乐，注意的非常不够。这自然也有一些客观原因，如记谱上的困难，和过去大家对这部分遗产接近的机会还不多，因而其中很多好的东西还未被发掘和重视。但现在条件是不同了，对说唱音乐有系统的研究，将被提到我们的工作日程上来。
    我以为，在中国民间音乐遗产中，民歌、说唱音乐和戏剧音乐是三个主要的构成部分，虽然追本求源，后二者还是由前者发展而来，但在发展过程中它们已经形成了各自独特的表现方法和表现形式，它们不断的互相影响，但决不能互相代替。这里，我想谈谈我对说唱音乐的看法，以待大家参考。
    我觉得，说唱音乐最大的一个特点，是在于它生动的表现了语言。
    那一天，我们听到曹宝禄、关学增等先生的演唱，开口一句，就引起了大家赞赏的笑声，我想这决不仅是歌词内容上的效果，也是音乐上的效果，演唱上的效果。听众之所以赞赏，是因为曹、关等先生通过他们的演唱，使得歌词更生动，更形象，更富有表现力。这使我马上联想到我们有些声乐家，他们也曾竭尽心力的要把自己胸中的热情传达给听众，但由于他们仅片面的强调了声音的效果，没有发挥语言的特点，因此在他们的歌声中就听不到那种亲切的形象化的话语，感染不到他的热情，这是多么不幸的事！如果一个声乐家不首先掌握了语言，怎能进一步谈到表现感情！
    说到掌握语言，有人以为仅仅是咬字问题，只要注意一下四声就行了，其实哪里有这样机械和简单！说评书的连阔如先生说：“我说群英会时，一会儿扮成曹操，一会儿扮成周瑜，一会儿扮成诸葛亮，一会儿又扮成百万兵马——我一个人顶上了百万大军”。他这话虽然指的说评书，但在大鼓、单弦等说唱音乐上又何尝不是如此！我们听了刘宝全的《大西厢》，感觉到在他的演唱中很多动人处就在于他能够极为纯熟的使用群众所熟习的语言，他注意语气和腔调的变化，他注意性格化的描写，他能够把在生活中感受的事物通过音乐化的语言形象的、集中的表现出来，听众能够从他的某些部分演唱中感染到生活的气息。（当然，在他的演唱中也有另一部分因循着旧的鼓词表现士大夫阶级生活情调的僵硬无生气的语言，这正是他缺少创造的部分。）他也夸张，但不脱离现实；他也把语言给以煊染，使之美化，但归根到底总还是结合着生活的中国语言。这些，岂仅仅是咬字所能解决得了的吗？又岂是专门讲究所谓“美声”的人们所能体会得到的吗？
    单就这一点说，就已很值得我们的声乐家们学习的了，如果在今后我们的声乐工作中，不很好的解决如何表现语言问题，我以为是很难使工作提高一步的。
    中国语言有它自身的一套规律，但这并不是说，在一切说唱音乐中都只采用一种形式来表现这种规律，而是恰恰相反，各种说唱音乐在表现形式上，又都有其独到之处。大体上说来，有的是在节奏和曲调上都较严整，记谱也较为容易，如梅花大鼓、奉天大鼓、河南坠子等。有的是在节奏上和曲调上非常自由，记谱较难，或者完全无法记谱——这里只能怪我们现代的记谱法还不能完全满足我们的要求，却不应贬低这种音乐。而且恰恰相反，这里有着丰富的音乐，有着音乐与语言的美妙结合：像刘宝全的音乐，有时是那样低回婉转，有时是那样慷慨激昂，与语言浑然一体、融会贯通；像关学增的音乐，那样在清晰明朗的琴声伴奏的背景中，衬托出较接近自然语言的朗诵，但在每句煞尾，又巧妙的转到固定的曲调上来；像曹宝禄的音乐那样利用各种不同的曲牌，来丰富音乐上的表现能力……总之，每一种说唱音乐，甚至每一个演唱的人，都能表现出不同的风格，不同的情调，这样丰富的表现方法，是非常值得我们一些只知道从乐谱上一板一眼的研究音乐的同志们好好学习的。
    由于说唱音乐这样成功的解决了音乐与语言上的问题，因此对于我们在戏剧音乐的创造上，也提供了极为有益的参考。
    假如说戏剧音乐、说唱音乐最初都是从民歌的基础上发展起来的话，那么往往是（虽然不必一定是）说唱音乐成为这个发展中的桥梁。远一点说，从唐代的民歌、大曲、变文—→宋金的杂剧、院本—→元曲，这个过程略可窥见民歌—→说唱音乐—→戏剧音乐的发展轨迹；近一点说，许多民间流行的小剧如锯大缸、王大娘探病、王婆骂鸡……之类莫不是由民歌—→带说唱音乐性质的故事歌—→加上简单的表演和化装成为最原始的小歌剧。东北民间的歌舞剧《二人传》（或称“地蹦子”）更明显的表示出这个过程：《二人传》最初的形式殆全是说唱，直到现在还保留着一部分的说唱形式。（如“紧板”，如演唱的代言体等）浙江越剧的发展，据说也有类此情形；冀东皮影戏的音乐中，还有成段的“快书调”。原来中国旧歌剧的发展，是兼在民歌与说唱音乐的基础上的，它吸收了民歌与说唱音乐的优良经验，没有这部分经验，可以说戏剧音乐的形式不能最后完成。
    目前新歌剧的创作，大都还是在民歌和群众歌曲的基础上，对于进一步表现戏剧性较强的情节，往往感到不能胜任，因此听众们反映新歌剧的音乐太平淡、太零碎，不满足。一个新的问题摆在作曲者的面前：要把新歌剧的音乐提高一步。提高一步，当然首先是要从感情内容上来追求的，这里暂且不谈，但在形式问题上（而这问题又与表现感情内容关系密切难分）也需要进一步的加工。这就需要作曲者们冲破民歌和一般群众歌曲形式上的小圈子，创造新的戏剧音乐形式。这种创造工作，与其去全部仿照西洋歌剧中的做法，模仿人家的“咏叹调”（Aria）和“宣叙调”（Recitative），（自然，我们决不反对研究西洋歌剧的经验以作为自己的借鉴）倒不如更多的向我们的民族遗产来学习。这里，除了旧戏中已有的成就外，特别重要的就是吸取说唱音乐的滋养，接受说唱音乐中音乐与语言结合的良好经验。
    至于在说唱音乐本身，能不能再发展一步，我想是可以的，不仅是可以，而且是必需的。这个责任我们音乐工作者应该好好的担负起来。过去这方面的工作我们做得很少，或者是做了一点，没有与曲艺界同志联系起来，今后我希望能够改善这种情况。至于有些同志瞧不起说唱音乐，认为它太简单，粗糙，这是十分不对的，像那天赵树理同志在闭会词上所批评的，这是对待我们的民族文化遗产的一种十分错误的态度。我们勤劳而智慧的祖先，数千年来给我们留传下来极为丰富的文化遗产，这些各种各样的说唱音乐无疑也是这遗产中的一部分，我们将在旧文化中的优良传统上建立起我们民族的新文化来。大鼓、坠子、琴书……是可以在曲调上、伴奏上、演唱上更加丰富，更加发展，甚至于插入大合唱队，创造出人民的新说唱或新的大合唱来，其规模何尝不可达到“西伯利亚交响乐”中那位青年音乐家所写的那个成功的大合唱一样！就我所知，我们也有一些作曲的同志抱着这种理想，并曾作过一些尝试。今后我们愿意更好的和诗歌工作同志和曲艺工作同志们合作，研究旧曲艺，努力创作新的说唱音乐和新的大合唱！
