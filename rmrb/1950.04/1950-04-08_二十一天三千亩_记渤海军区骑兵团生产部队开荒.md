Twenty-One Days, Three Thousand Mu
    — A Record of the Bohai Military Region Cavalry Regiment's Production Unit Reclaiming Wasteland
    Xu Lin
            I. "No New Year for Us!"
    On the morning of the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month, the production unit of the Bohai Military Region Cavalry Regiment set off for Dongwa.

    The soldiers felt as tense as if they were going to the battlefield, determined to "Respond to Chairman Mao's call, fulfill the promise made during the challenge, and make contributions on the production front!" The political commissar's mobilization speech before departure also echoed in their minds: "Strictly observe discipline, unite and help each other, take good care of farm tools, be patient and endure hardship, and complete the task!" The next day after arriving at the garrison, intense and busy preparations began: seeds, provisions, farm tools, horse fodder, materials...

    Another particularly important task was to open up the road from the garrison to the production destination – Xiaosha. The direct route from the garrison to Xiaosha was only forty li, but it went through a deserted swamp that no one had ever traversed. If they detoured west, it would be one hundred and twenty li, which would make the transportation of seeds, farm tools, and provisions a serious problem that would be difficult to solve. However, determination and perseverance conquered everything. In three days, we took compasses and explored like adventurers, opening up the first safe shortcut to the east.

    At the end of the old year, the weather suddenly warmed up, and the silted land had to be planted quickly, because when the ice and snow melted, the land would become a thin layer of mud that people and horses could not step on. The soldiers demanded, "No New Year, production is the priority! Let's set off to the fields immediately!"

            II. Tense Eight Days
    On the third day after arriving at the destination, the ice melted, and sowing began.

    According to the scientifically organized plan, each squad was divided into three mutual aid groups, each group with one seed drill, and twenty or so drills worked back and forth in rows and columns.

    The top layer of the land was an inch-thick layer of clay, under which was a layer of ice, and under that was deep slurry. If one was not careful and fell into an ice crack, one would sink to the knees. A good pair of shoes would not last long in the fields, and socks were even less useful. Many soldiers simply took off their shoes, rolled up their trouser legs, and sowed vigorously with bare feet.

    "Political Commissar Xi is here!" the soldiers called out from afar. Political Commissar Xi, his face covered with dust, grabbed Comrade Wang Anchen's horse as soon as he arrived in the field and said, "Let me do it!" Comrade Wang Anchen held on tightly and refused to let go, "Political Commissar, Political Commissar, you just arrived, rest for a while and then work, let me do it..." Yes, Political Commissar Xi was too tired. For more than ten days, he hadn't stopped for a moment. He organized and inspected all the material preparations in the rear, and then went to organize and inspect the transportation. When he heard that the ground had opened for sowing, he rushed down again. Finally, Political Commissar Xi snatched the horse and started sowing, his cotton shoes fell off, and he was just wearing socks. People barely managed to get him to change places, and he ran to another group to replace the soldiers of the Third Company.

    Instructor Sun Fengchen arrived. He was in charge of supplies and life. He had just unloaded the eight truckloads of supplies that had arrived today and sent the transportation comrades to eat. He rushed to work in the fields.

    When dusk fell and the night mist was heavy, the soldiers raised torches high, as signals to prevent their comrades in the field from getting lost.

    At night, the squad meetings began. First, they reviewed the advantages, disadvantages, and experiences of the day's production, and then reported and recorded merits and broadcast them.

    During free time, the soldiers said, "Look, our food and lodging are really uncomfortable, but when we think that production is Chairman Mao's call, we can't taste the bitterness even if we eat coptis!" "Thinking about building our country, we are not afraid of any hardship, and our energy comes!"

            III. Assault – Final Victory
    It was the ninth day of the first lunar month. The weather had warmed up, and there was already standing water in the fields that had been sown a few days earlier. Even the soldiers' courtyards had become soft mud. In a few more days, it would be impossible to live here at all. Therefore, they had to decide on a final "assault."

    At 7:00 a.m., nineteen drills set off separately. The cold wind of the night had frozen a thin layer of ice on the surface of the ground, but underneath was soft, thin mud. When people stepped on it, they sank to their knees, and mud splashed up to their waists. The horses struggled to pull their hooves out of the mud. Once that thin layer of ice was lifted by the drill legs, it flew wildly in the wind, stinging the feet.

    On this day, everyone did their best to complete the arduous task of the last day. By ten o'clock, they had sown more than three hundred mu. Comrade Sun Fengchen's drill alone had sown six bags of seeds.

    This group of eighty-one people, after completing their final task, left the camp they had built themselves. In eight days, they sacrificed their holidays, endured all kinds of hardships, and without a single sick person or a single straggler, completed the glorious task of planting three thousand three hundred mu. At this time, everyone's hearts blossomed. They believed in the folk proverb and their own experience: "If you want to have something, follow the Yellow River!" "Yellow River silt is a granary for wheat." They knew clearly that in a dozen days, the water would recede, and the seeds would germinate. Three months later, they would return, and what would the scene be like then? – Green peas, golden barley, this is the Nanniwan of Bohai.

　　二十一天三千亩
    —记渤海军区骑兵团生产部队开荒
    许林
            一、“不过年了！”
    旧历十二月二十日的清晨，渤海军区骑兵团的生产部队，出发到东洼去了。
    战士们的心里都象上战场般的紧张，都下着决心：“响应毛主席号召，执行挑战时的诺言、在生产战线上立功！”出发前政委的动员也盘旋在脑子里：“严守纪律、团结互助、爱护农具、吃苦耐心、完成任务！”
    到达驻地的第二天，紧张繁忙的准备工作就开始了：种子、给养、农具、马草、料……。
    另一项特别重要的任务，就是打通从驻地到生产目的地——小沙的道路。从驻地到小沙直走只有四十里的路程，但这中间是一个从没有人迹通过的荒洼，假若转路西上，就需要一百二十里，那么种子、农具、给养的运输就是一个不好解决的严重问题，但决心和毅力征服了一切，我们以三天的工夫，带上指南针，探险家似的开辟了东去的第一条安全的捷径。
    旧年底，天气突然暖和起来，淤地要抢种，到冰消雪尽时，地里就成了一片人马不能踏入的薄泥了。战士们提出要求：“不过年，生产要紧！马上出发到地里去！”
            二、紧张的八天
    到达目的地的第三天，冰化了，耩地开始了。
    按着事前科学的组织，每班分成三个互助组，每组一张耧，二十来张耧一排排、一列列的来回忙碌着。
    地里最上层是寸来厚的胶泥，底下是冰层，再底下又是深深的泥浆，一个不小心掉到冰缝里，就踩到膝盖。一双很好的鞋子在地里走上几遭就穿不住了，袜子更不管用，许多战士就干脆光着脚挽起裤腿，耩的起劲。
    “席政委来了！”战士们老远就招呼开了。席政委满脸风尘，到地里就一把拉着王安臣同志的马说：“我来！”王安臣同志死死地拉着不放：“政委，政委你才来休息会再干，我来，我……”是的，席政委太累了，十来天了他没一霎住脚，在后方组织检查了一切物质筹备，又去组织检查运输，听说地上开了耩，他又急忙跑下来。终于，席政委夺过马来耩开了，掉了棉鞋光穿着袜子。人们勉强把他换下来，他又跑到另一组去替三连的战士。
    孙凤臣指导员来了，他是供给和生活指挥者，刚刚卸完了今天运来的八大车东西，打发运输的同志们吃了饭，他抢着来下地。
    当黄昏夜雾沉沉的时候，战士们就高举起火把，这是恐怕在地里的同志们迷了路，放的连络信号。
    入夜，班务会开始了。他们首先检讨一天生产中的优缺点和经验，接着就是报功、记功和广播。
    自由活动时，战士们说：“看咱吃的、住的实在是不好受，但一想到生产是毛主席的号召，是黄连也尝不出苦来！”“想到建设咱们的国家，一切劳累都不怕，劲头就来了！”
            三、突击——最后胜利
    是旧历正月初九，天已经暖和了，在前几天刚刚耩过的地里已有汪汪的水，就连战士们的院子里，也成了软软的泥水了，再过几天，这里就根本不能住人了。于是，不得不决定最后“突击”。
    早七点，十九张耩就分头出发了，一夜寒风又把地皮上冻了一层薄冰，下面已是软软的稀泥，人一跺没到膝盖，泥水溅到当腰，马都费力的拔着四只蹄子。那一层薄冰一经耩腿掀起后，在狂风里刷刷的乱飞，打在脚上刺刺发疼。
    这天，大家都尽了一切的努力，完成了最后一天的艰巨任务，到十点钟，就耩了三百多亩，孙凤臣同志的一张耧光种子耩了六布袋。
    他们一行八十一人，在完成了最后的任务后，离开了自己建造的营房，八天中，他们牺牲了假日，吃尽了辛苦，没有一个病号，没有一个落伍，完成了种地三千三百亩的光荣任务。这时大家的心都开了花，他们相信群众的古谚和自己的经验：“要想有，跟着黄河走！”“黄河淤是麦子囤”。他们清楚：在十几天之后，水就下去，种子要发芽。三个月后，他们还要回来，那时候将是怎样的情景？——绿油油的豌豆，金黄的大麦，这里是渤海的南泥湾。
