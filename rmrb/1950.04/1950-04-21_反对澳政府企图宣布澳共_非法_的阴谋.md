　　Oppose the Australian Government's Conspiracy to Declare the Australian Communist Party "Illegal"
    In order to suppress the people's democratic forces for reactionary purposes, the Australian government, following the outrageous sentencing of Sharkey, General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, to three years imprisonment on October 17 last year, is now conspiring to further persecute the Australian Communist Party by shamelessly declaring it "illegal." The Australian government has decided to submit a bill declaring the Australian Communist Party "illegal" to the Australian Federal Parliament. The farce of the Australian Federal Parliament reconvening on April 19 to discuss and pass this reactionary bill will soon begin. We, the Chinese people, like the Australian people, firmly oppose this outrageous step by the Australian government to attack the democratic rights of the Australian people.
    We clearly know that this persecution of the Australian Communist Party by the reactionary Australian government is in fact being carried out under the direct command of its American master and is closely linked to the dirty plan of American imperialism to turn Australia into an American war base. On January 19 this year, American Far East Air Force Commander Stratemeyer visited Australia and discussed with the Australian government the coordination of military preparations between the United States and Australia in the Pacific, stipulating Australia's position in the overall American military strategy. The day before this, on January 18, Australian Foreign Minister Spender announced: "The Australian government is preparing to declare the Australian Communist Party illegal." The simultaneous occurrence of these two events is by no means accidental. American imperialism regards the Australian Communist Party as an important obstacle to the implementation of its plan to enslave the Australian people. The Australian government's shameless persecution of the Australian Communist Party precisely illustrates the increasing intensification of American imperialist aggression against Australia.
    It should be pointed out that this kind of ugly drama of persecuting communists, directed by American imperialism, is being staged not only in Australia but also in other places. The reactionary governments of South American countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia have recently successively declared communist parties illegal. In Asia, the Japanese government is also doing its utmost to persecute the Communist Party. The unreasonable summons and framing of Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, is part of the anti-communist plan of American imperialism and its running dogs. The basic purpose of these actions by reactionaries in various countries is to make it easier to place these countries under the enslavement of American monopoly capitalists in order to serve the American war plan.
    But the reactionaries will never achieve their goals. The Communist Parties and people of various countries with a strong fighting will can never be subdued by a mere "illegal" decree. The Australian people, after the Australian government announced its "preparation to declare the Australian Communist Party illegal," not only did not weaken their struggle in the slightest but instead strengthened their struggle, which is the most vivid proof. The All-Australia Peace Congress, which closed in Melbourne on April 19, has announced that they will do everything in their power to oppose the Australian government's attack on the people's democratic rights and to oppose American imperialist aggression against Australia. The Australian working class has responded to the government's provocation with heroic strikes and the election of communists and progressives to leadership positions in trade unions. The people of other countries are also carrying out struggles to resist the persecution of communists in the same way. These facts tell us that no matter what slanders and pressures the reactionaries adopt, the people who love freedom and justice will always stand on the side of the Communist Parties of various countries!

### 反对澳政府企图宣布澳共“非法”的阴谋

　　反对澳政府企图宣布澳共“非法”的阴谋
    澳大利亚政府为了镇压人民民主力量的反动目的，继去年十月十七日横暴判处澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基三年徒刑之后，现在又阴谋以宣布澳大利亚共产党“非法”的无耻办法来进一步迫害澳大利亚共产党。澳大利亚政府已决定将宣布澳共“非法”的法案提交澳大利亚联邦议会。澳大利亚联邦议会已于四月十九日再度开会，讨论和通过这一反动法案的丑剧不久即将开始。对于澳大利亚政府进攻澳大利亚人民民主权利的这一横暴步骤，我们中国人民和澳大利亚人民同样地表示坚决的反对。
    我们清楚知道，澳大利亚反动政府对于澳共的这一迫害行动，事实上是在其美国主人的直接指挥下进行的，是和美国帝国主义变澳大利亚为美国战争基地的肮脏计划密切联系在一起的。今年一月十九日美国驻远东空军司令斯特拉特梅耶访问了澳大利亚，与澳政府讨论了美、澳两国在太平洋上军事准备的配合问题，规定了澳洲在美国全盘军事战略中的地位。而在这前一天，即一月十八日，澳外长斯宾德即宣布了：“澳政府准备宣布澳共为非法。”这两件事的同时发生，决非偶然。美国帝国主义把澳大利亚共产党看作是实行其奴役澳大利亚人民的计划的重要障碍。澳大利亚政府对澳大利亚共产党的无耻迫害，正说明了美国帝国主义对澳大利亚侵略的日益加紧。
    应该指出的是，由美国帝国主义所指挥这种迫害共产党的丑剧，不单在澳大利亚，而且也在其他地方演出。南美巴西、巴拉圭、智利、秘鲁及玻利维亚等国反动政府最近皆已相继宣布共产党为非法。在亚洲，日本政府也在极力迫害共产党。日本共产党总书记德田球一的被无理传讯诬陷，就是美帝国主义及其走狗的反共计划的一部分。各国反动派这些行动的基本目的，就是为了更便于把这些国家置于美国独占资本家的奴役之下，以服务于美国的战争计划。
    但是反动派是决难达到他们的目的的。具有坚强战斗意志的各国共产党和人民决不是一纸“非法”令即可压服的。澳大利亚人民在澳政府宣布“准备宣布澳共为非法”后，不但未丝毫减弱他们的斗争，反而更加强了他们的斗争，即是最生动的证明。四月十九日在墨尔本闭幕的全澳和平大会已经宣布他们将以全力来反对澳政府对于人民民主权利的进攻，反对美国帝国主义对澳大利亚的侵略。澳大利亚工人阶级更以英勇的罢工和选举共产党人与进步分子担任工会的领导职务的行动，来回答政府的挑衅。其他国家的人民也在同样地进行反抗迫害共产党的斗争。这些事实告诉我们，不管反动派采取什么诬蔑和高压，爱好自由和正义的人民，永远是站在各国共产党这一边的！
