Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: The latest issue of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, No. 26 (Total No. 65), includes the following important content: Editorial "Criticism and Self-Criticism are the Laws of Development for the Communist Party," "On the Situation of the Norwegian Communist Party" by E. Lovlien, Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, "The Tito Gang is a Cunning Enemy of the Spanish People" by D. Ibarruri, General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, and "American Imperialism Uses the Tito Group to Engage in Espionage Activities in Asia" (this article was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on February 10th). In addition, the publication contains an introduction to Lakolov's book "Against Left-Wing Sectarianism and Trotskyism in Bulgaria," information on the world peace movement, Czechoslovakia's production achievements last year, the Polish Workers' Party Central Party School, and reports on the situation in China.

"On the Situation of the Norwegian Communist Party" is an important source of information for understanding the development history of the Norwegian Party in recent years. In this article, E. Lovlien, Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, provides extremely important discussions on the bourgeois nationalist policies implemented by the anti-Party sectarian group headed by former Norwegian Communist Party General Secretary Fruubot during the Second World War and after the war, and the current situation of the Norwegian Party in correcting this error. The article pointed out that the Norwegian Communist Party conducted a fierce struggle against Fruubot's anti-Party group in October last year, and successively expelled Fruubot and other anti-Party elements from the Party. The article pointed out that one of the urgent tasks facing the Norwegian Communist Party is to eliminate anti-Party elements and consolidate its ranks ideologically and organizationally.

The book review on the late Bulgarian Workers' Party former General Secretary Kolarov's "Against Left-Wing Sectarianism and Trotskyism in Bulgaria" briefly introduces the history of the activities of the Trotskyite spy group headed by Kostov, and the process of the Bulgarian Workers' Party's struggle against them. The anti-Party Trotskyite group within the Bulgarian Party took the form of left-wing sectarianism, which is different from the open right-wing opportunism adopted by the sectarian group within the Norwegian Communist Party, but their harm to the workers' parties of the two countries is equally serious. The lessons of both are beneficial to the revolutionary ranks of the working class around the world.

The article "The Tito Gang is a Cunning Enemy of the Spanish People" exposes the Tito gang's ongoing conspiracy against the Spanish people. The article cites facts to prove that Franco knew long ago that Tito was an undercover agent of the German intelligence agencies. The article says: "Tito is seeking support from among the exiled 'well-wishers of the Spanish Republican government' to carry out his policy of deceiving and deceiving the Yugoslav people," and the Spanish Republican government's awarding of medals to Tito, on the other hand, has helped international intelligence agencies in the activities among the Spanish diaspora and within Spain. The article demands that the so-called Republican government, which is now in London and completely detached from the Spanish people, resign, and calls for the establishment of a Spanish Republican government that is truly representative and severs any ties with the Tito gang.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第廿六期内容介绍
    【新华社十日讯】在最近出版的共产党与工人党情报局机关刊物《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第二十六期（总第六十五期）中，重要的内容包括：社论《批评与自我批评是共产党的发展规律》，挪威共产党主席Ｅ·莱甫莲的《论挪威共产党的情况》，西班牙共产党总书记Ｄ·伊巴露丽的《铁托匪帮是西班牙人民的狡诈的敌人》，以及《美帝利用铁托集团在亚洲从事间谍活动》（该文已由新华社于二月十日广播）。此外，该刊载有关于拉科罗夫《反对保加利亚的左倾宗派主义与托洛斯基主义》一书的介绍，关于世界和平运动情况，捷克去年生产成就，波兰工人党中央党校，以及关于中国情况的报道。
    《论挪威共产党的情况》是了解挪威党近年发展历史的重要资料。挪威共产党主席莱甫莲在文中，对挪共前总书记佛鲁波达为首的反党宗派主义集团在第二次世界大战期间和战后所实行资产阶级民族主义政策，及目前挪威党纠正这一错误的情形，有极重要的论述。该文指出，挪共于去年十月与佛鲁波达的反党集团进行了激烈的斗争，并将佛鲁波达及其他若干反党分子陆续开除出党。该文指出：挪威共产党所面临的一项紧迫任务，即是清除反党分子，从思想上和组织上巩固自己的队伍。
    关于新近逝世的保加利亚工人党前总书记科拉罗夫所著的《反对保加利亚的左倾宗派主义与托洛斯基主义》一书的书评，扼要地介绍了该书所论述的以科斯托夫为首的托派间谍集团的活动历史，和保加利亚工人党与他们进行斗争的经过。保加利亚党内的反党托派集团采取左倾宗派主义的形式，这与挪威共产党内的宗派集团所采取的公开的右倾机会主义的形式不同，但其对两国工人阶级政党的危害同样严重。两者的教训，对于全世界工人阶级的革命队伍都是有益的。
    《铁托匪帮是西班牙人民的狡诈的敌人》一文揭露铁托匪帮正进行反对西班牙人民的阴谋活动。该文引据事实证明佛朗哥老早就知道铁托是德国特务机关的暗探。该文说：铁托正从流亡的“西班牙共和政府的好利的人们中间寻求支持，来进行他的欺骗蒙蔽南斯拉夫人民的政策”，而西班牙共和政府授勋给铁托一事，在另一方面又帮助了国际特务机关在西班牙侨民中和西班牙国内的活动。该文要求现在伦敦的完全脱离西班牙人民群众的所谓共和政府辞职，并号召成立一个具有真正代表性的、与铁托匪帮断绝任何联系的西班牙共和政府。
