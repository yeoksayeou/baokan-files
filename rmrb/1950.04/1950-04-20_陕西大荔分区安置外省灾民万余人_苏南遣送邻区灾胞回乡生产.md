Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 18th. Shaanxi Province's Dali Prefecture has properly resettled over ten thousand disaster victims who moved in from other provinces. Since last October, more than 12,000 disaster victims from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other places have successively migrated to Dali Prefecture. After the disaster victims arrived, government working cadres in various parts of the prefecture personally went to the disaster victim settlements to express their condolences, and temporarily resettled over 9,000 disaster victims who had fled the famine in Pingmin, Chaoyi, Dali, Taiyang, and other counties. At the same time, more than 2,500 disaster victims who were willing to stay in Shaanxi for a long time were transferred to the Huanglong Reclamation Area for production and settlement. Currently, most of the disaster victims have, with the help and organization of the local people's government, participated in various sideline productions and canal construction. According to statistics, more than 2,000 people have participated in the construction of the Luo River-Hui River Canal project alone. The prefectural people's government also allocated 100 shi of relief grain, purchased 1,000 carrying poles, 1,000 pairs of bamboo baskets, and 500 iron rakes, and distributed them to the disaster victims working on the canal, solving the problem of tools for canal construction for the disaster victims.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th. Southern Jiangsu is successively sending disaster-stricken compatriots from neighboring areas back to their hometowns for spring plowing. Since last September, more than 70,000 disaster victims from severely affected areas such as northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui have fled to southern Jiangsu. The people's governments at all levels in southern Jiangsu have properly resettled the disaster victims arriving in the area, and have helped them through last year's winter famine and the two-plus months of this year's spring famine by providing work relief through water conservancy construction, social mutual assistance, and introducing them to odd jobs. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, the people's governments in southern Jiangsu have educated the disaster-stricken compatriots from neighboring areas about returning to their hometowns for spring plowing production, and have solved the problem of travel expenses for the disaster victims' return home through fundraising. Benniu Town in Wujin County alone subsidized the disaster victims with more than 30,000 jin of rice; the Zhenjiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also set up a foreign disaster victim repatriation station on the riverbank, hiring special boats to send the disaster victims back to their hometowns for production. As of now, more than 25,000 disaster victims have been repatriated to their hometowns throughout the region.
