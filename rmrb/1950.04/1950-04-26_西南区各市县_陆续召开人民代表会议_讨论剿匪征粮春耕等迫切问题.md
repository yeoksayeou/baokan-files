Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 24th: People's representative conferences from all walks of life are being held successively in municipalities and counties of the Southwest Region. From January to the end of March, people's representative conferences have been held in the following areas: 16 counties including Jiangbei, Wanxian, and Jiangjin in the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region; 17 counties and cities including Neijiang, Luxian, and Zigong in the Southern Sichuan Administrative Region; 8 counties and cities including Guanxian, Mianyang, and Meishan in the Western Sichuan Administrative Region; more than 20 counties including Nanchong and Suining in the Northern Sichuan Administrative Region; more than 20 counties and cities including Zunyi, Bijie, and Anshun in Guizhou Province; and counties in Yunnan Province such as Chuxiong, Xuanwei, and Yuxi. Other regions are also actively preparing to convene conferences from the beginning of April. A small number of counties and cities, such as Luxian and Zigong, have even held their second conferences.

The conferences in various regions have focused on discussing the pressing issues of bandit suppression, grain collection, and spring plowing. Regarding the issue of grain collection, after discussions at the conferences, the representatives generally recognized the need to complete the collection tasks and implement the principle of reasonable burden. The conferences in Neijiang, Luxian, Fushun, and other counties in the Southern Sichuan Region all passed resolutions to quickly complete the grain collection work. Conferences in various regions also passed measures such as reporting concealed landholdings, organizing burden assessment committees to review burdens, simplifying grain collection procedures, and urging landlords to hand over grain. Regarding bandit suppression, the people's representative conferences in various regions decided on specific measures. The conferences in Guizhou Province decided to implement joint defense for bandit suppression and carry out political offensives to disintegrate bandit organizations. After the conference, the peasant masses in Guangyuan County in the Northern Sichuan Region spontaneously organized to assist the government in capturing bandits and reporting hidden spies. Regarding spring plowing, the conferences in various regions have put forward difficulties and solutions for overcoming them. For example, the Luxian people's representative conference in the Southern Sichuan Region proposed organizing production committees composed of farmer representatives to promote spring plowing and called on all farmers in the county to plow and cultivate three times each, and weed the seedlings twice, to ensure that this year's agricultural production level is not reduced due to bandit activities or other difficulties. The conferences in Neijiang, Fushun, and other counties also made guarantees to not leave any land uncultivated. In addition, Zigong City in the Southern Sichuan Region also passed specific plans for gradually restoring the Zi and Gong salt fields, and Nanchong County in the Northern Sichuan Region put forward suggestions for improving the development of sericulture and the cultivation of mulberry seedlings. The representative conferences in Bijie and other counties in Guizhou Province passed resolutions to mobilize the masses to automatically eradicate opium seedlings and report drug trafficking. The people's representative conference in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan Region, promoted the organization of shipbuilding cooperatives, the construction of canals and dams, and the organization of unemployed workers to develop coal mining and other production undertakings.

After the people's representative conferences were held in various regions, the connection between the people and the government was greatly strengthened. Some representatives in various regions who originally held skeptical and wait-and-see attitudes actively put forward many suggestions after seeing the responsible cadres of the People's Government strictly reviewing their work and humbly seeking everyone's opinions at the conference. However, some government cadres in some places do not yet understand the significant role of the people's representative conferences and regard holding such conferences as a burden, and therefore act perfunctorily and take a casual attitude. In some places, the democratic style is not sufficient, and government cadres do not patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, so the conference cannot achieve the expected results.

　　西南区各市县
    陆续召开人民代表会议
    讨论剿匪征粮春耕等迫切问题
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】西南区各市、县正陆续召开各界人民代表会议。从一月到三月底止，已举行各界人民代表会议的计有：川东行政区的江北、万县、江津等十六个县，川南行政区的内江、泸县、自贡等十七个县、市，川西行政区的灌县、绵阳、眉山等八个县、市，川北行政区的南充、遂宁等二十余县，贵州省的遵义、毕节、安顺等二十余县、市，云南省的楚雄、宣威、玉溪等县。其他各地自四月初起亦积极筹备召开。泸县、自贡等少数县、市并已举行了第二次会议。
    各地会议都着重讨论了清剿土匪、征收公粮和春耕生产等项当前的迫切问题。关于征收公粮问题，各地会议经过讨论后，与会代表普遍认识到必须完成征收任务，并实行合理负担原则。川南区内江、泸县、富顺等县的会议，均通过了迅速完成征粮工作的决议。各地会议并通过了检举黑田、组织负担评议会评论负担、简化征粮手续、催促地主交粮等办法。关于清剿土匪方面，各地各界人民代表会议分别决定了具体办法。贵州省各地会议决定实行联防剿匪，并进行政治攻势，瓦解土匪组织。川北区广元县的农民群众，在会后即自动组织起来，协助政府捕捉土匪，检举暗藏的特务。关于进行春耕工作，各地会议都分别提出了春耕中的困难和克服的办法。如川南区泸县各界代表会议提出推派农民代表等组织生产委员会以推动春耕工作，并号召全县农民做到三犁三耕、拔两次苗，不因匪情及其他困难使今年农业生产水平降低。内江、富顺等县的会议也提出了不荒一亩地的保证。此外，川南区自贡市并通过了逐步恢复自、贡两盐场的具体方案，川北区南充县对发展蚕丝生产和培育桑苗，提出了改进意见。贵州省毕节等县代表会议通过了动员群众自动铲除烟苗和检举贩卖毒品的决议。川北区广元县人民代表会议推动发起了组织造船合作社、修渠、筑坝、组织失业工人开采煤矿等生产事业。
    各地召开了各界人民代表会议以后，大大地密切了人民与政府间的联系。各地某些原来抱着怀疑观望态度的代表，在会上看到人民政府负责干部严格地检讨工作和虚心征求大家意见后，都积极地提出了很多建议。但是，有些地方的政府干部还不了解各界人民代表会议的重大作用，认为召开这种会议是一种负担，因此草率从事，采取应付的态度；有的地方民主作风不够，政府干部不耐心倾听群众的意见，使会议不能收到预期的效果。
