    Strictly Prevent Trains from Running Over People!
    Education on Train Safety Should be Conducted Among the Masses; Train Attendants and Others Should Also Pay Attention to This Matter
To the Editor:
    Since the opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, three farmers have been run over and killed by trains in the Linmingguan area alone. I have heard that train accidents causing deaths have also occurred in other places.
    The reasons for these accidents are mostly that farmers lack knowledge of train safety and do not know the dangers of trains. They get on and off without waiting for the train to stop completely. However, some accidents are also due to the carelessness of the crew (such as the death of Li Guizhi, which was caused by the driver exceeding the speed limit when passing through the construction site and not paying attention to the hand signal of the construction site personnel); and poor vehicle equipment and unsound station facilities (such as no electric lights in slow trains, and too short a stopping time at stations).
    I suggest that, on the one hand, local governments near the railway should conduct education among the masses to be careful around trains; on the other hand, the crew and station personnel of the transportation department should also pay attention to this matter, and not simply think that they have done their duty. They should also consider the lack of knowledge of the farmers and always pay attention to whether there is a possibility of accidents near the vehicles. Like one service personnel who patiently dispersed the crowd gathered around the train, when a driver said to him: "You're just asking for scolding!" The service personnel replied: "I would rather be scolded than let something go wrong." Such an attitude is worth learning from.

### 严防火车轧死人！  应向群众进行小心火车的教育  火车乘务员等也应注意这件事

　　严防火车轧死人！
    应向群众进行小心火车的教育   
    火车乘务员等也应注意这件事编辑同志：
    自从京汉路通车以来，光在临洺关这一个地方就被火车轧死了三个农民。别的地方听说也有发生火车轧死人的事情。
    这些事情发生的原因，多半是农民没有乘车常识，不知道火车的厉害，不等到火车站稳，就来回上下；但也有的是因为乘务人员大意疏忽（像李贵只的死是因为司机通过工地时超过了规定的速度，并不注意工地人员的手旗信号所致）；和车辆设备不好，车站机构不健全（像慢车里没有电灯、车站上停车时间过短等）。
    我建议一方面靠近铁道的地方政府应该向群众进行小心火车的教育；另一方面，交通部门的乘务员和车站人员同志们也都应当注意这件事，不要单纯认为尽到自己应尽的责任就算完了；而要顾及农民缺乏常识的现状，经常注意车辆附近有没有发生事故的可能。像有一位服务人员那样：当他耐心地赶散围拢在火车四周的群众时，一位司机向他说：“你得啦吧，净找挨骂！”这位服务员却说：“我宁愿挨骂，也不叫它出岔子。”这样的态度是值得学习的。
