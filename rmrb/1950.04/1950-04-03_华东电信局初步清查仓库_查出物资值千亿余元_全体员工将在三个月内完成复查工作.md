　　East China Telecommunications Bureau's Preliminary Inventory of Warehouse
    Reveals Materials Worth Over 100 Billion Yuan
    All Employees to Complete Re-inspection Within Three Months

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Liberation Daily news on March 26th: Under the correct leadership of the East China Telecommunications Administration, the People's Government, and the Military Control Commission, and through the efforts of all employees for over three months (actual working time), the preliminary inventory of the warehouse was completed on February 10th of this year. More than 1,800 people participated in this work. As of the end of February, approximately 50,721 boxes of equipment had been cleared out, with a preliminary estimated value of over 130 billion RMB.

    Various Materials, All Types Available, Exposed to Sun and Rain, Neglected
    Employees Raise Awareness, Cherish National Property

    Before the inventory, the so-called warehouse left over by the puppet Materials Supply Bureau was actually as chaotic as a garbage dump. Besides a portion being telecommunications equipment, it could be said to have everything imaginable, from women's cosmetics and high heels to various equipment for the army, navy, and air force, as well as factory machines and ordinary household pots, bowls, and ladles. The sources included surplus American military supplies, American aid materials, Canadian loan materials, and Japanese-style materials received from the Japanese. Except for a very small portion placed inside buildings, most were placed in the material yard, exposed to wind, rain, sun, and dew for four or five years. Perfectly good radio vacuum tubes were scattered all over the ground, and the outer casing of large PE-95 motors had rotted through, breaking at the slightest touch. Small batteries, about a thousand boxes of three-six sections each, had rotted into a pile. Thousands of bundles of various electrical wires were tangled like spider webs and soaked in water. The warehouse of the puppet Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was slightly better, but even there, items were not classified, but mixed together and placed in five or six warehouses, with several thousand boxes also placed in the open air. Furthermore, the accounts were also mixed up and unclear. At the beginning of the inventory, many employees expressed a lack of confidence, believing that it was impossible to clean, classify, put into storage, and relocate these materials from the "garbage dump" within a few months. Some technicians, deeply influenced by reactionary education, initially refused to go to the warehouse to do the specific work of inventorying materials, believing that it was work for "inferior people." They created disunity with the workers and lost their temper during work. However, the leadership consistently adopted a patient approach of education and transformation, and the Party member cadres took the lead in enduring hardship in the most difficult work, thus educating the masses. The employees' class consciousness was also raised in the actual work, and they displayed the spirit of cherishing national property. Everyone used their brains, came up with ideas, and overcame difficulties, finally enabling the inventory work to achieve brilliant results.

    Guarantee Accurate Quantity and Clear Quality, Employees Form Re-inspection Committee

    However, due to many shortcomings still existing in the work, such as not strictly enforcing the work system, some inventory groups have not yet been able to truly achieve "accurate quantity" and "clear quality." The main reasons are: (1) Some comrades participating in the work had a simple desire for speed. (2) There was a lack of a conscientious and responsible spirit. During the inventory, when encountering equipment that no one recognized, they would casually pack it into boxes, sometimes recording it in the accounts and sometimes not. (3) The leadership did not do enough to systematically and organizationally educate everyone to check each other, and regarding the accuracy of the numbers, they only verbally asked "Are the numbers accurate?" without checking a few boxes to verify. They simply accepted the response that "The numbers will not be inaccurate." They did not turn the inspection system into a mass-based work. In order to make up for the shortcomings in the work and truly be responsible for the people's property, all employees of the bureau warmly support the State Council's "Decision on the Nationwide Inventory and Allocation of Warehouse Materials" and established the Materials Re-inspection and Sorting Committee on March 22nd to carry out the re-inspection work. The basic principle of the re-inspection is to achieve "accurate quantity and clear quality" and accept past inventory experience, starting with focusing on manpower. The entire re-inspection period is set for three months, and the employees have unanimously proposed to guarantee its completion on schedule.

　　华东电信局初步清查仓库
    查出物资值千亿余元     
    全体员工将在三个月内完成复查工作
    【本报讯】据三月二十六日解放日报消息：华东电信管理局在人民政府和军管会正确领导下，经全体职工三月余的努力（实际工作时间），于本年二月十日初步完成清查仓库任务。参加此次工作的先后有一千八百余人，截至二月底止，已清理出器材约五万零七百二十一箱，据初步估价，值人民币一千三百余亿元。
    各色物资样样全  日晒夜露无人管
    职工提高觉悟  爱护祖国财产
    该局在没有进行清点前，伪物资供应局所遗留下的所谓仓库，实际上乱得像个垃圾堆，除一部分是电信器材外，可以说应有尽有，从女人用的化装品高跟鞋到海陆空军的各种装备，更有工厂的机器和普通家庭用的锅、碗、瓢，来源分美军剩余料、美援料、加拿大贷款料及接收日本人的日式料等。这些东西除极少数是放在房子内，大部分是放在料场，经过四五年的风吹雨打，日晒夜露，完好的无线电真空管抛的满地皆是，大的ＰＥ—９５电机的外壳都烂通了气，轻轻用手一动就坏了，三六小节一包的小电池，约一千多箱都烂成了一团，成千捆的各式电线乱得像蛛网并浸在水中。伪上海电信局的仓库虽比较好一点，但也没有分类，混杂一起，放置在五六个仓库内，有数千箱亦是放在露天下，并且帐册亦混杂不清。在开始清点时有很多职工表示无信心，认为在几个月内要把这些器材从“垃圾堆”中清理分类入库和迁仓是不可能的事。并有部分受反动教育影响极深的技术人员，开始不愿下仓去做这种清点器材的具体工作，认为这是“下等人”干的事，在工作中与工人闹不团结，发脾气，但领导上始终本着教育改造方针耐心予以说服，在最艰苦的工作中，党员干部带头吃苦，就在这样的情况下，教育了群众。职工们的阶级觉悟也在实际工作中得到提高，发挥了爱护国家财产的精神，大家动脑筋，想办法，克服困难，最后终使清点工作获得辉煌的成绩。
    保证数量清质量明  职工再组复查委会
    但由于工作中尚存在着许多缺点，如对工作制度检查不严格，致使有的清查组还没有能真正做到“数量清”“质量明”的程度。其主要原因是：（一）参加工作的部分同志存在着单纯求快的思想。（二）缺乏认真负责的精神，在清查时有时遇到大家都不认识的器材，就马马虎虎装进箱子，有时记账有时不记账。（三）领导上对有计划有组织教育大家互相检查做的不够，对数目准确与否只是口头上问“数目准不准”而没有做到抽几箱来查看一下，只听下面说“数目不会不准确”就算了。没有把检查制度变为群众性的工作。为了弥补工作中的缺点，做到真正对人民财产负责，该局全体职工热烈拥护政务院“关于全国仓库物资清理调配的决定”，已于三月二十二日成立器材复查整理委员会，从事复查工作，复查基本原则是要做到“数量清、质量明”并接受过去清查经验，先依照人力重点进行。全部清查期定三个月，职工们都已一致提出保证如期完成。
