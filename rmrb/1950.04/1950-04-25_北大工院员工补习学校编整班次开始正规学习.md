　　Beida Institute of Technology Employee Supplementary School Begins Regular Classes After Class Reorganization
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Employee Supplementary School of the Peking University Institute of Technology has begun regularized study. Last month, the school held a class placement test, dividing students into five elementary school classes and one middle school class based on their Chinese language proficiency, and four elementary school classes and one middle school class based on their arithmetic proficiency. The teaching staff has also been strengthened, with two students, two teaching assistants, and ten staff members from the Peking University Institute of Technology teaching. Teachers of each subject have also formed teaching groups, establishing a regular meeting system to study, plan, and improve teaching. The students' enthusiasm for learning is even more active than before. The Employee Supplementary School of the Peking University Institute of Technology was established in November of last year, with 115 students, mostly workers from the institute's practice factory, dormitory, and classrooms. After four months of study, low-grade students have learned an average of more than 400 characters each; middle-grade students have learned to write compositions and letters, and high-grade students have learned elementary mathematics. At the same time, the political consciousness of the workers has also been raised. For example, after studying, technicians Pan Xinyuan, Liu Xudong, and Guo Baolin returned more than 30 pieces of school factory tools that had been taken away before liberation. Liu Daguan, the worker who watches the classrooms, collected the chalk left behind by professors during lectures, accumulated a large box, and handed it over to the general affairs section, saving the school's expenses.

　　北大工院员工补习学校编整班次开始正规学习
    【本报讯】北京大学工学院员工补习学校已开始正规化的学习。该校于上月份举行了编班测验，将学员按国文程度分为小学五班、中学一班，按算术程度分为小学四班、中学一班上课。教师陈容亦已加强，由北大工学院同学二人、助教二人和职员十人任课。各课教员并组成了教学小组，订出了定期的会议制度，以研究、计划和改进教学。学员们的学习情绪较以前更积极了。按北大工学院员工补习学校成立于去年十一月，有学员一百一十五人，多是该院实习工厂、宿舍和教室的工友。经过四个月来的学习，低年级学员平均每人认识了四百多个字；中年级的学会了作文和写信，高年级的学会了初等数学。同时，也提高了工友的政治觉悟。如技工潘鑫元、刘绪东、郭宝林等学习之后，把解放前拿走的学校工厂的工具三十多件全部送还。看教室的工友刘大贯，把教授讲课时遗留下的粉笔收集，积了一大箱送交事务课，节省了学校的开支。（北工通讯组）
