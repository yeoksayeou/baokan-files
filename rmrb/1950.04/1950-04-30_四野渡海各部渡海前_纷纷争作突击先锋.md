Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 27th. After three months of intensive training for the cross-sea operation, soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army were overjoyed when the order came down assigning them the task of being the vanguard in the cross-sea operation. Each squad, platoon, and company eagerly competed for the pioneer assault mission. The soldiers and officers of the three heroic companies, "Tiger Sharp Knife," "Total Victory," and "Tuanshanzi," led by Liu Meicun, a political instructor of a certain battalion, representative of the Fourth Field Army Political Consultative Conference, and a combat hero, stood under the glorious banners won in previous battles and swore: "We will plant the banner of victory all over Hainan Island!" Communist Party members handed in their allowances, Party membership cards, and cherished possessions, expressing their determination to the CCP committees of the company and battalion, saying: "If we sacrifice ourselves, let these things be our permanent Party dues." Before departure, the battalion received over 9.9 million yuan in permanent Party dues from Communist Party member soldiers and pre-paid Party dues from soldiers striving to join the Party at the front.

Originally, two squads of the Second Platoon of the Third Company of a certain regiment had earned the title of "Hero." Platoon leader Zhang Xiu challenged the entire regiment to strive for the title of "Hero Platoon" in the cross-sea operation. The Second Company, which had received the title "Adding Merit Upon Merit," also expressed its determination to strive for new glory. The Sixth Squad of this company, with twelve members who had performed great meritorious service, including three heroes wearing sparkling medals, all eleven Party members in the squad had expressed their determination to strive to be exemplary Party members in the cross-sea battle. This squad initially accepted the assault mission at the company headquarters, but it was later changed. The soldiers of the entire squad were extremely unwilling and requested a change all the way from the company headquarters to the battalion headquarters. At the company's general meeting of soldiers, the Sixth Squad soldiers said to the political instructor: "Can you find any shortcomings in our squad? If you can't, the assault mission should still be given to us!"

The situation in another battalion was the same. Originally, at the military skills competition, the companies argued fiercely to be selected for the assault, their faces flushed. The battalion leaders were unable to resolve the issue, so they asked each company to compare conditions and let everyone discuss it openly. As a result, the Fourth Company won. Their winning conditions were: the oars and paddles on the boats were prepared most properly, the cadres had more knowledge of navigation, and the most soldiers knew how to swim. One squad leader could stay in the deep sea for two hours. This squad leader immediately expressed his determination, saying: "If necessary, I will definitely drill into the enemy's warship to blow it up and die together with the enemy!"

The boatmen's morale was also extremely high. At the company gate, some boatmen shouted, "We don't want money, we want medals!" "I should be the one to pilot the first boat!" The boatmen who victoriously returned on March 5th after successfully sending the vanguard battalion across the sea enthusiastically described the scene of the Hainan people warmly welcoming the army. They also requested to send the army across the sea again. As a result, everyone's morale was even higher.

### 四野渡海各部渡海前  纷纷争作突击先锋

　　四野渡海各部渡海前
    纷纷争作突击先锋
    【新华社海南前线二十七日电】勤练了三个月渡海作战的人民解放军第四野战军某部，当渡海作战担任先锋任务的命令传达下来时，指战员们欢欣若狂，各班、排、连热烈争着要先锋突击任务。某营教导员、四野政协代表、战斗英雄刘梅村领导下的“猛虎尖刀”、“全胜”、“团山子”三个英雄连的指战员们，站在从历次战斗中得来的光荣旗帜下宣誓：“要把胜利的旗帜插遍海南岛！”共产党员们纷纷交出自己的津贴、党证和心爱的物品，向连、营中共党委表达决心说：“如果牺牲了，就把这些东西作为永久的党费。”某营在出发前，收到共产党员战士们缴纳的永久党费和争取火线入党的战士们预缴的党费达九百九十多万元。
    某团三连二排原已有两个班荣获“英雄”称号，排长张秀向全团挑战，要在渡海作战中争取“英雄排”的称号。得到“功上加功”称号的二连也不示弱，立即也表达了争取新的光荣的决心。他们这个连的第六班，有十二个人曾立大功，其中有三位功臣胸前配着亮晶晶的奖章，班里的十一位党员都已表示了在渡海战中争取做模范党员的决心。这个班，先在连部接受了突击任务，后来又变动了，全班战士极不愿意，从连部一直要求到营部。在全连军人大会上，六班战士们向指导员说：“你能找出我们班的缺点吗？如果找不出来，突击任务还是该交给我们！”
    另一个营的情形也一样，原在比武会上，各连为争取担任突击，争辩得面红耳赤，营的领导干部无法解决，就请各连比条件，自报公议。结果四连获胜，他们获得胜利的条件是：船只上橹、桨准备得最妥善、干部航海知识较丰富、战士们会水的最多，有个班长可以在深海中活动两小时，这位班长当场表决心说：“只要有必要，我一定钻到敌人军舰下去爆破它，和敌人同归于尽！”
    船工们的情绪也极高涨。在连部门口，一些船工们嚷着：“不要钱，要奖章！”“第一船该我来开！”三月五日送先锋营潜渡成功后胜利归来的船工们，兴奋地描述海南人民热烈欢迎大军的情景，他们还要求再送大军过海。因而大家情绪更为高涨。
