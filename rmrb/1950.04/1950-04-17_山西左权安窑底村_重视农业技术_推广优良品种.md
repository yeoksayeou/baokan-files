　　Shanxi Zuoquan Anyao Village
　　Emphasizing Agricultural Technology, Promoting Superior Varieties

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Anyao Village (an administrative village of over 200 households) in the fourth district of Zuoquan, Shanxi, has consistently demonstrated a strong understanding of organizing mutual aid and using warm water to soak seeds. On a democratic basis, they elected five experienced farmers with agricultural skills to serve as technology committee members. They also appointed the village chief, Party branch secretary, labor hero, and production director, totaling nine people, to form the technology committee. They used a scientific perspective to analyze past techniques, distinguishing between those that were incorrect and those that were correct.
                      (Agricultural Assistant Yao Weizhong and Jia Xianting, Fourth District of Zuoquan)

　　山西左权安窑底村
　　重视农业技术  推广优良品种
    【本报讯】山西左权四区安窑底村（二百多户的行政村），在历年来，对组织互助、温汤浸种，较有认识。他们在民主基础上选出有农业技术的五个老农任技术委员，又聘请村长、支书、劳动英雄、生产主任共九人组成了技术委员会。他们运用科学眼光去分析过去技术，那些是错的，那些是对的。
