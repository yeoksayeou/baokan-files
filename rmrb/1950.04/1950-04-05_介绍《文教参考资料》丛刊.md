　　Introducing the "Reference Materials for Culture and Education" Series
　　Yi Jin

　　The "Reference Materials for Culture and Education" series, compiled and printed by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council for cultural and educational workers nationwide, has published two collections, distributed by the Sanlian Bookstore.

　　The main purpose of this publication is "to do cultural and educational work better and avoid many detours, it is necessary to accept foreign experience well, especially the experience of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and to exchange domestic experiences with each other for reference. Its main content is to introduce the cultural and educational policies, regulations, and plans of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the experience of domestic and foreign cultural and educational construction, model cultural and educational workers, as well as reviews of cultural and educational books and newspapers, and indexes of related cultural and educational readings and papers."

　　Judging from the first and second collections, the characteristics of this publication are:

　　1. Each collection not only takes into account a wide range of existing problems, but also focuses on practical issues that urgently need to be resolved and deepened. For example, the first collection focuses on "Workers' and Peasants' Youth Schools," systematically introducing important Soviet resolutions, regulations, and plans in this area. The second collection focuses on "Ideological and Political Education for Students in Elementary, Middle, and Higher Education," specifically introducing the changes in the teaching of Marxism-Leninism in Soviet universities and various regulations, and also selecting two domestic instructions and experiences in ideological and political education. In addition, these two collections introduce many experiences on how to carry out rural art activities, how to conduct teaching, how to organize science education, how to do a good job in publishing, about library work, as well as promoting rural drama troupes and making new slide shows, etc. In particular, "The Process and Gains of Reforming Folk Art and Local Opera" in the second collection is a very good summary of experience.

　　2. This publication not only introduces the achievements of Soviet construction, but more importantly, systematically introduces the specific process, methods, and practical experience of how the Soviet Union achieved these achievements, so that the construction experience of the Soviet Union over the past 30 years can be truly combined with the actual situation of the new China's construction.

　　介绍《文教参考资料》丛刊
    依今
    政务院文化教育委员会为全国文教工作者编印的《文教参考资料》丛刊，已经出版了两辑。由三联书店总经售。
    这个刊物的主要目的是，“为了把文教工作做得更好，避免走许多弯路，必须很好的接受外国的经验，特别是苏联与新民主主义国家的经验，并使国内各地的经验互相交流，用作借鉴。它的主要内容是介绍苏联和新民主主义国家的文教政策、法规及计划方案，国内外文教建设经验，模范文教工作者，以及文教书报的评介和有关文教的读物和论文索引等。”
    就第一、二两辑看来，这刊物的特点是：
    一、每辑内容既能照顾到相当广泛存在的问题，同时也有中心、有重点的提出当前迫切需要解决、需要加深认识的实际问题。例如第一辑里是以“工农青年学校”为中心的，系统的介绍了苏联在这方面的重要决议、法规和计划；第二辑是以“大中小学学生的思想政治教育问题”做中心，除具体介绍了苏联大学中马列主义讲授的变迁过程和各项规定外，并选载了两篇国内思想政治教育的指示和经验的材料。此外，在这两辑里，对于怎样进行农村艺术活动，怎样进行教学，怎样组织科学教育，怎样作好出版工作，关于图书馆工作，以及推动农村剧团、制作新幻灯等等，都介绍了许多经验。特别是第二辑中的“改革民间艺术和地方戏的经过与收获”，是一篇很好的经验总结。
    二、本刊不但介绍了苏联建设的成果，更重要的，是对于苏联如何达到这种成果的具体过程，采取的方法和实际的经验作了系统的介绍，使三十多年来苏联的建设经验能够真正和新中国建设的实际结合起来。
