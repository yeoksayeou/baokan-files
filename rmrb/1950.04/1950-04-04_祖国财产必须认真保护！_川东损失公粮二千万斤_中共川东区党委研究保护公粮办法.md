　　The Property of the Motherland Must Be Carefully Protected!
    Eastern Sichuan Loses 20 Million Jin of Public Grain
    The CCP Eastern Sichuan District Committee Studies Methods for Protecting Public Grain

    [This newspaper dispatch] Chongqing Xinhua Daily News, Eastern Sichuan, reports: In many areas of Eastern Sichuan, serious losses of public grain have occurred due to bandit looting and sabotage, the failure of individual local leading cadres to conduct timely inspections, and the carelessness of warehouse keepers. Statistics show that throughout Eastern Sichuan, over 20 million jin of public grain have been stolen or damaged for the above reasons; in the Bishan sub-district alone, the amount reached over 10 million jin. The CCP Eastern Sichuan District Committee convened an enlarged meeting to study methods for protecting public grain in the future. In addition to self-criticism, the meeting unanimously agreed that protecting grain has become one of the major tasks of government workers and bandit suppression troops at all levels in various regions. In particular, Communist Party members should be more vigilant to prevent bandit and special agent looting and sabotage. Specific measures should include accelerating transportation and strengthening bandit suppression. In general, it is necessary to mobilize and organize active elements among the peasants to provide protection, establish grain protection committees and grain protection groups, strengthen sentry duty, guarding, and information liaison work, and strictly prevent looting, fire, and spoilage. In areas with a relatively sound foundation, strict control and surveillance of bad elements should be further strengthened. Secondly, the construction of granaries should be strengthened; custodians should regularly inspect whether granaries and grains show signs of mildew or spoilage. The government should punish those who neglect their duties according to the severity of the circumstances and commend and reward those who have made meritorious contributions. Chongqing Xinhua Daily News also published a commentary on this major loss of public grain, pointing out that the cause of this loss, whatever the reason, is a problem that deserves serious attention.

　　祖国财产必须认真保护！
    川东损失公粮二千万斤
    中共川东区党委研究保护公粮办法
    【本报讯】据重庆新华日报川东消息：川东不少地区，由于土匪抢劫、破坏及个别地方领导干部未能及时检查，以及保管仓库人员的不慎，致发生公粮严重损失现象，据统计全川东因上述原因被偷盗、损坏的公粮数达二千万斤以上；仅璧山分区即达一千余万斤。中共川东区党委为此曾召开扩大会议，研究今后保护公粮办法。会议对此除进行检讨外，一致认为：保护粮食已成为目前各地各级政府工作人员及剿匪部队的重大任务之一，特别是共产党员应提高警惕，防止匪特抢劫破坏。其具体做法，除加紧运送与加强剿匪外，一般应发动与组织农民中的积极分子保护，建立护粮委员会及护粮小组，加强放哨、守卫和情报连络工作，严防抢劫、失火、霉烂；工作较有基础地区更应严格控制与监视坏分子活动。其次是加强粮仓的建设工作；看管人员应经常进行检查粮仓与粮食是否有霉坏情形。对失职人员，政府应按情节轻重予以处分，有功者表扬与奖励。重庆新华日报对此公粮重大损失事件亦曾发表评论，指出这种损失的造成，无论来自那方面的原因。均是值得引起严重注意的问题。
