　　Cultural and Educational Briefs

　　The East China Office and the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have been established successively. Li Yanong, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, on behalf of the Academy, has taken over the former Academia Sinica's research institutes in Shanghai and Nanjing, including those for chemistry, zoology, botany, engineering, medicine, pharmacy, meteorology, geology, astronomy, physics, and social sciences, as well as the former Peiping Research Institute's crystallography research laboratory, and the drug and physiology research institutes in Shanghai, and the Institute of Geography of China.

　　The Instrument Manufacturing Plant of the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government was established in Nanjing on April 1st. The Bureau has also taken over the former China Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Institute in Nanjing.

　　Under the guidance of the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the East China People's Pharmaceutical Company has successfully researched and produced its own penicillin lead salt. In the past, the raw materials used for penicillin were all potassium salts, which were made into oral tablets. After taking them, the efficacy was reduced due to the action of gastric acid. Lead salt has a strong resistance to gastric acid and is suitable for oral administration. Currently, about 60 percent of the penicillin lead salt raw material cultivated by the company can be used for injections, and the rest is used for oral tablets.

　　The Beijing Botanical Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is actively preparing to compile the "Flora of Hebei," which is planned to be completed within two years.

　　The East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe was established on April 12th. The main task of the troupe is to reform Yue Opera in order to create scientific and popular Jiangnan song and dance drama. Yuan Xuefen, the head of the troupe, announced at the founding meeting that the important work of the troupe this year is to participate in the land reform work in Jiangnan.

　　The first phase of preparatory studies at the East China Military and Political University concluded on the 4th, with more than 10,000 students transferred to the university's undergraduate program and the navy, air force, or other specialized courses for further study.

　　The first cohort of more than 2,000 students from the Fujian People's Revolutionary University graduated on the 4th and have been assigned to work.
