Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th. Southwest Military Region troops are enthusiastically engaged in agricultural production and water conservancy construction. The achievements in water conservancy construction in Western Sichuan are particularly significant.

　　The Chongqing Garrison troops, in the gaps between their heavy garrison duties, are reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables. By mid-March, the unit had reclaimed 457 mu of wasteland and had begun to eat the vegetables they grew themselves.

　　Soldiers from various units of the Guizhou Military Region have written to their leaders pledging to complete production tasks. Commanders and fighters enthusiastically put forward the slogan "Seize the time to work, seize the time to produce, seize the time to study." Chen Huanxin, a soldier from a certain unit, wrote a "Three-Character Classic" for production during production: "For the people, produce, diligent labor, is the truth, need to eat, need to wear, many troops, heavy burden, overcome difficulties, rely on ourselves." This was widely welcomed by the soldiers.

　　Units of the Yunnan Military Region have universally established production teams, utilizing the gaps in bandit suppression to carry out production and wasteland reclamation. The troops in Southern and Western Yunnan are committed to making the motherland's remote border areas blossom and bear fruit. A directly subordinate team of a certain division stationed in Southern Yunnan plans to reclaim 1,000 mu of wasteland this year, and each regiment plans to reclaim 1,500 mu. After arriving in Western Yunnan after a thousand-mile march, a certain unit immediately put forward a production and conservation plan, and various units enthusiastically launched a production competition. The Kunming Garrison troops began reclaiming wasteland at the beginning of this month and have already reclaimed 500 mu. While reclaiming wasteland, commanders and fighters published various forms of newspapers such as the "Wasteland Reclamation Hero News," "Production News," "Labor News," and "Wasteland Reclamation Model News" to commend production heroes, report production achievements, and exchange experiences. They also carried out cultural studies, and their morale was extremely high.

　　The renovation project of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Guanxian County, Western Sichuan, which can irrigate 3.5 million mu of land, was completed and opened for water on the 2nd of this month after active renovation by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. The renovation cost was three-fifths lower than last year, and the entire renovation time was only 95 days, 55 days shorter than last year. Although work started two months later than in the past, it was still able to release water before the Qingming Festival, without delaying the agricultural season. Other projects, such as the Jiudao Weir in Mianyang County, which can irrigate 55,000 mu of land, the Honghua Weir in Qingshen County, which can irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land, and the canals in counties such as Zhuxi and Jintang, have all been completed under the active repair of the stationed troops. The dredging projects of the city moat rivers in Chengdu, Mianyang, Wenjiang and other counties have also been completed successively. In mid-March, the troops in the Qionglai urban area completed the renovation of a 5-li long canal in three days and repaired several large canals outside the city, enabling the timely irrigation of more than 200,000 mu of paddy fields in Qionglai County; the farmers only paid for a small amount of necessary equipment, which was three-quarters less than the cost in previous years.

　　保证祖国荒僻边地开花结果
    西南部队热烈进行生产
    可灌地三百五十万亩的都江堰修整完工
    【新华社重庆二十七日电】西南军区各部队正在热烈地进行农业生产和水利建设。川西地区的水利建设成绩尤为显著。
    重庆市警备部队在繁重警备任务的空隙中，进行垦荒种菜。迄三月中旬，该部已开荒四百五十七亩，并已开始食用自己种的菜蔬。
    贵州军区各部战士纷纷上书首长保证完成生产任务。指战员们热烈提出“抓紧时间工作，抓紧时间生产，抓紧时间学习”的口号。某部战士陈焕新在生产中写了一段生产三字经说：“为人民，来生产，勤劳动，是真理，要吃饭，要穿衣，部队多，负担重，克困难，靠自己。”受到战士们普遍的欢迎。。
    云南军区部队已普遍成立生产小组，利用剿匪空隙展开生产开荒。滇南、滇西的部队保证要使祖国荒僻的边地上开花结果。滇南驻军某师直属队计划今年开荒一千亩，各团均计划开荒一千五百亩。某部刚经千里进军抵达滇西后，立即提出生产节约的计划，各单位热烈展开生产竞赛。昆明市警备部队自本月初开始开荒，已开荒五百亩。各部指战员们在开荒中，出版了《开荒英雄报》、《生产报》、《劳动报》、《开荒模范报》等各种形式的报纸，表扬生产英雄，报告生产成绩和交流经验，同时也进行了文化学习，情绪极为高涨。
    川西可灌地三百五十万亩的灌县都江堰整修工程，经解放军某部积极整修后，已于本月二日完工放水。整修费较去年节省五分之三，全部整修时间只有九十五天，较去年缩短五十五天，开工虽较以往迟两个月，但仍能于清明节前放水，未误农时。其他如可灌地五万五千亩的绵阳县九道堰、可灌地二万余亩的青神县鸿化堰和县竹、金堂等县水渠，均在驻军积极抢修下完成整修工作。成都、绵阳、温江等县的城周河道的修浚工程也先后完工。邛崃城区部队在三月中旬的三天中完成长达五里的水渠修整工程，并将城外的几条大水渠修理完毕，使邛崃县二十余万亩水田获得及时的灌溉；而农民仅出少数必须购买的器材费用，较往年的费用减少四分之三。
