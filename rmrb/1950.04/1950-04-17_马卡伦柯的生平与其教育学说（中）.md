　　"Only in the collective can the individual obtain the means that enable the all-round development of his qualities...," Makarenko, starting from this Marxist proposition, announced a new educational logic, according to which education should proceed from the collective to the individual personalities.

　　Makarenko only called the social unity based on the principle of socialist solidarity a collective. The socialist nature of solidarity is primarily determined by all its advanced and progressive purposes. In the collective organization of people, the idea of ​​class struggle for the liberation of mankind from the shackles of exploitation is manifested. The collective, as a socialist type of organization, is based on the conscious and voluntary unity of the workers.

　　Standing on this position, Makarenko made a devastating criticism of the biological tendency in the concept of the collective. In educational works, the following definition was particularly popular: "The so-called collective is a group of people who interact with each other and have a common response to external stimuli." Makarenko often proved to his enemies that interaction and response are not signs of society, but signs of biology.

　　Makarenko said that children's collective is a phenomenon of Soviet social life.

　　Misunderstood "logic" regards education as a process of "paired influence" of teachers on students, regardless of the social conditions of education. The new logic, the logic of Soviet pedagogy, does not exclude this paired education system, if in this case the teacher is acting on behalf of the collective and for the benefit of the collective.

　　Under collective education, the leadership and organizational role of educators is incomparably higher than in the paired education system. Teachers must carefully observe the collective life of children and make firm opinions on everything that happens in the collective. Teachers should be good at giving correct advice to the children's collective organs on how to act in a certain occasion based on the formed opinions. Here, teachers should be particularly tactful in order to preserve the illusion of children's independence in solving problems of collective life. The teacher must be a person with a strong will. The teacher's will should become the will of the entire collective. Opinion, advice, tact and will, according to Makarenko, are the basic guidelines that regulate the path of educational leadership for children's collectives.

　　According to Makarenko, the primary collective is "the main method of contacting personality." Teachers must always pay attention to the individual quality education of individual personalities, but for this, teachers must first cultivate each student's sense of responsibility for their classmates' collective. These new educational relations are constrained by the necessity of organizing children's lives with collective principles, and this relationship has become Makarenko's argument for studying the so-called parallel action pedagogy.

　　The essence of parallel action pedagogy lies in the fact that the influence on the primary collective is to abide by a certain educational tact, due to which individual personalities feel that they are not the object of education, but participants in the collective life of labor. Makarenko said: "We do not deal with personality. The formal formula is this. In essence, this is exactly the form that affects personality, but the formula is parallel to the substance."

　　The idea of ​​parallel action logic proposed by Makarenko is the most complete form of educational organization of the social factors that influence the formation of individual characteristics of personality in the collective.

　　Children's collective has a unique characteristic that distinguishes it from adult collectives. This is the game nature of children's activities, the purpose of which is to achieve important tasks with social significance.

　　In Makarenko's educational practice, the so-called "militarization" was the form of children's collective games. The collective formation is divided into teams, each team is equipped with a captain, parade marches, with flags, drums and orchestras, commands, salutes, horns, reports, and guards to protect property and order. This is the main component of a game that fills children's collective life.

　　The main condition for the movement and development of the collective is the connection with larger collectives. Makarenko had guided his students from the life of the labor colony to the life of the entire Soviet Union, unfolding before his students a bright path of future joy. He keenly listened to the pulse of the children's collective, experiencing the slowness or stagnation of growth heavily, and quickly promoted the collective by restoring or expanding the path of development prospects. Makarenko firmly believed: "...The interests of the large collective do not come from simple communication, but from a deeper social synthesis. Only through such a large collective can we enter into broad political education."

　　Makarenko cultivated the noblest characteristic of collective members—the ability to subordinate their own interests to the interests of society—through the method of expanding collective boundaries. Makarenko believed that separating the individual path from social tasks was a manifestation of concentrated philistine habits. He taught his students to evaluate themselves from the perspective of the social importance of people.

　　In connection with the question of the significance of broad political prospects for children's communist education, Makarenko pointed out that the "isolation" of individual collectives and the abandonment of major social tasks are not allowed. Only when the collective embarks on the road of social and political life can it be considered a collective.

　　When examining the issues of the organization of children's collective labor life, Makarenko gave a series of extremely important and valuable ideas about discipline in the collective. First of all, we should point out the point of divergence between Makarenko and several pedagogical theorists on a basic issue: what is conscious discipline? The representatives of the intellectual school in pedagogy (they deny the role and significance of training in discipline education) affirmed that discipline comes from the pure consciousness of children and is not influenced by adults. Therefore, it is called conscious discipline, or more correctly, "self-discipline" or "self-organization." Contrary to this idealistic view, Makarenko put forward a proposition that is correct from the point of view of dialectical materialism: conscious discipline means understanding the necessity, usefulness, obligation, and class significance of discipline. According to his opinion, discipline is not only generated from pure intellectual conviction, not only from thought, but also from social experience, from practical comradeship and collective action.

　　Makarenko regarded discipline in our society as a political and moral phenomenon. Therefore, his students regarded discipline as "a natural and necessary state of every collective."

　　Makarenko's educational thought on discipline in the collective is his creative absorption of Lenin and Stalin's achievements on the daily, labor, conscious, free and iron discipline in socialist society.

　　An important condition of Makarenko's collective education is the accumulation of traditions—rules and habits—in the children's collective. Everyone accepts these rules and habits not with "pure consciousness," but with conscious respect for the experience of the older generation and conscious respect for the great authority of the entire collective.

　　On the basis of tradition, the style and sentiment in the collective are gradually cultivated. It changed from an impulsive, arrogant, noisy, painful, drooping, and pessimistic style to a healthy, tonal style, which is unique to the Makarenko collective. Makarenko believed that style and sentiment, as well as the issue of the collective core, are the most important parts of pedagogy.

　　Not only should teachers care about discipline in the collective, but discipline should also become a tradition of the collective.

　　Makarenko unites children into a collective based on their conscious attitude towards the assigned tasks, and he also uses the emotional effects on children to supplement the collective education system. The purpose of this effect is to cultivate a sense of honor, pride, and responsibility, and its content is revolutionary romanticism.

　　The collective is a certain individual world for Makarenko. He revealed the characteristics of children's nature that have not been damaged by selfishness very thoroughly, and he also revealed the deviations from the moral face of the ideal. Makarenko perfected the character of children by organizing various methods of approaching and cooperating with personalities. Therefore, when organizing primary collectives, he adopted the principle of mixed grouping. This principle is vividly described in the following words: "The students of the Gorky Labor Colony are also distinguished with such careful attention: the strong and the weak, the energetic and the helpless, the strict and the happy, the real people and the selfish people—all of these found their place according to different considerations."

　　Under the conditions of common labor of students of the labor colony and members of the commune, Makarenko cultivated their mutual friendship and comradeship. This friendship and comradeship is based on mutual respect, mutual help, mutual protection and mutual correction of mistakes.

　　Makarenko believed that stealing in the collective is a particularly destructive factor of comradeship. He once said: "Stealing in a close collective... destroys the sentiment of common happiness, destroys the trust between comrades, and introduces suspicion, the most disgusting instinct to care about private property, and cautious and disguised selfishness into life. If the thief is not exposed, then the collective will immediately split into several directions: whispers occur in the dormitory, and the names of suspicious people are shouted in secret talks. Dozens of characters are subjected to the heaviest test, and it is precisely the character that is willing to maintain and is extremely difficult to reconcile... Stealing belongs to those frequent phenomena in the collective. In these phenomena, there is no subject of influence, and the chemical reaction is more harmful than the will."

　　A·C·Makarenko created an accurate and organized structure of children's collectives, dividing them into primary collectives. These primary collectives can be equipped according to the principles of school, production or age depending on the situation. The leaders of the primary collectives are closely united with the strong youth league organizations. They are not appointed, but elected at the general meeting after the team proposes candidates. All the leaders of the primary collectives form the council of the collective—the central organ of the children's collective. This central organ handles all the daily work in the collective. The general meeting is the main organ of autonomy, and its prestige should be firmly supported by all the forces of the children's education organ.

　　Under the correct educational influence, the decisions of the collective council and the student general meeting not only do not destroy the one-leader system of the children's education organ, but on the contrary, consolidate it. The administrative authorities, on the one hand, seem to be revealing decisions to the collective council, and on the other hand, they are quoting these decisions to strengthen their own measures.

　　Parallel to the primary collectives, according to needs, several small temporary mixed groups can be organized from the representatives of the primary collectives to complete certain labor tasks. The commanders of the teams can be ordinary members of these mixed groups, and the ordinary members of the primary teams can be the commanders of these mixed groups. The purpose of organizing mixed groups is: on the one hand, to prevent the formation of a "leadership class," and on the other hand, to cultivate new leading cadres and train ordinary students in organizational functions.

　　The democratic principles of children's collective organization realized in Makarenko's experience have promoted the cultivation of children's political awareness, organization, responsibility, and automatic spirit, which are all necessary for the successful completion of learning tasks and production tasks.

　　A·C·Makarenko extended his general theory of collective education to children's education under the conditions of family collectives.

　　Families with many children and consolidation are not afraid of the "physical collapse" caused by the small number of people, nor are they afraid of the "chemical decomposition" caused by the abnormal relationship between parents that leads to divorce. Only under the conditions of such families is it possible to correctly organize children's communist education.

　　A·C·Makarenko's theory on children's collectives as factors of communist education, as well as the theory of children's collective education related to it, have enriched Soviet pedagogy with new propositions that have shaken off the influence of bourgeois pedagogical theory, thereby opening up broad possibilities for their application to practice.

　　(V)

　　Makarenko usually considers the issue of communist moral education not in terms of its constituent parts, but as a whole. This is due to two reasons:

　　First, Makarenko firmly believes that a person is cultivated comprehensively in the process of his own activities. Therefore, what educators should deal with is not some individual tasks in communist moral education, but all tasks. These tasks are realized simultaneously in the specific forms of children's activities—in learning, in productive labor, in games, in artistic creation, and in social work.

　　Lenin said at the Third Congress of the Youth League: "The Communist Youth League should educate everyone in conscious and disciplined labor, from youth, from the age of twelve." Makarenko studied a series of propositions in accordance with Lenin's instructions. In his lecture on "Labor Education" (he called it that not by accident), Makarenko included many basic issues of communist moral education—Soviet patriotism education, socialist attitudes towards labor, towards public property, and towards the collective—in the labor process.

　　Second, Makarenko's concern for the moral face of the Soviet people is not only as an educator, but also as a writer who summarizes the extensive phenomena of Soviet social life with artistic images. Therefore, the issue of the formation of communist personality occupies a central position among the other issues of communist moral education that he studied. Because of this, as we have already said above, Makarenko added many new ideas to the theory of psychological characteristics of personality.

　　In his works, Makarenko brilliantly explained the class history of morality. Lenin had an instruction: "Clergy, landlords, and the bourgeoisie preach in the name of a false God in order to implement their own interests as exploiters." Based on this instruction, Makarenko made a ruthless criticism of the religious ethical system.

　　"The necessity of these ethical systems is to enable class oppression and universal and irresistible exploitation to exist with 'sacred conscience' and the greatest success."

　　Bourgeois morality is derived from the will of God, and its main characteristics are extreme individualism and pessimism. "After people have lost all hope of any substitute for free life, they have decided to engage in the suicidal enterprise of finding this freedom in pessimistic individualism..."

　　The characteristics of communist morality are collectivism and optimism. This collectivism and optimism are generated in the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people who are building communism. A famous quote from Lenin says: "Morality is what is used to destroy the old exploitative society and unite all the working masses around the proletariat to create a new communist society." Makarenko quoted these words and derived a general standard for evaluating the behavior of Soviet people: "Our behavior should only be measured by the interests of the collective and its members."

　　Makarenko put forward two of the most important tasks, which are in dialectical unity:

　　The first task is to create a system of communist ethics that can be realized in practice according to the theory of Lenin and Stalin. This system should abandon all moral codes that have existed in history. This system should combine the philosophical study of the problem with the explanation of the ethical and moral traditions of our society. All the work in this area should be subordinate to practical purposes.

　　The second task is to oppose the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. Bourgeois ethics are full of vitality not only as a moral habit, but also as a moral logic.

　　When further studying this issue directly, Makarenko pointed out the necessity of critically analyzing the old moral concepts and representations.

　　First of all, it is necessary to distinguish between the substance of different moral concepts and the names that have the same name. Makarenko said: "The integrity of a 'honest person' means: 'I don't want other people's things', 'I don't want extra things', 'I don't want unjust things'." "Our integrity should be an active requirement for ourselves and for others: I want, and require of myself and others, to pay full attention to public interests, full working hours, full ability for my own business, full development of strength, full knowledge, I want, and require, the most perfect and correct action."

　　In parallel with this, a question arises about filling the names of old moral concepts with new content. For example, jealousy, which expresses a hateful emotion of private owners, and on the other hand, "How can one love without jealousy, how can one love without being jealous." Some questions of this kind, without a doubt, need to be answered, and they should not be overlooked by us.

　　Finally, some new concepts must be added to our moral code. "For example, in a communist society, the ability to be accurate and punctual, to express clearly, to demand clearly, and to answer clearly should be examined not only from a business point of view, but also from an ethical point of view."

　　All of Makarenko's ideas on communist morality are directed towards cultivating inspiring Soviet patriotism and cultivating socialist attitudes towards labor, public property, and the collective.

　　When talking about patriotic education, Makarenko attached great importance to revolutionary vigilance. He pointed out such phenomena as conditional "communism," which is expressed in verbal disguise and behavioral mimicry: "In recent years, we have had the opportunity to firmly believe that some people who particularly eloquently preach their own revolution have become hidden enemies of the revolution." Or: "External action is also a conditional sign of true essence to some extent." Makarenko's call to eliminate the conditionality and symbolism of external signs of behavior in human's true character.

　　Makarenko said that labor in our country is not only an economic category, but also a moral category. Comrade Stalin taught us that labor in our country has changed from a dishonorable burden to an honorable, brave, and heroic undertaking. Therefore, Makarenko concluded that begging, which is defended by Christian ethics, is a sign of moral depravity here. Makarenko was the first to examine the moral standard of a Soviet person in the plan of making conscious and highly productive labor as a basic sign of his socialist character.

　　Makarenko's ideas on the attitude towards public property are extremely profound. When talking about the basic principle of communism: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," Makarenko pointed out that this principle is incomprehensible to individualists who covet everything. Individualists believe that in the communist era, everyone will attack public wealth. Makarenko proudly pointed out: "Even now, there are many people in our country who can live according to this formula without seizing or taking anything home."

　　In our society, socialist relations are expressed in the mutual respect of Soviet people. In bourgeois society, the scope of one person's wishes conflicts with the scope of other people's wishes. In our country, all the wishes of the people are directed towards a common goal—creating happiness for millions of people. The strength of the moral and political unity of the Soviet people is great.

　　Discipline is a manifestation of a person's inner moral consciousness. Makarenko talked about two forms of discipline: (1) the discipline of obedience or the discipline of order, (2) the discipline of struggle and overcoming. Conscious obedience and organized struggle constitute an inseparable unity. The bourgeois school, which reflects the national violent system, only cultivates the discipline of obedience, or more precisely, the discipline of suppression. Our Soviet school is cultivating conscious communist fighters. It teaches people to obey and overcome difficulties for the benefit of the common cause.

　　Makarenko believed that communist education should proceed along two paths: from consciousness to behavior and from behavior to consciousness. This is a necessary condition for cultivating a complete personality that matches words with deeds. Communist consciousness and communist behavior should constitute a whole. The one-sidedness of the effect on personality will inevitably lead to educational errors. If we only act on consciousness, if we limit ourselves to education, then, as Makarenko said in the article "Will, Determination, Purposefulness," we will create some shameful observers of other people's merits from our hands, and they themselves will be unable to engage in heroic actions. Therefore, children must be trained in various activities. In order to describe this idea, for example, we point out how Makarenko used to make children accustomed to overcoming fear. In the Dzerzhinsky Commune, the students organized a guard team. Of course, no one dared to rob the commune of the People's Committee of Internal Affairs, but there were guard team guards on duty day and night next to the safe placed in the front hall. In this unique form of important games, people's courage is cultivated. Makarenko said: "What is courage? A person is afraid, but he is doing what needs to be done."

　　The issue of cultivating moral habits is also the same. Moral habits, in a certain sense of this term, are expressed automatically. When a person is accustomed to acting, he does not reveal the moral significance of his actions. True communist habits are habits that a person expresses when he does not expect gratitude for his actions. He acts correctly due to deeply rooted moral habits, even though there is no social supervision of his actions. Makarenko said of this idea: "I was very surprised when I learned how difficult it is to get up on time and wipe the floor when no one is supervising you. But later I was not surprised. I saw that this is a normal collective action, a normal human action, and a normal human action is the simplest and easiest action."

　　What are the means of cultivating communist morality? According to Makarenko's general ideas, these means can be conditionally divided into two groups: (1) means that directly affect the consciousness of the educated, (2) means that directly form his behavior.

　　Education and other forms of direct ideological influence belong to the first group.

　　In Makarenko's education system, education and culture account for a large proportion. He once said: "Education in our country is a part of our country's life. It is no longer the erudition of life consumers, but has become the weapon of life creators."

　　Regarding the significance of school learning for the formation of students' communist consciousness, Makarenko wrote in "The Road to Life": "Our school work gave the students of the labor colony a lot of political education and deepened their political education. The students of the labor colony proudly realized that they were proletarians, and thoroughly understood the difference between their position and the position of rural youth."

　　In Makarenko's practice, the symposium on communist morality was a powerful means of moral and political influence on children. Makarenko himself had a moral teaching syllabus, which he personally formulated, and he used various opportunities to explain this syllabus to his students. He attached great significance to these symposiums. In one of his lectures, he expressed his firm belief that in the development of Soviet schools, we will inevitably reach the point of moral teaching.

　　The ideological and political foundation of Makarenko's education system is profound, and it is the source of the formation of children's communist morality.

　　Children's productive labor, sports, children's artistic activities and social work should be included in the second group of moral education means.

　　In Makarenko's practice, a complete system of cultural education work was created for children. This system is full of profound ideological and political content and can meet the needs of children in various forms of activities.

　　Many measures implemented by Makarenko have comprehensive characteristics. For example, in the Dzerzhinsky Commune, trips are organized every year. Trips to Moscow, Crimea, and the Caucasus—this is a brilliant page in the life of the commune. The unpublished novel "Φ—I" describes the trip to the Caucasus in detail. When reading these descriptions, readers will see how the students' general horizons are broadened during the trip, how the students' simple ideas and concepts are broken, how children's health is exercised during the trip, how children's will and character are cultivated by overcoming difficulties, how emotionally and politically consistent emotions are developed on the basis of organized exchanges with workers of various republics and nationalities, how students' social and political worldviews are expanded, and how students' inspiring Soviet patriotism is cultivated.

　　马卡伦柯的生平与其教育学说（中）
    （四）
    “只有在集体中，个体才能获得那使得以全面发展自己素质的手段……，”马卡伦柯从这个马克思主义的命题出发宣布了一种新的教育逻辑，依照这种逻辑，教育应当由集体走向各别的个性。
    马卡伦柯只是把基于社会主义团结原则的社会性统一，称作集体。团结的社会主义性质，首先是由它所有的先进的、进步的目的所决定的。在人们的集体组织中，表现出了为了把人类从剥削的羁绊下解放出来的阶级斗争之思想。作为社会主义型组织的集体，乃是建立在劳动者们自觉的和自愿的团结之基础上的。
    马卡伦柯站在这个立场上，对于集体观上的生物学化倾向，作了摧毁性的批评。在教育著作中，下面这个定义曾是特别流行的：“所谓集体，乃是相互作用的人们的一个集团，他们对于外部的刺激有共同的反应”。马卡伦柯经常对自己的敌人证明：相互作用和反应，这不是社会的标志，而是生物的征候。
    马卡伦柯说，儿童集体乃是一种苏维埃社会生活的现象。
    非正确理解的“逻辑”，把教育看作教师对学生的“成对影响”的过程，而与教育的社会性的条件无关。新的逻辑，苏维埃教育学的逻辑，不排除这种成对的教育体系，如果在这种场合里教师是代表集体、为集体利益而行动的话。
    在集体教育下，教育者的领导作用和组织作用，比在成对教育体系下要高得不可比拟。教师必须仔细注视儿童们的集体生活，并就集体中所发生的一切事件，作出坚定的意见。教师应当善于根据已经形成的意见，给儿童集体的机关予以正确的忠告，在某一场合下怎样行动。在这里，教师应当特别机敏，以保存儿童们在解决集体生活问题时的独立自主的幻觉。教师必须是一个有坚强意志的人。教师的意志应当成为全集体的意志。意见、忠告、机敏和意志，按照马卡伦柯的意见，这就是规定对儿童集体的教育领导道路的基本路线。
    依照马卡伦柯的话，初级集体是“接触个性的主要方法”。教师必须永远注意个别个性的个体品质之教育，但是为了这，教师必须首先培养每个学生对于自己同学的集体的责任感。这些新的教育关系是由以集体原则组织儿童生活的必要性所约制的，这种关系就成了马卡伦柯钻研所谓平行作用教育学之论据。
    平行作用教育学的本质，是在于：对初级集体之影响，是遵守某种教育上的机敏，由于这种机敏，个别的个性感觉到自己不是教育的对象，而是劳动集体生活的参加者。马卡伦柯说道：“我们是不处理个性的。正式的公式是这样的。在实质上说，这正是影响个性的形式，但公式是与实质平行的。”
    马卡伦柯所提出的平行作用逻辑的思想，是在集体中影响个性的个体特性形成之社会因素之教育组织之最完备的形式。
    儿童集体具有一种使它区别于成人集体的特有特点。这就是儿童活动的游戏性质，这种活动的目的是在达到具有社会意义的重大任务。
    在马卡伦柯的教育实践中，所谓“军事化”曾是儿童集体游戏的形式。集体编制是队分成，每队设一队长，阅兵式行进，有旗、有鼓和管弦乐队，命令，敬礼，号角，报告，岗警保护财产和秩序，这就是充满儿童集体生活的一种游戏之主要成分。
    集体运动和发展的主要条件，乃是同更大的集体之间的联系。在自己学生的面前展开了未来欢喜的光明道路，马卡伦柯已把他们从工学团的生活引导到全苏联的生活。他锐敏地倾听儿童集体的脉搏跳动，沉重地体验生长之迟缓或停止，而迅速地以恢复或扩展发展远景的道路，推动集体。马卡伦柯深信：“……大集体的利益，不是出自于简单的交往，而是出自于更深的社会的综合，只有通过这样大的集体，才能进到广大的政治教育。”
    马卡伦柯经过扩充集体界限的方法，培养集体成员的最高尚的特点——善于使自己的利益服从社会的利益。马卡伦柯认为把个人道路脱离社会任务，乃是集中化的市侩习气之表现。他教导自己的学生要从人们社会重要性的观点来评价他们。
    与广大政治前途对儿童共产主义教育的意义的问题相联系，马卡伦柯指出：个别集体的“闭关自守”和放弃重大的社会任务，都是不允许的。集体只有踏上了社会政治生活的大道，它才算是集体。
    马卡伦柯在考察儿童集体劳动生活组织诸问题时，曾讲了一系列关于集体中纪律的极重要、极有价值的思想。首先，我们应当指出马卡伦柯与若干教育学理论家关于一个基本问题之分歧点，这个问题便是：什么是自觉的纪律？教育学中智性派的代表们（他们否认训练在纪律教育中的作用和意义），都肯定地说，纪律是出自于儿童们的纯洁意识，未受成年人方面的影响，所以它被称作自觉的纪律，正确些说，称作“自我纪律”或“自我组织”。与这种唯心观念相反，马卡伦柯提出了一个从辩证唯物主义观点看来正确的命题：自觉的纪律意味着对纪律的必要性、有用性、义务、和它的阶级意义之理解。按照他的意见，纪律，不仅是从纯粹的智性上的信服中，不只是从思想中产生的，而且是从社会经验，从实际的同志关系的、集体的行动中产生的。
    马卡伦柯将我们社会中的纪律视作一种政治的和道德的现象。所以他的学生们把纪律看成“每一个集体的天然的和必要的状态。”
    马卡伦柯关于集体中纪律的教育思想，是他创造性地摄取列宁、斯大林关于社会主义社会中日常的、劳动的、自觉的、自由的和铁的纪律的学说之成果。
    马卡伦柯的集体教育之重要条件，乃是儿童集体中传统——规则与习惯的积累，这种规则与习惯，每一个人不是以“纯洁的意识”，而是以对于年长一代之经验的自觉尊重、对整个集体的伟大权威的自觉尊重来接受的。
    在传统的基础上，渐渐地培养成了集体中的作风和情调。它从冲动的、傲慢的、聒噪的、痛苦的、垂头丧气的、悲观的作风转为健康的、主调的作风了，这种作风为马卡伦柯集体所特有，马卡伦柯认为作风和情调，以及集体核心的问题，乃是教育学的最重要的部分。
    不仅教师们应该关心集体中的纪律，而且纪律还应当成为集体的传统。
    马卡伦柯根据儿童对所布置的任务之自觉的态度，将他们团结为集体，他还用对儿童的感情作用来补充集体教育体系。这个作用的目的，乃是培养荣誉感，骄傲感和责任感，它的内容是革命的浪漫性。
    集体对于马卡伦柯，是一个一定的个体世界。他极透辟地揭露了那未遭受利己主义损害的儿童天性之特点，同时他也揭露了离开理想的道德面容的偏向。马卡伦柯曾以组织各种各样个性接近与合作之方法，做到了儿童性格之完善。所以，在组织初级集体时，他采取混合编组的原则，这个原则，生动地叙述在下面的话中：“高尔基工学团学生们，也是以那样的谨慎的关注来加以区分的：强的与弱的，精力充沛的与孤立无助的，严峻的与快乐的，真实的人们和自利的人们，——所有这些都依着不同的考虑而找到了自己的地位。”
    在工学团学生和公社社员共同劳动的条件下，马卡伦柯培养了他们互相的友谊和同志关系，这种友谊和同志关系是以互相尊敬、互相帮助、互相保护和互相纠正错误为基础的。
    马卡伦柯认为集体中的偷窃行为是同志关系的特别具有破坏作用的因素。他曾经说过：“一个密切的集体中的偷窃行为……破坏了共同的幸福情调，毁灭了同志们彼此之间的信任，把猜忌，关切私人物品的最可厌的本能，小心翼翼的，伪装的利己主义引入到生活中。假使偷窃犯没有揭发出来，则集体就立刻会分裂为若干方向：在宿舍里发生窃窃私语，在秘密谈话中嚷着可疑者的名字，数十种性格遭受最沉重的考验，而恰恰是愿意保持而又那极难以调和的性格……偷窃属于集体中那些频繁的现象，在这些现象里，没有影响的主体，其中化学的反应多于有害的意志。”
    Ａ·Ｃ·马卡伦柯创立了儿童集体的精确的有组织的机构，把它分成初级集体，这些初级集体，依照情况之不同，可以按学校的、生产的或年龄的原则配备之。初级集体之领导者，与坚强的青年团组织紧密团结起来，他们不是指派的，而是在全体大会上，经小队提出候选人后，选举的。所有初级集体的领导者，组成集体的理事会——儿童集体的中央机关，这一中央机关处理集体中的一切日常工作，全体大会是自治的主要机关，它的威信，应当用儿童教育机关的一切力量坚决支持之。
    在正确的教育影响下，集体理事会和学生全体大会的决定，不仅不破坏儿童教育机关领导的一长制，相反，而是巩固它了。行政当局，从一方面言，似乎是对集体理事会揭示决定，而从另一方面言，则是引证这些决定，以之加强自己的措施。
    与初级集体并列，依照需要，得从初级集体的代表中组织若干不大的临时混合组，去完成一定的劳动任务。小队的指挥员可以作这些混合组的普通成员，而初级队的普通成员，又可以作这些混合组的指挥员。组织混合组的目的是在：一方面，预防“领导阶级”的形成，另一方面，则是培养新的领导干部，在组织职能中训练普通学生。
    马卡伦柯的经验中所实现的儿童集体组织的民主原则，曾促进了儿童们政治觉悟性、组织性、责任心、自动精神之培养，这些都是为了成功地完成学习任务及生产任务所必须的。
    Ａ·Ｃ·马卡伦柯把自己的一般的集体教育的理论，推广到家庭集体条件下的儿童教育。
    多儿的和巩固的家庭，不怕因人数少而来的“物理崩溃”，也不怕因父母间招致离婚的不正常关系而来的“化学分解”。只有在这样家庭的条件下，才有可能正确地组织儿童共产主义教育。
    Ａ·Ｃ·马卡伦柯关于作为共产主义教育因素的儿童集体的学说，以及与它相联系的儿童集体教育的理论，以摆脱了资产阶级教育学理论影响的新命题，丰富了苏维埃教育学，从而对于它们之应用于实践，开辟了广大的可能性。

    马卡伦柯通常不是就其组成部分，而是整体地来考察共产主义道德教育的问题的。这是由于两个原因：
    第一、马卡伦柯深信：一个人是在他自己的活动过程中综合地培养出来的。所以，教育家应当处理的，不是共产主义道德教育中某些个别任务，而是全部任务，这些任务则是在儿童活动的具体形式中——在学习中、在生产劳动中、在游戏中、在艺术创作中以及在社会工作中同时实现的。
    列宁在青年团第三次代表大会上曾说过：“应当使共产主义青年团在自觉而有纪律的劳动中教育一切人，从青年时候、从十二岁起。”马卡伦柯依照列宁的这个指示研究了一系列的命题。马卡伦柯在他的“劳动教育”（他这样称呼它并不是偶然的）讲演中，把共产主义道德教育的许多基本问题——苏维埃爱国主义教育，对待劳动、对待公共财产、对待集体的社会主义态度，都包括在劳动过程中。
    第二、马卡伦柯之关切苏维埃人的道德面貌，不仅是作为一个教育家，而且是作为一个以艺术形象概括苏维埃社会生活广泛现象的作家来关切苏维埃人们的道德表现面貌的。因此，共产主义个性的形成问题，在他所研究的共产主义道德教育的其他问题中间，占据着中心地位。由于这，正如上面我们已经说过的，马卡伦柯给个性的心理学特点的学说添加了许多新的思想。
    马卡伦柯在其著作中，光辉地说明了道德的阶级历史性。列宁有一个指示说：“教士、地主、资产阶级假上帝之名以说教，为的实施他们剥削者自己的利益。”马卡伦柯根据这一指示，对宗教伦理体系作了无情的批判。
    “这些伦理体系之必要，是为了使阶级的压迫，使普遍而什么也不能抑制的剥削都能够带着‘圣洁的良知’而和最巨大的成功存在。”
    资产阶级道德是由上帝意旨而得来的，它的主要特点，乃是极度的个人主义和悲观主义。“人们丧失了对于自由生活任何代用品的一切希望以后，便决定了去干那在悲观主义的个人主义中寻得这一自由的自杀企业……”
    共产主义道德的特征是集体主义和乐观主义。这种集体主义和乐观主义则是建设共产主义的苏维埃人民的精神和政治的统一中产生的。列宁一段名言说：“道德乃是用以摧毁旧的剥削社会，把一切劳苦大众团结在创造共产主义新社会的无产阶级周围的东西。”马卡伦柯曾引证这几句话，得出了一个品评苏维埃人行为的一般标准：“我们的行为应当只用集体及集体成员的利益来衡量。”
    马卡伦柯提出了两个最重要的任务，这两个任务是在辩证的统一的：
    第一个任务是根据列宁斯大林的学说，创立在实践中可以实现的共产主义伦理学体系，这一体系应当抛弃历史上存在过的一切道德法典。这一体系应当是把对问题的哲学研究与我们社会伦理道德传统的说明之结合起来。这一方面的整个工作应当服从于实践的目的。
    第二个任务是反对人们意识中的资本主义残余。资产阶级的伦理学，不仅作为一种道德习惯，而且作为一种道德的逻辑，都是富有生命力的。
    马卡伦柯在进而直接研究这一问题时，指出对旧的道德观念与概念和表象有加以批评分析的必要。
    首先必须就不同的道德观念和概念的实质来区分同名的名称。马卡伦柯说：“‘正直之人’的正直，其意思就是说：‘我不要别人的东西’，‘我不要多余的东西’，‘我不要非正义的东西’。”“我们的正直应当是一种对自己和对别人的积极要求：我要、并且要求于自己及别人的是充分注意公共利益，充分的工作时间，对自己事业的充分能力，力量之充分发展，充分的知识，我要、并要求有最完美的最正确的行动。”
    与此并列，发生了一个关于用新内容填充旧的道德概念名称的问题。例如，妒忌，表现私有者的一种可恶感情，而另一方面，“如何才能没有忌妒地爱，如何才能爱而不妒忌。”类此的一些问题，毫无疑问，须要回答，而它们不应当遗漏于我们注意之外的。
    最后，必须给我们的道德法典加入一些新的概念。“例如，在共产主义社会中，精确性和守时，表现明确、要求明白、回答明白等能力，不仅从业务的观点来加以检查，而且应当从伦理观点加以检查。”
    马卡伦柯关于共产主义道德诸问题的全部思想，都是导向培养鼓舞人心的苏维埃爱国主义，培养对于劳动，对于公共财产、对于集体的社会主义态度的。
    当论到爱国主义教育时，马卡伦柯对革命的警觉性赋予极大的意义。他指出了这样的现象，比如有条件的“共产党性”，它表现于口头上的伪装，行为上的拟态：“最近几年来，我们曾有机遇深信：某些特别滔滔不绝地宣扬自己革命性的人，都成了革命的暗藏敌人。”或者：“外部行动在某种程度上也是真实本质的有条件的标志”。马卡伦柯关于人的真实性格号召消灭行为之外部标志之这种条件性，象征性。
    马卡伦柯说，劳动在我们国家里不仅是一个经济的范畴，而且也是一个道德的范畴。斯大林同志教导我们说，劳动在我们国家里已从一种不名誉的负担变成了荣誉、勇敢、英雄的事业。因此，马卡伦柯总结说，为基督教伦理学所辩护的乞食行为在我们这里乃是道德堕落的表征。马卡伦柯首先在把自觉的高度生产性劳动作为他社会主义性格基本表征的计划中，来考察一个苏维埃人的道德标准的。
    马卡伦柯关于对公共财产态度的思想是极为深湛的。论到共产主义的基本原则：“各尽所能，各取所需”时，马卡伦柯指出：这条原则对于贪图一切的个人主义者是不可理解的，个人主义者认为在共产主义时代，一切的人都将攻袭公共财富的。马卡伦柯骄傲地指出：“就在现在，我们国家内已有很多人能够按这条公式而生活，而不抢占，不向自己家里带任何东西。”
    在我们社会里，社会主义关系表现在苏维埃人互相尊敬之中。在资产阶级社会中，一个人的愿望范围，是与别个人的愿望范围冲突的。在我们国家里，人们的一切愿望都是朝向一个共同目的——为千万人创造幸福。苏维埃人民的道德上政治上的统一的力量是伟大的。
    纪律就是一个人的内在道德意识的表现形式。马卡伦柯说到纪律的两种形式：（一）服从的纪律或秩序的纪律，（二）斗争和克服的纪律。自觉的服从和有组织的斗争构成不可分的统一。反映国家暴力制度的资产阶级学校，只培养服从的纪律，确切些说，压制的纪律。我们苏维埃学校是培养共产主义的自觉战士的，它教导人为了共同事业的利益而服从并克服困难。
    马卡伦柯认为，共产主义教育应当循着两条道路进行：从意识到行为和从行为到意识。这是培养言行一致的完整个性的必要条件。共产主义的意识和共产主义的行为应当构成一个整体。对于个性的作用的片面性，不可避免地要造成教育上的错误。假如我们仅作用于意识，假如我们只限于教育，那么，如马卡伦柯在“意志、果敢、目的性”一文中所说的，将从我们手中造成一些别人功绩的可耻的观察者，而他们自己则无能从事英雄的作为。因此，必须在各种各样的活动里训练儿童。为了描述这一思想，例如，我们指出马卡伦柯曾怎样使儿童习于克服恐惧，乃是很有趣的。在捷尔仁斯基公社里，曾由学生组织了警卫队。当然，没有一个人敢抢劫人民内政委员部的公社的，然而，放在前厅里的保险箱旁，却有警卫队的岗警日夜值勤。在这个重要游戏的特异形式中，培养人的勇敢。马卡伦柯说：“什么是勇敢呢？一个人在害怕着，但却作着须要作的事情。”
    培养道德习惯的问题，也是如此。道德习惯，就这个名辞的某种意思说，乃是自动表现的。一个人在习惯行动的时候，是不揭露自己这种作为的道德意义的。真正的共产主义习惯，乃是一个人不为自己的作为而期待感谢的时候所表现出来的一种习惯。他由于根深蒂固的道德习惯而正确地行动着，尽管对他的作为没有社会的监督。马卡伦柯就这种思想说：“我当初很惊奇，当我知道没有人监督你时按时起床，擦地板是如何困难的时候。但后来我不诧异了，我看到这就是一种正常的集体的行动、正常的人类的作为，而正常的人类的作为便是最简单最容易的作为。”
    培养共产主义道德的手段是什么呢？按照马卡伦柯的一般观念，这些手段可以有条件地分作两组：（一）直接作用于受教养者的意识的手段，（二）直接形成他的行为的手段。
    教育和直接的思想影响之其他形式，属于第一组。
    马卡伦柯的教育体系中，教育与文化所占比重是极大的。他曾说：“教育在我们国家里乃是我们国家的生活的一部分，它已不复是生活消费者的博学博识，而已成为生活创造者的武器了。”
    关于学校学习对于学生共产主义自觉性形成的意义，马卡伦柯在“教育诗篇”中写道：“我们学校的作业给了工学团学生以许多政治教育，并且加深他们的政治教育了。工学团学生们骄傲地意识到自己是无产者，并极透彻地理解了自己立场同农村青年立场之间的差别。”
    在马卡伦柯的实践中，关于共产主义道德问题的座谈乃是对儿童的道德政治影响的有力手段。马卡伦柯自己有一道德的讲授大纲，这是他亲自拟订的，他利用各种机会把这个大纲讲给自己的学生。他曾赋予这些座谈会以巨大的意义，在他自己的一次讲演中，他表示他深信：在苏维埃学校的发展中，我们不可避免地将达到道德的讲授。
    马卡伦柯教育体系的思想政治基础是深刻的，它是儿童共产主义道德形成的源泉。
    儿童的生产劳动、体育，儿童的艺术活动和社会工作应当列入道德教育手段的第二组。
    在马卡伦柯的实践中，曾造成了一种在儿童中进行文化教育工作的完整体系。这个体系饱含深刻的思想政治内容，可以满足儿童在各种形式活动中的需要。
    马卡伦柯所实行的许多措施，有着综合的性质。例如，在捷尔仁斯基公社里，每年都组织旅行。莫斯科、克里米、高加索旅行——这便是公社生活中的灿烂之页。在未曾发表的小说“Φ—Ｉ”里，详细地描写了高加索的旅行。读这些描写时，读者会看到：在旅行时间中，学生们的一般眼界是如何扩大了，学生们的单纯的观念和概念是如何打破了，儿童健康在旅行中如何受到锻炼，怎样借克服困难而培养了儿童的意志与性格，怎样在有组织地与各共和国各民族劳动者交往的基础上发展了道德上政治上一致的情感，怎样扩展了学生们的社会的政治的世界观，怎样培养了学生们的鼓舞人心的苏维埃爱国主义。（本节完，全文下期续完）
