　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: The British Parliament, amidst an atmosphere of panic and unease last week during the debate on the situation in Malaya, openly admitted the failure of Britain's colonial war in Malaya; and launched a fierce attack on the Labor government. According to a United Press International, London dispatch: "Members of both houses (referring to Labour and Conservative parties) of the Lower House told the British government on the 6th that its policy in Malaya was a failure." Conservative MP Mr. Gammans complained: "The armed forces used by Britain today in Malaya to deal with 'bandits' are more than the troops used against the Japanese invaders in January 1942," "We cannot win this war; it is a tragedy." According to a Reuters dispatch, during a debate in the British Upper House on the 4th, Conservative peer Lord Mancroft admitted: "The situation in Malaya is not better than it was two years ago." He accused the Labor government of "completely misjudging the nature and importance of the war in Malaya."

　　When former British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, Sir Killearn, reported on the current situation in Malaya to the British Upper House on March 31st, he fearfully pointed out: "We are surrounded by enemies," and even places "about a mile from the Governor's office" are "unsafe." Killearn demanded the immediate appointment of a so-called "person with absolutely full power and authority" to "deal with that particularly tense situation." Colonial Secretary Griffiths, in his reply to the Lower House, also helplessly admitted: "We have nothing else to think about the situation in Malaya other than that it is very serious," and "no one can expect a quick and easy solution to this problem." He also admitted that as a result of intensified so-called "mopping up" operations since the beginning of this year, the number of attacks by the Malayan People's Army has instead "increased to fifty times per week, reaching a maximum of sixty times."

　　侵略马来亚政策失败了
    英国会中一片埋怨声
    【新华社十二日讯】英国国会于上周在充满慌乱不安的气氛中辩论马来亚局势时，公开承认英国在马来亚的殖民战争的失败；并对工党政府展开了猛烈的攻击。据合众社伦敦讯：“下院双方（指工党及保守党）议员于六日都告诉英国政府，它在马来亚的政策是失败了”。保守党议员加门斯抱怨说：“英国今日在马来亚用来对付“土匪”的武装部队，已比一九四二年一月对付日本侵略者的队军为多”，“我们不能赢得这个战争，这是一个悲剧”。另据路透社消息，英国上院在四日辩论中，保守党上议员曼克莱夫特发言承认：“马来亚的局势并不比两年前好一些”。他指责工党政府“对于马来亚战争的性质与重要性完全判断错误”。
    英前驻东南亚特别专员基林爵士三月三十一日在英上院报告马来亚目前的局势时，恐惧地指出：“我们四周都是敌人”，并且，连“离总督衙门一英里路光景”的地方，也都是“不安全的”。基林要求立即委派一个所谓“有绝对充分权力和权威的人”，去“应付那特别紧张的局势”。殖民大臣葛里菲斯在下院作答时，也无可奈何地承认：“我们对于马来亚的情形没有别的，只有认为它是很严重的，”而且“没有人能期望这个问题能有迅速和容易的解决。”他又承认今年以来加紧所谓“清剿”的结果，马来亚人民军队进攻的次数，每星期反而“增加到五十次，最多时到过六十次”。
