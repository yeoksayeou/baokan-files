Why do some cooperative contracts fail?

The contract system adopted by cooperatives in North China has been generally successful; however, some contracts have failed or have not been fully implemented as stipulated in the contract.

According to the implementation of the contract system by cooperatives in various regions, in Chahar Province, out of 180 contracts, 139 were completed, 18 were overdue, 11 were cancelled midway, 2 were signed but never implemented, and the situation of 10 was unclear. In total, contracts that were not well completed accounted for over 22% of the total. In Beijing, out of 48 contracts, 9 were overdue and 2 were not completed; in total, contracts that were not well completed accounted for just under 23% of the total. In the Changzhi area of Shanxi province, out of 2,148 contracts of the county cooperatives, 5 were not completed and 2 were overdue (Note: the area's view that delays of three to five days are not considered overdue is incorrect, and in reality the number of overdue contracts is higher). Uncompleted contracts accounted for just over 0.03% of the total. The reasons why some contracts were not well completed:

            Serious pursuit of profit damages the contract

First, there is a serious pursuit of profit and a lack of good faith. Some cadres in cooperatives or state commercial departments still seriously harbor confused ideas, thinking, "We are all public entities, it doesn't matter whether the contract is executed or not!" "We are all on the same side, no one can do anything to anyone!" Some cooperative cadres, only seeking the profit of the cooperative, have not relied on the masses, and have not well combined with the interests of the masses, therefore, some contracts are not actively supported by the masses, and thus cannot be implemented. Some cadres of state-owned commercial departments, in order to seek more profit, even violate contracts, not relying on cooperatives, but relying on private merchants, such as the Nanyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company's contract with the Nanyuan Cooperative to purchase cotton. Although there were clear provisions: "In areas with cooperatives, if the cooperative can undertake the task of collecting cotton, the branch company will no longer set up cotton collection agencies or entrust private merchants to purchase." However, in the process of implementation, the company entrusted four private merchants to purchase, and the price of cotton collected by the cooperative did not follow the government's regulations. Therefore, the credibility of the contract was undermined. There is also a third situation, where each party wants to take advantage of the other, which often makes the relationship between the two sides very bad. This is narrow departmentalism at work. All this shows a lack of understanding of the political tasks of state commerce and cooperatives. Therefore, the key to implementing the contract system in the future, in addition to relying on political consciousness and political foresight, must also be guaranteed by discipline: "All business dealings between economic organizations must strictly adhere to good faith, and when the other party defaults, they may file a complaint with the court." (Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on unifying national financial and economic work)

            Ambiguous wording provides excuses for disputes

Secondly, some cooperative cadres, due to unfamiliarity with the business, are not good at careful calculation, and are not good at writing each and every word of the contract clearly and definitely, with clear responsibilities for each other. Therefore, some contracts have not been well completed, such as the cotton-wheat contract between the Tunliu County Cooperative and the Changzhi Grain Company. Due to lack of careful calculation, before the fifty-day deadline, the price of cotton fell and the price of grain rose, and the cooperative could not deliver 120,000 jin of grain, and had to compensate 40,000 jin of grain. Another example is the transportation contract between the Lucheng County Cooperative and the Shexian Railway Bureau, which did not take into account weather changes, and a seven-day contract took a month to transport, costing two million Jiao banknotes. Other examples include the Beijing Cooperative's order contract with shoe factories, which was delayed due to failure to grasp price trends. Also, some contract terms are written ambiguously, often creating excuses for disputes between the parties. Therefore, when signing a contract, in addition to being good at careful calculation, one should also have the spirit of thinking for the other party. Only by being responsible to each other and comprehensively considering the issues can the contract be successfully implemented jointly, and everyone can benefit.

            Lack of investigation into production and sales renders contract provisions meaningless

The third reason is that some cooperative cadres lack investigation and research into production and sales before signing the contract, which often leads to the contract being aborted or the cooperative collapsing due to losses. For example, Datong City does not produce iron shovels, but the Datong City Cooperative blindly signed a contract with the Sihai County Cooperative to supply iron shovels. As a result, no blacksmith would make them, and the contract was torn up. Another example is the Beijing Cooperative's contract for coal purchases. Because it did not understand that the masses needed coal briquettes, not coal lumps, and the masses could only buy as they used it due to low purchasing power, a lot of coal could not be sold. There is also the Beijing Cooperative's contract with the sewing cooperatives to make cotton clothes. Because it did not understand productivity, it ordered a lot of goods, making it impossible to complete the contract on time. The occurrence of such situations is obviously the result of some cooperative cadres still treating the new scientific contract system with a rough and careless management style.

If the above shortcomings are corrected, the contract system can be improved.

### 有些合作社合同为什么失败？

　　有些合作社合同为什么失败？
    华北各地合作社采用合同制，基本上是成功的；但也有少数的合同是失败了，或没有完全按合同规定顺利实现。
    根据各地合作社执行合同制的情形，察哈尔省社一八○次合同中，完成的合同一三九次，脱期的十八次，中途作废的十一次，签订而终未实施的二次，情况不明的十次。总计没很好完成的合同占总数的百分之二十二强。北京市社四十八次合同中，脱期的九次，没完成的二次；总计没很好完成的合同占总数的百分之二十三弱。山西长治专区各县社二一四八次合同中，没完成的五次，脱期的二次（按：该地将脱期三、五天不算脱期的看法，这是不对的，实际上脱期的并不只此数）。没完成的合同占总数的百分之点零三强。有些合同没有很好完成的原因：
            单纯营利观点严重损害合同
    第一，是单纯营利观点和不讲信用。有些合作社或国家商业部门的干部，还严重地存在着这样一些糊涂的想法，认为“都是公家，执行不执行都可以！”“自己人没说的，谁也不能怎样谁！”甚至有些合作社干部，只图社的盈利，而没有依靠群众，没有与群众的利益很好结合，因此，有些合同，群众不积极支持，因而实行不通；也有些国营商业部门的干部，为多图利润，甚至可以违背合同，不依靠合作社，而依靠私商，如南苑花纱布支公司与南苑合作社订的收购棉花合同，虽有明文规定：“有合作社地区者，合作社能担负收棉花任务者，支公司不再设收棉机构及委托私商收购。”但在执行过程中，公司方面既委托了四家私商收购，对合作社收棉价格又不按政府的规定。因此，破坏了合同的信用。还有第三种情形，即相互之间都想多沾对方的便宜，往往使双方关系搞得很不好。这是狭隘的本位主义作怪，这都是不了解国家商业和合作社的政治任务。所以，今后实现合同制的关键，除了依靠政治的自觉性和政治的远见外，还必须加上一条纪律的保证：“一切经济机关之间的营业往来，必须严守信用，凡属对方失信时，得向法庭控告。”（中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定）
            条文规定模棱两可造成双方争执借口
    其次，是有些合作社干部，由于对业务不熟悉，还不善于精打细算，还不善于在合同的条文上一字一句都写得明白肯定，彼此责任都分的清清楚楚。所以，有些合同便没很好完成，如屯留县社和长治粮食公司的棉麦合同，由于没有精打细算，未到五十天的期限，花落粮涨，合作社有十二万斤粮食不能交上，还要赔四万斤粮食。又如潞城县社与涉县铁路局的运输合同，没计算到天气变化，订了七天的合同，运输了一个月，赔了冀钞二百万元。其他如北京市社与制鞋厂的订货合同，也是因为没掌握物价趋势而脱期。还有些合同的条文，写的模棱两可，经常造成双方争执的借口。所以，订合同时，除了自己应善于精打细算外，还应该具有为对方着想的精神，只有互相负责，全面地考虑问题，才能顺利地共同实现合同，才能做到大家有利。
            产销情况缺乏调查合同规定形同具文
    第三个原因，是有些合作社的干部，在订合同之前，对产销情况，缺乏调查研究，结果常常使合同遭到夭折或使合作社因亏损垮台，例如大同市本不生产洋铁铣，而大同市社即盲目和四海县社订了供给洋铁铣的合同，结果没一家铁匠会做，因而撕毁了合同。又如北京市社订的批煤合同，因不了解群众需要煤球，不需要煤块，群众因购买力低，只能现用现买，致很多存煤无法卖出。还有北京市社与缝制社订做棉衣合同，因不了解生产力，即订了很多货，使合同不能按期完成。类似这些情形的发生，显而易见，是由于一些合作社干部，仍然以粗枝大叶的经营方式，来对待新的科学的合同制的结果。
    注意纠正了上述的缺点，合同制是可以改进的。
