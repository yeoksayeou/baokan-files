　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works Rolling Mill Small Plant
    Continues to Set New Records for Overproduction
    Implementing the Production Responsibility System is Key to Improving Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the implementation of the production responsibility system in March at the small plant of the Rolling Mill Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, employees have generally increased their sense of responsibility, actively studied and improved technology, and continuously set new records for overproduction. On March 11th, Class B of the plant rolled 19mm round steel, creating a record of exceeding the original production task by 33.8 percent. Due to the heated production competition among the groups, Groups A, B, and C broke each other's overproduction records. By March 30th, when Group B rolled 16mm round steel, they created the highest new record of exceeding the production quota by 58.67 percent. Before the implementation of the production responsibility system, no one was specifically responsible for inspecting and repairing various parts of the machines, so problems often occurred, hindering work. For example, the outlet of the fifth rolling groove was divided into two sections, and the steel bar often got stuck during rolling, affecting production for more than an hour each time. Since the implementation of the responsibility system, after careful research by worker Liu Jiacai, the two sections of the fifth rolling groove outlet were welded together, eliminating the problem of steel bar jamming. He also installed a baffle at the entrance of the first roughing pass, reducing the problem of steel billets escaping to the lifting platform below. Lu Naitao, a worker in the heating crew, improved the gas pipe, making it easier for gas to flow and reducing the time spent cleaning the flue. The electric roller of the No. 2 heating furnace was often burned out by the furnace fire. Ding Shijun, a worker in the heating crew, installed a water spray pipe, which reduced its failures and losses. Thus, the smooth production of the plant was guaranteed, without breakdowns.
    In order to thoroughly implement the production responsibility system, the plant also clearly stipulated a reward and punishment system, further strengthening the workers' work enthusiasm. Under the leadership and mobilization of the Party in the plant, a team leader meeting system after work was established to discuss and summarize the team's experiences and problems, and tell the incoming workers, so that they have a clear direction in production and can improve production efficiency.

　　鞍钢轧钢部小型厂
    连续创超产额新纪录
    贯彻生产责任制是提高生产的关键
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司轧钢部小型厂，自三月份贯彻生产责任制以来，职工普遍提高工作责任心，积极钻研改进技术，连续创造超产额新纪录。三月十一日，该厂乙班轧十九粍圆钢，创造超原产额任务百分之三十三点八的纪录。由于各组间展开热烈的生产竞赛，甲、乙、丙三组互相突破生产超额纪录，至三月三十日乙组轧十六粍圆钢时，则创造超产额百分之五十八点六七的最高新纪录。在实行生产责任制以前，各部分机器，无人负专职检查及修理，因而常常发生毛病，阻碍工作。如第五道轧槽出嘴子是分成两节的，轧钢时，常常发生挤住钢条的故障，每次都要影响生产一点多钟。自实行责任制以后，经工人刘家财专心研究的结果，把第五道轧槽出嘴子两节焊成一起，消灭了挤钢条的故障。他并把粗轧第一道入口安装上一个挡板，减少了钢坯逃跑到升降台下面去的故障。加热班工人卢乃涛改进煤气管子，使煤气容易流通，减少了扫烟道的时间。第二号加热炉的电滚，常被炉火烧坏，加热班工人丁世钧装上一个喷水管，即减少了它的故障与损耗。于是，就保证该厂的顺利生产，不生故障。
    该厂为了彻底执行生产责任制，同时并明确的规定出奖惩制度，进一步加强了工人的工作情绪。并在该厂党的领导与发动之下，建立了下班后的班组长会议制度，讨论与总结本班的经验和问题，告诉给接班的工人，使他们在生产中有明确方向，可以提高生产效能。      （秦军）
