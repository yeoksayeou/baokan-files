According to the Hebei Daily: Red spider mites were discovered in wheat fields in the southern part of the Second District of Anping County. The county People's Government immediately instructed the entire county to inspect wheat fields block by block. Subsequently, each district successively discovered pests in some wheat fields. By March 25th, most of the wheat fields in the county had generally begun pest control. Driven by cadres and Party members at all levels in the county, the masses have been swept up in a wave of pest control. As of March 31st, according to incomplete statistics from 26 villages in the county, a total of 11,299 people were mobilized. The areas with the most severe pest infestation have been treated fifteen times, while the general areas have been treated four to six times. Currently, most of the red spider mite pests in the county have been eliminated, and the wheat seedlings have turned from yellowish-white to green.

　　In the process of mobilizing the masses for pest control, it is necessary to repeatedly educate the masses and overcome complacency and the mentality of leaving things to chance. The general public believes that red spider mites are present every year and "do not affect the harvest" or "do not eat wheat." However, when the wheat seedlings turn yellow, they are at a loss and develop a fatalistic and wishful-thinking mentality. Overcoming these ideas among the masses is an arduous task that requires repeated explanation. Zheng Village in the Second District of the county used various meetings to recall the situation last year when the wheat yield was reduced by 24% due to red spider mites, and compared it with the fact that catching locusts last autumn brought great benefits. This comparison enlightened the masses' enthusiasm for pest control. Of the more than 120 households in the village, more than 200 people participate in pest control every day.

　　At the same time, it is necessary to convene experienced old farmers and pest control experts in a timely manner to hold seminars, study and improve pest control methods, and then have Party members and cadres personally experiment before the masses' confidence in pest control can be strengthened and the masses can be mobilized. The cadres of Xiyulin Village in the Fifth District first tried the covering and wiping method with great success, and the masses immediately took action. The branch secretary and public security officer of Xingxian Village in the First District also achieved good results by using paste to kill and spraying tobacco water, which enhanced the masses' courage in pest control. From the beginning to the present, the masses in the county have used a total of fifteen methods, such as sweeping with brooms, rolling with rollers, and spraying tobacco water. Three methods can be promoted: First, tie grass to the hoe, push with each hoe, burying and wiping at the same time, which can kill insects and weed at the same time, but it must be hoeed repeatedly. Second, spray water along the ridges and then sprinkle with small ashes, which can kill most of the insects. Third, use a one-foot-wide board, apply paste, pull it along the wheat ridges with a rope, and have someone shake the wheat seedlings with wooden sticks behind. This will cause the red spider mites to fall off and stick to the paste, which is very effective. Sweeping down with a broom and then pushing with a hoe is also very effective.

### 安平全力扑灭红蜘蛛  虫害大部消灭麦苗已转绿色

　　安平全力扑灭红蜘蛛
    虫害大部消灭麦苗已转绿色
    【本报讯】据河北日报消息：安平县二区南部麦田发现红蜘蛛，该县人民政府即指示全县逐块检查麦田，各区遂相继在部分麦田中发现虫害。至三月二十五日，全县大部麦田已普遍进行捕虫。在该县各级干部、党员带动下，群众已卷入捕虫浪潮。截至三月三十一日，据该县二十六村不完全统计，共发动群众一万一千二百九十九人，虫害最多的地方已捕打十五遍，一般的打了四至六遍，现全县红蜘蛛虫害大部消灭，麦苗已由黄白色变为绿色。
    在发动群众捕虫过程中，必须反复教育群众，克服麻痹侥幸心理。一般群众认为红蜘蛛年年有，“不影响收成”、“不吃麦子”。及至麦苗变为黄色时，又束手无策，产生听天由命与侥幸思想。克服群众这些思想是个艰苦工作，必须反复进行解释。该县二区郑庄是通过各种会议，回忆去年麦子发生红蜘蛛减收了二成四的年景，与去秋捕蝗沾大光的事实进行对比，启发了群众的捕虫情绪。该村一百二十余户人家，每天参加捕虫的有二百多人。
    同时，必须及时召开老农及捕虫有经验的人开座谈会，研究改进捕打的方法，然后再由党员、干部的亲自试验，才能坚定群众捕虫信心和发动起群众。五区西羽林村干首先试用盖擦的方法收效很大，群众立即都行动起来。一区兴贤村支部书记、公安员用浆糊捕杀和烟水喷洒的办法收效也不小，增强了群众捕虫勇气。从开始到现在，该县群众共利用了扫帚擦、砘子轧、烟水喷洒等十五种办法，有三种办法可以推广：一、锄头上绑草把，一锄一推，连埋带擦，既能捕杀虫子，又能锄草，但必须要反复多锄。二、顺垅喷水，然后撒上小灰，能杀死大部。三、用一尺宽的板，抹上浆糊，顺麦垅用绳拉着走，后边有人用木棍震动麦苗；这样就使红蜘蛛掉下来黏住，效力很大。用扫帚扫下来再用锄推，作用也不小。
