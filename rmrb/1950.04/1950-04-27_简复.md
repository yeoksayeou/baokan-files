To Comrades Qi Huiquan and six others:
    Your suggestion that the People's Garden should publish as few "mail forwarding" notices as possible to avoid taking up space in the newspaper is correct, and we accept it.
    Currently, the "mail forwarding" notices in the People's Garden are partly for readers who did not provide a return address in their letters, making it impossible to contact them by mail; and partly for informing readers with a few words that their letters have been forwarded to relevant authorities for reference, which avoids having to reply to each one individually. We do not publish other "mail forwarding" notices.

    To Editor Jia Shangguo:
    The prices of books and periodicals sold by Xinhua Bookstore, Sanlian Bookstore, and International Bookstore, which are under the Publishing Bureau of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, have been adjusted to 1,000 times the basic price (previously 1,200 times) starting from April 21st to adapt to the decline in commodity prices and reduce the burden on readers, a reduction of slightly more than 17%; the prices of textbooks sold by the North China United Publishing House have been adjusted to 180 times the base price (previously 220 times), a reduction of slightly more than 18%.

          The Editor

　　简复齐卉荃等七位同志：
    你们建议人民园地上尽量少登“代邮”，以免占去报纸的篇幅。这个意见是对的，我们接受。
    现在人民园地上的代邮，一部分是读者来信时没写明通讯处，无法用信件联络的；一部分是读者的信已转有关机关参考，我们在报上用几个字通知一下，就可免去一一复信。其他代邮，我们是不刊登的。
          编者贾尚国君：
    中央人民政府出版总署出版局所属新华书店、三联书店、国际书店书刊售价，为适应物价下落情况，减轻读者负担，自四月二十一日起已改为按基本定价一千倍发售（原按一千二百倍发售），降低百分之十七强；华北联合出版社教科书售价，改为按基价一百八十倍发售（原按二百二十倍），降低百分之十八强。
