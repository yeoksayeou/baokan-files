　　Strengthen the Struggle to Defend Peace!
　　May Day Appeal from the Communist Parties of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, April 27th] TASS, Stockholm, April 26th: The leading organs of the Swedish Communist Party and local Communist Party organizations have suggested to the Social Democratic Party that they celebrate May Day under the slogan of working-class unity and hold joint parades and rallies. The right-wing Social Democratic leaders, adhering to their anti-labor policy of division, rejected this suggestion. However, trade union groups in some towns and industrial areas, regardless of the directives of the right-wing Social Democrats, have decided to hold joint parades and rallies.
　　The Political Bureau of the Swedish Communist Party issued May Day slogans to the country's working class. The slogans emphasized that "Defending peace is the most important task and main slogan of this year's May Day demonstrations." The Communist Party called on Swedish workers to turn the May Day celebrations into marches and demonstrations for peace, a better standard of living for working people, and socialism.
　　According to the newspaper "New Times," the number of trade union organizations participating in the Communist Party's Stockholm demonstration will greatly increase compared to last year. The following central councils of trade unions have decided to participate in the parade in the Swedish capital: the Electrical Workers' Union, the Pipe Fitters' Union, the Shipbuilders' Union of the Stockholm Naval Base, the Coal Miners' Union, and the Mud and Public Utility Workers' and Laborers' Union.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, April 27th] According to TASS and the Telecommunication Agency, the Norwegian Communist Party and the Danish Communist Party have both issued May Day appeals.
　　The Norwegian Communist Party's May Day appeal pointed out that the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty "intends to turn Norwegian youth into cannon fodder for American imperialists to use in wars against democracy and socialism." The militarization of Norway costs the people more than one million kroner every day; it abolishes the democratic rights of the working people and facilitates the strengthening of the reactionaries. The Norwegian Communist Party called on the working people to raise the following slogans during the May Day demonstration: "Strive for higher wages! Down with anti-labor legislation! We want houses, not ammunition boxes! Uphold peace! Support the prohibition of atomic bombs! Support disarmament! Norway must withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty!"
　　The Danish Communist Party called on Danish workers to demonstrate together with the Communist Party against rising prices, to strive for improved work and wages, to strive for freedom of the trade union movement, to strive for the withdrawal of Americans from Denmark and Denmark's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty, and for friendship with the Soviet Union.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, April 27th] According to TASS and the Telecommunication Agency, the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Executive Bureau of the Dutch Trade Union have successively issued May Day appeals.
　　The Italian General Confederation of Labor called on all democratic groups to unite around the working class on May Day and to declare their solidarity with the labor community. The General Confederation of Labor called on the working people of Italy to express their will in action on May Day, always striving in close ranks for the realization of the "Labor Plan" and social reforms, for increased wages, for respect for democratic and trade union rights, and for peace and against war preparations.
　　The appeal of the Executive Bureau of the Dutch Trade Union stated: "On May 1st, we will demonstrate for the unity of the working class, for solidarity with all democratic countries, and for friendship with the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and New China." "On May 1st, we will demand the destruction of atomic weapons, the cessation of the arms race and the Cold War, and the conclusion of a treaty by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States, Britain, and France to maintain world peace." The appeal also required workers to combine the working class's struggle to improve living conditions with the struggle to defend peace and uphold international friendship.

　　加强保卫和平斗争！
    瑞挪丹三国共产党五一号召
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十六日讯：瑞典共产党领导机关与地方共产党组织向社会民主党建议，在工人阶级团结的口号下，庆祝五一劳动节，并举行联合游行示威与大会。坚持反劳工的分裂政策的右翼社会民主党领袖们，拒绝了这个建议。可是，一部分城镇与工业区的工会团体，不管右翼社会民主党的指令，还是决定举行联合游行示威与大会。
    瑞典共产党政治局向该国工人阶级发布了五一节口号。口号强调称：“保卫和平是本年度五一节示威游行的最重要的任务与主要的口号。”共产党号召瑞典工人把五一节的庆祝会变为争取和平，争取劳动人民的美好的生活标准与争取社会主义的游行示威。
    据《新时代》报报道：参加共产党斯德哥尔摩示威游行的工会组织的数目，将比去年大为增多。瑞典首都已决定参加游行的有下述各工会的中央理事会：电器工人工会、装管工人工会、斯德哥尔摩海军基地的造船工人工会、掘煤工人工会、泥水公用事业工人与劳工工会等。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社与电通社报道：挪威共产党与丹麦共产党都发出了五一号召。
    挪威共产党的五一号召指出，侵略性的北大西洋公约“打算把挪威青年变成供美帝国主义者在反对民主和社会主义的战争中使用的炮灰”。挪威的军事化每天化费人民一百多万克罗纳，它废除了劳动人民的民主权利，便利了反动派的加强。挪威共产党号召劳动人民在五一节示威时提出下述口号：“争取较高工资！打倒反劳工立法！要房子而不要子弹箱！拥护和平！拥护禁止原子弹！拥护裁减军备！挪威一定要退出北大西洋公约！”
    丹麦共产党号召丹麦工人和共产党一道示威，反对物价增涨，争取工作和工资的改善，争取工会运动的自由，争取美国人撤出丹麦和丹麦退出北大西洋公约，以及和苏联友好。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社与电通社报道：意大利总工会与荷兰工会执行局已相继发出五一号召。
    意大利总工会号召一切民主团体在五一节团结在工人阶级的周围，并宣布他们与劳工界团结一致。总工会号召意大利的劳动人民在五一节用行动来表示他们的意愿，永远以紧密的队伍争取“劳工计划”和社会改革的实现，争取提高工资，争取对民主和工会权利的尊重，争取和平与反对备战。
    荷兰工会执行局的号召说：“在五月一日，我们将为工人阶级的团结，为与一切民主国家的团结一致，为与苏联、东欧国家和新中国的友谊而示威”。“在五月一日，我们将要求毁灭原子武器，停止军备竞赛和冷战，以及由苏联、中华人民共和国、美国、英国和法国缔结维护世界和平的公约”。号召又要求工人们必须把工人阶级力争改善生活条件的斗争，和保卫和平与拥护国际友谊的斗争结合起来。
