　　Wang Fushan's Apology Statement
    The article "Beijing Telephone Third Bureau, Work Efficiency Needs to Be Improved" that I sent to the People's Garden (published on March 24th, People's Garden) was sent out privately without organizational review before publication, resulting in it being inconsistent with the facts. The work efficiency of the Telecommunications Third Bureau is not low. When they installed the machines for us, it never took more than six days. However, due to insufficient contact between our regiment and the general team's communications section, the time was not clear, so the manuscript was sent out incorrectly. In addition to conducting a self-criticism, I also offer my apologies to the comrades of the Telecommunications Third Bureau.
                        Political Department, First Regiment, Public Security General Team, Wang Fushan

　　王福山道歉声明
    我寄给人民园地的“京市电话三分局，工作效率要提高”一文（登在三月二十四日人民园地），在发稿之前，并未经过组织审查，私自发出，致与事实不符。电讯三分局工作效率并不低，给我们按机子的时候，最迟没有超过六天，但因我团和总队通讯科连系不够，时间没闹清楚，故错发稿件；对此除应自行检讨外，并向电讯三分局同志致歉。
                        公安总队一团政治处  王福山
