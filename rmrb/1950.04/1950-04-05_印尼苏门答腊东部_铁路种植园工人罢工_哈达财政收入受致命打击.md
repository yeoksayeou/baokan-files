    铁路种植园工人罢工
    哈达财政收入受致命打击
    【新华社四日讯】印尼工人为要求增加工资改善非人生活，正不断展开罢工斗争。综合安尼塔社消息：东苏门答腊日里铁路公司的铁道和电话工人自三月二十二日开始举行的集体罢工，迄四月二日止仍在坚持中。这一罢工使东苏门答腊的火车交通完全陷于停顿，所有大种植园与地方出产品的输出，以及粮食、石油等必需品的运输，都已陷于麻痹。同时，东苏门答腊种植园工人工会因为资方于二日发表公报拒绝工会的增加工资的要求，已号召全体种植园工人在三日举行总罢工。安尼塔社棉兰二日电引“有资格人士”认为：种植园的总罢工对哈达政府的主要财政收入将是最致命的打击，其后果将极端严重。
