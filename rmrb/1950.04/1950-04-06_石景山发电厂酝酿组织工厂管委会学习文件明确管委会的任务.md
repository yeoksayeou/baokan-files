　　【本报讯】据“首都发电厂”报三月二十四日消息：石景山发电厂正积极酝酿组织工厂管理委员会。该厂自解放后，曾两度成立了管委会：第一次系由军代表指定人员参加；第二次系由职工代表大会产生的临时管理委员会。但均因未能紧紧依靠工人群众，使工人对管委会失掉信心，终致垮台。为了改变上述情况，以求能真正做到依靠全体职工办好人民企业的目的，该厂根据上级指示，积极布置这一工作。首先，根据本报社论“学会管理企业”，华北工人代表大会、北京首届工人代表大会的决议，并结合该厂过去管委会的缺点，在职工中进行学习与讨论。在学习、讨论中，工人曾严格地批评了过去行政、工会对管委会的轻视现象。第四小组的记录中写道：行政上处理事情，有时根本不通过管委会就进行，或者开始之后才提到管委会来，集起人员一通过就完事。行政上高兴就找你来，不高兴就不理你。工会也成了行政的“尾巴”。锅炉组认为过去管委会开会事先无准备，只是临时提问题，也不能很好解决。同时，工人们也批评了过去工人代表的单纯福利观点的错误。工友王衍庆说：过去就弄不清管委会是怎么回事，代表也不能代表群众的意见，开会就谈福利，成了个福利会。从这次讨论中，也可以看出过去酝酿是很不够的，如管委会委员工人苗树田说：咱还不知道管委会是干啥的哩，就把咱选上了。经过这次深入学习，工友们对这次成立管委会都充满了信心。一致认为：过去领导不重视，咱们也不太清楚管委会的任务是什么，所以弄得上下不接气，对生产没大帮助。今后一定做到有意见就提出，想尽一切办法把工厂办好！

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to a report from the "Capital Power Plant" newspaper on March 24th: The Shijingshan Power Plant is actively planning to organize a Factory Management Committee. Since liberation, the factory has twice established management committees: the first time, personnel were designated by military representatives to participate; the second time, it was a temporary management committee formed by the Workers' Representative Assembly. However, both times failed because they did not closely rely on the masses of workers, causing the workers to lose confidence in the management committee, ultimately leading to its collapse. In order to change the above situation and truly achieve the goal of relying on all employees to run the people's enterprise well, the factory is actively arranging this work according to instructions from higher authorities. First, based on our newspaper's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," the resolutions of the North China Workers' Representative Assembly and the first Beijing Workers' Representative Assembly, and in combination with the shortcomings of the factory's past management committees, learning and discussion are being conducted among the employees. During the learning and discussion, workers strictly criticized the past administrative and trade union's disregard for the management committee. The records of the fourth group wrote: In handling matters administratively, sometimes it is done without going through the management committee at all, or it is only brought up to the management committee after it has started, and it is finished once the personnel are assembled and passed. When the administration is happy, they look for you, when they are not happy, they ignore you. The trade union has also become the "tail" of the administration. The boiler group believes that in the past, the management committee meetings were unprepared, and problems were only raised temporarily, and they could not be resolved well. At the same time, the workers also criticized the past workers' representatives' errors of having a simple welfare-oriented view. Comrade Worker Wang Yanqing said: In the past, I couldn't figure out what the management committee was all about, and the representatives couldn't represent the opinions of the masses, and the meetings only talked about welfare, becoming a welfare association. From this discussion, it can also be seen that the past preparation was very inadequate. For example, Miao Shutian, a worker on the management committee, said: I didn't even know what the management committee was supposed to do, and I was elected. After this in-depth study, the workers are full of confidence in the establishment of the management committee this time. They unanimously believe that: in the past, the leadership did not pay attention to it, and we were not very clear about the tasks of the management committee, so it ended up not being in sync, and it didn't help production much. In the future, we must make sure to put forward opinions if we have them, and do everything possible to run the factory well!
