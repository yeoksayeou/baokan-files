Combining Science with the Masses
How Shandong Province Prevented Wheat Bunt?
By our reporter Chao Qi

I. The Serious Wheat Bunt Disease

The process by which Shandong Province farmers, under the guidance of scientific technology, overcame the serious wheat bunt disease (hereinafter referred to as bunt) demonstrates that the combination of science and the masses is a new path for agricultural construction in China today.

Wheat bunt disease in Shandong Province began to affect crops four or fifty years ago, but in the past, under the reactionary rule of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, it received no attention. By 1949, it had spread to most counties in the province. For example, in the Central and Southern Shandong region, out of over 8 million mu of wheat cultivation, bunt affected one-eighth of the area, resulting in a reduction of 25 million jin. In Jiaodong and Bohai, over ten counties each experienced severe infestations, reaching 70 to 80 percent. Coupled with various natural disasters, farmers suffered severe losses in production. Because good wheat had not been harvested for decades, not only were there economic losses, but the farmers were also deeply instilled with the superstitious idea of "being at the mercy of fate." Some blamed bad luck, saying it was "destined!" Some lost their enthusiasm for production, and some burned incense and made vows.

II. Relying Solely on Book Knowledge Cannot Solve the Problem

Starting in 1946, the People's Government began to find ways to prevent and control bunt. However, relying solely on book knowledge, they called on the masses to select seeds, scald seeds, and soak seeds. Many people responded to the government's call, selecting good wheat as seeds in the fields, or exchanging for wheat seeds without bunt from relatives or in the market. Some used warm water to soak, hot water to scald, or chemical solutions to steep the seeds, but the majority of these efforts were ineffective. Sometimes the disease was alleviated, but sometimes it did not work at all. Not only did the masses lose confidence, but even the cadres dared not promote prevention and control any longer. Zhang Longshan, the old village chief of Quanzi Village, Sangzhuang District, Junan, said, "I dare not advocate scalding seeds anymore. The more I scald, the more bunt there is. I'll get blamed for it!" However, the dogmatists still refused to admit failure. In the same year, the Provincial Agricultural Training Class and the Agricultural Guidance Institute, in addition to conducting their own experiments at the Dadian Experimental Farm, also sent special personnel to Dashan to convene village meetings and universally call for clean seeds and guidance on prevention and control. They even personally worked with a few households, but when the wheat was harvested the following year, it was still a complete failure!

III. In-depth Investigation and Research Lead to Prevention Methods

Based on the experience of the 1946 failure and the widespread and serious nature of wheat bunt, the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station resolved to start with investigation and research, and then summarize and experiment. In 1947, they individually interviewed seventeen farm households with serious bunt in more than ten villages in the Luzhen District, Laopo District, Sangzhuang District, and Dashitou District of Ju County, and held seven forums with village cadres, mutual aid teams, poor peasants, and hired laborers, absorbing everyone's experience and understanding many specific situations related to bunt. After returning, they compiled these materials and found that: 1. Six households had no bunt or had little bunt in the past because they did not apply fertilizer; with the same seeds, the same planting methods, and the same land, applying soybean cake or cottonseed cake resulted in no bunt. 2. Three households used fertilizer that was not accumulated by themselves, but exchanged for fertilizer without bunt from other households. Using the same wheat seeds, the same planting methods, and even in the same plot of land, there was no bunt or very little. 3. Another three households used spreading fertilizer (Note 1) and individually planted wheat seeds, resulting in very little bunt. Using mixed fertilizer (Note 2), where fertilizer and wheat seeds were planted together, resulted in a lot of bunt. 4. Clean seeds but not clean fertilizer, or neither clean fertilizer nor clean seeds, resulted in bunt regardless of the variety, time, or place. These facts gave them great inspiration: not only can seeds transmit the disease, but also fertilizer mixed with bunt pathogens can transmit it.

In the autumn, based on the results of the analysis, experiments were conducted simultaneously in the Shizilu Farm, Dadian Farm, Ju County Farm, and in twenty-three farm households in six villages in two districts of Junan, for a total of one hundred and sixteen experiments. As a result, in these positive, negative, large, and small experiments, the conclusion was proven that bunt is transmitted through seeds and fertilizer, which is not found in any books. However, fertilizer can only transmit the disease before the seedlings emerge. From this, an effective prevention method was derived: clean seeds and clean fertilizer are essential. If the fertilizer is not clean, then the method of fertilization must be improved, i.e., applying seedling fertilizer (fertilizing after seedling emergence) or separated furrow fertilizer (separating fertilizer and seeds) spreading fertilizer instead of mixed fertilizer can reduce bunt damage.

IV. Spreading Scientific Knowledge to the Masses

Grasping typical examples and educating farmers is an important link in the universal promotion of scientific knowledge. In Shandong Province, the promotion began with Wangjiazhuang in Jiuli District, Ju County, as the focus, gradually extending to other regions. In terms of method, the experimental station sent technical cadres to the village to hold meetings with village cadres to understand the ideological situation of cadres and the masses. They motivated them to attach importance to the prevention and control of bunt ideologically. They invited farmers with more serious bunt, farmers with prestige among the masses, and farmers with production experience and enthusiasm to attend meetings, talk about the bunt situation, and help them analyze why they had bunt based on their situation, thus enlightening their thinking. Then, when holding mass meetings, they persuaded the masses through them. At the same time, various concrete facts were used to break through the masses' thinking. For example, the farmers in Wangjiazhuang did not believe that bunt was contagious at first. But after the comrades sent by the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station personally showed them the pathogens under a microscope, they believed it. After their thinking was clear, they were further asked to trace the root of the disease. The farmers in Wangjiazhuang found that the twenty-seven households that initially had bunt were all selling pancakes, because they often bought wheat with bunt pathogens and poured the wheat-washing water into the fertilizer, thus spreading the disease. At this time, everyone's thinking became clearer. They further proposed the method of clean seeds, clean fertilizer, and spreading fertilizer, and educated the masses through typical reports. When the masses understood that bunt could be prevented and controlled, they were inspired to consciously organize themselves and promote these methods. As a result, by the wheat harvest in 1949, the average bunt in the village had decreased from 52 percent in 1948 to 12 percent, changing from the heaviest in the district to the lightest.

Last autumn, the experience of Wangjiazhuang in Ju County was used for widespread promotion. In Shandong, wherever there was bunt in the past, most townships had bunt prevention committees, and every village had bunt inspection teams. They elected their own team leaders, established covenants, and guaranteed that every household would use clean seeds and clean fertilizer. The covenant in Bunan Village, Changle County, stated: "Whoever does not plant according to the methods and ways, if bunt reappears, will not be allowed to transport the wheat into the village." Then, the prevention organizations conducted in-depth inspections. During the inspection, it was found that some people with mild bunt still had a fluke mentality and did not plant according to the methods and ways. Some women's thinking was not clear, and they mixed in unclean fertilizer. Therefore, individual education was conducted. This shows that it is not easy for farmers to accept scientific methods. If one is satisfied with one or two meetings and a few covenants, without in-depth inspection and patient education, it is impossible to implement them universally and thoroughly.

When promoting in the new areas, although some people's "fate" thinking was broken, some still doubted the method, or were afraid that the seeds would swell up and not be able to sprout after washing with clean water, that the seeds would be burned to death by scalding with warm water, that the seeds would be salted to death and not sprout after selecting with salt water, that the seeds would be frozen to death without mixing with fertilizer before planting, and so on. In this case, in addition to explaining the policy and raising their awareness, they also personally experimented technically to show the farmers and dispel their concerns.

At the same time, the government tried its best to help solve many specific difficulties. For example, last year the province lent a total of 48 million jin of wheat for seeds and fertilizer, which indirectly promoted the masses to accept scientific knowledge.

In order to solve the shortage of technical cadres, the government held short-term technical training classes before the large-scale promotion, separately gathering village cadres and farmers with production experience and prestige to learn the methods of clean seeds and clean fertilizer. Or, when promoting, they first taught the village cadres and primary school teachers to accept the methods and master the technology. After the technical cadres returned, they could replace the work and ensure that it would be implemented.

This scientific method has been widely promoted, and the results this year will certainly be very good, because the villages and households that accepted this prevention method last year have greatly reduced bunt.

V. Lessons Learned:

(1) Under the leadership of the government, agricultural scientists must go deep into the countryside, investigate and study specific materials, and absorb the farmers' rich production experience in order to enrich scientific knowledge, and then promote it to the farmers. Relying solely on book knowledge is not enough. Similarly, farmers must accept the guidance of scientific knowledge in order to improve technology.

(2) After obtaining effective prevention methods, the government must patiently educate the farmers with concrete facts in order to easily break their "fate" thinking and promote scientific knowledge.

Note 1: Spreading the fertilizer first, covering it with a layer of soil, and then sowing the seeds, so that the seeds and fertilizer are separated, is called spreading fertilizer.

Note 2: In Shandong in the past, when sowing wheat seeds, the seeds and fertilizer were placed together in the "planter" and sown together, which is called mixed fertilizer.

　　科学与群众结合
    山东省是怎样防治小麦腥乌麦的？
    本报记者  超祺
    一、严重的小麦腥乌麦病害
    山东省农民在科学技术的指导下战胜了严重的小麦腥乌麦病害（简称乌麦，下同）这个过程说明了科学与农民群众的结合，是今天中国农业建设的新途径。
    山东省小麦患腥乌麦病害远在四、五十年前就开始了的，但过去在封建主义及官僚资本主义的反动统治下，没有得到任何注意；到一九四九年已经遍及全省大部县份。如鲁中南区种麦面积八百余万亩，乌麦面积占八分之一，减产二千五百万斤；胶东、渤海各有十余县严重的都达百分之七十到八十。加以各种灾荒的为害，农民的生产受了严重的损失。由于十几年以至几十年打不着好麦子，除了经济上的损失以外，还给农民深深地种下了“听天由命”的迷信思想。有的怨命运不好，说是“命该的！”有的失去了对生产的热忱，有的烧香许愿。
            二、单靠书本知识不能解决问题
    一九四六年起，人民政府就开始设法防治乌麦。但只根据书本上的知识，号召群众选种，烫种和浸种。不少群众响应了政府的号召，把在地里选好的麦子做种，或到亲戚家或到市集上去换没有乌麦的麦种，也有的用温水浸，用热水烫，用药水泡，结果大多数是无效的。有的偶而病害减轻，有的却并不生效。不只群众失掉了信心，就连干部也不敢再号召防治了。莒南桑庄区圈子村多年的老村长张隆善说：“我再不敢提倡烫种了，越烫越多，可打够自己的嘴吧了！”但是教条主义者仍不承认失败。当年省农训班和农业指导所，除在大店试验场自己试验外，再派专人到大山前去召开村民会，普遍号召净种。指导防除，并亲自搞了几户，到次年收麦时检查，仍是完全失败！
            三、深入调查研究得出防治办法
    省立农业实验所，根据四六年的失败经验，又见到腥乌麦为害的普遍与严重，遂下决心从调查研究着手，以后再总结，试验。四七年总共在莒南的路镇区、涝坡区、桑庄区、莒县的大石头区等十余村庄中，个别访问了十七家腥乌麦严重的农户，并召开了村干、变工组、贫雇农等座谈会七次，吸收了大家的经验，了解了许多有关乌麦的具体情况。回来后把这些材料整理起来，发现：一、有六户过去曾因不上粪而没有乌麦，或是乌麦少；同样的种子，同样的种法，同样的地，有的上豆饼，棉子饼也没有乌麦。二、有三家曾经不用自己积的粪，换了别人家没有乌麦的粪，也是用相同的麦种，相同的种法，甚至在同一块地里，也没有乌麦，或者很少。三、另有三家是用铺粪（注一），单独耩麦种，乌麦就很少。用耩粪（注二），粪和麦种一起耩上的，乌麦就很多。四、净种不净粪，或者粪和种都不净的不论何品种、何时、何地都发生乌麦。这些事实给他们很大的启示：不仅种子可以传染，并且混有乌麦病菌的肥料也可以传染。
    在秋天，依据分析的结果，同时在十字路农场、大店农场、莒县农场、以及莒南的两个区六个村的二十三家农家中，作了一百一十六次试验。结果，在这些正面的、反面的、大的、小的试验中，得出结论证明：乌麦传染的途径是种子和肥料，这是任何书本都没有的。但肥料的传染只有在未出苗时才有可能。由此得出防治的有效办法：净种并必须净肥。粪如不净，则必须改良施肥方法即以苗粪（出苗后上粪）或隔犁粪（粪和种子隔离）铺粪来代替耩粪方可减少乌麦为害。
            四、推广科学知识到群众中去
    抓住典型，教育农民，是普遍推广科学知识的重要环节。山东省在推广时，在步骤上，最初是以莒县九里区王家庄为重点的逐渐推及其他地区。在方法上当时实验所派技术干部亲到该村召开村干部会议，了解干部及群众的思想情况。提起他们在思想上重视防治乌麦。并邀请乌麦较重的农民，在群众中有威信的农民，和在生产上有经验又积极的农民开会，谈谈乌麦情况，根据他们的情况帮助他们分析为什么会有乌麦？启发其思想。然后召开群众大会的时候，通过他们来说服群众。同时用各种具体事实来打通群众的思想。如王家庄的农民，起初都不相信乌麦是传染的。但经省立农业实验所派去的同志亲自用显微镜观察病菌给他们看后，才相信了。思想打通后，进一步要求大家追病根。王家庄的农民追病根时得出：原来最初长乌麦的二十七家都是卖大饼的，因为时常买有乌麦病菌的麦子回来，把洗麦水倒在粪里，于是才传染的。这时大家的思想都比较明确了。就进一步提出净种净肥及上铺粪的方法，通过典型的报告，教育群众。群众明了乌麦可以防治的时候，就启发他们自觉地组织起来，并把这些办法推广下去，结果：到一九四九年麦收时，该村已由一九四八年平均乌麦占百分之五十二，降低到百分之十二，从全区以该村为最重，变为最轻。
    去秋，根据莒县王家庄的经验进行普遍的推广。在山东，凡是过去有乌麦的地方，大部每乡都有防乌委员会，每村都有防乌检查小组。自己选举组长，订立公约，保证每家都净种净粪。昌乐县埠南头村在公约上写着：谁不按方式方法种，如果再生乌麦就不准运入村来。以后就通过防乌组织深入检查工作。在检查时发现有些患乌麦轻的仍存有侥幸心理，不按方式方法种，有的女人思想打不通，掺用不净的粪。于是就进行个别教育。这说明农民接受科学方法是不容易的。如果满足于一二个会议，几条公约，不深入检查和耐心教育，是不能普遍地深入地贯彻下去的。
    在新区推广时，部分群众的“天命”思想虽然打通了，但有的还怀疑这个方法，或则怕清水洗种后，种子胀大了出不了耩，温水烫种怕烧死种子，盐水选种怕咸死种子不生芽，下种没粪拌怕冻死种子等等顾虑。在这种情况下，除通过说明政策，提高其认识外，并在技术上亲自试验给农民看，解除了顾虑。
    同时，对于许多具体的困难，政府亦尽量帮助解决，如去年全省贷种贷肥共达四千八百万斤小麦。也间接地促进群众接受科学知识。
    为了解决技术干部的不足，在大量推广前，政府曾办理短期技术训练班，分别召集各村干部，和有生产经验的、有威信的农民来学习净种净肥的方法。或者在进行推广时，先教会村干部，小学教员接受方法，掌握技术。在技术干部回来后，他们能够代替工作，保证贯彻下去。
    这个科学的方法已经普遍推广了，今年结果一定会很好，因为去年接受了这种防治办法的村户都已大大减少了乌麦。
            五、经验教训：
    （一）在政府领导下农业科学工作者必须深入农村，调查研究具体的材料，吸收农民丰富的生产经验，才能丰富科学知识，然后推广到农民中去。单纯依靠书本知识是不够的。同样，农民必须接受科学知识的指导，才能提高技术。
    （二）得到有效的防治方法后，政府必须用具体的事实，来耐心教育农民，才易打破其“天意”思想，推广科学知识。
    注一：先把肥料铺上，覆上一层土，然后播种，使种子与肥料分开，叫做铺粪。
    注二：山东过去播麦种，将种子和肥料一起放在“耩”内，一起播下，叫做耩粪。
