Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The US government is intensifying its exploitation of the Philippines as a transfer station for providing military aid to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan. Since the so-called "triangular meeting" between US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, Philippine President Quirino, and the Kuomintang bandit gang's "ambassador" to the Philippines, Chen Zhi-ping, in December of last year, large quantities of American-made weapons have begun to be shipped to Taiwan via the Philippines. At the end of February, one hundred American-supplied tanks and one hundred military trucks were shipped from the US to the Philippines for transfer to Taiwan. Recently, another four hundred and twenty-six tanks are scheduled to be shipped from the Philippines to Taiwan. According to a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong on the 25th, citing news from Taipei, the Kuomintang remnants are currently negotiating barter trade with the Philippine government, exchanging tea, paper, and other items for Philippine military supplies.

In addition, during this period, the US, Philippines, and Chiang Kai-shek's forces also implemented the "exchange of intelligence" stipulated in the triangular meeting. On March 11th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang dispatched a "police administration inspection group" from Taiwan to the Philippines. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Manila on the 9th, the purpose of this trip was to "coordinate the anti-communist measures of the Philippines and Taiwan." The dispatch also stated: "Qualified instructors, including some from the US military, will impart the latest intelligence and counter-intelligence techniques to Taiwan."

　　美帝加紧利用菲律宾
    作援助台湾匪转运站
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国政府正加紧利用菲律宾作为以军火援助台湾国民党残匪的转运站。从去年十二月间美国驻菲大使柯温、菲律宾总统季里诺及国民党匪帮驻菲“大使”陈质平间举行了所谓“三角会议”后，大批的美造武器即开始经由菲律宾运往台湾。二月末，美国援匪坦克及军用卡车各一百辆由美运菲转运台湾。最近又将有四百二十六辆坦克由菲运台。据路透社香港二十五日电引台北消息称，国民党残匪最近正与菲律宾政府商洽易货贸易，残匪将以茶、纸等换取菲律宾的军需品。
    此外，在这一个时期中，美、菲、蒋三方还执行了三角会议中规定的“交换情报”工作。三月十一日，蒋介石匪帮派出一个“警政考察团”由台飞菲。据法新社马尼拉九日电，该团此行的目的是“使菲律宾与台湾反共措施相互配合”。该电又说：“有资格的教官，包括一些由美国军队来的教官，将把最新的情报与反情报的技术告诉台湾。”
