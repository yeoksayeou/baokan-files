　　How to Charge for Telephone Disconnection
    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau answers Mr. Gao Rushan's question:
    Our Tongshun Grain Store originally installed telephone number 4-1077. On March 22, 1946, we paid an additional 15,000 yuan in legal tender as a security deposit (i.e., installation fee). Recently, due to our poor business performance, we are unable to afford the telephone bill, and decided to have the telephone disconnected. We wrote to the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau on March 18, asking them to send someone to disconnect it. On the 22nd, telecommunications staff came to disconnect the phone and left a "Disconnection Settlement Notice." On the morning of the 27th, we took the notice and the security deposit receipt to the Telecommunications Bureau for settlement. As a result, after deducting the refundable security deposit of 78,750 yuan, we had to pay the Bureau an additional phone bill of over 130,000 yuan. We asked the responsible comrade why we had to pay so much money. The answer was that it was the phone bill for the entire month of March. Because we only brought 100,000 yuan, we were unable to settle the account at that time. We have the following opinions on this matter:
    (1) We should not be responsible for telephone charges after the phone was disconnected on the 22nd.
    (2) Before our telephone was disconnected, it became out of order due to the impact of a storm. As a result, the Bureau even refunded us the phone charges for the period of the outage. How thoughtful this method is for users! Charging telephone fees after the phone has been disconnected, does this contradict the above method?
    (3) If we don't want the security deposit, should we still pay the outstanding phone bill?

Answer:
    (1) After receiving the user's disconnection notice, this Bureau immediately sends staff to disconnect the phone. If it cannot be removed immediately for any reason, the call will be stopped, the lease terminated, and the number canceled seven days after the letter arrives. If the cancellation date is on or after the 16th, the rental fee will be calculated for the entire month. If the user can notify the disconnection before the 8th of each month, only half a month's rental fee will be charged. The store notified on March 18th and disconnected on the 22nd, so the full month's rental fee for March should be paid.
    (2) This Bureau should maintain the smooth operation of the user's telephone. If the line is interrupted for more than three days and it is not due to the user's negligence, the rental fee will not be charged during the interruption period. This does not contradict the previous situation.
    (3) If the user does not claim the refunded security deposit, it is their own abandonment of their due rights. If the outstanding phone bill owed to this Bureau is not fully covered by the security deposit, this Bureau will still have to recover the remaining amount.

　　电话拆机如何收费
    北京电信局答高如山君问：
    我们通顺粮店原装设四、一○七七号电话一部，在一九四六年三月二十二日补交过一次一万五千元法币的保证金（即押机费）。近因我们营业不振，对电话费无力担负，决定将电话机拆除，便在三月十八日写信给北京电信局，请他们派人来拆。二十二日电信局就派工作同志来将话机拆去，并留下“拆机结账通知单”一张，二十七日上午我们拿了通知单及押机费收据至电信局结算，结果除去应退押机费七八七五○元外，尚得再缴局方话费十三万余。我们便问负责同志为什么要缴这许多钱，据答是三月份全月的话费。因为我们只带去十万元钱，所以当时未能结算。对这件事，我们有下列意见：
    （一）在二十二日拆机后的电话费，不应再让我们担负。
    （二）在我们电话机未拆除前，电话曾有一度受了暴风雨的影响而失灵，结果局方尚且将失灵期间的话费退给我们，这办法对用户是多么周到呀！电话机拆掉后还要收电话费，是否与上边的办法互相矛盾呢？
    （三）假如押机费我们不要了，所欠之话费是否应当缴纳？
    内三区马市大街十二号
    通顺粮店  高如山答：
    （一）本局接到用户拆机通知，立即派工拆机，如因故不能立即撤除，在信到后七日即停话止租并销号，销号日期在十六日或十六日以后者其租费概按全月计算。如用户能在每月八日前通知拆机，只收半月租费，该店在三月十八日通知，二十二日拆机，三月份自当照缴全月租费。
    （二）本局对用户话机，应维持灵通，如阻断不通在三日以上而非由于用户疏忽所致者，在阻断期内不再收租费，与前项情形并不矛盾。
    （三）用户不领退还之押机费，系自己放弃应得之权益，所欠本局话费由押费冲转后若有不足时，本局仍须追缴。
