　　Introduction to the Work Experience of Zhuoxian County Health Experimental Zone
　　Health Department of the Central Ministry of Health

　　I. Overview of Zhuoxian County

　　Zhuoxian County is located in central Hebei Province, about seventy kilometers directly south of the capital. The county is divided into eleven districts (Chengguan District and ten rural districts); Chengguan is divided into fourteen streets. The rural districts have a total of 379 administrative villages. The total population of the county is 266,796 (14,903 in the city and 251,893 in the countryside). It was liberated around the same time as Beijing. In the summer of 1949, some rural districts suffered from floods, with an average yield reduction of 20% to 40%. However, compared with the entire region, it is still one of the counties with a lighter disaster situation. There is one normal school (with an attached primary school), one middle school, and four county-run complete primary schools in the city; the villages have a total of 321 primary schools (303 regular primary schools and 18 complete primary schools).

　　In the past, except for some areas of the Eighth District, which were guerrilla areas, and the Third District, which was a recovery area, most of the other areas had been subjected to long-term rule and oppression by the enemy and puppets. As a result, in the early days of liberation, the masses still had doubts and concerns, and enemy agents also used feudal superstitious Daoist sects (such as Mahayana Buddhism, Yiguandao, Shengxiandao, and Zhengongdao) to carry out sabotage activities. Some of the masses still harbored the idea that the world would change again.

　　Most of the county and district cadres joined the work after 1945, and their quality was low; as a result, the village administration of a few villages was still controlled by the old Baojia system.

　　The county has a pharmacy (one traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and two Western medicine practitioners), with beds mainly for treating cadres' illnesses (now an outpatient clinic has been added). Initially, there was no health organization in the administration, and general health matters were handled by the Civil Affairs Section. There are a total of 573 doctors in the county (454 Chinese medicine practitioners, 67 Western medicine practitioners, and 52 others), and there are about 300 pharmacies. The Medical Association was only recently established. The masses' feedback on doctors is that their medicines are of poor quality and high price, and their skills are mediocre. Therefore, when the masses are sick, they often resort to "picking and pinching" (Note 1) for minor illnesses, and for difficult diseases (such as difficult labor, umbilical cord wind...), they either seek "folk remedies" and "secret methods" or believe in fate or pray to gods and Buddhas. Therefore, when we first arrived in Zhuoxian County, the activities of witches were occasionally heard of in individual villages, which, of course, is related to the cultural and economic level of the masses.

　　In the spring of 1949, measles and smallpox were slightly prevalent. During the summer and autumn, malaria and dysentery were also discovered, but because the mortality rate was not high, they did not attract people's attention. According to outpatient records, Kala-azar is also occasionally discovered. In addition, due to poor water quality, there is endemic "goiter" (Note 2) near the Eighth District.

　　As for the mortality rate of women and infants in the rural areas, according to a survey of 10,370 women who had given birth, among the 46,320 infants born, 18,322 died before the age of five, accounting for 39.7% of the infants born, of which 6,273 died of umbilical cord wind, accounting for 13.6% of the infants born and 56% of the total infant deaths. The incidence of puerperal fever (Note 3) accounts for about 16.9% of the number of births, with one person suffering three times.

　　II. The Beginning and End of Work

　　Before the end of August 1949, the Health Department of the North China People's Government decided to organize a rural health experimental zone in the newly liberated areas near Beijing in order to implement health work and create a mass movement. It was designated to be planned and carried out by the Anti-epidemic and Medical Team. After consultation with the Health Department of Hebei Province, and through the Baoding Prefecture Commissioner's Office and the Zhuoxian County People's Government, the entire team left Beijing for Zhuoxian at the end of September of the same year, and initially completed this work on February 8, 1950. It lasted four and a half months.

　　1. Personnel Allocation - Most of the personnel of the team were comrades who had newly joined after the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin; only a few comrades who came from the old liberated areas and had worked in Pingshan accounted for a small number. The level of work experience and technical theory was very uneven. Therefore, both at the beginning and during the course of the work, it was repeatedly emphasized that they should learn from each other with an open mind, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and a working committee was established to promote democratic centralized leadership. In addition to the chairman and vice-chairman, the committee also had two groups: a secretary and a technical group. Depending on the work situation, several working teams and a theatrical propaganda team were flexibly formed.

　　Initially, there were a total of 54 comrades. When the plague occurred in Chahar, 27 people were transferred at one time, and finally the number increased to 103 (including 11 comrades sent by Hebei Province), including 56 men and 47 women.

　　2. Work Steps - The work was originally planned to be carried out in three phases:

　　The first phase of work - Focused on absorbing the experience of experimental work, starting from the beginning of October 1949, with a planned time limit of two months. The Eighth District was first used as a key area. First, propaganda and investigation were carried out, and then the work was planned and carried out in depth. The Third District combined production and disaster relief to implement mobile medical services. Then, based on the experience of the Eighth District, the work was started simultaneously with the Seventh District, and a relatively complete set of working methods was further and systematically organized, and the teaching content, methods, and methods were unified. Although some comrades were transferred due to the plague in Chahar during this phase of work, we completed the planned tasks on schedule under the slogan of "completing the task even with fewer people." During this period, we also spent half a month conducting collective reporting and learning.

　　The second phase of work - Using the experience already absorbed, we carried out universal promotion, focusing on how to combine the central work of the local area - land reform - first completing the Ninth and Tenth Districts, and then proceeding simultaneously with the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts. In this way, all ten rural districts were completed. The original time limit was three months, but with the hard work of the comrades, it only took two months, and in addition, the preliminary inspection of ten rural districts and the organization, training, and investigation of the Chengguan District were also completed.

　　The third phase of work - Originally planned to be carried out in one month for general inspection and general closing work. In addition to the preliminary inspection of the ten rural districts, the inspection work of the Chengguan District and the general closing and consolidation work remain to be done in the future.

　　3. Work Overview:

　　Propaganda: In order to eliminate the feudal superstition of the masses, explain the government's concern for the people and our tasks, in the past four and a half months, in addition to the constant collective and individual speeches, the use of blackboards, slogans, rooftop broadcasting, Yangko dance, and the gaps in diagnosis and treatment for propaganda, we also held five health exhibitions in the city and various central villages to introduce infant and maternal health and the symptoms and prevention of general statutory infectious diseases, with a total of 9,750 visitors. Finally, we also specially made a set of propaganda paintings on infectious diseases and donated them to the county cultural and educational center for long-term exhibition. In addition, we also performed 26 plays that combined production, eliminated superstition, mobilized the masses to organize, and promoted new methods of midwifery, with a total of 53,300 viewers. In the play "Aunt Wang Er's Child Rearing", when the audience saw the simplicity and effectiveness of the new midwifery method, many people whose children had been cut off by umbilical cord wind all their lives were moved to tears, on the one hand, thanking the government for its in-depth publicity and education, and on the other hand, recalling their own pain, and vowed to widely promote the new midwifery method.

　　Organization: In addition to the establishment of the County Health Committee, health committees were established in a total of 378 villages. Villages with too small a population to organize a health committee and the fourteen streets of the Chengguan District also universally selected full-time health workers. As for the district health committees, except for the Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts, which had already been established, the establishment of the remaining districts was temporarily delayed due to the impending change of district boundaries. The tasks were taken over by the district head or the district health assistant. Health organizations were universally established in all 328 primary and secondary schools in the county. The Medical Association of the county (including Chengguan) and nine rural districts (only a group was established in the Second District due to the impending change of district boundaries) was established and consolidated.

　　Training: In terms of training health personnel, we trained 784 full-time health workers in the county, teaching them the symptoms and common knowledge of infectious diseases, the importance of environmental hygiene and personal hygiene, and the methods of implementation, and unified the meeting reporting system. (According to the inspection results of ten rural districts, 33% of the villages have carried out reporting, 82.8% of the villages have carried out large-scale cleaning, 74% of the villages have carried out sanitary inspections, and about 70% of the villages have carried out various sanitary publicity). When measles occurred in Daliu Village and Diaowo Village in the First District, they were able to report to the higher authorities and enthusiastically assisted us and the county government in forming an anti-epidemic team to conduct investigation and disposal. In addition, together with these full-time health workers and 600 primary school teachers, 300 winter school teachers, and 120 primary school students, a total of about 1,804 people mostly learned the theory of preventive inoculation and the practice of vaccination, and through them, the autumn vaccination was carried out. As of now, according to extremely incomplete statistics, 24,309 people have been vaccinated, and the pox rate is about 66%. In checking the results of the pox, not only was the pox rate of the elderly higher, but there were also four cases of people who had had smallpox who also had a positive reaction, two of which were severe reactions, and the pox year was only three years. This is very worthy of attention. A total of 1,880 people were organized in the county to learn new midwifery methods, including 755 old midwives who were improved, with an average of one new midwifery worker per 29 households or 141 people. After the training, three inspections were carried out successively, and a total of 1,191 newborns had 964 (80.9% of the newborns) delivered by the new method. Except for 89 (24% of the newborns) who died from other diseases, none died from umbilical cord wind. According to the last general inspection of 800 newborns in ten rural districts, the results showed that 612 times the new method was completely used (76.5% of the newborns), and the infant umbilical cord wind mortality rate was also reduced from 13.6% to 4.8%; there was only one death from puerperal fever. In addition, we also combined the trained midwives to deliver eight difficult births, two or three normal births, one other premature birth, two miscarriages, and one dry birth, which not only established prestige among the masses, but also educated the intern midwives.

　　Treatment: A total of 6,884 people were treated (Note 4) (4,091 initial visits, 2,409 return visits, and 384 initial and return visits unclear). People who were relieved of pain universally gratefully said: "The people's government led by Chairman Mao is truly concerned about us ordinary people!" "The anti-epidemic team's art (technology) is really good! They tell us everything, and we must do it well."

　　Laboratory Tests: In addition to assisting in the diagnosis and examination of sputum, urine, blood, secretions, etc. in 676 cases, 1,215 stool tests were performed, and 993 cases of Ascaris eggs were found, accounting for 81.7% of the cases examined. 183 cases of hemoglobin determination had a total average percentage of 72.1%, 158 cases of red blood cell calculation had a total average number of 4,220,000 per cubic millimeter, and 158 cases of white blood cell calculation had an average number of 8,101 per cubic millimeter.

　　Investigation: We investigated goiter in five typical villages, as well as the environmental sanitation of Chengguan District and 231 schools and the personal hygiene of 1,089 primary schools, the condition of 850 wells, the death of children born to 10,645 women in 72 villages and one street, and the menstrual and marriage age of 5,807 women. In the investigation of menstruation, we found six individual cases of women who never had menstruation but were able to give birth, one of whom, both her mother and daughter had the same situation, which is worthy of study whether it is hereditary. In addition, there are also the general situation of the prevalence of statutory infectious diseases in the past year and the population of the county... Most of these investigations were carried out by our team's comrades, but a small part was carried out by trained health workers, district and village cadres, women's federation cadres, primary school teachers, midwives..., which shows that if we can lead them well, they can achieve certain results.

　　Conclusion: Now the county government has a health section, and most districts have added health assistants. In addition to the full-time health workers in the villages, a complete system has been established administratively in the county, districts, and villages. In order to thoroughly strengthen and consolidate this work, to absorb the experience of experimental work more deeply, we believe that some comrades should be sent to assist the county government in strengthening leadership and completing the general inspection and closing work for a longer period of time.

　　III. Several Main Gains and Experiences

　　Based on this experimental work, we have initially realized the following points:

　　First, it once again affirms that health work must be a mass movement.

　　The oppression of feudal and reactionary forces for thousands of years, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and cultural backwardness, needless to say. But without actual in-depth investigation, it is impossible to understand. Therefore, this work particularly emphasized comprehensive or typical investigations. As a result, we realized the seriousness of maternal and infant mortality and the difficulty of medical treatment. Especially in the outpatient clinic, laboratory tests, and investigation, we know the large number of gastrointestinal and parasitic diseases, which shows that these are diseases that should not occur due to the lack of health knowledge and habits. Especially for medical personnel who have just come from the city to the countryside, although they all have a high degree of work enthusiasm, most of them have a strong "pure medical view." However, from the actual investigation and understanding, they saw the great harm of umbilical cord wind, the poor patients everywhere, the doctors extorting the patients' families, and the superstitious and backward situation. They knew that these were the sufferings left by the reactionary rule. In the land reform, they more truly saw the ugly acts of landlords and reactionaries spreading rumors, sabotaging, and oppressing, as well as the hardship and greatness of the peasants, which improved their political awareness. From the enthusiasm for the revolution, they turned to the real enthusiasm built on political understanding and thinking. They knew that to complete such an arduous task, we can only implement the basic policy of prevention first and medical treatment as a supplement; rely on all organizational forces, mobilize the masses, unite and transform Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, transform and educate midwives, and establish various health organizations based on the existing cultural and economic level through the voluntary participation of the masses, and widely carry out health campaigns from shallow to deep, from near to far. In order to complete this task, we must learn the hard and simple style of work, win unity with labor, and use the method of calculating small accounts to get through the thinking of cadres and the masses who despise health work from the losses caused by a single infectious disease and a single patient affecting the central work, and combine the central work with actual examples to carry out various forms (especially exhibitions and dramas) of patient and extensive propaganda targeting the masses' superstitious and unscientific thinking. Seize the opportunity and mobilize the active elements with high prestige (especially intellectuals) to play a leading role. For example, in the Eighth District, helping farmers with "autumn harvest" opened the door to pioneering work. After the closing of each exhibition, the folks (especially the elderly women) said: "We only know today what it is like to raise a child" (referring to the position of the fetus in the mother's body). Artificial respiration saved the pseudo-death (Note 5), and everywhere it was said: "After all, it is the people's government that taught us this wonderful method!" This established the prestige of the masses. For example, two times, we used the county's primary school teacher training to get through their thinking, taught 900 people the method of vaccination, and arranged for them to return to the village to publicize and implement vaccination, thus laying the foundation for the county's autumn vaccination.

　　Second, the organization of village health committees:

　　According to the experience of various places, village health organizations can be divided into three categories: (1) only administrative health workers, (2) only mass organizations of health committees, and (3) the director of the health committee is concurrently held by the health worker. In our actual work, the first category lacks the cooperation of the masses, the second category lacks dedicated personnel to be responsible for supervision and inspection, and the third category is that the prestige of the health worker among the masses is not as high as that of the responsible cadres of the village, and it is more difficult to launch work. Therefore, we tried to select full-time health workers (one male and one female) administratively and establish mass health committees, and the director of the committee was concurrently held by the main cadres of the village (village head, chairman of the farmers' representative meeting, village branch secretary), and the health workers were the natural members of the committee. The division of labor of the committee: propaganda and education, anti-epidemic medical treatment, cleaning and hygiene, and maternal and child health four groups, one to two people in each group, and the whole committee is set up with five to nine people depending on the size of the village. In order to further strengthen the organization and facilitate leadership, every ten households are organized into a health group, which is guided by the health committee and specifically implements tasks. The whole committee reports to the district every ten days. The county health section, district health assistant, and village full-time health worker form a system administratively, and the county, district, and village health committees are a system of mass organizations, and the former also participate in the health committees at all levels as natural members. Such close combination is bound to be beneficial to promoting work by giving greater play to the strength of the masses.

　　As for the candidates for each group, the propaganda and education is mostly concurrently held by the education committee or teachers, the anti-epidemic medical group is filled by doctors or people who are enthusiastic about health work, the cleaning group is concurrently held by the youth league or the head of the squadron, and the maternal and child group is concurrently held by the person in charge of the women's federation (of course, male and female full-time health workers must also concurrently hold a group), and the health group leader is selected by each group. In order to achieve certain results in a short period of time, we do not carry out universal education, but focus on the full-time health workers who are mainly responsible for promoting the work and the members of the anti-epidemic medical group, teaching them general health knowledge, infectious disease diagnosis and treatment, and methods of promoting work. For other members, we only explain the tasks they are responsible for and introduce typical work examples.

　　From the inspection results, most of the full-time health workers in the villages are able to specifically grasp the work and report on time. Among the groups, propaganda and education has the greatest effect, because the members of the propaganda and education group are mostly concurrently held by teachers. They have a certain level of culture and have a strong mass - students - on the one hand, carrying out the health work of their own schools, and on the other hand, mobilizing primary school students to participate in village health activities, such as using New Year's entertainment activities, participating in health propaganda programs, organizing Yangko teams, and cooperating with the cleaning group to do inspection work, which can easily create a climax of health campaign. Therefore, we say that if we mobilize teachers and students to improve the health organization of schools, it is an important part of carrying out rural health. The cleaning group, especially in the approach to the Spring Festival, combined the habits of residents to carry out a large-scale cleaning, and cooperated with the next year's large-scale production to mobilize early transport of fertilizer to the ground, thus achieving the sorting out of manure piles. This shows that if we can combine the habits and interests of the masses to promote health work, it is a most effective way. The maternal and child group has been supported by the masses because of the new method of midwifery, and there is no lack of content in promoting the work. It is only that some people in the anti-epidemic medical group think that it has not played a role. We think this is only a matter of time. If we can often introduce knowledge of disease prevention, simple treatment methods, strengthen leadership, give specific work content, and introduce typical work experience in the future.

　　Third, the harvest of midwifery training class:

　　In the new district, to run a rural midwifery training class, in order to win the participation of old midwives and new activists, we must target anti-feudalism and anti-superstition, expose the suffering suffered by women (especially the suffering in childbirth), explain the death that should not occur from puerperal fever, umbilical cord wind, and false death, and carry out mobilization to improve their political awareness, so that they truly recognize the feudal oppression and link their own interests to gain their unexpected enthusiasm, and they will soon approach us. Therefore, if we can patiently and humbly carry out mobilization and education, stir up their enthusiasm, pay special attention to the old midwives, use their prestige to call on other women, and at the same time they accept the curriculum quickly; in future work, they can also help the progress of new midwives. The combination of new and old guarantees the health of mothers and children from childbirth and lays the foundation for future maternal and child health work. The inspection results have confirmed this fact. However, from the fact that the midwives who have been mobilized, because of the improvement of their awareness, have further demanded the thorough liberation and improvement of the organization, running midwifery training classes is also of certain significance for mobilizing women to overthrow feudalism. For example, before the midwifery training class was held in Xialian Village in the Tenth District, most of the women were afraid of coming forward, and at most three or two old ladies reluctantly attended each meeting. After the training class was held, the women demanded to improve politically, and more than one-third of the women participated in each meeting, especially at the grievance meeting, more than one-half of the women participated, and the women who were able to boldly express their grievances were all students of the midwifery training class. County Chief Sun once said: "These are all the achievements of the midwifery training class."

　　Fourth, the experience of uniting and transforming local doctors:

　　In order to solve the realistic lack of medical personnel and equipment in rural areas and lay the foundation for anti-epidemic work, on the one hand, we must determine the local medical and health construction work, train a large number of ordinary medical cadres, go to the countryside for mobile diagnosis and treatment, and promote urban hospitals and pharmacies to face the masses. On the other hand, we must transform and unite the existing Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, so that they can turn from the old society's thinking of "profit" and "infighting" to serving the broad masses of the working people. In fact, they (especially Chinese medicine practitioners) all hope to know more about pathology and the usage of new drugs, so we complied with their wishes and introduced practically needed things and knowledge in technology (such as the usage of special drugs, the etiology and bacterial morphology of infectious diseases), and explained according to real cases, which greatly aroused their interest. In addition, we also told them about the conditions that doctors in the new society should have, criticized the "conservative" and "selfish" bad habits of the old society, promoted the establishment of medical associations, put forward the necessity of combining politics and technology at the meeting, and arranged certain tasks. If we can strictly supervise and inspect this year, we can gradually change their past concepts and turn to serving the people.

　　The medical associations in the districts of Zhuoxian County, except for the Second District, which only established a group, have been established in other districts. They can all hold meetings on time to study and discuss technical and political issues. In the Seventh District, they voluntarily reduced the price of medicines and declined the banquets of patients' families, saying: "It is good to save a little unnecessary expenses and add some nutrients to the patients." They also offered all their family heirlooms - more than 200 secret recipes - and collected them into a book and distributed them to each district for reference. The medical association in the Second District voluntarily formulated a covenant: "In the event of an infectious disease, report and deal with it in time to ensure that the infectious disease does not spread from this district." This shows that using politics and technology in combination to unite and transform local doctors through the medical association is bound to be an effective way.

　　This experimental work has inspired us to carry out local health work, we must adapt to the rural economic and cultural level, and properly combine central work and other cultural and educational work. In-depth propaganda and mobilization of local doctors, education of old-fashioned midwives and other activists, improve their political awareness, give them certain tasks, carry out emulation of meritorious service and model movements, create a health campaign, and at the same time, the peasants who have undergone land reform are enthusiastic about production and naturally require good health. In fact, if this problem is not solved, it will seriously affect production. Therefore, health work is by no means a purely technical problem, and should be regarded as an urgent problem in democratic construction.

　　Note: 1. Picking and pinching: Picking: using a needle to prick, such as picking "wool boils", pinching: using hands or copper coins to pinch and scrape to the extent that subcutaneous blood overflows, which is a folk method of treating diseases.

　　Note: 2. Goiter: A large tumor grows in front of the neck.

　　Note: 3. Puerperal fever: The vaginal area is infected with germs, and the fever is very high within two days after delivery, which is a disease that should not occur.

　　Note: 4. Person-times: A person sees a doctor once.

　　Note: 5. Newborns, after delivery, will not cry or breathe. If they are given stimulation or artificial respiration, they will cry.

　　介绍涿县卫生实验区的工作经验
    中央卫生部保健处
    一、涿县概况
    涿县位于河北中部，距首都正南约七十公里。全县共分十一个区（城关区及十个乡区）；城关共分十四个街。乡区共有三七九个行政村。全县人口共二六六七九六人（城一四九○三人，乡二五一八九三人）。与北京先后解放。一九四九年夏一部乡区曾被水灾，平均歉收百分之二十至四十。但以全专区比较，仍属灾情较轻之一县。城内有师范一（设有附小）、中学一、县立完小四；各乡村共有小学三二一所（普小三○三所，完小一八所）。
    过去除八区一部系游击区、三区系恢复区外，其余绝大部分地区均曾经受敌伪长久的统治压迫，以致解放初期，群众仍存怀疑顾虑，敌特也曾利用封建迷信道门（大佛教、一贯道、圣贤道、正公道等）进行破坏活动。部分群众尚存变天思想。
    县区干部多系四五年后参加工作的，质量较低；以致少数村政权仍操于旧保甲手中。
    县里有一药社（中医一、西医二），设有病床，以医治干部疾病为主（现已添设门诊）。行政上初期无卫生组织，一般卫生事宜由民政科负责。全县共有医生五七三人（中四五四人，西六七人，其他五二人），医药店铺约有三百所，医联会组织最近始普遍建立。群众对医生反映，大都药劣价高，技术平平。因此群众有病，轻者多仰求挑捏（注一），疑难病症（如难产脐风……）不求助于“土方”“秘法”，即相信宿命或叩求神佛。因此当我们初到涿县时，个别的村庄巫婆活动，时有所闻，当然这和群众的文化、经济水平有关系。
    一九四九年春，麻疹天花小有流行，夏秋之交，疟疾、赤痢亦曾有发现，但因死亡不大，均未引起人们注意。根据门诊记录，可以知道黑热病亦时有发现。此外八区附近因水质不良，有“甲状腺肿”（注二）地方病。
    至于乡区妇婴死亡情况，根据调查一○三七○名经产妇所生的四六三二○个婴儿中，五岁以下死亡一八三二二名，占出生婴儿的百分之三九·七，其中脐风死亡六二七三名，占出生婴儿百分之一三·六，占婴儿死亡总数的百分之五六。产褥热（注三）的发病率，约占生产次数的百分之一六·九，其中有一人患三次者。
    二、工作始末
    一九四九年八月底前，华北人民政府卫生部，为了贯彻卫生工作，必须造成群众性运动起见，特决定在北京附近的新解放区，举办一个农村卫生实验区，指定由防疫医疗大队负责筹划进行，当即商得河北省卫生厅的同意，通过保定专署与涿县人民政府洽妥后，全队于同年九月末离京赴涿，于一九五○年二月八日初步完成了这工作。历时四月有半。
    １、人员配备——该队人员，大部是在京津解放后新参加的同志；来自老解放区而在平山作过工作的同志仅占少数，工作经验和技术理论的水平是十分参差不齐的，因此无论在工作的开始和进行期间，反复强调彼此应互相虚心学习，采长补短，并成立了工作委员会，以求发扬民主集中领导。委员会除设正副主委外，下设秘书、技术两组，视工作情况，机动的组成若干工作分队和演剧宣传队。
    初期共有同志五四人。察北鼠疫发生，一度调走二七人，最后增加至一○三人（其中包括河北省所派之十一名同志）计男性五六人，女性四七人。
    ２、工作步骤——工作进行原定分三期进行：
    第一期工作——以吸取实验工作的经验为主，自一九四九年十月初开始，原定期限两个月，首先以八区为重点区，先宣传调查，然后计划和深入的开展工作。三区则结合生产救灾，施行巡回诊疗，然后以八区经验与七区同时开始，进一步合理而系统的整理出一套较完备的工作方法，并统一了教学内容，方式与方法。这期工作虽因察北发生鼠疫，调走一部分同志，但我们在“人少也要完成任务”的口号下，如期完成了预定计划。其间我们并曾用了半个月的时间，进行了集体汇报和学习。
    第二期工作——以已吸取的经验，进行普遍的推广，并着重研究如何结合地方中心工作——土改——首先完成九、十两区，继之一、二、四、五、六区同时并进。这样十个乡区全部完成，原定期限三个月，但同志们努力工作之下，只用了两个月，并且还另外完成了十个乡区的初步检查和城关区的组织、训练、调查工作。
    第三期工作——原定以一个月进行总检查及作总的结束工作。除十个乡区已作了初步检查外，城关区的检查工作和总的结束与巩固工作，则有待于今后的努力。
    ３  工作概况：
    宣传  为了破除群众的封建迷信，说明政府对人民的关怀和我们的任务，四个半月来我们除掉经常不断的以集体和个别的讲话，利用黑板报、标语、屋顶广播、秧歌及诊疗的空隙进行宣传外，我们并在城及各中心村开过五次卫生展览会，以介绍婴妇卫生和一般法定传染病的症状和防治法，共获有观众九七五○人，最后我们还特制了一套传染病的宣传画赠给了县文化教育馆，长期展览。另外我们还演出了结合生产，破除迷信，发动群众组织和宣传新法接生的话剧二六次，共拥有观众五三、三○○人，在演《王二嫂养娃娃》一剧中当观众看到新法接生的简单有效时，许多一生为脐风断绝了子女的人们，一方面感激政府关心的深入宣教，一方面回忆己身的痛苦，常常的被感动得流下泪来，发誓要一定把新法接生普遍宣传起来。
    组织  组织工作除成立了县卫生委员会外，共建立了三七八个村的卫生委员会，其因人口过少没有组织卫生委员会的村子和城关区的十四个街，也都普遍的选出了专任卫生员。至于区的卫生委员会除四、七、八区已成立外，其余各区，则因区界即将变更，暂缓成立，其任务则由区长或区卫生助理负责掌握。全县三二八所中小学校也都普遍成立了卫生组织。成立并巩固了县（包括城关）和九个乡区（二区因区界即将变动仅成立了小组）的医联会。
    训练  培养卫生人员方面：我们训练了全县七八四名专任卫生员，教给他们传染病的症状和预防常识，环境卫生个人卫生的重要性及实施方法，并确定划一了会议汇报制度。（根据十个乡区检查结果已有百分之三三的村子进行了汇报，百分之八二·八村子做了大扫除，百分之七四的村子做过卫生检查，百分之七十左右的村子做过各种卫生宣传）。在一区大柳村、刁窝村发生麻疹时，他们能向上级报告，并且很热诚的协助我们和县府组成的防疫组进行调查和处置，另外连同这些专任卫生员以及小学教员六○○人，冬校教员三○○人和小学校学生一二○人共约一八○四人，大多学习了预防注射理论和种痘的实习，并通过他们展开了秋季种痘，截至目前止，根据极不完全的统计，种痘二四三○九人，出痘率约为百分之六十六，在检查发痘成绩中，不仅老年人的发痘率较高，且有患过天花的四例也发生了阳性反应，其中二例是重反应，出痘年限不过三年，这是非常值得注意的事。全县组织了一八八○人学习新法接生，其中改进旧接产婆七五五人，平均每二九户一四一人即有一新法接生员。训练后先后曾做过三次检查，共计一一九一个初生儿已有九六四名（占出生婴儿的百分之八○·九）是用新法接生，除有八九名（占出生婴儿的百分之二十四）为其他疾病死亡，无一名脐风患者。根据最末一次十个乡区普遍检查八○○个新生儿，结果有六一二次完全使用新法（占出生婴儿的百分之七六·五）婴儿的脐风死率也从百分之一三·六降低至百分之四·八；只有一名产褥热的死亡。此外我们还结合了受训的接产员共接难产八次，平产二三次，其他早产一，流产二，干产一，不仅在群众中建立了威信，并且还教育了实习的接生员。
    治疗  治疗方面共治疗六八八四人次（注四）（初诊四○九一人，复诊二四○九人次，初复诊不明三八四人次）。被解除痛苦的人们普遍的感激说：“毛主席领导的人民政府才是真正关心咱们老百姓呢！”“防疫队的艺儿（技术）真好！他们告诉咱们一切，一定要好好做去”。
    化验  化验方面除协助诊断检查痰、尿、血、分泌物等六七六例外，并做了一二一五例的粪便检查，发现回虫卵九九三例占检查例的百分之八一·七，一八三例血色素检定总平均百分率为百分之七二·一，一五八例红血球的计算总平均数每立方粍四、二二○、○○○和一五八例白血球计算平均数每一立方粍为八、一○一。
    调查  调查方面我们调查了五个典型村的甲状腺肿，还有城关区和二三一个学校环境卫生和一○八九个小学的个人卫生，八五○个水井状况，七二个村和一个街一○六四五名经产妇所生儿童死亡状况，五八○七个妇女月经与结婚年龄情形。在调查月经情况中，发现有六名妇女终身没有月经但能生育的个别例子，其中一名，其母与女均系同样情况，是否遗传值得研究。此外还有一年来法定传染病流行概况和全县居民人口情形……这些调查大部分是由我队同志进行的，但也有一小部分则是由受过训的卫生员区村干部、妇联干部、小学教员、接产员……等所进行的；说明了我们如能好好领导他（她）们，是能够做出一定成绩的。
    结尾  现在县府已设有卫生科，各区大都增设了卫生助理，加上村的专任卫生员，县区村在行政上虽已建立了完整的系统，为了彻底加强和巩固这一工作，以更深刻吸取实验工作的经验。我们认为还应调派一部分同志前往，以一较长的时间协助县府加强领导，完成总的检查与结束工作。
    三、几点主要的收获与经验
    根据这次实验工作我们初步体会到以下几点问题：
    一、再一次肯定了卫生工作必须是群众性运动。
    几千年封建和反动势力的压迫，农村经济破产和文化落后，自不待言。但是非经实际的深入调查，无从明了，所以在这次工作中特别强调了全面或典型的调查；因之认识了妇婴死亡的严重和医疗的困难。尤其是在门诊、化验、调查中知道肠胃和寄生虫疾患数字的庞大，启示了这都是因为缺乏卫生常识和习惯所造成的不应得的疾病。尤其对初从城市下乡的医务人员，虽然都曾抱着高度的工作热诚，多半存在着浓厚的“单纯医疗观点”，但他们从实际调查和了解中，看到四六风为害之巨，到处存在的贫苦病人，医生勒索患家，以及迷信落后的情形，知道这都是反动统治所遗下的疾苦。在土改当中，更真切的看到地主和反动分子造谣破坏压迫的丑行，以及农民们的艰苦和伟大，提高了他们的政治觉悟，由对革命的幻想热诚而转建在政治认识和思想上的真实热诚，知道要想完成这样艰巨的任务，只有贯彻预防为主医疗为辅的基本方针；依靠一切组织力量，发动群众，团结改造中西医生，改造教育接生员，并通过群众的自愿，建立起各种卫生组织，根据现有的文化经济水平，由浅而深、由近而远的广泛展开卫生运动。为了完成这一任务，必须学习艰苦朴实的作风，以劳动争取团结，用算小帐办法，从一次传染病及一个病人所影响中心工作的损失，打通干群轻视卫生工作的思想，并结合中心工作以实际例子针对群众迷信和不科学的思想进行各种方式（尤其展览和演剧），耐心而广泛的宣传，掌握机会，发动威信较高的积极分子（特别是知识分子）起带头模范作用，像在八区帮助农民“秋收”，打开了开辟工作的大门。每次展览会闭幕后，老乡们（尤其是老年妇女）都说：“我们今天才知道养娃娃是那么一回事”（指胎儿在母体的位置）。人工呼吸，救治了假死（注五），到处都传说：“到底是人民政府，才教给我们这妙法儿呢！”这样树立了群众威信。又如两次利用全县小学教员集训打通了他们的思想，教会九百人种痘方法，布置他们回村宣传施种，因而打下了全县秋季种痘的基础。
    二、村卫生委员会的组织：
    根据各地的经验，村卫生组织，可分三类：（一）只有行政的卫生员，（二）只有群众性组织的卫生委员会，（三）卫生委员会主任委员由卫生员兼任。我们在实际工作当中，以第一类缺乏群众性的配合，第二类缺乏专人负责督促检查，第三类则因卫生员在群众中的威信，不如村负责干部高，发动工作较难，因此我们试行了在行政上选出村专任卫生员（男女各一）而成立群众性的卫生委员会，主任委员则由村主要干部（村长、农代会主任、村支书）兼任，卫生员则为该会的当然委员。委员会的分工：宣传教育、防疫医疗、清洁卫生、妇婴保健四组，每组一——二人，全会视村之大小设五——九人。为求进一步的加强组织和便于领导，每十户编成一卫生小组，受卫生委员会指导，具体执行任务，全会每十日向区汇报。县卫生科、区卫生助理、村专任卫生员，在行政上成一系统，县区村卫生委员会，则是群众性组织的一系，而前者又都参加了各级卫生委员会为当然委员。这样密切结合，发挥更大的群众力量，对推行工作上是必然有利的。
    至于各组的人选，宣教多由教委或教员兼任，防疫医疗组由医生或热心卫生工作的人充任，清洁组由青年团或中队部负责人兼任，妇婴组则由妇联会负责人兼任（当然男女专任卫生员也须兼任一组），卫生小组长则由各组自行选出。为了在短时间要收到一定效果，我们不进行普遍教育，只重点的对主要负责推行工作的专任卫生员和担任防疫医疗组的委员，教给一般卫生常识传染病诊断和处置及推行工作的方法，对其他各委员，则只说明担当的任务和介绍典型的工作例子。
    从检查结果来看，各村专任卫生员，大都能够具体掌握工作，按时汇报。各组中以宣教发挥效果最大，这是因为宣教组的委员，多由教员兼任，他们在文化上具有一定水准，而且拥有有力的群众——学生——一面开展自校的卫生工作，一面发动小学生参加村卫生活动，像利用新年文娱活动，参加卫生宣传节目，举办秧歌队，配合清洁组作检查工作，很容易造成卫生运动的高潮。所以我们说如果发动教员学生健全学校卫生组织，是开展农村卫生的重要一环。清洁组特别是在将近春节中结合居民习惯，举行大扫除，配合翌年的大生产，发动提前运肥到地头，因而作到整理粪堆。说明了如能结合群众习俗和利益推行卫生工作是一件最有效的办法。妇婴组则因为新法接生，业已受到群众的拥护，在推行工作上也不乏内容。只是防疫医疗组有人认为尚没起到作用，我们想这只是时间问题，此后如能经常介绍以预防疾病的知识，简易治疗法，加强领导，赋予具体工作内容和介绍典型工作经验。
    三、接产训练班的收获：
    在新区开办农村接产训练班，我们为了争取旧接产婆和新的积极分子参加，必须针对反封建反迷信，揭穿妇女所受的痛苦（尤其是在生育上的痛苦），说明产褥热脐风假死不应该的死亡，进行启发动员，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们真正认识封建的压迫联系己身的利害会获得他们意想之外的热诚，很快的便会和我们接近，因此我们如能耐心而虚心的进行动员教育，鼓起他们的热情，特别注意旧接产婆，利用他们的威信，号召其他妇女，同时他们对课程接受也快；在未来的工作中也可以帮助新接产员的进步，新旧结合从生育中保证了产妇和小孩健康，打下了今后妇婴卫生工作基础，在检查结果中，已肯定了这一事实。但从被发动后的接产员们，因为觉悟提高，进而要求彻底解放健全组织的事实来看，开办接产训练班对发动妇女打倒封建，也是具有一定意义的，像十区下南良村没开办接产训练前，妇女大都害怕出头露面，每次会议最多不过三两老太太勉强出席。训练班开办后，妇女们都要求在政治上提高，每会都有三分之一以上妇女参加，尤其是诉苦大会时竟有二分之一以上的妇女参加，能够大胆诉苦的妇女，都是接产训练班的学员，孙县长曾说：“这都是接产训练班的成绩。”
    四、团结改造地方医生的经验：
    为了解决农村现实缺乏医药人员设备，并打下防疫工作的基础，一方面必须确定地方医疗卫生建设工作，培养大批普通医务干部，下乡巡回诊治，促使城镇医院药社面向群众，另一面我们必须对现有的中西医生加以改造团结，使之从旧社会的“营利”“倾轧”思想，转向为广大劳动人民服务，事实上他们（尤其中医）都希望多知道一些病理和新药用法，所以我们便顺应他们的希望，在技术上介绍实际需要的东西、知识（如特效药的用法，传染病的病源和病菌形态），并根据实在病例，进行讲解，这样便大大引起他们的兴趣。另外更给他们讲些新社会医生应有的条件，批判旧社会的“保守”“自私”恶习，促进医联会的成立，在会上提出政治与技术结合的必要，并布置了一定的工作，今年若能严格督促检查，便能逐渐使他们改变以往观念而转向为人民服务。
    涿县各区的医联会除二区仅成立小组外，其他各区均已成立，他们都能按期开会，研究讨论有关技术与政治的问题。在七区他们自动的减低了药价，谢绝了病家宴会，说：“省一点不必要的花消，给病人多添些滋养品也是好的。”并且还把他们自己的传家宝——秘方二百余种一一都供献出来，搜集成册，分送各区参考。二区的医联会自动的订立公约“遇有传染病及时报告处理，保证不使传染病从本区蔓延起来。”说明了通过医联会，用政治与技术结合，团结改造地方医生是一定会收效的办法。
    这一实验工作，启示了我们开展地方卫生工作，必须适应农村经济文化水平，好好结合中心工作及其他文教工作。深入宣传发动地方医生，教育旧式产婆及其他积极分子，提高他们政治觉悟，赋以一定的任务，展开立功竞赛模范运动，造成卫生运动，同时经过土改后的农民，热情生产自然要求身体健康，事实上这一问题如不解决，真会严重的影响生产，因此卫生工作决非单纯的技术问题，应看做民主建设中的一个迫切问题。
    注：一、挑捏，挑：用针刺挑如挑“羊毛疔”，捏：用手或用铜钱捏刮，以皮下溢血为度，这是一种老百姓的治病方法。
    二、甲状腺肿：脖子前面，生长了大的瘤子。
    三、产褥热：生产阴部受了病菌传染，产后两天内发烧很高，这是不应该发生的病。
    四、人次：一个人看病一次。
    五、初生儿，娩出后，不会哭、不会呼吸，给以刺激，或人工呼吸法，就会哭了。
