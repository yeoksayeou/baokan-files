Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Beijing's state-owned enterprises and government agencies are supporting the production of private industry by commissioning processing and placing orders. This has played a significant role in overcoming the blindness of private industrial production and effectively guiding private production.

	In the past year, the Grain Company commissioned the flour industry to process more than 956,000 bags of flour, accounting for approximately 45.91% of the industry's total output last year. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company purchased and exchanged over 195,000 bolts of various types of cloth from the weaving and dyeing industry, accounting for approximately 54.01% of the industry's total output last year. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also commissioned the machine dyeing industry to dye more than 125,000 bolts of cloth. In addition, the Department Store has also supported more than 1,700 factories and workshops through methods such as exchange, commissioned processing, acquisition, exclusive sales, and consignment sales. The Ministry of Agriculture's Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Railways, the North China Electric Power Company, and many other public factories and mines have also placed a large number of orders with private industry and commissioned private industry for processing production.

	In January, February, and March of this year, the aforementioned processing and ordering volumes have increased significantly. For example, the Grain Company commissioned the flour industry to process more than 533,000 bags of flour, accounting for 55.76% of the total processing volume for the entire year of last year. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's yarn-for-cloth exchange alone amounted to more than 71,000 bolts, accounting for 36.25% of the total number of cloth purchased and exchanged throughout last year.

	This method of supporting private industry through commissioned processing and ordering not only solves the difficulties of some private factories having no work to do and no sales outlets, but also guides the production of private industry through processing and ordering, assists private industry in overcoming the blindness of production, and improves the quality of products. In addition, it also solves the difficulties in capital turnover for some private factories. Through processing and ordering, state-owned enterprises can control the supply and regulation of major market commodities (such as grain and cloth), which plays a significant role in stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods.

	Due to the lack of unified leadership and meticulous planning, and insufficient inspection and supervision, some problems have also occurred in commissioned processing and ordering. For example, some individual state-owned enterprises and government agencies, when commissioning processing and ordering, did not have correct cost calculations, nor did they understand the production capacity and product quality of the commissioned factories, resulting in only selecting factories that "can do it" or "offer cheaper prices" during bidding. In order to win the bid, manufacturers superficially reduced profits to the lowest limit, but then cut corners or used inferior goods to replace good ones during the process, resulting in losses to the government. There are also individual departments that did not directly entrust factories to undertake the work, but rather contracted it to intermediary merchants who then passed it on layer by layer. The factories that actually did the work received little profit, while the intermediary factories did not do any work but reaped huge profits. In addition, in terms of calculating costs and processing profits, some state-owned enterprise departments are inconsistent with each other. For example, last year the profits for commissioned processing and ordering by the Ministry of Railways were higher than those of the Ministry of Agriculture's Water Conservancy Promotion Society. Some factories disregarded the orders from the Water Conservancy Promotion Society and rushed to undertake the orders from the Ministry of Railways.

	Therefore, according to Beijing's experience: when state-owned enterprise departments and government agencies commission private industry to process or place orders with them, they must first have unified leadership, or the various processing and ordering departments should strengthen contact and cooperate with the Municipal Industrial Bureau and relevant trade associations to make more accurate cost calculations and stipulate appropriate profits according to the actual situation; at the same time, processing or ordering contracts should be strictly implemented, and through education and inspection of private business owners, ensure that the specifications and quality of finished products meet the standards.

　　北京市国营企业和政府机关
    委托私营工业加工定货日增
    对扶植和领导私营工业起了很大作用
    【新华社二十六日讯】北京市国营企业和政府机关用委托加工和定货的办法扶植私营工业生产，在克服私营工业生产的盲目性和有效地进行对私营生产的领导方面，起了很大的作用。
    去年一年中，粮食公司委托面粉业加工生产面粉九十五万六千余袋，约占该业去年总产量百分之四十五点九一。花纱布公司曾向织染业收购与交换各种布十九万五千余匹，约占该业去年总产量百分之五十四点零一。花纱布公司并曾委托机器染布业染布十二万五千余匹。此外，百货公司亦以交换、委托加工、收购、包销、托售等方式扶植了一千七百多个工厂和作坊。中央人民政府农业部水利推进社、铁道部、华北电业公司，以及很多公营厂矿向私营工业定货和委托私营工业加工生产的数量也很多。
    今年一、二、三月份中，上述加工和定货的数量有了显著的增加。如粮食公司委托面粉业加工生产面粉即达五十三万三千余袋，为去年全年委托加工数的百分之五十五点七六。花纱布公司以纱换布一项即有七万一千多匹，为去年全年收购与交换布匹数量的百分之三十六点二五。
    这种用委托加工和定货等方式扶植私营工业的办法，既解决了一部分私营工厂无活可做和销路的困难，而且，通过加工定货，又指导了私营工业的生产，协助私营工业克服了生产的盲目性，提高了产品的质量，此外，还解决了一部分私营工厂资金周转的困难。通过加工和定货，国营企业能够掌握对市场主要物资（如粮、布）的供应调剂，在稳定物价、保障民生上面作用极大。
    由于缺乏统一的领导和缜密的计划，检查督促不够严格等原因，在委托加工和定货中也曾发生过一些问题。如有个别的国营企业和政府机关，在委托加工和定货时，既没有正确的成本计算，也不了解委托工厂的生产能力和产品的质量，以致在招标时只选择“能作”或“价钱便宜”的工厂承做。厂商为了中标，表面上将利润减至最低限度，而在承做中偷工减料，或用劣货顶替，结果使政府受到损失。也有个别部门没有直接委托工厂承做，由包揽厂商承包后，层层转手，实际承做的工厂利润小，包揽工厂不做活反而坐获重利。此外，在计算成本和加工利润方面，有些国营企业部门彼此不一致，如去年铁道部委托加工和定货的利润较农业部水利推进社高，有些工厂便不顾接受水利推进社的定货而抢着承作铁道部的定货。
    因此根据北京市的经验：国营企业部门和政府机关委托私营工业加工或向其定货时，首先须要有统一的领导，或者是由各加工定货部门加强联系，并与市政府工业局和有关的同业公会配合，作出比较精确的成本计算，按照实际情况规定适当的利润；同时，应严格实行加工或定货合同，通过对私营业主的教育和检查，保证成品规格质量合乎标准。
