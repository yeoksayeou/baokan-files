Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: The strike by Japanese electrical workers demanding wage increases is intensifying. According to Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo: Since March 9th, the electrical workers' union has been conducting increasingly large-scale, nationwide wave-like blackouts. The fourth wave-like blackout strike ended on the 28th, and a further expanded fifth wave-like blackout strike began on the 29th. This strike includes blackouts for transportation agencies and coal mines. The schedule is as follows: on the 29th, government agencies will be blacked out day and night, and from March 31st to April 3rd, transportation agencies will be blacked out.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: MacArthur and the Yoshida government are colluding to brutally suppress the strike by Japanese coal miners demanding wage increases. According to Reuters and Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo: The Japan Coal Miners' Union Federation began a scheduled week-long national coal mine general strike on the 25th. After two days, Emiss, the chief of the Labor Section of MacArthur Headquarters, hurriedly summoned Masuda Kakichi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Yoshida government, and Labor Minister Suzuki Masabumi on the morning of the 27th to discuss countermeasures. That afternoon, Emiss and the Yoshida Cabinet successively ordered the Central Labor Relations Board to intervene in the matter and implement "compulsory mediation" to suppress the strike of 310,000 people. Emiss claimed that this measure was "based on the intention of the Supreme Commander (referring to MacArthur)." Under the pressure of MacArthur and the Yoshida government, the Japan Coal Miners' Union Federation ordered the cessation of the general strike from the 29th.
