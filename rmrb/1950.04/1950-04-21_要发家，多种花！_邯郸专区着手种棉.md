　　"To Get Rich, Plant More Cotton!"
    邯郸 Prefecture Starts Planting Cotton
    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in Hebei's 邯郸 Prefecture are successively sowing cotton. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office has also dispatched 500 cadres to the countryside to mobilize and launch a large-scale cotton planting campaign. The entire prefecture had already prepared for cotton planting. At the beginning of spring, when formulating production plans, they vigorously promoted production policies and cotton price policies, dispelling the masses' concerns about low cotton prices and enabling them to realize that planting cotton benefits both themselves and the country. After propaganda and mobilization, family meetings, and the formulation of production plans, the cotton planting plan was implemented down to each household. Economic departments throughout the prefecture also provided assistance for cotton planting, providing farmers with high-quality cotton seeds and fertilizers in a planned and focused manner. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to exchange and borrow good cotton seeds.邱县 also launched a "three comparison" movement among the masses: comparing planting, exchanging seeds, and selecting seeds. In particular, the comparison of planting played a significant role in promoting superior varieties.
    Due to the experience of planting late last year and encountering drought, which required great effort, the masses generally want to plant early while the soil is still moist. In addition, with the leadership's call, cotton planting had already begun before Qingming. 邯郸 has already planted 20 hectares of cotton, and some villages in 肥乡 are currently planting. The 邯郸 Prefectural Committee issued an instruction on April 6th to carry out a concentrated sowing effort, emphasizing the importance of planting early rather than late, as the planting season waits for no one. It also vigorously organized mutual aid to solve the difficulties of the masses in lacking livestock, manpower, farm tools, and seeds. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Committee also dispatched more than 500 cadres from government agencies and students from the Party School, organizing a concentrated sowing team, which went to key cotton-planting counties on the 9th to help mobilize the masses to sow.

　　“要发家，多种花！”
    邯郸专区着手种棉
    【本报讯】河北邯郸专区农民相继播种棉花。该专署各机关并抽出五百名干部下乡发动开展大规模种棉运动。全区种棉早有准备，春初订生产计划时，即大力宣传生产政策、棉价政策，打破群众怕棉花价低的顾虑，使群众认识到：种棉对自己对国家都有利。经过宣传动员、开家庭会、订生产计划，把种棉计划贯彻到户。全区各经济部门也对种棉进行了帮助，有计划有重点地贷给群众优良棉种及肥料。同时发动群众互换互借好的棉种。邱县还开展了群众比种、换种、选种的三比运动。特别是比种，对推广优良品种作用很大。
    群众由于去年种晚了，又遇天旱，费劲很大的经验，一般都愿趁垧早种，再加领导号召，清明前种棉即已开始。邯郸已种棉二十顷，肥乡有些村庄正在种。邯郸地委于本月六日曾发出突击播种指示，强调指出要赶早不赶晚，播种季节不等人。并大力组织互助，以解决群众缺乏牲畜、人力、农具、种籽的困难。专署、地委并抽出机关干部、党校学员五百余人，组织突击播种队，九日分赴各植棉重点县帮助发动群众播种。
