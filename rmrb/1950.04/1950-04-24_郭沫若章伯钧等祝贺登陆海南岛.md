　　Guo Moruo, Zhang Bojun, and Others Congratulate the Landing on Hainan Island
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in the capital continue to express their congratulations on the People's Liberation Army's successful landing on Hainan Island. Non-Party democratic personage Guo Moruo said: The successful landing on Hainan Island is a prelude to the full liberation of Hainan Island and also a prelude to the full liberation of Taiwan Island. It can be seen that in the face of the victorious pace of the People's Liberation Army, any natural or man-made obstacles cannot be resisted. Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, pointed out in his speech: The liberation of Hainan Island has not only military significance, but also great economic and political value. He said: Equally worthy of our admiration is the Hainan Island people's armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party, which fought under extremely difficult conditions; especially in the recent stage, they advanced wave upon wave, fought bravely, and created more favorable conditions for the main force to cross the sea for combat. This achievement will always be admired by the people of the whole country. The person in charge of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League in Beijing said: The landing and liberation of Hainan Island will make the bandits in Taiwan tremble. At the same time, it has inspired the people of Taiwan, who will surely rise up with the spirit and action of the "February 28th" revolution to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and the Chiang bandits to fight the final and most heroic decisive battle. After hearing the news of the People's Liberation Army landing on Hainan Island, the North China General Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League held a gathering to celebrate this victory. In their telegram of thanks to the Fourth Field Army, they said: "The news of your successful landing on Hainan Island has given the people of Taiwan great excitement and encouragement: your victory indicates that the victorious landing on Taiwan is not far away."

　　郭沫若章伯钧等祝贺登陆海南岛
    【本报讯】首都各界人士继续对人民解放军胜利登陆海南岛发表谈话表示祝贺。无党派民主人士郭沫若说：海南岛的胜利登陆，是海南岛全面解放的前奏，也是台湾岛全面解放的前奏。可见在人民解放军的胜利步伐前面，任何天然的或人为的阻厄是抵挡不住的。中国农工民主党中常会主席章伯钧在谈话中指出：海南岛的解放，不仅具有军事意义，而且具有经济的和政治的绝大价值。他说：同样值得我们崇敬的是中国共产党所领导的海南岛人民武装力量，在极困难的条件下奋斗；尤其在最近的阶段上，更是前仆后继，奋勇冲杀，而为主力渡海作战创设了更有利的条件。这种功绩，将永远为全国人民所景仰。台湾民主自治同盟在京负责人说：海南岛的登陆与解放，将使台湾的匪帮为之发抖。同时也鼓舞了台湾人民，他们一定能以“二、二八”革命精神和行动，起来配合解放军和蒋匪作最后而最英勇的大决斗。台盟华北总支部在听到人民解放军登陆海南岛消息后，全体盟员举行集会庆祝这一胜利。在他们致第四野战军的谢电中说：“你们胜利登陆海南岛的消息，给我们台湾人民以极大兴奋与鼓舞：你们的胜利指明了胜利登陆台湾亦已为期不远了。”
