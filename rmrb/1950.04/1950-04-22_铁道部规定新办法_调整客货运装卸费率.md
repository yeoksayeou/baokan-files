　　Ministry of Railways Stipulates New Measures
    Adjusts Passenger and Freight Loading and Unloading Rates
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has, on April 15th, uniformly adjusted the national railway passenger and freight loading and unloading rates. Before the adjustment, the basic loading and unloading fee for ordinary goods was originally two jin of rice per ton. Due to the difference in rice prices and other necessities in various regions, the actual income of loading and unloading workers was affected. For this reason, the Ministry of Railways specifically submitted to and was approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government to change the loading and unloading fee for ordinary goods to be calculated at one "fen" per ton. Each "fen" includes three jin of coal, 1.29 jin of rice, 0.02 jin of oil, 0.18 chi of cloth, and 0.03 jin of salt. At the same time, the Ministry of Railways also stipulated that all passenger and freight loading and unloading fees should be subject to an additional 20 percent from the same date as management fees for local loading and unloading supply cooperatives.

　　铁道部规定新办法
    调整客货运装卸费率
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府铁道部已于四月十五日统一调整全国铁路客货运装卸费率。调整前普通货物每吨基本装卸费原为二斤米，因各地米价与其他生活必需品差额不同，影响了装卸工人的实际收入。为此，铁道部特呈准中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会将普通货物装卸费改按每吨一“分”计算。每“分”包括煤三斤，米一·二九斤，油○·○二斤，布○·一八尺，盐○·○三斤。同时，铁道部并规定所有客货运装卸费亦自同日起一律附加百分之二十，作为各地装卸供应社之管理费。
