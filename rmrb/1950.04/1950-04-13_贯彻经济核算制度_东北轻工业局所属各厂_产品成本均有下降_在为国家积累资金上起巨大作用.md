　　Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: According to the Northeast Daily on the 7th of this month, factories under the Northeast Light Industry Bureau have made great achievements in conservation and cost reduction by thoroughly implementing the economic accounting system. In recent years, the cost of various products has decreased. Before the Bureau's factory director conference in May last year, there was no cost accounting for various products, nor was profit calculated. It was simply a matter of asking for money on one hand and delivering goods on the other, with no concern for profit or loss. Since the conference determined that improving quality and reducing costs would be the central task for the future, and after clearing assets, determining the amount of fixed capital, establishing a budget and cost accounting system, and implementing quota management, the factories began to pay attention to economic accounting, which gradually reduced the cost of various products. To cite a few major products as examples: the cost of sulfite pulp at the Shixian Paper Mill in December last year decreased by 18.46% compared to February; the cost of newsprint decreased by 0.93% per ton. The cost of newsprint at the Andong factory decreased by 20.53% in December last year compared to April, and special paper in Jilin decreased by 1.62%. The cost of automobile tires produced by Rubber Factory No. 1 in December last year decreased by 7.73% compared to January last year, while the cost of bicycle tires at Rubber Factory No. 3 decreased by 27.7%. Rubber Factory No. 2 achieved the most prominent results, with the cost of transmission belts in December last year decreasing by 38.23% compared to May. Because the cost of various products has been reduced, it has played a significant role in accumulating funds for the country. In the three months from September to December last year alone, the factories accumulated more than 57 billion yuan (Northeast currency) for the country. The reasons for cost reduction vary from factory to factory due to different production conditions. Generally speaking, paper mills reduced costs by improving labor efficiency, reducing consumption, and improving technology; the factors for cost reduction in rubber factories were saving raw materials and improving quality. For example, the continuous reduction in the cost of Andong newsprint was due to increased production efficiency (previously it took 183 man-hours to produce one ton, which was later reduced to 64 man-hours) and reduced waste. The reason for the reduction in the cost of pulp at the Shixian Paper Mill is inseparable from the addition of a roasting furnace. In the past, sulfur was used to steam pulp, and the value of sulfur required for each ton of pulp was 13.68 million yuan. After using roasted iron sulfide, only 8.5 million yuan of medicinal materials were required. Taking Rubber Factory No. 2 as an example, in the past, many belt heads became waste products due to improper vulcanization of transmission belts. After the workers improved the vulcanization method by using ropes, not only was waste reduced, but also 30,000 more "Brae" (the unit of measurement for transmission belts) could be produced each month, reducing costs by more than 90 million yuan.
    The Bureau has not yet resolved the problem of stockpiled cash and stockpiled finished products in the implementation of the economic accounting system. According to statistics, in the six months from June to December last year, paper and rubber factories accumulated a total of 55.5 billion yuan in funds (calculated by subtracting half of the average monthly cash expenditure from the monthly cash balance as the amount of stockpiling). If calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3% for bank loans, the loss amounts to more than 1.6 billion yuan. If the stockpiled cash is invested in production, with a turnover period of 90 days and a profit rate of 20%, the monthly loss amounts to more than 3.7 billion yuan. To avoid the recurrence of such phenomena, the Bureau has implemented a daily cash inventory report (previously it was a monthly report) this year, and adopted random inspection methods to promptly understand the cash balance of each factory and appropriately use funds.

　　贯彻经济核算制度
    东北轻工业局所属各厂
    产品成本均有下降
    在为国家积累资金上起巨大作用
    【新华社十一日讯】据本月七日东北日报载：东北轻工业管理局所属各厂由于深入贯彻经济核算制度，在节约与降低成本上有很大成就，年来各种产品成本均有下降。该局在去年五月厂长会议以前，各种产品均无成本计算，亦不计算利润，反正是一手要钱，一手交货，赔赚全不过问。自该次会议确定以提高质量、降低成本为以后的中心任务，经过清理资产，确定了固定资金数目，建立了预决算与成本计算制度，以及实行定额管理后，各厂才开始注意经济核算，因之使各种产品成本逐步降低。仅举几种主要产品为例：石岘造纸厂的亚硫酸纸浆，每吨成本去年十二月份较二月份降低百分之十八点四六；每吨新闻纸成本降低百分之○·九三。安东厂新闻纸的成本，去年十二月较四月降低百分之二十点五三，吉林特种纸降低百分之一点六二。橡胶一厂去年十二月出的汽车外胎成本，较去年一月份降低百分之七点七三，橡胶三厂自行车外胎的成本，则降低百分之二十七点七。成绩最突出的橡胶二厂，去年十二月的传动带，较五月的成本降低百分之三十八点二三。正因各种产品成本降低，在为国家积累资金上起了巨大作用，仅去年九月至十二月三个月中，各厂即为国家积累资金五百七十余亿元（东北币，下同）。各厂降低成本的原因，因生产情况不同而各异。总的来说，造纸各厂是因为提高了劳动效率，减少消耗，和改进技术而降低了成本；橡胶各厂降低成本的因素，则是节约原材料与提高质量。如安东新闻纸的成本所以能续有下降，就是因为生产效率提高（过去造一吨需一百八十三工时，后降至六十四工时）和减少流失所致。石岘造纸厂纸浆成本降低的原因，则是与增设焙烧炉分不开的，过去用硫黄蒸纸浆，每吨纸浆所需硫黄价值一千三百六十八万元，改用焙烧硫化铁后只用八百五十万元药料费即可。橡胶各厂以橡胶二厂为例，该厂过去传动带因硫化不得法，很多皮带头因硫化不着而成废品，经工人改进用穿绳办法硫化后，不仅减少了浪费，每月还可多出传动带三万“布来”（传动带的计算单位），降低成本九千余万元。
    该局在贯彻经济核算制中对积压现金与积压成品现象仍未解决。据统计，在去年六月至十二月六个月中，造纸、橡胶各厂共积压资金（按照每月现金结存数减去月份平均支出现金之半数，作为积压）五百五十五亿元之巨。如按银行放款月利百分之三计算，损失额达十六亿元以上。如以积压的现金投到生产中去，按九十日为一周转期，利润率以百分之二十计算，每月损失额达三十七亿余元。为避免此类现象再度发生，该局今年已实行现金库存日报（过去是月报），并采取抽查办法，以及时了解各厂库存款额，适当运用资金。
