Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw dispatch from Polish News Agency: The Warsaw newspaper in Poland recently published a special article entitled "The Harvest of the First Quarter," summarizing the production achievements of the first quarter of this year, stating that Poland's entire industrial sector has exceeded the first quarter plan. For example, the coal mining industry exceeded the plan by 10.6 percent. The average daily coal production this year increased by 17,000 tons compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Other industries such as electricity, steel, and chemicals have also exceeded their plans. This achievement is largely attributed to the new long-term labor competition initiated by miner Makiefka.

In agriculture, it is worth noting that thorough preparations were made in terms of supplying artificial fertilizers, selected seeds, technical equipment, and traction power. The spring sowing campaign is progressing smoothly due to the increasing mechanization - with 6,500 more tractors in use than last year. At the same time, as of March 31, 802 agricultural production cooperatives have been formed.

In terms of transportation and communications, the port management plan has been completed by 113 percent; the first "Lavant" type cargo ship completely manufactured in Poland has been launched. This is a major event for our merchant fleet.

The domestic market, especially the meat market, has improved significantly. Due to the achievements of the livestock breeding campaign, the meat market has been able to remove all sales restrictions. Speculators had deliberately created chaos in the textile market, but this has been vigorously countered by the authorities, and the market is returning to normal. The socialization of trade networks has greatly expanded due to the large-scale opening of municipal retail stores. All of this made it possible to lift restrictions before Easter, when people need consumer goods the most, and to freely sell textiles, shoes, and other goods in state-owned stores and cooperative stores.

The Warsaw newspaper pointed out that it would not have been possible to successfully complete the first quarter plan without the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The expansion of Poland's trade and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic will be conducive to the realization of the great tasks of the Six-Year Plan.

### 波兰第一季生产获显著成就  工业部门已超过计划  农业机械化日趋扩大

　　波兰第一季生产获显著成就
    工业部门已超过计划  农业机械化日趋扩大
    【新华社十五日讯】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰华沙报顷发表题为《第一季的收获》的专文，总结今年第一季的生产成就称：波兰整个工业部门已超过了第一季计划，例如煤矿工业就超过了计划百分之十点六，今年每一工作日的平均产煤量，较去年第四季增加了一万七千吨。其他如电力、钢铁和化学工业，都已超过计划。这种成绩大部应归功于矿工马基夫卡所发起的新的长期劳动竞赛。
    在农业方面，值得注意的是：在供应人造肥料、选种、技术设备和拖曳力各方面进行了周密的准备，由于日益扩大的机械化——较去年多使用了六千五百架拖拉机，使得春播运动进展顺利。同时，截至三月三十一日止，已经组成了八○二个农业生产合作社。
    在运输与交通方面，海港管理计划已完成了百分之一百一十三；完全由波兰本国制造的第一艘“拉温特”式货船业已下水。这对我们的商船队来说，是一件大事。
    国内市场，特别是肉类市场，已有了显著的改进。由于牲畜饲养运动的成就，使肉类市场能够取消一切销售的限制。投机者曾故意造成纺织品市场的混乱，但是，已遭到当局的大力反击，市场正在恢复正常状态。由于大量开设了市镇零售商店，社会化贸易网已大为扩大。这一切使得在人民最需要消费品的复活节前夕，能够取消限制，可以在国营商店与合作社商店中自由出售纺织品、鞋子及其他货物。
    华沙报指出：假如没有苏联及人民民主国家的合作，就不可能胜利完成第一季计划。而波兰与苏联、人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的贸易和经济合作的扩大，将有利于实现六年计划的伟大任务。
