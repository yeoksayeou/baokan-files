　　Old Lady Han

　　The overall station work at the Chang'an Railway Station of the Longhai Railway began on March 7th. From that day on, more than 500 employees and their families participated in this work every day. In this heated and intense work, the highest work enthusiasm belonged to Old Lady Han, the seventy-year-old mother of Han Jingyu, a locomotive driver from the 704 Locomotive Factory in Chang'an. People felt infinite respect for her work enthusiasm. They said, "The success of this overall station work is a glory that belongs to Old Lady Han."

　　Old Lady Han has a strong body and a tireless work ethic. She arrived at the site every day before some of the staff and their families even arrived; until people finished their work in the morning and dispersed, she was still there picking up stones to throw into the roadbed or hoeing the soil beside the road to dig out the rotten sleepers buried in the soil. When she was really tired and hungry, she would sit on the ground to rest, chewing on the dry steamed bun she brought with her, and drinking a bowl or two of boiled water brought by her family members, and then continue working. When her daughter-in-law came to the site to call her home for breakfast or lunch, she always answered, "Eating is not as important as working. Instead of calling me every day, you should boil a few more kettles of water at home and send them here for the comrades who are working to drink." Therefore, her daughter-in-law, afraid of delaying her work, stopped calling her. ... She worked like this every day until dark, and only when she really couldn't work anymore would she brush off the dirt on her body and wearily walk home.

　　The working staff and their families all knew that she had been working continuously like this for almost a month, without ever being delayed by family affairs. On April 3rd, it was raining heavily, and all the comrades and family members working on the site had left, but she still wanted to do more work there. If Comrade Liu, who was in charge of the overall station work, hadn't persuaded her to go back, she really wouldn't have wanted to leave the site. When she left, she even complained to the sky, "It's raining, so we can't work."

　　Because of her continuous work on the site, many working comrades had gotten to know her. Sometimes, when they saw her working diligently, they would say to her, "Old Lady Han, you are so old, take a rest!" She would immediately reply, "This is the people's own railway now. We can only eat if we do a good job on the railway." Therefore, under her leadership, the staff and their families who participated in the work were all very actively working.

　　After several interviews with her, we learned that her love and responsibility for the people's railway had profound reasons. According to her, "My life has been very hard. I became a widow when my child Jingyu was thirteen or fourteen years old. From that time on, I led Han Jingyu and his sister, three people, and wandered from our old home in Jining, Shandong, to Luoyang, suffering hardships. After arriving in Luoyang, I finally managed to get Han Jingyu to seventeen years old, and by asking people for favors everywhere, I got him a job as an apprentice in the Luoyang West Yard of the Longhai Railway under the name of Ren. He worked as an apprentice for three years, and then changed to a fitter; after working as a fitter for three years, he changed his name to take the test for a fireman; this continued until 1942, when he took the test for a driver in Luoyang, and his name was already on the list. But when he went to report to the reactionary Longhai Railway Administration, they insisted that he had not passed the test and let someone else take his place. He had no choice but to continue working as a fireman."

　　Old Lady Han said here, somewhat sadly, and continued, "We worked on the Longhai Railway, without connections or power, only enduring hardships. In 1942, we moved from Luoyang to Xi'an and lived on Er Ma Road. We happened to live in the same courtyard as Qin, the inspector of the Shaanxi Provincial Government of the Kuomintang reactionary government. He looked down on us poor workers and, fearing that we would steal from him, forced the landlord to drive us away, and desperately scolded me as an old hag, an old hag. We couldn't bear it anymore, so Jingyu built a thatched house in the Yuanzi Factory. Just after we moved to the Yuanzi Factory, Li Bingxiang, the special agent chief of the pseudo-Longhai Party Department, also moved there. He saw that Han Jingyu didn't say a word, and thought he had a stubborn temper, so he always wanted to find trouble with us, and kept arguing and gossiping, trying to pin a reactionary hat on Han Jingyu, constantly shouting to 'arrest Han Jingyu, arrest Han Jingyu!' Later, with the help of many workers, we moved again, but Jingyu's sister was frightened and went mad that year, and she is still not well." She suppressed her full of grief and indignation, and sighed, "We have been eating at the Longhai Railway for twenty-eight years (Han Jingyu is already forty-four years old this year). Before liberation, our days were really not good! Now the Communist Party is supporting us workers. What else can we say but to do a good job in building the railway!"

　　Here, it reminds us that when Xi'an was liberated last year, she was the first to go to the Chang'an Machine Factory to deliver tea to the People's Liberation Army. She grasped the hand of a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and said, "Chairman Mao has come, the sky is clear, and the years of unreasonable arguments are over."

　　韩老太太
    高毅生
    这次陇海铁路长安车站整站工作，是从三月七日开始的。从那天起，每天都有五百以上的职工和职工眷属参加这一工作。在这热烈紧张的工作中，工作热情最高要算是长安机厂七○四机车司机韩景玉七十多岁的老母亲，韩老太太。人们对她的工作热情都感到无限的钦敬。说：“这次整站工作搞的好。光荣要属于韩老太太。”
    韩老太太有健壮的身体，不止不休的工作精神。她每天到现场工作的时候，一些工作人员和眷属还没有到；直到上午人家又下工散去了，她还在那里检石子往道心撩或是场镢刨道旁的土，掘出埋在土里腐朽的枕木。待工作得实在累了，饿了，她才坐在地上休息休息，嚼嚼自己带去的干馍，渴了喝上一碗两碗眷属送去的开水，就又继续干活。她儿媳到现场叫她回家吃早饭或千饭时，她总是这样答：“吃饭不如工作要紧，天天叫我，你不如在家多烧上几壶开水送来这里给干活的同志们喝。”因此她儿媳怕耽误她的工作，也不去叫她了。………她这样天天工作到天黑，真的不能工作了，才扑扑身上沾的泥土很疲倦走回家去。
    工作职工眷属都知道她这样继续不停工作，快一个月了，从没有一次因家事耽误。在四月三号那天，天紧落着雨，在现场上的工作同志和眷属都走完了，她还想在那里多干点工作。要不是负责整站的刘同志劝她回去，她真不舍得离开现场。临走时还埋怨着天：“下雨了，就不能工作了。”
    由于她不停的在现场工作，很多工作同志已认识了她。有时看到她殷勤的在工作，就对她说：“韩老太太你这样大的年纪了，休息休息吧！”接着她就立即回答说：“这是人民自己的铁路了，我们搞好铁路才有饭吃。”因此，参加工作的职工眷属在她带头下，都很积极地工作。
    经过我们几次的访问，知道她对人民铁路这样爱护与负责是有着深远的原因的。据她说：“俺命很苦，俺孩子景玉十三四岁的时候，我就守了寡。从那时，我领着韩景玉和他姐姐三个人离开山东济宁老家，受苦受难的流浪到洛阳。到了洛阳，好不容易的把韩景玉拉把到十七岁，东托人，西托人的把他送到陇海铁路洛阳西场顶了一个姓任的名字当了学徒。他干了三年学徒，又改做了镶配匠；干了三年的镶配匠，才改了现在的名字考了司炉；这样一直到一九四二年，在洛阳考了一次司机，榜上已经有他的名字了。但到反动派的陇海铁路管理局去报到，硬说他没有考上，叫别人顶上了那个缺，不得已他只好再干司炉了。”
    韩老太太说到这里，有些伤感地又说下去：“我们在陇海铁路上干，没门子，没势力，只有苦熬。一九四二年，我们由洛阳搬到西安住在二马路，正巧碰上与国民党反动政府的陕西省政府秦督察员住在一个院里。他看不起我们穷工人，怕偷他，硬逼着房东赶走俺，还拚命骂我老家伙、老家伙的。实在受不了，俺景玉才到元字工房棚了一间草房。刚刚搬到元字工房去住，偏偏伪陇海党部的特务头子李炳祥也搬到那里，看俺韩景玉不哼不哈，认为脾气硬，老是想找我们的事，又加吵着说说道道，就想给俺韩景玉硬扣不是好工人的反动帽子，成天吵着要“抓走韩景玉，抓走韩景玉！”后来经许多工友们帮忙，说合，我们才给搬了家，可是景玉的姐，在那年就被吓疯癫了，到现在病还没好。”她抑压着满腔的悲愤，长吁了一口气：“我们在陇海路吃了二十八年的饭了（今年韩景玉已四十四岁），在解放前，我们日子真不是好过的啊！现在共产党给我们工人们撑了腰，不好好的把铁路搞好，还说啥啊！”
    在这里使我们回想起在去年西安刚解放时，她第一个到长安机厂给解放军送茶，她曾抓紧了解放军战士的手说：“毛主席来了，天晴了，不说理的年头过去了。”
