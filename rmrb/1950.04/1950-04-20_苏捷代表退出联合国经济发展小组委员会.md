Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 18th: The Economic Development Sub-Committee of the Economic and Employment Commission under the UN Economic and Social Council held its fourth meeting on April 17th. After the majority of the sub-committee members, led by the US representative, refused to examine the Soviet proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the sub-committee, the Soviet representative withdrew from the meeting. The majority of members used the excuse that the sub-committee had "no right" to deal with this issue. Before leaving the meeting, the Soviet representative pointed out that the Soviet Union would consider any resolution passed at a meeting attended by representatives of the Kuomintang clique to be illegal and would not recognize such a resolution.
	The Czechoslovak representative also made a similar statement and then withdrew from the meeting.

　　苏捷代表退出联合国经济发展小组委员会
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：联合国经社理事会所属经济及就业委员会下的经济发展小组委员会，于四月十七日举行第四次会议。在以美国代表为首的小组委员会多数委员拒绝审查苏联所提将国民党集团的代表开除出小组委员会的提案后，苏联代表即退出会场。多数委员这样做的借口是小组委员会“无权”处理这个问题。苏联代表在退出会场前指出：在有国民党集团代表参加的会议上通过的任何决议，苏联都将认为是不合法的，并将不承认这种决议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表亦发表同样声明，并随即退出会场。
