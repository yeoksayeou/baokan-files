    The educational process in the Dzerzhinsky Commune was based on the combination of learning and productive labor. According to Makarenko, the founder of the Commune, the purpose of education here was to cultivate conscious citizens, Communist Youth League members, and Bolsheviks of the Soviet state, organizers and commanders, and to cultivate people who are good at struggle and construction, good at living and loving life.

    When Makarenko began to organize children's productive labor in the Dzerzhinsky Commune, he had theoretically well-considered educational experience in this area, which had been accumulated in the Gorky Labor Colony.

    In the Dzerzhinsky Commune, a production base was established, which was constantly developed and improved in connection with the educational tasks arranged by Makarenko. The forms of productive labor of the students also changed accordingly; the cultural and technical level of the teenagers and young people engaged in production was improved; the realization of the principle of combining teaching and productive labor also changed and became more complex; and the educational value of the production base was also improved.

    All students in the Commune were absorbed into productive life.

    In the factory, the education of labor discipline was given special attention. Commune members must consciously and accurately perform their tasks, unconditionally and quickly complete the orders of their team leaders, carefully treat the property of the factory, complete certain product standards in accordance with the production plan, and participate in socialist competitions and shock brigades.

    Production learning in the factory was conducted according to the method of upgrading skill levels, with a short period of work training before upgrading. Skilled workers were trained directly in the factory, participating in the execution of the production plan. After acquiring solid work habits at that level for a certain period of time, the Commune members were transferred to another level, with higher skill requirements. The time required for production learning and the creation of skilled workers was two and a half to four years, depending on the profession.

    Organizing production learning according to the principle of upgrading skill levels has great educational significance.

    This system is a constant and effective stimulus to continuously improve the production technical proficiency of Commune members.

    At each stage of learning, the recent prospects of his progress are revealed to the student, as well as new possibilities for exercising his creativity in production.

    Makarenko had the educational thought of the "path of perspective," "on these paths there is tomorrow's joy." The organization of production learning by means of upgrading skill levels was a practical manifestation of this educational thought.

    It should be pointed out that the form of applying skill level transfers in the electrical tool manufacturing factory of the Commune is far from the same as the imperfect forms of those cadre crash courses. The period of time that Commune members stay at each level of work is very long. The process of production learning is accompanied by learning in school.

    In the novel "Flags on the Towers", A.C. Makarenko said the following about the exploration of methods for coordinating production learning and theoretical learning: "In the Communist Youth League, in production meetings, we did not particularly hope for the infamous "connection". So far, the problem of this "connection" has not been solved anywhere, and in essence, it is not far from the problem of synthesis. Therefore, we decided to list some supplementary subjects in the plan, namely: technology, electromechanical engineering, lathes, production organization, and foundry work."

    It is clear from Makarenko's opinion that he was unwilling to take the road of simplifying the tasks of general education schools by borrowing the so-called "connection" between teaching and production learning. Makarenko understood very clearly that only in the process of systematically acquiring basic scientific knowledge can the general scientific principles of modern social production be discovered, and can the high level of intellectual culture that the conscious workers of socialist industry must possess be achieved. Therefore, Makarenko supplemented the tasks of general education schools with the teaching of specialized subjects, with the aim of improving the production training of Commune members.

    In addition to the teaching of specialized subjects, a vast network of production groups was also organized in the Commune, which guaranteed the increase in technical proficiency.

    In this way, the production learning of the Commune members was closely linked with the learning of specialized subjects and the work in the production groups. And this is only a part of the overall problem of combining production labor and learning. The extensive general education that Commune members receive in school in parallel with production work plays a decisive role in learning.

    The basic method of improving the labor productivity of the Commune was the socialist competition. The socialist competition took the form of interesting games full of patriotic content. It played a decisive role during the period of starting the factory.

    In order to reward inventions, Commune members joined the work of the design bureau and the work invention bureau.

    The scene of experimenting with electric drilling machines described by Makarenko in "The Road to Life" is the best illustration of the production initiative and technical pioneering spirit of the Commune members. At that time, it was decided that the Soviet electric drilling machine should be different from the American electric drilling machine and should not emit sparks. For example, the American-style electric drilling machine produced by the power of the advanced scientific and technological thinking of the Soviet youth cultivated by the Dzerzhinsky Commune was superior to the American product.

    Technicians trained in the electric drilling machine factory were transferred to the camera factory to work, where higher precision was required.

    Later, Makarenko said about the new factory: "We asked the children to make bad oranges, bad boots, and sew shirts, and we thought this was beneficial children's labor and children's technology. I thought this way and asked my students to do this kind of work. I interacted with the children for twelve years, and I asked them to make foreign precious and most complex lathes, and asked them to manufacture "Leica" (cameras). What is Soviet "Leica"? It has three hundred parts, and their accuracy is 0.001 millimeters. This kind of production with interchangeable parts is a precise, complex, and difficult thing. Finally, it is the production of optical instruments. This was originally only understood by the Germans, and Imperial Russia was completely incapable of manufacturing precise optical instruments. I am not afraid to entrust such things to the children." (Collected Educational Essays)

    One of the most important events in the life of the Commune was the implementation of the wage system for students.

    Student labor remuneration is a major educational issue. This educational issue has been given a practical and theoretical basis in Makarenko's educational system. This is the result of his struggle against two extreme tendencies: on the one hand, opposing strict education, and on the other hand, opposing the mercantilism of economic entrepreneurs who tried to build education on piece-rate wages. In the third part of his "The Road to Life," Makarenko made a theoretical summary of the experience of organizing paid labor for children. He wrote: "In the wages received, students cultivate the ability to coordinate personal interests with public interests, enter the most complex ocean of the Soviet industrial financial plan, economic accounting, and profitability, study the entire economic system of the Soviet factory, and stand in principle on the same position as all other workers. Finally, he gets used to simply valuing work remuneration, so as not to walk out of the children's home in the style of a noble college student who is not good at life and only has "ideals"."

    The implementation of the wage system requires the effort of educational thought, because here the economic effect achieved is not yet a sign of the educational value of the new measures. It is necessary to consider in advance the new needs that Commune members have because they get money, and it is necessary to take measures in advance so that individual phenomena in the collective do not contradict the interests of the entire collective and the interests of education.

    It must be stated that Makarenko made efforts to maintain the collective mood and eliminate the harm that wages obtained at a young age may bring.

    In order to turn students' paid labor into a powerful means of educational function, Makarenko formulated a special wage leadership system. According to this system, most of the money paid to students is used for public needs, and the other part is used for private needs.

    In this way, the wage system adopted in the Commune cultivated a broad sense of collectivism among the Commune members.

    The amount of a Commune member's wage represents his share in participating in collective labor, and the extent to which he participates in the realization of the Commune's production tasks.

    At the same time, this system is also a source of awareness for a Commune member to recognize the material independence and material security gained by participating in common labor.

    Makarenko's practical wage method cultivated the Commune members' sense of responsibility and care for the young members of the collective, which is necessary for future family members.

    In this prescribed paid labor system, the Commune members feel the collective's concern for him, for his spiritual and cultural needs, and for his future life.

    Wages have become a supplementary means of educating and cherishing public property, which is based on the Commune members' personal material responsibility for preserving such property.

    From a young age, Commune members have been accustomed to valuing labor and cherishing money. He gained some experience in formulating personal budgets.

    All of this freed a Commune member from the mood of being parasitic, and abandoned the dangerous desire for money in an organized collective.

    In practice, wages have cultivated the ability of Commune members to adjust private interests with public interests.

    Makarenko achieved these achievements because he excluded from wages the factor of complete independence in spending money that is dangerous for childhood, because he transferred the right to independently dispose of his wages to adulthood.

    Makarenko's practical child labor payment system originated from the combination of his earlier tested experience of paying children pocket money and the social importance of ordinary adult wages.

    What kind of new conclusions did Makarenko get as a result of organizing children's productive labor in large enterprises equipped with the latest technology?

    First of all, it should be pointed out that Makarenko gave great educational significance to the production process plan. In the concept of "plan," Makarenko included not only the estimated amount of products to be produced, but also the organized relationship of people to processing materials, and the entire complex system of relationships between people, without which the plan could not be fulfilled.

    Makarenko later said in his speech "On Labor Education": The plan "is the most complex equipment of human activities," which refers to the collective labor system, which requires every participant in socialist production to have conscious purpose, precision, organization, and collectivity. In the same speech, Makarenko summarized one of the most important educational tasks of our time. He said: "We need to cultivate this equipment of our citizens, because what they are participating in is not handicraft production, but state-scale production organized with the latest technology." The complexity of large production also gives individuals a vast space for the development of interests and hobbies.

    Commune members not only had the opportunity to work in various workshops of the electric tool manufacturing factory and the camera factory, but they could also develop their activities in the proofing room, in the construction bureau and wage quota bureau, in the planning department, supervision department, and commercial department. The entire construction bureau was managed by Commune members.

    Experiencing a large number of workshops and departments can serve as a means of comprehensively developing the capabilities of Commune members. A Commune member can obtain the most effective results when he ends his production education in the factory tool room, because the tool room produces finished products for two factories, and it is particularly complex and diverse.

    In the already formed character of his students, Makarenko found common characteristics, and these characteristics developed under the influence of the organized system of diverse labor in socialist production. According to Makarenko, this is the characteristic of the breadth and diversity of views, habits, and viewpoints. Commune members who have experienced the above-mentioned system of production education can accurately judge things in workshops that have nothing to do with them.

    One of the significant achievements reached in the production labor process of teenagers and young people is communist moral education based on correctly organizing production behavior and cultivating the habit of production culture. In his speech "Communist Education and Behavior," Makarenko excitedly said about this aspect of the education process:

    "You know what a lathe is. It is solemn, it is beautiful, it is precious, it is shiny. It has beautiful metal parts made of copper. It must be cherished and treasured. And our Soviet children treat it this way. It is out of the question to damage the lathe. Stains on the lathe, unsorted sawdust, should not exist! I see that the problem of stains on the lathe is a moral problem. This is ethics, this is human ethics, the ethics of a person who is young and has already obtained this ethics from our society, obtaining a new human soul of his own. This soul regards the lathe and work as a tracing paper of his own behavior. And our youth is ten thousand times higher than any other youth."

    Makarenko correctly solved the problem of the relationship between production labor for educational purposes. In order to more completely and surely explain his educational views, let us extract a passage from a letter he wrote to a director of the Commune Council in 1932: "There is an opinion that no education is needed, and that working in production alone is education. This is one of the absurd and stupid ideas that fill educational handicraftism. I have heard enough of similar precocious inventions, seemingly revolutionary but actually decadent petty bourgeois "educational" mottos. Please say, who needs a thousand drilling machines, if for this it is necessary to implement a twelve-hour workday, it is necessary to destroy the entire Commune organization, it is necessary to throw away books and other cultural work, day and night, and some people simply become exhausted from consumption."

    Makarenko's experience was formed under the conditions of struggling against the pseudo-educational theory that production is superior to schools, and struggling against the harmful economic position that places curriculum on the profitability of enterprises. His experience made him deeply convinced that children's productive labor must be subordinated to the teaching tasks of the school.

    The experience of combining production labor and learning implemented by Makarenko in the Dzerzhinsky Commune has great principled significance. The system of organizing this educational process takes the elimination of the opposition between intellectual labor and physical labor as its own task. The further we go, the more we will turn to Makarenko's outstanding experience.

    The combination of production labor and learning in the practice of the Dzerzhinsky Commune has become the task of creating all-round development of people in socialist society. However, it inevitably also led to an increase in labor productivity.

    The Commune members developed comprehensively, and at the same time the output of production also increased. Conversely, the Commune members obtained a high level of production on the basis of the combination of learning and production labor, and at the same time, they also developed in terms of intelligence, morality, and physical strength.

    Comrade Stalin taught us that only "the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working class can break the foundation of the opposition between intellectual labor and physical labor, and only in this way can we ensure the high level of labor productivity and extremely abundant consumer goods necessary to begin the transition from socialism to communism."

    The Dzerzhinsky Commune was such an educational institution, in which the task of creating socialist industrial cadres with a high cultural and technical level was realized, and the task of creating real lathe "commanders" was realized.

    In the practice of the Dzerzhinsky Commune, collective socialist labor is a necessary form of activity for realizing all the tasks of children's communist education. In the production labor organized by Makarenko, as in learning labor, the students of the Commune had rich knowledge, and also acquired labor habits. Makarenko's labor cultivated ardent patriots of the socialist motherland, active and pioneering activists of socialist society, and figures with communist morals. Makarenko is an outstanding innovator of Soviet pedagogy. Just like the Stakhanov movement activists, he got rid of conservatism, moved forward bravely, and pulverized all the old educational norms and traditions on his road.

　　VII

    Here a question arises, how did Makarenko reach these new theoretical propositions? According to his own words, we can cite the following factors that express his path of exploration:

    1.  A critical attitude towards various deductive propositions in pedagogy that have the nature of formal logic and obscure the pioneering spirit of education.
    2.  Carefully consider the specific conditions of the task at hand, and "design" educational experiments.
    3.  Implement educational experiments, actively observe and adjust the implementation of the experiments.
    4.  According to the results of the implementation of the experiments, summarize theoretical propositions and assumptions.

    Let us cite an example from Makarenko's educational practice to illustrate what is said above.

    When Makarenko was faced with the task of "conquering Kuryazh," that is, placing three hundred wild children cultivated in the Kuryazh Labor Colony under the influence of the smaller but disciplined students of the Gorky Labor Colony, Makarenko resolutely abandoned the so-called benign basis of "gradually infiltrating" of the "clever people of Kharkov." He put all his plans on a lightning-like attack, and as everyone knows, he brilliantly realized this lightning-like attack with the "declaration" of the Communist Youth League organization at the general meeting of students of the Kuryazh Labor Colony and the Gorky Labor Colony, at which a concrete plan for a new life was signed. After Makarenko tamed the consciousness of the students of the Kuryazh Labor Colony, he set himself the task of organizing their labor activities. And here, he still critically treated the erroneous idea that the organization period must be long, which is deeply rooted in pedagogy.

    Taking a critical attitude towards established traditional norms in pedagogy is one of the characteristics of Makarenko's innovation.

    As everyone knows, when Makarenko was conducting the educational experiment we just mentioned (that is, making the unorganized majority obey the organized minority in order to create a unified children's collective), he started from the method of the future path that he had already carefully considered. According to this method, "if a person has nothing to be happy about in the future, then he cannot live in the world." The famous "declaration" of the Communist Youth League organization is based on this proposition. However, the strength of the educational influence of the "declaration" is not only determined by the principled and accurate premise, but also by the detailed study of the details. Makarenko pointed out in "The Road to Life" that the "declaration" had been discussed several times at the Kuryazh Management Bureau meeting, and was reviewed again when he set out, and was inspected by Communist Youth League activists. This is a delicate plan, because it aims to build a united collective, it contains some good comradely love and lovely comradely severity of the Gorky Labor Colony.

    Carefully weighing all the specific conditions of organizing educational experiments is an important feature of Makarenko's educational innovation.

    Makarenko, seeing the scene of gradually unfolding the taming of the students of the Kuryazh Labor Colony at the congress, constantly contacted the Communist Youth League activists who spoke at the congress, and adjusted the experiment he thought of with great flexibility and educational delicacy. The critical moment to test whether the experiment he thought of was correct came, that is, in the silence after the "declaration" was read, a silent small problem was brewing: "What to do? Send it there? Surrender, protest, or riot? Is it applause, laughter, or silence?" Soon under the ancient vault of the Kuryazh Monastery, perhaps for the first time in history, the pleasant applause of a human collective was issued. Victory was achieved. The educational experiment was brilliantly proven. Giving an active influence to the progress of the educational process conducted in the form of experiments is another characteristic of Makarenko's creative educational activities. Based on his own observations, Makarenko put forward certain propositions after each experiment he conducted. For example, after the above-mentioned victory, Makarenko made the following conclusion:

    "Here the decisive role is no longer even the consideration of interests. Of course, collective suggestion has occurred here. What is decided here is not intention, but eyes, ears, sounds, and laughter." (The Road to Life)

    In another occasion we just mentioned, when the problem of organizing the labor life of the students of the Kuryazh Labor Colony arose, Makarenko reached a very important idea: "Any slightly serious pedagogy will analyze the mechanics of human effort, and point out in it which position belongs to will, self-esteem, shame, susceptibility to suggestion, imitation, terror, competition, and how all this is compounded with the appearance of pure consciousness, conviction, and reason. My experience firmly argues that the distance between the elements of pure consciousness and the direct muscular expenditure is very large, and a chain of some relatively simple and more material elements is absolutely necessary." (Ibid.)

    Makarenko's creative educational thought is expressed in these practice-tested propositions.

    Makarenko's educational system is the product of the era of the heroic struggle of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Lenin Stalin Communist Party for the construction of communism.

    Soviet educators and advanced educators all over the world will learn from his vivid example of life and educational activities to serve the great idea of children's communist education. (End of full text) (Attached pictures)

　　马卡伦柯的生平与其教育学说（下）
            六
    捷尔仁斯基公社里的教育过程是以学习同生产劳动的结合为基础的。据该公社创办人马卡伦柯的话，在这里教育的目的乃是培养苏维埃国家的自觉的公民，共青团员与布尔什维克，组织者与指挥员，培养善于斗争和建设、善于生活并爱生活的人。
    马卡伦柯着手组织捷尔仁斯基公社里的儿童生产劳动时，具有在这方面的理论上熟虑过的教育经验，这经验在高尔基工学团里就积累起来的。
    在捷尔仁斯基公社里，曾建立了生产基地，这个生产基地是与马卡伦柯所布置的教育任务联系起来，而不断地发展和改善的。学生们生产劳动的形式也赖于此而改变；从事生产的少年和青年们的文化技术水平提高了；教学与生产劳动相结合的原则的实现也变化了并复杂化了；生产基础的教育价值也提高了。
    公社所有的学生，人人都吸收在生产生活中了。
    在工厂里，劳动纪律的教育是被特别注意的。公社社员必须要自觉地并精确地执行自己的任务，要不可争辩地和快速地完成自己组长的命令支配，要小心仔细地对待工厂的财产，要依照所通过的生产计划完成一定的产品标准，要参加社会主义竞赛和突击队。
    工厂里的生产学习是依照熟练程度升级的办法而进行的，在升级之前要受一个为时不长的工作训练。熟练工人直接在工厂里训练，参加生产计划之执行。在一定期限内获得了该级的牢固的工作习惯之后，公社社员便被转移到另一级，熟练程度更高的工作上去。在生产学习上，也在熟练工人的造就上，需时为两年半到四年，视专业而定。
    按照熟练程度转移的原则而组织生产学习，有着巨大的教育意义。
    这种制度，乃是不断提高公社社员生产技术熟练程度之经常有效的刺戟。
    在学习的每一阶段上，学生面前都揭开了他的长进的最近前景，揭开了在生产中施展自己创造力的新的可能性。
    马卡伦柯有“前途路线制”的教育思想，“在这些路线上有着明日的欢喜”。那用熟练程度转移办法而组织生产学习，便是这种教育思想的实践表现了。
    尚须指出：公社电气工具制造厂里应用熟练程度转移之形式是和那些干部速成班的不完善的形式，远非相同的。公社社员留在各级工作上的期限是很长的。生产学习的过程伴以学校里的学习。
    在小说“—１”里，Ａ·Ｃ·马卡伦柯关于生产学习与理论学习，配合办法之探索曾说过下面的话：“在共青团，在生产会议里，我们不曾特别希望于那声名狼籍的“联系”。迄今为止，这个“联系”的问题任何地方都没有解决，在实质上这是与综合问题相去不远的。因此我们决定在计划里列了一些补充科目，那就是：工艺学、电工机械、车床、生产组织和铸工。”
    从马卡伦柯这个意见可以很清楚地看出：他不愿走那借所谓教学同生产学习“联系”而使一般教育的学校的任务简单化之路。马卡伦柯很透辟地了解；只有在有系统地摄取科学基本知识之过程中，才能发现现代社会生产之一般科学原则，才能达到社会主义工业的自觉工人所必须的高度的智力的文化。因此，马卡伦柯以专门科目的讲授来补充一般教育的学校的任务，目的是为了改善公社社员的生产训练。
    除了专门科目之讲授以外，在公社里还组织了广大的生产小组网，这些小组保证技术熟练程度的增长。
    这样，公社社员的生产学习是与专门科目的习学以及生产小组中的作业紧密地连系在一起。而这还只是构成生产劳动与学习结合之总问题的一部分。而公社社员在学校里与生产工作平行所获得的广泛的一般教育，对于学习起着决定性的作用。
    提高公社劳动生产率的基本方法是社会主义竞赛。社会主义竞赛采取了充满爱国主义内容的有趣的游戏的方式。它在开办工厂的时期曾起了决定性的作用。
    为了奖励发明，公社社员曾加入设计局的工作以及工作发明局。
    马卡伦柯在“教育诗篇”中所描写的试验电气钻孔机的一幕，乃是公社社员生产积极性和技术首创精神的最好说明。那时曾决定：苏维埃电气钻孔机应与美国电气钻孔机不同，不应冒火花。比如捷尔仁斯基公社所教养成的苏维埃青年的先进科学技术思想的力量所生产的美式电气钻孔机，是凌驾于美国出品以上的。
    在电气钻孔机工厂教养成的技师，被调到照像机工厂去工作，这儿需要更高级的精确性。
    后来马卡伦柯关于新工厂说道：“我们叫孩子们做坏橙子，做坏靴子，缝衬衫，我们认为这是有益的儿童劳动和儿童技术。我曾这样想并叫给自己的学生们作了这样的工作。我和孩子们相交十二年，我叫他们做外国的贵重的最复杂的车床，叫他们造“莱卡”（照像机），苏维埃什么是“莱卡”呢？它有三百种零件，它们的精确度为○·○○一公厘。这种各部分代换性的生产，是一种精确的、复杂的、困难的事情。最后，这是光学器械的生产。这原先只有德国人懂得，而在帝俄是全然不会制造精确的光学器械的。我不害怕把这样事情交付给孩子们。”（教育论文集）
    公社生活中最重要事件之一，乃是对学生实行工资制度。
    学生劳动报酬，乃是一个大的教育问题。这个教育问题在马卡伦柯的教育体系中得到了实践的和理论的根据。这是由于他同两种极端倾向斗争的结果，这便是：一方面反对教育的严格主义，另一方面，反对那力图把教育建筑于计件工资之上的经济事业家的重商主义。马卡伦柯在其“教育诗篇”第三部中，对组织儿童付酬劳动的经验作了理论的概括。他写道：“在领到的工资上，学生养成了配合个人利益与公共利益的才能，进入苏维埃工业财政计划、经济核算、赢利率之最复杂的海洋中，研究了苏维埃工厂的全部经济制度，并在原则上站在同其他一切工人共同的立场上了。最后，他习于单纯地重视工酬，而不致以不善于生活，只具有“理想”的高贵的大学生的样式，走出儿童院。”
    工资制之实行，须要教育思想的努力，因为在这里所获致的经济效果还不是新措施的教育价值之标帜。必须及早考虑到公社社员们因为得到钱而发生的新需要，必须及早采取办法，使集体内个别的现象不与整个集体的利益及教育的利益相矛盾。
    必须说明的是：马卡伦柯曾作到了保持集体情调，清除童龄所得工资可能带来的害处。
    为了把学生的付酬劳动变成教育作用的有力手段，马卡伦柯订立了一个特殊的工资领导制。按照这种制度，付给学生的钱，大部分用于公共需要，另外一部分，用于私人需要。
    这样，公社中所采用的工资制便培养了公社社员们的广义的集体主义情感。
    一个公社社员的工资额，便表现了他参加集体劳动的份儿，表现了他参加实现公社生产任务的程度。
    同时，这种制度对于一个公社社员还是认识因参加共同劳动而获得的物质独立性与物质保障等意识的泉源。
    马卡伦柯实践中工资办法培养了公社社员们的责任感与对集体幼小成员的关怀，这是未来家庭成员所必需的。
    在这种规定的付酬劳动制度中，公社社员感觉到了集体对他的关怀，对他的精神需要与文化需要、以及对他的未来生活的关怀。
    工资成了教育爱护公共财产之补充手段，这是基于公社社员对保存这样财产的个人物质责任而来的。
    公社社员从幼年起，便习惯于重视劳动和爱惜金钱了。他获得了某一些订立个人预算的经验。
    所有这一切，就使一个公社社员摆脱了寄食于人的心情，放弃在有组织的集体中的危险的贪财欲。
    而在实际上，工资则养成了公社社员们调整私人利益与公共利益的能力。
    马卡伦柯获得这些成绩，是由于他从工资中排除了那对于童龄危险的在花费金钱上完全独立的因素，由于他把独自支配自己工资的权利转到成年时期了。
    马卡伦柯的实践中的儿童劳动付酬制，是从他早先检验过的付予儿童零用钱的经验与通常成年人工资的社会重要性方面之结合中产生的。
    由于装备最新技术的大企业里组织儿童生产劳动的结果，马卡伦柯得到了什么样更新的结论呢？
    首先要指出：马卡伦柯给予了生产过程计划以重大的教育意义。在“计划”这个概念里，马卡伦柯不仅包括了预计出产的产品量，而且还包括了人们对于加工材料的有组织的关系、以及人们相互关系的全部复杂体系，没有这种制度，则计划之履行便不能了。
    马卡伦柯后来在自己一次讲演“论劳动教育”中说：计划，“乃是人类活动的最复杂的配备”，这里指的是集体劳动制，这种制度要求社会主义生产的每一个参加者都具有自觉的目的性、精确性、组织性与集体性。就在同一次讲演中，马卡伦柯撮述了我们时代中最重要的教育任务之一。他说：“需要培养我们公民的这种配备，因为他们所参加的并非手工业的生产，而是国家规模的以最新技术组织起来的生产。”大生产的复杂性也给了个人兴味与癖好发展之广大余地。
    公社社员们不仅有可能在电气工具制造厂以及照像机工厂之各种各样车间里工作，而且他们也可以在打样间、在建造局及工资定额局、在计划部、监察部和商业部发展自己的活动。建造局全部是由公社社员们掌管的。
    经历大量车间和部门，可作为全面发展公社社员能力的手段。一个公社社员结束了自己在工厂工具间的生产教育时，就可以获得最有效的结果，因为工具间为两个工厂出产制成品，并且特别复杂，特别多样。
    在自己学生的已经形成的性格中，马卡伦柯找到了共同的特点，他们身上的这些特点是在社会主义生产中多样劳动之有组织体系之影响下发展起来的。按马卡伦柯的话来说，这就是见解、习惯与观点之宽广与多样之特点。公社社员如经历了上述的生产教育的体系的，便能准确地判断那些与他们毫无关系的车间的事情了。
    少年与青年生产劳动过程中所达到的显著成果之一，要算正确组织生产行为和培养生产文化习惯之基础上的共产主义道德教育了。马卡伦柯在“共产主义教育与行为”这次讲演里，关于教育过程的这一方面曾兴奋地说道：
    “你们知道什么是车床了。它是庄严的，它是美丽的，它是宝贵的，它是发亮的。它有着铜质的美丽的金属的部分。必须爱护它、珍惜它。而我们苏维埃的孩子们正是这样对待它的。损害车床之事，是谈不到的。车床上的斑点，不收拾的锯屑，是不应当有的！我看到，车床上斑点的问题乃是一个道德的问题。这是伦理学，这是人的伦理学，是那尚年轻而已从我们社会中取得这种伦理学的，取得新的自己的人类心灵的人之伦理学。这个心灵把车床和工作看作自己行为的模写纸。而我们的青年是较其他任何青年高出万倍的。”
    马卡伦柯正确地解决了为了教育目的的生产劳动关系的问题。为了更完满更确实地阐明他的教育观，让我们从他于一九三二年写给公社理事会一个理事的信中摘引一段：“有一种意见说：不需要任何教育，单是生产中的工作就是教育了，这是教育上的手工业主义的充斥荒唐愚蠢的观念之一。类此早熟发明的、貌似革命而实系陈腐的市侩的‘教育’铭言，我已听得够了。请说一说，正是谁需要一千座钻孔机，假如为此必得实行十二小时的工作日、必得破坏全部公社组织、必得扔开书本和其他的文化工作、没昼没夜、而有些人还干脆累成痨病的话。”
    马卡伦柯的经验是在同那生产优于学校的伪教育理论作斗争，同那把课程置于企业赢利率上的有害的经济立场作斗争的条件下形成的，他的经验使他深深地相信：必须使儿童的生产劳动服从于学校的教学任务。
    马卡伦柯在捷尔仁斯基公社里所实行的生产劳动与学习结合的经验，有着巨大的原则上的意义。这种教育过程组织的制度，乃以清除智力劳动与体力劳动间的对立性作为自己的任务。愈往后去，则我们将愈更多地求助于马卡伦柯的卓越经验。
    捷尔仁斯基公社实践中生产劳动与学习的结合，曾成为造就社会主义社会全面发展的人们的任务。然而它不可避免地同时引起了劳动生产率的提高。
    公社社员全面发展了，同时生产的出品也提高了。反过来说，公社社员们在学习与生产劳动结合的基础上获得了高度的生产水平，同时就在智力、道德、体力各方面也发展了。
    斯大林同志教导我们：只有“工人阶级文化技术水平的提高，才可打破智力劳动与体力劳动间对立性的基础，也只有这样，才能保证开始由社会主义进到共产主义所必要的高度的劳动生产率与十分丰足的消费品。”
    捷尔仁斯基公社曾是这样的一种教育机关，在这个机关里实现了造就具有高度文化技术水平的社会主义工业干部的任务，实现了造就真正车床“指挥员”的任务。
    在捷尔仁斯基公社的实践中，集体的社会主义劳动乃是实现儿童共产主义教育一切任务的活动之必要形式。在马卡伦柯所组织的生产劳动中，正如在学习劳动中一样，公社的学生们都有丰富的知识，并且也获得了劳动习惯。马卡伦柯的劳动培养了社会主义祖国的热烈爱国者，社会主义社会的积极的具有首创精神的活动家，具有共产主义道德的人物。马卡伦柯是苏维埃教育学的卓越的革新者。正如斯达哈诺夫运动者一样，他摆脱了保守主义，勇往直前，碎粉了自己道路上一切陈旧了的教育规范与传统。

    这里发生了一个问题，马卡伦柯如何达到了这些新的理论上的命题呢？根据他自己的言论，我们可举出下列一些表述他的探索道路的因素：
    一、对于教育学中各种具有形式逻辑性质和蔽锢教育首创精神的演绎命题，均持批判的态度。
    二、缜密考虑所提任务的具体条件，而“设计”教育试验。
    三、实施教育试验，积极地观察并调整试验的实行情形。
    四、根据实施试验的结果，而撮述理论性的命题与假设。
    让我们从马卡伦柯教育实践中举一个例子来说明一下上面所说的吧。
    当马卡伦柯面临一个“征服库里亚日”的任务，即使三百个在库里亚日工学团教养的野孩子置于人数较少，但守纪律的高尔基工学团学生们的影响之下的时候，马卡伦柯断然地抛开了“哈尔科夫的聪明人”的所谓良善基础“逐渐渗入”的主张。他把全部打算放在一个闪电般突击上，大家都知道，这个闪电般突击，他用共青团组织在库里亚日工学团学生和高尔基工学团学生全体大会上的“宣言”光辉地实现了，在这次大会上签订了新生活的具体计划。马卡伦柯驯服了库里亚日工学团的学生们的意识后，给自己提出了一个组织他们劳动活动的任务。而在这里，他仍是批判地对待那在教育学中根深蒂固的组织时期必然漫长的谬误思想。
    以批评态度对待教育学中的确立的传统规范，乃是马卡伦柯革新主义的特点之一。
    大家知道，马卡伦柯在进行我们刚说的教育试验（即是为了创立统一的儿童集体而使无组织的多数服从有组织的少数）时，是从他早就周详考虑过的未来路线法出发的。按照这一方法，“假使一个人的前途没有什么可欢喜的地方，那他就不能活在世上了”。著名的共青团组织的“宣言”，就是建筑在这个命题上的。但“宣言”的教育影响的力量，则不仅是由于原则上真确的前提所规定的，而且也由细节的详细研讨所制约的。马卡伦柯在《教育诗篇》中指出，“宣言”曾在库里亚日管理局人员会议上讨论过数次，而在他出发的时候又被审查一遍，并经共青团积极分子检查过。这是一个精细的计划，因为它是以建造团结的集体为目的的，它包含有高尔基工学团的若干良好的同志爱和可爱的同志间的严峻性。
    缜密地权衡组织教育试验之一切具体条件，乃是马卡伦柯的教育革新主义的一个重要特点。
    马卡伦柯，在大会上看到逐步展开的驯服库里亚日工学团学生的情景，就和在大会上讲话的共青团积极分子不断接触，以巨大的灵活性和教育细腻性调整他所想出的试验。应检验所想的试验是否正确的紧要关头到来了，就是在宣读“宣言”以后的寂静中，酝酿着默不发声的小问题：“作什么？派到那儿去？降服，抗议，还是骚乱？是鼓掌，笑，还是默不作声？”不久在库里亚日修道院的古老的穹窿下，可能是破天荒第一遭，发出了人的集体的愉快的掌声。胜利是取得了。教育试验光辉地得到证明了。对以试验形式所进行的教育过程进程予以积极的影响，这又是马卡伦柯创造性的教育活动的一个特点。马卡伦柯根据于自己本身的观察，在他每次所进行的试验之后，就提出某些命题。例如，在上述的胜利以后，马卡伦柯作出了下面的结论：
    “这里起决定性作用的甚至已不是利益的顾虑，当然，这里发生了集体的暗示，这里决定的不是打算，而是眼睛，耳朵，声音和笑。”（教育诗篇）
    在我们所随便讲的另一个场合里，其时发生了一个组织库里亚日工学团学生劳动生活的问题，马卡伦柯达到了下面一个极其重要的思想：“凡稍微认真一点的教育学，必将分析人类努力的机械，指出在其中那个地位属于意志、自尊、羞耻、容受暗示性、模仿、恐怖、竞赛，以及这一切怎样同纯粹意识、确信、理智之出现复合起来。我的经验断然主张，纯粹意识的要素和直接的筋肉支出之间的距离是非常之大的，而某种连系较简单较为物质性的要素的锁链是完全必要的。”（同上）
    马卡伦柯的创造性的教育思想便是表现在这些经过实践考验的命题里面。
    马卡伦柯的教育体系，乃是苏维埃人民在列宁斯大林共产党领导下为建设共产主义而英勇斗争的时代的产物。
    苏维埃的教育家们和全世界先进的教育家们将以他的生活和教育家活动的鲜明榜样，来学习为儿童共产主义教育的伟大思想而服务。（全文完）（附图片）
