　　Ninghe Disaster Area People Actively Expand Production
    Liutaizi Village Changes Dry Land to Paddy Field
    Guaranteeing a Total Increase of 300,000 Jin of Rice for the Whole Village This Year
    [Our Newspaper News] Correspondent Zhao Shaowen reports: In Liutaizi Village, Ninghe New District, Hebei, various policies have been publicized and implemented, and the masses are settled and actively engaged in production, reclaiming wasteland and changing dry land into paddy fields, guaranteeing a total increase of 300,000 jin of rice for the whole village this year. Liutaizi Village has not yet implemented land reform. Last year, the village thoroughly publicized and implemented the policies of "protecting the fruits of labor," the middle peasant policy, the burden policy, and the free lending policy, breaking the masses' ideological concerns and initially establishing the idea of getting rich through labor. In order to ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan, the village, led and assisted by Party members, held family meetings and formulated family plans. After each household made plans (the whole village has 6,949 mu of land and 546 households), the general masses paid attention to improving agricultural technology, such as improving soil and expanding paddy fields. The village plans to cultivate 800 mu of raw wasteland for rice planting, replace alkaline soil with good soil, and raise low-lying land by 76 mu, and convert 138 mu of dry land into paddy fields, a total expansion of rice fields by 1,014 mu compared to last year, guaranteeing an increase of 300,000 jin of rice. To prevent floods, the village also encourages the planting of more early-maturing crops. Middle peasant Liu Runfu said: "Last year, I was afraid of equal distribution and didn't farm well. Now I understand that 'the interests of middle peasants are protected,' and I have seen with my own eyes that more grain is produced without increasing the burden. I will work hard to produce." This year, he also made a production plan. He has prepared 1,000 jin of rotten fish (fertilizer) and 18 cartloads of manure (600 jin per cart), and all 18 mu of land will be planted with rice, guaranteeing an increase of 30 jin to 50 jin of rice per mu. Although poor peasants and farm laborers do not yet have land, they freely form mutual aid groups to reclaim wasteland and plant rice. Li Dayu has united 30 households to form six groups (with 15 small livestock), planning to reclaim 280 mu of wasteland. They started to take action in mid-March and, within three days, dug a one-foot-deep, 190-bow-length drainage ditch, and an eight-foot-wide, 580-bow-length large ridge ditch, plowing more than 80 mu of land. They plan to borrow seeds and fertilizers from relatives and friends through free lending, planning to apply 500 jin to 800 jin of fertilizer per mu, and strive to produce 400 jin of rice per mu. Now, the masses of the whole village are acting to realize increased production, actively engaging in spring plowing from early morning to late night.

　　宁河灾区人民积极扩大生产
    刘台子村变旱田为水田 
    保证今年全村增产稻谷三十万斤
    【本报讯】通讯员赵绍文报导：河北宁河新区刘台子村，宣传与执行了各种政策，群众安心积极生产，开荒、变旱田为水田，保证全村今年增产三十万斤稻谷。刘台子村尚未实行土地改革，该村去年就深入宣传与执行了“保护劳动所得”、中农政策、负担政策、自由借贷政策，打破了群众思想顾虑，初步树立了劳动致富思想。为保证今年增产计划完成，该村在党员带头与帮助下，开家庭会、订出家庭计划。经过各户订计划（全村土地六、九四九亩、五四六户），一般群众都注意提高农业技术，如改良土壤、扩大水田等。全村计开生荒种稻八百亩，起碱土换好土、起高地垫洼地七十六亩，旱田变水田一三八亩，共计比去年扩大稻田一、○一四亩，保证增产三十万斤稻谷。并为预防水患，提倡多种早熟作物。中农刘润富说：“去年我怕平分，没好好种地，现在我懂得，‘保护中农利益’，又亲眼看见了，一样地多打粮食不多拿负担，我要努力生产了。”今年他也作了生产计划。现已准备好一千斤烂鱼（肥料），十八车大粪（每车六百斤），十八亩地都种稻子，保证每亩增产三十斤至五十斤稻谷。贫雇农虽还没有土地，就自由结成互助组开荒种稻。李大玉已结合了三十户，组成六小组（有十五头小牲口），计划开荒二八○亩。他们自三月中旬已开始行动，三天内，挖成一尺深、一百九十弓长的泄水沟，八尺宽，五百八十弓长的大垅沟，翻地八十多亩。种籽、肥料准备找亲戚、朋友自由借贷，计划每亩施肥五百斤至八百斤，每亩争取产稻谷四百斤。现全村群众都行动起来，起早搭晚为实现增产，积极春耕。
