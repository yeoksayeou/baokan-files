Unable to Save the Collapse of the Capitalist System: "Marshall Plan's" Struggling Failure
U.S. Official "Anniversary" Remarks Filled with Pessimism

(Xinhua News Agency, April 7th) Washington held an official ceremony on April 3rd to commemorate the second anniversary of the Marshall Plan, which began with Truman signing the so-called "Foreign Aid Act." According to Soviet Pravda reporter Zhukov, this commemoration was particularly cold and deserted. No jubilant speeches could be heard in Paris, London, or Washington. In Washington, the remarks made by U.S. officials on the "anniversary" could not conceal their worries about the future and the escalating contradictions between the U.S. and Marshall Plan nations.

Marshall, the founder of the Marshall Plan, delivered a speech at the commemoration ceremony. Marshall shouted, "Make a great final effort in the next two years. Eliminate old trade barriers and establish new channels such as the European Payments Union." Marshall this time removed the mask that had always painted the Marshall Plan as "economic aid" and openly admitted its reactionary political purpose. He openly declared that the Marshall Plan was "an investment to save all the former creeds and what we call the democratic way of life." But Marshall could not but feel the difficulty of his struggle to save the declining capitalist system. He said, "The most important aspect of the revival is related to other considerations—political, moral, and spiritual. These things are less tangible and more difficult to deal with. Not only have centuries of trade and business relations been completely eliminated, but also the faith and confidence in the basic institutions of many modern civilizations have disappeared. The revival of these things is a very difficult task."

At the same time, the so-called "Economic Cooperation Administration" specifically published Hoffman's speech to the U.S. Congress last month on April 2nd. Hoffman's speech helplessly admitted the gloomy past and future of the Marshall Plan. After mentioning that the dollar deficit of the Marshall Plan countries had reached more than four billion U.S. dollars, Hoffman admitted: "To make up for this deficit, Europe can only sell more to us and buy less from us, and this is not a happy prospect from either their or our point of view." Hoffman could not avoid the fact that the Marshall Plan countries were becoming increasingly impoverished under this "aid" from the United States, but he shamelessly blamed it on the too rapid population growth in Western Europe, and said, "If they continue to have children according to the current fertility rate, I don't know if this problem can be solved." However, what Hoffman avoided was revealed from the "achievements" of the Marshall Plan that he boasted about. Figures prove that the Marshall Plan has destroyed the normal trade relations of Western European countries, which is the real reason for Western Europe's dollar deficit and poverty. Hoffman pointed out that more than a quarter of the Marshall Plan funds were used to purchase American grain, while Western Europe could have obtained grain from Eastern Europe without spending U.S. dollars. The total amount of Western Europe's exports to the United States does not exceed a "negligible" 1.25 billion U.S. dollars per year, while it was much higher before the war. Hoffman's speech also shows that the United States is further exerting pressure on Western Europe to intensify its conspiracy to force the European economy to implement so-called "integration." He said that the latter half of the Marshall Plan yet to be done is to establish a single huge market in Western Europe similar to the single U.S. market.

　　无法挽救资本主义制度的没落  “马歇尔计划”挣扎失败
    美国官方的“纪念日”言论充满悲观情绪
    【新华社七日讯】四月三日，华盛顿举行了官方仪式，以纪念杜鲁门签署所谓“援外法案”而开始实行马歇尔计划的两周年。据苏联真理报记者朱可夫指出，这次纪念事前特别显得冷冷清清，无论在巴黎、伦敦或在华盛顿，都听不到兴高彩烈的演说。在华盛顿，美国官方在“纪念日”发表的言论，都掩盖不了对前景的忧心和美国与马歇尔化国家间日益加剧的矛盾。
    作为马歇尔计划创始人的马歇尔在纪念仪式上发表了演说。马歇尔叫喊“在以后两年中作极大的最后努力。消除旧的贸易壁垒，建立例如欧洲清算同盟那样的新的通道。”马歇尔这次摘下了向来粉饰马歇尔计划为“经济援助”的假面具而公开承认其反动的政治目的。他公然宣称，马歇尔计划乃是“一种要挽救所有从前那些信条和我们称之为民主生活方式的投资”。但是马歇尔却不能不对其挽救没落中的资本主义制度的挣扎，感到困难。他说：“复兴中最重要的一面与其他的考虑——政治的、道德的、精神的——有关。这些东西都是较不可捉摸的，而且更难于应付。不但千百年来贸易和商务关系已经完全消灭，而且对于许多现代文明的基本制度的信仰与信心，也随之而去，这些东西的复兴，是非常困难的工作。”
    同时，所谓“经济合作总署”于四月二日特地发表了马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼上月在美国国会的演说。霍夫曼的演说无可奈何地承认了马歇尔计划过去以及未来的黯淡。霍夫曼在提到马歇尔化各国的美元赤字达到四十亿美元以上的数字后承认：“要弥补这种赤字，只有欧洲多卖点给我们并从我们方面少买点，而这事无论从他们或我们的观点看都不是快乐的远景。”霍夫曼也不能回避马歇尔化国家在美国这种“援助”下日益贫困的事实，但他竟无耻地归咎于西欧人口增殖太快，而说“假使他们依照目前的生育率继续生孩子，我不知道这种问题是否能获得解决。”但是，为霍夫曼所讳言的却从他所吹嘘的马歇尔计划“成绩”中透露出来。数字证明马歇尔计划破坏了西欧国家的正常贸易关系，这是西欧美元赤字与贫困的真正原因。霍夫曼指出：马歇尔计划款项中有四分之一强是用来购买美国粮食的，而原来西欧却可以无须花费美元而从东欧获得粮食。西欧对美国的输出总额每年不超过“微不足道”的十二亿五千万美元，而战前却远高于这一水平。霍夫曼的演说，同时表明美国正进一步对西欧施加压力，以加紧其迫使欧洲经济实行所谓“整体化”的阴谋。他说：马歇尔计划尚待做的后一半，是要在西欧建立一个类似单一的美国市场的单一巨大市场。
