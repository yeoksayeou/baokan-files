How Should Branches and Study Committees Improve the Leadership of Theoretical Study
    Jin Sha

In mid-March, the reporter visited five branch offices in Beijing to discuss the issue of theoretical study leadership by branches: the General Branch of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the branch of the Personnel Department and the Bureau of Culture and Education of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the General Branch of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the First and Second Branches of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. These branches generally called on and led party members and non-party cadres to conduct theoretical study (currently mainly the study of political economy) and basic policy study. However, because not all branches understood the importance of theoretical study from practical work experience, the understanding and effort put into study by these branches varied. The effectiveness of study naturally differed as well. As of the time of the reporter's visit, most of those in these agencies participating in the study of political economy, with the exception of a small number who had a relatively clear understanding of several major issues in the capitalist economy, were still not very clear. Some switched to studying other books halfway through; some simply stopped studying altogether, and even questioned whether these theoretical books were essential reading for cadres at the moment.

Upon examining the reasons, the reporter believes that there are some problems in the leadership of study that urgently need to be resolved. The various agencies are currently rectifying study, and this is specifically proposed for research.

First, although most branches have tried to maintain the study system, they have paid little or no attention to the ideological leadership of study. Those studying are troubled by the fact that they cannot discover problems or solve problems in their studies. Some people are asking themselves: "How much will we actually gain from studying like this?!" This is a problem that deserves attention.

Originally, the ideological leadership of study was a relatively heavy task. It is difficult to complete by entrusting it entirely to the study committee and the branch. A portion of this work must be undertaken personally by the leaders of the agencies. However, the work of the leaders of the agencies is indeed very heavy now, and many of them often work until midnight. As a result, some people think that it seems inappropriate to emphasize "leaders taking responsibility and doing it themselves" any further. However, there are indeed some serious difficulties in the current study that must be resolved by the leaders themselves. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to rapidly improve the working ability of cadres – to improve their theoretical and policy level and professional knowledge. Moreover, only by gradually improving the level of cadres can some unnecessary busyness of the leaders be reduced. Therefore, the leadership principle of "leaders taking responsibility and doing it themselves" should still be put forward. To achieve this, the leaders of the various agencies must arrange their work more scientifically.

How should leaders take responsibility? How should they do it themselves? As some branches have proposed: First, "If the leaders share their learning experiences with everyone, everyone will not only learn a lot from it, but also understand the methods of learning: how to discover problems, raise problems, analyze problems, and solve problems." Second, "Leaders have a long revolutionary history, rich experience in struggle, a clear stance and viewpoint, and a deep understanding of problems, which can help them answer some questions for everyone. Even if the leaders invite experts to answer questions, it is relatively easy." Third, "Leaders should regularly check the study situation, point out what problems have been solved well in this period of study, what problems have not been solved well? How should we study in the future? How much time should be spent on studying what problems, etc.?" Fourth, when holding large discussion meetings, inviting leaders to participate in the guidance and provide some inspiration will make the discussions more profound. If possible, it would be even better if the leaders could draw conclusions. The result of doing so will be of great help to the progress of study.

Other problems in study, such as the contradiction between work and study, can also be properly resolved as a result.

Second, in the leadership of theoretical study, there must be both unified concentration and division of labor and cooperation. Although some branches also proposed that theoretical study should be guaranteed, they mistakenly believed that the participation of branch committee members in the work of the study committee was the entire guarantee work of the branch for theoretical study, and did not or rarely carried out other guarantee work. In addition, some branch committee members working in the study committee did not promptly report the work of the study committee to the branch and conduct discussions. Therefore, some branches could not discover the ideological and cognitive tendencies and problems of party members and non-party members in their studies, and correct and resolve them in a timely manner.

How should the branch lead study? That is, through the supervision and guarantee of study by party members.

The branch must first clarify that theoretical study should be uniformly concentrated under the leadership of the study committee. Therefore, the formulation of study guidelines and methods, the control of the study progress, the hosting of large discussion meetings, the answering of questions, and the collection and reporting of information should all be the responsibility of the study committee. The leadership of the branch should, through the party members and branch committee members in the study committee, examine and supervise whether the study committee is regularly and correctly carrying out these tasks. At the same time, the branch should also examine the guidelines and plans decided by the study committee, and consider whether these plans are in line with the intentions of the higher-level party committee and the higher-level study committee, and whether they are suitable for the situation of the agency. If the branch has any opinions on the study plan, it should submit them for discussion through the party members and branch committee members in the study committee. If necessary, the branch can directly make suggestions to the study committee. Secondly, the branch, through party members and uniting non-party members, guarantees and supervises the implementation of the study plan. After studying the plan of the study committee, the branch should specifically organize forces to implement the study plan. At the same time, it should always pay attention to the various ideological and cognitive tendencies and problems of party members and non-party members in their studies. Once incorrect tendencies and problems are found in the study, they should be corrected immediately through the active elements among the party members. Major problems should be studied and resolved jointly with the study committee.

Third, many branches have proposed that there are too many types of study now, and there is a phenomenon of average use of forces and distraction of attention. Li Yifan, the propaganda committee member of the Bureau of Culture and Education of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, said:

"The higher-level party committee and the higher-level study committee assign too many study tasks, and there is too little time for study below. When assigning theoretical study, they also emphasize that the study of basic knowledge of the party should not stop. When assigning professional study, they also point out that it should not take up theoretical study time, nor should it stop the study of basic knowledge of the party. When assigning the study of current affairs documents, it is still not possible to stop this study, nor can it take up that study time. But the study time is still the same."

In view of the current situation of cadres, these studies are naturally necessary. But according to the specific situation of today's work, study should have a focus. Some people should regard theory, policy, and professional knowledge as the basic content of study. Some people should take culture, policy, and professional knowledge as the basic content of study. The former group of comrades should have a considerable political and cultural foundation with a relatively long history of revolutionary struggle, and whose current work urgently requires the study of theory and policy. But professional work is equally important and should also be placed in an appropriate position. The study of current affairs can take the form of large-scale reports. For particularly important ones, two or three days can be taken to study them. For the study of basic knowledge of the party, a special report in the form of a large conference can be adopted, or it can be used as one of the contents of the group meeting study. Some branches are already improving in this way.

Secondly, whether it is theoretical study or policy study, it should be carried out with a focus. For example, the chapter on commodities in political economy is part of Marx's theory of value, which is relatively difficult to learn. This can be studied in the form of large and small meetings, discussions, lectures, reports, question and answer tests, etc. Let everyone have a relatively clear understanding of several basic issues as much as possible.

Fourth, who should study theory? Who should not study theory? Has become a problem that needs to be solved urgently today. Some people regard the study of theory as a "political treatment." It seems that studying theory is "glorious" and has a high status. Therefore, regardless of whether they have a foundation for studying theory or not, they always try their best to get themselves into the theory study group. This is wrong.

Some study leaders are greedy for leadership convenience and, regardless of the objective situation, put people who should not be studying theory for the time being into the theory study group.

The study of these two types of people is very bad. Although some people can barely learn when they start studying the first two chapters of political economy because they have studied the history of social development. Problems arise later. Some people cannot even read complicated sentences, so naturally they cannot understand the meaning of the whole article. Some also switched to studying other books, which is of course good, but the previous period of time has been wasted. Some people simply do not study at all, which is of course even worse.

Therefore, on the one hand, the situation should be understood based on what is usually known. On the other hand, the results of the test during the grouping should be added. Those who have a theoretical foundation can be assigned to the theoretical group to study. If any aspect of the conditions is not met, regardless of how many years of revolutionary history he has, regardless of what position he currently holds, regardless of whether he is a university student or a technical school graduate, he should not be assigned to the theoretical group to study. Or set up a preliminary theory study group, or assign them to the basic policy study group or the culture group to study. After finishing a book, conduct a test, and then group them separately according to the test results. Some agency study committees and branches are already paying attention to solving this problem.

Fifth, the study method is a very important issue, and the quality of the study method can also determine the size of the study results. However, some agency branches and study committees do not pay much attention to researching and improving study methods. For example, advocating the self-study method is correct, but it does not generally oppose any collective study method. But now some people oppose all collective study methods, and even oppose the unified study of a theoretical book. They want to study other books at will. Or they oppose taking notes, etc.

Some branches (such as the General Branch of the Beijing Municipal Committee) have begun to stipulate some of the following study methods: those who have the ability to self-study should self-study, and those who do not have the ability to self-study should listen to reports, but all must conduct regular discussions.

In terms of future study methods, it is best that a work unit uniformly study one kind of book (reference books are not included), and the study progress should also be roughly the same. This facilitates the exchange of opinions and discussions. Secondly, notes should be taken. Those who cannot take notes should start by writing marginal notes and recording questions, and gradually learn to write summaries and write心得. Taking notes can help memory and thinking. Thirdly, there should be discussions and casual talks. After discovering problems, you should first ask and answer yourself, and then exchange opinions and discuss with others. Even if the discussion does not produce results, it can always inspire each other and be more profound and extensive than originally understood. Fourthly, we should learn to connect with reality, grasp the spirit and essence of the documents, and analyze the developing and changing things in the actual movement. At the beginning, you can first connect with your own thoughts and work, and then gradually expand the application to other aspects.

　　支部与学习委员会应如何改进领导理论学习
    金沙
    三月中旬，记者就支部领导理论学习问题，访问了北京市五个机关支部：中共北京市委会机关总支部、北京市人民政府人事处支部与文教局支部、北京市总工会总支部、中国人民银行北京分行第一第二支部。这些支部一般地都号召和领导了党员与非党干部进行了理论学习（目前主要是政治经济学学习）和基本政策的学习。但是由于并不是所有支部都从实际工作体会到理论学习的重要，因而这些支部对学习的认识及所下功夫就不太相同。学习的效果自然也就要不一样。截至记者访问时为止，这些机关中参加政治经济学学习的除少部分人对资本主义经济中几个主要问题了解的比较明确外，大部分人还是不太清楚的。有的学到一半，就改学其他书籍；有的甚至干脆不学习了，而且怀疑到这些理论书是不是目前干部所必读。
    检查其原因，记者认为主要是学习领导上存在着一些问题急待解决。现在各机关正在整顿学习，特提出研究。
    第一，多数支部虽然设法坚持了学习制度，但却很少甚至没有注意对学习的思想领导。学习的人在苦恼着学习中发现不了问题，解决不了问题。就有人在这样问自己：“这样学习下去，究竟会有多少收获呢？！”这是值得注意的一个问题。
    本来对学习的思想领导是一件比较繁重的工作。完全交给学习委员会与支部去领导是难于完成的。其中有一部分工作，必须机关首长亲自来担负。但是各机关首长的工作现在确是十分繁重，他们中有不少人常常工作到深夜十二时。这样有些人就以为似乎不应当再强调“首长负责，亲自动手”了。但是目前学习上确实存在着必须首长亲自来解决的一些严重困难。另一方面，又迫切需要迅速提高干部工作能力——提高理论政策水平与业务知识。并且，只有逐步提高干部水平，才能减轻首长的某些不必要的繁忙。因此“首长负责、亲自动手”的领导方针还是应该提出来的。要作到这点，各机关首长必须要更科学的来安排自己的工作。
    首长怎样负责呢？怎样动手呢？正如有些支部所提出的：第一，“首长如果把自己的学习心得对大家谈谈，大家就不但因此知道了很多东西，并且懂得了学习的方法：如何发现问题，提出问题，分析问题，解决问题。”第二，“首长有较长的革命历史，有丰富的斗争经验，立场观点明确，了解问题深刻，可以给大家解答一部分问题。就是首长去请专家来解答问题，也比较容易。”第三，“首长要定期检查学习情形，指出这一时期学习中什么问题解决的好，什么问题解决的不好？今后怎样学习？什么问题学习多少时间等等？”第四，召开大讨论会时，请首长参加指导，作些启发，就会使大会讨论的更深刻些。有可能的话，首长能够作结论自然更好。这样做的结果对学习的进行将会有很大的帮助。
    学习上的其他问题，如工作与学习的矛盾等问题，因此也能得到适当的解决。
    第二，在理论学习领导上既要统一集中，又要分工合作。有些支部虽然也提出应当保证理论学习，但却把支部委员参加学习委员会工作，误认为就是支部对理论学习的全部保证工作，再不或很少进行其他保证工作。加之在学习委员会工作的某些支部委员，没有及时向支部汇报学习委员会的工作情况，并进行讨论。因此有些支部就不能发现党员与非党员在学习中的思想、认识倾向与问题，并及时纠正解决。
    支部如何来领导学习呢？那就是通过党员对学习进行监督与保证。
    支部首先要明确，理论学习应当统一集中于学习委员会领导。因此规定学习方针与学习方法，掌握学习进度主持大的讨论会，解答问题，搜集汇报等都应当归学习委员会负责。支部的领导则应通过在学习委员会的党员与支部委员，考察与监督学习委员会是否经常地与正确地在进行这些工作。同时支部也应当对学习委员会所决定的方针计划加以考察，考虑这些计划是否符合上级党委会与上级学习委员会意图，和适合本机关情况。支部如果对学习计划有意见时，应通过在学习委员会的党员与支委提交讨论。必要时支部可以直接向学习委员会提出建议。其次支部通过党员与团结非党员，保证与监督实现学习计划。支部在研究学习委员会计划后，要具体组织力量来实现学习计划。同时要时时刻刻注视在学习中的党员与非党员的各种思想、认识倾向与问题。一旦发现学习中有不正确倾向与问题时，立即通过党员中的积极分子设法纠正。重大问题，应当与学习委员会共同研究解决。
    第三，许多支部提出：现在的学习种类太多了，并且有平均使用力量和分散注意力的现象。北京市人民政府文教局支部宣传委员李一帆同志这样说：
    “上级党委会与上级学习委员会布置的学习任务太多，下面学习的时间太少。在布置理论学习时，同时强调对党的基本知识的学习不停。布置业务学习时，又指出不能占理论学习时间，也不能停止对党的基本知识学习。在布置学习时事文件时，还是既不能停止这个学习，又不能占那个学习时间。可是学习时间还是那一些。”
    就今天的干部情况说，这些学习自然都是必要的。但根据今天工作具体情况说，学习是应当有重点的。一部分人应当将理论、政策、业务常识作为基本的学习内容。一部分人应以文化、政策、业务常识为基本学习内容。前一部分同志应是已有较长的革命斗争经验相当的政治文化基础，而现在担任的工作又迫切需要理论与政策的学习。但业务同样重要，也应放在适当的地位。时事学习可以采用大会报告的形式。特殊重要的可抽两三天时间来学习。对党的基本知识学习，采取大会专题报告的形式，也可作为小组会学习内容之一。现在已有些支部正在这样改进。
    其次无论理论学习、或政策学习，应有重点的进行。例如政治经济学商品一章是马克思价值论的部分，比较难学，这就可以采用大会小会讨论、演讲报告，问答测验等等形式来学习。让大家尽可能对几个基本问题有比较明确的了解。
    第四，谁应当学习理论？谁不应当学习理论？已成为今天急须解决的问题。有些人把学习理论当作了“政治待遇”。似乎学习了理论就“光荣”，就地位高。因此不管自己有无学理论的基础总是想尽各种办法争取自己编入理论组学习。这是不对的。
    有些学习领导上贪图领导方便，不管客观情况，把暂时不应当学习理论的人，也编进了理论学习组。
    这两种人的学习就非常不好。虽然有些人因为学习了社会发展史，在开始学习政治经济学一二章时还可以勉强学下去。往后就发生问题了，有些人连复杂的句子也读不下去了，自然就无法了解通篇的意义了。有些也就改学了其他书籍，这当然还是好的，但已把前一段时间浪费了。有些人根本不学习了，这当然更不好。
    因此，一方面应当根据平日所了解的情况，另一方面应加上编组时的测验结果。有学习理论基础的，才能编入理论组学习，如果任何一方面的条件不够，不管他有多年革命历史，不管他现在担任什么职务，不管他是大学生还是专门学校毕业生，一律不应编到理论组学习。或另设初步理论学习组，或编入基本政策学习组，文化组学习。学完一本书后，进行测验，按测验结果再分别编组学习。现在有些机关学习委员会与支部已在注意解决这个问题。
    第五，学习方法是很重要的一个问题，学习方法的好坏，也可以决定学习成果的大小。但是某些机关支部和学习委员会，并不十分注意来研究与改进学习方法。如提倡自修学习方法是对的，但并不因此一般地反对任何集体学习方法。而现在就有些人反对一切集体学习办法，甚至反对统一学习一种理论书籍。要随便学习其他书籍。或者是反对作笔记等等。
    现在有些支部（如北京市委会机关总支部）开始规定了这样一些学习方法；有自修能力的自修，没有自修能力的听报告，但均须进行定期讨论。
    在今后的学习方法上，最好是一个工作单位统一学习一种书籍（参考书不包括在内），学习进度亦要大体相等。这样便于交换意见和讨论。其次应该作笔记，不会作的，开始写眉批，记问题，逐渐学会记摘要，写心得。记笔记是可以帮助记忆和思考的。再次应该讨论，漫谈。在发现问题后首先应当自问自答，然后和别人交换意见和讨论。即使讨论得不到结果，但总可以互相启发而比原来了解的深刻些广泛些。再次应当学习联系实际，掌握文件的精神与实质，去分析在实际运动中发展变化的事物。开始可以先联系自己的思想和工作，然后逐渐地扩大运用到其他方面去。
