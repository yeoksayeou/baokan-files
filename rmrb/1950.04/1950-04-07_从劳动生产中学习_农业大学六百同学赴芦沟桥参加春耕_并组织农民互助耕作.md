　　Learning from Labor Production
    Agricultural University's Six Hundred Students Go to Lugouqiao to Participate in Spring Plowing
    And Organize Farmers for Mutual Aid in Farming
    [This Newspaper's Report] The labor internship class composed of over six hundred first-year students from the Agricultural University went to the Lugouqiao Farm on the 6th to begin "agricultural labor learning." Before departing, the class underwent two weeks of political study and prepared for the internship. The Lugouqiao Farm has a total of more than 1,350 mu of land, of which 205 mu are allocated for students' internships and spare-time production. In addition, the students have formed two cooperative groups to cultivate 157 mu of land with 25 nearby farmers, in order to guide the farmers towards mutual aid in farming. On the evening of the 3rd, the class held a spring plowing mobilization meeting. Le Tianyu, director of the school committee, gave a report to all students on the learning trip to Lugouqiao. He pointed out: Spring plowing is learning, combining theory with practice. He also emphasized that students should humbly learn from farmers and have the attitude of being elementary school students. He hoped that students would transform themselves, improve themselves, learn to help farmers produce, learn to approach farmers, and cultivate themselves into talents loved by farmers during the spring plowing. They should also overcome the difficulties in spring plowing and strive to be models.

    农业大学六百同学赴芦沟桥参加春耕
    并组织农民互助耕作
    【本报讯】农业大学一年级学生六百余人组成的劳动实习班，已于六日赴芦沟桥农场开始“农耕劳动学习”。出发前，该班曾经过两星期的政治学习，并作好了实习准备工作。芦沟桥农场共有一千三百五十余亩土地，其中二百零五亩拨交同学实习和业余生产之用；另外，由同学组成两个合作小组，与附近二十五户农民共种植一百五十七亩土地，以引导农民走向互助耕作。三日晚，该班曾举行春耕动员大会，该校乐天宇主任委员向全体学员作了有关到芦沟桥学习的报告。他指出：春耕就是学习，使理论与实际结合起来。并强调同学们应虚心向农民学习，要有当小学生的态度。他希望同学们在春耕中改造自己，提高自己，学会帮助农民生产，学会接近农民，养成一个为农民所热爱的人材；并应克服春耕中的困难，争取当模范。
