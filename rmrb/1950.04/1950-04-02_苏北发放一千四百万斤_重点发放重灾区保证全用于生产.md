　　Northern Jiangsu Distributes 14 Million Catties
    Focusing on Heavily Affected Areas to Ensure All are Used for Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Liberation Daily news on March 29th: In order to solve the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing for farmers in disaster areas, various places in Northern Jiangsu promptly distributed huge amounts of agricultural loans. The Northern Jiangsu Branch of the People's Bank of China decided to issue 14 million catties of rice for spring loans, deciding to focus on seed loans, with the rest being partial loans for agricultural tools, fishery loans, and fertilizer loans, etc., and stipulated that the Huaiyin Special District, a severely affected area, should be the key area for distribution. At present, the Northern Jiangsu Branch has notified local sub-branches to quickly transfer the prepared agricultural loan materials to the loan distribution areas. When distributing, local cadres are required to correctly grasp: First, resolutely implement the "focus on key distribution" policy. Although the amount of agricultural loans this time is large, it is necessary to oppose the phenomenon of egalitarianism. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that all agricultural loans are used for production, and strictly prevent cadres from giving favors and relief perspectives, as well as the problem of eating and using them. The seeds lent must also be good seeds. In order to solve the cotton seed difficulties in the cotton reclamation areas, the Northern Jiangsu Cotton Reclamation Bureau specially purchased and transported tens of thousands of dan of high-quality cotton seeds such as Dezi cotton and Daizi cotton from Shandong Province. According to the actual situation in various places, it was decided to issue 25,000 dan to Yancheng Special District, 15,000 dan to Huaiyin Special District, and more than 5,000 dan to Nantong Special District. At the beginning of March, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office also transported 12,000 dan of Dezi cotton seeds (enough for 150,000 mu of cotton fields) from Zhejiang Province and lent them to Yancheng Special District, and separately allocated 50 million catties of rice to the Yancheng Cotton Reclamation Bureau to purchase cotton seeds. The bureau has now purchased more than 10,000 dan in Sheyang, Binhai and other places. The above-mentioned cotton seeds are now being distributed in a planned manner.

　　苏北发放一千四百万斤
    重点发放重灾区保证全用于生产
    【本报讯】据三月廿九日解放日报消息：为解决灾区农民春耕春种生产困难，苏北各地及时发放巨额农贷。人民银行苏北分行决定发放春贷大米一千四百万斤，决定以种贷为主，其他则为部分的农具贷款、渔业贷款、肥料贷款等，并规定以重灾区淮阴专区为发放重点区。目前苏北分行已通知各地支行将事先准备好的农贷实物迅速调运至贷放地区。在发放时，要求各地干部必需正确掌握：首先坚决贯彻“重点发放”方针，这次农贷数虽大，但必须反对平均主义现象。同时还须保证农贷全部用于生产，严防干部恩赐和救济观点，和吃掉用掉毛病。所放贷种亦必需是好种。为解决棉垦区棉种困难，苏北棉垦局特从山东地区购买运来德字棉、岱字棉等优良棉种数万担，根据各地实际情况，决定发给盐城专区二万五千担，淮阴专区一万五千担，南通专区五千余担。苏北行署又于三月初，从浙江省运来德字棉种一万二千担（可供十五万亩棉田种植）贷给盐城专区，并另外拨五千万斤大米给盐城棉垦局收购棉种，现该局已在射阳、滨海等地购好万余担。上述棉种现正有计划的发放。
