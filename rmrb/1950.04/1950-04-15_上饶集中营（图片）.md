    During "Spiritual Indoctrination"
    The Kuomintang secret agents' so-called "spiritual indoctrination" often lasted three or four hours at a time. Comrades often organized themselves during this time, with lookouts posted in front, behind, and to the sides, taking turns covering for each other to study theory. Books were scarce, obtained with great effort and risk, stolen from the piles of books confiscated by the secret agents, or brought in through outside connections (which was even more difficult). A book was often taken apart and hidden or suspended inside clothing.
    We are not alone!
    One day, the comrades saw a news item on the fourth column of the first page of the Kuomintang bandit gang's Third War Area's Frontline Daily: "...The 'remnants' of the New Fourth Army in Northern Jiangsu, under the acting commander Chen Yi, are organized into seven divisions: First Division Commander Su Yu, Second Division Commander..." The comrades hid in the corners of the wall, excitedly looking at and reciting this news. In this way, their confidence in the truth was further strengthened.

    在“精神训话”的时候
    国民党特务们所谓“精神训话”，一次常常要继续三四个钟头。同志们常常在这时候组织起来，前后左右按上耳目，轮流掩蔽着学习理论。书很少，都是煞费苦心、冒着危险，从特务们查禁的书堆里偷来，或是通过外面的关系（这更困难）带进来的。一本书常常是拆散了隐藏起来或吊在衣服里面。
    我们并不孤单！
    有一天，同志们从国民党匪帮第三战区的前线日报一版第四栏上，看到一条新闻：“……苏北新四军‘残部’，由陈毅代军长，下编七个师：第一师师长粟裕，第二师师长……。”同志们躲在墙脚里，兴奋地看着，念着这条新闻。这样，他们对真理的信心是更坚定了。
