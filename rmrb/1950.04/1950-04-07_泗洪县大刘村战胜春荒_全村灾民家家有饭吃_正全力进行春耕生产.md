Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: Da Liu Village in Sihong County, northern Anhui (newly established county, southeastern Sihong County, west bank of Hongze Lake), which suffered a severe disaster, has fully invested in sideline production, and has now overcome the serious spring famine. Da Liu Village has a total of 131 households with 521 people. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the village two years ago, they looted 40,000 catties of grain. Last year, the village suffered another flood, and only 8,000 catties of grain were harvested from the village's more than 2,500 mu of land. By mid-January of this year, most families in the village had run out of food, and only 52 households had enough to eat for three months. In order to rescue the severe famine and ensure that no one starved to death, the village chief Zhang Huaide, the Communist Party group, the Communist Youth League group, and the production and disaster relief group took the lead in contributing grain and persuaded the farmers to contribute all their grain as a production fund, collecting a total of 3,200 catties of grain. The government also lent the village 1,300 catties of grain for production and disaster relief. After the problem of the villagers' production rations was solved, all the full laborers and semi-laborers in the village were organized, under the principle of voluntary association, to engage in sideline production. Sixteen vermicelli making groups, three oil pressing groups, three grass selling groups, and five grass cutting groups were organized. The villagers were extremely enthusiastic about production. Bai Fanglan, the director of the village women's association, and her family participated in four kinds of sideline production: vermicelli making, oil pressing, grass selling, and pig selling. She herself makes vermicelli and dries noodles during the day and presses oil at night. The villagers have made great profits after forty days of hard work. The thirteen groups making pea vermicelli, with 89 households participating, make 390 catties of pea vermicelli every day, earning 702 catties of bean dregs and 20 buckets of soy milk, averaging seven catties of dregs and two large basins of soy milk per household. The oil pressing group pressed 1,500 catties of peanuts in eight days, and each household could get seven or eight pieces of peanut cake. The grass cutting group can buy one dou of grain for each trip to Hongze Lake to cut grass. In the past forty days, all kinds of sideline production in the village have generated a net profit of 15,000 catties of grain and 40,000 catties of picked grass. All the villagers have achieved the goal of having food to eat and grass to burn. In early March, under the leadership of the district people's government, the village held a commendation meeting and a sideline product exhibition. Village Chief Zhang Huaide and Da Chong's mother and Aunt Dong were commended as second-class heroes for their active production and uniting the masses to promote production; ten people were commended as third-class heroes, and five people were commended as fourth-class heroes. The Sihong County People's Government and the CPC County Committee and other units presented the village with four banners with inscriptions such as "Overcoming the Famine" and "Production Pioneer". At present, all the villagers are fully engaged in spring planting.
