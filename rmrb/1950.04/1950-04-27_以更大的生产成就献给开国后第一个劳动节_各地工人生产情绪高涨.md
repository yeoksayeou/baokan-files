Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Workers across the country are launching production emulation campaigns of varying scales to welcome the first "May Day" International Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Many cities will also hold labor model conferences on "May Day," or continue to carry out competitions, to further increase production.

	North China
	In North China, most state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi have launched production emulation campaigns in conjunction with the movement to establish production quotas. After the Taiyuan Revitalization Machinery Factory launched the competition, the daily output of waterwheels has more than doubled the original plan. The battery department of the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau reformed the lead plate casting model, increasing production efficiency by nearly sixteen times. The city's Federation of Trade Unions has decided to hold the city's first labor model conference on "May Day." The Datong Pingwang Power Plant has seen a continuous stream of new production records in the past half month. Workers in the machinist group completed a task that originally required thirty-six hours in nine hours. The work efficiency of the ironworker group in making screws has also increased by 42% compared to before. Several factories and enterprises in Tianjin have also enthusiastically launched production emulation campaigns. The Railway Bureau's rolling stock inspection section plans to overhaul two passenger trains, naming them "May Day" trains. The Third Power Plant will ensure the safe power supply of Boiler No. 12 to welcome "May Day." The Motor Transport Company plans to strive to complete this month's driving task of 130,000 kilometers by the end of the month. The city has also decided to launch a large-scale production emulation campaign for three months starting on "May Day" to improve output and quality, reduce costs, and further improve production management and business methods in conjunction with rationalization proposals. The main content of Beijing's "May Day" commemoration is to step up production and relieve unemployed workers. Workers at the tram repair factory are preparing to repair car No. 501, in addition to completing this month's plan, and name it "May Day" Labor Car. Workers at the Ruizi Mine in the Heishan Mine in Mentougou, Beijing, have challenged other mines, guaranteeing to strengthen safety work and prevent any casualties. The "Labor People's Cultural Palace" being prepared by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions will officially open on "May Day." The Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions in Chahar also held a production emulation mobilization meeting. At the meeting, Longyan Iron Mine decided that in addition to completing this month's production plan, it would also guarantee to increase the quality by 40%. The output of the machinery factory has greatly increased this month. For example, the daily output of fish tail screws has increased from more than 150 in March to 940. The output of gunpowder in the gunpowder factory has also increased by more than 50%. The engineering section of Zhangjiakou Water Company plans to complete the second quarter's production tasks in two months.

	East China
	In East China, all employees of the Shanghai Railway Bureau are determined to guarantee the overfulfillment of the second quarter's production tasks. The gift from the workers of the transportation section to Red May is to strive to complete 400,000 kilometers of transportation tasks. The P51-101 crew of the locomotive section has signed a teaching and mutual aid contract, striving to have no liability accidents within three months, and guaranteeing safe travel of 70,000 kilometers and extension of the Class A inspection period. The error rate of telegrams at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has decreased by 60% compared to March. At the beginning of this month, the underground coal production rate of No. 5 well in the Datong Mine of the Huainan Coal Mine has increased by 53%. Workers of the Jinan Railway Administration engaged in the repair project of the Huaihe River Iron Bridge unanimously proposed to strive to repair the iron bridge and start traffic on "May Day." The Jinan Power Plant decided to install the No. 6 boiler that was dismantled during the Japanese occupation before "May Day." Workers of the Xuzhou Engineering Section of the Jinpu Railway automatically increased the task of repairing roads according to the new road maintenance method from 5 meters to 7 meters per day. The "May Day" emulation campaign of Qingdao Qilu Company began in mid-March. The output of sprayed rubber pipes in the affiliated rubber factory has increased by 41% compared to the past; it completed the production task at the end of May on the 15th of this month.

	Northwest
	Even the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu, far in the northwest, has launched a large-scale production emulation campaign. The mine's repair shop plans to repair eleven scrapped vehicles to welcome "May Day." Workers in the riveting factory and power plant of the machinery department are rushing to manufacture a 500-horsepower boiler and repair motors and transformers. Workers in the oil refinery are striving to start producing engine oil on "May Day." The production efficiency of the copper casting class in making sand molds for large shaft copper tiles has reached five times that before liberation. Workers of the Chang'an Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Bureau have saved 63% of the planned coal consumption in the intense work of completing this month's plan. While stepping up production, workers in various factories of the Northwest Logistics Department's military supplies department have also launched a surge of political study.

	Northeast
	The Northeast Railway Administration and the Railway Federation of Trade Unions have decided to hold a railway labor model conference in Harbin on "May Day" and hold an exhibition of labor model photos, honorary products, and model parts of inventions. The Lushun-Dalian Bulb Factory is further strengthening the relationship between masters and apprentices to welcome "May Day." The Harbin Engineering Section has universally launched the signing of master-apprentice contracts, so that 100 new workers can master basic techniques before "May Day." The Tumen Train Section's Iron Bull Team and Victory Team decided to use the achievement of "one million kilometers without accidents" as a "May Day" gift (the team safely traveled more than 748,500 kilometers in 439 days before March 5).

	Central and South
	In the Central and South Region, all trade union members of the Kaifeng Railway Repair Factory decided to use actions to transform tools and improve production to welcome "May Day." They also plan to strive to complete the annual production task three months or even four months ahead of schedule. Workers at the Hengyang Locomotive Depot want to use their spare time to repair a locomotive before "May Day."
