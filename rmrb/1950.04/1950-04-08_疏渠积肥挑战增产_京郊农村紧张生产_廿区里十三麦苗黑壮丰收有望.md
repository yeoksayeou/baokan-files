After villages in the Fourteenth District of Beijing suburbs held Party and League member meetings, farmer representative meetings, farmer group meetings, and mass meetings to repeatedly implement production policies and the direction of striving for a 10% increase in production, farmers' production enthusiasm has greatly increased. Many Party members, League members, and farmer representatives have made their own production increase plans. Yilezhuang has made a village-wide production increase plan. The village has 9,000 mu of cultivated land. In the past, the Feng River within its borders flooded nine years out of ten. After dredging and repairing this year, it can be guaranteed to be free from floods. Farmer representatives Yu Chaokai and Qi Donghai estimate that this river dredging can increase grain production by 3 dou per mu. Farmers are pooling the farm tools they received during the land reform and are working together. Therefore, the whole village challenged Yinghaizhuang with the conditions: not a single mu of land should be left uncultivated, and no one should be idle, achieving a 20% increase in production. They also asked farmers from Yinghaizhuang to come and check at any time; and pointed out that the fact that fewer women in Yinghaizhuang were going to the fields was a major drawback. Farmers in Yinghaizhuang were even more enthusiastic, saying: Let's compete and see what happens in the fall! Some immediately guaranteed that their women would go to the fields. Yinghaizhuang added ten earth wells last year, and the village has 41 waterwheels and 170 head of livestock. Last autumn, they planted more than 5,000 mu of autumn wheat (normally only 2,000 mu are planted), and this year they plan to plant 2,424 mu of cotton (last year they planted 1,100 mu of cotton), and open up 40 mu of wasteland. Agricultural association cadres Ji Linchen and Meng Jisheng proposed to guarantee a 20% increase in production. Farmers in Paifang reported: This year, our village has three "mores": more kidney beans and barley planted; more black soil ditch mud pulled; and more people going to the fields. Farmer representative Xue Yongchang from Huaifang village plans to open three mu of paddy fields this year, and has already opened more than one mu and dug an earth well. After explaining the production policy, some rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants have begun to hire laborers. Rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants in Yinghaizhuang have hired eleven workers. In Shiba Li Dian, there are already three households hiring laborers. Now, under the direct help of district cadres, each village is holding a forum for employers. (Zhao Youfu)

Xinhua News Agency. Farmers in the Sixteenth District of Beijing suburbs, in the four villages of Liulangzhuang, Bagou, Haidian, and Xiyuan, received a total of 4,849 mu of paddy fields during the land reform. The paddy fields in this area mainly rely on two drainage channels - the East Hao Ditch and the West Hao Ditch. Because they had not been dredged for the past 20 years, the drainage was not smooth, and floods often occurred. This year, the emancipated farmers unanimously requested to dredge these two channels. After consultation and discussion among the four villages, it was decided to divide the work and cooperate, first dredging the East Hao Ditch. The entire project was divided into four major sections. On April 1st, a total of more than 910 farmers were mobilized to participate. The Youth League members of Liulangzhuang also launched a tree planting campaign at the same time, planting 365 trees in one day. Women League members were responsible for boiling and delivering water. The entire project was completed in one day.

On April 4th, Liulangzhuang village mobilized more than 470 farmers to start dredging the West Hao Ditch again, and more than 20 young women also voluntarily asked to go into the water to dig the ditch. The entire West Hao Ditch was also dredged within one day. The two channels are a total of five li long, and the channels were widened and deepened by an average of two chi each, so that water can flow unhindered even in heavy rain, ensuring that 510 mu of paddy fields are not flooded.

The Nineteenth District of Beijing is organizing farmers to pull ditch mud. In order to solve the transportation difficulties, the cooperative is using agricultural loans to organize transportation. First, each village determines appropriate transportation fees. Those who need fertilizer can register with the cooperative, and the cooperative will organize the carts willing to pull ditch mud and transport it to the registered households in a planned way. For each cart pulled, the cooperative pays the cart household the stipulated fee, which is counted as a loan to the registered household. Another method is: farmers who need fertilizer loans obtain loan slips from the cooperative, and then find their own carts. The cart households pull back the ditch mud, obtain the slips from the loan households, and then go to the cooperative to collect the money. Through such organization, the fertilizer and transportation problems are solved, and it is guaranteed that the loans are used for production. Before the organization, 828 carts had been pulled back, and after the organization, another 347 carts were pulled. Now there are 980 carts registered waiting to be pulled.

In the Thirteenth Area of the Twentieth District of Beijing suburbs, wheat seedlings are black and strong, and a rich harvest is expected, and the farmers' spirits are extremely high. The village has planted a total of 1,306.7 mu of autumn wheat, most of which have been harrowed once, and the farmers are preparing to apply top dressing.

Also, farmers in Nanxinfang and Wangpo villages in the Thirteenth Area are solving spring plowing and sowing problems through production and self-rescue. In the past, some farmers had the idea of relying on government grain loans. After the work team explained and persuaded them, they actively developed sideline production. Nanxinfang organized manpower and animal power. People cut firewood on the mountains and animals hauled it to Liangxiang to sell. Every 100 jin of firewood was exchanged for 20 jin of sweet potatoes. From the 20th to the 28th of last month, a total of 16,000 jin of firewood was sold, exchanging for 3,200 jin of sweet potatoes. Wangpo Village hauls firewood to Xiaoyao in Mentougou to sell, exchanging 100 jin for 7 jin of millet, and can earn 80 jin of millet per day. With capital, farmers are stepping up production, and slope land has now been sown.

　　疏渠积肥挑战增产
    京郊农村紧张生产
    廿区里十三麦苗黑壮丰收有望
    【本报讯】京郊十四区各村召开党团员会、农民代表会，农民小组会，群众大会反复贯彻生产政策及为增产一成而努力的方向后，农民生产情绪大为提高，很多党、团员及农民代表都作出自己的增产计划。怡乐庄已作出全村增产计划。该村共有耕地九千亩。过去境内凤河十年九涝，今年挖修后，可以保证不受水灾。农民代表于朝凯、齐东海估计：这一挖河，每亩地可增产三斗粮食。农民将在土地改革中分到的农具搭起帮来，拨工互助。因此全村向瀛海庄提出了挑战，条件是：不荒一亩地，不闲一个人。作到增产二成。并要求瀛海庄农民可以随时来检查；并指出瀛海庄妇女下地干活的少是一大缺点。瀛海庄农民劲更大，说：比赛吧，秋后看！有的当下就保证自家的妇女下地。瀛海庄去年增加了十眼土井，全村有四十一辆水车，一百七十头牲口。去年秋天种秋麦五千多亩（常年只种两千亩），今年计划种棉花二千四百二十四亩（去年种棉花一千一百亩），并开四十亩荒地。农会干部冀林臣、孟继生提出一定保证作到增产二成。牌坊农民反映：今年我们村有三多：种的芸豆、大麦多；拉的黑土沟泥多；下地干活的人多。槐房村农民代表薛永昌，今年计划开三亩稻田，现在已开了一亩多，并打一眼土井。经过讲解生产政策后，有些富农及富裕中农已开始雇工。瀛海庄富农及富裕中农已雇了十一个工。十八里店已有三户雇工。现在各村正在区干部的直接帮助下开雇主座谈会。（赵有福）
    【本报讯】京郊十六区六郎庄、巴沟、海甸、西苑四村土地改革中农民共得到稻田四千八百四十九亩。这一带的稻田主要是依靠两条泄水渠——东壕沟，西壕沟，因过去二十年来总没有疏浚过，泄水不畅，常常发生涝灾。今年，翻身农民一致要求疏通这两条渠道。四个村协商讨论后，决定分工合作，先疏通东壕沟。全部工程分四大段进行。四月一日共发动农民九百一十余人参加。六郎庄的青年团员也同时展开了植树运动，一天就种了三百六十五棵。妇女团员担任烧水送水的工作。全部工程一天便突击完成。
    四月四日六郎庄一村又发动四百七十余农民开始疏通西壕沟，二十多个青年妇女，也自动要求下水挖渠。全部西壕沟一天之内也疏通完毕。两渠共长五里，渠道开宽挖深平均各二尺，下大雨也可水流无阻，保证了五百一十亩稻田不被水淹。

    【本报讯】京十九区正组织农民拉沟泥。为了解决运输上的困难，合作社即利用农业贷款组织运输，首先各村定出适当的运输费用。需要肥料的可向合作社登记，合作社再把愿拉沟泥的大车组织起来，有计划地去拉，拉回以后送到登记的各户。每拉一车，合作社付给大车户规定的费用，此费即算作贷款借给登记户。还有一种办法是：需要肥料贷款的农民取得合作社的贷款条子以后，自己去找大车，大车户拉回沟泥，从贷款户取得条子再到合作社去领款。经过这样组织，既解决了肥料、运输问题，又保证了贷款用于生产。该村在未组织前已拉回八百二十八车，组织后又拉了三百四十七车，现在登记待拉的已有九百八十车。

    【本报讯】京郊二十区里十三麦苗黑壮，丰收有望，农民情绪极高。该村共种秋麦一千三百零六亩七分，大部都用钯子耧了一回，农民正准备施追肥。
    【又讯】里十三南辛坊、王坡两村农民生产自救解决春耕播种问题。过去一部分农民有依赖政府贷粮的思想，经工作组解释说服后，便积极开展副业生产。南辛坊组织了人力、畜力，人由山上割柴，牲口拉往良乡去卖，每百斤柴换白薯二十斤，由上月二十日至二十八日共卖柴一万六千斤，换回白薯三千二百斤。王坡村打柴往门头沟小窑去卖，每百斤换七斤小米，每天可收入八十斤小米。有了资本以后，农民正加紧生产，现在坡地已经下种。
