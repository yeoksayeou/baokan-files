　　By January of this year, the leaders of the Chahar Military Region discovered this destructive behavior. When investigating responsibility, the Guard 2nd Regiment began to realize the seriousness of the error. The regiment has conducted self-criticism from top to bottom and requested punishment and compensation for the losses. The self-criticism pointed out that the causes of this error were: (1) The regiment headquarters had serious bureaucracy. After the incident occurred, the regiment's leading cadres failed to go deep into the companies to promptly check and correct it. In early October, when they discovered that several units were cutting firewood on Ci'er Mountain, they only stopped it by telephone and in writing, and did not check whether the companies had implemented the instructions. (2) The regiment's leading cadres and cadres at all levels, as well as the entire unit, had very poor organizational discipline, policy awareness, and law-abiding spirit. Usually, the policy and legal education for cadres was not thorough, and they did not connect with reality to improve the policy thinking of cadres and soldiers. (3) Some cadres and soldiers had a strong backward peasant consciousness, disregarding the overall situation and lacking an overall concept. In order to burn kang and solve a little firewood, they disregarded national construction. (4) The regiment headquarters did not strictly manage the troops, thinking that the troops had undergone training such as party rectification and discipline rectification, and "generally would not commit any discipline violations," which caused the error to develop to a serious degree. (5) Lack of serious ideological struggle. The regiment's leading cadres rarely launched planned struggles against the bad tendencies of the troops, and mostly adopted individual education methods. The atmosphere of mutual criticism in the troops was very poor.
    In the self-criticism report, the regiment requested the Chahar Military Region and the government to impose strict punishment, and was willing to publish the mistakes in the newspapers, admit the mistakes to the people, and apologize. At the same time, it stated that in addition to being determined to correct the mistakes, strengthen the policy and discipline education of the troops, and improve organization and discipline, it would also take practical actions to compensate the people's losses: (1) The government will design the restoration project of Ci'er Mountain, and the regiment will guarantee to plant 20,000 trees; (2) Guarantee to complete this year's large-scale production tasks and build barracks by themselves, saving national financial expenditures; (3) Resolutely complete the guard tasks, protect all national construction and forests in Zhangjiakou, and especially take responsibility for guarding Ci'er Mountain to prevent any further destruction.

　　从上而下严格检讨并保证植树两万株
    到今年一月，察哈尔军区首长发觉这一破坏行为，追究责任时，该警卫二团才开始认识到错误的严重性。该团已从上而下的进行检讨，并请求处分与补偿损失。检讨中指出造成这一错误的原因是：（一）团部存在着严重的官僚主义。事件发生后，团的领导干部未能深入连队，及时检查纠正，十月初发觉几个单位到赐儿山砍柴，只在电话上和从文字上加以制止，也没有检查各连队是否执行了指示。（二）团领导干部及各级干部和整个部队，组织纪律、政策观念和守法精神很差，平时对干部的政策、法令教育不深入，没有联系实际提高干部、战士的政策思想。（三）部分干部、战士存在着浓厚的农民落后意识，不顾大局，缺乏整体观念。为了烧炕，解决一点柴火，就不顾国家的建设。（四）团部对部队管理不严，以为部队经过了整党、整顿纪律等锻炼，“一般地不会犯什么纪律”，致使错误发展到严重地步。（五）缺乏严肃的思想斗争。团领导干部很少对部队的不良倾向有计划的展开斗争，多采取个别教育的方法，部队中互相批评的风气很差。
    该团于检讨报告中，要求察哈尔军区和政府给予严格的处罚，并愿把所犯错误在报纸上公布，向人民承认错误与道歉。同时表示：除决心改正错误，加强部队的政策、纪律教育、提高组织性与纪律性外，并以实际行动来补偿人民的损失：（一）由政府设计赐儿山的恢复工程，该团保证植种两万棵树；（二）保证完成今年的大生产任务。自己建设营房，节省国家财政开支。（三）坚决完成警备任务，保护张市的一切国家建设和林木，特别要经常尽责看守赐儿山，不让再遭任何破坏。
