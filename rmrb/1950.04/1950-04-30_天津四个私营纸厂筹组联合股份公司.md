Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 28th: To overcome difficulties in capital and sales, four private paper mills in Tianjin, namely Xingxing, Bohai, Zhongxing, and Fuxing, have decided to merge operations. The "Tianjin United Paper Manufacturing Joint Stock Company" planned to be established, was approved by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce on the 25th of this month to set up a preparatory office, and began to carry out asset liquidation, debt repayment, and business planning.

In recent years, the above-mentioned four factories have been unable to actively expand investment by the capitalists, relying entirely on loans to maintain production, resulting in heavy debts. In addition, the machinery and equipment of each factory are not perfect, and they can only produce kraft paper, cardboard, match paper, and thin colored paper. Moreover, the raw materials are mostly waste cotton and rags, and the product quality is very low, which is not suitable for cultural paper needs, resulting in sluggish product sales and serious difficulties in capital turnover. The four factories currently owe a total of 2.5 billion yuan in loans to state-owned banks and private banks, and there are also 614.4 million yuan in unpaid water and electricity bills and employee salaries. As a result, the Bohai and Fuxing factories have completely stopped production; Zhongxing has also partially stopped production.

In response to this serious situation, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has repeatedly explained to the capitalists of each factory that the papermaking industry has a promising future, and the basic issue to solving the current difficulties is how to invest capital, add machinery and equipment, and change the direction of production. At the same time, the workers of Xingxing and other factories took the initiative to propose salary reductions to the factory management, and vigorously practiced thrift and economy, working together to reduce costs, and ensuring to improve product quality, thereby increasing the capitalists' confidence in operation. After specific research, the capitalists of each factory decided to concentrate all the capital and machinery and equipment of the four factories, merge operations, and form the "Tianjin United Paper Manufacturing Joint Stock Company," and planned to absorb 8 billion yuan in new shares for repaying part of the debts that urgently need to be cleared and for working capital. In addition, preparations are being made to streamline production organization and unnecessary personnel, reduce expenses, avoid waste, and adjust the machinery and equipment of each factory in order to mass-produce cultural paper and restore normal production. For example, the Zhongxing Paper Mill originally had 313 horsepower of power, but only 250 horsepower was actually used, and the excess power can be uniformly allocated. The Bohai Paper Mill's No. 2 machine can manufacture newsprint, but in the past, due to insufficient capital, it has not been installed. Now, allocating the excess drying cylinders from the Xingxing Paper Mill can produce newsprint.

Currently, the preparatory office of the company has signed a contract with the Tianjin People's Bank to purchase waste banknotes in order to solve the raw material problem, and is preparing to produce general cultural paper to supply social needs.

### 天津四个私营纸厂筹组联合股份公司

　　天津四个私营纸厂筹组联合股份公司
    【新华社天津二十八日电】津市私营星星、渤海、中兴、复兴等四纸厂，为克服资金、销路的困难，决定合并经营。所筹组的“天津联合造纸股份有限公司”，本月二十五日已经市工商局批准设立筹备处，开始进行资产清理、偿还债务与计划推行业务等工作。
    上述四厂年来由于资方未能积极扩充投资，完全依赖贷款来维持生产，负债很多；加以各厂机器设备不够完善，只能生产牛皮、硬纸板、火柴纸与片艳纸等，且原料多为废棉与破布，产品质量甚低，不适于文化用纸需要，以致造成产品滞销，资金周转发生严重困难。现四厂共欠国家银行与私营行庄借款竟达二十五亿元，此外未支付的水电费与职工薪资尚有六亿一千四百余万元。因而渤海、复兴两厂目前已全部停工；中兴也部分停工。
    针对此严重情况，市工商局数度对各厂资方说明造纸业是有前途的，解决目前困难的基本问题，是如何投入资金，增添机器设备，改变生产方向。同时，星星等厂职工并主动向厂方提出减薪，并厉行节约，协力使成本减低，并保证提高产品质量，因而提高了资方的经营信心。各厂资方经具体研究结果，决定集中四厂所有资金和机器设备，合并经营，组成“天津联合造纸股份有限公司”，并拟吸入新股八十亿元，作为偿还目前急待清理的部分债务与流动资金之用；此外，并准备精简生产组织与不必要的人员，减缩开支，避免浪费，调整各厂的机器设备，以便大量生产文化用纸，以恢复正常生产。如中兴纸厂原有三百十三匹马力的动力，实际只用二百五十匹，多余电力即可统一调配。渤海纸厂二号机能制造新闻纸，但过去因资本不够，迄未按装，现调配星星纸厂多余的烘缸即可生产新闻纸。
    现该公司筹备处为解决原料问题，已与津市人民银行签订购买废钞合同，准备生产一般文化用纸，供应社会需要。
