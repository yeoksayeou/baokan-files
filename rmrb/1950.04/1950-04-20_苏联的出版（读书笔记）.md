Soviet Publishing (Reading Notes)
    Yijun
    These are notes written by the author after reading the book "Soviet Publishing" and the article "Further Raise the Ideological Level of Publishing Work." The content is quite useful for China's publishers and editors, so it is specially submitted to Book Review for publication. The original author of "Soviet Publishing" is Markus, published by Shanghai Times Publishing House. "Further Raise the Ideological Level of Publishing Work" is an editorial from the "Truth Daily," published in the first collection of "Cultural and Educational Reference Materials" compiled and printed by the Central Committee for Culture and Education.

    Soviet publishing is a powerful weapon for the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government to organize the people and carry out communist education for the people, and a powerful weapon for the Party and the government to build a socialist society.

    Soviet publishing has become the true property of the working people, serving the people and expressing their interests and opinions. Soviet publishing is democratic and understandable to all nationalities in the Soviet Union. It exists in Russian and the languages of various nationalities. Publishing in capitalist countries, however, mainly serves the propertied class.

    The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) once instructed the Soviet Publishing Bureau: The Soviet Union "must arm the broadest masses of socialist builders with the Marxist-Leninist theory and technical production knowledge. Books must be the most powerful weapon for educating, mobilizing, and organizing the masses around economic and cultural construction work. The quality of books must meet the increasingly high cultural demands of the masses."

    Freedom of the press is one of the basic and inalienable freedoms of mankind. However, if the working class and the laboring masses have not seized power and have not concentrated all the material foundations guaranteeing freedom of the press in their own hands, then true freedom of the press for the working class and the laboring masses is, in fact, impossible.

    The people's freedom of the press is affirmed in the basic law of the Soviet state—the Constitution. The Constitution stipulates: "In accordance with the interests of the working people and in order to consolidate the socialist system, citizens of the USSR are guaranteed by law: A, freedom of speech; B, freedom of the press; C, freedom of assembly; D, freedom of street processions and demonstrations. The guarantee of these freedoms for citizens is provided by placing at the disposal of the working people and their organizations printing presses, supplies, public buildings, the streets, communication facilities and other material conditions necessary for their exercise."

    Bolshevik publishing work is the most democratic in the world. It completely serves the interests of the people and completely serves the working people.

    Bourgeois publishing in capitalist countries, however, serves other purposes. Bourgeois newspapers and magazines can fully defend the insatiable interests of the exploiters of capitalist monopoly capital. The meaning of "freedom of the press" in capitalist countries is the freedom to incite hostility between people of all countries, to carry out racial discrimination propaganda, and is merely the freedom to attack the basic democratic rights of the working people to satisfy the selfish desires of imperialist reactionaries.

    In capitalist countries, the working people do not have the necessary conditions to actually implement freedom of speech and the press. "Everywhere in the world where capitalists exist, freedom of the press... is the freedom to buy and fabricate public opinion favorable to the bourgeoisie" (Lenin). The material foundation of publishing—printing presses, paper, etc.—is almost entirely owned by large capitalists with a few publishing enterprises, who control all newspapers and publishing undertakings in their hands to achieve their reactionary imperialist desires.

    In the Soviet Union, publishing is divided according to various types of nature, that is to say, each Soviet publishing institution mostly publishes one type of book: political or artistic, agricultural, medical, etc. Therefore, in the Soviet Union there are: the State Political Books Publishing Bureau, the State Art Books Publishing Bureau, the State Agricultural Books Publishing Bureau, and the State Medical Books Publishing Bureau, etc.

    In the Soviet Union, books have become the wealth of the broad masses of working people. In the Tsarist era (according to publishing materials from 1913), there were an average of about 0.7 books per resident, while in the Soviet Union in 1939, 4.1 books were published per resident, which increased sixfold.

    From 1918 to 1946, the Soviet Union published 859,000 types of books, with a total circulation of 10.7 billion copies.

    Soviet books are published in 119 languages. Many nationalities of the Soviet Union are now publishing a huge number of books and pamphlets in their own languages, which they did not have before the great October Socialist Revolution.

    One of the indicators of the cultural development of the Soviet people lies not only in the increase in the number of books printed, but also in the increase in the variety and improvement of the quality of books.

    Truthfulness, persuasiveness, simplicity, and a high degree of ideological content are the characteristics of Soviet publishing. And these characteristics are a reflection of the inherent characteristics of the Soviet people. This explains to us the organic and inseparable relationship between Soviet publishing and its own people. Publications enjoy the greatest prestige and trust among the Soviet people.

    A high degree of ideological and political content, bold principled criticism of the shortcomings of social and government institutions, and close daily and continuous contact with the masses—have established the lofty prestige of Soviet publishing among the Soviet people.

    The growth of the political and cultural level of Soviet readers places increasingly higher demands on Soviet publishing. People will evaluate every step of their (referring to publishing institutions) activities based on whether the books they publish are good. Therefore, for book publishing workers, there is no greater glory than publishing books that can meet the growing demands of Soviet readers.

    Soviet readers often express their opinions to newspapers and magazines in letters, demanding that publishing institutions that distribute ideological waste paper establish a working system. Considering these legitimate demands and quickly correcting organizational shortcomings in publishing work is one of the most important tasks of leaders of publishing institutions.

    To turn publishing institutions into ideological fortresses, it is necessary to strengthen and continuously improve the editorial departments.

    Publishing and editorial work require a great love for the cause undertaken, creativity, and an unwavering determination to improve the ideological level of every publishing colleague. Publishing workers must always keep the Soviet reader—a smart, studious, tenacious, enthusiastic book lover, and an active builder of communist society—in mind. Soviet publishers must also take care that millions of our country's foreign friends, especially friends in people's democratic countries, are eagerly watching every new Soviet book. A good Soviet book is a teacher and nurturer of the people, revealing the great realm of communism to readers.

    The first step for publishing institutions is to review the manuscripts submitted by authors and make a preliminary criticism. The future destiny of this book depends in many ways on how principled and skilled this review and criticism are. It is not permissible to let principled criticism unknowingly be tainted with a lenient attitude and factional implications. Practice has repeatedly proven that wherever there is no careful and sharp critical review of books accepted for publication, wherever there is no attention to what the author has written, what he has expressed, and what his ideological stance is, there will be the publication of unthinking, anti-scientific, and anti-artistic works.

    Soviet readers often give serious corrections to the book reviews made by publishing institutions, and give publishing institutions useful advice for future work. Experience shows that if publishing institutions want to publish high-quality books, they should respect readers' opinions and consult with readers.

　　苏联的出版（读书笔记）
    逸君
    这是笔者读《苏联的出版》一书和《再提高出版工作的思想水平》一文后所写的笔记，因为内容颇可供我国的出版业者和编辑工作者参考，特地投寄图书评论发表。《苏联的出版》一书，原著者是马尔库斯，上海时代出版社刊行。“再提高出版工作的思想水平”是《真理报》社论，载中央文教委员会编印的“文教参考资料”第一集。
    苏联的出版，是苏联共产党和苏联政府组织人民和对人民设施共产主义教育的强大武器，是党和政府建设社会主义社会的强大武器。
    苏联的出版成了劳动人民的真正财产，它为人民服务，表达他们的利益和意见。苏联的出版是民主的，也是苏联一切民族都能理解的。他有俄文，也有各民族的文字。资本主义国家的出版却主要为有产阶级服务。
    联共（布）党曾经给苏联的出版局指示：苏联“必须以马列主义理论和技术生产的知识武装最广大的群众——社会主义建设者。书籍必须是教育、动员并组织群众环绕在经济和文化建设工作的周围的最强大的武器。书籍的素质必须符合群众日益高涨的文化要求。”
    出版自由是人类基本的不可分割的自由之一。但是工人阶级和劳动群众如果没有取得政权，没有将保证出版自由的全部物质基础集中在自己手里，那么为工人阶级和劳动群众的真正的出版自由，在事实上是不可能的。
    人民的出版自由，在苏联国家的基本法律——宪法——中是被确认了的。宪法订定：“为符合劳动人民的利益并为巩固社会主义制度起见，由法律保障苏联公民享有：甲、言论自由，乙、出版自由，丙、集会自由，丁，游行及示威自由。公民前项自由之保证，为印刷所、纸张、公共场所、街道、电信工具以及其他一切用以实现此项权利所必要的物质条件，均供劳动者及其团体使用。”
    布尔什维克的出版工作——是世界上最民主的。它完全服从人民的利益，完全为劳动人民服务。
    资本主义国家的布尔乔亚的出版，却服从另外一些目的。布尔乔亚的报纸、杂志完全可保卫资本主义独占资本的剥削者的贪得无厌的利益。资本主义国家的“新闻自由”的意义是煽动各国人民之间的敌意，进行种族歧视宣传的自由，只是攻击劳动人民基本民主权利以满足帝国主义反动派私欲的自由。
    在资本主义国家里，劳动人民是没有事实上实施言论和出版自由的必要条件的。“全世界，凡是存在着资本家的地方，出版自由……就是收买和制造对布尔乔亚有利的舆论的自由”（列宁）。出版的物质基础——印刷所、纸张等——几乎为少数出版企业的大资本家所有，在他们的手中掌握了所有的报纸和出版事业，以遂其反动帝国主义的愿望。
    在苏联，出版事业是按照各类性质进行分工的，那就是说每一个苏联出版机关大部分是出版一种书籍：政治或艺术、农业、医学等。因此，在苏联有：国立政治书籍出版局、国立艺术书籍出版局、国立农业书籍出版局及国立医学书籍出版局等。
    在苏联，书籍已成为广大劳动人民群众的财富。在沙皇时代（据一九一三年出版材料统计），每一居民平均约有书○·七册，在一九三九年的苏联，为每一居民出版了四·一册书，这就增加了六倍。
    在一九一八——一九四六年中，苏联出版了八十五万九千种书，销数共达一百零七亿册。
    苏联的书籍用一百十九种文字出版。苏联的许多民族，现在用自己的文字出版着数量庞大的书籍和小册子，在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，他们是没有自己的文字的。
    苏联人民文化发展的指标之一，不仅在于书籍印数的增加，而且也在于它种类的增多和质量的改进。
    真实、具有说服性、质朴、高度的思想性，是苏联出版的特征。而这些特征，正是苏联人民固有特色的反映。这一点对我们说明了苏联的出版和自己人民的有机的、不可割裂的关系。出版物在苏联人民中享有最大的威望和信任。
    高度的思想性、政治性，对社会和政府机构活动的缺点，作大胆的原则上的批评，与群众紧密的每日不断的联系——树立了苏联的出版在苏联人民中间的崇高威信。
    苏联读者政治和文化水平的增长，就对苏联的出版提出日益增高的要求。它们（指出版机构）事业活动的每一步，人们将依据它们出版的书好不好来加以评价。因此，就书籍出版工作者说来，没有比出版能够满足苏维埃读者日益增长的要求的书籍更光荣了。
    苏联读者常常用书信向报纸和杂志提出意见，在书信中要求那些发行思想上的废纸的出版机构建立工作制度。考虑这些正当要求，迅速改正出版工作在组织上的缺点，乃是出版机构领导者最重要的任务之一。
    要把出版机构变成思想的堡垒，必须加强和不断改进编辑部。
    出版、编辑工作要求对所负担事业有巨大的热爱，要求创造性，要求不屈不挠地提高每个出版同人的思想水平。出版工作者必需时时刻刻把苏维埃读者——聪明的，好学的，顽强的，热情的书籍爱好者，共产主义社会的积极建设者，放在眼前。苏维埃出版者也必须照顾到，我们祖国成百万的国外朋友、特别是人民民主国家的朋友，望眼欲穿地注视着苏联的每本新书。一本好的苏维埃的书，乃是人民的教师和培育者，它向读者揭示着共产主义的伟大境界。
    出版机构第一步审订作者所交出的原稿，加以初步的批评。这种审订和这种批评的原则性和熟练的程度如何，这本书的将来命运在许多方面有赖于此。不可以让原则的批判不知不觉染上讲情面的态度和派系的意味。实践一再证明，凡是对于接受出版的书没有慎重的和尖锐批评的审查的地方，凡是没有注意作者写的什么，他表现的什么，他的思想立场怎样的地方，那里便把缺乏思想的、反科学的、反艺术的作品公诸于世了。
    苏联读者常常对出版机构所作的书籍评定给予严重的纠正，给予出版机构未来工作以有益的忠告。经验指明，如果出版机构希望出版高度品质的书，他就应该尊重读者的意见，和读者商量。
