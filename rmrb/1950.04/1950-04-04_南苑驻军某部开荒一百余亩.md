A Unit of the Nanyuan Garrison Reclaims Over One Hundred Mu of Wasteland

[This Newspaper Despatch] Over one hundred and fifty soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Nanyuan, south of Beijing, are participating in agricultural production. Recently, they have reclaimed 120 mu of wasteland, and the vegetable plots have been turned over three times. In addition, they have dug out over one hundred large tree roots, yielding approximately two thousand catties of rough firewood. All the soldiers are eager to prove themselves and strive to achieve merit on the production front. They are currently preparing to dig wells, transport manure, and plant early vegetables.
