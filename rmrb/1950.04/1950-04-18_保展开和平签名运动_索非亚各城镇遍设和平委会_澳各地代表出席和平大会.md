　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Combined TASS and Telepress dispatches report: A campaign to collect signatures for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace Permanent Committee's appeal has been launched throughout Bulgaria. Under the call of the Bulgarian Committee for the Defense of Peace, thousands of towns, villages, enterprises, and organizations have established committees for the defense of peace and held gatherings to collect signatures for the Great Peace Appeal. Factories and organizations are also organizing special workdays in support of peace, combining the struggle for peace with the May Day competition. In Sofia alone, 1,300 committees for the defense of peace have been established. The city of Rom held a grand gathering of peace supporters. Clergy throughout the Bulgarian Republic are also actively participating in the peace movement.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th: TASS Melbourne, 15th: Representatives from various parts of Australia and overseas arrived here on the 14th and 15th to attend the Australian Peace Conference. The conference will open here on the 16th in the form of a mass rally. When the Deputy Dean of Canterbury, England, Johnson, arrived in Melbourne, he was welcomed by hundreds of representatives from the people, trade unions, youth, women, religious, and other groups. Many people came with their families, holding signs reading "Peace-lovers welcome the Deputy Dean," "We want peace," and small blue flags depicting white doves—symbols of peace.
　　On his way to Melbourne, Johnson briefly met with reporters in Darwin and Sydney, saying: "I don't believe war is inevitable, and I am completely optimistic about the world situation. There are people in some countries who hold warlike purposes, but the people of these countries do not want to start a war."
