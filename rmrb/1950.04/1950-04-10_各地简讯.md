　　Sichuan

　　When a certain unit of the PLA of the Eastern Sichuan Military Region was carrying out bandit suppression operations in Bishan, Tongliang and other places, the local farmers actively guided the troops, reported bandit activities, and organized transportation teams to transport ammunition and food for the combat troops. More than 30 farmers from Xiemachang in Baxian County, 60 miles away, also rushed to participate in the transportation work upon hearing the news. When the remnant bandits of Huang Rongqing's bandit gang in Bishan fled into a mountain cave in an attempt to resist stubbornly, the local stonemasons immediately rushed to help the troops chisel the mountain, forcing the remnant bandits to surrender to us. Many men and women villagers even personally brought pork, eggs, and tea to the front line to comfort the troops. When the bandits in the area were completely wiped out and the bandit leaders were captured alive, the local residents became even more enthusiastic. Villages were plastered with victory slogans, and tea was brewed and cannons were fired to welcome the bandit suppression troops. The farmers in Tianshui Township, Xindu, Western Sichuan, even took the initiative to assist the township troops, so that more than 60 bandits hiding near the township were all caught. With the comprehensive launch of bandit suppression work in Southwest China, people in various places have also begun to organize local armed forces, proposing the slogan of "preventing bandits and producing," actively assisting and cooperating with the troops in suppressing bandits. People's armed forces in Fengdu, Baxian, Ziyang, Tongliang and other places have been organized one after another. In addition to actively cooperating with the main force in bandit suppression battles, they also help the troops send intelligence, act as guides, monitor the sabotage activities of local reactionaries, expose the rumors of secret agents, protect granaries, and establish a system of day and night patrols and sentry posts to protect local farmers from carrying out spring ploughing production in a timely manner.

　　Xikang

　　After the People's Liberation Army Xikang Military Region troops entered Ya'an, they focused on suppressing bandits in Ya'an, Lushan, Tianquan and other places. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2,000 bandits were wiped out in nearly a month of bandit suppression operations from February 21 to March 19. Now, in the areas where the remaining Hu bandits have been eliminated, farmers have generally begun spring ploughing, and the rural mass work in the Ya'an area has gradually begun.

　　After Xikang was declared peacefully liberated, the Kuomintang bandit gang planned to leave behind bandits and secret agents in Xikang, and under the instigation of the two bandit leaders Hu Zongnan and He Guoguang, they carried out large-scale activities, looting the people, sabotaging transportation, and spreading rumors. After the People's Liberation Army arrived in the area, on the one hand, it resolutely carried out suppression of the stubborn bandits, and on the other hand, it cooperated with the local government to organize rural work teams, convene mass meetings of various strata, strengthen the propaganda of policies, expose the rumors of bandits and secret agents, and combine political offensives to disintegrate the bandits, so that the bandit suppression work was rapidly launched. In the bandit suppression operations and after entering various places, the Liberation Army strictly abided by discipline, cherished the interests of the masses, and helped residents carry dung, sweep the floor, build bridges, and repair roads, which won the enthusiastic support of the people in various places.

　　Guangdong

　　The mainland of Guangdong was completely liberated at the end of November last year. At that time, it was statistically estimated that there were more than 41,000 remaining bandits in the entire region. In the past four months, after the resolute suppression by the People's Liberation Army, as of the end of March, a total of 39,312 people had been wiped out. The Kuomintang bandit gang is still trying to make a last-ditch struggle. Since March, it has sent a large number of secret agents, passing through Hong Kong and Macau, to sneak into the mainland of Guangdong to buy, organize, and incorporate bandits, and establish the so-called "Guangdong Anti-Communist Liberation People's Army Assault Corps." Therefore, the remnant bandits who have been defeated in various places have gradually turned from concealment to publicity, and from scattered to concentrated, carrying out looting and sabotage activities. The Guangdong Military Region Command has once again issued a circular to all its departments to be vigilant, pay close attention to the activities of bandits and secret agents, and requires the close cooperation of the Party, government, army, and people to mobilize the masses and strive to quickly and completely wipe out the remaining bandits on the mainland of Guangdong.

　　Qinghai

　　The Qinghai Provincial People's Government has instructed the people's governments of all cities and counties under its jurisdiction to organize anti-smoking and anti-drug committees, including Party, government, military organs and people's organizations, to be responsible for publicizing and mobilizing the people to earnestly implement the ban. The Provincial People's Government also issued a notice stipulating that all those who have planted opium must be eradicated within a time limit; those who smoke and abuse drugs must register and quit their addiction within a time limit. The Provincial People's Government Health Department has prepared anti-smoking medicines and printed anti-smoking prescriptions, and provides free or reduced-fee treatment for poor addicts.

专栏：各地简讯

　　各地简讯
    四川
    川东军区解放军某部在壁山、铜梁等地进行剿匪时，当地农民积极替部队带路、报告匪情、组织运输队为作战部队运输弹药和粮食。远在六十里外巴县歇马场的三十多个农民闻讯后，亦自动赶来参加运输工作。壁山股匪黄荣卿残部逃入山洞企图负隅顽抗时，当地石匠们立即自动赶来帮助部队凿山，迫使残匪向我投降。很多男女乡民们更亲自拿着猪肉、鸡蛋、茶水，到火线上来慰劳部队。当该地区股匪被我彻底歼灭，匪首被我活捉后，当地居民情绪更为热烈，各村贴满了胜利标语，并烧茶鸣炮欢迎剿匪部队。川西新都踏水乡农民更主动协助部队乡，使隐藏在该乡附近的六十余名匪徒全部落网。随着西南全面剿匪工作的展开，各地人民亦纷纷开始组织地方武装，提出“防匪生产”的口号，积极协助和配合部队剿匪。酆都、巴县、资阳、铜梁各地人民武装都已相继组织起来，他们除积极配合主力进行剿匪战斗外，同时还帮助部队送情报、作向导，监视当地反动分子的破坏行动，揭发特务谣言、保护粮仓、建立日夜巡逻放哨制度，保护当地农民及时进行春耕生产。
            西康
    人民解放军西康军区部队进驻雅安后，即在雅安、芦山、天全等地有重点地进行剿匪，据初步统计，自二月二十一日至三月十九日将近一个月的剿匪作战中共歼匪二千余人。现在残余胡匪已被消灭的地区内，农民已普遍开始春耕，雅安地区的农村群众工作并已逐步展开。
    西康宣告和平解放后，国民党匪帮有计划地留置西康的土匪特务，在胡宗南、贺国光两匪首策动下，大肆活动，抢劫人民，破坏交通，散布谣言。人民解放军到达该地后，一方面对顽匪坚决进行清剿，另一方面配合地方政府组织农村工作队，召开各阶层群众大会，加强宣传政策，揭露土匪特务的造谣，并结合政治攻势，瓦解土匪，使剿匪工作迅速展开。解放军在剿匪作战中和进驻各地后，由于严格遵守纪律，爱护群众利益并帮助居民担粪、扫地、架桥、修路，获得各地人民热烈的拥护和支援。
            广东
    广东大陆于去年十一月底全部解放，当时统计全区残存股匪约四万一千余人，四个月来经人民解放军的坚决进剿，截至三月底止，前后共被歼灭三万九千三百十二名。国民党匪帮最近尚妄图作垂死挣扎，从三月份开始，又派遣大批特务，经过香港、澳门，潜入广东内地，收买、组织、收编土匪，成立所谓“广东反共解放人民军突击总队”，因此各地已被击溃的残余匪徒又逐步由隐蔽转向公开，由分散而集中，进行抢劫和破坏活动。广东军区司令部已再度通令所属各部提高警惕，严密注意土匪特务活动，并要求党、政、军、民密切配合，发动群众，务期迅速全部歼灭广东大陆残匪。
            青海
    青海省人民政府已责成所属各市、县人民政府组织包括党政军机关及人民团体的禁烟禁毒委员会，负责宣传及动员人民认真执行禁令。省人民政府并布告规定：凡已种植鸦片者，限期一律铲除；吸食烟毒者，限期登记并戒除烟瘾。省人民政府卫生处已配制戒烟药及印发戒烟药方，对贫苦瘾民免费或减费予以医治。
