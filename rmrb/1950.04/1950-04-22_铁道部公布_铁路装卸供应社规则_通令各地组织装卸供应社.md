Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in order to unify the management of railway loading and unloading operations nationwide, promulgated and implemented the Regulations for Railway Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperatives on April 15th, and directed all local railways to complete the organization of loading and unloading supply cooperatives before July 1st, regardless of the management system previously adopted for loading and unloading operations. Loading and unloading supply cooperatives are railway peripheral enterprises organized by over 50,000 loading and unloading workers nationwide under the principles of "payment according to labor" and "democratic management," directly under the leadership of railway administration and the Railway General Trade Union, and financially self-sufficient. The Regulations for Railway Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperatives stipulate that loading and unloading workers at each station section should organize supply branches or loading and unloading teams according to the amount of business, and sign collective contracts with the railway authorities, clearly defining responsibilities and rights. The regulations also stipulate that all management personnel of the loading and unloading supply cooperatives should be democratically elected. The loading and unloading operation fee portion of the income shall be distributed to all actual loading and unloading workers according to their labor. The additional 20% loading and unloading management fee is limited to use for improving loading and unloading operations.

It is noted that the feudal exploitation forces still existed in disguise in the national railway loading and unloading operations after liberation because the work system was not thoroughly changed in time (except in the Northeast). According to a survey by the Ministry of Railways in November last year, foremen at the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Rihui Port Station exploited the station's loading and unloading workers for up to 40% of their total income; at Nanjing Jiangbian Station, the number of people who gained without working accounted for one-third of the total number of loading and unloading workers. Due to excessive exploitation, loading and unloading workers had to rely on extorting cargo owners and stealing goods to maintain their lives. In view of this, the Ministry of Railways began trial organization of loading and unloading supply cooperatives at Beijing West Station in July last year and at the North and South Zhengzhou Stations in September, implementing a system of more work, more pay, and payment according to labor. Before the implementation of this system, the loading and unloading fee for general cargo at Zhengzhou Station was about seven jin of white flour per ton, but each loading and unloading worker could only get a part of it. After the implementation of the new system, although the loading and unloading fee was changed to two jin of wheat per ton in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, the income of each loading and unloading worker actually increased by a quarter compared to the past due to the complete elimination of the phenomenon of gaining without working. Before the implementation of the new system at Beijing West Station, the railway bureau paid the same salary every month regardless of how much was loaded and unloaded, according to the regulations of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. This method of equal treatment greatly hindered the enthusiasm of loading and unloading workers. In June last year, it took an average of 5.2 hours to load and unload a freight car at the West Station, exceeding the 4 hours loading and unloading time stipulated by the Ministry of Railways by 1.2 hours, wasting a total of 1,745 hours in a month. After the implementation of the new system, some loading and unloading workers did not fully understand the spirit of the new system in the first month, and their work was still not very active, resulting in a reduction of loading and unloading time to only 4.72 hours in July. However, when paying wages, the average wages were generally higher than in the past, and the loading and unloading workers' production enthusiasm greatly increased, so the loading and unloading time in August was reduced from 4.72 hours to 2.12 hours. In March this year, it was further reduced to one and a half hours. Due to the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency, the turnover rate of railway vehicles was also shortened, and the lives of loading and unloading workers were greatly improved. In the past six months, more than 40 of the 220 loading and unloading workers at Beijing West Station got married, and more than 30 bought bicycles. They all said, "The loading and unloading supply cooperative system allows us to earn more for every ton we load, which was something we never dreamed of when we were exploited by foremen."

### 铁道部公布  铁路装卸供应社规则  通令各地组织装卸供应社

　　铁道部公布
    铁路装卸供应社规则
    通令各地组织装卸供应社
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府铁道部为统一管理全国铁路装卸业务，已于四月十五日公布实行铁路装卸供应社规则，并通令各地铁路无论过去装卸业务采用何种经营制度，一律争取于七月一日前完成装卸供应社组织。装卸供应社系全国五万余装卸工人在“按劳取酬”、“民主管理”的原则下组织起来的，直接受铁路行政及铁路总工会领导，在会计上自给自足的铁路外围企业机构。铁路装卸供应社规则规定：各站段装卸工人按业务量的多少组织供应分社或装卸小组，与铁路方面订立集体合同，明确规定责任与权利。规则并规定装卸供应社的全部管理人员均由民主选出。其收入中装卸作业费部分由全体实际参加装卸工人按劳分配。附加的百分之二十装卸管理费只限办理改进装卸业务之用。
    按全国铁路装卸业务在解放后因未及时彻底改变工作制度（东北除外），封建剥削势力仍然变相存在。据铁道部去年十一月调查：上海局日晖港车站工头剥削该站装卸工人总收入达百分之四十；南京江边站不劳而获的人数占装卸工人总数的三分之一。装卸工人由于受过重剥削，不得不靠勒索货主、偷盗货物以维持生活。铁道部有鉴于此，乃于去年七月开始在北京西站，九月在郑州南北两站试行组织装卸供应社，实行多做多得、按劳取酬制度。在实行这一制度之前，郑州车站的普通货物装卸费每吨约合七斤白面，但装卸工人每人只能得到一部分。实行新制度之后，由于彻底消灭了不劳而获的现象，装卸费虽改为遵照铁道部的规定每吨二斤小麦，但每个装卸工人的收入反而较过去增加四分之一。北京西站在未实行新制度以前，按天津路局的规定不论装卸多少，一律每月由路局垫付一样的工资。这种平均待遇办法大大阻碍了装卸工人的积极性，去年六月份西站平均装卸一车货物需时五·二小时，超过铁道部规定的装卸时间四小时的一·二小时，一个月共浪费一千七百四十五小时。实行新制度后，第一个月因有些装卸工对新制度的精神还不了解，工作仍然不很积极，致七月份的装卸时间只缩短为四·七二小时。但在支付工资时，由于一般平均工资都比过去增加，装卸工人的生产情绪遂大增，八月份的装卸时间就由四·七二小时缩短为二·一二小时。今年三月间更进一步缩短到一小时半。由于装卸效率的提高，铁路车辆周转率也随之缩短，装卸工人的生活也因此得到大大的提高。半年来北京西站二百二十个装卸工人中，有四十多人结了婚，有三十多人买了自行车。他们都说：“装卸供应社制度使我们多做一吨就多得一吨的钱，这是过去受工头剥削时候梦想不到的事。”
