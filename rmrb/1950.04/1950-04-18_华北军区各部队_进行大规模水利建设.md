Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Troops of a certain army corps of the North China Military Region and directly subordinate divisions of the military region, as well as troops from the Chahar, Hebei, and Pingyuan provincial military regions, have devoted a large amount of manpower to water conservancy construction. This large-scale water conservancy production movement began in full swing at the beginning of this month.

The troops have contracted 3,385,000 workdays from the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau and the water conservancy bureaus of various provinces in North China. This includes flood control and levee restoration, river dredging and drainage projects on the Yongding River, Hai River, Luan River, North Grand Canal, Ziya River, and Sanggan River, as well as some canal irrigation projects in Chahar, Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan provinces.

Commanders and fighters have enthusiastically undertaken these enormous water conservancy construction projects. The military region's river dredging plan stipulates that one worker should excavate three cubic meters of earth per day, but since the start of work, all units have exceeded this standard, generally averaging about 3.7 to 3.8 cubic meters of earth. During labor, no one complained of hardship or fatigue, and everyone competed to do the heaviest work. Zhang Dabing and Zhang Qingyu, soldiers from the seventh company of a certain regiment who won the first meritorious service in scaling the city walls during the Taiyuan campaign, continuously carried earth for six days without asking for a replacement; the political commissar and chief of staff of a certain regiment also dug earth and carried mud with the soldiers every day. These deeds greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the troops. Liu Gaozhong, a platoon leader of the first company of the regiment, carried as many as 426 loads of earth in one day.

The commanders and fighters' vigorous production enthusiasm was greatly praised by the masses. An old fellow from the Qianzipu Village production team, who was working alongside the troops, said, "These young men are really capable. They are tough in battle, and even better than us in production (a Northern way of saying good)."

　　华北军区各部队
    进行大规模水利建设
    【新华社十五日讯】人民解放军华北军区某兵团及军区各直属师，察哈尔、河北、平原等省军区部队，以大量人力投入水利建设。这一大规模水利生产运动，已于本月初旬全面展开。
    各部队向华北水利工程局和华北各省水利局包工三百三十八万五千个：包括永定河、海河、滦河、北运河、子牙河、桑干河的防洪复堤、挖河排水工程和察哈尔、山西、河北、平原等省的一部分开渠灌溉工程。
    指战员们以欢欣鼓舞的心情，负担起这些巨大的水利建设工程。军区挖河计划中规定一个工每天挖三立方土，但开工以来，各部队都超过了这一标准，一般平均约三点七、八立方土。指战员们在劳动中没有人叫苦叫累，而且都抢着干最重的活。解放太原战役荣获登城首功的某团七连战士张大兵、张庆余一直挑了六天土不叫人换；某团团政治委员和参谋长，每天也和战士们一起挖土挑泥。这些事迹都大大地鼓舞了部队的劳动热情。该团第一连排长刘高忠一天挑土达四百二十六担。
    指战员们旺盛的生产热忱，大为群众所称赞。和部队一起生产的千字铺村生产队的一位老乡说：“小伙子们真行，打仗挺硬，生产比我们还棒（北方话说好的意思）。”
