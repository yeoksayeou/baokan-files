A New Stage in the Movement to Defend World Peace
Returning from Stockholm (Part 1) (Above)
Xiao San

A full year has passed since the World Congress of Partisans of Peace was held in Paris and Prague (April 20-25) last year. Over the past year, the world movement to defend peace has made great achievements. The number of people supporting peace is constantly increasing all over the world. If last year, when the first World Congress of Partisans of Peace was held, there were 600 million organized people who supported peace, now there are 1 billion.

The founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the German Democratic Republic have greatly strengthened the power of the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union.

The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is of great significance for guaranteeing peace in the Far East and the world.

The Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace, chaired by the world-renowned scientist Professor Joliot-Curie, leads the worldwide movement to defend peace.

National committees for the defense of peace have been organized in more than fifty countries. In addition, the Standing Committee has established contact with democratic organizations in twenty-nine countries. So far, about thirty countries have held national peace congresses. These organizations and conferences fully demonstrate the determination of people from all over the world to oppose imperialist wars of aggression and to defend world peace. In Italy, in the countries of Central Europe, in France, in the Soviet Union, China, Japan, India, Australia, Africa, the Near East, in South America in Cuba, Argentina, etc., in North America in Canada... the movement to support peace is extremely active.

A movement against atomic weapons has been launched in forty countries.

All of these prove that the strength of the peace camp is growing, and the movement to defend peace is constantly rising all over the world.

But on the other hand, the warmongers have become even more frantic. The warmongers, led by U.S. imperialism, are actively organizing, propagating, provoking, and preparing for a new Third World War in various parts of the world to oppose the Soviet Union and the democratic countries.

Some military alliances of imperialist aggressor groups have now begun to take effect.

The meeting of military leaders of the countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, which ended on April 2 in The Hague, is sufficient to prove the active preparations for war. According to the instructions of American General Bradley, this meeting formulated specific plans for the economic and military mobilization of these countries, national budgets were changed accordingly, and plans for the transportation of weapons were set.

American generals at the meeting demanded that Western European countries expand their armies, strengthen their air forces, and increase war preparations funds. They also demanded that Western European countries militarize many industrial sectors - converting them to the production of munitions. As the Dutch newspaper "De Waarheid" said, the American generals want to turn the Netherlands into a military camp, where there can be no freedom and no democracy. They fantasize about turning the whole of Western Europe into a large military barracks, just like Hitler did...

In addition to this, imperialist aggressor warmongers are also organizing other war alliances and building war bases. For example, Churchill openly advocated in the British House of Commons that West Germany should participate in the Anglo-American aggression plan.

The German Communist Party believes that the so-called "Franco-German Alliance" related to the above plan is to link the Ruhr region, this military-industrial area, with France in order to realize the American aggressive attempt against the Soviet Union, the democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic.

The imperialist countries are frantically engaged in an arms race. In the national budgets of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, and France, military spending always greatly exceeds health and education spending. Taking the United States as an example, its military spending accounts for 75 percent of the total budget, while health and national education spending together account for less than 2 percent. (In the Soviet Union in 1949, defense spending accounted for only 19 percent of the total national budget, while spending on culture, education, and social health care accounted for 26 percent).

Imperialist preparations for wars of aggression are now intensifying. Seeing the power of the peace movement expanding and strengthening day by day, war provocateurs, like dogs jumping over a wall in desperation, desperately engage in atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and prepare for germ warfare. These heartless and soulless war provocateurs feel happy only when they kill millions of peace-loving people for the benefit of their small handful of people.

But the people of all countries in the world are not like they used to be. They are becoming more and more aware and organized. In order to save their own lives and to save their descendants, they are strongly opposed to suffering another massacre, and they are actively fighting for peace.

Leading this broad struggle is the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace. This Standing Committee held its first meeting in Paris last April. It held its second meeting in Rome last October. Last December, the Standing Committee issued a call to the people and parliaments and governments of all countries, calling for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Beginning in February this year, it sent many delegations to visit various countries and present appeals to the parliaments of various countries. The parliaments of Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria discussed and passed resolutions supporting the suggestions of the Standing Committee. When the delegation arrived in the Soviet Union, it was warmly received by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

But the Dutch Minister of Justice rudely expelled the delegation from the country. The US government completely refused the delegation entry! British Prime Minister Attlee and Conservative Party leader Churchill rudely refused to meet with the delegation. - The heads of government of these countries have completely revealed their true colors; they do not want peace, they want war.

This call from the Standing Committee forced the war provocateurs to reveal their true colors. Because the US and British imperialists themselves revealed their ferocious faces, the struggle of the people of the world against war and for the defense of peace has become even stronger. It was in this international situation that the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace convened its third meeting in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden.

China was unable to send representatives to attend the first and second meetings of the Standing Committee. This time, for the third meeting of the Standing Committee, brothers were sent to participate. Now, a brief report on the simple process and important decisions of this meeting will be made to our readers.

　　保卫世界和平运动的新阶段
    从斯德哥尔摩归来（之一）（上）
    萧三
    自从去年四月（二十——二十五）在巴黎和布拉格尔地举行了全世界拥护和平大会以来，到现在已经整一年了。这一年以来，世界拥护和平的运动，已经有了很大的成绩。全世界各个地方赞成和平的人数正在不断地增加。假如去年开第一次世界拥护和平大会的时候，赞成和平的有组织的群众是六万万人，那么现在有十万万人了。
    中华人民共和国的成立，德意志民主共和国的建立，大大加强了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立，对保障远东以及世界的和平事业，更有非常大的意义。
    以世界著名的科学家居里教授为主席的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，领导着全世界的保卫和平运动。
    在五十多个国家里组织了全国性的保卫和平委员会。此外，常设委员会还和二十九个国家的民主组织发生联系。截至现在为止，已经有约三十个国家举行了全国保卫和平大会。这些组织和大会充分表现世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略战争、拥护世界和平的决心。在意大利，在中欧各国，在法国、在苏联、中国、日本、印度、澳洲、非洲、近东各国，在南美洲的古巴、阿根廷等国，在北美洲的坎拿大………拥护和平运动开展得极为活跃。
    在四十个国家里掀起了反对原子武器的运动。
    这些都证明和平阵营的力量是增长了，保卫和平的运动在全世界是不断地高涨的。
    但是另一方面，战争贩子们也更加疯狂了。以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子在地球上各个地方积极组织、宣传、挑拨、准备新的第三次世界大战，以反对苏联和各民主国家。
    帝国主义者侵略集团的某些军事同盟现在已开始发生效力了。
    今年四月二日完结的，在海牙开的参加北大西洋公约各国的军事领袖会议，就足以证明备战的积极。照美国将军布勒德里的指示，这次会上制出这些国家的经济军事化的具体计划，国家预算跟着有所改变，定出运输武器的计划。
    美国的将军们在会上要求西欧各国扩充陆军，加强空军，增加备战款项。他们并且要求西欧各国把许多工业部门军事化——改为生产军火。这正如荷兰报纸“德·瓦阿尔海德”所说，美国将军们想把荷兰变为军营，在那里不能有自由，不能有民主。他们幻想变整个西欧为一个大兵营，照希特勒的办法……
    除此以外，帝国主义侵略战争的贩子们还正在组织其他战争同盟，建立战事基地。例如，邱吉尔在英国会下院公开主张把西德参加英美侵略计划。
    德国共产党认为和上述计划有关的所谓“法德同盟”，就是把鲁尔区域这个军工地域和法国联结起来，以实现美国的侵略企图，反对苏联，各民主国家和德意志民主共和国。
    各帝国主义国家疯狂地进行军备竞赛。美国、英国、荷兰、意大利、法国的国家预算里，军事的费用总是大大地超过保健和教育的费用的。拿美国为例，它的军费占全部预算百分之七十五，而保健和国民教育费，一共不到百分之二。（苏联一九四九年的国防费只占全部国家预算的百分之十九，而文化教育及社会保健费占百分之二十六）。
    帝国主义的侵略战争准备，现在更其加紧起来了。看到和平运动的力量一天天扩大、加强，战争挑拨者就好像狗急跳墙似的，拼命搞原子弹、氢气弹，并且准备细菌战。这批狼心狗肺的战争挑拨者为了自己少数一撮人的利益，硬要杀死成百万的爱好和平的老百姓，心里才痛快。
    但是现在世界各国的老百姓可不像从前了。他们一天天觉悟起来，组织起来了。为了要救自己的性命，要救自己的后代，他们极力反对再一次遭受屠杀，他们积极为了和平而斗争起来了。
    领导这个广泛的斗争的是世界拥护和平大会常设委员会。这个常委会去年四月在巴黎开了第一次会议。去年十月在罗马开了第二次会议。去年十二月常委向各国人民和各国议会、政府发出号召，要求缩减军备，禁止原子武器。今年二月起又派了许多代表团去各国访问，向各国议会呈递呼吁书。罗马尼亚、匈牙利、波兰、捷克、保加利亚各国的国会都讨论了，通过了议案，支持和大常委的建议。代表团到了苏联，受到苏联最高苏维埃热诚的接待。
    但是荷兰的司法部长粗暴无礼地驱逐代表团出境。美国政府完全拒绝代表团入境！英国的首相艾德礼和保守党领袖邱吉尔无礼地拒绝接见代表团。——这些国家的政府首脑完全露出了他们的本来面目来了；他们不愿意和平，他们要的是战争。
    和大常委的这个号召，逼得战争挑拨者露出他们的本相来。由于美英帝国主义者自己揭开了凶恶的面孔，就使得世界人民反对战争、保卫和平的斗争更加强起来。就在这样的国际形势当中，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会在瑞典的首都斯德哥尔摩召开了第三次会议。
    常设委员会第一、二次会议中国都没有能够派代表去出席。这次第三次常委会就派了兄弟去参加了。现在把这次会议的简单经过和重要决定向我们的读者作一个简单报告。
