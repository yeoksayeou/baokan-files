Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The Worker's Daily here published an editorial entitled "Two Major Documents Concerning Labor Policy," the full text of which is as follows:

　　On the eve of this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated two important documents concerning labor policy: one is the draft Trade Union Law submitted by the State Council to the Central People's Government Committee for approval, and the other is the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises" issued by the Ministry of Labor with the approval of the State Council. The former document defines the legal status and responsibilities of the working class's mass organization—the trade union—under the New Democratic regime, and the latter document demonstrates the new labor-capital relationship under the New Democratic regime. These are both the fruits of victory won by the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao after nearly thirty years of revolutionary struggle, and are worthy of special welcome and celebration by all workers and the entire people.
  (I)
　　As early as after the First National Labor Congress in 1922, the Chinese working class, under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Secretariat of the Chinese Labor Unions, launched a vigorous labor legislation movement, demanding that the then so-called parliament recognize the right of workers to assembly and association. The nineteen "Outlines of Labor Legislation" proposed at that time, in addition to being raised as a program for the upsurge of strikes by the working class, had no direct results. The "February 7th" Beijing-Hankou Railway Workers' Strike in 1923 was precisely to fight for the freedom to organize trade unions, and as a result, it suffered the cruel massacre by Wu Peifu, the running dog of imperialism and the feudal warlord at that time. Since then, for the past twenty-eight years, the Chinese working class, always under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has waged continuous struggles against the reactionary regimes of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for the freedom to organize trade unions and political freedom rights, suffering continuous suppression, devastation, and massacres, and many advanced working-class leaders and outstanding elements have sacrificed their lives. Historical facts prove that under the rule of the reactionary regimes in the past, the working class had no freedom to organize its own trade unions at all, and there was no question of political rights at all. Only today, after overthrowing the reactionary rule and establishing the people's regime led by the working class, have the worker masses obtained the true freedom to organize trade unions and all other political freedom rights, and only then can such a progressive draft Trade Union Law protecting the interests of the working class be proposed.

　　This draft Trade Union Law first defines the trade union as a mass organization voluntarily formed by the working class, and all employed laborers have the right to organize trade unions; it defines the basic principle of trade union organization as democratic centralism, with its own independent and unified organizational system throughout the country. These are all regulations made based on the Charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions adopted by the Sixth National Labor Congress, that is, based on the will of the entire worker masses. This means that the People's Government consolidates the will and demands of the broad masses with state laws.

　　The vast majority of the provisions of this draft Trade Union Law stipulate the rights conferred by the state to trade union organizations. Among them, it is particularly important to stipulate that trade union organizations in state-owned, public-owned, and joint state-private enterprises "have the right to represent the masses of employed workers and staff in participating in production management and concluding collective contracts with the administration," and that trade union organizations in private enterprises "have the right to represent the masses of employed workers and staff in conducting negotiations and bargaining with the capitalists, participating in labor-capital consultation meetings, and concluding collective contracts with the capitalists." The grass-roots trade union committee has the right to protest when the enterprise administration or the capitalist employs and dismisses workers in violation of the laws and decrees of the People's Government or the collective contract. The draft Trade Union Law also clearly stipulates that governments at all levels and enterprise administrations or capitalists should provide trade union organizations with material assistance, such as: the administration or capitalists of factories, mines, shops, institutions, farms, or schools should allocate 2% of the total actual wages of all employed workers and staff on a monthly basis to the grass-roots trade union committee as trade union operating expenses, and governments at all levels and enterprise administrations or capitalists should allocate necessary real estate and equipment to trade union organizations. The People's Government guarantees these rights of trade union organizations with laws and decrees, which provides trade union organizations with more favorable conditions for development. These are all proofs of the People's Government's guarantee of the interests of the working class.

　　It can be seen from this that such a Trade Union Law can only be promulgated by a regime led by the working class itself. That is to say, only under the people's regime can the worker masses obtain such political rights. Therefore, the establishment of the People's Government is the most basic fruit of victory won by our working class after nearly thirty years of struggle. Cherishing this fruit and consolidating this regime are the basic preconditions for our working class to strive for greater victories and a happy life in the future. Therefore, every trade union organization has the responsibility to "educate and organize the worker and staff masses, safeguard the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and promote the policies of the People's Government to consolidate the people's regime led by the working class"; every worker and staff member must consolidate their own regime with their own practical actions and become a model for safeguarding and promoting the policies and decrees of the People's Government in order to consolidate our acquired fruits of victory. At the same time, the work of trade unions under our own regime must at all times take doing a good job in production and developing production as its top priority. Because only by doing a good job in production and developing production can the lives of the working class be gradually improved. This is the highest interest of the working class today. Therefore, in order to ensure the completion of the state's production plan, every trade union organization must "educate and organize the worker and staff masses, establish a new attitude towards labor, abide by labor discipline, and organize production competitions and other production movements." At the same time, "in public enterprises, protect state property, oppose corruption and waste, and fight against sabotage elements," and "in private enterprises, promote the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and oppose acts that violate government policies and decrees and hinder production." Only in this way can we protect the fundamental interests of the working class, achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy, make China gradually become a prosperous and happy country with industrial development, and prepare for the conditions for transitioning to socialism in the future.

　　Finally, the promulgation of this draft Trade Union Law will undoubtedly be of great help to the development of trade union work throughout the country. Of course, having this decree does not mean that trade union work is done well. Therefore, while enthusiastically supporting the promulgation of this draft Trade Union Law, we must pay more attention to closely connecting with the masses, organizing the masses, and earnestly and responsibly doing trade union work well in accordance with the provisions of the draft Trade Union Law. Only in this way can the draft Trade Union Law become a practical weapon for our trade union organizations, trade union cadres, and the working-class masses.
  (II)

　　The labor-capital consultation meeting is an organizational form and method for realizing Chairman Mao's "both labor and capital benefit" policy. This organizational form and method was created by workers and factory owners in private factories and enterprises in Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places in actual work. Its basic spirit is to solve all issues related to the interests of both labor and capital in the factory by using the method of equal consultation based on democratic principles. In this way, on the one hand, it changes the previous oppressed status of workers who had no rights in production and can promote workers' enthusiasm and creativity for production while protecting their due rights and interests; on the other hand, it enables the capitalist to find a new way to exercise their management and management rights and can better manage their own enterprises. Now, many progressive industrialists and businessmen have clearly recognized the following truth: the old management methods of relying on oppression and coercion to rule workers are no longer feasible, and new methods of democratic and equal consultation must be used to better manage the factory; the method of only seeking the interests of the capitalist and not taking care of the interests of the workers in the past is also not feasible, and now, in order to do a good job in production, the interests of the workers must be taken care of at all times. The labor-capital consultation meeting is the best organizational form for realizing these methods. Facts have proved that all factories, enterprises, or industries that have established labor-capital consultation meetings can make production better and realize benefits for both labor and capital (such as the Beiyang and Hengyuan yarn factories in Tianjin), or when factories and enterprises experience difficulties, can enable both labor and capital to understand each other and achieve the goal of working together to overcome difficulties and overcome the difficulties (such as some industries in Shanghai recently). It is precisely in order to promote the normalization of labor-capital relations and to achieve the goal of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital that the People's Government has turned this good creation of the masses into state laws to make it universally implemented.

　　The labor-capital relationship under the New Democratic regime should be a democratic, equal, mutually beneficial, and contractual relationship, using collective contracts and labor contracts to stipulate the rights and obligations of both labor and capital and all labor conditions, using the methods of negotiation, bargaining, and mediation and arbitration by the labor bureau to resolve labor disputes, and now, the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings has been added to solve all issues related to the interests of both labor and capital in factories and enterprises. In this way, we have a set of methods to realize Chairman Mao's basic policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, which is not only beneficial to both labor and capital but also beneficial to the economic development of the entire country and should be resolutely implemented by both labor and capital.

　　These two important documents concerning labor policy were formulated in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and in accordance with Chairman Mao's established policies and guidelines, and both specifically demonstrate the new class relations under the New Democratic regime: the working class is the leading class of the people's regime, has the status of master in public enterprises, and also has the status of equal consultation with capitalists in private enterprises and is not oppressed. We want to repeat a sentence, this is the great fruit of victory won by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, uniting the entire people and working hard for thirty years. We must defend this fruit of victory, support these two important documents that clarify the labor policy of the People's Government, and support the People's Government and our great and wise leader Chairman Mao.

### 有关劳动政策的两大文件——工人日报社论

　　有关劳动政策的两大文件
    ——工人日报社论
    【新华社二十九日讯】此间工人日报以“有关劳动政策的两大文件”为题发表社论，全文如下：
    正当今年“五一”国际劳动节的前夜，中央人民政府政务院公布了有关劳动政策的两个重要文件：一个是政务院提请中央人民政府委员会通过的工会法草案，另一个是经政务院批准由劳动部发布的关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示。前一个文件确定了工人阶级群众组织——工会在新民主主义政权下的法律地位和职责，后一个文件表明了在新民主主义政权下的新的劳资关系，这都是中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，进行了近三十年的革命斗争所获得的胜利果实，是值得全体工人群众和全体人民特别欢迎和庆祝的。
  （一）
    远在一九二二年第一次全国劳动大会之后，中国工人阶级就在中国共产党、中国劳动组合书记部的直接领导之下，展开了轰轰烈烈的劳动立法运动，要求当时所谓国会承认劳动者有集会结社权。当时提出的十九条“劳动立法大纲”，除掉被提成为当时工人阶级罢工高潮中斗争的纲领而外，毫无直接的结果。一九二三年“二七”京汉铁路工人大罢工，也就是为了争取组织工会的自由，结果遭受到当时帝国主义的走狗封建军阀吴佩孚的残酷屠杀。自此以后，廿八年以来，中国工人阶级，始终在中国共产党的领导之下，为着争取组织工会的自由和政治自由权利，向帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动政权，进行不断的斗争，遭受着不断的镇压、摧残和屠杀，有许多先进的工人阶级领袖和优秀分子牺牲了自己的生命。历史事实证明：在过去反动政权的统治之下，工人阶级是根本没有组织自己工会的自由的，根本谈不到政治权利的。只有今天，推翻了反动统治，建立了由工人阶级领导的人民政权后，工人群众才获得了真正组织工会的自由和其他一切政治自由权利，才能有这样进步的保护工人阶级利益的工会法草案的提出。
    这个工会法草案首先确定了工会为工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织，凡属一切雇佣劳动者都有组织工会的权利；确定了工会组织的基本原则为民主集中制，在全国范围内有自己的独立的统一的组织系统。这都是根据第六次全国劳动大会所通过的中华全国总工会的章程，亦即根据全体工人群众的意志所作的规定。这就是说，人民政府用国家法令把广大群众的意志和要求巩固起来了。
    这个工会法草案的绝大部分规定国家赋予工会组织的权利。其中特别重要的是规定国营、公营、公私合营企业中的工会组织，“有代表受雇之工人、职员群众参加生产管理及与行政缔结集体合同之权”，在私营企业中的工会组织，“有代表受雇工人、职员群众与资方进行交涉、谈判，参加劳资协商会议并与资方缔结集体合同之权”，企业行政或资方雇用与解雇工人有违反人民政府法令或集体合同情事时，工会基层委员会有抗议权等。工会法草案同时明确规定了各级政府和企业行政或资方应给工会组织以物质上的帮助，如：工厂、矿场、商店、机关、农场或学校的行政或资方，应按所雇全部职工实际工资总额的百分之二，按月拨交工会基层委员会作为工会工作费，以及各级政府和企业行政或资方应拨给工会组织以必要的房产与设备等。人民政府用法令保障了工会组织这些权利，就使工会组织有了更顺利发展的条件。这些都是人民政府保障工人阶级利益的证明。
    由此可见，这样的工会法是只有工人阶级自己领导的政权才能发布的，也就是说，只有在人民政权之下，工人群众才能获得这样的政治权利。所以人民政府的建立，是我们工人阶级经过将近三十年的斗争所获得的最基本的胜利果实。爱护这个果实，巩固这个政权，也就是我们工人阶级争取今后更大的胜利和幸福生活的基本前提。所以每个工会组织都有责任“教育并组织工人、职员群众，维护人民政府法令，推行人民政府政策，以巩固工人阶级领导的人民政权”；每个工人和职员都必须以自己的实际行动来巩固自己的政权，成为维护与推行人民政府政策法令的模范，才能巩固我们既得的胜利果实。同时，在我们自己政权下的工会工作，任何时期都必须是以搞好生产，发展生产为自己头等重要的任务。因为只有搞好生产，发展生产，才能使工人阶级的生活逐渐改善起来，这就是今天工人阶级的最高利益。因此，每个工会组织为了保证国家生产计划的完成，都必须“教育并组织工人、职员群众，树立新的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律，组织生产竞赛及其他生产运动”。同时“在公营企业中，保护国家财产，反对贪污浪费，并与破坏分子作斗争”，“在私营企业中，推行劳资两利政策，反对违背政府政策法令及妨害生产之行为”。只有如此，才能保护工人阶级的根本利益，达到发展生产、繁荣经济的目的，使中国逐渐成为工业发展的富强幸福的国家，并准备将来过渡到社会主义的条件。
    最后，这个工会法草案的公布，对于全国工会工作的开展，无疑是一个极大的帮助。当然，有了这个法令绝不等于就做好了工会工作。所以我们在热烈拥护这个工会法草案的公布时，更要注意密切联系群众，组织群众，认真负责地根据工会法草案的规定，把工会工作做好。只有这样，工会法草案对于我们的工会组织，工会干部和工人阶级群众，才能成为实际的武器。
  （二）
    劳资协商会议是实现毛主席所指示的“劳资两利”政策的一种组织形式和方法。这个组织形式和方法是天津、武汉等地私营工厂企业中的工人和厂主在实际工作中创造出来的。它的基本精神，就是根据民主原则用平等协商的方法来解决工厂中有关劳资双方利益的一切问题。这样，一方面改变了以前工人在生产中毫无权利的被压迫地位，而能发扬工人对生产的积极性和创造精神，同时保护自己的应有的权益；另一方面使资方找到了行使自己的经营权和管理权的新方式，而能更好地经营自己的企业。现在已有不少的进步工商业者明确认识下面这个真理：依靠压迫强制来统治工人的旧的管理方式，已经行不通了，必须用民主平等协商的新方式，才能更好的管理工厂，过去专求资方一利，毫不照顾工人利益的办法也行不通了，现在为要搞好生产必须随时照顾工人的利益。劳资协商会议便是实现这些办法的最好的组织形式。事实证明，凡属建立了劳资协商会议的工厂企业或行业，都能使生产搞好起来，实现劳资两利（如天津的北洋、恒源纱厂），或者在工厂企业感受困难的时候，能使劳资双方互相谅解，达到共同努力克服困难，渡过难关的目的（如最近上海某些行业）。人民政府正是为了促进劳资关系的正常化，为了达到发展生产、劳资两利的目的，所以把群众中这种好的创造，变为国家法令来使其普遍推行。
    在新民主主义政权下的劳资关系应当是民主的、平等的、两利的、契约的关系，用集体合同和劳动合同来规定劳资双方的权利义务和一切劳动条件，用交涉、谈判和劳动局的调解仲裁方法来解决劳资争议，现在又加上了建立劳资协商会议来解决工厂企业中有关劳资双方利益的一切问题。这样，我们就有了一套办法来实现毛主席指示的发展生产、劳资两利的基本方针，这不仅是于劳资双方有利，而且是于整个国家经济发展有利的事情，是劳资双方都应当坚决执行的。
    这两个有关劳动政策的重要文件，都是根据人民政协所通过的共同纲领的精神，根据毛主席的既定政策方针所制定出来的，都具体表现了新民主主义政权下的新的阶级关系：工人阶级是人民政权的领导阶级，在公营企业中是主人翁的地位，在私营企业中也有了与资方平等协商的地位，而不受压迫了。我们要重复一句，这就是工人阶级在共产党和毛主席领导下团结全体人民，艰苦奋斗三十年所获得的伟大的胜利果实。我们要保卫这个胜利的果实，拥护这两个阐明人民政府劳动政策的重要文件，拥护人民政府和我们伟大的英明的领袖毛主席。
