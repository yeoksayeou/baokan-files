　　Seventeenth District Develops Vegetable Garden Production
　　Garden Owners and Workers Sign Contracts
　　[Report from this newspaper] In the villages outside Deshengmen, first, second, and fourth streets of the Seventeenth District of Beijing, as well as Beitaiping Xin Village and Mengjiafen Village, over ten vegetable garden operators have signed labor contracts with their employees. Both parties are now focusing on developing production with peace of mind. After the liberation of Beijing, some vegetable garden operators, not understanding the land reform policy, fearing "land redistribution," and fearing that workers would demand higher wages, used excuses to dismiss workers or switch to planting dry crops. Workers, fearing dismissal, felt very insecure in their work. After land reform, vegetable garden operators were still afraid of being accused of "exploitation" and dared not boldly hire workers for production; employment became a problem for the workers. After government personnel conducted policy education on developing production and mutual benefit for labor and capital for both parties, both parties expressed a desire to sign contracts. Government personnel first helped local horticultural workers establish a trade union, and then found one or two vegetable garden owners to have the union representatives, district work group personnel, and workers who originally worked for that household negotiate with the employer to draft a collective labor contract. The draft contract was then discussed and approved in the trade union, and each worker then discussed with their original employer according to this standard, formally signed a labor contract, and submitted it to the district government for approval and implementation. In the contracts signed this time, wages have been appropriately adjusted. For example, the annual wage (previous autumn) has increased from the original eleven *shi* of corn to twelve *shi*. Worker welfare has also been improved compared to before. For example, Labor Day will be a one-day holiday, and in summer, operators will give each employee a straw hat; workers who take sick leave within one month will still be paid; and if workers are injured on the job, the medical expenses will be borne by the employer. The contract also clearly stipulates that the operator has the right to direct production and must not dismiss workers or interfere with workers' participation in political activities without reason.

　　十七区发展菜园生产
    园主园工签订合同
    【本报讯】京郊十七区德胜门外一、二、四街及北太平薪村、蒙家坟村等村，已有十余户菜园经营主与雇工签订了劳资合同。双方均安心致力发展生产。北京解放后，某些菜园经营主因不了解土地改革政策，怕“分地”，怕工人多要工资，就借故遣散工人，或改种旱地。工人因怕解雇，生产情绪极不安定。土地改革后，菜园经营主还怕别人说“剥削”，不敢大胆雇工生产；雇工就业成了问题。政府人员在向主雇双方进行了发展生产、劳资两利的政策教育后，双方都有了签订合同的要求。政府人员首先帮助当地园艺工人成立了工会，随在菜园主中找出一两户，由工会代表、区工作组人员及原在该户作工的工人三方与雇主进行协商，订立集体劳资合同草案。然后在工会中讨论通过合同草案，各工人即按此标准与原雇主商谈，正式签订劳资合同，由区政府批准执行。这次签订的合同中，工资已有适当调整。如领人工资（前秋）由原十一石玉米增至十二石。工人福利事项也较前有所改进。如五一节放假一天，夏季由经营主发给每个雇工一顶草帽；工人因病请假在一个月以内者工资照发；工人因工负伤者，医药费由资方负担。合同并明确规定了经营主在生产上有指挥权利，不得无故解雇工人和干涉工人参加政治活动等。（十七区区政府秘书室）
