　　Hungary's Five-Year Plan
    Translated by Li Zelan
    The Construction Period Completed After the Three-Year Plan

    The Three-Year Plan will be completed seven months ahead of schedule in 1949, meaning it will be completed in two years and five months, and a new economic plan must be drafted.

    This Three-Year Plan is a plan to construct and revive Hungary's economy, which was devastated by the war.

    This construction and revival plan has increased Hungary's wealth. New workshops have been added to the Ganz Electrical Factory, the Ganz Wagon Factory, and the Ganz Shipyard. A nitrate plant was established in Bert, an electric power station was established in Mata, and a new state-owned textile factory was established. Roads have been opened everywhere, and the work of electrifying villages has begun...

    According to preliminary statistics, the output of factories, mines, and hardware foundries under the Three-Year Plan is 18.7 billion forints (the standard monetary unit of Hungary, equivalent to about 8.5 US cents). According to current results, there is no doubt that this figure will become 19 billion by the end of 1949. Therefore, factories, mines, and hardware foundries under the Three-Year Plan will be 100% completed seven months ahead of schedule. Some industrial sectors, especially heavy industry and machinery, have indeed exceeded the goals of the Three-Year Plan. However, other sectors, mainly light industry, have experienced slight delays in production. In agriculture, assuming that the harvest in 1949 is still barely satisfactory, then we can reach the goals stipulated in the Three-Year Plan. The standard of living has also exceeded the expected level.

    Regardless of the sabotage of the imperialists, we have achieved great success. The Hungarian working class, peasants, intellectuals, and small business owners understand the importance of this plan and spare no effort to complete it.

    Three years ago, factories, mines, and hardware foundries were almost entirely owned by capitalists, but now 87% are in the hands of the people's government.

    Three years ago, banks were almost entirely controlled by capitalists, but now they are in the hands of the state.

    Three years ago, foreign trade was almost entirely monopolized by capitalists, but now it is 100% operated by the state.

    Three years ago, wholesale trade was almost entirely controlled by capitalists, but now the state controls 75% of it.

    Three years ago, the state and cooperative shares in retail trade accounted for only 3%, but now they account for 20%.

    Three years ago, millions of peasants struggled and cultivated the land under the greatest economic difficulties, while also worrying about the land being taken back by the landlords or falling into the usurious nets of the rich peasants. However, our people's democratic government protected our peasants, and the machine stations gave them great help. By the end of 1949, there will be 200 machine stations and 3,500 tractors nationwide. Small-scale production still occupies an important position in agriculture, but the production cooperative movement has been well established.

    In three years, our country has indeed developed into a country of workers and peasants. In our country, power is in the hands of the working class allied with the peasants.

    After the completion of the Three-Year Plan, the construction and revival period will come to an end. A new period will begin, namely the period of economic transformation and development. The Three-Year Plan has prepared all the conditions to allow us to complete the various tasks that have already begun, laying a socialist foundation not only in industry but also in agriculture and trade. Therefore, we need a Five-Year Plan.

            A Plan for Transforming and Further Developing the National Economy

    The main tasks of the Five-Year Plan are:

    (1) Accelerate the industrialization of Hungary, especially the development of heavy industry and engineering, as this is a decisive condition for developing light industry, agricultural mechanization, and modernizing transportation.

    (2) Eliminate the backwardness of our agriculture and significantly increase its production to provide enough food for our growing population, ensure the growth of industry, and meet the import needs of the national economy.

    (3) Raise the living standards of our people, which is guaranteed by industrialization and the reorganization of agriculture.

    (4) End the educational monopoly of the past ruling class and create the necessary conditions for the development of the culture of the working class and its alliance—the peasants—training new leaders from worker and peasant backgrounds (engineers, doctors, teachers, organizers and managers of the economy and industry, officers, civil servants, etc.) to direct administrative, economic, and cultural construction.

    (5) Create decisive conditions to gradually eliminate the differences between cities and villages.

    (6) Develop our national defense and guard forces to defend our independence, and defend peace against warmongers with the Soviet Union, friendly people's democratic regimes, and freedom-loving people around the world.

    The result of the Five-Year Plan will be that socialist production will occupy a superior position in the national economy.

    In order to accomplish these goals, within five years, we will invest 35 billion forints, of which 17 billion will be invested in industry, 6 billion in agriculture (this should include industry, transportation, health, cultural organizations, construction, etc., that are directly beneficial to agriculture; the total investment in rural areas is about 6 billion forints), 6 billion in transportation, 3.5 billion in social and cultural undertakings, and 2.5 billion will be invested in housing construction.

    Of the total investment of 35 billion, about 14 billion will be allocated to building houses.

    The successful implementation of this plan can be guaranteed by our annually increasing national income and the fact that the national income in 1954 will be 160% of that in 1949. Also, the roughly 40% increase in industrial production within five years can guarantee the practical implementation of this plan.

    The value of industrial products (including minerals and metallurgy), if compared with 1949, will increase by 80% in 1954, thus increasing industrial production to 230% of that in 1938.

    The value of agricultural products in 1954 will be 35% higher than in 1949, thus increasing agricultural production to 127% of that in 1938.

    The annual production of factories, mines, and hardware foundries can be increased from 18 billion forints to 34 billion within five years.

            Achieving Socialism Through Industrialization

    The proportion of industry producing machines that can be used for reproduction can be increased from 48% of annual production to 53% within five years, thus making heavy industry and engineering dominant in industry.

    Steel production can be increased from 1.1 million tons to 1.8 million tons.

    Electricity production can be increased from 2.2 billion kilowatt-hours to 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours.

    Machinery production can be doubled in five years, and the chemical industry can be increased by more than double.

    In 1954, the agricultural machinery we produce can reach three and a half times that of 1949, tractors can reach two and a half times that of 1949, and trucks and buses can reach twice that of 1949.

    The large expansion of the production of housing construction materials makes large-scale construction possible. The annual production of cement can be increased from 400,000 tons to 1 million tons, and the production of bricks can be tripled.

    The consumer goods industry will be greatly increased. In five years, the annual production value of food production will increase by 50%, the textile industry will increase by 56%, the clothing industry will increase by 63%, the leather industry will increase by 65%, and the paper and printing industry will increase by 50%, and the timber industry will increase by 60%.

    The cotton cloth production in 1949 was 160 million meters, and it can be increased to 240 million meters in 1954. We will be able to produce 40 million meters of wool fabric, while we can only produce 25 million meters now. We will be able to manufacture 9 million pairs of shoes, while we can only make 6 million pairs now.

    Doubling the printing paper and increasing the newspapers by 50% can make culture accessible to the masses.

    Within five years, we can manufacture 1 million bicycles, 85,000 motorcycles, 120,000 sewing machines, and 500,000 radios, along with other items.

    Due to the result of our industrial development and transformation, the order of precedence of several industrial sectors in our entire industrial production will change.

    The steel, iron, and machinery production in 1954 will be 34%, while it was only 20% in 1938.

    The chemical industry in 1938 was 9.8%, but it will be 14% in 1954.

    Electricity production, which accounts for 3.7% of the total industrial production, will increase to 4.5%.

    Many factories, workshops, and enterprise companies will be built within the Five-Year Plan.

    A large-scale hardware foundry will be built in Mohács.

    In Borsod, we will build a new factory to manufacture high-grade steel, and another one to manufacture freight car wheels.

    A new steel bridge frame manufacturing plant will be set up in Köszeg.

    A large-scale electrical machinery factory, an agricultural machinery manufacturing factory, and six power stations will be built.

    In the steel, iron, and machinery industries, we will build 20 new factories that can employ 200,000 workers.

    We will build a new fertilizer factory, a soda factory in Bükkszék, five textile factories, and twelve clothing factories.

    We will manufacture industrial products that our country did not have before, such as harvesters, diesel tractors, tractor-drawn seeders, tractor-drawn corn harvesters, large railway cranes, construction and road excavators, new-style machine tools, textile machinery, and other large equipment.

    In order to meet the labor force of our rapidly developing industrial production, and to fill the vacancies left by the promotion of tens of thousands of workers to leadership positions in administrative, economic, and cultural departments, we will need 300,000 new workers.

    Under the Five-Year Plan, factories and workshops will be located in backward agricultural areas, and industry will be located along the Danube and Tisza rivers, and in cities far from the Danube that lack industry, and thirteen cities will become industrial centers.

    In addition to the industrial center of Greater Budapest, there will be two other heavy industry concentration points: the Borsod and Bács-Kiskun-Mohács area.

    The Five-Year Plan will change the social and economic forms of the country.

            A Modern and Highly Developed Transportation System

    At the end of the Five-Year Plan, our transportation network will transport one and a half times more goods than in 1949. Investing in transportation will make this plan possible, allowing for the construction of new railways, the improvement and extension of existing railways to modernize them, increasing the number of vehicles, building new roads and bridges, and developing water and land transportation.

    We will build the railway from Mohács to Bátaszék, electrify the trunk line from Budapest to Miskolc, and build five bridges over the Danube River. In addition, four bridges will be built over the Tisza River, and a concrete highway from Budapest to Mohács.

    We will build 2,500 kilometers of good branch roads and establish 60 long-distance bus lines. Several provincial capitals will have buses, and 650 million forints will be spent on developing Budapest's transportation alone within five years, and we will build the first six-and-a-half-kilometer-long Budapest subway.

    Trolleybuses will run in Budapest and Miskolc.

    In 1954, our transportation volume will exceed 65% of that in 1938.

            We Will End the Backwardness of Our Countryside

    In order to end the backwardness of our agriculture, we will significantly increase agricultural harvests and livestock.

    After five years, grain harvests will increase by 27%. In order to achieve this goal, we will increase the harvest of state-owned farms by 80%, the harvest of cooperative farms by 35%, and the harvest of private farms by 11%. The wheat harvest per hold (equal to 0.575 hectares) will increase by an average of 7 quintals (a unit of weight, different in different countries, from 100 pounds to 220 pounds) to 8.5 dans, sugar beets from 100 dans to 130 dans, and alfalfa from 18 dans to 25 dans.

    In order to improve alkaline and acidic soils, 200 million forints will be invested in improving orchards, vineyards, and nurseries.

    We will introduce new crops such as cotton, which can provide our textile industry with a large amount of cotton.

    In order to maintain and increase the fertility of the land, we will make full use of the results of agricultural research and increase the application of artificial fertilizers. The production of superphosphate will increase fourfold, and the production of nitrate will increase three and a half times. In order to overcome periodic droughts, we will build new irrigation projects and renovate old ones, so that within five years, we can increase 200,000 holds of newly irrigated land: 125,000 acres outside the Tisza River and 240,000 acres between the Danube and Tisza Rivers. This plan will cost 620 million forints. We will plant 240,000 holds of forests, partly in alkaline land and sandy land. The funds for dredging and flood control will be 280 million forints.

    The number of livestock will increase from 1,882,000 heads in 1938 to 2,400,000 heads in 1954, the number of cattle will increase from 917,000 heads to 1,270,000 heads, the number of pigs will increase from 5,200,000 heads to 6,000,000 heads, and the number of poultry will double. The meat, fat, milk, and eggs produced by livestock and poultry will increase by 50%. In order to ensure that the amount of meat, fat, milk, and eggs increases by half, the fields for planting fodder will increase from 1 million holds to 1.4 million holds.

    In order to expand the fields for fodder, the irrigated grassland will be greatly increased. In order to increase the number of fertile livestock, 30 million forints will be mainly used to import purebred livestock, and 1 million forints will be used to improve livestock hygiene standards.

    One of the most important ways to improve agricultural harvests is the mechanization of agriculture, which can improve cultivation. For this reason, 30 million forints will be invested in the mechanization of agriculture in the next five years. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, the government will have 42,000 new tractors, 4,000 new threshers, and 1,400 harvesters. Within five years, another 260,000 small machines will be used in agriculture. In 1954, 60% of the cultivated land, including 6 million holds of fields, will be cultivated by tractors.

    Within five years, the number of machine stations will increase from the current 130 to 500, and the number of tractors will increase from 1,300 to 20,000. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, the number of workers working in machine stations will increase to 600,000, of which 400,000 will be tractor drivers and experts trained from peasants.

    Within five years, state-owned farms will develop into an important economic force. In 1954, they will have 2,500 tractors and 8% of the total number of livestock in the country. Within five years, the number of cattle will increase sixfold, and the number of pigs will increase twofold. In 1954, they will account for 12% of the salable grain, and the harvest of state-owned farms will be greatly increased, so the wheat harvest of state-owned farms in 1954 will average 15 dans per hold, while it is only 8.5 dans now.

    In order to increase and develop cooperative production, within five years, we will invest 1.2 billion forints, of which 160 million will be used for machines, 560 million for farm buildings (stables, fodder stacks, granaries, warehouses, manure stations), 135 million for planting plants, and 60 million for breeding livestock.

    In the course of the Five-Year Plan, machine stations, state-owned farms, and cooperatives will dramatically change rural life and social conditions.

    The Five-Year Plan is also a plan to promote rural culture. Within five years, 1.2 billion forints will be used to meet the cultural needs of peasants. Under the Five-Year Plan, 300 million forints will be used to electrify 1,500 places, and efforts will be made to make every place like this. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, every village in Hungary will have electricity, radios, and telephones for use, so that peasants can be connected with cultural life.

    Within five years, 160 million forints will be used for specialized agricultural education, establishing rural cultural centers, and establishing public libraries.

    More than 40,000 peasants (if tractor drivers are counted together, then more than 80,000) will be trained as agricultural specialists, of which 14,000 will enter agricultural colleges and universities. The science of agricultural organization and agricultural management will no longer be the monopoly of the slaves of landlords.

    In the course of the Five-Year Plan, we will build hundreds of central dormitories for farmers who live far from the farms, of which 245 can have running water, dig 2,000 new wells, and establish 400 health stations, 300 public bathrooms, and 400 sports fields.

    In terms of culture and health, the countryside will not be neglected as it was in the past.

            Toward Prosperity

    As a result of the Five-Year Plan, the living standards of workers in 1954 will be 50% higher than in 1938 and 35% higher than in 1939. This improvement in living standards can be guaranteed by the 40% increase in the production of household goods within five years.

    Meat consumption can be increased from 25 kilograms per person in 1949 to 34 kilograms in 1954, fat consumption can be increased from 10 kilograms to 14.5 kilograms, milk and cheese consumption can be increased from 127 liters to 200 liters, sugar consumption can be increased from 17 kilograms to 22 kilograms, cotton cloth consumption from 14 meters to 22.5 meters, wool fabric consumption from 1.3 meters to 2.6 meters, and shoes from 0.6 pairs to 1 pair.

    Within five years, 65,000 houses will be built with public funds.

    The Five-Year Plan can enable 300,000 people to enjoy public entertainment venues every year to 500,000, unemployment will be eliminated, and the working class will no longer be threatened by unemployment.

    The Five-Year Plan has taken a big step forward on the path to improving people's lives.

            Our Greatest Wealth—The People

    The Five-Year Plan allocates a considerable amount of funds for health and welfare undertakings for the families of those who work, especially urban workers, to improve their work output.

    Within five years, 1 billion forints will be used for social welfare and health undertakings. We will establish hospitals and maternity and child care centers, and expand existing ones. The number of hospital beds will increase by 9,000, which is 10% more than in 1938. There are currently 2.4 maternity beds per 10,000 people. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, this number will increase to 3.8. We will develop maternity and child welfare undertakings and establish 280 new factory clinics, bringing the total number to 480. The establishment of 360 new day care centers and 250 new nurseries can provide daytime care for 200,000 toddlers and 100,000 infants.

    The Five-Year Plan will realize the principle that the greatest wealth of the people's government is the people.

            A Cultured and Powerful Nation in a Free and Independent Motherland

    In the Five-Year Plan, 2.5 billion forints will be used for cultural undertakings.

    We will ensure that every child can indeed attend an eight-year general school, increase the number of children of workers and peasants attending secondary schools, and train 100,000 new specialists to participate in the leadership departments of administration, economy, and culture to work.

    We will establish 2,000 new general school classrooms, bringing the total number to 22,700, an increase of 10%. We will earnestly improve teaching methods. 4,000 general schools will have chemistry laboratories and experimental equipment to teach physics, 3,000 schools will have radios, and 1,000 schools will have dining halls and kitchen equipment for cooking.

    We will expand industrial schools, increase the number of apprentices in large factories from 14,000 to 44,000, establish new-style industrial schools connected with large factories, apprentice workshops, and provide dormitories for apprentices who live in other areas. We will thoroughly improve secondary schools under the Three-Year Plan: we will establish new secondary schools, mainly in the industrial area and the capital city's Angyalföld and Árpád areas.

    In people's universities, we will solve the problem of food and accommodation for 38,000 students, mainly children of workers and peasants.

    Under the Five-Year Plan, we will train 10,000 teachers and establish four normal colleges.

    Due to the increase in construction, we will complete the plan to build universities, modernize equipment, and expand them.

    Within five years, we will spend 250 million forints to develop existing scientific research institutes and build new ones, establish a Central Academy of Sciences, an Academy of Organic Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry, an Academy of Agricultural Mechanization, an Academy of Agricultural Chemistry and Agricultural Biology, an Academy of Economics, etc. We will establish a new technical university specializing in the study of heavy industry technology. This university, together with some existing industrial universities, can train 1,600 specialists every year for the development of the national economy.

    Our people's democratic government is making great efforts to cultivate Hungarian art. Under the Five-Year Plan, we will establish a new national theater to replace the old one and develop it into one of the most important centers of Hungarian dramatic art and Hungarian culture as a whole. The Five-Year Plan will increase the number of libraries and reduce the price of books so that a wider audience can access them. In order to promote cultural education, we will continue to develop film production.

    We will complete the construction of the People's Stadium in Budapest, which can accommodate 700,000 spectators and is worth 30 million forints. In the course of the Five-Year Plan, the funds used for sports will increase from 120 million forints per year to 240 million, not counting investments in sports.

    The Five-Year Plan is the road leading our people's democratic government to a prosperous, powerful, and cultured socialist Hungary! (Attached picture)

　　匈牙利五年计划
    李泽澜译
    三年计划完成后完成了建设时期
    三年计划将提前七个月在一九四九年终完成，意思就是将在两年零五个月内完成这个计划，而必须起草一个新的经济方案。
    这个三年计划是一个建设和复兴被战争所破坏的匈牙利的经济的计划。
    这个建设和复兴的计划增加了匈牙利的财富，干兹电器厂、干兹货车厂和干兹造船厂都增添了新的作场。在柏特地方成立了一个硝酸盐厂，在马塔成立了一个电力站，一个新的国有纺织厂成立了。到处开辟了道路，电化乡村的工作已经开始……。
    据初步统计，三年计划里关于工厂、矿产和五金铸造厂的生产是一百八十七亿佛罗林（匈牙利的标准货币单位，约合美金八分五厘）。根据目前的结果看来，毫无疑问，在一九四九年底这个数字会变为一百九十亿。因此，三年计划里，关于工厂、矿产及五金铸造厂将百分之百地提前七个月完成。有些工业部门，特别是重工业及机械业，已确实超过三年计划的目标。但是另外某些部门，主要是轻工业，生产方面，有少许迟缓。在农业方面，假定说是一九四九年的收获还差强人意的话，那么我们可以达到三年计划所规定的目标。生活水准也已超过预期的水平。
    不管帝国主义们的捣乱，我们还是获得了大的成就。匈牙利的工人阶级、农民、知识分子以及小商人都了解这个计划的重要性，而不惜任何力量来完成它。
    三年前，工厂、矿产和五金铸造厂几乎是完全属于资本家所有的，但现在已有百分之八十七掌握在人民政权的手里。
    三年前，银行差不多完全被控制在资本家的手里，但现在已经是在国家的掌握之中了。
    三年前，对外贸易几乎完全为资本家所把持，但现在却是百分之百地由国家来经营了。
    三年前，批发贸易几乎全为资本家所掌握，但现在国家掌握了它的百分之七十五。
    三年前，关于零售贸易，国家和合作社的股份仅占百分之三，但现在却占百分之二十了。
    三年前，千百万农民在最大的经济困难情形下来奋斗、来耕种，同时又担心田地被大地主们所收回，或是担心仍然坠入富农们高利贷的罗网。然而我们的人民民主政权保护了我们的农民，同时机器站又给他们大的帮助。一九四九年终，全国将有二百所机器站和三千五百架拖拉机。小型生产仍在农业中占重要地位，但是生产合作运动已很好地树立起来了。
    在三年之内，我们的国家已确确实实地发展成为工人和农人的国家了。在我们的国家里，政权是操在与农人联盟的工人阶级的手里。
    三年计划完成后，建设与复兴时期将可结束。新时期将要开始，即经济改变和发展时期。三年计划已准备了一切条件，容许我们去完成已经开始的各项工作，不仅是在工业上而且还在农业上与贸易上打下了社会主义的基础。因此我们需要一个五年计划。
            一个转变与更进一步地发展国家经济的计划
    五年计划主要的任务是：
    （一）加速进行匈牙利的工业化，尤其是发展重工业及工程，因为这是发展轻工业、农业机械化以及现代化运输的决定条件。
    （二）消除我们农业上的落后性及确切增加它的生产来供给我们正在增加的人口的足够的粮食，保证正在生长的工业及满足国家经济的进口需要。
    （三）提高我们人民的生活水准，这是由工业化及重新组织农业所保证的。
    （四）结束过去统治阶级的教育专利政策及创造为发展工人阶级及其联盟——农人——的文化的必需条件，训练新的工农出身的领导者（工程师、医生、教员、经济及工业的组织者及经理、军官、公务员等）来指挥行政、经济及文化建设。
    （五）创造有决定性的条件，以逐渐消灭城市与乡村之间的区别。
    （六）发展我们的国防及守卫部队来保卫我们的独立，和苏联、友好的人民民主政权及世界上爱好自由的人民来保卫和平、反对战争贩子。
    五年计划的结果，可使社会主义的生产在国家经济中占一优越的地位。
    为了要完成这些目标，在五年之内，我们将投资三百五十亿佛罗林，其中一百七十亿将投资到工业，六十亿投资到农业（应该加上直接对于农业有利的工业、运输、卫生、文化组织、建设等，关于乡村的投资总数约为六十亿佛罗林），六十亿投资到运输，三十五亿投资到社会及文化事业，二十五亿将投资到建设房屋方面。
    总共三百五十亿的投资，其中一百四十亿左右将分配给建筑房屋方面。
    确切实行这个计划，可以由我们每年都在增加的国家收入及一九五四年的国家收入将为一九四九年的百分之一百六十这个事实来保证完成。还有关于正在增加的工业生产大约在五年内可以达到百分之四十。关于工业生产成本的减低，大约在五年以内可以达到保证这个计划的切实实行。
    工业生产品的价值（包括矿产及冶金），如果和一九四九年相比，在一九五四年将增加百分之八十，因而可以把工业生产提高到一九三八年的百分之二百三十。
    一九五四年农业生产品的价值比一九四九年多百分之三十五，因而可以把农业生产提高到一九三八年的百分之一百二十七。
    每年工厂、矿产和五金铸造厂的生产在五年内可以从一百八十亿佛罗林提高到三百四十亿。
            经过工业化而达到社会主义
    生产可以用于再生产的机器的工业比例，可以在五年内从年产的百分之四十八提高到百分之五十三，因而可使重工业及工程在工业中占优势。
    钢铁的产量可从一千一百万吨提高到一千八百万吨。
    电力产量可从二十二亿基罗瓦特提高到四十二亿基罗瓦特。
    机械生产在五年内可以增加一倍，化学工业则可增加不止一倍。
    一九五四年我们所出产的农业机械可以达到一九四九年的三倍半，拖拉机可以达到一九四九年的两倍半，货车和公共汽车可以达到一九四九年的两倍。
    大量的扩充房屋建筑材料的生产，使进行大量的建筑成为可能。水泥的年产可以从四十万吨提高到一百万吨，至于砖的产量可以提高三倍。
    消费品工业将大为增加。在五年内，食物生产的年产价值将增加百分之五十，纺织工业将增加百分之五十六，衣服工业将增加百分之六十三，皮革工业将增加百分之六十五，造纸及印刷业将增加百分之五十，木材工业将增加百分之六十。
    一九四九年棉布产量是一亿六千万公尺，在一九五四年可增加到两亿四千万公尺。我们将能生产四千万公尺的呢绒，而现在却仅能生产二千五百万公尺。我们将能制造九百万双鞋子，而现在却只能制六百万双。
    印刷纸张增加一倍及报纸增加百分之五十可使文化为广大群众所接受。
    五年内，连同其他物件在内，我们可以制造一百万辆自行车，八万五千辆摩托自行车，十二万架缝纫机及五十万座收音机。
    由于我们的工业发展和转变的结果，若干工业部门在我们全部工业生产中的先后次序将有所改变。
    一九五四年的钢、铁及机械生产将为百分之三十四，而在一九三八年仅为百分之二十。
    一九三八年的化学工业是百分之九·八，但在一九五四年将为百分之十四。
    占工业总生产量百分之三·七的电力生产将提高为百分之四·五。
    在五年计划内，将建筑许多工场、工厂及企业公司。
    一所大规模的五金铸造厂将在莫哈克斯建造起来。
    在波尔索德我们将建造一所新的工厂来制造高级钢，另外一所来制造货车车轮。
    一所新的钢质桥梁架制造厂将设在克塞伯尔。
    一所大规模的电气机器厂，一所农业机器制造厂，和六所电力站将要建筑起来。
    在钢、铁和机械工业方面，我们将建造能雇用二十万工人的二十所新工厂。
    我们将建造一所新的肥料厂，一所苏达厂在布克斯兹克，五所纺织厂和十二所被服厂。
    我们将制造以前我们国家所没有的工业品，如收获机、柴油拖拉机，用拖拉机牵引的播种机，用拖拉机牵引的玉蜀黍收割机，大型铁路起重机，建筑及开路的开掘机，新式机械工具，纺织业机器，以及其他大的装备。
    为了要满足我们很快在发展着的工业生产劳动力，以及补充由于数万工人被提升充任行政、经济及文化部门的领导地位后所留下的空额，我们将需要三十万的新工人。
    在五年计划下，工厂、工场将设在落后的农业区域中，工业将在多瑙河及的萨河，和在远离多瑙河而缺乏工业的城市，有十三个城市将变为工业中心。
    除了工业中心的大布达佩斯外，另外将有两个重工业的集中点：波尔索德及伯克斯——莫哈克斯区。
    五年计划将改变全国的社会和经济形式。
            一个现代化的高度发展的运输制度
    五年计划的终了，我们的运输网将运输较一九四九年多一倍半的货物。由于投资于运输可使这个计划变为可能，可以建筑新的铁路，改进及延长现有的铁路，使成现代化，增加车辆，建筑新路和桥梁，以及发展水陆交通。
    我们将建筑从莫哈克斯到巴塔斯兹克的铁路，电化从布达佩斯到米斯柯尔克的干线，在多瑙河上建筑五座桥梁。另外还有将建筑在的萨河上的四座桥，从布达佩斯到莫哈克斯的水泥公路。
    我们将建筑二千五百公里的好的支路，建立六十条长途汽车线。有几个省会城市将行驶公共汽车，仅在发展布达佩斯交通方面将在五年内花费六亿五千万佛罗林，我们将建筑第一条六公里半长的布达佩斯地下铁道。
    布达佩斯和米斯柯尔克将行驶无轨电车。
    一九五四年我们的运输量将超过一九三八年的百分之六十五。
            我们将结束我们乡村的落后性
    为了要结束我们农业的落后性，我们将切实增加农产收获及牲畜。
    五年后，粮食收成将增加百分之二十七。为了要达到这个目的，我们将使国有农场的收成增加百分之八十，合作社的农场的收成增加百分之三十五，私人农场的收成增加百分之十一。麦子的收成每荷尔德（等于○·五七五公顷）将平均增加七昆特尔（一种重量单位，各国不同，自一百磅至二百二十磅）至八担半，甜菜从一百担增加到一百三十担，苜蓿自十八担增加到二十五担。
    为了改良碱性和酸性的土质，两亿佛罗林将投资在改进果园、葡萄园和苗圃上。
    我们将介绍新的种植物如棉花，它可以供给我们纺织工业大量的棉花。
    为了要保持及增加土地的肥沃，我们将尽量利用关于农业研究的结果以及增加对于人造肥料的应用。关于超级磷矿的生产将增加四倍，硝酸盐的生产将增加三倍半。为了要克服周期性的旱灾，我们将建造新的灌溉工程和整理旧的，这样在五年内，可以增加二十万荷尔德的新灌溉的土地：在的萨河以外是十二万五千亩，在多瑙河与的萨河之间是二十四万亩。这个计划将用款六亿二千万佛罗林。我们将种植廿四万荷尔德的森林，一部分在碱性的土地和沙地上。用于疏浚和防止水灾方面的款项将为二亿八千万佛罗林。
    牲畜的数目将自一九三八年的一百八十八万二千头增加到一九五四年的二百四十万头，牛的数目将自九十一万七千头增加到一百二十七万头，猪的数目将自五百二十万头增加到六百万头，家禽的数目将增加一倍。牲畜和家禽所产生的肉、脂肪、牛羊乳和蛋将增加百分之五十。为了要保证肉、脂肪、牛羊肉和蛋的数量增加一半，种植刍秣的田亩将自一百万荷尔德增加到一百四十万荷尔德。
    为了要扩充刍秣的田亩，灌溉的草地将大为增加。为了要增加能生育的牲畜的数目，三千万佛罗林将主要地用于输入纯种的牲口，一百万佛罗林将用于提高牲畜的卫生标准。
    提高农业收获最重要的方法之一是农业的机械化，这样可以改进耕种。为了这种关系，在未来五年中将有三千万佛罗林投资到农业的机械化的事业上。五年计划的终了，政府将掌握四万二千架新的拖拉机，四千架新的打谷机，一千四百架收获机。在五年之内，另有二十六万只小机械将用于农业。一九五四年百分之六十的耕地，包括六百万荷尔德的田亩，将用拖拉机来耕种。
    五年内，机器站的数目将从目前的一百三十增加到五百，拖拉机从一千三百架增加到二万架。五年计划的终了，在机器站工作的工人将增加到六十万名，其中四十万为从农民中训练出来的拖拉机驾驶员和专家。
    五年内，国家农场将发展成为一个重要的经济力量。一九五四年他们将具备二千五百架拖拉机，有占全国总数百分之八的牲口。在五年内，牛的数目将增加六倍，猪的数目增加二倍。在一九五四年，他们将占有可出售粮食的百分之十二，国家农场的收获将大为增加，所以在一九五四年国家农场的麦子收成将平均为每荷尔德十五担，而现在却只有八担半。
    为了要增加和发展合作生产，在五年内，我们将投资十二亿佛罗林，其中一亿六千万用于机器，五亿六千万用于农场建筑（马厩、秣草栈、谷仓、仓库、粪站），一亿三千五百万用于种植植物，六千万用于培育牲口。
    在五年计划的进行中，机器站、国家农场及合作社将剧烈地改变乡村生活和社会状况。
    五年计划也是促进乡村文化的一种计划。五年内将有十二亿佛罗林用来满足农民对文化的需要。在五年计划下，将用三亿佛罗林来电化一千五百个地方，并将设法使每个地方都如此。五年计划的终了，匈牙利每个乡村将有电力、收音机、电话可供使用，这样可以把农民和文化生活连系起来。
    五年内，将有一亿六千万佛罗林用于专门农业教育，建立乡村文化中心和设立公共图书馆。
    四万余农民（如连拖拉机驾驶员算在一起，则为八万余名），将被训练为农业专门人材，其中一万四千名将入农学院和大学。农业组织和农业管理的科学，将不再是大地主们奴隶总管的专利品了。
    在五年计划的进行中，我们将为远离农场的农人们建立千百个中心宿舍，其中二百四十五个可以有自来水使用，挖掘二千个新井，设立四百个卫生站，三百个公共浴室，四百个运动场。
    在文化和健康方面，乡村也不会像过去那样地被忽视了。
            走向繁荣
    由于进行五年计划的结果，一九五四年的工人生活水准将较一九三八年提高百分之五十，较一九三九年提高百分之三十五。这个生活水准的提高可由在五年内由于家庭用品的生产的提高百分之四十所保证的。
    肉的消耗可由一九四九年的每人二十五公斤提高到一九五四年的三十四公斤，脂肪的消耗可由十公斤提高到十四公斤半，牛乳及乳酪的消耗可由一百二十七公升提高到二百公升，糖的消耗可由十七公斤提高到二十二公斤，棉布消耗由十四公尺提高到二十二公尺半，呢绒消耗可由一·三公尺到二·六公尺，鞋从○·六双至一双。
    在五年内，将用公款建筑六万五千所住宅。
    五年计划可以使每年三十万人享用公共娱乐场所提到五十万，失业将被消除，工人阶级将不再受失业的威胁。
    五年计划使我们向改善人民生活的途径上迈进了一大步。
            我们最大的财富——人民
    五年计划为那些工作人员的眷属，特别是城市工人，拨了一笔可观的卫生和福利事业的款子，来提高他们的工作产量。
    五年中，十亿佛罗林将用于社会福利及健康事业。我们将建立医院和妇孺保育院，同时扩充现有的，医院的病床将增加九千只，较一九三八年多百分之十。目前一万人中有二·四只妇产床铺，五年计划的终了，这个数目将增加到三·八。我们将发展妇孺福利事业，设立二百八十个新的工厂医务所，使总数提高到四百八十个。三百六十个新的日间托儿所和二百五十个新的育婴堂的建立可以在日间托管二十万名初学走路的孩子和十万名婴儿。
    五年计划将使人民政权最大的财富是人民这个原则得到实现。
            一个有文化的、强大的民族在一个自由与独立的祖国里
    在五年计划中，二十五亿佛罗林将用于文化事业方面。
    我们将使每个儿童能确实入八年制的普通学校就读，增加在中等学校就读的工、农子弟的数目，训练十万名新的专门人材参加行政、经济及文化方面的领导部门去工作。
    我们将设立二千间新的普通学校的教室使其总数达到二万二千七百，即增加百分之十。我们将认真地来改进教授法，四千所普通学校将有化学实验室和实验设备用来教授物理，三千所学校将有收音机，一千所学校将有膳堂、厨房设备用以烹饪。
    我们将扩充工业学校，增加在大工厂里的学徒数目从一万四千名到四万四千名，建立与大工厂发生连系的新型工业学校，学徒工场，又将供给那些住在他区学徒们的宿舍。我们将在三年计划下彻底改进中等学校：我们将建立新的中等学校，主要的在工业区和国都所在地的安基亚富尔德和阿巴达区。
    在人民大学中，我们将为三万八千名学生，主要的是工农子弟，解决食宿问题。
    在五年计划下，我们将训练一万名教师，设立四所师范学院。
    由于建筑的增加，我们将完成建设大学，使设备现代化而加以扩充的计划。
    五年内，我们将花二亿五千万佛罗林来发展现有的科学研究院和建造新的，建立一所中央科学院，有机化学与无机化学学院，农业机械化学院，农业化学与农业生物学学院，经济学院等。我们将建立一所新的专门研究重工业技术的工科大学，这所大学和现有的一些工业大学，可以每年训练一千六百名专门人材为发展国家经济之用。
    我们的人民民主政权正在作很大的努力来培养匈牙利的艺术。在五年计划下，我们将建立一所新的国家戏院来代替旧的，并使之发展成为匈牙利最重要的戏剧艺术及匈牙利整个文化中心之一。五年计划将增加图书馆的数目和减低书籍的价格来使更广大的群众能接受它。为了要提倡文化教育，我们仍将发展影片的摄制。
    我们将完成在布达佩斯的人民运动场之建造，该场可容纳七十万观众，价值三千万佛罗林。在五年计划的进行中，用于体育的经费将从每年一亿二千万佛罗林提高为二亿四千万，尚不计算关于体育之投资。
    五年计划是领导我们人民民主政权走向富裕的、强大的、文化的社会主义的匈牙利的大道！（附图片）
