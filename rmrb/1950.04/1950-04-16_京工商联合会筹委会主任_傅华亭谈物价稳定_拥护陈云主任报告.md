　　Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Director
    Fu Huating Discusses Price Stability and Supports Director Chen Yun's Report
    [This Newspaper] Beijing—Fu Huating, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently made a statement, believing that price stability is beneficial to the legitimate operation of industry and commerce. He also expressed his firm support for the financial and economic measures of the Central People's Government. He said: "After we read Director Chen Yun's report on the financial and food situation and Chairman Mao's speech in the newspaper, the industrial and commercial circles in the capital unanimously expressed their support and are determined to assist the government in overcoming the difficulties in the transition. Due to twelve years of inflation, legitimate industry and commerce have been greatly weakened. Having experienced much pain, they naturally unanimously support the epoch-making price stability in the future. How industry and commerce should change their business policies in operation, cooperate with the government's economic plans, and be careful in expenditures, reduce waste, reduce costs, and improve quality are all things that should be learned. Reversing the past abnormal economic state and moving towards normal operations is now a good opportunity. Prices have gradually declined in recent days, but if they continue to decline to the point of affecting production, the government will take appropriate steps to stabilize them. The report's instructions on how to make the burden fair and reasonable and how to coordinate between public and private sectors are precisely the truths that the current industrial and commercial circles want to speak. However, we must actively educate ourselves and organize ourselves in order to achieve the goal of benefiting both public and private interests and prospering the economy."

　　京工商联合会筹委会主任
    傅华亭谈物价稳定  拥护陈云主任报告
    【本报讯】北京市工商联合会筹委会主任傅华亭顷发表谈话，认为物价稳定，有利于正当工商业经营。并表示坚决拥护中央人民政府的财经措施，他说：“我们在报上看到了陈云主任关于财政状况和粮食状况的报告和毛主席的讲话以后，首都的工商界一致表示拥护，并坚决要协助政府共同努力克服转变中的困难。由于十二年来的通货膨胀，正当工商业已经大大削弱了。经历了许多痛苦，当然对于今后划时代的物价稳定一致表示拥护。工商业今后如何在经营上转变业务方针，配合政府经济计划及在开支中精打细算，减少浪费，减低成本，提高质量，都是应该学习的。扭转过去的畸形经济状态，走向正常的经营，现在正是一个好的机会。近日物价逐渐下降，但如继续下降而致影响生产时，政府将要采取适当步骤，使之步向稳定。对报告中所指示的如何使负担公平合理，及公私间如何配合等问题，正是目前工商业界要说的实话。不过我们必须积极的教育自己，组织自己，才能达到公私兼顾繁荣经济的目的。”
