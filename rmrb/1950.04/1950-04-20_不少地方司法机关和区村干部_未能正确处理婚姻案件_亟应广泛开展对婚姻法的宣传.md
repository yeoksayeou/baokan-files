(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) According to reports from various regions: To relieve women from the suffering of unfree marriages, it is necessary to strengthen extensive publicity and policy education against the feudal marriage system and for the establishment of a new democratic marriage system, so that everyone can understand the correct meaning of freedom of marriage. At present, not only rural women are generally demanding freedom of marriage, but also urban women, due to the gradual implementation of various democratic policies by the People's Government, are increasingly demanding to be freed from the suffering of unfree marriages. However, judicial departments and district/village cadres in many places have not yet correctly understood this issue, and therefore have not given it the attention it deserves, creating serious obstacles to the realization of freedom of marriage.

According to reports from various regions, many local judicial departments or district/village cadres are simply not handling marriage cases at all, or are delaying their handling. For example, the judicial department of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, received a total of 176 marriage cases last year, but only handled 39 of them; the Second District of Fengrun has not handled a single case in the past two years; in Xidayu Village, Eighth District of Ji County, a woman asked the Women's Federation for help with a divorce twice, but was delayed by the Women's Federation, which led to her suicide. In Tonghua County, Liaodong Province, many district/village cadres even refuse to write letters of introduction for women, making it impossible for them to appeal to the county government. Some places, although they handle cases, are extremely careless, and without asking whether reconciliation is still possible, they hastily grant divorces or force reconciliation. For example, in Fengzhen and Jining counties in the Suiyuan New District, cases were handled in a way that every request was granted and approvals were given casually, resulting in chaotic divorces, causing dissatisfaction and even panic among farmers. Some mechanically emphasize that marriage problems within the peasantry should be resolved through reconciliation as much as possible, and those who should be divorced are not allowed to divorce, resulting in tragic deaths. In addition, in some places in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, cadres, when handling marriage cases, disregard the difficulties women face after divorce, consider it unreasonable for them to remarry with property, not only do not provide appropriate alimony, but even demand that women return wedding gifts. Some district/village cadres in Yishui and Cangshan, Shandong, confuse adultery with marriage problems, and regardless of whether the marriage is reasonable and whether the woman is dissatisfied with the marriage, they simply say that the woman was originally improper and do not allow a divorce.

The Ideological Style of Certain Local Cadres Who Disregard and Suppress Women Should Be Changed

The main reason for the above phenomena is that the ideological style of these local cadres, who disregard and even suppress women, has not changed, they turn a blind eye to the evils of the feudal marriage system, and they do not study marriage policies carefully. According to the second issue of "New Chinese Women," in divorce cases in general old liberated area rural areas, 50 to 80 percent are filed by women. According to another statistic, 85 percent of marriage cases in Fengzhen County, Suiyuan New District, in the past half year were also filed by women. Among those filed by women in cities, Beijing and Tianjin accounted for two-thirds, and Wuhan accounted for 80 percent. Moreover, the filing of these cases is mostly due to unbearable abuse by mothers-in-law and husbands, or arranged marriages by parents where there is a large age gap and no emotional compatibility. For example, according to statistics from Handan Special District, Hebei Province, over five months, 80 percent of marriage cases were related to arranged marriages, and according to statistics from Tonghua County, Liaodong Province, arranged marriages accounted for as much as 90 percent in one year. These figures clearly show how deeply women are bound by the feudal marriage system and how urgent women's demands for freedom of marriage are; however, many local cadres turn a blind eye to this, do not carefully study policies, and even have feudal ideas themselves, so that they obstruct the realization of women's freedom of marriage in all aspects. Some cadres in Hebei and Henan mistakenly believe that it is not easy for poor households to marry a wife, and that they have spent a lot of money, so if a divorce is granted, they will lose their "standpoint," not understanding that the wife of a poor household is also a poor woman; they cannot only take care of the hopes of the poor man and sacrifice the physical and spiritual freedom of the poor woman.

Based on the above situation, in order to relieve women from the suffering of unfree marriages, it is necessary to carry out extensive publicity and policy education on the implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China and the opposition to the feudal marriage system among the broad masses of cadres and people.

### 不少地方司法机关和区村干部  未能正确处理婚姻案件  亟应广泛开展对婚姻法的宣传

　　不少地方司法机关和区村干部
    未能正确处理婚姻案件
    亟应广泛开展对婚姻法的宣传
    【新华社十九日讯】据各地报道：要解除妇女婚姻不自由的痛苦，必须加强反对封建婚姻制度与建立新民主主义婚姻制度的广泛宣传与政策教育，使人人都能了解婚姻自由的正确意义。目前，不仅是农村妇女普遍要求婚姻自由，即城市妇女由于人民政府各项民主政策的逐步实施，要求解除婚姻不自由的痛苦者也与日俱增。但不少地方司法部门与区村干部，对待这一问题尚无正确认识，因而未能引起应有的重视，造成实现婚姻自由的严重障碍。
    据各地报道，目前不少地方司法部门或区村干部对婚姻案件根本不加处理，或拖延处理。例如河北省遵化县司法部门，去年共收到婚姻案件一百七十六件，只处理了三十九件；丰润二区两年来尚未处理一件；蓟县八区西大峪村一个妇女两次请求妇联会帮助离婚，为妇联会拖延，竟致自杀。辽东省通化县很多区村干部，竟不给妇女写介绍信，使之无法向县政府上诉。有些地方虽加处理，但极不慎重，不问是否还能和解，即行草率判离或强行和解。例如绥远新区丰镇、集宁等县，在处理案件时，有求必应，随便批准，结果发生乱离现象，引起农民不满，甚至恐慌。有的则机械强调农民内部婚姻问题应尽力和解，应离的不准离，以致酿成人命惨剧。此外，如河北、河南与山东有些地方干部，在处理婚姻案件时，不顾女方离婚后生活困难，认为带产改嫁不合理，不但不给适当赡养费用，甚至还要女方退回婚礼财物。山东沂水、苍山有些区村干部把奸情与婚姻问题混为一谈，不问该项婚姻是否合理及女方对婚姻不满情形，只说女方原来不正派而不许离婚。
    某些地方干部轻视妇女和压制妇女的思想作风应加改变
    产生上述现象的原因，主要的是这些地方干部轻视妇女甚至压制妇女的思想作风尚未改变，对封建婚姻制度的罪恶熟视无睹，对婚姻政策不加研究。据《新中国妇女》第二期载称，在一般老解放区农村的离婚案件中，有百分之五十至八十为女方提出。另据统计，在绥远新区丰镇县去年半年内的婚姻案件中，百分之八十五也是女方提出。在城市女方提出者，北京、天津占三分之二，武汉占百分之八十。而且这些案件的提出，又多因婆母、丈夫虐待不可忍受，或为父母包办买卖婚姻，而年龄悬殊、感情不合的。例如河北省邯郸专区五个月统计，婚姻案件中有百分之八十为买卖婚姻，辽东省通化县一年统计中买卖婚姻的甚至占百分之九十。这些数字显著说明妇女所受封建婚姻制度的束缚是如何深重以及妇女对婚姻自由的要求是如何迫切；但不少地方干部对此熟视无睹，又不仔细研究政策，甚至本身就带有封建的思想，以致从各方面阻挠妇女婚姻自由的实现。河北、河南有些地方干部错误地认为贫苦户娶妻不容易，花过很多钱，如果判决离婚，就失掉了“立场”，不了解贫苦户的妻，也是贫苦的妇女；不能只照顾贫苦男方的希望而牺牲贫苦女方的肉体上和精神上的自由权利。
    基于以上情况，要解除妇女婚姻不自由的痛苦，就必须在广大干部和群众中，开展实行中华人民共和国婚姻法和反对封建婚姻制度的广泛宣传与政策教育。
