　　Worldwide People Oppose US Imperialism's "Cold War" Conspiracy
    US "Overall Diplomacy" Doomed to Fail
    New Era Magazine Exposes US Imperialism's Foreign Political Strategy
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] TASS Moscow dispatch: The New Era magazine, in its recent editorial, commented on the US's foreign political strategy, stating: Washington's diplomatic activities have recently become so eye-catching that bourgeois newspapers are describing them as the State Department's "spring diplomatic offensive." Simultaneously with this offensive, rumors are being spread claiming that the US ruling clique intends to take steps to adjust US-Soviet relations. The magazine pointed out that this approach is intended to shift the responsibility for the complications and serious international forms of international relations caused by the US's war preparation policy onto the Soviet Union. This act of distorting the truth is a component of the US's foreign political strategy, which Acheson now likes to call "Overall Diplomacy." Acheson's announced "Overall Diplomacy," in his own words, essentially means the continuation of force and Cold War policies, to impose the will of the US on other countries, and to change the politics of the people's democratic countries in the way the US hopes. But this US policy has met with resolute and victorious resistance around the world. Its anti-people nature and the danger it poses to international security determine its failure. This is very clear to everyone.

　　全世界人民反对美帝“冷战”阴谋
    美“总体外交”注定失败
    新时代杂志揭露美帝对外政治战略
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志在最近一期的社论中，评论美国对外的政治战略称：华盛顿的外交活动近来已变成这样的惹人注目，以至资产阶级的报纸把它形容为国务院的“春季外交攻势”。与这一攻势同时，又散布谣言，说什么美国的统治集团有心采取步骤调整美苏关系。该杂志指出，这种做法，是为了把美国的战争准备政策所引起的国际关系复杂化与国际形式严重化的责任，推到苏联身上。这种歪曲真实情况的行为，乃是美国对外政治战略，即艾奇逊现在喜欢称之为“总体外交”的构成部分。艾奇逊所宣布的“总体外交”，照他本人的话来看，本质上是意味着武力与冷战政策之继续，要把美国的意志强加于其他国家之上，使人民民主国家的政治按照美国所希望的方式来改变。但美国这种政策，在世界各地遇到了坚决与胜利的反击。它的反人民性质和它给国际安全造成的危险，决定了它的失败。这是一切人都看得很清楚的。
