Hebei Organizes Military Dependents for Production
　　48 Counties Achieve Success in Substitute Farming

　　[This Newspaper reports] A message from Hebei Daily: To earnestly carry out substitute farming and organize military dependents for production, 48 counties in the special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Cangxian, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tongxian, Tangshan, and Tianjin have all, this spring, arranged and specifically discussed the work of military dependents' production and substitute farming through people's representative conferences at all levels. In early March, the Tongxian and Tangshan special districts also convened civil affairs meetings to conduct inspections. Some counties proposed striving to increase the yield of military dependents' land, aiming to achieve the same level as ordinary farmers, with general areas restoring to pre-war levels; individual areas that have already reached pre-war levels should strive to exceed them appropriately. In severely affected areas (excluding perennially waterlogged areas), the principle is to organize military dependents' production without delaying the farming season. Currently, throughout the province, whether in disaster areas or non-disaster areas, this work is generally taken seriously, and considerable achievements have been made.

　　In the spring plowing preparation, various localities actively helped military dependents accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure. In the 13th district of Ding County, 20 villages helped 676 households of labor-lacking revolutionary martyrs and military dependents haul 41,023 cartloads of bedding soil. In the Tangjiawan, Daxiao Nanmei and other four villages of Quyang County, 205 cartloads of manure and 181 cartloads of bedding soil were delivered to 41 military dependents' households. To solve the military dependents' difficulty in obtaining firewood, the masses in the 13th district of Wanping guaranteed to prepare coal for the military dependents by the end of April. With the help of village cadres and the masses, military dependents in various localities have high confidence in completing this year's production increase tasks. Generally, counties, in conjunction with relevant departments and agricultural production work, made substitute farming plans before spring (such as determining the amount of substitute farming military dependents should enjoy, and unified allocation and balanced distribution of labor), and carried out key demonstrations to create and absorb experience, and promptly introduced and promoted them. In the demonstration in Changxinying Village, Zhao County, it was found that village cadres and military dependents with more labor were unwilling to participate. After patient persuasion cleared their thinking, they gained confidence in implementing the contract farming system, and adopted a system of self-reporting and public discussion to appropriately determine substitute farming households. Tongxian Special District proposed setting the number of workdays by season to avoid uneven labor use, and also established a system of work recording, clearing, and rewards and punishments. At the same time, the cadres' thinking overcame, or is in the process of overcoming, phenomena such as "favoritism," "valuing the near and neglecting the distant," "inverting military and civilian priorities," or the bias of believing that disaster areas lack manpower and animal power, and abandoning or relaxing the production and substitute farming work of military dependents.

　　Generally, disaster areas organized military dependents and the masses to exchange labor and help each other, solving many difficulties in production. Wang Luotang's mutual aid team in Shizhuang Village, Anxin County, helped military dependents rush to plant 324 mu of barley and peas. Some counties also created substitute farming methods suitable for disaster areas. In Tasi Village, Qingyuan County (a general disaster village), when determining substitute farming households, households that can maintain their livelihoods and have labor will temporarily implement contract farming, and after the wheat harvest, they will work together. Households with contracted labor exceeding the number of workdays they should bear will be paid for their work in grain, and households with outstanding labor will use grain to offset the work. Cadres in severely affected villages in Ji County helped military dependents find households with capable labor to cultivate the land that should be substituted, and signed revenue sharing contracts (such as stipulating that military dependents receive 60% and contract farming households receive 40%). After the wheat harvest, the labor force that should bear the substitute farming will then proportionally distribute the contracted military dependents' harvest among the contracted households.

　　Disaster areas' production self-salvation work, through loans of relief grain, in-kind subsidies of grain, and exchanging coarse grain for fine grain, organized and assisted revolutionary martyrs and military dependents to develop a variety of sideline production, solving difficulties in life. The 7th district of Ninghe County also helped military dependents find jobs, and many revolutionary military dependents were settled, solving their livelihood problems. Jia Tan Village, Leting County, mobilized military dependents to boil saltpeter to exchange for grain. Zhang Wenqin, a military dependent in Dugezhuang, borrowed fine yarn and cotton, and she wove cloth while her younger sister spun thread, and she was able to weave a bolt of cloth a day, earning 14 jin of millet. In production self-salvation, many military dependents have overcome the idea of simply relying on government relief. Yang Baohua's (a soldier's) father in Balizhuang, Qing County, said, "As long as we work a little harder, there will be no problem with our lives."

　　However, there are still many shortcomings in some areas. Some counties did not implement downwards according to the specific situation, with a focus and a plan, but rather promoted the preliminary draft issued last year across the board. Some counties, although they made transmissions at the people's representative conferences at all levels, did not conduct reviews well in connection with the past, or only the civil affairs departments paid attention, and did not coordinate with other departments to do it. Although some counties have found some experience in key demonstrations, they also lacked timely introduction. All localities must conduct in-depth inspections and make effective corrections.

　　At present, spring plowing and spring sowing have already begun. In addition to conducting in-depth inspections and specific leadership in accordance with the province's substitute farming methods, and further strengthening and improving substitute farming, various localities, in disaster areas where both manpower and animal power are extremely lacking, must emphasize that military dependents and the masses are organized to overcome this difficulty. In particular, for the land of military dependents in orphaned, elderly, disabled, and sick households, it should be earnestly guaranteed that spring sowing is not delayed.

### 河北组织军属生产  四十八县代耕工作获成绩

　　河北组织军属生产
    四十八县代耕工作获成绩
    【本报讯】河北日报消息：为认真做好代耕和组织军属生产，邯郸、邢台、沧县、石家庄、保定、通县、唐山、天津等专区四十八个县，今春都通过各界人民代表会议，布置和具体讨论了军属生产和代耕工作。通县、唐山两专区在三月上旬，又召开民政会议作了检查。有些县提出争取军属土地的增产，要作到和农民一样，一般地区恢复战前水平；个别已达战前水平的地区，争取适当超过。重灾区（常年潺区除外）以组织军属生产，不误农时为原则。现在全省无论灾区和非灾区，一般的对这一工作都很重视，已获有不少成绩。
    各地在春耕准备中，积极帮助军属积肥、送粪。定县十三区二十个村，帮助六百七十六户无劳力的烈军工属拉垫圈土四万一千零二十三车。曲阳唐家垣、大小南美等四个村，给四十一户军属送粪二百零五车，拉垫圈土一百八十一车。为解决军属的烧柴困难，宛平十三区群众保证四月底，给军属把煤准备好。各地军属在村干和群众帮助下，对今年完成增产任务的信心很高。一般的县都协同有关部门，结合农业生产工作，春前就做好代耕计划（如确定军属应享受代耕数量，和劳力统筹统支，调度平衡等），并进行重点示范，创造和吸取经验，及时介绍推广。赵县在常信营村示范中，发现村干部和劳力多的军属都不愿出动，经耐心说服打通了思想，对实行包耕制有了信心。采取自报公议，适当确定代耕户。通县专区提出按季规定工数，以免用工不均，还树立了记工清工和奖惩等制度。同时在干部思想上克服了或正在克服着“人在人情在”、“重近轻远”、“军工倒置”的现象，或认为灾区人，畜力缺少，放弃或放松军属生产和代耕工作的偏向。
    一般灾区组织军属群众变工互助解决了生产上的不少困难。安新石庄村王洛堂的互助组，八个人和军属互助抢种大麦、豌豆三百二十四亩。有的县还创造了适于灾区的代耕办法。清苑塔寺（一般灾村）确定代耕户时，让能维持生活又有劳力的户暂实行包耕，麦收后再齐工。齐工时包工户超过应负担工数的，按工兑粮，欠工的户用粮抵工。蓟县重灾村干部帮助军属把应代耕的地，找有力代耕的户耕种，并订立分收合同（如规定军属分六成，包耕户分四成），到麦收后，再由应负代耕的劳力，按实产平均摊出包耕户所分得军属的收成。
    灾区的生产自救工作通过贷赈粮、实物补助粮、以粗换细粮等，组织和扶助烈军工属展开了多种副业生产，解决了生活上的困难。宁河七区还帮助军属介绍职业，不少烈军属得到安置，解决了生活问题。乐亭县贾摊村发动军属熬硝换粮食。杜各庄军属张文琴贷了细纱、棉花，她织布妹妹纺线，一天能织一个布，挣十四斤小米。不少军属在生产自救中，克服了单纯依赖政府救济的思想。清县八里庄杨宝华（军人）的父亲说：“只要受点累，生活不成问题。”
    但有些地区，还存在不少缺点。有的县没有按具体情况，有重点有计划的向下贯彻，而是根据去年所发的初步草案，全盘推下去。有的县虽在各界人民代表会上作了传达，也没有很好联系过去进行检讨，或只民政部门重视了，也没配合其他部门去搞。有的县，虽然在重点示范中找出些经验，但也缺乏及时介绍出去。各地必须深入检查，并做有效的纠正。
    目前春耕春种已经开始，各地除根据省府代耕办法，深入检查具体领导，进一步加强与改进代耕外，在灾区因人畜劳力均极缺乏，必须强调军属群众组织起来，以克服这一困难。特别是对孤老残病户军属土地，应切实保证不误春种。
