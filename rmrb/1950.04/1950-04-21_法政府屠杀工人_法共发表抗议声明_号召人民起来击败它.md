　　Xinhua News Agency, Twentieth Dispatch: TASS, Paris, Eighteenth Dispatch: Parisian newspapers report that on April 17th, when the French working people held a demonstration in Brest, they were attacked by the police. During this attack, the police openly killed a 24-year-old worker named Mazé. In addition, dozens of other demonstrators were injured. After the police continuously fired on the demonstrating masses, they arrested many people, including Communist member of the National Assembly, Siour.

　　On the 18th, workers in Brest, responding to the call of all the trade unions in Brest, launched a 24-hour general strike to protest the police's bloody attack on the demonstrators.

　　The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party also issued a protest statement, stating: The French Communist Party angrily protests the despicable shooting incident that occurred in Brest on government orders. The French government is stepping up police brutality in preparation for the anti-Soviet war that the United States wants to impose on all countries.

　　The French Communist Party calls on all French people who love freedom and peace to unite and fight to defeat this government that shoots French workers.

    法共发表抗议声明
    号召人民起来击败它
    【新华社廿日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：巴黎报纸报道：四月十七日，法国劳动人民在布勒斯特举行示威时，遭到警察的攻击。在这次攻击中，警察公然打死了二十四岁的工人马兹。另外还有数十名示威者受伤。警察在连续射击了示威群众以后，又逮捕了许多人。其中有国民议会共产党议员西约尔。
    十八日，布勒斯特工人响应布勒斯特所有工会的号召，发动了二十四小时的总罢工，抗议警察对示威者的血腥攻击。
    法共中央委员会书记处亦为此发表抗议声明称：法国共产党愤怒地抗议奉政府命令在布勒斯特发生的卑鄙枪击事件。法国政府正加紧警察暴行，以准备美国所想要强加于各国的反苏战争。
    法国共产党号召所有爱自由、爱和平的法国人团结起来进行斗争，以击败这一枪击法国工人的政府。
