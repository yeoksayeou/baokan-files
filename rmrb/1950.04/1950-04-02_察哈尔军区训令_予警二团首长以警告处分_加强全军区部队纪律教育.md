　　Chahar Military Region Order
    Warning Punishment for Leaders of the 2nd Guard Regiment
    Strengthening Disciplinary Education for All Troops in the Military Region
    Regarding this incident, the Chahar Military Region has also issued an order, punishing the relevant cadres of the regiment. The order stated: The reason why the problem is so serious is because this destructive behavior occurred after the Central Government repeatedly instructed to protect state property, and after the Provincial Government clearly announced Ci'er Mountain as a restricted mountain; it is because this destructive behavior occurred in the Military Region's guard unit. The duty of the guard unit is to protect state property and protect the construction of Zhangjiakou City. This destructive behavior completely violates its glorious guard mission.
    The order continued: "In order to compensate for the losses caused by the destruction, and to seriously enforce discipline and educate the troops, in addition to ordering the 2nd Guard Regiment to plant 20,000 trees on Ci'er Mountain this year, the leaders of the regiment are given a warning, and the commander of the 2nd Battalion Machine Gun Company, Kong Xianming, is given an administrative demotion and a public warning within the Party. At the same time, the Military Region discovered it too late and has submitted a request to the North China Military Region for criticism and punishment."

　　察哈尔军区训令
    予警二团首长以警告处分         
    加强全军区部队纪律教育
    察哈尔军区对此事件，亦发出训令，处分该团有关干部。该训令内称：问题之所以严重，是因为这一破坏行为，竟发生于中央一再指示保护国家财产，与省府明令宣布赐儿山为禁山之后；是因为这一破坏行为，竟发生于军区警卫部队。警卫部队之职责乃是保护国家财产，保护张市建设，这种破坏行为完全违反其所担负的光荣警卫任务。
    训令继称：“为了补偿破坏所造成的损失，和严肃纪律、教育部队起见，除令警二团今年在赐儿山植树两万株外，并给该团首长以警告处分，给该团二营机炮连长孔宪明以行政上撤职，党内当众警告处分。同时，军区发现太迟，已呈请华北军区批评与处分。”
