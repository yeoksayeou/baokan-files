[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to prevent disputes between various government agencies engaged in production and suburban farmers, after consultation with relevant departments, has recently stipulated the following measures for government agencies occupying suburban land:

　　(1) All government agencies occupying land in the suburbs must be approved by the Municipal Government. The local district government will requisition, purchase, or lease the land from the farmers. Government agencies must not directly negotiate with the farmers regarding the land.

　　(2) If government agencies use farmers' land for vegetable cultivation, they must obtain the farmers' consent and may not forcibly requisition it.

　　(3) All vegetables grown by government agencies should be limited to their own use and not sold in the market, so as not to affect the income of suburban vegetable farmers.
