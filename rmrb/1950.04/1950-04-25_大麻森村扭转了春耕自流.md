　　Damasen Village Reverses the Drift in Spring Ploughing
    Zhao Huilin
    Damasen Village, Sixth District, Hengshui, Hebei Province, has a total of 260 households with 1,073 people. There are 16 Communist Party members in the village. The work of the branch is relatively weak, and a strong leadership core has not been formed. However, the relationship between village cadres and the masses is quite good, and general tasks can be completed on schedule. In the whole county, it is a relatively representative general village.
    The original work arrangement was to focus on spring ploughing and sowing, combined with democratic political construction and production assessment and quota setting. However, due to unclear leadership thinking and the inability to resolve the contradictions between the three, the result was that production assessment was the main focus, village elections were secondary, and spring ploughing and sowing were left to drift. When the provincial work group arrived in the village in early April, the preliminary assessment of production had been completed. At this time, the district leaders still emphasized "Production assessment first." The village cadres were engaged in production assessment in their hands, but were thinking about spring ploughing in their hearts. The masses also had many concerns and misunderstandings about production assessment, and reflected that "We'll give however much the government wants, so it's better not to assess it anymore." As a result, production assessment added to the ideological obstacles to production among the masses. The village election was also not implemented in accordance with the policies. The branch only discussed a list of representatives themselves and reported it to the district. The masses did not even know who the representatives were. Spring ploughing was left to drift, resulting in the land generally only being harrowed once or twice. Some of the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, as well as the elderly, weak, orphans and widows, had not yet delivered manure to the fields. Based on these specific circumstances, the work group, after discussion and deliberation within the Party, convened an expanded cadre meeting on the evening of April 4th to summarize the work of production assessment and village elections. Then, in accordance with the instructions of the provincial government, the production assessment and village elections were temporarily postponed, and all efforts were put into spring ploughing and sowing. The village cadres all expressed their enthusiastic support. Village Chief Wang Zirong said: "The masses are asking for production, and we are also willing to lead production, and you are here for production too, this is a three-in-one. Then, let's turn around immediately, this meeting will be called the 'Turning Point Meeting.'" Finance and Grain Committee member Wang Zhenpu said: "These words have struck a chord in my heart, I can go three days without eating." The next day, the work group and the district youth committee held a youth forum and a village women's cadre meeting, calling on young people and women to participate in the spring ploughing and sowing campaign. All twelve citizen groups in the village also held meetings with individual households to carry out ideological mobilization among the masses.
    Establish a central organization to lead production on the original basis. At this time, the county farm, based on soil and working conditions, determined that Damasen was a promotion area for the excellent variety - "811" millet. However, some people were afraid that they "wouldn't know how to manage it, and the harvest would be small." It just so happened that a dozen people from Dujialou in Qinghe came to the village to open a "warm chicken coop." As soon as they arrived here, at the first meal, they said, "Your millet here is not as delicious as ours." Everyone asked them what kind of millet they planted. They said it was "811" millet. They also explained that this kind of millet was strong, resistant to wind and disease, and had a high yield (generally increasing production by 20%). The work group seized on this fact to publicize it to the masses, breaking down their concerns. The village cadres also took the lead in planting it, with Village Chief Wang Zirong first committing to seven mu. As a result, eight hundred jin of millet seeds were all loaned out in less than two days.
    Qingming had arrived, and the district government called on the masses to sow in a timely manner, and to combine it with weeding wheat and eliminating wasteland. The work group and comrades from the farm mobilized the masses to weed wheat and helped them soak seeds. Women also went to the fields to weed wheat, with Wang Xinyu and Wang Xinyue weeding three mu in one day. Lazy man Wang Shuangcheng still had two mu of wasteland, but after hearing the government's call to "not leave an inch of land barren," he quickly borrowed an ox, plowed and harrowed the land, and sowed millet. On the 7th, red spiders were found in some wheat fields, and the district government instructed "Sowing and pest control should not be neglected." The work group also introduced the method of "weeding wheat combined with pest control" from the newspaper. However, due to the lack of emphasis on ideological mobilization, the masses were negligent and only focused on weeding wheat. In less than three days, the pest infestation spread to the wheat fields throughout the village, and half of the wheat hearts became withered. The masses began to realize the seriousness of the pest infestation. At this time, millet and sorghum had been sown almost entirely. It was not yet time to sow "two-row millet" and cotton. The work group seized this gap and called for a concentrated effort to kill red spiders within five days. The branch secretary immediately proposed "Party members and cadres should take the lead in catching pests." The next day, all households in the village participated in pest control, setting off a wave of pest control. Wang Yuliang from West Street ate two meals more than usual in order to catch pests. He set a plan to weed six mu of wheat in two days and eliminate all the pests. He then challenged North Street based on this condition. In the evening, the propaganda team broadcast this news, and Wang Yuheng and Wang Laogong, the group leaders of the fifth and sixth groups of North Street, immediately responded, guaranteeing that all men, women, old and young in the group would go to the fields together. After three days of repeated beating, the pest infestation has stopped spreading, most of the red spiders have been eliminated, and the wheat seedlings have begun to turn from yellow to green.
    Now, the wheat in the village has generally been weeded once or twice (in the past there was no habit of weeding wheat), sorghum has been sown entirely, and most of the millet has also been sown. The task of planting cotton has been implemented to each household. Last year's profit from cotton planting has made the cotton farmers very enthusiastic. The cotton fields have all been fertilized and harrowed three to four times. The seeds have also been selected, and the supply and marketing cooperative has loaned out 2,600 jin of bean cake. Everything is ready, just waiting for sowing.

　　大麻森村扭转了春耕自流
    赵辉林
    河北衡水六区大麻森村，共有二百六十户，一千零七十三人。村中中共党员十六人。支部工作较薄弱，没有形成坚强的领导核心。不过，村干部群众关系还相当好，一般任务都还能够按期完成。在全县说来，是一个比较能够代表一般的村。
    工作原布置是以春耕播种为主，结合进行民主建政和评产定量。但由于领导思想不明确，和不善于解决三者之间的矛盾，结果却形成了评产为主，村选为辅，春耕播种陷于自流。省工作组于四月初到达该村时，评产工作已经完成了粗评。这时区领导上仍强调“评产第一”。村干部手里搞评产，心里想春耕。群众对评产也存有许多顾虑和误解，认为评产是为了“提高负担”，反映说：“政府要多少就给多少，干脆不要再评了。”结果，评产反而增添了群众生产的思想障碍。村选也没有认真地贯彻政策，只是支部自己讨论出一个代表名单，就报到区里了，群众连代表是谁也不知道，春耕自流，结果地一般才只耙一、两遍，一部分烈军工属和老弱孤寡的粪还没送到地里，工作组根据这些具体情况，经过在党内进行讨论酝酿，于四月四日晚上，召开扩大干部会，总结了评产、村选工作。然后依照省府指示，把评产和村选暂且推迟一步，全力投入春耕播种。村干部都首先表示热烈地拥护。村长王子荣说：“群众要求生产，我们也愿意领导生产，你们来也是为着生产，这是三合一。那么，咱们就马上转，这个会就叫转弯会。”财粮委员王振普说：“这话都说到我心窝里，三天不吃饭也行。”第二天，工作组又和区青委会召开青年座谈会，村妇女干部会，号召青年、妇女参加春耕播种运动。全村十二个公民小组，也分别召开片户会，向群众进行思想动员。
    在原有基础上，树立领导生产的中心组织。这时，县农场根据土壤和工作条件，确定大麻森为优良品种——“八一一”谷的推广区。但有些群众怕“不会收拾，收头小。”正好清河杜家楼有十几个人来这村开“暖鸡坊”。他们一到这里在吃第一顿饭时，就说：“你们这里小米，比不上我们那里好吃。”大家就问他们种的是什么谷子？他们说是“八一一”谷。又说明这种谷子结壮，能抗风、抗病，产量又多（一般可以增产百分之二十）。工作组就抓住这一事实，向群众进行宣传，打破了群众顾虑。村干部也带头种，村长王子荣就先认了七亩。结果，八百斤谷子种，不到两天就全部贷下去了。
    清明已到，区政府号召群众及时播种，并结合锄麦、消灭荒地。工作组和农场同志就发动群众锄麦，并帮助群众浸种。妇女也纷纷下地锄麦，王新玉、王新月姊妹两个，一天锄了三亩。懒汉王双成还有二亩荒地，听政府号召要“不荒一寸土”，就也赶紧借了头牛，把地耕耙了，耩上谷子。七日，有些麦地开始发现红蜘蛛，区政府指示“播种捕虫两不误”。工作组也介绍了报纸上“锄麦结合捕虫”的办法。但由于没有着重思想发动，群众麻痹大意，只顾锄麦。不到三天，虫灾蔓延到全村的麦地，有二分之一的麦心变成干枯。群众才开始认识到虫灾的严重性。这时，谷子和高粱都已播种的差不多。“二耧谷”和棉花还不到耩的时候，工作组抓住这个空隙，号召在五天内突击捕灭红蜘蛛。支部书记当即提出“党员干部要带头捕虫。”第二天，全村家家户户都参加了捕虫，掀起了捕虫浪潮。西街王玉良为了捕虫，改吃两吨饭。他自己订出计划，要在两天内把六亩麦子锄一遍，并把虫子全部消灭。并根据这个条件向北街挑战。晚上，宣传组把这消息一广播，北街五、六组组长王玉铮和王老贡马上应战，保证全组男女老少一齐下地。经过三天来的反复捕打，虫灾已经停止发展，红蜘蛛消灭大部，麦苗也开始由黄变青了。
    现在，全村麦子已普遍锄一遍到两遍（过去没有锄麦习惯），高粱已全部耩上，谷子也耩了大部分，植棉任务已经贯彻到户。去年植棉获利，棉农情绪很高，留棉地已全部送上粪，耙了三至四遍，种籽也已经选好，供销社又贷给二千六百斤豆饼。一切准备停当，只等播种。
