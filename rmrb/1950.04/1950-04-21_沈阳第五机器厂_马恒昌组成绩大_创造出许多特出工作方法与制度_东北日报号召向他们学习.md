(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) Northeast Daily published news of the outstanding production achievements of the Ma Hengchang Production Group of Shenyang No. 5 Machine Factory on the front page headline on the 14th, and published a special article and editorial introducing the group's production experience, calling on factories to study and learn from their advanced production experience. From April last year to February this year, the Ma Hengchang Group completed its production plan ahead of schedule every month. In the seven months from May to November last year, it produced more than 7,000 precision products. Among the original ten workers, eight did not produce a single defective product throughout the year; seven created ten new production records. The group reformed 18 kinds of tools and improved working methods three times; it performed meritorious service 16 times in the new record creation movement, and successively won three award flags from the factory, the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Industry Department. All of the original ten workers have successively joined the Communist Party of China and have been promoted to administrative, Communist Party, and trade union cadres within the factory.

The Ma Hengchang Group created some outstanding working methods and systems, which is a major reason why they became a model production group. They attach great importance to the research and mutual assistance of technology. They established two organizations: the "Technology Research Association" and the "Three-Person Technology Mutual Assistance Group." The former uses the lunch break to study the production plans and blueprints assigned to the group, studying their key points and the places that are most easily overlooked and paying attention to improving them. The latter is to ensure that no defective work is produced and to solve temporary problems in doing work. They hold a production review meeting once a week to study the causes of product scrapping and how to overcome them. The result of such mutual help and supervision not only broke the technical conservatism and the narrow arrogance of workers who are unwilling to let others see themselves doing work, but also improved the technical level and strengthened mutual unity. Ma Hongru, a worker in the group, originally took two hours to make a spiral washing bearing. Later, after everyone's research, the operation method was improved, and one can be made in 15 minutes. In addition to studying technology, they pay more attention to the inspection of work. They implemented the system of "inspecting the first product first," overcoming the waste phenomenon of post-inspection, which means that if one is scrapped, a large number will be scrapped, and thereby promoted the work of the inspection section and the technical mutual assistance group.

Due to technical unity and mutual assistance and careful inspection, the Ma Hengchang Group strictly implemented the production responsibility system. In June last year, they formulated five labor disciplines, the main contents of which are to ensure that they are not late or leave early, to prepare everything in advance, and to start the machine when the bell rings. When doing work, they often pay attention to protecting the machine to avoid problems; after get off work, they wipe the motor lathe clean, lubricate it well, and tidy up the tools; in addition to the group leader and the elected machine maintenance cadre checking, they must also check each other. After the group started the two-shift system in January this year, the day shift handover person, after explaining the work situation clearly, must also watch the reliever do the work once before leaving. When the night shift gets off work, the handover person writes the precautions on a piece of paper and puts it on the machine; when there is something particularly important, the handover person must also come and take a look the next day. New workers or apprentices also make rapid progress in the Ma Hengchang Group. On the second day that worker Wang Zhanxue came to the group, with the help of the old workers, he created a new record for leveling the lead screw. The group has always brought more apprentices. The six apprentices who have completed their training can all go to the machine and work independently after studying for three months. The method of the Ma Hengchang Group in taking apprentices is to teach while doing. At the beginning, they ask the apprentices to watch the work and ask as much as possible; after they are a little familiar, they must ask them to go to the machine to do the work, and the master carefully teaches and watches them, so the apprentices quickly learn their skills.

The Northeast Daily editorial on the Ma Hengchang Group emphasized that there are currently serious phenomena of poor product quality and no one being responsible in industrial production. On the other hand, with the recovery and development of the entire Northeast industry, a large number of new workers and apprentices have poured into the people's factories and mines; how to lead them and make them become skilled workers quickly has become an urgent task on the industrial production front. The Ma Hengchang Group has created relatively mature and extremely valuable experience precisely in solving these serious and urgent tasks. The editorial called on all industrial production units to mobilize workers to study and learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group and apply it to their own production activities, so that Ma Hengchang-style groups will continue to emerge in large numbers in all production departments in order to rapidly promote production.

　　沈阳第五机器厂
    马恒昌组成绩大
    创造出许多特出工作方法与制度
    东北日报号召向他们学习
    【新华社十九日讯】东北日报十四日以一版头条地位刊载了沈阳第五机器厂马恒昌生产小组优异的生产成绩的消息，并发表了介绍该小组生产经验的专文和社论，号召各工厂研究学习他们的先进生产经验。马恒昌小组从去年四月到今年二月，每月都提前完成生产计划。去年五月到十一月的七个月中，共做出精密产品七千余件。在原有十名工人中，有八名全年没有出过一件废品；有七名创造了十次生产新纪录。全组共改造了工具十八种，改进工作方法三次；在创造新纪录运动中共立功十六次，先后荣获该厂、沈阳市总工会及东北工业部的三面奖旗。原有十名工人已先后参加了中国共产党，并被提升为厂内行政、共产党与工会的干部。
    马恒昌小组创造了一些特出的工作方法和制度，这是使他们成为模范生产小组的一个主要原因。他们很注重对技术的研究与互助。他们建立了“技术研究会”和“三人技术互助小组”两种组织，前者是利用中午休息时间研究分配到该组的生产计划和图纸，研究它的要点和最容易被人马虎的地方而加以注意改进；后者是为了保证不出废活，和解决做活中临时发生的问题。每周他们进行一次生产检讨会，研究产品报废原因及克服办法。这样互相帮助、监督的结果，不但打破了工人中的技术保守思想和不愿别人看自己做活的狭隘自负心理，提高了技术水平，并且加强了相互间的团结。该组工人马洪儒本来做一个螺旋洗轴承要二小时，后来经过大家研究，改进了操作法，十五分钟就可做一个。除了研究技术，他们更注意对工作的检查，他们实行了“先检查头一个产品”的制度，克服了事后检查、一废就是一大批的浪费现象，并因此推动了检查股和技术互助小组的工作。
    由于技术上团结互助，认真检查，马恒昌小组严格执行了生产负责制。他们在去年六月就订出了五条劳动纪律，主要内容是保证不迟到早退，一切事先准备好，铃响就开车。做活时他们经常注意保护机器，避免出毛病；在下班后都把马达车床擦干净，上好油，把工具整理好；除组长和选出的爱护机器干事检查外，还须互相检查一遍。该组在今年一月开始两班制以后，日班交班者在把工作情况交代清楚后，还要看接班者做一回活才走。夜班下班时，交班者就把注意事项写在纸条上放在机器上；遇有特别重要事情时，交班者第二天还要来看一下。新工人或学徒在马恒昌小组内进步也很快。工人王占学到该组的第二天，由于老工人们的帮助，就创造了挑平铣丝杠的新纪录。该组带徒工一向较多，已经满师的六个徒工，都是学了三个月就能上机架独立干活。马恒昌组带徒弟的方法是边做边教，开始叫徒弟看着做活，尽量问；稍熟悉后，就要他们上机器做活，师傅认真在旁教着，看着，因此，徒弟们很快就学会了本事。
    东北日报关于马恒昌小组发表的社论强调指出：目前工业生产中存在着严重的产品质量低劣与无人负责的现象。另一方面，随着整个东北工业的恢复与发展，新的工人与学徒大量地涌进了人民的工厂矿山；如何带领他们，使之很快地成为熟练的工人，已成为工业生产战线上的迫切任务。马恒昌小组恰正在解决当前这些严重而迫切的任务方面，创造了比较成熟与极为珍贵的经验。社论号召各工业生产单位发动工人，研究与学习马恒昌小组的经验，并运用到自己的生产活动中去，使一切生产部门中不断地大量地涌现马恒昌式的小组，以便迅速地推进生产。
