　　Electric News Agency Commentary on the Sino-Soviet Agreement
    Xinjiang Province’s Mineral and Petroleum Development Will Lead to Rapid Expansion of Chinese Industry
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st] Electric News Agency, Moscow, 29th: The establishment of two joint-stock companies by the Soviet Union and China to develop and exploit mineral and petroleum resources in Xinjiang is an unpleasant surprise for those Western diplomatic officials here. Despite Vyshinsky's response that shattered all rumors, these people stubbornly maintain Acheson's absurd view that China has lost jurisdiction over its northern and western provinces.
    The agreement signed on the 27th explicitly recognizes China's sovereignty in Xinjiang and unfolds the prospect that Chinese industry can be greatly expanded with the development of raw materials in this largest province.
    There is no doubt here that the speed of this expansion will be closer to the speed at which the Soviet Union develops its own industry, rather than the speed of the colonial "backward areas," where the capitalist countries' need for exploitation is always higher than industrialization.

　　电通社评中苏协定
    新疆省矿产石油的开发将使中国工业迅速扩展
    【新华社三十一日讯】电通社莫斯科二十九日电：苏联和中国为发展和开发新疆矿产和石油资源起见，创办两个联合的股份公司。这件事的宣布，对于此间那些西方外交官员是一个不愉快的意外事件，尽管维辛斯基已作了粉碎一切谰言的答复，这些人却仍顽固保持着艾奇逊的荒谬观点，说中国已经丧失了北部和西部诸省管辖权。
    二十七日签订的协定明确地承认中国在新疆的主权，而且展开了这样的前途，即中国工业能够随着这一最大省份的原料的开发而得到广大的扩展。
    此间毫不怀疑，这种扩展的速度将比较接近于苏联发展其本身工业的速度，而不是接近于殖民地“落后地区”的速度，在殖民地“落后地区”，资本主义国家的剥削需要总是高于工业化的。
