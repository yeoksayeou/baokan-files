Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Truth Daily reporters Rasadin and Filipov reported on the events taking place in the United Nations in the Truth Daily on the 4th. The two reporters wrote that the United Nations has been in a state of paralysis and neglect for three months. This is a direct result of the policy pursued by the Anglo-American bloc.

With the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, the American ruling circles stubbornly oppose the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations. They would rather deal with the agents of the Chiang Kai-shek criminal clique than with the representatives of the Chinese people.

We know that five of the eleven member states of the Security Council have already established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China or have decided to establish diplomatic relations, and the governments of several other countries participating in this most important UN organization, in view of the reality of historical development, are willing to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But some of them had not even uttered this intention when they were rudely rebuffed by their State Department masters. According to reporters' observations, from these facts, the hypocrisy and sanctimony of the US representative to the United Nations, Gross, is even more obvious. Gross claimed that the United States does not force other governments to accept its opinions. He also said: Regarding the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the United States is prepared to accept the decisions made by the majority of countries. This is a very clumsy trick. The American ruling circles are deliberately obstructing the resolution of the China issue, and are happy to keep the United Nations in a state of disintegration and paralysis, in order to help the war profiteers carry out their dark schemes. The Truth Daily reporter emphasized that the behavior of the British representative in the United Nations vividly illustrates the Labor government's double-dealing tactics. Recently, the British representative voted against the proposal to expel Kuomintang agents in seven United Nations organizations, and abstained in another seven organizations.

Anglo-American Bloc's Aggressive Policy Paralyzes UN Institutions

The Truth Daily reporter continued: The Anglo-American bloc has paralyzed the United Nations. But in order to evade responsibility for undermining international cooperation, the American representatives are trying to shift this blame onto others. Mr. Acheson shouted himself hoarse about the Soviet Union's "policy of obstruction." But the facts clearly point out who is burying the United Nations.

When US representative Gross spoke at the University of Virginia on March 17, he said: The Security Council should end its work because the Soviet Union has veto power in the Security Council, and that the United Nations should turn its attention to the work of the UN's secondary institutions. These words of his are not accidental. It is not difficult to understand that the purpose of Gross's policy is to prevent the United Nations from resolving the most important issues of maintaining peace and security.

In order to deceive public opinion, American diplomats fabricate various tricks and come up with many ridiculous reasons, insisting that this is the reason that hinders the resolution of the issue of replacing the Kuomintang agents in the United Nations with the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people. But all these statements are full of loopholes.

The Truth Daily reporters continued: The experience of the past three months shows that without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the United Nations institutions cannot play their original role at all. It has gradually become a mere appendage of the US State Department.

The recently held 10th session of the Economic and Social Council without the participation of the Soviet Union proves that there was no discussion or criticism at the meeting at all. The representatives of the American vassal states obeyed their masters and basely raised their hands in favor of all the decisions that the Wall Street overlords wanted.

The Soviet Union sees the United Nations as an institution for the people of all countries to achieve peace and security. Obviously, the American ruling circles have a different task for the United Nations. They are afraid of cooperating with peace-loving and democratic countries. The Truth Daily reporter finally said: This policy exposes the aggressive aims of the Anglo-American bloc. This policy is inevitably doomed to a miserable defeat.

　　真理报记者报道
    美国在埋葬联合国
    无理阻挠中国参加联合国，目的在便于进行贩卖战争的黑暗勾当。
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻纽约记者拉萨丁与费利波夫，四日在真理报上报道在联合国中所发生的事件。两记者写道，联合国处在瘫痪和被忽视状态下已有三个月。这是英美集团所奉行的政策的直接结果。
    美国统治集团在北大西洋公约缔约国的支持之下，顽固地反对中华人民共和国在联合国中获得其合法的地位。他们宁愿和蒋介石罪恶集团的代理人们打交道，而不愿和中国人民的代表们来往。
    我们知道，安理会十一个会员国中已有五个业已与中华人民共和国建立外交关系或决定建立外交关系，而参加这个联合国最重要机构的若干其他国家的政府，鉴于历史发展的现实，已愿意与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。但是它们中有些还没有把这种意图说出口，就立即被他们的国务院主子们所粗暴地喝退。据记者观察，从这些事实看来，美国驻联合国的代表葛罗斯声明的虚伪及假仁假义，就更加显明。葛罗斯宣称，美国并不强制其他政府接受它的意见。又说：关于中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权问题，美国准备接受大多数国家所作的决定。这是很拙劣的诡计。美国的统治集团正故意地阻挠中国问题的解决，并乐于使联合国保持解体和瘫痪的状态，借以帮助战争贩子们进来进行他们黑暗的勾当。真理报记者强调指出，英国代表在联合国中的行为生动地说明了工党政府的两面手法。近来英国代表在七个联合国机构里投票反对开除国民党代理人的建议，并在另外七个机构中弃权。
    英美集团侵略政策瘫痪了联合国机构
    真理报记者接着写道：英美集团瘫痪了联合国。但是为了逃避破坏国际合作的责任，美国的代表们企图将这种过错推到别人头上。艾奇逊先生嘶破喉咙大叫苏联的“阻挠政策”。但事实却清清楚楚地指明了究竟是谁在埋葬联合国。
    美代表葛罗斯三月十七日在弗吉尼亚大学讲演时说：安理会应当结束它的工作，因为苏联在安理会有否决权，又说联合国应当将它的注意力转到联合国次要机构的工作上。他这些话并不是偶然的。不难了解，葛罗斯所持的方针，其目的是在于使联合国不要去解决最重要的维持和平与安全的问题。
    为了欺骗舆论，美国外交人员捏造各种诡计，想出许多可笑的理由，硬说这是妨碍解决以中国人民的合法代表代替联合国中的国民党代理人的问题的原因。但所有这些说法都是破绽百出。
    真理报记者们接着说：过去三个月的经验表明，联合国机构如果没有苏联和人民民主国家的参加，它原定的作用就一点也起不了。它渐渐成了美国国务院单纯的附属物。
    最近举行的没有苏联参加的第十届经社理事会，证明会上丝毫谈不上有任何讨论和批评。美国附庸国家的代表对他们的主子唯命是从，卑贱地举手赞成华尔街太上皇所想要的一切决定。
    苏联把联合国看作是各国人民取得和平及安全的机构。显然，美国统治集团给联合国的任务却是另外一种。他们害怕和爱好和平民主的国家合作。真理报记者最后说：这种政策暴露了英美集团的侵略目的。这种政策无可避免地是注定要惨败的。
