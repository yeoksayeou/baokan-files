　　U.S. Imperialism Strengthens Domestic Reign of Terror
    Fear Has Engulfed the Entire Country
    Professor Mathiessen, Unable to Bear Oppression, Commits Suicide by Jumping from a Building
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 4th] U.S. imperialism is strengthening its anti-communist, anti-democratic reign of terror domestically. According to a United Press report, former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes admitted in a speech at Roosevelt College in Chicago on March 29th: "There is a sense of fear everywhere in Washington. You can be summoned by a congressional committee (referring to the House Un-American Activities Committee) at any time and asked why you happened to brush shoulders with a communist on the street." This kind of terror rule in the United States has extended to institutions of higher education. Wayne University in Detroit has banned communists from participating in school activities and launched a "tense campaign against progressive left-wing groups" on campus. United Press pointed out: "This may set a precedent for other schools." Furthermore, according to a United Press report from Boston, Harvard University's famous professor, Mathiessen, unable to bear the pain of persecution by the authorities, committed suicide by jumping from a hotel in Boston on the 1st.

　　美帝加强国内恐怖统治
    恐惧的感觉已笼罩了全国各地
    教授马撒逊不堪压迫跳楼自杀
    【新华社四日讯】美帝国主义正在国内加强反共反民主的恐怖统治。据合众社消息，美前内长伊克斯三月二十九日在芝加哥罗斯福学院发表谈话时承认：“华盛顿到处都有恐惧的感觉，你随时都县被国会委员会（按指众院非美活动委员会）召去，问你为何在街上碰巧与一个共产党人擦身而过”的问题。美国这种恐怖统治已扩及高等文化教育机关。底特律市立韦尼大学已禁止共产党人参加学校活动，并在校内发动“反对进步左翼团体的紧张运动”，合众社指出：“这可能为其他学校建立一个先例”。另据合众社波斯顿讯，哈佛大学著名教授马撒逊，不堪当局迫害之苦，已于一日在波斯顿旅馆跳楼自杀。
