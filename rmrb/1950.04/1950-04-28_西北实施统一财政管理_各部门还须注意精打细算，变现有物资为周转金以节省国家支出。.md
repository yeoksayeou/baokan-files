　　Northwest Implements Unified Financial Management; Departments Must Also Pay Attention to Careful Budgeting, Converting Existing Materials into Working Capital to Save National Expenditure.
    [Our Correspondent in Xi'an] The specific implementation measures for unified management of financial revenue and expenditure formulated by the Northwest Administrative Region have begun to be implemented. In the past, when various departments spent operating expenses and bank loans, it was common to simply discuss it verbally or submit a very simple document explaining what project was to be built, and funds could be drawn. Now, budgeting has generally begun. Some departments have prepared detailed usage plans, enabling approving authorities to conduct scientific reviews and check the implementation and results according to the plan. This is a powerful impetus and guarantee for the accurate completion of various undertakings. However, generally speaking, due to the lack of in-depth investigation and careful budgeting by various departments in their own undertakings, the implementation is still not good. Either there is a budget but no usage plan, or the plan, though present, is very general and crude, not precise. For example, in the Livestock Department's 1950 Northwest Livestock Loan Allocation Plan, the uses of various loans are only written in simple sentences. For example, under the item "Livestock Veterinary Equipment and Medicine Loan," the usage column reads "Purchase equipment and medicine." Under the item "Breeding Stock Loan," the usage column reads "Purchase breeding stock." No other explanation can be found. The use of the "Production Livestock Loan" is written more specifically: "Mainly sheep, other livestock as secondary." But it is not known what proportion of the loan is for sheep, what is planned to be lent to sheep farmers; what "other" refers to, what proportion each occupies, and what they will be used for. In addition, various loans such as "Feed," "Livestock Products," and "Private Ranch" are all very general, making it difficult for the approving authorities to conduct specific reviews. The water conservancy and transportation departments are to build a number of canals, drainage, bridges, and culvert projects. Except for the detailed and precise engineering plan for the Dinghui Canal in northern Shaanxi, there is still no precise plan for other projects. Moreover, the calculated prices often far exceed actual needs, and the budgets of some departments are as broad as possible, demonstrating a failure to deeply accept the spirit of "more revenue, less expenditure," "careful budgeting," and "making one yuan do the work of two," and a lack of understanding that if the budget is too imprecise, it loses its meaning and amounts to a large amount of frozen funds, which will cause losses to the state. In forestry, the annual operating expense budget for this year was 13 million jin, which was reduced by 3 million jin. Some agencies, because their budgets were too imprecise and received some criticism, wanted to simply stop work. They are not good at thinking of their own solutions, nor are they actively trying to find ways to make the approved money and their own department's existing materials play a greater role. For example, a lot of sleepers are cut down. As long as they take care of their business and sell them, it will be a lot of money, and they can do many important things. But they don't calculate these things much, just ask the higher authorities for money. The water volume of the Shaanxi Meihui Canal can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land. Because of poor management, it is inconvenient for farmers to use water and they are unwilling to buy it, so only more than 10,000 mu are actually irrigated per year. The income is small, and they are not actively collecting fees, but only reaching out to the higher authorities for money. A textile enterprise unit has an inventory of finished products and raw materials worth more than 2.4 million real units after deducting outstanding debts, which is enough for working capital. But instead of trying to open up sales channels to sell goods, they are asking the higher authorities for working capital. And this includes one month's tax, three months' depreciation, and total profit that the state wants from them. This is the main obstacle in the implementation of the new system, and the Northwest Financial Committee is now seriously correcting it.

　　西北实施统一财政管理
    各部门还须注意精打细算，变现有物资为周转金以节省国家支出。
    【本报西安讯】西北行政区所制定的统一管理财政收支的具体执行办法，已开始付诸实施。过去各部门支用事业费与银行贷款时，常有口头谈一下或递一极简单呈文说明要修建什么工程就可支取的情形；现在则普遍开始做预算。有的部门已详细编造使用计划，使批准机关有可能进行科学的审核与按计划检查执行情形与结果。这对各项事业的准确完成是一个有力的推动与保证。但一般说来，由于各部门在自己担负的事业上缺乏深入的调查与精打细算，现在还执行得不好。或是有预算而没有使用计划，或是虽有计划而十分笼统了草，不精确。例如：畜牧部的一九五○年西北畜牧贷款分配计划中，各项贷款的用途都只写了简单一句话。如“畜牧兽医器材药械贷款”项下，用途栏写着“购买器材药械”。“种畜贷款”项下，用途栏写着“购买种畜”。此外再找不到任何其他说明。“生产家畜贷款”的用途写得比较具体：“羊为主，其他家畜为副”。但也不知羊占该项贷款数中多大比重，打算贷给养羊者做些什么；“其他”是指什么，各占多大比重，做些什么。此外，“饲料”、“畜产品”、“民营牧场”等各项贷款，都很笼统，使批准机关很难具体审核。水利、交通部门要修建若干渠道、排水、桥梁、涵洞工程，除陕北定惠渠的工程计划做得细密精确外，其他工程至今尚无一个精确的计划。而且计算价格亦多远远超过实际需要，及某些部门的预算尽量求宽，表现了尚未能深刻接受“多收少支”、“精打细算”、“一个钱当两个钱用”的精神，以及不了解：如果预算做得太不精确，就失去了预算的意义，等于大量冻结资金，国家会因此受到损失。林业方面，今年全年事业费预算一千三百万斤，即被核减了三百万斤。有的机关因为预算得过分不精确，受了点批评，就想索性停工不干。他们不善于自己想办法、也不积极想办法使批准的钱和自己部门现有的资材发挥更大的作用。比如说伐下许多道板（枕木），只要自己好好兜揽生意，推销出去就是一大笔钱，能做许多要紧事；但都不多去计算这些，只是向上面要钱。陕西梅惠渠水量能浇地十几万亩，因管理得不好，农民用水不便，不肯买用，一年只实浇一万多亩。收入既小，也不积极收费，光伸手向上面要钱。有一个纺织企业单位，积存成品和原料的价值，除了外欠还余二百四十余万折实单位，足够周转。但不设法开辟销路去售货，却向上面要周转金。且其中包括了国家要向他们要的一个月的税收、三个月的折旧费与利润总额。这是目前新制度实施中的主要障碍，西北财委现正认真进行纠正。
