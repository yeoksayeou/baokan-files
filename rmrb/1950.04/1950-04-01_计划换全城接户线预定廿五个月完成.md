Under the unified leadership and promotion of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, and influenced by the continuous creation of new records by the employees of the accounting section, employees in other departments of the bureau have also begun to take action. For example, when the outside line workers were pulling lines in the Nan Yuan district this time, according to past efficiency, each team of thirty people could erect a maximum of twenty poles per day. Now, with the number of people per team reduced by a quarter, an average of twenty-five poles can be erected per day. It was originally estimated that the entire project would require more than two thousand workdays, but now the workers have proposed that it can be completed in more than twelve hundred workdays. In the past, electric poles were usually transported by car, and more than two hundred people had to carry them to the ground. This time, the workers decided to hire large carts to pull them. Compared to the previous method, this can save more than ten thousand catties of millet. In addition, the workers salvaged more than one hundred usable crossarms (the horizontal beams on electric poles) from the scrap pile. The original plan to replace all the city's household connection lines, according to calculations by administrative and technical personnel, would take three to four years to complete. After mobilizing the workers for discussion, it has been shortened to twenty-five months. Workers in the Engineering Section seized the time to merge two lines in the Nan Yuan district and add a broken line at Xi Bian Men in a short period, which can reduce electricity losses by more than 300,000 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to about three percent of the city bureau's total power generation. The accounting section has been more meticulous in the calculation of various accounts and costs than before. Now, each item of account is converted from the amount into millet. The workload has increased, but due to the improvement of efficiency, the number of personnel has been reduced from seventeen to fifteen. Other departments have also reduced the waste of manpower and materials due to the improvement of work efficiency. The total number of personnel in the bureau has been reduced from 1,026 to 926 (these personnel have been transferred to other jobs or participated in study). The wage expenditure alone can be reduced by about 4,000 catties of millet. In addition, more than twenty people were drawn from the internal miscellaneous workers to participate in direct production of outside lines. However, at present, the rational use and development of human resources and the implementation of staffing work in the bureau are only preliminary. In some departments, there is still obvious waste of manpower and materials. For example, the various departments of the bureau use more than fifty odd-job men, and the use of these human resources should be more reasonable. In addition, the personnel structure and various official document procedures should be further simplified.

　　计划换全城接户线预定廿五个月完成
    由于核算股职工不断创造新纪录的影响，在党、政、工、团的统一领导和推动下，局内其他部门的职工也开始行动起来。如外线工人此次在南苑区拉线，根据过去效率，每班三十人每天最高立二十根杆子。现在每班人数减少四分之一，平均每天可立二十五根。原预计全工程需二千多工，现在工人提出一千二百多工即可完成。运电杆子过去照例是用汽车，另外还得用二百多人工抬到地里。这次工人决定雇大车拉。两者相比可少用一万多斤小米。另外，工人从废料堆检出了一百多根可用的横担（电杆上的横木）。原计划换全城接户线的工作，根据行政、技术人员的计算，须三年到四年完成。经发动工人讨论后，已缩短为二十五个月。工务科工人曾在短时间内抓紧合并南苑区的两条线路和加添西便门的一断线，可以减少电力损失三十余万度，约等于市局全部发电量的百分之三。会计科对各种账目和成本的计算已较前细致，现在每项账目要由金额折合小米，工作增多了，但由于效率提高，人员却由十七人减为十五人。其他各部门均由于工作效率的提高，减少了人力、物力的浪费现象。现全局人员已由一千零二十六人减少至九百二十六名（此部人员已分别调转工作或参加学习），仅工资开支一项即可减少约四千斤小米。另外并从内部杂工中抽出二十余人参加外线直接生产。但目前该局对人力的合理使用与发挥、定员工作的进行，还只是初步的。在有些部门仍然明显地存在着人力、物力的浪费现象。如该局各部门所用杂役达五十余人，对这些人力的使用上应更加合理。另外在人事机构与各种公文来往手续亦应更求简便。
