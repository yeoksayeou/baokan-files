　　Beijing Municipal Transport Workers' Union Organizes Workers
    Thoroughly Eliminate the Feudal "Lobby Boss" System
    Prepare to Establish a Transport Company to Unify Labor Allocation
    [Our Newspaper] (Reporter Lin Mo) reported: The Beijing Municipal Transport Workers' Union is now mobilizing transport workers throughout the city to eliminate the feudal "lobby boss" system in order to cooperate with the government in establishing a transport company. "Lobby bosses," who rule the workers, often deprive them of 50% to 80% of their income and inflict various forms of physical persecution. Workers are eager to be liberated from this dark system.
    The Beijing Municipal Transport Workers' Union began this work in January of this year after the first National Transport Workers' Union Congress. At that time, it concentrated its cadre strength, focusing first on Qianmen Railway Station, where there were more transport workers. It trained activists among the transport workers and mobilized them to eliminate the "lobby bosses," thereby gaining preliminary experience. In late March, the Transport Workers' Union further gathered more than 170 worker activists from various trades, including handcarts, porter services, loading and unloading, and horse-drawn carts throughout the city for a week of study. Subsequently, more than 30 union cadres and some of the activists who participated in the study formed four working groups and went to various districts to carry out work. According to the workers' reflections in the study class, there are still more than 50 "lobby bosses" in various trades throughout the city, each controlling dozens to more than a hundred workers. The "lobby bosses" currently have the following situations: (1) Some, like before liberation, routinely oppress and exploit workers. For example, the "lobby boss" nicknamed "King Tiger" in Guozishi in the Eighth District still controls 70 to 80 handcart workers and monopolizes local freight. (2) Some infiltrated the union, seized leadership, and exploited with new power. For example, Li Ming, a large "lobby boss" at Guang'anmen Railway Station, transformed after liberation into the director of the local railway loading and unloading management committee. Ma Tongfu, the director of the handcart workers' union in the Ninth District, is also a "lobby boss." The "lobby boss" in the Thirteenth District used to be a puppet Baozhang (local head) before liberation and became a cadre in the union after liberation. (3) Playing "guerrilla warfare": When workers in area A rise up, he takes the goods he has contracted to area B to exploit the workers in area B. (4) Using the workers' guild mentality to occupy one side and continue to exploit. For example, the "lobby bosses" Jin Da-laohu (Big Tiger) and Jin Er-laohu (Second Tiger) in the Twelfth District still dominate the Tianqiao area, and workers from other places dare not set foot there.
    After the working groups went down, the workers in various districts were in high spirits. The transport workers at Guang'anmen Railway Station immediately took action and launched an accusation struggle against the big "lobby boss" Li Ming. Since becoming the head of the porter service in 1939, Li Ming colluded with Japanese invaders and Kuomintang secret agents, privately established a public hall, raised fierce dogs, and used various cruel tortures such as hanging, electrocution, branding, and biting to harm workers. After the accusation meeting, the government received 26 complaints and dozens of pieces of paper filled with workers' names, demanding that the evil tyrant Li Ming be severely punished according to law.
    The transport workers in the Fourth District, under the leadership of the union, organized an anti-feudal team to inspect "lobby bosses" everywhere. Some small "lobby bosses" voluntarily confessed to the workers and repented, and the big "lobby bosses" dared not lobby anymore.
    In the Eighth and Ninth Districts outside Qianmen, the "lobby boss" system has been basically abolished after several months of struggle by more than 400 handcart workers. As a result of accusing and educating more than 20 large and small "lobby bosses" according to their primary and secondary responsibilities, they have bowed their heads to the workers and repented, and handed over their cargo contracting relationships to the union. Some small "lobby bosses" with fewer bad deeds have begun to work under the supervision of the workers. The workers there have their own transport organization, democratically electing liaisons to contract goods, and workers line up to pull goods in an orderly manner. The situation of fighting over goods has disappeared. The workers also have a new work attitude, not stealing or taking, and paying attention to handling goods with care. Although freight rates have been reduced compared to before, income has increased because the intermediate exploitation of the "lobby bosses" has been eliminated.
    Now, the Beijing Municipal Transport Workers' Union is preparing to thoroughly eliminate feudal forces, further investigate the number of workers and the amount of cargo handled throughout the city, strengthen worker education, establish a transport company, and unify the allocation of transport forces and the unified regulation of freight rates.

### 京市搬运工会组织工人  彻底扫除封建“搂包”制  准备成立搬运公司统一调配劳力

　　京市搬运工会组织工人
    彻底扫除封建“搂包”制
    准备成立搬运公司统一调配劳力
    【本报讯】记者林沫报道：北京市搬运工会现正发动全市搬运工人扫除封建“搂包”制，以便配合政府设立搬运公司。统治工人的“搂包”经常剥夺工人收入的百分之五十至百分之八十，并施行种种肉体迫害，工人渴望从这一黑暗的制度下得到解放。
    北京市搬运工会自今年一月全国搬运工会第一届代表会后，即开始进行此项工作。当时曾集中干部力量首先以搬运工人较多的前门车站为重点，集训搬运工人中的积极分子，发动工人清除“搂包”，从而取得初步经验。三月下旬，搬运工会更进一步集合全市排子车、脚行、装卸、大车等行中一百七十多工人积极分子，进行一星期的学习。随后，工会的三十多干部和一部分参加学习的积极分子组成四个工作组分赴各区开展工作。根据工人在学习班里的反映，现全市存在于各行中的“搂包”头尚有五十多名，每人统辖着几十至百余工人不等。“搂包”们目前约有以下几种情况：（一）有一部分和解放前一样，照例压迫剥削工人。如八区果子市的“搂包”头外号王老虎，仍统治着七八十个排子车工人，垄断着当地货运。（二）有的钻入工会，抓取领导，以新的权力进行剥削。如广安门车站大“搂包”李明，解放后一变而为该地铁路装卸管理委员会主任。九区排子车工会主任马同福也是一个“搂包”。十三区的“搂包”头子解放前曾当伪保长，解放后即钻入工会当干部。（三）打“游击战”：甲地工人起来了，他就把揽到的货带到乙地，剥削乙地工人。（四）利用工人的行会思想，使自己占据一方，继续进行剥削。如十二区的“搂包”头金大老虎、金二老虎直到如今仍独霸天桥地区，别地工人不敢涉足。
    工作组下去后，各区工人情绪很高。广安门车站搬运工人立即行动起来，向大“搂包”头子李明进行了控诉斗争。李明自一九三九年当上脚行头，先后和日寇及国民党特务勾结，私立公堂，饲养凶犬，以吊打、电烤、铁烙、嘶咬等种种苦刑残害工人。在控诉大会后，政府曾收到工人二十六张诉状和几十张满写着工人名字的纸条，要求依法严征恶霸李明。
    四区搬运工人在工会领导下组织了反封建大队，到处检查“搂包”。有些小的“搂包”自动向工人坦白悔过，大“搂包”也不敢再搂了。
    在前门外的八、九区，四百多排子车工人经过几个月的斗争，基本上已废除了“搂包”制。对二十几个大小“搂包”，根据主要、次要对他们进行控诉及教育的结果，他们已向工人低头悔改，并把自己承揽货物的关系转交给工会。有些恶迹较少的小“搂包”已开始在工人监督下进行劳动。该处工人已有了自己的搬运组织，民主选举出联络员出外承揽货物，工人排号拉货，行动很有秩序。因争抢货物而斗殴的情形已没有了。工人们并已有了新的劳动态度，不偷不拿，注意轻举轻放。运价虽已较前减低，但因免除了“搂包”的中间剥削，收入反而增加。
    现京市搬运工会准备彻底扫清封建势力后，进一步调查全市工人数目和货物运转量，加强工人教育，成立搬运公司，统一调配运输力量和统一规定运价。
