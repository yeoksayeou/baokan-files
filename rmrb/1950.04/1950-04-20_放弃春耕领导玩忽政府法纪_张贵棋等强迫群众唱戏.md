　　Abandoning Spring Planting; Leaders Neglect Government Laws and Discipline
    Zhang Guiqi and Others Force the Masses to Perform Plays
    Zhang Guiqi, the Communist Party Branch Secretary and Village Head of Dongyang Village, Fifth District, Zhengding County, Hebei Province, and He Laohei (a Party member), the Middle Team Leader, did not lead the masses in production during the spring planting season. Instead, they forced the masses to perform and watch plays. On April 4th, Zhang Guiqi and He Laohei first arranged with some loafers and some of the masses, "If anyone asks why we are performing plays, say it is for the martyrs for the Qingming Festival." They also forced the masses to stop production to build a stage. After the District Government discovered this, they immediately sent people to stop it. After explaining, the village cadres promised not to perform. But when it got dark, Zhang Guiqi and He Laohei sent a large cart to Xiyang Village to pick up the opera troupe. After hearing this, District Head Shi personally went to stop it. After arriving in Xiyang Village, District Head Shi first mobilized the opera troupe not to perform, so as not to affect their own production, and then mobilized the carts of Dongyang Village to return. Because the mobilization was ineffective, District Head Shi and Assistant Wang took the carts back to the district. While on the way, Zhang Guiqi, He Laohei, the public security officer, and the Youth League secretary of Dongyang Village, along with a dozen militiamen, chased after them with four rifles. They surrounded the district head and Comrade Wang, and forced the district head with guns, ordering him to return the carts, with a very rude attitude. Zhang Guiqi also used the excuse that "the masses want to perform plays, we can't stop them, please, District Head, explain to the masses." He forcibly pulled the district head and Comrade Wang into the cart. Only after the district head explained repeatedly did they agree not to perform. However, after Zhang Guiqi and others brought the carts back to the village, they went to Xiyang to bring the opera troupe back, and the play opened that night. Because the spring planting was too busy, the masses did not come to watch, so Zhang Guiqi and He Laohei ordered the civil affairs committee member, He Laosheng, to broadcast from the roof: "Each family must send one person to watch the play, or else." This lasted for two nights. On the 5th, while the masses were busy watering wheat, delivering manure, and harrowing the fields, Zhang Guiqi and He Laohei forced the masses to stop production and perform stilt walking and other games, which lasted for most of the day, and the masses were very dissatisfied. On April 6th, the county and district sent special personnel to resolve the issue. The government has now removed Zhang Guiqi and He Laohei from their posts and sent them to the People's Court for legal processing. The Party organization is discussing disciplinary action within the Party. Other public security officers, He Laosheng, and others have made self-criticisms to the masses, admitting their mistakes. (Gao Shungu)

(During the spring planting season, Party organizations, governments, mass organizations, etc. in rural areas should concentrate their efforts on leading the masses in production. All activities that hinder production or are unrelated to production should not be carried out. Although the forced performance of plays in Dongyang Village, Zhengding is an isolated case, the phenomenon of leaders at the county and district levels in some areas being busy with mass entertainment activities or other work that can be postponed also exists. We hope that Party committees, governments, and mass organizations in various localities will pay close attention to and promptly check and correct this. —Editor)

　　放弃春耕领导玩忽政府法纪
    张贵棋等强迫群众唱戏
    河北省正定县五区东洋村中共支部书记兼村长张贵棋、中队长何老黑（党员），在春耕期间，不领导群众生产，却强迫群众唱戏看戏。四月四日张贵棋、何老黑先在一些二流子和部分群众中布置：“如有人问为什么唱戏，就说清明节给烈士唱的”。又强制群众放下生产去搭戏棚。区政府发觉后，立即派人前往制止。经过解释，村干部们答应说不唱了。但天黑的时候，张贵棋、何老黑却又派大车去西洋村接戏。区政府闻讯后，石区长亲去制止。石区长到西洋村后先动员戏班不要去唱，以免影响自己生产，后又动员东洋村的大车回去。因动员无效，石区长与王助理员便将大车带回区里。等行至半路时，东洋村张贵棋、何老黑还有公安员、青年团书记带着十几个民兵，拿着四枝大枪追赶上来，一拥将区长和王同志围住，用枪逼着区长，令其将车放回，态度十分蛮横。张贵棋并借口“群众要求唱戏，我们制止不住，请区长去给群众解释。”硬拉区长和王同志上车，经区长再三解释才应允不唱了。但张贵棋等将车带回村后，又到西洋将戏接来，当晚开戏。因春耕过忙，群众不来看，张贵棋和何老黑命令民政委员何老生到房上广播：“一家来一个人看戏，不来不行。”一连唱了两宿。五日群众正忙于浇麦送粪耙地，张贵棋、何老黑却强制群众放下生产，扮高跷闹玩艺，直闹了多半天，群众十分不满。四月六日县区派专人前往解决，现政府已将张贵棋、何老黑撤职，并送人民法院依法处理。党组织正在讨论给予党内处分。其他公安员、何老生等都已向群众进行了检讨，承认了错误。（高顺古）
    （春耕期间，农村中的党组织和政府，群众团体等，应集中力量领导群众生产，一切妨碍生产或与生产无关的活动均不宜进行。正定东洋村强迫唱戏，虽是个别的，但某些地区的县、区各级领导忙于群众娱乐活动或其他可以缓办的工作的现象，也是存在着的。我们希望各地党委、政府和群众团体要十分注意和及时检查纠正。——编者）
