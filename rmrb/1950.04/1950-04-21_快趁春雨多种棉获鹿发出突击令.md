　　Seize the Spring Rain and Plant More Cotton: Huolu Issues a Blitz Order
    [This Newspaper News] On April 14th, Huolu, Hebei Province, experienced widespread spring rain. The county government immediately issued an emergency mobilization order to complete the cotton planting task as quickly as possible. The Huolu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also simultaneously organized cadres to go to the countryside to fully blitz the spring plowing and cotton planting. When the rain had not yet stopped on the 15th, the County Committee convened an emergency meeting to study the spring plowing and cotton planting work after the rain. The County Committee decided to issue a call to all branch party members and cadres in the county to strive to exceed the quota for completing the cotton planting task, pointing out that the spring rain brought new favorable conditions for spring plowing and planting. All party members and cadres must seize the opportunity to lead the masses in engaging in the spring plowing and cotton planting movement, and strive to exceed the county's target of planting 135,000 mu of cotton. Cadres and party members should mobilize the masses to organize mutual assistance to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock, and pay special attention to ensuring that the cotton of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families is planted on time. In the movement, all party members and cadres in the county should strive to become model branches, model cadres, and model party members.
    The County People's Government also simultaneously issued an emergency mobilization order to complete cotton planting, implementing the idea of ​​"production first," and calling on all men and women laborers in the county to mobilize together and complete the cotton planting task through mutual assistance. In order to make the masses clearly understand the important significance of cotton planting, a propaganda blitz ten-day period was launched along with the spring plowing and cotton planting blitz week. The county has again drawn out 40 cadres (63 were sent down last time), plus 18 members of the Provincial Party Committee's spring plowing inspection team, and 14 members of the Prefectural Committee's working group, totaling 135 cadres, to carry out in-depth promotion of the spring plowing and cotton planting blitz in a planned and focused manner. At 4 pm on the 15th, before the rain had stopped, County Party Secretary Hou Yong and County Chief Wei Shanqi led the cadres to set off in the rain.
