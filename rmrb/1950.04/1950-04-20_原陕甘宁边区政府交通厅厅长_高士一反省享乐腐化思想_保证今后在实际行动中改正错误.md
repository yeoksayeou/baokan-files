    Gao Shiyi Reflects on Hedonistic and Corrupt Thoughts
    Guarantees to Correct Mistakes in Future Actions
    [Our Newspaper's dispatch] The Xi'an Masses Daily on April 10th published a self-reflection by Comrade Gao Shiyi, the former director of the Communications Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. He relatively strictly examined his hedonistic and corrupt thoughts. In the same day's newspaper, an editorial was also published, calling for the promotion of the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle.
    The main errors Comrade Gao Shiyi reflected upon were his belief that he had made great contributions, leading to irresponsibility in his work, while being extremely extravagant and wasteful in his life. His family was originally a large landlord, owning more than 2,000 mu of land. Under the influence of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, he donated his family property to the anti-Japanese government, participated in the revolution, and joined the Communist Party. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the masses, he and the people together persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines and indeed did a lot for the people. However, he did not pay attention to learning and became arrogant and complacent. After entering the city of Xi'an last year, the old habits of extravagance and waste from his landlord days resurfaced. Regarding work, he was careless. Not only in handling daily work, he was often careless, sometimes even treating very important issues casually. Once, at a political affairs meeting, he should have attended to give a work report, but he used the excuse of seeing off a guest and went with the guest to the Huaqing Pool in Lintong for a bath. He paid more and more attention to enjoying life. He reflected, "In my own thinking, I believed that since I had entered a big city and was a senior cadre, I should be generous and adapt to city life. In reality, I was adapting to the parasitic and luxurious life of the bourgeoisie to make myself more comfortable." As soon as he entered Xi'an, he openly violated the entry regulations and privately moved into the former railway bureau director's mansion, bringing with him a guard, an orderly, and a manager, and also "accepted" a gardener and a cook, five people serving him alone. The expenses of this small mansion were very high. He reflected, "For example, in February, even when I was not at home, the food costs alone exceeded 400,000. If the waste I spent on eating in restaurants and entertaining guests outside were to be calculated, the amount would be even more staggering." He always bought new and beautiful things for his daily necessities. After arriving in Xi'an, he bought five Parker pens. When he went to Beijing in November last year to attend a transportation conference, he privately bought two cameras, two binoculars, and a motorcycle for personal enjoyment, as well as salted fish, sea cucumber, and other things.
    Comrade Gao Shiyi's reflection this time came after Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee called for "reviewing ideological work style and opposing extravagance and waste." With the enthusiastic help of the CPC Committee of the Military and Political Committee and relevant comrades, he thoroughly cleared up these erroneous thoughts and expressed his willingness to guarantee to correct these errors in practical actions. The Party Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee believes that Comrade Gao Shiyi's progress is welcome. As for how to deal with this error, it will continue to be discussed and decided within and outside the Party.

### 原陕甘宁边区政府交通厅厅长  高士一反省享乐腐化思想  保证今后在实际行动中改正错误

　　原陕甘宁边区政府交通厅厅长
    高士一反省享乐腐化思想
    保证今后在实际行动中改正错误
    【本报讯】四月十日的西安群众日报，发表了原陕甘宁边区政府交通厅厅长高士一同志的自我反省，他比较严格地检讨了自己的享乐腐化思想；在同天的报上，还发表了一个社论，号召发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统。
    高士一同志反省出来的主要错误，是以为自己功劳很大，对工作不负责任；在生活上却是十分铺张浪费。他的家原是一个大地主，有两千多亩田地，在抗日救亡运动的影响下，他把家产捐献给抗日政府，参加了革命，还参加了共产党。在党和群众的培养教育下，他和人民一起，坚持了敌后抗日战争，的确为人民作了不少事情。但是他不注意学习，骄傲自满，去年进了西安城之后，过去过地主生活时那种铺张浪费的老毛病又发作了。对工作马马虎虎，不只是处理日常工作，常常粗心大意，有时对很重大的问题也随随便便。有一次开政务会议，他应该出席去作工作报告，但是他借口送客，就和客人一起乘汽车到临潼华清池洗澡去了。对于生活享受，他却越来越注意。他自己反省说：“在自己思想上认为进了大城市，自己是大干部，要大方些，要适应城市生活。实际上是适应资产阶级寄生的奢侈生活，使自己更舒服些。”一进西安，他就公然违反入城纪律，私自搬进前铁路局局长的公馆，自带一个警卫员、勤务员和管理员，还“接收”了一个花匠和一个伙夫，五个人侍候他一个人。这个小公馆的开支很大，他反省说：“如二月份我还不在家，只伙食一项就超过四十多万，自己在外面进饭馆和请客方面的浪费，如果要统计一下，数目更会惊人。”他的日常生活用品，都是专买新式美好的，到西安以后，就买了五支派克钢笔；去年十一月到北京开交通会议，为了个人享用，就私自买了照像机两个、望远镜两架、摩托车一辆，还有咸鱼、海参等等其他东西。
    高士一同志这次反省，是在西北军政委员会彭德怀主席号召“检讨思想作风、反对铺张浪费”以后，经过军政委员会中共党委和有关同志的热情帮助，他比较彻底地清算了他这些错误思想，表示愿意保证在实际行动中改正这些错误。西北军政委员会党委会认为高士一同志这一进步是值得欢迎的。至于他这一错误如何处理，将在党内党外继续讨论决定。
