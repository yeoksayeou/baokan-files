　　Barren Hills Transformed into Pine Mountains
    —An Account of the Model Deeds of Yuan Shizhen, a Afforestation Hero in the Tangshan Prefecture

    On the once barren hillsides embraced by the east, west, and south sides of Junzikou Village, Eighth District, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, grow densely more than 80,000 lush pines and cypresses, standing four to five feet or twelve feet tall. These are the result of the painstaking efforts of Yuan Shizhen, a afforestation hero who attended the Tangshan Prefecture Labor Model Symposium on March 13th, who led the villagers in planting them over seventeen years.

    Yuan Shizhen, now fifty years old, is a resolute and outstanding Communist Party member. He grew up in a middle-peasant family of more than fifty people and only studied in school for three winters. To solve the village's difficulty in obtaining firewood, he had the early idea of raising trees and afforestation.

    He discussed planting pine trees with his family, but was opposed by his father and brothers, who thought it would delay farm work. When he mobilized the villagers, they also said, "Pines take a thousand years, cypresses ten thousand years, it's hard to benefit from them easily. It's better to tidy up the land and grow more grain than anything else." Although he repeatedly ran into snags, Yuan Shizhen was not discouraged. That autumn, he collected more than two catties of pine cones during breaks from work. The following spring, after several requests to his father, he was allowed to plant ten ridges on the east riverbank. By the Qingming Festival of 1937, the seedlings had grown up, so he mobilized his four younger brothers and two nephews to plant 4,600 trees in five days. As the trees gradually grew, he stacked the cut branches in bundles along the riverbank dam. When the villagers saw this, they were very envious and praised him. He took the opportunity to say to everyone he met, "Pine and cypress trees grow up in three to five years. Look at the pine twigs stacked on my dam; isn't it much better than gathering grass in the mountains?" He used facts to enlighten and educate the entire village, and they began to recognize the benefits of planting trees.

    In 1944, under the cultivation of the Party, he became the village Party branch secretary, and his work became even more active. To respond to the government's call for afforestation, he actively requested the district to mark the mountains with lime, approved the village for planting trees, and dispelled people's concerns that the barren hills were ownerless and that planting would be a waste. He also convened a branch meeting to mobilize and deploy tree planting within the Party, studying and adopting the method of using twelve catties of pine needles to replace one man-day of labor. He mobilized eighteen people to collect fourteen catties of pine cones from afar. In the spring of 1945, he led the masses to plant sixty ridges on the public land south of the village. In the winter of 1947, he again adopted the method of the village buying one catty of pine cones for half a catty of rice, mobilizing the masses to collect pine cones. In addition to leading the entire village to plant forty ridges of pine cones, he also motivated every household to collect pine cones from afar and raise sixty ridges of seedlings. By the spring of 1948, the seedlings had grown for three years and could be planted, so he divided the land by person, mobilized the masses to plant on their own, and planted 40,000 trees in a few days. In the spring of 1949, he led the masses to plant more than 20,000 trees. Every household in the village planted trees, and the barren hills surrounding the village on three sides had been transformed into verdant pine mountains.

    Over the past ten years, he has also carefully cultivated more than 400 fruit trees such as apples, pears, and walnuts, and enthusiastically mobilized and helped others plant them. Out of the 49 households in the village, 21 have now planted more than 2,000 various fruit trees, selling a lot of fruit every year, which has increased the livelihood of the villagers. In 1948 alone, Yuan Shizhen himself earned fifteen piculs of corn from selling fruit. As a result, nearby villages were also influenced and went to the village to buy seedlings. Last year, the masses of Motaisi Village, five miles south of the village, used more than one picul of corn to buy more than 3,000 pine, cypress, and fruit tree seedlings and planted them. At the beginning of March this year, just as the tree planting season arrived, Wang Wenliang from Ximazhuang, Seventh District, Fengrun County, which is tens of miles away, also came to Yuan Shizhen's home and used five pecks of corn to buy 610 pine seedlings.

    At this special district labor model symposium, Yuan Shizhen was praised by the special commissioner's office and awarded a banner and certificate.

　　荒山变成了松山
    ——记唐山专区造林英雄袁世珍的模范事迹
    在河北省遵化县八区君子口村东、西、南三面怀抱着的过去的荒山坡上，茂密的长着八万多棵四五尺或一丈二尺高的苍松和翠柏。这就是三月十三日出席唐山专区劳模座谈会的造林英雄袁世珍苦心地经过了十七年的努力，领导着该村群众栽植起来的。
    袁世珍，今年五十岁了，是一个性格坚毅的优秀共产党员。从小生长在一个五十多口人的中农家庭里，只念过三冬四书。他为要解决全庄烧柴的困难，很早便起了养树造林的念头。
    他跟家里商量栽松树，都遭到了父亲和哥哥们的反对，嫌耽误干庄稼活；跟庄里人动员也都说：“千年松万年柏，轻易借不上光，倒不如把地收拾好，多打粮食比啥都强。”虽然屡次碰钉子，但袁世珍并没有灰心。当年秋天，他趁早晚歇工的时候，采了二斤多松子。次年春天和父亲几次要求，才答应他在东河沿地上种了十畦，一九三七年清明节时，树苗已经长大起来，就动员了四个弟弟和两个侄儿，在五天里栽上了四千六百棵。树渐渐长大了，他就把砍下来的枝条，一捆一捆的垛在河边坝沿上，使庄里人看见都很羡慕和称赞，他便乘机逢人就说：“松柏树三、五年就长起来，看我坝沿上垛的松梢，不是比到山上搂草强的多吗？”用事实启发和教育了全庄的人们，开始认识了栽树的好处。
    一九四四年，在党的培养下，他当了村支部书记，工作就更积极了。为了响应政府植树造林的号召，就积极要求区里用石灰把山圈上，批准给该村栽树，打破了人们认为荒山没主怕栽了白搭的顾虑，并召开了支部会议，在党内进行动员和布置栽树，研究了采取用十二斤松荛顶一个岗工的办法，发动了十八个人，到远处去采了松子十四斤；一九四五年春天，领导群众在庄南的公地上种了六十畦，一九四七年冬，又采取由村里用半斤米买一斤松子的办法，发动了群众去采松子除领导全村群众种了四十畦松子外，并带动了家家户户也纷纷到远处去采松子，养起了六十畦树苗。到一九四八年春天，树苗已长到三年头上，可以栽了，他就按人分片，发动群众谁栽是谁的，几天里就栽了四万棵，四九年春天又领导群众栽了两万多棵。使全村家家户户都栽了树，环村三面的荒山已变成了碧绿的松山了。
    十几年里，自己并精心培植了苹果、梨、核桃等果树四百多棵，并热心的动员和帮助别人栽植，全村的四十九户人家，现在已有二十一户栽植了各种果树达两千多棵，年年卖出很多水果，给全庄人民增加了生活来源。四八年仅袁世珍自己就靠卖水果赚了十五石苞米。因此影响了附近村庄也纷纷到该村去买树苗，去年南距该村五里的莫台寺村群众，就用一石多苞米，买去了三千多棵松柏和果树苗栽上了，今年三月初，植树的时期刚到，邻县丰润七区西马庄的王文亮，离几十里路的途程，还到袁世珍家，用五斗苞米，买去了六百一十棵松树苗。
    在这次专区劳模座谈会上，袁世珍得到了专署的表扬，赠给了奖旗奖状。
