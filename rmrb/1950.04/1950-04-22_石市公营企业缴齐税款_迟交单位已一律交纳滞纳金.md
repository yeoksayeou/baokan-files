Shijiazhuang Public Enterprises Pay All Taxes; Units Have All Paid Late Payment Fees

[This newspaper reported on April 16th from Shijiazhuang Daily news]: All thirty-two state-owned public enterprises in the city have paid their first-quarter business tax, together with local surcharges, totaling 2,975,984,968 yuan. Among them, thirty paid on time (the 10th of the month). The Oils Company and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, which paid late, were charged a late payment fee of 3% per day according to law. The Oils Company paid on the 12th and paid a late payment fee of 6%. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company paid on the 13th and paid a late payment fee of 9%. This is the first time that state-owned public enterprises have been penalized in Shijiazhuang's tax collection work. In order to ensure the timely completion of tax revenue tasks, this decree will continue to be strictly enforced in the future.

The main reason for the general ability to pay taxes on time this time is that everyone has accepted the Central Committee's decision on unified financial and economic work and recognizes that paying taxes is an important task for state-owned public enterprises. At the third People's Representative Conference of all circles in the city, representatives of state-owned public enterprises proposed to ensure the timely completion of tax tasks and take the lead among the city's industrial and commercial circles. The Water Company and the Telecommunications Bureau, which paid the earliest, had responsible cadres personally go to the tax bureau to handle the formalities.

On the tax bureau's side, because the cadres attached more importance to their tasks than in the past, they went deep into each household to supervise payment, promptly answered various questions such as registration, form filling, and tax calculation, and the bureau extended office hours as much as possible to provide payers with the convenience of paying whenever they arrived.

　　石市公营企业缴齐税款
    迟交单位已一律交纳滞纳金
    【本报讯】据四月十六日石家庄日报消息：全市三十二个国营公营企业第一季营业税款已全部交齐，连同地方附加，总数共为二、九七五、九八四、九六八元，其中按期（十日）交纳的有三十个，油脂公司及花纱布公司逾期交款依法按日征收了百分之三的滞纳金，油脂公司十二日交款，交滞纳金百分之六，花纱布公司十三日交款，交滞纳金百分之九。在石家庄税收工作中，国营公营企业受罚这还是第一次，为了保证按期完成税收任务，这条法令，以后将继续严格执行。
    这次税收一般能够按期交款，主要是大家接受了中央统一财经工作的决定，认识了纳税是国营公营企业的重要任务，本市第三次各界人民代表会上，国营公营企业代表即提出保证按期完成税收任务，在全市工商界中起带头作用。交款最早的自来水公司和电信局都是负责干部亲自到税务局办理手续。
    在税务局方面，由于干部们比较过去更重视了自己的任务，深入各户督促交款，及时解答登记、填表、计算税额等各项问题，局内则尽量延长办公时间予交款者以随到随交的方便。
