　　Brief News on Afforestation in Hebei
　　After repeated publicity of the government's laws on protecting forests and the benefits of planting trees before the tree planting week last year and recently, the enthusiasm of the masses for planting trees has been raised in all counties of the Handan area. According to preliminary statistics, more than 610,000 trees have been planted in the area. In order to solve the difficulty of tree seedlings, Wu'an set up a station in Yangyi Hejin Town to purchase them. The Handan Provincial Farm, Linqing, Linzhang and other farms all provided a lot of tree seedlings to the masses. (Shu Chun)
　　The Shahe County Government and the Desert Afforestation Bureau sent a large number of cadres to the lower reaches of the Shahe River during the Spring Festival to mobilize and organize the masses. The masses along the river actively responded to afforestation because they had suffered from floods over the years. Before the vernal equinox, 980 people from Yaozhuang Village participated in labor shareholding cooperatives and planted 28,470 trees. Nanyang Village planted 100,050 trees in two or three days due to cooperative afforestation. In addition, 12,000 trees were planted privately. They mastered the techniques of deep burial, compaction, and close planting in planting techniques. And put forward the slogan of planting one tree and keeping it alive. Now the masses in the villages on both sides of the Shahe area are planting enthusiastically.

　　The masses along the Yongding River are enthusiastically planting trees and making forests. From March 14th to 17th, according to statistics from 14 villages in Daxing, Gu'an, Wuqing, and Yongqing counties alone, more than 54,000 willow trees have been planted and more than 217,000 cuttings have been buried. In Tongbai Town, Wuqing Second District, six households organized themselves to plant trees together (sharing tree saplings, and sharing dividends in the future), and plan to eliminate 90 mu of sandy wasteland this year. Under their leadership, the masses in the whole village planted 16,000 windbreak forest poles in four days. The masses in Xibai Village nearby began to plant windbreak forests from the 19th. In three years, the land will not be affected by the wind, and 2,000 bundles of Wenzi can be produced. Zhou Anqian Baiwa Village originally planned to plant 11,200 trees this spring to eliminate 33 mu of sandy wasteland. By the 17th, 15,100 trees had been completed, eliminating 47 mu of sandy wasteland, and planting is continuing. (Li Ting, Yongding River Afforestation Bureau)
