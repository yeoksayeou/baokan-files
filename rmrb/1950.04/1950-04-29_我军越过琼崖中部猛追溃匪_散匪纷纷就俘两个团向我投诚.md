Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 28th: The People's Liberation Army on the Hainan Front has crossed central Hainan Island and is fiercely pursuing the fleeing bandit troops southward. Since our army broke through the coastal defense line of Hainan Island and Haikou and Wenchang were successively liberated, the Kuomintang bandit troops have fled in panic towards the southern coastal areas of the island. Our landing troops are displaying their special skill of relentless pursuit in land operations, pursuing the fleeing bandits fiercely from both the east and west. On the eastern route, our rapid deployment troops, riding in captured military vehicles, advanced rapidly along the eastern section of the Huanfeng Highway. By the 26th, they had crossed the Wanquan River and intercepted a group of fleeing enemies at Longgun Town, south of Lehui, and crushed the headquarters and two regiments of the bandit 32nd Army's 232nd Division at Hele Town, north of Wanning. The remnants of the bandit Teaching 1st Division, 62nd Army, and others were utterly routed, abandoning weapons and wounded soldiers along the way. Scattered bandits, in groups of three or five along both sides of the highway, surrendered en masse. Another unit of our army on this route, after seizing Wenchang, advanced to Maiyu Town (south of Wenchang) on the 25th, forcing the 4th Regiment of the bandit Security 1st Division to surrender to us. Prior to this, on the 23rd near Haikou, this unit had forced officers and soldiers of the 489th Regiment of the bandit 163rd Division to surrender to us, bringing with them 23 cannons of various types and 37 light and heavy machine guns.
